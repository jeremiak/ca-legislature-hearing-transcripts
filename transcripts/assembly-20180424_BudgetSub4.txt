THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN REVENUE MILITARY THINK NOT LIKE SAYING THAT. I LOVE HEARING IT SOMETIME. ESPECIALLY WHEN I'M WATCHING THE MADAM SECRETARY. THANK YOU FOR TAKING US OUT OF ORDER. THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUR CITIZENS OUT THERE TRYING TO GET INTO THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE RIGHT NOW. AND I WANT TO JUST TAKE A FEW MINUTES IF I MAY MISTER CHAIRMAN TO AND. GIVE YOU A UPDATE ON CIVIL SERVICE IMPROVEMENT AS WELL AS PUT IT INTO CONTEXT WHERE WE ARE SO THE TAPE TRADE TRAILER BILL THAT MY COLLEAGUE MISTER REX WILL GO INTO DETAIL ON. WILL I THINK HAVE A LITTLE BIT MORE MEANING IF I MAY. AND THE GOAL OF CIVIL SERVICE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE IS TO PRODUCE A MODERN HUMAN RESOURCE SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS STATE DEPARTMENTS TO FIND AND QUICKLY HIRE. THE BEST CANDIDATES THROUGH A FAIR AND MERIT BASED PROCESS THE DEPARTMENTS WILL BE ABLE TO SYSTEMATICALLY DETERMINE THEIR WORKFORCE NEEDS AND WILL BE EQUIPPED TO TRAIN AND DEVELOP THEIR EMPLOYEES TO MAXIMIZE. THEIR INDIVIDUAL POTENTIAL TO BETTER SERVE THEIR DEPARTMENTS MISSION. AND IMPROVE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM WILL PRODUCE A CAPABLE AND ENGAGED STATE WORKFORCE THAT IS ABLE TO ADAPT TO NEW CHALLENGES AND SERVING THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WILL REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF THE POPULATION IT SERVES. THIS IMPROVE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM WILL MAKE CALIFORNIA AND EMPLOYER OF CHOICE NOT ONLY FOR PEOPLE WHO WANT A CAREER IN PUBLIC SERVICE BUT ALSO FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO MAKE A PUBLIC SERVICE. A CHAPTER IN A BROADER CAREER ESSENTIAL TO CREATING THIS ENVIRONMENT IS ESTABLISHING A LEADERSHIP CULTURE COMMITTED TO DEVELOPING AN INSPIRING EMPLOYEES. TO ACHIEVE GREAT RESULTS. MANAGERS ARE SUPPOSED IN THIS EFFORT WITH YOU ARE SUPPORTED USE ME IN THIS EFFORT WITH MODERN ONLINE TOOLS AND PROGRAMS RECRUIT TRACK AND DEVELOP EMPLOYEES. THROUGHOUT THEIR CAREERS IN STATE SERVICE POTENTIAL EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO USE MODERN TOOLS TO SUBMIT APPLICATIONS TO ALL POSITIONS FOR WHICH THEY'RE QUALIFIED. APPLICANTS SEEKING STATE JOBS ARE BETTER ABLE TO EASILY SS WHAT CAREER EXIST IN THE STATE GOVERNMENT WHAT POSITIONS MATCH THEIR SKILLS AND INTERESTS AND WHAT AVAILABLE OPENINGS FIT THAT PROFILE. THESE CHANGES ARE HELPING DEPARTMENTS BE MORE EFFICIENT AND RESPONSIVE IN THE HIRING PROCESS ONCE HIRED EMPLOYEES WILL BE PRO PROPERLY ON BOARDED. AND TAUGHT CRITICAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DEPARTMENTS AND JOB DUTIES SO THAT THEY ARE SET UP FOR SUCCESS AND CAN IMMEDIATELY START CONTRIBUTING. EMPLOYEES HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITIES LEARN NEW SKILLS AND EARNING RECOGNITION FOR DOING GOOD WORK. EXCUSE ME AS OPPORTUNITIES AND NEW TECHNOLOGIES EMERGE EMPLOYEES WILL HAVE CLEAR PATHS FOR UPWARD MOBILITY AND CAN YOU CONTINUE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. ENSURING THE EMPLOYEES BRING VALUE TO THEIR WORK AND THAT THEIR WORK ADDS VALUE TO THEIR LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT EMPLOYEES ENGAGEMENT. AND ATTRACT MOTIVATED CANDIDATES THE TEST OF THE SYSTEM SUCCESS WILL BE IN ITS ABILITY TO GET THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT JOB. AT THE RIGHT TIME ENSURING THEY HAVE THE TOOLS AND WORK PROCESSES TO COMPLETE HIGH QUALITY WORK. TO MANAGE THE CSI INITIATIVE OF THIS CAREER CIVIL SERVICE IN IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVE GOV OPS CREATED A GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE STARTING WITH AN EXECUTIVE COUNCIL. THAT WORKED WITH STATE EXPERTS ON IDENTIFYING THE MOST NEEDED IMPROVEMENTS ACSI OPERATIONS COMMITTEE REPORTING TO THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL RECRUITED AND FORMED WORK GROUPS OF STATE EMPLOYEES. WHO RESEARCH THE IMPROVEMENTS NEEDED AND DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS NEARLY TWO HUNDRED STATE EMPLOYEES AND INNER? EMPLOYEES REPRESENTATIVES HAVE WORKED ON FORTY DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS AT DIFFERENT TIMES THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS REVIEWED AND DISCUSSED WITH OPERATIONS COMMITTEE ARE PRESENTED TO THE EXECUTIVE COUNCIL. FOR APPROVAL AND IMPLEMENTATION SO ONE MIGHT ASK WHAT IS WHAT HAS CSI ACTUALLY ACHIEVED WE'VE DONE CLASS CONSOLIDATION WHICH IS CRITICAL TO OUR EFFORTS CLASS CONSOLIDATION IS THE FIRST AND FOREMOST FUNDAMENTAL STEP. IN MODERNIZING THE STATE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. CS I STARTED OFF IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD CLASS CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS OF NEARLY FOUR THOUSAND JOB CLASSIFICATIONS. ASSESSING HOW THE STATE COULD ELIMINATE SOME CLASSES AND CONSOLIDATE OTHERS INTO BROADER STATEWIDE CLASSES. ELIMINATING DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC CLASSIFICATIONS MAKES IT EASIER FOR MANAGERS TO CREATE LARGE POOLS OF QUALIFIED CANDIDATES AND ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO BROADEN THEIR SEARCH WHEN LOOKING FOR A PROMOTION. IT ALSO AVOIDS ENORMOUS WORKLOAD AND EXPENSE OF DEVELOPING OFFERING AND SCORING DEPARTMENT SPECIFIC EXAMINATIONS FOR CLASSIFICATIONS THAT DIFFER ONLY IN TITLE. BY CONSOLIDATING CLASSES EACH DEPARTMENT NO LONGER HAS TO SPEND HOURS DEVELOPING INVALIDATING EXAMINATIONS. BROADENING CLASSES REDUCES THE OVERALL NUMBER OF EXAMINATIONS NEEDED AND FOR EMPLOYEES CLARIFIES POTENTIAL CAREER PATHS THE HIRING PROCESS IS MORE NIMBLE AS EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE TO APPLY FOR CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS FOR STATE WIDE CLASSES. SURE TO RECRUITMENT AND HIRING TIMES ALLOWS THE STATE TO HIRE CANDIDATES IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER AS MANAGERS NO LONGER HAVE TO BUILD IN ADDITIONAL TIME. FOR EXAMINATION PROCESS. THESE IMPROVEMENTS ALLOW THE STATE TO FOCUS ON MUCH NEEDED RECRUITING HIRING AND ON BOARDING EFFORTS. CLASS CONSOLIDATION AND THE BENEFITS IT GENERATES PROVIDES A CRITICAL FOUNDATION FOR IMPROVE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM. SINCE JAN SINCE JUNE ONE TWENTY FOURTEEN KELLY DURING THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD HAVE ABOLISHED ONE THOUSAND TWENTY SIX CLASSES. THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM NOW HAS FEWER THAN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED CLASSES. CLASSIFICATIONS. WE'VE ABOLISHED CLASSES VACANT FOR TWO YEARS WE'VE INCREASED MULTI DEPARTMENTAL EXAMINATIONS WE'VE ELIMINATED OUTDATED EXAMINATION RULES WE HAVE SIMPLIFIED. THE LIMITED EXAMINATION AN APPOINTMENT PROGRAM LEAP AS IT IS KNOWN AS AN ALTERNATIVE. TORRENT. DIRECT EXAMINATION AN APPOINTMENT PROCESS FOR THE RECRUITMENT AND HIRING OF INDIVIDUALS WOULD JUST DO IT DISABILITIES INTO STATE SERVICE UNDER CSI THE STATE HAS ELIMINATED THE PROBATIONARY PERIOD. FOR LEAP CANDIDATES LEAVING JOB EVALUATION PERIOD ONLY. I IN THE AREA OF RECRUITING WE CHANGE CREW EXECUTIVE ASSIGNMENT RULES WHICH IS CRITICAL FOR THE HIRING OF OUTSIDE TALENT INTO THE STATE WE'VE IMPROVED STATEWIDE RECRUITMENT. WE'VE EXPANDED RECRUITMENT FOR VETERANS WE'VE CREATED A PRISON TO EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM WE'VE LAUNCHED A RECRUITING PILOT WITH LINKED IN. IN THE AREA OF TRAINING IT WE'VE EXPANDED OUR LEADERSHIP TRAINING FOR WHICH WE ARE VERY PROUD YOU ALL. WERE EXTREMELY HELPFUL WITH US IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO OVERHAUL AND DEEPEN THE LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT TRAINING REQUIRED. TO CHANGE IT WHICH READS IT REQUIRES CHANGING STATUTE AND NEW POLICY GUIDELINES ALL SUPERVISORS MANAGERS AND CA'S ARE NOW STATUTORILY REQUIRED TO COMPLETELY TO SHIP AND DEVELOPMENT TRAINING. EVERY TWO YEARS AS PRESCRIBED BY KELLY CHART. CURRICULUM FOR THE NEW TRAINING IS BUILT ON A NEW STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP PHILOSOPHY VALUES IN COMBAT SING MODEL WAS LEARNING OBJECTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH EACH LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP. THIS PROVIDES DEPARTMENTS WITH GUIDANCE ON HOW TO PROGRESSIVELY DEVELOP LEADERS FROM SUPERVISORS TO EXECUTIVE LEVEL POSITIONS. S. B. B. BEGAN AUDITING BASIC SUPERVISOR TRAINING AUGUST TWENTY SIXTEEN AND ONE CORPORATE THE CHANGES IN LAW WITH FUTURE AUDITS. WE'VE DEVELOPED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS WE'VE STREAMLINED PROCESSES AND ORGANIZATIONAL DEVELOPMENT BY CREATING LEAN TRAINING WE'VE LAUNCHED THE FIRST STATEWIDE EMPLOYEE. ENGAGEMENT SURVEY MAJORITY OF OUR EMPLOYEES I'M HAPPY TO SAY BELIEVE WHAT THEY DO IS IMPORTANT TO THE LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS FROM OUR SURVEY. HOWEVER EMPLOYEES FEEL WE DO NOT RISKS THEY DO NOT RECEIVE ENOUGH RECOGNITION OF THE GOOD WORK THAT THEY DO. SO GOV ABSENT CALYX AE WORKING TOGETHER ON EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT AND IN FACT IN TWO WEEKS GOV OPS IS HOSTING A SERIES OF FIVE EVENTS UP AND DOWN THE STATE TIM. MARKET PUBLIC SERVICE RECOGNITION WEEK THAT'S MAY SEVENTH THROUGH MAY ELEVENTH IF YOU'RE INTERESTED. WE REVISED THE STATE'S WORKFORCE PLANNING MODEL REVISED UPWARD MOBILITY GUIDELINES WE'VE CREATED NEW EMPLOYEE ONBOARDING AN ORIENTATION INFORMATION. WE'VE RECREATED CREATED THE HUMAN RESOURCE CREDENTIALING PROGRAM. IN CONCLUSION MISTER CHAIRMAN THE CSI PROCESS TO DATE HAS INVOLVED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED STATE EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES REPRESENTATIVES MOST OF THEM SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS. WHO'VE CONTRIBUTED THROUGH FORTY DIFFERENT WORK GROUPS AT DIFFERENT TIMES THEY PUT FORWARD THE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE CSI COUNCIL. FOR APPROVAL. CSI TRAILER BILL FOR WHICH WE'RE HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY WE ARE PROPOSING VARIOUS TECHNICAL CHANGES THAT WILL CONTINUE THE IMPROVEMENT OF THE CIVIL SERVICE IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM. AS I'VE RUN THROUGH TODAY WITH ME TODAY IS DAY REX AND THAT HE WILL WORK WALKS THROUGH QUICKLY THE SPECIFICS OF OUR CSI TRAILER BILL THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THE NAVY'S MY NAME IS DAVE REX AND I'M FROM THE GOVERNMENT OPERATIONS AGENCY. THIS TRAILER BILL MAKES TECHNICAL CHANGES IN THREE AREAS IT REMOVES BARRIERS FOR PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. CLARIFIES THE ROLE BETWEEN THE STATE PERSONNEL BOARD AND KELLY PRACTICES. TO HELP RECRUIT MORE PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES INTO STATE GOVERNMENT. WE WANT TO MODIFY THE LIMITED EXAMINATION AN APPOINTMENT PROCESS OR LEAD. LEAP AS SECRETARY MENTIONED IS AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF TESTING AVAILABLE TO PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT THAT LEAD CANDIDATES HAD TO SERVE A PROBATIONARY PERIOD. PRIOR TO THIS CHANGE ELITE CANDIDATE IN ESSENCE HAD THE SERVE TWO PROBATIONARY PERIODS. BECAUSE THEY WERE ALREADY EVALUATED THROUGH THE JOB EVALUATION. OUR PROCESS. THIS TRAILER BILL CLARIFIES IT ONCE A LEAD CANDIDATE PASSES HIS OR HER JOB EVALUATION. THEY WILL BECOME PERMANENT EMPLOYEES. IT ALSO GIVES THE ABILITY FOR CULTURE TO MERGE A LEAP REFERRAL LISTS. AT THAT NON LEAP HIRING LISTS. THIS HELPS MITIGATE ANY UNCONSCIOUS BIAS IN THE HIRING PROCESS. IN THIS IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT REGULATION. A SECOND AREA IS TO CLARIFY THE RULES BETWEEN SUPER SNOWBOARD AND KELLY CHAR. THIS IS A LEFT OVER FROM THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN GOVERNOR'S REORGANIZATION. PLAN NUMBER ONE. THE GOVERNOR'S REORGANIZATION PLAN REORGANIZED STATE PERSONAL BOARD IN COLLEGE ARE BY VESTING IN COUCH ARE THE POWERS DUTIES AND AUTHORITIES NECESSARY. TO OPERATE THE CIVIL SERVICE SYSTEM PURSUANT TO CIVIL SERVICE LAWS AND BOARD RULES. GIVEN THE NEW RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN STATE PERSONAL BOARD AND CULTURE ARE A FEW STATUTES REQUIRE TECHNICAL CLEANUP TO REFLECT THE NESTON NECESSITY OF COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES. BUT LASTLY. WE WANT TO REMOVE OUTDATED PRACTICES CURRENTLY FOUND STATUTES. WE BELIEVE OUR CHANGES IMPROVE THE EXAM PROCESS BY ALLOWING FOR THE USE OF MORE CONTINUOUS EXAMS. AS THE SECRETARY MENTIONED EARLIER WE WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR JOBSEEKERS TO TAKE EXAMS. CREATE LARGER CANDID POOLS INTO REDUCE DEPARTMENTAL EXAM COSTS. WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR MPLOYEES TO TRANSFER TO DIFFERENT POSITIONS WITHIN THE STATE. THIS GIVES STAFF THE ABILITY TO GAIN A BROADER. SET OF SKILLS AND CAN PENSION POTENTIALLY FIND A BETTER JOB PERSON MATCH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME I'D BE HAPPY ANSWERING QUESTIONS THANK YOU A FINANCE. A TEAR IN THE PROPOSAL. LL. NEXT ROTOR WITH THE LA GO OVER GENERALLY SUPPORTIVE WITH THE MINISTRATIONS OF GOALS OF IMPROVING THE CIVIL SERVICE AND WE RAISED NO OBJECTIONS TO THESE SPECIFIC TRAILER BILL. QUICK. I'M EXCITED BUT WE PROGRAM LIKE IT'S GOOD AND ENTIRELY AND LINK QUESTLOVE HAVE HEARD A LOT OF COMPLAINTS FROM. PEOPLE OUT AGENCIES THAT THERE. THE HIRING PROCESS IS QUITE CUMBERSOME THERE'S REALLY NO STANDARD MAY DRAG OUT. THE OFFICIAL COME OUT PEOPLE TO HAVE PATIENCE AND ALSO THE NEXT YOU KNOW THE RETESTING AGAINST THOSE WE KNOW STANDARD WITHIN A SET NUMBER DAYS TO. YOU KNOW CLOSING DATE AND TO HAVE THAT YOU KNOW THE PROCESS BEGINS SO CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT. YOU'RE NOT WEARING IT JUST IN A DIFFERENCE INCIDENTS THAT SOULFLY LOAD AS JULIAN AFFECTING JUST DRAGGING OUT I'VE HEARD. A NUMBER REPORTS ON THAT. WELL ON. IT WEDNESDAY EXAMINATION HAS BEEN TAKE HAS TAKEN PLACE AND IT'S IT'S BEEN SCORED AND PEOPLE CAN BE INTERVIEWED. OFF THAT SCORING. IT'S REALLY UP TO THE DEPARTMENTS TO DO A VERY TIMELY HIRING PROCESS BUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I'VE MENTIONED A MISTER CHAIRMAN TODAY. HAVE IMPROVED ON THAT TIME FRAME IN TERMS OF RECRUITMENT TO. TESTING TO SCORING EXAMINATIONS AND TO THEN THE HIRING PANEL AND PROCESS IT THIS IS EVEN TESTING SO MUCH AS TOUCHED ON THE ISSUE CARE FOR MYSELF IT'S FOR EXISTING EMPLOYEES THAT ARE. PROMOTING TWO DIFFERENT CLASS SO I SEARCH AND IT'S IT'S JUST IS DRAGGING OUT BECAUSE THERE IS NO STANDARD AND THAT'S THAT'S A THING OF THE STATE BECAUSE YOU HAVE DIFFERENT AGENCIES AND THERE'S. REALLY DIFFERENT STANDARDS IS THERE THOUGHT ABOUT. ABOUT FORMALIZING THAT. THE IT'S PART OF OUR OVERALL PACKAGE REDUCING THE NUMBER OF CLASSES. FOLKS. EASIER OPPORTUNITY TO TRANSFER WITHIN THE STATE. REDUCES A NUMBER OF. EXAM SO THEY CAN TAKE IT CONTINUES EXAM WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ONLINE CONTINUES EXAMS CURRENTLY. SO. RATHER THAN WAIT FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE BE EVERY TWO YEARS OR THEY'RE GONNA BE STUCK. WERE ENCOURAGING DEPARTMENTS TO MOVE TOWARDS CONTINUES EXAM SO BOOKS CONTESTS GET ON THE LIST AND APPLY FOR VACANCIES. SO IT'S ONE OF THAT ANSWER QUESTIONS. OWE A LITTLE BIT BUT BARRING CERTAIN. CIRCUMSTANCES FOR INSTANCE IF YOU PUT A JOB ANNOUNCEMENT. IS IT REQUIRED GOALS IN A CERTAIN PERIOD OF NUMBER OF TIMERS AT LEFT EACH AGENCY DECIDE BUT THAT TIME PERIOD WILL BE. HOPEFULLY THEY DO A VERY TIMELY BECAUSE THEY ARE THE HIRING AGENCY AND THEY SHOULD WANT THAT THAT UP POSITION FILLED AS SOON AS POSSIBLE BUT THERE IS A TIME FRAME GENERALLY SPEAKING. RICHARD YOU WANT TO SPEAK TO THIS. RICHARD GO HAND CULTURE DIRECTORS I I I JUST WANTED TO JUMP IN WITH GOV SO I GETTING TO THE QUESTION YOU ASKED THERE IS. NOT ANY MEANT. THERE'S NOT A SET TIME FOR HOW LONG THE JOB CAN BE ADVERTISED BUT THERE IS A MINIMUM AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE RECOMMEND. SO THAT THE PEOPLE HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE IT AND YOU KNOW IT'S PART OF A MERIT SYSTEM. OUT RELATIVE TO HOW LONG IT TAKES FROM THE TIMES MY SUBMITS AN APPLICATION FOR A JOB. TOLD THEY DO INTERVIEWS THAT'S REALLY A MATTER OF HOW HIGH PRIORITY BITS FOR THE DEPARTMENTS WE'VE ENCOURAGED DEPARTMENTS THROUGH. OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS AND OUR ADMIN. SORT OF WORKING GROUPS THAT WE OVERSEE. TARA. BE MORE EXPEDITIOUS IN THIS BECAUSE WE LOSE TOO MANY APPLICANTS THEY THEY WAIT TOO LONG IT MAY TAKE A JOB WITH THE CITY YEAR WITH THE COUNTY YEARS OR SOMEWHERE ELSE BECAUSE WE DON'T GO BACK ON TIMELY. AND WE'RE ALSO ENCOURAGING DEPARTMENTS TO BE BETTER ABOUT. LETTING FOLKS KNOW WHERE THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF THEIR NOT AGAIN JUST HANGING OUT THERE AND WHERE WERE AUTOMATING SOME OF THAT IN. OUR ECO SAN ARE A CALPERS WEBSITE. THAT. WE HAVE TWO PHASES OF WERE STILL BUILDING OUT ONE WE JUST READ ONE OUT THAT'S THE. APPLICATION WIZARD IT'S SORT OF LIKE TURBOTAX FOR TRYING APPLYING FOR A JOB WALKS YOU THROUGH THE PROCESS. WE'RE DOING A SECOND PIECE ON THAT THAT. DOES THE SAME THING FOR THE EXAM PROCESS AND IN THE THIRD PIECE WHICH WILL BE OUT BY SUMMER IT GETS TO I THINK WHAT MORE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT AND IT'S A SUMMARY SCREEN IT TELLS. A JOB APPLICANT WHERE THEY ARE IN A PROCESS WHAT EXAM LIST THERE ON. WHAT? JOBS I'VE APPLIED FOR IN THE STATUS OF THOSE THINGS SO WE WE HOPE ALL OF THAT PROVIDES MORE TIMELY INFORMATION TO PEOPLE BOTH TRYING TO GET A STATE JOB FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THOSE TRYING TO MOVE WITHIN THE SYSTEM. SO. A LOT EFFORTS ON THAT FRONT. OKAY THANK YEAH IT'S DIFFERENT HAVING WORKED FOR COUNTY. INVOLVED THE HIRING PROCESS IN THE CITY. AND THEN. FOR THE STATE BEFORE I CAME HERE SO. I'VE GOT DISEASE LAW DIFFERENT THINGS AND. IT WOULD DO A GREAT JOB BUT I'M THIS LOT MORE WORK TO DO SO THIS PARABLE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. EMOTIONS BECAUSE ITEM. CHEMICALS PUBLIC COMMENT I DO HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION UNDER THE PROPOSED LIMITS GO FAR ENOUGH TO ACHIEVE MEANINGFUL CIVIL SERVICE CHANGES. DO THESE THAT WHERE A RECKONING IN THE TRAILER BILL CORRECT THERE'S ALWAYS MORE WORK TO BE DONE CIVIL SERVICE IMPROVEMENT I SEE IS A LONGER TERM EFFORT. AND THERE ARE OTHER POLICY AREAS IT YES STILL NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. OKAY. MISTER BUREAU IN QUESTIONS. I DON'T THINK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND JUST ONE MORE QUESTION OF WHAT THE OVERALL GOAL FOR THE CIVIL SERVICE CHANGES. TO IMPROVE OUR SYSTEM TO TO JUST AS YOU ASKED OF US AND MISTER CHAIRMAN WE NEED TO RECRUIT PEOPLE IN A MORE TIMELY WAY WE NEED TO HAVE. A PROCESS THAT IS NIMBLE THAT MORE IS MORE LIKE WHAT THEY'RE USEDTO IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR OR OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR. WE CRY ON HIRING FORUMS WEEK WE HAVE TO BRING OURSELVES AND OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. MOST OF OUR POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TRULY DATE BACK INTO THE SIXTIES AND SEVENTIES. THERE IT JUST TO FOLLOW UP I MEAN OBVIOUSLY SOME. WHEN YOU SIMILAR APPLICATION OR WHATEVER IT IS. MOST. JOB UP PIECES OF CLOSING DATE AND SUMMER OPEN ENDED INTO UNTIL PHIL. BUT IT WOULD BE ISSUES SEE. HOW THESE DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING AND I REALIZE SOME HAVE PARTIES AND SOME DON'T BUT? I THINK REALLY WANNA HOME ON THAT SOME DEPARTMENTS ARE JUST. YOU KNOW THE IN RETESTING JUST BECAUSE ARE DRAGGING THEIR FEET SO. MAYBE HAVE SOME TYPE OF STANDARD WERE STANDARDIZED THAT'S WITHIN THE BIGGEST THING. IT'S JUST IF IF IF WE DON'T. ISSUE DIRECTIVES AGAIN LEAVE THE UPTOWN DEVICES AND WE NOT ACCOMPLISH THESE THINGS SO. IF YOU COULD ADDRESS THAT SOMEHOW THAT WE AGREE FULLY WITH YOU I MEAN AS AS MISTER CALLAHAN JUST SAID. THE HIRING MANAGER SHOULD MAKE HIRING A PERSON A PRIORITY SO THEY CAN GET THE WORK OF THE PEOPLE DONE QUICKLY AND WHERE A HUNDRED PERCENT BEHIND THAT AT ALL TIMES EVEN DONE SOME LEAN. PROCESSES AND SOME OF OUR AGE OUR SHOPS TO. AND CUT DOWN ON THE NUMBER OF PROCESSES THAT THE DEPARTMENTS GO THROUGH. TO HIRE PEOPLE WE'VE DONE THAT AND NUMEROUS OTHER DEPARTMENTS AND IT'S HELPED A LOT. GREAT THANK YOU MADAM SECRETARY LITTLE THIS ITEM OPEN. I THINK. LET'S REMOVE ONTO ISSUE NUMBER TWO. BUT BROWN THAT OKAY ALSO PLANNING AND RESEARCH SINCE THOUGHT REACH GOOD AFTERNOON. GOOD AFTERNOON. THE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND STAFF I AM DE THIS KENTUCKY FOR THE DIRECTOR OF THE COMPLETE COUNT. SUCH TWENTY TWENTY THIS'LL BE MY THIRD DECENNIAL CENSUS IN THIS ROLE. AS YOU MAY BE AWARE IN THE TWO THOUSAND UP EFFORT THE STATE MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT OUTREACH TO SUPPORT THIS FEDERAL OPERATION. THE LESSONS LEARNED ABOUT THAT EFFECTIVE. OUTREACH HAS CARRIED THROUGH EVEN TWO DECADES. LATER. WE REALLY ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSED AROUND A COORDINATED EFFORT CROSS SECTORIAL WHICH WILL ENGAGE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TRUSTED MESSENGERS. PUTTING QUESTIONNAIRE ASSISTANCE CENTERS IN THE RIGHT PLACES AT THE RIGHT TIME STAFF WITH THE RIGHT PEOPLE. AND DOING A MULTI LINGUAL MIGRATORY GATED MULTI MEDIA OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. THIS PROPOSAL THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT WAS INITIALLY DRAFTED FOLLOW LAST YEAR AND DID NOT IMAGINE THE ADDITIONAL BARRIERS WE ARE NOW FACING ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WHICH MAY IMPACT THE ABILITY OF THE U. S. CENSUS BUREAU TO COLLECT AND COMPLETE AND ACCURATE COUNT ACROSS THE NATION BUT MAINLY HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO I AM HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL REQUESTING FORTY POINT THREE MILLION AND TWENTY TWO LIMITED TERM POSITIONS TO STAFF THE CALIFORNIA COMPLETE COUNT EFFORT. TO COMPLEMENT THE US CENSUS BUREAU'S OUTREACH. FOCUSSING ON HARD TO COUNT POPULATIONS. THIS PROPOSAL REQUEST THE FUNDING TO BE APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND AVAILABLE FOR THE DURATION OF THE THREE YEAR EFFORT CROSSING OVER FISCAL YEARS TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. TWENTY NINETEEN. TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. FINANCE THINK HERE BECKER KIRK DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS INCLUDING THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET COMBINED WITH TEN MILLION DOLLARS PROVIDED IN THE CURRENT YEAR. REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FUNDS NECESSARY TO AID IN A COMPLETE CAO OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE SOME UNCERTAINTY AS THE FUNDS NECESSARY DEPEND ON U. S. CENSUS BUREAU ACTIONS. THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION REGARDING THE INCLUSION OF A CITIZENSHIP QUESTION ON THE CENSUS QUESTIONNAIRE. AND FUTURE COSTS OF MEDIA ADVERTISING WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THE CENSUS EFFORT. ELIOT. CAROLYN SHE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE GIVEN THE SUBSTANTIAL IMPACT OF OF THE CENSUS ON THE COUNTY CALIFORNIA. A ON A FEDERAL FUNDING RECEIVED BY CALIFORNIA WE DO I BELIEVE THAT. ICE A STATE OUTREACH EFFORT IS IN THE STATE'S FISCAL INTEREST. BUT YOU. AND THE RIVER A COUPLE QUESTIONS I'M ONLY STAFF DO YOU HAVE IN PLACE THIS TIME. SO THAT WE COUNT UMPS IT'S TWENTY TWENTY OF US OFFICE HAS FILLED FOR POSITIONS OUT OF THE SIX THAT WERE APPROVED FOR THIS FISCAL YEAR. THEY INCLUDE MYSELF THE DIRECTOR I HAVE MY DEPUTY DIRECTOR MY SISTER DIRECTOR OF MARKETING COMMUNICATIONS AND OUR OFFICE MANAGER AND COMPLETE COUNT COMMITTEE LIAISON THEY'RE JUST SITTING THERE IN THE SECOND ROW. ON THE TIMELINE TO HIRE THE TWO ADDITIONAL POSITIONS WHICH ARE THE ASSISTANT DIRECTOR OF EXTERNAL MEDIA RELATIONS AND THE ASSIST DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH POSITION IS WITHIN SIXTY DAYS. WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY RECRUITING THESE POSITIONS IN OUR HAVE CONDUCTED SOME INTERVIEWS AND THE POSITIONS ARE CURRENTLY ADVERTISE ON CALLIE CHARTER. THEIR WEBSITE THE CAPITAL MORNING REPORT AND ON OTHER GOVERNMENTAL. WEBSITES. NO THAT'S FOR THIS YOU. KNOW. HOW YOU GOING TO SET UP THE PROPOSED CONTRACTS WITH A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS GIVEN THE SMALL SIZE OF YOUR TEAM? SO WE HAVE IN THE PROPOSAL MOVING FORWARD SIXTEEN ADDITIONAL SPOTS A TOTAL OF TWENTY TWO. SO WE HAVE. DECIDED TO DIVIDE UP OF A PIECE OF THOSE THAT WILL FOLLOW UNDER OUR DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CONTRACT MANAGEMENT. IT IS VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE DO CONTRACTS AND NOT GRANTS TO ENSURE THE COUNT ABILITY A ALSO UNDER OUR DIRECTOR OF OUTREACH WILL HAVE REGIONAL. OUTREACH MANAGERS WHO WON'T JUST BE DOING OUTREACH BUT THEY'RE ACTUALLY PROVIDING THAT SECOND LAYER OF ACCOUNTABILITY BECAUSE I'LL HAVE TO REVIEW ALL THE PLANS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS AND HOW THEY ARE SPENDING IT DOWN ON THE GROUND. IN YOUR MIND IS F. SUFFICIENT STAFFING. THE TWENTY TWO YES. IN A TWO THOUSAND WE HAVE FIFTY FIVE STAFF. SO THAT I TAKE THAT AS A NO THEN. AND. I THINK WITHIN THE ADDED BARRIERS THAT WE'RE FACING. I THINK FOR THE FORTY MILLION WEEK ITSELF IF THE CASINO. I SUIT WEEK WE ALL YOUR MONTHS TORRANCE HERE YES REALIST SUPPORT. MORE STAFF BECAUSE IT IS A BIG JOB THE MORE WE GO OUT INTO THE COMMUNITY AND THE MORE WE'RE HEARING ABOUT THE FEAR THAT'S OUT THERE. IT WAS GOOD THAT THE AROUND THAT. WHO'S GOING TO ADMINISTER AND MONITOR THE PROPOSED CONTRACTS. A COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS SO WE YOUR DIVIDING THE STATE UP. THE DEMOGRAPHICS RESEARCH UNIT AT THE O. F. IS DIVIDED THE STATE UP INTO ELEVEN REGIONS UM IN TWO THOUSAND WE I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY REASONS WE HAD THERE BUT WE ALSO HAD WHAT WE CALLED ADMINISTRATIVE CBO'S. WHICH ARE BUSY NAY THE COULD BE FOUNDATIONS WE USE THE LA URBAN LEAGUE FOR EXAMPLE DOWN IN LOS ANGELES IS A REALLY COMMUNITY ENGINE NGOS COMING ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE CAPACITY. TO REACH INTO THE AUDIENCE. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO REACH HER TO COMPETITIONS BUT THEY WILL BE DOING PRETTY MUCH THE ADMINISTRATIVE TASK OF MONITORING. AND MAKING SURE THAT THE ANA BOOTS ON THE GROUND ARE DOING WHAT THEY'RE SAY THERE SAY THEY'RE DOING. PERHAPS IT WOULD JUST COUPLE OR QUESTIONS COME HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE CENSUS. IS IN PLACE BY NEXT YEAR. SO WE HAVE A PLAN OF FOR THE SIXTEEN ADDITIONAL POSITIONS A CONTINGENT THEIR APPOINTMENTS AS A CONTINGENT UPON. THE BUDGET APPROVAL A WE'LL BE POSTING THOSE. RIGHT AWAY IN TERMS OF WE HAVE TO GO THROUGH THE CAL H. ARE HIRING PROCESS. SO. AND RECRUITMENT I'M ALWAYS LOOKING FOR LOOKING FOR GREAT PEOPLE SO THE MORE YOU CAN TELL PEOPLE TO COME ABOARD. BUT HE ESCRIBIR OF THE QUESTIONS. NO QUESTIONS JUST JUST COMMENTS I THINK THIS PARTICULAR CENSUS CYCLE IS GOING TO BE MORE DIFFICULT THAN IN PREVIOUS YEARS. AND I WANT TO CAUTION THAT BOND PART OF WHAT HAPPENED IN IN IN MY DISTRICT IS THAT. BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER OF FAMILIES THAT HAVE. FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD AND MIXED IMMIGRATION STATUS. THEY'VE BEEN TOLD NOT TO ANSWER DOORS ENOUGH TO GIVE ANY INFORMATION OUT AND. TO BE VERY WARY OF ANYBODY COMING ASKING FOR INFORMATION SO WE'RE GOING TO REALLY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME. GETTING GOOD ANSWERS AND PART OF THE CHALLENGE IN THE REGION AS WELL IS THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE FAMILIES LIVING IN ONE BEDROOM AND TWO BEDROOM APARTMENTS SO. YOU MAY END UP. GETTING ONE PERSON LIVES IN THE APARTMENT BUT UNLESS THEY GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION ON EVERYBODY AND THAT A STUDY WAS JUST JOT DOWN. RECENTLY I WAS JUST RELEASED LAST WEEK ON FARM WORKER HOUSING AND. SHOWED THAT A LARGE PERCENTAGE OF THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN IN. ARE RESIDENCES ARE. LIVING WITH ON. THEY'RE NOT FAMILY MEMBERS AND THAT IN THE IN OTHER WORDS THEY'RE RENTING THE SPACE BUT THEY'RE NOT BY BLOOD RELATED AND SO. WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS TASK AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING INFORMATION UNLESS WE CAN GET THE TRUST OF THE COMMUNITY SO I WANT TO WORK WITH YOU IT MAY MAKE SENSE TO. INCLUDE THE LEGISLATURE IN WHATEVER PLANS THAT YOU YOU UTILIZE SO THAT WE CAN GET AS MUCH DONE ELECTRONICALLY SO NO ONE'S GOING OUT TO PEOPLE'S HOUSES AND SO I WANT TO BE HELPFUL IN THAT. IN THAT PROCESS SO I KNOW THAT. YOU'RE GONNA BE PUTTING ALL THAT INTO THAT INTO THAT FRAMEWORK THAT WE HAVE TO WORK TO WORK FROM BUT. THE MORE THAT WE GET THE MESSAGE OUT THAT WE NEED THIS INFORMATION IT'S NOT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE PICKED UP AND DEPORTED BUT BE SO THAT THEY CAN BE COUNTED. AND THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT WE GET RESOURCES FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WE GOT TO MAKE THAT CLEAR. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND WILL BE IN YOUR DISTRICT ON THE THIRTY FIRST RIGHT IN MAINE SALINAS URBAN ECONOMIST GABRIELLE'S COMMENTS IN ITS TRUEST YOU TO STAND UP AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WANT TO BE INVOLVED IN HELP WE TALKED ABOUT AT LENGTH AMONG SOME MEMBERS IN OUR CAUCUS A WITH STAFF WE DISCUSSED YESTERDAY LINK. AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT UNDER CAPITOL ONE ARE IMMIGRANTS AFRAID. IT OBVIOUSLY IS CALIFORNIA STANDS TO LOSE A LOT OF FUNDING. WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN SO WE WANT TO AS MUCH AS WE CAN. TO ASSURE FOLKS THAT WE NEED THE INFORMATION. OF THIS HELPS CALIFORNIA HELPS US ALL. SO THIS POINT ONE OF THE PUBLIC COMMENT. SO THOSE ARE TO SPEAK PLEASE COME FORWARD. IT'S OKAY TO SAY ME TOO. WE KNOW WE NEED TO FUND THIS MORE AND. WERE SUPPORTIVE OF IT SO REALLY MAKE THIS HAPPEN SO. WE'VE GOT A. FAIRLY FEE AGENDA SO. PLEASE BE BRIEF IN YOUR COMMENTS. HI GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS JOSEPH BEGIN ATTRACT A POLICY WHICH HAS LED THE COALITION FOR HUMANE IMMIGRANT RIGHTS JEALOUS PART OF THE CENSUS POLICY ADVOCATES IN NETWORK A COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS AMONG.

PICKING THE TRIALS OF IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A FEEL PLAN FOR THEM IN REGARDS TO THE ELECTRONIC. MODEL THAT THE CENSUS IS MOVING FORWARD LATER BECAUSE ARE GIVEN A LOT OF COMMITTEES OF COLOR DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO TO THOSE SERVICES TO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IN IN IN COMBINATION OF THAT PLANNED TO TAKE TO TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION IN ADDITION TO THAT CHANNEL HAS DIFFERENT OFFICES IN SUMMER GUARDINO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN LA. AND SO WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT PLAN FROM DIFFERENT REGION GIVING THEM ALL ALL ALL SCI FI ASSAULT AND WOOD THAT WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FOR MORE FUNDING IS SPECIFICALLY FOR. OUR REGION EDUCATION FIVE FOUR DOES ARE TO RETALIATES OUR INDIVIDUALS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AMBER'S MARTHA GROW REPRESENTING THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT OF THE BUDGET ALLOCATION OF THE FORTY POINT THREE MILLION. AND ALSO AN ADDITIONAL EIGHT POINT SEVEN MILLION SPECIFIC FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY WE ARE THE HARDEST TO SURVEY COUNTY IN THE NATION. NEARLY FORTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COUNTIES HOUSEHOLDS ARE IN HARD TO SURVEY CENSUS TRACTS WHICH MAKES THE COUNTY HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO AN UNDERCOUNT. THE CALCULATION AS WELL FOR THIS FIGURE WAS MADE BEFORE THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DECISION TO INCLUDE A QUESTION ON CITIZENSHIP ON THE CENSUS FORM WE NEED TO ACCURATELY PUT THAT INFORMATION DOWN IN ORDER FOR THE SENSES TO BE COUNTED. THAT'S WHY IT ISN'T IT HIM IMPERATIVE THAT WE INCLUDE. ALL THE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THE COUNTY'S GREATEST ASSETS IN THE CENSUS EFFORT IS OUR EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE LIKELY COUNTY LIBRARIES AND FACILITIES AND THE ABILITY TO REACH OUR EXISTING CLIENTS THAT IS ON GETTING ACCESS TO OUR SERVICES. AND THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP OUR CLIENTS HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH OUR. COUNTY EMPLOYEES AND. AND AND AND OUR IN OUR FACILITIES THE CENSUS EFFORT IS A PARTNERSHIP ALSO WITH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS EIGHTY EIGHT CITIES AND ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY UNINCORPORATED AREAS. AND THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS HAVE STRONG TIES WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. THE COUNTY WOULD UTILIZE FUNDS FROM THE LOCAL CCC'S ALLOCATION TO SUPPORT THE LOCAL REGION WIDE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH CAMPAIGN. NOT ONLY DOES THE COUNTY WERE COLLECTIVELY WITH THE CBO'S TO ENSURE AND SUPPORT THEIR EFFORTS AND WILL COMPETE COMMUNITIES BUT WE ALSO FILL IN THE GAPS. FOR OTHER GROUPS THAT DO NOT FALL WITHIN THE REACH OVER CBO PARTNERS. SUCH GROUPS INCLUDE THE ELDERLY DISABLED RENTERS INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN CROWDED HOUSEHOLDS THAT JUST WHICH YOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLY MEMBER COVER YOUR. AND I'M INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN RURAL AREAS LIKE ANTELOPE VALLEY FOR EXAMPLE THE HOMELESS THOSE IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE MILITARY VETERANS AND BUSINESSES AMONGST OTHERS THE COUNTY RELIES ON THE CENSUS DRIVE DICK SENT. MIX A TO SIX IS THE BASIS OF FOR FEDERAL FUNDING ALLOCATIONS FOR PROGRAMS THAT SERVE VULNERABLE RESIDENTS SUCH AS MEDICAID. FOSTER CARE ASSISTANCE TEMPORARY ASSISTANCE FOR NEEDY FAMILIES AND SECTION EIGHT HOUSING. THEREFORE ADMIT ALSO ONE MORE THING. JUST REFERENCE WHAT BROUGH WHAT THE REDUCTION LOOKS LIKE A PROVIDED A COUPLE OF CHARTS ON DEMONSTRATING THE SIGNIFICANT CUT OF THE AXIS TWO SENSES. INFORMATION BY THE FEDERAL.% RESOURCES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED SO YOU CAN SEE THE DIFFERENCE SO THEREFORE WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT WE ARE REQUESTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I INGRAM ACLU OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT OF INCREASE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO DO CENSUS OUTREACH TO ENSURE THEY GET AN ACCURATE COUNT AND CALIFORNIA GETS ITS FULL SHARE. OF FEDERAL SAFETY NET PROGRAMS THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M CENTER CERAM SANTANA REPRESENTING CHINESE FOR AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WE ARE A CIVIL RIGHTS COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. AND SINCE OUR FOUNDING IN NINETEEN SIXTY NINE WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN EVERY CENSUS FOR THE LAST FIVE DECADES. OUR COMMITMENT TO CENSUS IS CONSTANT IT'S TO ENSURE A FAIR AND ACCURATE COUNT FOR HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES. I'M ALL OF THIS EXPERIENCE HAS REALLY TAUGHT US MANY LESSONS BUT THE KEY LESSON IS. THAT CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY WILL BE LOST OR ONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. AND FOR US TO WIN WE BELIEVE THERE ARE THREE CRUCIAL COMPONENTS THAT NEED TO BE IN PLACE. FIRST WELL WE'RE ASKING THE LEGISLATURE TO INCREASE THE FUNDING FOR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION OUTREACH. THE RESEARCH SHOWS AND OUR EXPERIENCE SHOWS THAT THE HARD TO REACH COMMUNITIES ESPECIALLY THE IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY. REALLY SEE THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS TRUSTS HAVE MEANT MESSENGERS AND WE WOULD ASK FOR THEIR ROLE TO PAY OUT FUNDED MORE. SECONDS CALIFORNIA REALLY NEEDS A LANGUAGE ACCESS PLAN FOR THIS TO BE DONE RIGHT AND WE'RE DELIGHTED AND HAPPY TO SEE THE STAFF RECOMMENDATIONS TO HAVE SUCH A PLAN. BUT I WOULD ALSO ASK THAT IN SUCH A PLAN FOR IT TO BE MEANINGFUL AND ROBUST THAT MIGHT SMALL LANGUAGE GROUPS ARE INCLUDED. NANA WRITTEN LANGUAGES ARE INCLUDED. AND ADDRESSING LANGUAGES FOR GEOGRAPHICALLY CONCENTRATED COMMUNITIES. THERE'S ALSO A FEDERAL A A NATIONAL ADVISORY GROUP FOR THE CENSUS WHO HAS. PROVIDED RECOMMENDATIONS NOVEMBER TWENTY SIXTEEN. ON LANGUAGE ACCESS AND THE HARD TO REACH AND WE BELIEVE THAT REPORT HAS MANY KEY ELEMENTS FOR A CALIFORNIA STATE PLAN AND THIRD. OF WE THINK IT'S REALLY CRUCIAL THAT AND CBO INFRASTRUCTURE TO ROLLOUT CENSUS IS IN PLACE SOON. THE ORGANIZATIONS THAT. SERVICE THE HARD TO REACH NEED TO BE ABLE TO RAMP UP BEFORE THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR STARTS. AND THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE COMING SO THEY CAN PLAN EARLY SCALE UP HIRE AND TRAIN THE APPROPRIATE STAFF WHICH ARE ALL SENSES BEST PRACTICES. WE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME. BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ISSUE THREE WILL GO AHEAD IF YOU HAVE COMMENTS ON THAT GOOD INCLUDE THAT NOW. FOR THE OTHER FOLKS YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. US REMEMBER ARTICLE YOU KNOW WHO THE CHALLENGE OF IT WITH A NASA PROJECT CALIFORNIA I'M REPRESENTING. THE SENSES POLICY ADVOCACY NETWORK HERE TODAY. A WE'RE NETWORK OF STATEWIDE ORGANIZATIONS WORKING TOWARDS A FAIR AND ACCURATE CENSUS AND TWENTY TWENTY. UP REPRESENTING MANY HARD TO COUNT ON COMMUNITIES. FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK THIS COMMITTEE FOR AN AUGMENTATION OF FUNDING FOR RECESSES. BUDGET IN THE LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. I AM AND I ALSO WANNA I'M SURE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF GRATITUDE TO THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR INCLUDING A FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL. INDUCED YEAR'S BUDGET. THIS LEADERSHIP IS NEEDED. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA HAS A LOT TO LOSE IN THE POLITICAL CLIMATE ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL. CALIFORNIANS INTENSELY BEING UNDERMINED IN ATTACK AND SENSES TWENTY TWENTY IS AB ONE AVENUE IN WHICH IT'S BEING DONE SO. WE ARE PLEASED TO SEE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HIGH OR HOWEVER WE BELIEVE IT'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING THE STATE SHOULD AND NEED TO INVEST A LOT MORE THAN FORTY POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED. I THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THE NETWORK DID AN ANALYSIS OF JUST HOW MUCH IT WOULD COST CBO TO DO OUTREACH USING VARIOUS METHODS THAT HAVE BEEN USED IN THE PAST AND WILL BE USED AND CENSUS TWENTY TWENTY. AND FOR INSTANCE ARE AT DISNEY'S EXAMPLE JUST LOOKING AT THE LATINO POPULATION ARE NUMBERS EXCEEDED THE TWELVE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL. WE BELIEVE IT'S GONNA ON COST AROUND TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO REACH HARD TO COUNT. OF POPULATIONS TRACTS OF ELECTING A COMMUNITY. AND WE HAVE ABOUT EIGHT TO NINE DIFFERENT HTC POPULATIONS. THIS IS NOT EVEN OUR INCLUDING THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE CITIZENSHIP QUESTION. HAVING SAID THAT WE'RE NOT PROPOSING A HARD BUDGET ASK TODAY BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH YOU AND THE LEADERSHIP AND ADMINISTRATION. AND ADMINISTRATION IN LANDING A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH AND AMOUNT OF FOR THIS EFFORT. AND WE WANT TO PROVIDE ANALYSIS FOR YOU TO DO THAT. IT IS FAR FAR TOO IMPORTANT TO COUNT FOR CALIFORNIA TO UNDERMINE THE BUDGET FOR CENSUS. UNDERWRITING CENSUS FUNDING WILL MEAN UNDERMINING CALIFORNIA SOMETHING WE CANNOT AFFORD TO DO YOU. IT IS NOT JUST WHAT WE WANT IT IS WHAT IS NECESSARY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND WITH THE QUIRK TO WORKING WITH YOU. LET ME SAY THIS ITS BUDGET STUFF APPEARS WORK ON THIS. FOR A LONG TIME WE'RE GOING THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE AND BUDGET CHAIR. TING. FORTY MILLION AS A STARTING POINT IS FAR INSUFFICIENT TO FUND THIS. SO SO CASEY ME TO WELL AGREEMENT. THE LONG HEARING SO BREVITY WOULD BE MUCH APPRECIATED PLEASE. AND EVEN IF IT IS AN ACTIVE AS JUSTICE CALIFORNIA ALSO PART OF ITS IS POLICY OUTFIT I WORK.

CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALEJO ANOTHER BAND REPRESENTING NEXT AND CALIFORNIANS DRUNK SUPPORT. THAT YOU. THE RECRIMINATIONS ALL THIS ITEM OPEN WE HOLD IT OPEN. AND IF AND SO WE KIND OF COVERED ITEM THREE. THAT RICH LANGUAGE ACCESS. SO I'VE OF TO FROM THE FOLKS THAT TESTIFIED EARLIER PUBLIC COMMENT I. TOLD THE GOOD INCLUDE THAT. DID YOU. I JUST TO AND MY APOLOGIES ITS ONE OF THOSE AFTERNOONS BUT. I I UNDERSTAND THERE'S ALREADY BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ON WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN IS TO DEVELOP A LANGUAGE ACCESS PROGRAM. OF I CAN I CAN TALK FURTHER ABOUT IF YOU ACTUALLY IF YOU WANT MY JUST A QUICK SUMMARY ABSOLUTELY SURE. THE LANGUAGE ACCESS COORDINATOR POSITION HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AND WE WILL BE WILL BE HIRED TO ASSIST WITH LANGUAGE. SUPPORT SO POSITION WILL ALSO BE MONITORING. AND AUDITING AND THE LANGUAGE ACTS ACCORDING TO PARTICIPATE ON THE LANGUAGE TEACHER VISION AS I WAS ACCESS IS CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT OF THIS CAMPAIGN SO AS PART OF THE GROUND STRATEGY THE SCOOBIES ORGANIZATIONS. WILL HAVE CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS ADDRESSING THEIR LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL COMPETENCIES THAT WILL BE DEPLOYED AT THE GROUND LEVEL SO. WE'LL HAVE ONE PERSON TO DO THAT'S ALSO WORK ON THE REPORT FOR IS A ITEM THREE. BUT ALSO WITH IN OUR. RESTORE OUTREACH MANAGERS THEY ALL WILL HAVE THAT HOT AS WELL SO IT LIKE AN OFFICIAL COORDINATOR AND THEN ACROSS ALL CONTRACTING. WITH COMMITTEES ORGANIZATIONS ON AND ALSO WITH THE COUNTIES. WILL BE A LANGUAGE ACCESS OPPONENTS OF WHICH THEY NEED TO. LOAD UP IN THEIR PLAN BEFORE THEY DO. ANY STATE DOLLARS AND OUR EYES ARE ARE YOU GOING TO BE PUTTING OUT A MORE DETAILED PLAN ON US CAN WE EXPECT TO. HAVE MORE INFORMATION THAT THE PUBLIC WILL BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. PLEASE YES OKAY HAVE THE EARTHY WEED OUT REACHING CREATION STRATEGY IS ON THE FIRST DRAFT IS WHEN WE COMPLETE CONVENIENCE. WILL BE. DUE OCTOBER FIRST GREATNESS INCOMPLETE COUNT WELL IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT THAT IVAN. SIGNIFICANT INTEREST IN THIS SITE GIVEN THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO. LANGUAGE ACCESS AND I THINK ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE AS FULLY FLESHED OUT AND AS COMPREHENSIVE A PLAN AS POSSIBLE WE WOULD APPRECIATE. AND THEN THE SECOND QUESTION. IS AROUND CENSUS OUTREACH. OBVIOUSLY WE APPRECIATE WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS INITIALLY PROPOSED FOR CENSUS BUT I THINK THERE IS. CERTAINLY SENSURROUND STATE THAT WE NEED TO DEVELOP MORE FUNDING TO CENSUS OUT REACH PARTICULARLY GIVEN WHAT THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS SUGGESTED MY GUESS IS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS A BIT BUT. OUT WHAT SORT OF PLAN AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE AROUND CENSUS OUT REACH. WELL WELCOME TO THE BUDGET. DOING BOTH AN AIR GAME AND A ON GAME IN THE GROUND RAIN OF COURSE IS THE ADMINISTRATIVE OF AND THE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. THE AIR GAME IS REALLY TO PROVIDE THAT SURROUND SOUND IT'S CHANGED A LOT IN TERMS OF MEDIA ADVERTISING SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN ALONE. USING SOCIAL MEDIA AND USING A LOT OFTHE OTHER DIGITAL ADVERTISING THEIR MORE MIKE RETARDED BUT WE ALSO HAVE SCHOOL OUTREACH THAT WE'RE DOING BECAUSE OF COURSE YOU KNOW THAT. STUDENTS CAN BE PARTICULARLY IN LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT HOUSEHOLDS CAN BE REALLY KEY MESSENGERS AND THAT SOMETIMES THEY ACTUALLY END UP FILLING OUT THOSE FORMS. ALSO HAVE CASEWORKER OUTREACH WHICH IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TEN WE WORK WITH THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN'S PROGRAMS SCOTT OF JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF WORKING WITH LOCALITIES IN IDENTIFYING. A CASE WORKER SPECIFIC. BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE SERVE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE HARDEST ACCOUNT AND THEY HAVE TIME WITH THEM AND IN PARTICULAR THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN PROGRAM THEY HAVE. YOU KNOW TEN TO TWENTY MINUTES EACH MONTH WHERE THEY MEET WITH THESE YOUNG MOTHERS AND EDUCATE THEM ABOUT NUTRITION BUT WE CAN ALSO WE'VE USED IN THE PAST DECENNIAL CENSUS TO WHERE THEY CAN EDUCATE THEM ABOUT. HOW TO FILL OUT THE FORM AND WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT? WE ALSO HAVE A COUPLE OTHER COMPONENTS SECTOR OUTREACH AND. OUR STATE AGENCY WORKING GROUP WHICH WE DIDN'T BOTH TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THOUSAND TEN BECAUSE MANY OF OUR STATE AGENCIES THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE A D. M. V.. SOME OF THE SOCIAL SERVICES THEY ARE RIGHT THERE ON THE GROUND LEVEL IN TERMS OF SERVICE PROVISION THEY MAY NOT BE EXACTLY THE MOST TRUSTED MESSENGERS AND MAYBE THINK THAT COMMUNITIES ORGANIZATIONS ARE. BUT THEY CAN ALSO PROVIDE THAT SURROUND SOUND ABOUT WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT AND WHY SERVICES CAN BE IMPACTED IF THEY'RE NOT COUNTY. I'LL JUST MAKE THE COMMENT THAT. AGAIN WHY PRE SHEET WHAT IS FROM PROPOSED THUS FAR I THINK WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO BEFORE I AM GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH MONEY INVESTED. TO ADEQUATELY ENSURE THAT WE'RE COUNTING EVERYBODY. PARTICULAR WHEN IT COMES TO TO SUCH AS OUR REGION AND I'M ALSO THE PERSPECTIVE THAT IT IS. FOLKS ON THE GROUND WHO CAN HELP US AS A STATE DO THE BEST JOB OF COUNTING EVERYONE SO. TO THE CHAIR INTO OUR COLLEAGUE SO YOU KNOW I CERTAINLY HOPE IN THE COMING. WEEKS WE'LL BE ABLE TO HAVE MORE OF A CONVERSATION OF WHAT THAT ADEQUATE AMOUNT IS I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION AMONG DIVERSE STAKEHOLDERS OUTSIDE THIS BUILDING BUT ALSO. BETWEEN ADMINISTRATION AND OUR. ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON THE CENSUS THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND OTHERS AND I HOPE THAT IN THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS WE CAN ALL GET ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT LOOKS LIKE. SELECT. GREAT THANKS KNOWING FULL EMPLOYMENT WHICH IS COMMON THE TOUGH PART IS. YOU HAVE HALF THE STAFF YOU HAD IN THE LAST CENSUS. AND WHO CLIMATE TODAY IN WASHINGTON FOLKS BEING. I MEAN GENERALLY SCARED. TO REPORT. THAT THAT THAT THAT'S A FOUR STRINGPARTS THE STATE BECAUSE AGENCIES THAT NEED. AND SHOULD ASK FOR MONEY. AUGMENTATIONS DON'T BECAUSE THEY'RE TOLD BY THE BOSSES. TWO THOUSAND AND THE STATE. AND THAT IS B. S.. THAT IS BE F. HAVING HALF THE STAFF THEY HAVE YOUR HURLEY WAS CHU BUT THEY HAVE TWENTY TWO STAFF. AND PRIOR THAT FIFTY FIVE. I'M THAT IDEA I'M GLAD YOU MENTIONED IT I'LL REITERATE THE BEST PART OF WHAT YOU JUST SAID THANK YOU HIGH MID BROTHER. ENOUGH THAT THE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE WE'RE TOUGH TIME THIS IS MONEY CALIFORNIA. THAT IF WE DON'T GET THE CORRECT SINCE HIS WE LOSE WE ALL LOSE SO IT'S LIKE I I'M ALL FOR GIVEN. IT MAKES THIS IS YOU NEED TO GET A ADEQUATE CAL. THAT'S WE JUST THE FRUSTRATING PART WITH WITH. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THAT IS FRUSTRATING. FIND AT IF WE IF WE CAN GET THE BEST COUNT WE CAN THAT'S. I I JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT NON OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T HAVE A FORMER HERE SO WE CAN VOTE ON THIS I THINK THERE'S A RISK RESPONSE FROM OUR LEFT. YET. YOU. BROADLY SPEAKING IN REGARDS THE CENSUS ITEM JUST WANTED TO MENTION THAT THE FUNDING AND THE POSITION COUNT IT'S INCLUDED IN THIS REQUEST. COMBINED WITH FEES CONTRACTED. COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION RESOURCES THAT WOULD BE USED THEY DO REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE. WE DO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY GIVEN THIS EFFORT. WE DO OF COURSE ACKNOWLEDGE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS TO CALIFORNIA AND ITS BROADER IMPACTS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AND STAKEHOLDERS REGARDING THE CENSUS THANK YOU I THINK. MAYBE MAYBE ONE THEY'LL JUST SAY AN ADDITIONAL AT THE CHAIR JUST SAID I THINK WE ALL APPRECIATE THE IMPORTANCE OF THE CENSUS AND I DO THINK THE FIRST AMOUNT THAT WAS SUGGESTED IN THE AND THE JEW IN THE JANUARY BUDGET. WAS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE'RE IN A DIFFERENT WORLD RIGHT NOW NONE OF US EXPECTED THAT THAT. CITIZENSHIP QUESTION WOULD ACTUALLY BECOME PART OF THIS. AND WHETHER THE RIGHT ANSWER TO HOW WHAT WE SPEND ON THE BUDGET IS. DOUBLE WHAT WE HAVE FOUR FIVE TIMES WHAT WE HAVE I THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING IN TERMS OF A ORDER OF MAGNITUDE. UP BECAUSE IF WE GET THIS WRONG I THINK WE ALL KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES OF WHAT THAT'S GOING TO MEAN FOR US FOR. A DECADE IF NOT MORE SO. I WILL CERTAINLY BE OPEN TO SUPPORTING A MUCH SIGNIFICANT AUGMENTATION ANDERSON AND CERTAINLY TO THE BUDGET STAFF AND AND LEADERSHIP AS WE THINK ABOUT IT I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT WE PUT UP A MUCH BIGGER NUMBER. WITH A REAL PORTION OF THAT GOING TO REACH. BUT YOU. SOMEONE ISSUE NUMBER FOUR. PRECISION MEDICINE. GOOD AFTERNOON SCOTT MORGAN WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE PLAYING IN RESEARCH. SITTING IN FOR DOCTOR ELIZABETH BAKA. DOES LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR PRODUCES MEDICINE.

A SOME QUESTIONS HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT THE NEED TO CHANGE THE PROGRAM. FROM. STATEMENT INITIATIVE TO A A NONPROFIT. INSTITUTE. NOW WE BELIEVE THAT THE NONPROFIT. IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT CAN CREATE A. A BECAUSE THE CREATION OF THE INSTITUTE ALLOWS. FOR. OF AND MORE. STREAMLINED AND UP TO BETTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR DONATIONS OF FUNDS FROM A PRIVATE ENTITIES IN INDUSTRY AND FUNDERS. AYE IN KIND SUPPORT ANOTHER REVENUE. THAT MAYBE AND I'M A AVAILABLE AYE IT FROM THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR MORE COLLABORATIVE I'M. SPACE IF YOU WILL. ACROSS BLUNDERS UNIVERSITIES AND MEDICINE MEDICAL RESEARCH INSTITUTES.

THE STATE'S ADDITIONAL OF INVESTMENT HAS SPURRED UNIQUE COLLABORATIONS BETWEEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AYE DAMIEN NONPROFIT AND PRIVATE SECTORS. IN TUNING TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY FIELD OF PRECISION MEDICINE THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE TO ADVANCE PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE WILL BE VITAL TO MAKING IMPORTANT VANCE'S TO. IMPROVE BASED ON MY LIMITED EXPERIENCE IN THE MEDICAL. FINANCE. RECORD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BUT. ESTABLISHING THE CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE TO ADVANCE PRECISION HEALTH AND MEDICINE WILL REALLY HELP TO INTEGRATE SUCCESSFUL COME FINDINGS FROM THE EXISTING DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AND PRECISION MEDICINE INTO THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM. THE INSTITUTE WILL REALLY MOVED BEYOND THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT WE FUNDED TODATE. AND WORK TOWARDS TRANSLATING THEM AND BRING THEM INTO HEALTH CARE DELIVERY.

SYSTEM ENCOMPASSES ACCOUNTING BUDGETING CASH MANAGEMENT PROCUREMENT IN BANKING. I AND TO KEEP IMPLEMENTATION WE ARE BASICALLY HAVING. A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR DEPARTMENTS CHANGE THE WAY THAT THEY DO BUSINESS. AND ELIMINATE SOMETHING CLOSE TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED LEGACY EITHER MAINFRAMES OR SPREADSHEETS OR OR THE WAY THAT DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN DOING ACCOUNTING PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A CENTRALIZED SYSTEM. WHEN IT IS COMPLETED A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. MORE THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY STATE ENTITIES AND TWENTY THOUSAND STATE EMPLOYEES WILL BE UTILIZING THE FISCAL SYSTEM. WHICH MEANS THAT THE BUSINESS FOR THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD WILL FINALLY BE AND WINE AND TO AND SYSTEM. SO CURRENTLY THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN. DEPLOYED TO EIGHTY EIGHT DEPARTMENTS THAT UTILIZE IT FOR ACCOUNTING. WE HAVE SINCE JULY TWENTY SIXTEEN. VIZQUEL IS THE SYSTEM FOR A COUNTY DEPARTMENT ACCOUNTING PROCUREMENT AND BUDGET FUNCTIONALITY. THE PAST THREE GOVERNOR'S BUDGETS HAVE BEEN PRODUCED UTILIZING AND THE INFORMATION THAT HAS BEEN. DONE INST IMPORTED INTO FISTS CAO. INCLUDING STARTING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAS BEEN ABLE TO PRODUCE THE ENACTED BUDGET AND PROVIDE THAT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO THE PEOPLE WITH THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL. THAT BE INTRODUCED BUDGET IS SO AGAIN THE MOST. RELEVANT AND AND CRITICAL BUDGETING DOCUMENT NOW IS AT THE ACTUALLY ENACTED LEVEL. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. SO FAR WITH THE DEPARTMENT OFFICE GAO. THE REMAINING FUNCTION SO IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE WILL BE BRINGING ON IN JULY ANOTHER APPROXIMATELY SIXTY FOUR DEPARTMENTS. AND WE ADOPTED V. S. P. R. NUMBER SEVEN WHICH OUTLINES THE STEPS IN TIMELINE FOR THE FINAL PHASE OF THE IMPLEMENTATION.

TO BE DONE IN THESE FIVE MILESTONES AND WE ARE CURRENTLY IN ON SPRINT. IN THE SPRINT PERIOD TEN OF TWENTY NINE SO WE ARE MAKING SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS. BY CHANGING THE WAY IN THE METHODOLOGY IN THE APPROACH THAT WE ARE UTILIZING TO ON BOARD. THEN THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE WE EXPECT THAT WE WILL HAVE A REDUCED RISK TO BOTH. AND TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS THEY DO THE BOOK OF RECORD AND SO. THIS WAS AN IMPORTANT AND PRUDENT DECISION TO CHANGE THE IMPLEMENTATION TO ALLOW FOR A MORE PHASED APPROACH. BUT YOU. FINANCE. NEITHER ARE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PURE SUPPORTER OF THE AUGMENTATION OF THIS PATROL WAS BUDGET TO BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT THE. TRANSITION FROM A LEGACY SYSTEM TO THE FISCAL BOOK OF RECORD.
