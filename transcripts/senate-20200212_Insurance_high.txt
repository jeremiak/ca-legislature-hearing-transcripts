SO THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR JOINING JOINING US HERE TODAY- THIS HEARING ON WILDFIRES IN HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE WILL FOCUS ON AVAILABILITY AND HIGH RISK COMMUNITIES LAST MAY THIS COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING COVERING THE AFFORDABILITY AND AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE IN THESE HIGH RISK AREAS. THE INFORMATION PRESENTED AT THE HEARING SUGGESTED SOME AREAS WERE SUFFERING FROM NON RENEWALS BUT THE INSURANCE FOR PICKING UP SOME OF THE CONSUMER SINCE THAT HEARING THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE RECENT UPDATE A REPORT. ON THE NUMBER OF NON RENEWALS AND MEALS THROUGH THE END OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN ALTHOUGH THERE WERE SOME INCREASE ON FROM THE PRIOR YEAR OF THESE NUMBERS AND NOT SHOW ANY SAID SHIFT OR SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO THE MARKET. HOWEVER THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN TRACKING UP TO DATE AND WOMAN FROM THE FAIR PLAN. THE SEARCH ENROLLMENT SUGGEST A MORE ALARMING TREND. POLICY HOLDERS FOR NON RENEWED APPEAR TO BE UNABLE TO FIND REPLACEMENT COVERAGE AND SOME CONSUMERS MAY NOT FIND COVERAGE AT ALL. LAST YEAR THE SENATE PRO TEM. ESTABLISHED IN ENERGY INSURANCE STABILITY WORKING GROUP TO STUDY POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS FOR STABILIZING THE MARKET. MEMBERS OF THE WORKING GROUP ALL AGREED THAT AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY IS OF THE UTMOST IMPORTANCE AND CONCERN. THE COMMITTEE PLANS TO HAVE ANOTHER HEARING THAT FOCUSES SOLELY ON AFFORDABILITY. AND THE FAIR PLAN AS SOON AS NEXT MONTH. THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING ALONE IS AVAILABILITY AVAILABILITY AND WE WILL SPECIFICALLY FOCUS ON STRATEGIES FOR ADDRESSING THE NON RENEWALS. A FEW SOLUTIONS HAVE BEEN OFFERED BUT OFTEN ABOUT POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND NEGATIVE. CONSEQUENCES IN ADDRESSING THIS PROBLEM IT CAN BE REALLY TRICKY SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. REALLY MINDFUL THAT WE DON'T WANT UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND CONSUMER SUFFERING FOR THE CONSEQUENCES. THE PURPOSE OF THIS HEARING TODAY IS TO CONSIDER AND EVALUATE ALL THE FACTORS INVOLVING.

SO CAN THANK YOU FOR GIVING US THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY I WAS ASKED BY COMMITTEE STAFF TO BRIEFLY UPDATE YOU ON THE CHALLENGES BEING FACED BY CONSUMERS IN THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET IN ADDITION TO THE DEPARTMENTS AND THE INITIAL. I LEVEL FOUGHT. ON HOW TO IMPROVE CONSUMER ACCESS TO INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. INCLUDING ESPECIALLY IN THE MOVIE THE WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE REGIONS OF OUR STATE. BEFORE BEGIN HOWEVER I ALSO WANTED TO I'D BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THE SENATE DEMOCRATIC CAUCUS AUCTION. ACTION PLAN JUST PUBLICLY UNVEILED THIS MORNING I DID WANT TO SAY THAT COMMISSIONER LANA IS VERY EXCITED. BY THIS PLAN AND LOOKS FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH YOU. CHAIR RUBIO AND SENATE PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS PLUS ALL ON THIS CRITICAL ISSUE. OF INSURANCE AVAILABILITY FOR HOMEOWNERS AND FINDING A SOLUTION TO ADDRESS INCREASING ON RENEWALS IN EVERY AREA OF OUR STATE IN ADDITION TO ENGAGING ON OTHER OF THE PLAN ELEMENT. LEADERSHIP IN TAKING AMBITIOUS STEPS TO ADDRESS INSURANCE NON RENEWALS EXPAND ACCESS TO HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE. KEEP INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE ENGAGE OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES AND PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES ARE ALL VERY IMPORTANT GOALS TO COMMISSIONER LOT AS WELL. IN THE DEPARTMENT ANDERSON LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNERING WITH ALL OF YOU. ON SOLUTIONS THAT KEEP CALIFORNIANS SAY FROM THE DOUBLE THREATS OF WILDFIRES AND CLIMATE CHANGE OR WANTED TO. HELP THAT GIVEN THAT WAS JUST FOR RECENT NEWS FROM THIS MORNING. SO TODAY THERE ARE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS AS WE KNOW WHO ARE DEALING WITH AN INSURANCE CRISIS MANY ARE FACING ABRUPT. SUBSTANTIAL INCREASES IN INSURANCE PREMIUMS ALL OTHERS CANNOT FIND IT IN MENTORED ENSURE THAT WILL RIGHT THERE ARE COVERAGE. FOR THOSE THAT CANNOT FIND IN COVERAGE THERE IS ONLY THE FAIR PLAN THE INSURER OF LAST RESORT. WHICH INCLUDES NO COVERAGE FOR WATER DAMAGE NO COVERAGE FOR LIABILITY AND NO COVERAGE FOR INCIDENTAL WORKERS COMPENSATION EXPOSURES. WE HAVE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM MANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS PLEASE KNOW THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS RECEIVED. DOUBLE THE CONSUMER COMPLAINTS ABOUT NON RENEWALS IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. FROM CONSUMERS LOCATED. ZIP CODES DESIGNATED BY CAL FIRE AS HAVING THE GREATEST RISK OF WILDFIRE. COMMISSIONER LOT OF HAS ALSO BEEN HOLDING TOWN HALLS ROUND TABLES AND WORKSHOPS WITH HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS OWNERS LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND STATE LEGISLATORS INCLUDING SEVERAL OF YOU AND YOUR COLLEAGUES HERE IN THE STATE SENATE. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN FACT SINCE LAST SPRING COMMISSIONER LARA AND DEPARTMENT STAFF HAD MET WITH THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS UP AND DOWN ACROSS THE STATE. AT TWENTY TOWN HALLS AND SEVENTEEN COUNTIES AND HOW TWENTY SIX MORE TOWN HALLS AND MANY OTHER COUNTIES PLANNED- THIS NEXT TOWN FOR MONTHS AGAIN WITH SEVERAL OF YOU. HAVE I WOULD SAY IF YOU HAVEN'T HAD OR HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. THE TOWN HALL IN YOUR DISTRICT WITH COMMISSIONER LOT OF PLEASE DO. LET ME KNOW AND WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY AND WILLING TO. I ALSO HAVE MY STAFF HAVE A HELL OF A MAN SHOULD BE REACHING TO YOUR DISTRICT OFFICE STAFF. TO SET ONE UP ONE UP IF ONE HASN'T BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO ENSURE THAT- CERTAINLY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. HAVE THAT TO HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. THE CLEAR INDICATIONS FOR TOWN HALLS ARE SOBERING. AND I MEAN I MEAN YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SHARING IT IT'S JUST THOUGHT SENIORS LIVING ON FIXED INCOMES TRYING TO GET BY THE PREMIUM INCREASES MAKING IT VERY HARD. THE IMPACT HOME VALUES TAX REVENUES I MEAN WE'RE HEARING ALL OF THIS HOMES FALLING OUT OF ESCROW. BECAUSE PROSPECTIVE HOME BUYERS ARE FINDING INSURANCE COVERAGE TO BE COST PROHIBITIVE. AND WE'RE HEARING ALL OF THIS OUT THESE TOWN HALLS AND WE CONTINUE TO AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT- THAT I'M SURE ALL OF YOU HAVE AS WELL SO FOR THESE HOMEOWNERS THE- UPSHIFT INSURANCE OF THE- AVAILABILITY IS THE MAJOR FINANCIAL DILEMMA. AND THERE CONTINUES TO BE VERY HARD AND DIFFICULT CLEAR PATHWAY OUT. SO WHAT ARE SOME COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTIONS. HELP IMPROVE ACCESS TO THE STATE'S INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. FIRST OF ALL WE PRESS THE PAUSE BUTTON. AS YOU KNOW SB SENATE BILL EIGHT TWENTY FOUR THAT WAS AUTHORED BY THEN SENATOR RICARDO LARA THOSE CHAPTER IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WAS IMPLEMENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME LAST DECEMBER. BY THE DEPARTMENT IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ADMINISTRATION SPECIFICALLY CALLOW YES AND CAL FIRE AND IS CURRENTLY PROTECTING OVER ONE MILLION HOMEOWNERS. INTO ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THE CODES ACROSS THE STATE FROM NON RENEWAL FOR AN ENTIRE YEAR. MISTER LOTT HAS ALSO ASKED INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO VOLUNTARILY EXTEND THIS PROTECTION TO HAUL ALL HOMEOWNERS STATEWIDE WELL WE ALL COLLECTIVELY WORK TOGETHER ON HOW BEST TO MOVE FORWARD. OBVIOUSLY AS WE ALL KNOW THIS WHEN YOU'RE FIX IS REALLY IT'S A PAUSE IT'S A POSITIVE TEMPORARY FIX NOT A PERMANENT SOLUTION AND THE GOAL HERE WAS INTENDED TO WE BELIEVE CALM THE MARKET TO ALLOW TIME FOR THE GOVERNOR. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND DEPARTMENT LEGISLATORS CONSUMERS INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITIES TO DEVELOP LASTING SOLUTIONS AT LEAST SO WE DO HAVE THIS TEMPORARY- AGAIN POSSIBLE IN BUTTON IN PLACE. SECOND INSURANCE RATES HAVE BEEN INCREASING IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN OUR STATE. THE DEPARTMENT HAS APPROVED TWO HUNDRED AND TEN. HOMEOWNERS RATE INCREASES FROM TWO THOUSAND SIX TO TWENTY NINETEEN. WITH MORE ON THE HORIZON. THAT MEANS MANY INSURERS HAVE ALREADY BEEN INTO THE DEPARTMENT SEEKING MULTIPLE RATE INCREASES. AND IT WILL BE TO THAT JUST. A IT'S A IT'S A pTHAT THAT WE HAVE HAD AGAIN THESE MULTIPLE RATE INCREASES INTO THE DEPARTMENT. AND WE BELIEVE CONTRAST TO SOME SUGGESTIONS MADE BY SOME IN THE INDUSTRY THAT THE DEPARTMENT. HAS NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY APPROVING RATE INCREASES MADE BY INSURERS. WHEN ENSURE CAN TAKE CLEARLY DEMONSTRATE THAT A FILED RATES. IS NOT EXCESSIVE. IN ADEQUATE UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY THE DEPARTMENT HAS APPROVED THE INCREASE. UNFORTUNATELY THIS ALREADY MEANT AND DOES MAIN DOUBLE DIGIT AND EVEN TRIPLE DIGIT INCREASES FROM ANY POLICY HOLDERS AND HIGH RISK LOCATIONS. I WANTED ALSO GIVEN THAT THE HEARING SUBSEQUENT PANEL- WOULD BE TALKING ABOUT REINSURANCE INVOLVED FOR WRIST MODELS I DID WANNA SEE ALSO COUPLE ITEMS A COUPLE REMARKS ON THOSE TWO ITEMS. DATA INSURERS ARE PREVIOUSLY ARGUED AGAINST THE DEPARTMENT'S REFUSAL TO ALLOW THEIR COSTS FOR INSURANCE TO BE INCLUDED IN AND INSURERS RATES ASSESSMENT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH DIRECTLY ADDING REINSURANCE COSTS TO RAISING INCLUDING ALLOWING HOLE UNREGULATED MARKET DRIVEN RATES INTO THE PRIOR APPROVAL PROCESS CAN UNDERMINE RATE REGULATION PROP ONE OF THREE IS MANDATED PRIOR APPROVAL OF TRANSPARENT RATES. AS WELL AS UNDERMINE OUR CONSUMER PROTECTIONS FROM EXCESSIVE RATES WE DO FEEL THAT RE INSURANCE COVERAGE IS NOT A STANDARDIZED LONG ANSWERS AND CAN ACTUALLY COVER AN ENTIRE STATE OR MULTIPLE STATES AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO BE ABLE TO REALLY DETERMINE OKAY WHAT'S FOR CALIFORNIA WHAT'S IN THIS PARTICULAR WILL BE WHAT'S THE COST FOR INSURANCE IN SPECIFICS PARTS OF THE STATE VERSUS THIS BROAD SWATH. THAT CAN BE TAKEN. THUS WE BELIEVE COMPLICATING EFFORTS TO OVERSEE THE TRUE ACTUAL COST INVOLVED FOR STATES AS DIVERSE AND VARIED AS AS CALIFORNIA. INSURERS WOULD ALSO LIKE TO USE CATASTROPHIC CATASTROPHE RISK MODELS AND THE RATE MAKING PROCESS TO PROTECT THEIR CATASTROPHE LOSSES FOR THE COMING POLICY PERIOD RATHER THAN THE CURRENTLY USE. CAT LOADS. OUR MODELS ARE GENERALLY PROPRIETARY PRODUCTS LACKING ANY TRANSPARENCY TO THE CONSUMER PUBLIC LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REGULATE TORE. AND THE PREDICTIVE ABILITY HAS LIMITATIONS AND AS THE COMEDIAN ALICE'S INDICATED STILL IN ITS EARLY ADOLESCENCE. SOLELY ALLOWING INSURERS TO CHARGE EVEN MORE FOR INSURANCE IS NOT GOING TO MAKE THE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. A SOLELY BETTER. ESPECIALLY SINCE NO INSURERS TO THE DEPARTMENTS KNOWLEDGE TO DATE. HAVE GUARANTEED THEY WOULD KEEP OR INCREASE THEIR HIGHER WILD FIRE EXPOSURE BUSINESS ESPECIALLY WHEN IN THE MOVIE. EVEN IF THEY COULD INCLUDE THE REINSURANCE COSTS ENTIRELY AND RISK MODEL PROJECTIONS AND THE RATES. SO THAT THAT IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION THAT THE DEPARTMENT BELIEVES. SHOULD BE A CONSIDERED AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS POLICY DISCUSSION. PLEASE KNOW THAT WE ARE NOT BEYOND. CONSIDERING OPTIONS OKAY I MEAN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S PART OF THE AS THIS POLICY THE DISCUSSION MOVES FORWARD BUT I DO WANT TO SAY THAT AS WITH ALL POLICY DEBATES ON ALL ISSUES SHOULD BE ON THE TABLE. AND HOW ARE WE DO ARGUE THAT CONSISTENCY TRANSPARENCY FAIRNESS AND REGULATOR OVERSIGHT SHOULD BE TANTAMOUNT TO CONSUMERS AND POLICYMAKERS. BACK TO THE CONFERENCE OF SOLUTIONS. BUT I DO WANT TO JUST DO THAT PLAGUE OF. THIRD THE DEPARTMENT PLEASE WE NEED TO MODERNIZE THE INSURANCE SAFETY NET KNOWN AS THE FAIR PLAN ARE CALIFORNIA'S INSURER OF LAST RESORT. SO AS MANY PEOPLE KNOW THE FAIR PLAN IS BECOMING THE ONLY OPTION FOR HOMEOWNERS BECAUSE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL NOT WRITE. THEM A POLICY AGAIN SPECIAL IN THE MOVIE BECAUSE WE KNOW A COMMISSIONER LOT ON A NOVEMBER FOURTEENTH TWENTY NINETEEN HE ORDERED THE FAIR PLAN TO OFFER COMPREHENSIVE INSURANCE POLICY OPTION TO IN ADDITION TO ITS FIRE ONLY POLICY. INCREASED ITS COVERS ON THAT ALLOW PAYMENTS BY CREDIT CARD IN MONTHLY. WE BELIEVE EVERY INSURANCE COMPANY DOES CURRENTLY OFFER TODAY. AND THE FAIR PLAN IS OBJECTING TO THIS PROPOSED ORDER AND IS CURRENTLY WE THE DEPARTMENT ISN'T PENDING LITIGATION ON THIS ISSUE- BUT ALL THAT BEING SAID WE DO BELIEVE THE CHANGES ARE LONG OVERDUE FOR CONSUMERS. LASTLY LEASE FOR TODAY FOR THE CONVERSATION. CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. A CLEAR PATH TO INSURANCE COVER COVERAGE AND WE BELIEVE THIS CAN BE CONSIDERED AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN THREE WAYS. FIRST THE STATE NEEDS A CLEAR CONSISTENT STATEWIDE MITIGATION STANDARD TO FOCUS THE EFFORTS OF HOMEOWNERS AND COMMUNITIES TOWARDS HAVING. AND MAINTAINING HEART AND EXISTING HOMES. AND HEART AND COMMUNITIES SECONDLY A STRUCTURAL SYSTEM FOR VERIFYING WHO MEETS THE STANDARDS SO SOMEONE ACTUALLY TO VERIFY IS THIS HOME IS THIS COMMITTEE MEETING THAT STANDARD. THIRDLY A AN INCENTIVE AN AMPLE TIME FOR HOMEOWNERS IN COMMUNITIES TO MEET THE STANDARD. ALL OF THAT WRAPPED IN WHICH WE BELIEVE WOULD HELP AND ENSURE AND HOMEOWNERS MEETING A CLEAR COMMITMENT BY INSURERS TO WRITE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR HOMES THAT MEET THE STANDARD. AND WE BELIEVE US PROVIDING STRONG INCENTIVE TO REDUCE WILD FIRE RISK BECAUSE AGAIN I UNDERSCORE INCREASING RATES WHICH AGAIN IS BY AND LARGE BEING DONE AT THE DEPARTMENT- IN ITS CURRENT PROCESS AND NON RENEWING POLICY HOLDERS WHICH UNFORTUNATELY IS HAPPENING IN HIGH RISK AREAS. OF THE STATE CANNOT BE THE ONLY ANSWER. AND WE'VE SEEN SIMILAR ELEMENTS SUCH AS THIS BEFORE. IT HAS BEEN RECOMMENDED TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO THE DEPARTMENT TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE WRISTS WE'VE SEEN FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE WHICH TREE METALLIC TASK FORCE WHICH MANY OF US HAVE BEEN INVOLVED WITH WHICH CREATED WILD FIRE MITIGATION TEARS FOR HOMES IN THE WE SAW LAST YEAR THE SENATE BILL. NINE A ONE COMMISSION WHICH RECOMMENDED ESTABLISHING HOME BUYER RISK REDUCTION AND COMMUNITY REST A REDUCTION STANDARDS WITH INPUT FROM INSURERS AND STAKEHOLDERS THAT WOULD REQUIRE INSURERS TO WRITE INSURANCE FOR HOMEOWNER AND COMMUNITY BOTH MEET STANDARDS. AND THEN WE SAW LAST YEAR WITH THE LEGISLATURE PASSING A. B. THIRTY EIGHT WHICH CREATED THE STATE WIDE- FINANCIAL MECHANISM FOR FUNDING HOME ARD IN. THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED LAST YEAR SENATE BILL ONE NINE ZERO BY SENATOR DODD WHICH DIRECTED THE FIRE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO DEVELOP A MODEL DEFENSIBLE SPACE LAW FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND THEN- GOVERNOR PROPOSING IN THIS BUDGET A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR. HOME HARDENING. WHICH THE COMMISSIONERS. AS WELL AS CONTINUED BUDGET- OF FUNDING FOR. AND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES FOR PRE WILDFIRE FORCE MANAGEMENT AND WILD FIRE RESPONSE TO. JUST BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT THAT BACKDROP OF IMPORTANT. ISSUES AND POLICY- AND BUDGET RECOMMENDATIONS AND AS WELL AS THROUGH ENACTED IN CHAPTER. BILLS AND BUDGET PROPOSALS THAT HAVE- MOVE FORWARD TO LATER IN PART IN GROUNDWORK FOR THE POLICY- WORK IN THIS AREA. AND SO I CLOSE WITH JUST SAYING THAT. AS A SAID BEFORE AND THE OPENING. IS AT COMMISSIONER LADA AND THE DEPARTMENT WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO PARTNER AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS YEAR. REALLY THERE IS A LOT OF A LOT OF POTENTIAL FOR THIS YEAR TO COME TOGETHER. AND FIND MEANINGFUL AND LASTING SOLUTIONS FOR THE INSURANCE MARKET PLACE. AS WELL AS INSURING CONSUMERS ARE PROTECTED AND HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE INSURANCE. THANK YOU. WE OFFER QUESTIONS UNTIL WE'RE DONE WITH THE PANEL YOU MAY PROCEED. I'M SHARON MEMBERS MY NAME'S REX FRAZIER AND PRESIDENT THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA. WITH MY COLLEAGUES HERE IN TAYLOR. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND BEFORE I BEGIN PLEASE ALLOW ME TO COMPLIMENT THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR PREPARING SUCH A THOROUGH AND THOUGHTFUL BACKGROUND REPORT. WELL HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IS BROADLY AVAILABLE STATEWIDE THE RESIDENTS OF SEVERAL COUNTIES POSSIBLY UPWARDS OF TEN TO TWELVE. OF THE CALIFORNIA OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES HAVE EXPERIENCED OR CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE ANXIETY OF BEING UNABLE TO OBTAIN A POLICY FROM THE REGULAR OR VOLUNTARY MARKET. BY THIS REFER I REFER TO A FULLY REGULATED INSURANCE COMPANY THAT VOLUNTARILY OFFERS A NEW OR RENEW A POLICY. THE PERCENTAGE OF RESIDENTS IN HIGH RISK AREAS UNABLE TO FIND A VOLUNTARY MARKET SOLUTION REMAINS LOW THAT IS LITTLE COMFORT TEACH RESIDENTS FACING THIS PROBLEM. FOR THOSE UNABLE TO FIND A VOLUNTARY MARKET POLICY THERE ARE TWO TEMPORARY OPTIONS THAT ASSURE AVAILABILITY UNTIL THE MARKET REBOUNDS. THE SURPLUS LINE MARKET IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BACKED CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAYING. THE SURPLUS LINE MARKET WILL ALWAYS BE MORE EXPENSIVE. THEY ON THE REGULAR MARKET IT'S PRICES ARE NOT STATE CONTROLLED BUT SURPLUS LINE INSURERS CAN ENTER THE MARKET QUICKLY WHEN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET INSTRUCTS. THE FAIR PLAN LIKEWISE IS ALWAYS MORE EXPENSIVE THAN THE VOLUNTARY MARKET BECAUSE IT IS A HIGH RISK POOL THAT SUFFERS FROM ADVERSE SELECTION. IT IS ALSO A SMALL OPERATION CANNOT ACHIEVE THE ECONOMY OF SCALE COST SAVINGS THAT THE LARGER VOLUNTARY MARKET. INSURERS ARE ABLE TO DO. IN GENERAL THE COST OF JUST THE FAIR PLANS FIRE ONLY INSURANCE POLICY. WILL BE MORE EXPENSIVE THAN A VOLUNTARY MARKET INSURERS PRICE FOR THE ENTIRE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY. WHICH INCLUDES FIRE BOTH ONE OFTEN CATASTROPHIC FIRE WATER LOSSES LIABILITY CLAIMS LIKE. LIKE A SLIP AND FALL IN FACT. IN NO RESPONSIBLE LONG TERM SOLUTION TO A VOLUNTARY MARKET DISRUPTION WILL RELY UPON EITHER THE NON ADMITTED MARKET OR THE FAIR PLAN. A LONG TERM SOLUTION FOR HIGH RISK AREAS MUST INVOLVE RESTORATION OF THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. WHICH REQUIRES A THOUGHTFUL BALANCING OF UNDERWRITING RATING AND CLAIMS. THE COMMITTEE BACKGROUND COVERED WELL THE COMPLICATED PUSH AND PULL THAT THIS INVOLVES. RESTRICTING ONE OF THESE FACTORS WILL LEAD TO A REACTION AND ANOTHER. IF RATES ARE HELD TO LOW IN AN INSURABLE GENERALLY PULL BACK ON UNDERWRITING MEANING KEEPING FEWER HIGH RISK PROPERTIES IN ORDER TO STAY SOLVENT. MANDATING INCREASE CLAIMS PAYMENTS WILL REQUIRED INSURER TO THEN SEEK HIGHER RATES. WHICH IF THE KNIGHT WILL LEAD TO STRICTER UNDERWRITING. IN THE END AN INSURER CANNOT OPERATE SAFELY AT LOW RATES WELL TAKING ALL RISKS AND PAYING EVER INCREASING CLAIMS. SO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAS A COMPLICATED JOB. THE CURRENT AVAILABILITY ISSUES FOR HIGH FIRE RISK COMMUNITIES ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO UNSUSTAINABLY LOW STATEWIDE AVERAGE PRICE LEVELS. AND IN YOUR PACKET I'VE OFFERED US A FEW SLIDES JUST PUT SOME PICTURES TO THE TESTIMONY. AN SLIDE ONE CALIFORNIA'S. PREMIUM IS SHOWN TO BE 17% BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. AND IT'S ALSO ALMOST. PAUSE WELL BROWN'S GETTING THE PRETTY SLIDE DOWN. SO CALIFORNIA'S AVERAGE PREMIUM A 17% THIS IS USING THE LATEST ANY I SEE DATA THAT CAME OUT LAST MONTH. IT'S 17% BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN ALMOST ONE HALF OF THE AVERAGE PRICE IN HURRICANE STATES LIKE LOUISIANA AND FLORIDA. EVEN THOUGH IT IS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS EXPENSIVE TO REBUILD A HOME IN THOSE LOWER COST GULF STATES. WELL THE AVERAGE PRICE OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN THE UNITED STATES HAS RISEN 53% IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. IT IS RISEN TEN POINT 6% IN CALIFORNIA. MOVING TO SLIDE TO IT SHOWS HOW CALIFORNIA HAS DIVERGED FROM THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. OVER TIME. AGAIN USING ANY I SEE DATA. THE ORANGE BAR IS THE MOVEMENT AND NATIONAL PRICING THE- MAROON ASH BAR IS CALIFORNIA. NOT ALLOWING PRICES TO INCREASE WITH THE ECONOMY MAY WORK IN THE SHORT TERM BUT OVER TIME WILL LEAD TO MUCH HIGHER CATCH UP INCREASES LATER. THAT ARE A SHOCK TO ORDINARY HOUSEHOLD BUDGETS. MOVING TO SLIDE THREE STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND REALLY ENDING IN TWENTY SIXTEEN INSURANCE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE FACED A PERIOD OF LOW CATASTROPHE LOSSES. BUT EACH YEAR GENERATED A MODEST INDUSTRY WIDE UNDERWRITING PROFIT AS AT THE SMALL GREEN BARS ON INDUSTRY WIDE BASIS AND WHEN COMBINED OVER TIME YOU CAN SEE WITH THE BLUE LINE IT CULMINATED IN A TEN POINT TWO BILLION DOLLAR HISTORIC UNDERWRITING PROFIT DATING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE. DURING THIS TIME THE CD I BECAME CONCERNED. THAT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE PRICES WERE TOO HIGH RELATIVE TO THESE LOW LOSSES. AND BEGAN ASKING INSURERS WHETHER THE PRICES WERE TOO HIGH. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE CD I EVEN ORDERED THE STATE'S LARGEST HOMEOWNERS INSURER STATE FARM. TO REDUCE ITS RATE LEVEL BY 7% EVEN THOUGH THE COMPANY WAS SEEKING A 6% INCREASE. THAT MATTER IS STILL IN LITIGATION AND STATE FARM IS CURRENTLY CHARGING THE SAME PRICE IT WAS FIRST PERMITTED TO CHARGE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. WHAT COMPANY CAN CONTINUE BUSINESS AS USUAL WITHOUT A PRICE INCREASE IN FIVE YEARS. ALSO SLIDE THREE INDICATES THINGS CHANGE DRAMATICALLY IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN WHEN THE CUMULATIVE INDUSTRY WIDE UNDERWRITING PROFIT DATING BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY ONE WAS A RACE IN A SINGLE YEAR. THAT'S THAT LARGE RED BAR. THEN THERE WAS A REPEAT. THE NEXT YEAR AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN. GIVEN THE EXPECTED ACCELERATION OF CATASTROPHIC FIRE LOSSES pRELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE DECISION BY MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES TO ELEVATE WILD FIRE TO A TOP TIER CREDIT RATING FACTOR. THERE SIGNIFICANT ENSURE A CONCERN ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY OF CURRENTLY APPROVED PRICE LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA. THIS CONCERN WILL LIKELY CONSTRAIN AVAILABILITY IN HIGH FIRE RISK AREAS UNTIL IT IS ADDRESSED. THE LAST SLIDE. A SLIDE FORWARD SHOWS THAT THIS SITUATION IS COMPLICATED IT'S COMPLICATED FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS COMPLICATED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS OVER FIFTY INSURERS HAVE SOUGHT RATE INCREASES FROM THE CD I. AND WHILE THE AVERAGE RATE INCREASE THAT THE CD EYES METHODOLOGY. WOULD JUSTIFY WAS TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT. THE AVERAGE RATE INCREASE ACTUALLY SOUGHT BY INSURERS WAS SIX POINT 3% THIS IS A REAL PROBLEM WHY WOULDN'T AN INSURER SEEK A LARGER RATE APPROVAL EVEN IF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS ON RULES WOULD SAY IT'S JUSTIFIED. THE ANSWER IS THAT UNDER STATE LAW. A PUBLIC INTERVENOR GROUP CAN DEMAND AND RECEIVE A PUBLIC HEARING. ON ANY RATE FILING THE 7% OR MORE. THESE PUBLIC HEARINGS INVOLVE THE APPOINTMENT OF ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. AND ON AVERAGE THE PROCESSING TIME IS FOURTEEN MONTHS. INSTEAD OF THE FIVE MONTHS THAT SLIDE FOUR INDICATES THIS THE NORMAL PROCESSING TIME. OVER TIME HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE FOR INSURERS TO FILE SIX POINT 9% OR LESS. THIS SYSTEM THEN OBVIOUSLY HAS AN OBVIOUS DOWNSIDE IF INSURANCE CANNOT GET TO RATE ADEQUACY QUICKLY BUT IT WILL TAKE LONGER FOR AN INSURER TO BE FULLY OPEN FOR NEW AND RENEWAL BUSINESS A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS AN INSURER TO SAFELY AND QUICKLY ACHIEVE RATE ADEQUACY. WILL BENEFIT THE PUBLIC IMMENSELY INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT SYSTEM THE FORCES TOO MANY RESIDENTS IN HIGH RISK AREAS INTO THE FAIR PLAN. FOR THE NON ADMITTED MARKET. WHILE THE VOLUNTARY MARKET PRICING SLOWLY A JESS TO THE RISK OF THE NEW NORMAL. ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE SUGGESTS THAT THE CD ICE PROCESSING TIME IS STARTING TO SLOW. ONLY DUE TO THEIR LARGE WORKLOAD BUT ALSO AN EMERGENCY THE AYE PRACTICE OF WITHHOLDING APPROVALS OF UNDISPUTED RATE INCREASES UNTIL THE INSURER AGREES TO REDUCE ITS NON RENEWALS OR AGREE TO OTHER NON RATING ISSUES. EACH ADDITIONAL CASE A FURTHER DELAY FOR THE REDUCES THE ABILITY OF AN INSURER TO COMMENCE COMPETITION. WE LOOK FORWARD TO COLLABORATING WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR AND THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER ON THE BEST WAY FORWARD. THIS HEARING CERTAINLY STARTS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO WHAT ROLE CATASTROPHE MODELS AND THE NET COST OF REINSURANCE COULD PLAY IN RATING. AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AT THIS POINT I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR MEMBERS WHO HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. STRUCTURE LETTER. THANK YOU MARTINE FOR BEING HERE IN OUR REGARDS TO OUR COMMISSIONER AND- AND- ALSO REPRESENTED FROM THE INSURANCE COMPANY. OF COURSE WE'RE HERE TO TRY TO WORK SOMETHING OUT AND I THINK THAT THE SPIRIT. BUT I'M HEARING FROM BOTH OF YOU BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. CALIFORNIA WE OBVIOUSLY HEADS OF DEVASTATION WITH OUR FIRES AND SO MANY FAMILIES WERE FOUND HOMELESS AND WONDERING IF THEY WERE EVER GOING TO BE REBUILT OR HOMERED. OR IF THEY EVEN GET PAID FOR THEIR YEARS AND YEARS OF LOYALTY WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANY. AND HERE COMES THE FIRE AND SO THERE IT IS. BUT NOW WE'RE FACED WITH REBUILDING. REGROUPING AND SORT OF THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT YOU HAD MENTIONED. THE BILL MISS MARTINEZ AND AFFORDABLE. TO THE YOUNG HOMEOWNER THAT THAT SOMEONE WHO'S BEEN THERE AND PROPERTY FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS- I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT I THINK THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANY IS TRYING TO SAY. WE NEED TO RECOUP WE NEED TO. TO PERHAPS RECOUP REINVEST WHATEVER THEY'RE GONNA DO BUT- THEY'VE GOT HONOR THESE CLAIMS AND THAT'S GONNA OBVIOUSLY COST MONEY THAT'S GONNA SET THEM BACK. BUT WHAT. DID YOU HAVE AN IDEA OFWHAT TO HOW WE SHOULD PUSH HIS AND TO WHAT LEVEL. BECAUSE THE FAIR PLAN IS. YOU KNOW IT IS BEING. PUSHED AND PUSHED NOW IT WE'RE GONNA BE ASKING MORE MORE THE FAIR PLAN. THE COST FACTORS IMPORTANT. IN THE RATE INCREASES THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR. SOMETHING I WOULD THINK THAT. THE SUREST COMMISSIONER WITH VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT IT'LL TAKE THAT. IT MIGHT LEVEL IN BALANCE THINGS OFF BECAUSE IT IS TRUE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. MUST PAY THESE CLAIMS MUST BE READY FOR THE NEXT. ISSUE OF PROBLEMS WITH GOOD COULD BE STORMS COULD BE FIRES COULD BE WHATEVER. SO THEY'VE GOT TO BE READY FINANCIALLY READY AND WE KNOW THAT. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. DAY OF GOT ALSO LOOK AT THE NORMAL. HOMEOWNER WHO'S TRYING TO MAKE THAT HOUSE PAYMENTS. AND MAINTAIN THAT INSURANCE SO CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT A LITTLE BIT MISTER MARTINEZ. THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION AND- THAT THAT IS A ONE OF THE LARGEST QUESTIONS TACIT IS FOR THAT BALANCE IF YOU WILL OR THE QUANDARY BETWEEN AVAILABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY OF IN THIS CASE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND- AND SO IT IN AND ONE ASPECT OF. WE HAVE. INSURERS ARE REQUESTING ADDITIONAL RATE INCREASES THAT. AS PART OF THIS THE THIS VOTE. EVERY DAY AND OF THE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE ARE MOVING FORWARD AND AS LONG AS THE FILED RATE IS NOT EXCESSIVE INADEQUATE UNFAIRLY DISCRIMINATORY THE DEPARTMENT HAS APPROVED THAT ABOUT THAT INCREASED NOW ON THE FLIP SIDE- OR WITH THAT BEING SAID IS THAT THEN IT MEANS THE DOUBLE DIGIT MEANS POTENTIALLY EVEN TRIPLE DIGIT INCREASES FROM ANY POLICY HOLDERS. AND THAT'S AS IT STANDS TODAY AND THEN. GIVEN ALSO WITH THE REPRESENTATIVES OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY FAILING AS WHAT YOU STATED IS WANTING TO EVEN MORE RECOUP- OF COSTS IN BEING ABLE TO LEVEL IT'S SOMETHING WHERE AT LEAST FROM THE COMMISSIONERS PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE'RE WANTING TO FIND THAT BALANCE OF BEING ABLE TO ENSURE THAT UNDER PROP ONE OF THREE READ THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO LOOK AND REGULATE AND- PRIOR PROVES RATES AS THE AND FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT WE HAVE A- A HEALTHY AND VIBRANT INSURANCE MARKET PLACE ESPECIALLY AND ADMITTED- CARRIERS LINED SO. THE SORRY IS TO SAY THAT IN ADDITION TOWN HALLS OF INDIVIDUALS COMING TO US IN THE COMMISSIONER SAYING EXACTLY WHAT YOU'VE OUTLINED OF. IT'S VERY HARD TO ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO MEET. THESE INCREASES THAT ARE ALREADY BEING APPROVED ON THE- IT'S THAT CAR IS TO SAY IT'S THAT COMPLICATED DON'T HAVE THE ANSWER FOR YOU RIGT HERE RIGHT NOW BUT TO SAY IT'S SOMETHING THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS POLICY DISCUSSION WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO KEEP THIS IN MIND AND THERE IS THERE COULD BE THAT. TERRY OF THAT. WITH HELLO I'M INDUSTRY BEEN ABLE TO. BE ABLE. TO PROPS TO HELP ANSWER THIS QUESTION TOO BUT IT'S JUST LIKE BUT I THINK THAT IT'S AS WE MOVE FORWARD ON POTENTIAL REFORMS. THAT IT ALSO IS ENSURING THE INDIVIDUALS IN THESE. NON RENEWED AREAS CAN CONTINUE TO HAVE AVAILABLE INSURANCE AT THEIR FINGERTIPS THAT'S OVER ALSO FOR FINDING IS THAT. THE VERY ABILITY TO HAVE INSURANCE ACTUAL AVAILABILITY OF INSURANCE IS THAT IS THE CHALLENGE- LET ALONE EVEN BE ABLE TO PAY IT BUT WERE NOW COMING ACROSS WHERE INSURANCE IS ACTUALLY NOT BEING IT BEING AVAILABLE. AND SO IS AS AGAIN AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THINKING ABOUT- REFORMS FOR THIS YEAR. IN KEEPING IN MIND THE AFFORDABILITY. SO THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND THE PERFORMANCE ON THE MARKET. AND I WANTED. TO TRY COLLEGE MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL YEAH I'LL JUST ADD THAT. AS OF MISTER MARTINEZ JUST SAID WE'RE ALREADY APPROVING THE RATE INCREASES OF THE PREMIUMS OF ALREADY GONE UP. WHAT WE'RE HOPING NOW IS TO BRING THOSE PREMIUMS DOWN BY MITIGATING FUTURE LOSS THE ONLY WAY TO BRING PREMIUMS DOWN IS TO REDUCE THE LIKELIHOOD OF LOS. AND WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT THEM MARKET. FULL FULL ONE THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET THAT MITIGATION ACTION. IN IN PLACE. AND YOU KNOW IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING THROUGHOUT THE STATE. UTILITIES ALREADY REDUCING BRUSH COMMUNITIES ARE ACTING. I MEAN THIS HAS REALLY SENT A MESSAGE FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN TO COMMUNITIES BUT THEY ARE HEARING PROBABLY IN YOUR OWN. SOUNDS THAT YOU LIVE IN LIKE PEOPLE GENERALLY IGNORE INSURANCE BUT NOW THEY'RE VERY AWARE OF THE VALUE INSURANCE- GIVEN WE'VE ALREADY. PROVIDED THE RATE INCREASES WE HOPE INSURERS WILL STICK WITH THEIR CONSUMERS. WELL WE GET THROUGH THIS TOUGH SPACE. GET THE HARDENING IN PLACE AND REDUCE THE RISK OF LOTS. AND IF I MAY FOLLOW UP MEDICARE. IN REFERENCE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY NOW ON BOARD AS YOU TO MENTION MITIGATING TRYING TO MAKE THEIR PROPERTY SAFER AND THEY'RE MOVING THE BRUSH ASIDE THE TREASON SO ON AND OR THEY'RE ADDING- TILE ROOFS OR WHATEVER THEY'RE DOING. TO PREVENT LOSS OF THEIR PROPERTY HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FIND OUT WHO'S DOING IT WHO'S NOT BRING THOSE RATES BACK DOWN TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS THAT ARE NECESSARY THAT I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET. CERTAINLY DIFFICULT MAN HAS TO BE PART OF THE APPROACH MOVING FORWARD WE'VE CERTAINLY EMBRACE. DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. WHAT IS REALISTICALLY A JUSTIFIED DISCOUNT. RELATED TO. TO MITIGATION UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SHOW YOU A DATA SET RIGHT NOW. THAT CAN QUANTIFY THAT ANY MEASURABLE DEGREE I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN SHOW YOU WHAT WOULD HAVE STOPPED THE FIRE FROM OVERRUNNING PARADISE. YOU KNOW AT SOME POINT. I MEAN WE WERE ACTIVE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT FOR THE BUILDING CODE UPGRADE WITH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND CERTAINLY WERE PART OF THE CHORUS OF VOICES SAYING WELL WE OUGHT TO HAVE. SCREENS OVER OUR- VENTS AND WE OUGHT TO HAVE COVERED EVE'S AND YOU KNOW LET LET'S REALLY LOOK AT WHAT CAN WE DO TO- TO ENCOURAGE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. BUT AS OF THIS POINT I DON'T THINK ANYONE CAN TELL YOU WITHOUT EVEN A LOW DEGREE OF CERTAINTY MUCH LESS A HIGH DEGREE OF CERTAINTY HOW INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AT THE PERSONAL LEVEL. OR COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION EFFORTS CAN LEAD TO A SPECIFIED REDUCTION IN THE RISK OF A LOSS. IN THE FOUNTAIN GROVE AREA I WAS A FIREPLACE COMMUNITY AND THEY HAD FOR BOARD MEMBERS ON THEIR FIRE WISE BOARD THAT LOST THEIR HOMES. EVEN THOUGH THEY HAD DONE A WONDERFUL JOB. SO THE NOTION THAT THERE'S AN EASY FIX THAT SOMEONE ON THEIR OWN PROPERTY US OR A SMALL COMMUNITY. CAN INSTANTLY JUST SAY WELL WE'VE DONE SOME MEDICATION EVERYTHING'S GOOD. I'M WE CERTAINLY DON'T BELIEVE THAT'S RIGHT. NOW WE CERTAINLY BELIEVE THAT WERE MULTIPLE- YEARS AHEAD OF US OF RESEARCHING THIS AND WE'RE CERTAINLY TRYING TO ADVANCE THE SCIENCE AS MUCH AS EVERYONE WE CERTAINLY. SUPPORTED ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN SPELL LAST YEAR FOCUSED ON. ADVANCING THE SCIENCE AS WELL. ULTIMATELY IN THE SHORT TERM WE HAVE AN IMBALANCE THAT. THAT IN THE SLIDES A I THINK IT PRESENTS IT VERY QUICKLY WE CERTAINLY DON'T THINK THAT JUST BECAUSE A COMPANY GETS A SIX POINT SOMETHING PERCENT INCREASE EVERYTHING'S GOOD. AND WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT JUST IS UNFORTUNATELY TAKING A LONG TIME. TO HAVE A PRICE INCREASES MOVE THROUGH THE SYSTEM AND- IF THAT'S THE POLICY DECISION OF THE STATE THERE'S AN OBVIOUS CONSEQUENCE FOR IT WHICH IS RESTRICTION OF AVAILABILITY AND THEN WHAT DOES THAT LEAVE THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER IN THE HIGHEST RISK COMMUNITIES WERE ABANDONING THEM AND SAYING THE ONLY SOLUTION WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU. IS THE FAIR PLAN WHICH WE KNOW IS WAY MORE EXPENSIVE IT HAS TO BE MORE EXPENSIVE AND IT'S NOT MEANT TO BE A PERMANENT. SOLUTION SO THERE HAS TO BE A SOLUTION BETWEEN FAIR PLAN PRICING AND WHERE THE PRICING LEVEL IS NOW. BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS TO A ROBUST. DEPENDABLE INSURANCE PRODUCT ANY GET RID OF THE ANXIETY THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING. THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK. AND I LEARNED ABOUT TSUNAMIS. SO I THOUGHT I BETTER NOT BY HOUSE ON THE PENINSULA IN ORANGE COUNTY AND THEN- ENJOYING- BACKPACKING IN THE CLEVELAND NATIONAL FOREST I THOUGHT OH MY GOODNESS OF I BOUGHT A PLACE UP IN MAJESTIC CANYON A THEY HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BUYERS SO. I DECIDE TO BUY A HOUSE ON THE FLOOD PLAIN. YEAH THIS PROCESS THE SEVEN OAKS THEM BOTH EVERYTHING. I GATHER SO THERE IS SOME RISK TO WHEREVER YOU CHOOSE TO OWN A HOME IN. IT SEEMS TO ME A FEW DECADES AGO THEY DID HAVE A PRETTY THOROUGH STUDY OF WILDFIRES IN. IN THE CONCLUSION THAT ONE OF THE MAJOR FACTORS WERE SHAKE ROOFS. AND SO CHANGE AND WE DON'T BUILD BUT SHAKE ROOFS AND IN WHAT AREAS SO I'M JUST CURIOUS WHAT MISTER MARK. LEARN FROM THE LAST TWO YEARS THE- HERE WE CAN MAKE A SIGNIFICANT MITIGATING IMPROVEMENTS- MISTER FRAZIER MENTIONED. GREENS AND SOME OTHER IDEAS BUT. WHAT TAKE AWAYS DO WE HAVE WHAT WE LEARN IN. ALL THIS DRESS THAT BRIEFLY THE THERE ARE MANY SO MANY CURRENT STUDIES GOING ON BY BOTH THE INDUSTRY AND OUR LOCAL. FIRE DEPARTMENTS WESTERN FIRE CHIEFS. ALL KINDS OF GROUPS THAT ARE GETTING TOGETHER AND LOOKING AT EFFECTIVE MITIGATION EFFORTS- IT DOES IT DOES GO BEYOND THE SCREENS WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IN IN TERMS OF THE KIND OF- SHRUBBERY THAT PEOPLE HAVE IN THEIR HOMES. THE USE OF. VARIOUS WAYS OF MAKING SURE THAT. YOU HAVE A PROTECTED SPACE BEYOND THE OLD DEFENSIBLE SPACE MAPS BUT REALLY ABOUT HOW TRIBES ARE TRIMMED ALL YOUR FENCES ATTACHED TO YOUR HOME THEY SHOULDN'T ATTACHED YOUR HOME OF THE OF A WOODEN FENCE THERE ARE JUST MANY LITTLE DETAILS. OF THINGS THAT WE DO NOW WE USE A WOODEN BALLS WOULD WOOD MULCH WHICH THE FIRE CHIEFS ARE SAYING LIKE THROWING LITTLE MATCHES OUT IN FRONT OF YOUR HOUSE. THERE ARE A LOT OF IMPACTS THAT WE COULD MAKE THAT. EVEN FIRE WISE COMMUNITIES OF JUST A COUPLE YEARS AGO HAD NOT TAKEN NO STEPS THEY HAD. FOLLOWED SOME OF THE THINGS IN PLACE AT THE TIME. BUT WE REALLY NEED NEW BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS. THE ABILITY TO HAVE MORE SPACE BETWEEN STRUCTURES. SO PART OF IT IS ABOUT MOVING FORWARD AND NEW CONSTRUCTION. AND THEN THERE ARE A WHOLE SET OF RULES ABOUT THINGS WE DID BEFORE. NINETEEN SIXTIES VERY POPULAR TO PUT. IT PINE TREES IN CYPRUS PUSHES THE WORST HANDLES THAT WE COULD HAVE NEXT DOOR HOMES. OTHER LOT OF THINGS WE CAN DO. AND A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE CAN DO THAT ARE NEW OR NEW CONSTRUCTION MOVING FORWARD. THAT OF BOTH THE- BE A SAFETY STUDIES DONE BY THE INDUSTRY. A BACK IN THERE'S CENTER BACK IN- SOUTH CAROLINA IN. CHS WHAT IS IT AB EIGHT I VHS AS WELL AS WESTERN FIRE CHIEFS LOCAL FIRED. CAL FIRE THEY ALL ARE COMING TOGETHER WITH THE RECOMMENDATIONS F THINGS THAT ARE QUITE EFFECTIVE TO DO. WHEN CAN WE EXPECT TO GET THAT REPORTER THAT STUDY. WELL MY TOWN HAD A MEETING LAST WEEK TO TALK ABOUT CHANGING OUR BUILDING REQUIREMENTS SO. IT IS IT DOES GO DOWN TO COMMUNITY BY COMMUNITY DECISION MAKING. FOR MOST OF THE CODES THERE ARE STATE BUILDING CODES THAT WILL LIKELY CHANGE GOING FORWARD BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES MOVING FORWARD THEMSELVES. OF MARIN COUNTY HAS IT'S OWN ACTION PLANS AS A COMMISSIONER LARA GOES OUT TO EACH OF THE SEPARATE COUNTIES WE ARE MEETING WITH COUNTY SUPERVISORS AND STATE LEGISLATORS AND HEARING IN EACH OF THESE COUNTIES. THAT IS GENERATING THEIR OWN ON A MOVEMENT FORWARD TO DEAL WITH MEDICATION. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ARE LOOKING FOR IS A LITTLE MORE STANDARDIZATION SO THAT THEY KNOW THAT THE EFFORTS THEY MAKE. WILL BE THE ONES THAT MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN GET KEEPING THEIR INSURANCE COVERAGE. SINCE I'VE CENTER IF I COULD OF JUNE OR JUST A- JUST A JUST OUT I'D BE REMISS ALSO IF- ONE PARTICULAR PART PROGRAM THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE HEARD AND I'M HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM SOME INFORMATION THE WILDFIRE. WILDFIRE PARTNERS PROGRAM IN BOULDER. COLORADO AND THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS A CURRENTLY EXISTING PROGRAM- THAT'S AGAIN IN COLORADO THAT'S BEEN AROUND SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN. THAT HAS THREE COMPONENTS BALD FAR RISK INSPECTIONS HOME AND COMMITTEE WILD FIRE MITIGATION AND A GUARANTEE OF HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE POLICY THROUGH THE ADMITTED MARKET FOR CERTIFIED HOMEOWNERS. AND THAT IS AN EXISTING PROGRAM THE COMMISSIONER HAS REALLY BEEN VERY INTRIGUED ABOUT THAT AND AGAIN I DO HAVE AYE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOUR OFFICE WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW. THAT WE HAVE SHARED WITH- OTHER INDIVIDUALS ON THIS COMMITTEE BUT IT'S SOMETHING WHERE ACTUALLY WITH THE PROPERTY ASSESSMENT A HOMEOWNER. A MUST LIVE PARTICULAR WILD AS A- THEY ARE A- ON THE HOLES OWNED A MEDICATIONS. GOES OF THE PROPERTY LOOKS AT THE PROPERTY ASSESSES THE- A REPORT IS CHECK. ON REQUIRED IN RECOMMENDED MITIGATION STANDARDS THAT MUST BE MAINTAINED IN A CERTIFICATION IS PROVIDED TO THAT HOMEOWNER. WHICH THAT IS USED TO CONTINUE OUR OR OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE AND WITH THAT BECAUSE OF THIS PROGRAM. THERE ARE MANY PARTNERS IN THE ADMITTED INSURANCE MARKET PLACE THAT YOU WILL RECOGNIZE MANY OF THE PARTICIPANTS ENSURE. PROGRAM AT. A THESE AND- IN THE MID MARKET IS. RECEIVE THIS DIFFICULT AS PREFER PROP FIRE MEDIC. THAT'S CAN. THEIR VAN AND VALA AGREED THAT CERTIFY HOMEOWNER WILL BE NON RENEWED JUST WILD FIRE HOW AND SO IT'S SOMETHING WHERE. OF WE BELIEVE A AND A- Mà THAT HAS ALREADY IN EXISTENCE TODAY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH INDUSTRY. CENTER IF I MAY ADD TO THAT IT IS A PARTNERSHIP PREDOMINATELY BETWEEN LOCAL THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT THERE THE COUNTY IS PUT IN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF AMOUNT OF MONEY TO FACILITATE THE INSPECTION AND VERIFICATION PROCESS THAT IS A VOLUNTARY PROGRAM IN COLORADO. ON SLIDE ONE WE DID INCLUDE A COMPARISON TO COLORADO BECAUSE WE ASSUME THIS WOULD COME UP. IT'S IMPORTANT TO SEE THAT THE AVERAGE PREMIUM IN COLORADO IS SO I'M WE CAN TALK ABOUT THINGS THAT ARE MITIGATION RELATED AND WE SHOULD AND WE'RE ATTEMPTING TO PUSH THE SCIENCE AS QUICKLY AS ANYONE ELSE'S AND THERE'S MANY INVOLVED IN THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH NEST IS VERY ACTIVE AS WELL INDUSTRY AS A LEADING AGENT FOR THIS RESEARCH THROUGH AYE BHS WE CARE DEEPLY ABOUT GETTING TO THE ROOT OF WHAT CAN WE DO THAT'S WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO MITIGATE LOSSES AND HOPEFULLY DECELERATE THE RATE OF INFLATION. OF PRICING. BUT WE SHOULDN'T IGNORE OTHER RELEVANT DATA SUCH IS THE DISPARATE. INSURANCE PRICING. EVEN IN A PLACE LIKE COLORADO WHERE THERE ARE I CERTAINLY LESS THAN FIVE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE THAT PROGRAM. WORK WORK FOR THEM. I'M. SO THERE'S A LOT OF WORK AHEAD BUT I SO FAR LOOK AT THIS WHAT HAPPENED IN FLORIDA AND AFTER NINETEEN NINETY TWO WHEN A HURRICANE BANKRUPTED ELEVEN INSURANCE COMPANIES WELL IT KICKED OFF A MASSIVE INVESTMENT IN UNDERSTANDING WHAT CAN WE DO WHAT'S WITHIN OUR CONTROL TO REDUCE THE RISK OF LOSS RELATED TO WIND THEN AFTER BOTH LOMA PRIETA AND THEN THE NORTHRIDGE QUAKE AND WE HAD A SUBSTANTIAL MARKET DISRUPTION IN HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE AND NINETEEN NINETY SIX THE CULMINATED IN THE CREATION OF THE CA. THAT KICKED OFF AN ENORMOUS EFFORT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT'S WITHIN OUR CONTROL FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS AND THEN ULTIMATELY NOW WE HAVE THE BASEBALL PROGRAM THROUGH THE CA AND WE'RE AT THE BEGINNING OF THAT PROCESS NOW FIRE BECAUSE WE WANT TO FEEL IN CONTROL WE WANT TO SAY IF I DO X. Y. Z. TO MY HOUSE FOUR OF MY COMMUNITY THIS OF WITH A GOLF COURSE THAT LIMITS WILL THAT HELP US. AND WE HAVE TWO A DAY SCIENCE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE SIMPLY NOT THE CASE OF SAYING YOU DO THIS YOU REDUCE THE RISK OF LOSS BY THAT THAT SCIENCE TO SIMPLY DOES NOT EXIST AT THIS POINT BEFORE WE MOVE FORWARD I WANNA STRESSED OUT WE WERE ON THIS TOPIC THIS CALLER I DON'T ALLOW. AND TO BE. A THE RATE IN PROCESS. I WAS LOOKING BACK THE REINSURANCE CáC. I THINK IT'S THE IS FOR EIGHT OTHER STATES THAT MY UNDERSTANDING FORTY EIGHT OTHER STATES THAT DO ALLOW REINSURANCE AND THERE AND I BELIEVE COLORADO IS ON ITS IT'S- GHETTO. ALLOW SCOTT WASHINGTON. CALIFORNIA THE ONLY THREE THAT DON'T ALLOW FOR THAT'S ON WONDERING IF I'M WRONG THAT COLORADO ALLOWS OUR INSURANCE IT WAS WOULD LIKELY WILL WILL WILL CONFIRM THAT AND- YAH YEAH WILL FOLLOW UP AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW IT ALSO CAN YOU ADDRESS THAT IF THEY DID ALLOW THE REINSURANCE WITH THAT MAKE IT MORE TOLERABLE TO. BE ABLE TO PROVIDE MORE COVERAGE I IN STE IN STATES WITH PRICING FLEXIBILITY WHERE THERE'S NOT SUCH A- A LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RISK AND PRICE YOU DON'T SEE THESE TYPE OF AVAILABILITY ISSUES FOR SURE. IN YEAH JUST WHILE WE'RE ON THE TOPIC OF REINSURANCE YOU KNOW THE AIRPLANE RATES TO INCLUDE THE ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY'S RATES DO INCLUDE THE ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE. SO THIS ISN'T A FOREIGN CONCEPT TO CALIFORNIA'S JUST RIGHT NOW. IF YOU'RE IN ADMITTED ENSURE IF YOU'RE A VOLUNTARY MARKET ENSURE THAT IS COMPELLED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE FAIR PLAN. WELL THAT PRICING DOES INCLUDE THE ACTUAL COST OF REINSURANCE-BUT SOMEHOW IF IT'S JUST YOU. THEN WE TAKE A DIFFERENT POSITION AND I UNDERSTAND THE DEPARTMENT'S LONG STANDING IDEOLOGICAL POSITION ON FEAR OF THINGS GETTING OUT OF CONTROL. AND THAT'S WHY IN THEIR REGULATIONS THEY DO PUT PARAMETERS AROUND. A PURPOSEFUL ATTEMPTS TO USE REINSURANCE TO EVADE RATE REGULATION WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS. BUT TO DATE WE JUST WE SIMPLY HAVEN'T BUT WE HOPE THAT CAN BE PART OF THE DISK. PART WITH. WHEN DOESN'T HAVE THE COST OF INSURANCE IN HER CURRENT RATES. AND THE RATES IN CALIFORNIA ARE BASED ON THE LOSSES EXPERIENCEDBY INSURERS RATE SETTING. PROCESS EVALUATES INSURER'S LOSSES. AND SETS A RATE THAT WILL PAY FOR THE EXPECTED LOSSES IN THE COMING YEAR. IF THE OTHER STATES ARE DOING THE SAME. AND THEY HAVE HIGHER PREMIUMS IT WOULD MEAN THAT THEY'RE EXPECTING MORE LOSSES. SO IF YOU CLARIFY SOMETHING YOU JUST SAID I'M SORRY I THOUGHT I HEARD YOU SAY THAT THE FAIR PLAN DOES NOT ALLOW IT DOESN'T INCLUDE THAT THE REINSURANCE AS PART OF RATE MAKING. IS THAT ACCURATE OR PLANS CURRENT RATES DO NOT INCLUDE A PRICE OF REASSURANCE. HE LAN HAS THE ABILITY IF IT WERE TO NEED ADDITIONAL FUNDING. TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OF THE INDUSTRY. IT HAS NOT DONE AN ASSESSMENT IN DECADES IT ACTUALLY HAS DONE DISTRIBUTIONS. OF MONEY IN RECENT DECADES- BUT THEY- THE RAKES CURRENTLY DO NOT INCLUDE ANY REINSURANCE COSTS. BUT CAN THAT INCLUDED WHEN THEY DO THE REASSESSMENT. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO INCLUDE IT LATER ON CORRECT WITHOUT GOING TO THE CITY I'M PERMITS THE TERM AN REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE AIRPLANES RATES SO THAT WOULD BE A DECISION BY THE DEPARTMENT ON THE COMMISSIONER. OF WHETHER THE FAIR PLAN WOULD GET ME INSURANCE AND THAT'S RIGHT. IT IS NOT. THE RATE MAKING ISN'T SPECIFIC TO THE PROP ONE OF THREE REGULATIONS THAT. OTHER INSURERS HAVE BEEN HELD TO. I'M SORRY I INTERRUPTED THE PROCESS OF MISTER BORDERS WHO WERE NEXT YOU WANTED TO A MONTH SORRY WERE YOU DONE. YOU AND I CAN. LET'S GO MISTER BURGESS AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO USE THAT OKAY MISTER BRIDGES. WORK I WANT TO A THANK INSURANCE COMMISSIONER- MEASURE LOTTE CAME TO. MY DISTRICT- I REPRESENT ELEVEN COUNTIES- MANY OF WHICH- FIRE PRONE COUNTIES. AND IT WAS IT WAS A SHOCKING EXPERIENCE HAVING A TOWN HALL. PEOPLE ARE SCARED THEY HAVE EVERY RIGHT TO BE SCARED. AND NOT JUST BASED ON WHAT IS AT ISSUE RIGHT NOW PUBLIC SAFETY BUT LONG TERM. YOU HAVE CHILDREN BOB PARENTS ARE WONDERING WHETHER NON TO ON THEIR KIDS NEED TO BE RELOCATED TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE. AS SCHOOL FUNDING MAY GO DOWN GIVEN POPULATION DECLINES QUALITY OF LIFE SO IT'S A COMPLETE TRICKLE DOWN EFFECT. AND I THINK YOU YOU CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT FOR ME IT WAS VERY MUCH A LEARNING EXPERIENCE IN A PAINFUL LEARNING EXPERIENCE. ODD TO HEAR THE GRIEF THAT THE- MY CONSTITUENTS WERE OR GOING THROUGH. SO I THINK THERE WAS A NUMBER OF IDEAS THAT- INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LOT I HAD. BUT FOR THAT HE WAS GOING TO EXPLORE. IN THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE- MAYBE AT THE END OF MY QUESTION YOU CAN COMMENT IF YOU'RE AWARE OF ANY. A SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES THAT HE WOULD BE PROPOSING. BUT YOU KIND OF CAUGHT MY ATTENTION- IS TO PRESERVE. YOU HAD TALKED ABOUT- OTHER RISK PRONE AREAS OF THE STATE. NOW MY FRIEND FROM ORANGE COUNTY HAD MENTIONED. TSUNAMI PRONE AREAS EARTHQUAKE PRONE AREAS FLOOD PRONE AREAS. HOW IT HAS THE INDUSTRY OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME ADJUSTED TO THOSE RISK PRONE AREAS TO THE LOCALIZED IS THE INDUSTRY TEND TO LOCALIZE ARE THE CALCULATION OF THE THREAT IN THE PREMIUMS IN THAT AREA OR CAN IT BLEED OUT IN FUNGIBLE A. B. OFFSET ELSEWHERE. I'M GENERALLY THEY TRY TO DO THE FORMER IN MAKING AN INSURANCE RATE REMEMBER IT'S A TWO STEP PROCESS THE FIRST DECISION IS TO TESTIFIED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE WHAT IS THE AVERAGE RATE LEVELTHAT YOU'RE PERMITTED TO CHART AS IF YOU WERE GONNA CHARGE EVERYONE THE SAME. WHICH PEOPLE DON'T. THEN THE SECOND STEP IS TO FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE UNIQUE RISK CHARACTERISTICS PRESENTED BY THE PARTICULAR APPLICANT AND THAT CAN RESULT IN AN UPWARD OR DOWNWARD. IMPACT ON THE RATE THAT THE OR THE PREMIUM THAT SOMEONE ELSE LEE PACE. SO MUCH OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS THE AVERAGE RATE LEFT BEFORE YOU GET TO LOOKING AT REGIONAL DISTINCTIONS BUT SO BE A CHARACTER AN INSURER PLACES ITSELF AT. RISK IF IT SIMPLY TRIES TO SAY WE'RE GOING TO AN AVERAGE RATE THAT WILL LEAD TO THE SO CALLED DEATH SPIRAL. WHICH IS THE UNDER PRICE AREA. WHEN THEY DO THAT ON WILL JUMP ON THEM AND SO YOU YOU GUYS HAVE GREAT PRICE WE'RE COMING WITH YOU. AND THEN THEY'LL BE OVER PRICED IN AN- OTHER AT. AND THEY WON'T GET THIS THERE AND ULTIMATELY THEY'LL END UP HAVING AN APPROVED RATE LEVEL BUT THEY'LL BE GETTING THE RISK CHARACTERISTICS. OF A MUCH MUCH HIGHER RISK LEVEL. SO OF COURSE EACH COMPANY HAS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT CRISIS TO RISK. AS THE RISK PRESENTS ITSELF OR ELSE THEY SET THEMSELVES UP FOR SOLVENCY ISSUES. THE ISSUE IN SOME OF THE MOUNTAIN TERRITORIES THAT- I REPRESENT WHERE YOU HAD A LOT OF THE- BUYERS. I THINK THE ONLY TWO CARRIERS THAT EXISTED MY KNOWLEDGE IS DATED THIS IS A LEASE TO. A YEAR OR MORE. LLOYDS OF LONDON I THINK YET SCOTTSDALE BOTH OF WHICH ARE OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT WHEN. THESE ENTITIES ARE OUTSIDE DO THEY PAY IN TO THE FAIR PLAN. CAN YOU CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE ON HOW THAT PLAYS OUT. SO THE- AN INSURED ISN'T THE TO GO TO THE FAIR PLAN UNLESS THEY CAN'T FIND COVERAGE IN THE ADMITTED MARKET. THAT DOES. FIRST MEAN GOING TO BE ADMITTED CARRIERS THAT WERE MOST FAMILIAR WITH AND TRYING TO FIND COVERAGE. AND A SURPLUS LINES CARRIER CAN'T WRITE A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY UNLESS THAT CAN CONSUMER CAN'T FIND COVERAGE IN THE ADMITTED MARKET. PROHIBITED FROM PARTICIPATING AS A FIRST LEVEL OFFER OF COVERAGE AND PART OF THE- A SO THAT LEAVES THEM OUT OF THE COMMITMENT OF BACKING THE FAIR PLAN ESSENTIALLY BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT AN ACTIVE PARTICIPANT IN THE ADMITTED MARKET. YOUR PLAN IS THAT LAST STOP AND IT'S KIND OF THE MIGHT SEE IT AS THE- INDUSTRY'S COST BETWEEN FULLY OF GETTING THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE THE BEST BUSINESS. THEN THEY BECOME THE BACKSTOP FOR THE BUSINESS THAT THEY TURNED AWAY BECAUSE IT'S TOO HIGH RISK FOR THEIR UNDERWRITING. THE NOT A MINUTE MARKETS REALLY A SAFETY VALVE THAT'S EXISTED FOR A LONG TIME. THE REASON THEY'RE NOT ADMITTED COMPANIES THEY'RE NOT PHYSICALLY PRESENT THERE'S NO PERSONAL JURISDICTION OVER THEM THEY RESIDE OUTSIDE OF THE STATE. SO THERE'S A SPECIAL PROCESS HAPPEN FOR LONG ARM SAID. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT WE HAVE TO SET UP A SPECIAL PROCESS FOR AN INTERMEDIARY WHO IS PHYSICALLY PRESENT HERE TO BE ABLE TO EXECUTE THAT TRANSACTION. BUT IT IS THE SURPLUS LINE MARKET IS ALWAYS A SAFETY VALVE IN IT'S TYPICALLY NOT USE THAT MUCH IN PERSONAL LINES IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE USED IN. AN AUTO EXCEPT FOR MAYBE SORT OF EXOTIC CAR THAT YOU WOULDN'T ORDINARILY BE ABLE TO FIND A CARRIER FOR. BUT IT'S TYPICALLY MORE FOR LARGER COMMERCIAL RISKS YOU KNOW LET'S SAY PLACES WHERE PEOPLE GET HURT A BOWLING ALLEY RIGHT THAT MIGHT HAVE TO GO TO THE NON ADMITTED MARKET- BECAUSE IT'S A BUNCH SLIPPERY SHOES AND SLIPPERS. SLIPPERY FLOORS- AND SO THE NOT ADMITTED MARKET REALLY IS JUST SOMETHING THAT IS MEANT TO GROW DURING TIMES OF MARKET DISRUPTION PARTICULARLY IN AND PERSONAL LINES MARKET LKE HOMEOWNERS IT'S RELATIVELY LOW I WANNA SAY MAYBE AT ANY ONE TIME ONE PERCENT. OF MARKET. IN YOU KNOW DIRT TIMES LIKE THIS IT COULD GO. BUT BECOME QUE GAINS. AT SOME POINT. AND THEY HAVE A ABSOLUTE LIMIT ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN GROW. ANYWAY BUT IT IS I THINK- EVEN ADMITTED CARRIERS DON'T LOOK AT THE NOT A MINI MARKET A SORT OF COMPETITION IT'S UNNECESSARY SAFETY VALVE WHEN IT WHEN WE NEED IT. OUR LAST QUESTION ON IN MISTER MARTINEZ WHEN I'M DONE MAYBE IN YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS IF YOU WISH TALK ABOUT THE- INSURANCE COMMISSIONER LADAS- IDEAS FOR LEGISLATION IN THE PSYCH- I THINK THE. WELL. I'LL SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER FOLLOWED ANOTHER FOLLOW UP MEETING. THANK YO JIM THANK YOU SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR OF BEING HERE OF SIGNIFICANT ISSUE MY QUESTION TAKES US BACK I THINK TO THE MITIGATION ISSUES IN THE STANDARDIZATION OF THAT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE I SEE A REAL IMPORTANT COMMON DENOMINATOR IN THE RISK EVALUATION. IN MY COMMUNITY ARE SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY LIVE NEW DEVELOPMENT AND WE HAVE BEEN REQUIRED TO HAVE TO A LOT OF PATIENCE LOANS WE HAVE TO HAVE OFF HARDENING AROUND OUR PROPERTIES YOU CAN'T BUY ANYTHING SUCCULENTS MAYBE IN OUR OWNER SO SEASONS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THIS PLAN TO THE ORANGE COUNTY FIRE AUTHORITY DOES A REMARKABLE JOB IN THE ENFORCEMENT AN OVERVIEW BUT THAT'S ONE COMMUNITY INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH. ARE WE HAD MANY CALLS OF PEOPLE WHO LOST THEIR INSURANCE AFTER THE BIG FIRES OF 201-820-1720 EIGHTEEN YET THEY WERE BUILT TO WHAT WHAT I WOULD CONSIDER TO BE A PRETTY HIGH MITIGATION OF REQUIREMENT INCLUDING MY OWN PROPERTY SO WHEN WILL THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE HAVE SOMETHING THAT IS VERY RELIABLE FOR OUR INSURANCE- I INSURANCE PROVIDERS SO THAT WHEN THEY ARE LOOKING AT THE INSURANCE AND INSURANCE THEY HAVE A REAL SOLID STANDARD. OF CONSISTENT OVER COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MEETING WHAT AT LEAST EMPIRICALLY MIGHT BE THE BEST MITIGATION STANDARDS WE KNOW DATE WITH STING AT I'M THINKING HOW DO YOU HAVE SOME OUR RESEARCH I CHECKED WHERE YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE MITIGATION STANDARDS AND THEN YOU TRY TO BURN IT DOWN. WITHOUT KNOWING EXACTLY WHAT WORK OTHER THAN SPRINKLERS EVERYWHERE I'M NOT SURE WE CAN GET TO A STANDARD WHERE YOU CAN BE REQUIRING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ME TO LOWER THE RATES BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE. IN A CERTAIN ARE. I HOW TO GO OF RISK AVERSE SPEAK THEY MITIGATED PROPERLY. BECAUSE HARPER LEE SEEMS BE. MOVING IN A I GUESS IS IMPROVING A FINE DES. THAT MY PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT WERE REALLY HARM EVEN THOUGH THEY MAY OUT. AGAINST STANDARDS AND MANY OTHER OFFICE HAD TO GO TO THE FAIR PLAN- BUT I HAVE ALREADY MET WHAT I CONSIDER TO BE ONE OF THE HIGHEST STAND. EVEN EMPLOYEE GO COME OVER. UNDER BROWN. ALONG WITH MANAGER WITH TO BE YOU SEE A SO WHAT'S YOUR ANSWER I THINK MORE FOR YOU MISTER MARTINEZ WHETHER YOU ARE WORKING ON. GIVE US SOMETHING THAT'S MORE DEPENDABLE CONSISTENT RELIABLE FOR OUR ENSURE. THANK YOU SENATOR BASIN AND BEING A FORMER. AS YOU KNOW OF RESIDENT OF ORANGE COUNTY I'VE ALWAYS. KNOWN AND APPRECIATED THE- TREMENDOUS GROWTH IN THAT AREA% ESPECIALLY IN THE DISTRICT YOU REPRESENT. AND IN THAT WAS A AND SOME REPORTERS I- MAYBE IT CAN BE OF SERVICE TO FOR OF WHAT YOUR YOUR QUESTION WHAT YOU HAD. OF WHAT THE COMMISSION WAS INTERESTED. IN ALONG THE LINES OF THIS MEDICATION QUESTION THAT NO SENATOR BATES IS ASKING. YOUR QUESTION OF WHAT THE COMMISSIONERS INTERESTED AND- IS THAT. YEAH IT'S GOING TO BE IN ADDITION TO THE COMMISSIONER AND THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE BECAUSE WE'RE OF COURSE ONE WE FEEL STRONGLY EITHER TABLE BUT IN ADDITION WITH THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE MINISTRATION. BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD PREVIOUS IS THERE ARE- A LOT OF INCREASING STANDARDS OUT THERE I MEAN WE HAVE THE INDUSTRY WE HAVE CONSUMER GROUPS WE HAVE FIRE AUTHORITIES AND PROFESSIONALS. HERE IN THE STATE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND THE DEPARTMENT HAS CERTAINLY BEEN. BRINGING AND HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS ALREADY SINCE ONE THE COMMISSIONER WAS. SWORN IN OFFICE LAST TIME AS JANUARY OF HAVING A INDIVIDUALS COME TOGETHER AND TRYING AGAIN COLLATE AND FIGURE OUT WHAT ARE THE STANDARDS THAT WE CAN BRING TOGETHER THAT WORK FOR CALIFORNIA IT DOES EXTEND BEYOND WE BELIEVE IN ADDITION TO THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE BUT TOO AGAIN. WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH OTHER WITH THE ADMINISTRATION. AT WITH THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL MEAN YOU NAME IT THERE TELL FIREMAN THERE'S ALL THESE. INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ALL HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN WHAT. THE STANDARDS. COULD BE SHOULD BE WE SING LEGISLATION AS I MADE EARLIER AND REMARKS OF. OF ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BILLS MOVING FORWARD IT TO FURTHER CRYSTALLIZE WHAT. AGAIN THOSE STANDARDS SHOULD BE FOR HOME ARE NAMED FOR COMMUNICATION RESOLVE PENDING LEGISLATION ON IN BOTH HOUSES OF FURTHER TO HAVE DEFENSIBLE SPACE. I'M REQUIREMENTS AND SO ALL OF THIS IS I USED TO SAY THAT THAT THE LEGISLATURE AND POLICYMAKERS WE'VE BEEN ENGAGING THIS AND THIS ALL I MEAN ALL TOGETHER. AND SO EDIT WITH I MEAN WITH INDUSTRY MEAN AS INDUSTRY PRESENTS SO THAT THEY'VE SUPPORTED SEVERAL OF THESE BILLS AND YES ABSOLUTELY. AND TO YOUR POINT THIS IS A THIS WOULD BE A HUGE. I'D SAY THEME COMMONALITY IN ALL OF WHAT WE'RE SAYING. IS THAT. BEN AS WE MOVE FORWARD ITS AGAIN NOT BALANCE OF. WITH RATES. IN AN AND AFFORDABLE OF THEM HAVING A THESE CONSIST KNOWN THROUGHOUT MITIGATION STANDARDS THROUGHOUT. THE STATE HAVING THE STRUCTURAL SYSTEM FOR VERIFYING WHO MEETS THAT STANDARD ENSURING THAT THE STANDARDS. OF ONCE THEY'RE CREATED IN AND HOPEFULLY ON THIS EXPEDITED TIMELINE ONE WOULD. HOPE IS THAT THAN BEING ABLE TO CREATE. THE FOLKS THAT GO OUT THERE TO ENSURE THESE HOMES AND COMMITTEES AND MAINTAIN. AN INTRIGUING THAT AND CENTER FOR HOMEOWNERS IN COMMUNITIES TO MEET AND MAINTAIN THAT STANDARD AND THAT'S WHERE I CAN ON BECAUSE OF THAT. AS WE KNOW NEEDED A UNDER EXISTING CALIFORNIA STATE LAW. YES NO ONE CAN MANDATE INSURANCE TO A RECORD THERE'S NO MAN MANDATORY THOU SHALT HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE IN THESE PARTS OF THE STATE. YET AS PART OF THIS CONVERSATION AND THAT THE COMMISSIONER WITH ALL OF YOU WANT TO HAVE IS WHAT IS THAN- INPUTTING EVERYTHING OUT THERE- AS TO AGAIN THE STANDARDS OF RATES. OF HAVING THIS OF. INCENTIVES THAT HOMEOWNERS IN COMMUNITIES KNOW THAT WHEN THEY PUT IN THE RESOURCE IS THE TIME TO MITIGATE THEIR HOME AND COMMITTEES AND MAINTAIN IT BUT THEN IN TURN WILL KNOW THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE INSURANCE AT THE END OF THE DAY AND NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SENDING THEIR OF WORRY EVEN ABOUT HOW HIS POTENTIALLY HAVING THEIR FAMILY OR THEIR CHILDREN HAVE TO RELOCATE TO ANOTHER PART OF THE STATE I'M IN ORDER TO ANSWER TO SICK A QUALITY EDUCATION. AND SO I IT SO THAT IS SOMETHING OF WHERE WE WANTED TO- THE TECHNICIAN IS VERY COMMITTED TO ENGAGING IN THAT CONVERSATION AND THAT'S SOMETHING GOING TO BE ONE OF HIS IT'S A MAJOR- POLICY DISCUSSIONS ON THIS YEAR. WELL I JUST A FOLLOW UP COMMENT IT WOULD SEEM TO ME THAT THERE HAS TO BE A COROLLARY. FROM THE MITIGATION THAT YOU HAVE. PROVIDED ON YOUR CALL LED TO THE RATE INCREASE. ARE THE RATE RANGE THAT INSURERS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO HAVE FOR THAT PARTICULAR. I AM AREA RATHER THAN DESPLAT SUPPRESSION. OF THEIR ABILITY TO RAISE RATES SENATE AND CLEARLY THEY HAVE TO BE PART OF THAT EQUATION. BECAUSE ITS FINAL LIKE WILL I THINK I'VE DONE EVERYTHING IN YOUR CHARGING ME X. Y. Z. IS BE EASIER FOR THE INSURANCE- COMPANY TO SAY WELL YOU FALL IN LEVEL SEE. ODD TO GET TO LEVEL B. WHICH IS LOW OR YOU NEED TO HAVE THESE ADDITIONAL THINGS AND THEN THEY CAN MAKE THEIR CHOICE TO GO TO FAIR SOME OTHER THING BUT- SEEMS TO ME THAT THEY SEEM TO BE LOCKED OUT OF THE CONVERSATION. ON WHEN YOU RAISE OR SUPPRESS THE RATE INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE RISK BETH IN A PARTICULAR AREA. AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN PART OF THAT CONVERSATION JUST SEEMS LIKE. THE REAL ISSUE IS NOT STANDARDIZED MAYBE THE ASININE THING- AND THAT YOU HAVE RANGES. DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU LIVE IN WHAT MITIGATION YOU HAVE. BUT WHERE I LIVE I GRANT THE TOP OF THE SCALE WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING. WE CANNOT WE ALL PROPERTY DEBT TO THE WILD LAND WE CAN'T DO ANYTHING AND HOW STAY BEARER HAVES. OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND WE'RE VERY REGULATE. ARRAY OF. ABOUT NINE OF THEM MIGHT MAYBE IT ACTUALLY. AND I. THANK THAT YOU NEED TO BE OF THE CAR AS- GO FORWARD AND MAKE THINGS. ALSO OF THE EQUATION. THANK YOU MISTER MARKEY HAD A FALL QUESTION MAYBE JUST PICK UP FOR YOU WERE DISCUSSING WITH MARCH. ABOUT TO. THEY'RE NOT THE FAIR PLAN HAS REINSURANCE AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF IT DOES AND DIRECTLY BECAUSE YOU'RE RELYING ON THE CARRIERS TO BE YOUR BACKSTOP AND THEY USE REINSURER. THE DO THEY RELY ON THAT THEY RELY ON THE INSURERS INSURERS ACTUALLY HAVEN'T HAD TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS AND DECADES SO IT IS A POSSIBILITY IN ANY GIVEN YEAR. OF THAT THEY WOULD. DRAW ON INSURE- RESERVES. BUT THE LATEST DISTRIBUTION CZAR ASSESSMENTS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE FAIR PLAN TO THE INDUSTRY NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND. OF THE FAIR PLANS RATES ARE BASED ON ITS OWN LOSS EXPERIENCE AND IT HAS HAD VERY HIGH LOS EXPERIENCE AS AS THE REST OF THE INDUSTRY THEY HAVE A CURRENT RATE INCREASE WILD THEY'VE ALREADY HAD A RATE INCREASE APPROVED. AND SO THEIR RATES ARE ALSO A VERY DIFFICULT FOR A LOT OF PEOPLE TO AFFORD THEY THEY DO BUY REINSURANCE BUT THAT IS THEIR CHOICE TO DO. EVEN THOUGH WE DON'T ALLOW RE INSURANCE FLOW DIRECTLY INTO RATE MAKING FOR THE FAIR PLAN R FOR INSURERS. WE DON'T THE DOCTOR FROM THEIR LOSSES. THE AMOUNTS THAT THEY RECEIVED FROM REINSURERS IN COMPENSATION THAT COVERED LOSSES BY THE REINSURERS WE DON'T SAY WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIS HUNDRED MILLION OUT. AS THE REINSURERS REIMBURSE YOU FOR THAT THAT MONEY STAYS IN AND THE RATES ARE BASED ON THEIR ENTIRE LOS EXPERIENCE. EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE PAYING OUT SOME MONEY FOR REINSURERS RATES ACTUALLY GOT THAT BUILD UP OF. LOOTING MORE OF THE LOSSES THEN THE INSURER ACTUALLY PAID. AND THAT HELPS THE INSURER PAY FOR THE REINSURANCE BUT IT KEEPS IT ON A DIRECT BASIS AND TRANSPARENT TO THE CONSUMER OF THE CONSUMER GROUP AND EVERYONE OF. YOU KNOW WHERE THE WHAT THE BASIS OF THE RATE IS BASED ON LOS EXPERIENCE AN ACTUAL EXPENSES. PERRANCE YOU'LL HEAR FROM REINSURANCE PERSON I BET IT CAN BE VERY MARKET DRIVEN DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH MONEY HAS. LOAD INVESTMENT MONEY INTO THE REINSURANCE MARKET OR HASN'T AT ANY GIVEN TIME. SO IT'S A TOUGH THING TO PUT INTO A REGULATED MARKET. THANK YOU CAN I INTERJECT ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT AT A TIME WHEN WE HAVE ANOTHER PANEL AND WE WILL FOCUS ON THE FOR PLAN SPECIFICALLY NEXT I HEARING SO WE'RE GOING TO GET AN OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER OR ASK ALL THOSE QUESTIONS. BUT I JUST HAVE A REALLY QUICK QUESTION WALL. OUT FIRST. KATHLEEN I'M SORRY I DIDN'T. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OKAY. I JUST REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE THANK THAT THE COMMISSIONER I KNOW THAT YOU MENTIONED HOW TWENTY TOWN HALL MEETINGS- AND YOU KNOW THAT'S COMMENDABLE. COMMENDABLE HE'S OUT THERE HEARING FROM PEOPLE DIRECTLY CAN YOU SHARE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE AREAS HE COVERED AS A- TEST A DAY WHERE THE VICTIMS ARE DID HE GO ACROSS THE STATE CAN SURE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN REGIONS. IN TERMS OF THE CONCERNS. THE CHALLENGES. MAN WITH. BUT I'VE BEEN TO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE SIGNAL REALLY OUT HERE AND CATHERINE TORUS WITH ME ALSO WE'VE BEEN TO THESE WEEK WE'VE BEEN REALLY ALL OVER THE STATE AS FAR FROM LOOMIS COUNTY N. SIERRA COUNTY WE WERE JUST IN MALIBU- IN VENTURA HAD BOTH A- LISTENING WORKSHOP ON RATES BUT ALSO A CLEANS WORKSHOP FOR PEOPLE THERE WE'VE BEEN A EL DORADO COUNTY AND PLASTER COUNTY. SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY WE HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE STATE AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS IT'S NOT JUST THE SIERRA FOOTHILLS THAT ARE HAVING THESE ISSUES BUT SO YOU KNOW IT'S IN PARTS OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY BASICALLY EVERY COUNTY IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE OTHER THAN OUR AGRICULTURAL VALLEY. HAS SOME COMPONENT OF THE COUNTY THAT IS HAVING DIFFICULTIES WITH INSURANCE BUT WE WILL BE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY AND SAN MATTEO COUNTY INOTES VERY POP URBAN AREA. THAT AS YOU MOVE UP THE HILLSIDES IN ANY ANYWHERE AROUND THE BAY AREA YOU GET IN YOU. CAN YOU PLEASE- IF WE CAN ONLY BE A FOR THE SECOND TIME CAN YOU- AT LEAST A SHARE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU SEE ACROSS THE STATE WHAT WOULD YOU SEE THAT THE SAME FOR OR WHAT'S DIFFERENT ACROSS REGIONS. A SENATOR BOAR JUST ACTUALLY MENTIONED OF A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT HAD TO COME UP IT'S PEOPLE WORRIED ABOUT THE VALUE OF THEIR HOME. A WHETHER THEY'RE COMMUNITY WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD TOGETHER AND A IN OUT ROUTE IT FLOWS DOWN TO THE SCHOOLS TO THE PROPERTY VALUES THE TAX BASE. SO THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE HEARING FROM THE LOCAL OFFICIALS FOR THE FAMILIES IT'S ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OF THEIR HOME. AND YOU KNOW BEING ABLE TO PAY BOTH THAT IN OTHER HOME LOAN AND NOW THIS ESCALATING PREMIUM THAT THEY DIDN'T ANTICIPATE WHEN THEY BOUGHT THE HOME. AND IS A IS A MISTER MARTINEZ MENTION WE HEAR FROM REALTORS THAT SAY THEY'VE HAD. SALES FALL THROUGH BECAUSE PERSON GETS A BIT ON THE WHAT THEIR INSURANCE WILL BE FINE CELLS CAN BE TOO HIGH AND THEN SAYS NO I DON'T WANT TO BUY THIS PROPERTY I'M GONNA LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO THE THESE ARE THE SAME ISSUES AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED THAT WE'RE HEARING. PRETTY MUCH EVERYWHERE WE GO. AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR. SINCE YOU BROUGHT THE UP YOU. THE A TWENTY. AND I JUST WANT HOW DO YOU THINK IT'S WORKING AND IS THERE. LOOPHOLES THAT YOU'RE FINING WHERE PEOPLE ARE NOT BEING INSURED. I WOULD SAY YES THEY MENTIONED OF COURSE THAT WAS THE FIRST ONE OF PRESSING THE PAUSE BUTTON AND- I MEAN I'D SAY WITH WITH ANYTHING- IT WAS IT WAS OBVIOUSLY BRAND THERE IS SOMETHING THAT WE JUST RECENTLY HAD IMPLEMENTED- AND NOW CURRENTLY OVER ONE MILLION HOMEOWNERS AND A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX THE CODES WOULD SAY. I WOULD SAY ALL IN ALL THAT IT HAS BEEN GOING WELL IN SO FAR OF THAT- IT WE BELIEVE INSURERS HAVE BEEN COMPLIANT WITH WITH WITH THE MANDATORY ASPECT. OF NO NON RENEWAL FOR THAT FOR THIS ENTIRE YEAR I MEAN THAT'S AGAIN AS OF UP TO THE STATE SO. ALL IN ALL THAT WE BELIEVE THAT- WE'VE BEEN IN COMMUNICATION WITH INDUSTRY OF THE- AND ON THIS THE MANDATORY MORATORIUM AND SO IMPLEMENTATION. AGAIN IS FOR THE FIRST TIME I'VE OF COURSE AS WE MOVE FORWARD- INTERESTED TO HEAR IF THERE'S BEEN ANY- CONCERNS ON WITH IT WITH. THE HOMEOWNERS AND WITH- INDUSTRY AS TO- WAYS AND TO IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATION WE BELIEVE ALL AND ALL THAT IT HAS BEEN. IT HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE. THANK YOU FOR SHARING- AND I HAVE A ANOTHER QUESTION- FOR YOU BUT- THIS PERTAINS TO JOE SOMETHING YOU SAID EARLIER YOU SAID JOB FOR ALREADY HAVING A VERY DIFFICULT TIME BEING ABLE TO FOR THE FAIR PLAN AND DIAL. AND I KNOW THEY GET HOW HAVE A LAWSUIT GOING ON SO AS MUCH AS YOU CAN SHARE- MY CONCERN HAD BEEN THE HOT- MANDATING MORE COVERAGE FROM THE FAIR PLAN. DOES NOT CONCERN THE DEPARTMENT THAT DID CAN COME EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE AND MORE AFFORDABLE. CAN YOU SHARE. IT IS CERTAINLY. SO IT'S A LITTLE A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT BASICALLY THE. OBLIGATED BY A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY FROM THE FAIR PLAN THEY STILL HAVE THE OPTION OF BUYING A FIRE POLICY WHICH WOULD BE. CHEAPER POSSIBLY. BUT THE OTHER ISSUE IS MOST CONSUMERS WANT TO HAVE MORE THAN JUST A FIRE COVERAGE SO WHAT THEY'RE HAVING TO DO IS BUY A FIRE POLICY FROM THE FAIR PLAN. AND THEN THE DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY FROM A ONE OF THE ADMITTED INSURERS. THEY'RE PAYING THE EXPENSE LOADING ON THAT DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICY WITH THE ADMITTED STUDENTS FOR THEIR PLAYING THE EXPENSE LOADING ON THE- FIRE POLICY WITH THE FAIR PLAN. OTHER THAN A DOUBLE PAYING FOR A BIG PIECE OF. OF EXPENSES IT REALLY ISN'T HELPING THEM. HAVE MORE COVERAGE. HE SINGLE HAVING THE ABILITY TO BUY A SINGLE POLICY GETS RID OF THE DOUBLE EXPENSE LOADING AND IT WOULD JUST BE AN OPTION THEY COULD THEY STILL HAVE THE OPTION TO GO THE FIRE POLICY. THEY DIDN'T CARE ABOUT HE OTHER VERY IMPORTANT COVERAGES BUT COULD ONLY AFFORD THE FIRE POLICY THE COULD TO SET. I HAVE A QUESTION TO IRAQ'S I ALSO HEARD YOU SAY EARLIER THAT ARE YOU THINK A LONG TERM SOLUTION IS RESTORING THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. WITHOUT DISRUPT WHAT YOU PERCEIVED TO BE A SOLUTION HOW LONG TERM SOLUTION WELL CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THE LONG TERM SOLUTION AND I THINK IT IN EVEN MY PREPARED REMARKS I MENTIONED THAT THE FAIR PLAN IS NEVER A LONG TERM. SOLUTION NOW THE ASSERTION THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS THAT IT HAS MADE THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S THIS SAVINGS BECAUSE OF ELIMINATION OF DUAL ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THEY'VE NOT ONCE PRODUCE ANY NUMBERS TO BACK THAT UP AND- IN FACT ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS RELATED TO DIFFERENCE IN CONDITIONS POLICIES ARE DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT. DRAMATICALLY LOWER THAN THE ADMINISTRATIVE COTS OF THE FAIR PLAN SIMPLY BECAUSE THESE ARE GIGANTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES TO HAVE AFICIONADO ATION SO. WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD% TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS ANALYSIS OF. OF HOW AN H. O. THREE POLICY WOULD ACTUALLY BE FOR THROUGH THE FAIR PLAN. WOULD ACTUALLY BE CHEAPER THAN THE FAIR PLAN PLUS A D. I SEE BELIEVE THIS. SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT ANALYSIS I BELIEVE THE FAIR PLAN HAS ELISE COMMENCED THAT TYPE OF ANALYSIS BUT I DON'T. REPRESENT THEM SO THEY'LL THEY'LL I'M SURE BE INTERESTED TO LET YOU KNOW THEIR ANALYSIS BUT- WE CERTAINLY DON'T SEE THAT THE NOTION THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S NATURE THREE FAIR PLAN THAT'S GOING TO BE LESS EXPENSIVE. THAN THE EXISTING WIDELY AVAILABLE THE ICY POLICIES. WHEN I SAY THE SOLUTION IS TO RESTORE THE VOLUNTARY MARKET. WELL THE AVERAGE PRICE FOR HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA IS A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. AND A FAIR PLAN POLICY WOULD SAY LET'S BE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS JUST FOR FIRE ONLY RIGHT NOT EVEN THE FULL H. A THREE POLICY. I'LL WE NOT BE FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THE VIOLIN. MARK EVEN IF IT GOES UP. AND 15% EVEN IF WE WOULD GO UP TO THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WHICH WOULD BE 17% WHICH IS WE'RE PRESENTLY 17% BELOW THE NATIONAL AVERAGE COST EVEN THOUGH WE'RE A HIGH COST RECONSTRUCTION STATE. THE ABILITY OF THE ADMITTED MARKET TO COME BACK WITH A LEVEL OF RATE ADEQUACY YOU EVEN AT HIGHER THAN IT IS NOW IS STILL DRAMATICALLY NOT EVEN CLOSE. BETTER THAN RELYING UPON THE FAIR PLAN WHY ARE WE ALLOWING PEOPLE TO HAVE NO ADMITTED MARKET OPTION IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND JUST SAYING WELL. GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE FAIR PLAN THAT'S THE WORST THING WE CAN DO FOR THEM THE BEST THING WE CAN DO IS TO HAVE IT ADMITTED MARKET PRICE THAT ALLOWS INSURANCE COMPANIES TO COMPETE IN EVERY OMMUNITY. THAT IS WHAT WE NEED NOT SOME RELIANCE UPON THE FAIR PLAN. WELL ABOVE THE FIRST AND I ALSO JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR HERE-THE REASON I HAVE SO MANY OF YOU KNOW QUESTIONS AND CREE AUSSIE I HAPPEN TO CULTURE THE ENERGY AN ENTRANCE STABILITY WORKING GROUP. WITH CENTER MCGUIRE WE'VE BEEN WORKING SINCE. NOVEMBER AND HAVING DIFFERENT HEARINGS AND JUST SAY LISTEN TO ALL SIDES AND I THINK THAT. NOW THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IS COMMITTED TO PROTECTING CONSUMERS AND MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE INSURANCE AND WE HAPPEN TO REPRESENTS SIMILAR COMMUNITY SO. SO I THINK EVERYONE'S TRYING TO FIND THE ANSWER AND IT'S HERE SOMEWHERE AND US SO. I'M REALLY- THANKFUL THAT YOU'RE ALL HERE TRYING TO GIVE US BOTH SIDES- BUT I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION AND- AND IT PERTAINS TO RACHEL THREE INSURANCE- BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I'VE EXPRESS AND AGAIN I KNOW THAT YOU'RE GOING T LITIGATION AND PLEASE TELL ME A FIVE. WHAT YOU CAN TELL ME WHAT WHAT YOU CANNOT. IF THEY DO. ALL THE ENSURE. YOU KNOW AND I ASKED THIS QUESTION PREVIOUSLY- MY CONCERN IS THAT NOW THEY HAVE TO FOCUS ON A WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. AND LAST TIME IS THAT YOU COULD AND SHARE CAN YOU SHARE NOW HOLD THAT IT'S GOING TO IMPACT THE WAY THE FAIR PLAN DOES BUSINESS. THE OKAY WELL I THINK I CAN ANSWER THAT SO THAT THE FAIR PLAN GENERALLY USES OUTSIDE ADJUSTERS TO. IN A DO THE DAY TO DAY WORK OF- INSPECTING AND CLAIMS AND DETERMINING PAYMENT. AND WORKERS COMP THE BILL THE PIECE OF WENT WORKERS COMPENSATION CALLED REFER TO IS INCIDENTAL WORKERS COMP IS A VERY LOW LEVEL LOSS RATIO I MEAN IT IT IS TYPICALLY MAY BE A FIFTEEN DOLLAR PIECE OF YOUR HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. SO THERE ARE VERY FEW LOSSES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS IS IN OF SOMEBODY THAT. DOESN'T REGULARLY WORK FOR YOU AS AN EMPLOYEE BUT COMES ON YOUR PROPERTY TO DO SOME KIND OF WORK. BEING INJURED. IT'S EXTREMELY RARE SO IT. THE INCIDENT ALL WORKERS COMP IS NOT REALLY A GENERATOR OF MUCH WORKLOAD. THE LIABILITY PIECE IS SUPER IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE. MOST PEOPLE DON'T GO OUT AND BUY A D. I. C. OR A LIABILITY POLICY EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD. IT IT CAN HAVE A CATASTROPHIC LOSS BUT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS ARE RELATIVELY LOW. GENERALLY ON HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE. SO IT'S THE SMALLER PART OF THE PRICE AND OF A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. IT'S JUST VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE BEEN GIVEN HW LITTLE PEOPLE KINDA KNOW ABOUT INSURANCE MANY DON'T KNOW TO GO BY THAT D. IC OR BY THE LIGHT A LIABILITY POLICY. SO IT'S MORE WORK FOR THE FAIR PLAN DEFINITELY BUT THEY ARE GOING TO BE GETTING THE COMPLETE PREMIUM OF AN H. O. THREE POLICY. TO PAY FOR THE EXPENSES OF THE COVERAGES THAT THEY'LL BE OFFERING. WELL AND JUST TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE LIKE I SAID I'VE HEARD SO MUCH OF THIS INFORMATION ALREADY AND I KNOW WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE FOR A PLAN NEXT TIME BUT- WHEN THEY SAID- THAT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN AND DISCUSS HI HAVING TO IMPLEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE TO BE ABLE TO OFFER THIS KIND OF COVERAGE FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WELL AND AGAIN YOU KNOW I GOT THAT INFORMATION IN A REPORT. THE AVERAGE COST PER- CONSUMER IS GOING TO BE AROUND THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS THE COST THAT'S GONNA GOAL HI SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT FIFTEEN DOLLARS NOT BEING A BIG DEAL FOR THIS TYPE OF INSURANCE BUT- BUT THEN THEY HAVE TO UPSET OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND- HIGHER THE PEOPLE AND- AND OF THAT'S GONNA COST THE RATES TO GO UP. THIS WAS NOT JUST A FIFTEEN DOLLARS IT'S BUT COSTS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO. PASS ON TO CONSUMER. WELL IT COULD BE AT THE A COST TO THE INDUSTRY SO WHEN THE FAIR PLAN WAS PUT IN PLACE RIGHT WE DECIDED THAT THE STATE HAD A CRISIS OF COVERAGE IT WAS GENERALLY FOR PEOPLE IN INNER CITIES AND THE INDUSTRY WAS WRITING BUSINESS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BUT CHOSE NOT TO WRITE PEOPLE IN THESE PARTS OF OUR CITIES IN CALIFORNIA OAKLAND RICHMOND EAST LA AND TO GET THAT ROLLING AYE THERE WAS AN ASSESSMENT TO THE INDUSTRY TO GET IT MOVING FORWARD I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S NECESSARY NOW THE FAIR PLAN ACTUALLY. IT IS BUILDING A SURPLUS NOW THEY HAVE INCREASED THEIR RATES IN A THEY HAVE SUFFERED SEVERE LOSSES BUT WHETHER THEY NEED TO DO AN ASSESSMENT TO ACTUALLY. CREATE THIS INFRASTRUCTURE I'D I DON'T THINK THAT'S NECESSARILY SO AND I WOULDN'T NECESSARILY RELY ON THE NUMBERS THEY'VE SHARED IN TERMS OF THE COST WE HAVEN'T REALLY LOOKED AT WHAT THAT WOULD BE. BUT IF YOU DETERMINE THAT PEOPLE HAVE A NEED FOR THIS COVERAGE. THEN IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY PROTECTS YOUR COMMUNITY YOU YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE OF MALE MEN GOING ON TO A PROPERTY DOESN'T HAVE INSURANCE OR OR PARTNERS GOING ON OR WORKMEN. AND THEN FINDING THE PERSON HAS NO LIABILITY COVERAGE IN A WORKERS COMP COVERAGE. IT IS IN CENTRAL IT'S WHY EVERYBODY THAT'S VICE COVERAGE IN THE ADMITTED MARKET BUYS A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY THEY DON'T BY A FIRE POLICY IF THEY CAN HELP BUT- THE PEOPLE WANT HOMEOWNERS. AND WE THINK THE INDUSTRY IS TURNING AWAY PEOPLE FROM BUYING A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY. WHY NOT OFFER THEM A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY IN THE FAIR PLAN. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS OR I'M JUST GONNA LET REX IF YOU WANT TO ADD TO THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO CONVINCE DIFFICULT TO HEAR THAT STATEMENT I MEAN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE IS ESTABLISH A PRICING LEVEL AND THEN WANTS TO ACT AS IF THE- NORMAL REACTION WHICH IS A RESTRICTION OF UNDERWRITING ASSIST PRICE TO THEM. SO IT'S JUST A POLICY CHOICE. IF THE DEPARTMENT WANTS TO KEEP RATE LEVELS WHERE THEY ARE THERE IS AN OBVIOUS IN AFFABLE REACTION IF YOU REDUCE THE PRICE OF SOMETHING YOU'RE GOING TO GET LESS OF A SUPPLY OF SOMETHING. SO OF COURSE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF SELLING HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE AND THEY GO TO GREAT LENGTHS TO MARKET ESTABLISHES SHOULD BE XIN NETWORKS AND YOU CAN'T. FIND A LITTLE LEAGUE BASEBALL FANS IN THE ENTIRE STATE THAT DOESN'T HAVE SOME INSURANCE AGENTS NAME ON IT. SO OF COURSE THEY WANT TO BE OUT THERE SELLING INSURANCE. SO THE ANSWER IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE VOLUNTARY MARKET CAN. AND THAT PEOPLE WOULD EVEN HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT DO I NEED TO DE I SEE POLICY OR WHAT'S GOING TO BE THE COST OF THE FAIR PLAN THE ANSWER IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET IS VIBRANT. AND THAT WE JUST GET TO A NORMALIZED PROPS BECAUSE OVER TIME WE JUST SIMPLY FALLEN BEHIND IN OUR TRYING TO CATCH UP. AND IF I DON'T CATCH UP SOON THERE'S JUST TO BE MORE AVAILABILITY ISSUES UNTIL WE DO. OKAY THANK YOU AND I JUST WANT TO THANK. I KNOW THAT IT'S A LOT OF. AND A LOT OF. MY IF WE'RE GONNA. COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS WE REALLY. TO HAVE THIS ROBUST DEBATE. AND SO MISTER MORE LIKE I'M SORRY YOU WANT ONE MORE QUESTION. YES OKAY SO WE'RE GONNA LET HIM JUST ONE MORE QUESTION AND- AND THE WE'RE GONNA. GO TO THE NEXT PANEL THIS FIRST EVER TO VENTURE WE SHOULD THANK MR. FRAZIER AND HIS INDUSTRY FOR THIS PAUSE BUTTON- FOR WHEN WE ANSWERED OURSELVES AS GOVERNMENT IN THE MARKETPLACE. GETS RATHER AWKWARD- AND SO. WE'RE SEEING IT IN OTHER AREAS INCLUDING ENERGY. WERE KIND OF INSERTING OURSELVES IN EVERYBODY'S RATES ARE GOING UP. SO UP. I WANT TO THANK YOU- BUT I ALSO WANT TO. ASK THE DIRTY QUESTION AND THAT IS- BECAUSE OF THESE WILL BE AREAS IT CETERA. ARE WE SEEING- SOME KIND OF MIGRATION INTO OTHER. AREAS OF THE STATE WERE WERE. SEEING THEM SUBSIDIZE. INSURANCE POLICIES IN IN THESE AREAS I JUST WANT TO. KIND OF ASK THE DIRTY QUESTION YEAH I MEAN IT'S A DIFFICULT. QUESTION RIVER A RIGHT THERE'S A RISK TO DOING THAT- BECAUSE IF YOU ESTABLISH TO LOW OF A PRICE IN A HIGH RISK. AREA OFFSET IT. WITH TO HAVE A PRICE AND LOWER RISK AREA THEN YOU'LL GET OUT COMPETED IN THE LOW RISK AREA. SO IT'S DIFFICULT SO THE MARK GENERALLY WOULD DISSUADE THAT TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. IT'S NOT TO SAY IT. CAN'T EXIST- BUT AT THIS POINT- YOU'D HAVE TO LOOK AT EACH COMPANY AND FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE HANDLING THAT- YOU KNOW IF COMPANIES COULD. STAY IN HIGH RISK AREAS BY BRINGING IN- PREMIUM FROM OTHER AREAS THAT WOULD IT WOULD BE GREAT FOR THEM BUT I THINK IT'S- VERY DIFFICULT. TO ACCOMPLISH THAT OKAY. AT AND I DON'T GIVE A LESSON NOT THIRTY SECONDS BECAUSE WE NEED ON. WORDS IN MISTER ROGERS MOUTH BUT I THINK WE JUST HEARD HIM SUGGEST AS WHEN YOU ASKED ABOUT THE FAIR PLAN THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THAT ARRESTED IT'D BE PRETTY EXORBITANT FOR THEM TO IMPLEMENT AN H. O. THREE- AND THEN I THINK YOU SUGGESTED WELL YOU COULD HAVE INDUSTRY JUST PAY FOR THEM TO DO THAT. AND IN MY MIND THAT IS IN AN S. AND SAYING WELL LET'S SUBSIDIZE THE FAIR PLAN EFFORT THERE BY PUTTING A SHIFTING ACOSTA WERE THE ADMITTED MARKET WHICH WOULD THEN BE. SUBSIDIZING THAT EFFORT OVER THERE SO WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO CONCLUDE THIS PANEL AT JACK YOU KNOW I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYONE THAT'S HAD. THAT'S BEEN VERY PATIENTS BUT I REALLY NEED IT- EVERYONE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS THANK YOU TO BOTH OF YOU AND PLEASE SEND MY REGARDS TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THANK YOU. NEXT I WANT TO CALL OUR POUND- NUMBER TWO WHICH WILL FOCUS ON TOOLS FOR MANAGING RISK EXPOSURE. SO WE HAVE WITH US TODAY- DENNIS BURKE VICE PRESIDNT OF STAY RELATIONS FROM THE RE INSURANCE ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. AS WELL AS ROGER. I HOPE I FIT RIGHT GRAY NEAR. PHD SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT FROM GLOBAL RESILIENCE PRACTICE LEADER AIR WILL WORLDWIDE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND I'M I THINK UT. CARE ACROSS IS ALSO GOING TO JOIN IN CASE THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS I THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I'M GOING TO- KEEP IT A LITTLE BIT MORE CAN DANCE AND DOES ALLOW YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH US A LOT ABOUT THE MARKET AND JUST. PHYLLIS IN AND- WE HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT YOUR MARKET US. IS THIS ON YES HI OUT. I'M DENNIS BURKE FROM THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR- HEARING HAVING US HERE TODAY IN HEARING OUR PERSPECTIVE. I'M GOING TO TRY TO BE PETTY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WAY AND LEAVE AS MUCH TIME FOR QUESTIONS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE BECAUSE IF I TRY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS UP FRONT WILL BE HERE FOREVER- SO WHAT IS RE INSURANCE REINSURANCE IS INSURANCE FOR INSURANCE COMPANY. IT'S A PRUDENT RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL THAT HELPS INSURANCE RIGHT MORE BUSINESS ON THE SAME SURPLUS. IT HELPS THEM MANAGE THEIR EXPOSURES AT THE SAME TIME AND IT HELPS THEM KEEP THEIR PROMISES TO THAT POLICY HOLDERS. WHAT REINSURANCE DOES NOT DO IS IT DOESN'T CHANGE THE RISK AT ALL. SO THE RISK OF WILDFIRE DOESN'T CHANGE BECAUSE YOU HAVE INSURANCE AND RISK OF WILDFIRE DOESN'T CHANGE. BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS REINSURANCE. EVERY INSURANCE DOES IS IT CHANGES WHO PAYS PART OF THE LOS. AND WHAT'S GOOD ABOUT THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY IS WE ARE A GLOBAL INDUSTRY WE SPREAD THE RISK THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND WHEN THERE IS A CATASTROPHIC FIRE. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WILL GET AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS FROM THE MONEY COMING FROM. GLOBAL POCKET BOOKS AND THE CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE THEIR CLAIMS PAID. THE GLOBAL MARKET IS HUGE WE ARE COMPETING AS THE REINSURANCE COMPANIES AGAINST OF THE REINSURANCE COMPANIES AND AGAINST THE CAPITAL MARKETS WHO HAVE FOUND THAT INSURANCE LINKED SECURITIES WHICH IS BASICALLY A MEANS OF THE INSURANCE THE CAPITAL MARKETS PENSION FUNDS ETCETERA COMPETING IN THE REINSURANCE MARKET. IS IN THE TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO WE HAVE THIS. NO SHORTAGE OF CAPACITY THERE IS AMPLE CAPACITY FOR THE RISK. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH RISK IS THERE. AND THAT TURNS US TO WILD FIRES SO THE FIRST THING YOU HAVE A CHART IN FRONT OF YOU I HOPE. WHICH IS HAS. ZERO ATTRIBUTION ON IT I WILL TELL YOU- WHAT THAT IS- AFTER A DISCUSSION YESTERDAY SOMEBODY I WAS ASKED YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE HISTORY OF WILDFIRE LOSS IN CALIFORNIA AND I FOUND A MUNICH RE CHART- THAT HAD THE ENTIRE NATION ON S. BUT I SAID YOU HAVE CALIFORNIA SPECIFIC DATA AND I WAS SENT THIS THIS MORNING IT DOESN'T SAY MUNICH RE BY MUNICH RE IS ONE OF THE LARGEST IF NOT THE LARGEST REINSURER IN THE WORLD AND THEY TRACK. NATURAL DISASTER RISKS AND THEY HAVE AN ONLINE DATABASE- THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT BUT WHAT THEY HAVE HERE IS THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE LOSSES SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY. AND THIS INCLUDES COMMERCIAL AS WELL AS RESIDENTIAL BUT I WAS TOLD THAT THE RULE OF THUMB IS 85% OF THESE LOSSES THE REST ARE RESIDENTIAL. SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE IDEA OF YOU AND YOUR SOLELY CONCERNED WITH RESIDENTIAL YEAH. SHOP A LITTLE BIT OFF. WHAT'S TELLING ABOUT THIS CHARGE IS THAT THE YEARS OF TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY DWARF THE THIRTY SIX YEARS PRIOR TO THAT. AND IT'S JUST ABSOLUTELY STARTLING THE DIFFERENCE. AND THE QUESTION IS HISTORY STILL APPROPRIATE. TO EVALUATE WHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BRING IS THERE A NEW NORMAL DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE. THAT THE POLICY% QUESTION THAT'S THE UNDERWRITING QUESTION THAT'S THE RISK THAT WE IN THE INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE INDUSTRIES ALL GRAPPLING WITH AS WE TRY TO DEVELOP- INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE PORTFOLIOS ON A FORWARD LOOKING BASIS BECAUSE WE'RE ACTUALLY. PRICING NOW FOR WHAT THE NEXT YEAR WILL BRING. SO WHAT SHOULD YOU DO AS POLICY MAKERS THE ONE THING YOU SHOULD DO IS CONTINUE YOUR RISK REDUCTION EFFORTS- THE REDUCTION OF WILDFIRE FUELS THE TAKING DOWN OF AS MANY- DEAD TREES AS POSSIBLE AND CONTINUING TO DO IT BECAUSE IT'S A MAINTENANCE THING- THE- WILD WILD GRASSES AND- AND TREES GROW IF YOU DON'T. ROUTINELY MAINTAIN- THOSE AREAS SO WE NEED TO DO THAT WE NEED TO ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE THE- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS PART WITH THE FOR THE FEDERAL WILDLIFE SINCE- WE NEED TO JUST CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE- DATE THE FUELS AS POSSIBLE AND WE NEED TO EVALUATE HOW AND WHERE WE BUILD- I BHS WHICH IS THE INDUSTRY'S. OF RESILIENCY EFFORT TO DETERMINE WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO BUILD HOMES IS FOCUSING VERY VERY MUCH- WILDFIRE ACTUALLY SAW ONE OF THEIR WILD FIRE PRESENTATIONS LINES- IT REALLY THEY THEY HAVE A WILDFIRE GENERATOR AND THEY CREATE AN EMBER STORM. AND THEY SHOOT IT AT TO THAT HOUSE THAT'S BILL TWO WAYS A CONVENTIONAL HOUSE AND EIGHTY A BETTER DEVELOPED HOUSE- AND THE BETTER DEVELOPED HOUSE DOES MUCH BETTER- SO. HOW YOU BUILD IN WAY YOU BILLS VERY IMPORTANT- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- CONSUMER THAT INDIVIDUAL HOME MITIGATION IS NOT. AS GOOD AS INDIVIDUAL HOME MITIGATION AND COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION SO TO COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND FINAL. I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU NOT TO INTERFERE WITH THE PRIVATE MARKET TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE I RECOGNIZE THIS A LOT OF SOCIAL POLICY ISSUES THAT EVERYBODY NEEDS TO ADDRESS TO THE EXTENT YOU CAN KEEP SOCIAL PROP POLICY OUT OF THE ECONOMICS OF THE INDUSTRY- IT'S BETTER. FRAZIER DID A WONDERFUL JOB OF EXPLAINING HOW- SUPPRESSING RATES INTERFERES WITH THE WILLINGNESS OF CAPITAL TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET SO I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO DO WHATEVER YOU CAN TO ATTRACT ADDITIONAL CAPITAL SO THEY CAN HELP. DIVERSIFY THE RISK OVER IS MANY BALANCE SHEETS AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU FOR THAT- AND ON SOMETHING LIKE WE ARE HERE OFTEN AND DIE WAS REALLY INTERESTING TO JUST TO HEAR HOW WHAT HAPPENS SORT OF WORLDWIDE IMPACTS WHAT WE DO HERE SO NOW I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER. TO OUGHT TO ROGER AND- TRYING KEEP IT BRIEF IF YOU COUNT THANK YOU. ZAHN OKAY- I WILL TRY AND KEEP IT BRIEF WHICH IT RUBIO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS ROGER GRENIER A AND M. SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AT A AYE OUR WORLDWIDE. WERE MAJOR PROVIDER OF CATASTROPHE MODELS FOR THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. I WANNA START THINKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. ABOUT THE WILD CARD CHALLENGES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IN A PARTICULAR Y. CATASTROPHE MODELS ARE AN IMPORTANT AND NECESSARY COMPONENT PROCESSING WILDFIRE RISK. OUR GOAL IS A COMPANIES TO HELP SOCIETY PREPARE FOR THE IMPACT OF CATASTROPHES BEFORE THEY OCCUR. WE ARE PLEASED TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION TOWARDS DEVELOPING SOLUTIONS TO BENEFIT RESIDENTS AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. IN A FEW MINUTES I HAVE TODAY LIKE TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE OUR MODELS AND THE VALUE THEY PROVIDE- BUT FIRST A PROVIDE A SHORT HISTORY. PRIOR TO HURRICANE ANDREW IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO INSURERS MADE ASSUMPTIONS- EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYED RULES OF THUMB. LARGELY BASED ON HIS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. ESTIMATE TE SIZE OF A POTENTIAL LOSS FROM A LARGE EVENT. THE CONSENSUS OPINION WAS A CATEGORY FIVE HURRICANE IN SOUTH FLORIDA COULD CAUSE. AT MOST A FIVE BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY LOS. UNFORTUNATELY HURRICANE ANDREW EXPOSE THE FAR ON THAT APPROACH AFTER THE INDUSTRY SUFFERED A FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLAR LOSS IN THE EVENT. SEVERAL INSURERS BECAME INSOLVENT IN MANY STRUGGLE TO PAY CLAIMS AFT PRECIPITATING INSURANCE CRISIS IN THE STATE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THE NINETEEN NINETY FOUR NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE PROVIDERS SIMILAR WAKE UP CALL. UNDERLINING THE LIMITATIONS OF SOLELY RELYING ON HISTORICAL LOS EXPERIENCE SINCE THAT TIME THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY NOT RELIES HEAVILY ON CATASTROPHE MODELS IN ASSESSING EARTHQUAKE RISK. OUR COMPANY FOUNDED NINETEEN EIGHTY NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN WAS THE FIRST TO APPLY SCIENCE IN DATA TO THE PROBLEM. CATASTROPHE MODELS HAVE NOW BECOME THE STANDARD APPROACH FOR MEASURING AND MANAGING THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF EXTREME EVENTS INCLUDING WHILE FAR. pSOLVING IS ONE OF ESTIMATING LAWSON VERY LOW FREQUENCY BUT VERY HIGH SEVERITY EVENTS THE TYPE OF EVENTS THE CAN CAUSE A COMPANY TO GO INSOLVENT AND WE POLICY HOLDERS WITHOUT PROTECTION AT A TIME WHEN THEY NEED IT MOST. THE EVENTS ARE RARE IN THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING FOR THESE EVENTS RELYING ON LOSS HISTORY AS IS DONE IN THE CALIFORNIA PROPERTY INSURANCE MARKET IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH. IN THIS WAY THE MODELS AUGMENT AND EFFECTIVELY EXTEND THE AVAILABLE LOS EXPERIENCE. HEY OURS WHILE FARMALL STARTS WITH AN OBJECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE LANDSCAPE A PROPENSITY TO BURN. CONSIDERING A REGION SPECIFIC ASSESSMENT OF THE VEGETATIVE FUELS THE SLOPE ROAD ACCESS. AND HOMES AND BUSINESSES OF AND MAPPED ONTO THE SURFACE. THE MODEL BEGINS BY CREATING A TECHNICIAN. AND THEN SIMULATING THE EFFECTS OF WIND AND WEATHER. FIRE SPREAD. FIRE SUPPRESSION. IN THE PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE STRUCTURES. THE MODEL CONSIDERS THE IMPACT ON THE FUEL LOAD FOR MULTI YEAR CYCLES OF RAIN FALLING DROUGHT. CREATING A CATALOG OF EVENTS THAT ARE PHYSICALLY REALISTIC IN STATISTICALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE HISTORICAL RECORD. THE MODEL SIMULATES A YEAR'S WORTH OF WILDFIRE ACTIVITY MANY THOUSANDS OF TIMES INCLUDING EVENTS THAT HAVE NOT YET OCCURRED BUT COULD OCCUR. IN ADDITION THE WHAT THE MODEL FILLS A CRITICAL GAP IN THE HISTORICAL RECORD. BUT CONSIDERING HOW FIRES THAT OCCURRED MANY YEARS AGO WENT UNDEVELOPED AREAS MIGHT IMPACT TODAY'S EXPOSURE. HEY OUR SERVICE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR BY PROVIDING REALISTIC AN OBJECTIVE MODELS THAT ENABLE ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND EFFECTIVELY MANAGE RISK. TODAY CATASTROPHE MALLS ARE USED THROUGHOUT THE INSURANCE VALUE CHAIN BY BROKERS AND INSURERS. REINSURERS IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS. THE MODEL RESULTS ARE REGARDED AS THE CURRENCY. FOR CATASTROPHE RESTAURANTS FOR. IN A VERY RECENT AND RELEVANT EXAMPLE AIRS WHILE FARM ALWAYS USES ONE INPUT INTO THE DESIGN OF THE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE FUND RECOMMENDED BY SB NINE A ONE COMMISSION AND THE GOVERNOR AND LATER INTRODUCED BY A. B. TEN FIFTY FOUR. ESTIMATES FROM THE MODEL WE USE ALONG WITH THE HISTORICAL DATA IN DETERMINING THE SIZE OF THE FUND. THE MODELS ALSO PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK ON WHICH TO MEASURE IN ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF MITIGATION. CHANGES TO LAND USE AND UPDATES TO BUILDING CODES. ENHANCING THE SCIENCE AND THE DATA THROUGH A PROCESS OF CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT ALLOWS THE MODELS IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO EVOLVE. THIS HELPS TO FILL THE INDUSTRY'S MISSION OF PROVIDING FINANCIAL RESILIENCE TO HOMES BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES. THE KEY FACTOR IN THIS MISSION IS A RECOGNITION THAT THE RISK MUST BE MEASURED IN ORDER TO BE MANAGED. COMPANY SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE MOST RELEVANT TOOLS AVAILABLE TO DEVELOP ACTUAR EARLY SOUND RATES. CURRENTLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT'S INSURANCE REGULATIONS REFLECTED DATED UNDERSTANDING ABILITY OF ANALYTICAL TOOLS SUCH AS CATASTROPHE MODELS. WHAT EARTHQUAKE MODELS CAN BE CONSIDERED AN RATE MAKING. ARE A POSITIVE OUTCOME FOR THE NORTHRIDGE EVENT. MODELS FOR WILDFIRE AND OTHER PARENTS ARE CURRENTLY NOT ALLOWED THIS INTRODUCES AN INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN VARIOUS UNDERWRITING AND RATING ACTIVITIES OF INSURERS IN THE RELATED DOWNSTREAM ASSUMPTION OF RISK BY OTHER ENTITIES. WE RECOMMEND AN APPROACH THAT CONSIDERS THE FULL RANGE OF RISK MANAGEMENT TOOLS RECOGNIZING THAT THIS CAN BE DONE WILL STILL PROTECTING CONSUMER RATE IS CONSUMER RIGHTS AS IS DONE IN MANY OTHER STATES. WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION ON USING THE BEST SCIENCE AVAILABLE- THE BEST SCIENCE AVAILABLE TO ASSESS WILD VIRUS. PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW A. I. R. COULD BE HELPFUL RESOURCE TO THE STATE IS TO MOVE FORWARD IN BUILDING MORE RESILIENT CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU THANK YOU DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SHARE I DON'T THINK I THANK YOU MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS. MR LOOK UP. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I'VE GOT TO LEAVE IN FIVE MINUTES SO I'M GONNA JUMP IN WITH THIS QUESTION SO I GUESS WILL DESCRIBE YOU AS THE MOTHER SHIP. OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. RIGHT YOU ENSURE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES YOU GIVE THEM. THE BENEFIT AND THE RESOURCES. TO BE ABLE TO COME INTO CALIFORNIA. AND DO WHAT THEY DO FOR US ENSURE THE HOMEOWNERS. SURE THE INDUSTRIES THAT WE ALL. OF LOVE AND GET OUR HEARTS BECAUSE WE ARE THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. SO WITH THAT IN MIND ARE YOU- ALSO THINKING THAT- OFFSETTING SOME OF THESE COSTS. IN IN SOME OF THE AREAS THAT ARE NOT AFFECTED BY WATER FIRE- WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE A HISTORY WILD. IN MOVING THOSE CAUGHT UP HOW ARE YOU GOING TO OFFICE THAT IN PROTECT YOUR INSURANCE COMPANIES. WHICH WE CAN BETTER SERVE US. OKAY SO THE FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT- REINSURERS TAKE THEIR ANTI TRUST. OBLIGATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY AND THEY DO NOT DO NOT I MEAN WE SAW AT EVERY MEETING WITH AN ANTI TRUST REMINDER- WE DO NOT DISCUSS PRICING BETWEEN OURSELVES- SO. WE ARE NOT DOING THAT SO I WILL TALK GENERAL GENERAL ECONOMIC- CONCEPTS AND HOW MY UNDERSTANDING IS OF. ABOUT THE INSURANCE PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT THEORIES- SO. TYPICALLY WHEN INSURANCE IS. RIGHT A BEST OF WE JUST TAKE A STEP BACK- WE ARE ALSO- TO CERTAIN EXTENT I HAVE TO DISAGREE WITH THE MOTHER SHIP COMMENT BECAUSE MANY OF THE- INSURANCES ARE BIGGER THAN TO RE ENTERS. SO THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE JUST PROTECTING THEIR- YOU KNOW THEIR BUSINESS BUT THERE THAT THEY'VE BEEN WRITING SO MANY POLICIES ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THERE THEY HAVE THE POTENTIALITY OF WHAT I CALL SPIKE LOSSES THAT. FAR EXCEED THEIR- THEIR EXPECTED LOSSES AND THEIR RISK TOLERANCE SO THEY'LL BUY REINSURANCE TO HELP THEM MANAGE THEIR BOOK BUSINESS. AND AS REINSURER IS WHAT MY MEMBERS TO IS BECAUSE THERE IT'S A GLOBAL BUSINESS THEY BUILD A PORTFOLIO OF RISK WHICH TRIES TO RIGHT. CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE CALIFORNIA WILDFIRE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WIND EXPOSURE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WIND EXPOSURE THE NEW MADRICK FAULT EARTHQUAKE JAPAN EARTHQUAKE JAPAN WINDSTORMS THE PACIFIC EVERYTHING THAT COULD GO WRONG THAT WE WRITE CHILE WE WRITE AUSTRALIA WE WRITE EVERYTHING AND WHAT WE DO IS WE TRIED TO COLLECT ENOUGH PREMIUM. TO PAY FOR LOSSES THAT MAY OCCUR. AND TO PAY FOR EXPENSES AND THEN HAVE A REASONABLE EXPECTATION OF PROCESS SO INSURANCE IS BASED UPON THE THEORY THAT BAD THINGS DON'T HAPPEN TO EVERYBODY AT THE SAME TIME SO WE TRY TO CREATE A POOL OF RISK. THAT FOR NEXT YEAR WILL GIVE US A REASONABLE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PROFIT IT'S NOT THAT WE'RE SAYING I'M GOING TO CHARGE CALIFORNIA EXTRA- SO. IT AND USE. AND MAKE MONEY IN JAPAN THAT'S TRUE THIS IS THE FREQUENTLY IT. THE FACT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE OF THE VALUES THAT WE HAVE HERE- PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET OTHER RISKS TO BALANCE IT OUT SO HEADS- IS COMPETITIVE MARKET AND- TO THE EXTENT THAT WE IN THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY ATTEMPT TO GET A LARGER THAN APPROPRIATE- PROFIT OPPORTUNITY THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN COMMAND VERY EASILY- THE SEATING INSURANCE WHICH IS WHAT WE CALL THEM. THE INSURANCE COMPANY USES WHAT YOU CALL THEM THE THEY USE A- THE EQUIVALENT OF AN AGENT IS CALLED THE RE INSURANCE BROKER. AND THEY WILL GO OUT AND- IF COMPANIES A REINSURANCE COMPANY A WANTS TO CHARGE TOO MUCH THEY'LL GO AND FIND OTHER PEOPLE TO REPLACE THEM ON THE BUT ON THE PROGRAM. THANK YOU THANK YOU MEDICARE. TO ASK QUESTIONS. WITH ONE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I AM REMINDED LISTENING- ON REINSURANCE FOR INSURANCE IN IN ROMAN TIMES- AT THE PORTS- THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULD HAVE BEEN BENCHES AND THEY WOULD INSURE CARGO AND IF THE SHIP DIDN'T COME BACK THEN THE INSURANCE COMPANY WOULD HAVE TO PAY THE MERCHANTS THAT LOST THEIR GOODS IF THE INSURANCE PROVIDER COULD NOT THEN THEIR BENCH WAS BROKEN AND WHERE THEY WERE NOT PERMITTED TO TRANSACT ANY MORE BUSINESS- AND THAT'S WHERE WE GET THE TERM BONTA. RECTUS BANKRUPTCY. AND SO WE HAVE FISCAL TOOLS IN PLACE THAT WE HAVE TO BE VERY MINDFUL AND CAREFUL OF AN ANTI AND WE HAVE RESIDENTS THAT ARE TRYING TO. FIND INSURANCE AND SO WE'VE GOT TO STRIKE A BALANCE WHERE. YOU GET A FAIR COMPENSATION AND OUR TAXPAYERS. PROTECT THEIR MOST IMPORTANT ASSET THEIR HOME- SO. HOW WOULD YOU. HELP ME TO COMMUNICATE TO MY CONSTITUENTS WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING. WELL. ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THEY DID DID PREVIOUSLY- TO RESOLVE BUT AN ISSUE AND I WOULD NOT ENCOURAGE YOU TO GO TO AND THAT THIS PAST BUT WE NEED YES THERE THE CRISIS BECAUSE THEY WERE FAR AWAY FROM THE CRISIS THAT WE HAD AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE- NEAR THE LEGISLATURE FORM THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY AND THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY IS WHAT MADE THAT WORK. NOW WE BACK THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY WHEN IT HAD A LOT OF RISK AND VERY LITTLE MONEY AND WE CONTINUED BACK IS- SO. ONE IT A WE ACTUALLY ARE PART OF MAKING INSURANCE AVAILABLE WHETHER IT'S THROUGH GOVERNMENT FACILITIES OR THROUGH THE PRIVATE MARKETS- ALSO TO THE EXTENT THAT. REINSURANCE DID NOT EXIST INSURERS WOULD NOT EAT WITH THESE IT NOT BE ABLE TO WRITE AS MUCH BUSINESS OR WOULD HAVE TO HOLD A LOT MORE CAPITAL THAN THEY DO TODAY. AND THEN BECAUSE- WHERE A PROFIT DRIVEN. ECONOMY IF THEY HAVE TO HOLD TWICE AS MUCH CAPITAL YOU KNOW THERE INVESTORS ARE GOING TO WANT TO RETURN ON CAPITAL- AND THAT CAPITAL IS IN USE ALL THAT FREQUENTLY. THE REINSURANCE INDUSTRY. BECAUSE WE TAKE RISK ALL. IN WHAT I CALL PEAK RISKS ALL BAD OF EACH EGION AND EACH. CATASTROPHIC PERIL WE USE OUR CAPITAL MORE EFFICIENTLY THAN THEM WHICH ENABLES THEM TO USE THEIR CAPITAL MORE EFFICIENTLY AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU ACTION. THEY KILL AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR COMING JUST TO SHARE A LITTLE BIT- WITH US I KNOW THAT I'VE LEARNED A LOT FROM FOR ME PRIVATELY AND I WANTED EVERYONE TO IT TO HEAR A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT YOU DO SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMING. UP AT THIS POINT OUT YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO CONCLUDE AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENTS THANK YOU SO MUCH ALL OF YOU FOR SHOWING UP. SO AT THIS POINT ANYBODY WISHING TO SPEAK AND PLEASE COME UP TO THE MIKE AND DIE WILL ASK THAT YOU KEEP YOUR COMMENTS BRIEF STATE YOUR NAME AND- YOUR COMMENT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WHAT WAIT FOR THE- I MAY BE LOUD BUT- OKAY WE GET GOOD TO GO THANK YOU HI MY NAME IS AMY BACH AND I'M HERE. ON BEHALF OF THE NONPROFIT CALLED UNITED POLICY HOLDERS WE ARE A NATIONAL FIVE ONCE YOU THREE THAT IS AN INFORMATION RESOURCE AND A VOICE FOR INSURANCE CONSUMERS SO WE ARE- WORK VERY CLOSE TO THE GROUND WE WERE AROUND AFTER THE OAKLAND FIRE WE STARTED IN NINETY ONE. AND ONE OF THE FIRST CHALLENGES THAT WE ENCOUNTERED AFTER THAT DISASTER WAS THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE STARTED GETTING DROPPED IN ON RENEWED BY THEIR INSURERS WE REALIZE OKAY SO THE SEVERITY OF THAT AT THAT TIME IT WAS I THINK THE LARGEST URBAN WILDFIRE AND HID IT COST INSURERS PRETTY PENNY AND HIGH LEVEL EXECUTIVE NOTICED AND SURE ENOUGH THEY SAID WE BETTER- WE BETTER MAYBE ADJUSTS SOME OF OUR- OF OUR CUSTOMER BASE IN THAT AREA. AND WE ARE MY ORGANIZATION GOT TOGETHER WITH THE CITY OF OAKLAND WE LAUNCH SOMETHING CALLED MATCH UP AND WHAT WE DID AT THE TIME WAS JUST FIND VERY PROACTIVE INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS WHO HAD MULTIPLE MARKETS AND JUST CONNECTED UP WITH THE CONSUMER AND THEN THE PEOPLE ARE ABLE REPLACE COVERAGE ON THE CRISIS WENT AWAY. THAT WAS A REALLY IN LESS TO UP ON. HOW THE- HELL A LARGE GUITAR. CAN CAUSE AND- TO HAVE A PATH. REAR AND SO SINCE THAT TIME OVER THESE YEARS WE'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY. TO HELP SOLVE SORT OF THESE MICRO PROBLEMS AND THEN WHEN THE TREE MORTALITY CRISIS HIT IN TWO THOUSAND. SIXTEEN WE HAD TO GET INVOLVED AGAIN- IN AGAIN LOOKING FOR SOLUTIONS AND OUR ORGANIZATION PUTS OUT A COUPLE PUBLICATIONS. THAT YOUR CONSTITUENTS CAN USE ONE CALLED DROP BY OR SURE WHERE TO GO FOR HELP IN CALIFORNIA. TEACHING PEOPLE HAD IT IN THE HERE AND NOW HOW TO FIND WHATEVER OPTIONS MAY BE OUT THERE FOR THEM. EITHER IN THE ADMITTED NOT ADMITTED OR THE FAIR PLAN MARKET WE ALSO HAVE SOME TIPS ON THE FAIR PLAN. THAT WE POLISHED WITH SOME HELP FROM THE FAIR PLAN THEMSELVES TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT WAS IS AS SIMPLE AND CLAIM BUT I THINK AMY WHAT HAVE JUST WRAPPING UP HERE TO WRAP UP HERE OBVIOUSLY- WE DO HAVE A BIG PROBLEM. WE DO NEED SOME COOPERATION FROM ALL SIDES OF WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO RIDE THIS ONE OUT IT'S JUST NOT POSSIBLE. AND YOU YOU KNOW THIS FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND FROM THE REALTORS IN YOUR DISTRICTS. SO WHAT DO WE NEED YOU HEARD MARK A MARTINEZ ARTICULATE. ALMOST EXACTLY WHAT MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN ADVANCING HERE WHICH IS THE MITIGATION PLAN BECAUSE CALL ME A CHRONIC OPTIMIST WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING WE KNOW. THAT YOU'RE A I G. AND USA ARE ALREADY ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE'RE NOT HELPLESS THERE ARE THINGS YOU CAN DO TO MAKE IT LESS LIKELY FOR A HOME TO BURN. THEY ALL RIGHT. THE IS THEIR CUSTOMERS AND REWARD THEIR CUSTOMERS SO THIS BODY NEEDS TO FIGURE OUT. THE CORE OF THE PROBLEM WHAT IS THE REWARD THAT THE HOMEOWNER GAS AND THAT IS THE TRICKY PART. THEY GET. TO BE TO KEEP THEIR INSURANCE DO THEY GET IF THEY'RE ALREADY INSURED. CAN'T DO THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO BUY INSURANCE FROM SOMEBODY OTHER THAN THE FAIR PLAN OR DO THEY GET A PREFERRED ROUTE LIKE A- GOOD. FOR JUST. TO FOR THE CONYERS. A YOU'RE GOING TO IMPOSE SOME SORT OF MANDATE ON INSURANCE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME TO INVOLVE. AND STATE. THAT IS HOW THIS. HER STAY. EVEN THE RED. HAVE HAD JIM SOME SORT OF MANDATORY MEDICATION. RECALL THAT REQUIREMENT THAT THE INSURERS RECOGNIZE IT AND GIVE THE HOMEOWNER SOME KIND OF REPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS NEXT. GOOD AFTERNOON STACY HIT MORAL COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THIRTY SEVEN RURAL COUNTIES- STATEWIDE AND MANY OF THE FOLKS THAT ARE- GOING THROUGH THESE NON RENEWALS ARE IN OUR MEMBER COUNTIES AND SO WE HEAR ABOUT THIS EVERY DAY FROM OUR BOARD- AND WE'RE NOW STARTING TO SEE COMMERCIAL NON RENEWALS IN OUR COUNTIES WE'VE GOTTEN CALLS FROM NEVADA COUNTY THEY'RE SEEING. A COMMERCIAL INSURANCE NON RENEWALS AND THE REASON BEING YOU KNOW HIGH FIRE RISKS SO IT'S NOT JOSS HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE ANYMORE IT'S CREEPING INTO COMMERCIAL INSURANCE THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE SINGLE IT'S FRUSTRATING PROBLEMS THAT WE RUN UP AGAINST IT IN MY MEMORY WITH RC RC. BECAUSE IT DOESN'T LIKE THERE'S ONE GOOD SALUTE AND WE'VE TRIED TO WORK WITH ALL SIDES OF THE ISSUE. WE'VE EVEN ARE A NINE MEMBER HOT AS SUB COULD OF OUR BOARD TO TRY TO SEE WHAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CAN DO FOR COMMUNITY WIDE MITIGATION AND ENFORCING. VINCE'S ON A DEFENSIBLE. I'M HARDLY A HOW CAN HELP CAN HELP. AND YOU KNOW WE JUST CAN TO DO PART AND WORK WITH ALL SIDES AND WE'RE HOPING THAT AS WE LOOK AS  LISTEN TO THE TESTIMONY TODAY AND- IT STILL FEELS LIKE. THE DEPARTMENT AND THE INDUSTRY AR FAR APART ON WHAT THEY THINK SHOULD BE DONE. BUT MAYBE WILL REACH SOME CRITICAL MASS WHERE WE CAN FINALLY GET SOMETHING ROLLING WHERE EVERYBODY STARTS WORKING TOGETHER ON SOME REAL SOLUTIONS. BECAUSE IT'S OUR RESIDENTS THERE GETTING CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF ALL OF THAT SO- WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME IN HAVING THIS HEARING AGAIN TODAY AD WE'RE HOPING THAT. WE CAN ALSO HELP BE PART OF THE SOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. HELLO MY NAME IS PHIL- WHEN I ACTUAR TWO HATS- ONE I'M THE PUBLIC RELATIONS REPRESENTED FOR THE CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN. SO HOLD MOST MY COMMENTS THAT AS YOU INDICATED WILL BE. AT THE NEXT MEETING WILL BE DIGGING DEEPER INTO THE FAIR PLAN. QUESTIONS IN AND THE OTHER HOW TO WHERE I AS I AM A AGENCY OWNER INSURANCE AGENCY OWNER IN- EL DORADO COUNTY. SO I'M HERE. OF THIS BEAST VIEW COMMENTS ON THAT. THE FIRST OFFER THE IS FOR THE FAIR PLAN I JUST WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE NO DO THE COMMENT WAS MADE. OF A DOUBLE EXT. DOUBLE PAYING- DOUBLE EXPENSE LOW THERE IS NO LOAD. SO THAT THAT'S NOT A FACTOR AND THE REALITY IS THAT. THE ROLE OF THE FAIR PLAN IS PLAYING IS FEELING THE NEED THAT IT'S DESIGNED FOR TODAY. THERE'S HUGE BENEFITS FOR THE CONSUMERS. TO HAVE THE D. I. C. POLICIES WITH THE CARRIERS THAT OFFER THEM. THEY GET. BIG DISCOUNT ON THEIR AUTO INSURANCE THE AVAILABILITY OF EXCESS- LIABILITY UMBRELLA POLICIES- AND- MULTIPLE ENDORSEMENTS ARE AVAILABLE. WELL BEYOND JUST LOOKING AT THE LIABILITY COMPONENT THAT THAT CONTINUES TO BE. TO BE BROUGHT UP. ARM AS AS AN AGENT I CAN SAY. IN THE PAST FOURTEEN MONTHS OR SO WHEN THIS REALLY THIS CRISIS REALLY. ERUPTED I- HAVE QUOTED OVER A THOUSAND. CONSUMERS INSURANCE THAT ARE IN THE- CIRCUMSTANCE THAT HAVE HAD TO BE WITH THE FAIR PLAN. IN A DEEP I SEE ONE OF THE AS HE POLICIES. AND THERE'S A ONE PERSON AT A OR OR BUSINESS THAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OFFER A- A SOLID QUOTE FOR. THE P. IS. ALTHOUGH WE ARE. IN A TOUGH. I SEE GOOD NIGHT KNOWING THAT MY- ARE. OF POP. FEATURED WITH THE PRODUCTS OF WILL TO AND- PLAY. KEEP GIVE HER. ARMALITE ALSO IN A- ARE. MOSTLY OF ELDER I COUNTY BUT WE ALL THIS IS KIND OF OUR- SO HARD TO PLACE HOMEOWNER INSURANCE ACROSS CALIFORNIA. COLORADO ALL OF THE HIGH FIRE AND SORT OF AREAS. THE ONE THING THAT I SAW DURING THIS IS THESE CHARTS SHOW AN AVERAGE ACROSS CALIFORNIA BUT WHAT THEY DON'T DO A SHOW YOU THE SNAPSHOT OF WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE RURAL COMMUNITIES. SO WE LOOK AT JUST MY BOOK OF BUSINESS WITH CALIFORNIA FAIR PLAN. IT IS NOW THE LARGEST OF PROPERTY INSURER WITHIN MY AGENCY THAT SHOULD NOT BE THE CASE. THE AVERAGE HOMEOWNER IN THESE REGIONS ARE PAYING ACTUALLY ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR THE HOMEOWNERS COSTS. PREVIOUS TO THAT AND THE- LIKE SACRAMENTO AREAS WERE LOOKING AT MORE LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. SO THE GAP IS EXTREME BETWEEN THOSE AREAS AND IN THE WILD LAND AREAS BUT IT'S NOT BEING ACCOUNTED FOR IT IS NOT BEING ASSESSED TO. THAT IMPACT. AS WELL AS IF WE LOOK TO EL DORADO COUNTY THEY ACTUALLY HAVE THE LEAST AMOUNT OF FIRE PROTECTION ACROSS THE OTHER COUNTY SO THEY'RE PAYING HIGHER PERCENTAGES. IT'S CAUSING THIS REAL ESTATE MARKET ACTUALLY DECLINE OR SEEN THE LOSS OF REVENUE ALREADY START TO AFFECT THESE REGIONS. AND AT ULTIMATELY IS GOING TO AFFECT THE FIRE STATIONS THERE AND IS GOING TO PERPETUATE THIS IF WE DON'T START TO SEE SOMETHING CHANGE. SO WHAT WE HAVE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING ON UP THERE IS FIRE WEIS COMMUNITIES TO HELP THESE MEDICATIONS I WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. ON WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO COME BACK AND- THE MEDICATION IS A VERY STRONG THING FOR THEM THE FIRE WEIS COMMUNITIES THE HOME HARDENING. BUT WE DON'T HAVE A GOOD CLEAR PATH FOR THESE COMMUNITIES ON HOW TO STRUCTURE THE FIRE WHY IS. WHAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE GOING TO ACCEPT AND TO STANDARDIZE THAT UNTIL WE HAVE THAT. UNTIL WE HAVE THAT STANDARDIZATION AND THE STANDARDIZATION AND WHAT WILD FIRE IS. WE'VE DEFINED IT FOR FEMA WE DEFINE IT FOR FLOOD IF WE HAD A CLEAR DEFINITION OF WILD FIRES IN THESE INSURANCE COMPANIES CAN ACTUALLY AS- WE NEED TO WRAP UP THE COMMENTS YOU HAVE A- FEW MORE SECONDS PLEASE THANK YOU. THAT THAT'S THE MAIN THING THEY'RE LOOKING AT IS THE INSURANCE COSTS AND ALSO THAT WHILE FIRE TO. BEING ABLE TO BE A- WHERE THEY CAN STAND UP IN COURT AND CLEARLY DEFINED NOT TO ALLOW SOME THAT RESTRUCTURING TO COME INTO PLACE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE NEED TO KEEP THE COMMENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE BRIEF THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS LAUREN HERNANDEZ AND FROM A DAUGHTER COUNTY DEMOCRATIC PARTY.

RISK MODELING AB OFFSET WITH MITIGATION STANDARDS FOR EACH TIER LEVEL OF RISK WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL HERE THERE ARE PROPOSALS THERE'S MODELS. THE FORTIFIED HOME PROGRAM THAT'S USED IN THE HIGH WIND GULF REGIONS EXPOSED TO HURRICANES. CAL FIRE WORKING WITH I. B. H.

THAT EXACTLY WHAT THEY RECOMMENDED IS WHAT NEEDS TO BE ADOPTED BUT- THERE'S ALREADY. BEEN DACIANS PROPOSALS OUT OF AN OUT THERE WE'RE NOT REINVENTING THE WHEEL BUT LIKE MANY OF SAID THESE COMMUNITIES. LIKE MINE. FACING NEIGHBORS AND SENIORS WHO ARE. NOT SURE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR HOME- IT'S REALLY CONCERNING AND A LOT OF FRUSTRATIONS IN OUR COMMUNITY PARTICULARLY FROM OUR POLITICAL PARTY IN. AND THE LACK OF INVESTMENT FOR A LOT OF THIS HAS IT'S ALL CONNECTED TO LOCK OF INTEREST. INVEST IN OUR- OUR ROLE. AND PAST FOR. OUR EXIT WAYS IN OUR WATER RESOURCES AND OUR TELECOMMUNICATIONS PEOPLE CAN EVACUATION THESE KIND SAFETY MEASURES THAT. LACK BASSMAN THESE COMMUNITIES.

INPUT FROM OUR AGENTS AND BROKERS THAT- THESE FACILITIES ARE UNDERGOING A MAJOR PROBLEMS WITH. TRYING TO GET INSURANCE WITH INSURANCE INCREASES- ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS WE TALK ABOUT IN YOUR- UPCOMING HEARING IS PERHAPS. HAVING THE FAIR PLAN RIGHT HIGHER COMMERCIAL INSURANCE- LIMITS I THINK RIGHT NOW THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE LIMITS ARE. THREE MILLION AND MAYBE GOING TO FIVE OR SEVEN OR TEN MILLION COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE. THERE ARE ON THE SUMMER CAMP AREA THERE'S OVER FOUR HUNDRED SUMMER CAMPS A RESIDENTIAL CAMPS ALL OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FROM. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THE TAHOE TO THE SANTA. CRUZ MOUNTAINS- OF MONO LAKE PAYER THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THEY'RE ALL RIGHT NOW MOSTLY WRITTEN IN THE NOT IN THE MARKET. ARE ALL SEEING THEIR- INSURANCE EITHER CANCEL AGO UP 300-500-1000 PERCENT. WE DO HAVE A THE PHONE COMPANY THAT HAS INNOVATIVE IDEAS OR TO BE TALKING TO THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT. THAT MAY PAVE THE WAY FOR OTHER COMPANIES TO. OTHER COMPANIES COME IN RIGHT THIS COVERAGE AS WELL THESE ARE ALL PRIMARILY ON BY. NONPROFIT GROUPS BOYS GIRLS CLUBS RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND I JUST CAN'T HANDLE THOSE KINDS INCREASES. FOR WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE DISCUSSION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. THAT HAVE MADAM. MY NAME IS AN BACK IN I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE- ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS I WAS NOT GOING TO GET UP TODAY. BUT I FELT COMPELLED TO SPEAK- BECAUSE OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS AS THIS ISSUE. HAS COME TO A HEAD- CERTAIN GROUPS HAVE BEEN INVOKING THE NAMEOF THE REALTORS AND I WOULD LIKE TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT WE ARE PERFECTLY CAPABLE OF SPEAKING. FOR OURSELVES ON THIS ISSUE AND WE ARE EXTREMELY CONCERNED. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO FINDING SOLUTIONS- WITH LEGISLATURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. HELLO MY NAME IS GLEN BROWN ON THE FIRE CHIEF THE GEORGETOWN CALIFORNIA FIRE DEPARTMENT IN ELDORADO COUNTY- I WAS REALLY HOPING SOMEBODY ELSE FROM THE FIRE SERVICE WOULD STAND UP- BECAUSE I'VE ONLY BEEN IN CALIFORNIA FOR FIVE MONTHS. I SPENT THE MAJORITY OF MY THIRTY SIX YEAR CAREER IN ARIZONA. BUT I WANTED TO BE HERE AS THE FIRE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE TO OFFER TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO TALK IS A CUSTOMER AS A CITIZEN- I RECENTLY PURCHASED ACREAGE IN IN- GEORGETOWN- I'VE BEEN A FORTY TWO YEAR CUSTOMER OF STATE FARM AND I'M NOT TELLING STATE FARM UNDER THE BUS BUT I. CALLED A LOCAL REPRESENTATIVE AND GAVE HIM MY ADDRESS AND HE SAID WE CAN INSURE YOU. AS WELL WHAT IF I. CLEARED COMPLETELY CLEARED MY ENTIRE PROPERTY AND BUILT A CONCRETE BUNKER IN THE MIDDLEOF IT DON'T MATTER. YOUR ADDRESS WE CAN'T INSURE. SO ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN ONE THING FOR TALKING ABOUTAND EL DORADO COUNTY JUST PAST AN OLD- VEGETATION MANAGEMENT ORDINANCE AND WE'RE- THE FIRE CHIEF SIR. ARE WORKING TOGETHER ON ON- ENFORCING THAT. BUT THE INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES ARE NOT BEING LOOKED AT AS INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES AND WHAT IS THE- PROTECTION WHAT WHAT KIND OF WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE WHAT KIND OF PROTECTION TO THE- THE- CONSUMERS PUT INTO THEIR OWN PROPERTIES. THEY'RE BEING RATED AS AN OVERALL WHATEVER THAT AREA IS AND IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT WE DO LOCALLY. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S IF THERE'S ANY WAY TO DO THAT BUT IF WE COULD LOOK AT INDIVIDUAL PROPERTIES. AND THEN AGAIN I JUST OFFER MYSELF UP AS A FIRE SERVICE REPRESENTATIVE IF ANYBODY HAS ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT FIRE SERVICE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS.
