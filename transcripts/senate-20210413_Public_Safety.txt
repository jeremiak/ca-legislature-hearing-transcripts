CONSIDER BRADFORD GLAD TO SEE YOU'RE WELL AND READY TO CHAIR OUR OUR MEETING AT AND YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR- SB TWO. THANK YOU MEMBERS AND- AUDIENCE AND CHEER I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB TO THE KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR PLEASE TO CERTIFICATION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE LET ME FIRST STATE CAN OF ROSS JUNIOR WAS A YOUNG AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE WHO LIVED IN THE CITY OF GARDENA. AND WAS GUNNED DOWN- IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN SHOT TWICE IN THE BACK BY A GUARDIAN A POLICE OFFICER. HE WAS ON ARMED- HE LIVED IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF REGULARS TO BUY REAL ONE IN THE COMMUNITY SO THIS IS- WHO THIS BILL IS IN MEMORY OF. THIS BILL IS BEING JORDAN AUTHORED BY OUR PRESIDENT PRO TEM TONI ATKINS OF MYSELF AND I THINK ALL THE CO AUTHORS WHO'VE COME ON BOARD AND IT ALSO HAPPENS TO BE A PRIORITY OF THE LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS. THIS BILL DOES TO SIMPLE THINGS FIRST BILL MAKES CHANGES TO STRENGTHEN THE TOM BAIN CIVIL RIGHTS ACT HE CLARIFIES THAT GENERAL INTENT TO INTERFERE WITH A PERSON'S CIVIL RIGHTS IS SUFFICIENT TO BRING A SUIT UNDER THE BAN AKKOR AT SPECIFIC CONTENT. IS THE CURRENT STANDARD TODAY A STANDARD THAT IS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET WITHOUT ADMISSION FROM THE OFFICER WHO COMMITTED THE MISCONDUCT. TO INSURE THAT A FAMILY MEMBER OF THE PERSON KILLED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT IS ALSO ABLE TO ASSERT A CALLS OF ACTION AND FINALLY CLARIFIES THAT THREE OF THE MOST EGREGIOUS IMMUNITIES CALMLY ASSERT ASSERTED. BY LAW ENFORCEMENT ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO THE CLAIMS BROUGHT UNDER THE BANNER ACT THESE INCLUDE PLANTING EVIDENCE OR FRAMING SOMEONE INJURING A PRISONER. FOR FAILING TO PROVIDE MEDICAL CARE. TO PRISONERS IN THEIR CUSTODY. THESE ARE. THAT ARE VOTE OF AND- TO AND POLICING. ABILITY AND RESTORE COMMUNITY TRUST AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. SECONDLY THIS BILL CREATES A STATEWIDE PROCESS TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF AN OFFICER AFTER THE CONVICTION OF A SERIOUS CRIME. OR TERMINATION FROM EMPLOYMENT DUE TO MISCONDUCT. WE'RE NOW ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION THAT DOES NOT HAVE A SYSTEM FOR DECERTIFYING BAD OFFICERS AND I'M GONNA RESTATE THIS IS FOR BAD OFFICERS NOT THE MAJORITY OF MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT THE UNIFORM ON AND BACK INTO THEIR JOB CORRECTLY EACH AND EVERY DAY. WE WANT TO THANK THEM A RECOGNIZABLE THIS IS FOR THE BAT OFF ACTORS THAT WE KNOW EXIST AND ALL WALKS OF LIFE. CALIFORNIA IS ABLE TO REVOKE THE CITRIX CERTIFICATION OR LICENSE OF A BACK TO BACK DOCTORS. ABOUT LAWYERS. BRAD BARBERS AND COSMETOLOGISTS AND WE CAN EVEN REMOVE BAD POLITICIANS BUT WERE UNABLE TO DE CERTIFY POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW AND VIOLATED PUBLIC TRUST. FOR EXAMPLES BARBERS CAN LOSE THEIR LICENCE ARE HOW ONE REVOKED FOR INCOMPETENCE GROSS NEGLIGENCE NEGLIGENCE OR DRUNKENNESS OR EVEN FALSE AND DECEPTIVE ADVERTISEMENT. FOR OFFICERS WHO DON'T REQUIRE ANY FOLLOW UP AFTER THEIR INITIAL. BUT IF BUT ALFS IS DAMAGED REQUIRE ANY INITIALLY. RECEIVE THEIR CERTIFICATION AND FOLLOW UP I SHOULD SAY AFTER INITIAL CERTIFICATION WE DON'T EVEN HAVE A PROCESS FOR REQUIRING DEPARTMENTS TO COMPLETE AN INVESTIGATION AFTER OFFICER HAS REASON RESIGNED OR BEEN FIRED DUE TO MISCONDUCT. IN FACT OUR CURRENT SYSTEM INCENTIVIZES OFFICERS TO LEAVE AN APARTMENT BEFORE THEY ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. FOR THEIR ACTIONS AND TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT COMMUNITY WE CALL THIS THE WASH RINSE REPEAT CYCLE THAT HAS GONE ON FOR FAR TOO LONG- AND AGAIN THE MOTHER CHAPEL WAS AGAIN THE OFFICER WHO SHOT. KENNETH ROSS JUNIOR HE HAD. BEEN INVOLVED IN THREE QUESTIONABLE SHOOTINGS IN ORANGE COUNTY. AND HE LEFT THAT DEPARTMENT BEFORE BEING FIRED ONLY TO BE HIRED BY THE CITY OF GARDENA. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE IN CALIFORNIA STATE THEIR PRIDES ITSELF IN BEING A LEADER ON CRIMINAL JUSTICE. AND PUBLIC SAFETY. LAW ENFORCEMENT AND COMMUNITY HAVING ADVOCATES RECOGNIZE AND AGREE. THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM HOWEVER WE ALSO MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE CURRENT SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS INSUFFICIENT. UNITY'S KNOW WHO THE BAD OFFICERS ARE BETTER IN THEIR- IN THEIR LOCAL DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE SIGNED TO BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES OR COMMUNITIES OF LOW INCOME. IT IS SO RARE THAT THESE OFFICERS ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN COURT OR HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THEIR OWN DEPARTMENT. IF THEY'RE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THIS WILL BE. BILL WILL ENSURE THAT THESE BAD OFFICERS WILL NOT TAKE THIS MISCONDUCT TO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY. FAR TOO OFTEN THESE GUYS GO TO THE SMALLER- DEPARTMENT WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ALLEN ACADEMY AND- TRAIN THEIR OWN OFFICERS SO THERE I WILL GLADLY TAKE OFFICERS WHO HAVE COME FROM A BIGGER DEPARTMENT DESPITE THEIR BACKGROUND IN HISTORY. THIS IS DOROTHY IS IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CREATING AN EFFECTIVE THE CERTIFICATION SYSTEM. WE WILL ALSO BE CREATING AN ADVISORY BOARD WITHIN POLLS THAT WOULD MAKE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON WHETHER POST SHOULD DECERTIFY AN OFFICER AND FINALLY THIS BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO DEFINE BY REGULATION THE SPECIFIC GROUNDS OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT CONDUCT THAT WOULD. BE CONSIDERED FOR DECERTIFICATION SYRUP SYRUP SEVERAL OF THESE EGREGIOUS GROUNDS ARE LAID OUT IN THE BILL SUCH AS SEXUAL SAW. DISHONESTY AND ABUSE OF POWER AMONG OTHERS ULTIMATELY THE COMMISSION HAS AUTHORITY TO DEFINE WHAT EXACTLY IS MISCONDUCT THAT CAN BE THAT CAN LEAD TO DECERTIFICATION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THIS BILL IS STILL WORK IN PROGRESS AND WE REMAIN COMMITTED. TO ENGAGE WITH THE STAKE HOLDERS BOTH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE BUT CHANGE MUST COME TO POLICING IN CALIFORNIA AGAIN WE'RE ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES IN THE NATION IT'S NOT HAVE A DECERTIFICATION PROCESS. MEANINGFUL REFORM NOT JUST SUPERFICIAL CHANGES TO KEEP THE STATUS QUO IN PLACE THAT ALLOWS POLICE. TO BE ACCOUNTABLE ONLY TO THEMSELVES. THIS IS WHAT CALIFORNIA ACROSS OUR STATE CALIFORNIANS ACROSS THE STATE ARE DEMANDING AS WELL AS THE NATION. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT THEY CAN TRUST WILL TREAT THEM FAIRLY. AND WILL BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THE ABUSE THAT TRUST. THIS BILL IS A PRIORITY ONCE AGAIN LEGISLATIVE BLACK CAUCUS IS SPONSORED BY COMEDIAN GRASSROOTS ORGANIZATIONS AND SUPPORTED BY THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. WHO ARE LOOKING TO US TO PASS MEANINGFUL REFORMS IN THIS AREA. TESTIFYING TODAY IN SUPPORT OF. OUR TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE LIVES FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DEVASTATED BY BAD OFFICERS WHO TOOK THE LIVES OF THEIR LOVED ONES. BUT HE'S A ALAMO GROUP. OUR MOTHER OF CAN THE FRONT JUNIOR. PAN MACHIKO MONTERROSA SISTER SCHON MONTERROSA WILL BE TESTIFYING TODAY AND I APPRECIATE THEM BOTH FOR TEARING ABOUT SHARING THEIR STORIES AND TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL TODAY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. I BELIEVE- MISS MON TO ROSE IS HERE PRESENT TODAY AM I CORRECT YES WE'LL START WITH- AND- I. WELCOME YOUR TESTIMONY. HELLO EVERYONE I'M HERE TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SB TWO WHICH WOULD CREATE A MECHANISM FOR DECERTIFICATION THIS CERTIFYING OFFICERS WHO ARE UNFIT TO WEAR A BADGE. I AM MICHELLE MONTERROSA ALONG LIFELONG RESIDENT OF SAN FRANCISCO AND THE SURVIVING SISTER OF MY BROTHER SHOT MONTH THAT ALSO. WHAT OUR FAMILY HAS BEEN PUT THROUGH BY THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT WOULD TAKE MORE THAN THE TIME I HAVE HERE TODAY I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT. THE WAYS IT ILLUSTRATES THE NEED FOR SB TWO. ON JUNE SECOND TWENTY TWENTY SEAN WAS UNARMED KNEELING WITH HIS HANDS UP WHEN OFFICER JERK TIME. THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT SHOT THROUGH THE WINDSHIELD UNMARKED PICKUP TRUCK BUT THAT THEY ARE FIFTEEN. JOHN WAS KILLED INSTANTLY. THESE ARE THE ONLY LICENSED PROFESSIONALS ARE CURRENTLY NOT CANNOT BE DECERTIFIED FOR UNETHICAL AND HARMFUL ACTIONS. VIRTUALLY EVERYONE ELSE FROM BART BARBERS TO LAWYERS WILL LOSE THEIR LICENSE IF THEY VIOLATE. VIOLATE THE TRUST PLACED IN THEM BY THE STATE. THIS IS ALSO A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME AS IT IS FOR MANY FAMILIES HAVE LOST A LOVED ONE TO POLICE VIOLENCE. THE OFFICER WHO SHOT JOHN DETECTIVE JERRY TIME. HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN FOUR OTHER OFFICER INVOLVED SHOOTINGS IN THE PAST FIVE YEARS. BEFORE TRANSFERRING TO THE VALLEJOPOLICE DEPARTMENT. OFFICER TIME WORK FOR. PD MORE HE WAS INVOLVED IN AT LEAST ONE SHOOTING THAT WE KNOW UP. IMMEDIATELY AFTER SHAUN WAS SHOT OFFICER TIME CAN BE HEARD IN THE FOOTAGE SAYING I DIDN'T NEED THIS TODAY. TO WHICH A SENIOR COMMANDING OFFICER RESPONDED BY SAYING IT'S OKAY WE'VE BEEN THROUGH THIS BEFORE. CHANGED SINCE JOHN'S DEATH THE PRESIDENT OF THE- VALLEJO POLICE UNION. ORDERED THE DESTRUCTION OF EVIDENCE IN OUR BROTHER'S CASE BEFORE AN INVESTIGATION COULD BE CONDUCTED. IT'S COME TO LIGHT THAT THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT'S ACTIONS. FOR THE MOST DEADLIEST IN THE COUNTRY. WE'VE ALSO LEARNED THAT THE POLICE UMBILICAL BENDER BADGES TO MARK HOW MANY BODIES THEY'VE KILLED. THIS IS IN NO WAY AN ISOLATED CASE THERE ARE MANY OTHER FAMILIES NOT JUST IN VALLEJO BUT IT ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WHO HAVE SIMILAR STORIES ABOUT THE WAYS THAT THE POLICE HAVE SWEPT THE DEATHS OF THEIR LOVED ONES UNDER THE RENTS. POLICE SIMPLY POLICE CANNOT POLICE THEMSELVES. SB TWO WILL ALLOW POST TO CONDUCT INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES DISTORT OR SUPPRESS EVIDENCE IS. LIKE THE VALLEJO POLICE DEPARTMENT DID IN MY BROTHER'S CASE. THERE IS MORE OF OUR URGENCY FOR US TO PASS S. B. TWO AND WE HOPE THAT THIS IS THE YEAR WE CAN SEE REAL ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OUR NEXT WITNESS. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN. OKAY GREAT.

HAVING HEARD FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS WE WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION. WE CURRENTLY HAVE TO LEAVE OPPOSITION. I THINK WE- AND JONATHON FELDMAN. IS CALLING FOR WILLIAM ON THE LINE. I AM. PLEASE GO AHEAD. BEFORE I BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO CONVEY MY SINCERE GRATITUDE IN BEING INVITED TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING MY NAME IS ALAN COULD BE ALMA AND I SERVED AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE ALAMEDA POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION- ORGANIZATION WITHIN THE GREATER STATEWIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT ORGANIZATION. KNOWN AS KORAC OR THE PEACE OFFICERS RESEARCH ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. CHIPS IT'S INCEPTION LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN IN A CONSTANT STATE OF PERFORMANCE AND PRACTICE BEEN A LONGSTANDING LEADER THROUGH THIS PROCESS ADVOCATING FOR VICTIMS RIGHT. HIGHER TRAINING AND RECRUITMENT STANDARDS ELIMINATION OF QUOTAS AND MORE COMMUNITY BASED POLICING TO NAME A FEW H. CALIFORNIA CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE ABOUT IMPROVING THE PRACTICE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT IT IS IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT WE ALL SHARE THE SAME GOAL. TO KEEP OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES STATE. I AM PLEASED THAT YOU'VE INVITED ME TODAY'S TALK ABOUT SENATE BILL TWO. DEVELOPING LEGISLATION TO ESTABLISH A LICENSURE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA IS A PRIORITY FOR PORAC. NO ONE WANTS TO SEE ABOUT OFFICERS REMOVED FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT MORE THAN GOOD OFFICERS DO. WHEN AN OFFICER ACTS IN A WAY THAT IS GROSSLY INCONSISTENT WITH THE MISSIONS AND GOALS OF OUR PROFESSION IT GIVES ALL LAW ENFORCEMENT A BAD NAME. AND ONLY HARMS OUR ABILITY TO BUILD BACK THE COMMUNITY TRUST WE NEED TO CARRY OUT OUR SERVICE SHAPELY AND EFFECTIVELY. HOWEVER SB TWO IS NOT THE RIGHT APPROACH. SB TO CREATE A POTENTIALLY BIASED PANEL TO OVERSEE THE PROCESS OF REVOKING AN OFFICER'S LICENSE TO PRACTICE LAW ENFORCEMENT IGNORING OUR COUNTRY'S TRADITION OF DUE PROCESS AND SUBJECTING OFFICERS TO A BIASED REVIEW OF THEIR ACTIONS WERE GUILT IS ASSUMED AND THE DECK IS STACKED AGAINST THEM. SHE WILL SB TWO IS BEING PRESENTED AS THE POLICE REFORM MEASURE THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW LICENSING PROCESS. THE TRUTH IS THAT S. B. T. REACHES FAR BEYOND THE POLICE LICENSING PROCESS INCLUDES POLICIES THAT WOULD BE DETRIMENTAL TO ALL CALIFORNIA CITIES. COUNTIES AND PUBLIC EMPLOYEES. MY TESTIMONY TODAY WILL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON THE FLOOR LICENSING PROTOCOL BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS WHERE WE WILL FIND THE GREATEST OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER TOWARDS FINDING A COMPROMISE THAT WILL BENEFIT ALL CALIFORNIANS INCLUDING BOTH OFFICERS AND THE COMMUNITIES WE SERVE. I ALSO WANT TO SHINE A LIGHT ON THE FACT THAT AS WRITTEN SB TWO WOULD OPEN THE FLOODGATES OF LITIGATION AGAINST ALL PUBLIC OFFICIALS NOT JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT. BURDENING CALIFORNIA CITIES AND COUNTIES WITH UNSUSTAINABLE LEGAL COSTS FORCING BUDGET CUTS FOR BIO. PROGRAMS AND SERVICES. WE CANNOT ALLOW OFFICERS TO DAMAGE. GROSSMITH TAKEN TO BE MA'AM OF THE COURSE PROFESSION. THEIR LIVES IN MY BE REVOKED. HOWEVER WRITTEN SB TWO WOULD OVER RIDE DUE PROCESS. ESTABLISHING A NINE PERSON PANEL TO OVERSEE THE LICENSE REVOCATION PROCESS THAT INCLUDES SEVEN MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WITH NO REQUIREMENTS FOR EXPERTISE OR PRIOR EXPERIENCE IN THE PRACTICE OF PUBLIC SAFETY OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. WITH TO THE SEVEN HAVING BEEN SUBJECT TO THE LONG FOR USE OF FORCE OR RELATED TO SOMEONE SUBJECT TO THE WRONGFUL USE OF COURSE. AND ONLY TWO MEMBERS WITH EXPERTISE OR PRIOR STREETS. EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY AND IT'S AN UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY AND EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO DUE PROCESS. INCLUDING THOSE CHARGED WITH MAKING SPLIT SECOND LIFE OR DEATH DECISION TO HELP KEEP OUR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES STATE. UNDER AMERICAN RULE OF LAW ONCE A COURT OR TRIBUNAL HAS FOUND ANNOUNCER INNOCENT OF THE ALLEGED MISCONDUCT SHE OR SHE SHOULD NOT BE SUBJECTED TO DOUBLE JEOPARDY MEANING THE CONCURRENT OR CONSECUTIVE RELATED CATION OF IDENTICAL FACTUAL. AND LEGAL DISPUTE. SB TO IGNORE THIS BASIC TENET OF FAIRNESS BY ALLOWING COULD BE LITIGATING OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT ALLEGATIONS. AND WILL RESULT IN INCONSISTENT AND INCOMPATIBLE LEGAL AND FACTUAL DETERMINATIONS. THE PURPOSE OF DOUBLE JEOPARDY IS TO PROTECT CITIZENS FROM BEING PROSECUTED FOR THE SAME OFFENSE SAME OFFENSE AFTER BEING ACQUITTED. THAT IS BECAUSE WE AND- HAVE DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD NOT SERVE THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE TO PLACE SOMEONE TWICE FOR LIBERTY IN JEOPARDY TWICE FOR THE SAME OFFENSE. THE SAME PRINCIPLE MUST APPLY TO THE PROCESS THE POLICE LICENSURE. IF AN OFFICER'S EXONERATED THROUGH OUR PROCESS OVERSEEN BY AN INDEPENDENT BODY IT WOULD NOT BE RIGHT TO PLACE OUR OFFICERS CAREER REPUTATION AND LIVELIHOOD IN JEOPARDY TWICE BY GRANTING THIS PANEL THE AUTHORITY TO OVERTURN THAT DECISION. THAT IS WHY PRICE SUPPORTS GRANTING THE PEACE OFFICER STANDARDS AND TRAINING% COMMISSION AS AN INDEPENDENT CIRCLING GOVERNMENT AGENCY. FORTY TO OVERSEE THE POLICE LICENSURE PROGRAM WHICH IN PART WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVOKE AN OFFICER'S LICENSE FOR SPECIFIC INSTANCES APPROVING OFFICER MISCONDUCT SUCH AS SUSTAINED MISCONDUCT TO THE USE OF EXCESSIVE FORCE. SHALL ANY CONVICTIONS OR CONVICTIONS OF SPECIFIED MISDEMEANORS. SEXUAL CALLED. JOB RELATED TO. MR CUYAMA GONNA PREVIOUS IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND JUST WRAPPING IT UP REALLY QUICK WE ARE WE'VE GIVEN YOU A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE TWO MINUTES ALLOTTED. SURE WITHOUT I JUST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE TIME- THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO WORK TOGETHER AND I HOPE WE CAN ALL JOIN TOGETHER AT THE TABLE TO COME UP WITH A SPARE PROGRAM THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PROTECT. ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR OBAMA- OUR NEXT WITNESS IS JONATHON FELDMAN IS MR FELDMAN ON THE LINE. YES VENTURE PLEASE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU AND I'LL BE BRIEF- NOT TO REITERATE THE COMMENTS ON THE CALL WITH CORK- BUT I ALSO LIKE THANK THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THIS ISSUE AND COME UP WITH THIS POLICY FORWARD WE ARE ALSO LOOKING FORWARD TO FIND A COMMON GROUND. ON AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE- THE CHAPLAIN TOLD. THE POLICE YOU US. SUPPORTS TWO. HOLY I'D LIKE TO START BY TALKING ABOUT THE AREAS THAT WE FIND AGREEMENT ON. WITHIN THE BILL. WE AGREE THAT ANY OFFICER FOUND GUILTY OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT SHOULD NO LONGER BE AN OFFICER WHICH INCLUDES EXCESSIVE FORCE FAILURE TO INTERCEDE SEXUAL ASSAULT INTENTIONAL DISHONESTY WRONGFUL ARREST ABUSE OF POWER BIASED POLICING. OR ACTIVE PARTICIPATION IN ORGANIZED CRIMINAL CONDUCT I'M NOT THAT. NO OFFICERS BEEN FOUND RIGHT YES THAT SECRETARY CALL THE BE POLICE IN OUR- AND THAT'S A- HARD. DEFINITIVE BOB THAT CENTER. AGENCY SHOULD ALSO WE AGREE COMPLETE INVESTIGATE TO MISS REGARDLESS OF AN OFFICER RESIGNS IS TERM- PARTIALLY THROUGH THOSE INVESTOR WHICH SUPPORTED CALL LAST. THAT MAKES ABSOLUTE SENSE ENSURE THAT NO SHOULD POINT TO THE CRY. BUT WE AGREE THAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERRED. WITH PLACE REVIEW AND HOW AUDIT INTO INVEST. AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE ALL CERTAINLY LED BOARD WITHIN POST. PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL. AND- CHOOSE ALSO BELIEVE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT REVIEW THE BACKGROUND OF EACH OFFICER HIRING COME DONE SH WHEN WE DO. ON THE BILL. IS- USED CREATED UNDER THE BAN ACT WHICH GOES BEYOND EVEN GENERAL INTENT IN A LOWER THAN THAT FROM SPECIFIC CONTENT. TO THE STANDARD. BUT DELIVERED A TO RECORD AND THAT WE BELIEVE THAT A THERE'S A LOT OF KIND WITH THAT STANDARD WE HAD A I THINK OF CALL WITH SOME OF THE SPONSORS BILL EARLY THIS WEEK- AND I LOOKED TO CONTINUE THIS CALL IN LOOKING IN- WHAT ABOUT CHANGES IN THE- THAT WOULD MAKE SENSE. WHEN WE THE OTHER BIG ISSUES THAT WE DISAGREE THE SCOPE AND- POWERS BILLING OR TO CO. OP AS YOU CAN SERIOUSNESS AGAINST FIRED REGULARLY.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MODERATOR- THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS DO ANY OF OUR MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AFTER ABOUT LONGER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR. REINTRODUCING THIS BILL- THE ONE QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH THE ARM. IT SAYS IN THE BILL THAT IT WILL GRANT BECAUSE THE POWER TO INVESTIGATE- AND SO I WAS WONDERING IS THERE A LENGTH OF TIME. IN THE BILL WITH REGARDS TO HOW LONG AN INVESTIGATION CAN BE GOING ON REGARDING A POTENTIAL DECERTIFICATION. AND I ASK BECAUSE OFTEN TIMES- THESE EXTENDED PERIODS OF TIME FOR INVESTIGATION ARE ALSO USED TO EITHER STALL OR TO DELAY- DECISIONS OR- ACTIONS. THE SPEAK TO SPECIFIC TIME BUT IT IS OUR HOPES THAT THIS WILL BE A EXPEDITED PROCESS THAT MAKES IT FAIR TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE BEING INVESTIGATED NO ONE WANTS TO PROLONG THIS SAME TIME- WE WANT. JUSTICE TO BE BROUGHT FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO HAVE CONCERNS AS TO THE CONDUCT THAT IS UNDER REVIEW SO- IT DIDN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO TALK BUT- BERMAN HE IS IN AN- EXPEDITING THIS PROCESS IS. THIS TO ALL OF OUR BEST ADVANTAGE. THE- OPPOSITION TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS BEING DETRIMENTAL TO CITIES AND COUNTIES AND- THE COST OPENING THE FLOODGATES FOR- LAWSUITS- BUT ALSO I THINK WHAT'S MAYBE NOT WHAT WASN'T MENTIONED IS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY TONS OF COSTS THAT ARE LEVIED ON CITIES AND COUNTIES I WITH REGARDS TO THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS AGAINST- ROGUE LAW ENFORCEMENT'S WHICH RESULT IN TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND LAWSUITS. AND SO I DON'T KNOW I'M SURE YOU CAN SPEAK TO IT BUT MAYBE THE OPPOSITION CAN CAN SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT THAT ALSO CURRENTLY GOES ON AND WOULDN'T WE WANT- POLICY THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW. FOR CITIES AND COUNTIES TO NOT HAVE TO PAY OUT- THOSE- FEET THOSE COSTS THOSE SETTLEMENT COSTS- USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS- BY COMING UP WITH A POLICY THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO. EXPEDITIOUSLY LOOK INTO THIS KIND OF MISCONDUCT AND PROVES THAT PREVENTS CITIES AND COUNTIES FROM HAVING TO DEAL WITH THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS. IF ON THE I. VISION TO BUT I WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO MENTION TO TALK ABOUT THIS. YEAH- SENATOR COMMODITY JONATHON FELDMAN WITH THE POLICE CHIEF THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I THINK AGAIN THERE IS A LOT OF AGREEMENT- THAT REMOVING BAD OFFICERS HAS THAT BENEFITS NOT JUST FOR THE COMMUNITIES AND THOSE THAT THEY COULD POTENTIALLY BE USED BUT ALSO FOR THE CITIES ARE NO LONGER LIABLE FOR THE BAD OFFICERS. THAT'S WHY WE AGREE WITH GETTING RID OF THEM. WHAT WE HAVE CONCERNS WITH IS CHANGES TO THE CIVIL LIABILITY STATUTES THAT LOWER THE STANDARDS TO A POINT THAT. WE BELIEVE IT IS DETRIMENTAL. A STANDARD THAT'S BLOWN UP SAID IN AN OFFICER ACTION SPLIT SECOND COULD STILL POTENTIALLY BE CIVILLY LIABLE FOR THAT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT IT WILL COMPLETELY CLOSED OFF TO THE IDEAS OF CHANGING YOU KNOW THE SPECIFIC INTENT STANDARD WITHIN THE BANNACK- BUT THE STANDARD PUT IN PLACE CURRENTLY. WE HAVE CONCERNS THAT AS WITH THE CITIES WHICH NOTED BY THE WITNESS TO TESTIFY AT FIRST- INCLUDES OTHER PUBLIC- EMPLOYEES. OPERATING A THEIR COULD THE PROFESSIONAL. HUH WELL YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT DUE PROCESS WOULD BE COMPROMISED AS A RESULT OF THIS AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT DECERTIFICATION STILL OFFERS FULL AND FAIR DUE PROCESS PRIOR TO ANY ADVERSE ACTION. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT. THAT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE LOOKS LIKE TWO TRACKS UNDER THE BILL WE HAVE THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND THE LOCAL PROCESS AS BARGAINED WITH THEIR PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS. PRODUCE CROSSES INTO THE REVIEW OF THEIR CONDUCT AND EDUCATION THURMOND WHICH COULD INCLUDE IN A COURT OF APPEALS- AND THEN WE HAVE A SEPARATE PROCESS LAID ON TOP OF THAT WE OPPOSE COULD LOOK INTO IT EVEN IF THEY'VE ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE FIRST LOCAL PROCESS AND BEEN FOUND YOU KNOW EITHER AND SUSTAINED EXONERATED. BY THE COMPLETED BEEN FOUNDED BY THEY COULD BE RETRIED BY POST UNTIL DECEMBER ALJ THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RUBIO- AND THEN FOUND GUILTY AND THAT'S WHERE WE TALK AND WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE DOUBLE JEOPARDY OR CONCERNED WITH- YOU KNOW BEING TRIED TWICE THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN COMES. FROM THE FACT THAT THERE ARE TWO SEPARATE. SIMILAR TO THIS PROCESSES COULD BE. WOULD RATHER SEE ONE STREAM PROCESS THAT I DON'T. THE OFFICE WHO ARE GUILTY OF MISCONDUCT THE NUMBER THAT. I THINK IT ALLOWS FOR- INVESTIGATION AND FULL TRANSPARENCY. WHICH I THINK IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT- YOU ALSO LAST QUESTION MADAM CHAIR IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME IS THAT I ROMS. I RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT EVERYONE WHO SPOKE IN OPPOSITION THE KEY WITNESSES SAID THAT IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET RID OF THOSE- YOU KNOW ROGUE POLICE OFFICERS- THIS IS A QUESTION MY UNDERSTANDING AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS THAT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF VERY GOOD POLICE OFFICERS THAT ARE WORKING. FROM IN THE FIELD BUT THE ONES WHO ARE. ROGAN COMMITTING THESE- WHERE THEY'RE INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS OF GROSS MISCONDUCT. THEY'RE ABLE TO ONCE THEY'RE TERMINATED OR DISCIPLINED THEY ARE STILL ABLE TO WEASEL INTO ANOTHER DEPARTMENT- AND SO WHICH IS IN ITS INFANT COMBIN UPON US TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO FERRET THOSE BAD ACTORS OUT- BECAUSE THOSE BAD ACTORS ARE NOT ONLY HARMING THE PUBLIC BUT THEY'RE ALSO DOING HARM TO THEIR PARTICULAR DEPARTMENT- TO MAYBE TO THEIR COLLEAGUES AND THEIR PARTNERS INTO THE FOREST ARE WE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT. YES WE ARE IN AGREEMENT ON THAT AND THAT'S YOU KNOW IN MY IN MY OPENING STATEMENT I MENTIONED THAT YOU KNOW. WE FULLY SUPPORT POLICY THAT REQUIRES AGENCIES TO COMPLETE THESE INVESTIGATIONS REGARDLESS OF THE OFFICER RESIGNS OR IS FIRED PART OF THE- THE- FINAL OUTCOME. SO THAT WE'RE NOT LETTING INDIVIDUALS FALL TO THE CRACKS AND ANY- REHIRED ELSEWHERE. SO YOU KNOW AGAIN IN AGREEMENT- YOU KNOW I THINK. ONE OF THE ISSUES THOUGH. AND WE TALK ABOUT ABOUT HOW LATERAL TRANSFERS- OFFICERS BEING HIRED ELSEWHERE- I THINK TO ALSO HELP PREVENT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT- INCLUDING OUR OUTREACH AND RECRUITMENT OF THE NEXT GENERATION OF PEACE OFFICERS ENSURING THAT WE GET A MORE DIVERSE MORE- REPRESENTATIVES GROUP. COMING INTO THE PROFESSION SO THAT WE'RE NOT HAVING TO RECYCLE SOME OF THOSE OFFICERS ARE PROBLEMS- YOU KNOW RECRUITMENT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE. FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION AND IT'S ONLY GETTING WORSE SO YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB- BRINGING IN QUALIFIED CANDIDATES INTO THE PROFESSION AND ATTACHING THEM TO. THE LEADERS IN THE SPACE. THAT'S KIND OF WHERE WE WOULD SEE MORE TRANSFORMATIVE CHANGE LONG TERM- AND WE HAVE POLICIES THAT WE'RE WORKING ON TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE- THAT THAT YOU GET TO SEE SAM- IN THE IN A MATTER OF WEEKS- AND THE PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AS WELL. THANK YOU I WANT TO SAY THAT IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF GETTING THESE FROM. BAD ACTORS OFF THE STREETS BECAUSE YOU CAN DO THAT AND THEN THEY CAN STILL BE. TRANSITIONED INTO DETECTIVE STATUS OR SOME OTHER STATUS THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN WORKING AT A DESK OR NOT REALLY WORKING WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC. BUT I TELL YOU THAT GREAT HARM CAN STILL BE DONE. BECAUSE THERE ARE STILL OPPORTUNITIES TO INTIMIDATE TO HARASS- TO IMPACT THE CULTURE IN THAT DEPARTMENT. TO FALSIFY RECORDS TO INTIMIDATE WITNESSES AND SO IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE BEGIN TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT. FROM THE STEM TO THE STERN SO THAT WE CAN CREATE DEPARTMENTS THAT. REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO PROTECT AND ALSO ARE ABLE TO REBUILD THE TRUST WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES. THAT THEY ARE ENTRUSTED TO PROTECT- AND SO THIS I THINK IS WHAT THIS BILL IS STRIVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WECAN CREATE. THAT KIND OF ACCOUNTABILITY- ON THE ONE END SINCE WE CONTINUE TO ASK FOR THOSE. WHO ARE LIVING IN THESE NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES TO STEP UP WITH REGARDS TO- YOU KNOW. THEIR OBLIGATION. TO BE A PARTNER. I'M IN THIS THING WE CALL PUBLIC SAFETY SO. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWERS AND MADAM CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME WITH THOSE QUESTIONS AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU SENATOR I BELIEVE I MISSPOKE WHEN I'M OFF THE STREETS AND JOHN SORRY TO INTERRUPT- I MEANT TERMINATED FIRE DECERTIFIED NOT MOVED INTO ANOTHER POSITION. ALL RIGHT IF THE CLERK THAT REAL QUICK I WAS JUST A COLLOQUIALISM. YEAH I MEANT COMPLETELY REMOVED FROM. THE PROFESSION THANK YOU THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM. SENATE WIENER I THANK YOU I'M NOT SURE OF- WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I'M PROUD TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF THIS BILL I JUST THINK IT MAKES A LOT OF SENSE- AND I'M SOMEONE WHO I'VE HAD. EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS THE DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY- AND- YOU KNOW AND THE KINDS OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS THAT ARISE AROUND PLACE AND I'VE SEEN THE GOOD I'VE SEEN THE BAD AND I'VE SEEN THE UGLY AND- YOU KNOW I THINK- YOU KNOW THE IDEA. POLICING IS A PROFESSION- AND IF SOMEONE IS NOT GOOD ASSEMBLY IMPRESSION ANYMORE AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO JUST PUT FROM ONE DEPARTMENT TO ANOTHER- AND YOU KNOW RESIGN RESIGN IN THE MIDDLE OF AN INVESTIGATION OR WHATEVER- AND THEN AND THEN BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ITS IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT A GOOD GOVERNMENT AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR FOR THE COMMUNITY- AND SO- AS CO AUTHOR AND- HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION I CAN'T REMEMBER IF THERE WAS A MOTION BUT IF NOT I MOVE THE BILL. THERE ISN'T YET. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE OKAY SEE NO FURTHER COMMITTEE COMMENTS I HAVE A FEW THINGS I LIKE TO ADD- FIRST WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HIS TIRELESS EFFORT ON THIS ISSUE. IT'S BEEN MADE CLEAR TO ME THAT YOU'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY ON THIS ON THIS ENDEAVOR I'M OF INFIRM AGREEMENT THAT IT IS WHOLLY UNACCEPTABLE THAT WE ARE ONE OF ONLY FOUR STATES RIGHT FOR STATES THAT DOESN'T HAVE A PROCESS IN PLACE TO HOLD THAT OFFICERS ACCOUNTABLE. I AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR IN THE STATEMENTS HE HAS MADE ON THE SPELL OF ONE THAT IS CALIFORNIA'S ABLE TO REVOKE THE CERTIFICATION OF LICENSE. OR LICENSES OF BAD OUT DOCTORS LAWYERS TEACHERS AND EVEN BARBERS BUT IS UNABLE TO DISH THIS CERTIFIED POLICE OFFICERS WHO HAVE BROKEN THE LAW. AND VIOLATED THE PUBLIC TRUST THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE ENTRUST LAW ENFORCEMENT WITH GREAT POWER AND AS SUCH IT IS REASONABLE THAT THEY BE HELD TO A HIGH STANDARD OF ACCOUNTABILITY. HOWEVER I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THIS BILL- THIS BILL APPEARS TO MAKE THIS CERTIFICATION MANDATORY FOR BOTH. STATUTORY LIST OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND A SECONDARY LIST OF SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. AS DEFINED BY POST IN REGULATIONS. THERE IS NO ANY INTERMEDIATE ALTERNATIVE SANCTION FOR ANY ACTION- SECTION FOURTEEN OF YOUR BILL READS AS FOLLOWS. A CERTIFIED P. PEACE OFFICER SHALL HAVE THEIR CERTIFICATION REVOKED AND IT UP WE CAN SHOW HAVE THEIR OBLIGATION FOR CERT DENIED. UPON A DETERMINATION THAT THEY HAVE VIOLATED A SET OF LIST OF OFFENSES IN THIS BILL. SOME OF WHICH ARE WORDED IN A PRETTY BROAD NATURE. OR IF THEY HAVE BY LADY YET TO BE DETERMINED REGULATIONS FROM POST. FOR THE SHORT TIME I'VE BEEN HRE ON THIS COMMITTEE I'VE SEEN THAT THERE IS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WE ARE MAKING A MOVE AWAY FROM A BLACK AND WHITE SENTENCING. AND ACKNOWLEDGING THAT SOMETIMES THERE IS A GREAT AREA. THE WAY THIS BILL IS WRITTEN SEEMS TO REQUIRE A LIFETIME TO CERTIFICATION OF AN OFFICER WITHOUT ANY REGARD TO CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING AN INCIDENT. EVEN IF A LESSER PUNISHMENT MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE HAVE YOU CONSIDERED A MORE NUANCED APPROACH TO- HERE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE COMMISSION TO CONSIDER THESE PUNISHMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THE SPECIFIC FACTS OF EACH CASE. THAT'S WHAT THE BACKGROUND INVESTIGATED THE INVESTIGATION IT'S ALL ABOUT I MEAN THERE'S SIX LAYERS TO THE INVESTIGATION SO TO SAY THAT THERE'S A BLANKET. DISMISSAL ONCE YOU'RE DETERMINED TO BE CERTIFIED AS A FOR THE FARTHEST THING FROM THE TRUTH. THE OFFICER EVEN HAS- TO. THE FINAL HEARING. FROM ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE EVEN IF IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY SHOULD BE TO CERTIFY THEY CAN STILL TAKE THAT DECISION TO ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES OF THEIR WRISTS SIX STEPS. THAT HAVE TO HAPPEN BEFORE AN OFFICER IS DEEMED. DECERTIFIED AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE ARE PLENTY CHECKS AND BALANCES HERE AND YES THERE ARE SOME NUANCES. CASE IN POINT I INDIVIDUAL WHO THE USERS OF THIS DESCRIPTION- A YEAR AGO OR SO. THERE WAS A- CRIMINAL WHO HELD A KNIFE TO A WOMAN'S THROAT ANY WAS THE BURDEN THAT SLIT HER THROAT AND IN THE PROCESS OF SELLING IT TO THIRD BAY TRIED TO SHOOT TO. THAT THE SUSPECT AND THEY KILLED THE WOMAN THAT OFF YOU SHOULDN'T LOSE HIS JOB FOR A SITUATION LIKE THAT SO THERE WILL BE CLEAR. DELINEATIONS ASKED WHAT IS DEAN ON LAWFUL AND WHAT IS THE TEAM IN THE LINE OF DOING THEIR JOB SO. I THINK TO CHECKS AND BALANCES THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ARE HERE IN THIS BILL AND AGAIN POLES TO HOUSE THE FINAL SAY AS WELL AS TO EVEN IF THE CITIZEN REVIEW COMMITTEE. THIS ARE. WELL TO THE SEARCHES TO REVIEW BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT ALSO MADE UP OF THE REVIEW COMMISSION. POLL STILL. HAS THE FINAL SAY TO REVIEW THEIR DECISION. SO THERE ARE THERE ARE. SIX FOR A OFFICER CAN BE DECERTIFIED IN YOU CAN REJECT CERTAIN ALL THOSE BASED ON NOT MEETING THIS CRITERION NO CERTIFICATION AND GET ALL THE WAY DOWN HERE AND AGAIN WE STILL HAVE A FINAL STEP WITH ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION SENATOR BRADFORD- ADDITIONALLY. I'M A STRONG BELIEVER IN FAIR TREATMENT UNDER THE LAW IN OUR COUNTRY WHICH COINCIDENCE COINCIDENTALLY IS WHY SUPPORT DESERTIFICATION PROCESS- HOWEVER DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. I THINK THAT ONLY HAVING TWO OF THE NINE MEMBERS WHO UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND CAN PROVIDE THE VALUABLE INSIGHT CREATES A SYSTEM THAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED AS UNFAIR- I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT AT NOT PROMOTE OUT MAKE UP OF THE OPPOSITE. A BOARD WITH SEVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED SEATS AND TO OUTSIDE ORGANIZATIONS AS THAT WOULD NOT BE A FAIR PROCESS FOR THE PUBLIC. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ANY WAYS TO MAKE THIS BOARD A LITTLE MORE BALANCED AND FAIR TO ENSURE THAT YES BUT OFFICERS ARE TO CERTIFIED IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS ALSO PROTECTED BUT ALSO THEY BRING THE OFFICERS GET A FAIR HEARING. I THINK THIS IS FAIR WE TRUST TWELVE LEHMAN FROM THE COMMUNITY SAID IN A JURY BOX AND DETERMINE ONCE A LIFE OR DEATH. EVERY DAY AND TRIALS BUT WE DON'T TRUST SEVEN CITIZENS TO REVIEW LAW ENFORCEMENT ALONG WITH. TWO POLICE OFFICERS TO PEOPLE WOULD LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUNDS WE HAVE NEGOTIATED- THAT COMBINATION OF WE'VE LAST YEAR WE HAD OFFERED FIVE AND FOUR. WE HAD SIX AND THREE NOTHING THE AGREED UPON SO WE'RE STARTING BACK WITH WHAT. OUR SUPPORTERS AND I WANT AND NOT SEVEN INTO WE THINK IT'S GOING TO BE FAIR THESE THE SEVEN CITIZENS ARE NOT. HELLO ARE YOU KNOW JUST PEOPLE WITH NO BACKGROUND WE WANT PEOPLE TO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE AT THIS SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A POLICE OFFICER DOESN'T MEAN THEY CANNOT. RENDER A FAIR DECISION THAT IS. COULD BE VERY WELL FAVORABLE PORT OFFICER SO I DON'T THINK BIASES IS THERE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF THE MAKE UP OF THIS COMMITTEES. NON SWORN POLICE OFFICERS. I THINK THE WAS MORE WE REGARD TO THE BACKGROUND THE QUALIFICATIONS THAT ARE BEING OUT POSTED ON THERE- INDIA IS A FULL TIME I THINK IT WAS JUST MORE IN THE BACKGROUND OF THE OF THE BOARD THIS IS. IN THE BACKGROUND PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUND BE TO BEHIND THEM I THINK THAT WAS MORE OF A CONCERN. I MEAN. WE'RE JUST NOT TAKING JOE BLOW OFF THE STREET AND HOUSE IN THE SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE SO- ARE THEY ON THIS COMMISSION SO. THERE WILL BE. EXPECTATIONS OF QUALIFICATIONS AN UNDERSTANDING IN ORDER TO BE CONSIDERED BUT YOU KNOW. TO SAY THAT YOU HAVE TO HAVE A LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUND IN ORDER TO SERVE ON THIS THING I TOTALLY DISAGREE WITH THAT- AND THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU IS WITH REGARDS TO QUALIFIED IMMUNITY. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THE CONCERN THAT THIS IS PART OF THIS OF THIS BILL AND THAT SHOULD BE ADDRESSED SEPARATELY I DON'T AGREE WITH IT I THINK QUALIFIED IMMUNITY I THINK IF YOU HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME IT'S GOING TO CHANGE YOUR- BEHAVIOR. IF WE ALL KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE HELD SO. PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR THE ACTIONS THAT WE TAKE. ARE YOU SURE YOU WE WILL THINK TWICE BEFORE TAKING BOTH WORLD ACTIONS. NOT THOSE ACTIONS THAT ARE SPLIT DECISION THAT REQUIRES YOU TO DO AND COMMON PLACE. LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT WHAT WE'VE SEEN. JUST IN THE LAST TWO DAYS. WHAT WE'VE SEEN. IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS. THE SITUATION IN WINDSOR. OF VIRGINIA I THINK WE WOULD ALL AGREE YOU HAVE A MILITARY OFFICER IN UNIFORM AND TO BE TREATED IN A WAY THAT HE'S BEEN TREATED IF THAT OFFICER WAS A MILITARY OFFICER WAS PERSONALLY INJURED IN THAT SCRIMMAGE WHY SHOULD THAT OFFICER BE HELD. PERSONALLY LIABLE WHEN IT WASN'T BASED ON POLICE CONDUCT AND COLD WHY SHOULD YOU BE LIABLE FOR ANY INJURY THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL CITIZENS. ENCOUNTERING DURING THAT ENCOUNTER I THINK I JUST THINK IT'S JUST. IT'S PART OF I THINK NEARING THE SCOPE OF BEHAVIOR IF YOU KNOW YOU'RE GONNA BE PERSONALLY LIABLE FOR. FOR YOUR ACTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD AND LAST THE CONCERN WITH REGARDS TO- THE PROCESS- LET'S SEE HERE. SOME MAY CONSTRUE THIS THAT THE PROCESS MAY NOT BE MIRROR OR SHARE I'M AS APPLY TO OTHER PROFESSIONS DO YOU FEEL DO YOU PERSONALLY FEEL THAT THIS PROCESS MIRRORS THAT OF OTHER PROFESSIONS IN THERE THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS. I THINK IT'S MORE SAFEGUARDS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT IT IS FOR BARBER OR BARBER CAN SHOW UP DRUNK. AND LOSE THEIR LICENSE. THAT DOESN'T APPLY TO A POLICE OFFICER RIGHT NOW YOU MIGT BE SUSPENDED MIGHT BE YOU KNOW DISCIPLINE BUT A BARBER CAN LOSE THEIR LICENSE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY SHOWEDUP AND DROP A BARBICAN LOSE THEIR LICENSE FOR FALSE ADVERTISEMENT. BUT A CERTAIN FOR YOU KNOW FOR TO. EVIDENCE AND YOU KNOW. IT'S TOUGH TO LIE AS WE LL KNOW THE WHO KNOWS SOME DUDE. AND THEN THEY SHOULD BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THAT SO I THINK THE SAFEGUARDS FOR- LAW ENFORCEMENT AS FAR AS- BEING CERTIFIED AS FAR STRICTER THAN THAT AGAIN OTHER A BARBER A DOCTOR A LAWYER TO BE DISBARRED. IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO SAVE FOR THOSE FOLKS TO LEGALIZE AND THEN OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSON AT. THE DECISION A LIFE AND DEATH IN THEIR HAND ON THE DAILY BASIS. SO I'M SORRY JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES YOU BELIEVE THAT THE PROCESSES ARE SIMILAR. IN THEIR SIMILAR AND THEN THEM BUT I THINK. IT'S MORE LEAD WAY WITH A LOT LAW LAW LAW ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW THAN IT IS WITH BARBER CITING AN APPARENTLY OBVIOUSLY WE DO HAVE A PROBLEM YEAH YOU DO HAVE A DOUBT. AND I AGREE WITH YOU I CONCUR WITH THAT- I ALSO NOTED THAT. YOU ARE CURRENTLY UNDER- NEGOTIATIONS WITH- BUT LAW ENFORCEMENT OR SAFETY OFFICERS IN REGARDS TO MAKING THIS BILL MORE- WHAT'S THE WORD MORE BALANCED OUT WITH THEM IS THAT CORRECT. I AM IN CONSTANT DIALOGUE WITH THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO HAVE A EARNERS CONVERSATION AND MOVING THIS. LEGISLATION FORD BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY COMING UP WITH A FAIR WAIT A TRANSPARENT WAY OF GETTING RID OF BAD COPS AND IF THAT SUBJECT OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT SUBJECT OF THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY I'M OPEN IN NEGOTIATIONS BUT MUCH OF THE DISCUSSION THAT IS SHARED AROUND THIS ISSUE HERE IN CALIFORNIA HAS IT BEEN ABOUT A REAL FAIR AND TRANSPARENT OPEN- PROCESS IT'S BEEN VERY ONE SIDED AND SO I'M OPEN TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT DIALOGUE I. HAD A VERY URGENT THE CONVERSATION YESTERDAY WITH A REPRESENTATIVE OF PPL STILL- I'M WILLING TO SIT DOWN WITH ANY OF THE FOLKS WHO WANT TO HAVE A CONVERSATION TO GET TO THAT COMMON GROUND OF SOMETHING THAT FEAR THAT PROVIDES TO PROCESS- TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BUT IT STOPS IS TRUST IN OUR COMMUNITY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LACKING RIGHT NOW TRUST SPECIALLY IN PEOPLE OF COLOR IN THE COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE OF COLOR SO THAT'S WORTH. LOOKING TO FIND A BALANCE. THE YOU SENATOR PER A I RESPECT AND I CAN HEAR THE PASSION. IN YOUR VOICE. I'M A NEW MEMBER FROM THIS AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND I HAVE TO SAY- IT'S BEEN A LEARNING EXPERIENCE FOR ME AND WORKING WITH- WITH ALL OF YOU. I AM NOT GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I KNOW THAT IT'S CURRENTLY WORKING IN IN PROGRESS BUT I WOULD LOVE TO BE A PART OF YOUR OF YOUR TEAM AND WORK TOWARDS THE BALANCE OF THIRTY BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT WE DO NEED REFORM. AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE FOUNDATION OF THIS BILL AND WHERE IT'S MOVING FORWARD TO AND I WOULD VERY MUCH APPRECIATE TO BE A PART OF THE PROCESS. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD YES SENATOR KAMLAGER THINGS M. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I WOULD JUST LIKE TO- IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASKED WHICH I THINK ARE REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW AS YOU WERE- ASKING ABOUT THE BACKGROUND OF- THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE COMMISSION IT STRUCK ME THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY OF US THAT SERVE IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND VERY FEW OF US COME FROM A BACKGROUND OF LEGISLATIVE WORK. WHAT WE DO IS WE ARE A DIVERSE GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS. THAT REPRESENT ALL OF THE DIVERSITY OF THIS STATE AND WE BRING OUR UNIQUE PERSPECTIVES. AND ARE DIFFERENT WORK HISTORIES AND EXPERIENCES TO THE TABLE AND I BELIEVE THAT WE USE. THOSE EXPERIENCES ON THOSE VERY DIFFERENT BACKGROUNDS. TO REALLY COLOR IN THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE AROUND POLICY. AND I THINK THAT IS. A SIMILAR INTENT FOR THIS COMMISSION. I THINK IT ALLOWS FOR THERE TO BE MORE OPEN MINDED DISCUSSIONS AND FOR THEIR TO BE FRESH APPROACHES TO HOW DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIONS ARE REVIEWED- AND EVEN INVESTIGATED AND DISCUSSED. OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE EVERYONE YOU KNOW FROM THE SAME- SPACE TALKING WE END UP HAVING GROUP THINK WE END UP USING ACRONYMS AND WE FALL INTO A COMFORT ZONE THAT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES TO BE SHARED. I THINK YOU KNOW HAVING SOMEONE WITH A SOCIAL WORKER EXPERIENCE OR SOMEONE WHO IS A NURSE OR SOMEONE WHO IS A CAREGIVER FOR SOMEONE WHO IS A PASTOR- COULD PROBABLY BRING A DIFFERENT AND FRESH PERSPECTIVE. TO THE DISCUSSIONS WERE HAVING AROUND WHAT PUBLIC SAFETY MEANS WHAT EXCESSIVE FORCE LOOKS LIKE HOW IT IS PERCEIVED SO I THINK WE SHOULD AND I'M ALSO SAYING THIS TO THE OPPOSITION PUT A LITTLE FAITH. IN THE PUBLIC THAT WE ALL WANT YOU KNOW THE SAME. GOOD TO FEEL SAFE AND THAT HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU HAVE A CONSTELLATION OF DIFFERENT IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES- LENDING THEMSELVES TO THE DECISION MAKING PROCESS- FOR THIS COMMISSION THAT SOMETHING WILL HAPPEN THAT IS FAIR- I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. THE OPPOSITION TO REMEMBER THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT. IT COMES FULLY CLOAKED WITH FULL REPRESENTATION THEY ARE UNION MEMBERS THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT OF THEIR UNION THEY OFTEN ARE GIVEN ACCESS TO COUNCIL IMMEDIATELY- WHEN AN INVESTIGATION IS STARTED- POPE ARE IS STILL VERY MUCH IN AFFECT. AND SO THE SYSTEM AS IT CURRENTLY STANDS REALLY STILL DOES AIR ON THE SIDE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO GIVE THEM AMPLE PROTECTION BECAUSE I THINK IN THE GRAND DESIGN IN THE BEGINNING PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD THAT THESE ARE- DANGEROUS JOBS- AND THAT FOLKS WHO ARE COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO DO THEM. ACTUALLY DO DESERVE SUPPORT AND SO I ALSO WANT US TO BE REALLY MINDFUL OF THAT AND THE GOAL IS NOT TO. RELIEVE FOLKS OF ANY PROTECTIONS BUT IT IS TO ADD ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF TRANSPARENCY AND- UNBIASED OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO OFTENTIMES IT'S THE SAME SMALL GROUP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS VETERAN TO ENGAGE. IN THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT ULTIMATELY- SPREAD I THINK FEAR AND DISCONTENT AND LOW MORALE BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO WITHIN THE RANKS AND SO HOW DO WE FIND A WAY TO INCISIVE LEO ATTACK. ON THOSE KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT IS DEALING WITH IN A WAY THAT KEEPS DEPARTMENTS HOLD BUT ALSO GIVES PROTECTION OFTENTIMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO DON'T HAVE THE COURAGE OFTEN TO HANDLE THE BAD ACTORS THAT ARE IN THEIR OWN DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE OF THE CULTURE. THAT IS REALLY SO PERVASIVE AND SOMETIMES OPPRESSIVE SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THOSE THOUGHTS IN RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU REYES TO THE CHAIR. AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. SENATOR FROM LARGER I IF YOUR HEARING AND I ATE AN EGG- I YOUR STATE YOU'VE MADE THANK YOU- AND YET COMMENTS. CAN IN THE EFFORTS OF TIME WE'RE GONNA. WE HAVEN'T FROM SENATOR WE TO MOVE BILL- CONSULTING YOU MIND CALLING THE WORLD PLEASE CAN I CLOSE SORRY I APOLOGIZE HE SAID HEARD ABOUT. AND ABOUT WHICH ART I WOULD HAVE ALLOWED US CALL AUGUST TO SERVICE MY CLOTHES BECAUSE I THINK SHE HAD TO KNOW ON THE HEAD. BUT I DID TO ADDRESS QUESTION I MISSED THERE IS A YEAR ONE FROM THE IN THE- STARTS TO IT HAS TO BE. TILL AGAIN. THAT'LL THAT'LL THAT BATTLE TIME BIG CHAU- IT'S NOT WE'RE THIS TO OFFICERS DOWN GET A CHANCE IS THEM SO. BUT AS USED. THIS DOES NOT COME FROM A POSITION OF ANTI COP WHATSOEVER. THE IS A- POLICING. MEASURE THAT MAKES OUR COMMUNITY SAFER WE ALL WE WILL. MEN WHEN WHO FOR THE UNIT. THE CITIZENS AS AS A WHOLE. WHY SAFE TRUSTWORTHY POLICE OFFICER INTERNET. THAT ALL WE'RE FOR HERE. AND I COME FROM LEVEL OF ITS- THAT NO I'M NOT A LONG SHOULD HAVE BEEN ON. BUT I HAVE FAMILY WHO FUNDING IMPACT UNCLE. THIRTY PLUS. MILITARY OFFICER. I AM I. BEST FRIEND FROM. JUNE HIGH JUST READ FROM A- AFTER THE FIVE. PRESIDENT THE. SURE DORSEY IF LAPD OFFICER- GOOD FRIEND OF MINE- GO ON AND ON AND ON I HAVE FOR WHO ARE LINE FOR IN THE ALL. THE HARDER THING TO IN LAW FOR IS TO GET RID OF A BAD COP. THE STAFF THE HARDEST THING TO DO IS TO GET RID OF A BAD COP AND MAKE ALL ADS ARE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION STATED. BAY TO WANT TO GET RID OF BAD COPS. BUT THE- BARRIERS. THAT EXIST MAKE IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE AND I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF THIRTEEN HUNDRED PLUS. SHOOTINGS IN THE LAST DECADE DO YOU HAVE ANY IDEA THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO WERE BROUGHT UP ON CHARGES. TEN THIRTEEN HUNDRED SHOOTINGS TEN OF THE STAND HOW MANY WERE CONVICTED. ONE TELL ME WHAT PROFESSION GET TO THE RIGHT THAT MANY TIMES THAT OFTEN NO DOCTOR NO LAWYER NO TEACHER NO ELECTED OFFICIAL NO ONE GETS A DIRECT SO AGAIN THE BARRIERS TO PROTECT OFFICERS HAVE BEEN NEAR IN THE CONTINUE TO BE THERE AND ALL WE'RE SEEING IS LET'S RESET THIS. MORE GOALS IN OBJECTIVES REALLY TO GET RID OF BACK CAUGHT HERE IS A METHOD IN WHICH WE CAN DO IT. IS A PERFECT NOW BUT WE'RE WORKING AT THAT WOULD BUT WHAT EXISTS RIGHT NOW IS FAR FROM PERFECT. AND IT'S TRULY NOT TRUSTWORTHY. AND ESPECIALLY IF YOU COME FROM A- COMMUNITY OF BLACK AND BROWN. AND I WOULD JUST IN WITH THIS. OSCAR GRANT RODNEY KING HE'S L. FOR STOP ON CLARK RON SETTLES YOU WILL LOVE THE JOHN KINSEY ANDRES GUARDADO KENNETH ROTH JUNIOR CHAU MONTERROSA ERIC SAGA.

MOST OF THESE OFFICERS THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME. BUT THEY'RE STILL ON POLICE DEPARTMENTS BUT THE MAJORITY OF THE FOLKS THAT WERE INVOLVED IN THESE. INCIDENTS AND ALL WE'RE JUST TRYING TO SAY IS HOW DO WE GET RID OF THE BAD APPLES SO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT ON THAT UNIFORM EVERY DAY WHICH IS 99% OF THOSE FOLKS WHO. TAKE THE OLD TO DO THEIR JOB HOW ARE THE- ALLOWED TO BE TRUSTED. AND MAKE THEIR JOB EASIER AND MAKE THEM SAFER WHEN THEY'RE ON THE STREET AND I THINK.

YOU'LL ARCHIVE THIS LATER WON'T YOU. I'LL BE ABLE TO SEE THE VIDEO. BECAUSE IT SEEMS A LITTLE ODD TO ME THAT THIS IS GETTING LEGISLATIVE TODAY. AND YOU DON'T HAVE A PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. BECAUSE I'M NOT REALLY EDUCATED TO BE TALKING ABOUT THIS ELECTIONS ISN'T MY- WE DON'T HOUSES SO TO SPEAK. BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS IS THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE. I KNOW THAT THE CONSTITUTION STILL MATTERS I KNOW THAT THERE WERE A HUNDRED PEOPLE WAITING IN LINE TODAY OUTSIDE THE BUILDING TO GET INTO THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND YOU DENIED THEM ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING WHICH IS WHY I'M STANDING HERE SUDDENLY ACTING AS YOUR PRIMARY WITNESS.

AND CURRENTLY HAVE NO ONE QUEUING UP THANK YOU MODERATOR HAVING NO TAKERS WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS SENATOR WIENER. I YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK FILTER ALL THE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY ONE THING I DO JUST WANT TO MENTION AYE AYES HAVE MEANT TO CALL YOU- AT THE TIME I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT. HAVING A OPPORTUNITY. WHICH IS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER- I TOTALLY SUPPORT WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO DO. WITH THE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY. WE HAVE- A SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A VERY. ODD TIMES PART OF CALIFORNIA- FREQUENTLY THE LEGISLATURE SETS. DISTANCES THAT ARE. IRRESPECTIVE OF DENSITY AND THAT FRANKLY ARE. MORE FLEXIBLE AND MORE SUBURBAN. SETTINGS AND THAT MAY HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IN VERY DENSELY POPULATED. URBAN AREAS AND SO WE SEE THIS IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. TWO HUNDRED FEET AND- DENSE URBAN SETTING. CAN ACTUALLY BE QUITE. SIGNIFICANT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN SAY A SUBURBAN SETTING WHERE YOU'RE VOTING AT A SCHOOL OR A CHURCH OR OR WHATEVER WERE IT DOESN'T IF YOU'RE STILL IN THE PARKING LOT BY THE TIME YOU GET TO TWO HUNDRED FEET. AND IN A DENSE URBAN SETTING IF YOU HAVE A- A DROP BOX OR A BOAT OR A VOTING- STATION. THAT IS NEAR LIKE A COMMERCIAL CORPORATE OR IT COULD MEAN PATERNITY COULD EVEN INTENDS INTO AN AREA WHERE EVERYONE WOULD WOULD SAY THAT THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO CAMPAIGN OR EVEN TO REALLY CENTRAL AREA WHERE WE WOULD FRANK YOU WANT PEOPLE. TO BE CAMPAIGNING SO I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE IF YOU COULD. TO CONSIDER I MAYBE YOU AND I COULD. TRY ABOUT AT SOME POINT I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOLVABLE. IN THIS BILL BUT- THAT'S AN ONGOING ISSUE. IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AREAS AND I SEE IT POTENTIALLY BEING A PROBLEM HERE. MISTER SHALL RESPOND RESULT IF YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE CHAIR YES. SURE THE SENATE LEADER I TAKE YOUR POINT PARTICULARLY IN PLACE LIKE SAN FRANCISCO- THE CHALLENGES IS THAT IN THE LAST ELECTION WHERE WE HAD FOLKS WHO ARE LINED UP TO CLEARLY LATE IN THE EVENING. BEYOND A HUNDRED FEET U TO TWO HUNDRED FEET OF AND THE FOLKS THAT YOU KNOW THE HUNDRED FIFTY FOOT MARKER BEING HARASSED SO- IF YOU IF YOU'VE GOT A FORMULA FOR DENSE AREAS UP I'M HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN IT. BUT THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING IN LONG LINES AREN'T BEING ACCOSTED BY THOSE WHO HAVE A PARTICULAR POINT OF VIEW- WITH RESPECT TO THAT ELECTION. YEAH AND  DON'T KNOW JACK TO OPEN MY EYES I THINK UNLESS I'M MISINTERPRETING THE BILL EVEN IF NO ONE IS ONLINE AT THE TIME THE TWO HUNDRED FEET WOULD STILL. APPLY AND SO. WE CAN TALK AND- IT MIGHT NOT BE SELLABLE AND MORE THAN ANYTHING I'M JUST LOGGING- THIS ISSUE AND WE CAN. CHAT ABOUT IT LATER I APPRECIATE. THANK YOU. VERY IN ADDITION QUESTION OR CONCERNS. SENATOR OF TROUBLE. THANK YOU SENATOR UMBERG THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I HAD A QUESTION IF I'M ACTUALLY MORE OF A CONCERN SO I'M THINKING OF MY COMMUNITY- AND JUST BEFORE I GO FORWARD- WITH REGARD TO SENATOR AT WINNERS- QUESTION OR CONCERN- WOULD IT BE FEASIBLE TO DO SOMETHING WITHIN THE BILL THAT SAYS ONE HUNDRED OR TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM THE LAST PERSON IN LINE THAT WAY IT ACCOMMODATES THAT. WHATEVER THE DISTANCE MAYBE- WITHOUT GET CONSIDERATION THAT MAYBE REPORT. IT WHAT WE DID CONSIDER THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT. IT DOESN'T GIVE THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS A CLEAR DEMARCATION LINE SO FOR EXAMPLE AT TEN O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING IT MAY BE TWO HUNDRED FEET FROM THE ENTRANCE TO THE BUILDING IN WHICH THE VOTE IS HAPPENING WHERE YOU'RE CASTING YOUR BALLOT. AREAS LATER ON IN THE DAY IT MADE IT MAY BE DIFFERENT AS PEOPLE LINE UP OUTSIDE SO IF YOU ADJUSTED BY THE LENGTH OF THE LINE- WEEK WE COULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER WE THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT- THE REGISTRARS NEED CLEAR DEFINITION. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE- ENFORCE THE LAW. SO IF THERE'S SOME OF THAT THERE'S SOME OTHER PERMUTATION THAT WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED I'M OPEN TO IT. SOME MAY BE WITHIN A HUNDRED FEET UNLESS YOU KNOW THE LINE EXTENDS FURTHER THAN THAT THEN IT'S TWO HUNDRED FEET OR A HUNDRED FEET FROM THAT- JUST TAKE JUST A CONSIDERATION AT GOOD POINT THOUGH I AND- I DIDN'T HAVE CONSIDER THAT BUT I DO CONSIDER- LOCATIONS SUCH AS- AROUND MY NEIGHBORHOOD WE HAVE A SENIOR. FACILITIES THAT- BECOME- DROP OFF PLACES FOR VOTING PLACES FOR POLLING PLACES FOR OUR COMMUNITY. AND I NOTICED ENSURE THAT WITHIN THIS BILL IT SAYS THAT- YOU WOULD. POTENTIALLY NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANY SORT OF PRESENTATIONS CAMPAIGNING OR ANY OF THE SEARCH FOR THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO- UNDERSTANDING OUR SENIORS AND THE COMMUNITIES WHICH WHICH- OBVIOUSLY- DUE TO THE TIMING AND- TYPE OF INFORMATION THEY NEED INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND AS- YOU KNOW SOON BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT JUST BECOMES VERY DISTANT AND- AND- YOU KNOW THEY FOR THE FORGET- IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU COULD TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AS TO THE FACILITIES. SUCH AS SENIOR FOR CITY FACILITIES- IN THE IN THE IN THIS IN THIS BILL- MISTER CHAIR TO THE CHAIR. IS YOURS FONG- THE PURPOSES SO FOR EXAMPLE- THE- STATE DEMARCATION IS FOR EXAMPLE FOR DROPBOX IF YOU'RE DROPPING OFF THIRTY DAYS AHEAD OF TIME IT'S NOT FOR A VOTE CENTER WHICH MAY ONLY BE OPEN FOR DAYS AT A TIME BUT WE'LL LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE. BUT WE DON'T WANT IT IS WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE STANDING BEFORE AND AROUND DROP BOXES- TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY ARE TRYING TO CAST THEIR BALLOT THAT SO WE DON'T WANT. AND AS AS WAS ILLUSTRATED BY THE- WITNESS FROM A NEVADA COUNTY THE THAT THAT IS A REAL CONSIDERATION. OKAY AND- YOU SEE. AND AS FAR AS MAKING- SO THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE HERE IS THAT IT CRIMINALIZES- ELECTIONEERING BEAT WITHIN TWO HUNDRED FEET AND ARE ON THE BALLOT DROP BOXES BUT MORE CONSISTENT MORE- TO THE POINT IS THAT. THEY'RE CERTAINLY GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT ARE NOT AWARE OF THE ABERRATIONS WHO FINDS US WEEKS LATER BEFORE AN ELECTION WEARING. OTHERWISE JUST PLAYING YOU KNOW- CANDID OR CAMPAIGN IT PARAPHERNALIA ADAM. BUT THERE THE FINES AND THE IS THERE LIKE A WARNING THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE TO GIVE SOMEONE BEFORE MOVING FORWARD WITH PENALTIES. WELL THIS DOESN'T CREATE NEW PENALTIES WHAT THIS DOES IS IT FURTHER DEFINES SO FOR EXAMPLE INTERFERING WITH ELECTION. SAME THING WITH THE ZONE IT EXPANDS UP FROM ONE HUNDRED FEET TO TWO HUNDRED FEET IT DOESN'T CREATE A NEW STATUTES WITH NEW PENALTIES. BOB CAN'T CAN FOLKS BE GIVEN A WARNING AND I RECOGNIZE THAT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE. TOO MUCH DISCRETION TO THOSE WHO WOULD BE ENFORCING THE LAW. BUT THERE THERE THERE IS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH HERE SO. IF FOR EXAMPLE SOMEONE IS A HUNDRED NINETY NINE FEET AWAY FROM A DROP BOX TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE ELECTION THERE IS NOTHING ELSE GOING ON AND THEY HAPPENED WE WEARING IT NUMBER BUTTON. I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE ARRESTED BUT THE DEMARCATION LINE THE DISTANCE ACTUALLY DOES GIVE. THE REGISTRAR'S OF THOSE ARE CONDUCTING ELECTION A- A DEFINITE SORT OF RADIUS SO THAT SO THAT PEOPLE CAN BE AWARE OF WHAT AREAS WHICH THEY CAN ELECTION YEAR WHAT YEAR IS THE CAMP ALEXION IN- AND SO THAT TO YOUR POINT ABOUT. YOU KNOW SOMEBODY RUNNING AFOUL OF THE LAW NOT BEING AWARE. OF REGISTERED VOTERS CAN ACTUALLY- DESIGNATE WHAT AREAS. YOU CANNOT ELECTION HERE. OKAY AND I'M KIND OF CURIOUS- I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DO HAVE IN OPPOSITION FROM THE ELECTION INTEGRITY PROJECT CALIFORNIA HAVE YOU BEEN WORKING WITH THEM IN IN WITH BECAUSE WITH THEIR WITH- WITH REGARDS THEIR CONCERNS TO THE BILL- I HAVE NOT. OKAY- CAN I ASK WHAT THE CONCERNS ARE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF EIGHT OF THEM. IT'S A IT'S A POINT IN TIME I'M SURE THAT WE'LL FIND COMMON GROUND ON ON SOME ISSUE- BUT THE GROUP BELIEVES THAT THE ELECTION WAS STOLEN THE GROUP BELIEVES IT WAS RAMPANT FRAUD THE GROUP BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE. YOU KNOW LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS A REGISTRY LEGALLY AND I TYPICALLY DON'T BUY INTO THEIR THEIR THEIR VIEWS BUT I'M SURE AT SOME POINT TIME WILL FIND COMMON GROUND ON SOMETHING. THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BYE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. M. C.

TWO NINE NINE WHICH WOULD EXPAND THE UNIVERSE OF CLAIMANTS ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENTS AS VICTIMS OF CRIME FROM THE CALIFORNIA RESTITUTION FUND TO PERSONS WHO ARE VICTIMS OF CRIME SB TWO NINETY NINE WOULD EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF CRIME TO INCLUDE ANY USE OF FORCE BY A PEACE OFFICER THAT RESULTS IN SERIOUS BODILY INJURY OR DEATH REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE PEACE OFFICER IS ARRESTED FOR CHARGED OR CONVICTED OF COMMITTING A CRIME. IN FACT THIS BILL WOULD DIRECT THE CALIFORNIA RESTITUTION FUND AWAY FROM CRIME VICTIMS FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE ITS CREATION IN NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE SINCE THE BILL WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT A CRIME HAS BEEN CONVICTED COMMITTED IN ORDER TO MAKE RESTITUTION AS DRAFTED THE BILL DOORS THE REALITY THAT USE OF FORCE BY PEACE OFFICERS IS MOST OFTEN LAWFUL AND JUSTIFIED NOT CRIMINAL AS WE READ THE BILL A CLAIMANT SERIOUSLY INJURED BY A PEACE OFFICER IS ENTITLED TO VICTIM COMPENSATION REGARDLESS OF THE CLAIMANTS CONDUCT IN THE NET IN AN INCIDENT. UNLESS THE CLAIMANT IS CONVICTED OF A CRIME FOR INFLICTING GREAT BODILY INJURY OR DEATH DURING THE SAME PRINCIPLE AS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF HOME INVASION ROBBER WHO RUNS OUT THE BACK DOOR SHOOTS AT POLICE OFFICERS BUT UNIFORMS AND GO IN TURN GETS WOUNDED BY POLICE AND RETURNED FIRE IS ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION INTENDED FOR TRUE VICTIMS OF CRIME SUCH A SCENARIO STAND THE PURPOSE OF THIS FUND ON IT AT. THE BILL ALSO AUTHORIZES COMPENSATION TO THE FAMILY OF A PERSON KILLED BY A POLICE OFFICER REGARDLESS OF THE DECEDENT'S CONDUCT IN THE INCIDENT. THAT BROUGHT ABOUT HIS OR HER DEATH. IN CENTER THE TO THE FIFTEEN. ASSAULT AND SAMBERG'S CAL. WERE TO PERPETRATE MURDER OR PEOPLE. THESE ARE ATTEMPTING TO ARREST THE SHOOTER IS WORKING. WITH GUNFIRE. AND SOME OFFICERS WOUNDED BEFORE THE POLICE. PREVAIL IN THE GUN BY. AGAIN AS WE READ THE BILL. FOR VICTIMS. ON BEHALF OF THE PERPETRATORS WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID. THE RESTITUTION FUND HAS BEEN OPERATING UNDER A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT FOR SEVERAL YEARS. DO WE REALLY WANT TO DENY PAYMENTS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE TRULY BEEN VICTIMS OF CRIME. IN ORDER TO PAY THOSE WHO MAY HAVE BEEN PERPETRATORS OF CRIME. AGAIN THE BILL PROPOSES PAYING PRESSURES AND INCREASINGLY SCARCE RESTITUTION FUNDS TO INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN A JUDGE BY ANY COURT. WHO HAVE BEEN VICTIMS OF CRIME AND IN FACT MAY HAVE BEEN PERPETRATORS OF THE CRIME BECAUSE THEIR INJURIES. BUT WAS NEVER THE INTENTION OF THIS PROGRAM. AND WE URGE A NO VOTE.

ARE I DON'T SEE SENATOR JONES WHAT I DO SEE CENTER CORTESE IF YOU'RE PREPARED WE WILL. LET YOU PROCEED NEXT. DO WE NEED TO DO ANY HOUSEKEEPING- SERGEANT. FIVE ARE FILE ITEM FIVE SB. THREE EIGHT THREE BY SENATOR CORTESE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND SENATORS SOME I YES I'M HERE TO PRESENT ON SB THREE EIGHTY THREE THE JUVENILE DIVERSION ACT OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. SB THREE TWO THREE SIX TO EXPAND THE REHABILITATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR YOUTHWHO COMMIT NONVIOLENT FELONIES BY INCREASING ACCESS TO DIVERSION PROGRAMS BUT BY DOING THIS WE CAN ENSURE THAT A SPECIALIZED SOLUTION IS PROVIDED FOR YOUTH INSTEAD OF A ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH. IN TWO THOUSAND THE PASSAGE OF PROP TWENTY ONE GREATLY LIMITED ELIGIBILITY FOR JUVENILE DIVERSION HOWEVER MODERN DAY RESEARCH ON ADOLESCENT BEHAVIOR AND BRAIN DEVELOPMENT CONFIRM THE- YOUTH MATTERS IN THAT YOU SHOULD BE TREATED DIFFERENTLY THAN ADULTS SB THREE EIGHTY THREE FALLS THIS RESEARCH BY MAKING USE CHARGED WITH FELONIES THAT ARE NOT SERIOUS AND NOT VIOLENT. ELIGIBLE FOR INFORMAL SUPERVISION ADDITIONALLY SB THREE THREE ENSURES A YOUTH ALLEGED TO HAVE SOLD OR POSSESSED FOR SALE CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE ARE NOT EXCLUDED. FROM RECEIVING INFORMAL SUPERVISION SB THREE EIGHTY THREE ALSO REMOVES UNNECESSARY PROCEDURAL BARRIERS. TO ALLOW USE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF THE USE NEEDS AN APPROPRIATE OFFER INFORMAL SUPERVISION THROUGH DIVERSION PROGRAM. FOR SB THREE THREE ENSURES THAT INDIGENT YOUTH ARE NOT DENIED ELIGIBILITY FOR DIVERSION PROGRAMS. SIMPLY DUE TO THEIR INABILITY TO MAKE RESTITUTION PAYMENT. MANY OF THESE LAWS STEM FROM A TOUGH ON CRIME PERIOD WHERE THESE YOUTH WERE OFTEN LABELED AS SUPER PREDATORS. AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE NOW KNOW THE HARSH SENTENCES INCREASED PUNISHMENTS ESPECIALLY FOR YOUTH DOES VERY LITTLE TO MITIGATE CRIME. INSTEAD OF THESE KIND OF LAWS THE CURRENT LAWS CREATE A COMMERCIAL SOCIETY THAT DEHUMANIZES THOSE HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF CRIMES WE MUST CONTINUE TO RIGHT THIS WRONG. HERE TO TESTIFY TODAY- OVER THE PHONE OR MULTIPLE OPEN THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING THEM I SHOULD SAY AND JUDGE LYNN EDWARDS LETTERED AND WORDS I SHOULD SAY WAS ON THE LINE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. MISTER CHAIR THAT WOULD CONCLUDE MY PRESENTATION- CENTER PRESHEAF PRESENTATION MISS RELOAD ARE YOU PREPARED. I AM THANK YOU SENATOR I AM MIKE BELOW DONE BEHALF OF THE JUVENILE COURT JUDGES OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS A SECTION OF THE CALIFORNIA JUDGES ASSOCIATION ALSO WITH ME TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AT LEAST WITH ME REMOTELY IS JUDGE PLAN EDWARDS OF VERY RESPECTED JUVENILE COURT JUDGE FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY. ABOUT SORT OF CORTESE NOTED THERE'S REALLY THREE ELEMENTS OF THE BILL- OUT TO BE THE SPONSOR AND VERY. TO HAVE ACHIEVED THE SUPPORT BY A DIVERSE RANGE OF THE GROUPS INCLUDING C. A. C. J. AND THE- CHEAP PROBATION OFFICERS OF CALIFORNIA BUT REALLY THREE ELEMENTS FIRST- CLEANING UP THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN FOR A USER WHO IS. A RESIDENT OF ONE COUNTY AND IS ARRESTED IN ANOTHER THAT ALLOWING THE COUNTY OF RESIDENCE. ORDER DIVERSION IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES SO THAT YOUTH DOESN'T GET LOST BETWEEN THE TWO COUNTIES. SECOND CLARIFYING THAT MERE INDIGENOUS IS NOT A BASIS FOR DENYING INFORMAL PROVISIONS FOR FINDING THAT THE U. FAILED TO COMPLETE SUPERVISION. AND FINALLY ALLOWING FOR IN CERTAIN FORMAL SUPERVSION OF NONVIOLENT NON SERIOUS FELONIES. IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES WE'VE HAD A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE REPUBLICAN CONSULTANT ON THIS POINT. IF THERE IS ANY- THE NECESSARY AMENDMENTS AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS OUR INTENT IS FIRST TIME NONVIOLENT NON SERIOUS OFFENDERS IN APPROPRIATE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE THINK THIS WILL GIVE COURTS. THE ABILITY TO MAKE THE RIGHT TOUCH FOR YOU. IN A BEGIN- IN ACCORD WITH THE NEW RECOMMENDED PRACTICES. AND WE THINK IT WILL ALSO REDUCE DISPARITIES FOR YOUNG PEOPLE OF COLOR- AND AVOID OF SO CALLED JUSTICE BY GEOGRAPHY PROBLEM. I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR REFER THEM TO JUDGE EDWARDS AND WOULD AGAIN RESPECTFULLY. ASK FOR AT NIGHT. THANK YOU. JUDGE DREDD WHICH THREE. AM I ON MUTE RIGHT NOW. WE CAN HEAR WE'VE GOT- OUR- A SHOT AS YOU CAN. GEORGE HAVE YOU TAKEN ME OFF MUTE YET. WE CAN HEAR YOU. SOMEONE PUT ME ON MUTE AND I HAVE TO SPEAK TO YOU IS THIS JUDGE- WORDS WE CAN HEAR YOU- YOU CAN'T COLLECT GREAT. BOB THIS IS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT BILL FOR THE JUVENILE COURT AND THE YOUNGSTERS WHO APPEAR IN THAT COURT- I'M SPEAKING FOR A UNANIMOUS. UNIVERSAL COURT JUDGE SUPPORT. WITH THESE OF THE JUDGES WHO SEE THESE KIDS COME THROUGH. AND FOR THE NON VIOLENT YOUNGSTERS FIRST TIMERS WE WANT THE DISCRETION TO KEEP THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE THIS FULLY AS THE ANNIE E. CASEY. REPORT CALLED THE TRANSFORMING JUVENILE PROBATION. RECOMMENDED THAT WE LOCKED GATHER IN YOUNGSTERS WHO DON'T NEED TO BE THERE. AND THE INFORMAL SUPERVISION IS NEVER THE LESS SUPERVISION BUT IT DOESN'T GET THEM ENTANGLED IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND SO WE THINK THIS IS VERY SENSIBLE. THIS IS A GOOD STATUTES THAT JUVENILE COURT JUDGES EMBRACE AND I SHOULD JUST THAT AS A SIDE NOTE THAT THERE IS NO ORE CONFUSING AREA IN THE LAW THE JUVENILE COURT LAW. THEN ONE. CRIME OCCURS IN ONE COURT AND THE COURT IS HERE'S IN ONE COUNTY AND THEN THE COURT HEARS THE MATTER IN ANOTHER COUNTY I GUARANTEED THAT THERE'S ALWAYS CONFUSION IN THOSE CASES THIS LEGISLATION WILL HELP THAT SITUATION OUT. SIGNIFICANTLY SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'LL BE GLAD TO ANSWER THEM BUT I AM VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS BILL AND ASK THAT YOU. VOTE HI.

IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR WINNER CENTER CHOI BOGUE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST- FOR THE RETURNEES SPEAK I WOULD FIRST LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE FORWARD. I HAVE A HEART FOR PEOPLE AB FOR YOUNG PEOPLE WHO GET CAUGHT UP IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM OFTENTIMES THESE CHILDREN ARE VICTIMS OF CIRCUMSTANCES AND RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING AT THIS STAGE- I AM A HUGE FAN OF DOCTOR RISEN DIE WHO IS. FROM SAN FRANCISCO AND HAS WRITTEN SEVERAL BOOKS ON THE MALE AND THE FEMALE BRAIN AND EXPLAINS IN THAT BOOK. HOW THE BRAINS ARE AFFECTED- THE HORMONES AND CHEMICALS OF FACT. THE BRAIN IN THE THOUGHT PROCESS AT THAT STAGE- AND I AM ALSO A STRONG BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF REDEMPTION. AND ESPECIALLY BELIEVE THAT CHILDREN ARE WORTHY OF SECOND CHANCES. GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE JUSTICE SYSTEM CAN JEOPARDIZE EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND CAN ALSO CAUSE TRAUMA STRESS AND HAVE EFFECTIVE FURTHER PUSHING THESE CHILDREN DOWN THE PATH OF CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR. I SUPPORT THE INTENDED GOALS OF THIS BILL SAID- BY THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS TO GIVE JUDGES THE OPTION OF. OFFERING INFORMAL SUPERVISION T. TO HAVE MADE A FIRST TIME MISTAKE. HOWEVER I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH BROAD THE BROAD NATURE F THE OFFENSES THAT WOULD QUALIFY UNDER THIS BILL. SPECIFICALLY I HAVE CONCERNS WITH REMOVING THE REQUIREMENT FOR UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. FOR SOME OF THE CRIMES THAT FALL UNDER WELFARE AND INSTITUTIONS CODE SEVEN OF SEVEN B. INCLUDING THINGS LIKE MURDER RAPE KIDNAPPING. WHICH SEEM TO BE THE EXACT CASES IN WHICH WE WOULD WANT TO ONLY QUALIFY TO ONLY QUALIFY UNDER UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES- AND I HAVE A QUESTION. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO WORK ON LANGUAGE MOVING FORWARD TO KEEP THE CURRENT UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIREMENT IN PLACE FOR SOME OF THESE MORE EQUALLY JUST CASES. I'M SORRY IT'S SINKING THE DIALOGUE GOING- I'M NOT CLEAR OTHER THAN- CREATING DISCRETION THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW ANY RISK OF THE BILL OF THOSE SERIOUS AND VIOLENT- FELONIES YOU KNOW COMING UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THIS DIRECTION IN THIS BILL BUT IT'S CERTAINLY BE. IF IT'S A- IT'S THE TERRORISTS- PURVIEW TODAY I'M HAPPY TO DEFER TO JUDGE PLAN EDWARDS WHO- OF THIS WORKS EXTENSIVELY UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN THE SPECIFIC AREA THAT YOU'RE- YOU KNOW THAT YOUR- YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SENATOR- SO IF THAT'S WE CANNOT TURN TO. A YES TO CHAIRED IN GEORGIA WHICH WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTIONS. THE JUDGE TO ONLINE OR. ONE MOMENT PLEASE SO I WILL TAKE L. I WILL CHECK. HELLO. THAT EDWARDS PLEASE GO AHEAD OKAY THANK YOU BOB THAT WAS A VERY GOOD QUESTION- AND DOES SENATOR AND WE'RE CERTAINLY RESPONSIVE TO THAT YOU JUST AS UNDER CURRENT LAW SERIOUS AND VIOLENT FELONIES ON THE SEVEN OH SEVEN B. THE LIST HAVE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION OF THE INELIGIBILITY FOR INFORMAL SUPERVISION UNDER SB THREE EIGHTY THREE THE COURT CAN REBUT THAT PRESUMPTION BY FINDING THAT THE VERSION WOULD BE IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE. AND INTEREST OF JUSTICE ANALYSIS IS PRACTICALLY DRIVEN AND CASE SPECIFIC AND REQUIRES AN ANALYSIS UP NOT JUST THE UK NEEDS BUT ALSO THE INTERESTS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE VICTIM'S PERSPECTIVE ONLY THE COURT CAN READ BUT THE PRESUMPTION NOT THE PROBATION OFFICER THIS IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE JUVENILE COURT LAW TO PROVIDE FOR THE PROTECTION AND SAFETY OF THE PUBLIC AND EACH YOU UNDER ITS JURISDICTION I REFER OF COURSE TO WELFARE INCIDENTS INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION TWO OH TWO WHICH IS THE PURPOSE CLAUSE. OF THE JUVENILE LAW. SO IF I MAY IF I MAY JUST FOLLOW UP WITH A SENATOR AND SHEER FUND QUESTIONS BUT IT CERTAINLY WILL BE PART OF MY DIRECTION AS WE GO FORWARD- TO- TO HELP- CONTINUE DIALOGUE IN THIS AREA TO MAKE SURE IT'S CRYSTAL CLEAR BEFORE- HE WOULD HAVE TO VOTE ON THE BILL AGAIN. PERFECT THANK YOU. FIND. IN ORDER TO A BURGER FINAL YES THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. KERN TINA AND WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WARNER WE HAVE A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION TO APPROPRIATIONS. ON S. B. THREE EIGHT THREE CONSULTANT WILL YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. SB THREE EIGHT THREE DO PASTOR PREPARATIONS BRADFORD BRADFORD I IN TROUBLE. JOBO GUY COMMAGER I AM LONGER AYE SKINNER SKINNER I WIENER WIENER AYE THE BILL HAS FIVE VOTES LATER THE MAJOR APPS FIVE VOTES IT IS OUR COMMITTEE CONGRADULATIONS THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN CENTER SECRETION THANK YOU. NEXT UP SHE SHE'S READY TO GO SENATOR ALSO WITH SB. SEVEN THREE ONE. IT GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I WILL BE PRESENTING SB SEVEN THREE ONE AND I WANT TO START BY TAKING AN AN AMENDMENT TO CLARIFY THAT COURTS DA'S AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS HAVE ACCESS TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S COMPLETE CONVICTION RECORDS- JUST TO MAKE THAT. EVEN MORE CLEAR. FROM WHAT DOES SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE DO IT CREATES AN AUTOMATIC PROCESS TO PHASE OUT RECORDS OF CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS OVERTIME IN TWO PHASES STEP ONE THE PARTIAL CEILING ONCE SOMEONE HAS COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCE INCLUDING THEIR INITIAL POST RELEASE SUPERVISION REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT ANY ARRESTS OR CONVICTIONS THEIR CRIMINAL RECORD BECOMES PARTIALLY SEALED. FOR BASIC EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING PURPOSES STEP TWO IS A FULL FEELING IT AFTER A PARTIAL CEILING THE PERSON THEN MAINTAINS A FURTHER PERIOD OF TWO YEARS. BEYOND THE END OF SENTENCE IN SUPER VISIT SUPERVISION DURING WHICH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF A NEW CRIME THEY WOULD RECEIVE FULL CEILING OF THEIR CONVICTION RECORD. I AM JOINED BY A DIVERSE COALITION OF ECONOMIC JUSTICE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BUSINESS AND COMMERCIAL GROUPS AND RELIGIOUS ORGANIZATIONS ALL OF WHICH ARE HERE TO CALL FOR AN END TO THE SYSTEM SYSTEMIC. DISENFRANCHISEMENT AN EXCLUSION THAT AFFECTS AS MANY AS EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND MANY MANY MORE ACROSS THE COUNTRY TODAY- THE LOS ANGELES CHAMBER OF COMMERCE ADDED THEIR SUPPORT. SB SEVEN THREE ONE WILL CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE PROCESS TO SEAL CONVICTION AND ARREST RECORDS- AS I SAID THERE ARE. EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. LIVING WITH AN ARRESTER CONVICTION ON THEIR RECORD THEY ARE OUR SIBLINGS OUR PARENTS THEIR NEIGHBORS CO WORKERS FELLOW CHURCH GOERS WHEN IT INDIVIDUAL COMPLETES OUR SENSE THEY HAVE PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY AND ACCEPTED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR ACTIONS. WHILE THEY ARE INCARCERATED MANY OF THEM TOOK CLASSES ARE ENROLLED IN COUNSELING THEY PURSUED THEIR REHABILITATION AND WORKED HARD TO BE PREPARED FOR REENTRY INTO OUR COMMUNITY AFTER THE RELEASE INSTEAD OF BEING ABLE TO PUT THEIR NEW SKILLS TO USE THE ARE HIT WITH LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF RESTRICTIONS AND LIMITATIONS. THAT KEEP THEM FROM BUILDING A NEW LIFE CALIFORNIA MAINTAINS AN INDIVIDUAL'S CONVICTION RECORDS UNTIL THEY REACH A HUNDRED YEARS OF AGE. A PAST RECORD DENIES A NEW FAMILY FROM MOVING INTO A NEW HOUSE. DENIES MOTHERS THE CHANCE TO PURSUE A CAREER IN EDUCATION AND DENIES FATHERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO COACH THEIR CHILDREN. SOMEONE WITH THE PAST RECORD CAN BE BLOCKED FROM RECEIVING FINANCIAL AID OR ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES. A PARENT CAN BE DENIED THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADOPT A FAMILY MEMBER OR PREVENTED FROM JOINING THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION. NEARLY 75% OF FORMERLY INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ARE STILL EMPLOYED UNEMPLOYED A YEAR AFTER RELEASE. OUR STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS INTO REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS YET ALL WE DO IS DRIVE THOSE PEOPLE TO THE MARGINS OF SOCIETY. RATHER THAN PROTECTING PUBLIC SAFETY BLANKET RESTRICTIONS AND BARRIERS CONTRIBUTE TO THE CYCLE OF CRIME. OUR COALITION REPORTS ARE AS MANY AS THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS THAT HAVE BEEN DENIED EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF PAST RECORDS IN THIS LAST YEAR ALONE. CALIFORNIA SHOULD PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS THE TOOLS TO TURN THE PAGE ON THEIR PAST GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD A NEW AND BETTER LIFE- SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TODAY WILL BE FATHER GREG BOYLE AND HOMEBOY INDUSTRIES AND AT LITTLE. FROM CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE. JOHN CUTLER FROM CALIFORNIANS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE WILL BE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I URGE AND AIBEL. THANK YOU. MR LOW READY OR ARE WE GONNA START WOULD FATHER BOYLE. OUR PRIMARY WITNESSES MR LOW OR FATHER BOYLE. MODERATOR YOU ONE OF THOSE ON. OKAY. HELLO- NO NO. I DO NOT SEE EITHER WITNESSES BEING CONNECTED.

THE WITH I'M SORRY MISTER CHAIR FOR CAN- I'VE BEEN TOLD THE WITNESSES SAY THEY ARE ON HOLD. MR BY THEY WERE ON HOLD. SENATOR SKINNER HI I KNOW THIS IS NOT OUR- ACTICIN ORDER BUT WHILE THIS IS BEING SORTED MAY I SPEAK TO THE- OFFICE THAT OUT FOR A LITTLE BIT CENTER YOU MAY SPEAK TO THE BILL. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE FOR THOSE WERE LISTENING THAT USUALLY WE WOULD TAKE TESTIMONY BEFORE SOMEONE SPEAKS TO A BILL THAT I HAVE T STEP OUT FOR ABOUT A HALF AN HOUR FROM COMMITTEE. AND IN RETURN SO I WANTED TO EXPRESS. I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING US THE BILL AND HER DESCRIPTION OF THE CUMBERSOME. NATURE A COMMERCIAL I'M EVEN IF IT'S JUST NOT EVEN APPROPRIATE WORK. RATHER THE STIGMA. THAT IS PUT ON A PERSON. ONCE THEY HAVE A RECORD. NOW CLEARLY. IF A PERSON HAS COMMITTED A CRIME. AND YOU KNOW WE'VE CONVICTED AND- GIVEN WHATEVER APPROPRIATE- SENTENCE OR PROBATION OR WHAT HAVE YOU. AND THEY HAVE BEEN BEEN CRIME FREE. THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE STICKY. THEY'VE ALREADY KAY AND THEIR FAMILIES ALREADY HAVE HAD GREAT FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES TO THEIR- TO JUST THE WHOLE PROCESS OF. YOU KNOW HAVING TO DEAL WITH THE CONVICTION AND- IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO COURT AND THEN OF COURSE ANY TIME IN JAIL OR PRISON. SO THERE'S ALREADY GREAT GREAT ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES TODAY AND THEIR FAMILIES. SO ONCE THEY ARE CRIME FREE WE HAVE TO REMOVE EVERY OBSTACLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO FUNCTION. AND THAT RECORD. IS A BARRIER JUSTICE THE AUTHOR SAID IN ALMOST EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE. IT IS LIKE YOU ARE. ARE MARKED FOR LIFE. AND NEVER REALLY ALLOWED TO FULLY FUNCTION. AND I JUST THINK THAT IT IS. NOT SOMETHING THAT WE- I WANT TO DO. AN WHEN WE ARE THINK ABOUT. THAT IT IS DISPROPORTIONATE WHO IS. STOP ARRESTED CHARGED AND CONVICTED FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T HAVE ANY MEMBER OF MY FAMILY WHO ARE SERVE TIME BUT I CAN TELL YOU MANY MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY HAVE COMMITTED CRIMES. AND THEY WERE LET OFF FOR ANY NUMBER OF THINGS. AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE THAT STIGMA. SO I JUST FEEL WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ONCE A PERSON HAS IS CRIME FREE TO GIVE THEM EVERY OPPORTUNITY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT THE AUTHORS GOING. ON AND I WILL VOTE FOR THE BILL I WOULD EVEN MOVE IT BUT I THINK IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT TO HEAR FROM WITNESSES AND SUCH BUT PERHAPS WE'RE IN THAT MODE AND APOLOGIES THAT I HAVE TO STEP OUT.

THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OPPOSITION AROSE ARE THERE ARE PRIMARY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION OF. THREE SEVEN THREE ONE I SEE WE HAVE A FRIEND C. KOEHLER AND WE HAVE LARRY MARSH ARMS MODERATOR OR EITHER OR BOTH OF THOSE. APPEAR TO TESTIFY AT THIS MOMENT. WE HAVE A LAYER OF EARTH. YEAH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU SIR- NUMBER READY CORY MORSE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE A PORTION OF THIS BILL WHAT ARCHIVE FELONY CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS SO THAT THEY WOULD NOT APPEAR ON STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HISTORY INFORMATION. AS WE RATE THIS BILL A PERSON CONVICTED OF EMBEZZLING HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS FROM MULTIPLE ELDERLY VICTIMS AND SENT TO PRISON FOR THOSE CRIMES WOULD IF THE RELIEF OFFERED IN THIS BILL WERE GRANTED THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR A JOB AS A BOOKKEEPER OR CFO FOR A LONG TER BOARDING CARE FACILITY WITHOUT THE OWNER'S OF THE FACILITY OR THE RESIDENTS OR THEIR FAMILIES HAVING ANY IDEA. OF HIS OR HER CRIMINAL PAST. WHAT BURKE. DOES THIS. OFFERED TO UNWARY BUSINESS OWNER WHO HIRES A PERSON WITH A HISTORY OF FINANCIAL CRIMES. THAT BUSINESS OWNER HAVE NO RIGHT TO PROTECT HERSELF FOR CUSTOMERS. SIMILARLY A PERSON COULD HAVE BEEN CONVICTED OF A FELONY FOR CORPORAL ABUSE OF A CHILD AND THEN PETITION FOR THE RELIEF OFFERED IN THIS BILL. FIRST REMAINS TO. PREPRINT TWO YEARS AFTER THE RELIEF WAS GRANTED HERE SHE COULD THEN APPLY FOR A JOB AT A DAYCARE FACILITY. WITHOUT EITHER THE OWNER OR OTHER PARENTS BEING AWARE. OF HIS OR HER CRIMINAL BACKGROUND. WE DO RECOGNIZE THE SERIOUS EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING IMPEDIMENTS THAT CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS COMPOSED FOR A PERSON WITH A FELONY CONVICTION. AND OF OFFERED REPEATEDLY TO WORK WITH ADVOCATES TO ENSURE THAT ANY CALLS. US TO THE RESTRICTIONS. CARE SOME TANGENTIAL RELATIONSHIP TO THE CRIME. OR CRIMES COMMITTED AND ARE NEITHER ARBITRARY NOR UNDULY PUNITIVE. AS IS SO OFTEN THE CASE CDA IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE FUNDAMENTAL OBJECTIVE UNDERLYING THIS BILL. BUT THE SWEEP OF THIS PROPOSAL DOES NOT PROVIDE ADEQUATE SAFEGUARDS FOR BUSINESS OWNERS AND FAMILIES OR OTHERS. WHO HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT THE PEOPLE THEY HIRE. ESPECIALLY THOSE IN POSITIONS OF TRUST WITH READY ACCESS TO VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AS WE READ THE BILL ANY FELONY ARRESTS WERE RELIEF WAS GRANTED UNDER SECTION EIGHT FIFTY ONE. NINE THREE WOULD BE ARCHIVED IF THE DEFENDANT HAD NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF A NEW OFFENSE WITHIN TWO YEARS OF RELIEF BEING GRANTED. BACK TO BE PROBLEMATIC FOR SEVERAL REASONS. FOR EXAMPLE IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR FELONY CASES TO TAKE TWO OR MORE YEARS TO RESOLVE. THESITUATION VERY LIKELY EXACERBATED IN THE AFTERMATH OF COLORED NINETEEN. AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS GRANTED RELIEF UNDER EIGHT FIFTY ONE POINT NINE THREE OR ANY OF THE OTHER IN HUMAN THERE THE NEW OPERATED WILL LEAVE SECTIONS. COULD HAVE A FELONY CASE PENDING DURING THE TWO YEAR PERIOD SINCE RELIEF WAS GRANTED. CONSEQUENTLY AS A MATTER OF LOS ANGELES- INDIVIDUAL WOULD HAVE THEIR PRIOR FELONY CONVICTION ARCHIVES. BECAUSE THEY HAD NOT BEEN CONVICTED UNTIL AFTER THE TWO YEAR PERIOD EXPIRED. AS THE STABENOW'S IS NOTED THERE ARE STATE LICENSING AREAS BEYOND THOSE ADDRESSED IN THE BILL THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC IF THIS BILL WERE TO PASS. THE MEASURE IS JUST FAR TOO BROAD WE ARE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR. IN CHARGERS DRAFT SOMETHING MORE NARROWLY. AND MORE PRO PUBLIC SAFETY. AS WRITTEN WE GREAT. ABOUT THE AND RISK. I FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE MOVED TO MISS KOEHLER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS FRANTIC COLOR AND I AM A TWO TERM PAST PRESIDENT AND THE CURRENT GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS CHAIR OF CALLIE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LICENSE INVESTIGATORS CERTAINLY KELLY SUPPORT A PROCESS TO GIVE PEOPLE A SECOND CHANCE PARTICULARLY WHEN IT INVOLVES EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. BUT WE'RE CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE IT'S NOT STRIKE AN APPROPRIATE BALANCE BETWEEN THE ABILITY OF CONVICTED INDIVIDUALS TO BUILD A NEW LIFE AND THE PROTECTION OF THE PUBLIC. HAS WRITTEN- THE MEASURE WOULD PLACE LEGAL- MEASURES ADDED AND VERY DISADVANTAGED. I UNDERSTAND STAND THEN THE RISE OF SAYS HER BILL BEEN AMENDED AND DEFENSE ATTORNEYS WOULD HAVE ACCESS. SO I HAVE A QUESTION FOR SENATOR ALSO AT THE END OF MY TESTIMONY AND BAD IS GOOD A CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY HAVE ACCESS TO ANYONE. FROM ALL THE STREET. OR IS IT JUST THEIR CLIENT- BECAUSE THEY ARE MANY TIME THAT COULD HOLD ATTORNEY WILL LOOK AT CRIMINAL RECORDS REGARDING YOUR OWN WITNESSES THAT THE PROSECUTION OR LAW ENFORCEMENT UP TO KNOW ABOUT AND MAYBE MAY OR MAY NOT AND- I DECIDE TO CALL THEM. SO IT RAISES ISSUES WHICH SEEMS AT THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE WHAT HAVE. SPECIAL EXPERTISE AND ABSENT A REFERRAL TO THAT COMMITTEE I WOULD URGE ARE WE WOULD URGE SAID- THERE COUNCIL COULD BE CONSULTED. ACCOUNT ALSO CONCERNED THAT SB SEVEN THIRTY ONE IS SO BROAD THAT IT'S QUITE FORESEEABLE THAT PROVISION COULD ENDANGER PUBLIC SAFETY. NUMEROUS SITUATIONS EXCEPT FOR INFORMATION INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED OF A CRIME CAN BE A VIOLENT. COURT COURT USED TO THE- I PROTECT THEM. OF ALL OF THAT. SOME OF THESE. WHERE A CONNECTION CURRENT CURRENT NET NEUTRALITY. AND BACKGROUND CHECK LIKE MR MORE STAD- EVALUATED PRINT AND DIVORCE CASE VALUE WITHIN COURT HOLDER AND MARK AT AND BUSINESS PARTNERS. LOOKING BE RELATIVES FOR PROBATE MISTY AIR. THIRTY EVALUATING VIOLENCE AND INVOLVING ORDER AND I IN INDIVIDUAL AND RUN RELATIONS. THE TERM WHETHER COME WOULD BE A RISK WHEN APPLE WITH CONVICTED OF FRAUD AGAIN AS MR MORE SAID THEY APPLY FOR FINANCIAL POSITION. DETERMINING WHETHER EMPLOYEES WOULD BE A RISK WHEN AN APPLICANT HAS BEEN. CONVICTED OF FELONY ASSAULT. INDETERMINATES FINALLY WHEN COMMUNITY WOULD BE AT RISK TWENTY BILLION EMPIRE DEPARTMENT EMPLOYMENT APPLICANT. SO FOR THESE REASONS AND ACTUALLY MANY OTHERS KELLY A COUPLE OF THOSE SB THIRTY SEVEN THIRTY ONE AND I WE ARE BACK TO SENATOR PER DEVICE SO REGARDING THE QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO ALL CRIMINAL RECORDS. AS THE PROSECUTION AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. THANK YOU THINK. THANK YOU. NOW LET'S MOVE TO OUR WITNESSES IN THE ROOMS ARE THERE WITNESSES HERE FORTY TWO OR THREE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY HI IN OPPOSITION I SEE NINE HERE TWENTY FORTY I SEE ONE THERE ARE NO ONE THERE EITHER EITHER NOW MR MODERATOR. LET'S MOVE TO THE PHONE ONLINE. THANK YOU MAKE AMERICAN ENERGY. AND THE SEVEN THREE ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO RECOMMEND AGAIN ONE.

WIENER THE QUESTIONS WE HAVE SENATOR CHOI BOGUE WITH A QUESTION. HELLO THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR JUST A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS- I CAN A CURIOUS- BEFORE YOU MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONES BUT I HAD NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THE CONCERN THAT THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER JUST HAD WITH REGARDS TO THE MULTIPLE OFFENSES- IN TAKING THAT INTO CONSIDERATION AND- IN IN GETTING RD OF EVERYBODY'S PASSED- AS SOMEONE WHO PERSONALLY KNOWS- PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN IMPRISONED AND HAVE- YOU KNOW. COME BACK AND DONE REALLY WELL- WITH THEIR LIFE INCLUDING A PASTOR BRIAN WHO'S CURRENTLY A CITY COUNCIL IN IN SCIENCE CENTER. I AM AND SOMEONE WHO HAS ALSO VISITED A WOMEN'S SHELTER WHO- WHOSE FOCUS IN MY IN MY DISTRICT IS TO YOU WE REUNITE WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY INCARCERATED WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND GIVING THEM THAT OPPORTUNITY THIS GUILT AND EVERYTHING TO MOVE FORWARD ON THERE. I VERY MUCH RESPECT THE INTENT OF THE BILL SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORTH. BUT I DO HAVE A CONCERN WITH REGARDS TO- THE ABILITY TO HAVE AN ASSESSMENT- TO CONSIDER WHETHER OR THE OFFENSE IS RELEVANT TO THE JOB. OFFENSE TOP TIME THAT HAS PASSED WHEN IT COMES TO- EMPLOYMENT- IN IN IN THAT SECOND CHANCE. IS THERE ANY POSSIBLE WAY THAT YOU COULD. PERHAPS WORK THAT INTO THIS BILL OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY CONSIDER I SHOULD PROBABLY ASK FIRST IF IT'S SOMETHINGTHAT YOU MAY CONSIDER. THESE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE- WHAT THE PAST OFFENSES ARE- AND IN SAFETY MOVING FORWARD-AND I'M TRYING TO THINK OF AN EXAMPLE PERHAPS- AS SOMEONE WHO HAD. MOLESTED CHILDREN FOR INSTANCE AND TO THE REALITY TO YOU KNOW APPLY FOR A JOB WITH ANYTHING THAT RELATES TO CHILDREN WOULD BE SOMETHING OF A CONCERN FOR ME- OR- THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT'S COMING UP THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT- THOSE TYPE OF SCENARIOS ARE WHAT CONCERNS ME THAT WE DON'T ADDRESS- I DON'T SEE. ANY SEE IT ANYWAY- BEING ADDRESSED IN THE BILL AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT YOU MAY CONSIDER WORKING IN WITH WITHIN THE SPELL. WELL MAYBE I COULD START WITH THE- HI MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU GRANT- SENATOR- WITH REGARDS TO THE VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION AS FAR AS THE SIX- CRIMES. ANYONE CURRENTLY ON THE SEX OFFENDER REGISTRY IS INELIGIBLE FOR RELIEF SO JUST USING THAT AS AN EXAMPLE ARE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE A NEW FELONY CONVICTION IF YOU'RE SERVING TIME FOR CURRENT OFFENSE IF YOU'RE SERVING TIME ON PROBATION OR PAROLE P. OF A PENDING CHARGE. YOUR INELIGIBLE SO- OUR OUR WHOLE. GOAL HERE. IS TO GIVE TO BE ABLE TO SHOW AFTER THEY'VE- SERVED THEIR SENTENCE AFTER THEY'VE- COMPLETED WHAT- SINCE THEY BEEN GIVEN FOR THEIR PARTICULAR CRIME THAT THEY DEVELOP THAT OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO SAY. MY RECORD DOESN'T DEFINE WHO I AM AS A HUMAN BEING WHO I AM AS A PERSON. AND SO WE REALLY WANT THAT TO AT SOME POINT HAS TO MAKE A CUT. FROM THE PAST AND ALLOW THAT INDIVIDUAL TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD AND THAT'S THE WHOLE GOAL HERE WE UNDERSTAND THERE'S SOME CIRCUMSTANCES AS WE JUST LISTED. WHICH WOULD BE YOU KNOW L. MAKE THE PERSON INELIGIBLE BUT THE WHOLE POINT IS NOT TO ALLOW THAT PASSED RECORD TO KEEP. HUNTING THAT MIGHT KEEP COMING UP AND KEEP UP PUSHING THEM AND IN THE OUT YOU KNOW OUTSKIRTS OF OUR OF OUR COMMUNITY- SO I. WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO KEEP PEOPLE- TO KEEP PEOPLE FROM MOVING FORWARD WE'RE LOOKING FOR A WAY FOR THEM TO GET OUT SHED THAT AND MOVE FORWARD SO I DON'T- I DON'T SEE WHY. I DON'T SEE MYSELF RIGHT NOW MOVING IN THE DIRECTION THAT YOU JUST SAID ABOUT EXCLUDING PEOPLE WITH MULTIPLE. THREE MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE YOU KNOW SOMETHING ON THEIR ON THEIR RECORD THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. AND I IN A OFFICE SYMPATHIZE WITH THAT I DO ALSO. AS SENATOR FROM ORDER POINTED OUT EARLIER IN A IN A PREVIOUS BILL DO YOU BELIEVE IN IN IN THE IN IN IN PEOPLE AND IN THE GOOD WELL. I KNOW THERE'S THERE WILL ALWAYS BE PEOPLE THAT ARE NEFARIOUS AND WON'T BE ABLE TO LOOK PAST THAT BUT AS SOMEONE WHO. PERSONALLY HAD A FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAS EMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO HAVE SERVED TIME BECAUSE HE BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE DESERVES A SECOND CHANCE. I AM CONCERNED THOUGH THAT. PEOPLE WITH THE IN CERTAIN. CRIME CATEGORIES- APPLY TO CERTAIN JOBS THAT KIND OF REFLECTOR UNDER ARE ARE WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR. THAT COVER FOR- GIVE ME ONE SECOND LET ME SEE IF I CAN ARTICULATE THIS A LITTLE BETTER. WHOSE CRIME. HIS CRIME- AFFECTED OR REFLECTED EIGHT JOB THAT THEY'RE PURSUING- SO AND ACCOUNT FOR INSTANCE AND- IN THIS IS PROBABLY A TERRIBLE EXAMPLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT IS THEIR LIVELIHOOD THAT IS OUR SKILL SET BUT IF THEY ACTED IN IT AND NOTHING UNETHICAL WAY WHERE THEY HAVE TO SERVE TIME AND THEY WERE TRYING TO RE APPLY I GUESS YOU COULD ALWAYS GO. INDEPENDENT ON THAT END BUT- IF I CAN MAKE THAT JUST AS AN EXAMPLE AS IS THAT BEING- KIND OF A- YOU KNOW AS AN EMPLOYER I WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW NOT FOR ME PERSONALLY BUT FOR SOME MIGHT HAVE HESITANCY AND HIRING SOMEONE IT OF THAT OF THAT BACKGROUND- IS THERE ANY SAFETY GUARDS OR ANY- I GUESS SAFETY GUARDS ARE SURE IS THAT WE COULD GIVE THE PUBLIC. TO BE MORE ACCEPTABLE OF. HIRING SOMEONE THAT HAS HAD PRIOR CONVICTIONS IN IN THEIR FIELD. WELL AGAIN THE WHOLE POINT IS TO HELP PEOPLE SHED THAT RECORD FROM THERE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE A RECORD. COULD ALSO COMMIT THAT CRIME. SO IT OUR POINT IS HERE IS THAT LET'S TREAT THEM. SINCE THEY MET THEIR A GOOD CUPPA COMPLETED THEIR SENTENCE THEY'VE GONE TWO YEARS WITHOUT COMMITTING ANOTHER CRIME THAT LET THEM NOW MOVES FORWARD INSTEAD OF HOLDING THEM BACK- SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAS NOT COMMITTED A CRIME IS JUST AS ABLE TO COMMIT A CRIME LIKE A BEZEL MEANT AS AND S. WE WANT TO YOU'D TREAT PEOPLE. AS EQUALS WHEN THEY COME FORWARD AND SAY I'VE DEALT WITH MY PAST I WANT TO MOVE FORWARD. GIVE ME A JOB. I'M GONNA WORK HARD FOR IT I TOOK CLASSES I'M PREPARED. ALL THAT IS IN PLACE SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. DO YOU THINK THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO. ACKNOWLEDGE AND VALIDATE THEIR PAST AS WELL AS WHEN YOU'RE HIRING HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT THE REASON I'M ASKING IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I'M AT STATING MAKING THAT STATEMENT IS. PEOPLE LIKE MY FAMILY MEMBER WHO HAS HIRED AT PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN OUT WHO HAVE SERVED TIME I'M THINKING OF A PASTOR BRIAN FROM SCIENCE CENTER WHO HAS SERVED TIME IN OPENLY DISCUSSES- YOU KNOW IT'S VERY TRANSPARENT IN IN IN WHAT HE HAS DONE AND YET HAS BEEN ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD. DO YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT IS CURRENTLY- CURRENTLY A REASON TO GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE TRANSPARENT AND ONLY AND IT AND- IT AND VALIDATE I THINK OUR LIFE EXPERIENCES MAKE US WHO WE ARE AND GIVES THAT THAT CHARACTER- DO YOU THINK THAT THAT. BUT PEOPLE DON'T DESERVE TO BE TRANSPARENT AND OWNING AB ONE ON ONE SIDE WHAT THEY'VE DONE IN THE PAST NUMBER TWO HAVING THE ABILITY TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE YOU'VE DONE THIS BUT I SEE THAT YOU'VE DONE ALL OF THIS EXTRA WORK TO BETTER YOURSELF AND MOVE FORWARD IN YOUR LIFE SO MANY GIVE ME THAT SHOT. I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT. FAR MORE PEOPLE HAVE USE IT AGAINST THEM THEN THEY HAVE. USED IT AS A WAY OF HELPING THAT PERSON MOVE FORWARD. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO MUCH DISCRIMINATION AGAINST INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR RECORD. BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA. BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT GOES ALONG WITH IT WE DEHUMANIZE- FOREVER THEY HAVE THIS THIS LABEL ON THEM. SO WHAT WE WANNA DO IS. ALLOW THEM TO MOVE FORWARD THAT'S THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU CENTER DATACENTER. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS THE COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I WOULD LOVE TO BE ADDED ON AS A CO AUTHOR. I'M I. I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I THINK ARM. I OFTENTIMES A CHALLENGE WITH A LOT OF THE BILLS THAT ARE BROUGHT BEFORE US IS THAT. WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO- ACT IN HINDSIGHT OFTENTIMES WE ARE ASKING PEOPLE TO BE PERFECT- AND WE ARE HOLDING FOLKS WHO HAVE CRIMINAL RECORDS OR WHO HAVE MADE BAD DECISIONS TO A HIGHER STANDARD- IN OFTENTIMES WE'RE HAVING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. HAVE BEEN CAUGHT- AND WE LEAVE NO SPACE FOR THE FOLKS THE MILLIONS OF FOLKS WERE OUT THERE YOU KNOW COMMITTING CRIMES ARE DOING BAD THINGS THAT JUST HAPPENED TO NOT GET CAUGHT- AND AT THE END OF THE DAY THEY PROBABLY ALL DESERVE TO BE IN THE SAME MARKET. YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE WORKING TO. GIVE PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL HOW ARE WE GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE AND HOW ARE WE GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO NOT BE DEFINED. BY PAST EXPERIENCES OR CIRCUMSTANCES I AM SURE THAT SO MANY OF US IF WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO BACK IN TIME. WE WOULD HAVE MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION ABOUT A PARTNER ABOUT A JOB. ABOUT SOMETHING WE SAID ABOUT HOW WE TREATED SOMEONE. AND BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY AFFORDED THAT- BUT WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AS IT RELATES TO EMPLOYMENT. AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AND WHEN WE CONTINUE TO SHUT THOSE DOORS. WE ACTUALLY FINAL PEOPLE BACK INTO A RE AND CARCERAL- PIPELINE. AND WE CREATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO. ON RAVEL HERE ON THIS VERY COMMITTEE- AND I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO HAVE DEEPER DISCUSSIONS WITH OURSELVES ABOUT HOW MUCH WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE- AND THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN GROSS INTRUSIVENESS. AND REALLY FINDING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE IN ORDER TO EMPLOY THEM. AND WHEN TOO MUCH IS JUST TOO MUCH- I THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY A TON OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO REALLY GOOD C. P. A.'S OR ACCOUNTANTS OR SOCIAL WORKERS. WHO MIGHT HAVE DONE SOMETHING BAD EVEN IN THAT SAME. YOU KNOW FIELD OF WORK. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE A BAD PERSON IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY DESERVE THEY SHOULDN'T GET A SECOND CHANCE- AND IF THEY ARE REALLY EGREGIOUS AND CHANCES ARE THEY WILL DO SOMETHING BAD AGAIN- AND THEY WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT SO. I REALLY APPLAUD YOU FOR ASKING US TO BE BETTER NEIGHBORS TO OUR NEIGHBORS- IN MEETING PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND GIVING THEM A SECOND CHANCE SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I TO SENATOR WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR THIS- MEASURE HERE IT'S A COMMON SENSE MEASURE ON ONE I SIMPLY. IF WHO HAS. DAUNTED CRIME PAID THEIR DUES TO SOCIETY SHOULDN'T BE BRANDED WITH A SCARLET LETTER THE REST YOUR LIFE HOW THEY SHOULD BE- AFFORDED THE OPPORTUNITY. TO MOVE FORWARD GAIN HOUSING- GAIN EDUCATION AND MANY TIMES THOSE. RIVAS CONVICTIONS OF PREVENT THAT AND SO I COMMEND YOU FOR THIS I DID EXPUNGEMENT RECORD A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY- BUT THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS WITH THE INTERNET AND ALL THAT WE KNOW NOTHING'S EVER. EVER GONE REAL SO THE LIKELIHOOD OF ONE'S PAST COMING BACK TO HAUNT HIM WILL HAPPEN IF ONE TRULY WANTS TO LOOK FAR ENOUGH THIS JUST PUTS A FIREWALL. AND ALLOW THAT INDIVIDUAL TO MOVE FOR WITH THEIR LIFE- NO LONGER HAVING NECESSARY TO CHECK THE BOX THE AGAIN THEY STILL HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE BEING CONVICTED BUT THE RECORD IS SEALED TO THE POINT OF. NOT HAVING GREAT ACCESS BUT AS WE ALL KNOW THROUGH THE INTERNET NOTHING HAS EVER GONE AWAY AS WE'VE SEEN IN SO MANY WAYS OF. COMING BACK WHO HAVE NOT COMMITTED CRIMINAL OFFENSES TO HAVE THEIR PAST BROUGHT UP BY SOMETHING THAT HE DID. YOU KNOW- VIA THE INTERNET- FIFTEEN YEARS AGO SO ON THAT NOTE- WE HAVE A MOTION HOW WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE I'M SORRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUST ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WE HAVE A MOTION WE HAVE EVERY TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR COM LONGER.

I THINK WE'VE GONE TO GREAT POINT ON THIS ISSUE. ESPECIALLY WITH THE NEW AMENDMENTS TO THEBILL THAT I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT AND PROMOTE. SO SENATE SENATE BILL THREE FIFTY EIGHT WITH THE CAME A MINUTE WITH THE COMMITTEE ADMIN METS MODERNIZES THE DEFINITION OF MAIL. AND PROTECTS ALL FORMS OF MAIL THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE DELIVERY PROCESS. CURRENTLY THE DEFINITION MALE ONLY PROTECTS USPS MAIL. THIS DEFINITION SIMPLY OUTDATED. TODAY WE HAVE MANY MAIL CARRIER OPTIONS AND MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF MALE RANGING FROM POSTCARDS TO LARGE ENVELOPES AND PACKAGES. ALL THE SHOULD BE AWARDED THE SAME THEFT PROTECTION AS U. S. P. S. UNITED STATES POSTAL SERVICE MAIL. BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT CARVE IT NINETEEN SITUATION ONLINE SALES HAVE INCREASED EXPONENTIALLY. IN FACT BETWEEN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR ONLINE SALES INCREASED FORTY NINE PERCENT. IN THE COUNTRY. WHILE SHOPPING ONLINE CAN BE EASIER AND SAFER UNFORTUNATELY THESE WITH MALAN TENSIONS ARE INCREASINGLY STEALING PACKAGES. THESE THIEVES ARE OFTEN REFERRED TO AS PORCH PIRATES. A DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNT OF PORCH PIRACY OCCURS IN CALIFORNIA IN 20001930% OF ALL STOLEN PACKAGES ACROSS THE NATION WERE STOLEN IN THIS STATE. THESE PACKAGES CONTAIN A WIDE VARIETY OF ESSENTIAL ITEMS SUCH AS MEDICATIONS AND FOOD. TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AND DISABLED INDIVIDUALS RELY ON PACKAGE DELIVERY FOR SURVIVAL IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE WE MUST TAKE EVERY STEP TO STOP PORCH PIRACY. THIS UPDATED DEFINITION OF MAIL WILL HELP COMBAT PORCH PIRACY BY PROTECTING ALL TYPES OF MAIL INCLUDING PACKAGES FROM ALL TYPES OF MAIL CARRIERS- MADAM CHAIR I BELIEVE.

THE PRIVATE SECTOR DELIVERY SUSPECT CORRECT THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING- I'M OF COURSE ALWAYS HESITANT TO. EITHER EXPAND STATUTES OR ADD BUBBLERS AND SUCH BUT IF THERE. IS IN FACT THE. IT IS TRUE THAT WHENEVER WE DID I IMAGINE WHENEVER WE DID THE INITIAL STATUTES THERE MAY NOT HAVE BEEN. AS MUCH AS PRIVATE SECTOR TYPE DELIVERY SUCH AS AMAZON FEDEX AND SUCH- BUT I WOULD APPRECIATE I SUPPOSE KNOWING EITHER FROM THE TERROR FROM THE FROM THE BEAUTY CONSULTANT JUST THE- WHETHER THIS IS DUPLICATIVE OF CURRENT LAW. OR WHETHER WE ARE ADDRESSING- SOMETHING THAT IS- WOULDN'T WE MIGHT CALL AMBIGUOUS IN CURRENT LAW. IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WHAT CURRENTLY IS ON THE BOOKS AS IT RELATES TO US. POSTAL SERVICE- THAT THAT WORKERS ALREADY ON THE BOARD BOOKS ENERGY STATED IT JUST EXPANDS IT TO COVER. THOSE YOU KNOW PRIVATE. DELIVERIES LIKE UPS- FEDEX FEDERAL EXPRESS AMAZON THINGS OF THAT NATURE BECAUSE AGAIN. UNDER YEARS AGO. ALONG WITH OUR TRADITIONAL MALE STARTED THERE WAS NO ADDITIONAL COMPETITION I MIGHT WRITE MISS COMMITTEE AND MY DESCRIPTION OF THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OKAY YES. SO I DON'T SEE IT AS AN EXPANSION OF. A CRIME SO TO SPEAK JUST. WHERE FORGET IS WHAT THE- WHAT THE OF A MALE AND ALLOW YEAH YES. OKAY YOU YOU NEED ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS MATTER. NOW HURRY WALLS I TO HEAD CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO. THIS IN ITS INITIAL FORM BECAUSE I TO AS A CENTER SKINNER STATED R. M. ALWAYS LEERY OF EXPANDING. OR ARE CREATING NEW CRIMES AND THAT'S TRUE SOMETIMES- TARGETED WHO THEY'RE TRYING TO GET AT AND CAN CAST A MUCH WIDER BLANKET IN ARNETT I SHOULD SAY THAN SHOULD. BUT I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE IN LIGHT OF. THE FACT THAT MOST OF THE SERVICES NOW IF DROPPED WHAT THE US POSTAL SERVICE ONLY ONCE DID I MEA. I AM BLOWN AWAY ANY TIME AT OUR HOME THE NUMBER. AMAZON OR FEDEX OR VARIOUS EARS ARE ON THE STREET EVERY DAY DELIVERING WHAT WAS ONCE TRADITIONAL MALE SILVA ARE AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT A LOT OF THESE ARE TARGETING NOW IS THOSE PACKAGES THAT ARE DELIVERED- VIA THE- THAT. SYSTEM OR SERVICE I SHOULD SAY SO- WITH THAT YOU KNOW I'VE WAS WILLING TO. MOVE FOR WITH THIS AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND ARE WILLING TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS THAT CONCERN AND MAKING SURE THAT WE WEREN'T. EXPANDING CRIMES ARE CREATING WOBBLIES WHERE THEY DIDN'T EXIST SO. THAT WAS THE CASE- I'M FINE WITH THE MEASURE- WE'RE SEEKING A MOTION- ON BEHALF OF. SB THREE FIVE EIGHT. SENATOR WIENER ALL OF THE BILL AND I'M I ALSO- I HAD SERIOUS CONCERNS WITHOUT WAS DRAFTED BY- I AGREE WITH THE CHAIR THAT I THINK THIS- CREATES PARITY THAT WOULD NOT.

IT ALSO A LOT OF FOR PEOPLE WHO A PLEA DEAL TO LESS CHARGES. SUCH AS MAN. TO PAY FOR RE. THREE REALLY PUT IN THE HARD TO IMPROVE OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. IN A LOT OF THE HARDWARE WITH FOR THIRTY SEVEN. SINCE FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN COURTS OF REASONS THAT FIVE ONLY TO MURDER AND NOT ATTEMPTED MURDER. THIS CALL ACROSS THE BOARD PEOPLE FROM ACROSS FOR REESE. THIS LED TO AN ABSURD AND SAID WHERE PEOPLE ARE OUT FOR FREE. IF THE VICTIM DOES. BUT OUR IN HOUSE IF TO NOT DIE. FURTHERMORE ALTHOUGH FOURTEEN SEVEN A LOT OF PATHWAY. WHO TOOK PLEADED TO CHARGE SUCH AS- TO PLY FROM. THIS BILL TO NOT A X. INCLUDE THOSE P. FOR RESENTENCING. AS THIS LED TO. WITH LEAST COUPLE PEOPLE. ARE STILL SERVING TECH AND- EVEN THOUGH THEY SHOULD BE A. FOR THESE REASONS I BRING SB SO SEVENTY FIVE WHICH CLEAR EXISTING LAW. TO INCLUDE BONTA MAN. AND ATTEMPTED CONVICT. AS ELVES FOR RELEASE UNDER SB FOURTEENTH SEVEN. THIS PHARMACIST OF IN CAR PEOPLE THAT THE PUBLIC DEEM TO BE NEXT. BY THE TECHNICAL LANGUAGE OF FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AND THE THOUSANDS OF SIMILAR PEOPLE WHO DID NOT FILE PETITIONS YET BECAUSE THE COURT RULINGS. WITH ME TODAY FOR ANY ERA WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. AJ CORRECTIONS WITH THE OFFICE OF THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER. THANK YOU- AND I RESPECTFULLY URGE I THOUGHT. THANK YOU WE'LL START WITH YOUR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES EVER JOINT FONG TIME OF FIVE MINUTES SERVICE. YOUR LEAD ONE THIS. SCRIPT SINCE. AB YOUR FIRST PROGRAMMING OKAY HERE. THANK YOU THIS IS A NEED GOOD EVENING I AM A MEMBER OF THE CAL PUBLIC DEFENDER OF SAID AS WELL AS A LIFETIME PUBLIC DEFENDER- AS- CENTER BACK THERE ARE YOU STATE. YOU WHY PASS SENATOR SKINNER'S. SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SO AND BACK INTO EIGHTEEN. TO REDUCE THE OF P. NEED SO WHEN PRISON TERMS THEY WERE NOT THE ACTUAL KILLER DID NOT SHOW INTENT KILL. UNFORTUNATELY SO TWENTY THE COURTS SISTER INTO. FOR THIRTY SEVEN THE LEAD OUT CALL P. SO THE READ THAT WE NEED AS SEVEN SEVEN FIVE. ISSUE AS SENATOR BACKROOM. INCLUDE PEOPLE. HAD LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES LIKE VOLUNTARY. AND LIKE WE PEOPLE AT THE TIME MURDER TWO IN THOSE. WHO SERVING LENGTHY. THAT THEY IN HERE. OR PRIOR YOUR SOME ELSE. AND THEY COULD BE DOING DECADE. YOU THOUGH THEY WERE DE LAST CULPABLE BY THE TO. WHO SAID THEIR CASE. SO IF THIS. SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL COME WITH STRONG LAYING. THAT A PERSON HAS A RIGHT A FULL OF THE PETITION. BUT THEY HAVE A TO CAL POINT TO A THEM IN AS A NEW HEARING WITH NO SHORT CUTS ALLOWED THE COURTS. AND I THINK WE WE'RE LOOKING AT IS IF YOU SMALL. WHICH WILL LEAD TO BANNER FOR K. NOT JUST THE HUNDRED CHIU FILE PETITION IN LAW IN THE- TO NEW. A HEARING AND NOT THE DROUGHT BUT DID A- BECAUSE OF THE RANGE FOR SO. BUT ALL THE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE TWENTY HELP CLEAN UP RECORD TO HELP THEM THREE IN. DENTISTRY AND THEIR. FOR SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE ONE ALSO USED ARE NEEDED RACIAL FOR. BECAUSE IN THE PAST THE NATIONAL DEBT NOT PROBABLY CONCEPT. AND FELONY MURDER THEORY. WERE USED FOR. AGAINST BLACK YOU. WHAT NEXT YEAR'S ASIAN ARE. THEY WERE ALSO DISHED. USED AGAINST WHEN. WHO ARE WRAPPED IN THAT AT THEIR LOVED ONE AND PROSECUTE. AND PERHAPS SETTLED BUT WILL HAVE BEEN IN KNOWLEDGE- UNDER THE RULING. SB SEVEN FIVE WILL IN AND OUR FUN FAIRNESS AND CRIMINAL SAYS. HOUSE SO WORLD IMPROVE EQUAL. DEEPER AND SERRATION OF THESE. I AM ABLE TO FILE FOR A PETITION TO BE RESENTENCED MEANWHILE THOSE WHO WERE BOWLED WENT TO TRIAL LAST THEIR TRIALS PEOPLE HAVE NOW BEEN RESENTENCED UNDER FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND BEEN RELEASED. ALL CALIFORNIANS NOT JUST THOSE INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM WILL SEE BENEFITS TO SEVEN SEVEN FIVE. IN SIGNIFICANT BUDGET SAVINGS IS EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER PERSON WHO WAS RELEASED AND THAT'S THE NUMBER. IT'S NOT A CRIMINAL DEFENSE NUMBER THAT'S OF LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE NUMBER EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR TO INCARCERATED PERSON- BUT ALSO THINK ABOUT THE LAST YEAR WHERE. WE'VE HAD NEEDLESS TRAGIC COBIT DEATHS IN CUSTODY RIGHT WE'VE HAD A KOREAN CDC OURS TRACKER. TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY BEST OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN TWENTY TWO STAFF MEMBER DEATHS FOR A TOTAL OF TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX LOST LIVES THIS LAST YEAR DUE TO COPE ED. IN OUR- YEAH COMMITTEE TENSIONS VENDORS. SO ONE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE IS THAT I KNOW CDA THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ASSOCIATION HAS SOME OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL BASED UPON THE CONCERN THAT PEOPLE WILL NOT BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. BOTH FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND SEVEN SEVEN FIVE MAKE SURE THAT% SOMEONE DID ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR UNDERLYING CONTACT JUST NOT THE OVER ARCHING MURDER THAT SOMEONE ELSE COMMITTED- AND SECONDARILY- I KNOW CBA'S PERSPECTIVE IS THESE PEOPLE BUT THE LESSER INCLUDED OFFENSES. AREN'T FACING A LOT OF TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE BASED TERM IS YOU KNOW AT MOST ELEVEN YEARS BUT THAT'S EXPLORING. AND HENCE MINTS THAT CAN ADD TEN YEARS TWENTY YEARS TO THESE INITIAL BASED TERMS SO THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE SERVING A LOT OF TIME FOR THESE LESSER OFFENSES HE DESERVES AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE RESENTENCED THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE MOVING ON TO THE SECOND WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON- THIS IS AJ CORRECTIONS I'M THE DIRECTOR OF NON CAPITAL LITIGATION AT THE OFFICE IN THE STATE PUBLIC DEFENDER- PROPITIOUS STATED PURPOSE OF- SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH TO ENSURE THAT EACH PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED FOR HIS OR HER ACTIONS ACCORDING TO HIS OR HER OWN LEVEL OF THE INDIVIDUAL CULPABILITY. BUT AS US SENATOR BAKER IMAGE HERE AND HAVE ALREADY TOUCHED ON SOME JUDICIAL INTERPRETATIONS HAVE CREATED GAPS IN THE LAW LEADING TO UNFAIR AND IS SENATOR BACKERS SAID SOMETIMES TRULY ABSURD RESULTS. SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE- DEALS WITH THREE OF THOSE. WHARTON GAPS BUT FIRST. ONE THAT HAS BEEN MENTIONED INCIDENTS ARE SOME COURTS ARE EXCLUDING- FROM SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN ANYONE CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER WHICH MEANS THAT A NON SHOOTER WHO CAN BE LIABLE FOR WHO CAN'T BE LIABLE FOR MURDER IF THE VICTIM IS SHOT AND KILLED WILL FACE HARSH PUNISHMENT IF THE SAME VICTIM SURVIVES I HAVE A REAL LIFE EXAMPLE. A PENDING CASE TWO VERY YOUNG WOMEN AND A MAN WENT OUT TO PAINT GRAFFITI WHEN SOMEONE TRIED TO STOP ONE OF THE WOMEN FROM TAGGING A BUILDING THE MAN GOT OUT OF THE CAR WITH A GUN AND SHOT TWO PEOPLE ONE OF THOSE VICTIMS DIED THE OTHER SURVIVED. THE YOUNG WOMEN DIDN'T INTEND FOR EITHER MAN TO BE SHOT OR KILLED AND UNDER THE SENATE BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THEY CAN NO LONGER BE CONVICTED OF THE. MURDER OF THE ONE WHO DIED. BUT THE COURT. IT ADDS TO THE VICTIMS SERVED. THE TWO WOMEN WERE PROPERLY CONVICTED OF ATTEMPTED MURDER AND THEY CAN SPEND WHAT. SB ZERO POINT TWO. CAME TRUE IN THIS CASE MAKING SPEND DECADES IN PRISON AS A RESULT- SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE CLARIFIES WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN OBVIOUS A DEFENDANT SHOULD NOT BE IN A WORSE POSITION BECAUSE THE SHOOTERS VICTIM SURVIVES- SECONDLY. MANY MINOR PARTICIPANTS IN CRIMES THAT WENT BAD WE'RE ALLOWED TO PLEAD GUILTY TO MANSLAUGHTER IN ORDER TO AVOID BEING PROSECUTED FOR MURDERS THEY DIDN'T COMMIT. IF THEY PLAYED GUILTY TO MURDER UNDER FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN EIGHT NOW BE ALLOWED TO FILE A PETITION TO GET THAT CONVICTION SET ASIDE BUT BECAUSE THEY PLAYED TO THE LESSER CRIME OF MANSLAUGHTER THEY CAN'T FILE A PETITION AND THEY ARE PUNISHED FOR THE KILLING. AND AS WAS POINTED OUT THESE ARE OFTEN BELIEVES CUTTING CULPABLE. PEOPLE INVOLVED IN THE CASE. THAT'S ANOTHER INJUSTICE- THE SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL REMEDY. FINALLY- IT'S IN- IN DESIGNING- SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SENATOR SKINNER MADE SURE THAT PETITIONERS ALMOST ALL OF WHOM ARE INDIGENT HAVE LEGAL REPRESENTATION IN THESE CASES THIS FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IS CRUCIAL BECAUSE THERE'S ALWAYS A PROSECUTOR IN COURT OPPOSING THEM AND OFTEN BECAUSE THESE PEOPLE ARE IN PRISON THEY AREN'T EVEN IN COURT- IF THERE'S NOBODY THERE TO SPEAK FOR THEM. SOME COURTS HAVE MIS READ THE STATUTE AND ALL BUT ELIMINATED THE RIGHT TO APPOINTED COUNSEL US SENATE BILL SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL CORRECT THAT SO- WE DO URGE YOU TO PASS IT THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES AND FORTY TWO OLD THREE IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE I SEE NO WITNESSES HERE IN THIS ROOM NOW WILL MOVE OVER TO THE OVERFLOW ROOM OF TWENTY FORTY I SEE NO ONE DESIRING TO SPEAK THERE.

NO WONDER WHAT THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC OFFERED FROM SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THAT WAS THE LAST ONE WE HAD WE CAN. THIS MODERATOR NOW LET'S MOVE TO OPPOSITION WE SHOW ONLY ONE PRIMARY WITNESS IN OPPOSITION OUT TO MR LAWRIE MARSH MISTER MORRIS ARE YOU PREPARED FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. I AM SORT OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS LEARN MORE SOMEBODY UP AT THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE. ONE SENATE BILL FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WAS APPROVED ITS STATED PURPOSE WAS TO REDUCE LENGTHY SENTENCES THAT WERE DISPROPORTIONATE TO THE CULPABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL. THE PUNISHMENT FOR FIRST DEGREE MURDER IN THE DEATHS IMPRISONMENT IN THE STATE PRISON FOR LIFE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE OR IMPRISONMENT IN STATE PRISON FOR A TERM OF TWENTY FIVE YEARS TO LIFE. THUNDERSTRUCK FOR SECOND DEGREE MURDER SUSPECT STATE PRISON TERM OF FIFTEEN YEARS TO LIFE. THE CHANGES IN COMPOSITION SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND COROLLARY DECISIONS FROM THE SUPREME COURT WERE PREMISED ON THE IDEA THAT THE SENTENCES WERE UNDULY HARSH FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DID NOT MANIFEST AN INTENT TO KILL. HOWEVER THE SENTENCES IMPOSED FOR THE CRIMES OF VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER ARE SUBSTANTIALLY SHORTER. THAN THE SENTENCES IMPOSED FOR MURDER. THE VOLUNTARY MAN. IS IMPRISONMENT FOR THREE SIX OR ELEVEN YEARS THE PUNISHMENT FOR ATTEMPTED MURDER IS IMPRISONMENT FOR FIVE SEVEN OR NINE YEARS IF THE JURY FINDS A PREMEDITATION ALLEGATION TO BE TRUE WHICH DEMONSTRATES AN INTENT TO KILL AND FALLS OUTSIDE OF BOTH FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN AND THIS BILL. THEN THE PUNISHMENT IS LIFE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF PAROLE AFTER SEVEN YEARS. L. AS A DRAMATIC DEPARTURE FROM THE IDEA OF DISPROPORTION ALLEN THE-THAT WAS THE BASIS OF SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. NOT ONE STATE OR FEDERAL COURT HAS EVER HELD THAT THE SENTENCES IMPOSED FOR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER ATTEMPTED MURDER OR PREMEDITATED ATTEMPTED MURDER ARE QUOTE NOT COMMENSURATE WITH THE CULPABILITY OF THE INDIVIDUAL AND QUOTE. MOREOVER NOTHING IN THE LEGISLATIVE HISTORY OF SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN INDICATED THAT THE SENTENCES FOR THE CRIMES INVOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER OR ATTEMPTED MURDER OR NOT COMMENSURATE WITH AN INDIVIDUAL'S CULPABILITY FOR THE CRIME. ARE WE SAYING THAT THE EXISTING SENTENCING TRIADS FOR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND ATTEMPTED MURDER ARE TOO HARSH IMBUE THE ACTIONS OF THE DEFENDANT WHAT THEN IS THE PROPER PUNISHMENT FOR PEOPLE GOING TEND TO KILL. ANY ENHANCEMENTS OR PERSONAL IN THAT THEY CANNOT BE ADDED ON EITHERA FELONY MURDER RULE THEORY OR A NATURAL ONE PROBLEM CONSEQUENCES THERE. IN ADDITION TO THE SUBSTANTIVE OBJECTIONS TO THIS BILL THERE ARE LOGISTICAL ISSUES IN THIS BILL SIMILAR TO THOSE IN SB FOURTEEN THIRTY SEVEN WHICH IS STILL THE SUBJECT OF EXTENSIVE LITIGATION. USUALLY THE APPLICATION OF SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE TWO CONVICTIONS THAT RESULTED FROM NEGOTIATED PLEASE THAT CONTAIN NO ADMISSIBLE RECORD OF CONVICTION FOR AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING IS PROBLEMATIC TO SAY THE LEAST. ADDITIONALLY THE REAL LIFE AFFECTED THE NUMBER OF THE PROCEDURAL PROVISIONS OF THE BILL WOULD BE TO ALLOW EVERYONE CONVICTED OF MANSLAUGHTER OR ATTEMPTED MURDER TO SUCCESSFULLY PETITIONED TO HAVE A RESENTENCING HEARING REGARDLESS OF THE UNDERLYING THEORY ADVANCED BY THE PROSECUTION COUPLED WITH THE BURDEN ON THE PROSECUTION TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THE PETITIONERS IN ELIGIBILITY FOR RESENTENCING SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL EFFECTIVELY AUTHORIZED THE RELEASE OF THOSE WHO ATTEMPTED TO KILL AND THOSE WHO PLAYED MAJOR ROLES IN THE KILLING OF OTHERS. WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO FINDING REASONABLE AND MEASURED APPROACHES TO FELONY MURDER REPORT HOWEVER THIS BILL FALLS FAR SHORT OF THAT GOAL AND CREATE SOME POTENTIALLY DISASTROUS AND COSTLY PROBLEMS THAT RENDER THIS BILL ON WORKABLE IF APPROVED IT WOULD CREATE NOTHING SHORT OF A WINDFALL FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGED IN CONCERTED EFFORTS TO TAKE A HUMAN LIFE AND WHO HAVE BEEN JUSTLY AND APPROPRIATELY PUNISHED US. FOR A NO VOTE. THANKS SIR. THANK YOU. NOW LET'S MOVE BACK TO FORTY TWO HE WILL HEAR IN THE CHAMBER HERE I SEE NO WITNESSES ARE. AND SOPRON IN OPPOSITION WILLING TO- WANTING TO TESTIFY WILL MOVE NOW TO ROOM TWENTY FORTY I SEE NO WITNESSES THERE. SOON NOW MISS A MODERATOR WILL MOVE TO THE PHONE LINES DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES IN Q. WANTED TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE.

SOONER WHEN WE HAVE A MOTION ABOUT FOR SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS AS IT RELATES TO THIS NO QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SENATOR BAKER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. I THINK RECONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST AN AYE VOTE ARE WE HAVE A MOTION TO DO FAST TO BE RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS CONSULTANT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE SB SEVEN SEVEN FIVE BRADFORD HI I PROVIDE A CHOI BOGUE NOW. TO ABOVE NO COM LONGER. COMMA ICE. WE WIENER II THREE VOTES DAVID. THREE ONE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS NOW WE WILL MOVE TO NOW THANK YOU SENATOR BAKER. OUR MOVE TO FILE ITEM T. AND S. B. THREE FIVE SEVEN. SENATOR WIENER FROM YOUR DUSTER FROM THE PODIUM WHATEVER YOU WHATEVER YOUR PLEASURE OKAY. I UNDERSTAND. YEAH WHEN WHENEVER YOU'RE READY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- AND COLLEAGUES- I'M PRESENTING SENATE BILL THREE FIVE SEVEN- WHICH REPEALS PROVISIONS AND OUR PENAL CODE THAT CRIMINALISE LOITERING WITH INTENT TO ENGAGE IN SEX WORK RELATED OFFENSES. SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN ALSO PERMITS THE SEALING OF RECORDS FOR ANYONE PREVIOUSLY CONVICTED OF THIS LOITERING OFFENSE AND PROVIDES FOR RESENTENCING FOR ANYONE CURRENTLY SERVING A SENTENCE FOR THIS OFFENCE. SEN IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT LOUIS DURING FOR THE PURPOSES OF PROSTITUTION- IS NOT ONE OF LIKE THE OLD SCHOOL OFFENSES IN THE CALIFORNIA PENAL CODE'S BEEN AROUND FOREVER. IT WAS PUT INTO THE PENAL CODE IN NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. AND IT WAS- DONE AN EFFORT TO QUOTE UNQUOTE CLEAN UP THE NEIGHBORHOODS OF UNDESIRABLE- QUOTE UNQUOTE. PEOPLE THIS MISDEMEANOR OFFENSES FAILED TO PROTECT PUBLIC SAFETY. AND IT DISPROPORTIONATELY IS ENFORCED AGAINST BLACK AND BROWN WOMEN AND TRANS WOMAN. I DO TO THE BROAD AND SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THE LANGUAGE OF THIS OFFENSE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS GIVEN THE PERMISSION TO PROFILE PEOPLE TO STOP PEOPLE TO ARREST PEOPLE FOR INHERENTLY DISCRIMINATORY REASONS SUCH AS WHAT KIND OF CLOTHING. A PERSON IS WEARING WHO THEY'RE TALKING TO HOW THEY'RE WALKING IN OTHER WRDS YOU YOU'RE WEARING TIGHT CLOTHES YOU'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE- THERE WAS SEX WORK HAPPENING HERE- LAST WEEK SO THEREFORE I THINK YOU'RE- LOITERING WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT PROSTITUTION. AND SO THE OFFICER CAN ARREST THE PERSON THIS LAW AND CURRENTLY. ENGAGES IN PROFILING- CRIMINALIZING PEOPLE FOR LOITERING WITH INTENT TO ENGAGE IN SEX WORK SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASES MISTRUST BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND TARGET COMMUNITIES THIS MISTRUST IS DETRIMENTAL TO PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IT REINFORCES THAT STREET BASED SEX WORKERS- AND PARTICULARLY IN CHEMICAL BROWN COMMUNITIES AND TRANS COMMUNITIES. I THINK THOSE TO THEM THAT THEY SHOULD AT ALL COSTS AVOID LAW ENFORCEMENT. MODERATOR CAN YOU SHE WOULD GOING ON ONLINE OR HAVE SOMEONE MEET THEIR DEVICES PLEASE. CONTINUES WE ARE IDENTIFYING THE PROBLEM IF YOU ARE ON THE LINE PLEASE UTILIZE YOUR MUTE BUTTON WHEN NOT SPEAKING THANK YOU. TO THIS LAW- CREATES MISTRUST BETWEEN POLICE AND- BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES TRANS COMMUNITIES- AND SINGLES THE PEOPLE THAT THEY SHOULD NOT TRUST EVEN REPORTING CRIMES TO LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE THEY MIGHT GET. ARRESTED THEMSELVES. ON ONE PEOPLE INCLUDING SURVIVORS OF SEX TRAFFICKING ARRESTED FOR LOITERING- THEY SUBSEQUENTLY FACE MORE BARRIERS TO ACCESS SAFE HOUSING AND LEGAL EMPLOYMENT. EARLIER THIS YEAR NEW YORK STATE REPEALED A VERY SIMILAR OFFENSE THAT CRIMINALIZED LOITERING WITH INTENT TO ENGAGE IN SEX WORK AND TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO DO THE SAME. THIS BILL DOES NOT DECRIMINALIZE SOLICITING OR ENGAGING IN SEX WORK THAT IS A CONVERSATION. FOR ANOTHER DAY- SB THREE FIFTY SEVEN SIMPLY ELIMINATES AN ANTI LOITERING OFFENSE THAT RESULTS IN THE LEGAL PROFILING TARGETING AND HARASSMENT OF LGBTQ PEOPLE BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES SIMPLY FOR EXISTING AND SIMPLY BASED ON THE WAY THAT THEY LOOK THE WAY THEY WALK. ETCETERA I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS- WITH ME TODAY IS TESTIFIED BY PHONE ARAFAT TO MOST OF US WHO IS THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF FATIMA SPEAKS.

WELCOME SENATOR BRADFORD OR YOU MAY PRESENT YOUR BILL SB. FIVE SIX SEVEN. THANK YOU- FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN NINE AS DISAPPROVES UPON THE STATE FELONY THIS DETERMINATE SENTENCING LAW THAT WAS. PROVE THE NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND IT JUST CREATES A PRESUMPTIVE OF SENTENCING JUDGMENT NOT TO EXCEED THE MID TERM UNLESS THERE'S A GOOD. ACTIVATING US CIRCUMSTANCES THAT JUSTIFIED THE IMPOSITION OF P RETURN SB FIVE SIX SEVEN PROVIDES THAT WOUND UP FOR TERMS IMPOSED THERE HAS TO BE CERTAIN SUPPORTING FACTS SUCH AS STIPULATED BY THE DEFENDED AND SUBMITTED TO A JURY IMPROVING BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. OUR FOUND AND DETERMINED BY THE COURT IN A BENCH TRIAL IN INSTANCE WHERE THERE WAS NO TAKING- AUTHORS AMENDMENTS IN COMMITTEE TO REQUIRE THE TROUT. REQUIRED THE TRIAL ON THE SUBSTANTIVE CHARGES BE SEPARATED FROM THE TRIAL ON THE AGGRAVATED FACTORS IF DEFENDED THE REQUESTED- AGAIN AS OF INMATES WERE SERVING INDETERMINATE SENTENCE MOST CONVICTED FELONS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE A DETERMINATE SENTENCE BASED ON THE TRIAD OF SENTENCE STRUCTURE WITH LOWER MIDDLE AND UPPER TERMS IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE PENAL CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY STATES THAT IF THE STATUE SPECIFIES. THREE POSSIBLE SENTENCE. IN TERMS TO CHOICE OF THE PROPER TERM REST WITH THE DISCRETION OF THE COURT- THAT EXISTING LAW SUNSET IT. SUNSETS I SHOULD SAY IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- BEFORE TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THE PENAL CODE SECTION ELEVEN SEVENTY BE REQUIRED THE JUDGES IMPOSE A MID TERM. IN SENTENCING THE LESS THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES IN AGGRAVATION OR MITIGATION OF A CRIME THAT WARRANTS A LOWER OR UPPER TERM IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THE US SUPREME COURT HELD IN CUNNINGHAM VERSUS CALIFORNIA THAT CALIFORNIA'S DETERMINANT SENTENCING LAW WAS UNCONSTITUTIONAL THE COURT RULED THAT CALIFORNIA'S LAW. IMPERMISSIBLY ALLOWED JUDGES TO IMPOSE AN UPPER MAXIMUM TERM BASED UPON AGGRAVATING FACTS THAT WERE NEVER PRESENTED TO A JURY. AND DEEM TO BE TRUE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THUS VIOLATING THE SIXTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION- RIGHT TO JURY TRIAL BY JURY AND TWO THOUSAND SEVEN A LEGISLATIVE WITH LEGISLATURE ADOPTED.

FIVE NINETY AND IS NOW AGAIN- DUE TO SUNSET IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO- WHILE IT IS APPROPRIATE TO PUNISH PEOPLE FOR COMMITTING CRIME TO HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE. IMPACTED PEOPLE PROPER DUE PROCESS. THAT IS BUILT ON FAIRNESS AND FACT THAT FOSTERS REHABILITATION AND ALSO ACHIEVES A PUBLIC SAFETY GOAL THIS IS A PERFECT OF THIS BILL. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. AND I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT I HAVE- JOHN J. VASQUEZ WHO WORKED FOR WORKS AS A SPACIOUS SAY PARTICIPATE PARTICIPATION DEFENSE AND POLICY COORDINATOR FOR COMMUNITIES UNITED FOR RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND MY OTHER WITH THIS IS STEPHEN MARK MA KELT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CRIMINAL ATTORNEYS FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE. AND MR MCHALE HAS FORTY THREE YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AS AN ATTORNEY IN HIS- CERTIFIED SPECIALIST IN CRIMINAL LAW. AND ACTORS AT A TESTIMONY WILL TAKE. ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BY MR ASCUS. ON THAT NOTE I ASKED FOR A VOTE. I'M SORRY I'M IN CHARGE. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE FOR BRADFORD. IT'S BEEN A LONG LONG DAY. MMHM OKAY. DO WE HAVE WE HAVE TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES DO WE HAVE JOHN VASQUEZ ON THE LINE OR STEVEN MARKET. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND ALL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY. MY NAME IS JAY VAZQUEZ I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SUPPORTIVE MANAGEMENT POLICY COORDINATOR OKAY YOU UNITED PROVISIONAL TO JUSTICE AND POLITICAL SPONSOR OF. THAT SB FIVE SIX SEVEN. I'M ALSO MILLION CALL. HOW DO YOU SERVE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE PROCESS. THE AUTHENTICATED. SIXTY SO MY FRIEDMAN PROVOKES. NUMENERA IN PARTS OF THE PEOPLE PARTIALLY AND THE HIGHWAY OF THE COMMISSION. ON HOW TO MANY FACTORS. WHICH WERE NEVER PROVEN TO BE TRUE BY GERMAN. WOULD YOU MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS. PARTICIPANT USUAL PLACE HOLDING ON UNPROVEN ACCUSATIONS FROM TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE. MAJORITY OF VIETNAM MEDALS. I COME ACROSS. C. MOBILE AND IT WAS A HARD ARE BLACK AND BROWN. SB FIVE HUNDRED. NOT A GET OUT OF YOUR FREE CARD. ONE SEVEN ALLOWING JUDGES TOLD REPORTERS FOR THEIR ACTIONS. ALL PROVIDE A OPPORTUNITY. IT IS. NOT A VALID DAY- COMMITTEE BACK BEFORE YOU. YOUR MIND SURE USUALLY HARDER THANK ARE NOT AROUND OUT LITERALLY. ALL THE HARD WORK. BECAUSE HELLO TAXPAYERS MONEY. WE THOUSAND FOR EACH ADDITIONAL YEAR ON THE TERM. I THINK IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ALSO WHEN LAW WITH THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN YOU SUPREME COURT IS. CUNNINGHAM CALIFORNIA. SAID RENDON ANY TAX THEY DEPEND GREAT POTENTIAL CENTER MUST BE FOUND BY GERMAN NOT A JUDGE AND I WAS ON A DOUBT. NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED. AT THE- WHAT DO YOU REASONS ONLY QUIT YOUR I HOPE TO THANK YOU. FOR THE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IT'S OUR BEST GUESS IS MR STEVEN MARKET ON THE LINE. YES I AM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THE LEGISLATURE RESPONDED WITH SB FORTY VERY QUICKLY AFTER CUNNINGHAM DECISION HOWEVER. WE DON'T BELIEVE THE REFORM FIX THE PROBLEM. OUR COURTS ARE STILL REQUIRED TO STATE ON THE RECORD WHICH FAXIAN AGGRAVATION WERE FOUND TRUE BY THE JUDGE IN ORDER TO JUSTIFY AN OPPORTUNE. THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME JUDICIALFACT FINDING THE CUNNINGHAM FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. UNDER SB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN WHAT A PROSECUTOR THINKS THEY HAVE AN AGGRAVATED CASE THEY WILL ADD AGGRAVATING FACTORS TO THE INFORMATION WHICH CURRENTLY CHARGES FOR CRIMES AND ENHANCEMENTS. IF THE CASE GOES TO TRIAL AND ONLY THREE OUT OF A HUNDRED CASES GO TO TRIAL. THE COURT WILL BIFURCATE THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS AND THE JURY WILL RECEIVE EVIDENCE ON THE CHARGES IN HERE AND ENHANCEMENTS IF THE DEFENDANT IS FOUND GUILTY THEN THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE JURY. HOWEVER IN THE REAL WORLD THE STRUCTURE STEP WILL SELDOM OCCUR AND WILL TAKE VERY LITTLE COURT TIME OVERALL. FOR EXAMPLE IN CURRENT PRACTICE PRIOR CONVICTIONS OR BIFURCATED IN JUST THIS WAY. OFTEN THE DEFENDANT AFTER BEING CONVICTED WILL BAN ADMIT THE PRIORS OR WAIVE JURY AND WHAT THE COURT DECIDES THE PRIORS. AND THIS IS A VRY STANDARD PROCEDURE TODAY AND IT DOES NOT ADD SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE AVERAGE TIME FOR TRIALS IT'S VERY LIKELY THAT. SB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN WOULD CREATE A SIMILAR- EFFICIENT PROCESS OF DETERMINING THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS IN A TRIAL SITUATION. SO THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO LIMIT PROTECT PARTICIPATION OF VICTIMS IN THE CASE. THE VICTIM HAS A RIGHT TO EXPRESS VIEWS ON SENTENCING WAS SET UP IN PROPOSITION ONE FIFTEEN OTHERS- NEITHER. SECTIONALISM SEVENTY NOR THE STATE CONSTITUTION LIMIT WHAT THEY CAN SAY IF THE VICTIM WANTS TO ARGUE FOR THE DEATH PENALTY FOR AN EMBEZZLER. THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT. BUT THE COURT CANNOT ORDER THAT UNLAWFUL ENTRY. WE CUNNINGHAM HOLDING WAS QUOTE THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM IS A MAXIMUM SENTENCE OF JUDGMENT POEMS. ON THE BASIS OF A FACT REFLECTED IN THE JURY VERDICT OR ADMITTED BY THE DEFENDANT. TODAY A CALIFORNIA JUDGE MAY NOT IMPOSE THE AGGRAVATED TERM WITHOUT SPECIFICALLY FINDING SOME AGGRAVATING FACTORS. BUT THOSE FACTS HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND BY THE JURY OR ADMITTED BY THE DEFENDANT HENCE THE SYSTEM IS STILL A VIOLATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT. SB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN WILL FIX THAT AND DO IT EFFICIENTLY. WE ASK FOR OUR VOTE AND I WILL REMAIN AVAILABLE IF THERE ARE QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR MARKET- WE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO- ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM FORTY TWO OR THREE CNN. ARE THERE ANY WITTICISM TWENTY FORTY WHO WAS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIVE. FIVE SIX SEVEN.

GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS BORN AFTER I'VE AN ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY FOR THE COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ AND I SPENT FOUR AND A HALF YEARS AS A DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL DOING CRIMINAL APPELLATE WORK BUT HE GETTING KIND OF SPEED MANUTIUS CALIFORNIA'S. WE'LL SEND THEM. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION WE ARE AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY SEVEN. AS THE BILL HAS NOTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT WHEN CUNNINGHAM VERSUS CALIFORNIA HELP THAT CALIFORNIA'S DETERMINATE SENTENCING SCHEME I THINK THE GOOD. WAS NOT SUFFICIENTLY ADVISORY. THE THREE PROPOSED PRISON TERMS THE MEDICATED THE MIDDLE AND AGGRAVATED THE JUDGE WAS REQUIRED TO IMPOSE THE MIDDLE TERM AND LET THE CONTRACTORS AN AGGRAVATION. THE MIDDLE TERM THAT OPERATED AT THE STATUTORY MAXIMUM LEGALLY AND ANY FACTORS IN AGGRAVATION HAD TO BE QUITE IMPRUDENT BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT TO A JURY. WHAT THE POTENTIAL FOR COSTLY. THREE MONTHS AFTER CUNNINGHAM THE LEGISLATURE PASSED SENATE BILL FORTY. SENATE BILL FOURTEEN MODEL. PARDON LITTLE BIT APPOINT UNDER MODEL THE FEDERAL SENTENCING SCHEME APPROVED BY THE SUPREME COURT IT GAVE JUDGES TRUE DISCRETIONARY POWER TO TAKE A HOLISTIC VIEW OF THE CASE AND IMPOSE THE APPROPRIATE PREFERABLE WE ALSO NOTE THAT THE JUDGE'S DISCRETION IS LIMITED JUDGES CANNOT IMPOSE A SENTENCE THAT IS ARBITRARY CAPRICIOUS OR- OR EVEN. GET DEFENDANT CAN SHOWER THAT FOR THE DISCRETION AGGRAVATING. MUST BE SUPPORTED BY SUBSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. EVIDENCE THAT IS A REASONABLE CREDIBLE AND SALAS AL YOU SO THE SENTENCING HEARING THE DEFENDANT IS EMPOWERED TO PRESENT HIS EVIDENCE AND CHALLENGE ANY EVIDENCE IN THE CORPORATION REPORT THAT THE PROSECUTOR PRESENT THAT THEY FEEL. IT'S NOT TRUE OR UNFAIR OR SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED. SENATE BILL FIVE SIXTY SEVEN SIXTY KIND OF UNWIND THE CLOCK FOURTEEN YEARS AND IMPLEMENT THE MORE COSTLY ALTERNATIVES SB FORTY. WHICH WOULD BE AMENDED THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED WE CREATE A BIFURCATED PENALTY PAID FOR EVERY FELONY CASE WHERE AN AGGRAVATED TERM WITH THE APPROPRIATE. MY FIRST CONCERN AFTER LEARNING ABOUT THIS AMENDMENT YESTERDAY I WELL IT DOESN'T DRAW SOME OF THE CONCERNS BE RAISED AND OUR OPPOSITION LETTER. WE HAVE TO CONSIDER WHAT THE PENALTY PHASE BIFURCATE A PENALTY PHASE YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK LIKE. THERE IS A TOUCHSTONE IN PENAL CODE SECTION ONE NINETY POINT THREE WHICH STRUCTURES THE CAPITAL CASE HELP YOU PAID. WHICH IS THE ONLY. WHERE THERE IS A VERY SUBSTANTIVE AN EXTENSIVE PENALTY PHASE BUT IT'S NOT A PERFECT TECHNOLOGY. WE'RE DEALING WITH Y. VICTIMS. AND DISCLOSURE CAN BE DELAYED OR PIECEMEAL. ACTUALLY TRUE IN SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES WE NOW KNOW THE SOCIETY BECAUSE THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIPS AND TRAUMA VICTIMS- COME OUT RIGHT AWAY WITH EVERYTHING THAT HAPPENED TO THEM SO THE QUESTION IS. CAN MEET PEOPLE AND MEN AT ANYTIME. TO MEET THE NEEDS OF VICTIMS IN THE CASE AND TO GIVE THE DEFENDANT PROPER NOTICE OF THE FACTORS IN AGGRAVATION OCCURRED THEY'RE GOING TO SEEK EMPLOYMENT. PART OF THE CONCERN IS RELATED TO A TWENTY TWENTY HEY FROM THE SUPREME COURT THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT PEOPLE THE ANDERSON. OR DEFENDANT IS ENTITLED TO ADEQUATE NOTICE. OF ANY FACTOR THAT IS GOING TO BE HERE JOIN. HER CONTENT. WHAT WE HAVE TO PLEAD IMPROVE THESE AT A PRELIMINARY HEARING WOULD OF COURSE HAVE THE DISCRETION TO STRIKE THEM. IF I THREE FINE ACTORS AN APPLICATION WAT THEY FIND COURT OVER TO COURT BE ABLE TO STRIKE THEM IMPOSE THE MIDDLE OR MITIGATED TERM. WITHOUT FURTHER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE PENALTY PHASE TRIAL FOR FELONY COOKBOOK LIKE. IT'S GOING TO BE A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY AND LITIGATION OVER LACK THAT WILL. RESULT IN. INCONSISTENT AND NON UNIFORM SENTENCING. THIS AFTER WOULD YOU MIND WRAPPING EVENT WERE RIGHT ABOUT FIVE MINUTES. YES ANOTHER CONCERN ARE RAISING COSTS A TWENTY ELEVEN REPORT ON THE DEATH PENALTY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT AT THE ADDITIONAL COST INCURRED BY PENALTY PHASES OF ONE OF THE REASONS WHY THE DEATH PENALTY IS EXPENSIVE MUCH MORE INVOLVED FOR YEAR TWELVE JURORS THAT ARE CAPABLE OF CONSIDERING JUST PASSIONATELY A FANFIC HIGH SKILLED ARE NOT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO KEEP UP ALL THE CONFLICTING TO EMBARK FELONY PENALTY PHASE WITH MUCH MORE EMOTIONALLY INTENSE EVIDENCE- IT'S OUR POSITION THAT JUDGES ARE ABLE TO HANDLE AND MORE DISPASSIONATELY HANDLE THIS EVIDENCE. AND FOR THAT REASON YOU MUCH MEMBERS ON SB. FIFTY FIVE SIX SEVEN THANK YOUNG CARE. LET'S ON TO WHO IN ROOM TWO THREE SEEN NONE ARE THEY ANY WHAT IS TO FORTY WISH TO. UP SB FIVE SIX SEVEN SEEN NONE.
