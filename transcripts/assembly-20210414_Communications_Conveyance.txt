GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. ONLY TWENTY MILES FROM OUR STATE'S CAPITAL IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY THEIR CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE NO ACCESS TO BROADBAND CONNECTIVITY AND THE ESTIMATED FINANCIAL NEED TO DEPLOY BROADBAND IN THIS SMALL REGION ALONE IS IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THERE ARE IN FACT CONNECTIVITY PROBLEMS IN URBAN AND RURAL AREAS THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE TECHNOLOGY STATE. ONE IN A CALIFORNIA HOME STILL DO NOT HAVE INTERNET ACCESS AND SMALL TOWNS RURAL AREAS YEAH COMMITTEE COMMUNITIES OF COLOR FACE EVEN HIGHER NUMBERS OF STUDENTS AND FAMILIES WHO REMAIN DISCONNECTED UNDER THE CURRENT STANDARDS. AND THE FCC IS CONSIDERING RAISING THOSE STANDARDS AS WE SPEAK. FURTHERMORE THE ONGOING COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS MADE MADE GLARINGLY CLEAR HOW CRITICAL CONNECTIVITY IS IN THESE TIMES OF EMERGENCIES INCLUDING THE MASSIVE JUST TRANSITION OF STUDENTS LEARNING FROM HOME. AND DURING THE STATE'S RECENT DEVASTATING DEVASTATING WILDFIRES. XCELERATED NEED FOR BROADBAND CAN NOT BE IGNORED. THIS THAT IS WHY I'M PARTNERING WITH SENATOR GONZALEZ AND TWO DOZEN OF OUR HOLDINGS AND I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR YOUR JOINT AUTHORSHIP TO ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THE STATE. OVER THE PAST MONTHS WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER ON A LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE THAT WILL MODERNIZE STANDARDS. AND UPDATE THEM AS THE FCC STANDARDS EVOLVED TO ADOPT NEW SPEEDS AND TECHNOLOGY. OUR BILLS BOTH PROVIDE ELIGIBILITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND FUNDING AT TWENTY FIVE DOWNLOAD THREE UPLOAD WITH A BUILD OUT OF TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE. AB FOURTEEN PRIORITIZES THE DEPLOYMENT OF BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE. UNSERVED AND UNDERSERVED RURAL AND URBAN AREAS WHILE OPENING THE DOOR FOR A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY IN THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES. WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT OR CHOOSES NOT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SERVICE. AB FOURTEEN PROVIDES FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE SURCHARGE ON TELECOM SERVICE M. BONDING FOR YEARS WHEN APPLICATIONS EXCEED THE INCOMING REVENUE TO BUILD PROJECTS OUT. WELL WE CONSIDER THE EXACT METHOD OF EXTENDING THAT SURCHARGE PERCENTAGE ELSE'S IN AB FOURTEEN OR A FLAT RATE UNDER S. BEFORE. WE ANTICIPATE THAT WIRELINE CUSTOMERS BE WILL ACTUALLY DECREASE. MY BILL ENSURES GRANTS ADMINSTERED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ARE AWARDED TO APPLICANTS WHO ARE WILLING AND ABLE AND QUICKLY AND EFFICIENTLY CONNECT HOUSEHOLDS COMMUNITY ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS SMALL BUSINESSES. AND EMPLOYERS BY MAKING ELIGIBLE ACRE INSTITUTIONS ALONG THE PATHWAY OF THE PROJECT. SO WE DON'T MISS OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE LINKAGES TO HEALTH. EDUCATION PUBLIC SAFETY AND EMERGENCY RESPONSE FACILITIES. MEMBERS OF THE PANDEMIC LAID BARE WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING. FOR WHAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR OVER A DECADE TO FIX. TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS MOST OF THEM WHO NEED THE MOST HELP DO NOT HAVE THE INTERNET TO SUPPORT THEIR HEALTHCARE TO SUPPORT THEIR EDUCATION TO SUPPORT JOB TRAINING TO SUPPORT THE MAJORITY OF SMALL BUSINESSES. WHO WORK FROM THE HOME TRYING TO COMPETE IN TODAY'S DIGITAL ECONOMY. WE HAVE ALSO WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY CREATE THOUSANDS OF JOBS FOR MORE CALIFORNIA WORKERS WHO WILL NEED TO HAVE THE SKILLS AND TRAINING. TO DELIVER THESE PROJECTS. AND AS WE WORK WITH MISTER SPEAKER AND THE ADMINISTRATION ON THE FINAL PACKAGE. I'M EXCITED TO CONTINUE OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THE STATE BUILDING TRADES AND COMMUNICATIONS WORKERS TO ASSURE CALIFORNIA WORKERS BENEFIT FROM THESE HIGH PAYING CAREERS THE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. A GREAT MANY OF US HERE ARE WORKING ON DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF THIS FIGHT. TOGETHER WE BUILT THE MOMENTUM TO SUCCEED THIS YEAR. NOW IS THE TIME TO SEIZE THE MOMENT AND BRING ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY FOR THEIR WORK. THEIR HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. TODAY I WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS TRISH KELLY ON BEHALF OF THE ALL THE VISION. AND EDUARDO GONZALEZ ON BEHALF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY REGIONAL BROADBAND CONSORTIUM AND FRESNO STATE. THANK YOU.

GOOD GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME SAID A LOT OF ON SITE IS REPRESENTING THE CULT THE OFFICE OF COMMUNITY AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY PRESS. WHICH ADMINISTERS THE FALCON VALLEY REGIONAL BROADBAND CONSORTIUM THAT'S WHAT THE CALIFORNIA PARTNERSHIP OF SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AS MENTIONED BEFORE ONE IN CALIFORNIA'S HOMES ARE NOT CONNECTED TO THE INTERNET ALLOWS SIX PERCEPTIBLE IN THE PAST SEVERAL MONTHS A CONSORTIUM WORKING CLOSELY WITH. LOCAL STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS HAVE IDENTIFIED MORE THAN SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS IN A COUNTY REGION WITH LIMITED OR NO ACCESS TO BROADBAND. THESE HOUSEHOLDS ARE BOTH IN URBAN AND RURAL LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS MAKING THE BROADBAND DIGITAL DIVIDE A CALIFORNIA AN EQUITY ISSUE TODAY I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR ABLE TO SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN US STRATEGIC SOLUTION TO CONNECTING STUDENTS FAMILIES AND BUSINESS OWNERS WHO REMAIN. DISCONNECTED UNDER CURRENT STANDARDS IT BROADBAND HAD A TIME IT IS NOW. BUT HOW CAN WE FIX CALIFORNIA'S BROADBAND NEEDS WHAT MENTAL BUNDY AND CONTINUES PRAYERS TO DEPLOYMENT CREATED BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR ALL CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY LIVE THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS AND HOUSEHOLD INCOME ARE ENTITLED TO THE SAME PRIVILEGES THAT YOU AND I. HAVE WHILE GETTING ONLINE AND SECURING AN ADEQUATE BROADBAND SPEED APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT WHAT THE PRIVATE SECTOR BELIEVES. DUST THIS IS WHERE AB FOURTEEN COMES TO PLAY OUR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE CONNECTIVITY TO THEIR OWN COMMUNITIES WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR CANNOT OR CHOOSES NOT TO PROVIDE SUFFICIENT SERVICE. AB FOURTEEN PROVIDES FOR AN EXTENSION OF THE SURCHARGE ON TELECOM SERVICE AND TWENTY FOUR YEARS ADDITIONALLY ASMENTIONED AP FOURTEEN INSURANCE GRANTS ADMINISTERED BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION.

WE SUPPORT AB FOURTEEN BECAUSE IT WILL PROVIDE THE CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN HIDING AFTER STRUCTURE IN BOTH URBAN AND RURAL AREAS EXPAND FUNDING ELIGIBILITY INCLUDING FOR LOCAL AND TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS ENABLING NEW SOLUTIONS WHERE THE PRIVATE SECTOR IS NOT INVESTING CONNECT ANCHOR INSTITUTIONS ALONG THE PATH OF DEPLOYMENT AND IMPROVE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE CATS OF PROGRAMS OR PROJECTS ARE COMPLETED SOONER.

THANK YOU AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY- ARGUMENT HERE THAT THIS IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST ISSUES THIS YEAR- MAKING SURE THAT WE'VE GOT- COVERAGE THROUGH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY DEALING WITH THE SCHOOLS AND WITH COVERT I DO I pRIGHT NOW THERE'S UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF ATTENTION TAX INCREASE THAT THE P. YOU SEE- COULD GO AHEAD WITH NOT TO MENTION THAT I DO BELIEVE THAT THEY COULD ALSO HAVE NO EXPIRATION DATE ON THIS FOR ME TO BE ABLE VOTE ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS I REALLY NEED TO KNOW THE NUMBERS ESPECIALLY- THE FACT THAT RIGHT NOW.

CUSTOMER COMMITTEE IS TO GO THROUGH THE TEARS JUST TO I REALIZE. AN AWKWARD SETTING. STUFF ABSOLUTELY I UNDERSTAND CONCERN. WE ARE WORKING WITH THE SENATE AND SALAS I HAVE A IN MY BUILT A- PERCENTAGE IN HER SHE HAS A FLAT RATE SO WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION WITH THE SPEAKER AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO COME TO A LANDING POINT IS AS WELL WITH THE SI SI PC. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE A BILL LIKE THIS HAS A LOT OF MOVING PARTS AND THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE AND THEN AN IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS THAT WE HAVE- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THOSE THE P. PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL ON LAND LINES THEY'RE PLAYING THE BRUNT OF THIS. THE THIRTIES EQUAL TO EVERYONE ELSE IS SO WE HAVE THE HOPE THIS IS TO DECREASE THAT AND AS WE KNOW WHO ARE THE PEOPLE THAT GENERALLY HAVE THE LAND LINES ARE RURAL COMMUNITIES ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR THAT STILL ON THE LAND LINE I PEOPLE IN URBAN AREAS STILL HAVE THAT AS WELL SO OUR GOAL IS TO BRING THOSE DOWN BECAUSE MANY PEOPLE ARE GETTING RID OF THEIR LAN LINE. SO WE DEPEND ON THE FUNDING RIGHT NOW AND IF THAT GOES AWAY THAT FUND THE KEEPS GOING DOWN SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE THIS FUN BECAUSE AS WE KNOW TECHNOLOGY CHANGES ALL THE TIME AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR ME AND I THINK ALL OF US HERE IS THAT WE'VE SEEN THE SOMETIMES WE STOP WE GET MOMENTUM AND WE STOPPED. AND THEN WHAT WE DO WE END UP COMING BACK AND ASKING ASKING FOR A BIG TAX REFUND OR WHATEVER SOI JUST WANT TO MAKE CLEAR IS THAT WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO PUT THAT IN THERE AND I WANT TO ASSURE YOU THAT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS WEEK BUT. WOULD BE ADDING AMENDMENTS AS WELL. THANK YOU. LOW THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF I COULD I COULD TO THE CHERUB QUESTION AND COMMENT- MAYBE FIRST- JUST A COMMENT ON. TO SOMEONE AGUIAR-CURRY IT JUST BROKE. MY HEART TO HEAR YOU TALK IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS ABOUT THE SITUATION THAT EXIST. AS YOU KNOW I WASBORN AND RAISED IN CURRENTLY LIVE IN SILICON VALLEY. AND I COULD NOT FATHOM. COULD NOT FATHOM THE SAME TYPE OF SCENARIOS AND SITUATIONS AND JUST. THE DEVASTATION ESPECIALLY IF WE'RE AS WE'RE SO RELIANT ON TECHNOLOGY THAT EXISTS AND FRANKLY THE CONSTITUENTS THAT I WORK FOR AND REPRESENT TAKE IT FOR GRANTED. AND I JUST ONLY IMAGINE- THE SUFFERING THAT THAT EXIST AND- TO REAFFIRM THE COMMITMENT NOT JUST. I DON'T COME FROM A RURAL AREA BUT THE ROOF FROM THE COMMITMENT AND SUPPORT. MAKE KNOWLEDGE MENT OF THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE OVER THE PAST YEARS CLOSE TO DECADES OF WORK IN THIS AREA. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CONTINUE TO ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS BUT MY QUESTION IS. WHAT DO WE NEED TO DO TO ACTUALLY PUSH THIS THROUGH AND I KNOW. THE CHAIRS ALSO BEEN ACTIVE IN THIS SPACE TO IN A CRUISE TO THE TO THE CHAIR. BUT WHAT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO TO HELP MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THIS ACROSS THE FINISH LINE. WITH IMPORTANT PIECES FOR US IS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH LEADERSHIP. AND THEY HELP US PUT THIS OVER THE FINISH LINE- WE'RE HAVING WORKING GROUP'S- MISTER SPEAKER HAS BEEN NOTHING BUT MORE UP IN SUPPORT OF THIS. AS WELL AS MY COLLEAGUES. AND YOU KNOW WE CAN GO OVER AND OVER AND OVER WHAT WE NEED WHAT WE NEED WE'VE DONE THIS FOR THREE YEARS NOW. ALL WE DID WAS SIXTY AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE. THE TIME IS RUNNING OUT FOR THE FEE AND WE'RE STILL WORKING WITH A CONSORTIUM. WE NEED TO GET THIS ACROSS THE LINE IF YOU KNOW IF YOU SEE OUR SUPPORT PEOPLE SAYING WHY NOT. AND I WILL- PUT EVERYTHING INTO THIS THAT THIS IS GOING TO GET DONE IT'S GOT TO BE URGENT. PEOPLE ARE LOOKING FOR US TO MAKE THIS MOVE. THE ECONOMY IS LOOKING FORWARD OUR STUDENTS LOOK FOR HEALTH CARE IS LOOKING FOR SO. ANYWAY THAT YOU CAN HELP WHETHER IT'S HEALTH CARE TALKING ABOUT HEALTH CARE THE IMPORTANCE OF HAVING TELEHEALTH. AND TO HAVE THE BROADBAND. INFRASTRUCTURE ANYWAY WE CAN HELP AND MOVE OUR.% GOVERNOR LONG I'M I KNOW THAT THE HE'S MADE THIS IS THE- I KNOW THE CURRENT. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS MADE. A PRIOR. M. US REMEMBER THE GENTLEMAN A COMMENT HE SAID- THAT THE BIDEN INFRASTRUCTURE INITIATIVE WAS WHERE WE CAN GET MORE MONEY. CALTEX CALTEX THE NATIONAL AFFILIATES OPPOSE THE BIDEN AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE CONCERT SO WE GOT TO MAKE SURE WE GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD I CAN'T BELIEVE WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE WE KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF INTERNET MARKETING COMMUNITIES. NO IS AS THEM AND AS I REPRESENT NETFLIX IN THE STREAMING AND APPLE ALSO MY DISTRICT AND THAT'S A LUXURY WARES YOU JUST THE BASIC FUNDAMENTALS TO LIVE- IS IT IS NOT SOMETHING THAT CASH EVERY DAY CALIFORNIANS HAVE SO- WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE CHAIR I ALSO WOULD MAKE A MOTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR- PASSIONS ISSUE THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. AMONG IN IS WELL LOOKS WITH A SECOND. THE SECOND MICHAEL TELESCOPES. YOUR FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR ON A SUMMIT MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY HAS BEEN WORKING TIRELESSLY ON THIS INITIATIVE BUT NOT JUST SINCE THE PANDEMIC WELL BEFORE AS AN EDUCATOR I WANT TO SAY THAT. SOME OF OUR FAMILIES WEREFACED NOT ONLY WITH A PANDEMIC BUT ALSO SOME OF OUR FAMILIES OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS AND THEN THEY WERE FACED WITH HOW DO WE EDUCATE OUR OWN CHILDREN. IN OUR HOME. SOMETIMES A VERY DENSE HOUSING WHERE THERE THREE TO FIVE PEOPLE TRYING TO ACCESS SO EVEN IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS BROADBAND WE STILL SAW THAT IT WAS DIFFICULT SO THEN IMAGINE YOURSELF NOW. LIVING IN A PLACE WHERE CONNECTIVITY IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT IF AT ALL IF IT EXISTS AT ALL. THIS BILL IS NOT ONLY TIMELY BUT- WE ARE OUT OF TIME IN THE SENSE THAT WE KNOW THAT IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT EDUCATION BUT IT'S ALSO ABOUT EMERGENCY SERVICES AS WAS JUST NOTED. ON TELEHEALTH THE PANDEMIC HAS BROUGHT A WAY ABOUT IN LIFE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE AFTER THE PANDEMIC SO WE VERY WELL MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE SENIORS ACCESS HEALTH THROUGH- INTERNET WE MAY CONTINUE TO HAVE- STUDENTS TO CHOOSE AFTER. THIS EXPERIENCE TO CONTINUE ONLINE SCHOOL- IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SO WE HAVE TO HAVE THE BASICS IN PLACE WE HAVE TO HAVE THE SYSTEM IN PLACE. FOR THOSE CHOICES AND- WE ALSO HAVE DISCOVERED THAT WE HAVE AN ENTIRE REMOTE WORKING A GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO NOW HAVE THE CHOICE IN ARE BEING GIVEN THE CHOICE BECAUSE OF OUR- A LARGE CORPORATIONS WHO HAVE SAID WE CAN. IN FACT HAVE OUR WORKERS WORKING FROM HOME WITH THIS ALL RELIES ON A SUSTAINABLE WELL FUNCTIONING- BROADBAND THAT IS ACCESSIBLE THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO NOT ONLY DO I SUPPORT THIS BUT I AM A JOINT AUTHORS. AND A PROUD TO BE A SECOND TODAY AND TO DO ANYTHING I CAN HELP MOVE THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I WANT TO TALK TO THE OTHER SIDE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING ON THIS OER LAST YEAR'S NOT AND- THAT'S NOT AN EASY LIFT BUT IT'S ONE THAT'S INCREDIBLY. UNNECESSARY ALL OF US KNOW THE BROADBAND DISCONNECT IN A LOT OF COMMUNITIES OKAY BUT WE DON'T EXPERIENCE THEM AS MY COLLEAGUE. ADAM CAMPBELL HAD MENTIONED. YOUR ORDER DID A PANDEMIC- MOST SOME OF US HAVE DRIVEN BACK AND FORTH AND- IT'S INCREDIBLE TO THINK THAT IN THE CALIFORNIA IT IS COMPLETELY- DIGITAL IN SOME WAYS AND CAN WE TAKE FOR GRANTED MAYBE IN SOME URBAN AREAS THAT WE HAVE CONNECTIVITY BUT- I WILL TELL YOU THE SIX HOUR DRIVE FIVE AND A HALF HOUR DRIVE. YOU GET CONNECTION MAYBE ONE HOUR OF THAT ENTIRE TIME IN- AND I SENATE FEEL SORRY FOR ME BECAUSE I DRIVE DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT BUT BUT THE ISSUE IS THAT IT. WHEN YOU REALLY TAKE A LOOK AT CALIFORNIA IT'S IN. THE IN THE QUALITY WHEN IT COMES TO CONNECTION. IS EXTRAORDINARY- THAT IN SIX HOURS FIVE AND A HALF HOURS AND IN FACT THAT TAKEN A BUNCH OF PHONE CALLS ON THIS ISSUE FOR AND AGAINST IT CONTINUOUSLY DROP PEOPLE ALL THE TIME IT'S ALMOST FRUSTRATING UNDERSTAND HOW YOU CAN LIVE IN THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND HAVE ENTIRE COMMUNITIES HUGE BLOCKS OF CALIFORNIA WITHOUT THE INABILITY TO CONNECT. AND AND SO THE AUTHOR HAS MADE A STRONG COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK- TO LEGISLATIVE PROCESS ON THIS ISSUE. I KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF-QUESTIONS AND I'VE HAD A LOT OF FOUR CALLS A LOT OF OFFICE CALLS AND HAVING TRAINERS BUT- HERE'S HERE'S WHAT'S AT STAKE. NOT GETTING THIS DONE. LEAVE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY RULE AREAS- PLACE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WHO WILL NEVER HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY CONNECT. AND THAT'S THAT'S WHAT'S INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO MOVE THIS ALONG FOR. AND ENGAGE IN THAT CONVERSATION L. IT WAS HARLEQUIN EIGHTY SIXTY SIXTY FIVE I WAS PUT ON THE TABLE IN A DIFFERENT TIME A DIFFERENT PLACE- BUT MR GARCIA AND OTHERS. IT IS BEEN INCREDIBLE. AND I SAID THIS FOR APARTHEID BUT BUT BACK TO ME STILL BAFFLING. HOW WE'RE STILL HAVING THIS CONVERSATION ABOUT NOT HAVING. KEEP A CERTAIN COMMUNITIES NOT CONNECTED AT ALL AND EVEN IN TELEHEALTH HAS BECOME MORE IMPORTANT. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS BEEN EXACERBATED BY COLUMBIA. THE STUDENTS OUR COMMUNITY SAID NO WAY TO CONNECT AND YOU JUST NEVER REALLY IMAGINED. WHO WERE STRUGGLING TO CONNECT STUDENTS TO SCHOOL THEY'VE BEEN STRUGGLING TO CONNECT. ANYTHING SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE INTERNET SORT OF SPEAK AND SO FOR THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO GET THIS OUT- AND THE CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION- TO THEM SO THAT THE RIGHT BOUNCE IT IS- IT IS. IS DELIVERED TO THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND IT WE FINALLY START TO MAKE THAT IMPACT OF CONNECTING ALL COMMUNITIES ADDRESS STATE GOVERNMENT NOT I TYPICALLY WOULD CLOSE IT NOW WE DID HAVE A COLLEAGUE OF OURS WHO STEP IN A LITTLE BIT LATE WERE UNDER COBRA DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT THE A. M. EVERYBODY'S RUNNING BACK AND FORTH. ALLOW I KNOW BECAUSE YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT IN JUST ONE ABLE TO GET HERE BEFORE I PULLED MY MAKE UP. IF IT TOOK YOU TO COMMITTEE THIS WAS GOING TO CLOSE THE STATEMENT I LOVE I LIKE TO ALLOW LEAVES ONE MINUTE- TO THE PREVIOUS ORDER THE BILL BUT WE DO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON IT I THINK IT'S HER ROLE AT THAT YOU TOOK THIS UP AT A TIME THAT IT'S MOST NEEDED. AND IT'S BUSINESS IT'S AND IT'S BEEN MOST DEMONSTRATED EVEN IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ONE IMAGE OF TWO KIDS OUTSIDE. OF A TACO BELL- TRYING TO CAN TO THE- AND TRYING TO GET INTO. THOSE KIDS ARE NOT GONNA GET THAT BY. THAT SAME OPPORTUNITIES OTHER KIDS AND HAVE NOT. IN THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL REALLY SEEKING TO. I TO ADDRESS. AGGRESSIVE ACTUALLY BOOKED ONLY BECAUSE OF THOSE OPPOSING COMMON IT WILL MOVE ON A SET THANK YOU I WILL NOT- STILL YOUR THUNDER MISTER CHAIR BUT I WILL JUST SAY THAT- I RECOGNIZE THAT THE BILL. IS NOT IN ITS FINAL FORM. WE'VE HAD A WORK GROUP- BACK HOME OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT HAVE BEEN- PROVIDING- FEEDBACK TO THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL AND- OTHER STAKEHOLDERS ENGAGING. I JUST WANTED TO READ SOME OF THE POINTS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED- AND AGAIN RECOGNIZING THAT IT'S NOT IN ITS FINAL FORM AND SO WE WANT TO MAINTAIN. PRIORITY FOR THE TWENTY FIVE PRETTY UN SERVED. DEFINITION I THINK THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. TO FOLKS THE ABILITY FOR TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO BE TREATED EQUALLY AS AN APPLICANT'S AS OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES AS WELL OF LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES IS BEEN. EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AS WELL TO THE TRIBAL AND NON TRIBAL. MEMBERS OF THIS WORK GROUP BACK HOME AND ABILITY. FOR INTERCONNECTION OF UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS AND ANCHORS ADDITIONS ALONG THE PATH OF DEPLOYMENT INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY. OF MOBILE HOME PARKS AND AGRICULTURAL HOUSING ALSO A POINT THAT HAS BEEN RAISED. PRIVATIZING PROJECTS TO MAXIMIZE FEDERAL OR LOCAL FUNDS CLEARLY IT HAS TO BE A PRIORITY AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE- ALSO DISCUSSING ANOTHER MEASURE. AFTER AFTER THIS BILL WITH OUR COLLEAGUE AL MURATSUCHI- PRIORITIZE PROJECTS ALLOW OPEN SOURCE OF THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE- I THINK IT'S BEEN A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION- TO TRY TO. MAXIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE DIG ONCE I HAVE. A CONCEPT. TO REFORM THE CURRENT WAY PROJECTS ARE PRIORITIZED IN THE BILL IN ORDER TO HELP SIMPLIFY THE ULTIMATE. ADMINISTRATION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL MAINTAINING PRIORITY OF UNSERVED COMMUNITIES I THINK THAT IS THE SPIRIT. OF THE BILL AND JUST THOUGHT IT WOULD REINFORCE THAT- IN THE WORKGROUP I BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT LANGUAGE INSTRUCTING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO CONSULT WITH REGIONAL CONSORTIA ABOUT PLANNING. APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION SEEMS TO. MAYBE BE SELECTIVE OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS VERSUS. OTHER APPLICANTS- THERE SO THERE'S A TO POUND THAT I KNOW THAT THE- THAT IS SOMETHING BEEN- IMPORTANT TO OUR LOW. IN THE FINAL POINT. TO MAKE DELIVER OF THE WRITER FOR REFUSAL I BELIEVE IS SOMETHING THAT. HAS CAUSED A LOT OF DELAYS. WHEN IT COMES TO PC PROCESSING OF. CALIFORNIA ADVANCED SERVICES FUND CLEARLY THE ISSUE OF THE- I. P. EXTENSION HOW LONG IT GOES FOR- WILL BE FUNDAMENTALLY IMPORTANT AND LONG TERM AND- JUST WANTED TO NOTE THOSE POINTS- THAT CAME FROM THE WORKING GROUP BACK HOME. AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THOSE COMMENTS THANK YOU AGAIN AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU. SURE AND- I BELIEVE YOU DELIVER YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS OF THE LIKE TO NOW. WELL FIRST OF ALL I WOULD LIKE TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA AS WELL AS AND SANTIAGO WE'VE WORKED ON THIS TOGETHER FOR QUITE SOME TIME. WE'VE GIVEN OUR HEART AND SOUL TO THIS WE BELIEVE IN THEIR CONSTITUENTS BUT WE BELIEVE IN ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE OUT EQUAL ACCESS TO THE INTERNET. I DO WANT TO CLARIFY A COUPLE THINGS THAT THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT UP WITH QUICK LIKE IF YOU DON'T MIND. I WOULD REMIND YOU THIS IS NOT A TAX. MEMBERS THIS IS THE FEE THE ESTIMATES FROM THE ADMINISTRATION FOR SEVEN BILLION JUST FOR INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS FOR CONNECTIVITY. AT THE CURRENT RATE THE SURCHARGE WOULD TAKE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS TO FIND UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA SO YOU EITHER SUPPORT PROVIDING THE FUNDING TO MEET THE NEED FOR YOUR CONSTITUENTS OR YOU DON'T BUT PLEASE LET'S NOT GLOSS OVER THAT REALITY. I IN RESPONSE TO THE C. CTAS AMENDMENTS WE ARE ABSOLUTELY GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A CAROLINE AND HER GROUP WE APPRECIATE SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT SHE HAD WE'RE GOING TO ADDRESS OUR CONCERNS THAT SHE'S BROUGHT UP. AND I HAVE COMMITTED TO OUR MANY TIMES BEFORE THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH HER AS WELL AS OTHERS THAT COME TO THE TABLE. AND I ALSO WANT TO SAY IS THAT I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYONE THAT HAS ANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL- BUT IT. INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS. IS JUST EXPENSIVE. AND THEIR CONTENT ALL OF OUR CONSTITUENTS. DIRECTLY BENEFIT- PEOPLE DON'T OPPOSE FEES THEY CAN SEE THE BENEFITS WHEN THEY SEE THE BENEFIT THEY HAVE CONNECTIVITY. HE'S REALLY DON'T COME TO THE SURFACE LIKE YOU THINK. WITHOUT MINISTERS.

MEMBERS THANK YOU AGAIN I'M HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB ELEVEN HUNDRED WHICH REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACE NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER MERGING SEIZE ORDERS DISASTERS. YOU KNOW IN MY WITH MY DISTRICT WE HAD WILDFIRES IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND EIGHTEEN IT CAUSED MASSIVE DEVASTATION FROM PROPERTY LOSS TO TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK DAMAGE. MANY PEOPLE REPORTED THEIR MOBILE PHONES WENT DARK AND INTERNET SERVICE WENT OUT THE FILLED TOWERS WERE DAMAGED AN UNDERGROUND FIBER LINES BURNED. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AN ONLINE SURVEY FOUND THAT 64% OF RESPONDENTS IN CINEMA COUNTY AS WELL FIRE AFFECTED AREAS LOS LANDLINE PHONE SERVICE. JUST LAST YEAR THE TWENTY TWENTY LOSS FIRE REPORTEDLY DAMAGED TELECOMMUNICATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE CAUSING DISRUPTIONS IN PHONE SERVICE IN THE AFFECTED AREA. STATE YOU SEE HAVE FOCUSED HEAVILY ON THE UTILITIES RESPONSE TO THE MASSIVE DESTRUCTION. EVEN TODAY LITTLE IS KNOWN ABOUT THE FULL IMPACT OF THESE NATURAL DISASTERS HAVE HAD ON TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORKS AND HOW TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES HAVE RESPONDED. CONCRETE RECOVERY PLANS ARE NOT SHARED WITH THE P. YOU SEE ARE THE LEGISLATURE. WHOSE JOB IT IS TO OVERSEE THESE COMPANIES AND REPRESENT THE PUBLIC'S INTEREST WE NEED THIS INFORMATION TO MAKE SURE GOVERNMENT. A GOVERNMENT ARE HELPING TO REPAIR EFFORTS AND NOT IMPEDING THE RESTORATION. AB ELEVEN HUNDRED REQUIRES THE P. YOU SEE TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE PROVIDERS EFFORTS TO REPAIR AND REPLACEMENT WORK INFRASTRUCTURE AFTER MURTY'S OR DISASTERS. AB ELEVEN HUNDRED NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT STATE REGULATORS AND PUBLIC OFFICIALS AREN'T FORMED A TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICE FAILURES AND NETWORK NETWORK DAMAGE AFTER A NATURAL DISASTER. I WANT TO STRESS. THAT THE BILL'S REQUIRED REPORTING IS NOT REQUIRED TO BE SUBMITTED DURING EMERGENCIES THEMSELVES. WITHOUT INFORMATION THEM THE METHOD OF TECHNOLOGY TO REBUILD THERE'S NO WAY TO ENSURE THE RESIDENTS HAVE THE SAME OR IMPROVE ACCESS TO RELIABLE NETWORK. FOR MOST CALIFORNIANS RELIABLE VOICE TELEPHONE SERVICES NECESSARY TO REACH NINE ONE ONE. WITHOUT IT THE ABILITY TO CONTACT EMERGENCY SERVICES THIS LIMITED OR NONEXISTENT. WITH E TO TESTIFY- ON THE PHONE AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS R. CHRISTINE MAY YOU STAFF ATTORNEY FOR TURN AND FRANK- SAY THE C. W. A. DISTRICT NOW. THANK YOU. Q. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE LEGISLATION- TURN INTO SOMETHING THIS BILL AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL FOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACKNOWLEDGED THREE CURRIES WORK ON BILL. BECAUSE WE SEE A GAP IN KNOWLEDGE AND INFORMATION ABOUT OUR STATE COMMUNICATIONS NETWORK AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE BELIEVE THIS BILL IS NARROWLY TAILORED TO REQUIRE THE COMMISSION TO REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE TO FILL THIS KNOWLEDGE GAP. THIS BILL REALLY IS A KEY PART OF THE PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE JUST DISCUSSING WITH EIGHTY FOURTEEN TO SUPPORT EXTENDING ADVANCED SERVICES ALL OF CALIFORNIA AND TO CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. HISTORICALLY REGULATORS POLICYMAKERS. KERRIER DETAILED AND SPECIFIC IN. ABOUT THE STATE'S COMING. INDUSTRY YOU ALL KNOW WORK THINGS QUICKER AND HELPING WORK. TO THE UP THE REST. AND SHIFT THE MARKET AND TECHNOLOGY. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE FEAST ON. THAT THE NET BUT CHANGE BUT THE NEED FOR THE TYPE OF KNOWLEDGE AND FROM CAN TO CRITICAL. ECONOMIC TO PUBLIC SPEECH AT AT FAIRNESS. YES THE LETTER ENACTED. ARE USING THEIR BASE. OF THE AUTHOR DOES. THROUGH THE FORTUNATE ABOUT PLEASE OVER THE PAST YEARS BY. WHILE. OF TECHNOLOGIES AND THE TYPES OF EQUIPMENT THAT WILL BE REPLACING THE OLD DAMAGED NOT WORK TO BE CLEAR THIS BILL IS NOT DESIGNED TO REQUIRE IN THIS OR EVEN TORIES OF INDIVIDUAL PIECES OF EQUIPMENT. USED IN THE REBUILDING EFFORT AND IT IS NOT AT THE OFFICE DATA REAL TIME REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. INSTEAD WE WANT TO KNOW WHETHER THE REBUILD IT JUST. MEANT THAT THE EXACT TYPE OF EQUIPMENT CURRENTLY THERE OR- A REBUILD NEW FIBER NETWORK. YOU SOME PART OF THE AIR OF THE EXTENT SOME PARTS OF THE AREA BEING GIVE DIFFERENT. MAYBE BACK POWER IS BEING. MAYBE NOT. CONSUMERS NEED TO KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT IN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS ESPECIALLY VICTIMS OF NATURAL DISASTERS TRYING. TO REBUILD THEMSELVES. LOOKS ANCHOR INSTITUTION REGULAR ALL NEYMAR KNOWINGLY AROUND PROP WHICH IS KIND OF THE TWO MEN MARK. OKAY LET ME- COVERED SPECIFIC ABOUT THE- FIRST TIME TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE IT DOES. A TECHNICIAN TO RE ON OCT. TO BE. WE BELIEVE THAT IS A CO PART OF THE BILL TO ALLOW LOCAL. FROM THE LATE TO GET TO BE MOVED OFF. ENJOY THE- OTHER POP TO BE- VERY IMPORTANT OF THE BILL. ALL. MISSION I KNOW SOME CONCERN ABOUT COMP. HELPED UP AND TURNS UNDER OF BILL. NOT AT. IMPACT KERN RULE AND- OBLIGATION. ABOUT THE CARE YOU'RE BEING ABLE TO PROTECT WHAT THEY- TO BE. CONFIDENTIAL AND- AT NOT AREN'T FOR THE- CAN BELIEVE THAT THE BILL. SO YOU WANT TO WORK CERTAINLY WITH THE ON THE CARRIER FROM THAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE. MR ARE AND- JUST REMEMBER YOU OF. A RECORD TIME LIMITS. TWO MINUTES PER WITNESS THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIR AND COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS FOR GARCIA I AM THE DISTRICT NINE BIKES PRESIDENT FOR COULD. WORKERS OF A- WE ARE CALL COSTA A BABY HUNDRED. DISTURBING COVERS CAL NEVADA HAWAII IN.

OUR GOAL ADD IT AND BE ENSURE THAT EVERYONE. EVERY PHONE IS UP AND RUN THE SHOW TIME. IN THE MOST OF ME POSSIBLE LONG SERVICE. FIFTEEN TO OFTEN WORKERS AT HER FROM CUTS THAT NOT ONLY WOULD DO SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE BECAUSE OF A MY SO. BUT THE SERVER IS NOT GOING LOCAL LAW PERIODS EVEN WHEN MANY THEM ABLE ARE BACK ONLINE. THE CARD SAID CLAIMED THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT POWER COMPACT. TO KEEP NETWORKS OFF DURING OUTAGES BUT ANY FELL PEOPLE PICKED A CAN. THAT THE FACT FIXES NOT GOING TO.

REPLACING OLD COPPER WITH NICKEL COPPER LEAVING THE NETWORK OUT THERE AND UNDER TO BE TODAY'S THE TOMORROW'S. FROM UNDER HIS MULLIN WASHER THAT THE- OKAY AT COMMUTER NETWORK SHOULD BE WE WITH ROCK CABLE THAT CAUGHT. TO MANY TIMES COMIC. INDUSTRY HAS GROWN LOCAL TO STOP PLEDGES. WE OUGHT TO THE PEOPLE TO. AND ESPECIALLY TO OUR CHILDREN TO LEARN THE LEFT OF THE PAST. AND THE WILD IN STORE BUILDING TO HOLD PROVIDERS TO. THANK YOU TO THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. THANK YOU NOW WE'RE GOING TO BE ON. I MEAN I WITH- OR A ROAST IS IN THE GALLERY REACHED. THIS MEASURE- PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT'S UNNECESSARY REDUNDANT TO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS FOR US TO REPORT NETWORK OUTAGES AND RESTORATION EFFORTS. SO THE PROPONENTS KEEP DISCUSSING ABOUT ISSUES FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE WORLD HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN SIGNIFICANTLY. RT COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES APPROPRIATELY POINTED OUT SOME OF THE RECENT CHANGES. IN TWENTY NINETEEN THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED SB SIX SEVENTY WHICH REQUIRED- COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS. TO NOTIFIED CAL OH YES ABOUT ANY KIND OF NETWORK OUTAGES AND THE RESTORATION EFFORTS AND WE HAD TO MAKE SURE WE KEPT THAT REAL TIME SITUATION. TO PROVIDE LOCAL. ONE HUNDRED A LOCAL LOCAL- PUBLIC SAFETY AGENCIES WITH THE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE PUBLIC WAS SAFE. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT THE- PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION JUST ON FEBRUARY EIGHTEENTH. TWENTY TWENTY ONE THIS YEAR- ADOPTED THEIR NEW RESILIENCY DECISION WHICH REQUIRES THAT COMMUNICATION SERVICE PROVIDERS. AND HIGH FIRE THREAT OF BACKUP POWER. WITHIN EIGHT MONTHS OF THE DECISION SO VERY SHORTLY HERE WE WERE GOING TO HAVE BACK UP POWER AVAIL OUTLETS LOCATIONS AND WITHIN EIGHTEEN MONTHS HAVE THAT AVAILABLE TO THE ENTIRE NETWORK. WITHIN THAT HARPER HIGH FIRE THREAT AREA. IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY ALSO REQUIRE THAT WE KEEP OUR CUSTOMERS AWARE OF ANY OUTAGES. THAT WE KEEP THE PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THE LOCAL FOLKS AWARE OF ANY ALLERGIES AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT AS PART OF THE SIX MONTHS- REQUIREMENT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE A RESILIENCY PLAN. TO THE PC ABOUT WHAT WE DO TO RESTORE OUR NETWORKS SHOULD THERE BE DAMAGE TO THAT TO THOSE FACILITIES. SO WE REALLY FIND THIS- UNNECESSARY IN ADDITION. THE P. YOU SEE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ALSO- CAPABLE OF GETTING NETWORK OUTAGE INFORMATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE NETWORK OUTAGE REPORTING SYSTEM NORRIS IS AVAILABLE TO THE STATE IF THEY KEEP THAT INFORMATION CONFIDENTIAL. AND RECENTLY THE FCC DECIDED TO ALSO SHARE DISASTER INFORMATION REPORTING SYSTEM REPORTS THERE'S REPORTS. THAT AS LONG AS IT KEPT CONFIDENTIAL THAT TALK ABOUT THE RESTORATION EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE SO REALLY THIS THIS BILL IS A DAY LATE AND A DOLLAR SHORT SO- WE WOULD- ORIGINALLY WE WOULD.

MEMBERS ADDRESS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE CALIFORNIA'S THE MORAL IMPERATIVE. AND A MAJOR CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE OF OUR TIME. THESE GLITTERY TECHNOLOGICAL DISPARITY HAVE BONTA FAR TOO LONG. AND WE MUST DO BETTER RIGHT HERE THE TECHNOLOGY CAPITAL OF THE WORLD. IT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE OUR STUDENTS HUDDLED. AT THAT RESTAURANT. LIKE THE PHOTO THE TWO LITTLE GIRLS HERE ANY SALINAS LAPTOP GET THAT WENT VIRAL NATIONALLY. BECAUSE IT WAS THE ONLY PLACE THEY COULD ACT WITH THE INTERNET FOR THEIR CLASSES. BUT THAT IMAGE CAPTURES THE STRUGGLE TO SO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS ACROSS OUR STATE. AND OUR NATION AND LET'S BE HONEST THE INTERNET IS NOT A LUXURY ANYMORE JUST FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT. AT THE NECESSITY OF EVERYDAY IFE AND IT MUST BE VIEWED AS MINISTER UTILITY JUST LIKE WATER ELECTRICITY OR GAS. AND WE KNOW THAT OUR STUDENTS WILL NEED AFFORDABLE HIGH SPEED INTERNET ACTED BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. BUT SO WILL THE PARENT AND STILL WILL SENIOR ACTIVE UNTIL HEALTH AND OTHER SERVICES. IT IS CRITICAL. FOR CALIFORNIANS OF ALL AGES AND BACKGROUNDS. BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE ONLY WAY. FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. RURAL AREA ALONE NEIGHBORHOOD. IT CALIFORNIA'S TRULY GIVE ATTACK THAT THE- AND LOOKS LIKE A BROADBAND. BOND NEXT YEAR. AND WE ARE PROUD TO. THIS RIGHT NOW. THAT COULD APPOINT THE BILLION NEEDED TO COULD BE A THREAT.

I'LL JUST LAY OUT A FEW FACTS. IT AND- HEY YOU ALL KNOW THEY'RE STILL AS MANY AS ONE MILLION CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET IN OUR STATE- THIS MEASURE WOULD PLACE- A BOND MEASURE ON THE BALLOT. THAT WOULD PROVIDE SOME TEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT COULD BE USED TO BUILD THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE PLACES WHERE IT DOESN'T EXIST. TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS BROADBAND IN OUR STATE OF FOR THIS. BILL TODAY IS SIMPLY A VOTE TO GIVE THE VOTERS A CHANCE TO DECIDE IF IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THEY SHOULD PASS. THIS BOND- COULD BE AVAILABLE TO MUNICIPALITIES AND TWO SCHOOLS AND OTHERS ARE TO EXPAND BROADBAND IN AND I MIND YOU WITH THAT TO SUPPORT. THE NEEDS OF PUBLIC SAFETY OF FOLKS WHO ARE OFTEN INCORRECT RESPONDENTS WHO WERE OFTEN WITHOUT BROADBAND THIS PANDEMIC HAS UNCOVERED JUST THAT GAP IN THE WITH OF THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN THIS STATE AND IN THIS COUNTRY SO MANY STUDENTS WERE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE FULLY. IN IN DISTANCE LEARNING MANY CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES WERE UNABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN TELEHEALTH. MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE TOOLS TO BE CONNECTED DESPITE THE EFFORTS OF MY OFFICE THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND SO MANY IMPLANTS. WE WORK TOGETHER TO GET DONATIONS FOR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF HOT SPOTS IN COMPUTING DEVICES IT JUST IS NOT ENOUGH WE NEED MORE WHICH IS WHY WE HAVE AB THIRTY FOUR IN FRONT OF US.

AT THE CCPA MEMBERS SUPPORT THE OPTIONS TO CALL ELEVEN SHARING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET HOWEVER THE CTA OPPOSES AB THIRTY FOUR UNLESS IT IS AMENDED. TO AVOID THE USE OF BOND FUNDS TO OVER BUILD EXISTING BROADBAND NETWORKS BUILT WITH PRIVATE INVESTMENT THAT ARE FULLY CAPABLE OF PROVIDING BROADBAND INTERNET SERVICE. IN ADDITION THE BILL FAILS TO INCLUDE GUARANTEE THAT CALIFORNIANS UNSERVED HOUSEHOLDS. WILL RECEIVE ANY BROADBAND SERVICE. THE BILL WITHOUT THE- A WAR OF GRAY TO ELIGIBLE INTO TEACH FOR PROJECTS THAT DEPLOY BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AND BROADBAND SERVICES BUT HAD NOOVERALL REQUIREMENT THAT THE GRANT FUNDED INFRASTRUCTURE IN UNSERVED AREAS. SEVERAL PROVISIONS WOULD CREATE A CONFLICTING SCHEME OF PREFERENCES DEMOCRATIC SIDE OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. BUT THESE TERMS ARE NOT CLEARLY DEFINED THE RESULT IS THAT THE BILL WOULD CREATE THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT USE OF BOB SIGNS TO OVER BUILD EXISTING BROADBAND NETWORKS BUILT WITH PRIVATE INVESTMENT WITH NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPLETELY ANSWERED. REMOTE AREAS. OF CALIFORNIA WILL BENEFIT. EIGHT THIRTY FOUR WHATEVER VOTERS APPROVE. TAKING ON A NEW TEN BILLION DOLLAR LONG TERM DEBT FOR BROADBAND WHEN CALIFORNIA HAS NEWLY AVAILABLE FEDERAL FUNDS FOR BROADBAND AND RECORD STATE INCOME TAX RECEIPTS CREATING A STATE BUDGET SURPLUS. THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN RECENTLY SIGNED BY PRESIDENT BIDEN PROVIDES TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLION TO STATE SEVEN HUNDRED AND THIRTY BILLION FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR USES THAT INCLUDE INVESTMENT IN BROADBAND.

ASSOCIATION A REPRESENTATIVE. THAT THAT EVEN THE- FOR PROFIT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS HAVE INDICATED TO. ME THAT IT DOESN'T YOU KNOW THE MARKET DOESN'T PENCIL OUT TO FOR THEM TO EXTEND THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE RURAL PARTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO THAT'S WHY. IT'S INCUMBENT ON US YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE INVESTING IN THAT BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT WE ARE EXTENDING IT TO YOUR DISTRICT. I MEAN THEY GOT I TOLD SAID THE JOINT AUTHORS AND THAT THE GOAL OF THIS BILL IS TO GET. YOU KNOW MORE THESE BROADBAND. INFRASTRUCTURE BEING BUILT IN DISTRICTS LIKE YEARS OR MR SANTIAGO IS OR R.

I DON'T TAKE A LONG TIME BUT THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THAT I HAVE TO FAMILY SAID THAT IF THERE'S- ONE THING THAT WE FOUND IN COMMON ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA THIS PANDEMIC HIT. IS HOW INTERCONNECTED WE WERE- WHEN IT CAME TO THE ISSUE OF- NOT HAVING ADEQUATE CONNECTION. AND YOUR MAY SURPRISE FOLKS DIDN'T URBAN AREA LIKE MYSELF WE FOUND OURSELVES- WITH THIS EXTREME DESPAIR- I DO NOT HAVE ADEQUATE CONNECTION. EITHER SPIEGEL FOR AFFORDABILITY- AND WE FOUND OUT THAT THE INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HAD OR OR THE CONNECTIONS THAT WE HAD SIMPLY JUST DIDN'T WORK OUT. NOT WE KNOW ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WHEN IT CAME TO EDUCATION. BUT IN THE SHADOWS- THEY WERE THERE ARE MANY LAYERS OF NEED THAT HAPPENED SOMETHING SO BASIC. AND WE FOUND THIS FIRST ALBUM CALLED IT HIT IT TOOK A CRISIS. FOR THIS TO BECOMES. SO MUCH MORE CRITICAL AND IMPORTANT FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT. WE NOW HAVE BEEN A LOT MORE IN COMMON WITH RURAL AREAS WHEN IT COMES TO TELEHEALTH. THE INABILITY DURING A PANDEMIC. FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR TAKE TO GET ON A BUS. FOR TWO TO THREE HOURS TO VISIT A DOCTOR PUT OURSELVES LITERALLY. IN HARM'S WAY OR DEATHS WAY- JUST WASN'T AVAILABLE TO LOTS OF COMMUNITIES. AND WE THE PANDEMIC FIRST HIT AND WE BEGAN TO TALK TO CLINICS TO SHIFT. THE GET CLINICS THE AVAILABILITY TO CONNECT WITH OUR CONSUMERS. WAS NOT MET ON THE OTHER SIDE WITH FOLKS WHO HAD NO CONNECTIVITY- THE- HUGE EFFORT FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO HAND OUT HOT SPOTS WELL WE SHOULD HAVE HAD THE ABILITY TO JUST CLICK A SWITCHING CONNECT. THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD BUT MILLIONS OF STUDENTS ACROSS STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT'LL I CAN'T SAY ENOUGH OF HOW DEVASTATING. IT WAS THE WAKE UP. DURING A DURING A- COLBY CRISIS ONLY TO FIND OUT. THAT GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN WILL BE LEFT BEHIND FAMILIES WILL BE LEFT BEHIND THAT THE INTERNET ACCESS THAT WE HAD AT HOME WAS INADEQUATE FOR TWO TO THREE- COMPUTER STREAMING AT THE SAME TIME THE KIDS WERE NOT ABLE TO LEARN IT WAS HEARTBREAKING TO SEE. IN A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY AND THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. KIDS SITTING OUTSIDE. OF TACO BELL I BELIEVE THE WITH THE WITH ALL THIS ALL OVER NEIGHBORHOODS. WE SAW THAT THE STARBUCKS WE THOUGHT OF THE MCDONALD'S WE THOUGHT. PEOPLE COULD AFFORD INTERNET IN WHEN YOU HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION. ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY OF THE CONNECTION OF INTERNET. OR THE ABILITY TO PAY YOUR RENT PAY YOUR BILLS. AND WE WOULD WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO RESPOND IN THE BIGGEST WAY POSSIBLE IN THE- IN A IN A BOLD% MANNER- SO I'M ENCOURAGED BY THIS CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD. I'M DISAPPOINTED THAT IT'S TAKEN US A PANDEMIC IN A CRISIS TO. FINALLY RAISE IT UP. BUT I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP NONE THE LESS. BOB THIS CONVERSATION AND GET YET LAST YEAR WHEN IT WOULD YOU KNOW WHAT MAYBE WASN'T MET WITH OPEN ARMS ACROSS. ALL SPECTRUMS WITH THIS YEAR- I THINK OF THE YEAR TO DO IT BECAUSE- THERE IS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT. WE'VE ALL FELT IT I TOLD YOU THE STORY AND YOU GUYS OF ALL HEARD I CAN'T CALL ANYBODY BACK TO BE CALLED ME WHILE I'M ON THE FLY BECAUSE- I GOT ONE HOUR SIX HOURS DRIVE TO CONNECT. AND IT'S NOT EVEN A GREAT CAN IMAGINE LIVING LIKE THAT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE AND SITE. MY HEART GOES OUT TO ALL OF YOU WHO ARE IN RURAL AREAS. OR ALONG THE REGION'S THE CALIFORNIA THAT I DRIVE TO. DURING MY DRIVE HOME. SO WITH THAT IN MIND. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO DO THIS. I TO GET IT RIGHT TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION AND- LET LET THE VOTERS HEARTS LANDING- WHERE THE WHERE THEY WILL BECAUSE WE KNOW IT HAD THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE WITH US. ON THIS SO- I THANK YOU- TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM- TORRANCE AND MICHAEL IF YOU COULD TELL OF VALLEY FOR HELPING TO LEAD THIS IS A PROJECT TO HELP ALONG THE WAY AND- NOT HEADED BACK TO YOU FOR YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS AND I BELIEVE A- I GOT IT WRONG IT WASN'T AT THE BEGINNING OF THE AND YOU WERE GOING TO HELP CLOSE ON POLITICS. JERRY BOB. DAHLE BUT THERE'S BEEN TO WORK WHAT ONE THIRTEEN YOU MIGHT. ALL OF THE PREVIOUS CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO THE REALLY RECOGNIZED LEAD AUTHOR AND- HIS TEAM. FOR TRULY WHAT HAS BEEN A VERY OPEN AND COLLABORATIVE EFFORT AMONG OUR OFFICES ARE TO BRING THIS A VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF POLICY FORWARD. IT'S EXCITING IT'S EXCITING TO SEE THE LEVEL OF POTENTIAL INVESTMENT THAT GOING TO CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESSING THE MANY ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN TO DATE DURING THIS PANDEMIC BUT THAT WE'VE KNOWN PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- AS IT RELATES TO CONNECTING UNDER SERVED COMMUNITIES AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES NOT STATE. AND THEIR DIVERSE NEEDS. WE THINK TODAY OF THE STUDENTS WOULD THINK TODAY OF THE TELEHEALTH ASPECTS WE THINK TODAY OF THE PANDEMIC IN THE NEED TO BE CONNECTED FOR THE VACCINE AND PRIOR TO THAT TO IDENTIFY. TEST SITES RECORDED NINETEEN BUT YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THOSE CHALLENGES WE ALSO YOU KNOW I THINK OF. UNDER LOOK THE IDEA HOW IMPORTANT THIS IS TO THE GROWTH OF CALIFORNIA'S ECONOMY OUR SMALL BUSINESSES WITHOUT INTERNET ARE NO. SMALL BUSINESSES IN TODAY'S WORLD- THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT IN ORDER TO ATTRACT. LARGER BUSINESSES TO PARTS OF THE STATE THE NEED THE ECONOMIC INVESTMENT YOU NEED THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND IT IS IT JUST WATER SEWER ROADS TODAY IT'S BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL THEY THINK THAT'S WHY THERE'S SUCH A STRONG EMPHASIS ON. THE AREA OF UNSERVED RURAL PARTS OF CALIFORNIA AND I JUST WANT TO- CONFIRM AS A AS A- THAT THEY AUTHORED THE LEAD AUTHOR HAS SET THIS AS HE SAID TODAY THE IDEA YEARS TO CONNECT PLACES. DRAW CALIFORNIA NOT LIKE THE ONES IN HIS DISTRICT BUT THE ONES IN MANY OTHER INDIVIDUALS DISTRICTS AND I AND I APPRECIATE THE SELFISHNESS THAT T. PRESENTS- WHEN PUSHING THIS PUBLIC POLICY- FORWARD SO FOR ME IT'S WITH GREAT HONOR THAT WERE ABLE TO TURN OUT THAT THIS BILL AND- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT COULD REALLY TRANSFORM- THE FUTURE OF. INDIA AND I MENTIONED TO CELLO ARE BUT THE FUTURE ARE DIFFERENT I THINK WE'RE ABLE TO- REALLY GET AHEAD OF THEM- BY MAKING SURE THAT THE INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN PLACE TO WITH THAT TAX PROFITS BONTA THE BILL DICKENS JEFF ALARM IS A FEW WORDS. IF THE COMMITTEE WILL INDULGE ME ONLY BECAUSE WE HAD MEMBERS COME IN AND I'LL- IF YOU WOULD BE BRIEF BECAUSE WERE A CLOSING COMMENT. THE NO QUESTIONS WE ALREADY WENT TO QUESTIONS SORRY NOT A GREAT BUT- AGREEMENT IF YOU WANT TO BE A BRIEF ONE ALLEN TOLD YEAH. I JUST- AND I'M SORRY THAT I CAME INTO COMMITTEES AT THE SAME TIME. IF THE AUTHOR COULD GO THROUGH. YOUR BILL CREATES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FUNDING FOR MUNICIPAL BROADBAND. AND ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE REPRESENTING SMALLER CITIES. IS HOW ARE THEY GOING TO DO THAT BROADBAND IS ACTUALLY VERY EXPENSIVE TO DO. THAT HAS A VERY HIGH OVERHEAD COSTS. IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN. THE SECOND QUESTION A MAYBE IT WAS ALREADY COVERED IT HAS TO DO WITH. THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS COMING IN AND WHY THE BOND IS NECESSARY NOW IF YOU'VE ALREADY COVERED IT. THAT'S FINE BUT IF YOU CAN ANSWER THAT THANK YOU YOU CAN COVER THEM IN YOUR CLOSING. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK- LIMIT LET ME ADDRESS THE- THE CONCERNS FOR THE OR THE QUESTIONS REYES FIRST AND THEN I'LL- A TRANSITION IN THE CLOSING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR YOUR QUESTIONS- THE- THE FIRST QUESTION AS TO THE MUNICIPAL BROADBAND- THERE ARE NUMEROUS CITIES SCHOOL DISTRICTS- THROUGHOUT STATE LIKE FOR EXAMPLE- MR GARCIA HIS IMPERIAL COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION- HAVE LAUNCHED A PUBLIC BROADBAND NETWORK TO HELP CLOSE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IN HIS DISTRICT IN IN MY DISTRICT THERE IS A- JOINT POWERS JOINT POWER AUTHORITY THAT WAS FORMED BY A GROUP OF SMALL SUBURBAN BELIEVE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER HARBATH- THAT- THAT THAT COMBINED THEIR THEIR- RESOURCES TO- AND PROVIDE THAT- THAT- CRITICAL MASS NECESSARY NOR DOES SUPPORT. A MUNICIPAL BROADBAND NETWORK- WEEK OURS IS CALLED AT THE SOUTH BAY FIBER NETWORK IT'S PROVIDING- A FIBRE BROADBAND FIBRE BACKBONE- TO CONNECT FIFTEEN CITIES THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW THE MORE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE INTERNET SERVICES FOR THEIR PUBLIC SERVICES FOR THEIR CITIES FOR THEIR FAULT THEIR FIRST RESPONDERS- YEAH. THE HOPE IS TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND IT- YOU KNOW THROUGH THEIR THER PARKS TO PROVIDE HOT SPOTS FOR- FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE INTERNET AND I SAID SO THIS BOND IS SPECIFICALLY- TALKS ABOUT. THE REQUIREMENTS THEY THEY NEED TO- APPLICANTS FOR THESE GRANTS FOR MUNICIPAL BOND- MINUTES FOR BROADBAND GRANTS AND NEED TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO- MAINTAIN THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS NO TO BE ABLE TO- PROVIDE THE SERVICE- IF THEY- IF YOU KNOW IF THEY WANT TO GO BEYOND JUST LAYING THE BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THIS- IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS I WANT TO AND PLUS. OF SAYS THAT- IN A WE EARLIER THAT THE SO SHE SHOULD. EXPRESSING THE CONCERNS BUT THIS THIS CAN CREATE YOU KNOW NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS ARE RAISED ABOUT THE COSTS OF- PROVIDING SERVICE THE COST OF MAINTENANCE. AND SAID THAT- IS SPELLED OUT IN IN THIS BILL ALSO IS GIVING PREFERENCE TO GRANT APPLICANTS THAT COULD DEMONSTRATE THAT CAN ADDRESS THOSE THOSE ISSUES. LAST BUT NOT LEAST YOUR YOUR- RAISING THE POINT ABOUT FEDERAL FUNDS- YOU KNOW I THINK OF. I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO MY CONGRESS CONGRESSMAN LAST WEEK- CONGRESSMAN TED LIEU. AND AND HE HE MADE IT CLEAR TO ME THAT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN- DOLLARS OF DEBT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WOULD BE IN A STRONGER POSITION TO ACCESS MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS. IF WE CAN PROVIDE MATCHING STATE DOLLARS WE'VE THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE MORE THE- THE FEDERAL DOLLARS. BYE BYE BEING ABLE TO- YOU KNOW BEING IN THE POSITION TO BE ABLE TO OFFER MORE STATE DOLLARS SO. THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO- LEVERAGE- AND THE BILL AGAIN CLEARLY GIVES PREFERENCE TO APPLICANTS. THAT CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY CAN LEVERAGE- THE- THE STATE BROADBAND FUNDS- WITH. LOCAL FEDERAL PRIVATE AND ANY OTHER DOLLARS THAT THEY CAN COMBINE TO TWO OF A BILL THIS BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE SO- I THINK IN AN ENCLOSING- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY. TO TAKE A CRISIS OF THIS PANDEMIC AND TURN IT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE ABLE TO. YOU KNOW GO BIG AND BOLD- AND INVESTING IN THE PUBLIC BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. TO BE ABLE TO DRAW INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO PARTNER WITH- WITH THE- THE PRIVATE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS AND OTHER ACTORS IN IN THIS INDUSTRY- AND SO- WITH THAT- MISTER CHAIRMAN. HI I WANT TO THANK YOU AGAIN- WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO. GET TO THIS POINT WITHOUT YOUR LEADERSHIP- WITHOUT YEAR- STAFF- ADMINS YOU KNOW WHO I KNOW RECENTLY LEFT THE COMMITTEE HAS WORKED SO HARD ON THIS BILL AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE. AS EFFORTS OF PEAS- HAPPENS TO BE TUNING INTO THIS BROADCAST AND I KNOW THAT- WE ALL KNOW THAT MR GARCIA. HAS BEEN- YOU KNOW WORKING FOR YEARS ON ON ON. FOR AND EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WITH HIS- HIS EARLIER BILL- TO PROVIDE INTERNET FOR ALL- SO YOU KNOW WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP MR CHAIRMAN WORK YOU'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE- PRIORITIZING THE LOW INCOME URBAN COMMUNITIES. WITH MR GARCIA'S LEADERSHIP WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE PRIORITIZING THE RULE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO WITH ALL THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU. AND I BELIEVE WE ARE THE FIRST IN THE SECOND- TESTAMENTUM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTION IS DO PASTA COMMITTEE ON PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION. SANTIAGO SANTIAGO HI PATTERSON BOERNER HORVATH. BONTA CERVANTES. SEVEN TO SIGN DAVIES. DAVID SIGN EDUARDO GARCIA EDUARDO GARCIA I HOLDEN LOW. LOW I COOK SILVA. RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ HIGH MATHIS. MATHIS I COULD DEAL CARILLO I. EIGHT TWO ZERO EMISSIONS OUT. EIGHT ZERO MEASURES NOT CONGRADULATIONS. I BELIEVE WE HAVE MISTRAL. KAREN. MOVE ON TO MISTER WOULD AB FORTY ONE. AND. YEAH BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE DEPLOYMENT. THIS WILL IF YOU WILL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THIS COMMITTEE IS WELL AWARE OF THE MYRIAD OF WAYS IN WHICH THE DIGITAL DIVIDE HAS EXACERBATED THE CHALLENGES OF THE PAST YEAR. THE SOLUTIONS I PUT FORWARD IN AB FORTY ONE OR NOT A SILVER BULLET. BUT THEY ARE IMPORTANT STEPS AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO BRING CALIFORNIA'S DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. SINCE TAKING OFFICE COMMONSENSE EXPANSION OF RURAL BROADBAND ACCESS HAS BEEN A PRIORITY OF MINE. THE CONCEPT OF DIG ONCE IS NOT A NEW POLICY AREA FOR ME I'M BRINGING THIS CONCEPT BEFORE YOU AGAIN. BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR STATE AGENCIES DO NOT RECOGNIZE THE URGENCY WITH WHICH WE MUST ROLL OUT CRITICAL BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE FEDERAL HIGHWAY IN ADMINISTRATION. NO TO TAKING ADVANTAGE OF DIG ONCE OPPORTUNITIES CUTS THE COST OF BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT BY NINETY PERCENT. WE CANNOT AFFORD TO LET THESE OPPORTUNITIES GO BY. PUT SIMPLY AS WE UPGRADE OUR STATE ROADWAYS WE NEED TO DETERMINE HOW NOT IF BROADBAND IS A PART OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS. THEY WERE GOING TO INVEST SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC DOLLARS IN CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS TO BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE. WE NEED TO ASK A LITTLE MORE OF OUR PARTNERS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR. THERE ARE INSTANCES MY DISTRICT WHERE BUSINESSES ARE INDIVIDUALS HAVE PAID IN THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS TO BRING BROADBAND SERVICE TO THEIR HOME OR BUSINESS. WE HAD HOPED THAT NARROW EXTENSIONS WOULD PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES TO CONNECT OTHERS ALONG THE WAY OR MORE INTO MORE INDIVIDUALS NEAR THE DESK THE DESTINATION. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE. COMMUNITIES ARE BEING PASSED OVER NOT BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PROFITABLE BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT PROFITABLE ENOUGH. JUST LIKE WE CAN UPGRADE OUR STATE ROADWAYS WITHOUT CONSIDERING DEMAND FOR DATA WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO MISS OPPORTUNITIES TO CONNECT COMMUNITIES WHEN PRIVATELY FUNDED PROJECTS BRING INFRASTRUCTURE TO NEW AREAS. ONE ENTITY PAIN STAGGERING SUMS TO GET CONNECTED IS NOT WHAT THE DEBT MARKET DICTATES IT'S BROADBAND GERRYMANDERING. THE EXISTING LINE EXTENSION PROGRAM OFFERED TO THE C. P. U. C. IS NOT ENOUGH AND I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE UNDER UTILIZED MARKETS IN MY DISTRICT IN IN THE STATE. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS A SOME OPPOSITION FROM THE CABLE INDUSTRY ON A ON THIS ASPECT OF MY BILL. I HOPE THEY RECOGNIZE THIS FRUSTRATION THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM MY CONSTITUENTS. I THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO SERVE MORE CUSTOMERS WE NEED TO DO BETTER. ON THE PHONE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS CALVIN STANDING WITH THE COUNTY OF CINEMAS ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD. I LOOK FOR TO SOLUTION THAT SERIOUSLY CONSIDERS EACH POTENTIAL CUSTOMER FOR THIS VITAL RESOURCE. EVERY TIME A SHOVEL BREAKS GROUND. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. I THINK YOU MISTER WOULD- WE HAVE TWO WITNESSES- IN SUPPORT OF IS- MR CELINE SENDING APOLOGIZES AND IN OPPOSITION WOULD BE MR OROZCO WHO WOULD BE A PERSON- WE'RE RECOMMENDING TWO MINUTES. AND MISTER SANDY YOU MAY BEGIN IT'S SUPPORT. YOU CHAIR NUMBERS NINE ALBUMS IN THE I'M BROADBAND ANALYST BUT THE CINEMA COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD. I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING THE TIME TO HEAR ABOUT THE ISSUES EXPERIENCED DELIVERING BROADBAND IN RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES. BROADBAND CHALLENGES ARE DIFFERENT IN ALL AREAS BUT IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE ARE INCLUSIVE AND EQUITABLE CONNECT ALL COMMUNITIES BUT CONTRIBUTE INTERNAL ECONOMY. CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND FOR INTERNET ACCESS INCREASES EVERY DAY QUITE SIMPLY CONSIDERED DATE WHERE YOU LEAVE YOUR SMARTPHONE SMARTPHONE AT HOME AND HOW THAT AFFECTS YOUR DAILY ROUTINE. CALIFORNIANS ARE DEPENDENT ON BROADBAND IN ORDER TO CONTRIBUTE TOWARDS THE ECONOMY COLLECTIVELY AND IT IS ABOUT THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE EVERYONE HAS ACCESS. AB FORTY ONE RECOGNIZES BUT TO GET CALIFORNIA CONNECTED WE REQUIRE BUY IN FROM BOTH THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTOR. BIG ONES POLICIES ARE IMPORTANT TO BOTH URBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES. WE CANNOT SIT BACK AND EXPECT BROADBAND TECHNOLOGY TO GET INCLUDED IN THESE CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. YOU MUST BE PROACTIVE TO ENSURE COORDINATION OF BROADBAND INCLUSION BUT ALSO MAYBE FORGOTTEN ALWAYS CRITICAL RESOURCES AND TIME LIKE WE HAVE SEEN HISTORICALLY. WE ALSO HOPE THAT YOU WILL HEAR DR WORDS APPEALS FOR INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN DISCLOSURES AND SERVICE TERRITORIES. WE HAVE EXPERIENCED MAJOR OBSTACLE TO TRACK THE INVESTMENT IN TORY KANEMI. INACCURATE DATA GAPS IN TRANSPARENCY AND COORDINATION WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULT IN OUTCOMES THAT ARE MORE EXPENSIVE. SONOMA COUNTY ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON IMPROVING TRANSPARENCY BY CROWDSOURCING GRANULAR HOUSEHOLD DATA ILLUSTRATE WHAT ACTUAL CONNECTIVITY LOOKS LIKE IN OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT REGION. IN ADDITION WE ARE EXPLORING THE CREATION OF A PUBLICLY GOVERNED BROADBAND INFRASTRUCTURE ENTITY TO INCREASE EFFECTIVE AND EQUITABLE BROADBAND EXPANSION REGIONALLY. BUT OUR REGION AND MANY OTHERS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND I BELIEVE APPROVING AB FORTY ONE IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO SOLVE THE DIGITAL BOOK DIVIDE TOGETHER. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. FIRST ONE UNDER TWO MINUTES. I WANT TO GO AHEAD AND- NOW INVITE. MISTER RUSSELL IS IN PERSON THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BERNIE OROZCO WITH A CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION- CCPA WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED SO THERE'S REALLY TWO BILLS HERE- THE FIRST ONE IS DEALING WITH CALTRANS AND- INSTALLING CONDUIT IN THE RIGHT AWAY WE ACTUALLY ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THAT AND WE APPRECIATE YOUR OF THE YEARS. SOME IN THE WOODS ATTEMPTS TO HELP REDUCE BARRIERS TO BROADBAND DEPLOYMENT- WITH THIS PARTICULAR ONE WE WOULD JUST SUGGEST SOME MINOR EDITS OR SOME AMENDMENTS. THAT WOULD MAKE THIS TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL RIGHT NOW IT'S ONLY FOR FIBER WE ALSO HAVE CO AXLE FACILITIES THAT WE DEPLOY SO A TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL AMENDMENT WOULD BE A GREAT AND ALSO. TO ENSURE THAT IT'S EQUAL ACCESS FOR ALL PROVIDERS WOULD BE THE FIRST- REQUEST THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE SECOND PORTION OF THE BILL DEALS WITH DISCLOSING PRIVATE CONTRACTUAL INFORMATION THAT IN I. S. B. WOULD HAVE WITHIN INDIVIDUAL PARTY- THAT IS CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION AND IT IS PART OF THE HOMELAND SECURITY CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE. DEPLOYMENT LIMITATIONS SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE FIRST PORTION OF THE BILL BE ELIMINATED BUT WE WOULD STRONGLY SUGGEST THAT THE AUTHOR CONSIDER MAKING IMPROVEMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSIONS- LINE EXTENSION PROGRAM. WHICH I WAS PART OF THE AB SIXTEEN SIXTY FIVE FOR TWENTY SEVENTEEN THAT WAS AUTHORIZED BY THIS COMMITTEE. THE LEGISLATION IS TO HELP THOSE PROPERTIES THAT ARE JUST ADJACENT TO SERVICE AREAS. AND THAT WE CAN GET THEM SERVE- AMAZINGLY SINCE THAT WAS ADOPTED BACK IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE PC HAS ONLY AWARDED ONE GRANTS- AND THE ONLY AWARD ONE GRANDPA BECAUSE THEY LIMITED TO JUST LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. BUT JUST THIS MORNING WE HEARD THAT THERE ARE TWO NEW PENDING APPLICATIONS. AND MISTER WOULD YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO LEARN THAT ONE OF THOSE APPLICATION IS IN YOUR DISTRICT IN THE CITY OF OCCIDENTAL- THAT ONE HOUSEHOLD IT WILL BE CONNECTED WITH FIBER. AT FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS ONE THAT IS PENDING RIGHT NOW THE SECOND PROPOSAL IS FOR FARMWORKER HOUSING. IN SALINAS- THAT WOULD CONNECT- SIXTY SIX HOUSEHOLDS ON A FARM WORKER- PROPERTY. AT ROUGHLY THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF THE LIGHTEST ENGINE PROGRAMCAN WORK I THINK THE AUTHORED MAY WANT TO CONSIDER. MAKES CHANGES TO THE COMMISSION ON THAT PROGRAM BUT RIGHT NOW WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR RECORDS. I NEVER GONNA CONTINUE WITH- AND I'LL ASK IF THERE'S ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WITNESSES AND THE CHAMBER AT THIS POINT I WOULD ONLY ASK FOR NAME ORGANIZATION AND POSITION. I AM C. NON MOVE OVER TO ANY ADDITIONAL SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION WITNESSES. AND THE REMOTES- STATION TESTIMONY STATION. NONE THAT I'M AWARE OF ANY ADDITIONAL ON SUPPORT OPPOSITION WITNESSES ON THE PHONE AGAIN MAIN ORGANIZATION AND POSITION ONLY. Q.

B. H. THANK YOU. ASSEMBLY MEMBER T. V. H. THE FIRST THE SECOND. AND IF YOU WERE TO CLOSE MISTER WHAT'S ONE LOOKS ONE SAY THAT I THINK MR I CAN'T SPEAK FOR THE OTHER BUT THE IS VERY CLEAR ABOUT HIS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT GETS RIGHT BOTH WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED SO WE THANK YOU FOR THAT MISTER- WOULD. AND WOULD ALLOW YOU CLOSING IF YOU WILL THANK YOU- I AM INDEED ALWAYS% OPEN WITH OPPOSITION TO TRY TO CREATE THE BEST POSSIBLE OUTCOME FOR A BILL- WE'VE HEARD THE DISCLOSING OF CONTRACTUAL INFORMATION AS A HOMELAND SECURITY ISSUE FOR YEARS- WHAT I REALLY WANT TO HAPPEN HERE IS THAT IF SOMEBODY AT THE FAR END OF THE ROAD. PUTS IN A SPENDS MONEY WITH THE CABLE COMMUNICATIONS FOLKS TO PUT IN A BROADBAND NETWORK. THAT EVERYBODY ALONG THE ROAD GETS A SHOT AT BEING ABLE TO ADD ON. NOW THE LINE EXTENSION PROGRAM THAT WAS TALKED ABOUT IT ISN'T WORKING. IT'S REALLY NOT WORKING AND SO. THAT'S WHAT I MEANT BY IT'S PROFITABLE BUT NOT PROFITABLE ENOUGH SOMETIMES IT'S LIKE CAN WE NOT AGREE THAT IT MIGHT BE A SENSE THAT THAT SOMEBODY DID EVERYBODY ALONG THE ROAD TO GET ACCESS TO A FIBER THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING RUN OUT THERE FOR SOMEBODY- I THINK IT IS AND I HOPE THAT THE I HOPE THE INDUSTRY CAN WHO CAN FIND THEIR WAY TO BE ABLE SUPPORT OF WITHOUT. THE GUARDS THE OTHER WE NEED INFORMATION WE NEED TO BE WE NEED REAL INFORMATION ABOUT WHERE THINGS WERE BROADBAND IS BEING DEPLOYED AND- WHERE IT STILL NEEDS TO BE DEPLOYED AND WHERE OUR OPPORTUNITIES ARE AND WE DON'T GET THAT FROM THE INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL GARDEN CLOAKED IN AND THAT'S THAT'S UNFORTUNATE- YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THAT. THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE OF INSTANCES WHERE THE LINE EXTENSION PROGRAM MAY BE WORKING BUT THIS START IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND WE'VE GOT THREE NOW I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL THAT A PROFOUND SUCCESS FOR CONSUMERS OUT THERE SO MY HOPE IS THAT THE INDUSTRY WILL WORK WITH US- THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE OUT THERE- THERE'S ALSO PEOPLE WHO WANT TO BE SERVED AND I THINK WE'RE MISSING THE BOAT BY NOT OFFERING IT ALONG THE WAY. WE'RE ALSO DEFINITELY NOT MEANT MISSING THE BOAT WHEN WE DON'T ALLOW THE DIG ONCE POLICY AND WHEN OUR OWN STATE AGENCIES CAN'T GET OUT OF THE WAY AND HELP HELP US TO GET THAT DONE SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. THANK YOU- AND SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. MOTIONS TO PASTA COMMITTEE ON TRANSPORTATION SANTIAGO HI SANTIAGO I PATTERSON. BOERNER HORVATH BOERNER HORVATH I BONTA CERVANTES.

THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN WITH THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE ON THIS BILL BUT THE FACT IS MEMBERS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR ROLE IN OUR DISADVANTAGED AREAS IS WE'VE HEARD FROM OTHER. AUTHORS TODAY. THAT THESE AREAS ARE OFTEN FORGOTTEN THIS ISN'T ABOUT GIVEN A MEGA CHURCH OR DIOCESE THE ABILITY TO TAKE STATE FUNDING TO BOOST SOMETHING HAT THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO WHAT THIS IS ABOUT IS WE HAVE THESE AREAS THE SMALL POCKETS IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE THE ONLY COMMUNITY CENTER THAT IS THERE. IS VERY RELIGIOUS INSTITUTION IT'S THAT SMALL COMMUNITY CHURCH WHERE KIDS GO AFTER SCHOOL TO DO THEIR HOMEWORK BUT THEY DON'T HAVE INTERNET THEY DON'T HAVE BROADBAND. SO IT'S MAKING SURE THAT THOSE VERY VERY SMALL FEW PLACES. CAN GET THE ABILITY TO USE THESE FUNDS SO THAT WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES THOSE FORGOTTEN COMMUNITIES ACROSS OUR STATE. CAN GET ACCESS. WITH THAT I'M OPEN TO ANY QUESTIONS FOR MANY MEMBERS BUT I WANT TO JUST BE VERY SPECIFIC THAT IT'S NOT ABOUT. BIG MEGA CHURCHES GETTING STATE. TAX DOLLARS THIS IS ABOUT THESE TINY TINY LITTLE COMMUNITY CENTERS. THEY JUST HAPPEN TO BE CHURCHES.
