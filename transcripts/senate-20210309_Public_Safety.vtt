YOU HAVE THE STATS ON. THE.

00:15:04.937 --> 00:15:09.108
EITHER THE LIKELIHOOD OF DYING

00:15:09.174 --> 00:15:10.309
AT THE HANDS OF AN INTIMATE

00:15:10.376 --> 00:15:12.878
PARTNER FOR IT OR SOME OTHER

00:15:12.945 --> 00:15:16.048
STATS THAT WOULD INDICATE WHY

00:15:16.115 --> 00:15:19.385
IT IS SO ESSENTIAL TO- TO MAKE

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:20.919
SURE THAT FIREARMS ARE

00:15:20.986 --> 00:15:25.090
RETRIEVED FROM THESE A DOMESTIC

00:15:25.157 --> 00:15:27.192
VIOLENCE- I DON'T HAVE THE

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:28.594
OVERALL STASHED WE KNOW IF

00:15:28.661 --> 00:15:30.396
THERE'S A GUN IN THE HOUSE IT

00:15:30.462 --> 00:15:34.967
INCREASES THE CHANCE BY 5100%

00:15:35.034 --> 00:15:36.869
BY 10% IF A GUN IS IT BUT FOR

00:15:36.935 --> 00:15:39.838
THE FOR THE- THE PERSON WHO HAS

00:15:39.905 --> 00:15:40.539
THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ASSAULT

00:15:40.606 --> 00:15:43.208
AT. RESTRAINING ORDER BUT THAT

00:15:43.275 --> 00:15:44.343
ALSO DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

00:15:44.410 --> 00:15:45.944
THE OTHER PEOPLE WHO OFTENTIMES

00:15:46.011 --> 00:15:46.912
ARE HARMED BY THESE WEAPONS

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:48.847
STAYING IN THE HANDS WE HAD AN-

00:15:48.914 --> 00:15:50.482
EXAMPLE OF THAT. TWO YEARS AGO

00:15:50.549 --> 00:15:52.384
IN SACRAMENTO WHEN SOMEBODY HAD

00:15:52.451 --> 00:15:53.652
A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE RESTRAINING

00:15:53.719 --> 00:15:54.553
ORDER THEY WERE ON THE

00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:56.188
PROHIBITED PERSONS LAST WHEN

00:15:56.255 --> 00:15:58.624
THE POLICE SHOWED UP AN OFFICER

00:15:58.691 --> 00:15:59.191
WAS SHOT AND KILLED AT THAT

00:15:59.258 --> 00:16:02.461
TIME- I DON'T HAVE THE-

00:16:02.528 --> 00:16:03.829

FRONT OF ME BUT- IT'S ACTUALLY.

00:16:07.866 --> 00:16:10.102
ARE QUITE SIGNIFICANT-

00:16:10.169 --> 00:16:13.405
ESPECIALLY AMONGST WOMEN- OF.

00:16:13.472 --> 00:16:18.043
THE WOMAN'S. DEATH IS. IT LIKE

00:16:18.110 --> 00:16:20.312
DISPROPORTIONATELY. LIKELY TO

00:16:20.379 --> 00:16:21.880
BE AS A RESULT OF AN INTIMATE

00:16:21.947 --> 00:16:25.084
PARTNER MURDER. THEN THAN ANY

INTERVENTIONS IN DOMESTIC

VIOLENCE CASES IT'S QUITE

00:16:42.901 --> 00:16:44.570
DANGEROUS EVEN FOR OUR LAW

00:19:29.668 --> 00:19:31.737
REINTRODUCTION OF MY BILL LAST

00:19:31.803 --> 00:19:34.773
YEAR SB SEVEN SEVEN SIX WHICH

00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.542
MADE IT ON THE FLOOR OF THE

00:19:36.608 --> 00:19:38.677
ASSEMBLY WITH A FIFTY FOUR

00:19:38.744 --> 00:19:41.346
VOTES I BELIEVE. AND BUT DUE TO

00:19:41.413 --> 00:19:43.215
IT BEING THE END OF SESSION AND

00:19:43.282 --> 00:19:46.051
A HARD STOP MIDNIGHT DEADLINE.

00:19:46.118 --> 00:19:48.487
AND BILLS HAVING A DELAY

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.522
GETTING FROM THE ASSEMBLY TO

00:19:50.589 --> 00:19:51.390
THE SENATE IT NEVER REACHED THE

00:19:51.456 --> 00:19:53.659
SENATE FLOOR SO WE WERE UNABLE

00:19:53.725 --> 00:19:57.596
TO VOTE ON IT- WILD ONE CANNOT

00:19:57.663 --> 00:19:58.630
WHY COULD NOT A SEARCH WITH

00:19:58.697 --> 00:20:03.802
ALL. BUT- HE COMPLETED- S.

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.971
CERTAINTY THAT IT WOULD HAVE

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.639
GOTTEN A SIMILAR RESPONSE ON

00:20:07.706 --> 00:20:09.942
THE SENATE FLOOR I FEEL THAT-

00:20:10.008 --> 00:20:12.077
GIVEN THE VOTE IN THE ASSEMBLY

00:20:12.144 --> 00:20:15.347
IT LIKELY WHATEVER- NOW

00:20:15.414 --> 00:20:16.648
INDEPENDENT OF THAT WE'VE GOT

00:20:16.715 --> 00:20:19.685
IT BEFORE US TODAY. SO WHAT S.

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:22.921
B. SIXTEEN DOES IS IT EXPANDS

00:20:22.988 --> 00:20:25.757
UPON THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN BILL

00:20:25.824 --> 00:20:28.293
SB FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE WHICH I

00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:29.261
AUTHORED IN WHICH THE

00:20:29.328 --> 00:20:30.796
LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE

00:20:30.862 --> 00:20:33.198
GOVERNOR SIGNED. AND THAT BILL

00:20:33.265 --> 00:20:35.133
WAS THE FIRST TIME IN OVER

00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.135
FORTY YEARS THAT CALIFORNIA

00:20:37.202 --> 00:20:38.870
OPENED UP TO PUBLIC ACCESS.

00:20:38.937 --> 00:20:41.506
RECORDS AROUND CERTAIN TYPES OF

00:20:41.573 --> 00:20:43.542
POLICE MISCONDUCT NOW WHEN WE

00:20:43.609 --> 00:20:45.277
THINK ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:20:45.344 --> 00:20:47.746
OFFICIALS THEY HAVE THE MOST

00:20:47.813 --> 00:20:49.881
IMPORTANT JOB AMONGST MANY OF

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:52.451
OUR PUBLIC SERVANTS. AND THEIR

00:20:52.517 --> 00:20:54.620
ABILITY TO DO THEIR JOB IS

00:20:54.686 --> 00:20:57.889
BASED ON COMMUNITY TRUST. WHEN

00:20:57.956 --> 00:20:59.758
THE COMMUNITY DOES NOT FEEL

00:20:59.825 --> 00:21:02.327
TRUSTFUL OVERCONFIDENT ABOUT

00:21:02.394 --> 00:21:03.929
THEIR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS

00:21:03.996 --> 00:21:05.631
AND THEY WILL NOT PARTICIPATE

00:21:05.697 --> 00:21:07.499
IN FOR EXAMPLE BEING WILLING TO

00:21:07.566 --> 00:21:09.134
BE A WITNESS TO A CRIME

00:21:09.201 --> 00:21:10.836
REPORTING A CRIME OR ANY NUMBER

00:21:10.902 --> 00:21:13.105
OF THINGS. SO IT IS REALLY

00:21:13.171 --> 00:21:13.572
ESSENTIAL TO BUILD THE

00:21:13.639 --> 00:21:15.173
COMMUNITY TRUST. AND

00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:17.409
TRANSPARENCY OR SUNSHINE

00:21:17.476 --> 00:21:19.845
ASSISTS US IN DOING SO AND TO

00:21:19.911 --> 00:21:21.880
HAVE OVER FORTY YEARS OF

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:24.016
BASICALLY NO ABILITY FOR THE

00:21:24.082 --> 00:21:25.984
PUBLIC TO GET ACCESS TO RECORDS

00:21:26.051 --> 00:21:27.552
ON POLICE MISCONDUCT WAS REALLY

00:21:27.619 --> 00:21:29.021
A TRAVESTY AND WHEN WE LOOK

00:21:29.087 --> 00:21:31.256
ACROSS THE US. IT WE WERE AN

00:21:31.323 --> 00:21:33.191
OUT LIAR NOW THAT BILL WAS VERY

00:21:33.258 --> 00:21:34.693
IMPORTANT WAS GOOD BUT IT WAS

00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:36.895
VERY VERY LIMITED AND WHAT THIS

00:21:36.962 --> 00:21:39.531
BILL DOES IS BAD TO OUR ABILITY

00:21:39.598 --> 00:21:41.366
TO GET THAT PUBLIC INFORMATION

00:21:41.433 --> 00:21:43.969
AND I WILL ADD THAT OUR- PUBLIC

00:21:44.036 --> 00:21:45.137
RECORDS ACT WHICH AFFECTS EVERY

00:21:45.203 --> 00:21:47.572
OTHER. PUBLIC EMPLOYEE GIVES

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:50.242
MUCH MUCH MORE RECORDS IN INFO

00:21:50.308 --> 00:21:52.444
SO WHAT IS SIXTEEN SPECIFICALLY

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.613
DO IT ADDS TO CURRENT LAW BY

00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:58.750
ALLOWING. US TO GET RECORDS ON.

00:21:58.817 --> 00:22:01.820
FORCE THAT- I'M REASONABLE.

00:22:01.887 --> 00:22:03.689
THAT IS BEYOND JUST SHOOTING OF

00:22:03.755 --> 00:22:05.190
A WEAPON SO THERE'S A VARIETY

00:22:05.257 --> 00:22:06.992
OF DIFFERENT- UNREASONABLE

00:22:07.059 --> 00:22:09.161
FORCE IT ALSO ALLOWS US TO GET

00:22:09.227 --> 00:22:11.997
RECORDS ON OFFICERS WHO HAVE A-

00:22:12.064 --> 00:22:14.266
DEMONSTRATED. BIASED OR

00:22:14.332 --> 00:22:16.201
DISCRIMINATORY BEHAVIOR.

00:22:16.268 --> 00:22:17.669
OFFICERS WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN

00:22:17.736 --> 00:22:19.971
UNLAWFUL ARRESTS AND SEARCHES.

00:22:20.038 --> 00:22:21.940
OFFICES WHO HAVE ENGAGED IN

00:22:22.007 --> 00:22:23.475
CERTAIN DISHONESTY SUCH AS

00:22:23.542 --> 00:22:26.978
FRAMING PEOPLE. AND IT

00:22:27.045 --> 00:22:29.781
ADDITIONALLY REQUIRES THAT.

00:22:29.848 --> 00:22:31.450
WHEN AN OFFICER LEAVES AN

00:22:31.516 --> 00:22:34.186
AGENCY IF AN INVESTIGATION AND

00:22:34.252 --> 00:22:35.187
NOT A COMPLAINT ON THAT

00:22:35.253 --> 00:22:37.289
OFFICERS NOT COMPLETED THE

00:22:37.355 --> 00:22:40.058
RECORD IS STILL MAINTAINED. AND

00:22:40.125 --> 00:22:41.493
IF THE OFFICER REPLIES TO

00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:43.428
ANOTHER AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA

00:22:43.495 --> 00:22:45.030
THAT AGENCY MUST REQUEST ALL

00:22:45.097 --> 00:22:46.665
PERSONAL RECORDS AND THE

00:22:46.732 --> 00:22:48.633
IMPORTANCE OF THAT IS THAT WE

00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:50.736
HAVE SEEN. THAT SOME AGENCIES

00:22:50.802 --> 00:22:52.471
OR OFFICERS HAVE TRIED TO GET

00:22:52.537 --> 00:22:54.906
AWAY WITH NOT HAVING A RECORD

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.875
ESTABLISHED BY JUST LEAVING

00:22:56.942 --> 00:22:59.211
THEIR AGENCY QUITTING. BEFORE

00:22:59.277 --> 00:23:00.979
AN INVESTIGATION WAS COMPLETE

00:23:01.046 --> 00:23:02.781
NOW FINALLY WHAT THE BILL DOES

00:45:30.227 --> 00:45:33.263
VERY DIFFICULT TO THINK WITH

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:34.731
THE FRONTAL LOBE OF HER BRAIN

00:45:34.798 --> 00:45:36.066
IN PURSES THE REACTIVE FROM A

00:45:36.133 --> 00:45:37.668
PART OF THE ROOM OUR BRAIN SO.

00:45:37.734 --> 00:45:40.337
THAT'S THE- THE CONTEXT IN

00:45:40.404 --> 00:45:41.939
WHICH I A I'M I'M SPEAKING IN

00:45:42.005 --> 00:45:44.842
ASKING QUESTIONS BECAUSE- THERE

00:45:44.908 --> 00:45:46.009
ARE MANY ASPECTS THAT I

00:45:46.076 --> 00:45:47.311
RESPECTED AND APPRECIATED THE

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:48.679
SPELL BUT THERE ARE SOME

00:45:48.745 --> 00:45:50.747
CONCERNS THAT I DO HAVE. I'M

00:45:50.814 --> 00:45:51.715
ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:53.584
IS GOING FURTHER THAN FIVE

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:55.986
YEARS- THE IN INFORMATION IS

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:58.055
THERE A REASON FOR THAT THAT

00:45:58.122 --> 00:45:59.156
FIVE YEAR TIME FRAME THAT

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:00.290
YOU'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO GOING

00:46:00.357 --> 00:46:02.226
FURTHER BACK IN NOT HAVING A

00:46:02.292 --> 00:46:04.795
LIMITED TIME FRAME. AND COMING

00:46:04.862 --> 00:46:07.131
FROM A LOCAL PERSPECTIVE FROM

00:46:07.197 --> 00:46:09.600
THE SCHOOL BOARD WHERE- YOU

00:46:09.666 --> 00:46:10.968
KNOW I UNDERSTAND WE IN OUR

00:46:11.034 --> 00:46:12.102
SCHOOL DISTRICT IS SMALL WE

00:46:12.169 --> 00:46:13.303
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF STAFF IN

00:46:13.370 --> 00:46:15.572
OUR AND- WHEN THE REQUEST

00:46:15.639 --> 00:46:17.174
PUBLIC RECORDS IT REALLY DOES

00:46:17.241 --> 00:46:20.644
TAKE A LOT OF TIME- FROM. THE

00:46:20.711 --> 00:46:22.312
LIMITED STOCK THAT WE DO HAVE

00:46:22.379 --> 00:46:24.515
SO THAT IS A CONCERN FOR ME- AS

00:46:24.581 --> 00:46:26.550
FAR AS BE ABLE TO. BE ABLE TO

00:46:26.617 --> 00:46:29.419
PROVIDE THAT- THAT INFORMATION

00:46:29.486 --> 00:46:35.425
AND IN A TIMELY AND- IN A

00:46:35.492 --> 00:46:36.460
TIMELY WAY. ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:40.130
YOU'RE- UNLIMITED- TIME FRAMES

00:46:40.197 --> 00:46:43.767
FOR REQUESTING RECORDS. A

00:46:43.834 --> 00:46:45.435
PERMISSION TO ANSWER ANY

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:47.471
PROTECTIONS PERMISSION THANK

00:46:47.538 --> 00:46:51.508
YOU- SOME OF THE DAY'S A GOOD

00:46:51.575 --> 00:46:54.845
QUESTION AND THE HISTORY OF WHY

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:57.080
A FIVE YEAR RETENTION OF

00:46:57.147 --> 00:46:59.883
RECORDS WAS- PUT INTO PLACE IS

00:46:59.950 --> 00:47:03.420
PRIOR TO ABOUT FORTY FOUR YEARS

00:47:03.487 --> 00:47:06.156
AGO NOW. ALL POLICE RECORDS

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:07.591
WERE AVAILABLE UNDER THE PUBLIC

00:47:07.658 --> 00:47:10.794
RECORDS ACT ANY AND ALL. AND

00:47:10.861 --> 00:47:12.896
UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WAS FOUND

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:14.131
WAS THAT AGENCIES WERE

00:47:14.198 --> 00:47:16.333
DESTROYING THE RECORDS SO THEY

00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:17.634
DID NOT HAVE TO RELEASE THEM

00:47:17.701 --> 00:47:18.602
THEY DIDN'T HAVE A THAT ENOUGH

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.737
TO RELEASE IT. AND THERE WAS NO%

00:47:20.804 --> 00:47:22.439
REAL ISSUE THE PROHIBITION ON

00:47:22.506 --> 00:47:25.442
THEY'RE DESTROYING THEM. SO THE

00:47:25.509 --> 00:47:27.244
GOVERNOR BROWN IN HIS FIRST

00:47:27.311 --> 00:47:29.046
TERM SO PRIOR TO HIS MOST

00:47:29.112 --> 00:47:31.481
RECENT SERVICES GOVERNOR. ENDED

00:47:31.548 --> 00:47:36.620
UP. NEGOTIATING A BILL THAT

00:47:36.687 --> 00:47:40.824
WOULD BASICALLY. GIVE HER A NEW

00:47:40.891 --> 00:47:44.061
NóI OR WORD STOP ALL PUBLIC

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:47.130
CCESS BUT REQUIRE AGENCIES TO

00:47:47.197 --> 00:47:48.365
AT LEAST HOLD ON TO RECORDS FOR

00:47:48.432 --> 00:47:50.634
FIVE YEARS TO STOP THE

00:47:50.701 --> 00:47:52.936
DESTRUCTION OF RECORDS. NOW

00:47:53.003 --> 00:47:54.571
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT OTHER

00:47:54.638 --> 00:47:56.907
PUBLIC THAT THE PUBLIC RECORDS

00:47:56.974 --> 00:47:58.542
LINE ITSELF IF YOUR EVEN YOUR

00:47:58.609 --> 00:48:00.110
SCHOOL THE DID THE ISSUE OF THE

00:48:00.177 --> 00:48:01.778
SCHOOL DISTRICT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:48:01.845 --> 00:48:04.481
THE ROLE OF THEY CAN ONLY KEEP

00:48:04.548 --> 00:48:06.216
RECORDS FOR FIVE YEARS THEY

00:48:06.283 --> 00:48:07.251
HAVE THE ROLE THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:48:07.317 --> 00:48:10.020
KEEP RECORDS. THERE ISN'T A

00:48:10.087 --> 00:48:11.822
PARTICULAR TIME PERIOD. AND

00:48:11.888 --> 00:48:13.890
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT ALL USED

00:48:13.957 --> 00:48:16.093
THE EXAMPLE OF THE DIRECTOR OF

00:48:16.159 --> 00:48:19.796
IN CASE AND- WHERE HE IS NOW-

00:48:19.863 --> 00:48:24.034
BEFORE THE COURT FOR THE-

00:48:24.101 --> 00:48:25.569
MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD AND-

00:48:25.636 --> 00:48:27.170
IT'S A REAL NUMBER ONE WE WOULD

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:29.740
HAVE NEVER KNOWN. IN CALIFORNIA

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.375
PRIOR TO FOURTEEN TWENTY WELL

00:48:31.441 --> 00:48:32.943
EVEN UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.177
WE WOULDN'T HAVE KNOWN THAT HE

00:48:34.244 --> 00:48:35.912
HAD A HISTORY OF FOR EXAMPLE

00:48:35.979 --> 00:48:37.281
USE OF FORCE AND ALSO

00:48:37.347 --> 00:48:38.749
DISCRIMINATORY OR BIASED

00:48:38.815 --> 00:48:40.984
BEHAVIOR WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

00:48:41.051 --> 00:48:43.954
ABLE TO GET THAT. NOW IT'S ALSO

00:48:44.021 --> 00:48:45.355
WOULD WOULD APPEAR FROM THE

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:48.091
REPORTS IS THAT. WITH THAT

00:48:48.158 --> 00:48:50.360
INDIVIDUAL IT GOES BACK. MANY

00:48:50.427 --> 00:48:53.730
MANY MANY YEARS. AND HAD WE AND

00:48:53.797 --> 00:48:55.966
IF THIS WERE CALIFORNIA AND WE

00:48:56.033 --> 00:48:57.801
WOULD HAVE PERHAPS IF HE HAD

00:48:57.868 --> 00:49:01.204
NOT. ACTED IN SUCH A WAY AND

00:49:01.271 --> 00:49:02.172
MAYBE THERE WAS ONLY ONE

00:49:02.239 --> 00:49:03.473
INCIDENT OVER A FIVE YEAR

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.875
PERIOD WE WOULD THINK OKAY THIS

00:49:04.941 --> 00:49:06.109
IS AN OFFICER ONLY HAD ONE

00:49:06.176 --> 00:49:08.145
INCIDENT WHERE IS MAYBE OVER

00:49:08.211 --> 00:49:10.147
TEN YEAR PERIOD HE HAD TWENTY.

00:49:10.213 --> 00:49:13.884
SO THE FIVE YEAR RETENTION THAT

00:49:13.950 --> 00:49:15.919
WAS IN THE ORIGINAL LAW. WAS

00:49:15.986 --> 00:49:18.855
REAL PRETTY ARBITRARY I DIDN'T

00:49:18.922 --> 00:49:21.858
REALLY GIVE US A FULL. PICTURE

00:49:21.925 --> 00:49:24.528
OF. A CIRCUMSTANCE AN OFFICER

00:49:24.594 --> 00:49:25.429
AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT MANY

00:49:25.495 --> 00:49:27.864
TIMES AFTER THERE IS A USE OF

00:49:27.931 --> 00:49:29.333
FORCE AND OFFICERS PUT ON

00:49:29.399 --> 00:49:30.567
ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE UNTIL

00:49:30.634 --> 00:49:32.936
INVESTIGATION IS COMPLETED AND

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:35.172
WE'VE TAKEN THREE FOUR YEARS

00:49:35.238 --> 00:49:35.739
BEFORE WE COMPLETE

00:49:35.806 --> 00:49:38.508
INVESTIGATIONS SO IN THAT THREE

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.643
OR FOUR YEARS THAT THEY MAY BE

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:41.545
ON ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE. OF

00:49:41.611 --> 00:49:42.512
COURSE THEY'RE NOT ENGAGING IN

00:49:42.579 --> 00:49:44.748
OTHER BEHAVIORS BUT MAYBE THEY

00:49:44.815 --> 00:49:48.051
DID WELL PRIOR TO THAT. AND SO

00:49:48.118 --> 00:49:49.353
AGAIN I'M TRYING TO PUT HAT

00:49:49.419 --> 00:49:53.123
TIME PERIOD- NOW THE VAST

00:49:53.190 --> 00:49:55.258
MAJORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

00:49:55.325 --> 00:49:58.295
OFFICERS IN THE STATE. DO NOT

00:49:58.362 --> 00:49:59.830
DRAW THEIR WEAPONS DO NOT

00:49:59.896 --> 00:50:01.631
ENGAGE IN REASONABLE FORCE AND

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.300
DO NOT ENGAGE IN THE MISCONDUCT

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:05.335
THAT THESE THAT ARE MY BILLS

00:50:05.402 --> 00:50:07.871
EITHER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE OR

00:50:07.938 --> 00:50:10.707
THIS ONE WOULD AFFECT- SO WE'RE

00:50:10.774 --> 00:50:12.542
REALLY TALKING ABOUT

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:14.444
UNFORTUNATELY A SMALL PERCENT.

00:50:14.511 --> 00:50:16.680
BUT IT THAT IS WHY WE NEED THIS

00:50:16.747 --> 00:50:19.082
INFORMATION SO BADLY BECAUSE WE

00:50:19.149 --> 00:50:21.151
NEED TO BE ABLE TO HOLD

00:50:21.218 --> 00:50:23.453
AGENCIES ACCOUNTABLE. AND WHILE

00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:24.588
JONATHON FELDMAN FROM THE

00:50:24.654 --> 00:50:25.922
POLICE CHIEFS DIDN'T INDICATE

00:50:25.989 --> 00:50:28.759
WHY THE POLICE CHIEFS SUPPORTED

00:50:28.825 --> 00:50:29.359
FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE PART OF IT

00:50:29.426 --> 00:50:31.762
WAS EVEN THE CHEEKS COULD NOT.

00:50:31.828 --> 00:50:34.331
ACCESS INFORMATION ABOUT

00:50:34.398 --> 00:50:35.565
OFFICERS THEY WERE HIRING FROM

00:50:35.632 --> 00:50:37.901
ANOTHER. JURISDICTION SO THEY

00:50:37.968 --> 00:50:39.269
DIDN'T KNOW WERE THAT WERE THEY

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:40.604
GETTING AN OFFICER WITH A

00:50:40.670 --> 00:50:42.706
HISTORY OF. EITHER BIASED

00:50:42.773 --> 00:50:45.008
BEHAVIOR OR UNLAWFUL SEARCHES

00:50:45.075 --> 00:50:47.577
OR YOU KNOW USE OF FORCE THEY

00:50:47.644 --> 00:50:49.446
DIDN'T KNOW SO NOW THEY CAN NO.

00:50:49.513 --> 00:50:52.582
AND AS YOU HEARD THE PRINCIPAL

00:50:52.649 --> 00:50:56.353
CONCERN THE CHIEFS HAVE IS THE-

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:58.455
IN FACT I AM NOT TO MINIMIZE IT

00:50:58.522 --> 00:50:59.356
BUT THE SORT OF PAPERWORK

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:02.659
BURDEN. BUT IF WE LOOK AT.

00:51:02.726 --> 00:51:04.728
THERE WILL BE ABSOLUTELY THERE

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:06.363
WILL BE A GREAT INCREASE IN

00:51:06.430 --> 00:51:08.432
REQUEST AS SOON AS THE BILL IS

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:10.133
IN EFFECT BUT THEN AFTER THAT

00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:11.935
SO THEN PASSED THINGS WILL HAVE

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.737
TO BE DISCLOSED YES THAT PUTS A

00:51:13.804 --> 00:51:15.539
BURDEN ON THE AGENCY. BUT ONCE

00:51:15.605 --> 00:51:17.607
THOSE ARE DISCLOSED IT IS ONLY

00:51:17.674 --> 00:51:20.510
ANY ANY ACTION MOVING FORWARD.

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:22.412
AND WHAT WE WOULD CERTAINLY

00:51:22.479 --> 00:51:23.947
HOPE IS THAT VERY FEW OF THESE

00:51:24.014 --> 00:51:25.449
ACTIONS WOULD OCCUR AND THAT

00:51:25.515 --> 00:51:27.918
OUR AGE AND SO THEN THIS IS NOT

00:51:27.984 --> 00:51:29.753
A BURDEN. SO I JUST WANTED TO

00:51:29.820 --> 00:51:32.956
BRING THAT UP. THANK YOU. THANK

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:35.258
YOU HE DISCOVERS WHAT. SUCH AS

00:51:35.325 --> 00:51:36.560
ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS GOOD

00:51:36.626 --> 00:51:38.061
POINT AND I THINK YU MENTIONED

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:39.262
ONE OF THE FACTORS THAT I

00:51:39.329 --> 00:51:40.931
ACTUALLY. QUITE ADMIRED ABOUT

00:51:40.997 --> 00:51:42.098
THE BILL IS THE FACT THAT YOU

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:44.100
KNOW WHEN. POLICE OFFICERS ARE

00:51:44.167 --> 00:51:45.335
BEING HIGHER CONSIDER FURTHER

00:51:45.402 --> 00:51:46.670
CONSIDERATION OR FOR OTHER

00:51:46.736 --> 00:51:48.238
POSITIONS IN OTHER AREAS THEY

00:51:48.305 --> 00:51:50.207
WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO LOOK. INTO

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:52.676
THE PAST HERE I THINK- THAT IS

00:51:52.742 --> 00:51:55.812
ACTUALLY VERY- FAVORABLE. FOR

00:51:55.879 --> 00:51:56.780
THE POLICE STATIONS THAT ARE

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:57.981
THE POLICE DISTRICT ARE

00:51:58.048 --> 00:51:59.249
ACTUALLY HIRING THEM SO THAT

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:00.584
WAS A GOOD POINT AND IKE I

00:52:00.650 --> 00:52:01.785
SAID. I THINK THERE ARE MANY

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:03.587
MANY GOOD POINTS. THAT ON THERE

00:52:03.653 --> 00:52:05.021
I WAS JUST I AM VERY CONCERNED

00:52:05.088 --> 00:52:07.390
ABOUT THE LIMITATIONS- OR THE

00:52:07.457 --> 00:52:08.391
PARAMETERS THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:52:08.458 --> 00:52:10.861
ANY- VERY DEFINED PARAMETERS

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:14.531
AND IT MAKES IT VERY. ON AT.

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:16.399
JUST OPEN ENDED BASICALLY SO

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:18.535
THAT'S AND THAT'S MY MAJOR

00:52:18.602 --> 00:52:19.870
CONCERN AS FAR AS A TOOL FOR

00:52:19.936 --> 00:52:22.272
MANY. AREAS HOPEFULLY THAT THEY

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:23.473
WILL BE HOPING YOU DON'T HAVE

00:52:23.540 --> 00:52:25.609
THE CASE TO HAVE TO BE IN THE

00:52:25.675 --> 00:52:27.244
AND THAT. BUT MOVING FORWARD

00:52:27.310 --> 00:52:29.246
STILL I WOULD LOVE TO SEE. MORE

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:32.215
OF A- MORE DEFINED PARAMETERS.

00:52:32.282 --> 00:52:34.784
AND ALSO A CONSIDERATION AS

00:52:34.851 --> 00:52:37.053
WELL. IN THE- BEHAVIOR

00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.923
ESPECIALLY WITH WITH- INCIDENTS

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:40.991
THAT HAPPENED YOU KNOW FURTHER

00:52:41.057 --> 00:52:43.193
THAN- FURTHER BACK THAN FIVE

00:52:43.260 --> 00:52:46.429
YEARS. IS THAT WHEN I LOOK. AT

00:52:46.496 --> 00:52:48.098
TRAINING AND I LOOK AT

00:52:48.164 --> 00:52:51.701
EXPERIENCE ESPECIALLY WHEN

00:52:51.768 --> 00:52:53.837
WHERE MUCH OF THE TIME YOU'RE

00:52:53.904 --> 00:52:55.672
YOU'RE YOU'RE REALLY ADAM YOU

00:52:55.739 --> 00:52:57.407
KNOW YOU YOUR UNCERTAIN PART OF

00:52:57.474 --> 00:52:58.441

IT'S A COMMON SENSE MEASURE

00:56:22.779 --> 00:56:24.814
THAT'S LONG OVERDUE I THINK

00:56:24.881 --> 00:56:26.783
HISTORY HAS SHOWN US THAT THE

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.119

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:33.223
CASE CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE

00:56:33.289 --> 00:56:35.024
CAREER IT'S NOT A ONE AND DONE

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.493
IT'S NOT A LACK OF EXPERIENCE

00:56:36.559 --> 00:56:38.995
IT'S A MINDSET. AND I FIND IT

00:56:39.062 --> 00:56:41.998

FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO

00:56:59.549 --> 00:57:01.184

MEAN THAT WAS THEIR DECISION-

00:57:28.711 --> 00:57:30.513

00:57:30.580 --> 00:57:31.581
OF THE BOOK OF THE POLICE

00:57:31.648 --> 00:57:34.117

STRIKING WAS- CEPHUS JOHNSON

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:02.498

REFERENCED A MAYBE THERE WERE

01:00:22.085 --> 01:00:23.786
OTHER PEOPLE THAT WE NEED A

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:25.655

01:00:29.492 --> 01:00:31.794
WHEN I SAY THAT I ALSO SEE THAT

01:00:31.861 --> 01:00:33.963
AS IN THE INDICATED EARLIER THE

01:00:34.030 --> 01:00:36.032
VAST VAST MAJORITY OF OUR LAW

01:00:36.099 --> 01:00:38.801
ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS ARE NOT.

01:00:38.868 --> 01:00:41.471
IN THAT MODE THEY ARE NOT AND

THEIR PARTICULAR ATTITUDES TAKE

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.311
THEIR LIVES IN THEIR HANDS

01:00:48.378 --> 01:00:50.546
EVERY TIME THEY PUT ON THAT

01:00:50.613 --> 01:00:53.116
UNIFORM AND WALK OUT THEIR DOOR

01:00:53.182 --> 01:00:53.816
AND WE KNOW THAT THEY ARE PUT

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:56.219
AT RISK VERY OFTEN BUT AND

01:00:56.285 --> 01:00:58.021
SADLY IF WE REFER TO THE BILL

01:00:58.087 --> 01:00:59.789
WE HEARD JUST EARLIER VERY

01:00:59.856 --> 01:01:02.325
OFTEN IN DOMESTIC CALLS THAT

01:01:02.392 --> 01:01:03.960
THAT CAN BE THE MOST RISKY AND

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:06.095
YET THEY RESPOND AND THEY SHOW

01:01:06.162 --> 01:01:10.333
UP. AND SO WE WANT TO ACHIEVE

01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.301
MY OBJECTIVE IS TO ACHIEVE

01:01:54.610 --> 01:01:57.013
FOR EXAMPLE NEW YORK STATE OHIO

01:41:28.582 --> 01:41:30.751
THE SAME WAY IT'S BEEN DONE FOR

01:41:34.788 --> 01:41:36.857
USUALLY AUTHORIZED BY A LAW

01:41:36.924 --> 01:41:38.625
ENFORCEMENT LOCAL JURISDICTION

01:41:38.692 --> 01:41:39.760

NOTHING CHANGES JUST AS YOU.

01:41:43.096 --> 01:41:45.098
HAVE PROCESSES SHOW THEIR ID TO

01:41:45.165 --> 01:41:47.501
COMING HERE TO COME TO A NASH

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:50.304
NATURAL OR NATURAL DISASTER THE

01:41:50.370 --> 01:41:51.672
SAME WOULD BE FOR MARCH A

01:41:51.738 --> 01:41:53.040
PROTESTER ANY OTHER KIND OF

01:41:53.106 --> 01:41:55.309
RALEIGH CHAU- THEY FIGURE IT

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:56.577
OUT FOR ANYTHING ELSE SO I

01:41:56.643 --> 01:41:57.177
DON'T KNOW WHERE TE CONFUSION

01:41:57.244 --> 01:41:59.546
WITH- HAPPENED JUST BECAUSE

01:41:59.613 --> 01:42:03.350
IT'S A RALLY OR PROTEST OR

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:04.318
BLACK LIVES MATTER. OR IN THE-

01:42:04.384 --> 01:42:05.619
HAVE ASSEMBLED. I'M JUST GONNA

01:42:05.686 --> 01:42:06.720
CARRY JUST BECAUSE I KNOW HOW

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:10.123
PEOPLE CAN- FOR DOCUMENTS

01:42:10.190 --> 01:42:11.458
FORCES DOCUMENTS AND THAT

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:12.426
THAT'S THE REASON FOR MY

01:42:12.493 --> 01:42:13.994
QUESTION IS JUST YOU KNOW HOW

01:42:14.061 --> 01:42:15.596
DO WE ASSURE ESPECIALLY SINCE

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.130

NOT HAVING TO- HAVING MORE

01:42:24.938 --> 01:42:26.974
ACCESS BASICALLY AND SO THAT IS

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:28.442
THE CONCERN IF WE GIVE THEM

01:42:28.509 --> 01:42:30.611
MORE ACCESS THAN- HAVE MORE

01:42:30.677 --> 01:42:31.678

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:40.487
ASSURE THAT THE PAST ARE NOT

01:42:40.554 --> 01:42:42.756
BEING FORTUNATE BEING-

01:42:42.823 --> 01:42:44.525

GUIDELINES THAT ALREADY EXIST

01:43:04.011 --> 01:43:05.779
AND WHILE THIS ISN'T EXPAND

01:43:05.846 --> 01:43:07.147
UPON ANYTHING SO AGAIN WE CAN

01:43:07.214 --> 01:43:08.448

LINE OF A NATURAL DISASTER BE
