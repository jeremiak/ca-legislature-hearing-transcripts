OF AB EIGHTEEN FORTY FIVE. METROPOLITAN IS A REGIONAL WHOLESALER THAT DELIVERS WATER TO TWENTY SIX MEMBER AGENCIES SERVING ABOUT NINETEEN MILLION PEOPLE AND LOCAL BUSINESSES IN LOS ANGELES. ORANGE RIVERSIDE SAN BERNARD DINO SAN DIEGO AND VENTURA COUNTIES. CALIFORNIA IS IN A- IN YEAR THREE OF A WORSENING DROUGHT SHRINKING ALLOCATIONS THE FIRST EVER WATER SHORTAGE DECLARED ON THE COLORADO RIVER. LAID BARE THE LONG TERM RISKS OF DROUGHT ON SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S WATER SUPPLY. IN RESPONSE METROPOLITAN IS WORKING TO EXPEDITE. THE NEW DROUGHT PROOF WATER SUPPLY SUPPLY OF WATER. IN A SET OF EMERGENCY MITIGATION MEASURES TO MAKE OUR REGIONAL DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM MORE RESILIENT. AND ABLE TO ADAPT TO THE REALITIES OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AS A PUBLIC AGENCY WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED TO THE TRADITIONAL DESIGN BID BUILD MODEL FOR THE DELIVERY OF PUBLIC WORKS CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS WHICH CAN BE INEFFICIENT. AND INFLEXIBLE FOR LARGE TIME SENSITIVE AND COMPLEX PROJECTS LIKE THE ONES THAT WE HAVE PLANNED. METROPOLITANA SEEKING AUTHORIZATION FOR THREE ADDITIONAL PROJECT DELIVERY MODELS TO ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER KEY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. IN AN EFFICIENT AND TIMELY MANNER. THE ENHANCE DELIVERY OF PROJECTS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR EXISTING FACILITIES IS CRITICAL TO OUR REGION. AND MANY WATER AGENCIES AND BUSINESSES THAT DEPEND UPON METROPOLITAN TO DELIVER HIGH QUALITY RELIABLE SUPPLY. COLLABORATIVE CONTRACTING METHODS LIKE DESIGN BUILD PROGRESSIVE DESIGN BUILD AND CONSTRUCTION MANAGER GENERAL CONTRACTOR ON LARGE SCALE PROJECTS LIKE OURS WOULD ALLOW PROJECT. WOULD ALLOW PROJECTS TO AVOID DELAYS THE CAN OFTEN HAPPEN WITH LINEAR PROJECT DELIVERY APPROACHES LIKE DESIGN BID BUILD BY OVERLAPPING A PROJECTS DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION PHASES AND CAN ALSO REDUCE RISKS OF OVERALL COST TO RATE PAYERS. THE PROJECTS THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY METHODS INCLUDE THE REGIONAL RECYCLED WATER PROGRAM WHICH IS A PARTNERSHIP WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY SANITATION DISTRICTS TO CREATE A NEW LOCAL WATER SUPPLY ENOUGH TO SERVE MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THE DESIGN AND CONSTRUCTION OF SIXTY MILES THE NEW CONVEYANCE PIPELINES AND PUMP STATIONS AND PORTIONS OF THE ADVANCED WATER TREATMENT FACILITIES WOULD BENEFIT FROM ALTERNATIVE DELIVERY METHODS. METROPOLITAN ALSO PLANS TO UNDERTAKE SEVERAL PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS TO MITIGATE CURRENT AND FUTURE DROUGHT IMPACTS TO PART OF OUR SERVICE AREA HOPE THAT ARE WHOLLY DEPENDENT ON STATE WATER PROJECT IMPORTS. THE PROJECT INVOLVED NEW PUMP STATIONS AND UPGRADES TO LOCAL CONVEYANCE FACILITIES TO FACILITATE THE MOVEMENT OF WATER STORED IN OUR SYSTEM. COLLECTIVELY THESE PROJECTS REPRESENT THE RAPID ADAPTATION TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS AND THESE PROJECTS WOULD GREATLY BENEFIT FROM MORE EFFICIENT DELIVERY METHODS TO EXPEDITE CONSTRUCTION.

NOW BARONE IS ACTIVELY SEEKING TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR GROUNDWATER SUPPLIES AND WOULD GREATLY APPRECIATE THE SUNSET EXTENSION OF THE STATUTE THAT ASSEMBLYMEMBER GARCIA PASSED VIA AB THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW TO THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT OF BARONE IS A CURRENT LIMITED ACCESS TO WATER. CORONA WAS FORCIBLY REMOVED FROM THEIR ORIGINAL RESERVATION ALONG THE BANKS OF THE SAN DIEGO RIVER IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO SO THAT THE EL CAPITAN RESERVOIR COULD BE CONSTRUCTED FOR THE BENEFIT OF URBAN SAN DIEGO. SINCE THEIR MOVE TO THEIR SUBSTITUTE RESERVATION CURRENT LOCATION BROWN HAS ONLY HAD ACCESS TO GROUNDWATERSUPPLIES WHILE THESE SUPPLIES HAVE BEEN MAXIMIZED AND SUSTAINABLE USE THROUGH CONSERVATION AND WATER RECYCLING EFFORTS- SUPPLEMENTAL WATER IS CRITICAL TO BROWN IS FUTURE. INTO THE TRAVEL RESIDENTS OF THE RESERVATION WE GREATLY APPRECIATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS MEASURE TO EXTEND THE SUNSET ON AS PER LEGISLATION SO THAT VERONA AND OTHER TRIBES IN SIMILAR NEED. CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES OF AN APPROPRIATE OPPORTUNITY TO GAIN ACCESS TO WATER IN A MANNER THAT IS HIGHLY RESPECTFUL OF HISTORY AND TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND WE URGE OUR AYE VOTE.

RELIGIOUS COMMUNITIES FROM THE BAY AREA SAN DIEGO HAVE SUCCESSFULLY IDENTIFIED UNDER UTILIZED PROPERTIES AND REDEVELOPMENT AFFORDABLE HOUSING THROUGH ONE OF MY PREVIOUS BILLS AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE. HOWEVER PLANS FOR PROPOSED RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS A NEW HOUSING HAVE HIT ROADBLOCKS. DEVELOPERS CANNOT UTILIZE AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE BECAUSE THE LAW ONLY ALLOWS FOR A PARKING REDUCTION FOR EXISTING STRUCTURES. AB TWENTY TWO FORTY FOUR BUILDS UPON AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE BY REDUCING PARKING REQUIREMENTS FOR NEWLY CONSTRUCTED RELIGIOUS INSTITUTIONS AND ALLOWS FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICALLY NEEDED AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROJECTS.
