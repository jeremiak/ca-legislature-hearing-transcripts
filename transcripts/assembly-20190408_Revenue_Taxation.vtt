FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:25:55.654 --> 00:25:57.422

AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER STATED

00:26:04.396 --> 00:26:05.730

AND CONVERTING THAT TO LONG TERM

00:26:12.437 --> 00:26:14.472
RESTRICTED AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

00:26:14.539 --> 00:26:16.708
THIS IS QUICKER AND CHEAPER THAN

00:26:16.775 --> 00:26:18.610
BUILDING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING

00:26:18.677 --> 00:26:20.879

HEARD MUCH BOTH FROM THE

00:29:32.704 --> 00:29:33.138
GOVERNOR MEMBERS OF THE

00:29:33.204 --> 00:29:34.372
LEGISLATURE.

00:29:34.439 --> 00:29:36.774
AROUND THE PROBLEM WORD NOW THAT

00:29:36.841 --> 00:29:39.344
THE THE HIGH RENTS ARE IMPACTING

00:29:39.410 --> 00:29:40.345
MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS

00:29:40.411 --> 00:29:43.715
PRIMARILY AND HIGH COST COUNTIES --

00:29:43.781 --> 00:29:45.049
THE STATE IS CONTEMPLATING MANY

00:29:45.116 --> 00:29:46.417
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO

00:29:46.484 --> 00:29:47.752
INCENTIVIZE THE PRODUCTION OF

00:29:47.819 --> 00:29:49.420
RENTAL HOUSING FOR THIS INCOME

00:29:49.487 --> 00:29:51.422
BAND AND THIS BILL DOES A VERY

00:29:51.489 --> 00:29:52.957
CAREFUL JOB OF THREADING THE

00:29:53.024 --> 00:29:54.526
NEEDLE TO ENSURE.

00:29:54.592 --> 00:29:56.060
THAT WHAT THE STATE IS DOING

00:29:56.127 --> 00:29:58.429
REALLY TARGETS THOSE UNITS IN

00:29:58.496 --> 00:29:59.797
THOSE HIGH COST COUNTY SO THAT

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:01.299
WE'RE NOT TAKING AWAY NECESSARY

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:02.867

00:30:04.702 --> 00:30:07.572
AND ALSO NOT NOT -- SUBSIDIZING

MODERATE INCOME HOUSEHOLDS IN

00:30:10.542 --> 00:30:12.310
SOME PARTS OF SEE CAN'T AFFORD --

SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MEASURE WE

00:30:15.446 --> 00:30:16.548
THINK IT REALLY COMPLEMENTS THE

00:30:16.614 --> 00:30:17.615
OTHER EFFORTS THAT WILL PAIR

00:30:17.682 --> 00:30:19.250
PERFECTLY WITH WHAT LOCALS ARE

00:30:19.317 --> 00:30:21.986

00:30:22.053 --> 00:30:22.320
INCOME BAND.

00:30:22.387 --> 00:30:23.888
AND WILL ALSO FARE VERY WELL

00:30:23.955 --> 00:30:25.456

THIS BILL WILL BE USING KINDS IN

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:40.398
KIND I'M.

00:31:40.465 --> 00:31:41.532
IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LOW

00:31:41.599 --> 00:31:42.467
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT

00:31:42.533 --> 00:31:44.068
PROGRAM WHERE THERE'S A SIMILAR

00:31:44.135 --> 00:31:45.937
MINISTRATION AT THAT THE SENSORS

00:31:46.004 --> 00:31:47.805

I JUST SKIM THROUGH THE LETTER

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:51.042

00:31:51.109 --> 00:31:52.744
JUST REACH OUT TO MY SISTER TO

00:31:52.810 --> 00:31:54.512
UNDERSTAND -- THE GIST OF THIS

00:31:54.579 --> 00:31:55.913
IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT IN

00:31:55.980 --> 00:31:57.882
OUR CITY -- SHE DOESN'T SHARE

00:31:57.949 --> 00:31:59.217

WERE RAISED WAS SAID.

00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:06.391
IT IT'S SUGGESTED THAT THERE'S

00:32:06.457 --> 00:32:08.026
SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT

00:32:08.092 --> 00:32:09.027
CONSTITUTES PROPER RENT

00:32:09.093 --> 00:32:10.828
RESTRICTIONS BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO

00:32:10.895 --> 00:32:12.363

00:42:29.647 --> 00:42:34.852
[inaudible] ONE OF I DON'T ENVY

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:39.924
YOU TODAY.

00:42:39.990 --> 00:42:41.725
GOOD AFTERNOON JENNIFER BAKER

00:42:41.792 --> 00:42:42.526
WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS

00:42:42.593 --> 00:42:44.728
ASSOCIATION AND IT LET ME

00:42:44.795 --> 00:42:47.197
PREFACE BY SAYING WE WE DON'T

00:42:47.264 --> 00:42:48.933
OBJECT AT ALL TO THE GOALS THAT

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:50.267
ARE TRYING TO BE ACHIEVED THEIR

00:42:50.334 --> 00:42:52.036
EXTREMELY MERITORIOUS AND WE

00:42:52.102 --> 00:42:53.304
THINK THAT CREATIVE SOLUTIONS

00:42:53.370 --> 00:42:55.272
CAN BE PUT TOGETHER. TO MAKE

00:42:55.339 --> 00:42:56.740
SURE THAT ADEQUATE FUNDING AND

00:42:56.807 --> 00:42:58.809
SUPPORT IS PROVIDED THE REASON

00:42:58.876 --> 00:43:00.177
THAT WERE OPPOSED TO THE MEASURE

00:43:00.244 --> 00:43:01.278
IN ITS CURRENT FORM YOU'LL BE

00:43:01.345 --> 00:43:02.880
GETTING A NUMBER OF OTHER OPPOSE

00:43:02.947 --> 00:43:05.549
LETTERS IF ON OTHER TAX CREDITS --

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.018
VERY SHORTLY -- TAX CREDIT TO DO

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:10.354
BECAUSE COST MONEY AND FORTY

00:43:10.421 --> 00:43:11.789
CENTS OF EVERY TAX CREDIT THAT

00:43:11.855 --> 00:43:13.557
IS CREATED ACTUALLY WOULD BE

00:43:13.624 --> 00:43:15.159
MONEY THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE

00:43:15.225 --> 00:43:16.293
GONE TO PROP NINETY EIGHT IN

00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.561
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS.

00:43:17.628 --> 00:43:19.263
SO IT IS ACTUALLY DIVERTING

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.332
MONEY THAT WOULD HELP SCHOOLS

00:43:21.398 --> 00:43:22.833
56% OF OUR CHILDREN ON OUR

00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:25.069
SCHOOLS ARE IN PRE REDUCE LUNCH

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:26.704
SO WE ARE ALREADY.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:28.839
MAKING SHORT -- WE'RE HAVING A

00:43:28.906 --> 00:43:30.174
DIFFICULT TIME MAKING SURE THAT

00:43:30.240 --> 00:43:32.376
WE CAN ADEQUATELY MEET THE NEEDS

00:43:32.443 --> 00:43:34.812
OF OUR STUDENTS AND THESE ISSUES

00:43:34.878 --> 00:43:36.714
ARE ARE BECOMING.

00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.615
MORE COMPLICATED THAT THE LOCAL

00:43:38.682 --> 00:43:40.651
LEVEL YOU'RE WE'RE HEARING A LOT

00:43:40.718 --> 00:43:42.820
MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT --

00:43:42.886 --> 00:43:44.688
POSSIBLE SCRIPT STRIKES BECAUSE

00:43:44.755 --> 00:43:46.256
EDUCATION FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:48.125
ADEQUATE FOR SO LONG AND THAT'S

00:43:48.192 --> 00:43:49.259
ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S BECOMING

00:43:49.326 --> 00:43:52.529
MORE TENSE -- WE HAVE ASKED --

00:43:52.596 --> 00:43:54.331
FOR A MORATORIUM ESSENTIALLY ON

00:43:54.398 --> 00:43:56.233
TAX CREDITS IN TILL THERE CAN BE

00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:58.235
AN ADEQUATE EVALUATION OF ALL OF

00:43:58.302 --> 00:43:59.937
THE EXISTING TAX CREDITS THAT

00:44:00.004 --> 00:44:01.338
ARE ON THE BOOKS WE LOOKED AT

00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:02.339
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:44:02.406 --> 00:44:04.708
EXPENDITURES FOR THE LAST DECADE.

00:44:04.775 --> 00:44:06.377
ON THE LAST DECADE CALIFORNIA

00:44:06.443 --> 00:44:08.012
PAID OUT OVER FIFTY BILLION

00:44:08.078 --> 00:44:09.880
DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS DURING

00:44:09.947 --> 00:44:12.349
THAT SAME DECADE PROPOSITION

00:44:12.416 --> 00:44:12.850
NINETY EIGHT WHICH FUNDS

00:44:12.916 --> 00:44:15.753
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS I HAD SIXTY

00:44:15.819 --> 00:44:17.321
FIVE BILLION DOLLARS REDUCE WE

00:44:17.388 --> 00:44:19.023
LOST OVER.

00:44:19.089 --> 00:44:19.523
THIRTY THOUSAND TEACHING

00:44:19.590 --> 00:44:21.225
POSITIONS AND AS YOU MANY OF YOU

00:44:21.291 --> 00:44:23.260
THAT HAVE CHILDREN NO THAT THAT

00:44:23.327 --> 00:44:24.762
AMOUNT OF SERVICES THAT WERE

00:44:24.828 --> 00:44:25.929
PROVIDED IN SCHOOLS WERE

00:44:25.996 --> 00:44:27.631
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED SO WE

00:44:27.698 --> 00:44:28.699
WOULD LIKE.

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:30.501
TO STRONGLY ENCOURAGE OF THE

00:44:30.567 --> 00:44:32.536
AUTHOR AND THE COMMITTEE TO FIND

00:44:32.603 --> 00:44:34.605
AN ALTERNATIVE FUNDING MECHANISM

00:44:34.671 --> 00:44:36.073
FOR THE BILL BY EITHER LOOKING

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.875
AT EXISTING TAX CREDITS THAT

00:44:37.941 --> 00:44:40.711
MIGHT NOT BE MEETING THE THE

00:44:40.778 --> 00:44:42.212
GOALS THEY WERE INTENDED TO IT.

00:44:42.279 --> 00:44:43.347
TO PROVIDE TO LOOK AT TRYING TO

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:45.416
FIND SOME OF THOSE REVENUES TO

00:44:45.482 --> 00:44:46.917
REPLACE THIS WAY WE'RE NOT

00:44:46.984 --> 00:44:49.153
ADDING ON TO THE FUNDING THAT

00:44:49.219 --> 00:44:50.587
HAS ALREADY BEEN DIVERTED FROM

00:44:50.654 --> 00:44:52.289
CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND IF THAT

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.757
COULD HAPPEN WE WOULD BE MORE

00:44:53.824 --> 00:44:55.492
THAN WILLING TO HELP TO FIND AN

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:57.194
ADEQUATE PATH FORWARD BECAUSE WE

00:44:57.261 --> 00:44:57.361
DO.

00:44:57.428 --> 00:44:59.329
BELIEVE THAT THE I. T. C. IS

00:44:59.396 --> 00:45:01.198
VERY MERITORIOUS WE JUST WANT TO

00:45:01.265 --> 00:45:02.966
MAKE SURE IT DOESN'T COME ON THE

00:45:03.033 --> 00:45:03.901
BACK TO KIDS BECAUSE WE

00:45:03.967 --> 00:45:05.836
ABSOLUTELY KNOW THAT THE INTENT

00:45:05.903 --> 00:45:07.504
IS NOT.

00:45:07.571 --> 00:45:10.374
TO TAKE MORE FROM CHILDREN.

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.042
ADDITIONAL WHEN WITNESSES IN

00:45:12.109 --> 00:45:13.277
OPPOSITION.

00:45:13.343 --> 00:45:14.745
SCENE NINE COMMENTS AND

00:45:14.812 --> 00:45:17.581
QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

00:45:17.648 --> 00:45:19.149
YEAH I HAVE A COUPLE AYE TO AND

00:45:19.216 --> 00:45:20.517
I'M NOT SURE I'M LOOKING AT THE

00:45:20.584 --> 00:45:22.352
REPUBLICAN ANALYSIS HERE AND I

00:45:22.419 --> 00:45:23.320
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THIS IS

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:24.455
CORRECT IT SAYS THIS CURRENT

00:45:24.521 --> 00:45:26.156
PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO COST FOUR

00:45:26.223 --> 00:45:28.225
HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS.

00:45:28.292 --> 00:45:30.094
IS THAT IS THAT ACCURATE.

00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.495
WHAT'S WHAT'S THE TOTAL COSTS IN

00:45:31.562 --> 00:45:33.897
IT BUT IF IT'S NOT IT'S NOT NOT

00:45:33.964 --> 00:45:35.232
WRITTEN GREAT HERE JUST WANNA

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.834
MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S WHAT THE

00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:39.503
TOTAL COST OF OF THIS.

00:45:39.570 --> 00:45:41.638
THAT IS ONE OF THE ESTIMATES

00:45:41.705 --> 00:45:43.307
THAT'S PROVIDED OKAY.

00:45:43.373 --> 00:45:44.708
AND THEN.

00:45:44.775 --> 00:45:46.076
I'VE BEEN A BIG FAN OF THE

00:45:46.143 --> 00:45:48.245
EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT -- IN

00:45:48.312 --> 00:45:50.080
FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY

00:45:50.147 --> 00:45:51.415
OF THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT --

00:45:51.482 --> 00:45:54.084
IT IT WAS -- A REPUBLICAN IDEA

00:45:54.151 --> 00:45:56.753
MIGHT CONCEPT -- IS IS THAT IF

00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.655
YOU GET PEOPLE WORKING AND YOU

00:45:58.722 --> 00:46:00.124
GET THEM TO BE PRODUCTIVE ANY

00:46:00.190 --> 00:46:02.526
BEGIN SET OF EYES -- THAT THAT

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:04.361
WORK AND THEN AT SOME POINT IN

00:46:04.428 --> 00:46:06.263
TIME THEY'LL BE ENOUGH RESOURCES

00:46:06.330 --> 00:46:07.865
WHERE THEY WOULD NEED ANYMORE A

00:46:07.931 --> 00:46:09.066
GOVERNMENTAL.

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.601
ASSISTANCE -- I THINK THAT

00:46:10.667 --> 00:46:13.604
THAT'S A A LAUDABLE GOAL.

00:46:13.670 --> 00:46:16.173
I'M I'M THINKING -- IN MY HEAD

00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.842
IN REGARDS TO TO THIS.

00:46:18.909 --> 00:46:19.376
WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:46:19.443 --> 00:46:22.112
IMMIGRATION STATUS BECAUSE -- IF

00:46:22.179 --> 00:46:23.747
IF YOU'VE GOT INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:46:23.814 --> 00:46:25.249
ARE HERE.

00:46:25.315 --> 00:46:27.151
WHETHER THEY ARE BOMB DOCUMENTED

00:46:27.217 --> 00:46:29.386
OR UNDOCUMENTED BUT THEY DO NOT

00:46:29.453 --> 00:46:31.655
HAVE A SOUL SECURITY HOW DO WE

00:46:31.722 --> 00:46:32.322
KNOW HOW LONG THAT THEY'RE GOING

00:46:32.389 --> 00:46:33.323
TO BE.

00:46:33.390 --> 00:46:35.058
IN THIS COUNTRY ARE THEY GOING

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:36.860
TO BE HERE FOR ONE YEAR TWO

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:38.695
YEARS THREE YEARS FIVE YEARS OF

00:46:38.762 --> 00:46:39.997
THE INTEND TO STAY.

00:46:40.063 --> 00:46:41.131
AND SO PART OF THIS WHEN YOU'RE

00:46:41.198 --> 00:46:42.933
THINKING ABOUT THE COST OF THIS

00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.538
THIS PROGRAM -- IS IT IS IT AT

00:46:47.604 --> 00:46:48.639
SOME POINT IN TIME YOU HAVE TO

00:46:48.705 --> 00:46:50.040
START A FACTOR THESE OTHER THESE

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:51.608
OTHER THINGS AND AND SO I'M JUST

00:46:51.675 --> 00:46:53.544
WONDERING IF ANY -- ANALYSIS HAS

00:46:53.610 --> 00:46:55.345
BEEN DONE THAT IF WE WERE GOING

00:46:55.412 --> 00:46:57.147
TO BE -- SPENDING FOUR HUNDRED

00:46:57.214 --> 00:46:59.049
AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS IF THERE

00:46:59.116 --> 00:47:01.652
IS GOING TO BE A RETURN ON ON

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:02.452
THAT INVESTMENT.

00:47:02.519 --> 00:47:03.453
CLEARLY I THINK THE RETURN ON

00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.923
THE INVESTMENT IS THE WORK.

00:47:05.989 --> 00:47:07.791
OR THE TAXES THAT ARE BEING PAID

00:47:07.858 --> 00:47:12.129
BY THE IMMIGRANTS -- THATWOULD

00:47:12.196 --> 00:47:13.997
BE ONE OF THEM -- ONE YOU'RE

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.999
TALKING ABOUT HOW LONG THEY'RE

00:47:16.066 --> 00:47:17.534
GOING TO STAY I'M NOT SURE.

00:47:17.601 --> 00:47:20.437
IF I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION.

00:47:20.504 --> 00:47:21.805
I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT WE HAVE

00:47:21.872 --> 00:47:22.472
ASKED HOW LONG THEY'RE GOING TO

00:47:22.539 --> 00:47:24.208
SUPPORT AND THE REASON I I SAY

00:47:24.274 --> 00:47:26.143
THAT IS THIS IS NOT A NORMAL TAX

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.511
CREDIT THIS IS A REFUNDABLE

00:47:27.578 --> 00:47:28.445
CREDIT.

00:47:28.512 --> 00:47:30.080
WHICH MEANS IT'S A CREDIT YOU

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:31.715
KNOW IF YOUR TAXABLE IF YOU'RE

00:47:31.782 --> 00:47:33.617
TO TAX THE TAX CONSEQUENCES WERE

00:47:33.684 --> 00:47:34.685
TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS YOU COULD

00:47:34.751 --> 00:47:36.320
GET A CREDIT OF FIVE OR SIX

00:47:36.386 --> 00:47:37.287
HUNDRED DOLLARS.

00:47:37.354 --> 00:47:38.655
SO IT'S ACTUALLY MORE THAN WHAT

00:47:38.722 --> 00:47:40.657
YOU'D BE PAYING AND FOR TAXES SO

00:47:40.724 --> 00:47:41.758
PART OF THAT AGAIN IS AN

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:43.460
INCENTIVE TO TRY TO GET FOLKS TO

00:47:43.527 --> 00:47:46.129
BE ABLE. TO TO WORK -- AND SO

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.197
THERE'S THERE HAS TO BE SOME

00:47:47.264 --> 00:47:49.199
SORT OF QUANTITATIVE ANALYSIS

00:47:49.266 --> 00:47:50.601
DONE HERE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:47:50.667 --> 00:47:53.837
INTENT OF THIS PROGRAM -- IS IS

00:47:53.904 --> 00:47:56.940
IS GOING TOWARDS -- THAT THE

00:47:57.007 --> 00:47:58.108
ULTIMATE GOAL.

00:47:58.175 --> 00:48:00.210
IF I MAY UM SO THE FOUR HUNDRED

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.511
MILLION DOLLAR ESTIMATE OF THE

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.080
COST IS FOR THE CURRENT KILEY

00:48:03.146 --> 00:48:04.414
ITC STRUCTURE.

00:48:04.481 --> 00:48:06.149
THERE HAVE BEEN ESTIMATES MADE

00:48:06.216 --> 00:48:07.618
ABOUT THE COST OF INCLUDE

00:48:07.684 --> 00:48:09.253
REMOVING THE EXCLUSION FOR AYE

00:48:09.319 --> 00:48:10.520
TEN FILERS THAT'S ACTUALLY A

00:48:10.587 --> 00:48:12.456
RELATIVELY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:14.758
THE TOTAL COST OF KELLY I. T. C..

00:48:14.825 --> 00:48:16.727
SO THAT'S ONE THING THE SECOND

00:48:16.793 --> 00:48:18.929
THING IS THAT I I TEN NUMBERS

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:21.198
ARE RENEWABLE SO IT'S NOT LIKE

00:48:21.265 --> 00:48:23.734
YOU ARE AND I TEN FILER AND YOU

00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.868
HAVE THAT I TO NUMBER

00:48:24.935 --> 00:48:26.570
NECESSARILY FOR YOUR WHOLE LIFE.

00:48:26.637 --> 00:48:28.138
AS YOU NATURALIZE AND BECOME A

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.039
CITIZEN AND GET A SOCIAL

00:48:29.106 --> 00:48:30.874
SECURITY NUMBER YOU CAN USE THAT

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.476
SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER TO FILE

00:48:32.542 --> 00:48:34.845
YOUR TAXES BUT IT IS A RENEWABLE

00:48:34.911 --> 00:48:36.280
NUMBER SO IT'S NOT AND IT IS

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:38.715
SOMETHING THAT GETS EVALUATED.

00:48:38.782 --> 00:48:40.684
BUT OF THOSE I TO THOSE FOLKS

00:48:40.751 --> 00:48:41.451
WILL BE FILING WITH AN AYE TEN

00:48:41.518 --> 00:48:43.520
NUMBER HOW MANY OF THEM END UP

00:48:43.587 --> 00:48:45.055
STAYING IN THIS -- STAYING IN

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.323
THE COUNTRY AND BECOME

00:48:46.390 --> 00:48:47.858
NATURALIZED.

00:48:47.924 --> 00:48:51.328
I DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION

00:48:51.395 --> 00:48:52.095
FOR YOU BUT OKAY.

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:53.397
I DO THINK THERE IS SOME

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:54.531
RESEARCH THEY NAME THE AVERAGE

CARIBBEAN AND WHAT I WOULD ALSO

01:11:08.731 --> 01:11:10.466
NOTE IS BECAUSE EDUCATION

TRANSPORTATION ALLOCATION IS

01:11:39.194 --> 01:11:40.596
