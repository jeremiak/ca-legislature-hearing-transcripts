GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR IN THE MORNING COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT TODAY AT MADAM CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- SP THREE OF SEVEN IS A CRITICAL BILL THAT SEEKS TO STOP ONE OF THE LARGEST ENVIRONMENTAL THREATS THAT THE STATE IS SEEN. IN THE NORTH COAST WILL BE WITNESSING INDICATES. A PROPOSAL FROM A CLANDESTINE OPERATION HIDING BEHIND ANONYMOUS LLC OUT OF WYOMING. THEY WANT TO SHIP MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF TONS OF COAL. THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF CALIFORNIA. INTO THE BAY AREA. AND THEN UP INTO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE COUNTIES OF MARIN SONOMA MENDOCINO AND HUMBOLDT. THAT CALL WITHIN BE SHIPPED TO ASIAN MARKETS THROUGH THE PORT OF HUMBLE. SPECIFICALLY SP THREE OH SEVEN WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA PREVENTING ALL STATE FUNDING FROM GOING TO THIS INITIATIVE. TO BE ABLE TO BLOCK IMPROVEMENTS ON THE NOW DEFUNCT NORTH COAST RAIL LINE NORTH OF THE CITY OF WILLITS. FURTHER ADVANCE STATE MONEY FROM BEING SPENT ON THE BUILD OUT OF ANY NEW BOOK CALLED TERMINAL-FACILITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY OF HUMBLE. NOW THIS ISSUE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN THE LEGISLATURE FOR VET MAY SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU SIMILAR LEGISLATION WAS PASSED- N. IMPACTED SENATOR SKINNER'S DISTRICT. WIND THEN SENATOR HANCOCK BROUGHT FORWARD SENATE BILL TWELVE SEVENTY NINE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. THAT ALSO BLOCK FUNDING WHEN A TOXIC COAL TRAIN COAL TERMINAL PROPOSED FOR THE PORT OF OAKLAND. THIS PROPOSED TAX A COAL TRAIN MOVING TO CURRENT DAY IS AN ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER IN THE MAKING. THE MIDWEST COAL THAT WOULD TRAVEL THROUGH THIS YEAR'S ACROSS THE GOLDEN STATE THROUGH THE HERT OF THRIVING COMMUNITIES ANCIENT REDWOODS STATE AND NATIONAL WILD LANDS IT WOULD ALSO RUN ALONG THE RUSSIAN IN YOUR RIVERS WHICH ARE THE MAIN SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER FOR NEARLY ONE MILLION RESIDENTS. IT'S CRUCIAL THAT WE STOP THIS DANGEROUS OPERATION COAL IS THE MOST DAMAGING SOURCE AND ENERGY ON THE PLANET IT'S THE NUMBER ONE CONTRIBUTOR HANDS DOWN. TO OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. WINDBER COAL SPEWS MRGREEN THE ATMOSPHERE TO BE RAINED DOWN UPON OUR COASTS AND WATERWAYS WERE ACCUMULATES IN FISH. POISONING PEOPLE WILDLIFE. ALLOWING INTENSIVE COAL SHIPMENTS ALONG AS ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE HABITAT WOULD BE INCONSISTENT TORE STATES INVESTMENTS IN MOVING TOWARDS MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. THE TOXIC COAL TRAIN IS OFFICIALLY OPPOSED BY THE COUNTIES OF HUMBOLDT MENDOCINO SONOMA AND MARIN THE VAST MAJORITY CITIES ALONG THE CORRIDOR INCLUDING INCLUDING THE CITY SANTA ROSA. CITY PETALUMA CITY WILLITS CITY YOU CHI AND THE CITY OF EUREKA AMONG OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE SIERRA CLUB HUMBLE BEE KEEPER AND THE RUSSIAN. EVER THE RUSSIAN RIVERKEEPER. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY AT LEAST YOU'RE HARMON SHE'S EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF FRIENDS OF THE EEL RIVER WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT MRS HAYMAN IS WITH US ALONG WITH DANIEL BRAND REPRESENTING THIS YEAR. MANAGER WISH FOR CLASS WHEN I VOTED THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE NINETY YOU'VE WORKED ON THIS FOR SOME TIME SO WE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. SO WE'LL FIRST START OFF WITH- MISS HAMMOND WITH FRIENDS OF THE EEL RIVER I BELIEVE SHE MAY BE ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS IMPORTANT MATTER TODAY- MY NAME IS LISA HAMMOND I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR FRIENDS OF THE EEL RIVER AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. OF SB THREE OF FIVE AND- LIKE SENATOR MCGUIRE SAID THE BILL WOULD PREVENT ANY STATE FUNDING FROM GOING TO HELP COAL COMPANIES TRANSPORT COAL ON THE NTRA RAIL RIGHT OF. WAY FROM- OR FROM HER HUMBLE HARBOR. HEALER CAN'T IN- PUT SIMPLY JUST NOT AN APPROPRIATE LOCATION FOR A RAILROAD WHEN IT WAS LAST OPERATED OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THE NORTHWESTERN PACIFIC RAILROAD. WAS PRONE TO FREQUENT DERAILMENTS- THE EVIDENCE THAT MAY STILL LIE IN THE RIVER AND IT WAS THE MOST EXPENSIVE LINE IN THE NATION TO MAINTAIN. RESTORING RAIL SERVICE TO THE EEL RIVER CANYON WOULD DEVASTATE THE PROGRESS MADE TOWARDS FISHERIES RESTORATION AND REMEDIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HARM ON THE RAILROAD. IF YOU HAD CALLED IN THE EQUATION- RESIDENTS ON THE NORTH COAST WOULD BE SUBJECT TO POISONED AIR AND WATER. THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF WHOLE TRANSPORTATION AND STORAGE ON PUBLIC HEALTH. REALLY CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED. BECAUSE OF I THINK ME ABOUT THE IS THE MIDDLE OF THE PROGRESS. IN RESTORATION OF THE NORTH TO AND FISHERIES. AND FRIENDS WOULD BE AWARE OF AT SUPPORT THE BILL AND WE'RE WORKING REALLY HARD TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STOP THE PRACTICAL TRAINING SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. IN VERY MUCH FOR TESTIMONY MISS HAMMOND. WE WILL NOW MOVE TO THE SECOND SO A WITNESS IN SUPPORT MR. DANIEL BARRETT WITH SIERRA CLUB. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS DANIEL BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA AND- AFTER MILLION MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WERE INSTRUCTED. AT AT B. THREE OH SEVEN. STILL IT'S KEY TO PROTECTING NORTH COAST COMMUNITIES WATER SAID YOU GOT THAT DONE AND WHILE BUYERS FROM A BILLION DOLLAR TOXIC PLANNED. AND THAT WAS DEVELOPED IN SECRET BY COAL COMPANY IN THE MIDWEST TO SHIP COAL THROUGH THE NORTH COAST. WE'VE ALSO KNOWN FOR DECADES THAT BURNING CALL HAD TO REJECT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT AND THEY MASTERED CONTRIBUTOR TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS. CALIFORNIA CANNOT BE A LEADER ON CLEAN AIR AND CLIMATE AND ALSO FACILITATE THE COMBUSTION OF FOSSIL FUEL THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AGAIN SIERRA CLUB STRONGLY SUPPORTS AT B. THREE F.

I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME THANK YOU MODERATOR WE'VE CONCLUDED SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WE WILL NOT TAKE THE DISCUSSION BACK TO MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS. ON THE FLOOR FOR SP THREE OH SEVEN SENATOR TO LEFT YES I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY. STATING THAT MY SUPPORT FOR SB THREE OH SEVEN THE KNOWLEDGE TO WORK THAT THE AUTHOR IS DONE- MY COLLEAGUE IS DONE INTENSIVE RESEARCH AND IT'S BEEN ON THIS FOR I THINK THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR ON THIS. BUT I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND CONCERN AND THAT IS THAT IF WE PASS SB THREE OH SEVEN BECOMES LAW. AND WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE ROAD WHEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SAYS THEY THEY NEED THAT RAIL SYSTEM- WILL THIS BE ABLE TO STOP THAT THAT IS MY QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA- SENATOR MCGUIRE WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND OUR CHURCH AT THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES OKAY GENERAL MANAGER ABSOLUTELY GO RIGHT AHEAD THANK YOU SO MUCH AND SHARING THANK YOU SO MUCH- SYNERGY LETTER FOR THE GREAT QUESTION. SO FEDERAL REGULATION PREMIUMS ALL STATE REGULATION. RAILROADS ARE FEDERALLY REGULATED UTILITY- AND HERE'S WHERE WE'RE AT. WE WERE MOVING FORWARD WITH AN APPLICATION BUT THE SURFACE TRANSPORTATION BOARD IN WASHINGTON DC. I LIKE TO RAIL BANK THE LINE. WELL IT'S- ALL THE WAY UP TO HUMBLE SOME. RAILED IS APPROVED BY THE SERVER TRANSPORTATION BOARD THAT OVERSEES ALL FREIGHT RAIL FOR- THE UNITED STATES. IF AT ANY TIME THERE IS A VIABLE ENTITY. AS FAR AS A FREIGHT RAIL OPERATION THAT WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION THE TRAIL BACK TO RAIL. BY LAW WE WOULD HAVE TO DO SO. I SINCE THE RAIL BANKING ACT WAS PASSED BY CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND MILES OF FREIGHT RAILS BEING TRANSITIONED INTO TRAILS. LESS THAN TWENTY MILES OF THAT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TOTAL HAS EVER BEEN TRANSITION BACK FROM TRAIL TO RAIL. THERE IS NOT BEEN A VIABLE FREIGHT ENTITY ON THE NORTH COAST SINCE THIS WAS SHUT DOWN IN THE EARLY NINETIES. AS WE HEARD FROM OUR WITNESSES THE LAST TRAIN THAT WENT UP THE RIVER CANYON THAT HAS SOME OF THE MOST GEOLOGIC. GEOLOGICALLY UNSTABLE SOILS ON EARTH. RAIL CARS STILL REMAIN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE RIVER THERE WERE WASHED OUT FOM THE LINE BY ELAINE SIDE ANOTHER FREIGHT RAIL GO UP THE RIVER CANYON IT WILL LITERALLY TAKE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MOST LIKELY WELL OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO FIX UP THE YOU'LL RIVER CANYON SECTION AND THE SEVEN SECTIONS FOR A VIABLE FREIGHT OPERATOR. AND IT SIMPLY WON'T MAKE THE CUT WHEN IT COMES TO FINANCES. THANK YOU FOR DEREGULATING THAT AND I THINK THAT WAS MY POINT TO BE ABLE TO- HAVE YOU EXPRESS THE DANGER OF THE RAIL COMING BACK. SO WITH THAT I URGE- AND I VOTE ON SB THREE OH SEVEN THANK YOU AND- ARCHULETA PUSHING THAT A SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU CHAIR- I WANTED TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORTH BILL- WE KNOW THAT. COAL USE OVERALL IN THE UNITED STATES IS DROPPED MMHM WHILE CALIFORNIA CLEARLY HAS A ELECTRICITY GENERATION IN OTHER STATES DON'T EVEN THOUGH OTHER STATES DON'T. COAL BASED GENERATION OF ELECTRICITY HAS BEEN DROPPING ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES WHICH IT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD SO OF COURSE. ONE OF THE ONLY MARKETS FOR COAL IS EXTERNALLY AND- SINCE WE ARE CLEAR THAT IT IS ONE OF THE MOST SERIOUS POLLUTANTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS WE DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO BE ASSISTING. HAVING OUR POOL GOING ELSEWHERE AND BEING BURNT MEANINGFUL IN GENERATED IN NORTH AMERICA SO. I THINK IT IS A VERY WISE- BILL. IN ADDITION TO ITS PROTECTION OF THE NORTH COAST AND AS THE SENATOR POINTED OUT A SIMILAR ACTION WAS TAKEN TO PREVENT A COAL DEPOT FROM THE PORT OF AKLAND FOR THE SAME REASON IT WOULD'VE BEEN COAL GENERATED ELSEWHERE AND SOLD THEM TO ASIA. SO WITH THAT I WILL MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF PUTTING ASIDE ALL THE DISCUSSIONS ON COAL HAVE WE AS A STATE- OTHER LEGISLATION EVER HAD A BILL THAT WOULD PROHIBIT ANY STATE MONEY FROM BEING USED TO REHABILITATE. EXISTING FACILITIES OR OPERATIONS AS ITS STAFF REPORT AND CONCEPT INCLUDING A RAILYARD OR RAIL IF ANY RAIL INFRASTRUCTURE I GET THE I GET THE REAL BANKING I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT WE'RE DOING MORE THAN THAT MORE THAN JUST CALL WE'RE SAYING WE'LL NEVER SPEND ANY MONEY ON ANY OF THESE FACILITIES HAVE WE EVER DONE THAT TO THE AUTHORS. KNOWLEDGE SENATOR MCGUIRE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INTER THANK YOU SIR BYE CASKEY UNFORTUNATELY FEDERAL LAW DOES NOT ALLOW THE STATE. IN YOUR LOCAL ENTITIES TO BE ABLE TO SINGLE OUT- INDIVIDUAL USES OF A RAIL. FOR EXAMPLE COAL AND OIL IT'S ALL OR NOTHING. AND THAT IS WHY IT IS STATED AS SUCH IN THE BILL. UNDER THE PREVIOUS BILL IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHEN THEN SENATOR HANCOCK ADVANCED HER BILL. IT WAS VERY FOCUSED ON THE ISSUE OF COAL TERMINALS- BUT- THERE IS AN ACTIVE RAIL LINE IN THE PORT AROUND IN AND AROUND THE PORT OF OAKLAND THERE IS NOT BEEN AN ACTIVE RAIL LINES IN THIS STRETCH FOR. WELL SINCE BEFORE I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL SO THIRTY YEARS AGO- IN SO THAT IS WHY WE ARE FOCUSED ON RAIL IN IN JUST BEING CANDID ABOUT IT THERE IS NO WAY IN HELL. A FREE RAIL LINE WILL EVER START AGAIN. THROUGH THE RIVER CANYON IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE AND THE BUSINESS SIMPLY IS NOT THERE IN FACT WE'VE TALKED WITH A HALF DOZEN FREIGHT OPERATORS THAT SINCE WE STARTED. ON THE GREAT RED BETRAYAL OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND NO ONE CAN MAKE THE BUSINESS CASE TO BE ABLE TO MAKE THE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL LITERALLY DID BE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- AND- THE FREE OPERATION SIMPLY IS NOT THERE TO SUSTAIN. ANY TYPE OF- FUTURE FREIGHT RAIL. OKAY I MEAN I THINK THAT I JUST WANT. TO SO IF I UNDERSTAND IN ORDER TO GET THE PROBATION ON THE WHOLE ELEMENT ON THE LINE YOU HAVE TO SAY THAT THE STATE WILL PUT NO MONEY INTO ANY REAL PREPARATION WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM THE HANCOCK BILL BECAUSE- TECHNICALLY YOU COULD STILL RUN HOLD UP AND DOWN THE LINE YOU JUST COULDN'T GET IT TO THE TERMINAL THAT WAS THE- THAT WAS THE DIFFERENCE. I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IS I HAVEN'T SAID THIS IS THE CONTINUOUS LINE SO I UNDERSTAND THE EAGLE RIVER AS IT CROSSES THROUGH THE DIFFERENT SECTIONS HERE BUT LET'S SAY IS A MINOR IS YOUR INFIRM DALE AND THE LINE GOES TO ARCADE AND SOMEBODY WANTS TO USE THAT LINE. THEY ARE UNDER THE FEDERAL SYSTEM THEY COULD. AND AGAIN I DON'T SEE IT ECONOMICALLY MAKING SENSE RIGHT NOW BUT IN THE FUTURE THEY COULD GO INTO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. UNDER THERE ARE REAL BANKING GIVEN EXEMPTION TO DO THAT UNDER THIS LEGISLATION NO STATE FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO. REHABILITATE THE RAIL YARD FOR ANY OF THE FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE TO BE. A FUTURE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH IT. YOU'RE CORRECT SIR ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR WHITE HOUSEKEEPING HE SAID REQUIRED WE HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION FROM SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- I REALLY JUST HAVE A COMMENT MORE THAN IT QUESTION I I'VE BEEN IN FAVOR OF RAIL BANKING FOR SOME TIME I BELIEVE THAT- IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THE CORRIDOR INTACT- WE CAN MAKE TRAILS OUT OF THEN WE CAN DO WHATEVER BUT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW WHEN. WE'RE NOT HERE. MAYBE THERE IS SOME OTHER. USE FOR THAT CORRIDOR AND IT WOULD BE MAINTAINED. BUT THIS BILL IS MORE ABOUT. THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE AS THE STATE LOOKS AT IT THOSE THOSE DETERMINATIONS WILL BE DONE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. ON HOW THOSE RAIL BASE WILL BE USED SO FOR THIS BILL I'M I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY AND THE REASON BEING IS THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO SPEND ANY OF THE RESOURCES THAT ARE AVALABLE TO CALIFORNIANS THERE'S A LOT BETTER PLACES THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING OUR RESOURCES ON- WE JUST. NO DURING THE BREAK WE HAD THE- PORTS ANALYSIS I KNOW MANY OF YOU WERE THERE. WE TALKED ABOUT GETTING A RAIL LINE FROM THE PORTS IN SAN DIEGO OUT TO THE INLAND EMPIRE WHICH WOULD. REDUCE TRAFFIC IN OUR INNER CITIES AND ACTUALLY DO GOOD CARBON WORK. REDUCING CARBON SO THOSE ARE THE AREAS THAT I THINK THAT- IF CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE SPENDING RESOURCESWE SHOULD BE FOCUSING THOSE RESOURCES ON AREAS WHERE WE KNOW WE CAN. REDUCE TRUCK TRAFFIC IN OUR INNER CITIES AND PORTS. AND PUT RAIL LINES OUT TO- YOU KNOW INTERMODAL SYSTEMS THAT- WE WORK OUTSIDE OF OUR CITY SO THAT'S THE REASON I'LL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL- IN THE FUTURE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GONNA COME WE'LL KEEP THAT. REAL BANK TO WHERE IT SHOULD BE PEOPLE CAN HIKE THAT HAS A TRAIL FOR NOW BUT IN THE FUTURE IF IT WANTED TO BE USED FOR- FEDERAL- ASSESS. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY I THINK WE ALREADY HAVE A MOTION FROM SENATOR SKINNER BUT I WOULD CONCUR AS WALLICH MET MOST OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT- I'D LIKE TO SAY THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS FOR FOUR PLUS YEARS- IT'S CERTAINLY- WELL WORTH- THE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSION AND CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE THE PROCESS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS WELL SO WITH THAT WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THEIR TERRACE ON TAKE A MOMENT SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SINCERE AND DIRECT ENGAGEMENT AT YOUR AMAZING STAFF TEAM. FOR THEIR SINCERE AND DIRECT ENGAGEMENT- INTO THIS COMMITTEE FOR THE CONVERSATION TODAY CENTER TO LET OUR DENNIS SKINNER SONORA CASKETS DOLLARS OUT FOR THIS CONVERSATION IT WOULD BE GRATEFUL TO HAVE YOUR SUPPORT TO BE TO STOP THE TOXIC CULTURING.
