REGULATORY LEGISLATIVE EFFORTS BY HAVE IMPROVE THE MANY FACETS OF INTEGRITY TRANSPARENCY WELFARE AND SAFETY WHILE AFFORDING IT'S REQUIRED IN HUMAN PARTICIPANTS THE MOST PROTECTION POSSIBLE WHETHER AMTRAK SAFETY. MEDICATION STANDARDS DRUG TESTING OR RESEARCH. THE LAST SIXTEEN MONTHS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR CALIFORNIA'S HORSE RACING INDUSTRY FROM THE USUAL INCREASE IN FATALITIES THAT OCCURRED IN THE EARLY TWENTY NINETEEN TO THE RECENT ECONOMIC HARDSHIP CAUSED BY THE CURRENT PANDEMIC. BUT IN BOTH CASES THE INDUSTRY FACES CHALLENGES HEAD ON WITH DETERMINATION AND RESOLVE. IN RESPONSE TO THE RECENT SAFETY CRISIS CALIFORNIA'S RACING INDUSTRY IN THE CALIFORNIA HORSE RACING BOARD ADOPTED STRINGENT RULES REGULATIONS AND PROTOCOLS. FOR MEDICATION REFORM ADVANCE VETERINARIAN SCREENING TRACK MAINTENANCE INCLUDING SPECIAL MEASURES DURING RAIN OR EXTREME WEATHER CONDITIONS AND THE USE OF HIGH TECH DIAGNOSTIC EQUIPMENT INCLUDING PTN MRI MACHINES. THESE WIDE RANGING CHANGES AND PROTOCOLS OF LEAD TO SAFER RACING AFTER THE SPIKE IN FATAL BREAK DOWN TO SANTA ANITA DURING THE TWENTY NINETEEN RACE MAY. I MUST NOTE THAT ALL THESE EFFORTS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION. BUT NOT THE TOTAL ELIMINATION OF COURSE FIDELITY'S. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A RECENTLY RELEASED C. H. R. B.
