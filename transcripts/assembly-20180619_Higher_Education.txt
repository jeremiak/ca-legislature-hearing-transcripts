I AND THE INTO TEACHING CAREERS BUT THEY ARE ALL IN LOCATIONS WHERE THERE IS A A CS YOU. FOR PRIVATE INSTITUTION AND A COMMITTEE COLLEGE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY.

NINE SIXTY EIGHT REQUIRES THE COMMUNICABLE JUST A STATE COLLEGES TO MEET A RATIO OF ONE LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR TO EVERY ONE THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS. UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA IS ENCOURAGED TO MEET THE SAME RATIO AS BE NINE SIXTY EIGHT HOPES TO REMEDY THE GENERAL LACK OF CONSISTENT REPORTING THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM THE MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS BY REQUIRING EACH CAMPUS REPORT THE LEGISLATURE EVERY THREE YEARS. THROUGH THE USE OF A SURVEY AND REPORT ANNUAL ATTEMPTED SUICIDE DATA WINNER STAND THAT THE BOARD BEHAVIOR SCIENCES WOULD LIKE TO COUNT ASSOCIATES AND TRAINEES TOWARD THE RATIO. ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT S. B. NINE SIXTY EIGHT DOES NOT LIMIT THE CS USE ABILITY TO LIMIT PAID OR UNPAID ASSOCIATES ARE TRAINEES THIS BILL ONLY SET THE MANY M. A MINIMUM RATIO FOR LICENSED MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS. MIGHT AS MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS ALSO ALREADY HAVE A HIGH CASELOAD AND SUPERVISING ASSOCIATES AND TRAINEES ADD TO THAT -- WE WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT BY ADDING ASSOCIATES TRAINEES THE CAMPUS IS WOULD BRING THEM. ON IS EITHER CHEAPER LABOR FREE LABOR WE DO NOT WANT TO ACTUALLY DECREASE ACCESS TO LICENSE MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELORS WHAT THE SAME TIME I INCREASING THE CURRENT MENTAL HEALTH COUNSELOR WORKLOAD. THERE'S A GROWING NEED FOR A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND S. B. NINE SIXTY ADDRESSES THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS FACING CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WHILE ALSO GIVING US THE INFORMATION NEEDED TO CONTINUE. GIVING THE CARE OUR STUDENTS DESERVE AS BENIGN SIXTY IT HAS BIPARTISAN SUPPORT NO OPPOSITION FORM OPPOSITION I SPECT WE ASK FOR AND I THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN SUPPORT GOOD AFTER. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEDINA AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ON HIGHER EDUCATION I'M DOCTOR MIMI BOMBER SPOCK I'M A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST FROM CHICO STATE UNIVERSITY. AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. COUNSELING CENTERS IN THE CSU ARE CHRONICALLY UNDERSTAFFED WE NEED S. B. NINE SIXTY EIGHT TO ENSURE OUR STUDENTS ARE SAFE AND ARE STAYING ON TRACK TO GRADUATE. ANXIETY AND DEPRESSION ARE RAMPANT AND INCREASING AMONG COLLEGE STUDENTS BOTH HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE NATION. STUDIES SHOW THAT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS SEEKING A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES IS UP 30%. MANY STUDENTS PRESENT IN CRISIS UNABLE TO FUNCTION AND WE CAN AND MUST DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS. S. B. NINE SIXTY EIGHT IS ABOUT ADEQUATE STUDENT COUNCIL RATIOS. THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COUNSELING SERVICES THE ACCREDITING BODY FOR COLLEGE COUNSELING CENTERS RECOMMENDS A MINIMUM OF ONE COUNSELOR MINIMUM. YET IN THE CSU ON SEVERAL CAMPUS WE HAVE ONE CANCER 430-002-4000 STUDENTS. THIS UNDER STAFFING IS REAL AND IT IS DANGEROUS. SEVEN SUICIDES OCCURRED ON ONE OF THESE UNDERSTAFFED CAMPUSES DURING THE PAST WINTER QUARTER. TREATMENT IS EFFECTIVE YET COUNSELORS IN THE CSU ARE STRUGGLING TO BE SURE STUDENTS ARE GETTING THE TREATMENT THEY NEED. HIGH RISK STUDENTS ARE PRIORITIZED BUT THAT LEAVES MANY WAITING FOR HELP. STUDENTS WAIT WEEKS AND SOMETIMES MONTHS FOR TREATMENT AND BY THEN STUDENTS TELL US IT'S OFTEN TOO LATE. I AM VERY TROUBLED BY THE STORIES FROM STUDENTS I MET AND THE CAMPUSES AND DURING RECENT VISITS AND THEY ARE IMPLORING US DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THOSE STUDENTS. IGNORING THE STUDENT MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS MUST STOP WE MUST MEET MINIMUM STAFFING RATIOS RECOMMENDED BY EXPERTS. WE CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE TO SHORT CHANGE STUDENTS WITH MENTAL HEALTH NEEDS WE KNOW FROM RESEARCH THAT PROVIDING ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES PAYS FOR ITSELF. WE KNOW THAT COUNSELING LOWERS DROPOUT RATES ENHANCES GRADUATION RATES AND CONTRIBUTES TO THE FINANCIAL WELL BEING OF FAMILIES IN CALIFORNIA AND BEYOND. I URGE AWAY THE REAL COSTS OF IGNORING SUCH AN OBVIOUS SOLUTION MANAGEABLE AND SAFE COUNSELOR TO STUDENT STAFFING RATIOS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF SB. NINE SIXTY EIGHT GOOD AFTERNOON -- COMMITTEE CHAIR MEDINA AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS GEORGE RUSSO -- THE ASSISTANT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CAL STATE SENATE SOCIO XIN. I'M WE'RE THANKFUL FOR SENATOR PANS CFA. AND LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. SINCE THEN THE CAL STATE SYSTEM HAVE A HOST OF ISSUES THAT THEY'RE DEALING WITH RIGHT NOW HOMELESSNESS FOOD INSECURITY -- AND THE POLITICAL CLIMATE AND THIS COURSE HAVE CREATED AND A NUMBER OF ENVIRONMENTAL CHALLENGES FOR STUDENTS MENTAL HEALTH -- THAT ISN'T NOW CONSTANTLY BEING CHALLENGED. IN FACT THE ISSUE OF MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ON OUR CAMPUSES HAS BECOME THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY OF OUR STUDENTS IN THE CSU. EACH YEAR CSSA -- CREATES A POLICY AGENDA TO GUIDE OUR STUDENTS WORK FOR THE YEAR THIS YEAR THOSE FOR POLICY PRIORITIES WERE MENTAL HEALTH. AFFORDABILITY SAFE INCLUSIVE ENVIRONMENTS AND EQUITY IN STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT -- AZERSUN LEADERS WERE CONSULTING WITH THE ASSISTANCE AT LARGE THEY FOUND THAT THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY THE ISSUE THAT OUR STUDENTS CARED MOST ABOUT WAS MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ON CAMPUSES MORE SO THAN AFFORDABILITY. MORE SO THAN ANY OTHER ISSUE. AND IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND WHY THIS IS BECOME SUCH A PRESSING ISSUE ON OUR CAMPUSES JUST UNDER HALF OF OUR TWENTY THREE CSU CAMPUSES HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH. COUNSELOR TO STUDENT RATIO THAT IS -- NEAR OR BELOW THE PROPOSED RATIO IN S. B. NINE SIXTY EIGHT SMITH ON A MAJORITY A CAMPUS IS STUDENTS ARE REPORTING SIGNIFICANT WAIT TIMES TO SEE A COUNSELOR. SOMETIMES UP TO A MONTH AND CAPS ON HOW MANY TIMES THEY CAN SEE A COUNSELOR AND YEAR SOMETIMES AS LOW AS FIVE TIMES PER YEAR -- THAT'S WHY PASSING S. B. NINE SUCCEEDED SO CRUCIAL IN A STUDENT CAN ACKNOWLEDGE OUR NEED FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT NEARLY A MONTH. TO SEE SOMEONE ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE FACT THAT MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CAN PRESENT REAL IMMEDIATE SAFETY CHALLENGES FOR STUDENTS IN THE STUDENTS AROUND THEM -- ADDITIONALLY ON ALL CAMPUSES TO INFUSE ARE BEING USED TO PAY FOR THESE MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES THIS MEANS THAT THE MOST OBVIOUS WAY TO EXPAND MENTAL HEALTH RESOURCES ON CAMPUSES ARE TO INCREASE. I'M STUDENT CAMPUS BASED FEES -- THIS ONLY COMPOUNDS THE CYCLE OF AFFORDABILITY AND MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES THEIR STUDENTS ARE FACING. AND AS OUR SINS ARE STRUGGLING WITH SO MANY BASIC AYE NEEDS ISSUES AS WELL AS THE OVERALL COST TO ATTEND. I EXACERBATING WINE ISSUE -- BY INCREASING BY INCREASING CAMPUS SPACE VIEWS TO SOLVE ANOTHER ONE IS NOT AN ISSUE AT ALL OR IS NOT A SOLUTION AT ALL.

TWENTY THIRTY BUT SOME ESTIMATING A WORKFORCE SHORTAGE OF THIRTY SEVEN THOUSAND AND THESE ARE EXCELLENT CAREER SUCH AS BEING A RESPIRATORY THERAPIST LICENSED VOCATIONAL NURSE. RADIOLOGY TECHNICIAN AND PHARMACY TECHNOLOGIST THESE CAREERS ARE VITAL TO A COMPREHENSIVE CARE TEAM TO SERVER AGING POPULATION. S. B. THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT REQUIRES COMMITTEE COLLEGES AND PRIVATE COLLEGES TO INCLUDE DATA RELATED TO CLINICAL PLACEMENT SITES FOR ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. TO THEIR EXISTING STATE REPORTING THIS MODEST ADDITIONAL REPORTING STEP ONE FORM HOW WE CAN EXPAND ALLIED HEALTH PROGRAMS WHICH ARE DEPENDENT ON CLINICAL SLOTS SO IT'S NOT JUST A MATTER OF BEING IN A CLASSROOM YOU HAVE TO HAVE CLINICAL EXPERIENCE. BY PROVIDING A CLEAR PICTURE OF WHERE THE STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY BEING PLACE FOR THE CURRENT CLINICAL EXPERIENCE AND HOW THESE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS CONTRIBUTE TO STUDENT SUCCESS AND OUTCOMES. UNDERSTANDING THIS TRAINING PIPELINE THIS PARTICULAR IMPORTANCE SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP A DIVERSE WORKFORCE PIPELINE THAT'S REFLECTIVE OF THE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHICS OF OUR STATE. CALIFORNIA'S CURLY FALLING SHORT WITH ONLY 25% THESE PROFESSIONALS BEING LATINO COMPARED 240% LATINO FOR GENERAL POPULATION AND WITHOUT DIVERSE PIPELINE OF HEALTH CARE WORK FOR WORKERS CALIFORNIA WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE DOUBTS BUT CULTURALLY AND LINGUISTICALLY APPROPRIATE. THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS BY THE SENATE OFFICE RESEARCH WIND WHICH IDENTIFIED IN A TWENTY TWELVE REPORT THAT THERE WAS A LACK OF INFORMATION A CLINICAL TRAINING SUPPORTS. THOSE FURTHER RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE LEAD THE CHARGE AND ESTABLISHING A MEANS TO COLLECT CLINICAL PLACEMENT DATA AND EVALUATE SUPPLY AND DEMAND OF CLINICAL TRAINING PROGRAMS. CURRENTLY PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS HAVE ROUGHLY 70% OF THE MARKET SHARE FOR PROGRAMS WHICH ARE DIRECTLY DEPENDENT A CLINICAL PLACEMENT WITH PROVIDERS. THERE'S A COMPELLING PUBLIC INTEREST TO KNOW IF THERE'S A FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENT AS ADVANTAGE IN PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS OVER A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAMS. WITHOUT ADEQUATE DATA EFFECTIVELY ALIGNED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS CLINICAL TRAINING SITES ARE PROJECTED ALLIED HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE DEMANDS OF SHORTAGES CALIFORNIA SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION WILL BE UNABLE TO MEET.

THINK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JONATHAN LIGHTMAN IN BEHALF OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS THE CO SPONSOR OF S. B.. THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT SO WE SEE THREE MAJOR -- ARGUMENTS FOR THE BILL FIRST. IT ALLOWS COLLEGES TO LEARN FROM ONE ANOTHER WOULD IT'S WORKING AT THE PLACEMENT SLOTS AND PROVIDE THEM WITH IDEAS ON HEALTH FACILITIES WHERE STUDENTS CAN BE PLACED. SECONDS AND CONSISTENT WITH THE SENATE OFFICE OF RESEARCH STUDY THE DOCTOR PAN REFERENCE THAT GIVES YOU THE LAWMAKERS. BETTER INSIGHTS INTO WHAT'S HAPPENING ALLOWING YOU TO MAKE INFORMED POLICY DECISIONS MOVING FORWARD. AND FINALLY IT GIVES US A BETTER SENSE OF HOW COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE FARING IN THESE PLACEMENTS LOTS. AS LARGEST PUBLIC SYSTEM OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. SO WE'VE INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES ON DEVELOPING THE STRONG WORKFORCE INITIATIVE AND INCIDENTALLY THE THEY ACTUALLY THAT WERE TOUGH THAT HAPPENED HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH OUR STUDENTS IN THESE HIGH DEMAND AREAS LIKE. ALLIED HEALTH I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. RIGHT NOW WITH CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN. ALRIGHT GO AHEAD ADJUSTING TELECOM AFTER THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AND WE DON'T HAVE AN OFFICIAL POSITION ON THE BILL WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE INTENT WE'VE HEARD. ANECDOTALLY FROM COLLEGES ABOUT THIS ISSUE OF DIFFICULTIES WITH CLINICAL PLACEMENTS. WE THINK THIS BILL GO FORWARD THAT THE QUANTIFY THE PROBLEM WE CAN. FIND SOLUTIONS TO AND WILL CONTINUE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS AROUND THE REPORTING REQUIREMENTS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] TWEETERS [inaudible] OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MAP BACK REPRESENTING CAPS WHICH IS THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF PRIVATE POST SECONDARY SCHOOLS HAVE. BEEN BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE BEFORE BUT JUST AS A REMINDER WE REPRESENT ABOUT TWO HUNDRED INSTITUTIONS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. A WE HAVE MEMBERS IN ALL OF YOUR DISTRICTS. I'M SO AND FORCING WE ARE OPPOSED TO THE BILL WE'VE WE'VE SPOKEN TO THE SENATOR -- ONE WE THINK IT'S DUPLICATIVE AND THERE'S A LOT OF THIS INFORMATION THAT'S REQUIRED IN THIS FORM THAT WE ALREADY PROVIDE. A BOW TO THE STATE TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TO OUR STUDENTS -- BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY WHAT I'VE I'VE HANDED OUT TO YOU IS A SCHOOL PERFORMANCE FACT SHEET TEMPLATE PROVIDED BY THE BUREAU. AS YOU SEE THERE'S NINE PAGES THERE THIS IS THE FORM THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE. I'M AND YOU'LL SEE THAT THERE'S TWO YEARS OF DATA. THE GRADUATION RATE THERE'S DEFAULT RATE -- PERCENTAGE OF BORROWERS THIS IS ALL VERY SPECIFIED INFORMATION THAT A SCHOOL CAN USE TO DETERMINE IF I WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL A YEAR BE. A THIS WAS MANDATED BY THE LEGISLATURE AND RECENTLY THE REGULATIONS WERE FORMALIZED BY THE BUREAU. SO NOW WE'RE GOING TO ADD TO THIS NINE TO TWELVE PAGE DOCUMENT A NUMBER OF THINGS WE'RE GONNA PROVIDE A LIST OF ALL OF OUR CLINICAL SITES. WE TEACH ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY TO A HUNDRED DIFFERENT PROGRAMS SOME OF THESE ARE INDIVIDUAL CLINICAL SITES WHERE A MEDICAL ASSISTANT STUDENT WILL GO TO DOCTOR PANTS OFFICE AND LEARN HOW TO BE A MEDICAL ASSISTANCE DID. IT'S NOT A TEAM OF TEN DOCTORS GOING TO A HOSPITAL IT'S ONE ON ONE EDUCATION AND CLINICAL TRAINING. SO WE HAVE HUNDREDS OF CLINICAL SITES ONE INSTITUTION CAN HAVE HUNDREDS OF CLINICAL SITES. SO THIS NINE PAGE DOCUMENT AT BEST THAT WE'RE GONNA GIVE TO STUDENTS IS GONNA HAVE A LIST OF DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF SITES. WE ALSO CONDEMN GOING TO PROVIDE THE LENGTH AND TYPES OF CLINICAL ROTATIONS WE PROVIDE THAT IN OUR CATALOG TODAY IF A STUDENT WANTS IT. WE'RE ALSO GOING TO PROVIDE THE SUPERVISION RATIO AT EACH SITE I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH THAT'S GOING TO ADD TO THE DOCUMENT BUT IT'S GOING TO ADD TO THE DOCTOR. WE'RE THEN GOING TO PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT ALL OF OUR STUDENTS IN THAT PROGRAM WE PROVIDE DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION TO DAY TO THE BUREAU AND ALSO TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THROUGH IPADS. ALL DISCLOSED ALL PUBLIC INFORMATION. WE ARE THEN ALSO GOING TO JUST TO HAVE -- TO REPORT OUR EMPLOYMENT RETENTION AS THE FORM YOU SEE THEIR SHOWS WE HAVE TO REPORT. JOB PLACEMENT TODAY BUT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO PUT ADDITIONAL SECTIONS IN THIS FORM. WE'RE ALSO GONNA HAVE TO TALK ABOUT WHETHER WE DONATE MONEY TO THE SCHOOL TO GET PLACEMENT SITES WHICH IS OFFENSIVE WE DO NOT BRIBE THESE PLACES TO GET CLINICAL SLOTS. SO THIS NINE TO TEN PAGE DOCUMENT THAT YOU'RE LOOKING IN FRONT OF YOU IS GOING TO TURN INTO A THIRTY TO FORTY TO FIFTY PAGE DOCUMENT. THAT IS ON TOP OF OUR CATALOG THAT IS ON TOP OF OUR THIRTY TO FORTY PAGE ROAMING AGREEMENT THAT IS ON TOP OF AYE OUR IPAD STATED THAT IS ON TOP OF THE SHOPPING SHE THIS IS. A MORTGAGE DOCUMENT FOLKS WE HAVE NOW. LEGISLATED AND REGULATED A MORTGAGE DOCUMENT FOR A STUDENT TO PICK A SCHOOL. SO I THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE. AGAIN MOST OF THIS DATA IS HERE. AND THIS IS THE LAST POLICY COMMITTEE THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO GO BEFORE. A AS YOU SEE IN THE FORM BEFORE YOU IT'S TWO YEARS OF DATA THAT WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THIS BILL IS COMPLETELY SILENT ON HOW MANY YEARS OF DATA WE HAVE TO PROVIDE OF DO WE HAVE TO PROVIDE THE TWO YEARS OF DATA THAT THE CURRENT SCHOOL. SCHOOL PERFORMANCE FACT SHEET MANDATES. DO A REPORT LAST YEAR'S COHORT DO A REPORT ALL THAT THE CLINICAL SITES THAT WE HAVE CONTRACTS WITH. ALL OF THESE IN ALL OF THESE DETAILS ARE NOT OUTLINED IN THE BILL AGAIN THIS IS THE LAST POLICY COMMITTEE THIS BILL IS GOING BEFORE. SOME OF THE ASSERTIONS AND THAT AND THE CLAIMS THAT THE PROPONENTS WANT FROM THE BILL THIS IS GOING TO STUDENTS. THIS ISN'T A STUDY THAT'S GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR YOU WALDRON TO COLLECT THAT DATA AND MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT OUR CLINICAL SITES THIS IS NOT A STUDY BILL. THIS IS REAL LIFE WHAT OUR SCHOOLS ARE GONNA HAVE TO ADOPT IT IS EXPENSIVE. I WOULD ARGUE IT IS DUPLICATIVE AND AT THE END OF THE DAY ARE STUDENTS ARE NOT ASKING FOR THIS INFORMATION. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE REPORT TWO YEARS OUR CLINICAL SITE FROM TWO YEARS AGO THAT WOULD HAVE TO PUT IN THIS REPORT IS NOT THE CLINICAL SITE THAT A STUDENT THAT IS APPLYING TO DAY IS GOING TO GO. TO SO IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME CLINICAL SITE. THAT THE STUDENTS GOING TO ATTEND A YEAR TO TWO YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WHEN THEY GET TO THAT PLACE IN THEIR EDUCATION SO. FOR ALL OF THESE REASONS WE HAVE TO OPPOSE THE BILL AND AGAIN THIS IS THE LAST STOP FOR THIS BILL AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNANSWERED. AND I WOULD I WOULD JUST REMIND THE NEXT WITNESS THAT WE SAID TWO MINUTES TO WITNESSES AND I THINK HE WENT OVER FOUR MINUTES AGO. IF YOU COULD MAKE IT BRIEF. THANK YOU JENNIFER TARA HELL WITH AARON READ AND ASSOCIATES ON BEHALF OF AMERICAN CAREER COLLEGE AND WEST COAST UNIVERSITY. AMERICAN CREW COLLEGE OPERATING SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT WEST COAST UNIVERSITY OPERATING SINCE NINETEEN OH NINE HAVE AN EXCELLENT REPUTATION FOR PROVIDING TOP NOTCH. HEALTHCARE CAREER EDUCATION TO STUDENTS THROUGHOUT LA THE INLAND EMPIRE AND ORANGE COUNTY. SB THIRTEEN FORTY EIGHT IT'S CONCERNING TO OUR SCHOOL SPECIFICALLY FOR SEVERAL REASONS FIRST OUR SCHOOLS DON'T PAY HOSPITALS TO PLACE STUDENTS IN THE CLINICAL INTERNSHIPS NEEDED FOR LICENSURE. THE CONTRACT SCHOOLS HAVE WITH HOSPITALS FOR CLINICAL PLACEMENTS ARE NOT EXCLUSIVE AND HOSPITALS ARE NOT AS LIMITED AS TO WHICH SCHOOLS THEY CAN CONTRACT WITH. SECOND LICENSING BOARDS AND AND APPROVAL OF SCHOOLS PROGRAMS. DID THAT ENSURES THAT STUDENTS RECEIVE THE CLINICAL HOURS REQUIRED TO LICENSING EXAMS. REQUIRING SCHOOLS TO REPORT CLINICAL PLACEMENT DATA IN THE SCHOOL PERFORMANCE FACTSHEET AS MATT MENTIONED DOES NOT PROVIDE BETTER OUTCOMES BUT WILL REQUIRE US TO HIRE ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. TO PRODUCE THE DATA CALLED FOR IN THE BILL THIS DATA WILL BE OUTDATED AS SOON AS IT'S REPORTED. OUR SCHOOLS HAVE HUNDREDS OF CLINICAL PARTNERS AND CLINICAL PLACEMENTS CONTINUALLY CHANGE THAT CAN'T BE STRESSED ENOUGH. THAT THAT PLACEMENTS TO BE REPORTED ON THE FACT SHEET WILL NOT REFLECT THE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS OF POTENTIAL STUDENTS RECEIVE. ONE SET STUDENT HAS MADE IT TO THE POINT IN THE PROGRAM WHERE THEY'RE ACTUALLY GONNA PARTICIPATE IN CLINICAL PLACEMENT AND NEXT TO BE PP THIS. IT SCHOOL PERFORMANCE FACTUALLY AS MATT HAD MENTIONED SO I WON'T GO OVER THAT AGAIN. I'M BUT THERE ARE WAYS TO RELIEVE PRESSURE ON CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF THIS IS STEMMING FROM. YES THAT THE INDUSTRY THERE'S A A CALL FOR MORE AND PROFESSIONALS ENTERING THE WORKFORCE AND AND THERE'S A PRESSURE FOR THESE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND WE WELCOME A DISCUSSION AN OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT. A MORE CLINICAL PLACEMENTS AND HOW TO RELIEVE PRESSURE FOR THOSE AND THAT THIS BILL IS NOT THE WAY TO GO IT WOULD JUST CREATED ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN AND I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. YEAH I GIVE UP. OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY TWEENER WHO'S. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SENATOR PAN IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE. NO THANK YOU SO MUCH -- NO LIGHTS I APPRECIATE -- THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THE OPPOSITION I WOULD POINT OUT IS THE HEALTH PROFESSION MYSELF AND SOMEONE WHO SERVED ON A TRADING BODY NOT ONLY FOR VISION BUT ALSO FOR ALLIED HEALTH PROFESSIONALS THAT. ARE -- CLINICAL TRAINING IS ESSENTIAL PART OF THE EDUCATION OF AN ALLIED HEALTH FOR NOTE THAT -- THAT. SCHOOL THAT IS PROVIDING CLINICAL TRAINING BECAUSE TALK ABOUT THE BURDEN OF GATHERING INFORMATION I SURE HOPE THEY WOULD KNOW WHERE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE GAINED A TRAINING IN THE QUALITY OF THE TRAINING THAT'S TAKING PLACE IN THE CLINICAL SITES. THEY DON'T HAVE THAT INFORMATION READILY AT HAND I'D BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT. ARE IN FACT -- I'D A SOMEONE WHO SERVED ON THE GRADING BODY -- AS IT WAS MENTIONED THEY ALSO FEEL THAT INFORMATION SHOULD ALSO BE RELIEVED BAILABLE AT THEIR FINGERTIPS WHEN ACCREDITING BODY ASKS ABOUT AS WELL SO. SO I END. LITTLE CONCERN ABOUT. ABOUT BUT THAT PART OF THE TESTIMONY BUT I WOULD I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US AGAIN AS I SAID BEGINNING THAT. THIS INFORMATION IS IMPORTANT FOR STUDENTS KNOW THE QUALITY EDUCATION BUT ALSO IMPORTANT FOR US AND YOU HEARD FROM -- THE COMMITTEE COLLEGES AS WELL FROM BOTH FACULTY ADMINISTRATION THAT THEY'VE THAT THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM AS WELL TO HELP US BE SURE WE HAVE THE STATE CONVENE FORWARD AND AND PROVIDE THE WORKFORCE SUPPLY THAT WE NEED. TO TAKE CARE OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONS AND SO AYE URGENT AYE BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU DOCTOR PAN -- ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MOVE BY MS QUIRK SILVA.

QUIRK SILVA I SANTIAGO WEBER WEBER I RIGHT THREE WE WILL HAVE THAT ON CALL DOCTOR PAN THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. NEXT ITEM THREE OR ITEM TO EXCUSE ME -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACOSTA FOR SENATOR BERRYHILL. FILE ITEM. TO WELCOME MISTER COST THANK YOU. CHAIR MEDINA AND MEMBERS. TODAY'S PRINT THE PRINCIPLE COOPER I HAVE THE HONOR OF PRESENTING SB NINE SIXTY SEVEN ON BEHALF OF SENATOR BERRYHILL WHO COULD NOT BE HERE TODAY. ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION SEEKS TO ELIMINATE ONE OF THE PRIMARY BARRIERS TO HIGHER EDUCATION FOR OUR FOSTER YOUTH THE COST OF TUITION. THE FOSTER YOUTH ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY THAN THEIR PEERS TO ENROLL IN COLLEGE IF THEY COMPLETE HIGH SCHOOL WHICH FEWER THAN HALF DO. THEY ARE ALSO LESS LIKELY TO GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE IF THEY DO ONE ROLE. SEVERAL FACTORS BOTH ACADEMIC AND NON ACADEMIC CONTRIBUTE TO THIS GAP IN EDUCATIONAL SUCCESSES. FOSTER KIDS DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO TURN TO THEIR PARENTS FOR INFORMATION ABOUT COLLEGE HELP WITH APPLICATIONS FOR ASSISTANCE WITH THEIR TUITION. WELL THOSE WHO ARE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ADOPTED OUR FORMER LIKELY TO ATTEND COLLEGE ADOPTION IS ALREADY AN EXPENSIVE PROPOSITION FOR THE FAMILIES. WITHOUT EVEN CONSIDERING THE COST OF COLLEGE AND FEES. THIS CAN BE CONSIDERABLE TORRENT FOR PARENTS CONSIDERING ADOPTION THOSE WHO DO ADOPT FOSTER CHILDREN OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE SAVINGS IN PLACE FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. S. B. NINE SIXTY SEVEN WAR WILL WAIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CSU YOU SEE TUITION AND FEES FOR FOSTER KIDS WHO HAVE BEEN IN FOSTER CARE FOR AT LEAST TWELVE MONTHS. THE STUDENT WOULD FOOT FIRST OUT OF THE REQUIRED TO FILL OUT THE FAST FOR ANY TUITION WAIVER WOULD TAKE PLACE AFTER GRANTS OR SCHOLARSHIPS ARE ACCOUNTED. FOR TWENTY EIGHT STATES ALREADY HAVE TUITION WAIVER PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND MOVING THIS BURIED EDUCATION HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE A TRUE GAME CHANGER. THEN THE LIVES OF SO MANY FOSTER YOU IN THIS STATE. WELL CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF AS A LEADER IN SO MANY POLICY AREAS IT'S TIME WE FOLLOW THE LEAD OF SO MANY OTHER STATES THAT HAVE MADE FOSTER YOUTH THE PRIORITY. AND GIVE THEM A CHANCE FOR SUCCESS S. BE NINE SIXTY SEVEN WILL DO JUST THAT. THE BILL HAS ENJOYED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT THROUGH THE SENATE AND I HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE THAT HERE TODAY. I HAVE AT HOWARD WITH THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT BANK THREE TIME IN S. RIVAL. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AT HOWARD SENIOR COUNSEL AT THE CHILDREN'S ADVOCACY INSTITUTE AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SAN DIEGO SCHOOL OF LAW THANK YOU FOR THE MOMENT BRIEFLY TO ADDRESS YOU ON WHEN -- THE GOVERNMENT COMES INTO OUR HOMES AND REMOVES OUR CHILDREN FROM OUR SHARE. THAT IS PROBABLY THE MOST SICK -- TO OUR GOVERNMENT THERE IS NOTHING WORSE THAT YOU COULD DO TO ME -- AS MY FAMILY THAT TO COME IN AND TAKE MY AYE DAUGHTER AWAY. AS A RESULT -- BECAUSE OF THAT WIN THE STATE -- WHEN WE COLLECTIVELY AS THE STATE REMOVE A CHILD FROM THE CARE OF THEIR PARENTS WE INCUR A MORAL RESPONSIBILITY LIKE NO OTHER -- UP THE LATITUDE AND LONGITUDE OF STATE GOVERNMENT. WE BECOME LITERALLY AND THE PARENTS OF THESE CHILDREN AND WE ARE PROPERLY AND FAIRLY JUDGED BY HOW WELL WE ARE DOING BY THEM. WHEN THEY GROW UP? IN THIS INSTANCE WHEN IT COMES TO COMPLETING HIGHER EDUCATION. WE EARN A FAILING GRADE. ACCORDING TO MOST STUDIES APPROXIMATELY 3% 3%. A FORMER FOSTER CHILDREN GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE DID NOT DO PARTICULARLY WELL IN ARITHMETIC BUT I DO KNOW HOW TO ROUND. IF WE WOULD AROUND THAT. THAT WOULD BE [inaudible] ZERO NONE. ARE CURRENTLY GRADUATING. FROM COLLEGE THESE ARE OUR CHILDREN. AND GIVEN OUR UNIQUE MORE RESPONSIBILITY AND THIS DISGRACEFUL RESULT THAT CHANGES ALL IT IS NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHEN CONSIDERING THE FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OF THESE CHILDREN START FROM THE BEGINNING PLACE. THAT WE WILL NOT IN OUR OWN INSTITUTIONS CHARGE OUR OWN CHILDREN MONEY. AS FOR THE GETTING PLAY. A THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BILL I CONGRATULATE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BEING A CO AUTHOR AND I'M VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE SENATOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD -- TWENTY EIGHT STATES WE SHOULD BE THE TWENTY NINTH RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU.
