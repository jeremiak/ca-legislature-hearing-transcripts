TODAY WE'LL BE DISCUSSING BETTER PROPOSALS FROM THE JUDICIAL BRANCH IN THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. FOR EACH ITEM THE SPEAKERS ARE LISTED IN SPEAKING ORDER IN THE AGENDA. I ALSO WANT TO TAKE A MINUTE- TO WELCOME A NEW MEMBER TO THE COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WATER WELCOME. WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE YOU HERE. OUR FIRST ITEM IS COURT BACKLOGS AND REMOTE HEARINGS AND WE WILL GO AHEAD AND GET STARTED WITH THE PANELISTS AND THEY COULD SPEAK IN THE ORDER. LISTED IN THE AGENDA. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROBERT A YOUNG AND I AM THE CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. FOLLOW UP WITH A BACKLOG DATA NOW FROM THE START OF THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH TWO THOUSAND. UP TO THE NEWS SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. HOW WE CAN. CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. SO WE DETERMINED BACKLOG BY LOOKING AT TWO THINGS. OUR COMPANY FILINGS ARE COMING IN AND HOW FAST CAN THE COURTS PROCESS. IF THE COURT CANNOT PROCESS ALL THE FINALLY COMING IN THERE'S A BACKLOG. OF THAT BACKLOG IS DRIVEN BY WHAT'S CALLED CLEARANCE RATE. AND THIS IS THE MEASUREMENT OF HOW FAST THE COURTS CAN PROCESS DEFINED. A PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC IF THE COURT HAD A HUNDRED FILINGS COME IN. THEY COULD PROCESS EIGHTY SIX OF THEM. WHICH IS A CLEARANCE RATE OF EIGHTY SIX PERCENT. IT WOULD RESULT IN A BACKLOG OF FOURTEEN CASE. FOR THE OVERALL PANDEMIC PERIOD THE FRENCH CLEARANCE RATE IS EIGHTY THREE PERCENT. WHICH IS SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN THE PRE PENTOMIC RIGHT 86% R. FOR THE- ALL- IN THE BEGINNING OF THE CLEARANCE RATE WENT DOWN ACTUALLY TO SEVENTY THREE PERCENT. BUT NOW IT'S RECOVERED AND HOVERED AROUND EIGHTY SIX THE NOT EIGHTY NINE PERCENT. OVER THE PAST THREE QUARTERS. IN MOST CASES TYPES OF FILINGS ARE DOWN ABOUT TIMES WHICH PROVIDES. SOME BUFFER FOR THE COURTS TO CATCH UP. IN ADDITION THE COURTS WERE ABLE THEIR CLIENTS RATES PRINT PANDEMIC DUE TO THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE REMOTE PROCEEDINGS IN MANY AREAS. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN THE JUVENILE AREA WHERE REMOTE PROCEEDINGS ARE WIDELY USED ARE THE PANDEMIC CLEARANCE RATES EXCEEDED PRE PLANNED ROUTES. OUR GENERAL CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HAVE BEEN FOCUSED AROUND PHYSICAL DISTANCE CONSTRAINTS ARE WHICH REDUCE THE COURT ROOM CAPACITY. AND WORKFORCE SHORTAGES SIMILAR TO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OTHER AREAS BOTH THE PRIVATE AND THE PUBLIC SECTOR. SO FOR EXAMPLE CREE PANDEMIC VACANCY RATES HOVER AROUND 629% AT SEVERAL COURTS AND DURING THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC. THAT RATE INCREASE. NINE TO FIFTEEN PERCENT. ARE AND AS OF THIS MONTH THOSE COURTS ACTUALLY HAVE A AVERAGE VACANCY RATE NOW OF TEN TO SEVENTEEN PERCENT. SO WHILE SOME COURTS EVERITT CURRENTLY THEIR PRE PANDEMIC VACANCY RATES ARE MANY HAVE NOT. OTHER VACANCY IS DUE TO TWO PRIMARY FACTORS BUT THE FIRST IS DIFFICULTY IN FILLING VACANCIES AND THE SECOND IS IN MANAGING COVERT EXPOSURES. ARE AGAIN FOR EXAMPLE IN ONE COURT. A COURT ROOM CLERK JOB POSTING WHICH TYPICALLY RESULT IN ABOUT FIFTY APPLICANTS FREE PANDEMIC. BUT NOW ONLY ELEVEN O'CLOCK. ANOTHER COURT WAS ABLE TO HIRE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN PEOPLE IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR. BUT A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR PEOPLE LEFT DURING THAT SAME PERIOD. BUT DURING THIS PERIOD WE ALSO SAW THE DELTA VARIANT AND A HIGH RATE OF COVERT EXPOSURE I WHICH FOR STAFF TO ISOLATE OR PRODUCE A NEGATIVE COVERT TASK. I WHICH WAS DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN AT THE TIME DUE TO TESTING SHORTAGE. REGARDING REGARDING THE A BACKLOG OF FILINGS BY DATA SHOWING THAT BACKLOG THE PRIMARIES THE FOCUS. IN THE CRIMINAL AREAS WITH THE LARGEST BACKLOG IN FELONY. AND THEN BOTH IN THE TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC MISDEMEANOR CASE. WITH THE SMALLER BACK LOG IN UNLIMITED CIVIL CASES AND NO BACKLOG IN LIVE AT LIMITED CIVIL. ARE THESE ARE THE BRANCH RIGHT ESTIMATES AND INDIVIDUAL COURT BACKLOGS MAY VERY. SO THE COURTS THAT ARE REPORTING- BACKLOGS IN THE CRIMINAL AREA ARE REPORTING FOR MAIN DRIVERS THE FIRST ONE IS VIDEO REMOTE PROCEEDINGS ARE NOT AS AVAILABLE NOR IS WIDELY USED IN CRIMINAL AS ANOTHER CASE TYPES. SECONDLY OUR PARTY SEEM WILLING LESS WILLING TO SETTLE THE CASE AND- A THIRD OF THE WORKFORCE SHORTAGE BUT I JUST MENTIONED AT THE COURTS- IS EXACERBATED FOR CRIMINAL CASE PROCESSING DUE TO THE DEPENDENCY ON JUSTICE PARTNERS WHO ARE ALSO EXPERIENCING SIMILAR WORKFORCE CHALLENGES. FINALLY FELONIES ONE OF THE CASE TYPES WERE FINDING DIPPED SHORT OF EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC- BUT QUICKLY RETURNED TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS SO COURTS DID NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO CATCH UP. LIKE THEY DID IN OTHER CASE TYPES WERE FILING VOLUMES REMAINED LOWER THAN PRE PLANNED SEEING PARTY'S LESS WILLING TO SETTLE THEIR KIDS. NOW COVERT EXPOSURES ARE ALSO AFFECTING JURY TRIALS BUT WITH A SLIGHT REDUCTION IN JURORS BEING ABLE TO SERVE PROXIMATE WITH 527% THAT A FEW COURTS. ABOUT A BIGGER IMPACT IS WHEN THE SELECTED JUROR BECOMES EXPOSED TO THE VIRUS OR EXPOSE OR SOMEONE IS TESTED POSITIVE WHICH RESULT IN THE ENTIRE JURY NEEDING TO ISOMERS. ARE IN ONE COURT A FORTY EIGHT JURY TRIAL TOOK TWO WEEKS BECAUSE OF THAT. NOW WE ALSO- APPRECIATE THE SUPPLEMENTAL BACKLOG FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE COURT. THAT A- ADDITIONAL FUNDING WAS USED TO HIRE TEMPORARY HELP. WHEN I RECRUITING CHALLENGES HAVE BEEN HAPPENING IRWIN STAFFER TEMPORARY OUT ON LEAVE AND THAT'S HELPED REDUCE THE GOING BACK WHILE. SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING HAS ALSO BEEN USED TO PAY FOR TEMPORARY FACILITY RENTALS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS ARE SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO. PROVIDE SERVICES TO THE PUBLIC. SO LOOKING FORWARD WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT DATA ABOUT THE BACKLOG. AND AS WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW MEASURES TO ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC. OUR COURTS WILL STILL STRUGGLE WITH THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURES AND PHYSICAL DISTANCE HOWEVER BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC BEGINS TO SUBSIDE. WE ANTICIPATE COURTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG OVER TALK. THANK YOU. HI THIS IS HEATHER CREDIT I AM THE CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER FOR THE NATIONAL COUNCIL CALIFORNIA JUST TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE ON AB AT SEVEN SIXTEEN AND THE B. C. P. ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- THIS B. C. P. IS SPECIFICALLY TO ADDRESS THE OLDER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS WITHIN EACH OF THE COURT ROOMS AND HOW THEY WILL ASSIST IN PROMOTING OUT REMOVAL PROCEEDINGS AND ACCESS TO THE TRIAL COURTS I TO THE PUBLIC AS WELL. SO I HAD THIS REALLY IS TO REPLACE MUCH OF THE OLD AUDIO EQUIPMENT THAT WAS INSTALLED OVER TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT REALLY DOESN'T- ALIGNED WELL WITH THE NEW TECHNOLOGY DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THAT IS OUT THERE AND THAT IS THE FUNDAMENTAL BASIS FOR THIS REQUEST IS FOR ALL OF THOSE COURTROOMS THAT ARE OLDER THAN TWENTY YEARS OF AGE THAT WE WOULD UPGRADE THAT UNDERLYING INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN NOW RUN THE NEW TECHNOLOGY AND DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY THAT WE HAVE INVESTED IN OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. THANK YOU. SO HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE BEEN NOT THIS AREA. THANK YOU FOR THE APARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. YES I JUST YOUR ONLINE DEPARTMENT FINANCE TO EXPAND ON THE TV SHOW COUNCILS PRESENTATION JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT HAD INCLUDED SIXTY MILLION ONE TIME GENERAL FUND FOR THE TRIAL COURTS TO ADDRESS BACKLOGS REFLECT WASTE. RESULTING FROM THE COVENANTING PANDEMIC IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THIS MONEY CAN ALSO BE USED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE FISCAL YEAR. I THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT ALSO INCLUDED THIRTY MILLION LONGTIME GENERAL FUND TO ADDRESS CERTAIN CRIMINAL CASE BACKLOGS. I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MY HOUSE WANTED TO RETURN TO THE BACKLOGS. I WANNA I WANNA KNOWLEDGE THE PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO REDUCE THE COURT BACKLOGS. THUS FAR- AND- WANTED APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION WITH INFORMATION ABOUT FELONY TRIALS ON IN JURY. JURY JURY ISSUES THAT HAVE COME UP ALONG THE WAY IN JURY TRIALS IS THIS A SIMILAR IS- THE IS THE BACKLOG FOR THE MISDEMEANOR CASES SMILAR TO THE FELONY TRIALS ARE CERTAIN DIFFERENT REASON WHY WE HAVEN'T SEEN- AS MUCH PROGRESS AS IS SEEN AS SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS. YES IT'S SIMILAR. OKAY AND THEN FOR THE TECHNOLOGY REQUEST FOR THE COURTS DOES THIS QUALIFY AS THE CELL EXCLUDABLE EXPENSE. COULD YOU PLEASE CLARIFY THAT EXCLUDED EXPENSE. THE F. SL SA L. THIS IS THIS IS LIKE COMPUTER JUDICIAL COUNCIL IF I MAY THAT MIGHT BE A QUESTION FOR- POSTED APARTMENT OF FINANCE- WHEN I WOULD TRY TO CLEAR OUT ALL THE SALIX WOULD WILL RULES IN ORDER DEFERRED TAX QUESTION TO THEM THANK YOU THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. I JUST YOUR MIND BUT NOTHING I DON'T TO BE THAT. TO MY MANAGER ABOUT THAT ALL BE ABLE TO GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU CAN GET THE ANSWER TO THIS TO PAY. THAT THE MY COLLEAGUES HAVE QUESTION ON THIS MISTER STONE. THANK YOU SO APPRECIATE TO JUDICIAL QUE PRETTY THAT THE NUMBERS HERE AND IN THE WORK TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG. MORE HEARING DIFFERENT THINGS REALLY FROM DIFFERENT COURTS IN BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY DIFFERENT COURTS. ARE YOU SEEING. SIMILAR ABILITY TO ADDRESS A BACKLOG IN EACH COURT OR ARE THERE AREAS THAT STILL NEED SOME WORK. EVERY COURT IS DIFFERENCE AND SO- THE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED TO THE COURT IS HELPFUL IN THE AREAS THAT I HAD MENTIONED BOTH IN TERMS OF. OUR TEMPORARY HELP AND- RENTALS FOR FACILITIES NOT TECHNIQUE FOR USING THE MONEY IN THE SAME WAY HOWEVER THE MAJORITY OF THE COURTS ARE USING. THAT MONEY FOR TEMPORARY HELP- AND SO AGAIN DEPENDS ON THE INDIVIDUAL COURT- BUT THE ARE ADDRESSING IT AS BEST AS THEY CAN WITH THE RESOURCES THAT THEY HAVE. SO WHAT ARE SOME STRATEGIES A DIFFERENT COURTS ARE USING THEM TO REDUCE THE BACKLOG. SO ONE OF THE STRATEGIES. AS I HAVE MENTIONED IS TO USE OUR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING FOR A TEMPORARY HELP TO AS I MENTIONED ONE OF THE BIG DRIVERS IS WHEN PEOPLE GO OUT. AS A RESULT OF- A EXPOSURE OR INFECTION AND SO AS THOSE PEOPLE GO OUT ON ONE OF THE TECHNIQUES TO BRING ON TEMPORARY PEOPLE TO- HELP WITH THAT. THE OTHER EXAMPLE I HAD MENTIONED WAS AROUND HOW LIMITATIONS IN FACILITIES ARE AND SO IF THERE'S THE OPPORTUNITY FOR EXAMPLE TO HAVE A RENTAL OF A- EXTERNAL FACILITY. THAT'S BEING DONE HOWEVER ESPECIALLY IN THE CRIMINAL AREA WHERE THERE IS THE HIGH DEPENDENCY ON THE AVAILABILITY OF JUSTICE PARTNERS ARE SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING. CANNOT HELP THEIR- OKAY IN ARE YOU TRY. THOUGH COURT BY. THERE IS THE ABILITY TO CLEAR UP THAT THE BACKLOG AND THEIR STRATEGY SINCE YOU SAY THE ROLE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT IT'S HARD FOR US TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT. WHAT WE HEAR FROM FRATERNITIES ACROSSTHE STATE IS VERY DESPERATE AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT OVERALL IT LOOKS GOOD I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHERE THERE MIGHT BE CHALLENGES WHICH COURTS ARE STRUGGLING WHICH COURTS ARE DOING THAT. RIGHT SO WE DON'T HAVE AT THIS POINT- THE DATA AT THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL I'M PREPARED FOR YOU. HOWEVER WE DO WORK WITH EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL COURTS AND HAVE RECEIVED FEEDBACK FROM THEM IN TERMS OF THE STRATEGIES THAT THEY'RE USING- YOU ADDRESS THE BACKLOG AND THAT'S ALSO PART OF THE BEST PRACTITIONERS ACROSS THE COURT. OKAY GET IT. I GET CONCERNS WHEN BY COURT AND IT'S A LOT OF ATTORNEYS PRACTICE IN IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS AND WHEN THEIR EXPERIENCES ARE DIFFERENT JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. THAT BECOMES A LITTLE BIT CONCERNING AND THEN THE SAME QUESTIONS ESSENTIALLY ON. THE REMOTE ACCESS I'M HEARING THE SAME THING THAT REMOTE ACCESS IS WORKING SUMMERS IN AND NOT IN OTHERS WHAT WHAT'S BEING DONE TO ENSURE THAT RESOURCE ARE BEING INVESTED WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE SO THAT WE CAN HAVE AS MUCH CONSISTENCY ACROSS THE COURTS AS POSSIBLE HELLO SURE SO TO ADDRESS YOUR FIRST POINT ABOUT THE INCONSISTENCY AROUND OF THE WAVE THAT- THE BACKLOGS HAVE AFFECTED THE INDIVIDUAL COURTS- THAT'S REALLY DUE TO THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC HAS AFFECTED EACH INDIVIDUAL COUNTY IN VERY DIFFERENT WAYS SO FOR EXAMPLE IN SOME COUNTIES WERE SAYING. THERE'S NOT A HUGE NUMBER OF INFECTIONS AND SO- THERE'S EIGHT LOWER BACK WHILE IN SOME COUNTIES AS THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN OF INFECTION AND IMPACT ON THE PANDEMIC AND SAW HIGHER IMPACT ON THE BACKLOG AND SO IT REALLY VARIES BY I CALLED THE LOCAL- THE LOCAL AREA IMPACTED WITH REGARDS TO REMOTE PROCEEDINGS A REMOTE PROCEEDINGS- IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AT A PARTICULAR COURT SO THE COURTS HAVE BEEN PRETTY PROACTIVE. IN INVEST IN REMOTE. ARE AND THE THREE. SOME OF THE END OF FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED COURTS WERE ABLE TO- IMPLEMENT REMOTE TECHNOLOGY HOWEVER THERE ARE A LOT OF COURTHOUSES IN COURT ROOMS THAT HAVE AGING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND SO THIS PENDANT- DESCRIBE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE PROPOSAL TO REALLY BRING UP THE COURTS TO HAVE OLD INFRASTRUCTURE SO THERE'S MORE CONSISTENCY THERE SO THAT THERE'S A MORE CONSISTENT ENVIRONMENT. ACROSS THE COURTS AS WELL BECAUSE SOME ISSUES RELATED TO VIDEO SOME HAVE- ISSUES RELATED TO SAMPLE. RIGHT I THINK WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR US IN THESE TWO CATEGORIES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TO GET. A LITTLE BIT MORE GRANULAR DATA. COUNTY BY COUNTY THAT WE UNDERSTAND. WHERE THINGS ARE WORKING OR OR WHAT'S NOT BUT I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY WELL- I THINK MR STONE- ASK FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS FAR AS WE TRY TO MAKE SURE BEING EQUITABLE ACROSS THE STATE INCONSISTENCY APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE WHAT. IT SHARE WITH THE COMMITTEE. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO OUR SECOND ISSUE WHICH IS A TRIAL COURT EQUITY FUNDING. AND THE PANELISTS MAY BE AN- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS JOHN WORK LIVES. THE CHIEF ADMINISTRATIVE OFFICER WITH THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AND I WISH TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. BOB THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT PROPOSAL THE EYES AS YOUR AGENDA- DOES A VERY NICE JOB AND FRAMING THE ISSUE- ARE CHIEF JUSTICE THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OUR COURTS. ARE STRONG SUPPORT FOR THIS PROPOSAL WERE GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS PROPOSAL- WHICH WOULD A- LONGSTANDING STRUCTURAL ISSUES- FUNDING GAPS WITHIN THE BRANCH. SPECIFICALLY BECAUSE EQUITY FUNDING OF A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WOULD GO OUT TO OUR LOWEST POINT THE COURT- THERE APPROXIMATELY EIGHTEEN COURTS THAT OF. OUR UNDER OUR STATEWIDE AVERAGE. OUR LITTLE SCORED B. AS YOU TELL OF LOS ANGELES FOR EXAMPLE IS JUST UNDER 75% FUNDED FOR. WORKLOAD ORANGE COUNTY ANOTHER LARGE CHORDS. ABOUT 78% SAN ABOUT SEVENTY PER- AND SO. THIS IS VITAL IMPORTANT UPSET HELP COURTS OF THEIR UNDER I GET THAT LOWER SPINE COURTS THE STATE- IF YOUR ACCOUNT SO BE ALLOCATING THESE DOLLARS TO THE WORK THOSE COURT SPECIFICALLY AND IT WENT UP TO STABILIZE THE SERVICE HOURS- WITHIN OUR COURTS DAYS COURTS ARE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC- IT WOULD PROVE EMPLOYEE RETENTION RATES- BY RESTORING INCREASING STOCK LEVELS. UP BUT WOULD ALSO IMPROVE SERVICE EVERY BY REDUCING WEIGHT THE CASE TIME FOR IN PROCESSING THE WASTE NOT VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO THE PUBLIC AT CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT ALL RIGHT IT'S GOING BY- JUDGE SINGER. SO FROM PROPER- JUDGES READ ALL JUDGES STATE WHY. YEAH WELL AS KEVIN HARRIGAN EXACTLY OFFICER FORTY. AND IT'S THE VOICE ALL OF COURT STOCKTON SEE IF YOU HAVE ANY. DO WE HAVE THE L. A. LIVE UP THIS READY TO GO. I GUESS AND I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE INSURE THAT THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING PROVIDED. AS WELL AS HOW IT'S ALLOCATED REFLECTS LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES SERVICE THE GOAL OF PROMOTING FISCAL EQUITY AMONGST THE TRIAL COURTS IS. IT HAS MERIT THE GOAL OF MERIT AS IT PROMOTES EQUAL ACCESS TO JUSTICE ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR HOW EXACTLY THE MONEY WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED TO ACHIEVE THAT S. AS ON THAT DECISION IS GOING TO BE LEFT TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF PROMOTING FISCAL EQUITY WHICH CAN IMPACT THE NUMBER OF COURTS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING AS WELL AS HOW MUCH THEY RECEIVE. SO FOR EXAMPLE. THE COURTS HAVE A WORKLOAD FORMULA AND THAT BASICALLY IDENTIFIES THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING RELATIVE TO WORKLOAD THAT- A COURT NEEDS TO KIND OF ADDRESS THAT WORKLOAD. AND SO THE FUNDING COULD BE TARGETED TO THE COURTS BELOW THE STATEWIDE AVERAGE AS KIND OF REFERENCED BY MR WARDLAW AND HIS COMMENTS WHICH IS WHAT WE DID IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ACCORDING COULD BE TARGET TO HIT THE DESIGNATED FUNDING PERCENTAGE SO THAT ALL COURTS ARE AT LEAST A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF MONEY. WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT OTHER. COULD ALSO BE CONSIDERED- MOST NOTABLY THE THINGS THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT IN TERMS OF ISSUE ONE IN TERMS OF ADDRESSING PANDEMIC RELATED IMPACTS SUCH AS BACKLOGS AND DELAYS. IN COURT PROCEEDINGS AND THIS COULD HELP ADDRESS EQUITY IN TERMS OF PUBLIC ACCESS TO THE COURTS AND HOW QUICKLY CASES CAN BE RESOLVED. SO IN LINE WITH THIS ONE OPTION THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER IS TO PROVIDE SOME OR ALL OF THE REQUESTED FUNDING IN THE BUDGET YEAR. TO ADDRESS CAN DEMOCRAT LATE IMPACTS- TO HELP WITH THIS LEGISLATURE COULD HAVE THE JUDICIAL BRANCH- PROVIDE MORE DATA OR REPORT FURTHER IN THE SPRING. MORE UPDATED INFORMATION AND THEN THE FUNDING IN FUTURE YEARS COULD BE ALLOCATED TO ENSURE THAT ALL COURTS HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF FUNDING SUCH AS EIGHTY FOUR POINT 5% OF THEIR IDENTIFY NEAT. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. I JUST YEAR AMONG DEPARTMENTS FINANCE THAT NOTHING FURTHER TO ADD AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU AND SO- AND HAS IN EQUITY AND ENHANCING ACCESS TO JUSTICE I THINK IT'S THE GOAL THAT WE ALL. HAVE BUT MY QUESTION IS SIMILAR TO PASS PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME TO THE COMMITTEE ABOUT THE DETAILS. ENSURING THAT WE WILL BE USING THE MONIES FOR. FOR OUR GOAL AND TRACKING THAT AND AN ASSESSMENT TO BEHIND THAT- IN SEOUL. UNDER THE CURRENT PROPOSAL DID YOU DISLIKE COUNCIL IS GOING TO COME UP WITH THE DISTRIBUTION FORMULA. IS THAT CORRECT. BONTA I'M SURE JOHN WOULD LOG IN AND- I WILL COMMENT THAT. AS WE ENTER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE- THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH DURING THE FALL- LAST JULY OUR COUNCIL PUT FORWARD A PROPOSAL IT WAS MADE PUBLIC- THAT WAS DESIGNED SPECIFICALLY FOR ADDRESSING EQUITY WITHIN THE BRANCH AT THE TRIAL COURTS. AND IT LAID OUT THAT- YOU KNOW OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IS TO GET THOSE LOWER FUNDED COURTS OP AND SO- CERTAINLY- IT. SHEIKH CONSIDERATION HERE AND SHOULD YOU ARE PASSED THIS AS PROPOSED IT AND I FULLY EXPECT THAT THE JEWISH OF HOW. WOULD DOES FIND CONSIST WITH THE WAY IN WHICH IT ORIGINALLY PER. WHICH WOULD THOSE LOWER FUNDED COURTS. SO- HOW WILL YOU ENSURE THAT THE COURTS. R. ACTUALLY YOU SEEN- THE DOLLARS ADEQUATELY AND MAKING THEM INVESTMENTS AND IN APPROPRIATE WAYS R. HARI IN AB WHERE DO WE HAVE A MEASURE OF HOW WE'RE GONNA BE TRACKING SUCCESS- AND ENSURING THAT WE INCREASE ACCESS TO JUSTICE FOR COURT USERS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WE DO HAVE- WE HAVE- LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED ARE REPORTING AS FAR AS- STANDARDS FOR COURTS AND THAT THAT REPUBLICANS HAVE. REALLY THAT'S ONE VEHICLE WHICH WE CAN. MEASURE COURTS AND HOW THERE ARE MOVING FORWARD- IT THE REALITY IS MANY COURT BRING DIFFERENT PLACES RIGHT NOW WITH DIFFERENT NEEDS AND- YOU KNOW WE APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN. COURSE AND ASK- WITH REGARD TO DISCRETIONARY FUNDS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE ADDRESSING PUBLIC- IT AS BEST NEEDED IN THOSE AREAS. ARE I KNOW OUR COURTS TALKING ABOUT STANDARD. HOURS AND DAYS- OPEN TO THE PUBLIC- THERE IS A REAL CHALLENGE WITH REGARD TO YOUR RETAINING STAFF- AND CREASING STAFFING LEVELS QUITE FRANKLY AND I EXPECT THAT. YOU ARE A HIGH PRIORITY THERE TO ABOUT- SO I JUST I GUESS YOU KNOW- WE KEEP HEARING ABOUT THE SCRIPT A CEASE AND IN DIFFERENT COURTS AND SOUL WHY. WANT TO BE COMFORTABLE WITH THE IDEA FLEXIBILITY IN LETTING COURTS DECIDE THAT IT'S ON TO MAKE SURE THAT AT THE BACK AND WE HAVE SOME REAL ACCOUNTABILITY- TO THAT HE- DISCREPANCIES ARE ARE JUSTIFIABLE IF THEY EXIST BECAUSE MAYBE THERE'S DIFFERENT. WITHOUT WITH THE PANDEMIC DIFFERENT. DIFFERENT SEARCHES IN DIFFERENT AREAS BUT- I DO THINK WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A LITTLE BIT BETTER HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOT THAT ACCOUNTABILITY. I'M SURE WE HAPPY TO WORK WITH STAFF ON ABSOLUTELY. MR STYLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WOULD LIKE TO UNDERSCORE WHAT YOU JUST SAID. I THINK WE'VE WE'VE SEEN AND SORT OF UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU JUST COUNCIL WANTS TO DO WITH THIS MONEY. BUT WE HAVE STRUGGLED IN THE PASSING GETTING REPORTING. AND CLARITY ON ON HOW MONEY IS TO BE SPENT. FROM THIS COMMITTEE STANDPOINT THIS EQUITY FUNDING I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. BUT WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE PLAN IS. WHAT THE METRICS ARE. AND ON AN ONGOING BASIS REPORTING SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS. APPROPRIATE APPLICATION EQUITABLE APPLICATION. ENDS I ALSO THINK THAT SOMETHING. THAT THIS COMMITTEE THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO SEE ON THE COURSE. YOU HAVE FIFTY EIGHT SEPARATE SOMETIMES LITTLE FIEFDOMS. AND THAT CAUSES SOME SOME CONCERN AND INCONSISTENCIES. IN APPLICATION AND IMPLEMENTATION COURT BY COURTS. IF WE'RE GOING TO BE COMING UP WITH A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS. FOR THIS EQUITY I THINK WHAT WE WHAT THINGS WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IS THAT WE'RE LIFTING UP. COURTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH WHATEVER IT IS THAT THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH BUT ALSO INSISTING THAT THERE ARE THERE THERE ARE ENOUGH CONSISTENCIES AMONG ALL THE COURTS SO THAT ANYONE PRACTICING BEFORE COURT FOR ANYONE BEING CALLED IN FRONT OF THE COURT. HAS THE BEST CHANCE POSSIBLE OF UNDERSTANDING WHAT'S HAPPENING AND WHY SO. GETTING THE PLAN ENSURING THAT THERE'S ADEQUATE REPORTING AND DRIVING'S BETTER CONSISTENCY AMONG THE COURTS WOULD CERTAINLY BE SOME OF I THINK THIS COMMITTEES GOALS AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU MEMBER STEP ON IT AND WE ARE IN AGREEMENT THERE WITH REGARD TO ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT. PUBLIC FUNDS ARE ARE ARE SPENT APPROPRIATELY ABSOLUTELY AND- YEAH WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE THERE- AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT. THE COURT FAMILIES ALSO YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THIS VERY SAME ISSUES- JUDGE CENTER. MR HARRIGAN BOB OUR- COURT LEADERSHIP AND I ALSO ARE INVOLVED IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT ACCOUNTABILITY THE STANDARDS. OF WORK SYSTEM IT'S WORKING OUT RIGHT NOW. OKAY THANK YOU'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THIRTEEN THAT ARE CLOSE COURT CONSTRUCTION PROPOSAL. IS THE DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES SERVICES FOR THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL. SHARE THE MEDICARE BILL MCCORMICK DIRECTOR OF FACILITIES SERVICES IT IS A COUNCIL- WE HAVE THREE- PROPOSALS BEFORE YOU TODAY- A FORTY MILLION DOLLAR BACKFIELD THE COR CONSTRUCTION- FUND UP FIFTEEN POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING FOR CRITICAL BUILDING REPAIRS THE TRIAL COURTS AND TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS IN CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS. APPLE PROJECT REQUESTS FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE INCLUDE CONTINUING BASIS FOR TRIAL COURT PROJECT IN MENDOCINO BUTTE AND ST BERNARD DINO AND FIVE NEW START CAPITAL PROJECTS FOR THE TRIAL COURT'S IN SOLANA FRESNO PLUMAS SAN LUIS OBISPO AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY. THE FACILITY PROGRAM REQUEST CONSIDERATION FOR AN ONGOING INCREASE TO THE TRIAL COURT CAPITOL BUILDING REPAIR BUNDY. HAS NO ADJUSTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO THIS BUDGET SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THE HEARING TO AGENDA INCLUDES A SUMMARY OF THESE REQUEST OF THE STATUS OF THE ONGOING CAPITAL PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT. YES MANAGER THE PAST TWO OF THIS IS LIKE OF EUROVISION JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THE NEED FOR THE FORTY MILLION DOLLAR BACKLOG IN THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FONG. I'M IT IS ONE OF FUNDS ITS HAD A DECLINING REVENUE I'M OVER THE LAST SEVERAL ON FISCAL YEARS AND- IN ORDER TO ENSURE ITS SOLVENCY AND TO. ADDRESS DEBT SERVICE STAFF COMPLEMENT THE SORT OF MODIFICATIONS A- NOW BACK OF THE PAST FORTY MILLION. IS PROPOSED- AS ALWAYS- DEFINITELY IS A SOUL. I LOOK FORWARD TO SECURE SUPPORT TO MAINTAIN. SOLVENCY OF THIS CRITICAL CONSTRUCTION FUND. BUT HERE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. I NEED ONLY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND WE WENT OUT FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT- THIS IS THIS FIND IS ONE OF THOSE FUNDS THAT RECEIVES- LEVINE- OFF LINE AS WELL- COULD PROVE ANY BE REVENUE AS WELL AS OTHER REVENUES AND SO IT'S GOING TO FACTOR INTO YOUR DISCUSSION AND- ON THE NEXT ISSUE ITEM AS WELL AS KIND OF PRIOR CONVERSATIONS YOU HAD- ARE CONCERNED SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS FIND AND THIS MEANS PROPOSALS IS THAT THERE IS A LONG TERM SOLVENCY ISSUE IN THIS CONTRACTION FUND THAT IS NOT. PROPOSED TO BE ADDRESSED AND THE SOLVENCY WILL LIKELY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT FUND RESOURCES ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO PAY FOR THE% DEBT SERVICE FOR ALREADY COMPLETED COURTHOUSES AND SO DO IN ORDER TO PERMANENTLY ADDRESS THE LONG TERM SOLVENCY OF THIS CONSTRUCTION ACCOUNT WE ACTUALLY RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHIFT FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR TRIAL COURT CONSTRUCTION TO THE GENERAL FUND BY SHIFTING OFF FINANCING OBLIGATIONS OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND. APPROPRIATING GENERAL FUND TO MAINTAIN SUPPORT FOR EXISTING PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED- THROUGH THIS ACCOUNT AND THEN DEPOSITING ALL REVENUES THAT WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE BEEN DEPOSITED INTO THIS ACCOUNT INTO THE GENERAL FUND INSTEAD SO THEY'RE STILL AVAILABLE TO OFFSET THOSE COSTS THAT GOT SHIFTED. AND SO THIS APPROACH WOULD ENSURE THAT ALL CONSTRUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS ARE FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR AND CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE EVALUATING THE STATE'S OVERALL PHYSICAL CONDITION AND DETERMINING GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER FULL RESPONSIBILITY IS SHIFTED OVER TO THE GENERAL FUND WE DO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROPRIATE FUNDING FOR FACILITY RELATED PROJECTS BASED ON ITS GENERAL FUND PRIORITIES. IF IT IS A PRIORITY THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER ADDITIONAL ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PORT FACILITY PROJECTS SUCH AS FOR PHILLY MODIFICATION OR EFERRED MAINTENANCE. AS THE JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS IDENTIFIED SIGNIFICANT FACILITY NEEDS AND THIS TYPE OF SPENDING IS EXCLUDABLE UNDER SAL. THANK YOU CAN LEAVE HAPPY HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. JUST A REMINDER PARTNER FINANCE- THE IMMINENT INSOLVENCY AT THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND IS ONE MANIFESTATION OF A BROADER PROBLEM RELATED TO REDUCE REVENUES FOR NOT ONLY THIS FUND. ANOTHER RECIPIENT FUNDS INCLUDING COURTS SPECIAL FUNDS THEREFORE ANY WE BELIEVE ANY SOLUTION FOR THIS FUND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN A BROADER CONTEXT OF HOW TO ADDRESS INTENDED IMPENDING SOLVENCY ISSUES. FOR OTHER COURTS SPECIAL FUNDS FOR INSTANCE OTHER POTENTIAL SOLUTIONS KICKED COULD INCLUDE STOPPING TRANSFERS OF RESOURCES TO AND FROM OR SPECIAL FUNDS MOVING CERTAIN EXPENDITURES FROM EACH SPECIAL GOING TO THE GENERAL FUND. OR GENERAL FUND CONSOLIDATION IN GENERAL I FOR NOW OUR PLAN IS TO SET ASIDE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME GENERAL FUND IN TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE. TO BACK FOR THE STATE OR BECAUSE OF THESE CONSTRUCTION BY ALLOWING FOR THE THUNDER MADE SOLVENT WITHOUT REDUCING SERVICE LEVELS IN THE BUDGET YEAR WELL WE DEVELOP A PERMANENT SOLUTION TO PASS INSOLVENCY FOR ONLY THIS FUND. BUT OTHERS INCLUDING THE IMPROVEMENT. AND MODERNIZATION WHAT. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. SO I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE SAW ISSUE- AND THE L. A. OLD. THROUGHOUT A NUMBER OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FOR TEN YEARS US THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS- THAT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE HAVING PROBLEMS WITH. EITHER THE DEPARTMENT THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL OR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHY ARE WE NOT TRYING TO THINK MORE LONG TERM SOLUTION ESPECIALLY SENSE THESE FUNDS WOULD QUALIFY TO BE SELL EXCLUDABLE EXPENSES. I JUST TO REMIND FINANCED THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION I'M IT IS FAR AS ALL OF THE EXPENDITURES BEING CONSIDERED SALAS GLOBAL I WOULD HAVE TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THAT JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS THE CASE- AS FAR AS THAT THE STATE COURT FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND IT IS A PLAN THAT. WE HAVE BEEN MONITORING AND LAST YEAR WE GET ACTUALLY CONSOLIDATED THE TWO CORE CONSTRUCTION ON TO THE STATE CORPORATE SO HE'S CONSTRUCTION BUT ANY IMMEDIATE AND CRITICAL NEEDS ACCOUNT UP TO ALLOW FOR SOLVENCY IN THE- A CURRENT YOUR- CURRENTLY. AND THEN THE BUT YOU'RE TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE SO I'M MOVING FORWARD WITH OUR PLAN IS TO DO IS TO SET ASIDE THE FUNDING FOR THE BUDGET YEAR AND THEN ONCE WE MOVE FORWARD INTO THE FOLLOWING YEAR CONSIDER A SOLUTION. THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE MOVING OUT OF THIS NETWORK FACILITIES CONSTRUCTION FUND INTO THE GENERAL FUND- IN THE FUTURE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD- IN IN THE CURRENT YEAR WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO CONSISTENTLY MONITOR REVENUES THAT THIS COULD IMPROVE OUR KITCHEN THERE COULD BE LAST. REVENUE NEEDED BUT WE WANTED TO DEFER THIS OPTION SO WE CAN HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION UNTIL JUST THIS ISSUE POTENTIALLY. IN THE FALL. AND YOU. MAY IN YOUR PURSE IT DEPARTMENT TO FIND YOU BRIEFLY MENTIONING YOUR- PRESENTATION- AS A POSSIBILITY CONSIDERING CONVERTING THE FUNDING TO THE GENERAL FUND WHICH IS WHAT THE L. A- TALKED ABOUT IS SOMETHING THAT IS SERIOUSLY BEING CONSIDERED JUST. SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING AS A POSSIBILITY. I MEAN WORKING SINGLE SOLUTIONS ASK NICELY A POINT OUT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT BALANCE THERE- WHICH IT IT IS AN OPTION TO ADDRESS THE GENERAL FUND IT'S NOT JUST WHO DEPARTMENTS FINANCE SAYING THAT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD. HAVE TO LOOK INTO IT FURTHER. IT JUST SEEMS THAT GIVE AN IDEA OF PRESIDENTE SURPLUS THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW THAT THIS WOULD BE THE TIME TO FOCUS ON. NOT JUST TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUT THE LONG TERM- PROJECTIONS AND THE SHORTCOMINGS THAT WEHAVE- VERSUS AT A FUTURE WITH THAT'S NOT GUARANTEED. TO BE TO SEE THESE DISPENSED AGAIN. ON INTO FEELS LIKE A MISSED OPPORTUNITY FOR US. MR STONE. THANK YOU BATUM CHAIR IT ENDS THIS PROPOSAL A LOT OF WAYS JUST KINDA KICKED THAT CAN DOWN THE ROAD AND IF WE JUST. GET THE THIS ACCOUNT SOLVENTS FOR NOW THEN. THAT'S GOING TO LEAVE US WITH SIGNIFICANT QUESTIONS DOWN THE ROAD I WOULD FRANKLY RATHER SEE US COME UP WITH A BROADER PLAN FOR HOW WE ADDRESS. FACILITIES NEEDS NOW AND ON GOING AND THAT WOULD PUT INTO CONTEXT EXACTLY. THE BROADER PICTURE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT AND REMEMBER THAT WHAT OF THE JUDICIAL BRANCH BUDGET EVEN IF YOU LOOK AT THE PREVIOUS ACTION ITEM THE CERTAINLY THE NEXT ITEM IT'S REALLY BUILT ON. FINES AND FEES IN ORDER TO MAKE ENDS MEET AND- INSTEAD OF JUST REDUCING SOME OF THESE FINES AND FEES WE HAVE TO HAVE A PLAN FOR GETTING RID OF THESE FINES AND FEES THEIR INEQUITABLE IT IS THE WRONG WAY. TO BUILD THESE BUDGETS AND AN ACTUAL LIKE THIS GIVES THE LEGISLATURE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT ALL THE CONSTRUCTION PROPOSALS ARE SOME OF THESE HAVE BEEN LANGUISHING FOR DECADES. AND PRIORITIES THAT WERE SET DECADES AGO MAY NOT BE PRIORITIES NOW SO IF THIS WERE TO COME IN THE GENERAL FUND WHICH I THINK IS A LOT OF ONE GOAL. AND A PLAN TO DO THAT WOULD GIVE US MUCH MORE VISIBILITY INTO WHAT THEY'RE CONSTRUCTION NEEDS ARE. BE ABLE TO LEVERAGE MORE BROADLY. THE STATE'S. ABILITY TO LEVERAGE FIVE IT'S FINANCES. MANAGE SOME OF THIS DEBT AND HAVE US I DON'T KNOW THE SOLUTION SENT SHUDDERS DOWN THE SPINES OF EVERYBODY JUDICIAL COUNCIL BUT HAVE THE LEGISLATURE MORE INVOLVED IN DECISIONS ABOUT. WHERE COURT CONSTRUCTION IS HAPPENING WHERE THE DEMOGRAPHICS ARE DRIVING SOME OF THESE DCISIONS AS OPPOSED TO JUST SHORING UP FUNDS AND GOING WITH SOME SOME OUTDATED. PRIORITIES SO THIS SHIFT I THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE COULD REALLY START OUT NOW WE DO HAVE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATURE IS VERY INTERESTED. IN SOLVING. THE ISSUES MORE BROADLY ABOUT FINES AND FEES BUT ALSO GETTING ITS HANDS ARE. MORE FIRMLY AROUND WHERE SOME OF THIS MONEY IS BEING SPENT WHITES BEING SPENT WHAT SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE AND CLEARLY UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE NEED IS SO I THINK THAT PROPOSAL IS SOMETHING WE DEFINITELY SHOULD BE LOOKING AND WORKING ON AND I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A PATH TOWARDS MOVING TO PUT THESE CONSTRUCTION FUNDS INTO THE GENERAL FUND SO THAT WE HAVE MORE DIRECT ACCESS TO BE ABLE TO MANAGE THOSE AND HELP DIRECT PRIORITIES. MADAM CHAIR I MADE THIS IS WAS LACK OF THE RICHMOND COUNCIL. AND THAT- AND JUST WANT TO DESCRIBE JUST BRIEFLY ABOUT THE FISCAL ORGANIZATION. THAT S. YES YOU HAVE TO USE THE FUND THAT SAID GOOD QUESTION ABOUT THE SOLVENCY IT'S NOT PAY FOR ANY ADDITIONAL AND NEW. PROJECTS AND SO THIS IS VERY FUNDING THE EXISTING OBLIGATIONS OF THAT PARTICULAR FUND- ARE NOW FUTURE NEEDS FOR- INSTRUCTION ALONG HAVE A MISSED MCCORMICK TALK ABOUT THE- THE RESET- WE'VE- THROUGH. ONE BUT THAT IS NOW THE GENERAL FUND IS THE. THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR FUTURE. AND FUTURE. OPTIONS ARE GONNA TAKE A TO DIRECTOR- THE PROJECT ABOUT OUR RECENT READ LEGISLATIVELY MAN- REPORTERS OF OUR CONSTRUCTION. OKAY THANK YOU LIKABLE ABOUT CAR DIRECTOR PRISCILLA SERVICES IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE BROUGHT THE pREPORT- AT. REASSESSED ALL OF OUR CAPITAL PROJECT NEEDS WE- BASICALLY PULLED EVERY SINGLE- OF THE EVERYONE OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COURTS WE DEVELOPED A COURT FACILITIES PLAN SPECIFIC TO EACH COURT JURISDICTION. AND THEN AT A COMPREHENSIVE METHODOLOGY THAT WE WENT THROUGH TO RANK THESE PROJECTS TO PRIORITIZE THEM- WE ENDED UP WITH EIGHTY PROJECTS- IN TWENTY NINETEEN DOLLARS IT WAS ABOUT THIRTEEN POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF MEAT. AND WE'RE HAVE INCORPORATED THAT STATEWIDE LIST AS OUR FIVE YEAR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. IT HAVE BEEN- BEEN WORKING DOWN THAT LIST- IN TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO THE FUNDING SOURCES DID SHIFT FROM- THE. IMMEDIATE- DICKEL NEED ACCOUNT TO GENERAL FUND WHICH HAS- IS. THE FUNDING- SOURCES FOR THE CAPITAL PROJECTS BUT THEY HAVE BEEN PRIORITIZED- VERY METHODICALLY AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS. MR JOHNSON MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU- I'M KINDA CURIOUS ABOUT OUR I WAS CHAIR IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND I DO REMEMBER THE THESE LISTS AND- I THINK AT THE TIME- DURING THE REALLY BAD ECONOMIC TIMES THE LEGISLATURE TOOK QUITE A BIT OF YOU TOOK A HAIR CUT TO HELP BALANCE THE BUDGET. IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT. SIGNIFICANT HAIR CUT AT ALL IT AT THE TIME- THE GOVERNOR. BASICALLY HELP BALANCE THE BUDGET BY USING THIS AND I'M I'M NOT SURE IF WE EVER. I TRY TO GET AS MUCH LARGER CHINESE MUCH MONEY BACK INTO CONSTRUCTION FUNDS BUT PART OF PART OF MY- MY DILEMMA WAS- HAVING JUDGES. AND LAWYERS DO CONSTRUCTION- THAT WHEN I WAS DIRECTOR OF ASSET MANAGEMENT FOR THE CITY WHEN YOU HAD- POLICE AND FIRE AND LIBRARIANS HANDLING CONSTRUCTION. OF MOST THE TIMES THEY WERE OVER BUDGET AND THEY NEVER MET THE TIME LIMIT THAT THEY GAVE WHEN THEY WOULD COMPLETE THE PROJECT WHICH WAS TOTALLY IN AN EFFICIENT AND IN SOME CASES. MANAGERS HAD. BOB OFFICERS LARGER THAN COUNCIL OFFICES AND MAYOR'S OFFICES- IS EXTREMELY WASTE OF MONEY BUT ONCE WE GOT PUBLIC WORKS ENGINEERING INVOLVED AND PUT. A PUBLIC FOR ENGINEERS AND PROJECT MANAGERS INVOLVED WE HAVE TO GET IT ON. IN IN SOME KIND OF- UNDER CONTROL AND SO ARE PROJECTS FROM THAT POINT ON TO WORK ON TIME AND ON BUDGET. AND SO MY FIRST QUESTION IS. I'M LOOKING AT THESE NUMBERS. ABOUT THE APPROVED PROJECT BUDGET BUT IT DOESN'T GIVE YOU WHAT THE ORIGINAL. COSTS IT WAS SO I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IN ACOSTA MATERIALS GOING UP- YEAH YEAH YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE PLACE A LOT OF THE BLAME ON REDUCE REVENUES BUT WHAT ABOUT INCREASE COSTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME- WITH- EMBARGOES WITH. THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T MOVE GOODS AND SERVICES OUT OF THE PORT ALL OF THAT HAS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON ON YOUR CONSTRUCTION BOTTOM LINE- AND I DON'T. IT'S NOT REALLY REFLECTED. IN THIS- RIGHT NOW- I GUESS AS PART OF THE- AS PART OF YOUR PROBLEM OF HAVING SOMEONE. HAS BEEN HERE FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS US OWNERS BEEN HERE NOW FOR TEN YEARS ACTUALLY REMEMBER WHEN. THESE COSTS WERE A LOT DIFFERENT AND SO IF THERE'S A WAY YOU CAN GET TO MY OFFICE WITH THE ORIGINAL COST WITH THE- YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE DELTA BETWEEN WHAT YOU RAISING DAUGHTERS WOULD COST AND HOW ITS- HOUSING GROUND. BUT MOST IMPORTANT WHAT WAS THAT WAS THE REASON FOR THAT- BECAUSE AS THE MEMBERS ARE HERE ST NOW A WE'RE LOOKING AT THINGS THAT AT THE TIME RIGHT NOW. BUT WE MAY GO UP TO TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS WELL LIKE I COULD PROBABLY SAFELY SAY MOST PEOPLE HERE ALL OF US WILL BE GONE. AND WILL HAVE THE SAME DANCE AGAIN. WHERE YOU MAY BE ASKING FOR FOUR BILLION DOLLARS BUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. WON'T BE HERE AND NOBODY ASKING FOR MORE MONEY AND THIS JUST SEEMS TO KEEP GOING ON AND ON AND ON. LUCKILY MOST OF THE STATE'S. OR WHEN MOST OF US TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX TWENTY EIGHT. BUT EVEN THEN IT TWENTY FOUR YOU COULD COME BACK AND SAY WE NEED ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF FIVE YEARS AND SO I'M NOT. ONE OF THEM MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER THE ORIGINAL ESTIMATE WAS THAT YOU'RE STILL WITHIN THAT AND IF YOU'RE NOT WHETHER THOSE REASONS SO WE CAN PLAN TEN YEARS FROM NOW TO- FOR ANY THING THAT COULD COME UP. AND INTO- I'M- I THINK WE SHOULD BRING IT IN. AND THAT CAPACITY FOR JUDICIAL COUNCIL TO HANDLE THIS AND GET SOME ACTUAL CONSTRUCTION PROFESSIONALS. TO BE ON TOP OF THIS- WE HIRE ALL PROJECT MANAGERS. ALMOST LIKE INSPECTOR GENERAL TO OVERSEE THESE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT SHOULD HE COME IN ON TIME AND ON BUDGET AND GIVE THE LEGISLATURE SOME COMFORT. THAT THESE THAT THESE PROJECTS ARE BEING DONE ACCORDING TO OUR SPECIFICATIONS OF WHAT WE ARE ALLOCATING THE MONEY FOR AND THAT WEEK THAT THE MONIES ARE SPENT APPROPRIATELY. SO I WROTE THAT COULD BE THAT COULD BE DONE. I'M CERTAINLY THAT'S A VERY GOOD POINT ABOUT- CONSTRUCTION ESCALATION AS- THE- CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION INC INDEX HAS BEEN RUNNING UITE RAMPANT THE LAST YEAR OR TWO IT'S UP OVER FIFTEEN PERCENT- BUT WE DO HAVE A THE- UNIT OF PROFESSIONALS I AM A LICENSED PROFESSIONAL MYSELF AND HAVE BEEN DOING PROJECT MANAGEMENT FOR THIRTY YEARS- AND I DO HAVE A QUADRI. OF AT LEAST TWENTY- TO PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE ON STAFF WHO DO MANAGE THESE PROJECTS- WE WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ANDTHROUGH THE STATE PUBLIC WORKS FOR TO ENSURE THAT. OUR PROJECTS- SCOPES SCHEDULES AND BUDGETS ARE- IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS THAT THEY ARE GRANTED. AND WE DO ESCALATOR PROJECTS BASED ON CALIFORNIA CONSTRUCTION INDEX. JUGGLING OVER T. INDEX BY A LOT A LITTLE AND DO YOU DO CLAWBACKS IF THE CONTRACTOR IS NOT PERFORMING TO THE TO YOUR STANDARDS TOTALLY SHEER HIGH STANDARD DO YOU CLAW BACK SOME OF THAT TAXPAYER MONEY SO THAT WE CAN EITHER HIRE SOMEBODY ELSE IS GONNA GET THE JOB DONE QUICKER FASTER CHEAPER OR I MEAN WHAT KIND OF CONTROLS DO YOU HAVE OR DO YOU COME BACK TO US. AND JUST ASK FOR MORE MONEY. OF THE WE WATCH OUR BOTTOM LINE VERY CLOSELY AND- YOUR LIFE THE CONSTRUCTION AND ESCALATION SPECIALLY THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN- PROBLEMATIC BUT THE MAJORITY OF OUR PROJECTS HAVE BEEN RUNNING WITHIN BUDGETS WERE WITHIN THE- APPROPRIATIONS. WHEN WE'RE UNABLE TO- YEAH WE DO- VALUE ENGINEERING EXERCISES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THESE PROJECTS AWARDED AND- WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING THEM DELIVERED ON TIME. OKAY. IT ALSO BE IMPORTANT FOR THEM TO DEPARTMENTS TO EXPLAIN HOW THEY ARE INVOLVED AS PARTNERS WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON OUR ON OUR CONSTRUCTION PROGRAM ON THE NET WE DO FOLLOW THE RULES OR REGULATIONS AND ALL OTHER STATE ENTITIES ARE REQUIRED TO- TO FOLLOW UP TO ENSURE PROJECT DELIVERY WITHIN SCOPE AND BUDGET. AND ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NONE. WHAT THE COSTS ON. BYE BYE DO YOU HAVE TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBLE. THANK YOU LUCK OCCURRING ARRIVING OR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT'S OKAY IF I ADDRESS THAT QUESTION AS WELL. BUT THANK YOU M. JUDICIAL BRANCH HAS SEEN SOME INFLATION INCREASES HOWEVER THEY ARE IN LINE WITH WHAT WE'RE SEEING FOR CONSTRUCTION INFLATION ACROSS THE STATE IN LINE I WOULD SAY AT OR BELOW SO I THINK JUDICIAL BRANCHES DONE A REALLY GOOD JOB KEEPING THEIR PROJECTS WITHIN BUDGET AND THERE IS A PROCESS THROUGH THE CATHOLIC PROCESS. WHERE WE CAN AUGMENT UP 220% WHICH TO CENTRAL ST PUBLIC WORKS BOARD. WE HAVE TAPPED INTO THAT A COUPLE TIMES BUT NOT EXTENSIVELY. AND OUTSIDE OF THAT WE HAVE A FIVE YEAR PLAN WHICH IS PROPOSED THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WHICH SHOWS. OF THAT THIRTEEN POINT TWO BILLION THAT WAS PART OF THE ORIGINAL TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REASSESSMENT. HOW MANY OF THOSE WE PLAN ON TACKLING EACH YEAR AND THOSE COSTS ARE UPDATED IN THE FIVE YEAR PLANS YOU CAN SEE IF WE GET A PLANNING DOING PROJECT NUMBER EIGHT FOR EXAMPLE IN YOUR TO. YOU WOULD SEE WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY ESTIMATING THAT PROJECT TO BE SO OBVIOUSLY THOSE COSTS WILL INCREASE AS BE POSTPONED THEM OUT INTO THE FUTURE BECAUSE THERE IS A NORMAL INFLATION. INDEX THAT'S BUILT INTO THAT- AND THEN ALSO THE CONSTRUCTION PROJECT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW. AND AS A LEAD ADDRESSED ARE ON SCHEDULE. AND LOOKING TO BE COMPLETED SOON. AND DOING OUR BEST TO ADDRESS THE PROJECTS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN REASSESSMENT IN THE ORDER OF. PRIORITY THAT THEY WERE DRESSED AT THAT POINT TIME. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE. ANYONE ELSE. K. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT ISSUE IT IS A CIVIL ASSESSMENTS. JUST A REMINDER FINANCIAL BE PRESENTING ON THIS ISSUE. IN RECOGNITION OF THEIR CURRENT CIVIL ASSESSMENT FEE IS TOO HIGH THE BUDGET INCLUDES STATUTORY CHANGES TO REDUCE THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT FROM THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND INCLUDES FIFTY MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO BACK FILL THE RESULTING LOSS OF REVENUE FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. FURTHERMORE THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN COMMITTED TO PROVIDING FINANCIAL RELIEF FOR INDIVIDUALS FROM THE IMPOSITION OF FINES AND FEES LET BY STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. MORE SPECIFICALLY TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT EXPANDED THE ONLINE ABILITY A PILOT PROGRAM STATE WHY DO ALLOW INDIGENT AND LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS TO APPLY ONLINE TO HAVE THEIR FINES AND FEES FROM TRAFFIC AND NON TRAFFIC INFRACTIONS. REDUCED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR ABILITY TO PAY- EIGHTY ONE SEVENTY SEVEN FOR THE BUDGET TRAILER BILL ELIMINATED ABILITY OF STATE LOCAL AGENCIES TO IMPOSE CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES SUCH AS FEES TO COVER. THE MEASURE OF COSTS RELATED TO COLLECTION RESTITUTION AMONG OTHER TYPES BEGINNING JANUARY FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AND EIGHTY EIGHTEEN SIXTY NINE FROM TWENTY TWENTY ELIMINATED THE ABILITY OF STATE LOCAL AGENCIES TO IMPOSE CERTAIN ADMINISTRATIVE FEES FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES SUCH AS FEES IMPOSED TO RECOVER COSTS RELATED TO. PROVIDING PUBLIC DEFENSE AND PROFICIENT TO PROFICIENT I'M MORE THAN HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE IN THE HOUSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR STAFF COMPASS GREAT WITH POLICY ADVICE CLINIC UC. CA OF LAW WELL I COMMEND THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO REDUCE THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT FROM THREE HUNDRED TO A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS. IT SIMPLY DOES NOT GO FAR ENOUGH AS THE MATERIALS IN THE AGENDA NOW MOST CALIFORNIANS CANNOT AFFORD TO PAY THE SELF ASSESSMENT. BECAUSE OF TARGETED POLICING IN THE OVER SURVEILLANCE OF COMMUNITIES OF COLOR CIVIL SUBSTANCE DISPROPORTIONATELY FALL ON BLACK AND BROWN CALIFORNIANS AS THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE PULLED OVER. TICKETED AND ARRESTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND OUR RELIANCE ON CIVIL ASSASSINS IS ALSO- AS A SOURCE OF REVENUE HAS PROVEN UNSUSTAINABLE AND COSTLY. EACH YEAR COURTS CHARGED PEOPLE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE SELF ASSESSMENT AND YET THEY WERE COVER ONLY A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF WHAT THEY CHARGED% RANGING FROM 20% IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY 28% AND HUMBOLDT COUNTY. AND SUCH LOW RATES ARE NOT THE RESULT OF LACKS COLLECTION EFFORTS BUT RATHER BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE ORDERED TO PAY SIMPLY CANNOT. IN FACT OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS REVENUE FROM THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY- AND BY 36% SPECIFICALLY. SO CIVIL ASSESSMENTS ARE PERFORMING CALIFORNIANS AND IT'S PROVING TO BE AN UNRELIABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE SO WHAT. PURPOSE IS THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT SURVEYING. THE LEGISATURE AUTHORIZED SUPPOSED ABSENCE FOR FAILURE TO APPEAR CASES BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FIVE I'M AN EXPANDED THAT IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX TO APPLY TO FIGURE TO PAY CASES WITH THE IDEA THAT. THE ABILITY TO IMPOSE CIVIL ASSESSMENTS WOULD IMPROVE THE COURT'S ABILITY TO COLLAPSE ON THESE FINES. BUT CHARGING PEOPLE ADDITIONAL FEES LIKE CIVIL ASSESSMENTS DOES NOTHING TO ENCOURAGE OR SUPPORT SOMEONE IN PAYING THEIR FACE FINES. IN FACT THE SURVEY OF PEOPLE WHO WERE ORDERED TO PAY CIVIL ASSESSMENTS 73% OF PEOPLE SAID THEY WEREN'T EVEN AWARE THAT THEY COULD BE CHARGED A FEE FOR MISSING A DEADLINE TO PAY OR APPEARING IN COURT. THIS QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS A TOOL THAT IS ACTUALLY INFLUENCING BEHAVIOR. THEY'RE ALSO MORE HUMANE AND PROVEN EFFECTIVE TOOLS. LIKE TEXT MESSAGE REMINDERS TO HELP INSURE- PEOPLE SHORT COURT OR CHE AND ALSO AS- OF X. CON. LIKE AND OF. OUT AND SANCTIONED COLLECTION. THAT COURTS HAVE THEIR TO WHICH BLACK OF THE- OR PAYMENT- WHICH WHY REFER THE POSH. OF REPEAL A THE FULL HUNDRED AND BE APPROACHED WITH SKEPTICISM- I KNOW MR MEAN I'VE MENTIONED THE ABILITY TO PAY PILOT PROGRAMS WHICH ARE BUT SOON TO BE SCALED A STATE WIDE. BUT THIS PACKAGE STILL LEAVES ROOM FOR WIDE DISCRETION AND TURN BIAS PARTICULARLY WHEN WE KNOW THAT CIVIL ASSESSMENTS REVENUE WAS MEANT TO FIND TROUT. OPERATIONS TO FOR EXAMPLE IN SOLANO COUNTY AFTER A DAY IMPLEMENTED AN ABILITY TO PAY PROCESSING SPONSORED SETTLEMENT- DATA SHOW THAT EVEN IN CASES WHERE THE COURT HAD DECIDED EXPLICITLY THAT A PERSON COULD NOT AFFORD TO PAY. A REDUCED ALL OTHER FINES AND FEES THE COURT STILL IMPOSED THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT IN 97% OF CASES. SO IN SHORT NOT ONLY OUR CIVIL ASSESSMENTS NOT MEETING THEIR INTENDED GOALS ARE HARMFUL AND COSTLY CALIFORNIANS. UNDER THERE JUST SIMPLY MORE EQUITABLE AND HUMANE WAYS TO ENCOURAGE COURT APPEARANCE IN PAYMENT I DO NOT PENALIZE POPPY. HM THANK YOU UP FOR THE- DEPARTMENT OF. HOW DID HE LAND ON THIS 50% REDUCTION Y. ENTRE FIFTY S. IS THAT. DO YOU HAVE A RESEARCHER SCIENCE TELLING US THAT. SOMEONE IS PERSONABLE TO PAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS VERSUS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. HI THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION NOT JUST YOUR ONLINE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. HELLO WE FEEL THAT A 50% REDUCTION STRIKES A BALANCE OF PROVIDING THE IMMEDIATE DISCREETLY FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS IN A PRESERVE THE VIABILITY OF THE SENATE CIVIL SESSION BEING AS IT USED AS A TOOL TO KEEP INDIVIDUALS ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE THAT THEY SHOW UP FOR THEIR COURT PROCEEDINGS. AND PAY THEIR FINES I THOUGHT I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT THE SIMPLE ASSESSMENT IS USED AS A TOOL INSTEAD OF MORE INTRUSIVE ACTIONS SUCH AS THE ISSUANCE OF BENCH WARRANTS WHICH- DENATURATION PRACTICALLY DOESN'T WANT TO REVERT BACK TO. IN ADDITION I ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT WE HAVE THE DESTRUCTION HAS CONSIDERED THE OTHER ALTERNATIVES- REFERENCE BY MR BUSH SPOKE ABOUT THE UNUSUAL TO BUY EXTENSION AS WELL AS- USING OTHER FORMS OF WAGE GARNISHMENT BANK LEVEES YOU KNOW AS WE AS WE CONSIDERED- GOING WITH THE APPROACH OF PROBABLY EXTENSION. WHICH WAS AT THAT PARTY CAN BE USED BY TRIAL COURTS BUT WE JUST HAVE CONCERNS THAT THIS COULD RESULT IN ACCESS TO JUSTICE ISSUES BECAUSE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE NON RESPONSIVE WOULD BE FOUND GUILTY WITHOUT FORMAL DEAL JUDICIAL REVIEW. IN THE DEFENDERS KNOWLEDGE- IT IS FIRST THE OTHER POTENTIAL TO NEED TO BE LOOKING TO I THINK WAGE GARNISHMENT BANK LEVEES- WE BELIEVE THAT YOU IN GENERAL DRAFTING INDIVIDUALS COUNT CAN RESULT OVER DRAFT NECESSITY FEES WHICH COULD RESULT IN SOME CASES EQUAL OR EVEN EXCEED MISSILE ASSESSMENT THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE IMPOSED. WE SHOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THIS IS ALREADY AN OPTION FOR EXCUSE BUT THIS IS ONLY FOR ONE INDIVIDUALS HAVE FINANCIAL PENALTIES IF WE ELIMINATED THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT WHICH GARNISHMENT BANK LEVIES CANNOT BE USED BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE NOT. BE A FINANCIAL PENALTY O COLLECT ON. SO KEEP HE DIDN'T ANSWER MY THERE IS HOW THE FACT THAT THE HAVE POINT WITH VERY AND THAT GONNA SAY. HELP LOW INCOME CAN OF I WOULD SAY THAT- HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS IS STILL TOO MUCH FOR MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND SO WE ARE BALANCING BUDGETS ON THE BACKS OF OUR LOWEST INCOME COMMUNITY MEMBERS THAT WE KNOW ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY TARGETED- BYE BYE SYSTEM INSISTS AS WE ENTER TWENTY TWENTY TWO WITH EQUITY AT THE FOREFRONT OF ALL THE THINGS WE DO IT IT'S NOT CLEAR WHY WE ARE SAYING HALF WAYVERSUS JUST ELIMINATED IT COMPLETELY AND FINDING A BETTER WAY TO HAVE A STABLE RESOURCES FOR OUR PORTS ARE AND HE FOCUSED A LOT OF ALTERNATIVES BUT- I WILL SAY THAT ONE OF OUR PANELISTS ARE ENOUGH WITH THE SOMETHING THAT WAS REALLY SIMPLE AND A TEXT MESSAGE. I TO REMIND PEOPLE THAT THERE'S NOTHING THAT WE NEED TO. GO TO A- YOU. NEED TO BE- TO- TO WOREDA THIS AND SO. CAN WE GO BACK TO MY INITIAL QUESTION HOW DID YOU COME UP WITH A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS BEING FAIR AND REASONABLE. AND WE WANTED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL RELIEF- Q. INDIVIDUALS TO RALLY IN WE HAD SETTLED ON A 50% REDUCTION FOR THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT ON. ALSO WENT WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REDUCTIONS IN THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT IS ALSO A FACTOR ALONGSIDE BROADER PROGRAMS OUT ONLINE ABILITY TO PAY EXPANSION- THROUGH USE OF THE TOOL IN THE FUTURE- WHEN INDIVIDUALS APPLY FOR ONLINE ABILITY TO PAY DETERMINATION IT WILL CONSTITUTE AN APPEARANCE BOOK WHICH WILL RESTRICT WHICH WILL FURTHER REDUCE THE NEED FOR SIMPLE SYSTEM TO BE ISSUED. IF I'M STRUGGLING FOR SIMPLE THINGS LIKE. PUTTING GAS IN MY CAR WHICH IS LESS THAN A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS I DON'T SEE HOW INDIVIDUALS THAT BELIEVE THAT THAT YOU ARE. THEY ARE WISHING TO DO AND SERVE RELIEF IS OUR GOAL WHY ARE WE NOT WORKING TO ELIMINATE THIS FEEL TOGETHER AND COME UP WITH THE MORE STABLE SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR OUR COURTS. IT'S- YES SIR I THINK YOU CAN QUESTION I JUST GETTING BACK TO LOOK TO MY INITIAL COMMENTS IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT BEING A REVENUE SOURCE IT'S ABOUT HAVING HAVING SOMETHING THERE WHEN INDIVIDUAL FAILS TO APPEAR OR FAILS TO PAY THEIR FINES AS I HAD MENTIONED WITH THE IF WE POTENTIALLY REMOVE THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT FEE THERE ARE MORE INTRUSIVE ACTIONS THAT COULD BE TAKE THAT COULD TAKE PLACE. SUCH AS THE ISSUE WITH THE BENCH WARRANTS FOR ONE INDIVIDUALS AREN'T HEARING SUPPORT THAT IS IT BUT FRANKLIN ACTION WE DO NOT WANT TO OCCUR AND WE BELIEVE THE CIVIL ASSESSMENT TO BE LESS INTRUSIVE THAN THE ISSUE THE TOPIC WENT ST JUST A REVENUE ISSUE IT'S ALSO A STRUCTURAL ISSUE OF WHICH REFORM CHANGE TO TAKE PLACE- THE ADMINISTRATION IS OPEN TO LISTENING TO ALTERNATIVES THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS TO BRING UP I'M ALSO THERE THERE IS WORK BEING DONE IN A TEXT REMINDER SPHERE. BUT THAT DOESN'T GET OUT THE INHERENT ISSUE OF- AREN'T COMPELLING INDIVIDUALS INTO COURT LIKE THE TAX IS NOT GOING TO NECESSARILY REQUIRED THE INDIVIDUALS. TO SHOW UP TO COURT ITSELF. IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT THIS IS COMPELLED TO FEED SOMETHING COMPELLED THE VIGILS AND I WILL CALL YOUR TRAIN OF THOUGHT THOUGH. SO THIS. BUT WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IS ACCURATE THEN WHY HAVE WE ELIMINATED OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE CRIMINAL FEES- AND MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH THAT QUESTION AGAIN I WOULD MAKE SURE SHE DOES APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION ON THIS ISSUE I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THOSE FEES ARE CHARGED BY. LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND STATE GOVERNMENT THIS FEET SPECIFICALLY CHARGED BY PORTS FOR THE SPECIFIC PURPOSE OF WHEN IT WILL APPEAR OR FAILS TO PAY OFF. ON IT UNDERSTANDABLY IS MISS MISS CAMPUS OF BILLY HAS POINTED OUT THAT THESE FEES DO YOU HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS AND THAT THAT'S WHY WE'RE ONE OF THE REASONS WE'RE TRYING TO. LOWER THE FEE- HERE SPECIFICALLY- BUT BIG BECAUSE HOW THIS FEAT IT IS DRIVEN ENGINEERS TO COMPEL INDIVIDUALS TO COME INTO COURT WE FIND IT POSSIBLE SAYS AND IT CAN BE LESS INTRUSIVE. THAN ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD BE RELIED UPON IF WE GOT RID OF IT. IF THIS WAS HAS BEEN WE'RE ELIMINATED THERE COULD BE AND I I'M NOT SURE HOW TRUMP WORKS. ON THERE IS JUDICIAL INDEPENDENCE THEY COULD ISSUE BENCH WARRANTS TO COMPEL INDIVIDUALS TO GO TO WANT TO GO. OUT BEFORE. YEAH SO IT'S MY- THOUGH THE- WE WERE NOT. A LOT THESE HE SAID SO IT'S NOT COME IN THE- TO PAY LEVELS THE GOAL THIS TO BE A THAT IS THE WORKING AND NEED TO FIGURE SOMETHING TO. SO I WILL SAY THAT MAYBE FOR SOME OF US WHO WERE. IN THE- ADMINISTRATION ARE HERE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS THINGS MORE PALATABLE THAN THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. BUT WHEN YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO LIVING OFF OF FIVE TEN DOLLARS TODAY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS SAYS THE SCREEN JUST AS IMPOSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT. OUT THERE AND SO I DO HOPE THAT WE FIND A WAY TO BOTH- ELIMINATED HE'S COMPLETELY FIND BETTER WAYS TO INCENTIVIZE INDIVIDUALS SHOW UP. AND THEN ALSO FIND SOME STABILITY FOR THE FOR THE REVENUE FOR THE COURTS WHICH THEY THINK SOMETHING. THAT THEY WOULD APPRECIATE GIVEN OUR LAST DISCUSSION- I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND HAND IT OFF TO MICHAEL IS THE ONE AFTER THAT. THE EIGHTH THAT'S RIGHT AGREE WITH YOU THESE ARE SORT OF OUTDATED UNPROVEN AND HAVE SUCH A DISPARATE IMPACT THAT. THIS IS THE TIME WE COULD BE TAKING BOLDER STEPS TO REALLY ENSURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING JUSTICE IN AN APPROPRIATE MANNER ACROSS THE BOARD. SO THE I THINK IT IS TIME TO ELIMINATE THE CITY'S. YEAH YES IT JUST FEELS THAT. THE SPEED SEVEN AWAY TO NORMALIZE SOME OF OUR- A SYSTEM IN OUR SYSTEM HERE AND NOT BE AWARE THAT SO I DO HOPE THAT US AS THE YEAR PROCEED TO FIND A WAY TO GET MORE CREATIVE AND ELIMINATE THE SPEAKS IT IS A TOP PRIORITY. FOR THIS COMMITTEE THIS YEAR. NOT SEEN THAT IN MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO. OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES IN ISSUE NUMBER FIVE WHICH IS THE EXPANSION OF ALL YES. MADAM SURE GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- PRETTY WICKED MARC ELRICH DIRECTOR OF THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. OF COURSE IS ONE THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR PARTNERSHIP AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT AND DISCUSS A LITTLE BIT TODAY ABOUT THE PROPOSALS WE HAVE IN THE BUDGET BEFORE YOU. THIS IS A POINTED REMINDER KALAYEH SERVICE AS THE STATE'S LEADERSHIP POP DURING ALL MAJOR EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. THIS INCLUDES RESPONDING TO DIRECTING% AND COORDINATING THE STATE AND FEDERAL RESOURCES OF MUTUAL LATE ASSETS. ACROSS THE REGION TO SUPPORT THE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES.-ACROSS THE STATE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT REALLY CALIFORNIA HAS MOVED INTO A NEW CHAPTER FOR EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT AND DISASTER RESPONSE AND RECOVERY. EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS ARE MORE FREQUENT. COMPLICATED AND OFTEN INVOLVING MULTIPLE COUNTIES AND REGIONS. OF THE STATE AT THE SAME TIME. THE EVACUATION OR DISPLACEMENT AND SUBSEQUENT SUPPORT OF PEOPLE OVER THE COURSE OF DAYS OR WEEKS HAS BECOME COMMONPLACE. OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS THE STATE HAS EXPERIENCED UNPRECEDENTED NUMBER OF AMERICAN CHEESE AND DISASTERS INCLUDING SEVERE DROUGHT. CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES POWER GRID OUTAGES. EARTHQUAKES INTENSIVE STORMS FLOODING CIVIL UNREST AND OF COURSE THE UNPRECEDENTED CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IN FACT FIFTEEN OF THE MOST DESTRUCTIVE FIRES IN THE STATE'S HISTORY HAVE OCCURRED SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WITH SEVEN OF THOSE OCCURRING IN THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE. CALIFORNIA WILL BE RECOVERING FROM THESE COMPLEX DISASTERS POINTLESS THE NEXT DECADE WILL CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO NEW AND FUTURE DISASTERS. IN FACT THERE IS NO DAY THAT GOES BY NOW THEY CAL HELLO YES IS NOT DIRECTLY RESPONDING TO A NEW EVENT MANAGING- AN EXISTING OPERATION OR IS ACTIVELY WORKING WITH ONE OF OUR COUNTIES OR CITIES ARE RECOVERING. WELL A PAST ASTOR. THE SCOPE AND SCALE OF THE NEED AT- YES AS ROLE HAS EXPANDED EXPONENTIALLY. BY STAFF RECENTLY MET WITH THE L. A- TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE BUDGET GROWTH THEY REPORTED IT THEIR ANALYSIS. WHILE WE UNDERSTAND HOW THEY ARRIVED AT THE 11009% GROWTH IT REPORTED. WHEN WE ACCOUNT FOR THE ONE TIME AUGMENTATIONS PROVIDED BY THE LEGISLATURE OUR ACTUAL PERMIT GROWTH. AS ACTUALLY BEEN 87% AND STILL LEAVES A SHORT ON WHAT IS NEEDED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF TODAY AND IN THE FUTURE. LAST YEAR WE WERE BEFORE YOU DISCUSSING THE CHICK CHANGING AND WORSENING DISASTER LANDSCAPING CALIFORNIA. AND THE CHALLENGES WE FACE TOGETHER. YOU RECOGNIZE THE NEED AND WITH YOUR SUPPORT WE MADE INVESTMENTS. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN CREATING A STRONGER HELLO YES FINANCING IN SHORING UP KEY AREAS. A DEDICATED RESOURCES DEDICATING RESOURCES WIKIPEDIA DISASTER RESPONSE TO RECOVERY EFFORTS INCLUDING. ESTABLISHING A PER MINUTE WHAT WE CALL INCIDENT SUPPORT TEAM. IN THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER THIS IS A FULL TIME. STATE OPERATIONS CENTER COMMITTED STAFF. AND AN INCIDENT MANAGEMENT TEAM. RESPONDED TO THE FIELD TO SUPPORT OUR REGIONAL OPERATIONS IN THE COUNTIES. TO MAINTAIN BETTER SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND MORE QUICKLY RESPOND TO AND SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE. AND IN DOING SO OF COURSE LESS THAN OUR PREVIOUS RELIANCE ON REDIRECTING STAFF. AN OLDER MODEL THAT WAS REALLY NOT SUSTAINABLE. I TO MEET TODAY'S DEMANDS. I AND THEN WE ALSO EXT. OUR RECOVERY. TO RESTORE- AND RAPIDLY REBUILD COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED BY DISASTER. WHETHER FROM FLOOD EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER NATURAL HUMAN COST DISASTER AND OF COURSE WILDFIRES. UP OF WHICH WE HAVE SEEN EVERY YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE CATASTROPHIC IMPACT AND LOSS FROM WILDFIRE IN OUR COMMUNITIES IN FACT SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AT LEAST FIFTY THOUSAND. HOMES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY A WILDFIRE IN OUR STATE. THESE ARE ALL IN COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED. OF POST DISASTER SIGNIFICANT- YES DISASTER RECOVERY ASSISTANCE YEAR WERE CRITICAL TO HELP BUILD A FOUNDATION THAT SET US ON A PATHWAY TO BETTER RESPOND TO AND RECOVER FROM WHAT I CALL THE NEW NORM. WE ARE FACING. THAT WAS A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION WE'VE CONTINUE TO REVIEW OUR CAPABILITIES OVER THE LAST YEAR HAVE IDENTIFIED ADDITIONAL WE- REQUIREMENTS. IN THIS VERY DIVERSE ORGANIZATION THE BILL ARE COMPREHENSIVE- YES THAT REFLECTS AND MEETS THE NEEDS OF OUR STATE. THE PROPOSALS FOR YOU TODAY NOW FOCUSED ON ENHANCING CALIFORNIA'S MUTUAL AID SYSTEM. IN SUPPORT OF OUR COMMUNITIES UP OUR DISASTER LOGISTICS EFFORT. AND OUR OVERALL AGENCY SUPPORT CAPACITY. IN THE- NEXT THREE PROPOSALS WHICH WERE BEFORE YOU THE FIRST BEING. INCREASING SUPPORT CAPACITY THIS IS A BUDGET. THAT PROPOSES FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND. FOR MILLION IN FEDERAL FUNDS AND TWO HUNDRED THIRTEEN THOUSAND SPECIAL FUNDS. FOR SEVENTY ONE POSITIONS- ACROSS THE ORGANIZATION TO INCREASE ADMINISTRATIVE AND PROGRAM SUPPORT BY THE DEPARTMENT. THIS IS A TRUE UP OF CRITICAL AND NECESSARY POSITIONS THAT PROVIDE THE CAPACITY CAUGHT THE AUDIENCE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE ACROSS THE AGENCY. THESE POSITIONS INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE SPECIALIST IN OUR FINANCIAL OPERATIONS AUDIT TEAM LEGAL COMMUNICATIONS AND RESPONSIBLE ITS ACTIONS. AS A DEPARTMENT THAT IS RESPONSIBLE HAVE EXPECTS MONTH RESPONSIBILITIES HAVE EXPANDED. AT AS SUCH SO HAS THE TREMENDOUS WORKLOAD REQUIREMENTS IN THESE AREAS A LOT OF THIS IS ALSO BACK OFFICE AND SORT OF SUSTAINMENT CAPABILITIES BURKE HOT IT WOULD BE OF OUR OPERATIONS. THE SECOND IS ADDRESSING OUR LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT WORKLOAD. THE BUDGET FOR FOUR POINT NINE MILLION GENERAL FUND TWENTY ONE POSITION LOGISTICS AND PLANNING BRANCH. TRANSPORT MASON EXECUTES LOGISTIC SUPPORT REQUIREMENTS DURING AND FOLLOWING MAJOR INCIDENTS EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS SUCH AS FOR EXAMPLE BUILDING AT SUPPORTING OPERATIONAL STAGING AREAS AND BASE CAMPS AND MANAGING COORDINATING AND FACILITATING THE DELIVERY OF PP ACROSS THE STATE TO OUR COMMUNITIES TO OUR SCHOOLS TO OUR- PRIVATE SECTOR PARTNERS WORK. ESTABLISHING VACCINATIONS ARE TESTING SITES- AS THEY DID DURING THE PANDEMIC OF COURSE SUPPORTING EMERGENCY SHELTER AND DISASTER HOUSING CAPABILITIES AFTER ONE OF OUR COMMUNITY SUFFERS A CATASTROPHIC LOSS. REALLY THE ONLY THIS DISASTER LOGISTICS SECTION HAS BEEN A CRITICAL RESOURCE CAPABILITY YEAH ARE ALL HAS ITS MISSION AND WHILE WE S. AS A WHOLE IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY BUSY. THAT THIS ABSOLUTE JUST EXPLODES I HAS BEEN ONE OF THE BUSIEST AREAS OF- YES OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE NEXT IS MISSION TASKING APPROPRIATION. OF TELLING US IS CURRENTLY AUTHORIZED TO MISSION TASK OTHER STATE AGENCIES TO RESPOND TO EMERGENCIES. THE LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED AN EXISTING APPROPRIATION TO COVER THE COST. OF THESE DEPARTMENTS WHEN MISSION PASSED YOU'RE A DECLARED EMERGENCIES. THE FUND IS DUE TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION DOLLARS ONGOING GENERAL FUND TO PROVIDE FUNDING TO STATE. ENTITIES BASICALLY WHEN WE- MISSION CAST THEM FOR COSTS INCURRED INCURRED. AS A RESULT OF THE TASKING. SHOULD SEPARATE THE STATE AGENCY'S RESPONSE CAPABILITIES WHEN TIME MATTERS MOST. INCLUDING THOSE NOT COVERED UNDER A GOVERNOR'S PROCLAIM STATE OF EMERGENCY. THIS IS REALLY WHERE WE HAVE A CRITICAL ASSET CRITICAL OF THAT. ARE THAT. WE CAN RAPIDLY MOVE A STATE AGENCY. THE ONLY- RECKON. THAT THE LEGISLATURE REJECT THIS MISSION TASKING APPROPRIATION PROPOSAL GIVEN THAT THERE IS AN EXISTING PROCESS FOR AUGMENTING THE DEPARTMENT'S BUDGET. THAT IS TRUE. I DID IS THE LONG TERM PROCESS FOR GOING BACK AND AFTER THE EVENT IS ALL OVER. HOWEVER THE INTENT OF THIS PROPOSAL IS TO RESPOND. PROFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY DURING DISASTERS TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES IMMEDIATELY AT HAND FOR EXAMPLE THIS FUNDING COULD BE USED TO TASK OTHER STATUS USED TO RESPOND TO A FIRE A TSUNAMI OR OTHER DISASTER WHERE A FORMAL DISASTER DECLARATION HAS NOT YET BEEN MADE. IT COULD ALSO BE UTILIZED TO SECURE SCARCE RESOURCES THAT MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE FORBASIC REASONS THAT DO NOT INVOLVE THE PARTICULAR DISASTER. FOR EXAMPLE OVER THE SUMMER CHALLENGES TO THE FUEL TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM RESULTED IN PROBLEMS IN GETTING NECESSARY FUEL TO KEEP FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT OPERATIONAL- YES MISSION PASSED THE CALIFORNIA MILITARY DEPARTMENT. TO RESPOND BY CONNECTING JET. IT'S COULD BE I CONNECTING JET A FUEL FROM OTHER SOURCES IN THE STATE. AIR TANKER BASES SO FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT COULD CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE FIRES RATHER THAN BE GRANTED AT A CRITICAL TIME. THESE ARE THE VARIOUS PROPOSALS THAT ARE IN FRONT OF THIS TIME AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU. SENATOR MEMBERS OF COMPUTERS WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I BELIEVE I'M NEXT ON THE PANEL IS DEDICATED PROCEED. YES THANK YOU I'M THE FIRST I WANTED TO START WITH OUR OFFICES OVER ARCHING COMMENTS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON- ALL OF THE GOVERNOR'S FOR FIVE PROPOSALS FOR- WE ASK AS THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME CONTEXT FOR A RECOMMENDATION FIND TWO OF THE THREE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM ON AS WELL AS OTHER PROPOSALS A LEADER IN THE H. AND AT. SO IN TERMS OF OUR OVER ARCHING COMMENTS. ON B. SUPPORT THE BASE SUPPORT BUDGET FOR- YES HAS INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. YOUR AGENDA SUMMARIZES THIS AND SOME OF THESE DOCUMENTATIONS ON PAGE FIFTEEN. AND HE EIGHTEEN APPEARANCE AND THAT INCLUDES A CHART FROM OUR REPORT ON THIS ISSUE. THAT SUMMARIZES THE THREE CENT INCREASES. WITH ECONOMIC BE ON THE SUPPORT FOR- WE ASK HAS ROUGHLY DOUBLED SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. AB WHICH IT WAS THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN I YEAR WAS SORT OF THE FIRST VERY LARGE WILDFIRE HERE THAT THE STATE EXPERIENCED. I'M KICKING OFF BECAUSE I'VE BEEN BACK TO BACK YEARS AS A HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF EMERGENCIES. I WAS A LITTLE TOO UNDER OUR METHODOLOGY FOR CALCULATING THE INCREASE IN- YESS THE B. SUPPORT BUDGET WE SHELL OUT ONE HUNDRED AND 9% INCREASE FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO THE CURRENT YEAR. I'M ATHLETIC DIRECTOR MENTIONED AND- WE ASK CALCULATED THAT THESE AS SAME TIME FRAME USING A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT METHODOLOGY AND THEY SHOW UP ROUGHLY 90% INCREASE. ON THE END OF FUNDING- FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO THE CURRENT YEAR AND SO IT REALLY IN OUR VIEW IS SORT OF THE METHODOLOGY USED IN THAT SPECIFIC NUMBER DOESN'T REALLY MATTER THAT MUCH ON AS- UNDER BOTH APPROACHES OF LOOKING AT THIS. AND P. SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENT HAS ROUGHLY DOUBLED I'M IN THE LAST. QUARTER SO YEARS. I ADDITION WE KNOW WE ARE THE STAFF LEVEL THAT ALSO INCREASE THE- DURING THE SAME TIME CREATED. I'M GROWING BY ABOUT 66% ON THE BOTTOM PROPOSED BUDGET WOULD FURTHER INCREASE BASED FUNDING AND STAFFING FOR- YES. I WE THINK THAT IT'S REASONABLE TO CONSIDER INCREASING THE STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY ANALYTE AT THE HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF EMERGENCIES THE STATE HAS SEEN IN RECENT YEARS. I'M AND THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS HEIGHTENED LEVEL OF EMERGENCIES CONTINUES INTO THE FUTURE I'M HOWEVER WE FIND THE L. YES MAY NOT BE DOING SO IN THE MOST STRATEGIC MANNER. FIRST EVERY ASPECT THE STOCKING PLAN AND SO THE DEPARTMENT STAFFING NEEDS IN THE NEAR TERM AND LONGER TERM AND CLEAR. THE ABSENCE OF CLEARLY IDENTIFIED STAFFING NEEDS I'VE BEEN IN THE DEPARTMENT REQUESTING POSITIONS FOR SIMILAR FUNCTIONS EACH YEAR. I'M FOR EXAMPLE THAT APARTMENT HI I'M HAS REQUESTED POSITIONS FIGHTING OVER TIME FOR ITS EMPLOYEES AND NEEDING MORE STAFF AND THEN. AND THEN THEN THE NEXT YEAR YOU'RE AFTER REQUESTING OPPOSITION FOR AT THE SAME RESOURCE FOR THIS AFTER THIS WITH THE SAME RATIONALE THIRTY INDICATING THAT PRIOR REQUEST MAY NOT HAVE BEEN. SUFFICIENT TO ADDRESS THEIR NEEDS. HI WHICH RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT THESE CURRENT REQUESTS. I'M A FURTHER WE FIND THE- YES IS PROPOSALS ARE NOT TIED TO ANY SPECIFIC EMERGENCY RESPONSABLES OR OBJECTIVES WHICH MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE PROPOSALS. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH THEY WILL ENHANCE THE STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY ARE WE WOULDN'T KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRED YES I IN CONJUNCTION WITH CAL FIRE TO. CONDUCT AN ASSESSMENT AT THE STATE'S ON WILDFIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY AND ESTABLISHES GOALS AND IDENTIFY GAPS AND WEAKNESSES AS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET AND BACKGROUND ASSESSMENT. WAS NEVER COMPLETED. SO IN OF THE I'M RECOMMENDED WOULD A ORDER TO ENSURE THE STATE IS PREPARED TO ADDRESS. ONGOING INCREASES IN NUMBER. IN AN EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE ADMINISTRATION TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ENHANCING ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITIES. AND SUBMIT THIS PLAN TO THE LEGISLATURE BY JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. OUR WE RECOMMEND THAT THE PLAN INCLUDES FOUR COMPONENTS AND ASSESSMENT AT THE EXISTING CAPACITY. I CAN I THINK HE SHOULD HAVE SPECIFIC GOALS AND OBJECTIVES FOR EMERGENCY. RESPONSE CAPACITY AND CAPABILITIES. I WEAKNESS AND GAPS THE STATE'S CURRENT ABILITY TO MEET THOSE GOALS AND OBJECTIVES. AND STAFFING NEEDS FOR ONLY ASK ANAHIT STRATEGY FOR OUTLINING STAFFING- THAT'S CORRECT THE STAFFING PLAN COMPONENT. SUCH A STRATEGIC PLAN WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE DETERMINED THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXISTING LBS CAPACITY IS INSUFFICIENT AND WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION SCHOOLS AND A CRAZY AND PRIORITIES ALIGN WITH THE LEGISLATURE SYMBOLS I'M PRIORITIES. AND I AM GONNA TURN OFF MY VIDEO SAME HERE YOU GUYS ARE HAVING SOME. DIFFICULTY HEARING. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME NOW AND- SO JUST TO CONTINUE IDEALLY L. YES WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE RECOMMEND ESTABLISHING EMERGENCY RESPONSABLES AND ASSESSING CURRENT CAPABILITIES AS WE RECOMMEND IN THE PLAN OUR INTERNAL TO THE PERMISSION OF L. YES HOWEVER- YES HAS BEEN UNABLE TO CONDUCT THE SIMILAR AND MORE NARROWLY SCOPED ASSESSMENT OF WILDFIRE RESPONSE CAPACITY. THAT WAS REQUIRED AS PART OF THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET PACKAGE. GIVEN THIS WE RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE PASCAL YES I DURING THESE BUDGET HEARINGS WHETHER IT'S ABLE TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN FOR ENHANCING EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY BEFORE TASKING L. YES WITH DURING CELL IF THE LEGISLATURE TAKES OUR RECOMMENDATION. THIS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE- YES THE OPPORTUNITY TO INDICATE WHAT RESOURCES IT MIGHT NEED TO DEVELOP A STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE RECOMMEND. TO THE EXTENT THAT WE DEVELOPING A PLAN THE LEGISLATURE COULD ASK- YES TO RECOMMEND ALTERNATIVE ENTITIES THAT WOULD BE BETTER SUITED TO DEVELOP A PLAN. IN TERMS OF OUR OVER ARCHING RECOMMENDATIONS WE ALSO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THAT THE HELL YES BASED BUDGET BE REPEALED AFTER THE COMPLETION OF THE STRATEGIC PLAN THAT WE RECOMMEND. SUCH A REVIEW WOULD DETERMINE THE EXTENT TO WHICH EXISTING RESOURCES ARE MEETING THE GOALS IN THE STRATEGIC PLAN. WHETHER SOME RESOURCES SHOULD BE RE ALLOCATED TO HIGHER PARTY USES. AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH RESTOCK MEDICATIONS HAVE ALREADY PROVIDED THE NECESSARY RESOURCES. THIS BASED BUDGET REVIEW COUPLED WITH THE STRATEGIC PLAN WOULD ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE THE INFORMATION HE NEEDS TO DETERMINE HOW TO ALLOCATE FUNDS. TO ENHANCE THE STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY IN THE MOST EFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE MANNER IN FUTURE YEARS. NOW IN TERMS OF SPECIFIC PROPOSALS FROM OTHER PROPOSALS OUT FOR- YES IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ARE DIFFICULT TO ASSESS WHAT THE CURRENT LACK OF ITS STRATEGIC PLANNING FOR HOW TO ENHANCE THE STATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY. FOR THESE PROPOSALS WE RECOMMEND PROVIDING THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING. THIS RECOMMENDATION WOULD APPLY TO THE SUPPORT CAPACITY AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT PROPOSALS IN THIS ITEM AS WELL AS OTHER ITEMS LATER IN THE AGENDA. UNDER THIS APPROACH THE LEGISLATURE WOULD PROVIDE THE REQUESTED FUNDING IN RECOGNITION THAT- YES MIGHT NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO FURTHER ENHANCE THESTATE'S EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPABILITIES. BUT THIS WOULD ALLOW THESE AUGMENTATIONS TO BE REVISITED AND THREE YEARS AFTER THE STRATEGIC PLAN AND REVIEW THE DEPARTMENT'S BASE BUDGET HAVE BEEN COMPLETED. REGARDING THE MISSION TASKING PROPOSAL IN THIS ITEM WE HAVE TO CONSIDER. FIRST THE PROPOSED SPENDING IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE FUNDING FLEXIBILITY BUT APPEARS TO HAVE A SIMILAR STORY INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET THROUGH THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT AM. WHICH ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE UPON NOTIFICATION TO THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE% ARGUMENT THE BUDGET OF THE DEPARTMENT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION INTENDS TO USE THIS FUNDING TO ADDRESS WHAT IT BELIEVES IS A GAP IN EXISTING EMERGENCY SPENDING AUTHORITIES. INCLUDING PROVIDING FUNDING IN CASES WHERE THE FUNDING UNDER THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY EIGHT AM THAT WE VIEW AS AN ALTERNATIVE MIGHT NOT BE AVAILABLE. WELL IT'S POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHEN THE NINETY EIGHT FORTY ITEM OR OTHER EXISTING FUNDING SOURCES ARE NOT A GOOD FIT. THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS PROBLEM EXISTS OR THE SIZE OF THE GAP IN OTHER EMERGENCY FUNDING AUTHORITIES THAT THIS PROPOSAL WOULD ADDRESS. SECOND THE PROPOSED FUNDING CIRCUMVENT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT BY NOT REQUIRING NOTIFICATION AT THE USE OF FUNDS. I WOULD ONLY REQUIRE A ONE TIME REPORT IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. ACCORDINGLY WE RECOMMEND REJECTING THIS PROPOSAL. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. I'M SURE WOULD YOU- LIKE GAP FROM THE FINANCE TO- THE COMMENTS BEFORE QUESTIONS ARE DIRECTED ENTERTAIN QUESTIONS FIRST. DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING TO ADD. I JUST A FEW THINGS I WAS JUST GOING TO ADD THAT WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THE GROWTH IN- YES IS BUDGET BUT DIFFICULT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WHILE MANY OF THOSE AUGMENTATIONS APPEAR TO BE KIND OF DUPLICATIVE IN NATURE GIVEN THE TYPES OF CLASSIFICATIONS THAT WERE ADDED- THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED TO. INTERPRET PRIOR YEARS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN VERY TARGETED IN TERMS OF THE TYPES OF- DIRECTORATES ARE AREAS WITHIN ONLY ADDS. BETTER BEING ENHANCED. SO FOR EXAMPLE LAST YEAR THERE ARE A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE FOR LOGISTICS OR OTHER TYPES OF DIRECTORATE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE. BUT THAT WAS REALLY TARGETED AT READING A STUDY STATE STREET OPERATIONS CENTER BASED STAFFING- BECAUSE- PREVIOUSLY THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER ALWAYS REDIRECTED FROM. HE ADDED DIRECTORATES TO SUPPORT ITSELF AND GIVEN THE ONGOING. AND FREQUENT USE OF THE STATE OPERATIONS CENTER. IS A RECOGNIZED NEED TO CREATE MORE BAY STAFFING THERE SO WELL THOSE APPEAR TO BE SIMILAR. RESOURCES BECAUSE OF THE TYPES OF CLASSIFICATIONS THAT THEY ADDRESSED. THE FOCUS AND PURPOSE IS VERY DIFFERENT THAN. ENHANCING JUST THE BASED STUDY STATE OF THE DEPARTMENT- SECONDLY JUST WANT TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE- MISSION TASKING PREPARATION. OBVERSES NINETY EIGHT HUNDRED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE FRAME NINETEEN HUNDRED IS MUCH BROADER THAN. REGENCY RESPONSE AND THAT IT IS CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT IS- SET UP TO MAINTAIN SOME. OF A PORTENT GUARDRAILS FOR UNANTICIPATED COSTS OUTSIDE EMERGENCY RESPONSE AND THAT TRYING TO ADAPT THAT MECHANISM TO. BE NIMBLE THAT WITH THE LEVEL THAT WORKS RESPONSE REQUIRES. WOULD COMPROMISE SOME OF THOSE- GUARD RAILS OR OTHER NON EMERGENCY RESPONSE RELATED UNANTICIPATED COSTS- WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A- PRIMARY CONCERN BEING RAISED IS TRANSPARENCY. AND SHARING OF INFORMATION THE LEGISLATURE AND WE'RE OPEN TO. ADDING BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE TO OUR REQUEST THAT WOULD REQUIRE. NOTIFICATION WITHIN TEN DAYS- OF ANY APPROVALS BEING MADE TO THE- WEBSITE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND THE AND THE CHAIRS OF THE- BUDGET COMMITTEES ARE SIMILAR TO OTHER. EMERGENCY RESPONSE. AUTHORIZATIONS THAT EXIST NOW- TO HELP WITH THAT TRADE. AND OVERSIGHT ROLE SO WITH THAT- HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTION. THANK YOU- I WOULD START WITH THE QUESTION FOR- OH YES- I HAVE SEEN JUST EVEN WHILE PRICES FOR IT THERE WERE. OUR FIRE SEASON SEEMS TO BE AROUND HIM ANYMORE EMERGENCY IS AND SO I DO UNDERSTAND- IMPART WIFE THE BUDGET HAS GROWN EXPONENTIALLY- WITH WITH THE VARIOUS EMERGENCIES THAT WE ARE CONFRONTED WITH- AND THAT'S JUST THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE. BUT GIVEN THE REALITY GIVEN THAT WE ARE OFTEN BEING HEARD SAYING THINGS LIKE OUR FIRE SEASON IS YEAR ROUND NOW- YOU KNOW KIM KENDALL YES RESPONSE TO THE ALLEY ELLIS RECOMMENDATION FOR AN OVER. ARCHING STRATEGIC PLANNING- YOU KNOW SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE COULD DO OUR JOB A LITTLE BIT BETTER AS WE TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THE OVERSIGHT. IT'S DIFFICULT WHEN WE HAVE ALL THIS GROWTH. EXPENDITURE THIS DIRECTOR GUARDED SHE- DO APPRECIATE THE L. A. O. EGG EGG KNOWLEDGE IN FIRST FALL THAT THE CHALLENGES I DO APPRECIATE YOUR KNOWLEDGE IN THE CHALLENGES- WILDFIRE SEASON IS YEAR ROUND BUT I THINK IT'S NOT JUST THE FACT THAT IT'S WHILE PARTICIPATING YEAR ROUND. IT'S THAT IT'S THAT THE SCOPE AND SCALE COMPLEXITY OF THE DISASTERS THAT WE'RE SEEING UP AND HOW MUCH THEY'RE IMPACTING THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE THE REQUIREMENTS TO RESPOND ARE MUCH FASTER MUCH MORE IN IN INCOME- INTENSIVE- AND- YOU KNOW OP WE'VE TOLD LA- THAT WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO SIT WITH THEM TO HELP TO- SHE CHECK- WHY AM I JUST WILL TELL YOU- WE WERE UNDER RESOURCE GOING INTO THIS THE LAST FEW YEARS HAVE BEEN UNPRECEDENTED WE DON'T SEE ANY IF IT'S SLOWING DOWN. IT'S BEEN A LOT OF OUR TIME- BUILDING PLANS- BUT WE HAVE TO BE RESPONDING TO THESE EVENTS- THE L. A- MENTIONED NOT GETTING A PARTICULAR- REPORT- IT WITH THAT YOU KOW I WAS IN CALIFORNIA OF COURSE WERE PRETTY BUSY AND DIDN'T DIDN'T GET TO WHERE- SO THE REALITY IS THAT- WE WILL WORK WITH THE L. A. HOPE TO BE ABLE TO. DO UP WITH THE GAP OR SOMETHING THAT WOULD HELP YOU- PROVIDE WHATEVER OVERSIGHT YOU YOU WOULD YOU THINK YOU NEED FOR US THAT WOULD BE A PARTNERSHIP WE WOULD LIKE WITH YOU ABOUT ALSO PLEASE IF YOU WOULD JUST IT DOES MEET THIS ONE UP POINT AND THAT IS THAT IS YOU KNOW. IN THIS I MEAN JUST. IN GENERAL. OF THE HIGHER PEOPLE AND TIMELY. TO IN. YOU KNOW JUST DIDN'T. ACROSS THE LAND IS CHAO- THIS THIS PARTICULAR INDUSTRY. ARE YOU ABLE TO GET. OF PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE WILLING TO COMMIT THAT KIND OF. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN THREE SIXTY FIVE- REQUIREMENTS- COMMITTEE FAMILY COMMIT THEIR TIME I MET UP THE EXTENT CATCH UP IN THIS THAT'S REQUIRED. THE PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE- BUT- WHEN WE LIMIT THEM WE SAY THAT LET'S SAY THIS IS A THREE YEAR- THERE'S NO. GUARANTEE AND WHAT ABOUT THE LONG TERM RIGHT TO BE- BETTER BETTER. CHALLENGE OF GETTING PEOPLE TO SIGN ON WITH US- IT IS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT- SO- I GUESS THE SHORT ANSWER IS WE WERE HAPPY TO WORK WITH ELIO AND WITH YOU ON THE PLAN- BUT ALSO- I JUST SORT OF APPEAL TO THE- TO YOU THAT THAT THE UNDERSTAND THAT- YOU KNOW. AS THEY GET WHERE WE NEED TO GET TO A WERE ALREADY UNDER. THE CURVE AND OF THESE DISASTERS ARE NOT SLOWING DOWN AND- WE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW. YOU ALL AND LARA LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHERE THE FIRST PLACE THAT. THE PHONE RINGS WHEN THERE'S EVENTS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN AND RESPONSE THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. AND WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO SERVE YOU AND SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AT. THE BEST OF OUR ABILITY. SO THINK WE HAVE A LOT OF COMMON GROUND WE- THE SISTERS DEFINITELY NOT DOWN AND MUCH MARK- AND INTO- IN ANY VENUE DID TO BILLS HAVE FUNDING GUARANTEE FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS SO THAT YOU CAN MAINTAIN AND- RETAIN STAFF I THINK THOSE ARE ALL THINGS THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND. BEING ABLE TO HAVE A REACHES A PLAN ALLOWS OVERSEE TO BE EASIER WHICH GIVES US MORE CONFIDENCE IN THESE DOLLARS THAT WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD I DON'T THINK. ARE CONCERNED ESTIMATE AT THIS POINT- THAT YOU NEED TO CONVINCE US THAT WE NEED MORE FUNDING FOR LIVING THE STAFF THERE'S OUR PHONES ARE BLOWING UP ON A REGULAR BASIS- MORE MORE OFTEN AND SO WE UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR. INCREASED FUNDING AND SO FORTH WE JUST WANT TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE WHEN OUR TAXPAYERS ARE VOTERS ASK QUESTIONS THAT THEY ARE CLEAR IT'S CLEAR TO THEM THAT WE ARE PUTTING IN THE PROPER OVERSIGHT AND WE COULD. WITH PRIDESAY THIS IS WHAT WE'RE DOING AND IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S ME THE JOB THAT WE NEED MEN SO I THINK THAT THOSE PLANS ALLOW US TO HAVE. A BETTER RELATIONSHIP- S. AS THE SITUATION CONTINUES TO CHANGE FOR LOTTERY SITTING INCLUDING CLIMATE CHANGE OUT THERE. AND SO I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE ALEJO TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT I THINK. JUST MAKES IT EASIER TO ANSWER QUESTIONS- OUT THERE I'VE BEEN TO SOME IS OPERATIONS THEY ARE INTENSE THERE ARE FAST MOVING- AND- YOU AND I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORT OF THE TEAMS OUT THERE- AND THEN WE'RE SEEING THAT MORE AND MORE. UP OUT THERE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR AND SO I DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT WE JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE WHEN WE TALKED INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ARE DOING OUR JOB OF OVERSIGHT AND THAT'S WHAT THESE PLANS ALLOW US TO DO THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE FROM. OKAY I HAVE A QUESTION AS I HAVE YOU HERE AND I APOLOGIZE I'M GOING TO GO OFF THE EDGE AND THAT'S JUST A LITTLE BIT AT THE TOPIC THAT I BROUGHT UP I THINK IN THE LAST THREE OF THE PREVIOUS HEARING BUT- UNDER. UNDER R. O. O. E. S. WE HAVE VICTIM SERVICES AS WELL AND WE HAD PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED THE CONSULTATION OF THIS INTO A NEW AN ENTITY AND I KNOW WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH A LOT OF DIFFERENT EMERGENCIES AND WE'RE TALKING TO THE ABOUT HOW YOUR DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE GROWING EXPONENTIALLY OUT THERE THAT WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOESN'T GET LOST IN THE PROCESS OF BOTH EQUALLY IMPORTANT OUT THERE ARE WE GETTING ANY CLOSER TO HAVING- YES A MINUTE TRANSITION PLAN ON. ON THIS ISSUE ON ON CONSOLIDATING OF VICTIM SERVICES AND GRANTS INTO A NEW ENTITY. OF ROGER I THINK THAT THE- I DO YOU SPEAKING ABOUT CONSOLIDATING WITH- THE VICTIMS. VICTIMS PROPOSITIONS TRANSPORTATION BOARD THAT'S PART OF IT YEAH BUT THAT'S THAT'S PART OF THE BIGGER THINGS I THINK IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. IN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THERE WAS A COMMITMENT TO CONSOLIDATE VARIOUS PIECES TOGETHER FOR SERVICES. OUT THERE AND I'M JUST WORRIED THAT US WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH ALL THESE EMERGENCIES THAT THIS IS GETTING LOST AND SO IT'S OKAY YOU DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER FOR ME TO DAVID JUST WANTED TO EMPHASIZE THAT I HOPE WE CAN FIGURE OUT- HOW YOU. DEAL WITH THE INTENSE EMERGENCIES AND MORE OFTEN THAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH BUT THAT WE DON'T LOSE TRACK OF A PIECES LIKE OUR VICTIM SERVICES IN THE CONSOLIDATION THAT WE HAD. AGREED TO IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN AND A PLAN THAT WE'VE BEEN WAITING FOR. YES THANK YOU FOR THAT- YEAH I WOULD JUST TELL YOU THAT- IT GIVES ANOTHER. EXAMPLE OF THAT THAT UNIQUENESS IS ABOUT WE ASK FOR WE'VE GOT. YOU KNOW I SORT OF USE THIS ANALOGY BEFORE IT- YES IS MUCH LIKE OUT A CITY GOVERNMENT WE HAVE OUR OWN FIRE AND RESCUE DEPARTMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WE'VE GOT OUR OWN. A PUBLIC WORKS THAT WE HAVE OUR OWN YOU KNOW GRANTS MANAGEMENT DIVISION. THROUGHOUT THE- THE EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS WE WORK TO KEEP. OUR BRANCH MANAGEMENT AND SOME OF THOSE OTHER OPERATIONAL- ASPECTS IT TAX SO THAT THEY CONTINUE TO DELIVER THE SERVICES. MOST OF THOSE ARE DRIVEN BY METRICS THAT ARE. ALL REQUIRED TO MEET- AND CONTINUE TO MEET THOSE DEADLINES THAT ARE SET FORTH BY. EITHER STATE OR FEDERAL GRANT REQUIREMENTS- AS WELL AS WORKING WITH THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE TO ENSURE THAT FOR EXAMPLE A RECIPIENT A COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATION. THAT IS A RECIPIENT OF THE GRANT I CONTINUE TO HOW ABOUT FUNDING FLOWING- SO THAT THEY CAN CONTINUE TO DELIVER THE SERVICES THAT. ARE SO CRITICAL IN THE FIELD- AND- WE HAVE. WE'RE EXACTLY- VICTIMS COP. BOARD WE'VE WE'VE- OF COURSE IT DON'T NOW WITH A LOOK COME. AND WE LOOK AT THAT THAT TOTALITY THE EFFECT INTO TALIBAN CONTINUE TO WORK AT IT- BUT THE- BUT THERE THERE'S BEEN YOU KNOW GIVEN THE COLD IT AND ALL THE OTHER. I'M OR DID SHE WE KEPT THE OPERATIONS GOING BUT ON THIS PARTICULAR TOPIC- YEAH I DON'T I HAVE TO GO BACK AND CHECK TO SEE EXACTLY WHERE WE'RE AT BUT- DON'T HAVE UP. A FINAL ON THAT TODAY. THAT'S APPRECIATE IT AS IF WE CANNOT SOMETHING COME BACK TO US WITH WHERE WE'RE AT WITH THE CONSOLIDATION PLAN- AND HOW WE COULD BE OF ASSISTANCE. TO YOU ON ON THAT ITEM I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS YOU CONTINUE TO GROW YOUR MENDOCINE. OF THE VARIOUS EMERGENCIES OUT THERE- THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT DOES WORK FOR VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS AND THAT WE ARE DELIVERING ON PROMISES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MADE OUT THERE AND SO. I DO APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS I HAVE A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN YOUR ABILITY TO GET THIS DONE AS YOU MANAGE. VARIOUS EMERGENCY SHELTER AND SO WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THAT. BOETTICHER THANK YOU WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SIX WHICH IS IMPLEMENTING NINE EIGHT EIGHT BEHAVIORAL AND MENTAL HEALTH HELPLINE. YES THEY ARE SO- IN THIS CASE THE BUDGET PROPOSES SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND TO IMPLEMENT A NEW FEDERALLY MANDATED NINE EIGHT EIGHT SUICIDE HOTLINE CALL SYSTEM. TO INCREASE THE EASE AND ACCESSIBILITY TO PROVIDE HELP TO THOSE CONSIDERING SUICIDE OR SELF HARM. BORDER NOTE THAT THE FCC MANDATED THAT TELECOMMUNICATION CARRIERS TO IMPLEMENT THIS NEW NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM BY JULY SIXTEENTH. TWENTY TWENTY TWO. HELLO YES IS ROLE AS THE OPERATOR OF THAT STATE NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM IS PROVIDING THE TECHNICAL SUPPORT CAPABILITY AND EXPERTISE TO STAND UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THESE NINE EIGHT EIGHT CALLS. BOB THOSE WHO DIAL IN THE NINETY EIGHT WILL BE DIRECTED TO ONE OF THE EXISTING THIRTEEN LIFELINE CALL CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE. THE CENTERS ALREADY PROVIDE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE WITH MENTAL DISTRESS UP WITH THOSE MENTAL DISTRESS AND THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING WILL ENSURE WITH THE APPROPRIATE TECHNICAL ENHANCEMENTS TO BE MADE- THAT ARE REQUIRED AND ENSURE THAT THOSE NEEDING SERVICES RECEIVED. HELP MORE EFFICIENTLY THIS IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT THE CONNECTION BETWEEN US PEOPLE CALLING NINE ONE ONE CONNECT OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. MY SERVER SO- IT'S LIKE IT'S UP YEAH IT'S REALLY THE ORTEZ FUNDING IS REALLY FOR- THE- WE ESTEEM TO ENSURE THAT THAT TECHNOLOGY IN THE CONNECTIVITY. IS THAT EFFICIENT MANNER. MADAM CHAIR AT JESSICA PETERS AT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE I'VE I'VE HEARD FROM THE HEARING ROOM THAT MY VIDEOS NOT COMING THROUGH SO FORGIVE THE- LACK OF A VISUAL PRESENCE HERE- I FIND THIS PARTICULAR ITEM- NEED WE DON'T HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE PROPOSAL AND THE PROPOSED AND- ACTIVITIES THAT- YES WE DO- WITHIN NINE EIGHT EIGHT. THE STAND OUTS WITH MENTIONED THIS IS THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS- AND WHILE- YESS MOST OF THE WAY TOWARDS MEETING THAT REQUIREMENT AND- PROVIDING THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING WOULD ALLOW FOR THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE NINETY AND NINE ONE ONE SYSTEMS. AS WELL AS TEXT CAPABILITY AND OTHER THINGS THAT I'M SEEM QUITE REASONABLE AND YOU KNOW HOW EVERYTHING IS THAT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT- PROVIDED FEDERAL FUNDING TO MEET FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT YET REPORTED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH- FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN RECEIVED OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THERE MIGHT BE SOME FEDERAL FUNDING THAT HAS COME THROUGH. BUT IT'S UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT- THOSE DOLLARS ARE INCLUDED OR ACCOUNTED FOR IN THIS PROPOSAL AS THIS IS GENERAL FUND AND NOT FEDERAL FUNDS. AND HOW THOSE FRIENDS HOW MUCH THE STATE RECEIVED AND HOW THOSE FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED AND WHETHER ANY OF IT COULD OFFSET. ON THE PROPOSED GENERAL FUND DOLLARS HERE. MEETING AT FOR ANY QUESTIONS. SYMCOR. VENTURA FINANCED NOTHING MORE TO ADD BY WAY OF PRESENTATION BUT HAPPY TO HELP ANSWER QUESTIONS. TELL US THANK YOU TO THE O. E. S. IN A- I APPRECIATE YOUR ROLE RIGHT NOW AND FACILITATING THEIR FEE STRUCTURE OF THE THIS HOTLINE. WHAT ONCE IT'S COMPLETED IS THERE A ROLE FOR- YES STILL THERE MOVING FORWARD OR- IS THIS THIS IS JUST. A ONE AND DONE TYPE EFFECT IDEAL FOR THIS FOR THE- S. PACIFIC TO THE NINE EIGHT EIGHT NINE. YES MEASUREMENT I HAVE OF MY DEPUTY DIRECTOR MITCH MEDIC WHICH OVERSEES THE NIGHT WENT SYSTEM KINDA ANSWERED THANK THE SPECIFICS ON THAT **** YEAH THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- YES THERE IS GOING TO BE AN ONGOING MISSION THAT WOULD TAKE PLACE THERE- OBVIOUSLY WITH THE THIRTEEN SITES IN A MONTH. TECHNOLOGIES IN PLACE AND WORKING WITH THE CARRIER'S- AS THE DOCTOR SHE SAID ENSURING THAT STANDARDIZATION OF EQUIPMENT- BUILD OUT TRAINING. BOB IT'S SUPPORTING THOSE LOCAL. THIRTEEN LOCAL SITES ALONG WITH THE INTEGRATION TO THE- EXISTING FOREIGN FORTY PUBLIC SAFETY ANSWERING POINTS AT THE SHERATON POLICE AND- FIRE DEPARTMENTS- RUN UP AND DOWN THE STATE SO. THAT WILL CONTINUE- AND THERE IS AN ONGOING- BUDGETARY REQUEST- THIS FOR TWENTY THREE POINT FOUR FOUR A FIVE POINT SEVEN. OR FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION. AND SO IT. IT JUST IT DO YOU EXPECT THAT TO BE THEN- A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION IN THE FUTURE I KNOW THAT IT'S JUST. YOU KNOW- LIMITED IN CURRENTLY BUT THE EXPECT THAT TO BE TURNED INTO A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. BUT WE EXPECT THE CONTINUATION THAT THE FUND- PERSONNEL THE TEN PERSONNEL- FOR THAT INTEGRATION OVERSIGHT- AS AS IT ACCORDINGLY THERE. AND THEN THEY'LL BE LIFE CYCLE REPLACEMENT COST FOR EQUIPMENT- SIMILAR TO ALL TECHNOLOGY PROJECTS WHERE. I'M EVERY SO MANY YEARS- OF EVERYTHING HAS TO BE UPDATED. K. THANK YOU COLLEAGUES MR STONE AND MR LIKE IN NEXT. SO IT'S A PRETTY IT THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IN NINE EIGHT SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM THAT I HAVE IS I'M STILL TRYING TO FIGURE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION'S TEN POINT WHAT'S THE PLAN FOR A RESPONSE. SO SOMEBODY CALLS NINE EIGHT EIGHT. THEN WHAT N. AND IF THEY'RE GONNA CALL AND THERE'S NOT A PLACE. FOR THAT CALL TO BE REFERRED CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE COUNTIES AND THERE'S NOT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. NOBODY'S GONNA CALL MY EIGHTY IN IN. FOR VERY QUICKLY GOING TO LEARN THAT THAT'S NOT. A PATH THAT WILL BE PRODUCTIVE THAN THOSE QUICKLY CALL NINE ONE ONE THE POINT IS TO TAKE. IS TO HAVE AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE RATHER JUST LAW ENFORCEMENT THIS IS A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS BUT ALSO TAKE SOME OF THE BURDEN OFF LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO IF WE SET UP THIS NICE SYSTEM BUT IT'S NOT CONNECTING ANYONE ANYWHERE. THEN WHAT. I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY- MITCH MEDIC IS A CHICKEN THE SO NINE EIGHT EIGHT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED SOMEWHERE NINE ONE ONE BY THE CARRIERS IN JULY. AND WE HAVE THIRTEEN EXISTING SITES THAT ARE LOCALLY RUN OF THOSE CALLS WILL THEN AUTOMATICALLY ROUTE TO THOSE SITES. WHERE YOU GET INTO THE CHALLENGES AND AS AS IT IS EXPRESSED BEFORE IS THAT. IF A CALL IS GOING TO A NINE ONE ONE CENTER THE NEEDS TO GO TO A NINE EIGHT EIGHT OR VICE VERSA AS THE SITUATION CHANGES- YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE A LOSS OF INFORMATION OR PUT PEOPLE IN THE BACK OF THE QUEUE EITHER WAITING. OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND YOU WANT THE EQUIPMENT STANDARDIZED AMONG THE THIRTEEN SITES AND YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CALL IS ROUTED. APPROPRIATELY AND GETS TO THE COST CENTER AND IT'S GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE NINE ONE SITES- THAT'LL TAKE PLACE SO THE CALL WILL BE ANSWERED- NOW BUT IT'S JUST WHEN YOU START THESE COMPLEXITIES AND THE CHALLENGES OF EMERGING MANAGEMENT WORKING WITH. THE VARIOUS- ENTITIES YOU CAN YOU CAN NOT WITHOUT A GOOD STANDARDIZED PROGRAM. THAT IS IN PLACE AND FUNDED AND SUPPORTED YOU CAN HAVE THE ABSENT THAT'LL EXIST AND WE JUST WANT TO RISK ANY. OF PUBLIC SAFETY- HEALTHCARE AND OF COURSE OBVIOUSLY ALL OF THIS HAS TO BE WORKING COORDINATION WITH CHS- BECAUSE- WE ARE NOT- TAKING A ROLE IN THE BEHAVIORAL SPECIALIST SIDE- BUT WE ARE- SUITED AND CAPABLE. OF ASSISTING IN THIS TECHNOLOGICAL- ENDEAVOR TO ENSURE THAT STANDARDIZATION AND IMPLEMENTATION WORKS PROPERLY RIGHT BUT ONE OF THE TOUGHEST CONNECT THAT THAT I HAVE HERE IS THAT YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR. THE TECHNICAL SIDE OF THE SYSTEM TO MAKE SURE THERE'S NOT A FUSION WITH NINE ONE ONE. THAT THE TWO SYSTEMS INTERACT. THAT'S FINE BUT- FOR THE BEST. AND I KNOW IT'S BABY ANOTHER AGE BUT WE'RE I THINK WE'RE HEADED FOR POTENTIAL DISASTER HERE IF CALLS COME IN AND THEY GET MANAGED JUST FINE WITH ALL THE TECHNOLOGY. BUT THERE'S NO APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. THERE'S NO PLACE FOR THAT CALL ULTIMATELY BE ROUTED. THEN WE HAVE A VERY NICE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTION WITH NOTHING WITH WITHOUT AN APPROPRIATE RESPONSE. TO THE CRISIS THAT. GENERATE THE CALL THE FIRST PLACE. YEAH THIS MARK- BAKER- AS WE UNDERSTAND IT WHICH I REMEMBER- SO I HELP HIM TO SERVICES WORKING ON TRAINING AND PROTOCOLS THAT WERE THAT WILL BE PUT IN PLACE TO ADDRESS JUST WHAT YOUR YOUR- YOUR RACING HERE AND HOW- THE UP THE- CALLS WILL BE ROUTED WHAT. THE RESPONSIBILITIES WILL BE WHETHER IT'S AND I WILL ONCE CENTER OR AT NIGHT AT CHATTER- THE METRICS THAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR IS TO ENSURE THAT YOU DON'T KNOW CALL IS LOST- THAT IS ANSWERED IN A TIMELY WAY- AND THAT THEM AND THAT THEY ARE. YOU KNOW THEY DON'T MEET THE REQUIREMENTS- I DON'T WANNA GO TOO FAR OUT OF MY LATEST IN BEING ABLE TO TELL YOU EXACTLY HOW TO DO IT BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT. UP THERE WHERE BUT I THINK THAT YOUR POINT- INSURANCE OF BOB THE TECHNOLOGY AND BE OUT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THE TECHNOLOGY WHEN THE CALL. IS ROUTED- ALL THAT ALL COMES IN THE IN THE PLAY IT'S OF GREAT CONCERN DOUBT- SOMETHING. THAT YOU KNOW- I HEAR YOU AND WE'LL- LOOK BACK WITH OUR H. JUST. BROKE BABIES ELSE WE COULD. COLLECTIVELY PROVIDE- RICHARD. MISTER LUCKY. YEAH THANK YOU- THERE THERE'S JUST SOME AMBIGUITIES THAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IF YOU COULD CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT FOR ME- FIRST OF ALL AS THE L. A- INDICATED THERE'S BEEN SOME SOME FEDERAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN ALLOCATED CAN YOU TELL ME ABOUT HOW MUCH AND WHAT WAS DONE WITH THAT. FUNDING. WHAT WE DO KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME FEDERAL GRANT- I FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UP FINDINGS THAT WERE PROVIDED TO THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM- THOSE THOSE PLANS HAVE BEEN COMMITTED BY HHS AT THIS POINT- AND- DIFFERENT. WAS NO FUNDING THAT WAS PROVIDED OH YES- TO DO WITH THAT TECHNOLOGY PIECE OF IT- AND THAT WAY TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM- SO WHERE YOU KNOW. I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHERE AGENTS IS THAT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION PHASE AT THIS POINT- AND WE ARE HOPING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- THE- THAT THE CURRENT ACTIVE WORKING ON. WILL AMPLIFY ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS THAT THEY SET FORTH IN THIS PROGRAM. SO- I MEAN I DON'T EVEN KNOW I DON'T EVEN KNOW EXACTLY HOW MUCH FUNDING- BURKE WAS ACTUALLY GIVEN THE HHS ON THIS TOPIC. OKAY WELL JULY IS NEARBY. AND- IT SEEMS. STE THE STRIKE OF FRESH TO THOSE OF US WHO ARE OVER. THE THAT THERE HASN'T BEEN GREAT COORDINATION BETWEEN HHS AND YOU FOLKS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A GREAT COORDINATED EFFORT. IN ORDER FOR THIS TO BE A SUCCESSFUL UNDERTAKING SO I'M HOPING THAT- THINGS WILL. HAVE SOME KIND OF SYNTHESIS HERE PRETTY. PRETTY SOON OTHERWISE- WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE A LOT OF FRUSTRATION SO I HOPE THAT THIS- GETS A LITTLE MORE CLEAR. OKAY SO I JUST WANT TO REITERATE- I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR EXPECTATION THAT- YES IS GOING TO HAVE THE ANSWERS FOR WHAT HAPPENS ONCE YOU SET UP THE TECHNOLOGY AND ROUTE THE CALL TO THE CORRECT LOCATION I THINK OUR CONCERN IS. TO ENSURE THAT BOTH WHETHER IT'S THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OR- THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE HAVE THE PLANS ARE APPROPRIATE TO THAT. THE INDIVIDUAL WHO NEED SERVICES AT SOME PLACE TO GO OTHER WAYS THAT THE PHONE CALL AND A BRIDGE TO NOWHERE. AND SO YOU KNOW I JUST WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF WHOSE LANE THAT IS- AND- YES COULD DO EVERYTHING RIGHT SET UP THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE SURE CALLS pARE BEING ROUTED PROPERLY TO THE NINE ONE ONE WHEN YOU NEED TO VERSES NINE EIGHT EIGHT- BUT WHAT HAPPENS. AFTER THAT AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT BETWEEN NOW AND JULY WE HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ENSURE THAT WE SUCCEED. OUT THERE INCITING MARC MY QUESTION IS MORE OR MY COMMENT IS MORE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCING FOR THE ADMINISTRATION- OF- WHAT WE'RE DOING TO ENSURE THAT THATBRIDGE GOES SOMEWHERE. FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS WHEN THEY GET. WHEN THE TECHNOLOGY WORKS AND THEY GET ROUTE IT BUT THEY NEED TO BE ABOUT IT SOME PLACE I NEED TO BE SOMETHING ON THE BACK AND IT'S NOT CLEAR THAT WE HAVE THAT YET. AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE BY JULY. YOU BETTER FINANCED LIKE IT'S JUST FOR ONE MOMENT- WE I THINK YOU'RE- FULLY HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE HHS COUNTERPARTS. HAVE GOT THOSE PLANS IN PLACE WHAT WE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE WE CAN GET SOME INFORMATION. TO THE COMMITTEE TO HELP OUR- INCREASE THE CONFIDENCE IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLANNING IN THAT AREA. OKAY WE LIVE FAR FROM THAT ANTI APPRECIATE MISTER LUCKY SOME ASSISTANCE COMMON FUND IN THAT SENSE OF URGENCY. WE'RE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN WHICH IS OUR CALIFORNIA EARLY EARTHQUAKE WARNING SYSTEM. OKAY ROGER THANK YOU- IT KNOB THE PROPOSAL- FULLER ASK FOR SEVENTEEN POINT ONE MILLION- AND THREE POSITIONS TO SUPPORT THEIR CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING PROGRAM AS YOU KNOW OUR MAY KNOW THAT THIS IS THE STATE OF THE ART SEISMIC WARNING SYSTEM DESIGNED TO PROVIDE EARLY WARNING OF AN IMPENDING EARTHQUAKE- DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE STANDING. IN RELATION TO THE EPICENTER OF THE EARTHQUAKE. GET A FEW SECONDS UP TO NINETY SECONDS OF WARNING- THAT THE EARTHQUAKE IS ACTUALLY COMING YOUR WAY- THE SYSTEM IS A STATEWIDE SYSTEM AND HAS ALREADY BEEN- ESSENTIAL IT PROVIDING EARLY NOTIFICATIONS OP EARTHQUAKES ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS VERY SUCCESSFULLY- THE APPROVAL OF THIS PARTICULAR. PROPOSAL WOULD BE EACH YEAR A FEW THINGS NECESSARY TO CONTINUE THE OPERATION OF THE SYSTEM. OFFERS IT WOULD INCREASE THE SENSOR DENSITY ARE INTO THE- RURAL PARTS OF NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT THIS THE SENSOR ARRAY THE CENTERS ARE CRITICAL AND BEING ABLE TO. DETECT THE GROUND MOTION AND- ECCENTRICITY THAT THIS WOULD INCREASE THE CENTER DENSITY SECOND IT WOULD FIND- GRANTS TO COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS OUGHT TO PROVIDE EDUCATION TO THE SOCIALLY ISOLATED GROUPS. AND OTHER UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES ARE ON THE PROGRAM HOW TO UTILIZE IT- NO ABOUT IT TO HELP SAVE LIVES AND PROTECT PROPERTY ACCORDINGLY- AND THEN THE THIRD IS THAT IT WOULD SUPPORT- CONTINUED NECESSARY RESEARCH. A PARTICULAR AREA OF NEW PUBLIC ALERT METHODS SO THAT WE WITH THAT THE KEY HERE IS SPEED- THE FASTER WE CAN GET THE SIGNAL OUT- TO INDIVIDUALS- THE FASTER THAT THAT- THEY CAN REACT AND- EVERY REALLY THEY'LL THEY'LL TERM EVERY SECOND COUNTS DEFINITELY. OPPORTUNITIES HERE- AND IT'S NOT JUST FOR INDIVIDUALS IT'S REALLY FOR ALL OF OUR INDUSTRIES IT'S HOW FAST CAN WE SLOW OR STOP A TRAIN THAT THE- YOU KNOW THAT EARTHQUAKE IS COMING. OUT SO THAT THE TRADE DEFICIT HE RAIL YOU KNOW OUR HELP IN THE MEDICAL INDUSTRY- YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE DOING SOME VERY DELICATE SURGERY THEY MAY TAKE A BREAK- UNTIL THE EARTHQUAKE PASSES- ECCENTRICITY THERE'S OF MANY AREAS OF. SECTORS BENEFITED FROM A MEDICATION STAMP. AS WELL THE LIGHTS STEM- BUT BASS TRAP. OP ASK IS TO CONTINUE TO THE IS THIS AREA. MADAM CHAIR JUST COMPUTERS WITHOUT THE CITY OF ANALYST OFFICE AND THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE OF THE ONES THAT I NEEDED TO EARLIER. THAT WE THINK- IT'S HARD TO A FAST IN THE ABSENCE OF A STRATEGIC PLANNER FOR HOW THE STATE ENHANCES ITS EMERGENCY RESPONSE CAPACITY I'M THE GOVERNOR HERE IS PROPOSING TO MAKE PERMANENT- ROUGHLY THE SAME-LEVEL OF FUNDING THAT'S PROVIDED IN RECENT YEARS ON A ONE TIME BASIS. TO CONTINUE DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM- AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED WHILE THE SYSTEM IS POTENTIALLY PROMISING WITHOUT A STRATEGIC PLAN IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THE CURRENT APPROACH TO BUILDING OUT THE SYSTEM WOULD ALIGN IT WITH THE STATE'S OVERALL EMERGENCY RESPONSE SCHOOLS WHICH AS WE NOTED EARLIER HAVEN'T YET BEEN DEVELOPED. I'M NOT SO ACCORDINGLY WE WOULD RECOMMEND IF THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THIS PROPOSAL APPROVE IT- WITH THREE YEAR LIMITED TERM FUNDING SO THAT IT CAN BE REASSESSED IN THREE YEARS SO ONCE THE STRATEGIC PLAN AND REVIEW OF- YES THIS BE SPENT CHECK. HAVE BEEN COMPLETED- AND I WOULD JUST FURTHER NOTE THAT THAT APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS DONE IN THE PAST TO FIND THAT REALLY WEREN'T PERFECT EARLY WARNING SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN TO PROVIDE AB ONE TIME FUNDING- THAT SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO REVIEW THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM. AS WELL AS- YESS AFTERWARDS TO DEVELOP THE SYSTEMIC NOW LOOK FOR OTHER FUNDING SOURCES BEYOND JUST STATE FACTS. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THE BILL WITH PART FINANCE WE THAT THIS PROGRAM IS AT A POINT WHERE WE DO NEED ONGOING STABLE FUNDING AND THAT GIVEN THE GENERAL BENEFIT THIS IS TO. ALL SECTORS OF THE STATE THAT- ONGOING GENERAL FUND IS AN APPROPRIATE. SOURCE IN SUPPORTING THE SPACE PROGRAM AND THAT THERE I THINK IS THAT. DIRECTOR CALLING US- NO THERE IS A SPACE FOR KIND OF A MINIATURE ONE TIME TYPE OF FUNDING OR THE- VARIOUS SECTORS CAN STILL PARTICIPATE IN HELPING TO SUPPORT THE SYSTEM. SO WITH THAT I HAVE AVAILABLE TO HELP ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. AT THANK YOU- I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS ACTUALLY THE SYSTEM ON MY PHONE- APPROXIMATELY HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE THE ALERTS ON- FOR THE SYSTEM ALREADY. SO MANAGER DIRECTOR- FIRST I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE HERE TO DOWNLOAD THE MY SHAKE OUT. PLEASE ARE YOUR PHONE ONLY TAKES A MINUTE- I THINK WE WILL HAVE WELL OVER A MILLION SEVEN ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION USERS CURRENTLY- I'LL CONTINUE TO PUSH OUT A PUBLIC- EDUCATION ON ON THIS AND- THIS IS REALLY A FUND OF UP FOUNDATIONAL AND FUNDAMENTAL. ROLE OF GOVERNMENT IN BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ALERT AND WARNING- AND- IT IS CREATED YOU KNOW IS A CRITICAL FUNCTION OF THIS UP- THE STATE AND PARTICULARLY CUTTING EDGE TECHNOLOGY. OUR THAT- HAS BEEN BUILT OUT WE ARE- YOU KNOW. THAT YOU'RE A RESPECT ALEJO'S- YOU KNOW UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BUT- THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS THAT THIS HAS BEEN A VERY ROBUSTLY. IMPLEMENTED PROGRAM A WITH MANY PARTNERS AND ENTITIES WE ARE UP ROUGHLY 85% BUILT OUT ACROSS THE STATE IT HAS BEEN- ISSUING EARTHQUAKE- ALERTS OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS VERY SUCCESSFULLY- AND- AND IT CONTINUES TO GET BETTER. THIS IS A SYSTEM OBVIOUSLY OF THE MOST. ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY THAT REQUIRES AN ONGOING AND UPDATING OF THE SYSTEM ON- OVER A REGULAR ANNUAL BASIS- AND- GIVEN THE DIVERSITY AND COMPLEXITY OF CALIFORNIA IT'S DISCOGRAPHY- AND THE FAULT SYSTEMS THAT EXIST. ALTHOUGH THE JAPAN AND MEXICO EARTHQUAKE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS THAT THEY'VE HAD THEM FOR YEARS NOPE LOCATION OF THE WORLD HAS BEEN S. COMPLEXES CALIFORNIA WITH REGARDS TO HAVING TO ROLL OUT THIS AT THIS UC SYSTEM. SO I WOULD JUST- SAY THAT I UP- YOU KNOW WHAT. BURKE YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS A STRATEGIC PLAN ON THIS WE'VE GOT A BUSINESS PLAN IT'S BEEN SUBMITTED THE LEGISLATURE- WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE UP WE'VE THE LEGISLATURE EVERY YEAR ON THIS PROGRAM CONTINUES. TO CREATE THE OF THE LEGISLATURE ON THIS PRO GRAHAM- AT THE I JUST TO DIFFER DOWN. THAT THAT THE THAT THAT MOVIE FOR A WITH THIS. VERY CRITICAL- I'LL OR SYSTEM- ISN'T BASED ON ANY- STRATEGIC A SET OF OBJECTIVES. IT SET UP- VIæT BOB BODY THAT IS APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR AND MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE IT IS HELPLESS HI THIS PROGRAM FORWARD- AND REALLY OUT WE ARE NOW LEADING THE WORLD.

I WANNA WITH ALL OF YOU TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE HAVE MORE PEOPLE DOWNLOAD THAT APP SO THAT OUR INVESTMENT IS GETTING THEIR MONEY'S WORTH- OUT THERE MY SECOND QUESTION. IS BACK TO THE ALLEY WAS COMMENTS ABOUT PROCURING ADDITIONAL WAYS TO FUND THIS PROGRAM SO FAR IT'S ALL BEEN. GENERAL FUND- ARE THERE SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES THAT WOULD BENEFIT THE MOST FROM THE X. TECHNOLOGY AND ARE WE- IDENTIFYING THEM AND TARGETING THEM. WORKING WITH US THAT THEY HELP PAY FOR PART OF THIS THIS PROGRAM.

BOARD MEMBERS- THAT HAVE BEEN APPOINTED BY THE LEGISLATURE REPRESENTING THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE TRANSPORTATION. OP I UTILITIES- WORKS HELP MEDICAL RESERVE AREAS YOU HAVE SECTORS- AND OF COURSE EDUCATION SECTOR RIGHT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS- CAN DROP COVER AND HOLD WHEN- WHEN EARTHQUAKES COMING SO THEY CAN GET OUT OF THE GAS. METER AREAS WE'VE REALLY BEEN FOCUSING ON- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY THE INVESTMENTS MADE BY THE PRIVATE SECTOR BOB FOR EXAMPLE LET'S TAKE TRANSPORTATION YOU KNOW PART- ALLEY MTA- CALTRAIN HAVE ALL BEEN WORKING THE HIGH SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY. VESTED IN SENSORS ON THEIR TRACKS THEY'VE INVESTED IN THE ABILITY TO PUT OUR ALGORITHMS- THE PART ONCE THEY GET THE WITH A WARNING TO SLOW OR STOP TRAINS. BOB THEY HAVE DONE PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS- THEY'VE INSURED ALL OF THEIR FOLKS HAVE DOWNLOADED THE APPS WE WORK WITH- APPLE AND- GOOGLE ARE TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT IN THE CASE OF GOOGLE ANDROID PHONES. THE PHONES ARE NOW BEING PROVIDED WHEN YOU BUY A PHONE WITH THE CAPABILITY OF IMPLEMENTED PHONE AND WORKING WITH APPLE ABOUT IT THAT'S A BIG PUT IN. THEIR FAULT SOTHAT YOU DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO DOWNLOAD THE APP WORKING WITH THEM TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PHONES ARE. IT ESSENCE OF THE ACCELEROMETER IN YOUR PHONE HAS THE ABILITY WERE WE CAN CROWDSOURCE OF WINTER EARTHQUAKE IS HAPPENING AND WE CAN MAKE A DETERMINATION BASED UPON THAT CROWDSOURCING- ALL AS ANOTHER. AMPLIFIED- ALL ON OF THE- GREGORY SAID ON THE- BUT USING CROWDSOURCING TO AMPLIFY THE SICK. AND ALERT OF THEIR OR YOU JUST THE USE OF YOUR PHONE- BEATRIX OF THE OF IN THE IN THE MURDER SERVER. BOB EVEN VESTED- PUTTING THE SENSOR ARRAY SO THE WHEN B. THEY GET THAT WARNING. FIRE DOORS THAT THAT WERE THE FIERY GINGER LOCATED AUTOMATICALLY COME UP SO THAT IF THE EARTHQUAKE HAPPENS AND IT. IMPACTS THE FIREHOUSE THE DOORS THE PRICKLY HISTORICALLY IN PREVIOUS EARTHQUAKES I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO OPEN AND WE CANNOT GET THE FIRE RAGES OUT THE GO RESPOND TO THE EARTHQUAKE SO. SO BEFORE THE EARTHQUAKE EVEN ARRIVES. THE LIGHTS COME ON THE UP. THE DOORS ROLL UP AND THE FIREFIGHTERS OUR ARE ONE STEP CLOSER IN RESPONDING. TO THE ATTACK- JUST TO BE GET A HOLD OF DIRTY THAT THE IN HAS. IN KEEPING TO INVEST. AS WE WORK TEM IN THE- OF THE FOR. I WANNA CONGRATULATE YOUNG THOSE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE ENTHUSIASM YOU'RE BRINGING TO THIS. PROJECT BUT I DO JUST WANT TO GO BACK TO- WHEN WE PASSED THE INITIAL BILL. WE MADE A PROMISE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FIND ADDITIONAL WAYS TO FUND THIS PROGRAM THE ON THE GENERAL FUND SO WHETHER THAT'S FEDERAL.

SO EXACT THE EXAMPLE OF THE FIRE DOOR FIREHOUSE OPENING IS CLEARLY WELL OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT THROUGH THE DATA CASTING TECHNOLOGY IT CAN BE USED FOR YOUR LAST QUESTION PRIVATE SECTOR INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES LIKE IN YOUR DISTRICT MANAGER. THEY COULD GET A QUICK MORNING AND START TO DAMP DOWN THEIR PROCESSING EQUIPMENT SO THEY DON'T HAVE AN UPSET LIKE AT A REFINERY- THE WITH A MILLION DOLLARS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR ONE TIME FUNDING.
