RESPONSIBLE BUDGETING REQUIRES HONEST DELIBERATION OF ALL SIDES AND WE HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS TODAY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION. THE YOU MR VICE TURN OUT GOOD AND A- YOU MISTER. GOOD EVENING MEMBERS I AM PLEASED AND HONORED TO PRESENT TO YOU THIS YEAR'S SUB ONE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES BUDGET PLAN. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING BUT I WILL SAY IT ANYWAY. THIS IS BEEN A YEAR LIKE NO OTHER AND OUR BUDGET PLAN IS LIKE NO OTHER AS WELL. I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE RESOURCES IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AS THE PEN PANDEMIC HAS NOT HIT US ALL EQUALLY. WE WILL MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS AND MOST OF WHAT YOU SEE ON OUR PLANS ARE PRIORITIES THAT CHAMPIONS AND ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS ENSURE THAT ALL COMMUNITIES CAN MEET BASIC NEEDS FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN AND BE CARED FOR AND RECEIVE SUPPORTS WHEN THEY FACE TRAUMA INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY UNEMPLOYMENT DISEASE AND DISABILITY. THE DEPARTMENT OF DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES COMPLETED A BURNS RATE STUDY IN TWENTY NINETEEN TO ADDRESS THE SUSTAINABILITY QUALITY AND TRANSPARENCY OF COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. IT IDENTIFIED A SHOCKING ONE POINT FOUR BILLION IN MAJOR GAPS OF WHAT DDS PROVIDERS NEEDED VERSUS WHAT WE WERE FUNDED. I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE BUDGET BEFORE US. PROVIDE A PHASED IN APPROACH TO CLOSE THIS GAP BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. THIS WILL PROVIDE STABILITY FOR A SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN ROCKED IN COVE IT AND THAT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDERFUNDED. THIS ACTION MEANS THAT WE WILL FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE LANTERN MEN ACT. ON WHICH S MANY RELY TO LIVE FULL SAFE AND DIGNIFIED LIVES IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE MAKE CRITICAL CHANGES TO MINIMIZE THE CAL WORKS TO MODERNIZE THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM SO THAT I CAN PROVIDE REAL TRAUMA INFORMED SUPPORT TO PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN IN THE SAFETY NET PROGRAM. WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT NEUROSCIENCE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND IMPLICIT BIAS HAVE INFORMED US WITH WHAT WE CALL CAL WORKS TWO POINT OH AND THESE INVESTMENTS WILL HELP TO REALIZE THE TWO POINT NO TRANSFORMATION. THIS POWERFUL PROGRAM CAN BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY SO THAT THE PARENTS AND CHILDREN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. WE INVEST FURTHER INTO CAL WORKS FUNDING. CASE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AND RESTORES THE CUTS TO THE CAL WORKS HOME VISITING PROGRAM. THE IRONY OF LIVING ON THE BREAD BASKET OF THE WORLD IS THOSE WHO WORKED SO DILIGENTLY TO PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLES. TOO OFTEN FACE FOOD INSECURITY THEMSELVES. THE SOLUTION TO FIGHTING HUNGER AT RECORD LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA IS TO PROVIDE STRONG INVESTMENTS IN OUR EMERGENCY FOOD INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS BUDGET SUPPORTS FOOD FOR ALL WHICH EXPANDS ACCESS AND C. PAP TO END THE IMMIGRANT EXCLUSION IN THE STATE'S NUTRITION SAFETY NET. RAMPING UP TO GET THERE BY JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. IT ALSO PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO FUND THE NEEDS OF OUR INDISPENSABLE FOOD BANKS AND PROVIDES DISASTER RESILIENCY FOR THE FUTURE. WE GIVE OVER ONE BILLION TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS THAT ARE PART OF THE FRONT LINE ANTI POVERTY SAFETY NET WE PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL GRANT INCREASE FOR SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS AND WE FIND A MULTITUDE OF SUPPORT IN OUR CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. OTHER NOTABLE INVESTMENT IN OUR HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAMS INCLUDE EXPANDING ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES RESTORING THE SOCIAL RECREATION AND CAMPING SERVICES FOR PERSONS WITH. INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES BROADENING EARLY START SERVICES TWO THREE AND FIVE YEAR OLDS. AND INCREASING THE CAPACITY AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS. SIMILARLY THERE ARE MANY INVESTMENTS IN OUR HEALTH PROGRAMS TO BE EXCITED ABOUT IN THIS BUDGET. LED BY ADVOCATES AND MY COLLEAGUES THEY INCLUDE ESTABLISHING A STATEWIDE ELECTRONIC POLST REGISTRY. CREATING HEALTH PROFESSIONS CAREER OPPORTUNITIES PROGRAM PROVIDING WRAPAROUND SERVICES FOR PATIENTS WITH ALS CONTINUING THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PILOT PROGRAM FUNDING THE END THE EPIDEMICS PROPOSAL. ELIMINATING THE MEDIC CAL ACID TEST EXPANDING THE PARKINSON'S DISEASE REGISTRY PROGRAM. AND COVERING DOULA AND PROMOTE TAUGHT SERVICES MEDICAL. IT ALSO SUPPORTED THE ALL CHILDREN THRIVE THE STATEWIDE INITIATIVE THAT SUPPORTS EFFORTS TO MITIGATE THE DISPARATE EFFECTS OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THAT CALIFORNIA'S CHILDREN FACE. SIMILARLY IT PROVIDES SIXTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO SUSTAIN AND EXTEND THE INNOVATIVE AND IMPACTFUL CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTRA EXTRA ORDINARY WORK DONE BY THE ADMINISTRATION UNDER USED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROPOSAL. EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC MANY OF US RECOGNIZED THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS WOULD BE A TSUNAMI. THAT RESULTS FROM CORVIDS EARTHQUAKE. RADICALLY DATA BEARS THIS OUT SHOWING SIGNIFICANT RISING RATES OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ESPECIALLY AMONG KIDS. RISING TO THE MOMENT THE GOVERNOR INCLUDED A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR RESPONSE TO THIS CRISIS IN AS MANY REVISED AND I'M HONORED THAT IT'S PART OF OUR PLAN TO. OUR LAN MAKE STRIVES TO INCREASE RESILIENCY AND TO ADDRESS TRAUMA THAT CHILDREN HAVE FACED DURING THE PANDEMIC. I'M ALSO APPRECIATIVE OF THE GOVERNOR'S IN DOING THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIKAL CAL TEAM PROPOSAL AND THANK THE ADMINISTRATION FOR WORKING CLOSELY WITH MY COLLEAGUES. CAL AIM IS AN UNPRECEDENTED SWEEPING PACKAGE OF REFORMS TO STREAMLINE TRANSFORM AND FOUND DACIAN WE CHANGE MEDICAL SERVICE DELIVERY AND FINANCING. TALION WILL HELP TO IMPROVE SERVICE DELIVERY AND IN DOING SO REDUCE HEALTH DISPARITIES. I AM THRILLED THAT BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE HAVE ALREADY TAKEN ACTION TO SUPPORT HEALTH FOR ALL EXPANDING FULL SCOPE MEDICAL COVERAGE TO OUR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES AGED FIFTY AND OLDER. THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HIT FRONT LINE AND THE CENTRAL WORKERS ESPECIALLY HARD INCLUDING MILLIONS OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS TAKING ON A DISPROPORTIONATE RISK OF EXPOSURE. THE PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXACERBATED RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE IS NECESSARY FOR EVERY RESIDENT IN OUR STATE. IT IS CRITICAL THAT OUR STATE ACT NOW TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF ALL LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY WERE BORN. THE DEFICIENCIES IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM NATURALLY HIGHLIGHT THE DEFICIENCIES IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. IT HAS LONG BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH HEALTH INEQUITIES AND AN UNDER FUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ARE KEY FACTORS AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF CALIFORNIANS. AND IN THE INTEREST OF NOT LETTING A GOOD CRISIS GO TO WASTE OUR PLAN INCLUDES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. WE ARE PROVIDING A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO MEET. CORE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AN INVESTMENT THAT ISN'T ACCOMPANIED BY RESOURCES TO FUND AN ANALYSIS OF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH STAFFING AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. IN ORDER TO INFORM FUTURE FUNDING DECISIONS. THESE INVESTMENTS AND OUR EXPERIENCE RESPONDING TO THE PANDEMIC UNDENIABLY BEGS THE QUESTION. HAS CALIFORNIA'S PUBLIC HEALTH REALIGNMENT BEEN A FAILURE. WE CAN NO LONGER TURN A BLIND EYE AND BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A QUESTION THAT MUST BE ANSWERED AND A CONVERSATION THAT MUST BE HAD IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE. OUR PLAN ALSO MAKES AN UNPRECEDENTED A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLAR ANNUAL INVESTMENT. DIRECTLY INTO COMMUNITIES IN CBO'S VIA A HEALTH EQUITY FUND AS WELL AS A TRANSGENDER HEALTH EQUITY FUND. IN ORDER TO BEGIN TURNING THE TIDE ON SYSTEMIC RACISM AND ENTRENCHED HEALTH INEQUITIES IN OUR STATE. I SAW FIRST HAND THE IMPORTANCE THAT THESE NONPROFITS PLAYED IN BEING BOOTS ON THE GROUND AND TRUSTED MESSENGERS. AND HELPING TO EDUCATE AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF THE COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE. IT'S REQUIRED A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN STATE COUNTY AND CBO'S TO EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS THE COMPLEX ISSUES FACING OUR STATE. THE HEALTH INSURANCE INVESTMENTS IN OUR PLAN REFLECT NOT ONLY CARE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED TODAY BUT THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE ALL WANT FOR OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN A POST PANDEMIC FUTURE. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THESE IMPORTANT CONVERSATIONS ON THE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH ADDRESSING THE UNDERLYING ROOT CAUSES BETWEEN THE INEQUITIES THAT PERVADE OUR SYSTEMS AS PART OF MY ROLE AS CHAIR OF SUB ONE. AND AS THE ASSEMBLY SELECT COMMITTEE ON ENSURING SYSTEMIC EQUITY POSTPONED AT NINETEEN. BEFORE I END I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR AND HIS ADMINISTRATION.

INCREASING ACCESS TO- CHILD CARE PROGRAMS BY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDITIONAL SLOTS WAS THAT MEAN FOR PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WE CURRENTLY HAVE A WAITING LIST OF FOUR THOUSAND FAMILIES WILL TO BE CUT IN HALF BECAUSE OF THE INCREASED CHILD CARE SLOTS LED UNIVERSAL ACCESS TO TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR FOUR YEAR OLDS. MANY YEARS IN THE MAKING FOR THIS TO MAKING SURE THAT THAT MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND ALL FAMILIES OF FOUR YEAR OLDS WERE ABLE TO ATTEND A PUBLICLY FUNDED TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN WE ALSO INCREASE OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES FOR OUR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND PRE K. PROGRAMS. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR WORK PROFESSIONAL WORKERS I DON'T GET PAID POVERTY WAGES BUT CAN- TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES MANIAS WORKERS ACTUALLY QUALIFY FOR THE SAME PROGRAMS THAT THEY WORK IN BECAUSE OF THEIR LOW WAGES SO THIS WILL PROFESSIONALISE THE PROGRAMS WELL AS MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A NOT SO MUCH TURNOVER WE ALSO EXPAND ACCESS TO OUR- OUR OUR PRESCHOOL.

HIGHER EDUCATION BUT THEY HAVE A CHANCE TO GET MORE EDUCATION AFTER HIGH SCHOOL AND C. T. IS A WAY. TO GET A PIPELINE FOR- YOU KNOW THE JOBS OF THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY. BUT IT'S CALLED READING THIS IS A BIG PIECE OF THE PUZZLE TOO SO WE HAVE. SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION ONE TIME FOR A THREE G. COMPLETION GRANT PROGRAMS CREDIT RECOVERY AS WELL AS HELPING PAY FOR. AP EXAMS AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS LONG A PRIORITY THE LEGISLATURE. WE BUILD UPON WITH THE GOVERNOR- RECOMMENDS AND HAVE A BILLION DOLLARS TO EXPAND OUR OUR EXPANDED LEARNING PROGRAMS OTHERWISE ANOTHER ASUS PROGRAMS.

THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW SO WERE WHO WERE FIGHTING RECORD AMOUNTS OF SUPPORT TO EXPAND. ENROLLMENT AT OUR UC AND CSU CAMPUSES. I WOULD YOU SEE MORE FULLY FUNDING THE UC BUDGET REQUEST AND DOING MORE. WE'RE SUPPORTING AN ADDITIONAL SIX THOUSAND STUDENTS TO ENROLL IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. THE LARGEST EXPANSION EVER PUT FORWARD BY THE STATE LEGISLATURE- WE ALSO HEARD LOUD AND CLEAR THAT TOO MANY OF OUR UC CAMPUSES. ARE ELUSIVE FOR STUDENTS WHO HAVE AMAZING GRADES. AND AND ACADEMIC CREDENTIALS BUT CAN'T GET IN TO THE UC ESPECIALLY AT THE MARQUEE CAMPUSES OF UCLA SAN DIEGO AND BERKELEY. SO WE'RE GOING TO LOWER THE NUMBER OF NON RESIDENT STUDENTS.

WITH THE FULL FUNDING OF THE COLAB PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES FOR OTHER PROGRAMS LIKE FULL TIME FACULTY PART TIME FACULTY OFFICE HOURS. WE DO NOT FUNDS THE CALIBRATOR OF RAM- WHICH WE THINK IS A FAILED EXPERIMENTS THEIR ONLINE EDUCATION WE THINK OUR EXISTING COMMUNICABLE JUST CAN DO. THIS WORK MORE EFFICIENTLY- AND THEN LASTLY LAST BUT NOT LEAST. WE HAVE A REALLY EXCITING PROPOSAL WE'RE ASKING THE GOVERNOR TO EMBRACE. THAT MAKES COLLEGE- I DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA THAT SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING THAT- IS ELUSIVE. BUT WE THINK THAT BY INCREASING FINANCIAL AID TO OUR CAR CAL GRANT PROGRAMS. IN THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS ARE GETTING AMPLE FINANCIAL AID. IN ADDITION TO THEIR TO THEIR APPROPRIATE PARENT CONTRIBUTIONS AND THEN WORKING FIFTEEN HOURS- THE WEEK THROUGHOUT THE SCHOOL YEAR AND THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GRADUATE- DEBT FREE. SO THIS IS AN EFFORT TO REALLY MAKE COLLEGE MORE AFFORDABLE AND ACCESSIBLE SO STUDENTS AREN'T AREN'T SHOULDER WITH. SO MUCH DEBT THAT IMPACTS THEIR ABILITY TO- TO MOVE ON AFTER GRADUATION BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. IT PROVIDES ENOUGH GRADUATES. TO FILL- THE JOB THAT WE HERE OUR STATE TO THRIVE SO WITH.

BUT THE REALITY IS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS TRENDING HASHTAGS LIKE OSCARS SO WHITE HAVE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE LACK OF DIVERSITY IN EQUITY IN PRODUCTION. IF WE ARE INVESTING TAXPAYER DOLLARS.

OUR STAFF AND ALL OF US FOR ENGAGING WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS DURING THIS PROCESS. I'M JUST GONNA MAKE A COUPLE OF BRIEF COMMENTS ON TWO TOPICS HAVING TO DO WITH BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE NUMBER FOUR. UP FIRST WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS I AM VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. FINALLY BEGINS TO MAKE A HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO AN ONGOING INVESTMENT. IN HOMELESSNESS SOLUTIONS AND HOUSING. AND I'M PARTICULARLY PLEASED- TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE CRITICAL ACCOUNTABILITY ELEMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO OUR HOMELESSNESS EXPENDITURES AND PRIORITIES. THIS IS SOMETHING I'VE HEARD. CONSISTENTLY IN RECENT YEARS IN THE MIDST OF. THE MOST INTENSE HOMELESSNESS CRISIS INTERSTATES HISTORY THAT AS WE ARE. MOVING OUT HISTORIC INVESTMENTS- THAT WE DO IT WITH WITH KHIMETRICS- AND REAL ACCOUNTABILITY- I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE WILL BE- ELEMENTS OF HOW WE FUND A DATA DRIVEN SYSTEM IMPROVEMENT. LIKE REGIONAL AND STATEWIDE GAPS NEEDS ANALYSIS WHICH WILL HELP PROVIDE US WITH TOOLS TO SUPPORT LONG TERM PLANNING EFFORTS. AND TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHAT IT'S GONNA TAKE TO FUNCTIONALLY AND HOMELESSNESS. EIGHT THAT THERE ARE ALSO GONNA BE ELEMENTS OF HOW WE LEVERAGE EXISTING INVESTMENTS TO CREATE BETTER REGIONAL COORDINATION AND ALSO HOW DO WE CREATE REAL. ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT INCENTIVIZE REALISTIC GOAL SETTING AND CARROTS AND STICKS FOR LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO SPEND FUNDS WITHURGENCY AND WITH AN EVIDENCE BASED APPROACH. I ALSO WANT TO JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND APPRECIATE THE FOCUS IN THIS BUDGET ON THE ON GOING CHALLENGES AT EDT. I THINK FOR MANY OF US ON BUDGET SUB FOR WE'VE SPENT COUNTLESS HOURS PREPARING FOR AND PARTICIPATING IN OVERSIGHT HEARINGS. AND IT'S REFRESHING TO SEE SOME REAL SOLUTIONS AND MEANINGFUL FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET- AND THE FACT THAT- THE LEGISLATURE. IS ASKING- THE ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE EVEN MORE INVESTMENTS IN THIS AREA- I WANTED JUST PARTICULARLY CALL OUT THE FUNDING TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF LANGUAGE ACCESS. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SEVEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE. OF LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY HAVE CONTINUED SUPPORT DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. I THINK WE ALL AGREE THERE'S A LOT MORE TO BE DONE AND THAT THE PROPOSAL'S IN THIS BUDGET WON'T SOLVE EVERYTHING OVERNIGHT. BUT THESE ARE IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS AND I REALLY WANTED JUST AGAIN THANK OUR LEADERSHIP. AND THE ADMINISTRATION FOR THIS CONVERSATION WITH THAT- I WILL PASS BACK TO THE CHURCH. THE COMMISSION SHE WOULD GO TO GO TO MR MEDINA NEXT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR JUST A SHORT COMMENT TO COMMUNICATE HOW PLEASE I AM WITH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE BUDGET- IN PARTICULAR I AM THANKFUL TO THE BUDGET CHAIR.

KIM MISTER CHAIRMAN AND THANK YOU TO- SUB ONE CHAIR JOAQUIN ARAMBULA. AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THERE- I HAVE A SOME COMMENTS ON ON A- ON A BUDGET ITEM THAT CAME OUT IN THE MAY REVISION IT DEALS WITH LPS AND CONSERVANCIES- THAT STARTING ON JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY. N. PHASE IN THE RETURN OF ALL LPS- CONSERVANCIES- SEVEN SEVEN EIGHT INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY IN THE STATE HOSPITALS TO THE COUNTIES OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS. THIS IS A SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO PUT A BURDEN ON THE COUNTIES THAT WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT WITHIN THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT THAT WE'VE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR ON THESE ISSUES- CERTAINLY IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO. LOOK AT- INTO THE POPULATION THAT'S THERE IN UNDER THE PROPOSAL DOES EXIST TODAY COUNTIES WOULD BE EXPECTEDTO FIND LOCAL PLACEMENTS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS. OUT OF THE STATE- HOSPITALS INTO THE COUNTY THEN GIVING A BURDEN TO THE COUNTIES- TO FIND AN INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IN MANY TIMES DOES NOT EVEN EXIST. THERE IS GREATER PLANNING- WHEN COUNTIES WERE EXPECTED TO TRANSITION INTO THIS ROLE WITH OTHER- ITEMS OTHER ISSUES THAT CAME FORWARD. BUT NOW PUTTING ALL THIS BURDEN AT OUR CUNTY LEVELS TO EASE THE BURDEN THAT OUR STATE HOSPITALS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD. BE LOOKING AT AND ADVOCATING FOR ESPECIALLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHEN THIS INFRASTRUCTURE ISN'T THERE YOU'VE HEARD ME SPEAK ON THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT I WANT TO THANK- THE COMMITTEES IN THIS BUDGET FOR. ACKNOWLEDGING THE YOUTH IN THE MENTAL SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED BUT IF WE HAVE TO NOW START TO LOOK AT A INFRASTRUCTURE THAT MANY TIMES DOES NOT EVEN EXIST AND LET THE LOCAL LEVELS NOW. TAKE ON THAT BURDEN OF THOSE- INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE IN THE TATE HOSPITALS THEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE A BIG- DRAIN AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ON THOSE SERVICES THAT ARE THERE. AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE A MORE ADVOCACY TO BRING THAT TOPIC UP FOR A GREATER PLAN. WHEN THESE TYPES OF THINGS CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD TO THE LOCAL LEVEL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MISTER ROBERTS MR FRAZIER AND THE MYSTERY OF US. THANK YOU THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. YOU KNOW FIRST AND FOREMOST I NEED TO THANK. ALL MY SIBLINGS HERE MISTER RANDALL- AND ALSO OUR BUDGETARY MR TANG- FOR ABSOLUTELY EMBRACING. A COMPASSIONATE NEED FOR FUNDING FOR THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION THE IDT OF POPULATION THREE DDS. I'VE BEEN A BROKEN RECORD FOR MANY YEARS AND- AFTER THE RATE STUDY HAD. HIT THE STREETS AND WE HAVE BEEN ACKNOWLEDGING THAT WE HAD BEEN DEFICIENT FOR SO MANY YEARS. OF THIS FUNDING FOR THIS POPULATION OF QUALITY OF LIFE AND ADVANCING THEIR ABILITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL. THAT THE POLITICAL WILL HAD TURNED INTO. A OPPORTUNITY FOR THIS POPULATION. THE ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IS PHASED IN OVER FOUR YEARS WITH A FEDERAL MATCH SO IT'S NOT JUST A HIT ON THE GENERAL FUND. BUT I WILL LIKE TO SAY I LOVE THE ABILITY FOR. A BEING PHASED IN BECAUSE AS MY COLLEAGUE. OF OVER THERE AS STATED. THAT THE SAN MANUEL TRIBE- THAT IT WAS. ABOUT A PHASE IN ABOUT AN ABILITY TO DO SO AND EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT PREPARED FOR THAT INFLUX OF MONEY THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE TO SPEND IT ALL IN ONE YEAR THEY CAN ROLL OVER TO THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR TO AUGMENT THAT THAT. THAT YEAR. ON ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS IS THAT- WITH THE DESPERATE NEED FOR EARLY INTERVENTION EARLY START. SOCIAL WRECKING CAMP. ALL OF THE THINGS THAT HAVEN'T BEEN DEPLETED. IN THE STATE HAS BEEN AFFECT FITTED FROM THE DECIMATION OF THE DEVELOPMENTAL CENTERS OVER THE YEARS. THERE WAS NO RECIPROCATION TO THE POPULATION. AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT KNOWING THAT. THE SPECIAL NEEDS POPULATION WE ARE. THE LEGISLATURE THEIR CARE CARETAKERS FIRST AND FOREMOST TO COME FROM HERE HOW WE FUND THE ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE TAKEN CARE OF ALL ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY MEMBERS ARE RESPONSIBLE. FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY AND I CAN'T THANK THIS BODY ENOUGH FOR RECOGNIZING THAT THIS POPULATION HAS BEEN. IN DESPERATE NEED AND NOW. WE CAN BE PROUD TO SAY WE STEPPED UP. AND WE DID OUR JOB. MISTER CHANG THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR HELP THANK YOU MISTER O'DONNELL YOU HAD A. TWENTY SO. SO SOME OF THE DATA SECOND THANK YOU OF. WE'RE GONNA BEFORE WE GO TO- MISS REVERSE I BELIEVE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DID WANT TO MAKE A BRIEF STATEMENT SO LET ME START THIS MAKE THAT STATEMENT. AND THE QUESTION MAKE IT. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M GOOD AFTERNOON CAROTENE VICE CHAIR FONG AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ANY JARVIS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THANKS FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE ASSEMBLY'S BUDGET PLAN I WILL BE BRIEF. AND THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER WITH THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY TO COME TO A FINAL BUDGET AGREEMENT IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS. THAT IS STRUCTURALLY BALANCED MAINTAINS BUDGET RESILIENCE AND MOST IMPORTANTLY INVESTMENT AND MEETS THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS ESPECIALLY THOSE HOUSEHOLDS MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. LIKE THE MERRY VISION THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN PROJECTS REVENUE GROWTH ALBEIT AT A HIGHER LEVEL GOING TO ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE MERE ENVISIONED BY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. IN OUR ESTIMATION THE USE OF HIGHER REVENUE PROJECTIONS INTRODUCES A GREATER DEGREE OF FISCAL RISKS TO THE BUDGET IN THE OUT YEARS. ESPECIALLY IF THOSE FUTURE PROJECTED REVENUE SUPPORT FURTHER ONGOING SPENDING. CALIFORNIA'S REVENUE PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A HIGH LEVEL OF VOLATILITY THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE HIGHEST INCOME CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO PAY A SIGNIFICANT SHARE THE STATE INCOME TAX. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE TOP 1% OF EARNERS ACCOUNTED FOR OVER FORTY BURKE 46% OF ALL PERSONAL INCOME TAXES. THAT'S JUST OVER A HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND TAX RETURNS. A CORRECTION IN THE STOCK MARKET NOT EVEN A RECESSION COULD RESULT IN SERIOUS NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO REVENUES. ON TOP OF THIS NATURAL VOLATILITY THERE'S ALSO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AROUND BUILDING THIS BUDGET COMPARED TO OTHER BUDGETS. BECAUSE OF THE INFLUX OF SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL FUNDING AND THE INCOMING RULES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF THESE FUNDS. THIS IS EVIDENCED IN EVENTS HAVE UNFOLDED SUBSEQUENT TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A REVISION. THE RECENTLY RELEASED FEDERAL GUIDELINES FOR THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN ACT OR ARAFAT THE ADMINISTRATION LEARNED THAT TO CHILD CARE PROPOSALS INCLUDED IN AMERICA ASIAN. CANNOT RELY ON THOSE FUNDS AND THEN OUT WILL NOW REQUIRE I'M PLAN GENERAL FUND BACKED BILLS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. AND BEYOND TO MAINTAIN THESE IMPORTANT PROPOSALS. THIS IS JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THE UNCERTAINTY BEHIND PROPOSALS FOR WHICH GUIDELINES WILL BE PROMULGATED LATER THAT COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT HELP YOUR IMPACTS EVEN AFTER FINAL BUDGET HAS BEEN PASSED. THE MERE INVASIONS OF REVENUE FORECAST IS MORE CAUTIOUS THAN THE ALLEY OWES TO COUNT FOR THESE RISKS. THE MAIN REVISIONS BUDGET STRUCTURE LIKEWISE IS PROMISED ON ONE TIME SPENDING OVER ONGOING SPENDING WITH 90% OF DISCRETIONARY SPENDING BEING ONE TIME. AND ONLY 10% INVESTED IN TARGETED ON GOING PRIORITIES. THIS APPROACH ENABLES US TO PULL BACK REDUCE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES WHILE ONGOING COMMITMENTS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO QUICKLY UNWIND OR CUT ONGOING ENTITLEMENT STATUTORY OR CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATIONS. SHOULD THE STATE NEED TO RESPOND IMMEDIATELY TWENTY GOLD NEGATIVE FISCAL. THAT SAID THERE ARE MANY SHARE PRIORITIES ON BOTH THE ASSEMBLY'S PLAN IN THE MAY REVISION AGAIN THE ADMINISTRATION LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON THE DETAILS OF THIS EXTRAORDINARY ONCE IN A. GENERATION BUDGET THAT WILL SUPPORT MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT THESE COMMENTS THE COMMITTEE MY COLLEAGUES AND I ARE AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU MR AS WE GO BACK TO. THIS REVERSE AND THEN TO MISTER SMITH. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING. OUR CHAIR- AND ARE. ALL THE BUDGET STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK. ON THIS AMAZING BUDGET A ONCE IN A LIFETIME I THINK. A BUDGET I'M VERY PROUD TO SERVE ON THIS COMMITTEE. I WANT TO ALSO THANK. OUR BUDGET SUB TO CHAIR MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO. FOR SUPPORTING UNIVERSAL SCHOOL MEALS- THAT THAT HAS BEEN SOMETHING THAT I HAVE WORKED ON AND IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME AND I'M GLAD. THAT WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT NO CHILD. IS HUNGRY IN A CALIFORNIA SCHOOL AND THAT WE WILL BE THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO DO THAT- I WAS ALSO VERY HAPPY TO SEE. AN INVESTMENT- AT CAL STATE UNIVERSITY NORTHRIDGE WHICH IS- VERY CLOSE TO MY DISTRICT IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY. FOR A CENTER FOR EQUITY AND INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY- VERY PROUD- THAT THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WILL HOST. OF THIS INNOVATION CENTER THAT WILL HELP YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. ARE IN TERMS OF. ANOTHER ISSUE AREA THAT I'VE BEEN WORKING ON HAS BEEN HOMELESSNESS- I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR CHAIR AND OF COURSE OUR BUDGET SUB CHAIR- FROM LOS ANGELES FOR THE SIGNIFICANT WORK ON HOMELESSNESS. THIS YEAR IN THE BUDGET PROCESS- AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN FIGHTING TO ENSURE WITH THAT WE INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS. TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS BOTH THROUGH POLICY AND THROUGH THE BUDGET. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS OF THE BRING CALIFORNIA HOME COALITION. AND OUR MAYORS FOR THEIR AMAZING ADVOCACY I'M THANKFUL THAT OUR ASSEMBLY LEADERSHIP RECOGNIZE THAT NOW IS THE TIME TO INVEST HEAVILY IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE PROVEN. TO REDUCE OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. WE STILL HAVE AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF WORK AHEAD OF US OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF WEEKS TO ENSURE THAT THE LANGUAGE. ACCOMPANYING THESE BUDGET INVESTMENTS ENSURES ACCOUNTABILITY IN LOCAL AND STATE USE OF THE FUNDS AND ADVANCES NECESSARY STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO ENSURE EFFICIENCY. OF THESE ALLOCATED FUNDS. I'D LIKE TO BE CLEAR THAT. ARE AS WHEN WE STARTED THIS YEAR THINKING WE WERE GOING INTO A RECESSION AND ENDED UP WITH A SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE BILLION SURPLUS YOU KNOW. I THINK IT SHOWS THAT OUR OUR STATE REVENUES FLUCTUATE GREATLY AND WE NEED AN ONGOING BUDGET COMMITMENT TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS EVEY YEAR- I SERVE I AM VERY LUCKY TO SERVE ON BUDGET SUB THREE- I'D LIKE TO THANK OUR CHAIR FROM SANTA MONICA- NOW THAT I AM CHAIR OF NATURAL RESOURCES IT'S GREAT TO SERVE ON BOTH. THE BUDGET AND POLICY COMMITTEES I'M AND YOU KNOW. I I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON PROGRAMS THAT BENEFIT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES BECAUSE- WE HAVE SUFFERED THE MOST. ESPECIALLY DURING COLD BED WITH MUCH HIGHER RATE OF LOST JOBS EVICTIONS AND UTILITIES THAT. NO CURRENTLY THERE HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS IN EXISTING FUNDS FOR SERVICES AVAILABLE TO THESE COMMUNITIES BUT WE'RE NOT EFFECTIVELY. CONNECT IN THESE INDIVIDUALS WITH THESE FREE RESOURCES LIKE UTILITY BILL SAVINGS CLEAN AFFORDABLE ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION REBATES. ARE IT'LL ALSO- I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS CONCERNS ON. THE ABANDONED WELLS THE BUDGET THAT THE BUDGET ITEM. AB IF THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSAL TO SHIFT WHO PAYS FOR THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONING OF OIL AND GAS WELLS- TRADITIONALLY WE'VE MADE OIL COMPANIES PAY TO PLUG AND ABANDON ORPHANED OIL AND GAS WELLS- BUT THIS YEAR- THERE IS A SHIFT ON WHO'S PAYING FOR THE PLUGGING AND ABANDONING OF THESE WELLS- SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THIS RATIONALE FOR THE SHIFT AND EVALUATE WHETHER IT MAKES SENSE. AND I HOPE THAT IN THE NEXT COMING WEEKS WE CAN COME UP YOU KNOW SOMEONE FROM THE ADMINISTRATION CAN EXPLAIN THE SHAFT AND MAKING OF THE PUBLIC FISCAL. RESPONSIBILITY FOR OIL COMPANIES ABANDONMENT OF AN UNUSED OIL WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU WERE GOING TO GO TO MR FONG AND THEN MISTER SMITH. I THINK WE SHOULD CARE- I DID WANT TO ASK A FEW QUESTIONS SINCE WE HAVE FOLKS- THE MEDIAN AND I'M- MISTER PECK AB. ON THE OTHER LINE MAYBE ACCESS- MR PADDICK. YOU'VE DONE AN ANALYSIS- ON THE GOVERNOR'S REVISION WHAT IS YOUR INITIAL TAKE ON THIS FRAMEWORK. GOOD EVENING- CAROLINE SHOOT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. IN JAPAN I'M SORRY MISS MR PANIC I WAS IN THAT THE SENATE HEARING AND THEREFORE COULD NOT LOG ON TO ON TO THE HEARING- THIS AFTERNOON NO WORRIES CAN YOU HEAR ME YES. OKAY I'M SORRY WE HAVE WE ARE ONLY RECEIVE THE DETAILS OF THE LEGISLATURE PACKAGE- A DAY OR TWO AGO WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY. TO ABSOLUTELY- GET OUR ARMS AROUND THE WHOLE THING YOU DO IS YOU ARE SPENDING PLAN. OUT ONCE- THE FINAL PACKAGE IS- ADAPTED AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR WHICH WE TEND TO DO LATER IN JULY. I AND THEN FINAL ACTIONS IN OCTOBER. SO I KNOW YOU I KNOW IT'S REAL TO ME DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL THOUGHTS OR- IN TERMS OF. WHAT KIND OF. SPEEDING THROUGH THIS REVIEW BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY DOING A REVIEWS SO I LIKE AND IF THEY'RE SENT. IF THERE'S A THE PERSPECTIVE FROM THE L. L. A. IT CERTAINLY WOULD BE- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL. SURE SO WE AGAIN WE HAVEN'T WE HAVEN'T HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO A FULL ASSESSMENT OF THE EXPENDITURES ARE OR GET OUR ARMS AROUND THE ENTIRE THING- I COULD. YOU KNOW KNOW THAT THEIR PACKAGE DOESN'T DROPPED OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES ON WHICH AS THE- WORK WAS ALREADY NOTED ARE- A GROWTH IT FASTER THAN BY THOSE- PRESENTED BY THE ADMINISTRATION AND AS WE'VE NOTED IN. OUR VARIOUS WRITE UPS- WE BELIEVE. I HAVE UP HAVE ESSENTIALLY A FIFTY FIFTY CHANCE OF- MATERIALIZING- AND SO THEY ARE BASED ON THE HISTORICAL GROWTH RATES AFTER REVENUES IN THE STATE ACTUALLY A LITTLE BIT LOWER- ACCOUNTING FOR SOME POLICIES THAT WILL TURN OFF SO WE ASSUME REVENUES WERE GROWING ABOUT FOUR PERCENT- IN THE- OUT YEARS- WHICH- WHICH CAN SUPPORT- HIGHER. SPENDING THEN UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATES- AND AGAIN AS WE'VE STATED HISTORICALLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CHOOSE ITS REVENUES AND EXPENDITURES BASED ON ITS- ON ITS RISK TOLERANCE AND WANTING TO SPEAK IS WILL HAPPEN IN FUTURE YEARS. OKAY LET OF THEM ASK YOU A SPECIFICALLY AND IN TERMS THE- TO YOUR PREVIOUS ANALYSIS SO THE- THE CERTAINLY THE THAT. MR PECK MADE SAM HEADLINES- IN TERMS OF. BEING L. SOMEWHAT CRITICAL OF THE GOVERNOR'S VISION. OF USING- BUDGET TOOLS- RESERVE WITHDRAWALS AND BORROWING- BUT THEN ALSO- WITH THE GOVERNOR WAS ALSO USING THAT TO CONTINUE SPENDING THAT- THIS FRAMEWORK MY UNDERSTANDING DOESN'T UNDO THAT SO THAT WAS THAT WOULD THAT CONCERNS STILL REMAIN. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT'S THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OR IN THIS FRAMEWORK. THIS PACKAGE TAKES SOME SOME DIFFERENT ACTIONS IN ORDER TO- AT BUILD SOME ADDITIONAL BUDGET RESILIENCY SO IT- UNDERLIES THE REMAINING DEFERRALS- TO SCHOOLS WHICH IS ABOUT TWO POINT SIX BILLION I BELIEVE IT ALSO PREPARES ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF BOND DEBT. AND MAKES AN ADDITIONAL- SAFETY NET RESERVE DEPOSIT- I BELIEVE AROUND AROUND A BILLION DOLLARS- SO IT TAKES DIFFERENT ACTIONS TO PROVIDE MORE BUDGET RESILIENCY- AND THE LEGISLATURE FACES CHOICES ABOUT HOW IT WANTS TO PREPARE FOR A FUTURE RECESSION. OKAY IN TERMS OF- AND I AGREE I THINK THAT THE- THE PROPOSAL TO PAY DOWN- THE DEFERRALS IS- IS A COURSE THAT- WE AS THE LEGISLATURE WE SHOULD DO HI SO I CERTAINLY OF- I THINK THAT THAT'S- A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION- IN TERMS. OF. THE MAYBE I CAN MAYBE THIS QUESTION IS BETTER DRESSED- TO THE POVERTY FINANCED BUT- WHAT IS THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL OR THE JUSTIFICATION OF NOT- OF NOT REVERSING THE- TO TAX INCREASES FROM FROM LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WE SIR I THINK THE FRAMEWORK AND IN THIS BUDGET DOESN'T- THE TAXI HOUSES AS WELL SO. MAYBE YOU CAN MAYBE I CAN JUST UNDERSTAND THE PERSPECTIVE OF WE WERE AN EMERGENCY SITUATION LAST YEAR THE PROJECTIONS WERE WHAT THEY WERE AND THEY WERE ENDED UP. BEING TOO LOW BUT NOW THAT WE'RE KIND OF IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT WHY WOULD WE NOT- UNDER THE TAX INCREASES IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET. AND I'M GONNA TURN THIS ONE OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE RYAN MILLER. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WOULD YOU MIND PERHAPS CLARIFYING WHICH TAX INCREASES ARE ARE YOU REFERRING TO- I BELIEVE THAT- THE LEGISLATURE TAKE ACTION ON THAT OPERATING LOSSES ON REMOVALS OF TAX CREDITS AND CLEAN THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT- SO. THAT I THINK WAS A NINETY NINE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN. HAND TAX INCREASES IN THE PREVIOUS BUDGET I WAS DONE NOW THAT WE'RE IN THIS NEW ENVIRONMENT WHY WOULD WE NOT AND DO THOSE. THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION- SO AS YOU NOTED- LAST YEAR'S BUDGET DID. AND CERTAIN TAX CREDITS AVAILABLE- GENERALLY TO LARGER CORPORATIONS I THINK I THINK IN THE ADMINISTRATION'S JUDGMENT- THOSE ACTIONS- AFFECTED- ENTITIES THAT- TENDED TO BE AS I SAID KIND OF LARGER CORPORATIONS INTENDED TO- ALSO- IN MANY CASES BE ENTITIES THAT WERE SORT OF WEATHERING THE PANDEMIC RELATIVELY WELL AND IN OUR- JUDGMENT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET NAY REVISION- WE ATTEMPTED TO FOCUS MORE ON. A SMALL BUSINESSES- CERTAIN- YOU KNOW BUSINESS ENTITIES THAT MAY BE STRUGGLING TO A GREATER EXTENT IN THE PANDEMIC- SO I THINK THAT'S ESSENTIALLY AND NOT SHELL AND THAT AND THAT'S WHY WE PRIORITIZE THINGS LIKE- YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROPOSAL- THE FILM CREDIT EXPANSION AND- AND OTHER SIMILAR PROPOSALS OVER RESTORING THE- THE ACTIONS THAT YOU MENTIONED. SO WAS THAT A JUSTIFICATION OF THAT YOU'D THAT THOSE TAX INCREASES OR DOES HE USE A POSTPONEMENTS THEY'RE NEVER GOING AWAY- OR IT WITH. THE GOVERNOR. AGREE THAT AT SOME POINT THEY NEED TO GO AWAY FOR THE THEY NEED TO BE REVERSED. I BELIEVE THEY WERE TEMPORARY SUSPENSIONS I DON'T KNOW IF- CAROLINE ARE YOU FROM THE ELLIA COULD SPEAK TO THAT- BUT BUT- YES THIS IS CAROLYN SURE AGAIN THEY ARE TEMPORARY TAX INCREASES UNABLE TO TURN THEY WERE FOR THREE YEARS- SO I BELIEVE THAT MEANS IN TURN OFF AND- TWENTY. THREE TWENTY PARK. OKAY BUT BUT THOSE THAT THREE YEAR TIME FRAME WAS OF COURSE THE UNCERTAINTY OF LAST YEAR. SO NOW WE HAVE THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS THIS YEAR HICH IS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER SO IS THERE OF. HIS AT SOME POINT WHAT WHEN WOULD THAT BE REASSESSED. BY THE LEVI YEAH I FIGURED OUT THAT IF YOU LEAVE THE TAX INCREASES TO FOR THEIR FOR TWO MORE YEARS. I THINK I WOULD JUST GO BACK TO MY PRIOR COMMENTS ABOUT SORT OF THE RELATIVE FOCUS OF THE ADMINISTRATION'S TAX PROPOSALS AND IN THIS BUDGET MAYOR VISION. OKAY THEN THAT ACTUALLY TO ME TO THE NEXT QUESTION I THINK YOU TEED IT UP VERY WELL SO THE FOCUS ON SMALL BUSINESSES. SO THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES- BUT PROPOSED ABOUT ONE POINT ONE BILLION TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND DEBT. AT THIS FRAMEWORK I THINK TAKES A DIFFERENT APPROACH AND- PROVIDES TRY TO PROVIDE THEM ASSEMBLY- ASSISTANCE TO SMALL BUSINESSES. AND IN A DIFFERENT WAY- BUT- AS WE'VE SEEN FROM PREVIOUS SITUATIONS WHERE BOND DEBT OR THAT YOU HAD YOU I FIND THAT- OCCURRED TO AND IT I THINK IT TOOK TEN YEARS TO PAY OFF THE DEBT FROM THE GREAT RECESSION BEFORE- AND- THAT LEAD THAT THE DEBT RIGHT NOW WILL LEAD TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BUSINESSES. PAYROLL TAXES- SMALL BUSINESSES AS YOU MENTIONED. SO WHAT WOULD THE GOVERNOR SAY IN TERMS OF SICK PUTTING MORE MONEY. OR TAKING CARE OF THE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR DEBT. THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. AND I'M GONNA TURN THAT WENT OVER TO MR CHRIS COOK. COULD DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO NUMBER IT IT MAYBE IF YOU CAN HELP ME CLARIFY YOUR QUESTION AND FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND- FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE LEGISLATIVE PACKAGE IS PROPOSING TO PROVIDE TO TWO BILLION OVER SEVERAL YEARS- FOR- TAX CREDITS FOR SMALL BUSINESSES. RIGHT SO I LOOK I'VE MICHAEL I HAVE MY CONCERNS WITH THIS LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK AS WELL I THINK THAT THIS ARE LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK SHOULD OFFICE ALSO TAKE CARE OF THE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS YOU I FIND IT SO AS THE LEGISLATURE NEGOTIATES WITH YOU- I GOT IN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. IS THERE AN AGREEMENT THAT THERE SHOULD BE- A SIGNIFICANT- INVESTMENT IN TAKING CARE OF THE DATE OF THE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR. DEBT THAT CURRENTLY EXISTS IN THE U. I. FUND OR DO YOU DISAGREE WITH THE FRAMEWORK. THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS PUT TOGETHER AND YOU WOULD GO BACK TO- WHAT YOU GUYS PROPOSED. WHY I THINK THOSE CONVERSATIONS YOU KNOW. HAPPY TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS IN THE COMING WEEKS ON YOU KNOW THE PRIORITIES. I WILL SAY THAT THE ONE BILLION- IN THE- FEDERAL DOLLARS OVER SIXTY TWO ARCA. WAS BALANCE SEEN THE OTHER PRIORITIES THAT THAT THEY ADMIT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD WITH THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS. AND SO WE FELT THAT ONE BILLION ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS WAS AN INVESTMENT THAT COULD BE MADE OUT TO HELP ALLEVIATE SOME OF THE PRESSURE ON THE U. LIKE THAT. BUT AGAIN THOSE CONVERSATIONS WILL CONTINUE IN THE COMING WEEKS ON. WHAT THOSE PARTIES LOOK LIKE BY THE WAY. OKAY I WOULD JUST ARGUE THAT THAT MAY WAITING WE SHOULD WE AS THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AND WE AS AN INDIGO STATIONS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU SHOULD. LOOK AT A MORE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT AND I THINK THAT THE CONVERSATIONS OF THE CHAIR WILL HAVE- WITH THE SENATE AND WITH THE WITH THE MINISTRATION I JUST. THINK THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT- CHALLENGE THAT WHERE WE SEE WE UNDERSTAND IT'S HAPPENED IN THE PAST AND- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO- THE HAVE TO ADDRESS I ALSO ONE ECHO- THE ISSUE THAT IS PART OF MY COLLEAGUES AROUND US- THE LPS- ISSUE IS. IS THIS THE BEST THING TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER WE'RE GONNA DEAL WITH AS WELL I JUST WANNA AND BY SAYING THAT- IN TERMS OF- PUBLIC SAFETY IS THIS A FIVE- IF. IF I COULD ASK- THE DIFFERENT FINANCE IN TERMS OF THE OFFICE OF YOU THINK COMMITTEE RESTORATION AND THE- DJJ REALIGNMENT- WHAT IS THE CURRENT PROCESS- CURRENTLY- WITH THIS NEW OFFICE AND WHAT'S THE CURRENT STATUS IF YOU DON'T ME ASKING. I'M SO THE OFFICE IS ESTABLISHED ON JULY FIRST PURSUANT TO STATUTE AND WE HAVE A MAJOR REVISION PROPOSAL I'M THAT AUGMENTED THE OFFICE- IN ADDITION TO WHAT WE HAD INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. I THINK ADAM DORSEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THE DETAILS OF THAT PROPOSAL AND WITH THAT SAID THE LEGISLATURE HAS ADDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE OFFICE- ANYTHING WE'RE STILL WORKING THROUGH THE DETAILS OF THAT- THAT AUGMENTATION. OKAY GO IT IS THERE IS ANY MORE INFORMATION THAT I YOU MUCH AS SOMEONE ELSE I APOLOGIZE IF I GOT THE ONE OF. SURE THIS IS ADAM DORSEY- DEPARTMENT FINANCE- THAT REVISION AT INCLUDE SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION GENERAL FUND- IN THE BUDGET YOU'RE IN THIRTY THREE POSITIONS FOR THE OFFICE. OKAY I DID WANT TO APPLY THE A TEN MILLION DOLLARS EMERGENCY FUNDING THROUGH THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES- TO SUPPORT- THE ACTIVITIES TO PREVENT. HUMAN TRAFFICKING I THINK THAT'S- NEEDED INVESTMENT. ESPECIALLY DURING THE DOWNTURN- YOU KNOW NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAPPENS- SERVING HIS VICTIMS THEY'VE BEEN- AFFECTED AS WELL. AND YOU KNOW HUMAN TRAFFICKING HAS CERTAINLY GOTTEN WORSE AND AFFECTING COMMUNITIES OF OLOR OVER THE PANDEMIC- I DID WHAT I ALSO WANT TO JUST SAY THAT THE DROUGHT- IN RESILIENCE PACKAGE AND THE- THE WILDFIRE PREVENTION RESILIENCE. PACKAGE% THOSE DETAILS OF THEM HAVEN'T BEEN FLESHED OUT SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT AS WE VOTE FOR. THESE PROPOSALS THAT WE DON'T KNOW HOW THAT'S- HOUSE WHAT THE SPECIFICS ARE AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO EMPHASIZE- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO DROUGHT AND WATER RESILIENCE- AND SIGMA. WE NEED. TO BE INVESTING IN WATER STORAGE. AND WATER AND FIRST- WE HAVE OPPORTUNITY IN THE PAST- THAT I BELIEVE THE STATE WASTED- WITH THE WATER FOR THE WATER BOND THAT THAT WAS PASSED. THAT DID NOT- PUT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN THIS WATER STORAGE- AND SO I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD- LET THIS OPPORTUNITY GO AND IF WE IF WE DON'T INVEST IN WATER STORAGE. WITH THE WITH THE OPPORTUNITY THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW- I THINK OUR STATE WILL REGRET. THE LACK OF INVESTMENT FOR THE NEXT DROUGHT COMES AROUND. AND AND I THINK IT'S A AND THE EFFECTS OF. A SIGMA WILL BE- MORE SEVERE IN OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE CANNOT GET TO SUSTAINABILITY WHICH IS WHAT SIGNAL WANTED. WITHOUT THESE NEEDED INVESTMENTS SO. WHILE WE HAVE THIS DEBATE- RIGHT NOW- A LOT OF DETAILS ARE STILL. NOT DONE AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE TO THE PUBLIC- THAT A LOT OF WORK STILL REMAINS IN SO WE AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY- NEED TO COME TOGETHER TO FIND THOSE SOLUTIONS SO I I'M OUT I'LL TURN BACK OVER THE CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. IF YOU WERE GONNA MISTER SMITH. THANK YOU- I JUST WANT TO PUBLIC THAT SO WATCH IT AT HOME THAT THE THIS BUDGET HERE'S FOUR HUNDRED PAGES. WE RECEIVED IT YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ABOUT FOUR O'CLOCK SO LITTLE OVER TWENTY FOUR HOURS AGO TO GO THROUGH ALL THIS OF BUDGET. PROPOSALS AND WERE EXPECTED TO VOTE ON IT TONIGHT. WHAT I WANT TO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WE HAD A OF. THE PRESENTATION THIS MORNING FOR CHARITY. AND THE DEFERRALS FOR THE SCHOOLS- WE WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE ALL PAID OFF OR WHEN ACID DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IF ALL THE DEFERRALS THAT WERE OF MONEY FROM THE SCHOOLS LAST YEAR IS ALL BEING PAID BACK. CHRIS FERGUSON WHAT FINANCED UNDER THE ASSEMBLY SENATE PACKAGE THERE ARE REPAYING ALL THOSE DEFERRALS- THE ADMINISTRATION PACKAGE STILL- PUT FORWARD A SMALL REMAINING TO PEARL IN THE K. TWELVE SECTOR. BECAUSE I THINK IT'S CRITICAL I WANTED CHAIRED THANK CHAIRED PAYING FOR MAKING SURE THAT THAT HAPPENS TO PAY OFF THE DEFERRALS BECAUSE WE BORROW MONEY AND WE DON'T PAY IT OFF WE'RE NOT GETTING AHEAD OF THE GAME HERE- IN THE COMMENTS REGARDS THE WATER IN DROUGHT RESILIENCE. THE THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN ROOM OF BIKESHARE FONG JUST MENTION IT THERE'S NO MINCING OF WATER STORAGE. IS THERE ANY LANGUAGE OR ANYONE CAN COMMENT TO THAT FOR WATER STORAGE. NOW BECAUSE OF PROP ONE A. BONDS- TEN YEARS AGO WE GOT NO WATER STORAGE OUT OF THAT IS ARE ANY. I THINK ANYBODY THAT WANTS WATER STORAGE IN CALIFORNIA. IN IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL THOSE WE HAVE NOT IRONED OUT ALL THE DETAILS IN THE WATER PACKAGE I DON'T KNOW ABOUT IF THE ADMINISTRATION HAD ANY- WATER STORAGE IN THEIR PROPOSAL- AND THEN- WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT WE WOULD HAVE INPUT ON THIS PACKAGE. I DON'T NOT SURE WHEN IT'S GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPOSED TO VOTE ON IT THIS EVENING AND I KNOW WE GOT TILL- JUNE FIFTEENTH TO GET THIS BUDGET. WHEN ARE WE GONNA HAVE SOME LANGUAGE. THE INCLUDES SEVERAL PACKAGES ALL OVER TWENTY TWO BILLION DOLLARS. BUT THERE'S NOT NOT NO DETAILS. TO TELL AS A WONDER WE'RE GOING TO BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION. I GUESS WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE A PART OF A LAWSUIT YOU ARE- YOU'RE PART OF THE CONVERSATION TODAY TO BE A PART OF THE CONVERSATION BETWEEN NOW AND- WHEN WE VOTE ON THE BUDGET FOR JUNE FIFTEENTH. KERN I WANT TO CHECK THIS THANK MY CHAIR BLOOM FOR SUB THREE FOR ALL YOUR HARD WORK THIS YEAR. THE END OF IT'S NOT EASY- EXPECTED FROM MY POINT OF VIEW AND ANOTHER OF THE SITUATION FOR THE BROADBAND. THE OF IT WAS MENTIONED FROM CHERRY BLOOM IT'S SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OVER SEVEN YEARS. BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MY RURAL DISTRICT GETS OF ITS PERCENTAGE. OF THAT MONEY. FOR BROADBAND BECAUSE WE REALLY NEEDED OUT THERE WITH THE KIDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN TO SCHOOL IN THE LAST YEAR. AND NOT HAVING THE RESOURCES OF BROADBAND. UP FOR EDUCATION THEY'VE LOST OVER SIXTEEN MONTHS OF THEIR EDUCATION BUT I DON'T THINK THAT THEY WILL EVER GET BACK UP. AND HOPEFULLY WE STAY IN THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE ARE GOING TO GO TO- MISTER BENNETT AND INTO MR GALLAGHER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR FOR MY PARTNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER pOUT THAT I APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- REMINDING US OR POINTING OUT TO US JUST. OF THE IMPORTANT DISTINCTION BETWEEN ONE TIME FUNDING AND ONGOING FUNDING BETWEENONE TIME REVENUE AND ONGOING REVENUE AND THE PARTICULAR NEED THAT WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO THAT BECAUSE OF THE VARIABILITY. OF OUR BUDGET BUT ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE SOME THINGS THAT ARE BUDGET THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL THAT WE FUND AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THAT CUSHION SO THAT WE CAN ALWAYS KEEP THAT FUNDING- MOVING FORWARD. SECOND AB I REALLY APPRECIATED HEARING FROM THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEES AND THE ISSUES THAT THEY'VE BEEN WRESTLING WITH WALL HAVE WE BEEN IN SUBCOMMITTEE THREE- AND SO I WANT TO POINT OUT HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE. OF SUB COMMITTEE FOR SO PROVE OF THE SHOW SERENA A FARMWORKER HOUSING GRANT PROGRAM- THAT'S A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR NEW FARM WORKER HOUSING PROJECTS. THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR EXISTING PROJECTS- AND- THAT IS THE KIND OF INVESTMENT THAT I THINK CALIFORNIA REALLY NEED TO KEEP MAKING. HOUSING THAT WE KNOW IS GOING TO BE AFFORDABLE IS FARMWORKER HOUSING AND THAT KIND OF HOUSING IS WHERE WE OUGHT TO FOCUS OUR ENERGIES- I ALSO. WANT TO APPLAUD THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE- FOR THE- EFFORTS TO PUSH FOR DEBT FREE CALIFORNIAN TO KEEP THAT ALIVE AND KEEP THAT MOVING IT'S WHERE WE REALLY. NEED TO END UP- AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET THERE- I ALSO REALLY APPLAUD THE- PUSH FOR IN STATE STUDENTS TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND UCLA AND BERKELEY AND SAN DIEGO- AND- THEN THE- OTHER POINT. OF WHAT TO MAKE IS THE HOMELESS. FUNDING IS CERTAINLY A LOT OF OUR MIND RIGHT NOW. I WOULD OFFER YOU THAT PROBABLY NEXT YEAR AT THIS TIME WE'LL BE TALKING ABOUT DROUGHT FUNDING ALSO AND DROUGHT RESILIENCY FUNDING- AND THAT WILL BE A NEW PATIENT. AND SO WE SHOULD ANTICIPATE THAT- IN ADVANCE I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS BUT I DON'T WANT TO BELABOR THIS SO I WILL ASK THOSE. OFF SITE BUT THEIR QUESTIONS ABOUT THE IMPACTS ON ON CHILD CARE FROM THE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM- WILL HOW MUCH REAL DECREASE THAT'S ALL I'LL TALK TO THE CHAIR- SOME OF THE ISSUES ON FEE INCREASES AND SUB SUB COMMITTEE THREE- THAT WE TALKED ABOUT BUT I'LL DO THOSE OFFLINE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOISTURE THANK YOU WILL GO TO MISTER GALLAGHER THE MISGUIDED OR- YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANTED TO YOU- FIRST OFF SAY. MY APPRECIATION TO YOU AND THE VICE CHAIR- THE GUNS AND- YOU KNOW VERY GOOD WORK THIS YEAR ON THE BUDGET. I THINK ITWAS SAID EARLIER HOW. I THINK AMONGST ALL THE COMMITTEES THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HAS WORKED IN A VERY BIPARTISAN MANNER- THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS I THINK WE HAVE A LOT TO REALLY- BE PROUD OF AND THE WORK THAT WAS DONE THIS YEAR AND- CERTAINLY WORKING IN THE- IN BUDGET SUB TWO. ON EDUCATION ISSUES OF APPRECIATED THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE I THINK WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO SOME GOOD WORK IN. CUTTERY ALREADY RE ORDERING- THE PRIORITIES OF THE GOVERNOR HAD HAD SET OUT AND I THINK. MAKING- GETTING BACK TO SOME OF THE BASICS THAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF BUT ALSO MAKING SOME. SMART INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE SO- HAPPY ABOUT THAT WORK MY ONE QUESTION IS JUST ON- AS YOU CAN PROBABLY IMAGINE ON THE WILDFIRE- FRONT- IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THEY HAD PROPOSED A- TRAILER BILL TO CONTINUE THE ANNUAL APPROPRIATION OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION. AND G. R. F. PURSUANT TO SB NINE A ONE. THROUGH THE. TWENTY EIGHT. TWENTY NINE FISCAL YEAR IN OTHER WORDS IN ANOTHER FIVE YEARS OF CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION- I BELIEVE THE STAFF COMMENTS- FROM THAT WAS THAT THAT LANGUAGES WAS UNNECESSARY- IS THERE A REASON FOR THAT MAYBE JUST A STAFFER IF THAT MAYBE SOMEBODY CAN ANSWER I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO SEE US. TRY TO MAKE THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO A CONTINUOUS- APPROPRIATION FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS- ON THAT. ABOUT TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A BEGAN TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THAT BEGAN WITH- SB NINE A ONE. THE. AND I AM I'LL TURN THAT WENT OVER TO STEVEN BENSON FOR COMMENTS FROM THE ADMINISTRATION. THE SERVER MINISTRATION STANDPOINT THAT WE HAD PROPOSED THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE- IN ORDER TO LIKELY TO USE IT TO SAY THAT YOU SAID ASSEMBLY MEMBER I HAVE TO CONTINUE THAT COMMITMENT I WILL NOTE. THAT THE ACTUAL SB NINE NO ONE DOESN'T RATE THE FUNDING IT EXPRESSES THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE YOU THAT- BUT I'LL DEFER TO BE YEAH. ASSEMBLY STAFF IN TERMS OF ITS ACTION TO SAY THAT THE TV I WAS UNNECESSARY I THINK THAT WAS REALLY- TENSION AS WELL ALL THE PARTICULAR ACCOUNT SO THAT. MR CARTER CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION FOR ASSEMBLY STUFF. JUST RESTART WHY WE KIND OF WANTED TO REJECT THAT I GUESS AND SAY IT'S NOT NECESSARY I GUESS I WOULD PUSH- FOR US TO IN OUR FINAL BUDGET THAT WE PASSED TO. MAKE THAT COMMITMENT TO A FIVE YEAR CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION. YEAH I THINK THERE'S A HESITATION- ACCORDING TO A BUNCH OF STUFF TO DO A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AS WE HAVE DONE WITH SOME OTHER ITEMS I KNOW IT'S BEEN A SOURCE OF FRUSTRATION- WHETHER WE AGREE OR DISAGREE WITH. THE HIGH SPEED RAIL APPROPRIATION AND THE- HE HAS GOT PRODUCTION FUND. I THINK SIMILAR TO THAT THERE WAS HESITATION TO DO FURTHER- FOR THE CONTINUED APPROPRIATIONS. I THINK IT IS THE IT IS DEFINITELY. THE INTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR. TO STICK BY THAT AGREEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU BYE THERE'S. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK ALSO- MY SEVEN TWO CHAIR CHARM MCCARTY AND MY SEVEN FIVE CHAIR- ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA- FOR REALLY SOME GREAT LEADERSHIP- WE HAVE ACCOMPLISHED SOME GREAT THINGS IN A BIPARTISAN FASHION THIS YEAR THERE'S STILL A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND THERE ARE STILL NO MANY CRITICAL CRISIS LEVEL ISSUES THAT OUR STATE IS DEALING WITH- AND THIS BUDGET DOES YOU KNOW ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE- HER BY PROVIDING. NECESSARY RESOURCES- I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS HERE THE ONE THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT TO SUPPORT HERE- BUT I WAS CURIOUS TO KNOW WHETHER ANYTHING IN THIS BUDGET PROVIDES FUNDING TO HELP REDUCE THE NEED AND THE NEED FOR AN TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF I KNOW THAT IN OUR- PACKAGE WE HAVE A BILLION. A BIT OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS ASIDE FOR WILDFIRE PREVENTION AND RESILIENCE AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET I THINK THERE'S ONE POINT NINE BILLION- BUT THOSE DETAILS OF HOW THOSE BILLIONS. THE MOMENT SO I'M WOOD THE BOTH- IF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE CAN TELL ME- IS THE- DISCUSS ARE ARE WE SPOKE PREVIOUSLY- AT ASKING YOU PREVIOUSLY IN SOME OF OUR BUDGET HEARINGS- IF THE- DEPARTMENT FINANCES CONSIDERING- REFUNDING MONEY FOR THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE GRANTS- WHICH FOR DEBT WHICH DIRECTLY IMPACT PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS- AND THAT THAT ACCESS TO SORRY AND NEED FOR THE ACCESS TO FUNDING FOR. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. STEVEN BENSON WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO WE DID NOT PROPOSE FUNDING SPECIFIC THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS THIS YEAR HOWEVER THE ADMINISTRATION DID PROPOSED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR COMMUNITY RESILIENCE MORE GENERALLY AND THE IDEA BEHIND THAT WAS TO. BASICALLY WORK WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS NOT ENOUGH I WITH THEIR GREATEST NEED DARK IN BEEN A DRESS THOSE NEEDS WITHIN THAT LARGER PART OF FUNDING SO PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFF. MAYBE THE GREATEST NEED IN THE GREATEST. DEFICIENCY PERSEVERATION BUT IT'S NOT FOR ALL. SO RATHER THAN HAVING ONE SPECIFIC SMALLER PART OF MONEY LIMITED TO THAT ONE PURPOSE WE PROPOSED A LARGER APPROPRIATE A LARGER CORPORATION. THAT COULD BE USED FOR MORE GENERAL ALL HAZARDS APPROACH AND THAT WOULD BE ADMINISTERED BY WORKING WITH LOCAL SENECA REGIONAL BASIS- IDENTIFY THE GREATEST NEEDS AND ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS. I WILL NOTE THAT ARE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL HAS BEEN REDUCED BY BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE DOWN TO A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. SO THE ABILITY TO ADDRESS. AND THOSE NEEDS A THE STATE IS GONNA BE HAPPY REDUCE- PORTLAND. SO WOULD CITIES AND TRIBES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS TO BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR GRANTS FOR. SOLAR POWER SOLAR POWER BATTERIES BACKUPS- GENERATORS- IN WHAT THE TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION AND THAT PROPOSAL. YES THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR PROPOSAL WAS VERY FLEXIBLE IN GENERAL TO ALLOW FOR INFRASTRUCTURE- RESILIENCE AND PARDONING AND A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS SO THAT THOSE WOULD BE POTENTIALLY NOT APPLICABLE. OBJECTS AND DOES THE L. A. O. HAVE AN OPINION ON BOTH A NEED AND- THE ACTUALLY THE NEED AND THE WORTHINESS OF INVESTING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- OR IN ANY NUMBER REALLY- FOR CALLIAS COMMUNITY RESILIENCE GRANTS SPECIFICALLY TO HELP WITH PS PS- MEDICATION. I I'M SORRY GO HEAD HELEN- THIS IS NINE THIRTY WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE- SO I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HAS BEEN A PRIORITY IN HAD BEEN FOUND IN THE PAST TO THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THERE'S BEEN FUNDING FOR- YOU KNOW FOR THOSE PUBLIC POWER SHUT OFFS- AT THIS POINT THOUGH MY COLLEAGUE I'D PROBABLY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE AND I UNFORTUNATELY HE'S NOT HERE SO WE'LL HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU IF YOU HAVE MORE FURTHER QUESTIONS ON. THAT SPECIFIC PROPOSAL- AND I WILL JUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE CHAIRMAN I HAVE SPOKEN PREVIOUSLY ABOUT THIS AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT IS STILL OPEN AND WE'RE DISCUSSING HERE IN IN THE LEGISLATURE. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU JUST A- COOL I STILL ICED ICE TWO TWO SHORT ONES. AND IN. REGARDS TO- SPECIAL EDUCATION I WANTED TO- I ALSO THINK YOU KNOW BOTH THE LEGISLATURE AND- THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR REALLY ALLOCATING MORE FUNDS THERE I DO HAVE A QUESTION AND I'M NOT SURE- IF YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS AND MAYBE THE CHAIRMAN CAN- CHARTERS SO THERE IS FIVE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE INCLUSIVE EARLY EDUCATION EXPANSION PROGRAM. AND TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE MILLION TO DOUBLE COUNTY SCHOOL DISTRICT KINDERGARTEN ADA AS A PROXY FOR PRESCHOOL ATTENDANCE I'M OUR CHARTER SCHOOLS EXCO EXCLUDED FROM FUNDING AND IF SO- SHOULD WE- ERSTER SCHOOL ACTUALLY EXCLUDED FROM FUNDING FOR TWO K. EXTENSION. TWO WEEKS IS ANYONE HAVE AN ANSWER FOR THAT. MAKING CHRIS FERGUSON FOR THE DEPARTMENT FINANCE CAN HELP WITH THAT ONE. IN GENERAL OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL IS OFFERING KINDERGARTEN TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN IS CONSIDEREDTHE FIRST YEAR OF A TWO YEAR KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM. SO IN GENERAL YES THEY SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN MEDICAID EXPANSION. I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY TK'S BEEN EXISTENCE FOR TEN YEARS FOR KIDS BORN IN THE FALL AND CHARTER SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OFFERING TKA THROUGH THAT COLOR SO THIS WOULD JUST EXPAND. WHAT THEY CURRENTLY DO. OKAY AND THEN LASTLY I JUST I NEED SOME CLARIFICATION- FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- AND THE GOVERNOR'S YOU KNOW MAY REVISE ON YOU KNOW ADDRESSING THE TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS N DEBT THAT THE EIGHTY D. HAS A CURED- WHAT'S THE PLAN I IT'S NOT VERY CLEAR TO ME IN OUR CONVERSATION TONIGHT IN PREVIOUSLY IN TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE A UPWARDS OF TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR- DEBT HERE. AND WE'RE ALLOCATING ANYWHERE BETWEEN A BILLION TO YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD SEVEN BILLION- BUT IT'S TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO WHAT'S THE PLAN BECAUSE THIS IS ONE YEAR BUT TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY. TO BE PAYING BACK OVER SEVERAL YEARS. PRESS CLUB WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO AS YOU NOTED THE IN MINISTRATIONS- PLANNED FOR THE U. I. DEBT WAS TO PICK TO USE ABOUT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IN ARCA. CHIU TO PAY DOWN A PORTION OF THE BALANCE- AND AS YOU NOTED EXPECTED TO BE TWENTY ACCESS TO TWENTY FOUR BILLION AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR- SIMILAR TO- AS OF RIGHT NOW THE APPROACH WITH- AT THIS CURRENT BUDGET WISE TO. USE SOME OF THE FEDERAL DOLLARS TO BUY THAT DOWN- OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS ON THE FUTURE IS ONGOING- BUT AS I WOULD JUST NOTE THAT. BASED ON THAT THE GREAT RECESSION- THE PAY DOWN OF THAT DEBT- WAS- DONE THROUGH THAT GRADUAL INCREASES TO THE- FEDERAL- TAX CREDIT FOR EMPLOYERS TO PAY SO. OVER TIE THAT WOULD BE- BORNE BY I'M INCREASES TO EMPLOYERS SO TAX CHANGES WERE MADE SO IN MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TAXPAYERS BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO FORK OVER THE MONEY OVER THE NEXT YOU KNOW DECADE PLUS. TO PAY DOWN YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED IN THE FIRST PLACE. SO ABSENT IN CORRECT SO ABSENT ANY CHANGES TO THE- THE FINANCING STRUCTURE OF THE U. R. PROGRAM- THOSE ADS. THAT THE RATES WILL BE INCREASING OR THAT THAT CREDITS WOULD BE REDUCED TO EMPLOYERS. AND THEN- THEREBY INCREASING THE TAX THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO PAY TO GO INTO THE- YOU ARE SO THIS IS REALLY DISTRESSING ONE THIS IS AN EXTREMELY DISTURBING TO ME ESPECIALLY WHEN WE LOOK AT. WE HAVE A PROPOSED- TWO HUNDRED BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY AND TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET THIS YEAR LAST YEAR'S BUDGET- WAS HALF OF THIS. AND WHETHER IT IS EASY D. DEBT WHETHER IT IS DEFERRALS- WHETHER IT IS A YOU KNOW A- PENSION LIABILITIES WHETHER IT IS LOOMING FINANCIAL CRISIS THAT ARE- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE GONNA BE FACING ARE FACING- WE SHOULD BE USING THIS AS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BECOME FINANCIALLY SOLVENT THIS IS A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S REALLY UPSETTING THAT WERE NOT BEING FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE THANK YOU- I WOULD JUST. RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU JUST STATED- THE STATE IT IS IN A STRONGER. FINANCIAL CONDITION AS IT'S BEEN IN THE- ALMOST NINE YEARS I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE- AGAIN WE POINT TO THE TWENTY OF THE RECORD- NUMBER AMOUNT OF RESERVES TWENTY FIVE BILLION. IN TERMS OF THE U. I. TAX THE STRUCTURE. OF THE TAX REMAINS IN TERMS OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE TAX REMAINS WHICH IS. IS A TAX THAT IS PAID. BY EMPLOYERS FOR. THEIR EMPLOYEES WHEN THEY ARE UNEMPLOYEDAND THAT IS WHAT THE TAXES AND THAT IS WHAT- REMAIN SO IT IS UP TO US IF WE WANT TO DEBATE THE- PURPOSE OF THE TAXES WAS THE USE OF THE TAX FOR THE FUTURE. BUT I THINK THE FISCAL FACTS REMAIN THAT THE STATE IS IN A STRONGER FINANCIAL POSITION AS IT'S BEEN IN A VERY LONG TIME WHEN I GO TO THE DOCTOR WOULDN'T MISTER LACK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THIS BUDGET EITHER SO MUCH TO BE HAPPY ABOUT AND- AND THE COLLECTIVE WORK OF THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEES AND- I KNOW THE SENATE ON THE OTHER SIDE AS WELL. IT'S GREAT TO SEE US IN AGREEMENT HERE ON ON THIS I PARTICULARLY WANT TO. BE SAY HOW THANKFUL I AM TO SEE THE MONEY FOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL AS WE MOVE FORWARD- ALSO- THRILLED TO SEE FUNDING FOR A BILL THAT I PASSED A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO. AROUND HOME HARDENING AS WE ENTER WILDFIRE SEASON HERE- IT SOMETIMES THESE THINGS TAKE AWHILE WAITED A COUPLE YEARS FOR THAT AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN SEE PROGRESS. PROGRESS THERE. I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY A COUPLE OF THINGS THAT. AROUND JUST JUST RESOURCES IN GENERAL AND AS I THINK ABOUT THIS THIS IS. THIS IS PROBABLY A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY FOR US WITH THESE KINDS OF RESOURCES WERE SEEN NOW. AT CERTAINLY A ONCE IN A LIFETIME OPPORTUNITY FOR THOSE OF US WHILE WE'RE HERE- IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND I REFLECT THAT- I HOPE AND I KNOW THAT THIS LEGISLATURE. IN OUR OVERSIGHT ROLE WILL REALLY. TRY TO PUSH FOR THIS. BUT SOMETIMES JUST HAVING A LOT OF MONEY AND PUSHING IT OUT INTO PROGRAMS ISN'T GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS AND- I BELIEVE THAT- THERE ARE A LOT OF- SILOS IN GOVERNMENT. THERE'S A LOT OF LACK OF COORDINATION AND ESPECIALLY AND I'VE I KNOW I'VE BROUGHT THIS UP ON THE FLOOR MAYBE YESTERDAY OR OR FRIDAY. JUST THE CHALLENGES AROUND HOW WE DEAL WITH HOMELESSNESS THERE'S SO MANY FACES OF HOMELESSNESS OR SO MANY. CAUSES OF HOMELESSNESS. AND THERE DOESN'T FEEL LIKE THERE'S A LOT OF COORDINATION- AND SO THIS IS- THIS IS KIND OF A PLEA FOR THAT- AND I KNOW THAT IN WE ALSO SEE A LOT OF DUPLICATION. WELL A LOT BUT MAYBE THAT'S MAYBE THAT'S A STRETCH THERE IS DEFINITELY DUPLICATION OF THINGS IN. STATE GOVERNMENT WE FOUND THAT IN TO OUR AUDITING PROCESS WORK ONE DEPARTMENT DOESN'T REALIZE THE OTHER DEPARTMENT IS DOING THE SAME THING. AND THEY'RE NOT TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER. SO THAT'S WASTE. THAT'S WAYS THEY CAN BE AVOIDED SO I HOPE WITH THIS UNPRECEDENTED AMOUNT OF RESOURCES GOING IN. TO PROVIDE SOME REALLY VALUABLE SERVICES THAT IS COORDINATED. THAT THERE'S ACCOUNTABILITY. AND THAT WE GET IT RIGHT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU WERE GOING TO MISTER LUCKY AND THEN TO MISTER MATHIS. WELL THANK YOU I DON'T HAVE. ANY OF BURNING QUITE WELL I HAVE SEVERAL BURNING QUESTIONS BUT I'M NOT GOING TO BE LABOR THEM AT THIS POINT I DID WANT TO MAKE IT. A COMMENT THAT- TO THIS POINT OUR BUDGET PROCESSES HAD VIGOROUS DISCUSSIONS AND EXCHANGE OF PERSPECTIVES HAS BEEN SOMETHING I'M VERY VERY PROUD TO HAVE PARTICIPATED IN. IT IS AN HONOR TO WITNESS THIS LEVEL OF LEADERSHIP AS WELL BY. BOTH THE STRUCTURES AND I PARTICIPATED IN BOTH AND SUB BOARDS OF FIVE. HOWEVER IN. THIS PART OF THE PROCESS I'D SAY WERE. SOMEWHERE AROUND HALF TIME- AS WELL AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY THIS IS STILL VERY EARLY. AND IN THE DECISION MAKING TREE AND THERE'S BEEN HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS OF REVIEW. A PERSPECTIVE SHARED. AND I FEEL LIKE IN YEARS PAST. THIS PARTY FROM THIS POINT BACK IS SOMETHING TO BE VERY PROUD OF WHAT WHAT HAPPENS FROM THIS POINT FORWARD. AS A IT SEEMS LIKE. THE PROCESS AND INFORMATION BECOMES WAY MORE GUARDED. AND LESS OPENLY SHARED AND LESSENING GAUGING AND I DON'T WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH CONTROL OVER THAT BUT IT IS A OF RUSTRATION FOR ME THE SO MUCH WORK GETS PUT IN. TO OUR ENGAGEMENT AND ITS ROBUSTNESS NOT BE VERY PROUD OF AND THEN A LOT OF IT JUST KIND OF GOES UP AND- SMOKE FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM AND- IT'S A- IT'S A STRONG FRUSTRATION OF MINE AND I JUST WANTED TO. EXPRESS IT BECAUSE IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER. BUT IT BUT IT IT REALLY IS A FRUSTRATION. I WOULD SAY BURKE YOUR IT'S A VERY IT'S A VERY FAIR POINT AND I WOULD SAY- WITH- THE SIZE OF THE BUDGET THAT WE HAVE THE SIZE OF THE STATE WHAT WE HAVE IN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE. INVOLVED THAT GO INTO DISCUSSING DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE MINUTIA I THINK YOUR YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN I THINK WE DO TRY TO MAKE IT- AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE. BUT AT THIS POINT- THERE ARE DECISIONS THAT DO NEED TO BE MADE. AND I HAVE A GOOD IDEA TO UNDERSTAND I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE YOUR FRUSTRATION I THINK WE DO TRY TO BALANCE THAT. TRANSPARENCY IN THE VERY DEMOCRATIC PROCESS BUT AT THE SAME TIME TO NOT BE PARALYZED BY IT AND TO BE ABLE TO- MAKE SOME FINAL DECISIONS BUT I THINK YOUR POINT IS WELL TAKEN.
