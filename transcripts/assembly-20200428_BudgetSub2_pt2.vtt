00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.367
ADDITIONALLY THAT DOESN'T

00:40:36.433 --> 00:40:37.635
INDICATE WHETHER THOSE WORKING

A THE STATE INCOME. ECHO BUT

01:03:23.065 --> 01:03:24.767
NINETEEN BROUGHT TO LIGHT. WE

01:03:24.834 --> 01:03:26.369
ARE SO GRATEFUL TO THE EARLY

01:03:26.435 --> 01:03:27.270
LEARNING CARE DIVISION

01:03:27.336 --> 01:03:29.472
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.473
THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:33.075
THEIR GUIDANCE AND PROMISE AND

01:03:33.142 --> 01:03:35.444
HOPE OF FINDING REALLY GOT US

01:03:35.511 --> 01:03:36.279
THROUGH THIS VERY DIFFICULT

01:03:36.345 --> 01:03:38.381
TIME. BUT LOOKING AHEAD RE

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:39.549
OPENING SLOWLY IS GOING TO BE A

01:03:39.615 --> 01:03:42.785
CHALLENGE WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.086
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW AND FOR WHAT

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:46.022
IS WITH NOT WAS NOT WITHIN OUR

01:03:46.088 --> 01:03:48.124
CONTROL. I'LL COMMENT QUICKLY

01:03:48.191 --> 01:03:49.659
ON THREE THINGS FIRST OF ALL WE

01:03:49.725 --> 01:03:51.861
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT FACILITIES

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:54.096
SUPPLIES. WE WILL NEED FUNDING

01:03:54.163 --> 01:03:56.399
TO MAKE OUR SPACES AVAILABLE TO

01:03:56.465 --> 01:03:57.433
HAVE CHILDREN PHYSICALLY

01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.701
DISTANT AS THE GOVERNOR TALKED

01:03:58.768 --> 01:04:02.471
ABOUT IN HIS- UPDATE TODAY. WE

01:04:02.538 --> 01:04:03.372
DON'T KNOW IF WE NEED MORE

01:04:03.439 --> 01:04:05.141
CLASSROOMS FOR EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:04:05.208 --> 01:04:07.276
SPACES AND WE DON'T KNOW IF THE

01:04:07.343 --> 01:04:09.545
K. TWELVE WORLD WILL NEED OUR

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:10.746
SPACES SO THAT THEY CAN

01:04:10.813 --> 01:04:12.114
PHYSICALLY DISTANT. WHAT WE

01:04:12.181 --> 01:04:13.516
KNOW FOR SURE IS THAT WE WILL

01:04:13.583 --> 01:04:14.817
NOT HAVE ENOUGH SPACES IF WE

01:04:14.884 --> 01:04:16.552
DON'T FULLY ENGAGE IN SUPPORT

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:18.788
THE ENTIRE MIX DELIVERY AND THE

01:04:18.854 --> 01:04:20.189
CHILD CARE SYSTEM. WE NEED ZIP

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.592
TIES AS THE LCD AND DOCTOR ONLY

01:04:22.658 --> 01:04:24.727

01:04:24.794 --> 01:04:26.762
HELP SOME. PROVIDERS TO BE ABLE

01:04:26.829 --> 01:04:29.265
TO OPEN. SECOND OF ALL I HAVE

01:04:29.332 --> 01:04:30.399
TO POINT OUT IS A COUNTY OFFICE

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:31.601
OF EDUCATION. THE SCHOOL

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.569
READINESS STILL MATTERS. AND IT

01:04:33.636 --> 01:04:34.904
SEEMS THE CONVERSATION ABOUT

01:04:34.971 --> 01:04:36.372
HIGH QUALITY CARE. SCHOOL

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:37.306

CORONAVIRUS OUR CENTERS IN

01:17:51.133 --> 01:17:53.435
PROVIDERS WILL GO AWAY AND

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.604
NEVER COME BACK SO- THE

01:17:55.670 --> 01:17:56.872
QUESTION WE HAVE TO ASK

01:17:56.938 --> 01:17:58.673
OURSELVES IS NOT JUST HOW DO WE

01:17:58.740 --> 01:18:00.942
GROW. EASY TO MAKE SURE IT'S

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:02.444
YOU KNOW UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE

01:18:02.511 --> 01:18:03.845
CALIFORNIA BUT HOW DO WE KEEP

01:18:03.912 --> 01:18:05.914
THE ONES THAT THE PROGRAMS WE

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:08.617
HAVE. OPEN SO THE QUESTION IS

01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:10.385
WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO RE OPEN

01:18:10.452 --> 01:18:13.855
OUR CENTERS. AND INTO MORE

01:18:13.922 --> 01:18:16.224
POORLY TODAY TO CONTINUE TO

01:18:16.291 --> 01:18:18.293
SUPPORT. THEIR FINANCIAL

01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:24.800
SOLVENCY. SIR THIS ISN'T- ANY

01:18:24.866 --> 01:18:26.802
ISSUES THAT. ALL OF A SUDDEN

01:18:26.868 --> 01:18:28.103
OCCURRED BECAUSE O THE

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:29.071
PANDEMIC WE'VE BEEN LOSING

01:18:29.137 --> 01:18:30.439
CHILD CARE FAMILY CHILD CARE

01:18:30.505 --> 01:18:32.441
PROVIDERS FOR THE LAST TEN

01:18:32.507 --> 01:18:35.710
YEARS. BECAUSE THE COSTS. OF

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:38.747
PROVIDING THE CARE AND- HAVE

01:18:38.814 --> 01:18:41.516
NOT KEPT UP. WITH WHAT THEY CAN

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.718
RECEIVE EITHER PAYMENTS FROM US

01:18:43.785 --> 01:18:46.788
OR PAYMENTS FROM FAMILIES. AND

01:18:46.855 --> 01:18:48.857
IT HAS BECOME MORE AND MORE

01:18:48.924 --> 01:18:49.825
DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO MAKE ENDS

01:18:49.891 --> 01:18:52.994
MEET- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:54.429
OCCURS TO ME IS THAT WE PAY

01:18:54.496 --> 01:18:56.631
BASED ON THE REGIONAL MARKET

01:18:56.698 --> 01:18:58.100
RATE IN IN OUR ALTERNATIVE

01:18:58.166 --> 01:18:59.835
PAYMENT PROGRAMS INTERCEPT

01:18:59.901 --> 01:19:02.337
PROGRAMS. IN YET THAT ARE WE

01:19:02.404 --> 01:19:04.673
THE MARKET IT IS A SURVEY

01:19:04.739 --> 01:19:07.042
THAT'S DONE TWO YEARS PRIOR TO

01:19:07.109 --> 01:19:09.678
WHATEVER IS GOING ON IN THIS

01:19:09.744 --> 01:19:12.614
YEAR SO. YOU'RE ALWAYS BEHIND

01:19:12.681 --> 01:19:13.448
THE EIGHT BALL AND THEN YOU GET

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:15.550
APPROVED IMAGE OF THE MARKET

01:19:15.617 --> 01:19:19.121
YOU DON'T GET ALL OF. IT RATES.

01:19:19.187 --> 01:19:20.856
IF I A IT HARD A LOT OF. THAT

01:19:20.922 --> 01:19:21.723
ARE WILLING TO TAKE A- AND IN

01:19:21.790 --> 01:19:23.592
PARTICULAR BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT

01:19:23.658 --> 01:19:24.693
GETTING REIMBURSED FOR THEIR

01:19:24.759 --> 01:19:26.928
ACTUAL COSTS SO THERE WAS A

01:19:26.995 --> 01:19:28.797
COST OF LIVING PIECE BUILT INTO

01:19:28.864 --> 01:19:30.298
THE ARM ARE THAT WOULD BRING IT

01:19:30.365 --> 01:19:31.533
UP TO CURRENT. AND BY THE WAY

01:19:31.600 --> 01:19:33.435
IT DOESN'T BE KEPT UP AND WHAT

01:19:33.502 --> 01:19:35.203
GETS BUDGET EVERY YEAR TO IT

01:19:35.270 --> 01:19:36.771
SEEMS SOME YEARS WE GET IT

01:19:36.838 --> 01:19:39.141
CURRENT. MEANING TWO YEARS LATE

01:19:39.207 --> 01:19:41.443
FOR SOME YEARS IT'S EVEN MORE-

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.145
LATE THE NET THAT'S ONE ISSUE%

01:19:43.211 --> 01:19:46.848
THE SECOND ISSUE IS THAT. THE

01:19:46.915 --> 01:19:49.017
ONE OF PROVIDERS THAT WE HAVE

01:19:49.084 --> 01:19:52.654
ARE GETTING OLDER IT'S- WE HAVE

01:19:52.721 --> 01:19:54.189
QUITE A NUMBER OF IN THERE OVER

01:19:54.256 --> 01:19:55.657
THE AGE OF SIXTY AND MANY OF

01:19:55.724 --> 01:19:56.725
THEM OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY

01:19:56.791 --> 01:19:58.426
FIVE. WILL BEEN DOING THIS FOR

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:00.162
A VERY LONG TIME. HAVE BEEN

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:01.429
TAKING IT VERY WELL FOR A VERY

01:20:01.496 --> 01:20:04.499
LONG TIME BUT BETWEEN. I'M NOT

01:20:04.566 --> 01:20:07.002
GETTING ENOUGH MONEY. AND THEIR

01:20:07.068 --> 01:20:07.869
WEIGHT IS NOT BEING

01:20:07.936 --> 01:20:08.970
COMMENSURATE WITH WHAT THEY CAN

01:20:09.037 --> 01:20:11.339
DO OTHER WHAT OTHER WAYS. AND

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:13.942
MINIMUM WAGE REQUIREMENTS ARE.

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:15.577
AND ALL SORTS OF THINGS THAT

01:20:15.644 --> 01:20:17.646
MAKE IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR THEM

01:20:17.712 --> 01:20:19.281
TO MAKE A LIVING. ARE THERE

01:20:19.347 --> 01:20:21.783
THERE'RE RETIRING AND THEIR NOT

01:20:21.850 --> 01:20:24.085

01:20:24.152 --> 01:20:25.820
OF THE THINGS WE HAVE TO LOOK

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:27.322

BUDGET PICTURE- WHERE WE ARE

DISSIPATING- LESS RESOURCES

01:26:26.481 --> 01:26:27.682
OPPOSED TO ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

01:26:27.749 --> 01:26:29.350

CONTEMPLATING YOU KNOW WHAT

01:26:37.058 --> 01:26:38.259
WHAT THAT TYPE OF THE STRUCTURE

01:26:38.326 --> 01:26:40.595
COULD LOOK LIKE- CERTAINLY OUR

01:26:40.662 --> 01:26:42.297
EXISTING RIGHT STRUCTURE WAS

01:26:42.363 --> 01:26:43.998
NOT- DEVELOPED WITH. SMALLER

01:26:44.065 --> 01:26:46.568
RATIOS IN MIND- SO THAT

01:26:46.634 --> 01:26:47.869
SOMETHING CERTAINLY THAT I

01:26:47.936 --> 01:26:50.405
THINK WE WILL END UP HAVING-

01:26:50.471 --> 01:26:54.208
I'M SOME PRETTY YEAH- LONG

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.276

01:27:14.062 --> 01:27:15.496
THERE ARE. ESSENTIAL WORKERS

01:27:15.563 --> 01:27:16.998
THAT ARE BEYOND THAT TRUE

01:27:17.065 --> 01:27:19.167
DEFINITION OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND

01:27:19.233 --> 01:27:21.102

FARMWORKERS YOU KNOW THERE'S A

01:27:30.411 --> 01:27:33.314
LOT OF. THE CENTRAL WORKERS WHO

01:27:33.381 --> 01:27:35.783
ARE LEFT OUT OF THIS AND SO- I

01:27:35.850 --> 01:27:36.751
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:38.119
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE YOU

01:27:39.821 --> 01:27:41.856
ALL ABOUT DOLLARS AND CENTS AND

SO. WE HAVE THESE MONEY CAME IN

01:27:43.791 --> 01:27:47.128
THROUGH THE ALLOCATION AND

01:27:47.195 --> 01:27:48.062
THEY'RE BEING HELD BACK SO ARE

01:27:48.129 --> 01:27:49.030
YOU ARE YOU ESSENTIALLY HOLDING

01:27:49.097 --> 01:27:51.566
THE BACK. TO COVER THE HOLE

01:27:51.633 --> 01:27:54.168
THAT YOU THINK THAT WE MAY FACE

01:27:54.235 --> 01:27:56.170
THAT OUR CHILD CARE. BUDGET IN

01:27:56.237 --> 01:28:00.041
CALIFORNIA OR IS IT POTENTIAL

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.409
TO USE THOSE MONIES NOW TO

01:28:01.476 --> 01:28:03.611
SERVE THE SENSOR WORKERS THAT

01:28:03.678 --> 01:28:08.116
NEED HELP TODAY. SO I WOULD

01:28:08.182 --> 01:28:10.952
NOT- NECESSARILY AGREE WITH

01:28:11.019 --> 01:28:12.320
THAT IDEA THAT WERE HOLDING

THESE FUNDS BACK- WE NEED TO-

01:28:16.524 --> 01:28:17.925
PUT TOGETHER. SENATE SHOULD BE

01:28:17.992 --> 01:28:20.595
SPENT AND WE NEED TO GET THE

01:28:20.662 --> 01:28:22.597
WORD THE- INSURANCE ALREADY

01:28:22.664 --> 01:28:24.165

AS WELL- I THINK THAT WE SEE

01:28:25.500 --> 01:28:26.834
THAT POTENTIALLY HAPPENING TO

01:28:26.901 --> 01:28:28.469
ME REVISION- BUT THERE ARE

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:29.737
OTHER AVENUES AS WELL SO IT'S

01:28:29.804 --> 01:28:32.473
NOT JUST A SIMPLE AS- WE IN THE

01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.542
FENCED ANNOUNCE OUR ALLOCATION

01:28:34.609 --> 01:28:37.879
IN THE MONEY STARTS LOW- SO. NO

01:28:37.945 --> 01:28:39.480

THOSE KINDS IDENTIFYING WHICH

01:28:55.229 --> 01:28:56.597
OF THOSE NEEDS WE CAN USE THEM

01:28:56.664 --> 01:28:58.299

SOMETHING THAT WE DEATH. GOING

01:29:12.980 --> 01:29:14.482
WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON SHARKS

01:29:14.549 --> 01:29:15.450
I CAN RESPECT ANSWERS SO LET ME

01:29:17.518 --> 01:29:19.487
IT AGAIN IN A DIFFERENT WAY-

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:21.389
ARE WE LOOKING TO USE THOSE

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:22.957
FEDERAL MONIES TO EXPAND

01:29:23.024 --> 01:29:25.259
ACCESS- TO CONTINUE ACCESS

01:29:25.326 --> 01:29:26.527
BECAUSE THAT'S ALWAYS THE

01:29:26.594 --> 01:29:28.730
QUESTION WE HAVE. AFINITE

01:29:28.796 --> 01:29:30.765
NUMBER OF SLOTS AND IN THIS

01:29:30.832 --> 01:29:32.500
DIFFICULT SITUATION SOMETIMES

01:29:32.567 --> 01:29:34.969
WILL BE FIGHTING JUST TO HOLD

01:29:35.036 --> 01:29:37.305
ON TO WHAT WE GOT BUT IN THIS

01:29:37.371 --> 01:29:38.773
CURRENT PANDEMIC COME

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.842
OVERSEEING fNTED

01:29:40.908 --> 01:29:41.776
ON A DAILY BASIS WITH THE

01:29:41.843 --> 01:29:42.710
GOVERNOR TALKED ABOUT TWO HOURS

01:29:42.777 --> 01:29:45.079
AGO CHANGE THINGS IN A MONTH

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.715
FROM NOW. BUT ARE WE LOOKING AT

01:29:47.782 --> 01:29:49.283
THOSE RESOURCES TO. HOLD ON TO

01:29:49.350 --> 01:29:50.651
WHAT WE HAVE TO THE CURRENT

01:29:50.718 --> 01:29:52.420
ACCESS OR TO EXPAND ACCESS

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:54.255
BECAUSE WE WERE HEARING FROM.

01:29:54.322 --> 01:29:55.223
YOU KNOW MISTER GALLAGHER IS

01:29:55.289 --> 01:29:56.424
NODDING HIS HEAD OVER HERE IN

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:58.359
AND THE AG WORLD AND WE HEARING

01:29:58.426 --> 01:30:00.161
FROM PEOPLE WHO ARE IN THE

01:30:00.228 --> 01:30:03.264
RETAIL WORLD AND- YOU KNOW LOW

01:30:03.331 --> 01:30:04.432
WAGE WORKERS WHO HAVE THAT

01:30:04.499 --> 01:30:06.434
CURRENT. CHILD CARE NEED TODAY

01:30:06.501 --> 01:30:07.735
AND THERE IS SOME SO WORKERS

01:30:07.802 --> 01:30:09.237
TODAY YOU CAN GO OUT ON THE

01:30:09.303 --> 01:30:09.804
STREETS PEOPLE WHO ARE OUT

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.139
THERE YOU KNOW THESE ARE THOSE

01:30:11.205 --> 01:30:14.041
WORKERS AND SO. WE JUST HOW DO

01:30:14.108 --> 01:30:14.642
YOU RECONCILE THESE THESE TWO

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.978
THINGS. SO ONE THING THAT I

01:30:17.044 --> 01:30:18.780
THINK IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE WHEN

01:30:18.846 --> 01:30:19.614
ANSWERING THIS QUESTION IS THAT

01:30:19.680 --> 01:30:21.983
THERE ARE. PARAMETERS AND

01:30:22.049 --> 01:30:24.385
FEDERAL LAW- REGARDING THESE

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:24.952
CARES FUNDS AND HOW THEY'RE

01:30:25.019 --> 01:30:27.388
USED. SO THE STATE. NOT USE

01:30:27.455 --> 01:30:30.224
THESE FUNDS TO- SUPPLANT

01:30:30.291 --> 01:30:33.694
EXISTING- APPROPRIATIONS AS

01:30:33.761 --> 01:30:35.329
GENERAL FUND- OUR STATE OTHER

01:30:35.396 --> 01:30:37.265
STATE FUNDS. FOR CHILDCARE- SO

01:30:37.331 --> 01:30:38.833
THEY HAVE TO BE PROVIDED IN

01:30:38.900 --> 01:30:40.501
ADDITION TO THAT. WE'RE TO

01:30:40.568 --> 01:30:41.602
REIMBURSE THE STATE COSTS

01:30:41.669 --> 01:30:43.938
ASSOCIATED CO THE NINETEEN THAT

01:30:44.005 --> 01:30:46.574
WERE- IN CURRENT. AFTER THAT

01:30:46.641 --> 01:30:48.709
HE- THE STATE OF EMERGENCY WAS

01:30:48.776 --> 01:30:51.746
ANNOUNCED. SO IN TERMS OF WHAT

01:30:51.813 --> 01:30:52.914
THEY'RE NOT WE SEE THESE AS

01:30:52.980 --> 01:30:54.849
LIKE A BLACK FILL FOR EXISTING

01:30:54.916 --> 01:30:57.118
STATE FUNDS. ALLOWABLE AND

01:30:57.185 --> 01:30:58.586
PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL LOST

01:30:58.653 --> 01:31:02.223
SO- THIS WOULD BE IN ADDITION

01:31:02.290 --> 01:31:05.259
TO THAT AND AT MOST AGAIN. I'M

01:31:05.326 --> 01:31:07.028
BE REIMBURSED STATE. ALLOCATE

01:31:07.094 --> 01:31:10.932
FOR CLEANING. OKAY I THAT

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:12.767
THAT'S A THINK SO IF. YEAH SO

01:31:12.834 --> 01:31:14.001
THAT. BASICALLY SAYS WE'RE

01:31:14.068 --> 01:31:16.971
LOOKINGTO EXPAND. NOT SUPPLANT

01:31:17.038 --> 01:31:18.372
WHICH WILL BE CURRENTLY AB I

01:31:18.439 --> 01:31:20.174
THINK THAT'S WHAT WAS WITH THE

01:31:20.241 --> 01:31:22.476
PREFERRED- PAT THIS FOR

01:31:22.543 --> 01:31:25.246
