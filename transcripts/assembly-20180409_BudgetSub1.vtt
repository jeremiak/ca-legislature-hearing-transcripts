00:27:06.125 --> 00:27:10.662 region:rollup2
TWENTY THIRTEEN.

00:27:08.994 --> 00:27:14.533 region:rollup2

FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES

00:27:14.533 --> 00:27:20.172 region:rollup2

TWENTY FIFTEEN.

00:27:33.752 --> 00:27:37.456 region:rollup2
SO WE ALL KNOW THERE BEEN VERY A

00:27:35.287 --> 00:27:40.192 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF IMPORTANT CHANGES

00:27:37.456 --> 00:27:41.927 region:rollup2

THOSE DEVELOPMENTS ARE NOT

00:27:47.866 --> 00:27:53.338 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY REFLECTED IN THE

00:27:49.635 --> 00:27:54.106 region:rollup2
DATA WE SEE AND AS WE MOVE ALONG

00:27:53.338 --> 00:27:54.940 region:rollup2

POPULATIONS ARE UNCHANGED FROM

00:28:27.873 --> 00:28:30.542 region:rollup2
THE LAST TIME THEY WERE DONE

00:28:28.607 --> 00:28:31.877 region:rollup2
THAT USED TWO THOUSAND NINE DATA

00:28:30.542 --> 00:28:33.478 region:rollup2
SO WERE. USING DATA FROM FIVE

00:28:31.877 --> 00:28:35.814 region:rollup2
YEARS LATER.

00:28:33.478 --> 00:28:37.416 region:rollup2
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ONE IN TWENTY

00:28:35.814 --> 00:28:39.818 region:rollup2
FOUR ADULTS THAT'S ABOUT FOUR

00:28:37.416 --> 00:28:41.887 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA.

00:28:39.818 --> 00:28:43.655 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCEDA SERIOUS MENTAL

00:28:41.887 --> 00:28:45.757 region:rollup2
ILLNESS DEFINED AS A DIAGNOSABLE

00:28:43.655 --> 00:28:46.825 region:rollup2
MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL

00:28:45.757 --> 00:28:47.926 region:rollup2
DISORDER RESULTING IN A

00:28:46.825 --> 00:28:49.261 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT THAT

00:28:47.926 --> 00:28:51.363 region:rollup2
INTERFERES WITH OR LIMITS MAJOR

00:28:49.261 --> 00:28:53.532 region:rollup2
LIFE ACTIVITIES.

00:28:51.363 --> 00:28:55.200 region:rollup2
A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE IN THAT

00:28:53.532 --> 00:28:57.469 region:rollup2
TOP STRIPE OF ORANGE ABOUT ONE

00:28:55.200 --> 00:28:58.804 region:rollup2
IN SIX CALIFORNIANS OR FIFTEEN

00:28:57.469 --> 00:29:00.272 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF OUR STATE ADULT

00:28:58.804 --> 00:29:02.174 region:rollup2
POPULATION EXPERIENCED ANY

00:29:00.272 --> 00:29:03.542 region:rollup2
MENTAL ILLNESS. IN OTHER WORDS

00:29:02.174 --> 00:29:05.477 region:rollup2
THEY ALSO HAD A MENTAL

00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:06.511 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL DISORDER

00:29:05.477 --> 00:29:08.347 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF

00:29:06.511 --> 00:29:09.147 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENT SO THIS INCLUDES

00:29:08.347 --> 00:29:11.650 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHOSE MENTAL ILLNESS

00:29:09.147 --> 00:29:13.752 region:rollup2

MILD FUNCTIONAL IMPAIRMENT.

00:29:13.752 --> 00:29:17.422 region:rollup2
AMONG CHILDREN IN THE GREEN

00:29:14.953 --> 00:29:19.491 region:rollup2
FIGURES MORE THAN SEVEN PERCENT

00:29:17.422 --> 00:29:21.126 region:rollup2
OR ONE IN THIRTEEN HAD A SERIOUS

00:29:19.491 --> 00:29:22.561 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE THAT'S A

00:29:21.126 --> 00:29:24.096 region:rollup2
MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL

00:29:22.561 --> 00:29:26.465 region:rollup2
DISORDER THAT SUBSTANTIALLY

00:29:24.096 --> 00:29:28.066 region:rollup2
LIMITS FUNCTIONING. IN FAMILY

00:29:26.465 --> 00:29:30.602 region:rollup2
SCHOOL OR COMMUNITY ACTIVITIES

00:29:28.066 --> 00:29:33.372 region:rollup2
AND THERE IS NO ACQUITTAL AND.

00:29:30.602 --> 00:29:35.540 region:rollup2
CATEGORY FOR CHILDREN OF OF THE

00:29:33.372 --> 00:29:36.174 region:rollup2
ANY MENTAL ILLNESS DISORDER IN

00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.044 region:rollup2
ADULTS AND THAT'S WHY WE DON'T

00:29:36.174 --> 00:29:39.945 region:rollup2
SEE THE. LARGER PERCENTAGE IN

00:29:39.044 --> 00:29:40.679 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND AGAIN AS I SAID

00:29:39.945 --> 00:29:41.246 region:rollup2
THESE NUMBERS ARE ESSENTIALLY

00:29:40.679 --> 00:29:44.616 region:rollup2
UNCHANGED FROM TWO THOUSAND

00:29:41.246 --> 00:29:45.384 region:rollup2
NINE.

00:29:44.616 --> 00:29:46.885 region:rollup2
SO I NOW WANT TO DIG INTO A

00:29:45.384 --> 00:29:48.887 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT THE VARIATION THAT WE

00:29:46.885 --> 00:29:49.488 region:rollup2
SEE ACROSS THE STATE.

00:29:48.887 --> 00:29:50.856 region:rollup2
THE FIRST SLIDE SHOWS US SOME

00:29:49.488 --> 00:29:52.190 region:rollup2
REGIONAL VARIATION.

00:29:50.856 --> 00:29:53.392 region:rollup2
THE RATE OF SERIOUS EMOTIONAL

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:55.060 region:rollup2
DISTURBANCE AMONG CHILDREN IN

00:29:53.392 --> 00:29:56.962 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA VARY FROM A HIGH OF

00:29:55.060 --> 00:29:58.463 region:rollup2
EIGHT POINT ONE PERCENT SAN

00:29:56.962 --> 00:29:59.865 region:rollup2
JOAQUIN VALLEY. TO A LOW OF

00:29:58.463 --> 00:30:01.033 region:rollup2
SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT IN THE

00:29:59.865 --> 00:30:03.001 region:rollup2
BAY AREA.

00:30:01.033 --> 00:30:05.303 region:rollup2
THOSE OF THE GREEN BARS THOSE

00:30:03.001 --> 00:30:05.871 region:rollup2
ARE CHILDREN THERE AND THE

00:30:05.303 --> 00:30:06.138 region:rollup2
AVERAGE AGAIN IS ABOUT SEVEN

00:30:05.871 --> 00:30:06.772 region:rollup2
POINT SIX

00:30:06.138 --> 00:30:08.240 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:30:06.772 --> 00:30:09.975 region:rollup2
AMONG ADULTS THE PREVALENCE OF

00:30:08.240 --> 00:30:11.910 region:rollup2
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:30:09.975 --> 00:30:13.378 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE ORANGE BARS RANGED

00:30:11.910 --> 00:30:15.414 region:rollup2
FROM A HIGH OF FIVE POINT FOUR

00:30:13.378 --> 00:30:17.683 region:rollup2
PERCENT IN THE NORTHERN SIERRA

00:30:15.414 --> 00:30:18.984 region:rollup2
REGION. TO A LOW OF THREE POINT

00:30:17.683 --> 00:30:21.586 region:rollup2
FOUR PERCENT IN THE GREATER BAY

00:30:18.984 --> 00:30:21.987 region:rollup2
AREA BAY AREA.

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:22.821 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO THAT.

00:30:21.987 --> 00:30:23.488 region:rollup2
.

00:30:22.821 --> 00:30:24.523 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALSO VARIABILITY WHICH I

00:30:23.488 --> 00:30:27.292 region:rollup2
DIDN'T INCLUDE ON THE SLIDE BY

00:30:24.523 --> 00:30:28.593 region:rollup2
GENDER AND BY AGE SO WOMEN A

00:30:27.292 --> 00:30:30.228 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA WOMEN WERE MORE

00:30:28.593 --> 00:30:31.330 region:rollup2
LIKELY THAN MEN TO EXPERIENCE

00:30:30.228 --> 00:30:33.231 region:rollup2
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AT A RATE

00:30:31.330 --> 00:30:35.400 region:rollup2
OF FOUR POINT EIGHT PERCENT

00:30:33.231 --> 00:30:37.369 region:rollup2
VERSUS THREE POINT SIX PERCENT.

00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:39.738 region:rollup2
AND THE AGE RANGE SHOWS A.

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:41.273 region:rollup2
A SORT OF A.

00:30:39.738 --> 00:30:42.941 region:rollup2
A STANDARD DISTRIBUTION WITH

00:30:41.273 --> 00:30:45.177 region:rollup2
LOWER RATES IN THE YOUNGEST VERY

00:30:42.941 --> 00:30:46.578 region:rollup2
YOUNGEST ADULT AGE GROUPS AND

00:30:45.177 --> 00:30:48.180 region:rollup2
ALSO THE OLDEST TO DATE DULLED

00:30:46.578 --> 00:30:49.481 region:rollup2
AGE GROUPS ON THE PEAK IN THE.

00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:51.817 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE TO FORTY FOUR AGE

00:30:49.481 --> 00:30:53.752 region:rollup2
GROUP.

00:30:51.817 --> 00:30:55.454 region:rollup2
PREVALENCE VARIES BY RACE AND

00:30:53.752 --> 00:30:57.789 region:rollup2
ETHNICITY AS WELL YOU'LL SEE A

00:30:55.454 --> 00:30:59.491 region:rollup2
MUCH GREATER OF DIFFERENCE AMONG

00:30:57.789 --> 00:31:02.027 region:rollup2
ADULTS ON THE RIGHT HAND.

00:30:59.491 --> 00:31:02.394 region:rollup2
CHART THAN AMONG CHILDREN.

00:31:02.027 --> 00:31:04.463 region:rollup2
THE.

00:31:02.394 --> 00:31:05.864 region:rollup2
IT'S TRUE THOUGH THE CHILDREN

00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:08.133 region:rollup2
YOU DO SEE SOME DIFFERENTIAL

00:31:05.864 --> 00:31:09.534 region:rollup2
WITH. LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:31:08.133 --> 00:31:11.903 region:rollup2
NATIVE AMERICAN AND PACIFIC

00:31:09.534 --> 00:31:12.871 region:rollup2
ISLANDER CHILDREN OF HAVING

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:14.639 region:rollup2
RATES OF SERIOUS EMOTIONAL

00:31:12.871 --> 00:31:15.707 region:rollup2
DISTURBANCE CLOSER TO EIGHT

00:31:14.639 --> 00:31:18.043 region:rollup2
PERCENT WITH.

00:31:15.707 --> 00:31:18.543 region:rollup2
WHITE ASIAN AND MULTI RACIAL

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:19.077 region:rollup2
CHILDREN CLOSER TO SEVEN

00:31:18.543 --> 00:31:20.245 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

00:31:19.077 --> 00:31:21.446 region:rollup2
FOR ADULTS AS I SAID

00:31:20.245 --> 00:31:23.381 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER

00:31:21.446 --> 00:31:24.583 region:rollup2
VARIABILITY NATIVE AMERICAN

00:31:23.381 --> 00:31:26.218 region:rollup2
AFRICAN AMERICAN AND MULTI

00:31:24.583 --> 00:31:28.019 region:rollup2
RACIAL ADULTS HAVE THE HIGHEST

00:31:26.218 --> 00:31:29.354 region:rollup2
RATES OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:30.922 region:rollup2
ASIANS AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS THE

00:31:29.354 --> 00:31:32.324 region:rollup2
LOWEST RATES

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:34.559 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THESE NUMBERS ARE

00:31:32.324 --> 00:31:35.994 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM TWO

00:31:34.559 --> 00:31:37.929 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NINE DATA SO WE HAVE

00:31:35.994 --> 00:31:40.198 region:rollup2
SEEN THESE BEFORE AND WE.

00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:41.800 region:rollup2
WE DON'T SEE MUCH DIFFERENCE.

00:31:40.198 --> 00:31:43.502 region:rollup2
LAST SLIDE ON PREVALENCE ON

00:31:41.800 --> 00:31:44.603 region:rollup2
QUICKLY IS BY INCOME.

00:31:43.502 --> 00:31:47.239 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN THIS LOOKS VERY

00:31:44.603 --> 00:31:49.374 region:rollup2
SIMILAR FOR ADULTS IN ORANGE AND

00:31:47.239 --> 00:31:51.309 region:rollup2
CHILDREN IN GREEN IT'S IS FAR

00:31:49.374 --> 00:31:53.445 region:rollup2
MORE COMMON TO SEE SERIOUS

00:31:51.309 --> 00:31:54.446 region:rollup2
MENTAL ILLNESS IN ADULTS SERIOUS

00:31:53.445 --> 00:31:56.748 region:rollup2
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE IN

00:31:54.446 --> 00:31:58.350 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. ARM AMONG PEOPLE AT

00:31:56.748 --> 00:31:59.551 region:rollup2
THE LOWEST INCOME LEVELS UNDER A

00:31:58.350 --> 00:32:03.522 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL

00:31:59.551 --> 00:32:05.390 region:rollup2
POVERTY LEVEL.

00:32:03.522 --> 00:32:06.291 region:rollup2
I NOW WANT TO SHIFT FOCUS TO A

00:32:05.390 --> 00:32:07.793 region:rollup2
TOPIC THAT I KNOW IS OF

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:08.994 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR INTEREST TO EVERYONE

00:32:07.793 --> 00:32:10.495 region:rollup2
ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND THAT'S

00:32:08.994 --> 00:32:12.197 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO CARE.

00:32:10.495 --> 00:32:13.231 region:rollup2
THE DATA I'M PRESENTING COMES

00:32:12.197 --> 00:32:14.766 region:rollup2
FROM A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:16.134 region:rollup2
SOURCES SO I DO WANT TO CAUTION

00:32:14.766 --> 00:32:17.736 region:rollup2
THAT NOT EVERYTHING THAT'S

00:32:16.134 --> 00:32:18.904 region:rollup2
PRESENTED HERE CAN BE DIRECTLY

00:32:17.736 --> 00:32:20.338 region:rollup2
COMPARED. FOR INSTANCE ACROSS

00:32:18.904 --> 00:32:21.339 region:rollup2
AGE GROUPS

00:32:20.338 --> 00:32:23.074 region:rollup2
BUT IT IS DIRECTIONALLY.

00:32:21.339 --> 00:32:25.243 region:rollup2
I THINK.

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:26.745 region:rollup2
ALL LINES UP AND WHAT IT SHOWS

00:32:25.243 --> 00:32:28.680 region:rollup2
IS THAT FOR CALIFORNIA'S

00:32:26.745 --> 00:32:31.683 region:rollup2
POPULATION AS A WHOLE THERE ARE

00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:33.985 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AND CONCERNING GAPS

00:32:31.683 --> 00:32:36.254 region:rollup2
IN ACCESS TO CARE. AND THAT BY

00:32:33.985 --> 00:32:36.822 region:rollup2
AND LARGE THAT SITUATION HAS NOT

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:38.089 region:rollup2
IMPROVED SINCE TWO THOUSAND

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:40.659 region:rollup2
NINE.

00:32:38.089 --> 00:32:42.227 region:rollup2
SO THIS LIVE SHOWS THAT ONLY

00:32:40.659 --> 00:32:43.829 region:rollup2
SLIGHTLY MORE THAN A THIRD OF

00:32:42.227 --> 00:32:45.230 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ADULTS THAT'S THE

00:32:43.829 --> 00:32:46.798 region:rollup2
PORTION OF REFLECTED IN BLUE ON

00:32:45.230 --> 00:32:48.533 region:rollup2
THIS CHART.

00:32:46.798 --> 00:32:50.168 region:rollup2
WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS RECEIVED

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:51.369 region:rollup2
TREATMENT OR COUNSELING DURING

00:32:50.168 --> 00:32:52.804 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR YEAR THIS IS A

00:32:51.369 --> 00:32:54.606 region:rollup2
COMPOSITE OF FOUR YEARS OF DATA

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:56.141 region:rollup2
BUT THEY'RE LOOKING BACK A YEAR.

00:32:54.606 --> 00:32:57.175 region:rollup2
THAT'S A HOLLOW LOWER THAN THE

00:32:56.141 --> 00:32:58.577 region:rollup2
NATIONAL RATE WHICH IS ABOUT

00:32:57.175 --> 00:33:00.212 region:rollup2
FORTY THREE PERCENT AND IS ABOUT

00:32:58.577 --> 00:33:02.547 region:rollup2
THE SAME THAT WE SAW IN TWO

00:33:00.212 --> 00:33:04.983 region:rollup2
THOUSAND NINE.

00:33:02.547 --> 00:33:06.618 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SHOWN HERE BUT THERE'S

00:33:04.983 --> 00:33:08.286 region:rollup2
SOME INTERESTING DATA TO THAT'S

00:33:06.618 --> 00:33:10.055 region:rollup2
IN THE ALMANAC OF THE REPORT

00:33:08.286 --> 00:33:11.890 region:rollup2
ITSELF. THAT SHOWS THAT EVEN

00:33:10.055 --> 00:33:13.458 region:rollup2
AMONG THE CALIFORNIA ADULTS WHO

00:33:11.890 --> 00:33:15.193 region:rollup2
REPORTED THAT THEY HAD SOUGHT

00:33:13.458 --> 00:33:17.095 region:rollup2
CARE TREATMENT FOR THEIR MENTAL

00:33:15.193 --> 00:33:17.696 region:rollup2
ILLNESS SEVENTEEN PERCENT

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:19.030 region:rollup2
REPORTED THAT THEY DID NOT GET

00:33:17.696 --> 00:33:20.499 region:rollup2
IT.

00:33:19.030 --> 00:33:23.168 region:rollup2
AND THAT LINES UP WITH.

00:33:20.499 --> 00:33:24.169 region:rollup2
SURVEY DATA THAT WE GOT FROM

00:33:23.168 --> 00:33:25.871 region:rollup2
THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

00:33:24.169 --> 00:33:27.072 region:rollup2
BERKELEY POLL WHICH SIMILARLY

00:33:25.871 --> 00:33:28.940 region:rollup2
FOUND BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY

00:33:27.072 --> 00:33:30.342 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF PEOPLE. SAYING THAT

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.776 region:rollup2
THEY HAD SOUGHT CARE FOR

00:33:30.342 --> 00:33:33.778 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES OR A FAMILY MEMBER

00:33:31.776 --> 00:33:35.347 region:rollup2
FOR A MENTAL HEALTH CONCERN AND

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:36.615 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN UNABLE TO RECEIVE IT.

00:33:35.347 --> 00:33:37.782 region:rollup2
AND THE MOST COMMON COMPLAINTS

00:33:36.615 --> 00:33:39.417 region:rollup2
WITH THAT THEY COULD NOT FIND A

00:33:37.782 --> 00:33:40.919 region:rollup2
COUNSELOR OR A DOCTOR WHO WOULD

00:33:39.417 --> 00:33:43.889 region:rollup2
ACCEPT THEIR INSURANCE OR THEY

00:33:40.919 --> 00:33:46.124 region:rollup2
COULDN'T AFFORD THE COST.

00:33:43.889 --> 00:33:47.492 region:rollup2
NOW WHEN WE LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:48.927 region:rollup2
ADULTS WHO REPORT MAJOR

00:33:47.492 --> 00:33:50.629 region:rollup2
DEPRESSIVE EPISODES VERSUS THE

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:53.498 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS SLIDE WHICH WAS ANY

00:33:50.629 --> 00:33:54.966 region:rollup2
MENTAL ILLNESS. WE SEE US LATE

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:56.201 region:rollup2
WE SEE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER FUND

00:33:54.966 --> 00:33:58.169 region:rollup2
OUTCOME IN THIS CASE ABOUT CHART

00:33:56.201 --> 00:33:59.771 region:rollup2
ON THE RIGHT THE BLUE. IS THE

00:33:58.169 --> 00:34:01.873 region:rollup2
PROPORTION OF ADULTS REPORTING

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:02.574 region:rollup2
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER WHO

00:34:01.873 --> 00:34:04.276 region:rollup2
DID GET TREATMENT.

00:34:02.574 --> 00:34:06.278 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S ABOUT TWO THIRDS.

00:34:04.276 --> 00:34:06.444 region:rollup2
THAT SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER.

00:34:06.278 --> 00:34:09.347 region:rollup2
AND.

00:34:06.444 --> 00:34:11.616 region:rollup2
.

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:12.918 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THOUGH IS NOT

00:34:11.616 --> 00:34:15.153 region:rollup2
WHAT IT SHOULD BE I THINK THE

00:34:12.918 --> 00:34:16.488 region:rollup2
NATIONAL STANDARD FOR THAT IS

00:34:15.153 --> 00:34:18.390 region:rollup2
MORE LIKE SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT

00:34:16.488 --> 00:34:20.058 region:rollup2
SO CALIFORNIA'S STILL BEHIND. IN

00:34:18.390 --> 00:34:21.493 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

00:34:20.058 --> 00:34:22.794 region:rollup2
RECEIVING CARE EVEN FOR A VERY

00:34:21.493 --> 00:34:24.229 region:rollup2
SERIOUS ILLNESS LIKE MAJOR

00:34:22.794 --> 00:34:26.731 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION.

00:34:24.229 --> 00:34:26.932 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS A SLIDE THAT I

00:34:26.731 --> 00:34:28.500 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:34:26.932 --> 00:34:30.001 region:rollup2
IS PROBABLY.

00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:31.369 region:rollup2
THE MOST CONCERNING OF ALL THE

00:34:30.001 --> 00:34:33.405 region:rollup2
NUMBERS EVER IN REPORTING TODAY

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:36.007 region:rollup2
SO THESE ARE ADOLESCENTS.

00:34:33.405 --> 00:34:38.810 region:rollup2
ON THE LEFT HAND SIDE THE

00:34:36.007 --> 00:34:41.246 region:rollup2
ORANGE BAR A CALIFORNIA NUMBERS

00:34:38.810 --> 00:34:43.548 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS THE OF. PROPORTION

00:34:41.246 --> 00:34:45.750 region:rollup2
OF A PERCENTAGE OF ADOLESCENTS

00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:47.052 region:rollup2
WHO REPORT HAVING HAD A MAJOR

00:34:45.750 --> 00:34:48.320 region:rollup2
DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IN THE PAST

00:34:47.052 --> 00:34:48.753 region:rollup2
YEAR.

00:34:48.320 --> 00:34:50.522 region:rollup2
AND.

00:34:48.753 --> 00:34:51.489 region:rollup2
THOSE NUMBERS ARE AMONG THE

00:34:50.522 --> 00:34:53.391 region:rollup2
ONLY ONCE WE SEE THAT HAVE

00:34:51.489 --> 00:34:54.826 region:rollup2
CHANGED FROM TWO THOUSAND NINE

00:34:53.391 --> 00:34:56.561 region:rollup2
AND THEY HAVE NOT CHANGED IN THE

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:58.096 region:rollup2
RIGHT DIRECTION. SO THE NUMBER

00:34:56.561 --> 00:34:59.731 region:rollup2
OF ADOLESCENCE REPORTING MAJOR

00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:01.766 region:rollup2
DEPRESSIVE EPISODE IS UP TO

00:34:59.731 --> 00:35:03.668 region:rollup2
TWELVE POINT THREE PERCENT OR

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.502 region:rollup2
ONE IN EIGHT ADOLESCENTS FIVE

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:06.104 region:rollup2
YEARS AGO.

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:08.039 region:rollup2
IN IN THE.

00:35:06.104 --> 00:35:09.341 region:rollup2
EIGHT OH NINE YEAR THAT WAS

00:35:08.039 --> 00:35:11.443 region:rollup2
EIGHT PERCENT SO THAT'S NEARLY A

00:35:09.341 --> 00:35:12.344 region:rollup2
FIFTY PERCENT INCREASE. IN THE

00:35:11.443 --> 00:35:14.446 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE REPORTING

00:35:12.344 --> 00:35:14.879 region:rollup2
MAJOR I'M DEPRESSIVE EPISODE AND

00:35:14.446 --> 00:35:16.514 region:rollup2
THEN ON THE RIGHT.

00:35:14.879 --> 00:35:17.716 region:rollup2
.

00:35:16.514 --> 00:35:19.150 region:rollup2
THIS IS REALLY THE REVERSE OF

00:35:17.716 --> 00:35:21.186 region:rollup2
THE CHART I JUST SHOWED FOR

00:35:19.150 --> 00:35:23.388 region:rollup2
ADULTS THE GREEN IS THE

00:35:21.186 --> 00:35:24.622 region:rollup2
PROPORTION OF ADOLESCENCE WITH

00:35:23.388 --> 00:35:26.791 region:rollup2
MAJOR DEPRESSIVE EPISODE REPORT

00:35:24.622 --> 00:35:28.760 region:rollup2
HAVING RECEIVED TREATMENT.

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:29.861 region:rollup2
THAT'S ONLY ABOUT A THIRD.

00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:33.765 region:rollup2
AND LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL

00:35:29.861 --> 00:35:34.199 region:rollup2
RATE.

00:35:33.765 --> 00:35:36.301 region:rollup2
JUST WANT TO MAKE.

00:35:34.199 --> 00:35:39.337 region:rollup2
A COUPLE OF COMMENTS ABOUT THE

00:35:36.301 --> 00:35:42.273 region:rollup2
ROLE OF THE PUBLIC SYSTEM.

00:35:39.337 --> 00:35:43.642 region:rollup2
IN PROVIDING CARE IN OF THE

00:35:42.273 --> 00:35:45.577 region:rollup2
AREA OF MENTAL HEALTH SO THE

00:35:43.642 --> 00:35:46.144 region:rollup2
CHART ON THE LEFT IS FOR ALL

00:35:45.577 --> 00:35:47.212 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE AND YOU CAN SEE

00:35:46.144 --> 00:35:49.347 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:35:47.212 --> 00:35:50.882 region:rollup2
THE PURPLE AND THE TEAL.

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:52.717 region:rollup2
BANDS WHICH ARE MEDICAID

00:35:50.882 --> 00:35:54.386 region:rollup2
FUNDING AND OTHER PUBLIC FUNDING

00:35:52.717 --> 00:35:54.986 region:rollup2
AT UP TO ABOUT A THIRD OF ALL

00:35:54.386 --> 00:35:55.854 region:rollup2
FUNDING THAT'S FOR ALL HEALTH

00:35:54.986 --> 00:35:57.722 region:rollup2
CARE.

00:35:55.854 --> 00:35:58.223 region:rollup2
AS COMPARED TO MUCH BIGGER

00:35:57.722 --> 00:35:59.557 region:rollup2
PORTIONS FOR PRIVATE AND

00:35:58.223 --> 00:36:01.993 region:rollup2
MEDICARE.

00:35:59.557 --> 00:36:03.662 region:rollup2
BUT FOR MENTAL HEALTH.

00:36:01.993 --> 00:36:04.229 region:rollup2
MEDICAID AND OTHER PUBLIC

00:36:03.662 --> 00:36:07.165 region:rollup2
DOLLARS MAKEUP OF MORE THAN

00:36:04.229 --> 00:36:08.533 region:rollup2
HALF.

00:36:07.165 --> 00:36:10.068 region:rollup2
OF THE SPENDING ON HEALTH CARE

00:36:08.533 --> 00:36:11.469 region:rollup2
NO THESE ARE NATIONAL NUMBERS

00:36:10.068 --> 00:36:12.470 region:rollup2
NOT CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE

00:36:11.469 --> 00:36:13.972 region:rollup2
THEM FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:36:12.470 --> 00:36:16.007 region:rollup2
BUT WE THINK THAT THAT PROBABLY

00:36:13.972 --> 00:36:17.142 region:rollup2
TRACKS HERE AND IT JUST LEADS

00:36:16.007 --> 00:36:19.010 region:rollup2
I'M.

00:36:17.142 --> 00:36:21.312 region:rollup2
REALLY TO MY FINAL POINT WHICH

00:36:19.010 --> 00:36:24.049 region:rollup2
IS THAT. ARE IN CALIFORNIA THE

00:36:21.312 --> 00:36:25.650 region:rollup2
PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM IS.

00:36:24.049 --> 00:36:27.485 region:rollup2
IS IS OUR MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM

00:36:25.650 --> 00:36:27.852 region:rollup2
SYSTEM BY AND LARGE AND YOU ALL

CONCERNING STATISTICS FOR ME AND

00:38:37.282 --> 00:38:41.653 region:rollup2
A SYMPTOM THAT OUR SYSTEM MAY

PROBABLY NO ONE IN THIS ROOM WHO

00:39:39.577 --> 00:39:44.682 region:rollup2

00:39:41.679 --> 00:39:46.050 region:rollup2
THOSE ISSUES OF MENTAL. HEALTH

THINK.

00:39:55.093 --> 00:39:58.529 region:rollup2
THERE HAS BEEN INCREASED

00:39:56.928 --> 00:40:00.198 region:rollup2
ATTENTION AND THERE IS QUITE A

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:03.067 region:rollup2
BIT OF NEW WORK THAT IS FOCUSING

00:40:00.198 --> 00:40:05.270 region:rollup2
ON PERINATAL DEPRESSION I'M AND

00:40:03.067 --> 00:40:06.738 region:rollup2
ANXIETY. A GENERAL PERINATAL

00:40:05.270 --> 00:40:08.973 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH DISORDERS I THINK

00:40:06.738 --> 00:40:09.774 region:rollup2

IN THE COUNTIES A AND AT THE

00:40:17.048 --> 00:40:19.584 region:rollup2
QUESTION AS WELL. ON THAT IS ONE

00:40:19.183 --> 00:40:22.220 region:rollup2

00:40:23.321 --> 00:40:24.856 region:rollup2
I THINK AND IT'S ANOTHER PLACE

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:26.624 region:rollup2
WHERE IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT

00:40:24.856 --> 00:40:28.259 region:rollup2

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:34.485 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIP AND SOME OF THE

00:42:33.885 --> 00:42:35.620 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WE HAVE DONE IS THE

00:42:34.485 --> 00:42:37.055 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

00:42:35.620 --> 00:42:39.157 region:rollup2
WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

00:42:37.055 --> 00:42:41.025 region:rollup2
THE DELIVERY OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:39.157 --> 00:42:42.360 region:rollup2
SERVICES IN CALIFORNIA ON IT IS

00:42:41.025 --> 00:42:45.263 region:rollup2
A FAIRLY.

00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:46.931 region:rollup2
INTERWOVEN AND TIGHTLY.

00:42:45.263 --> 00:42:48.366 region:rollup2
.

00:42:46.931 --> 00:42:49.934 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED I IMMEDIATELY

00:42:48.366 --> 00:42:50.902 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED DISCUSSION FROM THE

00:42:49.934 --> 00:42:53.037 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT THAT IT'S A STATE

00:42:50.902 --> 00:42:54.705 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT THAT OVERSEES THE

00:42:53.037 --> 00:42:56.407 region:rollup2
DELIVERY OF SYSTEMS THROUGH A

00:42:54.705 --> 00:42:57.942 region:rollup2
COUNTY BASED ORGANIZED SYSTEM

00:42:56.407 --> 00:42:59.477 region:rollup2
AROUND SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

00:42:57.942 --> 00:43:00.645 region:rollup2
BOTH FOR PEDIATRIC AND ADULT

00:42:59.477 --> 00:43:01.813 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS.

00:43:00.645 --> 00:43:04.015 region:rollup2
WE WILL.

00:43:01.813 --> 00:43:06.484 region:rollup2
PROBABLY TO THEY USE THE TERM

00:43:04.015 --> 00:43:07.885 region:rollup2
BRAIDED FUNDING A LOT FROM THE

00:43:06.484 --> 00:43:10.221 region:rollup2
STANDPOINT THAT WHEN COUNTIES

00:43:07.885 --> 00:43:11.022 region:rollup2
ARE DELIVERING SERVICES TO ON

00:43:10.221 --> 00:43:13.391 region:rollup2
EITHER.

00:43:11.022 --> 00:43:15.126 region:rollup2
PEDIATRIC OR ADULT POPULATIONS

00:43:13.391 --> 00:43:17.061 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FUNDING

00:43:15.126 --> 00:43:18.963 region:rollup2
SOURCES THAT THEY CAN USE TO

00:43:17.061 --> 00:43:20.097 region:rollup2
HELP DELIVER THOSE SERVICES ON

00:43:18.963 --> 00:43:22.333 region:rollup2
IN MEDI CAL.

00:43:20.097 --> 00:43:24.368 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY THE FEDERAL FINANCIAL

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:25.803 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:43:24.368 --> 00:43:27.271 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COUNTIES

00:43:25.803 --> 00:43:29.340 region:rollup2
BUT THEY CAN USE.

00:43:27.271 --> 00:43:30.741 region:rollup2
NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT

00:43:29.340 --> 00:43:32.276 region:rollup2
FUNDING THEY CAN USE THEIR

00:43:30.741 --> 00:43:32.977 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SUB ACCOUNT

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:35.480 region:rollup2
THAT WAS.

00:43:32.977 --> 00:43:38.216 region:rollup2
DEDICATED IN TWO THOUSAND

00:43:35.480 --> 00:43:40.885 region:rollup2
ELEVEN THEY CAN USE THEIR MHSAA

00:43:38.216 --> 00:43:42.587 region:rollup2
FUNDING THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT

00:43:40.885 --> 00:43:43.955 region:rollup2
OF FEDERAL SAP DE BLOCK GRANT

00:43:42.587 --> 00:43:44.922 region:rollup2
AND SO WHEN COUNTIES HAVE AN

00:43:43.955 --> 00:43:46.457 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL.

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:49.026 region:rollup2
THAT IS SEEKING TREATMENT

00:43:46.457 --> 00:43:50.027 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON WHO THEY ARE THE

00:43:49.026 --> 00:43:51.129 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT THEY NEED

00:43:50.027 --> 00:43:53.231 region:rollup2
WHATEVER'S MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE

00:43:51.129 --> 00:43:54.966 region:rollup2
THEY CAN USE A VARIETY OF

00:43:53.231 --> 00:43:56.767 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES IF NOT ALL OF

00:43:54.966 --> 00:43:56.901 region:rollup2
THOSE AND SO IT GETS.

00:43:56.767 --> 00:43:57.502 region:rollup2
.

00:43:56.901 --> 00:43:59.470 region:rollup2
PRETTY DIFFICULT SOMETIMES TO

00:43:57.502 --> 00:44:01.405 region:rollup2
KIND OF PULL OUT CERTAIN FUNDING

00:43:59.470 --> 00:44:02.240 region:rollup2
SOURCES AND SAY WELL IS THIS.

00:44:01.405 --> 00:44:04.675 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PARTICULAR WE'RE

00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:05.209 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT MHSAA TODAY ON IT

00:44:04.675 --> 00:44:06.677 region:rollup2
IS ONE FUNDING STREAM THAT

00:44:05.209 --> 00:44:09.614 region:rollup2
HELPS.

00:44:06.677 --> 00:44:10.681 region:rollup2
AUGMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY IS AN

00:44:09.614 --> 00:44:11.816 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FUNDING SOURCE BUT

00:44:10.681 --> 00:44:13.351 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE ONLY FUNDS ARE SO I

00:44:11.816 --> 00:44:14.719 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO KIND OF. LAY THAT

00:44:13.351 --> 00:44:17.121 region:rollup2
OUT BEFORE WE SPEND A LOT OF

00:44:14.719 --> 00:44:18.756 region:rollup2
TIME FOCUS JUST ON THE MHSAA.

00:44:17.121 --> 00:44:21.092 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT THAT.

00:44:18.756 --> 00:44:23.494 region:rollup2
WAS CONDUCTED BY THE CALIFORNIA

STATE AUDITOR I'M YOU KNOW WE.

00:44:23.494 --> 00:44:27.532 region:rollup2
AGREED WITH A NUMBER OF THE

00:44:25.463 --> 00:44:29.167 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THE AUDITOR

00:44:27.532 --> 00:44:30.968 region:rollup2

00:44:29.167 --> 00:44:32.670 region:rollup2
ITEMS THAT WE EITHER DISAGREED

00:44:30.968 --> 00:44:34.138 region:rollup2

00:44:32.670 --> 00:44:35.439 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE HAVE.

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:38.376 region:rollup2
BOTH

00:44:35.439 --> 00:44:40.611 region:rollup2
UNDERTAKEN AND CONTINUE TO SEEK

00:44:38.376 --> 00:44:42.046 region:rollup2
WAYS TO IMPROVE BOTH THE

00:44:40.611 --> 00:44:44.248 region:rollup2
DELIVERY AND USE OF THOSE.

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:46.417 region:rollup2

CLOSELY WITH THE COMMISSION BUT

00:44:48.819 --> 00:44:52.823 region:rollup2
ALSO IN BROAD BRUSH STROKES.

00:44:50.955 --> 00:44:54.425 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE TOTAL

00:44:52.823 --> 00:44:55.893 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF FUNDS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:44:54.425 --> 00:44:58.529 region:rollup2

DIFFERENT SERVICE.

00:45:05.670 --> 00:45:08.339 region:rollup2
BUCKETS.

00:47:54.004 --> 00:47:57.641 region:rollup2
TELL YOU THAT. WE'VE MADE A LOT

00:47:55.606 --> 00:47:59.143 region:rollup2
OF PROGRESS WIN I THINK WE

00:47:57.641 --> 00:48:01.846 region:rollup2
STARTED THIS CONVERSATION. A

00:47:59.143 --> 00:48:02.480 region:rollup2
REPORTS WERE LESS LIKELY TO BE

00:48:01.846 --> 00:48:03.314 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO MUCH MORE AVAILABLE

00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:05.216 region:rollup2
NOW.

00:48:03.314 --> 00:48:07.418 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOT JUST IN THE LAST FEW

00:48:05.216 --> 00:48:08.652 region:rollup2
DAYS RELEASED AN UPDATE WHAT WE

00:48:07.418 --> 00:48:10.054 region:rollup2
CALL A FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL.

00:48:08.652 --> 00:48:12.523 region:rollup2
AND THAT WHEN WE STARTED THIS

00:48:10.054 --> 00:48:14.258 region:rollup2
WORK AND THERE WERE THERE WERE I

00:48:12.523 --> 00:48:15.693 region:rollup2
THINK I THINK ONE COUNTY REPORT

00:48:14.258 --> 00:48:16.861 region:rollup2
FOR THE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL

00:48:15.693 --> 00:48:18.028 region:rollup2
YEAR BUT I THINK WE'RE UP TO

00:48:16.861 --> 00:48:19.730 region:rollup2
ABOUT THIRTY SOMETHING ALONG

00:48:18.028 --> 00:48:21.065 region:rollup2
THOSE LINES. SO THAT THE SPEED

00:48:19.730 --> 00:48:22.299 region:rollup2
WITH WHICH THE COUNTIES ARE

00:48:21.065 --> 00:48:23.734 region:rollup2
RESPONDING IN THE SPEED WITH

00:48:22.299 --> 00:48:25.369 region:rollup2
WHICH THE DEPARTMENT IS ABLE TO

00:48:23.734 --> 00:48:26.070 region:rollup2
MAKE THIS INFORMATION AVAILABLE

00:48:25.369 --> 00:48:28.706 region:rollup2
HAS INCLUDE HAS IMPROVED

00:48:26.070 --> 00:48:30.107 region:rollup2
DRAMATICALLY. IN THE LAST SIX

00:48:28.706 --> 00:48:32.009 region:rollup2
MONTHS I WOULD SAY AND SO I I I

00:48:30.107 --> 00:48:34.512 region:rollup2
THINK. I'M THE COMMISSION HAS

00:48:32.009 --> 00:48:36.947 region:rollup2
BEEN WORKING VERY DILIGENTLY TO

00:48:34.512 --> 00:48:37.882 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO MAKE IT CLEAR WHY THIS

00:48:36.947 --> 00:48:39.517 region:rollup2
IS IMPORTANT.

00:48:37.882 --> 00:48:41.318 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S A MANDATE UNDER THE

00:48:39.517 --> 00:48:42.787 region:rollup2
LAW BUT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IF

00:48:41.318 --> 00:48:43.788 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION IN THE STATE OF

00:48:42.787 --> 00:48:46.190 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE ABLE

00:48:43.788 --> 00:48:46.757 region:rollup2
TO. ESTABLISH THE SYSTEMS OF

00:48:46.190 --> 00:48:48.058 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

00:48:46.757 --> 00:48:49.460 region:rollup2
THAT ARE NECESSARY.

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:51.562 region:rollup2
PART OF THE STRATEGY FOR THE

00:48:49.460 --> 00:48:53.030 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IS THAT IT'S LESS

00:48:51.562 --> 00:48:54.899 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE COMMISSION BEING ABLE

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:56.867 region:rollup2
TO SORT OF PASS JUDGMENT ON THE

00:48:54.899 --> 00:48:58.202 region:rollup2
COUNTIES IN TERMS OF WHO OF WHAT

00:48:56.867 --> 00:48:59.703 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE HAPPENING. AND MORE

00:48:58.202 --> 00:49:01.272 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE DESIGN OF

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:02.406 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT BE ABLE TO ENABLE

00:49:01.272 --> 00:49:03.073 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:04.875 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN THEIR OWN

00:49:03.073 --> 00:49:05.843 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES AND TO PARTICIPATE

00:49:04.875 --> 00:49:07.611 region:rollup2
SO THAT ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE

00:49:05.843 --> 00:49:09.079 region:rollup2
PUBLIC ACCOUNTABILITY.

00:49:07.611 --> 00:49:11.015 region:rollup2
SO I THINK AS YOU SAID YOU SAW

00:49:09.079 --> 00:49:12.149 region:rollup2
ON THE AUDIT. AND DIRECTOR

00:49:11.015 --> 00:49:13.651 region:rollup2
KENNETH APSLEY RIDE THE VAST

00:49:12.149 --> 00:49:15.219 region:rollup2
MAJORITY OF FUNDS HAVE BEEN

00:49:13.651 --> 00:49:16.053 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED IN HAVE BEEN SPENT FOR

00:49:15.219 --> 00:49:17.988 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

00:49:16.053 --> 00:49:20.958 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH HAVING SAID THAT TWO

00:49:17.988 --> 00:49:21.926 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND IN TWENTY HONOR TO

00:49:20.958 --> 00:49:23.527 region:rollup2
COURT NEARLY A QUARTER BILLION

00:49:21.926 --> 00:49:24.094 region:rollup2
DOLLARS UNSPENT FUNDS.

00:49:23.527 --> 00:49:25.095 region:rollup2
ANNA IS A LOT OF MONEY AND

00:49:24.094 --> 00:49:26.297 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUCH TREMENDOUS

00:49:25.095 --> 00:49:28.165 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION ON THE PART OF

00:49:26.297 --> 00:49:29.500 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND PART OF FAMILY

00:49:28.165 --> 00:49:30.835 region:rollup2
MEMBERS AND COMMUNITIES.

00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:32.169 region:rollup2
THE THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE NOT

00:49:30.835 --> 00:49:34.939 region:rollup2
BEING DEPLOYED IN WAYS THAT ARE

00:49:32.169 --> 00:49:34.939 region:rollup2
THAT ARE.

00:49:35.005 --> 00:49:36.774 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WHO ARE IN OUR

00:49:35.472 --> 00:49:38.909 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES.

00:49:36.774 --> 00:49:39.777 region:rollup2
WE ACTUALLY SEE THIS IN TERMS OF

00:49:38.909 --> 00:49:40.678 region:rollup2
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THIS COUNTY

00:49:39.777 --> 00:49:41.846 region:rollup2

SUPERVISORS WHO ARE ASKING US.

TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND ONE OF

00:49:46.517 --> 00:49:49.286 region:rollup2
THE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTIONS.

00:49:48.419 --> 00:49:50.821 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAVE IN YOUR ANALYSIS

00:49:49.286 --> 00:49:52.857 region:rollup2

ABOUT THAT WE WE WE ARE NOT IN

00:49:54.859 --> 00:49:58.229 region:rollup2
THE BEST POSITION TO REALLY.

00:49:56.193 --> 00:50:00.030 region:rollup2
ANSWER THAT QUESTION BUT WE'RE

00:49:58.229 --> 00:50:01.098 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATED AS WELL. THAT THE

WHERE THEY ARE AND AND THAT

00:50:12.243 --> 00:50:13.911 region:rollup2
THEIR DECEMBER DESIGNING

00:50:13.344 --> 00:50:15.546 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT ARE PREVENTION

00:50:13.911 --> 00:50:16.981 region:rollup2

00:50:15.546 --> 00:50:18.382 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE MADE A MAKING

00:50:16.981 --> 00:50:18.983 region:rollup2
TREMENDOUS PROGRESS

00:50:18.382 --> 00:50:20.217 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S AN EQUAL LEVEL OF

00:50:18.983 --> 00:50:20.851 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION.

00:50:20.217 --> 00:50:22.019 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A LONG WAY TO GO AS

00:50:20.851 --> 00:50:25.556 region:rollup2

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:43.607 region:rollup2
ACTUAL SET OF QUESTIONS OUR FOES

00:50:42.039 --> 00:50:47.578 region:rollup2
WERE JUST SORT OF A GUIDE FOR

00:50:43.607 --> 00:50:48.479 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BOY WORLD IF YOU

00:50:47.578 --> 00:50:50.381 region:rollup2
WOULD PREFER TO ADDRESS ISLAND

00:50:48.479 --> 00:50:51.682 region:rollup2

THERE SO ON THE ISSUE OF COUNTY

00:50:51.682 --> 00:50:54.218 region:rollup2
REPORTING I THINK.

00:50:52.116 --> 00:50:55.486 region:rollup2
A LOT OF PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE

00:50:54.218 --> 00:50:57.087 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT.

00:50:55.486 --> 00:50:59.356 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT AND SEE BE HDA

00:50:57.087 --> 00:51:00.824 region:rollup2
ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA

00:50:59.356 --> 00:51:01.959 region:rollup2

FUNDS ALONG WITH THEIR

00:51:03.627 --> 00:51:06.864 region:rollup2

00:51:05.162 --> 00:51:07.665 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT THAT WE'VE

ACKNOWLEDGED THAT THERE HAD BEEN

00:51:07.665 --> 00:51:10.768 region:rollup2
DELAY IS NOT ONLY ON THE PART OF

COUNTY SUBMITTING THEIR REPORTS

00:51:10.768 --> 00:51:12.937 region:rollup2

THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE MOST

00:51:20.678 --> 00:51:25.015 region:rollup2
COMMON REASONS AND I THINK EVEN

00:51:23.314 --> 00:51:27.518 region:rollup2
THE CHART THAT'S ON THE AGENDA

00:51:25.015 --> 00:51:30.387 region:rollup2
AROUND THE FISCAL YEAR SIXTEEN

00:51:27.518 --> 00:51:36.226 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN. ARI OURS REVENUE AND

00:51:30.387 --> 00:51:37.528 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE REPORTS IS A GOOD

00:51:36.226 --> 00:51:38.295 region:rollup2
ILLUSTRATION OF THIS.

00:51:37.528 --> 00:51:38.862 region:rollup2
SO AS YOU NOTE IN YOUR AGENDA

00:51:38.295 --> 00:51:39.897 region:rollup2
EACH YEAR THE COUNTIES ARE

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.431 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO PROVIDE TO THE STATE

00:51:39.897 --> 00:51:40.664 region:rollup2
A REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE

00:51:40.431 --> 00:51:41.732 region:rollup2

DESCRIBING WHAT THEIR PRIOR

00:51:41.732 --> 00:51:45.035 region:rollup2
YEAR AND EXPENDITURES WERE FOR

00:51:43.434 --> 00:51:45.869 region:rollup2
THEM IN A WHOLE SERVICES ACT.

00:51:45.035 --> 00:51:46.737 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S DUE TO THE STOCK TO

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:48.405 region:rollup2
THE STATE BY THE DECEMBER THIRTY

00:51:46.737 --> 00:51:49.006 region:rollup2
FIRST OF EACH YEAR.

00:51:48.405 --> 00:51:49.640 region:rollup2
AND WHILE THERE ARE CERTAINLY

00:51:49.006 --> 00:51:50.207 region:rollup2

YEAR THE DEPARTMENT DOES.

00:51:52.910 --> 00:51:57.114 region:rollup2
AT TIMES TEND TO A REVISED ITS

00:51:55.145 --> 00:51:58.115 region:rollup2

00:51:57.114 --> 00:52:00.384 region:rollup2
REVISE THE FORM.

00:51:58.115 --> 00:52:01.885 region:rollup2
AND IN SOME CASES THAT DOES

00:52:00.384 --> 00:52:03.454 region:rollup2
RESULT IN DELAYS IN TERMS OF

ERRORS WERE NOTED IN THE FORM

00:52:08.926 --> 00:52:12.496 region:rollup2
AND THEN AT AN UPDATED VERSION

00:52:11.095 --> 00:52:14.598 region:rollup2
WAS MADE AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES

00:52:12.496 --> 00:52:15.733 region:rollup2
IN JANUARY A MONTH AFTER THE

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:17.167 region:rollup2
FORM IS ACTUALLY DUE TO THE

00:52:15.733 --> 00:52:19.703 region:rollup2
STATES THAT THERE IS SORT OF A.

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:20.738 region:rollup2
A DOMINO EFFECT THAT HAPPENS IN

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:22.172 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT AND SEE BEACH TO

00:52:20.738 --> 00:52:23.140 region:rollup2
HAVE DISCUSSED THE POSSIBILITY

00:52:22.172 --> 00:52:25.342 region:rollup2
OF A SETTING UP.

00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:27.111 region:rollup2

ME ARE DEADLINE AS WELL.

00:52:38.489 --> 00:52:41.225 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER COMPLICATION

00:52:40.524 --> 00:52:43.160 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

00:52:41.225 --> 00:52:44.495 region:rollup2
AS WAS POINTED OUT BY DIRECTOR

00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:46.263 region:rollup2
CAN'T WE HAVE A VARIETY OF

00:52:44.495 --> 00:52:47.898 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES MANY OF WHICH

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:49.433 region:rollup2
ARE REQUIRED TO BE BLENDED

00:52:47.898 --> 00:52:50.668 region:rollup2
TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE IN A WHOLE

00:52:50.668 --> 00:52:53.837 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO MAXIMIZE THE EXTENT

TO WHICH THEY CAN DRAW DOWN

00:52:53.837 --> 00:53:01.545 region:rollup2
FEDERAL MATIC MEDICAID MATCHING

00:52:59.243 --> 00:53:02.413 region:rollup2

01:00:39.903 --> 01:00:44.241 region:rollup2
BIT OF TIME REALLY DISCUSSING

01:00:41.938 --> 01:00:46.009 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL OVERSIGHT AND WHAT WE

01:00:44.241 --> 01:00:48.278 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT MEANS AS A STATE.

01:00:46.009 --> 01:00:49.946 region:rollup2
WHAT IS OUR ROLE IN INSURING

01:00:48.278 --> 01:00:51.314 region:rollup2
THAT THE COUNTIES HAVE

01:00:49.946 --> 01:00:54.317 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED THESE FUNDS IN A

01:00:51.314 --> 01:00:56.586 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL? EFFECTIVE WAY.

01:00:54.317 --> 01:01:00.824 region:rollup2
AND HOW ARE WE TRACKING TO MAKE

01:00:56.586 --> 01:01:02.759 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THAT'S BEING DONE.

01:01:00.824 --> 01:01:04.728 region:rollup2
SURE SO I'LL TAKE A. STAB IN

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:05.762 region:rollup2
THAN OTHERS CAN CHIME IN SO I

01:01:04.728 --> 01:01:07.364 region:rollup2
THINK THE.

01:01:05.762 --> 01:01:08.899 region:rollup2
AS THE AUDIT NOTED.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:13.103 region:rollup2
COUNTIES SO.

01:01:08.899 --> 01:01:14.838 region:rollup2
WE DON'T CLAIM NOR DO WE

01:01:13.103 --> 01:01:15.739 region:rollup2
AUTHORIZE SERVICES FOR MHSAA

01:01:14.838 --> 01:01:19.509 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO THE COUNTIES RECEIVE

01:01:15.739 --> 01:01:22.312 region:rollup2
MHSAA FUNDS DIRECTLY AND THEY

01:01:19.509 --> 01:01:26.116 region:rollup2
ARE THEN ALLOWED TO. CHANGE IN

01:01:22.312 --> 01:01:26.983 region:rollup2
THE LAST FEW YEARS AND CRACK.

01:01:26.116 --> 01:01:28.552 region:rollup2
WAS THAT IS THAT.

01:01:26.983 --> 01:01:29.019 region:rollup2
A CHANGE THAT HAS BENEFITED US

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.287 region:rollup2
AS THE STATE TO ENSURE

01:01:29.019 --> 01:01:31.221 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT.

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:35.091 region:rollup2
OR IS THAT SOMETHING THAT NEEDS

01:01:31.221 --> 01:01:36.259 region:rollup2
TO COME BACK IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE

01:01:35.091 --> 01:01:36.560 region:rollup2
FOUND WITH THIS ON IT LOVING I

01:01:36.259 --> 01:01:37.727 region:rollup2
WOULD SAY.

01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:38.528 region:rollup2
I THINK WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:01:37.727 --> 01:01:40.630 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH.

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:43.200 region:rollup2
WAS STILL.

01:01:40.630 --> 01:01:44.501 region:rollup2
OPERATIONAL NAM BEFORE IT WAS

01:01:43.200 --> 01:01:46.236 region:rollup2
DISSOLVED I THINK THAT WAS ONE

01:01:44.501 --> 01:01:48.538 region:rollup2
OF THE BIG FRUSTRATIONS OF A LOT

01:01:46.236 --> 01:01:49.506 region:rollup2
OF COUNTIES AND PROVIDERS FELT

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.408 region:rollup2
WAS IN ORDER TO SPEND A MINT

01:01:49.506 --> 01:01:53.109 region:rollup2
MHSAA FUNDS. ALL OF THAT HAD TO

01:01:51.408 --> 01:01:54.110 region:rollup2
BE APPROVED FIRST BY THE

01:01:53.109 --> 01:01:55.245 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AND I THINK WHEN THE

01:01:54.110 --> 01:01:57.948 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:01:55.245 --> 01:02:00.283 region:rollup2
WAS DISBANDED THAT WAS A

01:01:57.948 --> 01:02:01.885 region:rollup2
CHANGES REQUIRED VOTE OF TWO

01:02:00.283 --> 01:02:03.853 region:rollup2
THIRDS OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:02:01.885 --> 01:02:06.623 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT AMENDED THE ACT I'M

01:02:03.853 --> 01:02:08.959 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR. NODS TO MAKE SURE

01:02:06.623 --> 01:02:09.326 region:rollup2
THAT I'VE GOT MY FACTS STRAIGHT.

01:02:08.959 --> 01:02:10.994 region:rollup2
.

01:02:09.326 --> 01:02:11.995 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK IF YOU ASKED.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:12.529 region:rollup2
BE THERE PROVIDERS ARE COUNTIES

01:02:11.995 --> 01:02:12.729 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD SAY IT ACTUALLY

01:02:12.529 --> 01:02:13.496 region:rollup2
HELPS.

01:02:12.729 --> 01:02:14.664 region:rollup2
BOTH SPEED THE DELIVERY OF

01:02:13.496 --> 01:02:17.067 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:18.301 region:rollup2
IT CERTAINLY I MADE SURE THAT

01:02:17.067 --> 01:02:20.437 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES WERE GETTING FUNDS

01:02:18.301 --> 01:02:21.938 region:rollup2
IN A TIMELY WAY IN ORDER TO HELP

01:02:20.437 --> 01:02:23.173 region:rollup2
DELIVER SIR SERVICES AT THE

01:02:21.938 --> 01:02:25.375 region:rollup2
LOCAL LEVEL THEY STILL HAVE TO

01:02:23.173 --> 01:02:25.709 region:rollup2
GO THROUGH ALL OF THEIR LOCAL.

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.110 region:rollup2
PLANNING AND.

01:02:25.709 --> 01:02:28.645 region:rollup2
KIND OF.

01:02:27.110 --> 01:02:30.080 region:rollup2
I LOCAL CONVERSATION IN ORDER TO

01:02:28.645 --> 01:02:33.116 region:rollup2
ENSURE THOSE FUNDS ARE SPENT IN

01:02:30.080 --> 01:02:34.084 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT WAY. THE BACK END

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:36.253 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT IS THAT WE WILL.

01:02:34.084 --> 01:02:38.154 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THOSE REVENUE AND

01:02:36.253 --> 01:02:39.789 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE REPORTS.

01:02:38.154 --> 01:02:42.192 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:43.893 region:rollup2
THEY ARE EXPENDING THE FUNDS BUT

01:02:42.192 --> 01:02:46.696 region:rollup2
FROM A YOU'D WE DON'T DO A CLAIM

01:02:43.893 --> 01:02:48.431 region:rollup2
BY CLAIM KIND OF AUDIT. OF EACH

01:02:46.696 --> 01:02:49.633 region:rollup2
OF THOSE AND COUNTLESS OVER THE

01:02:48.431 --> 01:02:51.635 region:rollup2
REVENUE AND.

01:02:49.633 --> 01:02:58.608 region:rollup2
REPORTS IF WE CAN CHECK IS THAT

01:02:51.635 --> 01:02:58.608 region:rollup2
THE REPORT THAT'S ON PAGE.

01:02:58.675 --> 01:03:04.981 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE I GET ENOUGH TENDO.

01:02:59.609 --> 01:03:06.683 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN OF OUR HAND OUT.

01:03:04.981 --> 01:03:08.218 region:rollup2
NO THE SERVICE SO THERE'S.

01:03:06.683 --> 01:03:10.153 region:rollup2
.

01:03:08.218 --> 01:03:12.255 region:rollup2
SO BET MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:03:10.153 --> 01:03:13.423 region:rollup2
ACT ALLOCATE A SIGNIFICANT MOST

01:03:12.255 --> 01:03:14.391 region:rollup2
OF THE FUNDING GOES TO THE

01:03:13.423 --> 01:03:16.026 region:rollup2
COUNTIES FOR THE DELIVERY OF

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:18.328 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THERE IS

01:03:16.026 --> 01:03:18.828 region:rollup2
A STATE ADMIN COMPONENT OF AN

01:03:18.328 --> 01:03:21.197 region:rollup2
HSA SO WE THE DEPARTMENT

01:03:18.828 --> 01:03:22.365 region:rollup2
RECEIVE.

01:03:21.197 --> 01:03:23.967 region:rollup2
SOME OF THOSE STATE

01:03:22.365 --> 01:03:24.968 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE DOLLARS THAT

01:03:23.967 --> 01:03:26.670 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT COMMISSION RECEIVES

01:03:24.968 --> 01:03:28.305 region:rollup2
THE BULK OF THEM BUT THEN

01:03:26.670 --> 01:03:30.440 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:32.042 region:rollup2
RECEIVE THEM MILITARY CDC ARE

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:33.610 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA YOU

01:03:32.042 --> 01:03:34.811 region:rollup2
KNOW. I THINK THERE'S FIFTEEN

01:03:33.610 --> 01:03:36.479 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AND

01:03:34.811 --> 01:03:38.348 region:rollup2
ENTITIES THAT RECEIVE MEDICAL

01:03:36.479 --> 01:03:39.349 region:rollup2
SERVICES ACT DOLLARS EITHER FOR

01:03:38.348 --> 01:03:42.519 region:rollup2
PROGRAMMATIC.

01:03:39.349 --> 01:03:44.654 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONS OR FOR THEIR ROLE IN.

01:03:42.519 --> 01:03:46.523 region:rollup2
EITHER OVERSEEN OR OTHERWISE

01:03:44.654 --> 01:03:47.590 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERING FUNDS UP WHEN I'M

01:03:46.523 --> 01:03:48.992 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THIS THOUGH I'M

01:03:47.590 --> 01:03:50.894 region:rollup2
SEEING JANUARY OF TWENTY

01:03:48.992 --> 01:03:52.962 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN IS THERE AND JANUARY

01:03:50.894 --> 01:03:54.964 region:rollup2
OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN. REPORT

01:03:52.962 --> 01:03:57.267 region:rollup2
THAT'S DUE THERE IS A REPORT

01:03:54.964 --> 01:03:59.035 region:rollup2
THAT WE ARE HOPING TO FINALIZE

01:03:57.267 --> 01:04:01.971 region:rollup2
AND GET OUT CONSISTENT.

01:03:59.035 --> 01:04:04.341 region:rollup2
IF I'M NOT SURE FOR TRYING TO

01:04:01.971 --> 01:04:06.176 region:rollup2
GET OUT BEFORE OR IN LINE WITH

01:04:04.341 --> 01:04:07.310 region:rollup2
THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION.

01:04:06.176 --> 01:04:09.713 region:rollup2
THE REPORT WAS CERTAINLY

01:04:07.310 --> 01:04:11.314 region:rollup2
DELAYED THIS YEAR WHEN WE.

01:04:09.713 --> 01:04:12.782 region:rollup2
WERE TRYING TO GET IT RELEASE

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:12.949 region:rollup2
WITH THE GENERAL BUDGET THERE

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:13.917 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:15.652 region:rollup2
.

01:04:13.917 --> 01:04:18.288 region:rollup2
SOME DELAYS IN CERTAIN PIECES OF

01:04:15.652 --> 01:04:19.422 region:rollup2
THE REPORT SO I'M WE GET

01:04:18.288 --> 01:04:21.291 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PIECES OF DATA FROM

01:04:19.422 --> 01:04:22.692 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND SO THAT

01:04:21.291 --> 01:04:24.160 region:rollup2
JUST DELAYED THE OVERALL

01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:25.995 region:rollup2
COMPILATION OF THE REPORT BUT

01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:27.964 region:rollup2
WE'RE HOPING TO HAVE THAT

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:28.798 region:rollup2
FINALLY SHORTLY IMMINENT PASS IT

01:04:27.964 --> 01:04:31.234 region:rollup2
OFF YOU KNOW. I'M SURE YOU CAN

01:04:28.798 --> 01:04:33.436 region:rollup2
SENSE THE FRUSTRATION FROM OUR

01:04:31.234 --> 01:04:35.372 region:rollup2
INABILITY TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL

01:04:33.436 --> 01:04:36.439 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT OF STATE

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:37.073 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION FUNDS.

01:04:36.439 --> 01:04:38.508 region:rollup2
IF WE DON'T HAVE CURRENT DATA

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:40.777 region:rollup2
THAT IS BEFORE US

01:04:38.508 --> 01:04:42.746 region:rollup2
AND IT'S DIFFICULT FOR US TO

01:04:40.777 --> 01:04:44.047 region:rollup2
INVOLVE THE PUBLIC. AND TO HEAR

01:04:42.746 --> 01:04:46.449 region:rollup2
THE TESTIMONY THAT'S NECESSARY

01:04:44.047 --> 01:04:48.017 region:rollup2
FOR THESE TYPES OF CHANGES IN

01:04:46.449 --> 01:04:49.385 region:rollup2
SUCH A SHORT WINDOW AND SO I

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:50.987 region:rollup2
BELIEVE THAT'S WHY WE HAD

01:04:49.385 --> 01:04:52.622 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED THE DATES FOR

01:04:50.987 --> 01:04:54.858 region:rollup2
DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. AND THIS

01:04:52.622 --> 01:04:56.659 region:rollup2
REPORTS TO BE IN JANUARY SO THAT

01:04:54.858 --> 01:05:00.029 region:rollup2
WE IS A LEGISLATURE COULD.

01:04:56.659 --> 01:05:01.531 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THAT MEANINGFUL

01:05:00.029 --> 01:05:02.165 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT BUT WHAT WOULD MAKE

01:05:01.531 --> 01:05:02.832 region:rollup2
THINGS SIMPLER IT YES OF WE MAY

01:05:02.165 --> 01:05:04.634 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:05:02.832 --> 01:05:05.235 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE QUESTIONS IF YOU

01:05:04.634 --> 01:05:07.337 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T MIND.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:09.205 region:rollup2
OUR TIMING INTO YOURS.

01:05:07.337 --> 01:05:09.806 region:rollup2
BUT MY QUESTION IS THAT I

01:05:09.205 --> 01:05:11.040 region:rollup2
REMEMBER FROM LAST YEAR THEY

01:05:09.806 --> 01:05:13.076 region:rollup2
WERE DELAYED OUT AS WELL.

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:16.579 region:rollup2
SO IS THIS A REGULAR OCCURRENCE

01:05:13.076 --> 01:05:17.881 region:rollup2
THAT THE REPORTS ARE NOT GOING

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:18.915 region:rollup2
TO BE AVAILABLE ON TIME.

01:05:17.881 --> 01:05:20.116 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW THAT THE REPORT WAS

01:05:18.915 --> 01:05:21.518 region:rollup2
THAT DELAYED LAST YEAR I WAS

01:05:20.116 --> 01:05:22.452 region:rollup2
DELAYED LAST YEAR I THINK THAT

01:05:21.518 --> 01:05:25.421 region:rollup2
WAS MY FIRST JOB EXPERIENCE WITH

01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:26.790 region:rollup2
THE OVERSIGHT.

01:05:25.421 --> 01:05:27.457 region:rollup2
YET SO HOME I THINK IT'S JUST

01:05:26.790 --> 01:05:29.159 region:rollup2
HARD BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO GET

01:05:27.457 --> 01:05:30.927 region:rollup2
INFORMATION FROM SEVERAL

01:05:29.159 --> 01:05:31.594 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS IN THAT HAVE A LOT

01:05:30.927 --> 01:05:32.529 region:rollup2
OF BACK AND FORTH VICTIMS ON THE

01:05:31.594 --> 01:05:33.396 region:rollup2
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET

01:05:32.529 --> 01:05:34.998 region:rollup2
IT ACCURATE IN THAT WE COMPILE

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:37.934 region:rollup2
IT. SO THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE A

01:05:34.998 --> 01:05:40.203 region:rollup2
GOOD PRODUCT OF SOME FORWARD ON

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:42.439 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO MY INTO

01:05:40.203 --> 01:05:43.339 region:rollup2
IT AND I AM TRUMP I'M A WE HAD

01:05:42.439 --> 01:05:44.374 region:rollup2
AN OVERSIGHT O. OVER ANOTHER

01:05:43.339 --> 01:05:45.208 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND THE. THE COME.

01:05:44.374 --> 01:05:48.278 region:rollup2
THE COMPLAINT WAS THE SAME

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:50.480 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE REPORTING AND WHO

01:05:48.278 --> 01:05:53.082 region:rollup2
CREATES THE REPORTING.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:53.683 region:rollup2
WHO FOR CREATES THE THE METHOD

01:05:53.082 --> 01:05:54.551 region:rollup2
OF RAPPER OF REPORT A WEEK

01:05:53.683 --> 01:05:55.218 region:rollup2
CREATED AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:05:54.551 --> 01:05:58.588 region:rollup2
REFINING A TEMPLATE THAT WE SEND

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:59.422 region:rollup2
OUT TO ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:05:58.588 --> 01:06:00.056 region:rollup2
ENTITIES AND THEN MURDERED SO

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.157 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW MY PROBLEM WITH THIS

01:06:00.056 --> 01:06:02.058 region:rollup2
IS THAT WE CREATE? THE REPORTING

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:03.626 region:rollup2
AND YET WE COMPLAIN THAT BECAUSE

01:06:02.058 --> 01:06:06.729 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS IS SO COMPLICATED

01:06:03.626 --> 01:06:07.330 region:rollup2
AND WE CREATE PROCESS.

01:06:06.729 --> 01:06:08.998 region:rollup2
YOU SEE WHAT I'M SAYING SO

01:06:07.330 --> 01:06:09.899 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ASKING THESE ENTITIES TO

01:06:08.998 --> 01:06:13.336 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:14.337 region:rollup2
IN X. WAY RIGHT.

01:06:13.336 --> 01:06:15.004 region:rollup2
BUT I JUST HAVE TO TELL US WHAT

01:06:14.337 --> 01:06:15.672 region:rollup2
THEY'RE DOING WITH THE FUNDS AND

01:06:15.004 --> 01:06:16.372 region:rollup2
SO I AM OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:34.236 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE I.

01:14:32.935 --> 01:14:35.738 region:rollup2
GET FROM THE DEPARTMENT. WHAT IS

01:14:34.236 --> 01:14:36.405 region:rollup2
OUR APPROPRIATE FISCAL OVERSIGHT

01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:38.074 region:rollup2
AS A STATE WHAT IS OUR

01:14:36.405 --> 01:14:38.674 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT

01:14:38.074 --> 01:14:40.109 region:rollup2
THESE DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT

01:14:38.674 --> 01:14:40.609 region:rollup2
EFFECT?

01:14:40.109 --> 01:14:41.110 region:rollup2
GREAT SO.

01:14:40.609 --> 01:14:43.512 region:rollup2
AND I WILL CERTAINLY.

01:14:41.110 --> 01:14:44.280 region:rollup2
ALSO ASK FOR BOTH THE

01:14:43.512 --> 01:14:46.115 region:rollup2
COMMISSION AND.

01:14:44.280 --> 01:14:47.683 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO CHIME IN.

01:14:46.115 --> 01:14:48.117 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:49.685 region:rollup2
SHARING.

01:14:48.117 --> 01:14:51.220 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS INCLUDED IN YOUR

01:14:49.685 --> 01:14:53.222 region:rollup2
REPORT.

01:14:51.220 --> 01:14:54.390 region:rollup2
THE FILING OF THE ARE YOU ARE

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:55.558 region:rollup2
SO THEY REVENUE AND EXPENDITURE

01:14:54.390 --> 01:14:56.959 region:rollup2
REPORTS BY COUNTY WHEN THEY WERE

01:14:55.558 --> 01:14:59.028 region:rollup2
SUBMITTED WHEN THEY WERE

01:14:56.959 --> 01:15:00.563 region:rollup2
FINALIZED. ON IN SOME CASES THAT

01:14:59.028 --> 01:15:02.431 region:rollup2
WAS.

01:15:00.563 --> 01:15:04.300 region:rollup2
IT YEAH OUR WEIGHT BOTH PROVIDE

01:15:02.431 --> 01:15:05.968 region:rollup2
SOME GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND

01:15:04.300 --> 01:15:06.902 region:rollup2
WHICH COUNTIES HAD BEEN EITHER

01:15:05.968 --> 01:15:08.571 region:rollup2
PROVIDING ARE NOT PROVIDING THE

01:15:06.902 --> 01:15:11.741 region:rollup2
REPORTS WE CERTAINLY.

01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:11.907 region:rollup2
CAN ALSO APPRECIATE.

01:15:11.741 --> 01:15:14.510 region:rollup2
AS.

01:15:11.907 --> 01:15:16.846 region:rollup2
.

01:15:14.510 --> 01:15:18.314 region:rollup2
AS BOTH TOBY AND AKERSON SAID.

01:15:16.846 --> 01:15:18.647 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES HAVE THREE YEARS TO

01:15:18.314 --> 01:15:20.049 region:rollup2
EXPAND THESE.

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.816 region:rollup2
REVENUES AND SO SOMETIMES I

01:15:20.049 --> 01:15:23.452 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S.

01:15:20.816 --> 01:15:25.554 region:rollup2
A HESITANCY TO.

01:15:23.452 --> 01:15:26.689 region:rollup2
LEAP TOOK CERTAIN CONCLUSIONS

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:27.289 region:rollup2
LIKE AL YOU'VE GOT ALL THESE

01:15:26.689 --> 01:15:28.157 region:rollup2
RESERVES AND YOU HAVEN'T USED

01:15:27.289 --> 01:15:29.058 region:rollup2
THEM WHEN THEY HAVE ACTUALLY

01:15:28.157 --> 01:15:29.458 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS TO USE THOSE FUNDS

01:15:29.058 --> 01:15:30.693 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK.

01:15:29.458 --> 01:15:31.927 region:rollup2
WE ALSO TRY TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:33.462 region:rollup2
WHEN WE PROVIDE DATA.

01:15:31.927 --> 01:15:34.096 region:rollup2
EITHER TO YOU OR POST THE

01:15:33.462 --> 01:15:35.064 region:rollup2
REPORTS ONLINE THAT PEOPLE CAN

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.698 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THAT THE COUNTIES

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:36.732 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE TO USE THEM IN THE

01:15:35.698 --> 01:15:38.534 region:rollup2
YEAR IN WHICH THEY RECEIVE THOSE

01:15:36.732 --> 01:15:41.037 region:rollup2
FUNDS OR THEY CAN BE USING THEM

01:15:38.534 --> 01:15:42.038 region:rollup2
FOR LONGER TERM INITIATIVES.

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:43.539 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK.

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:46.108 region:rollup2
SO PART OF IT HAS BEEN A LITTLE

01:15:43.539 --> 01:15:46.308 region:rollup2
BIT GREATER TRANSPARENCY ON HOW

01:15:46.108 --> 01:15:49.111 region:rollup2
THE.

01:15:46.308 --> 01:15:52.348 region:rollup2
ARE YOURS HAVE BEEN FILED BUT

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:52.681 region:rollup2
ALSO WANTING TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:52.348 --> 01:15:53.949 region:rollup2
WE WORK WITH.

01:15:52.681 --> 01:15:54.950 region:rollup2
.

01:15:53.949 --> 01:15:55.518 region:rollup2
THERE'S AYE OUTSIDE VENDOR THAT

01:15:54.950 --> 01:15:57.153 region:rollup2
WORKS WITH THE COUNTIES TO

01:15:55.518 --> 01:15:57.653 region:rollup2
PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SO

01:15:57.153 --> 01:15:58.788 region:rollup2
THAT AREAS WHERE THEY'RE

01:15:57.653 --> 01:15:59.822 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING TO USE THE FUNDS ARE

01:15:58.788 --> 01:16:00.790 region:rollup2
LARGELY CONTAINED TO THE

01:15:59.822 --> 01:16:02.491 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND EARLY

01:16:00.790 --> 01:16:04.193 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION AND. PREVENTION AND

01:16:02.491 --> 01:16:05.628 region:rollup2
EARLY INTERVENTION FUNDS AS WELL

01:16:04.193 --> 01:16:09.165 region:rollup2
AS INNOVATION FUNDS SUCH A

01:16:05.628 --> 01:16:10.499 region:rollup2
SMALLER SUBSET OF THE LARGER ON

01:16:09.165 --> 01:16:11.867 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY ALLOCATION.

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:13.502 region:rollup2
I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE

01:16:11.867 --> 01:16:15.371 region:rollup2
THOUGHTS AS TO WHY THOSE FUNDS

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:17.139 region:rollup2
ARE EITHER HARDER TO SPEND OR

01:16:15.371 --> 01:16:18.307 region:rollup2
WHY AND THEY HAVE BEEN MORE

01:16:17.139 --> 01:16:19.642 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR THE COUNTIES TO

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:22.144 region:rollup2
SPEND AND SO I THINK. YOU'LL

01:16:19.642 --> 01:16:24.046 region:rollup2
HEAR FROM US A LOT OF INTEREST

01:16:22.144 --> 01:16:24.580 region:rollup2
IN WORKING CLOSELY WITH AND

01:16:24.046 --> 01:16:26.549 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO HELP.

01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.116 region:rollup2
EITHER THINK OF IDEAS AROUND

01:16:26.549 --> 01:16:29.351 region:rollup2
HOW THAT.

01:16:27.116 --> 01:16:30.753 region:rollup2
MONEY CAN BE SPENT BUT ALSO

01:16:29.351 --> 01:16:33.956 region:rollup2
MAKING SURE THAT IT IS AS.

01:16:30.753 --> 01:16:34.790 region:rollup2
TOBY SAID DELIVERING ON

01:16:33.956 --> 01:16:35.391 region:rollup2
THE PROMISE IN THE INTENT OF THE

01:16:34.790 --> 01:16:37.827 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE WHICH WAS IT WAS A

01:16:35.391 --> 01:16:39.095 region:rollup2
LOCALLY BASED LOCALLY DESIGNED

01:16:37.827 --> 01:16:41.530 region:rollup2
USE OF THOSE FUNDS TO BEST

01:16:39.095 --> 01:16:43.365 region:rollup2
TARGET. NEEDS AND LOCAL AREAS

01:16:41.530 --> 01:16:47.236 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU KNOW I'LL DEFER IF

01:16:43.365 --> 01:16:48.204 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER THOUGHTS ON THAT.

01:16:47.236 --> 01:16:49.672 region:rollup2
MY UNDERSTANDING TO OBVIOUSLY

01:16:48.204 --> 01:16:50.739 region:rollup2
YOUR PREVIOUS TESTIMONY WHERE

01:16:49.672 --> 01:16:52.508 region:rollup2
THERE WERE FIVE CORE METRICS

01:16:50.739 --> 01:16:54.610 region:rollup2
THAT WERE NEEDING TO BE.

01:16:52.508 --> 01:16:56.545 region:rollup2
FOLLOWED AND I'M WONDERING IF WE

01:16:54.610 --> 01:16:59.014 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY DATA OVER THE LAST

01:16:56.545 --> 01:17:00.850 region:rollup2
SEVERAL YEARS TO SHOW US HOW WE

01:16:59.014 --> 01:17:03.919 region:rollup2
ARE AS A STATE OR DO.

01:17:00.850 --> 01:17:05.488 region:rollup2
M. CAN I COMMENT ON THE FISCAL

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:06.555 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT RIGHT THANK YOU.

01:17:05.488 --> 01:17:08.557 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THE THE COMMISSION

01:17:06.555 --> 01:17:10.426 region:rollup2
EXISTS AS A COMPONENT OF THE MEN

01:17:08.557 --> 01:17:10.960 region:rollup2
HOW SERVICES ACT

01:17:10.426 --> 01:17:12.795 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THERE'S SAID.

01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:14.063 region:rollup2
.

01:17:12.795 --> 01:17:16.031 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THE PUBLIC AUTHORIZES A

01:17:14.063 --> 01:17:17.833 region:rollup2
TAX INCREASE

01:17:16.031 --> 01:17:18.734 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT THAT PROP FIFTY

01:17:17.833 --> 01:17:20.136 region:rollup2
THREE WAS DONE TO AN INITIATIVE.

01:17:18.734 --> 01:17:21.570 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN EXPECTATION

01:17:20.136 --> 01:17:25.374 region:rollup2
THAT THE MONEY WOULD BE WELL

01:17:21.570 --> 01:17:28.110 region:rollup2
SPENT AND AND SO YOU KNOW PART

01:17:25.374 --> 01:17:29.245 region:rollup2
OF THE REASON WHY IT IF YOU SORT

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:30.546 region:rollup2
OF YOU KNOW TALK TO CONSULTANT

01:17:29.245 --> 01:17:31.180 region:rollup2
TO THIS WORK. PART OF THE REASON

01:17:30.546 --> 01:17:32.548 region:rollup2
WHY WHEN YOU PUT IT A BALLOT

01:17:31.180 --> 01:17:33.949 region:rollup2
MEASURE OUT THERE FOR TAX

01:17:32.548 --> 01:17:34.850 region:rollup2
INCREASE THAT THEY INCLUDE AN

01:17:33.949 --> 01:17:36.151 region:rollup2
ENTITY LIKE THIS.

01:17:34.850 --> 01:17:37.887 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THERE'S.

01:17:36.151 --> 01:17:40.856 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE ARE TRUSTING THAT THE

01:17:37.887 --> 01:17:42.825 region:rollup2
MONEY THAT IS RAISED RIGHT.

01:17:40.856 --> 01:17:45.694 region:rollup2
WILL WILL GO TOWARDS THE REASONS

01:17:42.825 --> 01:17:46.428 region:rollup2
THAT PEOPLE ARE AGREEING TO TAX

01:17:45.694 --> 01:17:47.530 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES RIGHT THAT'S REALLY

01:17:46.428 --> 01:17:49.164 region:rollup2
WHAT PEOPLE ARE DOING.

01:17:47.530 --> 01:17:50.332 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING WHEN

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:53.168 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE SAYING ADDITIONAL

01:17:50.332 --> 01:17:54.537 region:rollup2
MONEY COMING IN BUT IT BUT NEEDS

01:17:53.168 --> 01:17:56.105 region:rollup2
NOT BEING MET PARTICULARLY IN

01:17:54.537 --> 01:17:57.072 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THE HOMELESS POPULATION

01:17:56.105 --> 01:17:58.440 region:rollup2
RIDE AND AND THERE'S THIS

01:17:57.072 --> 01:18:00.042 region:rollup2
DISCONNECT.

01:17:58.440 --> 01:18:01.544 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PEOPLE'S UNDERSTANDING

01:18:00.042 --> 01:18:03.412 region:rollup2
OF THE FISCAL REALITY OF GROWTH

01:18:01.544 --> 01:18:05.614 region:rollup2
IN SPENDING.

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:07.349 region:rollup2
AND INCREASES AN UNMET NEEDS AND

01:18:05.614 --> 01:18:09.451 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:10.719 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS LONG HAD A AN

01:18:09.451 --> 01:18:12.087 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT ROLE EVEN UNDER

01:18:10.719 --> 01:18:13.289 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT NINETEEN NINETY ONE

01:18:12.087 --> 01:18:14.356 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT CAME WITH A

01:18:13.289 --> 01:18:16.158 region:rollup2
COMMITMENT FOR THE STATE TO

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:17.893 region:rollup2
DEVELOP PERFORMANCE METRICS.

01:18:16.158 --> 01:18:19.361 region:rollup2
RIGHT AND SO THERE WAS THIS

01:18:17.893 --> 01:18:20.329 region:rollup2
ARRANGEMENT WHERE THE COUNTIES

01:18:19.361 --> 01:18:22.164 region:rollup2
WOULD WOULD HAVE GREATER

01:18:20.329 --> 01:18:23.399 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS THE DESIGN

01:18:22.164 --> 01:18:24.466 region:rollup2
OF THEIR SYSTEM.

01:18:23.399 --> 01:18:26.001 region:rollup2
IN EXCHANGE FOR A HIGHER LEVEL

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:27.570 region:rollup2
OF OUTCOME REPORTING

01:18:26.001 --> 01:18:28.170 region:rollup2
AND I THINK WE'VE STRUGGLED

01:18:27.570 --> 01:18:29.271 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY IT'S NOT EASY TO

01:18:28.170 --> 01:18:30.973 region:rollup2
DO.

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:32.841 region:rollup2
FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE RIGHT

01:18:30.973 --> 01:18:34.843 region:rollup2
THERE HAS THERE HAVE BEEN LOTS

01:18:32.841 --> 01:18:35.878 region:rollup2
OF ATTEMPTS AND IT IN INCLUDING

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:37.780 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION THAT YOU HAVE

01:18:35.878 --> 01:18:41.050 region:rollup2
AUTHORED MISTER CHAIR.

01:18:37.780 --> 01:18:44.520 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT THAT THE STATE

01:18:41.050 --> 01:18:45.688 region:rollup2
HAS LONG HELD THIS ROLE WHEN

01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:46.922 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A TIME WHEN IMAGES SAY

01:18:45.688 --> 01:18:48.657 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ACCRUED IN THE STATE

01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:51.694 region:rollup2
FUND. AND THE STATE ALLOCATED

01:18:48.657 --> 01:18:53.229 region:rollup2
THEM BASED ON COUNTY PLANS AND

01:18:51.694 --> 01:18:54.096 region:rollup2
AN OVERSIGHT WAS.

01:18:53.229 --> 01:18:56.932 region:rollup2
YEAH SORT OF IMPLEMENTED THROUGH

01:18:54.096 --> 01:18:58.100 region:rollup2
THAT PLAN REVIEW STAGE RIGHT.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:59.935 region:rollup2
BUT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO IS

01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:01.403 region:rollup2
SHIFT THAT TO DO OVERSIGHT IN

01:18:59.935 --> 01:19:03.205 region:rollup2
TERMS OF.

01:19:01.403 --> 01:19:04.740 region:rollup2
AND MORE TRANSPARENCY MORE

01:19:03.205 --> 01:19:06.675 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING BUT ALSO THE

01:19:04.740 --> 01:19:07.810 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND AND I WAS

01:19:06.675 --> 01:19:08.877 region:rollup2
REFERENCING ANOTHER UNDER THAT

01:19:07.810 --> 01:19:10.079 region:rollup2
PREVENTION INTERVENTION

01:19:08.877 --> 01:19:11.413 region:rollup2
COMPONENT THERE ARE SEVEN

01:19:10.079 --> 01:19:13.382 region:rollup2
NEGATIVE OUTCOMES THAT ARE

01:19:11.413 --> 01:19:15.351 region:rollup2
DESIGNED TO BE REDUCED AND SO

01:19:13.382 --> 01:19:18.721 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING.

01:19:15.351 --> 01:19:20.856 region:rollup2
TO A WE HAVE A VIDEO SCREEN WITH

01:19:18.721 --> 01:19:22.391 region:rollup2
THE EIGHT CS WE HAVE A DATA YOU

01:19:20.856 --> 01:19:23.058 region:rollup2
SCREW THE PARTNER JUSTICE WERE

01:19:22.391 --> 01:19:24.159 region:rollup2
WORKING TO LINK THOSE DATA SETS

01:19:23.058 --> 01:19:25.794 region:rollup2
SO WE CAN. TRACK AND

01:19:24.159 --> 01:19:26.795 region:rollup2
INCARCERATION RATES ONE OF THE

01:19:25.794 --> 01:19:28.197 region:rollup2
GOALS OF OF PREVENTION AND

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:30.399 region:rollup2
INTERVENTIONS TO REDUCE THE

01:19:28.197 --> 01:19:30.1000 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF FOLKS WITH MENTAL

01:19:30.399 --> 01:19:32.201 region:rollup2
HEALTH NEEDS WHO WERE JAILED.

01:19:30.1000 --> 01:19:33.636 region:rollup2
.

01:19:32.201 --> 01:19:35.871 region:rollup2
THAT WORK HAS BEEN DONE FOR IN

01:19:33.636 --> 01:19:38.173 region:rollup2
OTHER PLACES FOR OVER A DECADE

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:40.342 region:rollup2
ITS NOT EASY TO DO THE DATA AT

01:19:38.173 --> 01:19:41.510 region:rollup2
THE DOJ ISN'T ALWAYS YOU KNOW

01:19:40.342 --> 01:19:42.144 region:rollup2
IT'S IT CAN BE HARD TO MATCH

01:19:41.510 --> 01:19:43.512 region:rollup2
USING AND ABUSING PROBABILISTIC

01:19:42.144 --> 01:19:44.880 region:rollup2
MATCHING.

01:19:43.512 --> 01:19:46.482 region:rollup2
WE'RE WORKING TO DO THAT WITH CD

01:19:44.880 --> 01:19:48.484 region:rollup2
<u><c.green>ON EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES</c></u>

01:19:46.482 --> 01:19:50.152 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S ONE OF THE GOALS

01:19:48.484 --> 01:19:50.786 region:rollup2
OF THE ACT IS TO IS TO USE MEN

01:19:50.152 --> 01:19:51.587 region:rollup2
HOW STRATEGIES TO REDUCE SCHOOL

01:19:50.786 --> 01:19:53.756 region:rollup2
FAILURE.

01:19:51.587 --> 01:19:55.958 region:rollup2
THAT'S AN AREA THAT'S VERY

01:19:53.756 --> 01:19:58.293 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING A WEEK WE'VE SEEN A

01:19:55.958 --> 01:19:59.461 region:rollup2
LONG HISTORY OF OF COMPETITION

01:19:58.293 --> 01:20:00.629 region:rollup2
BETWEEN COUNTIES AND SCHOOLS

01:19:59.461 --> 01:20:02.765 region:rollup2
OVER SCARCE RESOURCES WHO PAYS

01:20:00.629 --> 01:20:03.866 region:rollup2
SO TO SPEAK.

01:20:02.765 --> 01:20:05.100 region:rollup2
AND SO PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:20:03.866 --> 01:20:06.735 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH COMMISSION IS TRYING

01:20:05.100 --> 01:20:08.737 region:rollup2
TO DO IS TO MEET THAT PUBLIC

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:09.805 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION. OF OVERSIGHT AND

01:20:08.737 --> 01:20:10.873 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY BY MAKING IT

01:20:09.805 --> 01:20:12.708 region:rollup2
EASIER FOR EVERYBODY TO

01:20:10.873 --> 01:20:13.976 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MONEY'S

01:20:12.708 --> 01:20:15.210 region:rollup2
COMING FROM WHERE IT'S GOING HOW

01:20:13.976 --> 01:20:16.845 region:rollup2
IT'S BEING USED.

01:20:15.210 --> 01:20:17.646 region:rollup2
AND WHAT THE PUBLIC IS GETTING

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:19.815 region:rollup2
FOR ITS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH BANG

01:20:17.646 --> 01:20:20.883 region:rollup2
FOR THE BUCK ARE YOU GETTING.

01:20:19.815 --> 01:20:22.384 region:rollup2
THAT THE MORE DIFFICULT PIECE

01:20:20.883 --> 01:20:25.254 region:rollup2
BUT THIS IS OFTEN MORE IMPORTANT

01:20:22.384 --> 01:20:26.822 region:rollup2
PIECE IS TO THAN HELP YOU AS

01:20:25.254 --> 01:20:28.757 region:rollup2
POLICY MAKERS AND HELP THE

01:20:26.822 --> 01:20:30.092 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT ALSO ON THE POLICY

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:31.760 region:rollup2
SIDE IN THE COUNTIES AS THE

01:20:30.092 --> 01:20:33.729 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO ARE RUNNING SYSTEMS.

01:20:31.760 --> 01:20:34.530 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS.

01:20:33.729 --> 01:20:36.465 region:rollup2
THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:20:34.530 --> 01:20:37.900 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS CAN CREATE IN TERMS

01:20:36.465 --> 01:20:39.468 region:rollup2
OF HOW WE APPROACH DIFFERENT

01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:40.269 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES AND SO YOU KNOW YOU

01:20:39.468 --> 01:20:41.603 region:rollup2
GOT IN YOUR PACKET SOME

01:20:40.269 --> 01:20:43.272 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS PRESS ABOUT INNOVATION

01:20:41.603 --> 01:20:44.640 region:rollup2
INCUBATOR OUTLET TO GET TO. BUT

01:20:43.272 --> 01:20:46.041 region:rollup2
PART OF THAT WORK IS TO REALLY

01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.176 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE

01:20:46.041 --> 01:20:49.678 region:rollup2
TO STRENGTHEN THAT OVERALL

01:20:47.176 --> 01:20:50.713 region:rollup2
STRATEGY AROUND USING DATA TO

01:20:49.678 --> 01:20:52.381 region:rollup2
MAKE BETTER DECISIONS ABOUT

01:20:50.713 --> 01:20:53.349 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING WE HAVE NOW WHERE

01:20:52.381 --> 01:20:56.251 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO BE HEADED WHAT'S

01:20:53.349 --> 01:20:57.386 region:rollup2
WORKING AND FOR WHOM AND THAT'S

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:58.354 region:rollup2
A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT.

01:20:57.386 --> 01:20:58.921 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU CAN HAVE EVIDENCE

01:20:58.354 --> 01:20:59.588 region:rollup2
BASED PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN

01:20:58.921 --> 01:21:01.190 region:rollup2
CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTS FOR CERTAIN

01:20:59.588 --> 01:21:02.024 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT JUST DON'T WORK FOR

01:21:01.190 --> 01:21:04.259 region:rollup2
OTHER PEOPLE IN OTHER

01:21:02.024 --> 01:21:05.728 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTS AND QUITE OFTEN

01:21:04.259 --> 01:21:07.062 region:rollup2
THAT NO ONE GETS LOST IN THE

01:21:05.728 --> 01:21:09.131 region:rollup2
SORT OF BROADER. HIGH LEVEL KIND

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:10.733 region:rollup2
OF ANNOUNCES BUT I THINK THE THE

01:21:09.131 --> 01:21:12.735 region:rollup2
POINT IS WELL TAKEN MISTER CHAIR

01:21:10.733 --> 01:21:13.969 region:rollup2
THAT THE STATE HAS AN ONGOING

01:21:12.735 --> 01:21:15.437 region:rollup2
OBLIGATION.

01:21:13.969 --> 01:21:16.372 region:rollup2
TO FOR A VERY HIGH LEVEL OF

01:21:15.437 --> 01:21:17.706 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE AROUND

01:21:16.372 --> 01:21:18.907 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS

01:21:17.706 --> 01:21:20.609 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'RE MAKING PROGRESS IN

01:21:18.907 --> 01:21:22.277 region:rollup2
THAT AREA CLEARLY THE REPORTING

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:23.746 region:rollup2
IS IS AN ESSENTIAL ELEMENT YOU

01:21:22.277 --> 01:21:25.481 region:rollup2
CAN'T DO YOUR JOB WE CAN'T DO

01:21:23.746 --> 01:21:26.315 region:rollup2
OUR JOB. IF WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:21:25.481 --> 01:21:29.118 region:rollup2
INFORMATION AVAILABLE.

01:21:26.315 --> 01:21:30.386 region:rollup2
AND.

01:21:29.118 --> 01:21:32.688 region:rollup2
AND QUITE WELL SAID A MEAN ONE

01:21:30.386 --> 01:21:34.990 region:rollup2
SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL FOR A STATE

01:21:32.688 --> 01:21:37.426 region:rollup2
THE SIZE OF CALIFORNIA NOR DO I

01:21:34.990 --> 01:21:38.894 region:rollup2
THINK WORK TRYING TO. DICTATE TO

01:21:37.426 --> 01:21:40.863 region:rollup2
REACH IN AND EACH INDIVIDUAL

01:21:38.894 --> 01:21:42.064 region:rollup2
COUNTY WHAT.

01:21:40.863 --> 01:21:44.032 region:rollup2
NEEDS THEY HAVE WITHIN THEIR

01:21:42.064 --> 01:21:46.301 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BUT.

01:21:44.032 --> 01:21:47.269 region:rollup2
I THINK WE AS A STATE SHOULD SET

01:21:46.301 --> 01:21:49.171 region:rollup2
UP SOME FRAMEWORK TO AT LEAST

01:21:47.269 --> 01:21:50.973 region:rollup2
DESCRIBED.

01:21:49.171 --> 01:21:53.142 region:rollup2
HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE BEING SPENT

01:21:50.973 --> 01:21:54.943 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH IS BEING

01:21:53.142 --> 01:21:56.779 region:rollup2
KEPT IN RESERVES?

01:21:54.943 --> 01:21:58.480 region:rollup2
AND SO MY NEXT SET OF QUESTIONS

01:21:56.779 --> 01:22:01.116 region:rollup2
IF I CAN IS.

01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:03.619 region:rollup2
WHAT IS A PRUDENT RESERVE IS

01:22:01.116 --> 01:22:06.555 region:rollup2
THERE A CAP ON THE SIZE OF A

01:22:03.619 --> 01:22:08.690 region:rollup2
RESERVE THAT A? COUNTY SHOULD BE

01:22:06.555 --> 01:22:09.458 region:rollup2
HOLDING ON TO AND HOW DO YOU

01:22:08.690 --> 01:22:12.294 region:rollup2
MAKE THOSE TYPES OF

01:22:09.458 --> 01:22:13.028 region:rollup2
DETERMINATIONS.

01:22:12.294 --> 01:22:15.030 region:rollup2
I KNOW THAT.

01:22:13.028 --> 01:22:17.633 region:rollup2
IT WAS SOMETHING THAT WE

01:22:15.030 --> 01:22:19.935 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGED IN THE AUDIT AND.

01:22:17.633 --> 01:22:20.636 region:rollup2
IN THE FISCAL REGULATIONS THAT

01:22:19.935 --> 01:22:23.105 region:rollup2
WERE.

01:22:20.636 --> 01:22:23.705 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY UNDER DEVELOP

01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:24.740 region:rollup2
WITH OUR DEPARTMENT ANYWHERE

01:22:23.705 --> 01:22:27.376 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING A COUPLE DIFFERENT

01:22:24.740 --> 01:22:29.645 region:rollup2
THINGS I'M PRUDENT RESERVE AS

01:22:27.376 --> 01:22:31.280 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE USE OF INTEREST SO

01:22:29.645 --> 01:22:33.048 region:rollup2
IF YOU DO HAVE FUNDS AGAIN IF.

01:22:31.280 --> 01:22:35.217 region:rollup2
IF YOU'RE ALLOWED THREE YEARS

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:37.653 region:rollup2
TO EXPAND THOSE FUNDS OBVIOUSLY

01:22:35.217 --> 01:22:40.222 region:rollup2
INTEREST ACCRUES ON. ON THAT.

01:22:37.653 --> 01:22:41.356 region:rollup2
I THINK WE'VE SAID THAT.

01:22:40.222 --> 01:22:42.791 region:rollup2
WE KIND OF ARE SETTING IN THE

01:22:41.356 --> 01:22:44.760 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS WHAT WE CONSIDER TO

01:22:42.791 --> 01:22:45.327 region:rollup2
BE A PRUDENT RESERVE AND

01:22:44.760 --> 01:22:47.362 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING.

01:22:45.327 --> 01:22:48.697 region:rollup2
COUNTY SOMETIMES HAVE THESE

01:22:47.362 --> 01:22:50.065 region:rollup2
RESERVES BECAUSE AS WE ARE

01:22:48.697 --> 01:22:51.500 region:rollup2
SETTLING NOW AND THIS IS THE

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:53.735 region:rollup2
FIRST TIME I'LL I'LL GET BACK TO

01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:55.771 region:rollup2
THIS BRAIDED FUNDING. IS WHEN

01:22:53.735 --> 01:22:57.239 region:rollup2
WE'RE IN.

01:22:55.771 --> 01:22:58.974 region:rollup2
AND A COUNTY AND WE'RE DOING AT

01:22:57.239 --> 01:23:01.810 region:rollup2
COSTS RECONCILIATION ON THEIR

01:22:58.974 --> 01:23:03.946 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES FOR MEDI CAL AND WE

01:23:01.810 --> 01:23:04.980 region:rollup2
WILL LOOK AT A CLAIM AND SAY.

01:23:03.946 --> 01:23:08.584 region:rollup2
THAT WAS AN ALLOWABLE

01:23:04.980 --> 01:23:11.353 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURE FOR MEDI CAL FUNDING

01:23:08.584 --> 01:23:13.522 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY CAN.

01:23:11.353 --> 01:23:14.156 region:rollup2
CANCEL THAT CLAIM WITH US AND

01:23:13.522 --> 01:23:15.824 region:rollup2
HAY THAT WITH MENTAL HEALTH

01:23:14.156 --> 01:23:16.391 region:rollup2
SERVICES ACT FUNDING AND SO

01:23:15.824 --> 01:23:17.059 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THAT'S WHAT THE

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:18.360 region:rollup2
RESERVE IS USE FOR TO KNOW THAT

01:23:17.059 --> 01:23:18.961 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES OF CERTAINLY.

01:23:18.360 --> 01:23:19.561 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE

01:23:18.961 --> 01:23:20.062 region:rollup2
ENOUGH FUNDS THAT WHEN WE GO

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:20.963 region:rollup2
BACK AND DO THOSE COSTS

01:23:20.062 --> 01:23:23.065 region:rollup2
RECONCILIATIONS THAT THEY HAVE

01:23:20.963 --> 01:23:24.666 region:rollup2
THAT IN PLACE AND SO. THE

01:23:23.065 --> 01:23:25.834 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS AND I CAN'T REMEMBER

01:23:24.666 --> 01:23:27.402 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:29.304 region:rollup2
HEAD BUT THERE'S A. THERE WILL

01:23:27.402 --> 01:23:30.272 region:rollup2
BE VERY CLEAR KIND OF

01:23:29.304 --> 01:23:31.707 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGES OF WHAT WE EXPECT

01:23:30.272 --> 01:23:32.875 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO HAVE TO HOLD ITS

01:23:31.707 --> 01:23:34.710 region:rollup2
PRUDENT RESERVES AND ANYTHING

01:23:32.875 --> 01:23:39.181 region:rollup2
AFTER THAT WOULD BE DEEMED TO

01:23:34.710 --> 01:23:40.849 region:rollup2
PROBABLY ACCESS.

01:23:39.181 --> 01:23:43.886 region:rollup2
WE'RE GONNA RUBIO YES JUST.

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:44.486 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF A COOK SO WE KEEP

01:23:43.886 --> 01:23:45.287 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT PERCENTAGES HOW

01:23:44.486 --> 01:23:47.856 region:rollup2
MUCH MONEY IS?

01:23:45.287 --> 01:23:49.291 region:rollup2
GIVEN TO COUNTIES HOW MUCH MORE

01:23:47.856 --> 01:23:52.928 region:rollup2
MONEY DO WE HAVE IN RESERVE AND.

01:23:49.291 --> 01:23:54.396 region:rollup2
YEAH LET'S START WITH THOSE.

01:23:52.928 --> 01:23:55.597 region:rollup2
SO LAST YEAR CHRIS COOK A

01:23:54.396 --> 01:23:57.266 region:rollup2
FINANCE A LAST YEAR THERE'S

01:23:55.597 --> 01:23:57.866 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT EIGHT

01:23:57.266 --> 01:23:58.133 region:rollup2
BILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED THE

01:23:57.866 --> 01:24:01.203 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

01:23:58.133 --> 01:24:03.739 region:rollup2
FOR THE.

01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:05.908 region:rollup2
SURE OKAY FOR ITS OIL WOULD THAT

01:24:03.739 --> 01:24:07.643 region:rollup2
BE CAN I ASSUME THAT THAT WAS

01:24:05.908 --> 01:24:09.912 region:rollup2
EVERY YEAR. THAT THE PHENOMENA

01:24:07.643 --> 01:24:13.849 region:rollup2
REVENUE HAS BEEN INCREASING.

01:24:09.912 --> 01:24:15.117 region:rollup2
ANYWHERE HELPS UP YEAH I DON'T

01:24:13.849 --> 01:24:16.485 region:rollup2
HAVE THE HIGHEST OVER THE PAST

01:24:15.117 --> 01:24:18.353 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS YEAH OK YEAHIT'S

01:24:16.485 --> 01:24:19.354 region:rollup2
IT'S PEGGED TO CAPITAL GAINS. SO

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.422 region:rollup2
DEPENDING ON HOW WELL OUR

01:24:19.354 --> 01:24:22.391 region:rollup2
ECONOMY IS DOING THAT TAX

01:24:20.422 --> 01:24:22.991 region:rollup2
REVENUE FLUCTUATES GREATLY. I'M

01:24:22.391 --> 01:24:23.191 region:rollup2
SO THEN THERE'S A METHODOLOGY

01:24:22.991 --> 01:24:24.993 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:27.029 region:rollup2
FINANCE WORKS THROUGH AND EACH

01:24:24.993 --> 01:24:29.264 region:rollup2
COUNTY GETS A CERTAIN ALLOCATION

01:24:27.029 --> 01:24:32.034 region:rollup2
AND THEN IT'S BUCKET INTO THE

01:24:29.264 --> 01:24:33.902 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SUPPORTS THAT P. AND I

01:24:32.034 --> 01:24:36.104 region:rollup2
WHICH IS THE. PREVENTION EARLY

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:38.140 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION INNOVATION FUNDS

01:24:36.104 --> 01:24:41.410 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY'RE GIVEN THREE

01:24:38.140 --> 01:24:43.679 region:rollup2
YEARS TO EXPAND THOSE FUNDS AND

01:24:41.410 --> 01:24:47.282 region:rollup2
SO EACH COUNTY HAS ITS OWN.

01:24:43.679 --> 01:24:48.984 region:rollup2
EITHER RESERVE OR THERE ARE

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:50.619 region:rollup2
FUNDS THAT ARE WITHIN THOSE

01:24:48.984 --> 01:24:56.058 region:rollup2
COUNTY ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE

01:24:50.619 --> 01:24:57.893 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO PERVERSION WHICH IS

01:24:56.058 --> 01:25:00.662 region:rollup2
THE OTHER HIGH POINT OF THE

01:24:57.893 --> 01:25:08.270 region:rollup2
AUDIT WHICH WAS HOW LONG THEY

01:25:00.662 --> 01:25:08.904 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN SITTING ON THOSE FUNDS

01:25:08.270 --> 01:25:09.538 region:rollup2
OR HOW MUCH MONEY DO WE HAVE AN

01:25:08.904 --> 01:25:09.972 region:rollup2
RETURNS.

01:25:09.538 --> 01:25:11.506 region:rollup2
I THINK WE HAVE.

01:25:09.972 --> 01:25:12.107 region:rollup2
AB ONE FOURTEEN AND THE

01:25:11.506 --> 01:25:12.674 region:rollup2
CALCULATIONS THAT WE HAD HAD

01:25:12.107 --> 01:25:13.609 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATE TWO HUNDRED AND

01:25:12.674 --> 01:25:17.746 region:rollup2
THIRTY ONE MILLION THAT WAS

01:25:13.609 --> 01:25:19.881 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO REVERSION.

01:25:17.746 --> 01:25:21.083 region:rollup2
I'M NOT TO RIVERS AND.

01:25:19.881 --> 01:25:22.584 region:rollup2
I'M TALKING ABOUT RESERVES

01:25:21.083 --> 01:25:29.758 region:rollup2
LITTLE SO.

01:25:22.584 --> 01:25:30.826 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE CAN SAYS IT'S

01:25:29.758 --> 01:25:31.393 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW UP UNTIL LAST YEAR LAST

01:25:30.826 --> 01:25:33.295 region:rollup2
YEAR THERE WAS A RIVER OR A

01:25:31.393 --> 01:25:35.764 region:rollup2
CHANGE IN THE LAW FOR SMALL

01:25:33.295 --> 01:25:36.365 region:rollup2
COUNTIES BUT GENERALLY IT'S

01:25:35.764 --> 01:25:36.598 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS TO USE THE MONEY I

01:25:36.365 --> 01:25:38.433 region:rollup2
LISTEN.

01:25:36.598 --> 01:25:39.334 region:rollup2
FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND I

01:25:38.433 --> 01:25:41.737 region:rollup2
WAS NOT PART OF THE FOLKS

01:25:39.334 --> 01:25:43.338 region:rollup2
ATTRACTED THIS BUT CLEARLY WAS

01:25:41.737 --> 01:25:43.839 region:rollup2
HELP MAKE THE CASE FOR THAT AND

01:25:43.338 --> 01:25:45.540 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL

01:25:43.839 --> 01:25:46.808 region:rollup2
REVENUES.

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:47.743 region:rollup2
THE IDEA WAS THAT IT COUNTIES

01:25:46.808 --> 01:25:48.610 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE ABLE TO SPEND ALL THE

01:25:47.743 --> 01:25:49.811 region:rollup2
MONEY IN THE FIRST YEAR REMEMBER

01:25:48.610 --> 01:25:51.246 region:rollup2
SOME OF THE MONEY COMES IN IN

01:25:49.811 --> 01:25:52.748 region:rollup2
THE ELEVENTH MONTH. OR THE

01:25:51.246 --> 01:25:53.448 region:rollup2
TWELFTH MONTH OF THE FISCAL YEAR

01:25:52.748 --> 01:25:55.117 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S A AND

01:25:53.448 --> 01:25:57.319 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU MAY NOT

01:25:55.117 --> 01:25:58.320 region:rollup2
BILL TO SPEND YOUR ENTIRE APRIL

01:25:57.319 --> 01:25:59.121 region:rollup2
PAYCHECK BY THE END OF APRIL.

01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:00.389 region:rollup2
SO SOME OF THAT YOU SPEND IN MAY

01:25:59.121 --> 01:26:03.425 region:rollup2
OR JUNE.

01:26:00.389 --> 01:26:05.027 region:rollup2
BUT THE THE IDEA WAS NOT THAT

01:26:03.425 --> 01:26:07.095 region:rollup2
YOU COULD SIT ON THE MONEY FOR

01:26:05.027 --> 01:26:07.663 region:rollup2
TWO AND A HALF YEARS AND THEN

01:26:07.095 --> 01:26:08.630 region:rollup2
ONLY BEGIN TO USE IT IN THE

01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:10.165 region:rollup2
THIRD YEAR.

01:26:08.630 --> 01:26:13.268 region:rollup2
WHEN WE'VE LOOKED AT A SAMPLE

01:26:10.165 --> 01:26:13.902 region:rollup2
OF COUNTIES WE SEE SOME COUNTIES

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:15.470 region:rollup2
WELL TO MAKE IT BACK TO THE TO

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:16.138 region:rollup2
PRESERVE PEACE. SO THE COUNTIES

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:17.472 region:rollup2
ARE ALLOWED TO PUT FUNDS INTO A

01:26:16.138 --> 01:26:18.807 region:rollup2
PRUDENT RESERVE TO RAINY DAY

01:26:17.472 --> 01:26:20.108 region:rollup2
FUND A LOCK BOX THE MONEY GOES

01:26:18.807 --> 01:26:23.011 region:rollup2
THERE. AND THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

01:26:20.108 --> 01:26:24.746 region:rollup2
SHIFT UP TO TWENTY PERCENT OF

01:26:23.011 --> 01:26:25.681 region:rollup2
THEIR OF US WHAT'S CALLED A CSS

01:26:24.746 --> 01:26:28.216 region:rollup2
COMPONENT INTO THAT PRETTY

01:26:25.681 --> 01:26:29.117 region:rollup2
RESERVE IF THEY DO THAT IT'S NOT

01:26:28.216 --> 01:26:31.119 region:rollup2
SUBJECT TO REVERSION.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:32.120 region:rollup2
IT REALLY IS A RAINY DAY FUND

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:33.221 region:rollup2
AND IT'S IN A LOCK BOX WERE IN

01:26:32.120 --> 01:26:34.423 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:26:33.221 --> 01:26:35.857 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE SERVICES ESTABLISHES

01:26:34.423 --> 01:26:37.659 region:rollup2
PARAMETERS UNDER WHICH THIS FUND

01:26:35.857 --> 01:26:38.360 region:rollup2
CAN BE ACCESSED OKAY NOW ARMED

01:26:37.659 --> 01:26:39.728 region:rollup2
MAN IF I CAN FIND ME. SO TWENTY

01:26:38.360 --> 01:26:40.929 region:rollup2
PERCENT BUT THEY'RE ALLOWED TO

01:26:39.728 --> 01:26:42.664 region:rollup2
KEEP THE MONEY FOR.

01:26:40.929 --> 01:26:43.899 region:rollup2
FOR THREE YEARS SO I'M ASSUMING

01:26:42.664 --> 01:26:45.500 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT WERE YOUR ONE

01:26:43.899 --> 01:26:47.469 region:rollup2
TWENTY PRESENT YOUR TWO OR TOTAL

01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:51.473 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT FOR THE THREE

01:26:47.469 --> 01:26:52.607 region:rollup2
YEAR EACH YEAR EACH SONG. OKAY

01:26:51.473 --> 01:26:54.042 region:rollup2
BUT WHILE THAT'S RIGHT IN OTHER

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:55.310 region:rollup2
WORDS THERE'S THERE'S THE

01:26:54.042 --> 01:26:58.914 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY FOR COUNTIES THAT

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:59.715 region:rollup2
THAT CAN SHIFT THERE'S ACTUALLY

01:26:58.914 --> 01:27:01.416 region:rollup2
A LIMIT ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN

01:26:59.715 --> 01:27:03.151 region:rollup2
SHIFT OUR RIGHT THEY DON'T HAVE

01:27:01.416 --> 01:27:05.721 region:rollup2
TO SHIFT ANY BUT IF THEY WANT TO

01:27:03.151 --> 01:27:06.855 region:rollup2
PUT INTO A RAINY DAY FUND. FOR

01:27:05.721 --> 01:27:09.858 region:rollup2
DOWNTURNS IN THE ECONOMY THAT'S

01:27:06.855 --> 01:27:12.861 region:rollup2
FOR THE PRINT RESERVES FOR THE

01:27:09.858 --> 01:27:15.063 region:rollup2
RIVERS AND RULES DON'T APPLY TO

01:27:12.861 --> 01:27:16.264 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW SO I UNDERSTAND THAT

01:27:15.063 --> 01:27:18.834 region:rollup2
BUT JUST SO THAT THAT SO THAT

01:27:16.264 --> 01:27:22.204 region:rollup2
I'M CLEAR ON ON THE TWENTY

01:27:18.834 --> 01:27:23.605 region:rollup2
PERCENT I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

01:27:22.204 --> 01:27:27.509 region:rollup2
THE. RIVERS AND.

01:27:23.605 --> 01:27:29.211 region:rollup2
MONEY I'M ASKING ABOUT THE

01:27:27.509 --> 01:27:33.715 region:rollup2
RAINY DAY SOUL.

01:27:29.211 --> 01:27:36.818 region:rollup2
IN THREE YEARS LET'S ASSUME AND

01:27:33.715 --> 01:27:40.822 region:rollup2
I'M JUST IN GENERAL LET'S USE

01:27:36.818 --> 01:27:41.389 region:rollup2
THE BILLION DOLLARS.

01:27:40.822 --> 01:27:54.536 region:rollup2
AS AS A AS A BANE RESERVE OR

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:56.037 region:rollup2
THERE'S HIGH HIGH

01:27:54.536 --> 01:27:58.473 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF VARIATION IT'S THE

01:27:56.037 --> 01:28:00.642 region:rollup2
OTHER THE OTHER RESERVE THAT YOU

01:27:58.473 --> 01:28:01.643 region:rollup2
SHOULD THINK ABOUT OF THE FUNDS

01:28:00.642 --> 01:28:03.044 region:rollup2
THAT AREN'T IN THE PRUDENT

01:28:01.643 --> 01:28:04.479 region:rollup2
RESERVE THAT JUST AREN'T BEING

01:28:03.044 --> 01:28:05.714 region:rollup2
SPENT.

01:28:04.479 --> 01:28:07.382 region:rollup2
THEY'RE BEING HELD FOR CASH FLOW

01:28:05.714 --> 01:28:08.617 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OVER THAT THREE YEAR

01:28:07.382 --> 01:28:10.719 region:rollup2
PERIOD AND AND SO WE WE SEE

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:11.853 region:rollup2
VARIATION OF SOME COUNTIES THAT

01:28:10.719 --> 01:28:14.589 region:rollup2
ARE KEEPING MAYBE SIX MONTHS OF

01:28:11.853 --> 01:28:17.893 region:rollup2
CASH ON HAND. IT REALLY IS

01:28:14.589 --> 01:28:20.629 region:rollup2
CHECKS ARE COMING IN AND CHECKS

01:28:17.893 --> 01:28:21.296 region:rollup2
ARE GOING OUT IN THE SKY KEEPING

01:28:20.629 --> 01:28:23.365 region:rollup2
AT A RUNNING BALANCE HERE WE SEE

01:28:21.296 --> 01:28:25.167 region:rollup2
OTHER COUNTIES. THAT ARE SITTING

01:28:23.365 --> 01:28:26.067 region:rollup2
ON TWO AND A HALF YEARS OF

01:28:25.167 --> 01:28:27.135 region:rollup2
REVENUES IN THEIR ONLY BEGINNING

01:28:26.067 --> 01:28:31.706 region:rollup2
TO SPEND IT IN THE SECOND HALF

01:28:27.135 --> 01:28:34.843 region:rollup2
OF THE THIRD YEAR. THAT'S NOT

01:28:31.706 --> 01:28:37.612 region:rollup2
THE PRUDENT RESERVE RIGHT THAT'S

01:28:34.843 --> 01:28:45.687 region:rollup2
IN THE MEANTIME IT IT ISN'T

01:28:37.612 --> 01:28:47.255 region:rollup2
THERE A NEED. RIGHT I WAS OUT IN

01:28:45.687 --> 01:28:47.789 region:rollup2
THE EARLY AND IN THE MEANTIME

01:28:47.255 --> 01:29:03.171 region:rollup2
UNTIL THAT'S THE PART YEAH

01:28:47.789 --> 01:29:04.739 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN PARTICULAR

01:29:03.171 --> 01:29:05.974 region:rollup2
SUDDEN COMMUNITIES WHO ARE VERY

01:29:04.739 --> 01:29:07.375 region:rollup2
CONSERVATIVE AS THEY LOOK AT

01:29:05.974 --> 01:29:08.510 region:rollup2
PROJECTIONS AND I KNOW. THE

01:29:07.375 --> 01:29:09.678 region:rollup2
ISSUE OF RAINY DAY FUND IS

01:29:08.510 --> 01:29:11.746 region:rollup2
CONTROVERSIAL EVEN IN THIS

01:29:09.678 --> 01:29:13.148 region:rollup2
BUILDING ABOUT WHETHER WE SPEND

01:29:11.746 --> 01:29:15.217 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE THE REVENUES OR

01:29:13.148 --> 01:29:16.351 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE TAKE A LONG RANGE.

01:29:15.217 --> 01:29:17.752 region:rollup2
PLANNING APPROACH IN PHILIP THE

01:29:16.351 --> 01:29:19.588 region:rollup2
PIGGY BANK I THINK THAT KIND OF

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:21.022 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION DOES HAPPEN IN EACH

01:29:19.588 --> 01:29:22.691 region:rollup2
COUNTY ABOUT HOW CONSERVATIVES

01:29:21.022 --> 01:29:24.059 region:rollup2
ARE GOING TO WANT TO BE. HOWEVER

01:29:22.691 --> 01:29:25.460 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT IT IS REALLY

01:29:24.059 --> 01:29:27.128 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT AND WE DO SUPPORT THE

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:29.764 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT HAS REGULATIONS UNDER

01:29:27.128 --> 01:29:31.099 region:rollup2
WAY THIS VERY SPECIFIC IDEAS

01:29:29.764 --> 01:29:32.934 region:rollup2
ABOUT WHAT WHAT DOES NOT TO

01:29:31.099 --> 01:29:34.035 region:rollup2
INCLUDE BUT. RATHER THAN LOOK AT

01:29:32.934 --> 01:29:36.238 region:rollup2
THE IDEA OF A RESERVE FOR A

01:29:34.035 --> 01:29:38.440 region:rollup2
RAINY DAY NEEDING TO REACH.

01:29:36.238 --> 01:29:39.608 region:rollup2
AT LEAST A CERTAIN LEVEL WE

01:29:38.440 --> 01:29:42.210 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE

01:29:39.608 --> 01:29:44.913 region:rollup2
FLIPPED AND IN FACT THAT THERE

01:29:42.210 --> 01:29:46.915 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE A MAXIMUM FIVE AMOUNT

01:29:44.913 --> 01:29:48.817 region:rollup2
OF A PRUDENT RESERVE SO THAT IN

01:29:46.915 --> 01:29:50.852 region:rollup2
FACT BECAUSE YOU HAVE NEEDS IN

01:29:48.817 --> 01:29:52.921 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY. YEAR YOU'RE

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:54.589 region:rollup2
PROHIBITED REALLY FROM

01:29:52.921 --> 01:29:56.458 region:rollup2
ACCUMULATING MORE REVENUES THAT

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:58.760 region:rollup2
WOULD BE NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN

01:29:56.458 --> 01:29:58.994 region:rollup2
YOUR OPERATION SAY FOR SIX

01:29:58.760 --> 01:29:59.694 region:rollup2
MONTHS.

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:01.363 region:rollup2
AND THAT THAT WE WOULD BE VERY

01:29:59.694 --> 01:30:03.231 region:rollup2
SUPPORTIVE OF SOMETHING THAT

01:30:01.363 --> 01:30:04.666 region:rollup2
WOULD PLACE SEVEN POUND CEILING

01:30:03.231 --> 01:30:07.002 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN A FLOOR. AT YOUR

01:30:04.666 --> 01:30:08.637 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO MAINTAIN PROGRAMMING

01:30:07.002 --> 01:30:10.805 region:rollup2
AND HAVE YOU KNOW THAT CRITICAL

01:30:08.637 --> 01:30:12.007 region:rollup2
SERVICES CONTINUE IF THERE IS OF

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:14.242 region:rollup2
A DIP IN THE REVENUE IN THERE

01:30:12.007 --> 01:30:15.443 region:rollup2
ARE IN FACT VERY VOLATILE YEARS

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.544 region:rollup2
I THINK FINANCE COULD ATTEST TO

01:30:15.443 --> 01:30:18.880 region:rollup2
THIS THERE HAVE BEEN YEARS IN

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:19.681 region:rollup2
WHICH. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE HAS

01:30:18.880 --> 01:30:21.116 region:rollup2
STEPPED TO HIS MUCH AS THIRTY

01:30:19.681 --> 01:30:22.884 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT BELOW WHAT IT WAS

01:30:21.116 --> 01:30:24.085 region:rollup2
THE PRIOR YEAR SO THOSE KINDS OF

01:30:22.884 --> 01:30:26.054 region:rollup2
THINGS SCARE.

01:30:24.085 --> 01:30:27.589 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENT AND AND WE DO WANT

01:30:26.054 --> 01:30:29.057 region:rollup2
TO BE PREPARED FOR THOSE THINGS

01:30:27.589 --> 01:30:31.393 region:rollup2
BUT WE DO FULLY AGREE THAT.

01:30:29.057 --> 01:30:32.460 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE THE ABILITY

01:30:31.393 --> 01:30:34.629 region:rollup2
TO ANSWER TO LOCAL.

01:30:32.460 --> 01:30:36.097 region:rollup2
SITUATIONS WHERE PERHAPS

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:37.832 region:rollup2
REVENUES IN OTHER AREAS DROPS OR

01:30:36.097 --> 01:30:39.434 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMUNITY EXTREMELY

01:30:37.832 --> 01:30:40.802 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY HOMELESS BUT EVEN

01:30:39.434 --> 01:30:42.771 region:rollup2
USING YOUR EXAMPLE OF A THIRTY

01:30:40.802 --> 01:30:44.506 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT DECREASE WHICH WAS

01:30:42.771 --> 01:30:47.042 region:rollup2
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT WE'VE SEEN

01:30:44.506 --> 01:30:48.310 region:rollup2
IN ANY ONE YEAR. THAT DOESN'T

01:30:47.042 --> 01:30:51.112 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN HOLDING TWO AND A HALF

01:30:48.310 --> 01:30:53.715 region:rollup2
YEARS WORTH OF FUNDS.

01:30:51.112 --> 01:30:54.316 region:rollup2
IN RESERVE WHEN THERE IS AS MUCH

01:30:53.715 --> 01:30:54.983 region:rollup2
NEED AS WE HAVE AND WE WOULD

01:30:54.316 --> 01:30:55.583 region:rollup2
AGREE WITH THAT AND SO WE WE

01:30:54.983 --> 01:30:57.519 region:rollup2
AGREE THERE IS A NEED FOR A

01:30:55.583 --> 01:30:59.788 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE STANDARD. THAT

01:30:57.519 --> 01:31:01.156 region:rollup2
CLARIFIES WHAT THE PURPOSE OF A

01:30:59.788 --> 01:31:02.624 region:rollup2
RESERVIST BECAUSE THE ACT

01:31:01.156 --> 01:31:04.392 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAS THREE DIFFERENT

01:31:02.624 --> 01:31:06.328 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTIONS OF WHAT THE

01:31:04.392 --> 01:31:07.495 region:rollup2
RESERVISTS FLOOR AND WHEN YOU

01:31:06.328 --> 01:31:09.597 region:rollup2
CAN USE IT WE NEED TO CLEAN

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:11.366 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS THAT. WE ALSO NEED

01:31:09.597 --> 01:31:13.268 region:rollup2
TO CLARIFY REALLY WHAT'S

01:31:11.366 --> 01:31:15.470 region:rollup2
REASONABLE WHAT CAN PASS THE

01:31:13.268 --> 01:31:16.705 region:rollup2
SMELL TEST BETWEEN WE WANT TO

01:31:15.470 --> 01:31:17.772 region:rollup2
HAVE LONG RANGE PLANNING WE

01:31:16.705 --> 01:31:20.275 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO PULL THE RUG OUT

01:31:17.772 --> 01:31:21.943 region:rollup2
FROM UNDER CRITICAL SERVICES.

01:31:20.275 --> 01:31:23.511 region:rollup2
HOWEVER AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T

01:31:21.943 --> 01:31:25.613 region:rollup2
WANT PEOPLE TO A MASS DOLLARS

01:31:23.511 --> 01:31:26.915 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE USED FOR VERY

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:29.684 region:rollup2
CRITICAL NEED MY PROBLEM WITH

01:31:26.915 --> 01:31:32.754 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHERE THE MENTAL HEALTH.

01:31:29.684 --> 01:31:35.290 region:rollup2
A. ISSUES IS IN THAT UP A CRISIS

01:31:32.754 --> 01:31:36.524 region:rollup2
MODE IT'S NOT LIKE OH YOU KNOW

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:38.760 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A FEW PEOPLE HERE IT'S.

01:31:36.524 --> 01:31:40.562 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE A CRISIS IN OUR HANDS

01:31:38.760 --> 01:31:42.664 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT WHERE DOES LIKE A

01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:42.864 region:rollup2
REGULAR PERSON SATAN YOU KNOW

01:31:42.664 --> 01:31:45.333 region:rollup2
WHAT.

01:31:42.864 --> 01:31:47.035 region:rollup2
YES I A LONG TERM PLANNING BUT

01:31:45.333 --> 01:31:48.570 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE CRISIS WE HAVE FOR

01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:50.238 region:rollup2
EXAMPLE ORANGE COUNTY WHERE I AM

01:31:48.570 --> 01:31:53.808 region:rollup2
IN MY COUNTY WHERE WE'RE HAVING

01:31:50.238 --> 01:31:54.476 region:rollup2
A CRISIS OF MENTAL HEALTH. A.

01:31:53.808 --> 01:31:55.810 region:rollup2
I DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT TO CALL

01:31:54.476 --> 01:31:58.279 region:rollup2
IT OF OF FOLKS WITH MENTAL

01:31:55.810 --> 01:32:00.081 region:rollup2
HEALTH ISSUES AT WHAT POINT DOES

01:31:58.279 --> 01:32:02.016 region:rollup2
A REGULAR PERSON GOAL. I GET ALL

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:03.351 region:rollup2
OF THAT BUT LOOK AT THE CRISIS

01:32:02.016 --> 01:32:04.519 region:rollup2
AND LET'S.

01:32:03.351 --> 01:32:06.788 region:rollup2
TRY TO.

01:32:04.519 --> 01:32:08.556 region:rollup2
I'M FRUSTRATED I'M FRUSTRATED

01:32:06.788 --> 01:32:10.091 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S NOT CARS THAT WERE

01:32:08.556 --> 01:32:11.426 region:rollup2
BUILDING IT'S PEOPLE'S LIVES

01:32:10.091 --> 01:32:12.727 region:rollup2
THAT WERE PLAYING WITH AND AND

01:32:11.426 --> 01:32:14.496 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE NOT PUTTING THAT MONEY

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:16.498 region:rollup2
IN THOSE SERVICES WERE AFFECTING

01:32:14.496 --> 01:32:18.533 region:rollup2
NOT JUST THAT PERSON'S LIFE BUT

01:32:16.498 --> 01:32:20.969 region:rollup2
THEIR FAMILIES. BUT COUNTIES THE

01:32:18.533 --> 01:32:22.604 region:rollup2
CITIES AND WE SIT BACK AND GOAL

01:32:20.969 --> 01:32:24.439 region:rollup2
PULL MY GOT BACK CRISIS OF THAT

01:32:22.604 --> 01:32:26.041 region:rollup2
HAPPENING IN ORANGE COUNTY POOR

01:32:24.439 --> 01:32:27.175 region:rollup2
PEOPLE BY YEAR WERE SITTING ON.

01:32:26.041 --> 01:32:28.843 region:rollup2
A OF MONEY THAT COULD BE USED

01:32:27.175 --> 01:32:30.478 region:rollup2
FOR THAT FOR THAT AND I THINK

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:31.713 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO

01:32:30.478 --> 01:32:32.680 region:rollup2
REALLY THINK THROUGH THE

01:32:31.713 --> 01:32:34.349 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES AND THAT'S YOU KNOW

01:32:32.680 --> 01:32:35.483 region:rollup2
IT'S EASY. WE'VE SEEN A COUPLE

01:32:34.349 --> 01:32:37.252 region:rollup2
OF NEWS STORIES TALK ABOUT

01:32:35.483 --> 01:32:39.487 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON MONEY I

01:32:37.252 --> 01:32:41.189 region:rollup2
THINK WERE WE TO LOOK AT OUR OWN

01:32:39.487 --> 01:32:42.957 region:rollup2
STATE BUDGET YOU COULD WRITE THE

01:32:41.189 --> 01:32:44.325 region:rollup2
SAME HEADLINE IF WE WANTED TO

01:32:42.957 --> 01:32:46.027 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PICK APART THE VALIDITY

01:32:44.325 --> 01:32:47.729 region:rollup2
OF HAVING A RAINY DAY FUND. THAT

01:32:46.027 --> 01:32:49.364 region:rollup2
WERE SITTING ON MONEY AND YET WE

01:32:47.729 --> 01:32:51.332 region:rollup2
HAVE NEEDS IN OUR STATE I THINK

01:32:49.364 --> 01:32:53.068 region:rollup2
WE DO NEED TO DEFINITELY CLEAR

01:32:51.332 --> 01:32:56.504 region:rollup2
UP WHAT A REASONABLE PRINT

01:32:53.068 --> 01:32:58.873 region:rollup2
RESERVE WOULD BE. WHETHER WE

01:32:56.504 --> 01:33:00.575 region:rollup2
SHOULD HAVE ONE ABOUT AYE NOT

01:32:58.873 --> 01:33:02.777 region:rollup2
JUST OUR LITTLE BUT IT'S NOT

01:33:00.575 --> 01:33:04.279 region:rollup2
JUST THE RESERVE YOU'RE SAYING

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:05.180 region:rollup2
THERE'S TO DO RIGHT SHUT THAT TO

01:33:04.279 --> 01:33:07.715 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT THERE ARE

01:33:05.180 --> 01:33:09.517 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WITH THIS UNSPENT MONEY

01:33:07.715 --> 01:33:11.686 region:rollup2
I THINK I. TOBY MENTIONED.

01:33:09.517 --> 01:33:14.389 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:33:11.686 --> 01:33:16.624 region:rollup2
THAT WERE KIND OF PILED UP

01:33:14.389 --> 01:33:18.860 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE STATE DEPARTMENT A

01:33:16.624 --> 01:33:22.464 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH FOLLOWED BY D. H.

01:33:18.860 --> 01:33:24.132 region:rollup2
CS DID NOT. ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT

01:33:22.464 --> 01:33:26.101 region:rollup2
STATUTE WHICH WAS THAT TO THE

01:33:24.132 --> 01:33:27.902 region:rollup2
EXTENT COUNTIES COULDN'T SPEND

01:33:26.101 --> 01:33:30.038 region:rollup2
TIMELY THOSE DOLLARS WOULD GET

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:32.040 region:rollup2
REVERTED THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN

01:33:30.038 --> 01:33:34.409 region:rollup2
SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT. SO

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:36.344 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE ON IN

01:33:34.409 --> 01:33:38.179 region:rollup2
COLLABORATION WITH COUNTIES AND

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:42.884 region:rollup2
OTHERS WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:47.856 region:rollup2
A ONE TIME MECHANISM TO LOOK

01:33:42.884 --> 01:33:50.158 region:rollup2
HERE INVEST THOSE GOD IS IN THAT

01:33:47.856 --> 01:33:53.128 region:rollup2
WERE WET. WE GET UP WITH IT HE

01:33:50.158 --> 01:33:56.631 region:rollup2
LEARN THE PROCESS OF

01:33:53.128 --> 01:33:58.600 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTING THAT PEACE AND

01:33:56.631 --> 01:34:00.735 region:rollup2
HOPEFULLY GOING FORWARD WE DON'T

01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:01.336 region:rollup2
WIND UP HAVING THE SAME

01:34:00.735 --> 01:34:08.009 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND WE WOULD LIKE

01:34:01.336 --> 01:34:10.078 region:rollup2
TO SEE THE

01:34:08.009 --> 01:34:12.447 region:rollup2
OASES CHO TO FINISH ITS WORK

01:34:10.078 --> 01:34:13.515 region:rollup2
THAT IT STARTED A YEAR SO AGO.

01:34:12.447 --> 01:34:14.749 region:rollup2
I'M TO LOOK AT THE INNOVATION

01:34:13.515 --> 01:34:15.950 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES THOSE JUST GOT

01:34:14.749 --> 01:34:16.885 region:rollup2
PUBLISHED IN REGULATION.

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:19.354 region:rollup2
IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

01:34:16.885 --> 01:34:21.289 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN SO WE'VE HAD JUST NOW A

01:34:19.354 --> 01:34:23.458 region:rollup2
NEW SET OF REQUIREMENTS TO BEGIN

01:34:21.289 --> 01:34:25.426 region:rollup2
TO IMPLEMENT AND PUT PROGRAMS

01:34:23.458 --> 01:34:27.729 region:rollup2
FOURTH TO THE OAC TO HAVE THOSE

01:34:25.426 --> 01:34:30.765 region:rollup2
INNOVATION DOLLARS CAN EXPAND IT

01:34:27.729 --> 01:34:33.001 region:rollup2
SO. I THINK WERE WERE HOPING

01:34:30.765 --> 01:34:35.370 region:rollup2
THAT ON THE AUDIT IN THE FIRE

01:34:33.001 --> 01:34:38.172 region:rollup2

DOT ONLY THE STATE AGENCIES BUT

01:34:38.172 --> 01:34:42.210 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY THE COUNTIES AROUND

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:45.280 region:rollup2
THESE ISSUES THAT WE ARE PUTTING

AND WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR

01:34:53.188 --> 01:34:56.624 region:rollup2
ALMOST AN HOUR SOIL I'LL STOP ON

01:34:54.522 --> 01:34:58.293 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE SHORTLY BUT JUST A FEW

01:34:56.624 --> 01:34:59.694 region:rollup2
MORE OVERVIEWS IF I CAN.

01:34:58.293 --> 01:35:03.298 region:rollup2
DONE.

01:34:59.694 --> 01:35:04.499 region:rollup2
QUESTION SIX I FOUND THEM

01:35:11.439 --> 01:35:15.577 region:rollup2
DEEM CRITICAL PERFORMANCE

01:35:12.607 --> 01:35:16.844 region:rollup2
ISSUES.

01:35:15.577 --> 01:35:18.012 region:rollup2
HAS D. H. CS RECEIVED ANY OF

01:35:16.844 --> 01:35:18.713 region:rollup2
THESE NOTIFICATIONS AND WHAT

THAT AND WE HAVE HAD ONE.

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:27.322 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS INVOLVING AND COUNTY

01:35:24.352 --> 01:35:29.757 region:rollup2
THAT HAD USED MHSAA FUNDS FOR A

01:35:27.322 --> 01:35:30.525 region:rollup2
NON MHSAA PURPOSE.

01:35:29.757 --> 01:35:31.359 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE RECEIVE.

01:35:30.525 --> 01:35:32.860 region:rollup2
.

01:35:31.359 --> 01:35:34.429 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE THAT WE GO TO THE

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:36.197 region:rollup2
COUNTY WE'D DO I WOULD.

01:35:34.429 --> 01:35:37.832 region:rollup2
I'D.

01:35:36.197 --> 01:35:38.1000 region:rollup2
DON'T TAKE INVESTIGATION AS A

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:40.268 region:rollup2
KIND OF A LAW ENFORCEMENT TYPE

01:35:38.1000 --> 01:35:41.970 region:rollup2
OF INVESTIGATION BUT.

01:35:40.268 --> 01:35:43.805 region:rollup2
WE WOULD GO OUT TO THE COUNTY

01:35:41.970 --> 01:35:44.405 region:rollup2
AND WE WOULD KNOW WHETHER OR NOT

01:35:43.805 --> 01:35:46.441 region:rollup2
THAT WAS ACTUALLY UNSUPPORTED

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:48.176 region:rollup2
BY.

01:35:46.441 --> 01:35:49.944 region:rollup2
WHAT THEY HAD EXPENDED THE FUNDS

01:35:48.176 --> 01:35:50.878 region:rollup2
ON AND THEN WE WORK WITH THEM TO

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:52.747 region:rollup2
LET THEM KNOW THAT THEY CAN DO

01:35:50.878 --> 01:35:54.015 region:rollup2
THAT? THEY HAVE TO THEN BACK OUT

01:35:52.747 --> 01:35:55.984 region:rollup2
THE EITHER EXPENDITURE THEY HAVE

01:35:54.015 --> 01:35:57.885 region:rollup2
TO PAY WITH DIFFERENT FUNDS ARE

01:35:55.984 --> 01:35:58.486 region:rollup2
REPLACE THE FUNDS THAT THEY

01:35:57.885 --> 01:35:59.320 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE USE BUT THERE'S ONLY

01:35:58.486 --> 01:36:01.623 region:rollup2
BEEN ONE.

01:35:59.320 --> 01:36:02.991 region:rollup2
COME LET ME THEN TRANSITION TO

01:36:01.623 --> 01:36:05.693 region:rollup2
THE NEXT QUESTION.

01:36:02.991 --> 01:36:08.129 region:rollup2
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS OF.

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:10.064 region:rollup2
INTEREST.

01:36:08.129 --> 01:36:13.167 region:rollup2
WHO WHAT'S THE PLAN WITH THAT

01:36:10.064 --> 01:36:14.636 region:rollup2
WHAT'S OUR ROLE AS A STATE AND?

01:36:13.167 --> 01:36:17.071 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TO TRACK

01:36:14.636 --> 01:36:18.740 region:rollup2
THAT SO WE CONSISTENT WITH THAT

01:36:17.071 --> 01:36:20.642 region:rollup2
INFORMATION NOTICE THAT WESENT

01:36:18.740 --> 01:36:21.809 region:rollup2
OUT TO THE COUNTIES WE HAVE TOLD

01:36:20.642 --> 01:36:23.811 region:rollup2
THEM THAT THE INTEREST?

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:25.647 region:rollup2
IN WHICHEVER ACCOUNT THAT IT'S

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:27.649 region:rollup2
ACCRUING ON HOUSE TO BE SPENT

01:36:25.647 --> 01:36:28.616 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THAT

01:36:27.649 --> 01:36:29.984 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS WOULD OTHERWISE BE

01:36:28.616 --> 01:36:32.220 region:rollup2
YOU SO IF YOU'RE EARNING

01:36:29.984 --> 01:36:34.122 region:rollup2
INTEREST ON YOUR. PREVENTION AND

01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:35.089 region:rollup2
EARLY INTERVENTION ALLOCATION

01:36:34.122 --> 01:36:36.624 region:rollup2
THE INTEREST THAT ACCRUES TO THE

01:36:35.089 --> 01:36:38.626 region:rollup2
HOUSE WE USE IN PREVENTION AND

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:39.360 region:rollup2
EARLY INTERVENTION EFFORTS

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:40.962 region:rollup2
INTEREST THAT IS.

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.629 region:rollup2
GARNERED ON THE INNOVATION

01:36:40.962 --> 01:36:43.798 region:rollup2
FUNDS AND YOU HAVE TO USE IT FOR

01:36:41.629 --> 01:36:45.133 region:rollup2
YOUR INNOVATION SO THAT WE

01:36:43.798 --> 01:36:47.101 region:rollup2
ISSUED GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTIES

01:36:45.133 --> 01:36:48.536 region:rollup2
AND LETTING THEM KNOW HOW TO

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:49.570 region:rollup2
HANDLE THAT INTERESTS.

01:36:48.536 --> 01:36:50.838 region:rollup2
I'M I'M GONNA ASK A QUESTION

01:36:49.570 --> 01:36:52.707 region:rollup2
THAT'S QUITE DETAILED AND I'M

01:36:50.838 --> 01:36:53.841 region:rollup2
SORRY IF I LOSE ANYONE BUT I'M

01:36:52.707 --> 01:36:55.443 region:rollup2
TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IT AND I

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:56.044 region:rollup2
DON'T FULLY GET IT.

01:36:55.443 --> 01:36:59.280 region:rollup2
SO IF.

01:36:56.044 --> 01:37:01.416 region:rollup2
FISCAL YEAR ONE TWO THREE.

01:36:59.280 --> 01:37:02.917 region:rollup2
COME FISCAL YEAR TWO YOU WANT TO

01:37:01.416 --> 01:37:05.486 region:rollup2
CHANGE YOUR THREE YEAR PLAN TO

01:37:02.917 --> 01:37:07.221 region:rollup2
MAKE IT TWO THREE FOUR.

01:37:05.486 --> 01:37:09.924 region:rollup2
DO THE PERCENTAGES THAT YOU'VE

01:37:07.221 --> 01:37:12.994 region:rollup2
SPENT IN EACH INDIVIDUAL AREA

01:37:09.924 --> 01:37:15.463 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE. ACCURATE.

01:37:12.994 --> 01:37:17.799 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU HAD SPEND EIGHTY

01:37:15.463 --> 01:37:20.234 region:rollup2
PERCENT ON COMMUNITY SERVICE AS

01:37:17.799 --> 01:37:22.704 region:rollup2
AN TWENTY PERCENT ON INNOVATION

ARE THOSE TRANSFERABLE. TO THE

01:37:22.704 --> 01:37:26.574 region:rollup2
NEXT CONTRACTOR HOW DO WE ENSURE

01:37:25.206 --> 01:37:27.775 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SPENDING

01:37:26.574 --> 01:37:29.610 region:rollup2
TWENTY PERCENT ON EARLY

01:37:27.775 --> 01:37:30.812 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION. BECAUSE IT SEEMS

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:32.880 region:rollup2
LIKE.

01:37:30.812 --> 01:37:34.582 region:rollup2
WE KICKED THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD

01:37:32.880 --> 01:37:36.584 region:rollup2
ON ACTUALLY PREVENTING DISEASE.

01:37:34.582 --> 01:37:37.552 region:rollup2
THAT THE POINT OF THIS IS THE

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.753 region:rollup2
EARLY INTERVENTION AND

01:37:37.552 --> 01:37:40.822 region:rollup2
PREVENTION AND THAT WE NEVER

01:37:38.753 --> 01:37:41.889 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVELY SPEND THOSE DOLLARS.

01:37:40.822 --> 01:37:43.257 region:rollup2
SO HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT WE'RE

01:37:41.889 --> 01:37:45.993 region:rollup2
SPENDING AT A MINIMUM TWENTY

01:37:43.257 --> 01:37:48.563 region:rollup2
PERCENT AS DESIGNED IN STATUTE.

01:37:45.993 --> 01:37:50.565 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT EASIEST WAY

01:37:48.563 --> 01:37:51.833 region:rollup2
I ACCORDING TO. BRENDA IS ITS

01:37:50.565 --> 01:37:53.434 region:rollup2
FIRST AND.

01:37:51.833 --> 01:37:55.903 region:rollup2
FIRST OUT

01:37:53.434 --> 01:37:58.840 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU GET ALLEN ALLOCATION

01:37:55.903 --> 01:38:00.241 region:rollup2
AND TWENTY FIFTEEN SAY AND.

01:37:58.840 --> 01:38:01.576 region:rollup2
TO MAKE MATH EASY LET'S SAY IT'S

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:03.144 region:rollup2
A MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

01:38:01.576 --> 01:38:04.579 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

01:38:03.144 --> 01:38:07.315 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT.

01:38:04.579 --> 01:38:10.251 region:rollup2
HALF A MILLION AND PNI AND HALF

01:38:07.315 --> 01:38:10.852 region:rollup2
A MILLION INNOVATION THOSE

01:38:10.251 --> 01:38:11.052 region:rollup2
NUMBERS ARE RIGHT BUT DISTRICT

01:38:10.852 --> 01:38:11.853 region:rollup2
MAP.

01:38:11.052 --> 01:38:13.187 region:rollup2
.

01:38:11.853 --> 01:38:14.489 region:rollup2
MENU EXPEND ALL OF YOUR

01:38:13.187 --> 01:38:16.491 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY SERVICES AND SUPPORTS

01:38:14.489 --> 01:38:18.359 region:rollup2
YOU SPENT MILLION DOLLARS HE

01:38:16.491 --> 01:38:20.161 region:rollup2
SPENT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY.

01:38:18.359 --> 01:38:22.530 region:rollup2
A THOUSAND OF THE FIVE HUNDRED

01:38:20.161 --> 01:38:23.898 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND PNI AND YOU SPENT

01:38:22.530 --> 01:38:25.533 region:rollup2
TWO HUNDRED FIFTEEN INNOVATION.

01:38:23.898 --> 01:38:27.335 region:rollup2
AND YOU COME BACK AND SAY I

01:38:25.533 --> 01:38:28.403 region:rollup2
WANT TO USE THOSE REMAINING TO

01:38:27.335 --> 01:38:30.037 region:rollup2
AMOUNTS OF TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

01:38:28.403 --> 01:38:32.039 region:rollup2
THOUSAND AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS

01:38:30.037 --> 01:38:34.175 region:rollup2
AND SERVICES. YOU CAN'T WRITE

01:38:32.039 --> 01:38:35.743 region:rollup2
YOU CAN ROLL IT INTO THOSE

01:38:34.175 --> 01:38:37.211 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTS FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND

01:38:35.743 --> 01:38:38.846 region:rollup2
SOME COUNTIES MAY DO THAT RIGHT

01:38:37.211 --> 01:38:40.081 region:rollup2
SO IF YOU GET ONLY.

01:38:38.846 --> 01:38:41.582 region:rollup2
SOME CAN EASILY GET LIKE A

01:38:40.081 --> 01:38:42.683 region:rollup2
HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND

01:38:41.582 --> 01:38:43.785 region:rollup2
DOLLARS IN INNOVATION FUNDS IN A

01:38:42.683 --> 01:38:45.119 region:rollup2
SINGLE YEAR THE VERY SMALL IN

01:38:43.785 --> 01:38:46.988 region:rollup2
YOU CAN DO A LOT WITHOUT AND SO

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:48.489 region:rollup2
THEY MAY SET ON INNOVATION FUNDS

01:38:46.988 --> 01:38:49.957 region:rollup2
FOR. A COUPLE OF YEARS TO KIND

01:38:48.489 --> 01:38:51.659 region:rollup2
OF BUILD UP AN AMOUNT AND THEN

01:38:49.957 --> 01:38:53.628 region:rollup2
COME AND SAY TO THE COMMISSION

01:38:51.659 --> 01:38:55.363 region:rollup2
WE'D LIKE TO USE. THREE HUNDRED

01:38:53.628 --> 01:38:56.230 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR INNOVATION

01:38:55.363 --> 01:38:56.731 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS HOW WE WOULD USE

01:38:56.230 --> 01:38:59.600 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:38:56.731 --> 01:39:01.369 region:rollup2
BUT YOU DON'T GET TO COME BACK

01:38:59.600 --> 01:39:03.104 region:rollup2
AND RE ALLOCATE YOURSELF INTO IT

01:39:01.369 --> 01:39:04.005 region:rollup2
A DIFFERENT ACCOUNT JUST BECAUSE

01:39:03.104 --> 01:39:05.573 region:rollup2
YOU DIDN'T USE FUNDS.

01:39:04.005 --> 01:39:06.607 region:rollup2
SO THEY STAYED PRETTY MUCH IN

01:39:05.573 --> 01:39:08.976 region:rollup2
THAT ACCOUNT THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:39:06.607 --> 01:39:09.811 region:rollup2
DESIGNATED.

01:39:08.976 --> 01:39:12.213 region:rollup2
SO IS THERE.

01:39:09.811 --> 01:39:14.715 region:rollup2
CAN WE GET AN ANALYSIS OF.

01:39:12.213 --> 01:39:16.584 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY ARE IN THOSE SPECIFIC

01:39:14.715 --> 01:39:19.220 region:rollup2
POOLS OF MONEY THEN SO THAT WE

01:39:16.584 --> 01:39:21.255 region:rollup2
CAN THEN ANALYZE?

01:39:19.220 --> 01:39:23.090 region:rollup2
HOW TO HELP TO INCENTIVIZE

01:39:21.255 --> 01:39:25.092 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE DECISION MAKING BY

01:39:23.090 --> 01:39:26.527 region:rollup2
THE COUNTY SO THAT? THEY'RE

01:39:25.092 --> 01:39:29.630 region:rollup2
SPENDING THE FUNDS HAS.

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:31.199 region:rollup2
INDICATED.

01:39:29.630 --> 01:39:32.834 region:rollup2
DO YOU.

01:39:31.199 --> 01:39:34.635 region:rollup2
YES SO I'M LOOKING AT EITHER

01:39:32.834 --> 01:39:37.271 region:rollup2
FINANCE THEIR EACH COUNTY THAT

01:39:34.635 --> 01:39:39.006 region:rollup2
HAS BALANCES.

01:39:37.271 --> 01:39:41.175 region:rollup2
OUTSTANDING BALANCES AND.

01:39:39.006 --> 01:39:42.777 region:rollup2
PNI AND INNOVATION BROKEN DOWN

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:45.746 region:rollup2
BY COUNTY IS THAT PART OF THE

01:39:42.777 --> 01:39:46.914 region:rollup2
STATE COMPTROLLER'S NO CONCERN

01:39:45.746 --> 01:39:48.549 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING OUT TO COUNTY

01:39:46.914 --> 01:39:51.786 region:rollup2
THOUGH AND THEN WHAT WHEN THE

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:53.054 region:rollup2
CLOCK STARTS FOR. EACH OF THOSE

01:39:51.786 --> 01:39:54.956 region:rollup2
FARMS AND THEN THEY HAVE TO

01:39:53.054 --> 01:39:56.991 region:rollup2
SPEND THOSE MONIES WHICH AND

01:39:54.956 --> 01:39:57.792 region:rollup2
WITHIN THE HOUR YEAH TIME FRAMES

01:39:56.991 --> 01:39:58.593 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AND THEY HAVE AND THEY

01:39:57.792 --> 01:40:00.962 region:rollup2
HAVE TO STAY WITHIN THE

01:39:58.593 --> 01:40:05.499 region:rollup2
COMPONENTS SO. YOU CAN'T SHIFT

01:40:00.962 --> 01:40:11.472 region:rollup2
FROM ONE COMPONENT TO ANOTHER SO

01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:13.774 region:rollup2
IT CAME INTO ONE COMPONENT

01:40:11.472 --> 01:40:17.011 region:rollup2
THAT'S EVEN WITH AB ONE FOR TO.

01:40:13.774 --> 01:40:18.779 region:rollup2
GET THREE ALLOCATED CERTAIN SO

01:40:17.011 --> 01:40:22.917 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S REALLY KIND OF A VALUE

01:40:18.779 --> 01:40:27.321 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT'S BEEN HELD ACROSS

01:40:22.917 --> 01:40:28.990 region:rollup2
ON MHSAA IS TERRIFIC. IF

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:34.028 region:rollup2
SOMETHING GOES OUT ORIGINALLY IN

01:40:28.990 --> 01:40:35.496 region:rollup2
A PARTICULAR COMPONENT IT STAYS

01:40:34.028 --> 01:40:37.231 region:rollup2
IN THAT PROPONENTS.

01:40:35.496 --> 01:40:40.167 region:rollup2
TOOK MISTER CHAIR. YOU KNOW YEAH

01:40:37.231 --> 01:40:41.836 region:rollup2
IT JUST KIND OF.

01:40:40.167 --> 01:40:42.436 region:rollup2
GOING UP WEBER ANNA ANNA SAID.

01:40:41.836 --> 01:40:51.712 region:rollup2
SCREENSHOT I THINK THE PROBLEM

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:52.914 region:rollup2
WITH THE

01:40:51.712 --> 01:40:54.582 region:rollup2
FACT THAT.

01:40:52.914 --> 01:40:56.450 region:rollup2
WHERE'S OUR OVERSIGHT.

01:40:54.582 --> 01:41:01.088 region:rollup2
AND ACCOUNTABILITY IF THE ONLY

01:40:56.450 --> 01:41:03.291 region:rollup2
THING WE SEE IS MONEY GOING OUT

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:04.725 region:rollup2
OF OUR ACCOUNT AND NOT WE SEE

01:41:03.291 --> 01:41:07.495 region:rollup2
THE FUNDS THAT ARE EXPENDED

01:41:04.725 --> 01:41:10.298 region:rollup2
AFTER THE COUNTY HAS EXPANDED

01:41:07.495 --> 01:41:15.436 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE THEY FILE THOSE

01:41:10.298 --> 01:41:20.908 region:rollup2
REPORTS WITH US SO I NOTHING ON

01:41:15.436 --> 01:41:31.719 region:rollup2
RETIRED MAYBE EVERY YASHA AND

01:41:20.908 --> 01:41:33.154 region:rollup2
THAT. SUMMER DELAY I'M AROUND.

01:41:31.719 --> 01:41:33.854 region:rollup2
MISTER CHAIR IF I MAY IS SO YOU

01:41:33.154 --> 01:41:35.056 region:rollup2
KNOW YOUR REFERENCE TO THE

01:41:33.854 --> 01:41:35.423 region:rollup2
REFERRALS FROM THE COMMISSION TO

01:41:35.056 --> 01:41:35.790 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT.

01:41:35.423 --> 01:41:36.424 region:rollup2
.

01:41:35.790 --> 01:41:37.925 region:rollup2
THE THAT'S THAT'S RECOGNIZING

01:41:36.424 --> 01:41:40.361 region:rollup2
THAT THE COMMISSION DOES NOT

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:42.597 region:rollup2
HAVE AUDIT CAPACITY OR AUTHORITY

01:41:40.361 --> 01:41:43.331 region:rollup2
RIGHT BUT THAT'S NOT THAT'S NOT

01:41:42.597 --> 01:41:43.965 region:rollup2
HOWEVER SANTA.

01:41:43.331 --> 01:41:44.465 region:rollup2
SO IT'S TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

01:41:43.965 --> 01:41:44.999 region:rollup2
COMMISSION IDENTIFIES A

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:59.447 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE COUNTY THAT WAS

01:41:44.999 --> 01:42:08.289 region:rollup2
SOMEWHAT

01:41:59.447 --> 01:42:24.438 region:rollup2
HUMOROUS AND DISAPPOINTING. M.

01:42:08.289 --> 01:42:24.438 region:rollup2
THAT THEM

01:42:32.580 --> 01:42:34.982 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME CHALLENGES THERE

01:42:33.314 --> 01:42:36.183 region:rollup2
THERE ARE LOTS OF FISCAL

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:37.318 region:rollup2
PRACTICES THAT NEED TO BE

01:42:36.183 --> 01:42:39.487 region:rollup2
TIGHTENED UP IN TERMS OF

01:42:37.318 --> 01:42:40.021 region:rollup2
ENSURING THAT A HUNDRED PERCENT

01:42:39.487 --> 01:42:42.023 region:rollup2
OF THE MONEY DISPENSED GOT

01:42:40.021 --> 01:42:43.057 region:rollup2
INNOVATION. IS ACTUALLY GOING TO

01:42:42.023 --> 01:42:43.557 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION'S APPROVAL

01:42:43.057 --> 01:42:45.359 region:rollup2
PROCESS I MEAN DEDICATED

01:42:43.557 --> 01:42:45.993 region:rollup2
INNOVATION.

01:42:45.359 --> 01:42:47.828 region:rollup2
THE PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:49.463 region:rollup2
IS MUCH MORE DIFFICULT IN TERMS

01:42:47.828 --> 01:42:51.465 region:rollup2
OF BEING ABLE TO TRACK THAT.

01:42:49.463 --> 01:42:52.633 region:rollup2
BOTH IN TERMS OF EXPENDITURES

01:42:51.465 --> 01:42:54.568 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO A PROGRAMMATIC LEVEL

01:42:52.633 --> 01:42:55.536 region:rollup2
YOUR QUESTION IS HOW DO WE KNOW

01:42:54.568 --> 01:42:57.138 region:rollup2
THAT THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT

01:42:55.536 --> 01:42:58.072 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEST TO BE SPENT ON.

01:42:57.138 --> 01:42:59.640 region:rollup2
AT AND THEN PART OF THAT IS IS

01:42:58.072 --> 01:43:01.108 region:rollup2
IT ACTUALLY IMPACTFUL.

01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:02.543 region:rollup2
THAT'S YOU KNOW OUR OUR OUR

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:03.711 region:rollup2
STRATEGY IN THE LIMITED

01:43:02.543 --> 01:43:06.414 region:rollup2
AUTHORITY RESOURCES WE HAVE

01:43:03.711 --> 01:43:07.515 region:rollup2
REALLY IS TO PUT THE REPORTS OF

01:43:06.414 --> 01:43:08.816 region:rollup2
THE KINDS OF REPAIRING ONLINE

01:43:07.515 --> 01:43:09.750 region:rollup2
LET PEOPLE SEE THEM.

01:43:08.816 --> 01:43:11.252 region:rollup2
AND RELEASED TRIED TO SUPPORT

01:43:09.750 --> 01:43:12.686 region:rollup2
THAT BROAD LEVEL OF PUBLIC

01:43:11.252 --> 01:43:13.921 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND THEN TO DO

01:43:12.686 --> 01:43:15.956 region:rollup2
THE DATA LINKING AND AND THE

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:17.491 region:rollup2
IDEA THERE. IS TO REALLY HELP

01:43:15.956 --> 01:43:19.093 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC UNDERSTAND TO THE

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:19.927 region:rollup2
EXTENT THAT THE PROGRAMS ARE

01:43:19.093 --> 01:43:21.762 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL WITH THE GOALS THAT

01:43:19.927 --> 01:43:24.498 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED IN THE ACT. BUT BUT

01:43:21.762 --> 01:43:25.399 region:rollup2
WE DO DEPEND ON THE ABILITY OF

01:43:24.498 --> 01:43:26.667 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT TO DO THE AUDITS

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:28.736 region:rollup2
IN THE REVIEWS BECAUSE THAT

01:43:26.667 --> 01:43:29.737 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT. THAT

01:43:28.736 --> 01:43:32.006 region:rollup2
WE FALL UNDER AND YOU'VE SEEN

01:43:29.737 --> 01:43:34.275 region:rollup2
SORT OF THE CHALLENGE AROUND.

01:43:32.006 --> 01:43:35.676 region:rollup2
THE COST REPORTS YOU KNOW IF

01:43:34.275 --> 01:43:37.078 region:rollup2
THE AUDITOR IS TRIED TO.

01:43:35.676 --> 01:43:37.678 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IS A COMPLICATED

01:43:37.078 --> 01:43:39.880 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHERE THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:43:37.678 --> 01:43:41.048 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

01:43:39.880 --> 01:43:41.682 region:rollup2
THIS THE IT IS COMPOSED OF FIT

01:43:41.048 --> 01:43:43.184 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AS WELL IN THE VERY

01:43:41.682 --> 01:43:44.819 region:rollup2
FIRST QUESTION ABOUT WHY AREN'T

DEPENDING ON THE PUBLIC TO TO DO

01:44:43.844 --> 01:44:48.916 region:rollup2
THAT THERE REALLY A GRAND JURY I

01:44:46.580 --> 01:44:49.984 region:rollup2
LIKE THAT ANALOGY SORRY I THINK

01:44:48.916 --> 01:44:51.318 region:rollup2
WE CUT YOU OFF PLEASE MISS

01:44:49.984 --> 01:44:52.720 region:rollup2
PARLEY. DISCREDITED TO POINT OUT

01:44:51.318 --> 01:44:54.522 region:rollup2
IT'S IT'S VERY FRUSTRATING FOR

01:44:52.720 --> 01:44:56.357 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO HEAR THAT THE STATE

01:44:54.522 --> 01:44:57.191 region:rollup2
FINDS IT CHALLENGING TO BE ABLE

01:44:56.357 --> 01:44:59.393 region:rollup2
TO.

01:44:57.191 --> 01:45:02.663 region:rollup2
TELL THE STORY ABOUT THE

01:44:59.393 --> 01:45:04.265 region:rollup2
VOLUMES OF DATA AND NARRATIVE

01:45:02.663 --> 01:45:06.066 region:rollup2
THAT ARE BEING REQUIRED TO BE

01:45:04.265 --> 01:45:07.168 region:rollup2
PRODUCED BY COUNTY IS THEN SENT

01:45:06.066 --> 01:45:08.502 region:rollup2
TO THE OVERSIGHT AND

01:45:07.168 --> 01:45:10.938 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION AS

01:45:08.502 --> 01:45:12.873 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT. I AND I

01:45:10.938 --> 01:45:14.141 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY APPRECIATE THAT IT IS

01:45:12.873 --> 01:45:15.543 region:rollup2
CHALLENGING BUT I THINK THAT

01:45:14.141 --> 01:45:17.678 region:rollup2
THAT NEEDS TO STOP BEING A GOOD

01:45:15.543 --> 01:45:20.247 region:rollup2
ENOUGH ANSWER THE FACT THAT IT'S

01:45:17.678 --> 01:45:22.149 region:rollup2
COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING. AND

01:45:20.247 --> 01:45:24.552 region:rollup2
THAT THAT EACH COUNTY IS

01:45:22.149 --> 01:45:25.553 region:rollup2
SUBMITTING PILES OF INFORMATION

01:45:24.552 --> 01:45:28.222 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY BASED ON WHAT

01:45:25.553 --> 01:45:30.891 region:rollup2
THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY HAS TOLD

01:45:28.222 --> 01:45:31.959 region:rollup2
THEM ARE THE NEEDS WITH DATA. IN

01:45:30.891 --> 01:45:33.327 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAMS AND SERVICES

01:45:31.959 --> 01:45:35.262 region:rollup2
THEY'RE PUTTING IN PLACE WITH

01:45:33.327 --> 01:45:36.363 region:rollup2
PREVENTION WITH COMMUNITY

01:45:35.262 --> 01:45:38.632 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS WITH

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:42.303 region:rollup2
INNOVATION THE INFORMATION IS AT

01:45:38.632 --> 01:45:47.842 region:rollup2
OUR FINGERTIPS IT'S THE LACK OF

01:45:42.303 --> 01:45:49.643 region:rollup2
IT IS A. AGENCY AND TO TAKE ALL

01:45:47.842 --> 01:45:51.478 region:rollup2
OF THAT AND THEN TURN THAT INTO

01:45:49.643 --> 01:45:54.815 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT'S VALUABLE I

01:45:51.478 --> 01:45:55.216 region:rollup2
THINK IT IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO

01:45:54.815 --> 01:45:55.783 region:rollup2
BE ABLE TO KNOW.

01:45:55.216 --> 01:45:56.717 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH MONEY ARE COUNTY

01:45:55.783 --> 01:45:58.185 region:rollup2
SPENDING AND ON WHAT TYPE OF

01:45:56.717 --> 01:45:59.053 region:rollup2
THING BUT I THINK MORE VALUABLE

01:45:58.185 --> 01:45:59.687 region:rollup2
WOULD BE TO KNOW OTHER PEOPLE'S

01:45:59.053 --> 01:46:00.120 region:rollup2
LIVES ARE CHANGED IN OUR PEOPLE

01:45:59.687 --> 01:46:00.754 region:rollup2
GETTING HEALTHIER?

01:46:00.120 --> 01:46:01.555 region:rollup2
THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE ACT WAS

01:46:00.754 --> 01:46:02.623 region:rollup2
INTENDED TO TRY TO GET VOTERS

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:04.491 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WERE TELLING VOTERS

01:46:02.623 --> 01:46:06.327 region:rollup2
THAT WE KNEW WHAT WORKED WE WERE

01:46:04.491 --> 01:46:07.795 region:rollup2
BUILDING ON PILOT PROGRAMS THAT

01:46:06.327 --> 01:46:09.096 region:rollup2
WE NEW WORKS AND WHY SHOULDN'T

01:46:07.795 --> 01:46:10.464 region:rollup2
EVERY COMMUNITY HAVE THE OPTION

01:46:09.096 --> 01:46:12.800 region:rollup2
TO DO THOSE THINGS.

01:46:10.464 --> 01:46:13.634 region:rollup2
SO THE ABILITY TO HAVE A STATE

01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:14.668 region:rollup2
AGENCY WHETHER IT'S THE

01:46:13.634 --> 01:46:15.803 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT COMMISSIONER THE

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:17.304 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:46:15.803 --> 01:46:19.240 region:rollup2
CONTRACT OUT WITH A THIRD

01:46:17.304 --> 01:46:21.475 region:rollup2

01:46:21.475 --> 01:46:24.345 region:rollup2
THE VOLUMES OF INFORMATION

01:46:22.943 --> 01:46:25.980 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEING COLLECTED AND TURN

01:46:24.345 --> 01:46:27.248 region:rollup2
THAT INTO A STORY ABOUT THE

01:46:25.980 --> 01:46:29.250 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES THAT PEOPLE ARE

01:46:27.248 --> 01:46:30.951 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCING. SOMETHING CVH DAY

01:46:29.250 --> 01:46:32.419 region:rollup2
WOULD VERY MUCH UNLIKE THE

01:46:30.951 --> 01:46:34.021 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S PARTNERSHIP IN

01:46:32.419 --> 01:46:34.955 region:rollup2
LEADERSHIP AND THEN IT'S A TOPIC

01:46:34.021 --> 01:46:36.690 region:rollup2
THAT WILL BE HEARD IN THE SENATE

01:46:34.955 --> 01:46:37.891 region:rollup2
BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE THREE LATER

01:46:36.690 --> 01:46:38.058 region:rollup2
THIS WEEK.

01:46:37.891 --> 01:46:39.260 region:rollup2
CAN.

01:46:38.058 --> 01:46:41.729 region:rollup2
.

01:46:39.260 --> 01:46:44.398 region:rollup2
WHAT WHAT METRICS WOULD THE

COUNTY HIGHLIGHTED AS EFFECTIVE?

01:46:44.398 --> 01:46:48.068 region:rollup2
EXAMPLES OF MONEY BEING WELL

01:46:46.700 --> 01:46:50.304 region:rollup2
SPENT.

01:46:48.068 --> 01:46:52.473 region:rollup2
I THINK AND I THINK ONE NEED

01:46:50.304 --> 01:46:54.208 region:rollup2
ONLY READ THE ACT.

01:46:52.473 --> 01:46:55.542 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WHILE THERE ARE A

01:46:54.208 --> 01:46:57.244 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF

01:46:55.542 --> 01:46:58.946 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND

01:46:57.244 --> 01:47:00.447 region:rollup2
SPECIAL TARGET POPULATIONS

01:46:58.946 --> 01:47:02.082 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY OF

01:47:00.447 --> 01:47:03.851 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA BEING IMPLEMENTED.

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:05.486 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF WAYS IN

01:47:03.851 --> 01:47:06.687 region:rollup2
WHICH EVERY COUNTY HAS BEEN

01:47:05.486 --> 01:47:08.088 region:rollup2
EXPECTED TO.

01:47:06.687 --> 01:47:09.323 region:rollup2
RES.

01:47:08.088 --> 01:47:11.325 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW TO REALLY BE LOOKING AT

01:47:09.323 --> 01:47:12.927 region:rollup2
CAN YOU TELL US THAT THE PROGRAM

01:47:11.325 --> 01:47:15.129 region:rollup2
THAT YOU'VE DEVELOPED IS

01:47:12.927 --> 01:47:16.864 region:rollup2
REDUCING INCARCERATIONS IS

01:47:15.129 --> 01:47:18.532 region:rollup2
IMPROVING AND SCHOOL INVOLVEMENT

01:47:16.864 --> 01:47:19.733 region:rollup2
FOR KIDS IS KEEPING OUT OF

01:47:18.532 --> 01:47:20.968 region:rollup2
PEOPLE OUT OF HOSPITALS WHEN

01:47:19.733 --> 01:47:22.836 region:rollup2
THERE'S THE SEVEN OR EIGHT

01:47:20.968 --> 01:47:24.038 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES THAT ARE LISTED. THAT'S

01:47:22.836 --> 01:47:25.105 region:rollup2
WHAT THE VOTER PAMPHLET SAID WE

01:47:24.038 --> 01:47:26.206 region:rollup2
ALL SHOWED UP.

01:47:25.105 --> 01:47:27.141 region:rollup2
TO THE ELECTION IN TWO THOUSAND

01:47:26.206 --> 01:47:29.710 region:rollup2
AND FOUR AND I THINK WE NEED TO

01:47:27.141 --> 01:47:31.378 region:rollup2
START THEIR.

01:47:29.710 --> 01:47:32.947 region:rollup2
HAVE WE AS A STATE COLLECTED

01:47:31.378 --> 01:47:34.214 region:rollup2
THAT DATA AT ANY POINT OVER THE

01:47:32.947 --> 01:47:39.353 region:rollup2
LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND HOW ARE

01:47:34.214 --> 01:47:41.021 region:rollup2
WE TREND.

01:47:39.353 --> 01:47:43.257 region:rollup2
WELL I THINK THIS IS.

01:47:41.021 --> 01:47:44.725 region:rollup2
PART OF THE CONVERSATION FOR

01:47:43.257 --> 01:47:45.759 region:rollup2
LATER IN THE AGENDA IN TERMS OF

01:47:44.725 --> 01:47:48.262 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENTS.

01:47:45.759 --> 01:47:49.797 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT AND MATURITY AROUND

01:47:48.262 --> 01:47:51.832 region:rollup2
A PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES SYSTEM IT

01:47:49.797 --> 01:47:54.001 region:rollup2
IS NOT AND SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED

01:47:51.832 --> 01:47:55.169 region:rollup2
ON MHSAA. SO IT GETS BACK TO

01:47:54.001 --> 01:47:56.370 region:rollup2
KIND OF MY INITIAL COMMENTS

01:47:55.169 --> 01:47:58.372 region:rollup2
AROUND.

01:47:56.370 --> 01:48:00.341 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH DELIVERY IN

01:47:58.372 --> 01:48:01.642 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA USING A VARIETY OF

01:48:00.341 --> 01:48:02.343 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS AND SO

01:48:01.642 --> 01:48:05.245 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

01:48:02.343 --> 01:48:07.214 region:rollup2
METRICS THAT WE ARE BUILDING

01:48:05.245 --> 01:48:08.849 region:rollup2
AND DEVELOPING AS AND WE TRY TO

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:10.584 region:rollup2
MEASURE OUTCOMES AS A STATE AND

01:48:08.849 --> 01:48:11.885 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH AND FOR WHAT WE

01:48:10.584 --> 01:48:13.487 region:rollup2
OVERSEE AND.

01:48:11.885 --> 01:48:15.255 region:rollup2
BUT THAT'S A THAT'S SLIGHTLY

01:48:13.487 --> 01:48:17.758 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THAN WHAT

01:48:15.255 --> 01:48:19.259 region:rollup2
YOU WERE ASKING AS IT PERTAINS

01:48:17.758 --> 01:48:22.663 region:rollup2
TO AN AGE OF SAY. WE DIDN'T OF

01:48:19.259 --> 01:48:26.333 region:rollup2
THE DC ARE I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT

01:48:22.663 --> 01:48:26.900 region:rollup2
IT STANDS FOR.

01:48:26.333 --> 01:48:28.635 region:rollup2
WHICH BRENDA.

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.836 region:rollup2
CAN SPEAK VERY ADEPTLY AT I'M

01:48:28.635 --> 01:48:29.837 region:rollup2
SURE.

01:48:28.836 --> 01:48:30.437 region:rollup2
FOR AS A DATA PERSON WHICH WAS

01:48:29.837 --> 01:48:31.038 region:rollup2
COLLECTING INFORMATION ABOUT A

01:48:30.437 --> 01:48:32.039 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR COMPONENT THE FULL

01:48:31.038 --> 01:48:33.007 region:rollup2
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS WHICH IS A

01:48:32.039 --> 01:48:34.508 region:rollup2
A VERY BIG PART OF THE

01:48:33.007 --> 01:48:35.275 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS THAT COUNTIES ARE

01:48:34.508 --> 01:48:37.211 region:rollup2
MAKING.

01:48:35.275 --> 01:48:39.413 region:rollup2
BUT I DO THINK THAT WE HAVE

01:48:37.211 --> 01:48:41.715 region:rollup2
SEEN OTHER ORGANIZATIONS OUTSIDE

01:48:39.413 --> 01:48:42.950 region:rollup2
OF GOVERNMENT BE ABLE TO TAKE

01:48:41.715 --> 01:48:44.084 region:rollup2
THESE KINDS OF COMPLEX THINGS

01:48:42.950 --> 01:48:46.020 region:rollup2
AND LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE

01:48:44.084 --> 01:48:48.655 region:rollup2
PREVENTION. AND BE ABLE TO TELL

01:48:46.020 --> 01:48:49.156 region:rollup2
US IN FACT ARE THOSE INVESTMENTS

01:48:48.655 --> 01:48:50.424 region:rollup2
COST YOU KNOW THEIR COST

01:48:49.156 --> 01:48:51.959 region:rollup2
BENEFIT.

01:48:50.424 --> 01:48:53.360 region:rollup2
AND NOT JUST CAN BE TRACED WHICH

01:48:51.959 --> 01:48:55.162 region:rollup2
DOLLAR WENT TO WHICH PROGRAM BUT

01:48:53.360 --> 01:48:57.931 region:rollup2
MORE IMPORTANTLY AGAIN DID THE

01:48:55.162 --> 01:48:59.299 region:rollup2
DOLLAR INVESTED GET TO THE

01:48:57.931 --> 01:49:01.235 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES THAT VOTERS EXPECTED.

01:48:59.299 --> 01:49:03.404 region:rollup2
AND I GUESS THAT'S THE. POINT I

01:49:01.235 --> 01:49:06.173 region:rollup2
KEEP TRYING TO DRIVE FOR AND I'M

01:49:03.404 --> 01:49:06.740 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR AN OUTCOME WE CAN

01:49:06.173 --> 01:49:09.009 region:rollup2
HANG OUR HAT ON.

01:49:06.740 --> 01:49:09.510 region:rollup2
FOR THE INCREASE IN COVERAGE AS

01:49:09.009 --> 01:49:10.844 region:rollup2
WELL AS THE INCREASE IN

01:49:09.510 --> 01:49:13.180 region:rollup2
SPENDING.

01:49:10.844 --> 01:49:16.316 region:rollup2
WHAT CAN WE SHOW DEFINITIVELY

01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:17.618 region:rollup2
AFTER YEARS OF INVESTMENTS?

01:49:16.316 --> 01:49:19.186 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE MADE MEANINGFUL IMPACT

01:49:17.618 --> 01:49:22.056 region:rollup2
FOLD DIFFERENCE AT THE COUNTY

01:49:19.186 --> 01:49:22.623 region:rollup2
LEVEL AND I'M HAPPY TO HEAR BUT

01:49:22.056 --> 01:49:23.557 region:rollup2
I HAVE NOT HEARD FROM ANYONE

01:49:22.623 --> 01:49:24.925 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:49:23.557 --> 01:49:25.993 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S A DEMONSTRATE A

01:49:24.925 --> 01:49:27.928 region:rollup2
BOWL.

01:49:25.993 --> 01:49:30.397 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENT

01:49:27.928 --> 01:49:31.899 region:rollup2
POST MONEY BEING SPENT ON SO I

01:49:30.397 --> 01:49:33.567 region:rollup2
ASK AGAIN DO WE HAVE THE

01:49:31.899 --> 01:49:35.335 region:rollup2
APPROACH APPROPRIATE

01:49:33.567 --> 01:49:36.970 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT.

01:49:35.335 --> 01:49:38.672 region:rollup2
OVER THE SPENDING THAT WE HAVE

01:49:36.970 --> 01:49:40.407 region:rollup2
BEFORE US TODAY AYE I DO KNOW

01:49:38.672 --> 01:49:42.309 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE IT'S REQUIRED OF

01:49:40.407 --> 01:49:44.111 region:rollup2
EVERY COUNTY TO ADDRESS

01:49:42.309 --> 01:49:45.846 region:rollup2
EVALUATION OUTCOMES THAT EVERY

01:49:44.111 --> 01:49:47.614 region:rollup2
COUNTY. IS LOOKING AT THE

01:49:45.846 --> 01:49:50.717 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES THEY'RE PRODUCING THAT

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:50.984 region:rollup2
GETS REPORTED IN PART OF HOW

01:49:50.717 --> 01:49:51.919 region:rollup2
THEY THE.

01:49:50.984 --> 01:49:53.420 region:rollup2
.

01:49:51.919 --> 01:49:55.122 region:rollup2
SO TO RATIONALIZE THEIR THEIR

01:49:53.420 --> 01:49:56.657 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR PLANS YOU KNOW WE'VE

01:49:55.122 --> 01:49:58.092 region:rollup2
DONE THIS IT WORKS WE'VE

01:49:56.657 --> 01:49:59.993 region:rollup2
THEREFORE ARE EXPANDING INTO

01:49:58.092 --> 01:50:02.596 region:rollup2
CONTINUING IT SO WE KNOW THAT AT

01:49:59.993 --> 01:50:04.498 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL. THERE IS ROBUST

01:50:02.596 --> 01:50:06.033 region:rollup2
INFORMATION JUST I THINK I'M A

01:50:04.498 --> 01:50:07.301 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO ONE OF OUR

01:50:06.033 --> 01:50:09.002 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WAS HERE BRIEFING THE

01:50:07.301 --> 01:50:10.704 region:rollup2
LOS ANGELES COUNTY DELEGATION ON

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:12.372 region:rollup2
A RECENT RAND REPORT THAT LOOKED

01:50:10.704 --> 01:50:14.441 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY AT ITS MHSAA

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:16.577 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS NOW COMES. RAND HAS

01:50:14.441 --> 01:50:18.145 region:rollup2
ALSO EVALUATED HUNDREDS OF

01:50:16.577 --> 01:50:19.046 region:rollup2
MILLIONS AND PREVENTION DOLLARS

01:50:18.145 --> 01:50:21.315 region:rollup2
THAT THE COUNTY'S JOINTLY

01:50:19.046 --> 01:50:22.983 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED TO REDUCE SUICIDE

01:50:21.315 --> 01:50:24.284 region:rollup2
IN REDUCED EGGMAN DISCRIMINATION

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:25.419 region:rollup2
IS ARE THINGS THAT WERE ABLE TO

01:50:24.284 --> 01:50:27.821 region:rollup2
SHOW WORK.

01:50:25.419 --> 01:50:28.422 region:rollup2
BUT AS TO TO THE MANY OTHER

01:50:27.821 --> 01:50:30.390 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

01:50:28.422 --> 01:50:33.026 region:rollup2
BEING EXPENDED STATEWIDE I

01:50:30.390 --> 01:50:33.227 region:rollup2
THINK WE REALLY IT IS MORE THAN

01:50:33.026 --> 01:50:36.296 region:rollup2
TIME.

01:50:33.227 --> 01:50:37.731 region:rollup2
FOR ONE UNIFIED APPROACH TO

01:50:36.296 --> 01:50:39.733 region:rollup2
BEING ABLE TO EVALUATE THE

01:50:37.731 --> 01:50:41.702 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND THE OTHER GOOD NEWS

01:50:39.733 --> 01:50:43.003 region:rollup2
SAYS THE ACT ACTUALLY

01:50:41.702 --> 01:50:46.140 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED THIS.

01:50:43.003 --> 01:50:46.773 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE ADMINISTRATION

01:50:46.140 --> 01:50:48.542 region:rollup2
ARENA IN THE ACT.

01:50:46.773 --> 01:50:50.310 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE VERY SPECIFIED

01:50:48.542 --> 01:50:52.146 region:rollup2
PURPOSES OF OF THAT UP TO FIVE

01:50:50.310 --> 01:50:53.680 region:rollup2
PERCENT BE SET ASIDE FOR IS TO

01:50:52.146 --> 01:50:55.382 region:rollup2
ENSURE AN ADEQUATE EVALUATION

01:50:53.680 --> 01:50:56.950 region:rollup2
THE OUTCOMES OCCUR. SO IT'S NOT

01:50:55.382 --> 01:50:58.952 region:rollup2
EVEN FOR LACK OF A FUNDING

01:50:56.950 --> 01:51:00.521 region:rollup2
SOURCE SO I THINK THAT'S A GREAT

01:50:58.952 --> 01:51:01.588 region:rollup2
SEGUE IN THIS WILL BE THE LAST

01:51:00.521 --> 01:51:02.089 region:rollup2
ROUND OF QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE

01:51:01.588 --> 01:51:04.191 region:rollup2
ON THIS ISSUE BEFORE WE

01:51:02.089 --> 01:51:05.359 region:rollup2
PROGRESS.

01:51:04.191 --> 01:51:07.628 region:rollup2
IS REGARDING.

01:51:05.359 --> 01:51:08.362 region:rollup2
STATE ADMINISTRATION SO MY

01:51:07.628 --> 01:51:09.930 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND IS THAT WE HAVE

01:51:08.362 --> 01:51:11.732 region:rollup2
ACCESS

01:51:09.930 --> 01:51:13.467 region:rollup2
MONEY IN STATE ADMINISTRATION

01:51:11.732 --> 01:51:17.037 region:rollup2
FUNDS AS WELL CAN WE GET IT.

01:51:13.467 --> 01:51:17.638 region:rollup2
A BASIS FOR HOW MUCH EXTRA

01:51:17.037 --> 01:51:18.639 region:rollup2
STATE ADMINISTRATION FUNDS WE

01:51:17.638 --> 01:51:20.974 region:rollup2
HAVE.

01:51:18.639 --> 01:51:23.310 region:rollup2
RIGHT SO AS NOTED ON PAGE

01:51:20.974 --> 01:51:23.544 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN AND NAY AGENDA THERE'S A

01:51:23.310 --> 01:51:26.146 region:rollup2
CHART.

01:51:23.544 --> 01:51:27.948 region:rollup2
THAT REFLECTS THE STATE

01:51:26.146 --> 01:51:30.651 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE A.

01:51:27.948 --> 01:51:31.818 region:rollup2
ADMIN CAP FILE A CHART THAT WE

01:51:30.651 --> 01:51:32.753 region:rollup2
REFER TO AS ADMIN CAP.

01:51:31.818 --> 01:51:34.688 region:rollup2
SO IN THAT.

01:51:32.753 --> 01:51:36.290 region:rollup2
YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE THAT AT THE

01:51:34.688 --> 01:51:38.125 region:rollup2
VERY BOTTOM THAT THAT THERE'S

01:51:36.290 --> 01:51:39.426 region:rollup2
APPROXIMATELY SIXTY TWO POINT

01:51:38.125 --> 01:51:41.795 region:rollup2
THREE MILLION THAT'S AVAILABLE.

01:51:39.426 --> 01:51:42.029 region:rollup2
IN ACCESS FUNDS THAT CAN BE

01:51:41.795 --> 01:51:43.964 region:rollup2
USED TO.

01:51:42.029 --> 01:51:45.933 region:rollup2
.

01:51:43.964 --> 01:51:47.401 region:rollup2
FROM THE MHS F.. ALTHOUGH ALL

01:51:45.933 --> 01:51:48.368 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:51:47.401 --> 01:51:50.437 region:rollup2
THE PRIMARY.

01:51:48.368 --> 01:51:52.539 region:rollup2
IT THAT.

01:51:50.437 --> 01:51:53.340 region:rollup2
WHEN LOOKING AT THIS BALLOTS

01:51:52.539 --> 01:51:55.642 region:rollup2
THIS ISN'T CONSIDERED A WAH

01:51:53.340 --> 01:51:56.877 region:rollup2
ONGOING AMOUNT THAT CAN BE SPENT

01:51:55.642 --> 01:51:57.477 region:rollup2
A RATHER WE VIEWED THE

01:51:56.877 --> 01:51:59.546 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION VIEWS AS A ONE

01:51:57.477 --> 01:52:02.449 region:rollup2
TIME. AND THAT'S BECAUSE OF THE

01:51:59.546 --> 01:52:03.750 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF OUR EXPENDITURES.

01:52:02.449 --> 01:52:05.719 region:rollup2
THAT IS CURRENTLY BEING IN OUR

01:52:03.750 --> 01:52:06.920 region:rollup2
ONGOING EXPENSES BEING OBLIGATED

01:52:05.719 --> 01:52:08.388 region:rollup2
ARE EXCEEDING.

01:52:06.920 --> 01:52:08.989 region:rollup2
.

01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:09.957 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT THAT'S GOING TO BE

01:52:08.989 --> 01:52:11.992 region:rollup2
RECEIVED

01:52:09.957 --> 01:52:13.594 region:rollup2
AND SO THE REASON THAT THERE IS

01:52:11.992 --> 01:52:15.495 region:rollup2
THERE ARE RESERVISTS BECAUSE OF

01:52:13.594 --> 01:52:17.431 region:rollup2
PAST YEAR. SAVINGS THAT HAVE

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:18.999 region:rollup2
ACCRUED SO THAT.

01:52:17.431 --> 01:52:19.333 region:rollup2
AMOUNT KIND OF ROLES DO IT'S

01:52:18.999 --> 01:52:20.100 region:rollup2
APPALLING BASE

01:52:19.333 --> 01:52:21.802 region:rollup2
SPEAK.

01:52:20.100 --> 01:52:23.770 region:rollup2
.

01:52:21.802 --> 01:52:25.138 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE SAID THAT THOSE

01:52:23.770 --> 01:52:26.873 region:rollup2
FUNDS COULD BE USED FOR.

01:52:25.138 --> 01:52:28.842 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF

01:52:26.873 --> 01:52:30.978 region:rollup2
THIS PROGRAM IS THAT CORRECT.

01:52:28.842 --> 01:52:32.145 region:rollup2
SURE IS THERE A REASON WE'RE NOT

01:52:30.978 --> 01:52:38.318 region:rollup2
USING THESE FUNDS FOR

01:52:32.145 --> 01:52:40.020 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT.

01:52:38.318 --> 01:52:42.022 region:rollup2
I MEAN I WOULD I WOULD SAY THAT

01:52:40.020 --> 01:52:45.125 region:rollup2
THE USE OF THOSE FUNDS WOULD BE.

01:52:42.022 --> 01:52:47.027 region:rollup2
ANY CHANGER ADDITIONAL USE OF

01:52:45.125 --> 01:52:48.161 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS WOULD JUST BE A AND

01:52:47.027 --> 01:52:49.563 region:rollup2
AN AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

01:52:48.161 --> 01:52:50.130 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION AND THE

01:52:49.563 --> 01:52:51.231 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AS TO WHETHER OR

01:52:50.130 --> 01:52:52.099 region:rollup2
NOT.

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:53.500 region:rollup2
AND HOW YOU WOULD WANT TO USE

01:52:52.099 --> 01:52:55.102 region:rollup2
THAT I KNOW THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:56.570 region:rollup2
USED IN THE PAST FOR OTHER

01:52:55.102 --> 01:52:58.438 region:rollup2
ONETIME INITIATIVES WHICH ARE

01:52:56.570 --> 01:53:00.040 region:rollup2
COMING UP ON YOUR. AGENDA LATER

01:52:58.438 --> 01:53:01.475 region:rollup2
AROUND SUICIDE PREVENTION AND SO

01:53:00.040 --> 01:53:02.976 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S ALWAYS THE

01:53:01.475 --> 01:53:03.744 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATION BETWEEN THE

01:53:02.976 --> 01:53:05.045 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND THE

01:53:03.744 --> 01:53:06.346 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ON ON WHETHER OR

01:53:05.045 --> 01:53:07.247 region:rollup2
NOT THAT'S FUNDS SHOULD BE USED

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:08.482 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH AND UNDER WHAT

01:53:07.247 --> 01:53:10.183 region:rollup2
CIRCUMSTANCES. HOW MANY

01:53:08.482 --> 01:53:11.652 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES DO YOU CURRENTLY HAVE

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:13.620 region:rollup2
THAT HELP YOU WITH

01:53:11.652 --> 01:53:18.225 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABILITY AND OVERSIGHT OF

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:20.994 region:rollup2
MY CHEST I?

01:53:18.225 --> 01:53:23.397 region:rollup2
IT'S LESS THAN TWENTY FIVE.

01:53:20.994 --> 01:53:25.332 region:rollup2
THAT'S ALSO ONE OF THE ITEMS

01:53:23.397 --> 01:53:26.967 region:rollup2
THAT'S BEFORE YOU TODAY AND THAT

01:53:25.332 --> 01:53:28.368 region:rollup2
WE RECEIVED FUNDING BUT NOT

01:53:26.967 --> 01:53:29.569 region:rollup2
POSITION AUTHORITY WHICH WE WILL

01:53:28.368 --> 01:53:31.371 region:rollup2
COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT BUT

01:53:29.569 --> 01:53:33.006 region:rollup2
IT'S PROBABLY TWENTY TWO TWENTY

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:35.409 region:rollup2
THREE POSITIONS TOTAL. IS THERE

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:36.610 region:rollup2
A.

01:53:35.409 --> 01:53:37.811 region:rollup2
IS THERE A LACK AND I GUESS

01:53:36.610 --> 01:53:39.813 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DR ED

01:53:37.811 --> 01:53:41.748 region:rollup2
RIGHT I'M I'M. IN NO MEANS AM I

01:53:39.813 --> 01:53:43.850 region:rollup2
EVER TRYING TO PLACE BLAME ON

01:53:41.748 --> 01:53:45.552 region:rollup2
TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS. AND IT

01:53:43.850 --> 01:53:46.720 region:rollup2
SEEMS AS IF WE HAVE APPROPRIATE

01:53:45.552 --> 01:53:48.755 region:rollup2
FUNDS.

01:53:46.720 --> 01:53:50.757 region:rollup2
WHAT ARE WE MISSING?

01:53:48.755 --> 01:53:52.426 region:rollup2
IS IT NOT HAVING THE APPROPRIATE

01:53:50.757 --> 01:53:53.627 region:rollup2
POSITIONS ARE THE OVERSIGHT IS

01:53:52.426 --> 01:53:55.362 region:rollup2
THAT THE FACT THAT MONEY GOES

01:53:53.627 --> 01:53:57.264 region:rollup2
OUT THE DOOR. WITHOUT HAVING

01:53:55.362 --> 01:53:59.900 region:rollup2
CHECKED THE PLANS BEFOREHAND IS

01:53:57.264 --> 01:54:01.234 region:rollup2
IT THE OVERSEEING DEPARTMENT

01:53:59.900 --> 01:54:02.969 region:rollup2
ISN'T THE APPROPRIATE PLACE TO

01:54:01.234 --> 01:54:05.005 region:rollup2
HOUSE THIS.

01:54:02.969 --> 01:54:07.407 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE ARE QUESTIONS THAT

01:54:05.005 --> 01:54:08.608 region:rollup2
WE AS A LEGISLATURE ARE GOING TO

01:54:07.407 --> 01:54:10.077 region:rollup2
BE GRAPPLING WITH THIS YEAR. BUT

01:54:08.608 --> 01:54:11.978 region:rollup2
IT'S.

01:54:10.077 --> 01:54:14.247 region:rollup2
A BIT DISTURBING TO RECEIVE THIS

01:54:11.978 --> 01:54:15.916 region:rollup2
AUDIT REPORT AND I MUST ADMIT.

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:17.751 region:rollup2
TO LOOK AT THE AUDIT REPORT THAT

01:54:15.916 --> 01:54:19.486 region:rollup2
CAME BEFORE THIS AS WELL.

01:54:17.751 --> 01:54:21.388 region:rollup2
THAT SHOWED MUCH OF THE SAME%

01:54:19.486 --> 01:54:22.956 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS SO I DON'T BELIEVE THIS

01:54:21.388 --> 01:54:24.024 region:rollup2
IS A.

01:54:22.956 --> 01:54:25.659 region:rollup2
A NEW PROBLEM THAT WERE

01:54:24.024 --> 01:54:27.527 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING.

01:54:25.659 --> 01:54:29.463 region:rollup2
AND I LOOK FORWARD TO A

01:54:27.527 --> 01:54:30.964 region:rollup2
CONTINUING THIS SO WE WILL HOLD

01:54:29.463 --> 01:54:33.066 region:rollup2
ISSUE TO OPEN.

01:54:30.964 --> 01:54:34.668 region:rollup2
AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR

01:54:33.066 --> 01:54:36.236 region:rollup2
CANDOR AND BILLETED TO TALK

01:54:34.668 --> 01:54:37.170 region:rollup2
ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS.

01:54:36.236 --> 01:54:48.448 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE WILL MOVE ON TO

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:49.616 region:rollup2
ISSUE THREE.

01:54:48.448 --> 01:54:55.922 region:rollup2
THERE YOU GO.

01:54:49.616 --> 01:54:58.825 region:rollup2
ARE YOU GOING.

01:54:55.922 --> 01:55:11.071 region:rollup2
CAN THAT OUT OF HERE.

01:54:58.825 --> 01:55:21.314 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW IF.

01:55:11.071 --> 01:55:27.254 region:rollup2
ACCORDINGLY.

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:31.091 region:rollup2
COMING.

01:55:27.254 --> 01:55:33.860 region:rollup2
HOLD.

01:55:31.091 --> 01:55:34.995 region:rollup2
IN.

01:55:33.860 --> 01:55:36.730 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU'RE READY TO ORDER.

01:55:34.995 --> 01:55:37.130 region:rollup2
SURE. SO AND.

01:55:36.730 --> 01:55:38.565 region:rollup2
WHEN THE.

01:55:37.130 --> 01:55:41.001 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH WAS.

01:55:38.565 --> 01:55:41.535 region:rollup2
DISMANTLED AND WE OBSERVE THE

01:55:41.001 --> 01:55:44.137 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH.

01:55:41.535 --> 01:55:45.605 region:rollup2
SO FIVE PIECES OF THAT

01:55:44.137 --> 01:55:46.173 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

01:55:45.605 --> 01:55:48.208 region:rollup2
THE.

01:55:46.173 --> 01:55:49.943 region:rollup2
SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE THAT

IT IN THE PARAMETERS OF WHAT THE

02:00:30.390 --> 02:00:32.892 region:rollup2

02:00:31.124 --> 02:00:33.860 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE MOVING FORWARD.

02:00:39.599 --> 02:00:42.969 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE LOCAL IMPLEMENTATION

02:00:41.468 --> 02:00:44.504 region:rollup2
OF SUICIDE PREVENTION ACTIVITIES

02:00:42.969 --> 02:00:45.839 region:rollup2
IN OUR STATE I DID BRING SOME

02:00:44.504 --> 02:00:46.873 region:rollup2
MATERIALS BUT THE SERGEANTS NEED

02:00:45.839 --> 02:00:47.407 region:rollup2
TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE APPROVED

02:00:46.873 --> 02:00:48.341 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE COULD DISTRIBUTE

02:00:47.407 --> 02:00:50.577 region:rollup2
THOSE.

02:00:48.341 --> 02:00:52.078 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THE COUNTY IS.

02:00:50.577 --> 02:00:53.346 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION TO THE SUICIDE

02:00:52.078 --> 02:00:54.647 region:rollup2

SUICIDE PREVENTION WORK.

02:01:02.522 --> 02:01:06.760 region:rollup2
I THINK IT'S RARE IN OUR NATION

02:01:04.958 --> 02:01:07.961 region:rollup2
THAT THE COUNTY BUT A WHOLE

02:01:06.760 --> 02:01:08.895 region:rollup2

WHAT'S BEING DONE WITH THEM AND

02:07:17.697 --> 02:07:20.633 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE BEING TRACKED I

02:07:19.198 --> 02:07:22.068 region:rollup2
WANNA TALK ABOUT SOMETHING.

02:07:20.633 --> 02:07:23.870 region:rollup2
I CAN SAFELY LIVES ONE PERSON AT

02:07:22.068 --> 02:07:25.271 region:rollup2
A TIME.

02:07:23.870 --> 02:07:27.039 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S THE NATIONAL SUICIDE

02:07:25.271 --> 02:07:29.108 region:rollup2
PREVENTION LIFELINE.

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:31.210 region:rollup2
ONE COUNSELOR TALKS TO ONE

02:07:29.108 --> 02:07:33.646 region:rollup2
PERSON AND GIVES THEM A GLIMMER

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:34.914 region:rollup2
OF HOPE.

02:07:33.646 --> 02:07:37.283 region:rollup2
THE THE MATH IT'S THAT THIS NEW

02:07:34.914 --> 02:07:39.118 region:rollup2
LIFELINE USES HAVE BEEN VERIFIED

02:07:37.283 --> 02:07:42.054 region:rollup2
BY RESEARCH AS BEING EFFECTIVE

02:07:39.118 --> 02:07:43.422 region:rollup2
AND SAVING LIVES.

02:07:42.054 --> 02:07:44.357 region:rollup2
HE MIGHT NOT KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT

02:07:43.422 --> 02:07:45.758 region:rollup2
IT OR YOU MIGHT THINK IT'S

02:07:44.357 --> 02:07:48.294 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT SINCE IT'S

02:07:45.758 --> 02:07:50.663 region:rollup2
NATIONAL SANSA PAYS FOR THAT'S

02:07:48.294 --> 02:07:51.898 region:rollup2
NOT TRUE THEY LAUNCHED IT. BUT

02:07:50.663 --> 02:07:53.1000 region:rollup2
THEY DO NOT PAY FOR IT WITHIN

02:07:51.898 --> 02:07:56.269 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S.

02:07:53.1000 --> 02:07:58.738 region:rollup2
MOST LINES GET ONE THOUSAND FIVE

02:07:56.269 --> 02:08:00.339 region:rollup2
HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:07:58.738 --> 02:08:03.009 region:rollup2
IT'S DEVELOPED IN A WAY THAT

02:08:00.339 --> 02:08:05.011 region:rollup2
IT'S BASED ON RESEARCH.

02:08:03.009 --> 02:08:07.079 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICES.

02:08:05.011 --> 02:08:08.548 region:rollup2
HAS Q. A ALL THE WINES ARE

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:10.783 region:rollup2
ACCREDITED.

02:08:08.548 --> 02:08:12.785 region:rollup2
IT'S LINKED WITH FACEBOOK SO

02:08:10.783 --> 02:08:13.619 region:rollup2
THAT OF SOMEONE ON FACEBOOK USE

02:08:12.785 --> 02:08:15.588 region:rollup2
OF CERTAIN KEY WORDS.

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:17.990 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:08:15.588 --> 02:08:19.926 region:rollup2
INDICATE THEY MAY BE SUICIDAL.

02:08:17.990 --> 02:08:21.594 region:rollup2
THE LINE POPS UP THE NATIONAL

02:08:19.926 --> 02:08:23.529 region:rollup2
SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE

02:08:21.594 --> 02:08:26.465 region:rollup2
NUMBER IT HAS SPANISH TWENTY

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:28.200 region:rollup2
FOUR HOURS A DAY.

02:08:26.465 --> 02:08:29.902 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA HAS TEN OF THOSE

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:33.239 region:rollup2
LINES.

02:08:29.902 --> 02:08:35.107 region:rollup2
AND CALIFORNIA HAS NOT YET FOUND

02:08:33.239 --> 02:08:36.742 region:rollup2
A WAY TO GO FROM ALLOCATING

02:08:35.107 --> 02:08:39.946 region:rollup2
MONEY.

02:08:36.742 --> 02:08:41.881 region:rollup2
TWO USING IT TO SAVE LIVES.

02:08:39.946 --> 02:08:43.849 region:rollup2
AND I I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

02:08:41.881 --> 02:08:45.151 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT.

02:08:43.849 --> 02:08:48.020 region:rollup2
IT'S BEEN UNDER A LOT OF

02:08:45.151 --> 02:08:48.688 region:rollup2
PRESSURE AND A LOT OF CHANGE.

02:08:48.020 --> 02:08:50.356 region:rollup2
BUT IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN

02:08:48.688 --> 02:08:51.857 region:rollup2
WERE VERY GRATEFUL THAT THIS

02:08:50.356 --> 02:08:54.260 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE VOTED.

02:08:51.857 --> 02:08:56.062 region:rollup2

AND WE'RE STILL WAITING FOR THE

02:09:05.538 --> 02:09:08.407 region:rollup2
MONEY.

02:09:07.073 --> 02:09:10.509 region:rollup2
I UNDERSTAND THAT PART OF IT'S

02:09:08.407 --> 02:09:13.346 region:rollup2
UNDERSTOOD A CONFUSION ABOUT

02:09:10.509 --> 02:09:15.715 region:rollup2
WHAT EXACTLY IS ACCEPTABLE COSTS

02:09:13.346 --> 02:09:17.917 region:rollup2

PAY FOR A GENERATOR SO THAT

02:09:21.721 --> 02:09:24.790 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE WE CAN

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:26.359 region:rollup2
KEEP THE LINES UP.

02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:28.194 region:rollup2
WHEN PEOPLE MOST NEED US CAN

02:09:26.359 --> 02:09:29.295 region:rollup2
WOOD PAPER CUBICLES.

02:09:28.194 --> 02:09:30.830 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT WE NEED TO HIRE

02:09:29.295 --> 02:09:32.365 region:rollup2
CONSIDER IN.

02:09:30.830 --> 02:09:32.565 region:rollup2
AND IF NONE OF THOSE CAN BE PAID

02:09:32.365 --> 02:09:34.567 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:09:32.565 --> 02:09:35.868 region:rollup2
AND

02:09:34.567 --> 02:09:37.970 region:rollup2
WE'RE HAPPY TO MAKE YET ANOTHER

02:09:35.868 --> 02:09:39.505 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

SO I REALLY ASK THAT WE THINK

02:09:43.442 --> 02:09:47.346 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

02:09:45.845 --> 02:09:49.115 region:rollup2
WHEN WE KNOW SOMETHING WORKS

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:52.218 region:rollup2
WHEN IT'S VALIDATED WHEN WE HAVE

02:09:49.115 --> 02:09:53.753 region:rollup2
RESEARCH THAT AFTER PHONE CALLS

02:09:52.218 --> 02:09:55.554 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE LESS LIKELY. TO TAKE

02:09:53.753 --> 02:09:57.323 region:rollup2

02:10:34.460 --> 02:10:38.130 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S IT'S BEEN FRUSTRATING

02:10:37.063 --> 02:10:39.832 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE THE MONEY

02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:42.034 region:rollup2

02:10:39.832 --> 02:10:43.602 region:rollup2
YEARS. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED

02:10:42.034 --> 02:10:45.338 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT TWO YEARS IS THAT

02:10:43.602 --> 02:10:46.305 region:rollup2
THE SUICIDE RATES CONTINUE TO

02:10:45.338 --> 02:10:47.440 region:rollup2
RISE.

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:49.308 region:rollup2

FOUND WITH THE RECENT AUDIT.

02:13:42.781 --> 02:13:46.986 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS THAT THERE MAY BE SOME

02:13:44.183 --> 02:13:47.753 region:rollup2
FUNDS TO HELP US REACH OUR GOAL

02:13:46.986 --> 02:13:49.588 region:rollup2
OF ENSURING THE SUICIDE HOTLINE

02:13:47.753 --> 02:13:51.257 region:rollup2

02:13:57.463 --> 02:14:00.833 region:rollup2
SUICIDE PREVENTION HOTLINES I AM

02:13:59.198 --> 02:14:01.934 region:rollup2
AWARE THAT THE SUICIDE

02:14:00.833 --> 02:14:03.202 region:rollup2

INVESTMENTS OVER MULTI YEAR

02:14:08.607 --> 02:14:12.645 region:rollup2
PERIOD EACH COUNTY WAS GIVEN THE

02:14:10.943 --> 02:14:13.979 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE OR NOT

02:14:12.645 --> 02:14:15.347 region:rollup2
AND TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:17.716 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS AND A NUMBER OF

02:14:15.347 --> 02:14:19.385 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE IN FACT CONTINUING.

02:14:17.716 --> 02:14:21.086 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:14:19.385 --> 02:14:22.755 region:rollup2
SOME OF THESE KIND OF SIGNATURE

02:14:21.086 --> 02:14:25.291 region:rollup2
PREVENTION CAMPAIGNS.

02:14:22.755 --> 02:14:26.592 region:rollup2
OTHERS NOT BECAUSE OF EITHER

02:14:25.291 --> 02:14:28.627 region:rollup2
OTHER LOCAL PRIORITIES THEY

02:14:26.592 --> 02:14:29.962 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE TO DO PREVENTION AT

02:14:28.627 --> 02:14:31.163 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT NOT TO GET

02:14:29.962 --> 02:14:32.665 region:rollup2
BACK TO YOU ON THE COUNTY

02:14:31.163 --> 02:14:34.233 region:rollup2
SUPPORT OF THE HOTLINE SINCE

02:14:32.665 --> 02:14:36.468 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE GREAT AND IF I MADE

02:14:34.233 --> 02:14:37.503 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR CAN'T GET A RESPONSE ON

02:14:36.468 --> 02:14:38.671 region:rollup2
WHY.

02:14:37.503 --> 02:14:41.674 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS OF FISCAL

02:14:38.671 --> 02:14:44.043 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATIONS HAVE NOT.

02:14:41.674 --> 02:14:45.778 region:rollup2
RENDERED ANNALS AND HOP SURE SO

02:14:44.043 --> 02:14:46.478 region:rollup2
AND TO BE CLEAR WHEN YOUR WEB

02:14:45.778 --> 02:14:47.746 region:rollup2
FUNDING WAS RECEIVED

02:14:46.478 --> 02:14:49.181 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

02:14:47.746 --> 02:14:50.683 region:rollup2
LAST YEAR.

02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:51.784 region:rollup2
AND I WOULD SHARE THE

02:14:50.683 --> 02:14:53.185 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION IN TERMS OF THE

02:14:51.784 --> 02:14:54.286 region:rollup2
CONTRACT NEGOTIATION HAS BEEN

02:14:53.185 --> 02:14:55.888 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:57.823 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN.

02:14:55.888 --> 02:15:00.192 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN STATE

02:14:57.823 --> 02:15:01.260 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING LA THAT WE DON'T.

02:15:00.192 --> 02:15:02.661 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T NECESSARILY CONTROL

02:15:01.260 --> 02:15:04.663 region:rollup2
BUT WE CERTAINLY FOLLOW THROUGH

02:15:02.661 --> 02:15:06.899 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT GENERAL SERVICES.

02:15:04.663 --> 02:15:09.201 region:rollup2
THERE'S ALLOWABLE COSTS THEY'RE

02:15:06.899 --> 02:15:11.036 region:rollup2
ALLOWED TO BE USED IN EXPENDED

02:15:09.201 --> 02:15:13.272 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WERE

02:15:11.036 --> 02:15:14.907 region:rollup2
REFERENCE BY THE. TESTIMONY ARE

02:15:13.272 --> 02:15:15.908 region:rollup2
NOT ALLOWABLE AND SO THAT HAS

02:15:14.907 --> 02:15:16.508 region:rollup2
BEEN PART OF THE NEGOTIATION

02:15:15.908 --> 02:15:18.677 region:rollup2
BETWEEN US AND THE CONTRACTOR

02:15:16.508 --> 02:15:20.245 region:rollup2
IS.

02:15:18.677 --> 02:15:21.880 region:rollup2
THIS THERE ARE STATE CONTRACTING

02:15:20.245 --> 02:15:23.649 region:rollup2
RULES THAT SAY WE CAN'T PAY FOR

02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:25.417 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS AND SO WE'RE

02:15:23.649 --> 02:15:28.053 region:rollup2
HOPEFUL I'M WE WERE TRYING TO

02:15:25.417 --> 02:15:29.488 region:rollup2
CLOSE NEGOTIATIONS LAST WEEK.

02:15:28.053 --> 02:15:30.856 region:rollup2
AND WE HAD TENDERED DONE IT

02:15:29.488 --> 02:15:31.957 region:rollup2
WOULD CUT CONTRACTOR YOU TALKING

02:15:30.856 --> 02:15:33.158 region:rollup2
LIKE CAN YOU EXPLAIN THAT I'M

02:15:31.957 --> 02:15:34.627 region:rollup2
THE PERSON THAT JUST TESTIFIED

02:15:33.158 --> 02:15:36.628 region:rollup2
FROM DIDI HIRSCH IS THE

02:15:34.627 --> 02:15:38.230 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR OKAY.

02:15:36.628 --> 02:15:39.231 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S DIFFERENT CONTRACTORS

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:40.699 region:rollup2
ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS WHAT

02:15:39.231 --> 02:15:42.201 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S ONE

02:15:40.699 --> 02:15:43.636 region:rollup2
OKAY DE HIRSCH BUT. NONE OF JUST

02:15:42.201 --> 02:15:45.871 region:rollup2
AS WE TALKED ABOUT BREEDING A

02:15:43.636 --> 02:15:48.340 region:rollup2
FUNDS EARLIER THERE IS AN

02:15:45.871 --> 02:15:49.041 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR US IF COUNTIES

02:15:48.340 --> 02:15:50.509 region:rollup2
WERE WILLING.

02:15:49.041 --> 02:15:52.311 region:rollup2
TO BRAID FUNDS TO HELP ENSURE

02:15:50.509 --> 02:15:52.878 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WAS COMING OUT BECAUSE

02:15:52.311 --> 02:15:54.747 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS DO NOT HAVE THE

02:15:52.878 --> 02:15:56.348 region:rollup2
SAME.

02:15:54.747 --> 02:15:59.418 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS AS MY UNDERSTANDING

02:15:56.348 --> 02:16:01.020 region:rollup2
IS THAT CORRECT.

02:15:59.418 --> 02:16:01.720 region:rollup2
IF COUNTY YET IF YOU'RE USING TO

02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:03.622 region:rollup2
DATE UNDER THEIR STATE

02:16:01.720 --> 02:16:06.025 region:rollup2
CONTRACTING RULES SO IF YOU'RE

02:16:03.622 --> 02:16:07.593 region:rollup2
NOT USING STATE FUNDS THEN. IF

02:16:06.025 --> 02:16:08.594 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES HAVE DIFFERENT

02:16:07.593 --> 02:16:09.828 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS BUT.

02:16:08.594 --> 02:16:10.729 region:rollup2
RIGHT THE NEGOTIATIONS WERE

02:16:09.828 --> 02:16:12.564 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF

02:16:10.729 --> 02:16:13.599 region:rollup2
CERTAIN.

02:16:12.564 --> 02:16:14.767 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AROUND WHAT

02:16:13.599 --> 02:16:16.635 region:rollup2
WE CAN AND CAN'T.

02:16:14.767 --> 02:16:18.671 region:rollup2
YOU STATE FUNDING FOR

02:16:16.635 --> 02:16:21.240 region:rollup2
SO ALLOW ME TO PUT A PEN EN AND

02:16:18.671 --> 02:16:22.608 region:rollup2
SAD LIKE TO COME BACK TO A

02:16:21.240 --> 02:16:24.710 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WITH EUNICE BARLOW

02:16:22.608 --> 02:16:26.612 region:rollup2
LATER ON TO SEE IF THERE'S. AN

02:16:24.710 --> 02:16:28.280 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO ENSURE

02:16:26.612 --> 02:16:29.948 region:rollup2
THAT THIS NEEDED EVIDENCE BASED

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:33.218 region:rollup2
PROGRAM IS IMPLEMENTABLE.

02:16:29.948 --> 02:16:35.454 region:rollup2
FOR OUR STATE.

02:16:33.218 --> 02:16:36.288 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST A COMMENT THOUGH I SO

02:16:35.454 --> 02:16:36.889 region:rollup2
CALLED BACK TO THE BUREAUCRACY

02:16:36.288 --> 02:16:39.525 region:rollup2
PART.

02:16:36.889 --> 02:16:42.528 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE'S A A CLEAR SET OF

02:16:39.525 --> 02:16:43.562 region:rollup2
OF OUR ALLOW BULLS THEN THERE

02:16:42.528 --> 02:16:44.963 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE NO NEGOTIATION RIGHT.

02:16:43.562 --> 02:16:46.799 region:rollup2
SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

02:16:44.963 --> 02:16:48.701 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ABOUT BUT DIFFICULTY

02:16:46.799 --> 02:16:50.803 region:rollup2
OVER NEGOTIATIONS IF THERE'S A A

02:16:48.701 --> 02:16:51.637 region:rollup2
SET STANDARD. BACK TO MY REPORT

02:16:50.803 --> 02:16:53.038 region:rollup2
CARD.

02:16:51.637 --> 02:16:55.741 region:rollup2
AND OLOGY IS.

02:16:53.038 --> 02:16:56.608 region:rollup2
I KNOW IF YOU GET EIGHTY

02:16:55.741 --> 02:16:57.876 region:rollup2
PERCENT THAT'S BE IF YOU GET

02:16:56.608 --> 02:17:00.179 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT AND ABOVE THAT'S

02:16:57.876 --> 02:17:01.013 region:rollup2
AND EIGHTY AND IT'S VERY CLEAR.

02:17:00.179 --> 02:17:02.581 region:rollup2
WILL THERE WOULD THERE SHOULD BE

02:17:01.013 --> 02:17:04.550 region:rollup2
NO NEGOTIATION BACK AND FORTH IN

02:17:02.581 --> 02:17:05.617 region:rollup2
MY OPINION. OUT UNLESS THERE'S

02:17:04.550 --> 02:17:06.919 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I'M MISSING

02:17:05.617 --> 02:17:08.153 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE BOOK I BARELY MISSING

02:17:06.919 --> 02:17:09.788 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WELL THERE'S A REASON

02:17:08.153 --> 02:17:10.923 region:rollup2
WHY WE HAVEN'T SIGNED A CONTRACT

02:17:09.788 --> 02:17:12.658 region:rollup2
IS THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS THAT

02:17:10.923 --> 02:17:13.926 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT PAY FOR AND THAT

02:17:12.658 --> 02:17:14.927 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR HAS WANTED THEM PAID

02:17:13.926 --> 02:17:16.628 region:rollup2
FOR SO THEY HAVEN'T SIGNED THE

02:17:14.927 --> 02:17:17.629 region:rollup2
CONTRACT AND SO THAT'S. WHY WE

02:17:16.628 --> 02:17:20.065 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE ONE YET WE WOULD LIKE

02:17:17.629 --> 02:17:22.935 region:rollup2
THERE TO BE A CONTRACT SO I HE I

02:17:20.065 --> 02:17:24.269 region:rollup2
SEE IN THE BACK? NODS OF NO

02:17:22.935 --> 02:17:25.904 region:rollup2
THAT'S NOT CORRECT.

02:17:24.269 --> 02:17:27.639 region:rollup2
SO HOW IS IT THAT I CAN GET THE

02:17:25.904 --> 02:17:29.441 region:rollup2
EXACT INFORMATION AND MAYBE

02:17:27.639 --> 02:17:30.843 region:rollup2
YOU'LL AND AND THE CONTRACTOR IN

TALK THIS OUT WE COULD DO IT

02:17:31.643 --> 02:17:34.379 region:rollup2
HERE. FROM.

02:17:33.245 --> 02:17:36.715 region:rollup2
OR WE CAN DO IT.

02:17:34.379 --> 02:17:38.550 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW PERHAPS OFF SITE AND

02:17:36.715 --> 02:17:39.752 region:rollup2
AND SOMEBODY'S OFFICE SO THAT

02:17:38.550 --> 02:17:41.153 region:rollup2
I'M ABLE TO HEAR BECAUSE IT'S

02:17:39.752 --> 02:17:44.056 region:rollup2
NOT MAKING SENSE. AND SO.

02:17:41.153 --> 02:17:46.658 region:rollup2
JUST.

02:17:44.056 --> 02:17:49.762 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE.

02:17:46.658 --> 02:17:51.363 region:rollup2
AND I.

02:17:49.762 --> 02:17:53.365 region:rollup2

BLAMING THEM. OUT FOR THIS AND

02:17:59.505 --> 02:18:02.808 region:rollup2
SO AM I BLAMING THEM TO BE FAIR

02:18:00.672 --> 02:18:04.476 region:rollup2

WHEN I SEE THEM.

02:18:04.476 --> 02:18:08.013 region:rollup2
SAYING NO AND YOU SAYING YES

02:18:08.013 --> 02:18:11.083 region:rollup2
.

02:18:09.882 --> 02:18:12.584 region:rollup2

RULES FOR A LONG TIME.

02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:32.037 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THIS IS OUR FIRST TIME

02:18:30.769 --> 02:18:35.174 region:rollup2

02:24:07.005 --> 02:24:09.307 region:rollup2
HOTLINES.

02:24:08.139 --> 02:24:11.510 region:rollup2
TRUE OR FALSE

02:24:09.307 --> 02:24:13.845 region:rollup2
THAT IS CORRECT

02:24:11.510 --> 02:24:14.479 region:rollup2
WITH OKAY MOTION LANGUAGE SO'S

02:24:13.845 --> 02:24:16.281 region:rollup2
WORTH OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS.

02:24:14.479 --> 02:24:18.517 region:rollup2
SO.

02:24:16.281 --> 02:24:20.619 region:rollup2
BOTTOM LINE.

02:24:18.517 --> 02:24:22.220 region:rollup2
IS

02:24:20.619 --> 02:24:24.689 region:rollup2
THAT'S EIGHT POINT THREE MILLION

02:24:22.220 --> 02:24:26.625 region:rollup2
IN THE LAST TWO YEARS CORRECT.

02:24:24.689 --> 02:24:28.026 region:rollup2
WITH A SLIGHT CLARIFICATION

02:24:26.625 --> 02:24:29.728 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDE A PROVISIONAL

02:24:28.026 --> 02:24:31.062 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE TO STIPULATE THAT THERE

02:24:29.728 --> 02:24:32.831 region:rollup2
WERE SUFFICIENT RESOURCES IN THE

02:24:31.062 --> 02:24:34.466 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATIVE CAP.

02:24:32.831 --> 02:24:36.601 region:rollup2
SO PROVIDED THAT THERE WERE

02:24:34.466 --> 02:24:38.036 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT RESOURCES BUT THOSE

02:24:36.601 --> 02:24:39.905 region:rollup2
FINDINGS WOULD THOSE FUNDS OR

02:24:38.036 --> 02:24:41.339 region:rollup2
ALL SEEN THAT THE STATE BUDGET

02:24:39.905 --> 02:24:43.108 region:rollup2
HAS GONE FROM YOU KNOW THE

02:24:41.339 --> 02:24:44.409 region:rollup2
EIGHTH LARGEST ECONOMY TO THE

02:24:43.108 --> 02:24:45.710 region:rollup2
FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE

02:24:44.409 --> 02:24:46.478 region:rollup2
LAST COUPLE YEARS I THINK

02:24:45.710 --> 02:24:48.213 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SUFFICIENT FUNDS.

02:24:46.478 --> 02:24:50.182 region:rollup2
ARM.

02:24:48.213 --> 02:24:53.485 region:rollup2
TO.

02:24:50.182 --> 02:24:56.521 region:rollup2
HE HEARS WHAT QUITE FRANKLY IS

02:24:53.485 --> 02:24:58.823 region:rollup2
REALLY IRRITATING FOR ME. IS I I

02:24:56.521 --> 02:25:01.126 region:rollup2
KNOW MYSELF I KNOW THE CHAIRMAN.

02:24:58.823 --> 02:25:02.994 region:rollup2
ALL QUITE A FEW MEMBERS IN THIS

02:25:01.126 --> 02:25:05.130 region:rollup2
BUILDING WORK VERY VERY HARD

02:25:02.994 --> 02:25:06.398 region:rollup2
OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS.

02:25:05.130 --> 02:25:07.732 region:rollup2
THE PUSH FOR VETERANS WHO SITE

02:25:06.398 --> 02:25:09.334 region:rollup2
AWARENESS TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:25:07.732 --> 02:25:09.935 region:rollup2
THERE'S A MANDATE IN PLACE TO

02:25:09.334 --> 02:25:11.636 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY

02:25:09.935 --> 02:25:12.904 region:rollup2
COUNTING THAT'S.

02:25:11.636 --> 02:25:14.439 region:rollup2
IFYOU JUST TAKE THAT SIMPLE

02:25:12.904 --> 02:25:16.141 region:rollup2
NUMBERS TWENTY TWO VETERAN

02:25:14.439 --> 02:25:17.209 region:rollup2
SUICIDE THE DAY.

02:25:16.141 --> 02:25:19.244 region:rollup2
ANY A MULTIPLIER THAT OUT FOR

02:25:17.209 --> 02:25:22.247 region:rollup2
TWO YEARS.

02:25:19.244 --> 02:25:24.516 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER IS SIXTEEN THOUSAND.

02:25:22.247 --> 02:25:26.284 region:rollup2
SIXTY VETERAN SUICIDE.

02:25:24.516 --> 02:25:29.821 region:rollup2
SO WHILE YOU ALL CAN'T FIGURE

02:25:26.284 --> 02:25:30.956 region:rollup2
OUT WHAT CONTRACT IS WHAT IT.

02:25:29.821 --> 02:25:31.957 region:rollup2
THAT'S VETERANS DYING ON THE

02:25:30.956 --> 02:25:34.159 region:rollup2
STREETS NOT TO INCLUDE EVERYBODY

02:25:31.957 --> 02:25:35.026 region:rollup2
ELSE WHO NEEDS HELP.

02:25:34.159 --> 02:25:36.261 region:rollup2
WELL LOOK FORWARD TO THE

02:25:35.026 --> 02:25:37.562 region:rollup2
CONTINUED DISCUSSION TO GETTING

02:25:36.261 --> 02:25:39.097 region:rollup2
THIS RIGHT.

02:25:37.562 --> 02:25:40.665 region:rollup2
WEATHER WE NEED TO CHECK WAY

02:25:39.097 --> 02:25:42.767 region:rollup2
THAT THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION

02:25:40.665 --> 02:25:44.569 region:rollup2
OR WHAT HAVE YOU.

02:25:42.767 --> 02:25:46.071 region:rollup2
BUT I'M NOT OKAY WITH PEOPLE

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:47.505 region:rollup2
DIED FROM SUICIDE ON OUR STREETS

02:25:46.071 --> 02:25:52.877 region:rollup2
BECAUSE YOU ALL CAN'T FIGURE OUT

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:53.111 region:rollup2
CONTRACTS.

02:25:52.877 --> 02:25:54.613 region:rollup2
I THINK.

02:25:53.111 --> 02:25:56.681 region:rollup2
.

02:25:54.613 --> 02:25:57.916 region:rollup2
IF I.

02:25:56.681 --> 02:26:00.685 region:rollup2
MAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS.

02:25:57.916 --> 02:26:03.321 region:rollup2
THE TWENTY TO VETERANS IS A.

02:26:00.685 --> 02:26:06.057 region:rollup2
NATIONWIDE BUT YOUR.

02:26:03.321 --> 02:26:09.561 region:rollup2
SENTIMENT IS APPROPRIATE.

02:26:06.057 --> 02:26:11.496 region:rollup2
IF I MAY ASK THE DEPARTMENT TO

02:26:09.561 --> 02:26:14.232 region:rollup2
WORK WITH US AND FIGURE OUT HOW

02:26:11.496 --> 02:26:15.967 region:rollup2
WE CAN GET PAST THIS ISSUE. SO

02:26:14.232 --> 02:26:18.903 region:rollup2
WE CAN HELP TO APPROPRIATE THOSE

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:20.372 region:rollup2
FUNDS. AND WE KNOW AS WAS STATED

02:26:18.903 --> 02:26:22.607 region:rollup2
EARLIER WE HAVE THE FUNDS WITHIN

02:26:20.372 --> 02:26:24.142 region:rollup2
OUR STATE ADMINISTRATION WE NEED

02:26:22.607 --> 02:26:26.211 region:rollup2

02:26:24.142 --> 02:26:26.978 region:rollup2
HOW WE ENSURE THAT THIS HOTLINE

02:26:26.211 --> 02:26:29.214 region:rollup2
IS AFFECT

02:26:26.978 --> 02:26:30.682 region:rollup2
SO WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE

02:26:29.214 --> 02:26:38.990 region:rollup2
THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE

02:26:30.682 --> 02:26:55.340 region:rollup2

HE WE HAVE WE AS I DESCRIBED

02:27:58.803 --> 02:28:01.072 region:rollup2
THINK THE BEST ANALOGY AS WE ARE

02:27:59.838 --> 02:28:02.507 region:rollup2
LIKE A MENTAL HEALTH GRAND JURY

02:28:01.072 --> 02:28:03.675 region:rollup2
BUT OVER THE YEARS THE

02:28:02.507 --> 02:28:04.876 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN THE

02:28:03.675 --> 02:28:07.645 region:rollup2
COMMISSION SOME VERY SPECIFIC

02:28:04.876 --> 02:28:09.247 region:rollup2
AUTHORITIES. THAT ARE UNLIKE A

02:28:07.645 --> 02:28:10.882 region:rollup2
GRAND JURY AYE WE REVIEW AND

02:28:09.247 --> 02:28:12.083 region:rollup2
APPROVE COUNTY INNOVATION PLANS.

02:28:10.882 --> 02:28:14.386 region:rollup2
AND YOU'VE HEARD SOME OF THE

02:28:12.083 --> 02:28:15.987 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION. OF THE MONEY THAT

02:28:14.386 --> 02:28:17.422 region:rollup2
IS SUBJECT AB ONE FOURTEEN IT IS

02:28:15.987 --> 02:28:19.224 region:rollup2
NORTH OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION

02:28:17.422 --> 02:28:21.259 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF

02:28:19.224 --> 02:28:22.761 region:rollup2
THAT IS INNOVATION MONEY ABOUT

02:28:21.259 --> 02:28:23.795 region:rollup2
FORTY PERCENT OF THAT IS P. E.

02:28:22.761 --> 02:28:24.662 region:rollup2
I. OR CSS.

02:28:23.795 --> 02:28:27.432 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION DOES REVIEW AND

02:28:24.662 --> 02:28:29.067 region:rollup2
APPROVE INNOVATION DOLLARS OUR

02:28:27.432 --> 02:28:30.769 region:rollup2
RESEARCH IN AND WE SHARED THIS

02:28:29.067 --> 02:28:32.170 region:rollup2
WITH THE AUDITOR AND SHOWS THAT

02:28:30.769 --> 02:28:33.738 region:rollup2
OUR OUR REVIEW PROCESS IS ABOUT

02:28:32.170 --> 02:28:35.106 region:rollup2
SIXTY FIVE DAYS.

02:28:33.738 --> 02:28:37.008 region:rollup2
AND SO THE AUDITOR CONCLUDED

02:28:35.106 --> 02:28:37.809 region:rollup2
THAT DELAYS ON OUR SIDE ARE NOT

02:28:37.008 --> 02:28:38.743 region:rollup2
THE REASON WHY COUNTIES ARE

02:28:37.809 --> 02:28:40.378 region:rollup2
SPENDING THESE FUNDS IN FACT

02:28:38.743 --> 02:28:41.679 region:rollup2
THERE ARE. THINGS SEVEN COUNTIES

02:28:40.378 --> 02:28:43.081 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE LATEST RESEARCH

02:28:41.679 --> 02:28:43.615 region:rollup2
THAT HAVE NEVER BROUGHT AN

02:28:43.081 --> 02:28:46.317 region:rollup2
INNOVATION PLAN BEFORE THE

02:28:43.615 --> 02:28:47.719 region:rollup2
COMMISSION.

02:28:46.317 --> 02:28:48.319 region:rollup2
AS YOU'VE SEEN IN THE IN THE

02:28:47.719 --> 02:28:48.987 region:rollup2
PACKET SOME OF THE SOME OF THE

02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:50.422 region:rollup2
FURTHER ITEMS WE ARE WORKING TO

02:28:48.987 --> 02:28:51.756 region:rollup2
STREAMLINE THIS PROCESS WHAT WE

02:28:50.422 --> 02:28:52.957 region:rollup2
REALLY WANT IS INNOVATION TO BE

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:54.425 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

02:28:52.957 --> 02:28:56.161 region:rollup2
THAT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT

02:28:54.425 --> 02:28:57.695 region:rollup2
THE LANGUAGE OF THE OF THE

02:28:56.161 --> 02:28:59.063 region:rollup2
POLICY IS QUITE ELEGANT.

02:28:57.695 --> 02:29:00.832 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS PUSHING OUR SYSTEM

02:28:59.063 --> 02:29:01.666 region:rollup2
TO BE PREVENTION ORIENTED TO TO

02:29:00.832 --> 02:29:03.701 region:rollup2
REALLY FOCUS ON EARLY

02:29:01.666 --> 02:29:05.203 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION AND IT SEES THIS

02:29:03.701 --> 02:29:06.371 region:rollup2
THIS SIR. SIGNIFICANT

02:29:05.203 --> 02:29:08.339 region:rollup2
INVESTMENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:29:06.371 --> 02:29:09.374 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OVERALL

02:29:08.339 --> 02:29:11.075 region:rollup2
IT'S ABOUT ONE TO ONE AND A HALF

02:29:09.374 --> 02:29:12.410 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF MENTAL HEALTH DOLLARS

02:29:11.075 --> 02:29:14.546 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY

02:29:12.410 --> 02:29:16.681 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE THE WAY. WE DELIVER

02:29:14.546 --> 02:29:18.383 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO REALLY DRIVE TOWARD

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:19.484 region:rollup2
BETTER OUTCOMES BETTER

02:29:18.383 --> 02:29:21.119 region:rollup2
EFFICIENCIES N TERMS OF THAT

02:29:19.484 --> 02:29:23.221 region:rollup2
CARE AND AND WE'RE STRUGGLING TO

02:29:21.119 --> 02:29:24.389 region:rollup2
DO THAT BUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT

02:29:23.221 --> 02:29:26.357 region:rollup2
THAT IN THE LATER AND AN ITEM.

02:29:24.389 --> 02:29:29.260 region:rollup2
WE DO A FEW OTHER THINGS.

02:29:26.357 --> 02:29:30.328 region:rollup2
WE HAVE WE HAVE TRIAGE FUNDS

02:29:29.260 --> 02:29:33.598 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ALSO ON YOUR AGENDA

02:29:30.328 --> 02:29:35.400 region:rollup2
ITEM WE SEE THOSE AS A VERY

02:29:33.598 --> 02:29:36.034 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT TOOL WHICH TO THOSE

02:29:35.400 --> 02:29:36.868 region:rollup2
HAS INCENTIVE FUNDS.

02:29:36.034 --> 02:29:38.570 region:rollup2
WAYS THAT WE CAN REALLY

02:29:36.868 --> 02:29:40.371 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGE PUSH OR INCENTIVIZE

02:29:38.570 --> 02:29:41.973 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO TRY THINGS THAT THEY

02:29:40.371 --> 02:29:43.641 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE DOING ON THEIR OWN.

02:29:41.973 --> 02:29:45.944 region:rollup2
AND SO RECENTLY THE COMMISSION

02:29:43.641 --> 02:29:47.245 region:rollup2
THROUGH ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION

02:29:45.944 --> 02:29:48.880 region:rollup2
DEDICATED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:29:47.245 --> 02:29:50.114 region:rollup2
OF THOSE FUNDS TO SUPPORT SCHOOL

02:29:48.880 --> 02:29:51.783 region:rollup2
COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS.

02:29:50.114 --> 02:29:53.318 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IN WORK THAT WE HAVE

02:29:51.783 --> 02:29:54.452 region:rollup2
DONE AROUND KIDS IN CRISIS WE'RE

02:29:53.318 --> 02:29:55.920 region:rollup2
FINDING THAT CHILDREN OFTEN

02:29:54.452 --> 02:29:57.589 region:rollup2
PRESENT IN CRISIS IN A SCHOOL

02:29:55.920 --> 02:29:58.790 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENT RIGHT THERE ARE

02:29:57.589 --> 02:29:59.657 region:rollup2
THOSE CRISES AT THREE IN THE

02:29:58.790 --> 02:30:01.593 region:rollup2
MORNING WHERE THE CALLING NINE

02:29:59.657 --> 02:30:02.760 region:rollup2
ONE ONE. THE QUITE OFTEN IT IS

02:30:01.593 --> 02:30:03.862 region:rollup2
IN A SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT WE'VE

02:30:02.760 --> 02:30:05.029 region:rollup2
HEARD HORROR STORIES

02:30:03.862 --> 02:30:06.898 region:rollup2
OF SCHOOLS CALLING LAW

THE WORK THAT THAT REALLY LED TO

MANY CALIFORNIANS CONTINUE TO

THINGS AS WE TALKED ABOUT TO

02:31:08.092 --> 02:31:10.428 region:rollup2
REALLY MAKE IT EASIER TO

02:31:09.160 --> 02:31:11.462 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND WHERE THE MONEY'S

02:31:10.428 --> 02:31:11.996 region:rollup2
COMING FROM WHERE IT'S GOING

02:31:11.462 --> 02:31:12.931 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THE

02:31:11.996 --> 02:31:14.599 region:rollup2
MONEY.

02:31:12.931 --> 02:31:17.502 region:rollup2
VERY CHALLENGING AND AND TO THE

02:31:14.599 --> 02:31:19.504 region:rollup2
CHAIRS CORE QUESTION OF AND WE

02:31:17.502 --> 02:31:22.140 region:rollup2
DO NOT YET HAVE THOSE METRICS

02:31:19.504 --> 02:31:22.774 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH THE STATE HAS BEEN

02:31:22.140 --> 02:31:22.974 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING SINCE NINETEEN NINETY

02:31:22.774 --> 02:31:23.641 region:rollup2
ONE.

02:31:22.974 --> 02:31:25.577 region:rollup2
TO COME UP WITH AGREED UPON SET

02:31:23.641 --> 02:31:26.878 region:rollup2
OF INDICATORS THAT ALLOW THE

02:31:25.577 --> 02:31:28.046 region:rollup2
GENERAL PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND.

02:31:26.878 --> 02:31:29.147 region:rollup2
WELL WE'RE PUTTING MORE MONEY

02:31:28.046 --> 02:31:32.083 region:rollup2
INTO THE SYSTEM WE HAVE MORE

02:31:29.147 --> 02:31:32.684 region:rollup2
NEEDS ARE WE GETTING BETTER AT

02:31:32.083 --> 02:31:33.818 region:rollup2
SERVING THOSE NEEDS AND THAT

02:31:32.684 --> 02:31:34.919 region:rollup2
CONTINUES TO BE CHALLENGING BUT

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:36.287 region:rollup2
I BUT I THINK.

02:31:34.919 --> 02:31:37.889 region:rollup2
WERE MAKING PROBABLY MORE

02:31:36.287 --> 02:31:39.624 region:rollup2
PROGRESS IN CALIFORNIA THAN IN

02:31:37.889 --> 02:31:40.692 region:rollup2
ANY OTHER STATE IN PART BECAUSE

02:31:39.624 --> 02:31:43.227 region:rollup2
OF THE NATURE OF THE MENTAL

02:31:40.692 --> 02:31:44.262 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES ACT AND THE FACT

02:31:43.227 --> 02:31:45.630 region:rollup2
THAT THAT YOU HAVE THIS.

02:31:44.262 --> 02:31:47.565 region:rollup2
UNIQUE STATE LEVEL MENTAL HEALTH

02:31:45.630 --> 02:31:49.367 region:rollup2
GRAND JURY THAT IS WORKING ON

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:52.804 region:rollup2
THIS AND AND NOT TRYING TO RUN A

02:31:49.367 --> 02:31:53.604 region:rollup2
SYSTEM WHILE ALSO OVERSEAS.

02:31:52.804 --> 02:31:54.205 region:rollup2
IT'S KINDA MIGHTN'T BROAD

02:31:53.604 --> 02:31:56.941 region:rollup2
OVERVIEW OF IT HAPPEN RESPOND

02:31:54.205 --> 02:31:58.810 region:rollup2
ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE.

02:31:56.941 --> 02:31:59.611 region:rollup2
GREAT THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF

FINANCE ALLOW ANY COMMENTS ON

02:31:59.611 --> 02:32:01.980 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR.

02:32:00.745 --> 02:32:05.350 region:rollup2
WE'LL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON

02:32:01.980 --> 02:32:07.018 region:rollup2
ISSUE FOR THIS TIME.

02:32:05.350 --> 02:32:08.853 region:rollup2
SAYING NONO BRING IT UP TO THE

02:32:07.018 --> 02:32:10.021 region:rollup2
DIETS AND ASKED QUESTION THAT WE

02:32:08.853 --> 02:32:11.556 region:rollup2
HAVE BEFORE US.

02:32:10.021 --> 02:32:13.057 region:rollup2
THERE.

02:32:11.556 --> 02:32:14.826 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS TO BE A DECREASE IN

02:32:13.057 --> 02:32:16.761 region:rollup2
YOUR BUDGET AND WANTED YOU TO

02:32:14.826 --> 02:32:18.096 region:rollup2
SEE IF YOU COULD EXPLAIN WHAT

02:32:16.761 --> 02:32:19.931 region:rollup2
WAS THE RATIONALE BEHIND THAT.

02:32:18.096 --> 02:32:21.265 region:rollup2
YEAH PRIMARILY THAT'S BECAUSE

02:32:19.931 --> 02:32:23.501 region:rollup2
THEY WERE IN THERE ONE TIME

02:32:21.265 --> 02:32:25.269 region:rollup2
INCREASES IN PRIOR YEARS.

02:32:23.501 --> 02:32:26.471 region:rollup2
THERE WAS FUNDING THAT THE

02:32:25.269 --> 02:32:27.538 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE MADE AVAILABLE

02:32:26.471 --> 02:32:28.706 region:rollup2
COUPLE OF YEARS AGO ON A ONE

02:32:27.538 --> 02:32:30.108 region:rollup2
TIME BASIS SUBJECT TO THE

02:32:28.706 --> 02:32:31.109 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY OF THE FUNDS.

02:32:30.108 --> 02:32:32.944 region:rollup2
AND SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT

02:32:31.109 --> 02:32:34.178 region:rollup2
SO THE DECLINE IS NOT A DECLINE

02:32:32.944 --> 02:32:36.414 region:rollup2
IN THE COR IN OUR CORE OPERATING

02:32:34.178 --> 02:32:38.883 region:rollup2
BUDGET IT'S A REFLECTION OF

02:32:36.414 --> 02:32:39.484 region:rollup2
THESE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES THAT

02:32:38.883 --> 02:32:40.318 region:rollup2
ARE NO LONGER REFLECTED IN THE

02:32:39.484 --> 02:32:42.720 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

02:32:40.318 --> 02:32:44.255 region:rollup2
I'M FROM THE OUTSIDE THE OF

02:32:42.720 --> 02:32:46.457 region:rollup2
APPEARANCES THAT WERE DECREASING

02:32:44.255 --> 02:32:48.960 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT IN LIGHT OF WHAT WE

02:32:46.457 --> 02:32:50.128 region:rollup2
FOUND IN OUR LAST AUDIT AND.

02:32:48.960 --> 02:32:51.863 region:rollup2
WE'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY IF YOU

02:32:50.128 --> 02:32:53.398 region:rollup2
LIKE TO REMEDY THAT. MISTER

02:32:51.863 --> 02:32:54.866 region:rollup2
CHAIR.

02:32:53.398 --> 02:32:56.834 region:rollup2
WAS NOT MY SUGGESTION BUT I

02:32:54.866 --> 02:32:58.236 region:rollup2
APPRECIATE THE INPUT.

02:32:56.834 --> 02:33:00.071 region:rollup2
THE HOME CINCO MORE FURTHER

02:32:58.236 --> 02:33:01.105 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ON ISSUE FOR WE WILL

02:33:00.071 --> 02:33:02.373 region:rollup2
HOLD THIS ITEM OPEN AND MOVE ON

02:33:01.105 --> 02:33:04.275 region:rollup2
TO ISSUE FIVE.

02:33:02.373 --> 02:33:07.512 region:rollup2
GREAT.

02:33:04.275 --> 02:33:08.212 region:rollup2
.

02:33:07.512 --> 02:33:12.517 region:rollup2
SO THAT SO.

02:33:08.212 --> 02:33:13.518 region:rollup2
.

02:33:12.517 --> 02:33:14.452 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE COMMISSION REVIEWS

02:33:13.518 --> 02:33:15.620 region:rollup2
AND APPROVING OF EIGHT PER

02:33:14.452 --> 02:33:18.589 region:rollup2
PROVES COUNTY INNOVATION

02:33:15.620 --> 02:33:20.091 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS RIGHT WE'VE BEEN.

02:33:18.589 --> 02:33:22.360 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO

02:33:20.091 --> 02:33:23.594 region:rollup2
REALLY UNDERSTAND WE KNOW WHAT

02:33:22.360 --> 02:33:25.229 region:rollup2
ARE SOME OF THE BARRIERS TO

02:33:23.594 --> 02:33:26.531 region:rollup2
USING THESE DOLLARS EFFECTIVELY.

02:33:25.229 --> 02:33:28.399 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE COMMISSION.

02:33:26.531 --> 02:33:30.101 region:rollup2
HAS IDENTIFIED FOUR KEY

02:33:28.399 --> 02:33:33.337 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

02:33:30.101 --> 02:33:33.971 region:rollup2
FIRST WE'RE NOT SEEING WELL IT

02:33:33.337 --> 02:33:35.039 region:rollup2
START THIS IS STARTING TO HAPPEN

02:33:33.971 --> 02:33:36.140 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:33:35.039 --> 02:33:37.075 region:rollup2
TRADITIONALLY WE WERE NOT SEEING

02:33:36.140 --> 02:33:38.843 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT WERE COMING

02:33:37.075 --> 02:33:40.111 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AROUND INNOVATION.

02:33:38.843 --> 02:33:41.979 region:rollup2
EACH COUNTY PREPARED INDIVIDUAL

02:33:40.111 --> 02:33:43.981 region:rollup2
INNOVATION PLANS AND THEY WERE

02:33:41.979 --> 02:33:45.483 region:rollup2
QUITE OFTEN FOR A FEW HUNDRED

02:33:43.981 --> 02:33:47.418 region:rollup2
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR A FEW

02:33:45.483 --> 02:33:47.618 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS AND THEY WERE

02:33:47.418 --> 02:33:49.187 region:rollup2
SMALL.

02:33:47.618 --> 02:33:51.322 region:rollup2
.

02:33:49.187 --> 02:33:53.558 region:rollup2
A TECHNICAL SORT OF YOU KNOW.

02:33:51.322 --> 02:33:55.593 region:rollup2
ADJUSTMENTS TO AN EXISTING

02:33:53.558 --> 02:33:57.361 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO MEET A GAP IN THEIR

02:33:55.593 --> 02:33:58.396 region:rollup2
SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM.

02:33:57.361 --> 02:34:00.598 region:rollup2
INNOVATION COMPONENT DEMENTIA

02:33:58.396 --> 02:34:02.366 region:rollup2
SAY WAS REALLY INTENDED TO DRIVE

02:34:00.598 --> 02:34:03.735 region:rollup2
TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE

02:34:02.366 --> 02:34:04.535 region:rollup2
BIG SHIFTS THAT WOULD BE

02:34:03.735 --> 02:34:06.104 region:rollup2
IMPACTFUL AT THE POPULATION

02:34:04.535 --> 02:34:08.072 region:rollup2
LEVEL.

02:34:06.104 --> 02:34:09.407 region:rollup2
AND SO THE COMMISSION IDENTIFIED

02:34:08.072 --> 02:34:10.341 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO REALLY BRING THE

02:34:09.407 --> 02:34:11.576 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TOGETHER AROUND SHARED

02:34:10.341 --> 02:34:14.378 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES

02:34:11.576 --> 02:34:15.046 region:rollup2
HOW CAN WE PULL THESE DOLLARS SO

02:34:14.378 --> 02:34:16.948 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN HAVE MORE IMPACTFUL

02:34:15.046 --> 02:34:18.850 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITIES.

02:34:16.948 --> 02:34:20.218 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO DO THAT WE WE TEND

02:34:18.850 --> 02:34:21.786 region:rollup2
TO SEE COUNTIES THAT ARE DOING

02:34:20.218 --> 02:34:22.787 region:rollup2
MINOR ADAPTATIONS

02:34:21.786 --> 02:34:24.555 region:rollup2
PART OF THE REASON FOR THAT WE

02:34:22.787 --> 02:34:25.990 region:rollup2
BELIEVE IS BECAUSE INNOVATION IS

02:34:24.555 --> 02:34:27.091 region:rollup2
HARD.

02:34:25.990 --> 02:34:28.059 region:rollup2
AND COUNTIES ARE PROPOSING

02:34:27.091 --> 02:34:29.427 region:rollup2
THINGS THAT THEY'RE MORE LIKE TO

02:34:28.059 --> 02:34:31.763 region:rollup2
BE SUCCESSFUL WITH

02:34:29.427 --> 02:34:32.663 region:rollup2
AND SOFIA WANT THEM TO BE EDGIER

02:34:31.763 --> 02:34:33.264 region:rollup2
IN THERE INNOVATIVE APPROACHES

02:34:32.663 --> 02:34:34.632 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO GIVE AND TECHNICAL

02:34:33.264 --> 02:34:36.033 region:rollup2
ASSISTANCE.

02:34:34.632 --> 02:34:37.068 region:rollup2
THAT THE ARTIST THE SECOND

02:34:36.033 --> 02:34:39.170 region:rollup2
CHALLENGE THE COMMISSION

02:34:37.068 --> 02:34:40.638 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED IS OF THE DIFFICULTY

02:34:39.170 --> 02:34:41.973 region:rollup2
OF EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF AN

02:34:40.638 --> 02:34:43.341 region:rollup2
INNOVATION OVER A TRADITIONAL

02:34:41.973 --> 02:34:45.776 region:rollup2
SERVICE.

02:34:43.341 --> 02:34:47.078 region:rollup2
IN PART BECAUSE VERY FEW

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:48.179 region:rollup2
ACCOUNTABLE HEALTH PROGRAMS

02:34:47.078 --> 02:34:49.580 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY HAVE IN HOUSE

02:34:48.179 --> 02:34:50.114 region:rollup2
EVALUATORS AND EVALUATION OF

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:51.315 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS ACTUALLY VERY

02:34:50.114 --> 02:34:52.950 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT.

02:34:51.315 --> 02:34:54.085 region:rollup2
IN THE FOURTH PIECES BECAUSE

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:56.154 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT DOING THOSE HIGH LEVEL

02:34:54.085 --> 02:34:58.022 region:rollup2
EVALUATIONS WE REALLY WANTED TO

02:34:56.154 --> 02:34:59.490 region:rollup2
DO THE DISSEMINATION SO THAT THE

02:34:58.022 --> 02:34:59.924 region:rollup2
INNOVATIONS PURSUED BY ONE

02:34:59.490 --> 02:35:00.791 region:rollup2
COUNTY WERE ACTUALLY

02:34:59.924 --> 02:35:02.426 region:rollup2
INFLUENCING.

02:35:00.791 --> 02:35:03.461 region:rollup2
ALL OF THE COUNTIES

02:35:02.426 --> 02:35:04.662 region:rollup2
AND THROUGH THAT WE WERE GETTING

02:35:03.461 --> 02:35:06.697 region:rollup2
BIGGER BANG FOR THE BUCK IN

02:35:04.662 --> 02:35:07.532 region:rollup2
TERMS OF THIS A HUNDRED MILLION

MILLION DOLLARS AS A

02:36:28.579 --> 02:36:31.515 region:rollup2
FOUNDATIONAL MONEY TO SET IT UP.

02:36:30.314 --> 02:36:32.783 region:rollup2
IN CONVERSATIONS WITH THE

02:36:31.515 --> 02:36:34.952 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THEY'VE ASKED US

02:36:32.783 --> 02:36:36.721 region:rollup2
TO FOCUS THAT ON REDUCING THE

02:36:34.952 --> 02:36:37.255 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF CONSUMERS WHO ARE

02:36:36.721 --> 02:36:37.755 region:rollup2
INVOLVED WITH THE CRIMINAL

02:36:37.255 --> 02:36:38.723 region:rollup2
JUSTICE SYSTEM.

02:36:37.755 --> 02:36:40.358 region:rollup2
WHICH IS ONE OF THE GOALS OF THE

02:36:38.723 --> 02:36:41.859 region:rollup2
MHSAA.

02:36:40.358 --> 02:36:43.628 region:rollup2
WE'RE THRILLED WITH THE SUPPORT

02:36:41.859 --> 02:36:45.162 region:rollup2
AND THE PROPOSAL PARTICULARLY

02:36:43.628 --> 02:36:46.530 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT WITH

02:36:45.162 --> 02:36:48.099 region:rollup2
THAT WE RELEASED LAST NOVEMBER

02:36:46.530 --> 02:36:50.067 region:rollup2
THAT HIGHLIGHTED MANY OF THE

02:36:48.099 --> 02:36:51.002 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES KEEPING FOLKS WITH

02:36:50.067 --> 02:36:52.470 region:rollup2
AND HOW NEEDS OUT OF JAIL.

02:36:51.002 --> 02:36:53.604 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:36:52.470 --> 02:36:56.007 region:rollup2
I DON'T WANT TO LOSE THE

02:36:53.604 --> 02:36:57.742 region:rollup2
QUESTION AND I AM.

02:36:56.007 --> 02:36:59.944 region:rollup2
THAT ISN'T BY THE TIME THEY'RE

02:36:57.742 --> 02:37:01.445 region:rollup2
INTERFACING WITH OUR JAIL SYSTEM

02:36:59.944 --> 02:37:03.514 region:rollup2
AREN'T WE. ALREADY LATE

02:37:01.445 --> 02:37:04.982 region:rollup2
ABSOLUTELY WOULDN'T THERE BE A

02:37:03.514 --> 02:37:06.317 region:rollup2
MORE APPROPRIATE EARLY

02:37:04.982 --> 02:37:08.452 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION AND PREVENTION

02:37:06.317 --> 02:37:09.420 region:rollup2
UPSTREAM THAN ACTUALLY RECEIVING

02:37:08.452 --> 02:37:11.555 region:rollup2
THEM IN A.

02:37:09.420 --> 02:37:12.990 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL SYSTEM ABSOLUTELY ANY

02:37:11.555 --> 02:37:15.092 region:rollup2
INTENTION IS NOT TO INNOVATE

02:37:12.990 --> 02:37:17.395 region:rollup2
AROUND HOW TO RESTORE COMPETENCY

02:37:15.092 --> 02:37:18.496 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATION IS HOW TO INVEST

02:37:17.395 --> 02:37:20.331 region:rollup2
IN WHAT WE CALL THE ZERO

02:37:18.496 --> 02:37:21.232 region:rollup2
INTERCEPT SO USING WHAT'S CALLED

02:37:20.331 --> 02:37:23.167 region:rollup2
THE SEQUENTIAL INTERSTATE MODEL

02:37:21.232 --> 02:37:24.435 region:rollup2
THE ZERO INTERCEPT MODEL. IS TO

02:37:23.167 --> 02:37:25.970 region:rollup2
PROVIDE COMMUNITY SERVICES IN

02:37:24.435 --> 02:37:27.505 region:rollup2
LIEU OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:37:25.970 --> 02:37:29.640 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT RIGHT THAT THAT THE

02:37:27.505 --> 02:37:31.409 region:rollup2
REALITIES SO YOU MAY HEAR LATER

02:37:29.640 --> 02:37:32.476 region:rollup2
ON IN THE DAY ARE AT YOUR NEXT

02:37:31.409 --> 02:37:33.477 region:rollup2
MEETING THE DEPARTMENTS THAT

02:37:32.476 --> 02:37:34.912 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS WILL TALK WITH YOU

02:37:33.477 --> 02:37:36.080 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE

02:37:34.912 --> 02:37:37.248 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO WERE DEEMED COMPETENT

02:37:36.080 --> 02:37:38.716 region:rollup2
STAND TRIAL. WE'RE NOT GETTING

02:37:37.248 --> 02:37:40.785 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SERVICES IN THE SIX

02:37:38.716 --> 02:37:41.319 region:rollup2
MONTH WINDOW PRIOR TO A FELONY

02:37:40.785 --> 02:37:42.486 region:rollup2
ARREST.

02:37:41.319 --> 02:37:43.254 region:rollup2
THESE ARE THE FOLKS WHO ARE MOST

02:37:42.486 --> 02:37:44.855 region:rollup2
SEVERELY ILL WHY AREN'T WE

02:37:43.254 --> 02:37:47.458 region:rollup2
SERVING THEM.

02:37:44.855 --> 02:37:49.226 region:rollup2
SO THE THE GOAL HERE IS TO

02:37:47.458 --> 02:37:50.861 region:rollup2
CREATE A FORUM WHERE WE CAN

02:37:49.226 --> 02:37:52.430 region:rollup2
BRING THE COUNTIES TOGETHER. TO

02:37:50.861 --> 02:37:53.698 region:rollup2
CONNECT THEM TO EACH OTHER TO

02:37:52.430 --> 02:37:55.433 region:rollup2
CONNECT THEM WITH SUBJECT MATTER

02:37:53.698 --> 02:37:57.201 region:rollup2
EXPERTS AND REALLY LEVERAGE THE

02:37:55.433 --> 02:37:58.302 region:rollup2
INNOVATION INVESTMENT IN WAYS

02:37:57.201 --> 02:38:00.071 region:rollup2
THAT ACTUALLY REDUCE THAT

02:37:58.302 --> 02:38:02.406 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL REDUCES THAT CRIMINAL

02:38:00.071 --> 02:38:04.408 region:rollup2
JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT WORTH TRYING

02:38:02.406 --> 02:38:05.409 region:rollup2
BY GOOD YEAH. JUST NO INNOVATION

02:38:04.408 --> 02:38:06.811 region:rollup2
NEEDED JUST PUT CALPERS IN THE

02:38:05.409 --> 02:38:08.312 region:rollup2
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. UP MENTAL

02:38:06.811 --> 02:38:09.146 region:rollup2
HEALTH COUNSELORS IN THEM

02:38:08.312 --> 02:38:11.349 region:rollup2
ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MIDDLE

02:38:09.146 --> 02:38:13.117 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS NOT

02:38:11.349 --> 02:38:14.952 region:rollup2
ACADEMIC COUNTERS.

02:38:13.117 --> 02:38:16.754 region:rollup2
AND I AND I AM BEING SARCASTIC

02:38:14.952 --> 02:38:18.422 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY BUT THAT THERE IS NO I

02:38:16.754 --> 02:38:19.623 region:rollup2
ONLY PARTIALLY PUT IT EXACTLY

02:38:18.422 --> 02:38:20.958 region:rollup2
PUT THEM IN THE ELEMENTARY

02:38:19.623 --> 02:38:23.094 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS MIDDLE SCHOOLS AND YOU

02:38:20.958 --> 02:38:24.662 region:rollup2
WILL MAKE SURE. I CAN GUARANTEE

02:38:23.094 --> 02:38:26.497 region:rollup2
YOU THAT THAT WOULD REDUCE

02:38:24.662 --> 02:38:28.199 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY I I WOULDN'T KNOW

02:38:26.497 --> 02:38:29.233 region:rollup2
THE NUMBERS YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

02:38:28.199 --> 02:38:30.468 region:rollup2
THE INNOVATIVE THE INNOVATORS

02:38:29.233 --> 02:38:32.336 region:rollup2
GIVE ME THOSE NUMBERS BUT I CAN

02:38:30.468 --> 02:38:34.205 region:rollup2
TELL YOU THAT IF YOU PUT. MENTAL

ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS MIDDLE

02:38:34.739 --> 02:38:37.475 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS AND HIGH SCHOOLS. BATON

02:38:36.006 --> 02:38:39.577 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD CHANGE THE I'M SORRY

02:38:37.475 --> 02:38:44.582 region:rollup2
I JUST HAVE TO INTERJECT THERE

02:38:39.577 --> 02:38:45.983 region:rollup2
THAT'S OUR PROPOSAL NUMBER SIX.

02:38:44.582 --> 02:38:47.952 region:rollup2
WELL ISSUE NUMBER SIX SUCH.

02:38:45.983 --> 02:38:49.653 region:rollup2
.

02:38:47.952 --> 02:38:51.088 region:rollup2
A I THINK THE COMMISSION AGREES

02:38:49.653 --> 02:38:52.857 region:rollup2
WITH YOU RIGHT IS THAT THAT

02:38:51.088 --> 02:38:54.392 region:rollup2
THESE FUNDS NEED TO BE USED

02:38:52.857 --> 02:38:55.526 region:rollup2
AGAIN THEIR EYES YOU KNOW

02:38:54.392 --> 02:38:56.560 region:rollup2
SOMEWHERE IN THE ORDER OF TWO

02:38:55.526 --> 02:38:57.628 region:rollup2
AND A HALF TO THREE BILLION

02:38:56.560 --> 02:38:59.130 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

02:38:57.628 --> 02:39:00.898 region:rollup2
RIGHT THAT IS NOT CONSISTENT

02:38:59.130 --> 02:39:01.565 region:rollup2
BEING USED IN WAYS THAT ARE

02:39:00.898 --> 02:39:03.868 region:rollup2
REDUCING CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:05.736 region:rollup2
INVOLVEMENT OR REDUCING SCHOOL

02:39:03.868 --> 02:39:06.704 region:rollup2
FAILURE RIDE IN AND SO THAT'S

02:39:05.736 --> 02:39:07.638 region:rollup2
THIS THIS TO WERE NOT THIS

02:39:06.704 --> 02:39:09.473 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ON TWO SEPARATE

02:39:07.638 --> 02:39:11.142 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THERE'S A NAY PARDON

02:39:09.473 --> 02:39:12.643 region:rollup2
TO BE PART THE A IS BECAUSE IT

02:39:11.142 --> 02:39:13.277 region:rollup2
IS INCLUDED IN THE. GOVERNOR'S

02:39:12.643 --> 02:39:13.444 region:rollup2
BUDGET TO BE IS NOT INCLUDED IN

02:39:13.277 --> 02:39:14.345 region:rollup2
THE

02:39:13.444 --> 02:39:16.147 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET

02:39:14.345 --> 02:39:17.648 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO

02:39:16.147 --> 02:39:18.816 region:rollup2
DO IS GET A PATH TO SUCCESS FOR

02:39:17.648 --> 02:39:20.317 region:rollup2
INNOVATION IN CALIFORNIA BY

02:39:18.816 --> 02:39:22.486 region:rollup2
CREATING A VENUE AND WE'VE

02:39:20.317 --> 02:39:23.120 region:rollup2
DESIGNED THIS THAT THE STATE

02:39:22.486 --> 02:39:24.822 region:rollup2
LEVEL ADMINISTRATIVE FUNDS AND

02:39:23.120 --> 02:39:26.891 region:rollup2
TO SAY STATE FUNDS. WOULD

02:39:24.822 --> 02:39:28.759 region:rollup2
BASICALLY SEED AND LAUNCH THIS

02:39:26.891 --> 02:39:30.027 region:rollup2
THIS ENTITY WE WERE CONTRACTED

02:39:28.759 --> 02:39:31.228 region:rollup2
OUT TO A NONPROFIT BECAUSE

02:39:30.027 --> 02:39:32.496 region:rollup2
THEY'RE SMARTER PEOPLE IN THE

02:39:31.228 --> 02:39:33.297 region:rollup2
WORLD AND WE ARE NOT OF HOW TO

02:39:32.496 --> 02:39:34.965 region:rollup2
DO IT.

02:39:33.297 --> 02:39:36.067 region:rollup2
AND THE IDEA IS THAT WE WILL

02:39:34.965 --> 02:39:37.501 region:rollup2
INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO BE OF

02:39:36.067 --> 02:39:39.236 region:rollup2
THE USE THEIR EXISTING FUNDS TO

02:39:37.501 --> 02:39:41.272 region:rollup2
PAY FOR THAT SEWER SERVICE ON AN

02:39:39.236 --> 02:39:43.007 region:rollup2
ONGOING BASIS IT'S A MARKET TEST

02:39:41.272 --> 02:39:44.041 region:rollup2
IN THE IDEAS OF WEAKENED SUPPORT

02:39:43.007 --> 02:39:46.110 region:rollup2
THEIR ABILITY. TO WORK

02:39:44.041 --> 02:39:47.611 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVELY GIVEN THE

02:39:46.110 --> 02:39:49.013 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HIGHLIGHT

02:39:47.611 --> 02:39:50.548 region:rollup2
THE EVALUATION AND DO THAT THE

02:39:49.013 --> 02:39:53.217 region:rollup2
LEARNING THAT COMES OUT OF THAT

02:39:50.548 --> 02:39:53.751 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE THEN THEY CAN YOU KNOW

02:39:53.217 --> 02:39:55.553 region:rollup2
USE OUR INNOVATION DOLLARS

02:39:53.751 --> 02:39:56.921 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY. NO PAY FOR THE

02:39:55.553 --> 02:39:58.122 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT THEY'RE DESIGNING

02:39:56.921 --> 02:39:59.056 region:rollup2
BUT THE INCUBATOR DOES IS HELP

02:39:58.122 --> 02:40:00.624 region:rollup2
THEM DESIGN THEM IN A

02:39:59.056 --> 02:40:01.926 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE STRATEGY AND OVER

02:40:00.624 --> 02:40:03.427 region:rollup2
TIME THEY WOULD USE THEIR

02:40:01.926 --> 02:40:05.429 region:rollup2
FUNDING TO PAY FOR THAT SERVICE

02:40:03.427 --> 02:40:07.531 region:rollup2
ONCE THE INITIAL STATES INITIAL

02:40:05.429 --> 02:40:08.833 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT IS GONE.

02:40:07.531 --> 02:40:10.034 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ILIO ANY

02:40:08.833 --> 02:40:12.369 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ON ISSUE FIVE.

02:40:10.034 --> 02:40:14.672 region:rollup2
WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE

02:40:12.369 --> 02:40:16.240 region:rollup2
OASES PROPOSAL FOR INCOMPETENT

SO THEN.

02:57:30.807 --> 02:57:34.010 region:rollup2
SECONDLY DON'T TALK A LITTLE

02:57:32.709 --> 02:57:34.177 region:rollup2

THROUGHOUT THE PROGRAM THERE'S

02:57:37.480 --> 02:57:41.584 region:rollup2
BEEN A A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES

02:57:39.015 --> 02:57:42.685 region:rollup2

.

02:57:45.822 --> 02:57:47.891 region:rollup2
I WOULD START WITH PROBABLY THE

THE INTER DEPARTMENTAL.

02:58:16.619 --> 02:58:19.322 region:rollup2
LEVELS AT THE COUNTY THAT WE'VE

02:58:18.221 --> 02:58:20.790 region:rollup2
HAD WORKED. AND HAVE PARTNERED

02:58:19.322 --> 02:58:22.025 region:rollup2
WITH COUNTIES.

02:58:20.790 --> 02:58:24.427 region:rollup2
YOU SEE THAT SUCCESSFUL.

02:58:22.025 --> 02:58:25.795 region:rollup2
ARM.

02:58:24.427 --> 02:58:27.697 region:rollup2
FOR THOSE COUNTIES THAT WERE NOT

02:58:25.795 --> 02:58:29.065 region:rollup2
PURCHASING PROPERTY ON COUNTY

02:58:27.697 --> 02:58:30.733 region:rollup2
OWNED LAND.

02:58:29.065 --> 02:58:32.669 region:rollup2
OF SOME OF THEM HAVE EXPERIENCE

02:58:30.733 --> 02:58:33.169 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES IN TRYING TO ACTUALLY

02:58:32.669 --> 02:58:35.104 region:rollup2
FIND PROPER THAT TICKET

02:58:33.169 --> 02:58:36.272 region:rollup2
PURCHASE.

02:58:35.104 --> 02:58:37.840 region:rollup2
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH THE COUNTY

02:58:36.272 --> 02:58:38.441 region:rollup2
THEMSELVES IN THE REAL ESTATE

02:58:37.840 --> 02:58:39.709 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OR EVEN THREW AWAY

02:58:38.441 --> 02:58:41.711 region:rollup2
ON.

02:58:39.709 --> 02:58:43.279 region:rollup2
A OUR SERVICE PROVIDER.

02:58:41.711 --> 02:58:44.614 region:rollup2
MANY THE COUNTIES USE A SERVICE

02:58:43.279 --> 02:58:46.182 region:rollup2
PROVIDER TO DELIVER THE SERVICES

02:58:44.614 --> 02:58:47.283 region:rollup2
AND THAT SERVICE PROVIDER WILL

02:58:46.182 --> 02:58:48.751 region:rollup2
ALSO.

02:58:47.283 --> 02:58:50.587 region:rollup2
PURCHASE A PROPERTY TO BE USED

02:58:48.751 --> 02:58:52.889 region:rollup2
FOR A TWENTY THIRTY APPEAR FOR

02:58:50.587 --> 02:58:54.057 region:rollup2
THE LIFE OF THE PROJECT.

02:58:52.889 --> 02:58:55.592 region:rollup2
SO THEY HAVE IN SOME AREAS

02:58:54.057 --> 02:58:57.093 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DELAY

02:58:55.592 --> 02:58:58.161 region:rollup2
AND AND TRYING TO FIND A

02:58:57.093 --> 02:58:59.195 region:rollup2
PROPERLY CAN PURCHASE IN A

02:58:58.161 --> 02:59:01.598 region:rollup2
TIMELY MANNER.

02:58:59.195 --> 02:59:02.899 region:rollup2
ARM.

02:59:01.598 --> 02:59:03.399 region:rollup2
AND JUST TWO OTHER THINGS I

02:59:02.899 --> 02:59:06.736 region:rollup2
THINK I WOULD MENTION.

02:59:03.399 --> 02:59:08.137 region:rollup2
IN IN SOME CASES THERE HAS BEEN

02:59:06.736 --> 02:59:08.538 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH I'M

02:59:08.137 --> 02:59:10.773 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH.

02:59:08.538 --> 02:59:12.041 region:rollup2
.

02:59:10.773 --> 02:59:13.276 region:rollup2
CITIES AND COUNTIES OF IS BITS

02:59:12.041 --> 02:59:14.510 region:rollup2
OF LOCAL OPPOSITION IN THAT IN

02:59:13.276 --> 02:59:15.745 region:rollup2
SOME INSTANCES.

02:59:14.510 --> 02:59:18.648 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS DELAY THE PROCESS

02:59:15.745 --> 02:59:20.216 region:rollup2
FOR A NUMBER OF COUNTIES.

02:59:18.648 --> 02:59:21.384 region:rollup2
AND AT LAST ABLE MITCH IN THAT.

02:59:20.216 --> 02:59:22.252 region:rollup2
.

02:59:21.384 --> 02:59:24.020 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF SOME OF THE TURN OVER

02:59:22.252 --> 02:59:24.821 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE EXPERIENCED.

02:59:24.020 --> 02:59:25.121 region:rollup2
I WITH THE COUNTY LEVEL

02:59:24.821 --> 02:59:26.289 region:rollup2
EXECUTIVES.

02:59:25.121 --> 02:59:28.157 region:rollup2
.

02:59:26.289 --> 02:59:29.325 region:rollup2
OFTEN THEY WILL.

02:59:28.157 --> 02:59:31.894 region:rollup2
HAVE TURNOVER ENABLE.

02:59:29.325 --> 02:59:33.663 region:rollup2
EITHER PUT THIS PROGRAM OR

02:59:31.894 --> 02:59:35.031 region:rollup2
PROJECT ON THE BACK BURNER.

02:59:33.663 --> 02:59:36.432 region:rollup2
OR CHANGE THE PARAMETERS OF A

02:59:35.031 --> 02:59:38.668 region:rollup2
PROGRAM THAT HAS BEEN AWARDED

02:59:36.432 --> 02:59:40.169 region:rollup2
ALREADY SO.

02:59:38.668 --> 02:59:41.437 region:rollup2
AND THAT HAS CAUSED SOME DELAYS

02:59:40.169 --> 02:59:42.438 region:rollup2
IN IN AND.

02:59:41.437 --> 02:59:43.339 region:rollup2
SOME CASES A COMPLETE CHANGE OF

02:59:42.438 --> 02:59:45.274 region:rollup2
THE PROJECT.

02:59:43.339 --> 02:59:46.142 region:rollup2
SECULAR.

02:59:45.274 --> 02:59:48.044 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE HAD WORKED THROUGH

02:59:46.142 --> 02:59:48.778 region:rollup2
THOSE AND AND MANY OTHER

02:59:48.044 --> 02:59:50.847 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES.

02:59:48.778 --> 02:59:52.382 region:rollup2
AS WE'VE PROGRESSED OF THIS

02:59:50.847 --> 02:59:53.683 region:rollup2
PROGRAM RIGHT NOW.

02:59:52.382 --> 02:59:55.485 region:rollup2
STAFF IS HAS DONE A A

02:59:53.683 --> 02:59:56.386 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT JOB AND MAINTAIN A

02:59:55.485 --> 02:59:57.820 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP FOR THE COUNTIES ON

02:59:56.386 --> 02:59:59.922 region:rollup2
AN ONGOING BASIS.

02:59:57.820 --> 03:00:02.458 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO ALLEVIATE AND OVERCOME

02:59:59.922 --> 03:00:06.763 region:rollup2
EACH OF THESE CHALLENGES.

03:00:02.458 --> 03:00:08.665 region:rollup2
W..

03:00:06.763 --> 03:00:09.932 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THE NIGHT

03:00:08.665 --> 03:00:10.967 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT SO WELL CHAFF A

03:00:09.932 --> 03:00:12.969 region:rollup2
PROVIDES FUNDING FOR THAT MUCH

03:00:10.967 --> 03:00:14.871 region:rollup2
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE

03:00:12.969 --> 03:00:15.438 region:rollup2
FUNDS AT THE COMMISSION RECEIVES

03:00:14.871 --> 03:00:16.072 region:rollup2
ARE REALLY DEDICATED TOWARDS

03:00:15.438 --> 03:00:17.640 region:rollup2
PERSONNEL.

03:00:16.072 --> 03:00:18.841 region:rollup2
AND WE ISSUE WE PROVIDED A

03:00:17.640 --> 03:00:20.643 region:rollup2
REPORT TO YOU BEGINNING OF THE

03:00:18.841 --> 03:00:22.679 region:rollup2
YEAR OUTLINING THE OPPORTUNITIES

03:00:20.643 --> 03:00:24.647 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO SOME OF THE CHALLENGES.

03:00:22.679 --> 03:00:25.381 region:rollup2
I THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT

03:00:24.647 --> 03:00:27.684 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AT THE COMMISSION

03:00:25.381 --> 03:00:28.918 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOES ALLOW US TO

03:00:27.684 --> 03:00:30.720 region:rollup2
CREATE SOME INCENTIVES

03:00:28.918 --> 03:00:32.488 region:rollup2
FOR COUNTIES TO DO THINGS THAT

03:00:30.720 --> 03:00:34.290 region:rollup2
ARE NOT OTHERWISE DOING.

03:00:32.488 --> 03:00:35.725 region:rollup2
AND I'M MORE AWARE CHALLENGED BY

03:00:34.290 --> 03:00:36.793 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE COUNTIES WILL ALSO

03:00:35.725 --> 03:00:38.361 region:rollup2
SAY THESE CAN BE THE MOST

03:00:36.793 --> 03:00:38.928 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FUNDS THEY HAVE.

03:00:38.361 --> 03:00:40.930 region:rollup2
AND YET WHEN THE FUNDS RIGHT

03:00:38.928 --> 03:00:42.665 region:rollup2
NOW.

03:00:40.930 --> 03:00:43.633 region:rollup2
AND YOU KNOW WE SEE FUNDS IN

03:00:42.665 --> 03:00:44.767 region:rollup2
THEIR ACCOUNTS AND AND THERE'S

03:00:43.633 --> 03:00:47.170 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS ARE ON THE

03:00:44.767 --> 03:00:47.770 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY OF THE PROGRAM.

03:00:47.170 --> 03:00:49.072 region:rollup2
AND WE SORT OF QUESTION THAT

03:00:47.770 --> 03:00:51.174 region:rollup2
RIGHT THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT

03:00:49.072 --> 03:00:51.808 region:rollup2
THING THAT YOU CAN INVEST IN

03:00:51.174 --> 03:00:52.375 region:rollup2
MARCH INVESTING YOUR DOLLARS AND

03:00:51.808 --> 03:00:53.743 region:rollup2
THREE.

03:00:52.375 --> 03:00:55.511 region:rollup2
BUT EVEN RECOGNIZING THAT THIS

03:00:53.743 --> 03:00:57.547 region:rollup2
IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT TOOL THAT

03:00:55.511 --> 03:00:59.082 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS TO SHAPE HOW

03:00:57.547 --> 03:01:00.583 region:rollup2
COUNTIES INVEST IN THESE KINDS

03:00:59.082 --> 03:01:04.287 region:rollup2
OF PROGRAMS.

03:01:00.583 --> 03:01:04.887 region:rollup2
THE COMMISSION IS A WELL AS THE

03:01:04.287 --> 03:01:05.755 region:rollup2
COUNTY TO RECEIVE THESE FUNDS

03:01:04.887 --> 03:01:07.957 region:rollup2
THROUGH OUR FIRST ROUND THE

03:01:05.755 --> 03:01:09.692 region:rollup2
REALLY WRAPPING UP THAT PROGRAM

03:01:07.957 --> 03:01:11.427 region:rollup2
AND YOU'LL HEAR THE NEXT ITEM OF

03:01:09.692 --> 03:01:12.161 region:rollup2
REPORT OUT ON THAT AND THERE ARE

03:01:11.427 --> 03:01:13.963 region:rollup2
SOME UNSPENT FUNDS.

03:01:12.161 --> 03:01:15.498 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN SOME REALLY

03:01:13.963 --> 03:01:17.066 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THINGS HAPPEN WITH HIS

03:01:15.498 --> 03:01:18.468 region:rollup2
DOLLARS WE'VE SEEN LAW

03:01:17.066 --> 03:01:20.203 region:rollup2
ENFORCEMENT AND COUNTY MENTAL

03:01:18.468 --> 03:01:21.704 region:rollup2
HEALTH GET.

03:01:20.203 --> 03:01:22.805 region:rollup2
CREATE MUCH STRONGER TEAMS

03:01:21.704 --> 03:01:24.941 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE FUNDS HAVE BEEN

03:01:22.805 --> 03:01:27.076 region:rollup2
USED TO PUT PEOPLE IN PATROL

03:01:24.941 --> 03:01:29.412 region:rollup2
CARS OR IT WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

03:01:27.076 --> 03:01:30.613 region:rollup2
WHO CAN WORK WITH FAMILIES AFTER

03:01:29.412 --> 03:01:32.148 region:rollup2
THE LAW ENFORCEMENT LEAVES WHAT

03:01:30.613 --> 03:01:34.150 region:rollup2
THESE OR OR THERE ARE OUTREACH

03:01:32.148 --> 03:01:36.018 region:rollup2
STRATEGIES HAPPENING IN HOMELESS

03:01:34.150 --> 03:01:37.487 region:rollup2
CAMPS BETWEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT.

03:01:36.018 --> 03:01:39.489 region:rollup2
OR EAT OR.

03:01:37.487 --> 03:01:40.690 region:rollup2
PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH NURSES WHO

03:01:39.489 --> 03:01:42.759 region:rollup2
ARE YOU KNOW HIRED WITH THESE

03:01:40.690 --> 03:01:43.960 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SO THIS IS A REALLY

03:01:42.759 --> 03:01:45.495 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TOOL. WE'VE ALSO SEEN

03:01:43.960 --> 03:01:47.397 region:rollup2
SOME CHALLENGES MANY OF THE

03:01:45.495 --> 03:01:50.266 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES ARE CONSISTENT WITH

03:01:47.397 --> 03:01:52.468 region:rollup2
MY COLLEAGUES ON THAT ON THE

03:01:50.266 --> 03:01:55.004 region:rollup2
FIFTH ON THE FACILITY SIDE. THAT

03:01:52.468 --> 03:01:55.571 region:rollup2
IT HAS TAKEN A SOMETIME FOR

03:01:55.004 --> 03:01:56.305 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO FIGURE OUT THESE

03:01:55.571 --> 03:01:57.006 region:rollup2
PARTNERSHIPS.

03:01:56.305 --> 03:01:58.341 region:rollup2
WE ARE DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS

03:01:57.006 --> 03:01:59.208 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS THIS MOVING FORWARD

03:01:58.341 --> 03:02:00.343 region:rollup2
WHERE START WE'RE ACTUALLY

03:01:59.208 --> 03:02:02.879 region:rollup2
ENACTED PROCUREMENT NOW FOR

03:02:00.343 --> 03:02:04.380 region:rollup2
SECOND ROUND OF TRIAGE GRANTS.

03:02:02.879 --> 03:02:05.882 region:rollup2
THAT RECOGNIZING THAT ABOUT

03:02:04.380 --> 03:02:07.683 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE FUNDS

03:02:05.882 --> 03:02:09.085 region:rollup2
THAT WERE FIRST ALLOCATED THEIR

03:02:07.683 --> 03:02:09.986 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED IN A COMPETITIVE

03:02:09.085 --> 03:02:10.787 region:rollup2
PROCESS FOR THE COUNTIES

03:02:09.986 --> 03:02:12.588 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED THEIR GREATEST

03:02:10.787 --> 03:02:13.256 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES BUT EIGHTY FIVE

03:02:12.588 --> 03:02:14.524 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THAT WENT TOWARD THE

03:02:13.256 --> 03:02:16.359 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS THAT WERE REALLY

03:02:14.524 --> 03:02:18.027 region:rollup2
TARGETING ADULTS. ONLY ABOUT

03:02:16.359 --> 03:02:19.395 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN SEVENTEEN PERCENT

03:02:18.027 --> 03:02:20.463 region:rollup2
TARGETING CHILDREN.

03:02:19.395 --> 03:02:22.265 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THAT IN THE SECOND

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.069 region:rollup2
THAT AT LEAST HALF THE FUNDS

MUST GO TOWARDS KIDS.

03:02:27.069 --> 03:02:29.672 region:rollup2

MULTIPLE ENTITIES.

03:02:56.732 --> 03:03:00.269 region:rollup2
THE AUDIT POINTED OUT THAT WE

03:02:59.001 --> 03:03:01.270 region:rollup2
DID NOT DO A STATE LEVEL

03:03:00.269 --> 03:03:03.873 region:rollup2
EVALUATION DURING THE FIRST

03:03:01.270 --> 03:03:05.041 region:rollup2
ROUND WE'D WE WE DID REQUIRE THE

03:03:03.873 --> 03:03:06.442 region:rollup2
COUNTIES DO AN EVALUATION OF

03:03:05.041 --> 03:03:08.478 region:rollup2
THEIR PROGRAM AND WE DESIGNED

03:03:06.442 --> 03:03:10.246 region:rollup2
THAT SPECIFICALLY. TO ENCOURAGE

03:03:08.478 --> 03:03:11.814 region:rollup2
THEM TO EVALUATE THEIR PROGRAM

03:03:10.246 --> 03:03:14.317 region:rollup2
AROUND THEIR NEEDS BECAUSE WE

03:03:11.814 --> 03:03:15.551 region:rollup2
WANTED IT. TO BE SUSTAINED WITH

03:03:14.317 --> 03:03:16.552 region:rollup2
THEIR LOCAL DOLLARS

03:03:15.551 --> 03:03:17.520 region:rollup2
AND SO THE EVALUATIONS REALLY

03:03:16.552 --> 03:03:18.754 region:rollup2
WERE DESIGNED TO MEET THEIR

03:03:17.520 --> 03:03:20.790 region:rollup2
INFORMATION NEEDS

03:03:18.754 --> 03:03:22.058 region:rollup2
THE DOWNSIDE OF THAT. IS THAT

03:03:20.790 --> 03:03:24.093 region:rollup2
IT'S VERY HARD TO TELL STATEWIDE

03:03:22.058 --> 03:03:25.661 region:rollup2

MILLION?

03:06:01.584 --> 03:06:05.321 region:rollup2
WHAT IF WE LOOK AT COMMUNITY

HOW IT IS THAT YOUR BALANCES

03:06:23.105 --> 03:06:26.442 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVEN MILLION IF.

03:06:24.674 --> 03:06:28.277 region:rollup2

03:06:26.442 --> 03:06:30.079 region:rollup2
IN OUR GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATED

03:06:28.277 --> 03:06:31.313 region:rollup2
MORE FUNDS THAN THAT.

03:06:30.079 --> 03:06:32.815 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ME I'M CLEAR I WAS

03:06:31.313 --> 03:06:34.383 region:rollup2
REFERRING TO JUST TO CHILDREN

03:06:32.815 --> 03:06:36.919 region:rollup2

GOTTEN TO THE IT INFRASTRUCTURE

03:06:36.919 --> 03:06:39.055 region:rollup2
PIZZA PARA.

03:06:37.653 --> 03:06:40.122 region:rollup2
SO.

03:06:39.055 --> 03:06:42.858 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN YOU PIECE IS REALLY

03:06:40.122 --> 03:06:44.427 region:rollup2
COMPOSED OF TWO PARTS OF ELEVEN

03:06:42.858 --> 03:06:46.062 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLAR POT AND ALSO A

03:06:44.427 --> 03:06:47.163 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLAR PART.

03:06:46.062 --> 03:06:48.264 region:rollup2
BOTH OF WHICH ARE GOING TO BE

03:06:47.163 --> 03:06:49.865 region:rollup2
USED FOR CHILDREN AND YOUTH AND

03:06:48.264 --> 03:06:51.300 region:rollup2
THAT'S THAT'S A PIECE THAT WE'RE

03:06:49.865 --> 03:06:52.902 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY WORKING ON DEVELOPING.

03:06:51.300 --> 03:06:55.071 region:rollup2
REGULATIONS FOR.

03:06:52.902 --> 03:06:55.938 region:rollup2
BUT ONE OF THE THE CHALLENGES

03:06:55.071 --> 03:06:57.139 region:rollup2
WERE HAVING AND WE'RE WORKING

03:06:55.938 --> 03:06:58.774 region:rollup2
THROUGH THAT DEPARTMENT OF

03:06:57.139 --> 03:06:59.642 region:rollup2
FINANCE IS TRYING TO.

03:06:58.774 --> 03:07:02.344 region:rollup2
BOB ALLYING.

03:06:59.642 --> 03:07:04.313 region:rollup2
.

03:07:02.344 --> 03:07:06.849 region:rollup2
FUNDING STREAMS AND WHICH.

03:07:04.313 --> 03:07:08.317 region:rollup2
MONIES HAVE TO BE SPENT.

03:07:06.849 --> 03:07:10.920 region:rollup2
AND ALSO ENCUMBERED SO BAD. ON

03:07:08.317 --> 03:07:13.055 region:rollup2
IF WE'RE OVER SUBSCRIBED IN.

03:07:10.920 --> 03:07:14.123 region:rollup2
ONE AREA AND UNDER SUBSCRIBE TO

03:07:13.055 --> 03:07:15.324 region:rollup2
ANOTHER AREA SO FOR INSTANCE IF

03:07:14.123 --> 03:07:16.492 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

03:07:15.324 --> 03:07:19.028 region:rollup2
A LACK OF RESPONSE.

03:07:16.492 --> 03:07:21.097 region:rollup2
IN.

03:07:19.028 --> 03:07:22.064 region:rollup2
MOBILE CRISIS SUPPORT TEAMS.

03:07:21.097 --> 03:07:23.699 region:rollup2
AND AND MORE THAN ENOUGH

03:07:22.064 --> 03:07:25.267 region:rollup2
RESPONSE IN FAMILY RESPITE CARE

03:07:23.699 --> 03:07:26.335 region:rollup2
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE ABILITY TO

03:07:25.267 --> 03:07:27.603 region:rollup2
MOVE THOSE FUNDS FROM ONE POT TO

03:07:26.335 --> 03:07:29.338 region:rollup2
THE NEXT.

03:07:27.603 --> 03:07:31.040 region:rollup2
BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TWENTY

03:07:29.338 --> 03:07:33.409 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN FUNDS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN

03:07:31.040 --> 03:07:35.711 region:rollup2
SPENT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

03:07:33.409 --> 03:07:37.747 region:rollup2
SO HOW OF WE APPROPRIATELY

03:07:35.711 --> 03:07:38.380 region:rollup2
INSURED THAT THE MONEY IS

03:07:37.747 --> 03:07:40.783 region:rollup2
GETTING OUT THE DOOR TO DEAL

03:07:38.380 --> 03:07:43.919 region:rollup2
WITH THE. CRISES THAT WE HAVE

03:07:40.783 --> 03:07:44.754 region:rollup2
GOING ON EACH AND EVERY DAY.

03:07:43.919 --> 03:07:46.322 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THESE HAVE NOT BEEN.

03:07:44.754 --> 03:07:48.257 region:rollup2

03:07:46.322 --> 03:07:49.692 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T HAVE REGULATIONS FOR.

03:07:48.257 --> 03:07:51.660 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVEN MINUTES

03:07:49.692 --> 03:07:52.828 region:rollup2
ALSO SO.

03:07:51.660 --> 03:07:54.163 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THE TWENTY SIXTEEN

03:07:52.828 --> 03:07:54.764 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN ARE PRETTY

03:07:54.163 --> 03:07:55.764 region:rollup2
PRESCRIPTIVE IN TERMS OF THEIR

03:07:55.764 --> 03:07:58.400 region:rollup2
SO FOR INSTANCE IN TWENTY

03:07:57.099 --> 03:08:00.202 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN.

03:07:58.400 --> 03:08:01.771 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN AMOUNT.

03:08:00.202 --> 03:08:03.205 region:rollup2
THAT CAN BE YOU SPECIFICALLY FOR

03:08:01.771 --> 03:08:04.773 region:rollup2
MOBILE CRISIS AND FAMILY RESPITE

03:08:03.205 --> 03:08:05.741 region:rollup2
CARE BUT.

03:08:04.773 --> 03:08:07.676 region:rollup2
IT CANNOT BE USED IN ANY OF THE

03:08:05.741 --> 03:08:08.911 region:rollup2
OTHER PROGRAMS.

03:08:07.676 --> 03:08:10.045 region:rollup2
AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT DEMAND

03:08:08.911 --> 03:08:12.148 region:rollup2
FOR INSTANCE

03:08:10.045 --> 03:08:13.516 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE.

03:08:12.148 --> 03:08:14.884 region:rollup2
FAR LAST IN THE MOBILE CRISIS

03:08:13.516 --> 03:08:16.385 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TEAM.

03:08:14.884 --> 03:08:17.620 region:rollup2
AS AN EXAMPLE SO WE HAVE SEVEN

03:08:16.385 --> 03:08:19.755 region:rollup2
POINT EIGHT MILLION ABOUT

03:08:17.620 --> 03:08:20.790 region:rollup2
AVAILABLE TO US.

03:08:19.755 --> 03:08:22.358 region:rollup2
TO MAKE GRANTS FOR MOBILE CRISIS

03:08:20.790 --> 03:08:24.126 region:rollup2
SUPPORT TEAMS.

03:08:22.358 --> 03:08:26.128 region:rollup2
WHERE?

03:08:24.126 --> 03:08:28.330 region:rollup2
CONFIDENT THAT THAT WILL BE

03:08:26.128 --> 03:08:30.332 region:rollup2
SEVERELY UNDER SUBSCRIBED.

03:08:28.330 --> 03:08:32.935 region:rollup2
AS A COMPARISON.

03:08:30.332 --> 03:08:34.069 region:rollup2
IN THE A REGULAR SB EIGHTY TWO

03:08:32.935 --> 03:08:36.605 region:rollup2

03:08:36.605 --> 03:08:39.141 region:rollup2
FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS.

03:08:38.240 --> 03:08:41.076 region:rollup2
WE HAD ABOUT FOUR MILLION

03:08:39.141 --> 03:08:43.412 region:rollup2
DOLLARS.

03:08:41.076 --> 03:08:44.680 region:rollup2
POWER THAT WAS USED FOR MOBILE

03:08:43.412 --> 03:08:45.915 region:rollup2
CRISIS SUPPORT TEAM SO WE KNOW.

03:08:44.680 --> 03:08:47.616 region:rollup2
THAT AMOUNT IS GOING TO BE UNDER

03:08:45.915 --> 03:08:49.051 region:rollup2
SUBSCRIBED.

03:08:47.616 --> 03:08:50.719 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'D LIKE TO DO IS TO BILL

03:08:49.051 --> 03:08:53.422 region:rollup2
TO MOVE IT AND MAKE IT AVAILABLE

03:08:50.719 --> 03:08:56.258 region:rollup2
TO ONE OF THE OTHER PROGRAMS?

03:08:53.422 --> 03:08:58.027 region:rollup2
SO THAT MONEY ISN'T LOST.

03:08:56.258 --> 03:09:00.462 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH OF THOSE FUNDS HAVE

03:08:58.027 --> 03:09:02.498 region:rollup2
BEEN SPENT SO FAR THAT WERE

03:09:00.462 --> 03:09:03.699 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATED IN TWENTY SIXTEEN?

03:09:02.498 --> 03:09:05.534 region:rollup2
BUT NONE OF THE FUNDS HAVE BEEN

03:09:03.699 --> 03:09:07.937 region:rollup2
SPENT SO FAR THEY'VE NOT ISN'T

03:09:05.534 --> 03:09:10.072 region:rollup2
THERE A PROBLEM WITH THAT.

03:09:07.937 --> 03:09:12.541 region:rollup2
IF THEY WERE APPROPRIATED FOR A

03:09:10.072 --> 03:09:14.143 region:rollup2
CRISIS CENTER. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

03:09:12.541 --> 03:09:18.814 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE NOT ESTABLISHED A

03:09:14.143 --> 03:09:20.883 region:rollup2
CRISIS CENTER. BY TWENTY EIGHT.

03:09:18.814 --> 03:09:22.618 region:rollup2
WHEN CAN WE EXPECT REGULATIONS

03:09:20.883 --> 03:09:24.520 region:rollup2
TO BE BEFORE US SO THAT THE

03:09:22.618 --> 03:09:26.755 region:rollup2
FUNDS WE APPROPRIATED TWO YEARS

03:09:24.520 --> 03:09:30.059 region:rollup2
AGO. ARE BEING EFFECTIVE FOR

03:09:26.755 --> 03:09:30.759 region:rollup2
THEIR DOESN'T PURPOSE.

03:09:30.059 --> 03:09:33.395 region:rollup2
ARE.

03:09:30.759 --> 03:09:34.530 region:rollup2
SO.

03:09:33.395 --> 03:09:35.097 region:rollup2
A PART OF THE CHALLENGE OF WHAT

03:09:34.530 --> 03:09:36.599 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WAS

03:09:35.097 --> 03:09:37.233 region:rollup2
WORK.

THAT WE CAN DO WHAT CAN WE DO TO

03:09:45.674 --> 03:09:48.844 region:rollup2
HELP TO ENSURE THAT THIS MONEY

03:09:47.109 --> 03:09:50.479 region:rollup2
IS.

03:09:48.844 --> 03:09:51.447 region:rollup2

HOW THE COLOR OF THE MONEY HAVE

03:09:54.984 --> 03:09:58.153 region:rollup2
CHANGED SO IN TWENTY SIXTEEN

03:09:57.286 --> 03:10:00.356 region:rollup2

HAVE THE GENERAL FUND THEM THERE

03:10:14.770 --> 03:10:18.974 region:rollup2
TO FUND THIS INVESTMENT SO. WE

03:10:17.573 --> 03:10:20.209 region:rollup2
WE HAD TO LIKE TAKE BACK THE

03:10:18.974 --> 03:10:21.744 region:rollup2
GENERAL FUND BUT WE REPLACE IT

03:10:20.209 --> 03:10:22.077 region:rollup2
WITH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

INCUMBENTS UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY

03:10:36.425 --> 03:10:39.728 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT GOES INTO THE.

03:10:37.993 --> 03:10:40.763 region:rollup2
THE CHALLENGE THAT THE OUR

03:10:39.728 --> 03:10:44.133 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES FROM THE AUTHORITIES

03:10:40.763 --> 03:10:44.700 region:rollup2

THOSE WERE THE DIVISION OF.

03:11:11.160 --> 03:11:15.097 region:rollup2
THOSE AMOUNTS WERE SCHEDULE

03:11:13.796 --> 03:11:16.065 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE GOALS THAT WERE SET

03:11:15.097 --> 03:11:18.033 region:rollup2
AT THE TIME THAT WE WERE

03:11:16.065 --> 03:11:20.703 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING THE FUNDING FOR S. B.

03:11:18.033 --> 03:11:22.271 region:rollup2
THREE THREE SO. EVEN THOUGH.

03:11:20.703 --> 03:11:24.373 region:rollup2
SO THIS ONE THING THAT WERE

03:11:22.271 --> 03:11:25.607 region:rollup2
INCOMPLETE IN CONTINUE

03:11:24.373 --> 03:11:26.475 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION WITH THE AUTHORITY

03:11:25.607 --> 03:11:30.112 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO BE ABLE TO BE

STATUTE MIGHT WAS PASSED IT'S SO

03:11:42.691 --> 03:11:48.430 region:rollup2
HARD TO BE RESPONSIVE TO THE

03:11:47.830 --> 03:11:49.131 region:rollup2
NEEDS OF KNOW MONEY'S GONE OUT

03:11:48.430 --> 03:11:49.665 region:rollup2

03:11:49.131 --> 03:11:51.166 region:rollup2
I MEAN I'M NOT TRYING TO

03:11:49.665 --> 03:11:52.901 region:rollup2
CONTINUE A POINT AND I HOPE.

03:11:51.166 --> 03:11:53.502 region:rollup2
TO LEAVE IT THERE I JUST AM

03:11:52.901 --> 03:11:54.136 region:rollup2

GOING ON EACH AND EVERY DAY.

03:11:56.872 --> 03:11:58.107 region:rollup2
AND WITH THAT I HOPE WE CAN TURN

03:11:57.573 --> 03:11:58.974 region:rollup2
THE DISCUSSION NOW TO THE

03:11:58.107 --> 03:12:00.542 region:rollup2

STAKEHOLDER A GROUP THAT WE CAN

03:12:15.891 --> 03:12:18.127 region:rollup2

GROUPS THAT WE COULD WORK WITH

03:12:27.736 --> 03:12:30.839 region:rollup2
AND THAT CAN HELP US TO DEVELOP

03:12:29.238 --> 03:12:33.008 region:rollup2
AND BUILD A PROGRAM.

03:12:30.839 --> 03:12:34.143 region:rollup2
I IN PART BASED ON USING SOME OF

03:12:33.008 --> 03:12:35.144 region:rollup2
THE EXPERIENCES WE'VE LEARNED

HELPED US BEGIN TO.

03:12:52.461 --> 03:12:55.731 region:rollup2

WOULD TAKE TO GET INPUT AND

03:13:13.415 --> 03:13:16.485 region:rollup2
AGAINST TO HAVE FUNDS GO OUT.

03:13:14.750 --> 03:13:18.554 region:rollup2
WOULD IT BE REASONABLE TO EXPECT

THE AMOUNT THAT WAS VERY

03:19:55.317 --> 03:19:58.653 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE.

THERE THIRTY MILLION IS AN

03:20:13.301 --> 03:20:16.238 region:rollup2
ESTIMATE OF WHAT WE EXPECT.

03:20:23.879 --> 03:20:28.250 region:rollup2

ARE DIRECTORS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

03:26:54.402 --> 03:26:58.306 region:rollup2
THEY DO AND A RECURRING THEME IS

03:26:56.638 --> 03:26:59.040 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY WITHOUT THE MENTAL

ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE THEY

03:27:10.084 --> 03:27:13.655 region:rollup2
A SOURCE OF FUNDING. UNLIKE ANY

03:27:11.719 --> 03:27:14.622 region:rollup2

STATED THAT NOT ONLY IS IT

03:27:37.679 --> 03:27:38.880 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT FOR INCREASING THE

03:27:38.279 --> 03:27:39.514 region:rollup2
NUMBERS OF FOLKS WHO ARE IN

03:27:38.880 --> 03:27:40.114 region:rollup2

THE FUTURE.

03:28:04.138 --> 03:28:06.607 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE EXAMPLES I WOULD

03:28:06.107 --> 03:28:09.010 region:rollup2
SAY.

03:28:06.607 --> 03:28:10.044 region:rollup2
WORTH SHARING ONE IS JUST FROM

THAT'S SOMETHING COMING OUT OF

03:28:26.828 --> 03:28:30.598 region:rollup2

THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE UP FOR

03:28:33.835 --> 03:28:36.471 region:rollup2
JUST AN EXAMPLE A ROVING

SUPERVISOR PROGRAM WHERE WE

03:28:36.471 --> 03:28:39.607 region:rollup2

03:28:39.607 --> 03:28:43.411 region:rollup2
STAFF WHO WERE TRYING TO GET.

03:28:40.742 --> 03:28:44.812 region:rollup2
THEIR HOURS AND IN IN THAT

03:28:43.411 --> 03:28:46.047 region:rollup2
REGION WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO

03:28:44.812 --> 03:28:49.117 region:rollup2
SUPPORT THE LICENSURE OF OVER

03:28:46.047 --> 03:28:50.051 region:rollup2
FIFTY PEOPLE JUST IN THE CENTRAL

03:28:49.117 --> 03:28:51.853 region:rollup2

I AM IN THE SUPERIOR REGION AND

03:28:51.853 --> 03:28:55.690 region:rollup2
WE WERE ABLE TO SEE THAT.

03:28:53.755 --> 03:28:57.658 region:rollup2
REALLY AS A MAJOR INCREASE IN

03:28:55.690 --> 03:28:59.093 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF SOCIAL WORKERS WHO

03:28:57.658 --> 03:29:00.828 region:rollup2

WE'VE HEARD THIS SEVERAL GOING

03:51:10.123 --> 03:51:13.360 region:rollup2
TO AN IN DEPTH WE NEED TO EXPAND

03:51:12.192 --> 03:51:13.993 region:rollup2
THE MEN HEALTH WORKFORCE.

03:51:13.360 --> 03:51:15.228 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU DO WE NEED TO DO IN A

03:51:13.993 --> 03:51:16.830 region:rollup2

TWO TWO PROGRAMS ARE THIRD

03:51:35.615 --> 03:51:41.087 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. IN THE BOTTOM LINE IS

03:51:38.017 --> 03:51:42.288 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE DOING THIS RIGHT IT'S

03:51:41.087 --> 03:51:46.426 region:rollup2
WORKING RIGHT SO WE'RE ACTUALLY

03:51:42.288 --> 03:51:48.027 region:rollup2
MAKING HEADWAY WE ARE EXPANDING

THE SECOND WORKFORCE IN THE

03:51:48.027 --> 03:51:50.764 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. BILLY

03:51:49.396 --> 03:51:53.266 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IS THE DEMAND IS HIGH

03:51:50.764 --> 03:51:54.534 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES FOR THIS ARE LOW.

03:51:53.266 --> 03:51:57.404 region:rollup2
SO WE REALLY ARE LOOKING FOR

03:51:54.534 --> 03:51:58.405 region:rollup2
RESOURCES TO EXPAND WE'RE ABLE

03:51:57.404 --> 03:52:00.440 region:rollup2
TO DO. IT.

03:51:58.405 --> 03:52:01.808 region:rollup2
BEFORE I TALK A LITTLE BIT

LED US TO THIS WHY DID WE'D WANT

03:52:06.513 --> 03:52:11.918 region:rollup2
TO DO THIS AS A GROUP OF MAINLY

03:52:09.015 --> 03:52:14.187 region:rollup2
PHYSICIANS. WERE LARGELY DUALLY

03:52:11.918 --> 03:52:14.654 region:rollup2

THE WORLD.

03:52:22.896 --> 03:52:25.265 region:rollup2
NUMBER TWO.

03:52:24.097 --> 03:52:26.132 region:rollup2
SUICIDE AS WE MENTIONED EARLIER

03:52:25.265 --> 03:52:27.567 region:rollup2
HUGE PROBLEM RIGHT BETWEEN AGES

03:52:26.132 --> 03:52:28.168 region:rollup2
TEN AND THIRTY FOUR TO SECOND

03:52:27.567 --> 03:52:35.842 region:rollup2
LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH THIRTY

03:52:28.168 --> 03:52:37.110 region:rollup2
YEARS EARLIER RELATIVE

03:52:35.842 --> 03:52:38.378 region:rollup2
TO THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE SEVERE

03:52:37.110 --> 03:52:39.179 region:rollup2
MY ILLNESS LARGELY. GOOD

SIXTY.

03:53:04.737 --> 03:53:08.441 region:rollup2
AND POISED TO RETIRE WITHIN THE

03:53:06.139 --> 03:53:09.309 region:rollup2
NEXT DECADE OR SO

03:53:08.441 --> 03:53:09.843 region:rollup2
SERIOUS PROBLEMS LIKE TO TELL

CANNOT BE TO BUILD MORE

03:53:14.214 --> 03:53:16.483 region:rollup2
RESIDENCY PROGRAMS FOR MARRIAGE

03:53:15.248 --> 03:53:19.452 region:rollup2
OF REASONS.

03:53:16.483 --> 03:53:21.020 region:rollup2
THE SOLUTION SO WHERE DO YOU

03:53:19.452 --> 03:53:22.255 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT PCP IS ARE THE FACT TO

03:53:21.020 --> 03:53:24.490 region:rollup2
MY HEALTH PROVIDERS UP TO SIXTY

CARE IN THIS COUNTRY IS.

03:53:25.892 --> 03:53:28.895 region:rollup2
IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING TO

03:53:27.460 --> 03:53:30.029 region:rollup2
GET NOT BY PSYCHIATRISTS NOT BY

PSYCHOLOGISTS M. F. T. SOCIAL

03:53:30.029 --> 03:53:32.298 region:rollup2
WORKERS.

03:53:30.830 --> 03:53:32.966 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF PATIENT

03:53:32.298 --> 03:53:35.201 region:rollup2
SEEN IN THE PRIMARY CARE SETTING

03:53:32.966 --> 03:53:38.171 region:rollup2
ON ANY GIVEN DAY.

03:53:35.201 --> 03:53:38.638 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC ISSUES

03:53:38.171 --> 03:53:39.639 region:rollup2
EIGHTY PERCENT OF ANTI

PC PIECE HAVE A VERY LIMITED

03:53:43.076 --> 03:53:46.079 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE AND TRAINING. IN THIS

03:53:45.111 --> 03:53:47.514 region:rollup2
FIELD OF PSYCHIATRY THAT'S A

03:53:46.079 --> 03:53:48.114 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

03:53:47.514 --> 03:53:49.749 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF

03:53:48.114 --> 03:53:51.184 region:rollup2
ALL THESE PATIENTS FOR EXAMPLE

03:53:49.749 --> 03:53:52.585 region:rollup2
INTERNAL MEDICINE RESIDENT SPEND

03:53:51.184 --> 03:53:53.620 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS.

03:53:52.585 --> 03:53:54.621 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS LEARNING INTRO

03:53:53.620 --> 03:53:56.589 region:rollup2
MEDICINE ADULT MEDICINE DURING

03:53:54.621 --> 03:53:57.657 region:rollup2
THAT TIME.

03:53:56.589 --> 03:53:59.292 region:rollup2
THERE THERE'S NO SPECIFIC

03:53:57.657 --> 03:54:02.362 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENT.

03:53:59.292 --> 03:54:02.829 region:rollup2
TRAINING IN THEIR OF SKYTREE.

03:54:02.362 --> 03:54:03.963 region:rollup2
KEY STUDENTS AND STATE

03:54:02.829 --> 03:54:06.299 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA TWO WEEKS.

TWO WEEKS TRAINING.

03:54:06.299 --> 03:54:07.634 region:rollup2
AND YET THESE ARE THE FOLKS OUT

03:54:07.066 --> 03:54:08.835 region:rollup2
THERE DELIVERING THE CARE.

03:54:07.634 --> 03:54:10.403 region:rollup2
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT P. CP'S

03:54:08.835 --> 03:54:11.337 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY.

03:54:10.403 --> 03:54:13.072 region:rollup2

BUT THEY AT LEAST TREATING

03:54:14.541 --> 03:54:17.610 region:rollup2
TRAINING TO DO SO.

03:54:16.175 --> 03:54:18.912 region:rollup2
SO WE WANTED TO MAKE A

03:54:17.610 --> 03:54:19.979 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE HERE WE WANT TO DIVE

03:54:18.912 --> 03:54:21.714 region:rollup2
INTO THIS AND MAKE SURE WE

03:54:19.979 --> 03:54:23.283 region:rollup2
ADDRESS IT SQUARELY. THIS

03:54:21.714 --> 03:54:24.684 region:rollup2
TRAINING NEW TRAINERS PRIMARY

OF A KIND.

03:54:27.854 --> 03:54:31.391 region:rollup2
SASS FULL MODEL DESIGNED TO

NUMBER TWO.

03:54:43.503 --> 03:54:47.273 region:rollup2
HOW TO TAKE THIS INFORMATION AND

03:54:45.071 --> 03:54:47.907 region:rollup2
DISSEMINATED TO COLLEAGUES?

03:54:47.273 --> 03:54:49.042 region:rollup2
RIGHT WE'RE TEACHING THEM HOW TO

DO THIS

03:54:49.042 --> 03:54:50.977 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY IN UNDERSERVED

03:54:50.076 --> 03:54:52.946 region:rollup2
AREAS ARE FIRST CLASS AT THIRTY

03:54:50.977 --> 03:54:54.480 region:rollup2
FELONS.

03:54:52.946 --> 03:54:57.216 region:rollup2
OUR SECOND CLASS ABOUT FORTY TWO

03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:57.784 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY SIXTY FELLOWS WE WANT

THE DEMAND IS HIGH.

03:55:02.922 --> 03:55:05.224 region:rollup2
FOR THIS THE RESOURCES ARE NOT

03:55:03.890 --> 03:55:06.960 region:rollup2
AT THIS TIME.

03:55:05.224 --> 03:55:08.695 region:rollup2
QUICK SUMMARY OF OUR OUTCOMES

FOR THIS FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM

03:55:08.695 --> 03:55:11.764 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S PAST MEAN EVIDENCE

LAYING OUT THE.

03:58:30.396 --> 03:58:33.399 region:rollup2
RATED FUNDING THAT WE HAD

ALSO.

03:58:44.510 --> 03:58:47.046 region:rollup2
AND I FORGOT TO MENTION THIS

03:58:45.711 --> 03:58:48.214 region:rollup2
EARLIER BECAUSE OF THE DIFFERENT

03:58:47.046 --> 03:58:49.615 region:rollup2
DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN WHICH I'M

03:58:48.214 --> 03:58:51.617 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS CAN RECEIVE MENTAL

03:58:49.615 --> 03:58:53.152 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES SO OBVIOUSLY AND

03:58:51.617 --> 03:58:54.987 region:rollup2
THE BOOK OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY

03:58:53.152 --> 03:58:56.289 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN AROUND THE COUNTIES AND

03:58:54.987 --> 03:58:57.456 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SPECIAL TO MENTAL

03:58:56.289 --> 03:58:59.926 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES TO THE COUNTY

03:58:57.456 --> 03:59:01.127 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH PLANS. BUT ALSO

03:59:04.030 --> 03:59:08.668 region:rollup2
MILD TO MODERATE I'M SERVICES

03:59:06.799 --> 03:59:09.836 region:rollup2
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY I'M IF

03:59:08.668 --> 03:59:10.836 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT ENROLLED IN

03:59:09.836 --> 03:59:12.305 region:rollup2

RECEIVE SERVICES IN FEE FOR

03:59:12.305 --> 03:59:15.708 region:rollup2
SERVICE. SO THERE'S A LOT OF

03:59:14.941 --> 03:59:19.612 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COMPONENTS.

03:59:15.708 --> 03:59:19.912 region:rollup2

.

03:59:20.346 --> 03:59:21.814 region:rollup2
I THINK I ADDRESS THE QUESTION

03:59:21.180 --> 03:59:22.215 region:rollup2
AROUND THE CARVING OUT OF MENTAL

03:59:21.814 --> 03:59:23.649 region:rollup2

03:59:52.144 --> 03:59:54.981 region:rollup2

IT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE IN WHICH

04:00:01.354 --> 04:00:05.258 region:rollup2
BOTH THE COMPLEXITY OF THE CASES

04:00:03.856 --> 04:00:07.393 region:rollup2
THE DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS

04:00:05.258 --> 04:00:09.328 region:rollup2
THAT ARE REQUIRED AND THE.

04:00:07.393 --> 04:00:12.064 region:rollup2
REALLY CLOSE.

04:00:09.328 --> 04:00:14.066 region:rollup2
OVERSIGHT THAT IS INVOLVING

THE OPPOSITE DIRECTION IN TERMS

04:00:18.104 --> 04:00:21.841 region:rollup2

04:00:23.943 --> 04:00:27.947 region:rollup2
CERTAIN CRITERIA THAT THOSE.

04:00:25.745 --> 04:00:28.648 region:rollup2
CRITERIA CLEARLY DOCUMENTED AND

FEDERAL AWAY G. WITHIN THE NEXT

04:00:40.226 --> 04:00:43.195 region:rollup2
FEW MONTHS.

04:00:41.594 --> 04:00:44.230 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE THAT WE WERE

04:00:43.195 --> 04:00:45.865 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFUL.

04:00:44.230 --> 04:00:47.800 region:rollup2
AND WORKING WITH THEM TO READ

04:00:45.865 --> 04:00:49.201 region:rollup2
THREE REVIEWS SEVERAL OF THE

DISPUTED CLAIMS WHICH WERE

04:00:49.201 --> 04:00:52.738 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY LOOK I'M LESSEN THE

04:00:51.003 --> 04:00:53.773 region:rollup2
AMOUNT THAN THE TWO HUNDRED AND

04:00:52.738 --> 04:00:55.741 region:rollup2
THIRTY MILLION WE DON'T KNOW

04:00:53.773 --> 04:00:56.275 region:rollup2
WHAT THAT IS AT THIS TIME THEY

04:00:55.741 --> 04:00:57.176 region:rollup2
WERE GOING TO BE TAKING IT

04:00:56.275 --> 04:00:58.744 region:rollup2
UNDER.

04:00:57.176 --> 04:01:00.813 region:rollup2
SUBMISSION AND AND ISSUING A

04:00:58.744 --> 04:01:02.782 region:rollup2
FINAL REPORT BUT I THINK YOU

04:01:00.813 --> 04:01:04.450 region:rollup2
KNOW WE WOULD ALL AND STIPULATE

04:01:02.782 --> 04:01:05.151 region:rollup2
THAT WE WISH THINGS WERE A LOT

04:01:04.450 --> 04:01:07.820 region:rollup2
MORE.

04:01:05.151 --> 04:01:08.788 region:rollup2
EASY AND FLEXIBLE BUT YOU KNOW

04:01:07.820 --> 04:01:10.323 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE PUBLIC

04:01:08.788 --> 04:01:10.890 region:rollup2
FUNDS IN THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE

04:01:10.323 --> 04:01:11.891 region:rollup2
PUBLIC FUNDS THAT'S PROBABLY

04:01:10.890 --> 04:01:13.659 region:rollup2
NOT.

04:01:11.891 --> 04:01:15.461 region:rollup2
THE MOST

04:01:13.659 --> 04:01:17.930 region:rollup2
I REALISTIC AND HOPE AT THIS

04:01:15.461 --> 04:01:20.333 region:rollup2
POINT IN TIME AND THEN I WILL

04:01:17.930 --> 04:01:22.134 region:rollup2
I'M DEFERRED TO MS GRAY LISTS ON

04:01:20.333 --> 04:01:24.437 region:rollup2
TO SPEAK MOST SPECIFICALLY ABOUT

04:01:22.134 --> 04:01:25.971 region:rollup2
CANS BUT I WANTED TO OPEN THE

04:01:24.437 --> 04:01:27.873 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE.

04:01:25.971 --> 04:01:30.109 region:rollup2
CANS DISCUSSION WITH.

04:01:27.873 --> 04:01:31.077 region:rollup2
YOUR COMMENTS EARLIER AROUND

04:01:30.109 --> 04:01:33.379 region:rollup2
METRICS.

04:01:31.077 --> 04:01:34.914 region:rollup2
AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR US

04:01:33.379 --> 04:01:36.082 region:rollup2
AS A STATE TO HAVE METRICS THIS

04:01:34.914 --> 04:01:37.450 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A VERY LONG PROCESS FOR

04:01:36.082 --> 04:01:39.652 region:rollup2
WHICH.

04:01:37.450 --> 04:01:41.454 region:rollup2
BRENDA HAS BEEN INVOLVED FOR

04:01:39.652 --> 04:01:42.855 region:rollup2
MANY MANY YEARS I'M WE FEEL

04:01:41.454 --> 04:01:45.658 region:rollup2
STRONGLY ABOUT.

04:01:42.855 --> 04:01:47.660 region:rollup2
THE NEED TO HAVE A STANDARDIZED

04:01:45.658 --> 04:01:48.394 region:rollup2
TOOL ACROSS THE STATE WE ALSO

04:01:47.660 --> 04:01:49.628 region:rollup2
FELT.

04:01:48.394 --> 04:01:49.996 region:rollup2
STRONGLY THAT THERE NEEDED TO

04:01:49.628 --> 04:01:51.497 region:rollup2
BE.

04:01:49.996 --> 04:01:53.833 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THAT

04:01:51.497 --> 04:01:54.967 region:rollup2
WERE CAPTURED IN THE DATA SO WE

04:01:53.833 --> 04:01:56.669 region:rollup2
CHOSE TO TOOLS.

04:01:54.967 --> 04:01:58.170 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY WITH THE INTEREST

04:01:56.669 --> 04:01:59.305 region:rollup2
OF HAVING PARENTS

04:01:58.170 --> 04:02:01.240 region:rollup2
AND CAREGIVERS.

04:01:59.305 --> 04:02:03.609 region:rollup2
PROVIDING DATA ON THEIR

04:02:01.240 --> 04:02:03.809 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE OF HOW OUTCOMES WERE

04:02:03.609 --> 04:02:05.211 region:rollup2
BEING.

04:02:03.809 --> 04:02:06.445 region:rollup2
.

04:02:05.211 --> 04:02:07.780 region:rollup2
OVERSEEN AND THEIR PERSPECTIVE

04:02:06.445 --> 04:02:08.781 region:rollup2
OF HOW SERVICES WERE BEING

04:02:07.780 --> 04:02:10.549 region:rollup2
DELIVERED AND IF THEY THOUGHT

04:02:08.781 --> 04:02:12.752 region:rollup2
THEY WERE EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS

04:02:10.549 --> 04:02:14.286 region:rollup2
HAVING A DIFFERENT. DATA ELEMENT

04:02:12.752 --> 04:02:15.988 region:rollup2
THAT CAPTURED ON PROVIDER

04:02:14.286 --> 04:02:17.256 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES AND SO

04:02:15.988 --> 04:02:18.657 region:rollup2
THOSE ARE THE TWO THAT WE CHOSE

04:02:17.256 --> 04:02:20.359 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S A LOT OF.

04:02:18.657 --> 04:02:22.762 region:rollup2
WORK THAT WENT INTO WHY WE

04:02:20.359 --> 04:02:24.330 region:rollup2
CHOSE THOSE BUT I JUST WANTED TO

04:02:22.762 --> 04:02:25.598 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW AND.

04:02:24.330 --> 04:02:27.500 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW STRESSTHE FACT THAT WE

04:02:25.598 --> 04:02:28.434 region:rollup2
FELT THE NEED TO HAVE A COUPLE

04:02:27.500 --> 04:02:30.269 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES THAT WE

04:02:28.434 --> 04:02:31.103 region:rollup2
CAPTURE DATA ON AND WE ALSO FEEL

04:02:30.269 --> 04:02:33.105 region:rollup2
REALLY STRONGLY THAT.

04:02:31.103 --> 04:02:34.040 region:rollup2
.

04:02:33.105 --> 04:02:35.541 region:rollup2
YOU AND OTHERS.

04:02:34.040 --> 04:02:36.976 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO ASK WHAT HOW DO WE

04:02:35.541 --> 04:02:38.511 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THIS IS WORKING AND SO

04:02:36.976 --> 04:02:40.646 region:rollup2
WE NEED TO KIND OF CAPTURE DATA

04:02:38.511 --> 04:02:41.714 region:rollup2
IN A WAY THAT WE CAN. AND DO OUR

04:02:40.646 --> 04:02:42.681 region:rollup2
BEST AND I THINK THAT WE WOULD

04:02:41.714 --> 04:02:44.250 region:rollup2
NEVER STIPULATE THAT THERE'S A

04:02:42.681 --> 04:02:46.018 region:rollup2
PERFECT.

04:02:44.250 --> 04:02:47.620 region:rollup2
DATA MEASUREMENT TOOL THAT WE

04:02:46.018 --> 04:02:49.055 region:rollup2
THINK THAT THE PROCESS THAT WE

04:02:47.620 --> 04:02:50.589 region:rollup2
WENT THROUGH ITS I'M BOTH VERY

04:02:49.055 --> 04:02:52.425 region:rollup2
AND.

04:02:50.589 --> 04:02:53.893 region:rollup2
THOUGHTFUL IT WAS DRAWN OUT AND

04:02:52.425 --> 04:02:55.428 region:rollup2
IT INVOLVES A LOT OF DIFFERENT

04:02:53.893 --> 04:02:57.463 region:rollup2
EXPERTS AND STAKEHOLDERS.

04:02:55.428 --> 04:02:58.197 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

04:02:57.463 --> 04:02:59.932 region:rollup2
FINALLY JUST TO KIND OF GET

04:02:58.197 --> 04:03:02.001 region:rollup2
THROUGH US SOME OF THE QUESTIONS

04:02:59.932 --> 04:03:04.703 region:rollup2
THAT YOU HAD ASSN THE AGENDA.

04:03:02.001 --> 04:03:06.238 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW I'M YOUR BILL AB

04:03:04.703 --> 04:03:08.040 region:rollup2
THREE FORTY AROUND.

04:03:06.238 --> 04:03:09.842 region:rollup2
TRAUMA SCREENING WE ARE

04:03:08.040 --> 04:03:11.877 region:rollup2
PREPARING TO KICK OFF ON THE

04:03:09.842 --> 04:03:13.479 region:rollup2
WORK GROUP AND PURSUANT TO THE

04:03:11.877 --> 04:03:16.215 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION.

04:03:13.479 --> 04:03:16.515 region:rollup2
AND NOT GROUP HAS BEEN COMPOSED

04:03:16.215 --> 04:03:17.616 region:rollup2
OF NOT ONLY.

04:03:16.515 --> 04:03:19.151 region:rollup2
.

04:03:17.616 --> 04:03:21.053 region:rollup2
CLINICIANS FOR WHICH I.

04:03:19.151 --> 04:03:22.388 region:rollup2
WAS VERY SPECIFIC IN WORKING

04:03:21.053 --> 04:03:23.823 region:rollup2
WITH OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS WHICH

04:03:22.388 --> 04:03:25.558 region:rollup2
IS I WANT TO HAVE.

04:03:23.823 --> 04:03:27.226 region:rollup2
CLINICIANS WHO ARE WORKING WITH

04:03:25.558 --> 04:03:28.594 region:rollup2
AFFECTED POPULATIONS BE ON THIS

04:03:27.226 --> 04:03:30.663 region:rollup2
WORK GROUP ON THERE'S A

04:03:28.594 --> 04:03:31.530 region:rollup2
COMPOSITION OF ADVOCATES COUNTY

04:03:30.663 --> 04:03:32.798 region:rollup2
WELFARE.

04:03:31.530 --> 04:03:34.500 region:rollup2
COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:03:32.798 --> 04:03:36.001 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATION.

04:03:34.500 --> 04:03:37.636 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK THAT'S GOING TO

04:03:36.001 --> 04:03:39.205 region:rollup2
KICK OFF AND I THINK THE GOAL OF

04:03:37.636 --> 04:03:39.772 region:rollup2
THAT IS TO LOOK AT THE TOOLS

04:03:39.205 --> 04:03:40.906 region:rollup2
THAT WE CURRENTLY USE AND TO

04:03:39.772 --> 04:03:42.241 region:rollup2
SAY.

04:03:40.906 --> 04:03:44.076 region:rollup2
ARE THESE THE RIGHT.

04:03:42.241 --> 04:03:45.544 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT TOOLS DO THEY

04:03:44.076 --> 04:03:47.480 region:rollup2
CAPTURE THE INFORMATION IN A WAY

04:03:45.544 --> 04:03:48.981 region:rollup2
THAT IS HELPFUL ON IF THERE ARE

04:03:47.480 --> 04:03:50.516 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT ASSESSMENTS THAT CAN

04:03:48.981 --> 04:03:51.784 region:rollup2
OR SHOULD BE DONE WHAT WOULD BE

04:03:50.516 --> 04:03:53.986 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS BY US.

04:03:51.784 --> 04:03:55.287 region:rollup2
CHOOSING THOSE I'M AS THIS

04:03:53.986 --> 04:03:56.555 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT WHAT WITH THE FISCAL

04:03:55.287 --> 04:03:57.389 region:rollup2
IMPLICATIONS BE OBVIOUSLY FOR

04:03:56.555 --> 04:03:59.058 region:rollup2
CHANGING SOME OF THOSE

04:03:57.389 --> 04:04:00.993 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENTS AND SO I WE WERE

04:03:59.058 --> 04:04:01.594 region:rollup2
WILL BE HAPPY TO KIND OF COME

04:04:00.993 --> 04:04:03.262 region:rollup2
BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE AND LET

04:04:01.594 --> 04:04:05.264 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BUT. AND I KNOW THAT

04:04:03.262 --> 04:04:06.198 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE A BOTH STAFF AND OTHERS

04:04:05.264 --> 04:04:07.566 region:rollup2
THAT ARE ON THAT WORK GROUP AS

04:04:06.198 --> 04:04:09.735 region:rollup2
WELL NOT BE OPEN TO THE PUBLIC

04:04:07.566 --> 04:04:10.903 region:rollup2
SO. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

04:04:09.735 --> 04:04:12.571 region:rollup2
DEFER TO.

04:04:10.903 --> 04:04:14.273 region:rollup2
BRENDA ON THE CANS IF THAT'S

04:04:12.571 --> 04:04:15.841 region:rollup2
OKAY BEFORE WE GET THERE.

04:04:14.273 --> 04:04:18.410 region:rollup2
DURING OUR ACES HEARING LAST

04:04:15.841 --> 04:04:20.479 region:rollup2
WEEK I ASKED A CLINICIAN WHO'S

04:04:18.410 --> 04:04:21.213 region:rollup2

.

04:04:49.842 --> 04:04:51.310 region:rollup2
TURN WITH THE PERFORMANCE ARE

04:04:50.442 --> 04:04:52.511 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT LEGISLATION IN TWO

04:04:51.310 --> 04:04:54.613 region:rollup2
THOUSAND TWELVE WE STARTED OF

04:04:52.511 --> 04:04:54.980 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUP.

04:04:54.613 --> 04:04:56.815 region:rollup2
AND.

04:04:54.980 --> 04:04:58.784 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAD I A GROUP OF

04:04:56.815 --> 04:05:00.853 region:rollup2
FOLKS WHO WERE REALLY DEDICATED

04:04:58.784 --> 04:05:02.555 region:rollup2
TO TRYING TO FIND THE RIGHT TOOL

04:05:00.853 --> 04:05:03.589 region:rollup2
FOLKS CAME WITH THEIR DIFFERENT

04:05:02.555 --> 04:05:04.957 region:rollup2
TOOLS THAT THEY WERE INTERESTED

04:05:03.589 --> 04:05:06.825 region:rollup2
IN AND THAT THEY WERE VERY

04:05:04.957 --> 04:05:08.761 region:rollup2
PASSIONATE ABOUT. AND.

04:05:06.825 --> 04:05:10.129 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT THERE WAS A VARIETY

04:05:08.761 --> 04:05:12.331 region:rollup2
OF TOOLS AND.

04:05:10.129 --> 04:05:13.966 region:rollup2
THERE WAS A A DISCUSSION OR A

04:05:12.331 --> 04:05:15.134 region:rollup2
SERIES OF DISCUSSIONS TRYING TO

04:05:13.966 --> 04:05:17.836 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT WHICH TOOL OR COULD

04:05:15.134 --> 04:05:19.138 region:rollup2
WE COULD WE ALLOW FOR ALL TOOLS.

04:05:17.836 --> 04:05:20.873 region:rollup2
ANYTHING VERY QUICKLY THAT

04:05:19.138 --> 04:05:22.141 region:rollup2
THEIR GROUP JUST LEARNED THAT

04:05:20.873 --> 04:05:23.876 region:rollup2
THAT THAT WASN'T POSSIBLE SECOND

04:05:22.141 --> 04:05:25.311 region:rollup2
GETS TO DIRECTOR KANSEN YOUR

04:05:23.876 --> 04:05:27.179 region:rollup2
POINT ABOUT STANDARDIZATION.

04:05:25.311 --> 04:05:28.047 region:rollup2
AND THE GROUP RECOMMENDED THAT

04:05:27.179 --> 04:05:30.149 region:rollup2
WE.

04:05:28.047 --> 04:05:32.084 region:rollup2
DO STUDIES TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

04:05:30.149 --> 04:05:34.019 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE BEST TOOL TO MEASURE

04:05:32.084 --> 04:05:35.387 region:rollup2
I'M CHILDREN YOU FUNCTIONAL

04:05:34.019 --> 04:05:36.555 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES AND SO I WE

04:05:35.387 --> 04:05:39.024 region:rollup2
COMMISSIONED A STUDY.

04:05:36.555 --> 04:05:40.392 region:rollup2
WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION AND

04:05:43.896 --> 04:05:49.134 region:rollup2
EMBARKED ON A PRETTY RIGOROUS

04:05:46.231 --> 04:05:50.903 region:rollup2
PROCESS OMINOUS SIGNAL TO A FEW

04:05:49.134 --> 04:05:55.207 region:rollup2
STUDIES SO.

04:05:50.903 --> 04:05:56.141 region:rollup2
THE INITIAL PART HAD TO DO WITH.

04:05:55.207 --> 04:05:57.376 region:rollup2
I'M DOING A LITERATURE

04:05:56.141 --> 04:05:58.210 region:rollup2
ENVIRONMENTAL SCAN ON TRY TO GET

04:05:57.376 --> 04:05:58.844 region:rollup2
AS MUCH INFORMATION ON CHINA

04:05:58.210 --> 04:05:59.411 region:rollup2
WHAT'S THE STATE TO STAY IN THE

04:05:58.844 --> 04:05:59.979 region:rollup2
TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE.

04:05:59.411 --> 04:06:00.512 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE ALSO SURVEYED

04:05:59.979 --> 04:06:01.447 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO FIND OUT WHAT

04:06:00.512 --> 04:06:03.382 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WERE DOING AND WHAT

04:06:01.447 --> 04:06:06.118 region:rollup2
THEY WERE USING. AND.

04:06:03.382 --> 04:06:09.054 region:rollup2
USING THAT INFORMATION.

04:06:06.118 --> 04:06:10.689 region:rollup2
UCLA HAD DEVELOPED PUBLIC ARE A

04:06:09.054 --> 04:06:12.124 region:rollup2
COMPILATION OF TOOLS THAT WOULD

04:06:10.689 --> 04:06:13.659 region:rollup2
MOVE TO A NEXT LEVEL WHICH IS A

04:06:12.124 --> 04:06:15.361 region:rollup2
MODIFY DEL FI PANEL WHICH SHOWS

04:06:13.659 --> 04:06:17.596 region:rollup2
A. GROUP OF DIFFERENT.

04:06:15.361 --> 04:06:19.398 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES AND EXPERTS SO I'M

04:06:17.596 --> 04:06:20.666 region:rollup2
IT HAD KIDS ARE CONSUMER FAMILY

MEMBERS POSE OUGHT WELLS

04:06:20.666 --> 04:06:25.771 region:rollup2
CLINICIANS AND ADMINISTRATORS SO

04:06:22.635 --> 04:06:26.872 region:rollup2
FRIDAY OF OF PERSPECTIVES.

04:06:25.771 --> 04:06:29.975 region:rollup2
AMENDMENT DID THE MODIFIED

04:06:26.872 --> 04:06:31.477 region:rollup2
DELPHI PANEL REVIEWED THE TOOLS.

04:06:29.975 --> 04:06:33.979 region:rollup2
.

04:06:31.477 --> 04:06:35.014 region:rollup2
ON THAT ARE.

04:06:33.979 --> 04:06:36.782 region:rollup2
THEY ON CERTAIN LIKE ELEVEN

04:06:35.014 --> 04:06:39.318 region:rollup2
CRITERIA SEVERAL CRITERIA.

04:06:36.782 --> 04:06:39.585 region:rollup2
INCLUDING PSYCHOMETRICS ON A

04:06:39.318 --> 04:06:40.919 region:rollup2
PERSONAL.

04:06:39.585 --> 04:06:41.120 region:rollup2
BUT THE PERSPECTIVES BEING

04:06:40.919 --> 04:06:42.655 region:rollup2
BEING.

04:06:41.120 --> 04:06:43.555 region:rollup2
.

04:06:42.655 --> 04:06:45.658 region:rollup2
CAPTURED.

04:06:43.555 --> 04:06:47.459 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TOOK TO

04:06:45.658 --> 04:06:49.328 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER THE TOOL.

04:06:47.459 --> 04:06:51.063 region:rollup2
LANGUAGES THAT IT WAS TO

04:06:49.328 --> 04:06:52.631 region:rollup2
DEVELOP DAM UNAVAILABLE AND.

04:06:51.063 --> 04:06:54.600 region:rollup2
SO THROUGH THAT AND THROUGH

04:06:52.631 --> 04:06:56.135 region:rollup2
THAT ENTIRE PROCESS WHICH WAS

04:06:54.600 --> 04:06:59.938 region:rollup2
QUITE INVOLVED IN LENGTHY.

04:06:56.135 --> 04:07:01.206 region:rollup2
UCLA RECOMMENDED THAT PEDIATRIC

04:06:59.938 --> 04:07:02.541 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS CHUCK WAS THIRTY FIVE.

04:07:01.206 --> 04:07:04.643 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT WAS A VERY

04:07:02.541 --> 04:07:06.712 region:rollup2
CLEAR RECOMMENDATION FROM THEM.

04:07:04.643 --> 04:07:07.946 region:rollup2
VERY CLEAR TOOL THAT MADE UP

04:07:06.712 --> 04:07:09.715 region:rollup2
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE TOP OF THEIR

04:07:07.946 --> 04:07:10.816 region:rollup2
CRITERIA WHEN THEY DID THE FINAL

04:07:09.715 --> 04:07:11.283 region:rollup2
RANKINGS.

04:07:10.816 --> 04:07:14.119 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

04:07:11.283 --> 04:07:15.721 region:rollup2
BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE A CLINICIAN

04:07:14.119 --> 04:07:16.955 region:rollup2
THOMAS LONG BEEN HAULED I'M NOT

04:07:15.721 --> 04:07:18.724 region:rollup2
EVEN IN OUR JOURNAL PERFORMANCE

04:07:16.955 --> 04:07:19.958 region:rollup2
OUTCOME SYSTEM WE'VE HAD

04:07:18.724 --> 04:07:21.126 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES ARE NOT

04:07:19.958 --> 04:07:22.461 region:rollup2
PERSON BUT SYSTEM RAN FROM

04:07:21.126 --> 04:07:24.029 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT TO TWO THOUSAND TWO

04:07:22.461 --> 04:07:25.230 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE. WE DID MULTIPLE

04:07:24.029 --> 04:07:26.765 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVES AT THAT TIME.

04:07:25.230 --> 04:07:27.966 region:rollup2
WE'VE ALSO CONTINUE TO USE

04:07:26.765 --> 04:07:29.935 region:rollup2
MULTIPLE PERSPECTIVES THROUGH

04:07:27.966 --> 04:07:31.804 region:rollup2
OUR CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS SURVEYS

04:07:29.935 --> 04:07:33.472 region:rollup2
THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING FOR. WELL

04:07:31.804 --> 04:07:35.174 region:rollup2
OVER TEN YEARS AND THEN.

04:07:33.472 --> 04:07:36.542 region:rollup2
.

04:07:35.174 --> 04:07:38.177 region:rollup2
AND THEN I ASKED. HIM.

04:07:36.542 --> 04:07:39.278 region:rollup2
.

04:07:38.177 --> 04:07:40.946 region:rollup2
I WAS SO SO WE CONTINUE THAT

04:07:39.278 --> 04:07:41.480 region:rollup2
VALUES TO HAVE MULTIPLE

04:07:40.946 --> 04:07:42.381 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE SO WAS IT JUST

04:07:41.480 --> 04:07:43.749 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

04:07:42.381 --> 04:07:44.350 region:rollup2
MY APPEARING CARE GIVER

04:07:43.749 --> 04:07:45.884 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE BUT ALSO WITH THE

04:07:44.350 --> 04:07:46.618 region:rollup2
CLINICAL PART

04:07:45.884 --> 04:07:48.921 region:rollup2
THAT AS WELL.

04:07:46.618 --> 04:07:50.055 region:rollup2
AND WITHOUT UCLA YOU LOOKING UP

04:07:48.921 --> 04:07:51.790 region:rollup2
THAT MODIFIED DELPHI PANEL THAT

04:07:50.055 --> 04:07:53.792 region:rollup2
THE THE TOOL THEY RECOMMENDED

04:07:51.790 --> 04:07:54.927 region:rollup2
WAS ON CALL THAT A CHILD AND

04:07:53.792 --> 04:07:56.729 region:rollup2
ADOLESCENT FUNCTIONAL ASSESSMENT

04:07:54.927 --> 04:07:57.763 region:rollup2
SCALE. AND THE CALF IS.

04:07:56.729 --> 04:07:59.531 region:rollup2
.

04:07:57.763 --> 04:08:00.199 region:rollup2
WAS ACTUALLY THE ORIGINAL TO ALL

04:07:59.531 --> 04:08:01.266 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAD USED IN THE

04:08:00.199 --> 04:08:02.434 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OUTCOMES SYSTEM IN

04:08:01.266 --> 04:08:03.535 region:rollup2
NINETY EIGHT TWO THOUSAND TWO

04:08:02.434 --> 04:08:04.636 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS KIND OF SURPRISING

04:08:03.535 --> 04:08:06.105 region:rollup2
THAT AFTER ALL THESE YEARS.

04:08:04.636 --> 04:08:08.340 region:rollup2
WE'RE KIND OF AT THAT SEEM TOOL

04:08:06.105 --> 04:08:09.875 region:rollup2
AND UNFORTUNATELY THERE WERE.

04:08:08.340 --> 04:08:11.443 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THOSE

04:08:09.875 --> 04:08:13.345 region:rollup2
THAT TORN OTHER TOOLS ON THAT

04:08:11.443 --> 04:08:15.180 region:rollup2
WERE OUT SELECTED AT THE TIME SO

04:08:13.345 --> 04:08:16.749 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM WAS DISBANDED

04:08:15.180 --> 04:08:18.584 region:rollup2
ON IN TWO THOUSAND TWO.

04:08:16.749 --> 04:08:19.685 region:rollup2
SO THAT NOT BEING A REAL VIABLE

04:08:18.584 --> 04:08:21.620 region:rollup2
OPTION.

04:08:19.685 --> 04:08:24.123 region:rollup2
WE LOOKED ACROSS THE DATA THAT

04:08:21.620 --> 04:08:25.157 region:rollup2
UCLA HAD HAD CAPTURED AND LOOKED

04:08:24.123 --> 04:08:26.225 region:rollup2
AT THE SURVEY DATA ON THE

04:08:25.157 --> 04:08:28.160 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AND THIRTY THREE OF THE

04:08:26.225 --> 04:08:29.962 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAD. BEEN USING THE

04:08:28.160 --> 04:08:30.329 region:rollup2
CANS IN DIFFERENT CAPACITIES AND

04:08:29.962 --> 04:08:32.398 region:rollup2
SO.

04:08:30.329 --> 04:08:35.434 region:rollup2
RATHER THAN STARTING SOMETHING

04:08:32.398 --> 04:08:37.002 region:rollup2
NEW WE CHOSE TO BUILD UPON WHAT

04:08:35.434 --> 04:08:39.037 region:rollup2
WE AT WHAT INFRASTRUCTURE WAS

04:08:37.002 --> 04:08:39.505 region:rollup2
ALREADY IN PLACE. SELECTED THE

04:08:39.037 --> 04:08:41.240 region:rollup2
CANS TO BE THAT PARENT

04:08:39.505 --> 04:08:42.608 region:rollup2
CAREGIVER.

04:08:41.240 --> 04:08:44.443 region:rollup2
ATTRACT THE THE CLINICIAN

04:08:42.608 --> 04:08:46.111 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE AND SO.

04:08:44.443 --> 04:08:47.079 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE WENT THROUGH THE

04:08:46.111 --> 04:08:48.914 region:rollup2
REGULAR BUDGET CYCLE AND SO ON

04:08:47.079 --> 04:08:51.283 region:rollup2
AND SOFORTH AND THEN.

04:08:48.914 --> 04:08:52.317 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WE HAVE HAD SOME.

04:08:51.283 --> 04:08:55.721 region:rollup2
MOVEMENT FOR AS MANY FOLKS AS WE

04:08:52.317 --> 04:08:57.956 region:rollup2
HAVE HAD LIKE YOU GUYS ITS BOOKS

04:08:55.721 --> 04:08:59.425 region:rollup2
OF THEIR FAVORITE TOOLS ON AND

04:08:57.956 --> 04:09:02.261 region:rollup2
THEY REALLY FEEL VERY

04:08:59.425 --> 04:09:04.096 region:rollup2
PASSIONATELY ABOUT FIVE AND SO.

04:09:02.261 --> 04:09:06.064 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE VERY STRONG

04:09:04.096 --> 04:09:10.636 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES FOR THE CANS AND WE

04:09:06.064 --> 04:09:12.638 region:rollup2
HAVE SOME THAT ARE ADVOCATES FOR

04:09:10.636 --> 04:09:13.439 region:rollup2
OTHER SCHOOLS ON THE MCAT.

04:09:12.638 --> 04:09:14.540 region:rollup2
THANK YOU MISS BARLOW WHEN

04:09:13.439 --> 04:09:15.207 region:rollup2

OF.

04:09:15.374 --> 04:09:17.576 region:rollup2
ISSUES CAPTURED IN THE SECTION

04:09:16.942 --> 04:09:18.677 region:rollup2
OF THE AGENDA SO I THOUGHT IT

04:09:17.576 --> 04:09:20.479 region:rollup2
WOULD ADDRESS THE TWO OR THREE

04:09:18.677 --> 04:09:22.548 region:rollup2
OF THOSE JUST REAL QUICKLY. AND

04:09:20.479 --> 04:09:24.917 region:rollup2
I WAS ASKED TO RESPOND TO OUR

04:09:22.548 --> 04:09:25.384 region:rollup2
VIEW ON THE QUALITY AND ACCESS

04:09:24.917 --> 04:09:27.252 region:rollup2
OF.

04:09:25.384 --> 04:09:29.021 region:rollup2
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

04:09:27.252 --> 04:09:30.722 region:rollup2
AT PRESENT AND I THINK AS IS

04:09:29.021 --> 04:09:32.191 region:rollup2
WELL LAID OUT YOUR AGENDA YOU'VE

04:09:30.722 --> 04:09:33.659 region:rollup2
GOT A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THE

04:09:32.191 --> 04:09:35.394 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF PROJECTS THAT ARE

04:09:33.659 --> 04:09:37.429 region:rollup2
UNDER WAY OR SYSTEMS THAT

04:09:35.394 --> 04:09:38.697 region:rollup2
ALREADY EXIST. IN TERMS OF

04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:40.199 region:rollup2
ALLOWING PEOPLE.

04:09:38.697 --> 04:09:42.134 region:rollup2
INCLUDING YOURSELVES AS THIS

04:09:40.199 --> 04:09:43.702 region:rollup2
POLICYMAKERS TO UNDERSTAND THE

04:09:42.134 --> 04:09:45.604 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF ACCESS THAT PEOPLE

04:09:43.702 --> 04:09:47.239 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE SO THE

04:09:45.604 --> 04:09:48.707 region:rollup2
PERFORMANCE OUTCOME SYSTEMS AND

04:09:47.239 --> 04:09:50.375 region:rollup2
THE DASH BOARDS THAT ARE BEING

04:09:48.707 --> 04:09:52.578 region:rollup2
CREATED WILL ALLOW FOR STATEWIDE

04:09:50.375 --> 04:09:54.046 region:rollup2
STORY. AS WELL AS TO LOOK AT

04:09:52.578 --> 04:09:56.615 region:rollup2
EVERY INDIVIDUAL COUNTY ON A

04:09:54.046 --> 04:09:59.117 region:rollup2
VARIETY OF AREAS ONE OF WHICH IS

04:09:56.615 --> 04:10:00.586 region:rollup2
OUR SERVICES TIMELY PROVIDED NO

04:09:59.117 --> 04:10:02.287 region:rollup2
THAT THAT IS WHAT IS THAT ONE OF

04:10:00.586 --> 04:10:04.790 region:rollup2
THE COMMON I'M FRUSTRATIONS THAT

04:10:02.287 --> 04:10:06.291 region:rollup2
WE HEAR FROM. PROVIDERS AS WELL

04:10:04.790 --> 04:10:07.626 region:rollup2
AS ADVOCATES FOR CONSUMERS AND

04:10:06.291 --> 04:10:09.061 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBERS THAT THEY'RE NOT

04:10:07.626 --> 04:10:11.763 region:rollup2
SATISFIED WITH HOW LONG IT MIGHT

04:10:09.061 --> 04:10:13.599 region:rollup2
TAKE TO ACCESS SERVICES AND SO

04:10:11.763 --> 04:10:15.300 region:rollup2
WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS

04:10:13.599 --> 04:10:16.869 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE DEPARTMENTS I AM.

04:10:15.300 --> 04:10:18.804 region:rollup2
EFFORTS TO ESTABLISH A STATE

04:10:16.869 --> 04:10:20.806 region:rollup2
WIDE SET OF STANDARDS AROUND HOW

04:10:18.804 --> 04:10:22.140 region:rollup2
LONG IT OUGHT TO TAKE AND TO BE

04:10:20.806 --> 04:10:23.542 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ACCESS SERVICES

04:10:22.140 --> 04:10:24.676 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY COUNTIES HAVE BEEN

04:10:23.542 --> 04:10:26.278 region:rollup2
ABLE TO ESTABLISH THEIR OWN

04:10:24.676 --> 04:10:29.047 region:rollup2
STANDARDS FOR WHAT'S TIMELY.

04:10:26.278 --> 04:10:29.314 region:rollup2
WILL BE MOVING TO A STATEWIDE

04:10:29.047 --> 04:10:30.916 region:rollup2
STANDARD.

04:10:29.314 --> 04:10:47.232 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY WILL BE ALSO

04:10:30.916 --> 04:10:47.232 region:rollup2
NEEDING TO FOLLOW

04:10:51.036 --> 04:10:54.473 region:rollup2
SO THOSE WILL BE REALLY GOOD

04:10:53.105 --> 04:10:56.408 region:rollup2
GUIDELINES AND WE'LL HAVE SOME

04:10:54.473 --> 04:10:58.377 region:rollup2
GOOD BASELINE MEASURES TO KNOW

04:10:56.408 --> 04:10:59.811 region:rollup2
HOW MUCH MORE WORK WERE LIKELY

04:10:58.377 --> 04:11:00.445 region:rollup2
THEY NEED TO DO YOU. I'M A

04:10:59.811 --> 04:11:02.281 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR AND COMMUNITIES THAT

04:11:00.445 --> 04:11:03.715 region:rollup2
ARE EVEN MORE IMPACTED BY

04:11:02.281 --> 04:11:06.018 region:rollup2
WORKFORCE SHORTAGES OR LACK OF

04:11:03.715 --> 04:11:07.352 region:rollup2
CBO PROVIDERS OR WHERE JUST THE

04:11:06.018 --> 04:11:09.755 region:rollup2
TERRAIN IS DIFFICULT TO TO

04:11:07.352 --> 04:11:10.289 region:rollup2
TRAVERSE FOR CONSUMERS AND

04:11:09.755 --> 04:11:12.691 region:rollup2
FAMILIES TO GET TO CARE.

04:11:10.289 --> 04:11:13.725 region:rollup2
AND SO IN LIGHT OF THAT WE OFTEN

04:11:12.691 --> 04:11:15.227 region:rollup2
RELY ON THINGS LIKE JUST

04:11:13.725 --> 04:11:17.596 region:rollup2
PENETRATION RATE SO WE LOOK AT

04:11:15.227 --> 04:11:19.298 region:rollup2
THE CLAIMS.

04:11:17.596 --> 04:11:20.966 region:rollup2
CUMIN WHO GOT SERVED AND WHAT

04:11:19.298 --> 04:11:23.068 region:rollup2
DID THEY GET THAT'S NOT REALLY

04:11:20.966 --> 04:11:23.869 region:rollup2
TELLING US THE STORY QUITE YET

04:11:23.068 --> 04:11:25.270 region:rollup2
THOUGH.

04:11:23.869 --> 04:11:26.071 region:rollup2
POINT I WAS MAKING EARLIER

04:11:25.270 --> 04:11:27.806 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE MEDICAL SERVICES ACT

04:11:26.071 --> 04:11:29.408 region:rollup2
ARE PEOPLE GETTING HEALTHIER.

04:11:27.806 --> 04:11:30.509 region:rollup2
WHAT KINDS OF OUTCOMES ARE

04:11:29.408 --> 04:11:33.078 region:rollup2
REPRODUCING SO WE HAVE A LONG

04:11:30.509 --> 04:11:34.179 region:rollup2
WAYS TO GO IN THAT AREA?

04:11:33.078 --> 04:11:36.114 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE

04:11:34.179 --> 04:11:38.116 region:rollup2
RECOGNITION WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT

04:11:36.114 --> 04:11:40.218 region:rollup2
WERE FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES

04:11:38.116 --> 04:11:40.919 region:rollup2
AS IT RELATES TO QUALITY AND

04:11:40.218 --> 04:11:42.754 region:rollup2
ACCESS.

04:11:40.919 --> 04:11:43.689 region:rollup2
SOME OF WHICH ARE A WORKFORCE

04:11:42.754 --> 04:11:45.290 region:rollup2
SHORTAGES WHICH YOU JUST HURT

04:11:43.689 --> 04:11:46.892 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT ABOUT WE HAVE A

04:11:45.290 --> 04:11:48.360 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF FUNDING STREAMS THAT

04:11:46.892 --> 04:11:49.895 region:rollup2
THROUGH REALIGNMENT WERE ALL

04:11:48.360 --> 04:11:51.930 region:rollup2
MANAGING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO

04:11:49.895 --> 04:11:53.398 region:rollup2
TRY TO MEET NEED. BUT THEY ARE

04:11:51.930 --> 04:11:55.400 region:rollup2
FAIRLY DISCONNECTED AS IT

04:11:53.398 --> 04:11:57.669 region:rollup2
RELATES TO THE RULES THE TARGET

04:11:55.400 --> 04:11:58.870 region:rollup2
POPULATIONS SO COUNTIES WHILE

04:11:57.669 --> 04:12:00.806 region:rollup2
THEY ARE MANAGING OF AN ARRAY OF

04:11:58.870 --> 04:12:02.107 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH DEDICATED

04:12:00.806 --> 04:12:04.876 region:rollup2
FUNDING STREAMS THERE ARE.

04:12:02.107 --> 04:12:06.478 region:rollup2
SILOS IN WHICH THOSE THOSE

04:12:04.876 --> 04:12:07.112 region:rollup2
FUNDS COME WITH AND THAT IS THE

04:12:06.478 --> 04:12:09.314 region:rollup2
DIFFICULTY.

04:12:07.112 --> 04:12:11.416 region:rollup2
WE DO RECOGNIZE THAT DESPITE

04:12:09.314 --> 04:12:13.652 region:rollup2
OUR BEST EFFORTS COUNTIES I'M

04:12:11.416 --> 04:12:14.820 region:rollup2
HERE THAT IT HARD IS HARD TO

04:12:13.652 --> 04:12:15.621 region:rollup2
NAVIGATE HOW TO GET HELP.

04:12:14.820 --> 04:12:16.922 region:rollup2
FROM A CONSUMER AND FAMILY

04:12:15.621 --> 04:12:17.556 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE KNOWING WHETHER

04:12:16.922 --> 04:12:20.092 region:rollup2
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO START WITH

04:12:17.556 --> 04:12:21.994 region:rollup2
THE DOCTOR A THERAPIST HAD EVEN

04:12:20.092 --> 04:12:23.729 region:rollup2
FIND ONE IF MEDI CAL IS YOUR

04:12:21.994 --> 04:12:25.130 region:rollup2
COVERAGE WHERE DO YOU BEGIN THAT

04:12:23.729 --> 04:12:26.965 region:rollup2
PROCESS WE RECOGNIZE

04:12:25.130 --> 04:12:27.532 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS ARE NEEDED AND HOW

04:12:26.965 --> 04:12:28.934 region:rollup2
HOW TO HELP PEOPLE NAVIGATE

04:12:27.532 --> 04:12:30.669 region:rollup2
CARE.

04:12:28.934 --> 04:12:32.304 region:rollup2
AND THEN ONE PHRASE THAT WE KNOW

04:12:30.669 --> 04:12:34.640 region:rollup2
WE'RE HEARING A LOT THAT'S NOT

04:12:32.304 --> 04:12:36.541 region:rollup2
WORKING WELL FOR OUR USERS OF

04:12:34.640 --> 04:12:37.943 region:rollup2
OUR SERVICES IS THE CONCEPT OF

04:12:36.541 --> 04:12:39.878 region:rollup2
YOU'VE SEEN ONE COUNTY YOU'VE

04:12:37.943 --> 04:12:42.114 region:rollup2
SEEN ONE COUNTY. AND WHILE ON

04:12:39.878 --> 04:12:43.749 region:rollup2
ONE HAND THAT'S A REAL ASSET

04:12:42.114 --> 04:12:44.883 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE DIVERSE COMMUNITIES

04:12:43.749 --> 04:12:46.118 region:rollup2
AND THERE NEEDS TO BE A

04:12:44.883 --> 04:12:48.687 region:rollup2
RESPONSIVENESS TO REFLECT.

04:12:46.118 --> 04:12:50.489 region:rollup2
THE LOCAL POPULATION AND YOUR

04:12:48.687 --> 04:12:52.290 region:rollup2
LOCAL PRIORITIES THAT THERE

04:12:50.489 --> 04:12:54.559 region:rollup2
OUGHT TO REALLY BE A STANDARD OF

04:12:52.290 --> 04:12:56.261 region:rollup2
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE THAT ANY

04:12:54.559 --> 04:12:59.498 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL AND ROLL YOU SHOULD BE

04:12:56.261 --> 04:13:02.834 region:rollup2
ABLE TO EXPECT TO GET. A

04:12:59.498 --> 04:13:05.070 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF ITEM WHICH COUNTY

04:13:02.834 --> 04:13:07.472 region:rollup2
THEY HAPPEN TO LIVE AND SO WE

04:13:05.070 --> 04:13:09.541 region:rollup2
KNOW WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO IN

04:13:07.472 --> 04:13:11.743 region:rollup2
THAT AREA. AND THEN I THINK WE

04:13:09.541 --> 04:13:14.379 region:rollup2
ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE TO

04:13:11.743 --> 04:13:16.348 region:rollup2
ANSWER THE CALL TO EXPAND OUR

04:13:14.379 --> 04:13:17.749 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO SERVICES THAT WHETHER

04:13:16.348 --> 04:13:20.318 region:rollup2
IT'S THROUGH PUBLIC SAFETY

04:13:17.749 --> 04:13:21.987 region:rollup2
REALIGNMENT. ARE HOMELESSNESS

04:13:20.318 --> 04:13:25.357 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IN MANY OF OUR

04:13:21.987 --> 04:13:28.093 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES THE OPIOID EPIDEMIC.

04:13:25.357 --> 04:13:29.227 region:rollup2
THE NEED FOR BETTER CARE

04:13:28.093 --> 04:13:31.096 region:rollup2
ANYMORE.

QUICK CARE FOR CHILDREN IN THE

04:13:31.096 --> 04:13:36.768 region:rollup2
FOSTER CARE SYSTEM THAT THERE'S

04:13:33.665 --> 04:13:38.870 region:rollup2
AN ARRAY OF POPULATIONS THAT WE

04:13:36.768 --> 04:13:41.573 region:rollup2
KNOW WE'RE NOT SERVING TO THE

04:13:38.870 --> 04:13:44.176 region:rollup2
DEGREE WE OUGHT TO BE.

04:13:41.573 --> 04:13:45.711 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR PENETRATION

04:13:44.176 --> 04:13:47.345 region:rollup2
RATES IT'S ACTUALLY KIND OF

04:13:45.711 --> 04:13:50.282 region:rollup2
INTERESTING IF YOU LOOK BY

04:13:47.345 --> 04:13:50.749 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS WE SEEM TO BE DOING

04:13:50.282 --> 04:13:54.419 region:rollup2
BETTER IN THE AREAS OF

04:13:50.749 --> 04:13:59.024 region:rollup2
PSYCHOSIS.

04:13:54.419 --> 04:14:00.358 region:rollup2
AND AND BIPOLAR DISORDERS WHICH

04:13:59.024 --> 04:14:04.396 region:rollup2
YOU.

04:14:00.358 --> 04:14:07.232 region:rollup2
TEND TEND TO SEE BECAUSE OF THE

04:14:04.396 --> 04:14:07.799 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS THAT COME WITH THAT

04:14:07.232 --> 04:14:13.338 region:rollup2
MORE SHIRLEY COMING INTO OUR

04:14:07.799 --> 04:14:14.439 region:rollup2
DOORS

04:14:13.338 --> 04:14:15.273 region:rollup2
AND I THINK.

04:14:14.439 --> 04:14:16.475 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE MYTHS IS THAT

04:14:15.273 --> 04:14:18.110 region:rollup2
DEPRESSION IS SOMETHING THAT

04:14:16.475 --> 04:14:20.612 region:rollup2
MOST PEOPLE CAN LIVE

04:14:18.110 --> 04:14:21.313 region:rollup2
SUCCESSFULLY WITH WHEN IN FACT I

04:14:20.612 --> 04:14:22.848 region:rollup2
THINK I'M.

04:14:21.313 --> 04:14:23.982 region:rollup2
INTERNATIONAL RESEARCH SHOWS

04:14:22.848 --> 04:14:25.283 region:rollup2
THAT DEPRESSION IS ONE OF THE

04:14:23.982 --> 04:14:26.585 region:rollup2
MOST DISABLING HEALTH CARE

04:14:25.283 --> 04:14:28.787 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS AMONG ALL HEALTH CARE

04:14:26.585 --> 04:14:30.055 region:rollup2
CONDITIONS AMONG THOSE THINGS

04:14:28.787 --> 04:14:31.790 region:rollup2
THAT ARE CHRONIC. AND CAN AFFECT

04:14:30.055 --> 04:14:33.692 region:rollup2
YOUR ABILITY TO WORK AND LIVE IN

04:14:31.790 --> 04:14:35.327 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY SUCCESSFULLY. AND

MENTAL HEALTH IS TWENTY YEARS

04:14:48.774 --> 04:14:53.445 region:rollup2
OLD AT THIS POINT. AND WE HAVE

04:14:51.910 --> 04:14:54.412 region:rollup2
ANY IDEA SAM WE HAVE NEW

NEW VOICES IN OUR COMMUNITY

04:14:56.782 --> 04:15:00.252 region:rollup2

GETTING MENTAL HEALTH CARE.

AND HAVING IT BE BASED ON

04:15:02.254 --> 04:15:07.192 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS AND IMPAIRMENT MAY OR

04:15:05.157 --> 04:15:10.962 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY FOR US

04:15:07.192 --> 04:15:14.065 region:rollup2
TO MOVE FORWARD. AND SEE BEACH

04:15:10.962 --> 04:15:15.233 region:rollup2
CA HAS DEVELOPED INTERNALLY SO

04:15:14.065 --> 04:15:17.435 region:rollup2
FAR.

04:15:15.233 --> 04:15:19.271 region:rollup2
SOMETHING WERE CALLING THE

IN A FEW YEARS FROM NOW AND

04:15:27.145 --> 04:15:29.881 region:rollup2
SEEING WHETHER THERE MIGHT BE

04:15:28.480 --> 04:15:31.817 region:rollup2
SOME REFORMS THAT WE COULD

04:15:29.881 --> 04:15:36.388 region:rollup2
PROPOSE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

AND TO REALLY.

04:15:52.037 --> 04:16:01.213 region:rollup2
LOOK AT HOW WE TAKE OUR SYSTEM

THROUGHOUT LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

04:16:05.217 --> 04:16:07.853 region:rollup2
WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF WHAT

04:16:05.917 --> 04:16:08.587 region:rollup2
IS AT STAKE. THE WELL BEING OF

04:16:07.853 --> 04:16:10.488 region:rollup2

HEALTH NEEDS IN THE STATE.

04:16:11.656 --> 04:16:14.759 region:rollup2
AND THE NEED TO CORRECTLY

04:16:12.757 --> 04:16:16.528 region:rollup2
EVALUATE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

04:16:14.759 --> 04:16:18.897 region:rollup2
BILLIONS OF STATE AND FEDERAL

04:16:16.528 --> 04:16:19.931 region:rollup2
DOLLARS SPENT ON THEM ANNUALLY.

04:16:18.897 --> 04:16:23.001 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY THE STATE

04:16:19.931 --> 04:16:24.836 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY TWELVE

04:16:23.001 --> 04:16:26.304 region:rollup2

STATE.

04:16:31.710 --> 04:16:35.313 region:rollup2
AND WHAT A DEEP CS FIND AFTER

04:16:33.278 --> 04:16:37.949 region:rollup2
MORE THAN TWO YEARS OF ANALYSIS

04:16:35.313 --> 04:16:38.583 region:rollup2
BY ITS HIRED EXPERTS AT UCLA.

04:16:37.949 --> 04:16:39.551 region:rollup2
BUT THERE WAS ONLY ONE OUTCOME

04:16:38.583 --> 04:16:41.720 region:rollup2
TOOL AS THEY ACKNOWLEDGE THE PSE

04:16:39.551 --> 04:16:42.520 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE.

04:16:41.720 --> 04:16:43.855 region:rollup2
THAT MET ALL THE ESTABLISHED

THIRTY FIVE.

04:16:49.895 --> 04:16:53.565 region:rollup2
BUT A SECOND TOOL THE CANS

04:16:52.297 --> 04:16:54.232 region:rollup2
BUT YOU STILL A I BELIEVE AS IT

04:16:53.565 --> 04:16:54.799 region:rollup2
WAS IN THE CONSULTANTS ANALYSIS

04:16:58.470 --> 04:17:01.406 region:rollup2
WHAT ALL SHOULD THE LEGISLATURE

04:16:59.371 --> 04:17:02.741 region:rollup2
CONSIDER?

04:17:01.406 --> 04:17:03.275 region:rollup2
AS TO THIS CRITICAL ISSUE BEFORE

MEASURING OUTCOMES STATEWIDE.

04:22:14.986 --> 04:22:17.689 region:rollup2
A SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN THE

COUNTIES USE THAT FOR. AT THE

04:22:21.492 --> 04:22:25.430 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CLIENT FAMILY LEVEL

04:22:23.494 --> 04:22:27.165 region:rollup2
IS ITS ABILITY TO ENGAGE A

IN THE COMMUNICATION PROCESS

04:22:28.700 --> 04:22:32.070 region:rollup2
WHICH TAKES THE UNIQUE NESS OF

FAMILIES INTO ACCOUNT. IN

04:22:32.070 --> 04:22:36.274 region:rollup2
DETERMINING HOW. UP IN

04:22:37.709 --> 04:22:41.813 region:rollup2
THIS DOES NOT HOWEVER TRANSLATE.

04:22:40.011 --> 04:22:43.448 region:rollup2
TO AN APPROPRIATE MEASURE AT

04:22:41.813 --> 04:22:44.949 region:rollup2
THE AGGREGATE PROGRAM LEVEL

FOR THE P. STT POPULATION.

04:22:48.987 --> 04:22:52.657 region:rollup2
AND INSTEAD TOWARDS THAT END WE

04:22:51.489 --> 04:22:54.158 region:rollup2
NEED A MEANINGFUL STATISTIC

04:22:52.657 --> 04:22:55.393 region:rollup2
STATISTICAL METRIC THAT CAN BE

04:22:54.158 --> 04:22:57.762 region:rollup2
USED TO SUMMARIZE WHAT IS

IT WAS NOT DESIGNED AS AN

WAS WAY ON UNDERESTIMATED BY DH

04:23:24.188 --> 04:23:29.160 region:rollup2
CS. IN LA ALONE.

04:23:26.624 --> 04:23:31.162 region:rollup2

FOUR HUNDRED CLINICIANS SERVING

04:23:31.162 --> 04:23:35.400 region:rollup2
SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND CLIENTS.

04:23:33.698 --> 04:23:37.168 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATED THE CLINICIANS WILL

04:23:35.400 --> 04:23:39.003 region:rollup2
SPEND BETWEEN AN HOUR AND A HALF

04:23:37.168 --> 04:23:40.838 region:rollup2

04:23:51.282 --> 04:23:55.219 region:rollup2
FROM CLINICAL CARE.

04:23:53.851 --> 04:23:56.554 region:rollup2

IF YOU ARE TRAINING COSTS THAT

04:24:02.393 --> 04:24:08.866 region:rollup2
COULD ADD AN ADDITIONAL THIRTEEN

04:24:05.496 --> 04:24:09.834 region:rollup2

NOT MANDATE THE USE OF THE CANS

THANK YOU.

04:25:29.046 --> 04:25:32.750 region:rollup2
GOOD AFTERNOON.

04:25:31.816 --> 04:25:34.619 region:rollup2
MY NAME IS TERRY MANNERS AND

04:25:32.750 --> 04:25:35.920 region:rollup2
I'M THE PRESIDENT AND CEO AT

HALFWAY SYCAMORES.

04:25:35.920 --> 04:25:38.856 region:rollup2
WE ARE A NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION

04:25:37.722 --> 04:25:40.825 region:rollup2
WE ARE THE LARGEST.

04:25:38.856 --> 04:25:42.927 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDER FOR

04:25:40.825 --> 04:25:44.729 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND LA COUNTY.

04:25:42.927 --> 04:25:45.863 region:rollup2
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING IN THE

04:25:44.729 --> 04:25:47.165 region:rollup2
FIELD AND LICENSED CLINICAL

YEARS.

04:25:48.866 --> 04:25:52.370 region:rollup2
SO THE DECISION TO REQUIRE THE

04:25:50.401 --> 04:25:53.638 region:rollup2
SECONDARY TOOL WHICH WERE

04:25:52.370 --> 04:25:55.273 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING IS THE CANS IS HIGHLY

04:25:53.638 --> 04:25:57.942 region:rollup2
PROB PROBLEMATIC AS IT LACKS

04:25:55.273 --> 04:26:00.044 region:rollup2
SCIENTIFIC. PSYCHOMETRIC DATA TO

04:25:57.942 --> 04:26:01.546 region:rollup2
SUPPORT ITS VALIDITY THERE ARE

04:26:00.044 --> 04:26:02.980 region:rollup2
ALSO SERIOUS CONCERNS.

04:26:01.546 --> 04:26:05.216 region:rollup2
RELATED TO THE RIGOROUS TRAINING

04:26:02.980 --> 04:26:07.051 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS QUALITY CONTROL AND

04:26:05.216 --> 04:26:09.053 region:rollup2
VISIBILITY.

04:26:07.051 --> 04:26:11.556 region:rollup2
THE UCLA REPORT WHICH HAS BEEN

04:26:09.053 --> 04:26:12.723 region:rollup2
DISCUSSED TODAY.

04:26:11.556 --> 04:26:14.459 region:rollup2
REPORTS THE PANELISTS WHO HAD

04:26:12.723 --> 04:26:16.160 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE WITH PRIOR MANDATES

04:26:14.459 --> 04:26:18.462 region:rollup2
OF CANS FELT THAT THE MANDATE

04:26:16.160 --> 04:26:19.564 region:rollup2
BECAUSE FEASIBILITY ISSUES. AND

04:26:18.462 --> 04:26:22.166 region:rollup2
THAT THE TOLL DID NOT LIVE UP TO

04:26:19.564 --> 04:26:23.868 region:rollup2
ITS POTENTIAL. IT ALSO QUESTIONS

04:26:22.166 --> 04:26:25.837 region:rollup2
THE TOOLS VALIDITY AS A MARKER

04:26:23.868 --> 04:26:28.706 region:rollup2
OF EFFECTIVENESS OF CARE.

04:26:25.837 --> 04:26:30.074 region:rollup2
THE CANS DOES NOT HAVE A GOOD

04:26:28.706 --> 04:26:32.443 region:rollup2
SENSITIVITY FOR.

04:26:30.074 --> 04:26:34.378 region:rollup2
RATING FOR THE USE OF AN

04:26:32.443 --> 04:26:36.747 region:rollup2
OUTCOME MEASURE THE TOOL TO BE

04:26:34.378 --> 04:26:38.049 region:rollup2
UTILIZED ACROSS A BROAD RANGE OF

04:26:36.747 --> 04:26:38.749 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND YOUTH WITH VARYING

04:26:38.049 --> 04:26:40.151 region:rollup2
DEGREES OF FUNCTIONAL

04:26:38.749 --> 04:26:41.686 region:rollup2
IMPAIRMENTS.

04:26:40.151 --> 04:26:43.020 region:rollup2
MEANING KIDS EITHER ENTERING

04:26:41.686 --> 04:26:44.589 region:rollup2
INTO THE PREVENTION EARLY

04:26:43.020 --> 04:26:45.957 region:rollup2
INTERVENTION IN OUR KIDS AT THE

04:26:44.589 --> 04:26:47.492 region:rollup2
HIGHEST LEVEL OF CARE AND

04:26:45.957 --> 04:26:48.726 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS TO CARE FOR EXAMPLE.

04:26:47.492 --> 04:26:50.728 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S A SERIOUS INABILITY

04:26:48.726 --> 04:26:52.597 region:rollup2
OF APPROPRIATELY WITH TO REFLECT

04:26:50.728 --> 04:26:55.032 region:rollup2
THE CHANGE OUT AN AGGREGATE

04:26:52.597 --> 04:26:56.200 region:rollup2
PROGRAM LEVEL VERSES THAT THE

04:26:55.032 --> 04:26:58.669 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL TARA LEVEL.

04:26:56.200 --> 04:27:00.738 region:rollup2
SO IN OUR ORGANIZATION WE.

04:26:58.669 --> 04:27:02.073 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN USING THE CANS IN THE

04:27:00.738 --> 04:27:04.542 region:rollup2
CHILD WELFARE PROGRAMS WHICH

04:27:02.073 --> 04:27:05.743 region:rollup2
REQUIRED IT. YEARS AGO IN THE

04:27:04.542 --> 04:27:08.479 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIALLY BASED SERVICES

04:27:05.743 --> 04:27:10.047 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND WE ALSO HAVE BEEN

04:27:08.479 --> 04:27:11.549 region:rollup2
USING THE CAMPUS FOR ABOUT

04:27:10.047 --> 04:27:14.151 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN OR TWENTY YEARS.

04:27:11.549 --> 04:27:15.653 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE. UP PULLED A COHORT OF

04:27:14.151 --> 04:27:18.589 region:rollup2
DATA.

04:27:15.653 --> 04:27:19.790 region:rollup2
AND WE LOOKED AT A SUBSECTION OF

04:27:18.589 --> 04:27:21.425 region:rollup2
YOUTH THAT WERE IN THE HIGHEST

04:27:19.790 --> 04:27:23.694 region:rollup2
LEVEL OF CARE. AND WE LOOK THE

04:27:21.425 --> 04:27:25.196 region:rollup2
SAME DATA FOR THE CANS.

04:27:23.694 --> 04:27:27.431 region:rollup2
CANCER DATA AND WILK THE SAME

04:27:25.196 --> 04:27:29.734 region:rollup2
DATA USING THE CALIPHATE'S

04:27:27.431 --> 04:27:30.201 region:rollup2
AND WHAT YOU COULD SEE IS THAT

04:27:29.734 --> 04:27:32.904 region:rollup2
THE CANS DATA ACTUALLY

04:27:30.201 --> 04:27:33.104 region:rollup2
COLLAPSED.

04:27:32.904 --> 04:27:35.540 region:rollup2
THE.

04:27:33.104 --> 04:27:38.009 region:rollup2
THE AGGREGATE MEASURES AND IT

04:27:35.540 --> 04:27:39.143 region:rollup2
SHOWED VERY LITTLE IMPROVEMENT.

04:27:38.009 --> 04:27:40.945 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOKED AT THE CALPERS

04:27:39.143 --> 04:27:43.481 region:rollup2
DATA IT DID SHOW IMPROVEMENT A

04:27:40.945 --> 04:27:45.950 region:rollup2
IN THE YOUTH.

04:27:43.481 --> 04:27:48.219 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT

04:27:45.950 --> 04:27:49.987 region:rollup2
IT'S AN INABILITY TO SHOW ANY

04:27:48.219 --> 04:27:51.656 region:rollup2
CHANGE AND HOW THESE YOUTH WERE

04:27:49.987 --> 04:27:53.558 region:rollup2
FUNCTIONING WHICH IS WHY WE

04:27:51.656 --> 04:27:54.926 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO USE THE CAPS.

04:27:53.558 --> 04:27:56.294 region:rollup2
SO IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING OR

04:27:54.926 --> 04:27:58.062 region:rollup2
MEASURING CHANGE FOR THIS ENTIRE

04:27:56.294 --> 04:27:59.363 region:rollup2
STATE ADAM WITH A VERY

04:27:58.062 --> 04:28:03.067 region:rollup2
POPULATION.

04:27:59.363 --> 04:28:04.635 region:rollup2
WOULD BE SIMPLY UNUSABLE.

04:28:03.067 --> 04:28:06.904 region:rollup2
A THE JUST ANOTHER NOTE.

04:28:04.635 --> 04:28:07.572 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

04:28:06.904 --> 04:28:09.674 region:rollup2
WAS LOOKED AT.

04:28:07.572 --> 04:28:11.809 region:rollup2
IN USING THE CANS WAS THAT

04:28:09.674 --> 04:28:13.811 region:rollup2
OTHER STATES HAVE USED THE CANS

04:28:11.809 --> 04:28:15.046 region:rollup2
ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND. OUR VICE

04:28:13.811 --> 04:28:17.848 region:rollup2
PRESIDENT OF RESEARCH AND

04:28:15.046 --> 04:28:18.583 region:rollup2
EVALUATION WAS OF FORMALLY A

04:28:17.848 --> 04:28:20.484 region:rollup2
PROFESSOR AT.

04:28:18.583 --> 04:28:22.753 region:rollup2
UNIVERSITY OF MONTANA DURING

04:28:20.484 --> 04:28:24.588 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CANCER

04:28:22.753 --> 04:28:26.991 region:rollup2
THAT STATE. AND SHE IS RELATED

04:28:24.588 --> 04:28:28.492 region:rollup2
TO US THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES

04:28:26.991 --> 04:28:30.027 region:rollup2
THAT MONTANA EXPERIENCE WITH ITS

04:28:28.492 --> 04:28:32.196 region:rollup2
ATTEMPTED USAGE FOR OUTCOME

04:28:30.027 --> 04:28:33.397 region:rollup2
MEASUREMENT. INCLUDING THE LABOR

04:28:32.196 --> 04:28:35.132 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE NATURE OF THE ONGOING

04:28:33.397 --> 04:28:35.833 region:rollup2
ASSESSOR TRAINING AND THE

04:28:35.132 --> 04:28:38.569 region:rollup2
INABILITY.

04:28:35.833 --> 04:28:40.271 region:rollup2
TO DEVELOP A PROPER SCORING

04:28:38.569 --> 04:28:41.472 region:rollup2
MECHANISM FOR CAPTURING AND

04:28:40.271 --> 04:28:43.507 region:rollup2
REPORTING BACK MEANINGFUL DATA

04:28:41.472 --> 04:28:44.909 region:rollup2
SO THE KANSAS NO LONGER BEING

04:28:43.507 --> 04:28:46.677 region:rollup2
USED UP IN MONTANA.

04:28:44.909 --> 04:28:48.145 region:rollup2
I JUST HAVE ONE OTHER COMMENT

04:28:46.677 --> 04:28:50.348 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE CAMPUS THAT WAS MADE

04:28:48.145 --> 04:28:53.184 region:rollup2
EARLIER. ON THE PROBLEM WITH THE

04:28:50.348 --> 04:28:55.186 region:rollup2
KAFIRS WAS NOT THE TOOL.

04:28:53.184 --> 04:28:57.054 region:rollup2
IT WAS THE COST IN IMPLEMENTING

04:28:55.186 --> 04:28:59.690 region:rollup2
THE TOOL AND THE WAY THAT THE

04:28:57.054 --> 04:29:02.193 region:rollup2
STATE OF WAS IMPLEMENTING IT AND

04:28:59.690 --> 04:29:03.327 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE DIFFERENCES. FROM

04:29:02.193 --> 04:29:05.696 region:rollup2
WHEN THE TOOL WAS ORIGINALLY

04:29:03.327 --> 04:29:07.098 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED WAS THAT THE.

04:29:05.696 --> 04:29:09.633 region:rollup2
DEVELOPER OF THE TOOL WAS

04:29:07.098 --> 04:29:11.736 region:rollup2
HIGHLY INVOLVED IN THE TOOL AND

04:29:09.633 --> 04:29:13.371 region:rollup2
SHE IS NO LONGER. INVOLVED WITH

04:29:11.736 --> 04:29:14.739 region:rollup2
THE TOOLS OF THE THE

04:29:13.371 --> 04:29:17.041 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION IS ACTUALLY.

04:29:14.739 --> 04:29:18.976 region:rollup2
I CHANGED OVER TIME SO I JUST

04:29:17.041 --> 04:29:20.177 region:rollup2
WANT TO URGE THE LEGISLATURE. ON

04:29:18.976 --> 04:29:22.413 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA NOT TO GO DOWN THE

04:29:20.177 --> 04:29:27.118 region:rollup2
SAME ROAD AS OF THE STATE OF

PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

04:29:38.529 --> 04:29:41.065 region:rollup2
TWENTY EIGHT CS CARD THE PROCESS

04:29:39.764 --> 04:29:43.034 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED OUTCOME SYSTEM.

04:29:41.065 --> 04:29:45.803 region:rollup2
THEY DID THINGS RIGHT THEY PUT

04:29:43.034 --> 04:29:48.339 region:rollup2
TOGETHER A PERCENT OF EXPERTS TO

04:29:45.803 --> 04:29:50.541 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE FIELD BROADLY AND

04:29:48.339 --> 04:29:52.043 region:rollup2
THEY SELECTED THE TOOLTHAT HAVE

04:29:50.541 --> 04:29:53.978 region:rollup2
SCORED THE BEST AFTER THAT

04:29:52.043 --> 04:29:57.081 region:rollup2
REVIEW. THEN INEXPLICABLY THEY

04:29:53.978 --> 04:29:59.750 region:rollup2
CHOSE A SECOND TOOL THE CANS

04:29:57.081 --> 04:30:01.619 region:rollup2
WHICH US SCORED POORLY IN THAT

04:29:59.750 --> 04:30:03.587 region:rollup2
REVIEW AND IS THE MOST EXPENSIVE

04:30:01.619 --> 04:30:05.723 region:rollup2
AND COMPLEX.

04:30:03.587 --> 04:30:07.491 region:rollup2
TOOLKIT TO IMPLEMENT.

04:30:05.723 --> 04:30:08.726 region:rollup2
IN NAPA COUNTY THE KANSAS GONNA

04:30:07.491 --> 04:30:10.227 region:rollup2
HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE NEGATIVE

04:30:08.726 --> 04:30:12.229 region:rollup2
IMPACT BOTH ON FUNDING AND

04:30:10.227 --> 04:30:13.130 region:rollup2
STAFFING I BELIEVE IT MAY TAKE A

04:30:12.229 --> 04:30:16.434 region:rollup2
FULL TIME.

04:30:13.130 --> 04:30:17.635 region:rollup2
EQUIVALENT POSITION TO MANAGE

04:30:16.434 --> 04:30:19.570 region:rollup2
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CANS

04:30:17.635 --> 04:30:20.905 region:rollup2
OF MY LITTLE TEENY SYSTEM THAT

04:30:19.570 --> 04:30:23.574 region:rollup2
ONE POSITION THE BIG DEAL.

04:30:20.905 --> 04:30:24.742 region:rollup2
AND IT'S GONNA BE DIFFICULT TO

04:30:23.574 --> 04:30:26.043 region:rollup2
GET OUT OF THE BOARD OF

GONNA BE LEERY OF PROMISES THAT

04:30:31.082 --> 04:30:33.651 region:rollup2
THE STATE'S GOING TO COVER THE

04:30:32.116 --> 04:30:35.119 region:rollup2
COSTS OF THIS.

04:30:33.651 --> 04:30:37.455 region:rollup2
IT'S ALSO A DISPROPORTIONATE

04:30:35.119 --> 04:30:39.190 region:rollup2
BURDEN ON CHILDREN AND FAMILIES

04:30:37.455 --> 04:30:40.558 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW ACT A TOWN FAMILY

OUR INTAKE PROCESS AHEAD OF THEM

04:30:42.626 --> 04:30:45.529 region:rollup2
BEFORE THEY GET TO SERVICES

04:30:44.061 --> 04:30:47.731 region:rollup2
I CAN'T ADDS FORTY FIVE MINUTES

04:30:45.529 --> 04:30:50.668 region:rollup2
TO AN HOUR TO THAT. MUCH LONGER

04:30:47.731 --> 04:30:51.235 region:rollup2
THAN MANY OTHER ASSESSMENT TOOLS

04:30:50.668 --> 04:30:53.571 region:rollup2
SO WE.

04:30:51.235 --> 04:30:55.906 region:rollup2
HIM JUST INCREASE THE RISK THAT

04:30:53.571 --> 04:30:56.440 region:rollup2
WE'VE WHERE FAMILIES OUT BEFORE

04:30:55.906 --> 04:30:58.442 region:rollup2
THEY CAN THEY CAN GET TO

04:30:56.440 --> 04:31:02.480 region:rollup2

SERVICES THEMSELF.

04:31:11.789 --> 04:31:14.291 region:rollup2
AND LASTLY THIS APPEARS TO BE A

04:31:13.357 --> 04:31:15.893 region:rollup2
PROJECT THAT SET UP TO FAIL.

04:31:14.291 --> 04:31:18.329 region:rollup2
.

04:31:15.893 --> 04:31:19.830 region:rollup2
WHEREAS TRAINING FOR SOME TOOLS

04:31:18.329 --> 04:31:21.198 region:rollup2

CAN BE BRIEF THIS IS A VERY

04:31:26.904 --> 04:31:30.341 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVE PROCESS.

04:31:28.405 --> 04:31:32.776 region:rollup2
AT THE SAME TIME THAT.

04:31:30.341 --> 04:31:34.411 region:rollup2

ADMINISTRATIONS OF DIFFERENT

04:31:48.058 --> 04:31:53.197 region:rollup2
VERSIONS OF THE SAME TOOL. OUT

04:31:50.694 --> 04:31:53.664 region:rollup2
WHAT THE TIME OF WHAT THE KIND

04:31:53.197 --> 04:31:53.931 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE SPENT IN

04:31:53.664 --> 04:31:55.666 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

04:31:53.931 --> 04:31:57.301 region:rollup2
AND THEN LASTLY WHEN YOU CHOOSE

04:31:55.666 --> 04:31:58.369 region:rollup2
A TOOL THAT'S THIS COMPLICATED

04:31:57.301 --> 04:32:00.704 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE HOURS OF

04:31:58.369 --> 04:32:02.039 region:rollup2
TRAINING THE COMPLEXITY YOU AND

04:32:00.704 --> 04:32:03.707 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN ASSURING PEOPLE ARE

04:32:02.039 --> 04:32:05.876 region:rollup2
DOING THIS WELL. THE AMOUNT OF

04:32:03.707 --> 04:32:07.244 region:rollup2
TIME IT TAKES TO GET THE DATA

04:32:05.876 --> 04:32:08.078 region:rollup2
THE FACT YOU'VE GOT TO ENTER THE

04:32:07.244 --> 04:32:09.046 region:rollup2
UC DATE THAT THAT REALLY WAS

04:32:08.078 --> 04:32:11.015 region:rollup2
NEVER DEVELOPED FOR AGGREGATE

04:32:09.046 --> 04:32:13.250 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES. AND YOU'RE GOING TO DO

04:32:11.015 --> 04:32:14.084 region:rollup2
THAT FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHEN

04:32:13.250 --> 04:32:16.554 region:rollup2
YOU WORK TRYING TO COMEUP WITH

04:32:14.084 --> 04:32:18.622 region:rollup2
A STRONG STATEWIDE EVALUATION

04:32:16.554 --> 04:32:19.523 region:rollup2
YOU RUN A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF

04:32:18.622 --> 04:32:22.092 region:rollup2
FAILING.

04:32:19.523 --> 04:32:23.627 region:rollup2
SO I WANT TO.

04:32:22.092 --> 04:32:24.495 region:rollup2
.

04:32:23.627 --> 04:32:25.729 region:rollup2
IT YOU IT POINT OUT THAT IN IN

04:32:24.495 --> 04:32:26.664 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND TWELVE TWO THOUSAND

04:32:25.729 --> 04:32:28.933 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN NAPA.

04:32:26.664 --> 04:32:30.234 region:rollup2
ADOPTED THE CANS.

04:32:28.933 --> 04:32:31.535 region:rollup2
HOW WE FOUND IT TOO COMPLICATED

04:32:30.234 --> 04:32:33.070 region:rollup2
AND WE FOUND WE DIDN'T GET

04:32:31.535 --> 04:32:35.339 region:rollup2
INFORMATION OUT OF IT THAT?

04:32:33.070 --> 04:32:35.840 region:rollup2
I WAS VALUABLE TO US IT'S A

04:32:35.339 --> 04:32:36.974 region:rollup2
FINE TOOL FOR TREATMENT

PLANNING.

04:32:36.974 --> 04:32:40.578 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT AN OUTCOME TOOL

04:32:38.876 --> 04:32:43.614 region:rollup2
AND IT WAS NOT A GOOD FIT FOR

04:32:40.578 --> 04:32:45.249 region:rollup2
NAPA COUNTY SO. I THINK THE

04:32:43.614 --> 04:32:46.984 region:rollup2
SELECTION OF THE PEDIATRIC

04:32:45.249 --> 04:32:48.519 region:rollup2

04:32:48.519 --> 04:32:55.993 region:rollup2
THAT AND.

04:32:49.553 --> 04:32:56.660 region:rollup2
THAT WE MOVE AWAY FROM

04:32:55.993 --> 04:33:00.030 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CANS

04:32:56.660 --> 04:33:01.565 region:rollup2

RAISING.

04:33:06.737 --> 04:33:10.307 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE D. H. SALES DECISION

04:33:07.771 --> 04:33:14.311 region:rollup2
TO MANDATE THE CANS AS A AS A

THAT WE'RE SO INVOLVED IN THIS

PRODUCE VALID OUTCOMES.

04:33:29.193 --> 04:33:30.661 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE IN SUPPORT OF THE

04:33:29.927 --> 04:33:32.263 region:rollup2
SELECTION OF THE PEDIATRIC

SYMPTOM CHECKLIST THIRTY FIVE AS

04:33:32.263 --> 04:33:35.032 region:rollup2
A SINGLE TOOL TO BE USED IN THIS

04:33:33.530 --> 04:33:36.834 region:rollup2
WAS IDENTIFIED BY THE UCLA

04:33:35.032 --> 04:33:38.936 region:rollup2

ALL OF THE MINIMUM CRITERIA AS

04:33:42.239 --> 04:33:45.643 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED BY THE UCLA EXPERTS.

04:33:44.508 --> 04:33:46.844 region:rollup2

04:33:45.643 --> 04:33:48.812 region:rollup2
SUITED TOOL TO MONITOR THE

04:33:46.844 --> 04:33:49.313 region:rollup2

CRITICAL THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT

04:33:55.286 --> 04:33:58.756 region:rollup2
THE KANSAS AN EXCELLENT

04:33:56.620 --> 04:34:00.291 region:rollup2

HAS NOT BEEN VALIDATED AS SUCH.

04:34:04.762 --> 04:34:07.798 region:rollup2
EXAMINING REPORTING OUT COMES IS

04:34:06.263 --> 04:34:09.266 region:rollup2

04:34:38.796 --> 04:34:41.231 region:rollup2
FAMILY SERVICES I WAS ALSO A

04:34:40.397 --> 04:34:43.834 region:rollup2
MEMBER ON THE PERFORMANCE

04:34:41.231 --> 04:34:45.536 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES SYSTEM WHERE THIS TOOL

04:34:43.834 --> 04:34:47.438 region:rollup2
WAS DEVELOPED. OR DID THIS

04:34:45.536 --> 04:34:49.506 region:rollup2
DECISION WAS MADE. I'M I COULD

04:34:47.438 --> 04:34:51.008 region:rollup2
RESPOND TO ALL THOSE COMMENTS

04:34:49.506 --> 04:34:52.843 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S THEM. I HAVE STRONG

04:34:51.008 --> 04:34:54.178 region:rollup2
FEELINGS ABOUT THEM BUT WE HAVE

04:34:52.843 --> 04:34:56.347 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DONE THAT WITH

04:34:54.178 --> 04:35:00.150 region:rollup2
DOCUMENTATION MULTIPLE SOURCES

04:34:56.347 --> 04:35:04.655 region:rollup2
SO WE'LL MAKE SURE. THAT YOUR

04:35:00.150 --> 04:35:06.924 region:rollup2
OFFICE GETS THOSE IKE WANTED

04:35:04.655 --> 04:35:08.993 region:rollup2
TOUCH ON A COUPLE ITEMS.

04:35:06.924 --> 04:35:09.760 region:rollup2
AND THE CANS IT'S MORE THAN JUST

04:35:08.993 --> 04:35:10.494 region:rollup2
A PIECE OF PAPER THAT PEOPLE

04:35:09.760 --> 04:35:10.995 region:rollup2
FILL OUT.

04:35:10.494 --> 04:35:12.429 region:rollup2
IT IS AN ASSESSMENT AND

04:35:10.995 --> 04:35:12.863 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PLANNING TOOL DESIGNED

04:35:12.429 --> 04:35:14.031 region:rollup2
FOR A COLLABORATIVE

04:35:12.863 --> 04:35:15.966 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATION TO MAKE SURE THAT

04:35:14.031 --> 04:35:16.767 region:rollup2
ALL PERSPECTIVES OF THE CHILD

04:35:15.966 --> 04:35:17.668 region:rollup2
ARE SEEN AT ONE TIME.

04:35:16.767 --> 04:35:18.502 region:rollup2
AND SO AS YOU KNOW FROM WORKING

04:35:17.668 --> 04:35:21.905 region:rollup2
WITH YOUR PATIENTS THERE'S

04:35:18.502 --> 04:35:23.607 region:rollup2
SOMETIMES THAT A PARENT MAY SEE

04:35:21.905 --> 04:35:24.508 region:rollup2
A CHILD IN A COMPLETELY

04:35:23.607 --> 04:35:25.709 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT LIGHT AND THE CHILD

04:35:24.508 --> 04:35:27.644 region:rollup2
MAY ACT VERY DIFFERENT WITH

04:35:25.709 --> 04:35:28.979 region:rollup2
PARENTS AND THEY DO AND SAY. THE

04:35:27.644 --> 04:35:30.114 region:rollup2
SCHOOL SETTING

04:35:28.979 --> 04:35:30.681 region:rollup2
SO THE KANSAS DESIGNS TO HAVE

04:35:30.114 --> 04:35:31.215 region:rollup2
ALL THOSE PEOPLE TO COME

04:35:30.681 --> 04:35:32.783 region:rollup2
TOGETHER AND GIVE ACCURATE

04:35:31.215 --> 04:35:33.550 region:rollup2
RATINGS.

04:35:32.783 --> 04:35:34.885 region:rollup2
OF THE CHILD ON AN ITEM BY ITEM

04:35:33.550 --> 04:35:36.220 region:rollup2
BASIS.

04:35:34.885 --> 04:35:37.588 region:rollup2
AT THE OTHER UNIQUE FEATURE OF

04:35:36.220 --> 04:35:39.123 region:rollup2
THIS TOOL IS THAT ALSO INCLUDES

04:35:37.588 --> 04:35:40.524 region:rollup2
STRENGTHS

04:35:39.123 --> 04:35:42.126 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE AREN'T ANY

04:35:40.524 --> 04:35:43.994 region:rollup2
TRADITIONAL CLINICAL TOOLS THAT

04:35:42.126 --> 04:35:46.463 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THE STRENGTHS AND ITS.

04:35:43.994 --> 04:35:48.465 region:rollup2
FAIRLY EASY ASSN PSYCHOLOGIST I

04:35:46.463 --> 04:35:50.100 region:rollup2
KNOW IN A VERY CONTROLLED

04:35:48.465 --> 04:35:52.269 region:rollup2
SETTING TO DECREASE SYMPTOMS

04:35:50.100 --> 04:35:53.604 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT SO EASY TO IDENTIFY AND

04:35:52.269 --> 04:35:54.505 region:rollup2
BUILD UP THE STRENGTHS.

04:35:53.604 --> 04:35:56.140 region:rollup2
SO MUCH YOU BUILD UP THE

04:35:54.505 --> 04:35:57.574 region:rollup2
STRENGTH YOU ARE NOT GOING TO

04:35:56.140 --> 04:35:59.710 region:rollup2
HAVE A LASTING DIFFERENCE FOR

04:35:57.574 --> 04:36:03.113 region:rollup2
THAT CHILD WERE THAT FAMILY SO

04:35:59.710 --> 04:36:06.216 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPORTANT.

04:36:03.113 --> 04:36:07.484 region:rollup2
HE REPORTS THAT OF THE MANY

04:36:06.216 --> 04:36:08.519 region:rollup2
MEMBERS IN FRONT OF ME OR

04:36:07.484 --> 04:36:10.554 region:rollup2
DISCUSSING IS NOT A PEER

04:36:08.519 --> 04:36:11.255 region:rollup2
REVIEWED REPORTS. AND THAT

04:36:10.554 --> 04:36:14.458 region:rollup2
SINGLE.

04:36:11.255 --> 04:36:15.659 region:rollup2
OPINION FROM A SINGLE PROFESSOR

04:36:14.458 --> 04:36:17.294 region:rollup2
UCD THAT'S NOT

04:36:15.659 --> 04:36:18.495 region:rollup2
A PEER REVIEWED OPINION THERE

04:36:17.294 --> 04:36:20.297 region:rollup2
ARE MULTIPLE CARE REVIEWED

04:36:18.495 --> 04:36:22.299 region:rollup2
REPORTS.

04:36:20.297 --> 04:36:24.334 region:rollup2
THAT ARE DONE NATIONALLY THE

04:36:22.299 --> 04:36:25.736 region:rollup2
MOST RECENT BY DUKE UNIVERSITY

04:36:24.334 --> 04:36:28.272 region:rollup2
THAT SAYS THE CANS IS HIGHLY

04:36:25.736 --> 04:36:31.041 region:rollup2
RATED. AS AN OUTCOME MEASURE.

04:36:28.272 --> 04:36:32.676 region:rollup2
AND AS FAR AS AGGREGATING UP A

04:36:31.041 --> 04:36:34.344 region:rollup2
MANY OF SPEAKERS THAT IT'S OKAY

04:36:32.676 --> 04:36:36.013 region:rollup2
TO IDENTIFY THE OUTCOMES FOR

04:36:34.344 --> 04:36:38.348 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN WELL IF YOU

04:36:36.013 --> 04:36:39.917 region:rollup2
CAN IDENTIFY. FUNCTIONAL

04:36:38.348 --> 04:36:41.085 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES IN IMPROVEMENTS FOR AN

04:36:39.917 --> 04:36:41.685 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL CHILD THAT

04:36:41.085 --> 04:36:43.387 region:rollup2
INFORMATION CAN BE AGGREGATED

04:36:41.685 --> 04:36:46.056 region:rollup2
UP.

04:36:43.387 --> 04:36:47.357 region:rollup2
TO GIVE YOU FUNCTIONAL OUTCOMES

04:36:46.056 --> 04:36:48.492 region:rollup2
ON A PROGRAM LEVEL IN A

04:36:47.357 --> 04:36:51.094 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE LEVEL SO IT DOESN'T

04:36:48.492 --> 04:36:52.162 region:rollup2
MAKE ANY SENSE THAT SOME OF THE

04:36:51.094 --> 04:36:53.163 region:rollup2
FOLKS IN PREMIER SANG.

04:36:52.162 --> 04:36:54.798 region:rollup2
IT'S OKAY ON THE INDIVIDUAL

04:36:53.163 --> 04:36:56.200 region:rollup2
LETTERS LEVEL TO TELL YOU THAT

04:36:54.798 --> 04:36:58.302 region:rollup2
KIDS ARE GETTING BETTER BUT NOT

04:36:56.200 --> 04:37:00.637 region:rollup2
ON A GROUP LEVEL.

04:36:58.302 --> 04:37:01.538 region:rollup2
AND IT ALSO THAT THE MONEY THAT

04:37:00.637 --> 04:37:02.539 region:rollup2
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT DOESN'T

04:37:01.538 --> 04:37:05.209 region:rollup2
MAKE ANY SENSE TO ME EITHER THIS

04:37:02.539 --> 04:37:07.444 region:rollup2
IS A PUBLIC DOMAIN TOOL. SOME OF

04:37:05.209 --> 04:37:09.480 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEMS WITH IMPLEMENTATION

04:37:07.444 --> 04:37:11.448 region:rollup2
THAT THEY HAVE TALKED ABOUT. IS

04:37:09.480 --> 04:37:13.650 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF POOR IMPLEMENTATION

04:37:11.448 --> 04:37:16.653 region:rollup2
IMPORTER TRAINING NOT THE TOOL

04:37:13.650 --> 04:37:17.521 region:rollup2
ITSELF AND SO THAT'S THE REASON

04:37:16.653 --> 04:37:19.790 region:rollup2
D. H. YES IT'S TAKING A LOT OF

04:37:17.521 --> 04:37:21.592 region:rollup2
TIMEAND ATTENTION. TO MAKE SURE

04:37:19.790 --> 04:37:24.194 region:rollup2
THAT THE CLINICIANS IN THE

04:37:21.592 --> 04:37:26.463 region:rollup2
COUNTIES AREREADY AND PROVIDED

04:37:24.194 --> 04:37:28.966 region:rollup2
WITH ADEQUATE TRAINING TO BE

04:37:26.463 --> 04:37:29.700 region:rollup2
ABLE TO USE THIS TOOL THE WAY IT

04:37:28.966 --> 04:37:33.103 region:rollup2
WAS DESIGNED.

04:37:29.700 --> 04:37:34.104 region:rollup2
AS FAR AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME.

04:37:33.103 --> 04:37:34.771 region:rollup2
ADD THIS TOOL IT'S NICE THAT IS

04:37:34.104 --> 04:37:36.440 region:rollup2
BOTH AN ASSESSMENT AND TREATMENT

04:37:34.771 --> 04:37:37.241 region:rollup2
PLANNING TOOL BECAUSE IT'S DONE

04:37:36.440 --> 04:37:38.675 region:rollup2
A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS AND

04:37:37.241 --> 04:37:39.610 region:rollup2
MEETS ALL THE. MEDICAID

04:37:38.675 --> 04:37:40.377 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS

04:37:39.610 --> 04:37:43.247 region:rollup2
FOR.

04:37:40.377 --> 04:37:44.014 region:rollup2
PERSON CENTERED PLANNING HOW

04:37:43.247 --> 04:37:45.182 region:rollup2
WHICH REMOVING TO AND HOLLER

04:37:44.014 --> 04:37:46.750 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS OF CARE WHICH CAN BE

04:37:45.182 --> 04:37:48.485 region:rollup2
DONE ALL AT ONCE SO YOU'RE NOT

04:37:46.750 --> 04:37:50.554 region:rollup2
HAVING TO DO A SEPARATE PROCESS

04:37:48.485 --> 04:37:51.622 region:rollup2
IT IS THE PROCESS IT REPLACES

04:37:50.554 --> 04:37:55.192 region:rollup2
THAT PROCESS.

04:37:51.622 --> 04:37:57.461 region:rollup2
AND THEREFORE IT IS AN EP STT

04:37:55.192 --> 04:37:58.095 region:rollup2
REP REIMBURSABLE PROGRAMS ALL

04:37:57.461 --> 04:37:59.563 region:rollup2
THESE HOURS THAT THEY'RE TALKING

04:37:58.095 --> 04:38:01.198 region:rollup2
ABOUT.

04:37:59.563 --> 04:38:03.066 region:rollup2
CANDY FUNDED BY EPS DUTY EXCEPT

04:38:01.198 --> 04:38:03.700 region:rollup2
THE UP FRONT TRAINING.

04:38:03.066 --> 04:38:07.838 region:rollup2
AND.

04:38:03.700 --> 04:38:09.640 region:rollup2
IT IS USE STATEWIDE IN MORE

04:38:07.838 --> 04:38:10.541 region:rollup2
THAN.

04:38:09.640 --> 04:38:12.409 region:rollup2
FORTY STATE OF STATES I THINK AT

04:38:10.541 --> 04:38:14.111 region:rollup2
THIS POINT.

04:38:12.409 --> 04:38:15.979 region:rollup2
AND SO SOME OF THE STATE THAT

04:38:14.111 --> 04:38:17.781 region:rollup2
WERE REFERENCED WE'RE DONE YEARS

04:38:15.979 --> 04:38:19.783 region:rollup2
AND YEARS AGO WHEN THE. TOOL WAS

04:38:17.781 --> 04:38:20.350 region:rollup2
VERY NEW AND THEY HADN'T GONE

04:38:19.783 --> 04:38:21.018 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE TRIAL AND ERROR

04:38:20.350 --> 04:38:22.753 region:rollup2
PROCESS.

04:38:21.018 --> 04:38:24.855 region:rollup2
SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO MEET WITH

04:38:22.753 --> 04:38:26.557 region:rollup2
YOUR OFFICE AND TALKED TO YOU

04:38:24.855 --> 04:38:28.959 region:rollup2
MORE ABOUT THIS IN DETAIL.

04:38:26.557 --> 04:38:29.927 region:rollup2
I ONE LAST THING I DO WANNA SAY

04:38:28.959 --> 04:38:30.894 region:rollup2
SOMETHING ABOUT THAT SAT

04:38:29.927 --> 04:38:32.529 region:rollup2
DIRECTOR CAN'T SAID AT THE VERY

04:38:30.894 --> 04:38:35.666 region:rollup2
BEGINNING. THAT.

04:38:32.529 --> 04:38:37.568 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE

04:38:35.666 --> 04:38:39.002 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT MILD TO

04:38:37.568 --> 04:38:40.437 region:rollup2
MODERATE BENEFIT THAT IS TO IN

04:38:39.002 --> 04:38:42.406 region:rollup2
ADULTS BUT NOT IN THE CHILDREN

04:38:40.437 --> 04:38:43.941 region:rollup2
SYSTEM. THE CHILDREN'S ITEM

04:38:42.406 --> 04:38:45.776 region:rollup2
SPECIALLY MENTAL HEALTH MEDICAL

04:38:43.941 --> 04:38:47.811 region:rollup2
NECESSITY CRITERIA IS MUCH

04:38:45.776 --> 04:38:50.113 region:rollup2
BROADER AND DEEPER AND SO IT'S

04:38:47.811 --> 04:38:53.684 region:rollup2
KIDS CAN HAVE A VERY VERY MILD

04:38:50.113 --> 04:38:57.721 region:rollup2
NEED. AND STILL MEET SPECIALLY

04:38:53.684 --> 04:38:58.322 region:rollup2

SIR DO YOU HAVE ANOTHER PUBLIC

04:39:03.760 --> 04:39:08.532 region:rollup2
COMMENT.

04:39:06.163 --> 04:39:10.867 region:rollup2
IF YOU'VE MADE A PUBLIC COMMENT.

04:39:08.532 --> 04:39:12.269 region:rollup2
ONCE ALL PROBABLY THAT THEY'RE

04:39:10.867 --> 04:39:14.538 region:rollup2
IF IT'S OKAY JUST BECAUSE WE'RE

04:39:12.269 --> 04:39:15.038 region:rollup2
APPROACHING SEVEN. I DON'T.

04:39:14.538 --> 04:39:19.343 region:rollup2
NORMALLY LIMIT.

04:39:15.038 --> 04:39:22.579 region:rollup2
.

04:39:19.343 --> 04:39:24.648 region:rollup2
IT'S. OBVIOUS THAT WE HAVE NOT.

04:39:22.579 --> 04:39:26.416 region:rollup2
APPARENTLY CAME TO A CONCLUSION.

04:39:24.648 --> 04:39:28.585 region:rollup2
DUE TO THE.

04:39:26.416 --> 04:39:30.687 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES IN OPINION THAT WE

04:39:28.585 --> 04:39:31.722 region:rollup2
HEARD DURING PUBLIC COMMENT AND

04:39:30.687 --> 04:39:33.523 region:rollup2
WANTED TO HEAR FROM THE

04:39:31.722 --> 04:39:35.859 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT AGAIN WHAT. OUR

04:39:33.523 --> 04:39:37.094 region:rollup2
THOUGHT PROCESS WAS.

04:39:35.859 --> 04:39:39.630 region:rollup2
BEHIND THE USE OF KANSAS AN

04:39:37.094 --> 04:39:41.465 region:rollup2
OUTCOME BASED. METRIC WHEN IT

04:39:39.630 --> 04:39:43.900 region:rollup2
APPEARS THAT.

04:39:41.465 --> 04:39:46.036 region:rollup2
THE.

04:39:43.900 --> 04:39:48.005 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION THAT WE HIRED TO

04:39:46.036 --> 04:39:50.007 region:rollup2
HELP US HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO

04:39:48.005 --> 04:39:55.112 region:rollup2
VALIDATE THE OUTCOMES.

04:39:50.007 --> 04:39:56.380 region:rollup2
BEFORE US.

04:39:55.112 --> 04:39:57.881 region:rollup2
I MEAN I'LL DO IT I'LL LET

04:39:56.380 --> 04:39:58.482 region:rollup2
BRENDA CHINA AS WELL AND BECAUSE

04:39:57.881 --> 04:40:00.083 region:rollup2
IT IS.

04:39:58.482 --> 04:40:03.253 region:rollup2
SEVEN AND WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE

04:40:00.083 --> 04:40:04.655 region:rollup2
A PSYCHOMETRIC LEAVE VALID DATA

04:40:03.253 --> 04:40:06.857 region:rollup2
SHARING DISCUSSION.

04:40:04.655 --> 04:40:07.557 region:rollup2
PROBABLY AT THIS POINT IN TIME.

04:40:06.857 --> 04:40:08.659 region:rollup2
.

04:40:07.557 --> 04:40:12.162 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS.

04:40:08.659 --> 04:40:14.131 region:rollup2
.

04:40:12.162 --> 04:40:15.966 region:rollup2
ASIDE FROM THE PSC YOU UCLA

04:40:14.131 --> 04:40:16.533 region:rollup2
LOOKED AT A VARIETY OF TOOLS AND

04:40:15.966 --> 04:40:18.835 region:rollup2
NONE OF THEM OBVIOUSLY STOOD

04:40:16.533 --> 04:40:21.038 region:rollup2
OUT.

04:40:18.835 --> 04:40:22.773 region:rollup2
IN AND THEY ALL HAD THEIR FLAWS

04:40:21.038 --> 04:40:24.941 region:rollup2
THEY ALL HAD THEIR BENEFITS.

04:40:22.773 --> 04:40:26.910 region:rollup2
AS BRENDA SAID.

04:40:24.941 --> 04:40:28.612 region:rollup2
WE HAD TRIED TO USE A DIFFERENT

04:40:26.910 --> 04:40:30.881 region:rollup2
TOOL YEARS AGO AND THAT KIND OF

04:40:28.612 --> 04:40:32.816 region:rollup2
STUFF COLLAPSED IN ITS OWN.

04:40:30.881 --> 04:40:34.985 region:rollup2
WAIT IN TERMS OF.

04:40:32.816 --> 04:40:36.453 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WAS EITHER DIFFICULT

04:40:34.985 --> 04:40:38.722 region:rollup2
OR TIMELY IT WAS OBVIOUSLY

04:40:36.453 --> 04:40:40.724 region:rollup2
EXPENSIVE. AND WE HAVE A VARIETY

04:40:38.722 --> 04:40:41.324 region:rollup2
OF FACTORS THAT WE NEED TO

04:40:40.724 --> 04:40:42.292 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT

04:40:41.324 --> 04:40:43.760 region:rollup2
THIS.

04:40:42.292 --> 04:40:45.896 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT A LOT OF.

04:40:43.760 --> 04:40:46.096 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE ALREADY USING THIS

04:40:45.896 --> 04:40:47.664 region:rollup2
TOOL.

04:40:46.096 --> 04:40:49.733 region:rollup2
.

04:40:47.664 --> 04:40:50.901 region:rollup2
FOR INDIVIDUAL ASSESSMENTS ARE

04:40:49.733 --> 04:40:52.102 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL TREATMENT PLANTS WAS

04:40:50.901 --> 04:40:53.603 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ONE.

04:40:52.102 --> 04:40:55.072 region:rollup2
THING FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT

04:40:53.603 --> 04:40:56.606 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WERE FAMILIAR WITH IT

04:40:55.072 --> 04:40:58.241 region:rollup2
WE ALSO HAVE A SISTER DEPARTMENT

04:40:56.606 --> 04:40:59.976 region:rollup2
THAT WAS NEEDING TO LOOK AT THE

04:40:58.241 --> 04:41:00.811 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION OF A TOOL AS IT

04:40:59.976 --> 04:41:03.280 region:rollup2
PERTAINS TO.

04:41:00.811 --> 04:41:04.848 region:rollup2
THEIR CONTAINMENT CARE REFORM

04:41:03.280 --> 04:41:06.249 region:rollup2
AND THEIR CHILD AND FAMILY TEAMS

04:41:04.848 --> 04:41:07.984 region:rollup2
I'M OBVIOUSLY IT DIDN'T MAKE A

04:41:06.249 --> 04:41:08.485 region:rollup2
WHOLE LOT OF SENSE AS TO

04:41:07.984 --> 04:41:09.419 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS TO HAVE TWO

04:41:08.485 --> 04:41:09.619 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT.

04:41:09.419 --> 04:41:11.621 region:rollup2
TOOLS.

04:41:09.619 --> 04:41:12.155 region:rollup2
I WOULD.

04:41:11.621 --> 04:41:13.557 region:rollup2
TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT.

04:41:12.155 --> 04:41:14.157 region:rollup2
.

04:41:13.557 --> 04:41:15.559 region:rollup2
POINT OF PRIVILEGE AND SAY IT

04:41:14.157 --> 04:41:17.561 region:rollup2
IS.

04:41:15.559 --> 04:41:18.662 region:rollup2
CLEAR FROM BOTH DEPARTMENTS

04:41:17.561 --> 04:41:20.964 region:rollup2
WHEN WE HAVE ISSUED GUIDANCE

04:41:18.662 --> 04:41:23.133 region:rollup2
ABOUT USING HANDS ON CHILDREN IN

04:41:20.964 --> 04:41:25.035 region:rollup2
THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM OUR CHILD

04:41:23.133 --> 04:41:26.703 region:rollup2
WELFARE SYSTEM. THAT I'M IF AN

04:41:25.035 --> 04:41:28.305 region:rollup2
ASSESSMENT HAS BEEN DONE BY

04:41:26.703 --> 04:41:30.440 region:rollup2
EITHER THE CHILD WELFARE SIDE OR

04:41:28.305 --> 04:41:32.576 region:rollup2
BY THE HEALTHCARE SIDE THAT WE

04:41:30.440 --> 04:41:34.211 region:rollup2
ARE WORKING ON CLEAR GUIDANCE

04:41:32.576 --> 04:41:36.213 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THOSE DATA.

04:41:34.211 --> 04:41:37.514 region:rollup2
POINTS ARE SHARED SO THAT YOU

04:41:36.213 --> 04:41:39.349 region:rollup2
ARE ASSESSED SEEN.

04:41:37.514 --> 04:41:40.450 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY AND WE'RE

04:41:39.349 --> 04:41:41.918 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY MINDFUL OF THAT.

04:41:40.450 --> 04:41:42.652 region:rollup2
I THINK THERE IS SOMETHING

04:41:41.918 --> 04:41:44.721 region:rollup2
AROUND.

04:41:42.652 --> 04:41:45.889 region:rollup2
OUR CONSIDERATION AROUND THE

04:41:44.721 --> 04:41:47.424 region:rollup2
TIME IT TAKES

04:41:45.889 --> 04:41:48.024 region:rollup2
THE EFFICACY CERTAINLY IT'S A

04:41:47.424 --> 04:41:49.860 region:rollup2
PUBLIC.

04:41:48.024 --> 04:41:51.795 region:rollup2
OPEN ARCHITECTURE IS.

04:41:49.860 --> 04:41:53.130 region:rollup2
.

04:41:51.795 --> 04:41:54.464 region:rollup2
DOCTOR FOLLOWS JUST SAYING SO WE

04:41:53.130 --> 04:41:56.299 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT POINTS

04:41:54.464 --> 04:41:56.833 region:rollup2
OF CONSIDERATION AND THAT I

04:41:56.299 --> 04:41:59.102 region:rollup2
THINK.

04:41:56.833 --> 04:42:01.638 region:rollup2
IT'S SIMPLY ONE OF THOSE THINGS

04:41:59.102 --> 04:42:03.540 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S NOT ONE CLEAR.

04:42:01.638 --> 04:42:04.808 region:rollup2
CHOICE OTHER THAN THE PSE BUT

04:42:03.540 --> 04:42:05.375 region:rollup2
WE ALSO FELT REALLY STRONGLY

04:42:04.808 --> 04:42:07.711 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:42:05.375 --> 04:42:09.546 region:rollup2
THAT'S A PARENT PERSPECTIVE AND

04:42:07.711 --> 04:42:11.181 region:rollup2
TIME AGAIN AS DOCTORS ALL SAID

04:42:09.546 --> 04:42:13.583 region:rollup2
THERE'S OTHER I'M PERSPECTIVES

04:42:11.181 --> 04:42:15.252 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED AND WANT TO CAPTURE

04:42:13.583 --> 04:42:16.286 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE CERTAINLY ABSOLUTELY

04:42:15.252 --> 04:42:17.854 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

04:42:16.286 --> 04:42:19.589 region:rollup2
VOICES AND THEY KNOW THEIR

04:42:17.854 --> 04:42:20.624 region:rollup2
CHILDREN BETTER THAN ANYONE ELSE

04:42:19.589 --> 04:42:22.259 region:rollup2
BUT THERE'S ALSO.

04:42:20.624 --> 04:42:23.527 region:rollup2
CLINICIANS AND OTHERS THAT WE

04:42:22.259 --> 04:42:25.495 region:rollup2
BELIEVE NEED TO BE.

04:42:23.527 --> 04:42:27.397 region:rollup2
BOTH PUTTING AND DATA AS WELL

04:42:25.495 --> 04:42:28.498 region:rollup2
AS HAVING US EVALUATE THAT AND

04:42:27.397 --> 04:42:30.233 region:rollup2
SO.

04:42:28.498 --> 04:42:32.469 region:rollup2
THERE'S MONEY IN THE BUDGET.

04:42:30.233 --> 04:42:33.436 region:rollup2
THAT WAS APPROVED LAST YEAR.

04:42:32.469 --> 04:42:35.105 region:rollup2
WE HAVE NOT.

04:42:33.436 --> 04:42:36.673 region:rollup2
MODIFIED OR CHANGED THE

04:42:35.105 --> 04:42:38.108 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL THERE'S APPROXIMATELY

04:42:36.673 --> 04:42:39.409 region:rollup2
SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR

04:42:38.108 --> 04:42:41.144 region:rollup2
TRAINING.

04:42:39.409 --> 04:42:42.746 region:rollup2
FOR COUNTY STAFF BOTH ON THE

04:42:41.144 --> 04:42:43.680 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN THE PROGRAMMATIC SIDE

04:42:42.746 --> 04:42:45.048 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE INCLUDED SO THAT

04:42:43.680 --> 04:42:46.683 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE FUNDED FORTHESE

04:42:45.048 --> 04:42:48.585 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES. AND SO.

04:42:46.683 --> 04:42:49.486 region:rollup2
WE BELIEVE IT'S MORE IMPORTANT

04:42:48.585 --> 04:42:50.587 region:rollup2
THAT WE.

04:42:49.486 --> 04:42:52.289 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENT.

04:42:50.587 --> 04:42:54.424 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A DATE BY WHICH

04:42:52.289 --> 04:42:55.859 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE TO BE PROVIDING

04:42:54.424 --> 04:42:58.562 region:rollup2
DATA TO US.

04:42:55.859 --> 04:43:00.130 region:rollup2
IN RECOGNITION OF SOME OF THE.

04:42:58.562 --> 04:43:02.799 region:rollup2
CONCERNS WE.

04:43:00.130 --> 04:43:05.001 region:rollup2
LAGGED LA TO THE START OF THE

04:43:02.799 --> 04:43:07.103 region:rollup2
NEW YEAR SO JANUARY.

04:43:05.001 --> 04:43:09.606 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE DONE AS MUCH AS WE

04:43:07.103 --> 04:43:10.674 region:rollup2
CAN WE FEEL TO BE RESPONSIBLE

04:43:09.606 --> 04:43:12.876 region:rollup2
FOR BOTH CHOOSING A TOOL AND

04:43:10.674 --> 04:43:13.510 region:rollup2
CHOOSE AN IMPLEMENTATION. AND

04:43:12.876 --> 04:43:14.311 region:rollup2
THEN THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY

04:43:13.510 --> 04:43:16.079 region:rollup2
IS THAT.

04:43:14.311 --> 04:43:18.248 region:rollup2
WE'D ORIGINALLY WANTED CHILDREN

04:43:16.079 --> 04:43:18.815 region:rollup2
ASSESSED EVERY NINETY DAYS.

04:43:18.248 --> 04:43:21.852 region:rollup2
AND WE.

04:43:18.815 --> 04:43:23.520 region:rollup2
MODIFY THAT TO EVERY SIX MONTHS.

04:43:21.852 --> 04:43:25.822 region:rollup2
WHICH WAS ALSO IN RECOGNITION

04:43:23.520 --> 04:43:28.592 region:rollup2
OF BOTH THE CLINICIAN.

04:43:25.822 --> 04:43:29.826 region:rollup2
TIME AND EFFORT AS WELL AS

04:43:28.592 --> 04:43:31.528 region:rollup2
MONEY TO MAKE SURE THAT KIDS

04:43:29.826 --> 04:43:33.563 region:rollup2
WERE OVERLY ASSASSIN SO YOU KNOW

04:43:31.528 --> 04:43:36.032 region:rollup2
WE FEEL I'M COMFORTABLE WITH THE

04:43:33.563 --> 04:43:37.334 region:rollup2
DECISION AND WE RECOGNIZE THAT.

04:43:36.032 --> 04:43:39.035 region:rollup2
IF WE WOULD HAVE CHOSEN ANY

04:43:37.334 --> 04:43:39.669 region:rollup2
OTHER TOOL YOU WOULD HAVE YOU

04:43:39.035 --> 04:43:41.271 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU WOULD HAVE BEEN HEARING

04:43:39.669 --> 04:43:43.006 region:rollup2
FROM A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SIDE

04:43:41.271 --> 04:43:44.407 region:rollup2
OF OF POPULATION BUT WE FEEL

04:43:43.006 --> 04:43:44.941 region:rollup2
THAT WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE

04:43:44.407 --> 04:43:45.609 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND SO THAT'S WHAT

04:43:44.941 --> 04:43:46.610 region:rollup2
WE'RE.

04:43:45.609 --> 04:43:49.713 region:rollup2
PROPOSING TO DO.

04:43:46.610 --> 04:43:51.548 region:rollup2
I'M.

04:43:49.713 --> 04:43:56.386 region:rollup2
IS THERE ARE THERE ANY LESSONS

04:43:51.548 --> 04:43:57.454 region:rollup2
TO BE LEARNED FROM MONTANA.

04:43:56.386 --> 04:43:58.855 region:rollup2
I DON'T THINK WE KNOW ENOUGH

04:43:57.454 --> 04:44:00.957 region:rollup2
ABOUT MONTANA.

04:43:58.855 --> 04:44:02.392 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN I JUST HEARD IT.

04:44:00.957 --> 04:44:03.593 region:rollup2
AND SO IT DEPENDS ON WHAT

04:44:02.392 --> 04:44:04.794 region:rollup2
NINTENDO WAS USING IT FOR IT

04:44:03.593 --> 04:44:06.863 region:rollup2
DEPENDS ON A LOT OF THINGS AND I

04:44:04.794 --> 04:44:08.064 region:rollup2
THINK AGAIN. AND WE CAN LOOK AT

04:44:06.863 --> 04:44:09.199 region:rollup2
A LOT OF DIFFERENT STATES AND

04:44:08.064 --> 04:44:10.634 region:rollup2
SAY YOU KNOW WHICH SCHOOL DID

04:44:09.199 --> 04:44:12.002 region:rollup2
YOU USE WHAT THAT MEANT FOR THIS

04:44:10.634 --> 04:44:12.569 region:rollup2
PURPOSE ABOUT PURPOSE HOW DID

04:44:12.002 --> 04:44:13.870 region:rollup2
YOU FIND IT HOW DID YOU USE

04:44:12.569 --> 04:44:15.305 region:rollup2
THAT.

04:44:13.870 --> 04:44:17.307 region:rollup2
WHAT WAS THAT MANDATE INVOLVED

04:44:15.305 --> 04:44:22.746 region:rollup2
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING ELSE ABOUT

04:44:17.307 --> 04:44:25.515 region:rollup2
HOW I COULD REACTED MONTANA?

04:44:22.746 --> 04:44:26.850 region:rollup2
I'M.

04:44:25.515 --> 04:44:29.319 region:rollup2
IT I THINK YOU'RE SEEING MY

04:44:26.850 --> 04:44:32.322 region:rollup2
HESITATION TO.

04:44:29.319 --> 04:44:34.391 region:rollup2

THERE'S A A.

04:44:34.391 --> 04:44:38.161 region:rollup2
CLEAR PLAN BEFORE US THAT

04:44:36.426 --> 04:44:40.363 region:rollup2
UNIVERSALLY ACCEPTED EVEN BY

THAT YOU HAVE.

04:44:43.166 --> 04:44:48.505 region:rollup2

ACTUALLY SOLVE THE TWENTY THREE

04:53:09.972 --> 04:53:13.776 region:rollup2
YEAR OLD PROBLEM WHICH IS THE

04:53:11.073 --> 04:53:15.478 region:rollup2
PROBLEM. OF YOU WHEN CHILDREN OR

04:53:13.776 --> 04:53:16.712 region:rollup2
YOUTH ARE PLACED IN FOSTER CARE

04:53:15.478 --> 04:53:18.114 region:rollup2
AND THEN PLACED OUTSIDE THEIR

04:53:16.712 --> 04:53:19.148 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ORIGINAL JURISDICTION

04:53:18.114 --> 04:53:20.383 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT TIME

04:53:19.148 --> 04:53:24.587 region:rollup2
GETTING. DE GETTING.

04:53:20.383 --> 04:53:26.656 region:rollup2
BUT MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

04:53:24.587 --> 04:53:29.592 region:rollup2
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO GET A

04:53:26.656 --> 04:53:32.728 region:rollup2
SERVICES AT ALL WHEN THEY GET

04:53:29.592 --> 04:53:34.096 region:rollup2
SERVICES THERE MARK MORE LIKELY

04:53:32.728 --> 04:53:35.331 region:rollup2
GET FEWER SERVICES AND NOT AS

04:53:34.096 --> 04:53:37.600 region:rollup2
INTENSIVE. SO THAT WAS THE ISSUE

04:53:35.331 --> 04:53:39.402 region:rollup2
AND AND WHAT IT REALLY CAME DOWN

04:53:37.600 --> 04:53:42.305 region:rollup2
TO AS WELL WHEN A YOUNG PERSON'S

04:53:39.402 --> 04:53:42.872 region:rollup2
PLACE THAT A COUNTY. OR ALSO

04:53:42.305 --> 04:53:43.739 region:rollup2
PLACED OUTSIDE THEIR MENTAL

04:53:42.872 --> 04:53:44.774 region:rollup2
HEALTH PLAN

04:53:43.739 --> 04:53:46.109 region:rollup2
WHICH MAKES IT VERY VERY

04:53:44.774 --> 04:53:46.943 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH

04:53:46.109 --> 04:53:47.577 region:rollup2
PLAN THAT TO A RANGERS ARE

04:53:46.943 --> 04:53:49.879 region:rollup2
EITHER PROVIDER RANGE OF

04:53:47.577 --> 04:53:51.647 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

04:53:49.879 --> 04:53:52.381 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WILL THEY NINE DID VERY

04:53:51.647 --> 04:53:53.015 region:rollup2
SIMPLY WILL SHIFT THE

04:53:52.381 --> 04:53:54.250 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY FROM THE COUNTY

04:53:53.015 --> 04:53:56.452 region:rollup2

04:53:56.452 --> 04:53:58.821 region:rollup2
AND SAID OKAY WHERE YOU'RE

04:53:57.019 --> 04:53:59.388 region:rollup2
LIVING IS THE COUNTY THAT'S

04:53:58.821 --> 04:54:00.389 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBLE THEN FOR MENTAL

04:53:59.388 --> 04:54:01.424 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE.

04:54:00.389 --> 04:54:02.058 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING THEN FOLLOWS THE

04:54:01.424 --> 04:54:02.758 region:rollup2
YOUTH THROUGH.

04:54:02.058 --> 04:54:03.259 region:rollup2
THE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN

REALIGNMENT ALLOCATION

04:54:03.259 --> 04:54:05.061 region:rollup2
METHODOLOGY.

04:54:04.460 --> 04:54:05.661 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM THE COUNTIES RUN

04:54:05.061 --> 04:54:06.929 region:rollup2
INTO IS THAT THERE'S ABOUT A

04:54:05.661 --> 04:54:08.297 region:rollup2
THREE YEAR LAG BEFORE THEY START

04:54:06.929 --> 04:54:09.699 region:rollup2
TO SEE THOSE FUNDS THAT THEY

04:54:08.297 --> 04:54:11.367 region:rollup2
HAVE TO PUT OUT IN YEAR ONE AND.

04:54:09.699 --> 04:54:12.969 region:rollup2
THEY START TO SEE THOSE FUNDS

04:54:11.367 --> 04:54:13.469 region:rollup2
ARE TO SHOW UP IN THEIR

04:54:12.969 --> 04:54:14.570 region:rollup2
ALLOCATION YOUR THREE.

04:54:13.469 --> 04:54:17.106 region:rollup2
.

04:54:14.570 --> 04:54:19.475 region:rollup2
PARTICULARLY A IMPACTED BY THIS

04:54:17.106 --> 04:54:21.444 region:rollup2
OR COUNTIES WHERE THERE EITHER A

04:54:19.475 --> 04:54:22.612 region:rollup2
LARGE NUMBER OF OF SD RTP SHORT

04:54:21.444 --> 04:54:23.546 region:rollup2
TERM RESIDENTIAL THERAPEUTIC OF

04:54:22.612 --> 04:54:25.548 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

04:54:23.546 --> 04:54:27.850 region:rollup2
WHERE THERE ARE A LOT OF OF THAT

04:54:25.548 --> 04:54:30.119 region:rollup2
OF RESOURCE FAMILY HOMES WHO

04:54:27.850 --> 04:54:31.721 region:rollup2
RELIED CAN ARE EVER LET KIDS GO

04:54:30.119 --> 04:54:33.389 region:rollup2
OUT OF THE AT AND ABOUT OF

04:54:31.721 --> 04:54:34.457 region:rollup2
COUNTY CARE? THOSE KIDS MAY HAVE

04:54:33.389 --> 04:54:35.958 region:rollup2
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT TO MIDDLE

04:54:34.457 --> 04:54:37.693 region:rollup2
HEALTH NEEDS.

04:54:35.958 --> 04:54:39.328 region:rollup2
WHAT PRO THE PROBLEM THAT IT

04:54:37.693 --> 04:54:40.496 region:rollup2
POSES A CASH FLOW PROBLEM IT'S A

04:54:39.328 --> 04:54:41.397 region:rollup2
IT'S A?

04:54:40.496 --> 04:54:42.532 region:rollup2
IT'S A AS A TEMPORARY CASH FLOW

04:54:41.397 --> 04:54:43.666 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

04:54:42.532 --> 04:54:44.166 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S A REALLY ACUTE CRITICAL

04:54:43.666 --> 04:54:45.101 region:rollup2
CASUAL PROBLEM FOR THIS

04:54:44.166 --> 04:54:46.335 region:rollup2
COUNTIES.

04:54:45.101 --> 04:54:47.103 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE RECOMMENDING THAT ARE

04:54:46.335 --> 04:54:48.638 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS

04:54:47.103 --> 04:54:49.672 region:rollup2
BASICALLY A THAT ACOSTA POOL BE

04:54:48.638 --> 04:54:50.740 region:rollup2
ESTABLISHED A THREE YEAR BECAUSE

04:54:49.672 --> 04:54:52.408 region:rollup2
POLL? ADMINISTERED BY THE

04:54:50.740 --> 04:54:53.910 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO COVER

04:54:52.408 --> 04:54:55.912 region:rollup2
THOSE UPFRONT COSTS.

04:54:53.910 --> 04:54:57.380 region:rollup2
IF WE FIGURE IT'S PROBABLY

04:54:55.912 --> 04:54:59.115 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE BEST INFORMATION

04:54:57.380 --> 04:55:00.683 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE.

04:54:59.115 --> 04:55:03.185 region:rollup2
WHICH COMES OUT OF THE.

04:55:00.683 --> 04:55:03.452 region:rollup2
THE DCS POS DATA AND IT COMES

04:55:03.185 --> 04:55:05.388 region:rollup2
OUT OF.

04:55:03.452 --> 04:55:06.689 region:rollup2
FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT DATA IS

04:55:05.388 --> 04:55:08.724 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S PROBABLY ABOUT FIFTY

04:55:06.689 --> 04:55:10.626 region:rollup2
MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR I SORT OF

04:55:08.724 --> 04:55:11.394 region:rollup2
UP FRONT BEFORE IT STARTS TO

04:55:10.626 --> 04:55:12.962 region:rollup2
CATCH UP.

04:55:11.394 --> 04:55:14.263 region:rollup2
AND THAT FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

04:55:12.962 --> 04:55:16.232 region:rollup2
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION

04:55:14.263 --> 04:55:18.000 region:rollup2
DOLLARS STATE FUNDS TO EVER

04:55:16.232 --> 04:55:22.905 region:rollup2
COUNTY REALIGNMENT DOLLARS AND

04:55:18.000 --> 04:55:22.905 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

04:55:22.972 --> 04:55:25.641 region:rollup2
I'M SO WE THINK THAT IF THE

04:55:25.007 --> 04:55:27.677 region:rollup2
STATE PUTS UP THE TWENTY FIVE

04:55:25.641 --> 04:55:29.178 region:rollup2
MILLION. ASIDE THEN IN THOSE FOR

04:55:27.677 --> 04:55:30.980 region:rollup2
THOSE THREE YEARS ONE TWO THREE

04:55:29.178 --> 04:55:31.914 region:rollup2
BUT PUT IT UP FRONT THE SEVENTY

04:55:30.980 --> 04:55:33.249 region:rollup2
FIVE TO BE HELD US BECAUSE

04:55:31.914 --> 04:55:34.650 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. THAT BY THE END OF THOSE

04:55:33.249 --> 04:55:37.286 region:rollup2
THREE YEARS THING SHOULD BE

04:55:34.650 --> 04:55:37.954 region:rollup2
FAIRLY WELL A SQUARED AWAY.

04:55:37.286 --> 04:55:39.822 region:rollup2
THERE'S THAT THERE'S A QUESTION

04:55:37.954 --> 04:55:40.656 region:rollup2
OF WHETHER OR NOT THEN THAT

04:55:39.822 --> 04:55:42.325 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PAID BACK.

04:55:40.656 --> 04:55:43.392 region:rollup2
AND AND I THINK TO THE IS THAT

04:55:42.325 --> 04:55:44.827 region:rollup2
THE ANSWER THAT'S WORRIED WHERE

04:55:43.392 --> 04:55:46.329 region:rollup2
AGNOSTIC ON THAT.

04:55:44.827 --> 04:55:48.864 region:rollup2
IF INDEED.

04:55:46.329 --> 04:55:50.800 region:rollup2
WE SEE KIDS ARE GETTING SERVE

04:55:48.864 --> 04:55:52.201 region:rollup2
TO ARTS ARE BEFORE IF THEY'RE

04:55:50.800 --> 04:55:53.569 region:rollup2
GETTING THAT ME MORE INTENSIVE

04:55:52.201 --> 04:55:55.037 region:rollup2
SERVICES ARE MORE SERVICES AND

04:55:53.569 --> 04:55:56.038 region:rollup2
AS YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED TO WHAT

04:55:55.037 --> 04:55:57.306 region:rollup2
WE'RE SAYING NOW. THEN IT MAKES

04:55:56.038 --> 04:55:58.441 region:rollup2
SENSE THAT THAT'S ADDITIONAL

04:55:57.306 --> 04:56:00.409 region:rollup2
MONEY THE COUNTIES WERE

04:55:58.441 --> 04:56:02.011 region:rollup2
PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED TO SPEND

04:56:00.409 --> 04:56:02.979 region:rollup2
SHOULD BE PAID BACK.

04:56:02.011 --> 04:56:04.547 region:rollup2
UP ON THE OTHER HAND IF IN FACT

04:56:02.979 --> 04:56:06.182 region:rollup2
NOTHING CHANGES THAT IS TO SAY

04:56:04.547 --> 04:56:07.250 region:rollup2
WE GET BASICALLY FLAT.

04:56:06.182 --> 04:56:09.719 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW FLAT.

04:56:07.250 --> 04:56:10.786 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF SERVICE ARE FLAT

04:56:09.719 --> 04:56:12.355 region:rollup2
THAT EXPENDITURE OF DOLLARS

04:56:10.786 --> 04:56:13.923 region:rollup2
INFUSION SERVICES THAT MAKE

04:56:12.355 --> 04:56:15.358 region:rollup2
SENSE IT WOULD BE PAID BACK.

04:56:13.923 --> 04:56:16.592 region:rollup2
THREE ASKING FOR THAT THE COST

04:56:15.358 --> 04:56:19.462 region:rollup2
POOL AND TO BE WORKED OUT

04:56:16.592 --> 04:56:20.162 region:rollup2
BETWEEN PART OF FINANCE AND THE

FIVE MILLION.

05:01:57.099 --> 05:02:01.770 region:rollup2
AND AS WE'VE HEARD.

05:01:58.968 --> 05:02:02.938 region:rollup2
DELUDE SPIN DIRECTION GIVEN TO

THE COUNTIES ON HOW TO NAVIGATE

05:02:02.938 --> 05:02:06.175 region:rollup2
THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND IT WAS

05:02:04.573 --> 05:02:07.776 region:rollup2
IT'S OUR HOPE THAT IT.

05:02:06.175 --> 05:02:10.245 region:rollup2

COMMUNICATE BETWEEN THE COUNTIES

05:02:11.313 --> 05:02:12.781 region:rollup2

05:02:12.247 --> 05:02:17.486 region:rollup2
THEIR OWN.

CASH FLOW.

05:02:17.486 --> 05:02:21.390 region:rollup2
AND I MIGHT JUST NOTE THAT THE

05:02:19.054 --> 05:02:23.726 region:rollup2
EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS IS MHSAA

05:02:21.390 --> 05:02:25.394 region:rollup2

CREW TO THE VARIOUS COMPONENTS.

05:02:35.604 --> 05:02:39.608 region:rollup2
THAT IT'S FUNDED THAT THAT AT

05:02:46.448 --> 05:02:50.853 region:rollup2
UNDER THAT WAS GENERAL SERVICE

05:02:49.151 --> 05:02:52.154 region:rollup2
LABELS.

05:02:50.853 --> 05:02:53.088 region:rollup2
COM.

05:02:52.154 --> 05:02:54.857 region:rollup2
FINAL QUESTION IS YOU HAVE

05:02:53.088 --> 05:02:56.091 region:rollup2
MENTIONED FEDERAL MATCHING OR

05:02:54.857 --> 05:02:56.659 region:rollup2
COMPONENT OF THIS CAN YOU

05:02:56.091 --> 05:02:59.161 region:rollup2
EXPLAIN THAT FURTHER SO WHEN

05:02:56.659 --> 05:03:00.262 region:rollup2
THE.

05:02:59.161 --> 05:03:01.430 region:rollup2
WHEN THE CHILDREN AT WHEN THAT

05:03:00.262 --> 05:03:01.964 region:rollup2
WHEN THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED

05:03:01.430 --> 05:03:02.731 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE SERVICES ARE

05:03:01.964 --> 05:03:04.033 region:rollup2
BILLED.

05:03:02.731 --> 05:03:07.202 region:rollup2
IT'S A MEDICAL SERVICE MEDICAL

05:03:04.033 --> 05:03:09.371 region:rollup2
BILLABLE SERVICE AND SO THE THE

RATIO ON THAT'S FIFTY PERCENT.

05:03:10.005 --> 05:03:12.441 region:rollup2
SO WHAT'S WHAT'S REQUIRED IS IS

05:03:11.674 --> 05:03:14.109 region:rollup2
