YOU WITH YOUR ALREADY

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.331
IDENTIFYING.

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:26.933
I MEAN IS IT'S A MATTER OF

00:09:26.999 --> 00:09:27.867
ANOTHER SIX MONTHS OR IS IT A

00:09:27.934 --> 00:09:28.868
YEAR OR IS IT.

00:09:28.935 --> 00:09:30.503
IS THAT WOULD THAT BE A MATTER

00:09:30.569 --> 00:09:32.405
OF STAFFING ALSO TO RESOLVE IT

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:34.340
WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF WHERE THIS

00:09:34.407 --> 00:09:36.842
IS ALL GOING AS FAR AS REALLY

00:09:36.909 --> 00:09:37.677
RESOLVING THE ISSUE.

00:09:37.743 --> 00:09:39.245
IN TERMS OF THE SYSTEM ISSUES

00:09:39.312 --> 00:09:40.880
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING STAFFING

00:09:40.947 --> 00:09:43.516
THAT WE HAVE CAN RESOLVE -- IT'S

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:45.384
IT'S A SYSTEM -- CHALLENGE THAT

00:09:45.451 --> 00:09:47.820
WE'RE RUNNING INTO -- AND SO I

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.489
WOULD TO FIX THAT A CONTINUING

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:51.023
TO ENGAGE WITH THIS GIRL.

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.924
HI.

00:09:51.991 --> 00:09:54.160
OKAY SO THAT'S THE THAT'S WHAT

00:09:54.226 --> 00:10:00.266
STILL ON RESULT CORRECT.

00:10:00.333 --> 00:10:01.867
YES YOU CAN LOOK FOR I DON'T

00:10:01.934 --> 00:10:03.469
THINK THAT'S SUFFICIENT THIS IS

00:10:03.536 --> 00:10:07.540
AN AREA OF GREAT IMPORTANCE.

00:10:07.606 --> 00:10:08.607
IT'S AN AREA THAT.

00:10:08.674 --> 00:10:09.508
THE WHOLE AREA IS EMBARRASSING

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:10.943
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:10:11.010 --> 00:10:13.746
ENORMOUSLY.

00:10:13.813 --> 00:10:15.915
IS IT ACTUALLY EQUIPMENT

00:10:15.982 --> 00:10:16.215
[inaudible]

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:18.818
OR SCHEDULING.

00:10:18.884 --> 00:10:20.953
OR WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE PROBLEM

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:24.090
THERE'S THERE'S CONNECTIVITY.

00:10:24.156 --> 00:10:25.358
WE CAN'T SPEAK THE

00:10:25.424 --> 00:10:27.093
RECONNAISSANCE A SYSTEM WE WERE

00:10:27.159 --> 00:10:28.828
IF USERS OF THE SYSTEM SO WE CAN

00:10:28.894 --> 00:10:30.796
SPEAK TO WHAT WE SEE IS WHEN WE

00:10:30.863 --> 00:10:34.200
CLOSE A MONTH -- THERE CERTAIN

00:10:34.266 --> 00:10:35.101
IN AN EXAMPLE.

00:10:35.167 --> 00:10:37.536
TWO FLAVORS WHEN WE CLOSE A

00:10:37.603 --> 00:10:39.005
MONTH BUT WE NEED TO DO IS SET

00:10:39.071 --> 00:10:41.374
OFF CERTAIN SYSTEM PROCESS -- TO

00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:42.008
CLOSE THAT MONTH WHEN YOU SET

00:10:42.074 --> 00:10:44.043
OFF THOSE PROCESSES WE ENCOUNTER

00:10:44.110 --> 00:10:45.311
IN ERROR.

00:10:45.378 --> 00:10:46.879
AND WHICH WHICH PREVENTS IT SO

00:10:46.946 --> 00:10:48.514
THAT IS WHAT WE NEED TO ENGAGE

00:10:48.581 --> 00:10:50.916
WITH WITH HIS CAL TO RESOLVE

00:10:50.983 --> 00:10:52.418
THOSE ERRORS.

00:10:52.485 --> 00:10:57.256
THE PROBLEM IS WITH THE PROVIDER.

00:10:57.323 --> 00:10:57.757
OR IS IT WILL PROVIDERS

00:10:57.823 --> 00:10:59.825
EQUIPMENT.

00:10:59.892 --> 00:11:00.826
I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT.

00:11:00.893 --> 00:11:02.228
ALSO AT THIS POINT MAYBE I CAN

00:11:02.294 --> 00:11:03.562
JUMP IN AND SAY SO AFTER BE JUST

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:05.865
RECENTLY FINISHED A VERY LARGE

00:11:05.931 --> 00:11:07.933
MODERNIZATION EFFORT --

00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.169
THROUGHOUT THAT EFFORT THAT

00:11:10.236 --> 00:11:11.037
NGUYEN IMPLEMENTATION --

00:11:11.103 --> 00:11:13.072
PROBLEMS POP UP AND YOU HAVE TO

00:11:13.139 --> 00:11:14.407
PUT ALL HANDS ON DECK TO FIX

00:11:14.473 --> 00:11:15.574
THOSE PROBLEMS.

00:11:15.641 --> 00:11:16.709
AND THEY CAN BE VERY VERY TO

00:11:16.776 --> 00:11:19.278
NOTS KIND OF THE STATE THAT MS

00:11:19.345 --> 00:11:20.312
CALLOUS AND RIGHT NOW.

00:11:20.379 --> 00:11:21.414
I'M AND I THINK LATE ON THE

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:22.314
AGENDA YOU'LL HEAR FROM FISCAL

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.449
THEMSELVES AND HOPEFULLY THEY'RE

00:11:23.516 --> 00:11:24.417
ABLE TO ANSWER SOME OF YOUR

00:11:24.483 --> 00:11:25.484
POINTED QUESTIONS BOOTS ON THE

00:11:25.551 --> 00:11:25.718
GROUND.

00:11:25.785 --> 00:11:27.153
FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT WE

00:11:27.219 --> 00:11:30.122
KNOW TODAY -- WITH THE INCREASED

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.057
CHANGES IN THE TASK AND REVIEW

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:33.793
TIME.

00:11:33.859 --> 00:11:35.795
THE RESOURCES THAT WE ASK OUR

00:11:35.861 --> 00:11:40.433
SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO COVER THOSE

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:41.834
ONGOING.

00:11:41.901 --> 00:11:43.536
SO THERE COULD BE SURPRISES IN

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:44.603
CHANGES THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF

00:11:44.670 --> 00:11:45.938

00:11:50.443 --> 00:11:52.178
THAT THERE IS A TECHNOLOGY

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:54.146
SOLUTION THAT WILL EVENTUALLY BE

00:11:54.213 --> 00:11:55.714
FOUND AND PUT IN PLACE THAT WILL

00:11:55.781 --> 00:11:58.217
ALLOW US TO BE FULLY AUTOMATED

ON THAT DISCOUNT CAN SUPPORT

00:12:01.253 --> 00:12:03.155
THAT AUTOMATION AND THAT WE WILL

00:12:03.222 --> 00:12:06.025
NOT NEED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.594

00:30:04.102 --> 00:30:05.837
DOLLARS IN THIS B. C. P. REALLY

00:30:05.904 --> 00:30:07.739
ARE TO ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THE

00:30:07.805 --> 00:30:09.807
DEPARTMENTS TO IDENTIFY AND WORK

00:30:09.874 --> 00:30:11.476
WERE REALLY GONE FROM DEVELOPING

00:30:11.543 --> 00:30:13.444
A SYSTEM TO OUR DEVELOPING THE

00:30:13.511 --> 00:30:15.046
PEOPLE TO UTILIZE THE SYSTEM. TO

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:18.316
MAKING SURE THAT -- THE ERRORS

00:30:18.383 --> 00:30:19.784
THAT AFTER HE BE YOU KNOW.

00:30:19.851 --> 00:30:21.519
RAISED AS A CONCERN THAT WE

00:30:21.586 --> 00:30:23.087
CONTINUE TO IDENTIFY THEM IN OUR

00:30:23.154 --> 00:30:25.390
EXPEDITIOUSLY ABLE TO TO PUT

00:30:25.456 --> 00:30:28.660
THEM IN -- TO PRODUCTION AND TO

00:30:28.726 --> 00:30:29.527
TO STOP THEM FROM HAPPENING IN

00:30:29.594 --> 00:30:30.895
SOME CASES IT'S GUARD RAILS

00:30:30.962 --> 00:30:32.497
BECAUSE WE ARE HUMAN BEINGS

00:30:32.564 --> 00:30:35.366
UTILIZING THE SYSTEM.

00:30:35.433 --> 00:30:36.968
AND THERE ARE THERE ARE RULES

00:30:37.035 --> 00:30:37.769
AND SOMETIMES YOU YOU YOU DON'T

00:30:37.835 --> 00:30:39.170
FOLLOW THEM AND SO THERE'S

00:30:39.237 --> 00:30:40.838
THERE'S A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT.

00:30:40.905 --> 00:30:42.173
WAYS THAT WE WILL BE ADDRESSING

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.942
THE NEEDS OF THE DEPARTMENTS --

00:30:44.008 --> 00:30:45.510
BUT WE WILL BE PROVIDING THESE

00:30:45.577 --> 00:30:46.544
RESOURCES.

00:30:46.611 --> 00:30:48.413
SOLELY FOR THAT FUNCTION THAT WE

00:30:48.479 --> 00:30:49.847
ARE LOOKING AT IMPROVING OUR

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:51.583
REPORTING FUNCTIONALITY I WITH

00:30:51.649 --> 00:30:54.252

THOSE VERY CRITICAL NEED TO THE

00:30:57.555 --> 00:30:58.523
DEPARTMENTS.

00:30:58.590 --> 00:31:00.592
THESE RESOURCES WILL ENABLE US

00:31:00.658 --> 00:31:02.727
WE BELIEVE TO GET ALL OF THE

00:31:02.794 --> 00:31:04.662
DEPARTMENTS MONTHS AND CLOSED IN

00:31:04.729 --> 00:31:06.431
OUR SYSTEMS THERE'S THAT THERE'S

00:31:06.497 --> 00:31:07.532
THIS DISCONNECT TO THEIRS.

00:31:07.599 --> 00:31:08.866
THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE ISSUES IN

00:31:08.933 --> 00:31:10.235
THE SYSTEM WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

00:31:10.301 --> 00:31:12.570
GET THOSE DONE AND COMPLETED

00:31:12.637 --> 00:31:14.372
THROUGH THE OCTOBER.

00:31:14.439 --> 00:31:15.773
DEADLINE THAT THE CONTROLLER HAS

00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:16.608
NOW WHETHER OR NOT THEY

00:31:16.674 --> 00:31:19.043
PHYSICALLY ARE A 100% CLOSE ON

00:31:19.110 --> 00:31:20.511
THE ACCOUNTING SIDE.

00:31:20.578 --> 00:31:22.347
THAT LEAVES THE SYSTEM CONTROL

00:31:22.413 --> 00:31:24.282
AND IS AN ACCOUNTING EXERCISE

00:31:24.349 --> 00:31:25.583
AND SO WHILE.

00:31:25.650 --> 00:31:26.718
THESE DOLLARS WILL HELP

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:27.952
ELIMINATE ALL OF THE SYSTEM

00:31:28.019 --> 00:31:30.555
ISSUES THE SYSTEM CONCERNS.

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:31.556
THE ISSUES THAT THE DEPARTMENTS

00:31:31.623 --> 00:31:33.258
ARE HAVING JUST UTILIZING THE

00:31:33.324 --> 00:31:34.325
SYSTEM.

00:31:34.392 --> 00:31:37.395
AND THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT AT

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:39.030
THE END OF THE DAY.

00:31:39.097 --> 00:31:41.132
T. THAT I THE DEPARTMENTS WILL

00:31:41.199 --> 00:31:41.666
HAVE A PERCENT CLOSE THEIR

00:31:41.733 --> 00:31:42.333
MONTHS.

00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:43.868
SO THAT'S WHAT THESE RESOURCES

00:31:43.935 --> 00:31:47.739
ARE FOR EONS I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER.

00:31:47.805 --> 00:31:48.806

NEW PROCESS FOR UPDATING THE

00:32:26.144 --> 00:32:26.678

TO APPROVE THE S. P. R. AND THAT

00:33:01.746 --> 00:33:03.381
LEAVES THE LEGISLATURE LIKELY

00:33:03.448 --> 00:33:04.749
NOT HAVING A UPDATED PROJECT

00:33:04.816 --> 00:33:08.753

S. P. R. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:26.671
FOR THE SUBCOMMITTEE TO MAKE A

00:33:26.738 --> 00:33:28.539

THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS TO

00:33:40.118 --> 00:33:41.652
TRANSACT IN FRISCO -- THE REASON

00:33:41.719 --> 00:33:43.755
WE'RE ASKING FOR THAT IS IN

00:33:43.821 --> 00:33:44.355

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:09.113
HARD TO CROSSWALK THAT.

00:34:49.220 --> 00:34:51.022
IMPLEMENTED TO DATE HAS BEEN A

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:53.891
TRAIN THE TRAINER MODEL WHERE

00:34:53.958 --> 00:34:55.693
FOLKS HAVE COME INTO THE TO THE

A LOT OF ONLINE TRAINING.

00:34:58.663 --> 00:35:00.998
AND WE'VE RECENTLY IN THE PAST

00:35:01.065 --> 00:35:02.767
YEAR BROUGHT NEWS CREATED THESE

00:35:02.834 --> 00:35:04.135
THINGS BECAUSE OF SUPPORT LABS

00:35:04.202 --> 00:35:04.769

HELP THEM GET THROUGH IT.

00:35:09.273 --> 00:35:09.841
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY WELL

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:12.543
WE'VE STANDARDIZED THE SYSTEM TO

00:35:12.610 --> 00:35:14.412
THE EXTENT WE CAN.

00:35:14.479 --> 00:35:15.713
WE STILL REMAIN.

00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:17.381
THE FACT STILL REMAINS THAT WE

00:35:17.448 --> 00:35:18.249
HAVE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY TWO

00:35:18.316 --> 00:35:20.218
DEPARTMENTS WITH A HUNDRED AND

00:35:20.284 --> 00:35:20.852
FIFTY TWO DIFFERENT WAYS TO DO

00:35:20.918 --> 00:35:21.652
THINGS.

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:25.256
THESE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO GO

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:26.858
THEM.

00:35:26.924 --> 00:35:27.792
LEARN THEIR PROCESSES AND READ

00:35:27.859 --> 00:35:29.327
RIGHT THERE PROCESSES TO FIT

00:35:29.393 --> 00:35:32.230
WITHIN THE SYSTEM WE CAN.

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.564
YOU KNOW PUT THE GUARD RAILS

00:35:33.631 --> 00:35:35.399
HAPPEN WE CAN TELL THEM THIS IS

00:35:35.466 --> 00:35:37.001
YOU KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS.

00:35:37.068 --> 00:35:38.436
BUT THERE IS THIS DISCONNECT

00:35:38.503 --> 00:35:39.737
pBETWEEN.

00:35:39.804 --> 00:35:42.273
OKAY THEY'RE THE ONLY DEPARTMENT

00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:44.575
IN THE STATE THAT DIES.

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:45.843
THIS TYPE OF A PROGRAM.

00:35:45.910 --> 00:35:47.678
IT'S TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THAT

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:49.313
MAKING SURE THAT THOSE PROCESSES

00:35:49.380 --> 00:35:51.582

NOW WITHIN THE FISCAL SYSTEM.

00:35:54.118 --> 00:35:55.486
AND SO THAT'S A LOT THAT'S WHY

00:35:55.553 --> 00:35:58.356
AGAIN THESE RESOURCES ARE NOT.

00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:01.092
FOR MORE SYSTEM WORK IN MORE IN

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.159
YOU KNOW DEVELOPING MILESTONES

00:36:02.226 --> 00:36:03.828
IT REALLY IS DEVELOPING THE

00:36:03.895 --> 00:36:05.263
PEOPLE HAVING A BETTER

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:07.798
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY ARE

00:36:07.865 --> 00:36:08.900
DEPARTMENTS STRUGGLING IN

00:42:37.721 --> 00:42:40.991
SO WHAT REALLY REMAINS IS THE

00:42:41.058 --> 00:42:42.793
CASH BOOK OF RECORDS.

00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:44.862

00:43:04.315 --> 00:43:05.849
TESTING ON THE NEW FUNCTIONALITY

00:43:05.916 --> 00:43:07.284

MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE

00:43:16.961 --> 00:43:18.762
SYSTEM THE OTHER THING THAT IS

00:43:18.829 --> 00:43:20.230
BEEN AN INCREDIBLE SUCCESS.

00:43:20.297 --> 00:43:22.533
FOR THE FISCAL SYSTEM THAT -- IS

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:24.201
I BELIEVE CHANGING A LOT OF THE

00:43:24.268 --> 00:43:25.769
DIALOGUE ON HOW WE WILL BE ABLE

00:43:25.836 --> 00:43:26.704
TO TALK ABOUT.

00:43:26.770 --> 00:43:27.571
FINANCE FOR THE STATE OF

00:43:27.638 --> 00:43:28.939
CALIFORNIA IS OUR TRANSPARENCY

00:43:29.006 --> 00:43:30.708
WEBSITE.

NOT A 100% OF THE DEPARTMENT'S

00:43:41.151 --> 00:43:42.119
YET BECAUSE THE SIXTY FOUR

00:43:42.186 --> 00:43:43.354
AREN'T OP THAT JUST CAME ON IN

00:43:43.420 --> 00:43:44.788
JULY.

00:43:44.855 --> 00:43:46.256
BUT I BELIEVE I'VE GOT EIGHTY

00:43:46.323 --> 00:43:47.124
EIGHT THE BULK OF EIGHTY EIGHT

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:49.159
DEPARTMENTS -- UP.

00:43:49.226 --> 00:43:50.594
ON THERE ALREADY WE WILL

00:43:50.661 --> 00:43:53.063
CONTINUE TO BRING ON THE

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:55.866
REMAINING DEPARTMENTS THE TARGET

00:43:55.933 --> 00:43:57.101
IS THE SUMMER THIS SUMMER.

00:43:57.167 --> 00:43:58.569
AND THEN YOU WILL BE ABLE TO AN

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:00.270
ANYBODY AGAIN CAN UTILIZE THIS

00:44:00.337 --> 00:44:01.505
INFORMATION THEY CAN DOWNLOAD

00:44:01.572 --> 00:44:02.906
THE DATA THAT THEY CAN SLICE IT

00:44:02.973 --> 00:44:04.208
AND DICE IT THE WAY THAT THEY

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:05.376
SEE FIT.

00:44:05.442 --> 00:44:07.211
BUT THIS IS HUGE HUGE

00:44:07.277 --> 00:44:08.746
IMPROVEMENTS.

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:09.780
IN BOTH TRANSPARENCY FOR THE

00:44:09.847 --> 00:44:11.682
STATE OF CALIFORNIA BUT IN THE

00:44:11.749 --> 00:44:13.984
ABILITY TO BETTER MANAGE FOR OUR

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:15.652

THE LEGISLATURE.

00:44:20.157 --> 00:44:26.296

00:44:26.363 --> 00:44:28.198
TECHNOLOGY THE WAY THAT YOU DO

00:44:28.265 --> 00:44:30.100
BUT MY SENSE IS THAT.

00:44:30.167 --> 00:44:33.103
THIS IS A REALLY GREAT MORE

00:44:33.170 --> 00:44:34.505
SOPHISTICATED.

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:36.440
PROGRAM.

00:44:36.507 --> 00:44:38.108
BUT THE DOWNSIDE HAS BEEN.

00:44:38.175 --> 00:44:40.244
THAT -- THE DIFFERENT

00:44:40.310 --> 00:44:43.213
DEPARTMENTS WERE NOT PREPARED

00:44:55.192 --> 00:44:56.527
YOU KNOW DO YOU DO YOU HAVE ANY

00:44:56.593 --> 00:44:58.996

THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED. TO

00:45:00.931 --> 00:45:02.866
OPERATE FISCAL.

00:45:02.933 --> 00:45:04.568

00:45:04.635 --> 00:45:06.003
FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS THIS

00:45:06.070 --> 00:45:08.072

00:46:02.059 --> 00:46:03.160
USING PEOPLE SAW.

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:04.328

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:13.704
MANAGEMENT PART.

00:46:13.770 --> 00:46:14.905
BUT WHEN YOU'RE COMING IN

00:46:14.972 --> 00:46:15.606
WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING OF THE

00:46:15.672 --> 00:46:17.474
SYSTEM WE NOW ARE WE HAVE

00:46:17.541 --> 00:46:18.976
EVIDENCE THAT WOULD INDICATE

00:46:19.042 --> 00:46:21.245
THAT THE SYSTEM.

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:23.347
DOES IN FACT.

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:26.250
DO YOU SIR CAN PRODUCE -- FASTER

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:29.119

STRUGGLES AT SOME OF SOME OF OUR

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.292
CURRENT STATE STAFF HOUSE.

00:46:35.359 --> 00:46:37.594
AND THIS IS A HUGE MORE THAN AN

00:46:37.661 --> 00:46:42.099
I. T. IMPLEMENTATION THIS HIS.

00:46:42.166 --> 00:46:43.467
LIGHT I I CAN'T STE STRONGLY

00:46:43.534 --> 00:46:44.034
SAVE ENOUGH THAT WE

00:46:44.101 --> 00:46:46.036
FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE WAY

00:46:46.103 --> 00:46:46.603
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE DO

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:47.504
THEIR JOBS.

00:46:47.571 --> 00:46:49.273
EVERY SINGLE DAY WHAT THEY DO

00:46:49.339 --> 00:46:51.775
COMING AND WE'RE CHANGING HOW

00:46:51.842 --> 00:46:54.912
THEY GO ABOUT DOING IT.

00:46:54.978 --> 00:46:58.182

WHAT THE PROJECT IS TODAY.

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:06.390
I WILL NOTE FOR THAT THE

00:47:06.456 --> 00:47:07.958
COMMITTEE THAT WE DO HAVE NINE

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:09.359
DEPARTMENTS THAT ARE DEFERRED

00:47:09.426 --> 00:47:11.261
CURRENTLY FROM BEING INCLUDED IN

00:47:11.328 --> 00:47:12.529
THE SYSTEM.

00:47:12.596 --> 00:47:14.765
WHEN THOSE DEPARTMENTS DO COME

00:47:14.831 --> 00:47:16.500
ON WHEN THERE'S THE USEFUL LIFE

00:47:16.567 --> 00:47:19.069
OF THEIR SYSTEMS COME TO AN END

00:47:19.136 --> 00:47:20.504
AND THEY LOOK TO TRANSITION? TO

00:47:20.571 --> 00:47:23.974
TO THE FISCAL SYSTEM I DON'T

00:47:24.041 --> 00:47:26.076
HAVE A CHRIS.

00:47:26.143 --> 00:47:27.778
VENTURE A GUESS THAT I WOULD

00:47:27.844 --> 00:47:28.312
NEED TO COME BACK TO THE

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:29.413
LEGISLATURE FOR ADDITIONAL

00:47:29.479 --> 00:47:31.548
RESOURCES FOR THE ON BOARDING

00:47:31.615 --> 00:47:33.183
THE CONFIGURATION AND THAT THE

00:47:33.250 --> 00:47:33.951
TRANSITION OF THESE BECAUSE

00:47:34.017 --> 00:47:35.452
THESE ARE BIG DEPARTMENTS.

00:47:35.519 --> 00:47:38.455
CALTRANS CDC OUR WATER RESOURCES

00:47:38.522 --> 00:47:41.058
THE ON THE YOUR SOME OF THAT.

00:47:41.124 --> 00:47:42.326
SOME OF THE LARGER --

00:47:42.392 --> 00:47:45.095
DEPARTMENTS SO WE CAN EXPECT A

00:47:45.162 --> 00:47:47.264
REQUEST FOR RESOURCES TO COVER

00:47:47.331 --> 00:47:49.466
THOSE NINE ADDITIONAL READY PART

00:47:49.533 --> 00:47:50.934
FOR THE ON BOARDING PASS AND

00:47:51.001 --> 00:47:52.336
THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S

00:47:52.402 --> 00:47:54.304
BEEN A LITTLE BIT CONFUSING TO

00:47:54.371 --> 00:47:55.072
ME IS.

00:47:55.138 --> 00:47:57.174
THERE'S RESOURCES TO FISCALE BUT

00:47:57.241 --> 00:47:58.242
THEN THERE'S INDIVIDUAL

00:47:58.308 --> 00:48:00.978
DEPARTMENTS THAT ALSO COME TO US

00:48:01.044 --> 00:48:03.814
REQUESTING MONEY TO STAFF UP

00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:08.352
RIGHT -- SO DO YOU EXPECT.

00:48:08.418 --> 00:48:09.853
THAT WE WOULD ALSO HEAR FROM.

00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:10.787
EITHER OF DEPARTMENTS ARE

00:48:10.854 --> 00:48:13.023
ALREADY ON BOARD OR THE NINE

00:48:13.090 --> 00:48:14.725
ADDITIONAL DEPARTMENTS THAT THEY

00:48:14.791 --> 00:48:17.227
WILL ALSO COME INDIVIDUALLY. TO

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:20.664
ASK FOR RESOURCES.

00:48:20.731 --> 00:48:23.300
TO CARRY OUT THE FISCAL.

00:48:23.367 --> 00:48:24.835
I HAVE IMPLEMENT YEAH I'D HAVE

00:48:24.901 --> 00:48:27.070
TO DEFER TO TO THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:48:27.137 --> 00:48:28.138
FINANCE FOR THAT.

00:48:28.205 --> 00:48:29.640
BUT GENERALLY SPEAKING THE

00:48:29.706 --> 00:48:31.208
RESOURCES THAT WE ARE ASKING FOR

00:48:31.275 --> 00:48:32.876
ARCH SUPPORT THAT THE STATEWIDE

00:48:32.943 --> 00:48:33.610
SYSTEM.

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:36.680
AND WHAT I HEARD FROM.

00:48:36.747 --> 00:48:38.949
HAVE LIKE IF TO BE.

00:48:39.016 --> 00:48:39.583
IN READING SOME OF THE OTHER BE

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.051
CITIES IT APPEARS THAT THEY'RE

00:48:41.118 --> 00:48:43.487
LOOKING -- FOR RESOURCES THAT

00:48:43.553 --> 00:48:45.289
WILL ENABLE THEM TO DEAL WITH

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:48.292
THE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD THAT IS --

00:48:48.358 --> 00:48:49.760
IN SOME CASES REQUIRED.

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:52.396
IN THAT IN THE SYSTEM ONE OF THE

00:48:52.462 --> 00:48:54.031
KEY ONES IS SMALL TO SMALL

00:48:54.097 --> 00:48:56.700
MEDIUM DEPARTMENTS -- WILL HAVE

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.502
VERY SMALL ACCOUNTING SHOPS AND

00:48:58.568 --> 00:49:00.404
AS A RESULT.

00:49:00.470 --> 00:49:01.271
FISKE OUT NOW IT'S NOT A NEW

00:49:01.338 --> 00:49:02.639
REQUIREMENT BUT FIST CALLIN

00:49:02.706 --> 00:49:04.841
FORCES YOUR SEPARATION OF DUTIES

00:49:04.908 --> 00:49:06.710
SO I CANNOT GO IN AND PUT IN A

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:09.246
REQUISITION AND BUY SOMETHING.

00:49:09.313 --> 00:49:10.480
AND THEN ALSO BE THE APPROVER.

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:11.715
THERE NEEDSTO BE A SEPARATE

00:49:11.782 --> 00:49:13.517
BODIES TO BE ABLE TO DO PROPER

00:49:13.583 --> 00:49:14.284
ACCOUNTING.

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.086
I SAW SOME OF THEM.

00:49:16.153 --> 00:49:17.521
ALL DEPARTMENTS ARE ASKING FOR

00:49:17.587 --> 00:49:19.556
RESOURCES FOR THAT TYPE OF THING

00:49:19.623 --> 00:49:21.158
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY I

00:49:21.224 --> 00:49:22.459
CAN'T SPEAK TO IT.

00:49:22.526 --> 00:49:25.262
THE CONDITION OF THE ACCOUNTING

00:49:25.329 --> 00:49:25.796
OFFICE IS A AND THE OTHER

00:49:25.862 --> 00:49:27.731
DEPARTMENTS.

00:49:27.798 --> 00:49:29.466
A SO WE EVALUATE REQUESTS FROM

00:49:29.533 --> 00:49:30.667
APARTMENTS RELATED DEFENSE GODS

00:49:30.734 --> 00:49:32.903
ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AND IF

00:49:32.969 --> 00:49:34.304
THEY HAVE A UNIQUE SITUATION

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:36.173
THAT DOES REQUIRE MORE RESOURCES

00:49:36.239 --> 00:49:38.709
WE RECOMMEND THOSE FOR APPROVAL --

00:49:38.775 --> 00:49:41.244
BUT WE WE CAN'T REALLY PROJECT

00:49:41.311 --> 00:49:43.347
OUT THAT WE KNOW TODAY THAT

00:49:43.413 --> 00:49:44.281
THEY'RE GONNA BE ANY DEPARTMENTS

00:49:44.348 --> 00:49:47.284
ARE WE GONNA BE COMING FORWARD

00:49:47.351 --> 00:49:48.318
IN FUTURE YEARS.

00:49:48.385 --> 00:49:50.620
MORE RESOURCES RELATED TO FRISCO --

00:49:50.687 --> 00:49:51.555
AND RELATED TO THE REPORTING

00:49:51.621 --> 00:49:53.523
THAT ELLIE I MENTIONED EARLIER --

00:49:53.590 --> 00:49:54.024
THERE IS A SUPPLEMENTAL

00:49:54.091 --> 00:49:56.159
REPORTING REQUIREMENTS AS PART

00:49:56.226 --> 00:49:57.327
OF THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINTEEN

00:49:57.394 --> 00:49:57.627
BUDGET ACT.

00:49:57.694 --> 00:49:59.930
THAT DOES REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT

00:49:59.996 --> 00:50:01.398
OF FINANCE.

00:50:01.465 --> 00:50:02.532
TO REPORT ON OTHER COSTS THAT

00:50:02.599 --> 00:50:04.468
HAVE BEEN REQUESTED RELATED TO

00:50:04.534 --> 00:50:06.870
FIX GAL OUTSIDE OF THE SCOUTS

00:50:06.937 --> 00:50:08.405
BUT SO THAT INFORMATION IS GOING

00:50:08.472 --> 00:50:09.973
TO BE COLLECTED AFTER THE AFTER

00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:11.842
THE PROJECT IT IS IS OVER AND WE

00:50:11.908 --> 00:50:12.008
CAN.

00:50:12.075 --> 00:50:15.178
ACTUALLY GET A FULL.

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:15.612
THE HOTEL.

00:50:15.679 --> 00:50:18.048
WHEN IS THAT -- IT'S GONNA BE

00:50:18.115 --> 00:50:19.449
THAT THE THE PROPOSAL WAS FOR

00:50:19.516 --> 00:50:21.651
THAT THAT WILL BE COMPLETED IN.

00:50:21.718 --> 00:50:24.054
NINETEEN TWENTY SO IN.

00:50:24.121 --> 00:50:25.455
TWENTY IS WHEN WE CAN HEAR THAT

00:50:25.522 --> 00:50:27.924
BUT THAT WILL BE AFTER IT'S ALL.

00:50:27.991 --> 00:50:30.293
YES BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO THE

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:30.927
BILL THE REQUIREMENT IS THAT WE

00:50:30.994 --> 00:50:32.396
WE PROVIDE ALL OF THE

00:50:32.462 --> 00:50:33.463
INFORMATION AND I CAN PROVIDE

00:50:33.530 --> 00:50:34.664
ALL OF WE CAN PROVIDE ALL THE

00:50:34.731 --> 00:50:36.500
INFORMATION UNTIL THE PROJECT IS.

00:50:36.566 --> 00:50:38.869
COMPLETE [inaudible]

00:50:38.935 --> 00:50:40.537
YES.

00:50:40.604 --> 00:50:43.473
JUST TO CLARIFY THAT -- THE THE

00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:44.608
SUPPLEMENT REPORTING LANGUAGE

00:50:44.674 --> 00:50:46.977
THAT -- FINANCES REFERRING TO

00:50:47.043 --> 00:50:48.678
DOES SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS

00:50:48.745 --> 00:50:49.880
ADDITIONAL COSTS RELATED TO THE

00:50:49.946 --> 00:50:53.583
INTEGRATED SOLUTION I BELIEVE

00:50:53.650 --> 00:50:54.751
COSTS FOR DEPARTMENTS TO

00:50:54.818 --> 00:50:56.219
TRANSACT IN FISCAL.

00:50:56.286 --> 00:50:58.188
WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S FINANCES

00:50:58.255 --> 00:51:00.457
APPROACH TO TO DOING THIS IS TO

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.025
LET THE PROJECT INTER KIND OF

00:51:02.092 --> 00:51:02.993
THE MAINTENANCE AND OPERATIONS

00:51:03.059 --> 00:51:04.728
PHASE AND THEN START AGGREGATING

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:05.862
THOSE NUMBERS.

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:07.230
IS IS DIFFERENT FROM WHAT THE

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:08.965
ART LANGUAGE ACTUALLY SAYS SO IF

00:51:09.032 --> 00:51:10.400
THE LEGISLATURE WOULD LIKE TO

00:51:10.467 --> 00:51:12.869
CLARIFY THAT IN SUPPLEMENT

00:51:12.936 --> 00:51:17.808
REPORTING LANGUAGE COULD DO SO.

00:51:17.874 --> 00:51:20.277
ACTION ITEM TO WRESTLE WITH THE

00:51:20.343 --> 00:51:21.578
HOST OF WE DO GET SOMETHING

00:51:21.645 --> 00:51:24.981
CLEAR -- UNIT. TOO MUCH IS TOO

00:51:25.048 --> 00:51:27.317
VAGUE. FOR ME TO GET MY HANDS ON

00:51:27.384 --> 00:51:29.052
IT RIGHT NOW [inaudible]

00:51:29.119 --> 00:51:30.120
YEAH.

00:51:30.187 --> 00:51:32.422
YEAH I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE

00:51:32.489 --> 00:51:34.124
THE ON GOING IF IT WAS ALL

00:51:34.191 --> 00:51:36.760
COMING THROUGH FISCAL SAYING.

00:51:36.827 --> 00:51:38.528
THIS IS WHAT WE NEED THIS IS HOW

00:51:38.595 --> 00:51:39.095
EVERY DAY.

00:51:39.162 --> 00:51:40.464
BUT EVERY DEPARTMENT NEEDS WITH

00:51:40.530 --> 00:51:42.098
THE RESOURCES ARE THEY GOING TO

00:51:42.165 --> 00:51:42.933
BE NEEDED.

00:51:42.999 --> 00:51:44.034
WHETHER IT'S TRAINING THE

00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.303
DEPARTMENT STAFF FOR YOUR

00:51:46.369 --> 00:51:49.439
OVERSIGHT OR YOU KNOW.

00:51:49.506 --> 00:51:50.373
RESOURCES FOR YOUR ROLE.

00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:53.543
IT JUST SEEMS TO BE COMING IN.

00:51:53.610 --> 00:51:54.311
ADDISON DIFFERENT.

00:51:54.377 --> 00:51:55.679
FROM DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS AT

00:51:55.745 --> 00:51:58.415
DIFFERENT TIMES RATHER THAN.

00:51:58.482 --> 00:52:01.117
HERE'S HERE'S THE TOTAL PICTURE.

00:52:01.184 --> 00:52:03.920
AND THIS IS HOW WE AIM TO MAKE

00:52:03.987 --> 00:52:06.022
SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS THE

00:52:06.089 --> 00:52:07.491
RESOURCES THEY NEED TO IMPLEMENT

00:52:07.557 --> 00:52:10.427
AND I THINK THAT'S AS PART OF MY

00:52:10.494 --> 00:52:12.295
SORT OF FRUSTRATION.

00:52:12.362 --> 00:52:14.030
AND WANTING TO BE HELPFUL.

00:52:14.097 --> 00:52:15.632

TO SAY YES THIS IS.

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:26.276
THIS IS SOMETHING WE NEED AND

00:52:26.343 --> 00:52:27.644
AFTER ALL THESE DEPARTMENTS THAT

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:29.145
HAVE -- COME ON BOARD SEEMS TO

00:52:29.212 --> 00:52:30.947
