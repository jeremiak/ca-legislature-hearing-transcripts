MATHIS SURGERY BLEACH FRIEDMAN HAD OCCURRED. ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTY SIX BY THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AN ACT RELATING TO EDUCATION FINANCE AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. SKINNER SKINNER FOURS ARE YOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH- MEMBERS BY. VERY HONORED TO PRESENT TO YOU AB EIGHTY SIX WHICH IS AN EDUCATION TRAILER BILL SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL REPRESENTS A IN AGREEMENTS BETWEEN BOTH HOUSES OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE A PATH TO RETURN TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AT OUR SCHOOLS AND TO GET OUR CHILDREN BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. IT EMPHASIZES THE SAFETY FOR STUDENTS AND STAFF. WHICH MEANS THEN IT'S RICH IT'S RECOGNIZING OR EMPHASIZING THE SAFETY OF OUR COMMUNITIES SINCE OUR CHILDREN AND STAFF. MOVE IN AND OUT OF THOSE COMMUNITIES IF THEY'RE GOING TO SCHOOL AND WE KNOW THAT STOPPING THE SPREAD OF THIS VIRUS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE CAN DO RIGHT NOW. SO IT EMPHASIZES THAT SAFETY AND IT RESPECTS THE DIFFERING LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES ACROSS THE STATE PROVIDING KEY FLEXIBILITY TO HELP OUR CLASSROOMS GET BACK OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IT PROVIDES SIX POINT SIX BILLION TO HELP OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS COVER THE COSTS OF REOPENING SAFELY WHICH OF SUCH THINGS LIKE TESTING. AND DIFFERENT PHYSICAL CHANGES IN ORDER TO HAVE THE APPROPRIATE DISTANCE AND SUCH AND IT ALSO WITHIN THAT SIX POINT SIX BILLION. ALLOWS THE DISTRICTS TO SPEND MONEY ON SUPPLEMENTAL INSTRUCTION AND SUPPORTS AN UP THAT TOTAL TWO BILLION. IS SPECIFICALLY FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANTS FOR THE TO SUPPORT ANY. SPECIFIC COSTS RELATED TO THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AND VARIOUS SAFETY PROTOCOLS ARE DELINEATED IN THE BILL BASED ON THE TEARS OF THE COUNTY AN ADDITIONAL FOUR POINT SIX BILLION IN EXPANDED LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES GRANTS IS PROVIDED FOR ALL DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE EXPANDED LEARNING TIME AND ACTED MAKE INTERVENTIONS THROUGH. BUT NOT LIMITED TO SUMMER SCHOOL EXTENDED YEAR EXTENDED INSTRUCTIONAL TIME ONE ON ONE TUTORING AND OTHER IN PERSON SERVICES. THE BILL ALSO PUTS IN THE STATUTE THE GOVERNOR'S ANNOUNCEMENT THAT COMMENCING MARCH FIRST JUST A FEW DAYS AGO. THAT SCHOOL STAFF AARON CHILD CARE PROVIDERS WILL BE PRIORITIZED FOR VACCINES IN TIER ONE B. STATEWIDE. AND THAT WE RECEIVE WILL BE OFFERED TO K. TWELVE EDUCATORS AND KATIE. EDUCATORS STAFF AND CHILD CARE PROVIDERS BUT IT DOES NOT AND I WILL BE CLEAR ABOUT THIS MAKE VACCINATION A PRE REQUISITE FOR BEGINNING IN PERSONS INSTRUCTION. THE BILL ALSO TEMPORARILY WAIVES THE REQUIREMENT THAT HOME SCHOOLED STUDENTS SUBMIT STANDARDIZED TEST RESULTS WHICH WERE DISRUPTED DUE TO THE CORVETTE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. ALLOWING THE STUDENTS ACCESS TO CAL GRANTS TO HELP PAY FOR COLLEGE THE BILL ALSO. IF THE DISTRICT OR SCHOOL HAS ALREADY REOPENED IT DOES NOT IMPOSE NEW RESTRICTIONS OR RULES ON THAT SCHOOL IN ANY SCHOOL THAT ALREADY HAS ITS FULL RE OPENING PLAN. AND IS INTENDING TO REOPEN PRIOR OR RATHER I DON'T SHE RE OPEN OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN OPENED RATHER RETURNING TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IF THEY ALREADY HAVE A PLAN FOR THE WEEK RETURNED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND INTEND TO DO SO BEFORE THE DATE SPECIFIED IN THIS BILL. THEN THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE BILL ARE NOT IMPOSED ON THOSE DISTRICTS. AB EIGHTY SIX WAS HEARD BY OUR SENATE BUDGET COMMITTEE ON TUESDAY. SENATE PASSED THE COMMITTEE WITH A UNANIMOUS VOTE WITH ALL MEMBERS PRESENT. IN WITH THAT MEMBERS I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER SKINNER CENTER JONES FOR WHAT PURPOSE. MISTER PRESIDENT RISE WITH AMENDMENTS AT THE DESK FOR AB EIGHTY SIX. FROM SECRETARY PLEASE READ THE MEMBERS. AMENDMENTS BY SENATOR JONES SET. ONE GENERAL JONES THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BODY FOR AB EIGHTY SIX I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF MY COLLEAGUES TO IMPROVE ON THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THIS BILL. BUT THE REALITY IS THAT IT STILL DOES NOT GO QUITE FAR ENOUGH THE BILL IN CHIEF DOES PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RE OPEN BUT IT FAILED TO PROVIDE WHAT HEALTH EXPERTS RECOMMEND AND WE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS DESPERATELY NEED A GUARANTEED OPTION TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM IMMEDIATELY. THIS AMENDMENT WOULD ACCOMPLISH THAT GOAL BY DOING THE FOLLOWING FIRST IT WOULD REQUIRE EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA TO OPERATE STUDENTS AT ALL GRADE LEVELS THE OPTION OF A FIVE DAY WORK WEEK INSTRUCTIONAL MODEL. INTO IT WOULD GIVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED TO MEET SOCIAL DISTANCING REQUIREMENTS TO THE GREATEST EXTENT PRACTICABLE IN ORDER TO BRING KIDS BACK TO THE CLASSROOM. NOTHING IN THIS AMENDMENT WOULD PROHIBIT DISTRICTS FROM CONTINUING TO OFFER A DISTANCE LEARNING OPTION TO FAMILIES BUT IT WOULD PROVIDE RELIEF TO THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. THAT NEED TO BE BACK IN SCHOOL. MANY OF YOU IN THIS ROOM ARE PARENTS JUST LIKE I AM AND YOU UNDERSTAND HOW CRITICAL EDUCATION IS TO A CHILD'S SOCIAL AND ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT AT ALL AGES. THIS PAST YEAR HAS BEEN DEVASTATING FOR THE MENTAL HEALTH. AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES OF STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. AS OF TODAY CALIFORNIA RANKS FORTY NINE OUT OF FIFTY STATES IN GETTING KIDS BACK TO THE CLASSROOM ACCORDING TO RECENT ANALYSIS IS. AB EIGHTY SIX TAKES A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT WE OWE IT TO THE FAMILIES AND THE STUDENTS TO DO MORE. SURELY MY DEMOCRAT COLLEAGUES DON'T WANT TO IGNORE THE ADVICE OF CDC AND THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION THAT SCHOOLS. ARE THE SAFEST PLACE FOR CHILDREN. TEACHERS AND STAFF TO BE. WE CAN DO BETTER FOR CALIFORNIA WE CAN MAKE THIS BETTER. BILL WE CAN MAKE THIS A BILL A BETTER BILL COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON THESE AMENDMENTS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE EVERY CHILD IN CALIFORNIA. HAS ACCESS TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WITHOUT FURTHER DELAY.

PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES ON BEHALF OF MY WIFE AND I. I'M JUST SO THANKFUL THIS BILLS MOVIN FORWARD. I GOT TWO LITTLE BOYS BOTH OF WHOM WERE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL AND IT IS BEING A YEAR ALMOST THAT THEY'VE BEEN OUT OF SCHOOL I KNOW A LOT OF YOU. UNDERSTAND THIS HAVING CHILDREN OF YOUR OWN OR GRANDCHILDREN. THIS IS A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. CAN I GET TELL YOU DESPITE BEING AN EDUCATOR FOR WELL OVER A DECADE. I THOUGHT IT WAS A PRETTY GOOD PROFESSOR. AND THEN I WAS ASKED TO TEACH MY TWO BOYS MATH AT THE ELEMENTARY LEVEL I REALIZED HOW CRUMMY A TEACHER I REALLY HELPING. I COULD EVEN FIGURE THAT ACTUALLY HELD THEIRDOING IT THESE DAYS BUT ANYWAYS THIS IS JUST A HUGE STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION I'M EVEN THOUGH WE HAD- SOME HOSTILE AMENDMENTS- TO TRY TO MAKE THIS- PIECE LEGISLATION MORE PALATABLE THIS IS DEFINITELY WHAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS AND ON. COULD BE VERY THANKFUL TO BE SUPPORTING IT. THANK YOU CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS A PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTY SIX AND I REALLY WANT TO THANK OUR LEADERSHIP AND THE LEADERSHIP OF THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR- AND- OUR SERVER EDUCATION COMMITTEE THAT SERVER BUDGET COMMITTEE AND OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THIS IS AN AMAZING. TEAM EFFORT WORKING WITH A BROADER ARRAY OF SOMETIMES WARRING STAKEHOLDERS- TO COME UP WITH LEGISLATION- THAT IS A MAJOR STEP FORWARD AND THAT'S IT COMMUNICATES ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT THE STATE IS HERE TO SUPPORT YOU TO PROVIDE YOU WITH A FUNDING THAT% YOU NEED TO RE OPEN TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE VACCINES- THAT WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT OUR TEACHERS AND OUR EDUCATION STAFF- CAN BE AS SAFE AS POSSIBLE. AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO DO WHAT'S NECESSARY NECESSARY TO PARTNER WITH AND SUPPORT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AS THEY MOVE TOWARDS RE OPENING SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE WHO MADE THIS A REALITY. RIGHT NOW- YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME WHO HAVE SAID WELL WE SHOULD MANDATE RE OPENING WE KNOW THAT ALL OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTSARE DIFFERENT AND MIGHT HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS BUT THERE IS ONE COMMON NEED THE SCHOOLS NEED TO REOPEN. AND NOW WE HAVE DONE THIS WE ARE PASSING THIS TODAY IT IS NOW UP TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TAKE THE STEPS THAT THEY NEED TO DEPLOY THESE RESOURCES TO DEPLOY THE VACCINES AND TO GET THE SCHOOLS REOPEN QUICKLY IS HARD TO OVERSTATE THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE AND IS BEING INFLICTED ON OUR CHILDREN ON. OUR STATE'S CHILDREN OUR FUTURE. BY NOT HAVING AN- LEARNING. THE HARM TO THE MENTAL HEALTH AND THE PHYSICAL HEALTH AND THE SOCIAL- DEVELOPMENT AND EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT OF THESE KIDS THE NUMBER OF KIDS WHO HAVE DISAPPEARED ENTIRELY. SINCE REMOTE LEARNINGS STARTED. IS JUST STARTLING AND UNACCEPTABLE. AND WE NEED TO GET THE SCHOOLS RE OPEN. AND I KNOW IT'S HARD BUT TODAY WE ARE PROVIDING POWERFUL TOOLS. FOR SCHOOLS TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION. I ALSO TO DO WANT TO COMMENT SPECIFICALLY COLLEAGUES. ON MY OWN HOME CITY- SPECIFICALLY THE SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. WAS EDUCATES OVER FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS. IN SAN FRANCISCO SINCE LAST FALL NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND PRIVATE SCHOOL STUDENTS HAVE BEEN IN SCHOOL NEARLY TWENTY THOUSAND SO FOR THE FAMILIES THAT ARE ABLE TO AFFORD TO PAY FOR PRIVATE EDUCATION SOME OF WHOM HAVE WALKED HAVE VOTED WITH THEIR FEET BY LEAVING THE SCHOOLS AND PUTTING THEIR KIDS IN PRIVATE SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY WERE SO DEEPLY FRUSTRATED WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS LACK OF PROGRESS TOWARDS RE OPENING. THOSE KIDS GOOD EDUCATION ALL THIS DOES IS EXACERBATE THE EXISTING EDUCATIONAL INEQUITIES. IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND IN SAN FRANCISCO IN PARTICULAR. AND SO I WANT TO URGE AND SAN FRANCISCO UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ACCEPT THIS FUNDING THE INITIAL SIGNAL FROM OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS NOT EVEN TO ACCEPT THE FUNDING. TO ACCEPT TO RE OPEN TO GET OUR KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL TO GET THE TEACHERS VACCINATED AND TO MOVE FORWARD ON IT A NOT. WITH THESE KIDS LANGUISHING AT HOME IT'S NOT FAIR AND IT IS DESTRUCTIVE TO THE LONG TERM HEALTH OF OUR STATE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT TODAY OUR RIGHTS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE BUT BEFORE I MOVE FORWARD I JUST WANTED TO SHARE SOME OF THE ISSUES FACING OUR PARENTS AT HOME AND THIS IS SUCH A PERSONAL ISSUE TO PARENTS AS STUDENTS ARE SOMEONE'S BABY SO I RUN INTO FAMILIES WHOARE CRYING AND PLEADING FOR US TO OPEN SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN ARE FALLING SO FAR BEHIND AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO GET THEM HELP. AND ON THE OTHER HAND I WANTED TO PARENTS WHO ARE TELLING ME THEY'RE KEEPING THEIR STUDENTS AT HOME AND ARE GETTING THEM TO THERE'S SO CLEAR THERE IS. SOME DEFICIENCIES AS A PERTAINS TO PROVIDING INCOME FAMILIES THAT SUPPORT TO CONTINUE TO HELP THEIR STUDENTS AT HOME. SO I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE PRO TEM LEADERSHIP. AND MY COLLEAGUES WHO WORK SO HARD ON THIS BILL. THIS IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT MEASURE. AND I KNOW FIRST HAND THAT THEY WORK TIRELESSLY. TO BE THOUGHTFUL. TO TAKE EVERYONE'S INPUT INTO CONSIDERATION. TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE SAFE OUR TEACHERS ARE SAFE OUR ADMINISTRATION. FAITH IN OUR ENTIRE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. I KNOW THAT MANY WILL SAY THIS IS NOT A GREAT SOLUTION. BUT IT IS A GOOD STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. AND AS OF THE ONLY TEACHER BOB WAS CURRENTLY ON LEAVE AND I MY FELLOW TEACHERS WHO PREVIOUSLY TAUGHT. WE UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS FIRSTHAND WE DO BUT IT IS PROJECTED THAT STUDENTS WILL FALL BEHIND. NINE MONTHS THAT IS AN ENTIRE ACADEMIC HERE. AND I ALSO KNOW THE TEACHER THAT THEY GAP WILL ONLY GROW EXPONENTIALLY AND WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO CATCH UP. OUR STUDENTS SO I ASK ALL OF US TO JUST CONSIDER. WHAT THIS BILL DOES. A GIVE SCHOOLS THE ABILITY TO TAKE WHAT WE OFFER. AN OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY. IT DOES GIVE FLEXIBILITY WHICH I THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT FOR SOME OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. AND I WILL SHARE THERE'S A LOT OF- SUPERINTEND. OVER TENANTS THAT I MET WITH RECENTLY SCHOOL TEACHERS PARENTS. THAT YOU CAN SEE EVERYONE'S DIVIDED ON THE ISSUE BUT THIS IS AS GOOD AS FIFTY IN THIS MOMENT. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PUT THE FUNDING FOR TIME SURE EVERYONE'S SAFE. BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS CONVERSATION SHOULD NOT STOP HERE. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR. AND ADVOCATE FOR MORE SUPPORT. AND WITH THAT. I ASTRONOMICAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR WILK. THANK YOU MISTER. ON MARCH SIXTH OF TWENTY TWENTY THIS GAVE EMERGE POWER TO GOVERN NEWSOM WITH THE STROKE OF A PEN HE BLUDGEONED SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEIR EMPLOYEES CREATING AN UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DOUBLE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE IN THE GOVERNOR'S WREAK HAVOC ON CALIFORNIA'S NEXT GENERATION BY CLOSING OUR SCHOOLS. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT JUSTICE LEARNING HAS BEEN AN ABJECT FAILURE AND THAT LEARNING LOSS IS REAL HOW BAD. WE WON'T KNOW FOR YEARS. BUT IN ADDITION TO OUR CHILDREN SUFFERING INTELLECTUALLY THEY'VE STRUGGLED EMOTIONALLY AS WELL. THE NONPROFIT FAIR HEALTH WHICH COLLECTS DATA FROM PRIVATELY BUILD INSURANCE CLAIMS HAS RELEASED THE FOLLOWING DATA AND IT'S DEVASTATING NEWS FOR TEENAGERS THIRTEEN TO EIGHTEEN. CHANGES IN DATA FROM APRIL NINETEENTH TO APRIL TWENTY SHOW THE FOLLOWING DEPRESSION. 84% ANXIETY BUT 94% SELF HARM THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE PERCENT. AND OVERDOSES A 119% AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT'S MORE THAN JUST HARD COLD DATA THAT'S OUR MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE CALIFORNIA'S NEXT GENERATION AND OUR CHILDREN SHOULD GET EVERY POLICYMAKER PAS. THE TRUTH IS AB EIGHTY SIX DOESN'T DO ANYTHING TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS. I BELIEVE WITH OR WITHOUT THIS BILL SCHOOL DISTRICTS I WANNA REOPEN WILL. IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT DON'T WANT TO RE OPEN WON'T. SO IF THIS IS NOT A SCHOOL RE OPENING BILL WHAT IS IT. I BELIEVE IT'S A C. Y. A MANEUVER BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO GET PARENTS TO BELIEVE HE'S DOING EVERYTHING HE POSSIBLY CAN FOR THEM. SO THIS MORNING I WILL BE RELUCTANTLY VOTING FOR AB EIGHTY SIX. BECAUSE MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS NEED THE FUNDING TO MEET SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND OPEN SCHOOL SAFELY. I ALSO SALUTE ALL OF YOU WHO WORKED ON THIS BECAUSE I KNOW THIS IS THE BEST DEAL. THAT YOU COULD GET. BUT YOU KNOW THE TRUTH IS. THAT WE DON'T NEED A B. EIGHTY SIX. BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR HAS ABILITY HIMSELF TO PUT KIDS FIRST IN SIGNED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER RE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS. AND HE'S CHOSEN NOT TO DO SO HE'S CHOSEN TO HIDE BEHIND AB EIGHTY SIX. AND I HAVE SIMPLY WANTING TO SAY TO THE GOVERNOR MR NEWSHAM OPEN OUR SCHOOLS. THANK SENATOR WORKCENTRE MELINDA'S. I AM PLEASED THAT WE FINALLY HAVE A PLAN TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS ARE HAS BEEN ROLLED OUT BT FRANKLY THIS PLAN SHOULD HAVE BEEN ROLLED OUT. MONTHS AGO. I MEAN THE DAMAGE HAS ALREADY BEEN DONE AND I'M- I GUESS I'M A LITTLE SHOCKED TO HEAR. SO MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT THE DAMAGE THAT HAS BEEN DONE TO THE STUDENTS ONE WE'VE KNOWN THIS DAMAGE IS BEING DONE FOR MONTHS AND WEEKS NOW. IN OVER A YEAR. I HAVE A STUDENT IN MY DISTRICT- AND I LIKE TO SHARE HIS COMMENTS WITH YOU IF I MAY. HE SAYS MY NAME IS CAMERON FOR MACHINERY. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT MY APOLOGIES. MY NAME IS CAMERON SOUTHWICK IN NINETY AS BE PRESIDENT OF ELSINORE HIGH SCHOOL WELL TO MARK THIS PAST SEMESTER WAS ROUGH FOR MANY STUDENTS AT MY HIGH SCHOOL AND OTHER SCHOOLS ELSINORE HIGH SCHOOL 45% OF THE FRESHMAN CLASS HAD AT LEAST ONE HALF IN THE FIRST SEMESTER OF HIGH SCHOOL. IT WAS A HARD ADJUSTMENT FOR ME GOING FROM MIDDLE SCHOOL TO HIGH SCHOOL IN PERSON BACK IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE FOR THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FURTHERMORE THIS IS THEIR FIRST IMPRESSION OF HIGH SCHOOL WHAT ARE THEY TO EXPECT THE REST OF THEIR HIGH SCHOOL CAREERS TO BE. AS FOR UPPERCLASSMEN WE HAVE LOST OVER TWO HUNDRED CLASSMATES TO CONTINUATION SCHOOL PRIVATE SCHOOLS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND SIMPLY MOVING OUT OF STATE STUDENTS FROM OTHER HIGH SCHOOLS HAVE MENTIONED THAT SCHOOLS BECOME DIFFICULT TIRESOME AND MOTIVATIONAL TO AN EXTEND FAR BEYOND WHAT YOU MAY SEE. THE DEPRESSION RATE IS RISING FASTER THAN KEVIN NINETEEN SPREADS AND IT IS EXTREMELY UNHEALTHY FOR TEENAGERS TO BE TRAPPED IN THEIR ROOMS FOR LONG PERODS OF TIME. WE HAVE LOST ZERO STUDENTS IN OUR DISTRICT TO KEVIN NINETEEN HOWEVER SINCE THE PANDEMIC BEGAN WE HAVE LOST THREE STUDENTS TO SUICIDE. TO HAVE GOOD HEALTH WE NEED TO GET PHYSICAL MENTAL AND SOCIAL WELL BEING. SITTING ALL DAY WORKING ON SCHOOL WORK IN FRONT OF A COMPUTER WITH NO COMMUNICATION EXCEPT THREE DEVICE IS NOT HEALTHY IT IS MISERABLE. I SIT BACK AND WATCH THE PRIVATE CHARTER SCHOOLS GO TO SCHOOL IN PERSON. AND WONDER WHAT'S GOING ON. WHAT MAKES PUBLIC SCHOOLS ANY DIFFERENT WE BREATHE THE SAME AIR SHOP THE SAME STORES AND WALK ON THE SAME GROUND. SO MY QUESTION IS WHAT DO I TELL THE STUDENTS I REPRESENT WHO DESIRE TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL AS MUCH AS I DO. AND YOU ALSO. HAVE TO BE ON SAM INSTEAD OF SITTING AT A DESK WHAT IS THE JUSTIFIABLE DELAY. THIS IS JUST ONE OF MANY EMAILS THAT I RECEIVED FROM HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND I'M SURE. MANY OF YOU IN THE ROOM HAVE RECEIVED EMAILS LIKE THIS AS WELL. SO I HAVE TO AGREE. WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THE GOVERNOR COULD. GO BEYOND THIS BILL IN REQUIRING THAT THE SCHOOLS OPEN BECAUSE AS THIS BILL SITS RIGHT NOW IT DOESN'T. WE NOW REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO OPEN. BUT IF THEY DO OPEN THEY COULD THEY COULD HAVE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. ONE DAY A WEEK. THAT'S THAT'S HARDLY REALLY MUCH OF AN IMPROVEMENT THESE KIDS NEED TO BE BACK IN SCHOOL. I'VE I MEAN I'VE GOT THREE MY OWN IN HIGH SCHOOL I KNOW THERE'S AT LEAST PROBABLY HALF OF THIS BODY WHO HAS KIDS HOME AS WELL YOU'VE SEEN THE CHANGE THAT IS GOING ON IN THESE KIDS THIS. THIS BILL I APPRECIATE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT WENT INTO IT. BUT IT JUST DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH. MY FEAR IS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE KIDS GOING BACK TO ANY TYPE OF REAL- VALUABLE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. UNTIL NEXT YEAR. THAT'S TOO LATE SO I WILL REACH ME RELUCTANTLY VOTING FOR THIS BILL TODAY AS I DID IN COMMITTEE I WANTED TO MAKE MY COMMENTS KNOWN AND I WANTED TO SHARE WITH YOU HOW THESE KIDS ARE FEELING BECAUSE AS ADULTS IT'S BEEN AWHILE SINCE WE'VE BEEN IN SCHOOL BUT YOU REALLY NEED TO HEAR THE PAIN THAT THESE KIDS ARE GOING THROUGH. AND NOT BEING ABLE TO BE THEIR CLASSMATES IN B. AND AN IN PERSON ENVIRONMENT THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR LOCAL. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT ALL GOOD MORNING MEMBERS IT IS UNDISPUTED THAT OUR CHILDREN OF ANY AGE OUR STUDENTS OF ANY AGE IN PERSON WHAT IS DISPUTED IS HOW WE DO THAT HOW DO WE GET THEM BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM SETTING THIS IS MY FIRST PANDEMIC AS IT PROBABLY IS FOR ALL OF YOU AND THERE ARE NO EASY ANSWERS IN A PANDEMIC THIS IS AN INSIDIOUS DISEASE. AND THERE ARE NO EASY SOLUTIONS TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO WANT US TO MANDATE OPENING SCHOOLS I WOULD SAY TALK TO SOME OF YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WHEN I'VE TALKED TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THROUGH IN MY DISTRICT AND OUTSIDE THE DISTRICT THEY HAVE SURVEYED THEIR PARENTS BETWEEN FORTY AND SCIENTIFIC STUDY IT'S ANECDOTAL BUT FORTY BETWEEN FORTY AND 70% OF PARENTS SAY THEY ARE NOT GOING TO SEND THEIR STUDENTS BACK BUT THEY DO NOT FEEL SAFE SENDING THEIR PARENTS. OR STUDENTS BACK SO WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT OUR PARENTS ARE GOING TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS DECISIONS WHETHER THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN OR NOT THIS BILL AS YOU HAVE HEARD IS THE RESULT OF COUNTLESS HOURS OF WORK AND AGO SHE SHINS OVER THE LAST EIGHT WEEKS THERE ARE A THOUSAND THIRTY SEVEN SCHOOL DISTRICTS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EDUCATORS AND MILLIONS OF STUDENTS AND PARENTS. EIGHT MAYBE IN A DIFFERENT SITUATION WITH REGARD TO THE CASE RATES ACCESS TO VACCINES AND HOW PARENTS FEEL ABOUT SAID NEITHER TO STUDENTS BACK TO SCHOOL AS I STATED ALL. WHO HAVE UNIQUE NEEDS. OUR WORK OVER THE WEEKS IN THE CA. EACH SUCH. AND THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND MARGINALIZED STUDENTS. FOR EXAMPLE. TWO OF MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT VOTED TO REMAIN IN DISTANCE LEARNING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR. BECAUSE THEY'RE HEARING FROM THEIR PARENTS THAT THEY WILL NOT SEND THEIR STUDENTS BACK. AND THE INFECTION RATE OF FIVE TO NINETEEN YEAR OLDS IN ONE CITY. IS EXTREMELY HIGH. THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO MEET THE DEADLINE TO RECEIVE A SHARE OF THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WELL SOME SCHOOLS MAY NOT RE OPEN IN THE CURRENT SCHOOL YEAR. IT IS STILL CRITICAL TO SUPPORT THE SCHOOLS WHEN THEY DO REAL OPEN. AB EIGHTY SIX ALLOWS A PERCENTAGE OF EXPANDED LEARNING RECOVERY FUNDS TO USE FOR RE OPENING PURPOSES. FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT DID NOT RECEIVE THE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION GRANT. I'M VERY PROUD OF THIS PROPOSAL THE LEVEL OF FUNDING THE SCHOOLS RECEIVE TO HELP GET THEM BACK ON TRACK. IS THIS BILL PERFECT ABSOLUTELY NOT NOTHING IS BUT IT IS A START. I BELIEVE THAT WILL HELP SCHOOLS AND EDUCATORS TO PROVIDE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AS WELL AS MEET THEIR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE. FOR THEIR COUNTLESS HOURS OF WORK. OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE FOR A LONG IS TO GET THIS TO. ALL OF YOU. I SENATE STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B. EIGHTY SIX GIVING AB EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU SENATOR DR. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I DON'T HAVE ANY PREPARED REMARKS THAT TODAY IN FACT I DIDN'T- PLAN ON GETTING UP THIS MORNING BUT- YOU LISTEN TO THE PROMISE OF ALL MY COLLEAGUES HERE ON THE FLOOR. THIS MORNING IS PROMPTED ME TO- YOUR TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IT- THREE WEEKS AGO WHEN THIS LANGUAGE ON THIS BILL FIRST CAME OUT. I WAS VEHEMENTLY OPPOSED I DID OP ED IN MY LOCAL NEWSPAPERS LET'S GET OUR KIDS BACK IN SCHOOL. AND YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED I GOT NUMEROUS CALLS FROM PEOPLE THAT WORK IN AGREEMENT- WITH THAT ASSESSMENT. TEACHERS SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER INDIVIDUAL SCHOOL BOARD MEMBERS EVEN SOME SPERINTENDENTS. AS WE PROGRESS THROUGH THIS DISCUSSIONS THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY. I THOUGHT IT WASN'T FIFTY FIFTY BUT IT MIGHT EVEN BE VIA WITH PARENTS SIXTY FORTY. ON WHAT IN THEIR KIDS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL STRAIGHT I'VE GOT TWO GRANDCHILDREN THE TO GO TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS. IT'S NOT SO ROSY IN PRIVATE SCHOOLS. ARE THERE'S A NUMBER OF KIDS IN PRIVATE SCHOOL SINCE PARENTS ELECT NOT TO SEND THEM BACK. TO SCHOOL BECAUSE THEY DON'T BELIEVE IT'S SAFE. SO I REALLY WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE- I THOUGHT THE BILL IMPRINT ORIGINALLY WAS SO HORRENDOUS. OF OUR BUDGET SHARE OUR LEADER- PRO TEM ATKINS AND THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE FOR REALLY DOING AN OUTSTANDING JOB AND LISTENING WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND WHILE I'M ON THE SUBJECT OF THE GOVERNOR. I REALLY BELIEVE TO LAY THIS AT THE FEET OF OUR GOVERNOR. AND BLAMED THE GOVERNOR FOR HOW THIS IS WORK WITH OUR SCHOOLS IS REALLY SHORT SIGHTED THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS I THINK IT WAS- ARE GOOD COLLEAGUE- FROM- RIVERSIDE. SORRY I CAN'T REMEMBER ASSEMBLY BLEW THAT- BUT BUT ANYWAY TO SAID WE'VE NEVER PARTICIPATED OR BEEN IN A PANDEMIC BEFORE SO TO ALL THE SUDDEN HERE IN MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO TRY TO REWRITE THE PLAYBOOK FOR WHAT'S HAPPENED FOR THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS JUST DOESN'T REALLY MAKE A LOT OF SENSE TO ME THIS IS A GREAT STEP FORWARD. AND YOU KNOW THE OTHER THING WE'VE CALIFORNIANS WE AS AMERICANS WE ARE RESILIENT. OUR PARENTS WILL WORK WITH OUR KIDS ARE TEACHERS WILL WORK WITH OUR KIDS AND WE WILL RECOVER. FROM WHERE WE ARE I DON'T DISAGREE WITH ALL THE STUDIES IN THE ASSESSMENT. BUT- WE WILL BE THERE FOR THE EIGHTY THE HELP OF OUR KIDS IN THE FUTURE RESPECTFULLY ASK THE RIDE BUT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATOR ALSO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MISTER PRESIDENT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP- AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE INCREDIBLE HARD WORK. THAT IT TAKES WITH ALL OF THE STAKEHOLDERS. I JUST WANT TO. SURE A LITTLE BIT OF THE REALITIES OF MANY OF THE RESIDENTS IN MY DISTRICT AND ACROSS THE STATE. I SPEAK ON BEHALF OF MANY OF THOSE FAMILIES WHOSE MEMBERS ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. ESSENTIAL WORKERS IN THE SENSUAL INDUSTRIES. REAL HUMAN BEINGS THEY REALLY REALLY WORK HARD EVERY DAY TRYING TO RAISE THEIR FAMILIES TRYING TO RAISE OUR KIDS TO GET A GOOD EDUCATION. THEY ARE HOUSEHOLDS WILL NOT MULTIPLE WAGE EARNERS AND THEIR- WORKING IN NON PP PROTECTED INDUSTRIES. THESE ARE FAMILIES ARE HIDDEN THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS BUT BY AS HIGH AS THEIR COUNTIES. THEY LOOK FOR SAFETY. ON THE OTHER HAND IS OF THE SAME FAMILIES WHOSE CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING THE WORST FROM LEARNING LOS. THESE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT HADTO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AND I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL ADDRESSES BOTH SAFETY AND RECOVERY AND RE OPENING. SO WITH ALL OF THAT OUR RIGHTS TO SUPPORT A. B. EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU. THANK YOUS SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT SENATORS I TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF- EIGHTY EIGHTY SIX- AS A- FATHERS TO CHILDREN WHO- ARE- IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE DOING DISTANCE LEARNING BUT ALSO AS A PEDIATRICIAN I KNOW MY COLLEAGUES IN PEDIATRICS. HAVE BEEN URGING A RETURN TO SCHOOL- AS RAISED MANY CONCERNS THAT WE TALKED ABOUT ON THE FLOOR ABOUT- THE HEALTH. OF CHILDREN CLEAN THEIR MENTAL HEALTH. AT THE SAME TIME- THOUGH I ALSO KNOW MY COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SAFETY IN THE SCHOOL. AND I DO WANT TO. THURS REMIND PEOPLE WE STARTED OFF THE SESSION WITH A PRAYER- ABOUT THE OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE WHO DIED OF COLD INCLUDING OVER FIFTY THOUSAND HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I DO WANT TO JUST THAT DISABUSE ANYONE OF THE NOTION THAT CHILDREN- CANNOT DIE OF CODED OR BECOME VERY SICK FROM CODED. SO THAT'S CERTAINLY A VERY REAL RISK IT'S CERTAINLY MUCH SMALLER THAN THIS PEOPLE ARE OLDER AND I SHOULD REMIND YOU THAT WE HAVE TEACHERS AND STAFF TO ACTUALLY HIGH RISK WHO WORK AT SCHOOLS. EVEN THE CHILDREN THEMSELVES AND THAT'S WHY YOU HEAR FROM PARENTS SAYING. YOU KNOW I AM TIMES CITATIONS ABOUT SENDING MY KIDS TO SCHOOL EVEN THOUGH I MAY SEE MY- CHILD NOT DOING SO WELL THE DISTANCE LEARNING I AM. STILL NOT THAT EAGER TO SEND MY KIDS TO SCHOOL BECAUSE IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT THEY'RE SAFE. AND THAT IS. WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT- NOT ONLY ARE WE PROVIDING RESOURCES THIS BILL THAT- I KNOW THAT- BILL THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WORKING TO TRY TO GET. ACCESS TO GP- FOR EVEN FREE TV FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACCESS TO LOW COST TESTING OTHER VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY MEASURES. BUT I WOULD ALSO- MAKE NOTE THAT- FOR ALL THE PEOPLE SO EAGER TO GET KIDS BACK TO SCHOOL AND CERTAINLY I'M ONE OF THEM- IF THERE'S ANY CRITICISM MIGHT MAKE OF THE GOVERNOR IS THAT NOT SURE IT'S REALLY FAIR ONE. WOULD BE IS THAT UNFORTUNATE TOO MANY LOCAL OFFICIALS- WE'RE NOT WILLING TO ENFORCE VERY IMPORTANT SAFETY STANDARDS PREVENT SPREAD THE DISEASE LIKE MASKING LIKE BUSINESSES ARE APPROPRIATELY OPEN. WHERE WE CAN HAVE OUTBREAKS AND SPREAD. AND WE SAW A HUGE SPIKE IN CASES. WHERE OUR HOSPITALS OVER RUN. IN DECEMBER AND JANUARY AND FORTUNATELY WE'RE NOW IN A DOWNTURN SO WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO REOPEN OUR SCHOOLS SAFELY. SO YOU KNOW I DO AGREE WITH THAT MY GOOD FRIEND TO SAN FRANCISCO WITH THAT- WE NEED TO URGE OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OUR- YOU KNOW THE- PLACE TO WORK THERE AND THE PARENTS TO WORK TOGETHER TO GET SCHOOLS BE OPEN AGAIN AND CERTAINLY THIS BILL IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN GIVING THEM THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO LET'S GO LET'S WORK WITH OUR LOCALS LET'S LOOK AT PARENTS WITH WITH OUR TEACHERS AND STAFF OR SCHOOL LEADERSHIP TO TRY TO GET THE SCHOOLS RE OPENED THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO MOVING FORWARD. BUT ULTIMATELY THIS CAN ONLY HAPPEN IF WE ALSO CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER. TO ENSURE THAT WE STOP THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE THAT MEANS PROMOTING VACCINATION CONTINUING TO WEAR MASKS URGING. PEOPLE NOT TO MIX HOUSEHOLDS UNTIL WE GET ENOUGH PEOPLE VACCINATED AND SO WE NEED TO DO OUR PART TO ENSURE OUR. SCHOOLS CAN OPEN SAFELY AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. BAKER THANK YOU ARE RISE IN SUPPORT THIS BILL WHEN TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES TO WORK DAYS AND NIGHTS MANY WEEKENDS TO MAKE THIS A POSSIBLE. THIS SCHOOLS REOPENING PLAN GIVES US HOPE. THIS PLAN GIVES US A PATHWAY FOR KIDS TO RESTORE SOME OF THEIR CHILDHOOD IN SOME OF THE EMOTIONAL HEALTH AS WE MOVE THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. AND THE GOVERNOR'S EFFORTS YOU OUR TIES THE VACCINATION OF TEACHERS. FURTHER STRENGTHENS THAT PASSED. EARLY ON I CALLED FOR TEACHER THAT'S NATION DAYS THOSE ARE HAPPENING NOW TODAY AND TOMORROW AND I COMMEND ALL DISTRICTS ALL COUNTIES THAT ARE MOVING TO VACCINATE TEACHERS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. THIS PACKAGE IS NEEDED BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD A CALIFORNIA STUDENTS CAN'T AFFORD. TO LOSE MORE VALUABLE CLASS TIME OR SEEN THAT SCHOOL IS MORE THAN JUST LEARNING BUT ALSO THE EMOTIONAL AND SOCIAL VALUE OF INTERACTING WITH PEERS. I KNOW I SEE THIS EVERY DAY I JUST HAVE TO LOOK DOWN THE HALLWAY AND SEE MY TO HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS WHO ARE DESPERATE TO RETURN TO SCHOOL. THE GOVERNOR WAS IN MY DISTRICT ARE YESTERDAY AND WE TOWARD A SCHOOL WE SAW HOW THIS IS WORKING TO SCHOOL IS TWO THIRDS OF THE KIDS BACK. ONE THIRD NOT BACK- CHOSEN TO BE AT HOME. AND THE SCHOOL IS WORKING THEY HAD THE PP THEY HAVE EQUIPMENT THEY HAVE THE SAFETY. THAT IS A VERY POSITIVE STORY IN FACT THAT DISTRICTS. OF PALO ALTO HIGH SCHOOLS WILL ALSO BE BACK NEXT WEEK AND HOPE THAT BECOMES A MODEL FOR OUR REGION. I BELIEVE THAT WITH THE PP BUT WE KNOW OUR OUR GROWING KNOWLEDGE OF THE VIRUS AND NOW WITH THE SIX POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE. WE CAN GET OUR KIDS ARE BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. I WAS NOT CONFIDENT IN THE SAFETY I WOULD NOT SEND MY OWN KIDS BACK. LET ALONE ASK OTHERS TO BACK THIS- THAT IS THE PATHWAY TO GET OUR KIDS BACK. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST. AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR COURT CASE. THANK YOU MISTER- VERIZON'S THE TO A BOTH BOTH SB EIGHTIES. AND I WANT TO THANK ALSO WANT TO THANK THE THREE COMMITTEE CHAIRS SOME WORK SO HARD ON THIS- CENTER LABOR CENTER- LAYERED- IN- YEAH SKINNER CENTERS SKINNER OF COURSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE ASSIST. THEM HI I WANT TO TRY TO MAKE A POINT QUICKLY- WE HAVE TO REMEMBER THAT. THIS ACTION TODAY IS REALLY DIVIDED INTO TWO. ALMOST SEPARATE PIECES TWO BILLION DOLLARS TO URGE THE RE OPENING OF OUR SCHOOLS AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES STRIKE A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN LOCAL CONTROL AND LEGISLATIVE GUIDANCE. AND MANY OF US HAVE SERVED ON SCHOOL BOARDS I THINK WE NEED TO RESPECT THE ELECTED OFFICIALS WHO SERVE ON THOSE BOARDS NOTICE PLEASE YESTERDAY TO SEE A LETTER FROM THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION. URGING PASSAGE OF THE BILL. DESPITE DESPITE SOME CONCERNS THOSE ELECTED OFFICIALS HAVE A HISTORY. OF WORKING OUT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING ISSUES. THOSE DISTRICTS ARE NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL SOME OF THEM ARE ENTIRELY HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS SOME OF THEM ARE UNIFIED DISTRICTS SOME OF THEM ARE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WILL HAVE TO APPROACH RE OPENING DIFFERENTLY ALL OF THEM HAVE HIRED INVENTED AN APPOINTED SUPERINTENDENTS THAT THEY HAVE CONFIDENCE HAVE- WE I THINK WE- NEED TO RESPECT THAT AND I THINK. THE GOOD WORK OF- IT'S LEGISLATURE IN THOSE CHAIRS HAS RESPECTED THAT LOCAL CONTROL. BUT WHAT IF THERE WAS NOTHING ELSE. THE CAUSES TO SUPPORT THIS BILL WOULD REALLY BE THE OTHER PART OF THIS BILL THE FOUR POINT SIX. BILLION THAT WILL GO TO. BUT THAT WILL GO TO XCELERATED OF LEARNING THROUGH TUTORING COMMITTEE LEARNING HUBS IN A ONE EMPHASIZE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SUPPORT. ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED IN OUR HISTORY AS A COUNTRY IS THAT. SEPARATE IS ALWAYS UNEQUAL. AND I WANT TO HARKEN BACK TO THE COMMENTS OF MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES SENATOR DRAWS SO WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FROM THIS PANDEMIC AND CAUSED BY THE PANDEMIC NOT BECAUSE BY THE LEGISLATURE NOT BECAUSE BETTER SCHOOL BOARDS WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED IS. THE DIGITAL DIVIDE IS VERY REAL. AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO SAID LITTLE BIT EARLIER. THERE'S A PUBLIC PRIVATE DIVIDE THAT IS VERY REAL. THERE IS AN AFFLUENCE AND POVERTY DIVIDE THAT IS VERY REAL THERE'S A RACIAL AND ETHNIC DIVIDE THAT IS VERY REAL. AND WE ALSO LEARNED FROM THURGOOD MARSHALL IS THAT THE CONSEQUENCE OF THAT DIVIDE. HIS SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGICAL AND BEHAVIORAL IMPACT ON THE STUDENTS WHO SUFFER THOSE CONSEQUENCES. SO I THINK THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT REASON THAT WE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I WOULD PREDICT THAT IT WILL BE THE LAST INVESTMENT. WE NEED TO MAKE A TO INVEST ON THE RECOVERY OF THE STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISTER PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN. I THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT BY ACTUALLY BY TWO HAD NOT PLANNED ON SPEAKING. THIS MORNING BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO LISTEN TO THE DISCUSSION- AND WHILE COMMENDING EVERYBODY WORK ON THIS BILL WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT DURING THIS TIME. A WHOLE BUNCH OF PEOPLE I HAVE WORKED VERY HARD I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FACT. BUT LET US RECOGNIZE NOTED DURING THIS TIME THE WORK OF ALL THE ADMINISTRATORS WHO HAVE TRIED TO MAKE. THE SITUATIONS WORK. LET'S NOT FORGET LET'S RECOGNIZE THE TEACHERS. WHO HAVE WORKED NIGHT AND DAY HARDER THAN THEY'VE EVER WORKED IN THEIR PROFESSIONAL LIVES. NOT JUST TO TEACH BUT TO STAY CONNECTED TO THEIR STUDENTS- AND TO BE THERE FOR THEM. LET US NOT FORGET THE SCHOOL STAFF. WHO HAS FOUND NEW AND INNOVATIVE WAYS THAT SOMETIMES AT THEIR OWN EXPENSE- AT GREAT PERSONAL RISK TO PROVIDE MEALS TO STUDENTS WHO OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE RECEIVED THEM. AT SCHOOL AS PART OF THE SCHOOL DAY- AND LET'S RECOGNIZE AND SYMPATHIZE WITH THE PARENTS. WHO HAVE HAD TO FIND NEW WAYS TO INTERACT WITH THEIR KIDS UNVEILED THEIR PROFESSIONAL- AND WORKING LIVES WITH THEIR STUDENTS EDUCATIONS. AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE STUDENTS THIS WILL BE THE MOST DEFINING THAT EPISODE EXPERIENCE IN THEIR LIVES MUCH AS WAR HAS BEEN THE DEFINING EXPERIENCE FOR. S. GENERATIONS BUT LET'S NOT FORGET THAT- AND IF WE MAKE THIS VOTE TODAY. LET'S DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO HELP THEM MOVE FORWARD IN THEIR LIVES THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER ALERT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PRESIDENT- THIS HAS BEEN A VERY ROBUST DEBATE AND TO WE HAD A VERY ROBUST DEBATE IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AND I WOULD LIKE TO TIED TOGETHER OF SOME OF THE THINGS WE HEARD AND SPEAK TO THEM. BECAUSE WHEN THIS DEBATE REALLY STARTED WHEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS HIS PROPOSAL WAS REALLY DESIGNED TO. MORE FORCE SCHOOLS TO OPEN BECAUSE THE PANDEMIC WAS SO DEEP AT THE TIME IN THE SUBSEQUENT TIME THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BETTER- CASES HAVE DROPPED ACROSS THE STATE. AND SO THIS BILL REFLECTS BOTH THOSE FACTS IT TAKES THE TWO BILLION DOLLARS AND REALLY DOES PROVIDE AN INCENTIVE TO MOVE PEOPLE TO OPEN AND REWARDS THOSE THAT FOCUS. THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION AND THE OTHER HALF WHICH DEALS FOR WHAT HAS BEEN CALLED LEARNING LOSS REALLY DOES GO TO EVERYBODY AND SO IT REALLY ENABLES PEOPLE TO OPEN BECAUSE ENABLING IS WHAT HAS CHANGED IN WHAT HAS GONE ON WITH THE PANDEMIC. AND WHEN I TALKED IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. WE HAD HEARD FROM SENATOR NIELSEN. AND SENATOR NIELSEN IS LUCKY COMPARED TO THE MOST OF US BECAUSE HE REPRESENTS COUNTIES THAT HAVE HAD AMONG THE LOWEST CASE RATES IN THE STATE. AND WE ALSO HEARD FROM SENATOR GARAGE SO WHO REPRESENTS THE DISTRICT AT THE OTHER END. WHERE THE CASES ARE HIGHER IT'S MORE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND THERE IS A REAL CONCERN ABOUT COMING BACK IN PERSON. THAT I SPOKE TO MY OWN DISTRICT WHERE THERE ARE MORE AFFLUENT AREAS LESS DIVERSE ON THE COAST. AND THEY'RE MORE DIVERSE AREAS INTERGENERATIONAL FAMILIES MANY THAT WORK ON FARMS THAT ARE IN THE IN ONE PART OF THE DISTRICT AND BOTH ARE REPRESENTED THERE. AND SO. WHAT WE HAD TO DO IS CRAFT A BILL THAT MATCHED ALL THOSE DIFFERENT CONDITIONS. THAT MATCHED THE DIFFERENCES THAT EXIST THROUGHOUT OUR STATE OF FORTY MILLION. AND WE REALLY TARGETED- THE KIDS THAT HAVE BEEN LEFT OUT DURING THE DISTANCE LEARNING WE TARGETED THE KIDS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS THOSE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING PROBLEMS BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGY OR CONNECTIVITY ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS THOSE TO JUST SIMPLY DROPPED OUT FOR WHATEVER REASON AND THOSE THAT ARE AT RISK OF ABUSE AND NEGLECT THOSE ARE PRIORITIZED IN EACH CATEGORY. BUT IT WAS VERY SIGNIFICANT THAT SENATOR DORADO WALKED OVER TO ME AFTER THAT DEBATE WAS DONE AND SAID YOU KNOW SOME OF US REPRESENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS EVERY KID IS DISADVANTAGED AND EVERY KID NEEDS TO BE A PRIORITY AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE TRIED TO ADDRESS IN THIS BILL AND FOR EXAMPLE IN THE FOUR POINT SIX BILLION. ORIGINALLY THE PROPOSAL WAS JUST TO GIVE IT UP TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE ABOUT READY TO OPEN. AND IF YOU DID THAT YOU ARE PRIORITIZING DISPROPORTIONATELY. MORE AFFLUENT DISTRICTS AND YOU WERE DISADVANTAGING. THE MORE DISADVANTAGED DISTRICTS IN THIS BILL WIPES OUT THAT DIFFERENCE IT BASICALLY SAYS THAT EVERY DISTRICT WILL BE ELIGIBLE FOR THAT MONEY. THERE WAS A QUESTION THAT CAME UP IN THE BUDGET DEBATE ABOUT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND WHETHER THEY WERE DISADVANTAGED AND THE DISTINCTION WAS. THAT MANY CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE DISTANCE LEARNING ALREADY BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THEY WEREN'T STOPPING THEIR CONTINUING SO THAT DOESN'T ADDRESS THAT BUT IT WILL HELP CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN LIKE MANY PUBLIC SCHOOLS AND SUSPENDED IN PERSON ONE. WHEN THE PANDEMIC CAN'T. NOW THE REAL PROBLEM IS. TRYING TO TAKE A STATE WIDE BILL AND NOT HAVING A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH AND IT WAS SUGGESTED EARLIER THAT WE SHOULD MANDATE- CERTAIN NUMBER OF DAYS BEING OPEN. WELL THERE'S A CONSISTENT STANDARD IN THIS BILL ON THE CONSISTENT STANDARDS FLEXIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE. IF WE HAD A CLASSROOM THAT WAS SO BIG. THAT YOU CAN'T SOCIALLY DISTANCE AND BRING THE WHOLE CLASS BACK TOGETHER YOU COULD HAVE HALF THE WEEK IN PERSON FOR HALF THE CLASS HALF THE WEEK IN PERSON FOR THE OTHER HALF OF THE CLASS. DISTANCE WARNING WHEN THEY'RE NOT IN PERSON AND IF WE FORCED THEM TO OPEN IT WOULD HAVE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE SINCE THEY ALL CAN'T FIT IN THE CLASS OF PROBABLY KEEP MATH CLASS CLOSED UNTIL VAT AS WHY THE CONSISTENT STANDARD IS FLEXIBILITY SO AS WAS SAID BY SENATOR CORTESE WITH UP TO SCHOOL BOARDS DECIDE WITH WHAT THE LOCALS DECIDE. HOW IT BEST FOR. AND SENATOR PAM. I WAS VERY CONCERNED AS A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL WE DON'T LEGISLATE THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE THAT WAS ALSO SUGGESTED EARLIER TODAY AND IT REALLY LEAVES IT TO THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS THIS BILL REFERENCES REQUIRED OR IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE BUT IT DOESN'T DICTATE WHAT THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE IS AND THERE WAS SOME FLEXIBILITY AND THAT. THE PEOPLE PREPARING THE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS PREPARING THE GUIDANCE SAID YOU SHOULD DO SIX FEET DIFFERENCE FOR STUDENTS BUT IF YOU MAKE A GOOD FAITH EFFORT AND YOU CAN'T SATISFY IT. YOU COULD GO AS LOW AS FOUR SO THEY RECOGNIZED THAT FLEXIBILITY THAT WAS THERE. THE END IT IS ALSO TRUE. THERE WAS A MISREPRESENTATION IN A COLUMN IN THE LA TIMES THAT IMPLIED THAT VACCINATIONS WERE REQUIRED AS PART OF THIS BILL. THEY ARE NOT IT IS OUR PRIORITIZATION AND THE CDC. CHURCH AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. WE SHOULD RETURN REQUIRE IT THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT CDC GUIDANCE IN PRESIDENT BIDEN SAYS WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THIS BILL IS CONSISTENT WITH FACT. THE END AND SO IT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE IN THE END. FINALLY THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS. ABOUT DIFFERENT GROUPS AND HOW THEY MIGHT HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS BILL OR HOW THE BILL MIGHT AFFECT THEM. AND THERE WAS A CONCERN IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE. FETID MINISTRATIONS OF MARK TO IN THIS PROCESS. THAT'S NOT TRUE. THERE'S NO PENALTY AND THERE WAS A REALLY PROTECTION FOR SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ALREADY OPENED THEY GET TO CONTINUE THEYRE NOT PENALIZED AND REQUIRED TO CLOSE. THIS DOES NOT REINVENT THE WHEEL FOR TESTING. THIS ALLOWS A LOCAL TESTING. ABILITY TO JUST BE SIGNED OFF ON AND CONTINUE AND BY THE WAY SINCE WE HAD THE BUDGET DEBATE ON TUESDAY. THERE WAS APPROVAL OF MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT FOR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS AND TESTING AND THAT WILL BRING MORE MONEY TO THE TABLE FOR THIS RE OPENING. IN THE DISTRICTS AND WITH THE STUDENTS THAT NEED IT MOST- THERE ALSO IS NO APPLICATION PROCESS WE DON'T WANT TO SLOW DOWN. ARE WE REALLY WANTED THIS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE AND GET OUT THE DOOR. THEY DON'T HAVE TO THE DISTRICT'S REDO THEIR COVERT PLAN IF THEY HAVE AN EXISTING ONE THAT WAS APPROVED IN. AND BARGAINED IT JUST CONTINUES NO REINVENTING THE WHEEL. AND I KNOW CENTRO TROUBLED WAS VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT THE OFFER THE APPROVAL PROCESS- THAT WOULD GO ON BY. OF CERTAIN PLAN AND THERE'S A TRIGGER THAT HALF OF AFTER FIVE DAY STAY ON APPROVED IT'S AUTOMATICALLY PUT SO THERE'S NOT A BUREAUCRATIC DELAY HERE AND IT REALLY MOVES AND THEN THERE WAS A CONCERN REYES TO MANY OF THE MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR. THAT THE BILL WOULD PENALIZE INDEPENDENT STUDIES THAT WAS ADDRESSED THAT WAS TAKEN OUT. OF AND THE BILL IS GOOD AND THAT IS WHY WE ALL GOT LETTERS FROM ALMOST EVERY SINGLE ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SCHOOL BOARDS SCHOOL DISTRICT SCHOOL BOARD SUPERINTENDENTS SAY THEY SUPPORT THIS BILL. ON THE OTHER SIDE. TEACHERS AND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES OR OUR PARTNERS IN THIS PROCESS AS WELL. AND SENATOR MELENDEZ MENTION TUTORING WELL PARA PROFESSIONALS ARE IN HERE THAT IS TO RING THAT ALLOWSSTEP ONE FOR ONE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS OF GREAT CONCERN. THE VACCINES% THAT WAS ADDED SINCE IT WAS FIRST PROPOSED IN THE WAY I PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED THAT PROVIDE SOME OF THE FEARS ABOUT SCHOOL EMPLOYEES AND TEACHERS GOING BACK. WE REQUIRE THAT THERE BE TESTING IN THE PURPLE TEAR. WE REQUIRE THE PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE WHICH REQUIRES THE TESTING AND THAT IS TO GIVE SOME ASSURANCE TO ANY TEACHER OR SCHOOL EMPLOYEE THAT MIGHT HAVE TO RETURN IN THE EARLY CORPORATION PURPLE. AND ALSO THIS BILL FROM THE FIRST INCARNATION BEEPS UP ENFORCEMENT BEATS UP TACTICAL SYSTEMS SO THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE NOT LEFT BY THEMSELVES THE PEOPLE ARE LOOKING TO MAKE SURE. THAT THE THINGS THAT ARE SPELLED OUT IN THIS. THE BILL FORD HERE TO SO AS I SAID IN FRONT OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE THIS WAS HARD. THIS WAS HARD BECAUSE WE HAD TO DO A SENATOR LEYVA REFER TO. OVER A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS STATEWIDE DISTRICTS OF EVERY ECONOMIC STATUS DISTRICT OF EVERY LEVEL OF THE PANDEMIC DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO TEACH THEIR STUDENTS BECAUSE IT WAS MENTIONED ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF STUDENTS AND I HAVE TO SAY. WHEN I FIRST HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT SCHOOL RE OPENING WHITE BEFORE EVEN THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED THE RE OPENING. IT WAS LIKE WHY WOULD WE RE OPEN FOR SIX WEEKS. AFTER BEING HIT DISTANCE LEARNING FOR SEVEN MONTHS AND THE ANSWER WAS. THAT SOCIALIZATION IS SO IMPORTANT TO THE STUDENTS BUT GETTING BACK BEING WITH THEIR PEERS WOULD BE THE BIGGEST HELP TO MENTAL HEALTH AND PERSONAL HELP. AS WHAT THE INSTRUCTIONS SO I THINK THIS BILL ADDRESSES ALMOST EVERY ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT TO US IN THIS PROCESS IT MOVES US AHEAD. I THINK IT'S A GOOD BILL GOT UNANIMOUS SUPPORT IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE MISTER PRESIDENT I REQUEST AN IPHONE. THANK YOU SEEN NO FURTHER MIKE SO I THINK WE CAN CONCLUDE ON WHAT WE WILL ALL AGREE WITH A HEALTHY DEBATE. CENTER SKINNER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR SO FAR AND I THINK WHAT IS EVIDENT FROM WHAT WE'VE DISCUSSED IS THAT DETAILS MATTER. AS MANY PARENTS WANT THEIR CHILDREN BACK IN THE CLASSROOM THERE ARE JUST AS MANY WHO ARE AFRAID AND AFRAID WITH GOOD REASON. THE PANDEMIC AS OUR FOR OUR COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO THE GOOD DOCTOR REMINDED US. HAS KILLED OVER HALF A MILLION PEOPLE AND LEFT MILLIONS WITH THE LONG TERM HEALTH PROBLEMS. ANY DISTRESSED ALL OF US THERE IS NO ONE WHO IS NOT BEEN HARMED BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND W WILL NOT BE ON STRESSED OR UNHARMED UNTIL WE CURB ITS SPREAD. AND WE CAN ONLY CURB ITS SPREAD IF WE FOLLOW THE APPROPRIATE SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND THAT IS EVERYWHERE INCLUDING OUR SCHOOLS AND WE KNOW THAT OUR- STAFF OR TEACHERS OR PARENTS OR CHILDREN. ARE NOT GOING TO FEEL COMFORTABLE RETURNING TO IN PERSON INSTRUCTION UNLESS THEY FEEL SOME CONFIDENCE THAT IT'S SAFE. AND WE HAVE DONE OUR BEST TO PROVIDE THAT- BY. ALLOWING ACCESS TO VACCINATIONS NOT REQUIRING THEM BUT ALLOWING THAT ACCESS BY. REQUIRING CERTAIN TESTING PROTOCOLS IN THOSE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST POVERTY RATES AND BY REQUIRING THE DISTANCE IN THE OTHER MEASURES THAT WE KNOW ARE NEEDED WE ALSO KNOW THAT NOT ALL CLASSROOMS OR SCHOOLS ARE DESIGNED THE SAME OR HAVE THE SAME CAPACITIES IF FOR EXAMPLE THE CDC ITSELF POINTS OUT THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE INDOORS THE ABSOLUTELY BEST CIRCUMSTANCE IS ONE WHERE WINDOWS ARE OPEN AND A GREAT VENTILATION SYSTEM. I KNOW EACH AND EVERYONE OF US CAN GO TO ONE SCHOOL IN OUR DISTRICT AND SHOULD POINT OUT OF CLASSROOM MANY CLASSROOMS FOR WHICH THE WINDOWS CANNOT OPEN AND THERE IS NOT A GOOD VENTILATION SYSTEM. SO IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE DETAILS ARE DRESSED AND THAT WE HAVE SET UP A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE PEOPLE CAN FEEL SAFE WHICH WE HAVE DONE ARENDT. WE ARE NOT RE OPENING SCHOOLS EDUCATION HAS BEEN WHILE INADEQUATE IT HAS CONTINUED WHAT WE ARE DOING IS CREATING A PATHWAY FOR MORE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THERE HAS BEEN AS BEEN POINTED OU IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN VARIOUS DISTRICTS IN VARIOUS PLACES ACROSS THE STATE BUT WE KNOW IT IS NOT BEEN. EQUAL OR ACCESSIBLE TO EVERYONE AND WE ARE TRYING TO PROVIDE THAT AND THAT'S WHAT WE ARE DOING WITH THIS BILL- THAT IS REALLY. ALL I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT IT THE REST OF YOU HAVE MADE SOME VERY VERY GOOD POINTS- MANY OF US SPEND FAR MORE HOURS IN THE EVENINGS ON WEEKENDS THAN WE EVER EXPECTED BUT IT WAS NECESSARY BECAUSE DETAILS MATTER AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE.
