PER THE BILL THE TASK FORCE MUST CONSIST OF REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE DEPARTMENT ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM THE COMMUNITY RESIDENTS AND STAFF OF THE HOME. AS WELL AS LOCAL VETERANS GROUP GROUPS. UPON THE REVIEW COMPLETION THE TASK FORCE IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE.

THE BILL TRANSPARENCY INTO PROPOSED VETERANS HOME CLOSURES AND ALLOW FOR PUBLIC INPUT SO THE DEPARTMENT CAN. MAKE CONSIDER THE IMPLICATIONS OF SUCH ACTION JOINING ME TODAY IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING IS. CIMBRIAN COUNTY SUPERVISOR DON ROWE THIRD DISTRICT SUPERVISOR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR AND- DO WE HAVE SUPERVISOR DON ROWE ON THE LINE. SUPERVISOR ROBIE'S PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. I DO NOT SEE HIM CURRENTLY ON THE PHONE LINES. ALRIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON SURE ONE WOMAN OR ONE OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO START BY THANKING EACH OF YOU FOR YOUR UNWAVERING COMMITMENT. PART OF OUR CALIFORNIA VETERANS MY NAME IS DON ROW AND I SERVICE THE THIRD DISTRICT SUPERVISOR FOR SAN BERNARDINO COUNTY. MY DISTRICT INCLUDES THE CITY OF BARSTOW AND THE VETERANS HOME. I'M A VERY SYMPATHETIC AND INTERESTED- PERSON WHEN IT COMES TO VETERAN ISSUES AS I AM A GOLD STAR WIFE MY LATE HUSBAND WAS KILLED IN COMBAT IN IRAQ IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. SO I UNDERSTAND FIRST HAND WHAT OUR SERVICE MEMBERS SACRIFICE FOR OUR FREEDOMS. LAST YEAR I WAS APPALLED TO LEARN OF THE PROPOSED CLOSURE OF THE BARSTOW VETERANS HOME AS A METHOD TO SOLVE THE STATE'S BUDGET DEFICIT. CLOSING THE HOME WOULD HAVE DISPLACED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED VETERANS AND REQUIRED MOST IF NOT ALL TO RELOCATE TO OTHER VETERANS HOMES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. YOU CAN IMAGINE THERE WAS AN IMMEDIATE OUTPOURING OF OPPOSITION TO THE VETERANS GROUPS. COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND LOCAL ELECTED LEADER LOCAL ELECTED LEADERS LIKE MYSELF. WE WERE FRUSTRATED TO DISCOVER THAT THERE WASN'T A FORMAL PROCESS FOR COMMUNITIES AFFECTED BY PROPOSED CLOSURES TO WEIGH IN. VETERANS HOMES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF THE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SERVE AND IT WAS CLEAR THAT THERE NEEDED TO BE MORE TRANSPARENT PROCESS THAT PROVIDED AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR PUBLIC INPUT. THIS IS WHY I COMMEND SENATOR GROW FOR INTRODUCING SENATE BILL THREE FORTY EIGHT. THIS MEASURE ESTABLISHES A PUBLIC PARTICIPATION PROCESS FOR PROPOSED VETERANS HOME CLOSURES. AND GIVES A STRONGER VOICE TO VETERANS AT RISK OF LOSING THE BENEFIT THAT THEY RIGHTFULLY EARNED ON THE BATTLEFIELD.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE HAVE NO OF A OPPOSITION REGISTERED TO- FOR LEAD WITNESSES SO ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES ON THE LINE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU FOR IN OPPOSITION OF SB THREE FORTY EIGHT YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. THAT'S THE ONE THAT THEN ZERO FOR ANY OPPOSITION.

THIS BILL WILL HELP ALL VETERANS WHO SEEK JOBS THAT UTILIZES BENEFIT ACCORDING TO THE DISABLED VETERANS OF AMERICA. TODAY WOMEN ARE SERVING IN GREATER NUMBERS OF U. S.

MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KEVIN BAKER THE MARKET SOME OF THE VIRGINIA ALSO TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF COALITION OF CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE PALACES. THEY TELL YOU IN THE OPEN IN OPPOSITION A LOT OF ACTIVITY ON BEHALF OF VETERANS THE MANY. AND WE APPLAUDED GO ABOVE EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES FOR VETERANS. WE ARE NOT A TO THE VERY VOTER. OF THIS BILL AND WE WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SEE IT MOVE FORWARD. WITH ONE SMALL BUT IMPORTANT CHANGE. WHICH IS TO PRESERVE LONGSTANDING PROTECTIONS AGAINST UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION. CALIFORNIA HAD MULTIPLE. OPTIONS FOR MANY DECADES WITHOUT EXCEPTION. AND THERE IS NO NEED TO LIMIT THEM NOW. IT IS PERFECTLY POSSIBLE TO ALLOW PRIVATE EMPLOYERS TO HAVE VETERANS PERKINS POLICIES WITHOUT DISCRIMINATING AGAINST OTHERS. TWO GOALS DO NOT NEED TO BE IN CONFLICT. EXCEPT AT THE OFFICE UNFORTUNATELY WRITTEN A BILL THAT WAY. HE DID NOT ALL DR TO PRACTICE DISCRIMINATION IN THEIR NAME. IT IS REGRETTABLE THIS MEASURE UNNECESSARILY ASKS YOU TO DO SO. WE COULD HAVE BETTERMENT PROVINCES AND STILL MAINTAIN A LONGSTANDING CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS. IF YOU CHOOSE TO DO SO WE ASK THAT YOU RESPECT YOUR COMMITMENT TO BOTH VETERANS AND CIVIL RIGHTS LAWS MEDINA WE HAVE A QUESTION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER BAKER AND YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER. WASN'T THERE ONE MORE WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. NOW I CURRENTLY HAVE NO LINES QUEUED UP AT THIS TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OPERATOR ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION ON THE CHAMBER FLOOR OR IN THE GALLERY. SEEING NONE ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION AT THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION. HEARING THAT OKAY I WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE THIS RARE SUTRI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR A BRING THIS BILL FORWARD- I APOLOGIZE FOR. NOT HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO- ENGAGED TO REACH OUT TO YOU EARLIER TO. RAISE THE CONCERNS THAT WERE JUST RAISED BY THE ACLU- IT SEEMS THAT- THAT- I KNOW THAT YOU APPRECIATE THIS DILEMMA FOR MANY OF US- INCLUDING I'M SURE YOURSELF IN WANTING TO SHOW OUR SUPPORT AND APPRECIATION RESPECT FOR VETERANS WITH THIS VOLUNTARY VETERANS HIRING PREFERENCE. WELL WITHOUT- COMPROMISING THE- DISCRIMINATION PROTECTIONS- FOR OTHER PROTECTED GROUPS CAN YOU RESPOND TO BE OF THE QUESTION RAISED BY THE ACLU- YOU KNOW WHY WE CANNOT TO. WHY THIS BILL CANNOT MAKE IT CLEAR THAT- THAT- WE CAN SUPPORT VOLUNTARY HIRING PREFERENCES WHILE ALSO MAKING CLEAR THAT DISPARATE IMPACT DISCRIMINATION IS STILL PROHIBITED- SURE THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- MURATSUCHI SO I SHOULD MAKE IT CLEAR IN THE OPENING THAT THAT WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT PROVIDES THE SAME KINDS ALTHOUGH EVEN MORE CONSTRAINED OF VETERANS PREFERENCES THAT EXISTS IN ALL FIFTY STATES AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN TERMS OF GOVERNMENTAL HIRING. ALSO PROVIDES SOMETHING THAT'S EVEN MORE CONSTRAINED THAT WHAT EXIST IN THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES- AND I APPRECIATE MR BAKERIES RAISE CONCERNS AND- IMPROVE THE BILL SO FOR EXAMPLE AS I MENTIONED THE OPENING. THAT ANYONE WHO WAS DISCHARGED UNDER THE- PROVISIONS THAT PROVIDED FOR DISCHARGE OF INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION THAT THAT THEY WOULD BE TREATED AS A VETERAN FOR ALL PURPOSES. UNDER THIS BILL SO. THE CONCERN I THINK OF THE ACLU IS IT HAS A DISPARATE IMPACT IN OTHER WORDS OF THE UNIVERSE OF VETERANS IS. A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MALE AND HIS FEMALE- AND THERE HAVE BEEN PAST DISCRIMINATORY PRACTICES OF THE MILITARY ONE THE MOST EGREGIOUS WAS DISCRIMINATING BASED ON SEXUAL ORIENTATION OR YOUR- GENDER UP AFFIRMATION THAT KIND OF THING. BOB THAT'S NOT THE DEPARTMENT DEFENSE TODAY BUT THE QUESTION IS DO WE BASICALLY NOT PROVIDE BUT FIFTY STATES ARE PROVIDING BECAUSE THE PAST DISCRIMINATION MILITARY I THINK NOT I MEAN I THINK THE REASON PEOPLE THAT THEY CAN DISAGREE. AND IT DOES HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT IT HAS A DISK IT IS. GOING TO DISCREETLY IMPACTED TINO'S BECAUSE LATINOS FORM A GREATER PORTION OF THE MILITARY THAN THEY DO THE GENERAL POPULATION THE SAME THING WITH AFRICAN AMERICANS IT'S GOING TO HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACT BECAUSE AFRICAN AMERICANS COMPRISE A LARGER PORTION MILITARY THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. SO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT- THERE'S AN ISSUE CONCERNING THE UNIVERSE. OF POTENTIAL APPLICANTS- A SKEWS MALE IT DOES SKEW MALE IT'S CHANGING AS WAS POINTED OUT WHEN I FIRST JOINED THE MILITARY WAS NOT. 8% FEMALE NOW- IT'S 20% THE RECRUITS AND SO- WHAT THIS DOES IS IT DOES IT RECOGNIZE THE SERVICE ALSO PROVIDES EMPLOYERS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY THAT WE IN THE GOVERNMENT HAVE. TO UTILIZE THE SKILLS ARE DEVELOPED IN THE MILITARY BY MILITARY PERSONNEL GOVERNMENT HAS THAT. OPPORTUNITY PRIVATE SECTOR SHOULD AS WELL. OKAY SO- YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE SAYING THAT- THE REASON WHY THIS BILL CAN NOT EXPLICITLY PROHIBIT DISPARATE IMPACT DISCRIMINATION IS BECAUSE YOU'RE A KNOWLEDGE THING THAT IT WOULD LEAD TO. A DESPERATE IMPACT. FOR OVER REPRESENTED GROUPS LIKE BLACKS AND LATINOS IF WE ARE GOING TO WAIT. I MEAN I SUPPOSE IF YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY THIS PRINCIPLE YOU WOULD SAY THAT WE SHOULD REVOKE THE PREFERENCE IN CALIFORNIA FOR FIRST STATE EMPLOYEES WAS REVOKED THE OTHER PREFERENCES- IF WE'RE GOING TO WAIT UNTIL THERE'S FIFTY PERCENT. FEMALE AND 50% MALES WHO ARE IN THE UNIVERSE OF VETERANS IT WILL NOT BE IN MY LIFETIME I GUESS IT WON'T BE IN ANY OF OUR LIFETIMES SO THE QUESTION IS SO EIGHT EIGHT A FEMALE WHO'S LEAVING THE MILITARY FORCE TODAY. COMING BACK- IS A DISPROPORTION BY THE WAY VETERANS WHO. SUFFER DISABILITY COMING BACK FROM AFGHANISTAN COMING BACK FROM IRAQ. WE SAY YOU KNOW. MADAM YOU ARE NOT ENTITLED TO THIS PREFERENCE AS YOU WOULD BE IN THIRTY NINE OTHER STATES- IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR THE FIFTY OTHER STATES. BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO WAIT UNTIL THE RATIO IS EQUAL. DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO ME I THINK WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE THEIR SERVICE PROVIDE PRIVATE EMPLOYERS THE SAME RIGHT AS WE PROVIDE THE GOVERNMENT- GOVERNMENT PLAYERS. BUT IF I MAY I MEAN. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS DOES POINT OUT. THAT THIS ISN'T JUST A MATTER OF SPECULATION BUT IT SEEMS LIKE THERE HAVE BEEN- FEDERAL AND STATE CASES FEDERAL CASES. THAT HAVE INVALIDATED THESE VOLUNTARY VETERANS PREFERENCES ON THE BASIS OF THE ADVERSE IMPACT. THE AND IT YEAH I'M SORRY GO AHEAD IT IS SO BY MY CONCERN IS THAT- I I'M- NOT AS FAMILIAR- IN TERMS OF WHAT- HOW THIS IS- OTHER STATES HAVE AVOIDED- THESE FINDINGS OF- HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO INVALIDATE THE BONTA BURKE VETERANS PREFERENCES IN OTHER STATES BUT- MINUTE IT DOES. HERE TO SUPPORT THE OPPOSITION'S ARGUMENT BUT I AM QUITE CONFIDENT THAT IF IT IS A CHALLENGE THAT ATTORNEY GENERAL BONTA- MUCH LIKE THE OTHER THIRTY. NINE ATTORNEYS GENERAL IN THE U. S. ATTORNEY GENERAL WOULD SUCCESSFULLY DEFEND. I THANK YOU SPATH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SENATOR ACTUALLY APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS YOU'RE DOING- WITH THIS BILL I STARTED- ACTUALLY GOT POLITICALLY INVOLVED DURING MY COLLEGIATE YEARS AS A- COMBAT VETERAN WHO SURVIVED TWO DEPLOYMENTS- PERSHING. FOR VETERANS ADVOCACY AND IN SUCH THINGS AS OF THIS FRANKLY I FIND IT APPALLING THAT THE OPPOSITION EVEN HAS THE AUDACITY TO TRY TO MAKE THIS IS AN ISSUE- THAT IT'S UNFAIR. WHAT'S UNFAIR IS FOR THEM TO WHINE AND COMPLAIN THAT OTHERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE THE GUTS TO SIGN THE DOTTED LINE. SHOULD GET THE SAME TREATMENT AS THOSE THAT DID. I IMPLORE YOU ON WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND I'D LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR. AND HELP MOVE THIS FORWARD. OR VETERANS CITED DOTTED LINE. REGARDLESS OF THEIR BACKGROUND BECAUSE IN THE MILITARY WE DON'T CARE ABOUT THAT. IT'S NOT ABOUT WHO YOU ARE AND WHERE YOU COME FROM AND ALL THAT OTHER NONSENSE IT'S ABOUT BEING AMERICANS AND SERVING A COSTS. AND PROTECTING THE FREEDOM FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO COMPLAIN AND WHINE. I LIKE TO HELP YOU IN THIS ENDEAVOR IF YOU WOULD SO SHE'S DEFINITELY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS IN THE GOOD SENATOR- MANY OF OUR MILITARY MEMBERS JOIN UP WHEN THEY GRADUATE FROM HIGH SCHOOL. AND THEY'RE TRAINED AND CONDITIONED BY THE MILITARY. WHEN THEY GET OUT TWO TO FOUR YEARS LATER OR IN MY CASE NINE YEARS LATER. THEY HAVE TO MAKE THE TRANSITION AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT THAT'S WHY WE HAVE SO MANY HOMELESS VETERANS THEY CAN'T GET JOBS THEY COULDN'T TRANSITION THEY COULDN'T CHANGE IT TO CIVILIAN LIFE THIS BILL HELPS TREMENDOUSLY. AND AS FAR AS WOMEN VETERANS GO PER CAPITA WOMEN VETERANS HAVE A 65% HIGHER SUICIDE RATE PER CAPITA. SO THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY HAVING EVEN MORE PROBLEMS TRANSITION IN GETTING A JOB TAKING CARE OF THEIR CHILDREN OR FUTURE-CHILDREN- SO THIS BILL. DEFINITELY HELPS THIS BILL WILL SAVE LIVES AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST TO BE PLACED AS A CO AUTHOR. I THANK THE MEMBER FAMILY MEMBER DALY. OR SO ONE. I WANT TO ENDORSE THIS QUALITY BILL THAT CENTER- BURKE IS BROUGHT TO US IT MAKES GREAT SENSE HE MAKES A GREAT CASE FOR THE BILL. AND- I WAS WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL MAKES CLEAR THE PREFERENCE CANNOT BE USED AS A PRETEXT INTENTIONALLY DISCRIMINATE DISCRIMINATE AGAINST OTHER APPLICANTS. THE BILL WILL CLARIFY THE EXERCISING SUCH A PREFERENCE WOULD NOT VIOLATE STATE OR LOCAL ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS. VERY WELL CRAFTED BILL AND I SALUTE CENTER ON BURKE FOR IT. ALL RIGHT DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS A SENATE AMBERG WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE PLEASE. NO THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION. AND I WILL ALLRIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD. THAT MANY EMPLOYERS HAVE A VETERAN HIRING PROGRAM SAID FOR MANY THAT AN APPLICANT WITH A MILITARY BACKGROUND IS AN ATTRACTIVE POTENTIAL HIGHER. AND I DON'T WANT TO AMPLIFY THE INTERPRETATION THAT IT'S NECESSARILY DISCRIMINATORY OR ILLEGAL TO HIRE OF VETERANS THAT BEING SAID THE LAW HASN'T BEEN UPDATED FOR A VERY LONG TIME AND TIME AND THE INTENT OF YOUR BILL IS A QUITE CLEAR. I DO UNDERSTAND THE ARGUMENT BEING MADE BY THE BILL'S SUPPORTERS AND I HOPE WHERE THE OPPOSITION OFFERS HELPFUL SUGGESTIONS THAT SAID YOU WOULD LOOK AT THEM. AND- SO- THIS BILL DOES ENJOY A DO PASS RECOMMENDATION AND WE DID HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TO AND IF I COULD HAVE SECRETARY PLEASE READ DID WRONG. SENATE BILL SIX SIX FIVE BY UMBERG.
