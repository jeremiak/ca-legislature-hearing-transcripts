WALKING TODAY'S JOINT INFORMATIONAL HEARING I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THIS IS THE FIRST STEP IN WHAT WILL BE A LONG PROCESS AND LIKE TO THINK SENATOR MCGUIRE ON AND THE MEMBERS OF BOTH COMMITTEES AND THE PANELS FOR MAKING TODAY'S JOINT. INFORMATIONAL HEARING POSSIBLE. THE SUPREME COURT'S RECENT DECISION. HAS CREATED AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO ADDRESS AN ISSUE THAT HAS IMPACTED MAINSTREET BUSINESS FOR YEARS. SPECIFICALLY WAY FAR ALLOWS CALLING FOR YOU TO MORE EASILY COLLECT SALES TAX FROM ONLINE RETAILERS. THIS HEARING HOWEVER IS NOT ABOUT A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL OR HOW WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD WITH LEGISLATION THE GOAL TODAY'S HEARING IS SLIP IT SIMPLY TO EDUCATE OURSELVES. ABOUT WELFARE DECISION -- WHAT EXISTING LAW IS IN THE NEW IT AND WHAT IF ALREADY DO STATES HAVE UNDER WAY FAIR AND HOW WILL THE DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION DEAL WITH THE BROADER COLLECTION PRACTICES? BUT WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO SENATOR MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AYE MADAM CHAIR -- ONE SEAT THANK YOU ALL OF YOU FOR TAKING TIME IN YOUR BUSY SCHEDULE TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND YOU KNOW SOMEONE APOLOGIZES I DID THE CHAIR WOMAN. FOR BEING A BIT TARDY TODAY AND I WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR WOMAN CHAIRMAN BURKE -- FOR HER INITIATING THIS HEARING YOU BRING US TOGETHER IN THE JOINT FASHION WERE VERY VERY GRATEFUL FOR THAT -- IN AS YOU HEARD FROM THE CHAIR WOMAN THIS DECISION IS MOST SIGNIFICANT TAX CASE DECIDED BY THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN MORE THAN THREE DECADES. AND ITS ACCOMPLISH WHAT CONGRESS HAD WE AT THAT REPEAL THE ANTIQUATED PHYSICAL PRESENCE REQUIREMENT TO COLLECT THE USE TAX. THIS DECISION ALSO CREATES MORE OF ELEVEN LEVEL PRAYING BUT PLAYING FIELD. EIGHTY WISE THE PLAYING FIELD BETWEEN CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES WHO MUST COLLECTED TAX IN MANY AT A STATE ONLINE JOB OR NOT. SIMPLY DO NOT BUY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT ALSO COMPLICATED -- ONE WHICH WE HAVE MUCH TO LEARN WHICH IS WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY TO BE ABLE TO LEARN MORE. AND DO BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO BE THE FIRST IN A FEW JOINT HEARINGS AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN AGAIN JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU SO MUCH TO THE CHAIRMAN FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER. WITH THAT -- AND THIS WILL BE THE FIRST OF HEARINGS AS WELL STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SO. FOR EVERYONE'S COMFORT AND EASE OF MIND I'M WITH THAT LET'S START WITH SAID CHRISTINE FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY. THANK YOU -- YES I'M SET KIRSTEN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND HAVE GET A HAND OUT TO ACCOMPANY MY TESTIMONY AVAILABLE BOTH ON PAPER AND ON OUR WEBSITE. OF THIS PRESENTATION WILL BE A HIGH LEVEL INTRODUCTION WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT SUBSEQUENT SPEAKERS WILL GO INTO GREATER DEPTH IN THEIR AREAS OF EXPERTISE. SAW START ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND -- WITH A VERY BRIEF OVERVIEW OF CALIFORNIA SALES AND USE TAX. THIS IS A TAX THAT MANY PEOPLE KNOW SIMPLY AS SALES TAX BUT IT'S ACTUALLY TAX WITH. TWO COMPLEMENTARY PIECES THE FIRST ON GOOD SOLD BY RETAILERS IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE SECOND PART IS A USE TAX ON GOODS PURCHASED FROM OTHER RETAILERS. IN THE TWENTY SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN FISCAL YEAR TAXPAYERS PAID A TOTAL OF FIFTY THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN SALES AND USE TAX AND ALL OF THAT FIFTY THREE BILLION TOTAL. ABOUT TWENTY FIVE BILLION WENT TO THE STATE'S GENERAL FUND -- WITH WHICH MAKES THE SALES AND USE TAX THE SECOND BIGGEST GENERAL FUND REVENUE SOURCE AFTER THE PERSONAL INCOME TAX. THE REMAINING SALES AND USE TAX REVENUE GOES TO A VARIETY OF FUNDS THAT SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS. THE SALES AND USE TAX RATE VARIES QUITE A BIT ACROSS CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA JUST AS IT DOES IN MOST OTHER STATES. DEPENDING ON THE JURISDICTION -- TAXABLE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ONE OF ABOUT TWO DOZEN DISTINCT RATES. THE LOWEST RATE IS SEVEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT AND THE HIGHEST RATE IS TEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT WITH AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT EIGHT AND A HALF PERCENT. THE DEPARTMENT CURRENTLY RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING THE SALES AND USE TAX IS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION OR CD TFA. CITY TFA IS A NEW DEPARTMENT CREATED BY A LAW PASSED LAST YEAR -- THIS DEPARTMENT INHERITED MOST OF THE TAX ADMINISTRATION RESPONSIBILITIES FORMERLY ASSIGNED TO THE STATE BOARD OF EQUALIZATION. SO NOW TURNING TO THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. ALL THE OF A LITTLE BIT DEEPER INTO A POINT THAT I KIND OF GLOSSED OVER RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING -- WHEN CALIFORNIANS BUY GOODS FROM STORES ARE OTHER RETAILERS LOCATED HERE IN CALIFORNIA? THOSE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SALES TAX BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF INSTANCES IN WHICH PEOPLE LIVING HERE IN CALIFORNIA. MAKE VERY SIMILAR PURCHASES STATE OR REMOTE SELLERS IN THOSE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY ARE SUBJECT TO USE TAX SYSTEM EXAMPLES OF USE TAX LIABILITY INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE. OF WHAT THE MAIN FOCUS OF THIS HEARING IS IT IS AS I UNDERSTAND IT BUYING ITEMS ONLINE FROM RETAILERS LOCATED OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA. THERE'S SOME OTHER EXAMPLES FOR EXAMPLE -- WHEN CALIFORNIANS TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF THE STATE BY TAXABLE GOODS AND BRING THEM BACK IN THE CALIFORNIA TO USE THAT ALSO IS -- IS AN EVENT THAT TRIGGERS USE TAX LIABILITY AND THEN THERE'S A THIRD EXAMPLE OF USE TAX THAT DOESN'T COME TO MIND TOO OFTEN BUT THAT'S NGUYEN INDIVIDUAL SELL USED CARS TO ONE ANOTHER -- THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY GEOGRAPHIC ISSUE THEY'RE BOTH PARTIES COULD BE LOCATED RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT PEOPLE WHO SELL THINGS ONLY ON RARE OCCASIONS OFTEN DON'T NEED TO REGISTER AS SELLERS TO PAY SALES TAX ON THE NOSE AND INSTANCES. WHOEVER IS PURCHASING THAT USED CAR WILL OF USE TAX. SO GOING BACK TO THOSE FIRST TWO EXAMPLES WHERE THERE'S A PURCHASE FROM OUT OF STATE. ARE THE DIFFICULTIES INVOLVED IN GETTING CONSUMERS TO PAY THE TAX THAT THEY OWE. ON THEIR PURCHASES ARE PROBABLY READILY APPARENT TO YOU SO A COMMON STRATEGY THAT STATES USE TO INCREASE USE TAX COMPLIANCE IS TO FIND WAYS TO COLLECT THAT TAX FROM THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE SELLING THE TAXABLE GOODS RATHER THAN. FROM THE CONSUMERS THAT ARE BUYING THEM. SO THEN THE LEGAL QUESTION THAT COMES UP THERE IS HOW CAN STATES DO THAT WITHOUT BURDENING INTERSTATE COMMERCE. TO A DEGREE THAT VIOLATES THE IT'S CONSTITUTION AND THAT'S BROADLY SPEAKING WHAT THE WAY FOR DECISION WAS ALL ABOUT. BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO THAT LET'S TAKE A QUICK LOOK BACK AT WHAT WHAT HAPPENED PRIOR TO WAY FAIR SO ON PAGE THREE OF THE HANDOUT. WE HIGHLIGHT TWO CENTRAL CONCEPTS IN COMMERCE CLAUSE JURISPRUDENCE WITH REGARD TO STATE TAXES -- SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS AND PHYSICAL PRESENCE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS IS ONE PART OF FOUR PART TEST USED. TO DETERMINE OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES WHETHER A STATE TAX UNDULY BURDENS INTERSTATE COMMERCE AND FOR THIS AND FOR THE TAX TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL. THE TAXED ACTIVITY MUST HAVE. A SO CALLED SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS WITH THE TAXING STATE ALL DEFERRED OTHERS SPEAKERS ON THERE INVOLVING PRECISE LEGAL MEANING OF THAT TERM -- THE SECOND KEY CONCEPTS. FOR UNDERSTANDING WAY FAIR IS PHYSICAL PRESENCE SO BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO IN THE LANDMARK WILL DECISION FOR EXAMPLE THE SUPREME COURT RULED. THAT A STATE COULD NOT TAX BUSINESSES THAT HAD NO PHYSICAL PRESENCE WITHIN THAT STATE. SO BACK IN TWENTY ELEVEN OPERATING WITHIN THAT PHYSICAL PRESENCE FRAMEWORK OF THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED A LAW AB ONE FIFTY FIVE OF TWENTY ELEVEN THAT EXPANDED THE SET OF BUSINESSES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO COLLECT. USE TAX ON BEHALF OF THEIR CUSTOMERS IN PARTICULAR AB ONE FIFTY FIVE EXTENDED THIS REQUIREMENT TO TWO TYPES OF BUSINESSES. OTHER FIRST TYPE WERE REMOTE SELLERS THAT A SPEAKING PART OF THE SAME -- CORPORATE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AS IN STATE BUSINESSES AND THEN THE SECOND -- TYPE WAS REMOTE SELLERS WHO WORK WITH AFFILIATES THAT ARE LOCATED WITHIN THE STATE PEOPLE WHO WERE FOR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS TO THOSE REMOTE SELLERS. SO THEN PAGE FOUR OF THE HANDOUT. DISPLAYS. THE REVENUE COLLECTED FROM BUSINESSES REGISTERED UNDER AB ONE ONE FIFTY FIVE AS A SHARE. OF TOTAL SALES AND USE TAX REVENUE. AND SO THE GRAPH. FAIRLY SIMPLE ONE BUT IT ILLUSTRATES A COUPLE THINGS WORTH NOTING OFF FIRST ALTHOUGH AB ONE FIFTY FIVE REVENUE IS BY NO MEANS TRIVIAL IT'S A RELATIVELY SMALL SHARE AT THIS TIME OF OVERALL SALES AND USE TAX. THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD DISPLAYED IT'S LESS THAN ONE AND A HALF PERCENT. OF THE SECOND THING IS THAT AB ONE FIFTY FIVE REVENUE. HAS BEEN GROWING AT A FASTER RATE THAN OTHER SALES AND USE TAX REVENUE AND AS SUCH IT REPRESENTS THOUGH A SMALL CERTAINLY AN INCREASING SHARE OF THE TOTAL OVER TIME. AND TURNING TO THE FIFTH AND FINAL PAGE OF THE HANDOUT. WE HAVE A VERY BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE WAY FOR DECISION THAT I BELIEVE WILL BE DISCUSSED IN GREATER DETAIL BY OTHERS SPEAKERS. ARE SUGGEST IS VERY BRIEF BACKGROUND A COUPLE YEARS AGO SOUTH DAKOTA PASSED A LAW. REQUIRING REMOTE SELLERS TO PAY TAXES IF THEY EXCEED EITHER OF TWO ANNUAL THRESHOLDS A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF GROSS REVENUE FROM SALES INTO SOUTH DAKOTA. OR TWO HUNDRED OR MORE SEPARATE SALES TRANSACTIONS INTO THE STATE -- SOME REMOTE SELLERS REFUSED TO COMPLY WITH THE NEW LAW SIR SOUTH DAKOTA TOOK THEM TO COURT. AND THE LOWER COURTS RULED IN FAVOR OF THE REMOTE SELLERS DUE TO THEIR LACK OF PHYSICAL PRESENCE WITHIN SOUTH DAKOTA. THEN THE US SUPREME COURT DECISION -- GOT RID OF THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE REQUIREMENT AND VACATED THE LOWER COURT RULINGS. AND THEN ABSENT THAT PHYSICAL PRESENCE REQUIREMENT THE SUPREME COURT RULED THAT THE SOUTH DAKOTA LINE DOES MEET THE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS REQUIREMENT AND DOES NOT UNDULY BURDEN INTERSTATE COMMERCE. IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. WE'LL BE DISCUSSING THE LEGAL SUBSTANCES DETAIL US THAT CONCLUDES MY PRESENTATION AND AT THIS TIME I'D BE HAPPY. TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE FOR ME [inaudible] ANYONE. WE KNEW CENTER MARKET HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS. I THINK YES DON'T. WE'RE GOING TO SAVE MOST OF OUR SOME OF OUR QUESTIONS FOR THAT FOR THE NEXT BIGGER WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE LEGAL BACKGROUND OF THE DECISION AND SOME OF ITS IMPLICATIONS BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. NEXT WE HAVE AND THAT NOW IN. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. I HAVE A LOT OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU WELCOME TO COMMITTING PLEASE PROCEED. I GOOD AFTERNOON HOW ARE THE GERMAN BURKE CHEN MCGUIRE OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEES HERE AND STAFF OF THANK YOU THE OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT THIS IMPORTANT CASE. A IT IS A A MAJOR LANDMARK CASE HERE AND YOU'VE GOT A LINE OF MY REMARKS HERE. BASICALLY THIS WAY FAIR CASE IS LISTEN AFRICAN CASE IN THAT THE COURT DID OVERTURN FIFTY ONE YEARS OF PRIOR PRESIDENT WHICH IS NOT A COMMON THING FOR THE SUPREME COURT TO DO. A BASICALLY SAYING THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE RULE OF QUILL WHICH DATED BACK TO NINETEEN NINETY TWO IS UNSOUND AND IN CORRECT THAT'S A A MAJOR HAD HIT TO THAT THAT CASE. OF THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE STANDARD SHOULD NOT BE THE STANDARD FOR THE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS FIRST PART OF THE FOUR PART TEST OF COMPLETE AUTO TRANSIT. THEY WERE JUST LOOKING AT THIS COMPLETE AUTO TRANSIT CASING PHYSICAL PRESENCE BASICALLY WAS JUST TOO LIMITING OF A STANDARD AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT OF HIGH MENTION AGAIN AS I GO THROUGH MY REMARKS THAT. WHILE WE MIGHT THINK WAS IT ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT BECAUSE THE COURT TO ADVANCE TO THIS POINT IT REALLY WASN'T THEY WERE SAYING EVEN BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IN QUILL WHEN THEY DECIDED PHYSICAL PRESENCE THERE PROBABLY WERE JUST BEING TOO NARROW AT THAT POINT -- AS WELL SO FAR AS WHAT COULD POSSIBLY BE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS. SOUTH DAKOTA SALES TAX COLLECTION REQUIREMENTS -- THAT THEY FOUND PROTECTS INTERSTATE COMMERCE FISHING NEXUS BASED ON BOTH ECONOMIC AND VIRTUAL CONTACT. THAT THE SELLERS HAVE WITH THE STATE AND THEY DO HIGHLIGHT THREE FEATURES OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA LAW ACROSS THE SOUTH DAKOTA LAW WAS PURPOSELY ENACTED THE TRYING TO GET A CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT. THE CHALLENGE THE QUILL CASE BECAUSE AN EARLIER DECISION JUSTICE KENNEDY HAD HINTED THAT IT WAS TIME TO OVERTURN QUILTS THE SEVERAL STATES ARE VERY EAGER TO GET THEIR CASE THERE. AND SOUTH DAKOTA LAW HAD IT A SYSTEM WHERE IT COULD GET THAT MOVING FAIRLY QUICKLY. OF THESE THREE FEATURES I WILL COME BACK TO THIS WAS -- THERE WAS A SAFE HARBOR FOR LIMITED BUSINESS ACTIVITY. THERE WAS NO RETRO. APPLICATION OF SOUTH DAKOTA IS CHANGING ITS SALES TAX STANDARD AND THERE WAS A SYSTEM IN SOUTH DAKOTA TO REDUCE ADMINISTRATIVE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. SO WE NEED TO BE AWARE THAT THE SUPREME COURT DID NOT SAY WELL HERE IS THE STANDARD IT JUST SAID THAT THE SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD WAS WITHIN THOSE GUIDELINES -- JUST ONE INTERESTING POINT -- IF INSTEAD OF LIKE A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD HAVE BEEN A FIFTY THOUSAND OUR THRESHOLD THAT HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE WE DON'T REALLY DOUBTS ARE A LOT OF QUESTIONS -- WHICH AND WAS WHILE YOU'RE HOLDING THIS HEARING AS TO WHAT THIS CASE ARE REALLY MEANS. I DO WANT TO STRESS BUT I HAVE A UNFORTUNATE TYPO HIM THE FIRST PAGE OF MY OUTLINED ALL REMOTE SELLERS CAN BE SUBJECT TO A STATE'S TAXES. A WE'RE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GET EVERY SELLER -- WHO DOESN'T HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE TO COLLECT TAX WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE STANDARD IS -- BUT SOLELY THEY'D MADE IT CLEAR THAT SOME LIMITED BUSINESS ACTIVITY WOULD EXCUSE SOMEBODY FROM HAVING TO PAY -- TO COLLECT SALES TAX THAT IT'D BE BANNED THE CASE ACTUALLY BACK TO THE SOUTH DAKOTA SUPREME COURT SO THEY COULD DâN RULE BASED ON THE NEW STANDARD THAT THE SUPREME COURTHAD HAD LAID OUT SO WE WE ARE WAITING HERE WHAT HAPPENS THERE. THIS REALLY IS A VERY SIGNIFICANT DECISION AS I NOTED OVERTURNED FIFTY ONE YEARS OF STATE TAX PRESIDENT OF THAT INCLUDED THE UP TO THE QUILL CASE FROM. NINETEEN NINETY TWO AND THE WHOLE CASE WAS A MAJOR CASE BECAUSE IT HAD CLARIFIED AND WENT A STEP BEYOND WHAT THE BELLAS HAS CASE. HAD ALLOWED A FEW DECADES EARLIER. IN THE BELLAS HAS CASE THEY PRETTY MUCH SAID FOR BOTH DUE PROCESS IAN COMMERCE CLAUSE PURPOSES YOU HAVE TO HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE. AND IN THAT BILLS HAS CASE THEY WERE STRESSING THAT YOU KNOW THERE WOULD BE SOME BURDEN ON THE GO SMALL VENDORS THAT THEY HAD TO COULD BE COLLECTING TAX BECAUSE EVEN ENVELOPES HAS DECADES AGO THEY NOTED. THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS IN THE U. S. B. THE COUNT THE STATE'S IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT CAN ASSESS SALES TAX. SO WHEN. CIVIL DECADES GO ON AND THE COURTS AS PERHAPS WRONG WE CAN SEE FOR ALL THIS GROWTH AND SALES THAT'S WHAT THE QUILL AND TO GET TO THE COURT IN A QUILL FOR EXAMPLE WAS. THE SIXTH LARGEST OFFICE SUPPLY SELLER IN NORTH DAKOTA BUT HAD NO PHYSICAL PRESENCE THAT THEY WOULD JUST MAIL CATALOGS THERE AND THEY WOULD GET A LOT OF BUSINESS OF THE STATE'S THEY WERE CONCERNED. AND IT WAS TIME TO LOOK AT BALLOTS HAS AGAIN BUT WHEN THE SUPREME COURT NINETEEN YOU TO LOOK AT THE QUILL DECISION. THEY SAID YET MAYBE THINGS HAVE CHANGED AND WE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY SEPARATING OUR ANALYSIS OF THE DUE PROCESS CLAUSE AND THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. AND I THINK THAT THE PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THE COURT SAID WAS IF YOU LOOK AT DUE PROCESS FOR LOOKING AT THE INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER IS IT FAIR TO ASSESS. OUR LAWS ON THAT TAX PAYER NAY TH THOUGHT THAT IF YOU ARE PURPOSELY AVAILING YOURSELF OF THE MARKET IN THAT STATE THAT WAS ENOUGH FOR DUE PROCESS. BUT IN QUILTS A FORCE COMMERCE CLAUSE IS THAT WE LOOK AT THE WHOLE MARKET NOT JUST THE EFFECT ON THAT ONE TAXPAYER AND EFFECTIVE THE WHOLE MARKET IS YOU KNOW THERE ARE OVER SIX THOUSAND TAXING JURISDICTIONS AT ALL HAVE DIFFERENT RULES AND DEFINITIONS AND FILING PROCEDURES AND THAT COULD. IMPEDE INTERSTATE COMMERCE SO WE THINK THE BETTER STANDARD WOULD BE YOU HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE. AND THAT WAS THOUGHT OF AS BEING A BRIGHT LINE TEST THOUGH THE REALITY IS AS PEOPLE START THINKING ABOUT IT AND LOOKING AT A VARIETY OF FACT PATTERNS WHAT EXACTLY IS A PHYSICAL PRESENCE FOR EXAMPLE IF SOMEONE SENDS AN EMPLOYEE INTO A STATE FOR TWO DAYS TO HELP INSTALL. SOME EQUIPMENT WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A PHYSICAL PRESENCE THERE WAS A FAIR AMOUNT LOCATION AFTER COIL -- AS TO WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A PHYSICAL PRESENCE AND THE RULING STILL NESTLE. GOV ARE THE SAME THEY ARE THE SAME FROM STATE TO STATE UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN BRING THAT DEFINITION IS OF PHYSICAL PRESENCE AS WAS DESCRIBED EARLIER LIKE IN THE AB ONE FIFTY FIVE AND MANY AMAZON TYPE CLICK THROUGH LAWS THAT MANY STATES -- HAD ENACTED -- FOR SO FAR AS THE OTHER QUILL BEING YOU KNOW THIS MAJOR -- DECISION BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO THAT CASE DID SHAPE OF BUSINESS DECISIONS WERE MANY BUSINESSES CERTAINLY WERE TRYING TO AVOID A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE I THINK IS THE COMMERCE GREW YOU COULD SEE. PRICE COMPETITION WOULD BE WHY THEY WANT TO AVOID THAT BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK YOU KNOW AMAZONS A BIG COMPANY WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL COLLECTING SALES TAX IT WAS A PRICE COMPETITION I THINK. BUT THAT'S ALSO SOMETHING AWAY FAIR MAJORITY WAS POINTING OUT THAT THEY'RE WORSE LIKE. LIKE A TAX SHELTER BEING CREATED BY A BY THE QUILL DECISION. SUPPORTERS OF WHAT WILL BE THE EFFECT OF WHEY FAIR OF NOW SAYING WILL THAT QUILL PHYSICAL PRESENCE THAT'S NIGHT NOT THE RIGHT STANDARD. THIS IS GOING TO ALSO HAVE AN EFFECT ON YOU COMMERCE IN MANY AN UNKNOWN WAYS FOR EXAMPLE SOME VENDORS MIGHT DECIDE THEY'RE NOT GOING TO ENGAGE IN E. COMMERCE OR AS MUCH YOU COMMERCE. I DO NOTE YOUR NECKLACE ONLY BE VENDORS LOCATED IN CALIFORNIA SELLING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA MIGHT WANT TO RESTRICT THEIR ACTIVITY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO HAVE THE COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER STATES SO. WHAT THE EFFECT ON E. COMMERCE WERE STILL WAIT TO SEE WHAT THE EFFECT IS ON ON WAY FAIR AND WHAT ALL THE STATES ARE GONNA DO IN RESPONSE? TO THE WAY FAIR CASE -- THEY'LL CERTAINLY BE AFFECTS ON CONSUMERS I THINK THE WAY FAIR CASE WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT YES THERE ACTUALLY IS SALES TAX WHEN YOU BUY SOMETHING THAT STANGEL PERSONAL PROPERTY IN CALIFORNIA EVEN IF YOU WERE NOT CHARGED IT BY THE VENDOR -- I WOULD BE SURPRISED IF MAYBE THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COULD TAKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUSH HEY NO GUESS WHAT THERE WAS A SALES TAX MAYBE JUST WANNA BY LOCAL AS OPPOSED -- TO BUYING FROM. FROM OUTSIDE THE THE EFFECT OF THE DIFFICULT DECISION HAD A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE SHAPE OF STATE TAX SYSTEMS THE STATE'S REPLACE THAT LOST REVENUE PERHAPS WITH OTHER REVENUE. NOW -- YES WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE OWE USE TAX BUT AS THE IN THE SUPREME COURT POINTED OUT ONLY ABOUT 4% OF USE TAX DOES CUT GET COLLECTED -- I'D LIKE TO THINK MAYBE THE PERCENTAGE IS HIGHER IN IN CALIFORNIA WITH A FEW THINGS THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO TRY TO INCREASE STEP IS STILL PRETTY LOW PERCENTAGE AND YOU CAN SEE FROM. A SOME OF THE DATA BEING PROVIDED TODAY BY OTHER SPEAKERS THAT. OF THAT UNCOLLECTED USE TAX IT'S NOT OLD BUSINESS TO CONSUMER IT'S ALSO BUSINESS THE BUSINESS HIS BUSINESS IS NOT TO SAY COLLECTING USED TAX AS WELL. THE THE EFFECT ON THE STATE AND LOCAL TAXES OF THE WAY FOR DECISION WILL FOR THE AFFECT STATE AND LOCAL REVENUES AND SOME BUSINESSES BEYOND SALES TAX. THIS NEW DISA VALANCE OF A PHYSICAL PRESENCE STANDARD THAT'S NECESSARY FOR HAVING COMMERCE CLAUSE NEXUS. DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO SALES TAX SEXUAL PLIES TO ALL TYPES OF TAXES IS A SOMETHING ELSE TO BE BE THINKING ABOUT ANY RELEVANCE TO WHAT INCOME AND THE OTHER TAXES HERE -- AND THEN I ALSO HAVE. IN ANOTHER BESIDE THE OUTLINE I HAD ARTICLES PUBLISHED TODAY TALKING ABOUT SOME MORE STAKEHOLDER -- CONCERNS THE GILMORE TO THE IN THE WAY FAIR CASE WAS A FIVE FOUR DECISIONS OF A OF A CLOSE DECISION BEGIN OVERTURNING FIFTY YEARS A PRESIDENT'S IS A BIG DEAL. THE COURT DID CONCLUDE THAT THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE WILL OF QUILL IS ON SOUND AND IN CORRECT. AND AGAIN THE KEY FAXES AND TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SOUTH DAKOTA ALONG WITH THAT THE OTHER STATES TRYING TO CHALLENGE GETTING A CASE TO THE SUPREME COURT BECAUSE THEY WERE. TIRED OF WAITING FOR CONGRESS TO TAKE ACTION AND I'VE DONE THIS A BLAME CONGRESS FOR NOT TAKING ACTION BECAUSE THEY WERE HEARING ONE THING FROM STATES AND% SEVERAL THINGS FROM FROM VENDORS. BUT COULD NOT STOP THE CODE ENACTED S. ONE OH SIX TO REQUIRE CERTAIN REMOTE SELLERS TO COLLECT SALES TAX THEY CALL THAT EMERGENCY LEGISLATION DUE TO A NEED FOR REVENUE. SELLERS REQUIRED TO ACT AS IF THEY TAX IF ON THE ANNUAL BASIS THEY DELIVERED OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF GOODS OR SERVICES INTO THE STATE. OR HAD TWO HUNDRED OR MORE TRANSACTIONS OF IN STATE DELIVERIES AND THIS CHANGE APPLIES PROSPECTIVELY WITH THAT THE LADY PENDING A SHOWING OF CONSTITUTIONALITY. A SOUTH DAKOTA BROAD ACTION AGAINST THREE SELLERS I I DO WANT EMPHASIZE THAT THESE THREE SELLERS WASTE WAYFAIR OVERSTOCK DOT COM AND NEWEGG. EACH HAVE ANNUAL REVENUE OF OVER BILLION DOLLARS THESE WERE LARGE VENDORS BUT THEY DID NOT HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN SOUTH DAKOTA SO WE'RE NOT -- COLLECTING. OF THE SOUTH DAKOTA LOST IN THE STATE COURTS BECAUSE OF THE QUILL DECISION AND EVENTUALLY THIS THEY'D PETITION TO THE SUPREME COURT THE SUPREME COURT DECIDED TO TAKE THE CASE AND I DO ALSO WANT TO NOTE THAT. AS THIS -- DIFFERENCE BEEN COURT TODAY TAKE THE CASE THERE WAS A LITTLE OVER FIFTY AMICUS BRIEFS FILED WHICH PROVIDE A LOT MORE BACKGROUND OF PEOPLE OF FROM VARIOUS STAKEHOLDER GROUPS WHETHER THEY'RE LIKE EBAY AT SEA STATES OF THE US GOVERNMENT. OTHERS AND PROVIDE A GOOD NUMBER BACKGROUND SO FAR AS CONCERNS THEY HAVE WITH WHAT HAPPENED IF A QUILL WAS TO BE CHANGED. ON THE U. S. SUPREME COURT HELD A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IS THE WRONG STANDARD FOR COMMERCE CLAUSE AND SALES TAX NEXUS PURPOSES THEY GO THROUGH A REVIEW OF EVEN OLD COMMERCE CLAUSE JURISDICTION DATING BACK TO THE EARLY EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS. A BUT THEY DO STILL TALK ABOUT THE COMPLETE COMPLETE AUTO TRANSIT VERSUS BRADY -- IS STILL A VALID STANDARD THEY JUST SAID HOW WE HAD INTERPRETED THAT FIRST PART OF THAT FOUR PART TEST AS YELLED THAT APPLIES -- TO AND WITH SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS WITH THE STATE THAT JUST SHOULD NOT BE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE OF STANDARD THERE. ARE THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE THEY SAID WAS CONTRARY TO MODERN COMMERCE CLAUSE APPLICATION AND IS ARBITRARY FORMALISTIC MEASURE IT DOES NOT PUT BUSINESSES ON AN EVEN PLAYING FIELD AS IT DOES NOT CONSIDER THE SIZE OF BUSINESSES AND IMPOSES A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE FOR BUSINESSES. WITH A PHYSICAL PRESENCE COMPARED TO NON PRESENT SELLERS SO AGAIN THEY WEREN'T AS A SIGNING WAS ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY THAT CALLS AND TO GET THIS NEW INTERPRETATION OF WHAT'S COMMERCE CLAUSE JURISDICTION AS IT WAS THEY JUST THOUGHT EVEN BACK IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO IT WASN'T LIKE A FAIR STANDARD. THAT THEY HAD PUT IN PLACE A TO FORMALISTIC AND NOT NOT. ARE THEY ALSO DO KNOW THOUGH THAT TECHNOLOGY USED ANY COMMERCE HAS GIVEN RISE THE NEW TYPES OF CONNECTIONS BETWEEN A RETAILER IN A STATE. AND A VIRTUAL SHOW ROOM CAN SHOW FOR MORE INVENTORY AND FOR MORE DETAIL AND WITH GREATER OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSUMER AND SELLER INTERACTION IT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE FOR LOCAL STORES. THEY'RE SAYING IS EVEN A RICHER CONNECTION YOU COULD HAVE WITH YOUR CUSTOMERS IN ECON RESCIND VARMINT WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL PRESENCE AGAIN CHALLENGING WHAT SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS. DOES A RULE THAT IGNORE THE SUBSTANTIAL VIRTUAL CONNECTIONS THE STATE SHOULD NOT BE RETAINED. THE DISSENTERS IN THE CASE SAID WILL IT MUCH BETTER IF THE CONGRESS WOULD RESULT THESE ISSUES OF COURSE THINK SOME RELUCTANCE TO OVERTURN ALL THIS PRESIDENT. BUT THE MAJORITY RESPONDED TO THAT SAYING IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH THE COURTS PROPER ROLE TO ASK CONGRESS TO ADDRESS A FALSE CONSTITUTIONAL PREMISE OF THIS COURT'S OWN CREATION. IT IS CURRENTLY THE COURT AND NOT CONGRESS THAT IS LIMITING THE LAWFUL PROVIDENCE OF THE STATE'S. SO AGAIN ALL THE COURT HELD WAS YES PHYSICAL PRESENCE IS NOT THE STANDARD -- FOR ANY KIND OF TAX NEXUS AND IT SAID WELL WHAT IS A OKAY STANDARD THAT'S NOT GONNA VIOLATE THE COMMERCE CLAUSE THEY SAID WELL SOUTH DAKOTA WHICH IS THE LAW BEFORE US THEIR SB A ONE OH SIX THAT'S ALL WE CAN EVALUATE WHAT THE SOUTH DAKOTA. THE CALENDAR YEAR WHETHER THE THE PAST CALENDAR YEAR OR THE CURRENT CALENDAR YEAR IF YOU HAD MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OF SALES AND TO THE STATE OR TWO HUNDRED OR MORE TRANSACTIONS. THAT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SAY YOU HAD SALES TAX COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS THERE AND THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THAT THE SOUTH DAKOTA LAW WAS NOT RETROACTIVE. AND THEY ALSO POINTED OUT THAT SOUTH DAKOTA WAS A MEMBER OF THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX -- AGREEMENT WHICH HAD SOME SIMPLIFICATIONS AND IT SUCH AS SOME STANDARD DEFINITIONS AT LEAST AMONG THE MEMBER STATES AND IT HAD SOME OF THE PROTECTION FOR THE REMOTE SELLERS SUCH AS THE STATES ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE TO THE REMOTE SELLERS. AND AT NO COST TO THE REMOTE SELLERS AND IT DOES REMOTE SELLERS USE THAT SOFTWARE THEY ALSO GET AUDIT PROTECTION. SO THEY DID STRESS THAT AGAIN THAT'S YOUR THINK YOU KNOW HOW COULD. OTHER STATES GO AND SAY WHAT CAN WE MATCH SOUTH DAKOTA LAW. PROBABLY MATCHING THE FIRST PART THE HUNDRED THOUSAND THE TUNER TRANSACTIONS AND THE NOT RETROACTIVE THAT'S PRETTY EASY TO DO BUT WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT CALIFORNIA AND MANY STATES RETCHING NOT MEMBERS OF THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX. SO THAT'S GOING TO BE A CHALLENGE AS TO WHAT CAN WE DO TO SAY. THE COURT IF THEY LOOKED AT ARES WOULD SAY YES CAL THE THERE. SO FAR AS YOUR STATE CONSIDERATIONS IT REALLY IS AS YOU KNOW WHAT EXACTLY DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR STATE [inaudible] AND I DO LIST OF RIGHTY OF OF CONSIDERATIONS HERE -- FOR THE STATE TO NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT HERE -- AS TO HOW IMPORTANT IS THAT WE ARE OR NOT IN THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX YOU MIGHT THINK WELL MAYBE THAT WOULD BE AN EASY THING TO DO THOUGH I THINK WE PROBABLY WANT TO LOOK VERY CAREFULLY AT THAT BECAUSE ONE THING ABOUT THE GOVERNING BOARD THE STREAMLINED. SALES AND USE TAX AGREEMENT IT'S ONE VOTE PER STATE. ALMOND FOR EXAMPLE A SOUTH DAKOTA HAS LESS THAN A MILLION POPULATION WE'VE GOT FORTY MILLION -- POPULATION HERE. I'M ALSO HOW SHOULD ANY MEASURE OF GROSS RECEIPTS SUPPLY DEMAND AND WE SHOULDN'T THING VIEW ALL THE SOUTH DAKOTA LAWS CAN BE VERY STRAIGHT FORWARD. OF HOW DO YOU HAVE ACTUALLY MEASURE A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF SALES IS THAT LOOKING AT ALL TRANSACTIONS JUST TAXABLE ONES -- WHAT WOULD BE A SIMPLE WAY TO DEAL WITH THAT -- IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT AVOIDING FUTURE LITIGATION WHAT ABOUT THIS THRESHOLD OF TWO HUNDRED OR LESS TRANSACTIONS IN THE STATE. THAT WASN'T THE CASE THAT WAS A FOR THE COURT BUT THAT COULD BE TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS OF A DOLLAR EACH -- I SAID I WOULD PROJECTED THAT'S GOING TO LEAD TO FUTURE LITIGATION THE STATES THAT ARE ADOPTING OF THAT STANDARD. ALSO WE WANT TO BE ADDRESSING. WHEN DOES NEXUS START WHEN DOES IT END WHAT IF SOMEONE SALES DROP BELOW THAT THAT THRESHOLD THERE ARE MANY THINGS TO CONSIDER -- SO THE ANY CHANGE WERE DOING IN CALIFORNIA CLEAR AS POSSIBLE WHEN YOU DO AND DO NOT HAVE HAVE NEXUS. IS BY THE BEST WAY TO GO SO FAR AS AVOIDING FUTURE LITIGATION AND ENSURING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE -- A PROPER AND HOPEFULLY SIMPLE COMPLIANCE. AS TO WHAT AT ALSO WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT'S THE EFFECT ON LOCAL GOVERNMENT. MINUTES LOCAL OVER THE FOR COULD SAY HEY PHYSICAL PRESENCE YOU'VE GOTTA COLLECT HERE THAT WAS PRETTY STRAIGHT FORWARD WHAT WILL BE THE MEASURE NOW. AND COURSE AT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT LETTER LEVEL WE DO HAVE VARYING SOURCING APPROACHES IN THAT THE DISTRICT TAX GOES ON A DESTINATION SOURCING AND THE SALES TAX GOES ON THE ORIGIN SOURCING WHICH CAN. AS WE CHANGE A NEXUS STANDIFER LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAVE SOME IMPACT PERHAPS TO OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND HOW THAT SHOULD BE EXPLAINED. AS THE WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE NEXUS STANDARD GIVEN NOT ONLY THE WAY FAIR DECISION BUT ENFORCEMENT CONSIDERATIONS AND REALITIES. AGAIN SOUTH DAKOTA HAD A POPULATION OF EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THOUSAND WE HAVE FORTY MILLION THAT MEANS IF WE WERE TO ADOPT THE SOUTH DAKOTA THRESHOLD AT THE HUNDRED THOUSAND SALES INTERNET OR MORE TRANSACTIONS. WE WOULD HAVE FAR MORE REMOTE SELLERS AND SOUTH DAKOTA WILL BECAUSE WE HAVE FAR MORE CONSUMERS -- IN THIS STATE SO. UPSET BE A NEED TO BE CONSIDERING HOW TO ALSO FAIRNESS CAN ALL VENDORS THE SUBJECT TO COLLECTION DURING NEW STANDARD BE TREATED SIMILARLY IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT MEAN IF TO SAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE A CERTAIN ENFORCEMENT FOR THOSE WE CAN EASILY REACH IN THE STATE. AND THOSE OUTSIDE THE STATE WE MIGHT NOT HAVE THE SAME ENFORCEMENT COULD BE -- A CONCERN THERE. ALSO COURSE UNDER REVENUE TAXATION SIXTY TWO OR THREE SEE IT DOES ALSO LOOK LIKE MAYBE THE VENDOR SHOULD JUST START COLLECTING BECAUSE IT SAYS YOU ARE CONSIDERED A VENDOR -- IN THIS A RETAILER ENGAGED IN BUSINESS IN THE STATE IF YOU MEET THE SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS AS THE FINE BY THE CONSTITUTION WHICH IS A CREAM COURT JUST TO FIND -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE CHALLENGING TO SOON VENDORS WOULD JUST START OF START DOING THAT. AS WELL AS STATES ARE DOING MANY STATES SEEM TO BE GOING WITH THE SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD AND EVEN MAKING EFFECTIVE PERHAPS YOU'D LIKE TO OCTOBER FIRST NOVEMBER FIRST. I THINK ALSO HAS TO BE CONSIDERATION OF HOW QUICKLY CAN A VENDOR START COLLECTING HOW QUICKLY CAN THE CD TFA HELP THAT VENDOR GET COMPLIANT AND INTO THE SYSTEM -- SO YOU KNOW THE SPACE THAT SOMEBODY JUST CROSS THAT THRESHOLD AND NOW HAD TO START COLLECTING IS NOT REALLY A A LOT OF TIME TO BE -- TO BE DEALING WITH. A SO IT'S A MANY MANY -- CAN CONSIDERATIONS HERE MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND INVOLVED HERE. ALSO IS IN OF MY FINAL COMMENTS HEARING ON GET. TO KNOW YOUR TO GET THE QUESTIONS BUT I THINK WE ALSO SHOULD BE LIKE TO VIEW THINGS AS AN OPPORTUNITY. PRESS IS ALSO OPPORTUNITY THAN LOOKING AT WHAT THIS WAY FAIR MEAN FOR THE STATE AND DO WE WANT TO BE SPECIFIC ON WHAT THE NEXUS STANDARD WILL BE IN THE STATE THAT WE THINK COULD BE IN LINE WITH THE NEW. CONGRESS CLASS INTERPRETATION FROM THE WAY FAIR CASE BUT IT SHOULD ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OTHER CHANGES TO THE SALES TAX THAT MIGHT OF FURTHER IMPROVE IT -- WE'D WE DO HAVE YOU KNOW A FAIRLY HIGH RATE -- WE HAVE. OF A. B. OTHER RULES NEED TO BE CLARIFIED LCD LOOK AT THIS ANY HOUSES CHANGE THINGS ABOUT DROP SHIPMENT OR OCCASIONAL SALES ANY OTHER CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE -- ADDRESS THEIR ANY OPPORTUNITIES AND AS ALWAYS PROPOSALS PERHAPS TO BROADEN THE BASE TO REMOVE A CERTAIN EXEMPTIONS A TIME FOR LOOKING AT THAT. AND COURSE. WITH ALL THAT COULD BE DONE TOGETHER AS A LOGICAL WAY HE GOT UP WE HAVE A OF AN EFFECTIVE SALES AND USE TAX SYSTEM THAT'S GONNA BE BENEFICIAL TO THE STATE GOVERNMENT. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND THE CONSUMERS AS WELL AS THE BUSINESSES AND AGAIN THE BUSINESSES WE HAVE TO REALIZE THAT THE BUSINESSES THAT ARE GOING TO BE REMOTE HAVING OBLIGATIONS IN THE STATE AS WELL AS OUR OWN VENDORS AND THE STATE. DEALING WITH THE STATE'S THAT THEY HAVE REMOTE SALES AND OUTSIDE OF A CALIFORNIA WHICH ALSO MIGHT. A CALL SOME CONSIDERATION OF SHOULD CONGRESS. TO PUT SOME STANDARD IN PLACE OF SO THERE COULD BE SOME CONSISTENCY FOR ALL VENDORS THROUGHOUT THE THROUGHOUT THE U. S. [inaudible] ON WITHOUT BE GLAD TO TAKE ANY ANY QUESTIONS AND DO MY BEST -- TO ADDRESS THOSE. FIRST THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION IT'S EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND I THINK YOUR PRESENTATION GIVES US MUCH MORE DETAIL AND SHOWS US ALL HOW ACTUALLY TRULY MORE COMPLICATED EVEN THAT MAYBE WE REALIZED IT IS -- I I DO WANT TO ASK A QUESTION I REALIZE THAT AT SOME POINT THE THE NOTION OF A PHYSICAL PRESENT BECAME ANTIQUATED HOWEVER THE THE ISSUE THE REASON THE PHYSICAL PRESENCE -- KIND OF STANDARD CAME ABOUT WAS BECAUSE OF THE COMPLEXITY OF KIND OF OF THE COLD THE COLLECTION OBLIGATION WHICH CLEARLY STILL EXISTS AS IF NOT WORSE NOW THAN WHEN THAT STANDARD WAS PUT INTO PLACE. AND MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS AS LONG AS WE'RE CALIFORNIA'S NOT OF STATUS -- SITUATION AND WE ARE AN ADVISORY STATE WHICH I'M NOT SURE I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THAT MEANS THE WORD RISING ON THE STREAMLINED BUT WERE NOT PART OF IT. WHAT OTHER POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS ARE THERE IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN SOMETHING LIKE THIS? WILL. I GUESS ALSO NO MORE AS WE HEAR WHATEVER THE SOUTH DAKOTA SUPREME COURT SAYS -- BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE FEATURES OF THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX ME ONE WAS EMPHASIZED BY THE COURT WAS THE SOFTWARE BEING PROVIDED TO THE REMOTE VENDORS WITH THE AUDIT PROTECTION THAT'S THAT'S A REALLY GOOD DEAL [inaudible] CALIFORNIA COULD. SIGN ON TO THESE SAME VENDORS AS SEVEN OF SULFUR PROVIDERS THAT THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX OFFERS. CALIFORNIA PERHAPS COULD SAY WELL WE'RE GONNA TAKE THAT FEATURE AND WE'LL DO IT ON OUR OWN AS OTHER OF COURSE OTHER VENDORS AGAIN ALSO OFFER THAT -- SOURCE OF COURSE IT WOULD TAKE FUNDING FOR THAT TO OCCUR SO IT COULD BE -- PROBABLY PRESENTED TO THESE OF VENDORS ALSO THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX DOES HAVE A OF A ONE STOP SHOP SO FAR AS REGISTERING WHEN YOU REGISTER TO STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX. YOU ARE THEN REGISTERED ALL THE MEMBER STATES LETTING IN THOSE STATES -- YOU IF YOU DON'T WANT TO DO THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN STILL REGISTER STATE BY STATE THIS LOT EASIER JUST TO DO THE ONE MASS. SIGNING ON THEIR SHORTLY AFTER THE SUPREME COURT DECISION THE GOVERNING BOARD OF STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX DID HOLD A MEETING WHERE THEY WERE ASKING SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS SHOULD WE LET NON MEMBER STATES COMMENTS AT SOMETHING TO TAKE A LOOK AT ARE THEY GOING TO REALIZE THAT MAYBE. NOT EVERYBODY WANTS TO BE IN THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX WHICH HAS BROUGHT SOME SUPPLICATION BUT NOT. AS SIMPLE AS WE MIGHT THINK IF YOU WERE GO TO THEIR WEBSITE EVERY STATE HAS TO HAVE A TAX ABILITY MATRIX. WHERE MOTHERS COMMON DEFINITIONS THE STATE CAN STILL DECIDE WE WANT TO TAX OR NOT TAXIS COMPANIES TAX ABILITY MATTRESSES ARE FAIRLY COMPLICATED MEAN THE SALES TAX AND THEN YOU CODE ALL YOUR PRODUCTS? TO TIED TO THAT AMOUNTS TO TECHNOLOGY EXISTED DO THAT BUT IT'S MORE THAN JUST THE SOFTWARE YOU DO NEED HUMAN BEINGS TO HELP. OPERATE THAT SORT THERE ARE COSTS INVOLVED IN ALL THAT -- SO YES THERE ARE SOME SUPPLICATIONS THERE BY THINK WE COULD LOOK AT WHAT MIGHT WE STILL BE ABLE TO DO WITHOUT PERHAPS HAVING TO JOIN THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX BUT PROBABLY MONITORING WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE. A DOING WILL THEY BE PUSHING THAT YES OTHER SCANNED. NON MEMBER STATES CAN CAN SIGN ON TO THAT IS PUTTING TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR STATES BELONG TO STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX AND SO I READ YOUR ARTICLE THAT SAYS CALIFORNIA WOULD NEVER JOIN. SAYS THIS IS STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX SO CAN I ASK WHY WHAT ARE YOUR CHARITY I JUST HEAR OPINION OBVIOUSLY I THINK IS THE ONE VOTE PER STATE. AND I I DON'T THINK IT'S HAPPENED RECENTLY BUT STILL YEARS AGO THERE WERE OFTEN CHANGES TO THE AGREEMENT. AND CYCLE HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW CHANGES DO YOU WANT TO THE SIZE OF OUR STATE WILL WE SEE LARGE STAGE JOINING IN -- SOME TODAY MIGHT WONDER WELL HOW IMPORTANT IS TO STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX AGREEMENT NOW THAT WE DON'T HAVE THAT PHYSICAL PRESENCE STANDARD WE COULD JUST SAY HEY IT'S OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND AND TWO OTHER TRANSACTIONS [inaudible] BUT YET IT MEMBER CAN SIGN ON TO VIEW MORE THOSE DEFINITIONS PERHAPS I THINK IT'S STILL BE WORTH LOOKING AT BUT THE ONE VOTE PER STATE IS THAT. SOUNDS TROUBLING BECAUSE I WAS WHICH IS SUCH A LARGE STATE. AND WE'RE FORTY TIMES THE SIZE OF SOUTH DAKOTA. IS THERE WOULD. YES NO. FEEL BUT I THINK ALSO WHAT WHAT THE PERCENTAGE OF SALES TAX COLLECTED UNITED STATES CONSERVE CALIFORNIA RIGHT. THE MUCH HIGHER THAN OUR POPULATION FOR RIGHT RIGHT ALSO IT WAS IT WAS EVEN NOTED THAT SOMEBODY'S LARGE VENDORS ALREADY ARE COLLECTING IN CALIFORNIA THE GAO REPORT THAT CAME OUT LATE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALSO INDICATED. THAT -- NOT I ALWAYS SAY IT NEVER BECAUSE THEY WANT ONE VOTE FOR STATE DOESN'T SOUND LIKE SOMETHING CALIFORNIA OR NEW YORKER -- TEXAS IS GOING TO SIGN ON TO BUT IT'S WORTH MONITORING AS EVERYTHING ELSE IS BEING LOOKED AT AND THEN I DID HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION THEM PASSING ON IT ARE NOT REALLY A QUESTION BUT JUST A COMMENT THAT I WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE IS. AWARE OF AND UNDERSTANDS THAT THIS ACTIVE THAT US AS A BODY WHETHER. A IS REGULATORY OR US LEGISLATIVE WE WILL LOOK AT WHETHER OR NOT THIS OUT TO GO TO STANDARD IS THE APPROPRIATE STANDARD A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS OR AND TO HAND TRADE TRACKS ACTIONS. WE MAY NOT FIND THAT THAT IS THE STANDARD THAT WE WILL AS A STATE WANT TO ABIDE BY BUT I JUST WANT TO PUT THAT OUT THERE THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE WILL WE'LL HAVE TO AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. KEEP AN EYE ON SO TENER. THE SWITCHMAN CHAIR IN AT FASTER THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE TODAY RG STATE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT SINCE -- THE COURT'S DECISION IS WHICH STATE. AS FAR AS POPULATION WEISS. IMPLEMENT -- IS MOVING ON THE USE TAX IN BEING ABLE TO COLLECT WHICH WHICH IS THE LARGEST STATE QUIBBLING TO CALIFORNIA IF YOU WILL -- HAD MOVED WITH IMPLEMENTING. SO FAR AS ADOPTING AWAY FOR STANDARD -- NO TAKE IT WE'RE JUST SAYING TEXAS IS CLOSE. YES YOU MAY MAYBE. MAYBE TEXAS OTHER STATES ARE STILL WAITING TO SAY ANYTHING SPECIFIC -- AND ALSO PROBABLY LIKE US FIGURING OUT IS IT ADMINISTRATIVE OR LEGISLATIVE APPROACH THERE BUT DELIVERY OF THEM IN OUR LARGE STATES THAT ARE SIGNING ON TO WHAT LOOKS LIKE. YOU KNOW A LOW STANDARD BECAUSE IT IN IN OUR STATE BEING SOLD LARGE SO FAR AS NUMBER OF CONSUMERS. THAT WOULD MEAN WILL HAVE A FAR MORE REMOTE VENDORS THAN MOST STATES WOULD HAVE BECAUSE IT WOULD BE EASY TO SAY VALIUM JUST LOOKING FOR EXAMPLE YOU WANT LIKE A CROWD FUNDING WEBSITE. AND PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO RAISE MONEY AND ALL WILL GIVE YOU -- YOU GIVE US TEN DOLLARS OR TWENTY DOLLARS AND WILL SELL YOU A CALENDAR WHEN WE RAISE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY WE STILL SMALL BUSINESSES BUT COULD EASILY HAVE TWO HUNDRED OR MORE TRANSACTIONS IN CALIFORNIA MAYBE NOT -- IN SOUTH DAKOTA SO I THINK WE ALSO THE LOOK AT WHAT'S THE APPROPRIATE BALANCE AND FORCED SAY LESS STILL KEEP ON TRYING TO COLLECT THE USE TAX. VERSUS TRIED EIGHT MANAGED IS VERY LARGE NUMBER OF REMOTE A REMOTE VENDORS. BUT AT THE DOUBLE CHECK WHAT SEEMS TO BE THE LARGEST STATE THAT. WENT WITH THE WAY FAIR STANDARD SO FAR HAS SCREEN I'LL CHECKS AS WELL AND IF HE KNOWS IS AN WALK US THROUGH. DURING TIMES OF A DOWNTURN. IN HOW THAT WORKS IN REGARDS TO COLLECTION. UNDERSTAND YOU HAVE THE HUNDRED THOUSAND FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS TO DAKOTA. HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS A YEAR. SO AT A HUNDRED THOUSAND THRESHOLD WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THEY DIP BELOW TO THE WAY TO THE NEXT TAX YEAR HOW HOW DOES THAT WORK -- IN WALKING THROUGH THAT. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND NOT ALL STATES ARE SPECIFIC ON THAT AS TO WHEN IF EVER NEXUS ENDS -- SOME STATES WILL SAY WELL ONCE SAID AND YOU STILL HAVE TO COLLECT FOR ANOTHER YEAR THINKING THAT SOME OF THAT. NEXUS ACTIVITY STILL LINGERS ON FOR THE NEXT YEAR -- WE CULTURALLY NEXUS BUT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE. I THINK LAID OUT SPECIFICALLY SO THAT VENDORS AREN'T ON CERTAIN THEY KNOW WHAT WHAT THEY NEED TO BE DOING SOME I JUST CONTINUE TO COLLECT THINKING A SALES WOULD GO UP AND THEY GOT THE SYSTEM IN PLACE BUT IN SOME STATES IT MIGHT BE CLEAR. YOU DROP BELOW WHAT YOU CAN STOP COLLECTING OTHER STATES -- MIGHT NOT SAY ANYTHING AT ALL THIS IS A TOWN SURPRISE HAD MANY STATES OF NOT ONLY ADDRESS SPECIFICALLY THE TRAILING NEXUS QUESTION. WHEN DOES IT END YEAH IT IN THAT'S WHERE I THINK AND THAT'S WHERE I FIRST WENT TO IS THAT -- ESPECIALLY FROM HAVING A BAD YEAR RIGHT -- AND WHAT THAT WOULD MEAN FOR ME LONG TERM. OKAY. CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH LESSONS IN THE ROAD ANY GIVEN EXAMPLE -- I THINK IT WAS PROBABLY GOOD FOR US THAT CALIFORNIA WAS THAT THIRD STATE TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. ALL CANNABIS RELATED TAXES WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED -- IN COLORADO WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN WASHINGTON IN TRY NOT TO REPEAT. IF YOU WERE TO SAY MISTAKES THAT WERE MADE BY SOME STATES WHAT WOULD YOU REPEAT AND WHAT ADVICE WOULD YOU GIVE US AS WE MOVE DOWN THIS ROAD. WELL I WOULD SUGGEST BEING SPECIFIC AS TO WHAT A NEW NEXUS STANDARD IS. AND BE THINKING OF IT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF AVOIDING FUTURE LITIGATION. MEAN. PERSONALLY I VIEW THIS TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS AS JUST TO LOW I MEAN IF THAT WAS THE CASE. I THINK THE IF THAT WAS BEEN WHAT IT WAS BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT. I THINK THEY WOULD HAVE SAID NO THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE THE RIGHT STANDARD. UNLESS THE WHAT ANY DOLLAR THRESHOLD IS AGAIN WEIGHING. HOW MANY REMOTE VENDORS WOULD THAT BE TO HAVE? TO ENFORCE THE OF BE UNDER YOUR ENFORCEMENT WEIGHING VERSUS MADE WISHES ALL STAR COLLECTING USED TAX AND YOU STILL HAVE TO CLICK USE TAX MINNESOTA BE OBVIOUSLY VENDORS THAT FALL BELOW THAT THRESHOLD. BUT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE REMOTE VENDORS THAT UNDER LIKE SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD. HUNDRED THOUSAND THAT SOMEBODY'S VENDORS ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES RATIONS AND THAT WOULD BE I THINK A GOOD NUMBER OF REMOTE VENDORS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THINK BEING AS SPECIFIC AS POSSIBLE. MAKING IT EASY FOR ANY VENDOR TO KNOW DO I HAVE SALES TAX COLLECTION OBLIGATIONS IN THE STATE BUT IN THE OF LONGER ARTICLE THAT. I WROTE THAT'S OUT THERE SUGGEST ONE NOT EVEN CREATE SOME HAVE AN ONLINE TOOL YOU'RE ASKED YOU KNOW TEN QUESTIONS OR SOMETHING AND WHEN WHATEVER ANSWER YOU GET. AND YOU PUT THE YOUR ANSWERS AND YELL AND GOOD FAITH. THAT'S YOUR STANDARD ARE YOU SUB THE SALES TAX COLLECTION OR NOT -- MAKE SURE THAT THE CD TFA HAS THE RESOURCES TO GIVE THE PROGRAM FROM NATION TO THESE NEW NEW VENDORS MAKE IT CLEAR AS POSSIBLE WHEN AT THE COLLECT. AND YEAH I THINK WE WOULD NEED TO BE OFFERING A SOFTWARE TO THE REMOTE THIS REMOTE SELLERS. TO MAKE IT SO MORE TO THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX AND THAT THE THEORETICALLY SHOULD HELP IN THE COMPLIANCE. BECAUSE HAS TO BE APPROVED BY THE STATE THAT THIS IS THE SOFTWARE ARE REALLY WORKS AND THE COST IS GOING TO BE LOWER THAN WHAT THE ADDED COLLECTION. OF WOULD BE I THINK MAKING IT AS CLEAR AS POSSIBLE AS REALISTIC WHATEVER WE THINK CAN REDUCE FUTURE LITIGATION BY BEING TOO LOW A STANDARD -- I THINK WOULD BE THE WELL SIR FOR THE FOR THE STATE AND THEN NOT FORGETTING ABOUT PLACE WITH THEM AS TO HOW DOES THIS AFFECT. THEIR DISTRICT TAXES THERE IS CHAIR OF THE SALES TAX THEIR POOLING ARRANGEMENT AS TO HOW YOU THE MONEY GOES IN THE COUNTY POOL GETS ALLOCATED BACK OUT IT'S A COMPLICATED -- PROCESS BUT HOW DOES THIS CHANGE THEIR STANDARD AND WHAT WILL MAKE IT EASY FOR THEM TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE GETTING THEIR ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN A COST EFFECTIVE MANNER. YEAH THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE TABLE AND I THINK THE OTHER PIECES THAT WE ALREADY HAVE BASED OFF OF PROPOSITION -- ENCUMBERED SOURCES OF REVENUE SO AS THAT THOSE FUNDS COME IN. THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE A TO GO INTO EACH OF THOSE INDIVIDUAL POT SO I CAN ONLY IMAGINE CALIFORNIA'S GIVE ME THAT MORE COMPLICATED IN SOME OF THE STATE'S. IS WELL MY LAST QUESTION IS AN ISSUE OF ENFORCEMENT. SO WHAT HAVE YOU HEARD -- IN OTHER STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED STANDARD ABOUT ENFORCEMENT HAS BEEN TRICKY -- AND TO WALK US THROUGH THAT AT THE IT IF YOU DON'T MIND I THINK IT'S PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO TELL BECAUSE SOME OF THE STATES THAT HAVE ADOPTED THE SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD DID MAKE IT EFFECTIVE STARTING OCTOBER FIRST -- I THINK THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW DO THEY REACH OUT TO EVEN IDENTIFY WHO THESE NEW REMOTE SELLERS ARE THAT MEET THAT THRESHOLD THAT DON'T HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE. BECAUSE AS A VARIETY OF WAYS NEED TO MEET THEM IN SOME STATES A BIT MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE SOME STATES TAX -- INTANGIBLE ITEMS WHERE SO IT'S NOT LIKE -- I CAN CHECK THE UPS TRUCKS COMING AND YOU KNOW INTO THE STATE SO THEY'VE GOT A VARIETY OF COUNSELING THAT STILL REMAINS TO BE SEEN. PLUS I WOULD SAY. TELLING VENDORS ALL THE SUDDEN OCTOBER FIRST YOU'RE GONNA BE REGISTERED AND START COLLECTING HERE I THINK THAT'S TOO SHORT OF A TIME FRAME TO BE. BE EFFECTIVE. I AGREE WITH YOU AND I THINK THE ONE IN THE YOU SAID AND IS GOING TO MAKE ONE LAST COMMENT IS -- IN REGARDS TO WHAT SOME THE RAMIFICATIONS WOULD BE I KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME CONCERN SAID -- WE'LL SEE FOLK SHYING AWAY FROM YOU COMMERCE I JUST CANNOT IMAGINE THAT I THINK THEY HAVE IT THERE -- AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO SEE -- WHICH IS A CONCERN I JUST SPECIALLY BEING FROM A SMALLER COMMUNITY -- AND I DO THINK IT CREATES A BIT OF AN EQUAL PLAYING FIELD -- WITH BRICK AND MORTAR AND MAMA POPS. IN HAVING TO STEP UP TIME AND TIME AGAIN. YES NO NO NO I AGREE -- I THINK SOME VENDORS MIGHT DECIDE IF THEY SHOULD THEY HAVE THE LOW DOLLAR TRANSACTIONS THEY'RE GONNA BE MONITORING THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW IF YOU HAVE. SALES OF JUST OVER TWO DOLLARS A STATE NOT TO START COLLECTING SALES TAX ON YOU YET THAT THAT THAT MIGHT BE ENOUGH ON THAT ONE BUT YET THEY'RE OVER THAT ARE THOUSAND THAT MIGHT BE THERE GOOD SIZE BUSINESS AND COULD COULD HANDLE THAT. ARE THE REMAINS REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND I THINK USUALLY THE OF THE VENDORS THE BRICK AND MORTAR -- OPPORTUNITY DENT THEN REMIND FOLKS THAT YES YOU KNOW THE SALES TAX IS MUCH BROADER AND HOPEFULLY THEY'LL BE HEARING OF IT MORE OFTEN. AND THE PEOPLE REMEMBERING TO SHOP IN YOUR LOCAL JURISDICTION THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR MARK -- THANK PROFESSOR ALAN -- NOW THAT YOU'RE WRITTEN THE ARTICLES YOU'RE THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERT SO. APPRECIATE -- YOUR YOUR WORK -- THIS STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX AGREEMENT I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS ASKED BY THE CHAIR -- BASED ON OUR DIALOGUE IT HAS A BOARD. IT HAS ONE VOTE PER STATE OR MEMBERS POTENTIALLY -- IT HAS SEVEN SOFTWARE VENDORS THAT RECOMMENDS -- YOU CAN REGISTER ONE STOP SHOP AND AND THEY PROMOTE ON THEIR WEBSITE THAT THEY ARE A SIMPLIFICATION. MEASURE I TRY. TO GET MY ARMS AROUND THIS IT WAS FORMED IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND SO IT'S BEEN AROUND EIGHTEEN YEARS YOU'RE READY -- IT HAS TWENTY FOUR STATES IS MEMBERS BUT IT ONLY REPRESENTS POPULATION. AND SO THE QUESTIONS I HAD -- I'M NOT SO CONCERNED ABOUT THE ONE VOTE PER STATE I MEAN I WAS PART OF A FIFTY EIGHT MEMBER COUNTY ORGANIZATION AND YOU KNOW AS LONG AS WE GAVE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AT LEAST ONE SEAT ON THE BOARD OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT. YOU KNOW WE KIND OF TOOK CARE OF THE SMALL VERSUS LARGE -- SIDE MAYBE THAT COULD BE ADJUSTED BUT I'M I'M WONDERING WHETHER OR NOT IF WE JOINED AS A STATE. THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO MAKE MAJOR MODIFICATIONS TO CONFORM. IN THEN THAT WOULD BE THE SECOND QUESTION IS WHY EIGHTEEN YEARS AND WE HAVEN'T. WELL YEARS AGO I THINK WE WERE -- THERE WAS LEGISLATION THAT WE WERE OBSERVING THAT THE THE MATTER AND THAT THIS IS MANY YEARS AGO WHICH YOU WOULD HAVE TO MAKE CHANGES TO YOUR REVENUE TAXATION CO TO CONFORM TO WHAT THE MODEL AGREEMENT IS AND I HAVEN'T DONE A SURVEY AS TO HOW MANY CHANGES THOSE ARE. MAYBE THE CD TFA HAS A BETTER IDEA AS TO THE NUMBER OF THOSE OR STAFF HERE HAVE CHECKED HOW MANY CHANGES ARE GOING. SO MODIFYING WOULD BE ONE OPTION ANOTHER WOULD BE MAYBE TO START OUR OWN ORGANIZATION. FOR LARGER STATES WHERE WE COULD BE A LITTLE MORE INDEPENDENT LIKE A TWO TIER. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER YEAH I I'VE I'VE RAISES ARGUMENT FOR YEARS THAT YOU KNOW ALL THE SMALL STATES CAN GATHER TOGETHER BECAUSE IT WILL IT WORK WILL WAS SAYING THIS WHEN COURT WAS SAYING AND QUILL. ALL LOOK OUT THERE'S OVER SIX THOUSAND TAXING JURISDICTIONS ALL WITH DIFFERENT RULES WHILE WE'RE BIG TAXING JURISDICTION WHY CAN'T WE BE ONE SET OF THE RULES IN NEW YORK WE ONE SET OF RULES EVERYBODY ELSE JOIN TOGETHER SO -- I THOUGHT MAYBE THAT WOULD BE AT CHALLENGE AT SOME POINT THAT. YOU KNOW WE HAVE SO MANY. VENDORS THAT WOULD BE DONE WITH CALIFORNIA GET DOWN TO FEWER NUMBER SYSTEMS BUT NEVER OFFICE HE CAME. TO CAN ANY KIND OF LITIGATION BUT YEAH THAT WE WERE THINK EXPLORING BECAUSE MAYBE WE SAY WE WE'VE ADOPTED MAYBE SOME SIMILARITIES. AND SOME WITH SOME WE DO HAVE OF SO FAR AS YOU KNOW THE TAX BEING COLLECTED AT THE STATE LEVEL THAN GOING BACK DOWN TO THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO COLLECT. YOU KNOW. FILE SEPARATE RETURNS FOR THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO WE DO HAVE SOME OF THINGS IN PLACE BUT I THINK THAT BIG WORTH LOOKING AT BECAUSE OUR MONEY PEOPLE WERE A BIG STATE. SO THEN WHAT WOULD THE BENEFIT OF OF BEING INVOLVED WITH THE THE STREAMLINED SALES AND TAX. USE TAX AGREEMENT GROUP WOULD BE THAT THEY WORRY IDENTIFIED. ALL THIS ALL THE VENDORS YOU'RE USING THE TERM VENDORS. AND SO THAT WOULD SAVE MAYBE. THIS STATE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. AND IN TRYING TO FIND WHO THEY NEED TO WRITE LETTERS. TO AYE YEAH THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD POINT OF THEIR A REMOTE VENDOR IN SOME OTHER STATE THEY'RE PROBABLY REMOTE VENDOR HERE AS WELL SO OR THAT WOULD HELP IDENTIFY ALL OF THEM -- USING LIKE YOU KNOW THEY'RE ONE STOP SHOP WOULD WOULD MAKE SEEM TO MAKE SENSE OF SOME FEATURES THAT DO. SEEM TO MAKE SENSE BY GEXA WOULD COME DOWN TO COMPARING THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX SIDE BY SIDE WITH. OR REVENUE TAXATION AGREEMENT WHERE DO WE NEED TO MAKE CHANGES AND HOW. HOW EASY OR SIMPLE WITH THOSE BE I MEAN IT WHEN I AGREE MOST PUT TOGETHER YEARS AGO WHEN THEY WERE DISPUTES OVER DO YOU AROUND UP FOR YOU DO AROUND DOWN TO SOME STATES ROUNDED UP AND SOME AROUND THE DOWN IT WAS A BIG DISPUTE? BEFORE THEY COULD FOUND THE END OF WHILE THEY RESOLVED AT THIS POINT BUT YES BUT THERE WAS THIS CUT THOSE KIND -- TO THOSE OF THE RESULT BUT WOULD THEY BE AND CAUGHT HOW MUCH CONFLICT WITH A. B. IN OUR STATE COMPARED TO STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX AGREEMENT. SO GRAB SOMEBODY ORHE HAS THAT. SIDE BY SIDE COMPARISON WITH THAT WOULD BE THE LAST QUESTION THAT IS THE HISTORY. WHAT OVER THE LAST EIGHTEEN YEARS WE HAVE WE DONE YOU MENTIONED IT WAS A BILL? FOUR YEARS AGO BUT NO NOT MET SO FOR YOUR SAKE AUTOS GOT SOMETHING IN THEIR FILES THAT. WOULD SHOW THAT A LONG TIME AGO THAT WE WERE SUPPOSED TO DO A STUDY OF FOR THAT WE WOULD SIGN ON HE'S OVER TEN YEARS AGO I THINK. SO I DON'T REMEMBER OFF HAND YOUR THANK YOU FOR YOUR THE PROBLEM WITH THAT WITH THAT ON THE YEAH. BUT YOU'RE ASKING YOUR QUESTION DOES RESEARCHING. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION -- AS A MEMBER YOU. THINK YOU ARE YOU AT ONE POINT IN YOUR TESTIMONY YOU MENTIONED THAT PERHAPS NON MEMBER STATES COULD JOIN. ON THE STREAMLINED SALES AGREEMENT -- I JUST WANTED. TO ASK MORE ABOUT THAT LIKE. WHAT DO YOU ENVISION OR HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA ONLY HEARD WAS A IT WAS A WEEK OR TWO AFTER EATING AND ON THEIR AGENDA WAS? WHAT ABOUT NON STATES USING LIKE THE SOFTWARE PROVIDERS YOU KNOW SOMEHOW YOU'RE USING -- THAT SYSTEM WHICH YOU KNOW I THINK ABOUT IT THE REMOTE VENDORS WOULD LIKE THAT BECAUSE IF THEY CAN HAVE ONE SOFTWARE PROVIDER HELPING WITH ALL THE STATES THAT WOULD BE THEIR WAY TO GO AS WELL BECAUSE ACTION MIGHT SEE. THAT HAD TO BE A STATE OF THE OF THE VENDORS THAT THAT THE REMOTE VENDORS MIGHT BE THE ONE SAYING I WANT TO USE THE SOFTWARE NOT JUST AND HE'S TWENTY FOUR STATES BUT I WANT TO USE IT. FOR OTHER STATES. AND THE THAN THE SOFTWARE VENDORS HAS HOWEVER BEEN WOULD COME BACK TO CITY CALIFORNIA SAY WILL FORK UP GIVE US SOME MONEY TO HELP MAKE THAT THAT HAPPEN. BECAUSE I THINK YOU KNOW HUNDRED THOUSAND IS NOT THAT BIG OF A BUSINESS. IN SOME REAL FOR SOME ONLINE RETAILERS. AND FOR THEM TO HAVE. TO USE THE AT THE SOFTWARE FOR THE STREAMLINED AND THEN SOMETHING ELSE FOR THE BIGGER STATES. MIGHT BE A BURDEN FOR THEM. RIGHT SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CALIFORNIA CAN GO IN. ON USING THAT SAME SOFTWARE. YET I THINK BE WORTH LOOKING AT MANY SIR YOUR COMMERCIAL. VENDORS ABOUT JUST WONDERING IF THEY'VE ACTUALLY BY CHANCE APPROACH THE CD TFA TO SEE IF THEY WANT. TO BY THE THE SOFTWARE. BECAUSE OF THE THE VENDORS OF THIS OFFER PROVIDER HAVE AN INTEREST IN DOING THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE PEOPLE USING IT. WOULD. LIKE TO HAVE IT DONE IN EVERY STATE THAT EVEN EASIER FOR THOSE ALL THOSE VENDORS. HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION WHAT HAVE OTHER STATES DONE. TO DO OUTREACH TO THESE ONLINE RETAILERS REMOTE SELLERS. TO INFORM THEM. THAT THERE ARE LIABLE FOR THIS TAX. A THAT THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I'VE I'VE BEEN. TRACKING WHAT WHAT THE STATES HAVE BEEN DOING THE BEST BEST I CAN'T OTHERS OF THE CONSTANT. CHANGE AT THAT TIME THAT TIME THE STATE MIGHT SAY ONE THING TION OF THAT [inaudible] THE YEAH THE PUSH TO GET UP YOU WONDER WHO IS READING THAT MEANS SOME VENDOR DECIDING I'VE EVER COLLECTED IN MARYLAND BUT I'LL START LOOKING AT THE MARYLAND THE DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE WEBSITE BUT THE FIRST. ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE DEPARTMENT OF OF MARYLAND REVENUE MARYLAND WAS OUT GO READ THE CASE AND FIGURED OUT. LIKE I NOT SHOWN THE VENDORS WERE GOING TO DO THAT IF SINCE CLARIFIED THAT WILL MORE DETAIL THAT'S GONNA BE A BIG A BIG DEAL TO HAVE SHE PUSH. THAT OUT AND IT WOULD BE. I GUESS EASIER. FOR YES HAS A THAT IT DIDN'T NOT ONLY EASIER FOR THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX ONES BECAUSE REMOTE VENDORS -- THERE TO ONLY VOLUNTARILY GO INTO THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX. IF YOU'RE REMOTE VENDOR AND YOU SIGN ON I'M GONNA GO REGISTER AND ALL THOSE STATES YET NOW YOU'RE SAYING I'M GONNA REGINALD THE STATE'S EVEN THOUGH I DON'T HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE THERE -- BUT NOT EVEN ON ALL REMOTE VENDORS HAVE SIGNED ON TO THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX STATE SO YEAH THEY'VE GOT DO BIG EFFORT TO PUSH OUT. SO IT'S GONNA FALL PRIMARILY ON YOU THERE. ARE TAX ADVISORS TO SAY HEY WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT THIS YOU'VE GOT SOME EXPOSURE BECAUSE YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLES YOU KNOW NORTH DAKOTA HAS CHANGED -- LAW TO SAY YOU GOT MORE THAN TWO OR TRANSACTIONS YOU TO START COLLECTING -- SALES TAX THERE. THE PUBLIC ATTACK TAX DEPARTMENT YEAH THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M ENVISIONED YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE COULD BE SMALL AND HAVE OVER TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS IN THE STATE AND NOT REALIZE THAT. THEY SHOULD BE COLLECTING THESE TAX RIGHT. OKAY THINKING. ANYONE ELSE I HAVE ONE LAST QUESTION AND I'M NOT SURE IF IT'S FOR YOUR THE LA -- BUT AS WE KIND OF LOOK AT WHAT WE'RE GOING TO DO IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M WONDERING DO WE HAVE ANY IDEA HOW MANY. BUSINESSES WILL FALL WOULD FALL UNDER THE HUNDRED THOUSAND TRANSACTIONS AND HOW MANY IF WE LIFTED IT TO FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOW MANY WE WOULD TAKE OUT AND WHAT THE REDUCTION IN -- KIND OF REVENUE TO THE STATE WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE RIGHT BECAUSE WE WOULD TAKE OUT AREN'T A LOT OF OUR ENFORCEMENT RESPONSIBILITY FOR A LOT OF THE SMALLER COMPANIES AND AND OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IF. I FEEL LIKE IT BE EASIER TO FIND THEM IN THE FIRST PLACE IT WOULD REDUCE OUR FOR ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS I'M JUST CURIOUS IF ANYONE IF WE HAVE THOSE KIND OF NUMBERS AVAILABLE TO US. YOU KNOW THE THE OVER IT WAS OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND I WOULD GUESS WOULD HAVE THOSE NUMBERS BECAUSE THEY'D BE. LIKELY PAYING INCOME TAX AND THE STATE -- BUT OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND ONE IS LIKE BE PAYING INCOME TAX THE STATE SO WE COULD TRACK OF THAT WAY BUT I KNOW THIS OTHER TOOLS AVAILABLE FOR IDENTIFYING THOSE THOSE VENDORS. CAM WISE IT'S I THINK JUST UP TO YOUR BIG. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENTS THAT THESE VENDORS NEED TO BE TRYING TO TRACK THIS. TRACK THIS DOWN AT THE OF FILING OBLIGATIONS HERE AND I THINK ALL THE WILL FALL ON THEIR TAX ADVISORS. ALL RIGHT GREAT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH INTEREST MONEY TODAY. NEXT WE HAVE NICOLAS MADURO'S. GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN CAROLINA. THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TODAY THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. HI MY NAME'S NICK MOTORISTS AND THE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION ALSO KNOWN AS THE C. D. T. F. A WHICH FOR EASE OF SPEAKING I WILL. CALL IT THAT TODAY -- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY THANK YOU TO TO THE COMMITTEE STAFF WHO'S JUST A PLEASURE TO WORK WITH AND IT'S BEEN INCREDIBLY HELPFUL ON THIS AND MANY OTHER SUBJECTS -- I REALLY APPRECIATE THEIR COOPERATION PARTNERSHIP. I'M HAVE SOME REMARKS AND THEN OF COURSE I WELCOME ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE TODAY -- I ALSO HAVE SOME MEMBERS OF THE FANTASTIC CD TFA TEAM HERE WITH ME TODAY IN CASE YOU HAVE ANY. QUESTIONS THAT REACH BEYOND MY DEPTH. IN THE VERY COMPLEX IT'S A VERY COMPLEX ISSUE OF USE TAX. SO -- JUST BY WAY OF BACKGROUND CD TFA ADMINISTERS MORE THAN -- THIRTY SEVEN STATE TAX AND FEE PROGRAMS INCLUDING THE STATE SALES AND USE TAX TOBACCO FUEL CANNABIS TAXES AND MANY OTHERS. LAST FISCAL YEAR WE COLLECTED ALMOST SIXTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN REVENUE -- NOW. THE VAST BULK OF THAT IS THE SALES AND USE TAX AND JUST -- TO CLARIFY ABOUT 55% OF THE SALES AND USE TAX TO BE COLLECTS COLLECT GOES OUT TO ON THE LOCALS -- TO CITIES COUNTIES TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES OTHERS ABOUT 45% OF THAT -- COMES TO YOU FOR GENERAL FUND REVENUE -- HERE IN THE STATE. THE DEPARTMENT WAS JUST CREATED IN JULY OF LAST YEAR I JOINED A COUPLE OF WEEKS LATER BEEN A BUSY. BUSY YEAR. WE'VE IMPLEMENTED THE CANNABIS TAXES YOU KNOW SENATOR -- WE'VE -- CONDUCTED ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED EDUCATION EVENTS AROUND THE STATE WE'VE BEEN STREAMLINING OUR PROCESS SEES -- TO BETTER HELP SMALL TAXPAYERS. WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON A LOT OF AUDITS THAT IT IS AND CORRECTIVE ACTION PLANS. MOVE ALSO IMPLEMENTED A BIG NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM THAT'S BEEN A REAL CHALLENGE. BUT THROUGH ALL OF THAT ONE OF OUR BIG -- EFFORTS OF FOLK OF FOCAL POINT OF OUR EFFORT HAS BEEN THE COMMERCE -- FROM THE EARLIEST DAYS DEPARTMENT WE'VE RECOGNIZED THAT WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE WITH -- ONLINE SALES APPROACHING 10% OF ALL RETAIL SALES -- THIS IS A HUGE. AREA OF IMPORTANCE FOR US AND FOR THE STATE NOT ONLY IS IT A BIG SOURCE OF OUR TAX GAP BUT IT IS ALSO GROSSLY UNFAIR. TO BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS AND TO MAIN STREET BUSINESSES AROUND THE STATE -- THAT ARE AUTOMATICALLY UNDER CUT -- BY AT LEAST SEVEN AND A QUARTER PERCENT ON SALES DAY IN AND DAY OUT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. OUR REVENUE ESTIMATE IS THAT -- THE STATE IS LOSING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND TWO BILLION DOLLARS -- ANNUALLY THAT'S THE COMBINED STATE PORTION AND AND LOCAL PORTION -- DUE TO THE E. COMMERCE TAX GAP -- IS TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF UPDATE ON WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WHAT WERE PREPARING TO DO TO ADDRESS THAT -- SO I'D LIKE TO START WITH GIVING A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF SALES AND USE TAX WHICH ALREADY HEARD SOME BUT I'LL GIVE YOU. A JUST A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TAKE. TO ALL TALK ABOUT OUR EXISTING EFFORTS AND WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING -- WITH REGARD TO HE COMMERCE FOR THOSE MERCHANTS THE TO HAVE PHYSICAL NEXUS IN THE STATE. THREE ALL PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION THE WAY FAIR DECISIONS INTERPLAY WITH THE STATE'S LONG ARM STATUTE AS WE SEE IT AT THE DEPARTMENT -- THEN ALL -- LIKE TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF TIMELINE AN UPDATE ON WHAT ARE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS UNLESS OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. SO FIRST -- TO THE SALES AND USE. TAX BACKGROUND WHICH ALREADY HEARD SOME OF TODAY. AS YOU KNOW WE'VE GOT A SEVEN IN QUARTER PERCENT STATEWIDE RATE -- WITH CERTAIN PERCENTAGES ALLOCATED TO THE STATE TO CITIES THE COUNTY'S TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES AND OTHERS -- ON TOP OF THAT RATE WE HAVE -- DISTRICT TAXES IMPOSED BY JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE STATE. OF THESE ARE -- FOR EXAMPLE SACRAMENTO SACRAMENTO COUNTY HAS A POINT 5%. DISTRICT TAX THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO ALSO HAS A POINT 5% DISTRICT TAX. SO IF YOU WERE TO PURCHASE TAXABLE TANGIBLE PERSONAL PROPERTY WITHIN THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO. WE PAY THE SEVEN AND A QUARTER PLUS THAT EXTRA 1% SEE PAY EIGHT AND A QUARTER PERCENT -- FOR SALES TAX TO APPLY. THE LAW REQUIRES BOTH IN STATE PARTICIPATION OR NEGOTIATION BY THE RETAILER AND THE TITLE PASSES IN THE STATE. IF THOSE TWO CRITERIA ARE NOT MET THEN THEN WE'RE APPLYING USE TAX NOT USED TAXES THE PLIGHT AT THE SAME RATE AS THE SALES TAX. THE ONLY REAL DIFFERENCE THAT I THINK IS -- RELEVANT HERE TODAY IS IS. WITH REGARD THE ALLOCATION OF THAT. 1% -- BRADLEY BURNS TAX. WHICH IN A USE TAX SCENARIO -- GOES INTO A COUNTY WIDE POOL WHICH IS THEN ALLOCATED -- ACCORDING -- TO THE SALES TAX -- ALLOCATION RATES WITHIN THAT. WITHIN THAT COUNTY -- TODAY I'M TALKING ABOUT USE TAX BECAUSE POST WAY FAIR. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ONLINE RETAILERS WITHOUT ANY PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE SO BY DEFINITION. THESE ARE RETAILERS WITHOUT IN STATE PARTICIPATION IN SALE. IN THERE'S ONE FOR THE POINT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT TODAY. ALL OF THE TAX IN IT AND THIS IS I THINK CAN'T BE STRESSED ENOUGH ALL THE TAX WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IS ALREADY DO. THE ONLY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT CONSUMERS IN CALIFORNIA. ARE REQUIRED TO DECLARE AND KEEP TRACK OF AND REMIT THAT TAX THE STATE THEMSELVES. OR AS HAPPENS IN WITH ALL OTHER TRANSACTIONS THAT YOU USED TO WHETHER THE RETAILER. WILL -- HAS THAT OBLIGATION TO KEEP TRACK OF COLLECT AND REMIT THE TAX -- SO THAT'S WHY I CAN'T EMPHASIZE THAT ENOUGH THINK IT'S RULING PARTY KEEP THAT MIND MISTER DIRECTOR I IT. SHE DIED. UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IN REGARDS -- I'D IT'S ALREADY DO. THOSE TWO ITEMS YOU JUST MENTIONED ARE REALLY BIG. RIGHT DO THEY EVEN KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE ABLE TO REMAIN AT IN RIGHT NOW NOT TECHNICALLY THE THE RETAILER THE CONSUMER KNOW THEIR THE RETAILERS TO IT THESE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE -- IN IN IMPLEMENTED I IS MORE OF A CHALLENGE THAN JUST SAYING THAT IT'S THEIR DO IT IS ALTHOUGH I DO THINK IN AND WE'LL GET TO THIS AND I I APPRECIATE THE COMMENT. I DO THINK. IN A IN SOME OF THE CONVERSATION THAT I'VE HEARD IN IN SITTING IN THE AUDIENCE FOR THIS. WE ARE. OVER PLAYING I THINK TO SOME EXTENT. THE SMALL BUSINESS ANGLE HERE AND I CAME HERE FROM THE SMALL BUSINESS ADMINISTRATION I'M. VERY FOCUSED ON THE IMPACT OF ALL THIS ON SMALL BUSINESS. BUT IT. OUR RESEARCH TELLS US THEIR PROXIMALLY 80% OF ONLINE SALES. COME FROM 2% OF RETAILERS. WE HAVE SOME VERY LARGE RETAILERS. WHO ARE AMONG THE MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COMPANIES ON EARTH? WHO ARE NOT -- COLLECTING AND REMITTING USE TAX SO. IF WE CAN BRING THOSE VERY TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED COMPANIES INTO COMPLIANCE WE WILL GO A VERY LONG WAY TO CLOSING THE TAX CAP. NOW CERTAINLY THERE ARE SMALLER RETAILERS ALSO -- WHO MAY BE IMPACTED BY THIS BUT? I I THINK IF WE FOCUS SOLELY ON SMALL RETAILERS WHO MIGHT HAVE TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS WE MAY BE MISSING THE FOREST FOR THE TREES -- ANYWAY IF I COULD BRING IN -- TALK A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE'VE ALREADY BEEN DOING SO EVEN PRIOR TO WAY FAIR. RETAILERS WHO HAVE -- PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE. WERE REQUIRED -- TO COLLECT AND REMIT USE TAXES IT. HAS BEEN APPARENT THAT MANY RETAILERS. WITH PHYSICAL PRESENCE -- HAVE NOT BEEN LIVING UP TO THAT OBLIGATION. MANY OF THESE RETAILERS HAVE PHYSICAL PRESENCE THROUGH WAREHOUSING OF GOODS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO AT CD TFA WE'VE OVER THE PAST YEAR [inaudible] EXCUSE ME. WE HAVE -- GONE ABOUT -- DOING OUR OWN RESEARCH TO TRY TO IDENTIFY THOSE RETAILERS. WE CONTACTED MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OF THEM -- IN THE PAST YEAR. WE'VE OF PERMITTED -- SOME HUNDREDS OF THEM AND I THINK IN THAT EFFORT. WE'VE COLLECTED ABOUT SIXTY NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN. ADDITIONAL REVENUE DEVOTED TO THOSE EFFORTS TO THAT'S THESE ARE THE RETAILERS THAT DO YOU HAVE ANY -- PHYSICAL PRESENCE WITHIN THE STATE -- WE WILL CONTINUE REGARDLESS OF WHAT WE DO -- WITH WAY FAIR OUT OF STATE RETAILERS WITHOUT A PHYSICAL PRESENCE WE WILL CONTINUE THAT EFFORT -- I EXPECT THAT WE WILL BE CONTACTING MANY MORE RETAILERS -- IF WE DO HAVE A PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THE STATE. AND REQUIRE THEM TO GET PERMITTED AND COMPLY -- RETAILERS I ANYBODY LISTENING I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU. TO COME FORWARD BEFORE WE CONTACT YOU BECAUSE THERE ARE BENEFITS. TWO COMING FORWARD AND VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSING IF WE FIND YOU BEFORE YOU FIND US -- YOUR OPTIONS ARE MORE LIMITED SO -- SO I DON'T INTERRUPT YOU BUT MAYBE THEY USUALLY HAVE THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION I ASKED BEFORE WHICH IS. WHAT WITH THE DIFFERENT WHAT IS THE DO YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF HOW MANY COMPANIES THAT? ARE HOW MANY BUSINESSES BECAUSE LIKE YOU SAID YOU'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT REALLY 2% OF THE COMPANIES WOULD FALL UNDER OR ABOVE UNDER THAT ABOVE THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR UNDER THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND OUR THRESHOLD. I DON'T. I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE THAT I HAVE AN ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF COMPANIES OF A DIFFERENCE IN REVENUE I DO WE DO HAVE AN ESTIMATE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND A HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND AND I THINK THE DIFFERENCE IN REVENUES OF ABOUT YOU KNOW THAT TO GO TO A LARGER INCOME IT BECAUSE THE VAST BULK OF THE SALES WERE TALKING ABOUT ARE REALLY FROM SOME GIANT. COMPANIES. OKAY -- SO AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM PROFESSOR ALAN AND ELLIE OF WAYFAIR CAME ALONG -- IN LATE JUNE OF THIS YEAR -- WITH SPRING COURT DECISION. AND EVEN BEFORE THE DECISION CAME OUT WE WERE LOOKING AT POSSIBLE. HOW WOULD INTERACT WITH -- THE STATE'S LONG ARM PROVISION. HELLO. IN A REVENUE TAXATION CODE SECTION SIXTY TWO OH THREE SUBDIVISION SEE. WHICH EXPRESSLY PROVIDES THAT THE TERM RETAILING CATION BUSINESS IN THE STATE MEANS ANY RETAILER THAT HAS SUBSTANTIAL NEXUS WITH THE STATE. FOR PURPOSES OF THE COMMERCE CLAUSE U. S. CONSTITUTION -- AND ANY RETAILER PAWN HIM FEDERAL LAW PERMITS THE STATE TO IMPOSE THE USE TAX COLLECTION DUTIES SO BASICALLY. OUR JURISDICTION EXTENDS AS FAR AS CONGRESS AND THE CONSTITUTION PERMITS -- AND AS YOU'VE ALSO HEARD THOUGH THE CORDON WAY FAIR DIDN'T PROVIDE DEFINITIVE GUIDANCE AS TO WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS AND SO. WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME DOING A LOT OF LEGAL RESEARCH -- AND IT IS YOU KNOW HAS BEEN VERY COMPLICATED I THINK THAT'S WHY I'VE SEEN. NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA TEXAS FLORIDA NEW YORK AND SOME OTHER BIG STATES -- HOLD BACK -- IN ANY EVENT -- WE ALSO DO THEY'LL REALIZE THAT WE ARE AND NEED TO MOVE FORWARD THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS -- PAST THIS LONG ARM STATUTES FOR EXACTLY THIS EVENTUALITY -- BUT THERE ARE SOME QUESTIONS NEED TO ANSWER AND AMONG THEM ARE WHAT ARE THE APPROPRIATE THRESHOLDS AS YOU'VE HEARD -- WHAT ARE THE IMPACTS ON IT IN STATE SELLERS WHICH IS -- ONE OF THE QUIRKY THINGS OF OUR CODE THAT HASN'T COME UP IN TODAY'S HEARING BUT WHATEVER WE DO WILL IMPACT -- IN STATE SELLERS AS WELL. OF WHAT'S THE MOST EFFICIENT OUT OF STATE COLLECTION PROCESS -- WHEN WILL THE OBLIGATION BEGAN -- HOW LONG WILL BUSINESSES HAVE TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE -- HOW WILL LOCAL DISTRICT TAXES BE IMPACTED -- THE COSTS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND THE RISK OF LITIGATION ARE JUST SOME OF THE QUESTIONS. THAT WE ARE. CONTEMPLATING GIVING THE GIVEN THESE AND OTHER QUESTIONS AND BEFORE WE FINALIZE ANY IMPLEMENTATION. WE ARE EAGER TO HEAR FROM ALL STAY SAYS. BUSINESSES INCLUDING THOSE WITH PHYSICAL PRESENCE IN THOSE WITHOUT -- RETAILERS LARGE AND SMALL CITIES COUNTIES. OTHERS NON PROFITS -- WE ARE SCHEDULING OR HAVE SCHEDULED. A STAKEHOLDER MEETING FOR NEXT WEDNESDAY AT TEN AM AT THE DEPARTMENTWE WELCOME PARTICIPATION BY ANYONE INTERESTED -- WELL WE DON'T AND WHAT WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FULL CONTOUR IS OF IMPLEMENTATION LOOK LIKE ONE THING I DO WANT TO STRESS TO ANYBODY LISTENING -- WE CERTAINLY WILL NOT BE IMPOSING ANY RETROACTIVE LIABILITY WE'RE ONLY LOOKING AT PERSPECTIVE -- SOLUTIONS TO THIS SO. THAT IS SOMETHING THAT COMES UP. OFTEN SO I WANNA MAKE SURE PEOPLE UNDERSTAND THAT -- WE DO EXPECT THAT WE WILL -- ISSUE A NOTICE SOMETIME -- BEFORE THE END OF THE YEAR. TO BUSINESSES INFORMING THEM OF THERE NEED TO COMPLY WITH. A SIXTY TWO OH THREE WITH WITH CALIFORNIA'S TAX LAWS. AND WE EXPECTED SOMETIME IN THE FIRST. HALF BURKE FIRST PART OF TWENTY NINETEEN THAT -- THAT. THAT NOTICE WOULD A REQUIRE COMPLIANCE -- A FEW OTHER THINGS THAT I THINK IT'S WORTH MENTIONING -- AS WE LOOK AT REVENUE AND AND WHOSE IMPACTED -- AS I MENTIONED YOU COMMERCE SALES VERY CONCENTRATED -- SECOND -- IN THERE WITH THIS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. YOU'RE LOOKING AT A VERY DIFFERENT SLICE THE MARKET BETWEEN BUSINESS TO BUSINESS -- TRANSACTIONS AND BUSINESS TO CONSUMERTRANSACTIONS I THINK WE OFTEN THINK OF THE BUSINESS TO CONSUMER TRANSACTIONS BECAUSE MOST OF US HERE ARE. THAT'S HOW WE INTERFACE WITH ONLINE RETAIL. BUT ACTUALLY THE BULK OF ONLINE RETAILERS BUSINESS TO BUSINESS -- A HUGE PERCENTAGE THAT THOUGH IS OUR SALES FOR RESALE SO THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO TAX. A AND ALSO I THINK COMPLIANCE APPEARS TO BE HIGHER IN THE B. TO B. SEGMENT -- PERHAPS BECAUSE WE ALSO -- IN FORCE USED TAX LAWS WHEN WE DO OUR BUSINESSES IN THE STATE -- SO WE'RE CHECKING USE TAX LIABILITY -- FOR THOSE TAXPAYERS THAT ARE ALREADY PERMITTED BY CD TFA -- IN THE BUSINESS TO CONSUMER WHAT'S A SMALLER SEGMENT OF THE MARKET THE COMPLIANCE RATES. ARE. MUCH WORSE [inaudible] SO -- AND LASTLY IN THIS CAME UP -- BEFORE AS WELL. THE IT COMPLYING -- ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE OF THE STATE WILL BE MORE COMPLICATED WE'RE WE RECOGNIZE THAT -- CDFA DOES HAVE FOUR OFFICES. DEVOTED EXCLUSIVELY TO OUT OF STATE RETAILERS. WE HAVE ONE IN SACRAMENTO WHICH IS CALLED NOW TO STATE OFFICE WHICH IS CONFUSING. THAT DEALS WITH THE WESTERN UNITED STATES BUT THEN WE HAVE OFFICES IN HOUSTON CHICAGO. NEW YORK AS WELL THAT FOCUS SOLELY ON ENFORCEMENT. OF FOR OUT OF STATE RETAILERS SO. THIS IS SOMETHING WE'RE USED TO WE HAVE A MILLION TAXPAYERS ALREADY. IN OUR SYSTEM. I THINK WE CAN HANDLE WHATEVER ADDITIONAL WORK IT IS BUT BUT IT IS MORE COMPLICATED AND CAN BE MORE TIME CONSUMING. I WITHOUT A SERVICE HOURS SO WITH THAT THOSE ARE FEW THE ISSUES I HOPE THIS IS HELPFUL AND I LOOK FOR TO ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY [inaudible] SENATE MCGUIRE. I THINK SO MUCH. VENTURA STRUCTURE THANK YOU AS ALWAYS -- FOR THE COMPREHENSIVE IN A IN. WITH A GOOD PRESENTATION JUST A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU EVER WORKS THANK YOU SO WORKLOAD IS A CRAZY BUSY FOR YOU IN THE DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW -- AND JUST TECHNOLOGY UPGRADE AND THEN YOU'RE STILL DEALING WITH THE THE GOOD TIMES WITH CANNABIS IN TRYING TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT. YES IT IS NOT BEEN THE SMOOTHEST IT'S A SUCH A CHALLENGE -- TO BE TO BRING FOLKS IN COMPLIANCE. SO THEN YOU ADD THIS TO ANOTHER LAYER UNDERSTANDING THAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT -- RETAILERS. AN SAME TIME THEY'LL. ANYTIME ANYTIME ARE WE DO TECHNOLOGY HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT COULD BE CHALLENGE THAT I WAS GIVEN ASSURANCES IT IS COULD BE REALLY SMOOTH ROLLING OUT. WE ALL KNOW IT'S ALWAYS THE MORE COMPLICATED YEAH SO. YEAH THERE YOU GO SO WALK US THROUGH THAT BECAUSE IT IS JUST ON THE WAY LIFE SO WHAT'S. YOUR THOUGHT. ON BEING ABLE TO BRING COMPLAINTS IN IN. HOW DO YOU BRING THAT REMAIN TO THE 20% INTO THE FULL WELL. TO VIEW MY CERTAIN SURE HAPPENS SO IF. THE REGISTRATION PIECES RELATIVELY EASY -- YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE AN ONLINE REGISTRATION IT'S NOT INCREDIBLY COMPLICATED I'VE. GONE THROUGH IT MYSELF NOT AS A BUSINESS OWNER BUT AS A HAS A TWO MEMBER THEIR CD TFA USE WANTS TO TEST OUT THE NEW COMPUTER SYSTEM NOT THAT PARTS. NOT DIFFICULT -- THE AUDIT PROCESS TYPICALLY. A AGAIN UNLESS WE SEE REAL IRREGULARITIES OR REAL RED FLAGS RAISED. THE AUDIT PROCESS TYPICALLY DOESN'T BEGIN TO LET'S SAY THREE YEARS INTO A REGISTRATION CYCLE -- FOR ANYBODY LISTENING I DON'T WANT TO THANK YOU CAN -- NOT COMPLY FOR THREE YEARS THAT'S NOT HOW IT WORKS -- SINCE WE DO GO BACK EIGHT YEARS OFTEN AND OUR AUDITS -- SO I THINK. YOU KNOW WHAT THE BEGINNING PART WOULD BE A MATTER OF GETTING REGISTRATION AND GETTING PEOPLE INTO THE SYSTEM -- WE DO A LOT OF OUR REGION EDUCATION I THINK THAT'S SORT OF HOW WE WOULD -- FOCUS. OUR EFFORTS SIDE TO TRY. TO BRING VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE WHICH IS REALLY THE CHEAPEST MONEY WE CAN BRING INTO THE SYSTEM BECAUSE COLLECTIONS EFFORTS ARE MORE EXPENSIVE AUDIT IS EVEN MORE EXPENSIVE SO. OUR FOCUS IS REALLY ON HELPING PEOPLE WHO WANT TO COMPLY -- VOLUNTARILY [inaudible] I THINK. FOR THE LARGE FOLKS -- I DON'T THINK THAT WILL BE VERY DIFFICULT I THINK IN THE PAST YOU'VE SEEN SOME PEOPLE PROTEST THAT. THERE IS IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT HOW COULD WE POSSIBLY DO IT AND THEN SOMEHOW WITH THE FLIP OF A SWITCH -- THEY ARE THEN ABLE TO COLLECT AND REMIT VERY ACCURATELY -- FOR SOME MID TO SMALLER SIZE RETAILERS AGAIN. WHATEVER NUMBER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE ARE JUST THE SALES IN CALIFORNIA SO. PRESUMABLY Và YOU HAVE HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN SALES IN CALIFORNIA YOUR MAY BE A YOU KNOW. FIVE MILLION DOLLAR -- IN SALES RETAILERS SO AGAIN. IN OF THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD SIZE YEAH I WISH MY MOM AND POP HAD A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR A YEAR. BUSINESS I WOULD. MAYBE I'D STILL BE SITTING HERE BUT MAYBE I'D BE ON THE BEACH SOMEWHERE AND ANYWAY THAT'S NEITHER HERE NOR THERE -- BUT SO I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW I I KEEP THAT IN MIND THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE ARE THESE AND IT'S IT CAME UP BEFORE WITH REGARD TO STREAMLINED. THESE ARE NOT STREAMLINED I I DON'T BELIEVE THESE ARE STREAMLINED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS THERE ARE A HOST OF COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS. THAT BUSINESSES CAN. I SUBSCRIBE. TO TO HELP THEM -- THAT WILL TELL THEM EXACTLY WHAT THEIR TAX OBLIGATIONS ARE -- DEPENDING ON WHERE THE SALE IS SOPHISTICATED -- AND THEIR NUMBER OF THOSE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE SO I THINK PEOPLE WOULD DO THAT JUST AS IN STATE BUSINESSES -- RELY ON PAID SOFTWARE AND OTHER THINGS IN ORDER TO COMPLY TO WITH THE TRANSITION SO MOVING -- ON IN AND AGAIN THIS IS NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE SUBJECT I REALLY DO THINK THAT YOU DO A FANTASTIC JOB AND I'M REALLY HAPPY -- THERE SANCTI INSINCERE -- BUT THE THE TRANSITION WITH MORE EQUALIZATION RIGHT -- THAT'S THIRD ANSWERING CALLS ON THAT ONE IS YES THERE HAVE BEEN I BRING ALL THIS UP IS THAT JUST IF YOU CAN GIVE US. BALLPARK ON THE TIME HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU NEED IN REGARDS -- TO BRING IN YOUR OFFICE. INTO COMPLIANCE WITH -- ENFORCEMENT NUMBER -- TWO I IT WOULD EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE NEEDING SOME TYPE OF BUDGET AUGMENTATION. I'M TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN WHAT IS THIS LOOK LIKE AS FAR AS YOUR STRUCTURE WHAT WHAT WHAT SITES HAVE YOU HAD -- AS IF YOU DON'T MIND THIS WALK US THROUGH THAT WELL -- I THINK IN TERMS OF TIMING I'M. I'M LESS FOCUSED ON OUR TIMING BECAUSE I THINK WE ARE READY. TO WE'RE READY TO GO IN TERMS THE REGISTRATION PIECE I'M. I'M VERY INTERESTED IN HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND HOW MUCH TIME THEY NEED TO COMPLY -- IT N. IN TERMS OF RESOURCES -- YOU KNOW I THINK. YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEM. AGAIN WE HAVE A MILLION TAXPAYERS SO EVEN IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOME NUMBER OF THOUSANDS. OF EXTRA TAXPAYERS COMING INTO THE SYSTEM AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT A MILLION WE IT'S IT'S A PRETTY SMALL INCREMENTAL IN YOUR BALLPARK. WHAT AS FAR AS FOLKS WHO WOULD BE COMING INTO THE SYSTEM IN ADDITION TO WHAT YOU HAVE NOW JUST BALLPARK? ARE WE TALKING TEN THOUSAND WE TALKING FIFTY THOUSAND I A WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY BUT I THINK. GIVEN HISTORIC COMPLIANCE RATES AND WHAT WE SEE WITH SOME OTHER NEW TAXES. WE'RE NOT GOING TO GET A RUSH OF EVERY -- SMALL RETAIL YOU KNOW EVERY SMALL RETAILER I WOULD SAY IT'S IN THE PROBABLY. I DON'T I I'D HATE A THOUSAND EIGHT TO ESTIMATE BUT I DON'T THINK WE'RE TALKING MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND I THINK WE'RE TALKING FEWER THAN THAT -- IN TERMS OF RESOURCES ON WHAT WE WILL. OF COURSE WE COULD USE EXTRA RESOURCES WHAT WE DO AND WHAT WE DO CURRENTLY IS WE PRIORITIZE OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES I HOPE I'M NOT. GIVING AWAY SECRETS WE PRIORITIZE OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES BASED ON THE POTENTIAL -- FISCAL IMPACT FOR THE STATE. AND SO WE WOULD -- MOVE OUR YOU KNOW WE WOULD LOWER OUR AUDIT THRESHOLD FOR SOME OTHER. A BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES -- IF WE THOUGHT WE COULD GET MORE MONEY PRIORITIZING SOME OF THESE LARGER -- OUT OF STATE RETAILERS WEEK WE COULD OF COURSE SO. SO WE WOULDN'T BE DOING. THESE ON TOP OF EVERYTHING ELSE WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING WE WOULD. SWITCH OUT SOME OF WHAT WE CURRENTLY DO -- FOR SOME OF THESE HIGHER VALUE IN FORCE ACTIVITIES UNLESS OF COURSE WE DID RECEIVE ADDITIONAL. A RESOURCES BUT YOU KNOW THE THE KEY IN TAX ADMINISTRATION IS DETERRENCE I MEAN WE'RE NOT OUT THERE. PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE'S A GOOD CHANCE OF THEM. BEING -- FOUND OUT IF THEY IF THEY TAXES AND AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE ENOUGH. BODIES OUT THERE -- POUNDING THE PAVEMENT AND DOING AUDITS AND COLLECTION ACTIVITIES TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE KNOW THAT. IN VENTURE MY LAST QUESTION DISAPPOINTED I PROMISE IS -- LESSONS LEARNED FROM OTHER STATES CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH THAT [inaudible] WELL -- OTHER STATES ARE JUST GETTING GOING -- MOST STATES THAT HAVE PRECEDED HAD LEGISLATION -- A LOT OF STATES OF ACTED. IN THE PAST YEAR TWO YOU KNOW SOME POST WAY FARE -- SOME PRE [inaudible] I IT. THE THE A LOT WENT LIVE OCTOBER FIRST IS PROFESSOR NALAN MENTIONED [inaudible] BUT I HAVEN'T HEARD AYE AMONG OFTEN TALK WITH THE OTHER TAX ADMINISTRATORS IVAN HEARD A TON OF REGRETS FROM THOSE THEY'VE GONE FORWARD DOOR -- WHO WERE CONCERNS ABOUT? HOW THEY'LL DO PEOPLE ARE PLOWING FORWARD AND? IT SEEMS TO BE. GOING OKAY THUS FAR [inaudible] SURE. I DO HAVE A QUICK QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON SO I WANNA MAKE SURE I UNDERSTOOD. YOU'RE DOING A NOTICE PROCESS SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NOSE PROCESS AND THE REGULATORY PROCESS IN WHICH STAKEHOLDERS WILL HAVE THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO WELL [inaudible] SO. OUR LEGAL ANALYSIS IS THAT THE STATUTE THE LONG ARM STATUTE IS. ALREADY APPLIES THAT IS THE LAW. OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND SO -- V.. I I THINK WE'LL WE MAY FOLLOW I THINK WE'LL WE ARE PLAN IS TO FOLLOW UP WITH WITH REGULATIONS BOTH TO HELP US INTERNALLY. A AND TO UP POTENTIALLY FILL IN SOME GAPS BUT I THINK THAT THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW THE LAW IS OUT THERE AND IT'S ON THE BOOKS AND I THINK WE'LL. WE BELIEVE THAT WE COULD PROCEED WITH NOTICE -- TO REQUIRE PEOPLE TO COMPLY. SO THAT WHEN THEY COMPLY THEY WILL BE COMPLYING WITH THE SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD OR WHAT WHAT ARE THEY COMPLYING WELL THAT'S NOT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THAT. WE'LL BE DISCUSSING AT OUR STAKEHOLDER MEETING THERE ARE AFTER THE NOTICE NO THAT WOULD BE IN THE NOTICE WE WOULD TELL PEOPLE IT WHICH WHICH SALES LEVEL THEY NEED TO COMPLY OF COURSE. THAT WOULD BE A RETROSPECTIVE YOU KNOW YOU THE FOR FOR PROSPECTIVE COMPLIANCE BUT YOU LOOK AT AT THINGS I NEED YOU TO WALK ME THROUGH IT. SO THERE'S A NOTE SO YOU'RE GONNA GIVEN NOTICE AND IT IS GOING TO SAY. TO IS GOING TO SAY THAT WE ARE MAINTAINING THE SOUTH DAKOTA STANDARD AND WE WILL HAVE A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS EVENTUALLY SO. THAT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S COMING FROM THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IS COMING FIRST WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE MEETING NEXT WEDNESDAY. I THINK THE NOTICE WILL SAY. YOU KNOW IF YOUR SALES IN CALIFORNIA IN THE PRECEDING -- YOU KNOW IN THE PRECEDING TWELVE MONTH PERIOD ARE ABOVE ACTS IN IT -- WE IS IF IT'S ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS OR SOMETHING DIFFERENT DEPENDING ON WHAT -- THE BEST LEGAL ADVICE WE CAN. CAN MUSTER THEN WE EXPECT YOU TO COMPLY WITH CALIFORNIA USED TAX OBLIGATIONS [inaudible] PROSPECTIVELY [inaudible] GOT IT [inaudible] WITH. JUST HAD A NO NAME THINKING MANAGER OF ARENA SO WHAT ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO COMPLY WITH AND WHAT IS THE STANDARD WHICH AT THE THRESHOLD CAN HIT SO WHAT WHAT WHAT THREAT THAT'S WHAT I'M. YOU KNOW I I I'M GOING INTO NEXT WEDNESDAY WITH A COMPLETELY OPEN MIND SO I DON'T WANT TO PRE JUDGE. I THINK -- AS PROFESSOR ALAN MENTIONED IT'S RELATIVELY COMPLICATED BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE ALL OF THOSE -- SAME IT DOES HAVE EXACT SAME STRUCTURE AS SOUTH DAKOTA. I THINK -- OUR LEGAL TEAMS I THINK IT'S FAIR TO SAY OUR LEGAL TEAMS -- GOING INTO THE STAKEHOLDER MEETING BELIEVES THAT -- THAT WE WOULD BE ON SOLID GROUND WITH A ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS BUT WHETHER THAT ALTERNATELY IS THE STANDARD. IS SOMETHING THAT WE HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED AND WE ARE OPEN TO CONSIDERING. AND THAT'S THAT THE PEACE IN ANY DON'T EVERYONE PUT WORDS INTO THE CHAIRMAN'S AMOUNT SO -- SO WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE IS LEGISLATION IT'S ADVANCE IT CREATES A DIFFERENT STANDARD AND THAT WOULD OF COURSE OUR OUR INTENT IS ONLY -- TWO IMPLEMENT THE LAW THAT YOU ALL OF PASSED THE LEGISLATURE DID PASS THIS LONG ARM STATUTE AND NOW WE ARE DOING OUR LEVEL BEST TO IMPLEMENT. THAT LAW SO THAT THAT WOULD BE JUST WALKING THROUGH THIS AND AND THANK YOU FOR PLAYING TWENTY QUESTIONS WITH US. AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE HEY SO YOU WOULD GO WITH WHATEVER STATE WITH THAT THE STANDARD IS IT'S ON THE BOOKS NOW. LET'S JUST SAY THE LEGISLATURE WOULD CHANGE THAT STANDARD. AND THAT WOULD BE SIGNED INTO LAW EVEN WITH AN URGENCY SOMETIME LATER IN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN YOU WOULD COLLECT A PART OF THE YEAR. AT LET'S JUST SAY THE HUNDRED THOUSAND STANDARD. AND IF THE LEGISLATURE SAID WE WANTED TO GET A COLLECTED A TWO OR THOUSANDS ARE STANDARD THAT WOULD THEN BE PRO RATED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE YEAR I'M JUST TRYING. TO DETERMINE IF YOU'RE GONNA BE SENDING OUT A LETTER. HEAVY DUTY. AFTER YOUR STAKEHOLDER MEAN YOU'RE GONNA DETERMINE THRESHOLD. AND THEN THAT SPECIAL CHANGES BY THE LEGISLATURE -- JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THIS WORKS AND HOW WE CAN BE CLEAR WITH THE MARKET PLACE AND I JUST WANNA ADD TO THAT QUESTION CENTURY ANSWERING MOST OF IT. AND I JUST HAVE A LITTLE OUT ON IS IS THE URGENCY TO PUT THE NOTICE OUT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE WOULD BE COLLECTING WHAT IS THE URGENCY BEFORE. TO BUT THE NOTICE OUT ARE OR THE I THINK ON OUR URGENCY IS SIMPLY THE THAT THERE IS A STATUTE ON THE BOOKS IN CALIFORNIA. AND MY JOB. AS I SEE IT IS TO EMPLOYMENT. THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND BUT THAT'S THAT'S THE EXTENT OF OF MY URGENCY. IN ALL SAY IN THIS IS MORE OF AN EDITORIAL THAN A QUESTION WOULD BE IS THAT. ABSOLUTELY YOU'RE RIGHT ANY TO BE A TO CARRY THROUGH DISCREET AN AWKWARD DYNAMIC -- I THINK THERE'S TWO ROUTES THAT'S COULD BE IMPLEMENTED THIS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED IN A BUDGET BILL -- IT THROUGH THE MINISTRATION OR THIS COULD BE IMPLEMENTED THROUGH LEGISLATION UNDERSTAND AS WE HEARD FROM PROFESSOR MANY STATES ARE CHOOSING LEGISLATIVE ROUTE. SO IF YOU CHOOSE TO BE TO GO WITH THE STANDARD HERE BY THE END OF THE YEAR INTEL RETAILERS ARE THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO COMPLY TO X. STANDARD. IN THE LEGISLATURE DECIDES BE ABLE TO ADVANCE LEGISLATION AND A DIFFERENT STANDARD IT CREATES. SOME LOGISTICAL CHALLENGES IN SINGLE CONFUSION SO I'LL ALL I WOULD SAY IS I THINK NUMBER ONE I THINK WE NEED TO BE TO DETERMINE. AND CAN NEVER TELL THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT TO DO SO I TOTALLY GET IT WHAT THE ROUTE IS GONNA BE TAKEN -- AND WHAT THAT STANDARD IS TO NO ONE SO THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF CONFUSION OUT -- IN THE MARKET PLACE THAT'S THOSE CONCERNS ARE CERTAINLY ON OUR MINDS AS WELL WHICH IS ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. YOU KNOW NOT TO WE DID NOT WANT TO BE PRESUMPTUOUS BUT WE IN FACT. LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATIVE LOOKING AT THE CORE DECISION -- OUR TEAM -- PUT DOWN SOME THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE THOUGHT LEGISLATION MIGHT. IN FACT LOOK LIKE AND YOU KNOW IN IN. WHY I THINK OUR OUR THOUGHTS WERE IF WE WERE LEGISLATING A NEW SYSTEM? THAT WE WOULD. HAVE A HIGHER THRESHOLD SATISFIED HAVE AND THEN NOT HAVE A A NUMBER OF TRANSACTIONS THAT WE WOULD HAVE. I THINK A MARKET PLACE PROVISION WHICH I THINK WOULD. WOULD MAKE TAX ADMINISTRATION MUCH EASIER -- IN FACT THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK YOU KNOW WE PURPOSEFULLY. WAITED A BIT ODD TO SEE WHETHER THAT MIGHT. OCCUR. LET ME HELP YOU SO WE SPOKE AT THE END OF LAST YEAR AND THERE WAS A DESIRE I THINK AMONG SOME TO TRY DID HANDLE THIS AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE HOWEVER. THERE WERE THE OVER ARCHING DESIRE WAS NOT THERE TO GET IT DONE THROUGH A BUDGET TRAILER BILL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- HOWEVER THAT IS WHY I ASK THE QUESTION IS THE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE PUSH IS NOW IF IT'S FROM CD TFA IF IT IS FROM THE MINISTRY WHERE THE PUSH IS NOW TO GET A NOTICE OUT SO QUICKLY. AS WE'VE WAITED IT'S NOT LIKE THIS DECISION JUST CAME IN I MEAN THE DECISION WAS. HAS BEEN MADE FOR I BELIEVE IT IS. HEY I HAS TO TO RAISE BECAUSE IT WAS NOT ONE OF OUR FINEST HOURS BUT IN FACT YOU KNOW -- RIGHT AFTER THE DECISION RIGHT IS ISSUED WITH THEIR WAS A A CHEST PAGE PUT UP ON OUR WEBSITE WHICH WOULD HAVE HAD. A NOTICE THAT HAD A VERY SPAN ARE -- PERIOD -- SO THIS IS BEEN FROM THE GET GO I'M WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ENFORCE THE LAW SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S THIS IS BEEN SINCE JUNE SO THEY HAVE THEIR OWN LANGUAGE CAME OUT IN JUNE -- ON THE WEBSITE. AND THEN WAS PULLED BACK OFF THE WEBSITE AND SO WE HAVE SO THIS CONVERSATION HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR A BIT HOWEVER THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE REST BECAUSE THEY DO. SHARE YOUR CONCERNS AND WE SHARE THEM WITH NICHOLAS IS THAT -- IF WHAT'S SOMETHING GOES INTO PLACE AND THEN WE DON'T FEEL IT'S THE APPROPRIATE THRESHOLD WHICH I THINK. I THINK A HUNDRED THOUSAND IS VERY LOW I THINK ASSEMBLY WOMAN RIVA SAID THAT AS WELL FOR A STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WITH THE AMOUNT OF CONSUMERS WE HAVE AND I THINK WITHOUT SMALL MARGIN THAT YOU. LOSE IN REVENUE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND I THINK THAT WE SEE A LOT OF THE BENEFITS ON YOUR SIDE AND ON OURS. BUT THAT'S I REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND I I AM CLASS. WELL WITH TAX LAW WE HAVE EVERY YEAR. I I WISH THAT THE LEGISLATURE WERE THIS RETICENT TO CHANGE TAX LAW NORMALLY BECAUSE WE HAVE EVERY YEAR MANY MANY BILLS THAT. THAT. FIND THEIR WAY TO A TO US WERE -- WE CHANGE TAX ALL I I PERSONALLY NOT INCREDIBLY TROUBLED THOUGH I I UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE PROSPECT OF IF IF THE LEGISLATURE WERE TO CHANGE THE THE THRESHOLDS. AT SOME POINT WE WOULD. CHANGE THE THRESHOLDS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER VOEPEL YOU HAVE. YES AND I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR FOR MEETING WITH ME EARLIER AND WE WENT OVER -- SO MY CONCERNS -- I JUST WANT TO REITERATE FOR THE GROUP HERE THAT -- SO FAR OUR COLLECTIVE TAXES ON MARIJUANA HAS NOT BEEN STERLING -- IT'S MUCH EASIER TO GO TO YOUR LOCAL CORNER DEALER AND GET IT OF THE STATE PRICE. THEN IT IS TO GO TO THE DIFFERENT DISPENSARIES THAT ARE DOING IT LEGALLY AND THAT LEGAL GROWERS THAT HAVE TO PAY ALL THE ACTOR FEES AND TAXES AND PERMITS. SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS. HERE. IS THE DARK WEB. IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE OF A MASSIVE ECONOMIC ENGINE. ON THE DARK WEB THEY'RE NOT JUST GET YOUR SOUL SECURITY NUMBER ON IT THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF COMMERCE -- NOT THAT I WOULDN'T KNOW WHAT'S THIS I HEAR IT. I HAVE FRIENDS THAT HE WOULD PACKARD. SO WHAT. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS IS AS WE COME OUT OF THE GATE. UP IT'S LIKE YOU WERE A FISHERMAN WITH A NET. OKAY YOU'RE GOING TO CATCH THE PEOPLE GET THEIR TAXES WE WANT TO CATCH THE FISH [inaudible] GOT IT. I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE ALL LOOK AT MAKING THE NET. IS BIG AND WIDE AS POSSIBLE WITH THE FIRST CASS. LITTLE LITTLE FISH OUT GO AFTER THE BIG FISH. THEN WE CAN CHANGE THE NET DOWN THE ROAD QUE. IN TILL IT'S FINALLY WE WE WE WE HIT THAT -- BALANCE WHERE IT'S FAIR. TO THE MOST PEOPLE BECAUSE SMALL BUSINESSES. I DON'T GET IT HALF THE TIME. AND THE AVERAGE CONSUMER IF I'M NOT BEING CHARGED A SALES TAX ON TAKEN ON MAYBE YOU KNOW. ONCE NOT DO SO [inaudible] QUITE A OFTEN IT'S AN EDUCATION THING WHICH I HAVE GREAT CONFIDENCE YOUR GOING TO BE DOING THAT. BUT JUST KEEP A WIDE NET THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU CAN I JUST YES WORSE. FIRST I I AGREE IN AND ALL OF OUR ACTIVITIES GENERALLY INVOLVE YOU KNOW WE LIKE. GOOD FISHERMAN WE ARE GOING AFTER THE BIGGER FISH FIRST THAT'S HOW WE EXPAND OUR RESOURCES -- IN IT AS TO THE DARK WEB BEEN AND ALL THAT THERE ARE MANY. RETAILERS WHO HAVE COME INTO COMPLIANCE -- WITH ONLINE SALES. AND CONTINUE TO BE. VERY SUCCESSFUL SO. I DON'T VIEW AGAIN THIS TAXES VIEW THIS AS ANY EFFORT. TO PUT FOLKS OUT OF BUSINESS OR DRIVE PEOPLE AND I DON'T THINK PAYING THE USE TAX IS GOING TO DRIVE PEOPLE IN THE BLACK MARKET I THINK IT'S IT'S SIMPLY. UNFAIR AND IT'S THE LAW. THURMOND ARE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER DIRECTOR AND THANK YOU FOR MEETING WITH ME THIS. MORNING I I STILL HAVE A FEW. QUESTIONS A SHORT -- AFTER OUR OUR ROBUST DISCUSSION EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE IN YOUR OR DEPARTMENT IS IN ITS INFANCY UP. ARE YOU PERMITTED TO ISSUE REGULATIONS YES. SO CAN YOU START. WITH YOUR THRESHOLDS THROUGH REGULATIONS AND THEN WAIT FOR THE LEGISLATION. WE COULD I DON'T KNOW THAT OUT. OUR LEGAL DEPARTMENT HAS ADVISED THAT THAT'S NOT [inaudible] NESSA'S NECESSARY GIVEN THE STATUTE BUT THAT IS WHY. A POSSIBLE AVENUE FOR PRECEDING. IT COULD TAKE. A YEAR. REGULATIONS COULD TAKE UP TO A YEAR -- AS WHAT I UNDERSTAND IN. IT'S NOT A FAST PROCESS MCKAY THEN OF THE SECOND QUESTION IS -- GOOD TO COMMENT ON THE STREAMLINED SALES AND USE TAX AGREEMENT. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT IT AND SEE IF YOUR THUMBS UP OR THUMBS DOWN WELL I THINK THE AS I UNDERSTAND IT I THINK THE LEGISLATURE MAY HAVE DONE A AN ANALYSIS IN. TWO THOUSAND NINE EIGHTEEN OR SO -- THAT FOUND IT WOULD REQUIRE HUNDREDS OF CHANGES TO CALIFORNIA TAX LAW -- IT WOULD DISALLOW THINGS LIKE OF THE PARTIAL EXEMPTIONS THAT -- CALIFORNIA HAS TO PROMOTE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES THAT THE STATE DETERMINES ARE BENEFICIAL -- SO IT'S IT'S BY. PROBLEMATIC FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS WHY I BELIEVE. THERE ARE ASPECTS YOU KNOW IF THERE WERE CENTRALIZE REGISTRATION THAT'S ONE THING I KNOW SOME OF THE STATE'S OF TALKED WITH STREAMLINED ABOUT JUST USING IT AS A PORTAL SO SOMEBODY COULD. REGISTER WITH MORE SIMPLY WITH ALL THE STATE'S NOT SOMETHING THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT ALTHOUGH WE WOULD HAVE. TO GIVEN THAT OUR REGISTRATION PROCESS IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT AND REQUIRES SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT FORMATION WE WOULD. HAVE TO GO BACK TO THOSE SELLERS BUT WE COULD AT LEAST IDENTIFY THEM THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO THAT'S THAT SEEMS TO BE THE MOST FRUITFUL PATH OF THE MOMENT RATHER THAN -- MASSIVELY OVERHAULING OUR OWN TAX LAWS TO CONFORM. WITH -- STREAMLINED. DO YOU HAVE A WHITE PAPER. ON THIS PARTICULAR WE CAN CERTAINLY PUT ONE TOGETHER I DON'T HAVE ONE FOR YOU AT THE MOMENT BUT I WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HAVE OUR OUR TEAM MIND A IT SOUNDS LIKE THAT'S AN AREA OF INTEREST IN A WELCOME THE CHANCE FOR US. TO PUT TOGETHER SOME MORE INFORMATION ON STREAMLINED IN. HOW IT? INTERFERE IN A PLACE WITH CALIFORNIA SALES AND USE TAX LAW AND PROVIDE THAT TO THE COMMITTEE. OR EVEN ON COMMITTEES -- WEBSITE AS A MODULE JUST WHY WERE IN A WHY WE'RE NOT -- IF YOU'RE LOOKING FOR A LITTLE UNIFORMITY THIS IS. THIS IS A A PLACE TO FIND IT WERE WERE ONE SHY OF FALL AFTER THE STATE'S BEING INVOLVED -- I'M JUST WONDERING -- WITH REGARDS TO THE USE TAX -- THERE'S A LINE ON THE FORM FIVE FORTY WERE. IF YOU HAVEN'T PAID WHEN YOU HAVE ONE OF THESE AT ESTATE TRANSACTIONS -- THAT YOU'RE YOU PAY FOR ON YOUR FORM FIVE FORTY AT HOW'S THAT WORKING OUT [inaudible] IT -- I DON'T HAVE THE LATEST NUMBERS BUT IT'S NOT A LARGE SOURCE OF REVENUE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO THEN HOW DO WE DEAL WITH THAT. AND AND WHAT ARE WE DOING FOR SAY THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY WORRY NIBBLED AT IT BUT I JUST YEAH JUST A COUPLE MINUTES JUST. TO WELL THE UNDERGROUND ECONOMY AND WITH REGARD TO USE TAX -- WITH RICK I'M WITH REGARD TO THIS I MEAN HOW WE DEAL WITH THAT IN MY MIND IS. AS WE DO WITH I MEAN IMAGINE IF. FOR BRICK AND MORTAR RETAILERS WE DIDN'T HAVE THE RETAILER COLLECT THE SALES TAX AND WE HAD THE THE REPORTING OBLIGATION ON THE CONSUMER. SIMILARLY ON THE TAX FORMS NOT MANY PEOPLE WOULD SAY I WENT OUT AND YOU KNOW. BOUGHT A NEW TV IT AT X. BIG BOX STORE. AS YOU KNOW THREE MONTHS AGO AND HERE'S MY TAX PEOPLE WOULDN'T PAY IT SO IN MY MIND. WHAT MAKES THE MOST SENSE IS TWO ESPECIALLY NOW THIS IS BRING CORD IS SPOKEN SAID THIS IS WHAT WE CAN DO -- IS TO HAVE -- ONLINE SELLERS REMOTE SELLERS DO THE EXACT SAME THING THAT WE ASK -- BUSINESSES TO DO AND THAT'S ONE OF THE OTHER POINTS HERE YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERN WHICH I GET ABOUT. YOU KNOW SMALLER SELLERS AND HOW COULD THEY POSSIBLY COMPLY EVERY DAY. IN EACH OF YOUR CONSTITUENCIES. THOUSANDS OF BUSINESSES. SMALL MEDIUM AND LARGE ARE FINDING WAYS TO COMPLY. BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE STATE DO THIS DAY IN AND DAY OUT. IT'S SOMETHING WE REQUIRE OF THEM I DON'T KNOW. TO ME THAT IT'S FAIR NOT TO REQUIRE THAT OF% OTHER PEOPLE -- WHO IN MANY CASES ARE WAY LARGER? AND MUCH MORE SOPHISTICATED THAN THE SAME BUSINESSES THAT WE'RE YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY TAX LAWS AGAINST AND AND THEY'RE NOT AGAINST WOULD ENFORCING TAX LAWS WITH -- THROUGHOUT THE STATE. ANYWAY THAT'S GET OFF MY SOAPBOX THERE. THANK YOU MANAGER ASSEMBLY MEMBER REVERSE. SWITCH BUT TO BE CLEAR -- THE THRESHOLD YOU MENTION YOUR NEXT WEEK YOU WILL -- PUBLISHED NEXT WEEK WE'RE JUST HAVING A MEETING TO STATE QUARTERBACK YEAH OKAY BUT ARE YOU OF SUGGESTING A THRESHOLD NEXT WEEK NO WE'RE DISCUSSING IT I'M. AS I MENTIONED ARE LAWYERS -- HAVE LOOKED AT THE ISSUE LEAVE. THAT. THEY WOULD BE COMFORTABLE -- AND IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF COMFORT BECAUSE IF YOU READ THE WAY THE STATUTES WRITTEN. AND THIS IS WHERE THE THE COMPLICATION COMES AND IT DOESN'T SAY -- NEAR THE STICK STATES LONG ARM STATUTES [inaudible] DOESN'T SAY. CDT FAA ARE. THE WE EXISTED THEN DECIDE WHETHER GOOD THRESHOLD IS IT SAYS -- IN FORCES TO THE FULL EXTENT ALLOWED BY THE COMMERCE CLAUSE. AND SO AGAIN I'M NOT TRYING TO SUBSTITUTE -- MY JUDGMENT DEPARTMENTS NOT TRYING TO SUBSTITUTE OUR JUDGMENT WE'RE TRYING TO LOOK AT OKAY WHAT DOES THAT. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN WHETHER WHETHER THE LEGISLATURE TELL US TO DO AND SIXTY TO SIXTY TWO OR? THREE AND ARE LAWYERS -- INITIAL -- REVIEW IS THAT THAT FULL EXAM THE COMMERCE CLAUSE -- THAT THEY'RE COMFORTABLE THAT THAT MEANS ONE AND WE'RE TWO HUNDRED TRANSACTIONS GIVEN WITH SPRING COURT SAID [inaudible] I FULLY EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE. OTHER PEOPLE WHO HAVE. LEGAL ADVICE THAT THAT IS PERHAPS NOT THE RIGHT INTERPRETATION LATIN I WANNA HEAR WHAT EVERYBODY HAS TO SAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE [inaudible] NO. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. SENATOR REQUIRE TO HAVE CLOSING STATEMENTS. I THINK IT'S MUCH BETTER HERE AGAIN I WANNA. SORRY WE HAVE TO PUBLIC ON FIRST I TELL YOU JUMP THE GUN. WE'LL TAKE WE'LL HOPE WE WILL HAVE COMPLETELY COLOGNE AND AND IT ONLY. NOT LAUGHING AT THE PUBLIC COMMENT LAUGHING AT MYSELF. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS ROBERT TERRACE OF THE CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION. CELTIC SUPPORTS IMPLEMENTATION OF SOUTH CURSES WAYFARER BUT WE BELIEVE THAT A THOUGHTFUL APPROACH NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE -- WE ALL HEARD TODAY OF THE NUMEROUS COMPLEXITIES AND NUANCES OF SALES TAX LAWS AND IT'S IMPORTANT -- TO GET THIS RIGHT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. IT IS CRITICAL THAT CALIFORNIA'S DEFINITION OF RETAILER IS LEGALLY VIABLE AND DOES NOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST INTERSTATE COMMERCE. THE US SUPREME COURT GAVE STATES PRINCIPLES -- AND A ROAD MAP TO LOOK AT WHEN IMPLEMENTING THEIR DECISION. AND IT'S IN EVERYONE'S VESTED INTEREST THAT WE STICK WITH THESE PRINCIPLES IN IMPLEMENTATION -- LONG TERM STATUE ESTABLISHES ECONOMIC NEXUS BUT OUR LONGARM STATUE IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN SOUTH DAKOTA'S LAWS WE NEED -- TO TO INCLUDE SOUTH DAKOTA'S -- PRINCIPLES IN THE US A SUPREME COURTS -- PRINCIPLES AS WELL AND MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. HEY MAN CHAIRWOMAN MISTER CHAIR KEITH ON HER BEHALF SO FULL COUNTIES COALITION THE TWENTY FOUR COUNTIES THAT RELY ON SALES TAX TO HELP BUILD AND MAINTAIN OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ALL -- AND IF THROUGHOUT THIS COMING YEAR IN THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS THAT YOU SEE FIT TO IMPLEMENT -- AS BEST AS POSSIBLE THIS PROGRAM GET IT RIGHT I THINK THAT WE FOUND OUT TODAY THAT THERE'S A LOT TO DISCUSS WILL BE HAVING OUR ANNUAL CONFERENCE A COUPLE WEEKS WITH DIRECT MURDEROUS COMING DOWN THE PARTICIPATING -- IT'S SOMETHING WE'VE BEEN FOLLOWING CLOSELY AS THE COUNTIES WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THAT DIALOGUE WITH YOU SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR HAVING THIS HEARING TODAY. MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CHRIS MCKINLEY ON BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND WE SHARE THE PERSPECTIVE THAT CAL TEXTURE THANK YOU. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT CINNAMON GUARDIAN INCLUDING STATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH MANAGER. JUST WANNA AGAIN SEE HOW GRATEFUL I AM TO CHAIR -- INTO THE SIMPLY STAFF FOR ALL THEIR WORK AND OF COURSE EVERYONE ON THE SENATE SIDE INTO THESE AND THEN THERE WAS A SENATORS WHO ATTENDED TODAY'S HEARING. ON HOW MUCH WE APPRECIATE ADVANCING THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION IT'S CLEAR THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE A LOT OF CONVERSATION AS WE ADVANCE AND HOW. AT THIS COURT DECISIONS CAN BE IMPLEMENTED -- HERE IN CALIFORNIA I DO THINK THE DIRECTOR IS IN A BIT OF A ROCK AND A HARD PLACE -- WANTING TO BE ABLE TO HE NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO INTO HIM OUT BY THE LEGISLATURE -- SERVER YEARS BACK I AND HOW WE ARE CREATING A CONFUSING SITUATION IF THE LEGISLATURE ACTS AND DECIDES ON DIFFERENT THRESHOLDS OF WHAT -- THAT YOUR WOMAN AND I WERE JUST TALKING ABOUT IS SAYS SITTING DOWN WITH THE DIRECTOR HERE IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS -- TOGETHER AND JUST. HAVING SOME CONVERSATION -- ON THAT -- AND AND IT WILL GIVE HIM TIME TO BE OVERTAKEN INDUSTRY INPUT WHICH I THINK IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL I'D TO ANY TYPE OF IMPLEMENTATION HERE -- ACROSS THE STATE IN ADDITION I WOULD HOPE. THAT THE DIRECTOR WOULD BE SITTING DOWN WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT AYE AS SITTING DOWN WITH THE INDUSTRY TO BE -- TO GET THEIR INPUT AS WELL -- AS IT IS THAT FIFTY FIVE FORTY FIVE NEXT -- THIS MAY WOULD BE A MEETING TO BE HONEST AGAIN -- FIRST DISCUSSION HERE ORIGINALLY MANY IN THE MONTHS TO COME AND YOU WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE SIMPLY -- CHAIR IS WELL AS STAFF.

FOR DOING THIS TODAY THANK YOU FROM THE MEMBERS AND CENTERS THAT CAME AS WELL AS A SPEAKERS -- I APPRECIATE THE TIME AND ENERGY ON THAT YOU'VE PUT INTO THIS ISSUE SINCE JUNE SENSE ARE AND BEFORE THE DECISION WAS MADE -- I I DON'T WANT TO REPEAT WAS SERRA REQUIRES AND HOWEVER I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING NOW WITH THE DIRECTOR I I WILL SAY THIS I DO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE THAT WHATEVER THE DIRECTOR DOES THAT THE LEGISLATURE. AT HAVE THEIR OWN STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT WE SIT DOWN WITH WHAT LOCAL BUSINESS WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND REALLY UNDERSTAND DIRECTLY WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS. TRULY ARE TO TO THOSE PEOPLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- AND TO JUST PUT ON THE DIRECTOR I DO NOT THINK IT IS. ALTHOUGH ALTHOUGH IN HIS LEGAL SOUNDS NOT NECESSARILY THE COURSE OF ACTION THAT ARE CONSTITUENTS OF ASKED US TO TAKE SO. WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE AGAIN FOR BEING HERE LOOK FORWARD TO SPEAKING WITH THE DIRECTOR SHORTLY AND WOULD STAKEHOLDERS -- THOSE INTEREST IN HAVING A CONVERSATION MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU SO MUCH EVERYONE HAVE A GOOD DAY THE* HEARING IS ADJOURNED
