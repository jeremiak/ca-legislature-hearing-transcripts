USE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY. AND

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:12.290
THEY COME ON LINE. RENEVIA

THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. AND

00:28:34.979 --> 00:28:37.015
IT IS NOT LIKELY TO MEET OUR

00:28:37.082 --> 00:28:40.852

pABOUT THIS. SEASONAL ENERGY

00:29:02.574 --> 00:29:04.476
STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES CAN FILL

00:29:04.542 --> 00:29:06.377
THE GAP BY PROVIDING ENERGY

00:29:06.444 --> 00:29:09.781
ENERGY STORAGE. SO THAT WELL WE

AND MY OFFICIAL TITLE HALF

00:33:14.592 --> 00:33:16.127
CALIFORNIA ISO IS STORAGE

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:20.498
SECTOR MANAGER AND- IF THAT. I

00:33:20.565 --> 00:33:22.367
MEANS WHAT IT SAYS I MANAGE

00:33:22.433 --> 00:33:24.369
MOST THINGS THAT THE ISO RELATE

00:33:24.435 --> 00:33:28.673
TO STORAGE. LIKE NEW POLICIES-

00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:31.609
THAT ARE COMING ONLINE NEXT

00:33:31.676 --> 00:33:33.277
MODELS THE RESOURCES AT OUR

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:35.613
MARKET AND EVENTUALLY GET THEM

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:38.049
COMPENSATED FOR THE ENERGY THAT

00:33:38.116 --> 00:33:39.384
RESTORED RESOURCES THAT THEY

00:33:39.450 --> 00:33:40.818
MOVE AND POORLY FROM ONE PART

00:33:40.885 --> 00:33:42.653
OF THE DAY TO THE OTHER. AND

00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:46.924
FOR- OPTICAL RESEARCH

00:33:46.991 --> 00:33:48.426
DEPARTMENT FOR THE ENERGY TO

00:33:48.493 --> 00:33:55.600
GET- SO WITH THAT IN MIND I'M

00:33:55.666 --> 00:33:57.435
GOING TO BE SPEAKING ON A LOT

00:33:57.502 --> 00:33:59.070
OF THE THINGS THAT ASSEMBLY

00:33:59.137 --> 00:34:01.873
MEMBER BURKE JUST MENTIONED AND

00:34:01.939 --> 00:34:05.109
SETTING THE BACKDROP BACKDROP

00:34:05.176 --> 00:34:05.743
FOR THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'RE

00:34:05.810 --> 00:34:07.145
GOING TO HAVE TO DAY. SO FOR

00:34:07.211 --> 00:34:09.280
REFERENCE AND IT IS NUMBERS

00:34:09.347 --> 00:34:10.748
THAT WE CAN KEEP IN MIND THE

00:34:10.815 --> 00:34:12.884
CALIFORNIA SYSTEM IS A SUMMER

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:15.253
PEAKING SYSTEM. AND IT TAKES

00:34:15.319 --> 00:34:17.221
THAT JUST UNDER FIFTY THOUSAND

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:19.056
MEGAWATTS. DOWN DURING THE

00:34:19.123 --> 00:34:21.426
SUMMER DURING THE MOST CRITICAL

00:34:21.492 --> 00:34:23.161
HOURS OF NEED FOR THE SYSTEM.

00:34:23.227 --> 00:34:25.463
CONDITIONALLY MOST OF THE LOAD

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:26.731
IN THE STATE HAS BEEN SERVED

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.533
WITH NATURAL GAS FIRED

00:34:28.599 --> 00:34:30.868
GENERATION AND OVER THE YEARS

00:34:30.935 --> 00:34:32.403
WE'VE SEEN DEEPER AND DEEPER

00:34:32.470 --> 00:34:34.472
PENETRATION OF RENEWABLE

00:34:34.539 --> 00:34:36.507
RESOURCES. AND YOUR ACCOUNT

00:34:36.574 --> 00:34:37.074
YEAH THAT'S TRUE ACROSS THE

00:34:37.141 --> 00:34:39.143
COUNTRY YOUR CALIFORNIA'S

00:34:39.210 --> 00:34:40.311
RENEWABLE RESOURCES HAVE

00:34:40.378 --> 00:34:42.380
PRIMARILY BEEN SOLAR ALTHOUGH

00:34:42.447 --> 00:34:44.715
WE DO HAVE SOME WIND GENERATION

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:46.651
AND FROM SMALL HYDRO FACILITIES

00:34:46.717 --> 00:34:50.521
ON OUR SYSTEM AS WELL THAT MAKE

00:34:50.588 --> 00:34:52.356
UP SOME OF THAT GENERATION- THE

00:34:52.423 --> 00:34:53.724
STORAGE RESOURCES IN PARTICULAR

00:34:53.791 --> 00:34:58.296
HAVE BEEN GROWING. CONSIDERABLY

00:34:58.362 --> 00:35:01.933
RETURNS- YEARS AND MONTHS- JUST

00:35:01.999 --> 00:35:03.734
FOR REFERENCE LAST YEAR WE HAD

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:07.271
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MAKE A LOT

00:35:07.338 --> 00:35:09.474
OF WORDS ON OUR SYSTEM. TODAY

00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:12.009
WE HAVE ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED

00:35:12.076 --> 00:35:13.778
MEGAWATTS OF STORAGE OR SYSTEM

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.880
SO AGAIN FOR A TOTAL SYSTEM

00:35:15.947 --> 00:35:17.748
THAT SERVING A LITTLE BIT LESS

00:35:17.815 --> 00:35:19.750
THAN FIFTY THOUSAND MEGAWATTS-

00:35:19.817 --> 00:35:21.686
A JUMP OF ONE THOUSAND

00:35:21.752 --> 00:35:23.888
MEGAWATTS OF ANY TECHNOLOGY IS

00:35:23.955 --> 00:35:26.524
A PRETTY RADICAL CHANGE. AND A

00:35:26.591 --> 00:35:28.493
JUMP OF A THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

00:35:28.559 --> 00:35:31.429
NEW GENERATION OF SOMETHING

00:35:31.496 --> 00:35:32.230
THAT WE DON'T REALLY HAVE

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:34.699
ONLINE. PRIOR TO THAT IS A VERY

00:35:34.765 --> 00:35:37.034
BIG CHANGE- THAT APPLY

00:35:37.101 --> 00:35:39.604
ADDITIONAL WORLD. THAT THE

00:35:39.670 --> 00:35:42.773
SYSTEM OPERATOR NEEDS DID YOU

00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:43.975
UNDERSTAND HOW THESE RESOURCES

00:35:44.041 --> 00:35:46.978
WORK- HOW TO USE THESE

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:48.880
RESOURCES THE MOST EFFICIENTLY

00:35:48.946 --> 00:35:51.415
AND EFFECTIVELY AND- HOW

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:52.817
THEY'RE GOING TO INTEGRATE WITH

00:35:52.884 --> 00:35:54.352
THE REST OF THE SYSTEM THAT WE

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:57.021
HAVE ONLINE I JUST WANT I HATE

00:35:57.088 --> 00:35:58.155
TO INTERRUPT GONE GONNA BREAK

00:35:58.222 --> 00:36:00.458
MY OWN RULE. UP THAT'S FIFTEEN

00:36:00.525 --> 00:36:02.460
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF POWER HOW

00:36:02.527 --> 00:36:06.731
MANY HOURS CAN. YOU RUN THAT

00:36:06.797 --> 00:36:07.665
FIFTEEN HUNDRED MEGAWATT.

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:08.199
LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THREE

00:36:08.266 --> 00:36:10.301
HOURS SO NEARLY AND I WAS JUST

00:36:10.368 --> 00:36:11.769
ABOUT TO GET TO THAT- BUT

00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:13.638
NEARLY ALL OF THE RESOURCES

00:36:13.704 --> 00:36:15.239
THAT ARE IN OUR SYSTEM TODAY

00:36:15.306 --> 00:36:17.942
OUR LITHIUM ION BATTERIES. AND

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:20.211
MOST OF THE RESOURCES ON OUR

00:36:20.278 --> 00:36:22.780
SYSTEM OUR FOUR HOUR DURATION

00:36:22.847 --> 00:36:24.448
SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS IF YOU

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.083
HAVE A PLUS OR MINUS TEN

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:27.818
MEGAWATT BATTERY SO IT CAN

00:36:27.885 --> 00:36:30.454
EITHER CHARGE FOR AS MUCH AS I

00:36:30.521 --> 00:36:32.089
CAN MAKE A LOT WORKING JUST

00:36:32.156 --> 00:36:33.391
CHARGE AS MUCH AS TEN O'CLOCK

00:36:33.457 --> 00:36:35.092
ANY INSTANTANEOUS POINT IN

00:36:35.159 --> 00:36:37.094
TIME. THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STATE

00:36:37.161 --> 00:36:38.863
CHARGES THOSE RESOURCES CAN

00:36:38.930 --> 00:36:41.332
ACCOMMODATE IS BETWEEN ZERO

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:43.701
MEGAWATT HOURS AND FORTY

00:36:43.768 --> 00:36:45.136
MEGAWATT HOURS SO THEY CAN.

00:36:45.202 --> 00:36:58.616
TAKE. OUR DURATION SOME OF THEM

00:36:58.683 --> 00:37:01.319
ARE ONLY ONE HOUR DURATION AND

00:37:01.385 --> 00:37:01.919
THAT'S WHAT BRING THE AVERAGE

00:37:01.986 --> 00:37:05.790
DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT. VERY

00:37:05.856 --> 00:37:10.561
GOOD PLEASE PROCEED. ABSOLUTELY

00:37:10.628 --> 00:37:13.864
SO THE NOTED THE CHANGES AND

00:37:13.931 --> 00:37:16.767
THE CAPACITY VALUES- YEAR OVER

00:37:16.834 --> 00:37:19.904
YEAR ARE VERY VERY LARGE- THE

00:37:19.971 --> 00:37:20.638
LAST TIME THAT WE'VE SEEN

00:37:20.705 --> 00:37:22.206
ANYTHING LIKE THIS WITH ABOUT

00:37:22.273 --> 00:37:23.941
TEN YEARS AGO WHEN WE HAD

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:26.010
SIMILAR YOU KNOW I WOULD I

00:37:26.077 --> 00:37:27.979
WOULD CALL EXPLOSIVE GROWTH OF

00:37:28.045 --> 00:37:30.648
SOLAR ACROSS THE STATE AND

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:32.350
DURING THAT PERIOD WE HAD

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:34.452
INCREASES OF ABOUT ONE TO TWO

00:37:34.518 --> 00:37:36.220
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR PER

00:37:36.287 --> 00:37:40.424
YEAR AND FRANKLY WE'RE

00:37:40.491 --> 00:37:42.493
OF INCREASES OF THIS FOUR HOUR

00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:46.330
DURATION- BUT YOUR MIND STORAGE

00:37:46.397 --> 00:37:49.433
OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS- SO. I

00:37:49.500 --> 00:37:50.668
WANTED TO STAGE A LITTLE BIT

00:37:50.735 --> 00:37:53.237
AND PERHAPS THE QUESTION OF WHY

00:37:53.304 --> 00:37:54.639
ARE WE HERE TODAY WELL WE'RE

00:37:54.705 --> 00:37:56.107
HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT

00:37:56.173 --> 00:37:58.476
SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE. AND

00:37:58.542 --> 00:38:00.878
THE FIRST THING THAT I WOULD

00:38:00.945 --> 00:38:02.213
KNOW IS THAT THE DATE. THE

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:03.714
LITTLE STORAGE IS NOT SOMETHING

00:38:03.781 --> 00:38:06.083
THAT NECESSARILY DEFINED BY THE

00:38:06.150 --> 00:38:07.718
CALIFORNIA ISO IT'S NOT

00:38:07.785 --> 00:38:08.786
SOMETHING THAT'S NECESSARILY

00:38:08.853 --> 00:38:10.488
DEFINED BY THE CALIFORNIA

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:12.823
PUBLIC UTILITIES CMMISSION-

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.258
AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:38:14.325 --> 00:38:15.660
KNOW WE HAVE ON OUR GREAT TODAY

00:38:15.726 --> 00:38:16.527
AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WERE

00:38:16.594 --> 00:38:18.596
OPERATING. SO I THINK- THE

00:38:18.663 --> 00:38:20.464
FRAMEWORK THAT ASSEMBLY MAKE

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:21.732
WORK SET UP AT THE BEGINNING OF

00:38:21.799 --> 00:38:23.968
THIS CALL IS EXACTLY CORRECT.

00:38:24.035 --> 00:38:25.803
WE'RE VERY MUCH IN THE

00:38:25.870 --> 00:38:27.505
EXPERIMENTAL AND THEORETICAL

00:38:27.571 --> 00:38:30.174
PHASES OF. WHAT THIS TECHNOLOGY

00:38:30.241 --> 00:38:32.109
COULD POTENTIALLY DO IN THE

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:34.311
FUTURE AND WE'RE NOT YET AT A

00:38:34.378 --> 00:38:36.914
POINT WHERE. WE'RE REALLY

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:39.517
CONSIDERING- IT WERE LOOKING

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:41.519
ACTUAL OPERATIONAL DATA FOR

00:38:41.585 --> 00:38:43.154
THESE RESOURCES- SO WE SHOULD

00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:45.423
KEEP THIS IN MIND- THAT RIGHT

00:38:45.489 --> 00:38:46.957
NOW IT'S PRIMARILY AN ACADEMIC

00:38:47.024 --> 00:38:48.559
EXERCISE. BUT AS WE'VE SEEN

00:38:48.626 --> 00:38:49.627
OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS EVEN

00:38:49.694 --> 00:38:51.529
WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF BUT

00:38:51.595 --> 00:38:52.897
YEAH MY ON BATTERIES AT SHORTER

00:38:52.963 --> 00:38:55.800
DURATION LEVINE BATTERIES- THAT

00:38:55.866 --> 00:38:57.401
WE CAN GO VERY QUICKLY FROM

00:38:57.468 --> 00:39:00.037
ACADEMIC EXERCISES. TO ACTUALLY

00:39:00.104 --> 00:39:01.205
IMPLEMENTING THESE RESOURCES ON

00:39:01.272 --> 00:39:03.407
THE GRANT. EXISTENTIALLY USING

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:06.944
THEM TO RETIRE TRADITIONAL

00:39:07.011 --> 00:39:09.346
RESOURCES- THAT ARE EITHER OLD

00:39:09.413 --> 00:39:14.485
WORK POTENTIALLY- MORE

00:39:14.552 --> 00:39:15.486
POLLUTING THAN OTHERS. SO WHY

00:39:15.553 --> 00:39:17.655
IS ENERGY NECESSARY I THINK

00:39:17.722 --> 00:39:19.623
THAT'S ONE OF THE CRITICAL

00:39:19.690 --> 00:39:20.558
QUESTIONS THAT WE NEED TO ASK

00:39:20.624 --> 00:39:22.693
OURSELVES. AND ENGINEERS

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.495
WORKING THIS QUESTION IS YOU

00:39:24.562 --> 00:39:27.131
KNOW RIGHT AT THE DOORSTEP SB

00:39:27.198 --> 00:39:27.665
ONE HUNDRED WHERE WE HAVE

00:39:27.732 --> 00:39:29.533
REQUIREMENTS TO GET A 100%

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:31.302
GREENHOUSE GAS. FREE

00:39:31.368 --> 00:39:34.405
ELECTRICITY GENERATION BY

00:39:34.472 --> 00:39:34.972
TWENTY FORTY FIVE THIS IS A

00:39:35.039 --> 00:39:36.807
PROBLEM THAT- THE CALIFORNIA

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.542
ENERGY COMMISSION CALIFORNIA

00:39:38.609 --> 00:39:40.277
PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION IN

00:39:40.344 --> 00:39:42.680
CALIFORNIA I ALSO ARE THINKING

00:39:42.747 --> 00:39:45.649
ABOUT VERY HARD- AND HAD AND

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:49.353
TRYING TO. NAVIGATE OUR WAY.

00:39:49.420 --> 00:39:51.655
TOWARD HALF THAT WE CAN GET TO

00:39:51.722 --> 00:39:56.127
A SOLUTION- TO HAVE G. H. G.

00:39:56.193 --> 00:39:57.928
FREE ELECTRICITY GENERATION. SO

00:39:57.995 --> 00:39:59.497
IN THE NEAR TERM WHAT THAT

00:39:59.563 --> 00:40:01.832
MEANS IS RETIRED YET IT COULD

00:40:01.899 --> 00:40:03.868
DISCERN THIS ON THIS PROCESS IN

00:40:03.934 --> 00:40:05.102
THE NEAR TERM WHAT THAT MEANS

00:40:05.169 --> 00:40:07.671
IS RETIREMENT- VERY OLD AND

00:40:07.738 --> 00:40:09.206
EXPENSIVE AND NOT PARTICULARLY

00:40:09.273 --> 00:40:11.142
EFFICIENT AFTER GAS GENERATING

00:40:11.208 --> 00:40:13.477
RESOURCES AND REPLACING THOSE

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:16.180
RESOURCES IN AN IDEAL WORLD-

00:40:16.247 --> 00:40:17.748
WITH SOME SORT OF A TECHNOLOGY

00:40:17.815 --> 00:40:19.483
THAT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

00:40:19.550 --> 00:40:22.787
FREE. OKAY CALIFORNIA TODAY I

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.121
HAVE NEVER MENTION THIS

00:40:24.188 --> 00:40:26.557
AFFECTED WE MEAN- REPLACING IT

00:40:26.624 --> 00:40:28.159
WITH WIND OR SOLAR GENERATION

00:40:28.225 --> 00:40:31.128
OF SOME VARIETY. UNFORTUNATELY

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:32.329
AND I'M REALLY HOPING THAT THIS

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.331
ISN'T NEWS TO ANYBODY- WE

00:40:34.398 --> 00:40:36.834
ALREADY HAVE A LOT OF SOLAR

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:39.003
RESOURCES ON OUR SYSTEM TODAY

00:40:39.069 --> 00:40:40.638
AND ADDITIONAL GENERATION FROM

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:44.074
SOLAR- COULD POTENTIALLY. PUT

00:40:44.141 --> 00:40:46.277
THE SYSTEM IN A POSITION WHERE

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:47.611
WE HAVE SATURATION DURING SOME

00:40:47.678 --> 00:40:50.481
HOURS OR EVEN SOME OF THE YEAR-

00:40:50.548 --> 00:40:52.316
TODAY YOU GOING INTO SPRING IS

00:40:52.383 --> 00:40:53.918
ALREADY NOTED IN THE

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:55.586
INTRODUCTORY COMMENTS WE DO

00:40:55.653 --> 00:40:57.721
HAVE A FREQUENT NEED THAT

00:40:57.788 --> 00:40:58.989
BACKGROUND SOLAR GENERATION FOR

00:40:59.056 --> 00:41:00.825
PEAK OUTPUT AND THIS IS ALREADY

00:41:00.891 --> 00:41:03.527
HAPPENING- BECAUSE WE ARE

00:41:03.594 --> 00:41:06.230
GENERATING MORE SOLAR ENERGY

00:41:06.297 --> 00:41:12.503
THAN IS NEEDED. TO SERVE HELLO

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:13.070
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA-

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:14.371
THIS OCCURS FOR THREE. REASONS

00:41:14.438 --> 00:41:16.140
THERE'S OTHER. THAT THAT PLAY A

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:17.675
ROLE AS WELL. BUT IN THE SPRING

00:41:17.741 --> 00:41:19.844
WE DO TYPICALLY. HI SOLAR HIGH

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:22.479
ENOUGH STORAGE IN GENERAL- SO

00:41:22.546 --> 00:41:23.948
WE HAVE MORE SUPPLY. WE ALSO

00:41:24.014 --> 00:41:26.750
HAVE SPRINGTIME RUNOFF SO THE

00:41:26.817 --> 00:41:28.185
ICE AND SNOW IS MELTING OF THE

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:30.454
MOUNTAINS THAT INCREASING THE

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:32.122
GENERATION THAT WE GET FROM OUR

00:41:32.189 --> 00:41:34.158
RUN OF RIVER HYDRO RESOURCES

00:41:34.225 --> 00:41:35.492
WHICH IS ALSO INCREASING THE

00:41:35.559 --> 00:41:37.428
SUPPLY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

00:41:37.494 --> 00:41:38.729
IN THE FINAL IN THE SPRING WE

00:41:38.796 --> 00:41:39.830
ALSO TYPICALLY HAVE COOLER

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:42.366
WEATHER WHICH TRANSLATES TO LOW

00:41:42.433 --> 00:41:44.501
OR MODERATE LOWS. ACROSS THE

00:41:44.568 --> 00:41:49.640
SYSTEM. AND THIS MEANS THAT-

00:41:49.707 --> 00:41:51.709
YEAH ONE FACT. THAT CALL. IT

00:41:51.775 --> 00:41:54.011
JUST OVER GENERATIONS OF

00:41:54.078 --> 00:41:57.348
ELECTRICITY- SO RIGHT NOW-

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:59.016
DURING THOSE SUMMER TIME

00:41:59.083 --> 00:42:00.618
PERIODS WHEN WE HAVE OUR

00:42:00.684 --> 00:42:01.986
ABSOLUTE HIGHEST HE NEED FOR

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:05.556
THE SEASON- WE HAVE JUST ENOUGH

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:07.591
AGGREGATE GENERATION TO MEET

00:42:07.658 --> 00:42:09.093
THOSE NEEDS YEAH THERE ARE

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:11.528
EVENING HOURS- NEED NEED

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.063
TYPICALLY OCCUR AFTER THE SUN

00:42:13.130 --> 00:42:15.900
GOES DOWN. SO EFFECTIVELY IF WE

00:42:15.966 --> 00:42:17.201
BROUGHT ON HUNDRED TONS AND

00:42:17.268 --> 00:42:18.969
TONS OF NEW SOLAR IT WOULD

00:42:19.036 --> 00:42:21.405
REALLY HELP US MEET THE NEEDS-

00:42:21.472 --> 00:42:22.539
BECAUSE WE REALLY NEED THE

00:42:22.606 --> 00:42:23.707
ENERGY AFTER THE SOLAR IS

00:42:23.774 --> 00:42:25.776
ALREADY OFFLINE FOR THE DAY- SO

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.311
WHAT CAN POTENTIALLY DO

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:29.647
OBVIOUSLY THE ANSWER IS- YEAH

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.382
IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. SHORT

00:42:31.448 --> 00:42:32.950
DURATION BATTERY SO IF WE DO

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:35.753
INTEGRATE MEANS- LITHIUM ION

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:36.687
FOUR HOUR DURATION BATTERIES

00:42:36.754 --> 00:42:38.222
LIKE WE'RE DOING ON OUR SYSTEM

00:42:38.289 --> 00:42:40.324
TODAY WE CAN SOLVE THIS PROBLEM

00:42:40.391 --> 00:42:41.659
WE CAN BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:42.860
THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY WHEN WE

00:42:42.927 --> 00:42:45.529
GOT SOLAR ONLINE AND IN THE END

00:42:45.596 --> 00:42:46.997
OF THE DAY AFTER SORTS OFFLINE

00:42:47.064 --> 00:42:48.399
WILL BE HAVE A GREATER NEED FOR

00:42:48.465 --> 00:42:50.668
GENERATION. AND THEN MORE STILL

00:42:50.734 --> 00:42:52.102
AFFECTED WE GETTING HI THERE

00:42:52.169 --> 00:42:54.038
ARE- VERY LOW COSTS ARE VERY

00:42:54.104 --> 00:42:55.973
EFFICIENT GAS GENERATION OR

00:42:56.040 --> 00:42:57.274
POTENTIALLY ON THOSE DAYS AND

00:42:57.341 --> 00:42:59.777
WE HAVE SOLAR CURTAILMENT-

00:42:59.843 --> 00:43:00.778
WE'RE GETTING ACCESS SOLAR

00:43:00.844 --> 00:43:02.346
INTEGRATED WOULD HAVE OTHERWISE

00:43:02.413 --> 00:43:03.914
NOT BEEN ABLE TO GENERATE AND

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:06.417
STORE- STORED IN ELECTRONIC

00:43:06.483 --> 00:43:08.552
BATTERIES AND THEN THEY CAN BE

00:43:08.619 --> 00:43:16.060
USED AND DISPATCH. UNDERGRAD AT

00:43:16.126 --> 00:43:17.294
A LATER POINT IN THE DAY. SO

00:43:17.361 --> 00:43:20.631
RIGHT NOW FOUR INVESTMENT IN ME-

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:21.498
THE NEED IS AT THE OF THE DAY

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:25.536
AND AT- JUST JUST FOR TARGETED.

00:43:25.602 --> 00:43:27.104
BUT AS WE GET DEEPER AND DEEPER

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.672
STORAGE PENETRATION ON THE

00:43:28.739 --> 00:43:29.940
GRAND EVENTUALLY WE'RE GONNA

00:43:30.007 --> 00:43:31.875
NEED STORAGE THAT PROVIDE

00:43:31.942 --> 00:43:33.811
SERVICES FOR MORE THAN JUST A

00:43:33.877 --> 00:43:35.946
FEW HOURS OF THE DAY- AND

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:36.947
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE OFFERING TO

00:43:37.014 --> 00:43:38.215
OR IS TYPICALLY REFERRED TO AN

00:43:38.282 --> 00:43:40.150
INDUSTRY AS- LONGER RATIONS

00:43:40.217 --> 00:43:42.019
STORAGE SO WE'RE EVENTUALLY

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:43.754
GOING TO NEED BATTERIES THAT

00:43:43.821 --> 00:43:45.823
ARE CAPABLE OF. PROVIDING EIGHT

00:43:45.889 --> 00:43:47.257
HOURS A STORAGE DURATION OR TEN

00:43:47.324 --> 00:43:48.692
HOURS OF STORAGE DURATION OR

00:43:48.759 --> 00:43:51.762
EVEN MORE- AGAIN AS WE GET MORE

00:43:51.829 --> 00:43:52.763
RETIREMENT OF TRADITIONAL

00:43:52.830 --> 00:43:54.798
RESOURCES AND START REPLACING

00:43:54.865 --> 00:43:57.301
THEM WITH RENEWABLE RESOURCES

00:43:57.368 --> 00:43:59.703
WIND OR SOLAR- AND TO BE HAPPY

00:43:59.770 --> 00:44:01.805
BATTERIES TO COLLECT EXCESS

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.774
WIND OR SOLAR- FROM THAT

00:44:03.841 --> 00:44:06.310
GENERATION AND THEN. MOVED TO

00:44:06.377 --> 00:44:07.644
ACTIVELY MOVE THAT INTERVIEW

00:44:07.711 --> 00:44:10.681
FROM ONE TIME OF THE DAY TO THE

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:12.649
OTHER SIDE OF THE DAY- IF WE

00:44:12.716 --> 00:44:17.021
YOU KNOW- I WOULD ALSO SAY THAT.

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:19.156
AS WE GO FURTHER IN THE FUTURE-

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.858
WE'RE IN WE'RE GOING TO START

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.493
THE FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES ARE

00:44:22.559 --> 00:44:25.295
GRANTED THE BIGGEST AT NEED ARE

00:44:25.362 --> 00:44:27.831
GOING TO SHIFT FROM- THAT THOSE

00:44:27.898 --> 00:44:30.634
SUMMER VERY HIGH HEAT DAYS TO

00:44:30.701 --> 00:44:32.436
ACTUALLY- THE WINTER WHEN WE

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:34.004
HAVE POTENTIALLY LOWER SOLAR

00:44:34.071 --> 00:44:36.473
GENERATION YET AGAIN AL GORE

00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:40.944
RICH. MAKEUP CHANGES WILL HAVE-

00:44:41.011 --> 00:44:42.479
PLENTY OF OTHER SOLAR

00:44:42.546 --> 00:44:43.914
GENERATION IN THE SUMMER WHEN

00:44:43.981 --> 00:44:45.516
THE SUN IS ABUNDANT BUT IN THE

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:46.417
WINTER WHEN DAYS ARE MUCH

00:44:46.483 --> 00:44:47.518
SHORTER AND SO WE'RE

00:44:47.584 --> 00:44:49.686
GENERATIONS LAST WILL START TO

00:44:49.753 --> 00:44:51.822
FEEL THE PINCH- IN THE

00:44:51.889 --> 00:44:53.290
OVERNIGHT HOURS WHEN THERE'S NO

00:44:53.357 --> 00:44:55.692
SOLAR GENERATION- AND IT COULD

00:44:55.759 --> 00:44:56.994
POTENTIALLY BE EXACERBATED BY

00:44:57.061 --> 00:44:57.861
FEAR IS WHEN THERE'S VERY

00:44:57.928 --> 00:44:59.730
LITTLE WIND DURING THE DURING

00:44:59.797 --> 00:45:02.132
OUR CROSS ENTIRE DAY AND THAT'S

00:45:02.199 --> 00:45:04.368
REALLY THE TIME FRAME WHEN WE

00:45:04.435 --> 00:45:05.736
START TO SEE A SHIFT FROM THE

00:45:05.803 --> 00:45:07.971
NEED. FOR STORAGE RATIO AND

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.740
THAT IS PERHAPS ONLY A FEW

00:45:09.807 --> 00:45:12.109
HOURS- TWO ONE THAT COULD

00:45:12.176 --> 00:45:14.111
POTENTIALLY STAND- FOR MOVING

00:45:14.178 --> 00:45:15.846
ENERGY DURING THESE RELATIVELY

00:45:15.913 --> 00:45:17.514
ABUNDANT TIMES PERHAPS IN THE

00:45:17.581 --> 00:45:24.321
SUMMER- FOR THE FALL. YEAH IN

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:25.255
THE WINTER. WHEN THERE'S NOT A

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:25.823
WHOLE LOT OF SO WE'RE GONNA

00:45:25.889 --> 00:45:27.458
WHICH STATE WILL BE RELY ON. AS

00:45:27.524 --> 00:45:29.326
WE SEE OUR RENEWAL GENERATION

00:45:29.393 --> 00:45:31.929
SOLAR GENERATION INCREASE OVER

00:45:31.995 --> 00:45:33.964
THE YEARS- SO IF WE WERE LIKE

00:45:34.031 --> 00:45:36.733
IN THE TO A MARATHON RACE. I

00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:39.336
WOULD SAY- AMERICAN RACING THE

00:45:39.403 --> 00:45:41.438
RACE WAS- WHERE WE ARE IT'S

00:45:41.505 --> 00:45:43.340
EARNS OUT THINKING ABOUT AND

00:45:43.407 --> 00:45:44.641
MOVING TOWARDS DIFFERENT

00:45:44.708 --> 00:45:46.243
STORAGE SOLUTIONS WELL

00:45:46.310 --> 00:45:48.078
BASICALLY JUST GETTING OFF THE

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.280
STARTING BLOCK- WE'RE LEARNING

00:45:50.347 --> 00:45:53.016
HOW BATTERIES OPERATOR GRANT WE

00:45:53.083 --> 00:45:55.285
STARTED TO DESIGN MODEL THAT

00:45:55.352 --> 00:45:56.520
CAN ACCOMMODATE STORAGE

00:45:56.587 --> 00:45:59.990
RESOURCES ON OUR GREAT. AND AS

00:46:00.057 --> 00:46:01.625
THOSE MODELS. YEAH YOU KNOW

00:46:01.692 --> 00:46:02.860
WHAT FORMING OF MODEL AND THERE

00:46:02.926 --> 00:46:05.529
THEY WILL IMPROVE AND OF ALL TO

00:46:05.596 --> 00:46:07.164
ACCOMMODATE THE DIFFERENT KINDS

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:08.899
OF FUNCTIONS THAT BATTERIES CAN

00:46:08.966 --> 00:46:10.934
PERFORM- BUT THAT DOES TAKE

00:46:11.001 --> 00:46:13.470
TIME AND- EFFORT. AND

00:46:13.537 --> 00:46:15.906
EVENTUALLY WILL START YOU NEED

00:46:15.973 --> 00:46:17.374
THESE OTHER KINDS OF STORAGE

00:46:17.441 --> 00:46:19.009
RESOURCES AS WELL MIDWAY

00:46:19.076 --> 00:46:19.910
THROUGH THE RACE WILL BE

00:46:19.977 --> 00:46:22.146
THINKING ABOUT- LONGER DURATION

00:46:22.212 --> 00:46:23.614
STORAGE IN THAT EVENTUALLY

00:46:23.680 --> 00:46:24.848
TOWARD THE END OF THE RACE.

00:46:24.915 --> 00:46:26.316
WELL WHO WILL START YOU NEED TO

00:46:26.383 --> 00:46:28.519
THINK ABOUT- SEASONAL STORAGE

00:46:28.585 --> 00:46:30.053
AND HOW THAT PLAYS INTO MARKETS

00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.522
BUT WE'RE VERY VERY LONG WAY

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:32.689
OFF FROM DOING THAT AT THIS

00:46:32.756 --> 00:46:35.759
POINT- IT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:36.326
OF EXTRA STUDY AND A LOT OF

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:38.061
EXTRA RESEARCH. YOU KNOW HOW

00:46:38.128 --> 00:46:39.897
THESE ARE GOING TO HATE AND TO

00:46:39.963 --> 00:46:41.431
SET UP THE RIGHT INCENTIVES. TO

00:46:41.498 --> 00:46:42.332
GET THE PROPER RESOURCES

00:46:42.399 --> 00:46:45.669
ONLINE- AND THEN THE RIGHT

00:46:45.736 --> 00:46:47.371
MARKET TOOLS IN PLACE. THAT WE

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:48.372
CAN USE THESE RESOURCES

00:46:48.438 --> 00:46:50.307
PROPERLY AND EFFECTIVELY TO GET

00:46:50.374 --> 00:46:56.547
ELECTRICITY. THIS CALIFORNIA.

00:46:56.613 --> 00:47:01.018
I'M SHE ARTS ABOUT MINUTES TEN-

00:47:01.084 --> 00:47:02.319
SO PROUD AWHILE FOR OF ALL I'M

00:47:02.386 --> 00:47:03.353
JUST COULD TO TRY AND ADD A

00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:05.455
COUPLE OF POINTS TO AUDIENCE

00:47:05.522 --> 00:47:06.823
MAY NOT FOR BEING FAMILIAR WITH

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.759
THE TECHNOLOGY YOU CAN'T REALLY

00:47:08.825 --> 00:47:10.727
USE BATTERIES TO STORE POWER

00:47:10.794 --> 00:47:12.029
FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS AND

00:47:12.095 --> 00:47:13.997
MONTHS YOU GET SELF DISCHARGE

00:47:14.064 --> 00:47:15.566
WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH LITHIUM

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.334
AND COBALT AND OTHER MATERIALS

00:47:17.401 --> 00:47:19.536
TO MAKE BATTERIES WHICH CAN

00:47:19.603 --> 00:47:20.971
STORE THING FOR MONTHS IT'S

00:47:21.038 --> 00:47:23.807
JUST NOT SOMETHING THAT IS.

00:47:23.874 --> 00:47:26.143
LIKELY TO HAPPEN. WE'RE TALKING

00:47:26.210 --> 00:47:27.911
ABOUT LITHIUM ION BATTERIES

00:47:27.978 --> 00:47:29.046
THERE ARE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES

00:47:29.112 --> 00:47:30.781
WHICH WILL GET INTO WHICH-

00:47:30.847 --> 00:47:33.116
BATTERY ORIENTED SUCH AS- FLOW

00:47:33.183 --> 00:47:34.985
BATTERIES AT CETERA BUT- THE

00:47:35.052 --> 00:47:37.421
CURRENT TECHNOLOGY IS NOT ONE

00:47:37.487 --> 00:47:38.055
THAT'S GOING TO STORE THING FOR

00:47:38.121 --> 00:47:40.224
MONTHS. THE OTHER THING IS IF

00:47:40.290 --> 00:47:41.758
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A WINTER

00:47:41.825 --> 00:47:44.261
DAY WHERE THERE'S AND- YOU'VE

00:47:44.328 --> 00:47:45.996
DONE A GREAT JOB WITH THE ISO

00:47:46.063 --> 00:47:47.497
SHOWING THE WINTER DAYS WITH NO

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:49.433
SIGN AND NO WIND. THAT THIS

00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:51.301
HAPPENS YOU'RE REALLY TALKING

00:47:51.368 --> 00:47:55.138
ABOUT MANY GIGAWATTS. OF WET

00:47:55.205 --> 00:47:56.573
SUMMER DEMAND IS ACHIEVING

00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:57.908
WINNER DEMAND IS PROBABLY

00:47:57.975 --> 00:47:59.710
THIRTY GIGAWATT THIRTY

00:47:59.776 --> 00:48:02.412
GIGAWATTS- THIRTY THOUSAND

00:48:02.479 --> 00:48:03.647
MEGAWATTS SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:04.915
AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:04.982 --> 00:48:09.486
PERHAPS- SOMETHING LIKE-

00:48:09.553 --> 00:48:11.855
GEOTHERMAL WHICH IS BASELOAD

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:13.056
PERHAPS SOME OTHER BASELOAD

00:48:13.123 --> 00:48:15.058
TECHNOLOGIES WERE DEVELOPED BUT

00:48:15.125 --> 00:48:16.526
WE'RE TALKING ON THE ORDER OF

00:48:16.593 --> 00:48:18.061
TENS OF GIGAWATTS TENS OF

00:48:18.128 --> 00:48:20.264
THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.932
GENERATION NEEDED. AND WE'RE

00:48:21.999 --> 00:48:23.567
TALKING ABOUT IT FOR PERIODS OF

00:48:23.634 --> 00:48:27.571
DAYS. MAYBE WEEKS- IF YOU LOOK

00:48:27.638 --> 00:48:29.740
AT THE MOST EXTREME CASE AND WE

00:48:29.806 --> 00:48:31.441
KNOW WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE

00:48:31.508 --> 00:48:33.277
WITHOUT ELECTRICITY FOR EVEN A

00:48:33.343 --> 00:48:36.280
SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FOR HEALTH

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:38.415
SAFETY AND ECONOMIC REASONS. SO

00:48:38.482 --> 00:48:39.916
WE REALLY ARE TALKING ABOUT

00:48:39.983 --> 00:48:43.787
HERE OF. GIGAWATTS OF CAPACITY

00:48:43.854 --> 00:48:45.322
THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF

00:48:45.389 --> 00:48:48.492
CAPACITY ON THE ORDER OF CHANCE

00:48:48.558 --> 00:48:49.059
TEN TO TWENTY SOMEWHERE IN

00:48:49.126 --> 00:48:50.961
THERE PROBABLY. AND WE ARE

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:52.996
TALKING ABOUT STORAGE FOR AT

00:48:53.063 --> 00:48:55.299
LEAST WEEKS. AS OPPOSED TO

00:48:55.365 --> 00:48:59.803
HOURS MAYBE FOR MONTHS. IT'S

00:48:59.870 --> 00:49:00.971
JUST AN ORDER OF MAGNITUDE

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:03.940
DIFFERENT AND I JUST GO- I

00:49:04.007 --> 00:49:06.276
THINK THAT- AS AN EXPERT- YOU

00:49:06.343 --> 00:49:07.811
WERE IMPLYING THIS BUT I JUST

00:49:07.878 --> 00:49:09.880
WANTED TO GET THAT POINT ACROSS

00:49:09.946 --> 00:49:13.650
TO THE AUDIENCE- I'D NOW LIKE

00:49:13.717 --> 00:49:16.987
TO OPEN THIS FOR QUESTIONS-

00:49:17.054 --> 00:49:21.692
MISTER CHANNEL. ANYONE NOW-

00:49:21.758 --> 00:49:26.163
WELL. QUESTION BUT I THINK UP

00:49:26.229 --> 00:49:27.497
PLEASE DO THINK I'D LIKE TO

00:49:27.564 --> 00:49:28.732
HEAR THE OTHER SPEAKERS FIRST

00:49:28.799 --> 00:49:30.033
BEFORE I GET INTO THE QUESTION

00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.704
OKAY MAKE SURE GOING TO COVER-

00:49:33.770 --> 00:49:35.605
SO I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN. TO

00:49:35.672 --> 00:49:38.742
THAT POINT- I REALLY. YOU KNOW

BECAUSE THIS IS SUCH AN

00:51:33.557 --> 00:51:36.726
EXCITING TIME FOR- THE INDUSTRY

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.128
WITH THE TRANSITION INTO A NEW

00:51:38.195 --> 00:51:39.463
ENERGY SYSTEM CAN YOU CONFIRM

00:51:39.529 --> 00:51:41.498
THAT YOU CAN BOTH HEAR ME AND

00:51:41.565 --> 00:51:44.367
SEE MY SLIDE OKAY. YES OKAY SO

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:45.769
I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.504
ABOUT SEASONAL ENERGY STORAGE

00:51:47.571 --> 00:51:49.272
WHICH IS A NECESSITY FOR AS LOW

00:51:49.339 --> 00:51:51.041
CARBON GRID. BUT I'D LIKE TO

00:51:51.107 --> 00:51:52.609
START BY POINTING OUT THAT

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.778
ENERGY STORAGE IS A NECESSITY

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:57.080
FOR ANY ANY ENERGY SYSTEM. AND

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:59.049
EFFECTIVE DAY IF YOU LOOK THE

00:51:59.115 --> 00:52:01.718
EIA MAINTAINS A DASHBOARD TO

00:52:01.785 --> 00:52:04.054
TRACK THE NATURAL GAS STORAGE

00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:04.821
CONCEDED DIFFERENT REGIONS OF

00:52:04.888 --> 00:52:06.890
THE COUNTRY. HERE YOU CAN SEE

00:52:06.957 --> 00:52:08.725
OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEAR.

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:11.294
THE STORAGE IN THE UNDERGROUND-

00:52:11.361 --> 00:52:13.163
IN NATURAL GAS STORAGE IT WILL

00:52:13.230 --> 00:52:14.865
DECREASE DURING THE WINTER AS

00:52:14.931 --> 00:52:16.399
IT'S USED FOR HEATING AND THEN

00:52:16.466 --> 00:52:19.202
OVER THE SUMMER. THE REFILL

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:21.004
THAT CAVERN WITH MORE NATURAL

00:52:21.071 --> 00:52:23.907
GAS THEY ALSO TRACK- OIL AND

00:52:23.974 --> 00:52:27.677
OTHER THINGS AND HERE I HAVE. A

00:52:27.744 --> 00:52:29.679
COLLECTION OF ALL THE DIFFERENT

00:52:29.746 --> 00:52:31.414
THINGS THAT YOU CAN SEE. WITH

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:34.985
THE- DIFFERENT TYPES OF STORAGE

00:52:35.051 --> 00:52:36.520
RESERVOIRS AND IF YOU LOOK AT

00:52:36.586 --> 00:52:37.854
THIS IN TERMS OF IF YOU TOOK

00:52:37.921 --> 00:52:40.257
THIS ENERGY IN THESE AND USED

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:42.058
IT TO POWER THE ELECTRICITY

00:52:42.125 --> 00:52:44.928
GRID WE COULD POWER THE US

00:52:44.995 --> 00:52:47.197
POWER GRID FOR ALMOST A HALF A

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:49.099
YEAR WITH THESE RESEARCH CENTER

00:52:49.165 --> 00:52:51.167
THERE. SO INTERESTING QUESTION

00:52:51.234 --> 00:52:53.336
IS WHO PAYS FOR THE STORAGE THE

00:52:53.403 --> 00:52:55.038
CUSTOMERS WHO GET THAT NATURAL

00:52:55.105 --> 00:52:56.740
GAS IF IT WAS STORED DURING THE

00:52:56.806 --> 00:52:58.475
SUMMER AND THEN THAT STILL PER

00:52:58.542 --> 00:52:59.209
TO THEM WITH WINTER HEAT

00:52:59.276 --> 00:53:00.810
THEY'LL PAY A LITTLE BIT EXTRA

00:53:00.877 --> 00:53:02.546
FOR THE WINTER. TIME NATURAL

00:53:02.612 --> 00:53:03.880
GAS BECAUSE THE PRICES ARE

00:53:03.947 --> 00:53:06.716
HIGHER IN THE WINTER- BUT IF

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:08.018
YOU LOOK AT SAY THE STRATEGIC

00:53:08.084 --> 00:53:09.719
PETROLEUM RESERVE AND IF YOU'VE

00:53:09.786 --> 00:53:11.054
BEEN AROUND AS LONG AS I HAVE

00:53:11.121 --> 00:53:12.522
YOU REMEMBER THE OPEC OIL

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.391
EMBARGO SOME YEARS AGO WHICH

00:53:14.457 --> 00:53:16.393
MOTIVATED US TO CREATE THIS.

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.794
IT'S REALLY THERE FOR NATIONAL

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:19.829
SECURITY WHEN PEOPLE DO THE

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:22.265
MODELING TO SAY WHAT'S THE COST

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.467
OF STORAGE WE NEED TO MEET TO

00:53:24.534 --> 00:53:25.602
BE ABLE TO PAY FOR THAT

00:53:25.669 --> 00:53:27.604
STORAGE. IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:53:27.671 --> 00:53:29.839
LENGTH OF TIME THE ENERGY HAS

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:30.740
BEEN IN THAT STRATEGIC

00:53:30.807 --> 00:53:32.609
PETROLEUM RESERVE AND WHETHER

00:53:32.676 --> 00:53:33.677
IT COULD MAKE A RETURN ON

00:53:33.743 --> 00:53:35.745
INVESTMENT- YOU'LL FIND THAT

00:53:35.812 --> 00:53:36.680
NOBODY CAN MAKE A BUSINESS

00:53:36.746 --> 00:53:38.381
MODEL OUT OF THIS IT'S NOT A

00:53:38.448 --> 00:53:39.749
BUSINESS MODEL FOR BEING ABLE

00:53:39.816 --> 00:53:41.651
TO DO ENERGY SALES IT'S THERE

00:53:41.718 --> 00:53:43.920
FOR NATIONAL SECURITY. SO I

00:53:43.987 --> 00:53:45.088
SUGGEST THAT WHEN WE'RE

00:53:45.155 --> 00:53:47.958
THINKING ABOUT ENERGY STORAGE

00:53:48.024 --> 00:53:49.426
WE NEED TO DIFFERENTIATE

00:53:49.492 --> 00:53:51.127
BETWEEN PRACTICALITY AND

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:53.163
SECURITY. AND I'M THEIR

00:53:53.229 --> 00:53:54.598
DIFFERENT TECHNICAL TERMS YOU

00:53:54.664 --> 00:53:55.966
MAY USE FOR THIS BUT JUST TO

00:53:56.032 --> 00:53:57.801
NOTE PRACTICALITY IS THAT WE

00:53:57.867 --> 00:53:59.703
NEED STORAGE FOR THE NIGHT TIME

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:01.871
AND FOR CLOUDY DAYS WE ALSO

00:54:01.938 --> 00:54:04.574
NEED STORAGE THAT- I CALL

00:54:04.641 --> 00:54:05.742
SEASONAL HERE AND THE

00:54:05.809 --> 00:54:07.744
DIFFERENTIATING OF THESE- CAN

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:09.279
GET A LITTLE COMPLICATED BUT

00:54:09.346 --> 00:54:10.547
THE BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS

00:54:10.614 --> 00:54:14.718
THAT'S HERE FOR SEASONAL. IS

00:54:14.784 --> 00:54:15.852
LARGELY FOR SECURITY. THE WE

00:54:15.919 --> 00:54:16.920
WANT TO HAVE AN INSURANCE

00:54:16.987 --> 00:54:18.622
POLICY AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:54:18.688 --> 00:54:19.923
SCRIPT AGAIN YOU CAN SEE THE

00:54:19.990 --> 00:54:20.957
DURING THE WINTER IT COMES

00:54:21.024 --> 00:54:23.293
DOWN. BUT THIS GRAY AREA IS

00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:25.462
LOOKING AT A FIVE YEAR MINIMUM

00:54:25.528 --> 00:54:27.097
AND MAXIMUM AND WHAT YOU SEE IS

00:54:27.163 --> 00:54:28.498
THAT OVER THE COURSE OF FIVE

00:54:28.565 --> 00:54:30.467
YEARS WE NEVER GO DOWN TO ZERO.

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.502
WE INTENTIONALLY SIZE THE

00:54:32.569 --> 00:54:34.371
STORAGE SO THAT WE NEVER GO

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:35.639
DOWN TO ZERO BECAUSE E WANT

00:54:35.705 --> 00:54:37.807
THE INSURANCE. THAT IF

00:54:37.874 --> 00:54:38.942
SOMETHING REALLY STRANGE

00:54:39.009 --> 00:54:40.276
HAPPENS AND HAVING JUST BEEN

00:54:40.343 --> 00:54:41.411
THROUGH THE PANDEMIC WE CAN ALL

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:43.279
SEE THAT STRANGE THINGS CAN

00:54:43.346 --> 00:54:44.881
HAPPEN. THINGS THAT WE NEVER

00:54:44.948 --> 00:54:46.383
EXPECTED CAN DISRUPT THE SUPPLY

00:54:46.449 --> 00:54:49.252
CHAINS. AND HERE WE BUILT THIS

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:51.154
IN TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR SUPPLY

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.756
CHAIN FOR ENERGY BECAUSE ENERGY

00:54:52.822 --> 00:54:55.392
IS SO FOUNDATIONAL FOR SOCIETY

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:56.426
WE NEED TO HAVE THAT THERE AS

00:54:56.493 --> 00:54:58.161
SECURITY. SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING

00:54:58.228 --> 00:55:00.897
ABOUT SEASONAL- STORAGE I HOPE

00:55:00.964 --> 00:55:03.099
WE CAN BE THINKING ABOUT NOT

00:55:03.166 --> 00:55:05.502
JUST DELIVERING- THAT KILOWATT

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:06.970
HOUR ONCE A YEAR AFTER THAT

00:55:07.037 --> 00:55:08.204
STORAGE IN NEEDING TO PAY FOR

00:55:08.271 --> 00:55:09.406
THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT PAYING

00:55:09.472 --> 00:55:11.241
FOR THE SECURITY. SO KEY

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:12.742
QUESTION TO BE INTERESTING TO

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:14.878
DISCUSS IS WILL DECARBONIZE

00:55:14.944 --> 00:55:17.247
ENERGY SYSTEM NEED MORE FOR

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:19.049
LESS STORAGE HERE WE'RE TALKING

00:55:19.115 --> 00:55:20.684
ABOUT THE TWO DAY IN THE US WE

00:55:20.750 --> 00:55:22.519
HAVE MAYBE SIX MONTHS WORTH. IN

00:55:22.585 --> 00:55:23.953
THE FUTURE WE PROBABLY DON'T

00:55:24.020 --> 00:55:25.021
NEED THE STRATEGIC PETROLEUM

00:55:25.088 --> 00:55:26.556
RESERVE BECAUSE WE HAVE OUR OWN

00:55:26.623 --> 00:55:27.724
SUNSHINE SO WE DON'T NEED TO

00:55:27.791 --> 00:55:29.859
WORRY ABOUT AN OIL EMBARGO. BUT

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:33.129
WE DO NEED TO WORRY ABOUT A BIG

00:55:33.196 --> 00:55:33.663
STORM AND WHAT WILL HAPPEN

00:55:33.730 --> 00:55:35.532
THERE- I'D LIKE TO TALK NEXT

00:55:35.598 --> 00:55:37.934
ABOUT FOUR OF THE REALLY

00:55:38.001 --> 00:55:40.704
EXCITING APPROACHES TO SOLVING-

00:55:40.770 --> 00:55:41.805
AT LEAST PARTS OF THESE

00:55:41.871 --> 00:55:43.506
PROBLEMS. AND THERE ARE SO MANY

00:55:43.573 --> 00:55:44.974
TECHNOLOGIES OUT THERE I COULD-

00:55:45.041 --> 00:55:46.543
TALK ABOUT TODAY I'VE CHOSEN

00:55:46.609 --> 00:55:49.179
THESE FOR- LARGELY BECAUSE I DO

00:55:49.245 --> 00:55:50.980
SEE THAT THEY HAVE. A REAL

00:55:51.047 --> 00:55:53.917
SCALABILITY- AND ALSO BECAUSE

00:55:53.983 --> 00:55:55.185
MAYBE I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT

00:55:55.251 --> 00:55:56.186
BATTERIES TODAY BECAUSE YOU'VE

00:55:56.252 --> 00:55:57.153
ALL HEARD ABOUT BATTERIES SO

00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:58.722
I'VE- CHOSEN THINGS THAT MAYBE

00:55:58.788 --> 00:55:59.889
GIVE YOU A LITTLE DIFFERENT

00:55:59.956 --> 00:56:00.423
PERSPECTIVE THAN WHAT YOU

00:56:00.490 --> 00:56:02.559
TYPICALLY LOOK AT. SO THE FIRST

00:56:02.625 --> 00:56:03.760
STRATEGY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:56:03.827 --> 00:56:06.963
IS USING AS MAKING HYDROGEN. SO

00:56:07.030 --> 00:56:08.732
WE SOMETIMES THINK ABOUT

00:56:08.798 --> 00:56:10.667
BUILDING MORE SOLAR WE JUST

00:56:10.734 --> 00:56:11.835
HEARD ABOUT THAT IF WE BUILD

00:56:11.901 --> 00:56:12.902
MORE SIMILAR THAN WE'RE GOING

00:56:12.969 --> 00:56:14.304
TO HAVE OVER GENERATION AND

00:56:14.370 --> 00:56:15.905
THEN WHAT DO WE DO WITH THAT.

00:56:15.972 --> 00:56:18.007
FIRST I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT I

00:56:18.074 --> 00:56:20.443
DON'T THINK THAT. NECESSARILY

00:56:20.510 --> 00:56:21.845
TURNING THE SOLAR PLANT OFF IS

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:24.080
A BIG DEAL. IT'S TRIVIAL TO

00:56:24.147 --> 00:56:25.448
TURN A SOLAR PLANT OFF IT'S

00:56:25.515 --> 00:56:26.983
HARDER TO TURN A NATURAL GAS

00:56:27.050 --> 00:56:28.685
PLANT OFF THERE'S- WEAR AND

00:56:28.752 --> 00:56:30.019
TEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THE

00:56:30.086 --> 00:56:31.254
NATURAL GAS PLANT TURNING IT ON

00:56:31.321 --> 00:56:32.789
AND OFF IN A COAL PLANT. OR

00:56:32.856 --> 00:56:34.858
NUCLEAR PLANT CAN TAKE LIKE A

00:56:34.924 --> 00:56:35.859
FULL DAY TO TURN THEM ON AND

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:38.561
OFF. I'M IN A PEAKER PLANT MADE

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:40.663
SIT IDLE MOST OF THE YEAR AND

00:56:40.730 --> 00:56:41.598
ONLY GET TURNED ON ONCE IN

00:56:41.664 --> 00:56:44.234
AWHILE. SO IF WE TURN OFF THE

00:56:44.300 --> 00:56:46.136
SEWER PLANT 10% OF THE YEAR IT

00:56:46.202 --> 00:56:46.770
DOESN'T REALLY MAKE ANY

00:56:46.836 --> 00:56:48.037
DIFFERENCE TO THE SOLAR PLANT

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:49.072
ALTHOUGH IT DOES MEAN THERE'S

00:56:49.139 --> 00:56:51.007
pLESS RETURN. TO THE INVESTOR ON

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:53.042
THAT. BUT LET'S SAY IF WE BUILD

00:56:53.109 --> 00:56:55.712
MORE SOLAR. AND WE BUILD MORE

00:56:55.779 --> 00:56:57.080
ELECTROLYTES HERS WHAT I'VE

00:56:57.147 --> 00:56:59.449
DRAWN OVER HERE. IS THE MONTHLY

00:56:59.516 --> 00:57:00.917
ELECTRICITY AS A FUNCTION OF

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:02.252
THE TIME OF YEAR AND HERE'S THE

00:57:02.318 --> 00:57:03.853
MONTHLY GLOW THAT WAS OBSERVED

00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:05.855
IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. IF WE

00:57:05.922 --> 00:57:07.991
SCALED UP THE SOLAR GENERATION

00:57:08.057 --> 00:57:10.193
THAT WE SAW IN TWO THOUSAND

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:11.561
NINETEEN BIG ENOUGH THAT DURING

00:57:11.628 --> 00:57:13.463
THE WINTER MONTHS YOU ACTUALLY

00:57:13.530 --> 00:57:15.865
GENERATE ENOUGH ELECTRICITY. TO

00:57:15.932 --> 00:57:17.200
BE ABLE TO SUPPLY THAT THE

00:57:17.267 --> 00:57:19.202
WINTERTIME MODE. WE HAVE NOW

00:57:19.269 --> 00:57:21.471
ALL THIS EXTRA AND YOU CAN VIEW

00:57:21.538 --> 00:57:22.705
THIS IS A PROBLEM BUT YOU COULD

00:57:22.772 --> 00:57:24.107
VIEW IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY WE

00:57:24.174 --> 00:57:25.742
NEED HYDROGEN WE'RE GOING TO

00:57:25.809 --> 00:57:27.143
NEED HYDROGEN TO DRIVE FUEL

00:57:27.210 --> 00:57:29.546
CELLS TO MAKE FERTILIZER. WE'RE

00:57:29.612 --> 00:57:30.680
GOING TO WANT TO MAKE THAT

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:32.982
HYDROGEN AND SO IF WE LOOK AT

00:57:33.049 --> 00:57:34.517
NOW WE'VE MADE ALL THESE

00:57:34.584 --> 00:57:36.920
ELECTROLYTES HERS. WE CAN USE

00:57:36.986 --> 00:57:38.288
THEM DURING THE TIME WHEN YOU

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.223
SEE THIS YELLOW WE CAN USE THAT

00:57:40.290 --> 00:57:42.458
TO MAKE THE HYDROGEN AND THEN.

00:57:42.525 --> 00:57:43.760
WHEN WE GET INTO THE WINTER WE

00:57:43.827 --> 00:57:45.361
CAN JUST TURN THIS OFF IN FACT

00:57:45.428 --> 00:57:47.230
THEY WANT TO TURN OFF. THE

00:57:47.297 --> 00:57:48.464
ELECTROLYZER IS TO MAKE

00:57:48.531 --> 00:57:50.233
HYDROGEN IT'S ECONOMICAL IF THE

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.235
PRICE OF ELECTRICITY IS LOW BUT

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.203
WHEN THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY

00:57:53.269 --> 00:57:54.704
GOES UP. IT BECOMES

00:57:54.771 --> 00:57:56.272
UNECONOMICAL TO MAKE HYDROGEN

00:57:56.339 --> 00:57:57.307
SO THEY'RE GOING TO WANT TO

00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:59.342
TURN OFF DURING THOSE TIMES. SO

00:57:59.409 --> 00:58:00.910
THESE NEW ELECTRICAL LOADS

00:58:00.977 --> 00:58:03.346
LIKE- AND ELECTROLYZER ENABLES

00:58:03.413 --> 00:58:07.250
US TO USE MORE DEMAND

00:58:07.317 --> 00:58:07.784
MANAGEMENT AND I NOTE THAT

00:58:07.851 --> 00:58:08.351
AROUND THE WORLD THE AND- IN

00:58:08.418 --> 00:58:10.053
HIGH. IS SO THESE ARE EXPENSIVE

00:58:10.119 --> 00:58:11.888
TECHNOLOGIES NOW BUT AS THEY GO

00:58:11.955 --> 00:58:13.990
FORWARD IT WILL BE LESS. IN

00:58:14.057 --> 00:58:16.226
LOOKING NEXT AT- THE OTHER

00:58:16.292 --> 00:58:17.994
TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE ARE

00:58:18.061 --> 00:58:21.331
READY. TO BE SCALED UP. THE WE

00:58:21.397 --> 00:58:23.266
CAN USE COMPRESSED AIR. THERE

00:58:23.333 --> 00:58:24.868
ARE ALREADY TOO LARGE

00:58:24.934 --> 00:58:27.070
COMPRESSED AIR STORAGE SYSTEMS

00:58:27.136 --> 00:58:28.171
THAT HAVE BEEN OPERATING FOR

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:31.074
DECADES. I AM VERY INTRIGUED BY

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.709
HI RESTORE HAS MADE AN

00:58:32.775 --> 00:58:34.577
INNOVATIVE ADVANCED VERSION OF

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:36.179
THE COMPRESSED AIR. WHAT

00:58:36.246 --> 00:58:37.113
THEY'VE DONE IS INSTEAD OF

00:58:37.180 --> 00:58:38.781
USING A SALT CAVERN THERE

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.149
AREN'T THAT MANY PLACES IN THE

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:40.683
WORLD WHERE THERE'S SALT

00:58:40.750 --> 00:58:43.052
CAVERN- LOW IN THE GROUND

00:58:43.119 --> 00:58:44.220
INSTEAD WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS

00:58:44.287 --> 00:58:46.890
TO. GO DOWN AND HOLLOW OUT IN

00:58:46.956 --> 00:58:48.625
AND THE NEED REALLY SOLID ROCK

00:58:48.691 --> 00:58:50.460
SO KEEP IN MIND. THAT WHEN

00:58:50.526 --> 00:58:51.628
YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT DRILLING

00:58:51.694 --> 00:58:53.463
DOWN AND MAYBE BRING IN OIL OUT

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:54.797
FRACKING OR WHATEVER YOU NEED

00:58:54.864 --> 00:58:57.000
REALLY POROUS ROCK. SO YOU CAN

00:58:57.066 --> 00:58:58.468
GET THE OIL TO COME OUT BUT IN

00:58:58.534 --> 00:58:59.535
THIS CASE THEY NEED REALLY

00:58:59.602 --> 00:59:01.337
SOLID ROCK BUT THEY GO DOWN AND

00:59:01.404 --> 00:59:02.772
HOLLOW OUT THAT REALLY SOLID

00:59:02.839 --> 00:59:05.041
ROCK. AND THEN THEY ALSO PUMP-

00:59:05.108 --> 00:59:06.910
THE DRILL HOLE DOWN. AND PUT

00:59:06.976 --> 00:59:08.778
WATER DOWN WITH A BLADDER HERE

00:59:08.845 --> 00:59:10.613
WHICH ALLOWS THEM. TO OPERATE

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:12.181
THIS AT A CONSTANT PRESSURE

00:59:12.248 --> 00:59:14.083
MODE WHICH ALLOWS THEM. TO DO A

00:59:14.150 --> 00:59:15.618
DEEP DISCHARGE WHERE IS THE

00:59:15.685 --> 00:59:17.520
HISTORICAL COMPRESSED AIR. IF

00:59:17.587 --> 00:59:18.855
YOU RUN IT DOWN SO ALMOST ALL

00:59:18.922 --> 00:59:19.956
THE ERRORS OUT OF IT IT DOESN'T

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:21.991
HAVEAS MUCH PRESSURE BUT WITH

00:59:22.058 --> 00:59:22.592
THE BLADDER YOU CAN KEEP THE

00:59:22.659 --> 00:59:24.560
PRESSURE HIGH. BETA PROJECTS

00:59:24.627 --> 00:59:26.129
RUNNING AROUND THE WORLD TO

00:59:26.195 --> 00:59:27.163
DEMONSTRATE THIS NEW

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:28.731
TECHNOLOGY. AND YOU CAN SEE

00:59:28.798 --> 00:59:30.700
IT'S VERY SCALABLE IT'S BUILT

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:32.001
ON BEING ABLE TO DRILL WELLS

00:59:32.068 --> 00:59:34.137
THE OIL INDUSTRY IS LOOKING FOR

00:59:34.203 --> 00:59:36.572
WAYS. TO APPLY THEIR SKILLS TO

00:59:36.639 --> 00:59:38.841
CLEAN ENERGY. AND A USES MINING

00:59:38.908 --> 00:59:41.678
TECHNOLOGY SO IT'S USING THAT

00:59:41.744 --> 00:59:43.079
SKILL SETS AND EQUIPMENT THAT'S

00:59:43.146 --> 00:59:44.514
ALREADY READILY AVAILABLE AND

00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:47.150
VERY SCALABLE- SIMILARLY IF YOU

00:59:47.216 --> 00:59:48.284
TAKE COMPRESSED AIR INTAKE A

00:59:48.351 --> 00:59:50.320
LITTLE FURTHER- YOU COOL IT

00:59:50.386 --> 00:59:52.355
DOWN. IF YOU NO LONGER HAVE TO

00:59:52.422 --> 00:59:54.357
COMPRESS IT SO MUCH- IF YOU

00:59:54.424 --> 00:59:55.625
COULD ENOUGH TO BECOMES LIQUID

00:59:55.692 --> 00:59:59.996
AND MANY OF YOU ARE MOST OF YOU

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:00.563
HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH LIQUID

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.164
NITROGEN. SO MAKING THERE IS

01:00:01.230 --> 01:00:03.466
VERY SO- HI IF YOU POWER IT HAS

01:00:03.533 --> 01:00:05.468
BEEN WORKING ON THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:00:05.535 --> 01:00:07.203
FOR MORE THAN A DECADE. I'M

01:00:07.270 --> 01:00:08.571
THEY STORE THE ENERGY IN THE

01:00:08.638 --> 01:00:09.772
LIQUID AIR AND THEY HAVE

01:00:09.839 --> 01:00:12.608
PROJECTS GOING. IN SPAIN AND

01:00:12.675 --> 01:00:15.645
CHILE AT A UTILITY SCALE SIZE.

01:00:15.712 --> 01:00:17.213
THIS IS A GREAT SCALABLE IT'S

01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:20.183
USING. THE TANKS THAT STORE THE

01:00:20.249 --> 01:00:22.118
CRYOGENIC LIQUIDS ARE

01:00:22.185 --> 01:00:23.519
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME TANKS THAT

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:25.555
YOU USE A FOR LIQUEFIED NATURAL

01:00:25.621 --> 01:00:26.389
GAS AND IF YOU'VE BEEN

01:00:26.456 --> 01:00:28.358
FOLLOWING. THE NATURAL GAS

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:30.093
INDUSTRY YOU KNOW THAT THE HUGE

01:00:30.159 --> 01:00:31.327
DEVELOPMENT IS THAT IN THE

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.429
GOLF. THEY'VE PUT IMPORTS THAT

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:36.265
CANS- LIQUEFIED NATURAL GAS PUT

01:00:36.332 --> 01:00:37.467
IT ON SHIPS AND THEN SHIPPED

01:00:37.533 --> 01:00:38.601
AROUND THE WORLD AND EXPORT

01:00:38.668 --> 01:00:40.703
NATURAL GAS TO OTHER PLACES. SO

01:00:40.770 --> 01:00:42.238
THIS IS TECHNOLOGY THAT'S

01:00:42.305 --> 01:00:43.606
AVAILABLE ON A VERY LARGE

01:00:43.673 --> 01:00:45.842
SCALE. AND AGAIN THE COMPANIES

01:00:45.908 --> 01:00:46.876
WHO HAD BEEN INVESTING IN THE

01:00:46.943 --> 01:00:48.711
FOSSIL FUELS ARE LOOKING FOR

01:00:48.778 --> 01:00:51.014
WAYS TO USE THEIR SKILLS. TO

01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.749
HELP TECHNOLOGIES LIKE THIS. HI

01:00:52.815 --> 01:00:53.883
HE WAS VERY INTERESTED IN

01:00:53.950 --> 01:00:55.852
DOING- PROJECTS INC IN

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:57.754
CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS SOME OF

01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:58.955
THESE OTHER PLACES AROUND THE

01:00:59.022 --> 01:01:01.591
WORLD. NOW THIS- LAST EXAMPLE

01:01:01.657 --> 01:01:03.393
THAT I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU IS

01:01:03.459 --> 01:01:04.260
ONE I WAS VERY SKEPTICAL WHEN I

01:01:04.327 --> 01:01:06.329
FIRST HEARD OF IT. BUT THE MORE

01:01:06.396 --> 01:01:06.896
I'VE LEARNED OF IT THE MORE

01:01:06.963 --> 01:01:09.032
IMPRESSED I AM. WITH THE ENERGY

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.433
IS LOOKING AT STORING THE

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.301
ENERGY AND- BY COMPRESSING THE

01:01:12.368 --> 01:01:14.737
ROCK. WHAT THEY DO IS TO DRILL

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.639
A HOLE DOWN DEEP. AND THEN THEY

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:18.474
<u>&lt;c.magenta&gt;AKE A HORIZONTAL FRACTURE&lt;/c&gt;</u>

01:01:18.541 --> 01:01:20.843
HERE. NOW AGAIN THEY NEED VERY

01:01:20.910 --> 01:01:22.945
SOLID ROCK IF THIS IS POOREST

01:01:23.012 --> 01:01:24.547
ROCK LIKE THE KIND OF ROCK THAT

01:01:24.614 --> 01:01:26.449
YOU FIND IF THERE'S OIL AROUND.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:28.317
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO DRILL DOWN

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:29.685
TO ADAPT THAT PUTS THEM INTO

01:01:29.752 --> 01:01:31.154
POROUS ROCK THEY'RE GOING TO

01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:32.422
DRILL TO A GAP THAT'S REALLY

01:01:32.488 --> 01:01:36.159
SOLID ROCK AND THEY NEED. TO

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:36.793
SEE. THIS CAVERN. THE PUSH THE

01:01:36.859 --> 01:01:38.194
WATER. AND WHEN THE WATER COMES

01:01:38.261 --> 01:01:40.997
DOWN IT FORCES THE- THEY ON

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:43.533
ROCK ON THE TOP TO LIFT UP. AND

01:01:43.599 --> 01:01:44.767
THE ROCK HUNDRED NEEDS TO PRESS

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.669
DOWN. AND THE ENERGY THAT

01:01:46.736 --> 01:01:47.904
SPENDING THAT COMPRESSED ROCK

01:01:47.970 --> 01:01:49.806
YOU'D THINK OF ROCK AS A SPRING

01:01:49.872 --> 01:01:51.541
BUT EFFECTIVELY IT CAN WORK AS

01:01:51.607 --> 01:01:53.409
A SPRING. IN THE CONSTRUED

01:01:53.476 --> 01:01:54.677
STORE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS OF

01:01:54.744 --> 01:01:57.447
ENERGY THERE. THE USE OF HYDRO

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:59.849
POWER OF MOVING WATER TO BE

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.617
ABLE TO TURN A TURBINE IS WELL

01:02:01.684 --> 01:02:02.685
ESTABLISHED FOR HYDRO POWER

01:02:02.752 --> 01:02:04.153
AROUND THE WORLD. THEY'VE GOT

01:02:04.220 --> 01:02:06.122
PROJECTS ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND

01:02:06.189 --> 01:02:07.457
IN CANADA AND AGAIN THIS IS

01:02:07.523 --> 01:02:09.158
VERY SCALABLE. THEY CAN BRING

01:02:09.225 --> 01:02:10.460
IN A DRILL THEY TELL ME THAT

01:02:10.526 --> 01:02:11.894
THEY CONTROL THIS WHOLE IN A

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.130
DATE USING STANDARD OIL. DRILL

01:02:14.197 --> 01:02:16.432
SORTS OF TECHNOLOGY. AND THEN

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.067
THE HYDRO POWER EQUIPMENT IS

01:02:18.134 --> 01:02:20.203
ALSO READILY AVAILABLE- IF

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:22.205
THESE PROJECTS- ARE SUCCESSFUL

01:02:22.271 --> 01:02:24.040
IN DEMONSTRATING THEIR ABILITY

01:02:24.107 --> 01:02:26.008
TO CONTROL OF THIS AGAIN WE CAN

01:02:26.075 --> 01:02:28.244
USE THOSE- COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:29.245
OUT THERE ALREADY WITH

01:02:29.312 --> 01:02:32.782
TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW HOW. TO

01:02:32.849 --> 01:02:33.749
DEPLOY THIS ON A HUGE SCALE. SO

01:02:33.816 --> 01:02:36.586
JUST IN SUMMARY- THE ANSWERS TO

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:37.920
THE QUESTIONS WHAT ROLE THE

01:02:37.987 --> 01:02:39.689
STORAGE PLACE. STORAGE IS

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:40.656
NEEDED TO GET THROUGH THE

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.892
NIGHT- SEASONAL STORAGE IS

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:45.862
PRIMARILY AN INSURANCE POLICY

01:02:45.928 --> 01:02:46.829
SO THEY'RE TWO DIFFERENT. TYPES

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:49.232
OF. MARKET MECHANISMS WE SHOULD

01:02:49.298 --> 01:02:50.566
BE THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH

01:02:50.633 --> 01:02:52.502
STORAGE DO WE NEED- OUR

01:02:52.568 --> 01:02:53.569
ESTIMATES ARE WE GOING TO NEED

01:02:53.636 --> 01:02:55.071
ABOUT A QUARTER OF A TERAWATT

01:02:55.138 --> 01:02:57.140
HOUR FOR DIURNAL STORAGE. THE

01:02:57.206 --> 01:02:59.041
WORST CASE I FIND FOR SEASONAL

01:02:59.108 --> 01:03:00.910
STORAGE COULD BE ABOUT 10% OF

01:03:00.977 --> 01:03:02.578
THE ANNUAL LOAD. I DON'T THINK

01:03:02.645 --> 01:03:04.447
THIS IS LIKELY I THINK THAT IF

01:03:04.514 --> 01:03:06.349
WE BUILD MORE SOLAR SO THAT WE

01:03:06.415 --> 01:03:08.184
CAN MEET THE NEED TO GENERATE.

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:10.553
HYDROGEN THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:11.921
AND IF WE DO IT SMARTLY IT GETS

01:03:11.988 --> 01:03:13.589
COMPLICATED BUT I CAN TELL YOU.

01:03:13.656 --> 01:03:15.224
I THINK WE CAN GET DOWN TO THE

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:16.459
AMOUNT OF SEASONAL STORAGE WE

01:03:16.526 --> 01:03:18.294
NEED WOULD BE LESS THAN 1% OF

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:19.996
THE AND A LOAD- WHAT

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.231
TECHNOLOGIES. I DIDN'T TALK

01:03:22.298 --> 01:03:23.599
ABOUT BATTERIES I DID TALK

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.001
ABOUT SOME OF THE OTHERS FOR

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.135
THE SEASONAL STORAGE WE'RE

01:03:26.202 --> 01:03:27.303
LOOKING AT MORE THE CHEMICAL

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:29.639
STORAGE. AND WE ALSO NEED TO BE

01:03:29.705 --> 01:03:31.607
THINKING ABOUT THAT WE NEED TO

01:03:31.674 --> 01:03:33.743
HAVE THESE TYPES OF THINGS LIKE

01:03:33.809 --> 01:03:35.111
HYDROGEN THAT WILL BE USING FOR

01:03:35.178 --> 01:03:36.846
TRANSPORTATION AND INDUSTRIAL.

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:37.947
SO WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE A

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:39.615
SEPARATE RESERVOIR THAT'S JUST

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:41.350
FOR THE POWER SECTOR. WE CAN

01:03:41.417 --> 01:03:42.852
USE THAT SAME RESERVOIR THEY

01:03:42.919 --> 01:03:43.920
WERE USING TO DRIVE ALL THESE

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:46.055
ENERGY SECTORS TO PROVIDE THE

01:03:46.122 --> 01:03:46.989
SEASONAL STORAGE FOR THE POWER

01:03:47.056 --> 01:03:48.991
SECTOR- AND THEN FINALLY THE

01:03:49.058 --> 01:03:50.726
OTHER SOLUTIONS I THINK THE

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.628
OBVIOUS THING TO DO IS TO USE

01:03:52.695 --> 01:03:54.530
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY SOURCES.

01:03:54.597 --> 01:03:56.432
THAT ARE BUILT OUT AT A LEVEL

01:03:56.499 --> 01:03:58.301
THAT WILL ALSO MEET NOT JUST

01:03:58.367 --> 01:04:00.303
OUR CURRENT- ELECTRICITY LOADS.

01:04:00.369 --> 01:04:02.405
BUT ALSO THE NEW LOADS LIKE

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.240
ELECTROLYSIS AND SOME OF THOSE

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.442
LOADS HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY-

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:07.343
AND SO WE DON'T NEED TO AND

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:09.912
MAYBE. USE THEM AS FREQUENTLY

01:04:09.979 --> 01:04:11.814
BUT WE CAN- COUPLE TOGETHER THE

01:04:11.881 --> 01:04:13.950
RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY WITH THE

01:04:14.016 --> 01:04:15.384
DEMAND MANAGEMENT THESE HUGE

01:04:15.451 --> 01:04:17.853
LOADS CAN GREATLY REDUCE THE

01:04:17.920 --> 01:04:18.854
SIZE OF THE SEASONAL STORAGE WE

01:04:18.921 --> 01:04:21.457
NEED. I'M AND THANK YOU IT'S A

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.826
REAL PLEASURE- TO BE HERE LET

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:24.460
ME SEE IF I CAN FIGURE OUT HOW

01:04:24.527 --> 01:04:29.599
TO. CONSTRUCTION I'M THANK YOU

01:04:29.665 --> 01:04:34.837
AND AGAIN- I- URGE- STUDENTS-

01:04:34.904 --> 01:04:38.741
PEOPLE GOING TO SCHOOL TODAY.

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.476
TO DEFINITELY TALK TO DOCTOR

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:45.081
KURTZ- AN EXTRAORDINARY WOMAN-

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:48.251
AND EXTRAORDINARY- PROJECT. SO

01:04:48.317 --> 01:04:51.787
MISTER BENNETT YOU ARE THE

01:04:51.854 --> 01:04:54.023
FIRST ONE UP TO ASK A QUESTION.

01:04:54.090 --> 01:04:55.191
I HAVE SOME OF MY QUESTIONS

01:04:55.258 --> 01:04:58.060
OVER THERE SO I MAY ASK AGAIN.

01:04:58.127 --> 01:04:59.629
YES GOOD MOVE BACK AND FORTH

01:04:59.695 --> 01:05:01.530
ANYTIME BUT LET ME LET I FIFTY

01:05:01.597 --> 01:05:03.399
EIGHT GET THAT SHE SHE THE

01:05:03.466 --> 01:05:04.767
DOCTOR ANSWERED ONE OF MY

01:05:04.834 --> 01:05:05.668
QUESTIONS WHICH WAS THE WHOLE

01:05:05.735 --> 01:05:06.836
ISSUE OF WHAT'S THE QUANTITY

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:09.105
OF. OF STORAGE NEEDED AND SO

01:05:09.171 --> 01:05:10.406
YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE GIVEN UP

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.375
THE BASIC PARAMETERS LOOKING

01:05:12.441 --> 01:05:14.443
FOR THEIR- A QUESTION I HAVE

01:05:14.510 --> 01:05:15.478
THOUGH ABOUT THE HYDROGEN I'M

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:18.981
INTRIGUED- BY THE IDEA OF.

01:05:19.048 --> 01:05:21.584
PRODUCING HYDROGEN WHEN YOU

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:22.418
HAVE THE EXCESS SOLAR BECAUSE

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:25.388
THEN. IT'S NOT AS COSTLY IN

01:05:25.454 --> 01:05:26.856
THAT SITUATION IS THERE ANY

01:05:26.922 --> 01:05:29.425
PROBLEM WITH LONG TERM STORAGE

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:32.194
OF HYDROGEN. YES STORAGE OF

01:05:32.261 --> 01:05:35.031
HYDROGEN IS A BIG DEAL HOWEVER

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:36.532
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:05:36.599 --> 01:05:39.335
USING UNDERGROUND STORAGE. MUCH

01:05:39.402 --> 01:05:40.803
LIKE WHAT WE'RE USING NATURAL

01:05:40.870 --> 01:05:42.338
GAS UNDERGROUND STORAGE THERE'S

01:05:42.405 --> 01:05:44.240
THE POSSIBILITY OF USING THAT

01:05:44.307 --> 01:05:46.042
SAME TYPE OF LOW COST STORAGE

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.943
THERE AND THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO.

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.645
ESPECIALLY IN UTAH THERE'S A

01:05:49.712 --> 01:05:51.514
BIG PROJECT DOING THAT NOW AS

01:05:51.580 --> 01:05:52.715
LONG AS WE'RE USING OUR

01:05:52.782 --> 01:05:54.483
UNDERGROUND STORAGE FOR NATURAL

01:05:54.550 --> 01:05:55.518
GAS IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT

01:05:55.584 --> 01:05:57.219
BUT EVENTUALLY. WE SHOULD BE

01:05:57.286 --> 01:05:59.221
ABLE TO DEVELOP THE RESOURCES

01:05:59.288 --> 01:06:00.856
WE NEED TO DO THE UNDERGROUND

01:06:00.923 --> 01:06:03.059
STORAGE. SO BE SIDE UNDERGROUND

01:06:03.125 --> 01:06:04.727
STORAGE IS THERE I MEAN DOES

01:06:04.794 --> 01:06:06.495
HYDROGEN SIMPLY HYDROGEN IN A

01:06:06.562 --> 01:06:09.231
TANK OF LAST FOR SIX MONTHS OR-

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:11.033
A YEAR CAN AT LAST THAT LONG OR

01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:12.702
IS THERE SOME LIMITED AMOUNT OF

01:06:12.768 --> 01:06:15.571
TIME HYDROGEN CAN LAST. I

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:16.505
REALLY DON'T KNOW I DON'T HAVE

01:06:16.572 --> 01:06:19.675
AN- BASIC IDEA ON THAT AT ALL.

01:06:19.742 --> 01:06:21.644
SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT YOU

01:06:21.711 --> 01:06:24.146
THINK ABOUT THREE PRIMARY WAYS

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.115
TO STORE HYDROGEN. ONE IS YOU

01:06:26.182 --> 01:06:26.882
CAN STORE IT UNDER HIGH

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.684
PRESSURE. AND IF YOU GO INTO

01:06:28.751 --> 01:06:30.119
THE UNDERGROUND CAVERN YOU WILL

01:06:30.186 --> 01:06:32.788
PUT IT UNDER PRESSURE- YOU CAN

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:34.156
ALSO THEN WHEN YOU TAKE IT OUT

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:35.358
WHEN YOU PUT IT SAY INTO A

01:06:35.424 --> 01:06:36.826
VEHICLE OR TO TRANSPORT IT

01:06:36.892 --> 01:06:38.294
AROUND YOU CAN PUT IT IN A

01:06:38.361 --> 01:06:39.295
CYLINDER WHERE IT'S UNDER HIGH

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.430
PRESSURE. ANOTHER AT THE OTHER

01:06:41.497 --> 01:06:43.499
EXTREME IS TO LIQUEFY IT AND OF

01:06:43.566 --> 01:06:45.201
COURSE AS A CRYOGENIC LIQUID.

01:06:45.267 --> 01:06:47.269
SO IF YOU HAVE A WELL SEALED

01:06:47.336 --> 01:06:49.638
VESSEL THE HIGH PRESSURE CAN

01:06:49.705 --> 01:06:51.273
LAST FOR A LONG TIME THE

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:53.242
LEAKAGE RATES CAN BE QUITE LOW.

01:06:53.309 --> 01:06:54.510
IF YOU HAVE THE CRYOGENIC

01:06:54.577 --> 01:06:56.245
LIQUID IT GETS MORE COMPLICATED

01:06:56.312 --> 01:06:58.714
BECAUSE IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:06:58.781 --> 01:07:02.084
KEEP THE TEMPERATURE LOS. SO

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.120
YOU WILL SEE THAT YOU EITHER

01:07:04.186 --> 01:07:06.422
HAVE TO CONTINUE TO CHILL IT SO

01:07:06.489 --> 01:07:07.390
THAT IT DOESN'T WARM UP AND

01:07:07.456 --> 01:07:10.059
BOIL AWAY. OR YOU WILL HAVE.

01:07:10.126 --> 01:07:11.527
SOME LOSS WITH THE LIQUID

01:07:11.594 --> 01:07:13.763
HYDROGEN. NOW THE THIRD ONE

01:07:13.829 --> 01:07:14.663
THAT'S VERY INTERESTING IS THAT

01:07:14.730 --> 01:07:16.732
THERE IS. THE POSSIBILITY OF

01:07:16.799 --> 01:07:18.634
USING A METAL HYDRIDE OR

01:07:18.701 --> 01:07:19.869
SOMETHING LIKE THAT WHERE YOU

01:07:19.935 --> 01:07:21.871
CAN STORE IT AND EFFECTIVELY

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:23.272
ROOM TEMPERATURE OR JUST A

01:07:23.339 --> 01:07:24.106
LITTLE BIT BELOW ROOM

01:07:24.173 --> 01:07:25.908
TEMPERATURE. AT A SOMEWHAT

01:07:25.975 --> 01:07:27.977
ELEVATED PRESSURE. AND THEN

01:07:28.043 --> 01:07:29.478
WHEN YOU WANT TO BRING IT OUT

01:07:29.545 --> 01:07:31.113
YOU WARM IT UP A LITTLE BIT AND

01:07:31.180 --> 01:07:33.182
THEN- TAKE IT OUT. AT A

01:07:33.249 --> 01:07:34.884
PRESSURE THAT'S CLOSER AND

01:07:34.950 --> 01:07:36.152
THAT'S A MUCH LOWER PRESSURE

01:07:36.218 --> 01:07:36.952
THAN WHAT YOU WOULD USE IN A

01:07:37.019 --> 01:07:39.388
BIG CYLINDER. THAT TECHNOLOGY

01:07:39.455 --> 01:07:41.624
IS NOW BEING COMMERCIALIZED AND

01:07:41.690 --> 01:07:43.159
IT'S AGAIN IN MORE OF A

01:07:43.225 --> 01:07:45.060
DEVELOPMENT STAGE. IT MAY BE

01:07:45.127 --> 01:07:46.262
MORE DIFFICULT TO SCALE BECAUSE

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:47.897
YOU HAVE TO GET A LOT OF- METAL

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:49.665
HYDRIDE MATERIAL BUT IT HAS THE

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.434
POTENTIAL. TO ALSO GIVE YOU

01:07:51.500 --> 01:07:53.002
SOME LOCAL STORAGE WHICH MAKES

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:54.670
IT EASIER IF YOU DON'T HAVE AN

01:07:54.737 --> 01:07:55.604
UNDERGROUND CAVERN CITY

01:07:55.671 --> 01:07:58.441
UNDERGROUND. I'M I'M INTERESTED

01:07:58.507 --> 01:08:02.111
BUT THEN A LITTLE WHILE TO.

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:03.179
BURDEN YOU WHICH I DIDN'T GET

01:08:03.245 --> 01:08:04.547
INTO ALL OF THE REST OF THIS

01:08:04.613 --> 01:08:05.514
RIGHT NOW GIVEN OUR TIME

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:07.049
CONSTRAINTS BUT- I'M INTERESTED

01:08:07.116 --> 01:08:09.718
IN THE IN. TRYING TO SEE HOW

01:08:09.785 --> 01:08:12.188
MUCH VARIETY WE CAN CREATE AND

01:08:12.254 --> 01:08:14.623
STORAGE OPTIONS FOR HYDROGEN-

01:08:14.690 --> 01:08:16.759
IF IT IS GOING TO BE A- AN

01:08:16.826 --> 01:08:18.360
IMPORTANT SOURCE FORCED A MORE

01:08:18.427 --> 01:08:19.695
VARIETY WE HAVE IN TERMS OF

01:08:19.762 --> 01:08:21.497
STORY UP STORAGE OPTIONS.

01:08:21.564 --> 01:08:23.499
OBVIOUSLY THE MORE APPLICABLES

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.568
DALY THE ENERGY SOURCE COULD

01:08:25.634 --> 01:08:27.770
BE. AND COULD BE USED AND COULD

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.071
BE APPLIED GEOGRAPHICALLY

01:08:29.138 --> 01:08:31.006
ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:08:31.073 --> 01:08:33.008
THANK YOU. I'D AND I'D LOOK

01:08:33.075 --> 01:08:34.610
REALLY LIKE TO ADD THEIR I

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:35.744
REALLY INTRIGUING WHEN THERE'S

01:08:35.811 --> 01:08:37.646
SO MANY INNOVATIONS OUT THERE

01:08:37.713 --> 01:08:39.181
ONE IS THAT YOU CAN TAKE AN OLD

01:08:39.248 --> 01:08:42.084
OIL WELL. AND YOU CAN- CAP OFF

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:44.553
THE PART OF THE WELL THAT IS.

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:46.455
INTO THE POOREST ROCK SO THAT

01:08:46.522 --> 01:08:47.590
YOU CAN SEAL IT UP AND THEN YOU

01:08:47.656 --> 01:08:49.325
CAN USE THAT SHAFT THAT'S USED

01:08:49.391 --> 01:08:51.694
IN THE OIL WELL. AS A WAY OF

01:08:51.760 --> 01:08:53.929
STORING THE HYDROGEN. AND SO

01:08:53.996 --> 01:08:55.331
IT'S ACTUALLY SOME OF THE OIL

01:08:55.397 --> 01:08:56.298
COMPANIES ARE INTERESTED IN

01:08:56.365 --> 01:08:58.467
BEING ABLE TO- YOU SAID YOU CAN

01:08:58.534 --> 01:09:00.035
EITHER. USE THEM TO STORE THE

01:09:00.102 --> 01:09:01.303
HYDROGEN OR YOU CAN PUT A BIG

01:09:01.370 --> 01:09:02.204
WEIGHT AND INTO A GRAVITY

01:09:02.271 --> 01:09:06.642
STORAGE AND ACTIVE. IN IT IF

01:09:06.709 --> 01:09:07.276
YOU IF YOU USE IN THE STORE THE

01:09:07.343 --> 01:09:07.843
HYDROGEN. YOU HAVE TO DO IT

01:09:07.910 --> 01:09:09.011
UNDER PRESSURE YOU DON'T HAVE

01:09:09.078 --> 01:09:11.780
TO REFRIGERATE OR YOU HAPPEN

01:09:11.847 --> 01:09:13.916
TO. GREAT IT'S AS LONG AS JUST

01:09:13.983 --> 01:09:14.517
UNDER PRESSURE YOU DON'T HAVE

01:09:14.583 --> 01:09:16.986
TO REFRIGERATE. THAT'S RIGHT

01:09:17.052 --> 01:09:19.822
GREAT THANK YOU OKAY THANK. I

01:09:19.889 --> 01:09:24.426
THANK YOU MISTER BENNETT- OF

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:28.831
THE T. F. MISTER CALDERON. YEAH

01:09:28.898 --> 01:09:33.969
ALL RIGHT ARM. THE SO I HAVE

01:09:34.036 --> 01:09:36.539
SOME- CLARIFICATION SO WHEN YOU

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.541
TALK ABOUT 1% OF THE ANNUAL

01:09:38.607 --> 01:09:40.409
LOAN FIRST OF ALL DURING THE

01:09:40.476 --> 01:09:43.245
WINTER TIME IN CALIFORNIA R.

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:44.613
WELL DURING THE SUMMER OUR

01:09:44.680 --> 01:09:48.918
MAXIMUM POWER AND AGAIN PEOPLE

01:09:48.984 --> 01:09:50.419
GET CONFUSED BETWEEN POWER AND

01:09:50.486 --> 01:09:52.054
ENERGY SO THE AMOUNT OF POWER

01:09:52.121 --> 01:09:55.724
WE GENERATE. AT PEAK IS AROUND

01:09:55.791 --> 01:09:59.061
FIFTY GIGAWATTS. AND JUST KNOW

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:00.396
THAT THE NUMBER IS FIFTY IT'S A

01:10:00.462 --> 01:10:02.665
BIG NUMBER. BOB PROBABLY THE

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.433
AVERAGE FOR THE YEAR IS I DON'T

01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:06.268
KNOW WE'LL WE'LL JUST DO THIS

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:10.439
SAY FORTY. SOMETHING LIKE THAT-

01:10:10.506 --> 01:10:14.476
FORTY GIGAWATTS. AND SO ONE

01:10:14.543 --> 01:10:15.945
WELL YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO

01:10:16.011 --> 01:10:18.147
GENERATE POWER ON THE ORDER OF

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:19.582
TENS OF GIGAWATTS DURING THE

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.050
WINTER MARC MOST LIKELY

01:10:21.116 --> 01:10:23.986
DEPENDING ON. HI THE EXTENT TO

01:10:24.053 --> 01:10:25.521
WHICH YOU MIGHT HAVE GEOTHERMAL

01:10:25.588 --> 01:10:26.388
OR SOMETHING ELSE IT'S BASE

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:28.757
LOAD BUT THE LACK OF SOLAR

01:10:28.824 --> 01:10:29.658
YOU'RE YOU'RE GOING TO DATE ON

01:10:29.725 --> 01:10:32.595
THE ORDER OF TEN OR SO

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:35.064
GIGAWATTS. OF POWER. AND YOU'RE

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:36.231
SAYING THAT THE AMOUNT OF

01:10:36.298 --> 01:10:39.535
STORAGE SO. THE AMOUNT OF

01:10:39.602 --> 01:10:43.305
ENERGY WE USE IS. FORTY

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:46.609
GIGAWATT TIMES THE NUMBER OF

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:51.246
TIMES THE TIME IN A YEAR. 1% IS

01:10:51.313 --> 01:10:54.316
ABOUT THREE DAYS- OF THAT SO

01:10:54.383 --> 01:10:57.152
WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT.

01:10:57.219 --> 01:11:01.657
GENERATING TENS OF GIGAWATTS

01:11:01.724 --> 01:11:05.995
FOR THE EQUIVALENT OF. SO THREE

01:11:06.061 --> 01:11:09.465
DAYS TIMES- FORTY AROUND A

01:11:09.531 --> 01:11:10.766
HUNDRED AND TWENTY GIGAWATT

01:11:10.833 --> 01:11:15.604
HOURS- OF STORAGE THAT'S THAT'S

01:11:15.671 --> 01:11:18.173
A HUGE NUMBER. AND I JUST WANT

01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:20.743
TO SAY HOW BIG THAT IS- YOU

01:11:20.809 --> 01:11:22.511
KNOW ALL THE HYDRO WE HAVE IN

01:11:22.578 --> 01:11:24.680
THE STATE IS YOU KNOW. IF YOU

01:11:24.747 --> 01:11:32.421
GET A LOT- AND IT RUNS. FOR- A

01:11:32.488 --> 01:11:35.157
MONTH OR TWO- LET'S SAY SIXTY

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:38.427
DAYS YOU KNOW. YES THE NUMBERS

01:11:38.494 --> 01:11:40.396
ARE JUST OFF THE SCALE COMPARED

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:41.897
TO ANYTHING ELSE WE DO AND

01:11:41.964 --> 01:11:45.067
YOU'RE ALSO POINTING OUT. THAT

01:11:45.134 --> 01:11:47.569
THE ECONOMICS IS SUCH THAT

01:11:47.636 --> 01:11:49.471
YOU'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE AS

01:11:49.538 --> 01:11:51.940
WITH NATURAL GAS SOME AMOUNT

01:11:52.007 --> 01:11:54.376
THAT'S JUST THERE FOR SECURITY

01:11:54.443 --> 01:11:54.943
THAT YOU PROBABLY NEVER WILL

01:11:55.010 --> 01:11:57.813
YEARS. AND THEN AN AMOUNT.

01:11:57.880 --> 01:11:59.481
WHICH YOU WILL USE WHICH IS

01:11:59.548 --> 01:12:02.384
ALREADY A LARGE NUMBER. AND

01:12:02.451 --> 01:12:04.720
JUST GET PEOPLE USED TO THE

01:12:04.787 --> 01:12:05.921
IDEA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:12:05.988 --> 01:12:07.690
SCALES THAT WE JUST DON'T KNOW

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:11.226
MUCH ABOUT. THE END QUESTION IS

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.895
GOING TO BE WHAT'S THE CHEAPEST

01:12:12.961 --> 01:12:15.330
WAY TO DO THIS. AND THERE ARE

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:17.132
OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT THERE

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:18.333
JUST WASN'T TIME TO GET INTO.

01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:21.470
BUT PART OF THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:12:21.537 --> 01:12:23.906
EFFICIENCY. SO LET'S SAY YOU'RE

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:27.109
STORING HYDROGEN- NOT QUITE BUT

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:29.678
WHEN YOU WHEN YOU ELECTROLYSIS

01:12:29.745 --> 01:12:32.881
EYES WATER INTO HYDROGEN OR

01:12:32.948 --> 01:12:33.482
WHAT'S THE EFFICIENCY OF THAT

01:12:33.549 --> 01:12:37.186
APPROXIMATELY. SO IT CAN VARY

01:12:37.252 --> 01:12:39.221
BUT- YOU MAY HAVE AN EFFICIENCY

01:12:39.288 --> 01:12:41.156
JUST FOR THEIR THE CONVERSION

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:42.958
TO HYDROGEN CAN BE APPROACHING

01:12:43.025 --> 01:12:45.694
SOMETHING LIKE 70% 70% AND THEN

01:12:45.761 --> 01:12:48.664
AT THAT. IF WE CAN GET AND THEN

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:51.100
THE BEST. CONVERTING IT BACK

01:12:51.166 --> 01:12:52.468
INTO ELECTRICITY YOU'RE GOING

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:53.869
TO GET MORE LOSSES PROBABLY

01:12:53.936 --> 01:12:55.771
ANOTHER THAT PASSED ANOTHER 70%

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:58.006
EFFICIENCY YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:12:58.073 --> 01:13:00.943
A LOSS OF ABOUT HALF. OF THE

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:03.078
ENERGY IS GENERATED JUST FOR

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:04.613
AND IT MAY BE THE ROUND TRIP

01:13:04.680 --> 01:13:05.681
EFFICIENCY WILL PROBABLY

01:13:05.748 --> 01:13:07.916
BETWEEN 30% AND 50% FOR THE

01:13:07.983 --> 01:13:11.353
HYDROGEN. AND FOR THE OTHERS-

01:13:11.420 --> 01:13:12.588
THAT YOU MENTIONED TO THE-

01:13:12.654 --> 01:13:15.991
COMPRESSED AIR IS ROUND TRIP

01:13:16.058 --> 01:13:17.493
THE COMPRESSED AIR WILL BE

01:13:17.559 --> 01:13:19.161
LOWER IF THEY MAY BE ABLE TO

01:13:19.228 --> 01:13:21.864
MAKE MORE LIKE 65% THE- THE

01:13:21.930 --> 01:13:23.432
QUICK NAPS APPROACH WITH THE GM

01:13:23.499 --> 01:13:25.467
MECHANICAL MAY BE ABLE TO

01:13:25.534 --> 01:13:28.270
APPROACH. I'M MORE LIKE 75%

01:13:28.337 --> 01:13:30.439
EIGHTY PERCENT. SEVENTY FIVE OR

01:13:30.506 --> 01:13:33.776
80% I NEED TO TRANSFER. ALL

01:13:33.842 --> 01:13:35.244
RIGHT BUT IT'S HIGHER THAN IT

01:13:35.310 --> 01:13:37.980
SHOULD BOTH OF. ENJOYING HIGHER

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:41.083
THAN HYDROGEN ARM. AGAIN GET A

01:13:41.150 --> 01:13:44.119
HOUSE EXPENSIVE IS IT GONNA BE

01:13:44.186 --> 01:13:46.355
TO. OUR STORE ANY OF THESE BUT

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:50.125
OUR- THERE'S A LOT WE NEED TO

01:13:50.192 --> 01:13:51.293
DO WE WERE GOING TO NEED TO

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.828
HAVE THESE PLANTS AND ONE OF

01:13:52.895 --> 01:13:54.797
THE THINGS I WAS VERY IMPRESSED

01:13:54.863 --> 01:13:55.397
WITH IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE

01:13:55.464 --> 01:13:58.767
DOING THIS NOW. AND THAT IS

01:13:58.834 --> 01:14:08.310
GREAT- THERE WILL OF COURSE BE

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:11.246
QUESTIONS ABOUT BY THE WAY NO

01:14:11.313 --> 01:14:12.648
MATTER WHAT WE DO WE WILL NEED

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:13.782
HYDROGEN FOR SOME THINGS

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:15.884
PARTICULARLY INDUSTRIAL AREN'T

01:14:15.951 --> 01:14:19.121
THAT INDUSTRIAL- ELEMENT SO WE

01:14:19.188 --> 01:14:20.455
WILL BE PRODUCING HYDROGEN

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:22.391
WHETHER IT'S USED FOR STORAGE

01:14:22.457 --> 01:14:24.259
OR SOMETHING ELSE- ARE THERE

01:14:24.326 --> 01:14:26.595
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. YES MISTER

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:36.238
BENNETT. GOOD. I WANT TO LOWER

01:14:36.305 --> 01:14:48.717
THE RATE HI THIS. IS. I THEY

01:14:48.784 --> 01:14:50.919
ARE OFTEN LEFT AFTER

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:53.856
TRANSPORTATION. RECITED AS WE

01:14:53.922 --> 01:14:58.126
GET MORE OUT. I'M SORRY I'M A

01:14:58.193 --> 01:14:59.294
START OVER AGAIN BECAUSE YOU

01:14:59.361 --> 01:15:00.629
COULDN'T HEAR I COULD SEE YOU

01:15:00.696 --> 01:15:02.397
LEADING AND I DIDN'T HAVE MY-

01:15:02.464 --> 01:15:04.833
MICROPHONE BECAUSE HYDROGEN HAS

01:15:04.900 --> 01:15:07.002
A LOWER EFFICIENCY RATE. THAN

01:15:07.069 --> 01:15:08.670
THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT YOU

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.706
JUST MENTIONED IT- AT SIXTY

01:15:10.772 --> 01:15:12.608
FIVE AND PROTECT SEVENTY FIVE

01:15:12.674 --> 01:15:14.276
TO POTENTIALLY EIGHTY. WHILE IT

01:15:14.343 --> 01:15:16.144
HAS A LOWER EFFICIENCY RATE IT

01:15:16.211 --> 01:15:18.547
HAS A GREATER APPLICABILITY TO

01:15:18.614 --> 01:15:20.682
TRANSPORTATION AND OTHER ITEMS

01:15:20.749 --> 01:15:22.017
SO WE'RE GOING TO BEG PRODUCING

01:15:22.084 --> 01:15:23.619
THAT ANYWAY. SO I WOULD BE

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:24.753
CURIOUS OF SOME KIND OF

01:15:24.820 --> 01:15:29.725
ANALYSIS OF THE ECONOMIES OF

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.760
OF CREATING THE HYDROGEN. WELL

01:15:31.827 --> 01:15:32.327
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO TO THE

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:33.362
TROUBLE OF TRADING IT FOR OTHER

01:15:33.428 --> 01:15:35.197
THINGS DONE WHAT'S THE MARGINAL

01:15:35.264 --> 01:15:37.032
COST OF CREATING SOME MORE FOR

01:15:37.099 --> 01:15:39.167
STORAGE FOR. OF THE ELECTRIC

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:42.037
GRID VERSES. INVESTING IN A NEW

01:15:42.104 --> 01:15:44.473
TECHNOLOGY OR AYE AYE AYE WHICH

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:45.607
COME FROM THE STANDPOINT OF

01:15:45.674 --> 01:15:46.975
RESILIENCY AND WHAT HAVE SOME

01:15:47.042 --> 01:15:49.344
OF ALL BUT- BUT- THAT WILL THAT

01:15:49.411 --> 01:15:50.812
PART OF THE ANALYSIS WOULD BE

01:15:50.879 --> 01:15:52.447
SOMETHING I'D BE INTERESTED IN.

01:15:52.514 --> 01:15:54.316
DOWN THE ROAD AND I KNOW YOU

01:15:54.383 --> 01:15:55.284
CAN'T GET INTO ALL THAT RIGHT

01:15:55.350 --> 01:15:57.319
NOW BUT- IN MY ACCURATE THAT

01:15:57.386 --> 01:15:57.786
THERE WOULD BE MORE

01:15:57.853 --> 01:15:59.521
APPLICATIONS AT THIS POINT IN

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.956
TIME IT LOOKS LIKE THE HYDROGEN

01:16:01.023 --> 01:16:02.991
AND THE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES.

01:16:03.058 --> 01:16:04.693
STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES. THANK I

01:16:04.760 --> 01:16:06.061
BELIEVE AND THAT'S DEFINITELY

01:16:06.128 --> 01:16:07.663
TRUE AND I'D LIKE TO SHARE WITH

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:09.564
YOU A FUN VISION JUST TO

01:16:09.631 --> 01:16:11.033
STIMULATE YOUR INNOVATION I

01:16:11.099 --> 01:16:12.267
THINK THE FUTURE IS GOING TO BE

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:15.003
VERY DEPENDENT UPON. THE EXTENT

01:16:15.070 --> 01:16:16.071
TO WHICH WE CAN INNOVATE AND

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.506
COME UP WITH DIFFERENT IDEAS.

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:19.608
LET'S SAY THAT WE USE HYDROGEN

01:16:19.675 --> 01:16:22.177
TO- DRIVE ARE BIG TRUCKS THAT

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:24.313
GO ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND

01:16:24.379 --> 01:16:26.114
OTHER TRUCK THEN CAN LOAD UP

01:16:26.181 --> 01:16:27.783
WITH A BIG LOAD OF HYDROGEN

01:16:27.849 --> 01:16:29.651
THEY COULD EVEN POTENTIALLY BE

01:16:29.718 --> 01:16:30.919
A TRUCK THAT CARRIES HYDROGEN

01:16:30.986 --> 01:16:32.854
AROUND IN LARGE QUANTITIES. AND

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.623
THEY HAVE A FUEL CELL ON BOARD

01:16:34.690 --> 01:16:35.991
THAT'S USED TO CONVERT THE

01:16:36.058 --> 01:16:38.493
HYDROGEN. TO ELECTRICITY IN

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:40.696
ORDER TO MAKE THE TRUCK GO. IN

01:16:40.762 --> 01:16:42.130
ADDITION WE HAVE A SITUATION

01:16:42.197 --> 01:16:44.866
LIKE WHAT TEXAS HAD OR LIKE IF

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:47.436
NEXT WEEK WE GOT A HUGE- HEAT

01:16:47.502 --> 01:16:49.571
STORM ACROSS ALL OF THE WESTERN

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:51.106
AND- CALIFORNIA WAS HAVING

01:16:51.173 --> 01:16:52.908
DIFFICULTY. IF YOU'RE A TRUCK

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:55.510
DRIVER YOU MEMBER IN TEXAS THEY

01:16:55.577 --> 01:16:56.044
WERE PAYING NINE THOUSAND

01:16:56.111 --> 01:16:58.146
DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR- WOULD

01:16:58.213 --> 01:16:59.247
YOU BE WILLING TO LOAD YOUR

01:16:59.314 --> 01:17:00.849
TRUCK UP WITH HYDROGEN AND THEN

01:17:00.916 --> 01:17:02.017
DRIVE DOWN THERE AND THEN HOOK

01:17:02.084 --> 01:17:03.452
YOUR FUEL CELL UP TO THE GREAT

01:17:03.518 --> 01:17:04.586
AND USE THE VEHICLE TO GREAT

01:17:04.653 --> 01:17:06.888
KIND OF CONCEPT. I CALL IT A

01:17:06.955 --> 01:17:08.924
TICKER PLANT ON WHEELS. I'M

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.258
MOST OF THE TIME YOU'RE JUST

01:17:10.325 --> 01:17:12.427
USING THAT TRUCK TO. DELIVER

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:14.896
OTHER GOODS. BUT THAT TRUCK NOW

01:17:14.963 --> 01:17:16.565
COULD BE USED TO DRIVE THE

01:17:16.631 --> 01:17:17.466
GREAT IN A PINCH AND IF YOU

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:18.900
PAID SOMEBODY NINE THOUSAND

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.268
DOLLARS A MEGAWATT HOUR THINK

01:17:20.335 --> 01:17:21.003
THEY GO HOOK UP THE TRUCK AND

01:17:21.069 --> 01:17:23.672
TAKE A NAP- WELL THE- RECENT

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:24.706
RESTOCK THE GREAT WITH

01:17:24.773 --> 01:17:26.041

CHARGE UP THE LITHIUM BATTERIES

01:17:27.409 --> 01:17:28.043
AND THINGS THAT ARE SITTING

01:17:28.110 --> 01:17:29.678
THERE. I'M GLAD YOU PUT THAT IS

01:17:29.745 --> 01:17:30.846
THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

01:17:30.912 --> 01:17:32.514
I'VE- BEEN INTRIGUED ABOUT IS

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:34.783

IT'S ALWAYS FUN TO BE HERE BUT

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:35.156

WITH FEDERAL REGULATORS AND

01:21:36.491 --> 01:21:39.561
FEDERAL ENERGY POLICY MATTERS

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:06.755
HAVE HYDROGEN MEMBERS AND MANY

01:22:06.821 --> 01:22:08.523
MEMBERS WHO ARE FOCUSING ON IT

01:22:08.590 --> 01:22:10.458
AND I SHARE THIS SLIDE BECAUSE-

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:11.159
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

01:22:11.226 --> 01:22:13.862
CALIFORNIA'S DOING WELL AT IS.

01:22:13.928 --> 01:22:16.331
CREATING MARKETS AND IS

01:22:16.398 --> 01:22:18.300
DEFINING NEEDS FOR THE ELECTRIC

01:22:18.366 --> 01:22:19.534
SYSTEM AND THEN THE STORAGE

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:20.902
COMPANIES AND THIS IS HOW SEIZE

01:22:20.969 --> 01:22:23.038
OPERATES WE WANT THEM TO

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:24.906

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:27.042
THEM UNDERSTAND. THE CALIFORNIA

01:22:27.108 --> 01:22:28.843
MARKET AND TO THE EXTENT

01:22:28.910 --> 01:22:30.645
APPROPRIATE AS INDUSTRY WE TRY

01:22:30.712 --> 01:22:32.314
TO HAVE A VOICE HERE BUT THEN

01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.548
WE EXPECT THEM TO SHOW UP AND

01:22:33.615 --> 01:22:35.016
COMPETE AND DELIVER GOOD

01:22:35.083 --> 01:22:36.785
COMPETITIVE AND COST EFFECTIVE

01:22:36.851 --> 01:22:39.020
SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIANS. SO

01:22:39.087 --> 01:22:40.121
THESE REALLY ARE THE MEMBERS

01:22:40.188 --> 01:22:41.489
THAT AND IT'S A GREAT PRIVILEGE

01:22:41.556 --> 01:22:43.191
TO WORK AND I WANT TO TELL YOU

01:22:43.258 --> 01:22:44.025
ALL AS MEMBERS OF OUR

01:22:44.092 --> 01:22:47.529
LEGISLATURE HOW IMPORTANT YOUR

01:22:47.595 --> 01:22:48.797
WORK IS BECAUSE- EACH ONE OF

01:22:48.863 --> 01:22:50.198
THESE COMPANIES IS. VERY

01:22:50.265 --> 01:22:52.467
FOCUSED ON CALIFORNIA THEY KNOW

01:22:52.534 --> 01:22:55.036
THAT CALIFORNIA IS A PLACE THAT

01:22:55.103 --> 01:22:57.305
THEY CAN AND SHOULD FOCUS ON

01:22:57.372 --> 01:22:58.907
FOR BUSINESS. AND SO THEY'RE

01:22:58.973 --> 01:23:00.608
TRULY DEPLOYING MILLIONS OF

01:23:00.675 --> 01:23:03.144
DOLLARS. TO GEAR UP IN PROVIDE

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:04.746
SERVICES HERE AND THAT COMES

01:23:04.813 --> 01:23:06.948
FROM YOUR POLICY SIGNALS. SO

01:23:07.015 --> 01:23:09.284
IT'S AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL THAT

01:23:09.351 --> 01:23:09.851

01:23:09.918 --> 01:23:12.654
RESPONDING. I THOUGHT AS I GET

01:23:12.721 --> 01:23:13.922
INTO WHAT THE COMMERCIALIZATION

01:23:13.988 --> 01:23:15.490
CHALLENGES ARE I JUST WANT TO

REMIND EVERYONE I THINK THIS IS

01:23:16.925 --> 01:23:20.028
BEEN CLEAR THAT. THAT THE SCALE

01:23:20.095 --> 01:23:21.663
OF STORAGE NEEDS IN THE SCALE

01:23:21.730 --> 01:23:23.698
OF THIS PROBLEM ARE MASSIVE

01:23:23.765 --> 01:23:26.668
JUST TRULY MASSIVE. AND IN A

01:23:26.735 --> 01:23:29.304
SINGLE DECISION. THIS YEAR THE

01:23:37.679 --> 01:23:39.547
DECISION WAS BIGGER THAN IT

01:23:39.614 --> 01:23:41.116
WASN'T AMOUNT BIGGER THAN MANY

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:43.485
UTILITIES IN THE COUNTRY SO OUR

01:23:43.551 --> 01:23:46.721
SINGLE DECISION FOR- ELEVEN

01:23:46.788 --> 01:23:47.188
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED

01:23:47.255 --> 01:23:48.723
MEGAWATTS. IS BIGGER THAN THE

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:52.160
ENTIRE UTILITY OF LADWP SO THAT

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:54.095
GIVES YOU A SENSE OF THE SCALE.

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:55.296
OF HOW WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING

01:23:55.363 --> 01:23:56.331
STORAGE WE'RE GONNA BE ADDING

01:23:56.398 --> 01:23:58.199
THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF SOLAR

01:23:58.266 --> 01:23:59.501
THOUSANDS OF MEGAWATTS OF

01:23:59.567 --> 01:24:01.536
STORAGE PER YEAR. AND I SHARE

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.138
ALL OF THIS BECAUSE AS WE LOOK

01:24:03.204 --> 01:24:05.240
AT THE COMMERCIALIZATION WHAT I

01:24:05.306 --> 01:24:07.842
THINK THIS- COMMITTEE SHOULD

01:24:07.909 --> 01:24:08.910
FOCUS ON PARTICULAR WITH

01:24:08.977 --> 01:24:11.579
SEASONAL STORAGE IS THAT. WE

01:24:11.646 --> 01:24:15.250
HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM. TAKE YOUR

01:24:15.316 --> 01:24:17.552
OUT FOR AND WE'RE GONNA BE

01:24:17.619 --> 01:24:19.387
SPENDING A LOT OF MONEY ON IT

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:21.156
AS CALIFORNIANS AND I OF COURSE

01:24:21.222 --> 01:24:23.391

01:24:23.458 --> 01:24:24.859
REALLY WANT US TO MAKE SURE THE

01:24:24.926 --> 01:24:26.895
TOOL KIT IS READY AND SO-

01:24:26.961 --> 01:24:30.698
SOMETHING OR PERHAPS SHOULD THE

01:24:30.765 --> 01:24:31.833
CHANCE TO FOCUS ON. COME

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:32.567
DEALING WITH THE VALLEY OF

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.035
DEATH AND REALLY WHAT I WOULD

01:24:34.102 --> 01:24:35.503
SAY IS GETTING THE TOOL KIT

01:24:35.570 --> 01:24:36.538
READY SO THAT WE HAVE ALL OF

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.807
THESE. TECHNOLOGIES READY TO

COMPETE WHICH WILL ULTIMATELY

01:24:40.442 --> 01:24:42.010
BRING COSTS DOWN WHEN IT COMES

01:24:42.076 --> 01:24:42.977
TIME FOR US TO REALLY BE

01:24:43.044 --> 01:24:45.079

01:24:45.146 --> 01:24:47.115
TIMELY MATTER AND WE'RE HAPPY

01:24:47.182 --> 01:24:49.717
TO PARTICIPATE. REALLY FROM THE

01:24:49.784 --> 01:24:50.852
INDUSTRY SIDE I WANT TO TELL

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.954
YOU THOUGH. IT IS TOUGH TO GO

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:55.790
FROM SMALL SCALE ARE INDEED TO-

01:24:55.857 --> 01:24:57.459
BIG SCALE AND WE HAVE MANY OF

01:24:57.525 --> 01:24:58.860
THESE COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:00.428
JOCKEYING TO PROVIDE SERVICES

01:25:00.495 --> 01:25:03.431

BANKS HAVEN'T SEEN THEIR

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:21.649
TECHNOLOGY PERFORM YET. THEY

01:25:21.716 --> 01:25:23.017
DON'T HAVE THE INSURANCE

GENERALLY LAND WITH THIS IS

01:25:53.281 --> 01:25:56.451
THAT. YOU KNOW- MORE SUPPORT IS

01:25:56.518 --> 01:25:58.586
NEEDED- THIS SLIDE HIGHLIGHTS

THAT. AS WE MOVE TOWARDS

01:26:00.588 --> 01:26:02.257
DECARBONISATION THE NEEDS ARE

01:26:02.323 --> 01:26:04.726
JUST SO BIG. THAT WE'RE GONNA

01:26:04.792 --> 01:26:05.860
HAVE TO TAKE IT REALLY

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.629
SERIOUSLY AND SEE SAYS EVEN

01:26:07.695 --> 01:26:09.764
STUDY THE CASE THAT DOCTOR KIRK

01:26:09.831 --> 01:26:12.534
MENTIONED ABOUT- LOW SOLAR

01:26:13.735 --> 01:26:16.137
WINTERTIME AND YOU HEARD- MR

01:26:16.204 --> 01:26:17.906
MURDOCH FROM K. SO EMPHASIZE

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:20.241
THE NEED FOR WINTER. CAPABILITY

DURATION AND SEASONAL STORAGE.

01:26:29.117 --> 01:26:30.084
AND WHEN YOU LOOK AT

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.386

COMMERCIAL SCALE PROJECTS. AND

01:26:59.981 --> 01:27:02.584
THAT OFTEN MEANS- HELPING THEM

ENERGY STORAGE SECTOR- AND

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:23.377
REALLY CAME TOGETHER TO SOLVE-

01:31:23.444 --> 01:31:24.712
ONE CORE PROBLEM IS YOU KNOW

01:31:24.779 --> 01:31:25.379
HOW DO WE COMMERCIALIZE

01:31:25.446 --> 01:31:26.314
TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPED AND

01:31:26.380 --> 01:31:27.715
COMMERCIALIZED TECHNOLOGY THAT

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:29.817
ENABLES A FULLY ELECTRIC. ARE

01:31:29.884 --> 01:31:36.824
FULLY RENEWABLE ELECTRIC CREDIT.

01:31:36.891 --> 01:31:38.926
EXTENDED WEATHER EVENTS THESE

01:31:38.993 --> 01:31:39.727
KIND OF EVENTS THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:31:39.794 --> 01:31:42.163
TALKING ABOUT- THROUGHOUT THIS

01:31:42.230 --> 01:31:44.532
THIS- SESSION. OUR FIRST

01:31:44.599 --> 01:31:46.133
PRODUCT OUR FIRST COMMERCIAL

01:31:46.200 --> 01:31:47.668
PRODUCT IS A RICH CHARGEABLE

01:31:47.735 --> 01:31:49.704
IRON AIR BATTERY. THAT IS

01:31:49.770 --> 01:31:51.205
CAPABLE OF CONTINUOUSLY

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:53.140
DISCHARGING ELECTRICITY FOR ONE

01:31:53.207 --> 01:31:54.175
HUNDRED HOURS THAT'S A LITTLE

01:31:54.242 --> 01:31:56.811
OVER FOUR DAYS. AT SYSTEM COST

01:31:56.878 --> 01:31:58.980
COMPETITIVE WITH FOSSIL FUELED

01:31:59.046 --> 01:32:01.549
POWER PLANTS. BY USING IRON

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:02.416
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MOST

01:32:02.483 --> 01:32:04.352
ABUNDANT AND REALLY CHEAPEST

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:06.587
MINERALS ON THE PLANET. OUR

01:32:06.654 --> 01:32:08.422
SOLUTION WE THINK CAN HELP

01:32:08.489 --> 01:32:10.858
ENABLE- COST EFFECTIVE A 100%

01:32:10.925 --> 01:32:12.660
RENEWABLE ENERGY GRID. OUR

01:32:12.727 --> 01:32:13.961
TECHNOLOGY AGAIN OUR IRON AIR

01:32:14.028 --> 01:32:15.730
BATTERIES A STATIC BATTERY

01:32:15.796 --> 01:32:17.632
THAT'S NOT A FLOW BATTERY. I IT

01:32:17.698 --> 01:32:18.633
DOESN'T INVOLVE KIND OF THE

01:32:18.699 --> 01:32:21.636
PUMPING OF- OF. OPERATOR ERROR

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:22.904
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT LIKE SOME

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.438
OF THE OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR

01:32:24.505 --> 01:32:27.575
PANELISTS DISCUSSED- IN IN IN

01:32:27.642 --> 01:32:28.843
YOUR BEING A BATTERY IS VERY

01:32:28.910 --> 01:32:30.211
MODULAR SO YOU NOW WE DON'T

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:31.979
RELY ON SPECIFIC GEOLOGIC

01:32:32.046 --> 01:32:33.748
FORMATIONS THAT MIGHT LIMIT-

01:32:33.814 --> 01:32:35.316
WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY LOCATE

01:32:35.383 --> 01:32:36.784
THIS THING WE CAN WE CAN LOCATE

01:32:36.851 --> 01:32:38.953
OUR BATTERY- ANYWHERE. AND BY

01:32:39.020 --> 01:32:40.788
NATURE OF USING IRON AND OTHER

01:32:40.855 --> 01:32:43.891
KIND OF- NON HAZARDOUS- ACHE WE

01:32:43.958 --> 01:32:45.159
S. ELECTROLYTES AND OTHER

01:32:45.226 --> 01:32:47.261
MATERIALS. IT'S VERY SAFE WE

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:48.863
DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF

01:32:48.930 --> 01:32:50.264
THERMAL RUNAWAY PROBLEMS THAT

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.233
WITHIN MY OWN- TECHNOLOGIES HAS

01:32:52.300 --> 01:32:54.235
OUR OUR BATTERIES CAN'T

01:32:54.302 --> 01:32:55.002
SPONTANEOUSLY COMBUST OR

01:32:55.069 --> 01:32:57.638
ANYTHING LIKE THAT- AND AGAIN

01:32:57.705 --> 01:32:58.039
IT'S VERY KIND OF-

01:32:58.105 --> 01:33:03.144
GEOGRAPHICALLY. SCALABLE AND

01:33:03.210 --> 01:33:05.079
MODULAR IN THAT SENSE- AND I

01:33:05.146 --> 01:33:06.380
GUESS JUST TO KIND OF

01:33:06.447 --> 01:33:08.549
UNDERSCORE WHY WE THINK. THAT

01:33:08.616 --> 01:33:09.183
THIS IS AN INTERESTING

01:33:09.250 --> 01:33:10.751
APPROACHES. IRON IS THE

01:33:10.818 --> 01:33:12.086
FUNDAMENTAL KIND OF STORAGE

01:33:12.153 --> 01:33:14.555
MEDIA FOR OUR TECHNOLOGY- AND

01:33:14.622 --> 01:33:16.057
IRON BEING ONE OF THE CHEAPEST

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:17.158
AND MOST ABUNDANT MATERIALS ON

01:33:17.224 --> 01:33:18.793
THE PLANET- PRODUCED YOU KNOW

01:33:18.859 --> 01:33:19.794
IN THE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:21.762
TONS- GLOBALLY EACH YEAR ENOUGH

01:33:21.829 --> 01:33:24.598
TO. PROVIDE HUNDREDS OF

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.334
GIGAWATTS OF OUR BATTERIES

01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:29.870
EVERY YEAR AND- IT THE COST OF

01:33:29.937 --> 01:33:31.405
STORING ENERGY IN THE IRON

01:33:31.472 --> 01:33:34.175
MATERIALS IS VERY VERY WELL- TO

01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.009
GIVE YOU A SENSE OF KIND OF

01:33:35.076 --> 01:33:37.011
WHAT WE'RE TARGETING. WE EXPECT

01:33:37.078 --> 01:33:37.778
OUR BATTERIES TO BE ABLE TO

01:33:37.845 --> 01:33:39.547
STORE ENERGY AT LESS THAN ONE

01:33:39.613 --> 01:33:41.248
TENTH UP SOME SURPRISING

01:33:41.315 --> 01:33:42.450
APPROACHING ONE HUNDRED THE

01:33:42.516 --> 01:33:43.617
COST OF TODAY'S LITHIUM ION

01:33:43.684 --> 01:33:46.020
BATTERIES. SO YOU KNOW TO IT TO

01:33:46.087 --> 01:33:47.355
ASSEMBLY MEMBER QUIRKS COMMENTS

01:33:47.421 --> 01:33:49.256
EARLIER THIS REALLY IS KIND OF

01:33:49.323 --> 01:33:51.092
ORDERS OF MAGNITUDE DIFFERENT.

01:33:51.158 --> 01:33:53.427
THAN WHAT WE'RE SEEING TODAY-

01:33:53.494 --> 01:33:54.829
GIVEN THAT IRAN AIR IS NOT

01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:56.130
SOMETHING THAT THIS THIS GROUP

01:33:56.197 --> 01:33:58.065
IS PROBABLY DOT WITH BEFORE. I

01:33:58.132 --> 01:33:59.233
JUST THAT THE TINY INTRODUCTION

01:33:59.300 --> 01:34:01.502
ON THAT- ARE ARE BETTER YOU CAN

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:02.403
REALLY THINK OF IT AS IT IS A

01:34:02.470 --> 01:34:04.405
REVERSIBLE RUST BATTERY SO ON

01:34:04.472 --> 01:34:06.073
DISCHARGING OR WHEN WE'RE-

01:34:06.140 --> 01:34:07.441
SENDING ELECTRICITY TO THE

01:34:07.508 --> 01:34:09.910
GRID. IRON REACTS WITH OXYGEN

01:34:09.977 --> 01:34:11.445
AND CREATES FROST GENERATES

01:34:11.512 --> 01:34:13.381
ELECTRICITY. WHEN ARE CHARGING

01:34:13.447 --> 01:34:15.216
THE BATTERY YEAH I RETURNS TO

01:34:15.282 --> 01:34:17.385
ITS METALLIC STATE AND LEASES

01:34:17.451 --> 01:34:23.157
OXYGEN SO THE ONLY KIND. OF

01:34:23.224 --> 01:34:23.824
PRODUCT OF THAT REACTIVE OXYGEN-

01:34:23.891 --> 01:34:24.892
WE DO SEE OURSELVES THE RIVER.

01:34:24.959 --> 01:34:26.160
FOR WITHIN MY- RATHER WE SEE

01:34:26.227 --> 01:34:26.894
OURSELVES A COMPLIMENT TO

01:34:26.961 --> 01:34:29.330
LITHIUM ION- WE KIND OF LIKE TO

01:34:29.397 --> 01:34:30.898
THINK OF OURSELVES AS WE KNOW

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:31.832
WHEN PAIRING WITH RENEWABLE

01:34:31.899 --> 01:34:34.335
ENERGY. RENEWABLE ENERGY PLUS

01:34:34.402 --> 01:34:35.436
OUR MULTI DAY STORAGE

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:37.605
TECHNOLOGY CAN ENABLE KIND OF

01:34:37.671 --> 01:34:39.306
BASELOAD. RENEWABLES AND

01:34:39.373 --> 01:34:40.775
LITHIUM ION IS REALLY USEFUL AS

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:42.476
KIND OF A PEAKER BACKING ABOUT-

01:34:42.543 --> 01:34:44.512
KIND OF REPLACING. SOME OF

01:34:44.578 --> 01:34:46.447
TODAY'S REALLY. QUICK ACTING

01:34:46.514 --> 01:34:49.316
BUT SHORT RUNNING- NATURAL GAS

01:34:49.383 --> 01:34:51.619
PLANTS. WHERE WE ARE IN OUR

01:34:51.685 --> 01:34:53.020
COMMERCIALIZATION PHASES WERE

01:34:53.087 --> 01:34:54.989
IN THE PROTOTYPING PHASE. SINCE

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:56.457
WE BOUGHT OUR FIRST GET A SELL

ON TEST IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE

01:34:58.426 --> 01:35:00.628
HAVE SCALED OURSELVES ALMOST

01:35:00.694 --> 01:35:01.495
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TIMES SO WE

01:35:01.562 --> 01:35:03.097
ARE EIGHTEEN THOUSAND TIMES

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:06.033
LARGER THAN WE WERE- IN TWENTY

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:06.700
EIGHTEEN AND WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:35:06.767 --> 01:35:10.037
BUILT NOW THE WORLD'S LARGEST-

THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. AND

01:35:41.735 --> 01:35:42.303
THAT'S YOU KNOW NOT BY

01:35:42.369 --> 01:35:45.106
SURPRISES- ALEX JUST MOMENTS

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:46.974
AGO MENTIONED- YOU KNOW WE ARE

01:35:47.041 --> 01:35:48.209
CHOOSING TO SCALE IN THE STATE

01:35:48.275 --> 01:35:50.678
OF CALIFORNIA. BECAUSE REALLY

01:35:50.744 --> 01:35:51.479
THE SUPPORTIVE POLICY

01:35:51.545 --> 01:35:53.314

01:36:05.192 --> 01:36:07.328
FORM. YOU KNOW. I THINK I'M

01:36:07.394 --> 01:36:08.796
GONNA TOUCH BRIEFLY ON THE

01:36:08.863 --> 01:36:09.430
PROBLEM THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:12.299
SOLVE- YOU KNOW ADDS ASSEMBLY

01:36:12.366 --> 01:36:13.601
MEMBER BURKE MENTIONED EARLIER

01:36:13.667 --> 01:36:14.301
TODAY'S BATTERY TECHNOLOGY

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:16.637
LITHIUM ION. I HAVE REALLY KIND

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:18.105
OF SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.874
BALANCING INTRADAY OF RENEWABLE

01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:21.542
ENERGY VERY ABILITY SO WE ARE

01:36:21.609 --> 01:36:22.943
REALLY GOOD TODAY AT MOVING

01:36:23.010 --> 01:36:24.612
ENERGY FROM NOON WE HAVE A LOT

01:36:24.678 --> 01:36:26.313
OF SOLAR POWER. INTO MAYBE THE

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:28.949
EVENING PEAK HOURS- WHEN THIS

01:36:29.016 --> 01:36:30.251
YOU KNOW THE SUN IS STARTING TO

01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:31.218
SET THE DEMAND IS STILL REALLY

01:36:31.285 --> 01:36:32.987
HIGH PEOPLE ARE ARE FLIPPING ON

01:36:33.053 --> 01:36:35.856
YOUR TELEVISION CETERA. HOWEVER

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:36.991
IN THE FUTURE. WELL I BELIEVE

01:36:37.057 --> 01:36:38.492
CHALLENGES WILL NOT BE DRIVEN

01:36:38.559 --> 01:36:41.128
BY THESE PIZZA MAN HOURS RATHER

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:42.496
RELIABILITY CHALLENGES IN THE

01:36:42.563 --> 01:36:45.432
FUTURE WE REALLY BE DRIVEN- BY

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:46.934
KIND OF CONTINUOUS MULTI DAY

01:36:47.001 --> 01:36:48.702
PERIODS OF LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:36:48.769 --> 01:36:50.871
GENERATION. I JUST THAT THAT

01:36:50.938 --> 01:36:52.573
KIND OF. SAY THAT THIS IS NOT

01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:55.109
JUST MY OPINION- THAT THE

01:36:55.176 --> 01:36:57.611
CONSULTANCY E. THREE. WHICH IS-

01:36:57.678 --> 01:36:58.679
CONSULTANCY BASED IN IN

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:00.447
CALIFORNIA- THAT DOES A LOT OF

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:01.448
WORK WITH THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

01:37:01.515 --> 01:37:03.117
UTILITIES COMMISSION TO RUN ITS

01:37:03.184 --> 01:37:04.318
INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLANNING

01:37:04.385 --> 01:37:05.686
PROCESS USE OF THE PROCESSES

01:37:05.753 --> 01:37:07.388
THAT WE USE TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT

01:37:07.454 --> 01:37:08.522
RESOURCES ARE NEEDED ON THE

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:11.225
GROUND- SAID IN A PAPER.

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:12.259
FOCUSING ON ON DEEP

01:37:12.326 --> 01:37:13.394
DECARBONIZATION CALIFORNIA

01:37:13.460 --> 01:37:17.765
THAT. AND I QUOTE. IN A SYSTEM

01:37:17.831 --> 01:37:18.232
WHERE MOST GENERATIONS

01:37:18.299 --> 01:37:19.733
INTERMITTENT. LOSS OF LOAD

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.202
EVENTS DON'T NECESSARILY

01:37:21.268 --> 01:37:22.903
OCCURRED DURING HIGH LOAD

01:37:22.970 --> 01:37:25.105
CONDITIONS RATHER. THE BIGGEST

01:37:25.172 --> 01:37:27.208
DRIVER IS THE POTENTIAL FOR

01:37:27.274 --> 01:37:28.842
MULTI DAY PERIODS OF LOW

01:37:28.909 --> 01:37:30.711
RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION.

01:37:30.778 --> 01:37:32.246
DURING THESE EVENTS RENEWABLE

01:37:32.313 --> 01:37:33.847
GENERATION MAY BE INSUFFICIENT

01:37:33.914 --> 01:37:35.983
TO SERVE ALL LOAD AND STORAGE

01:37:36.050 --> 01:37:38.552
QUICKLY DEPLETES. SO THIS MULTI

01:37:38.619 --> 01:37:41.589
DAY RENEWABLE ENERGY WALL IS D.

01:37:41.655 --> 01:37:43.824
KEOGH ALL ARE THE KEY PROBLEM.

01:37:43.891 --> 01:37:45.693
THAT WE ARE TRYING TO SOLVE.

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:47.795
AND WE'VE DONE OUR OWN ANALYSIS

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:49.663
ON THIS ISSUE WE EXAMINED

01:37:49.730 --> 01:37:51.765
MEETING FOR MANAGING EXAMINED

01:37:51.832 --> 01:37:52.766
THIRTY FIVE YEARS OF RENEWABLE

01:37:52.833 --> 01:37:54.235
ENERGY DATA. THAT WAS PROVIDED

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.169
BY THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC

01:37:55.236 --> 01:37:56.870
UTILITIES COMMISSION THROUGH

01:37:56.937 --> 01:37:57.371
THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE

01:37:57.438 --> 01:37:59.573
PLANNING PROCESS- AND WE LOOKED

01:37:59.640 --> 01:38:00.608
AT YOU KNOW WHAT DOES THE

01:38:00.674 --> 01:38:02.176
CALIFORNIA ENERGY MIX WORK LIKE

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:04.778
IN TWENTY THIRTY. USING THIRTY

01:38:04.845 --> 01:38:07.014
FIVE YEARS OF DATA WE FOUND

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:09.283
THAT. FIFTY OUR RENEWABLE

01:38:09.350 --> 01:38:11.685
ENERGY LEVELS OCCUR EVERY OTHER

01:38:11.752 --> 01:38:13.687
YEAR SO MANY EVERY OTHER YEAR

01:38:13.754 --> 01:38:15.322
ON AVERAGE YOU'RE EXPERIENCING

01:38:15.389 --> 01:38:17.958
A FIFTY OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:38:18.025 --> 01:38:20.027
SHORTFALL. AND ONE HUNDRED OUR

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:21.895
BALLS OCCUR ABOUT ONCE EVERY

01:38:21.962 --> 01:38:24.064
TEN YEARS. AT THE LONGEST WELL

01:38:24.131 --> 01:38:26.133
THAT WE FOUND IN THIS PERIOD

01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:27.468
WAS ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:29.136
HOURS. ACTUALLY WHEN WE THINK

01:38:29.203 --> 01:38:30.437
ABOUT THE RELIABILITY CHALLENGE

01:38:30.504 --> 01:38:31.905
THAT OF THE FUTURE AND THE

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:32.906
CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:34.642
SOLVE. IT'S NOT REALLY A

01:38:34.708 --> 01:38:35.809
SEASONAL CHALLENGES ABOUT BEING

01:38:35.876 --> 01:38:38.912
ABLE TO RELIABLY PROVIDE POWER

01:38:38.979 --> 01:38:40.447
DURING THESE MULTI DAY PERIODS

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:41.649
OF LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:43.150
PRODUCTION. I THINK THIS

01:38:43.217 --> 01:38:44.318
ANALYSIS IS IMPORTANT TO

01:38:44.385 --> 01:38:46.186
UNDERSCORE THAT THIS IS NOT A

01:38:46.253 --> 01:38:47.721
TWENTY FIFTY PROBLEM. THIS IS A

01:38:47.788 --> 01:38:48.255
PROBLEM THAT WE FOUND IN

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:49.790
LOOKING AT THE TWENTY THIRTY

01:38:49.857 --> 01:38:51.025
CALIFORNIA ENERGY NEXUS IS

01:38:51.091 --> 01:38:55.829
REALLY ONE PLANNING. CYCLE AWAY-

01:38:55.896 --> 01:38:56.430
SO THIS IS OF A PROBLEM THAT

01:38:56.497 --> 01:38:58.332
WE'RE GOING AFTER I AND

01:38:58.399 --> 01:39:00.100
UNFORTUNATELY IT IS NOT SO EASY

01:39:00.167 --> 01:39:01.235
TO JUST SAY THIS IS THE

01:39:01.302 --> 01:39:02.269
TECHNOLOGY THAT WE WANT TO

01:39:02.336 --> 01:39:03.604
COMMERCIALIZE AND THEREFORE ALL

01:39:03.671 --> 01:39:05.205
IS GOOD RIGHT THAT THAT'S THE

01:39:05.272 --> 01:39:07.474
REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY- OF

01:39:07.541 --> 01:39:09.243
COURSE- COMMERCIALIZING AND

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:11.278
NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY IS HARD. I'M

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:13.147
THAT THE POWER SECTOR IS REALLY

01:39:13.213 --> 01:39:15.115
CHARACTERIZED BY. MARION

01:39:15.182 --> 01:39:16.717
CHANGED IN SOME CASES CENTURY

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:18.886
OLD THAT INCUMBENTS. AND THE

01:39:18.952 --> 01:39:20.721
COST OF ELECTRICITY IS REALLY

01:39:20.788 --> 01:39:22.189
WHAT THE POWER SECTOR HAS BEEN

01:39:22.256 --> 01:39:23.457
MORE COST AND RELIABILITY

01:39:23.524 --> 01:39:24.525
REALLY HAVE BEEN THE THINGS OF

01:39:24.591 --> 01:39:26.026
THE POWER SECTOR HAS BEEN. I

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:27.094
KIND OF LASER FOCUS ON

01:39:27.161 --> 01:39:29.496
OPTIMIZING FOR- FOR A HUNDRED

01:39:29.563 --> 01:39:30.864
YEARS AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:39:30.931 --> 01:39:31.932
REMEMBER THAT AS A RESULT OF

01:39:31.999 --> 01:39:33.434
THAT THE COST OF ELECTRICITY

01:39:33.500 --> 01:39:35.336
TODAY IS ABOUT ONE TWO HUNDRED.

01:39:35.402 --> 01:39:36.603
ABOUT WHAT OF WHAT IT WAS ABOUT

01:39:36.670 --> 01:39:38.472
A HUNDRED YEARS AGO. ASK THE

01:39:38.539 --> 01:39:39.807
INDUSTRY IS REALLY USED TO KIND

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.809
OF. OPTIMIZING FOR SHORT RUN

01:39:41.875 --> 01:39:44.478
COSTS- ABSENT ANY KIND OF

01:39:44.545 --> 01:39:46.447
POLICY INTERVENTION IT DOESN'T

01:39:46.513 --> 01:39:48.115
USUALLY DISTINGUISH BETWEEN-

01:39:48.182 --> 01:39:49.850
THE ATTRIBUTES OF ELECTRICITY

01:39:49.917 --> 01:39:51.318
AND THERE THERE ISN'T REALLY A

01:39:51.385 --> 01:39:53.187
HISTORY OF PAYING A PREMIUM FOR

01:39:53.253 --> 01:39:54.588
GREEN TECHNOLOGIES ARE FOR

01:39:54.655 --> 01:39:55.756
INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES IS

01:39:55.823 --> 01:39:57.424
REALLY. LASER FOCUSED ON

01:39:57.491 --> 01:39:59.893
MINIMIZING SHORT RUN COSTS. AND

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.528
THAT THE OTHER MAN THE OTHER

01:40:01.595 --> 01:40:02.730
PART THAT I MENTION IT'S REALLY

01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:04.565
LASER FOCUSED ON RELIABILITY. I

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:05.833
YOU KNOW SENT ELECTRICITY IS

01:40:05.899 --> 01:40:06.734
VERY CENTRAL TO OUR MODERN

01:40:06.800 --> 01:40:09.470
LIVES- AND IN ORDER TO OPERATE

01:40:09.536 --> 01:40:10.671
THE GEAT RELIABLY ME AFTER

01:40:10.738 --> 01:40:11.672
THESE BALANCING SUPPLY AND

01:40:11.739 --> 01:40:13.640
DEMAND AT ALL IMES- AND

01:40:13.707 --> 01:40:15.743
BECAUSE OF THAT DYNAMIC WE HAVE

01:40:15.809 --> 01:40:17.911
BY TYPICALLY VERY RISK AVERSE-

01:40:17.978 --> 01:40:19.480
ENTITIES SO INTO. YOU KNOW

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:20.547
BASICALLY COMPANIES THAT OUR

01:40:20.614 --> 01:40:22.883
SUPPLIER POWER DON'T WANT TO

01:40:22.950 --> 01:40:23.751
EXPERIMENT WITH THAT PROBLEM

01:40:23.817 --> 01:40:25.686
SO. THAT WE HAVE THESE KIND OF

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:28.322
TWO PROBLEMS WE HAVE-

01:40:28.389 --> 01:40:29.656
OPTIMIZING FOR REALLY SHORT RUN

01:40:29.723 --> 01:40:31.658
COSTS ABOVE ALL ELSE AND

01:40:31.725 --> 01:40:33.260
OPTIMIZING FOR RELIABILITY

01:40:33.327 --> 01:40:35.095
ABOVE ALL ELSE- AND THIS IS A

01:40:35.162 --> 01:40:36.463
BIG CHALLENGE WHEN YOU HAVE NEW

01:40:36.530 --> 01:40:37.931
TECHNOLOGIES THAT OFTEN START

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:39.366
OUT AS- MORE EXPENSIVE THAN

01:40:39.433 --> 01:40:40.667
THEIR INCUMBENTS. WITH OF

01:40:40.734 --> 01:40:42.169
COURSE A PATHWAY TO BEING MUCH

01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.604
CHEAPER BUT WHEN THE COMPANIES

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:44.872
ARE JUST GETTING LAUNCHED-

01:40:44.938 --> 01:40:45.973
BECAUSE OF ALL THE REASONS THAT

01:40:46.039 --> 01:40:47.474
ALEX AND OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED.

01:40:47.541 --> 01:40:49.209
THEY MIGHT BE MORE EXPENSIVE.

01:40:49.276 --> 01:40:51.245
AND ARE PERCEIVED NEW RISKS

01:40:51.311 --> 01:40:56.750
RIGHT. AND IT'S THEIR PERCEIVED

01:40:56.817 --> 01:40:58.218
ARRESTS WITH EAST ECOLOGY'S.

01:40:58.285 --> 01:40:59.086
AND SO AGAINST THAT BACK

01:40:59.153 --> 01:41:00.020
COMPANIES LIKE FOR ME G. HAVE

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:01.555
TO SCALE TO A POINT OF REALLY

01:41:01.622 --> 01:41:03.857
HAVING HUNDREDS OF MEGAWATTS OF

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:06.393
CAPACITY ON THE GRID SO THEY

01:41:06.460 --> 01:41:09.530
CAN BOTH BRING COSTS DOWN- AND

01:41:09.596 --> 01:41:11.398
CONVINCE ALL OF THE FINANCIERS

01:41:11.465 --> 01:41:13.467
AND OTHER ENTITIES THAT THESE

01:41:13.534 --> 01:41:14.034
ARE REALLY LOW RISK

01:41:14.101 --> 01:41:16.637
TECHNOLOGIES- I'M IN IN ORDER

01:41:16.703 --> 01:41:18.539
TO DO THAT WE'RE GONNA BRING IT

01:41:18.605 --> 01:41:21.975
CAN YOU JUST SHUT UP AND WILL

01:41:22.042 --> 01:41:22.509
TRY AND GET TO THE OTHERS

01:41:22.576 --> 01:41:26.046
SPEAKERS. SO OKAY. AGUIAR-CURRY

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:28.415
OKAY GO AHEAD YEAH SO WHAT LONG

01:41:28.482 --> 01:41:29.783
STORY SHORT TO GET THE STATE OF

01:41:29.850 --> 01:41:31.952
CALIFORNIA HAS A HISTORY OF

01:41:32.019 --> 01:41:34.054
SUPPORTING AT TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:41:34.121 --> 01:41:36.323
INNOVATION- THIS IS DONE WITH

01:41:36.390 --> 01:41:37.991
WHAT THE MRI ON PROVIDING LONG

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:39.793
TERM INVESTMENT SIGNALS THAT

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.161
REALLY I KIND OF FOCUS ON THE

01:41:41.228 --> 01:41:42.463
DIFFERENT STAGES OF TECHNOLOGY

01:41:42.529 --> 01:41:44.231
COMMERCIALIZATION SUPPORTING

01:41:44.298 --> 01:41:46.467
DEMONSTRATION AT THE EARLIER

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:46.900
STAGES OF TECHNOLOGY

01:41:46.967 --> 01:41:48.669
COMMERCIALIZATION. THAT HAS

01:41:48.735 --> 01:41:50.070
REALLY LED TO THE SIGNIFICANT

01:41:50.137 --> 01:41:51.171
BENEFITS IN THE STATE OF

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:52.906
CALIFORNIA AYE THERE'S A REASON

01:41:52.973 --> 01:41:53.974
THAT WE ARE HERE IN THE STATE

01:41:54.041 --> 01:41:55.442
OF CALIFORNIA I AND THERE'S A

01:41:55.509 --> 01:41:56.910
REASON THAT THAT THE INDUSTRY

01:41:56.977 --> 01:41:58.879
IS VERY ROBUST THERE- THIS IS

01:41:58.946 --> 01:42:00.214
ALSO A PROBLEM THIS MONTH THAT

01:42:00.280 --> 01:42:02.082
A PROBLEM IS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:42:02.149 --> 01:42:03.283
THAT YOU THREE AND OTHERS I

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:04.518
FOUND THIS IS NOT GOING TO BE

01:42:04.585 --> 01:42:06.186
AN ISSUE JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT

01:42:06.253 --> 01:42:07.221
ALSO IN THE ACIFIC NORTHWEST

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:08.722
IN THE MIDWEST NORTHEAST UP

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:09.690
STATIC CALIFORNIA REALLY HAVE

01:42:09.756 --> 01:42:11.458
AN OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD HERE

01:42:11.525 --> 01:42:12.659
DEMONSTRATE A PATHWAY FOR

01:42:12.726 --> 01:42:13.861
SOLVING THIS PROBLEM AND ABOUT

01:42:13.927 --> 01:42:15.829
THE INDUSTRY- THAT CAN KIND OF

01:42:15.896 --> 01:42:17.397
GROW IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN BE

01:42:17.464 --> 01:42:19.933
EXPORTED TO- REALLY. PEOPLE

01:42:20.000 --> 01:42:22.503
ELSEWHERE OKAY SO ARE AT THE

01:42:22.569 --> 01:42:23.737
END OF THIS PANEL I'LL BE

01:42:23.804 --> 01:42:27.241
ASKING- WHAT POLICIES MIGHT

01:42:27.307 --> 01:42:30.010
HELP YOU ARE TO GET YOUR

01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:32.312
VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING WHICH I

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:35.048
SUSPECT YOU'RE GETTING- I'M

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:39.553
ALSO JUST JUST FOR THE MOMENT.

01:42:39.620 --> 01:42:41.021
WHILE YOU'RE HERE. I SHOW YOUR-

01:42:41.088 --> 01:42:44.191
RUSHED BASED BATTERY- FIRST ALL

01:42:44.258 --> 01:42:45.659
FOR PEOPLE IN THE AUDIENCE THE

01:42:45.726 --> 01:42:46.493
REASON WHY WE WENT WITH LITHIUM

01:42:46.560 --> 01:42:50.664
AIR IS EXCUSE ME LET THE M. ION

01:42:50.731 --> 01:42:52.766
IS THAT IT IS LIGHTWEIGHT. THE

01:42:52.833 --> 01:42:54.801
THEMES ABOUT AS LIGHT AS YOU

01:42:54.868 --> 01:42:55.802
CAN GET FOR AN ELEMENT THAT'S A

01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:58.071
METAL- IT'S LIGHT WEIGHT AND

01:42:58.138 --> 01:43:01.208
IT'S SMALL AND FOR OUR PHONES

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:03.043
IN OUR CARS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED.

01:43:03.110 --> 01:43:04.344
NOW IF YOU DON'T CHARGE A

01:43:04.411 --> 01:43:07.714
LITHIUM ION BATTERY FOR A WEEK.

01:43:07.781 --> 01:43:08.715
YOU DON'T HAVE MUCH TRACHSEL

01:43:08.782 --> 01:43:11.752
HAFT- SO IF YOU JUST JUST

01:43:11.818 --> 01:43:13.854
SITTING THERE IT'S JUST CHARGES

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:16.223
DO YOU DOES YOUR IRON BATTERY

01:43:16.290 --> 01:43:18.625
DISCHARGE OVER THE PERIOD OVER

01:43:18.692 --> 01:43:22.329
PERIOD OF TIME. YEAH IT'S AN

01:43:22.396 --> 01:43:24.831
EXCELLENT QUESTION- THAT THE

01:43:24.898 --> 01:43:26.767
SHORT ANSWER IS YES WE DO

01:43:26.833 --> 01:43:29.336
EXPERIENCED SELF DISCHARGE. BUT

01:43:29.403 --> 01:43:31.171
THAT THE REALITY IS WE DON'T

01:43:31.238 --> 01:43:32.706
THAT OUR BATTERIES DON'T SIT

01:43:32.773 --> 01:43:35.375
THERE AND SAID I DON'T RATHER

01:43:35.442 --> 01:43:36.376
OUR BATTERIES ARE ACTUALLY VERY

01:43:36.443 --> 01:43:38.345
ACTIVE THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. SO

01:43:38.412 --> 01:43:39.846
WHEN WE LOOK AT KIND OF THE

01:43:39.913 --> 01:43:42.049
LEAST COST THE COST MINIMIZING

01:43:42.115 --> 01:43:43.584
MIX OF RESOURCES AND THE COST

01:43:43.650 --> 01:43:45.385
MINIMIZING WAIT IT TOOK TO

01:43:45.452 --> 01:43:47.087
OPERATE THESE ASSETS. WE

01:43:47.154 --> 01:43:48.221
ACTUALLY SEE THAT WHILE WE ARE

01:43:48.288 --> 01:43:49.656
PROVIDING SEASONAL STORAGE SO

01:43:49.723 --> 01:43:51.458
WE MIGHT BE HAVING KIND OF-

01:43:51.525 --> 01:43:53.226
CONSISTENT CHARGING OVER THE

01:43:53.293 --> 01:43:55.862
OVER SPRING OR- FALL ME HAVE

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:57.297
ACCESS RENEWABLE ENERGY AND THE

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:59.499
STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I AM KIND

01:43:59.566 --> 01:44:00.634
OF NET DISCHARGE THROUGHOUT THE

01:44:00.701 --> 01:44:02.336
SUMMER THROUGHOUT THE WINTER WE

01:44:02.402 --> 01:44:04.304
ACTUALLY SEE THAT- WE'RE REALLY

01:44:04.371 --> 01:44:05.639
KIND OF OPERATING ON A DAILY

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:07.107
BASIS DOING SOME CHARGING SOME

01:44:07.174 --> 01:44:09.076
DISCHARGING ON A DAILY BASIS. I

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:10.444
WE JUST HAPPEN TO BE CHARGING

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:12.746
MORE ON AVERAGE IN THOSE DAYS

01:44:12.813 --> 01:44:14.448
DURING THE SPRING MORE ON

01:44:14.514 --> 01:44:15.315
AVERAGE IN THOSE DAYS DURING

01:44:15.382 --> 01:44:17.618
THAT THE FALL AND- YOU KNOW

01:44:17.684 --> 01:44:18.785
LAST ON AVERAGE IN THOSE DAYS

ACTUALLY DON'T SEE VERY MANY

01:44:24.558 --> 01:44:25.692
CARRIERS WERE JUST SITTING

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:27.194
AROUND DOING NOTHING AND

01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:28.228
BECAUSE OF THAT THE SOUTH

01:44:28.295 --> 01:44:29.730
DISCHARGED CHALLENGE ISN'T

01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:30.530
REALLY KIND OF A COURT

01:44:30.597 --> 01:44:31.999
CHALLENGE THAT ECONOMIC YEAH

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:33.700
BUT CAN YOU DO THAT AND STILL

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:35.369
HAVE A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE

01:44:35.435 --> 01:44:37.571
DAYS OF RESERVE. BECAUSE I CAN

01:44:37.638 --> 01:44:39.006
ASSURE YOU NO POLITICIAN WANTS

01:44:39.072 --> 01:44:41.174
TO GO EVEN ONE DAY. WITHOUT

01:44:41.241 --> 01:44:44.745
ELECTRICITY. SO CAN YOU DO ALL

01:44:44.811 --> 01:44:46.980
THAT AND STILL HAVE A HUNDRED

01:44:47.047 --> 01:44:48.515
FORTY FIVE DAYS IN A RESERVE.

01:44:48.582 --> 01:44:52.853
MOST OF WHICH. CHARGING

01:44:52.919 --> 01:44:56.490
OCCURRED MONTHS AGO. I'M CAN

01:44:56.556 --> 01:44:57.691
YOU MAYBE EXPLAIN WHAT A

01:44:57.758 --> 01:44:58.759
HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE DAYS

01:44:58.825 --> 01:45:01.428
NUMBERS CAN. AB AS THE AMOUNT

01:45:01.495 --> 01:45:02.729
OF TIME WHEN YOU FOUND THAT

01:45:02.796 --> 01:45:04.998
THERE WAS. NOT ENOUGH SOLAR AND

01:45:05.065 --> 01:45:07.200
WIND THAT'S A HUNDRED AND FORTY

01:45:07.267 --> 01:45:10.270
HOURS. FORTY HOURS YES HUNDRED

01:45:10.337 --> 01:45:11.238
FORTY HOURS SO ALL RIGHT SO

01:45:11.304 --> 01:45:12.739
HUNDREDS OF **** THAT MAKES

01:45:12.806 --> 01:45:14.174
MORE SENSE I'M SORRY A HUNDRED

01:45:14.241 --> 01:45:15.809
AND FORTY HOURS NOT DAYS I

01:45:15.876 --> 01:45:17.511
SHOULD HAVE CAUGHT MYSELF

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:20.547
THERE'S SO HUNDRED ORDER. YES

01:45:20.614 --> 01:45:21.815
ONE OF IN ONLY THE THING THAT

01:45:21.882 --> 01:45:23.417
THAT DRIVES HOW MUCH ENERGY WE

01:45:23.483 --> 01:45:24.651
CAN START OUR BATTERY IS THE

01:45:24.718 --> 01:45:26.586
THICKNESS OF OUR ELECTORATE OF

01:45:26.653 --> 01:45:28.789
THE IRON ELECTRODES. SO IF WE

01:45:28.855 --> 01:45:29.956
YOU KNOW BASICALLY A HUNDRED

01:45:30.023 --> 01:45:31.425
HOURS IS THAT ESSENTIALLY ONE

01:45:31.491 --> 01:45:33.093
LAYER THICK. AND IF WE WANT TO

01:45:33.160 --> 01:45:34.428
MAKE IT TO OUR OUR TWO HUNDRED

01:45:34.494 --> 01:45:35.662
HOUR BATTERY WE ESSENTIALLY

01:45:35.729 --> 01:45:36.596
DOUBLE THE THICKNESS OF THE

01:45:36.663 --> 01:45:38.865
ELECTRODE. AND SO ESSENTIALLY

01:45:38.932 --> 01:45:40.467
PRODUCING LONGER DURATION

01:45:40.534 --> 01:45:41.868
BATTERIES TO COVER THESE LONGER

01:45:41.935 --> 01:45:43.537
DURATION EVENTS IS KIND OF A%

01:45:43.603 --> 01:45:45.238
PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CYCLE NOT A

01:45:45.305 --> 01:45:47.040
FUNDAMENTAL- TECHNICAL

01:45:47.107 --> 01:45:49.042
CHALLENGE SO YOU KNOW WHILE OUR

01:45:49.109 --> 01:45:50.577
FIRST PRODUCT IS A HUNDRED HOUR

01:45:50.644 --> 01:45:51.578
BATTERY BECAUSE WE THINK THAT'S

01:45:51.645 --> 01:45:53.413
WHERE THE MARKET WILL BE IN

01:45:53.480 --> 01:45:54.681
TWENTY. TWENTY FIVE TO TWENTY

01:45:54.748 --> 01:45:57.284
THIRTY. FIVE THERE'S NO KIND O

01:45:57.350 --> 01:45:57.851
FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGE THAT

01:45:57.918 --> 01:45:59.386
PREVENTS US FROM.

01:45:59.453 --> 01:46:01.021
COMMERCIALIZING EIGHT AT TWO

01:46:01.088 --> 01:46:01.922
HUNDRED HOUR BATTERY OR A

01:46:01.988 --> 01:46:03.056
HUNDRED AND FIFTY HOUR BATTERY

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.825
AND IN FACT WE ACTUALLY HAVE.

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:06.460
YOU KNOW HUNDRED FIFTY AND TWO

01:46:06.526 --> 01:46:07.494
HUNDRED OUR BATTERIES ON TEST

01:46:07.561 --> 01:46:09.563
AT OUR FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA

01:46:09.629 --> 01:46:12.265
AND- AND MESSAGES AND OVER THE

COURSE OF MARKET SHARE A MONTH.

01:46:17.070 --> 01:46:17.604
HOW MUCH SELF DISCHARGE WOULD

01:46:17.671 --> 01:46:19.072
THERE BE. IF YOU WEREN'T.

TALK ABOUT THE OVERALL ENERGY

01:51:51.604 --> 01:51:54.174
STORAGE REQUIREMENT. IT'S GOING

01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.909
TO MORE THAN TEN HOURS GOOD.

01:51:55.975 --> 01:51:58.845
THAT'S A BIG NUMBER. ANOTHER

01:51:58.912 --> 01:52:00.680
DOPE FOR MANY OF US SPEAKERS

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:03.183
AND FROM BURGER CORD THAT GIVE

01:52:03.249 --> 01:52:03.983
THEM UNDESERVEDLY GOOD

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:06.019
TECHNOLOGY FOR SHORT DURATION I

01:52:06.086 --> 01:52:08.688
WOULD SAY BETWEEN FOUR TO SIX

01:52:08.755 --> 01:52:10.290
HOURS GOOD. REALLY NOT A VERY

01:52:10.356 --> 01:52:12.325
GOOD BECAUSE OF A TECHNOLOGY

01:52:12.392 --> 01:52:13.893
FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE NUMBERS

01:52:13.960 --> 01:52:16.162
FOR SURE. EVEN ASSUMING VERY

01:52:16.229 --> 01:52:17.630
CAUGHT AGGRESSIVE COST ARGUES

01:52:17.697 --> 01:52:19.899
WITH HIM. AND THE LEADING

01:52:19.966 --> 01:52:22.969
LONGER TECHNO LOGY SUCH A

01:52:23.036 --> 01:52:24.637
PUMPED HYDRO COMPRESSED AIR

01:52:24.704 --> 01:52:29.242
STORAGE. I'M SORRY REALLY NEED.

01:52:29.309 --> 01:52:31.845
THAT'S WHY THERE IS. TO DOUBLE

01:52:31.911 --> 01:52:35.515
UP A STATE COST EFFECTIVE.

01:52:35.582 --> 01:52:37.717
JOGADOR FICA THE INDEPENDENT

01:52:37.784 --> 01:52:40.487
LONG RESISTANCE TO. RIGHT AND

01:52:40.553 --> 01:52:42.789
THAT'S RIGHT YOU KNOW MRS YEP

01:52:42.856 --> 01:52:43.957
HAVING THIS CONVERSATION IF

01:52:44.023 --> 01:52:48.661
IT'S- BUT HERE IS ANOTHER. AT

01:52:48.728 --> 01:52:50.263
THE SHOW WITH INFORMATION. I

01:52:50.330 --> 01:52:52.899
WAS DISTRACTED. BOB FROM THE

01:52:52.966 --> 01:52:55.468
DATABASE PUBLICATIONS ARE NOT A

01:52:55.535 --> 01:52:57.871
BUSINESS ON THE STORAGE. THE

01:52:57.937 --> 01:52:59.506
BIG CHART BIG SORT OF SHOWS YOU

01:52:59.572 --> 01:53:01.574
WERE BROUGHT WHAT ABOUT WHAT

01:53:01.641 --> 01:53:04.511
ABOUT THREE. FOR MORE THAN

01:53:04.577 --> 01:53:06.279
THREE THOUSAND RECORDS STRAW IN

01:53:06.346 --> 01:53:08.348
THIS PARTICULAR DATABASE. ORDER

01:53:08.414 --> 01:53:09.682
THAT TO CAME OUT ABOUT THE

01:53:09.749 --> 01:53:12.685
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE

01:53:12.752 --> 01:53:13.319
BATTERIES ARE BASED ON THE TIME

01:53:13.386 --> 01:53:14.087
ABOUT TWO WEEKS. AND SOME OF

01:53:14.154 --> 01:53:14.787
THEM ARE VERY BASIC FLOW

01:53:14.854 --> 01:53:18.124
BATTERIES. REPORTER WORKING

01:53:18.191 --> 01:53:20.226
LONG DURATION ENERGY STORAGE.

01:53:20.293 --> 01:53:23.530
THE SERVER DINOSAUR. SO THAT

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:24.330
SHOWS YOU THAT THERE IS

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:26.699
SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO GROW

01:53:26.766 --> 01:53:27.567
THE LONGER SENTENCES TO THE

01:53:27.634 --> 01:53:30.336
SPACE WHAT PROBABLY SHOWS

01:53:30.403 --> 01:53:32.939
DEVELOPMENT. DEMONSTRATION AND

01:53:33.006 --> 01:53:35.975
DEPLOYMENT OKAY IN CONSERVING

01:53:36.042 --> 01:53:37.977
THE PREVIOUS SLIDE WHERE A

01:53:38.044 --> 01:53:40.180
SHORTAGE MORE THAN TWO THIRDS

01:53:40.246 --> 01:53:40.780
OF THOSE ISSUES REQUIRED WOULD

01:53:40.847 --> 01:53:43.983
BE LOG DURATION THERE ARE MORE

01:53:44.050 --> 01:53:44.884
IMPORTANT THAN THE BEST MORE.

01:53:44.951 --> 01:53:46.386
OF OUR RESOURCES IN DEVELOPING

01:53:46.452 --> 01:53:47.954
COST EFFECTIVE LONGER SENTENCES

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:52.592
STORAGE. SO ARE YOU SURE SURE

01:53:52.659 --> 01:53:55.061
SOME TALKS WITH YOU. BASED ON

01:53:55.128 --> 01:53:57.096
SOME OF MY OWN EXPERIENCES BOTH

01:53:57.163 --> 01:54:00.133
WORKING AND PRIVATE SECTOR. I'M

01:54:00.200 --> 01:54:01.834
SORRY AS A PROGRAM MANAGER IN.

01:54:01.901 --> 01:54:04.237
OUR ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS

01:54:04.304 --> 01:54:06.773
AGENCY ENERGY IN. UP IN

01:54:06.839 --> 01:54:09.309
DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY AND THAT

01:54:09.375 --> 01:54:11.077
SHORT FORMS ARE PRETTY. WHICH

01:54:11.144 --> 01:54:13.346
IS AN AGENCY FARMS HIGH DECIDED

01:54:13.413 --> 01:54:14.547
WHAT PRODUCTS ARE BRENT THERE

01:54:14.614 --> 01:54:17.383
ARE A- AFTER WORKING AFTER

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:19.118
HAVING WHAT ELEVEN YEARS INTEL

01:54:19.185 --> 01:54:22.055
THE SEMICONDUCTOR COMPANY EVENT

01:54:22.121 --> 01:54:23.256
CORPORATE IS A PROGRAM DIRECTOR.

01:54:23.323 --> 01:54:24.357
NUMBER TO START UP AND THEN

01:54:24.424 --> 01:54:27.026
I'LL GET A LOT. BUT WHAT ARE

01:54:27.093 --> 01:54:29.229
SOME OF THE THAT I'VE SEEN.

01:54:29.295 --> 01:54:31.965
WHICH I THINK I MIGHT.

01:54:32.031 --> 01:54:32.465
PRINCIPAL PHOTOGRAPHY IS

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:35.368
GETTING INTO WHICH. FIRST OF

01:54:35.435 --> 01:54:37.437
ALL WE EVER LOOKED AT MANY

01:54:37.503 --> 01:54:39.606
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES READ THE

01:54:39.672 --> 01:54:40.840
ORIGINAL PROCESS IS THE

01:54:40.907 --> 01:54:42.842
SEMICONDUCTOR CHIP I WOULD

01:54:42.909 --> 01:54:45.178
TECHNOLOGY OR- BECOME A BATTERY

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:47.280
OR ANY OTHER KIND OF STORAGE IF

01:54:47.347 --> 01:54:50.950
FROM THE TIME YOU DISCOVERED OR

01:54:51.017 --> 01:54:52.752
INVENTED NEW IDEA. THE TIME IT

01:54:52.819 --> 01:54:54.287
IS SOLVE ALL MANUFACTURING'S

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:55.555
ISSUES YOU HAVE A SCALABLE

01:54:55.622 --> 01:54:58.258
TECHNOLOGY EVERYBODY TO DEPLOY.

01:54:58.324 --> 01:55:00.393
IT ROUGHLY TAKES FIFTEEN TO

01:55:00.460 --> 01:55:03.429
TWENTY YEARS. UNFORTUNATELY

01:55:03.496 --> 01:55:03.997
DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF TIME

01:55:04.063 --> 01:55:06.532
BECAUSE OF THE- REPORTER SO THE

01:55:06.599 --> 01:55:10.670
CLIMATE CHANGE. IT WITHIN TEN

01:55:10.737 --> 01:55:11.304
TO FIFTEEN YES SO WE JUST DON'T

01:55:11.371 --> 01:55:12.772
HAVE SO WE NEED A LITTLE BIT

01:55:12.839 --> 01:55:15.375
ABOUT I'M SHIFT DRAMATICALLY

01:55:15.441 --> 01:55:17.944
SCALING. NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

01:55:18.011 --> 01:55:20.046
NEW IDEAS RIGHT PARTICULARLY

01:55:20.113 --> 01:55:21.948
FOR LOW ENERGY AND ON TOP OF

01:55:22.015 --> 01:55:23.549
THAT ENERGY IS ALSO CALLED

01:55:23.616 --> 01:55:25.151
CONTRIBUTED BY THE FACT THAT

01:55:25.218 --> 01:55:28.621
POLICY. AND INDIVIDUALS A

01:55:28.688 --> 01:55:29.188
PRESERVATIVE IT'D BE BROKE.

01:55:29.255 --> 01:55:30.456
RIGHT SO I BELIEVE THAT WE NEED

01:55:30.523 --> 01:55:31.958
TO DEVELOP REALLY GOOD PRIVATE

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:35.228
PUBLIC. PARTNERSHIP A FRAMEWORK

01:55:35.295 --> 01:55:35.762
WHERE YOU CAN DRAMATICALLY

01:55:35.828 --> 01:55:37.463
ACCELERATE. DISCOVERED A

01:55:37.530 --> 01:55:41.067
MONSTER PLANET- TIME FRAME. AND

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:44.537
SOME OF THE OTHER. THAT WAS A

01:55:44.604 --> 01:55:46.205
PARTICULARLY AS AS A GOVERNMENT

01:55:46.272 --> 01:55:48.274
FUNDING AGENCY WHICH IS FUNDING

01:55:48.341 --> 01:55:50.476
FOR THE STATE OR FEDERAL. A

01:55:50.543 --> 01:55:52.512
REALLY GOOD IDEAS. ABOUT

01:55:52.578 --> 01:55:54.814
PERSONAL TECHNOLOGY NEEDS WELL

01:55:54.881 --> 01:55:56.582
AS YOU SHOULD DEFINE OBJECTIVES

01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:58.484
NOT JUSTICE FOR THE VICTIMS.

01:55:58.551 --> 01:55:59.952
LET THEY KNOW WE'RE JUST IT

01:56:00.019 --> 01:56:04.524
OUT. AND THEM. YES SOME OF

01:56:04.590 --> 01:56:06.192
THOSE IDEAS MAYES HAS BEEN

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:09.128
ARGUABLY THE BETTER ONES.

01:56:09.195 --> 01:56:12.465
HOWEVER IN THE WATER NOT ONLY

01:56:12.532 --> 01:56:14.667
THE BALL PARTY. ONLY THIS IS A

01:56:14.734 --> 01:56:19.605
LOT OF. SO TO THE RESIDENCE.

01:56:19.672 --> 01:56:21.708
SIMILARLY IT WAS- POLICY SHOULD

01:56:21.774 --> 01:56:23.609
BE ACKNOWLEDGED INDIVIDUAL BUT

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:24.944
THE SHOULD PRODUCE VIDEO TACTIC

01:56:25.011 --> 01:56:27.747
NOT ONLY GONZALEZ IS ON THE

01:56:27.814 --> 01:56:28.748
IDEA THAT THE FUNDING. SEE WHAT

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.783
MAKES SENSE. RIGHT TO GET YOU

01:56:30.850 --> 01:56:32.318
IN AS SOON AS I CAN WATER MORE

01:56:32.385 --> 01:56:33.886
INFORMATION YOU WANTED

01:56:33.953 --> 01:56:34.954
DEPLOYMENT OF DEMONSTRATION

01:56:35.021 --> 01:56:36.589
PROJECTS YEAH MORE INFORMATION

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:38.958
AVAILABLE TO MAKE THE COLLEGES

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:41.794
MEANT CALL. A COUPLE EXAMPLE

01:56:41.861 --> 01:56:43.129
FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE

01:56:43.196 --> 01:56:45.098
BECAUSE I WAS ON THE OTHER SIDE

01:56:45.164 --> 01:56:47.400
I WAS FUNDING. OF IDEAS. WHEN I

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:49.535
WAS IN OURBODY I FUNDED IT HI

01:56:49.602 --> 01:56:51.604
MY ONE OF MY PROGRAMS WAS ON.

01:56:51.671 --> 01:56:54.006
DEVELOPING A LOW GLOBAL WARMING

01:56:54.073 --> 01:56:58.044
POTENTIAL- RESURGENCE RIGHT

01:56:58.111 --> 01:57:00.146
SUFFERED A BUNCH OF PRODUCTS.

01:57:00.213 --> 01:57:01.180
ALL THE PRODUCTS WHICH ARE

01:57:01.247 --> 01:57:03.483
FUNDED FOR DEVELOPING GREEN

01:57:03.549 --> 01:57:05.518
SOLUTION FOR BUILDINGS. IN THE

01:57:05.585 --> 01:57:07.387
COURSE OF THE PROJECT I FOUND

01:57:07.453 --> 01:57:10.056
OUT. TO RIDICULOUS TECHNOGYM

01:57:10.123 --> 01:57:13.593
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS BECAUSE OF

01:57:13.659 --> 01:57:14.160
THE THAT WE STARTED GETTING

01:57:14.227 --> 01:57:15.361
FROM THE PROJECT. THAT THAT

01:57:15.428 --> 01:57:17.096
PARTICULAR TECHNOLOGY MADE MORE

01:57:17.163 --> 01:57:20.133
SENSE FOR THE REFRIGERATOR THAT

01:57:20.199 --> 01:57:23.703
DOESN'T HAVE CONDITION. AT

01:57:23.770 --> 01:57:24.804
ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM THE

01:57:24.871 --> 01:57:26.305
DECISION I SAID OKAY LET'S JUST

01:57:26.372 --> 01:57:28.207
FOCUS DON'T TRY TO FOCUS ON A

01:57:28.274 --> 01:57:30.910
PRODUCT AND DINNER CONDITIONER

01:57:30.977 --> 01:57:31.911
MAKE IT. WITH A REFRIGERATOR.

01:57:31.978 --> 01:57:33.346
BUT I COULD MAKE THE DECISION

01:57:33.413 --> 01:57:34.480
BECAUSE YOU'RE DOING THE

01:57:34.547 --> 01:57:36.682

EARLIER IT HOPE TO SHRINK THE

01:58:47.453 --> 01:58:48.955
TIMELINE FROM DISCOVERY'S LESS

01:58:49.021 --> 01:58:50.957

HUNDRED MEGAWATT HOURS. THE

02:00:25.885 --> 02:00:27.920
KIND OF ESTIMATES WE'VE GOTTEN

02:00:27.987 --> 02:00:29.855
FROM OUR LAST TWO SPEAKERS IS

02:00:29.922 --> 02:00:32.391
WE'RE GONNA NEED NOT FORTY FIVE

02:00:45.938 --> 02:00:48.441
CHEN IT'S- IT'S SORT OF

02:00:48.507 --> 02:00:50.176
UNBELIEVABLE THAT WE CAN DO IT

AND AGAIN OUR LAST SPEAKER IS

02:00:52.311 --> 02:00:54.380
SAYING WE HAVE TO DO IT BY

02:00:54.447 --> 02:00:56.849
TWENTY THIRTY NOW- ONE THING

TECHNOLOGIES WE HAVE DEVELOPED

02:01:06.225 --> 02:01:10.096
AND- SETTING UP- INCUBATORS

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:13.466
AND- THAT TRYING TO GET THAT

02:01:13.532 --> 02:01:17.169
TECHNOLOGY OUT. AND MY QUESTION

TAKING TWENTY FOUR YEARS OR

02:01:32.318 --> 02:01:34.854
WHATEVER TO DEVELOP WE HAVE TO

02:01:34.920 --> 02:01:36.155

IN MY INDUSTRY. CALIFORNIA'S

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:39.245
EFFORTS THERE HAVE PROMPTED I

02:03:39.311 --> 02:03:40.846
WOULD SAY THOUSANDS OF HOURS OF

02:03:40.913 --> 02:03:42.948

DIRECTED WAYS- WE HAVE A REALLY

02:04:04.003 --> 02:04:05.404
LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

02:04:05.471 --> 02:04:06.605
THAT SHOULD BE PART OF THE-

02:04:06.672 --> 02:04:09.275
TOOL KIT. BUT THEY NEED. HELP

02:04:09.341 --> 02:04:11.043
COVERING THAT GREEN PREMIUM AND

02:04:11.110 --> 02:04:12.244
ONE OF THE WAYS TO DO THAT IS

02:04:12.311 --> 02:04:13.212
WHAT WE CALL BY DOWN FUNDS

02:04:13.279 --> 02:04:15.681

AND SO WE'RE SUPPORT ABOUT ALL

02:04:21.854 --> 02:04:23.923
OF THAT- AND I CAN COME UP WITH

02:04:23.989 --> 02:04:25.791
MORE SOME MORE SPECIFIC-

02:04:25.858 --> 02:04:27.092
RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO MOVE

02:04:27.159 --> 02:04:28.227
FORWARD BUT I WANTED TO JUST

02:04:28.294 --> 02:04:30.563
START WITH THAT LIST- THAT'S

02:04:30.629 --> 02:04:31.797
EXCELLENT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:34.233
THE PAST TO BUY DOWN THE PRICE.

02:04:34.300 --> 02:04:37.703
IS TO TELL PG&amp;E AND EDISON AND

02:04:37.770 --> 02:04:41.674
OTHER LARGE UTILITIES- PURCHASE

02:04:41.740 --> 02:04:44.009
GREEN ENERGY. NOW THE BUY DOWN

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:46.712
COST WHERE WERE WE WERE PAYING

02:04:46.779 --> 02:04:49.281
FOR SOLAR FARM MORE THAN TEN WE

02:04:49.348 --> 02:04:51.684
WOULD FOR NATURAL GAS PLANT AND

02:04:51.750 --> 02:04:54.086
NOT GETTING THE FLEXIBILITY OF%

02:04:54.153 --> 02:04:57.156
NATURAL GAS PLANT THAT COST WAS

02:04:57.223 --> 02:05:00.059
DEAD BY THE RATE PAYERS. THAT'S

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:01.594
PART OF THE REASON WHY WE NOW

02:05:01.660 --> 02:05:03.929
HAVE SUCH HIGH ENERGY PRICES

02:05:03.996 --> 02:05:08.067
AND A MATTER OF FACT THE- THE

02:05:08.133 --> 02:05:13.539
CCC ARE. OUR COMMUNITY- ENERGY

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:15.007
COMPANIES WE'VE GOT NOW REALLY

02:05:15.074 --> 02:05:16.375
COMPLAIN MORE WE HAVE TO HAVE

02:05:16.442 --> 02:05:18.377
ALL OF THESE OLD COSTS WHY

02:05:18.444 --> 02:05:19.945
CAN'T WE JUST HAVE THE NEW

02:05:20.012 --> 02:05:22.047
SOLAR PANEL. BECAUSE WE ALL

02:05:22.114 --> 02:05:23.749
INVESTED IN THE OLD SOLAR AND

02:05:23.816 --> 02:05:24.917
WE ALL GOT TO CONTINUE TO PAY

02:05:24.984 --> 02:05:26.819
FOR IT BUT- AT SOME POINT THAT

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:28.387
BECOMES VERY DIFFICULT TO SAY

02:05:28.454 --> 02:05:29.622
THE RATE PAYERS ARE GOING TO

02:05:29.688 --> 02:05:31.457
PAY FOR IT ALSO THAT'S JUST ONE

02:05:31.523 --> 02:05:32.925
QUESTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO

02:05:32.992 --> 02:05:37.463
HAVE- CAN WE HAVE- DO WE HAVE

02:05:37.529 --> 02:05:39.665
SINCE. YEAH IT SUCKS BONTA. I'M

ALEX GET AROUND ALSO WE HAVE

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:49.808
SOME UNIQUE FEDERAL FUNDING

02:05:49.875 --> 02:05:51.510
OPPORTUNITIES IF WE POSITION

02:05:51.577 --> 02:05:53.212
OURSELVES TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:05:53.279 --> 02:05:54.613
THAT MONEY AND THAT'S A VERY

02:05:54.680 --> 02:05:56.315
LIVE DEBATE I KNOW THE CECE'S

02:05:56.382 --> 02:05:58.250
WELL POSITION ON THAT. IN HIS

02:05:58.317 --> 02:06:00.319
INDUSTRY AND DOES- CALIFORNIA'S

02:06:00.386 --> 02:06:01.053
POLICY LEADERSHIP AND

02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:03.522
LEGISLATURE WE CAN ALL GEAR UP

02:06:03.589 --> 02:06:05.557
AND STRATEGIZE TO DO THAT- INTO

02:06:05.624 --> 02:06:06.859
IT REALLY TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

02:06:06.926 --> 02:06:08.027
FEDERAL SUPPORT SO THAT IT

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:09.295
DOESN'T FALL AS MUCH ON

02:06:09.361 --> 02:06:11.730
CALIFORNIA RATEPAYERS. THAT'S

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.732
REALLY IMPORTANT AND I THINK

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.167
PEOPLE SOMETIMES SAY WE ARE

02:06:15.234 --> 02:06:19.939
ONLY RESPONSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA.

02:06:20.005 --> 02:06:20.773
5% OF THE GREENHOUSE GASES.

02:06:20.839 --> 02:06:23.642
WHAT ARE WHAT WE HEARD TODAY.

02:06:23.709 --> 02:06:26.278
IS YEAH WE'RE RESPONSIBLE 41%

02:06:26.345 --> 02:06:27.680
WE GOTTA DO OUR FAIR SHARE

02:06:27.746 --> 02:06:29.782
GETTING THAT DOWN BUT- WHAT

02:06:29.848 --> 02:06:31.116
PEOPLE ARE SAYING IS YOU'RE

02:06:31.183 --> 02:06:32.785
DEVELOPING THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR

02:06:32.851 --> 02:06:35.087
THE WHOLE COUNTRY. AND THAT'S

02:06:35.154 --> 02:06:36.956
IN FACT THE PLAN THAT WE

02:06:37.022 --> 02:06:38.624
DEVELOP THOSE TECHNOLOGIES THAT

02:06:38.691 --> 02:06:41.060
WE SHOW BY EXAMPLE. THAT'S ALSO

02:06:41.126 --> 02:06:43.329
THE REASON WHY WE CAN'T AFFORD

02:06:43.395 --> 02:06:44.330

02:07:12.257 --> 02:07:14.593
WAS FROM- DOCTOR BERGER FROM

02:07:14.660 --> 02:07:15.995
FOR MANAGING A SAID WE NEED A

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:17.629
HUNDRED HOURS. AND WE'RE

02:07:17.696 --> 02:07:18.897
TALKING ABOUT A HUNDRED HOURS

02:07:18.964 --> 02:07:22.067
FOR ROUGHLY TWENTY THOUSAND

02:07:22.134 --> 02:07:23.669
MEGAWATTS. AND IF YOU MULTIPLY

02:07:23.736 --> 02:07:25.537
A HUNDRED TIMES TWENTY THOUSAND

02:07:25.604 --> 02:07:26.572
YOU GET TWO MILLION SO TWO

02:07:26.638 --> 02:07:28.374
MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS.

02:07:28.440 --> 02:07:31.043
COMPARED TO WHAT WE DID LAST

02:07:31.110 --> 02:07:33.178
YEAR WHICH IS FORTY FIVE

02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:34.046
HUNDRED MAKE A LOT HOURS SO

02:07:34.113 --> 02:07:37.816
THANK YOU. JUST YOU GO FROM

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:38.417
FOUR THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED TWO

02:07:38.484 --> 02:07:39.685
TWO MILLION OR THREE MILLION OR

02:07:39.752 --> 02:07:41.520
THREE MILLION AND A HALF IT.

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:43.122
WILL RAISE WE'RE WE'RE DOING

02:07:43.188 --> 02:07:44.189
SOME ARM WAVING HERE IS

02:07:44.256 --> 02:07:46.792
SUPPOSED TO HAND WAVING BUT THE

02:07:46.859 --> 02:07:48.560
NUMBERS ARE JUST YOU AND- LLOYD

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:50.429
IS JUST GONNA TAKE A LONG TIME

02:07:50.496 --> 02:07:52.698
IF IT TAKES LONGER THAN WE HAVE

02:07:52.765 --> 02:07:54.700
SO WE'D BETTER. START NOW. MUST

02:07:54.767 --> 02:07:57.002
BE DEBT BY OTHER TWO QUESTIONS-

02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:59.271
AND ALEX APPRECIATE DID YOU

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.973
GIVING US YOUR INSIGHT IS JUST.

02:08:01.040 --> 02:08:03.475
JUST A GENERAL INSIGHT ON ON

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:05.344
TWO THINGS AND THAT IS. ON BY

02:08:05.411 --> 02:08:06.812
DOWN PROGRAMS FOR THE GREEN

02:08:06.879 --> 02:08:10.249
PREMIUM. IS IT BETTER FOR. THE

02:08:10.315 --> 02:08:12.584
STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO.

02:08:12.651 --> 02:08:14.353
COMPLETELY FUND- A PARTICULAR

02:08:14.420 --> 02:08:18.290
INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM- THE-

02:08:18.357 --> 02:08:19.925
INSTALLATION OF ELECTRIC

02:08:19.992 --> 02:08:22.094
CHARGING STATIONS FOR EXAMPLE

02:08:22.161 --> 02:08:25.130
OR IS IT BETTER FOR- THE STATE

02:08:25.197 --> 02:08:27.099
CALIFORNIA TO PROVIDE AND

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:28.801
INSTEAD OF SAYING IF YOU PUT IN

02:08:28.867 --> 02:08:30.369
ELECTRIC CHARGING STATION WILL

02:08:30.436 --> 02:08:33.272
WILL PROVIDE. 30% OF THE COST

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:35.674
OR 40% OF THE COST. TO TRY TO

02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:37.676
BUY DOWN THE GREEN PREMIUM FROM

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:39.078
YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHICH ONE IS

02:08:39.144 --> 02:08:40.612
GOING TO GET US THE

02:08:40.679 --> 02:08:42.381
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEED.

02:08:42.448 --> 02:08:44.817
THE FASTEST THE BEST OF THE

02:08:44.883 --> 02:08:45.884
BEST INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE

02:08:45.951 --> 02:08:49.254
NEED IT THE QUICKEST CENTER.

02:08:49.321 --> 02:08:51.023
YEAH GOOD QUESTION MISTER

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:52.324
BENNETT ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:53.592
YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK

02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:55.694
YEAH I HAVE A VERY. WIDE

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:56.895
MEMBERSHIP AND MANY OF THEM

02:08:56.962 --> 02:08:58.797
HAVE STRONG OPINIONS ON THE

02:08:58.864 --> 02:09:01.333
BEST WAY FOR THEM TO HELP- AND

02:09:01.400 --> 02:09:03.168
I DON'T HAVE THE RIGHT ANSWER

02:09:03.235 --> 02:09:04.470
FOR YOU IN TERMS OF ITS THIS

02:09:04.536 --> 02:09:06.238
WAY OR THAT WAY BUT I DO WANT

02:09:06.305 --> 02:09:08.273
YOU TO KNOW THAT. THESE ARE ALL

02:09:08.340 --> 02:09:10.242
COMPANIES WILLING TO PUT OUT.

02:09:10.309 --> 02:09:11.510
YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

02:09:11.577 --> 02:09:13.612
OF DOLLARS- THEY'RE INVESTING A

02:09:13.679 --> 02:09:16.448
LOT OF MONEY AND- YOU KNOW I

02:09:16.515 --> 02:09:18.750
THINK THAT THE REALITY IS. THEY

02:09:18.817 --> 02:09:20.519
DO THAT AS PART OF THE BUSINESS

02:09:20.586 --> 02:09:22.187
SO THEY NEED TO HAVE SOME

02:09:22.254 --> 02:09:25.157
VISIBILITY TO. WHAT THE RETURNS

02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:26.992
AND RISK CAR AND THAT'S ONE

02:09:27.059 --> 02:09:28.260
THING WE CAN REALLY CONTROL SO

02:09:28.327 --> 02:09:29.761
IF WE DO TAKE THE PATH OF AN

02:09:29.828 --> 02:09:31.630
INCENTIVE PROGRAM. I THINK IT'S

02:09:31.697 --> 02:09:34.233
EASY FOR THEM TO SEE- THAT

02:09:34.299 --> 02:09:36.068
RETURN PEACE AND THAT REDUCES

02:09:36.135 --> 02:09:37.703
UNCERTAINTY ALTERNATIVELY IF

02:09:37.769 --> 02:09:38.537
THE STATE WANTS TO ENTER LONG

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.005
TERM CONTRACTS THAT'S ANOTHER

02:09:40.072 --> 02:09:41.874
WAY OF REDUCING RISK ON. ON

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:42.975
THESE COMPANIES AND HELPING

02:09:43.041 --> 02:09:44.943
THEM GET CHEAPER FINANCING TO

02:09:45.010 --> 02:09:46.912
MAKE THE PROJECT PENCIL OUT.

02:09:46.979 --> 02:09:48.113
AND OTHER THAN THAT MAYBE YOU

02:09:48.180 --> 02:09:49.181
KNOW FORM WOULD HAVE A

02:09:49.248 --> 02:09:50.649
PARTICULAR OPINION OF WHAT

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:51.617
WORKS BEST BECAUSE I WHAT I SEE

02:09:51.683 --> 02:09:53.318
IS. A LOT OF COMPANIES HAVE

02:09:53.385 --> 02:09:55.387
DIFFERENT RISK APPETITES. AND

02:09:55.454 --> 02:09:57.389
DIFFERENT APPROACHES TO IT AND

02:09:57.456 --> 02:10:00.359
AGAIN MY- MY SENSE OF IT- AS A

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:02.261
GREAT EXPERT AND NOT JUST AS

02:10:02.327 --> 02:10:04.263
THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF C.

02:10:04.329 --> 02:10:08.066
SAYS THAT. THE NEEDS ARE HUGE

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:10.202
JUST CHECK CANTIK AND SO I'M

02:10:10.269 --> 02:10:11.537
I'M INTERESTED IN A BIT OF A

02:10:11.603 --> 02:10:13.038
SHOCK IN APPROACH FRANKLY.

02:10:13.105 --> 02:10:16.675
BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE FACING A

02:10:16.742 --> 02:10:18.177
LEVEL OF STORAGE DEPLOYMENTS

02:10:18.243 --> 02:10:19.545
THAT'S NEVER BEEN ACHIEVED

02:10:19.611 --> 02:10:21.547
EVER. YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF

02:10:21.613 --> 02:10:23.215
MEGAWATTS MEGAWATTS PER YEAR

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:25.417
IT'S NEVER BEEN DONE. AND SO

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:26.952
OPERATE JUST ABOUT THE

02:10:27.019 --> 02:10:28.487
EXECUTION PIECE FRANKLY.

02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:30.522
AMONGST MY SECOND QUESTION- IF

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:31.690
I COULD NOT SPEAK. ENGLISH

02:10:31.757 --> 02:10:34.493
PLEASE- AND THAT IS THAT. YOU

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:37.296
KNOW OF DR KIRCH SHOWED US.

02:10:37.362 --> 02:10:38.096
YEAH AND I KNOW IF YOU WERE

02:10:38.163 --> 02:10:39.565
ABLE TO BE ON DURING THAT PART

02:10:39.631 --> 02:10:40.799
OF THE PRESENTATION BUT SHOWED

02:10:40.866 --> 02:10:43.035
US- THERE IS THERE'S A

02:10:43.101 --> 02:10:45.504
SIGNIFICANT VALUE IN AND HAVING

02:10:45.571 --> 02:10:49.208
SOLAR. HAVING SOLAR CAPACITY-

02:10:49.274 --> 02:10:50.442
OR A COMBINATION OF SOLAR AND

02:10:50.509 --> 02:10:52.611
WIND CAPACITY TO TAKE CARE OF A

02:10:52.678 --> 02:10:54.713
100% OF OUR WINNER NEEDS. AND

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.648
THEN THAT WOULD BE FAR MORE

02:10:56.715 --> 02:10:58.517
THAN WE NEED IN THE SUMMERTIME

02:10:58.584 --> 02:10:59.351
BUT THEN WE COULD USE THAT

02:10:59.418 --> 02:11:01.853
SUMMER TIME- SOLAR AND WIND

02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:08.060
CAPACITY TO GENERATE LOW COST-

02:11:08.126 --> 02:11:08.727
HYDROGEN. AND THE OTHER TECH

02:11:08.794 --> 02:11:09.928
ALLERGIES THAT- SHE DESCRIBED

02:11:09.995 --> 02:11:11.730
THAT WE COULD USE WITH THAT. SO

02:11:11.797 --> 02:11:13.131
TO WHAT EXTENT DO YOU THINK

02:11:13.198 --> 02:11:16.068
FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE- IT WOULD

02:11:16.134 --> 02:11:17.336
MAKE SENSE FOR US TO GO AHEAD

02:11:17.402 --> 02:11:20.339
AND JUST. KEEP PUSHING ON THE

02:11:20.405 --> 02:11:23.475
SOLAR SIDE SO THAT WE LOWER THE

02:11:23.542 --> 02:11:25.944
COST OF THE SOLAR. ELECTRICITY

02:11:26.011 --> 02:11:28.480
WE HAVE PLENTY OF IT AND WE

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:31.149
HAVE. A LITTLE FOR LACK OF A

02:11:31.216 --> 02:11:33.418
BETTER WORD QUOTE INEXPENSIVE

02:11:33.485 --> 02:11:36.054
ELECTRICITY THAT IS AVAILABLE.

02:11:36.121 --> 02:11:37.489
FOR THE STORAGE OPTIONS THAT

02:11:37.556 --> 02:11:38.957
ARE OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S

02:11:39.024 --> 02:11:40.692
HYDROGEN OF THE OTHER OPTIONS.

02:11:40.759 --> 02:11:42.894
COULD CAN YOU GIVE ME YOUR SORT

02:11:42.961 --> 02:11:44.029
OF INITIAL REACTION TO THAT-

02:11:44.096 --> 02:11:46.365
THOUGHT. ABSOLUTELY YEAH GREAT

02:11:46.431 --> 02:11:49.201
QUESTION IN MY SENSE OF IT IS-

02:11:49.268 --> 02:11:51.436
THAT. WE NEED A BETTER BALANCE

02:11:51.503 --> 02:11:53.005
BETWEEN THE SOLAR GENERATION

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:54.740
AND STORAGE COMING ONLINE AND

02:11:54.806 --> 02:11:56.275
AS WE PUSH THE STORAGE FURTHER

02:11:56.341 --> 02:11:57.876
WE PUSH THE SOLAR FURTHER YOU

02:11:57.943 --> 02:11:59.878
NEED LONGER DURATION STORAGE.

02:11:59.945 --> 02:12:00.979
SO YOU REALLY WANT TO BE

02:12:01.046 --> 02:12:02.714
INCREMENTING FORWARD ON BOTH

02:12:02.781 --> 02:12:05.851
FRONTS AND- YEAH AS AS GAVE

02:12:05.917 --> 02:12:10.822
MENTIONED WE SEE RIGHT NOW HOW

02:12:10.889 --> 02:12:11.356
IF WE PUSH TOO HARD ON THE

02:12:11.423 --> 02:12:13.458
SOLAR. IT THEN IT'S HARD FOR

02:12:13.525 --> 02:12:14.626
THE GREAT TO OPERATE WITHOUT

02:12:14.693 --> 02:12:16.962
ENOUGH STORAGE EVEN NOW EVEN

02:12:17.029 --> 02:12:18.263
THIS SUMMER AND LAST SUMMER AND

02:12:18.330 --> 02:12:20.599
SO. I THINK AS WE PUSH LIKE YOU

02:12:20.666 --> 02:12:22.167
SUGGEST WE SHOULD ON THE

02:12:22.234 --> 02:12:23.402
SMALLER SIDE BUT WE NEED TO

02:12:23.468 --> 02:12:24.202
MAKE SURE THE STORAGE IS

02:12:24.269 --> 02:12:26.371
KEEPING UP. AND THAT IT'S

02:12:26.438 --> 02:12:28.540
ADDING TO ITS DURATION ACROSS

02:12:28.607 --> 02:12:30.475
TIME SO THAT IT CAN HELP SOLVE

02:12:30.542 --> 02:12:32.010
THESE PROBLEMS I GUESS AND

02:12:32.077 --> 02:12:33.245
THERE'S ONE OTHER QUICK NOTE

02:12:33.312 --> 02:12:34.279
REALLY SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU

02:12:34.346 --> 02:12:36.648
SIR- BUT I YOU KNOW THERE'S SO

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:38.116
MANY THINGS WE CAN DO WITH

02:12:38.183 --> 02:12:39.217
EXTRASOLAR IT'S A GREAT

02:12:39.284 --> 02:12:41.920
PROBLEM. AND ON ONE HAND- WE

02:12:41.987 --> 02:12:43.522
KNOW THAT CURTAILING SOLDIERS

02:12:43.588 --> 02:12:45.090
REALLY INEXPENSIVE QUICK

02:12:45.157 --> 02:12:47.726
SOLUTION. BUT THERE'S ALSO WAYS

02:12:47.793 --> 02:12:49.127
WE CAN USE SOLAR ENERGY WE CAN

02:12:49.194 --> 02:12:51.196
CREATE HEAT THAT THEN IS USED

02:12:51.263 --> 02:12:52.998
FOR DRYING PRUNES AND WHICH IS

02:12:53.065 --> 02:12:54.299
PART OF CALIFORNIA'S NEEDS

02:12:54.366 --> 02:12:55.667
RIGHT SO YOU THERE YOU CAN

02:12:55.734 --> 02:12:57.669
DRIVE ALL THESE INDUSTRIES.

02:12:57.736 --> 02:12:59.471
JUST WITH A LOT OF EXTRA CHEAP

02:12:59.538 --> 02:13:01.440
POWER IN CALIFORNIA I GUESS

02:13:01.506 --> 02:13:02.474
THAT'S WHAT I WANTED TO GET TO

02:13:02.541 --> 02:13:04.476
AND THAT IS THAT. IT IT

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:05.344
CERTAINLY THERE NEED TO BE A

02:13:05.410 --> 02:13:07.813
BALANCE BUT YOU COULD HAVE

02:13:07.879 --> 02:13:10.415
EXCESS SOLAR AND IT'S NOT TOO

02:13:10.482 --> 02:13:12.484
EXPENSIVE TO TURN IT OFF. IF

02:13:12.551 --> 02:13:14.853
YOU INCENTIVISED IT PROPERLY IN

02:13:14.920 --> 02:13:16.221
TERMS OF IDENTIFYING HEY THIS

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:17.989
IS. NOT STROLLER THIS GONNA

02:13:18.056 --> 02:13:19.391
NECESSARILYBE PURCHASED BY THE

02:13:19.458 --> 02:13:20.692
POWER COMPANIES RIGHT NOW

02:13:20.759 --> 02:13:23.929
EXCEPT FOR- BUT- WHAT YOU'RE

02:13:23.995 --> 02:13:26.231
PUTTING IN A PROJECT TO. EITHER

02:13:26.298 --> 02:13:27.766
SCALE THAT PROJECT LARGER THAN

02:13:27.833 --> 02:13:29.167
YOU THOUGHT BECAUSE OF THIS OR

02:13:29.234 --> 02:13:30.535
IF WE INCENTIVIZE PEOPLE TO

02:13:30.602 --> 02:13:31.636
SCALE IT LARGER THAN YOU

02:13:31.703 --> 02:13:34.239
THOUGHT. BECAUSE FIVE YEARS

02:13:34.306 --> 02:13:34.840
FROM NOW THE STORAGE IS GOING

02:13:34.906 --> 02:13:37.909
TO CATCH UP- AND NOW YOU'VE

02:13:37.976 --> 02:13:39.211
YEAH IT'S EASIER TO HAVE THE

02:13:39.277 --> 02:13:40.779
STORAGE CATCH UP IF YOU KNOW

02:13:40.846 --> 02:13:42.280
FOR SURE YOU'VE GOT THE ABILITY

02:13:42.347 --> 02:13:44.316
TO CREATE. EITHER LOW COST

02:13:44.383 --> 02:13:46.518
HYDROGEN OR LOW COST OTHERS

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:47.452
OTHER STORAGE OPTIONS I GUESS

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:49.421
THAT'S WHAT I'M- REFERRING TO

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:51.623
SO I. I'M JUST I'M REALLY

02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:52.324
TRYING TO CHALLENGE THE

02:13:52.391 --> 02:13:54.292
QUESTION THE ISSUE OF WHETHER.

02:13:54.359 --> 02:13:56.728
WE SHOULD NOT DO SOLAR UNTIL WE

02:13:56.795 --> 02:13:58.530
HAVE THE STORAGE OR WHETHER WE-

02:13:58.597 --> 02:14:00.399
YOU KNOW CAN DO THAT CAN MAKE

02:14:00.465 --> 02:14:02.834
ALMOST KIND OF LEAPFROG- AS

02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:04.669
THEY MOVE FORWARD TO SOME

02:14:04.736 --> 02:14:09.141
EXTENT. ANY FINAL YEAH I. YEAH

02:14:09.207 --> 02:14:10.041
THIS LONG TO BRING IN A STORAGE

02:14:10.108 --> 02:14:11.743
CAN MOVE AGREE. ON SOLAR SO.

02:14:11.810 --> 02:14:13.311
BECAUSE YOU CAN ALWAYS CURTAIL

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:14.946
AND- I THINK THE INCREMENTAL

02:14:15.013 --> 02:14:16.715
COST OF NEW SOLAR SHOWING TO BE

02:14:16.782 --> 02:14:19.184
QUITE INEXPENSIVE SO IT'S A

02:14:19.251 --> 02:14:21.119
IT'S NOT A- CHANGE YOUR

02:14:21.186 --> 02:14:22.521
STRATEGY AND IN TERMS OF GRID

02:14:22.587 --> 02:14:23.922
RELIABILITY BUT SHE JUST NEED

02:14:23.989 --> 02:14:24.823
TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE

02:14:24.890 --> 02:14:25.891
STORIES COMING ALONG OR ELSE

02:14:25.957 --> 02:14:27.392
YOU'RE REQUIRED. TO RELY ON THE

02:14:27.459 --> 02:14:28.693
OLDER UNITS YOU HAVE THESE

02:14:28.760 --> 02:14:30.295
DIFFERENT MANAGING ISSUES AND

02:14:30.362 --> 02:14:31.530
IF YOU ACTUALLY JUST KEEP THE

02:14:31.596 --> 02:14:33.298
OLDER UNITS ON UNTIL YOU GET

02:14:33.365 --> 02:14:34.132
THE RIGHT COMBINATION OF

02:14:34.199 --> 02:14:37.035
STORAGE ON. HAND AND SOLAR SO

02:14:37.102 --> 02:14:38.537
YOU KEEP IT IS THAT JUST AS A

02:14:38.603 --> 02:14:39.638
TERMINATION OF WHEN YOU SHUT

02:14:39.704 --> 02:14:41.039
THE OLDER UNITS OFFICE WHEN YOU

02:14:41.106 --> 02:14:42.140
HAVE THE PROPER AMOUNT OF

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:43.875
STORAGE DEGREE YEAH AND I CALL

02:14:43.942 --> 02:14:45.377
THAT FRANKLY TURNOVER IT'S VERY

02:14:45.444 --> 02:14:47.112
NORMAL PROBLEM AND WE SHOULD

02:14:47.179 --> 02:14:48.947
JUST APPROACH IT AND I THINK.

02:14:49.014 --> 02:14:49.915
THE LANGUAGE YOU GUYS ARE

02:14:49.981 --> 02:14:51.082
DEVELOPING TODAY IS ALSO

02:14:51.149 --> 02:14:53.285
HELPING EVERYONE YOU KNOW- NO

02:14:53.351 --> 02:14:55.320
DISCHARGED OR WHAT I CALL LONG

02:14:55.387 --> 02:14:57.522
HOLD STORAGE. IS A PROBLEM WE

02:14:57.589 --> 02:14:58.690
NEED AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT YOU

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:00.392
ASSOCIATE WITH SEASONAL STORAGE

02:15:00.459 --> 02:15:02.561
THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN- THE

02:15:02.627 --> 02:15:06.231
DAILY DISCHARGE STORAGE BECAUSE

02:15:06.298 --> 02:15:07.032
YOU MAY HAVE. A STORAGE THAT IS.

02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:07.566
HOUSE SELF DEPLETING

02:15:07.632 --> 02:15:09.067
CHARACTERISTICS BUT IF YOU'RE

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.535
USING IT EVERYDAY IT'S FUN AND

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:11.770
SO AS LONG AS WE CAN IN THIS

02:15:11.837 --> 02:15:13.305
LANGUAGE AND CLARIFY FOR

02:15:13.371 --> 02:15:14.639
INDUSTRY WHAT PROBLEMS TO

02:15:14.706 --> 02:15:16.208
SOLVE. IN MY EXPERIENCE IS

02:15:16.274 --> 02:15:17.809
THEY'RE THEY'RE WILLING TO SHOW

02:15:17.876 --> 02:15:19.711
UP FOR CALIFORNIA AND- PLACING

02:15:19.778 --> 02:15:22.781
BETS IN A GOOD WAY FOR US THANK

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:24.416
YOU OUR- MEMBER BENEFITS. I

02:15:24.483 --> 02:15:26.151
JUST REALLY QUICKLY I HAVE

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:28.553
SHOWN THAT IN. JANUARY SO IF

02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:30.322
YOU BUILD OUT SOLAR YOU'LL HAVE

02:15:30.388 --> 02:15:31.690
ENOUGH TO MEET THE LOAD HOWEVER

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.859
THAT'S A MONTHLY NUMBER. YOU

02:15:33.925 --> 02:15:35.794
STILL HAVE TO QUIT SO HE COULD

02:15:35.861 --> 02:15:37.028
WITHOUT MUCH SOLAR AND YOU

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:39.264
STILL NEED MORE STORAGE TO GET

02:15:39.331 --> 02:15:40.398
THROUGH THE NIGHT AND TO GET

02:15:40.465 --> 02:15:42.167
THROUGH A CLOUDY WEEK. AND IT'S

02:15:42.234 --> 02:15:43.134
JUST THAT YOU DON'T NEED AS

02:15:43.201 --> 02:15:44.669
MUCH SEASONAL BUT YOU ACTUALLY

02:15:44.736 --> 02:15:45.971
WHEN YOU DO THAT YOU'RE GOING

02:15:46.037 --> 02:15:48.139
TO ASK- ALEX WAS JUST SAYING.

02:15:48.206 --> 02:15:49.741
EVERY TIME YOU ADD MORE SOLAR

02:15:49.808 --> 02:15:51.276
YOU NEED TO USE TO ADD A

02:15:51.343 --> 02:15:53.645
COMMENSURATE AMOUNT OF STORAGE

02:15:53.712 --> 02:15:54.279
TO BE ABLE TO USE THE DAY TIME

02:15:54.346 --> 02:15:55.614
TO GET THROUGH THE NIGHT.

02:15:55.680 --> 02:15:58.016
EXCELLENT AND BY THE WAY- I HAD

02:15:58.083 --> 02:15:59.117
ONE NUMBER THAT THREE AND A

02:15:59.184 --> 02:16:00.619
HALF MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS

02:16:00.685 --> 02:16:04.189
THAT CAME FROM DOCTOR KURDS. 1%

02:16:04.256 --> 02:16:07.726
OF ROUGHLY FORTY MEGAWATTS- IS

02:16:07.792 --> 02:16:09.828
SORT OF THE KIND OF AVERAGE

02:16:09.895 --> 02:16:10.629
NUMBER FOR ELECTRICITY

02:16:10.695 --> 02:16:12.697
GENERATION CALIFORNIA MAYBE

02:16:12.764 --> 02:16:14.266
IT'S TWENTY OR SIXTY BUT IF.

02:16:14.332 --> 02:16:17.002
THAT'S IN THE BALLPARK. TIMES

02:16:17.068 --> 02:16:18.169
THREE SIXTY FIVE TIMES TWENTY

02:16:18.236 --> 02:16:19.037
FOUR AND YOU GET THREE AND A

02:16:19.104 --> 02:16:21.006
HALF MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS. SO

02:16:21.072 --> 02:16:23.041
THESE ARE JUST BALLPARK NUMBERS

02:16:23.108 --> 02:16:26.044
BUT- THE POINT IS YOU'RE

02:16:26.111 --> 02:16:29.681
COMPARING A MILLION. TWO FOUR

02:16:29.748 --> 02:16:30.282
THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. THAT'S

02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:31.383
THE KIND OF LEAP THAT WE HAVE

02:16:31.449 --> 02:16:33.318
TO MAKE AND VERY QUICKLY IF

02:16:33.385 --> 02:16:34.986
WE'RE TO BELIEVE DOCTOR BERGER

02:16:35.053 --> 02:16:38.156
WHICH I DO THAT THIS HAS TO

02:16:38.223 --> 02:16:42.227
HAPPEN BY TWENTY THIRTY. I

02:16:42.294 --> 02:16:44.129
WOULD LIKE TO MAKE A COMMENT ON

02:16:44.195 --> 02:16:48.333
THIS PLEASE ONE OF THE SO. LOOK

02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:50.268
WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE

02:16:50.335 --> 02:16:50.835
COMPLETE STORY YET SO THAT'S

02:16:50.902 --> 02:16:53.705
ANOTHER THING. THE SEATTLE ALSO

02:16:53.772 --> 02:16:55.674
NOT AVAILABLE IN THE HOME.

02:16:55.740 --> 02:16:59.044
OVERPRODUCTION BUT YOU WANT ONE

02:16:59.110 --> 02:16:59.578
FACTORIES WILL GIVE US SIX

02:16:59.644 --> 02:17:01.580
HOURS RIGHT. WITH THE FACTORY

02:17:01.646 --> 02:17:03.214
THE ECONOMICAL ECONOMIC OUTPUT

02:17:03.281 --> 02:17:05.617
OF A FACTOR DEPENDS ON WHETHER

02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:06.184
IT'S AND I NEED TWENTY FOUR

02:17:06.251 --> 02:17:08.253
HOURS OF OCT. REACH SO WHAT'S

02:17:08.320 --> 02:17:09.354
GONNA HAPPEN YOU WILL DISCOVER

02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:10.755
FACT IS IMPLEMENTED IN START

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:11.856
BURNING NATURAL GAS IN THE

02:17:11.923 --> 02:17:13.925
EVENING THE END PRODUCT. SO

02:17:13.992 --> 02:17:15.794
THAT'S BECAUSE HARD LOOK AT ONE

02:17:15.860 --> 02:17:17.195
ASPECT OF THE ENERGY ECONOMY

02:17:17.262 --> 02:17:18.363
AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE REST

02:17:18.430 --> 02:17:20.265
OF THE STUFF PEOPLE BELIEVES.

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:22.334
THAT ENERGY. SO THAT IS

02:17:22.400 --> 02:17:22.934
SOMETHING TO REALLY KEEP IN

02:17:23.001 --> 02:17:25.103
MIND AND THAT'S- THE SECOND ONE

02:17:25.170 --> 02:17:25.670
IS I WAS GOING TO SAY WATER

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:27.205
INFRASTRUCTURE. TO PRODUCE A

02:17:27.272 --> 02:17:30.508
LOT OF HYDROGEN. RIGHT NOW HE

02:17:30.575 --> 02:17:31.977
CANNOT. 100% HYDROGEN IN THIS

02:17:32.043 --> 02:17:33.445
DEBATE LINE IS NOT POSSIBLE

02:17:33.511 --> 02:17:36.348
THAT A LOT OF TECHNICAL RISK.

02:17:36.414 --> 02:17:38.783
WHICH IS WHICH IS A LONG. SO

02:17:38.850 --> 02:17:40.285
AND THE PEOPLE ARE TALKED

02:17:40.352 --> 02:17:41.553
ABOUT. WE'RE GOING 2% OF THOSE

02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:44.689
IN THE MIX WITH NATURAL GAS

02:17:44.756 --> 02:17:45.223
THAT DOESN'T GET YOU TO A

02:17:45.290 --> 02:17:47.158
REPRESENTATIVE WILL. EIGHT SO I

02:17:47.225 --> 02:17:48.693
GOT THAT WILL ALSO DECIDE HOW

02:17:48.760 --> 02:17:49.794
YOU WANT TO PRODUCE AN URGENT

02:17:49.861 --> 02:17:51.896
SHOULD BE BORN OKAY DODD WAS A

02:17:51.963 --> 02:17:52.931
PRODUCTION VOWED THAT USES

02:17:52.998 --> 02:17:55.000
GOING TO BE. SO DO YOU DON'T

02:17:55.066 --> 02:17:55.467
HAVE TO DOUBLE UP NEW

02:17:55.533 --> 02:17:59.070
PIPELINES. WHICH CAN PROTRUSION.

02:17:59.137 --> 02:18:00.138
SO THESE ARE THE KIND OF

02:18:00.205 --> 02:18:01.539
CONVERSATION THAT WE EVER HAVE

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:03.575
BEFORE DECIDING ON. WHICH

02:18:03.642 --> 02:18:05.176
STRATEGY MAKES SENSE UN

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:07.145
UNFORTUNATELY I'VE SEEN THAT.

02:18:07.212 --> 02:18:09.314
THERE TENDENCIES TO FOCUS ON

02:18:09.381 --> 02:18:10.615
ONE PART OF THE PROBLEM. I

02:18:10.682 --> 02:18:11.850
THINK THAT SOMEBODY HAS MATURED

02:18:11.916 --> 02:18:13.985
ON THE SPOT WEST OF THE PARK.

02:18:14.052 --> 02:18:17.489
AND AGAIN WITH THE TAGLINE THAT

02:18:17.555 --> 02:18:18.056
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TEN TO

02:18:18.123 --> 02:18:19.491
FIFTEEN YEARS. WE NEED TO START

02:18:19.557 --> 02:18:21.893
LOOKING AT EACH US BACKED OFF.

02:18:21.960 --> 02:18:22.927
THE PROBLEM ALL THE WAY FROM

02:18:22.994 --> 02:18:26.464
PRODUCTION TO DELIVERY TO USE.

02:18:26.531 --> 02:18:27.032
AND WHAT OTHER THINGS

02:18:27.098 --> 02:18:29.134
DOWNSTREAM EVEN OTHER TALENTED

02:18:29.200 --> 02:18:32.103
THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED. THE

02:18:32.170 --> 02:18:34.372
STRUCTURES AS BIGOTRY AGAINST.

02:18:34.439 --> 02:18:36.408
AND MISTER PARK MAY I JUST

02:18:36.474 --> 02:18:38.743
SPEAK WITHOUT HIGH POINT. YEAH

02:18:38.810 --> 02:18:40.679
THAT YOU KNOW AND SEE SO WE ARE

02:18:40.745 --> 02:18:41.913
TECHNICAL SO WE LIKE ALL

02:18:41.980 --> 02:18:44.215
STORAGE- WELL YOU'RE A BIG

02:18:44.282 --> 02:18:45.750
INFRASTRUCTURE STORAGE OR SMALL

02:18:45.817 --> 02:18:49.054
BATTERIES. AND HYDROGEN IS PART

02:18:49.120 --> 02:18:50.321
OF THE STORAGE TOOL KIT FROM

02:18:50.388 --> 02:18:51.956
OUR STANDPOINT HYDROGEN ALSO

02:18:52.023 --> 02:18:53.692
HAS SIMILAR BENEFITS YOU KNOW

02:18:53.758 --> 02:18:55.393
IT CAN APPLY TO INDUSTRY AND

02:18:55.460 --> 02:18:57.595
TRANSPORTATION APPLICATIONS. I

02:18:57.662 --> 02:18:58.697
JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT

02:18:58.763 --> 02:19:00.432
ALLEY W. HE'S DOING REALLY

02:19:00.498 --> 02:19:02.100
GREAT WORK AND E'RE AGAIN IN

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:03.535
CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW HAVE THE

02:19:03.601 --> 02:19:06.571
BENEFIT OF. A UTILITY THINKING

02:19:06.638 --> 02:19:08.506
AHEAD STICKING ITS NECK OUT AND

02:19:08.573 --> 02:19:09.374
I DO THINK WE SHOULD REALLY

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:13.044
LOOK AT IT MAKE SURE THAT

02:19:13.111 --> 02:19:14.746
THEIR- HYDROGEN EXPLORATION

02:19:14.813 --> 02:19:16.347
PROJECTS ARE SUCCESSFUL AND ONE

02:19:16.414 --> 02:19:17.382
OF THE THINGS THEY'RE DOING IS

02:19:17.449 --> 02:19:19.050
CALLED HIGH DEAL. WHERE THEY'RE

02:19:19.117 --> 02:19:20.285
GETTING ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS

02:19:20.351 --> 02:19:21.619
TOGETHER TALK JUST LIKE DOCTOR

02:19:21.686 --> 02:19:23.588
CRUSHER MACHINE IT SAYING AND

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:24.622
THEY'RE HAMMERING THIS OUT WHAT

02:19:24.689 --> 02:19:25.990
NEEDS TO HAPPEN WHEN WHAT ARE

02:19:26.057 --> 02:19:27.192
YOU GOING TO DO ON YOUR SIDE SO

02:19:27.258 --> 02:19:29.260
THAT I CAN MAKE MY SITE WORK.

02:19:29.327 --> 02:19:30.428
AND GETTING ALL THAT TOGETHER

02:19:30.495 --> 02:19:31.930
IS THE TYPE OF COORDINATED

02:19:31.996 --> 02:19:33.031
TACTICAL APPROACH I THINK MAKES

02:19:33.098 --> 02:19:34.733
A LOT OF SENSE. AND I THINK

02:19:34.799 --> 02:19:35.667
FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT

02:19:35.734 --> 02:19:38.169
LOOKING AT HOW DWP IS

02:19:38.236 --> 02:19:40.405
CONVERTING ITS- FORMALLY CALL

02:19:40.472 --> 02:19:42.907
UNIT IN UTAH INTO- HYDROGEN

02:19:42.974 --> 02:19:44.609
STORAGE- SYSTEM IS SOMETHING

02:19:44.676 --> 02:19:46.544
THAT. CERTAINLY WE WOULD WANT

02:19:46.611 --> 02:19:48.179
TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN TERMS OF

02:19:48.246 --> 02:19:49.814
MOVING THE NEEDLE FORWARD FOR

02:19:49.881 --> 02:19:52.317
THE STATE. AND YEAH I DON'T

02:19:52.384 --> 02:19:53.685
KNOW EXACTLY WHAT POLICY NEEDS

02:19:53.752 --> 02:19:55.153
THERE ARE TO FACILITATE THAT

02:19:55.220 --> 02:19:56.221
BUT I DO THINK THAT'S AN

02:19:56.287 --> 02:19:57.188
IMPORTANT ONE THAT WE SHOULD

02:19:57.255 --> 02:20:00.725
THINK ABOUT FOR. YOU SUPPORTING

02:20:00.792 --> 02:20:01.326
IT MAKING SURE IT'S SUCCESSFUL

02:20:01.393 --> 02:20:03.328
OUTSIDER. YES ANOTHER EXAMPLE

02:20:03.394 --> 02:20:06.030
OF. THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES

02:20:06.097 --> 02:20:06.898
WHERE WE'RE GETTING DOWN TO

02:20:06.965 --> 02:20:11.002
SOME PILOT INVESTMENT. BOY WE

02:20:11.069 --> 02:20:12.837
HAVE TO DEPLOY SO QUICKLY. IT'S

02:20:12.904 --> 02:20:17.308
SCARY. I'M MEMBER BENNETT I

02:20:17.375 --> 02:20:19.644
THINK THAT YOUR- QUESTIONS WERE

02:20:19.711 --> 02:20:21.713
QUITE HELPFUL AND I BELIEVE THE

02:20:21.780 --> 02:20:24.015
GENERAL AUDIENCE- IN THE WAY

02:20:24.082 --> 02:20:27.085
YOU SUMMARIZE THINGS WILL FIND

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:28.720
THE WAY YOU UNDERSTAND THAT TO

02:20:28.787 --> 02:20:30.822

KNOW OCCURRING LOW RENEWABLE

02:21:34.719 --> 02:21:35.987
ENERGY EVENTS SO NOW THAT WE'VE

02:21:36.054 --> 02:21:37.622
KIND OF DEFINED THAT PROBLEM

02:21:37.689 --> 02:21:39.190
AND PERHAPS WE CAN REALLY WORK

02:21:39.257 --> 02:21:40.325
TO FIND THAT PROBLEM EVEN

02:21:40.391 --> 02:21:41.359
FURTHER WORKING WITH THE

02:21:41.426 --> 02:21:42.560
CALIFORNIA ASKS OVER THE

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:43.528
CALIFORNIA PUBLIC UTILITIES

02:21:43.595 --> 02:21:45.129
COMMISSION. NO ANSWER TO FIND A

02:21:45.196 --> 02:21:46.531
PROBLEM HOW WE DEFINE PROGRAMS

02:21:46.598 --> 02:21:48.266
THAT THEN ORIENT THE MARKET

02:21:48.333 --> 02:21:49.901
TOWARDS SOLVING THAT PROBLEM

02:21:49.968 --> 02:21:51.536
AND THE KIND OF ALLOWING THESE-

02:21:51.603 --> 02:21:53.371
TECHNOLOGY PROVIDERS TO SCALE

02:21:53.438 --> 02:21:54.505
AND YOU KNOW REALLY CREEPY

02:21:54.572 --> 02:21:55.907
INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE STATE

02:21:58.676 --> 02:22:01.980
ADVANCE OF THAT SCALING- AND DO

02:22:02.046 --> 02:22:03.915
THAT AND KIND OF OUR A REALLY-

02:22:03.982 --> 02:22:05.216
A WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO MANAGE

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:07.285
RISK EFFECTIVELY SO I THINK

02:22:07.352 --> 02:22:08.686
THAT'S IT THAT'S- REALLY WHAT

02:22:08.753 --> 02:22:10.822

PAGE SUMMARY OF. WHAT WE

02:22:16.094 --> 02:22:18.363
LEARNED AND SO I'LL BE GETTING

SEASON ALSO- COOPER CITY'S TAX

02:34:23.387 --> 02:34:24.588
INCENTIVES MAY BE AN

02:34:24.655 --> 02:34:26.857
OPPORTUNITY PROGRAMS WHICH CAN

02:34:26.924 --> 02:34:27.658
BE FOR SOME OF THE COSTS ARE

02:34:27.725 --> 02:34:31.495
PROVIDED. THAT RESTRICT OUR IN

02:34:31.562 --> 02:34:33.130
THAT CASE. AND I THINK I ALSO

02:34:33.197 --> 02:34:33.831
THINK WE NEED TO HAVE

02:34:33.897 --> 02:34:34.999
SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT SYSTEM

02:34:35.065 --> 02:34:36.634
PERFORMANCE OF THE WHOLE PEOPLE

02:34:36.700 --> 02:34:39.570
TALK ABOUT- HOW BUT WHAT ABOUT

02:34:39.637 --> 02:34:40.537
THE OVERALL SYSTEM EFFICIENCY

02:34:40.604 --> 02:34:42.873
IS WIDE OPEN. I'M TIRED OF THIS

02:34:42.940 --> 02:34:44.975
AND THEY NEED TO GO UP MUCH

02:34:45.042 --> 02:34:46.343
MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN WHERE WE

02:34:46.410 --> 02:34:48.445
ARE. AND THEN. AREAS OF

02:34:48.512 --> 02:34:49.880
OPERATION FUNCTIONALITIES HOW

02:34:49.947 --> 02:34:53.250
DO YOU BRING THESE PRODUCTS TO

02:34:53.317 --> 02:34:54.184
REALITY ON THAT SCALE. IN THOSE

02:34:54.251 --> 02:34:55.786
THINGS THAT A LOOK SACRAMENTO

02:34:55.853 --> 02:34:57.488
COMES UP THAT'S BANQUETING

02:34:57.554 --> 02:35:00.424
SALAS. I PROGRAM LIKE CZ BRING

02:35:00.491 --> 02:35:03.761
IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO HAVE-

02:35:03.827 --> 02:35:06.330
DEAL WORLDS AND IF YOU SO BUT

02:35:06.397 --> 02:35:08.065
WE ALSO OF THE LITTLE ONLY IN

02:35:08.132 --> 02:35:11.235
THE PROCESS. IN THIS SENSE OF

02:35:11.301 --> 02:35:13.771
IN USING. HAS BEEN BEATING THE

02:35:13.837 --> 02:35:17.374
AREA- OTHER STATESYOUR- NOT TO

02:35:17.441 --> 02:35:20.077
MY SODA JUST AMOUNTS TO WAS TO.

02:35:20.144 --> 02:35:23.414
A SUPPORT LONGER ACTIONS. BUT

02:35:23.480 --> 02:35:24.014
MOST OF THESE BUT IT'S AN OF

02:35:24.081 --> 02:35:26.283
SKILL. TO BECOMES SEASON AND I

02:35:26.350 --> 02:35:27.951
STORAGE IS THAT THE MOST A

02:35:28.018 --> 02:35:30.087
LONGER MAYBE HOURS HOURS BUT

02:35:30.154 --> 02:35:31.021
NOT NECESSARILY ONE CAN SAY

02:35:31.088 --> 02:35:35.993
THESE ARE. R. D. O. E. R. OF

02:35:36.060 --> 02:35:37.061
ELECTORS THE I THINK IN THIS IS

02:35:37.127 --> 02:35:39.163
A OFFICE. AS BEEN SETTLED TO

02:35:39.229 --> 02:35:40.264
SUPPORTING THE MOST BUT THERE

02:35:40.330 --> 02:35:41.932
FOR MANY YEARS. AND THIS OFFICE

02:35:41.999 --> 02:35:43.467
IS JUST BEGINNING TO SEE LONGER

02:35:43.534 --> 02:35:44.735
ACTION STORAGE AND SEASONAL

02:35:44.802 --> 02:35:47.004
STORE IN THE- AREA. I TOOK A

02:35:47.071 --> 02:35:48.572
LOT OF THE ASPECTS AND ALSO YOU

02:35:48.639 --> 02:35:50.974
KNOW- BRINGING THE CLIP THE

02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:53.777
BODIES- EDUCATIONAL-

02:35:53.844 --> 02:35:56.447
INFORMATION- TO DO SO THAT THEY

02:35:56.513 --> 02:36:00.250
CAN MAKE. THAT A POLICY MAKING.

02:36:00.317 --> 02:36:01.985
SO ASK FOR UPPER OPEN

02:36:02.052 --> 02:36:04.154
GOVERNMENTS SO. YOU KNOW THESE

02:36:04.221 --> 02:36:07.191
USUALLY FROM OUR DEAL YOU FALL.

02:36:07.257 --> 02:36:10.260
AND THEY DON'T OPPORTUNITIES.

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:12.863
THROUGH THE- I AM AND ALSO FOR

02:36:12.930 --> 02:36:14.665
THE GRANDCHILDREN PROGRAM WHICH

02:36:14.732 --> 02:36:16.033
WAS ANNOUNCED A YEAR AND A HALF

02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:17.434
AGO I WHICH I'LL TALK A LITTLE

02:36:17.501 --> 02:36:20.304
BIT OF. AND THE SECOND QUESTION

02:36:20.370 --> 02:36:22.005
THE COMMITTEE ASKED ME TO

02:36:22.072 --> 02:36:24.775
ADDRESS THIS. WHAT POLICY AND

02:36:24.842 --> 02:36:26.343
THE COLLECTIVE BODY IF EXIST

02:36:26.410 --> 02:36:27.277
BUT STILL IMAGES STORIES

02:36:27.344 --> 02:36:30.647
TELLEMENT UNDEFINED. I WOULD

02:36:30.714 --> 02:36:31.882
SAY YOUR BILL IF YOU CAN OTHER

02:36:31.949 --> 02:36:34.318
POSSIBLE TO BOOK ABOUT STATE IT

02:36:34.384 --> 02:36:36.420
USUALLY MEANS RETAIL MARKET.

02:36:36.487 --> 02:36:38.155
AND AS A FELLOW THAT YOU ASSUME

02:36:38.222 --> 02:36:39.389
IT'S ENOUGH WHAT THE MARKET THE

02:36:39.456 --> 02:36:42.459
FEDERAL ELECTIONS. BUT THEY

02:36:42.526 --> 02:36:44.728
TELL US THAT. BUT A CALM THAT

02:36:44.795 --> 02:36:45.896
WE LOOK AT THE STATE OUR OTHER

02:36:45.963 --> 02:36:48.532
PHONE LEVELS. AND UNIQUE-

02:36:48.599 --> 02:36:51.602
LOOKING SPECIFIC. I DO GIVE YOU

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:54.605
A COUPLE EXAMPLES- THERE IS A

02:36:54.671 --> 02:36:55.672
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NOT THE

02:36:55.739 --> 02:36:56.607
MARKET THAT IS LEAKING THAT'S

02:36:56.673 --> 02:36:58.642
THE CONSENSUS OF WHAT A MEETING

02:36:58.709 --> 02:37:01.845
INVITE LONGER STORAGE. I THINK

02:37:01.912 --> 02:37:02.279
WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

02:37:02.346 --> 02:37:05.048
DEFINITIONAL- INFORMATION ON

02:37:05.115 --> 02:37:08.085
BOARD THE STORAGE OF STUDENTS

02:37:08.152 --> 02:37:09.153
SO IT NEEDS. AND UP AND

02:37:09.219 --> 02:37:12.790
EVALUATING- THESE TECHNOLOGIES-

02:37:12.856 --> 02:37:14.291
FOR THE MARKETPLACE WE NEED TO

02:37:14.358 --> 02:37:15.325
THINK ABOUT THE SYSTEMS I AM.

02:37:15.392 --> 02:37:18.095
ESTIMATING AND CAN IT DO

02:37:18.162 --> 02:37:20.030
INSTANTANEOUS TOWARD THE TAP

02:37:20.097 --> 02:37:21.965
THE LAUGHING GLASS THAT YOU

02:37:22.032 --> 02:37:24.168
NEED. AND HOW DOES THE SYSTEM

02:37:24.234 --> 02:37:25.369
CYCLE FOR- FOR GOOD

02:37:25.435 --> 02:37:26.570
APPLICATIONS AND WE'RE TALKING

02:37:26.637 --> 02:37:28.038
OF THE DATA MOST OF THE ASSETS

02:37:28.105 --> 02:37:29.973
OF TWENTY THIRTY FORTY YEARS SO

02:37:30.040 --> 02:37:32.309
BASICALLY OPERATORS- HAVE TO

02:37:32.376 --> 02:37:33.877
HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THESE

02:37:33.944 --> 02:37:35.145
SYSTEMS CAN CYCLE LIKE PUMPED

02:37:35.212 --> 02:37:36.480
HYDRO WE NOW HAVE FIFTY

02:37:36.547 --> 02:37:38.782
LETTERS. AND THAT OPERATIONAL

02:37:38.849 --> 02:37:42.986
LIFETIME. CAN THESE ASSETS LAST

02:37:43.053 --> 02:37:44.388
LONGTIME. SO COMPANY AT THE WE

02:37:44.454 --> 02:37:46.890
GET THIS THINKING IT. AND THEN

02:37:46.957 --> 02:37:48.592
THE OTHER ASPECT IS APPLICATION

02:37:48.659 --> 02:37:50.961
BOTH FOR- MONDAY BIRDS AND SEE

02:37:51.028 --> 02:37:52.830
THE START YOU KNOW I'S KIND OF

02:37:52.896 --> 02:37:54.131
BUT COMPOUNDED BY FUNDAMENTAL

02:37:54.198 --> 02:37:56.200
DIFFERENCES IN TECHNOLOGY SIX.

02:37:56.266 --> 02:37:57.701
AND ALSO WHAT OTHER POTENTIAL

02:37:57.768 --> 02:37:59.036
APPLICATIONS AND WHAT THE REAL

02:37:59.102 --> 02:38:02.472
VALUE. OF OKAY AGAIN THE- A

02:38:02.539 --> 02:38:04.575
PRODUCT OF LOCALS ALL OPERATORS

02:38:04.641 --> 02:38:08.745
CAN. CAN MAKE SENSE FINANCIALLY.

02:38:08.812 --> 02:38:10.581
AND THEN FOR THE MOST WE HAVE

02:38:10.647 --> 02:38:12.883
BEEN TALKING ABOUT LONG. BEFORE

02:38:12.950 --> 02:38:14.218
US I THINK ONE OF MY COULD BE

02:38:14.284 --> 02:38:16.220
USED IN THE B. BEING AT THAT'S

02:38:16.286 --> 02:38:17.888
REALLY ABOUT IT- IS A GOOD

02:38:17.955 --> 02:38:19.056
THING CAME ABOUT LEAST ANOTHER

02:38:19.122 --> 02:38:23.861
THINKS. BUT POLICY MAKE. ARE

02:38:23.927 --> 02:38:24.695
JUST BEGINNING TO SEE OFFENSE.

02:38:24.761 --> 02:38:26.563
MAY IS A IS A IS THAT HE ASKED

02:38:26.630 --> 02:38:29.066
SPOT FOR THE NEXT. BUT WE

02:38:29.132 --> 02:38:31.268
HAVEN'T. TALKED ABOUT ANYTHING

02:38:31.335 --> 02:38:34.571
BEYOND TEN HOURS. MOST OF THE

02:38:34.638 --> 02:38:35.772
LONG DURATION I THINK YOU CAN

02:38:35.839 --> 02:38:38.375
LOOK AT IT- ESPECIALLY THOSE

02:38:38.442 --> 02:38:39.676
BENEFITS ON BETTER TECHNOLOGY

02:38:39.743 --> 02:38:41.078
THAT THE BATTERIES. I THINK

02:38:41.144 --> 02:38:43.247
THAT'LL BE COMING TO THE POINT.

02:38:43.313 --> 02:38:46.917
POPOVICH HOW CAN YOU WILL GO

02:38:46.984 --> 02:38:50.287
BEYOND- WHAT HOURS BUT A LOT OF

02:38:50.354 --> 02:38:52.222
LOT OF IDENTIFICATIONS I THINK

02:38:52.289 --> 02:38:53.190
IT THAT THAT PROCESS IS STILL A

02:38:53.257 --> 02:38:57.361
ONE. THEN THERE IS THAT POLICY

02:38:57.427 --> 02:38:59.129
ASPECTS- THAT THAT THEY CAN

02:38:59.196 --> 02:39:02.232
DELAY TELEMUNDO FLOW OF MAKING.

02:39:02.299 --> 02:39:04.768
AND THAT MEETS THE- NEEDS TO

02:39:04.835 --> 02:39:06.703
HAPPEN QUICKLY. SO THAT WE CAN

02:39:06.770 --> 02:39:09.740
HAVE A MARKET PLACE FOR-

02:39:09.806 --> 02:39:11.909
SEASONAL STORAGE. THIS IS WHERE

02:39:11.975 --> 02:39:15.379
WE HAVE SOME LEVEL OF- POLICY I

02:39:15.445 --> 02:39:17.614
THINK OF THE- THE POLICY

02:39:17.681 --> 02:39:19.316
FRAMEWORK IS VERY PRESCRIPTIVE

02:39:19.383 --> 02:39:20.417
THEN YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE

02:39:20.484 --> 02:39:22.819
GIVING PREFERENTIAL BATTERIES

02:39:22.886 --> 02:39:24.121
OR OTHER TECHNOLOGIES. AND

02:39:24.187 --> 02:39:26.189
THEN- AS I MENTIONED EARLIER I

02:39:26.256 --> 02:39:26.890
THINK THAT A LOT OF INPUTS

02:39:26.957 --> 02:39:28.392
MIGHT BECOME AND JEEP

02:39:28.458 --> 02:39:30.894
REPUBLICAN- WANTED SO BADLY I

02:39:30.961 --> 02:39:31.929
THINK IT MIGHT BE LOOK AT THE

02:39:31.995 --> 02:39:33.096
CURRENT REGULATORY FRAMEWORK I

02:39:33.163 --> 02:39:34.264
DON'T NEED THE CHEMICAL NOT IF

02:39:34.331 --> 02:39:37.501
YOU'LL I THINK THAT NEEDS TO

02:39:37.567 --> 02:39:38.068
CHANGE. YEAH AND THEN IF YOU

02:39:38.135 --> 02:39:41.104
LOOK AT THE LEVEL I THINK- MANY

02:39:41.171 --> 02:39:42.739
STATES DO NOT HAVE ANY POLICY

02:39:42.806 --> 02:39:44.474
BENEFITS FOR THE DENTAL. AND

02:39:44.541 --> 02:39:47.277
THE LONG DIRECTIONS BUT SEVEN

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:49.913
DOT. ONLY FOR STATES HAVE. SOME

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:51.882
SUBSTANTIAL LEVEL UP A POLICY

02:39:51.949 --> 02:39:53.884
THAT WOULD MEAN IN A STORAGE.

02:39:53.951 --> 02:39:55.585
BUT ONLY A FEW LIKE A TWENTY OF

02:39:55.652 --> 02:39:57.154
THE DOUBLE ADDRESSING ON

02:39:57.220 --> 02:39:58.221
DIRECTION AND SEE THEM ONLY

02:39:58.288 --> 02:40:00.958
JUST BEING DROPPED. SO YOU THAT

02:40:01.024 --> 02:40:02.192
SENSE I THINK IT OFF- YOU

02:40:02.259 --> 02:40:04.695
SHOULD THE ART INCONSISTENCY IN.

02:40:04.761 --> 02:40:08.966
CONSISTENT IS IN PARTNERSHIP.

02:40:09.032 --> 02:40:11.568
THE TERM AND HOW ARE THESE ARE

02:40:11.635 --> 02:40:13.203
GOING TO BE- THAT'S ONE GO ASK

02:40:13.270 --> 02:40:15.439
BECAUSE MORE LONGER STORAGE.

02:40:15.505 --> 02:40:17.808
BUT NOT LIKELY TO EXPENSIVE-

02:40:17.874 --> 02:40:19.743
ADRIAN NOT SUPPOSE SITES COST

02:40:19.810 --> 02:40:20.777
SO YOU NEED TO HAVE A GOOD

02:40:20.844 --> 02:40:24.948
FRAMEWORK ON HOW TO HOW DO YOU-

02:40:25.015 --> 02:40:27.651
SEE THE OWNERSHIP ISSUES. AND

02:40:27.718 --> 02:40:30.020
THEN FOR ME TO MARKETS AT THE

02:40:30.087 --> 02:40:31.288
THAT IT BASS I WOULD BEEN TO

02:40:31.355 --> 02:40:33.357
OUR SMOKE BACK PLEASE TRY

02:40:33.423 --> 02:40:36.159
ACTION. OBLIGATIONS SO THEY DID

02:40:36.226 --> 02:40:36.793
NOT HAVE THE HASN'T BEEN

02:40:36.860 --> 02:40:38.261
OPPORTUNITY FOR LONG DURATION

02:40:38.328 --> 02:40:41.164
TO COME INTO THE PARTICIPATING

02:40:41.231 --> 02:40:43.300
BY. THAT TO CHANGE. THEN THAT

02:40:43.367 --> 02:40:44.935
EVEN THE IS ABOUT LEVEL WELL

02:40:45.002 --> 02:40:47.104
THAT'S AT ENOUGH- I YOU LOOK AT

02:40:47.170 --> 02:40:51.008
IT I THINK- A LONGER AGAINST

02:40:51.074 --> 02:40:53.377
ALWAYS THAT BE IN. ABSOLUTE

02:40:53.443 --> 02:40:57.014
WITH HAVE- A GOOD FAMILY FOR-

02:40:57.080 --> 02:40:58.048
THEY'VE BEEN OPPORTUNITIES FOR

02:40:58.115 --> 02:41:00.150
US LONGER OF A SEASONAL STORAGE

02:41:00.217 --> 02:41:02.119
THE WHOLE ACT YEAH. THAT'S A

02:41:02.185 --> 02:41:04.721
AREA I THINK IT. OF ME GETTING

02:41:04.788 --> 02:41:08.358
EXT. AND IN PLACES YOU HAVE AT

02:41:08.425 --> 02:41:10.927
BEST BUY- THE AIM IS TO ENSURE

02:41:10.994 --> 02:41:14.264
RESULT IT WAS THE- POSSIBLE.

02:41:14.331 --> 02:41:15.899
AND THAT THEY DO NOT A NOT TO

02:41:15.966 --> 02:41:18.568
KEEP OF NATION. I CAN TELL TO

02:41:18.635 --> 02:41:20.037
THE DOLLAR. I THINK IT'S A GOOD

02:41:20.103 --> 02:41:25.108
ASPECT. AND MAY NOT BE ALL THAT.

02:41:25.175 --> 02:41:26.877
SO I THINK KNOW THE POLICY-

02:41:26.943 --> 02:41:28.011
THINGS THAT NEED TO BE

02:41:28.078 --> 02:41:29.846
ADDRESSED AND OTHER THINGS

02:41:29.913 --> 02:41:31.681
WHICH WE DON'T HAVE POLICY IS

02:41:31.748 --> 02:41:33.383
LOCKED UP I THINK IF YOU WANT

02:41:33.450 --> 02:41:35.252
TO BRING A TECHNOLOGIST MARKET-

02:41:35.318 --> 02:41:36.720
ESPECIALLY THOSE WHICH ARE NOT

02:41:36.787 --> 02:41:38.488
REALLY MATURE I THINK WE NEED

02:41:38.555 --> 02:41:40.557
TO HAVE AT POLICYMAKERS. WE

02:41:40.624 --> 02:41:41.558
HAVE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR

02:41:41.625 --> 02:41:43.427
THE NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OTHER

02:41:43.493 --> 02:41:45.362
ASPECT IS. WHAT DRIVES THE

02:41:45.429 --> 02:41:47.097
INDUSTRY USE THE STANDARDS OF A

02:41:47.164 --> 02:41:48.065
FRIEND AND HAVING GOT

02:41:48.131 --> 02:41:50.567
STANDARDIZED PROCESSES FOR A- A

02:41:50.634 --> 02:41:53.103
TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS. AND

02:41:53.170 --> 02:41:53.603
STREAMLINED BUT IT DON'T

02:41:53.670 --> 02:41:55.238
MATTER. ESPECIALLY AROUND

02:41:55.305 --> 02:41:56.506
ENOUGH OF YOU TO DO THE COST OF

02:41:56.573 --> 02:41:59.843
INSTALLATION. OPERATIONAL

02:41:59.910 --> 02:42:02.045
ISSUES. IT WAS CAN HELP YEAH

02:42:02.112 --> 02:42:02.979
THOSE ARE THE I THINK THE

02:42:03.046 --> 02:42:05.215
KEEPER- IN AT THIS LEVEL. OTHER

02:42:05.282 --> 02:42:06.883
ARTISTS LEVEL ARE HOW DO YOU

02:42:06.950 --> 02:42:09.653
GETTHEM. NUMBER STORY ALSO

02:42:09.719 --> 02:42:12.189
STORAGE ACCEPT IN THE MARKET.

02:42:12.255 --> 02:42:13.190
AND COMING TO THE LOS QUESTION

02:42:13.256 --> 02:42:17.060
CAN FELLOW FOR SUCH- FUNDING TO

02:42:17.127 --> 02:42:18.161
BE LEVERAGE TO AID IN THE

02:42:18.228 --> 02:42:19.162
DEVELOPMENT OF LONG DURATION

02:42:19.229 --> 02:42:20.430
ENERGY STORAGE I THINK MY

02:42:20.497 --> 02:42:21.665
ANSWER TO THAT SO WE CAN I CAN

02:42:21.731 --> 02:42:24.634
LOOK AT- FISCAL TWENTY TWO-

02:42:24.701 --> 02:42:26.770

HUNDRED NINETY MILLION DOLLARS.

02:42:31.441 --> 02:42:33.510
FOR A FAMILY OBVIOUSLY SUCH NOT

02:42:33.577 --> 02:42:35.045
AS MANY A SELLOUT DEMONSTRATION

02:42:35.112 --> 02:42:37.414
PROJECTS BUT- IF YOU LOOK AT

02:42:37.481 --> 02:42:38.582
THE BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE

02:42:38.648 --> 02:42:41.218
FRAMEWORK- THEN THERE ARE

02:42:41.284 --> 02:42:42.519
THINGS YOU KNOW. TRANSMISSIONS

02:42:42.586 --> 02:42:44.688
IS DUMB AND- THE CONCLUSION

02:42:44.754 --> 02:42:46.523
BILL HAS MADE A MISMATCH FOR

02:42:46.590 --> 02:42:47.791
LINDA PEANUT TECHNOLOGIES SO

02:42:47.858 --> 02:42:49.426
THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES

02:42:49.493 --> 02:42:54.865
IN THE IN THE END UP COMING. TO

02:42:54.931 --> 02:42:56.766
A FEDERAL BUDGET. AND THE THEY-

02:42:56.833 --> 02:43:00.504
OF BILL. WITH THE I JUST RANCHO-

02:43:00.570 --> 02:43:01.938

CAN ALL THE- WITHIN THE- BY.

02:43:11.648 --> 02:43:12.182
TWENTY THIRTY. THEN- OVER THE

02:43:12.249 --> 02:43:14.518
LAST- COUPLE OF MONTHS- NO

YOU EXCELLENT IN THE

02:43:16.520 --> 02:43:17.621
DEVELOPMENT OF. SOME OF THE

02:43:17.687 --> 02:43:21.491
CRITICAL. INCLUDING BETTER- DO

02:43:21.558 --> 02:43:23.026
YOU A SIGNIFICANT- HAS COME

02:43:23.093 --> 02:43:25.695
THAT. THEY'RE GOING TO BE- IT

02:43:25.762 --> 02:43:27.164
SIX EIGHT AT THE END OF THE

02:43:27.230 --> 02:43:28.665
ENERGY AT SHARKS- OVER THE NEXT

02:43:28.732 --> 02:43:31.701
YEAR. HOBBIES ALL THESE I TO

CONVICT. HELLO BOOKS. SOME OF

02:43:35.906 --> 02:43:37.707
THE OUT OF THE TECHNOLOGY- IN

02:43:37.774 --> 02:43:39.910
THE MARKET MISS- BOTH INSIDE SO

02:43:39.976 --> 02:43:42.746
THAT WITHIN THERE YES. I'M NOT

02:43:42.812 --> 02:43:45.148
THOSE- AND TRY TO. YOU SHOULD

USE THE FIRST TWO SHE AND I OUR

02:43:47.083 --> 02:43:48.852
CENTERED ON- ONE DIRECTION

02:43:48.919 --> 02:43:51.821
STORAGE AND HYDROGEN STROKE SO

02:43:51.888 --> 02:43:53.890
LONG GREAT THE SHUT I THINK

02:43:53.957 --> 02:43:55.625
ENOUGH HAS AMBITIOUS TALK AT TO

02:43:55.692 --> 02:43:57.060
GET THE OVERALL CUTS SYSTEM

02:43:57.127 --> 02:43:58.862
COSTS BY NINETY PERCENT. OF

02:43:58.929 --> 02:44:02.766
ADULTS TEMPLES ALSO DIRECTION

02:44:02.832 --> 02:44:05.068
WITHIN A TICKET. AND THE- YEAH

02:44:05.135 --> 02:44:06.036
I THINK YOU'RE NOT LOOKING AT

02:44:06.102 --> 02:44:07.437
ADVANCING BECAUSE GETTING THE

02:44:07.504 --> 02:44:09.339
GOAL BUT FUNDING RESEARCH AND

02:44:09.406 --> 02:44:11.308
DEVELOPMENT NATIONAL LABS BUT

02:44:11.374 --> 02:44:12.542
STILL DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS

02:44:12.609 --> 02:44:14.844
DEPLOYMENTS AND- AND GETTING

02:44:14.911 --> 02:44:17.981
BEAT THAT THE MYSTIC MEDICATION

02:44:18.048 --> 02:44:18.481
INDUSTRY TO BRING THESE

02:44:18.548 --> 02:44:20.217
TECHNOLOGIES. THEN THE HEAD

02:44:20.283 --> 02:44:22.185
AGAIN HAVE CHART- IS- A VERY

02:44:22.252 --> 02:44:24.454
AMBITIOUS- TO CUT THE COST OF

02:44:24.521 --> 02:44:26.723
ITEMS- BY EIGHTY PERCENT- TO

02:44:26.790 --> 02:44:28.425
BRING HADN'T BILL ONE DOLLAR

02:44:28.491 --> 02:44:29.893
COLLAPSE I MEAN AT THAT POINT

02:44:29.960 --> 02:44:31.361
BUT ONE DOLLAR A KILOGRAM IT'S

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:32.062
BEEN A VERY COMPLICATED WITH

02:44:32.128 --> 02:44:33.730
NATURAL GAS. OR ANY OF THE

02:44:33.797 --> 02:44:37.667
OTHER- COME DISTRICTS- SO I

02:44:37.734 --> 02:44:39.336
THINK IMMA LOOKING AT THE HE'S

02:44:39.402 --> 02:44:42.772
BEEN. AT INITIATE MANY CAN SEE-

02:44:42.839 --> 02:44:45.408
THAT A- SIGNIFICANT FOCUS ON

02:44:45.475 --> 02:44:46.977
THINGS. I RECOMMENDATIONS

02:44:47.043 --> 02:44:48.778
STORAGE- IN THIS

02:44:48.845 --> 02:44:50.647
ADMINISTRATION. AND I THINK

02:44:50.714 --> 02:44:53.383
THERE ARE LOTS OF OPPORTUNITIES

02:44:53.450 --> 02:44:53.950
TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD VERY

02:44:54.017 --> 02:44:57.187
QUICKLY. WITH THAT I WILL STOP.

02:44:57.254 --> 02:44:59.656
TAKING PATIENTS. THANK YOU I'M

02:44:59.723 --> 02:45:02.659
THANK YOU SO IT'S VERY CLEAR

02:45:02.726 --> 02:45:06.429
THAT THE ISO EXCUSE ME THAT THE

02:45:06.496 --> 02:45:08.231
ARM. ENERGY COMMISSION FUNDS

02:45:08.298 --> 02:45:12.168
RESEARCH BUT NOT. NOT THE KIND

02:45:12.235 --> 02:45:13.703
OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS THAT

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:16.072
ARE NATIVE FOR SCALE UP TO WHAT

02:45:16.139 --> 02:45:18.308
EXTENT DO YOU THINK THE FEDERAL

02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:20.710
GOVERNMENT CAN BE PREPARED TO

02:45:20.777 --> 02:45:26.950
ARM. JOINTLY WORK WITH

02:45:27.017 --> 02:45:27.884
COMPANIES WHERE THEY'RE

02:45:27.951 --> 02:45:29.619
INVESTING THEIR MONEY AND THE

02:45:29.686 --> 02:45:31.154
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS CALLED

02:45:31.221 --> 02:45:33.790
BUYING DOWN THE COST OF

02:45:33.857 --> 02:45:35.558
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE PILOT

02:45:35.625 --> 02:45:37.160
PLANTS AND FRANKLY IN

02:45:37.227 --> 02:45:38.561
CALIFORNIA FROM WHAT I'VE JUST

02:45:38.628 --> 02:45:42.032
HEARD. OKAY NEED TO PRODUCE

02:45:42.098 --> 02:45:45.201
THIS IN LIKE FOR. FIFTY

02:45:45.268 --> 02:45:46.436
DEVELOPMENT TAKES ANOTHER

02:45:46.503 --> 02:45:47.304
COUPLE OF YEARS AND IT'S

02:45:47.370 --> 02:45:49.673
PROBABLY TAKES LONGER EIGHT WE

02:45:49.739 --> 02:45:50.273
HAVE LIKE FIVE YEARS TO DEPLOY

02:45:50.340 --> 02:45:54.577
IT- AT ANY RATE DO YOU SEE THE

02:45:54.644 --> 02:45:56.479
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GETTING

02:45:56.546 --> 02:45:59.916
INVOLVED. IN THESE LARGE SCALE

02:45:59.983 --> 02:46:02.719
INVESTMENTS. I THINK THAT WITH

02:46:02.786 --> 02:46:05.622
THE IDEALIZATION THAT THERE ARE

02:46:05.689 --> 02:46:07.023
TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE NEED TO

02:46:07.090 --> 02:46:08.558
THINK ABOUT WHAT CDS TOGETHER

02:46:08.625 --> 02:46:12.429
COUNTRY. AND AND- AND- BASED ON

02:46:12.495 --> 02:46:14.898
THE AND THE BABY NEW

02:46:14.964 --> 02:46:15.665
INITIATIVES AND PROGRAMS ARE

02:46:15.732 --> 02:46:18.968
BEING STRUCTURE. THAT IS A MUCH

02:46:19.035 --> 02:46:19.536
GREATER LEVEL OF ENGAGEMENT

02:46:19.602 --> 02:46:21.204
WITH INDUSTRY. THAT SAID I

02:46:21.271 --> 02:46:22.339
THINK IN ALL THESE A SLOWER

02:46:22.405 --> 02:46:24.941
PROCESS THIS. BUT THE POLICY

02:46:25.008 --> 02:46:26.976
AND- AND THE DIRECTION SEEMS TO

02:46:27.043 --> 02:46:29.379
BE- HOW DO WE ACTUALLY MOVE

02:46:29.446 --> 02:46:32.148
THINGS FORWARD BUT IT QUICKLY-

02:46:32.215 --> 02:46:32.682
WITH AND GET YOU THAT THIS

02:46:32.749 --> 02:46:35.819
INDUSTRY- ANOTHER THING I'LL

02:46:35.885 --> 02:46:37.721
BRING UP. AND YOU MAY OR MAY

02:46:37.787 --> 02:46:39.689
NOT BE AWARE OF THIS BUT- IN

02:46:39.756 --> 02:46:43.660
THE- WE MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE

02:46:43.727 --> 02:46:47.297
ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE MONEY.

02:46:47.364 --> 02:46:48.131
PASSED THROUGH THE SENATE

02:46:48.198 --> 02:46:49.199
THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE AND

02:46:49.265 --> 02:46:50.533
A HALF TRILLION DOLLARS AND

02:46:50.600 --> 02:46:51.701
THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE PLANNING

02:46:51.768 --> 02:46:53.470
TO DO MOST OF THE MONEY THAT

02:46:53.536 --> 02:46:54.738
WOULD BUILD ADDITIONAL

02:46:54.804 --> 02:46:56.773
RENEWABLE RESOURCES. UP FOR

02:46:56.840 --> 02:46:59.676
LARGE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY-

02:46:59.743 --> 02:47:01.778
THEY DON'T HAVE THE KIND OF.

02:47:01.845 --> 02:47:03.346
DEPLOYMENT THAT WE DO ALREADY

02:47:03.413 --> 02:47:05.982
IN CALIFORNIA. SO FOR THEM

02:47:06.049 --> 02:47:07.517
STORAGE MAY NOT BE IS IMPORTANT

02:47:07.584 --> 02:47:09.686
BUT HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT

02:47:09.753 --> 02:47:10.253
STORAGE IS GOING TO BE VERY

02:47:10.320 --> 02:47:12.689
IMPORTANT. DO WE KNOW IF THERE

02:47:12.756 --> 02:47:14.391
ARE THOUGHT TO CONGRESS ABOUT

02:47:14.457 --> 02:47:17.794
NOT ONLY- PAYING FOR

02:47:17.861 --> 02:47:19.229
DEVELOPMENT OF MORE RENEWABLE

02:47:19.295 --> 02:47:21.598
RESOURCES BUT ALSO STORAGE JUST

02:47:21.664 --> 02:47:24.267
BUYING STORAGE AS THEY WOULD

02:47:24.334 --> 02:47:30.407
BUY- RENEWABLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:47:30.473 --> 02:47:31.708
I DON'T KNOW BUT BUT THE FACT

02:47:31.775 --> 02:47:33.076
THAT WE HAVE IN THE OFFICE OF

02:47:33.143 --> 02:47:35.044
BOOKING OF THE TECHNOLOGIES AND

02:47:35.111 --> 02:47:36.346
THE THAT IS A IT'S A IT'S A BIG

02:47:36.413 --> 02:47:38.047
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FOCUS ON

02:47:38.114 --> 02:47:40.417
NON. DEMONSTRATIONS OF ENERGY

02:47:40.483 --> 02:47:43.353
STORAGE- IN THE IN THE BUDGET

02:47:43.420 --> 02:47:45.755
IS. I THINK THEY COULD BE GOOD

02:47:45.822 --> 02:47:46.856
OPTIONS BUT ALL THE STATE'S

02:47:46.923 --> 02:47:50.660
BUDGET SCRIPT UNNECESSARILY-

02:47:50.727 --> 02:47:51.795
CALIFORNIA NEW YORK. ALL RIGHT

02:47:51.861 --> 02:47:58.968
VERY GOOD- SO- MISTER BRADLEY

02:47:59.035 --> 02:48:01.070
WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT A

02:48:01.137 --> 02:48:02.872
LITTLE BIT MORE ON ON HOW YOU

02:48:02.939 --> 02:48:05.975
SEE- YOU'RE YOU'RE INVESTING

02:48:06.042 --> 02:48:08.211
NOW IN A LOT OF R. AND D. HOW

02:48:08.278 --> 02:48:09.946
YOU SEE DEPLOYMENT OF SOME OF

02:48:10.013 --> 02:48:12.649
THESE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE

02:48:12.715 --> 02:48:14.350
HEARD THREE DIFFERENT ONE FROM

02:48:14.417 --> 02:48:16.886
DOCTOR KURTZ WE'VE HEARD ABOUT

02:48:16.953 --> 02:48:19.823
THE IRON- AIR BATTERY WE'VE

02:48:19.889 --> 02:48:23.026
TALKED ABOUT HYDROGEN. WITH THE

02:48:23.092 --> 02:48:25.328
ENERGY COMMISSION BE INVOLVED

02:48:25.395 --> 02:48:29.966
IN- SAY TRYING TO HELP. AT

02:48:30.033 --> 02:48:31.534
LEAST COME UP WITH POLICY FOR

02:48:31.601 --> 02:48:34.237
HOW WE DEVELOP- THE PILOT

02:48:34.304 --> 02:48:36.673
PLANTS AND A SHOW THE

02:48:36.739 --> 02:48:40.510
FEASIBILITY OF THE SOME STORAGE

02:48:40.577 --> 02:48:44.647
TECHNOLOGIES. IN LARGE SCALE.

02:48:44.714 --> 02:48:46.316
IT CERTAINLY I BELIEVE THAT'S A

02:48:46.382 --> 02:48:47.584
KEY ELEMENT FOR WHAT WE'RE

02:48:47.650 --> 02:48:48.952
DOING I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT

02:48:49.018 --> 02:48:51.788
THAT- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT-

02:48:51.855 --> 02:48:53.556
VERY IMPORTANT TO THINK ABOUT

02:48:53.623 --> 02:48:54.891
YOU'VE MENTIONED THIS THIS

02:48:54.958 --> 02:48:56.659
LARGE STORAGE NEEDS AND SPACE

02:48:56.726 --> 02:48:57.927
SEASONAL COURSES OR OTHER

02:48:57.994 --> 02:49:00.430
SHORTER DURATION STORAGE BUT

02:49:00.497 --> 02:49:01.364
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE

02:49:01.431 --> 02:49:03.633
IN A GROWING BE FORCED

02:49:03.700 --> 02:49:04.467
COMPANIES JUST TO GET THE

02:49:04.534 --> 02:49:05.702
INVESTMENT COMMUNITIES

02:49:05.768 --> 02:49:07.270
INTERESTED ENOUGH TO SEE THE

02:49:07.337 --> 02:49:09.239
VALUE. THERE IS PROBABLY A

02:49:09.305 --> 02:49:10.673
THIRD OF THE STATE'S IN UNITED

02:49:10.740 --> 02:49:12.509
STATES AND HAVE SIMILAR GOALS

02:49:12.575 --> 02:49:15.144
OF CALIFORNIA FOR ZERO CARBON-

02:49:15.211 --> 02:49:18.314
INFRASTRUCTURE BY TWENTY FOUR

02:49:18.381 --> 02:49:18.915
TWENTY FIFTEEN SO THERE IS AN

02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:20.016
OPPORTUNITY TO GROW CALIFORNIA

02:49:20.083 --> 02:49:21.684
HAS IT SO ONE OF THE THINGS

02:49:21.751 --> 02:49:23.553
IT'S TO PERFORMANCE AND THE

02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:26.155
VALUE SO IT IS JUST SOMETHING

02:49:26.222 --> 02:49:27.190
THE STATE'S GOING TO PAY FOR

02:49:27.257 --> 02:49:28.992
AND YOU HAVE TO GO DEMONSTRATE

02:49:29.058 --> 02:49:29.859
VERY ONE THING BUT WHAT WE

02:49:29.926 --> 02:49:31.594
TRYING DEMONSTRATED FACT THAT

02:49:31.661 --> 02:49:32.662
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA

02:49:32.729 --> 02:49:34.230
PAY FOR ITSELF AND HAVE A

02:49:34.297 --> 02:49:36.299
COMMERCIAL OPPORTUNITY. I WOULD

02:49:36.366 --> 02:49:37.333
USE YOUR FOR EXAMPLE YOU

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:38.668
MENTIONED THE FOR MANAGING

02:49:38.735 --> 02:49:39.869
THEIR SEVERAL COPIES WERE DOING

02:49:39.936 --> 02:49:40.870
THAT LOOKING AT A HUNDRED HOURS

02:49:40.937 --> 02:49:42.105
OF STORAGE BUT ONE OF THE

02:49:42.171 --> 02:49:44.173
CONCEPT IS FOR THOSE TYPES OF

02:49:44.240 --> 02:49:45.708
HUNDRED OUR STORAGE SYSTEMS IS

02:49:45.775 --> 02:49:47.010
THEY WOULD OPERATE EVERY DAY

02:49:47.076 --> 02:49:48.845
CAN BE SELLING ENERGY IN THE

02:49:48.912 --> 02:49:50.380
MARKET PLACE TO BE I CHAU TELL

02:49:50.446 --> 02:49:52.482
UTILITIES TENNESSEE CH EVERY

02:49:52.549 --> 02:49:54.751
DAY IN ADDITION TO HAVING. A

02:49:54.817 --> 02:49:56.653
FEW DAYS OR A WEEK A CONTINUAL

02:49:56.719 --> 02:49:58.421
STORAGE WITH THEM SO THEY'RE

02:49:58.488 --> 02:49:59.722
MAKING MONEY ON THEIR PAY

02:49:59.789 --> 02:50:01.491
YOUNGER OVER HERE THEIR PAIN OR

02:50:01.558 --> 02:50:02.725
EXPENSES ON A DAILY BASIS BUT

02:50:02.792 --> 02:50:03.993
THEN THEY ALSO HAVE THE ABILITY

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:06.029
TO BRINGING ONE THIS ONE IS

02:50:06.095 --> 02:50:06.930
REALLY NEEDED THESE LONGER

02:50:06.996 --> 02:50:08.731
DURATIONS SO I DO THINK ONE OF

02:50:08.798 --> 02:50:10.700
THE CHALLENGES WERE FACING AND

02:50:10.767 --> 02:50:12.669
IS TO CONVINCE THE INVESTMENT

02:50:12.735 --> 02:50:13.536
COMMITTED BECAUSE ONE OF THE

02:50:13.603 --> 02:50:14.837
BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE RUN INTO

02:50:14.904 --> 02:50:16.105
WHEN YOU SAY WE WANT TO SCALE

02:50:16.172 --> 02:50:17.740
UP THE SAME VIDEO PROJECT OF A

02:50:17.807 --> 02:50:18.708
HUNDRED KILOWATTS WE WANT TO GO

02:50:18.775 --> 02:50:19.742
TO ONE MEGAWATT- FIVE

02:50:19.809 --> 02:50:21.744
MEGAWATTS. FOR THAT COMPANY TO

02:50:21.811 --> 02:50:23.112
BE ABLE TO DO THAT THEY NEED IN

02:50:23.179 --> 02:50:25.148
MOST CASES IN CALIFORNIA AND

02:50:25.214 --> 02:50:27.383
ELSEWHERE THE UTILITY OR THE

02:50:27.450 --> 02:50:28.651
CUSTOMER WOULD LIKE TO DO A

02:50:28.718 --> 02:50:30.019
POWER PURCHASE AGREEMENT A LONG

02:50:30.086 --> 02:50:32.188
TERM AGREEMENT SIX TEN FIFTEEN

02:50:32.255 --> 02:50:33.957
TWENTY YEARS AND SO THEY HAVE

02:50:34.023 --> 02:50:35.358
TO BE AN INVESTMENT A

02:50:35.425 --> 02:50:37.393
CAPABILITY THAT WILL DO THAT

02:50:37.460 --> 02:50:38.761
AND SO THE WORK THAT WE DO IS

02:50:38.828 --> 02:50:40.363
TRYING TO PROVE TO THAT

02:50:40.430 --> 02:50:41.531
COMMUNITY THAT THIS TECHNOLOGY

02:50:41.598 --> 02:50:50.907
IS REAL. THE COMPANY IS REAL

02:50:50.974 --> 02:50:52.141
THE TO TECHNOLOGY WORK AND IT'S

02:50:52.208 --> 02:50:53.676
TO. UP THANK YOU YOUR CALL.

02:50:53.743 --> 02:50:54.477
WHEN YOU AT THE PARK.

02:50:54.544 --> 02:50:56.713
CALIFORNIA THE- ARE COUNTRY.

02:50:56.779 --> 02:50:58.281
THERE IS A RAY. GROW OF MANAGED.

02:50:58.348 --> 02:50:59.582
BUT IT'S TO END UP NEEDING CUT

02:50:59.649 --> 02:51:01.217
THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY NEEDS ON.

02:51:01.284 --> 02:51:02.919
HOW THOSE PROBLEMS ACROSS BASIS.

02:51:02.986 --> 02:51:04.187
CAN ACTUALLY OF PAY THEM SO

02:51:04.253 --> 02:51:05.955
WITH THE- THEY PROVIDING. TO

02:51:06.022 --> 02:51:07.757
THE UTILITY TOOK AGREE. AND TO

02:51:07.824 --> 02:51:13.663
THE STATE- THEY ARE DIFFERENT.

02:51:13.730 --> 02:51:14.998
THAT I SEE. ARE FOR THIS

02:51:15.064 --> 02:51:17.166
SEASONAL. STORAGE IF WE GO TO.

02:51:17.233 --> 02:51:22.171
A WHAT WAS BROUGHT UP BY- DR

02:51:22.238 --> 02:51:25.441
BURGER. THERE IS GOING TO BE A

02:51:25.508 --> 02:51:28.144
YEAR OUT THERE. WHERE WE'RE

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:29.912
GONNA NEED A HUNDRED HOURS OF

02:51:29.979 --> 02:51:32.215
STORAGE OR SOMETHING LIKE A

02:51:32.281 --> 02:51:34.651
HUNDRED HOURS OF- TO REDUCE

02:51:34.717 --> 02:51:37.120
POWER ON THE ORDER OF TWENTY

02:51:37.186 --> 02:51:39.355
GIGA WATCH FOR HUNDRED HOURS.

02:51:39.422 --> 02:51:41.324
MAYBE ONCE EVERY THIRTY YEARS

02:51:41.391 --> 02:51:44.260
BUT YOU CAN'T AFFORD. NOT TO

02:51:44.327 --> 02:51:45.762
HAVE THAT HUNDRED HOURS IN

02:51:45.828 --> 02:51:48.965
RESERVE. BUT ORDINARILY YOU'RE

02:51:49.032 --> 02:51:51.634
ONLY GONNA NEED. MAYBE FIVE

02:51:51.701 --> 02:51:55.038
HOURS OR TEN HOURS AT MOST

02:51:55.104 --> 02:51:56.639
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO NEED A

02:51:56.706 --> 02:51:58.241
HUNDRED UP ONCE EVERY TEN YEARS

02:51:58.307 --> 02:52:00.043
I THINK HE SAID SOMETHING LIKE

02:52:00.109 --> 02:52:02.178
IT'S FIFTY HOURS AND YOU KNOW

02:52:02.245 --> 02:52:05.081
THEY SELL ONE CASE WERE WITH A

02:52:05.148 --> 02:52:05.682
HUNDRED DOWN FOR THIRTY YEARS

02:52:05.748 --> 02:52:07.684
WORTH OF DATA. SO YOU'VE GOT

02:52:07.750 --> 02:52:12.188
STORAGE THAT IS GOD SOMEHOW OR

02:52:12.255 --> 02:52:14.691
ANOTHER A HUNDRED HOURS WORTH

02:52:14.757 --> 02:52:17.360
OF STORAGE BUT ON A DAILY BASIS

02:52:17.427 --> 02:52:18.928
YOU'RE ONLY USING ABOUT FIVE

02:52:18.995 --> 02:52:22.465
HOURS. THE ECONOMICS OF THIS

02:52:22.532 --> 02:52:25.735
ARE NOT GOOD- WE HEARD FROM DR

02:52:25.802 --> 02:52:27.136
KIRCH TALKING ABOUT THE

02:52:27.203 --> 02:52:30.039
STRATEGIC PETROLEUM RESERVE

02:52:30.106 --> 02:52:32.809
WHICH YOU HAVE FOR EMERGENCIES.

02:52:32.875 --> 02:52:33.509
IT'S NOT GOING TO EVER PAY FOR

02:52:33.576 --> 02:52:35.912
ITSELF A HUNDRED HOURS WORTH OF

02:52:35.978 --> 02:52:38.414
STORAGE WHEN YOU'RE USING FIVE

02:52:38.481 --> 02:52:41.617
OR IF MOST CHEN. ON A DAILY

02:52:41.684 --> 02:52:44.420
BASIS IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO

02:52:44.487 --> 02:52:48.357
PAY FOR ITSELF SO I THINK. WELL

02:52:48.424 --> 02:52:49.892
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE PAID FOR BY

02:52:49.959 --> 02:52:51.661
RATE PAYERS OR SOME OTHER

02:52:51.728 --> 02:52:54.330
INVESTMENT BUT IT'S NOT GOING

02:52:54.397 --> 02:52:55.631
TO BE I THINK COMMERCIALLY

02:52:55.698 --> 02:52:58.468
SOMETHING. WELL IN THE END

02:52:58.534 --> 02:53:00.002
REPAIRS TO PAY FOR ALL THE

02:53:00.069 --> 02:53:01.671
ELECTRICITY THE POINT IS THAT

02:53:01.738 --> 02:53:03.473
THIS IS A HUGE AMOUNT OF

02:53:03.539 --> 02:53:06.476
STORAGE THAT YOU'RE PAYING FOR

02:53:06.542 --> 02:53:09.512
AND VERY SELDOM GET TO USE. SO

02:53:09.579 --> 02:53:11.581
YOU KNOW THE COSTS ARE HIGH.

02:53:11.647 --> 02:53:14.117
YOU'RE NOT GETTING THAT DAILY-

02:53:14.183 --> 02:53:18.020
REVENUE. AND IT MEANS THE COST

02:53:18.087 --> 02:53:18.621
OF ELECTRICITY IS GOING TO BE

02:53:18.688 --> 02:53:22.558
QUITE HIGH. THAT IS THE

02:53:22.625 --> 02:53:23.693
QUESTION THAT I WILL POINT OUT

02:53:23.760 --> 02:53:24.794
YOU MENTIONED EARLIER ABOUT BUT

02:53:24.861 --> 02:53:26.863
BOTH DR COURAGE AND ARE WITH

02:53:26.929 --> 02:53:28.164
BIGGER FROM FOR FOUR MINUTES

02:53:28.231 --> 02:53:29.332
YOU HAVE THE TWO DIFFERENT

02:53:29.398 --> 02:53:30.299
GRANTS WE HAVE WHAT WE'RE

02:53:30.366 --> 02:53:32.068
LOOKING AT THE WHOLE QUESTION.

02:53:32.135 --> 02:53:33.136
OF LONG DURATION SEASONAL

02:53:33.202 --> 02:53:34.637
STORAGE AND WHAT THE ROLE IS IN

02:53:34.704 --> 02:53:37.640
CALIFORNIA NOW IF IT'S JUST BE

02:53:37.707 --> 02:53:38.241
ONE HUNDRED. SO IT IS A TOUGH

02:53:38.307 --> 02:53:40.243
QUESTION. IT IS AN AREA WHERE

02:53:40.309 --> 02:53:41.110
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE

02:53:41.177 --> 02:53:42.979
SYSTEM IN OTHER WORDS OF MAYBE

02:53:43.045 --> 02:53:44.647
JUST EMERGING STORAGE BY ITSELF

02:53:44.714 --> 02:53:46.783
IS NOT THE ONLY SOLUTION. WE

02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:49.185
TALKED ABOUT LOOK VEHICLES AND-

02:53:49.252 --> 02:53:50.186
THE DOCTOR CHRIS MENTIONED YOU

02:53:50.253 --> 02:53:51.821
KNOW HOW TO TURN THE TRUCKS

02:53:51.888 --> 02:53:53.790
BEING ABLE TO BE A GREAT ASSET.

02:53:53.856 --> 02:53:55.525
CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST EFFORTS

02:53:55.591 --> 02:53:56.759
PERCENT LOOK AT VEHICLES IN THE

02:53:56.826 --> 02:53:58.394
COUNTRY IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A

02:53:58.461 --> 02:53:59.395
LARGE ROADS WE CAN VERY VOCAL

02:53:59.462 --> 02:54:01.631
HAVE. THEM AS AN ASSET IT FOR

02:54:01.697 --> 02:54:03.166
THOSE TYPES OF THINGS SO I

02:54:03.232 --> 02:54:04.200
THINK IT DEMAND RESPONSE IS A

02:54:04.267 --> 02:54:06.035
BIG EFFORT IN CALIFORNIA TROOPS

02:54:06.102 --> 02:54:08.638
AND LOAD MANAGEMENT SO I THINK.

02:54:08.704 --> 02:54:09.972
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE SOLUTION

02:54:10.039 --> 02:54:12.275
AND I AGREE WITH YOU ONE PERSON

02:54:12.341 --> 02:54:13.509
ONE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE

02:54:13.576 --> 02:54:14.677
AND WON THE CHALLENGES WE WANT

02:54:14.744 --> 02:54:15.678
TO FIGURE OUT IS HOW DO WE

02:54:15.745 --> 02:54:17.346
ADDRESS JUST. FOR YOUR CORRECT

02:54:17.413 --> 02:54:18.948
CALIFORNIA IS NOT THE TOP ONE

02:54:19.015 --> 02:54:19.882
TO SAY OKAY WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

02:54:19.949 --> 02:54:21.751
POWER YOU KNOW- BUT TWICE A

02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:23.219
YEAR YOU CAN EXPECT TO LOSE

02:54:23.286 --> 02:54:24.320
EVERYTHING I HAVE TALKED ON THE

02:54:24.387 --> 02:54:25.955
WORK WE HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION

02:54:26.022 --> 02:54:27.490
FOR EVERYTHING. AND SO I THINK

02:54:27.557 --> 02:54:28.558
WE JUST NEED TO LOOK AT IT ONE

02:54:28.624 --> 02:54:29.659
OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE HOPING

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:31.460
TO DO IS TO DO THAT BALANCED

02:54:31.527 --> 02:54:33.429
APPROACH AND TO LOOK AT THE

02:54:33.496 --> 02:54:34.263
DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS TO

02:54:34.330 --> 02:54:35.965
DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES. ONE OF

02:54:36.032 --> 02:54:36.966
THE INTERESTING THINGS I CAN

02:54:37.033 --> 02:54:38.401
SHARE YOU KNOW WITH THE GRANTS

02:54:38.467 --> 02:54:40.002
THAT WE ARE HAVING AT THE END

02:54:40.069 --> 02:54:42.271
OF. ESTIMATED COST THAT THE

02:54:42.338 --> 02:54:43.840
GREAT TO USE REQUESTED MEETING

02:54:43.906 --> 02:54:45.341
IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN IF

02:54:45.408 --> 02:54:46.609
YOU MY INTEREST IN THE FORTY

02:54:46.676 --> 02:54:48.244
WILL MAKE COMPETE AND FUTURE

02:54:48.311 --> 02:54:49.779
AND HAVE A SPREADER SOLUTION IN

02:54:49.846 --> 02:54:51.380
THIS PLACE STATE COULD BE

02:54:51.447 --> 02:54:53.449
PAYING SUBSTANTIALLY LESS. THAN

02:54:53.516 --> 02:54:55.384
DEMOCRATIC TODAY SO YOU KNOW

02:54:55.451 --> 02:54:56.452
THE ONE THING THAT LITHIUM ION

02:54:56.519 --> 02:54:59.155
DOES FOR THE MARKET PLACE I'VE

02:54:59.222 --> 02:55:00.723
BEEN IN AS LONG AS I HAVE. IS A

02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:01.524
SENSE OF PRICE POINT IN THE

02:55:01.591 --> 02:55:02.792
PERFORMANCE POINT THAT

02:55:02.859 --> 02:55:04.327
EVERYBODY HAS TO BE ARE-

02:55:04.393 --> 02:55:05.361
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

02:55:05.428 --> 02:55:06.596
COMPETE IN THE COMMERCIAL

02:55:06.662 --> 02:55:07.897
MARKET CHOI DOES GIVE US THAT

02:55:07.964 --> 02:55:09.398
BUT I DO THINK YOU YOU HAVE

02:55:09.465 --> 02:55:11.868
DEFINITELY HIT. AN AREA WHERE

02:55:11.934 --> 02:55:13.903
THERE'S A CLEAR NEED. I DON'T

02:55:13.970 --> 02:55:15.504
THINK IT'S TOMORROW BUT YOU'RE

02:55:15.571 --> 02:55:17.673
CORRECT TWENTY THIRTY TWENTY

02:55:17.740 --> 02:55:18.241
FORTY OF MADE UP WE THINK WE

02:55:18.307 --> 02:55:28.451
CAN MAYBE CAN'T. WAIT TO TWENTY

02:55:28.517 --> 02:55:29.051
FORTY FIVE. BUT I DO THEY- WE

02:55:29.118 --> 02:55:29.685
HAVE TO LOOK AT THE UP. AND I

02:55:29.752 --> 02:55:31.854
DO. SOME OF THE- EMERGING. THAT

02:55:31.921 --> 02:55:33.556
WE HAVE HAVE A LOT. I THINK

02:55:33.623 --> 02:55:35.458
STATE TIGER THE MORE POPULAR.

02:55:35.524 --> 02:55:37.226
TECHNOLOGY IN THE- MOST OF

02:55:37.293 --> 02:55:37.927
PROGRAM TECHNOLOGY IN THE WORLD.

02:55:37.994 --> 02:55:39.795
IN IT HAS A ROLE TO PLAY IN THE

02:55:39.862 --> 02:55:41.364
JUST LIKE EVERY OTHER TO. DOES

02:55:41.430 --> 02:55:42.064
REAL QUESTIONS NO TO BE YOU

02:55:42.131 --> 02:55:43.966
KNOW WHAT CAN WE LIVE WITH ON A

02:55:44.033 --> 02:55:45.167
COMPOUND HE KAMALA BASIS AS WE

02:55:45.234 --> 02:55:47.603
GROW DISTRICT. AND HELD A WEEK

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:49.272
JUST TO FIVE. THE COST THAT

02:55:49.338 --> 02:55:50.840
WE'RE PAYING IN THE SERVICE FOR

02:55:50.907 --> 02:55:52.475
GETTING AND SO THAT'S AN AREA

02:55:52.541 --> 02:55:53.943
THAT WE SPEND A LOT OF TIME ON

02:55:54.010 --> 02:55:55.645
IN OUR RESEARCH IS JUST TRYING

02:55:55.711 --> 02:55:57.380
TO MAKE THAT TRADE OFF. BETWEEN

02:55:57.446 --> 02:56:00.216
WHAT IS THE PERFORMANCE WE NEED

02:56:00.283 --> 02:56:01.817
AND WHERE ARE WE WILLING TO PAY

02:56:01.884 --> 02:56:03.152
FOR IT AND HOW CAN WE DO THAT

02:56:03.219 --> 02:56:04.487
IN A MANNER WHERE WE INTEGRATE

02:56:04.553 --> 02:56:06.222
DRINKS. AND PAY LESS MAYBE A

02:56:06.289 --> 02:56:07.490
HALF OR A THIRD OF WHAT IT

02:56:07.556 --> 02:56:09.058
MIGHT BE IF WE DIDN'T INTEGRATE

02:56:09.125 --> 02:56:10.860
THOSE DIFFERENT CONNECTIONS

02:56:10.927 --> 02:56:15.798
TOGETHER YES. I'M NUMBER CLERK.

02:56:15.865 --> 02:56:16.799
I'M GONNA MAKE MY- AND I I'D

02:56:16.866 --> 02:56:19.602
LOVE TO HEAR. IS THAT WAS-

02:56:19.669 --> 02:56:21.771
TALKING ABOUT PUMPED HYDRO. IN

02:56:21.837 --> 02:56:23.239
THE WHOLE COUNTRY WE'RE TALKING

02:56:23.306 --> 02:56:25.474
ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

02:56:25.541 --> 02:56:26.976
THOUSAND MEGAWATT HOURS OF

02:56:27.043 --> 02:56:29.178
STORAGE. THAT'S FROM A

02:56:29.245 --> 02:56:31.113
WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE IT'S PROBABLY

02:56:31.180 --> 02:56:32.882
RIGHT TO WITHIN A FACTOR OF TWO

02:56:32.949 --> 02:56:34.750
OR SO. NOT SURE HOW MUCH THE

02:56:34.817 --> 02:56:36.085
REASON CALIFORNIA BUT IT'S

02:56:36.152 --> 02:56:39.355
PROBABLY ON THE ORDER

02:56:39.422 --> 02:56:41.490
250-005-0000 MEGAWATT HOURS. IT

02:56:41.557 --> 02:56:42.992
THAT'S A FAIR AMOUNT AND IT'S

02:56:43.059 --> 02:56:44.860
MORE THAN BATTERIES OR ANYTHING

02:56:44.927 --> 02:56:47.396
ELSE BUT- AGAIN FOR SEASONAL

02:56:47.463 --> 02:56:48.531
STORAGE WE'RE GOING TO NEED

02:56:48.597 --> 02:56:51.200
BILLIONS. A MEGAWATT HOURS I

02:56:51.267 --> 02:56:53.669
DON'T HAVE AN EXACT NUMBER BUT

02:56:53.736 --> 02:56:54.236
JUST TALKING TO THE EXPERTS

02:56:54.303 --> 02:56:56.839
HERE TODAY. YOU KNOW WITH. THIS

02:56:56.906 --> 02:57:02.611
SORT OF SMALL- HOW CAN I SAY

02:57:02.678 --> 02:57:05.214
JUST BACK OF THE ENVELOPE

02:57:05.281 --> 02:57:05.715
CALCULATIONS IT COMES TO

02:57:05.781 --> 02:57:09.618
MILLIONS. IF WE HAVE TWENTY

02:57:09.685 --> 02:57:10.219
FIVE OR FIFTY THOUSAND HERE IN

02:57:10.286 --> 02:57:13.756
CALIFORNIA. OF THAT AND IT TO

02:57:13.823 --> 02:57:16.959
SCALE UP. TO GO FROM TO TWENTY

02:57:17.026 --> 02:57:18.260
FIVE OR FIFTY THOUSAND TWO

02:57:18.327 --> 02:57:20.863
MILLION IS JUST HUGE AND IT

02:57:20.930 --> 02:57:23.132
TAKES A LONG TIME AT LEAST TEN

02:57:23.199 --> 02:57:25.334
YEARS TO. BUILD ONE OF THESE

02:57:25.401 --> 02:57:26.736
PROJECTS PROBABLY ANOTHER TEN

02:57:26.802 --> 02:57:30.573
YEARS TO GET IT PERMITTED. SO

02:57:30.639 --> 02:57:33.542
IT'S A TOUGH PROBLEM I THINK

02:57:33.609 --> 02:57:35.211
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE AND- HOW

02:57:35.277 --> 02:57:37.113
CAN WE DEPLOY THIS QUICKLY

02:57:37.179 --> 02:57:39.148
ENOUGH TO MATTER HOW CAN WE

02:57:39.215 --> 02:57:47.089
MAKE SURE AS DR RAM. FROM- A

02:57:47.156 --> 02:57:48.657
LARGE BERKELEY SAID IT IT TAKES

02:57:48.724 --> 02:57:49.892
A LONG TIME TO DEVELOP THE

02:57:49.959 --> 02:57:51.660
TECHNOLOGIES AND LONGER STILL

02:57:51.727 --> 02:57:54.430
TO DEPLOY THEM SO WE ARE IN AN

02:57:54.497 --> 02:57:55.731
EMERGENCY HERE I THINK THAT'S

02:57:55.798 --> 02:57:57.566
THE BOTTOM LINE IF THIS WHOLE

02:57:57.633 --> 02:58:02.138
HEARING. OKAY WHO WHAT WHAT IS

02:58:02.204 --> 02:58:03.472
GOING ON OR SAYING ONE THING GO

02:58:03.539 --> 02:58:04.774
AHEAD I JUST CALLED ONE HUNDRED

02:58:04.840 --> 02:58:06.742
THINGS ARE GONNA GET WE DO HAVE

02:58:06.809 --> 02:58:07.543
A TEN YEAR HISTORY. OF WORKING

02:58:07.610 --> 02:58:09.311
ON ALL TECHNOLOGIES IN RECENTLY

02:58:09.378 --> 02:58:10.279
WE WERE GOING THROUGH JUST A

02:58:10.346 --> 02:58:10.980
TERM WHO COULD HELP US WITH

02:58:11.047 --> 02:58:12.114
SOME OF THE HEAT RANGE AND WE

02:58:12.181 --> 02:58:14.116
HAVE BABY. THIRTY TECHNOLOGIES

02:58:14.183 --> 02:58:15.217
THAT ARE DIFFERENT THAT WE WORK

02:58:15.284 --> 02:58:16.819
WITH AND IT'S PROBABLY EIGHT TO

02:58:16.886 --> 02:58:17.386
TEN OF THEM HAVE GOT TO THE

02:58:17.453 --> 02:58:18.821
POINT WHERE THEY'RE READY FOR

02:58:18.888 --> 02:58:20.756
RAPID SCALE UP AND SO THERE AND

02:58:20.823 --> 02:58:21.857
THERE'S ANOTHER TWO OR THREE TO

02:58:21.924 --> 02:58:23.926
BEAT. JEFF WAITED TILL LATER SO

02:58:23.993 --> 02:58:26.228
WE DO HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF

02:58:26.295 --> 02:58:27.430
WORKING THIS CHALLENGE AND WE

02:58:27.496 --> 02:58:29.565
DO HAVE OPTIONS AND AGAIN

02:58:29.632 --> 02:58:31.200
EVERYBODY YOU RECALL TODAY.

02:58:31.267 --> 02:58:32.735
MOST OF WHAT HAPPENED AT THE

02:58:32.802 --> 02:58:33.369
GRANT SOMEWHERE IN THEIR

02:58:33.436 --> 02:58:35.171
HISTORY. AND SO WE'RE FORTUNATE

02:58:35.237 --> 02:58:36.639
TO DO THAT BUT I DO THINK YOU

02:58:36.705 --> 02:58:38.074
KNOW AS WE GO FORWARD YOU KNOW

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:39.275
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO

02:58:39.341 --> 02:58:40.810
LEVERAGE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED AND

02:58:40.876 --> 02:58:42.278
TAKE SOME RISKS WITH SOME OF

02:58:42.344 --> 02:58:43.379
THE COMPANIES THAT WE THINK ARE

02:58:43.446 --> 02:58:45.147
READY. BECAUSE I WOULD AGREE WE

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:46.849
CANNOT GET THIS ON A HUNDRED

02:58:46.916 --> 02:58:48.317
KILOWATTS OF THE TIMER ONE

02:58:48.384 --> 02:58:49.885
MEGAWATT WEEK WE DO TEND TO

02:58:49.952 --> 02:58:51.287
MAKE A WATCHING WE NEED. TO

02:58:51.353 --> 02:58:52.455
ENSURE WE GET TOGETHER TODAY

02:58:52.521 --> 02:58:53.989
HERE KEEP SENATE BABY THOUSAND

02:58:54.056 --> 02:58:55.891
MEGAWATT HOURS WE NEED. TO BE

02:58:55.958 --> 02:58:57.193
ABLE TO DO THIS AND WE JUST GOT

02:58:57.259 --> 02:58:59.028
TO FIND THE RIGHT WAY TO DO IT

02:58:59.095 --> 02:59:00.629
SO THAT WE CAN MEET OUR NEEDS

02:59:00.696 --> 02:59:02.364
AND- IN AN ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT

02:59:02.431 --> 02:59:03.933
AND WE DON'T HAVE THIS BIG.

02:59:03.999 --> 02:59:05.601
COST THAT WE'RE PUTTING OUT

02:59:05.668 --> 02:59:07.169
THERE PERCENT BEEN RESTORED

02:59:07.236 --> 02:59:08.671
ONCE IN THE SUMMER OVER THREE

02:59:08.737 --> 02:59:10.272
MONTHS YOU MAY USE IT FOR TEN

02:59:10.339 --> 02:59:11.540
DAYS IN THE WINTER WE DON'T USE

02:59:11.607 --> 02:59:13.275
IT THE NEXT YEAR. BUT WE HAVE

02:59:13.342 --> 02:59:14.777
TO FIND A WAY TO MEET THOSE

02:59:14.844 --> 02:59:16.245
NEEDS AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:59:16.312 --> 02:59:17.813
OF WHAT CHOICES THAT WE HAVE.

02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:19.148
AND THAT'S A PROMISING START OR

02:59:19.215 --> 02:59:20.816
DO YOU THINK I MEAN I'VE BEEN

02:59:20.883 --> 02:59:22.118
INVOLVED THIS A LONG TIME I SEE

02:59:22.184 --> 02:59:23.853
MORE PROMISED MORE OPPORTUNITY

02:59:23.919 --> 02:59:25.521
AND MORE INVESTMENT. IN STORAGE

02:59:25.588 --> 02:59:27.022
NOW OPEN AND PROBABLY THE

02:59:27.089 --> 02:59:28.357
PREVIOUS TWENTY FIVE YEARS THAT

02:59:28.424 --> 02:59:29.959
I WAS IN THE INDUSTRY. SO I

02:59:30.025 --> 02:59:30.993
JUST THINK THERE'S A LOT OF

02:59:31.060 --> 02:59:32.528
HOPE BUT I DO THINK YOU'RE

02:59:32.595 --> 02:59:33.896
ASKING SOME TOUGH QUESTIONS-

02:59:33.963 --> 02:59:34.797
WE'RE GOING UP TO THINK ABOUT

02:59:34.864 --> 02:59:35.898
YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO INTEGRATE

02:59:35.965 --> 02:59:36.799
YOUR AND YOUR POLICY REPORT AT

02:59:36.866 --> 02:59:38.434
THE COMMISSION. THIS MAY BE A

02:59:38.501 --> 02:59:39.869
QUESTION DETECTING SHOULD LOOK

02:59:39.935 --> 02:59:42.004
AT AND ONE OF OUR FUTURE GREAT

02:59:42.071 --> 02:59:43.639
POST REPORTS JUST HOW DO WE

02:59:43.706 --> 02:59:44.740
ADDRESS THIS LONG TERM STORAGE

02:59:44.807 --> 02:59:46.575
NEEDS. AND HOW DO WE BEGIN TO

02:59:46.642 --> 02:59:48.177
PLAN FOR THAT BECAUSE I THINK

02:59:48.244 --> 02:59:50.112
YOU KNOW IT ACTUALLY I WATCHED

02:59:50.179 --> 02:59:51.814
WHAT I THINK. THREE YEARS AGO

02:59:51.881 --> 02:59:53.349
WHEN WE STARTED THIS LONG STORY

02:59:53.415 --> 02:59:55.050
SEPARATE I HAVE A UNIVERSITY OF

02:59:55.117 --> 02:59:56.652
CUT I MEAN A GROUP OF STUDENTS

02:59:56.719 --> 03:00:08.898
FROM STANFORD. COOKING. TO ME

FOURTH BUT I'M JUST. WAS YOU.

03:00:25.414 --> 03:00:26.282
AGO THREE TO FOUR. YEARS AGO.

03:00:26.348 --> 03:00:28.517
LOW STORE. WAS NOT CONSIDER.

03:00:28.584 --> 03:00:30.452
URGENT NEED. AND I THINK. TODAY

03:00:30.519 --> 03:00:31.587
WE SEE OKAY. PART OF THE MIX.

03:00:31.654 --> 03:00:33.222
THE HAVE TO BE PART OF A I

03:00:33.289 --> 03:00:38.294
WOULD NOT GO. BILL MAKE. FUTURE.

03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:40.162
THAT'S GREAT NOW WHO WILL SERVE.

03:00:40.229 --> 03:00:41.664

APPRECIATE THAT A AFTER AT THE

03:00:47.236 --> 03:00:51.073
AND THIS KIND AGAIN FORMAT- I

03:00:51.140 --> 03:00:53.142
JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY A COUPLE-

03:00:53.209 --> 03:00:54.777
TO AN ADDER TO- WOOD MISTER

03:00:54.843 --> 03:00:56.312
GRAY THEY WERE SAYING. AS THE

03:00:56.378 --> 03:00:58.080
FIRST ONE I'M GONNA. IT IN THE

03:00:58.147 --> 03:00:59.682
NOW THAT WE DID. WITH THAT

03:00:59.748 --> 03:01:01.350
COUGH PUBLIC UTILITIES. DATA WE

03:01:01.417 --> 03:01:02.384
HAVE FOUND THAT THE ONE OUR

03:01:02.451 --> 03:01:03.919
REMOVE ENERGY SHORTFALL. HAPPEN

03:01:03.986 --> 03:01:05.588
ONE EVERY TEN YEARS NOT ONCE A

03:01:05.654 --> 03:01:06.555
THIRTY. THE THESE HAPPEN OF

03:01:06.622 --> 03:01:08.090
WITHIN THE RELIABILITY PLANNING

03:01:08.157 --> 03:01:10.092
STANDARDS UP TO DATE AND THE

03:01:10.159 --> 03:01:11.594
FIFTY OUR SHORTFALLS ACTUALLY

03:01:11.660 --> 03:01:13.562
HAPPEN EVERY OTHER YEAR. THESE

03:01:13.629 --> 03:01:14.863
ARE AT THEIR KNEES ARE ACTUALLY

03:01:14.930 --> 03:01:16.498
VERY COMMON IT AND SO. WHAT I

03:01:16.565 --> 03:01:18.567
WOULD EMPHASIZE THAT IN IN IN

03:01:18.634 --> 03:01:19.702
THIS IS THE POINT THAT BUILT ON

03:01:19.768 --> 03:01:20.636
WHAT BANISTER GREAT GREAT IT

03:01:20.703 --> 03:01:22.037
WAS JUST SAYING IS THAT. WE

03:01:22.104 --> 03:01:24.273
EXPECT THESE LONGER DURATION OR

03:01:24.340 --> 03:01:25.774
MULTI DAY STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES

03:01:25.841 --> 03:01:27.576
TO BE PARTICIPATING IN THAT

03:01:27.643 --> 03:01:29.278
CASE- MARKETS AND YOU KNOW

03:01:29.345 --> 03:01:31.247
OTHER ENERGY MARKETS EVERY

03:01:31.313 --> 03:01:31.814
SINGLE DAY EARNING REVENUES

03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:34.583
EVERY SINGLE DAY. AND ON TOP OF

03:01:34.650 --> 03:01:37.119
THAT THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO

03:01:37.186 --> 03:01:39.188
POWER US THROUGH THESE THESE-

03:01:39.255 --> 03:01:40.756
LOW RENEWABLE ENERGY EVENTS THE

03:01:40.823 --> 03:01:43.225
SHORTFALLS. AND SO I WOULD I

03:01:43.292 --> 03:01:45.427
JUST WOULD- WANT TO EMPHASIZE

03:01:45.494 --> 03:01:46.662
THAT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT

03:01:46.729 --> 03:01:48.130
WE NEED TO KIND OF PAY TO SIT

03:01:48.197 --> 03:01:49.965
AROUND AND DO NOTHING FOR THE

03:01:50.032 --> 03:01:51.700
ONCE EVERY THIRTY YEARS. THESE

03:01:51.767 --> 03:01:52.935
ARE THINGS THAT WE REALLY DO

03:01:53.002 --> 03:01:54.903
BELIEVE WILL BE ECONOMIC. WITH

03:01:54.970 --> 03:01:56.438
THE RIGHT SUPPORT AND KIND OF

03:01:56.505 --> 03:01:57.940
THE RIGHT RAMP UP OVER TIME I

03:01:58.007 --> 03:01:59.608
SAY WE CAN ENTER THE MARKET AND

03:01:59.675 --> 03:02:00.809
REALLY PARTICIPATE ON A LEVEL

03:02:00.876 --> 03:02:06.815
PLAYING FIELD. YUP. BUT ON THE

03:02:06.882 --> 03:02:07.383
DAY TO DAY BASIS. YOU'RE NOT

03:02:07.449 --> 03:02:08.117
GOING TO BE USED. A HOURS TO

03:02:08.183 --> 03:02:10.185
STORE YOU'RE GOING TO BE. SAY

03:02:10.252 --> 03:02:11.820
FIVE. AND YOU CAN MAKE YOUR

03:02:11.887 --> 03:02:15.958
MONEY. IN THIS DAILY WORK JUST

03:02:16.025 --> 03:02:19.561
WITH FIVE. BUT WE NEED A

03:02:19.628 --> 03:02:22.831
HUNDRED. AND SO THAT'S TWENTY

03:02:22.898 --> 03:02:26.835
TIMES THE BEING IT LEAST

03:02:26.902 --> 03:02:27.536
INVESTMENT IN HARDWARE I DON'T

03:02:27.603 --> 03:02:30.706
KNOW WHAT IT IT COUNTS FOR

03:02:30.773 --> 03:02:32.641
OVERALL BUT THE POINT IS.

03:02:32.708 --> 03:02:34.176
NOBODY'S GOING TO BE OUT THERE

03:02:34.243 --> 03:02:37.379
AND THINKING OH I'M GONNA SELL

03:02:37.446 --> 03:02:39.481
A HUNDRED HOURS EVERY TEN YEARS

03:02:39.548 --> 03:02:40.582
AND SO WELL BUILT TO THAT

03:02:40.649 --> 03:02:43.752
CAPACITY NOW. DAILY BASIS FIVE

03:02:43.819 --> 03:02:45.754
HOURS THAT'S WHAT WE NEED

03:02:45.821 --> 03:02:46.288
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE GONNA

03:02:46.355 --> 03:02:48.590
BELTED- YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET

03:02:48.657 --> 03:02:50.559
A VENTURE CAPITAL GUY I DON'T

03:02:50.626 --> 03:02:54.163
THINK. WHO SAYS OH WELL- YOU

03:02:54.229 --> 03:02:56.665
KNOW. THE PRICE OF ELECTRICITY

03:02:56.732 --> 03:02:59.835
