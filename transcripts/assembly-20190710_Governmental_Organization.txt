FOR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDING CONSTRUCTION. CALIFORNIA HAS A SEVERE MORTALITY CRISIS DUE TO THE DROUGHT AND TO THE WESTERN BARK BEETLE WHICH IS CAUSING MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TREES. PER YEAR ANNUALLY TO DIE. YES I SAID DIE AND IF YOU GO TO THE SEARS YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IT ISN'T MUCH FOR YOU. TO HARD FOR YOU TO SEE THE DEATH AND DEVASTATION THAT'S OCCURRING. THE DEAD -- TREE BUILD UP IN OUR FORCE FUELS IS INCREASING AND THE THREAT OF CATASTROPHIC WILDFIRES SUCH AS WE'VE SEEN -- IN THIS LAST COUPLE OF YEARS IS JUST HORRIFIC. THE PARADISE FIRE AS AN EXAMPLE COVERED OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND ACRES DESTROYING NEARLY NINETEEN THOUSAND STRUCTURES AND FOURTEEN THOUSAND HOMES WERE LOST. AND SADLY EIGHTY SIX LIVES IN NOT FIRE WERE LOST. OVERGROWN FORESTS ARE CONTRIBUTING FACTOR TO THE TREE MORTALITY CRISIS THE SEER WATERSHED SUPPLY AND MUCH OF THE STATE WATER FOR FARMS IN URBAN AREAS [inaudible] ARE OVERGROWN. THAT WATER IS BEING ABSORBED BY TREES INSTEAD OF GOING TO THE MUCH NEEDED AREAS THAT ARE REFERRED. TO ACR ONE OUT TO ASK THE OFFICE OF THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL TO SIMPLY ADOPT RULES FOR THE USE OF MASS TIMBER PRODUCTS. BY DOING SO CALIFORNIA WOULD BE ABLE TO EXPAND ITS MARKET FOR THE IN STATE WOOD PRODUCTS AND WOULD HELP. PROVIDE LESS FUELS FOR WILDFIRES AND REDUCE THE CARBON EMISSIONS. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS KRISTIN CALL PAKI WITH A CALIFORNIA FOREST ASSOCIATION AND SHE'S HERE TO ASSISTING ALSO GIVE ADDED TESTIMONY.

YOUR SINGLE BECKY WITH THE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION MASS TIMBER IS A CATEGORY OF FRAMING USING PREFABRICATED SOLID ENGINEERED WOOD PANELS THAT ARE LIGHT WEIGHT YET VERY STRONG WITH HIGH ACOUSTIC FIRE SEISMIC AND THERMAL PERFORMANCE. IT'S FAST AND EASY TO INSTALL MASS TIMBER OFFERS DESIGN FLEXIBILITY AS WELL AS LOW ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS. CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER IS PROBABLY THE MOST COMMONLY USED FORM OF MASS TIMBER. THE BENEFITSA MASKED MEMBER INCLUDE REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION TIMBERS THE BUILDING MATERIAL WITH THE LOWEST ENERGY CONSUMPTION. IT'S FIRE RESISTANT MASS TIMBER PRODUCTS RESIST THE EFFECTS OF FIRE THROUGH THE CHARRING OF THE OUTER LAYER BUT INSULATING THE UNBURNED WOULD AT THE CORE THAT MAINTAINS THE STRENGTH OF THE PRODUCT. REDUCE CO TWO EMISSIONS CROSS LAMINATED TIMBER HAS A LIGHTER CARBON FOOTPRINT SINCE WOOD PRODUCTS CONTINUE TO STORE CARBON ABSORBED BY THE TREES WHILE THEY WERE GROWING. AND WHAT IS THE ONLY MAJOR BUILDING MATERIAL THAT GROWS NATURALLY AND IS RENEWABLE. ACR IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER ACTIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE AND THE INTERNATIONAL CODE COUNCIL.

SIX SEVENTY AND JUST WANT TO SPEAK AS YOU KNOW IT'S NO SECRET ARE STATES BEEN JUST DEVASTATED BY WILDFIRES OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND ESPECIALLY OUR COUNTY IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WAS.

IN MUTUAL AID AND WHAT WE LEARNED IS AS TOWERS WENT DOWN WE DIDN'T GET THE INFORMATION QUICKLY AS LINES ARE BURNED WE CAN GET THE INFORMATION SO WE COULDN'T ADJUST OUR RESOURCES ACCORDINGLY. AND ONE OF THE THINGS IS ALL OF OUR ALERT AND WARNING SYSTEMS GO OUT OVER TELECOMMUNICATIONS.

REGULATION SOMETHING WE HAD ASKED MR REQUIRE. FOR AND HE HAS DONE AND SO WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THAT -- PROCESS WISE SO IN IN DECEPTION THOSE -- A P. REGULATIONS THERE'S A DATE CERTAIN BY WHEN THOSE REGULATIONS NEED TO BE IN PLACE LAST JULY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY OUR OUR CONCERN IS INITIATING THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW YOU WILL BE GETTING A BILL FROM THE SENATE AB TEN FIFTY FOUR WHICH TALKS ABOUT EMERGENCY REGULAR TO TALK ABOUT REGULATIONS FOR WILDFIRES. IN THAT RATE IN THAT PROPOSAL THERE'S L&lt;c.cyan&gt;G SAYS SAYS WITHIN&lt;/c&gt; FOURTEEN DAYS OF THAT BILL BECOMING OPERATIVE. THE DEPARTMENT OF THE CAN THE OFFICE WILL START ESTABLISHING THIS APA PROCESS WE LIKE THAT DATE CERTAINTY SO WE WILL LIKELY SEE SOMETHING SIMILAR HERE AND THIS PROPOSAL THAT WILL DIRECT CAL -- YES TO BEGIN THAT EPA PROCESS WITH IN A TIMELY FASHION -- EITHER FOURTEEN DAYS OR BEFORE THE END OF JANUARY -- THE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT'S IN THE BILL CURRENTLY THERE'S AN EXCEPTION EXEMPTION TO THE APA PROCESS IN SUBSECTION BE. IN SUBSECTION BE OF THE APA PROCESS SAYS THAT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS NEED TO BE ADOPTED IF YOU CAN JUSTIFY A CERTAIN -- ELEMENT THAT NEEDS TO BE INDEED THE URGENCY AND AND HOW YOU PLAN TO RESPOND TO THAT ARTS AND ISSUE -- AND WE LIKE THAT WE THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT GOVERNMENT'S PIECE OF THE APA PROCESS MORE IMPORTANTLY IN THAT SUBSECTION BE THOUGH IS THAT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ARE ONLY GOOD FOR CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS. THEN AFTER THAT YOU MUST RE JUSTIFY WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND WHY HAVEN'T YOU MAY PROGRESS IN YOUR OTHER -- REGULAR RULE MAKING PROCESS THIS. YES IF YOU WOULD MIND COMING UP TO THE FRONT. I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE SOME QUESTIONS POTENTIALLY I KNOW BOTH COX'S HAVE A SUPPORT IF AMENDED POSITION OKAY SO THE MAYBE SOME FALSE IF YOU COME UP HERE. AND BE AVAILABLE. TO ARTICULATE FURTHER. YOU CAN FINISH YOUR COMMENT YEAH AND THAT THAT ESSENTIALLY WAS THE END OF MY COMMENT TO CUT IT UP THE COMMENT WAS THAT -- THERE ARE SOME GOOD GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS IN THE APA PROESS AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE THOSE GOOD GOVERNANCE PROVISIONS. PREVAIL SO BY PROVIDING AN EXEMPTION IN THE PROCESS -- EMERGENCY REGULATIONS COULD GO ON FOREVER SO WHAT ARE NOT TOTALLY FOR BUT YOU CAN KEEP EXTENDING THE HUNDRED EIGHTY DAYS SO. THERE ARE SOME PROTECTIONS IN THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER IS BEING ADOPTED IS BEING ADOPTED CONSISTENT WITH WHATEVER THE EMERGENCY IS SO THAT WAS THE END OF OUR REQUESTS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS STEVE CARLSON PROCEED TIER THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION WE ARE WE TO OUR SUPPORT OF AMENDED WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. EXTENSIVELY WITH THAT SENTIMENT WIRE AND HIS STAFF AND THE AND JUST OF A COUPLE LITTLE THINGS THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE WE APPRECIATE THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS. THAT REMOVES -- A AS A THRESHOLD THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS SOME PLACES IT WITH THE APPROXIMATE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WE THINK THAT MAKES THE BILL MUCH MORE WORKABLE WE ARE THERE'S ANOTHER PROVISION IN THE BILL WHAT WE HAVE TO MAKE THAT CHANGE TO MAKE IT MORE CONSISTENT -- THERE'S ANOTHER A PROVISION IN TERMS OF THE CONTACT PERSON THE BILL NOW SAYS A SPECIFIC PERSON WE THINK THAT THAT SHOULD BE DONE IN A MORE GENERAL WAY MAKE SURE YOU HAVE SOMEBODY TO CALL. AND THAT THEY'RE ALWAYS AVAILABLE -- AND THAT WITH THAT I THINK THAT WILL WILL BE FINE WITH THE BILL -- AGAIN WE RESPECT AND AND HAVE BUT MOST OF STEEP FOR FIRST RESPONDERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS. THAT THIS WORKS. THANK YOU. SENATOR -- ARE YOU CLEAR ON WHAT I KNOW WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM IN A POSITION FROM THE COMMITTEE -- CONSISTENT WITH SOME TESTIMONY WHICH IS GIVEN THEIR THAT RELATES. TO ONLY MAKE SURE I GET THAT RIGHT WHAT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS WERE THE REALLY THE RULE MAKING PROCESS THE THE REGULAR RULEMAKING PROCESS -- ALONG WITH A LOAD I NOTICED A LITTLE TRICKERY FIRST AND THEN OF COURSE ALLOWING CALLOW YESTER DOCTORS REGULATIONS IF THEY CAN'T MEET THE TORCH WENT DEAD LIKE CONSISTENT WITH YOUR GOALS I BELIEVE. THAT SOUND FAMILIAR TO YOU. SO IF IT'S OKAY MATURED LIKE TO BE A COMMENT ON THAT. ABSOLUTELY OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SO LOOK. I'LL TALK ABOUT THE THE CUSTOMER SECTION THE CUSTOMER SECTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH I SPECIFICALLY IN SO -- WHERE -- MISTER CROSSING WAS DISCUSSING RATHER THAN THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS THAT ARE IMPACTED WE'RE GOING TO TALK CITIES. COUNTY SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ADD THAT WE'VE ALREADY CLEANED UP THERE'S ONE ADDITIONAL SECTION AND WE NEED TO BE A CLEAN THAT UP. WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO FIGURE THAT OUT ON THE ISSUE OF IN INDIVIDUAL TO CALL I WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE INDUSTRY BUT THEY'RE VERY WORRIED THAT IT'S GONNA BE. ONE INDIVIDUAL AND WANTING TO BE ABLE TO BE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS THAT'S ANOTHER CLEAN UP THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. ON THE ISSUES AMER EMERGENCY REGULATIONS I WENT TAKE A MOMENT TO SPEAK ON THAT. SO HERE'S WHAT THIS BILL WILL DO RIGHT NOW. SO IT WOULD REQUIRE A WE ASKED TO COMPLETE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY BY THE WAY THE RECENT EMERGENCY ALERT BILL THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR. WENT THROUGH THE SAME EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. AND WE ARE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. I'D LIKE TO TALK TO YOU BUT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE IS REQUIRED WHEN IT COMES TO EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. THE LEGISLATURE IT'S IMPLEMENTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS FOR FAR LESS THAN THE CRISIS WE ARE HERE TODAY. LAST YEAR ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED. ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED. FROM WILD AND FIRES. MAJORITY OF THEM DID NOT GET THE ALERT. IN FACT WHAT WE KNOW IS WHEN YOU ARE DOING AN OPT IN SYSTEM THIRTY MAYBE 40% ARE RECEIVING AN ALERT. THIS THE LEGISLATURE IS ADOPTED MERCY REGULATIONS ON BINGO. WE'VE ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ON PRIVATE OUTDOOR CAMPING PROGRAMS. WE'VE ADOPTED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ON WATER EFFICIENCY. IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME. AND I WILL SPEAK PERSON TO THIS AND I DO NOT NEED TO GET EMOTIONAL BUT IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THE TIME IS NOW WHEN IT COMES. TO NINE ONE ONE OUTAGES AND EMERGENCY ALERTS. OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE SEEN THE TWO LARGEST FIRES IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY IN FACT LAST YEAR. SENATOR GALLAGHER CENTER NIELSEN SAW THE LARGEST FIRE IN AMERICAN HISTORY MOST DESTRUCTIVE IN THE MOST DEADLY. AND OVER A HUNDRED FOLKS DIED. ROOM WHENEVER MERCY REGULATIONS ARE DONE THERE IS AN EXISTING PUBLIC COMMENT WINDOW AND I'LL JUST BE CANDID THE REASON WHY THERE ARE SOME THAT DON'T LIKE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IS BECAUSE THE COMMENT WINDOW IS FIVE DAYS. THAT'S THE REAL REASON IT'S FIVE DAYS. FURTHER IN ORDER TO MAKE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS PERMITTED THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD ON A PARALLEL EFFORT AND WE'VE ALREADY CHECKED THIS WITH -- YES. BUT THROUGH THE REGULAR RULEMAKING PROCESS WITH A FORTY FIVE DAY PUBLIC COMMENT WINDOW THIS IS BECAUSE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ONLY LASTS FOR ONE YEAR. SB SIX SEVENTY DOES NOT EXEMPT -- YES FROM ANY OF THE NOTICE REQUIREMENTS REQUIRED ON THE EMERGENCY RULE MAKING PROCESS NO ONE INJURED RIGHT HERE RESPOND TO THIS ISSUE AND AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THE INDUSTRY BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN WORKING. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT WE WORKING TOGETHER. DURING THE CAMP FIRE THAT BEGAN AROUND SIX THIRTY THREE AM. THE STATE RECEIVED THE FIRST NOTICE IT NINE ONE ONE WAS OUT. FIVE HOURS AFTER THE FIRE STARTED. PARADISE WAS ALREADY LOST. WE DID NOT KNOW THAT NINE ONE ONE OR BIRDS THERE'S FOR HIDDEN FOLKS. WHEN IT CAME TO THE TUBS FIRE IN MY OWN BACKYARD? IT BEGAN AT NINE FORTY THREE PM ON OCTOBER EIGHTH. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FCC NOTIFIED THE STATE SIX HOURS SIX HOURS AFTER THE FIRE STARTED. PEOPLE DO NOT KNOW THEY COULDN'T CALL 911- THEY WERE NOT RECEIVING EMERGENCY ALERTS. IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME TO BE ABLE TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WITH THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES IT'S AFTER ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE DIED ON THE WORST WILDLAND FIRE IN OUR STATE HISTORY. SO WE ARE WORKING WITH INDUSTRY I GIVE YOU MY WORD AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK WITH INDUSTRY YOU HAVE MY PROMISE THIS IS A BIPARTISAN BILL THIS IS COMMON SENSE OF WHAT I WOULD ASK. A IN THE DOES INTO THE CHAIR TO BE ABLE TO LEAVE THIS BILL INTACT BECAUSE THIS IS GOING TO MEAN CANDIDLY LIVES SAVED ACROSS CALIFORNIA NINE I NEGLECTED TO MENTION MISTER CHAIR -- SIMILAR GALLAGHER WHO HAS BEEN A CHAMPION ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL I APOLOGIZE IN THEIR GALLAGHER FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL -- AND I WOULD -- ASK THE CHAIR TO BE A TO KEEP THIS BILL INTACT AS IS ALLOW US TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IT'S CRITICAL. TO GET ADOPTED PRIOR TO NEXT FIRE SEASON SIR -- BEFORE WE GO TO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS LET'S TAKE LET'S FINISH OUR TESTIMONY I WE HAVE BEEN OF A SIDE BAR THAT WE HAVE ANY -- TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND WE HAVE SUPPORT OF AMENDED WE HAVE SOME SUPPORT ANY OPPOSITION. SEEN AT THIS TIME IT'S GREAT BACK TO THE MEMBERS. FOR QUESTIONS [inaudible] COMMENTS CONCERNS [inaudible] MR GALLAGHER -- YES THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I I JUST WANT OF FACTLY AGREE WITH WHAT WAS STATED. BY THE SENATOR HERE -- YOU KNOW WE SAW THIS FIRST HAND THAT -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE DID NOT GET ALERTS -- THAT ARE EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION -- HAS GAPS IN IT HAS SOME SERIOUS GAPS IN IT -- AND SO THIS BILL I THINK IS A VERY REASONABLE WAY OF TRYING TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE. TOO YOUR WORK THROUGH HELLO YES HAVE THE INDUSTRY WORK TO CALLOW YES TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE KNOW -- WHEN THERE ARE OUTAGES -- THAT AFFECT -- NINE ONE ONE YOU KNOW. HERE ONE OF THE BEST THINGS WE CAN DO IS GIVE PEOPLE ALL THE TOOLS AND THE KNOWLEDGE THAT HE AT LEAST GIVE THEM THE KNOWLEDGE OF OF OF WHAT LIMITATIONS ARE. WHILE WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO IMPROVE. EMERGENCY NOTIFICATION AND MAKE THAT MUCH STRONGER AND MAKE SURE THAT ALL MEDIA THIS -- ARE WORKING TO TO HELP PEOPLE GET THEM THE LATEST AND BEST INFORMATION IN THE EVENT OF AN EMERGENCY -- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS SAID YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD ASK -- THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY WITH IN A LOT OF WORK -- WORKING WITH INDUSTRY ON THIS AS WELL -- SO AGAIN I THINK IT'S AS HE SAID VERY WELL. IF NOT OW I DON'T KNOW WHEN BECAUSE WE WE WE CLEARLY NEED TO TO ACT ON THIS QUICKLY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR [inaudible] THIS REGULAR. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS. MAYBE YOU COULD HELP US. AS YOU WERE ARTICULATING THEIR YOU WERE SHARING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE PARADISE FIRE. WHICH YOU KNOW I JUST SPOKE A FEW MINUTES AGO TALKING ABOUT THE THE FOLKS AND AND AND I ACR THAT I'M CARRYING -- AND THE IMPACTS OF WITH THAT. HAPPENED THERE THE GIVEN THAT SAID EVEN WITH YOUR OWN TUBS FIRE BOTH OF AND THE COMMON LINKAGE. NO REVERSE NINE ONE ONE NO NINE ONE ONE SYSTEM. IN THOSE CASES WOULD HAVE WORKED. BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WENT DOWN RAPIDLY. THEREFORE THOSE PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NEVER GOTTEN THEIR NOTICES EVEN UNDER THIS BILLS -- SYNOPSIS -- AND THE NINETY MINUTE NOTICE FOR YOU. TO HAVE FROM THE TELCOS TO GET BACK TO YOU. IS IS ALMOST UNDOABLE -- JUST. A LITTLE HISTORY THERE ARE BECAUSE IT TAKES AWHILE TO ACTUALLY VERIFY [inaudible] THAT'S THAT'S ONE JUST KIND OF STATEMENT -- THE OTHER ISSUE IS I THINK THE QUALIFICATION OF WHAT IS A COMMUNITY MEAN OR WHAT IS THAT I CENTRIC AREA MEAN IS THAT. ONE USER FOR USERS. IS IT MORE THAN THAT. THAT'S THAT'S A QUESTION. AND THE AND THE IF I COULD ALL ALL AT A SECOND QUESTION ON THIS IF YOU WANT TO RESPOND TO THAT SO I DON'T COMPOUND. NO GO AHEAD IF THE ONE ON TO THAT AND THEN I'LL ASK MYSELF. THANK YOU SO LET'S TALK ABOUT ON THE ISSUE OF DISCOVERY SO. IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL IT SIXTY MINUTES. UPON DISCOVERY. NOTIFICATION. SO -- AND THE REASON WHY THAT IS SO IMPORTANT -- IS THAT ALLOWS INDUSTRY TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE pAND THEN AFTER THE OUTAGE HAS BEEN DISCOVERED A CUT CABLE FOR EXAMPLE. A BURNED FIBER LINE. WITHIN ONE HOUR THAT DISCOVERY. THEY WOULD THEN CALL INTO THE CALIFORNIA WARNING CENTER WITH THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES. TWO CURRENTLY ASTHE BILL AS DRAFTED IT WOULD BE ANY. NINE ONE ONE OUT EACH. ANY OUTAGE IMPACTING AN EMERGENCY ALERT LINE. WE ON THE ISSUE OF PARADISE -- ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES AND I WILL ALSO SPEAK FOR THE TUBS FIRE AS WELL [inaudible] IS THAT. PARADISE WE HAD THE BUTTE COUNTY SHERIFF HE HE WISHES HE COULD BE HERE TESTIFIED PREVIOUSLY -- THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THOSE ALERTS FOR NOT HITTING RESIDENTS. A NO IS DOWN. WE DIDN'T KNOW IS DOWN BECAUSE THE FCC GETS THE FIRST NOTICE OF AN OUTAGE. YES YOU SEE THEN BECAUSE THE P. YOU SEE. PC SHOULD HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT DEALING WITH FIRST RESPONDERS. THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT. WITHIN SIXTY MINUTES OF AN OUTAGE. AND I'M MAKING THIS UP AT THE MOMENT EIGHTEEN T. VERIZON WHOEVER THAT CARRIER MAY BE. WOULD NOTIFY THE WARNING CENTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THE WARNING CENTER WOULD THEN CALL. THE EMERGENCY MANAGER. IN WHATEVER COUNTY. THERE'S BEEN IMPACTED BY THE INCIDENT. SO I THINK IT'S COMMONSENSE IT CUTS THAT MIDDLEMAN WHICH WE SIMPLY DO NOT NEED -- AND BUT IT WOULD BE SIX IN HIS POND DISCOVERY. OKAY SO THAT GETS SENT TO PART OF MY SECOND QUESTION BT IT TO ME -- BACK UP AND HAVE A FIRST QUESTION A PART A PLEASE -- IN THE IN THE PARADISE AND AND TUBS -- SCENARIOS. HOW WOULD THAT TELL BECAUSE OF NO? HOW WOULD THEY HAVE KNOWN RIGHT AWAY AND VERIFIED THAT THEY DID HAVE AN OUTAGE THEIR FIBER WAS BURNED? THAT'S THAT'S REAL GOOD HOW WOULD THEY KNOW WITHOUT VERIFYING. AND WHEN THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO GO IN BECAUSE IT'S A DISASTER ZONE IT'S AN IMPACTS ON HOW WOULD THEY BE ABLE TO SEND A CREW OUT TO VERIFY AND HOW LONG WOULD THAT TAKE SO THEY WERE ABLE TO ERIFY ENOUGH TO THE FCC THAT THE FIRST. AND THIS IS ACCORDING THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES STATE RECORDS -- I DON'T HAVE THE SPECIFIC CARRIER BUT THE FIRST NOTIFICATION -- IT CAME INTO THE FCC -- WITH THE CAMPFIRE. FIVE HOURS LATER. AFTER THE START. IT CAME IN FIVE HOURS EARLIER TO THE FCC -- THE TUBS FIRE. IT WAS I HAVE THEY KNEW AT APPROXIMATELY NINE FORTY FIVE TENNIS PM THE TUBS FIRE THAT THEIR OUTAGES -- IN THE STATE DIDN'T FIND OUT ABOUT THAT OUTAGE UNTIL FOUR TWELVE AM IN THE NEXT MORNING. SO IT TOOK AWHILE. MORE NO EIGHT SO THAT NOTED THAT NOTICE WHEN TO THE FCC WHAT TOOK A WHILE IS FOR THE FCC TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE STATE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT CUTS THE MIDDLE PERSON OUT. IN THERE SHOULD BE NO REASON AT THE SEC'S INVOLVED IN THIS AND SO RIGHT NOW THIS RIDICULOUS CHAIN AND EVENTS AND I DON'T MEAN TO I'M. NOT PLACE TIME AND I APOLOGIZE. IT'S QUITE ALRIGHT I THINK THIS IS WHAT THIS WHOLE PROCESS IS ABOUT NEWS IT'S GOOD FOR US BECAUSE TYPICALLY OF LATE WE WE HAVEN'T HAD THIS DETAILED DISCUSSION. ON IN COMMITTEES AND I THINK THIS WEEK IN PARTICULAR WOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE DETAILED DISCUSSION YEAH TO BETTER UNDERSTAND SO WE HAVE THE BEST PRODUCT GOING FORWARD. FOR ALL PEOPLE I MEAN I'M ON YOUR PAGER YEAH I'M TRYING TO GET. GET THERE SO SO TRY TO WORK IT THROUGH. I UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN THAT FIBER WIN OUT THERE'S ALMOST AN INSTANTANEOUS -- A SPARK THAT OCCURS INSIDE A COMPLETE COMPUTER AND THEN IT SENDS UP INTO A RING LOOP WHICH AT THAT MOMENT IN THE BLINK OF YOUR AYE THAT YOU JUST POINT THREE TIMES FOUR TIMES SIX TIMES DOWN. IT SHOT. A SIGNAL AND REVERSE THAT COURSE AND MAY HAVE SENATE A HUNDRED MILES AROUND BUT THIS CONTINUITY DIDN'T BREAK. WHAT REALLY HAPPENED NINE ONE ONE DID GO DOWN NO NO NO? IT DID. BECAUSE THERE WAS NO MORE. I ABILITY FOR TO CONNECT. AND WHEN IT DIDN'T CONNECT IT WAS COMPLETELY LOST BUT NOBODY COULD TELL YOU WHY ARE IF IT WAS A SIMPLE FIX WITHIN A GLITCH OF A COMPUTER AND THEY NEEDED TO VERIFY THAT BUT THEY DIDN'T THEY DIDN'T KNOW THAT IT. WAS GOING DOWN BUT IT TOOK A TRYING TO WORK THROUGH. THE WITHIN THE INTERNAL SYSTEM AS WELL. SO THE CHALLENGE THAT -- MINOR SEEN THE CHALLENGE AND I CAN LET DECISION CHAIR OF NO I MEAN THERE WERE OUTAGES FOR EXAMPLE AND SAY NO MY COUNTY. AND FOLKS WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO CALLING NOW 911- READ COM WAS RECEIVING NINE ONE ONE CALLS FROM AROUND OTHER AREAS OF THE COUNTY BUT DID NOT REALIZE THAT THEIR OUTAGES IN SPECIFIC AREAS THAT WERE BEING IMPACTED BY THE TUBS FIRE. THIS BILL SOLVES THAT SO LET'S JUST SAY YOU KNOW USE THE TUBS FIRE EXIT FOR EXAMPLE IF WE HAVE AN OUTAGE UPON MARK WHY SPRINGS ROAD. BECAUSE THE FIRES BURNED. I'M I'M USING THIS IMAGE EXAMPLE EIGHTEEN TI WOULD THEN CALL THE WARNING CENTER THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN. WHAT HAPPENS NOW IS IF A FIBERS BURN A FIBER IS BURNED? INDUSTRY WILL CALL THE SEC THEY'RE FEDERALLY REGULATED UTILITY. SEC THEN DOESN'T MAKE SENSE. BECAUSE THE PC. UNDERSTAND THEIR COUNTERPART. IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE BECAUSE PC HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FLIPPING DISASTERS. SO THIS LITTLE IT CUTS THE MIDDLE PERSON WILL BE ABLE -- TO GET THIS IN -- ESSENTIALLY REAL TIME BUT AGAIN WE PROVIDE FOR SIXTY MINUTES UPON DISCOVERING THIS BILL SO THIS IS A GOOD EXCHANGE FOR ROOM BECAUSE YOU'RE HEARING A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION. AND AGAIN I'M GOING TO REITERATE I'M ON YOUR PAYCHECK -- ON THIS SO -- A JUST ON THEIR CLOTHES I HAVE TWO CLARIFICATION TIER ONE WHAT WHAT WHAT WOULD BE THE NUMBER WOULD BE JUST ONE PHONE THAT'S OUT. CURRENTLY IS THE BILL READS IT IS ANY OUTAGE YES THAT'S CURRENTLY HAVE THE BILL READS OKAY. SO THE SO THAT CAN BE. I'M JUST GONNA SAY THIS EDITORIAL THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR SOME OF THOSE MORE RURAL COMMUNITIES -- WHERE THEY THEY HAVE THE ONE OFF PERSON THAT LIVES SEVERAL MILES OUT AND? THAT MAY NOT BE EVEN AN OUTAGE BECAUSE OF THE TELCO THAT MAY BE AN OUTAGE BECAUSE THEIR OWN -- PHONIES GONE BAD -- STILL CAN'T CONNECT IF THE PHONE DOESN'T GET ENERGIZED BECAUSE IT'S NOT WORKING. SO THAT'S JUST A SIMPLE ONE BUT LET ME COME BACK. TO REALLY WHAT. WELL I'M JUST GONNA GO OVER. I THINK THE CHAIR ASKED A LEGITIMATE QUESTION AND I'D LIKE TO TRY TO GET SOME RESOLVED BECAUSE I THINK MEMBERS HERE WILL WANT. WE HAVE SOME I THINK GOOD -- SUPPORTABLE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORTH BY THE COMMITTEE AND I THINK THOSE ARE WORKABLE AND MAKE IT FAR MORE SUPPORTABLE AN EASIER TO SUPPORT TODAY -- IS -- WILL YOU BE WILLING TO TAKE THOSE AMENDMENTS AND AND WORK WITH THEM FROM HERE. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR LOOK I AM NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT WHATSOEVER AND I HOPE IN THE COMING OFFICE IS RESPECTFUL. WE'VE TAKEN AMENDMENTS ALREADY THAT WOULD ALLOW -- YES TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE THRESHOLD. SO WHEN IT COMES -- TO NICE YOUR BIGELOW WHEN HE WAS JUST REFERRING TO IN REGARDS TO AS THE BILL CURRENTLY READS. IF THERE IS ONE PERSON -- THEN YES IT WOULD BE REPORTABLE. BUT WHAT WE HAVE IN THE BILL IS THAT -- YES WILL EVENTUALLY CREATE THE THRESHOLD SO THEY WILL CREATE THE THRESHOLD OF HOW MANY CUSTOMERS RIGHT SO THAT WILL ACTUALLY THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW THAT ALLOWS A WE ASKED. TO BE TO CREATE THE THRESHOLD -- AND WE'VE WORK WITH INDUSTRY ON THAT. I AM NOT AT ALL BE DIFFICULT BUT I'M I'M ASKING IF FOR SOME SUPPORT HERE TODAY TO BE A TO KEEP THE BILL INTACT. I'M ASKING YOU FOR THAT -- WE HAVE WORK THIS WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK THIS IN THE REASON WHY SO WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS MORE THAN REASONABLE. AGAIN WE'VE CREATED EMERGENCY REGULATIONS FOR BINGO IN THE STATE. WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO CREATE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO NINE ONE ONE OUTAGES. AND EMERGENCY ALERTS -- AND AND BE HAPPY TO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SIDEBAR MISTER CHAIR -- I'D BE HAPPY TO DO THAT AS WELL -- MOMENTARILY WHATEVER WORKS FOR YOU BUT I WOULD ASK IF YOU BE WILLING TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT. INTACT -- TO ALLOW THESE BE A TO GO INTO EFFECT PRIOR TO NEXT FIRE SEASON. THIS COOPER. SURE MISTER LOOK AT MY QUESTION ABOUT THE FOR TAKING THE MINUTES OR NOT BUT THE THRESHOLD AS FAR AS YES. A LOT TO DO THAT. HOUSE TO THE ESTABLISH A THRESHOLD. IT WOULD BE JULY FIRST. TO TWENTY TWENTY IF WE ALLOW THE EMERGENCY -- REGULATIONS TO TAKE PLACE. SB SIX MONTHS OKAY SIDE I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS WITH YOU CAN TAKE MORE NOT SO. I'LL THROW THAT OUT THERE OKAY MR DAILY. YEAH MY QUESTIONS ARE SIMILAR SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY. YOUR DESIRED DATE FOR THE EMERGENCY REX TO TAKE PLACE AND I GUESS THERE'S BEEN SOME TO IT. IS THAT THE CRUX OF THE DISAGREEMENT ON AMENDMENTS YES. YES PLEASE AND MISTER CHAIR PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M. WRONG I DON'T TOWARD YOUR MOUTH BUT YES THAT'S WHERE WE'D LIKE TO BE IN TO KEEP. SO WHAT WE LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO IS AS THE BILL CURRENTLY READS. A BIRD IS THE REGULATIONS WOULD BE PUT INTO PLACE. THOSE REGULATIONS WOULD BE IDENTIFIED -- AND IMPLEMENTED BY THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES. WE DELEGATE MOST OF THE RESPONSIBILITY IN REGARDS TO THE REGULATIONS AND THRESHOLDS TO THE OFFICE EMERGENCY SERVICES IN THE WHOLE INTENTION ON WHY WE'RE ADOPTING EMERGENCY RAGS FOR DROPPING EMERGENCY RACE TO GET THESE IN PLACE. BY NEXT FIRE SEASON. IF WE DON'T IT WILL MOST LIKELY GO FOR FOUR YEAR. SEVEN WE'RE LOOKING AT FIRE SEASON OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND YOU WANT. THE RAGS IN PLACE BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY YES SIR IN HASN'T THERE BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT IF THEY CAN'T. GET THROUGH THEIR RULE MAKING PROCESS BY THEN. THAT THEY CAN ISSUE. THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS IT. WITH THAT WHAT WOULD THAT ACCOMPLISH YOUR GOAL -- YES I I BELIEVE WOULD BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND GET THEM IMPLEMENTED BY JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY BUT IF FOR SOME REASON [inaudible] THEY CAN'T -- AMID SOMEONE SUGGESTING THAT THEY HAVE THE SHOULD HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER PROCEDURAL DEADLINES REQUIREMENTS. IN THE RULE MAKING PROCESS IS THAT. DOES THAT WORK FOR YOU FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR BILL. WHAT WOULD WORK -- AND AGAIN ULTIMATELY IF THIS MEANS MEANS WHAT I'M HEARING -- THE CHAIR SAY PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG MISTER CHAIR -- ULTIMATELY IF THE DECISION IS IS THIS BILL MOVE FORWARD WITHOUT. EMERGENCY REYES OR NOT -- LOOK. WE'VE LEARNED ABOUT THIS HERE JUST A BIT AGO -- THAT IT -- WANTED BILL TO MOVE FORWARD ON THIS -- I WILL TELL YOU. I THINK THAT. THERE ARE VERY FEW. ISSUES THAT ARE TRULY LIFE OR DEATH. WE NEED TO LEARN FROM OUR STAKE MISTAKES WE'VE HAD SERIOUS MISTAKES. ON EMERGENCY ALERT TO NINE ONE ONE OUTAGES IN THE STATE. IF IT IS THE WILL OF THE COMMITTEE IN IF THIS MEANS THAT THIS BILL WILL NOT GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE OF COURSE I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE THE MEANS. I WOULD SUGGEST TO ALL OF US TODAY. THAT WE KEEP AN INTACT BUT ULTIMATELY IT'S THE WILL OF THE COMMITTEE AND I WILL GO WITH THE CHAIR -- IF THAT MEANS THAT THIS BILL IS GOING -- TO REMAIN ALIVE BECAUSE THAT MEANS MORE PEOPLE ARE GONNA. STAY ALIVE AS WELL [inaudible] MR SAUCE. THANKS TO REQUIRE -- YOU KNOW I WAS JUST. APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IN THIS OBVIOUSLY IT'S A VERY RESPONSIVE. TO TO THE EMERGENCY IS THAT OF A OCCURRED IN THE STATE. BUT YOU KNOW I CENTER THIS BY COMMITTEE STAFF I WAS LOOKING AT THE AND YOU PROVIDED SOME CLARIFICATION BUT JUST HELP ME. UNDERSTAND THE MOMENT SO WE'RE ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT SO ONE WOULD ALLOW CARILLO YES TO ADOPT EMERGENCY REGULATIONS OF THE CAN'T MEET THE JULY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY I KNOW YOU SEE THE AMENDMENTS [inaudible] SOME. MR TERWILLIGER STAFF HAS THE AMENDMENTS. WE WE DO NOT HAVE A COPY. OKAY SO PERHAPS YOU GUYS CAN. WILL DECIDE ON THE A BANDS -- AYE CRITICALLY DEMANDS FOR THEM IS JUDGE US BY THE COMMITTEE MISTER BURN THAT'S THAT THE RULE MAKING PROCESS BEGIN -- UNDER THE REGULAR PROCESS. ISSUE A NOTICE NO LATER THAN FEBRUARY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY AND ALLOW CAL -- YES TO ADOPT EMERGENCY RAKES IF FOR SOME REASON THEY CAN'T MEET THE JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY DEADLINE SO I THINK THE IMMENSE AT LEAST IS JUST WHAT COMMITTEE ARE CONSISTENT WITH WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM YOU -- TODAY ONE COMMENT I WOULD MAKE IS IF IN FACT THERE'S SOME URGENCY TO THE ISSUE WHICH YOU HAVE STAYED THERE IS AND I THINK THE DIALOGUE HAS SUGGESTED IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT -- WE SHOULD WE SHOULD PUT EARNERS BECAUSE OF THE BILL -- NOW WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT HERE TODAY WE COULD DO IT ON THE FLOOR -- WITH THE APPROVAL THE RULES COMMITTEE AND I THINK THERE'S A RULES COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN WRITER SOMEWHERE. MAYBE RIGHT IN FRONT OF ME. AND THAT WOULD BE PERHAPS -- AVENUE TO MOVE THIS EVEN QUICKER -- CONSISTS I THINK WITH YOUR GOAL BUT ALSO GIVE. COMFORT I THINK TO MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE -- WITH THOSE MANSIONS THAT -- SOUND FAIR TO YOU IT IS ABOUT THIS CASE GET A QUICK COPY THE MEANS IS THAT POSSIBLE DISS HIM ABSOLUTELY. SURE WHAT WHAT WE WHAT WE VENTURE FOR SECOND IT CAN I JUST CLARIFY. WHAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED IS NOT TO ELIMINATE THE EMERGENCY OF REGULATION PROCESS? IF YOU INCLUDE THE APA PROCESS IN ANY PROPOSAL. THE APA PROCESS INCLUDES THE ABILITY FOR AN AGENCY TO MAKE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS SO WE ARE NOT OPPOSED TO EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. SO MAYBE WAS IT VERY CLEAR WHAT WE WERE SUGGESTING THAT. YOU MUST ADOPT YOU MUST INITIATE DIRECTOR RULE MAKING PROCESS VERY EARLY ON TO GET THAT GOING IN THE INTERIM. AN AGENCY MAY ISSUE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THAT WE WE WOULD ENCOURAGE THAT. BUT WHAT THE BILL DOES HERE IF YOU READ THE THE LANGUAGE HERE TODAY IT EXEMPTS UNDER SUBSECTION BE OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS SOME DUE PROCESS ISSUES. AND ALL WERE SAYING THIS YOU MUST COMPLY WITH THAT DUE PROCESS ISSUE THE STRUCTURES. ARE THE AMENDMENTS AS DESCRIBED. BY THE CHAIR HERE CONSISTENT WITH YES WITH THOSE WHICH ARE ASKING FOR THOSE ARE YEAH THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS THE THREE ITEMS YES I ACTUALLY GO TO THOSE HUNGRY. THOSE ARE PERFECT. JERRY MCGUIRE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND JUST TAKE A LOOK AT THIS YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME SO -- LOOK I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE WOULD BE THIS. THERE WOULD NOT BE A COMMITMENT IF -- THE EMERGENCY BRAKES AREN'T EMBEDDED IN THE BILL THAT -- WE ASK CAN GET TO GET TO THIS BY JULY FIRST AT TWENTY TWENTY NINE HER DOG YOU TO BE ABLE TO SPEAK WITH. THE LEGISLATIVE UNIT ON THAT. IF THERE WOULD BE AN URGENCY BECAUSE N THAT WE CAN GET POTENTIAL BIPARTISAN SUPPORT OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE THAT THEN TURNS IT INTO A TWO THIRDS VOTE -- WITH THESE AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD THEN GIVE -- WOULD GETTING GIFTS T. -- OFFICE WERE TO SERVICES. TIME TO BE ABLE TO A LONGER RUNWAY TO BE TO GET THIS THING DONE -- PRIOR TO JULY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN NOT AT ALL TRYING TO BE DIFFICULT MEMBERS -- BUT TRULY TRYING TO MAKE THIS FUNCTIONAL FOR THE STATE -- IN I THINK IT'S A IT'S A HUGE GAP THAT -- WILL COST LIVES. I SURELY DON'T SEE IT AS A PARTISAN ISSUE AND IN TALKING WITH OUR VICE CHAIRMAN -- I WOULD ASSUME WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT SEEKING AN URGENCY BECAUSE AND AGAIN THE RULES WHICHEVER COULD SPEAK TO IT IF I'M IF I'M ADELINE HEARING CORRECT I THINK WE COULD PURSUE THAT URGENCY BECAUSE ON THE FOR THAT WOULD IN FACT MOVE THIS QUICKER I THINK THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH. YOUR GOALS AND EACH YEAR SHOULD BE -- AND ACHIEVABLE OUTCOME I THINK OKAY. IN WOULD BE THROUGH THE CHAIR WOULD THAT BE A POSSIBLE ASK VICE CHAIR YOUR THOUGHTS ON THAT IF THAT'S OKAY -- THROUGH THE CHURCH STRUCTURE. AS LONG AS WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT WORK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE IMMINENCE THAT WE HAD. AND THAT YOU HAVE A COPY OF THAT YOU JUST GOT A COPY. AND AND YOU SAY I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T HAVE IT -- PRIOR TO OUR DISCUSSIONS HERE I MADE THE ASSUMPTION -- BUT AS LONG AS WE'VE GOT THAT THE CHAIRS WORKED OUT THE URGENCY I THINK IT WOULD MAKE IT -- SUPPORTABLE. I WILL COMMIT TO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I'M GRATEFUL AND I WILL. WITH THAT THE TWO THIRDS -- THRESHOLD -- WILL COMMIT TO THE THE IMMENSE AS THEY'RE LISTED HERE WITHIN THE WORKSHEET THE QUESTION. MOVE THE BILL.

FOR POINTLESS MASSES AT THIS POINT MEMBERS WERE GOING -- TO MOVE TO ITEM THREE ON YOUR AGENDA AND WELCOME SENATOR WIENER TO PRESENT [inaudible] HIS BILL WELCOME SENATOR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN FOR THE RECORD I DID NOT USE A CURSE WORD AGAINST US AND REQUIRED. FOR THAT'S NOT RELIGIOUS -- ACCUSATION TOLD. MY MOTHER WOULD BE VERY UPSET IF I AND I'M JOINED TODAY -- MISS CHAIRMAN BY -- MY MAIL MULTI YOUR PARTNER IN THIS BILL ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- SANTIAGO I WE WORK HAND IN GLOVE ON THIS BILL -- FOR YEARS NOW -- AND I WANT TO THANK. THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR ALSO HAVING WORKED WITH US FOR A FEW YEARS NOW -- ON THIS -- WE'RE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE COLLABORATION [inaudible] OUR COLLEAGUES. SB FIFTY EIGHT IS A LOCAL CONTROL BILL -- THAT WILL ALLOW. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS CITIES TO MAKE DECISIONS LOCALLY -- ABOUT WHETHER TO HAVE A TWO AM CLOSING TIME. OR TO EXTEND HOURS IF. THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THE CITY COUNCIL CHOOSES TO DO SO. FOR THE LAST APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS HAD A STATEWIDE -- INFLEXIBLE RULE -- THAT ALCOHOL SERVICE MUST. AND A TWO I AM AT THE LATEST WE ALREADY HAVE LOCAL CONTROL IN TERMS CITIES BEING ABLE TO GO EARLIER THAN TWO I AM -- BUT THE BOOM DROPS AT TWO AM AND THAT IS TRUE WHETHER YOU ARE IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES OR SAN FRANCICO. OR WHETHER YOU ARE IN A SMALL RURAL COMMUNITY THAT -- HAS ONE BAR OR HAS NO BARS IT'S THE SAME EVERYWHERE THIS BILL WILL CREATE A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM -- FOR TEN CITIES. AND THOSE TEN CITIES EACH OF THEM HAS REQUESTED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PILOT PROGRAM EITHER THE CITY COUNCIL -- WERE THERE MAYOR -- AND THE BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE -- ANY CITY TO GO PAST TWO AM THE BILL SIMPLY PROVIDES PERMISSION SO THAT THE CITY'S CAN DECIDE -- LOCALLY -- THE BILL IS IDENTICAL TO THE BILL -- THAT YOU ARE ESSENTIALLY IDENTICAL TO THE BILL THAT PASSED OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ALLOWED ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK LAST YEAR EXCEPT. THE CITY OF FRESNO APPROACH US THIS YEAR -- THE MAYOR AND ASKED US TO BE INCLUDED ON SO WE INCLUDED -- FRESNO AFTER CONSULTING WITH YOU TO THE FRESNO REPRESENTATIVES -- THE THE BILL ALSO DOES NOT ALLOW THE-CITY SIMPLY TO ON THE SPUR OF THE MOMENT THE MOMENT OFTEN. IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE A CITY WILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH A LOCAL PROCESS CAN BE ANY OUR COMMUNITY -- TASK FORCE THAT TASK FORCE MUST INCLUDE CHP AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT WAS AN AMENDMENT THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT ASKED US TO TAKE -- IN A PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE BILL AND WE ACCEPT THAT -- THAT AMENDMENT -- AFTER GOING THROUGH THAT PROCESS THIS CITY WILL HAVE TO PRODUCE A PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN. AND A TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO ENSURE THAT IT'S DOING ANALYSIS ABOUT HOW -- TO INSURE SAFETY AND TRANSPORTATION ACCESS -- AND THEN IT'S UP TO THE CITY COUNCIL -- TO DEOTE AND THE CITY COUNCIL IF IT ADOPTS THE PLAN AND APPROVED THE ORDINANCE IT WILL GO TO ABC. WAS ELEVEN SURE THAT EACH OF THE STEPS HAPPENED -- AND AND THEN EVEN AFTER THE PLAN GOES INTO EFFECT. IT'S NOT ANYWAY AUTOMATIC EACH INDIVIDUAL EXTENDED HOURS -- APPLICATION WILL BE REVIEWED IN THE SAME WAY THAT ABC REVIEWS -- LIQUOR PERMITS OR LIQUOR LICENSES INITIALLY AND WITH PUBLIC NOTIFICATION THE ABILITY OF NEIGHBORS TO OBJECT OR HAVE A HEARING OR SEEK MODIFICATIONS. IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE CITIES TO HAVE AN ON SWITCH OFF SWITCH FOR THEIR ENTIRE CITY IN FACT I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT ANY CITY. WHAT DO THE CITY WIDE I THINK A LOT OF TIMES TO PUT YOUR THIS AND THEY ASSUME THAT THEIR NEIGHBORHOOD BAR ON THE CORNER IS GOING TO GO TO FOUR AM -- CITIES WILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO DECIDE THIS THIS WILL ONLY HAPPEN IN ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OR ONE ENTERTAINMENT ZONE -- WE'RE IN A LIMITED AREA AND I THINK MOST CITIES WOULD DO THAT -- CITIES ALSO THE ABILITY TO DECIDE HOW MANY NIGHTS A WEEK OR A YEAR A CITY COULD GO -- SEVEN NIGHTS A WEEK OR ONLY FRIDAY SATURDAY NIGHTS OR ONLY ON SPECIAL OCCASIONS A COUPLE OF NIGHTS A YEAR MAYBE ONLY NEW YEAR'S EVE. I CITIES WILL HAVE THE COMPLETE FLUX HE BASED ON WHAT THE CITY COUNCIL THINGS BASED ON WHAT THE LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT CHP THANK BASED ON WHAT THE LOCAL. OUR COMMUNITY -- THANKS -- COLORS NIGHT LIFE IS VERY IMPORTANT -- IN CALIFORNIA AND PARTICULARLY AND THIS IN CERTAIN CITIES I'M IS A HUGE ECONOMIC GENERATOR IN TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT -- THESE -- OVERWHELMINGLY SMALL BUSINESSES -- THAT ARE OFTEN STRUGGLING ESPECIALLY IN OUR HIGHER COST OF CITIES THIS WILL GIVE THEM MORE FLEXIBILITY AND GIVE WORKERS -- MORE WAGES -- NAY LIFE IS ALSO VERY IMPORTANT FOR THE CULTURE -- OF OUR STATE AND MANY OF OUR CITIES AND HELPS DEFINE. WHAT A CITY IS IN TERMS OF THAT NIGHT LIFE AND PROVIDING CITIES WITH MORE FLEXIBILITY TO DECIDE WHAT WORKS FOR THEM LOCALLY -- MAKES ALL THE SENSE. IN THE WORLD -- I WANT -- TO ALSO JUST -- I THINK IT'S A POINT ALSO UNDERSTAND THIS IS NOT SOME CUTTING EDGE. REVOLUTIONARY PIECE OF LEGISLATION ALMOST HALF OF THE STATES IN THIS COUNTRY. ALLOW LATER THAN TWO AM SERVICE WHETHER IT'S STATE WIDE. OR WHETHER IT IS. A CITY BY CITY -- DECISION SOME STATES IT MIGHT ONLY BE ONE CITY BUT THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT'S THAT WOULD BE BRAND NEW. FRANKLY WE'RE CATCHING UP -- WITH SOME OTHER STATES -- SO -- AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US UP FOR A FEW YEARS NOW -- I WANNA ASK US SOMETHING NUMBER SANTIAGO -- TO SAY A FEW WORDS -- AND THEN WE'LL GO TO OUR WITNESSES WHO WERE BARRED NEW IN THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION -- NICOLO DELUCA -- REPRESENTING THE CITY OF OAKLAND WHICH IS ONE OF THE PILOTS CITIES. THINGS JOURNAL BE BRIEF AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PROMOTION FOR MISTER ROWE SECOND WAS JONES SAWYER REYES SANTIAGO AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THE REST OF THE COMMISSION HELP IN THIS TO MAKE THIS A BETTER BILL EVERYTHING HERE BUT HERE'S THE BOTTOM LINE LIKE IN AREAS LIKE. OURS IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WE'RE GONNA HAVE THE OLYMPICS SO WE HAVE. WHAT WE HAVE DONE A DESTINATION POINT AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ATTRACT -- THE THE THE REVENUE WILL BUILD A CONVENTION CENTER WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE. WITH OTHER CITIES I'M THEIR CITIES WHO DO THIS TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH CITIES TO DO BEFORE -- OR LATER IN THE MORNING SO THE PART OF THIS IS REALLY NAY ECONOMIC ENGINE THE ABILITY TO TO COMPETE AND LOOK IT. YOU TAKE A LOOK TO SEE LOS ANGELES DOESN'T HAVE TO BE DONE EVERYWHERE YOU CAN CHOOSE WHERE WE'RE NOT YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO IT AND IN SOME CASES WHERE YOU HAVE LIKE A STABLE CENTER. AND LET'S SAY YOU WATCH A CONCERT OR SOMETHING AND YOU COME BACK TO YOUR HOTEL ROOM AND YOU CAN'T HAVE DINNER AFTER ONE O'CLOCK IN ORDER A GLASS OF WINE IT MAKES NO SENSE. SOMEONE TO GIVE YOU KIND OF A PRACTICAL POINT OF VIEW AND THERE'S A LOT OF ARGUMENTS ABOUT WHAT -- OR FOLKS THINK THAT THIS IS THE BILL THAT WILL ALLOW PEOPLE TO DRINK -- ALL NIGHT LONG THAT'S NOT REALLY WHAT THIS% IS ABOUT IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BILL THE TALK ABOUT PURE LOCAL CONTROL WERE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY COULD DETERMINE WITH VERY STRICT GUIDELINES AS TO WHEN WHERE AND IF. THEY ALLOW A DRINKING TOLL FOR THE MORNING SOMEBODY CLARIFY THAT -- NOW AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR. THE TIME. HI BURDEN FROM CALIFORNIA TRAVEL ASSOCIATION KNOWN AS CAL TRAVEL WE'RE HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB. FIFTY EIGHT OUR MEMBERS ARE VERY PROUD OF THE EXPERIENCES IN THE SERVICES THAT THEY OFFER -- VISITORS TO CALIFORNIA BUT WE ARE AT A DISADVANTAGE RIGHT NOW AGAINST MANY OTHER -- INTERNATIONAL CITIES IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO IN THE UNITED STATES WHEN WE ROLL UP THE CARPET AT TWO AM. WE REALLY LIKE THIS BILL -- AS A PILOT PROGRAM WITH LOCAL CONTROL TO ALLOW OUR CITIES TO COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY TO ATTRACT VISITORS -- FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD TO ENJOY EVERYTHING THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER -- WE ALSO SEE THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR EXISTING BUSINESSES TO GAIN MORE REVENUE AND PROVIDE MORE SERVICES -- TO TO VISITORS AND ALSO FOR NEW BUSINESSES TO PRODUCT SUPPORT IS FOR EXAMPLE IF WE ARE HAVING A CONCERT THAT STAYING OPEN LATER TO ALLOW FOOD INTO ALLOWED DRINK AFTER IT. TRANSPORTATION SERVICES -- AND AND OTHER ACTIVITIES AROUND THE EXTENDED HOURS WILL HELP THE LOCAL COMMUNITY. IT WILL INCREASE TOURISM REVENUE IT WILL INCREASE JOBS IT WILL INCREASE TAXES SO WE DEFINITELY SUPPORT WE ALSO LIKE THAT IT'S A BALANCED BILL THAT IT IS A PILOT PROGRAM IN THAT IT DOES HAVE LOCAL CONTROL. SO FOR A TRUCE TOURISM'S UNITED VOICE IN THE STATE WE SUPPORT SB FIFTY EIGHT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE NICOLO TO LIVE HERE WE HAVE OF THE MAYOR LIBBY SCHAAF -- REALLY WANTING TO SENATOR FOR INCLUDING US AS FOR THE PILOT -- AS A CENTER SAID THERE'S A LOT OF GUARD RAILS IN THIS BILLS SPECIFICALLY THE CITY COUNCIL HAVE TO PASS A RESOLUTION ALLOWING US TO GO FORWARD -- AND ALSO THE HIGHLY WITH THE SENATOR SAID OAKLAND SPECIFICALLY IT'S BECOME A AN EXPENSIVE TOWN. THE AREA WHERE THE CITY WOULD USES FOR AM. THOR THE WOULD BE AROUND THE FOX THEATER YES A VERY SUCCESSFUL MUSIC CALL WAY MOST OF THE BUSINESSES AROUND OR PARTIAL RESTAURANTS. ALL OWNED BY A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER SO THE EXTRA TWO OURS WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL TO THE BARTENDERS BAR BACKS WAITERS WAITRESSES SUPPORT STAFF. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

SEEING NONE WILL MOVE TO TEST MORE IN OPPOSITION BILL [inaudible] YEAH. CHECK MY GRAY. JERRY GREEN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM THAT ON TO GET A LOT OF THE CULTURE OF THE CALIFORNIA CALL POLICY ONLINE KAPPA. KAPPA STABILIZE MADE UP OF FORTY DIVERSE ORGANIZATIONS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WE FOCUS ON PROTECTING THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS. I AM BORN AND RAISED IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY I ENJOY AND I DO ENGAGE IN THE NIGHT LIFE. FOR OVER TEN YEARS AND I STILL DO. I HAVE EXPERIENCE AND I LIVE IN LA SANTA MONICA LONG BEACH AND MANY MORE CITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. BUT I'VE ALSO SEEN EXCESSIVE USE OF ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. PLENTY USES ACTIVITY VIOLENCE. POOR DECISION MAKING TRAGEDIES BREAKING APART FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES AND LIST GOES ON CAP OPPOSE THE SENATE BILL. FIFTY EIGHT TO EXTEND ON SO AUGUST SERVING HOURS BEYOND TO AGAIN WOULD BE ONLY TOO STRICT ENFORCEMENT LIMIT. LIMITED SEARCH RESOURCES AND COST STRESS ON FIRST RESPONDERS WHO ARE BARELY KEEPING PACE. SHOULD SB FIFTY EIGHT BECOME LAW EARLY MORNING COMMUTE TRAFFIC WILL ONLY BE NEGATIVE IMPACTED. ALONG WITH DO YOU AYE BEING MOST PREVALENT THIS WILL FURTHER EXHAUST LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES. LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL X. EXPRESSED SERIOUS CONSIDERATION TO THE GOVERNOR BROWN. OVER MISTER WEINER SECOND ATTEMPT TO DISTRICT THE PROTECTIONS OF A UNIFORM TWO AM. LAST CALL. GOVERNOR VETOED THE BILL THIS STATEMENT WITHOUT QUESTION. THESE TWO EXTRA HOURS WILL RESULT IN MORE DRINKING THE BUSINESSES AND CITIES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL WILL SEE A GOOD SOURCE OF REVENUE. CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL HOWEVER STRONGLY BELIEVES THAT THIS WILL INCREASE DRINKING AND WHICH LEAD TO MORE DRUNK DRIVING. I BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OF MISCHIEF AND IT FROM ITS MIDNIGHT TO TWO AM WITHOUT ADDING TWO MORE ADDITIONAL MAY HAVE. THE BOY AND BAR BILL HAS BEEN PORTRAYED AS A PILOT PROGRAM. A GOOD PROBABLY BROWN DOES NOT TURN 76% OF CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS INTO A TEST SUBJECT. THE FACT IS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE THE DATA THAT WE NEED THE SCIENCE IS CLEAR ON THE DANGERS THAT KEEPING BARS IN CALIFORNIA OPEN FOR TWO ADDITIONAL HOURS. ALL HARD TO RELATE TO AKA WILL INCREASE. THERE WILL BE MORE CAR WRECKS MORE VIOLENCE SEXUAL ASSAULTS THE SCIENCE RESEARCHING. REACHING THESE CONCLUSIONS IS THE HIGH STANDARDS COMING FROM A TEAM IN THE U. S. CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL CDC. WE NOW HAVE MORE EVIDENCE DAHLE CALL RESEARCH GROUP AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE. RELEASED THE COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS REPORT THAT MAKES. PROJECTIONS ON HOW MUCH THE ADDITIONAL HARM WILL COST THE STATE AFTER THE EXTRA REVENUE OF EXTENDING THE SALES. OUR SUBJECT OF SOME KIND OF SUBJECTED. IT IS CONFIRMED THAT SB FIFTY EIGHT MAKES BACK POLICY I LET ME SAY THIS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. IT DOES NOT MAKE DOLLARS AND IT DOES NOT MAKE SENSE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK PLEASE CONSIDER THE VERY REAL HUMAN CONSEQUENCES. OF MAKING ALCOHOL MORE ACCESSIBLE. VOTE NO ON SB FIFTY EIGHT NIGHT LIFE PROFITS FOR ONLY A FEW AND NOT WORTH THE COST. FOR MANY THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS RAMON COST ALONG -- SPEAKING FOR ALCOHOL JUSTICE SO I AM A TO COMMENT ON THE REPORT WAS RELEASED YESTERDAY BY I'LL CALL JUSTICE -- ANALYZING THE COST OF THE BENEFITS OF S. B. -- VERY CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATING THE COST OF THE BENEFITS OF SB -- FIFTY EIGHT THIS REPORT WAS PUT TOGETHER BY UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA TRADE EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DAVIS TRAINED ECONOMIST AND HERE'S WHAT THEY FOUND. BASICALLY -- IF YOU TAKE ALL THE BENEFITS C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; RECORD BENEFITS&lt;/c&gt;</u> WHICH IS MAINLY TAX REVENUE THAT CAN BE -- ESTIMATED -- THE IF THEY THEY TOOK THE NUMBER OF BARS THERE ARE THE NUMBER -- THAT WOULD STAY OPEN THE NUMBER OF DRINKS TO COULD BE SERVE THE PRICE FOR THOSE DRINKS THE TAXES WOULD BE CHARGE OF THOSE PRICES. AND WHAT THEY CAME UP WITH IS AN ESTIMATE OF THE QUOTE UNQUOTE THE BENEFITS. UP THEY DO NOT LOOK AT EXTRA BUSINESS BECAUSE OF SOMEBODY'S IN A BAR BUYING A DRINK THAT MEANS ARE NOT SOMEWHERE ELSE SPENDING THE MONEY SO IT'S MONEY THAT'S EITHER GOING TO THE BAR OWNER SOMEBODY ELSE IN TOWN -- BUT IT'S THE SAME MONEY AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY HAVE ANY JOBS BECAUSE IT JUST TAKES A JOB AWAY FROM ONE PERSON. TO YOU KNOW SPEND IT AT THE BAR. AND I THINK A MORE INTERESTING POINT IS IT DOESN'T COUNT TOURISM BECAUSE THERE ARE NO ESTIMATES THAT I'VE SEEN ON HOW THIS TOURISM MAGIC WOULD ACTUALLY WORK HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CITIES THAT HAVE VERY MATURE TOURISM INDUSTRIES ALREADY SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES PALM SPRINGS AND OTHER CITIES THE FRANKLY IT'S HARD FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW. SACRAMENTO WAR FRESNO ALREADY BECOME TOURIST MECCA IS JUST BECAUSE OF THIS BILL -- BUT IN ANY EVENT THERE'S NO HARD EVIDENCE THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED BY ANY OF THE POINT TO THIS BILL THE TOURISM IS GOING TO BE BENEFIT. SO THERE'S NO WAY TO CALCULATE ANY KIND OF GAME ON THE OTHER HAND TO CALCULATE THE LOSSES YOU HAVE THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL ESTIMATE. ON WHAT IN DOLLAR TERMS THE HUMAN COSTS ARE THAT IS THE CAR WRECKS THE VIOLENCE THE CRIME ALL THE THAT ARE GOING TO HAPPEN WITH EXTRA PEOPLE DRINKING EXTRA BLUES. AND SO -- TAKING THE ESTIMATES OF THE CDC DOLLAR ESTIMATES OF THE HUMAN HARM THOUGH BECAUSE BY THIS BILL VERSUS THE DOLLAR ESTIMATES OF THE TAX REVENUES AND ANYTHING ELSE THAT COULD BE. CALCULATED WE FIND THAT THERE IS A MAJOR SHORTFALL THE REPORT GIVES YOU THE SHORTFALL FOR THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES -- BUT YOU CAN PROJECT OUT ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S AT LEAST A TWO TO ONE RATIO OF LOS FOR EVERY DOLLAR QUOTA COULD GAIN THROUGH TAX REVENUES. YOU HAVE MORE THAN TWO DOLLARS LOSS TO THE HUMAN TRAGEDIES OF CAR WRECKS CRIMES AND SO FORTH THE RELATED TO THE AFTER DRINKING WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN GRADING AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. I AM RICHARD ZALDIVAR I'M THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE WALL LAST MEMORIALS PROJECT IN LOS ANGELES. I'M ALSO CO CHAIR CAPITAL WHICH IS A CALIFORNIA ALCOHOL POLICY ALLIANCE. AND A SPOKESPERSON UP FOR THE LGBT Q. CAUCUS OF THAT COMMITTEE AND A BOARD MEMBER OF ALL CALL JUSTICE. I ALSO HAVE TO BE TRANSPARENT I'M VERY PROUD -- VOTER IN ROGERS REGISTERED VOTER AND OF THE ASSEMBLYMAN SANTIAGO AND THE ASSEMBLYMAN DOESN'T MAYES IN WORK IN THE COMMUNITY. BUT ON THIS BILL I AM I DISAGREE. I AM ALSO TALKING AS SOMEONE WHO IS A RECOVERING ALCOHOLIC THE THIRTY YEARS. I DID MY FAIR SHARE PARTY AND SO MANY PEOPLE DIED TO THE AIDS CRISIS -- AND THEY CONTRACTED HIV AND AIDS BECAUSE OF INCREASED ALCOHOL AND DRUGS IN THOSE YEARS. MY COMMUNITY CONTINUES TO GET BECOME HIV POSITIVE AND IN AND IN INFECTED WITH SURPLUS THROUGH HI PARTY AND CRYSTAL METH USE. IN ALL THOSE CAPACITY IN CAPACITIES I REPRESENT OPPOSITION TO SB FIFTY EIGHT WELL WE HEAR IT'S AN ECONOMIC ECONOMIC BOOM TO THIS TO THE STATE. TRAVEL INDUSTRY AND TOURISM. AT WHOSE COST. IT STRIPS AWAY UNIFORM PROTECTIONS OF THE STANDARD TO A LAST CALL. IT TURNED 78% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION INTO A SPLASH. SPLASH ZONE LAB. IT EXTENDS OVER CONSUMPTION LOSS OF LIFE VIOLENCE INJURY AND NUISANCE TO EARLY MORNING COMMUTE HOURS. AND IT COSTS THE STATE THREE TO FOUR MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR TO ADMINISTER. COST CITIES AND TOWNS AND SPLASH ZONES TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE TO MITIGATE THE HARMS. IT DISREGARDS FORTY YEARS A PEER ON THE DANGERS OF EXTENDING LAST CALL. AND IT SUBSIDIZES IT REWARDS NIGHTLIFE ALL CALL SALAS AT TEXAS TAXPAYERS. LIKE SPENCE. ACCORDING TO THE CDC OVER TEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED OFF THE WHOLE WORK RELATED DEATHS TAKE PLACE. IT'S GOING TO COST THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL COSTS AND FOURTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION IN STATE COSTS. AS A PERSON OF COLOR. WHO'S WORKING CLASS IN MY COMMUNITY. AND A LARGE METROPOLITAN AREAS AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDERSERVED ARE AT RISK [inaudible] AT RISK. AKA HOLISM AT RISK OF DRUG. OVERDOSES AT RISK FOR PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES. SO WE SHOULD NOT LOOK AT THIS AS ECONOMIC BOOM TO THE STATE. BECAUSE THE STATE'S NOT GONNA PAY FOR THOSE WHO DIE.

OKAY WE HAVE ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION AT THIS TIME. SEE NINE WILL GO AHEAD AND BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS WHICH LACKEY [inaudible] YES CERTAINLY. I DON'T BELIEVE THE AUTHOR THIS BILL IS INTENDED BUT COUNTLESS LIVES IN DANGER BUT THAT WILL BE THE BIGGEST MY PRODUCT OF THIS LEGISLATION. I FEEL UNIQUELY QUALIFIED AND I FEEL SOMEWHAT RESPONSIBLE TO SPEAK. TO THIS ISSUE. AND TO TRY TO CONTROL MY EMOTIONS BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY PERSONAL LIFE FROM MY EXPERIENCES TWENTY EIGHT YEARS THE CALIFORNIA HIGHWAY PATROL. TWENTY OF THOSE TWENTY EIGHT YEARS WERE SPENT WORKING ABOUT THESE HOURS IN QUESTION. THE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR AM. LET ME JUST SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE. NUMBERS OF VERIFY WHAT I'M ABOUT READY TO SHARE WITH YOU. THE NATIONAL HIGHWAY TRAFFIC SAFETY ADMINISTRATION IS SHOWN THE 54% OF CRASHES. THAT HAPPEN BECAUSE OF ALCOHOL IMPAIRMENT ARE AT OR AFTER TWO AM. SIMILAR TO IT SIMILARLY THEY FOUND THAT THE DEADLIEST TIMES TO DRIVE. ARE WE TO IN MIDNIGHT AND THREE AM WHICH RESULT IN NEARLY ONE POINT TWO MILLION DRIVERS BEING INJURED OR KILLED. DURING THOSE TIMES. THERE MAY BE I'M I'M NOT HERE TO ARGUE THE FISCAL BENEFITS -- BUT THE HUMAN COST. I WITNESSED WITH MY OWN EYES. AND I'VE I'VE WALKED IN THE HOMES OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST LOVED ONES AND HAD TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION THAT. THEIR LOVED ONES ARE NOT COMING HOME BECAUSE SOMEONE DROVE IMPAIR. AND I COULD TELL YOU YOU HERE'S ANOTHER THING THAT MANY PEOPLE MAY NOT REALIZE. THE BETWEEN TWO AND FOUR AM YOU HAVE A FATIGUE MULTIPLIER. AND I'VE I'VE ARRESTED OVER. THOUSANDS. AND IMPAIR DRIVERS IN MY IN MY CAREER. VERY VERY FEW OF THEM A NOD TO REALIZE THAT THEY ARE IMPAIRED. THAT IS OUR BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH BILLS LIKE THIS. BECAUSE THEY'RE GOING TO DRIVE FOLKS. EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE ALL THESE GREAT PROGRAMS WE HAVE LEFT AND WE HAVE UBER WE HAVE. DESIGNATED DRIVER PROGRAMS AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT HELP REDUCE. FACT REMAINS IF THIS BILL GOES IN. TO AFFECT THERE WILL BE. PEOPLE DIE. BECAUSE DIRECTLY BECAUSE OF THIS POLICY BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE PERMITTED. TO MAKE BAD CHOICES. IF YOU'RE COMFORTABLE WITH CASTING A VOTE IN FAVOR OF THAT YOU THINK DIFFERENTLY THAN I DO. I WOULD ASK THAT YOU STRONGLY CONSIDER THE REALITY OF WHAT THIS WILL DO. AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY. WHICH COOPER NOT A GOOD TO RESPECT THE SENATOR HE'S PROBABLY THE HARDEST WORKING MEMBER THIS LEGISLATURE THAT WORKS THE BILLS AND MY ONLY CONCERNS ARE. THAT YOUR GRAVEYARD IF YOU DON'T KNOW FOR GRAVEYARD THAT'S A LOW STAFFING FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT MATTER WHERE YOU WORK SURE OF C. H. P. R. PD SLOWEST AFRICA'S MOST PEOPLE IN BED. SOLDIER LOWEST NUMBERS INFERENCES IN SACRAMENTO FOR C. H. P. THE AMERICAN MEMBERS OF VIOLENT SELF THE RIVER YOU HAVE TO TWO MEN UNITS AND ONE SUPERVISOR. NORTH THE RIVER TWO TWO MENUS AND WHAT'S PROVIDES WRONG GRAVEYARD SO IF YOU TO CRASH A TIED UP IF YOU BOOK SOMEBODY THE COUNTY JAIL. YOU'RE TALKING YOU DOWN THERE FOR A COUPLE HOURS OFF THE STREETS. SO AND LET ALONE JUST NORMAL ACCIDENTS AND THINGS SO IT'S IT'S REALLY TIME INTENSIVE ON GRAVEYARD LEVEL SOMETHING BAD HAPPENING TO BE OFTEN WHILE SHOOTING. YOU'RE GONNA PULL WATER UNITS IN. AND THEN FOR YOUR CITIES I MEAN LAW ENFORCEMENT'S INCLUDED BUT THE CITY GOVERNMENT BOB THIS FIFTEEN YEARS THE MAYOR AND COUNCIL MEMBER AND ECONOMIC. NO DRIVERS TRUMP. PUBLIC SAFETY THE IN THE DAY THAT POLICE CHIEF. WORKS FOR THE CITY MANAGER CITY COUNCIL SO THAT THERE'S SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT I'M I'M NOT TO BE VOTING THE BILL TODAY ON A WITHHOLD MY VOTING WAY FOR THE FOR BUT THERE'S SOME REAL THING TO THINK ABOUT. AND THINK ABOUT FOR THE MORNING AUTHORS HAVE REPORTS THEY TO GET OFF IT SIX OR SEVEN THE MORNING. TO TRY TO FINISH REPORTS AND MAYBE. BLOOD GO TO SHOP SOMEWHERE COFFEE SHOP OFFICIALS REPORTS -- THEY MAKE A RESCUE ONE OVERTIME SO THEY'RE ONE OF THE ISSUE I THINK WE'RE FOR SAN FRANCISCO I THINK IT'S GREAT BECAUSE SEVEN HELLO FOLKS. IT'S A SMALL CITY NOT A BIG CITY IT'S ALL IT'S COMPACT POLITICAL TAKE PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION THERE BUT THE AVERAGE UBER RIDE IS ABOUT SEVEN MILES. AND CERTAINLY A LOT OF FOLKS COMMUTE FROM THE SUBURBS GIVE DOWNTOWN OFFICE LIVE DOWNTOWN BELOW FOLD COMMUTING FROM THE SUBURBS NEAR DRIVING ON THE FREEWAY IS AND WE TALK ABOUT A NUMBER C. S. P. OFFICERS. YOU THINK ABOUT IT THERE'S NOT A LOT OUT THERE. YES YOU'RE DOWNTOWN SEE IF YOU'RE SEXUALLY MAY BUST YOU. THERE CONSTRUED IN IN THE CITY IN THE MID TOWN AREA BUT ALSO THAT THEY THEY REALLY AREN'T SO AWFUL TO DRIVING IN FROM ELK GROVE RANCHER GLOBAL FULL SINCE THE TWO SIDES A LOT OF HILLS. AND LA IS THE SAME THING A LOT OF FOLKS ARE DRIVING BY DRIVING INTO THE DOWNTOWN AREA DELAYED A PARTY. SO THAT'S THAT THAT IS A REAL ISSUE WITH THAT HAVING MADE ARREST SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT SACRAMENTO. HAVING MADE ARREST FOR DRUNK DRIVERS IN DEALING WITH THAT. IN BEING A COMMANDER RECOMMENDED DIVISION FOR THE SOUTH THERE IN PATROL. AND WE STAFF GRAVEYARD THE THAT'S A LUIS STAFFING DAY SHIFT A SECOND LOWEST AND FINISH IT HAS THE MOST BECAUSE WILSHIRE COMING HOME FROM WORK AND DOING THINGS SO THAT'S HOUSE STAFFING WORKS. YOU CAN ACTUALLY TO STAFFING CIVIL TOOLS ARE MY CONCERNS I HAVE A GREAT RESPECT FROM THE AUTHOR AND IT'S JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT IS NOT. EXCESSIVE CISCO IT WORKS ABSOLUTELY BUTTONS IN THE SUBURBS PEOPLE ARE GONNA. GO OUT AND DRIVE AND IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S HARD IT'S HARD. ADDITIONAL COMMENTS QUESTION CONSERVE MISTER GIPSON. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WERE ALSO THANK THE SENATOR FOR AGAIN TACKLING THIS ISSUE I KNOW THIS IS -- BROUGHT IT BACK. THE SECOND TIME I BELIEVE. THIRD THIRD TIME -- AND I KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER QUESTIONS OF LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO. ALSO WAS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL. CAN THIS IS -- ONCE ONCE ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL THIS ONE YOU'RE TO TOUCH BASES ON ABOUT THE LOCAL CONTROL COMPONENT TO THIS. FORMING AND HOW LONG I MAY HAVE MISSED IT. AND I DON'T SEE ABOUT HOW LONG IS A PILOT PROGRAM GOING TO LAST -- FOR AND SO MUCH ANSWER THOSE TWO QUESTIONS THAT I MAY HAVE ANOTHER. ONE IN A FOLLOW UP. YEAH THANK YOU -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SEES ME -- THANK YOU SOME OF HER -- FOR THOSE QUESTIONS AND I WILL START BY SAYING YOU KNOW I TO BOTH OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO JUST -- EXPRESSED A LACK OF SUPPORT FOR THE BILL AYE AYE THE FEELING'S MUTUAL RESPECT TO BOTH COMMAND THIS LAND I RESPECT THE WORK THAT YOU'VE DONE. IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND PUBLIC SAFETY IS ABSOLUTELY ONE ASPECT. OF THIS ISSUE AND THIS BILL AND OUT TO OUR WE WORKED WITH C. H. P. AND WE WORKED WITH THE POLICE CHIEF THIS IS. TWO YEARS AGO AND THEY ASK FOR AMENDMENTS THAT WE PUT INTO THE BILL IN THOSE MOMENTS OF NEVER CHANGE IN THE BILL. TO MANDATE THAT BOTH CHT AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT BE INVOLVED IN THE PLANNING PROCESS -- AND THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WHEN THEY MADE THAT REQUEST TO MADE ALL THE SENSE IN THE WORLD TO ME BECAUSE LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE -- OKAY IT IS ONE ASPECT OF THIS IMPORTANT ASPECT IT'S NOT THE ONLY ASPECT. NIGHT LIFE IS NOT I THINK SOMETIMES WE TEND TO VIEW NIGHT LIFE ONLY AND THE NEGATIVE -- AND IT'S NOT JUST AROUND DRIVING WHEN PEOPLE SAY OH THE PERSON WAS STUMBLING DOWN THE STREET -- URINATED ON MY FRONT PORCH AND PEOPLE LOOK AT THE NEGATIVE. AND THE POSITIVE ABOUT NIGHT LIFE GETS COMPLETELY LOST -- IT IN THE SHUFFLE AND THERE ARE AND WE HAVE TO TRY TO MITIGATE THE NEGATIVE AND WE DO THAT IN THIS BILL -- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE TO NIGHT LIFE IS ONE THERE'S A REASON WHY SO MANY PEOPLE [inaudible] GO OUT. WHY PEOPLE GO OUT AND ENJOY THEMSELVES AND WHY PEOPLE WANT TO BE ABLE TO GO OUT -- AT A TIME THAT IS NOT HOW WE DO IT RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE PEOPLE WHO GET OFF WORK AT MIDNIGHT. AND THEY CAN'T GO OUT NOW THERE'S NO WAY THEY CAN GO BACK HOME AND CHANGE OR GO OUT BY. TWO NOT EVERYONE WORKS IN NINE TO FIVE JOB WORKS WHAT WE'RE CONSIDERED TRADITIONAL SCHEDULE SO THIS IS SIMPLY PROVIDING FLEXIBILITY AND YES THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOCAL DECISION FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR THE LOCAL. I. CITY COUNCIL IT IS A FIVE YEAR PILOT PROGRAM THAT WAS AND THEN WE TOOK IN THIS COMMITTEE. TWO YEARS AGO INITIALLY IT WAS PERMANENT IT WAS STATE WIDE. AND PERMANENT. AND WE WENT DOWN TO A FIVE YEAR PILOT IN THIS COMMITTEE AND THE NEXT YEAR WILL REINTRODUCE THE BILL WOULD LIMIT IT. ONLY TO CITIES WHO HAVE TOLD US THAT THEY WANT TO BE AND IN ADDITION THE FIVE YEARS DOESN'T START ON JANUARY FIRST AND THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE MAD AT ME. FOR NOT STARTING AT JANUARY FIRST WHAT WE AGREED WITH WITH WITH THIS COMMITTEE TWO YEARS AGO AND IT'S STILL IN THE BILL. IS THERE IS A TWO YEAR RAMP UP PERIOD TO GIVE COMMUNITY SO THE COMMUNITIES DON'T FEEL RUSHED TO DO THE PLAN AND WE DON'T WANT IT TO BE -- WE HAVE FIVE YEARS AND IF WE TAKE OUR TIME TO DO PLANNING IS GOING TO EAT AWAY AT THE FIVE YEARS WE GIVE A TWO YEAR RAMP UP SO THAT THEY THEY CAN DO THAT METHODICAL PLANNING AROUND PUBLIC SAFETY. AROUND TRANSPORTATION PASSER ORDINANCE IF THEY CHOOSE TO DO SO GIVE ABC TIME TO REVIEW THE ORDINANCE AND SO FORTH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WHAT ARE THE CITY'S -- HOW IS NEW YORK AND OTHER ONES WHO HAVE THE SIMILAR PROVISIONS -- TODAY'S HERE DEMANDED THAT I'M NOT SURE ANY A SPIKE IN TERMS OF DO YOU EYES OR ACCIDENTS OR THINGS OF THAT NATURE WELL -- SO A COUPLE THINGS -- THERE ARE -- WE HAD -- AND WE DID THIS TWO YEARS AGO WE GAVE IT TO THE COMMITTEE -- WE TOOK ALL FIFTY STATES AND LOOKED AT AND COMPARE CLOSING TIME TO RATES OF DO YOU Y. COLLISIONS -- AND THERE IS ABSOLUTELY ZERO CORRELATION THERE WERE SOME OF THE EARLIEST CLOSING TIME STATES. THAT HAD HIGH LEVELS OF THE WIVES AND SOME OF THE LATEST ONES THAT HAVE LOWER LEVELS -- AND SO I DON'T THINK I I DON'T THINK IT'S ACCURATE -- TO SUGGEST THAT THERE'S SOMEHOW THIS JUST EXACT CORRELATION AND AND WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE. ON PORTS AND I SAY THIS AS SOMEONE WHO AND I'VE SAID THIS TO THIS COMMITTEE REPORT IS A HARD THING TALK ABOUT WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. MY AUNT MY FATHER'S ONLY SIBLING WAS KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER -- IT HAS RACKED OUR FAMILY FOR YEARS IT STILL SOME AS WITH US TODAY THIS IS AN ISSUE I TAKE VERY VERY SERIOUSLY. AND SHE WAS KILLED -- IN THE EARLY EVENING -- THAT WE KNOW THAT. THE BAR IS A NIGHT CLUBS ARE NOT THE ONLY SOURCES OF ALCOHOL LATIMES WE'RE GOING TO LIQUOR STORES LIQUOR STORES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THIS BILL THEY WERE EXCLUDED. FROM THIS BILL -- AND SO -- WE ARE WHEN IT COMES TO TO DO YOU EYES -- YOU KNOW WE WE KNOW THAT IT IS THAT THERE ARE ALREADY ALMOST HALF THE STATES ALLOW. STATE WIDER LOCALLY LATER SERVICE TIME -- WE DON'T THINK THE EVIDENCE IS THERE THERE IS THIS REPORT THAT ALCOHOL JUSTICE JUST RELEASE IT'S AN ALCOHOL JUSTICE REPORT THIS IS NOT SOME INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY. PUTTING OUT THE REPORT THE POINT OF THIS BILL DID ITS OWN REPORT AND RELEASED IT. THE BULK OF THE DATA IN THIS REPORT IS FROM NETHERLANDS AND ICE LAND AND AUSTRALIA AND CANADA THIS ONE PIECE FROM NEW YORK. BUT THE REST IS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES NO OFFENSE THESE ARE ALL WONDERFUL COUNTRIES BUT TO SUGGEST THAT CALIFORNIA IS COMPARABLE TO NETHERLANDS OR ICELAND -- I THINK DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. LET ME SAY THAT YOU KNOW. I HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- AND I AM PERPLEXED UP INTO TERMS OF YOU KNOW -- WE KNOW THE WORK STREAMING HARD -- THIS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL -- EVERY CITY AND CALIFORNIA'S NOT GIVEN THE CARB LUNCH TO TO OPERATE BETWEEN AT EIGHT BY EXTENDED HOURS -- YOU HAVE IN FACT WORK WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AS I UNDERSTAND -- AND YOU'VE GOTTEN SOME AGREEMENTS THAT'S WHY WE IS REFLECTED IN OF THE ITEMS WE HAVE BEFORE US TODAY -- I'M WELCOME TO HEAR FROM MY OTHER COLLEAGUES ON THIS MATTER AND SO -- MILLER RESERVE AND WE CAN SEE SEE WAS GOING. SEWER THINGS ARE. WHICH COOPER I WANT TO FOLLOW UP ON THE MEMBER FROM CARSON'S COMMENTS IN TERMS LIKE NEW YORK IS YOUR PEOPLE USE A SUBWAY. IT'S A DANCE POP DISLEY POPULOUS CITY SO IT'S A IT'S WITH APPLE AND ORANGES COMPARISON. AND YOU KNOW IT COMES DOWN. I MEAN TO MONEY. AND JUST LIKE C. H. P. AND ASSIST PLEASE INCLUDED. BUT BILL CITIES DON'T PAY LESS THESE P. AUTHOR SALLY THE STATE DOES. THE CHP IS NOT HAVE INCREASING MEMBERS AND IN NUMBERS AND GOT TEN YEARS I KNOW SOMETHING FRASIER'S RUN MULTIPLE BILLS TO TRY AND GET. ADDITIONAL SEIZE P. AUTHORS ADDED TO C. H. P. THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE WITHOUT EVEN GOVERNOR SO THAT MAY CHANGE SO. IN MOST FOLKS TAKE THE FREEWAYS SO THOSE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE PT'S. SUREST JOBS NOT TRAFFIC BY THE WAY THEY MAY DO IT SOMETIMES BUT THIS OTHER PRIMARY JOB SO IN THOSE LOCAL PLEASE THAT'S FINE BUT THOSE FOLKS. ARE GONNA GET THE FREEWAYS AND DRY THE FREEWAY. THAT'S REALLY AN ISSUE WITH THAT NOT HAVE MORE OFFICERS NUMBER. ONE IT GOES BACK TO THIS IS A TEN CITY PILOT SO YOU HAVE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO CITIES IN THE GERMAN FROM OAKLAND. THEY BECOME YOUR CITY TO GET DRINKS BUT THEIR DRIVE IT OUT OF THE BAY AREA FOR OTHER CITIES. SO DRIVERS OTHER CITIES THAT DON'T HAVE ANY. SAY SO -- IN IN THE MATTER SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT COMES DOWN TO I THINK THEY CAN DO IS THE POPULOUS CITIES WERE. A LOT OF FOLKS ARE DRIVING THIS WORKS ABSOLUTELY BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE VEHICLE HEAVY. HELLO FOLKS CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE IN THE CITIES SO THAT'S WHAT THE COMMUTER FROM THE SUBURBS AND THAT THAT WAS A REAL REALISTIC ISSUE SO. IT'S HAVING FUN FIGURE THIS OUT MAKE THIS WORK. THIS BLOOD TEST. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- STE SENATOR I FIRST WANT TO SAY THAT -- YOU KNOW I COMMEND YOU ON YOUR TENACITY WITH THIS BILL THIS IS THE THIRD DID YOU SAY THIRD THIRD TRY. YES I WAS VETO LAST YEAR OKAY SO. I I MEAN I THINK YOU CLEARLY ARE VERY SERIOUS ABOUT THIS FISHING YOU BELIEVE IN THIS POLICY -- BUT I WILL SAY THAT THE COMMENTS FROM MY THREE COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE SERVED IN LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD -- GIVE EVERYONE PIES -- IT'S NOT ALL ABOUT ECONOMICS OF COURSE DON'T I UNDERSTAND THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IN ANY COMMUNITY TO HAVE THESE EXTENDED HOURS AND LONGER HOURS FOR PEOPLE TO WORK BY. I DO THINK THAT THE WITNESSES BRING UP A GOOD POINT WHICH IS AT WHAT COST -- WE KNOW THAT IN SOME OF THE CITIES THE D. Y. HAVE GONE UP SOME HAVE GONE DOWN IT SEEMS TO BURY THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE A RHYME OR REASON WITH THAT. BUT WHAT WE ALSO NOW IS THAT -- HIT AND RUNS YOU KNOW OUR UP AS WELL SO IN THE CITIES ARE MORE. YOU KNOW COMPACT WHERE YOU MAY NOT HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE DRIVING BUT MORE PEOPLE WALKING I THINK YOU ADD. TO THAT EQUATION THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO MAY VERY WELL FIND THEMSELVES GETTING HIT BY A CAR BECAUSE ARE STUMBLING YOU KNOW INTO THE STREET OR MINUTES A WHOLE HOST OF SCENARIOS HERE THAT WE CAN GET. BUT SUFFICE TO SAY THAT -- TWO MONTHS AGO -- WE BURIED CHP OFFICER STEVE LIKE ON HE WAS HAD BY SOMEONE WHO IS DRUNK. I DON'T WANT TO SEE THOSE AGAIN I KNOW YOU DON'T EITHER. AND I SEE THIS POLICY IS SOMETHING THAT. IS GOING TO ADD. TO THAT ISSUE RATHER THAN IMPROVE IT. I'M ALL FOR HAVING A DRINK. BACK TO YOU AND I CAN GO HOW AND WHEN WE'RE DONE HERE. BUT I DON'T SEE THE HELP AND EXTENDING THE NUMBER OF HOURS OR PEOPLE CAN GO OUT AND DRINK TOO MUCH AND THEN GET ON THE ROAD. AND TAKE SOMEONE'S LIFE MY DAUGHTERS OR YOU. OR ANOTHER CHP OFFICER I THINK THE NUMBER OF HOURS DURING WHICH ONE CAN DRINK IN A TWENTY FOUR APPEARED IN CALIFORNIA -- IS ENOUGH SO I'M SORRY BUT I CAN'T SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISSION JONES SORT. AND AND I ALSO WANT TO COMPLIMENT YOU ON YOUR TO NASA THE ON ON THIS BILL AND LOOK -- IN THIS COUNTRY AS A WHOLE. HAS HAD A HARD HARD -- PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL -- IF YOU ALL GOALIE BACK EVEN TO THE TEMPERANCE PROHIBITION TIME. WHERE WOMEN? MAINLY BECAUSE OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE BECAUSE OF DRINKING. DURING THAT TIME PEOPLE USED TO VOTE IN BARS. IT WOULD HAVE MEETINGS AND AND DRINKING WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS JUST DONE AT WORK ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND AS A COUNTRY. WE DECIDED THAT MAY BE THE SOLUTION WOULD BE TO BAN ALL ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. WHICH LEAD. TO PROHIBITION. WHICH DIDN'T LEAD TO RISE OF SPEAKEASY'S UNDERGROUND DRINKING IT DIDN'T STOP. IN SOME INSTANCES IT PROBABLY MADE IT WORSE THE MORE YOU PROHIBIT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T GET TO THE WHOLE ROUTE. OF ALCOHOLISM -- IT'S NOT THE BAR THREE ALCOHOL [inaudible] AND FOR ME -- IT'S REALLY ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL SOME GLAD YOU. EXPLAINED THAT -- FOR ME I'VE BEEN TO LOUISIANA -- I'VE BEEN IN THE WORLD'S WHEN YOU GET OFF THE WHEN YOU GET OFF THE PLANE. EVEN DRIVE TO ADAPT REPLACE IN YOUR CAR. AND GET A DRINK. AND I KNOW THAT IN LOUISIANA THEY'VE EVEN HAD TO HAVE PROHIBITION BASED ON FEDERAL REGULATIONS TO PROHIBIT A LOT OF THE DRINKING THAT'S GOING ON HERE -- YOU MAY HAVE BEEN A LITTLE OUT OF OUR CONTROL BUT STE. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL YOU HAVE CITIES AYE BATON ROUGE? THAT DOESN'T. ALLOW DRINKING. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ANYONE IS CONFINED TO A CERTAIN PLACE SO I TRULY BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL ESPECIALLY SOMEONE FROM SOUTH LOS ANGELES. WHERE WE DIDN'T APPLY GOOD? RULES AND REGULATIONS WHICH CONTRIBUTE -- TO PROLIFERATION OF LIQUOR STORES IN MY CAN BE -- AND THAT'S WITH EIGHT TWO AM ONE THIRTY TWO AM -- PROHIBITION AND SO WE NEVER REALLY STOPPED -- FROM DRINKING -- A DRINKING AFTER HOURS AND YOU SEE SOME OF THAT DATA GOES BEYOND THAT TIME. AND SO FOR ME -- WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS? IS THIS WHOLE CONCEPT OF LOCAL CONTROL -- I DON'T EXPECT. THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES. ESPECIALLY I KNOW TO COUNSEL PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT. PROBABLY WILL FORBID ANY. TWENTY FOUR SEVEN OR FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING DRINKING THEY'RE NOT. DO NOT ALLOW THAT IN THE RESTAURANTS AND AND NEIGHBORHOOD BARS IN MY COMMUNITY. NOW IN MISTER SANTIAGO STATISTIC WHERE HE IS WE INVITE MAKES SENSE BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF HOTELS WHERE PEOPLE CAN GO BACK AND FORTH THAT HE CAN GET. TO THE HOTEL TRAVELING ON DISNEY BECAUSE A LOT OF TOURISM. IT PROBABLY WILL MAKE MORE SENSE I'M ALSO. I ALSO BELIEVE THAT THE LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL. WE'LL PUT IN ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS OR ADDITIONAL -- REQUIREMENTS ON THE RESTAURANTS AND BARS. THIS CONCEPT THAT BARTENDERS OR RESTAURANTS OR JUST GONNA. GET PEOPLE. LOOKING TO GET DRUNK. AND THEN GIVEN MORE LIQUOR SO TO GET DRUNK -- AND THEN HAVE MANY CARS MY UNDERSTANDING ON JUST LIABILITY TO THAT WHICH I THINK LOOK RESTAURANTS HAVE OBSERVED. AND WILL CONTINUE HIS OR AND IF THEY DON'T I THINK. THESE MUNICIPALITIES THAT HAVE VOLUNTEERED FOR THIS WILL ENSURE THAT -- SOME REGULATIONS ARE ARE ARE DONE -- MY MY KIDS FOR ARE IN YOUR TWENTIES TODAY. THEY SCARE ME SOMETIME BECAUSE A YOUNG IN A DAY DRINKING A COUPLE TIMES I'VE CALLED ME IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT. DRAMA AND I'M SHOULD ALL MY GOD WHAT THE HECK I'LL COME PICK YOU UP AND DEL SHAMPOO BORDER LIFT. I SEE WHAT I'LL COME GET YOUR CAR HE SAID WE UBER LIFT HERE. WE KNEW WE NEED PROBABLY NEED TO GET OVER LIFT BACK SO IT IS ALSO ANOTHER GENERATION. UP PEOPLE THAT WHEN WE WERE YOUNGER. PROBABLY. TRACK A COUPLE TIMES TOO MUCH IN DOWN THE ROAD WHEN WE SHOULD OF THIS GENERATION IS A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT. AND SO -- WITH THIS PILOT PROGRAM -- I'M HOPING THAT WE ALSO LOOK AT THE DATA WITH THIS. LOOK AT THE POLICIES THAT THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES COME UP WITH. WHICH WAS HOPEFULLY HELP REDUCE. THE AMOUNT OF ACCIDENTS. AFTER HOURS THAT THEY COME UP WITH SOME POLICIES THAT ULTIMATELY WILL ASSUAGE A LOT OF THE NAY SAYERS AN OPPONENT. AND SO THAT WE MOVE FORWARD. BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP PEOPLE FROM DRINKING. BUT WE CAN PUT IN PLACE. POLICY ORDINANCES WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL REDUCE THAT AND SO I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY. SO THAT WE CAN MOVE FORWARD BECAUSE I THINK WHAT YOU'RE DOING -- AS ANOTHER COMPONENT THAT WE'RE NOT THINKING ABOUT WHICH IS WE COULD ULTIMATELY SAVE SOME LIVES WE DO THIS CORRECTLY [inaudible] THIS LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR SHARING THIS AND WIENER FOR BRING THIS YET AGAIN -- I JUST IN A BIT DISAPPOINTED THAT SAN JOSE IS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS SAYS -- YOU KNOW AS WE'VE SPOKEN ABOUT THIS BECAUSE MANY FROM THE COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT WAS BROUGHT UP WITH RESPECT TO THE LGBT COMMUNITY IN THE FIFTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF THE STONEWALL RIOTS IN WHICH THIS ESTABLISHMENT AT THE STONE OFTEN OCCURRED FOR PLACE OF GATHERING. IS VERY IMPORTANT AS WE SPOKEN BEFORE MAC OF THE LABOR THE POINT BUT INDIVIDUALS CURRENTLY WILL GO ORDER LEVIN THIRTY JUST POUND ON THOSE DRINKS WHEN LAST CALLS AT ONE THIRTY SO. HELLO I BELIEVE THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT EFFORT TO HELP ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE TYPE OF PROTECTIONS AND A FLEXIBLE IT AS NEEDED. AND WITH THE SPECIFIC LOCAL CONTROL ON THE ISSUES THAT WE HAVE AT HAND SO WITH THAT -- I WILL WITH THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION FOR MR Là. GONNA RETURN TO RICHER LACKEY FOR ADDITIONAL. YEAH JUST REAL QUICKLY I WOULD JUST WANTED TO ADD THE POINT WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE FACT YOU REACHED OUT TO THE HIGHWAY PATROL WHICH IS COMMENDABLE BECAUSE I THINK THEY WOULD LIKE TO MITIGATE. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT CURRENTLY IN THE YOU KNOW OR I CAN STAY SAFE WITH ANY KIND OF ASSURANCE WHAT THEIR POSITION IS ON THIS BILL -- BECAUSE I CAN'T TAKE A POSITION BECAUSE OUR STATE EMPLOYEES. BUT I CAN TELL YOU THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE MUCH BUSIER -- IF THIS BILL DOES PASS AND IT IT WILL BE IN DEALING WITH -- WITH TRAGEDY AND AS WE TALK ABOUT. LOCAL CONTROL AND WHAT THAT MEANS. YOUR POLICY. POLICY THE THE CREATES ACCESS. THAT WILL LEAD TO TRAGEDY. SHOULD BE STOPPED WHETHER TO THE LOCAL LEVEL OR WHETHER IT'S AT OUR LEVEL AND SO I WILL SPEAK IS ADAMANTLY AS I CAN AGAINST US BECAUSE I THINK. IT WILL LEAD TO NEEDLESS DEATH AND I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT POINT THAT CH P. DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS MEASURE -- NOR DOES IT OPPOSE [inaudible] ADDITIONAL COMMENTS [inaudible] QUESTIONS CONCERNS. WELL SENATOR -- OBVIOUSLY YOU INSPIRED A ROBUST DEBATE. HERE TODAY AND QUITE A FEW. CONCERNS DOTS SOME SUPPORT SOME OPPOSITION YOUR BILL. I APPRECIATE AS WELL THE THOROUGH APPROACH YOU TAKE ASSOCIATION I KNOW WHEN YOU FIRST BROADCAST. BROUGHT THIS BEFORE OUR COMMITTEE. TO COUPLE YEARS AGO. YOU HAD GOTTEN OUT OF THE SENATE WITH NO AMENDMENTS. AND I THINK WE TOOK NINETEEN AMENDMENTS THAT FIRST YEAR JUST MAKE AMENDMENTS THAT I THINK WE BOTH AGREE -- MAKE THE BILL A BETTER BILL -- THAT STRENGTH -- COMPONENTS AS IT RELATES TO PUBLIC SAFETY LOCAL CONTROL IMPLEMENTATION. I STRUGGLE WITH THE ISSUE THERE ARE SOME. CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED HERE THAT. ARE LEGITIMATE. CONCERNS ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE FACT THAT ALCOHOL HAS ON OUR COMMUNITIES [inaudible] ALTHOUGH. I WOULD CONCUR WITH MISTER JOHN SEARCH COMMENTS IN THAT. AT ONE POINT THIS COUNTRY WE WE BANNED ALCOHOL AND THE RESULTS OF THAT PUBLIC POLICY EXPERIMENT. WE'RE NOT GOOD. WE HAVE STATES THAT SERVE ALCOHOL TELL TWO AM WE HAVE STREET IT'S A SERVE ALCOHOL TELL FOR HIM -- WE HAVE TWENTY FOUR HOUR ALCOHOL. YOU KNOW THROUGHOUT THE WORLD -- THEIR COUNTRIES WHERE THEY TAKE TWELVE HOUR WINDOWS OF THE CHOOSING -- SO I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE PERFECT PURCHASE. ALTHOUGH I KNOW THIS IS A BETTER BILL HAVING COMPANIES COMMITTEE AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE WORKED HARD TO TAKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS INTO CONSIDERATION. AND I ALSO KNOW THAT THIS INSTITUTION LEGISLATURE'S NOT ALWAYS. CONSISTENT IN THE APPLICATION OF OUR IDEOLOGIES. YEAH WE WE HAD BILLS THIS YEAR THIS COMMITTEE. TO BAN FLAVORED -- TOBACCO. AT THE SAME TIME WE'VE CONSIDERED BILLS TO EXPAND THE ACCESS TO FLAVORED MARIJUANA WE DEBATE THE MERITS OF AN EXTENSION OF TWO HOURS AND ACCESS TO A MIND ALTERING. SUBSTANCE LIKE ALCOHOL BUT WE HAVE DOZENS OF OTHER BILLS. TO AGAIN MAKE MARIJUANA ACCESSIBLE THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO I'M NOT SURE WE HAVE A CONSISTENT APPROACH I KNOW WE HAVE A THOROUGH APPROACH IN THIS BILL HERE AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE GONNA HAVE MY SUPPORT TODAY TAKES INTO CONSIDERATION LOCAL CONTROL -- IT HAS SIGNIFICANT -- AMENDMENTS TO INSURE THE PARTICIPATION AS YOU NOTED OF PUBLIC SAFETY -- AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AND YOUR WILLINGNESS -- TO COMPROMISE AND ULTIMATELY I THINK IT A BETTER BILL WE HAVE A MOTION. FOR MISTER LOW.

MISTER CHAIR WE YOU HAVE AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE IF WE HAVE -- MR GRAY'S WITNESSES IF YOU WANNA COME ON UP TO THE TABLE AND I TAKE A SEAT MR GRAY. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. WHEN ASKED AUTHORS EARLIER THIS YEAR? TO HOLD THEIR BILLS RELATED TO THE RISE OF E. CIGARETTE USE AMONGST KIDS AND TEENS. I CONVEYED A SERIES. A WORKING GROUND EXCUSE ME I CONVENE A SERIES OF WORKING GROUND GROUP MEETINGS TO HELP US GET BETTER EDUCATED ON THIS ISSUE. DEVELOP SERIOUS AND MEANINGFUL RESPONSE TO THE EPIDEMIC. MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSE MET NUMEROUS TIMES A BROAD NUMBER PERSPECTIVES AND PRIORITIES TO THE TABLE. WE ALSO MET WITH REPRESENTATIVES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE CONTROL. NEVER TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT THE FORSMAN TOBACCO EDUCATION LOOKS LIKE ON THE GROUND. THROUGHOUT THESE CONVERSATIONS IT BECAME CLEAR THAT THERE IN FACT A NUMBER OF AREAS WHERE WE HAVE. BROAD AGREEMENT. STRICTER RULES TO HOLD TOBACCO LICENSEES ACCOUNTABLE FOR UNDERAGE SALES. MANDATORY STING OPERATIONS AGE VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY. RESTRICTING ENTRY INTO TOBACCO STORES TO INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. TWENTY ONE AND STRICTER ADVERTISING PROMOTION OF PACKAGING RULES ARE ALL AREAS OF AGREEMENT. BUT THERE ARE ALSO AREAS WERE AGREEMENT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO COME BY. PARTICULARLY HOW TO HANDLE FLAVORS. AND HOW TO APPROPRIATELY DISCOURAGE YOU FROM POSSESSING THESE PRODUCTS. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE REPRESENTS THE CULMINATION OF THESE MEMBER CONVERSATIONS. THE BILL BEFORE TODAY IS THE STRONGEST AND MOST COMPREHENSIVE PROPOSAL ANY STATE HAS PUT FORWARD. TO ADDRESS THIS EPIDEMIC. THE BILL PROPOSES TO RESTRICT THE SALE OF FLAVORED E. CIGARETTES THE TWENTY ONE END ONLINE THROUGH WEBSITE USING AGE VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY. THE PROVISION HAS A TWENTY TWENTY TO SUNSET DATE. TO GIVE THIS COMMITTEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVISIT THIS PROBLEM MEASURE THE RESULTS AND SEE IF WE AS A BODY NEED TO IMPLEMENT EVEN MORE STRINGENT POLICIES TO FURTHER ADDRESS THE PROBLEM. IN ADDITION THIS PROVISION EXCLUDES TOBACCO. MEANT AND MENTHOL FLAVORS CONSISTENT WITH THE FDA'S PENDING REGULATIONS. THE FDA STATES THAT RECENT EVIDENCE INDICATES THAT MEANT AND MENTHOL FLAVORS ARE PREFERRED MORE BY ADULTS AND MINORS. WE WON'T IGNORE DATA REGARDING THE POPULARITY OF MINT MENTAL FLAVORS AMONG KIDS SHOULD CONCERNS RISE. THIS APPROACH REFLECTS A CAREFUL BALANCING OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS. THOSE ARE THE FDA'S OWN WORDS. THE FDA'S POSITION WAS PARTIALLY INFORMED BY RESEARCH PUBLISHED THIS YEAR FROM THE DARKNESS. GEISEL SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT WHICH FOUND THAT THE REGULATION OF SWEET E. CIGARETTE CIGARETTES. FLAVORS LIKE FRUIT AND CANDY MAY HELP REDUCE THE USE OF THE CIGARETTES AMONG YOUNG PERSONS WITHOUT SUBSTANTIALLY BURDENING ADULT YOU CIGARETTE USERS. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS APPROACH AGAIN THE TWENTY TWENTY TO SUNSET DATE WILL ALLOW THIS COMMITTEE TO REVISIT THE ISSUE OF FLAVORS INFORMED BY FINDINGS AND ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE FDA. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE ALSO CREATES ACCOUNTABILITY FOR KIDS COTTON POSSESSION UNLIKE ALCOHOL THERE ARE NO PENALTIES AND CURRENT LAW FOR YOU TO POSSESSION OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS INCLUDING IS CIGARETTES. THE BILL PROPOSES DRUG EDUCATION COMMITTEE SERVICE HOURS LOSS OF DRIVING PRIVILEGES FOR POSSESSION BY INDIVIDUALS LESS THAN EIGHTEEN YEARS OF AGE. IF THE PERSON IS EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE THE BILL IMPOSES A FINE OF NOT MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THE BILL ALSO PROHIBITS ADVERTISING PACKAGING THAT IS ATTRACTIVE TO KIDS INCLUDING BANNING THE USE OF CARTOON MASCOTS AND PACKAGING RESEMBLING CANDY. AND RAMPS UP PENALTIES ON RETAILERS AND STRAW PURCHASERS TO PROVIDE THESE PRODUCTS TO KIDS. THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CONDUCTS STING OPERATIONS AT RETAIL SITES. REPRESENTING NO LESS THAN 20% THE TOTAL NUMBER OF LICENSED TOBACCO RETAILERS. AND FINALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT EDUCATION TO SUBMIT A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE ON THE USE OF ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES IN CALIFORNIA AMONG MINORS. THE IMPACT OF FLAVOR DO CIGARETTE PRODUCTS ON THE IN THE INTEREST OF MINE IS THE PERCEPTION AND THE REASONS FOR THE ATTRACTION OF SPECIFIC FLAVORS. AND THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF THE CIGARETTES. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE REPRESENTS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO CLOSE YOUTH ACCESS. INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THOSE THAT VIOLATE THE LAW RESTRICTED EXPOSURE TO THESE PRODUCTS AND PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONTINUED OVERSIGHT AND EDUCATION ON THE ISSUE. THE BILL REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS MEMBERS. A NUMBER OF ORGANIZATIONS OF WRITTEN IN TO EXPRESSED CONCERNS OVER VARIOUS PROVISIONS OF THE BILL PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF RESTORING. PENALTIES FOR YOUTH IN POSSESSION. MEMBERS OF ALSO EXPRESSED CONCERNS ABOUT THE YOUTH PENALTIES I BELIEVE IN THE VALUE OF ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I'D SOUGHT TO RESTORE. MODEST AND REASONABLE PENALTIES CONSISTENT -- AND ALSO CONSISTING OF EDUCATION COMMITTEE SERVICE FOR YOUTH IN POSSESSION. I DO NOT SHARE THE BELIEF THAT KIDS ARE VICTIMIZED WHEN THEYARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR BREAKING THE LAW. HOWEVER THIS BILL IS A PRODUCT OF COMPROMISE. AND CONSENSUS SO AFTER CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL AUTHORS TO THIS BILL -- AS WELL AS COLLEAGUES OF THIS COMMITTEE AND OF OUR BODY. I HAVE AGREED TO ACCEPT THE MEMBERS TODAY. THAT REMOVE THE PENALTIES FOR YOUTH IN POSSESSION INCLUDING THE PROVISIONS RELATED TO COMMUTERSERVICE COUNSELING IN THE LOSS OF DRIVING PRIVILEGES. STRENGTH INTHE ADVERTISEMENT PROVISIONS TO BE CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING ADVERTISING PROHIBITIONS FOR COMBUSTIBLE TOBACCO BY PROHIBITING ADVERTISING AND SPONSORSHIP OF EVENTS WITH INTENDED AUDIENCE ABUSE INCLUDING SPORTING EVENTS AND CONCERTS. FINALLY PROHIBITING TOBACCO COMPANIES FROM USING TERMS OF COMMON. FOODS THAT APPEAL TO KIDS INCLUDING TERMS LIKE MILKSHAKE AND CUPCAKE. THEIR NUMBER OTHERS WISHING TO SPEAK SO I WILL CONCLUDE BY SAYING I THINK IS A MISTAKE FOR THOSE THAT DID NOT GET EVERYTHING THEY WANTED. IN THIS BILL TO WRITE IT OFF IDEOLOGICAL PURITY SHOULD NOT STAND IN THE WAY OF COMPROMISE IN PROGRESS THIS BILL PUTS CALIFORNIA AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF THE FIGHT AGAINST YOUTH THEY WITH ME TODAY MEMBERS -- WE HAVE A NEW ADDITION -- WITH THESE AMENDMENTS A COLLEAGUE WHO ENCOURAGED US TO TAKE THESE AMENDMENTS -- CITY COM LONGER DOVE AND MY COLLEAGUE JORDAN CUNNINGHAM WHO'S BEEN A JOINT AUTHORS -- SINCE YOUR DOCTOR THIS BILL I WILL TURN IT OVER TO OUR SON NUMBER CALMER DOT FOR HER COMMENTS. THANK YOU CHAIR GRAY COLLEAGUES. LAST WEEK. RIGHT AFTER THE FOURTH OF JULY MANY OF YOU MET MY STEP SON AUSTIN JUNIOR. WHEN HE SHADOWED ME IN THE CAPITAL IN JOINED ME DURING FLOOR SESSION? HE WILL BE ENTERING SEVENTH GRADE NEXT MONTH AND HIGH SCHOOL IS JUST OVER THE HORIZON. AND ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IF TRENDS CONTINUE ONE IN EIGHT OF HIS FUTURE CLASSMATES WILL USE A TOBACCO PRODUCT MOST LIKELY AND ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICE. US DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES DATA PUT THAT NUMBER AT ONE IN FIVE OF HIS FUTURE HIGH SCHOOL CLASSMATES. AS A PARENT. THOSE STATISTICS ARE FRIGHTENING. BUT TODAY. TODAY WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PASS A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO REVERSING RECENT TOBACCO TRENDS AND ENSURING THAT THESE ADDICTIVE PRODUCTS DO NOT END UP IN THE HANDS OF OUR CALIFORNIA USE. WITH THE AMENDMENTS PROPOSED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER GREAT TODAY CALIFORNIA STANDS TO SET ONE OF THE TOUGHEST ANTI VAPING LAWS IN THE COUNTRY. WHILE SANCTIONING THOSE WHO SELL TO MINORS IS CRITICAL TO ENFORCE EXISTING LAW OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE IS CURBING DESIRE FOR THESE PRODUCTS. YOUNG BRAINS ARE IMPRESSIONABLE. WE KNOW THAT YOUTH ARE VULNERABLE TO SOCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL INFLUENCES TO USE TOBACCO INCLUDING ADVERTISEMENTS MESSAGING AND IMAGES WHICH WITH WHICH MAKE TOBACCO USE APPEALING. WE KNOW THIS FROM WHEN WE WERE ALL MUCH YOUNGER JUST A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO FOR SOME. AND WE'RE TOLD OF THE HARM AND FALSE ADVERTISING OF TRADITIONAL TOBACCO. PROHIBITING E. CIGARETTE COMPANIES FROM IMITATING CANDY PACKAGING USING CARTON CONTAINERS AND PACKAGING INCLUDING CONFECTIONERY NAMES LIKE COTTON CANDY AND COOKIES AND CREAM. AN ADVERTISING IN AREAS IN WHICH YOUTH FREQUENT ARE IMPORTANT COMPONENTS IN PREVENTION EFFORTS. THESE MARKETING PROHIBITIONS COUPLED WITH INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES SANCTIONS FOR SALES TO MINORS LIMITED POINT OF SALE AND MANDATED AGE VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY WILL ADVANCE CALIFORNIA'S EFFORT TO CURB YOUTH TOBACCO USE. THE MEASURE BEFORE YOU WILL BUILD OFF OF EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH WHICH CALL FOR MULTI COMPONENT PROGRAMS WITH OUT IMPOSING STRICT PENALTIES PENALTIES FOR POSSESSION. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO ADD A FEW THINGS FROM A PERSPECTIVE THAT OF A PARENT. AND ON THIS ISSUE IN A PERSPECTIVE FROM THIS PURPOSE PERSPECTIVE OF FORMER. PROSECUTOR WHAT I SAW WITH RESPECT TO ENFORCEMENT OF LAW -- IN MY TIME DOING DOING NOT I I FIRST LEARNED WHAT VAPING WAS FROM MY MIDDLE AGE --DAUGHTERS. BUT A YEAR AGO I I HONESTLY DE HAD NO IDEA WHAT THAT TERM MEANT. AND THEN I FIGURED OUT THAT'S THE CIGARETTES OKAY -- AGAIN THESE ARE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS MY DAUGHTER'S THE TIME OR AN EIGHT AND SIX GREAT. I STARTED LOOKING INTO THE TO THE DE DATA -- THE FDA IS STUDY THIS FROM 200-011-2000 FIFTEEN THERE WAS A 9100% 9100% INCREASE IN -- USE OF VAPING PRODUCTS BY TEENAGERS. FROM THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN TO TWENTY EIGHTEEN THE FDA FOUNDER AN ADDITIONAL 78% INCREASE AMONG HIGH SCORES. AND THE 48% INCREASE AMONG MIDDLE SCHOOLERS. THE FDA PROJECTS THAT THERE ARE FOUR MILLION KIDS TODAY USING E. CIGARETTES I ASKED MY AT THE TIME MIDDLE AGED SCHOOL DAUGHTERS WHETHER THEY KNEW ANYBODY. AFTER START LOOKING AT THE STATS WHICH WERE MIND BOGGLING WITH THE NEW ANYBODY IN THEIR SCHOOL AND THIS IS A MIDDLE CLASS MIDDLE OF AMERICA TYPE SCHOOL. WHETHER THEY KNEW ANYBODY AT THE MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT USE VAPE APING PRODUCTS OR E. CIGARETTES AND THEY ACTUALLY LAUGHED. THINGS LIKE THAT THIS IS THE RESPONSE THAT EVERYBODY DOES THAT. TO WHICH I SAID. THE CUNNINGHAMS BETTER NOT BE DOING. I HOPE YOU DON'T MEAN EVERYBODY WE GOT SOME THINGS TO TALK ABOUT MOM. BUT IT IS A TRULY AN EPIDEMIC AND IT IS GROWING FASTER THAN ALMOST ANY THINGS GROWING. IN TERMS OF NUMBERS IN OUR COUNTRY. WE HAVE A CHANCE TODAY TO PASS WHAT IS OBJECTIVELY. SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT ITS COMPONENTS SAY WHAT YOU WILL ABOUT. THE WORK PRODUCT AS IT STANDS NOW BUT THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL WILL CALIFORNIA IF ENACTED INTO LAW WILL BE. THE TOUGHEST ON TEENAGE VAPING IN THE COUNTRY. THIS BILL IS A WORK PRODUCT OF THE CHAIR MR GRAY -- THE SENATORS ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE TOOK A LOT OF THE PROVISIONS FROM THE FDA'S REGULATIONS THAT THEY HAVE NOT ENACTED YET BUT THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS. AND ON THE ENFORCEMENT PIECE. I CAN TELL YEAH AS AS A FORMER PROSECUTOR. ALL OF THESE AGENCIES ARE UNDER RESOURCE THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH HAS JURISDICTION OVER THIS THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT MANY SWORN PEACE OFFICERS. THEY STUDIED AND SURVEYED HIGH SCHOOLS WHERE ASK THEM WHERE YOU'RE GETTING YOUR VAPING PRODUCTS. 74% OF HIGH SCHOOL -- SURVEYED SAID THEY GET HIM AT CONVENIENCE STORES. THAT TELLS ME ONE THING. WE ARE NOT ENFORCING THE LAW. SOMEBODY'S WALKING IN AND THEY'RE NOT BEING CARTED OR THEIR PASSING OFTEN FAKE ID JUST LIKE THE OLD DAYS. AND THEY'RE WALKING OUT WITH THE PRODUCT IT'S NOT LEGAL FOR THEM TO PROCESS WHICH IS ADDICTING. SO WE'VE GOT IT WE'VE GOT A NARROW THE ENFORCEMENT SO WE CAN DEPLOY RESOURCES BETTER IN THIS BILL DOES THAT. THIS BILL ALSO CONTAINS PROHIBITIONS ON MARKETING TO KIDS WHICH THE CHAIR. ADDRESSED AND THAT'S AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT. OF THE DRESSING THIS PROBLEM. IN A WHOLESALE FASHION. HOW THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION ROAD IN YOUTH PURCHASE POSSESSION USED USE LAWS DO NOT PROTECT CHILDREN FROM THE MISLEADING MESSAGING ADVERTISING BY THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY? WHOLEHEARTEDLY AGREE THAT'S WHY WE'RE DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT IN THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE THING THAT THIS LEGISLATIVE BODIES TRY TO DO ON THIS ISSUE AND I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU. THE MOST COMPREHENSIVE THING THAT ANY LEGISLATIVE BODY HAS TRIED TO DO. MORE THAN CONGRESS IS DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER STATE LEGISLATURES DONE. WE HAVE WORK TO DO. TO REFINE THE PROVISIONS IN THIS BILL. BUT LET'S NOT MAKE THE PERFECT THE ENEMY THE A GOOD OF THE GOOD WE'VE GOT A CHANCE. TO MAKE A REAL DENT IN THIS EPIDEMIC AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR DR. GO AHEAD MR GRAY. THIS CHAIR THANK YOU WERE. I'D LIKE TO TAKE A MOMENT TO MAKE A SPECIAL INTRODUCTION. FOR ONE OF OUR SUPPORTERS HERE TODAY. THIS IS ONE OF THE BRIGHTEST YOUNG PEOPLE THAT I'VE MET IN RECENT MEMORY. RON AT THE KNOCK IS GOING INTO HER SOPHOMORE YEAR MODESTO HIGH SCHOOL MY DISTRICT. SHE WROTE AN OP ED LAST MONTH WHICH WAS PUBLISHED IN MODESTO BEE THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION DESCRIBING HER EXPERIENCE AS A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT. SEEING THE UPSURGE IN VAPING AMONG HER CLASSMATES. HER OP ED WAS WELL RESEARCHED. INCREDIBLY ELOQUENT AND PRAGMATIC. I ADVISED HER TODAY -- HERE. TODAY TO GIVE HER FIRST HAND ACCOUNT OF THIS ISSUE AND INFORM THE COMMITTEE OF THE REAL WORLD PROBLEM WE'RE FACING FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF YOUNG PERSON -- DEALING WITH THIS EVERY DAY SO WITH THAT. RUN A PLEASE -- PRESENT YOUR TESTIMONY. GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE MY NAME IS RON ABANDONED BECAUSE I'M A CONSTITUENT OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER ADAM GRAY. AND A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MODESTO HIGH SCHOOL I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE OUR LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES DEMAND REFORM. AS A TEENAGER IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT MYSELF I HAVE THE UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE OF WITNESSING FIRSTHAND ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE EPIDEMIC IN TODAY'S YOUTH. I PERSONALLY KNOW TEENAGERS WHO HAVE GONE TO STORES AND ASKED TO BUY YOU CIGARETTES. AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT THE CASHIER SAID TO THEM. THEY SAID HOW WILL YOU BE PAYING TODAY. SCENARIOS LIKE THESE WHICH HAPPENED FAR TOO OFTEN VIVIDLY HIGHLIGHT THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAVE WITH EASE CIGARETTE REGULATION. TO BE ON WITH NO ID WAS ASKED WHY WOULD DAY THE CLERK KNOWS OF THE E. CIGARETTE MARKET IS SATURATED WITH MINORS. NO ONE IS THERE TO CATCH THEM IN THE FINE FOR DOING SO IS MINUSCULE COMPARED TO THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS THAT THEY COULD BE MAKING. SO THEY SELF IN FACT A RECENT SURVEY SHOWED THAT 74% OF TEENS USERS. SIMPLY PURCHASED THIRD TOOL AT A RETAIL LOCATION. NO QUESTIONS ASKED. AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THIS BILL TACKLES HEAD ON BECAUSE IT MANDATES MORE DECOYS STING OPERATIONS IN INCREASES THE PENALTY FOR STORES THAT DO SELL TO MINORS. SO THEY WILL GET CAUGHT AND LEARN THEIR LESSON THE FIRST TIME. WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO SEND A STRONG SIGNAL TO THE STORES SO THAT CHILDREN DON'T GET THEIR HANDS ON THESE PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST PLACE. I ALSO SUPPORT THE LIMITATION OF THE SALE OF FLAVOR PRODUCTS AND ALL STORES ACCEPT TOBACCO SHOPS. THIS WILL TAKE AWAY SOME OF THE INCENTIVE FOR TEENAGERS TO SMOKE AS IT'S NO SECRET THAT THESE FLAVORS DIRECTLY FEEL TO CHILDREN. ALTHOUGH SOME MAY ACTIVELY PUSH FOR A COMPLETE BAN OF ALL FLEA RUDY CIGARETTE PRODUCTS I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS APPROACH WOULD BE EFFECTIVE IN SOLVING THE PROBLEM. TO PUT IT SIMPLY THE FLAVORS ARE A BIG PART OF THE REASON WHY EASE CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION RATES AMONG TEENS ARE HIGH. HOWEVER THAT IS NOT WHAT KEEPS SCENES COMING. I'LL BE THE FIRST TO SAY THAT THE MAIN REASON WHY TEENS VAPOR JEWEL IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE THIS IDEA IN THEIR HEAD. BUT IT'S COOL. THEY SEE IT ALL OVER SOCIAL MEDIA ALL OF THEIR FRIENDS HAVE. ONE AND THE PEER PRESSURE JUST BECOMES UNBEARABLE. SO THEY BY ONE THEMSELVES AND POST ABOUT ON SOCIAL MEDIA. TO SOMEONE ELSE USE THEIR STORY BECOMES INFLUENCED BY SOMEONE IN THE CYCLE JUST CONTINUES AND CONTINUES. I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN FIRSTHAND TO PEOPLE I KNOW. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE ME JUST LOOK ONLINE. AND ACCORDING TO A RECENT STUDY PURCHASING DECISIONS ARE INFLUENCED BY THEIR FRIENDS SOCIAL MEDIA POSTS -- ALSO FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO BUY A PRODUCT BECAUSE THEY WERE REFERRED TO IT BY A FRIEND. PUT THOSE TWO TOGETHER AND YOU HAVE AN EPIDEMIC ON YOUR HANDS. SO HOW DO WE STOP TEENS FROM USING E. CIGARETTES. WE MAKE THEM DIFFICULT TO PURCHASE THE SAME LOGIC APPLIES TO ALCOHOL YOU ALL BETTER THAN I KNOW HOW MANY FUNDS RINGS IN FLAVORS OF ALCOHOL THERE ARE. IN THE PAST MANY TEENS LEGALLY DRINK ALCOHOL AND WE EVEN TRIED TO BAN ALL ALCOHOL IN AN ATTEMPT TO PROTECT PEOPLE'S HEALTH. AND AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT DIDN'T WORK OUT VERY WELL. BUT NOW RATES ARE FINALLY DECLINING. SO WHAT DID WE DO. WE MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO PURCHASE. AND IT LOST ITS POPULARITY. THOSE TWO THINGS ARE NOT MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE BUT RATHER DIRECTLY CORRELATED. SAME WITH CIGARETTES THEY USED TO BE WILDLY POPULAR AMONG TEENS BUT NOW RATES ARE DECLINING. SO WHAT DID WE DO WE MADE THEM DIFFICULT TO ACCESS IN EDUCATED TEENS ABOUT. THE DETRIMENTS THAT TOBACCO FACE THAT TOBACCO. HAS TO THEIR HOUSE. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IT GIVES A REASON FOR BOTH RETAILERS TO STOP SELLING TO MINORS AND FOR MINORS TO STOP SMOKING E. CIGARETTES. SEE EVEN IF WE BANNED ALL FLAVORS WHAT ABOUT THE MILLIONS OF TEAMS THAT ARE ALREADY ADDICTED. BILL JUST SWITCH THE FLAVORLESS PRODUCTS CONSIDERING HOW MUCH ADDICTIVE NICOTINE IS IN THESE EASE CIGARETTES THEY WILL DO ANYTHING FOR THEIR FIX. AND THEIR FRIENDS WILL STILL FEEL THE SAME PEER PRESSURE AS THEY DID BEFORE. BUT IF WE ATTACK THIS PROBLEM FROM ITS SOURCE AND MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR TEENS TO ACCESS. THIS TOO WILL LOSE ITS POPULARITY. AND I KNOW THAT THESE BILLS MAY NOT BE PERFECT FOR EVERYONE. BUT IT MAKES PROGRESS IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROTECT MILLIONS OF TEENS. AND THAT'S INVALUABLE CONSIDERING THAT AS EVERYDAY PASSES. MORE MORE TEENS ARE BECOMING ADDICTED TO THESE PRODUCTS MORE AND MORE MY GENERATION BECOMES CONSUMED BY ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES. PERSONALLY I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO JUST SIT BY AND WATCH AS MY PEERS AND FRIENDS BECOME ADDICTED. TO WE'VE SEEN HE SAME THING HAPPENED WITH TEENS AND CIGARETTES IN THE PAST AND MILLIONS LOS OUR LIVES BECAUSE OF IT. WE CAN'T JUST SIT AROUND AND ARGUE UNTIL WE CREATE THE PERFECT BILL BECAUSE FRANKLY IT'LL NEVER HAPPEN. BUT WE CAN START BY MAKING PROGRESS RIGHT NOW. SO IN CONCLUSION I FIRMLY BELIEVE THAT THESE BILLS WOULD EFFECTIVELY COMBAT THE ON GOING AT THAT I MAKE UP UNDER AGE ELECTRONIC CIGARETTE CONSUMPTION. THANK YOU. SPOKEN WORK QUITE WELL THANK. NEXT -- PRESENTER. GOOD AFTERNOON MORNING CAR ALL THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA MEDICAL SUCH AS A ASSOCIATION AS LONG SUPPORTED REDUCING YOUTH ACCESS AND EXPOSURE TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS AS NICOTINE IS NOT ONLY HIGHLY ADDICTIVE A HARM FOR THE ADOLESCENT BRAIN DEVELOPMENT. IMPACTING INTENTION LEARNING AND MEMORY. WELL CONSIDERABLE CONSIDERABLE PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN REDUCING SMOKING OF COMBUSTIBLE SO CIGARETTES AMONG YOUTH THE TOBACCO PRODUCT LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED. AND THE INCREASING YOUR CONCEPTION CONSUMPTION OF MUSIC RATS AS DISTURBING. FROM TWENTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN YOUTH CONSUMPTION OF ELECTRIC CIGARETTES INCREASED 278% AMONG HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND 48% AMONG MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. IT'S ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN THREE POINT SIX MILLION U. S. YOUTH CURRENTLY DOOZY CIGARETTES. THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES THESE INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE AN INCREASED RISK OF DEVELOPING A TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE INCLUDING CANCER LUNG DISEASE HEART DISEASE AND STROKE. AS THE MARKET FREE CIGARETTES AND THE EVIDENCE FOR THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CIGARETTE YEARS HAS GROWN SO HAS THE POSITIONS DESIRE TO ENSURE REGULATION OF THEM. CALIFORNIA MUST TAKE ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC AND REDUCE USE OF THESE PRODUCTS IF YOUTH USE OF THESE PRODUCTS. AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE ALLOWS US TO HAVE THIS IMPORTANT DISCUSSION ON HOW TO REDUCE CONSUMPTION OF THESE TOBACCO PRODUCTS. SEVERAL OF THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL HELP MOVE THE NEEDLE ON REDUCING CONSUMPTION BY INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ON RETAILERS INCREASING PENALTIES TO SALES OF SALES TO MINORS. AND SETTING LIMITATIONS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF FLAVORED GREAT PRODUCTS. CMA REQUESTED THAT THE AUTHOR CONSIDER AMENDMENTS TO STRENGTHEN PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THAT RESTRICT MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS AVE PRODUCTS IN A WAY THAT ATTRACTS KIDS WE APPRECIATE THAT HE'S DONE THAT TODAY. WE'VE ALSO REQUESTED THAT AMENDMENT BE TAKEN TO REMOVE PENALTIES AGAINST YOUTH POSSESSION -- FOR VAPING PRODUCTS. WE ALSO APPRECIATE THOSE AMENDMENTS TAKEN TODAY. AS WE CONTINUE THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT REDUCING YOUTH CONCEPTION OF THESE HARMFUL PRODUCTS YOU MAY WOULD ASK THAT MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MOVE THE BILL FORD. THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISCUSSION THAT COULD NOT STOP HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT TESTIMONY IF I COULD GO. TO THE AUDIENCE FOR A PERSON -- PEOPLE WISHING TO ADDRESS THE BODY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. ANYBODY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL KIND OF A TWEENER CAN I MAKE SOME COMMENTS IN BETWEEN WELL IF THERE'S NOBODY WISHING TO COME TO THE FRONT FOR SUPPORT. THEN I'LL GO TO TWEET -- WINTERS IN OPPOSITION. IF I COULD GET. IF I COULD GET EVERYBODY AT THE MICROPHONE. FOR FOR FOR THE OPPOSITION. IN BREAKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU -- SO I'M A STUDENT AT RIO AMERICANO HIGH SCHOOL AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. IS OPPOSITION NEXT. CAN I CAN ACTUALLY GET BETWEEN WELL I WAS DOING. I STARTED BACK HERE LET'S GET WITH YOU MY NAME IS LARGELY TRAVIS I'M FROM LIVING IN MERCED RIGHT NOW AND I PROVIDE A LOT OF PROGRAM DESIGN ANY VALUATION. TO ABOUT TWENTY COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA IS SPECIALLY IN TOBACCO CONTROL PROGRAMMING -- I'M HERE TO EXPRESS THAT I HAVE I AM IN OPPOSITION TO AB. SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE I AGREE WITH -- A LOT OF THE DOCTOR A LOT OF THE POINTS THAT DOCTOR GARDNER WILL BE MAKING -- AND GIVEN WOULD YOU LIKE TO LOG. SERGEANTS IF YOU DON'T MIND IF YOU COULD JUST SIR. IF YOU STAND IT A WHOLE LOT SIR SIR HOLD ON IF YOU COULD STAND IN LINE. AND TAKE YOUR TIME. I UNDERSTAND THAT AND YOU DECIDED TO STEP OUT OF LINE AND HAD AN ARGUMENT. IF OR WHEN THEY SET OFF. IF IF YOU DON'T MIND OKAY WELL I CAN'T IF YOU CAN'T STAND TAKE YOUR PLACE IN LINE. I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DECIDED TO MAKE ITS DECISION TO STEP OUT OF LINE THE CHOICE. SIR WHO WERE SORRY SIR THE CHOICES ARE RIGHT NOW. BACK IN LINE. AN TAKE YOUR TURN. OR THE REST OF THE SERGEANTS LISTS WERE YOU OUT -- PLEASE THAT WOMAN HAS NOT FINISHED ALLOW HER TO FINISH THIRD. OKAY -- SO I'M GONNA CONTINUE FROM WHERE I LEFT OFF. SO I WANTED TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE EXCLUSION A MENTALLY IT AND MEN'S PRODUCTS. SIX LEARNING MENTAL MEANT MENTAL AND MEN'S RELATED FLAVORS WEAKENS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THIS POLICY. ANY FLAVOR RESTRICTION POLISH SEE SHOULD INCLUDE ALL FLAVORS FOR ALL TOBACCO PRODUCTS -- MENTAL PRO TOBACCO PRODUCTS ARE CONSIDERED THE TOBACCO INDUSTRY STARTER PACKED -- DUE TO THE NUMBING AFFECTS. IT IS EASIER TO MASK A LOT OF THE HARSHNESS UP TOBACCO WITH OF THIS. MENTAL'S ALSO HAS GREATER ADDICTION PROPERTIES. SO PEOPLE WHOSE CHOOSE TO SMOKE MENTAL PRODUCTS INCLUDING E. CIGARETTES ARE LESS LIKELY TO QUIT SMOKING COMPARE -- TO INDIVIDUALS WHO SMOKE OTHER FLAVORS. ALTHOUGH CIGARETTE USE IS DECLINING IN THE U. S. THE USE OF MENTAL CIGARETTES HAS INCREASED IN RECENT YEARS ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR YOUNGER USERS AND USE. WELL ONLY 25% OF CIGARETTES SOLD IN THE US ARE LABELED AS A MENTAL 90% OF FLAVORED PRODUCTS HAVE SOME KIND OF MENTAL IN THEM. MAKING IT MORE ADDICTING AND LESS HARSH TO SMOKE. MENTAL MAKES UP ABOUT 35% OF US CIGARETTES SALES IN THE UNITED STATES AS WELL. OTHER FLAVOR EXCLUDE EXCLUDED UNDER THEM BILL IS MEANT THIS IS THE NUMBER ONE E. CIGARETTE FLAVOR USE BY YOUTH AND MOST DEFINITELY SHOULD NOT BE INCLUDED. FOR SHOULD NOT BE EXCLUDED I'M SORRY. AS STATED IT IS IMPERATIVE TO INCLUDE ALL FLAVORS TO BE PART OF THE FLAVOR RESTRICTION POLICY I URGE YOU TO VOTE NO AND THE AB SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE THANK YOU. SORRY FOR THE INTERRUPTION -- MY NAME IS DOCTOR PHILIP GARDNER I AM THE CO CHAIR OF THE AFRICAN AMERICAN TOBACCO CONTROL LEADERSHIP COUNCIL. I AM ALSO WORKED AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TOBACCO RELATED DISEASE RESEARCH PROGRAM FOR THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. THANK CONTRARY TO WHAT -- ASSEMBLYMAN ADAMS -- HAS PUT FORWARD OF THE THE FDA MADE A MISTAKE IN TWO THOUSAND NINE WHEN IT EXCLUDED MEN FALL FROM THE PRODUCTS THAT WERE RESTRICTED. IT LEFT IT IN AND FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS THERE'S BEEN AN EPIDEMIC OF MENTHOL USE AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS THAT IS LED TO THE DISPROPORTIONATE DYING OF THESE PRODUCTS. THERE IS NO REASON TO LEAVE MENTHOL AND MET OUT OF IT. IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF A PERFECT BILL IT'S NOT A QUESTION OF ITS BAN IT'S A QUESTION OF NOT MAKING FLAVORS AVAILABLE AT ALL. WHY DID THEY PUT FLAVORS IN THESE PRODUCTS IN THE FIRST PLACE? THAT ALLOWS THE POISON TO GO DOWN EASIER. THE FDA HAS NO DATA ON HOW MENTAL HAS HELPED ANYBODY SWITCHED -- TO TO TO GET OFF IN FACT. THE DATA SHOWS THAT CIGARETTE SMOKING HAS GONE DOWN OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT WHAT IS GONNA. IS BEEN THE YOUTH THE MALES USE MENTHOL CIGARETTES. AND THIS IS NOT ONLY TRUE OF AFRICAN AMERICAN. WOMEN DISPROPORTIONATELY USE MENTHOL CIGARETTES FOLKS FROM THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY DISPROPORTIONATELY IS MALE MENTAL CIGARETTES.

AND AS FAR AS GETTING. ACCESS ONLINE I AGREE THANK YOU FOR YOUR DOING THAT BUT IT ADDS THIS BILL I OPPOSE THANK. MY NAME IS MILTON WHEN AND I OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I THINK WE HAVE SOMEONE AT THE TABLE. DID YOU WANT TO SPEAK. YOU WERE ONE OF THOSE IT DIDN'T GET RECOGNIZE I WANNA MAKE SURE. YOUR POSITION. YEAH I'M IN A POSITION. TO ADVISE YOUR CIRCLE YOU WITH SURE -- WITH THAT THEY'VE TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- CONNECT WIENER YES. IT DID WHEN YOU HAVE A STATEMENT YOU WANT. YEAH OKAY SO LET'S LET'S TAKE CARE OF YOUR STATEMENT. THANK YOU. SHOULD RUN IT THANK THANK YOU -- VICE CHAIRMAN -- GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN GRAY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME'S JAKE BUTCHER ON THE STATE AFFAIRS MANAGER FOR THE PAPER TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION -- OUR MEMBERS EMPLOYED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AROUND THE COUNTRY IN HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- LAST FISCAL YEAR AND THEY PLAN TO ST GENERATED OVER. A FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION AND STATE LOCAL TAXES FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- WE APPEAR TODAY AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE AS AMENDED -- AS DRAFTED ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE CONTAINS MANY PROVISIONS THAT ARE IN LINE WITH THE LEGISLATIVE POLICY AND GOALS AT THE BEACH IS A STRICTLY SUPPORTED. AND ADOPTED IN THEIR OWN -- MARKETING STANDARDS SUCH AS THE PROHIBITION MARKETING AND PACKAGING CURES TOWARDS CHILDREN. STIFFER PENALTIES AGAINST THOSE WHO SELL TO MINORS. INCLUDING STRAW PURCHASES. WHICH IS DATA SHOWS THE PRIMARY OFFENDERS OF UNDERAGE SALE SO NOT THE RETAIL LEVEL. BUT BUT FROM. OTHERS. ENHANCED ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING LAWS SO WE APPLAUD -- THE WELL INTENTIONED EFFORTS TO CURB YOUTH ACCESS TO PAPER PRODUCTS. HOWEVER THE RESTRICTION OF FLAVOR -- PAPER PRODUCTS AGE RESTRICTED STORES WILL SEVERELY LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY OF FLAVOR VAPOR PRODUCTS TO ADULTS WHO DESPERATELY TRYING TO QUIT. AND I THINK YOU HEARD FROM SOME OF THEM TODAY WHILE LEAVING ACCESS TO DEADLY COMBUSTIBLE CIGARETTES AND FLAVORED COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS ON CHANGE SO THEY ACCESS TO THOSE. WHO REMAIN UNCHANGED WHY WE LIMIT THE ACCESS? TO LESS HARMFUL TURNED OF IN PAPER PRODUCTS WITH REGARD TO LABELING AND MARKETING STANDARDS IN THE BILL. CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE ALREADY ADOPTED. MARKETING AND LABELING STANDARDS OF COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS RELATED TO CANNABIS TO POP PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR I WHICH SIMILAR TO THE BILL AS PROPOSED BY CHAIRMAN GRAY. I PROHIBITS THE USE OF CARTOONS IMITATIONS OF CANDY PACKAGING AND LABELING. AND THE USE OF THE TERM CANDY AMONG OTHER ITEMS. THE VAPOR TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THAT CLEAR CONCISE AND ENFORCEABLE MARKING LABELING STANDARDS FOR APPROPRIATE. HOWEVER THIS BILL GOES FAR BEYOND. THE LABELING AND MARKETING RESTRICTIONS IN PROPOSITION. SIXTY FOUR AND CREATES A VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS MARKETING AND LABELING SCHEME. BY USING THE TERM. OF ART REASONABLE BELIEF. THAT THE PRODUCT COULD BE APPEALING TO PERSONS UNDER TWENTY ONE OF EIGHT YEARS OF AGE AGAIN THE STANDARD. IT'S SIMPLY NOT TO FIND ANYWHERE I IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL AND LEAVES A LOT OF AN AMBIGUITY. WOULD LIKE TO WORK -- WITH THE SPONSOR TO ADDRESS THAT. IN ADDITION THE BILL PROHIBITS. ADVERTISING BRAND ELEMENTS TO LIFESTYLE ADVERTISING -- WHICH IS DEFINED UNDER THE BILL AS A BOOKING A POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE EMOTION ABOUT IT IN THAT WAY OF LIFE. INCLUDING ONE THAT INCLUDES CLAMOR RECREATION EXCITEMENT VITALITY RISK OF DARING -- PUT SIMPLY -- THIS IS TANTAMOUNT TO AN ADVERTISING BAN. GIVEN THE FACT ALL ADVERTISEMENT ELICITS AN EMOTION. IN ADDITION -- THE BILL PROHIBITS THE USE OF TESTIMONIALS WHICH IMPACTS YOU BOIL THE BILL ANY OF REAL PEOPLE REAL CONSUMERS. TO TELL THEIR STORY SO THAT'S ANOTHER. CHALLENGE WITH THE BILL AS DRAFTED -- LASTLY THE BILL PROPOSES PENALTIES ON BUSINESSES WITHOUT JUSTIFICATION. SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THOSE OF SOMEWHERE INDUSTRIES SUCH AS ALCOHOL THIS IS FOR SALES -- TO MINORS -- SPECIFICALLY A SIXTY DAY LICENSE SUSPENSION ON THE FIRST OFFENSE. IS UNPRECEDENTED AND WHICH SHOT SMALL VAPOUR BUSINESSES. LIKE THOSE WHO HEARD FROM TODAY. SO FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS WE OPPOSE ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN THIRTY NINE STRAPPED AND HOW WE APPRECIATE -- CHAIRMAN GRACE COMMENTS TODAY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORKING WITH THE CHAIR AND CO AUTHORS. TO FIND COMMON GROUND AND MORE TARGETED APPROACHES TO LIMITING YOUTH ACCESS TO PAPER PRODUCTS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU CHAIRMAN. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A TWEENER IN THE AUDIENCE. YES THANK YOU -- JOHN WINGER ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FUELS INCONVENIENCE ALLIANCE WE REPRESENT OVER HALF OF THE TWELVE THOUSAND GAS STATIONS AND CONVENIENCE STORES. IN THE STATE -- WE'RE KIND OF IN A TWEENER POSITION WE THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD THINGS IN THIS BILL ESPECIALLY AROUND ENFORCEMENT AND PENALTIES WHICH WE KNOW IS A GOOD. WAY AT CURBING -- TEEN ACCESS AS WE KNOW 7580% OF MINERS THAT OBTAIN VAPES GET IT FROM SOMEBODY THAT'S TWENTY ONE OR OVER THREE STOP PURCHASING SO WE THINK THIS IS A REASONABLE APPROACH. TO CURBING THAT WE WOULD PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT ON THE COMMENTS THAT 70% OF OF TEENS ARE PURCHASING THESE PRODUCTS ILLEGALLY FROM OUR STORES ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE HAVE OVER 95% SUCCESS RATE. AT RESTRICTING MINORS TO AGE VERIFIED -- GREAT RESTRICTED PRODUCTS -- AND SO WE THINK THAT WE HAVE -- A LONGSTANDING HISTORY OF BEING AT THE FRONT LINES TO PREVENT MINORS FROM THESE -- PRODUCTS AND WE THINK THAT THE INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY -- VERIFICATION AS WELL AS THE STREET THREE STRIKES LIMIT ON OUR FOLKS IS GOING A LONG WAY AND AND NOT PREVENTING -- MORE YOUTH ACCESS AND SO WE DO HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THE TWENTY ONE AND OVER -- FLAVOR CIGARETTES CONSIDERING THAT ARE FLAVORED. VAPOR TECHNOLOGY MY PRODUCTS CONSIDERING THAT WE WE DO ARE EFFECTIVE AT AGE RESTRICTED -- AT VERIFICATION SO WE WOULD -- HAVE AN ISSUE WITH THAT BUT WE DO THINK THE MAJORITY OF THE BILLS IN GOOD SHAPE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW THAT WAS A TWEENER -- IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION THAT HASN'T ALREADY SPOKEN IF YOU FORTY SPOKEN WITH YOU'VE HAD YOUR TIME HAVE YOU SPOKEN SIR I DID. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SO. WITH THAT -- IF THERE'S NO OTHER OPPOSITION AND I KNOW A COUPLE OF SUPPORTERS GOT IN THERE ANY OPPOSITION LINE. IS THERE ANY OTHER SUPPORT I DON'T WANNA MAKE SURE I WANNA MAKE SURE ONCE HAD THEIR CHANCE. I'LL BRING IT BACK -- TO MEMBERS ARE THERE QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS MISTER BRO. THANK YOU -- I JUST WONDERED -- MISTER CHAIR DURING YOUR DELIBERATIONS IF THERE IS ANY CONSIDERATION OF THE MILITARY A LOT OF MEN AND WOMEN COME TO CALIFORNIA EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD WEAR THE UNIFORM IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ON ON THAT -- THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION ON THAT AND AS I RECALL. WE WORK WE STAYED CONSISTENT. WITH THE LAW CURRENTLY WHEN THE TWENTY ONE AND OVER PROVISION WAS PASSED BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AS PART OF THAT PACKAGE -- MILITARY PERSONNEL WITH A MILITARY ID CAN PURCHASE -- AND EIGHTEEN THAT WAS THE COMPROMISE REACHED IN THAT PACKAGE AND THIS -- PROPOSAL IS CONSISTENT -- WITH THAT THANK YOU MISTER FOR CAR FROM THAT. MR BERMAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO FIRST ALL THANK YOU. TO TO ALL THE AUTHORS OF THE BILL IN THAT AND IT REALIZE THAT. GROUP IS GROWING RAPIDLY -- WOULD BE HAPPY TO WELCOME ME ON AS A JOINT AUTHORS MR I I I I REALLY HOPE I CAN GET THERE ONE DAY -- BUT AND I APPRECIATE THE THE MEMBERS YOU TOOK THOSE TO NECESSARILY ACTUALLY JUST SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT I HAD -- WHICH WERE LARGELY AROUND THE EXCLUSION OF MEN AND MENTHOL. FLAVORS AND AND ALSO THAT THE AGE VERIFICATION FOR ONLINE PURCHASES WHICH I UNDERSTAND IS IS AN UP FRONT -- ALGORITM A SOLUTION AS OPPOSED TO A BACK AND HAVING THE SEAVER OF THE THE PACKAGE SIGN. UP FOR THE NO I I SOMETIMES BY. ALCOHOL AND WINE -- ON THE INTERNET AND IT'S A PAIN IN THE THEY DELIVER IT AND SO THEN THEY KEEP IT AT THE FED EX FACILITY AND HAVE. TO GO TO THE FEDEX FACILITY AND SIGN FOR IT AND THAT IS A PAIN BUT IT'S A GOOD PAIN -- AND I THINK IT'S IT'S I THINK IT'S A STEP THAT. WE SHOULD HAVE A IT'S A STEP THAT FURTHER RESTRICTS UNDER AGE PEOPLE FROM GETTING ACCESS IN THIS CASE ALCOHOL AGAIN AND MY GUESS ALCOHOL OR IN THIS CASE. TO TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND MAKING PRODUCTS -- AND SO -- WOULD BE CURIOUS TO KNOW WHY THE BILL HAS THE THE ALGORITHMIC SOLUTION AS SENT THE RECEIVER OF THE PACKAGE SIGNED FOR IT. AS A THANK YOU -- FOR THOSE QUESTIONS. THE FIRST THING -- RESPOND TO IS THE MENTAL MET AND AS YOU CAN TELL FROM THE TESTIMONY PROVIDE TODAY BOTH IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION THERE -- IS DISCREPANCIES -- IN THAT SPACE RIGHT YOU HAVE ACADEMIC STUDIES ARE QUOTED BY THE FDA THAT SUGGESTS THAT MEANT PAUL MEANT -- ARE NOT A USE. ISSUES THAT ARE NOT DRIVING IS CONSUMPTION YOU HAVE TO TEST PUBLIC TESTIMONY HERE TODAY -- FOR GENTLEMEN. WAS ASSOCIATE WITH BERKELEY IS WHEN I HEARD -- SAYING THAT THAT THAT IS IN FACT A DRIVER -- SO GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE COULDN'T FIND CONSENSUS -- EVEN ALL THE DATA OR RESEARCH ON THE SUBJECT WE DIDN'T INCLUDE BECAUSE THE PURPOSE OF THIS. BILL IS TO VERY SPECIFICALLY TARGET YOU FAX AND JIM. THIS ISN'T A BIT BILL ABOUT LARGER TOBACCO ISSUE THIS ISN'T A BILL ABOUT TRADITIONAL DAHLE PRODUCTS LIKE MENTAL THAT HAVE BEEN IN CIRCULATION FOR DECADES. RIGHT THIS IS A BILL -- TO ADDRESS THE INCREASE IN USE -- UTILIZATION OVER THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND SO THAT EXT YOU KNOW IT IS WHY WOULD NOT INCLUDED THOSE -- QUOTE UNQUOTE FLAVORS AND AT THIS JUNCTURE AND THAT IS A DEFINITION CONSISTENT WITH THE FDA WHERE THEY HAVE TRADITIONAL TOBACCO MEANT BY. MID AND MENTHOL IN ONE CATEGORY OTHER FLAVORS LIKE FRUIT CHILL AND CRAM AND OTHERS IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY -- THE SECOND QUESTION IS -- RELATES -- TO SIGNATURE VERIFICATION AS YOU KNOW THAT'S A BILL THAT HAS MADE ITS WAY THROUGH THIS -- INSTITUTION. BEFORE. AND IT'S A BILL AND A CONCEPT CURRENTLY CONTAINED IN A SENATE BILL -- ONE OF OUR COLLEAGUE SURGERY HILL WHO HAS A BILL ON THAT INTERFACE WITH THE THE ONLINE DELIVERY -- WE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW SIR HILL HAD THE OPTION TO PARTICIPATE AND WAS ABLE TO PRESCRIBE SUMMER STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS -- WHICH YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S GOOD ISSUE -- WE THOUGHT ABOUT INCLUDING IT IN THIS BILL BUT WE DECIDED -- TO INSTEAD LET IT MOVE FORWARD IN THE SENATOR HILL BILL WHICH IS ON TODAY'S AGENDA -- IT WILL BE PRESENTED FOR THE NOW TO TAKE THAT AND COUPLE IT WITH THE AGE VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY MANDATE THAT'S AND THIS LEGISLATION I THINK YOU'VE GOT A PRETTY ROBUST APPROACH TO ONLINE SELF. SO DISAPPOINTED THAT I APPRECIATE THAT SO TO MAKE SURE I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY IF BOTH BILLS WERE TO PASS YOUR BILL AND CENTER HILLS BILL THEN THE SIGNING AT TWENTY ONE IF FOR PURCHASES ONLINE. WHAT APPLY TO VAPING PRODUCTS? AS WELL DO I UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY. YOU DO GOTCHA THANKS. THANK YOU WE HAVE MISTER MATHIS THAN MISTER GALLAGHER IS ZERO ANYONE ELSE WANTING TO ASK QUESTIONS TO PONDER. ALL RIGHT SALUTE ME. RICHARD. THIS QUESTION RIGHT AWAY. SOLANA YOU SAW MY MY SON THAT WAS WITH ME -- LAST FRIDAY. AND HE'S ALREADY AND AT THE AGE OF NINE ASKED ME ABOUT VAPING. AND TALK TO ME ABOUT FLAVORS. BUT WHAT MY CONCERN IS IN AND HOPEFULLY YOU CAN ANSWER THIS SIR SOMEBODY UP THERE. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE WITH THE VAPING TECHNOLOGY FOR MARIJUANA VERSUS CIGARETTES AND WITH THE FLAVORS BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE FLAVOR. OILS THAT YOU CAN BUY A FOR SAY E. CIGARETTES IS CROSSED WITH THE SAME STUFF THAT YOU CAN DO. FOR VAPING MARIJUANA. SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE. AND HOW DO I EXPLAIN THIS TO MY CHILDREN. WHY I'M CERTAINLY NOT THE EXPERT ON THIS AND -- AND NOT A PAPER -- MY UNDERSTANDING. AND I INTO A FAMILIAR WITH EACH OF THE DIFFERENT PRODUCT LINES OF PERHAPS THE VAPING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION HERE -- MIGHT HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL. INFORMATION BUT THERE ARE I THINK OPENING CLOSE PRODUCTS MAKE THE OIL RELATES TO THE OPEN PRODUCTS VERSUS THE CLOTHES PRODUCTS -- SO IF YOU'VE SEEN A TRADITIONAL JUL. DEVICE FOR EXAMPLE I BELIEVE THAT'S A CLOSE PRODUCT THAT YOU CAN'T IN CERTAIN OIL INTO -- A WONDERFUL EVER SINCE HE'S OPEN PRODUCTS FOR YOU CAN USE DIFFERENT OILS AND I THINK WHAT YOU'RE REFERENCING. IS -- THE USE OF MARIJUANA WITH THOSE OILS IN THOSE PRODUCTS OR IS THAT IS THAT FOR THE THAT THAT'S THE QUESTION I MEAN BECAUSE THERE'S THERE'S ALL KINDS OF DIFFERENT THINGS OUT THERE. IN THE EVEN CANNOT WHERE WERE YOU I MEAN HI I JUST ONE ON AMAZON JUST JUST TO CHECK IN AND GO BOLD THE THE SAME QUESTION WHAT. POPS UP IS YOU CAN BUY THESE LITTLE TO THE OIL. THE YOU CAN USE FOR VAPING MARIJUANA -- VAPING. NICOTINE FOR THE E. THE IT GOES EITHER WAY. CHAU IF THE GOAL IS TO GET FLAVORED. TOBACCO AWAY FROM OUR KIDS WHAT'S TO STOP. THEM JUST BUYING THE OIL THAT'S GONNA BE ON SELF FOR MARIJUANA -- GETTING HOLE THAT. IN IF THE DEVICES. CROSS BACK AND FORTH WITH THE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS. THEN WHAT THE HELL ARE WE REALLY DON'T. AND WHY ISN'T THE BILL BROAD ENOUGH TO COVER BOTH. BECAUSE OF OUR GOAL IS TO KEEP OUR YOUTH FROM SMOKING AND VAPING. THEN THIS BILL CLEARLY ISN'T PRODUCT AND THAT'S THAT'S MY LARGEST CONCERN. IS WE WE'VE GOT KIDS ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEVEL THAT ARE TALKING ABOUT VPN. AND THESE PRODUCTS. WHETHER IT'S FOR E. CIGARETTES OR EMAIL HONOR WHAT WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL VAPING IS VAPING. EVERYTHING CROSSES OVER IN THE PRODUCTS IN THE TECHNOLOGY OR JUST GONNA COME OUT WITH IS GONNA CROSSOVER ANYWAY. SO. THERE'S NOT REALLY I I DON'T SEE HOW ARE YOU GOING TO STOP THIS UNLESS YOU ADDRESS VAPING AS A WHOLE. VERSUS GOING AFTER BIG TOBACCO VERSES BIG MARIJUANA THAT WE'RE GIVING GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES. TO SHOW A EXPLAIN IT TO ME. IF IF I MIGHT RESPOND THIS MASS APPRECIATE QUESTION -- I THINK PERHAPS YOUR MISUNDERSTAND MIS CHARACTERIZING PORTION BILL IN THE SENSE THAT THIS DOES APPLY. TO THOSE FLAVORS -- OPENED OR CLOSED SYSTEM -- CURRENTLY THERE -- THIRTY ONE THOUSAND LICENSED TOBACCO RETAILERS IN THE STATE. UNDER OUR PROPOSAL THE SALE OF THOSE FLAVORED PRODUCTS BE IT -- OILS -- IN AN OPEN ENDED PRODUCT FOR BE IT IN A CLOSED SYSTEM WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE. AT VAPE. SMOKE SHOP LOCATIONS WHERE -- IN LET ME READ YOU SPECIFICALLY THE DEFINITION SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND THAT -- ANY TOBACCO ONLY STORE WHICH GENERATES MORE THAN 60% OF ITS GROSS ANNUAL REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF TOBACCO PRODUCTS IMPAIR. FOR NINE DOES NOT SELL ALCOHOL OR FOOD FOR CONSUMPTION ON THE PREMISES -- AND PROHIBITS MINOR XIN ENTERING UNLESS THAT PERSON IS ACCOMPANIED BY HIS OR HER PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN SO THAT IS WHAT A TOBACCO ONLY STORE IS NOW WE KNOW -- AND ACTUALLY I WAS DISAPPOINTED WHEN I CONTACTED THE BILL WE THE PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH -- I HAD ONE OF THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES I'M SURE YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH THIS MATHIS WE TALKED A COUPLE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND THEY POINT BE OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS AND SAY WELL THE OTHER PERSON KNOWS -- WHEN I ASKED SPECIFICALLY HAS Y. WEARING GEO CORRECT THAT'S EXACTLY RIGHT -- BUT WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THERE'S ROUGHLY -- FIVE HUNDRED VAPE SHOPS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THERE'S CURRENTLY -- THIRTY ONE THOUSAND RETAILERS SO WHAT WE'RE DOING EFFECTIVELY THIS BILL AS IT RELATES -- TO FLAVORED PRODUCTS -- THAT WOULD BE APPLICABLE TO MARIJUANA WORE TRADITIONAL TOBACCO USE -- OR YOU CIGARETTE USE -- WOULD BE RESTRICTING FROM THIRTY ONE THOUSAND POINTS OF SALE DOWN TO LESS THAN A THOUSAND ARGUABLY I AM AND AS WE MOVE THE BILL FORD WILL DIAL THAT NUMBER AND TO THE EXACT NUMBER -- THAT IN IN IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE 20% MANDATE. ON STING OPERATIONS GIVES US A FAR MORE EFFECTIVE TOOL AND I WOULD PUSH BACK A LITTLE BIT I'VE HEARD TESTIMONY -- PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE TODAY THAT WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS BILL IS DOING NOTHING TO THE INDUSTRY TO THE MANUFACTURE. OF THESE PRODUCTS WELL IF YOU WERE MANUFACTURED MANY PRODUCT AND I TOLD YOU WE'RE GONNA TAKE THIRTY ONE THOUSAND PLACES YOU CAN SELL YOUR PRODUCTS TO REDUCE IT TO LESS THAN A THOUSAND I WOULD SUPPORT FOR THAT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT. ON YOUR BOTTOM LINE AT YOUR BUSINESS -- BUT WHAT THAT EFFECTIVELY DOES ALLOW US TO REGULATE IT BETTER AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PRODUCTS ARE NOT GETTING INTO THE HANDS OF OUR KIDS. IMAGE JORDAN WILL JUMP IN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. IN FURTHERANCE OF THAT POINT. I THINK IT'S SUPPORT UNDERSTAND UNDER THE STAKE ACT WHICH IS THE CURRENT SOARED INTO TOBACCO OF LONG CALIFORNIA. THERE'S ONLY THREE GOVERNMENT ENTITIES THAT HAVE THE JURISDICTION TO REGULATE THIS ONE'S THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S DOING ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. TO CURB TEEN DATING. THE OTHER IS -- THE DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AS WE'VE DISCUSSED IS UNDER RESOURCE WE TALKED THAN THAT WITH THEM AND THEY TOLD US THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO POLICE THIS ISSUE WITH OVER THIRTY ONE THOUSAND POINTS OF SALE IN CALIFORNIA. OKAY. AND THE THIRD IS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES I ASK. ALL SORTS LAW ENFORCEMENT FRIENDS OF MINE AND POLICE CHIEFS AND SHERIFFS AND NONE OF THEM ARE DOING ANTI TEEN DATING STINKS NOT A ONE THAT WE'VE HAD. EVER TALKED TO HER. SO WHAT AND UNDERSTAND TOO THAT THE PENALTIES IN TERMS OF THE RETAILERS THAT ARE SELLING -- ILLEGALLY SELLING TO MINORS. OR UNDER CURRENT LAUNDERED STEAK ACT OR ARE. ARE VIRTUALLY NOTHING IT TAKES GETTING CAUGHT THREE TIMES TO HAVE ANY SUSPENSION OF YOUR RETAIL LICENSE TO SELL TOBACCO. YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH IT TWICE GET CAUGHT RED HANDED I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET CAUGHT BECAUSE THERE'S NO BE DOING STINKS. OKAY BUT SAY YOU GOT CAUGHT SOME. SAY RANDY MISTER CUNNINGHAM YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT HELPING WITH THE BILL BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE SEEING IS NOT BEING ENFORCED AT ALL DOES THAT'S THAT'S UNDER CURRENT LAW. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE SO HERE'S HERE'S THE GOODNESS UNDER THIS BILL. YOU GET CAUGHT THE FIRST TIME THERE'S LICENSE SUSPENSION THE FINES TRIPLED AND AND WE'RE AS THE CHAIR SAID WE'RE RESTRICTING POINTS ACCESS FROM THIRTY SOMETHING THOUSAND CONVENIENCE STORES. TO ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS OR SO WHICH MAY GROW OVER TIME BUT NOW WE CAN TAKE OUR RESOURCES AND DEVOTED TO DOING STINGS WHERE WE KNOW THE KIDS ARE TRYING. TO BUY THE PRODUCTS AND THEN WE'VE GOT PUNISHMENT. ON THE RETAILERS THAT ARE SELLING ILLEGALLY WE DON'T HAVE EITHER OF THOSE THINGS UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THANK YOU THANK YOU. OUR NEXT. QUESTION COMES FROM MISTER GALLAGHER BUT I WANT TO BE REAL CLEAR ON ON THAT POINT. IT ISN'T NOBODY. DOING ANYTHING BECAUSE THE A TF IS DOING -- STING OPERATIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA COMES UNDER THE A TF ON THE FEDERAL SIDE THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT DEALS WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PUTTING REGULATION SO THE STATE. CAN ACTUALLY HELP -- MITIGATE THE ISSUES THAT WE'RE FACING HERE EXACTLY -- MISTER GRAY IF I IF I CAN CLARIFY THAT FURTHER -- THANK YOU MISTER BIGELOW -- IN CERTAIN THE A TF AND AND EFFORTS. MORE TOWARDS BLACK MARKET ACTIVITIES -- DO OCCUR -- WHAT WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS SHORT COMING UP AND ANY OF THE MEMBERS WHO PARTICIPATED -- IN THE STAKEHOLDERS SLASH INVESTIGATIVE MEETINGS INCLUDING ME WOULD PROBABLY HELP IS IT IS JUST NOT THERE'S NOT RESOURCES AND THERE'S NOT AFFECTED PLANNED THERE AND WE'RE NOT CONDUCTING STING OPERATIONS -- ON TOBACCO -- THE SALES TO MINORS AND AND FRANKLY THE PENALTIES WERE A BIT OF A JOKE AND CURRENT LAW I MEAN AS MISTER CUNNINGHAM TO SHARE WITH YOU YOU COULD SELL TWO TIMES. TO A MINOR WITH WITH WITH NO PENALTY ON THAT THIRD OCCASION -- THERE WERE SOME SUSPENSION OF YOUR SALES OF CENTER UNDER OUR BILL THE FIRST TIME YOU DO IT -- THERE ARE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES THE SECOND TIME YOU DO IT THERE ARE SERIOUS CONSEQUENCES AND THE THIRD TIME YOU DO IT YOU'RE NOT SELLING ANYMORE SO THESE ARE THESE ARE WERE SENDING A MESSAGE TO RETAILERS GET IT RIGHT -- AND ALSO IT DOES SO THE KIDS OKAY SO WE HAVE MISTER GALLAGHER THEN MR BONTA THAN MR COOLEY. SO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- A PRE SHEET TO THE AUTHORS HERE FOR TRYING TO THREAD THE NEEDLE HERE ON A AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. I WANT TO FOCUS IN ON ONE OF MY CONCERNS HERE IS THE BAND. AND THE LIMIT ON FLAVORS. AND THEN ALSO -- YOU KNOW THIS DISCUSSION ABOUT RESTRICTING IT TO I GUESS OR TO DO A TERM IN TOBACCO -- STORES -- I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY ABOUT PROTECTING MINORS. AND ENSURING THAT WE CRACKED DOWN ON THOSE WHO ARE SELLING TO MINORS THAT WE HAVE BETTER PROTECTIONS AS MISTER CUNNINGHAM WAS JUST TALKING ABOUT -- TO GET AT THE BAD ACTORS -- ALSO ON THE ADVERTISING I MEAN I YOU KNOW THE THINGS THAT ARE VERY CLEARLY EASING CARTOONS AND AND THINGS LIKE THAT ARE CLEARLY TRYING TO TARGET. USE. I THINK THOSE ARE GOOD PROVISIONS BUT I DO BELIEVE FUNDAMENTALLY THAT ADULTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE ADULT DECISIONS. AND I KNOW THAT. IT'S KIND OF HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT AN ADULT IS ANYMORE ESPECIALLY IN THIS BUILDING -- BECAUSE LET ME. I THINK WE'RE GETTING CLOSE TO HAVING THE NEXT QUESTION LET ME. LET ME CLARIFY BECAUSE IN THIS CONTEXT THAT'S YOU'RE AN ADULT IF YOU'RE. TWENTY ONE RIGHT. ANOTHER BILL THIS YEAR. IS PROPOSING A THE VOTING AGE TO BE SEVENTEEN YOU KNOW SO APPARENTLY YOU'RE NOT ADULT ENOUGH TO MAKE DECISIONS ABOUT SMOKING AND TOBACCO -- BUT YOU WELL FORMED ENOUGH TO MAKE A DECISION ABOUT GOOGLE. TO OFFICE. YOU KNOW WE ALSO HAVE V&lt;c.cyan&gt;ALSO&lt;/c&gt; PASSED LEGISLATION HERE THAT IF YOU COMMIT VERY SERIOUS CRIMES AGAINST PEOPLE IN YOUR TWENTY FOUR YEARS OLD -- YOU SHOULD BE TREATED AS AN ADULT BECAUSE YOU HAVE HOT BRAIN. SO YOU KNOW IT'S EASY TO BE CONFUSED AROUND HERE ABOUT WHAT AN ADULT IS BUT I DIGRESS -- BUT THE BOTTOM LINE IS WHEN YOU ARE AN ADULT WHATEVER YOU WANT TO DETERMINE THAT IS I THINK IT'S EIGHTEEN WHENEVER YOU'RE AN ADULT I THINK YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKE ADULT DECISIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO USE TOBACCO AND MAYBE YOU MAYBE YOU DECIDE YOU LIKE CERTAIN. FLAVORS. OR NOT AND I THINK BY US ARBITRARILY LIMITING WHAT FLAVORS SHOULD BE OUT THERE AND SAY THERE SHOULD ONLY BE THREE IN THE WORLD. TO ME IS. YOU KNOW NOT RESPECTFUL OF THAT FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE -- CERTAINLY WE CAN MAKE SURE THOSE ARE TARGETED TOWARDS USE -- YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT ADVERTISING THE BILL DOES THAT BUT LET ME. TO THREE YOU KNOW THREE FLAVORS TO ME I I DON'T SEE WHY WE WOULD DO THAT FOR PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE ADULT DECISIONS. AND ALSO YOU'RE LIMITING THE ABILITY THAT PEOPLE CAN AS AN ADULT AND HAVING THE RIGHT TO DO THIS. WHERE THEY CAN GET ACCESS TO A PRODUCT THAT THEY USE -- MANY PEOPLE GO TO GAS STATIONS AT THE OTHER MS STOP TO GET GAS AND THEY HAPPEN. TO YEAH PARTAKE IN THAT HABIT THAT MANY OF US THINK IS NOT GOOD FOR YOU. WE WOULD ALL SAY THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE THAT TELLS YOU THAT -- BUT THAT'S THEIR RIGHT AND WE'RE GONNA BE LIMITING THAT UNIVERSE SO I HAVE A I HAVE A PROBLEM FROM JUSTICE FUNDAMENTAL SENSE OF ADULTS. SHOULD BE ABLE TO MAKEADULT DECISIONS. AND THEN SECONDLY I THINK THERE'S SOME LEGITIMATE DISCUSSION HERE IT WAS REYES SAYS. THESE RESTRICTIONS ALSO SEEM TO MAYBE FAVOR CERTAIN BUSINESSES OVER OTHERS. AND I THINK THAT COULD BE PROBLEMATIC TO BECAUSE LOOK THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE IN THIS MARKET -- THEY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT THAT IS A MARKET I DON'T KNOW THAT WE SHOULD GET IN THE BUSINESS OF REGULATING. WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS YOU CAN HAVE? EXCEPT FOR WHAT WE'VE ALREADY LAID OUT IF YOU'RE IF YOU ARE TARGETING IN ADVERTISING TO KIDS THAT'S A PROBLEM. AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT. I THINK WE CAN DO THAT AND PROTECT USE LEGITIMATELY. WITHOUT DOING THE THE THREE FLAVORS AND THEN MAYBE MY FINAL POINT. DOES AGAIN THE YOUNG LADY FROM MODESTO HIGH GREAT JOB. BY THE WAY AND I'M GLAD YOU WERE ABLE TO GET HER HERE -- YEAH BUT THINGS AVE NOT CHANGED IT SEEMS TO ME. WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL RIGHT IT WAS ABOUT FLAVORED CHEWING TOBACCO RED AND? YOU KNOW THAT WAS THE THING THAT WAS GOING OUT THERE ALTHOUGH THE MARKET DID. ADDRESS THE SOMEWHAT IS IT PEOPLE VERY QUICKLY FOUND. THAT CHERRY SCHOOL. NOT A GOOD CHOICE -- ANYWAY IT'S WITH THAT I WILL I WILL IN MY POINTS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THOSE -- THOSE TWO THINGS. I THINK IF WE CAN CONSIDER THOSE IN THE FUTURE MAYBE YOU CAN RESPOND TO SIR THANK YOU -- MICHIGAN ALL RIGHT I WILL. I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND EXCEL YOUR THIRD QUESTION WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON YOUR FIRST. TWO AND THAT THE FIRST ISSUE RAISED -- WAS THIS ISSUE OF THIS INSTITUTION STRUGGLING TO FIND THE AGE OF MAJORITY AND I THINK YOU KNOW -- INPRIVATE CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN YOU AND I THAT I AGREE WITH YOU ON THAT SUBJECT IN FACT I THINK I'M ONE OF THE FEW PEOPLE IN MY PARTY IN THIS INSTITUTION. WHO VOTED AGAINST CHANGING -- THE AGE RESTRICTION. EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY ONE I DID THAT BECAUSE I ARRIVE AT THE AGE OF MAJORITY AT THE AGE THAT YOU CAN ENTER THE MILITARY. FORGET ASKED YOUNG PEOPLE TO DIE FOR THIS COUNTRY THEN THEY CAN MAKE IT DON'T CHOICES THAT'S MY POSITION IT'S BEEN MY POSITION IN MY VOTING RECORD CONSISTENT. HAVING SAID THAT OTHER PEOPLE FEEL DIFFERENTLY. THIS IS A IN PERFECT BILL THAT'S A PRODUCT OF COMPROMISE RIGHT AND ALL OF US CAN TAKE OUR RESPECTIVE IDEOLOGICAL POSITION TO BE PEER. RIGHT I CAN REFUSE TO SUPPORT ANYTHING THAT ADDRESSES -- SUBJECTS THAT IN OR INCONSISTENT PERHAPS MY PERSPECTIVE BUT WHAT WE ALL AGREE ON A WHICH ARE BROAD CONSENSUS AMONG COLLEAGUES AND MEMBERS IN MEETINGS ON IS THAT. EVERYBODY AGREES WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM WITH TOO MANY KIDS USE THESE PRODUCTS. AND SOME HAS TO BE DONE ABOUT IT SO WHETHER NOT WE CAN AGREE TO BAN ALL FLAVORS OR WHETHER NOT WE CAN AGREE ON THE NUMBER OF FLAVORS THAT ARE AVAILABLE WHERE. WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING TO GET A HANDLE ON THAT. AND I WOULD REMIND YOU THAT LICENSE BEING LICENSE TO SELL CERTAIN PRODUCTS IS A PRIVILEGE. RIGHT -- YOU MADE THE POINT WHILE YOU KNOW WHY SHOULD WE RESTRICT WHAT A BUSINESS CAN AND CAN'T SELL WELL. IF I WANT A BAR I CAN SELL UNCLE. IF YOUR LEMONADE STAND YOU CAN'T. WELL I'M NOT THEY THEY THEY THOSE IMPORTANT RESTRICTIONS AND THEN THERE'S PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS -- IT INVOLVED THE WHY WE MAKE THOSE TO TRY AND THAT'S NOT ANY DIFFERENT HERE RIGHT WE HAVE LICENSE READERS NOW WORK IN THIS CASE UNDER OUR BILL GOING TO HAVE. TOBACCO ONLY VAPE SHOP LOCATIONS IT'S A SPECIAL -- PART OF THE MARKET WE'RE GONNA ALLOW ALL FLAVORS TO BE SALT. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TRADITIONAL TOBACCO WHICH IS THE THREE I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO WHICH IS MEANT MENTHOL AND TRADITIONAL TOBACCO FLAVORED PRODUCTS -- SOLD -- AS THEY ARE TODAY IN THE STORES WIDELY AVAILABLE CAN MEAN STORAGE GROCERY STORES IT'S CENTER. SO I THINK IT'S ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE THAT WE LIMIT THE SALE THE PRODUCTS INTO A SMALLER NUMBER OF RETAIL LOCATIONS AS IT RELATES TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE TOO OFTEN FINDING THEMSELVES IN THE HANDS OF CHILDREN. WE OBVIOUSLY TO GET A BETTER HANDLE ON IT WELL LET'S TAKE IT FROM THIRTY ONE THOUSAND LESS THAN A THOUSAND AND THEN LET'S GO TO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE TOOLS. TO PROPERLY ENGAGE IN STING OPERATIONS SO THAT WE KNOW THOSE LOCATIONS ARE NOT SO MUCH AND ON TOP OF THAT JUST LIKE A BAR LET'S REMOVE THE ABILITY OF SOMEBODY UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE WHO CAN'T LEGALLY BUY A PRODUCT AND REPLACE. RIGHT YOU DON'T SEE SIXTEEN YEAR OLDS WALKING INTO BARS BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING IN A BAR THE SIXTEEN YEAR OLD CAN LEGALLY BUY RIGHT. AND SO IT'S NOT ONLY THAT THEY CAN'T BUY SOMETHING THERE BUT THEY CAN'T EVEN GO IN AND THAT'S THE THE CONSTRUCT WERE SETTING UP -- IN THIS BILL -- HI AGAIN. IS IT THE PERFECT ANSWER ALL FLAVORS -- MAYBE MAYBE NOT FOR SOME FOLKS -- YOU MISTER BERMAN ARTICULATED THAT MENTAL MEANT SOMETHING THAT IS ON HIS MIND -- MISTER BONTA MAY HAVE OTHER IDEAS ON HIS MIND. BUT THE EXCUSE OF WE CAN'T AGREE ON FLAVORS -- TO NOT MOVE FORWARD TO MAKING SURE THAT WE TAKE THESE PRODUCTS IN THE ACCESS IS PRODUCTS AWAY FROM CHILDREN IS JUST RIDICULOUS AND IT'S UNACCEPTABLE AND WE ALL OUGHT TO MAKE THE NECESSARY COMPROMISES. TO GET TO A PLACE WE CAN SUPPORT A BILL THAT'S GOING TO INCREASE ENFOCEMENT IS GOING TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS RIGHT AND WE'VE GOT A SUNSET IN HERE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO CONSISTENT WITH THE FDA WE CAN COME BACK TO THIS BODY AND IF IF IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH IT'S NOT STRINGENT AFTER THIS OTHER THINGS WERE MISSING. WE WILL REVIEW WILL PUT THOSE IN PLACE. JOINT AUTHORS ON ANYTHING WELL I SHOULD. AND YOU WERE QUITE ELOQUENT MISTER GRAY BUT I DID WANT TO JUST ADD -- TO MISTER CUNNINGHAM'S POINT THAT WE SHOULD LET THE PERFECT -- BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD I THINK IT'S ALSO ABOUT CREATING. STEPPING STONES OF STRATEGIC PROHIBITIONS AND LIMITATIONS. AND ALLOWING THOSE TO KIND OF BE FORMULATED AN INSTITUTIONALIZED SO THAT WE CAN THEN COME BACK AND SAY HOW CAN WE EXPAND ON THIS I DON'T THINK ANY ONE OF US -- IN THIS HOUSE IN THIS LEGISLATURE CAN REALLY SAY THAT WE'VE CREATED ST SILVER BULLET LEGISLATION THAT HAS FIXED ALL ISSUES IN ONE BILL. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE SHOULD SEE THIS AS THE FOUNDATION FOR BEGINNING TO GROW AND EXPAND THOSE LARGER CONVERSATION AROUND STOPPING OR PROHIBITING. THE SALE OF THE CIGARETTES TO MINORS. YOU KNOW WHO ARE STILL HAVING THEIR BRAIN DEVELOPED BY THE AGE OF TWENTY FIVE WHEN THESE PRODUCTS CAN BE DISASTROUS LEE ADDICTIVE RIGHT SO -- I THINK WHAT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IS THAT WERE RECOGNIZING WE'RE GOING AFTER THE RETAILERS RATHER THAN PUNISHING THE USE. AND TO DO QUITE OFTEN IN THIS BUILDING. MR BONTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO TAKE YOUR QUESTION I WOULD AND I WANT TO START BY EXPRESSING MY DEEP RESPECT AND APPRECIATION TO THAT THE JOINT AUTHORS FOR TAKING ON A VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE. AND FOR DOING VERY HARD WORK I I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS MEETING AFTER MULTIPLE HOURS WITH STAKEHOLDERS WITH WITH MEMBERS WITH OTHER AUTHORS TO TRY TO PULL TOGETHER A A SOLUTION AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND -- THE ART OF THE DEAL THE INSIGNIFICANCE OF COMPROMISED -- A NEED TO NOT HAVE THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY THE OF THE GOOD AND I I DO WANNA -- EXPRESS. MY SUPPORT FOR A CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THIS BILL AND INCLUDING -- THE PENALTIES AGAINST RETAILERS WHO DON'T COMPLY WITH THE LAW YOUR WILLINGNESS TO REMOVE THE PENALTIES AGAINST OUT THOSE WERE UNDER AGE I THINK THOSE ARE EXCELLENT. AND AND I APPRECIATE THEM VERY MUCH THAT THE PART THAT. HANGS ME UP -- RIGHT NOW IN THE CURRENT FORM OF THE BILL IS IS THE FLAVOR ISSUE -- I'M NOT ENTIRELY A PURIST ON IT BUT I THINK. THE MINT FLAVOR IS VERY ATTRACTIVE TO KIDS -- I KNOW YOU'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THIS COMPETING STUDIES WE HAVEN'T AGREED IN THIS ROOM. THAT HAPPENS SOMETIMES IN OUR DEBATE -- BUT FROM ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE FROM OTHER EVIDENCE THAT I'VE HEARD -- I THINK IT'S VERY ATTRACTIVE TO KIDS -- MAYBE MENTHOL LESS SO -- AND IN MY OWN DISTRICT I'VE HAD CITIES -- OAKLAND SAN LEANDRO ALAMEDA THAT HAVE -- BAND ALL FLAVORS EXCEPT FOR TRADITIONAL TOBACCO SO AT LEAST AT TIMES WITH SOMEBODY'S THERE THERE CAN BE THE POLITICAL WILL. TO GO THAT EXTRA MILE -- IN WAYS THAT I I THINK WE'LL PROTECT KIDS. SO. HAVING SAID THAT. I HOPE THE BUILDING DOES MOVE FORWARD TODAY I THINK IT WILL -- I DON'T BELIEVE I'M ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL UNLESS IT'S NECESSARY -- TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION -- BUT I AM HOPEFUL GIVEN THE PROCESS YOU'VE BEEN COMMITTED -- TO MISTER GRAY AND ALL OF THE JOINT AUTHORS TO LISTEN TO OTHERS -- TO TO BRING THE BEST IDEAS TO THE TABLE AND TO MAKE CHANGE WHEN NECESSARY TO GET A BETTER MORE. BILL -- THAT MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE I WILL BE ABLE SUPPORT SO I I THINK YOU. FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS RESPONSE AND AND I JUST I TAKE THAT AS AN OPPORTUNIST SAY. THAT'S ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY THAT -- THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WE'VE GOT THE FOUNDATION AND MISS KAMLAGER-DOVE SAID IT WELL -- OF WILL BE FOR DOING SOME REAL ON ACCESS TO PRODUCTS -- THE COMPONENTS IN PEACE THIS BILL THERE'S ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT RIGHT THERE'S ROOM FOR FRESH IDEAS NEW IDEAS -- MISS CALMER DOG JUST CAME TO US I THINK SHE'S MADE IMPROVEMENTS TO THE BILL -- IN HER COMMENTS IN HER ADDITIONS -- AND I WOULD WELCOME YOU KNOW FURTHER COMMENTS YOU GO FORWARD TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY YOU FEEL LIKE YOU HAVE TO LAY OFF -- YEAH WE WILL WE WILL CONTINUE DOWN THIS PATH AND WELCOME NEW IDEAS AND IF WE CAN -- STRAIGHT FROM THE PROVISIONS HAPPY TO DO SO -- BUT WE ALL FEEL STRONGLY THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE -- THIS YEAR. MR COOLEY NEXT AND THEN MISTER COOPER THAN MISTER GIBSON. I JUST WANT TO SAID THEY YOU KNOW ADAM I'M LOOKING THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A GOOD STRONG BILL SO MANY FRONTS. I DON'T ACTUALLY QUITE UNDERSTAND. THE PURPOSE OF THE SUNSET CLAUSE UNDER SECTION. SEVEN THAT'S THE PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT SAYS -- WE'RE ADDING SOME TO HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TOBACCO RETAILERS LICENSE SHALL NOT SELL FLAVORED CIGARETTES EXCEPT AS PROVIDED. WE DO ALLOW THE TOBACCO THE MEANT THE MENTAL FLAVORS -- IT INCLUDES A PROHIBITION ON SALE UNDER TWENTY ONE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR AGE VERIFICATION. I'M JUST UNDERSTANDING WHY. WHAT THE ROLE OF A SUNSET IS ON THAT TYPE OF PROVISIONS ACTUALLY? THOSE ARE RESTRICTIONS ON THE MARKET PLACE. AND WE CAN STILL BE BACK IN THAT DEBATE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE OF WORKERS SERVER WAS GOING ON IT SEES WE HAVE RESTATED THE RESTRICTIONS. AND THEN DO BY OPERATIONAL ALL TWELVE OR ONE MIDNIGHT ON DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE THOSE RULES THOSE RESTRICTIONS GO AWAY. IS IT'S LIKE WELL WHY DO WE DO THAT TO YOURSELF. IS FOR WERE GIVEN UP THE REGULAR REGULATION THE MARKET PLACE WE HAVE TO RE ENACTED. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION. MR COOLEY AND OVERALL SHOCK TO HAVE YOU ASK A QUESTION ABOUT PROCESS. BUT BUT YOU MADE A GREAT POINT WHY ARE WE YOU KNOW QUICKLY MOVING BACKWARDS AT THAT JUNCTURE BY -- THE INCLUSION SUNSET AND WHAT I WOULD SAY YOU IS WE'VE MADE GREAT EFFORT. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS TO TAKE VERY SERIOUSLY -- THE BODY OF WORK THAT HAVE BEEN DONE AT THE FDA -- WHERE THIS IS BEEN A HOT TOPIC IN MUCH WORK HAS BEEN DONE -- THEY HAVE A PROCESS. THAT THAT IS CONSISTENT -- TIMING WISE WITH AND WE LOOKED AT IT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THIS FORCE US BACK TO THE TABLE TO REVIEW -- THE ACTIVITIES AND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROVISIONS WOULD PUT THIS BILL INTO PERHAPS STRENGTHEN THEM AT THAT TIME -- BUT CERTAINLY I CAN SAY FOR MYSELF AND WILL SPEAK FOR ALL THE ALTERS THAT JUST OFF THE CUFF -- IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT I FEEL. COULDN'T TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE FOR SOME REASON YOU THOUGHT THE REMOVAL OF THE SUNSET. ADDED SOME -- GRAVITY TO THE BILL -- THAT CERTAINLY I'D BE OPEN MINDED ABOUT IT -- BUT HOPEFULLY THAT EXPLAINS AT LEAST THE THOUGHT PROCESS OF HOW WE ARRIVED AT THAT POSITION. YEAH HI I I WILL SAY YOU HAVE TWO SECTIONS WITH THE SUNSET. THE SECOND ONE I THINK MAKES PERFECTLY GOOD SENSE. THIS ONE IS MORE OF AN ISSUE -- I'M INCLINED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY BUT AS IT MOVES TO THE FLOOR. THAT'S THE THING THAT I MOSTLY FOCUSED ON I SORT OF THINK. FROM A PUBLIC POLICY STANDPOINT TO JUST LEAVE THE RULES IN PLACE -- TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO WE DON'T SLIDE BACKWARDS SO WHAT THE RESTRICTIONS ARE WE STILL ENGAGE DEBATE IS EMPTY IS DOING THINGS. BUT I THINK IT. IT MAKES CLEAR THAT WE WE MAINTAINING CALIFORNIA STRONG RESTRICTIONS. UNTIL A FUTURE LET'S SEE BY DECIDE YOU WANT TO CHANGE THEM. AND NOT THAT. THE CLOCK PAST MIDNIGHT AND NOW WE DON'T HAVE THOSE CONTROLS IN PLACE THAT. SEEMS A LITTLE. DOESN'T MAKE GOOD SENSE. THANK YOU FOR THE COM WILL CERTAINLY -- TAKE NOTE OF IT AND AND FOLLOW UP TO SEE IF WE CAN'T -- ARRIVE SOMEWHERE BETTER. THANK YOU. ON OUR NEXT QUESTION COMES FROM MISTER RUBIO. I MEAN RISK MR REGIS. YEAH SO I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BE HERE SOON AS RUN AROUND EVERYWHERE -- BUT I I YOU KNOW I DO APPRECIATE -- CO AUTHORS IS I'VE -- I'VE BEEN A PART OF THIS PROCESS AND YOU KNOW MY LIFE. PRIOR TO BE HERE THE LEGISLATURE'S I WORKED AT A HIGH SCHOOL VERY LARGE ICE OVER TWO THOUSAND STUDENTS. OTHERS TO SUPPORT MANAGER. SEMI TO HIGH SCHOOL. AND IN MY ROLE AS TO SUPPORT EVERY DAY I SAW THIS VAPING EPIDEMIC RIGHT BEFORE MY EYES IS UNBELIEVABLE. AND THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO QUESTION THAT YOU KNOW THE NEED TO ACT IS IS IS IS CLEAR -- AND AND AND AS A FATHER OF A YOUNG CHILD YEAH I REFUSE TO SIT ON THE SIDELINES AND DO NOTHING BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT AND SO THAT'S WHY I APPRECIATE. THIS APPROACH I APPRECIATE -- ARE CHAIR. MY COLLEAGUES THAT I WORK WITH OVER THE LAST -- TWO OR THREE MONTHS -- YOU KNOW OF THE FOR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK AND THEIR LEADERSHIP. THIS OBVIOUSLY ISN'T A PERFECT BILL -- BUT I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT -- YOU KNOW WE CAN REACH A A A GOOD COMPROMISE AND DO SOMETHING BECAUSE DOING NOTHING IN MY OPINION IS IS IS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE -- IN AS A NEW MEMBER HERE IN THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SACRAMENTO. I REALLY HAVE APPRECIATED THE STOP FULL -- AND THIS A COLLABORATIVE APPROACH THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN. YOU KNOW TO TO BE PART OF THIS WORKING GROUP OF OF LEGISLATORS THAT RECOGNIZE THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM AND WE HAVE THIS COMMITMENT AMONGST OURSELVES OR MONKS THIS LEGISLATION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT'S A CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE HEALTH ADVOCATES FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND TIRELESS FIGHT TO PROTECT PEOPLE FROM THE DANGERS OF ALL TYPES OF THE TOBACCO PRODUCTS -- AND FINALLY I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IT PROVIDES IMPORTANT VEHICLE TO CONTINUE THIS FIGHT AND WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT WE STRAIGHTEN THIS BILL BUT WE WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE STRAIGHTEN IT TOGETHER AND I BELIEVE THAT WE'LL GET THERE. THE THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS OF I APPRECIATE. THANK YOU. MISTER COOPER YOU WHAT NEXT THANK CHAIRMAN ONLY THINK I TRIMMING GREEN IS CLOCK JOINT AUTHORS BRING THIS BILL FOR THIS IMPORTANT. TO BRING IT IN LINE WITHTHE WAY THE ENFORCEMENT ALCOHOLS DONE IN BASICALLY WE'VE DONE NOTHING FOR VAPING WHATSOEVER. SO DIED GOODNESS TO REVISIT THIS THIS IS A START IT IS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW BECAUSE NOT BEING A FORCES AN ISSUE -- THE FDA SAYS THAT. THEY BECAUSE BEEN SMOKING. OBVIOUSLY YOU IN AMERICAN SOCIETY SAYS ON THERE -- STATEMENT BASED ON CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE USING. CURRENT GENERATION CIGARETTES IS LESS HARMFUL THAN SMOKING CIGARETTES. THE HEALTH EFFECTS A LONG TERM USER NOT NO WE DON'T KNOW WE'LL FIND OUT AT SOME POINT. FORGOTTEN SOMETHING. LIKE I SAID THEY HAVE THE ALCOHOL STINGS AND THAT'S BEEN DONE ALREADY TO ADDRESS THE ALCOHOL ISSUE IN TEAMS BUT NOTHING'S BEING DONE TO ADDRESS A BABY ISSUE. SO I THINK WITH THIS LEGISLATION EXIST WHERE WE NEED TO BE. I'VE GOT TIME TO MODIFY IT BUT TO SIT HERE AND DO NOTHING. IS UNACCEPTABLE. WE'RE GONNA BE SOMETHING IS THE VEHICLE I'M I'M SUPPORTIVE OF IT. AND IT'S A START I GUESS IT IS WORKING MOTION. MISS WHEN THIS YOU HAVE A QUESTION -- A COMMENT I WELL FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU FOR MAKING THE CHANGESTHAT YOU DID TO THIS BILL WITH RESPECT TO THE DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. FOR THE FOR THE MINERS I THINK THAT WAS. A WISE MOVE CERTAINLY THINK THAT WILL PROBABLY GET YOU SOME MORE VOTES IN THIS COMMITTEE -- I JUST FOR ME THE STICKING POINT IS. BANNING THE FLAVORS BECAUSE I GET SO MANY EMAILS FROM CONSTITUENTS SAYING THIS HELPED ME TO QUIT SMOKING DON'T TAKE THIS CHOICE AWAY FROM ME DO WHAT YOU CAN TO KEEP THE KIDS AWAY FROM IT. THAT'S THE STICKING POINT FOR ME -- AN ICE I MEAN I CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING WHICH IS THAT'S TERRIBLE THAT THE KIDS ARE USING THEM AND OTHER PEOPLE ARE HELPING THE MUSEUM BUT THAT BUT I AM AN ADULT AND I GET TO MAKE THIS DECISION THIS IS WHAT IS HELP ME AND WE CERTAINLY WANT. PEOPLE TO GET AWAY FROM SMOKING CIGARETTES AND ON ON TO SOMETHING THAT -- THE FDA SO FAR HAS SAID WE BELIEVE IS CERTAINLY LESS HARMFUL THAN REGULAR TOBACCO PRODUCTS -- HAVE YOU I KNOW YOU CHECK MADE ATTENDED CHANGES TO THIS BILL I HATE TO ASK THIS HAVE YOU CONTEMPLATED AT ALL. CHANGING THIS BAN ON THE FLAVORS BECAUSE FOR MORE FOR MORE I SAY YOU HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM RIGHT TO YOU CAN HAVE CHECK TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE NOT SELLING IT -- YOU HAVE THE INITIAL FIND -- THE ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL BURDEN WHICH WHICH I THINK IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO FRANKLY I MEAN THE HEAD ON THE FIRST TIME NOT THE THIRD TIME -- I THINK THAT'S IN IN AN EDUCATION CAMPAIGN I THINK IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE CAN PUT ALL THE ENFORCEMENT OF PLACE THAT WE WANT BUT IF. IF IF THE SCHOOLS AREN'T TALKING TO THE KIDS ABOUT THIS AND THEY'RE NOT SEEING IT EVERYWHERE JUST LIKE THEY SEE OTHER SIGNS OF IN BUS STOPS AND THINGS LIKE THAT WHERE THEY TALK ABOUT THE DANGERS OF SMOKING OR THE DANGERS OF DROWNING OR YOU KNOW. CAN SEE THIS STUFF IT'S IT ALL WORKS IN CONCERT TOGETHER THAT IS IMPORTANT. BY. GIVEN THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE ALL THOSE THINGS IN THE BILL I JUST. CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT YOU WOULD REALLY -- KIND OF DISSOLVED A LOT OF THE OPPOSITION THAT EXISTS RELATING TO THE FLAVORS BECAUSE ADULTS ARE FEELING LIKE. THAT'S THE CHOICE THAT WE'RE TAKING AWAY FROM THEM SO IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE WHERE SURETY THAT TOTALLY FINE. WITH ME -- IF YOU IF YOU DON'T MIND SHERMAN AVENUE -- RESPOND THAT WAS A QUESTION -- IT ALL JUST BOTH KINDA WHICH GROUP COMMENTS AS WELL AS THIS ONE DOES -- YEAH WHEN WE MET WITH THE MEMBER -- GROUP. WITH THE A. B. C. AND APART PUBLIC HEALTH. WHAT WE WERE CONFRONTED WITH WITH -- ABC WAS THAT THEY CAN DOCTOR I DON'T HAVE THE NUMBER OFF THE TOP MAY HAVE A THIRTY TO FORTY THOUSAND STING OPERATIONS -- PER YEAR. AND WE'RE WITH THE PART PUBLIC HEALTH AND SO HOW MANY STING OPERATIONS YOU GUYS CONDUCTING. THE ANSWER WAS I DON'T KNOW. HERE MISTER COOPER LAUGHING BUT THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S CERTAINLY -- WAS KIND OF OUR RESPONSE TO IS THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE -- I DON'T WANT TO I DON'T WANT TO PUT THAT FULLY ON THE DOORSTEP OF THE PART PUBLIC I THINK THE RESOURCE ISSUES I THINK THERE'S SYSTEMIC ISSUES THAT WE CAN BE OF ASSISTANCE TO PROVIDE THEM THE TOOLS. TO DO BETTER ENFORCEMENT BUT IT CERTAINLY CALLS THE QUESTION THAT WE NEED BETTER ENFORCEMENT. AND YEAH THAT THAT THAT'S THE PROMISE OF THIS IS HOW DO WE BALANCE THAT AND I THINK YOU KNOW MISS ONE IS THAT I TEND TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF ADULT CHOICE -- OUR PRODUCTS AND I STRUGGLED WITH THAT MYSELF -- BUT WE ARE WE HAVE -- AREAS OF LAW CHOCK FULL OF EXAMPLES WHERE YOU HAVE CONTROLLED PRODUCTS RIGHT THAT WE DON'T NEED GETTING IN THE HANDS OF KIDS THAT WE HAVE SOME LIMITED. AVAILABILITY OF COURSE SPECIAL LOCATIONS TO PURCHASE AND CERTAINLY BARS COME TO MIND PHARMACIES -- AND OTHER EXAMPLES. AND SO I I BELIEVE THIS BILL DOES STRIKE TO BOUNCE BECAUSE YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CESSATION ESPECIALLY -- CESSATION PRODUCTS THAT HELP PEOPLE TO GET OFF OF TRADITIONAL TACKLE AND AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES OF TESTIMONY -- THAT THIS IN FACT -- HAS HELPED A LOT OF PEOPLE THESE PRODUCTS -- IT'S STILL AVAILABLE TO A LEGAL ADULT ONLINE DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURER TO YOUR HOME -- THE COMBINATION OF OUR AGE VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE BILL ALONG WITH SENATOR HILLS -- PROVISIONS IN HIS BILL WHICH YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR LATER TODAY I THINK DO A GREAT DEAL TO STRENGTHEN -- THE ACCESS TO KIDS NAPA STILL PROVIDE A LEGAL PRODUCT TO AN ADULT AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT YOU HAVE -- LOCATIONS TOBACCO SLABS SLASH A BAIT SHOPS -- WHERE THIS IS AVAILABLE -- I THINK THOSE LOCATIONS EXIST I CERTAINLY KNOW THEY EXIST IN MY DISTRICT I ASSUME THEY EXIST IN THE DISTRICTS. OF YOU ALL AS WELL AND SO I THINK THOSE PRODUCTS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO THOSE EVIL WE ARE STRIKING A BALANCE HERE BETWEEN YOUTH ACCESS. AND POINT OF SALE -- FOR IN FORSMAN AND ADULT AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL PRODUCTS OKAY I JUST WANTED I WANNA MAKE SURE I'M CLEAR SO -- THE THE FLAVORS YOUR LIVE YOUR BILL IS LIMITING THE FLAVORS TO ONLY. THREE IS THAT RIGHT. OR ARE THEY ALL OKAY SO I KNOW MISTER GALLAGHER SOMEBODY SAID THAT EARLIER MAYBE WE SHOULD CLARIFY THAT SO THE REFERENCE TO THREE FLAVORS SEEMS TO BE. A TRADITIONAL TOBACCO MET MET BALL. NOW THE FTA SEES THOSE IS TRADITIONAL -- TOBACCO PRODUCTS AND MOST OF US ARE AWARE THAT -- MENTAL SLASH BAD CIGARETTES BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES -- AS WAS JUST BACK ON THE FLAVORS THAT WE ARE -- LIMITING -- TO THESE SPECIFIC RETAIL LOCATIONS ONLINE ALL THE OTHER FLAVORS RIGHT SO FRUIT AND CUCUMBER AND CREME BRULEE AND COOKIES AND CREAM -- COTTON CANDY YEAH THE THAT THESE TYPES OF SPECIALTY FLAVORS -- THAT WOULD BE LIMITED TO WEAR JUST ON THE LIMITED TO ONLINE DIRECTLY FROM MANUFACTURER WITH THE AGE VERIFICATION TECHNOLOGY IN THE SIGNATURE -- END OR AT A TOBACCO BAIT SHOP LOCATION WHICH EXISTS IN I THINK ALMOST EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICT HAS DIED WHEN THE COMMUNITIES THERE ARE THOSE STORES SO YOU CAN GO TO THE STORES YOU CAN LEGALLY BY PARTY GOT TO BE TWENTY ONE TO GET IN THE DOOR. I DO HAVE A TWENTY ONE PERSON RIGHT. WHAT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MILITARY IDEA WHICH I COVERED EARLIER? OKAY SO THEN JUST COULD YOU CLARIFY THEN THIS DISCUSSION WE'RE HAVING ABOUT MEN TO MENTAL ON THOSE TRADITIONAL TOBACCO FLAVORS WILL BE AVAILABLE. IN ALL THE LICENSE RETAIL LOCATIONS AS THEY ARE TODAY. SO WALMART AND STUFF LIKE THAT WHEREVER YOU CAN FIND THOSE PRODUCTS TODAY YOU WOULD BE ABLE TO FIND THEM -- AFTER THE SIGNING OF THIS BILL AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS BILL -- IF THEY ARE MEANT MENTAL OR TRADITIONAL TOBACCO AND IF THEY ARE BUBBLE GUM CAPTAIN CRUNCH COTTON CANDY COOKIES AND CREAM RATHER YOU MAY HAVE TO GO TO A SPECIAL TO LOCATION. OKAY GOT IT THAT IS HELPFUL THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT -- I WILL JUST ADD AS A FINAL COMING BECAUSE THEY KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE BUT THESE. COMPANIES ARE TARGETING KIDS FOR SURE NOT A SHAMEFUL. SORRY THAT SHAMEFUL I HAVE. OUR TWO YOUNGEST BOYS ARE MIDDLE SCHOOLERS AND THAT STOPS EVERYWHERE IN MIDDLE SCHOOL AND IT'S EIGHTY ARE I AM CERTAIN THAT. MANY OF THE PARENTS HAVE NO IDEA WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE FIND IT IN THEIR KIDS BACKPACK AND I TALKED OUR BOYS ABOUT IT AND THEY GET IT THE WAY YOU KNOW WE GOT. STUFF LIKE THAT I GUESS WHEN WE WERE KIDS WHICH IS YOU HAD SOMEONE ELSE BY FORTY EXCEPT NOW THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE ENTREPRENEURIAL AND SPIRIT. AND OTHER SELLING WITH THE MARKUPS OUT THERE IS THAT BUT THE I THINK THIS IS JUSTIFIED IN GOING AFTER THE MANY FACTORS AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO NOT TARGET. KIDS AND NOT TRY TO GET THEM HOOKED ON TO SOMETHING THAT -- ISN'T IT IS AN ADULT. BEHAVIOR. AND IF IF I MIGHT ADD ONE ADDITIONAL COMMENT AND THIS ONE IS THAT THAT YOU BRING TO MIND WHICH IS MANY OF YOUR FROM OVER THE MSA THE MATTER SETTLED AGREEMENTS THAT WERE RESULT OF TOBACCO LITIGATION. MANY YEARS AGO AND SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE NATIONAL AGREEMENTS AS IT RELATES TO ADVERTISING TO USE ANOTHER. DO NOT THE DHARMA PLUGGABLE -- TO THEY PEARY CIGARETTES RIGHT SO THAT'S ONE OF THINGS WE ALSO ACCOMPLISH THIS BILL AS WE APPLY SOME OF THOSE ADVERTISING RESTRICTIONS -- FURTHER STRENGTHENED TODAY BY THE MEMBERS WERE TAKING SPECIFIC -- TO SPORTING FACILITIESOTHER VENUES THAT -- OBVIOUSLY HAVE A DISPROPORTION NUMBER OF YOUNG PEOPLE IN ATTENDANCE. I JUST WANTED TO ALSO AND THAT -- YOU KNOW I TO HAVE YOUNG KIDS I HAVE A TWELVE YEAR OLD AND A FIFTEEN YEAR OLD AND ACTUALLY LATE LAST YEAR I ASKED MY FIFTEEN YEAR OLD. YOU KNOW OUR KIDS VAPING BECAUSE I YOU KNOW I DON'T SMOKE AT ALL I NEVER HAPPENED SO I REALLY DIDN'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT IT. AND THE SIMILAR TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CUNNINGHAM SHE'S LIKE OH MY GOD ARE YOU KIDDING ME THEY DO IT ALL THE TIME IN BETWEEN YOU KNOW GOING TO CLASS IN THE HALLS LIKE CENTER. YOU KNOW BUT FOR ME I DON'T SEE IT BECAUSE I DON'T SMELL IT. YOU KNOW AND SO IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU THINK ABOUT BUT I ALSO ASKED HER OKAY SO WELL WHAT KIND OF FLAVORS ARE YOU USING BECAUSE I'M JUST NOW LEARNING ABOUT THIS. AND SHE TALKED ABOUT ALL OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE FLAVORS A CUCUMBER THAN MEN. YOU KNOW THE COTTON CANDY THOSE ARE NOT TYPICAL FLAVORS ARE YOU'RE GONNA BUY WHEN YOU'RE AN ADULT GOING TO A STORE TO EITHER GET VAPING. JUICE OR TO BUY REGULAR TOBACCO AND SO THIS IS REALLY YOUTH CENTRIC I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO JUST SAY. THAT IT'S A LUXURY TO BE A PURIST WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LEGISLATION. WE'VE HAD BILL REFORM BEFORE US WE'VE HAD WILD FIRES BEFORE AS WE'VE HAD RENT CONTROL BEFORE US NONE OF THOSE PIECES OF LEGISLATION WERE A 100% AMAZING GRACE WHEN THEY CAME BEFORE US BUT WE VOTED ON THOSE BILLS TO KEEP THEM ALIVE TO KEEP THE CONVERSATION GOING. AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ASKING THIS BODY TO CONSIDER AS WE CONTINUE TO TACKLE A VERY. DIFFICULT AND INVASIVE -- ISSUE AN EPIDEMIC THAT'S HITTING ALL OF US ACROSS ALL OF OUR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] SO -- SCENE NO ONE HAVING RALLIED TO THE FOR MORE QUESTIONS -- MR GRAY I BELIEVE WE'VE HEARD THE TESTIMONY PRESENTED -- THIS BILL IS DOES ENJOYED TO PASS AS AMENDED -- PUSHING THIS -- ACTION ITEM OVER TO THE HEALTH. COMMITTEE I THINK EVERYONE KNOWS THAT WILL BE ANOTHER SHIP SHOT AT THIS BILL IN FACT I THINK YOU HEARD SEVERAL COMMENTS MADE BY MEMBERS ABOUT MAYBE MAKING A TWEAK HERE AND THERE.

MY PEERS CLASSMATES AND CLOSEST FRIENDS HAD FALLEN DOWN THE PATH OF ADDICTION BECAUSE BY THESE HORRIFIC TOBACCO PRODUCTS. EACH DAY THAT I VOLUNTEER MY TIME AND MY EFFORT. TO THIS CAUSE IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT ALL OF THESE FRIENDS THESE CLASSMATESIN THESE YOUNG LOS LIVES THAT I KNOW THAT I'VE ENTERED A LIFETIME OF ADDICTION DUE TO BIG TOBACCO AND THEIR DEVIOUS MARKETING AND TACTICS. BIG TOBACCO HAS LONG TARGETED THE YOUTH AUDIENCE UP FROM SMOKING CARTOON CHARACTERS IN THE PAST IN NEWSWEEK ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES WITH THE MERRY OUT OF FLAVORS THAT TARGET YOUTH IT IS APPARENT THAT MY GENERATION AND THE YOUTH OF CALIFORNIA -- BEING TARGETED FOR PROFIT OFF OF OUR SUFFERING IF I'M BEING BLATANTLY HONEST NOW THESE TACTICS HAVE COMPLETELY WORKED. MY PEERS HAVE BEEN HYPNOTIZING LOWERED BY THESE DEVICES THAT RESEMBLE THEIR PHONES OR EVEN THEIR WATCHES. THEY'VE BEEN LEARNED BY THESE ENTICING FLAVORS THAT REMIND THEM OF THEIR CHILDHOOD SUCH AS BLUE RASPBERRY OR FRUITY BLAST NOW I AM UNABLE TO GO A DAY WITHOUT HEARING TALKS ABOUT THESE ALLURING FLAVORS. ARE GETTING A PLUME OF VAPOR BLOWN IN MY FACE IN THE BATHROOM AT SCHOOL. I HEAR TALK FROM MY PEERS ABOUT HOW SIMPLE IT IS FOR THEM TO BUY THESE -- ADDICTIVE PRODUCTS BY BUYING THEM ONLINE THEY SIMPLY ENTER THEIR CREDIT CARD AND PUT IN THEIR ADDRESS AND SOON ENOUGH THERE IS IT THEIR ADDICTION IS REFILLED WHAT WE NEED NOW IS CHANGE AND THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT HARDER FOR E.

FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH WILL REQUIRE ELECTRONIC CIRCUIT MANUFACTURERS TO SUBMIT A PHYSICAL DESCRIPTION AND PHOTOGRAPH OF EACH TYPE OF DEVICE THEY SELL TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH. AND IMPOSE A REASONABLE FEE ON MANUFACTURERS TO COVER THEIR DEPARTMENTS COSTS OF ADMINISTERING. THE PROGRAM. OUR DESPITE LAWS PROHIBITING THE SALE OF ELECTRONICS CIGARETTES TO PEOPLE UNDER TWENTY ONE YEARS OF AGE THAT THEY USE HOUSE RAPIDLY BEEN INCREASING. WE ARE SEEING DEVICES ON THE MARKET THAT LOOK LIKE USB PORTS FLASH DRIVES AND EVEN PENS COMMON OBJECTS THAT EASILY GO UNDETECTED. I KNOW WE'VE HAD A BIG DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW ABOUT TO BACK COOL AND HOW THEY'RE TARGETING CHILDREN JUST HAVE BY WAY OF EXAMPLE AND MY TEACHER COLLEAGUES UP HERE ON THE DíAS. YOU KNOW NOW THEY HAVE LIKE HIGHLIGHTERS THIS IS ONE OF THE OBJECTS THIS IS WHAT OUR HIGHLIGHTERS LOOK IN THE CLASSROOM. THIS LOOKS LIKE A PHONE BATTERY. IF WE GO BY. KEEP OUR VOICES DOWN JUST A LITTLE BIT AND SHOW RESPECT TO OUR SENATE DOT COM THANK YELL AT AND THIS I'VE SEEN IN THE CLASSROOM OUR KIDS USE MECHANICAL PENCILS. THIS IS A LITTLE CASE THAT LOOKS LIKE WE PUT THE PENCILS AND SITE SO CLEARLY THEY ARE TARGETING OUR CHILDREN THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THEY'RE ON BRING THAT TO THE CLASSROOM AND NOT IN FOR TEACHERS IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO DETECT THE SIDE I'M CELL SO ONCE AGAIN MY EXPERIENCE INFORMS MY DECISION IN THIS BILL IN TERMS OF NOT KNOWING WHAT TO LOOK -- FOR I'VE HAD PEOPLE ASK WELL CAN'T THEY GOOGLE THE ITEM BUT I'M NOT A SMOKER EITHER AND I DON'T HAVE CHILDREN SO. I WOULD HAVE NO REASON TO BE GOOGLE THE ITEMS THAT THE PERTAIN TO TO EIGHTEEN AND SO AGAIN THESE ITEMS CAN EASILY BE HIDDEN IN THE CLASSROOM IN THE BACK OF THE LIBRARY. AND SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE INSURE THAT TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS AND ADMINISTRATORS. ARE -- AWARE OF WHAT KIND OF PRODUCTS TO LOOK FOR SO ANY HELP TODAY I WANT -- TO GIVE MEGAN FOR A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOLS TO ANY OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AN AUNT -- CORE A PARENT ADVOCATE FROM THE ANTI VAPING ALLIANCE HAVE WE CAN.

HI MY NAME IS MEGAN FOR IT I'M A NEWLY GRADUATED SENIOR FIRMWARE AMERICANO HIGH SCHOOL AND I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY EIGHT BY SENATOR RUBIO. I'M HERE TODAY TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE WITH ELECTRONIC CIGARETTES AS WELL AS WHAT I'VE LEARNED ABOUT THEM. A FEW YEARS AGO I DON'T KNOW ANYONE MY AGE TO USE ELECTRONIC TOBACCO PRODUCTS NO WHAT I HAVE EVER CONSIDERED USING ONE MYSELF. I BECAME FAMILIAR WITH THE NEWER SLEEKER VAPES ABOUT A YEAR AGO WHEN A FRIEND TAUGHT ME HOW TO ONE HELL TO GET A HEAD RUSH -- BONDS FROM HIS PREVIOUS PRIOR. THIS WAS A TINY METALLIC BOX THAT FIT IN OUR HANDS AND WAS DISCREET ENOUGH TO HIT IN CROWDED RESTAURANTS WITH THEIR PARENTS THE NEXT ROOM AND EVENTUALLY EVEN DURING CLASS. IT HONESTLY DID SEEM HARMLESS REST OF THE TIME AND IT TASTED LIKE GREEN APPLE. WHAT I DIDN'T REALIZE BACK THEN WAS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE CHEMICALS IN TORRANCE CIGARETTES MAY NOT INJURED MAY NOT EXISTING PAGES MOST BRANDS OF JEWS STILL CONTAIN CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCES AS WELL AS INCREDIBLY CONCENTRATED AMOUNTS OF NICOTINE THAT I GOT ADDICTED TO VERY QUICKLY? I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT THE RUSH I FELT WAS DUE TO NICOTINE INCREASING MY DOPAMINE ADRENALINE LEVELS MY BLOOD PRESSURE AND MY HEART RATE. AND I CERTAINLY DIDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT I WOULD EVENTUALLY NEED AFFECTS IN ORDER FOR MY BODY AND BRAIN TO FUNCTION NORMALLY. THERE'S SO MUCH WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE AFFECTS OF THE CIGARETTES AND WITH THE CONCENTRATE ACTION OF NEWER AND MORE DISCRETE DEVICES SOME DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT THEY LOOK LIKE. I BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL WOULD HELP EDUCATE THE GENERAL PUBLIC MORE SPECIFICALLY TEACHERS AND PARENTS ON WHAT TO LOOK FOR IN THEIR CLASSROOMS AND HOMES. PUTTING DESCRIPTIONS AND PHOTOS OF EVERYDAY DEVICE ON THE MARKET AND SENDING THIS INFORMATION OUT TO THE SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO HELP EDUCATORS AND PARENTS REALIZE. WHAT EXACTLY THEIR KIDS ARE USING AND TAKES STEPS TO HELP THE KIDS REALIZE WHAT USING WILL DO TO THEM? THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND I ASK FOR YOUR AYE THE GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN GRAY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS A IN DELCO OR A SCHOOL VOLUNTEER AND PARENT OF THREE TEENAGERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M PROUD TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SENATOR RUBIO IS. SB. FIVE THIRTY EIGHT SEXY SLEEK. AND SECRETLY HIDDEN IN THE POCKETS BACKPACKS AND SLEEVES OF OUR MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. HOW COULD WE HAVE KNOWN THAT THE SMALL VAPING DEVICES COULD DELIVER SUCH A DEVASTATING BLOW TO THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR CHILDREN? SB FIVE THIRTY EIGHTHS NEW DESCRIPTION AND PHOTO REQUIREMENTS OF ELECTRONIC SMOKING DEVICES WILL ALLOW THE FIRST LINE OF DEFENSE FOR PARENTS TEACHERS AND SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS. SO THAT WE MAY HAVE A MEANS OF EARLY INTERVENTION IN THE MIDST OF THIS TEENAGE BEEPING EPIDEMIC. I VOLUNTEER AT RIO AMERICANO HIGH SCHOOL IN THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. IN RESPONSE TO HIGH SUSPENSION RATES STUDENTS WITH NICOTINE POISONING OR AN ADDICTION COUNSELING AND FRUSTRATED SCHOOL PERSONNEL I CREATED THE ANTI VAPING ALLIANCE. AND HAVE BEGUN A MULTI PRONGED STRATEGY TO ADDRESS THIS HEALTH CRISIS. WE HAVE ON ENDING WORK TO DO. SOME STUDENTS AND PARENTS IN OUR GROUPS IN OUR GROUP CAME TO THE CAPITOL LAST WEEK. WE PUSH. EXCUSE ME WE PUSHED AROUND A CART FILLED WITH THESE CONFISCATED VAPING DEVICES FROM TO AREA HIGH SCHOOLS. WE MET WITH SEVERAL STAFFERS AND LAWMAKERS IN NEARLY EVERY PERSON WE MET IN THE OFFICES IN THE LUNCH ROOM AND IN THE ELEVATOR SOFT THREE OR MORE DEVICES THAT THEY HAD NEVER SEEN BEFORE ON THAT CART. FOR OUR STUDENTS. STUDENTS USE OF THESE DEVICES WILL DO IT WILL DAMAGE THE SYNAPTIC DEVELOPMENT OF THEIR BRAINS AND CAN DELIVER A LIFETIME OF ADDICTION. RIGHT NOW THESE DEVICES ARE WREAKING HAVOC IN OUR SCHOOLS. TURNING OUR BATHROOMS LOCKER ROOMS AND CLASSROOMS INTO VAPE ROOMS. WHETHER DEVICE MANUFACTURERS DESIGN THESE TO BE DISCREET. OR DESIGN THEM TO BE DECEPTIVE WE MUST REQUIRE THEM TO PROVIDE PHOTOS AND DESCRIPTIONS WE HAVE TO KNOW WHAT WE'RE LOOKING. FOR WE WEREN'T PREPARED FOR THIS EPIDEMIC AND MAKE NO MISTAKE YOUTH VAPING PREVENTION. IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE LARGER STRATEGY BUT WITH YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY. YOU WILL BE ARMING US WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED THAT WILL HELP US PROTECT THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN THANK YOU. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY SUPPORT TODAY. MORNING CARVALLO AT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. EXACTLY COR ABOUT CALIFORNIA DENTAL ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO IN SUPPORT. GARY COOPER REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION ORAL AND MAXILLOFACIAL SURGEONS IN SUPPORT. BLAKESHELTON ONLY A MEMBER OF THE INTERFAITH ALLIANCE IN THE STUDENT AT RIO AMERICANO ALSO IN SUPPORT. OKAY ADICIONAL TESTIMONY SUPPORT. SEEING NONE WE HAVE ANYONE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS MELENDEZ. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANT TO KNOW -- SO IT REQUIRES A PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO CONDUCT A PUBLIC OUTREACH CAMPAIGN TO NOTIFY THE SCHOOLS DOES NOT REQUIRE THE SCHOOLS TO THEN SHARE THAT INFORMATION WITH PARENTS. BUT IS IS THERE FUNDING ATTACHED TO THIS BIRD. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO DO THIS OUT REACH. WELL THEY'RE ALREADY OVERSEE A LOT OF DEPARTMENTS THAT ALREADY ARE IN PLACE AT THIS ONE IN PARTICULAR THE WAY WE WANTED TO APPROACH IT IS COST NEUTRAL WE WANT THE MANUFACTURERS. TO REGISTER EACH NEW PRODUCT THAT COMES WITH THE FEE AND THAT FEW WILL GO TOWARDS -- THE OF THE COST OF EDUCATING THE PUBLIC. SO YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE ENOUGH NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED THAT WOULD COVER THAT FEES ASSOCIATED WITH. NOTIFYING EVERY SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE. SO IT'S NOT NECESSARILY ABOUT NOTIFYING THE THE ENTIRE -- STATE IT'S WE WANT TO HAVE A CENTRALIZED -- WEBSITE WHERE WE CAN POST ALL THE ITEMS AND THEN SCHOOLS WILL BE NOTIFIED THAT THEY KIND. OF LOOK WHAT TO LOOK FOR WE'RE ALSO WORKING ON HAVING -- THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS REQUIRE THAT THE PAGE WITH ALL THE PRODUCTS BE POSTED ON THE AND THE STAFF LOUNGE I WAS A TEACHER BEFORE YOU KNOW WE SIT THERE WE EAT AND WE HAVE CAL OSHA AND ALL THESE REQUIREMENTS. IT WOULD BE REALLY SIMPLE TO PUT UP A POSTER OF ALL THE PRODUCTS OR THEY CAN SEE IS JUST A WAY OF POINTING PARENTS TO A WEBSITE WHERE THEY CAN FIND PRODUCTS. AND THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE TIME TO INFORM SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HAVE THEM POSTED BUT IT REALLY IS GOING TO BE MINIMAL COST TO THIS. OKAY I THINK YEAH. WELL NORMALLY WE DON'T ALLOW THIS FORM OF NEPOTISM BUT WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW -- MYSTERY WOULD ASK MISS RUBIO QUESTION. THANK YOU I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I'M A VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY AS A FORMER SCHOOL TEACHER. JUST THE PRODUCTS THAT YOU PASSED AROUNDWHAT THEY WERE INCREDIBLE I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT EVEN THE THE FLASH DRIVES OR EVEN THAT THE US BE -- DEVICES WERE PART OF THAT SO I WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS SENATOR RUBIO.
