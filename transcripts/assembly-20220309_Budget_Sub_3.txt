WE HAVE HAVE IN ALL OF OUR MEETINGS THUS FAR THIS YEAR TODAY WE ARE HAVING AN IN PERSON HEARING IN THE STATE CAPITAL WE'RE IN ROOM FOR FORTY SEVEN. OUR PANELISTS ON THE AGENDA HOWEVER ARE GOING TO BE APPEARING REMOTELY. THOSE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN PERSON MAY DO SO WHEN WE OPENED PUBLIC COMMENT AT THE END OF THE HEARING. AFTER THOSE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM HAVE SPOKEN WE WILL ALLOW PHONE TESTIMONY. THE PHONE NUMBER TO CONNECT IS ON THE COMMITTEE WEBSITE SHOULD ALSO BE ON THE SCREEN IF YOU'RE WATCHING OVER THE INTERNET. THE TELEPHONE NUMBER IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN IF WE CAN GET THIS MIKE. LOWERED JUST A LITTLE BIT WE GOT SOME ECHO OR THE SPEAKER WE GOT SOME ECHO IN THE ROOM- AGAIN THE PHONE NUMBERS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO. EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN ACCESS CODE ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR FOUR SEVEN. THE ACCESS CODE AGAIN IS ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR FOUR SEVEN. IF YOU ENCOUNTER ANY PROBLEMS PLEASE CONTACT THE ASSEMBLY BUDGET COMMITTEE AT. WILL TRY TO ASSIST YOU. ALL COMMENTERS WILL HAVE UP TO ONE MINUTE TO SPEAK. WILL NOT BE TAKING ANY VOTES TODAY. WE WILL BEGIN WITH OUR THREE DISCUSSION ITEMS AND WHEN WE HAVE A CORE- IT'S A NON PRESENTATION ITEMS OR NOT TAKING A VOTE ON THAT EITHER SO I WILL BEGIN- WITH- THREE DISCUSSION ITEMS AND- WILL ALLOW OUR PANELISTS TO GIVE THEIR TESTIMONY FIRST. THEN OPEN IT UP TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS AFTER THE DISCUSSION ITEMS COMMITTEE MEMBERS MAY ASK QUESTIONS. OR OTHER COMMENTS ABOUT ANY NON DISCUSSION ITEMS THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO. AND OF COURSE WE WILL END WITH PUBLIC COMMENT SO WE BEGIN TODAY. WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE AGAIN CAN IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN TURN DOWN AND REDUCE THE ECHO IN THE ROOM. FROM THE SPEAKER I FEEL LIKE I'M AT A- CONCERT- GETTING READY FOR THE SHOW HERE. I ONLY WISH. WE ARE GOING TO BEGIN WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND TO KICK THAT OFF WE HAVE THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE C. E. C. THROUGH BY. ARE YOU THERE MORNING MEMBERS OF MY COMING THROUGH OKAY. YES YOU CERTAINLY ARE. I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN DELIVER ON- ANYTHING CLOSE TO A ROCK CONCERT BUT I'LL GIVE IT A TRY YEP WE'RE TALKING WE ALWAYS WANT TO COME RIGHT. WILL PROVIDE LIVE THE DREAM- RIGHT- AS YOU NOTED MY NAME IS DREW BONE ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND I GOT A NUMBER OF THINGS TO PRESENT TO YOU TODAY SO I WILL SPEAK VERY QUICKLY BUT I'LL START BY SAYING CALIFORNIA HAS MADE TREMENDOUS PROGRESS IN THE CLEAN ENERGY SECTOR AS THE L. A. REPORT NOTED IN TWENTY TWENTY CALIFORNIA'S POWER BY JUST SHY OF SIXTY PERCENT. CLEAN ENERGY AND 36% OF THAT WAS FROM RENEWABLES IN ADDITION THE REPORT NOTED THAT THE ELECTRICITY SECTOR SEVERAL YEARS AGO ACHIEVED THE SB THIRTY TWO GOAL OF 40% GHG REDUCTIONS AS AGAINST NINETEEN NINETY BASELINE BY TWENTY THIRTY. WE DID A DECADE EARLIER SEVERAL YEARS AGO SO AGAIN GREAT PROGRESS BUT- NORMALLY THE TASK. BEFORE US IS. S. N. FROM THE S. B. HUNDRED. THAT WE- JUST ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR THIS WAS A JOINT REPORT WITH SEVERAL AGENCIES. THAT REPORT SHOWED THAT A 100% CLEAN ENERGY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE THIS ACHIEVABLE. THAT'S GOOD NEWS BUT TO GET THERE ARE GONNA NEED APPROXIMATELY TRIPLE ARE ELECTRICITY GENERATION FROM SOLAR AND WIND AND WE'RE GONNA NEED TO INCREASE BATTERY STORAGE BY MORE THAN THAT. PACKAGE BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING THAT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM ME AND FROM SEVERAL OF MY COLLEAGUES IS A TWO BILLION DOLLAR PACKAGE ACROSS SEVERAL DEPARTMENTS. IN THE CDC WOULD MANAGE A TOTAL OF ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION OF THAT. IS DESIGNED TO DO A COUPLE THINGS THE FIRST IS K. KEEP OF A LASER FOCUS ON RELIABILITY THAT'S REALLY JOB ONE IS BEING RELIABLE. SECOND SPUR INVESTMENT AND GENERATE JOBS. THIRD WE WANT TO LEVERAGE THE LARGE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THIS AREA. AND FINALLY WE WANT TO PROMOTE EQUITY ACROSS CALIFORNIA COLLUDING IN TRIBAL AREAS SMALL IN COMPARISON UNDERREPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. EACH NEXT WEEK YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR THE ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL ON TRANSPORTATION DECARBONIZATION. TODAY I'M GONNA TALK TO YOU ABOUT THREE OTHER AREAS ELECTRICITY ELECTRICITY GENERATION CARP DECARBONISATION. BUILDING DECARBONIZATION AND INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION. LET'S START WITH ELECTRICITY SYSTEM THE CARD THERE ARE FOUR TOPICS ALL PRESENT FIRST IS LONGER RATIONS STORAGE WHERE WE'RE SEEKING TRAINER EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO OUR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE. UNDER HIS SWORD WILL ENABLE US TO. KEEP THE LIGHTS ON WHEN THE GRID GOES DOWN FOR ONE REASON OR ANOTHER OR WHEN PRINTABLES ARE ACTIVE WHEN THE WIND ISN'T BLOWING THE SUN IS SHINING. IN THEIR THREE REAL WELL PRIMARY DRIVERS WE'VE GOT WHEN WE WHEN WE LOOK AT LONG DURATION STORAGE THE FIRST IS DIVERSIFICATION AS EVERYBODY KNOWS WE'VE ALL GOT LITHIUM ION- BATTERIES IN OUR POCKETS AND IN OUR HOMES IN OUR CARS AND THEY WORK EXTREMELY WELL. THEY'RE NOT PARTICULARLY WELL SUITED HOWEVER LONG DURATION STORAGE YOU CAN USE THEM BUT THEY'RE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT THE BEST TECHNOLOGY SO WE WANT TO DO IS LOOK AT OTHER CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGIES LIKE ZINC. IRON FLOW BATTERIES WE WANT TO LOOK AT MECHANICAL STORAGE LIKE COMPRESSED AIR AND FLY WHEELS AND WE WANT TO LOOK AT THERMAL TECHNOLOGIES. SECOND BIG PLANK FOR TO SUPPORT THIS LAUNDRY STORAGE IS HELPING COMMUNITIES GET THROUGH GREAT OPTIONS AS WE'VE SEEN THE SUMMER HEAT STORMS THAT HAVE CREATED THE P. S. P. S. ADVANCED. AND ARE IN THE FIRES RESULTED IN OUTAGES MANY OF WHICH HAVE THE SPEAK SEATED FOR HOURS AND THAT'S KIND OF THE INDUSTRY STANDARD FOR WERE LET HIM WORKS THE BEST FOR OUR RANGE SO WE WANT TO LOOK AT EIGHT HOURS AND BEYOND AND IT EIGHT HOURS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE PS PS AND THAT'S WHAT THE MITIGATED BY HAVING THAT STORAGE IN PLACE AND FINALLY. A GREAT SUPPORT AS THEY SB ONE HUNDRED NOTED WE'RE GONNA NEED LOTS OF LOTS OF STORAGE AND INSANITY BE PLACED ON VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THE GRID AND SO THE INVESTMENT WE'RE PROPOSING WOULD HELP US DEVELOP THESE TECHNOLOGIES SO THAT WE CAN PERFORM THAT FUNCTION. RBP ARE BASICALLY SPELLS OUT IN DETAIL AND OBVIOUSLY I'M A POLICE TO TAKE QUESTIONS BUT I'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT ONE SO WE CAN. WE CAN MOVE THROUGH THESE UP QUICKLY TO THE NEXT ONE IS GREEN HYDROGEN HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS WERE SEEKING FOR GREEN HYDROGEN. AS I THINK YOU ALL KNOW AND I KNOW YOU HAD A FUEL CELL VEHICLE AT ONE POINT- THE HYGIENIST ALREADY AVAILABLE IN PLAYING A ROLE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE IT'S ALSO A POTENTIAL PLAYER AND HARD TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS WERE HIGH HEATS. ARE IMPORTANT IN IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PROF. AND THAT'S FINE GRAYSON. IT CAN COPY OR WITH. FOSSIL GAS. AND CAN BE USED AS A- STORE. AND THEN AND THEN BURN OR BRUNCH FEEL SO. WHEN NEEDED. HOWEVER IT'S A NEW TO THE SPACE- HYGIENE AND- WE GOT A LOT TO LEARN. OUR STRATEGY IS A NUMBER STRESS BECAUSE IN ORDER TO USE HIGH JUNIOR TO PRODUCE IT. UNLIKE WHEN WHERE YOU CAN JUST PUT UP A IN A BILL SOMETHING PUT IT AND GET FREE A FREE RESOURCE. FOR SOLAR WERE CAN USE THE IN YOUR- YOU IS FREE- YOU'VE GOT PRODUCE HYDROGEN AND WE- IT THE NO REGRETS STRATEGY BECAUSE WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PRODUCE IT IN A GREEN WAY. OVER 95% OF IT TODAY IS PRODUCED USING FOSSIL FUELS AND THIS FUNDING IS GOING TO HELP. TURN THE TIDE ON THAT IT ALSO HELPED US ATTRACT FEDERAL FUNDS OF THE FEDERAL BIPARTISAN INFRASTRUCTURE LAW AS A LOT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE IN THE THIRD AND IT IS A SIGNIFICANT MATCHING REQUIREMENTS SO WE THINK WE WERE. WELL POISED TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT THIRD IS AWFUL WHEN. WE'RE SEEKING FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR OFFSHORE WIND THIS IS AN ENORMOUS UNTAPPED OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA. WHEN COMPLIMENTS SOLAR NICELY BECAUSE. IT OFTEN BLOWS WHEN THE SUN IS DOWN. IN OUR S. ONE HUNDRED REPORT- I DO A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AND IT LOOKED AT IF WE HAVE TEN GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND THE TWENTY FORTY FIVE WHAT WOULD THAT DO AND THE ANSWERS THAT WOULD SAVE A BILLION DOLLARS AS AGAINST OTHER PORTFOLIOS OF REACH OF RESOURCES. SO THIS IS A THIS HOLDS A LOT OF PROMISE WOULD BE LOOKING AT SPENDING SOME OF THE FUNDS IN EARLY STAGE ENVIRONMENTAL PLANNING AND REVIEWS AND SOME OF IT AND INFRASTRUCTURE OUR PORTS WHERE FATHER MOST SUITABLE TO OFFER WENT FORTH AND FINALLY IN THIS FIRST ELECTRICITY- DECARBONISATION SECTOR IS ENERGY MODELING THIS IS A MODEST REQUEST OF SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS BUT IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL WE IN PUTTING TOGETHER THE SB ONE HUNDRED REPORT WE RELIED VERY HEAVILY ON MODELING TO LOOK AT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS THAT. WE COULD BE FACED WITH IN TWENTY FORTY FIVE AND WE'RE GOING TO INVEST BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THIS IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE MAKE WISE DECISIONS AND IN MODELING IS REALLY A TOOL THAT WILL HELP US. SECOND OF ALL THAT WAS ALL THE LITERACY DECARBONISATION ITEMS SECOND IS BUILDING. THE CAR WE JUST UP ONE ITEM. THEY WANT WE'RE SEEKING HUNDRED TWENTY TWO NO DOLLARS FOR EQUITABLE BUILDING TO. IT AGAIN AS YOU ALL KNOW WE'VE GOT REALLY WELL IN CALIFORNIA WITH OUR NEW BUILDINGS WE'VE GOT SOME OF THE BEST MOST EFFICIENT MOST- BUT LEAST CARBON PRODUCING BUILDINGS IN THE ENTIRE WORLD- IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY DESERVES A LOT OF CREDIT FOR DOING THAT HOWEVER OUR EXISTING BUILDING STOCK HALF OF WHICH WAS BUILT BEFORE THE ENERGY COMMISSION EXISTED IN BEFORE ANY STANDARDS WERE IN PLACE AND ANOTHER BIG CHUNK OF IT. IN THE EARLY DAYS WHEN THE STANDARDS WERE NOT LIKE THEY ARE TODAY- THAT'S A MUCH HARDER SECTOR TO TACKLE FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT REASONS I CAN GO INTO ABOUT I'LL SKIP OVER THAT- SO WE'RE PROPOSING TWO THIRDS OF THAT. FUNDING GO TO DIRECT INSTALLS TO TARGETED TOWARDS DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND LOW AND MODERATE INCOME FOLKS AND THE BALLOTS ONE THIRD OR SO FOR A REBATE PROGRAM AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE. WE EXPECT THAT BOTH OF THESE EFFORTS WILL JUMP START BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION IN CALIFORNIA. FINAL ARE FINE OKAY FIRST IS WHAT WE AFTER THE FOOD PRODUCTION INVESTMENT PROGRAM. AND THE SECONDS MORE BROAD INDUSTRIAL DE CAR SO ON. AN ACTIVE THIS WAS ORIGINALLY FUNDED WITH CLIMATE INVESTMENT FUNDING IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WE RECEIVED A HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS INVESTED ALL THAT. WE HAD TWO HUNDRED SIXTY MILLION DOLLARS OF APPLICATIONS MANY IF NOT MOST OF WHICH- THE DIDN'T GET FUNDED WERE MERITORIOUS PROJECTS BUT WE SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING TO FUND THEM. SOME OF THESE PROJECTS ARE SHOWING 7280% SAVINGS ON. ENERGY CONSUMPTION. AND THE- THE CARB SCORING A VARIOUS PROJECTS PLACED. THE F. TYPE INVESTMENTS ON A- ON A DOLLAR PER. METRIC TON. OF CO TWO EQUIVALENT. VERY HIGH IT'S GOING VERY WELL IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THIRTY THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER METRIC TON. AND WE ESTIMATE THAT THE INVESTMENTS IN THAT PROGRAM WILL SAVE ANOTHER FIFTY ONE MILLION. PER YEAR ONCE EVERYTHING'S FULLY BUILT OUT. SO THIS IS NOT A VERY POPULAR PROGRAM WE JUST WANT TO EXPAND THAT- AND FINALLY I WANT TO TALK ABOUT- INDUSTRIAL THE KERBAL SEEKING. TWO HUNDRED TEN MILLION DOLLARS AND ESSENTIALLY WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE IS. TAKE WHAT WE LEARNED FROM FF WHICH IS VERY LABOR INTENSIVE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH INDUSTRY EARLY ON THERE WAS DEEP SKEPTICISM ABOUT. THE ABILITY FOR THE FUNDS TO DO ANY GOOD IN IN THE INDUSTRY. AND I THINK IF YOU ASK ANYONE ON THE INDUSTRY THAT SAID THIS THIS WORKED OUT REALLY WELL SO WE WANT TO TRY TO REPLICATE THAT. AND THE MORE BROAD INDUSTRIAL SECTOR WHERE WE HAVE FORTY THOUSAND INDUSTRIAL FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA POINT OVER A MILLION PEOPLE. THE DUCHESS SECTORS OF BOTH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR. OVER A THIRD OF THE STATE'S FOSSEL GAS USING ABOUT 20% OF OUR GHG EMISSIONS. SO WHAT WE'D BE LOOKING AT- SOMETHING MEMBERS IN THIS IN THIS. CATEGORY IS. THERE IS LIKE SOME. DEMICHELIS GLASS GHG. WHERE THERE'S REAL AND REAL READ TO THE SORT OF THE BASS WE THINK WE CAN LEARN LOT FROM THE FOOD PRODUCER PROBE. AND WE WILL DO WORKSHOPS WITH ALL PRO TO LEARN FROM FOLKS WHO ARE IN THE INDUSTRY FROM OTHER STAKEHOLDER ABOUT HOW BEST TO SHAPE THEM BUT UP THAT'S PLAN AND I THINK VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THEM WITH FOR YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU- HAVE A REPORT FROM. I'M SORRY I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR REPORT DO WE HAVE- ANYTHING THAT FROM- LMAO. GOOD MORNING MR SHARON NUMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LA- CAN YOU SEE AND HEAR ME. RIGHT. YES OKAY GREAT- SO ABOUT OUR OFFICE RELEASED OUR ANALYSIS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED CLEAN ENERGY PACKAGE A COUPLE WEEKS AGO NOW- THAT ANALYSIS IS AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE IT'S ALSO THERE'S A LINK AVAILABLE ON THE COMMITTEE'S WEBSITE I'M GONNA HAVE. TO GO THROUGH ALL OF OUR COMMENTS BUT I'M NOT TRYING TO HIGHLIGHT THE MAIN PIECES OF OUR ANALYSIS- AND I'M GONNA BREAK IT UP INTO TWO PARTS ONE WILL BE JUST SOME OVER ARCHING COMMENTS ON THE PACKAGE OF THE WHOLE MAN RUN THROUGH SOME OF OUR MAIN COMMENTS ON THAT KIND OF WORK THE ARCHITECTURE OF IT AND THEN ON AN OFFER A FEW KIND OF SPECIFIC COMMENTS ON JUST A FEW OF THE SPECIFIC PROPOSALS SO I'M GONNA JUMP RIGHT IN. FIRST WE THINK THE PACKAGE BETTER TARGETS A REASONABLE STEP BACK. IF THE GOAL OF PROMOTING A LONG TERM CARP. OKAY THE FUNDING WOULD SUPPORT- KEY AREAS WORSE. SECOND PROGRESS HELP LOWER COSTS ACHIEVING TERM GAS REDUCTION GOALS. AND SOME OF THE OTHER PIECES UPON FOR EXAMPLE THE EQUITABLE BUILDING. PROGRAM TARGETS ONE OF THE LARGEST SOURCES OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN THE STATE. THE SECOND- OVERARCHING AS WE THINK ALLOCATING STATE GENERAL FUND RATHER THAN- UTILITY ELECTRIC RATEPAYER FUNDS REALLY HAS MERIT- FOR A LOT OF THESE PROGRAMS. HERE THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY PROGRAMS HISTORICALLY HAVE BEEN PAID FOR THROUGH ELECTRICITY RATEPAYERS THROUGH HIGHER ELECTRICITY RATES. EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THE PRIMARY GOALS OF THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS REALLY ARE GOING TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF SMOKEBENEFITS ACCRUE TO THE BROADER PUBLIC AND SO WE THINK THERE'S A- STRONG RATIONALE FOR USING STATE GENERAL FUND FOR THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS THAT PROVIDE. BROAD SOCIETAL BENEFITS. ALSO ACROSS RIDLEY INTERVIEW PROGRAMS ARE ONE FACTOR ONE OF MANY FACTORS BUT ONE FACTOR THAT CONTRIBUTES TO. CALIFORNIA'S RELATIVELY HIGH- RETAIL ELECTRICITY RATES AND SOME OF THE ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE HIGHER ELECTRICITY RATES ARE ONE THEY CAN DISCOURAGE ELECTRIFICATION SO THAT CAN BE PROBLEMATIC- IN SOME OF THE STATE'S DECARBONIZATION EFFORTS. ALSO ELECTRICITY RATES ARE RELATIVELY REGRESSIVE APPROACH TO RAISING REVENUE AND SO WE DO KIND OF THINK THE ADMINISTRATION'S APPROACH OF USING GENERAL FUND IN THIS AREA HAS A- LOT OF MERIT. THIRD BIG PICTURE COMMENT IS- REALLY WANT TO BUY WITHIN THIS PROPOSAL WITH THE LETTER SO WILL HAVE BALANCE KIND OF LONG TERM DEBT. THE COULD BE ACHIEVED A LOT OF THE PROGRAM AGAINST SOME OTHER NEAR TERM PRIORITIES THAT MIGHT. MY GIVE ME. SO MUCH THE PROPOSED FUNDING IS REALLY FOCUSED ON ACTIVITIES. TO AGAIN TO ME THESE LONG TERM THE CARD. GOALS AND- THE PROGRAM THE G. WERE BETTER. ARE LIKELY TO BE RELATIVELY MODEST OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS AND SO. THE LEGISLATURE AUTOMOTIVE TOPIC BALANCE SOME OF THE LONGER TERM BENEFITS THAT MIGHT BE TREATED WITH OTHER NEAR ME. AND MEDIUM TERM PRIORITIES IT MIGHT HAVE SO FOR EXAMPLE OTHER PROGRAMS AIMED AT MEETING- YOU KNOW TWENTY THIRTY- MEDIUM TERM GREENHOUSE GAS SCHOOL SUCH AS METHANE REDUCTION PROGRAMS OR- OTHER ENERGY RELATED PROGRAMS SUCH AS WITH RESILIENCE AND RELIABILITY. OR OTHER STATEWIDE PRIORITIES THAT MIGHT BE KIND OF NEAR TERM PRIORITIES THE LEGISLATURE. LEGISLATORS. USE THE GENERAL FUND. THE NETWORK AND FIND CAN HOLD CALL- IS AS YOU THERE'S A AND THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED. OTHERS A SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL OF A- FOR SOME SIMILAR. IN THE AND PER BILL- OKAY- CAN- MIGHT PAGE TWENTY H. TWENTY ONE AND TWO OF YOUR AGENDA INCLUDES A TABLE THAT'S- PROVIDE SOME MORE INFORMATION ON THE ON THE WIDE VARIETY OF- FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT. ARE TARGETED SIMILAR THING INCLUDING CLEAN HYDROGEN HUBS CARBON CAPTURE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. INDUSTRIAL MISSION DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS LONGER ASIAN ENERGY STORAGE. BUT IN MANY CASES THE FOR DETAILED FEDERAL GUIDANCE ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING CAN BE USED AND HOW IT WILL BE ALLOCATED ISN'T YET AVAILABLE. BUT THE RESULTS NOT CLEAR HOW THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE STRATEGICALLY TARGETS FUNDING IN A WAY THAT BEST COMPLIMENTS ON THE FEDERAL FUNDING. SO FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE OPPORTUNITIES TO USE STATE FUNDING TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDS IN A WAY. THAT HELPS FURTHER STAPLES- PROGRAMS SUCH AS- FUNDING TO PREVENT. AND ENHANCED THE WORK STATE. UP AT THE IT DOESN'T CANNELLA KATE- FUND FOR THAT STATE NOT MOST PROGRAMS. GOT A QUESTION OR IS THIS ARE THERE TO GET AND BETTER FUNDING THE STATE FUNDING. THE HELPFULNESS OF THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT WANNA IN THE- TO DEVELOP A STRATEGY FOR YOU STATE FUNDS AND THAT THAT BEST COMPLEMENTS FEDERAL. RESTRUCTURE PACKAGE. SO I'M NOT. TWO- AT THE SPECIFIC TIME ON A FEW OF SPECIFIC RECALL ARE THROUGH TO THREE ERRORS QUICKLY OF I CAN ONE OF THE ACT BILL THE CAR PROGRAM- WE RECOMMEND LEGISLATURE DIRECT MINISTRY COOPER ADDITIONAL DETAILS HOW THE FOR BOTH PROGRAMS AFFECT AND KIND OF THE OVERALL STATEWIDE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION STRATEGY- FOR EXAMPLE WHAT'S THE ROLE OF THESE PROGRAMS RELATIVE TO OTHER POTENTIAL POLICY CHANGES SUCH AS CHANGES IN ELECTRICITY RATE STRUCTURES THAT LOWER ELECTRICITY RATES AND COULD ENCOURAGE A BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION. WHAT IMPACT ELECTRIFICATION EFFORTS STOP ON REMAINING NATURAL GAS COSTS FOR CUSTOMERS IN PAIN FOR A KIND OF SOME OF THOSE FIXED INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS AND THEN- ANOTHER FINAL EXAMPLE WHY IS THE INTERNET CONNECTION THE MOST APPROPRIATE AGENCY TO ADMINISTER THIS NEW DIRECT INSTALL PROGRAM THAT'S BEING PROPOSED- AS YOU LIKELY KNOW THAT FOR MANY COMMUNITY SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT ALREADY OPERATES A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT WEATHER EDUCATION PROGRAMS TARGETED AT LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS AND FOR THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE AND WIND UP PROPOSAL IS TO HAVE A NEW PROGRAM AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION RATHER THAN RELYING ON THE EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IF AFTER KIND OF THESE RESPONSES IT'S STILL UNCLEAR WHY THE PROPOSED APPROACH BY THE ADMINISTRATION IS MOST COST EFFECTIVE OR EQUITABLE THE LEGISLATURE COULD SCALE BACK THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING ARE FOCUSED ON WAYS THAT THAT HELPED- DIFFERENT OPTIONS AND. DEVELOP A LONG TERM STRATEGY. THE SECOND IT'S BECAUSE RECALL- IS THE- PUMPS. PROJECT WHICH- I DON'T BELIEVE DIRECTOR TOUCHED ON BUT IS TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILLION OF TO THE FOR A- TO KIND OF THAT- PUMPS FACILITY OR A BILL- IF THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS MAYOR OF THE WEIGHT INTEGRATE RENEWABLE AND UNDER THE ON POWER MAKE CERTAIN AT THE END OF HOW PROVIDED A MORTGAGE HOUSES OF KIND OF THE COST AFFECT OF THE- HER DAUGHTER. SO WE RECKON ALLEGED DIRECT MINISTRY TO PROVIDE- THAT NOW SENT OF COST OF FOR TO OTHER OPTIONS. STATE ON THE PULSE OR THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDES GENERAL FUND FOR THIS PROJECT WE DO RECOMMEND THAT IT ADOPTS TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE REQUIRING. OR TO ESTIMATE THE NET ANNUAL REVENUE GENERATED FROM THE PUMP STORAGE ONCE IT'S OPERATIONAL ENTRANCE FOR THAT AMOUNT THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S THE ARGUE THAT STATE TAX TAXPAYERS ARE PROVIDING THE FUNDING FOR THIS PROJECT TO BE REASONABLE FOR THE STATE TAXPAYERS AND TO KIND OF. RECEIVE THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS FROM THE PROJECT. AND THEN THEY DON'T THINK ANY MINUTE WITH ENDED UP ARE THERE'S A THE PROPOSAL INTERVIEW. EFFORTS AT THE W. R. IT INCLUDES THREE NINE DOLLARS GENERAL FUND PRETTY TO BE OUR SUPPORT ENERGY REAL. ACTIVITIES EVER WRITTEN ENGLISH ROGER THIS. SMALLER PIECE OF THE YOUR AND MINISTRATION OF ADEQUATE DESCRIBE. HOW THE THREE NOT DOLLAR WOULD BE IN THE NEED FOR RESOURCE SO I'M BY WILL MICHAEL THERE OF COURSE NOT TO ANSWER ANY. THE THANK. THANK YOU AND- I NICKEL TO CALL ON- A D. W. ARE IN THE- A. R. B- EARLIER. SINCERITY MADE THAT MISTAKE I THINK WHAT WE'LL DO IS HANDLE ALL THREE OF- THESE PRESENTATIONS- SEQUENTIALLY SO FOR A YOU HAVE QUESTIONS- OUT NOW ON THE C. E. C. PRESENTATION. LET'S DO THAT AND THEN WE'LL DO THE OTHER TWO AS WE HEAR THE- EXCUSE ME- SO. THE REPRESENTATIVE- OKAY HON I'VE BEEN ASKED TO HAVE CARBON D. W. ARE PRESENT NOW SO MY PLAN JUST- WENT OUT OF FISCAL HELLO- HERE- NOW FROM IDW ARE- WE HAVE DEPUTY DIRECTOR CRADDICK GOT WITH US I THINK. DON'T WORRY WILL HOLD. THANK YOU ACCORDING TO GOOD MORNING MEMBERS GOOD TO SEE IT MORNING- AS NOTED IN MINUTES. AT CLEAN ENERGY ATTACK INCLUDES TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION- FOR RESTORATION OF THE PUMP STORAGE CAPABILITY AT THE OROVILLE DAM COMPLEX BUT THIS PROPOSAL WILL DO IS- TURN LAKE OR A BILL INTO A GIANT AND THAT THIRTY- WHICH GENERATE UP TO NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MEGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE. ENERGY AND THIS IS- BUT WHEN ENERGY THAT- K. OF THE POWER CITY THIS OF SAN FRANCISCO JUST TO GIVE A- SENSE OF SCALE- SO WHAT PROPOSAL WOULD DO IT- YOU- THE- SO. ENERGY THAT'S AVAILABLE DURING THE DAY AND ALLOW US TO PUMP WATER BACK INTO LAKE OROVILLE AND THEN RELEASE THAT WATER IN THE LATE EVENING AND- OR LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING HOURS WHEN ENERGY IS MOST NEEDED AND CRITICAL FOR THE ELECTRIC GRID. SO PROVIDES- YOU KNOW A PIECE OF THE OVERALL STORAGE ELEMENT NEEDED FOR THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO CLEAN ENERGY IN ONE OF THE REAL BENEFITS OF THIS PROJECT IS BECAUSE IT WE HAVE THE- TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE THAT ORDER FELL ON THE PROJECT USED. OPERATED AND PUMPED STORAGE MODE- THE INVESTMENT NEEDED TO RESTORE- THIS- OPERATION ON THE ORDER OF ONE FIFTH TO ONE TENTH OF WHAT A NEW DEVELOPMENT WOULD COST AND THEN WE'RE ALSO ABLE TO IMPLEMENT ITS IN ABOUT HALF THE- TIME VERSUS OF THE PROJECT. SO THAT THAT'S AN OVERVIEW OF THE LAKE WATER BILL ALONG AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS AND AT THIS TIME ALL PASS IT OVER TO MICHAEL FITS GIVEN. WITH THE ERA RESOURCES BOARD. IT MORNING THANKS. THANKS FOR THE UP JUST TODAY. THE MORNING CARE IS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE. AGAIN MY NAME IS MIKE THAT'S GIVEN UP WITH CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD- RESEARCH DIVISION. AND HUNDRED FLUOROCARBONS OR AGENCIES ARE THE FASTEST GROWING GREENHOUSE GASES IN CALIFORNIA AND GLOBAL. HSCS ARE SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS WITH HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL THOUSAND TIMES THAT OF CARBON DIOXIDE WHICH HAVEN'T FORTUNATE ADVERSE CLIMATE IMPACT IN THE NEAR TERM AGENCIES IN REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONING EQUIPMENT. AND CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD RECOGNIZED EARLY ON THE NEED TO REGULATE THESE PROBLEMS AND MANY OTHER STATES OF ALL OF OUR LEAD IN ADOPTED SIMILAR RULES TO MITIGATE THESE PROBLEMS. JENNIFER WAS MEET THE TWENTY THIRD OUR GUESTS AND START TO ADDRESS HSCS UNDER CARBON NEUTRALITY. SO THIS PROPOSAL THIS IS ASKING FOR FORTY MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING TO BUILD THE ONE MILLION DOLLARS ALLOCATED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET. THE FIRST OF AUGUST ON COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS COMMONLY USED IN SUPERMARKETS AND GROCERY STORES. ULTRALOW GLOBAL WARMING TECHNOLOGIES EXIST TODAY- BARBARA HIGHER INCREMENTAL COST AND LACK OF FAMILIARITY WITH THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE THE PRIMARY BARRIERS TO THEIR ADOPTION. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR EXISTING STORES BECAUSE IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND CHALLENGING TO TRANSITION TO ULTRA LOW GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL SYSTEM DUE TO INCOMPATIBILITY BETWEEN THE WHOLE OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE ABSENCE OF INCENTIVE FUNDS EXISTING STORES ARE LIKELY TO EITHER CONTINUE TO- USE MAKING SYSTEMS. WHAT DO A REFRIGERANT RETROFIT TO A MID RANGE GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL REFRIGERANT RATHER STALLING. A NEW SYSTEM. SO TWENTY TWENTY ONE- THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES CORP AWARDED FIFTEEN GRANTS TO SUPERMARKETS. STATEMENT STATE OF THE ART I'M A FRIENDLY FOR DURATION TECHNOLOGIES. THAT REDUCE I MEAN IMPACT OF CONVENTIONAL- HFC. REFRIGERANTS BY 99% PROGRAMS TWO PER OVER. AND HAPPY WILL WANT TO STORES LOW IN LOW INCOME. AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. HOWEVER THIS REPRESENTS LESS THAN 1% OF ALL SUPERMARKETS IN CALIFORNIA AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES ARE NEEDED TO HELP TRANSITION THOUSANDS OF EXISTING HFC SYSTEMS IN THE STATE. AND WILL BE CRUCIAL IN HELPING SMALLER STORES AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. UPSETS APARTMENTS WE WOULD CONSIDER INCENTIVES FOR OTHER COMMERCIAL REFRIGERATION CATEGORIES AS WELL AS THEIR CONDITION. SO THE PENDING ON THE SELECTED THEN USES THE FUNDING COULD REPLACE EXISTING HIGH GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL REFRIGERATION SYSTEMS ROUGHLY FIVE HUNDRED TWO THOUSAND STORES FUNDING IS EXPECTED TO HELP THESE TECHNOLOGY TYPES REACH ECONOMIES OF SCALE. WHICH MAY LEAD TO FURTHER MARKET ADOPTION AND THEREFORE GREATER GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. THANK YOU AND SO THAT WRAPS UP THE ADMINISTRATION'S PRESENTATION OF ENERGY PACKAGE AND- WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. THANK YOU- THANK YOU LET ME MAKE SURE THAT- MISTER BROWN DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING- ADDITIONAL- TO ADD ON BEHALF OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE ALL RIGHT THANK YOU AND- OTHERS DOES THAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE ANY COMMENTS THEY LIKE THAT AT THIS TIME. GOOD MORNING DAY MA'AM NOT DEPARTMENT UP AND IT'S NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME BUT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH- SO LET ME OPEN UP THE QUESTION- BY- REFERRING BACK TO OUR INITIAL. UP A PRESENTATION FROM A- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR BALL AND- YOU'RE RIGHT SIR I DO- RETAIN AN INTEREST IN- UGH- HYDROGEN AND PARTICULARLY AND- THE PRODUCTION OF GREEN HYDROGEN- OF THE A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S PROPOSED. HOW MUCH- IT IS RIGHT HERE MARK FOR- ELECTROLYZER SYSTEM. MOVING THAT TECHNOLOGY FORWARD. SHE'S REALLY GOOD QUESTION THE SHORT ANSWER IS THE VAST MAJORITY OF IT THAT'S WHERE WE THINK AGAIN THE MOST CRITICAL PIECES IS BECAUSE YOU'VE GOT TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN IS THAT HAVE TO TYPICALLY STORE IT DELIVER IT AND THEN CONVERTED INTO ENERGY- BACK AND ENERGY AND SO WE THINK THAT FIRST LEG AT THERE'S NOT BEEN A LOT OF ADVANCEMENTS IN THIS AREA AND WE THINK WE CAN ADVANCED THINGS QUITE A BIT. BY BY MAKING INVESTMENTS THERE SO SIGNIFICANT MAJORITY OF IT WOULD ALSO BE LOOKING AT SOME OF THOSE OTHER ASPECTS SOME OF THE DISTRIBUTION SOME OF THE STORAGE- WELL AS THEIR COMPLEMENTARY AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST SAY WE WANT TO PUT REAL SPECIFICS TOGETHER AND BUILD A SOLICITATION THAT WE WOULD PUT OUT AFTER HEARING FROM STAKEHOLDERS AND HEARING FROM THE BEST MINDS ON HOW WE MIGHT DO THIS THE BEST BUT THE FOCUS WOULD CLEARLY BE AN ELECTROLYSIS SO- I'VE I'VE READ JUST ENOUGH ON ON THIS TOPIC TO MAKE MYSELF. PROBABLY. REALLY DANGEROUS- BUT IT IT DOES TO ME THAT THERE'S A LOT OF INVESTMENT AND ELECTROLYZER. TECHNOLOGY GOING ON AROUND THE WORLD MOST RECENTLY I WAS READING ABOUT- PROJECTED INVESTMENT. TO IN AUSTRALIA- AND THE INVESTMENT THEIR MUCH OF WHICH WAS COMING FROM THE- PRIVATE SECTOR WAS IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS- CAN YOU COMMENT ON SORT OF WHERE WE ARE. TECHNOLOGICALLY AS A STATE THE COUNTRY VERSUS THE REST OF THE WORLD AND TO- WHITE MIGHT BE IMPORTANT FOR US TO- TAKE A LEADERSHIP. ROLE IN MOVING THE TECHNOLOGY FORWARD. CERTAINLY I DON'T KNOW HOW WE STARE RELATIVE TO OTHERS AROUND THE WORLD IN TERMS OF HOW TO DEVELOP WE ARE BUT THAT THE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF IS ON REMARKABLE USING USING ELECTRICITY TO SPLIT HYDROGEN OUT OF EITHER. METHANE CH FOR WATER H. TWO O. CAN BE DONE THE CHALLENGES HOW DO YOU DO IT COST EFFECTIVELY HOW DO YOU DO IT USING CHEAPER RENEWABLE ENERGY HOW DO U. FAKE HOW DO YOU CITED. IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE PRODUCING AT THEN AND NOT HAVING TO INCUR LARGE COSTS TO MOVE IT TO FAR FLUNG PLACES WHAT'S APPEALING ABOUT IT IS IF YOU USE SOLAR IN PARTICULAR YOU COULD SET UP- PROPERLY SITED SOLAR FARM. PRODUCE ELECTRICITY NECESSARY TO SPLIT THE WATER AND- AND THEN YOU HAVE RIGHT WHERE YOU NEED IT THAT THE HIGHER. I THINK THERE'S THE THING WE'RE LOOKING AT IS REALLY. RIGHT TO BRING COSTS DOWN. AND TO DO THAT THAT OF COURSE INVOLVES TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS BUT IT ALSO INVOLVES JUST BLOCKING TACKLING OPERATIONS WE'VE SEEN THAT IN THE SOLAR INDUSTRY WHERE. THE TECHNOLOGY WAS ONE PIECE OF WHAT DROVE THE COSTS DOWN BUT A LOT OF IT HAD TO DO IT HOW DO YOU PUT RACKING ON THAT'S THE LEAST EXPENSIVE HOW DO YOU GET- LABOR TO BOB. WORK NICELY WITH THE OTHER PARTS OF THE BUILDING INDUSTRY IS AS OF STRUCTURE IS BEING BUILT. TO WHERE WE WANT TO EXPLORE ALL THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS. THANK YOU- A WITH RESPECT TO THE- A REQUEST FOR- RESOURCES FOR- OFFSHORE WIND- THE AMOUNT IS FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS AND- I THINK THE- UGH UGH. A DATE THAT I SAW IN THE US STAFF REPORT WAS- JUNE OF- TWENTY TWENTY THREE AT WHICH UP A POINT TO THESE OF FUNDS WOULD BE UP OF FULLY SPENT WHERE ARE WE. TIMELINE WISE WITH RESPECT TO DEVELOPMENT OF- OFFSHORE WIND AND IF WE SPEND THIS MONEY- HOW SOON DO YOU THINK WE COULD ACTUALLY BEGIN DEPLOYING- VISIBILITIES- IN OUR OFFSHORE AREAS IN THE STATE AND R. THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN DEPLOYED MANY PARTS OF THE WORLD. AND ON THE EAST COAST I'M NOT SURE WHERE ELSE IN THE UNITED STATES- IT STRIKES ME THAT WORLD A LITTLE BIT BEHIND- US IN THIS DEPLOYMENT SO- IF YOU CAN. COMMENT ON THAT I'D APPRECIATE IT AND IF WE WANT TO ACCELERATE THAT PROCESS WHAT WOULD WE NEED TO DO. QUESTIONS THE ENERGY VISIONS AND WORKING ON OFFSHORE WIND NOW FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND THIS ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC IS THIS REALLY SUPPORT OF IN FACT. THE VICE ADMINISTRATION ANNOUNCED RECENTLY A NATIONWIDE GOAL THIRTY GIGAWATTS BY TWENTY THIRTY AND- COULD WE PULL IT OFF BY TWENTY THIRTY I THINK IT'S POSSIBLE- BUT- WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT BOWMAN. AND THERE THE CHIEF AGENCY THAT'S THAT'S INVOLVED AND WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE- BEEN ABLE TO OVERCOME A LOT OF THE LOT OF THE BARRIERS WITH LOTS OF ISSUES WHEN YOU WANT TO BUILD OFF OFF THE COAST. WE'RE TALKING QUITE FAR OFF THE COAST TO IN THE TWO PRINCIPAL AREAS ARE IN THE CENTRAL COAST AND IN THE NORTH COAST THE CENTRAL COAST HAS EXCELLENT ON SHORE. CAPABILITIES TO ACCEPT POWER AND WE'LL AROUND THE STATE NORTH COAST NOT AS NOT AS GOOD BUT IT'S ABOUT A RESOURCE. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS WE'RE LOOKING AT QUITE A DISTANCE OFF SHORE TWENTY MILES PLUS AND- IT'S VERY DEEP WATER SO UNLIKE A LOT OF THE PLACES THAT HAVE BUILT A LOT OF WIND TO DATE. WE WE'RE GONNA NEED TO TETHER IT TO THE TO THE BOTTOM OF THE OCEAN QUITE ADEPT IT WOULDN'T BE A- YOU KNOW A LARGE SUPERSTRUCTURE MOUNTED DIRECTLY TO THE BOTTOM OF A SEXUALLY EXPLODING. AND IT'S DONE BEING DONE AROUND THE WORLD IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UNPRECEDENTED BUT IT'S ALSO NOT COMMON SO WE'VE GOT A LOT TO LEARN WHAT WE'RE HOPING TO DO WITH THIS WITH THIS FUNDING IS START TO PAVE THE WAY. THEY HAVE YOUR QUESTION DIRECTLY WORKING WAS INTRODUCED TO SPEED THINGS UP. I THINK A LOT OF THE TIMING HAS TO DO WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN ITS PROCESS OF- THE DEADLINE LEASE AREAS HOLDING LEASE SALES AND THAT SORT OF THING YOU'VE PROBABLY READ EITHER OCCURRING ON THE- EAST COAST. AND. WE'RE EAGER TO SEE THE MOVE. AS WELL. THANK YOU AND HAVE MY FIVE CALL- IS- ON THE TOPIC OF BUILDING GOT DECARBONISATION- THE L. A. OAK- OBSERVES THAT- MORE DETAILS- IS NECESSARY ASSUME. THAT WILL BE WEEKS BUT- THE L. A. O. ALSO- ASKS THE QUESTIONS A LITTLE BIT IN YOUR FACE SO I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT BUT- IT'S WHY THE ENERGY COMMISSION- SENSORS OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT. I HISTORICALLY HAVE DONE PROJECTS LIKE THIS WIOQ- SHIFT SOME OF THESE RESPONSIBILITIES. TO THE ENERGY COMMISSION. PERFECTLY LEGIT QUESTION WE- WE TALKED TO THE OTHER. POSSIBLE ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA CHIEF AMONG THEM ONE ONE THAT ROSS SPELLED OUT WHICH IS SIXTY THE COMMUNITY. SERVICES AND DEVELOPMENT- DEPARTMENT AND- ESSENTIALLY WE ALL AGREED WE CAME TO AN AGREEMENT INTERNALLY THAT ENERGY COMMISSION WAS THE MOST SENSIBLE PLACE TO DO THIS WE MANAGED OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF OUR MONEY. BACK IN YOUR DAYS AND THERE ARE SOME SMALL ONES FUNDS COMING CALIFORNIA'S WAY FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL FUNDING FROM THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL IN THAT AREA. AND WE'VE GOT LOTS OF EXPERIENCE WITH ENERGY ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROBABLY NOBODY KNOWS MORE ABOUT IT IN THE STATE THAN THAN THAT THAN THAN THE ENERGY COMMISSION. WE ALSO- WE ALSO MOVEMENT A LOT OF MONEY AND- WEEK YOU LEARN THINGS WHEN YOU DO THAT ABOUT HOW TO AVOID MISTAKES AND- THAT'S IT THANKS I THINK WE'RE WELL EQUIPPED TO DO IT. AND FINALLY I'D SAY IT'S GOING TO BE. SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED THE CST PROGRAMS TEND TO BE VERY TARGETED TOWARDS WEATHERIZATION TYPE THINGS LIKE INSULATION BETTER WINDOWS- OTHER BETTER ENVELOPE TYPE MEASURES WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT SOME COMPLICATED ONES LIKE ELECTRIC. APPLIANCES ELECTRIC HOT WATER HEATERS ELECTRIC- SPACE HEATERS AND COOLERS AND- THE TECHNOLOGY BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME BUT DEPENDING ON YOUR FACILITY YOU MIGHT NEED A PANEL UPGRADE BECAUSE YOU'RE DRUNK MORE ELECTRICITY THAN YOUR HOME OR BUSINESS WAS DESIGNED TO. THERE'S A LOT OF COMPLICATING FACTORS AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK WE'D WOULD BE WELL SUITED AS A AS THE STATE ENTITY THAT TO MANAGE THIS BY THE WAY WE'RE GONNA WILL PLANNING TO HIRE OUT. TO HAVE BEEN ADMINISTRATOR DO THE ACTUAL INTERFACE WITH THE WITH THE ULTIMATE FOLKS WOULD GET THE MONEY BUT. WE WOULD WE WOULD MANAGE THE ENTERPRISE. SO ON THE QUESTION A- SO ARE THIS IS. A STAFF REAL- WITH OTHER- AGENCIES HELLO FOLKS KNOW TO- I COME TO YOU IF THEY'RE INTERESTED IN THESE PROJECTS. WE'RE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH CST CST DOES HAVE A LOT OF ACTUAL RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY BUILT THEIR AIR DISTRICTS IN THE STATE THAT HAVE DONE SO AS WELL BUT I DON'T THINK- THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF MONEY AND WE WILL DO A LOT OF WORKSHOPS AND I AND I DON'T THINK. GETTING THE WORD OUT TO BE OUR BIGGEST CHALLENGE AND OF FINALLY- IF THE- THIS IS APPROVED AND- IN THE IN THE BUDGET WHEN WOULD WE EXPECT UP ACTUAL PROJECTS ONE WITH A CONSUMER ACTUALLY BE ABLE TO- REACH OUT AND- BEGIN A PROJECT AT TO. A HIS OR HER WHOLE. REALLY MADE A REALLY- PORTANTINO INTO SOME OF THE THINGS IN THE PACKAGE THAT WAS PRESENTED TO YOU THIS MORNING OUR LONGER TERM MODERATION STORAGES IS SOMETHING WE'RE GONNA BUILD AND HAVE UP AND RUNNING NEXT YEAR- BUT BUT THIS IS ONE OF THOSE. I'D BE HESITANT TO GIVE YOU A PRECISE TIME FRAME BUT IF APPROVED IN JUNE WE WERE IMMEDIATELY GO OUT DO WORKSHOPS AND IT YOU KNOW IT DEPENDS SOMETIMES YOU LEARN IN A WORKSHOP THAT SOMETHING YOU HAD IN MIND REALLY DOESN'T WORK AS WELL AS YOU THOUGHT AND YOU NEED TO HAVE A LITTLE BIT AND RETOOL SO- BUT ASSUMING THINGS WENT WELL WE COULD HAVE- BOB GUIDELINES IN PLACE. CERTAINLY WITHIN A YEAR AND THEN BE ABLE TO START PUTTIN SOLICITATIONS ON THE STREET NOT NOT LONG THEREAFTER SIDE I'D BE THINKING OF SUMMER SUMMER NEXT YEAR WOULD BE PRETTY AMBITIOUS BUT THAT WOULD BE A REASONABLE TARGET. ALL RIGHT- THANK YOU- LET'S PAUSE- ESTABLISH A QUORUM AND THEN WILL PROCEED WITH QUESTIONING CUT. FROM OTHER MEMBERS. BLOOM HERE SENATE HERE FRIEDMAN HERE MULLIN PATTERSON RIVAS SMITH HERE TAKING THEIR AND I'D LIKE TO WELCOME CHAIR TEND TO OUR HEARING AND TO SEE IF HE HAS ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- JUST QUICK QUESTIONS TO OUR ACCOUNT EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- ARMY WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S- AMBITIOUS PACKAGE ON BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IT SEEMS THAT ONE. AREA REALLY WASN'T TOUCHED ON WHICH IS. MOVING TOWARD- COMPLETELY EXTRICATION FOR BUILDINGS I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR COMMENTS AS TO. HEAR WHAT ROLE THEY ENERGY COMMISSION WANTS TO PLAY ON THAT ISSUE I KNOW THE CPUC BROTHERS A BIGGER ROLE TO PLAY BUT JUST CURIOUS WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE. CERTAINLY WE ADOPTED STANDARDS- THAT STANDARDS WANT TO AFFECT LAST YEAR BUILDING STANDARDS THAT WE ADOPT ON A ON A ROUGHLY THREE YEAR CYCLE AND- WE WERE WE FOR THE FIRST TIME REQUIRED THAT ALL NEW COMMERCIAL STRUCTURE- STRUCTURES WITH WITHIN A CERTAIN RANGE. B. THEY HAVE SOARED ON THEM WHICH MATCHED OUR- EARLIER REQUIREMENT THAT THAT TAKE PLACE ON RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS SO THAT WAS ONE BIG YOU KNOW DOWN PAYMENT ON ELECTRIFICATION AND DECARBONISATION OF BUILDINGS. WE ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE BUILDINGS BE BE READY TO BE ELECTRIFIED SUB SO THERE'S NOT AN APP THERE'S NOT A MANDATE THAT ALL NEW BUILDINGS GOING FORWARD MUST BE. ZERO EMISSION OR MUST BE ENTIRELY ELECTRIC BUT WE'RE WE'RE PAVING THE WAY AND A LOT OF- PROGRESSIVE BUILDERS ARE GOING TO FLORIDA MAKING BUILDINGS ALL AFTER PARTICULARLY IN THE IN THE PRESIDENTIAL SPACE SO WE'RE EAGER TO. SEE THAT HAPPEN AND THERE WERE MANY WHO FELT LIKE WE SHOULD HAVE PUSHED IN OUR LAST BUILDING CODE CYCLE TO MANDATE BOB WELL EDUCATION AND WE- MY BOSSES THE COMMISSIONS THAT CHOSE NOT TO DO THAT AT THIS TIME BUT- I THINK WE'RE REALLY WELL ON THE WAY. TO THAT. TO THAT OUTCOME. THANK THE WINDS WIND THE NEXT TIME YOUR RIVAS THOSE I GUESS. I FORGET THE LOS LIKE PAYING THE GOLDEN. ITS MARKETS CAN'T GO BRIDGE YOU KNOW YOU'VE YOU'RE DONE. BY WHEN YOU'RE DONE AND YOU TELL FOR MINUTES AND YOU START SO WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING HEAVILY ALREADY ON THE NEXT CYCLE THE LAST CYCLE WE REFER TO AS OUR TWENTY NINETEEN STANDARDS. AND WE'RE LOOKING WE'RE CALLING THESE THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO STANDARDS SO WE'RE LOOKING AT ADOPTING IN IN CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TO THE NEXT THE NEXT ROUND OF STANDARDS THAT THEY GET THEY GET EVER TIGHTER- IN TERMS OF REDUCING ENERGY CONSUMPTION GREAT AND I MAY NEVER REALLY URGE ALL THE ALL THE COMMISSIONS TO REALLY TAKE A HARD LOOK AT. DOING A MANDATE IT DOESN'T REALLY SEEM TO MAKE SENSE AS WERE PUTTING UP- NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS WHETHER WE'RE- BUT DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO BUILD NATURAL GAS PIPELINES INTO THOSE- NEW COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS DOESN'T REALLY MAKE SENSE TO. LOOK AT- NEW BUILDINGS AND TRY TO HAVE THEM FIGURE OUT WHAT THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALL ELECTRIC OR NOT I THINK THAT. THE STATE NEEDS TO TAKE A MUCH STRONGER ROLE IN PROVIDING THAT DIRECTION TOWARD A LECTURE FOR CATION- BECAUSE I THINK IF THEY DON'T DO YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A HODGE PODGE OF STANDARDS AND THEN WHAT YOU'RE GONNA END UP DOING IS- IT'LL BE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO TRANSITION IF YOU ACTUALLY PUT UP NEW BUILDINGS. WITH NATURAL GAS THAT GOES INTO RUSSIA BROTHER WE HAVE ALL THE TECHNOLOGY WE NEED. IT'S VERY SIMPLE TO MOVE FORWARD- WE COULD EVEN DO OF MORE WATER RECAPTURING IS SO JUST SEEMS THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO- SET A CLEAR DIRECTION ABOUT WHERE WE'D LIKE TO GO RATHER THAN JUST LEAVING IT UP TO INDIVIDUAL. BUILDING DEVELOPERS AND BUILDING OWNERS AS TO AS TO WHERE THEY SHOULD GO BECAUSE- WE'RE CLEARLY NOT GOING TO MAKE OUR YOU KNOW I'M OUR GOALS IF WE CONTINUE TO- SEND MIXED SIGNALS READ REGARDING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS- REGARDING ALL OF PARIS CLIMATE GOALS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT- AND SO. ON WHEN DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE SO WITH THAT THE TWENTY. TO ADOPTION WOULD YOU THINK THOSE WILL BE ADOPTED OR CONSIDERED. BOB WHAT THE HOPE IS THAT THEY THAT THEY GET ADOPTED AND INTEL ENCOUNTER YOUR TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN THERE'S A LAG BUT AS TO WHEN THEY BECOME EFFECTIVE WHICH TYPICALLY ABOUT A YEAR A YEAR AFTER THAT TO GIVE THE INDUSTRY AN OPPORTUNTY TO ADJUST. AND WHAT WE WHAT WE DO IN OUR STANDARDS AS WE PROVIDE MULTIPLE PATHWAYS TO COMPLIANCE IN THE BUILDING INDUSTRY'S. BETTER ENGAGED IN AND DEVELOPING LIKE THIS BECAUSE THERE'S A PRESCRIPTIVE PATH WE BASICALLY PROVIDE A LISTING IF YOU CHECK ALL THESE BOXES. YOU SATISFY THE STANDARDS MORE. MORE PLAYERS LIKE TO USE- A DIFFERENT APPROACH WHERE YOU CAN TRADE AND OR WHAT BUILDING MATERIALS RE AVAILABLE OR WHAT STYLE BUILDING YOU DO. YOU MIGHT FIND AS A BUILDER ONE. APPROACH TO MEETING THE STANDARDS OF MORE APPEALING THAN ANOTHER AND YOU'RE FREE TO DO THAT AS FAR AS RATCHETING DOWN TO MANDATING. ALL LIKE CREEK THAT'S A THAT'S I MEAN IN TERMS OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION DURING THAT THAT REALLY REMAINS TO BE SEEN AND CERTAINLY THE LEGISLATURE- CAN HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WELL. NO PRE APPRECIATE THAT MCGETTIGAN YEAH I THINK- ENERGY COMMISSION TOOK A HUGE LEADERSHIP ROLE AND- ASKING THAT ALL NEW RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS YOU JUST HIS HIDE YOU KNOW. CITED THIS AROUND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS HAVEN'T. ROOFTOP SOLAR SO THAT WASN'T THERE THERE ARE DIFFERENT PASS ON THAT SO I DON'T THINK THERE SHOULD REALLY BE. A DIFFERENT PATH. FOR CATIA IS VERY CLEAR- THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR THIS IS THE DIRECTION. THAT WE NEED TO GO ESPECIALLY AS WE ALECTRA FIRE OUR ENTIRE- GREETED IN OUR ENTIRE SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA. SO THAT IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE TO HAVE A GROUP FULL OF CLEAN ENERGY IN FOR A BUILDING NOT TO BE USING THAT CLEAN ELECTRIC GRID SO- I GET AGAIN- YOU KNOW I'LL BE TALKING DIRECTLY TO THE COMMISSIONERS. WELL AND REALLY URGING THEM TO REBOUND CONSIDER THIS AS A AS A NEW FORD AND- DELIBERATE THAT TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUILDING BECAUSE WE REALLY APPRECIATE. YOUR YOUR THOUGHTS THANK YOU. CLICK HERE FOR A MAJOR WANT RESPONSE TO THE FUNDING WERE SEEKING FOR BUILDING- BUILDING THE CARPET IS. WILL WILL WILL. WE THINK WORK HAND IN GLOVE WITH WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED- ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGIES TO POWER HOMES AND BUSINESSES. IT'S UNREMARKABLE. IT'S ALSO RELATIVELY UNCOMMON IN CALIFORNIA IT'S QUITE POPULAR IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE. OR THE PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD. BUT BY. BY PRIMING THE PUMP AND PUTTING SOME FUNDS OUT THERE INTO OUR OUR PARTICULAR LOW INCOME AREAS. IT'LL GIVE THE WHOLE BUILDING INDUSTRY AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET A LOT MORE FAMILIAR WITH WITH HEAT PUMPS AND I'VE GOT A GUN TO MAKE MY HOUSE. ONE ONE STEP TRIED NEARLY ALL LIKE TRICKS I LEARNED THERE'S A THERE'S SOME NEW THINGS IN THE CONTRACTORS. HAVE YOU KNOW SOME OF OUR PART NOW MORE OR LESS ABOUT. ABOUT THESE THINGS I THINK GETTING GETTING THOSE FUNDS OUT THERE AND GETTING THESE THINGS. MORE NORMAL IN CALIFORNIA. WILL HELP FACILITATE WE ARE DESCRIBING. YEAH CAN COULDN'T COME AGREE MORE SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR OF YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THAT. THANK YOU. AB DE AS I CALL ON MISTER SMITH LET ME- JUST SAY IT'S NOT EVERYONE WHO WOULD CHOOSE TO ATTEND A BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE THREE HEARING. ON THEIR BIRTHDAY SO. HOW WE WANT TO WISH MEDIA HAPPY BIRTHDAY THANK YOU OF MISTER BLOOM. QUESTION IS THE LAST REPORT I'VE BEEN ABLE TO FIND IN TWO THOUSAND- NINETEEN. CALIFORNIA'S NET ELECTRICITY IMPORTS WE'RE A LITTLE OVER SEVENTY MILLION MEGAWATT HOURS. WHICH WAS 25% OF THE STATE'S SUPPLY. WHAT IS IT NOW OR DO WE HAVE ANY UPDATED ONE. RESCUE ME UP ASSEMBLY MEMBER I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I DON'T THINK IT'S THAT HIGH I THINK IT'S- WILL LOWER THE 25% BUT WE CAN GET YOU THOSE PRECISE NUMBERS OKAY IT WAS THAT HIGH IN TWENTY NINETEEN THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIND OUT IF WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO BRING THAT DOWN. WORKS WITH THE PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THEN- I HAVE OTHER OMV IT'LL COME BACK ON HERE. NUMBER NUMBER THERE ARE COLLEAGUES FROM THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION WHO- MAYBE JUMP AND TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION ABOUT IMPORTS. WHY DON'T IS THAT ALRIGHT YEAH YEAH I WAS OPENING MY WE HAVE THEM ANSWER THAT. I SERVICES HI THERE- IT'S CALL OUT WITH THAT ENERGY DIVISION YOU SEE I ACTUALLY ALSO DO NOT HAVE THOSE NUMBERS AT MY FINGERTIPS AND WHATNOT- INCLUDE THE- PUBLIC UTILITIES- WHAT I DID SO I THINK WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH BACK. COULD YOU SEE TO GET CURRENT NUMBERS FOR THAT. IN FUNDING FOR THE GET OROVILLE DAM STILL RECYCLE THE WATER BACK UP TO THE- POWER PLANT I CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WATER. IN ORVILLE LAKE RIGHT NOW TO EVEN GET INDIA ELECTORS ELECTRICITY THROUGH THE HYDROELECTRIC PLANT. I KNOW THE FUNDING- GOING TO THE FUTURE FOR IT AND WE MIGHT HAVE WATER TO FUTURE WHAT WE'RE PRODUCING ZERO ELECTRICITY AT OUT OF OR BILL. A HYDROELECTRIC DAM CURRENTLY. YEAH GOOD MORNING MEMBER THIS IS THAT. TED CRADDOCK. RIGHT NOW THEY WERE A BILL WE THE WATER LEVEL IS HIGH ENOUGH WHERE WE PRESUME THAT POWER OPERATIONS OUT OF THE LAKE- THAT HAPPENED. IN THE DECEMBER TIME FRAME SO WE DID HAVE A BRIEF PERIOD BECAUSE OF THE EXTREME DROUGHT. I WOULDN'T LAKE FELL BELOW- THE POWER PLAN ELEVATION BUT WE'RE BACK IN OPPOSITION NOW. IN I KNOW WE ALL WANT TO GO ELECTRICITY BUT CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA STILL. CONSUMING ONE POINT MILLION BARRELS OF CRUDE OIL EVERY DAY. WE'RE IMPORTING ONE POINT FOUR MILLION BARRELS A DAY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES THEN I'LL GO AHEAD AND RUSSIA. THE RAINFOREST. IS BEING DESTROYED IN THIS WORLD WE'RE TRYING TO. SAVE THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WHY ARE WE NOT APPROVING PERMITS TO DRILL OIL IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DON'T HAVE TO IMPORTED OIL. THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. THEIR SCIENTIFIC STUDY. THAT IS THE THOSE OF SUPERTANKERS IS THE HIGHEST NUMBER ONE POLLUTED IN THE LA BASIN. SO I DON'T KNOW WHERE IT'S GONNA GO BUT I DO BELIEVE WE CAN'T JUST TURN THE SWITCH ON TO ELECTRICITY WE STILL NEED TO PRODUCE OIL. AND SLOWLY GO TO ELECTRICITY YOU'RE CUTTING OUT AN INDUSTRY WE'RE STILL IMPORTING THAT OIL STILL AFFECTING THE AIR STILL AFFECTING THE RESIDENTS AND I THINK WE NEED TO DRILL OIL IN CALIFORNIA EXPRESSLY RIGHT NOW IN THE TIME OF THE WORLD. WE NEED TO BE TRY TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT HERE WITHOUT IMPORTING. FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT HAVE THE LABOR STANDARDS DO NOT HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS WE MIGHT BE FIXING IT IN CALIFORNIA. BUT THE AIR FROM THE REST OF THE WORLD STILL CYCLES OF THE EARTH RIGHT THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MISTER BENNETT. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH A CHERRY BLOOM- MY FIRST QUESTION IT JUST DEALS WITH OUR PROCEDURES AND STUFF BUT- DIRECTOR BOTTOM HAS BEEN VERY EASY FOR ME TO HEAR- BUT SOME OF THE OTHER PRESS PRESENTERS IT REALLY DIFFICULT- AND I WOULD HOPE I'VE BEEN AT SOME OTHER COMMITTEE HEARINGS WHERE THEY'VE NOW BEGUN. BACK TO IN PERSON PRESENTATIONS AND SO I JUST RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT IF WE CAN I WOULD SURE APPRECIATE. HAVING THEM HERE AND NOT MISS. THE KEY WORDS IN AN AND ALL OF THAT BUT THIS TECHNOLOGY IS- IS JUST NOT GOOD ENOUGH FOR US TO BE ABLE TO RIGHT I THINK HERE ARE SOME OF THE IMPORTANT THINGS ARE PRESENT RIGHT- THANK YOU I THANK YOU AND IF YOU ARE HAVING. TROUBLE HEARING- SOMETIMES WE CAN MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ACCOUNT THAT ARE HELPFUL I KNOW THE FIRST DOES BECAUSE A LITTLE BIT MUFFLED TO. GREAT THANK YOU- AT SIX THE SECONDLY- FOR DIRECTOR BOTTOM- AND THAT- I REALLY APPLAUD THE- ADMINISTRATION'S EFFORTS TO- TRY TO MOVE US TOWARDS GREEN HYDROGEN THE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- THAT A STATE IS FUNDED THERE- I THINK IT'S ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL. FOR US TO GET A NEW A NEW ENERGY SOURCE OF FOR GOING TO DO IT ON A ON A MASSIVE SCALE FOR US TO MOVE AS QUICKLY TO THE GREEN. HYDROGEN AS POSSIBLE- SO THAT- WE GET THOSE BENEFITS AND WE DON'T SPEND A LOT OF TIME AND ENERGY ON SOMETHING INTERMITTENT THAT- CHEWS UP RESOURCES- I WOULD LIKE TO. POINT OUT THAT THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT AS YOU ARE TRYING TO WORK ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE GERMAN BREWMASTER. I THINK THE MOST APPROPRIATE QUESTION WHAT PERCENTAGE IS GOING TO BE ON ELECTROLYSIS- AND- TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WERE FOCUSED ON THAT. AND YOU POINTED OUT THAT TRYING TO GET IT WHERE. IT COULD BE PRODUCED AT. LIKE AT A SOLAR FARM- SO IT WOULD BE RIGHT THERE IN TERMS OF LOCATION BUT HYDROGEN DOES HAVE THE- POTENTIAL TO BE MOVED AROUND BY HYDROGEN TRUCKS- AND HYDROGEN TRUCKS. HAULING HYDROGEN TO OTHER PLACES COULD BE A VERY LOW CARBON ORDERS HAVE APPROACH ALL THE WAY AROUND- ENJOY JUST ASK US TO IT WHILE YOU ARE LOOKING AT. THE SYNERGIES. OF OKAY I REGION AT THE SOLE OUR FARM SIDE OF IT- OTHER OP. FOR THE PURGE PRODUCTION OF ELECT- FOR THE GREEN HYDROGEN- SEEM TO ME TO BE APPROPRIATE ALSO- MY- NEXT COMMENT- IS- THE LONG MIGHT NEXT QUESTION IS FOR THE LONG TERM STORAGE- OPTION. I NOTED IN THE PRESENTATION BY THE L. A. O. HYDROGEN IS NOT LISTED AND COULD YOU ANSWER FOR ME- DIRECTOR BOND. IS HYDROGEN. A CONCERT GOER GOING TO BE CONSIDERED ONE OF THOSE NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE WOULD BE CONSTRUED LOOKING OUT FOR LONG TERM STORAGE. ABSOLUTELY ABSOLUTELY AND WE'RE WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT IT AS A PIECE OF THE HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S DEDICATED CHIEFLY TO ISSUE COULD YOU NOTED- ARE PROPOSALS TO CHEAPLY DEDICATE THAT TOWARD ELECTROLYSIS BUT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT OTHER PARTS OF THE CHAIN INCLUDING INCLUDING STORAGE- I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY REFERRING MORE TO THE GRID SCALE STORAGE- VERSUS TANKS AND THAT SORT OF THING FOR MORE READY USE BUT BUT WE THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT ALL THOSE PIECES IN THE INDUSTRY SPOKE ABOUT HYDROGEN SO THE NUMBER THAT YOU'VE GIVEN THE FLAG A WHOLE BUNCH OF THE ISSUES THAT WE JUST NEED TO GET. A LOT MORE KNOWLEDGEABLE ABOUT YOU CAN DEFINITELY TRY CUT AGAIN BUT WHEN YOU COMPRESS IT YOU YOU BURN A LOT OF ENERGY COMPRESSING IF YOU LOOK A FIGHT YOU BRING EVEN MORE ENERGY SO THERE'S COSTS AND BENEFITS OF THE ALL THE MULTIPLE APPROACHES AND WE NEED TO LEARN A LOT MORE ABOUT THEIR PHYSICALLY THE SIX COULD BE LOCATED IN WHAT THE TRADE OFFS ARE. WELL I AT. I APPRECIATE THAT IT AYE AYE SIR SHARE. CHAIR BLOOM- INTO IN THE HYDE. AND THE COMMENTS AND AN INTERESTED- THAT HE'S DEMONSTRATED AND THEN CERTAINLY SUPPORT THAT- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT. IF I COULD GO TO THE PORCH- AND- EIGHT A QUESTION THAT I HAVE- WITH THE IF WINCH. THE OFFSHORE WIND. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE ASSEMBLY OF THESE BIG WIND TURBINES THE CLOSER WE DO IT TO THE SHIP THAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO TAKE THEM OUT. BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE- IS THERE ANY ATTENTION YET BEING PAID TO. HOW WE MIGHT LOCATE THE ASSEMBLY OF THESE BIG WIND TURBINES- THAT NEAR THE PORCH- SO THAT- WE- DON'T HAVE THE AWKWARDNESS OF TRYING TO TRANSPORT TO A BIG WIND TURBINES- FROM THE ASSEMBLY POINT- TO THOSE PORTS. ANY ANY- IT EXPLORATION OF THAT YET. ABSOLUTELY THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE RIGHT ON THAT THESE ARE LARGE THE YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT HUNDREDS OF THE LONG TURBINES TODAY AND THEY'RE GETTING LONGER EVERY DAY IN THE MEGAWATTS PER. TURBINE IS GOING UP EVERY DAY AND SO WE'RE IN THE PERFECT SPOT TO IT TO ADAPT TO THAT BUT BUT MOVING THOSE THINGS EVEN FROM SOME OF THE PARTY CALIFORNIA TO THE COAST IS NO TRIVIAL MATTER SO. ABSOLUTELY LOOKING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF ONSITE PRODUCTION TO LOAD RIGHT ONTO A SHIP TO TAKE THEM OUT TO SEA IS THIS SOMETHING WE WANT TO LOOK AT CLOSELY. GREAT THANK YOU AND MY QUESTION IS- PROBABLY FOR D. W. R. HERE REGARDING THE PUMP STORAGE AT- ORVILLE- STE. I'M CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF- OF ALL OF THE- CARBON NEUTRAL APPROACHES THAT WE CAN WE CAN COME UP WITH- MY QUESTION FOR- D. W. OURS. DO YOU HAVE DATA ON THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF PUMPED STORAGE. VERSUS YOU TALKED ABOUT USING THE EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY FOR PUMPED STORAGE- AND HOW DOES THAT COMPARE TO USING THAT EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY FOR SOME OTHER- SOME OTHER ENERGY PRODUCING- CAPABILITY BECAUSE AS WE- HAVE HAD THE QUESTION- FROM MISTER. SMITH I'M SORRY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AGREED THAT- ALL ALL CORRECTOR BUT- AS WE HAD A QUESTION ABOUT- THE NEW NORMAL WE HAVE IN TERMS OF WATER SUPPLY. WE MAY NOT HAVE ENOUGH WATER. TO BE ABLE TO CONSISTENTLY USE THAT SO IS THIS GOING TO BE THE BEST INVESTMENT OF THAT SOLAR ENERGY- IS MY QUESTION- WHEN WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACTUALLY HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY. SO DO YOU HAVE DATA ON HOW EFFICIENT THAT IS VERSES- THE OTHER POTENTIAL USES OF THAT SOLAR ENERGY THAT EXCESS SOLAR ENERGY. FOR TO PRODUCE OTHER RENEWABLE ENERGIES. FOUR YEAH THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MEMBER IT'S MAYBE TWO PIECES TO THAT ONE AS A RELATED TO THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY. OF THE SYSTEM SO I'M STORAGE- IS GENERALLY A CLOSED SYSTEM WHERE YOU HAVE TO WATER BODIES THAT YOU'RE TRANSFERRING. WATER TO AND FROM IN THE CASE OF A QUORUM BELL WILL ALSO HAVE- NO FLOW THAT COMES INTO THE LAKE AND PASSES OUT OF THE LAKE- SO IT'S A COMBINATION OF PROCS- BUT BUT GENERALLY THE LAKE YOU KNOW UNDER. MOST OPERATIONS SCENARIOS HAS THE CAPABILITY TO. TO OPERATE A HIGH IN IN THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE HYDROLOGY- WE SEE IN THE STATE. AT THIS YEAR WAS AN EXAMPLE THOUGH WERE YOU KNOW UNDER AN EXTREME DROUGHT CONDITIONS- THERE COULD BE NO SOME TOP GAMES WHEN- WATER AVAILABILITY BECOMES A FACTOR- THE OTHER PART OF THE QUESTION IS RELATED TO THE EFFICIENCY OF THE OF THE- UPON STORAGE VERSUS OTHER TYPE ENERGY STORAGE. I THINK ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF PUMPED STORAGE IS. THAT HE- HYDROPOWER URBAN'S GENERATING EFFICIENCY AT LAKE OR A BILL IS ON THE ORDER OF NINETY FIVE PERCENT. AND THEN ARE PUMPING EFFICIENCY BACK INTO THE LAKE IS ON THE ORDER OF 8290% SO THE OVERALL ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF STORING- SOLAR ENERGY. AS YOU KNOW IN THE LAKE OR BILL'S THE BATTERY IS PRETTY HIGH- IN COMPARISON TO OTHER TECHNOLOGY. SO THE CHORE AS MY AND MY CORRECT SUGGEST THAT IF YOU USE A- A HUNDRED MAKE UP A HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY- PRODUCE ABOUT EIGHTY FIVE- WITH THE SYSTEM. THAT YOU HAVE ABOUT A VERY. FAIRLY GOOD AS- GEN- I CAN AT. IT YES. ANSWER TWO YEARS- AFTER THIS- HEARING IF THAT'S IN AND YOU MAY THIS YEAR THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WILL. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT THE NEW NORMAL IN ADDITION BEING A DROUGHT THERE RATHER IN A- OF VERY ASIAN. AND SO THE NEW NORM MAY BE WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING RIGHT NOW. DO WE HAVE IT HAVE THERE BEEN ANY OTHER YEARS AND IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS WHEN ORVILLE WAS TOO LOW TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE ELECTRICITY IT AT ANY TIME. THIS THE FIRST TIME IN THE HISTORY OF THE PROJECT- IN SO THAT THE DROP BELOW THE PLANTS. IN LATE AUGUST AND THEN WE ARE ABLE TO RESUME OPERATION IN DECEMBER. GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE IT- I BELIEVE THAT- AND THAT THAT'S IT FOR MY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS SEEING NONE- THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON NOW TO ISSUE. TO WHICH IS- THE- CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC GRID EMERGENCY GENERATOR SUPPORT. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE- MISTER LEDESMA PRESENTING ON THAT. YES A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SO DETAIL REGARDS EFFORTS AND ENERGY RELIABILITY I'LL BE READING OFF MY NOTES ON THAT CALL- BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. EFFORTS ARE TO SUPPORT THAT GRID RELIABILITY CALLED BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE RESULTING INCREASES IN WILDFIRE HEAT WAVES AND DROUGHT CONDITIONS. I TO MITIGATE THESE DISRUPTIONS GOVERNOR SIGNED AN EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION ON JULY TWENTIETH. JULY THIRTIETH TWENTY TWENTY ONE RAFTING OF THE URGENCY PROCLAMATION WITH FABULOUS THEY STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR THE CDC LICENSE. HOWARD HONORS OF TEN MEGAWATTS OR MORE THAT WOULD DELIVER NET PEAK ENERGY BEFORE OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON SEPTEMBER EIGHTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE CDC GRANTED A LICENSE FOR TWO TEMPORARY POWER GENERATORS AT THE DECOMMISSIONED GREENLEAF ONE. COGENERATION FACILITY AND YUBA CITY. AND TWO AND A LICENSE FOR TWO TEMPORARY POWER GENERATORS AT ROSEHILL ENERGY PARK IN ROSEVILLE. EACH J. L. M. TO FIVE ON PORTAL UNIT GENERATOR GENERATE UP TO THIRTY MEGAWATTS AND ARE AVAILABLE FOR DEPLOYMENT DURING A GREAT EMERGENCY DUE TO A SUDDEN ENERGY SHORTAGE RESULTING FROM EXTREME HEAT WAVES WILDFIRES OUR- AS DESIGNATED AND DIRECTED BY THE CALIFORNIA ISO. DWF DATA WE ARE DEPLOYED THESE FOR A TEMPORARY GENERATORS LAST LAST FALL. AND IS GOOD AT AND THE CC LICENSES WERE FOR FIVE YEARS. ELIGIBILITY FOR RENEWAL IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY TWENTY SIX. WE ARE ALSO ENTERED INTO SIGNED AGREEMENTS WITH BOTH SIDES THROUGH DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY THREE. OR APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED TWENTY MEGAWATTS WHICH COULD POWER APPROXIMATELY ABOUT A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES. SINCE THESE GENERATORS- WERE COMMISSIONED UNDER A DEAL WE ORDER LAST FALL HE DOUBLED OUR CONTINUES ITS WORK TO COMPLY WITH LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS WHICH IS PLASTER COUNTY AND FEATHER RIVER. TO CONTINUE THE- THE CONSTRUCTION- INSTALLING SELECTIVE CATALYTIC REDUCTION SCR SYSTEMS AND MISSION CONTROLS THAT WILL BE COMPLETED BY THIS SUMMER. AND THAT IS THAT IS TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE CC LICENSE TERMS. AND BENITA- FORTY IS A CONSTRUCTOR MINUTES BY THE LOCAL AIR DISTRICTS AND ALSO WE WOULD NEED TO BE COMPLIANT TO ALL ELECTRIC MARC STANDARDS. THE FUNDING THAT- IN THE BILL WOULD SUPPORT THE OPERATIONAL COSTS FOR THE GENERATORS AS FOLLOWS. SO THAT IT WILL ALLOW THE TO WE ARE TO MAINTAIN STAFF EXPERTISE AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS TO OVERSEE THE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE OF ALL THE UNITS AND BALANCE OF PLANT FACILITIES IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LICENSE PERMITS. REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS SUCH AS NEWARK RELIABILITY STANDARDS AND SERVING SURE THE READINESS TO OPERATE UNDER THE KALISTO DIRECTIVE. IN SUPPORT OF THE GRID RELIABILITY. AND WITH THAT I'LL- I'D LIKE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. THANK YOU- MISTER BROWN WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE THE L. L. A- REPORT. YEAH THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WE DON'T HAVE ANY ISSUES TO RAISE WITH THIS PARTICULAR BUDGET REQUEST HI HALF THANK YOU AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I ASSUME YOU HAVE. NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS. THE MORNING CARE WRINKLED BARN FINDS CORRECT IN ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BUT YOU'RE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU I WILL WANT A QUESTION THAT'S RAISED IS- THAT- THE- THE DEPLOYMENT OF AT LEAST ONE OF THESE GENERATORS- WAS IN A COMMUNITY WITH SIGNIFICANT AIR QUALITY ISSUES ALREADY- IS THERE SOMEWHERE ELSE WERE- THEY COULD HAVE BEEN LOCATED. YEAH HI THIS IS A JEWEL AND AS MILLION SO WHEN THE- EMERGENCY PROCLAMATION WAS DECLARED AND D. W. R. I COLLABORATED WITH THE CDC AND THE CAROLINAS SO TO IDENTIFY ALL POTENTIAL SITES AROUND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WENT THROUGH A- TWO TIERED APPROACH TO LOOK FOR THE YOU KNOW MOST SUITABLE SITE AND- ENVIRONMENTAL SENSITIVITY AREAS WERE TAKEN INTO- INTO ACCOUNT UNFORTUNATELY. YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT A THEY WERE NOT A LOT OF SITES THAT WERE READILY AVAILABLE TO BE- CONSTRAINED AIRED AND YELL THE PROCUREMENTS AND CONSTRUCTED BY THE FALL. AND SO THE LIST REALLY DWINDLED DOWN TO ABOUT FORTY SITES THAT. WE WERE WE REALLY PASSED THE FIRST LEVEL OF TEAR SCREENING WHEN WE GOT TO THE SECOND TIER SCREENING WHICH REALLY THEN LOOK THAT. AS WELL AS ALL THE EQUIPMENT TO READ TO INTERCONNECT TO THE GRID TRANSFORMERS INTERCONNECTED BILITY IS THERE ANY NATURAL GAS- TO PASSAGE IF THERE ARE- YOU KNOW WATER FOR THE TURBINES. WHEN REALLY IN THAT NARROW THAT DOWN ONLY TWO SITES. REALLY MET THE CRITERIA TO BE ABLE TO YOU KNOW- CONSTRUCT THESE GENERATORS AND SO ROSALYN YUBA CITY. WERE THE. ONLY TWO SITES THAT MET THE CRITERIA. THANK YOU I WATER THE PLANTS- FOR THESE GENERATORS AT THE END OF- OF THE CONTRACT- IS THE DEPARTMENT- GOING TO EXTEND THE CONTRACT SELL THE GENERATORS WHAT'S THE- IS THERE A IS THERE A PLAN FOR. WHAT HAPPENS. YOU KNOW THERE'S NO DIRECT PLAN FOR THESE GENERATORS THIS FUNDING IS JUST OPERATED MAINTAINED AND I'D IMAGINE THAT THIS SUMMER. YOU KNOW THE WORKING WITH THE CDC AND THE CAROLINAS SO WE'LL BE WORKING WITH THEM TO DETERMINE WHETHER THERE'S A NEED TO. YOU KNOW THAT WHAT THE WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE FOR THE GENERATORS TO SUPPORT GRID. RELIABILITY. THANK YOU- ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. MISTER. TEN THANK YOU- JUST JUST CURIOUS WHY YOU SETTLED ON NATURAL GAS VERSUS LOOKING AT OTHER- ENERGY SOURCES ESPECIALLY AS THE CHAIR HAD TALKED ABOUT THIS BEING ONE OF THE MOST POLLUTED AREAS OF THE STATE AND OBVIOUSLY PROBABLY FURTHER EXACERBATE THAT. YOU KNOW WHEN THE TEAM OF THE W. ARE IN C. C. IN THE COLLEGE SO LOOKED AT YOU KNOW HOW WHAT WAS THE FASTEST WAY TO GET EMERGENCY GENERATORS ONLINE PORTABLE GENERATORS WERE. REALLY THE ONLY OPTION AVAILABLE AND REALLY NATURAL GAS AND- DIESEL WERE THE TWO FEELS THAT THESE PORTABLE GENERATORS RUNS FROM OF. COURSE WE OPTED IN. THE STATE OPTED FOR NATURAL GAS. THE CALLOUS- ALSO LOOK THAT. IF NO OTHER PROJECTS THAT WERE ALREADY IN THE QUEUE FOR BATTERY STORAGE OR ANY OTHER. CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES BUT NONE OF THEM COULD BE EXPEDITED TO GET ONLINE- BY THAT FALL SO THE DECISION WAS THAT THIS WAS THE CLEANEST- FORM OF POWER WE COULD GET. UNDER THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS WHAT WAS AVAILABLE. GOT A TO JUST SO WE UNDERSTAND JUST THE DIFFERENCE IN TIME FRAME WHAT WHAT WOULD YOU SAY- THE TIME FRAME WOULD HAVE BEEN IF WE DECIDE TO GO WITH BATTERY STORAGE. YEAH I CAN'T REALLY EXPRESS AND PROBABLY MORE OF A- TO EASIER CALLOUS SO QUESTION BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES REALLY MANAGING THE QUEUE. I'M NOT SURE WE CAN GET THAT INFORMATION FOR YOU OKAY WHAT WE HAVE CC HERE SO C. C. CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION. THE AVERAGE MODESTO HERE IT. CAN YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION. YEAH THE QUESTION TO THE QUESTION WAS- MISTER LEDESMA TALKED ABOUT HOW. AFTER EVALUATING A VARIETY OF ENERGY CHOICES THAT THAT NATURAL GAS PORTABLE GENERATORS WAS CONSIDERED THE- THE FASTEST AND THE QUICKEST- BETWEEN THAT IN DIESEL I GUESS THAT THE CHOICE WAS. MADE BETWEEN NATURAL GAS AND DIESEL MY QUESTION WAS. HOW BIG A TIME DIFFERENCE WOULD HAVE BEEN IF WE HAD GONE WITH. A CLEANER ENERGY LIKE BATTERIES LIKE SOLAR BATTERY STORAGE. HEY THIS IS FOR THIS IS THE LEAST I COULD HEAR THEM FROM THE ASSESSMENTS DIVISION- I AM HOPING THAT- WE HAVE. SOMEONE FROM OUR CITING DIVISION ON TO RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION BURKE LET ME SEE IF I CAN GET AN ANSWER FOR THAT- AND IF WE CAN CONTINUE THE QUESTIONING AND- I WILL CHIME IN. THAT THAT THAT'S GREATER THAN I GUESS THIS IS JUST A FOLLOW UP AS WELL WHEN IT HONESTLY WHEN WIND WAS WHAT DID YOU FIRST START LOOKING AT- THESE RESOURCES- YES. WELL THE- WAS MADE JULY THIRTIETH SO. YOU KNOW EARLY AUGUST AND MAYBE IN THE DAYS AFTER THAT IS WHEN THE DEPARTMENT. AND IT'S EASY IN THE CAROLINAS SO STARTED LOOKING FOR. SITES THAT COULD BE A- THE BILL SOME STARTED USING EARLY AUGUST- TWENTY TWENTY ONE. CORRECT OKAY AND ART ARE DEADLINE WAS- AS THE ORDER SAID WHEN THEY NEEDED TO BE OPERATIONAL PRIOR TO OCTOBER THIRTY FIRST SO FROM A CONSTRUCTIVE BILITY. THAT IS REALLY FAST TIME FRAME BLESS YOU ACTUALLY STEPPED UP AND- COMMISSIONED IN FIFTY ONE DAYS WHICH IS. IN MY IN MY OPINION- RECORD TIME YEAH NOT NOT FLAT AFTER A BRIGHT FREESHEET THE EFFORTS TO WIN TO REALLY GET THESE- TURK TURBINES I THINK THE QUESTION IS THAT. FROM YOU KNOW WE HAVE WE HAVE A STATE GOAL TO GO TOWARD A 100% RENEWABLE ENERGY STATE GOAL TO BE- MOVING TOWARD CLEAN CLEAN ENERGY SO IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE AGENCIES THAT ARE REALLY IN CHARGE OF CREATING THE LEADERSHIP- TOWARDS THAT GOAL- SOMEHOW. YOU KNOW IT IGNORED IT AND DECIDED TO GO WITH A- DIRTIER SOURCE AT A TIME WHEN THESE COMMUNITIES OBVIOUSLY NEED THE ENERGY BUT ALSO AT A TIME WHEN THE THESE COMMUNITIES NEED IN ADDITIONAL MEDICATIONS SO THEY SEEM TO BE ON THE FORTY EIGHT THE AGENCIES WERE TRUSTING TO CLEAN. THE AIR AND CLEAN THE ENERGY- SEEM TO IGNORE IT WHEN IT WAS CONVENIENT UNFORTUNATELY PROPER CC PERSONAL. I KNOW YOU'RE LOOKING FOR- SEAN PETARD GOOD MORNING THIS IS DAMON NOT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IT DOESN'T APPEAR THAT SEAN IS ON THE LINE- BUT WE WILL WORK WITH ENERGY COMMISSION COLLEAGUES TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT ANSWER. THANK YOU KNOW LIKE THIS IS BECAUSE FROM THE PC I CAN'T ANSWER SPECIFICALLY TO THIS EFFORT BUT ANECDOTALLY. IN THE- PC DIRECTED UTILITY- THE I USED TO. DO AS MUCH PROCUREMENT UNDER ARMOR AGENCY PROCUREMENT- PROCEEDINGS AS POSSIBLE FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME STARTING QUITE A BIT EARLIER. AND THEY ARE THEY WERE REALLY. THEY WERE DOING THEIR LEVEL IDEA. ANY STATESIDE BATTERIES WOULD BE AVAILABLE AND DEPLOYED ON A FAST TURNAROUND. I DON'T THINK IT AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SO- BUT WITH A LOT MORE LEAD TIME AND I DON'T THINK THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN. THAT YOU KNOW POSSIBLE THEY WOULD OF A POSSIBLE FOR THEM TO TURN THAT REQUEST AROUND IN TWO MONTHS AND- AT THAT POINT IN TIME BY JULY- EITHER YOU ARE WITH THE COMPETING. WITH. PROJECTS ALREADY BEING- PLACE THE ELUSIVE THE SAME TIME SO I CAN JUST SAY. I'M TRY TO I DON'T BELIEVE. I FROM PERSPECTIVE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO GET BETTER. ADDITIONAL BATTERIES WHAT WE ARE ALREADY DEPLOYING. ARE LOCATED AND PUT IT SERVICE WITHIN A MONTH OR TWO AT THAT POINT IT'S- GONNA THANK YOU SUGGEST BUT JUST GO BACK TO THE QC. BUT IT IS CLEAR THAT THE PROCUREMENT DIRECTIVE IS TO PRIORITIZE CLEAN ENERGY. OVER DIRTY ENERGY IS THAT CORRECT. YES WE YOU KNOW WE APPLIED A SORT OF LOADING ORDER. TO THE DIRECTION WE GAVE WITHIN THE- EMERGENCY PROCUREMENT PROCEEDING TO GO AFTER. YOU KNOW BATTERIES- DEMAND SIDE RESOURCES LIKE DEMAND RESPONSE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND- A- VARIETY OF OTHER RESOURCES AND THAT AND THEN. YOU KNOW IT EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS AT AT POWER PLANTS THAT WOULD ACTUALLY PRODUCE. THE SAME OR MORE POWER FOR. MORE POWER FOR THIS THE SAME OR LESS THAT. INCREMENTAL ENERGY SO THAT'S GOT THE APPROACH WE TOOK. PERFECT SO IT'S NOT THINKING I ADD A LITTLE MORE INFORMATION BECAUSE THE STATE I THINK DID TAKE A VERY PROACTIVE APPROACH. THESE GENERATORS PORTABLE GENERATORS TYPICALLY DO NOT HAVE S. C. OURS. TO EAT YOU KNOW THEY ARE VERY CLEAN GENERATORS THE STATE INVESTED IN S. C. A. R.'S. WHICH IS AN UNTYPICAL FOR PORTABLE GENERATORS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WERE USING THE BEST. OF THE BEST TECHNOLOGY FOR A MISSION CONTROLS AND THEN SECOND THESE GENERATORS WILL ONLY BE OPERATED UNDER. CAROLINE STILL EMERGED- EMERGENCY- ORDERS SO THEY WILL NOT BE BUILT INTO THE MARKET SO THEY WILL NOT BE RUNNING AS A MARKET YOU KNOW IS A TYPICAL. OF A GHASTLY GENERATOR SO WILL ONLY BE USED FOR GOES. UP EXTREME CASES RUBBER BULLET AND I SHOULD ACTUALLY. ACTUALLY NUMBER. THE LIST OF HEARING SO. OKAY QUESTION SO YOU'RE $ BUT THERE ARE GOING TO BE. USED OUR MERGE SORT WHICH GENERAL WILL BE DOOR WILD FOR SEASON WHEN THE AIR THE MOST POLLUTED SO YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING A DIRTY ENERGY SOURCE TO FURTHER POLLUTE THE AIR DURING WILDFIRE SEASON. AND YOU'VE BEEN COMING TO COME TO THIS COMMITTEE YOU'RE ASKING FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND YOU HAVEN'T DEMONSTRATED- EXACTLY WHAT THE PC JUST SAID. WHICH IS THAT YOU NEEDED TO PRIORITIZE CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES FIRST. IN NOBODY HERE. CAN TELL US WHY YOU'RE PROCURING DIRTY ENERGY TO BE USED DURING WILDFIRE SEASON TO FURTHER POLLUTE THE AIR WHEN THERE'S ALREADY POLLUTED. SO I'M NOT I'M I'M JUST HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING WHY NOBODY HERE. IS ABLE TO ANSWER THE MOST SIMPLE QUESTION AS TO WHY WE DIDN'T USE A RENEWABLE SOURCE. DRIVE OVER PART OF FINANCE I THINK I JUST GRABBED ELABORATE WHEN MR THAT THAT MEANT THAT. WHEN TO BE PROCURED WHICH IS UNDER LAST YEAR'S ENERGY- AND EMERGENCY THERE WAS A TIME FRAME WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO STAND THEM UP IN ORDER TO HAVE THEM AVAILABLE TO ADDRESS POTENTIAL- KIND OF ENERGY SHORTFALLS- AND SO. IN THAT TIME FRAME THERE WAS AN ALPHA CONDUCTED AND B. WERE. AVAILABLE OPTION TO CONSTRUCT AND GET THEM IN PLACE HI. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE HYPED DURING THAT TIME I APPRECIATE THAT THERE WAS ANALYSIS CONDUCTED. HOW COME NOBODY IS HERE IN THE COMMITTEE. PRESENTING THE ANALYSIS THAT. WHO WHO DID THIS ANALYSIS WORTH. AND ALSO MYERS AT AND LOOK AT MY AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU HAD SINCE AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY NINE AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE SO IT'S FOURTEEN MONTHS NOT TWO MONTHS. SO I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW CAN YOU COME TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU DON'T HAVE THE ANALYSIS THAT YOU SAID WAS CONDUCTED THE PERSON WHO CONDUCTED THE ANALYSIS IS NOT HERE. AND IN YOUR IN YOUR COMMENT TO THIS COMMITTEE IN ASKING FOR MONEY. YEAH SO WE COULD DEFINITELY CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP WITH THE QUESTION YOU HAD ON HOW MUCH LONGER IT WOULD HAVE TAKEN- TO GENERATE BE OR TO PUT IN PLACE THE OTHER. HAVE A CLEANER ENERGY OUT THERE WE DON'T HAVE THAT WRITTEN IN TODAY'S BILL BECAUSE THAT BUT WE DEFINITELY DID TAKE THAT INTO CONSIDERATION. BUT WILL DEFINITELY GET THAT RESPONSE BACK YOU UP AGAIN THIS REALLY WAS JUST. INTENDED TO BE COVERED AT THE CONTINUE THE GREENBERG AT THE OTHER PEOPLE KNOW WHICH LAST YEAR- ENERGY EXECUTIVE ORDER. ACKNOWLEDGE THE POTENTIAL AIR QUALITY CONCERNS THAT WERE CAUGHT. AND ACTUALLY DIRECTED B. THE AIRPORT THEN ALSO LOOK AT WAYS TO MITIGATE EQUALITY IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH LAST YEAR THE CONTROL- EMPLOYEE IMPACT LOCALLY WE DID NOT NEED TO YOUR GENERATOR LAST YEAR. WELL THERE WERE NOT ANY KIND OF ADDITIONAL EMISSIONS PRODUCED LAST YEAR. AND THIS YEAR IN ORDER O CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AND IT'S RIDDLED WITH THE VIOLATED. WHICH WE ARE INVESTING AT THE AT THE ARE YOU KIND OF MAGICAL. TO BE ABLE TO THE- ANY POTENTIAL KIND OF AIR QUALITY AND BACK. WHEN WE BROUGHT INTO. AND BE RESTORATION. PLAN IS WHY LAST YEAR WE DID HAVE. THAT KIND OF CONTINGENT- IF THERE ARE MISSION- INCREASES. THAN WHAT ABOUT HELP ALL IN THE COMMUNITY AND LIKELY TO HAPPEN- BUT THEN MOVING FORWARD FOR THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS WHILE WE DETERMINE MORE LOCKER READY. LEAVE AIR MISSION BECAUSE THEM WORK. THAT WE GOT MY POURED YOUR- OR ACTION FROM LEGISLATURE. BADMINTON TO CUT. BE THERE QUALITY IMPACT WHAT I DID WE RUN IT BETTER IF GETS VERY WHAT. I STILL DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW YOU COULD DO AN ANALYSIS THAT SOMEHOW YOU DON'T WANT TO SHARE WITH US AND COMMITTEE ONE SO YOU WANT TO GET BACK TO US LATER. SO I REALLY WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO BE MUCH BETTER PREPARED WHEN YOU COME THROUGH THIS. THROUGH ALL THE DIFFERENT COMMITTEES IT SEEMS THAT. EVERY TIME A MAN COMMITTEE PEOPLE CAN'T AFTER THE MOST SIMPLE BASIC QUESTIONS IN THE REFER TO THINGS THAT THEY DON'T REALLY HAVE- I DON'T REALLY. HAVE THE ABILITY TO PRESENT SO EITHER YOU NEED TO REALLY RETHINK WHO'S PRESENTING FOR ANY COMMITTEE. OR YOU NEED TO BE MUCH BETTER PREPARE. SO WE HAVE A- QUESTION- THAT IS STILL UNANSWERED- I'M GONNA ASK- THE AGENCY- TO LET US KNOW WHEN MADE AVAILABLE TO US. AND THAT WOULD BE A WHEN I SAY TO US I MEAN ON LOG OF COMPACTED. OF JUST GIVE ME A MOMENT. WE GET AN ANSWER TO MY QUESTION. THERE'S A SOME KIND OF KIND OF SORT OF ANALYSIS OR REPORT OUT THERE THAT- YOU REFER TO. WHEN WE'LL BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT AVAILABLE TO THE CHAIR AND TO THE COMMITTEE. OF THE. THE DIABETIC TIME FRAME WILL WORK INTERNALLY WITH OUR ENERGY COMMISSION- CAL I FEEL CORNERED EITHER OF YOUR HELP- CAN REVIEW THAT USUALLY LAST NUMBER AND BE ABLE TO WRITE IT ALL OUT HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU NEED I UNDERSTAND YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY TO ANSWER MY QUESTION I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T GIVE A TIME FRAME NOW ABOUT HOW MUCH TIME DO YOU NEED TO GIVE US A TIME FRAME WITHIN WHICH YOU'LL PROVIDE THE INFORMATION. WE COULD GIVE YOU A TIME FRAME- LATER THIS WEEK AND FROM THE WAY WE COULD PROVIDE IT BECAUSE OF THE WEATHER YOU CAN PROVIDE IT I. DON'T WANT TO COMMIT CONNECT THE WE HAD TO GO BACK AND- EARLY DEATH. WHAT IS AROUND THE VEHICLE NOW- BUT YEAH WE COULD FOLLOW UP WITH THE COMMITTEE THAT WE GET FROM THE- A TIME FRAME TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION. I THINK- MISTER SMITH AND MR PATTERSON- EACH ONE OF US THE QUESTION. WITH A-FOLLOW UP. WITH QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS. YOU HAVE THE REPORT RIGHT NOW WE SHOULD HAVE THAT REPORT BY THIS AFTERNOON. SOMEBODY'S GOT TO PUSH A BUTTON ON THE COMPUTER WE SHOULD HAVE THAT REPORT RIGHT NOW. UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO GO IN THERE AND ADDED TO THIS REPORT. THE MAKES YOU LOOK BETTER AGAIN. BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT OUT WELL I WON'T LEAVE IT ALONE I'M A GO AFTER SOME MORE OPPORTUNITIES HERE. YOU COME HERE AND ASK FOR THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS. BUT YOU'VE ALREADY SPENT A HUNDRED SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS THROUGH D. R. E. A- TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR J. L. B. E. AND THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EARLY ACTION. SB ONE FIFTEEN. LAST YEAR. IT'S A PRIME EXAMPLE FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE WATCHING. AS GOVERNMENT RUNS AMOK. ONE AGENCY ISN'T WORKING WITH THE OTHER AGENCY. AND WE'RE- WE ARE GOING AFTER EACH OTHER IN THE TAXPAYERS ARE PAYING FOR THAT. THIS EMERGENCY WAS NOT ON FOR SEEN OR HEARD OF SUDDEN. IN THE GOVERNOR. IN HIS ADMINISTRATION SEEING THIS COMING ANY ANYBODY IN THE REPUBLICAN SEE THIS. THE NUCLEAR POWER PLANTS THE BEEN CLOSED DOWN. SANTA NO FREE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE DIABLO CANYON IS LOOKING THE TWO TWENTY AT TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. HYDROELECTRIC POWER THE BILL DEMOLITION OF THE LAMBETH RIVER DAM. AND FIT IN THE FAILURE TO BUILD SIGNIFICANT NEW HYBRID ELECTRIC POWER PLANTS SURE WE CAN SAY IT'S GLOBAL WARMING RAINS NOT COMING WE'RE NOT STORING WATER CALIFORNIA. BUT WE'RE TEARING DOWN DAMS THAT ARE ALREADY IN PLACE TO PRODUCE CLEAN ENERGY IN THIS STATE AND I CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY ONE GOVERNMENT AGENCY CAN'T WORK WITH ANOTHER ANOTHER IN THE ADMINISTRATION BEING FORTHRIGHT WITH THE CITIZENS OF CALIFORNIA SPENT A LONG TIME AGO NOT IN AN EMERGENCY. FOR THE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY OF BIOMASS POWER PLANTS IN MORE HYDRO ELECTRICITY IN THE STATE. MAYBE YOU CAN GET BACK WITH SOME ANSWERS ON THAT FOR ME SO I WOULD KNOW WHAT GOVERNMENT AGENCY ISN'T TALKING TO EACH OTHER OR WORKING WEEKLY WITH EACH OTHER. AND THAT'S THE PUBLIC'S MONEY THAT YOU ARE PRETTY MUCH WASTED BECAUSE WE CREATE. AN EMERGENCY. WHEN WE DON'T NEED TO HAVE AN EMERGENCY IN THE STATE. MISTER PATTERSON. I'M MEMBERS I'VE SPENT NINE YEARS- GOING ON TEN YEARS AS THE- VICE CHAIR OF UTILITY. AND ENERGY. BOB I THINK WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PREDICAMENT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS IN RIGHT NOW. AND THE PREDICAMENT IS THAT. WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY. DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE IMMORAL ELECTRONS AND MORAL ELECTRONS. AND WE'RE MAKING A VERY VERY DIFFERENT DIFFICULT TO USE THE IMMORAL ELECTRONS. NATURAL GAS IT'S AFTER. AND YET IT IS THOSE VERY IMMORAL ELECTRONS THAT ARE KEEPING OUR LIGHTS ON. WE HAVE HAD IN THESE. EMERGENCY CIRCUMSTANCES WE HAVE HAD BECAUSE THE WIND DOESN'T ALWAYS BLOW THE SUN DOESN'T ALWAYS SHINE. ACKERLEY AT TIMES WHEN WE NEED A RELIABLE ENERGY WE GET- INTERMITTENT ENERGY. AND THERE ARE IN FACT ELECTRONS THAT WE HAVE DETERMINED TO BE A MORAL THE LIGHTS ON. AND SO I THINK IT'S RATHER DISINGENUOUS FOR US TO. JOINT FINGERS AT THE ADMINISTRATION OR AT THE THESE PEOPLE HAVE A VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE IN FRONT OF THEM. INCREASING DEMAND AT A TIME WHEN WE ARE DECOMMISSIONING SIGNIFICANT ENERGY AT TIMES WHEN WE NEEDED. AND WHAT YOU THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE TODAY. WE ARE INCREASINGLY SEEING AN UNRELIABLE GRID. AND WE ARE SO INCREASINGLY SAYING A HUGE SPIKE IN THE COST OF ELECTRICITY TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE REPRESENT. AND I THINK THAT- IT IT IS A- RELATIVELY FOOLISH AARON I TO TRY TO LEGISLATE THAT YOU KNOW BUT AGAINST THE PHYSICS OF THE MOVEMENT OF ELECTRONS. AND THE REALITY IS THAT WE KEEP THE LIGHTS ON BY USING THESE NATURAL GAS PLANTS BY IMPORTING ELECTRICITY ACROSS OTHER STATE LINES AT THE TIMES THAT. WE NEEDED. SO ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE THIS- NO NOTION OF- THAT PERFECT IN MORAL ELECTRICITY. WHAT IMPACT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE SUFFERING RIGHT NOW THROUGH THE LACK OF THE KIND OF ELECTRICITY THAT WE HAVE BECOME ACCUSTOMED TO. I THINK CALIFORNIANS DESERVE TO BE ABLE TO GO TO THE- POWER GRID. TURN THE LIGHTS ON AND AGAIN TO THE ELECTRICITY AND FIND IT AVAILABLE AND AFFORDABLE. AND YET IN MY DISTRICT. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ADVERTISING THAT IN ORDER TO SAVE CALIFORNIA AND KEEP IT GREEN. THAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE NOT TO USE OUR ELECTRICITY BETWEEN FOUR O'CLOCK AND NINE O'CLOCK. PM TO REALIZE WHAT KIND OF. CHALLENGE THAT PRESENTS TO PEOPLE WHO LIVE NORMAL ORDINARY NINE TO FIVE LIVES. WE HAVE A WE HAVE A WE'VE AGREED THAT WE'RE BASICALLY SAYING ISN'T AVAILABLE OR USEABLE. BUT BECAUSE THE ELECTRICITY ISN'T AVAILABLE THERE. AND SO THE OVER RELIANCE ON THE- MORAL ELECTRONS AND THE SHEDDING OF THESE IMMORAL ELECTRONS. HAVE CREATED A CIRCUMSTANCE IN WHICH IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE ARE RECEIVING FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLAR PG&amp;E BILLS. I MY DISTRICT IS BEING- INUNDATED WITH PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING MY OFFICE AND SAID WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE. SO I JUST WANT TO RAISE. THE OBVIOUS HERE. THAT IF WE ARE SO. INTENT ON STRIPPING CALIFORNIA FROM THESE IMMORAL ELECTRONS. WE HAVE A CONSEQUENCE THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CREATING REAL DIFFICULTIES FOR THE BACK VERY PEOPLE WE SAY WE CARE ABOUT. AB PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC- WE HAVE SOMETHING LIKE IT I THINK IT WAS LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND. ELECTRICITY ACCOUNTS- THAT WERE TERMINATED BECAUSE PEOPLE COULDN'T PAY THEIR BILLS THAT'S NOT EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS LIKE EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCOUNTS THERE MIGHT BE THREE FOUR FIVE SIX PEOPLE. WE ARE CREATING ELECTRICITY SCARCITY. AND WE ARE CREATING ELECTRICITY THAT IS INCREASINGLY UNRELIABLE AND WE ARE ASKING OUR CONSTITUENTS BETWEEN FOUR O'CLOCK AND NINE O'CLOCK TO STOP LIVING THE KIND OF LIFE THAT THEY HAVE BEEN ACCUSTOMED TO. AS I JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT. AND REYES THE OBVIOUS OF. THE INTENTIONS MAY BE NOBLE. BUT THE EFFECT IS REALLY DETRIMENTAL TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE SERVE AND THAT'S THE KIND OF FRUSTRATION AND DIFFICULTIES THAT ARE ENERGY PEOPLE IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH HAVE TO FACE. THERE'S A REASON THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY'RE DOING THAT WE HAVE AND THAT'S AVAILABLE AT A TIME THAT WE NEED TO. AND I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO RECOGNIZE AND UNDERSTAND THE DILEMMA- THAT WE ARE CREATING BY THE POLICIES THAT WE ARE ARE PURSUING. AND WHEN WE RELY ON THE IMPORTATION. OF ELECTRICITY FROM FROM OTHER STATES. IN A AYE AYE POSITIONS THEY SAY WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO STRIP SEARCH THOSE ELECTRONS AT THE BORDER. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE MORAL OR IMMORAL- WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION THAT OBLIGATIONS TO PROVIDE RELIABLE AFFORDABLE ELECTRICITY. TO THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA WHEN THEY NEEDED REGARDLESS OF THE TIME OF DAY AND I THINK WE'RE MISSING THAT MARK. THANK YOU- I THINK WE'VE GOTTEN THAT PRETTY FAR AFIELD FROM THE CORE QUESTION HERE- THAT THE CHAIR WAS ASKING WHICH IS- WHERE'S THE UNDERLYING INFORMATION- REGARDING- A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT- BUDGET REQUEST- THAT IS THE TOPIC. OF THIS HEARING AS FOR THE SUBJECT OF- LIKE TRENDS AND YOU KNOW. YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN- OF MOVE THIS INTO A DEBATE ABOUT THE CLIMATE CRISIS BUT THE REASON WE TALK ABOUT CLEAN ENERGY THEM THE REASON- WE ARE MOVING. AS QUICKLY AND AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE- A TOWARDS CLEAN ENERGY IS THAT WE ARE. EXPERIENCING THE CLIMATE CRISIS IN REAL TIME WITH WILDFIRE WITH EXTREME HEAT WITH- OF THE MANY OTHER SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE OF A CHANGING CLIMATE THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO A IN MANY WAYS TO THE PRODUCTION. AND THE CONSUMPTION OF ENERGY FROM- OF- CARBON HEAVY SOURCES WE COULD THE UP MOVE BACK TO COAL FIRED THE PRODUCTION OF ENERGY IF WE WANTED TO- BUT THAT WOULD PROVE TO ONLY. HASTEN THE OF VERY MANY SYMPTOMS THAT WE SEE. OTHER OF A RELATE TO THE CLIMATE CRISIS SET UP MR BENNETT LET'S TRY TO STAY ON THE TOPIC HERE AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A QUESTION THAT RELATES TO- OUR EARLIER CONVERSATION ARE HOPING THAT THERE'S SOMEBODY. HERE STILL MIGHT BE ABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION THAT YOU DIDN'T ASK EARLIER THANK YOU AND I WILL. HAVE- HE'S MY QUESTION A TRANSITION THE OTHER WAY I DO APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENT ABOUT WE COULD GO TO COAL AND PEOPLE COULD CONSUME ALL THE ELECTRICITY WATER BETWEEN FOUR O'CLOCK AND AT AT AT HIGHS. NOT AND NOBODY IS SAYING THAT YOU SUGGESTED THAT- I DON'T WANNA I. DON'T WANNA I. THERE WAS A- YOU CAN ALL AGREE THE MORALITY OF ELECTRONS- THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS MY POINT IS THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS THAT WE COULD BE TALKING ABOUT- THAT. RELATE TO THE- TOPIC OF ENERGY AND THE FUNDAMENTAL ONE THAT I THINK IS- SET OF CONCERN HERE IS THE CLIMATE CRISIS MR BENNETT ALL GO IS AN APPROPRIATE TRANSITION AT AS WE ARE MAKING THE TRANSITION FROM- CARBON HEAVY ENERGY TO CLEAN ENERGY- THERE WILL BE DISLOCATIONS. AND THAT JUST INEVITABLE THAT HAPPENS EVERYWHERE WHENEVER YOU CHANGE A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S OUT THERE SO MY QUESTION RELATES TO THIS AND THAT IS DEMAND RESPONSE IS ONE OF THE APPROACHES THAT WE CAN USE- TO- TO- HELP US WHEN WE GET THESE CRISIS WHEN THERE'S A- WHEN THERE IS ELECTRICITY- SHORTAGE FOR SOME REASON WHEN THERE'S HEAVY DEMAND WHEN THERE'S MORE DEMAND ON THE GRID CAN HANDLE. AND SO WE HAVE A HOPE WE HAVE A- DEMAND RESPONSE PROGRAM OUT THERE RIGHT NOW MY QUESTION IS FOR THE C. P. U. C. A. N. FOR- THE DIRECTOR A DIRECTOR BONHAM. ABOUT THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF DEMAND RESPONSE A SPECIFIC QUESTION FOR THE CPUC. IS THIS IF WE IF WE STILL HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE THERE AND THAT IS- LAST MAY YOU HAD A HEARING AND YOU INDICATED YOU'D BE TRYING TO. EXPLORE THAT NEW WAYS THAT WE COULD REDUCE AND SHIFT THE DEMAND LOAD- WHEN WE HAVE THESE CRISIS- BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO. NOTHING'S HAPPENED SINCE LAST MAY IN TERMS OF BEGINNING THAT PROCESS- COULD YOU ANSWER WHERE THE CPUC IS ON SHIFTING ON ON- YOU HAD A WORKSHOP IN MAY AND THEN ON ON YOUR COMMITMENT. THEN- TO I TRY TO FIND A WAY TO CREATE A UP. FOR CUSTOMERS TO PARTICIPATE IN DEMAND RESPONSE AND MY QUESTION TO IT TO GET READY FOR THE- THE DIRECTOR IS THE WHOLE ISSUE OF DEMAND RESPONSE- IS ONE OF THE TOOLS THAT WE NEED TO HAVE IN OUR POCKET. IT SEEMS LIKE THAT'S DOMINATED BY THE INDEPENDENT OPERATORS AT THIS POINT TIME AND WITH TECHNOLOGY CHANGING THERE SHOULD BE MANY OTHER POSSIBILITIES FOR US TO DO DEMAND RESPONSE- IN MY QUESTION WOULD BE- HOW ARE WE GOING TO BE ABLE TO BRING THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND TO HELP US- WITH DEMAND RESPONSE WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE CAN DO AGAIN TO ADDRESS. THE DISLOCATIONS OF THAT. BY FRANKLY YOU'RE REFERRING TO WITH WITH YOUR COMMENTS YES THERE ARE GOING TO BE DISLOCATIONS THE QUESTION IS HOW WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE RESPONSE NOT THAT WE CAN GUARANTEE THERE WILL BE NO DISLOCATIONS AS WE MAKE THIS MASSIVE SHIFT. FROM FOSSIL FUEL FUEL PRODUCED ENERGY TO CLEAN ENERGY- SO- CPUC OR THE DIRECTOR ON THE ISSUE A DEMAND RESPONSE THE TWO QUESTIONS THAT I HAVE THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING- ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT AND CHAIR BLUE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS RACHEL PETERSON AND THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE C. P. U. C. ARE WE ARE VERY GLAD TO BE HERE THIS MORNING WE HAVE OUR NEXT ITEM OURSELVES ON YOUR AGENDA. AND IN THE MEANTIME- WE ACTUALLY DO HAVE SOMEONE ON READY TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION IT SIMON BAKER WHO IS. THE LEAD. OR COMMAND RESPONSE ACTIVITIES IN OUR ENERGY EFFICIENT SO OVER TO SIGN IN PLEASE THANK YOU. HI GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. YEAH SO THAT'S THANK YOU SEE I THROUGH UTILITY ADMINISTERED UTILITY PROGRAMS HAS BEEN- ADVANCE ADVANCING DEMAND RESPONSE FOR DECADES AND IN RESPONSE TO THIS MOST RECENT. RELIABILITY CRISIS WE REALLY DID ROLL UP SLEEVES TO DO A LOT MORE TO BRING MORE DEMAND RESPONSE TO THE TABLE. IN A MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE DECISION TO QC DIRECTED THE UTILITIES. TO DO A NUMBER OF THINGS IN INCLUDING LAUNCHING A BRAND NEW TEWIDE PROGRAM CALLED THE EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION. PILOT PROGRAM WHICH WE EXPECT TO BRING IN A. L. ON THE ORDER OF- SOME HUNDREDS OF MEGAWATTS. AND WHAT THAT DOES IS BASICALLY THAT WHEN THE CHI SO CALLED AN EMERGENCY- IT BRINGS AND LOAD REDUCTIONS OUT FROM. CUSTOMERS BOTH RESIDENTIAL AND NONRESIDENTIAL INITIALLY IT WAS NON RESIDENTIAL AND WE EXPANDED IT TO- TO RESIDENTIAL AS WELL. WE ALSO MODIFIED MANY OF THE EXISTING UTILITY PROGRAMS UP TO INCREASE HE INCENTIVES THAT WERE PAID- AND MAKE OTHER MODIFICATIONS TO MAKE THEM MORE- ACCEPTABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND I'M AND WE ALL STARTED HER IN A ROUGH YOU UP SO I'M NOT TRYING TO. I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU IDENTIFYING THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE DONE AND I'M I'M REALLY JUST TRYING TO FOCUS ON- JUST TO SAVE EVERYBODY TIME HERE IT WAS WITH A LONG COMMITTEE HEARING AND SAVE YOU. WHAT ARE WE- ARE WHEN ARE WE GOING TO BE STARTING WHAT WHAT WAS COMMITTED TO WHICH IS- THE PROCESS OF- COULD BE MADE- IT TAKING ACTION TO TRY TO CREATE MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR CUSTOMERS TO PARTICIPATE THERE'S- GONNA BE A NEW EXPLORATION. IS DESERVES ARE GONNA BE SOME NEW EXPLORATION SO IF YOU HAVE INFORMATION ON THAT I'D LIKE TO HEAR. THE INFORMATION ON WHAT WE ALREADY ARE DOING GOOD WOULDN'T BE S. AS BENEFICIAL FOR ME IF. I COULD POLITELY PUT IT THAT WAY. COULD YOU HELP SURE WHAT'S OF IT MAY BE THE ROLE OF THE- OF THESE- OKAY FISHING HER PARTY. SO OKAY YEAH SO WHAT THEM IS THAT- WE ARE. AGAIN MORE RECENTLY WE IN DECEMBER OF THIS YEAR WE ACTUALLY EXPANDED THE PARTICIPATION AND THAT- EMERGENCY LOAD REDUCTION PROGRAM TO AUTOMATICALLY ENROLL. ALL RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS INTO THE PROGRAM AND SO THAT'S IN OUT ROLL OUT RIGHT NOW AND SO WE WILL SEE THIS SUMMER FOR THE FIRST TIME THAT EXPANSION- SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT IS NEW. WE'RE ALSO SEEING- A NEW PROGRAM TO BE ABLE TO PILOT- WHAT ARE CALLED VIRTUAL POWER PLANTS SO THESE ARE A BEHIND THE METER STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES BEING USED AS DEMAND RESPONSE- TO BE ABLE TO EXPORT SOME OF THAT STORAGE CAPACITY THAT WILL BE. IMPLEMENTED FOR THE FIRST TIME NOW COMING UP THIS SUMMER- AND WE ARE. CONTINUING TO EXPAND OUR- AVAILABILITY OF OPPORTUNITIES FOR THIRD PARTY DEMAND RESPONSE AGGREGATORS. TO PARTICIPATE IN PRICE- MARKETS AND ENERGY MARKETS AND- TO ACQUIRE CAPACITY PAYMENTS THROUGH OUT LOAD SERVING ENTITIES- RESOURCE ADVOCACY PROGRAM SO THOSE ARE JUST THAT A FEW OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE DOING- THAT ARE EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR DEMAND RESPONSE. IF IF WE COULD JUST A COMMENT AND I HAVE TO SORT OF A QUESTION ALSO FOR THE- A DIRECTOR BOTTOM IF- IF YOU CAN RESPOND AND THAT IS TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN. DECREASE OBSTACLES FOR EVERYBODY CUSTOMERS PRIVATE PARTIES OF PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT ARE INTERESTED IN THIS FIELD THAT WE CAN DECREASE BARRIERS FOR THEM TO PARTICIPATE- AND GET INVOLVED IN TRYING TO HELP US DEAL WITH THE ISSUE DEMAND RESPONSE I THINK THAT'S BENEFICIAL FOR- FOR ALL OF US IN CALIFORNIA IF WE CAN DO THAT- DIRECTOR BONHAM DAY. YOU HAVE A ANY ANY THOUGHTS ON- ON THAT ASPECT. THANK YOU SO I WILL JUMP IN FOR- DIRECTOR PAUL AND- HE IS AND ABSENCES MEETING FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION BUT- FOR DEMAND RESPONSE. MY NAME'S WE SHOULD TEAR AS- SIMON ALREADY TALKED ABOUT- SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE'RE WORKING TOGETHER ON. AND I JUST WANTED TO- REITERATE THE COMMENTS EARLY ABOUT- THE AGENTS WORKING. AND RESPONDING- WITH D. W. OURS ARE. TEMPORARY BACKUP GENERATORS- WE ARE- WE HAVE BEEN SINCE AUGUST TWENTY TWENTY WORKING VERY CLOSELY TOGETHER- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A RELIABLE SYSTEM AND BRING ALL THE RESOURCES TO BEAR. SO- ON THIS QUESTION OF DEMAND RESPONSE ARE WE ARE SUPPORTING- THE CQC AND EXPLORING- NEW WAYS TO BRING SURE THE ACCOUNTING METHODOLOGY IS APPROPRIATE AND- BENEFITS. ARE CONSUMERS BUT ALSO ON. BUT AT MAXIMIZER THE AMOUNT OF DEMAND RESPONSE AVAILABLE TO THE STATE SO AND THAT IS A PROCESS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON NOW. AND AND WE HAVE HELD MANY WORKING GROUP MEETINGS WITH- DEMAND RESPONSE PROVIDERS- ARE LOOKING FOR THE BEST OPTIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT- THE- DEMAND RESPONSES PROPERLY CAPTURED- FOR RESOURCE ADEQUACY PURPOSES- TO THE EXTENT THAT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN REDUCE THE EXPENSE AND YET YOU KNOW WHEN AND OF BEING INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS I WOULD JUST LEAVE IT AT THAT AND HOPE THAT- THAT WE CAN FIND WAYS TO TRY TO REDUCE THE EXPENSE OF EVERYBODY BEING INVOLVED IN THAT PROCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THAT THAT'S A QUESTION STATE THANK YOU WE'LL TAKE A BRIEF MOMENT TO- TO ASK MS RIVAS TO ADD ON TO- OF THE ATTENDANCE. RIVAS. THANK YOU THANK YOU I KNOW THAT WAS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE OF THE DAY- WE'LL MOVE ON NOW TO- ISSUE THREE. AND- THAT'S THE ICPC AUDIT TO A TRAILER BILL AND TED MISTER PETERSON- I BELIEVE YOU'LL BE. PROVIDING US WITH THE BACKGROUND ON THAT. YES GOOD MORNING CHAIR RACHEL PETERSON EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE THIS MORNING- TO PRESENT ON A PROPOSED CHANGE THAT WE WITH THAT- WE ARE SEEKING TO MAKE. OF IN OUR AUDIT SEEING ON OF THE ELECTRIC GAS WATER AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ENTITIES THAT ARE UNDER AUDIT AUTHORITY- AND AS YOU ARE AWARE JUST TO TAKE A STEP BACK WHAT WE'RE PROPOSING TO DO IS TO MODIFY EXISTING AUDIT REQUIREMENTS FOR THOSE ENTITIES. FROM EIGHT LEADING HER HÌNH DRIVEN METHODOLOGY TO A RISK BASED METHODOLOGY AND SPECIFICALLY THE PROPOSAL REQUEST AMENDMENTS TO PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE SECTIONS THREE ONE FOUR POINT FIVE. SEVEN NINE TWO POINT FIVE AND TWO SEVEN FOUR THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH AUDIT AND INDUSTRY CURRENT BEST PRACTICES WE REALLY BELIEVE THAT THIS WOULD MAKE IT OUR OFFICE MORE. IMPACTFUL FOR RATEPAYERS. CHANGES WOULD INTO A BASED MY- TO ALL OF THE AUDITS THAT WERE REQUIRED TO PERFORM. FOR THESE REGULATED INDUSTRIES AND JUST TO PROVIDE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW IT WOULD PLAY OUT- IF GRANTED THIS- PROPOSAL EVERY YEAR WE WOULD EXAMINE ALL OF THE ENTITIES THAT WE COULD AUDITS. IDENTIFY AND RISKS AND THOSE THAT IDENTIFICATION OF RISKS WOULD HELP US CREATE AN ANNUAL AUDIT PLAN. AND EVALUATE THE RISK ACCORDING TO THE REAL TIME EVENTS IN EACH INDUSTRY. SO FOR EXAMPLE. AS YOU PARTY NOTED AS YOUR MEMBERS THE PARTY NOTED TODAY. BUT INDUSTRY FACING SIGNIFICANT IT GREAT INCREASES THAT IN AND OF ITSELF COULD BE A RISK THAT PLAYS INTO OUR- RISK ASSESSMENTS AND THUS OUR AUDIT PLAN IN OUR DECISION ABOUT WHICH ENTITIES TO AUDIT. OTHER EXAMPLES OF RISKS THAT WE MIGHT THINK ABOUT WOULD BE THE OVERALL REVENUE BALANCE OF AN ENTITY SO A SIZE LARGER REVENUE BALANCES WOULD LEND ITSELF TO MORE INTEREST FROM AN AUDITING PERSPECTIVE. THE LENGTH OF TIME SINCE AN ENTITY ENTITY WAS LAST AUDITED. AND THEN WHETHER OUR AUDITS AUDITORS OR ANOTHER ENTITY HAVE FOUND. ANY ISSUES IN PASSED AUDITS. NOW WHAT WOULD NOT CHANGE UNDER THIS. ARE THOSE THAT WE FALL. OUR AUDIT DIVISION PERFORMS EVERY AUDIT ACCORDING TO GOVERNMENT AUDITING STANDARDS AND THERE WOULD BE NO CHANGE TO THAT PRACTICE. THIS IS ONLY ABOUT CHANGING HOW WE DECIDE WHICH ENTITIES TO AUDIT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WITH THIS CHANGE I WOULD HAVE BETTER ABILITY TO DIRECT OUR AUDITING DIVISION TOWARD HIGHER RISK ENTITIES. WE WOULD HAVE BETTER ABILITY TO RESPOND IN REAL TIME TO EVENTS AND ULTIMATELY DRIVE OUT THAT AUDITING VALUE THAT IS SO IMPORTANT AND SO IMPACTFUL FOR REPAIRS. THERE'S A CLEANUP LANGUAGE IN THE- PROPOSAL AS WELL- BUT THERE WAS MY REMARKS AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'RE NOT NOT A QUESTIONS YET- WILL I HEAR FROM THE ALEJO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- STOP ON THIS ISSUE- IN CONCEPT WE SUPPORT THE OVERALL INTENT TO USE THE A RISK BASED APPROACH TO AUDITING AS A MORE EFFICIENT WAY TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES. HOWEVER AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROPOSAL INCLUDING. KEEPING REQUIREMENTS FOR LARGE AUDITS OR A REGULAR AUDITS OF LARGE UTILITIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL AUDIT FINDINGS WHILE ALSO PROVIDINGSOME FLEXIBILITY MAY BE FOR LESS FREQUENT AUDITS OF THE SMALLER LESS RISKY UTILITIES SO. SOMETHING LIKE THIS COULDSTRIKE A MORE- MORE OF A MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN KIND OF PROVIDES MORE FLEXIBILITY WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING SOME MINIMUM LEVEL OF REQUIREMENTS FOR THAT THE LARGER RISK. UTILITIES SO THERE'S INTEREST BY THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE IN YOUR STOP TO EXPLORE THESE TYPES OF MODIFICATIONS AS THE REMAINDER OF. THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS GO FORWARD. THANK YOU JUST A PART IN A- HAVE ANY TO ADD. NEVADA DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE NOTHING TO ADD AT THIS TIME ALTHOUGH WE'RE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANKS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER PATTERSON HAS QUESTION. WELL NO I MEAN I WAS THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AB TEN SEVENTY TWO WAS INTRODUCED IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE STATE AUDITOR'S TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT ON THE TRANSPARENCY OF WATER RATE INCREASES. AND AMONG THE STATE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS WAS THAT THE CPC WAS NOT CONDUCTING AUDITS AS FREQUENTLY AS REQUIRED. AND THERE WAS A CONCERN EXPRESSED THAT SOME OF THE AUDITS THAT WERE CONDUCTED DID NOT FULFILL THE INTENT OF THE LAW. AB TEN SEVENTY TWO PROVIDED. CLARITY TO THE SMALL WATER AND TELEPHONE PROVIDERS ABOUT THE TIMELINE AND THE STANDARDS ON WHICH THE CPUC MUST COMPLETE AN AUDIT. OR REVIEW OF THEIR UTILITIES. THESE ISSUES HAVE BEEN ONGOING CONCERN FOR THE SMALL REGULATE WATER SYSTEMS IN MY DISTRICT AND OTHERS STATEWIDE. THE BILL WAS NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THE CPUC COMPLIES WITH THE AUDITING STANDARDS OUTLAWED STATUTE IN A TIMELY AND TRANSPARENT MANNER. AT MEMBERS THIS BILL PASSED THE LEGISLATURE SEVENTY FOUR TO NOTHING. AND WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR INTO LAW SEE. AUDIT IN THE SPECIFIC AREAS WITHIN THAT FIVE YEAR PERIOD AND INSISTED IN THE LEGISLATION THAT THE AUDIT MUST THESE AUDIT SHOULD BE COMPLETED BY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. NONE OF THOSE AUDITS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED AS YET. SO THIS LEGISLATURE HAS ACTED THE GOVERNOR HAS SIGNED. AND NOW WE SEE A REPEAL EFFORT. I HAVE TEN SEVENTY TWO BY A BUDGET. AND RUN. THEY WANT TO REPEAL TEN SEVENTY TWO. THEN TAKE IT UP WITH THE LEGISLATURE. BUT TO DO THIS IN THIS MANNER. IS TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT GIVES THIS A PRIORITY. TO UNDERMINE THE DIRECT AND EXPRESSED WILL THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND IT LEADS ME TO ASK THE QUESTION WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO HIDE. OF ALL ASSUME THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION A QUESTION BEING ASKED OF THE- A- QUESTION. AND DOUG SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE- WE WILL NOW I'LL I'LL ASK IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM OR MEMBERS ON NON DISCUSSION ITEMS ON THE AGENDA. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS THEN WE WILL MOVE ON TO PUBLIC COMMENT. EVERYONE WILL HAVE ONE MINUTE TO SPEAK AS I INDICATED EARLIER- IS THERE ANYONE IN THE ROOM WHO WISHES TO GET PUBLIC COMMENT. SEEING NONE- ALL REMIND THOSE WAITING TO GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE PHONE. THAT THE PHONE NUMBER IS. EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN. AND THE ACCESS CODE ONE THREE ONE. FIVE FOUR FOUR SEVEN OPERATOR. DO WE HAVE ANY INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT. YES WE DO MISTER CHAIR AND AS A REMINDER LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU DO WISH TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE COMMENT. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE. TWENTY SIX.

ANALOG GREAT DAN ENERGY EFFICIENCY WE'RE ALSO COLLECTING ONE BILLION DOLLARS TO CONSTRUCT AN UPGRADE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE CENTERS LIKE SCHOOLS LIBRARIES AND OTHER PUBLIC BELT. THIS CAN TO BILLION DOLLAR INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. WILL HELP REDUCE CLIMATE CHANGE POLLUTION. AGAPE THE IMPACTS OF EXTREME HEAT CREATE GOOD PAYING JOBS AND BUILD PLANTS CLIMATE RESILIENCE FOR CALIFORNIA. ABOUT THE WONDER QUICKLY COMMENT ON THE GREEN HYDROGEN ABOUT THE WE KNOW THERE'LL BE A ROLE FOR HYDROGEN IN THE- FUTURE BUT WE BELIEVE DUE TO IT EXPENSE IT SHOULD BE RESERVED FOR VERY DIFFICULT TO ELECTRIFY ACTORS. WE ALSO AGREE WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BENNETT THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. ALSO ON THE FINDER OF THE RENEWABLE. HYDROGEN AND NOT WASTE TIME ON BRIDGE TECHNOLOGY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. THANK YOU. I'LL GO TO LINE HAND. GOOD AFTERNOON SHARON MEMBERS TREAT THE COOK ON BEHALF OF ECUADOR- THIS IS ONE OF THE OFFSHORE WIND- COMPANIES VERY INTERESTED IN DEVELOPMENT OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA FIRST AND FOREMOST WE WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR ITS ROBOTS SUPPORT AT EIGHTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE LAST YEAR THAT THE- CHIU BILL THAT GOT THE BALL BALL ROLLING ON PROJECT DEVELOPMENT- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL FORTY FIVE MILLION OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. GIVEN THE NEED TO ANALYZE CAPABILITIES AND MAKE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL UPGRADE SUPPORT AND LEVERAGE FEDERAL FUNDING THE INDUSTRY IS RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING AN INCREASE TO ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- TO DEVELOP YOU KNOW ABOUT FOR THE TEN GIGAWATTS OF OFFSHORE WIND POWER IN THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THAT GOOD DIALOGUE ON THE TOPIC EARLIER. LINE. TWENTY THREE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS BEDS WERE LARGER WITH THE CLIMATE CENTER OF. THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT WE WANT TO EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION GENERAL LEADING TOWARDS CLIMATE BUT WANTED TO EXPRESS THE FACT THAT WE WERE DISAPPOINTED THAT THERE WERE NO SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS AND LOCAL ENERGY PRESENT TECHNOLOGIES MEASURES- WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY HERE EIGHT THIRTY THREE. WHICH WOULD PROVIDE PLANNING BONDS FOR GENIE ENERGY RESILIENCE PLANS AT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WE WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THAT EFFORT. ADDITIONALLY WITH MICROLINER COMMENTS WITH THE SIERRA CLUB'S TO INVEST IN THE INITIAL INVESTMENT OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE NUTRACEUTICAL COUNCIL COMMUNITY RESILIENCE HEALTH PROGRAM. AND FINALLY WE RECOMMEND THAT YOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND BE ALLOCATED OVER SEVERAL YEARS TO FIND BEHIND THE- OUR SELECTED PROJECTS WERE CRITICAL SO IF. THEIR TURN TO COMMENT THANK YOU TURN MAKE YOU COPY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL UNDER ONE BILLION DOLLARS PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR EQUITABLE DUTY CAR PROGRAM WHICH SONG WE SUPPORT THE FUNDING TARGETED TOWARDS LOW INCOME RESIDENTS TO PROVIDE EFFICIENT ALL ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP FOR COOLING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND BUILDING INFLATION AND FEELING HOWEVER WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN THE MINISTRATION ON DESIGNING A PROGRAM THAT WILL PREVENT DISPLACEMENT AND RENT INCREASES AND ALLOW FOR HABITABILITY AND OTHER HEALTH RELATED IMPROVEMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE MAKE THE MOST OF THE DEPARTMENT BASSINET. AND A COMPLEMENT OF ABOUT FIFTY SUPPORT INVESTING ADDITIONAL BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CONSTRUCTION OF AN UPGRADED COMMITTEE REBELLION CENTER THE PROCEDURE GROWTH CAPITAL WHICH WE ALSO SUPPORT THE PROPOSED% FUNDING FOR THE INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION PROGRAMME INDUSTRIAL SECTOR IS THE MAJOR SOURCE OF EMISSIONS AND AIR POLLUTION BUT IT'S YOURS BEHIND OTHER SECTORS IN DECARBONIZING IS THE BEST NUMBER NEED IT HIGHLIGHTED FANCY COLLEGES THAT WILL SUPPORT WORKING CLASS JOBS. IT FUNDING MUST BE CONDITION THOUGH ON ENSURING THAT PROJECTS DELIVER COMMUNITY BENEFIT THAT ALIGN WITH OUR CLIMATE AND AIR QUALITY STANDARDS AND FINALLY ON THE PROPOSED FUNDING FOR HYDROGEN I WE STRONGLY SUPPORT PROGRAM AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO DEVELOP HYDROGEN MARKET IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE URGE YOU TO RETAIN A FOCUS ON ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN MADE WITH CLEAN ELECTRICITY ELECTROLYZER TECHNOLOGY WHICH HAS THE MOST POTENTIAL TO PROVIDE YOU BOOK- CENTER AND WE APPRECIATE ASSEMBLYMEMBER POLICEMEN BENNETT COMMENT ON THAT EARLIER THANKS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY.
