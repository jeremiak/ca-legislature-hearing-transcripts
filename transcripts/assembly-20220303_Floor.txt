THE CLRK WILL READ H. R. NINETY FOUR WITH THE PURPOSE OF ADOPTION. HOUSE WAS LUCIA NINETY FOUR BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY AND OTHERS RELATIVE TO UKRAINE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TO EUROPE THE BEST. CALL IS THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS TO PRESENT A RESOLUTION REGARDING THE SITUATION IN UKRAINE. THIS GREAT CIRCUMSTANCE AFFECTING THE PEOPLE YOU CRAM AFFECTED LOCAL. AND I GOT TO PUT IN PERSPECTIVE YOU KNOW WORDS MULTIPLY ON THIS FLOOR. AND SOME WORDS ARE ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT AND RICH IN THEIR MEANING. WE START OUR SESSIONS WITH. I PLEDGE ALLEGIANCE TO THE FLAG. AND I KNOW THAT TOUCHES EACH ONE OF OUR HEARTS. OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM YOU KNOW FRANCIS SCOTT KEY WROTE THAT HE WAS LOOKING AT HER WAS APPROVAL FAR HE WAS LOOKING AT THAT FORTRESS THROUGH THE NIGHT BOMB BLAST WENT OFF AND SEE THAT THE FLAG WAS STILL THERE. OUR NATIONAL ANTHEM STIRS OUR HEARTS AND IT IS WORDS OF TERRORISM FROM AFAR. IN HISTORY AND IN SPACE. AND I SAY THIS BECAUSE I WANT YOU TO REFLECT FOR A MOMENT ON THE OPENING LINE. OF THE UKRAINIAN NATIONAL ANTHEM. WHAT DID THEY CONJURE UP. TO BE THE OPENING LINE. OF THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM. GLORY N. FREEDOM OF UKRAINE. HAS NOT YET PARISHED. THESE ARE POWERFUL WORDS TO REFLECT UPON A PEOPLE FIGHTING FOR THEIR LIVES. AND YET THOSE ARE THE WORDS THAT. FIND THEIR HEARTS TOGETHER. CONVEY THEIR SENSE OF THEIR FUTURE THEIR PURPOSE. SO COLLEAGUES I AM HONORED TODAY I REPRESENT REALLY HERE SECOND ACCOUNTED THE LARGEST DIASPORA OF UKRAINIAN. EMIGRES IN THE WORLD AS WE IN CALIFORNIA DO. BUT IS A VERY VERY LARGE POPULATION HERE AND BACK IN. NINETEEN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WHEN THEY STARTED SENDING TRUCKLOADS OF PERISHABLES AND FOOD UKRAINE BECAUSE THIS SAME POWER WAS ENCROACHING AND US AND OUR LAND I WAS HONORED TO JOIN WITH MY COMMUNITY AND DO THE RIBBON CUTTING FOR THAT FIRST TRUCK. BUT THIS IS A VAST COMMUNITY IN OUR STATE. AND CERTAINLY HERE A SECOND A COUNTY. MR KILEY IN MY DISTRICT TOGETHER. ON FEBRUARY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY TWO RUSSIAN INVADED ITS NEIGHBOR UKRAINE THREATENED OUR DEMOCRATICALLY ELECTED GOVERNMENT IN ATTACK THE VIOLATES THE RULE OF LAW. NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY AND FREEDOM MAKHOSI. AND AS A FREELY ELECTED DEMOCRACY UKRAINE AND PRESERVE. ZIELINSKI SHERMAN AT THE SAME DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES WE DO AND CALIFORNIA AND ARE FIGHTING TO DEFEND AND PRESERVE THESE IDEALS OPENING LINE OF THEIR NATIONAL ANTHEM GLORY AND FREEDOM OF UKRAINE HAS NOT YET PARRIS. THE UNITED STATES OUR ALLIES QUICKLY CONDEMNED THE ACTIONS OF RUSSIAN PRESIDENT. BUT PUTIN AND MOBILIZED TO SUPPORT THE PEOPLE OF UKRAINE. AND HOLDING PRESSURE GOVERNOR ACCOUNTABLE FOR ITS AGGRESSION. AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT THEY'RE JUST A LONG HISTORY GLORIA AND FREEDOM OF YOU CAN IS NOT YET PERISHED. BACK IN NINETEEN THIRTY TWO. THIS PEOPLE WERE SUBJECT TO A ORCHESTRATED FAMINE. WHICH KILLED 25% OF THE PEOPLE OF RURAL UKRAINE. REFERRED TO AS THE WHOLE OF THE MORE A MAN MADE GENOCIDE. DESPITE IT BEING ONE OF THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AREAS IN THE THEN SOVIET UNION. A BREAD BASKET AND YET PEOPLE DIED. BY A FAMINE. TWO THOUSAND FOR THE RECRUITING PEOPLE GAYS IN MASS PROTESTS AGAINST ELECTORAL FRAUD CORRUPTION IN EVENT KNOWS YARDS REVERSES THEIR DEVOTED TO DEMOCRACY. FLORIAN FREEDOM HAS NOT YET PERISHED. AGAIN IN TWENTY FOURTEEN THEY ENGAGE IN MASS PROTESTS CIVIL DISTURBANCE% WHEN UNDER PRESSURE FROM RUSSIA RUSSIA UKRAINIAN GOVERNMENT SUSPENDED ABOVE TO GO CHANGES FOR GREATER COOPERATION WITH THE EUROPEAN UNION THAT'S EVENT AS DOES THE MEYDAN OR THE REVERSE OF DIGNITY- SO THIS IS ALL A PART OF A LONG PATTERN. IN THEIR WORLD. A PRESSURE OF INTIMIDATION OF THREAT OF VIOLENCE AND VIOLENCE IN FACT. AND THIS IS A PEOPLE. WHO HERE THERE NATIONAL ANTHEM AND HERE. GLORY AND FREEDOM OF UKRAINE HAS NOT YET PARRIS I MONITOR BRING THIS RESOLUTION BEFORE TODAY. TO STAND WITH THIS COURAGEOUS PEOPLE. AGAINST THE PREDATIONS OF THE PRESENT THE SOVIET UNION REQUEST YOUR RIVAL. WE'RE. MISTER BENNETT YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO WORLD WAR TWO CAME TO AN END. SINCE THEN WE'VE SADLY SEEN MANY INSTANCES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD WERE. RUTHLESS DICTATORS BRUTALLY ATTACK INNOCENT PEOPLE. TOO MANY EXAMPLES FAR TOO MANY IN AFRICA IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA AND CENTRAL EUROPE. I THINK WE SHOULD ASK OURSELVES WHY DOES THIS PARTICULAR CRISIS IN UKRAINE RISE TO THE LEVEL WHERE WE TAKE THE UNUSUAL STEP OF DOING A RESOLUTION LIKE THIS. AND I WOULD OFFER TO YOU THAT THIS IS THE STRONGEST PARALLEL. TO THE BEGINNING OF WORLD WAR TWO THAT WE'VE HAD IN THE LAST SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS. A RUTHLESS DICTATOR USING FABRICATED STORY LINES IS ATTACKING A SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC NATION OF BRAVE INNOCENT PEOPLE IN CENTRAL EUROPE. PUTIN NOT THE RUSSIAN PEOPLE PUTIN IS COMPLETELY TRAMPLING THE INTERNATIONAL PRINCIPLES OF LAW AND ORDER THAT HAVE KEPT US FROM HAVING ANOTHER WORLD WAR IN THE LAST SEVENTY SEVEN YEARS. THIS WEEK A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE YESTERDAY I'M SORRY A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE NATIONS IN THE WORLD LARGE AND SMALL. ADOPTED A RESOLUTION AT THE UNITED NATIONS CONDEMNING PROVEN FOR THIS. BRUTAL INVASION OF UKRAINE. THOUSANDS OF BRAVE RUSSIAN CITIZENS ARE PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK TO TRY TO PROTEST IN THAT COUNTRY AND OF COURSE MILLIONS OF BRAVE UKRAINIANS ARE STANDING THERE TODAY DEMONSTRATING AND NORMA'S COURAGE IN ONE OF THE MOST DESPERATE SITUATIONS A COUNTRY CAN FIND THEMSELVES IN. AND SEARCH SEARCH SO IT IS REALLY APPROPRIATE FOR US. THE REPRESENTATIVES OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WE SHOULD AT LEAST JOIN THE REST OF THE WORLD IN CONDEMNING THIS ATROCIOUS INVASION THAT IS TAKING PLACE. I BELIEVE THIS IS ONE ISSUE. THAT ALL OF US TOGETHER INCOME THAT THAT ALL OF US CAN COME TOGETHER ON IN THIS CHAMBER AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR UNANIMOUS VOTE IN SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER PATTERSON YOUR RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK MEADOW SPEAKER AND A MEMBERS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT. BUT THIS RESOLUTION AND AS A REPRESENTATIVE FROM CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WITH A SIGNIFICANT UKRAINIAN POPULATION I STAND WITH THEM AS WELL. BUT LET'S NOT MAKE ANY MISTAKE ABOUT IT. TODAY THE RUSSIAN ARMY AT THIS MOMENT IS COMMITTING WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. THIS ON THE DIRECT ORDER. A BLADDER PUT. THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. MUST DO SO MUCH MORE THAN JOINING TOGETHER IN RESOLUTIONS LEGAL AID. WHICH IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT. BUT THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY MUST HOLD VLADIMIR PUTIN RESPONSIBLE FOR WAR CRIMES AND CRIMES AGAINST HUMANITY. HE IS KILLING CIVILIANS HE IS HE DESTROYING UKRAINIAN CULTURAL ASSETS. HE IS TARGETING INNOCENT NONCOMBATANTS. HE MUST BE INDICTED. BEFORE THE NATIONAL COURT OF JUSTICE. N. B. HOLD TO ACCOUNT. FOR HIS CRIMINAL ACTIONS. HIS CRIMINAL ACTS. CANNOT BE ALLOWED. EAGLE CHALLENGE IN THE INTERNATIONAL COURTS. THE MISTER PUT. WE CANNOT BE ALLOWED. TO ESCAPE THE RIGHTEOUS JUDGMENT OF THE LAW. MISTER LIVIGNO RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR NINETY FOUR AND I STAND WITH THE SOVEREIGN DEMOCRATIC NATION OF UKRAINE AND ITS PEOPLE AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR INTRODUCING THIS RESOLUTION AND FOR BRINGING ATTENTION TO AN ISSUE THAT I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT WHICH IS THE RECENT ATTACK NEAR THE HOLOCAUST MEMORIAL AT BABI YAR. AND IT CALLS ONE OF THE PRE TAX THAT HE NEEDED TO PUSH BACK ON THE **** THAT AND THE NEO **** HAVE TAKEN OVER THAT COUNTRY. AT THE SAME TIME WE KNOW IT'S BEEN SHARED THAT. THE PRESIDENT OF UKRAINE IS JEWISH IN FACT THE PRIME MINISTER OF UKRAINE IS JEWISH. AND THAT THIS PRETEXT OF USING THE HOLOCAUST AGAINST PEOPLE IN EUROPE. AND AGAINST PEOPLE WHO ARE JEWISH STANDING UP TO RUSSIA IS ONE OF THE OLDEST DISEASES OF EUROPE. THAT WE NEED TO CALL THIS OUT THAT TO AS NOT KONTRON SKI THE FORMER SOVIET REFUSENIK IS NOW A MEMBER OF ISRAEL'S KNESSET SAID THAT PUTIN HAS SOUGHT. TO THE STORE IN IN IN MANIPULATE THE HOLOCAUST TO JUSTIFY. THIS ILLEGAL INVASION BABI YAR HAPPENS TO BE THE SITE WHERE INTEREST THE COURSE OF TWO DAYS NOT SEIZE. SHOT AND KILLED THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND JEWS AND DROP THEM INTO THE RAVINE WHICH WAS USED AS A MASS GRAVE FOR THE ENTIRETY. OF THE WAR OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BODIES EVENTUALLY WERE IN THAT ROUTINE BY THE END OF THE WAR SO WE MUST CALL OUT. THIS ANTI SEMITISM THAT PUTIN IS PUTTING FORWARD AND THIS ISN'T SOMETHING THAT'S JUST IN RUSSIA IT OR JUST ONLY IN EUROPE IT'S EVERYWHERE. AND OVER THANKSGIVING FAMILY OF MINE GOT TOGETHER FOR THE FIRST TIME IN YEARS FROM THREE DIFFERENT STATES AND BROUGHT FAMILY MEMENTOS. TOGETHER AND WE LOOKED AT THEM OLD PHOTOS. AND I NOW HAVE MY GREAT GRANDMOTHER ANNIE'S. NATURALIZATION PAPERS. FROM THE NINETEEN THIRTIES. AND SHE CAME FROM THIS PART OF EUROPE. IN THE UNITED STATES. ON HER NATURALIZATION PAPERS HAD HER RACE MARKED ON HER PAPERS AND HER RACE THEY MARKED WAS HEBREW. SO LET'S REMEMBER HOW PEOPLE SEE JEWS AS DIFFERENT THAN OTHER IN EUROPE AND THIS EXTENDS FAR BEYOND EUROPE AND THAT IS STAND UP AND WHEN IT'S USED THIS ANTI SEMITISM MISTRUST DISTORTION OF THE HOLOCAUST WE MUST CALL IT OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT BECOME A BIGGER PROBLEM FOR THE WORLD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER MATHIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER. I TO RISE IN SUPPORT. WE ALL MUST STAND WITH THE SOVEREIGN NATION OF UKRAINE. THIS IS THE FIRST MILLENNIAL COMBAT VETERAN. WITH A PURPLE HEART ELECTED TO STATE OFFICE IN THE COUNTRY I FIND THIS DEEPLY DISTURBED. BECAUSE I'VE ACTUALLY FOUGHT IN COMBAT ON THE GROUND. I UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON THERE BECAUSE I'VE LIVED IT. COLLEAGUES ARE RIGHT WE HAVE TO CALL OUT RUSSIA WE HAVE TO CALL OUT PUTIN. WHAT HE IS DOING IS AN ABSOLUTE CRIME ON HUMANITY. THERE'S AN OLD SAYING. IF YOU WANT PEACE PREPARE FOR WAR. IN ORDER TO DO THAT. WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THINGS LIKE ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT GETTING DIRTY BLOOD OIL FROM RUSSIA. WHEN WE CAN DO IT HERE AT HOME CLEANER AND BETTER THAN THE OTHER GUY. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE GOING FOOD SO WE CAN SEND SUPPORT IN AID. BUT YET WE'RE CUTTING AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE BEST WHEN IT COMES TO STEM EDUCATION BRIGHTEST MINDS. TO DEAL. WITH THESE CRAZY DICTATORS LIKE PUTIN. BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO WAR. THE SIDE WITH THE RESOURCES WITH THE TECHNOLOGY WITH THE FUEL IS A SIDE THAT WINS. THE VERY SIMPLE EQUATION. WE CANNOT ALLOW THIS ATROCITY TO CONTINUE. WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PRODUCING HERE AT HOME. THE OTHER NIGHT. MUCH AS I HATE TO SAY IT PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS RIGHT WE HAVE TO DO THIS HERE AT HOME. AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD THIS YEAR. AS WE ALL STAND. TO UNITE BEHIND UKRAINE WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE IS A BODY. IS A STATE. IS THE FIFTH LARGEST. ECONOMY IN THE WORLD.

AND THE CURRENT MILITARY GENERATIONS. I GREW UP IN FREEDOM. THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO DOWN. AND HERE'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN. I DID TWO COMBAT TOURS IN VIETNAM AND I NEVER DREAMT LITTLE RICE FARMERS COULD BE THIS. SO WHAT YOU MAY SEE IN UKRAINE. IS THE INVASION OF AFGHANISTAN BY RUSSIA IN NINETEEN SEVENTY NINE. THEY WERE THERE FOR TWENTY YEARS G. DOES THAT SOUND FAMILIAR. THE RUSSIANS LOST FIFTEEN THOUSAND DEAD. AROUND THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND WOUNDED. AND IT GOT SO BAD THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WAS FOR BUILDING FUNERALS. BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T WANT THAT TO GET OUT WE DON'T KNOW ABOVE MY PAY GRADE WILL FALL. THEY'RE NOT RICE FARMERS THEY'RE FREE YOUR CRANIUM FARMERS. THANK YOU. THAT IS YOUR RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK MEMBERS I AM PROUD TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF HR NINETY FOUR WHICH CONDEMNS RUSSIA'S UNPROVOKED INVASION OF UKRAINE MAKE NO MISTAKE ABOUT IT YOU CRANE AS A SOVEREIGN NATION AND HOUTEN'S THUGGISH ACTIONS AGAINST THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE HAVE RIGHTFULLY DRAWN CRITICISM FROM EVERY CORNER OF THE FREE WORLD. CALIFORNIA MUST NOW ADD OUR VOICE TO THE GROWING COALITION BY CENSURING RUSSIA AND DOING WHAT WE CAN TO HELP THE YOUR CRANIUM PEOPLE. YOUR CRANIUM THEY'RE STANDING THEIR GROUND ON THE FRONT LINES OF DEMOCRACY. EVEN THOUGH AS THIS WAR RAGES ON THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY. WE CANNOT FORGET HOW CLOSE TO HOME THIS COMPLEX REALLY IS. JUST A FEW DAYS AGO I SAW A PICTURE OF A UKRAINIAN WOMAN MOTHER HUDDLED WITH HER DAUGHTER. DURING THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF HER CITY. THE CAPTION READ MY DAUGHTER AND I SURVIVING THE NIGHT IN UKRAINE WITH THIS CRAZY DICTATOR AND WE NEED THE WORLD'S SUPPORT RIGHT NOW. THAT NIGHT WHEN I CUDDLED WITH MY OWN DAUGHTER. AND SHE FINALLY FELL ASLEEP I COULDN'T HELP BUT REMEMBER THAT WOMAN. AND HER DAUGHTER. AND HOW SIMILAR THEY WERE TO MY FAMILY. BUT JUST HOW DIFFERENT THEIR LIVES HAVE BECOME BECAUSE OF A CONDEMNING ALL OF THAT CONDEMNABLE ACTIONS OF ONE TYRANTS. MEMBERS WE LIVE IN THE GREATEST BLANKET OF LIBERTY AND FREEDOM. AND UKRAINIANS DESERVE THE SAME. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF HRNINETY FOUR. THANK YOU MISSPELLED ADDRESS MR KILEY RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK. THANK YOU MADAM SPEAKER I I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF- REPRESENTING A REGION THAT HAS AGES TREMENDOUS COMMUNITY OF UKRAINIAN AMERICANS AND ATTENDED DOZENS OF OUR COMMUNITY EVENTS AND OBSERVERS IS THE CELEBRATIONS I SEE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FROM A RANCHO CORDOVA AND MANY OF THEM AND- THE UKRAINIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY IS SO IMPORTANT- TO THE FABRIC OF THE STATE. I RIGHT NOW WE ARE SEEING ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING IMAGES- IN UKRAINE IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JUST DESCRIBE BUT WE'RE ALSO SEEING INCREDIBLE DISPLAYS OF COURAGE AND HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE SEEING PEOPLE FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE RALLY IN SUPPORT OF YOU OUR UKRAINIAN FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS. WHAT WE HAVE WITNESSED IS AN ACT OF SHEER BARBARISM IT'S AN ATTACK ON A SOVEREIGN NATION ATTACK ON A SOVEREIGN PEOPLE MORE THAN THAT IT'S AN ATTACK ON THE VERY FOUNDATION OF THE MODERN WORLD FREEDOM DEMOCRACY. HUMAN RIGHTS AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE SPEAK IN ONE VOICE IN CONDEMNATION OF WHAT IS HAPPENING AND THAT WE USE EVERY TOOL AT OUR DISPOSAL TO GIVE THAT CONDEMNATION REAL IMPACT AND MEANING. AND MOST OF ALL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE SUPPORT OUR UKRAINIAN FRIENDS AND NEIGHBORS IN OUR COMMUNITY AND OFFER THEM EVERY MEASURE OF SUPPORT AND COMFORT AND FOR THAT WE CAN. THANK YOU. MR GABRIEL YOU ARE RECOGNIZED AT YOUR DESK ALSO RISE PROBABLY IN SUPPORT OF HR NINETY FOUR WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUE FROM MAJOR CORDOVA FOR BRING YOUR FOR I'LL BE BRIEF I DON'T KNOW IF I'VE EVER SAID THIS BEFORE THE FLOOR BUT I AGREE WHOLEHEARTEDLY AND IT'S WHOSE YEAH SICKLY WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO COUNTY AND I WANT TO APPRECIATE THIS RARE. MOMENT OF BIPARTISANSHIP WHICH I THINK IS SO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE WHAT WE ARE WITNESSING IS HE SAID THIS IS NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON A SOVEREIGN NATION IT'S NOT JUST AN ATTACK ON A SOVEREIGN PEOPLE. IN A DEMOCRACY. THIS IS AN ATTACK ON THE FUNDAMENTAL WORLD ORDER. IT'S AN ATTACK ON THE IDEA THAT COUNTRY SHOULD NEGOTIATE THROUGH DIPLOMACY. I COME TO AGREEMENTS AND A CO EXIST PEACEFULLY. THIS IS THE IDEA THAT VLADIMIR PUTIN IS ADVANCING THAT BECAUSE HE HAS POWER. BECAUSE HE HAS AN ARMY BECAUSE HE FEELS LIKE DOING SOMETHING THAT HE CAN TAKE OVER AND OCCUPY ANOTHER COUNTRY. THAT HE CAN EXERT HIS WELL ON THAT COUNTRY. AND THIS IS NOT. AS WE HAVE LEARNED IN HISTORY. WHEN DICTATORS DO THINGS LIKE THAT. THEY MUST BE MET WITH STIFF RESISTANCE. AND I'VE BEEN SO HARD TO SEE THAT IN. ICONIC PLACES AROUND THE WORLD LIT UP WITH THE COLORS OF UKRAINIAN FLAG. IF I WAS FILLED WITH SUCH PRIDE ANNOYS WALKING HOME THE OTHER NIGHT. AND SO ARE CAPITOL DOME. HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA LET UP WITH THE COLORS OF YOUR TRAINING FRIDAY. I THINK I HOPE THAT IT SENDS A MESSAGE OF. ALLY SHIP. AND REINFORCES THE INCREDIBLE COURAGE AND STRENGTH AND BRAVERY THAT WE HAVE SEEN FOR THE UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. THERE SHOULD BE NO DOUBT FROM UKRAINIAN PEOPLE THAT YOUR RESPECTIVE OF WHERE WE STAND. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ARE DOMESTIC POLITICS. WE ARE STANDING STRONGLY IN SOLIDARITY WITH THEM. AND WE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLY IMPRESSED BY THEIR BRAVERY AND THE COURAGE AND THE WILLINGNESS TO STAND UP. TO INCLUDE INCREDIBLY VICIOUS. INVADING ARMY. ALSO SUGGEST EVERYONE HERE NONE OF US WANTS. WAR NOBODY WANTS A GLOBAL WAR EVERYBODY WANTS PEACE. BUT I THINK THAT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE BACK UP OUR WORDS OF SOLITARY WITH MEANINGFUL ACTION. IT WAS VERY PROUD TO SEE THE MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE HAVE INTRODUCED. LEGISLATION TO USE OUR ECONOMIC AND A POLITICAL AND OUR MORAL POWER. TO STAND UP TO THE PUT REGIME. I WAS HARD TO SEE THAT OUR GOVERNOR IS SUPPORTING THOSE EFFORTS. WE HAVE THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AS WAS MENTIONED. WE HAVE A LARGER ECONOMY THAN RUSSIA. WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO THROUGH OUR GLOBAL GLOBAL LEADERSHIP. TO REINFORCE IN A VERY SIGNIFICANT WAY U. S. AND INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS. I HOPE THAT IN ADDITION TO THESE IMPORTANT JUST AS OF SOLITAIRE THESE IMPORTANT WORDS OF SOLIDARITY. THAT WE WILL TAKE MEANINGFUL ACTION. BECAUSE THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN WORLD HISTORY. AND CALIFORNIA HAS A PIVOTAL ROLE TO PLAY WITH THAT AND WITH TREMENDOUS APPRECIATION FOR THE BRAVERY AND COURAGE OF UKRAINIAN PEOPLE. RESPECT YOUR QUESTION I VOTE ON HR NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU MR GABRIEL SEEING AND HEARING AT NO FURTHER DEBATE ASSEMBLY MEMBER COOLEY YOU MAY CLOSE. CALLERS ARE JUST THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THIS RESOLUTION YOUR REMARKS- ALL WEEK I'VE HAD THIS PHRASE IN MY MIND. A LONG BEGINNING A MOMENT WE DO NOT ACTUALLY KNOW WHAT IS THE COURSE OF WHAT WILL TRANSPIRE IN UKRAINE. WE ONLY KNOW EACH DAY WE FIND WHAT IS THE LATEST IT IS THIS LONG BEGIN A MOMENT IT IS A MOMENT WHERE. I KNOW. SACRAMENTO COUNTY BUT THROUGHOUT OUR STATE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD I THINK. THERE ARE MANY FAITHS. THE PEOPLE CENTER THEIR LIVES AROUND THIS IS SURELY A TIME WHEN THEY SORT OF GO BACK TO THEIR FOUNDATIONS I THINK ABOUT WHAT TRULY MATTERS AND- FOR THE STUDENTS OF THE BIBLE IN THE UKRAINIAN FAITH. THERE ARE MANY PHRASES THAT COME TO MIND BUT THERE'S ONE THAT STANDS OUT YOU CANNOT ABIDE A SITUATION WHEN PEOPLE SAY PEACE PEACE BUT THERE IS NO PEACE. SO I THINK THAT IS THE MOMENT OF THE MODERN AGE FINDS ITSELF IN LOOKING AT WHAT IS TRANSPIRING. NOT WISHING TO HAVE OUR APCAR APPLE CARTS OF PEACE UNSETTLED. REALLY SAY WHAT IS THE PATH OF PEACE. AS A- WE REMARKED ON THIS FOR IN MANY DIFFERENT WAYS SO. I REQUEST OF THE FIRST ROLE BUILDING FOR COAL AUTHORS I THANK YOU FOR YOUR SOLIDARITY HERE AND FOR THE- UNANIMITY OF VIEWS EXPRESSED.
