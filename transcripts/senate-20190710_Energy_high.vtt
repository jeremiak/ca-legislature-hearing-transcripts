OF HOMES DESTROYED BY WILDFIRE.

00:07:01.988 --> 00:07:04.290
NUMEROUS FIRE SAFETY EXPERTS AND

00:07:04.357 --> 00:07:05.858
ADVOCATES FOR NON COMBUSTIBLES

00:07:05.925 --> 00:07:06.959
OWNED WITHIN FIVE FEET SORRY

COMBUSTIBLE SO WITHIN FIVE FEET

00:07:09.896 --> 00:07:11.197
OF A STRUCTURE.

00:07:11.264 --> 00:07:12.698
AS AN EFFECTIVE WAY TO PROTECT

00:07:12.765 --> 00:07:14.333
STRUCTURES SUCH AS YOU THE UC

00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:15.535
DIVISION OF AGRICULTURAL NATURAL

00:07:15.601 --> 00:07:16.869
RESOURCES.

00:07:16.936 --> 00:07:18.471
A FORMER STATE FIRE MARSHAL AND

00:07:18.538 --> 00:07:19.772
THE NATIONAL FIRE PROTECTION

00:07:19.839 --> 00:07:21.174
ASSOCIATION.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:22.909
AB FIFTEEN SIXTY MORE PHASE AND

00:07:22.975 --> 00:07:24.544
A NON COMBUSTIBLES ON ONE OF THE

00:07:24.610 --> 00:07:26.012
THINGS WE LEARN FROM THE MOST

00:07:26.078 --> 00:07:27.446
RECENT FIRES WAS THAT.

00:07:27.513 --> 00:07:28.948
HAVING NON COMBUSTIBLE MATERIAL%

00:07:29.015 --> 00:07:30.983
RIGHT AROUND THE STRUCTURE RIGHT

00:07:31.050 --> 00:07:33.119
AROUND THE PERIMETER STRUCTURE.

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:33.686
IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT

00:07:33.753 --> 00:07:36.022
AREAS TEND TO KEEP CLEAR --

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.924
THERE WERE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES

00:07:37.990 --> 00:07:39.492
WHERE ENTIRE LANDSCAPES DIDN'T

00:07:39.559 --> 00:07:41.093
BURN NOTHING WAS WRONG WITH THE

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:42.028
TREES.

00:07:42.094 --> 00:07:43.496
THE GRASS WAS INTACT BUT BECAUSE

00:07:43.563 --> 00:07:45.231
SOMEONE HAD A PILE OF WOOD RIGHT

00:07:45.298 --> 00:07:46.766
NEXT TO THEIR HOUSE FOR INSTANCE

00:07:46.833 --> 00:07:48.234
OR THEY HAD VINES PLANTS ALL

00:07:48.301 --> 00:07:49.635
OVER.

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:53.506
THERE BUILDING. ONE NUMBER.

00:07:53.573 --> 00:07:55.208
HIT THAT COMBUSTIBLE AREA AND

00:07:55.274 --> 00:07:55.775
WILL CAUSE THE LOSS OF THE

00:07:55.842 --> 00:07:57.009
STRUCTURE SO WHAT ONE OF THE

00:07:57.076 --> 00:07:58.477
THINGS THAT THIS BILL DOES IT'S

00:07:58.544 --> 00:08:00.847
IMPORTANT IS SET UP THIS NEW ONE

00:08:00.913 --> 00:08:01.347
TO ZERO TO FIVE FEET NOT

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:02.949
COMBUSTIBLES ON WILL STILL

00:08:03.015 --> 00:08:05.084
DETERMINE KIND OF WHAT WE THINK.

00:08:05.151 --> 00:08:06.452
CAN BE PLANTED IN THAT AREA AND

00:08:06.519 --> 00:08:07.453
WHAT COULDN'T BUT IT'LL GIVE

00:08:07.520 --> 00:08:09.655
HOMEOWNERS A LOT MORE DIRECTION

00:08:09.722 --> 00:08:11.023
AS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF KEEPING

00:08:11.090 --> 00:08:12.959
THAT AREA CLEAR OF COMBUSTIBLE

00:08:13.025 --> 00:08:15.361
MATERIAL TO THOSE PROPERTIES AT

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:15.895
BURNED A LOT OF THEM THOSE

00:08:15.962 --> 00:08:16.796
HOUSES.

00:08:16.863 --> 00:08:18.030
IT WASN'T A WALL OF FIRE THAT

00:08:18.097 --> 00:08:19.866
TOOK THEM DOWN IT WAS NOT HAVING

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.834
THAT BEARD A FIVE FOOT NON

00:08:21.901 --> 00:08:23.069
COMBUSTIBLE SOON SO THIS WILL

00:08:23.135 --> 00:08:24.737
GIVE GUIDANCE TO PROPERTY OWNERS

00:08:24.804 --> 00:08:26.839
AND ALSO TO INSPECTORS -- TO

00:08:26.906 --> 00:08:29.508
HELP WITH THAT -- AB FIFTEEN

00:08:29.575 --> 00:08:30.343
SIXTEEN WILL ALSO REQUIRE CAL

00:08:30.409 --> 00:08:31.911
FIRE TO MEET ITS GOAL OF

00:08:31.978 --> 00:08:33.579
INSPECTING EVERY KNOWN STRUCTURE

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.014
ONCE EVERY THREE YEARS.

00:08:35.081 --> 00:08:36.382
EVEN FLLOWING IN THE PRESS HAS

00:08:36.449 --> 00:08:37.450
BEEN A LOT OF REPORTS ABOUT HOW

00:08:37.516 --> 00:08:38.651
FEW OF THESE STRUCTURES AND HIGH

00:08:38.718 --> 00:08:40.286
HAZARD ZONES ARE CURRENTLY BEING

00:08:40.353 --> 00:08:41.254
INSPECTED.

00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.122
AND ONE OUT OF COMPLIANCE HOUSE

00:08:43.189 --> 00:08:43.756
CAN PUT AN ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD

00:08:43.823 --> 00:08:45.558
AT RISK SO IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:08:45.625 --> 00:08:46.759
THAT WE GET PEOPLE OUT IN THE

00:08:46.826 --> 00:08:48.327
FIELD TO INSPECT. TO NOTIFY

00:08:48.394 --> 00:08:49.929
HOMEOWNERS WHEN THEY HAVE

00:08:49.996 --> 00:08:51.697
DANGEROUS CONDITIONS AND WE

00:08:51.764 --> 00:08:52.965
CAN'T ASSUME THAT HOMEOWNERS NOW

00:08:53.032 --> 00:08:54.267
I'M A HOMEOWNER AND A HIGH

00:08:54.333 --> 00:08:55.635
HAZARD ZONE AND UNTIL IT SORT OF

00:08:55.701 --> 00:08:57.270
DOING THIS WORK I HAD NO IDEA

00:08:57.336 --> 00:08:58.871
THAT I HAD DANGEROUS CONDITIONS

00:08:58.938 --> 00:09:00.206
ON MY OWN PROPERTY.

00:09:00.273 --> 00:09:01.841
ACCORDING TO A NEW KQED

00:09:01.908 --> 00:09:03.476
INVESTIGATION ONLY 70% OF

00:09:03.542 --> 00:09:05.211
PROPERTIES IN THE TERRITORY WERE

00:09:05.278 --> 00:09:06.646
CAL FIRE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:09:06.712 --> 00:09:08.247
MONITORING DEFENSIBLE SPACE WERE

00:09:08.314 --> 00:09:09.815
ACTUALLY CHECKED BY THEIR

00:09:09.882 --> 00:09:11.550
INSPECTORS IN.

00:09:11.617 --> 00:09:12.785
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN AB FIFTEEN

00:09:12.852 --> 00:09:13.552
SIXTEEN WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:14.687
RIGHT TREE RIGHT PLACE FOR

00:09:14.754 --> 00:09:16.856
FUTURE PLANTING UNDER ELECTRICAL

00:09:16.923 --> 00:09:18.090
LINES AND HIGH FIRED.

00:09:18.157 --> 00:09:19.692
HAZARD AREAS THIS WILL REDUCE

00:09:19.759 --> 00:09:21.560
UTILITY BUDGET SAY VEGETATION

00:15:39.938 --> 00:15:41.840
THEY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A

00:15:41.907 --> 00:15:43.909
SPECIFIC METRICS THAT WERE USED

00:15:43.976 --> 00:15:44.310
TO DEVELOP A STATE

00:15:44.376 --> 00:15:45.577
RESPONSIBILITY AREA.

00:15:45.644 --> 00:15:47.980
THAT IS LOOKING AT FIRE HISTORY --

00:15:48.047 --> 00:15:49.915
FUELS ACROSS THE LANDSCAPE AND

00:15:49.982 --> 00:15:51.750
THE PROPENSITY OF VEGETATION TO

00:15:51.817 --> 00:15:53.719
BURN SO YES I WOULD EXPECT THAT

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:54.620
THAT.

00:15:54.687 --> 00:15:57.289
THAT MEASURE WILL CONTINUE -- WE

00:15:57.356 --> 00:15:58.590
HAVE OUR OWN SPECIFIC

00:15:58.657 --> 00:16:00.526
NEUROLOGISTS AND AND FAR CORNERS

00:16:00.592 --> 00:16:04.163
ON STAFF IT ACTUALLY HELPED IN

00:16:04.229 --> 00:16:04.730
THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MOST

00:16:04.797 --> 00:16:04.963
LATEST.

00:16:05.030 --> 00:16:06.498
FIRE BOUNDARIES AS IT PERTAINS

00:16:06.565 --> 00:16:07.866
TO THE HEART OUR THIRD DISTRICT

00:16:07.933 --> 00:16:09.134
WHICH THE CPC ADOPTED.

00:16:09.201 --> 00:16:10.769
MY AS OF BEFORE THE TWO MAJOR

00:16:10.836 --> 00:16:12.438
FIRES THEY DIDN'T WORKING FOR

00:16:12.504 --> 00:16:13.572
EIGHT YEARS AND HAD NOT

00:16:13.639 --> 00:16:14.873
COMPLETED THEM SO WAS.

00:16:14.940 --> 00:16:16.809
REALLY FRUSTRATING SO.

00:16:16.875 --> 00:16:18.544
I'M JUST HOPING CEBU SEEING CAL

00:16:18.610 --> 00:16:20.279
FIRE CAN BE HELPFUL.

00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:22.748
IN THIS FIRE HAZARDS SEVERITY

00:16:22.815 --> 00:16:25.150
ZONE -- IT WOULD MOVE WE HAVE

00:16:25.217 --> 00:16:27.619
TEARS IS IS THIS A UNIQUE.

00:16:27.686 --> 00:16:30.289
TOP TIER OR IS IT.

00:16:30.356 --> 00:16:32.124
NORMAL NOMENCLATURE SO THE SO

00:16:32.191 --> 00:16:34.793
THE APPLICABILITY OF AB FIFTEEN

00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.595
SIXTEEN WOULD BE. FOR THE STATE

00:16:36.662 --> 00:16:38.063
HIGH FIRE THREAD DISTRICTS WHICH

00:16:38.130 --> 00:16:40.432
WAS A DETERMINED BY CPC IN

00:16:40.499 --> 00:16:41.800
CONJUNCTION WITH CAL FIRE IN THE

00:16:41.867 --> 00:16:42.935
FIRE EXPERTS.

00:16:43.001 --> 00:16:44.169
AND THIS THE STATE

00:16:44.236 --> 00:16:45.804
RESPONSIBILITY AREA WHICH SHOWS

00:16:45.871 --> 00:16:47.206
FOR DICTATES THE PUBLIC

00:16:47.272 --> 00:16:48.974
RESOURCES CODE THAT CALIFORNIA'S

00:16:49.041 --> 00:16:50.476
RESPONSIBLE FOR IF YOU WOULD

00:16:50.542 --> 00:16:51.543
LOOK AT A MAP.

00:16:51.610 --> 00:16:54.279
THOSE TERRITORIES ESSENTIALLY

00:16:54.346 --> 00:16:55.781
OVERLAY AND EIGHT THE SHARE

00:16:55.848 --> 00:16:59.084
ALMOST COMPLETE -- A BOUNDARY OF

00:16:59.151 --> 00:17:00.953
COMMONALITY BOUNDARY WITH THE

00:17:01.019 --> 00:17:03.155
EXCEPTION OF SOME PORTIONS OF

00:17:03.222 --> 00:17:04.757
THE STATE RESPONSIBILITY AREA

00:17:04.823 --> 00:17:07.626
THAT FALL OUTSIDE THE H. OF TV.

00:17:07.693 --> 00:17:09.161
AND WE WE WOULD HAVE A CONCERN

00:17:09.228 --> 00:17:11.330
THAT THIS BILL WOULD NOT INCLUDE

00:17:11.397 --> 00:17:12.931
THE STATE RESPONSE VERY BECAUSE

00:17:12.998 --> 00:17:14.133
THERE ARE.

00:17:14.199 --> 00:17:15.567
PORTIONS OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY

00:17:15.634 --> 00:17:19.104
THEY JUST HAVE THE THE

00:17:19.171 --> 00:17:20.005
DEFINITION OF A STATE

00:17:20.072 --> 00:17:21.673
RESPONSIBILITY AREA BUT ARE

00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:23.675
EXTREMELY HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS

00:17:23.742 --> 00:17:26.011
AND WHAT COMES TO MIND TO ME IS.

00:17:26.078 --> 00:17:27.546
A RANCHO SANTA FE WHICH IS ONE

00:17:27.613 --> 00:17:29.048
OF THE MOST -- A DENSELY

00:17:29.114 --> 00:17:31.583
EUCALYPTUS GROVE ENCLAVES AND

00:17:31.650 --> 00:17:34.319
SEND YOU A SAN DIEGO -- AND IT'S

00:17:34.386 --> 00:17:36.288
SOME OF THE HIGHEST PROPERTY

00:17:36.355 --> 00:17:38.457
VALUE IN OUR COUNTY SO WE WOULD

00:17:38.524 --> 00:17:41.794
ENDORSE RETAINING THE HF TV AND

00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:43.395

00:17:53.806 --> 00:17:55.340
ANA END -- THERE ALREADY IS

00:17:55.407 --> 00:17:56.074
ALREADY THE AUTHORITY FOR A

00:17:56.141 --> 00:17:58.410
LOCAL JURISDICTION TO APPLY A

00:17:58.477 --> 00:17:59.945
MORE RIGOROUS STANDARDS -- AT

00:18:00.012 --> 00:18:01.713
THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR CLIMATIC

00:18:01.780 --> 00:18:03.282
GEOLOGICAL TOPOGRAPHIC FIRE

00:18:03.348 --> 00:18:04.917
SAFETY IS ONE THE MOST COMMON

00:18:04.983 --> 00:18:06.985
LOCAL MODIFICATIONS -- TO CITY

00:18:07.052 --> 00:18:08.787

00:18:12.124 --> 00:18:14.760
A LOOK OF THAT -- RANCHO SANTA

00:18:14.827 --> 00:18:18.030
FE -- WE REALIZE THAT EUCALYPTUS

00:18:18.096 --> 00:18:20.132
TREES DON'T MAKE GOOD RAILROAD

00:18:20.199 --> 00:18:20.699
TIES [inaudible]

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:23.902
BUT I'M NOT CONCERNED ABOUT A

00:18:23.969 --> 00:18:24.503
NEIGHBORHOOD LIKE THAT BUT I'M

00:18:24.570 --> 00:18:25.671
CONSIDER ABOUT IN A NEIGHBORHOOD

00:18:25.737 --> 00:18:27.473
THAT MIGHT BE.

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:32.110
LOWER IN THE ECONOMIC -- CYCLE

00:18:32.177 --> 00:18:33.445

WAIT A SECOND CAN YOU CHANGE OUR

00:18:38.517 --> 00:18:39.351
RATING.

00:18:39.418 --> 00:18:40.919
BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MAKE

00:18:40.986 --> 00:18:42.588
THESE CHANGES IT.

00:18:42.654 --> 00:18:44.189
IS THAT IS OUR POTENTIAL THERE

00:18:44.256 --> 00:18:45.324
FOR SOMEONE SO.

00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.426
WE CAN AFFORD TO BE IN THIS EVEN

00:18:47.493 --> 00:18:49.228
THOUGH WE ARE IS OUR OR OR IS

00:18:49.294 --> 00:18:49.828
THIS IS JUST COMPLETELY SET BY

00:18:49.895 --> 00:18:53.565
THE CPUC AND AND CAL FIRE.

00:18:53.632 --> 00:18:55.467
NOT NOT REALLY -- AND THAT'S ONE

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:56.502
OF THE BEAUTIES OF THE RISK

00:18:56.568 --> 00:18:57.703
ANALYSIS TOOL THAT'S BEING

00:18:57.769 --> 00:19:00.072
DEVELOPED HERE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE

00:19:00.138 --> 00:19:01.473
SORT OF A ONE DIMENSIONAL Là

00:19:01.540 --> 00:19:02.875
MAP IT SAYS YOU'RE IN A GOOD

00:19:02.941 --> 00:19:04.910
PLACE OR BAD PLACE -- THE RISK

00:19:04.977 --> 00:19:06.812
ANALYSIS TOOL TAKES THAT SORT OF

00:19:06.879 --> 00:19:07.479
INTO A THREE DIMENSIONAL

00:19:07.546 --> 00:19:09.248
THRESHOLD WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING

00:19:09.314 --> 00:19:10.649
AT THE FIRE HARDING OF THE

00:19:10.716 --> 00:19:12.384
BUILDING THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE

00:19:12.451 --> 00:19:13.385
AND THEN LOOK AT JURISDICTION

00:19:13.452 --> 00:19:14.586
LAWYERS ISSUES.

00:19:14.653 --> 00:19:16.855
OF FIRE RESOURCE -- PERSONNEL

00:19:16.922 --> 00:19:18.924
MANAGEMENT -- BASICALLY -- IT

00:19:18.991 --> 00:19:20.325
WILL FINALLY BE A TOOL WHERE

00:19:20.392 --> 00:19:21.393
INSURANCE AND AND LOCAL

00:19:21.460 --> 00:19:23.328
JURISDICTIONS VARIETY REASON AND

00:19:23.395 --> 00:19:25.497
THE HOMEOWNERS CAN BASICALLY

00:19:25.564 --> 00:19:27.065
COME AND USE THAT TOOL AND

00:19:27.132 --> 00:19:28.667
FIGURE OUT HOW TO INCREASE THE

00:19:28.734 --> 00:19:30.235
FIRE PROTECTION OF THE DWELLING.

00:19:30.302 --> 00:19:31.236
FOR THE LEAST COST THE BIGGEST

00:19:31.303 --> 00:19:32.971
BANG FOR THE BUCK IS OW THIS

00:19:33.038 --> 00:19:33.839
TOOLS CAN WORK GREAT.

00:19:33.906 --> 00:19:35.240
THANK YOU FOR LET ME FLEX SOME

00:19:35.307 --> 00:19:37.709
OF THIS OUT BUT YOU REALLY THINK

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:38.911
THE CPUC IS GOING TO GET.

THAT HANDBOOK OUT IN A

00:19:40.646 --> 00:19:42.080
REASONABLE AMOUNT OF TIME IT.

00:19:42.147 --> 00:19:44.082
I'M SORRY BUT I CYNICAL BUT I I

00:19:44.149 --> 00:19:45.884
I I UNDERSTAND THAT -- IN THE

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.086
SECTOR IS THE LOCAL FIRE SERVICE

00:19:48.153 --> 00:19:49.855
WILL HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THIS

00:19:49.922 --> 00:19:51.423
WHICH MEANS LOCAL CITIES --

THIS PUBLIC ENTITY WOULD

ANTI CC A BILL.

00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:07.184

STAGE FOR THE NEXT ENERGY CRISIS.

00:45:37.034 --> 00:45:38.569
IN RESPONSE AB FIFTY SIX WOULD

SERVE AS A VOLUNTARY PROCUREMENT

00:46:04.628 --> 00:46:06.063

FROM CUSTOMERS.

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.044
ON AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA HAS

00:46:21.111 --> 00:46:22.679
POINTED OUT THEIR SUPPORT FOR

00:46:22.746 --> 00:46:24.114
THIS APPROACH IN THE GOVERNOR'S

IDENTIFYING GAPS ASSOCIATED WITH

EMERGING COMPETITIVE MARKETS --

00:46:34.057 --> 00:46:36.326
AND ABSENT EFFORTS TO DEVELOP A

00:46:36.393 --> 00:46:37.995
ROBUST STATE BACKSTOPS THE

CALIFORNIA'S MARKETS.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.201
THERE BY GETTING THE FEDERAL

00:46:44.268 --> 00:46:45.469
GOVERNMENT MORE INVOLVED IN

00:46:45.536 --> 00:46:47.938
CALIFORNIA'S RELIABILITY AND

00:46:48.005 --> 00:46:49.806
RESOURCE PLANNING POLICIES.

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:51.041
ON I WANT TO ALSO JUST EXPLAIN

00:46:51.108 --> 00:46:52.476
WHAT THE BILL DOES NOT DO.

00:46:52.543 --> 00:46:54.111
THE BILL DOES NOT MODIFY THE

00:46:54.178 --> 00:46:56.380
RULES PRACTICES OR REQUIREMENTS

00:46:56.446 --> 00:46:57.714

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.352
STANDARD PROGRAMS.

00:47:02.419 --> 00:47:03.987
IT DOES NOT TRANSFER ALL

00:47:04.054 --> 00:47:05.389
RESPONSIBILITIES WITH CENTRAL

RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:47:08.625 --> 00:47:09.426
AND IT DOES NOT CREATE A NEW

00:47:09.493 --> 00:47:11.195
STATE AGENCY THAT IS VESTED WITH

00:47:11.261 --> 00:47:13.397
ITS OWN POLICY MAKING POWER.

00:47:13.463 --> 00:47:14.598
THE IDEA HERE IS TO CREATE A

00:47:14.665 --> 00:47:16.633
TOOL THAT CAN BE USED BY THE PC

00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.001

CHOICES ASSOCIATION HERE IN

00:51:14.204 --> 00:51:16.006
OPPOSITION AB -- FIFTY SIX WE

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:17.374
BELIEVE THE BILL STARTED WITH

00:51:17.441 --> 00:51:18.542
THE GOAL OF ENSURING GREATER

00:51:18.608 --> 00:51:19.810
RELIABILITY AND PROVIDING A

00:51:19.876 --> 00:51:20.977
MECHANISM POTENTIALLY FOR

00:51:21.044 --> 00:51:22.712
INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES TO EXIT

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.047
FROM PROCURING ENERGY.

00:51:24.114 --> 00:51:25.916
AND WE BELIEVE THAT MADE SENSE --

00:51:25.982 --> 00:51:26.983
BUT SOMEHOW THE BILL VEERED INTO

00:51:27.050 --> 00:51:28.952
A VEHICLE TO REDEFINE BACKSTOP

00:51:29.019 --> 00:51:31.388
PROCUREMENT INSTEAD OF JUST

00:51:31.455 --> 00:51:32.022
IMPLEMENTING A CENTRAL BUYER TO

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:32.756
DO IT.

00:51:32.823 --> 00:51:34.024
THE BILL SAYS THE BACKSTOP

00:51:34.090 --> 00:51:35.826
PROCUREMENT SHOULD NOW INCLUDE

00:51:35.892 --> 00:51:37.727
THE ADVANCE PURCHASE OF ENERGY

00:51:37.794 --> 00:51:38.762
UP TO TEN YEARS AHEAD OF ANY

00:51:38.829 --> 00:51:40.530
ACTUAL NEED AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:51:40.597 --> 00:51:42.132
AB FIFTY SIX WOULD GIVE THE P.

00:51:42.199 --> 00:51:44.067
YOU SEE NEW POWER. TO ORDER A

00:51:44.134 --> 00:51:45.769
CENTRAL AGENCY TO BUY ENERGY FOR

00:51:45.836 --> 00:51:47.304
CCA'S ON THE BASIS OF A LONG

00:51:47.370 --> 00:51:49.339
RANGE PLANNING DOCUMENT CALLED

00:51:49.406 --> 00:51:50.774
AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE PLAN.

00:51:50.841 --> 00:51:52.976
NOT ON ANY ACTUAL SHORTFALL OF

RENEWABLE ENERGY OR RELIABILITY

00:51:55.412 --> 00:51:56.513
BUT ON THE SPECULATION THAT THE

00:51:56.580 --> 00:51:58.315
CCA MIGHT NOT PURCHASE ENOUGH

00:51:58.381 --> 00:52:00.717
ENERGY YEARS BEFORE IT'S NEEDED.

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:02.018
THIS ARRANGEMENT COULD MAKE

00:52:02.085 --> 00:52:03.520
SENSE IF IT WAS PART OF

00:52:03.587 --> 00:52:04.921
RESTRUCTURING P. GINNY.

00:52:04.988 --> 00:52:06.223
BUT IT MAKES NO SENSE TO TAKE

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:07.691
AWAY PLANNING AND PROCUREMENT

00:52:07.757 --> 00:52:09.226
FROM CCA'S.

00:52:09.292 --> 00:52:10.293
TODAY THE P. YOU SEE AS THE

00:52:10.360 --> 00:52:11.428
POWER TO ORDER PROCUREMENT ONLY

00:52:11.495 --> 00:52:13.163
WANT TO SEE CA HAS FAILED TO

MEET ITS COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS

00:52:14.598 --> 00:52:15.832
FILING AN INTEGRATED RESOURCE

00:52:15.899 --> 00:52:17.834
PLAN IS A COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION

00:52:17.901 --> 00:52:18.935
OF A CCA.

00:52:19.002 --> 00:52:20.337
BUT DISCLOSING A RISK FOR

00:52:20.403 --> 00:52:21.338
EXAMPLE THAT A WIND POWER

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:23.139
PROJECT MIGHT NOT BE COMPLETED

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:25.008
IN TWENTY TWENTY NINE IS NOT A

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.309
COMPLAINTS VIOLATION IT'S A

00:52:26.376 --> 00:52:27.644
PLANNING TARGET.

00:52:27.711 --> 00:52:29.079
THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT AND

00:52:29.145 --> 00:52:30.914
MAKE ANY RISK AT ALL OF THE

00:52:30.981 --> 00:52:33.583
FUTURE SHORTFALL A REASON FOR SO

00:52:33.650 --> 00:52:34.818
CALLED BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT.

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:36.319
EVEN FOR RISKS IT CANNOT BE

00:52:36.386 --> 00:52:37.287
AVOIDED.

00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:38.688
KELSEY CA SUPPORTS A TRUE

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:39.923
BACKSTOPS BILL THAT WOULD

00:52:39.990 --> 00:52:41.625
PROTECT GRADE RELIABILITY AND WE

00:52:41.691 --> 00:52:42.626
PROVIDED AMENDMENTS TO THE

00:52:42.692 --> 00:52:44.094
AUTHOR THAT WOULD DO THAT BUT SO

00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:45.595
FAR THE AUTHOR HASN'T TAKEN ANY

00:52:45.662 --> 00:52:46.730
OF OUR AMENDMENTS.

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.265
IN FACT CAL CC IS LEADING A

00:52:48.331 --> 00:52:50.500

00:53:03.747 --> 00:53:04.915
AND TO TAKE AWAY OUR ABILITY TO

A COMMENT MADE THAT THIS BILL

01:00:02.532 --> 01:00:04.100
HAS EXPANDED FROM ITS ORIGINAL

01:00:04.167 --> 01:00:05.401
PURPOSE THAT IT STARTED OUT

01:00:05.468 --> 01:00:07.570
SMALL GOT REALLY BIG IN FACT IT

01:00:07.637 --> 01:00:08.104
HAS MOVED IN THE OPPOSITE

01:00:08.171 --> 01:00:09.072
DIRECTION.

01:00:09.138 --> 01:00:10.373
SINCE THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED

01:00:10.440 --> 01:00:12.241
AND PLACED INTO PRINT -- THE

01:00:12.308 --> 01:00:13.476
AUTHORITY TO PROCURE HAS BEEN

01:00:13.543 --> 01:00:17.013
pREDUCED RELATIVE TO THE INITIAL

01:00:17.080 --> 01:00:18.614

BROADER POWERS NOW THE BILL AS

01:00:21.250 --> 01:00:22.051
IT EXISTS IN PRINT TODAY.

01:00:22.118 --> 01:00:24.754
LINKS THE ABILITY OF THIS

01:00:24.821 --> 01:00:26.923
COMMUNITY TO OPERATE ONLY TO

01:00:26.990 --> 01:00:28.891
AUTHORIZATION ALREADY PROVIDED

01:00:28.958 --> 01:00:31.060
IN EXISTING LAW FOR THE RESOURCE

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:33.696
ADEQUACY PROGRAM UNDER SECTION.

01:00:33.763 --> 01:00:34.330
THREE EIGHTY FOR THE INTEGRATED

01:00:34.397 --> 01:00:35.431
RESOURCE PLANNING PROGRAM UNDER

FIFTY ONE FOR THE RENEWABLE

01:00:39.035 --> 01:00:40.303
PORTFOLIO STANDARD PROGRAM ON A

01:00:40.370 --> 01:00:41.838

THIRTEEN ALL EXISTING LAW

01:00:45.441 --> 01:00:46.709
PROVISIONS.

01:00:46.776 --> 01:00:48.211
THERE'S NO NEW PROCUREMENT

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.545
AUTHORITY PRESENTED HERE --

01:00:49.612 --> 01:00:51.414
THERE'S BEEN CONCERNS RAISED AT

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:53.483
THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW -- THE

01:00:53.549 --> 01:00:55.551
STATE WIDE ENTITY TO GO FORWARD

01:00:55.618 --> 01:00:57.286
AND SIGN LONG TERM CONTRACTS FOR

01:00:57.353 --> 01:00:59.022
NEW RESOURCES IN THAT THAT

01:00:59.088 --> 01:01:00.790
RESULT WOULD ONLY OCCUR.

01:01:00.857 --> 01:01:03.259
IF THIS BILL WERE PASSED IN FACT.

01:01:03.326 --> 01:01:04.927
EXISTING LAW UNDER THE RESEARCH

01:01:04.994 --> 01:01:06.029
UNDER THE INTEGRATED RESOURCE

01:01:06.095 --> 01:01:07.430
PLANNING PROGRAM AUTHORIZES THAT

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:09.298
EXACT RESULT AND JUST A FEW

01:01:09.365 --> 01:01:10.867
WEEKS AGO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:01:10.933 --> 01:01:11.934
COMMISSION ISSUED A RULING IN

01:01:12.001 --> 01:01:17.907
THAT CASE -- DIRECTING COMMENTS

01:01:17.974 --> 01:01:18.741
THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:19.776
PROCUREMENT TO OCCUR OF BRAND

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.277
NEW RESOURCES IN THE STATE.

01:01:21.344 --> 01:01:23.946
AND IF SO IF ANY LOW SERVING AND

01:01:24.013 --> 01:01:26.049
HE DIDN'T SATISFY THEIR SHARE OF

01:01:26.115 --> 01:01:27.450
THAT NEED WHETHER THEY SHOULD

01:01:27.517 --> 01:01:29.085
USE A BACKSTOP MECHANISM.

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.020
AND THE BACKSTOP MECHANISM

01:01:31.087 --> 01:01:32.455
THAT'S THE UTILITIES SO.

01:01:32.522 --> 01:01:34.457
THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE ANY OF

01:01:34.524 --> 01:01:36.459
THAT IT'S ALREADY HAPPENING THE

01:01:36.526 --> 01:01:37.560
QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IN

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:39.195
THE LEGISLATURE IS DO YOU REALLY

01:01:39.262 --> 01:01:40.997
WANT THE UTILITIES TO DOUBLE

01:01:41.064 --> 01:01:42.365
DOWN ON THEIR ROLE.

01:01:42.432 --> 01:01:45.635
AS THE PROCUREMENT AND EIGHTY OF

01:01:45.701 --> 01:01:47.003
LAST RESORT FOR THE STATE.

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:48.538
WE BELIEVE THAT IT'S MORE

01:01:48.604 --> 01:01:51.040
APPROPRIATE TO TRANSPORT THAT

01:01:51.107 --> 01:01:53.776
RESPONSIBILITY TO A STATE ENTITY

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:55.511
BECAUSE WE ARE RECOGNIZING THE

01:01:55.578 --> 01:01:57.447
REALITIES ON THE GROUND TODAY

01:01:57.513 --> 01:01:58.514
WHICH IS THAT THE UTILITIES ARE

01:01:58.581 --> 01:02:00.583
GETTING SLIMMER NOT BIGGER WE

01:02:00.650 --> 01:02:01.918
WANT THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR CORE

01:02:01.984 --> 01:02:03.386
FUNCTIONS.

01:02:03.453 --> 01:02:03.853
MAINTAINING SAFETY AND

01:02:03.920 --> 01:02:05.855
RELIABILITY THIS BILL DOES NOT

01:02:05.922 --> 01:02:09.325
CONSTRAIN THE ABILITY OF ANY CCA

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:10.827

SERVE THEIR OWN CUSTOMERS AND TO

01:02:12.862 --> 01:02:15.264
BUILD THEIR OWN PORTFOLIO ON AND

01:02:15.331 --> 01:02:17.633
IT DOES NOT PROVIDE NEW WITH

01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:18.334
FORTY FOR THE COMMISSION TO

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:19.869
REGULATE CCA'S IN FACT IT'S

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:21.504
EXPLICITLY WE HAVE A PROVISION

01:02:21.571 --> 01:02:23.673
IN THE BILL THE COULD NOT BE

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:25.508
MORE EXPLICIT ON THIS POINT SO --

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:26.676
I DO SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION

01:02:26.742 --> 01:02:28.511
MISTER CHAIRMAN THAT -- SOME OF

01:02:28.578 --> 01:02:29.312
THE CRITICS THAT HAVE BEN MADE

01:02:29.378 --> 01:02:30.580
ABOUT THE BILL ARE ACTUALLY

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:33.349
ABOUT THE BILL AND PRINT THEY

01:02:33.416 --> 01:02:33.916
SEEM TO BE ABOUT SOME OTHER

01:02:33.983 --> 01:02:35.084
CONCEPT.

01:02:35.151 --> 01:02:35.718
WE'LL GO TO CENTER STONE CENTER

01:02:35.785 --> 01:02:38.521
RUBIO.

01:02:38.588 --> 01:02:40.590

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:45.428
WHAT THE PROPONENTS ARE SAYING

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.130
AND THEN IF THE S. C. E. REP

01:02:47.196 --> 01:02:49.198

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.201
WE WE CERTAINLY DO DISAGREE WITH

01:02:52.268 --> 01:02:54.837
MR FRIEDMAN'S ANALYSIS -- IT IS

01:02:54.904 --> 01:02:57.206
NOT CURRENTLY LAW THAT THE CPUC

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.374
MAY ORDER PROCUREMENT THROUGH

01:02:58.441 --> 01:02:59.709
THE I. R. P. PROCESS ON A LONG

01:02:59.775 --> 01:03:02.278
TERM BASIS WITHOUT.

01:03:02.345 --> 01:03:03.646
PROVIDING THE CCA'S WITH AN

01:03:03.713 --> 01:03:05.615
OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY TO BURKE

01:03:05.681 --> 01:03:06.249
HERE.

01:03:06.315 --> 01:03:08.184
AND EXCEPT FOR RELIABILITY

01:03:08.251 --> 01:03:09.986
PURPOSES FOR A COMPLIANCE

01:03:10.052 --> 01:03:12.622
VIOLATION THE I. R. P. ITSELF IS

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:15.291
NOT A COMPLIANCE PROCUREMENT --

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.026
PROCESS IT IS A PLANNING

01:03:17.093 --> 01:03:18.895
DOCUMENT AND WHEN THERE'S A

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.530
DEFICIENCY IN AN INTEGRATED

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.765
RESOURCE PLAN THE CBC CAN ORDER

01:03:22.832 --> 01:03:24.634
THAT DEFICIENCY TO BE FIXED TO

01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:25.168
BE CURED.

01:03:25.234 --> 01:03:26.802
AND CAN ORDER THAT PLAN TO BE

01:03:26.869 --> 01:03:29.038
REFILED -- IT DOES NOT HAVE THE

01:03:29.105 --> 01:03:30.706
POWER TO GO OUT AND BUY LONG

01:03:30.773 --> 01:03:34.076
RANGE ENERGY FOR A CCA TODAY --

01:03:34.143 --> 01:03:35.645
ON THE BASIS OF AN INTEGRATED

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:38.881
RESOURCE PLAN -- PROCESS OF THE

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:39.615
TWO THOUSAND MEGAWATTS MENTIONED

01:03:39.682 --> 01:03:41.784
AT THE CBC I MIGHT ALSO MENTION --

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:43.119
THE THE JUDGE IN THAT CASE

01:03:43.186 --> 01:03:44.520
RECENTLY NOTED THAT THAT WAS

01:03:44.587 --> 01:03:46.689
BASED ON NO DATA AND NO ANALYSIS

01:03:46.756 --> 01:03:48.424
AND WAS JUST.

01:03:48.491 --> 01:03:49.058
AN IDEA THAT THEY WERE

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:51.994
DISCUSSING SO I MIGHT NOTE THAT

01:03:52.061 --> 01:03:53.129
AS WELL.

01:03:53.196 --> 01:03:54.197

SEEMS TO BE MORE.

01:03:57.533 --> 01:03:58.801
ABOUT THE ENVIRONMENT RATHER

01:03:58.868 --> 01:04:02.572
THAN A BACKSTOP FOR PROCUREMENT --

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.240
THIS BILL IS AUTHORIZING CAP

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.275
COUGH -- TO UNDERTAKE BACKSTOP

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.743
PROCUREMENT BUT THIS PROCUREMENT

01:04:07.810 --> 01:04:08.778
SEE THE FOCUS MORE ON

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.780
ENVIRONMENTAL REQUIREMENTS NOT A

01:04:10.846 --> 01:04:11.414
SHORTAGE OF ELECTRICITY IT LIKE

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.448
YOU.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:15.785
TO COMMENT ON THAT ALSO -- WHEN

01:04:15.851 --> 01:04:17.286
BE SURE THAT THE POWER THAT

01:04:17.353 --> 01:04:18.554
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS NOT?

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:20.189
REQUIRED TO KEEP THE LIGHTS ON

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.158
BUT RATHER TO MEET OUR CLEAN

01:04:22.225 --> 01:04:24.060

01:12:38.287 --> 01:12:39.922
YOU THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:41.457
TO SOLVE YOUR CONCERN WITH WE

01:12:41.523 --> 01:12:42.825
BEGAN.

01:12:42.891 --> 01:12:44.526
BY ADDRESSING THE THAT THE

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.061
AUTHORS STATEMENT ABOUT THE

01:12:46.128 --> 01:12:47.062
PURPOSE OF THE BILL BEING A

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.797
BACKSTOP FUNCTION -- FOR

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.532
RELIABILITY AND PROVIDE

01:12:50.599 --> 01:12:52.067
AMENDMENTS TO THAT EFFECT --

01:12:52.134 --> 01:12:53.936
THAT WOULD NARROW THE BILL TO

01:12:54.002 --> 01:12:55.304
DOING THAT AS OPPOSED TO DOING

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:57.139
LONG RANGE ENERGY PROCUREMENT

01:12:57.206 --> 01:12:59.007
PLANNING ON BEING AND PURCHASING

01:12:59.074 --> 01:13:00.242
ON BEHALF OF ALL.

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:02.578
ELECTRIC PROVIDERS -- WE ALSO

01:13:02.644 --> 01:13:04.046
PROVIDED AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD

01:13:04.113 --> 01:13:05.547
MAKE SURE THAT THE CHARGES

01:13:05.614 --> 01:13:07.549
ASSOCIATED WITH ANY CENTRAL --

01:13:07.616 --> 01:13:10.085
BUYER FLOW TO THE GENERATION

01:13:10.152 --> 01:13:13.188
SIDE OF THE BILL -- AND WE ALSO

01:13:13.255 --> 01:13:14.790
PROVIDE AMENDMENTS WHICH WE NOW

01:13:14.857 --> 01:13:15.457
SEE IN THE COMMITTEE

01:13:15.524 --> 01:13:16.458
RECOMMENDATIONS SO WE APPRECIATE

01:13:16.525 --> 01:13:19.261
THIS THAT IT BE CLEARER THE CCA

01:13:19.328 --> 01:13:21.096
HAVE THE RIGHT -- TO SELF

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:23.966
PROVIDE AND AND SO THOSE OF THE

01:13:24.032 --> 01:13:25.134
THE THE PRIMARY AMENDMENTS THAT

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:27.903
WE WERE ADDRESSING -- AS THE

01:13:27.970 --> 01:13:29.505
BILL IT BECAME MORE OBVIOUS THAT

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:31.940
THE BILL WAS A VEHICLE TO DEAL

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:33.375
WITH EITHER A SAN DIEGO GAS

01:13:33.442 --> 01:13:34.676
ELECTRIC WISHING TO EXIT FROM

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.779
GENERATION OR RESTRUCTURING OF

01:13:36.845 --> 01:13:39.414
THE P. GINNY -- WE ESSENTIALLY

01:13:39.481 --> 01:13:41.316
SAID WELL HOW DO YOU NOT APPLY

01:13:41.383 --> 01:13:43.318
THE SAME STANDARD FOR LONG RANGE

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:44.787
PLANNING OF A UTILITY WHICH IS

01:13:44.853 --> 01:13:47.523
NECESSARY FOR POWER PURCHASES.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:49.191
TO SCCA WHICH ALREADY HAS A LONG

01:13:49.258 --> 01:13:51.794
RANGE PLANNING BODY WHICH IS

01:13:51.860 --> 01:13:52.427
IT'S GOVERNMENT.

01:13:52.494 --> 01:13:53.061
ENTITY.

01:13:53.128 --> 01:13:55.164
AND AND SO ESSENTIALLY THIS BILL

01:13:55.230 --> 01:13:57.332
IS APPLYING A STANDARD IT IT'S

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:58.033
DOING TWO THINGS IT'S DOING

01:13:58.100 --> 01:13:59.401
BACKSTOP RETIREMENT AND IT'S

01:13:59.468 --> 01:14:01.103
ALSO DOING LONG RANGE PLANNING

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:05.374
AND PROCUREMENT.

01:14:05.440 --> 01:14:06.308
AND THOSE TWO THINGS.

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:06.942
ARE DIFFICULT TO PUT INTO ONE

01:14:07.009 --> 01:14:07.476
BILL AND HAVE IT APPLY TO

01:14:07.543 --> 01:14:09.244
EVERYONE IN THE SAME WAY BECAUSE

01:14:09.311 --> 01:14:10.412
CCA'S ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN

01:14:10.479 --> 01:14:11.780
FOR PROFIT UTILITIES -- WE

01:14:11.847 --> 01:14:13.715
ALREADY HAVE RATE PAYERS WHO

01:14:13.782 --> 01:14:16.185
APPROVE OUR PROCUREMENT -- PART

01:14:16.251 --> 01:14:17.452
WERE OWNED BY RATE PAYERS ARE

01:14:17.519 --> 01:14:18.921
BOARD IS ELECTED BY RATE PAYERS

01:14:18.987 --> 01:14:20.455
AND ARE IN A GREAT RESOURCE PLAN

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:21.857
IS PRIMARILY APPROVED BY THE

01:14:21.924 --> 01:14:23.892
GOVERNING BODY -- IT GOES TO THE

01:14:23.959 --> 01:14:27.830
CBC FOR INFORMATION SHARING AND

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:28.497
FOR A COMPLIANCE CHECK THAT IT'S

01:14:28.564 --> 01:14:30.365
COMPLETE -- BUT IT DOESN'T GO

01:14:30.432 --> 01:14:32.768
THERE -- TO SEE IF -- WE'VE

01:14:32.835 --> 01:14:35.204
PROCURED EXACTLY WHAT THE PC

01:14:35.270 --> 01:14:36.805
WANTS US TO PREPARE YOU KNOW

01:14:36.872 --> 01:14:39.174
EIGHT YEARS OUT -- SO I THINK --

01:14:39.241 --> 01:14:41.276
I THINK THAT'S THE THE PRIMARY

01:14:41.343 --> 01:14:41.910
CONCERN.

01:14:41.977 --> 01:14:44.446
IF I MAKE SENATOR AND THAT I

01:14:44.513 --> 01:14:45.347
JUST TO CORRECT SOMETHING THAT

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:46.648
WAS JUST STATED IT WAS OUR

01:14:46.715 --> 01:14:47.616
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INTENT OF

01:14:47.683 --> 01:14:48.784
THIS BUT WAS NEVER TO BE JUST

01:14:48.851 --> 01:14:50.919
ABOUT RELIABILITY WAS ALSO ABOUT

01:14:50.986 --> 01:14:51.954
ENSURING.

01:14:52.020 --> 01:14:53.055
THAT THE STATE HAD THE TOOLS TO

01:14:53.121 --> 01:14:54.156
ENSURING THAT THE CLEAN ENERGY

01:14:54.223 --> 01:14:55.490
TARGET WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:57.226
SAY HI MANY OF OUR PARTNERS

01:14:57.292 --> 01:14:58.794
FIRMLY BELIEVE IS VERY CRITICAL.

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:01.029
WE THINK THAT THIS BILL SO I

01:15:01.096 --> 01:15:02.297
JUST WANT TO SAY AS WELL THAT I

01:15:02.364 --> 01:15:03.799
BELIEVE THE CCA'S HAVEN'T MET

01:15:03.866 --> 01:15:05.334
WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- SINCE

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:06.735
THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR VOTE AND

01:15:06.802 --> 01:15:08.103
THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE

01:15:08.170 --> 01:15:09.238
REALLY BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO

01:15:09.304 --> 01:15:11.139
HAVING HOW DO WE RECTIFY WHAT'S

01:15:11.206 --> 01:15:12.441
IN THE BILL AND WHAT THEIR SCENE

01:15:12.507 --> 01:15:13.976
IS WRONG WITH THE BILL WITH WHAT

01:15:14.042 --> 01:15:15.477
CAN HAPPEN WITH THE BELL WHAT WE

01:15:15.544 --> 01:15:16.945
THINK IS IMPORTANT WHICH IS AT

01:15:17.012 --> 01:15:17.512
THE STATE.

01:15:17.579 --> 01:15:18.847
HAVE A STRONG BACK UP BOTH FOR

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:20.015
THE RELIABILITY AND FOR THE

01:15:20.082 --> 01:15:21.950
CLEAN ENERGY AND MOVING OUT AWAY

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:26.521
FROM THE I. O. U.'S

01:15:26.588 --> 01:15:27.089
WE DID MEET WITH THE OFFICE

01:15:27.155 --> 01:15:30.325
SINCE THAT BUT SO WELL.

01:15:30.392 --> 01:15:30.993
EARLIER I HEARD THOUGHTS ON NONE

01:15:31.059 --> 01:15:31.960
OF THE AMENDMENTS WERE TAKEN BUT

01:15:32.027 --> 01:15:32.861
I ALSO HEARD THAT.

01:15:32.928 --> 01:15:34.596
THERE AND THE CURRENT SUGGESTED

01:15:34.663 --> 01:15:36.198
AMENDMENT CRAZY IN THE BILL

01:15:36.265 --> 01:15:38.967
CORRECT AND SO -- I JUST HOPE

01:15:39.034 --> 01:15:40.168
THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE A

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:41.870
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FOR ME MY

01:15:41.937 --> 01:15:43.605
CONCERN WAS THAT I KNOW THAT WE

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.908
ARE FOCUSED ON GREAT RELIABILITY

01:15:45.974 --> 01:15:47.042
MAKING SUE THERE'S ANOTHER BACK

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.377
WITH BANKRUPTCY WE HAVE THE

01:15:48.443 --> 01:15:50.646
ABILITY. TO TO HANDLE SOMETHING

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.214
OF THAT MAGNITUDE AND I KNOW

01:15:52.281 --> 01:15:52.948
THAT.

01:15:53.015 --> 01:15:55.817
THE MAJOR PLAYERS IN MY PERSONAL

01:15:55.884 --> 01:15:57.019
OPINION IS P. JEANNIE WILL WHO

01:15:57.085 --> 01:15:58.854
IS IN BANKRUPTCY BUT THEN WE

01:15:58.921 --> 01:16:01.256
HAVE SEND HICKEL WHO IS HAS BEEN

01:16:01.323 --> 01:16:02.791
VERY VOCAL ABOUT JUST STEPPING

01:16:02.858 --> 01:16:04.660
AWAY FROM PROCUREMENT.

01:16:04.726 --> 01:16:07.729
AND THEN WE HAVE THE THIRD.

01:16:07.796 --> 01:16:10.332
ONE IN MY OPINION WHICH IS -- I

01:16:10.399 --> 01:16:10.999
THOUGHT COUNT MEDICINE WHO

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.434
HAPPENS TO BE MY DISTRICT AND SO

01:16:12.501 --> 01:16:14.169
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:14.703
WE'RE TAKING.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:16.405
THAT INTO CONSIDERATION WE HAVE

01:16:16.471 --> 01:16:17.673
ONE IN BANKRUPTCY THE OTHER ONE

01:16:17.739 --> 01:16:19.041
WHO DOESN'T WANT TO FOR CARE AND

01:16:19.107 --> 01:16:20.075
THEN WE HAVE THAT.

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:22.244
PERSON IN THE MIDDLE SO I'M VERY

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:24.046

TO ME AND WORKING THROUGH SOME

01:16:28.650 --> 01:16:30.285
OF THESE ISSUES I I WANT TO BE

01:16:30.352 --> 01:16:31.820
SUPPORTIVE BUT I WANT TO MAKE

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:34.056
SURE THAT THERE IS CONVERSATIONS.

01:16:34.122 --> 01:16:35.924
MOVING FORWARD IN TRYING TO AT

01:16:35.991 --> 01:16:37.926
LEAST YOU KNOW SELL SOME OF

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:40.729
THESE CONCERNS OUT HERE -- BUT

01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:43.198
WITH THAT I GUESS I JUST WANT A

01:16:43.265 --> 01:16:45.500
CLARIFICATION THANK YOU.

01:16:48.370 --> 01:16:50.505
LATE MISSING MOST THE TESTIMONY

01:16:50.572 --> 01:16:53.208
I'VE READ -- YOU KNOW THE

01:16:53.275 --> 01:16:55.610
ANALYSIS -- I GUESS IS SOMEBODY

01:16:55.677 --> 01:16:57.179
THAT'S BEEN SUPPORTIVE OF OF

01:16:57.245 --> 01:16:58.480
THIS TYPE OF BILL RESOURCE

01:16:58.547 --> 01:17:00.382
ADEQUACY THINK IT'S INCREDIBLY

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:01.216
IMPORTANT.

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:04.753
MUCH TO THE CHAGRIN OF THE CCA'S --

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:08.156
IN MY DISTRICT -- I LOOK AT THIS

01:17:08.223 --> 01:17:09.758
IN -- BUT I DO HAVE.

01:17:09.825 --> 01:17:11.827
SOME SERIOUS CONCERNS ID

01:17:11.893 --> 01:17:13.462
CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY WE

01:17:13.528 --> 01:17:14.930
SHOULD BE PLANNING A LOOKING OUT

01:17:14.997 --> 01:17:16.131
AHEAD.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:18.567
OF FOR RESOURCES BUT I'M REALLY

01:17:18.633 --> 01:17:20.702
CONFUSED WE WE'VE HAD SEX LAST

01:17:20.769 --> 01:17:23.138
NIGHT MR GARCIA YOU AND I TOO

01:17:23.205 --> 01:17:27.576
LATE IN THE EVENING ACTUALLY BUT

01:17:27.642 --> 01:17:29.911
NEVERTHELESS IT'S THE IDEA THAT

01:17:29.978 --> 01:17:31.980
WE WOULDN'T.

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:34.149
THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE OR OR THAT

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:37.085
WE WOULD HAVE THE P. YOU SEE --

01:17:37.152 --> 01:17:39.287
PURCHASING FOR LET'S JUST SAY

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:42.090
CCA'S OR ANYBODY ON CONTRACTS

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.925
TEN YEARS OUT.

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:45.994
YEAH MAYBE.

01:17:46.061 --> 01:17:47.562
I I I I DON'T.

01:17:47.629 --> 01:17:49.164
I THINK THE THIRD SHOULD BE LIKE

01:17:49.231 --> 01:17:52.167
A PROVISION THAT WOULD SAY OKAY

01:17:52.234 --> 01:17:54.269
IN YOUR SEVEN THROUGH TEN WE

01:17:54.336 --> 01:17:57.039
DON'T THINK THAT YOUR DO WITH

01:17:57.105 --> 01:17:58.607
THE WAY THIS THING IS GOING TO

01:17:58.673 --> 01:18:00.742
YOU'RE GOING TO MEET YOUR NEEDS --

01:18:00.809 --> 01:18:02.744
YOU SHOULD GIVE THAT.

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:03.512
THEY SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY

01:18:03.578 --> 01:18:05.313
TO PROCURE.

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.182
THEIR OWN ENERGY INSTEAD OF

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:10.118
HAVING TO BE YOU SEE DO IT AND

01:18:10.185 --> 01:18:12.154
IF I MAY NOT HAVE -- YEAH THIS

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:13.688
EXACTLY CORRECT BUT I DON'T

01:18:13.755 --> 01:18:15.457
THINK THERE'S ENOUGH FLEXIBILITY

01:18:15.524 --> 01:18:17.692
FOR THE CCA'S THE WAY THIS BILL

01:18:17.759 --> 01:18:19.961
READS TODAY.

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:22.898
SENATOR -- BY MAY ON THE

01:18:22.964 --> 01:18:24.099
COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS

01:18:24.166 --> 01:18:26.001
SPECIFICALLY THAT ARE IN THE

01:18:26.068 --> 01:18:28.403
ANALYSIS TODAY -- CROSS

01:18:28.470 --> 01:18:30.472
REFERENCE THE RIGHTS OF CCA'S TO

01:18:30.539 --> 01:18:32.274
SELF PROVIDE THEIR SHARE OF ANY

01:18:32.340 --> 01:18:33.875
IDENTIFIED LONG TERM NEED UNDER

01:18:33.942 --> 01:18:36.711
SECTION FOR FIFTY FOUR POINT.

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:38.146
FIFTY ONE THAT SECTION ALLOWS

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:39.848
CCA'S ONCE IN NEED AS BEEN

01:18:39.915 --> 01:18:43.552
IDENTIFIED TO PROPOSE HOW THEY

01:18:43.618 --> 01:18:44.152
WOULD MEET THEIR SHARE OF THAT

01:18:44.219 --> 01:18:44.920
NEED.

01:18:44.986 --> 01:18:47.055
IF THERE PROPOSAL IS SUFFICIENT

01:18:47.122 --> 01:18:48.490
THEN THE CCA WOULD NOT BE

01:18:48.557 --> 01:18:50.292
RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LONG TERM

01:18:50.358 --> 01:18:51.293
PROCUREMENT THAT IS DONE ON A

01:18:51.359 --> 01:18:53.695
BACKSTOPS BASIS THAT SAID THAT'S

01:18:53.762 --> 01:18:55.330
THE PROPOSAL IN THIS BILL IS TO

01:18:55.397 --> 01:18:56.865
GIVE CCA'S.

01:18:56.932 --> 01:18:58.834
AS THEY HAVE UNDER SECTION FOR

01:18:58.900 --> 01:19:00.335
FIFTY FOUR POINT FIFTY ONE THAT

01:19:00.402 --> 01:19:02.804
RIGHT TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES

01:19:02.871 --> 01:19:04.606
IF THE NEED IS IDENTIFIED IT'S

01:19:04.673 --> 01:19:06.241
ONLY IF THE CCA FAILS TO MEET

01:19:06.308 --> 01:19:07.442
THAT NEED AFTER IT'S BEEN

01:19:07.509 --> 01:19:08.477
IDENTIFIED.

01:19:08.543 --> 01:19:09.811
THAT BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT WOULD

01:19:09.878 --> 01:19:11.113
BE INVOKED AND THAT'S CURRENT

01:19:11.179 --> 01:19:12.714
LAW WE'RE LINKING IT REALLY TO

01:19:12.781 --> 01:19:14.649
THE EXISTING PROCESS WE'RE NOT

01:19:14.716 --> 01:19:17.452
CREATING ANY NEW MANDATES HERE.

01:19:17.519 --> 01:19:20.555
THIS FEATURE CAN I PROCEED

01:19:20.622 --> 01:19:22.791

01:19:24.826 --> 01:19:25.760
YES SO.

01:19:25.827 --> 01:19:26.728
THE PROCESS TODAY DIDN'T WORK

01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:28.396
WERE WERE KIND OF SPLITTING

01:19:28.463 --> 01:19:30.398
HAIRS HERE BECAUSE I OUR P. IS A

01:19:30.465 --> 01:19:32.267
PLANNING PROCESS THAT'S USED

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:33.835
TODAY AND IT IS USED FOR

01:19:33.902 --> 01:19:35.804
PROCUREMENT BASIS FOR I'LL USE

01:19:35.871 --> 01:19:37.772
TO DO LONG RANGE OF PROCUREMENT.

01:19:37.839 --> 01:19:39.941
IT'S ALSO USED BY DIRECT ACCESS

01:19:40.008 --> 01:19:41.977
PROVIDERS AND CCA'S TO INFORM

01:19:42.043 --> 01:19:44.613
THE QC THE I SO AND OTHERS ABOUT

01:19:44.679 --> 01:19:46.481
WHAT LONG RANGE -- PROCUREMENT

01:19:46.548 --> 01:19:48.049
THE CCA'S AND DIRECT ACCESS ARE

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.852
DOING AND THERE IS A CHECKPOINT

01:19:50.919 --> 01:19:52.921
THERE WERE THE CPUC CAN SAY WHAT

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.589
YOU'RE DOING IS INSUFFICIENT OR

01:19:54.656 --> 01:19:55.957
YOU NEED TO MAKE A CORRECTION

01:19:56.024 --> 01:19:57.425
YOU NEED TO REFILE YOUR PLAN YOU

01:19:57.492 --> 01:19:58.727
NEED TO GO OUT AND DO ADDITIONAL

01:19:58.793 --> 01:20:01.062
PROCUREMENT -- WHAT HAPPENS AT

01:20:01.129 --> 01:20:02.998
THAT POINT IS THAT YOU SEE ONLY

01:20:03.064 --> 01:20:05.000
HAS THE RIGHT TO ORDER BACKSTOPS

01:20:05.066 --> 01:20:07.369
RETIREMENT FOR THOSE RESOURCES?

01:20:07.435 --> 01:20:08.603
IF THERE IS THE ACTUAL

01:20:08.670 --> 01:20:10.839
COMPLIANCE DEFICIENCY -- THIS

01:20:10.906 --> 01:20:12.107
BILL CHANGES OUT AND SAYS THE I.

01:20:12.174 --> 01:20:13.441
R. P. ITSELF BECOMES A

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:15.777
COMPLIANCE PROCUREMENT DOCUMENTS

01:20:15.844 --> 01:20:17.779
AS OPPOSED TO JUST A PLANNING

01:20:17.846 --> 01:20:18.680
DOCUMENT.

01:20:18.747 --> 01:20:20.515
AND AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE

01:20:20.582 --> 01:20:25.387
HAVE A DISAGREEMENT HERE THE

01:20:25.453 --> 01:20:25.620
STABLE.

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:27.355
THAT.

01:20:27.422 --> 01:20:28.523
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE WHAT

01:20:28.590 --> 01:20:29.658
I'VE HEARD SO I MAY I DON'T KNOW

01:20:29.724 --> 01:20:30.225
HOW HOW YOU GUYS ARE GONNA.

01:20:30.292 --> 01:20:31.793
COME TOGETHER ON THIS BUT THAT

01:20:31.860 --> 01:20:33.395
SEEMS TO BE THE BONE OF

01:20:33.461 --> 01:20:36.765
CONTENTION I NAY -- ACTIVE.

01:20:36.831 --> 01:20:37.632
I REALLY THINK THAT THE LAST

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.100
STATEMENT MISREPRESENTS CURRENT

01:20:39.167 --> 01:20:41.770
LAW -- AND A REVIEW OF THE

01:20:41.836 --> 01:20:43.171
STATUTORY PROVISION THAT I

01:20:43.238 --> 01:20:44.139
MENTIONED WHICH IS PART OF THE

01:20:44.206 --> 01:20:46.308
I. R. P. CODE SECTION FOR FIFTY

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:47.576
FOUR POINT.

01:20:47.642 --> 01:20:49.511
FIFTY ONE DIRECTS THE PC IF IT

01:20:49.578 --> 01:20:52.314
IDENTIFIES A DEFICIT RELATIVE TO

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:53.882
THE PORTFOLIO IS ADOPTED. TO

01:20:53.949 --> 01:20:55.717
ALLOW CCA'S TO SELF PROVIDE

01:20:55.784 --> 01:20:56.985
THEIR SHARE OF ANY IDENTIFIED

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:58.053
NEED AND IF THAT CHAIR OF

01:20:58.119 --> 01:20:59.154
IDENTIFIED NEED IS NOT SELF

01:20:59.221 --> 01:21:00.989
PROVIDED.

01:21:01.056 --> 01:21:02.791
IT DIRECTS THE COMMISSION. TO

01:21:02.857 --> 01:21:04.426
AUTHORIZE THE UTILITIES TO DO

01:21:04.492 --> 01:21:05.961
LONG TERM PROCUREMENT AND TO

01:21:06.027 --> 01:21:06.795
CHARGE ALL CUSTOMERS IN THE

01:21:06.861 --> 01:21:08.897
SYSTEM THAT'S THE LAW AS IT IS

01:21:08.964 --> 01:21:10.999
TODAY AND THE P. C. HAS ALREADY

01:21:11.066 --> 01:21:12.500
BEEN MOVING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT

01:21:12.567 --> 01:21:13.368
THAT PROVISION.

01:21:13.435 --> 01:21:15.003
THIS BILL DOESN'T CHANGE THAT AT

01:21:15.070 --> 01:21:16.805
ALL IT DOESN'T ADD TO IT DOESN'T

01:21:16.871 --> 01:21:18.006
SUBTRACT FROM IT.

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.774
SO I UNDERSTAND THE CCA'S HAVE

01:21:19.841 --> 01:21:21.543
AN IDEOLOGICAL OPPOSITION TO PC

01:21:21.610 --> 01:21:23.411
OVERSIGHT OF THEIR INTEGRATED

01:21:23.478 --> 01:21:25.280
RESOURCE PLANNING PROSPER AUNTS

01:21:25.347 --> 01:21:26.748

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:27.816
THEY'RE PROPOSALS THAT HAVE COME

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:29.184
IN HAVE BEEN REVIEWED BY THE

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:29.918
COMMISSION.

01:21:29.985 --> 01:21:31.319
THEY HAVE BEEN APPROVED REJECTED

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:32.320
MODIFIED THERE IS A WHOLE

01:21:32.387 --> 01:21:34.956
PROCESS UNDER WAY AS WE SPEAK --

01:21:35.023 --> 01:21:36.291
THIS BILL DOESN'T TOUCH THAT

01:21:36.358 --> 01:21:37.959
PROCESS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE

01:21:38.026 --> 01:21:40.395
BRIGHT LINES THAT AS SPONSORS WE

01:21:40.462 --> 01:21:41.029
FELT THIS VERY IMPORTANT IN THIS

01:21:41.096 --> 01:21:41.429
BILL.

01:21:41.496 --> 01:21:42.664
WE'RE NOT GOING TO CHANGE THE

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.065
DETAILS OF THE EXISTING PROGRAMS

01:21:44.132 --> 01:21:45.200
THAT ALREADY HAVE THESE

01:21:45.267 --> 01:21:46.968
MECHANISMS WERE SIMPLY CHANGING

01:21:47.035 --> 01:21:48.303
THE IDENTITY OF THE BACKSTOP

01:21:48.370 --> 01:21:49.504
PROCURE.

01:21:49.571 --> 01:21:50.305
AND RATHER THAN BEING THE

01:21:50.372 --> 01:21:52.574
UTILITY WERE PROPOSING TO HAVE A

01:21:52.641 --> 01:21:55.810
STATE ENTITY BE THAT THAT --

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:58.680
PROCUREMENT ENTITY [inaudible]

01:21:58.747 --> 01:21:59.347
SENATOR [inaudible]

01:21:59.414 --> 01:22:00.682
SKINNER.

01:22:00.749 --> 01:22:01.316
AND THEN WE'LL COME BACK TO THE

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.584
CENTER RUBIO -- THANK YOU MISTER

01:22:02.651 --> 01:22:04.052
CHAIR [inaudible]

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:05.854
I'M.

01:22:05.920 --> 01:22:08.256
JT EFFORT.

01:22:08.323 --> 01:22:10.659
THAT THE AUTHOR IS AN WHAT THE

01:22:10.725 --> 01:22:12.827
INTENTION TO TRY TO NOT TRY BUT

01:22:12.894 --> 01:22:15.263
TO HAVE A BACKSTOP PROCUREMENT

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:15.797
TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GRADE

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:16.698
RELIABILITY.

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.833
AND I'VE MET WITH THE AUTHORIZED

01:22:18.900 --> 01:22:21.703
MET WITH -- SPONSORS -- I STILL

01:22:21.770 --> 01:22:25.674
FEEL LIKE THIS BILL NEEDS -- IT.

01:22:25.740 --> 01:22:27.575
I AM ESPECIALLY CONCERNED ABOUT

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:29.210
OUR TREASURERS LETTER.

01:22:29.277 --> 01:22:32.013
BECAUSE IF WE'RE ASKING THE

01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:33.281
TREASURER'S OFFICE THROUGH CAPE

01:22:33.348 --> 01:22:35.350
DEATH TO PLAY SUCH A SIGNIFICANT

01:22:35.417 --> 01:22:36.184
ROLE.

01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:37.852
IT IT JUST IT SEEMS LIKE THIS

01:22:37.919 --> 01:22:39.254
BILL WOULD BENEFIT FROM BECOMING

01:22:39.321 --> 01:22:41.389
A TO YOUR BILL SO THAT THE WORK

01:22:41.456 --> 01:22:43.425
COULD BE DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:22:43.491 --> 01:22:44.926
WE ARE DOING THIS CORRECTLY AND

01:22:44.993 --> 01:22:46.428
ESPECIALLY GIVEN THAT WE JUST

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:47.462
TOOK.

01:22:47.529 --> 01:22:49.331
VERY SIGNIFICANT ACTION

01:22:49.397 --> 01:22:51.800
AFFECTING OUR UTILITIES -- I

01:22:51.866 --> 01:22:53.068
KNOW THE ASSEMBLY HASN'T YET

01:22:53.134 --> 01:22:54.869
APPROVED THE BILL BUT THE IT'S

01:22:54.936 --> 01:22:56.871
OVER TO THE SET ASSEMBLY NOW.

01:22:56.938 --> 01:22:58.973
THE SENATE IS ALSO GOING TO BE

01:22:59.040 --> 01:23:00.508
LOOKING AT BUDGET COMMITTEE

01:23:00.575 --> 01:23:02.177
TODAY A SECOND BILL.

01:23:02.243 --> 01:23:03.411
NOW WELL THOSE ARE COUCHED

01:23:03.478 --> 01:23:05.814
AROUND WILDFIRE THEY REALLY ARE

01:23:05.880 --> 01:23:07.816
ABOUT STABILITY FOR UTILITIES

01:23:07.882 --> 01:23:09.150
NOW THERE MAY BE THE ARGUMENT

01:23:09.217 --> 01:23:10.251
THAT IT DOESN'T.

01:23:10.318 --> 01:23:11.586
DEAL WITH ENSURING THAT OUR

01:23:11.653 --> 01:23:14.456
UTILITIES CAN PROCURE ADEQUATELY

01:23:14.522 --> 01:23:16.324
BUT I THINK THE STABILITY OF THE

01:23:16.391 --> 01:23:17.592
UTILITIES IS THE THING THAT WE

01:23:17.659 --> 01:23:19.794
FIRST AND FOREMOST HAVE TO DEAL

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:21.563
WITH WHICH WE ARE DEALING WITH.

01:23:21.629 --> 01:23:22.864
AND THEN I THINK IT GIVES US

01:23:22.931 --> 01:23:24.833
SOME TIME TO LOOK AT ALL RIGHT

01:23:24.899 --> 01:23:26.768
WHAT ELSE NOW DO WE NEED. TO

01:23:26.835 --> 01:23:29.137
GIVE OUR GREAT THE RELIABILITY

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:31.506
THAT WE NEED SO I'M NOT READY TO

01:23:31.573 --> 01:23:34.542
VOTE AFFIRMATIVELY FOR THE BILL

01:23:34.609 --> 01:23:35.377
TODAY [inaudible]

01:23:35.443 --> 01:23:38.046

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR.

01:23:39.547 --> 01:23:40.782
OF I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT

01:23:40.849 --> 01:23:43.618
ABOUT THE STATE AGENCY THAT'S

01:23:43.685 --> 01:23:46.221
GOING TO BE CREATED -- IS A NOT

SENATOR SKIN IS CONCERNED THAT --

01:23:51.726 --> 01:23:53.294

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:54.729
ESPECIALLY WITH THEIR SO MANY

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:55.864
INTERSECTIONS IN TERMS OF THE

01:23:55.930 --> 01:23:57.499

01:23:57.565 --> 01:23:59.234
THAT'S HAPPENING BUT IN TERMS OF

01:23:59.300 --> 01:24:00.835
THAT AGENCY I MEAN.

01:24:00.902 --> 01:24:02.937
I WOULD IMAGINE IT NEEDS TIME TO

01:24:03.004 --> 01:24:04.672
BE.

01:24:04.739 --> 01:24:06.274

IT'S ABOUT.

01:29:22.523 --> 01:29:24.325
RELIABILITY I MEAN AND THIS IS

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:25.359
WHAT THIS BILL IN A NUTSHELL IS

01:29:25.426 --> 01:29:27.729
TRYING TO ASSURE THAT WE HAVE --

01:29:27.795 --> 01:29:29.397
POWER WHEN NEEDED AND CURE MADE

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:31.199
BE A LONG TERM OR SHORT TERM IS

01:29:31.265 --> 01:29:33.668
IS CRITICAL AND AGAIN I I WORK

01:29:33.735 --> 01:29:35.436
FOR UTILITY COMPANY DURING THE

01:29:35.503 --> 01:29:36.070
ENERGY CRISIS.

01:29:36.137 --> 01:29:39.907
AND IT WAS DUE TO OUR FAILURE.

01:29:39.974 --> 01:29:41.576
TO PLAN AND PREPARE IS DO WITH

01:29:41.642 --> 01:29:42.443
OUR FELLOW YOUR TO ENTER LONG

01:29:42.510 --> 01:29:43.911
TERM CONTRACTS THAT WE FOUND

01:29:43.978 --> 01:29:46.080
OURSELVES BUYING POWER ON THE

01:29:46.147 --> 01:29:47.048
SPOT MARKET WHEN THE DA AT

01:29:47.115 --> 01:29:49.617
MARKET AND IT LED TO A DISASTER.

01:29:49.684 --> 01:29:50.785
THIS IS ONE OF THE SAFEGUARDS

01:29:50.852 --> 01:29:52.954
IT'S GONNA AVOID US DOING THAT

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:55.156
BY MAKING SURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE

01:29:55.223 --> 01:29:57.558
RESOURCES WHEN NEEDED.

01:29:57.625 --> 01:30:00.294
AND IF YOU'RE POLLS THIS BILL

01:30:00.361 --> 01:30:02.029
THEN YOU'RE OPPOSED.

01:30:02.096 --> 01:30:04.065
TO SYSTEM RELIABILITY AND

01:30:04.132 --> 01:30:04.999
BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT THIS IS ALL

01:30:05.066 --> 01:30:07.201
ABOUT SYSTEM RELIABILITY.

01:30:07.268 --> 01:30:08.636
AND IF YOU'RE POLLS THIS BILL IS

01:30:08.703 --> 01:30:12.640
ABOUT PICKING WINNERS AND LOSERS.

01:30:12.707 --> 01:30:13.207
BUT IF YOU SUPPORT THIS BILL

01:30:13.274 --> 01:30:14.175
IT'S ABOUT WHAT WE ALL SAY WE

01:30:14.242 --> 01:30:16.344
CONCERNED ABOUT A RELIABLE

01:30:16.410 --> 01:30:17.512
SYSTEM AND THAT'S NUMBER.

01:30:17.578 --> 01:30:19.013
ONE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:20.581
BE THE FIFTH LEADING ECONOMY AND

01:30:20.648 --> 01:30:22.583
WE HAVE A SPOTTY ELECTRICAL AND

01:30:22.650 --> 01:30:24.385
UTILITY SYSTEM AND THIS IS ABOUT

01:30:24.452 --> 01:30:26.220
SYSTEM RELIABILITY NOT BE HAPPY

01:30:26.287 --> 01:30:29.557

SUPPORT THIS BILL TODAY.

01:30:38.766 --> 01:30:40.635
BUT I LOOK AT THIS THING AND THE

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.637
IDEA THAT THE TWO OF YOU COULD

01:30:42.703 --> 01:30:45.873
NOT EVEN AGREE OR DON'T.

01:30:45.940 --> 01:30:46.974
HAVE IT IT'S LIKE YOU'RE.

01:30:47.041 --> 01:30:49.644

ON THE R. P..

01:30:50.578 --> 01:30:51.512

01:30:55.416 --> 01:30:56.918
BECAUSE THAT IS.

01:30:56.984 --> 01:30:58.753
REALLY DISCONCERTING TO ME THE

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:00.388
IDEA OF THIS NEW ORGANIZATION OF

01:31:00.454 --> 01:31:02.356
THE TREASURES LETTER.

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:04.025
ALSO REALLY WORRIES ME AND I

01:31:04.091 --> 01:31:05.293
THINK A LOT OF WORK NEEDS TO BE

01:31:05.359 --> 01:31:07.662
DONE I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO

01:31:07.728 --> 01:31:08.729
APPROPRIATIONS.

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:10.498

THIS BILL HAS A LOT OF WORK IN I

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:21.008
DON'T THINK MY OTHER COLLEAGUES

01:31:21.075 --> 01:31:22.176
ARE WRONG.

01:31:22.243 --> 01:31:23.611
IN THEIR POSITION THAT MAYBE

01:31:23.678 --> 01:31:25.213

BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT BUT WHEN IT

COMES TO THE FLOOR TODAY IF

01:31:29.584 --> 01:31:31.018
THESE ARE WORKED OUT.

01:31:31.085 --> 01:31:33.821

01:32:29.610 --> 01:32:31.846
THAT DOESN'T WORK IN AN

01:32:31.913 --> 01:32:33.781
ESSENTIALLY I THINK THE BILL CAN

THINK YOU CAN BE IMPLEMENTED I

01:32:40.121 --> 01:32:41.856

ANYTHING THAT MAY COME UP THAT

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:03.477
DOESN'T MAKE THE BILL

01:33:03.544 --> 01:33:04.645
IMPLEMENTABLE FOR WHATEVER

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:05.813

ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION THERE'S

01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:21.988
NOT BECAUSE THERE'S NOTHING

01:59:22.054 --> 01:59:23.489
COMPLICATED ABOUT WHAT VERIZON

01:59:23.556 --> 01:59:25.925
DID DURING THE SANTA CLARA FIRES.

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:27.527
IN FACT RISING HAS MADE VERY

01:59:27.593 --> 01:59:28.828
CLEAR BUT THEY WERE IN THE WRONG.

01:59:28.895 --> 01:59:30.796
WHAT HAPPENED IN SANTA CLARA IN

01:59:30.863 --> 01:59:31.697
THE MIDDLE OF OUR STATE'S WORST

01:59:31.764 --> 01:59:33.399
FIRE IN HISTORY HAD NOTHING TO

01:59:36.135 --> 01:59:37.436
AND AND NOTHING TO DO WITH

01:59:37.503 --> 01:59:38.905
ANYTHING THAT RESEMBLED THE

01:59:38.971 --> 01:59:40.306
TECHNICAL RATIONALE.

01:59:40.373 --> 01:59:41.741
THERE WERE NO GOOD REASONS FOR

01:59:41.807 --> 01:59:42.441
FIRE DEPARTMENTS BROADBAND

01:59:42.508 --> 01:59:45.011
SERVICE TO BE THROTTLE DOWN TO

01:59:45.077 --> 01:59:45.545
ONE TWO HUNDREDTH OF ITS

01:59:45.611 --> 01:59:46.979
ORIGINAL SPEED IN THE MIDDLE OF

01:59:47.046 --> 01:59:49.081
AN EMERGENCY AND THUS RENDERING

01:59:49.148 --> 01:59:50.616
IT USELESS.

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:51.484
SUCH CONDUCT WOULD HAVE BEEN THE

01:59:51.551 --> 01:59:53.219
LEGAL ADVICE HE'S RISO FEDERALLY

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:54.854
REGULATED COM CARRIERS AS SUCH

01:59:54.921 --> 01:59:56.022
IT AS SUCH AND THESE ARE

01:59:56.088 --> 01:59:57.757
PROHIBITED FROM ENGAGING IN ON

01:59:57.823 --> 01:59:59.325
JUSTIN ON REGIONAL PRACTICES.

01:59:59.392 --> 02:00:00.626
NOW I'M NOT SAYING THE RISE IN

02:00:00.693 --> 02:00:02.361
PLOTTED TO DO HARM OR SCAR

02:00:02.428 --> 02:00:03.763
SCHEME BUT I'M JUST SAYING IS

02:00:03.829 --> 02:00:05.097
THERE'S NO GOVERNMENT ENTITY

02:00:05.164 --> 02:00:07.533
RESPONSIBLE FOR BALANCING OUT --

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:08.634

CRITICAL AND ESSENTIAL SERVICES.

02:00:20.179 --> 02:00:20.980
AND I DON'T SEE ANY TECHNICAL

02:00:21.047 --> 02:00:22.815
REASON WHY WIRELESS CARRIERS ARE

V. THE THE CONSUMERS.

02:40:05.762 --> 02:40:07.564
BUT OF FOR OUR PUBLIC SAFETY

02:40:07.631 --> 02:40:09.099
PERSONNEL THAT ARE WORKING VERY

02:40:09.166 --> 02:40:12.636
HARD. TO BE RESPONSIVE IN CASE

02:40:12.703 --> 02:40:14.504
OF EMERGENCIES AND WE BELIEVE.

02:40:14.571 --> 02:40:15.939
THAT UNLESS WE HAVE ANY OTHER

02:40:16.006 --> 02:40:17.541

A SO FAR.

02:40:32.656 --> 02:40:35.459
AND STILL OF FIND THAT BALANCE

02:40:35.525 --> 02:40:37.127
AS I MENTIONED ON FOR PROVIDING

02:40:37.194 --> 02:40:39.162

ALSO BRINGING OF OVER.

02:40:56.446 --> 02:40:57.481
FORWARD AND ACCEPTING IMMENSE --

02:40:57.547 --> 02:40:58.448
I DID HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO SIT

02:40:58.515 --> 02:40:59.916
DOWN OR AT LEAST TALK VERY

02:40:59.983 --> 02:41:01.518
BRIEFLY WITH COMMISSIONER WAS

WELL AS ALL THE THE WORK -- CW A

02:41:05.856 --> 02:41:08.558
AND I THINK THIS WAS A BILL THAT

02:41:08.625 --> 02:41:10.460
WAS WASN'T EASY BUT I ALSO WANT

02:41:10.527 --> 02:41:12.429
TO COMMEND THE INDUSTRY WHO SAT

02:41:12.496 --> 02:41:14.097
WITH US I HAD A FEW PEOPLE LATE

02:41:14.164 --> 02:41:15.632
LAST NIGHT IN MY OFFICE AND WERE

02:41:15.699 --> 02:41:17.167
WILLING TO COME TO THE TABLE.

02:41:17.234 --> 02:41:19.202
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:41:19.269 --> 02:41:21.271
ALLOW FOR INNOVATION AND GROWTH

02:41:21.338 --> 02:41:23.140
AND BUT AT THE SAME TIME

02:41:23.206 --> 02:41:25.142
CONSUMER PROTECTIONS WAS REALLY

02:41:25.208 --> 02:41:26.810
AT THE HEART OF OUR DISCUSSIONS.

02:41:26.877 --> 02:41:28.612
EVERY SINGLE DAY AND DIE WITH

02:41:28.678 --> 02:41:30.914
ALL THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE

02:41:30.981 --> 02:41:32.182
READ RIGHT HERE I THINK THAT FOR

02:41:32.249 --> 02:41:33.216
NOW IT STRIKES THAT MIDDLE

02:41:33.283 --> 02:41:34.551
GROUND WHERE WERE ABLE TO AT

02:41:34.618 --> 02:41:35.519
LEAST.

02:41:35.585 --> 02:41:37.020
EXTENDED A FEW YEARS SO THAT WE

02:41:37.087 --> 02:41:38.588
CAN CONTINUE IN THE NEXT COUPLE

02:41:38.655 --> 02:41:39.890
OF YEARS MONITOR THE THE

02:41:39.956 --> 02:41:41.625
INDUSTRY AND ENSURE THAT THOSE

02:41:41.691 --> 02:41:43.493

02:41:47.798 --> 02:41:49.299
TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING.

02:41:49.366 --> 02:41:51.902
BY FAST EXPONENTIALLY JUST AND

02:41:51.968 --> 02:41:53.070
SO I THINK WE NEED TO TAKE POTS

02:41:53.136 --> 02:41:54.137
ONCE IN AWHILE TO CHECK IN AND

02:41:54.204 --> 02:41:56.606

ROLE CARILLO YES MAY PLAY.

02:43:44.781 --> 02:43:47.350
IN MAKING SURE THAT.

02:43:47.417 --> 02:43:49.119
THE ENERGY IS ASIAN AND DURING

02:43:49.186 --> 02:43:50.887
WILDFIRES VULNERABLE PEOPLE

02:43:50.954 --> 02:43:53.290
DON'T GET.

02:43:53.356 --> 02:43:55.458
STOCK IS THAT'S A LIFELINE AND

02:43:55.525 --> 02:43:56.459
SO.

02:43:56.526 --> 02:43:57.627
I'M I JUST I GOT TO GET SOME

02:43:57.694 --> 02:43:59.496
REASSURANCE ON THAT AND MAY WE

HOWEVER YOU WANT TO AND I JUST

02:44:02.132 --> 02:44:04.201
WANT TO POINT OUT -- AND THIS

02:44:04.267 --> 02:44:04.768
WAS OUR CONCERN.

02:44:04.834 --> 02:44:06.503
FROM THE LOOK THIS WAS NOT EASY

02:44:06.570 --> 02:44:07.537
BILL FOR ME TO TAKE IN THE FIRST

02:44:07.604 --> 02:44:12.809
PLACE -- I HAVE NEVER.

02:44:12.876 --> 02:44:16.446
THAT MAKES MY LABOR PARTNERS AND

02:44:16.513 --> 02:44:17.781
THE BILL I'VE DONE.

02:44:17.847 --> 02:44:19.749
WHAT I'M HOWEVER?

02:44:19.816 --> 02:44:21.551
WE THINK THAT BY PROVIDING

02:44:21.618 --> 02:44:23.920
EXPLICIT DIRECTIONS SO WITH --

02:44:23.987 --> 02:44:26.990
YES BEING ABLE TO TO MAKE THE

02:44:27.057 --> 02:44:28.825
NINE ONE ONE I'M CHANGES

02:44:28.892 --> 02:44:29.926
ANYTHING TO NINE ONE ONE THAT

02:44:29.993 --> 02:44:30.927
THAT'S GOOD THAT'S A START WHAT

02:44:30.994 --> 02:44:31.361
WE ACTUALLY THINK.

02:44:31.428 --> 02:44:33.163
WE'LL MOVE FASTER THAN IT WOULD

02:44:33.230 --> 02:44:34.531
IF WE LEFT IT UP TO YOU SEE.

02:44:34.598 --> 02:44:36.099
I'M WE ALSO THINK OF COURSE

02:44:36.166 --> 02:44:38.134
WHERE WE'RE NOT GIVING UP THE

02:44:38.201 --> 02:44:41.137
POWER THE LEGISLATURE TO MANDATE

02:44:41.204 --> 02:44:42.639
ANYTHING AND I THINK THAT'S

02:44:42.706 --> 02:44:43.573
IMPORTANT AS WELL.

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:45.242
AND THERE ARE CERTAIN PROVISIONS

02:44:45.308 --> 02:44:46.776
ROUTE THIS BILL THEY THINK WILL

02:44:46.843 --> 02:44:47.911
ACTUALLY MAKE IT.

02:44:47.978 --> 02:44:49.045
I'M MUCH MORE CLEAR FOR

02:44:49.112 --> 02:44:50.914
CONSUMERS THE FACT THAT THEY

02:44:50.981 --> 02:44:52.983
WILL BE TOLD THEIR RIGHTS TO

02:44:53.049 --> 02:44:54.951
HAVE BASIC LINE SERVICE -- WE

02:44:55.018 --> 02:44:55.752
ARE NO WAY MOVING AWAY FROM

02:44:55.819 --> 02:44:57.220
BASIC LINES SERVICE WERE

02:44:57.287 --> 02:44:57.854
ACTUALLY GOING TO MAKE IT MORE

02:44:57.921 --> 02:44:58.521
CLEAR.

02:44:58.588 --> 02:45:00.590
I'M NOT ONLY THAT THEY HAVE THE

02:45:00.657 --> 02:45:01.191
RIGHT TO BASICALLY IN SERVICE

02:45:01.258 --> 02:45:03.059
THAT WITH BOYS IF THEY LOSE

02:45:03.126 --> 02:45:04.227
THEIR POWER THE DATE WITHOUT

02:45:04.294 --> 02:45:05.862
BACKUP GENERATION THEY WILL LOSE

02:45:05.929 --> 02:45:07.464
THEIR TELEPHONE SERVICE.

02:45:07.530 --> 02:45:08.465
SO THAT IS.

02:45:08.531 --> 02:45:10.367
AN ADDITIONAL I THINK CONSUMER

02:45:10.433 --> 02:45:11.935
PROTECTION AND A PROTECTION FOR

02:45:12.002 --> 02:45:13.270
THOSE SPECIALLY WILDFIRE AREAS

02:45:13.336 --> 02:45:15.005
TO UNDERSTAND WE'RE TALKING

02:45:15.071 --> 02:45:17.340
ABOUT PGA OF COURSE TALK ABOUT --

02:45:17.407 --> 02:45:19.309
PLANNED BLACKOUTS ARE IF YOU

02:45:19.376 --> 02:45:22.779
WILL OR OR I I DON'T KNOW WHAT

02:45:22.846 --> 02:45:23.480
ELSE TO COMBAT -- THREE THAT

02:45:23.546 --> 02:45:24.648
THAT CONSUMER SHOULD UNDERSTAND

02:45:24.714 --> 02:45:26.549
THAT MEANS YOUR PHONE WON'T WORK

02:45:26.616 --> 02:45:27.751
UNLESS YOU HAVE BACKUP POWER I'M

02:45:27.817 --> 02:45:28.485
IN AND I THINK THIS BILL

02:45:28.551 --> 02:45:30.654
ACTUALLY DOES THAT EXTENDS THAT

02:45:30.720 --> 02:45:32.856
IN A MUCH QUICKER WAY THAN IF WE

02:45:32.922 --> 02:45:39.863
JUST SIMPLY LEFT IT UP TO THE UC

02:45:39.929 --> 02:45:42.032
TO CREATE SOME -- NEW -- TO CALL

02:45:42.098 --> 02:45:43.233
AND SO -- THOSE ARE THE THINGS

02:45:43.300 --> 02:45:44.167
WERE SEEKING ANSWERS MORE THAT

02:45:44.234 --> 02:45:44.801
YOU WOULD LIKE I'D BE HAPPY TO

02:45:44.868 --> 02:45:45.402
WORK ITH YOU IS THIS MISS FORD

02:45:45.468 --> 02:45:46.036
WE'VE BEEN ASKING ALONG THE WAY

02:45:46.102 --> 02:45:46.903
WHAT ELSE IS IT BECAUSE WHAT

02:45:46.970 --> 02:45:47.504
WE'RE SAYING IS NOT.

02:45:47.570 --> 02:45:48.138
THAT THEY SHOULD GO ON REGULATED

02:45:48.204 --> 02:45:49.039
WE'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:45:49.105 --> 02:45:50.206
DOING THE REGULATION SO THIS

02:45:50.273 --> 02:45:51.074
ACTUALLY GETS PUT IN PLACE IN

02:45:51.141 --> 02:45:52.342
ENOUGH TIME TO AFFECT THOSE

02:45:52.409 --> 02:45:54.277
CONSUMERS THAT WE KNOW -- NEED

02:45:54.344 --> 02:45:55.412
TO BE EFFECTIVE NOW I'M REALLY

02:45:55.478 --> 02:45:56.946
EXCITED ABOUT THE SEVENTY TWO

02:45:57.013 --> 02:45:58.682
HOUR RESTORATION -- SERVICE THAT

02:45:58.748 --> 02:46:00.083
WAS ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I

02:46:00.150 --> 02:46:01.451
ASKED FOR BECAUSE THAT THAT

02:46:01.518 --> 02:46:03.153
THAT'S ONE OF THINGS LACKING

02:46:03.219 --> 02:46:04.854
WITH WITH -- VOICE OF COURSE YOU

02:46:04.921 --> 02:46:05.789
KNOW WITH YOUR LAND LINE YOU

02:46:05.855 --> 02:46:07.357
HAVE SOME SOME PROVISIONS THAT

02:46:07.424 --> 02:46:09.025
THAT ENSURE YOU'RE GOING TO GET

02:46:09.092 --> 02:46:10.393
YOUR LAND LINE BACK IF IT GETS

DOING OUR PROPER ROLE I THINK IT

02:46:25.508 --> 02:46:27.977
LEGISLATING THESE THINGS INTO --

02:46:28.044 --> 02:46:29.179
INTO EXISTENCE RATHER THAN

02:46:29.245 --> 02:46:30.246
WAITING FOR THE REGULATORY

02:46:30.313 --> 02:46:31.948

02:46:41.124 --> 02:46:42.926
WE'RE HOPING IF THERE'S MORE AS

02:46:42.992 --> 02:46:44.728
YOU GO THROUGH IT IN AS THIS

02:46:44.794 --> 02:46:47.197
GOES HOPEFULLY TOOK RELATIONS.

02:46:47.263 --> 02:46:52.202

THEY'VE REVIEWED THE A MAN'S OR

02:46:57.374 --> 02:46:58.308

CUSTOMERS THAT THEY'RE THEY

02:47:04.080 --> 02:47:04.414
COULD LOSE POWER.

02:47:04.481 --> 02:47:05.782

TELCOS TO TELL THE CONSUMERS

02:47:24.100 --> 02:47:26.169

IN THAT.

02:48:48.218 --> 02:48:49.752
THIS IS A VERY BASIC

02:48:49.819 --> 02:48:52.288

I'M HERE I WILL WORK ON ANY

02:49:13.443 --> 02:49:14.878
ISSUE -- I I THINK.

02:49:14.944 --> 02:49:16.212
IN I MEAN WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

02:49:16.279 --> 02:49:18.047
COMMISSIONER IT'S AT WE JUST

02:49:18.114 --> 02:49:20.383
WANT TO ENSURE THAT WHAT WE DO

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:21.784
GETS DONE IT GETS DONE NOW IF

02:49:21.851 --> 02:49:23.786
THAT MAKES SENSE -- AND AND I

02:49:23.853 --> 02:49:25.088
YOU KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO WORK

02:49:25.154 --> 02:49:26.356
ON THESE FOR WHATEVER'S

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:27.857
NECESSARY.

02:49:27.924 --> 02:49:30.293
I I REALLY -- PREFERRED I HAD

02:49:30.360 --> 02:49:32.529
THE WELL I CAN SEE WHY YOU NEED

02:49:32.595 --> 02:49:34.197
BACK UP POWER AS WELL BUT I

02:49:34.264 --> 02:49:35.331
THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT.

02:49:35.398 --> 02:49:36.366
I'M YOUR CONSTITUENTS AND

02:49:36.432 --> 02:49:39.402
CONSTITUENTS IT LIVE IN AN AREA

02:49:39.469 --> 02:49:40.270
THAT IS.

02:49:40.336 --> 02:49:40.803
SUBJECT ALL THESE THINGS

02:49:40.870 --> 02:49:42.705
UNDERSTAND THAT THEY STILL HAVE

02:49:42.772 --> 02:49:43.973
A RIGHT TO BASIC SERVICE AND WHY

02:49:44.040 --> 02:49:45.742
THAT THAT RIGHT IS SO IMPORTANT --

02:49:45.808 --> 02:49:47.210
IN WHICH CASE IF THEY BASIC

02:49:47.277 --> 02:49:48.511
SERVICE IT GETS BACK TO BEING

02:49:48.578 --> 02:49:50.847
REGULATED OF COURSE -- BY THE PC

02:49:50.914 --> 02:49:54.083
SO PART OF MY GOAL I THINK AND

02:49:54.150 --> 02:49:56.853
ACCEPT DEAN -- THIS BILL TO TAKE

02:49:56.920 --> 02:49:59.989
IT ON INTO AYE. TO EXTEND THE

02:50:00.056 --> 02:50:02.358
SUNSET -- WIT WHICH IT IT'S NOT

02:50:02.425 --> 02:50:04.294
A BILL I USUALLY WOULD DO IS TO

02:50:04.360 --> 02:50:06.963
ENSURE THAT -- ON A VARIETY OF

02:50:07.030 --> 02:50:08.898
GROUNDS I THINK IT'S IT'S M..

02:50:08.965 --> 02:50:10.366
A CHANGE OF PACE OF HOW WE'VE

02:50:10.433 --> 02:50:11.968
SEEN THE COMPANIES GO AWAY FROM

02:50:12.035 --> 02:50:14.404
BASIC SERVICE IN -- MAYBE AT AN

02:50:14.470 --> 02:50:15.772
UNDERSTANDING OF A NEW WORLD

02:50:15.838 --> 02:50:17.907
WHERE CONSUMERS MADE ME THAT

02:50:17.974 --> 02:50:19.742
EXPLANATION OF WHY THAT WOULD BE

02:50:19.809 --> 02:50:21.578
SO IMPORTANT FOR THEM IN CERTAIN

02:50:21.644 --> 02:50:23.012
AREAS OF THE STATE.

02:50:23.079 --> 02:50:24.514
TO UTILIZE THAT BASIC SERVICE

02:50:24.581 --> 02:50:26.950
RATHER THAN RELYING ON ON VOIGTS

02:50:27.016 --> 02:50:28.618
FURTHER ON SERVICE.

02:50:28.685 --> 02:50:30.353
SO ALL I WOULD JUST ASK FOR FOR

02:50:30.420 --> 02:50:31.521
MEDIA COME THROUGH THE VOTE

02:50:31.588 --> 02:50:32.956

GENERAL SO THERE THERE'S A

02:51:14.697 --> 02:51:16.065
NUMBER OF PLACES I THINK WE

02:51:16.132 --> 02:51:19.535

FEEL LIKE THEY'RE BEING SERVICE.

02:51:35.418 --> 02:51:36.686
AND THAT IS AN ISSUE THAT WE

02:51:36.753 --> 02:51:37.987
CONTINUE TO WORK ON IN THIS

02:51:38.054 --> 02:51:39.155
LEGISLATIVE BODY THERE'S BEEN A

02:51:39.222 --> 02:51:40.323

02:52:15.658 --> 02:52:17.193
GUARANTEE IS THERE THAT IT'S

02:52:17.260 --> 02:52:18.928
SOLID AND THERE'S NO LOOPHOLES

02:52:18.995 --> 02:52:20.096
BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S BEEN A

02:52:20.163 --> 02:52:20.596
CONCERN.

02:52:20.663 --> 02:52:21.597
FOR SOME ODD CONSUMERS AS WELL

02:52:21.664 --> 02:52:25.101

02:52:27.203 --> 02:52:27.737
AND YOU CAN SURE THAT THIS IS

02:52:27.804 --> 02:52:28.304
WHAT TO HAVE IT'S DEFINITELY

02:52:28.371 --> 02:52:29.038
BETTER THAN THE CURRENT LAW SO

02:52:29.105 --> 02:52:29.872
THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR US

02:52:29.939 --> 02:52:32.442
RATE OF SERVICES CURRENTLY WE

02:52:50.093 --> 02:52:51.294
DIFFERENCES IN THE TYPE IN AND

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:51.494

CALIFORNIA ALSO.

02:53:44.213 --> 02:53:45.248
SEE TO BE A DESERVE NINE AND AND

02:53:45.314 --> 02:53:46.682
TURN ON THE RESTORATION IN THE

02:53:46.749 --> 02:53:48.551
REVIEW OF THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE

02:53:48.618 --> 02:53:50.419
SAW -- THIS MORNING OR THIS

02:53:50.486 --> 02:53:52.522
AFTERNOON -- IT IS IMPORTANT

02:53:52.588 --> 02:53:54.490
NOTICE THAT THERE IS LANGUAGE IN

02:53:54.557 --> 02:53:55.057
THERE THAT APPEARS TO BE AN

02:53:55.124 --> 02:53:59.028
EXEMPTION -- FORM THE THE TWENTY

02:53:59.095 --> 02:54:00.296
FOUR HOUR NOTICE AND SEE TWO

02:54:00.363 --> 02:54:01.831
HOURS OF RESTORING SERVICE --

02:54:01.898 --> 02:54:03.466
WHAT IT STATES IS THAT IF THE

02:54:03.533 --> 02:54:05.067
QUOTE PROVIDER IS ALREADY

02:54:05.134 --> 02:54:07.970
SUBJECT TO A RESTORATION REQUIRE

02:54:08.037 --> 02:54:10.139
THAT REQUIREMENT IS SIMILAR OR

02:54:10.206 --> 02:54:10.940
THE SAME?

02:54:11.007 --> 02:54:13.075
THEN THE REQUIREMENTS IN THIS

02:54:13.142 --> 02:54:14.443
BILL DON'T APPLY.

02:54:14.510 --> 02:54:15.878
THAT COULD BE READ TO MEAN THAT

02:54:15.945 --> 02:54:17.246
A PROVIDER LIKE EIGHTEEN T.

02:54:17.313 --> 02:54:18.548
WHICH IS ALREADY SUBJECT TO

02:54:18.614 --> 02:54:20.483
RESTORATION FOR ITS COPPER LAND

02:54:20.550 --> 02:54:21.751
LINES WOULDN'T THEN NOT BE

02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:22.819
SUBJECT.

02:54:22.885 --> 02:54:24.287
TO THIS LANGUAGE IT DOES NOT SAY

02:54:24.353 --> 02:54:25.721
THAT THE STRONGER STANDARD

02:54:25.788 --> 02:54:27.490
APPLIES.

02:54:27.557 --> 02:54:28.191
BOARD SAY THAT THE STANDARD

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:30.026
APPLIES OF TECHNOLOGY SO WE

02:54:30.092 --> 02:54:31.794
THINK THAT COULD ACTUALY BE A

02:54:31.861 --> 02:54:34.030
PRETTY WIDE EXEMPTION FROM WHAT

02:54:34.096 --> 02:54:35.865
WE THINK THE WHAT ARE INNER SENS

02:54:35.932 --> 02:54:37.633
WHAT THE AUTHOR INTENDS. TO FOR

02:54:37.700 --> 02:54:40.102
THAT TO APPLY WITHOUT EXEMPTION

02:54:40.169 --> 02:54:41.671
SIMPLY BECAUSE EIGHTEEN T.

02:54:41.737 --> 02:54:45.842
ALREADY HAS A REQUIREMENT FOR

02:54:45.908 --> 02:54:47.810
COPPER LAND LINE -- WE'RE NOT

ACTUALLY BEING APPLICABLES

02:54:52.982 --> 02:54:53.349
EIGHTEEN T..

02:54:53.416 --> 02:54:54.083
I THINK THAT'S MORE OF A

02:54:54.150 --> 02:54:55.318
DRAFTING ARE THAT WE'RE HAPPY --

02:54:55.384 --> 02:54:57.520
TO CONFIRM THAT THAT WAS NOT OUR

02:54:57.587 --> 02:54:58.354
INTENTION SEVEN IT'S NOT AND IT

02:54:58.421 --> 02:55:00.790

CHOSE TO CARRY THIS.

02:55:48.738 --> 02:55:49.739
LEGISLATION.

02:55:49.805 --> 02:55:51.040
WHEN I WAS IN ASSEMBLY WITH THE

02:55:51.107 --> 02:55:52.074
UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS A

02:55:52.141 --> 02:55:53.643
NEW TECHNOLOGY AND WE WANTED

02:55:53.709 --> 02:55:55.544
THIS TECHNOLOGY TO OF ALL?

02:55:55.611 --> 02:55:57.513
IN TAKE HOLD ANY PASS.

02:55:57.580 --> 02:55:59.682
BUT 'M ALSO CONCERNED AS I

02:55:59.749 --> 02:56:01.651
HEARD FROM CW A ABOUT.

02:56:01.717 --> 02:56:03.286
INFRASTRUCTURE AND MAINTAINING

02:56:03.352 --> 02:56:04.954
INFRASTRUCTURE IN A LOT OF TIMES

02:56:05.021 --> 02:56:06.155
WE ARE.

02:56:06.222 --> 02:56:08.491
ARE MISLED AT AS TO BELIEVE THAT

02:56:08.557 --> 02:56:10.393
FIBER JUST BECAUSE WE PUT FIBER

02:56:10.459 --> 02:56:12.194
WE CAN ABANDON THE COPPER AND

02:56:12.261 --> 02:56:13.562
THEY HAVE CLEARLY ABANDONED

02:56:13.629 --> 02:56:15.231
COPPER I STILL HAVE A LAND LINE

02:56:15.298 --> 02:56:16.499
IN MY HOME TODAY.

02:56:16.565 --> 02:56:17.767
I WILL AWAYS HAVE A LAND LINE

02:56:17.833 --> 02:56:18.968
BUT EVERY TIME I GO OFF LOOK I

02:56:19.035 --> 02:56:21.304
HAVE NOTHING BUT STATIC.

02:56:21.370 --> 02:56:22.405
ON MY LINE.

02:56:22.471 --> 02:56:23.606
BUT AT THE SAME TIME THIS COPPER

02:56:23.673 --> 02:56:26.342
STEEL THE BACKBONE FOR VOICE IN

02:56:26.409 --> 02:56:26.709
ORDER TO WORK.

02:56:26.776 --> 02:56:28.744
STILL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THIS

02:56:28.811 --> 02:56:31.247
INFRASTRUCTURE IS NOT ONLY

02:56:31.314 --> 02:56:33.883
MAINTAINED BUT IT RESPONDED

02:56:33.950 --> 02:56:35.184
QUICKLY -- YOU KNOW TO SERVICE

02:56:35.251 --> 02:56:38.754
OUTAGES WE SAW WHAT HAPPENED IN

02:56:38.821 --> 02:56:39.355
TWO THOUSAND TEN WITH THE BAT

02:56:39.422 --> 02:56:39.789
RAINS.

02:56:39.855 --> 02:56:41.390
IN CALIFORNIA WHERE WE SAW

02:56:41.457 --> 02:56:41.924
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

02:56:41.991 --> 02:56:44.760
CUSTOMERS THROUGHOUT -- WITHOUT

02:56:44.827 --> 02:56:47.596
SERVICE FOR DAYS IN OUT AND YOU

02:56:47.663 --> 02:56:49.865
WITHOUT SERVICE FOR SOME AS MUCH

02:56:49.932 --> 02:56:50.299
AS A WEEK.

02:56:50.366 --> 02:56:52.902
MY CONCERN IS THAT IF IT'S NOT

02:56:52.969 --> 02:56:54.670
TO PAY YOU SEE AND THAT FOR

02:56:54.737 --> 02:56:56.505
OVERSIGHT WHAT AGENCY SHOULD

02:56:56.572 --> 02:56:57.640
THAT BE I DON'T NECESSARY

02:56:57.707 --> 02:56:58.541
BELIEVE IT SHOULD BE THE

02:56:58.607 --> 02:57:00.242
LEGISLATURE BECAUSE AS YOU SAY

02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:01.711
THE AVERAGE CONSUMER DOESN'T

02:57:01.777 --> 02:57:02.912
KNOW HOW TO PICK UP THE PHONE

02:57:02.979 --> 02:57:04.413
AND CALL THE P. YOU SEE.

02:57:04.480 --> 02:57:05.548
THERE SURELY NOT CALLING THEIR

02:57:05.614 --> 02:57:07.216
LEGISLATOR WHEN THEY SAY MY

02:57:07.283 --> 02:57:09.819
PHONE SERVICE IS NOT WORKING SO.

02:57:09.885 --> 02:57:12.388
WHO SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIVE TO

02:57:12.455 --> 02:57:15.358
THE CUSTOMER IF IN FACT THERE IS

02:57:15.424 --> 02:57:17.827
AN OUTAGE AND I I THINK THAT'S

02:57:17.893 --> 02:57:19.495
IMPORTANT SERVICE RELIABILITY IS

02:57:19.562 --> 02:57:20.763
CRITICALLY IMPORTANT?

02:57:20.830 --> 02:57:24.233
AND AGAIN IT'S I KNOW A LOT OF

02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:25.968
OUR RESIDENTS WILL NEVER OUT OF

02:57:26.035 --> 02:57:27.403
WHITE BUT I KNOW A LOT OF FOLKS.

02:57:27.470 --> 02:57:28.838
HAVE WAY BECAUSE YOU'RE MY

02:57:28.904 --> 02:57:30.973
GRADING BECAUSE OF GANT WERE NOT

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.174
MAINTAINING THE COPPER.

02:57:32.241 --> 02:57:34.110
WIRE SO IT'S ALMOST A FORCED

02:57:34.176 --> 02:57:36.112
MIGRATION TO AVOID.

02:57:36.178 --> 02:57:37.813
SO HOW DO YOU RESPOND.

02:57:37.880 --> 02:57:39.048
WELL THE ENFORCEMENT AGENCY IS

02:57:39.115 --> 02:57:41.250
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN THIS SO

02:57:41.317 --> 02:57:42.918
THEY WILL BE.

02:57:42.985 --> 02:57:44.587
I I KNOW THAT THE ADDING A LOT

02:57:44.653 --> 02:57:47.023
OF WE WOULD IF THEY WOULD HAVE

02:57:47.089 --> 02:57:48.257
THEY COULD STILL REPORTED TO THE

02:57:48.324 --> 02:57:51.694
UC AND UC WILL REPORTED TO THE

02:57:51.761 --> 02:57:53.129
AG YOU IS IMPORTANT MECHANISM.

TAKEN A LOT OF AMENDMENTS THAT

02:57:56.632 --> 02:57:57.733
HAVE BROUGHT.

02:57:57.800 --> 02:57:59.568
ME A LITTLE CLOSER TO BEING

02:57:59.635 --> 02:58:01.337
SUPPORTIVE OF THIS AGAIN MY

02:58:01.404 --> 02:58:03.539
CONCERN IS THE INTERSTATE CALLS

AS IT RELATES TO OUR OUR FOLKS

02:58:06.909 --> 02:58:08.044
SURE INMATES HOW DO WE ADDRESS

02:58:08.110 --> 02:58:09.145
THAT BECAUSE THAT WAS NOT

02:58:09.211 --> 02:58:09.912
ADDRESS AND I WAS ONE OF MY

02:58:09.979 --> 02:58:11.447
CONCERNS AND I THINK IF WE'RE

02:58:11.514 --> 02:58:12.715
TALKING ABOUT RATES WERE.

02:58:12.782 --> 02:58:13.215
TALKING ABOUT CONSUMER

PROTECTIONS WHY SHOULD WE

02:58:15.084 --> 02:58:16.819
PROTECT PRE PROTECT THOSE FOLKS

02:58:16.886 --> 02:58:18.687
