WHICH ADDRESSES AN IMPORTANT

00:32:34.953 --> 00:32:38.056 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT ELEAZAR LOCAL

00:32:36.755 --> 00:32:39.391 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES ARE

00:32:38.056 --> 00:32:40.992 region:rollup2

BACK TO TWO THOUSAND SEVEN

00:32:49.968 --> 00:32:53.171 region:rollup2

WHICH YOU CAN IMAGINE I WASN'T

00:32:53.171 --> 00:32:56.608 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT TWO THOUSAND SEVEN IS

00:32:54.573 --> 00:32:58.076 region:rollup2
NOT SUFFICIENT FOR OUR

00:32:56.608 --> 00:33:00.045 region:rollup2
EXPENDITURES NOW.

00:32:58.076 --> 00:33:01.546 region:rollup2
OR ONE OF THOSE EXPENDITURES

00:33:00.045 --> 00:33:04.115 region:rollup2
THE HAS BEEN INCREASING IS THE

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:06.184 region:rollup2
COST OF ENERGY AND IT OUT IT

00:33:04.115 --> 00:33:06.751 region:rollup2
AFFECTS. IT AFFECTS SCHOOLS

00:33:06.184 --> 00:33:07.586 region:rollup2
DIFFERENTLY ACROSS THE STATE

00:33:06.751 --> 00:33:09.487 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:33:07.586 --> 00:33:11.690 region:rollup2
WE'VE SEEN INCENDIO GO COUNTY

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:13.892 region:rollup2
WHERE SCHOOLS HAVE REALLY BEEN.

00:33:11.690 --> 00:33:15.961 region:rollup2
IMPACTED BY RATE SHOCK.

00:33:13.892 --> 00:33:17.195 region:rollup2
THESE INCREASES THAT THEY'VE

00:33:15.961 --> 00:33:18.697 region:rollup2
BEEN RECEIVING YEAR OVER YEAR

00:33:17.195 --> 00:33:20.632 region:rollup2
FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS WHICH

00:33:18.697 --> 00:33:22.033 region:rollup2
WERE NOT RECEIVING ANY MORE HAVE

00:33:20.632 --> 00:33:24.703 region:rollup2
LARGELY BEEN CONSUMED.

00:33:22.033 --> 00:33:25.370 region:rollup2
BY ENERGY EXPENDITURE INCREASES

00:33:24.703 --> 00:33:27.572 region:rollup2
SO.

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:28.940 region:rollup2
THIS ISSUE DIRECTLY AFFECTS

00:33:27.572 --> 00:33:30.475 region:rollup2
STUDENTS IN THEIR CLASSROOM AND

00:33:28.940 --> 00:33:31.543 region:rollup2
THE RESOURCES THAT WERE ABLE TO

00:33:30.475 --> 00:33:32.344 region:rollup2
DEVOTE TO THEIR EDUCATIONAL

00:33:31.543 --> 00:33:35.213 region:rollup2
NEEDS.

00:33:32.344 --> 00:33:36.181 region:rollup2
I I DID WANT TO ADDRESS ONE

00:33:35.213 --> 00:33:37.482 region:rollup2
ISSUE.

00:33:36.181 --> 00:33:39.150 region:rollup2
THAT REALLY.

00:33:37.482 --> 00:33:40.252 region:rollup2
UNDERLIES WHY THIS IS IMPORTANT

00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:42.254 region:rollup2
IT'S ADDRESSED IN THE IN THE

00:33:40.252 --> 00:33:43.989 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS WHICH WE SUPPORT ALL

00:33:42.254 --> 00:33:45.423 region:rollup2
OF THEM BUT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT

00:33:43.989 --> 00:33:46.892 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE OF.

00:33:45.423 --> 00:33:49.160 region:rollup2
PARCEL TAXES.

00:33:46.892 --> 00:33:51.229 region:rollup2
THE THE ENTIRE GOVERNMENT

00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:52.631 region:rollup2
STRUCTURE REALLY OVER OVER

00:33:51.229 --> 00:33:54.332 region:rollup2
ENERGY IS.

00:33:52.631 --> 00:33:56.034 region:rollup2
BUILT ON THE NOTION THAT LOCAL

00:33:54.332 --> 00:33:58.837 region:rollup2
EDUCATE LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL

00:33:56.034 --> 00:34:00.972 region:rollup2
AGENCIES CAN RAISE REVENUE AS

00:33:58.837 --> 00:34:02.073 region:rollup2
NEEDED WHEN THERE ARE INCREASES

00:34:00.972 --> 00:34:04.009 region:rollup2
IN OPERATIONAL EXPENDITURES BUT

00:34:02.073 --> 00:34:05.410 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY THAT JUST ISN'T

00:34:04.009 --> 00:34:07.445 region:rollup2
THE CASE WITH RESPECT TO.

00:34:05.410 --> 00:34:10.181 region:rollup2
EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES.

00:34:07.445 --> 00:34:10.982 region:rollup2
THE ANALYSIS MAKES REFERENCE TO

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:12.884 region:rollup2
THE FACT THAT.

00:34:10.982 --> 00:34:14.219 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS CAN SEEK

00:34:12.884 --> 00:34:15.120 region:rollup2
PARCEL TAXES.

00:34:14.219 --> 00:34:16.888 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:34:15.120 --> 00:34:18.123 region:rollup2
I JUST WANTED TO ADD SOME

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:19.991 region:rollup2
CONTACTS TO SAY THAT THAT

00:34:18.123 --> 00:34:24.195 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT A FEASIBLE

00:34:19.991 --> 00:34:24.663 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVE FOR MOST SCHOOL

00:34:24.195 --> 00:34:25.530 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS.

00:34:24.663 --> 00:34:26.131 region:rollup2
FEWER THAN TEN PERCENT OF THE

00:34:25.530 --> 00:34:27.232 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICT IN THE STATE

00:34:26.131 --> 00:34:28.066 region:rollup2
HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PASS THE

00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:30.268 region:rollup2
PARCEL TAX.

00:34:28.066 --> 00:34:31.570 region:rollup2
THOUGH AND YOU REALLY SEE THOSE

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:33.238 region:rollup2
FRANKLY IN THE WEALTHIER PARTS

00:34:31.570 --> 00:34:35.206 region:rollup2
OF THE STATE.

00:34:33.238 --> 00:34:36.441 region:rollup2
PARCEL TAXES ACCOUNT FOR LESS

00:34:35.206 --> 00:34:37.976 region:rollup2
THAN ONE PERCENT OF ALL OF THE

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:39.477 region:rollup2
EDUCATION FUNDING IN THE STATE

HOLDEN IN MEMBERS I'M ANA

00:35:30.795 --> 00:35:33.865 region:rollup2
FERREIRA ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOL

00:35:32.297 --> 00:35:35.800 region:rollup2
ENERGY COALITION WHERE AN

00:35:33.865 --> 00:35:36.701 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION MADE UP OF SCHOOL A

00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:37.769 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE

00:35:36.701 --> 00:35:40.305 region:rollup2
STATE AND THAT DOES INCLUDE

00:35:37.769 --> 00:35:41.806 region:rollup2
CHARTERS. AND COUNTY OFFICES OF

00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:43.308 region:rollup2
EDUCATION K. THROUGH TWELVE.

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:44.642 region:rollup2
WHEN SUPPORT OF TWENTY SIXTY

00:35:43.308 --> 00:35:46.845 region:rollup2
EIGHT BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THE

00:35:44.642 --> 00:35:48.780 region:rollup2
UNIQUE NATURE AND ENERGY LOAD.

00:35:46.845 --> 00:35:50.749 region:rollup2
OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS.

00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:52.283 region:rollup2
ELECTRICITY RATES ARE OFTEN AS

00:35:50.749 --> 00:35:54.753 region:rollup2
YOU'VE HEARD ONE OF THE TOP

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:55.587 region:rollup2
THREE MOST COSTLY ITEMS. IN A

00:35:54.753 --> 00:35:57.722 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS DISCRETIONARY

00:35:55.587 --> 00:35:58.890 region:rollup2
BUDGET.

00:35:57.722 --> 00:36:01.526 region:rollup2
SCHOOL DISTRICTS SPEND ABOUT AS

00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:03.294 region:rollup2
MUCH ON ELECTRICITY. AS THEY DO

00:36:01.526 --> 00:36:05.263 region:rollup2
ON BOOKS AND SUPPLIES.

00:36:03.294 --> 00:36:07.265 region:rollup2
WE APPRECIATE THE ANALYSIS SINCE

00:36:05.263 --> 00:36:07.732 region:rollup2
THE MTA POINTING OUT THAT RATES

00:36:07.265 --> 00:36:10.235 region:rollup2
ARE INCREASING FOR ALL

00:36:07.732 --> 00:36:11.870 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS.

00:36:10.235 --> 00:36:13.238 region:rollup2
BUT THE UNIQUENESS FOR SCHOOLS

00:36:11.870 --> 00:36:14.939 region:rollup2
IS THAT IN THE FACE OF THESE

00:36:13.238 --> 00:36:17.375 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

00:36:14.939 --> 00:36:19.244 region:rollup2
HOW THEY'RE ABLE TO RESPOND FUND

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:20.011 region:rollup2
THEY CANNOT CHANGE THE WAY THAT

00:36:19.244 --> 00:36:22.047 region:rollup2
THEY DO BUSINESS?

00:36:20.011 --> 00:36:23.515 region:rollup2
IN RESPONSE

00:36:22.047 --> 00:36:25.717 region:rollup2
EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS IS NOT

00:36:23.515 --> 00:36:28.053 region:rollup2
LIKE MANUFACTURING WIDGETS.

00:36:25.717 --> 00:36:29.387 region:rollup2
WE CANNOT. THEY CAN'T BE MOVED

00:36:28.053 --> 00:36:31.222 region:rollup2
TO THE GRAVEYARD SHIFT.

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:32.857 region:rollup2
IN THE FACE OF AN INCREASE IN

00:36:31.222 --> 00:36:35.060 region:rollup2
RATES.

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:36.127 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX STATES SIMPLY ASKS

00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.629 region:rollup2
THAT THE PC TAKE ITS OWN

00:36:36.127 --> 00:36:39.030 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATION.

00:36:37.629 --> 00:36:40.665 region:rollup2
A STUDY WHETHER SCHOOL RATE

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.700 region:rollup2
WOULD MAKE SENSE TAKING INTO

00:36:40.665 --> 00:36:44.502 region:rollup2
ACCOUNT AND ELEAZAR CONSISTENT

00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:45.503 region:rollup2
ENCYCLICAL ENERGY USAGE AND

00:36:44.502 --> 00:36:47.305 region:rollup2
VULNERABILITY TO REACT TO THESE

00:36:45.503 --> 00:36:48.873 region:rollup2
RATES.

00:36:47.305 --> 00:36:50.942 region:rollup2
SO THAT ELEAZAR MAY REVIVE.

00:36:48.873 --> 00:36:53.078 region:rollup2
MAY RECEIVE A SPECIAL RATE THAT

00:36:50.942 --> 00:36:54.512 region:rollup2
IS LOWER AND MOVES THEM FROM

00:36:53.078 --> 00:36:56.181 region:rollup2
THEIR CURRENT COMMERCIAL AND

00:36:54.512 --> 00:36:58.149 region:rollup2
INDUSTRIAL RATE CLASS.

00:36:56.181 --> 00:36:59.150 region:rollup2
WHICH IS NOT APPROPRIATE GIVEN

00:36:58.149 --> 00:37:00.952 region:rollup2
THEIR MISSION TO EDUCATE K.

00:36:59.150 --> 00:37:02.487 region:rollup2
TWELVE STUDENTS.

00:37:00.952 --> 00:37:04.022 region:rollup2
REPUBLICAN MUNICIPAL UTILITY

00:37:02.487 --> 00:37:04.856 region:rollup2
RATES ARE NOT INCLUDED BECAUSE

00:37:04.022 --> 00:37:07.158 region:rollup2
THE RATES ARE TRADITIONALLY

00:37:04.856 --> 00:37:08.493 region:rollup2
LOWER. AND BECAUSE THE BILL IS

00:37:07.158 --> 00:37:10.428 region:rollup2
SIMPLY TAKING A RECOMMENDATION

00:37:08.493 --> 00:37:12.063 region:rollup2
THAT THE PC MADE IN AUGUST OF

00:37:10.428 --> 00:37:13.431 region:rollup2
TWENTY SEVENTEEN. AND APPLYING

00:37:12.063 --> 00:37:15.934 region:rollup2
IT TO THE OTHER ELECTRICAL

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:16.768 region:rollup2
UTILITIES THAT IT REGULATES.

00:37:15.934 --> 00:37:18.036 region:rollup2
FINALLY.

00:37:16.768 --> 00:37:20.205 region:rollup2
IT IS CORRECT THAT SCHOOL

00:37:18.036 --> 00:37:22.540 region:rollup2
DISTRICTS ARE CHARTER OR COUNTY

00:37:20.205 --> 00:37:24.075 region:rollup2
OFFICES OF EDUCATION ARE UNABLE

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:25.110 region:rollup2
TO RAISE TAXES AND FEES AS

00:37:24.075 --> 00:37:26.911 region:rollup2
FINANCING MENTION.

00:37:25.110 --> 00:37:28.513 region:rollup2
IT.

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:30.248 region:rollup2
BUT SO THEY MUST ADDRESS THESE

00:37:28.513 --> 00:37:31.416 region:rollup2
RATES IN THE GENERAL FUND.

00:37:30.248 --> 00:37:33.585 region:rollup2
THIS IS THE SAME GENERAL FUND

00:37:31.416 --> 00:37:35.220 region:rollup2
THAT PAYS TEACHERS FUNDS BOOKS

00:37:33.585 --> 00:37:37.322 region:rollup2
AND OTHER TOOLS FOR LEARNING. IT

00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:39.424 region:rollup2
IS ALSO WHY WE SUPPORT AB TWENTY

00:37:37.322 --> 00:37:40.959 region:rollup2
FOUR THIRTY ONE WEBER. I'M WHICH

00:37:39.424 --> 00:37:42.961 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO BE HEARD NEXT WEEK.

00:37:40.959 --> 00:37:44.395 region:rollup2
MENTIONED AND OTHER LEGISLATION

00:37:42.961 --> 00:37:45.997 region:rollup2
IN THE ANALYSIS THAT WOULD

00:37:44.395 --> 00:37:47.432 region:rollup2
BETTER ALLOW SCHOOLS TO WEIGH IN

00:37:45.997 --> 00:37:49.167 region:rollup2
ON I OWE YOU RATES THAT MAY

00:37:47.432 --> 00:37:50.835 region:rollup2
IMPACT THEM.

00:37:49.167 --> 00:37:52.403 region:rollup2
WITH REGARD TO PARCEL TAXES

00:37:50.835 --> 00:37:53.538 region:rollup2
WHICH MUST BE PUT TO THE VOTERS

00:37:52.403 --> 00:37:57.108 region:rollup2
SCHOOLS ARE NO WAY ABLE TO

00:37:53.538 --> 00:37:59.010 region:rollup2
PREDICT WHAT KIND OF OR HOW MUCH

00:37:57.108 --> 00:38:01.279 region:rollup2
OF A RATE INCREASE. THEY MIGHT

00:37:59.010 --> 00:38:02.614 region:rollup2
RECEIVE AND TIME TO PUT A VOTER.

00:38:01.279 --> 00:38:03.882 region:rollup2
CAMPAIGN TOGETHER OR ASK

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:08.753 region:rollup2
FUTURE RATE INCREASES.

00:38:07.652 --> 00:38:10.722 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL ELECTRICITY RATE

00:38:08.753 --> 00:38:11.623 region:rollup2
INCREASES.

00:38:10.722 --> 00:38:13.291 region:rollup2
SO IT IS FOR THOSE REASONS THAT

00:38:11.623 --> 00:38:15.660 region:rollup2
WE ASK THAT YOU VOTE AYE ON

00:38:13.291 --> 00:38:17.462 region:rollup2

EXAMINING CRAFT A RATE. THAT

00:38:17.462 --> 00:38:20.565 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE THE UNIQUE NATURE AND

00:38:19.130 --> 00:38:22.500 region:rollup2
CONSISTENT USAGE.

00:38:20.565 --> 00:38:24.302 region:rollup2
PUBLIC SCHOOLS THEM ASSEMBLY

TO MAKE ONE NOTE IF.

00:39:16.454 --> 00:39:17.856 region:rollup2
THE CHAIR WOULD INDULGE FOR A

THEM THEIR ENERGY COSTS ARE

00:39:35.206 --> 00:39:37.809 region:rollup2
LOWER THAT MAKES US LESS

CLEAN RENEWABLE ENERGY BONDS

01:04:31.401 --> 01:04:35.805 region:rollup2

THE COUNTIES COST SAVINGS ON THE

01:05:32.595 --> 01:05:38.234 region:rollup2

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:40.036 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANTLY THAT THE PROJECTED

01:09:05.808 --> 01:09:08.578 region:rollup2
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS

01:09:07.310 --> 01:09:10.313 region:rollup2
MAKES SENSE ON IT IS A

01:09:08.578 --> 01:09:12.882 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT COST SHIFT IT DOES

01:09:10.313 --> 01:09:13.916 region:rollup2
NOT SATISFY THE STANDARD OF

01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:16.586 region:rollup2
INDIFFERENCE THAT IS ARTICULATED

01:09:13.916 --> 01:09:18.321 region:rollup2
IN THE ANALYSIS. AN EXISTING LAW

01:09:16.586 --> 01:09:21.190 region:rollup2
THEREFORE WE THINK THAT IT DOES

01:09:18.321 --> 01:09:23.359 region:rollup2
NOT STAND UP TO ANY SCRUTINY.

01:09:21.190 --> 01:09:24.694 region:rollup2
IN ADDITION AND THE REQUIREMENT

01:09:23.359 --> 01:09:27.397 region:rollup2
THAT THE GENERATION RATE

01:09:24.694 --> 01:09:29.766 region:rollup2
INCREASE BY THREE PERCENT PER

01:09:27.397 --> 01:09:30.933 region:rollup2
YEAR FOR EVER IS INCONSISTENT

01:09:29.766 --> 01:09:32.502 region:rollup2
WITH THE DIRECTION RATES ARE

01:09:30.933 --> 01:09:34.570 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY GOING GIVEN THE

01:09:32.502 --> 01:09:36.506 region:rollup2
CHANGING TIME OF USE PERIODS. IT

01:09:34.570 --> 01:09:38.541 region:rollup2
SETS UP A VERY SIGNIFICANT

01:09:36.506 --> 01:09:40.843 region:rollup2
SUBSIDY STREAM INTO THE FUTURE

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:42.078 region:rollup2
AND IT IS IN TOTAL CONTRAST TO

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.579 region:rollup2
THE EVOLUTION OF NET METERING

01:09:42.078 --> 01:09:44.714 region:rollup2
POLICY. AT THE PUBLIC UTILITIES

01:09:43.579 --> 01:09:46.883 region:rollup2
COMMISSION

01:09:44.714 --> 01:09:48.551 region:rollup2
SO WE DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY THIS

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:50.386 region:rollup2
POLICY IS CONSISTENT WITH

01:09:48.551 --> 01:09:51.387 region:rollup2
EXISTING PRACTICE WITH WHAT WE

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:53.089 region:rollup2
EXPECT TO BE THE FUTURE

01:09:51.387 --> 01:09:55.091 region:rollup2
EVOLUTION OF NET METERING. AND

01:09:53.089 --> 01:09:56.059 region:rollup2
IT REALLY I'M HANDCUFFS THE P.

01:09:55.091 --> 01:09:58.161 region:rollup2
YOU SEE FROM BEING ABLE TO

01:09:56.059 --> 01:09:59.762 region:rollup2
DEVELOP REASONABLE RATE DESIGN

01:09:58.161 --> 01:10:00.797 region:rollup2
THAT BALANCES THE INTERESTS OF

01:09:59.762 --> 01:10:02.265 region:rollup2
THE CUSTOMERS WHO WOULD BE

01:10:00.797 --> 01:10:03.666 region:rollup2
BENEFITING FROM THIS PROGRAM.

01:10:02.265 --> 01:10:05.401 region:rollup2
AND THE REMAINING CUSTOMERS.

01:10:03.666 --> 01:10:05.868 region:rollup2
WHO WOULD HAVE TO PAY FOR THE

01:10:05.401 --> 01:10:09.005 region:rollup2
COST OF THE PROGRAM?

01:10:05.868 --> 01:10:10.440 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

01:10:09.005 --> 01:10:11.574 region:rollup2
OKAY AT CHERRY MEMBERS THE GOING

01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.042 region:rollup2

ELECTRIC.

01:10:13.042 --> 01:10:15.311 region:rollup2
WHAT THINK THE STAFF AT THE

01:10:14.310 --> 01:10:16.446 region:rollup2
CONFERENCE OF ANALYSIS SOMEWHERE

01:10:15.311 --> 01:10:17.180 region:rollup2
HERE TO POSE AB TWO TWO SEVEN

01:10:16.446 --> 01:10:18.948 region:rollup2
EIGHT?

01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.383 region:rollup2
AYE WE BELIEVE THIS IS

01:10:18.948 --> 01:10:21.584 region:rollup2
LEGISLATIVE RIGHT MAKING AND AS

01:10:20.383 --> 01:10:23.786 region:rollup2
A CONSIDER A LOT OF FACTORS A

01:10:21.584 --> 01:10:25.421 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR SYSTEM BENEFITS.

01:10:23.786 --> 01:10:28.424 region:rollup2
GENERATION COSTS AND IMPACTS TO

01:10:25.421 --> 01:10:28.691 region:rollup2
OTHER CUSTOMERS A PARTICULAR

01:10:28.424 --> 01:10:29.826 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS.

01:10:28.691 --> 01:10:30.726 region:rollup2
.

01:10:29.826 --> 01:10:31.861 region:rollup2
AS WAS MENTIONED AT TIME OF USE

01:10:30.726 --> 01:10:33.796 region:rollup2
HAS BEEN A LONG ANTICIPATED

01:10:31.861 --> 01:10:35.331 region:rollup2
POLICY ON THE LEGISLATURE CPC

01:10:33.796 --> 01:10:37.366 region:rollup2
AND OTHERLOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE

01:10:35.331 --> 01:10:38.701 region:rollup2
ENDORSED ON THIS NEW THAT PEAK

01:10:37.366 --> 01:10:40.403 region:rollup2
PERIOD THAT WE'VE SHIPPED TO.

01:10:38.701 --> 01:10:41.738 region:rollup2
AND THE BILL AS WAS MENTIONED

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:42.472 region:rollup2
ALSO REVERTS BACK TO PREVIOUS

01:10:41.738 --> 01:10:43.339 region:rollup2
TIME FRAME WITH THE FULL

01:10:42.472 --> 01:10:45.308 region:rollup2
DEFINITION WHICH IS WHOLLY

01:10:43.339 --> 01:10:47.844 region:rollup2
COUNTERINTUITIVE TO. NOT ONLY.

01:10:45.308 --> 01:10:51.114 region:rollup2
ENCOURAGING ENERGY CONSERVATION

01:10:47.844 --> 01:10:51.647 region:rollup2
BUT ALSO A ONE EIGHTY HAVE FLED

01:10:51.114 --> 01:10:52.882 region:rollup2
FROM WHAT LEGISLATURE HAS

01:10:51.647 --> 01:10:53.516 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED.

01:10:52.882 --> 01:10:55.218 region:rollup2
AND WE BELIEVE THAT UNDER THIS

01:10:53.516 --> 01:10:56.953 region:rollup2
RATE STRUCTURE OF THE PRICES DO

01:10:55.218 --> 01:10:59.222 region:rollup2
NOT REFLECT THE ACTUAL VALUE OF

01:10:56.953 --> 01:11:00.256 region:rollup2
ENERGY PRODUCED OR CONSUMED AND

01:10:59.222 --> 01:11:02.058 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THIS WOULD HAVE.

01:11:00.256 --> 01:11:03.693 region:rollup2
AT A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR

01:11:02.058 --> 01:11:04.393 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS.

01:11:03.693 --> 01:11:06.662 region:rollup2
ANOTHER.

01:11:04.393 --> 01:11:07.096 region:rollup2
ISSUE I WOULD LIKE TO MENTION

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:08.397 region:rollup2
IS THAT IT IGNORES.

01:11:07.096 --> 01:11:10.800 region:rollup2
.

01:11:08.397 --> 01:11:12.068 region:rollup2
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SHIFTING TO UP

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:12.902 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION AND

01:11:12.068 --> 01:11:15.171 region:rollup2

01:11:12.902 --> 01:11:15.972 region:rollup2
SERVING IN OUR AYE YOU CUSTOMERS

01:11:15.171 --> 01:11:17.640 region:rollup2

01:11:15.972 --> 01:11:20.009 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS ARE NOT MANDATED TO.

01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:21.644 region:rollup2
TO TO GO TO TIME OF USE.

01:11:20.009 --> 01:11:23.212 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S NOT FAIR FOR OTHER

01:11:21.644 --> 01:11:24.714 region:rollup2
CUSTOMERS AND WILL BE WHO WILL

01:11:23.212 --> 01:11:26.015 region:rollup2
BE STUCK PAYING THE BILL.

01:11:24.714 --> 01:11:27.617 region:rollup2
WHILE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:11:26.015 --> 01:11:28.050 region:rollup2
CHOOSING TO DEPART BUT POINTING

01:11:27.617 --> 01:11:31.387 region:rollup2
TO.

01:11:28.050 --> 01:11:32.622 region:rollup2
LOCK IN RATES FOR THE REMAINING

IT UP FACILITIES.

01:20:30.125 --> 01:20:33.629 region:rollup2
CARBON EACH SECTOR ADMITS.

01:20:31.794 --> 01:20:35.064 region:rollup2
FRANKLY WE CAN DO MORE AS A

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:36.699 region:rollup2
STATE TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES

01:20:35.064 --> 01:20:38.500 region:rollup2
INCLUDING WATERSHEDS TO ALLOW

VOTED FOR THAT BILL THE CREATED.

01:20:54.817 --> 01:20:57.319 region:rollup2
THE REASON WE NEED THIS BILL IS

01:20:56.218 --> 01:20:58.554 region:rollup2
NOT BECAUSE WE DON'T TRUST THE I

01:20:58.554 --> 01:21:01.957 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE NEED TO PROVIDE MARK

UNCERTAINTY TO DEVELOPERS NOW SO

01:21:01.957 --> 01:21:06.361 region:rollup2

THESE FACILITIES NOW.

01:21:13.369 --> 01:21:16.305 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY APPEAL COUNTY DOES

NOT HAVE THE LUXURY.

01:21:16.305 --> 01:21:20.209 region:rollup2

01:21:19.108 --> 01:21:21.810 region:rollup2
THE STATE HAS KICK STARTED ITS

CONVERT AGRICULTURE WASTE INTO

SHOULD BE USING THIS TECHNOLOGY

01:23:40.182 --> 01:23:43.485 region:rollup2
TO AVOID THE SORT OF OPEN BURNS

01:23:41.583 --> 01:23:44.720 region:rollup2

SO THEY CAN SERVE AS BASELOAD

OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY TWO OO

01:34:39.507 --> 01:34:43.111 region:rollup2
EIGHT I'M WE'RE NOT INTERESTED

IN SEEING EXISTING BIOMASS AND

GEOTHERMAL FACILITIES IN THE

01:34:44.412 --> 01:34:47.815 region:rollup2

01:34:46.447 --> 01:34:50.218 region:rollup2
DON'T WANT TO PAY AND

01:34:47.815 --> 01:34:51.286 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY PREMIUM TO GET IN

THE FUTURE WHAT WE'VE

01:34:51.286 --> 01:34:53.555 region:rollup2
HISTORICALLY ALREADY BEEN

01:34:52.287 --> 01:34:54.822 region:rollup2
RECEIVING.

01:34:53.555 --> 01:34:56.157 region:rollup2
AND WE THINK THIS BILL COMES

01:34:54.822 --> 01:34:57.258 region:rollup2
FROM A PLACE OF GOOD INTENTION

01:34:56.157 --> 01:34:59.160 region:rollup2
BUT THERE ARE SOME SERIOUS

01:34:57.258 --> 01:35:00.562 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS WITH THE MECHANICS.

01:34:59.160 --> 01:35:02.564 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY THIS BILL WOULD

01:35:00.562 --> 01:35:03.831 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARILY RAISE THE COST OF

01:35:02.564 --> 01:35:06.067 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE WITH THE RP ES

01:35:03.831 --> 01:35:07.569 region:rollup2
PROGRAM. FOR RETAIL CONSUMERS

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:09.904 region:rollup2
AND WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE OWNERS

01:35:07.569 --> 01:35:10.738 region:rollup2
OF EXISTING ASSETS THAT QUALIFY

01:35:09.904 --> 01:35:13.274 region:rollup2
UNDER THE DEFINITIONS OF THIS

01:35:10.738 --> 01:35:15.343 region:rollup2
BILL. TO EXERCISE MARKET POWER

01:35:13.274 --> 01:35:16.878 region:rollup2
BY RAISING THEIR PRICES.

01:35:15.343 --> 01:35:19.147 region:rollup2
DON THAT'S OUR FUNDAMENTAL

01:35:16.878 --> 01:35:20.648 region:rollup2
CONCERN I'M WE ALSO WOULD NOTE

01:35:19.147 --> 01:35:22.550 region:rollup2
THAT THE BILL IS STRUCTURED TO

01:35:20.648 --> 01:35:24.786 region:rollup2
ESSENTIALLY REQUIRE COMPLIANCE

01:35:22.550 --> 01:35:25.320 region:rollup2
BASED ON TOTAL PROCUREMENT OF A

01:35:24.786 --> 01:35:27.255 region:rollup2
CERTAIN NUMBER OF MEGAWATT

01:35:25.320 --> 01:35:28.790 region:rollup2
HOURS.

01:35:27.255 --> 01:35:30.491 region:rollup2
THE BILL SPEAKS TO THE ISSUE OF

01:35:28.790 --> 01:35:31.459 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY IN GENERATION AND

01:35:30.491 --> 01:35:33.027 region:rollup2
WANTING TO INCORPORATE

01:35:31.459 --> 01:35:34.696 region:rollup2
GENERATION THAT CAN RAMP UP OR

01:35:33.027 --> 01:35:35.964 region:rollup2
DOWN TO MEET SYSTEM LOAD BUT

01:35:34.696 --> 01:35:38.066 region:rollup2
COMPLIANCE IS MEASURED BASED ON

01:35:35.964 --> 01:35:39.133 region:rollup2
TOTAL PROCUREMENT AND SO ALL OF

01:35:38.066 --> 01:35:40.735 region:rollup2
THE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD BE

01:35:39.133 --> 01:35:42.870 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATED TO MEET THE STANDARDS

01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:44.038 region:rollup2
AND THIS BILL. WOULD BE DESIGNED

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:45.607 region:rollup2
TO FORCE THESE FACILITIES TO

01:35:44.038 --> 01:35:47.208 region:rollup2
GENERATE THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF

01:35:45.607 --> 01:35:48.943 region:rollup2
MEGAWATT HOURS NOT TO OPERATE AS

01:35:47.208 --> 01:35:50.144 region:rollup2
LOAD FOLLOWING FACILITIES. NOT

01:35:48.943 --> 01:35:50.945 region:rollup2
TO TRY TO INTEGRATE OTHER

01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:52.680 region:rollup2
RESOURCES

01:35:50.945 --> 01:35:55.383 region:rollup2
IT'S FUNDAMENTALLY INCONSISTENT

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:56.818 region:rollup2
WITH THE IDEA BEHIND THE BILL.

01:35:55.383 --> 01:35:58.920 region:rollup2
MOREOVER THE DEFINITION OF

01:35:56.818 --> 01:36:01.389 region:rollup2
ELIGIBLE RESOURCES RAISES THE

01:35:58.920 --> 01:36:03.057 region:rollup2
POTENTIAL THAT FIRST OF ALL ON

01:36:01.389 --> 01:36:04.859 region:rollup2
EXISTING SMALL HYDRO ELECTRIC

01:36:03.057 --> 01:36:07.262 region:rollup2
GENERATION MIGHT QUALIFY AS A

01:36:04.859 --> 01:36:07.895 region:rollup2
RENEWABLE FLEXIBLE GENERATION

01:36:07.262 --> 01:36:09.063 region:rollup2
RESOURCE ONE OF THE DEFINITIONS

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:10.732 region:rollup2
HERE.

01:36:09.063 --> 01:36:12.100 region:rollup2
AND IN ADDITION I AM I WOULD

01:36:10.732 --> 01:36:14.102 region:rollup2
EXPECT

01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:14.636 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COMPLIANCE

01:36:14.102 --> 01:36:16.504 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THE SALTON SEA

01:36:14.636 --> 01:36:18.273 region:rollup2
PORTION TO COME FROM OUT OF

01:36:16.504 --> 01:36:20.008 region:rollup2
STATE RESOURCES THAT ALREADY

01:36:18.273 --> 01:36:21.743 region:rollup2
PROVIDE. SOME OF THEIR OUTPUT

01:36:20.008 --> 01:36:23.645 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA LOAD SERVING ENTITIES

01:36:21.743 --> 01:36:24.178 region:rollup2
AND WOULD BE HIGHLY MOTIVATED TO

01:36:23.645 --> 01:36:25.813 region:rollup2
TAKE ADVANTAGE OF PREMIUM

01:36:24.178 --> 01:36:26.581 region:rollup2
PRICING.

01:36:25.813 --> 01:36:28.583 region:rollup2
IT WILL BE AVAILABLE UNDER THIS

01:36:26.581 --> 01:36:29.884 region:rollup2
BILL FOR EXAMPLE THE PROVINCE OF

01:36:28.583 --> 01:36:30.652 region:rollup2
BRITISH COLUMBIA HAS OVER NINE

01:36:29.884 --> 01:36:32.253 region:rollup2
HUNDRED MEGAWATTS OF EXISTING

01:36:30.652 --> 01:36:33.855 region:rollup2
BIOMASS

01:36:32.253 --> 01:36:36.024 region:rollup2
AND THEY ALREADY TRIED TO MARKET

01:36:33.855 --> 01:36:37.558 region:rollup2
MUCH OF THAT TO CALIFORNIA. SO I

01:36:36.024 --> 01:36:39.093 region:rollup2
WOULD BE WARY ABOUT THE IDEA

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:41.195 region:rollup2
THAT THIS BILL IS NECESSARILY

01:36:39.093 --> 01:36:43.297 region:rollup2
GOING TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING

01:36:41.195 --> 01:36:44.799 region:rollup2
BASE OF RESOURCES IN THE STATE

01:36:43.297 --> 01:36:47.402 region:rollup2
ON THAT THE SPONSORS ARE HOPING.

01:36:44.799 --> 01:36:48.803 region:rollup2
ON TO PROTECT ON THE BILL AND

01:36:47.402 --> 01:36:50.305 region:rollup2
THEN FINALLY WHILE WE SUPPORT

01:36:48.803 --> 01:36:52.006 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT OF GEOTHERMAL IN THE

01:36:50.305 --> 01:36:53.508 region:rollup2
SALTON SEA.

01:36:52.006 --> 01:36:54.909 region:rollup2
THE MECHANISM FOR ACCOMPLISHING

01:36:53.508 --> 01:36:57.345 region:rollup2
THAT THROUGH THIS BILL IS SIMPLY

01:36:54.909 --> 01:36:58.413 region:rollup2
ON WORKABLE IT WOULD REQUIRE

VERY SMALL NUMBER OF NEW

01:37:04.819 --> 01:37:07.722 region:rollup2
GENERATING FACILITIES THAT WOULD

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:09.724 region:rollup2
BE BUILT IN A SPECIFIC

01:37:07.722 --> 01:37:11.292 region:rollup2
GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

01:37:09.724 --> 01:37:12.827 region:rollup2
WE THINK THAT IT'S UNWORKABLE AS

01:37:11.292 --> 01:37:14.462 region:rollup2
DRAFTED ON AND THERE'S NO

01:37:12.827 --> 01:37:15.830 region:rollup2
MECHANISM TO MAKE THIS WORK IN

01:37:14.462 --> 01:37:17.131 region:rollup2
ADDITION WE THINK THERE IS

01:37:15.830 --> 01:37:18.633 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY DORMANT COMMERCE

01:37:17.131 --> 01:37:20.301 region:rollup2
CLAUSE VIOLATION AS IDENTIFIED

IN THE ANALYSIS.

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:23.304 region:rollup2
I'M WE THINK THERE'S NOT A NEED

01:37:21.569 --> 01:37:24.706 region:rollup2

01:37:23.304 --> 01:37:26.874 region:rollup2

BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR

01:37:29.610 --> 01:37:37.185 region:rollup2

BILL GETS THERE THANK YOU.

01:37:37.185 --> 01:37:39.821 region:rollup2

LARGE SCALE SOLAR ASSOCIATION.

01:37:41.456 --> 01:37:44.759 region:rollup2
ONE ECHO EVERYTHING OF THAT

01:37:43.391 --> 01:37:46.427 region:rollup2
MATT FRIEDMAN SAID ABOUT THE

01:37:44.759 --> 01:37:47.995 region:rollup2
BILL I THINK HE HE OCCURRED OUR

01:37:46.427 --> 01:37:49.163 region:rollup2
CONCERNS ARE WHAT AT A COUPLE OF

01:37:47.995 --> 01:37:50.832 region:rollup2
OTHERS.

01:37:49.163 --> 01:37:52.166 region:rollup2
ONE IS THAT YOU KNOW BUT CARVE

01:37:50.832 --> 01:37:53.468 region:rollup2
OUTS IN THE CONTEXT.

01:37:52.166 --> 01:37:55.203 region:rollup2
OF THE RENEWABLE PORTFOLIO

01:37:53.468 --> 01:37:56.270 region:rollup2
STANDARD ARE DIFFICULT AND THE

01:37:55.203 --> 01:37:58.072 region:rollup2
MARKET REALLY SHOULD BE THE ONE

01:37:56.270 --> 01:37:59.874 region:rollup2
DICTATING WHICH ENERGY SOURCES

01:37:58.072 --> 01:38:01.175 region:rollup2
ARE PROCURED IN WHICH.

01:37:59.874 --> 01:38:02.543 region:rollup2
WHICH AREN'T SO THAT'S

01:38:01.175 --> 01:38:03.945 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WERE WERE

01:38:02.543 --> 01:38:05.146 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY CONCERNED ABOUT WE

01:38:03.945 --> 01:38:06.447 region:rollup2
ALSO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

01:38:05.146 --> 01:38:08.182 region:rollup2
PRO KEEP FORCING THE PROCUREMENT

01:38:06.447 --> 01:38:09.016 region:rollup2
AFFIRMED RESOURCES FOR THE MOST

01:38:08.182 --> 01:38:10.618 region:rollup2
PART THERE IS A LOT OF

01:38:09.016 --> 01:38:12.186 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:38:10.618 --> 01:38:13.521 region:rollup2
CHEER THERMAL AND BIOMASS.

01:38:12.186 --> 01:38:15.223 region:rollup2
AND RIGHT NOW THE GRID NEEDS

01:38:13.521 --> 01:38:17.759 region:rollup2
FLEXIBLE RESOURCES MORE THAN IT

01:38:15.223 --> 01:38:19.260 region:rollup2
NEEDS FROM RESOURCES SO TO FORCE

01:38:17.759 --> 01:38:21.429 region:rollup2
A TECHNOLOGY INTO THE GRID.

01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:23.131 region:rollup2
FOR VARIOUS REASONS OTHER THAN

01:38:21.429 --> 01:38:23.731 region:rollup2
THAT THAT THERE NEEDED TO

01:38:23.131 --> 01:38:25.166 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT I THINK WE NEED

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:26.934 region:rollup2
TO REVISIT.

01:38:25.166 --> 01:38:28.302 region:rollup2
MORE BROADLY I THINK THIS THIS

01:38:26.934 --> 01:38:29.804 region:rollup2
BILL AND I THINK THE ANALYSIS

01:38:28.302 --> 01:38:30.838 region:rollup2
RAISES THE ISSUE PROCUREMENT

01:38:29.804 --> 01:38:32.907 region:rollup2
MORE GENERALLY RIGHT NOW

01:38:30.838 --> 01:38:33.374 region:rollup2
RENEWABLES PROCUREMENT IN THE

01:38:32.907 --> 01:38:34.842 region:rollup2
STATE HAS SLOWED DOWN.

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:36.144 region:rollup2
.

01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:37.612 region:rollup2
ALMOST TO A FULL STOP WHEN IT

01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:39.113 region:rollup2
COMES TO THE INVESTOR OWNED

01:38:37.612 --> 01:38:40.782 region:rollup2
UTILITIES THE CCA'S ARE

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:42.183 region:rollup2
PROCURING SOME. BUT THERE'S A

01:38:40.782 --> 01:38:43.184 region:rollup2
LOT OF MARKET UNCERTAINTY AND I

01:38:42.183 --> 01:38:44.519 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT.

01:38:43.184 --> 01:38:45.887 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA WAS

01:38:44.519 --> 01:38:47.722 region:rollup2

01:38:47.722 --> 01:38:51.626 region:rollup2
CERTAINTY FOR THESE DEVELOPERS.

01:38:49.624 --> 01:38:53.060 region:rollup2
I WOULD GO ON TO SAY THAT THIS

01:38:51.626 --> 01:38:54.128 region:rollup2
THOUGH THAT WHAT WE NEED IS

01:38:53.060 --> 01:38:55.997 region:rollup2

01:44:43.677 --> 01:44:48.282 region:rollup2

AN OPEN BOOK HERE.

01:45:01.128 --> 01:45:03.731 region:rollup2

DARCY OF TO HAVE A COMMENT BUT I

01:48:02.343 --> 01:48:05.612 region:rollup2

01:48:03.544 --> 01:48:07.147 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION AT

01:48:05.612 --> 01:48:09.516 region:rollup2

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:12.786 region:rollup2
WITHOUT PERCENTAGES WE WERE

01:48:11.085 --> 01:48:14.088 region:rollup2

THAT YOU KNOW AS THAT MEMBER

01:50:24.351 --> 01:50:27.721 region:rollup2
FROM INGLEWOOD I'M PROBABLY THE

01:50:26.253 --> 01:50:29.456 region:rollup2
LEAST LIKELY SUPPORTER OF

01:50:27.721 --> 01:50:30.724 region:rollup2
BIOMASS BUT I'M INCREDIBLY HUGE

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:31.325 region:rollup2
SUPPORTER OF BIOMASS I THINK

01:50:30.724 --> 01:50:32.659 region:rollup2
THAT THERE ARE GREAT

01:50:31.325 --> 01:50:34.261 region:rollup2

ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ISSUE I

01:50:35.829 --> 01:50:39.099 region:rollup2

THE LARGEST GENERATORS OF CICI

01:50:43.604 --> 01:50:46.106 region:rollup2
