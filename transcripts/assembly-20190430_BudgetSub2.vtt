NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:26.857
AVAILABLE THAT MEANS THAT ONLY A

00:40:26.924 --> 00:40:28.959
SMALL SHARE OF THOSE WHO ARE

GO ON TO RECEIVE.

00:40:34.498 --> 00:40:35.032
AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCES

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.415
WE GET THE GOVERNOR IDENTIFIES A

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:52.316
POTENTIALLY IMPORTANT AREA OF

THIS SUB GROUP OF STUDENTS WHOSE

00:40:55.753 --> 00:40:57.254
FINANCIAL NEEDS ARE LIKELY NOT

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:59.623
MET BY OUR CURRENT SYSTEM.

00:40:59.690 --> 00:41:01.125
THAT BEING SAID WE HAVE A NUMBER

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:02.426
OF CONCERNS WITH HOW THE

PROPOSAL IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED.

00:41:05.129 --> 00:41:06.063
THE FIRST OF THOSE CONCERNS IS

00:41:06.130 --> 00:41:07.531
THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS OVER

00:41:07.598 --> 00:41:09.166

00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:17.908
WIDE.

00:41:17.975 --> 00:41:18.509
FIVE WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:20.110
PROPOSAL WOULD ACT COUNTER TO

00:41:20.177 --> 00:41:21.645
THE SUBJECTIVE BY INTRODUCING A

00:41:21.712 --> 00:41:22.980
NEW SET OF RULES THAT ONLY

00:41:23.047 --> 00:41:24.381
IMPACT ONE SUBGROUP OF

00:41:24.448 --> 00:41:26.350
FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS OF

00:41:26.417 --> 00:41:27.685
COMPLICATING THE SYSTEM FOR

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:30.154
STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE.

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.589
TURN THE PAGE ALSO SEE THAT WE

00:41:31.655 --> 00:41:32.990
HAVE A RELATED DISTRIBUTIONAL

00:41:33.057 --> 00:41:35.092
CONCERN.

00:41:35.159 --> 00:41:37.561
WHAT IS STUDENT HAS CHILDREN IS

00:41:37.628 --> 00:41:38.963
ONE PART OF THEIR OVERALL

00:41:39.029 --> 00:41:40.130
FINANCIAL NEED?

00:41:40.197 --> 00:41:41.699
OTHER MAJOR FACTORS THAT MIGHT

00:41:41.765 --> 00:41:43.067
SHAPE THAT NEED INCLUDE THE

00:41:43.133 --> 00:41:44.902
STUDENTS HOUSEHOLD INCOME ASSET

00:41:44.969 --> 00:41:46.737
SIZE AND SO FORTH.

00:41:46.804 --> 00:41:48.239
WE ARE CONCERNED THAT BY A

00:41:48.305 --> 00:41:49.974
PRIORITIZE NEED ACCORDING TO ONE

00:41:50.040 --> 00:41:51.141
COMPONENT OF THE OVERALL NEED

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:52.276
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL COULD

00:41:52.343 --> 00:41:53.611

00:41:58.482 --> 00:42:00.150
COSTS.

00:42:00.217 --> 00:42:02.820
BASED ON THAT PANEL STATUS.

00:42:02.887 --> 00:42:04.722
IT IS ALSO WORTH NOTING THAT.

00:42:04.788 --> 00:42:05.923
MANY STUDENTS PARENTS WOULD NOT

00:42:05.990 --> 00:42:07.391
RECEIVE ADDITIONAL AID UNDER THE

NUMBER OF COMPATIBLE WITH.

00:42:17.801 --> 00:42:19.003
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.070
NOT PROVIDE ADDITIONAL

00:42:20.137 --> 00:42:20.971

00:42:24.275 --> 00:42:25.109
IT ALSO WOULD NOT PROVIDE

00:42:31.749 --> 00:42:33.284
THESE REASONS WE DO RECOMMEND

00:42:33.350 --> 00:42:34.485

00:42:37.621 --> 00:42:38.722
THIS PROPOSAL RAISES IMPORTANT

00:42:38.789 --> 00:42:40.190
QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OUR

NEEDS OF STUDENTS PARENTS.

00:42:43.694 --> 00:42:44.561
AND SO THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH

00:42:44.628 --> 00:42:46.697

00:42:46.764 --> 00:42:48.399

00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.094
I THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT

00:44:24.161 --> 00:44:25.162
BECAUSE AS I LOOK BACK AND I

00:44:25.229 --> 00:44:26.597
I'VE BEEN WATCHING THIS FOR A

00:44:26.663 --> 00:44:28.132
COUPLE YEARS WE HAVE THIS.

00:44:31.802 --> 00:44:32.936
COMPLEX.

FOR STUDENTS TO TO TO MATCH NAY

00:44:39.576 --> 00:44:43.547

YEARS AGO I FOUND IT.

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:44.715
VERY DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND

00:44:44.782 --> 00:44:46.183
WHAT WAS AVAILABLE TO ME IF

00:44:46.250 --> 00:44:47.985
ANYTHING WAS AVAILABLE TO ME SO

00:44:48.052 --> 00:44:49.520
I JUST IGNORED IT BECAUSE IT WAS

00:44:49.586 --> 00:44:51.455
SO COMPLEX.

00:44:51.522 --> 00:44:53.390
HI I WAS WORKING.

00:44:53.457 --> 00:44:54.758
IN FULL TIME AT THAT POINT --

00:44:54.825 --> 00:44:57.594
AND GOING ALONG THE STATE -- BUT

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:59.096
AGAIN I I APPRECIATE THAT AND

00:44:59.163 --> 00:45:00.597
AGAIN I I JUST I AM.

00:45:00.664 --> 00:45:01.665
WHAT I'M HEARING FROM MIDDLE

00:45:01.732 --> 00:45:03.967
CLASS FAMILIES IS IS WHERE'S THE

00:45:04.034 --> 00:45:06.203
SUPPORT FOR THEM I KNOW WE HAVE

00:45:06.270 --> 00:45:08.238
THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP?

00:45:08.305 --> 00:45:08.872
WHICH IS DONE IN A FROM A BROAD

00:45:08.939 --> 00:45:11.008
PERSPECTIVE AYE AYE AYE WE NEED

00:45:11.075 --> 00:45:11.642
TO SUPPORT THAT WE NEED A SPORT

00:45:11.708 --> 00:45:12.476
THAT MORE.

00:45:12.543 --> 00:45:13.577
WE DIDN'T MAKE SURE THAT

00:45:13.644 --> 00:45:15.879

00:45:15.946 --> 00:45:20.117
SHARE -- GOOD A DECENT NOW.

00:45:20.184 --> 00:45:22.086

AVERAGE GETS THROUGH SCHOOL AND

00:45:24.088 --> 00:45:26.523
IN AN EXPEDITIOUS FASHION SO I'M

00:45:26.590 --> 00:45:28.258
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT.

00:45:28.325 --> 00:45:29.660
THE MIDDLE CLASS SCHOLARSHIP IS

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:30.427
ONE HERE FROM AN A PLUS PARENTS

YOU KNOW THERE'S SHE WHO WHO

00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:37.801
SUPPORTING THEM.

00:45:37.868 --> 00:45:38.802
BECAUSE WHEN YOU'VE GOT A FAMILY

00:45:38.869 --> 00:45:40.237
EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE MIDDLE CLASS --

00:45:40.304 --> 00:45:42.106
SEE ISSUE OR YOU SEE A EDUCATION

00:45:42.172 --> 00:45:43.207
IS VERY EXPENSIVE.

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:44.174
SO AGAIN I WANT TO BE A

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:45.142
SUPPORTIVE OF THE MIDDLE CLASS

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:46.577

MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T GET HE

00:45:47.377 --> 00:45:49.213

00:45:49.279 --> 00:45:51.715
FACT SUPPORT THAT AS WE GO

00:45:51.782 --> 00:45:52.249

00:45:52.316 --> 00:45:54.351

00:45:54.418 --> 00:45:55.986
CAN AFFORD IT WE KNOW THAT HI

00:45:56.053 --> 00:45:58.021
BUT I THINK YOU KNOW I I HEAR A

00:45:58.088 --> 00:45:59.156
LOT OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES

00:45:59.223 --> 00:46:01.125
AFTER HER VERY FRUSTRATED WITH

00:46:01.191 --> 00:46:01.859
GOVERNMENT.

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:05.863
AND I THINK THAT'S CERTAINLY

00:46:05.929 --> 00:46:06.430
BLOOD IN OUR POLITICAL ARENA

00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:07.831
TODAY BECAUSE THEY FEEL LIKE YOU

00:46:07.898 --> 00:46:08.432
KNOW THIS STATE DOESN'T WATCH

00:46:08.499 --> 00:46:08.799
OUT FOR THEM.

00:46:08.866 --> 00:46:09.399
AND SOMETIMES I THINK THAT'S

00:46:09.466 --> 00:46:10.067
TRUE SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE

00:46:10.134 --> 00:46:11.101

00:46:11.168 --> 00:46:12.503
SCHOLARSHIP GOING FORWARD.

00:46:12.569 --> 00:46:15.839

GREATER LENGTH ISSUE -- NUMBER.

00:46:28.886 --> 00:46:30.454
FIVE BUT I I GUESS THIS DOES

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:32.556
RAISE THAT SAME ISSUE WHICH

00:46:32.623 --> 00:46:34.258

00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:44.001
THIS THING THIS CAL GRANT

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:47.137

AND THAT'S WERE TRYING TO GO THE

00:46:56.580 --> 00:46:57.881
OPPOSITE DIRECTION WITH THAT NOT

THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S NOT

00:46:59.483 --> 00:47:01.818
IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT STUDENTS

00:47:01.885 --> 00:47:04.087
WHO ARE PARENTS BUT YOU KNOW

00:47:04.154 --> 00:47:05.989

THOSE ARE SOME QUESTIONS WE

00:47:33.717 --> 00:47:34.651
DON'T WANT TO MINIMIZE THE

00:47:34.718 --> 00:47:37.654

I WILL BE FROM THE COMMISSION

00:52:01.485 --> 00:52:03.653
PERSPECTIVE WE HAD NECESSARILY.

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.522
THOUGHT ABOUT DOING A TARGET

00:52:05.589 --> 00:52:07.591
WITHIN THE COMPETITIVE PROGRAM --

00:52:07.657 --> 00:52:09.059
WE'VE TENDED TO TAKE MORE OF A

00:52:09.125 --> 00:52:10.727
BLANKET POSITION THAT ANY

00:52:10.794 --> 00:52:11.828

IS YOU KNOW A GOOD THING AND

00:52:14.231 --> 00:52:15.966
THAT WE WOULD SUPPORT IT AND

00:52:16.032 --> 00:52:16.600
THAT IT WOULD HAVE THOSE SORT OF

00:52:16.666 --> 00:52:20.470
RIPPLE POSITIVE AFFECTS -- SO I

00:52:20.537 --> 00:52:22.472

SPECIFIC NEEDS SUCH AS STUDENT

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:29.646

00:52:35.318 --> 00:52:37.053
TARGETING JUST YET [inaudible]

GOVERNOR'S BUDGET.

00:52:46.329 --> 00:52:47.731

THAT THIS DOCUMENT DOES NOT

THAT.

01:03:28.671 --> 01:03:30.006
THE WELL PUBLICIZED IDEAS THAT

01:03:30.072 --> 01:03:30.606
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT VERY

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:32.074
MUCH SO CERTAINLY -- AND ALSO

01:03:32.141 --> 01:03:33.209
JUST ONE ANOTHER THIS IS NOT --

01:03:33.276 --> 01:03:34.544
NOR IS THIS THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE

01:03:34.610 --> 01:03:36.812
OF VARIOUS BUDGET ACTIONS OUR

THIS IS JUST SORT OF SOME OF THE

I THINK -- COMMITTEE STAFF AND I

01:03:41.117 --> 01:03:41.684
WORK WERE JOKING THAT IS KIND OF

01:03:41.751 --> 01:03:42.585
LIKE THE OLD DAVID LETTERMAN TOP

01:03:42.652 --> 01:03:43.452

TICKET ITEMS THAT WAS DAVID

01:03:47.490 --> 01:03:51.027
LETTERMAN ABOUT.

01:03:51.093 --> 01:03:52.161
THESE BOOKS ARE NOT AS OLD AND A

01:03:52.228 --> 01:03:53.629
YES.

01:03:53.696 --> 01:03:54.430
SO.

01:03:54.497 --> 01:03:57.133
HAPPY TO WALK THROUGH THIS.

01:03:57.200 --> 01:03:58.834
WITH INTERESTED YES PLEASE RIGHT.

01:03:58.901 --> 01:03:59.735
SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE KEY

01:03:59.802 --> 01:04:00.670
COMPONENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN

01:04:00.736 --> 01:04:02.138
DISCUSSING IN RECENT YEARS WITH

01:04:02.205 --> 01:04:03.339
REGARDS TO CAL GRANT.

01:04:03.406 --> 01:04:04.974
IS THE ACCESS WORK COMPONENT OF

01:04:05.041 --> 01:04:07.310
OUR CAL GRANT THE PROGRAM THIS

01:04:07.376 --> 01:04:09.679
IS THE STATE'S MAIN -- FINANCIAL

01:04:09.745 --> 01:04:10.880
AID AWARD THAT COVERS NON

01:04:10.947 --> 01:04:12.882
TUITION EXPENSES FOR LOW INCOME

01:04:12.949 --> 01:04:15.418
STUDENTS -- IT IS -- IT'S

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:16.619
ACTUALLY THE ME THE ONLY CAL

01:04:16.686 --> 01:04:18.020
GRANT AWARD THAT COMMUNITY

01:04:18.087 --> 01:04:19.288
COLLEGE STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.123
SENSORS NO TUITION CHARGE FOR

01:04:21.190 --> 01:04:23.759
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE

01:04:23.826 --> 01:04:25.228
ECONOMY ACCESS THE WORD WHICH

01:04:25.294 --> 01:04:26.963
SERVES -- OVER A QUARTER OF A

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:29.565
MILLION STUDENTS HAS NOT KEPT UP

01:04:29.632 --> 01:04:31.400
WITH INFLATION IT WAS FIRST

01:04:31.467 --> 01:04:32.068
INSTITUTED IN THE LATE NINETEEN

01:04:32.134 --> 01:04:35.071
SIXTIES AT NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS --

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:36.939
IN NINETEEN SIXTY TO NINETEEN

01:04:37.006 --> 01:04:37.573
SIXTY NINE DOLLARS SO WOULD BE

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:39.208
WORTH MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND

01:04:39.275 --> 01:04:40.810
DOLLARS PER YEAR TODAY IF IT

01:04:40.876 --> 01:04:41.777
KEPT UP WITH INFLATION.

01:04:41.844 --> 01:04:44.080
IT'S CURRENTLY SET AT ONE

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:44.714
THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED FORTY EIGHT

01:04:44.780 --> 01:04:45.581
DOLLARS SO IT'S WORTH ABOUT A

01:04:45.648 --> 01:04:47.316
QUARTER OF WHAT IT WOULD BE SO

01:04:47.383 --> 01:04:49.518
WHAT WE DID IS WE JUST SORT OF

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:50.720
LOOKED AT SOME COST ESTIMATES IF

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.288
THE AWARD WERE TO BE INCREASED

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:54.223
TO TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS. TO

01:04:54.290 --> 01:04:54.857
TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS NO

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:57.026
ORDER THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND

01:04:57.093 --> 01:04:58.294
QUITE CANDIDLY MISTER CHAIR THIS

01:04:58.361 --> 01:05:01.864
IS A THIS IS NOT A LOW COST --

01:05:01.931 --> 01:05:03.332
LOW LIFT ITEM EVEN INCREASING IT

01:05:03.399 --> 01:05:05.001
BY A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS TO TWO

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.702
THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD COST A

01:05:06.769 --> 01:05:07.703
LITTLE OVER A HUNDRED MILLION

01:05:07.770 --> 01:05:10.773
DOLLARS -- IN ANNUAL FUNDS --

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.307
AND ABOUT THE WHAT'S DALY

01:05:11.374 --> 01:05:12.541
INCREASE YEAR OVER YEAR AS THE

01:05:12.608 --> 01:05:14.110
NUMBER OF STUDENTS RECEIVING THE

01:05:14.176 --> 01:05:16.112
AWARD INCREASES BUT AS I SAID

01:05:16.178 --> 01:05:18.281
THIS IS THE PRIMARY FORM OF NON

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:20.983
TUITION SUPPORT MEANING SUPPORT.

01:05:21.050 --> 01:05:23.119
FOR TEXTBOOKS SUPPLIES LIVING

01:05:23.185 --> 01:05:24.387
EXPENSES AT CETERA THAT THE

01:05:24.453 --> 01:05:25.655
STATE PROVIDES THROUGH THE CAL

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.056
GRANT PROGRAM.

01:05:27.123 --> 01:05:28.724
SO -- WE THINK IT WOULD PAY

01:05:28.791 --> 01:05:35.598
SIGNIFICANT DIVIDENDS BUT AGAIN --

01:05:35.665 --> 01:05:40.136
NOT A LOW COST.

01:05:40.202 --> 01:05:43.739
MOVING ON SURE AND THE THIS

01:05:43.806 --> 01:05:44.774
WOULD BE FROM THIS.

01:05:44.840 --> 01:05:46.409
IS KIND OF GOING TO COMING TO

01:05:46.475 --> 01:05:47.143
THE END.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:48.010
THIS WOULD BE.

01:05:48.077 --> 01:05:51.547
THE MOST COSTLY I BELIEVE SO.

01:05:51.614 --> 01:05:52.548
YEAH OVERALLTHOUGH DEPENDING ON

01:05:52.615 --> 01:05:55.117
SOME OF THE SOME OF THE OPTIONS

01:05:55.184 --> 01:05:57.320
BUT YES BY AND LARGE.

01:05:57.386 --> 01:05:58.621
SO THE OTHER THING WE TALKED

01:05:58.688 --> 01:06:00.122
ABOUT AND THAT YOU MENTION AT

01:06:00.189 --> 01:06:01.223
THE BEGINNING OF THE HEARING --

01:06:01.290 --> 01:06:03.025
CHAIR MCCARTY IS THE NOTION OF

01:06:03.092 --> 01:06:04.093
SORT OF CLOSING UP SOME OF THE

01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.461
GAPS IN OUR CURRENT STATE

01:06:05.528 --> 01:06:07.897
FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM -- AGAIN

01:06:07.963 --> 01:06:10.199
CAL GRANT BEING -- ARGUABLY THE

01:06:10.266 --> 01:06:11.534
MOST GENEROUS IN PROGRESS OF

01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:12.501
FINANCIAL AID SYSTEM IN THE

01:06:12.568 --> 01:06:13.636
COUNTRY THERE ARE STILL A LOT OF

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.237
STUDENTS THAT ARE LEFT OUT THAT

01:06:15.304 --> 01:06:18.307
HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL NEED

01:06:18.374 --> 01:06:19.408
THAT -- IT CERTAINLY APPEARS

01:06:19.475 --> 01:06:21.110
WERE INTENDED TO BE SERVED BY

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:23.045
THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM BUT THANKS

01:06:23.112 --> 01:06:24.347

IN BUILT IN OVER THE YEARS HAVE

01:06:25.581 --> 01:06:28.017
BEEN -- UNINTENTIONALLY LEFT OUT

01:06:28.084 --> 01:06:30.386
AND SO -- FOR EXAMPLE THANKS TO

01:06:30.453 --> 01:06:31.354
THE FACT THAT CAL GRANT A AND

01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.855
CAL GRANT BE HAVE DIFFERENT GPA

01:06:32.922 --> 01:06:34.857
REQUIREMENTS BUT ALSO DIFFERING

01:06:34.924 --> 01:06:36.559
INCOME CEILINGS A LOT OF

01:06:36.625 --> 01:06:39.995
STUDENTS -- WHO HAVE WHAT IN

01:06:40.062 --> 01:06:41.297
CALIFORNIA WOULD YOU KNOW NATION

01:06:41.364 --> 01:06:42.832
WIDE MIGHT BE CONSIDERED MIDDLE

01:06:42.898 --> 01:06:44.266
INCOME BUT IN CALIFORNIA --

01:06:44.333 --> 01:06:46.469
HARDLY MIDDLE CLASS FIFTY FOUR

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:47.803
THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ABOUT A

01:06:47.870 --> 01:06:48.371
HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN

01:06:48.437 --> 01:06:49.772
INCOME -- DON'T RECEIVE ANY CAL

01:06:49.839 --> 01:06:51.774
GRANT AT ALL EVEN THOUGH THEY

MAY HAVE A GPA CLOSE TO THREE

01:06:53.609 --> 01:06:54.710
POINT NO THEY MAY GET INTO ONE

01:06:54.777 --> 01:06:56.812
OF OUR CS YOU WERE UC CAMPUSES

01:06:56.879 --> 01:06:58.180
ONE OF OUR QUALIFYING PRIVATE

01:06:58.247 --> 01:06:59.648
INSTITUTIONS.

01:06:59.715 --> 01:07:01.851
BUT BECAUSE OF THIS GAP DUE TO

01:07:01.917 --> 01:07:02.918
THE DIFFERENT GPA IN INCOME

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:04.353
CEILINGS DON'T GET ANY CAL GRANT

01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:05.588
IT WHATSOEVER.

01:07:05.654 --> 01:07:07.189
AND SO THAT'S A CLOSE TO TEN

01:07:07.256 --> 01:07:08.891
THOUSAND STUDENTS STATEWIDE --

01:07:08.958 --> 01:07:10.960
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER AND AT A COST

01:07:11.026 --> 01:07:12.962
OF ABOUT FORTY EIGHT MILLION --

01:07:13.028 --> 01:07:14.563
OR ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTEEN

01:07:14.630 --> 01:07:15.531
MILLION ON GOING WINNER NEW ALL

01:07:15.598 --> 01:07:16.632
STUDENTS ARE FACTORED IN THAT

01:07:16.699 --> 01:07:18.267
GAP COULD BE CLOSED UP SORT OF

01:07:18.334 --> 01:07:20.202
HELPING US BUILD A UNIFIED

01:07:20.269 --> 01:07:24.573
STREAMLINED.

01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.742
CAL GRANT SYSTEM.

01:07:26.809 --> 01:07:28.711
ANOTHER PROVISION THAT -- WAS --

01:07:28.778 --> 01:07:30.012
THAT HAS BEEN A LAW FOR ABOUT

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:30.613
FORTY YEARS NOW THAT WE DON'T

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:32.381
KNOW DISCUSS MUCH BUT WITH IS

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:33.215
SORT OF PART OF OUR VISION FOR

01:07:33.282 --> 01:07:34.450
UNIFIED CAL GRANT SYSTEM.

01:07:34.517 --> 01:07:36.552
IS A PROVISION IN OUR CAL GRANT

01:07:36.619 --> 01:07:38.554
BE CODE FOR YOU KNOW WHATEVER

01:07:38.621 --> 01:07:40.256
REASON SAYS THAT STUDENTS TO GET

01:07:40.322 --> 01:07:41.824
A CAL GRANT BE AND GO TO ONE OF

01:07:41.891 --> 01:07:43.325
OUR FOUR YEAR SCHOOLS THAT'S THE

01:07:43.392 --> 01:07:44.727
UC A CSU.

01:07:44.794 --> 01:07:46.495
OR A PRIVATE NONPROFIT OR FOR

01:07:46.562 --> 01:07:48.330
PROFIT INSTITUTION DON'T GET A

01:07:48.397 --> 01:07:49.331
TUITION AWARD IN THEIR FIRST

01:07:49.398 --> 01:07:50.733
YEAR THE GET IN YEARS TWO THREE

01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:52.568
OR FOUR BUT IN THEIR FIRST YEAR

01:07:52.635 --> 01:07:53.602
THEY ONLY GET THAT ACCESS THE

01:07:53.669 --> 01:07:55.237
WAR THAT SUPPORT FOR BOOKS AND

01:07:55.304 --> 01:07:55.938
SUPPLIES.

01:07:56.005 --> 01:07:56.972
AND AS FAR AS WERE ABLE TO TELL

01:07:57.039 --> 01:07:58.607
THAT WAS BUILT ON OUTDATED

01:07:58.674 --> 01:07:59.809
PROVISION OF LAW BACK IN THE DAY

01:07:59.875 --> 01:08:01.544
THAT ASSUME THAT LOW INCOME

01:08:01.610 --> 01:08:03.746
STUDENTS WOULD OVER WHEN WE GO

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.014
TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE FIRST AND

01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.182
THEN THE ANSWER FOR NOW IS THAT

01:08:06.248 --> 01:08:07.716
A BETTER DEAL WHEN TUITION WAS

01:08:07.783 --> 01:08:08.184
LOWER.

01:08:08.250 --> 01:08:09.819
CERTAINLY PEOPLE MADE THE CHOICE

01:08:09.885 --> 01:08:12.154
TO ACTUALLY TRACK THAT BUT NOW

01:08:12.221 --> 01:08:13.088
BUT EVERY YEARS THAT I VISION

01:08:13.155 --> 01:08:16.125
HAS BECOME OUTDATED AND ARGUABLY

01:08:16.192 --> 01:08:17.092
GIVEN THE STATE'S YEAH OUT

01:08:17.159 --> 01:08:18.727
SUPPORT FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS

01:08:18.794 --> 01:08:19.929
ATTENDING COLLEGE -- AN

01:08:19.995 --> 01:08:21.530
OFFENSIVE PROVISIONED YOUR TO

01:08:21.597 --> 01:08:23.065
HAVE -- IN OUR FINANCIAL AID

01:08:23.132 --> 01:08:24.567
SYSTEM ASSUMING THAT LOW INCOME

01:08:24.633 --> 01:08:29.438
STUDENTS WILL AUTOMATICALLY GO

01:08:29.505 --> 01:08:31.740
EXCLUSIVELY TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:08:31.807 --> 01:08:32.374
ARE THE THIRD NOT WORTHY QUOTE

01:08:32.441 --> 01:08:33.642
UNQUOTE OF GOING TO A FOUR YEAR

01:08:33.709 --> 01:08:33.976
INSTITUTION.

01:08:34.043 --> 01:08:34.610
SO THERE'S A KIND OF TO THE BIG

01:08:34.677 --> 01:08:36.111
YOU KNOW GAPS THAT WE TALK ABOUT

01:08:36.178 --> 01:08:38.047
OUR HOLES -- AGAIN BOTH OF WHICH

01:08:38.113 --> 01:08:40.015
CARRIED A SIGNIFICANT PRICE TAG

01:08:40.082 --> 01:08:41.650
OVER A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.886
ANNUALLY TO CLOSE ON AND WE KNOW

01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:44.820
THAT IN THE CASE OF THAT CAL

01:08:44.887 --> 01:08:46.222
GRANT THE PROVISION THAT I JUST

01:08:46.288 --> 01:08:48.657
MENTIONED -- OUR PUBLIC

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:50.359
INSTITUTIONS -- TO APPEAR BE

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.627
COVERING MOST OF THE STUDENTS

01:08:51.694 --> 01:08:53.095
WITH THEIR INSTITUTIONALLY BASED

01:08:53.162 --> 01:08:55.364
FINANCIAL AID ON ANNUAL BASIS SO

01:08:55.431 --> 01:08:56.765
FORTUNATELY DOES NOT SEEM OF

01:08:56.832 --> 01:08:57.800
THERE'S A LOT OF STUDENTS IN

01:08:57.867 --> 01:08:59.301
THAT PARTICULAR PROVISION THAT

01:08:59.368 --> 01:09:00.703
ARE NOT GETTING THE TUITION

01:09:00.769 --> 01:09:00.970
SUPPORT.

01:09:01.036 --> 01:09:02.304
IT'S JUST THAT IT'S PART OF A

01:09:02.371 --> 01:09:03.672
VERY COMPLEX AND DIFFICULT TO

01:09:03.739 --> 01:09:05.341
UNDERSTAND SYSTEM WHEN THEY'RE

01:09:05.407 --> 01:09:06.509
TUITION SUPPORT IS COMING PARTLY

01:09:06.575 --> 01:09:07.643
FROM THE STATE PARTY FROM THE

01:09:07.710 --> 01:09:09.678
INSTITUTION AND THEN AFTER YOUR

01:09:09.745 --> 01:09:10.179
ONE IT'S WHICH IS FROM

01:09:10.246 --> 01:09:12.615
INSTITUTIONAL AID TO STATE A AND

01:09:12.681 --> 01:09:14.250
REALLY -- UNIFIED STREAMLINED

01:09:14.316 --> 01:09:18.120
SYSTEM MIGHT COVER TUITION FOR

01:09:18.187 --> 01:09:18.954
ALL STUDENTS FOR FOUR YEARS

01:09:19.021 --> 01:09:19.255
[inaudible]

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:22.958
OKAY -- FINALLY ON THIS PAGE.

01:09:23.025 --> 01:09:25.127
TWO MORE PAGES -- ON PAGE TWO WE

01:09:25.194 --> 01:09:25.761
HAVE SOME -- COST ESTIMATES ARE

01:09:25.828 --> 01:09:26.729
INCREASING THE NUMBER OF

01:09:26.795 --> 01:09:28.330
COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT AWARDS AND

01:09:28.397 --> 01:09:30.266
SO WE JUST LOOK AT WHAT A COST

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:31.867
PER AN EXTRA.

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:32.668
FIVE THOUSAND AWARDS EVERY YEAR

01:09:32.735 --> 01:09:34.103
SO ADDING FIVE THOUSAND

01:09:34.169 --> 01:09:35.905
ADDITIONAL WORDS ABOUT ELEVEN

01:09:35.971 --> 01:09:37.540
MILLION AT THE CURRENT RATE BUT

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.675
WE ALSO LOOK AT IF THE CAL GRANT.

01:09:39.742 --> 01:09:41.076
ACCESS THE WAR WERE TO BE

01:09:41.143 --> 01:09:42.044
INCREASED WHAT THAT WOULD COST

01:09:42.111 --> 01:09:43.412
BECAUSE THAT SORT OF HAS A

01:09:43.479 --> 01:09:44.246
COMPOUNDING EFFECT.

01:09:44.313 --> 01:09:46.415
SO AN ADDITIONAL IF YOU LOOK AT

01:09:46.482 --> 01:09:48.884
THE BOTTOM RIGHT AN ADDITIONAL --

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.719
FIVE THOUSAND AWARDS FOR YEARS

01:09:50.786 --> 01:09:54.456
OUT WOULD COST ABOUT TWENTY

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:55.024
THREE MILLION DOLLARS AT THE

01:09:55.090 --> 01:09:56.525
THREE THOUSAND RATE.

01:09:56.592 --> 01:09:58.294
SO THOSE ARE DONE -- PER STAFF

01:09:58.360 --> 01:09:59.361
REQUEST TO SORT OF LOOK AT THE

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:01.163
KIND OF COMPOUNDING -- COST

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.098
SCORING.

01:10:03.165 --> 01:10:05.434
TOP OF PAGE -- THREE ONE OF THE

01:10:05.501 --> 01:10:06.869
THINGS THAT -- ARE COMMISSION

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.270
HAS SUPPORTIVE IN RECENT YEARS

01:10:08.337 --> 01:10:10.039
HAS BEEN REMOVING BARRIERS TO

01:10:10.105 --> 01:10:11.340
STUDENTS GETTING A TRANSFER

01:10:11.407 --> 01:10:13.008
ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT SO THE

01:10:13.075 --> 01:10:14.410
TRANSFER ENTITLEMENT CAL GRANT

01:10:14.476 --> 01:10:15.311
IN OUR VIEW.

01:10:15.377 --> 01:10:17.813
IS -- ONE OF THE SORT OF LESSER

01:10:17.880 --> 01:10:19.014
KNOWN IN MAY BE LESSER

01:10:19.081 --> 01:10:22.251
PUBLICIZED BUT REALLY -- MORE --

01:10:22.318 --> 01:10:23.452
ADVANTAGEOUS PROVISIONS WERE

01:10:23.519 --> 01:10:25.187
FINANCIALLY SYSTEM THE TRANSFER

IT HAS AN AGE LIMIT AGE TWENTY

01:10:52.181 --> 01:10:53.115
EIGHT AS YOU ARE REFERENCE

01:10:53.182 --> 01:10:54.717
EARLIER CHAIR SO.

01:10:54.783 --> 01:10:56.318
THAT LEAVES OUT QUITE A FEW

01:10:56.385 --> 01:10:57.786
STUDENTS SEVERAL THOUSAND

01:10:57.853 --> 01:10:59.688
STUDENTS WHO ATTEND COMMUNITY

01:10:59.755 --> 01:11:00.923

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:05.794
NOTION OF THE TODAY'S STUDENT

01:11:05.861 --> 01:11:06.629
MEDIA DEMOGRAPHIC OF TODAY'S

01:11:06.695 --> 01:11:08.364
STUDENT SO WHAT WE'VE DONE IS

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:09.732
SOME COST CALCULATIONS FOR IF WE

01:11:09.798 --> 01:11:11.066
WERE TO LIFT THAT AGE LIMIT TO

01:11:11.133 --> 01:11:12.067
AGE.

01:11:12.134 --> 01:11:13.035
THIRTY ABOUT THIRTY MILLION

01:11:13.102 --> 01:11:15.104
DOLLARS IT'S THIRTY FIVE BY

01:11:15.170 --> 01:11:15.838
FIFTY SEVEN MILLION.

01:11:15.904 --> 01:11:17.272
EACH FORTY ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

01:11:17.339 --> 01:11:18.140
MILLION AND THEN JUST TO SAY NO

01:11:18.207 --> 01:11:20.442
AGE RESTRICTION ANY STUDENT WHO

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:21.744
ATTENDS A CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

COLLEGE TRANSFERS MEETS OUR GPA

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:26.582
AND ARE -- APPLICATION

01:11:26.649 --> 01:11:28.684
REQUIREMENTS WOULD GET THAT CAL

01:11:29.351 --> 01:11:30.119
THEY TRANSFER.

01:11:30.185 --> 01:11:31.453
SO THAT'S KIND OF PART OF OUR

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:32.554
GENERAL PRINCIPLE OF REMOVING

01:11:32.621 --> 01:11:34.289
BARRIERS TO ELIGIBILITY AND

01:11:34.356 --> 01:11:35.724
ACCESS TO CAL GRANT IS SOMETHING

01:11:35.791 --> 01:11:37.693
THAT WE'VE BEEN EMPHASIZING FOR

01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:39.461
RECENT YEARS IN THAT -- THE

01:11:39.528 --> 01:11:40.396
LEGISLATION THAT YOU MISTER

01:11:45.901 --> 01:11:46.735
AS WELL.

01:11:46.802 --> 01:11:49.238
FINALLY ON THIS PAGE THERE'S ONE

01:11:49.304 --> 01:11:50.372
MORE ITEM AFTER THE FINALLY ON

01:11:50.439 --> 01:11:50.973
PAGE THREE AND LEADING ON THE

01:11:51.040 --> 01:11:51.173
PAGE.

01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.608
FOR SOME OF A LOOK AT THE HIGH

01:11:52.675 --> 01:11:55.044
SCHOOL ENTITLEMENT WINDOW SO AS

01:11:55.110 --> 01:11:56.512

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.148
DISCUSSION.

01:11:59.214 --> 01:12:00.683
PRIMARILY HINGES ON HOW LONG IT

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:01.650
HAS BEEN SINCE A STUDENT

01:12:01.717 --> 01:12:03.719
GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL ONE OF THE

01:12:03.786 --> 01:12:04.887
MOST PROGRESSIVE STEPS THIS

01:12:04.953 --> 01:12:07.456
LEGISLATURE TOOK IN.

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.791
TWO THOUSAND IN AN ACTING --

01:12:08.857 --> 01:12:11.093
SENATE BILL SIXTEEN FORTY FOUR

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.561
THE VASCONCELOS PARTICULAR TEASE

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.697
CAL GRANT ACT WAS IN SAYING THAT

01:12:14.763 --> 01:12:15.931

01:12:20.703 --> 01:12:23.038
GPA AND INCOME REQUIREMENTS

01:12:23.105 --> 01:12:24.707
HOWEVER AGAIN AS WE'VE BEEN

01:12:24.773 --> 01:12:27.109
DISCUSSING FOR MORE STUDENTS ARE.

01:12:27.176 --> 01:12:28.110
FOR YOU KNOW OFTEN PERFECTLY

01:12:28.177 --> 01:12:29.712
VALID REASONS TAKING A LITTLE

01:12:29.778 --> 01:12:31.947
LONGER TO ATTEND COLLEGE OR

01:12:32.014 --> 01:12:33.248
ATTENDING A LITTLE BIT LATER

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:34.516
INTO THEIR TWENTIES OR LATER.

01:12:34.583 --> 01:12:35.851
AND SO WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:36.585
AND FOR THOSE STUDENTS THERE

01:12:36.652 --> 01:12:37.753
PRIMARILY SERVE BY THE

01:12:37.820 --> 01:12:39.121
COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS

01:12:39.188 --> 01:12:41.724
SINCE -- THAT IS -- THAT'S THE

01:12:41.790 --> 01:12:43.325
STATE'S PRIMARY VEHICLE FOR

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:44.660
SERVING THE QUOTE UNQUOTE ADULT

01:12:44.727 --> 01:12:46.261
LEARNER POPULATION SO WE'VE BEEN

01:12:46.328 --> 01:12:48.197
TALKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT IT

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:49.498
WOULD MAKE SENSE TO SORT OF ADD

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:51.300
SOME TIME TO THAT WINDOW SAY.

01:12:51.366 --> 01:12:52.768
CAL GRANT TO ENTITLEMENT FOR TWO

01:12:52.835 --> 01:12:54.036
YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL THREE

01:12:54.103 --> 01:12:55.504
YEARS AFTER HIGH SCHOOL FIVE

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.206
YEARS OUT OF HIGH SCHOOL AND

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:58.707
THIS ACTUALLY WILL WOULD CUT

01:12:58.774 --> 01:13:00.375
INTO THE COMPETITIVE CAL GRANT

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:02.010
PROGRAM AND IF YOU'RE A REDUCE

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:02.878
THAT SORT OF PRESSURE.

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.546
AND DEMAND ON THE COMPETITIVE

ONE YEAR TO MAKE IT COVER AN

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:12.121
ANTI ONE FOR TWO YEARS AT A HIGH

01:13:12.187 --> 01:13:13.455
SCHOOL WOULD COST APPROXIMATELY

01:13:13.522 --> 01:13:15.357
THIRTY SIX MILLION. TO MAKE IT

01:13:15.424 --> 01:13:15.958
THREE YEARS GOES UP

01:13:16.024 --> 01:13:17.025
SIGNIFICANTLY NINETY SEVEN

01:13:17.092 --> 01:13:19.561
MILLION AND TO MAKE IT IN TIME

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:20.496
FOR FIVE YEARS OUT OF HIGH

01:13:20.562 --> 01:13:22.431
SCHOOL YOU SEE ON PAGE. FOUR TWO

01:13:22.498 --> 01:13:23.065
HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION BUT

01:13:23.132 --> 01:13:25.701
AGAIN THAT WOULD IN TURN REDUCE

01:13:25.768 --> 01:13:26.935
SOME OF THE PRESSURE IN DEMAND

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:28.337
ON THE COMPETITIVE CAL THAT

01:13:28.403 --> 01:13:29.705

01:13:34.176 --> 01:13:34.710
VERSUS INCREASING THE NUMBER

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:36.545
COMPETITIVE CAL GRANTS AVAILABLE

01:13:36.612 --> 01:13:42.417

FINANCIALLY THE ONE THING THAT

WE DIDN'T HAVE ON HERE.

01:15:50.712 --> 01:15:52.881
THE WHICH IS IMPORTANT TO US IS

THE NON TUITIONS CERTAINLY AND

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:08.130
AND WE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSING THAT

01:16:08.196 --> 01:16:09.598
WITH COMMITTEE STAFF AS WELL

01:16:09.665 --> 01:16:10.432
THAT WAS A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO

01:16:10.499 --> 01:16:12.134
SCORE -- BECAUSE IT SORT OF

01:16:12.200 --> 01:16:13.835
DEPENDS ON THE I THINK WHAT

01:16:13.902 --> 01:16:14.937
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THE

01:16:15.003 --> 01:16:16.838
NOTION THAT WE WOULD CONSOLIDATE

01:16:16.905 --> 01:16:18.173
CAL GRANT AB AND C. A MIDDLE

01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:19.741
CLASS SCHOLARSHIP HAVE ONE CAL

01:16:19.808 --> 01:16:20.542
GRANT TO SOME.

01:16:20.609 --> 01:16:21.376
AND HAVE THE WORDS KIND OF

01:16:21.443 --> 01:16:23.078
TAPERED DOWN AS THE STUDENTS

01:16:23.145 --> 01:16:24.813
INCOME GOES UP -- IF I RECALL

01:16:24.880 --> 01:16:26.148
CORRECTLY AND HELP YOU SOME

01:16:26.214 --> 01:16:28.317
SUPPORT FOR NON TUITION EXPENSES

01:16:28.383 --> 01:16:30.752
THE JUST SORT OF GOES SCALED

01:16:30.819 --> 01:16:35.557
DOWN AS AS THE STUDENT INCOME OR

01:16:35.624 --> 01:16:37.225
NEED YOU KNOW YEAH RACES -- NOPE

01:16:37.292 --> 01:16:38.327
WOULD WANT TO TAPER DOWN THAT

01:16:38.393 --> 01:16:40.195
SAID POLICY DISCUSSION BUT HER

01:16:40.262 --> 01:16:45.200
POTENTIALLY TAPER AT TAPERED UP.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.635
TO COVER THE THAT THE NON

01:16:46.702 --> 01:16:48.603
TUITION COSTS SPECIALLY FOR THE

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:48.971
LOWEST INCOME.

01:16:49.037 --> 01:16:50.539
SURE YEAH AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:51.940
WORKING ON THAT I THINK IT JUST

01:16:52.007 --> 01:16:53.942
DEPENDS ON THE MODEL THAT'S USED

01:16:54.009 --> 01:16:56.011
BUT WE CAN CONTINUE WORKING WITH

01:16:56.078 --> 01:16:58.513
ALL OF THE ROUTE.

01:16:58.580 --> 01:16:59.781
THAT WIND THE THE BALLPARK -- SO

01:16:59.848 --> 01:17:01.016
ARE YOU ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

01:17:01.083 --> 01:17:03.518
HAVING LIKE -- LIKE SETTING THAT

01:17:03.585 --> 01:17:05.120
NON TUITION AWARD WILL BE CALLED

01:17:05.187 --> 01:17:06.788
THE CAL GRANT BE AXIS WARD AT

01:17:06.855 --> 01:17:07.622
ABOUT LIKE LIKE UP YEARS AGO WE

01:17:07.689 --> 01:17:09.291
DID THERE ARE.

01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:11.526
DEBT FREE COLLEGE SURE GRANTS

01:17:11.593 --> 01:17:12.694
WHERE'D.

01:17:12.761 --> 01:17:16.765
I THINK IT WAS ROUGHLY. FIFTY

01:17:16.832 --> 01:17:17.466
THREE THOUSAND AND EIGHT

01:17:17.532 --> 01:17:19.167
THOUSAND THE AVERAGE CAL GRANT

01:17:19.234 --> 01:17:20.335
RECIPIENT WILL RECEIVE.

01:17:20.402 --> 01:17:22.270
THIS AMOUNT IN ADDITION EVERY

01:17:22.337 --> 01:17:24.339
YEAR -- FOR FOR NON TUITION

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:26.208
COSTS.

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:28.610
SO TO DO THAT SORT OF SYSTEM

01:17:28.677 --> 01:17:30.879
WHICH I THINK REPRESENTS A

01:17:30.946 --> 01:17:31.980
PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL.

01:17:32.047 --> 01:17:32.848
WOULD BE ROUGHLY IN THE

01:17:32.914 --> 01:17:34.149
NEIGHBORHOOD OF ONE AND A HALF

01:17:34.216 --> 01:17:34.983
TO TWO BILLION AND THAT'S A

01:17:35.050 --> 01:17:36.218
PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE OVERHAUL

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:37.786
THAT INVOLVES IF I'M IF I'M

01:17:37.853 --> 01:17:39.554
UNDERSTANDING CORRECTLY THE SORT

01:17:39.621 --> 01:17:40.055
OF MODEL WHERE THERE'S A

01:17:40.122 --> 01:17:41.690
EXPECTED STUDENT CONTRIBUTION%

01:17:41.757 --> 01:17:43.392
FROM WORKER LOANS.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:44.559
AND THEN FEDERAL INSTITUTIONAL

01:17:44.626 --> 01:17:46.194
STATED WILL COMBINE TO MEET THE

01:17:46.261 --> 01:17:46.895
REMAINDER OF THE COST OF

01:17:46.962 --> 01:17:48.497
ATTENDANCE AND FOR THOSE LOW

01:17:48.563 --> 01:17:49.931
INCOME HIGHER NEED STUDENTS THAT

01:17:49.998 --> 01:17:51.299
GRANT WILL BE.

01:17:51.366 --> 01:17:53.035
A LITTLE HIGHER TO ENSURE THAT

01:17:53.101 --> 01:17:54.169
THEIR COST OF ATTENDANCE IS

01:17:54.236 --> 01:17:55.704
COVERED I'VE SEEN VARIOUS MODELS

01:17:55.771 --> 01:17:58.507
OF THAT IN THE ONE AND A HALF TO

01:17:58.573 --> 01:17:59.341
TWO BILLION DOLLAR RANGE.

01:17:59.408 --> 01:18:03.345
YES THAT'S OBVIOUSLY THE LARGEST --

01:18:03.412 --> 01:18:04.713
DOLLAR SIGN ON THESE PROPOSAL SO

01:18:04.780 --> 01:18:06.715
IF YOU ADD UP.

01:18:06.782 --> 01:18:08.617
ALL THESE PROPOSALS AND AND

01:18:08.683 --> 01:18:10.886
LET'S SAY -- THE MOST COST

01:18:10.952 --> 01:18:13.255
EFFICIENT.

01:18:13.321 --> 01:18:14.189
CHOICE ON HERE AND SOME OF THE

01:18:14.256 --> 01:18:16.792
ONES WE HAVE MULTIPLE OPTIONS IS

01:18:16.858 --> 01:18:19.061
WHO IS WITHIN THE LOW COUPLE

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:20.762
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR RANGE

01:18:20.829 --> 01:18:21.263
SACKED.

01:18:21.329 --> 01:18:23.331
THAT'S THE ESSENTIALLY VIABLE

01:18:23.398 --> 01:18:23.532
FEET.

01:18:23.598 --> 01:18:25.667
IF YOU DID A A MULTI YEAR

01:18:25.734 --> 01:18:26.968
IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT.

01:18:27.035 --> 01:18:28.370
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK

01:18:28.437 --> 01:18:30.772
WE WILL BE EVALUATING I GUESS I

01:18:30.839 --> 01:18:32.808
I KNOW SOME MY COLLEAGUES HE HAS

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:33.542
SOME QUESTIONS HERE.

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:35.277
TO ABOUT ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT

01:18:35.343 --> 01:18:38.947
I I'VE ALWAYS GRAPPLE WITH.

01:18:39.014 --> 01:18:40.248
AND IT'S IT'S KIND OF BACK TO

01:18:40.315 --> 01:18:40.649
THE FIRST ISSUE.

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:42.551
IS IF YOU IF YOU HAVE A CERTAIN

01:18:42.617 --> 01:18:44.086
AMOUNT OF STUDENTS WHO ARE WHO

01:18:44.152 --> 01:18:45.420
ARE IN.

01:18:45.487 --> 01:18:47.956
THEY HAVE A ARE YOU BETTER OFF

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:49.791
GIVING THEM BETTER EIGHT ARE

01:18:49.858 --> 01:18:51.159
HELPING THE STUDENTS WHO DIDN'T

01:18:51.226 --> 01:18:52.461
GET A IN THE FIRST PLACE.

01:18:52.527 --> 01:18:54.029

PEOPLE WHO HAVE A CAL GRANT.

01:18:56.565 --> 01:18:58.733
AWARD MAYBE IT SAID INSUFFICIENT

01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.202
ARE INFERIOR WORD THE ACCESS

01:19:00.268 --> 01:19:01.603
GRANTS AREN'T LOW ENOUGH WE

01:19:01.670 --> 01:19:02.871
DON'T COVER.

01:19:02.938 --> 01:19:04.806
TUITION THE FIRST YEAR BUT

01:19:04.873 --> 01:19:07.742
THEY'RE GETTING AID AND SO MANY

01:19:07.809 --> 01:19:08.510
STUDENTS ARE GETTING A AT ALL.

01:19:08.577 --> 01:19:11.613
THE COMPETITIVE -- STE THE US

01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:13.482
THE STUDENTS FOR PARTICULAR

01:19:13.548 --> 01:19:15.117
PEOPLE IN THAT DONNA HOLD SO FOR

01:19:15.183 --> 01:19:16.251
SO.

01:19:16.318 --> 01:19:18.253
WHO WHAT WHAT'S THE BIGGEST?

01:19:18.320 --> 01:19:20.355
BANG FOR YOUR BUCK IF YOU COULD --

01:19:20.422 --> 01:19:22.924
OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO DO BOTH AND

01:19:22.991 --> 01:19:23.525
I ASKED.

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.726
LAST YEAR WITH THE TO THIS

01:19:24.793 --> 01:19:25.961
QUESTION AND SHE ONE ANSWER SO

01:19:26.027 --> 01:19:27.362
IF YOU HAD.

01:19:27.429 --> 01:19:27.896
YOU KNOW A COUPLE HUNDRED

01:19:27.963 --> 01:19:30.465
MILLION DOLLARS HE IS CHOOSE ONE

01:19:30.532 --> 01:19:31.333
OF THE OTHER.

01:19:31.399 --> 01:19:34.136
WHAT WOULD YOU DO?

01:19:34.202 --> 01:19:35.470
IT'S GOING TO SOUND LIKE I'M

01:19:35.537 --> 01:19:36.505
HUNTING BUT WITH THE NEW

01:19:36.571 --> 01:19:37.072
EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR STARTING

01:19:37.139 --> 01:19:37.973
TOMORROW THIS THIS IS EITHER

01:19:38.039 --> 01:19:39.841
MIGHT.

01:19:39.908 --> 01:19:40.475
MY CHANCE OR I SHOULD KEEP MY

01:19:40.542 --> 01:19:42.310
MOUTH SHUT BUT I WOULD SAY IT

01:19:42.377 --> 01:19:43.712
DOESN'T NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE

01:19:43.778 --> 01:19:46.047
AN EITHER OR I WOULD SAY THAT --

01:19:46.114 --> 01:19:47.449
HE IN DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD WITH

01:19:47.516 --> 01:19:48.450
STAKEHOLDERS THIS DOESN'T

01:19:48.517 --> 01:19:49.851
REPRESENT LIKE AN OFFICIAL

01:19:49.918 --> 01:19:51.086
POSITION OF COMMISSIONS TAKEN

01:19:51.153 --> 01:19:52.220
BUT DISCUSSIONS OF HAVE A

01:19:52.287 --> 01:19:52.921
STAKEHOLDERS I THINK THAT

01:19:52.988 --> 01:19:54.856
INTERNALLY WE HAVE INCREASINGLY

01:19:54.923 --> 01:19:56.124
COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT.

01:19:56.191 --> 01:19:56.791
IT DOES NEED TO BE A LITTLE BIT

01:19:56.858 --> 01:19:59.161
ABOUT THAT WE WE DO NEED TO

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:00.729
PROVIDE BOTH MORE AID. FOR

01:20:00.795 --> 01:20:02.030
STUDENTS WHO ARE ALREADY IN THE

01:20:02.097 --> 01:20:04.065
SYSTEM BUT WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE

01:20:04.132 --> 01:20:04.900
THAT THERE ARE A WHOLE LOT OF

01:20:04.966 --> 01:20:06.668
STUDENTS THAT AREN'T EVEN IN

01:20:06.735 --> 01:20:08.103
DUTIES ELIGIBILITY.

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:09.838
THERE IS WE CREATED AND ON THAT

01:20:09.905 --> 01:20:11.006
LATTER POINT TO THE ELIGIBILITY

01:20:11.072 --> 01:20:12.607
BEARERS I THINK THAT'S WHERE YOU

01:20:12.674 --> 01:20:14.843
SEE -- YOU SEE A LOT OF

01:20:14.910 --> 01:20:16.745
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO

01:20:16.811 --> 01:20:18.013
ARE SERVED AS WELL BY THE

01:20:18.079 --> 01:20:19.381
CURRENT CAL GRANT ELIGIBILITY

01:20:19.447 --> 01:20:20.749
CRITERIA.

01:20:20.815 --> 01:20:22.784
AND THAT TO A LARGE EXTENT IS

01:20:22.851 --> 01:20:25.820
WHY -- I THINK WE'D LIKE TO SEE.

01:20:25.887 --> 01:20:28.089
YOU KNOW WHETHER IT'S FIFTY

01:20:28.156 --> 01:20:29.958
FIFTY OR OR CLOSE TO FIFTY FIFTY

01:20:30.025 --> 01:20:31.293
BUT SOME SOMETHING CLOSE EQUAL

01:20:31.359 --> 01:20:33.361
ATTENTION PAID TO OF BOTH THE

01:20:33.428 --> 01:20:36.498
BREATH VERSUS DEPTH THE IDEA

01:20:36.565 --> 01:20:37.632
THAT.

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:38.233
WE'D LIKE TO SEE MORE STUDENTS

01:20:38.300 --> 01:20:39.534
GET INTO THE FINANCIAL AID

01:20:39.601 --> 01:20:40.101
SYSTEM AND GET CAL GRANT TO

01:20:40.168 --> 01:20:41.069
BEGIN WITH BUT WOULD ALSO LIKE

01:20:41.136 --> 01:20:41.770
TO SEE THOSE THAT ARE GETTING IT.

01:20:41.836 --> 01:20:43.071
PARTICULARLY THOSE THAT HAVE THE

01:20:43.138 --> 01:20:44.739
HIGHEST NEEDHAM HEIGHTS COST GET

01:20:44.806 --> 01:20:46.308
MORE EIGHT YEAH BUT THE FLIP

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:48.143
SIDE OF THAT IF YOU TRY TO BE A

01:20:48.210 --> 01:20:50.679
LITTLE BIT. TO A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:53.148
YOU'RE NOTHING TO NOBODY.

01:20:53.215 --> 01:20:54.349
AND SO AND THERE'S THERE ARE

01:20:54.416 --> 01:20:55.951
SOME PIECES THAT YOU COULD JUST

01:20:56.017 --> 01:20:58.019
DO THE WHOLE THING.

01:20:58.086 --> 01:20:59.588
LIKE THAT THAT THAT THAT.

01:20:59.654 --> 01:21:00.755
DOES NOT HOLD THE STUDENTS TO

01:21:00.822 --> 01:21:03.191
HAVE INCOMES BETWEEN FIFTY AND A

01:21:03.258 --> 01:21:05.160
HUNDRED GRAND THAT HE PAYS JUST

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.595
BELOW THREE POINT OUT. TO TO

01:21:06.661 --> 01:21:12.267
CLOSE THAT HOLE IS WHAT. FORTY

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.201
EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS.

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:15.604
AND THEN THAT THE SUMMER SCHOOL --

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:17.172
PIECES LESS THAN TEN MILLION

01:21:17.239 --> 01:21:18.039
DOLLARS AND WE'RE NOT SURE IF

01:21:18.106 --> 01:21:20.609
THAT ACCURATE NUMBERS ON THAT.

01:21:20.675 --> 01:21:23.712
AND SO -- YOU KNOW TO INCREASING

01:21:23.778 --> 01:21:25.013
THE WINDOW FOR TWO YEARS FOR

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.715
ENTITLEMENTS THIRTY SIX MILLION

01:21:26.781 --> 01:21:27.148
CELL.

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:29.951
WOULD YOU WOULD YOU ADVISE DOING

01:21:30.018 --> 01:21:31.086
SOME OF THOSE ALL OF THEM AS

01:21:31.152 --> 01:21:33.955
OPPOSED TO SPREADING THEM OUT IF

01:21:34.022 --> 01:21:34.589
WE IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE AMOUNT

01:21:34.656 --> 01:21:37.225
TO DO A ALL TO GO ALL THE WAY.

01:21:37.292 --> 01:21:38.293
IN IN THAT.

01:21:38.360 --> 01:21:40.128
OUT OF THE GATE.

01:21:40.195 --> 01:21:41.529
I THINK THAT WOULD BE.

01:21:41.596 --> 01:21:43.098
I THINK THAT'S A THAT THAT WOULD

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:44.332
BE A FAIR ASSESSMENT YEAH THAT

01:21:44.399 --> 01:21:45.166
WE HAVE THERE THERE ARE

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:47.369
CERTAINLY SOME STEPS THAT -- IN

01:21:47.435 --> 01:21:49.070
THE INTEREST OF PURSUING A

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:50.839
SYSTEMIC BEYOND OVERHAUL OF A

01:21:50.905 --> 01:21:52.240
FINANCIALLY SYSTEM.

01:21:52.307 --> 01:21:53.541
THAT WE WOULD PROBABLY RECOMMEND

01:21:53.608 --> 01:21:57.379
BE DONE ALL AS ONE BUT THAT

01:21:57.445 --> 01:21:59.848
AGAIN IS A POLICY CALL AND AS I

01:21:59.914 --> 01:22:01.149
THINK WE DISCUSSED IN FEBRUARY

01:22:01.216 --> 01:22:02.450
THE FINANCIAL AID HEARING. TO A

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.052
LARGE EXTENT IT ALSO DEPENDS ON

01:22:04.119 --> 01:22:06.655
THE ON THE GOAL THE ON THE

01:22:06.721 --> 01:22:07.656
LEGISLATURE'S GOALS AND IF THE

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:08.923
GOAL IS.

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:10.392
TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF DEBT

01:22:10.458 --> 01:22:12.260
YOUNG STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH IS

01:22:12.327 --> 01:22:12.994
IF THE GOAL IS TO GET MORE

01:22:13.061 --> 01:22:15.096
STUDENTS YOU KNOW TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:15.163 --> 01:22:15.764
AFFORD IN A TOWN CALLED TO BEGIN

01:22:15.830 --> 01:22:19.334
WITH -- I THINK THAT -- OUR

01:22:19.401 --> 01:22:19.968
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO ONLY

01:22:20.035 --> 01:22:21.670
START SOME DISCUSSION OF WHAT

01:22:21.736 --> 01:22:23.405
THOSE GOALS ARE AND THEN SORT OF

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:24.906
FIGURE OUT WHICH PIECES OF THE

01:22:24.973 --> 01:22:26.741
FINANCIALLY REFORM WOULD BE MOST

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:27.342
EFFECTIVE IN MEETING THOSE.

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:29.244
WELL I I THINK OUR GOAL IS TWO

01:22:29.311 --> 01:22:31.179
FOLD AS YOU SAID EARLIER WE HAVE

01:22:31.246 --> 01:22:32.981
THIS CAL GRANT PROGRAM WHICH IS

01:22:33.048 --> 01:22:34.382
ONE OF THE AND THESE OF THE

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:36.851
NATION AS FAR AS OUR OUR EFFORTS

01:22:36.918 --> 01:22:38.286
IS NEARLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS A

01:22:38.353 --> 01:22:39.120
YEAR.

01:22:39.187 --> 01:22:42.557
WE SPENT ON ON FINANCIAL AID BUT

01:22:42.624 --> 01:22:43.158
WE NEED TO REALIZE TWO THINGS

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:44.426
THAT.

01:22:44.492 --> 01:22:45.894
WON THE AWARDS JUST AREN'T WHAT

01:22:45.960 --> 01:22:47.662
THEY THEY USED TO BE WHEN YOU

01:22:47.729 --> 01:22:49.164
LOOK AT THE TOTAL COST OF

01:22:49.230 --> 01:22:50.832
INSTRUCTION THAT.

01:22:50.899 --> 01:22:52.534
WE LOOK AT BOOKS AND HOUSING AND

01:22:52.600 --> 01:22:54.169
FOOD AND TRANSPORTATION.

01:22:54.235 --> 01:22:55.870
THE TUITION IS JUST A PIECE OF

01:22:55.937 --> 01:22:57.539
THE PUZZLE YESTERDAY I WAS AT

01:22:57.605 --> 01:23:01.276
THAT AT THE CSU AND WORK TWO

01:23:01.343 --> 01:23:02.277
THIRDS OF THE STUDENTS THERE.

01:23:02.344 --> 01:23:05.180
GET SOME TYPE OF FINANCIAL AID

01:23:05.246 --> 01:23:06.348
TO PAY FOR TUITION BUT THEY'RE

01:23:06.414 --> 01:23:07.749
STILL STRAPPED THEY HAD THE FOOD

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:08.850
PANTRIES WHICH IS UNBELIEVABLE

01:23:08.917 --> 01:23:10.919
WE HAVE FOOD PANTRIES ON COLLEGE

01:23:10.985 --> 01:23:13.254
CAMPUSES NOW YEAH. ONE IN TEN

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:14.389
STUDENTS AT CS YOUR HOMELESS

01:23:14.456 --> 01:23:15.790
WERE DEBATING A BILL TO ALLOW

01:23:15.857 --> 01:23:17.392
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS TO

01:23:17.459 --> 01:23:20.061
SLEEP IN PARKING LOTS.

01:23:20.128 --> 01:23:20.261
MANY.

01:23:20.328 --> 01:23:21.229
THAT THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO GO

01:23:21.296 --> 01:23:23.865
BACK TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS AND SO.

01:23:23.932 --> 01:23:25.100
I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE

01:23:25.166 --> 01:23:28.436
FINANCIAL AID MODEL TO COVER

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.738
THESE NON TUITION COSTS SO.

01:23:29.804 --> 01:23:32.073
STREAMY PROPOLIS ON THAT ON THE

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:33.241
ADD ON A WORDS TO TO GO TO THE

01:23:33.308 --> 01:23:34.876
BENCH WE GET TO A PATH WHERE YOU

01:23:34.943 --> 01:23:36.144
CAN GRADUATE DEBT FREE.

01:23:36.211 --> 01:23:37.746
NOT FREE CALLS BUT DEBT FREE.

01:23:37.812 --> 01:23:40.715
BUT THE BUT THE OTHER THIS ISSUE

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:41.916
TOO IS THAT THERE'S TOO MANY

01:23:41.983 --> 01:23:42.350
STUDENTS WHO JUST.

01:23:42.417 --> 01:23:44.052
MISSED OUT AND WE'VE BEEN

01:23:44.119 --> 01:23:45.920
TWEAKING THIS GREAT CAL GRANT

01:23:45.987 --> 01:23:47.989
PROGRAM FOR DECADES BUT EVERY

01:23:48.056 --> 01:23:48.523
TWEAK IS.

01:23:48.590 --> 01:23:51.025
CARVING PEOPLE OUT AND AS AS

01:23:51.092 --> 01:23:53.695
THAT MR DONNA SAID EARLIER YOU

01:23:53.762 --> 01:23:54.262
HAVE TO HAVE THAT.

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:55.697
AT PHD IN FINANCIAL AID TO

01:23:55.764 --> 01:23:57.232
UNDERSTAND THIS WHEN WHEN WE

01:23:57.298 --> 01:23:59.267
LITERALLY.

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:01.536
DRAFTED THE BILL. TO REFORM THE

01:24:01.603 --> 01:24:03.271
CAL GRANT PROPOSAL IT TOOK

01:24:03.338 --> 01:24:05.373
PLEDGE COUNCIL MULTIPLE LAYERS

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:07.976
IN A MONTH. TO FIGURE IT OUT

01:24:08.042 --> 01:24:08.610
FINALLY SAID YOU KNOW WHAT THIS

01:24:08.676 --> 01:24:09.778
IS SCRAP IT AND START FROM

01:24:09.844 --> 01:24:12.046
SCRATCH BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY.

01:24:12.113 --> 01:24:14.182
CARVE OUTS AND ADD ONS IN THIS

01:24:14.249 --> 01:24:15.950
PERSON BUT NOT THAT PERSON THAT.

01:24:16.017 --> 01:24:18.286
AND SO IT JUST IT -- I KNOW

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.522
WE'VE TRIED OVER THE YEARS TO

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:22.257
EXPAND FINANCIALLY BUT WE MADE

01:24:22.323 --> 01:24:22.891
ONE MORE COMPLICATED INTO WERE

01:24:22.957 --> 01:24:23.792
STILL.

01:24:23.858 --> 01:24:25.026
A SQUEEZING OUT TOO MANY PEOPLE

01:24:25.093 --> 01:24:28.396
WHO ARE WHO ARE ELIGIBLE AND

01:24:28.463 --> 01:24:30.665
NEEDY SO -- THIS IS CERTAINLY

01:24:30.732 --> 01:24:31.900
SOMETHING THAT.

01:24:31.966 --> 01:24:33.735
WE'RE GONNA ATTEMPTED TO STEP UP

01:24:33.802 --> 01:24:36.037

ATTEMPT TO IMPLEMENT OVER A

01:24:38.406 --> 01:24:39.808
NUMBER YEARS WE THINK YOU KNOW

01:31:00.788 --> 01:31:01.556
GOOD.

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:05.459
DO DO WE ENVISION IN THIS -- AND

01:31:05.526 --> 01:31:07.261
AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PROPOSE

01:31:07.328 --> 01:31:09.063
A SYSTEM THAT THAT GETS AWAY

01:31:09.130 --> 01:31:11.632
WITH SOME OF ALL THE DIFFERENT

01:31:11.699 --> 01:31:14.735
CATEGORIES AND TRIES -- TO MAKE

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:17.205
IT MORE USER FRIENDLY AND AND

01:31:17.271 --> 01:31:18.773
PERHAPS SIMPLER.

01:31:18.840 --> 01:31:20.842
ABSOLUTELY I THINK -- FROM THE

01:31:20.908 --> 01:31:23.110
COMMISSION AND WORKING WITH --

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:24.679
THAT EXCELLENT STAFF YOUR POLICY

01:31:24.745 --> 01:31:26.347
COMMITTEE ON OFFICE STAFF IN THE

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:28.149
BUDGET COMMITTEE STAFF -- WE

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:29.784
HAVE CONSISTENTLY BEEN SPEAKING

01:31:29.851 --> 01:31:31.552
ABOUT IN SUPPORTING THE IDEA OF

01:31:31.619 --> 01:31:33.955
A STREAMLINED SORT OF ONE CAL

01:31:34.021 --> 01:31:35.957
GRANT SYSTEM -- FOR LACK OF A

01:31:36.023 --> 01:31:37.692
BETTER TERMINOLOGY THERE WILL

01:31:37.758 --> 01:31:39.660
STILL BE COMPLEXITIES FINANCIAL

01:31:39.727 --> 01:31:40.094
AID.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:42.430
IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET AWAY FROM

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:43.898
SOME OF THE COMPLEXITIES BECAUSE

01:31:43.965 --> 01:31:46.200
THERE'S MULTIPLE LAYERS FEDERAL

01:31:46.267 --> 01:31:47.935
LATER STATED THERE'S A PROVIDED

01:31:48.002 --> 01:31:49.570
BY THE INSTITUTION.

01:31:49.637 --> 01:31:50.872
SO BUT AS A COLLEAGUE OF MINE

01:31:50.938 --> 01:31:51.906
LIKES TO SAY.

01:31:51.973 --> 01:31:53.207
IN OUR IDEAL WORLD WE WOULD PUT

01:31:53.274 --> 01:31:54.542
AS MUCH OF THAT COMPLEXITY

01:31:54.609 --> 01:31:55.910
BEHIND THE CURTAIN AS POSSIBLE

01:31:55.977 --> 01:31:57.345
SO THE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES

01:31:57.411 --> 01:31:58.813
DON'T NEED.

01:31:58.880 --> 01:32:00.014
TO SEE THIS DETAILED BREAKDOWN

01:32:00.081 --> 01:32:02.049
OF THE DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF

01:32:02.116 --> 01:32:02.950
CAL GRANT APPELLATE RAN IN

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:04.185
INCOME AN EXPECTED FAMILY

01:32:04.252 --> 01:32:06.520
CONTRIBUTION THAT THE THAT FROM

01:32:06.587 --> 01:32:08.623
THE STUDENT PERSPECTIVE -- THEY

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:09.790
JUST NEED TO PROVIDE A SMALL

01:32:09.857 --> 01:32:11.759
AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND THEY

01:32:11.826 --> 01:32:13.361
WOULD IDEALLY IMMEDIATELY KNOW

01:32:13.427 --> 01:32:15.363
WHAT THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR AND

01:32:15.429 --> 01:32:16.597
HOW TO GET IT SO YOU YOU

01:32:16.664 --> 01:32:18.366
WOULDN'T BE APPLYING.

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:22.870
FOR YOU KNOW A. BE COMPETITIVE

01:32:22.937 --> 01:32:24.205
WE'RE TRYING TO WORK WITH WE

01:32:24.272 --> 01:32:26.307
WOULD IDEALLY LIKE TO STUDENT TO

01:32:26.374 --> 01:32:26.874
NOT EVEN HAVE TO KNOW THOSE

01:32:26.941 --> 01:32:28.042
TERMS -- IF AT ALL POSSIBLE TO

01:32:28.109 --> 01:32:28.943
JUST KNOW THAT THERE'S A CAL

01:32:29.010 --> 01:32:30.011
GRANT PROGRAM OUT THERE THAT THE

01:32:30.077 --> 01:32:31.946
STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- BELIEVES

01:32:32.013 --> 01:32:33.381
IN THEM AND WANTS TO INVEST IN

01:32:33.447 --> 01:32:37.952
THEIR SUCCESS -- IN HIGHER

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:39.353
EDUCATION.

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.187
SO HOPEFULLY AT THE END OF THE

01:32:40.254 --> 01:32:41.455
DAY IT WILL BE MORE USER

01:32:41.522 --> 01:32:42.657

SETTING UP -- MEAL LUNCH

CHOOSING CONCENTRA SALLY -- FOR

01:35:02.430 --> 01:35:04.432
SOME CONTEXT ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL --

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:07.201
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT RUNS A

01:35:07.268 --> 01:35:08.869
SUMMER MEAL PROGRAM -- TO

01:35:08.936 --> 01:35:10.337
PROVIDE FREE MEALS TO STUDENTS

01:35:10.404 --> 01:35:12.306
DURING THE SUMMER WHEN THEY'RE

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:14.975
NOT IN REAL ATTENDING SCHOOL.

01:35:15.042 --> 01:35:16.310
THIS ONE TO THE LIBRARY PROGRAM.

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:17.812
THE AIM OF IT IS TO INCREASE

01:35:17.878 --> 01:35:19.447
LIBRARY PARTICIPATION INTO THAT

01:35:19.513 --> 01:35:21.182
FEDERAL PROGRAM.

01:35:21.248 --> 01:35:23.184
THE FEDERAL FUNDS SUPPORT THE

01:35:23.250 --> 01:35:24.652
MEALS DIRECTLY AND SO WHAT THE

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:26.120
STATE FUNDS WOULD DO IN THIS

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:27.121
CASE WOULD.

01:35:27.188 --> 01:35:29.390
PROVIDE A SUPPORT THAT ASSIST

01:35:29.457 --> 01:35:31.659
LIBRARIES AND PARTICIPATING IN

01:35:31.725 --> 01:35:33.360
THAT FEDERAL PROGRAM SO PORTION

01:35:33.427 --> 01:35:34.462
OF FUNDING WOULD BE FOR OUT

01:35:34.528 --> 01:35:36.831
REACH TO GET MORE LIBRARIES TO

01:35:36.897 --> 01:35:38.132
PARTICIPATE IN THE PROGRAM.

01:35:38.199 --> 01:35:39.400
ANOTHER PORTION OF FUNDING WOULD

01:35:39.467 --> 01:35:40.835
PROVIDE GRANTS THAT EITHER HELP

01:35:40.901 --> 01:35:43.471
LIBRARIES WITH THE START UP

01:35:43.537 --> 01:35:44.271
COSTS TO DEVELOP THE SIGHTS.

01:35:44.338 --> 01:35:46.207
IT WOULD ALSO PROVIDE FUNDING

01:35:46.273 --> 01:35:47.208
FOR WHICH YOU COULD THINK OF A

01:35:47.274 --> 01:35:49.877
WRAPAROUND SERVICES ARE READING

01:35:49.944 --> 01:35:51.612
PROGRAMS AND OTHER IN SUMMER AND

01:35:51.679 --> 01:35:52.847
MUCH MORE PROGRAMS THAT STUDENTS --

01:35:52.913 --> 01:35:54.215
WHAT COULD PARTICIPATE IN AS

01:35:54.281 --> 01:35:59.186
THEIR -- ACCESSING A FREE MEAL.

01:35:59.253 --> 01:36:00.788
AND PROPOSED AND DEVELOPING THIS

01:36:00.855 --> 01:36:01.388
PROPOSAL WE THINK THE GOVERNOR

01:36:01.455 --> 01:36:02.957
HAS REYES A SAILING ISSUE FOR

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:03.524
THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER

01:36:03.591 --> 01:36:03.791
WHICH IS.

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:05.559
OF FOOD INSECURITY AMONG

01:36:05.626 --> 01:36:07.094
CHILDREN DURING THE SUMMER --

01:36:07.161 --> 01:36:09.029
SOME ESTIMATES SUGGEST THAT --

01:36:09.096 --> 01:36:11.699
ABOUT 19% OF CALIFORNIA CHILDREN

01:36:11.765 --> 01:36:13.367
OR FOOD AND SECURE.

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:14.668
THERE ISN'T DATA ON THE

01:36:14.735 --> 01:36:16.804
SEASONALITY OF THAT BUT IT'S

01:36:16.871 --> 01:36:18.639
POSSIBLE THAT THAT INSECURITY

01:36:18.706 --> 01:36:20.541
INCREASES DURING THE SUMMER WHEN

01:36:20.608 --> 01:36:21.876
STUDENTS AREN'T ENROLLED IN

01:36:21.942 --> 01:36:22.443
SCHOOL.

01:36:22.510 --> 01:36:24.912
AND THAT RATE -- FLUCTUATES

01:36:24.979 --> 01:36:28.315
SOMEWHAT -- IT'S THE TIRE INLAND --

01:36:28.382 --> 01:36:29.116
TO TEND TO BE HIGHER IN IN ONE

01:36:29.183 --> 01:36:30.251
COUNTIES MORE ALONG THE COAST

01:36:30.317 --> 01:36:33.420
BUT THERE IS SOME VARIABILITY

01:36:33.487 --> 01:36:35.656
THERE ACROSS THE STATE.

01:36:35.723 --> 01:36:36.924
WE ALSO THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

01:36:36.991 --> 01:36:37.758
APPROACH OF OF TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:36:37.825 --> 01:36:39.059
THIS ISSUE BY -- DRAWING DOWN

01:36:39.126 --> 01:36:41.195
MORE FEDERAL FUNDS IS REASONABLE --

01:36:41.262 --> 01:36:43.831
OUR CONCERN HERE IS THAT -- BY

01:36:43.898 --> 01:36:45.966
FOCUSING JUST ON LIBRARY

01:36:46.033 --> 01:36:47.234
PARTICIPATION.

01:36:47.301 --> 01:36:48.002
WE'RE CONCERNED THAT THE

01:36:48.068 --> 01:36:49.136
GOVERNOR'S TAKING A SOMEWHAT

01:36:49.203 --> 01:36:50.671
NARROW APPROACH.

01:36:50.738 --> 01:36:52.640
OF THE FEDERAL MEAL PROGRAM

01:36:52.706 --> 01:36:54.275
LIBRARIES ARE ARE ONE IT SORT OF

01:36:54.341 --> 01:36:54.942
ENTITIES THAT CAN PARTICIPATE IN

01:36:55.009 --> 01:36:56.510
IT SCHOOLS CAN ALSO SERVICE

01:36:56.577 --> 01:36:58.646
SITES OTHER NON PROFITS AND

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:02.950
LOCAL INDIES CAM CONSERVA SITES.

01:37:03.017 --> 01:37:04.051
AND PRESUMABLY -- COMMUNITIES

01:37:04.118 --> 01:37:05.319
VERY IN TERMS OF WHICH OF THESE

01:37:05.386 --> 01:37:06.320
SITES ARE THE BEST FOR SITES TO

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:11.392
DELIVER MEALS TO TWO CHILDREN.

01:37:11.458 --> 01:37:12.726
GIVEN THIS CONCERN WE RECOMMEND

01:37:12.793 --> 01:37:13.994
THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT THE STATE

01:37:14.061 --> 01:37:16.664
LIBRARY TO COORDINATE -- WITH

01:37:16.730 --> 01:37:18.432
THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO

01:37:18.499 --> 01:37:20.434
DEVELOP A A MORE COMPREHENSIVE

01:37:20.501 --> 01:37:22.136
PLAN I'M NOT COMPREHENSIVE PLAN

01:37:22.203 --> 01:37:24.672
WOULDN'T INCLUDE THINGS LIKE --

01:37:24.738 --> 01:37:26.607
INVITING MORE SITES TO

01:37:26.674 --> 01:37:29.276
PARTICIPATE NOT JUST LIBRARIES --

01:37:29.343 --> 01:37:30.978
WOULD CONSIDER COMPREHENSIVE SET

01:37:31.045 --> 01:37:33.414
OF PLANS -- TO ENCOURAGE MORE

01:37:33.480 --> 01:37:34.615
CHILDREN TO PARTICIPATE IN THE

01:37:34.682 --> 01:37:36.517
MAIL PROGRAM THAT COULD INCLUDE

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.152
MORE SITES BUT ALSO POTENTIALLY

01:37:38.219 --> 01:37:38.886
OTHER.

01:37:38.953 --> 01:37:42.356
OPTIONS LIKE IMPROVING OUT REACH

01:37:42.423 --> 01:37:44.725
AND AN IMPROVING -- UP POP --

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.560
THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PROGRAM

01:37:46.627 --> 01:37:47.895
AMONG THE POPULATION CAN ALSO

01:37:47.962 --> 01:37:49.563
TARGET FUNDING TOWARDS REGIONS

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:52.633
WHERE THE INCIDENCE OF FOOD AND

01:37:52.700 --> 01:37:54.235
SECURITY IS HIGHER.

01:37:54.301 --> 01:37:55.469
NO DEVELOPING THIS PLAN YOU ONLY

01:37:55.536 --> 01:37:56.070
HAVE A FEW WEEKS BEFORE MAYOR

01:37:56.136 --> 01:37:58.305
VISION SO IT'S PROBABLY TOO LATE.

01:37:58.372 --> 01:37:59.974
TO HAVE SOMETHING IN TIME FOR

01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:01.008

01:38:46.754 --> 01:38:49.189
A CATEGORY OF PLACES WHERE

01:39:02.403 --> 01:39:05.272
THE THERE'S A AND THERE'S AN

01:39:05.339 --> 01:39:07.141
INCREASING NUMBER OF PEOPLE

01:39:07.207 --> 01:39:09.009
GOING TO LIBRARIES BECAUSE THEY

01:39:09.076 --> 01:39:10.544
WANT TO GO TO LIBRARIES IT'S A

01:39:10.611 --> 01:39:12.379
SAFE AND STIGMA OF FREE

01:39:12.446 --> 01:39:13.747
ENVIRONMENT.

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:15.749
THE KIDS CAN NOT ONLY GET A FREE

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:18.986
MEAL -- BUT ALSO BENEFIT FROM

01:39:19.053 --> 01:39:20.321

AND IN FOWLER FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:39:30.297 --> 01:39:33.267
GROWERS CONTRIBUTED PALLETS OF

01:39:33.334 --> 01:39:35.669

PLANTING BEANS AND DIXIE CUPS

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:43.477
DOWN WITH.

01:39:43.544 --> 01:39:44.812
IT WHAT I THINK OF HIS COMMUNITY

01:39:44.878 --> 01:39:47.181
NAVIGATORS TO HELP THEM CONNECT

01:39:47.247 --> 01:39:49.149

GETTING THE THE FREE MAIL WHICH

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:01.228
LIKE IF CALIFORNIA GETS THE

01:40:01.295 --> 01:40:02.830
PEOPLE THERE THE FEDERAL

01:40:02.896 --> 01:40:04.565
GOVERNMENT PAYS FOR THE PAYS FOR

01:40:04.631 --> 01:40:05.766

01:40:05.833 --> 01:40:07.935
EVERY SINGLE PERSON SAID WHERE

DO WE SIGN UP FOR SUMMER READING.

01:40:10.371 --> 01:40:11.905
AND I MEAN WITH RESPECT TO MEAN

01:40:11.972 --> 01:40:14.208
THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT'S

01:40:14.274 --> 01:40:15.376
GONNA HAPPEN THAT.

01:40:15.442 --> 01:40:18.746
COMMUNITY CENTERS OR PLACES THAT

01:40:18.812 --> 01:40:21.281
OUR NEXT -- HOMELESS SHELTERS

01:40:21.348 --> 01:40:23.217
ARE SOME OF THE OTHER -- IT

01:40:23.283 --> 01:40:25.419
INSTITUTIONS ARE FACILITIES THAT

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:26.553
SERVE SUMMER LUNCHES.

01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:30.724
SO WOULD IT BE A GOOD THING TO

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:32.526
HAVE SOME KIND OF GLOBAL

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:33.160
STRATEGY.

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:35.329

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:47.508
SO.

01:40:47.574 --> 01:40:48.175
I DON'T MEAN THIS MAINLY BUT IF

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:49.143
THERE'S ANYONE SITTING HERE AT

01:40:49.209 --> 01:40:50.010
THE TABLE WHOSE TIGHT WITH THE

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:50.577
BUCKETS THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:40:50.644 --> 01:40:52.045
FINANCE SO THEY WOULDN'T PUT

01:40:52.112 --> 01:40:53.547
THIS AND IF IT WAS.

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:55.282
LIKE A PIG IN A POKE OR SOME

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:58.519
KIND OF A BOONDOGGLE THING.

01:40:58.585 --> 01:41:01.255

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:04.691
OKAY I GUESS I'M NOT GONNA GET

01:41:04.758 --> 01:41:07.528
THE PR JOB AT YOUR PLAN.

01:41:07.594 --> 01:41:09.696
TAKING A PUP.

01:41:09.763 --> 01:41:11.832
ALREADY WELL I I I I GUESS THAT

01:41:11.899 --> 01:41:12.699
THAT NOTION HERE IS A SIMPLE ONE

01:41:12.766 --> 01:41:13.333
IS.

01:41:13.400 --> 01:41:15.969
TO MAXIMIZE OUR EXISTING --

01:41:16.036 --> 01:41:17.037
MEALS PROGRAMS AND DRAWN AS MUCH

01:41:17.104 --> 01:41:17.938
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:19.807
MONEY AS WE CAN.

01:41:19.873 --> 01:41:20.407
TO BE KIDS IN THE SUMMER AND I

01:41:20.474 --> 01:41:21.408

01:41:21.475 --> 01:41:23.644
HERE IN SACRAMENTO I'M FAMILIAR

01:41:23.710 --> 01:41:25.479
WITH LOCATIONS THAT HAVE THESE --

01:41:25.546 --> 01:41:27.514
SUMMER MEALS PROGRAMS ARE LOCAL

01:41:27.581 --> 01:41:30.050
LIBRARIES AND I HAVE SEEN THEM

01:41:30.117 --> 01:41:32.052
FIRST HAND AND I THINK THEY'RE

01:41:32.119 --> 01:41:33.120
THEY'RE VERY SUCCESSFUL TELLS TO

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:34.521
THE EXTENT THAT WE CAN.

01:41:34.588 --> 01:41:37.958
DO THIS WITH A MILLION DOLLARS --

01:41:38.025 --> 01:41:40.761
AT THE BECAUSE A REASONABLE --

01:41:40.828 --> 01:41:41.628
PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:45.265
BUDGET QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS.

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:46.667
SEEING NONE WILL HOLD THIS ISSUE

01:41:46.733 --> 01:41:50.270
OPEN THANK YOU FOR THE MARY VICE.

01:41:50.337 --> 01:41:55.008
ISSUE NUMBER SEVEN ZIP BOOKS.

01:41:55.075 --> 01:41:56.477
FOR THE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:41:56.543 --> 01:41:58.512
PROPOSES ONE MILLION DOLLARS IN

01:41:58.579 --> 01:42:00.948
ONE TIME GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT

01:42:01.014 --> 01:42:02.683
THE TO BOOKS A PILOT PROJECT

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:04.852
THROUGH THE STATE LIBRARY --

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:06.220
THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS LIBRARY

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:08.255
PATRONS IN MORE RURAL AREAS OF

01:42:08.322 --> 01:42:09.189
THE STATE TO PURCHASE NEW

01:42:09.256 --> 01:42:10.858
MATERIALS WILL BECOME PART.

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:12.926
OF THE LIBRARY'S COLLECTION --

01:42:12.993 --> 01:42:16.063
THERE AFTER A SIMILAR INVESTMENT

01:42:16.129 --> 01:42:21.168
WAS MADE IN THE BUDGET ACT OF

01:42:21.235 --> 01:42:21.835
TWENTY AND JUST FOR SOME CONTEXT

01:42:21.902 --> 01:42:23.337
FOR THIS PROGRAM ALL THE WAY IT

01:42:23.403 --> 01:42:26.306
WORKS IS PARTICIPATING LIBRARIES.

01:42:26.373 --> 01:42:27.841
OTHER PATRONS DEMAND A BOOK THE

01:42:27.908 --> 01:42:29.710
LIBRARIES -- PURCHASE THE BOOK

01:42:29.776 --> 01:42:31.411
USUALLY BY ESTABLISHING A LINE

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:32.579
OF CREDIT.

01:42:32.646 --> 01:42:34.882
THE STATE THEN UP PURCHASES THE

01:42:34.948 --> 01:42:35.983
BOOK -- THAT'S THEN DELIVERED TO

01:42:36.049 --> 01:42:37.518
THE PATRON WHO THEN RETURNS THE

01:42:37.584 --> 01:42:39.119
BOOK TO THE LIBRARY -- IN THE

01:42:39.186 --> 01:42:40.654
LIBRARY AT THAT POINT CAN DECIDE

01:42:40.721 --> 01:42:43.924
TO MAINTAIN THE BOOK OR I SELL

01:42:43.991 --> 01:42:45.959
THE BOOK THROUGH IT SOME

01:42:46.026 --> 01:42:48.662
FOUNDATION.

01:42:48.729 --> 01:42:49.997
OUR OUR ASSESSMENT HERE IS GOING

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:52.099
TO SOUND SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO THE

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:54.067
PREVIOUS PROPOSAL AND A

01:42:54.134 --> 01:42:55.269
RECOMMENDATION AS WELL.

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:56.904
BUT WE THINK THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:42:56.970 --> 01:42:58.338
IS ALSO IDENTIFIED ANOTHER A KEY

01:42:58.405 --> 01:42:59.640
ISSUE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO

01:42:59.706 --> 01:43:01.842
CONSIDER WHICH IS -- PATRON

01:43:01.909 --> 01:43:04.444
ACCESS TO LIBRARY RESOURCES --

01:43:04.511 --> 01:43:06.246
IN LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS THAT

01:43:06.313 --> 01:43:07.748
ARE RURAL AND HAVE BEEN A

01:43:07.814 --> 01:43:10.050
RELATIVELY UNDER RESOURCE.

01:43:10.117 --> 01:43:11.685
AND OF INSURING LIBRARY PATRONS

01:43:11.752 --> 01:43:13.387
HAVE ACCESS TO THOSE RESOURCES

01:43:13.453 --> 01:43:14.187
HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING STATE

01:43:14.254 --> 01:43:16.957
GOAL AND IS CURRENTLY EXPRESSED

01:43:17.024 --> 01:43:19.026
IN STATE LAW.

01:43:19.092 --> 01:43:20.027
OUR CONCERNS ARE THIS PROPOSAL

01:43:20.093 --> 01:43:20.861
IS THAT THERE WERE SOME KEY

01:43:20.928 --> 01:43:21.595
CONSIDERATIONS THAT -- THE

01:43:21.662 --> 01:43:23.630
PROPOSAL THAT WAS PROVIDED TO US --

01:43:23.697 --> 01:43:25.232
LACKED.

01:43:25.299 --> 01:43:27.901
THE FIRST CONSIDERATION WAS A

01:43:27.968 --> 01:43:31.471
DATA ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH THIS

01:43:31.538 --> 01:43:32.372
IS HAPPENING -- THAT LIBRARIES

01:43:32.439 --> 01:43:34.074
ARE ABLE TO BE PATRON DEMANDS

01:43:34.141 --> 01:43:35.909
WHICH LIBRARIES AND THE EXTENT

01:43:35.976 --> 01:43:37.444
TO WHICH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE OF

01:43:37.511 --> 01:43:39.212
THIS PROBLEM SO THAT WE CAN

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:40.547
BETTER UNDERSTAND IF THE PROGRAM

01:43:40.614 --> 01:43:43.016
IS ADEQUATELY TARGETED OR THAT

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:45.352
IS TARGETING THE THE RIVER.

01:43:45.419 --> 01:43:47.821
RIGHT LIBRARY JURISDICTIONS.

01:43:47.888 --> 01:43:48.722
ON THE PROPOSAL ALSO OF DIDN'T

01:43:48.789 --> 01:43:50.424
CONSIDER SOME -- ADDITIONAL

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:51.892
ALTERNATIVES THAT COULD BE USED

01:43:51.959 --> 01:43:54.194
TO EXPAND ACCESS -- TO PATRONS

01:43:54.261 --> 01:43:55.896
ARE RURAL AREAS OF THE STATE

01:43:55.963 --> 01:43:57.564
SUCH AS EXPANDING THE USE OF

01:43:57.631 --> 01:44:00.133
ELECTRONIC RESOURCES FOR EXAMPLE.

01:44:00.200 --> 01:44:00.867
AND THEN IN ADDITION THE

01:44:00.934 --> 01:44:02.469
PROPOSAL DIDN'T CONSIDER THE

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:04.771
LOCAL RESOURCES THAT LIBRARIES --

01:44:04.838 --> 01:44:06.907
SOMETIMES HAVE TO TO PURCHASE

01:44:06.974 --> 01:44:07.975
PRINT MATERIALS.

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.276
FROM THE DATA WE LOOKED AT

01:44:09.343 --> 01:44:10.844
SUGGESTED THAT OF THE SIXTY NINE

01:44:10.911 --> 01:44:12.779
WIPERS ARE CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE

01:44:12.846 --> 01:44:15.082
IN THE BOOKS -- THEY SPEND ABOUT

01:44:15.148 --> 01:44:16.283
TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY

01:44:16.350 --> 01:44:18.051
OUGHT TO ACQUIRE PRINT MATERIALS

01:44:18.118 --> 01:44:20.253
OBVIOUSLY THAT THAT ESTIMATE

01:44:20.320 --> 01:44:21.955
VARIES BY LIBRARY JURISDICTION

01:44:22.022 --> 01:44:23.256
SO SOME LIBRARIES HAVE MORE

01:44:23.323 --> 01:44:24.558
RESOURCES THAN OTHERS WITHIN

01:44:24.625 --> 01:44:26.960
THAT GROUP. TO TO PURCHASE THOSE

01:44:27.027 --> 01:44:28.895
MATERIALS.

01:44:28.962 --> 01:44:29.463
IN ADDITION WE HAD REQUESTED

01:44:29.529 --> 01:44:30.297
SOME HISTORICAL DATA ON THE

01:44:30.364 --> 01:44:31.665
PROGRAM THE PROGRAM'S BEEN

01:44:31.732 --> 01:44:33.800
AROUND FOR A FEW YEARS AT LEAST

01:44:33.867 --> 01:44:34.434

BY INVITING THE ADMINISTRATION

LIBRARIES DECIDED TO DO THAT

01:46:50.437 --> 01:46:52.372
BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING EXPENSE

01:46:52.439 --> 01:46:54.541

IT IS LIKELY GOING TO BE

01:49:45.612 --> 01:49:47.080
CONSIDERABLE WORKLOAD THIS STATE

ALSO BE SOME ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD --

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:17.110
THE STATE LIBRARY INDICATES THAT

01:50:17.177 --> 01:50:18.645

PERMANENT POSITIONS. TO THAT END

01:50:39.165 --> 01:50:42.035
WE WE WOULD NORMALLY RECOMMEND --

OF THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDING

01:50:43.169 --> 01:50:44.471
LIMITED TERM FUNDING AND AND

01:50:44.537 --> 01:50:46.239
REVISITING WORKLOAD DEMANDS IN A

01:50:46.306 --> 01:50:48.375
FEW YEARS TO COME CONTINUE TO

01:50:48.441 --> 01:50:49.242

01:50:49.309 --> 01:50:50.043
JUSTIFIED.

01:50:50.110 --> 01:50:50.710
NOW WHEN WE BROUGHT THIS UP WITH

01:50:50.777 --> 01:50:52.078
THE ADMINISTRATION ONE CONCERN

01:50:52.145 --> 01:50:54.981

THE LEGISLATURE AND WERE TO WANT --

01:51:06.259 --> 01:51:07.093

01:53:49.722 --> 01:53:52.125
AS THESE FACTORS WILL --

01:53:52.192 --> 01:53:54.327
INFLUENCE A SCHOOL'S ABILITY --

01:53:54.394 --> 01:53:56.796
TO ELIMINATE ITS BUDGET DEFICIT

01:53:56.863 --> 01:53:58.698
OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.

01:53:58.765 --> 01:54:00.300
AS A AS AN UPDATE THE LAW SCHOOL

01:54:00.366 --> 01:54:01.968
HAS REGULARLY.

01:54:02.035 --> 01:54:03.303
UP SUBMITTED TO US FIVE YEAR

01:54:03.369 --> 01:54:06.005
PLANS TO ELIMINATE THIS DEFICIT

01:54:06.072 --> 01:54:07.473
I'M IN THIS MOST RECENT PLANNED

01:54:07.540 --> 01:54:08.841
THE LAW SCHOOL.

01:54:08.908 --> 01:54:09.943
DISSIPATES ELIMINATING THIS

01:54:10.009 --> 01:54:13.446
DEFICIT BY -- TWENTY TWENTY TWO

01:54:13.513 --> 01:54:14.047
TWENTY THREE THAT'S ABOUT ONE

01:54:14.113 --> 01:54:15.782
YEAR LONGER THAN A WHAT THE LAW

01:54:15.848 --> 01:54:18.351
SCHOOL HAD ANTICIPATED FOR LAST

01:54:18.418 --> 01:54:18.551
YEAR.

01:54:18.618 --> 01:54:19.919
ON THAT PLAN.

01:54:19.986 --> 01:54:21.821
THE MOSTLY ELIMINATES THE

01:54:21.888 --> 01:54:23.323
DEFICIT BY -- AT LEAST THE

01:54:23.389 --> 01:54:24.891
VERSION THAT WE'VE SEEN AND IT'S

01:54:24.958 --> 01:54:27.093
A PLAN THAT THAT CHANGES.

01:54:27.160 --> 01:54:28.261
YOU KNOW FROM TIME TO TIME BUT

01:54:28.328 --> 01:54:29.896
THE THE PLAN THAT WE'VE SEEN.

01:54:29.963 --> 01:54:31.397
ASSUMED -- TUITION INCREASES

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:35.235
BEGINNING AND TWENTY TWENTY

01:54:35.301 --> 01:54:36.536
TWENTY ONE I'M IN THE IN FROM OF

01:54:36.603 --> 01:54:38.438
THE LIMITING THIS DEFICIT THE

01:54:38.504 --> 01:54:39.973
LAW SCHOOL ANTICIPATES.

01:54:40.039 --> 01:54:41.574
COVERING THIS DEFICIT THROUGH

01:54:41.641 --> 01:54:43.276
ITS RESERVES OF THE LAW SCHOOL

01:54:43.343 --> 01:54:45.178
ANTICIPATED WILL START -- HAVING

01:54:45.245 --> 01:54:47.447
SPENT DOWN ITS OPERATING GENERAL

01:54:47.513 --> 01:54:48.982
OPERATING RESERVE AND WILL STOP

01:54:49.048 --> 01:54:50.750
START -- COVERING BECAUSE

01:54:50.817 --> 01:54:51.584
THEY'RE MEAN IT REMAINED OR

01:54:51.651 --> 01:54:52.819
DEFICIT WITH IT SO RESERVE

01:54:52.885 --> 01:54:56.756
THAT'S A DESIGNATED -- FOR

01:54:56.823 --> 01:54:58.591
BUILDING MAINTENANCE.

01:54:58.658 --> 01:54:59.892
WE WOULD NOTE THAT WHEN THE

01:54:59.959 --> 01:55:01.227
SCHOOL STARTED DEFICIT SPENDING

01:55:01.294 --> 01:55:02.695
IT WAS A PERIOD OF TIME WHEN THE

01:55:02.762 --> 01:55:05.331
ECONOMY WAS STRONG AND THE

01:55:05.398 --> 01:55:06.966
SCHOOL RECEIVING BASE INCREASES --

01:55:07.033 --> 01:55:08.768
WERE THE STATE TO EXPERIENCE A

01:55:08.835 --> 01:55:11.638
RECESSION -- CORRECTING OF

01:55:11.704 --> 01:55:13.206
HASTINGS BUDGET DEFICIT COULD

01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:14.707
POSE RISKS THE LEGISLATURE AND

01:55:14.774 --> 01:55:15.875
COULD RESULT IN.

01:55:15.942 --> 01:55:17.110
POTENTIALLY MORE DIFFICULT

01:55:17.176 --> 01:55:18.678
DECISIONS SUCH AS HIGHER TUITION

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:19.879
INCREASES FOR STUDENTS FOR

01:55:19.946 --> 01:55:21.314
EXAMPLE SO THAT'S WHY WE

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:22.949
ENCOURAGE LEGISLATURE REVIEW

01:55:23.016 --> 01:55:23.416
THIS PLANET INSURANCE

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:25.418
COMFORTABLE WITH.

01:55:25.485 --> 01:55:25.952
OTHER SECTIONS THE SCHOOLS

01:55:26.019 --> 01:55:27.287
MAKING.

01:55:27.353 --> 01:55:29.322
WITH REGARD TO THE SECOND

01:55:29.389 --> 01:55:30.523

MANY TIMES THROUGHOUT YOUR

SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING SO WE

01:55:34.093 --> 01:55:35.595
GENERALLY FIND DEFERRED

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:36.429

01:55:36.496 --> 01:55:38.931
PRIORITY FOR ONE TIME FUNDING.

01:55:38.998 --> 01:55:40.800
IN THIS CASE WE RECOMMEND

01:55:40.867 --> 01:55:42.135
REJECTING THE PROPOSAL.

01:55:42.201 --> 01:55:44.304
ON A REASONS ARE TWO FOLD THE

01:55:44.370 --> 01:55:45.805
FIRST IS THAT.

01:55:45.872 --> 01:55:47.473
A SCHOOL -- OF ITS REMAINING

01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:49.075
MAINTENANCE BACKLOG A PORTION OF

01:55:49.142 --> 01:55:51.077
THOSE PROJECTS ARE SOMEWHAT

01:55:51.144 --> 01:55:54.047
LOWER PRIORITY -- FOR EXAMPLE --

01:55:54.113 --> 01:55:55.381
INTERIOR REPAINTING AND

01:55:55.448 --> 01:55:57.517

THE SOME OTHER PROJECTS ARE ARE

01:55:58.751 --> 01:56:01.087
MORE REGULAR CRITICAL BUILDING

01:56:09.062 --> 01:56:10.063
THE SECOND.

01:56:10.129 --> 01:56:11.731
REASON WHY RECOMMEND REJECTING

01:56:11.798 --> 01:56:13.333
IS THAT THE SCHOOL HAS --

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:15.268
RESERVES DESIGNATED FOR BUILDING

01:56:15.335 --> 01:56:16.302

THE HOLD STEADY -- IN IN THE

02:06:06.892 --> 02:06:08.160

SAID IN A CLASS WILL BE LIKELY

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:12.598
AROUND THREE TEN AT THREE TWENTY

02:06:12.665 --> 02:06:14.667
AND THAT WILL CONTINUE -- FOR

02:06:14.733 --> 02:06:16.168
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

02:06:16.235 --> 02:06:18.070
YEAH WE HAVE NO PLANS TO REDUCE

02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:20.005
THAT ALLOWS FOR THE CLASS

02:06:20.072 --> 02:06:20.306
[inaudible]

OKAY -- AND AND YOU TALK ABOUT

02:06:23.208 --> 02:06:24.376
HOW THIS IS THE GENERAL TREND

02:06:24.443 --> 02:06:25.644
WITH LAW SCHOOLS ACROSS THE

02:06:25.711 --> 02:06:27.112
COUNTRY BECAUSE OF THEIR THE

02:06:27.179 --> 02:06:30.416
LEGAL JOB MARKET EXACTLY A HIGH --

02:06:30.482 --> 02:06:32.685
I I GUESS MY MY CONCERN YOU KNOW

02:06:32.751 --> 02:06:34.353
FOR MY EXPERIENCE TO HAVE A

02:06:34.420 --> 02:06:36.455
HAVING GONE TO UCLA LAW SCHOOL

02:06:36.522 --> 02:06:42.294
IS THAT -- YEAH I I I DON'T.

02:06:42.361 --> 02:06:45.097
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE THE **** THE

02:06:45.164 --> 02:06:47.099
LEGAL JOB MARKET IS IS PRIMARILY

02:06:47.166 --> 02:06:49.568
DRIVEN BY THE THE CORPORATE LAW

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:52.304
FIRMS AND IT'S NOT DRIVEN BY THE

02:06:52.371 --> 02:06:55.407
LACK OF GOOD PUBLIC SERVICE

02:06:55.474 --> 02:06:57.276
LAWYERS THAT THAT WOULD PROVIDE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:06:58.677
LIKE SAY.

BORDER OR YOU KNOW THE MANY

02:07:09.588 --> 02:07:10.789
OTHER NEEDS THAT THAT THAT WE

02:07:10.856 --> 02:07:13.425
CAN THINK OF WHERE WHERE LAWYERS

02:07:13.492 --> 02:07:17.096
CAN BE -- YOU KNOW VERY VERY

02:07:17.162 --> 02:07:19.231
USEFUL AND AND SO.

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:22.768
WHAT IS HASTINGS DOING YOU KNOW?

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:26.005
WHAT WHEN WHEN I SEE ON?

02:07:26.071 --> 02:07:28.974
WAIT WHEN WHEN I SEE MOST OF OF

02:07:29.041 --> 02:07:31.143
OF LAW SCHOOL GRADUATES GOING TO

02:07:31.210 --> 02:07:32.711
WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

02:07:32.778 --> 02:07:35.214
RATHER THAN WHILE WORKING AND

02:07:35.280 --> 02:07:37.082
PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS AND I I

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:41.186
DON'T THINK THAT THE THE THE THE

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:43.655
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE A LIKE BE.

02:07:43.722 --> 02:07:44.823
ENROLLMENT DECISIONS ARE BEING

02:07:44.890 --> 02:07:47.092
DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE PRIVATE

02:07:47.159 --> 02:07:49.695
LEGAL JOB MARKET RATHER THAN THE

02:07:49.762 --> 02:07:51.430

A CHANCE TO RESPOND.

02:07:54.600 --> 02:07:55.034
AND I THINK THAT'S AN

02:07:55.100 --> 02:07:57.236
INTERESTING OBSERVATION I THINK

02:07:57.302 --> 02:08:00.572
IT SUBMITS BAD -- WE HAVE ABOUT

02:08:00.639 --> 02:08:02.141

THAT.

02:10:47.039 --> 02:10:48.407
IT SEEMS TO ME LIKE.

02:10:48.473 --> 02:10:50.175
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:10:50.242 --> 02:10:51.643
INCLUDING HASTINGS SHOULD BE

02:10:51.710 --> 02:10:53.879
FOCUSING MORE ON EDUCATING

02:10:53.946 --> 02:10:55.180
ATTORNEYS TO GO INTO PUBLIC

02:10:55.247 --> 02:10:56.315
SERVICE.

02:10:56.381 --> 02:10:57.983

PROVIDING -- YOU KNOW.

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.654
BUT WHAT IT WHAT I ASSUME IS IS

02:11:02.721 --> 02:11:06.458
STILL A A CHEAPER ALTERNATIVE TO

02:11:06.525 --> 02:11:07.192
TWO PRIVATE LAW SCHOOLS.

02:11:07.259 --> 02:11:08.694

WITH A SOLUTION AND PROPOSAL.

02:11:17.603 --> 02:11:18.537
IT WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT BUT

02:11:18.604 --> 02:11:20.939
I I THINK YOU RAISE AN IMPORTANT

02:11:21.006 --> 02:11:21.506
ISSUE AND ONE THING I FIND

02:11:21.573 --> 02:11:22.374
INTERESTING.

02:11:22.441 --> 02:11:23.542
MISTER ICE WHICH IS IF YOU LOOK

02:11:23.609 --> 02:11:25.377
AT SAN FRANCISCO'S AND THE CSU

02:11:25.444 --> 02:11:26.612
DEBATE.

02:11:26.678 --> 02:11:27.980
SAN FRANCISCO STATE IS SEPARATE

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:29.648
TOPIC HERE IS IS ONE THE

02:11:29.715 --> 02:11:31.183
UNIVERSITIES WERE ENROLLMENT IS

02:11:31.250 --> 02:11:32.317
DECLINING.

02:11:32.384 --> 02:11:33.919
COVERED AREA SAN FRANCISCO SO

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:35.220
WHAT IS THAT MEANS THAT IT'S SO

02:11:35.287 --> 02:11:36.188
EXPENSIVE.

02:11:36.255 --> 02:11:37.189
THAT PEOPLE YOU KNOW THEY GOT

02:11:37.256 --> 02:11:40.792
ACCEPTED THERE LIKE NAM A PASS

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:41.693
YOU KNOW.

02:11:41.760 --> 02:11:42.661
I CAN'T AFFORD TO LIVE THERE SO

02:11:42.728 --> 02:11:44.796
WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT FORTY FOUR

02:11:44.863 --> 02:11:45.697
THOUSAND A YEAR.

02:11:45.764 --> 02:11:47.099
TUITION FOR SOMEONE WILL STICK

02:11:47.165 --> 02:11:48.700
THAT PURSUE A CAREER IN PUBLIC

02:11:48.767 --> 02:11:50.302
SERVICE.

02:11:50.369 --> 02:11:50.902
YOU LOOK AT THE HOUSING COSTS

02:11:50.969 --> 02:11:52.704
THE AVERAGE. ONE BEDROOM

02:11:52.771 --> 02:11:54.239
APARTMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO'S

02:11:54.306 --> 02:11:56.441
FOUR THOUSAND A MONTH.

02:11:56.508 --> 02:11:58.810
