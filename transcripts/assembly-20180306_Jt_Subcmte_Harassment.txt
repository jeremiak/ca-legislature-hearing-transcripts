HARASSMENT PREVENTION AND RESPONSE. WE'VE HAD A SERIES OF VERY. INTERESTING AND ELIMINATING HEARINGS DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE AND TODAY IS GOING TO BE I THINK A. VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF OF THE PUZZLE OF PUTTING TOGETHER A. A BETTER POLICY FOR THE LEGISLATURE SOMETHING THAT I THINK WILL BE A MODEL FOR. OTHER LEGISLATURES AND OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND TODAY WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT. INVESTIGATIONS INTO PROCESS AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH ARE VERY MUCH AT THE HEART OF OF WHAT A GOOD POLICY HAS TO CONTAIN. ARM. WITHOUT I WILL SEE IF ANY OF THE OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS BEFORE WE BEGIN. VICE CHAIRMAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU AGAIN ON THIS IS OUR FOURTH HEARING I JOKINGLY TOLD YOU FELT LIKE THE SEVENTY NINE. JUST BECAUSE. I APPRECIATE BEING ON THIS COMMITTEE APPRECIATE HAVING A SPACE TO REALLY BEGIN TO DELVE DEEP AND HAVE CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT SOLUTIONS. ALL I KNOW THAT WE ALL. ARE ENGAGED IN CONVERSATIONS WE HEAR HIM ABOUT THE CRITICISMS ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. IN TERMS OF HOW WE GOT TO THIS PLACE. AND CRITIQUES ABOUT OUR PROCESS SEES THIS FAR AND THAT'S WHY I'M GLAD THAT THIS COMMITTEE WAS FORMED AND THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING COLLECTIVELY. TO MOVE FROM CRITICISMS TO SOLUTIONS ULTIMATELY TO IMPLEMENTATION FOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND. IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE ON THE FOURTEENTH TODAY'S CONVERSATION. YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS. OF THE SENATE ARE NOW. OKAY WITH THAT WE ARE EXTREMELY LUCKY AND VERY HONORED TO BE JOINED TODAY BY RETIRED SUPREME COURT JUSTICE ARE THE HONORABLE CARLOS MORENO. TO ADDRESS US ABOUT THE TOPICS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING I KNOW THAT HIS EXPERIENCE AND HIS EXTREMELY THOUGHTFUL AND WELL RESPECTED APPROACH. HE'S COME ON UP ARE GOING TO. SERVICE VERY WELL AND I I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME TO TO COME BE WITH US TODAY. WITH THAT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MADAM. VICE CHAIR. IT IS INDEED A PLEASURE. TO BE HERE. OF I WAS ASKED BY THE COMMITTEE STAFF. TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE YOU BUT ALSO TO. SPEAK IN GENERAL TERMS. ABOUT THE. CONDUCT THAT CAN CONSTITUTE THE SHUCKS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. OF A BROAD ARRAY OF SANCTIONS THAT WE WOULD BE AVAILABLE TWENTY EDUCATE OF. BODY. THE QUESTION OF A DUE PROCESS AND HOW IT MIGHT APPLY. IN A SYSTEM OF A DISCIPLINE. OF THE TYPES OF APPROVING BURDENS OF PROOF THAT WOULD BE. NEEDED TO SUPPORT ANY KIND OF IMPOSITION OF SANCTIONS. AND THEN. FINALLY SOMETHING ABOUT THE SPECIAL CASE. OF A ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND I WAS ALSO ASKED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. SPRINT SYSTEM WITH RESPECT TO. HOW? THE SUPREME COURT AND WHEN I SAT ON THE SUPREME COURT. HOW IT DEALT WITH NOT NECESSARILY IDENTICAL ISSUE BUT SIMILAR ISSUES OF DISCIPLINE WITH RESPECT TO ATTORNEYS? AND ALSO UNFORTUNATELY. THE COURT ALSO HAD JURISDICTION OVER DISCIPLINING OF OF A JUDGE'S WHICH HAVE AN ANALOGOUS. SITUATION. SO WITH THAT IN MIND LET ME LET ME JUST. INTRODUCE MYSELF TERMS MIGHT MY BACKGROUND IS NOT ALL OF YOU MAY KNOW ME BUT I SERVED. FOR FIFTEEN YEARS ON BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS. IN CALIFORNIA. AND TEN YEARS ON THE CALIFORNIA. SUPREME COURT. AND OF THOSE WITH VARIOUS CAPACITIES I DID HAVE OCCASION. THE TWO. CONSIDER. THE CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT THE. GENDER AND ETHNIC. DISCRIMINATION. A NUMBER OF A CRIMINAL STATUTE AS A TRIAL JUDGE THAT. INVOLVED CERTAINLY. CRIMINAL SANCTIONS BEING IMPOSED. AND ON THE SUPREME COURT. AT THE APPELLATE LEVEL. I HAD THE YOU KNOW SOME EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH THOSE ISSUES AS WELL AS WELL. BUT I HAVE TO SAY HERE AS A AS A. AS A CAUTION I AM I AM NOT A SPECIALIZED EXPERT. IN THE FIELD I'M MORE OF A GENERALIST. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OTHERS THIS AFTERNOON WE'RE GOING TO SPEAK. PROBLEM WITH MORE DIRECT EXPERIENCE SOME OF THESE ISSUES. YOU KNOW WITH RESPECT TO THE SEVERITY OF OF CONDUCT THAT IS ACTIONABLE. THE WAY I SEE THIS IT'S REALLY ON ON ON A LARGE SPECTRUM. BEGINNING WITH THE WORDS AND GESTURES. INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT THAT. MAY OR MAY NOT INVOLVE. ANY CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AND AND MAYBE EVEN THE MAY NOT EVEN RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING. ACTIONABLE IN A CIVIL CONTACTS. AND CERTAINLY OUR PENAL CODE. AND I CAN ONLY THINK OF A ONE OR TWO. A CRIMINAL STATUTES THAT DEAL WITH MAKING CRIMINAL. OBJECTIONABLE WORDS AND TALK INCITING TO RIOT SOMETHING LIKE THAT. OF THE CRIMINAL. CODE. BASICALLY FOCUS ON. HARASSING THE TYPE OF ASSAULT ACTUALLY. OF A TOUCHING OVER CLOSE UNDER CLOTHES. AND MORE SUBSTANTIAL SEXUAL. CONDUCT. AND WITH EACH A DEGREE. OF. HELLO HEIGHTENED OFFENSE OF COURSE THE PUNISHMENT. OF IS MORE STRINGENT. AND THE COURTS ALSO LOOK AT. THINGS LIKE THE AGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO PARTIES. WHETHER THERE IS A VIOLATION OF TRUST. THAT COULD BE AN AREA OF SUPERIOR SUBORDINATE RELATIONSHIP CURRENTLY EMPLOYMENT. CONTEXT. WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S A QUID PRO QUO. MADE. FOR CERTAIN. CONCEPT. CONDUCT IN ORDER TO OBTAIN. SORT OF A COURSE OF A CONSENT. AND ONE FACTOR. BUT I THINK IS THE ALSO. VERY SERIOUS THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF RETALIATION. IT'S LIKE MANY TIMES THE. IT'S NOT SO MUCH THE ACT IN QUESTION THAT GETS THE PERSON IN TROUBLE IT'S HOW THE COMPANY WITH INDIVIDUAL. RESPONSE TO THAT SO RETALIATION COMPLAINS. CLAIMS BUT IF YOU GO THROUGH. THE LITERATURE IN THE LAW ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR. WE'LL ALSO LOOK AT. THE FACTORS IN IT MITIGATION. THINGS LIKE A MISTAKEN CONSENT. OF THE. JUST THE WORDS NOT BEING THERE OF THE ACTUAL WHO EXPRESS WHICH PERSON WORDS OF CONSENT. AND IN TERMS OF AGGRAVATION THE COURTS WOULD LOOK TO THE. OF THE USE OF FORCE OF ANY TYPE OR A. TRANSPORTING SOMEONE IN THE KIDNAPPING KIND OF SITUATION SO THOSE ARE ALL. FACTORS THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD ENHANCE OR MITIGATE A SENTENCE AND I THINK. WHEN A JUDGE LOOKS AT. OF. THIS KIND OF CONDUCT ON A SPECTRUM WE TAKE ALL THESE THINGS INTO. CONSIDERATION. NO SANCTIONS. OF BOTH IN THE. JUDICIAL SYSTEM AND ON THE STATE BAR. SCHEMES. OF. THERE ARE ISSUES OF THE. WHAT THE APPROPRIATE SANCTION I WOULD BE AND HOW DO YOU ARRIVE AT THAT? OF. THE STAGE. BOTH BOTH OF THOSE SCHEMES REALLY ARE MORE. JUDICIAL LEISTON I THINK WHAT WE MAY BE TALKING ABOUT HERE. I'VE READ SOME LITERATURE ON HOW COLLEGE CAMPUSES HANDLE. OF. ISSUES LIKE SEXUAL HARASSMENT WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT BE A CRIMINAL. THE SCHEMES IN BOTH THE PUNISHMENT. AGAINST LAWYERS AND PROTECT AGAINST JUDGES ALL INVOLVE KIND OF. YOU KNOW INVESTIGATIONS. ANNA ADJUDICATIVE BODY. A COMMITTEE OR THE ENTIRE BODY. MAKING. A DETERMINATION OF WHAT AN APPROPRIATE SANCTION WOULD BE. OUT OF THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN WHICH I SERVED WAS REALLY THE SUPERVISING ENTITY. OVER ATTORNEY DISCIPLINE. AS WELL AS JUDICIAL DISCIPLINE. AT THE EXTREME THE PUNISHMENT WOULD BE DISBARMENT. AT THE OTHER EXTREME THAT MIGHT BE JUST A PRIVATE. A REPRIMAND. UP NEXT WOULD BE A. A PUBLIC. WRITTEN CENSURE REPUBLICA RECOMMEND OF REPRIMAND. ANOTHER. TYPE OF SANCTION WOULD BE AN ACT. OF PROBATION. WITH A STATE SENTENCE OF SUSPENSION SAY THIRTY SIXTY DAYS. WHERE THE LAWYER COULD NOT? PRACTICE IN. ONCE THAT TERM WAS FULFILLED IN THE MATTER WOULD BE CLOSE. THERE'S ALSO ACTUAL OF SUSPENSION. IN A IN A CONTEXT LIKE WHAT WERE YOU MAY BE CONSIDERING HERE A SUSPENSION MIGHT BE WITH OR WITHOUT PAY. OVER DEPRIVATION OF CERTAIN. RIGHTS PERKS. COMMITTEE ASSIGNMENTS THE BUDGET CUTS. OF. IT'S LIKE THAT THAT THE. PRESIDENT PRO TEM OF THE SPEAKER MIGHT. CLOSE. AS I SAID THE ULTIMATE SANCTION IN BOTH OF THOSE GAMES WOULD BE. DISBARMENT OR REMOVAL. FROM FROM THE BENCH. ALSO IN TERMS OF THE CONDITIONS OF THE PROBATION REALLY RUNS THE GAMUT SHOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO THE KIND OF CONDUCT THAT. IS BEING CONSIDERED. CERTAINLY THE. ETHICAL TRAINING WOULD BE. OF SIGNIFICANT. OF TRAINING WHICH IS MANNED MANDATORY ANYWAY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ON. SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE BULLRING BULL BULLYING. ANGER MANAGEMENT. SENSITIVITY TRAINING ROOM THE WHOLE GAMUT WHATEVER. AND THIS WOULD APPLY IN A CRIMINAL CONTEXT CASES AS WELL WERE AN INDIVIDUAL'S PLACED ON PROBATION. TYPICAL CASE WOULD BE IN A DRIVING UNDER THE INFLUENCE CASE THEY WOULD HAVE TO COMPLETE SOME KIND OF OFF THE WHOLE SCHOOL. MEANING. I AM VERY HAPPY TO REPORT THAT WITH RESPECT TO THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. THE WHOLE IDEA OF PREVENTION. IS VERY MUCH AT THE FOUR. I KNOW THAT THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND ALSO OF THE DISTRICT COURT'S. HAVE A PRETTY EXTENSIVE. TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR NEW EMPLOYEES AND ALSO FOR NEW. NEW JUDGES. I KNOW THE NINTH CIRCUIT HAS A DESIGNATED OMBUDSMAN. TO HANDLE. COMPLAINTS UNDER CERTAIN. THE. REPORTING PROTOCOLS. OF. THOSE. SYSTEMS. JUST GETTING BACK BRIEFLY TO THE SANCTIONS ON SENTENCING SCHEMES. TYPICALLY IN A CASE. IN A CRIMINAL CASE A JUDGE WOULD NOT GET ANY KIND OF IN THE PENDING INVESTIGATION AS YOU WOULD IN THE CORPORATE. OR PUBLIC CONTACTS WOULD GET A PROVISIONAL OFFICER'S REPORT THAT WOULD DETAIL THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE OFFENSE THE GRAVITY OF THE OFFENSE. OF PRIOR VIOLATIONS WOULD WEIGH VERY HEAVILY. AND GENERALLY EVERY SYSTEM I'VE SEEN HAS A PROGRESSIVE. DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM. MAYBE FOR THE CONDUCT THAT IS NOT SO AGGRAVATED. FIRST TIME OFFENSE. THE. SOME KIND OF CENSURE OF THE MOVING UNDER SUSPENSION AMOUNT TO DISBARMENT SO THAT. THAT WEIGHS VERY HEAVILY. WHEN A JUDGE LOOKS AT A CASE. AND IS TRYING TO FASHION AN APPROPRIATE REMEDY. OTHERS ALSO THE QUESTION OF A PERFORMANCE ON PROBATION. WHEN YOU GIVE SOMEONE A BREAK. OF THAT I JUST SAW THE SALOONS THE COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO SOMEONE I KNOW WHEN THEY DON'T COMPLY WITH THE TERMS OF PROBATION THAT'S YET ANOTHER OFFENSE. FOR WHICH ADDITIONAL PUNISHMENT. CAN BE IMPOSED. BY THE BIG THE ISSUE RIGHT NOW. AS I SEE IT LOOKING AT THE THAT THE. SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON ON CAMPUSES AND REALLY I THINK IT APPLIES TO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. IS THE WHOLE NOTION OF DUE PROCESS. AND THE HALLMARK OF THE DUE PROCESS SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL IN THIS COUNTRY HAS BEEN NOTICE. AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. THE. BROAD SORT OF A CATEGORY. WHAT PROCESSES DO IN A PARTICULAR? CASE. CERTAINLY NOTICE WOULD INCLUDE THE DETAILING THE SPECIFICS OF THE ALLEGATION. IT RAISES SOME SENSITIVITIES AS TO CONFIDENTIALITY AND. THE WILLINGNESS OF A COMPLAINANT. TO REALLY THE. HE'LL COME OUT AND BE PUBLIC WITH HER WITH THEIR. COMPLAINT. ANOTHER ASPECT OF THE DUE PROCESS IS ACCESS TO WITNESS STATEMENTS AND DOCUMENTS AFFORD THAT OPPORTUNITY. TO THE PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED OF A. ANY KIND OF HARASSMENT. TO BE ABLE TO EXAMINE. STATEMENTS AND ANY DOCUMENTS AND WHATEVER IS IN. IN THE RECORD. ALSO OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD WOULD INCLUDE. THE RIGHT TO MAKE STATEMENTS TO AN INDEPENDENT FACT FINDING INVESTIGATOR AND ALSO TO THE JUDICATA BODY. WHETHER THAT'S A SPECIAL COMMITTEE THAT'S MAKING REPORT TO THE FINAL. ADJUDICATIVE A BODY OR SOMETHING ELSE BUT. I THINK THE LITERATURE SPEAKS TO THE. FACT FINDING THE. INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP BEING SEPARATE FROM THE JUDICATA FROM BODY. ODOR TENDS TO BE THERE WOULD TEND TO BE A CONFLICT OF INTEREST. YOU'RE BOTH A FINDER OF FACT. AND A ANY JUROR IN A SENSE. WELL THE OTHER AREA THAT I THINK IS VERY SENSITIVE. IS THE WHOLE AREA AND THIS IS IN OUR IN OUR SIXTH AMENDMENT. RIGHT TO CONFRONT AND CROSS EXAMINE WITNESSES AT SOME TRYING TO. IN OUR US. CONSTITUTION. OF. THE COURTS HAVE DEALT WITH THAT IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND VERY SENSITIVE CASES I CAN SPEAK TO CHILD MOLESTATION CASES WERE. THE LAW HAS DEVELOPED TO WHERE THERE CAN BE VIDEOTAPED TESTIMONY. A SCREEN BEING USED TO BLOCK. BE COMPLAINING FROM SEEING THE RESPONDENT. THE TESTIMONY BEING GIVEN IN SEPARATE ROOMS ARE DIFFERENT WAYS OF HANDLING. OF THOSE TYPES OF SITUATIONS. ALSO TO PRESERVE THE THE NOTION OF PRIVACY AND CONFIDENTIALITY CERTAINLY. AN EDUCATED BODY WOULD HAVE THE OPTION HAVING AN OPEN. OR CLOSED HEARING CERTAINLY IN IN IN JUVENILE CASES ARE CLOSED HEARINGS UP UNTIL QUITE RECENTLY IF THERE'S CONSENT OPEN UP. OF THE COURT ROOM. OF. SO FINALLY I WOULD SAY THE B. FINDINGS THAT ARE MADE. UP BY THE JUDICATA BODY SHOULD BE DETAILED. AND SUPPORTED BY THE EVIDENCE AND SHOULD SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION. OF THAT EDUCATED OF THE BODY. AND SHOULD BE COMMENSURATE WITH. ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS. WITH OTHER SIMILAR KINDS OF CASES ON THE PUNISHMENT. THAT. WAS IMPOSED ON THOSE EARLIER CASES IT HAS TO BE SOME KIND OF. A BALANCE AND BELIEVE ME. THAT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY. TO DO OF MAIL AS A JUDGE YOU TRY TO YOU TRY TO TREAT EVERYONE THE SAME. BUT EVERYONE'S DIFFERENT AND THE FACTS ARE ALWAYS. VERY DIFFERENT BUT IN YOUR OWN MIND YOU TRY TO BALANCE. AND ARRIVE AT A AN APPROPRIATE. SENTENCE. BUT PART OF THE FINDINGS ARE YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE THE BURDEN OF PROOF. GENERALLY IN CIVIL CASES OF COURSE IT'S A BY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE IS SLIGHTLY MORE EVIDENCE. ON ONE SIDE AS OPPOSED TO THE OTHER. IN CRIMINAL CASES OF COURSE IT'S A PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT. AND ENTER IN IN BETWEEN. THERE'S SOMETHING CALLED CLEAR AND CONVINCING EVIDENCE THAT DOESN'T APPLY THAT OFTEN BUT IT'S. SOMETHING THAT. THE ADJUDICATIVE FOR THE EDUCATORS FIRMLY CONVINCED. THAT THE EVIDENCE A. WEIGHS IN FAVOR OF SOME KIND OF. FINDING. AND I THINK IN SOME SITUATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THE SEVERITY OF THE OFFENSE LIKE DISBARMENT REMOVE HOME OFFICE. US SOMEBODY'S BY USE THAT MORE. STRINGENT. BURDEN OF PROOF. SIMILAR TO THAT WOULD BE. THE QUESTION OF UNANIMITY. AND THAT IN SOME WAY. MAY ALL. BERMAIN NULLIFY WITH THE REALLY THE BURDEN OF PROOF IS. IF YOU HAVE A PANEL OF OF THE. OF THREE LET'S SAY AS THE FINAL ADJUDICATIVE BODY. YOU MAY WANT. TO CONSIDER. EITHER UNANIMITY OR SUPER MAJORITY WHICH I THINK IS IS THE GENERAL RULE. OF. THE FOR THE FOR THE LEGISLATURE SO TWO OUT OF THREE. IN CIVIL CASES ON SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES. IT'S NINE OUT OF TWELVE OR THREE QUARTERS. SO YOU SEE THAT SINCE THINGS ARE. SO VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVE. BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT OR TO AN ABSOLUTE CERTAINTY AS SOME PEOPLE LIKE TO SAY. OF. SOMEWHERE. AROUND BURDEN OF PROOF AROUND A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE WOULD SEEM TO BE THE GENERAL RULE. AND THE MAJORITY. OR SUPER MAJORITY. OF CONCLUSION. BY THE GOVERNING BODY. WOULD BE. I THINK APPROPRIATE PARTICULARLY. IN CASES WHERE TALKING BOUT SUSPENSION OR DISBARMENT WITH A SEVERITY DEFENSES ARE MUCH. GREATER. AGAIN BEARING IN MIND WHAT I SAID EARLIER ABOUT HAVING A. A COMPARATIVE THE REASONING ABOUT THE APPROPRIATE STEPS TO IMPOSE AN AWESOME MINUS SIMILAR CASES. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO SAY SOMETHING ABOUT. ELECTED OFFICIALS SINCE. AND WHEN ONE SENSE I WAS AN ELECTED OFFICIAL ON THE BALLOT ABOUT THREE TIMES AND SAY THE CALIFORNIA. AND I THINK. AS AN INDEPENDENT THE. BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT I THINK THE COURTS TEND TO DIFFER. BUT I'M I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON ON ELECTION LAW THIS ONE OF A. OF ELECTED OFFICIALS. BUT OVER TIME I THINK. THE COURTS REALLY FEEL THAT. THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SHOULD REALLY BE ABLE TO DETERMINE ITS OWN RULES. ANNA SO N. AS LONG AS THERE'S A MODICUM OF DUE PROCESS HOWEVER. THAT IS BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM. I THINK COURTS ARE NOT GOING TO INTERCEDE. I THINK A THE SENSES I SEE IT IS THAT. IF THERE IS A. THE. CALL. FOR SOMEONE TO BE PARTICULARLY REMOVED FROM OFFICE. OF THAT MAY BE SOMETHING FOR THE COLLECTORS THE ELECTORATE TO DECIDE. OF. AND THE COURTS ARE GOING TO I THINK IN MOST INSTANCES DIFFER. TWO OF. THE DECISIONS. OF A LEGISLATIVE BODY TO DISCIPLINE ONE OF ITS MEMBERS. AGAIN I'M NOT AN EXPERT LISTEN I'M SURE. STAFF COULD FIND. A CATALOG OF CASES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ON HOW YOU DEAL. WITH THIS. BUT I THINK AS LONG AS THERE'S A MODICUM OF DUE PROCESS AND FAIRNESS. BUT ONE CASE I THINK I SAW. IN THE MEMO THAT WAS CIRCULATED TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW DEALT WITH THREE LEGISLATORS WHEN CALIFORNIA BACK IN NINETEEN OH FIVE WHO ACCEPTED BRIBES. AND WITHIN A MATTER A COUPLE MONTHS THEY WERE MOVED IN. THE THE COURT SAID SOMETHING TO THE EFFECT AS LONG AS THE. LEGISLATURE FOLLOWED ITS RULES THAT'S ENOUGH TO PROCESS. SO DUE PROCESS SYMBOL TO PROCEDURAL SENSE. AS WELL AS IN A SUBSTANTIVE SENSE WHAT'S FAIR. REALLY IS SOMETHING THAT. IS NOT REALLY FIXED. IN THE LOFT IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE USE WE'LL YOU KNOW IT WHEN YOU SEE IT. BUT IT GOES BACK TO YOU KNOW WAS THIS A FAIR PROCESS WAS THE THE INDIVIDUAL HAVE A CHANCE TO BE HEARD. WAS THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY INDEPENDENT. OF. AND THE WAS THEIR DECISION. AT THE END OF THE DAY BASED ON. FACTS THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED. BY SOME LEVEL OF BURDEN OF PROOF. I THINK DOING THAT I THINK THAT THE. THE COURT WOULD VERY LIKELY FIND THAT THE PROCESS THAT WAS DUE WAS INDEED RENDERED. SO THAT THAT CONCLUDES MY OVERALL SORT OF GENERAL COMMENTS AND OLDER VERY GENERAL AND YOU HAVE OTHER. OF SPEAKERS WHO I KNOW ARE MUCH MORE QUALIFIED TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE. SENSITIVITIES OF. THAT YOU ALL ARE DEALING WITH HERE BUT I'D BE HAPPY TO. ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OF ANY OF THE MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE. THANK YOU KNOW AND I AM GOING TO ASK THE PANEL WITH THEIR QUESTIONS AND I ALSO WANT TO LET EVERYBODY KNOW THAT. THE. JUSTICE HAS. VERY GRACIOUSLY OFFERED TO STICK AROUND THERE ARE OTHER PANELS AND THEN TO BE CALLED BACK UP IF BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD WE HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS FOR HIM. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU BEFORE I MOVE TO EVERYBODY ELSE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE YOU'LL WANT TO ANSWER LATER RATHER THAN NOW SO I'LL GIVE YOU THAT OPTION. YOU MENTIONED THAT THE MOST OF THE TIME WITH DUE PROCESS INCLUDES. THE ACCUSED BEING ABLE TO REVIEW SORT OF THE CASE AGAINST THEM BY LOOKING AT THE INVESTIGATION NOW WE DO NOT ALLOW THAT IN THE ASSEMBLY SO THEY'RE THE. THE ACCUSES INTERVIEWED AND THEY MIGHT BE ASKED ABOUT ABOUT. TESTIMONY OF OTHER WITNESSES BUT THEY'RE NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO LOOK AT. THAT TESTIMONY I BELIEVE OUT OF. DESIRE TO PROTECT THE IDENTITY OF WITNESSES AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ABOUT THAT AND AND IF YOU THINK THAT THAT'S A FATAL FLAW OR SOMETHING THAT WE CAN. SORT OF WORK AROUND BASED ON THE THE PROTECTIVE DESIRES YEAH I DON'T THINK IT'S A FATAL FLAW TO BEGIN WITH BUT I THINK SOME KIND OF SUMMARY OF THE TESTIMONY. IT COULD EVEN BE ANONYMOUS I SUPPOSE. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT'S A CYNIC QUINTANA OF DUE PROCESS TO ACTUALLY. OF REVIEW THE ACTUAL STATEMENTS AND DISCLOSE THE IDENTITY LOTUS SOON THAT MANY TIMES THE COMPLAINANTS ARE ANONYMOUS. AND WISH TO REMAIN ANONYMOUS. AND IT DOESN'T TAKE. UP VERY MUCH INTUITION TO FIGURE OUT WHO THAT PERSON MIGHT BE FROM A SET OF FACTS. SO IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I DON'T THINK IT'S IT'S A FABLE FLAW BUT I THINK AT SOME POINT. AND THE WAY THAT. YOU KNOW I'VE SEEN THIS DEALT WITH A GRIN CRIMINAL CASES INVOLVING CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS. IS THE THE. RESPONDENTS ATTORNEY. WOULD BE GIVEN ACCESS IN UNDER CONTROLLED CONDITIONS. TO A STATEMENT FOR SUMMARY. OF WITHOUT HAVING THE ACTUAL CLIENT. SEE THOSE STATEMENTS. SO IT'S REALLY. IT'S REALLY AGAIN NOT A BALANCE. THANK YOU PRESSURE MENTAL. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOU POSED THE QUESTION WITH REGARD TO ANONYMOUS COMPLAINANTS AND AND THE DUE PROCESS ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH JUSTICE MARINA FOR JOINING US AND FOR THE TIME AND THOUGHT YOU PUT INTO. THE. COMMENT YOU SHARED WITH US. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE PROGRESS OF DISCIPLINARY SYSTEM WE'VE HEARD THAT FROM OTHER EXPERTS HAVE COME ON BEFORE US IN IN THE DOCUMENTS THAT WE'VE. REVIEWED I'M CURIOUS AS YOU TALK ABOUT SANCTIONS AND WHO DECIDES. THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE UP BEFORE THE COURT SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA ALL THE EXAMPLES FROM DISBARMENT. ON DOWN BOMB ARE THOSE PRE ESTABLISHED IS THAT UP TO THE ADJUDICATIVE BODY TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT FITS WHAT SCENARIO? HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN TO KIND OF? GOOD INTERESTING QUESTION KIND OF A COMBINATION OF BOTH BECAUSE SOMETIMES. WITH RESPECT TO THE FACTORS IN AGGRAVATION. OF THAT WOULD PERTAIN TO AN UNDERLYING OFFENSE THOSE WOULD BE SET OUT IN STATUTE IN MARKS. IN RULES OF COURT AND THIS IS BOTH IN THE FEDERAL SYSTEM IN IN THE IN THE STATE. OF SYSTEM SO THEY WOULD BE. SET OUT. I WANTED THEY SAY SOMETHING ABOUT. THE SPECTRUM CONCERN THE SEVERITY OF THE. OF THE CONDUCT. AND I THINK THE CIVIL LAW IS QUITE CLEAR ON THIS I MEAN IF YOU HAVE. NO ONE REALLY AGGRAVATED. INSTANCE WITH NO PRIORS THAT'S ENOUGH AND I ULTIMATE SANCTION. OF THE NOTION OF A PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE STARTING OUT WITH THE LIGHTEST SENTENCE WOULD APPLY WORDS MERITED WHERE THE NO PRIOR. OFFENSES AND THEN. IN HIM HARASSMENT WORKPLACE HARASSMENT CASES OR SOMETHING KNOWN AS STRAIGHT STRAIGHT COMMENT. A STRAY COMMENT CLUB MIGHT NOT EVEN BE ACTIONABLE. BUT IF IT'S SEVERE ENOUGH AND IT PROCESS. THEN YOU HAVE AN ACTIONABLE CASE SO I MEAN THE SPECTRUM OF A. YOU KNOW WHAT GOES ON IN IN THE WORKPLACE MEAN JUST WITH ALL OVER THE PLACE. BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WILL ONE. AGGRAVATED INSTANCE COULD RESULT IN THIS APARTMENT FOR REMOVAL. AT STATE PRISON. IN A CRIMINAL CASE THANK YOU. SENATOR MOYLAN. THANK YOU TO JUDGE MARINO YOU'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING ON THE STATE SUPREME COURT TO YOUR. SORT OF HAVE BEEN AT THE PINNACLE OF A CAREER AND YOU'VE HAD A CHANCE TO LOOK AT THE STATE AND. WE WE'VE DISCUSSED CULTURE. A LOT HERE IN THE WORKPLACE BUT WE'VE ALSO GOT A LOT OF LAWS. ABOUT. HOW TO DEAL WITH INDIVIDUALS ON COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THERE BUT? WE'VE GOT SOME HIGH SCHOOLS IN THE ROOM. AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT THERE'S A READY AT A YOU KNOW A PROBLEM ON THE HIGH SCHOOL CAMPUS SO HOW DO WE. START ADDRESSING. CULTURE. BEFORE WE GO INTO CAREERS HOW DO WE. HOW DO WE STAY YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE ANY WISDOM FROM? ALL OF YOUR YEARS OF WONDERFUL WORK FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YEAH WELL IT IS NICE IS A MENTIONED AT LEAST AT THE COURT LEVEL I MEAN I THINK. SOME KIND OF A SENSITIVITY TRAINING AND WHAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT'S WRONG. IT'S NEVER TOO SOON TO TO INCULCATE THAT. AND STUDENTS I MEAN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT KIDS IN PUBERTY ALREADY. AND A LOT OF BULLYING COMING THEIR STATUTES AGAINST BULLYING. SO. I KNOW THAT THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING IS MANDATORY CALIFORNIA FOR ALL EMPLOYERS I'VE TAKEN IT SEVERAL TIMES. AND IT MAY BE WISE TO TO HAVE THAT. YOU KNOW MEMBER THE WHOLE SEX ED CLASSES AND STUFF. THAT. I THINK ESPECIALLY AS YOU SAY IS THE IS THE CLIMATE HAS CHANGED. I THINK YOU KNOW THE TRAINING WITH RESPECT THE BULLYING AND SEXUAL HARASSMENT THINGS ARE REALLY OFFENSIVE. OF NEVER TOO SOON. TO GET INTO THAT. EVEN AT THE MIDDLE MIDDLE SCHOOL LEVEL I WOULD SAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. YOU ARE SOME MEMBER IS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. AND THANK YOU JUST AS MODEL FOR ALL OF YOUR SERVICE TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND ON THE OUR SUPREME COURT. I SINCERELY APPRECIATE OUT ALL OF THEM SPECIALLY AS AN ATTORNEY. IT WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF CONDUCT MY QUESTION HAS TO DO WITH THE THE. THE POSITIONS OF THE PERPETRATOR AND THE VICTIM. ARE ONE THING IS TO TALK ABOUT THEM. THE HARASSMENT BETWEEN TWO INDIVIDUALS BUT WHEN THE PERPETRATOR IS IN A POSITION OF POWER OVER THE VICTIM. HOW IT WORKS? WHAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY THAT THAT SORT OF A CASE WOULD BE HANDLED? WELL I THINK GO WITH A PERSON IN POWER. THE CONCEPT IS REALLY NOT A VALID. CONSENT IT'S IT'S COERCED. IN MOST INSTANCES AND THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS THAT WE NEED. THE PEOPLE NEED IT THE MOST TRAINING OTHER PEOPLE IN POWER WHETHER LEGISLATOR A CHARGER. CORPORATE EXECUTIVE SO. YOU KNOW TRUE TRUE CONSENT UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES IS VERY SUSPECT IN MY VIEW. AND ACTUALLY THAT WOULD BE A FACTOR IN AGGRAVATION. BUT SOMEONE VIOLATED A POSITION OF TRUST OVER THAT. THE VICTIM. THE QUESTIONS WERE ASKED BY THE CHAIR AND THE COACH HERE SPECIFICALLY HAVING TO DO WITH THE ALLEGATIONS OR THE EVIDENCE. IF. IF THERE IS ONE THING IS DURING THE INVESTIGATIONS TO HOW MUCH INFORMATION IS GIVEN. TO TO THE PERPETRATOR. IF NOW THERE IS A HEARING A DUE PROCESS HEARING. TO EXPEL THEM TO SPEND THEM. AT THAT POINT. SHOULD EVIDENCE BE PROVIDED. FORT TO ALLOW FOR TRUE DUE PROCESS WHICH INCLUDES CROSS EXAMINATION. AND EXAMINATION OF THE EVIDENCE YOU KNOW THAT'S A GOOD POINT AND I THINK THERE HAS TO BE SOME RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN. V. CONTEMPLATED THE SEVERITY THE WELL THE THE SEVERITY OF THE OFFENSE THE CONTEMPLATED I THINK MORE DUE PROCESS IS DUE. WHETHER THAT EXTENDS TO PROVIDING THE FULL STATEMENTS OF THE WITNESSES. UP IS ANOTHER QUESTION IT VERY WELL MAY. BUT I THINK WHEN YOU'RE ON THE ON THE LOWER END OF THE SCALE. I THINK AS LONG AS YOU HAVE A MODICUM OF DUE PROCESS. OF. IT'S BEEN PROBABLY NEEDS IT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGOR. BUT THE MORE HE GET INTO THE. THE HEAVIER SANCTIONS. BUT I THINK. OF. FIRST WHILE THEY'RE GONNA BE LAWYERS UP TO THE LAWYERS ARE GOING TO BE WANTING THAT INFORMATION. OF SO THAT THE I THINK I THINK MORE DUE PROCESS WOULD BE DO IT ON A. WHAT THE PUNISHMENT IS GONNA BE MORE SEVERE? IN MY MY. LAST QUESTION. HAD UNDER DUE PROCESS ALSO IS. WHICH YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SPECTRUM OF DISCIPLINE FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. BUT IN ONE INSTANCE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE COULD BE SUFFICIENT. BUT. A HIGHER BURDEN WHEN THE DISCIPLINE IS GOING TO BE MORE SEVERE. COMING UP TO. YOU TALKED ABOUT CLEAR CONVINCING AND. AND ALSO THE THE UNANIMITY OR SUPER MAJORITY. SO DO DO YOU FEEL THAT DEPENDING ON WHAT THE DSCIPLINE IS GOING TO BE THEN THE PREPONDERANCE OR THE THE THE THE. ROOF IS GOING TO BE. IS GOING TO VERY DEPART DEPENDING ON WHAT THE THE THE. THE FINAL DISCIPLINE IS GOING TO BE. YOU KNOW I I THINK YOU CAN HAVE IT ANY KIND OF SYSTEM. I THINK PREPONDERANCE IS PROBABLY GOOD ACROSS THE BOARD. BUT FOR THE MORE AGGRAVATED THE SANCTION. I THINK YOU WANT SOMETHING LIKE A SUPER MAJORITY. OF YOU KNOW CRIMINAL CASES IT'S A UNANIMOUS JURY. A VERDICT. IN CIVIL CASES IT'S IT'S NINE OUT OF TWELVE. OF WHICH IS LIKE IT IS I GUESS IT'S IT'S MORE THAN A SUPER MAJORITY AT SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT IN ORDER TO RENDER. A VERDICT SO IN MY VIEW THIS IS JUST MY VIEW. THAT THE THE BURDEN OF PROOF. AND THE UNANIMITY QUESTION CAN BE PLAYED AROUND WITH. AND AND YOU MAY WANT. A HIGHER UNANIMITY VOTE. FOR THE MORE SERIOUS FOR THIS VERY SPECIAL. TYPES OF OF CASES. THE LITTLE BALL DISBARMENT OR OR. EXPULSION. I THINK THAT WOULD SATISFY THE PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE THAT YOU KNOW. I'M THINKING THAT. YOU'RE ABLE TO PERSUADE. YOU KNOW. OBTAIN AS A SUPER MAJORITY. IS THAT BODY REALLY GONNA LOOK AT. THE ACTUAL THING IN A WAY. PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE VERSUS CLEAR CONVINCING THOSE ARE ALL KIND OF FIVE OF. BUT MORE FOR THIS CONCEPT OF A PREPONDERANCE IS FIFTY PERCENT PLUS ONE. BUT CLEARLY CONVINCING INSIST WHAT FIRM CONVICTION EVEN YOU KNOW PROOF BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT LOT OF LAWYERS KILLERS AND THAT'S NINETY PERCENT. BUT THE LAW DOESN'T DEFINE IT THAT WAY IT'S LIKE. YOU'RE. YOU DON'T HAVE A DAY A REASONABLE DOUBT ABOUT THE GUILT OF THAT PERSON. I THINK A SUPER MAJORITY IS IS PROBABLY ENOUGH. OF. TO FIND THE ULTIMATE SANCTION. AND I DID SAY THAT WAS MY LAST QUESTION. HOW OFTEN TO GET A QUESTION HOW MANY TIMES YOU GET THE QUESTION THE JUDGE I WONDER THAT IS THAT IS AND THE BUT ALSO TO THE SUPREME GO TO CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT SIDE? THAT'S RIGHT I WOULD DO WANT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF. MAY MADAM CHAIR. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE RIGHTS OF THE CONSTITUENCY YEAH THEY HAVE ELECTED A REPRESENTATIVE TO REPRESENT THEM. AS FLAWED AS THAT REPRESENTATIVE MAY BE. AND. EIGHT THE WE'RE TALKING PERHAPS ABOUT TWO DIFFERENT STANDARDS WE AS A BODY SAYING WE DON'T WANT TO INCLUDE YOU IN THE DECISION MAKING. BUT THEN YOU HAVE A CONSTITUENCY THAT NO LONGER HAS REPRESENTATION. ON WITH THE BODY. AND HOW DO YOU BALANCE THOSE ARE HOW DO YOU RECOMMEND THAT WE BALANCE THOSE THOUGH I THINK I THINK THE PEOPLE ARE VERY FORGIVING RIGHT. LEAVE THE ELECTORS ARE VERY. VERY FORGIVING. OF I DON'T KNOW WHAT. WE KNOW WHAT THE ANSWER IS. TO THAT. OF. IT'S IT IS A CONCERN. YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN JUST YOU KNOW SOME OF THE COMES TO MIND RIGHT NOW. AS I SIT HERE IS. WHEN I WAS ON THE TRIAL BENCH IF IF A LAWYER MESSED UP. I WOULD TAKE IT OUT OF THE LAWYER AND NOT ON THE CLIENT. BECAUSE THE CLIENT IS INNOCENT. AND THE FACT THAT THE LAWYER MESSES UP THE SANCTION THE LAWYER BUT NOT THE CLIENT LISTS THAN SOME OTHER CLIENT IS DONE. HAS BEEN YOU KNOW ALSO IN CAHOOTS WITH THE LORD OF. THE DELAY WHATEVER. SO THAT'S ALWAYS MY MY VIEW YOU KNOW. PUNISH THE ONE WHO DID THE WRONGDOING. BUT DON'T PUNISH THE CLIENT AND MAYBE IN THE SENSE. THE ELECTORATE ARE THE CLIENTS OF THE. OF THE LEGISLATOR I MEAN I JUST THOUGHT ABOUT THAT YES RIGHT NOW WHAT I WOULD IT WOULD BE A BIG CONCERN TO ME YOU WANT SOMEHOW AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE MECHANISM IS. FOR THE. PRESIDENT PRO TEM OR THE OR THE SPEAKER. TO. ENSURE THAT THE PEOPLE CONTINUE TO BE REPRESENT AND HAVE A VOICE. OF CERTAIN THAT'S A TOUGH QUESTION. AND THEN FINALLY WE ALSO HAVE TO BALANCE IT WITH. MAKING THE VICTIM HOLE YES BECAUSE THE VICTIM IS THE ONE WHO HAS BEEN INJURED THROUGH VERY DIRECTLY YES THE ELECTORATE. VERY DIRECTLY THE VICTIM HAS BEEN INJURED AND FINDING A WAY FOR THAT VICTIM TO ALSO HAVE JUSTICE RIGHT. AND I THINK THE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR FROM SOMEONE IS GOING TO TALK ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE LATER ON AND THAT'S CERTAINLY ONE MODEL. THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHERE YOU DO CONSIDER THE HARM THAT WAS DONE. ASIDE PUTTING ASIDE WHATEVER PUNITIVE ACTIONS ARE GONNA TAKE. THE HARM THAT WAS DONE HELPING TO FIX THE SITUATION AND HOW COULD YOU MOVE ON. PROBABLY THE BULK OF CASES NOT TO. DIMINISH THE SERVICES OF THESE CASES FILED IN THE BOX BOX OF CASES. BUT TALK ABOUT THE AGGRAVATED ASSAULTS. WHERE THE PARTIES ARE WILLING TO ENTER THAT FRAMEWORK? THAT MIGHT BE THE BOAST THE BEST AND MOST JUST WAY OF RESOLVING THESE CASES. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IF I WANTED TO FOLLOW UP ON KIND OF. MYSTERY AS. LINE OF THINKING. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN OFFICE IS VACANT IS? STAFF CONTINUES AND SO A CONSTITUENT CAN CONTINUE TO CALL A DISTRICT OFFICE AND AND HAVE YOUR CONSTITUENT SERVICES THE LCMS IS OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE THE SYSTEM OFFICES ARE STILL OPEN HERE. BUT THOSE CONSTITUENTS DON'T HAVE A VOTE. ON A BILL ON THE FLOOR ON THE BUDGET AND SO IT REALLY IS. A CONUNDRUM ON IN TERMS OF HOW AND WE'RE IN A SITUATION NOW WHERE THERE ARE CONSTITUENTS WHO HAVE BUILT THEIR SIMPLY MEMBER AND THEIR SENATOR. ON LEAVES ARE HAVING TAKING SO THERE IS. NOW NO REPRESENTATION ON TERMS OF ACTUAL VOTES THE LAST PIECE I WAS GOING TO ADD THIS IN TERMS OF FIGURE OUT THIS BALANCE AND HOW WE DON'T PUNISH THE CONTENT CONSTITUENCY. IS RECOGNIZING THAT THIS IS SUCH AN INSULAR WORKPLACE. THAT IF YOU YOU KNOW THERE IS ONE STATE CAPITAL. AND AND HOW WE CREATE THAT SENSE OF BALANCE AND PROTECTION FOR THE EMPLOYEES. IF IT INDEED IS AN EMPLOYEE WHO WAS THE VICTIM THIS WHOLE WORLD IN WHICH WE WORK IS VERY INSULAR FOR BOTH THE EMPLOYEES MEMBERS OF THE THIRD HOUSE. WHO'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN THIS CONVERSATION AS WELL AND SO THAT'S THE THIRD CONSTITUENCY I THINK THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO SEE HEAR AND PROTECT AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY. ARE REPRESENTED. ALSO THROUGH DUE PROCESS AS WE BUILD THIS OLD SYSTEM FIVE ONE TO ADD THAT PEACE BUT IT'S. IT'S SO VERY GRAY. YOU SENATOR LABOR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR JUST MARINO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY AND SHARING YOUR INSIGHTS. I AM NOT AN ATTORNEY BUT WHEN I WAS IN THE LABOR MOVEMENT I WORKED AT A LOCAL UNION EITHER AS A REPRESENTATIVE OR AS THE PRESIDENT FOR TWENTY YEARS SO I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK ON THOUSANDS OF GRIEVANCES OVER THE YEARS. WE ALWAYS. ADVOCATED FOR PROGRESSIVE DISCIPLINE IT WAS IN ALL OF OUR CON. CONTRACTS HOWEVER THERE WERE. THINGS THAT SOMEONE MIGHT DO AN EMPLOYEE MIGHT DO. AND THAT GOES TO YOUR COMMENT ABOUT THE SEVERITY OF THE CONTACT. CONDUCT THAT WOULD CAUSE IMMEDIATE FIRING MY MY QUESTION IS IS IT WHEN WE'RE DEVELOPING OUR POLICIES AND OUR PRACTICES. SHOULD WE INCLUDE SOMETHING ABOUT. WHAT WE USED TO HAVE IN OUR CONTRACTS WAS? THESE PARTICULAR THINGS BEHAVIORS COULD CAUSE IMMEDIATE TERMINATION AND WE ALWAYS YOU KNOW IT INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO DO YOU THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO OUTLINE. ANYTHING THAT COULD CAUSE TERMINATION OR EXPULSION. YOU KNOW I I I DON'T THINK SO OKAY I'VE ALWAYS BEEN AGAINST THE THIS IS ME. AGAINST MANDATORY MINIMUM SENTENCES. OF PARTICULAR THE SPECTER DRUG CASES IN OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT. IT REALLY TIES THE HANDS OF THE JUDGE SO. I DON'T THINK A RULE THAT WOULD TIE THE HAND THAT SALUTE LEAGUE. OF THE JUDICATA BODY WOULD BE A GOOD ONE YOU GOT A. I MEAN WE'RE ALL OF. THIS IS THIS IS A SYSTEM OF. PEOPLE. YOU KNOW DEALING WITH EACH OTHER AND. THINGS GOING AWRY. THEN I THINK THAT THE. THE WAY THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE NOTICED THAT SOMETHING IS REALLY BAD IS BASED ON PRECEDENT WHAT HAPPENED AND. IN PRIOR CASES AND SO FORTH. BUT A MANDATORY OF JUST LETTING PEOPLE WOULD KNOW THAT IF THEY DID SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT WOULD BE. REMOVED BUT REQUIRING IT. MANDATORILY. I DON'T THINK SO FAIR ENOUGH HOWEVER YOU WOULD BE SURPRISED AT WHAT PEOPLE THINK THEY CAN DO IN IT NOT HANG AND GET NOT ANY DISCIPLINE. IT'S A LITTLE SHOCKING SOMETIMES AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE I I HEARD WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER. THAT WHEN WE ARE. MAKING SURE THAT SOMEONE ELSE HAD DUE PROCESS WE WANT TO LOOK AT A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE. THREE QUARTERS OF THE BODY AGREEING ON DISCIPLINE WHAT'S THE PROCESS FAIR AND WAS A DECISION BASED ON FACTS. THOSE ARE THE THINGS SHE THE PARAMETERS YOU THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT. EXCEPT FOR THE THREE QUARTERS I THINK OKAY. YOU KNOW THE SUPER MAJORITY DEPENDS ON THE BODY HE MIGHT WANT. TO A MAJORITY THINK IS WHAT SIXTY SIX PERCENT TWO OUT OF THREE. OR THREE OUT OF FIVE WHATEVER. HOWEVER YOU DEFINE WHAT SUPER MAJORITY IS A. THREE QUARTERS COMES FROM OUR CIVIL JUSTICE SYSTEM IN CIVIL CASES. THE SUPER MAJORITY RATHER THAN THREE QUARTERS RIGHT CATCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU I'M IT'S WONDERFUL TO HAVE THE LEGAL INPUT FROM SUCH A HIGH LEVEL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU THAT'S A VERY UNFAIR QUESTION BECAUSE IT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST. ISSUES THAT I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT WITH REGARD TO THIS. WHICH HAS TO DO WITH ARM. OUR NATURE AS A BODY BEING IN THE LEGISLATURE EIGHTY MEMBERS AND IN SORRY IN THE ASSEMBLY EIGHTY MEMBERS AND FORTY IN THE SENATE. WHEN YOU TALKED ABOUT YOUR ROLE AS A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE OCCASIONALLY HAVING TO. DEAL WITH DISCIPLINING OF LAWYERS OR JUDGES UNDERNEATH YOU IT'S VERY DIFFERENT THAN ONE IF YOU WERE DEALING WITH. DISCIPLINE WITH ONE OF YOUR OWN SITTING COLLEAGUES ON THE SUPREME COURT AND YET THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF OUR PROCESS WHEN IT COMES TO CERTAINLY THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF DEALING WITH MEMBERS. ARE COMES DOWN TO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WEIRD WERE DIFFERENT BODY THAN A PRIVATE ORGANIZATION BUT ADVICE IF WE SUGGESTED THAT A PRIVATE COMPANY DEALT WITH A SEXUAL HARASSMENT CLAIM BY PUTTING ALL THE EMPLOYEES IN ONE ROOM. AND HAVING THEM VOTE ON WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE OF THEIR COLLEAGUES WE WOULD SAY THAT THAT WAS LUDICROUS BUT THAT'S THE SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. IN THE LEGISLATURE. AND. BUT AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE OF THE POLITICAL ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE WORK THERE'S ALWAYS A PERCEPTION OF BIAS WHEN IT COMES TO US. BOATING ON WHAT HAPPENS TO ONE OF OUR MEMBERS. AND WE'RE VERY TIED TOGETHER IN TERMS OF NEEDING EACH OTHER FOR VOTES AND THAT SORT OF THING. SO ONE OF THE THE IDEAS THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING ON OUR MODELS THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR. AN OUTSIDE GROUP OF SOME SORT TO AT LEAST MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS. SO THAT. SOME OF THAT PERCEPTION OF BIAS MAYBE CAN BE DIFFUSED OR. NOT THAT WE WOULD SHIRK OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO. IMPOSE OUR OWN DISCIPLINE BUT THAT HAVING SOME KIND OF AN OUTSIDE. BODY OR PERSON OR WHATEVER IT IS. MIGHT BE HELPFUL AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS. AS TO THAT. AND I GO BACK AND FORTH YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I THINK WE NEED TO SHOW THAT WE CAN KIND OF POLICE OURSELVES. AND THAT'S MY WAS I THINK THAT THAT'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE SEEN AS THOUGH THERE WAS ANY ACCUSATIONS OF OF SOME KIND OF BUYERS ARE IN COURT. IMPROPRIETY I JUST WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS IF YOU WANT YOU CAN THINK ABOUT IT AND COME BACK AND TALK ABOUT IT OR WHATEVER YEAH. BEFORE I FORGET YES PLEASE. THAT'S THE INTERESTING CONCEPT BECAUSE YOU'RE I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WHEN YOU ARE JUDGING YOUR PEERS. I MEAN THERE'S THERE COULD BE A CERTAIN ABUSES OF POLITICAL. FAVORS AND WANTING TO GET RID OF SOMEBODY FOR OTHER REASONS UNRELATED TO THE ACTUAL. CONDUCT IF I I DON'T KNOW IF THE AGAIN. IF YOU ACTUALLY NEED AN OUTSIDE BODY OR CERTAINLY THE. IN THE. FOUR JUDGES THERE IS AN OUTSIDE BODY. BUT SERVE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE WHICH COMPRISE OF CITIZENS. OF I THINK APPOINTED BY THE BY THE GOVERNOR AND THE CHIEF JUSTICE. AND THEY MAKE A RECOMMENDATION THAT IS PROBABLY ALWAYS FOLLOWED BY THE SUPREME COURT. SAME THING WITH JUDGE WITH THE LAWYERS. THERE ARE THE STATE BAR. HAS A. SEPARATE. KIND OF JUDICIAL SYSTEM OF OUR HEARINGS JUDGES AND REVIEW JUDGES. SO BUT IT'S VERY IT'S VERY JUDICIAL LIES IN OTHERS HEARINGS AND. AN APPEAL. BUT THEN THEY MAKE THE RECOMMENDATION TO THE SUPREME COURT. AND THEN WE DECIDE. WHETHER TO FOLLOW OR NOT FOLLOW THE RECOMMENDATION. OF SO I MEAN DEPENDING ON. OF. YOU KNOW HOW MANY. HOW PREVALENT THE THE ISSUE IS YOU WANT TO ESTABLISH A SEPARATE OUTSIDE BODY OR? OR JUST HAVE AN INDEPENDENT FACT FINDER LIKE A LAW FIRM ANA AT HEART BASIS DO SOMETHING AND PRESENTED TO THE COMMITTEE. COMMITTEE CAN REALLY INVESTIGATED I'M OUT MAYBE THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE NOW. BUT TO THE SET UP. PLAY IT IN DEPENDENT BODY I NOT SURE IF I'D GO THAT FAR. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS FOR NOW. THANK YOU VERY MCH LOOK. FOR THE MOMENT BUT I REALLY I I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE CUT TIME AND SIT DOWN AND. AND GIVE US THESE THOUGHTS THAT IS VERY VERY HELPFUL AND IF YOU DON'T MIND I'M STAYING FOR A LITTLE WHILE WE MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE MORE QUESTIONS FOR YOU. THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL WHICH IS ABOUT INVESTIGATING SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS. AMY OPPENHEIMER WHO'S THE AUTHOR OF INVESTIGATING WORKPLACE HARASSMENT AND KEVIN KISSED THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING. IF YOU CAN BOTH COME UP IF YOU WANT TO ADD ANY INTRODUCTIONS BEYOND THAT YOU ARE MORE THAN WELCOME MORE TO TALK ABOUT YOUR ORGANIZATIONS WITH THE PEOPLE WATCHING AT HOME WHO MAY NOT. BE AS INVESTED UNDERSTAND. WHO YOU'RE REPRESENTING? AND I VERY MUCH ALSO APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND TAKING. YOUR DAY TO COME IN AND TALK TO US ABOUT THESE OF THIS VERY IMPORTANT PART OF OUR RESPONSE TO SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS. ME AND I THINK I AM. WE WE DO HAVE A POWER POINT IN ITS HARD TO PART OF IT FOCUSES ON. GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE PART OF HER EMPLOYMENT HOUSING THAT KEVIN KITCHEN IS GOING TO BE. TAKING THE LEAD ON AND THEN WE'RE GONNA OF SEGUE TO. OTHER EXPERIENCE I HAVE AN AND NOT SPEAKING FOR ANYONE ORGANIZATIONS SOME MAYBE WE'LL DO THE INTRODUCTIONS THAT WAY IF IT'S OKAY WITH YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. BUT I'M HAVING KIDS STRUCTURE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING WE ARE THE STATE AGENCY THAT ACCEPTS AND INVESTIGATES AND PROSECUTES. CASES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT AND OTHER FORMS OF. DISCRIMINATION BOTH IN THE WORKPLACE IN HOUSING AND IN OTHER CONTEXTS. THAT'S WHAT WE DO. I'M HERE REALLY TO DISCUSS A WORKPLACE HARASSMENT GUIDE THAT WE PUT TOGETHER AND THIS CAME ABOUT BECAUSE CALIFORNIA UNIQUELY HAS A LEGAL REQUIREMENT. THAT EMPLOYERS CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS OF ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT AND THIS IS DIFFERENT THAN IN FEDERAL LAW. SO SINCE WE HAVE THIS. LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO PREVENT AND. AND REMEDY DISCRIMINATION THAT TAKES THE FORM OF AN-INVESTIGATION AND PLACES AN AFFIRMATIVE REQUIREMENT ON EMPLOYERS TO. INVESTIGATE WE THOUGHT IT WOULD ONLY BE FAIR TO TELL PEOPLE WHAT WE EXPECT IN AN INVESTIGATION. I'M ALSO WERE IN A POSITION OF JUDGING PEOPLE'S INVESTIGATIONS AND IT'S FAIR TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT THOSE. EXPECTATIONS ARE. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE REALIZED AS. MOST PEOPLE HAVE NO IDEA HOW TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION THIS IS NOT THE SITUATION THAT THE LEGISLATURE FINDS ITSELF AND YOU GUYS HAVE HIRED LAW FIRMS TO DO THIS FOR YOU. I'M BUT FOR MANY EMPLOYERS EVEN SURPRISINGLY LARGE EMPLOYERS FOLKS JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO IT. I'M SO WE PUT TOGETHER A PANEL OF EXPERTS INCLUDING AMY OPPENHEIMER AND WE CAME UP WITH THIS WORKPLACE INVESTIGATION GUIDE IT'S PART OF THE MATERIALS THAT ARE ON THE WEBSITE FOR THIS. HEARING. I'M. EVAN. AND THE FIRST THING THAT I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT IS THAT EVEN IF SOMEONE CHOOSES TO FILE A COMPLAINT WITH THE DIFF DFU AGE OR WITH THE EOC. THAT DOES NOT RELIEVE ANY EMPLOYER OF CONDUCTING THEIR OWN INVESTIGATION TO TRY TO GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THE ALLEGATIONS AND MAKE A DETERMINATION ABOUT. WHAT HAPPENED? SO WE HAVE OUR SLIDE SLIGHTLY OUT OF ORDER BIZARRE NAMES THIS IS OUR. THIS IS OUR COMPLAINT FLOW CHART THAT SHOWS WHAT HAPPENS AT THE DF DH AND I JUST INCLUDED THIS AS A REFERENCE FOR THE PUBLIC. I'M IT'S ALSO UP ON OUR WEBSITE AND IT SHOWS YOU ALTHOUGH THE WAYS THAT THINGS CAN HAPPEN AND ONE THING THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WHEN SOMEONE DOES FILE WITH US OR WITH THE EOC. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RESULT IN AN INVESTIGATION PEOPLE HAVE THE RIGHT TO REQUEST THE SO CALLED RIGHT TO SUE. WHICH INVOLVES ABSOLUTELY NO AND NOT LYSIS OR DETERMINATION ON OUR PART THAT IS AN AUTOMATIC FUNCTION. THEY SAY I DON'T WANT YOU GUYS TO INVESTIGATE I WANT MY RIGHT TO GO TO COURT AND I'M GONNA GET IT. I MEAN THEY CAN GET THAT AUTOMATICALLY. VIA THE WEBSITE. OKAY. THESE ARE THE KEY POINTS THAT I'M GONNA HEAD ON VERY BRIEFLY. ONE AFTER THE OTHER SO LET'S MOVE ON TO. DUE PROCESS TIME WE'VE ALREADY HEARD SOME OF THAT TODAY I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT ONE THING. WHICH IS THAT BY AND LARGE UNLESS THERE IS A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN PLACE EMPLOYEES IN CALIFORNIA AND ELSEWHERE ARE NOT ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS AND IN FACT DURING THE TIME THAT WE HAVE SAT HERE. THERE ARE EMPLOYEES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO HAVE BEEN DISCIPLINED AND FIRED WITH NO EXPLANATION AT ALL. ABOUT WHY THAT IS SO AND I JUST WANT TO. RAISE THE CAUTION THAT WE NOT CREATE AN EXPECTATION THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCUSED OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ARE SOMEHOW ENTITLED. TO MORE PROTECTIONS THAN ANY OTHER EMPLOYEE THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH THAT SIDE. I DO THINK THAT DUE PROCESS IS IMPORTANT BOTH FOR FAIRNESS AND FOR THE PERCEPTION OF FAIRNESS I'M IN EXACTLY THE WAYS THAT JUSTICE MARINO HAS. DESCRIBED BUT I'M I JUST WANTED TO CAUTION THE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT. WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION. DUE PROCESS IS WHAT THE EMPLOYER CREATES THERE'S NO INDEPENDENT LEGAL CONTENTS TO THAT TO THAT PHRASE. I'M IN OUR. DO YOU HAVE THE H. GUIDELINES WHICH ARE THE MOST RECENT. GUIDANCE DOCUMENT OF THE SORT THAT WE KNOW OF. WE SAY THAT DUE PROCESS DOES NOT. INVOLVE TELLING A PERSON ACCUSED OF MISCONDUCT OR HARASSMENT. IN ADVANCE WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE AN IMPACT OUR RECOMMENDATION IS THAT THAT NOT HAPPEN THAT YOU. PROVIDED DETAILED AND COMPLETE. LIST OF THE ALLEGATIONS WHEN YOU INTERVIEW WITH THE PERSON WHO'S BEEN ACCUSED BUT THAT YOU NOT PROVIDE THAT IN ADVANCE ABOUT DIFFERS IN SOME WAYS. FROM MY UNDERSTANDING OF CERTAIN OTHER AREAS OF LAW INCLUDING TITLE NINE WHICH I WHERE I THINK IT'S. ON CAMPUSES IT'S MORE COMMON TO PRESENT A KIND OF A LIST OF THE ACCUSATIONS. RIGHT. THE OTHER THING THAT I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT IS IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE FREQUENTLY GET AS PEOPLE WHO WANT US TO INTERVIEW ONE HUNDRED PEOPLE. DUE PROCESS DOES NOT REQUIRE INTERVIEWING PEOPLE WHO DO NOT HAVE. AND ALL KNOWLEDGE OR WHO ARE NOT LIKELY TO HAVE PERSONAL KNOWLEDGE OF THE OF THE EVENTS AND SO THERE IS A LIMIT TO THE NUMBER OF. INTERVIEWS THAT WE EXPECT FOLKS TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION AND OF COURSE. THE OTHER ELEMENT OF DUE PROCESS THAT THERE'S A. THERE'S THE PROCEDURE OF WOMEN OF IS THIS PROCESS FAIR THERE'S A SUBSTANTIVE ELEMENT OF WHAT EXACTLY ARE YOU ALLOWING. THE PARTIES TO DO AND THEN ULTIMATELY IT ALSO REQUIRES FOLKS TO COME TO A REASONABLE AND FAIR CONCLUSION. I'M AND THIS IDEA AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT'S A PROBLEM FOR THIS BODY. IN PARTICULAR BUT IN A VERY SURPRISING NUMBER OF CASES THAT WE SEE. ARE THE INVESTIGATION LEADS ABSOLUTELY NOWHERE THERE'S NO CONCLUSION ONE WAY OR THE OTHER AT THE END OF THE INVESTIGATION AND I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR FOLKS WATCHING THAT THAT IS NOT. AN EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION AND NOT WHAT WE WOULD EXPECT TO SEE. I'M. WHEN IT COMES TO CONFIDENTIALITY I YOU KNOW I THINK JUSTICE MIGHT NOT TOUCHED ON THIS AS WELL. THE SECOND THING YOU TELL SOMEBODY WHAT THE ALLEGATIONS ARE. YOU KNOW WHO HAS A LOT OF THEM I'M AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO HIGHLIGHT TO FOLKS IS THAT. WE WE THROW THE WORD CONFIDENTIALLY CONFIDENTIALITY AROUND AT THE END OF THE DAY BY AND LARGE AND MOST WORKPLACES EVERYBODY KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING. AND IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO GET THAT OUT THERE I'M SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE UNREASONABLE EXPECTATIONS ON THE PART OF PEOPLE WHO COME FORWARD AS MUCH AS WE NEED TO PROTECT THEM. I'M. SO. WITH THANKS TO AMY FOR HELPING ME BRAINSTORM ON THIS ISSUE I DO THINK THAT THERE ARE. THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON EVEN MORE THAN CONFIDENTIALITY ONE IS HOW DO YOU MANAGE THE FALLOUT WHEN PEOPLE FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON AS THEY DO. I'M IN ALMOST EVERY INVESTIGATION SO WHAT KIND OF MESSAGE ARE YOU SENDING TO FOLKS WHEN THEY LEARNED THAT THERE IS AN INVESTIGATION THAT SOMEONE HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S LEVEL THAT UP. ACCUSATION. THEM INTO AND CRUCIALLY HOW DO YOU. PROTECT AND CONVEY YOUR COMMITMENT TO PROTECTING WITNESSES AND PARTIES. FROM RETALIATION AND. SADLY I THINK THAT RETALIATION IS VERY REAL WE FREQUENTLY SEE CASES WHERE THE UNDERLYING CONDUCT MAY NOT IN FACT BE SUBSTANTIATED BUT THE PERSON WHO COMPLAINED DID IN FACT EXPERIENCE RETALIATION FOR BRINGING IT FORWARD AND THAT IS A COMMON OCCURRENCE. THAT I WOULD SAY IN BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS. IT'S ALSO ENTIRELY HUMAN. TO NOT LIKE SOMEBODY WHO HAS ACCUSED HER DOING SOMETHING WRONG. AND SO I THINK THAT AS INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT SOME PLAYERS WE HAVE TO BE VERY CLEAR ABOUT OUR COMMITMENT TO ANTI RETALIATION PRINCIPLES. I'M TIMELINESS IS IMPORTANT IN HERE AND YOU KNOW THIS IS AGAIN FOR. MANY EMPLOYERS WATCHING IF YOU FARM THE INVESTIGATION OUT JUST BE ALERTS TO DELAY. IN GENERAL IF THE ALLEGATION IS VERY SERIOUS EVENT INVOLVES ALLEGATIONS OF FOR EXAMPLE UNWANTED TOUCHING YOU NEED TO TAKE HAS. COME FORWARD IS PROTECTED. GENERALLY WITHIN A FEW DAYS. YOU NEED TO. WERE WITHIN A DAY OR TWO YOU WANT TO CONTACT THE COMPLAINT COMPLAIN AND THANK THEM FOR. ODGING THE COMPLAINT AND EXPLAINING THAT YOU WILL BE CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION ABOUT SOME FACT WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. I'M AND WE TRY AND GET IT DONE WE AT THE DF YES I WOULD LOVE TO GET IT DONE IN A FEW WEEKS AND BY AND LARGE THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR US. BUT FOR EMPLOYERS CONDUCTING INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS OFTEN IT IS NOW THAT'S VERY DEPENDENT ON THINGS LIKE IF SOMEBODY OUT ON LEAVE. SOMEBODY ON VACATION OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE MANY. FACTORS TO BE CONSIDERED THEIR. IMPARTIALITY OBVIOUSLY EVERY INVESTIGATION MUST BE. IMPARTIAL I'M AN EQUALLY IMPORTANT THERE SHOULD NOT BE A PERCEPTION OF PARTIALITY SO THE PERCEPTION OF BIAS I NEVER SOMETHING THAT THIS BODY IS. IS GRAPPLING WITH. THERE IS NO LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO EITHER DO SOMETHING INTERNALLY OR FARM IT OUT TO AN EXTERNAL BODY. IN GENERAL THE HIGHER RANKING THE PERSON WHO IS THE SUBJECT OF THE COMPLAINT. THE MORE CHANCE THAT THERE WILL BE A PERCEPTION THAT THE INSTITUTION ITSELF IS BIASED IN FAVOR OF THAT PERSON. I'M SO THAT'S A FACTOR TO CONSIDER AND DECIDING WHETHER TO GIVE AN INVESTIGATION TO AN OUTSIDE BODY OR TAKE CONDUCTED INTERNALLY. THERE'S SOME THE FACTORS IN THE GUIDELINES ABOUT QUALIFICATIONS AND TRAINING. THERE ARE. SUGGESTIONS ABOUT TYPES OF QUESTIONING AND INEFFECTIVE INVESTIGATION. AND THEN WE GET TO CREDIBILITY DETERMINATIONS AND THIS IS VERY. CRUCIAL BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE MOST FREQUENTLY SEE. AND IS THAT PEOPLE FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE CREDIBILITY DETERMINATIONS THE ABSENCE OF EXTERNAL EVIDENCE OTHER THAN. ONE PERSON SAYS SOMETHING HAPPENED. THE OTHER PERSON SAYS IT DIDN'T. AND OT SET IN SO WE FREQUENTLY SEE EVEN VERY EXPERIENCED INVESTIGATORS WRITING THINGS LIKE THE ISSUE REMAINS IN DISPUTE. NO IT DOESN'T YOU'VE JUST DECIDED THE ISSUE. ANY DECIDED IN FAVOR OF THE PERSON WHO'S BEEN ACCUSED BECAUSE YOU'VE SAID THAT. THAT PERSON THE EVIDENCE IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO ESTABLISH IT. I'M SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE FOCUS ON A LOT WITH OUR OWN STUFF THE DFU CHIN AND EMPOWERING TO MAKE THAT CALL IT'S A TOUGH CALL TO MAKE. WE DON'T LIKE TO THINK THAT PEOPLE ARE LYING TO US. I'M AND I THINK ON A HUMAN LEVEL THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DIFFICULT PROCESS OF AN INVESTIGATION PARTICULARLY WHEN IT INVOLVES SOMEONE THAT YOU KNOW WHICH IS ALMOST ALWAYS THE CASE AND A WORKPLACE. HARASSMENT INVESTIGATION. HERE AND ELSEWHERE. WE TALK ABOUT CREDIBILITY FACTORS IN OUR GUIDANCE AND WE ALSO CAUTION ABOUT THE USE OF DEMEANOR BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT SOCIAL SCIENCE TELLS US IS THAT THERE IS NO ONE DEMEANOR. THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS EXPERIENCED HARASSMENT UP TO AND INCLUDING ASSAULT HAS I'M THAT PERSON MIGHT NOT MAKE EYE CONTACT THAT PERSON MIGHT BE VERY DIRECT THAT PERSON MIGHT BE ANGRY. I'M THAT PERSON MIGHT BE VERY RETIRING. THERE IS NO COMMON THEME TO HELP PEOPLE. RESPOND. BURDEN OF PROOF WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THIS FROM JUSTICE MARINO IN A WORKPLACE. HARASSMENT INVESTIGATION AT THE DF PH WE BELIEVE FINDING SHOULD BE BASED ON A PREPONDERANCE OF EVIDENCE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. WE ARE. WE THINK THAT IS APPROPRIATE BECAUSE THAT'S THE CIVIL LEGAL STANDARD. NOW WHETHER A PARTICULAR EMPLOYER. TAKES ACTION AND WHAT ACTION THEY TAKE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION. BUT IN TERMS OF REACHING A CONCLUSION PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE IS THE STANDARD FOR WORKPLACE HARASSMENT ALLEGATIONS WHICH ARE CIVIL LAW ALLEGATIONS. I'M IS THIS IS INTERESTING AND SOMETHING FOR YOU GUYS TO DEBATE INTERNALLY BUT. THERE IS A DIFFERENT PRACTICES IN TERMS OF WHAT THE INVESTIGATION IS SUPPORT KIND OF RECOMMENDATION IT'S SUPPOSED TO RESULT IN AND VERY FREQUENTLY EMPLOYERS DO NOT WANT LEGAL RECOMMENDED LEGAL CONCLUSIONS OR RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE FORM OF. HARASSMENT TOOK PLACE. INSTEAD THEY WANT FACTUAL CONCLUSIONS WHICH SOMETIMES AMOUNT TO THE SAME THING IT'S I BELIEVE THAT FRED BY A PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE SAID X. Y. Z. TO SALLY. THAT GIVES EMPLOYERS A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY AND. I'M DETERMINING WHAT STEPS TO TAKE WHEN THEY GET THAT FINAL INVESTIGATION REPORT. WE HAVE THE DOCUMENTATION ADVICE THIS IS NOT A VERY LONG DOCUMENT BY THE WAY IT'S EIGHT AND A HALF PAGES BUT. WE TRY TO HIT THAT. WE TRY TO HAVE THE GREATEST HITS INCLUDING ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS ON THESE ARE REALLY TOUGH YOU MIGHT SEE THEM. AND THEY SHOULD BE INVESTIGATED THEY SHOULD NOT DIE ON THE VINE. BUT THE WAY THEY CAN BE INVESTIGATED WILL DEPEND ON THE ALLEGATIONS AND SOMETIMES THE ALLEGATIONS ARE SO VAGUE. BUT YOU CAN'T CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION SOMETIMES THE ALLEGATIONS ARE VERY SPECIFIC AND YOU CAN. OFTEN WHAT CAN BE DONE IF YOU'RE GETTING ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS AS SOMETHING'S GOING ON. I'M YOU CAN CONDUCT WHAT'S CALLED AN ENVIRONMENTAL ASSESSMENT OR SURVEY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT PEOPLE ARE THINKING. I CAN PRETTY MUCH GUARANTEE THAT THAT'S GOING TO STIR THE POT BUT SOMETIMES IT'S WORTH IT AND SOMETIMES IT'S A GOOD. THING FOR AN EMPLOYER TO DO BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE OBVIOUSLY EXPERIENCING SOMETHING. THERE ARE SPECIFIC PROBLEMS IF. ACTUALLY I THINK THAT. THERE'S A TYPO HERE RATHER THAN TARGET IT SOULD BE I'M THE PERSON WHO IS THE ACT. LEVELING THE ACCUSATION. IS THAT WHAT IS THAT WRITING ME. YEAH I THINK OF THE TARGET IS THAT IS A PERSON WHO IS MAKING THE ACAPELLA TARGET OF THE HARASSMENT BY SEA GOT IT GOT IT NOT THE TARGET OF THAT. YES COMPLAINTS GOT IT I'M SOMETIMES PEOPLE ASK YOU NOT TO TAKE ANY ACTION. FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE THAT IS VERY PROBLEMATIC. AND WHAT I TELL PEOPLE IS THAT THIS IS AN UNBELIEVABLY DIFFICULT. SITUATION IT INVOLVES A VERY HUMAN CONSIDERATIONS. BUT CERTAINLY IF THE ACCUSATION IS RELATIVELY MINOR THAN. YOU KNOW COUNSELING WHATEVER. THERE ARE PLENTY OF THINGS THAT YOU CAN DO AS AN EMPLOYER TO KIND OF REMEDY A SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE. I'M WITHOUT TAKING FURTHER ACTION IF. IF THE ACCUSATION IS VERY SERIOUS AND WOULD IF TRUE BE A VIOLATION OF LAW THAN FAILING TO TAKE ACTION WHEN YOU KNOW ABOUT IT CAN EXPOSE THE BODIES TO LIABILITY. WITHOUT SAID THERE ARE VERY HUMAN REASONS WHY PEOPLE DON'T WANT ACTION TO BE TAKEN IN VERY HUMAN REASONS WHY AN EMPLOYER MIGHT DECIDE. TO DO THAT. RETALIATION IS COVERED OBVIOUSLY OF MENTIONED IT. AND. ONE THING THAT I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT ON THIS LAST OF THE SLIDES THAT I HAD IS. THE IMPORTANCE TO MONITOR TO KEEP MONITORING. I'M INTO CHECK BACK IN WITH PEOPLE WHO HAVE LEVELED ACCUSATIONS OF. MISCONDUCT TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT EXPERIENCING RETALIATION BECAUSE IF THEY ARE. THEY'RE VERY UNLIKELY TO COME FORWARD AGAIN AND TO TELL YOU THAT THEY ARE BECAUSE THEY ASSUME THAT YOU NOW. SO REACHING BACK OUT TO SOMEONE WHETHER OR NOT THEIR ACCUSATIONS WERE SUBSTANTIATED OVER THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE DOING OKAY IS A VERY WISE THING FOR EMPLOYERS TO DO. AND SO NOW SORT OF SEGUEING INTO. OUTSIDE OF THE DFG AGE GUIDELINES WHICH I. WAS HAD THE PLEASURE TO BE ABLE TO WORK ON. MY BACKGROUND IS HAVING BEEN A PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY IN THE EIGHTIES DOING US SEXUAL HARASSMENT CASES ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS. AND THEN BEING INTERESTED IN PREVENTION KIND OF WANTING TO REVERSE ENGINEER HOW DID THESE SITUATIONS GET HERE AND. HOW COULD WE DO BETTER TO PREVENT AND RESPOND RATHER THAN LITIGATING IN MY EXPERIENCE LITIGATION WAS NOT REALLY A VERY GOOD SOLUTION? AND SO OVER THE COURSE OF MY CAREER I HAVE. DONE INVESTIGATIONS I'VE TRAINED INVESTIGATORS I WROTE A BOOK ABOUT WORKPLACE INVESTIGATIONS BY FORMED A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR WORKPLACE INVESTIGATORS IT'S NOW AN INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION WITH OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MEMBERS AND. THAT THAT'S THE ASSOCIATION A WORKPLACE INVESTIGATORS AND I GAVE YOU THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES AS PART OF YOUR MATERIALS. AND I'VE TESTIFIED AS AN EXPERT ON MANY OCCASIONS ABOUT INVESTIGATIONS. REALLY WITH THE BELIEF THAT. THERE ARE SO MANY WORKPLACE COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE TO BE DEALT WITH INTERNALLY YOU CAN'T OUTSOURCE ALL OF THEM. AND THE BETTER JOB THAT WE CAN DO WITH THEM THE BETTER WE CAN MAKE THE WORK ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERYBODY AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT OF POLY ANISH BUT. AND FIRST JUST WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THIS WORK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK AND REALLY APPRECIATING THAT YOU'RE TAKING THE TIME TO LISTEN. TO SO MANY OPINIONS AND MAKE CAREFUL DECISIONS. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT INFORMS MY WORK IS. THAT. WE CAN'T PREVENT BET WRONG DOERS WE CAN'T. STOP THE THE HIGHER OR THE ELECTION OF PEOPLE WHO MAY BE BULLIES AND AND MAY DO THINGS THAT. WE WOULD NEVER CONDONE BUT WE CAN DO SOMETHING BETTER RESPONSE. AN INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE MAKES A HUGE DIFFERENCE PEOPLE WHO ARE DO NOT GET A GOOD INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE ARE FURTHER HARM. WHO DO GET A GOOD INSTITUTIONAL RESPONSE MAY VERY WELL BE ABLE TO? GO ON WITH THEIR LIVES IN THEIR JOBS IN A POSITIVE WAY AND. THERE ARE STUDIES ON INSTITUTIONAL BETRAYAL AND AND HOW IT EXACERBATES TRAUMA. AND SO I I THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK AND AND COME TO IT WITH THAT. IN MIND. I LISTEN TO THE PAST. HEARINGS AND. PUT TOGETHER SORT OF A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND POINTS BECAUSE. WHAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT IS NOT THINKING ABOUT SOME OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES THAT MAY COME? OUT OF THE POLICY DECISIONS THAT YOU MAKE IN MAKING SURE THAT. THEIR THOUGHT THROUGH. WE I THINK THAT YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT BOTH THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PERSON WHO WAS THE TARGET AND ALSO THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED. AND. WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THEY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO HOLD BOTH OF THOSE PERSPECTIVES. IN MIND. THE OTHER THING I THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THAT. WHILE AN AND I'D LIKE TO. IS REARED IN SCALE OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND SO I'M USING THAT IN SOME OF THE TERMS THAT. THAT THERE IS A SCALED WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. REALLY DIFFERENT BEHAVIOR WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE WHO MYSTERIES CUES AND YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEBODY ELSE WHO'S WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED SOMEBODY THESE ARE REALLY DIFFERENT SITUATIONS. MOST OF THE SITUATIONS THAT. I GET AS AN INVESTIGATOR. ARE NOT ON THAT LEVEL OF EGREGIOUS MIS I MEAN I AM. I HAVE CERTAINLY INVESTIGATED MANY OF THEM. BUT NOT FIFTY PERCENT MAY BE TEN PERCENT OF WHAT I INVESTIGATE IS AT THAT LEVEL. MOST OF THE COMPLAINTS THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE CONTENDING WITH. ARE NOT GOING TO BE AT THAT AT A SERIOUS LEVEL OF EGREGIOUS MIS. AND YOU KNOW PEOPLE ALSO TALK ABOUT WHAT ABOUT FALSE CLAIMS THERE ARE VERY FEW FALSE CLAIMS. BUT THERE ARE LOTS OF MISUNDERSTANDING. MISINTERPRETATIONS POOR MEMORIES EXAGGERATIONS TAKING SOMETHING OUT OF CONTEXT SO. SO WE'RE WE'RE SORT OF TALKING ABOUT THE EXCEPTIONAL CASE BUT YOU'RE MAKING POLICIES. FOR ALL OF THESE CASES WHICH ARE MORE TYPICALLY. GOING TO BE MORE GARDEN VARIETY AND SO IF YOU'RE INSTITUTING A DUE PROCESS HEARING DOES THAT MEAN EVERY CASE GETS A DUE PROCESS HEARING BY A PANEL. AND WHAT IS THE FALL OUT OF THAT BOTH FINANCIALLY AND IN THE WORKPLACE. I MEAN REALLY WORK COULD GRIND TO A HALT IF THAT WAS THE CASE AND. IT WOULD BECOME THE ONLY THING PEOPLE WERE THINKING ABOUT AND TALKING ABOUT AND AND YET THERE ARE CASES THAT MAYBE YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE. THAT KIND OF PROCESS. IS THERE A MINIMUM BAR FOR WHAT'S GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED. YOU KNOW I YOU I TRAIN PEOPLE YOU INVESTIGATE SOMETHING THAT IF. IF TRUE WOULD BE A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF YOUR RULES AND EXPECTATIONS AND STANDARDS. AND THEY ARE CONTESTED FAX IT MIGHT BE THE PEOPLE AGREE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED THEN YOU DON'T HAVE TO INVESTIGATE IT. BUT HOW SO HOW SERIOUS VIOLATION WITH SOMETHING HAVE TO BE. IF YOU LOOK AT THAT SCALE. EVEN THE FIRST SCALE OF. OF CONDUCT NON OFFENSIVE. SOME PEOPLE WOULD SAY. MY COWORKER TELLING ME YOU LOOK LOVELY IS OFFENSIVE AND THAT I CONSIDER THAT HARASSMENT I WANT TO INVESTIGATE IT. AND. THAT THAT WOULD COME UNDER THE SCALE OF A MINOR. ARE NOT OFFENSIVE COMMENT. WOULD YOU INVESTIGATED HOW DO YOU DETERMINE THAT. WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT'S GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED? AND. THERE WAS A DISCUSSION OF WHAT ONE OF THE HEARINGS ABOUT SCOPE THE SAYING THAT THE INVESTIGATOR. SHOULD BE ABLE TO ADD ANYTHING TO THE SCOPE AND MY PRACTICE THAT'S UP TO MY CLIENT. IF IT'S UP TO ME IS THAT LIKE THE FULL IMPLEMENT ACT OF NINETEEN. OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN FOR ME BECAUSE YOU KNOW THERE ARE LOTS OF THINGS GOING ON. YOU HAVE TO REALLY PUT A LOT OF TRUST IN THE INVESTIGATOR IF THEY'RE GOING TO DETERMINE IT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE CAN BE MISTRUST THAT. THINGS ARE GONNA COME UP THE NEW PLAYER IS NOT GOING TO DEAL WITH SO HOW CAN YOU HAVE. A PROCESS THAT PEOPLE WILL TRUST BUT THAT STILL GIVES YOU SOME CONTROL OF THAT. AND. ALL OF THIS IS IMPACTING PEOPLE AT WORK EVERY DAY. GOING THROUGH AN INVESTIGATION FOR THE COMPLAINT FOR THE RESPONDENT FOR ALL OF THE WITNESSES AND ALL THE PEOPLE ARE CALLED AS WITNESSES. IS ANXIETY PRODUCING IT'S TIME CONSUMING. IT CAN'T HAPPEN AS QUICKLY AS PEOPLE WANT AND SO ALL. ALL OF THIS IS DISRUPTIVE AND DIFFICULT TO YOU HAVE TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT WHEN IS IT WORTH. THAT DESTRUCTION AND ARE THERE OTHER WAYS FOR THIS PARTICULAR COMPLAINT. THAT WOULD BE A CREDIBLE WAY OF HANDLING IT. THERE'S A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY WHO GETS ACCESS TO INFORMATION. ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS ALWAYS WITNESSES WHO IN YOU YOU TALK TO WITNESSES WHO ARE WORRIED ABOUT RETALIATION SOMETIMES THEY'RE WORRIED THAT THE PERSON WHO'S ACCUSED IS GOING TO RETALIATE SOMETIMES THEY'RE WORRIED. THE PERSON WHO MADE THE ACCUSATION IS GONNA RETALIATE THESE ARE PEOPLE WHO KNOW EACH OTHER WELL. THEIR CAMPS AT WORK. AND. IF YOU'RE GOING TO BE REVEALING THE REPORT. I'M USED TO WRITING A VERY DETAILED REPORT BECAUSE I'M AN OUTSIDER I WANT YOU TO KNOW EVERYTHING I KNOW ABOUT THIS WORK ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE IF I DON'T TELL YOU. THEN NOBODY'S GONNA KNOW. BUT IF I DO THAT. EVEN IF I. IF I TRY TO KEEP PEOPLE ANONYMOUS WHICH SENT YOU KNOW SOMETIMES I WON'T HOWEVER YOU PRONOUNCE THAT WORD ANIMAL TO ANALYZE I CAN'T SAY. MAKING MAKING SOMETHING THERE'S A WORD FOR MAKING SOMETHING ANONYMOUS ANIMALIZE. ALONG THE LINE. THANK YOU. OKAY I LEARNED IT RELATIVELY RECENTLY MYSELF. AND UP BUT YET. IT'S SO OBVIOUS TO PEOPLE ARE IN THESE YOU KNOW THESE ARE THESE SMALL WORK ENVIRONMENT LIKE EACH. SENATOR ASSEMBLY PERSONS. HAS JUST BEEN A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WORKING FOR THEM AND SO. THERE'S NOT A HUGE UNIVERSE I MEAN IN MOST WORK ENVIRONMENTS THERE'S NOT A HUGE UNIVERSE AND SO. YOU MAY THINK THAT YOU'RE KEEPING SOMEBODY ANONYMOUS WHEN YOU'RE NOT. SO WIDE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION ON THE ONE HAND YOUR YOU KNOW THAT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE. LETTING PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU ARE TAKING THESE SERIOUSLY AND ON THE OTHER HAND THERE IS A FALL OUT ON PEOPLE AT WORK DAY TODAY. AS YOU GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS IT IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN HOW YOU'RE GOING TO HANDLE THE SITUATION WITH ANY THE ELECTED. AND EVERYBODY ELSE THAT THAT THAT IS A DIFFERENT ANIMAL I'VE DONE INVESTIGATIONS. INVOLVING ELECTED OFFICIALS. THAT THERE ARE LIMITATIONS ON OBVIOUSLY WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE THE SAME KIND OF LIMITS ON. WITH OTHER EMPLOYEES. AND. I. TREATING THEM DIFFERENTLY WOULD MAKE SENSE TO ME IN TERMS OF FASHIONING THESE SO THAT YOU BOTH HAVE. A DIFFERENT PROCESS ELECTED NON ELECTED AND A DIFFERENT PROCESS DEPENDING ON THE SEVERITY. OF THE ALLEGATION AND AND THE POSSIBLE CONSEQUENCE THAT IT COULD LEAD TO. I'M. JUST TO SORT OF TALK FOR A MINUTE ABOUT THE WHOLE. RIGHT AND WRONG IN A WINNER LOSER PARADIGM THAT WE GET INTO WITH THIS WHICH. YOU KNOW THERE ARE HARVEY WEINSTEIN'S AND RIGHT AND WRONG IS JUST ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THERE IS NO QUESTION. BUT AGAIN WHEN WE GET INVOLVED IN INVESTIGATING THESE SITUATIONS. IT IS NOT ALWAYS SO CLEAR. SURE THERE ARE SOMETIMES. BUT. AS THERE ARE ARE SERIOUS ABUSIVE SITUATIONS. AND YET THE MAJORITY. MIGHT BE PEOPLE WHO WERE CLOSE AT ONE TIME AND AREN'T CLOSE ANYMORE HAD AN UNDERSTANDING DON'T HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING. THAT HAVE VERY. ONGOING COMPLICATED RELATIONSHIPS THAT WE WALK INTO THE MIDDLE OF AND THEN TRY TO UNDERSTAND. AND SO AND I KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR NEXT ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY GETS LOST IN THIS IS. OTHER SOLUTIONS AND FOR THE WORKPLACE. CAN WE EVER USE MEDIATION IN SITUATIONS THAT ARE VERY SERIOUS CAN WE EVER. GET PEOPLE TALKING TO EACH OTHER BECAUSE. THIS KIND OF INVESTIGATION. IT WAS EITHER FOUNDED OR NOT FOUNDED AND THEN PEOPLE MOVE ON AND HAVE THEIR RIGHTS OR THEY THEY AREN'T HURT. DOESN'T REALLY SOLVE A LOT OF THE UNDERLYING ISSUES AND. BECAUSE YOU GET A PROCESS FOR THESE KINDS OF COMPLAINTS. YOU END UP GETTING COMPLAINTS THEY DON'T REALLY BELONG HERE BECAUSE PEOPLE DON'T FEEL HEARD ANYWHERE ELSE. AND SO THE SAME TIME. IF YOU CAN HAVE A PROCESS FOR PEOPLE TO AIR GRIEVANCES. AND HEAR EACH OTHER AND TAKE SOME OF THE PRESSURE OFF OF THIS SYSTEM. THAT WOULD BE A GOOD THING. YEAH. I AGREE ENTIRELY WITH THAT I JUST WANNA ADD. THERE'S SOMETHING TO IT WHICH IS FROM AN ENFORCEMENT PERSPECTIVE WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT AN EMPLOYER. AND TRYING TO DECIDE WHETHER THEY DOCTORED REASONABLY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S A RED FLAG FOR US ISIF THEY HAVEN'T ACTED DECISIVELY IN THOSE FEW SITUATIONS AS FEW COMPLAINTS WHEN IT IS CLEAR. RIGHT WHEN THERE'S AN ALLEGATION OF PHYSICAL ASSAULT FOR EXAMPLE AND SO BUNDLING THOSE. TEN PERCENT OF THE CASES. TOTALLY UNDERMINES FAITH THAT THERE CAN BE A MORE RESTORATIVE. A MORE NUANCED. APPROACH TO THE LESS SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO GET THE SERIOUS CASES RIGHT AND IF AN EMPLOYER CAN GET THE SERIOUS CASES RIGHT. AND THERE'S A LOT MORE. GOOD FAITH BROUGHT BY ALL PARTIES IN RESOLVING GUY COMPLAINS THAT. MAY OR MAY NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF A VIOLATION OF THE LAW OR THE POLICY BUT NONETHELESS ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS IN THE WORKPLACE. I'M. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ABOUT ZERO TOLERANCE IT'S I DON'T. I DON'T LIKE WHAT ARE CALLED ZERO TOLERANCE POLICIES UNLESS IT'S CLEAR THAT WHAT IT MEANS IS. THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE RESPONDED TO. IT'S TOO OFTEN UNDERSTOOD TO MEAN ANYBODY WHO CROSSES THIS LINE WILL BE TERMINATED AND AND. OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A PROBLEM. THE ASSEMBLY POLICY SAYS IT DOES HAVE A STRICTER STANDARD THAN THE LAW. AND IT USES THE TERM ZERO HOT TOLERANCE BUT THEN IT GOES ON TO DEFINE SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE MOST NARROW OF WAYS REPEATING THE LEGAL DEFINITION SO THAT THERE'S AN INTERNAL CONTRADICTION THERE. RIGHT NOW I'M WORKING WITH TWO DIFFERENT ORGANIZATIONS ONE OF THEM. HAS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY THAT YOU HAVE TO IT HAS TO BE FOR SEVERE PERVASIVE SO IT EXACTLY MIRRORS THE LAW. THE OTHER ONE HAS A SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY THAT DOESN'T EVEN SAY IT HAS TO BE ON WELCOME. IT'S JUST ANYTHING THAT'S UNPROFESSIONAL. AND YOU KNOW THE USER. I THINK THERE ARE PROBLEMS WITH BOTH OF THOSE. IN THE ON THE ONE HAND. PEOPLE MIGHT GET TERMINATED FIRST FOR SOMETHING QUOTE UNQUOTE UNPROFESSIONAL BECAUSE IT VIOLATES THE SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY. AND IF OU MAKE A FINDING THAT SOMETHING VIOLATES A CIGARETTE POLICY INFERENCES THIS WAS SERIOUS. AND YET IT WAS SIMPLY SOMETHING QUOTE ON QUOTE AND PROFESSIONAL. ON THE OTHER HAND YOU MAY GET SOMEBODY WHO DOES THINGS THAT WOULD CLEARLY VIOLATE YOUR EXPECTATIONS THAT WOULDN'T BE MADE A LEGAL DEFINITION. OF SEVERE PERVASIVE AND IT LOOKS LIKE UNDER YOUR POLICY YOU COULDN'T DO ANYTHING AND AND SO I WOULD. ENCOURAGE YOU TO CLARIFY. THOSE POLICIES. I ALREADY TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. THIS THE CONFIDENTIALITY ISSUE. IT IS GOING TO IMPACT. EVERYBODY INVOLVED. IT MAY ALSO IMPACT HOW THE REPORT IS WRITTEN. IF SOMEBODY'S GOING TO HAVE FULL ACCESS TO A REPORT. I MIGHT. THINK THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A REALLY EXPLOSIVE FACT FOR PEOPLE NOT BECAUSE IT MAKES SOMEBODY MORE OR LESS CLINICAL GUILTY BUT BECAUSE. IT WOULD BE HIGHLY EMBARRASSING TO SOMEBODY WHO ISN'T EVEN DIRECTLY INVOLVED AND DOESN'T NEED TO BE HIGHLY EMBARRASSED. AND SO I. THE FEAR IS THAT OF CENSORING. IF YOU HAVE SUCH WIDE ACCESS TO THE REPORT. I KNOW THERE WAS A THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSES AND I UNDERSTAND THE PUBLIC POLICY ISSUE. I ALSO KNOW AS AN ATTORNEY. THEN AGAIN YOU GET A LOT OF CASES THAT ARE NOT. VERY SERIOUS AND THAT COULD SETTLE WITH A CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE AND EVEN PLAINTIFF'S ATTORNEY WOULD LIKE IT TO SETTLE. FOR THE PLAINTIFF WOULD LIKE TO SETTLE SO IF YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONFIDENTIALITY CLAUSE. THOSE CASES MAY LITIGATE. THAT MAY NOT BE A GOOD THING I MEAN THAT'S AGAIN SORT OF THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES IF YOU HAVE. TARGETS OF HARASSMENT WHO WERE TOLD. YES WE CAN DO SOMETHING FOR YOU WE CAN RESOLVE YOUR CASE BUT. ONLY IF WE DO KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL OTHERWISE THIS IS GOING TO TRIAL. MIGHT NOT ALWAYS BE THE BEST OPTION. RIGHT. I JUST WANT TO ADD A NOTE OF CAUTION THERE THAT END UP IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH ANYTHING THAT WE SIGN IS DEFINITION ONLY. NOT CONFIDENTIAL SO ANY STATE EMPLOYER. I. STATE DEPARTMENT THAT REACHES A ETTLEMENT THAT SETTLEMENT UNDER THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT REQUEST AS INCOMPETENCE YET CONFIDENTIAL. BASED ON THAT EMPIRICAL REALITY I HAVE. I HAVE SOME DOUBTS ABOUT HOW MUCH CONFIDENTIALITY MATTERS. I THINK THE CASE IS SETTLED OR THEY DON'T. EYES CERTAINLY AGREED THAT IT CAN BE EASIER TO SETTLE A CASE WITH CONFIDENTIALITY OF ALL THE PARTIES AGREE BUT HAVING THAT OPTION OFF THE TABLE. HAS NOT BEEN MY EXPERIENCE MATED. IMPOSSIBLE TO SETTLE CASES EVEN EVEN MORE MINOR CASES WELL THAT'S THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW AND I DON'T MIND BEING WRONG ABOUT THAT. THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE WHEN. MOSTLY WHEN THIS IS OUTSOURCES OUTSOURCED TO ATTORNEYS AND WITH IT I HAVE A SLIGHT ABOUT THAT LATER BUT. MOSTLY IT'S DONE UNDER THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE I KNOW AGAIN THAT THERE ARE THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR BUT THAT MEANS YOU COULD BE HIDING INFORMATION IT SHOULD BE DONE. AS A NON PRIVILEGED INVESTIGATION. AND IN FACT IF IT'S USED AS A DEFENSE THEN THE ENTITY HAS TO WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE. THE THINGS TO THINK ABOUT IS THAT. AS AN INVESTIGATOR I WANT YOU TO GIVE ME VERY WIDE INFORMATION I WANT YOU TO OPEN UP EVERYTHING TO ME. AND. MY CLIENTS ARE WILLING TO DO THAT WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT. IT'S A PRIVILEGE. I MAY FIND SOMETHING OUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE TO DO WITH CURRENT COMPLAINT. AND MOVE THAT MAYBE SOMETHING THEN THAT EVEN IF SOMETHING WENT TO TRIAL IT COULD BE KEPT AS. UNDER THE PRIVILEGE. BECAUSE IT WAS A PRIVILEGE INVESTIGATION IF IT'S NOT DONE UNDER THE PRIVILEGE MIGHT IT PERHAPS IS EXPOSING THAT INFORMATION. TO THE PUBLIC SCRUTINY. YOU MIGHT FIND. THAT. ENTITIES GENERALLY IF THEY'RE NOT DOING THIS UNDER THE ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. MAY NOT BE AS GENEROUS WITH THE INFORMATION THAT. WE AS INVESTIGATORS HOPE THEM TO BE. AND SO AGAIN THAT MIGHT BE AN UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE THAT. COULD BE PROBLEMATIC TO REALLY GETTING THE INFORMATION TO MAKE THE RIGHT FIND. I THINK WE I TALKED ABOUT SCOPE ALREADY I DON'T KNOW. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT YOU SHOULDN'T BE LIMITING. THE COMPLAINTS TO ONE YEAR WHICH I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH BUT THEN I WOULD ALSO BE CAREFUL ABOUT SAYING THAT. EVERYTHING IS GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED REGARDLESS OF. WHEN THE COMPLAINT EMANATED AGAIN I THINK YOU NEED TO LOOK AT THE SERIOUSNESS. IF IF WE ASSUME THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A SERIOUS SEXUAL ASSAULT I. TOTALLY AGREE. BUT YOU'RE GOING TO GET A LOT OF COMPLAINTS THAT ARE NOT THAT SERIOUS. AND IF YOU'RE GONNA GO BACK TEN TWENTY YEARS. IN A COMPLAINT THAT INVOLVES PERHAPS PEOPLE WHO WEREN'T EVEN HERE OR SOME WITNESSES WHO ARE HERE. INTERPRETATION OF EVENTS THAT ARE AMBIGUOUS IT'S GOING TO BE. MORE DIFFICULT TO MAKE A FINDING AND. IT MAY NOT ALWAYS BE WORTH IT FOR YOU TO DO THAT SO. YOU CAN I THINK HAVE TO EXERCISE SOME DISCRETION. WHEN DETERMINING HOW WHETHER TO GO FURTHER BACK IN A PARTICULAR CASE CERTAINLY A YEAR IS VERY SHORT. PERIOD OF TIME THOUGH AND AND TWO SHORT I THINK. THE AND NOT THE ISSUE THE ANONYMOUS COMPLAINTS I THINK THAT WHAT'S TRICKY HERE IS IS WHAT KEVIN WAS TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. IT'S NOT THE COMPLAINT. WHERE YOU DON'T KNOW WHO'S COMPLAINING BECAUSE THEN YOU JUST GO FORWARD? IT'S THE COMPLAINT WHERE YOU DO KNOW WHO'S COMPLAINING BUT THEY DON'T WANT ANYBODY ELSE TO KNOW AND YOU HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO GO FORWARD. AND I THINK WHAT YOU NEED THERE IS CLARITY IN YOUR POLICIES THAT. I KNOW YOU HAVE A WE'VE THAT PEOPLE CAN GO TO AND KEP IT CONFIDENTIAL THAT IF YOU WANT TO KEEP THIS CONFIDENTIAL THAT'S YOUR ROUTE. IF YOU GO A DIFFERENT ROUTE WE CAN'T KEEP IT CONFIDENTIAL. AND EXPLAIN WHY AND USUALLY THAT PERSON EVENTUALLY WHAT WILL COME AROUND BUT BUT THAT'S REALLY THE THE TRICKY ISSUE I THINK. I KNOW HE IS ONE OF YOUR BIG DECISION POINTS IS WHO IS GOING TO DO THESE INVESTIGATIONS. AND. SHOULD YOU HAVE AN OUTSIDE BODY. ON. ULTIMATELY YOU ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR EVER A HARASSMENT FREE WORKPLACE FOR PREVENTING HARASSMENT FOR RESPONDING TO HARASSMENT. AND. QUERY WHETHER YOU CAN OUTSOURCE THAT AND IF SO WHO YOU WOULD OUTSOURCE THAT. TO. THERE HASN'T BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION OF THIS BUT. IN UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE. BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE PRIVATE INVESTIGATORS ACT. MANDATES THAT AN OUTSIDER WHO DOES INVESTIGATION HAS TO EITHER BE A LICENSED PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR. OR AN ATTORNEY ACTING IN HIS OR HER CAPACITY AS AN ATTORNEY SO ANYBODY CAN DO IT INTERNALLY. AND HOPEFULLY THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE WELL TRAINED BECAUSE THAT'S REALLY THE BIGGEST ISSUE FOR THE INTERNAL FOLKS. IF YOU'RE GONNA USE AN EXTERNAL THEN. YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO EITHER USE A LICENSED PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR OF WHOM THERE ARE SOME WHO ARE VERY QUALIFIED TO DO THIS THE CURRENT PRESIDENT OF EIGHT OF THE YCJA. LICENSED PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR NON ATTORNEY. BUT. THERE IS A SMALLER POOL. OR MOSTLY YOU'RE GOING TO BE USING ATTORNEYS WHO SHOULD HAVE AN ATTORNEY CLIENT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU THAT DOESN'T MEAN IT HAS TO BE PRIVILEGED BECAUSE YOU CAN WAIVE THE PRIVILEGE. BUT THERE STILL HAS TO BE AN ATTORNEY CLIENT. RELATIONSHIP. NOW. I DON'T KNOW ABOUT SETTING UP A COMMISSION I'M NOT AN EXPERT ON THAT SO YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S INTRIGUING. BUT AGAIN I WOULD. IT STILL SEEMS TO ME THAT NINETY PERCENT OF YOUR COMPLAINTS ARE GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED BY. EITHER AN INTERNAL PERSON OR AN EXTERNAL PERSON NOT A. NOT A COMMISSION NOT A OR A. A WHOLE JUDICATA BODY. IF YOU SET THAT UP FOR EVERY COMPLAINT THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW QUITE AN EXPENSIVE AND CUMBERSOME PROCESS. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A. I'M NEUTRAL BODY THAT COULD DO THESE WE DON'T REALLY HAVE THAT RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE TALK ABOUT BUYS BECAUSE THE EMPLOYER PAYS AND THAT THAT'S A SYSTEM IT'S YOUR RESPONSIBILITY SO YOU DO PAY. IT'S JUST SORT OF WHAT WE'VE GOT. AND YOU KNOW SOME IDEAS ABOUT MESSAGING. THAT YOU CAN DO. IN ORDER TO FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW AN INSTITUTION CAN INVESTIGATE ITSELF AND BE IMPARTIAL OKAY OKAY. I CAN JUST YOU WANT ME TO JUST WE CAN GO ON TO QUESTIONS OKAY. ONE TO FINISH THE SLIDES ARM I THINK THIS MIGHT BE THE LAST ONE SO JUST YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE TRY TO TRAIN INVESTIGATORS IN IS. THERE AREN'T BAD FACTS THEY'RE JUST FAX AND THAT THAT INVESTIGATORS ARE DOING FACT FINDING. AND. THAT YOU WANT PEOPLE WITH A LOT OF AUTHORITY. OR WHO AND WHO ARE ANSWERING TO BE WITH A LOT OF AUTHORITY BECAUSE THE LESS AUTHORITY YOU HAVE THE MORE YOU'RE GOING TO FEEL BEHOLDEN TO SOMEBODY'S POINT OF VIEW. AND BE IMPACTED BY THAT IN WAYS THAT MAYBE THE INVESTIGATOR ISN'T EVEN AWARE. OKAY SO. THANK YOU THAT WAS REALLY REALLY HAVE VERY LITTLE A LIMITED IF FOR US AND I THINK A LOT OF US HAVE BEEN WONDERING KIND OF. HOW OUR INVESTIGATIONS DYNAMITED THE BEST PRACTICES AND THAT ENTERED A LOT AND I I WANT TO CLARIFY THAT WHEN I WAS SPEAKING EARLIER ABOUT? YOU KNOW SORT OF AN OUTSIDE BODY I WAS THINKING MORE ABOUT THE ACCOUNTABILITY PORTION AND WHAT HAPPENS AFTER INVESTIGATIONS RETURNED. BECAUSE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT. WE CAN AND AND MOST PROBABLY DO VERY EFFECTIVE INVESTIGATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS AT THIS POINT. BUT I THINK IT'S THE NEXT STEP IN WHEN THAT INVESTIGATION COMES BACK AND WE DO THE FACTUAL TYPE OF. DOMESTICATION WHERE THEY DON'T COME BACK AND SAY IT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT THEY COME BACK AND THEY SAY WE THINK THIS EVENT HAPPENED IN THAT ABOUT HAPPENS. WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT NAPS I THINK WHEN IT COMES TO MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE? SOMETHING THAT WE'RE STILL. UNDER DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT WHAT HAPPENS AFTER THAT I AND THAT'S WHERE IT'S A LOT LESS CLEAR TO ME ANYWAY AND WHERE I THINK WE REALLY WERE GOING TO NEED TO BE DOING QUITE A LOT OF DISCUSSION I THINK WITH EMPLOYEES THAT'S. A LOT EASIER BUT WITH ELECTED OFFICIALS SAID IT IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S MORE DIFFICULT I HAVE A QUESTION BEFORE I MOVE ON TO THE PANEL UP HERE. OUT YOU KNOW WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT RETALIATION AGAINST WITNESSES RETALIATION AGAINST PEOPLE BRINGING CLAIMS WONDER IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENT ABOUT RETALIATION TOWARDS PEOPLE THAT ARE ACCUSED TOUR THEN. OF THE INVESTIGATION COMES BACK AND IT'S EITHER NOT DETERMINATIVE OR UNSUBSTANTIATED AND HOW WE. OR SHOULD WE BE WORRIED ABOUT PROTECTING THOSE INDIVIDUALS ESPECIALLY IF THE INVESTIGATION HAS BECOME PUBLIC. I THINK YOU DO I MEAN I THINK EVERYBODY INVOLVED HAS THE SAME RIGHTS COMPLAINT IS NOT SUBSTANTIATED YOU NEED TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THAT CONVERSATION. AND TELL PEOPLE THAT TELL THE PEOPLE INVOLVED THAT IT'S NOT SUBSTANTIATED AND I THINK. TO ONE OF THE. THINGS THAT I'VE SEEN HAPPEN IS THAT PEOPLE KNOW THAT THERE'S AN INVESTIGATION AND THEN THEY NEVER KNOW WHAT HAPPENED IN THAT LEAVES THIS KIND OF CLOUD SUSPICION OVER THE ENTIRE THING AND YOU CAN. PLAY A ROLE IN REMOVING THAT CLOUD. BY JUST TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THE RESULT IS. I SHOULD MENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR. I WAS STRUCK BY YOUR. FLY THE TALK REALLY ABOUT THE NINETY TEN KIND OF RULE. AND THAT. TO QUOTE YOU SLIDE VERY VERY FEW FALSE CLAIMS ALL YOU'LL HEAR EMPLOYERS WE HERE IN THIS BUILDING THE NOTION THAT. PEOPLE WILL DEFAULT TO A CLAIM OF WORKPLACE HARASSMENT OR SEXUAL HARASSMENT ON BECAUSE THEY'RE AND THEY'RE RIGHT A DISGRUNTLED EMPLOYEE OR ON A MEMBER HAS BEEN ATTEMPTING TO. ENGAGING CORRECTIVE ACTION AND MOVE ABOUT AND THEN THAT'S WHEN EMPLOYEE WILL YOU KNOW SO THAT'S WHAT YOU HEAR A LOT KIND OF. NOT JUST HERE BUT IN IN THE WORK. THE EMPLOYER SIDE OF THINGS CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE ABOUT THAT BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE'RE DEALING WITH PERCEPTIONS. PERCEPTIONS OF VICTIMS PERCEPTIONS OF THE PERPETRATORS AND HOW WE DIDN'T. GET PAST THOSE PERCEPTIONS TO SOME OF THOSE THE BRASS TACKS THE REALITIES OF WHAT YOU'VE EXPERIENCED WITH YEARS OF EXPERIENCE AND YOUR BELT INVESTIGATING THESE KINDS OF CLAIMS. WELL. I THINK THAT WHAT'S RARE IS SOMEBODY MAKING SOMETHING UP. OUT OF WHOLE CLOTH. NO BUT SOMEBODY TAKING SOMETHING OUT OF CONTEXT BECAUSE THEY'RE ANGRY WITH SOMEBODY. OR EXAGGERATING IT OR COMPLAINING ABOUT SOMETHING THAT MAYBE THEY. DIDN'T REALLY CARE ABOUT AT THE TIME. YOU KNOW WHAT IT MEAN THERE'S ALL SORTS OF NUANCES TO THEM. AND SO IT'S MORE UNDERSTANDING. WHAT MAKES SOMEBODY COMPLAIN WHEN THEY DO IS THERE A MOTIVE OTHER THAN THEY WERE OFFENDED? AND THEN THE FACT THAT THERE MAY BE A MOTIVE DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT DIDN'T HAPPEN BUT IT MAY COLOR HOW SERIOUS IT WAS OR HOW OR WHAT THE INITIAL REACTION WAS. I'LL JUST ADD THAT THE. THE BEST SOCIAL SCIENCE THAT I'VE SEEN SUGGESTS THAT SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING. FOR EXAMPLE ASSAULT. THOSE ARE ALMOST ALWAYS TRUE. A VANISHINGLY SMALL PERCENTAGE OF THOSE ALLEGATIONS ARE FALSE THERE ARE SOME AND WE HAVE TO CATCH THEM BT SOMETHING LIKE NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THOSE ARE TRUE. WITH THAT SAID IT DF PH WE SEE A HUGE NUMBER OF COMPLAINTS THAT EVEN IF TRUE WOULD NOT VIOLATE. THE LAW AND I THINK THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE I'M PEOPLE HAVE VERY FEW AVENUES TO EXPRESS. THINGS THAT ARE GOING WRONG. THEY KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE AVENUE TO DO IT AND THEY KNOW THAT IF THEY SAY THE WORDS DISCRIMINATION OR HARASSMENT THAT IT WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND SO IT IS. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT'S EMPLOYERS WE ALL HAVE TO BE ALERT TO AND SO IT'S NOT WRONG THAT PEOPLE BRING ALL KINDS OF ALLEGATIONS FORWARD THAT AREN'T ULTIMATELY HARASSMENT OR DISCRIMINATION. BUT IT'S ALSO NOT WRONG THAT WHEN THERE ARE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS THAT BY AND LARGE THEY ARE TRUE. THANK YOU FOR THAT IS MY LAST QUESTION AT THE COMMENT ON MY I APPRECIATE. THIS NOTION OF BECAUSE I THINK IT'S TYPICAL FACTION FACTOR FASHION SOMETHING HAPPEN GIVEN THE JERK AND WE. ALL RUN TO THE THIS SITE KIND OF OF THE ROOM AND SO WE'RE GOING TO. HAVE OUTSIDE INVESTIGATORS FOR EVERY CLAIM IN AND IN WHAT YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT THEIR CANDY KIND OF A BIFURCATED SYSTEM LORDS SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS BINGO EXTERNAL. BECAUSE THE REALITY IS WHAT WHAT NO ONE HAS REALLY TALKED ABOUT IN ALL THESE HEARINGS WHATEVER WE DO. IS AT PUBLIC EXPENSE. WHAT EVER INFRASTRUCTURE WE BUILD IS AT PUBLIC EXPENSE BECAUSE WE'RE A PUBLIC ENTITY SO I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY ALSO TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT? AND MAKE SURE THAT E ARE RESERVING THE MORE EXPENSIVE IF YOU WILL STRUCTURE OF THE EXTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS BY THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE UNDER UNDER THE LAW. ONLY. THOSE ELIGIBLE TO CONDUCT THEM BUT THEY ARE RESERVED FOR THE SERIOUS ALLEGATIONS THAT IT IS IS DEEMED APPROPRIATE FOR AN EXTERNAL INVESTIGATOR AND THAT AND THAT WE MAKE SURE OUR INTERNAL SYSTEM. IS ROLLED BUS ON THE INVESTIGATORS ARE WELL TRAINED AND THAT WE HAVE THE LOOP BACK TO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE TELL PEOPLE THE OUTCOME OF THOSE INVESTIGATIONS WE'VE GOT TO BE MINDFUL OF ALL THAT. I'M I DON'T WANNA VOLUNTEER FOR EXTRA WORK BUT I DO WANT TO GO BACK TO. SOME TO ME MENTIONED ABOUT MEDIATION. WHEN THERE ARE ALLEGATIONS OF. WRONGDOING THAT AREN'T VIOLATIONS OF LAW OR EVEN NECESSARILY A POLICY. MEDIATION CAN BE VERY EFFECTIVE WE HAD DF EACH HAVE A TEAM OF MEDIATORS AND UPON THE INVITATION OF AN EMPLOYER EVEN IF THERE'S NO COMPLAINT WE CAN ACTUALLY GO IN AND WE DO. I'M AND TRY AND RESOLVE THE DISPUTE AND SO I JUST WANT TO. PUT THAT OUT THERE INTO THE WORLD AND FOR YOU ALL IN PARTICULAR THAT THAT IS. THAT'S A RESOURCE THAT THE STATE ALREADY HOUSE. AND WHAT THAT APPLY IN THIS SCENARIO WHEN YOU HAVE A A NON EMPLOYEE EITHER A VOLUNTEER AN INTERN. I'M A MEMBER OF THE EXTERNAL COMMUNITY THAT THAT THE NATURE OF THEIR WORK BRINGS THEM. INTO THESE HALLOWED HALLS AND IN DEALING WITH BOTH LEGISLATE TOWARDS AND STAFF. VOLUNTEERS INTERNS ARE EXPLICITLY PROTECTED FROM SEXUALABOUT MEMBERS OF THE THIRD HOUSE WHO BY NATURE OF THEIR WORK ENGAGE WITH US ON A DAILY BASIS YET SO THE IT INSTITUTIONALLY FROM A LIABILITY PERSPECTIVE THE INSTITUTION HAS A POTENTIAL LIABILITY OF SOMEONE WHO WORKS HERE EXPERIENCES HARASSMENT AT THE HANDS. OF SOMEBODY ELSE AND YOU KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT ABOUT SO IF THERE'S SOMEBODY HAS A PROBLEM A REPEAT PLAYER. WHO'S CONDUCTING HARASSING ACTIVITY THEN YEAH. INSTITUTIONALLY THERE IS POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING LAW IF YOU'VE GOT. SOMEBODY HIT SO. BOTTOM LINE I WOULD SAY YES IN THOSE SITUATIONS I WOULD TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY AND I WOULD TRY TO FIGURE OUT WAYS TO RESOLVE. THANK YOU. TO PIGGY BACK BESIDES RESERVING OUTSIDE INVESTIGATIONS FOR MORE SERIOUS. ACCUSATIONS THE SOMETHING ELSE THAT ONE OF YOU SAID THAT I THOUGHT WAS VERY INTERESTING WAS THAT THE INVESTIGATION THE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD NEVER BE SUBORDINATE. TO THE PERSON OR THE BODY THAT THEY'RE INVESTIGATING IS ANOTHER REALLY GOOD WAY OF THINKING ABOUT IT BECAUSE OF THAT A PERCEPTION OF BIAS SO THAT'S ANOTHER LANDS THAT WE CAN. DECIDE TO USE TO DECIDE WHAT WE SENT OUT FROM THAT INVESTIGATION AND WHAT WE DO INTERNALLY. AND THIS IS. YOU'RE THE FIRST PANEL SO FAR THAT'S REALLY MADE A VERY STRONG CASE FOR HAVING AN INTERNAL WAY OR A PROCESS TO HELP RESOLVE. JUST YOUR YOUR AVERAGE WORKPLACE. CONFLICT TO THAT'S MUCH MORE STRUCTURED AND MORE FORMAL THAN MAYBE. MAYBE WHAT WE HAVE I MEAN IF WE HAVE A WE CERTAINLY HAVEN'T HAD IT PRESENTED TO US IN ANY OF THIS AS A WAY TO HELP. ACTORS THAT PRESSURE VALVE BEFORE THINGS ESCALATE. TO LEGAL CLAIMS. AND I I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I WOULD LIKE TO CERTAINLY ASK STAFF TO. YOU KNOW TO. LOOK INTO AND AND AND YOU KNOW BRING BACK TO US I'M SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. MS WALDRON. THE DEATH OF. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. WE TOUCHED A LITTLE BIT ON. THE VICTIM. WHO IS KINDA LEFT IN THE DARK AND YOU KNOW THE HOPE IS THAT THEY WOULD GET SOME INFORMATION ON THE RESOLUTION? ESPECIALLY IF IT WAS A SUBSTANTIATED. RESULT. BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE SEEN HERE THAT JUST MADE IT SO MUCH MORE. YOU KNOW EGREGIOUS IS THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW VICTIMS WERE COMPLETELY LEFT IN THE DARK. IT AS THE WHOLE PROCESS WENT THROUGH NOT EVEN KNOWING IF ANYONE WAS LOOKING AT IT NOT GETTING ANY UPDATES. FROM YOU KNOW HOW MUCH CAN THE VICTIM NALLE I MEAN THERE IT TAKES A LOT TO COME FORTH IT TAKES A LOT. YOU KNOW THEY REALLY STEP OUT AND FEEL LIKE ALL MY GOSH YOU KNOW THIS IS COULD BE MY CAREER. BUT THE CONDITIONS THAT THE WORK AND THERE IS GET TO BE SO BAD THAT THEY REALLY CAN'T. YOU KNOW COME TO WORK ANYMORE SO. HOW DO WE BALANCE YOU KNOW? WHAT THE VICTIM CAN KNOW BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'VE SEEN IS SOMETIMES THEY'RE MOVED AROUND OR THIS WHOLE PROCESS COMES TO WHATEVER THE ENDING IS NO ONE KNOWS BUT THAT? SO COLD PERPETRATOR IS STILL THERE. AND NO ONE KNOWS THAT THEY PAY A IT GET PAM OFF TO THE YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED. I'M. AND THEN. THE NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. SEATS OPEN UP. MEMBERS COME AND GO YOU KNOW WE HAD. TERM LIMITS BEFORE WE HAVE A LONGER TERMS NOW BUT WE STILL HAVE TURNOVER. SO THE NEW MEMBER COMES IN THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT MAYBE THIS PARTICULAR CIEF OF STAFF OR LEDGER DIRECTOR. WAS INVOLVED IN THE HARASSMENT CLAIM. THAT WHO KNOWS MAYBE WAS SUBSTANTIATED NO ONE'S SOUL KEPT UNDER THE DARK SOMETHING YOU CONTINUE THAT CYCLE. YEAH I KNOW I I I BELIEVE IN TRANSPARENCY FOR THE PERSON WHO BROUGHT THE COMPLAINT AND THE PERSON THE COMPLAINT WAS BROUGHT AGAINST THAT. IT TAKES MUCH LONGER THAN YOU WOULD LIKE IT TO AND YOU NEED TO BE IN TOUCH WITH THEM AND LET THEM KNOW YOU KNOW. HERE'S WHERE IT IS HERE'S WHY IT TOOK LONGER THAN I THOUGHT. IF PEOPLE ARE MOVED THEN THEY SHOULD BE UNDERSTANDING WHY THAT IS AND AND THEY CERTAINLY SHOULDN'T. I'M KIND OF BASIC SEXUAL HARASSMENT LAW THAT YOU SHOULDN'T BE MOVING THE. THE VICTIM. IT BE IF YOU HAVE TO MOVE SOMEBODY I REALIZE SOMETIMES THAT MAY NOT BE POSSIBLE IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A LEGISLATOR BUT. TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN YOU WANT TO TRY TO PROTECT THEM. I'M I WOULD SAY THE. ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES IS WHEN SOMEBODY I I WOULD JUST WANNA START WITH THE MOMENT THAT SOMEBODY COMES FORWARD WITH AN ALLEGATION ONE OF THE MOST COMMON MISTAKES WE SEE IS THAT THE PERSON RECEIVING THAT ALLEGATION WHETHER IT'S AN HR OFFICIAL. OR A BOSS OR WHOEVER THE RESPONSES OWN NOW. THAT SINCE IMMEDIATELY THE WRONG MESSAGE SO IT JUST IN TERMS OF TRAINING TO STOP FOR ACCEPTING COMPLAINTS THEY THANK YOU I'M SO GLAD YOU BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. I'M NOW YOU MAY NEED TO PAUSE AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT IT IS SERIOUS ENOUGH THAT YOU'RE EVEN GOING TO INVESTIGATE AND SO YOU CAN SAY. I NEED TO CONSULT WITH WHOEVER IS MAKING THIS DECISION AND WILL BE IN TOUCH WITH YOU TOMORROW OR BY FRIDAY OR WHENEVER IT IS DEPENDING OBVIOUSLY ON THE THING. IF THE DECISION IS TO MOVE FORWARD WITH AN INVESTIGATION THERE'S NO REASON NOT TO TELL. THE PERSON COMPLAINING THAT WE ARE MOVING FORWARD IN DESICCATION YOU WILL BE CONTACTED BY THE INVESTIGATOR. WHETHER IT'S OUTSIDE OR INSIDE AND THEN THE OUTSIDE OR INSIDE INVESTIGATOR SHOULD BE CONTACTING THAT PERSON. RIGHT AWAY SO THEN THEY KNOW WHAT'S GOING ON IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS AS AMY SAID I THINK IT'S FAIR TO TELL THEM. WE CAN'T MOVE FORWARD FOR A LITTLE BIT OF TIME BECAUSE OF PEOPLE'S SCHEDULES FOR. WHATEVER. I'M IF THEY COME IF THE ALLEGATIONS SUBSTANTIATED. WHO REALLY IT SHOULD BE GOING IN PEOPLE'S PERSONAL FILES AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT RULES? WHAT SPECIFIC RULES GOVERN THIS WORKPLACE BUT ANYWHERE ELSE I WOULD EXPECT THAT IF AN ALLEGATION OF THAT KINDA SUBSTANTIATED THAT THERE IS A RECORD OF IT? ON THAT SOMEONE WHO'S WORKING WITH THEM IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE ABLE TO SAY. NOW THEY'RE ALWAYS SETTLEMENTS WHERE PART OF THE SETTLEMENT IS THE AGREEMENT OUGHT TO FIT ANYTHING AND THE RECORD AND THAT'S JUST KIND OF A. CASE BY CASE SCENARIO AND THAT'S NO DIFFERENT HERE THAN IN ANY OTHER. EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT. AS FAR AS YOU KNOW WE'VE HAD THE ISSUE OF LEAKING DURING AN INVESTIGATION AND THEN OF COURSE IN OUR LINE OF WORK. IT'S IN THE PRESS. WHICH YOU KNOW THEY SHOULDN'T BE BREACHES OF PRIVACY BUT WHAT STEPS CAN BE TAKEN. TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY REPORTED COMPLAINT ON HIS HANDLE SECURELY AND APPROPRIATELY. YOU KNOW AND IF PEOPLE WITNESSES ARE BEING QUESTIONED. FROM. ARE THEY BOUND TO NOT TO DISCUSS THE QUESTIONING. DUE TO LEGAL REASONS YOU KNOW HOW WOULD THIS EVEN BE DON. WELL IT DEPENDS I EAN THERE IS. THERE IS SOME. LAW THAT. YOU CAN'T TELL PEOPLE NOT TO DISCUSS THINGS UNLESS THEY ARE EITHER MANAGEMENT. EMPLOYEE OR YOU GO THROUGH A PROCESS OF DETERMINING THAT IT WOULD OUT THERE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THE GENERAL RULE OF. THUMB THAT EMPLOYEES HAVE A RIGHT TO DISCUSS THEIR WORKING CONDITIONS AND THAT. AN INVESTIGATION AND A COMPLAINT AS PART OF THAT. SO YOU CAN IN SOME CASES AS PEOPLE NOT TO DISCUSS IT CERTAINLY CAN ASK ANYBODY IN MANAGEMENT NOT TO. THE REALITY IS THAT PEOPLE DO. THAT THIS IS IT IMPACTING THEIR LIVES IN A VERY BIG WAY AND IT'S. IT'S OFTEN JUST TOO DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO NOT TALK AND. THEN YOU HAVE TO MANAGE IT I I WISH THAT. THERE WAS A WAY TO MANAGE IT. THAT HAD MORE TRANSPARENCY BUT THERE ARE PRIVACY RIGHTS AND SO THEN YOU'RE OFF AND STUFF KNOWING SOMETHING THAT MIGHT MAKE THE SITUATION BETTER AND YET HAVING TO PROTECT SOMEBODY'S PRIVACY AND NOT REVEALING THAT. WHICH WHICH IS A REALLY DIFFICULT SITUATION TO BE IN. MY LAST QUESTION. THE. ISN'T INVESTIGATOR. TOM HOW DO THEY ASSESS THEMSELVES FOR BIAS. YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE RECOMMENDATIONS ON HOW TO CONDUCT THE ASSESSMENTS. WELL THE FIRST PART OF THE TRAINING THAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE AN INSTITUTE TO TRAIN PEOPLE AT THE SENSATION WORKPLACE INVESTIGATORS IS BIAS. AND BIAS. NOT JUST IN TERMS OF PEOPLE MAY HAVE A BIAS AGAINST A CERTAIN GROUP I MEAN WE THINK ABOUT THAT KIND OF BIAS BUT WERE ALL IMPACTED BY OTHER PEOPLE'S OPINIONS. I ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT MY CLIENT THINGS BECAUSE THEY ARE SUBCONSCIOUSLY TRYING TO BIAS ME FROM THE BEGINNING SO THAT I WILL AGREE WITH THEIR POINT OF VIEW. AND SO WHAT I'VE LEARNED TO DO IS TO SAY I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU THINK. I MIGHT AGREE WITH IT. BUT IF BUT IF YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HAPPY IF I DON'T AGREE THEY DON'T HIRE ME BECAUSE I MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH IT. AND SO I TRY TO PUT IT ON THE TABLE. AND THAT FREE IT MAKES ME FEEL FREER TO JUST MAKE A FINDING THAT IS THE OPPOSITE OF WHAT MY CLIENT. THINGS WOULD BE THE RIGHT FINDING AND. YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO KEEP TALKING ABOUT IT YOU HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE. CHECK YOUR WORK AND. NOT JUST DO THINGS IN A VACUUM I HAVE SOMEBODY ELSE IN MY OFFICE YOU KNOW AT LEAST TWO PEOPLE ARE READING EVERY REPORTS SO THAT. WAIT A MINUTE THERE'S A FACT THERE THAT YOU DIDN'T REALLY CONSIDERING. THAT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT WORK AND YOU CAN'T JUST GO WITH YOUR GUT YOU'VE GOT A. REASON THINGS OUT AND THAT THAT MEANS WELL TRAINED INVESTIGATORS. THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD TO THAT IS THAT THE CLEAREST. WHO THIS SITUATION AT LEAST A PERCEPTION OF BIAS IS IF THE PERSON CONDUCTING THE INVESTIGATION IS KNOWN TO BE FRIENDS? WITH THE PEOPLE INVOLVED ONE OF THE OTHER. AND IN MOST WORKPLACES MANY PEOPLE DO YOU KNOW THAT. I AM AND THAT'S AN EASY ONE EFFECTS YOU JUST DON'T LET THEM INVESTIGATE. THE OEO OFFICE OR WHOEVER IT IS IS JUST REMOVED FROM THAT. CASE. YEAH. APOLOGISTS SECTION A QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO FOR THE COMMITTEE ELABORATE ON WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT HAVING SOME MORE PEOPLE CAN RELIEVE THEIR PRESSURE OR PRESSURE VALVE OR WHAT NOT. I I KNOW ALL MY EXPERIENCE COMES OUT THE LABOR MOVEMENT BUT THAT'S WHAT I DID FOR TWENTY YEARS AND I WAS A MEMBER FOR THIRTY YEARS. BUT ALL OF OUR WORK PLACES THAT HAD STEWARDS AND THAT WAS LIKE THE FRONTLINE OF DEFENSE THOSE WERE THE WORK PLACES WE HAD THE FEWEST. COMPLAINTS OR GRIEVANCES BECAUSE THE WORKER AT THE MEMBER HAD SOMEONE THEY CAN GO TO THE STEWARD WAS TRAINED TO SAY IS IT A GRIPE OR GRIEVANCE BUT THE FOR THE PERSON FOR FELT HEARD WHICH IS WHAT MOST PEOPLE WANT IS THEY WANT TO FEEL HEARD. I DON'T KNOW HOW WE WOULD CREATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT IN THE STRUCTURE THAT WE WORK IN BUT WE REALLY DO HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN BLOW OFF A LITTLE STEAM. FEEL SAFE ABOUT IT AND I THINK IT WOULD SAVE US A LOT OF TROUBLE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE. MOST PEOPLE ARE GENERALLY HAPPY WHO HAVE NOT BEEN HARASSED OR ASSAULTED WE'LL HAVE FRUSTRATIONS AT WORK AND I THINK IF WE CAN FIND A WAY TO DO THAT WE MIGHT REALLY GET TO A BETTER PLACE TO WORK. SAYS ONE THAT OUT THERE YEAH I'M SORRY THE POST OFFICE HAS A VERY GOOD MEDIATION PROGRAM PER IO COMPLAINTS CALLED REDRESS THAT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR AWHILE AND. AND THERE'S A PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION OF MEDIATORS I THINK SENSATION CONFLICT RESOLUTION AC ARE MAYBE. THAT HAS A LOT OF INFORMATION ABOUT INTERNAL PROGRAMS FOR MEDIATING DISPUTES THAT. IT SEEMS LIKE A PLACE THAT PEOPLE COULD GO THAT DOESN'T FEEL A SERIOUS IS GOING TO HUMAN RESOURCES ARE GOING TO RULE SWEAR IT REALLY FEELS LIKE YOU'RE GOING THERE TO FILE A COMPLAINT. TO A PLACE THAT YOU CAN GO LIKE YOU SAID THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE. KIND OF PEER TO PEER IN A WAY I RATHER THAN. SOUNDING LIKE YOU'RE THERE TO YOU KNOW FILE SOMETHING FORMAL. TWO QUESTIONS BEFORE I MOVE ON TO MY COLLEAGUES WHO'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY. ON ONE IS YOU. YOU SAID SOMETHING REALLY VERY INTERESTING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'VE HEARD I POINTING AT BOTH OF YOU. ABOUT HOW THERE ARE FEW FALSE COMPLAINTS MEANING THAT THERE ARE VERY FEW TIMES PEOPLE ARE MAKING UP THE FACTS. BUT WHAT DOES HAPPEN IS THE MOTIVATIONS MAYBE SOMEONE UP ON THAT IS PUTTING ON TO AN EVENT IS DIFFERENT THE MOTIVATION THERE PUTTING ON TO THE PERPETRATOR IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE PERPETRATOR. PERCEIVES OR THE REASON WHY THEY WERE DEMOTED IS DIFFERENT THAN THE REASON THEY SUSPECT WHICH IS SORT OF THE COMMON ONE THAT WE SEE A LOT OF YOUR. ORGANIZATIONS. AND I'M WONDERING IF A GOOD INVESTIGATION OPINES ON THAT BECAUSE THAT THEN IF IF MOST OF WHAT THE FACTS THAT YOU'RE GATHERING OR NOT THAT IN DISPUTE EVERYONE SAYS WE WERE THERE AT THIS THIS TIME AND. THIS HAPPEN IT'S JUST I MEANT THIS I DIDN'T MEAN THAT. SO DOES THE INVESTIGATION ALSO LOOK INTO THAT BECAUSE IF NOT THEN HOW IS ANYBODY READING THE INVESTIGATION TO HAVE ANY IDEA. ABOUT REALLY WHETHER SOMEONE WAS TRYING TO SEDUCE OR JUST HAVING A DRINK FOR INSTANCE WHICH IS OFTEN THE CRUX OF A SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ISSUE. SURE I MEAN TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU CAN YOU DON'T WANT TO GO TOO FAR. BUT IF YOU HAVE THIS SITUATION YOU JUST GAVE US A SAMPLE OF A DEMOTION LET'S SAY IN. THAT THE INVESTIGATOR MIGHT FIND THAT IT'S IT'S MORE REASONABLE TO FIND THAT THE DEMOTION HAPPEN BECAUSE OF X. Y. AND Z. THEN IT WAS BASED ON GENDER. DUE TO TE FACT THAT NEAR THERE WERE THESE DEFICIENCIES IN ISSUES IN. AND SO SIMILARLY YEAH I MEAN THE MEANING OF ASKING SOMEBODY FOR A DRINK. THEN BASED ON THE CREDIBILITY OF WHAT THEY SAID YOU'D BE MAKING A FINDING THAT IT WAS MORE OR LESS CREDIBLE THAT THEY DID OR DIDN'T HAVE AN ULTERIOR MOTIVE. FROM AN INVESTIGATION SOME POINT I WANT TO KNOW. IF THE ALLEGATIONS UNSUBSTANTIATED WHETHER THERE IS NONE THE LESS A GOOD FAITH. BELIEF THAT WIPED THE THE PERSON MAKING THE COMPLAINT BELIEVE HAPPENED. WAS TRUE EVEN IF I ACTUALLY IT WASN'T TRUE. I'M BECAUSE IF THERE ISN'T A GOOD FAITH REASON WHY SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE PERCEIVED ABOUT THAT ALSO PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE EMPLOYER. TO TAKE CORRECTIVE ACTION EVEN IN THE ABSENCE OF ANY WRONG DOING YOU CAN SAY HEY I NEED YOU TO KNOW THAT THIS WAS PERCEIVED IT THIS WAY. ARM AND YOU CAN KIND OF INTERVENE IN A NON DISCIPLINARY WAY TO CORRECT. IMPRESSIONS. AND THEN MY SECOND QUESTION ALSO BASED ON SOMETHING YOU SAID WE WE'VE HAD A DISCUSSION KIND OF. INTERNALLY ABOUT. SUPERVISORS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DIRECT ON SORT OF NOT LEGAL TERM OF MANDATORY REPORTER BUT THAT WE'RE EXPECTED. AS MEMBERS FOR INSTANCE OF AN EMPLOYEE TELLS US ABOUT A SITUATION THAT WE'RE EXPECTED TO GO AND. MAKE A REPORT ABOUT IT BUT YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IS TO HAVE THERIGHT KIND OF RESPONSE WHEN THAT PERSON FIRST MAKES EYE CONTACT WITH YOU. SO ARE THEIR BEST PRACTICES OUT THERE THAT WE CAN LOOK AT FOR HOW TO TRAIN OUR SUPERVISORS AND ARE. UNDER OUR TERMS MANDATORY REPORTERS OF HOW TO UNDERSTAND. THE BEST WAY TO ENCOURAGE SOMEONE TO COME FORWARD TO RECOGNIZE THAT THEY MIGHT BE IN TRAUMA OR MIGHT BE FRIGHTENED YOU KNOW WHERE DO WE LOOK TO TO TO TRAIN THOSE PEOPLE. THAT'S OFTEN PART OF THE AB EIGHTEEN TWENTY FIVE TRAINING. THAT I'VE SEEN IN THAT I'VE DONE IS IS SOMETIMES EVEN ROLE PLAYING. AS A SUPERVISOR YOU DON'T HAVE TO INVESTIGATE BUT YOU DO HAVE TO ACCEPT A COMPLAINT SO HERE'S WHAT YOU WOULD DO AND HERE'S HERE'S YOU'D BRING IT TO AND IF YOU CAN'T HANDLE IT YOURSELF. HERE'S WHO YOU'D WALK THIS PERSON TOO SO THAT. BECAUSE SOME PEOPLE REALLY DON'T HAVE THE SKILLS TO DO THIS AND IF THEY DON'T THEY SHOULD GET IT RIGHT AWAY TO THE PERSON WHO DOES INSTEAD OF FUMBLING. THERE ARE TRAININGS THE EOC HAS ROLLED OUT VERY RECENTLY A RESPECTFUL WORKPLACES TRAINING THAT COMES OUT OF THEIR YEAR LONG. SELECTS TASK FORCE ON. PRESSMAN AND THE WORKPLACE. WORK AND THIS RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE TRAINING FOCUSES ON EXACTLY WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED IT'S NOT EVEN REALLY FOCUSED ON LEGAL STANDARDS. IT'S REALLY LIKE WHAT ONE OF THE BEST PRACTICES FROM A TO Z. IN DEALING WITH A COMPLAINT. SOME MEMORY AS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IN THE RIGHT TO SUE LETTER THE TO GIVE TO AN EMPLOYEE. IF THEY SAY WE DON'T NEED YOU TO INVESTIGATE JUST GIVE ME MY RIGHT TO SUE LETTER THEY THEN HAVE HOW LONG TO FILE THEIR LAWSUIT ONE YEAR. AND HOW OFTEN DOES IT HAPPEN THAT THEY COME TO YOU AND THEY SAY I DON'T WANT YOU TO DO ANYTHING I JUST WANT YOU TO GIVE ME. THE RIGHT TO SUE LETTER AND A MAJORITY OF CASES. AND THE THE THE THE THE. BUDGET THE DFG AGE HAS TO INVESTIGATE. WOULD IT BE SUFFICIENT OF MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE SAID WE WANT YOU TO INVESTIGATE NO. THAT IS AN ISSUE. DTH OFTENTIMES. DOESN'T HAVE THE FUNDS TO REALLY DO COMPLETE INVESTIGATIONS. RIGHT. IT IS. AS I SAID HERE IT IS MY GOAL THAT OUR INVESTIGATIONS ARE THOROUGH AND COMPLETE AND THEY MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN ONE YEAR UNLIKE OUR FEDERAL COUNTERPART THE EOC. BUT OUR BUDGET IS BASED ON THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE ACTUALLY INVESTIGATE AS OPPOSED TO THE COMPLAINTS THAT WE ISSUE THE RIGHT TO SUE FOR SO TO THE EXTENT THOSE CO OP. THAT DOES CREATE STOPPING AND WORKLOAD PROBLEMS FOR US YES. ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE EARLIER. YOU YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT DUE PROCESS AND HOW. WE. FOR LACK OF A BETTER PHRASE WE JUMP TO THE GODDESSES. EVERYBODY'S ENTITLED TO PROCESS AND YOU SAID DUE PROCESS IS NOT A LEGAL REQUIREMENT. LET ME LET ME CLARIFY. ANY WORKPLACE THE FAMOUS LINE IS SOMEBODY. IF THERE'S NOT A COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT RIGHT A UNION CONTRACT. THE FAMOUS LINE IS AN EMPLOYER IS ALLOWED TO MAKE A GOOD DECISION A BAD DECISION OR IS ALLOWED TO HAVE A GOOD REASON ABOUT REASON OR NO REASON AT ALL FOR TAKING ACTION AGAINST AN EMPLOYEE. SO LONG AS THE REASON IS NOT DISCRIMINATORY. IN PRACTICE I DON'T REALLY THINK THAT'S TRUE I THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE LITERALLY NO REASON FOR DEMOTING AN EMPLOYEE YOU'RE GONNA GET A COMPLAINT AND SOME FINDER OF FACT IS GOING TO WONDER WHY YOU DID THAT. BUT THE REALITY IS. THE EMPLOYER IS ALLOWED TO TAKE ACTION AGAINST EMPLOYEES WITHOUT ANY KIND OF PROCESS. WHETHER OR NOT IT IS WISE TO DO SO. IT IS NOT A COURT PROCEEDING. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH AN AN ALLEGATION OF WRONGDOING IN A WORKPLACE THERE ARE EMPLOYERS OUT THERE WHO ARE LIKE. ALLEGATION YOU'RE OUT. I DON'T THINK THAT'S WISE I DON'T THINK THAT'S A GOOD EMPLOYMENT PRACTICE BUT IT'S NOT UNLAWFUL. AND SO I JUST WANT TO EVERYONE TO BE ALERT TO THE FACT THAT IF YOU CREATE A SYSTEM. OF. DUE PROCESS. WHATEVER THAT MEANS FOR THE INSTITUTION. THAT IS NOT. WHAT THE LAW REQUIRES IT MIGHT BE A BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDED PRACTICE? BUT IT'S NOT THAT SOMEONE CAN THEN COME AND SAY. I DIDN'T GET TO. CONFRONTED MY ACCUSER PUBLICLY. WELL YOU DON'T GET TO CONFRONT YOUR CONFUSED ACCUSER PUBLICLY THAT'S THAT'S JUST THE WAY THAT IT IS. SO THAT WE'RE CLEAR. UNLESS THERE IS DISCRIMINATION. AND OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD BE ONE OF THE ALLEGATIONS THEN YOU ARE ENTITLED TO DUE PROCESS OR UNLESS THERE IS RETALIATION. RIGHT. NO IF YOU'RE ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING THERE IS NOTHING THAT THE LAW SAYS THAT YOU ARE ENTITLED TO IN A WORKPLACE. UNLESS THERE'S A UNION CONTRACT THAT GIVES YOU CERTAIN. GRIEVANCE RIGHTS OR WHATEVER BUT IF YOU'RE ACCUSED OF WRONGDOING THE EMPLOYER CAN MAKE A DECISION BASED ON ANYTHING THE EMPLOYER WANTS TO DO. NOW YOU MIGHT THEN FILE A COMPLAINT AGAINST YOUR EMPLOYER WHO HASN'T GONE THROUGH CERTAIN STEPS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ALLEGATION IS WELL FOUNDED BUT NO YOU HAVE NO. DEPENDENT RIGHT TO ANY PROCESS. UNLESS THE JOB WAS A RIGHT AS OPPOSED TO PRIVILEGE IF YOU'RE NOT WILLING CHLOE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS TRUE DIRECT AND THERE'S A QUESTION OF WHEN IT BECOMES A RIGHT AS OPPOSED TO PRIVILEGE. RIGHT. I'M JOB ITSELF YOU CAN'T TAKE A RIDE AWAY FROM AN INDIVIDUAL UNLESS YOU GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS. RIGHT BUT A JOB LIKE AN OUT WILL EMPLOYEE DOES NOT HAVE A RIGHT TO THAT SHOP JUST GENERALLY SPEAKING YOU CAN'T TAKE A RIGHT AWAY FROM SOMEONE UNLESS YOU GIVE THEM DUE PROCESS. SO THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHETHER IT WAS A RIGHT TO HAVE A JOB OR PRIVILEGE TO HAVE THAT JOB. I THINK THAT IS ONE WAY OF FRAMING IT YES BUT I'M NOT AWARE OF A JOB THAT IS A RIGHT AND THEN I WILL HAVE A CONTRACT. CERTAINLY YOU DOUBT BUT WELL A CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENT YEAH YOU WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW WHATEVER PROCEDURES ARE IN THE CONTRACT AND THAT'S WHAT THE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS RIGHT. AFTER. ABSENT AN AGREEMENT RIGHT. NO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE IT WAS. OUT ON THE INVESTIGATIONS YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHEN IT'S WORTH DISRUPTING. THE THE THE WORK ENVIRONMENT WHAT DID YOU MEAN BY THAT. WELL AN INVESTIGATION IS GOING TO BE DISRUPTIVE. AND SO. WHAT WHAT IS THE BAR OF THE COMPLAINT? FOR A DETERMINATION TO BE MADE THAT THIS COMPLAINT NEEDS TO BE INVESTIGATED AS I SAID I USUALLY ADVISE. IF IT WOULD BE A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF YOUR RULES AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION TO KNOW WHETHER IT HAPPENED THEN YOU INVESTIGATE. BUT LET'S SAY SOMEBODY COMES WITH A NON SERIOUS. AS LIKE YOU KNOW ONE OF THAT FIRST LEVEL OF COMPLAINT. YOU LOOK LOVELY TODAY I. THE PERSON BROUGHT TH COMPLAINT SAID I PERCEIVE THAT TO BE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. FROM MY EXPERIENCE MORE AND MORE ESPECIALLY PUBLIC EMPLOYERS ARE INVESTIGATING THOSE COMPLAINTS. AND AND THERE IS A COST THERE'S OF AS YOU KNOW IT WAS POINTED OUT THERE'S A COST TO THE TAXPAYER AND THERE'S A COST TO THE WORK ENVIRONMENT. IN TERMS OF RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN PEOPLE LOSS OF PRODUCTIVITY AT CETERA. AND. SOMETIMES I THINK WE'RE GOING TO A POINT WHERE WE'RE INVESTIGATING EVERYTHING. EVEN WHEN IT IS AT SUCH A LOW LEVEL THAT IT WOULDN'T BE A SERIOUS VIOLATION AND ISN'T THERE MIGHT THERE NOT BE ANOTHER WAY OF HANDLING IT THAT WOULD BE. I AM A MORE POSITIVE WAY OF HANDLING THAT PARTICULAR COMPLAINT I MEAN OBVIOUSLY A CERTAIN LEVEL YOU HAVE TO DO THAT. AND CLEARLY WE'RE LOOKING FOR THAT WAY TO HANDLE THOSE COMPLAINTS. THROUGH YOUR EXPERIENCE. WHAT WOULD YOU RECOMMEND THEM? IF WE'RE LOOKING TO DETERMINE WHICH OF THE CASES ARE INVESTIGATED. THERE HAS TO BE A STANDARD. WELL I THINK THAT YOU WOULD LOOK TO LET'S SAY THAT IS THE. THE ALLEGATION IS HE SAID I LOOK LOVELY TODAY. WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A SERIOUS VIOLATION OF YOUR RULES IF THE ANSWER IS NO AND WOULD YOU WOULD YOU TAKE DISCIPLINARY ACTION AGAINST SOMEBODY FOR SAYING THAT. AND I MEAN OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO DO AN INTAKE WAS DID IT HAPPEN MORE THAN ONCE WAS THERE ANY PARTICULAR REASON YOU FOUND THAT SO OFFENSIVE BUT. IF THAT'S REALLY IT. THEN. THAT CASE MIGHT BE ONE WHERE YOU SAY. THAT WOULD VIOLATE OUR RULES BUT I CAN TELL YOU WERE OFFENDED CAN WE GET YOU TO TALK TO GATHER TALK ABOUT THAT CAN WE TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO WORK TOGETHER BETTER SO WE'RE NOT STEPPING ON EACH OTHER'S TOES BUT. THIS IS NOT ONE THAT WOULD GO INTO THE. WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE AND TAKE ACTION BASKET. I THINK THAT BECAUSE. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE ZERO TOLERANCE BEFORE. AND EVEN WITH ZERO TOLERANCE. WE'RE IN THIS SITUATION NOW. THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN MADE THAT WE NOW NEED THAT WE NEED A CULTURE CHANGE. IT HERE THERE IT'S NOT THE ONLY WORK ENVIRONMENT THAT NEEDS A CULTURE CHANGE. THERE'S A CULTURE CHANGE NEEDED IN SO MANY DIFFERENT PLACES. IN THIS CULTURE CHANGE. IS THERE THE THE DANGER OF. LETTING THE PENDULUM SWING TOO FAR TO THE OPPOSITE END. I MEAN I THINK THERE'S. I I WOULD NEED TO UNDERSTAND SPECIFICALLY WHAT YOUR CONCERN IS I MEAN I THINK THERE'S A DANGER AS I SAID IN. BEING TOO HARSH WITH PEOPLE. BUT I DON'T THINK GETTING EVERY COMPLAINT RIGHT BUT I DON'T THINK THERE'S A DANGER IN. DEVELOPING A WORKPLACE THAT HAS RESPECT AS IT'S YOU KNOW UP BOTTOM LINE IN EVERY SITUATION AND THAT PEOPLE ARE. ALWAYS GOING TO SPEAK TO THAT END AND HAVE THAT IS HOW THEY THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE TREATING EACH OTHER SO. ZERO TOLERANCE FOR DISRESPECT. YOU KNOW AND MEANING THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT I DON'T THINK THAT SWINGING TOO FAR BUT IT'S ZERO TOLERANCE MEANS. YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID WAS A MICROGRAPHS YOU SHOULD BE FIRED FOR IT THEN YEAH THAT WOULD BE SWINGING TOO FAR. IN MY LAST QUESTION IS. WHEN WE HIRE AN OUTSIDE FIRM TO DO THE INVESTIGATION WE TALK ABOUT ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE. WHO'S THE CLIENT THAT HAS THE PRIVILEGE BOTH THE LEGISLATURE THERE OR THAT THE SENATOR THE ASSEMBLY WHOEVER. WHATEVER ENTITY IS HIRING THAT AS OPPOSED TO THE VICTIM WHO'S WHO IS. GIVING THE INFORMATION. WELL THE THE VICTIM. ISN'T IT HOWARD TO FIX THE SITUATION INVESTIGATED. AND I MEAN THAT IT ISN'T A BALANCE SITUATION IT'S IT'S THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAS TO BE RESPONDING. AND DOING THE INVESTIGATION OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT HAS THE ACCESS TO THAT THE INFORMATION TO DO THAT AND CAN EMPOWER SOMEBODY. TO DO THAT THEY CAN OPEN THE DOORS AND SAY HERE ARE FILES INVESTIGATOR. FIND WHAT YOU NEED TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATOR MORLOCK. I'M SURE. MR KISCH WELCOME BACK THANK YOU. I FAILED TO ASK YOU A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. LAST TIME. AND IT WAS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY. AND YOU SAID ALL THE RECORDS ARE AVAILABLE SO I'M JUST CURIOUS HAS ANYONE FILED A HARASSMENT. COMPLAINT ON A. LEGISLATOR WITH YOUR DEPARTMENT. I'VE BEEN OUT WHAT TIME FRAME. FOR ME. WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE IT'S HAPPENED QUITE A BIT TO BY THE WAY YOU'RE ANSWERING IT SO IT'S LIKE WAS IT LAST WEEK WHEN I DON'T KNOW I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THE WRONG IMPRESSION I'M AWARE OF ONE RIGHT TO SUE. THAT WAS THAT WAS FILED BUT I'S THE ONE THAT'S BEEN REPORTED IN THE PRESS AND I DON'T HAVE ANY INFORMATION ABOUT OTHER ONES ALTHOUGH I KNOW THAT REPORTERS HAVE BEEN ASKING AND THERE ARE. THERE HAVE BEEN VERY FEW SLASHING NINE FOR MANY PERIODS. WHICH LET ME JUST CLARIFY I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD FIND SURPRISING. BECAUSE WHEN FOLKS ARE IN POSITIONS. WHERE REPUTATIONAL HARM? IS A CORE CONCERN. POSITIONS WHERE IT'S POSSIBLE TO GET A MONETARY SETTLEMENT. YOU'RE NOT DEALING WITH AN INSOLVENT RESPOND IN A LOT OF TIMES WHAT WILL HAPPEN IS THAT SOMEONE WHO EXPERIENCES SOMETHING WE'LL JUST HIRE A ATTORNEY AND EVERYTHING WILL BE HANDLED VERY QUIETLY WITHOUT THE STATE'S INTERVENTION. MR KISCH DO YOU HAVE A MODEL. POLICY ON DEALING WITH SEXUAL HARASSMENT THAT WE CAN. TAKE AS A. TEMPLATE YES AND THAT IS ATTACHED IT IS NOW ON THE WEBSITE IT IS OUR. PLEASE HARASSMENT GUIDE THIS IS THE MODEL. HOW TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION WE HAVE ALSO BEEN WORKING ON OUR OWN INTERNAL ANTI DISCRIMINATION POLICY WHICH I THINK IT IS ONLY FAIR TO ME I MEAN IT IS PUBLIC IS A PUBLIC DOCUMENT BECAUSE REPUBLICAN CITY BUT I THINK IT'S? FAIR FOR US TO PUT ON THE WEBSITE AND THAT WILL BE HAPPENING. PROBABLY WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS. OKAY. MISS. OPPENHEIMER WELCOME I AM. I TO APPRECIATE ALL THE. EXPERIENCE YOU HAVE THAT WAS A TERM USED EARLIER AND I JUST WANTED TO. CAN I GO BACK TO THIS HIGH SCHOOL STARTING THING YOU KNOW OR MAYBE OUR OUR OUR. PERPETRATORS ARE THEY SORT OF LIKE EVOLVE TO THEY. START BAD HABITS SOMEWHERE JUST KINDA KEEP BUILDING THEM LIKE EVER REPROBATE BEHAVIOR. I'M TRYING TO THINK OF SAY. AN ALCOHOLIC WHO JUST SOMEHOW I WAS ABLE TO KEEP IT HIDDEN FROM EVERYBODY BUT IS STILL. DOING THINGS OR AN EMBEZZLER WHO JUST SEEMS TO WORK FOR YOU THINK SHE'S HERE SHE IS THE MOST WONDERFUL PERSON. BUT THIS SLOWLY SIPHONING THINGS ARE. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT IF SINCE WE SINCE THE CENTER MAJORITY MENTION THE NINETY TEN RULE I'M KIND OF USED TO THAT EIGHTY TWENTY RULE. OUT OF THEM. ARE WE TALKING ABOUT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE. MAYBE BULLIES IN HIGH SCHOOL AND JUST THE OTHER IN THE WORKPLACE AND. AND THEY'VE NEVER BEEN CONFRONTED AND THEY JUST KEEP GETTING AWAY WITH IT. AND THEN HERE WE ARE ALL OF A SUDDEN SOMEONE FINALLY FILES A COMPLAINT LIKE. ARGUMENTS AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN AT ALL SAID IT BLOWS UP IN ITS. ITS MULTIPLES ARE A PRETTY MADE OFFER FOR TALKING ABOUT. DEALING WITH SOMEONE'S MONEY STARS KIND OF CURIOUS IS ONE ESERVER. IS IS IT JUST SOMETHING THAT STARTS AT AN EARLY AGE IN AND DEMAND TO HOW DO WE DEAL WITH IT. WELL I DO THINK THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE PERPETRATING VERY SERIOUS ACTIONS. THAT. IT IS SOMEBODY WHO HAS SOME PERSONALITIES THAT YOU KNOW SOME FOR SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS WHO HAS A LOT OF POWER AND THE FACT IS THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE HAVE A LOT OF POWER WHO. DO HAVE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEMS IT'S THEY DON'T NECESSARILY. AND THEY'RE NOT NECESSARILY SEPARATE. I MEAN YET I THINK THAT WE ALSO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE LESS SERIOUS WE TEACH. GENDER ROLES. FROM A VERY EARLY AGE IN A WAY THAT. OFTEN TEACHES PEOPLE TO CROSS LINES AND SO SURE I MEAN I THINK. EDUCATION NOT I WOULD TAKE IT EVEN EARLIER. I MEAN I. I REMEMBER BEING AT MY SCHOOLS BY AND KIDS SCHOOLING HEARING PEOPLE PUTTING EACH OTHER DOWN BY SAYING YOU'RE GAY YOU*. AND EVERY TIME I WOULD STEP IN AND THEY WOULD SAY MOM YOU HAVE TO STEP IN EVERY TIME YOU HEAR THIS ON. YEAH SORRY I DO AND I'M. IT'S IT'S ENDEMIC AND. I WOULD I'D LOVE TO SEE. THAT CHANGE I THINK THAT COULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. BUT THEN WHEN YOU DO AN INVESTIGATION DO YOU ALSO DO A PSYCHOLOGICAL REVIEW NO NOT QUALIFIED TO DO THAT I MEAN IT'S IT'S HARD NOT TO WONDER BUT I DON'T HAVE THE QUALIFICATIONS TO DIAGNOSE. WELL THEN WOULD YOU SUBCONTRACT THAT. YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK IT'S OUR PLACE I THINK THAT WE'RE FACT FINDERS AND REGARDLESS OF THE PSYCHOLOGY OF IT YOU KNOW THAT THE FACTS ARE THE FACTS AND. IT'S HARD NOT TO WONDER IN NOTICE BUT I I THINK THAT'S OVERSTEPPING. WELL I COME FROM UP THE COUNTING BACKGROUND AND SO. YOU LOOK FOR FRAUD WHEN YOU'RE DOING AUDITS. AND SO SO OFTEN. SOMEONE WILL BE DISCOVERED AND THEN YOU'LL SIT DOWN WITH THE PERSON AND THEY'LL SAY WELL YOU CAN LET ME GO AND ALL SIGN. I PROMISSORY NOTE I'LL PAY YOU BACK AND THEN EVERYBODY KEEPS A QUIET. AND THEN THEY GO TO ANOTHER PLAYER AND SLOWLY BUT SURELY THEY'RE SENDING MONEY TO THE OLD EMPLOYER BUT IT'S COMING OUT OF THE POCKET OF. THE NEW EMPLOYER SO THINGS JUST. NEVER GET FIXED YOU KNOW IT'S JUST. IN IN MISTER KIDS WHO HAD THIS DISCUSSION BEFORE AND I'M. JUST. WONDERING IF MAYBE WE'RE MISSING A COMPONENT IN IN IN OUR INVESTIGATION SO I I JUST BRING THAT UP SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. BY ME MADAM CHAIR DIDN'T DO THAT SENATOR MORE LOCKED AND I AGREE WITH YOU I WOULD JUST ADD ONE COMPONENT TO YOUR ARGUMENT THAT IS THAT WE CAN'T START IN HIGH SCHOOL COMING FROM EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION BACKGROUND. REMEMBER THE FAMOUS BESTSELLER EVERYTHING I NEEDED TO KNOW I LEARNED IN KINDERGARTEN I THINK WE NEED TO START MUCH EARLIER BECAUSE I THINK THE KIND OF WORKPLACE BULLYING BEHAVIOR WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS FALLS UNDER THE PARADIGM OF BULLYING YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ALMOND AND. AS WE HEARD EARLIER NEEDING TO FIND THE BALANCE IN TERMS OF OF THE LACK ELECTRIC HAVING THE POWER TO DECIDE WHO REPRESENTS THEM. EIGHT BE THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T LEGISLATE MORALITY. WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CREATE A SYSTEM AND A CULTURE THAT WHAT EVER. CHARACTERISTIC YOU BRING TO THE WORK SPACE WHATEVER THAT MAY BE THEY CAN'T DO PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING WE CAN'T REQUIRE PSYCHOLOGICAL TESTING OUR ACCU TESTING BEFORE YOU GET A NAME YOUR NAME ON THE BALLOT. WHAT WE CAN DO IS CREATE A CULTURE IN WHICH? WHAT EVER YOU BRING TO THE SPACE YOU UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CERTAIN BEHAVIORS THAT WON'T BE TOLERATED? AND I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS SOME OF THE BULLYING CHARACTERS BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT. THOSE PEOPLE ARE ATTRACTED TO POSITIONS OF POWER SO THEY CAN BULLY. AND SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THE SETTING IN WHICH WE ARE IN WHICH IS ALL THE MORE REASON TO CREATE A CULTURE. IN WHICH THE INSTITUTION SAYS DON'T CROSS THIS LINE. WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT YOUR CONSTITUENTS WILL LET YOU. IN THEY SEE VALUE IN WHAT YOU CAN BRING TO THEIR DISTRICT HOWEVER IF YOU CAN BE A PART THIS INSTITUTION. YOU CAN'T CROSS THIS LINE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO PROTECT. THE PUBLIC AND EMPLOYEES BUT I THINK WE CAN'T START THE MESSAGING AROUND BULLYING. AND GENDER APPROPRIATE INTERACTION TO BEHAVE YOU CAN START EARLY ENOUGH. WE SEE AS THE EARLY CAN EDUCATION PROFESSIONAL WE SEE. CHARACTERISTICS EXHIBITED VERY YOUNG. THEY'RE YOUNG WOULD GETS LITTLE CIRCULAR. HER MITCHELL WHO I AM. WE NEED TO TRAIN AND AND TEACH KIDS THAT THEIR BOUNDARIES. BUT THEN IT'S A DOLL FIGURE. DIDN'T HAPPEN HUNDREDS ARE GONNA WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL. ARE YOU COOL FOR WHY ARE YOU REACTING THIS WAY YOU CHOSE TO REACT THAT WAY ALL I WAS DOING WAS. BRING YOUR COMPLIMENT OR WHATEVER IT IS AND AND SO I'M YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW WE'RE SPENDING OUR TIME ON THIS SUBJECT I'M. TRYING TO YOU KNOW. DIG INTO DIFFERENT AREAS TRYING TO FIGURE FIGURE IT ALL OUT BUT. YOU KNOW WHO WE ARE WHO WE DON'T HAVE A SOUTHERN. APPROACH OF GENTLEMEN AND LADIES AND EVERYONE KNOWS THEIR PLACE AND EVERYONE IS CUT THE RIGHT DECORUM. THE WHOLE DIFFERENT I THINK A LITTLE DIFFERENT WORLD IF I COULD. SO I'M JUST BRINGING IT UP. THAT. THANK YOU THANKS THAT I WANTED TO COMMENT ON ARMS ACTUALLY SOMETHING THAT IS SOMEONE NUMBER RADIO SAID THAT REALLY GOT ME THINKING ABOUT THE PENDULUM SWING TOO FAR AND I'VE HEARD THIS A LOT SORT OF IN THE. POPULAR CULTURE IN THE MEDIA REGARDS TO THIS YOU KNOW WE DON'T THE PENDULUM HAS SWUNG TOO FAR. BUT IT IT'S REALLY A GOOD REMINDER AND WE TALKED ABOUT THIS WHEN WE HAD OUR. CULTURE CHANGE PANEL THAT IF YOU'RE PENDULUM IS A PENDULUM BETWEEN. LOTS OF PUNISHMENT RULES AND A LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING TO HAVE THAT PROBLEM BUT IF YOU'RE PENDULUM THAT YOU'RE FOCUSED ON. IS ON THE ONE HAND A WORKPLACE WHERE PEOPLE ARE RESPECTED AND FEEL SAFE AND EMPLOYEES FEEL EMPOWERED TO COME FORWARD IF THEY'RE. BEING TREATED BADLY AND ON THE OTHER HAND WE'RE PLACE IT DOESN'T DO THAT THEN YOU'RE PENDULUM CANCELING TOO FAR BECAUSE YOU ALWAYS WANT YOUR PENDULUM TO BE AS FAR AS YOU CAN ON THE SIDE OF. A WORKPLACE THAT RESPECTS EVERYBODY'S INDIVIDUAL SO MORE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEIR. GOING TO BE TREATED AS A HUMAN BEING AND SOMEONE WHO'S PRODUCTIVE SO IF WE THINK ABOUT THAT. THAT I THINK THAT HELPS TO KEEP US CLARIFIED ABOUT WHAT OUR GOAL REALLY IS HERE IT'S NOT TO HAVE MORE PUNISHMENT MORE RULES A MORE TOXIC PLACE TO COME TO WORK AT THE END OF THE DAY ALTHOUGH WE MIGHT NEED SOME OF THAT ALONG THE WAY AND WE NEED. THAT ACCOUNTABILITY OUR GOAL IS TO HAVE A PLEASANT PLACE FOR PEOPLE TO WORK WHERE THEY ARE RESPECTED AND WHERE THEIR CONTRIBUTIONS ARE RESPECTED AND WHERE THEY FEEL SAFE. SO WE CAN NEVER SWING TOO FAR IN THAT DIRECTION. UNLESS THERE'S ANY LAST QUESTIONS FOR THIS PANEL I WANT TO THANK YOU THAT WAS EXCELLENT SUPER HELPFUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I'M SURE WE'LL BE IN TOUCH AND WE HAVE A LAST PANEL. WHICH I'M SURE WILL BE JUST AS EXCELLENT I'M AND I'M GOING TO INVITE UP PATRICIA WEISS MEMBER OF THE EOC TASK FORCE ON HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE. AND FOR NEAR DAVIS THE CO FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR OAKLAND YOUTH. AND JUST AS I HAD ASKED THE LAST PANEL PLEASE FEEL FREE TO. INTRODUCE YOURSELF IN YOUR ORGANIZATIONS AS YOU SEE FIT AS YOU MOVE INTO YOUR PRESENTATIONS THANK YOU OKAY NOW. ON THE BOARD ABOUT IT'S NOT OKAY. THIS PERSON FOR IT TO GO YEAH. OKAY. WELCOME AND I THINK WE'RE STARTING WITH MS WEISS YES THANK YOU. THANK YOU TERRY FRIEDMAN BASED CHAIR MITCHELL AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE. FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY FIRST OF ALL. AND FOR YOUR IMPORTANT WORK IN ESTABLISHING A BICAMERAL PROCESS TO PREVENT AND ELIMINATE SEXUAL HARASSMENT. MIGHT. BEEN FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO SEE SOME OF THE PREVIOUS TESTIMONY THAT YOU'VE HEARD. AND READ SOME OF THE MATERIALS THAT YOU'VE USED IN YOUR PREVIOUS HEARINGS. BOMB WORK HERE OBVIOUSLY BECAUSE YOU HAVE A DESIRE TO IMPROVE. PREVENT AND ELIMINATE HARASSMENT IN THE WORKPLACE AND IN THE PAST. BASED ON THE LAWS AND THE REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE IMPOSED ON YOU. THAT'S GENERALLY BEEN DONE IN THREE WAYS AND THOSE ARE LEGALLY COMPLIANT POLICIES AGAINST HARASSMENT. TRAINING AND CONDUCTING PROMPT OBJECTIVE AND THOROUGH INVESTIGATIONS. BUT I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT EMPLOYERS HAVE ACTUALLY. BEEN DOING A GOOD JOB WITH THAT WITH THOSE COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. FOR DECADES LITERALLY FOR DECADES EMPLOYERS HAVE DONE A GOOD JOB WITH COMPLIANCE EFFORTS. AND WE'VE SEEN REALLY NO IMPROVEMENT. EVEN THOUGH EMPLOYERS ARE ARE FAIRLY GOOD AT COMPLIANCE WE'VE SEEN NO REAL IMPROVEMENT AND THE NUMBERS OF CHARGES THAT EOC AND STATE AGENCIES HAVE SEEN. AND THE COURT CASES HAVE REALLY NOT CHANGED THROUGH THE DECADES BOMB. I BELIEVE. THAT MOST COMMITTED EMPLOYERS CAN DO A BETTER JOB. I BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS CAN DO FAR MORE. THEN CHECK THE BOX FAR MORE THAN JUST COMPLIANCE AND I I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT YOU ARE TAKING. I AM INFORMED ABOUT THIS APPROACH MORE THAN COMPLIANCE MORE THAN CHECK IN THE BOX AND I BELIEVE THAT EMPLOYERS CAN GO FAR BEYOND THAT BASED ON MY WORK WITH THE EOC. AND THE SELECT TASK FORCE MOM I KNOW THAT YOU READ THE REPORT IS PART OF THE MATERIALS FOR THESE HEARINGS. AND. HOPEFULLY YOU CAN SEE THAT THERE'S SO MUCH POTENTIAL BASED ON THE EIGHTEEN MONTHS OF WORK THAT WE DID. IN STUDYING THE ISSUE OF PREVENTION AND ELIMINATION OF. WORKPLACE HARASSMENT I BELIEVE THESE HEARINGS SHOW THAT YOU'RE ALREADY FAR ALONG IN THE PROCESS OF ESTABLISHING THE FIRST ELEMENT THAT THE TASK FORCE IDENTIFIED AS. THE MOST IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THE PROCESS AND THAT IS LEADERSHIP. AND I'VE HEARD YOU TALK A LOT ABOUT LEADERSHIP. THE FIRST STEP IN CREATING A HOLISTIC HARASSMENT PREVENTION PROGRAM IS LEADERSHIP. THESE HEARINGS HAVE BEEN CRITICAL I THINK IN DEMONSTRATING YOUR COMMITMENT TO THAT. AND I KNOW THAT YOU'VE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CHANGING THE CULTURE WHICH IS CERTAINLY AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF ESTABLISHING LEADERSHIP AND I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF TESTIMONY ABOUT THAT. ONE OF THE IDEAS THAT I LIKE TO THINK ABOUT IN TERMS OF CHANGING CULTURE IS IT A BASIC MANAGEMENT PRINCIPLE. AND THAT IS THE SHADOW OF A LEADER. AND I THINK THAT YOU PROBABLY ALL KNOW THAT YOU CAST A SHADOW AS LEADERS. I'M GONNA SHARE AN EXAMPLE FROM A DIFFERENT STATE. OF HOW A SHADOW WAS CAST IN AN UNFORTUNATE WAY. AND I THINK IT ILLUSTRATES PERFECTLY WHAT ALL OF YOU CAN DO AS LEADERS IN YOUR STATE. THIS WAS A SITUATION WHERE. MORE THAN ONE HUNDRED MEMBERS OF OF. A LEGISLATIVE BODY AND THEIR STAFFERS WERE TOGETHER TO CELEBRATE THE RETIREMENT OF A STAFFER. AND TWO MEMBERS MADE REMARKS. AT THE RETIREMENT PARTY AND IT WAS A DINNER SEATED DINNER. AND. THOSE REMARKS WERE INAPPROPRIATE. THEY WERE MISOGYNISTIC.AND THEY WERE. ACTUALLY TARGETED AT INDIVIDUAL FEMALE LEGISLATE TOWARDS ONE A SITTING MEMBER OF THE BODY AND ONE ON THE FORMER AND FORMER MEMBER WHO IS NOT PRESENT THE THE SITTING MEMBER WAS PRESENT IN THE AUDIENCE. OF THE SPEAKER WAS ALSO PRESENT. AND. SO THESE ARE VERY INAPPROPRIATE REMARKS ONE OF THE SPEAKERS ACTUALLY USED THE C. WORD. TO DESCRIBE ONE OF THE FEMALE MEMBERS. AND. NOTHING HAPPENED. THE DINNER WENT ON. AND AFTER THE DINNER THE SPEAKER SENT A LETTER TO THE TWO. MEMBERS WHO HAD SPOKEN. AND SAID THAT THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. AND THE TWO MEMBERS SENT LETTERS OF APOLOGY. AND THAT'S THAT'S IT THERE WERE NO SANCTIONS. AND WHEN I THINK OF THE SHADOW OF A LEADER. I THINK OF WHAT COULD HAVE HAPPENED. AND MESSAGE THAT COULD BEEN SENT NOT JUST TO THE PEOPLE THERE THAT NIGHT BUT TO EVERYONE IN STATE GOVERNMENT IF THE SPEAKER HAD STOOD UP. GONE TO THE PODIUM AND MADE THOSE THOSE MEN SIT DOWN. AND SAD TO THE ENTIRE AUDIENCE I APOLOGIZE I'M SORRY FOR THOSE REMARKS I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO HEAR THAT WE DON'T ACCEPT THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE. CAN AND NOT OPPORTUNITY WAS LOST. AND INSTEAD THE VERY CLEAR MESSAGE WAS. WELL WE TOLERATE THAT. MAYBE WE WRITE A LETTER AFTERWARDS BUT BASICALLY WE TALLER. AND I THINK THE WHOLE IDEA OF THE SHADOW OF A LEADER AND AND WHAT LEADERS DO. IS SO CRITICAL IN THIS AREA OF HARASSMENT IN ANY CHANGE THAT YOU WANT TO MAKE. SO I THINK THERE ARE MANY MANY THINGS THAT CAN BE DONE EVEN TO IMPROVE YOUR COMPLIANCE EFFORTS AND AGAIN I THINK YOU LIKE MOST EMPLOYERS ARE COMPLIANCE EFFORTS ARE GOOD. WE WE'VE BEEN DOING WELL AS EMPLOYERS FOR DECADES. BUT I THINK THERE'S THERE'S MORE TO BE DONE THERE BUT THIS IDEA OF OF THE LEADERS IN THE SHADOWS THEY CAST IS. IS REALLY SO SIGNIFICANT PALM I IN ONE OF THE. THIS IS TESTIMONY THAT I SAW WHEN I WAS PREPARING FOR THIS. HEARING TODAY I SAW ON. THE WITNESSES SAID THAT A CULTURE EATS STRATEGY FOR BREAKFAST AND POLICY FOR LUNCH. AND I LIKE THAT AND I THINK IT MAY BE TRUE BUT I WILL SAY THAT IF IT IS TRUE. CULTURE SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD DIET SO YOU'VE GOT TO PAY ATTENTION AND BE MINDFUL OF THE POLICY AND THE STRATEGY AS WELL. IN FACT THE THE SELECT TASK FORCE THE REPORT FROM THE EOC DOES SUGGEST THAT YOU. IMPROVE WHAT IS AN ALREADY COMPLIANT POLICY. YOU IMPROVE YOUR TRAINING. AND WE WE REALLY FOUND THAT TRAINING THAT'S BEEN CONDUCTED BY BY EMPLOYERS FOR DECADES IS REALLY IT'S NOT EFFECTIVE SO ALL EMPLOYERS REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THAT. AND THAT WE CONSIDER ADDING ADDITIONAL TYPES OF TRAINING CIVILITY AND RESPECT WAS AT THE TOP OF OUR LIST. WE FOUND. YES AND WE FOUND THAT. DISRESPECT IN CIVILITY AND TOLERANCE. THOSE THINGS IN THE WORKPLACE REALLY WERE THOSE WERE A GATEWAY. WE WE. WE DIDN'T JOKE WASN'T FUNNY BUT WE WE KIND OF USE THE TERM THEY WERE GATEWAY DRUG FOR HARASSMENT IF YOU ALLOWED DISRESPECT AND INCIVILITY IN THE WORKPLACE YOU COULD EXPECT. HARASSMENT TO FOLLOW SO. THE EOC DID AS AS THE LAST PANEL MENTIONED THEY'VE DEVELOPED AN ENTIRE. NEW TRAINING MODULE ON RESPECT IN THE WORKPLACE. BOMB BYSTANDER TRAINING THAT'S A SOMETHING IT'S A TOOL THAT WE'VE NOT UTILIZE WE STUDIED A LOT OF WHAT COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES HAVE BEEN DOING THEY'VE BEEN THEY'VE DEVELOPED SOME REALLY EFFECTIVE BYSTANDER TECHNIQUES. WHICH CAN BE ADAPTED FOR THE WORK PLACE VERY EFFECTIVELY. IMPLICIT BIAS AND I THINK YOU'RE YOU HAVE. WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THAT ON THIS IN THESE HEARINGS AS WELL THAT'S VERY EFFECTIVE I'M YOUR SUPERVISORS. AGAIN THE LAST PANEL TALKED ABOUT SUPERVISORS AND THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR ROLE AND THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEY DON'T THEY DON'T NEED TO BECOME EXPERTS ON HARASSMENT. SOME WILL SUMMER CAPABLE OF THAT SUMMER NOT THEY JUST NEED TO UNDERSTAND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY ABOUT MOVING ISSUES FORWARD KNOWING WHERE TO TAKE A PERSON OR WHAT TO DO WITH THE PERSON WHO HAS A COMPLAINT. YOUR INVESTIGATORS ON TO THE EXTENT YOU USE INTERNAL INVESTIGATORS AND I TOO AM VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF INTERNAL INVESTIGATORS. UP TO A SITUATION WHERE THE INVESTIGATOR DOESN'T. IT IS REPORTING LITERALLY A SUBORDINATE TO ON EITHER THE THE VICTIM THE ALLEGED VICTIM OR ON THE PERSON WHO'S ACCUSED IF THEY HAVE AUTHORITY OVER THE INVESTIGATOR. THAT'S OBVIOUSLY NOT A SITUATION THAT CAN WORK BUT BUT SHORT OF THAT. AND AND THE PEOPLE THEN WHO ARE INVESTIGATORS THE NEED CONTINUAL TRAINING. ARM AND AND THEY WILL APPRECIATE THAT THOUGH THE ONE OF THE KEEP IMPROVING. ON ADDITIONAL SINCE ONE OF POTENTIAL A SOLUTION I'VE SEEN IN SOME WORKPLACES AN ARM BUT THIS PERSON. AND THAT MIGHT BE SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT WHO CAN TAKE THOSE KINDS OF THOSE ISSUES THAT DON'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF HARASSMENT. ARM AND THEN ANOTHER KEY STRATEGY THAT THE TASK FORCE RECOMMENDS IS ELIMINATING FIRST IDENTIFYING. AND THEN ELIMINATING RISK FACTORS IN THE WORKPLACE AND WE IDENTIFIED GENERALLY SOME RISK FACTORS THAT WE SAW AS WE SURVEYED CASES THAT HAD DEVELOPED IN THE AREA OF HARASSMENT. AND YOU HAVE I'D JUST AS I WENT THROUGH THE LIST OF IDENTIFIED RISK FACTORS AND AND YOU HAVE SOME SPECIFIC ONES I'M SURE THAT I'M NOT AWARE OF WHICH IS GENERALLY. YOU HAVE A LOT OF YOUNGER EMPLOYEES EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ON PERHAPS THEIR FIRST OR SECOND NON JOB AND I THINK THAT TIES IN. WITH WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. MEMBER MORLOCK ABOUT OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS AND TO ANSWER A LITTLE BIT ONE OF YOUR QUESTIONS THE EOC HAS SPECIFIC TRAINING FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS I DO AGREE THAT'S TOO LATE BUT. OFTEN HAVE A LEASE TRY TO REACH THEM BEFORE THEY HAVE THEIR FIRST JOB SO THEY KNOW WHAT TO EXPECT BUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS WITH THE YOUNG WORK FORCE. NOT SUGGESTING YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE THEM BUT SOME OF THE PROBLEMS ARE THEY DON'T AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO UNDERSTAND. OUR WHAT TO EXPECT IN A WORKPLACE THEY'VE BEEN IN A DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THEY'VE BEEN IN A COLLEGE ENVIRONMENT. SO THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND KIND OF HOW THINGS SHOULD WORK AND IF THEY SEE A CERTAIN ENVIRONMENT WHERE INAPPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR IS TOLERATED OR INCIVILITY DISRESPECT IS THE NORM. THAT'S WHAT THEY KNOW THEN AS A WORKPLACE SO ON AND THEY ARE ALSO MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE. MAYBE OLDER OR WHO HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE CERTAINLY. THEY'RE HIGHER IN AUTHORITY. SO THAT'S A PROBLEM AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO ENGAGE IN MISCONDUCT BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE MATURED AND THEY DON'T HAVE EXPERIENCE SO IF THEY SEE OTHERS ENGAGING IN MISCONDUCT AGAIN THEY JUST ASSUME THAT THAT'S APPROPRIATE. THEY ALSO LACK THE CONFIDENCE. OF HAVING EXPERIENCE OF A LACK CONFIDENCE TO CHALLENGE BEHAVIORS THAT THAT MAYBE THEY EVEN THEY DO THINK THAT THEY'RE INAPPROPRIATE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT THOSE BEHAVIORS. AND SO AGAIN FOR THEM TRAINING IS CRITICAL AND I'LL COME BACK TO THAT CONCEPT OF THE SHADOW OF THE LEADER. WHAT ARE THEY SEEING THE LEADERS DO WHAT IS THAT THE SHADOW THAT'S BEING PASSED ON? YOU ALSO HAVE CLEARLY A WORKPLACE WITH HIGH VALUE EMPLOYEES. AND THAT TOO HAS SOME OF THE SAME RISKS. THEY MAY BE PERMITTED TO. OPERATE OUTSIDE THE RULES OR THEY MAY PERCEIVE THAT THEY ARE PERMITTED ON THE RULES DON'T APPLY TO THEM IS KIND OF THE. THE SUPERSTAR HARASSER IF YOU WILL IS THE TERM THAT WE USED FOR THOSE AGAIN RULES NEED TO BE APPLIED UNIFORMLY HOW YOU KNOW HOW IS THE LEADERSHIP HOW ARE THEY TREATING THOSE PEOPLE. SIGNIFICANT POWER DISPARITIES. CERTAINLY YOU HAVE SIGNIFICANT POWER DISPARITIES AMONG PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERACTING IN THIS WORKPLACE. BOMB. ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION. I AM TOLD THAT I'M AT TIMES THERE MIGHT BE ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION DURING AN AROUND WORK HOURS THAT'S A RISK FACTOR WE ALL KNOW THAT. WILL. REDUCE INNOVATIONS IMPAIRED JUDGMENT SO AGAIN. THOSE DECISIONS HAVE TO BE MADE WHAT WHAT ARE THE WHAT SHOULD. WHAT WE WANT IN OUR CULTURE MOVE MAYBE WE DON'T WANNA CHANGE IT AT ALL BUT WE WANT TO BE MINDFUL OF THAT AND THE RISKS THAT THAT COULD? POTENTIALLY CREATE. CRUDE OR DEMEANING LANGUAGE. SOMETIMES THAT'S THE NORM IN A WORKPLACE AND. THERE'S NO RULE AGAINST IT. SOMETIMES A WORKPLACE WILL DECIDE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE NO PROFANITY WHATSOEVER AGAIN A CULTURAL CHOICE BUT UNDERSTAND THAT THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE MAY DEVALUE. CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS OR GROUPS. SOME EMPLOYEES IF THEY DO WANT TO OR IF THEY DO EXPRESS AN OPINION. AGAINST THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE. THEY MAY BE VIEWED AS A KIND OF OUTCASTS AND MAY BE VIEWED AS A WEAKER. SO AGAIN THE CULTURE THE SHADOW OF A LEADER THOSE KINDS OF THINGS SO. PART OF YOUR EFFORTS I THINK SHOULD BE. TARGETED AT IDENTIFYING THE SPECIFIC RISK FACTORS THAT YOU SEE AND. AND THEN RESOLVING THOSE ISSUES RESOLVING THOSE RISK FACTORS AND THEN SOMEONE WILL SAY HOW DO WE DO THAT AND I WILL SAY. THAT'S UP TO ALL OF YOU AND BY ALL OF YOU I WOULD SAY ENGAGE YOUR WORK FORCE. I CAN'T ANSWER THAT FOR YOU BUT I WILL I WILL TELL YOU YOUR STAFF THEY KNOW PROBABLY A LOT MORE. ABOUT THIS THIS. WORK SPACE. THEN ALL OF YOU DO AND SO I WOULD ENGAGE THEM DO A CLIMATE SURVEY DO FOCUS GROUPS GET THEIR INPUT. IF THERE'S AN ISSUE THAT YOU WANT TO DRESS ASK THEM. WATER IDEAS THAT THEY HAVE FOR SOLVING THAT AND HOW DO YOU ADDRESS THOSE RISK FACTORS SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS ON. THAT I WOULD SUGGEST FOR ABOUT IN TERMS OF LEADERSHIP. THIS HAS TO BE THAT LEADERS WHO ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE. FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD POPULAR WHO CAN LEAD A CULTURE CHANGE WHO PEOPLE LOOK UP TO ENGAGE THOSE PEOPLE AS WELL. AND ALLOCATE THE RESOURCES AND I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS MEAN DOLLARS. BUT THE DOLLARS THAT ARE ALLOCATED USE THOSE EFFECTIVELY AND THAT'S ANOTHER REASON AGAIN THAT I WOULD REALLY SUPPORT. INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS UP TO ABOUT THAT LEVEL OF AND I THINK THAT. YOU KNOW YOU YOU'VE PROBABLY GOT I'VE MET SOME OF THE PEOPLE HERE ARE. A LOT OF TOWN INTERNALLY BUT YOU KNOW YOU CAN. YOUR OWN INVESTIGATORS THEY KNOW YOUR CULTURE. THEY KNOW THEY KNOW A PERSON'S EMPLOYMENT HISTORY THE PERSON WHO YOU KNOW PEOPLE AND ALL THE WITNESSES THEY KNOW THOSE PEOPLE. FAR MORE THAN WHAT THEY WOULD FIND IN A PERSONNEL FILE RIGHT SO YOU GIVE UP A LOT OF THAT INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE. WHEN YOU GO OUTSIDE AND OBVIOUSLY IT'S A LOT MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO DO THAT AS WELL. MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE REPORTING SYSTEM IS WORKING. I WOULD SUGGEST YOU SHOULD TEST THE SYSTEM. KLAY. CREATE A CLAIM AND SEE IF WHAT HAPPENS TO IT. WHERE DOES IT GO MAKE SURE IT'S WORKING? DISCIPLINE OF COURSE SHOULD BE PROPORTIONATE I THINK THAT YOU ALL HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT THAT. AND THAT'S ANOTHER THING THAT INTERNAL INVESTIGATORS CAN HELP WITH THEY CAN REMEMBER THE LAST TIME SOMEONE WAS ACCUSED OF SOMETHING SIMILAR. AND HOW THAT TURNED OUT TO HAVE KIND OF THAT INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND AN CAN RECORD THAT AS WELL. ACCOUNTABILITY FOR MANAGERS ON THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE LEADERS SHOULD SHOULD FIND WAYS TO HOLD MANAGERS AND SUPERVISORS ACCOUNTABLE. WHAT WHAT IS MEASURED MATTERS WE ALL KNOW THAT AGAIN THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF TRAINING? AND CLIMATE SURVEYS FOCUS GROUPS. AND I'D I THINK THERE'S THERE AGAIN THERE'S SO MUCH GOOD THAT CAN BE DONE ON SEVERAL FRONTS BUT IMPROVING ALL OF THE COMPLIANCE PIECES. THAT ARE ALREADY DONE WELL AND MAKING THOSE BETTER AND THEN AGAIN THE LEADERSHIP IS JUST IT'S REALLY IT'S ALWAYS GOING TO COME BACK TO THE LEADERSHIP. AND IT'S IT'S JUST VERY EXCITING TO SEE. ALL OF YOU SO COMMITTED TO THAT. THANK YOU MS DAVIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN MADAM VICE CHAIR. AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY. I WILL GIVE YOU A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE I WAS ASKED TO DO THAT. AND IT WILL TOUCH ON PRINCIPLES PRACTICES DATA. AND AGAIN TOUCHING ON POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS HERE. I BOW TO THE WOMEN AND MEN IN THESE HALLS AND YOUNG. WHO HAVE STOOD UP AND SAID THIS IS ENOUGH? IT IS THEIR COURAGEOUS TRUTH TELLING THEIR CALL FOR ACCOUNTABILITY AND CORRECTIVE ACTION. AND THE ORGANIZING THAT HAVE SPURRED HISTORICAL RECKONING UNDER WAY HERE AND BEYOND. ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE COMMITTEE THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR ANSWERING THEIR CALL. MY NAME IS FINE YOU DAVIS I WAS BORN IN BIRMINGHAM ALABAMA DURING THE CIVIL RIGHTS ERA BECAUSE OF PERVASIVE RACIAL TERROR WE KNEW MY CITY AS BOMBING IN. THE MURDER OF TWO CLOSE CHILDHOOD FRIENDS IN THE NINETEEN SIXTY THREE SUNDAY SCHOOL BOMBING. CRYSTALLIZE WITHIN ME A PASSION FOR JUSTICE LEADING TO A LIFETIME OF ACTIVISM I ALSO BECAME A CIVIL RIGHTS TRIAL. LAWYER. AFTER ALMOST THREE DECADES OF ANGER REALLY FIGHTING INJUSTICE AS A TRIAL LAWYER AND ACTIVIST. I BECAME PHYSICALLY ILL. I INTUITED THAT TO RESTORE BALANCE I NEEDED TO BRING MORE HEALING ENERGIES INTO MY LIFE. AND SO I SHUT DOWN MY LAW PRACTICE AND ENROLLED IN A GRADUATE PROGRAM THAT ALLOWED ME TO TRAVEL TO AFRICA. ONLINE STUDY WITH HEALERS. AFTER RECEIVING MY PHD AN INDIGENOUS AND INDIGENOUS KNOWLEDGE I DISCOVERED RESTORATIVE JUSTICE KIND OF SYNCHRONISTIC LEE. IT IS THE JUSTICE THAT HE FEELS HARM INSTEAD OF REPLICATING IT. IT IS JUST AS THE REPAIRS DAMAGED RELATIONSHIPS INSTEAD OF SHATTERING THEM FURTHER AS A TRIAL LAWYER SAUL LOT OF EXAMPLES OF OF OF BAD RELATIONSHIPS BECOME EVEN WORSE WITH LITIGATION. EVER SINCE I DISCOVERED WAS SORT OF JUST AS I'VE BEEN WRITING TEACHING AND SPEAKING ABOUT IT. ALL OVER THE WORLD. I ALSO CO FOUNDED FOR AND FOR TEN YEARS DIRECTED. THE NATIONALLY ACCLAIMED NONPROFIT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR OAKLAND YOUTH. THAT'S OUR JOY HARJO AWAY. RJ WORKS WITH JUSTICE SYSTEM SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE NATION WE PROVIDE CONSULTATION TRAINING AND TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. REMOTE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE POLICIES AND PRACTICES. OUR SUCCESSES HAVE BEEN FEATURED ON PBS NPR AND IN THE NEW YORK TIMES CBS THE SMITHSONIAN STORYCORPS. AND ELSEWHERE. AFTER LAUNCHING PILOT PROGRAMS IN OAKLAND SCHOOLS OF THAT INCREASE ACADEMIC OUTCOMES WHILE DECREASING RACIAL DISPARITIES EXPLOSION SUSPENSIONS AND VIOLENCE. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ADOPTED RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AS OFFICIAL POLICY AND TODAY IT'S IN FORTY SCHOOLS. HAVE MORE THAN HALF OF THE SCHOOLS IN THE DISTRICT. ADDITIONALLY AMONG OTHER PROJECTS WE'VE JUST RECENTLY. BEGUN TO ENGAGE IN CONSULTATION AND FACILITATION. TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF SEXUAL HARM PARTICULARLY IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND A NATIONAL AND LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS. FULL DISCLOSURE THIS IS NOT BEEN A FOCUS OF MY PRACTICE OF ARDUOUS PRACTICE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE COMING TO. A MORE RECENTLY THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN MORE FOCUSED ON SEXUAL HARM AND I CAN. DEFINITELY REFER YOU TO THEM IF YOU'D LIKE. JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE ORIGINS OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IT FIRST AROSE IN ONTARIO CANADA IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES. AND THEN IN INDIANA AND THE U. S. SPEARHEADED BY THE MINUTE NIGHTS. OUT OF THE FRUSTRATION OF PERSONS HARM TO PERSONS CAUSING HARM COMMUNITIES. AND JUSTICE PROFESSIONALS WITH THE DYSFUNCTION OF OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM. INSPIRED BY INDIGENOUS VALUES RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS A PHILOSOPHY AND A THEORY OF JUSTICE. THAT EMPHASIZES BRINGING TOGETHER EVERYONE AFFECTED BY WRONGDOING TO COLLABORATIVELY COLLABORATIVELY ADDRESS NEEDS AND OBLIGATIONS AND TO HEAL THE HARM TO RELATIONSHIPS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WE PRIMARILY USE PEACEMAKING CIRCLES VICTIM OFFENDER MEDIATION PROCESSES RESTORATIVE COMMUNITY CONFERENCING. I AND IT'S APPLIED WE SORT OF JUSTICES APPLIED IN MULTIPLE CONTACTS SCHOOLS FAMILIES WORKPLACES THE JUSTICE SYSTEM. AND TO TRANSFORM LARGE SCALE HARM. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS A PROFOUNDLY RELATIONAL PRACTICE. RJ PIONEER HOW WOULD ZERO LINKS IT TO THE JUDEO CHRISTIAN CONCEPT OF SHALOM. EMPHASIZING RIGHT RELATIONSHIP. BETWEEN INDIVIDUALS BETWEEN GROUPS BETWEEN PEOPLE AND THE EARTH IN BETWEEN PEOPLE AND THE DIVINE. IN AFRICAN TRADITIONS RJ IS LINKED TO WHOM TO. I AM A HUMAN BEING THROUGH MY RELATIONSHIPS WITH OTHER HUMANS WITH ALL THE EARTH'S INHABITANTS. OUR ADVERSARIAL SYSTEM IS BASED UPON A ROMAN NOTION OF JUSTICE AS JUST DESSERTS. IF I CAUSE YOU TO SUFFER. THIS CREATES AN IMBALANCE IN THE SCALES OF JUSTICE AND THE ONLY WAY TO RE BALANCE THE SCALE. IS FOR ME TO SUFFER. WE RESPOND TO THE ORIGINAL HARM WITH A SECOND HARM ALWAYS IS A SYSTEM THAT HARMS PEOPLE WHO HARM PEOPLE. RECENTLY WHICH REASONABLY TO SHOW THAT HARMING PEOPLE IS WRONG. INSTEAD OF REPRODUCING HARM RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SEEKS TO REPAIR. THE HARM TO RELATIONSHIPS AFTER WRONGDOING. CRIMINAL JUSTICE HE'S CRIME IS BROKEN LAWS AND JUST AS THIS PUNISHMENT. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE SEES CRIME IS BROKEN LIVES AND RELATIONSHIPS. AND JUSTICE IS HEALING. MULTIPLE INTERNATIONAL STUDIES SUPPORT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS AFFECTED BY THIS. AND REDUCING RE OFFENDING AND TRANSFORMING PEOPLE AND RELATIONSHIPS. BOTH HARMED AND RESPONSIBLE PERSONS ARE MORE SATISFIED ACCORDING TO THE STUDIES RECEIVING BETTER OUTCOMES AND GREATER ACCOUNTABILITY. PERSONS HARMED ARE LESS LIKELY TO FEAR THE PERSON THAT HURT THEM AND LESS LIKELY TO FEAR THE POSSIBILITY OF RE VICTIMISATION THAN THOSE WHO GO THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE PROCESS. A RECENT REPORT ON OAKLAND'S. RESTORED THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. DOCUMENTS IN NEARLY FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION IN REOFFENDING COMPARED TO YOUNG PEOPLE GOING THROUGH THE TRADITIONAL OF JUVENILE LEGAL SYSTEM. A STUDY OF OAKLAND SCHOOL BASED RD PROGRAM SHOWS A FIFTY PERCENT REDUCTION. AND OUT OF SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT INCREASE IN TEST SCORES. SIXTY PERCENT INCREASE IN GRADUATION RATES. AND FIFTY SIX PERCENT REDUCTION IN DROPOUT. I'M A WITNESS. STUDENTS WERE FAILING RAISIN MULTIPLE INCARCERATIONS WHO WERE NOT EXPECTED TO GRADUATE NOT ONLY GRADUATE BUT SHE THREE UP POINT PLUS GPAS. GIRLS WHO A LONG TIME ENEMIES BECOME FRIENDS UP TO SITTING IN A PEACEMAKING CIRCLE INSTEAD OF FIGHTING STUDENTS COME INTO THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WHEN ASKED FOR A TALKING PEACE. AND A CIRCLE TO TALK THROUGH INSTEAD OF FIGHT THROUGH THEIR DIFFERENCES. YOUTH AND ADULTS WHO WALK INTO CIRCLE FEELING ANGER TOWARD ONE ANOTHER AND UP EMBRACING. I DON'T HAVE YOU SEEN ANY OF THE VIDEOS THAT YOU CAN FIND ONLINE YOUTUBE VIDEOS. ABOUT THESE PROCESSES IN THEM THE KIND OF MIRACULOUS. OUTCOMES. BUT THERE THERE ONE THAT I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS WHOLE MEETING WITH THE KILLER. WHERE FAMILY MEMBERS AND MEET WITH THE COLOR OF THEIR LOVED ONE MINE AND INCREDIBLE HEALING HAPPENS? SO POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS. IN THIS BODY. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT ANY LEGISLATIVE BODY IN THE U. S. HAS USE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. TO ADDRESS A SEXUAL HARM I SHOULD SAY I DON'T KNOW OF ANY. THAT SAID RESTORATIVE JUSTICE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENTED IN THE NUMBER OF WORKPLACES INCLUDING EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER LEARNING. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE TASK FORCE ON COLLEGE DUE PROCESS RIGHTS AND VICTIM PROTECTIONS. OF THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION ENCOURAGE THE USE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IN UNIVERSITIES TO ADDRESS TO ADDRESS SEXUAL HARASSMENT. HERE'S A CASE STUDY. ARE ACTUALLY OUT OF THE THIS COUNTRY IT'S IN CANADA IN DECEMBER TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WOMEN STUDENTS AT DOLL HOUSE THE UNIVERSITY'S DENTISTRY SCHOOL IN CANADA. IT'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT AFTER THEY LEARNED THEIR MALE CLASSMATES AT POSTED VULGAR MISOGYNISTIC SEXIST AND HOMOPHOBIC COMMENTS THAT TARGETED THEM SPECIFICALLY IN A PRIVATE FACEBOOK MEN'S ONLY GROUP. CULTURE AND CLIMATE ARE REFLECTED IN AND PERPETUATED BY THESE POSTS. THEY WERE REALLY OF JUST SO GRAPHIC. I REMEMBER ONE POST INVOLVED THE MEN ASKING FOR A POLL. OF. IN ANSWER THIS QUESTION OF WHO WOULD YOU LIKE TO HATE. F.. YEAH. AND THE RESPONSES TO THE POLLS. NAME CERTAIN WOMEN'S CERTAIN THOSE OF THE WOMEN WHO CAME FORWARD WHEN I FOUND OUT FROM A WHISTLEBLOWER. THE WOMEN CHOSE TO PROCEED THROUGH OVER AND RJ PROCESS OPTION AVAILABLE UNDER DOLL HOUSE UNIVERSITY SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY. TWELVE OF THE THIRTEEN MEMBERS OF THE MAIL FACEBOOK GROUP PARTICIPATED IN THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROCESS. THE DENTAL SCHOOL AND THE ENTIRE UNIVERSITY ALSO PARTICIPATED IN RESPECT TO CULTURE AND CLIMATE CLAIMS. THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROCESS. LASTED FIVE MONTHS VERY BY NOT SIMPLE YOU KNOW THEY TAKE A LONG TIME. ARE THERE NOT QUICK FIXES. SUSTAINABLE FIXES USUALLY. COMPLAINTS WERE HANDLE TO THE SATISFACTION OF THE PARTICIPANTS AND THE UNIVERSITY THE ACADEMIC STANDARDS COMMITTEE IT'S LIKE THEIR RULES COMMITTEE OR THE STUDENT CONDUCT COMMITTEE. CONCLUDED THAT THE YOUNG MEN SUCCESSFULLY REMEDIATED THEIR BEHAVIOR ALL THROUGH COMPLETION OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROCESS AND THEREFORE THEY WOULD NOT BE EXPELLED. THEY HAD TO FURTHER DECISION ADULT TO COMPLETE THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROCESS. THE CHALLENGES WERE ENORMOUS ESPECIALLY EXCEPTIONAL LEVEL OF PUBLIC AND MEDIA ATTENTION. MUCH BASED ON LOUD OUTCRIES FOR PUNISHMENT. HOWEVER I ALSO BELIEVE THIS WAS A GAME CHANGER IN MODELER RESTORATIVE INTERVENTION TO TRANSFORM HARM. AS WELL AS TO THE ONGOING WORK OF BUILDING RESPECTFUL AND INCLUSIVE RELATIONSHIPS TO CREATE A HEALTHIER CULTURE AND CLIMATE. DURING THIS PERIOD THE PARTICIPANTS ENGAGED IN MULTIPLE EDUCATION SESSIONS DEALING WITH DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION GENDER BASED DISCRIMINATION. BUILDING SUPPORTIVE COMMUNITIES CONFLICT RESOLUTION HUMAN RIGHTS. IMPLICIT BIAS AND OTHER TOPICS THE MALE STUDENTS ENGAGED IN FURTHER RESEARCH TO PREPARE FOR PRESENTATIONS BEFORE THE ENTIRE SCHOOL. OF ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD DONE ABOUT WHAT THEY HAD LEARNED FROM WHAT THEY HAD DONE. ALL OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS GROUP THAT I THINK THERE WERE ABOUT ONE T. SOMETHING FACILITATED SCHOOL WIDE CIRCLES TO EXPLORE STRATEGIES FOR CULTURE AND CLIMATE CHANGE. I HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BEING AN AMOUNT OF SCOTIA HALIFAX AND FUNNIER AND A HALF AGO. AND THERE WAS A PRESENTATION MADE BY THESE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN I WAS NEVER SO PROUD THERE WERE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE OF THEM IN. WE'LL JUST WITH TEARFUL LISTENING OF TWO OF THE ACCOUNT OF THE EXPERIENCE. LET ME JUST GIVE YOU A FEW QUOTESWOMEN PARTICIPANTS SAID AND I QUOTE. FOR US. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WAS A SOLUTION TO A COMPLICATED PROBLEM WE'RE SMALL CLASS FROM A SMALL SCHOOL AND WE'RE TIGHT KNIT COMMUNITY. AS A RESULT WE HAD COME TO CARE DEEPLY ABOUT EACH OTHER AS CLASSMATES AND HIS FRIENDS. IT WAS THIS CARING THAT MADE THE REALIZATION OF THE FACEBOOK REPEL CONTENT ABOUT US SO UPSETTING. RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROVIDED US WITH A DIFFERENT SORT OF JUSTICE. THEN THE PUTATIVE TYPE MOST OF THE LOUDEST PUBLIC VOICES SEEM TO WHAT WE WERE CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING WE WERE NOT LOOKING TO HAVE OUR CLASSMATES EXPELLED. AS THIRTEEN ANGRY MEN WANT US TO KNOW MORE THAN THEY DID THE DAY THE POSTS WERE UNCOVERED. THAT'S NOT ACOUNTABILITY. NOR DO WE WANT SIMPLY TO FORGIVE AND FORGET. RATHER WE WERE LOOKING FOR A RESOLUTION THAT WILL ALLOW US TO GRADUATE ALONGSIDE MEN WHO UNDERSTOOD THE HARMS THE CAUSE. OWN THESE HARMS AND WOULD CARRY WITH THEM A RESPONSIBILITY AND OBLIGATION TO DO BETTER. AND THIS IS WHAT THE MEN AND THE WOMEN SAID FOR ALL OF US THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PROCESS CREATED SPACE TO HAVE THE DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS WE NEEDED TO LEARN FROM OUR MISTAKES AND EXPERIENCES. IT HAS HELPED US DEVELOP OUR ABILITIES TO REFLECT CRITICALLY COMMUNICATE AND RESOLVE PROBLEMS AND CONFLICTS. WE'RE OW MORE AWARE OF OUR ACTIONS AND THEIR IMPACTS ON OTHERS WE HAVE GROWN AS PEOPLE. OF GAINING A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING AND COMMITMENT TO THE IMPORTANCE OF ACTING WITH RESPECT. TRUST INTEGRITY EQUALITY AND ACCEPTANCE. FACEBOOK POSTS HAVE SHAPED OUR STORY BUT WE WILL NOT LET THEM BE OUR ONLY LEGACY. WE COMMIT TO USING WE COMMIT TO USING AND SHARING WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED FOR THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS. TO CONTRIBUTE BACK TO THE COMMUNITIES WE HOPE TO SERVE ONE DAY AS DENNIS. ALSO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN EXPLORING ALREADY OPTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE. THAT YOU LOOK AT THIS REPORT THE FULL REPORT CAN BE FOUND ONLINE. AND VERY BRIEFLY ON RECOMMENDATIONS. I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME WOMEN OF LEGISLATURE LIKE THE WOMEN A DOLL HOUSE UNIVERSITY ARE INTERESTED IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OPTIONS. THE LEGISLATURE COULD EXPLORE MAKING AVAILABLE SUCH AN OPTION FOR PERSONS HARMED ALBEIT IN CASES THAT ARE. NOT AGGRAVATED NOT SEVERE OF BEHAVIOR THAT COMPRISE THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE CLAIMS IS AMY OPPENHEIMER NOTES. THIS THIS IS RECOMMENDED THIS OPTION IS RECOMMENDED BY THE AMERICAN BAR ASSOCIATION TASK FORCE AND IS MODELED BY DOLL HOUSE THE UNIVERSITY'S SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY. AND THIS WILL ALSO. PROVIDE A SPACE WHERE PERSONS WHO HAVE A NEED TO FEEL HURT. MAY BE HEARD. SOMEONE TALKED ABOUT THAT EARLIER. ADDITIONALLY TO BEGIN TO TRANSFORM ITS CULTURE OF SEXUAL AND GENDER BASED VIOLENCE. OF THE. OF WHICH IS THAT YOU COULD OFFER TRAINING TO LAWMAKERS AND STAFF MEMBERS AND FACILITATING RESTORATIVE JUSTICE CIRCLES. ARE THEY COULD USE THESE PROCESSES TO ENGAGE MEMBERS AND THE STAFF. OF IN DEVELOPING SHARED VALUES ENGAGING IN DEEP EXPLORATION OF WHAT RESPECT INSTABILITY IN THE WORKPLACE REQUIRES OF EACH OF US. WHAT IS HEALTHY MASCULINITY WHAT ARE HEALTHY RELATIONSHIPS AND WHAT A HEALTHY COMMUNITIES A WHAT IS SAFETY IN THE WORKPLACE LOOK LIKE FOR US HERE? IN THE CAPITAL OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION ABUSE OF POWER POWER DIFFERENT ALL OF THESE TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED AND AND. AND POLICIES PERHAPS OR SUGGESTIONS WERE POLICIES CAN COME OUT OF THOSE CIRCLES. ME JUST GIVE YOU REALLY BE STORY ABOUT BULLYING AND A AND A HIGH SCHOOL I BELIEVE IT OR MAYBE WAS A MIDDLE SCHOOL. A MIDDLE SCHOOL IS HAVING A HUGE PROBLEM WITH BELIEVING THEY BROUGHT IN VERY EXPENSIVE CONSULTANTS WHO CREATED BEAUTIFUL SHINY POSTERS TO ALL DOWN THE HALLWAYS AND BROCHURES. DID ANYTHING CHANGE NO. SO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE PERSON CAME IN AND SAID WELL WHY DON'T WE. HAVE THE STUDENTS. AWAY IN ON THIS ONE WE DO A CIRCLE WITH THEM SO THEY CAN TALK ABOUT BULLYING YOU KNOW HOW IT MAKES THEM FEEL. HOW IT HOW IT IMPACTS THE WHOLE SCHOOL? AND WHAT THEY CAN DO. AND WHAT THE SCHOOL CAN DO TO CHANGE IT. THEY DID A COUPLE OF CIRCLES AND CAME UP WITH A PLAN. BULLYING ALMOST STOPPED COMPLETELY AS A RESULT. SO I GUESS IT'S A PLEA FOR WORKING ALONE WITH A SACK MEMBERS AND LAWMAKERS SO WE'RE HAVING THEM WORK TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY. OF TO COME UP WITH IDEAS ABOUT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO CREATE A MORE. HEALTHY AND RESPECTFUL WORKPLACE. THIS LEGISLATIVE BODY IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO BECOME A MODEL FOR THE REST OF THE COUNTRY. AND TRANSFORMING SEXUAL HARM IN POLITICS THANK YOU. THANK YOU BOTH. RATHER EXCELLENT PANEL WITH. VERY IMPORTANT INFORMATION AND SUGGESTIONS EVERQUEST COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR MS DAVIS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SO. THE COUPLE QUESTIONS FIRST SO IS YOUR SUGGESTION THAT RATHER THAN WAIT FOR THE FUTURE. ALLEGATIONS ARE INVESTIGATIONS THAT IF WE WERE INTERESTED IN WERE SORT OF JUST AS WE WOULD SORT OF START NOW. AND SIT DOWN WITH. GROUPS OF PEOPLE OR INCORPORATED INTO OUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING. A COMBINATION OR KIND OF HOW WOULD YOU ENVISION THAT HAPPENING GIVEN THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THE NUMBER OF MEMBERS. OF THAT SORT OF THING. YES SO IN A SORT OF JUST AS WE DON'T JUST DO THESE CIRCLES AFTER HARM HAS OCCURRED. OF IN FACT IN SCHOOLS WHEN WE DO WE SORT OF JUST AS WE. RECOMMEND THAT THERE ARE MORE COMMUNITY BUILDING TRUST BUILDING A CIRCLE SEVENTY PERCENT OF THOSE. VERSUS THIRTY PERCENT OF CONFLICTS OF LAWS SO YOU COULD START DOING THESE COMMUNITY BUILDING CIRCLES HE'S FIRST BUILDING SO WHAT DOES IT MEAN WHAT IS IT OF. RESPECTFUL AND CIVIL WORKPLACE LOOK LIKE IN HERE FROM EMPLOYEES ALL AND THEY WOULD COME UP WITH PLANS POSSIBLY BUT TO DO THAT YOU WE COULD TRAIN. OF PEOPLE TO FACILITATE THOSE CIRCLES YOU COULD BECAUSE I MEAN HOW MANY EMPLOYEES ARE HERE. THE WHOLE CAP. IN ALL CAPS. TOTAL TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED TOTAL STATEWIDE. SO YOU WON'T NEED A LOT OF FACILITATORS FOR THE CIRCLES BE HAPPENING. ALL OVER IT ON THE IS THE THAT BOTH BODIES. ARE SO TRAINING. WE COULD DO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TRAINING YOU COULD ADD AS A COMPONENT OF YOUR SEXUAL HARASSMENT TRAINING. PROBABLY BETTER DID USED TO JUST DO A ONE OF DEDICATED ONE OR TWO DAYS RESTORATIVE JUSTICE TRAINING. CENTER TO TEACH PEOPLE NOT NECESSARILY TO. FACILITATE THE MORE COMPLICATED HARM AND CONFLICTS CIRCLES BUT TO FACILITATE THE COMMUNITY BUILDING CIRCLES WHERE THEY WOULD BE VERY DEEP DISCUSIONS. AND THE AND THE THE POWER OF THESE CIRCLES IS SOMETHING THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME. TO CONVEY OUR THERE ARE VIDEOS ONLINE THAT YOU CAN FIND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR OAKLAND USED HAS A COUPLE OF VIDEOS AND YOU GET A BETTER BETTER EXAMPLE. A BETTER SENSE OF HOW POWERFUL THESE CIRCLES ARE IN TERMS OF CREATING A SPACE WHERE PEOPLE FEEL SAFE TO SPEAK THEIR TRUTH. ARM AND IN WAYS THAT DON'T CAUSE FURTHER HARM. OF. AND. CREATING SPACES USING THE TALKING PIECE INTO THE FOR EXAMPLE TALKING PEACE. IF I'M HOLDING IT THAT MEANS THAT I'M THE ONLY PERSON TALKING I'M TALKING WITH RESPECT AND FROM THE HEART. EVERYBODY ELSE IS LISTENING WITH RESPECT AND FROM THE HEART NO CROSS TALKING. THIS IS AN AMAZING. ATMOSPHERE OF RESPECT. AND DEEP LISTENING AND DEEP TALKING. OFTEN THERE'S A LOT OF EMOTION. YOU KNOW USUALLY TEARS WE SENT A SORT OF DOSES OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECE OF PAPER IS THE KLEENEX. ANDAND OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE OF COURSE WE AVE. FILES ABOUT MOUNTAINS OF PAPER OF SO. IF THESE CIRCLES A WELL FACILITATED IT'S JUST AMAZING TRANSFORMATION CAN OCCUR. AND THESE ARE THE KIND OF CIRCLES THAT YOU CAN ACTUALLY START DOING NOW. SO I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN EXPLORING WITH YOU FURTHER IN A SORT OF OFF LINE. DIFFERENT SCENARIOS OF HOW WE COULD DO THAT I DON'T THINK IT'S. YOU KNOW WE SHOULDN'T BE. PROBABLY SHOULDN'T TAKE TIME. THINKING ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I'M SURE THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT WAYS THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN BUT I'M INTERESTED IN EXPLORING THAT. DEFINITELY SO WHEN YOU WHEN YOU HAVE THE MORE RESPONSIVE TYPE OF RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THAT HAPPENS AFTER THERE'S BEEN AN INCIDENT. IS A TYPICAL THAT THEY WILL BE UP TO THE VICTIM TO DECIDE IF THEY WANT TO SORT OF THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE COME JUSTICE COMPONENT OR A MORE TRDITIONAL KIND OF PUNISHMENT BASED STORE. PENALTY BASED APPROACH YEAH IT'S YOU IN USUALLY FOLLOWS THE THE. DESIRES OF THE VICTIMS UPS IS A VICTIM CENTERED PROCESS. YET. OKAY AND THEN. OF YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU YOU SAID SOMETHING ABOUT USING THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE FOR THE LESS SERIOUS OFFENSES ARE YOU ENVISIONING A SITUATION WHERE THERE BE. SOME CASES THAT CROSS THE LINE TO WHERE YOU WOULDN'T WANT THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OPTION WHERE YOU WOULD SAY YOU KNOW REALLY THE PERSON SHOULD BE EXPELLED OR FIRED OR DO YOU THINK THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE USED FOR EVERYTHING THAT'S NOT THE LEVEL OF MAYBE CRIMINAL. THE MORE THE LATTER MORE THE LATTER. IN SCHOOLS FOR EXAMPLE I I DON'T I THINK IT'S JUST REALLY REALLY HARMFUL TO EXPEL. IF IT'S CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR YOU DON'T REALLY HAVE YOU HAD IT YOU DON'T USE TEXANS ARE WASTED. TO RESOLVE THE DISPUTE UNLESS THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM HAS RESTORED DOESN'T RIGHT NOW I'M JUST SAYING THAT IT IS A DAY WOULD YOU DO YOU FEEL THAT THERE ARE SOME LINES I'M SAYING YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SOMETHING THAT'S CRIMINAL. WE SEND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM BUT IF IF THERE ARE THINGS THAT FALL BELOW THAT BUT ABOVE A CERTAIN THRESHOLD TO WORRY YOU WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. IN THIS CASE. THE ASSEMBLY SHOULD FIRE THE PERSON OR THE MEMBER SHOULD BE EXPELLED OR DO YOU THINK THAT YOU ENVISION WHERE THIS COULD BE USED FOR ANY NON CRIMINAL. SEXUAL HARASSMENT. ALLEGATIONS ONCE IT. AND IF THE PERSON CAUSING HARM I DON'T LIKE IT BUT WE'LL BE BACK UP I DON'T REALLY USE THE WORD VICTIM. USUALLY SAY THE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN HARMED AND IF YOU WANT ME TO EXPLAIN WHY I CAN TALK ABOUT THAT BUT. IF THE PERSON WHO HAS BEEN HARMED ONCE IT AND THE PERSON WHO WAS BECAUSE THE HARM. AGREES TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY WE CANNOT HAVE A CIRCLE OF WITH A PERSON WHO DIDN'T WASN'T TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. ONLY TO READ HARM AND RE RE VICTIMIZED THE THE PERSON I'M SO. YES. ANY ANY OF THE OFFENSE A SHORT OF A CRIMINAL ONE. HOUR WHERE THE VICTIM OR THE PERSON WHO IS HARMED A ONCE IT AND THE PERSON WAS BECAUSE THE HORN. A TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR IT. AND IF WE WERE TO MAKE THIS PART OF OUR TRAINING THESE CIRCLES. WOULD BE SOMETHING THAT. TYPICALLY EVERYONE'S REQUIRED TO ATTEND OR IS IT. IF YOU WANT TO OTHERWISE YOU CAN JUST DO THE OTHER TRAINER TO BECOME YOUR PART OF YOUR TRAINING THAT EVERYBODY'S RESPONSIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN. IT'S YOUR CHOICE OF BUT I IT WE SAY IN OUR SORT OF JUST AS THERE'S NO CORROSION WE REALLY TRY TO AVOID COERCION. OF. SO BUT IT'S IT'S YOUR CHOICE. THANK YOU WITHOUT ALL GO TO THE PANEL FOR ANY QUESTIONS. I'M ASSUMING NUMBER IS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION SINCERELY APPRECIATED THAT. MS DAVIS ONE OF YOUR YOUR ORGANIZATION OUR JOY. THE. STANCE FOR OAKLAND YOUTH RIGHT YES AND SOMETIMES WHAT WE KEEP SAYING WE WANT TO CHANGE IT TO OUR YOUTH BECAUSE WE I WAS GOING TO SAY THAT. I THINK THAT IT'S A PROGRAM THAT I THINK IF IF IT'S OUR YOUTH THEN IT COULD BE USED FOR. ALL OF OUR YOU. JUST NEED TO SPEND THE MONEY TO PAY FOR OF FOR ALL OF US NEED IT. IT'S CLEAR THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE TWO. THINGS. THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT THE SHADOW OF THE LEADER AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT IN MY NOTES I HAD NOTED THAT OFTEN TIMES TO TALK ABOUT MANAGERS AND SOMEONE WHO MANAGES THE SITUATION SOMEONE WHO MANAGES THE PEOPLE. BUT WE REALLY NEED LEADERS. WE NEED LEADERS WHO IN THE SHADOW OF THAT LEADER THAT SETS THE TONE FOR THE REST OF THE STAFF THE SETS A TONE. FOR THE REST OF THE EMPLOYEES OF COULD YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT SPECIFICALLY ABOUT THE NEED OR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LEADER AND A MANAGER. I THINK THAT LEADERS IS A MUCH BROADER CONCEPT. OF I THINK CERTAINLY THE MEMBERS ARE ALL LEADERS I'M MANAGERS I HOPE. OUR LEADERS YOUR BEST MANAGERS CERTAINLY OUR LEADERS AND THEN I THINK THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE TITLES NECESSARILY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ANY OFFICIAL SUPERVISORY AUTHORITY BUT THEY TOO ARE LEADERS. TO THINK LEADERS IS A VERY BROAD CONCEPT I TALKED ABOUT PEOPLE WHO. ARE. PEOPLE FOLLOW THEM PEOPLE LOOK UP TO THEM. MAYBE MENTORS. THOSE ARE LEADERS SO I THINK LEADER IS A VERY. INCLUSIVE CATEGORY TO THEIR THE OFFICIAL LEADERS IN THE UNOFFICIAL LEADERS AND NOT SO I'M REFERRING TO AND THEY ALL CAST A SHADOW. AND HOPEFULLY OF THE SHADOWS A POSITIVE ONE AND HOPEFULLY THEY'RE ALL IN THE SAME DIRECTION. AND YOU ALL HAVE AGREEMENT ABOUT THE CULTURE YOU WANT TO CREATE. WONDERFUL IT WAS INTERESTING. THIS MORNING I WAS IN A BIBLE STUDY AND IT HAD TO DO WITH PUTTING. BRINGING THINGS TO LIGHT ONE WICKED THINGS ARE DONE IN DARKNESS THEY REMAIN IN DARKNESS AND WHEN YOU PUT SHED LIGHT ON IT I THINK THE CIRCLE. OF SHEDS LIGHT ON. THE THE BAD BEHAVIOR BUT ALSO RESTORING IT TO THE HARM THAT DOES HAPPEN TO THE PERSON PASSED RESTORING THAT AS WELL. I THANK YOU SO MUCH BOTH OF YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU. SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH OF YOU. I WAS LISTENING TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND AND. AND. YOU COULDN'T SEE ME I HOPE SHAKING MY HEAD. BECAUSE RECOGNIZING THAT. AS WE'VE TALKED KIND OF AN ABSTRACT ABOUT CULTURE CHANGE SOME PEOPLE OF STRUGGLE BECAUSE IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT. WHITE CULTURE WITH WITH IS IT WOULD IT LOOK LIKE HOW I KNOW ONE AND IT'S CHANGED. AND RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS THIS IS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE A TRUE CULTURE SHIFT AND SO WE COULDN'T BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE WOULD MANDATE IT ADMIT IT REQUIRES BY IAN. YOU KNOW FOR IT TO WORK. I'M INTRIGUED BY HAD GIVEN THE CULTURE OF THE LEGISLATURE GIVEN YOU KNOW. ROOMS IN SITUATIONS IN CONVERSATIONS I'VE BEEN A AND I WAS SITTING HERE AND THINKING BACK ABOUT. I WONDER IF WE WOULD HAVE A BODY AND IN THIS SPACE IN PLACE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE TALK ABOUT IT IN THIS HEARING AND WE BEGIN TO AIR IT. AS AN OPTION FOR US. WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY SIX SEVEN YEARS AGO ASSEMBLYWOMAN WILMER CARTER FROM. THE INLAND EMPIRE ALMOST THE FIRST AS I RECALL IN THIS LEGISLATIVE ARENA TO TALK ABOUT IT IN TERMS OF LEGISLATING FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BUT TO THINK ABOUT AS THE CONCEPT OF SELF GOVERNANCE I WAS FASCINATED BY AND HOPE. THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT IT AS WE HAVE IMPLICIT BIAS. AND FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THE NEED FOR US AS. A CAPITAL COMMUNITY TO BE AWARE OF OUR OWN BIASES. IN THIS CONTEXT OF THIS COMMITTEE WE'VE TALKED WE'VE WE'VE HAD LINEAR CONVERSATIONS. LEGISLATORS WHO HAVE POWER OVER STAFF. SUPERSTAR HARASSER WHO CAN BE STAFF YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A TERM LIMIT ENVIRONMENT AND STAFF WHO HAVE A LOT LONGER TEN YEARS DIDN'T MEMBERS WHO. CAN BEHAVE IN A DISRESPECTFUL WAY THE OTHER WAY AND SO IT'S NOT LINEAR IT GOES UP AND DOWN IN IT AND CROSSWAYS. ANSEL FIGURED OUT HOW WE DEVELOP A SYSTEM TO ADDRESS ALL OF THESE VIOLATIONS OF POWER I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT. THE EXAMPLE YOU GAVE FOR THE SHADOW OF A LEADER. AND. AS I HAD A SIDE BAR WITH MY COLLEAGUE ON THAT ONLY DID. THE LEADER OR NOT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO STAND. AND CHECKED THE BEHAVIOR IN REAL TIME AS YOU WE AS PARENTS UNDERSTAND YOU DON'T WAIT TO GET HOME FROM TARGET WHEN THE BIG HATE WHEN YOU FILL OUT BY ALL. AND HAVE A TEMPER TANTRUM TARGET WHY DON'T WAIT TILL I GET HOME WE HAVE THE CONVERSATION I LEVEL RIGHT THERE ON THE ISLAND TARGET ABOUT WHY YOUR BEHAVIOR IS INAPPROPRIATE. THAT DOESN'T IN THE MOMENT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE. AS WE GET OLDER. AND AND THEN YOU HAVE TO WONDER IF HE IS REPRIMAND OF OF THE MEMBERS WOULD HAVE OCCURRED IF THE VICTIM HAD EXPRESSED THE CONCERN AT ALL. ALL RIGHT I MEAN THERE WAS AN OUTCRY RIGHT ANSWER RIGHT YEAH EXACTLY WAS PEOPLE WENT CRAZY EXACTLY. AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO IS THE LEADER WHAT LEADERSHIP LOOKS LIKE BECAUSE THE WHOLE NOTION OF BYSTANDER TRAINING. EVERYONE UNDERSTANDS THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO OUR FELLOW. MAN ARE ONE MAN. TO STEP UP. AND ADDRESS HARMON OFFENSE AND SO YOU KNOW MY THOUGHT WAS ANY ONE IN THAT ROOM. COULD HAVE TAKEN A STAND DIDN'T JUST HAVE TO BE THE SPEAKER RIGHT ANY ONE IN THAT ROOM COULD HAVE STOOD UP WALKED OUT. WALKED OVER TO THE THE PERSON WHO WAS THE RECIPIENT OF THE HARM AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT LEADERSHIP IT'S NOT JUST THE TITLE. AND WE DON'T OFTEN AVE TO WAIT ON LEADERS TO DO THE RIGHT THING. THAT ANYBODY IN THAT ROOM COULD HAVE TAKEN OF ACTION. THAT COULD HAVE CHANGED THE WHOLE ENERGY IN DYNAMIC AND IN ALL OF US ALL IN UNDERSTAND THAT. THE. THANK YOU. Q. TOM AND I YOU KNOW I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS THAT I AM I PREPARED FROM IS WISE BUT IT'S VERY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S ALMOST HARD TO ASK THEM GIVEN. THE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. APPROACH TO THIS IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE APPROACH THAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW. OF SORT OF INVESTIGATING AND THEN YOU KNOW DETERMINING SOME KIND OF PENALTY OR COUNSELING OR WHATEVER IT IS SO. AFTER HEARING. HEARING ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S SORT OF INTERESTING TO TO KIND OF READ BACK THESE QUESTIONS THAT I PREPARED AND. AND HOW DIFFERENTLY YOU WOULD EACH ANSWER THEM SO I'LL ASK THEM AND BOTH OF YOU CAN CERTAINLY. RESPOND. FIRST IS WHETHER IT IS ACCEPTABLE TO GIVE A COMPLAINT IN THE OPTION IN THE COMPLAINT AND THE OPTION OF CONFRONTING THE HARASSER. WHAT DO YOU THINK IN THE TRADITIONAL MODEL AND I CERTAINLY WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR AGAIN THEY WERE SORT OF JUSTICE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT? IS TO HAVE THAT INTERACTION BUT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW GIVEN MORE TYPICAL PROCESS WHAT WOULD YOU THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. RIGHT ACTUALLY IN THAT THAT'S CAN BE USED AS AN ASSESSMENT TOOL AS WELL BY A GOOD. INVESTIGATOR YOU MIGHT ASK IS PART OF KIND OF THE INTAKE PROCESS. YOU MIGHT ASK IF THE PERSON HAS CONFRONTED THE PERSON THEY'RE ACCUSING WHICH GIVES YOU KIND OF A SENSE OF HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT IT HOW THEY'RE KIND OF. EXPERIENCING THE SITUATION. THEY COULD THERE THEY CAN HAVE EXTREME REACTIONS THEY CAN SAY ON THE ONE HAND NO I I ABSOLUTELY COULD NOT. OR FIRED BY WHAT'S HAPPENING. THEY COULD SAY WELL YES I HAVE I'VE DONE THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND I'M GETTING TO WORK KIND OF GIVES YOU A SENSE OF PLACE. FOR WHERE THEY ARE. SOMETIMES. I THINK WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS OFTEN BASED ON THIS UNDERSTANDING RIGHT SO SOMETHING THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE A FULL BLOWN INVESTIGATION WHERE IF THE PARTIES ARE AMENABLE ON. WHAT YOUHAVE TO MAKE CLEAR FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT IS THAT IS NEVER EVER THE COMPLAINING PARTY IS RESPONSIBILITY TO IN ANY WAY CONFRONT THE PERSON THAT THEY'RE ACCUSING? SO WHETHER IT'S THROUGH RESTORATIVE JUSTICE WHICH MIGHT HAVE SOME APPEAL WHICH YOU CAN BE VERY EMPOWERING FOR THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCUSING. FROM A LEGAL STANDPOINT WE CAN NEVER EVER REQUIRE THE PERSON TO CONFRONT THEM BOMB DIRECTLY SO THAT HAS TO BE MADE VERY VERY CLEAR AND THEN ONCE THAT'S VERY CLEAR TO THEM IT'S HELPFUL TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE FEELING ABOUT THAT WHETHER THEY'VE DONE THAT AT ALL. I'M I'M CERTAINLY MORE CONCERNED IF THEY HAVE TOLD THE PERSON SEVERAL TIMES THE BEHAVIOR IS OFFENSIVE TO ME RIGHT AND THE PERSON HAS DISREGARDED THAT I'M ALREADY GOING TO TAKE IT MORE SERIOUSLY. IF THEY'RE UNWILLING TO DO THAT I WANT TO KNOW THAT TOO. I'M A MAN SO IT'S IT'S JUST HELPFUL. IN STARTING WHATEVER THE PROCESS IS GOING TO BE AND THEN IF THEY'RE OPEN TO IT AND IF WE'VE GOT PEOPLE WHO ARE TRAINED IN RESTORATIVE JUSTICE THAT'S. ANOTHER OPTION THAT WE CAN CONSIDER SO I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU HAVE TO DIE I CERTAINLY DON'T THINK YOU WOULD EVER CHOOSE TO GO ALL ONE WAY OR ANOTHER IT WOULD BE WONDERFUL I THINK TO HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE TRYING TO DO RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AND THAT. THAT COULD BE AN OPTION FOR PEOPLE IN THAT SITUATION BUT YOU CAN NEVER FORCE THAT AND AND YOU WOULDN'T WANT TO ANYWAY BECAUSE THAT'S NOT PART OF THE PROCESS. WHAT WOULD IT BE A WONDERFUL OPTION TO HAVE I PERSONALLY AM THE MENTION VERY EXCITED TO THINK ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE AS AN OPTION? MOM BUT YOU COULD NEVER REQUIRED THAT. OUR CURRENT SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICY PERMITS EITHER THE COMPLAINT NOR THE RESPONDENT TO APPEAL THE DECISION DO YOU THINK THAT'S THE BEST PRACTICE NO NO NO. I KNOW I DON'T I FEEL THAT THAT IS. I BACKING UP. WHEN YOU HAVE AN AGAIN I AM THE INTERNAL INVESTIGATOR LET'S SAY WHO IS WELL TRAINED. WHO'S GETTING TRAINING ONTINUALLY THEY NEED TO THEY MUST THEIR DUTY YOUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO CONDUCT THAT PROMPT IMPARTIAL THOROUGH. OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION OF THE THE LAST PANEL I I'M JUST SAYING WHAT THEY SAID RIGHT THAT'S THEY THEY. THEY WILL OUTLINED IT OTHERS NO REASON TO REPEAT WHAT THEY SAID WAS EXCELLENT SO YOU YOU WANT THE INVESTIGATION TO PROCEED THAT WAY IF THEY'VE DONE THAT ONCE THEY FINISHED. THAT'S THE RESULT. I THINK IT IT WOULD TAKE AWAY ANY AUTHORITY ANY. YOU'D BE QUESTIONING THEIR PROCESS THEIR PROCEDURE THEIR ABILITY TO CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO SAY I APPEAL BECAUSE WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS I DON'T AGREE WITH THE RESULT. SO YOU'VE JUST SAID THAT ENTIRE PROCESS ALL THE EFFORT THAT YOU PUT INTO THAT ALL THE RESOURCES. YOU WE JUST WANT TO DISREGARD THAT BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE RESULTS THAT'S ALL THAT'S HAPPENING. AND AGAIN THERE'S NO THEY HAVE NO RIGHT OF APPEAL UNLESS YOU GIVE THAT TO THEM. AND I I JUST THINK THAT WOULD BE A. MIS USE OF RESOURCES AND IT REALLY JUST CALLS INTO QUESTION EVERYTHING THAT THEY'VE DONE RIGHT AND WE DO DO THAT NOW. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. IS A FOLLOW UP ON THAT THOSE WHO. THE PEOPLE THAT WE EMPLOY THOSE TO DO THE INVESTIGATIONS ARE PAID BY THE STATE AND SO IF YOU HAVE. THE INVESTIGATION THAT COMES OUT IN A IN A MANNER THAT TOM. IS IT SATISFACTORY TO WHO'S BEING ACCUSED AND THEY THEY SAY THERE COULD BE A BIAS THERE HOW DO YOU KEEP THAT FROM BEING A BIAS WHEN YOU HAVE. THE THE. PARTY THIS BEING EMPLOYED. IS EMPLOYED BY THE STATE WILL EVERYONE'S EMPLOYED RATE THE PERSON WHOSE ACCUSING IS IT EMPLOYED BY THE STATE AS WELL. AND THE PERSON WHO IS ACCUSED. IS EMPLOYED BY THE STATE SO EVERYONE IS WITH AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATOR AND THAT'S PART OF. THE GOOD INVESTIGATION I MEAN THEY THEY HAVE TO BE MINDFUL AND AGAIN I THINK AS THE PANEL FRIENDSHIP OR RELATIONSHIP. THAN THAT PERSON THEY CAN'T DO THE INVESTIGATION SO DEPENDING ON HOW MANY PEOPLE YOU HAVE WHO ARE WELL TRAINED IN INVESTIGATION. IT'S EITHER SIGN TO ANOTHER INVESTIGATOR OR YOU YOU WOULD HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE IF YOU DON'T-HAVE OTHERS INTERNALLY BUT THAT MEANS RECOGNIZING THAT BIAS. IF YOU'VE GOT SAY WILL ONLY ONE PERSON AND THEN THEY HAVE A RELATIONSHIP WITH ONE OF THE PARTIES. THEY HAVE TO REPORT THAT AND THEY CAN'T DO THE INVESTIGATION AND AND THE BIAS MIGHT BE IN THE VICTIM MAY BE UNHAPPY WITH THE RESULT. MEAN THEY COULD WELL BE THE ONE SAYING NO I WANT TO FEEL BECAUSE I DON'T LIKE THE RESULTS SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS THE PERSON WHO'S GOT. IT GOES EITHER WAY RIGHT RIGHT BUT NO I'M SAYING DON'T DO THAT YOU'RE SAYING I DON'T LIKE YOU KNOW ACROSS PROCESS BY EITHER SIDE. RIGHT NOT IF YOU'VE GOT WELL TRAINED INVESTIGATORS THAT COULD THAT'S JUST DOING IT AGAIN. AND THEN AND THEN. AND THEN WHY WOULDN'T YOU JUST ALLOW ANOTHER APPEAL. IF IT COMES OUT THE OTHER WAY. SO I. DISAGREE WITH YOU WE ARE POLICIES ARE NOT IN LINE WITH THAT THOUGHT PROCESS RIGHT AND RIGHT AND I I WOULD ECHO WHAT THE PANEL SAID AS WELL I DON'T ZERO TOLERANCE. WHAT I JUST WANNA MAKE ONE MORE POINT ABOUT THE ZERO TOLERANCE AND I'M SPEAKING OUT OF TURN I KNOW BECAUSE NO ONE ASKED? THAT WAS MY NEXT QUESTION SO YOU'RE PERFECTLY UNDER ON TOPIC GREAT THANK YOU I AM DIED THE OTHER PANEL I AGREE ALSO THE ZERO TOLERANCE. IS CONFUSING TO PEOPLE BECAUSE. IT'S MISUNDERSTOOD THE OTHER THING THE OTHER PROBLEM WITH A ZERO TOLERANCE POLICY IS IT TENDS TO. ALSO DISCOURAGE PEOPLE FROM REPORTING HARASSMENT BECAUSE OF DAMOS UNDERSTAND IT TOO AND SO OFTEN SOMEONE WHO FEELS THAT THEY HAVE. BEEN THE VICTIM OF HARASSMENT. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANT SOMEONE TO LOSE THEIR JOB. THEY WANT THE BEHAVIOR TO STOP. THEY WANT TO PRESERVE THE PROFESSIONAL RELATIONSHIPS AND THEY JUST WANT THE BEHAVIOR TO STOP SO IF THERE MISINTERPRETING THE POLICY AS WELL AND BEGIN A ZERO TOLERANCE MEANS THIS PERSON WILL POTENTIALLY LOSE THEIR JOB. THEY WILL NOT REPORT AND WE ALREADY KNOW THAT HARASSMENT IS SO GROSSLY UNDER REPORTED THAT THE LAST THING WE NEED IS THE POLICY ITSELF. ON MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT AND I WOULD SAY TO THAT. YOUR POLICY YOU KNOW I SAID THE TASK FORCE SUGGESTED EVERYONE'S POLICY WHICH IS PERFECTLY LEGALLY COMPLIANT CAN BE BETTER YOUR POLICY SHOULD BE VERY SPECIFIC TO YOUR WORK PLACE. SO I CAN READ THIRTY I I'VE BEEN IN PRACTICE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS I CAN PUT THIRTY EMPLOYERS POLICIES TOGETHER AND THEY'RE SO SIMILAR. ARM AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE THAT WAY. YOU KNOW THEY THEY SHOULD SHARE SOME CHARACTERISTICS BUT THEY SHOULD BE VERY SPECIFIC TO YOUR WORKPLACE THEY SHOULD HAVE EXAMPLES THE PEOPLE IN YOUR WORKPLACE CAN PICK UP AND SAY. YUP. YUP THAT COULD HAPPEN I COULD SEE I COULD SEE THOSE THAT SITUATION IN IN MY WORKPLACE SO. THERE THERE'S REALLY A LOT OF IMPROVEMENT THAT EVERY EMPLOYER COULD MAKE. YOU KNOW WE WE HAVE AN ANONYMOUS. THE WAY NOW THAT PEOPLE CAN GIVE US SUGGESTIONS TO THIS COMMITTEE. AND SUGGEST THINGS FOR US TO THINK ABOUT AND LOOK AT. FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ARE YOU KNOW RELUCTANT TO COME FORWARD EVEN THOUGH WE ARE GONNA HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTARY HERE IN A FEW MINUTES AND PEOPLE CAN GET UP AND SPEAK TO SOME PEOPLE RATHER DO IT ANONYMOUSLY. AND ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE GOT ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE GOT WAS ABOUT THE THE USE OF ALCOHOL. BOTH SOMETIMES IN THE BUILDING AFTER HOURS AND SOMETIMES OUTSIDE I'M WONDERING IF YOU EITHER YOU HAVE A SENSE OF HOW ALCOHOL CONTRIBUTES TO ANY OF THIS OR IS THAT A RED HERRING WHERE IF WE HAD A BETTER CULTURE. THAN ALCOHOL WOULDN'T BE YOU KNOW. THE THING THAT PEOPLE ARE POINTING AT YEAH IT'S AS I SAID IT'S IT'S A DEFINITE RISK FACTOR AT ABSOLUTELY IT'S A RISK FACTOR AND I THINK IT HAS TO BE PART OF. THE DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT DO WE WANT OUR CULTURE TO BE. SO YOU COULD CHOOSE TO KEEP IT JUST AS IT IS AND I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IT IS BUT OBVIOUSLY THERE IS. ALCOHOL AVAILABLE AT CERTAIN TIMES AND EVENTS AND YOU CAN KEEP IT THAT WAY. AND THEN I GUESS OVERLAY A COMPLETELY RESPECTFUL OF. CIVIL CULTURE I THINK WHAT YOU SAID AT THE END OF THE LAST PANEL WAS SO I THINK WE SHOULD HAVE ALL JUST SAID. A MAN AND WALKED OUT BECAUSE. YOU SAID IF YOU'VE GOT A YOU KNOW A CULTURE OF CIVILITY AND RESPECT YOU CAN'T HAVE TOO MUCH OF THAT AND I THINK THAT TRULY IF YOU COULD ANY EMPLOYER COULD DO THAT THEY'VE SOLVED THE PROBLEMS. SO I THINK THE FURTHER YOU GO IN THAT DIRECTION. YOU KNOW MAYBE THAT TEMPERS A PROBLEM WITH ALCOHOL BUT ALCOHOL DOES IMPAIR JUDGMENT. AND SO AND ESPECIALLY WITH THE YOUNG WORK FORCE. MEAN THAT'S JUST THAT'S. IT'S RISKY. AND THEN I WOULD ADD THAT OF. IT WAS SORT OF JUST AS WE SAY WE DON'T DO THINGS TO PEOPLE WE DO THINGS WITH PEOPLE. SO TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT DO WE WANT OUR CULTURE TO BE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED BY SOMEONE ON TOP. YOUR OWN IMPOSED ON EVERYBODY ELSE IF YOU WANT AN EFFECTIVE ANSWER THAT QUESTION I'VE BEEN. ASKED TO PEOPLE YOU KNOW WHO ASKED THE STAFF MEMBERS US. YOU KNOW AT THE JANITORS EVEN YOU KNOW. AS THE FOOD SERVERS YOU HAVE THEM SIT DOWN WITH THE LAWMAKERS AND STAFF IN A CIRCLE WHAT DO WE WANT OUR CULTURE TO BE YOU CAN HAVE A WONDERFUL CIRCLE DISCUSSION AROUND THAT. YOU CAN COME UP WITH A PLAN SOME RECOMMENDATIONS BUT GETTING IT FROM THE PEOPLE OF YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND IS IS REALLY REALLY I THINK IMPORTANT. TO HAVE THAT TRANSFORMATIONAL CULTURE THAT WE REALLY WANT RIGHT. AND ONE OF THE. NO. SIR DIALOGUES THAT I'VE BEEN HEARING SORT OF INTERNALLY IS THAT PEOPLE WANT. A GOOD WORKPLACE IN PLACE AND A HEALTHY WORKPLACE AND SOMETHING THAT'S PROTECTIVE. TO EVERYBODY BUT THEY ALSO DON'T WANT A WORKPLACE WHERE MEMBERS NEVER AND INTERACT WITH STAFF SOCIALLY OR WHERE PEOPLE FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T JUST RELAX AND YOU KNOW YOU HEAR IT'S KIND OF THAT LONG THAT PENDULUM SHIFTING LINE. WE WANT THINGS TO BE BETTER BUT WE ALSO DON'T WANT TO HATE COMING TO WORK BECAUSE IT'S SO RIGID. YOU KNOW THAT THAT IS JUST UNPLEASANT SO I'M YOU KNOW IT'S. WELL THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS TO THIS CIRCLE STUDENTS REALLY TENDS TO BREAK DOWN THOSE BARRIERS BASED ON OUR STATUS. A WE HAVE YOUNG PEOPLE FOURTEEN YEAR OLD SITTING IN CIRCLES WITH THE CHIEF OF POLICE OR WITH JUDGES. ANOTHER ADULT SENATE THAT THE END OF THE CIRCLE DURING THE APPRECIATION CEREMONY THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE WHAT WAS A GOOD CIRCLE BECAUSE. I DON'T FEEL LIKE THE ADULTS WERE TALKING DOWN TO ME YOU KNOW I FELT LIKE WHEN I TALKED. PEOPLE HEARD OF. AND THEN WE KNOW WE'VE HAD A VERY GOOD CIRCLE OF SO CREATING THOSE SPACES WHERE OF. AUTHENTIC CONNECTION CAN OCCUR REGARDLESS OF WHETHER I'M A JANITOR YOU KNOW OR. SPEAKER THE HOUSE YOU KNOW. OF. YEAH SENATOR MORLOCK. DOCTOR DAVIS JUST ONE QUICK QUESTION. SURE WE WE SAW A LETTER FROM A HUNDRED AND FORTY WOMEN. ARE WE SAID ENOUGH AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOUR PROCESS WOULD BE HELPFUL. YES I BELIEVE SO. ESPECIALLY IF THOSE WOMEN ARE INTERESTED IN ALTERNATIVES TO PUNITIVE APPROACH IN SO MANY WOMEN ARE FOR THE REASONS THAT WERE STATED JUST EARLIER. ABOUT MY CO PANELISTS. ON. AND LIKE THE WOMEN THE DOLL HOUSE THE THEY WERE SAYING YOU KNOW THIS IS A VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. I KNOW THESE GUYS YOU KNOW WHO SAID THESE HORRIBLE THINGS ABOUT ME ON FACEBOOK. THEY'RE MY FRIENDS YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO. THEM OUT OF DENTAL SCHOOL IN THEIR CAREERS WILL BE. DESTROYED I DON'T WANT THAT FOR THEM YOU KNOW I WANNA A RESTORATIVE PRODUCTS THAT'S I WANT TO RESTORE THE PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN REALLY LEARN. SO I THINK IF THEY IF IF THE WOMEN WHO SIGNED THAT LETTER ARE INTERESTED IN ALTERNATIVES TO PUNITIVE APPROACH IS IN OUR IN OUR INTERESTED IN TRUE CHANGE. TRANSFORMATION I THINK. THIS KIND OF PROCESS COULD BE VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU WHO WILL. VICE CHAIRMAN JOHN. I THINK TO YOUR EARLIER POINT IT'S NOT JUST UP TO THE WOMAN WHO SIGNED THE LETTER BUT THOSE WHO CAUSE THEM HARM. HAVING TO BE WILLING TO STEP UP AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY AND BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO ENGAGE WITH IS NOT A ONE DIRECTIONL LINEAR KIND OF PROCESS. EVEN LISTENING TO YOU TALK ABOUT NOT WHEN THE PENDULUM TO SWING YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A FRANK CONVERSATION ABOUT APPROPRIATE EXPECTATIONS OF A WORKPLACE. WE TALK A LOT ABOUT. YOUNGER EMPLOYEES AND AND AND THEY'RE PERHAPS NAIVELY TAY ABOUT WHAT TO EXPECT. WE'VE TALKED ABOUT ALCOHOL CONSUMPTION I'M SITTING HERE THINKING YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S NOT WHO I SEE. A NEW BREED IT IN WORK RELATED FUNCTIONS IT I'M NOT COMPLAIN THAT YOUNGER EMPLOYEES IT'S ON UP THE SPECTRUM AGE SPECTRUM. OF WHAT THEY CAN SUPPORT AS WE TALK ABOUT CULTURE SHIFT WE TALK ABOUT. AND A PERFECT EXPECTATION TO HALF OF THE WORKPLACE I THINK IT VARIES FROM MEMBERS OFFICE TO MEMBERS OFFICE IN TERMS OF. THE LEVEL OF. OUTSIDE SOCIAL ENGAGEMENT. AND THERE WON'T BE ONE STRICT KIND OF WAY IN WHICH. THE LEGISLATURE HAPPENS IT VARIES BUT MEMBER TO MEMBER BUT I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE AS WE TALK ABOUT CULTURE* SHIFT TO TALK ABOUT THIS IS A HIGH STRESS. DEADLINE DRIVEN. ENVIRONMENT. NOT THAT IT'S UNIQUE TO ANY OTHER. HIGH FUNCTIONING WORKPLACE ON BUT IT IS UNIQUE IN TERMS OF DEADLINES AND AND THE IMPACTED ELECTORAL POLITICS. ALL OF THOSE THINGS AND SO GIVEN ALL THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT WE TALK ABOUT WHAT. THIS ENVIRONMENT. WHAT IS REQUIRED OF THIS ENVIRONMENT AND WHAT'S NOT? YOU KNOW THIS NOTION AND YOU HEAR IT ALL THE TIME. ABOUT THE AFTER HOURS SOCIALIZING AND LEGISLATORS WILL SAY WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO THESE EVENTS AND STAFF FEELING LIKE THEY WILL HAVE TO STAFF MY MEMBER DECEDENTS. AND MEMBERS OF THE THIRD HOUSE THEY WILL HAVE TO GO TO THESE EVENTS TO TALK TO THE MEMBERS IN THIS NOTION ABOUT. AFTER HOURS ENGAGEMENT AND. HOW WE TALK ABOUT THAT AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR WHAT IT TAKES? TO EFFECTIVELY RUN THE SIXTH LARGEST ECONOMY OF NEW IN THE WORLD. ON AND WE HAVE THE POWER TO INFLUENCE OUR CULTURE AND IN WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE AND WHAT. THE WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT CAN AND SHOULD BE. WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT THAT AND TEN I THINK IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE YOU SAY IT YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE YOUNGER PEOPLE BUT. THEY ARE SEEING. RIGHT AND SO THEN IF THEY HAVE NOTBEEN IN A WORKPLACE BEFORE THAN THEIR THINKING. OKAY THAT'S WHAT WE DO RIGHT SO. UNDER LABOR. THANK YOU TO STAY OUT QUICKLY. I HAD NEVER WORKED IN THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE DRANK. WHEN THEY WERE WORKING. AND YEAH I OKAY BUT I'M JUST THROWING IT OUT THERE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE'S A PLACE FOR EVERYTHING AND I THINK THAT YOU CAN HAVE AN ENVIRONMENT AT WORK. YOU KNOW HOW I HAD A STAFF FOR MANY YEARS US SOME OF THEM WERE SIGNIFICANTLY YOUNGER THAN ME SUMMER OLDER THAN ME. AND WE COULD GO OUT AND HAVE DINNER AND PEOPLE COULD HAVE A DRINK BUT AS THE BOSS YOU HAVE TO SET THE TONE AND IF I TOOK MYSELF OUT TO DINNER AND I GOT SLOSHED. THEN WHAT AM I SAYING TO THEM BUT DOESN'T MEAN YOU CAN'T HAVE A GOOD TIME USE HAVE BOUNDARIES AND YOU IT ULTIMATELY COMES DOWN TO THE PERSON IN CHARGE. WHO HAS TO SET THE EXAMPLE FOR EVERYONE AND I THINK MAYBE IN OUR HOUSE BOTH HOUSES WE COULD DO A LITTLE BIT BETTER JOB OF SETTING AN EXAMPLE? FEEL LIKE WE'RE STARTING TO GET INTO ONE OF THOSE CIRCLES RIGHT NOW. YOU'RE TALKING. YEAH. YOUR PRESENCE YOU WHAT YOU WANT WHEN YOU WANT WHAT. NO I I MEAN THIS THIS IS BEEN A REALLY WONDERFUL HEARING AND I APPRECIATE JUSTICE MORENO BEING HERE AND AND GIVING US YOUR EXPERTISE AND I THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE I I. I I DON'T I I'VE NOT HEARING MEMBERS DESIRING TO HAVE HIM COME BACK UP AT THIS POINT. UNLESS YOU HAVE SOME CLOSING THOUGHTS AFTER HEARING ALL OF THIS WERE HAPPY TO HEAR IT. BUT. THERE'S A LOT HERE FOR US TO THINK ABOUT OF OUR NEXT HEARING THAT WE'RE DOING. WILL BE ABOUT OUR PREVENTION AND OUR TRAINING AND YOU'VE GIVEN US THE PERFECT ENTREE INTO LOOKING AT THAT IN A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WAY. AND AFTER THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE WAITING FOR THE RESULTS OF OUR CULTURE SURVEY TO COME BACK AND OUR VICE CHAIR MS MITCHELL. VERY WISELY AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PROCESS. BROUGHT THAT FORWARD SO WE ARE DOING THAT AS WE SPEAK. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO BE GOING TO SET OUT THE YOU KNOW MORE DIFFICULT TASK OF CHANGING OUR POLICIES AND OUR PROCEDURES IN OUR TRAINING AND ALL OF THAT. AND I THINK THAT WE YOU KNOW I STARTED OUT KNOWING VERY LITTLE ABOUT SEXUAL HARASSMENT. AND I FEEL LIKE I'VE GOTTEN QUITE THE CRASH COURSE AS I THINK OUR CAPITAL COMMUNITY HAS. AND IT'S TO THE BETTER BECAUSE THIS HAVING THIS HONEST DIALOGUE. IS THE FIRST STEP TO CHANGING THE CULTURE ACKNOWLEDGING THAT THERE IS A HAS BEEN A PROBLEM THAT WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER. AND HEARING FROM EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT BEST PRACTICES ARE GIVING US IDEAS ABOUT SOLUTIONS EVEN OUT OF THE BOX SOLUTIONS. IS VERY EMPOWERING THING FOR US IS THE LEGISLATURE AND SO I'M REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE NEXT HEARING I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO STARTING TO YOU KNOW SET OUT RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STAFF TO GO OFTEN. AND HELP US CRAFT OF WHAT I THINK WILL BE THE MODEL. SEXUAL HARASSMENT POLICIES IS FOR THE FOR THE NATION AND THANK YOU FOR BEING A PART OF IT. GRANDDAUGHTERS DAVIS SAID I THINK YOU YOU ARE YOU'RE GOING TO BE THE MODEL. THANK YOU AND THANKS TO THE PANELISTS AND WITH THAT ARE HEARING IS CONCLUDED. FELT SORRY PUBLIC COMMENT I'M VERY SORRY I KEEP FORGETTING THAT. ANY MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC PLEASE YOUR IT WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO TO HEAR YOUR. THOUGHTS. THANK YOU. TO THE COMMITTEE INTO THE CHAIR AND THE VICE CHAIR AND ALL THE MEMBERS SINCE IT'S JUST BEEN A REALLY. INSPIRATIONAL HEARING I'M JIM WINDER GOING WITH THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA AND. WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING ABOUT RESTORATIVE JUSTICE. WE'VE ALSO MET WITH SAMANTHA CORE BAND AND ALICIA LEWIS. FROM WE SAID ENOUGH AND. UP BECAUSE RESTORATIVE JUSTICE IS SO VICTIM CENTERED OR PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HARMED CENTERED. WE THOUGHT THAT WE WOULD REALLY ONLY TALK TO PEOPLE IN THE BUILDING ABOUT THIS IF THEY WERE SUPPORTIVE OF IT AND. I WON'T SPEAK FOR THEM BUT THEY SAID THEY'RE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF IT. WE THINK THAT WHEN COMPLAINTS ARE FILED UP. AND WE HEARD TODAY THAT. ABOUT NINETY PERCENT OF THE SEXUAL MISCONDUCT DOES NOT RISE TO THE LEVEL OF BEING A GREGIS. HOWEVER WE DO WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT WE THINK THAT BEHAVIOR IS NEVER THE LESS. OFFENSIVE AND INAPPROPRIATE AND HARMFUL TO PEOPLE. AND OUT WHAT ARE WE TELLING PEOPLE WHO'VE ENTERED THAT BEHAVIOR AT THAT. WELL IF IT DOESN'T RISE TO THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL SORRY THERE'S REALLY NOTHING. WE CAN DO FOR YOU OR. HAVE YOU TALKED TO THE PERSON WHO DID THIS TO YOU AS IF. THE PERSON WHO'S BEEN HARMED IS SOME HOW RESPONSIBLE FOR. FIXING. THE BEHAVIOR. WE THINK THAT A RESTORATIVE JUSTICE OPTION. WOULD REALLY. BE A WAY TO DEAL WITH SO MUCH OF THIS BEHAVIOR THAT IS OFFENSIVE AND APPROPRIATE SHOULD NOT BE TOLERATED. BUT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RISE TO THE LEVEL OF CRIMINAL. OUR BEHAVIOR AND WE REALLY THINK IT IT SHOULD BE AN OPTION. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINKING THAT. SOME OF THE BEHAVIOR THAT I READ ABOUT. IN THE PAPER. IF IT HAD BEEN CONFRONTED EARLY ON UP. THAT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE REACHED THE LEVEL. OF OF BEING PERVASIVE TO WEAR IT THEN BECOMES A A CRIMINAL. ISSUE AND. THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN. MADE FOR MUCH MORE POSITIVE. OUTCOMES SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WHEN THEY COME AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'VE TALKED TO SOME IN THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY AS WELL AS THE REPRESENTATIVE AND WE SAID ENOUGH BUT. I HOPE YOU APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'VE GOT STAFF THAT ARE JUST IN THE CAPITAL COMMUNITY AND SO WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO MAKE SURE. THOSE WHO WERE DISTRICT OFFICES WHO ARE IN. ALL THE MORE ISOLATION. THAN THOSEWHO WOULDN'T EAT HERE IN THE CAPITOL BUILDING SUPPLY PREVIEW YOU HAVEN'T HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND THAT. TO THE BROADER CAPITAL. COMMUNITY AND FAMILY TO THE TO THE BROADER EXTERNAL COMMUNITY THAN THE WOMEN WHO SIGNED INTO THE LETTER AND OUR PRO ACTIVE MEMBERS OF THE WE SAID ENOUGH MOVEMENT ITS. PEOPLE BEYOND THOSE TWO GROUPS THAT WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE WE INCLUDE IN THIS DIALOGUE FIGHTS WITH SAY THAT. SEEING AS THERE IS ANYBODY ELSE WHO WANTS TO SPEAK YES. AND ANYBODY ELSE'S PLEASE COME ON LINE UP RIGHT UP AT THE MICROPHONE. THANK YOU EVENING MY NAME IS FATIMA CON FROM THE AMERICAN FRIENDS SERVICE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING AND FOR GIVING US THE ABILITY TO SPEAK. I'VE BEEN HOLDING CIRCLE IN SOME CISCO IN ALAMEDA COUNTY FOR A FEW YEARS NOW I'M SORT OF JUST THE CIRCLES AND. EARLIER THERE WAS A MENTION OF A NEED TO SHIFT THE CULTURE AND SOMETHING THAT I REALLY WANTE A HIGHLIGHT OF OUR SORT OF JUSTICE IS THAT. IT MOST DEFINITELY DOES OF A PARADIGM SHIFT DECREASE A PARADIGM SHIFT THROUGH DISCOURSE AND DIALOGUE AND WOULD ALSO DOES IS FOR THE PERSON WHO WAS HARMED IT ALLOWS THEM TO HAVE POWER. OVER THEIR SITUATION BY BEING ABLE TO ADDRESS THE PERSON BEHIND THEM AND OPEN AND ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION ASK QUESTIONS WHY DID YOU DO THIS WHY DO YOU THINK THIS WAS OKAY. NOT ONLY BUILDING COMMUNITY BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS EACH OTHER ALSO UNDERSTANDING WHERE THE DISCONNECT WAS WHAT THE HARM WAS WHITE HAPPENED HOW IT HAPPENED AND HOW WE CAN BE MOVING FORWARD. UNDERSERVED JUST AS IF IT IS USED CAN BE REALLY USES AS USEFUL TOOL TO ALLEVIATE AND ADDRESS A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING. ON IN TERMS OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT I'VE HELD RESTRICTIONS TO CIRCLES FOR YOUTH. IN AND SOME OF THOSE CIRCLES WERE CIRCLES AROUND SEXUAL MISCONDUCT HER SEXUAL HARM ON AND. BEING ABLE TO SEE PEOPLES MINDS OPENING AND A FULLY UNDERSTANDING AND TAKING ACCOUNTABILITY OF HERE'S WHAT I DID AND HERE'S WHY IT WAS NOT APPROPRIATE. ON THROUGH OPEN DISCOURSE AND DIALOGUE REALLY CREATED AT THAT SHIFT THAT WE SO BADLY NEED. AND SO I JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THOSE TWO THINGS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ANYBODY ELSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. WELL THANKS AGAIN WITHOUT WE ARE ADJOURNED
