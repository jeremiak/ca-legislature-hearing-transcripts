00:53:48.858 --> 00:53:50.961
LIFE.

00:53:51.027 --> 00:53:52.896
THE TRANSFORMATIVE WAY IN WHICH

I I JUST HEARD SOMETHING EXPRESS

00:54:32.435 --> 00:54:33.837
WHICH IS WRONG.

00:54:33.903 --> 00:54:35.605
WHICH IS NOT RIGHT.

00:54:35.672 --> 00:54:38.074
WHICH I DO NOT AGREE WITH.

00:54:38.141 --> 00:54:39.876
WHICH MAY BE A CONVENTIONAL

00:54:39.943 --> 00:54:40.377
ATTITUDE WAS NOT A RIGHT

00:54:40.443 --> 00:54:41.778
ATTITUDE.

00:54:41.845 --> 00:54:43.680

00:55:21.918 --> 00:55:22.686
HIS EYE UPON [inaudible]

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:25.355
THE KING.

00:55:25.422 --> 00:55:28.591
BUT JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS.

00:55:28.658 --> 00:55:33.430
IN THE WAY OUR SOCIETY WAS RULED

00:55:33.496 --> 00:55:33.730

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.665
EACH.

00:55:38.835 --> 00:55:42.038
IN A REFUGE FROM THE STORM.

00:55:42.105 --> 00:55:44.240
SO NOW WE HAVE WHERE SOMEONE

00:55:44.307 --> 00:55:45.742
ACTS WITH JUSTICE AND

00:55:45.809 --> 00:55:46.943
RIGHTEOUSNESS.

00:55:47.010 --> 00:55:49.045
THEY ARE CREATING SAFE SPACES

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:50.547
FOR PEOPLE.

00:55:50.613 --> 00:55:54.417
ISN'T THIS WHAT HE HAS DONE.

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:56.019
LIKE STREAMS OF WATER IN THE

00:55:56.086 --> 00:55:57.887
DESERT AND THE SHADOW OF A GREAT

00:55:57.954 --> 00:56:00.123
ROCK IN A THIRSTY LAND.

00:56:00.190 --> 00:56:01.891
THAT'S AN INTERESTING IMAGE

00:56:01.958 --> 00:56:03.126
ISAIAH.

00:56:03.193 --> 00:56:04.661
SHOT OF A GREAT ROCK AND WERE

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:07.464
LAND THAT ACTUALLY MEANS.

00:56:07.530 --> 00:56:09.499
A BIG ROCK OF THE LANDSCAPE.

00:56:09.566 --> 00:56:12.469
THAT THE SUN POUNDS UPON.

00:56:12.535 --> 00:56:15.572
THEREBY CREATING SAFE SPACES.

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:17.107
NO THAT'S SAVE QUITE A VIVID

00:56:17.173 --> 00:56:19.309
IMAGE OF LEADERSHIP.

00:56:19.375 --> 00:56:21.611
AND IT'S MOST TRAGIC DAY.

00:56:21.678 --> 00:56:23.880
IT'S AN IMAGE OF HIS LEADERSHIP.

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:26.015
THAT BY HIS LIFE.

00:56:26.082 --> 00:56:27.016
HE WAS OUT THERE IN THE BEATING

00:56:27.083 --> 00:56:28.251
SON.

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:30.887
CRITICS A SPACES FOR PEOPLE.

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:34.357
AND AND BEARING THAT COST.

00:56:34.424 --> 00:56:36.126
THEN THE EYES OF THOSE WHO SEE

00:56:36.192 --> 00:56:37.694
SAYS AYES THERE WILL NO LONGER

00:56:37.761 --> 00:56:39.496
BE CLOSED.

00:56:39.562 --> 00:56:41.064
AND THE EARS OF THOSE WHO HEAR

00:56:41.131 --> 00:56:43.700
WILL LISTEN.

00:56:43.767 --> 00:56:44.934
THIS WORK OF LEADERSHIP CHANGE

00:56:45.001 --> 00:56:45.902
THE WAY PEOPLE PERCEIVE THE

00:56:45.969 --> 00:56:47.670
WORLD AROUND THEM.

00:56:47.737 --> 00:56:51.441
OPEN OUR EYES OPEN ERRORS.

00:56:51.508 --> 00:56:52.842
THE FEARFUL HEART WILL NO ONE

00:56:52.909 --> 00:56:54.677
UNDERSTANDS.

00:56:54.744 --> 00:56:55.879
AND THE STAMMERING TONGUE WILL

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:58.381
BE FLUENT IN CLEAR.

00:56:58.448 --> 00:56:59.949
TOUCHING LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO

00:57:00.016 --> 00:57:01.184
WOULD OTHERWISE BE SEVEN THIS

00:57:01.251 --> 00:57:03.486
MAY.

00:57:03.553 --> 00:57:05.989
AND AGAIN BECAUSE OF THIS KING

00:57:06.055 --> 00:57:07.490
IN THE WAY HE CONDUCTS HIMSELF

00:57:07.557 --> 00:57:10.827
AND MARTIN LUTHER KING.

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.262
NO LONGER WILL THE FOOL BE

00:57:12.328 --> 00:57:14.097
CALLED NOBLE.

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:15.799

SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT DATE

00:57:19.836 --> 00:57:21.671
REMEMBER THE PROFOUND WORK OF DR

00:57:21.738 --> 00:57:22.972
MARTIN LUTHER KING.

00:57:23.039 --> 00:57:25.341
HIS LEADERSHIP.

00:57:25.408 --> 00:57:27.310
HIS COMMITMENT TO KINGDOM VALUES

00:57:27.377 --> 00:57:29.045
AS HE UNDERSTOOD THEM.

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.680
THE INSPIRATION AS BRENDA

00:57:30.747 --> 00:57:32.148
GENERATIONS OF LEADERS.

IT IS A MATTER OF SOME.

00:58:14.424 --> 00:58:15.592
DEBATE WITHIN THE LGBT COMMUNITY

00:58:15.658 --> 00:58:17.460
WHERE KING STOOD WHEN IT CAME TO

00:58:17.527 --> 00:58:18.494
OUR ISSUES.

00:58:18.561 --> 00:58:20.430
I MYSELF HAVE NO DEBATE ON THE

RELATED TO LGBT COMMUNITY WE

00:58:30.773 --> 00:58:33.142
KNOW WITHIN HIS MOVEMENT.

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:33.643
OUR COMMUNITY WAS ALWAYS

00:58:33.710 --> 00:58:34.544
REPRESENTED.

00:58:34.611 --> 00:58:36.346
THE MARCH IN NINETEEN SIXTY

00:58:36.412 --> 00:58:37.447
THREE WOULD NOT HAVE HAPPENED

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.916
WITHOUT THE GENIUS ABED RUSTED.

00:58:39.983 --> 00:58:41.317
A MEMBER OF OUR COMMUNITY WHO

00:58:41.384 --> 00:58:42.752
WAS OUT IN A TIME WHEN IT WAS SO

00:58:42.819 --> 00:58:44.554
DIFFICULT TO DO EMBRACED BY DR

00:58:44.621 --> 00:58:45.688
KING IS A PART OF HIS LEADERSHIP

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.490
CIRCLE.

00:58:47.557 --> 00:58:49.359
HIS WIFE HIS WIDOW CORETTA SCOTT

00:58:49.425 --> 00:58:51.194
KING WAS A PASSIONATE ELOQUENT

00:58:51.261 --> 00:58:52.729
STRONG VOICE FOR OUR COMMUNITY

00:58:52.795 --> 00:58:53.796
AGAIN WHEN IT WAS NOT

00:58:53.863 --> 00:58:56.299
NECESSARILY POPULAR. TO DO THAT

00:58:56.366 --> 00:58:58.468
SHE REMAINS AN ICON FOR EQUALITY

00:58:58.534 --> 00:59:00.904
FOR LGBT AMERICANS.

00:59:00.970 --> 00:59:02.205
AND SO WHETHER IT'S HIS WIFE FOR

00:59:02.272 --> 00:59:03.973
HIS INNER CIRCLE CLEARLY KING

00:59:04.040 --> 00:59:05.174
WAS INFLUENCED BY THE PEOPLE

00:59:05.241 --> 00:59:06.643
AROUND HIM WHO KNEW THAT

00:59:06.709 --> 00:59:08.378
EQUALITY MET NOT JUST RACIAL

00:59:08.444 --> 00:59:09.479
JUSTICE.

00:59:09.545 --> 00:59:11.281
BUT JUSTICE FOR THOSE IN THE WAY

00:59:11.347 --> 00:59:14.684
OF NOW.

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:16.252
THE TENETS OF OUR MOVEMENT OF

00:59:16.319 --> 00:59:18.454
LGBT EQUAL RIGHTS MOVEMENT ARE

00:59:18.521 --> 00:59:20.623
COMPLETELY CONNECTED. TO THE

00:59:20.690 --> 00:59:21.691
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT THE

00:59:21.758 --> 00:59:22.792
BROADER CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT.

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.127
CONCEPTS LIKE WE SHOULD BE

00:59:24.193 --> 00:59:25.295
JUDGED BY THE CONTENT OF OUR

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:26.663
CHARACTER.

00:59:26.729 --> 00:59:28.231
THAT IS EQUAL TO US THAT IS A

00:59:28.298 --> 00:59:29.565
PILLAR OF OUR MOVEMENT.

00:59:29.632 --> 00:59:31.334
THE IDEA THE INJUSTICE ANYWHERE

00:59:31.401 --> 00:59:31.834
IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE

00:59:31.901 --> 00:59:33.236
EVERYWHERE IS A PART OF OUR

00:59:33.303 --> 00:59:34.604
MOVEMENT.

00:59:34.671 --> 00:59:36.072
AND OF COURSE THE IDEA THAT

00:59:36.139 --> 00:59:38.808
SEPARATE IS NOT EQUAL IS VERY

00:59:38.875 --> 00:59:40.476
MUCH A PART OF OUR MOVEMENT.

00:59:40.543 --> 00:59:42.345
AND SO WHEN DOCTOR KING WAS

00:59:42.412 --> 00:59:43.012
OUTSPOKEN.

00:59:43.079 --> 00:59:45.315
ABOUT MARRIAGE EQUALITY WHEN IT

00:59:45.381 --> 00:59:48.184
CAME TO OF RACIAL INTEGRATION.

00:59:48.251 --> 00:59:49.719
BUT WE KNOW HE WAS ALSO TALKING.

00:59:49.786 --> 00:59:50.987
ABOUT OUR ABILITY TO HAVE

00:59:51.054 --> 00:59:52.255
MARRIAGE EQUALITY.

00:59:52.322 --> 00:59:54.257
AND I WOULD LINK UP THE ABILITY

00:59:54.324 --> 00:59:55.658
IN THE FACT THAT OUR MOVEMENTS

00:59:55.725 --> 00:59:56.793
ARE INTER TWINED BY THE FACT

00:59:56.859 --> 00:59:58.628
THAT WE TODAY ENJOY THE ABILITY

00:59:58.695 --> 01:00:00.330
TO SERVE OPENLY IN THE MILITARY.

01:00:00.396 --> 01:00:01.631

01:00:21.951 --> 01:00:23.353
THE IMPACT THE DOCTOR KING HAS

01:00:23.419 --> 01:00:24.087
MADE.

01:00:24.153 --> 01:00:26.189
IN RACIAL JUSTICE BUT ALSO FOR

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:28.458

FOR YOUR HEARING.

01:00:40.503 --> 01:00:43.006
LIFE BEGINS THE IN THE MOMENT

01:00:43.072 --> 01:00:45.008
YOU START BEING SILENT ABOUT THE

01:00:45.074 --> 01:00:46.776
THINGS THAT MATTER.

01:00:46.843 --> 01:00:49.445
IN THE END WE WERE NOT REMEMBER

01:00:49.512 --> 01:00:51.414
THE WORDS OF OUR ENEMIES BUT THE

01:00:51.481 --> 01:00:52.582
A SILENCE.

01:00:52.648 --> 01:00:54.550
OF OUR FRIENDS.

01:00:54.617 --> 01:00:55.752
WE WILL HAVE TO REPENT IN THIS

01:00:55.818 --> 01:00:58.221
GENERATION NOT MERELY FOR THEIR

01:00:58.287 --> 01:01:01.024
VITRIOLIC WORDS AND ACTION OF

01:01:01.090 --> 01:01:02.425
THE BAD PEOPLE.

01:01:02.492 --> 01:01:05.028
BUT THE APPALLING SILENCE OF THE

01:01:05.094 --> 01:01:07.163
GOOD PEOPLE THERE COMES A TIME

01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.931
THAT SILENCE IS A FORM OF

01:01:08.998 --> 01:01:13.636
BETRAYAL.

01:01:13.703 --> 01:01:15.038
DAVIS GIPSON ALL DISCUSSION ON

01:01:15.104 --> 01:01:18.741

THANK YOU I WANT TO THANK ALL OF

01:01:21.878 --> 01:01:23.212
MY COLLEAGUES IN THE VARIOUS

01:01:23.279 --> 01:01:25.648
CAUCUSES WHO'VE TAKEN THE TIME

01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.283
TO RESPOND TO THIS RESOLUTION.

01:01:27.350 --> 01:01:28.751
AND TO GIVE US QUOTES AND AND

01:01:28.818 --> 01:01:30.653
ASPECTS OF DR KING'S LIFE WHICH

01:01:30.720 --> 01:01:31.988
WAS AN AMAZING LIFE.

01:01:32.055 --> 01:01:33.890
THAT RESULTED IN A VERY EARLY AN

01:01:33.956 --> 01:01:36.159
UNFORTUNATE DEATH.

01:01:36.225 --> 01:01:37.860
IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME SOME LAST

01:01:37.927 --> 01:01:39.095
YEAR AS I LISTEN TO MY

01:01:39.162 --> 01:01:40.696
COLLEAGUES AT THE FIFTIETH

01:01:40.763 --> 01:01:42.265
ANNIVERSARY OF DR KING'S

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:44.100
ASSASSINATION.

01:01:44.167 --> 01:01:45.334
THAT MOST OF YOU DID NOT LIVE

01:01:45.401 --> 01:01:47.336
DURING THE TIME OF KING.

01:01:47.403 --> 01:01:48.504
THERE WERE FEW OF US WHO DID IT

01:01:48.571 --> 01:01:50.239
AND I WAS ONE OF THOSE.

01:01:50.306 --> 01:01:51.808
AND SO MOST OF YOUR KNOWLEDGE

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:52.942
AND FEELINGS ABOUT KING A REALLY

01:01:53.009 --> 01:01:54.811
FROM A BOOK.

01:01:54.877 --> 01:01:56.045
FROM THE MOVIE FROM SOME STORIES

01:01:56.112 --> 01:01:58.114
OF PEOPLE TOLD YOU.

01:01:58.181 --> 01:01:59.549
AS I POINTED OUT YESTERDAY I WAS

01:01:59.615 --> 01:02:01.684
A STUDENT UCLA.

01:02:01.751 --> 01:02:02.618
WHEN WE GOT THE WORD THE DOCTOR

01:02:02.685 --> 01:02:04.387
KING HAD BEEN KILLED?

01:02:04.454 --> 01:02:06.255
IT WAS UNBELIEVABLE THAT A MAN

01:02:06.322 --> 01:02:07.356
OF PEACE.

01:02:07.423 --> 01:02:08.391
COULD BE TAKEN AWAY IN SUCH A

01:02:08.458 --> 01:02:10.259
VIOLENT ACT.

01:02:10.326 --> 01:02:12.495
AND A LEFT US ALL WONDERING

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:14.230
ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY.

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.466
WE ALSO BETRAYED.

01:02:16.532 --> 01:02:17.900
WE OUGHT WE ALL FELT THAT

01:02:17.967 --> 01:02:18.801
SOMEHOW ANOTHER.

01:02:18.868 --> 01:02:20.203
ALL OF THE GOOD THAT THIS MAN

01:02:20.269 --> 01:02:21.804
HAD DONE.

01:02:21.871 --> 01:02:24.307
WAS TO EXPOSE THE HATRED.

01:02:24.373 --> 01:02:26.075
OF OF THOSE WHO ARE IRRATIONAL.

01:02:26.142 --> 01:02:28.611
TO TAKE HIS LIFE.

01:02:28.678 --> 01:02:30.213
AND WE WONDERED IF THE DREAM

01:02:30.279 --> 01:02:32.415
WOULD DIE WOULD DOCTOR KING.

01:02:32.482 --> 01:02:33.649
WAS THERE NOT PLANTED IN

01:02:33.716 --> 01:02:35.318
INDIVIDUALS IN THIS NATION TO

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:37.086
CONTINUE TO FIGHT FOR WHAT WAS

01:02:37.153 --> 01:02:39.622
RIGHT AND WHAT WAS JUST.

01:02:39.689 --> 01:02:40.590
AND THOSE WHO WERE MOST

01:02:40.656 --> 01:02:42.291
FRUSTRATED TOOK THE STREETS AND

01:02:42.358 --> 01:02:43.426
BURN THE CITIES.%

01:02:43.493 --> 01:02:45.428
BECAUSE THEY WERE SO ANGRY ABOUT

01:02:45.495 --> 01:02:47.029
THE FACT THAT DOCTOR KING WAS

01:02:47.096 --> 01:02:48.131
DEAD.

01:02:48.197 --> 01:02:49.866
THAT THE KING WAS THE IT.

01:02:49.932 --> 01:02:51.934
THE DREAM WOULD NOT GO FORWARD.

01:02:52.001 --> 01:02:53.202
AND THAT ALL OF THE FIVE THINGS

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.270
THAT WE'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR

01:02:54.337 --> 01:02:56.038
WOULD BE MESSED.

01:02:56.105 --> 01:02:58.040
MOST OF US KNOW ABOUT THE SOUTH.

01:02:58.107 --> 01:02:59.475
AB MY FAMILY HAD COME FROM THE

01:02:59.542 --> 01:03:01.043
SOUTH AND I VISITED THE SOUTH

01:03:01.110 --> 01:03:03.279
MANY TIMES AS A CHILD.

01:03:03.346 --> 01:03:04.847
AND WE DO OF THE UGLINESS OF

01:03:04.914 --> 01:03:07.083
RACISM AND DISCRIMINATION.

01:03:07.150 --> 01:03:09.285
WE KNEW HOW IT MADE PEOPLE FEEL.

01:03:09.352 --> 01:03:10.486
MOST OF US THAT HAVE RELATIVES

01:03:10.553 --> 01:03:12.688
MY GRANDFATHER NEVER HAD THE

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:14.290
CHANCE TO VOTE IN THIS NATION.

01:03:14.357 --> 01:03:15.625
WAS A CITIZEN OF THIS NATION

01:03:15.691 --> 01:03:17.527
BORN IN THIS COUNTRY BUT NEVER

01:03:17.593 --> 01:03:18.895
HAD THE RIGHT TO VOTE IN HOPE

01:03:18.961 --> 01:03:20.263
ARKANSAS.

01:03:20.329 --> 01:03:22.598
AND SO WE UNDERSTOOD WHAT IT WAS

01:03:22.665 --> 01:03:24.033
TO TALK ABOUT JIM CROW IN A VERY

01:03:24.100 --> 01:03:25.067
REAL SENSE.

01:03:25.134 --> 01:03:26.435
AND I KNEW WHAT IT WAS LIKE TO

01:03:26.502 --> 01:03:28.104
TRAVEL TO THE SOUTH AND NOT BE

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.739
ABLE TO GO TO THE RESTROOM.

01:03:29.805 --> 01:03:31.040
THURGOOD MARSHALL TALKED ABOUT

01:03:31.107 --> 01:03:32.408
THAT IT IS NOT JUST AN

01:03:32.475 --> 01:03:34.477
INCONVENIENCE RACISM IT IS IT

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.212
TAKES AWAY YOUR DIGNITY AND YOUR

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.747
PRIDE AS A RESULT OF NOT BEING

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:39.182
ABLE TO DO JUST THE SIMPLE

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.217
THINGS OF LIFE.

01:03:41.284 --> 01:03:42.318
AND SO DR KING'S LIFE

01:03:42.385 --> 01:03:44.754
REPRESENTED ALL OF THAT TO US.

01:03:44.820 --> 01:03:47.356
AND SO HERE WE STOOD AT UCLA AND

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:49.392
AROUND THE NATION YOUNG PEOPLE.

01:03:49.458 --> 01:03:49.959
WONDERING WHAT WAS GOING TO

01:03:50.026 --> 01:03:51.294
HAPPEN.

01:03:51.360 --> 01:03:52.962
WE'RE BEING TOLD BY ALL OF THE

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.064
OTHER ORGANIZATIONS ORGANIZATION

01:03:55.131 --> 01:03:56.232
THE PAMPA ORGANIZATION AND

01:03:56.299 --> 01:03:57.733
OTHERS.

01:03:57.800 --> 01:03:59.168
THAT NONVIOLENCE DID NOT WORK.

01:03:59.235 --> 01:04:00.403
BUT ALL IT DID WAS PRODUCE

01:04:00.469 --> 01:04:02.438
VIOLENCE IN KING'S LIFE WAS AN

01:04:02.505 --> 01:04:03.973
EXAMPLE OF THAT.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.374
AND SO WE HAD SOME ISSUES AND

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:07.109
CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER NOT THIS

01:04:07.176 --> 01:04:08.978
COUNTRY WOULD CONTINUE THE

01:04:09.045 --> 01:04:10.546
LEGACY TO CONTINUE THE WORK.

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.615
THAT HAD NOT BEEN FINISHED.

01:04:12.682 --> 01:04:14.550
WE STILL HAVE A QUESTION TODAY.

01:04:14.617 --> 01:04:16.786
IT HAS NOT GONE AWAY.

01:04:16.852 --> 01:04:18.254
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THIS

01:04:18.321 --> 01:04:19.589
COUNTRY IS AFRICAN AMERICANS

01:04:19.655 --> 01:04:22.091
CONTINUE. TO BE CHALLENGES WE

01:04:22.158 --> 01:04:24.493
FACE EACH AND EVERY DAY.

01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:25.461
AND WE WILL KNOW THAT AT THE

01:04:25.528 --> 01:04:26.963
TIME OF KING'S DEATH BUT HE WAS

01:04:27.029 --> 01:04:28.698
NOT A POPULAR PERSON.

01:04:28.764 --> 01:04:29.966
HE'S VERY POPULAR TODAY BECAUSE

01:04:30.032 --> 01:04:32.134
HE'S NOT A LOT.

01:04:32.201 --> 01:04:33.703
YES HE'S NOT CONTINUE TO

01:04:33.769 --> 01:04:35.705
CHALLENGE US DIRECTLY.

01:04:35.771 --> 01:04:36.706
BUT HE WAS NOT POPULAR WHEN HE

01:04:36.772 --> 01:04:38.841
DIED.

01:04:38.908 --> 01:04:39.875
WE KNEW THAT HE WAS HE HAD LOW

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:41.677
APPROVAL RATINGS IN MANY

01:04:41.744 --> 01:04:42.878
COMMUNITIES.

01:04:42.945 --> 01:04:44.647
HE WAS SEEN AS THE ENEMY THE F.

01:04:44.714 --> 01:04:47.016
B. I.'S SAW HIM AS THE ENEMY AND

01:04:47.083 --> 01:04:48.718
THE AND THE WORST THING --

01:04:48.784 --> 01:04:50.486
TO FOR DEMOCRACY IN THIS COUNTRY.

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:51.887
AND SO HE LIVED THE LIFE THAT

01:04:51.954 --> 01:04:53.723
WAS DIFFICULT.

01:04:53.789 --> 01:04:56.158
HE CAME TO SAN DIEGO AND NONE OF

01:04:56.225 --> 01:04:57.193
THE BLACK MINISTERS WILL LET HIM

01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:58.327
SPEAK AT THE CHURCHES IN THE

01:04:58.394 --> 01:04:59.161
SIXTIES.

01:04:59.228 --> 01:05:00.529
BECAUSE THEY WERE AFRAID OF

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:03.199
BEING SEEN WITH THIS RADICAL.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.400
AND SO HE INSTEAD HE SPOKE IN

01:05:04.467 --> 01:05:06.068
THE GYMNASIUM AT SAN DIEGO STATE.

01:05:06.135 --> 01:05:07.570
AND THAT BECAME THE PRIDE OF SAN

01:05:07.637 --> 01:05:09.372
DIEGO STATE THAT THEY OPEN THEIR

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:11.140
DOORS TO MARTIN LUTHER KING.

01:05:11.207 --> 01:05:12.308
BUT THE BLACK COMMUNITY IN THE

01:05:12.375 --> 01:05:13.142
MINISTER'S WOULD NOT LET HIM

01:05:13.209 --> 01:05:14.677
SPEAK FOR FEAR OF WHAT WOULD

01:05:14.744 --> 01:05:15.745
HAPPEN TO THEM.

01:05:15.811 --> 01:05:17.346
AND THEY'D BE IDENTIFIED WITH

01:05:17.413 --> 01:05:19.215
HIS RADICAL INDIVIDUALS IN THE

01:05:19.282 --> 01:05:21.250
EARLY NINETEEN SIXTIES.

01:05:21.317 --> 01:05:22.818
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT KING.

01:05:22.885 --> 01:05:24.754
IF WE WANT TO BE LIKE KING.

01:05:24.820 --> 01:05:26.022
YOU HAVE TO REALIZE THAT YOU'RE

01:05:26.088 --> 01:05:27.823
GOING TO BE UNPOPULAR TIMES.

01:05:27.890 --> 01:05:28.858
BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IS

01:05:28.924 --> 01:05:31.127
RIGHT AND WHAT IS JUST.

01:05:31.193 --> 01:05:32.395
AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS A POPULARITY

01:05:32.461 --> 01:05:35.298
CONTEST WE SEE THAT EVERY DAY.

01:05:35.364 --> 01:05:36.165
WHAT WE HAVE THE UNIQUE

01:05:36.232 --> 01:05:38.334
OPPORTUNITY IN A UNIQUE CHANCE

01:05:38.401 --> 01:05:39.201
TO BE THE DOCTOR KING OF OUR

01:05:39.268 --> 01:05:41.504
GENERATION? TO DEAL WITH THE

01:05:41.570 --> 01:05:43.005
DIFFICULT ISSUES THEN THE HARD

01:05:43.072 --> 01:05:44.073
ISSUES.

01:05:44.140 --> 01:05:45.775
AND TRY TO BRING SOME JUSTICE

01:05:45.841 --> 01:05:47.710
AND EQUALITY TO SO MANY.

KNOW ANY OTHER HOME THEN THE

01:12:27.142 --> 01:12:28.744
UNITED STATES --

01:12:28.811 --> 01:12:30.713
AND WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE IT'S

01:12:30.779 --> 01:12:32.281
NOT DISSIMILAR TO THE ISSUES

01:12:32.347 --> 01:12:33.882
HAPPENING RIGHT NOW WHEN WE

01:12:33.949 --> 01:12:35.317
THINK ABOUT THE CENTRAL AMERICAN

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:38.087
REFUGEES WHO ARE SEEKING ASYLUM.

01:12:38.153 --> 01:12:39.455
AND SOME MAY THINK WELL THIS WAS

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:42.024
DECADES AGO THAT'S IN THE PAST.

01:12:42.091 --> 01:12:44.059
BUT IT'S ACTUALLY FAR FROM

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:46.328
HISTORY BECAUSE THE REALITY IS

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:48.197
THAT AS SOON AS MANY OF THESE

01:12:48.263 --> 01:12:50.699
REFUGEES CAME TO OUR SHORES AND

01:12:50.766 --> 01:12:52.434
MADE AMERICA THEIR HOME THEY

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:54.069
STARTED EXERCISING THE RIGHTS

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:55.771
THAT THEY HAVE IN THIS NATION.

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.539
OF FREEDOM THE RIGHTS TO FREEDOM

01:12:57.606 --> 01:12:58.974
OF SPEECH THEY'VE SPOKEN UP

01:12:59.041 --> 01:13:00.309
AGAINST THE GOVERNMENT AND

01:13:00.375 --> 01:13:02.845
VIETNAM NOT JUST TWENTY THIRTY

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:04.313
OR FORTY YEARS AGO BUT TO THIS

01:13:04.379 --> 01:13:05.581
DAY.

01:13:05.647 --> 01:13:07.416
AND WE KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:09.785
VIETNAM RIGHT NOW THEIR JAILING

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:10.686
PEOPLE THEY'RE BEATING PEOPLE

01:13:10.753 --> 01:13:11.553
THEY'RE KILLING PEOPLE THAT ARE

01:13:11.620 --> 01:13:12.955
SPEAKING UP.

01:13:13.021 --> 01:13:14.356
THE SPEEDING UP TO STAND UP FOR

01:13:14.423 --> 01:13:16.024
HUMAN RIGHTS TO STAND AGAINST

01:13:16.091 --> 01:13:17.760
ENVIRONMENTAL POLLUTION.

01:13:17.826 --> 01:13:19.428
IN THEIR NATION AND TO STAND UP

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:20.763
AGAINST AGGRESSION FROM THEIR

01:13:20.829 --> 01:13:22.197
NEIGHBORS.

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:24.533
AND SO THIS IS A VERY REAL

01:13:24.600 --> 01:13:27.236
THREAT IT'S NOT EXISTENTIALISTS.

01:13:27.302 --> 01:13:30.839
IF INDIVIDUALS ARE DEPORTED BACK.

01:13:30.906 --> 01:13:31.940
TO BE AT NAM THEY VERY VERY

01:13:32.007 --> 01:13:34.510
LIKELY WILL BE IMPRISONED.

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:36.378
JAILED FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:38.781
THEY COULD BE PHYSICALLY HARMED.

01:13:38.847 --> 01:13:40.516
AND CERTAINLY THERE LIFE CAN BE

01:13:40.582 --> 01:13:43.118
THREATENED SO THIS IS NOT --

01:13:43.185 --> 01:13:43.685
AN ISSUE BUT WE'RE THINKING

01:13:43.752 --> 01:13:47.222
ABOUT SOME ARE TRYING TO PROTECT

01:13:47.289 --> 01:13:48.190
OF FOLKS WHO NOW CALL AMERICA

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.092
HOME WHICH THEY DO AND THAT BY

01:13:50.159 --> 01:13:52.294
ITSELF WOULD BE VALID AND OF

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:53.428
VALUE.

01:13:53.495 --> 01:13:54.897
HOWEVER THIS IS A REAL THREAT

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.865
AND LIVES ARE BEING PLAYED WITH

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:58.300
IN A WAY --

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:01.170
THAT IS DANGEROUS AND WE

01:14:01.236 --> 01:14:02.671
ABSOLUTELY SHOULD NOT BE.

01:14:02.738 --> 01:14:04.072
MANIPULATING OUR IMMIGRATION

01:14:04.139 --> 01:14:05.774
SYSTEM OR AGREEMENTS WE HAVE

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:06.375
WITH OTHER NATIONS THAT HAVE

01:14:06.442 --> 01:14:08.143
BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO PROTECT

01:14:08.210 --> 01:14:09.511
AMERICANS PROTECT PEOPLE AND

01:14:09.578 --> 01:14:11.280
PROTECT THOSE WHO CALL THIS

01:14:11.346 --> 01:14:12.881
NATION HOME.

01:14:12.948 --> 01:14:16.018

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:18.974
WHY THE UNITED STATES WOULD WANT

01:16:19.041 --> 01:16:21.143

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:22.411
