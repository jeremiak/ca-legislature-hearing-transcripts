THEN WE ARE ENABLING AND HEIRONEOUS BELIEVE THAT VICTIMS CAN SOMEHOW PROVOKE THE PERPETRATOR FROM COMMITTING SXUAL ASSAULT THIS ATTITUDE WRONGLY PLACES THE BLAME ON THE SURVIVOR INSTEAD F WHERE SHOULD BE PLACED SQUARELY ON THE PERPETRATOR WHO COMMITTED A CRIME EVENT EVEN THE POSSIBILITY THAT I WOULD A SURVIVOR WAS WARY MAY BE ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE DURING THE COURSE OF A CRIMINAL TRIAL DETERS MANY SURVIVORS FROM SEEKING JUSTICE. THIS ARE ACTUALLY WAS A BILL THAT WAS ENACTED IN FLORIDA AFTER NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE CASE IN WHICH A PERPETRATOR WAS ACQUITTED OF A CHARGE OF RAPE AFTER THE FACT THAT THE SURVIVOR WAS WEARING A SKIRT I WAS ADMITTED INTO EVIDENCE CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE LEADING THE WAY NOT FOLLOWING AND PROTECTING THE RIGHTS OF SURVIVORS THIS BILL WILL RECTIFY THE POWER IMBALANCES THAT EXIST BETWEEN PERPETRATORS AND SURVIVORS AND DECLARED DEFINITIVELY THAT IT OFF IT NEVER PROVIDES CONSENT EVER.

WHEN A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT IS BRAVE ENOUGH TO SHARE THEIR STORY THE QUESTION OF BUT WHAT WERE YOU WEARING. NOT ONLY BLAMES THE VICTIM FOR PROVOKING THE ASSAULT BUT IT ALSO SUGGESTED PERPETRATOR HAD AN EXCUSE FOR HIS ACTIONS OR HER ACTIONS. THERE IS NO EXCUSE FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT IN SURVIVORS SHOULD NOT BE MADE TO FEEL GUILT OR SHAME ESPECIALLY BY OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM. WHICH SHOULD BE WORKING TO PROTECT THEM. AN OUTFIT DOES NOT GIVE CONSENT AND REMOVING THIS SUGGESTION FROM  SEXUAL ASSAULT TRIAL IS LONG OVERDUE. IT IS FOR THESE REASONS THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR SAY AIRTEL THIS BARRICADE HAN YOU ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE REAR CHAMBER THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND I RISE IN SUPPORT OF AB NINE THIRTY NINE I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER INCREDIBLE DILIGENCE. ON THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND FINDING THIS PIECE OF LAW THAT WE KNOW ALTHOUGH IT WAS BROUGHT UP IN COMMITTEE THAT MANY JUDGES WOULDN'T ALLOW THIS EVIDENCE AFTER THE HEARING THAT OUR LAW CURRENTLY ALLOWS I THINK THAT WHAT THE AUTHOR HAS SO APTLY FOCUSED ON. IS WHAT IT MEANS TO BE A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND WHAT IT MEANS TO BE PUT THROUGH THAT HEARING WERE OUTSIDE. OF THE PRESENCE OF THE JURY WE PUT THE VICTIM ON THE STAND AND WE DO A HEARING ON WHAT THE VICTIM WAS WEARING DURING THE RATE. THAT IS ENOUGH FOR US TO SAY THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE CARE ABOUT THESE VICTIMS THAT WE WILL NOT PUT THEM THROUGH THAT MISERY TO RELIVE THE TRAUMA OF THEIR RAPE. AND ENSURE THAT WE STAND FIRMLY ON THE GROUND THAT CLOTHING CAN NEVER BE EVIDENCE OF CONSENT AND SO THAT HEARING IS UNNECESSARY AND JUST RE VICTIMIZATION OF THE PERSON WHO HAS SUFFERED TOO MUCH ALREADY SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER WORK ON THIS MEASURE.

DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS ARE THE WORKERS WHO HELPFUL FILL THIS PROMISE BY SPENDING THEIR CAREER GOING TO WORK ASSISTING COACHING. MENTORING ENCOURAGING ADVOCATING FOR OUR CITIZENS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES. I RISE TODAY TO RECOGNIZE AND TO HONOR THEM. WHETHER ASSISTING PEOPLE TO LIVE AS INDEPENDENTLY AS POSSIBLE TO SUCCEED AT WORK OR TO PROVIDE RESPITE AND SUPPORT FOR FAMILIES THESE PEOPLE HAVE DEDICATED THEMSELVES TO A LIFE OF SERVICE TO OTHERS. TODAY FOURTEEN MONTHS AFTER OUR STATE'S LOCKDOWN STARTED DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN. IT IS CLEARER THAN EVER THAT THE TERM PROFESSIONAL FITS THESE INDIVIDUALS. THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED WE HAVE COUNTLESS EXAMPLES OF HOW DIRECT SUPPORT PROFESSIONALS HAVE INNOVATED ADAPTED AND MADE HERE ROURKE PERSONAL SACRIFICES TO EASE THE DIFFICULTIES FACED. BY PEOPLE THEY SERVE. MANY HAVE BECOME SICK OVER THE PAST YEAR MANY HAVE ISOLATED AWAY FROM THEIR OWN FAMILIES. FRIENDS IN ORDER TO BE THERE AND MAKE LIFE MORE BEARABLE FOR THE PEOPLE THEY SERVE. I QUITE FRANKLY AM IN AWE. OF THEIR DEDICATION AND THEIR PROFESSIONALISM. AND I WOULD BE REMISS IF I FAILED TO MENTION THAT THIS WORKFORCE REMAINS WOEFULLY UNDERAPPRECIATED.

WE'VE ALL HEARD OF THE TRAGEDIES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO AFTER SERVING YEARS IN PRISON HAVING PAID THEIR DEBT TO SOCIETY THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE RELEASED AND THEY'RE CERTAINLY TRANSFERRED TO ICE. WHAT WE DON'T HEARING THOSE STORIES IS THAT MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS DID NOTE THAT THE CRIMES THEY WERE CONVICTED OF OUR REPORTABLE CRIMES- LAW ALREADY SO. IT OF SOME IS GONNA OF AT FROM. IMMIGRATION THE NEW CONVICTION COULD BE LEGALLY. INTO SIXTEEN LEGISLATURE CREATED A PROCESS FOR INDIVIDUALS ON A WHERE. OF THESE IMMIGRATION CONSEQUENCES TO PETITION THE COURT. BUT THE CAR PROCESS IS ONLY AVAILABLE TO THOSE CONVICTED BY PLEA BARGAIN. NOT TO THOSE CONVICTED BY TRIAL. PEOPLE HAVE A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO A TRIAL WE SHOULDN'T PUNISH INDIVIDUALS FOR PURSUING TRIALS AND TRYING TO PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE WE KNOW THE CONSEQUENCES CAN BE DEVASTATING FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. PEOPLE TORN FROM THEIR FAMILIES HAVING THEIR PATHWAY TO CITIZENSHIP BLOCKED BASED ON LEGALLY INVALID CONVICTIONS.

COOKERY ASSEMBLY BILL FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE BY SOME REMEMBER BERMAN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS MR BERMAN. THANKS THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER COLLEAGUES WHEN KAMEL HARRIS RESIGNED HER U. S. SENATE SEAT IN ADVANCE OF BEING SWORN IN AS VICE PRESIDENT IN JANUARY IT CREATED A VACANCY IN CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS. BECAUSE CENTER PRETTY WAS APPOINTED TO A TERM THAT ENDS ON JANUARY THIRD FOLLOWING THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION EXISTING STATE LAW ALLOWS HIM TO REMAIN IN OFFICE UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF THAT TERM ON JANUARY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY THREE. TO FEDERAL APPELLATE COURT OPINIONS ISSUED SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN HOWEVER HAVE RAISED QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER THAT ASPECT OF STATE LAW COMPLIES THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE U. S. CONSTITUTION. AB FORTY NINETY FIVE AND SHORES THAT CALIFORNIA LAW IS CONSISTENT WITH THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT BY PROVIDING FOR AN ELECTION TO BE HELD TO FILL A VACANCY IN CALIFORNIA'S REPRESENTATION IN THE U. S. SENATE. EVEN IF THE VACANCY OCCURS DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS OF THE U. S. SENATE TERM IN ORDER TO ENSURE THE GREATEST PARTICIPATION IN THOSE ELECTIONS AND TO AVOID THE COSTLY DISRUPTIONS OF STANDALONE STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTIONS WHENEVER POSSIBLE A. B. FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE GENERALLY REQUIRES U. S. SENATE VACANCY ELECTIONS TO BE CONSOLIDATED. WITH REGULARLY SCHEDULED STATEWIDE ELECTIONS WHERE THAT IS NOT POSSIBLE THE BILL ALSO ESTABLISHES A PROCEDURE FOR THE GOVERNOR TO SCHEDULE. STATEWIDE SPECIAL ELECTIONS TO FILL THE VACANCY IF IT IS PRACTICAL TO DO SO BEFORE THE END OF THE TERM SB FOURTEEN NINETY FIVE A SUPPORT ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA CONSERVATION VOTERS AND THAT'S A YOU CALIFORNIA. AND HAS NO OPPOSITION I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK MR BERMAN MISS KILEY YOU'RE A- THANK YOU SPEAKER I THIS BILL IS DUE RESPOND TO A LEGAL UP THAT I'VE FROM OUR LEAD TO COUNCIL'S OFF- WHICH CONCLUDED. THAT THE CURRENT PLAN FOR OUR ELECTED SENATOR ALEX PADILLA TO SERVE THE REMAINDER OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN KAMILLA HARRIS IS TERM IS CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING STATE STATUTE- BUT AS ALLUDED TO BY THE AUTHOR IS IN VIOLATION OF THE SEVENTEENTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION. SO I'M GLAD THAT WITH THIS BILL THERE'S A RECOGNITION THAT WE NEED TO NOT VIOLATE THE CONSTITUTION- BUT THIS BILL SEEKS TO SOLVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL PROBLEM IN THE MOST ON THE DEMOCRATIC CONCEIVABLE WAY BY KICKING THE CONSTITUTIONALLY REQUIRED ELECTION OF A REPLACEMENT SENATOR TO THE LAST POSSIBLE CONSTITUTIONALLY ALLOWABLE MOMENT THAT IS IN COMBINATION WITH THE NEXT REGULARLY SCHEDULED ELECTION. SO THE RESULT OF THIS SCHEME TO REDUCE THE WILL OF CALIFORNIA VOTERS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE IS IT WILL PRODUCE A TOTAL ABSURDITY NEXT YEAR WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THE SAME U. S. SENATE RACE ON YOUR BALLOT TWICE YOU'LL VOTE ONCE PER WHO WILL SERVE THE LAST MONTH OR TWO. OF WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN KAMILLA HARRIS IS TERM AND YOU'LL HAVE A SECOND VOTE ON WHO WILL SERVE THE NEW SIX YEAR TERM IN MY VIEW THE BETTER APPROACH WOULD BE TO HAVE AN ELECTION AS SOON AS POSSIBLE TO RESTORE CALIFORNIA'S FULL ALLOTMENT OF TWO ELECTED UNITED STATES SENATORS THIS IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT. WHEN WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO IS OUT MUSING ABOUT WHO HE'LL APPOINT TO REPLACE DIANNE FEINSTEIN WHO HASN'T EVEN INDICATED THAT SHE'S GOING TO RESIGN SO I THINK THAT THIS BILL MOVES US IN EXACTLY THE WRONG DIRECTION. AND I WOULD URGE A NO VOTE. THIS MISTER GALLAGHER YOU'RE RECOGNIZED. YEAH I THINK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I THINK ANOTHER THING TO POINT OUT ABOUT THIS BILL IS IN DIRECT CONTRAVENTION TO THE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT THAT MADE IT WOULD HAVE DIRECT ELECTIONS OF OUR SENATORS IT USED TO BE THAT STATE LEGISLATURES. WOULD PICK THE SENATORS FOR THEIR STATE AND OUR US CONSTITUTION WAS CHANGED SHOULDN'T IT BE THAT. TO ME THIS IS VERY ANTI DEMOCRATIC TO SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE. AN ELECTION TO ALLOW TE VOTERS TO CHOOSE THEIR U. S. SENATOR AT THE AT THE MOST EARLY OPPORTUNITY POSSIBLE. THAT IS WHAT THIS WAS ALL ABOUT WAS TO ALLOW THE PEOPLE TO DIRECTLY CHOOSE. THEIR SENATORS NOT TO ALLOW ONE PERSON. TO CHOOSE THE CENTER OF THIS EVEN LESS DEMOCRATIC NOW THEY WERE ALLOWING ONE PERSON THIS GOVERNOR WHO AS WE KNOW IS ABUSED MANY OF HIS POWERS- HERE RECENTLY. TO ALLOW ONE PERSON TO MAKE THAT CHOICE FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA. SO IF YOU'RE TO ME IF YOU'RE SUPPORTING DEMOCRATIC VALUES YOU SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY THANK YOU. I THINK IT WAS GALLAGHER MISS POWER K. HAND IN THE REAR OF THE CHAMBER YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I JUST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY I CARE DEEPLY ABOUT DEMOCRATIC VALUES. AND WHAT HAS HAPPENED FOLLOWS DEMOCRATIC VALUES BUT IN ADDITION THE MILLIONS THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE SPEND ON EXTRA ELECTIONS BEFORE WE ARE ABOUT TO HAVE A REGULAR SCHEDULE ACTION IS A WASTE OF CALIFORNIA'S TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US DEMOCRATS REPUBLICANS ALIKE TO BE AS RESPONSIBLE AS WE CAN WITH THOSE HARD EARNED TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THAT IS PART OF WHAT THE AUTHOR IS DOING HERE TODAY SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO OTHER. SEEKING RECOGNITION. ON MR BERMAN'S BILL MR BERMAN YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I JUST A FOLLOW UP FOR MY CALL AGAIN FROM AROUND- I WOULD JUST SAY THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY THE FISCALLY PRUDENT BUT EVEN FISCALLY CONSERVATIVE THING TO DO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THAT'S THE FIRST MISS BERMAN. WITH THAT CLERK LEVEL ROLE ALL MEMBERS. IT IS OUT OF A- ALL VOTERS OUT OF. PAUL MEMBERS IT IS OUT OF. CLERK WILL. CLOSE ROLE TIDE ABOUT I.

AB FIFTEEN FIFTY SIX IS A CONSUMR PROTECTION MEASURE SPONSORSHIP WE BY THE COULD NINETEEN AFFECT ON THEATERS WHICH THOUSANDS OF A LIVE EVENTS WERE CANCELED ACROSS THE STATE NOW MOST TICKET SELLERS DID THE RIGHT THING AND THEY OFFER PEOPLE A REFUND OR THEY OFFERED THEM A SUBSTITUTE PERFORMANCE. BUT EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC WE HAD SITUATIONS WHERE SOME TICKET SELLERS WOULD SELL A TICKET TO AN EVENT THE EVENT WILL BE CANCELED FOR SOME REASON AND THEY EITHER WOULDN'T RETURN THE PERSON'S MONEY OR THEY WOULD SAY WELL WE HAVE A SUBSTITUTE UP PERFORMANCE SO YOU HAVE TO TAKE THAT RATHER THAN GET YOUR MONEY BACK. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE TICKET THE TICKET PRICE FOR CANCEL EVENT BE REFUNDED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF THE CANCELLATION OF THE TICKET PRICE FOR POSTPONED OR SCHEDULED EVENT BEFORE WE REFUNDED WITHIN THIRTY DAYS OF A REQUEST BY A TICKET BUYER. IN ADDITION IT REQUIRES A TICKET SELLER TO LET PEOPLE KNOW IN ADVANCE WHEN THEY BUY THE TICKET WHETHER OR NOT THAT TICKET IS ABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A THIRD PARTY SO THEY DON'T GIVE THE TICKET TO UNCLE BOB ONLY TO HAVE UNCLE BOB TURNED AWAY AT THE BOX OFFICE BECAUSE. THEY WERE THE ONES THAT HAD TO USE THAT TICKET. TICKET SELLERS- WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. THE THEATER IN THE TICKET SELLER TO GET TO A VERY GOOD PLACE ON THE BILL- LAW KERN. STATES THE A TICKET BY MAY REFER. A REFUND AN EVENT IS CANCER. THE CURRENT LAW. DOES NOT STATE WHAT THE COST SHOULD GET THEIR MONEY BACK AND THIS IS A- RESULTED IN TIGHT IN CASES WHERE PEOPLE CAN.
