FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND OUR JOB

IT'S ME THE- THINGS. AS A LEASE

00:43:19.463 --> 00:43:20.597
GOT MENTIONED THAT WE HAVE SOME

00:43:20.664 --> 00:43:22.433
TECHNOLOGY SOLUTIONS ARE USED.

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:23.734
ABOUT HALF OF OUR CSES TODAY

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.035
THAT COULD PRE VALIDATE THOSE

00:43:25.102 --> 00:43:26.603
DOCUMENTS TO THE CUSTOMER KNOWS

00:43:26.670 --> 00:43:28.339
BEFORE THEY COME IN. THAT THEY

RIGHT DOCUMENTS- READY FOR

00:43:31.475 --> 00:43:33.277
PRESENTATION. OUR OUR GOAL IS

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:34.345
TO CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THAT

00:43:34.411 --> 00:43:35.245
PERCENTAGE OVER TIME THROUGH

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.281
MESSAGING AND CAMPAIGNS. AND

00:43:37.348 --> 00:43:39.650
INCENTIVES TO GET PEOPLE IN A

00:43:39.717 --> 00:43:42.052
DIFFERENT SPOT IN LINE- BUT YES

00:43:42.119 --> 00:43:43.053
THE REQUIREMENTS SAID TO GET A

00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:45.356
REAL ID ARE ARE. SIGNIFICANT

00:43:45.422 --> 00:43:46.623
THAT NEED TO BE ABLE TO PRODUCE

00:43:46.690 --> 00:43:48.892
DOCUMENTS BIRTH CERTIFICATES.

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.094
PASSPORTS AND SO ON MANY PEOPLE

00:43:50.160 --> 00:43:51.729
HAVE THOSE BUT NOT EVERYBODY

00:43:51.795 --> 00:43:53.197
HAS THAT READILY AVAILABLE.

00:43:53.263 --> 00:43:54.264
THERE IS A BEEN THERE HAS BEEN

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:55.566
A CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:56.633
THREE WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.102
A PHYSICAL SOCIAL SECURITY

00:43:58.168 --> 00:44:00.104
CARD. IN A NINE DIGIT SOCIAL

00:44:00.170 --> 00:44:01.438
SECURITY NUMBER. SO THAT'S

00:44:01.505 --> 00:44:03.340
GOING TO STREAMLINE THINGS SOON

00:44:03.407 --> 00:44:04.508
BECAUSE MANY OF US JUST DON'T

00:44:04.575 --> 00:44:05.542
HAVE THAT DATA AND MANY OF US

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:07.911
HAVE. THAT DATA MASK ON OUR ON

00:44:07.978 --> 00:44:10.347
OUR- YELP WELL. PACED UP AND SO

00:44:10.414 --> 00:44:11.849
ON SO IT WAS VERY HARD FOR

00:44:11.915 --> 00:44:13.217
PEOPLE TO YOU. TO PRESENT AT

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:14.084
THAT WERE STARTING TO IMPLEMENT

00:44:14.151 --> 00:44:15.652
THAT NOW THAT'LL CONTINUE TO

00:44:15.719 --> 00:44:17.755
MAKE THE- IN OFFICE AS STEP

00:44:17.821 --> 00:44:20.324
MUCH MORE. EFFICIENT I'M NOT

00:44:20.391 --> 00:44:22.393
SAYING I'M A PACK RAT BUT- THE-

00:44:22.459 --> 00:44:25.095
FOR SOME REASON I STILL HAVE MY

00:44:25.162 --> 00:44:30.034
ORIGINAL SOCIAL SECURITY CARD.

00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:31.035
THE HOBBIT. PROBABLY SOMETHING

00:44:31.101 --> 00:44:34.505
NO NEEDS TO KNOW- WHAT IS THE A

00:44:34.571 --> 00:44:36.807

THAT YOU ACTUALLY CAN DO THAT

00:44:42.479 --> 00:44:43.347

00:44:43.414 --> 00:44:44.348
TODAY WE'RE DOING A PASSWORD

00:44:44.415 --> 00:44:46.150
ERE IMPROVING THAT PROCESS NOW

00:44:46.216 --> 00:44:47.451
TO TIGHTEN THOSE CONNECTIONS A

00:44:47.518 --> 00:44:48.819
ONE PART IS FILLING OUT. THE

THE BUT BASS MIX OF FUNDING

01:01:45.768 --> 01:01:49.105

FUNDING FOR SOME OF THESE

01:01:53.843 --> 01:01:55.745
PROGRAM- BECAUSE THERE IS A

01:01:55.812 --> 01:01:57.413
NEXUS BETWEEN THAT SORT OF. IN

01:01:57.480 --> 01:01:59.649
THAT ACTIVITIES THAT ARE BEING.

DUTY AND LIGHT DUTY VEICLE-

01:02:14.497 --> 01:02:16.766
INDEX SOME OF THOSE DAYS TO

01:02:16.833 --> 01:02:19.068
INFLATION. AREN'T ANY STEP IN A

01:02:19.135 --> 01:02:21.270
LITTLE BIT MORE IT'S JUST DON'T

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:24.674
MIX OF FUNDING THAT YOU- ONE

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.709
EXAMPLE I THINK ANY WHEN I LIE

01:02:26.776 --> 01:02:32.615
AS THE USER I. O. U. WE HAVE

01:02:32.682 --> 01:02:34.517
WHICH COULD HAVE. IMPACTS ON

01:02:34.584 --> 01:02:35.585
BOTH ELECTRICITY CONSUMERS BUT

01:02:35.651 --> 01:02:37.787
ALSO HAS IMPLICATIONS ARE

01:02:37.854 --> 01:02:38.955
POTENTIALLY FOR THE STATE'S

01:02:39.021 --> 01:02:39.822
GREENHOUSE GAS AND

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:41.457
ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS AS HI

01:02:41.524 --> 01:02:42.758
ELECTRICITY RATES CAN PRESENT A

01:02:42.825 --> 01:02:45.194
BARRIER TO. SWITCHING TO

01:02:45.261 --> 01:02:46.829
ELECTRIFICATION OF VEHICLES

01:02:46.896 --> 01:02:48.831
AND- I HAVE CLIENTS THAT SO

01:02:48.898 --> 01:02:49.899
JUST KIND OF THINKING ABOUT YOU

01:02:49.966 --> 01:02:50.967
KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE BEST

01:02:51.033 --> 01:02:53.536
MIX OF FUNDING SOURCES FOR

01:02:53.603 --> 01:02:54.103
THESE PROGRAMS WE THINK IT'S

01:02:54.170 --> 01:02:57.106
IMPORTANT. SECOND WHICH PROGRAM

01:02:57.173 --> 01:02:57.707
SHOULD BE FUNDED ONCE YOU'VE

01:02:57.773 --> 01:02:59.308
IDENTIFIED WHICH- FUNDING

01:02:59.375 --> 01:03:01.277
SOURCE YOU'D LIKE TO USE.

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:03.079
IDEALLY THIS DECISION WOULD BE

01:03:03.146 --> 01:03:05.214
INFORMED BY- GOOD INFORMATION

01:03:05.281 --> 01:03:06.315
ESTIMATES ABOUT THE COST

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.350
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DIFFERENT

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:09.118
PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE MOBILE

01:03:09.185 --> 01:03:11.621
SOURCE EMISSIONS- UNFORTUNATELY

01:03:11.687 --> 01:03:14.123
THERE'S- AT THIS POINT- SOME OF

01:03:14.190 --> 01:03:15.091
THAT INFORMATION IS A LITTLE

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.559
BIT LACKING WE HAVE GOTTEN.

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:17.760
SOME INFORMATION FROM THE

01:03:17.827 --> 01:03:18.861
ADMINISTRATION THAT TRIES TO

01:03:18.928 --> 01:03:20.463
ESTIMATE THE COST EFFECTIVENESS

01:03:20.530 --> 01:03:21.764
OF DIFFERENT PROGRAMS IN THIS

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:24.100
AREA- I THINK THE BIGGEST

01:03:24.167 --> 01:03:25.234
CHALLENGE IS REALLY TRYING TO

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.235
KIND OF PUT THAT INFORMATION

01:03:26.302 --> 01:03:29.472
TOGETHER IN A WAY THAT. ALLOWS

01:03:29.539 --> 01:03:30.540
THE LEGISLATURE TO KIND OF

01:03:30.606 --> 01:03:33.242
COMPARE ACROSS PROGRAMS- IT

01:03:33.309 --> 01:03:35.077
HASN'T REALLY BEEN PRESENTED.

01:03:35.144 --> 01:03:36.145
TO US IN THAT WAY YET AND SO

01:03:36.212 --> 01:03:37.446
WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK

01:03:37.513 --> 01:03:38.581
WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TO TRY

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:39.949
TO. GATHER AND ORGANIZE

01:03:40.016 --> 01:03:42.351
INFORMATION THAT HELPS- ENOUGH

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.187
INFORM YOUR DECISIONS ABOUT

01:03:44.253 --> 01:03:45.021
WHICH PROGRAMS ARE LIKELY TO

01:03:45.087 --> 01:03:47.290
ACHIEVE A SIMILAR A QUALITY

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:47.790
CLIMATE GOALS MOST COST

01:03:47.857 --> 01:03:51.093
EFFECTIVELY- IN THE ABSENCE OF

01:03:51.160 --> 01:03:51.961
SOME OF THAT INFORMATION SOME

01:03:52.028 --> 01:03:52.962
OF THE KEY CONSIDERATIONS WE

01:03:53.029 --> 01:03:55.031
THANK OUR- WHEN THINKING ABOUT

01:03:55.097 --> 01:03:55.765
WHERE TO ALLOCATE YOUR FUNDING

01:04:02.171 --> 01:04:03.673
THINK YOU DESERVE INFORMATION

01:04:03.739 --> 01:04:05.074
LIKE IT'D BE A COAST- IN THE

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:06.776
MOBILE SOURCE WORLD TEND TO BE

01:04:06.842 --> 01:04:08.544
A LARGER SOURCE OF- GREENHOUSE

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.346
GAS EMISSIONS WERE AS HEAVY

01:04:10.413 --> 01:04:12.281
DUTY VEHICLES. ARE A LARGER

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:13.883
SOURCE OF LOCAL AIR POLLUTANTS

01:04:13.950 --> 01:04:15.017
AND SO SOME OF YOUR DECISIONS

01:04:15.084 --> 01:04:17.653
AROUND PRIORITIZATION. MIGHT

01:04:17.720 --> 01:04:18.187
DEPEND ON KIND OF HOW YOU

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:19.922
PRIORITIZE CLIMATE VERSUS AIR

01:04:19.989 --> 01:04:22.058
QUALITY GOALS IN PART. ON

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:23.292
ANOTHER ISSUE IS JUST KIND OF

01:04:23.359 --> 01:04:25.261
HOW YOU- BALANCE OF TRADE OFF

01:04:25.328 --> 01:04:26.229
BETWEEN NEAR TERM AND LONG

01:04:26.295 --> 01:04:30.399
TERM- INITIAL REDUCTIONS- YOU

01:04:30.466 --> 01:04:31.667
KNOW- TO POINT AND KIND OF

01:04:31.734 --> 01:04:33.102
EXISTING COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE

01:04:33.169 --> 01:04:35.871
TECHNOLOGIES. IS LIKELY TO

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:37.773
REDUCE EMISSIONS MORE COST

01:04:37.840 --> 01:04:38.674
EFFECTIVELY IN THE NEAR TERM

01:04:38.741 --> 01:04:40.476
BUT- I FUNDING PILOTS AND

01:04:40.543 --> 01:04:42.345
DEMONSTRATIONS CAN CAN RELATE

01:04:42.411 --> 01:04:43.946
FOR HERE YOUR LONG TERM

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:44.547
BENEFITS THAT YOU'RE PROMOTING

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:46.249
TECHNOLOGIES THAT THAT CAN BE

01:04:46.315 --> 01:04:55.558
USED. TO ACHIEVE SOME OF THEIR-

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:56.559
MORE LONG TERM GOALS. AND THEN

01:04:56.626 --> 01:04:58.527
I CAN THAT THE ONE OTHER ISSUE

01:04:58.594 --> 01:04:59.128
THAT IS FOR. RELEVANT TO THIS

01:04:59.195 --> 01:05:00.196
PROPOSAL AND THEY GOT PART. IS

01:05:00.263 --> 01:05:02.698
HOW MUCH OF. ON IF THE GOAL IS-

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:04.200
ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE AND FROM

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.401
ZERO VEHICLES HOW MUCH TO FOCUS

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:06.802
ON INCREASE. VERSUS VEHICLE

01:05:06.869 --> 01:05:07.770
INCENTIVE AND SO. BASED ON OUR

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:08.437
REVIEW OF THE LETTER WE GET

01:05:08.504 --> 01:05:09.772
THERE IS- IF THAT'S THE GOAL

01:05:09.839 --> 01:05:11.440
THAT THERE'S AN ARGUMENT FOR

01:05:11.507 --> 01:05:12.675
BOTH OF THOSE PIECES. OF

01:05:12.742 --> 01:05:14.243
SUPPORT FOR BOTH INFRASTRUCTURE

01:05:14.310 --> 01:05:18.848
AND- VEHICLE REBATES. ARE WE DO

01:05:18.914 --> 01:05:20.149
THINK THAT THERE'S A STRONG

01:05:20.216 --> 01:05:21.584
ARGUMENT THAT THERE'S LIMITED

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.686
FUNDING TO- GET SOME

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:25.454
PRIORITIZATION FOR.

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:26.722
INFRASTRUCTURE THERE'S SOME

01:05:26.789 --> 01:05:29.258
RESEARCH THAT SUGGESTS YOU KNOW

01:05:29.325 --> 01:05:29.859
IT'S AN ADDITIONAL DOLLAR FOR

01:05:29.925 --> 01:05:31.394
INFRASTRUCTURE- COULD HAVE A

01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:33.396
LITTLE BIT MORE BENEFIT THAN-

01:05:33.462 --> 01:05:34.830
FOR VEHICLE REBATES HOWEVER.

01:05:34.897 --> 01:05:36.332
THAT SAME RESEARCH ALSO SAYS

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.333
THAT BOTH ARE IMPORTANT AND

01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:38.567
THERE'S THERE ARE COMPLEMENTARY

01:05:38.634 --> 01:05:40.169
IN SOME WAYS AND SO TRYING TO

01:05:40.236 --> 01:05:40.970
FIND THAT RIGHT BALANCE IT WILL

01:05:41.037 --> 01:05:42.805
BE. ONE OF THE KEY ISSUES AND

01:05:42.872 --> 01:05:47.143
CHALLENGES. FOR THE LEGISLATURE.

01:05:47.209 --> 01:05:47.843
FINALLY OUT TRYING TO WRAP UP

01:05:47.910 --> 01:05:49.879
MY- COMMENTS HERE I DO JUST

01:05:49.945 --> 01:05:52.281
WANT TO MAKE A- VERY. MEANT OF

01:05:52.348 --> 01:05:53.249
WE HAD SOME COMMENTS

01:05:53.316 --> 01:05:54.250
RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND JUST

01:05:54.317 --> 01:05:56.519
PROPOSAL TO. ACCELERATE SOME OF

01:05:56.585 --> 01:05:57.586
THE CONTRACTS PROTECTION

01:05:57.653 --> 01:05:59.355
FUNDING THROUGH THE ISSUE OF-

01:05:59.422 --> 01:06:01.023
REVENUE BONDS AT THE ENERGY

01:06:01.090 --> 01:06:03.726
COMMISSION- JUST PICNIC SHE HAD

01:06:03.793 --> 01:06:06.062
A BASIC- CONSIDERATION AND

01:06:06.128 --> 01:06:07.396
TRADE OFF HERE IS WHETHER THAT.

01:06:07.463 --> 01:06:08.831
NEAR TERM INCREASING FUNDING

01:06:08.898 --> 01:06:09.999
THAT YOU WOULD GET CONNECTION

01:06:10.066 --> 01:06:12.001
IN THE BOND IT'S WORTH- WHICH

01:06:12.068 --> 01:06:13.235
WOULD BE UP TO A BILLION

01:06:13.302 --> 01:06:15.204
DOLLARS TO SUPPORT THE- THE

01:06:15.271 --> 01:06:16.772
REDUCTION IN FUNDING IN AND OUT

01:06:16.839 --> 01:06:18.841
YEARS AS MOST OF THE COIN

01:06:18.908 --> 01:06:19.442
TRANSPORTATION MONEY WOULD BE

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:21.911
GOING TO. PAY OFF DEBT SERVICE

01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:24.480
FROM THOSE BONDS AND SO- YOU

01:06:24.547 --> 01:06:25.781
MIGHT WANT TO EXPLORE WHAT THAT

01:06:25.848 --> 01:06:26.882
THE ADMINISTRATION SORT WHAT

01:06:26.949 --> 01:06:28.050
THEIR EXPECTATIONS ARE ABOUT

01:06:28.117 --> 01:06:29.652
LONG TERM FUNDING NEEDS AND HOW

01:06:29.719 --> 01:06:31.120
THOSE MEN NEED TO BE IN THAT.

01:06:31.187 --> 01:06:32.788
IF THIS PROPOSAL WERE TO BE TO

01:06:32.855 --> 01:06:34.590
BE ADOPTED. AND THE FINAL

01:06:34.657 --> 01:06:36.892
ISSUE- WHICH IS MAYBE A LITTLE

01:06:36.959 --> 01:06:37.860
BIT MORE TECHNICAL BUT WE THINK

01:06:37.927 --> 01:06:38.561
IT'S IMPORTANT FROM A

01:06:38.627 --> 01:06:39.595
LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT

01:06:39.662 --> 01:06:41.464
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT IS THE

01:06:41.530 --> 01:06:43.099
LEVEL OF. AUTHORITY PROVIDED TO

01:06:43.165 --> 01:06:45.034
THE ADMINISTRATION- IN

01:06:45.101 --> 01:06:47.169
PARTICULAR THE- ONE IT SHOWS

01:06:47.236 --> 01:06:49.071
THE- LEVEL OF CONTINUOUS

01:06:49.138 --> 01:06:51.307
APPROPRIATION AUTHORITY FOR.

01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.174
THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION

01:06:52.241 --> 01:06:53.709
PROGRAM WE DO THINK IT'S

01:06:53.776 --> 01:06:54.577
REASONABLE TO PROVIDE

01:06:54.643 --> 01:06:56.112
CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION

01:06:56.178 --> 01:06:57.880
AUTHORITY FOR THE- THE PIECE OF

01:06:57.947 --> 01:06:59.148
FUNDING THAT'S NEEDED TO PAY

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.716
THE DEBT SERVICE ON THE BONDS

01:07:00.783 --> 01:07:02.952
AT THAT PROPOSAL IS ADOPTED.

01:07:03.018 --> 01:07:04.987
HOWEVER WE DON'T. THINK THAT

01:07:05.054 --> 01:07:06.155
NECESSARILY ALL OF THE

01:07:06.222 --> 01:07:07.456
CONTRACTS PROTECTION FUNDING

01:07:07.523 --> 01:07:08.691
WOULD NEED TO BE CONTINUOUSLY

01:07:08.758 --> 01:07:10.159
APPROPRIATED IN ORDER TO DO

01:07:10.226 --> 01:07:12.795

THAT CONTINUOUS. APPROPRIATION

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:15.798
AUTHORITY WOULD HELP REDUCE THE

01:07:15.865 --> 01:07:17.299
BORROWING COSTS BUT WE DON'T

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.968
THINK ALL THAT NEEDS TO. TO BE

01:07:19.034 --> 01:07:21.404
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED. AND

01:07:21.470 --> 01:07:22.772
CIRCLING AND LIMITING THAT TO

01:07:22.838 --> 01:07:23.906
WHATEVER IS NEEDED WHAT HEALTH

THEY'RE TAKING TO. SERIOUSLY

01:08:23.532 --> 01:08:26.669
INVEST IN A CLEAN CAR FUTURE-

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:30.172
IT IS. IT IS OF A VISIONARY

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.741
APPROACH AND ONE THAT IS

01:08:32.808 --> 01:08:34.376
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW A

01:08:34.443 --> 01:08:37.379
LOT OF THE- CLEAN ENERGY AND

01:08:37.446 --> 01:08:40.216
SORT OF A- ENVIRONMENTAL

01:08:40.282 --> 01:08:42.084
ACTIVISTS FOCUS A LOT ON OIL

01:08:42.151 --> 01:08:44.320
PRODUCTION- HERE AND AROUND THE

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:45.754
WORLD BUT- YOU KNOW I WOULD

01:08:45.821 --> 01:08:47.490
CONTEND THAT UNLESS WE- PUT

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:49.058
SERIOUS EFFORT INTO REDUCING

01:08:49.125 --> 01:08:51.794
THE DEMAND. FOR FOSSIL FUELS-

01:08:51.861 --> 01:08:53.362
THOSE EFFORTS ARE ARE GOING TO

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.231
FALL FLAT IF WE CONTINUE TO

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:56.899
PURCHASE AND USE A GASOLINE

01:08:56.966 --> 01:08:58.501
POWERED AUTOMOBILE SO THIS IS A

01:08:58.567 --> 01:09:01.370
HUGE HUGE. A STEP AND SOMETHING

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:03.205
THAT WILL REVERBERATE THROUGH

01:09:03.272 --> 01:09:04.373
THE ENTIRE COUNTRY IF NOT THE

01:09:04.440 --> 01:09:06.308
WORLD I WE KNOW THAT THAT

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:08.577
ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN A ZERO

01:09:08.644 --> 01:09:09.945
EMISSION VEHICLES ARE OUR

01:09:10.012 --> 01:09:11.981
FUTURE AND THE CALIFORNIA IS

01:09:12.047 --> 01:09:14.950
REALLY. I THINK A OF TAKING THE

01:09:15.017 --> 01:09:17.253
LEAD IN A WORLDWIDE ON ON THIS

01:09:17.319 --> 01:09:19.955
AND SO I'M REALLY PROUD TO SEE

01:09:20.022 --> 01:09:21.223
THIS HAPPEN IN MY STATE AND BE

01:09:21.290 --> 01:09:23.058
PART OF THE CONVERSATION. I

01:09:23.125 --> 01:09:24.860
WOULD BE REMISS HOWEVER IF I

01:09:24.927 --> 01:09:25.828
DIDN'T TAKE JUST A MINUTE TO

01:09:25.895 --> 01:09:27.897
PUT A PLUG IN WELL I HAVE THE

01:09:27.963 --> 01:09:29.131
ADMINISTRATION- HOPEFULLY ON

01:09:29.198 --> 01:09:31.066
THE ON THE PHONE HERE AT LEAST

01:09:31.133 --> 01:09:32.201
ONE OF THEM TO REMIND EVERYONE

01:09:32.268 --> 01:09:34.036
THAT WHILE INVESTMENT IN CLEAN

01:09:34.103 --> 01:09:35.304
VEHICLES IS INCREDIBLY

01:09:35.371 --> 01:09:36.972
IMPORTANT AND I'M THRILLED TO

01:09:37.039 --> 01:09:38.374
SEE THE STAFF WE ALSO CAN'T

01:09:38.440 --> 01:09:40.175
REMEMBER THAT GETTING PEOPLE.

01:09:40.242 --> 01:09:41.744
OUT OF SINGLE OCCUPANCY

01:09:41.810 --> 01:09:43.946
AUTOMOBILES ALSO HAS TO BE A

01:09:44.013 --> 01:09:46.115
PRIORITY BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:09:46.181 --> 01:09:48.083
SUSTAINABLE TO FORCE EVERYBODY

01:09:48.150 --> 01:09:49.485
IN OUR COMMUNITY ALWAYS TO

01:09:49.552 --> 01:09:50.486
DRIVE EVERYWHERE IT HAS A HUGE

01:09:50.553 --> 01:09:52.321
IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO USE

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:54.223
LAND SYSTEMICALLY ON OUR

01:09:54.290 --> 01:09:56.192
ABILITY TO BUILD HOUSING. ON

01:09:56.258 --> 01:09:58.060
TRAFFIC CONGESTION QUALITY OF

01:09:58.127 --> 01:09:58.794
LIFE PUBLIC HEALTH AND

01:09:58.861 --> 01:10:00.429
EVERYTHING ELSE IN WALLS OF

01:10:00.496 --> 01:10:01.196
YOUR IMPORTANT THEY DON'T

01:10:01.263 --> 01:10:03.299
ADDRESS ANY OF THOSE ISSUES SO

01:10:03.365 --> 01:10:04.600
AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE INVEST

01:10:04.667 --> 01:10:06.602
IN CLEAN CARS WE ALSO CAN'T

01:10:06.669 --> 01:10:08.304
STOP INVESTING AND WE NEED TO.

01:10:08.370 --> 01:10:10.139
INCREASE ARE INVESTING IN WELL

01:10:10.205 --> 01:10:12.541
AS WELL IN MASS TRANSIT AND

01:10:12.608 --> 01:10:14.043
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AN ACTIVE

01:10:14.109 --> 01:10:18.547
TRANSPORTATION SO I. JUST WANT

01:10:18.614 --> 01:10:19.148
TO PUT THAT OUT THERE THAT WE

01:10:19.214 --> 01:10:19.782
SHOULD BE DOING. HOPE TO SEE IN

01:10:19.848 --> 01:10:20.215
THE FUTURE EQUAL. OF

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:22.351
INVESTMENTS AND COMMITMENTS. TO

01:10:22.418 --> 01:10:24.653
THOSE SORTS OF MODALITIES AND I

01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:25.387
WOULD SAY FOR OUR LOW INCOME

01:10:25.454 --> 01:10:27.690
COMMUNITIES. THE BEST WAY THAT

01:10:27.756 --> 01:10:29.758
WE CAN. SUPPORT THEM IS BY

01:10:29.825 --> 01:10:30.960
GIVING THEM THOSE KINDS OF

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:32.895
MOBILITY OPTIONS. BECAUSE

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:34.263
WHETHER IT'S AS EVER GASOLINE

01:10:34.330 --> 01:10:35.798
POWERED VEHICLE IT'S VERY

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:36.899
EXPENSIVE TO MAINTAIN AN

01:12:22.404 --> 01:12:24.139
THAT THERE'S A GAP SO WE NEED

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:25.708
ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND ADDITIONAL

01:12:25.774 --> 01:12:28.143

LEAD TO A BIG INFLUX OF PRIVATE

01:13:16.325 --> 01:13:18.460
SECTOR. INVESTMENTS SO OUR GOAL

01:13:18.527 --> 01:13:20.095
IS OVER TIME TO REDUCE THE

01:13:20.162 --> 01:13:22.364
PUBLIC SHARE OF HER CHARGER.

01:13:22.431 --> 01:13:26.568
INVESTMENTS AND GET TO A POINT

01:13:26.635 --> 01:13:27.069

FUNDING YOU NEED TO CLOSE THAT

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:43.919
GAP. WELL OUR ASSESSMENT IS

01:13:43.986 --> 01:13:45.754
THAT WE CAN CLOSE THE GAP WITH

01:13:45.821 --> 01:13:47.523
THAT. THREE HUNDRED MILLION.

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:50.526
OKAY GREAT- THE GOVERNOR'S

01:13:50.592 --> 01:13:52.995
PROPOSAL HAS FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

01:13:53.061 --> 01:13:53.629
FIVE MILLION FROM THE G. G. R.

TRANSPORTATION PROGRAMS AND UP

01:13:57.099 --> 01:13:58.267
TO A BILLION FROM THE CDC'S

01:13:58.333 --> 01:13:59.601
CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:01.303
FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE. I'M

01:14:03.438 --> 01:14:05.774
THOSE PROGRAMS SO THEY WORK

01:14:05.841 --> 01:14:08.510
TOGETHER WELL. THAT'S A GREAT

01:14:08.577 --> 01:14:10.345
QUESTION ONCE I START AND- THE

01:14:10.412 --> 01:14:11.580
FOLKS IN EVERY FOR SUPPORT THEY

01:14:11.647 --> 01:14:13.182
WANT AND SALAS THE PREVIOUS

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:17.119
STEP AND- SO WE ARE- WE'RE THAT

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:18.854
WE ARE LOOKING AT THESE AS-

01:14:18.921 --> 01:14:20.455
COMPLEMENTARY AND WHERE WE CAN

01:14:20.522 --> 01:14:23.025
WE ARE PARTNERING DIRECTLY. SO

01:14:23.091 --> 01:14:25.294
THAT FROM THE VIEWPOINT OF THE

01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:26.829
GRANT GEE THEY DON'T ACTUALLY

01:14:26.895 --> 01:14:28.630
IT'S- THEY DON'T SEE THAT

01:14:28.697 --> 01:14:30.065
THERE'S TO BE CONFUSED I THINK-

01:14:30.132 --> 01:14:31.667
I'M JUST APPLYING FOR A GRANT

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.101
THAT WE GIVE ME MY TRUCK AND

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.136
WOULD GIVE ME MY

01:14:34.203 --> 01:14:36.438
INFRASTRUCTURE- SO WE'RE WE'RE-

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:39.741
INTENTIONALLY PARTNERING. ON

01:14:39.808 --> 01:14:41.210
SPECIFIC- GRAHAM PROGRAMS. AND

01:14:41.276 --> 01:14:42.511
THEN THERE ARE SOME PLANS WERE

01:14:42.578 --> 01:14:43.412
JUST OTHER MAKE SENSE PARTNER

01:14:43.478 --> 01:14:44.680
WHERE WE WILL HAVE INDIVIDUAL

01:14:44.746 --> 01:14:46.148
INVESTMENTS HAPPENING YOU KNOW

01:14:46.215 --> 01:14:47.249
JUST ON THE OTHER SIDE ARE TO

01:14:47.316 --> 01:14:50.319
FUNNY. SIDE BUT OUR GOAL IS TO

01:14:50.385 --> 01:14:52.087
MAKE THIS AS SEAMLESS AS

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:54.590
POSSIBLE. FOR THE GRANT SHE

01:14:54.656 --> 01:14:57.259
COMMUNITY TO NOT FEEL LIKE-

01:14:57.326 --> 01:14:58.861
THIS IS A CDC GRANT ALL THE

01:14:58.927 --> 01:14:59.895
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS AS AN

01:14:59.962 --> 01:15:00.963
AIR BE GRANT WITH ALL THESE

01:15:01.029 --> 01:15:01.697
DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS WE

01:15:01.763 --> 01:15:02.631
REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:15:02.698 --> 01:15:04.333
THIS IS. LIKE AS EASY AS

01:15:04.399 --> 01:15:07.836
POSSIBLE. BOB FOR. FOR FOLKS TO

01:15:07.903 --> 01:15:11.807
GET GRANTS ON. BOTH THE

01:15:11.874 --> 01:15:12.407
INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE VEHICLE

01:15:12.474 --> 01:15:13.041
SIDE. GREAT THAT'S GOOD TO KNOW

01:15:13.108 --> 01:15:14.109
THAT- THAT YOU'VE ALREADY

01:15:14.176 --> 01:15:14.776
THOUGHT ABOUT THIS IN THAT

01:15:14.843 --> 01:15:15.911
YOU'RE- KIND OF BLENDING THIS

01:15:15.978 --> 01:15:17.446
TOGETHER FOR THE END USER SO

01:15:17.512 --> 01:15:19.648
THAT IS MORE SEAMLESS. I JUST A

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.084
FEW MORE QUESTIONS. SOME PEOPLE

01:15:22.150 --> 01:15:22.851
COULD ARGUE THAT THE SMOG

01:15:22.918 --> 01:15:24.353
ABATEMENT FEE IN THE VEHICLE

01:15:24.419 --> 01:15:24.953
REGISTRATION FEES ARE

01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:26.722
REGRESSIVE FEES. AND I'M

01:15:26.788 --> 01:15:28.323
WONDERING HOW WE CAN ENSURE

01:15:28.390 --> 01:15:29.591
THAT THE BENEFIT OF THE FEES

01:15:29.658 --> 01:15:31.994
CAN BE SPENT TO BENEFIT LOW

01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:35.664
INCOME CALIFORNIANS- YOU KNOW

01:15:35.731 --> 01:15:37.299
WITH HAVING A CONTINUOUSLY

01:15:37.366 --> 01:15:38.867
APPROPRIATED PROGRAMS FROM CAP

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:40.869
AND TRADE. LIMITS OUR ABILITY

01:15:40.936 --> 01:15:42.371
IN THE LEGISLATURE TO REALLY DO

01:15:42.437 --> 01:15:44.273
OVERSIGHT AND TO REFORM ANY OF

01:15:44.339 --> 01:15:46.208
THE PROGRAMS. AND I'M

01:15:46.275 --> 01:15:50.512
WONDERING- HOW. WE CAN. STILL

01:15:50.579 --> 01:15:52.514
HAVE THAT OVERSIGHT AND STILL.

01:15:52.581 --> 01:15:53.715
YOU KNOW ENSURE THAT THE

01:15:53.782 --> 01:15:55.450
PROGRAMS ARE EFFICIENT THAT

01:15:55.517 --> 01:15:56.551
THEY'RE EXACTLY WHAT WE WANT TO

01:15:56.618 --> 01:15:57.519
BE WITHOUT THEM BEING

01:15:57.586 --> 01:15:59.054
CONTINUOUSLY APPROPRIATED IF

01:15:59.121 --> 01:16:01.657
THERE'S A WAY THAT WE CAN. KIND

01:16:01.723 --> 01:16:05.060
OF MAKE THAT HAPPEN STILL. WELL

01:16:05.127 --> 01:16:06.895
THE CAN APPROPRIATIONS SO WE

01:16:06.962 --> 01:16:09.965
CAN FRONT LOAD- INVESTMENT IN

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.366
THEIR MISSION CRITICAL

01:16:11.433 --> 01:16:14.169
INFRASTRUCTURE- SO I YOU KNOW

01:16:14.236 --> 01:16:16.004
THAT'S- IT JUST IMPORTANT FOR

01:16:16.071 --> 01:16:18.307
US TO BE ABLE TO. SHOW THE

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:20.008
WORLD THAT WE ARE COMMITTED AND

01:16:20.075 --> 01:16:22.611
THAT WE ARE. OVERCOMING WHAT I

01:16:22.678 --> 01:16:23.345
WOULD ARGUE IS THE BIGGEST

01:16:23.412 --> 01:16:24.646
BARRIER TO THE

01:16:24.713 --> 01:16:25.280
COMMERCIALIZATION INTERMISSION

01:16:25.347 --> 01:16:29.017
VEHICLES- AND- BUT THERE ARE

01:16:29.084 --> 01:16:30.452
OVERSIGHT TOOL TO MAYBE I COULD

01:16:30.519 --> 01:16:31.553
SPEND JUST A FEW MINUTES.

01:16:31.620 --> 01:16:33.255

BECAUSE WHAT THE PATH RIGHT NOW

01:23:51.626 --> 01:23:53.128
IS NOT SUSTAINABLE EVEN IF

01:23:53.194 --> 01:23:54.262
EVERY CARD TOMORROW TURNED HIS

01:23:54.329 --> 01:23:55.764

OVERSIGHT THAT THIS IS A THE

01:28:54.829 --> 01:28:56.664
MASSIVE PROGRAM AND THE THERE

01:28:56.731 --> 01:28:58.466
ARE MANY ASPECTS AND GIVEN THE

01:28:58.533 --> 01:28:59.567
AMOUNT OF TIME WE HAVE HERE

01:28:59.634 --> 01:29:02.370
DURING THIS HEARING I A- WE'LL

01:29:02.437 --> 01:29:04.072
JUST FOCUS ON THIS ONE ASPECT

01:29:04.138 --> 01:29:09.177
OF IT OVERALL- HAS- ASSEMBLY

01:29:09.243 --> 01:29:10.445
MEMBER REV FRIEDMAN JUST

01:29:10.511 --> 01:29:12.513
POINTED OUT THIS IS AN EXCITING

01:29:12.580 --> 01:29:15.483
EFFORT- AND ONE THAT- CERTAINLY

01:29:15.550 --> 01:29:17.885
I THINK CITIZENS TO CALIFORNIA

01:29:17.952 --> 01:29:19.854
REALLY WELCOME. I WOULD LIKE TO

01:29:19.921 --> 01:29:21.956
CONTRAST TO SERVE PROGRAM AND

01:29:22.023 --> 01:29:23.725
THE CONTINUOUS FUNDING ASPECTS

01:29:23.791 --> 01:29:26.594
OF IT WITH THE- CAP AND TRADE

01:29:26.661 --> 01:29:28.029
PROGRAM THAT'S OUT THERE AS WE

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:29.797
LOOK AT THIS FROM OVERSIGHT. I

01:29:29.864 --> 01:29:31.733
THINK OVERALL THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:29:31.799 --> 01:29:34.469
EXPRESSING GROWING INTEREST IN

01:29:34.535 --> 01:29:37.038
MAKING SURE WE ACT EXERCISE

01:29:37.105 --> 01:29:39.407
APPROPRIATE OVERSIGHT- AS WE

01:29:39.474 --> 01:29:42.410
MOVE FORWARD AND SO MY CONCERN

01:29:42.477 --> 01:29:43.745
WAS THE CONTINUOUS FUNDING

01:29:43.811 --> 01:29:45.313
ASPECT OF THIS IS IT

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:47.381
SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES. OF THE

01:29:47.448 --> 01:29:49.951
ABILITY OF THE LEGISLATURE- TO

01:29:50.017 --> 01:29:51.018
EXERCISE ITS OVERSIGHT

01:29:51.085 --> 01:29:54.555
FUNCTION- WITH- THIS PROGRAM

01:29:54.622 --> 01:29:56.657
NOW I'VE REALIZED THAT THERE'S

01:29:56.724 --> 01:29:59.093
LESS OF AN ISSUE HERE BECAUSE

01:29:59.160 --> 01:30:00.128
IF YOU TAKE THE CAP AND TRADE

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:03.998
PROGRAM- THERE IS AN INHERENT

01:30:04.065 --> 01:30:07.135
TO PUSH- BY SIGNIFICANT FORCES

01:30:07.201 --> 01:30:10.104
TO NOT. HAVE THE ALLOWANCES BE

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:13.808
REDUCED TO- TO SORT OF TAKE

01:30:13.875 --> 01:30:15.276
ACTUALLY TO HAVE MORE LOUNGES

01:30:15.343 --> 01:30:16.477
OUT THERE WHEREAS WITH THIS

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:17.945
PROGRAM I THINK WE'RE GOING TO

01:30:18.012 --> 01:30:19.781
FIND INDUSTRIES GOING TO BE

01:30:19.847 --> 01:30:21.716
ENCOURAGING US TO. TO MAKE THE

01:30:21.783 --> 01:30:23.151
INVESTMENTS BUT THERE STILL IS

01:30:23.217 --> 01:30:25.386
A NEED I THINK WE'VE SEEN AFTER

01:30:25.453 --> 01:30:26.854
SO MANY OTHER ISSUES- THERE

01:30:26.921 --> 01:30:28.322
STILL IS A NEED FOR THE

01:30:28.389 --> 01:30:29.824
LEGISLATURE TO HAVE APPROPRIATE

01:30:29.891 --> 01:30:32.426
OVERSIGHT HERE- BECAUSE WE'VE

01:30:32.493 --> 01:30:35.196
SEEN WITH OTHER PROGRAMS. THE

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.632
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS WE DON'T

01:30:37.698 --> 01:30:39.967
WANT TO HAVE- YOU KNOW

01:30:40.034 --> 01:30:42.303
SOMETHING SOMETHING SHOW UP AND

01:30:42.370 --> 01:30:43.204
FIND THAT THERE IS A

01:30:43.271 --> 01:30:44.839
INAPPROPRIATE INFLUENCED BY

01:30:44.906 --> 01:30:47.008
SOME PEOPLE BECAUSE THESE ARE-

01:30:47.074 --> 01:30:48.810
WORK WE'RE GOING TO. BE

01:30:48.876 --> 01:30:50.211
PARTNERING WITH THE PRIVATE

01:30:50.278 --> 01:30:53.281
SECTOR- TO DECIDE THESE

01:30:53.347 --> 01:30:54.448
INVESTMENT LOCATIONS X.

01:30:54.515 --> 01:30:56.717
SENTARA- SO I'M INTERESTED IN

01:30:56.784 --> 01:30:57.985
TRYING TO MAKE SURE THE

01:30:58.052 --> 01:30:59.754
LEGISLATURE KEEPS APPROPRIATE

01:30:59.821 --> 01:31:02.557
OVERSIGHT- OF THE FINANCIAL

01:31:02.623 --> 01:31:04.158
SIDE OF THIS AND USES THE

01:31:04.225 --> 01:31:05.760
INCENTIVE OF THAT OVERSIGHT TO

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:07.094
MAKE SURE THE PROGRAM IS

01:31:07.161 --> 01:31:09.664
IMPLEMENTED- APPROPRIATELY- SO

01:31:09.730 --> 01:31:12.066
AS WE- AS WE HEARD THIS IS A

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.801
DYNAMIC AREA THINGS ARE

01:31:13.868 --> 01:31:16.470
CHANGING- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:19.974
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION- X. AND-

01:31:20.041 --> 01:31:20.541
OF FUNDS THAT ARE. WAY THAT

01:31:20.608 --> 01:31:23.244
DISK- WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S

01:31:23.311 --> 01:31:24.478
VIEW IN TERMS OF THE SAME

01:31:24.545 --> 01:31:26.881
CHANGING SO MY QUESTION- AFTER

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:30.051
SAYING ALL THIS IS- COULD YOU

01:31:30.117 --> 01:31:32.820
IDENTIFY- AND COME BACK COULD

01:31:32.887 --> 01:31:35.122
DO MINISTRATION COME BACK WITH-

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.858
A BREAK DOWN THE L. A. O. IS

01:31:36.924 --> 01:31:39.093
SUGGESTING. OF BREAKING THIS

01:31:39.160 --> 01:31:40.428
INTO A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:31:40.494 --> 01:31:42.396
DOLLAR- INVESTMENT AND THEN A

01:31:42.463 --> 01:31:43.764
SECOND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:31:43.831 --> 01:31:46.334
DOLLAR INVESTMENT- SO THAT WE

01:31:46.400 --> 01:31:48.336
HAVE LESS INTEREST COST UP

01:31:48.402 --> 01:31:49.904
FRONT BUT ALSO GIVES US AN

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:52.440
OPPORTUNITY TO. TO CHECK IT TOO

01:31:52.506 --> 01:31:54.942
TO RE EXAMINE THE PROGRAM WERE

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.244
GOING HOW THE FUNDS ARE BEING

01:31:56.310 --> 01:31:58.312
EXPANDED I WOULD LIKE TO SEE AN

01:31:58.379 --> 01:32:00.181
ADVANTAGE AND DISADVANTAGE SORT

01:32:00.248 --> 01:32:01.816
OF SHE- AS I KNOW THERE ARE

01:32:01.883 --> 01:32:03.184
SOME DISADVANTAGES OF THAT AND

01:32:03.251 --> 01:32:04.352
BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

01:32:04.418 --> 01:32:06.254
SOME ADVANTAGES TO THAT- THAT

01:32:06.320 --> 01:32:09.957
WOULD BE. HELPFUL FOR ME I

01:32:10.024 --> 01:32:11.459
WOULD ALSO BE. BENEFIT FROM

01:32:11.525 --> 01:32:13.828
UNDERSTANDING MORE HOW THE

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:15.696
PARTNERSHIPS WILL GO IN TERMS

01:32:15.763 --> 01:32:17.498
OF THE EKITI PARTNERSHIPS WITH

01:32:17.565 --> 01:32:19.634
PRIVATE INDUSTRY. FOR THE ISSUE

01:32:19.700 --> 01:32:20.568
THESE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:32:20.635 --> 01:32:22.603
INVESTMENTS TO WHAT EXTENT

01:32:22.670 --> 01:32:25.072
WILL- THE PUBLIC'S TAXPAYER

01:32:25.139 --> 01:32:30.945
DOLLARS ACTUALLY- CREATE A- UP

01:32:31.012 --> 01:32:32.980
A PUBLIC BENEFIT THAT'S NOT

01:32:33.047 --> 01:32:34.615
JUST GOING O BE SOMETHING THAT

01:32:34.682 --> 01:32:35.950
WHOEVER WE PARTNER WITH FOR THE

01:32:36.017 --> 01:32:37.952
PRIVATE- INFRASTRUCTURE

01:32:38.019 --> 01:32:40.521
INVESTMENT. DAY GAME- BUT WE

01:32:40.588 --> 01:32:41.956
HAVE SOME OTHER REQUIREMENTS IN

01:32:42.023 --> 01:32:43.491
THERE I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOU

01:32:43.557 --> 01:32:44.625
KNOW WILL ELECTRICITY RATES

01:32:44.692 --> 01:32:47.995
SHOULD BE- SUBSIDIZED IN ANYWAY

01:32:48.062 --> 01:32:49.196
FOR EXAMPLE FOR LOW INCOME

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:50.898
PEOPLE. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:52.066
THAT INFORMATION IF IT'S

01:32:52.133 --> 01:32:53.501
POSSIBLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD.

01:32:53.567 --> 01:32:54.568
THE FINAL THING I WOULD JUST

01:32:54.635 --> 01:32:57.104
OFFER I'D LIKE YOU TO-

01:32:57.171 --> 01:32:59.340
CONSIDER. IS THAT THE MIX

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:02.877
BETWEEN. WHAT WHAT WHAT WHAT

01:33:02.944 --> 01:33:04.879
ARE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES

01:33:04.946 --> 01:33:06.480
COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE OVER

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:08.482
THE NEXT TEN YEARS. AND TO

01:33:08.549 --> 01:33:09.717
CERTAINLY ELECTRICITY IS GOING

01:33:09.784 --> 01:33:11.085
TO BE A BIG PART OF IT BUT

01:33:11.152 --> 01:33:12.586
WHAT'S THE PROPER MIX BETWEEN

01:33:12.653 --> 01:33:15.022
HYDROGEN. AND ELECTRIC VEHICLES

01:33:15.089 --> 01:33:16.657
ARE IS HYDROGEN ONLY GOING TO

01:33:16.724 --> 01:33:20.394
BE- FOR HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES- IS

01:33:20.461 --> 01:33:22.063
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S PLAN

01:33:22.129 --> 01:33:23.597
THAT'S LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHERE

01:33:23.664 --> 01:33:25.433
THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOW. IN

01:33:25.499 --> 01:33:28.502
WHAT KIND OF- HOW NIMBLE THE

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.504
ADMINISTRATION THINKS WE NEED

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:34.275
TO BE FOR ADJUSTMENTS IN THE

01:33:34.342 --> 01:33:38.446
FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:33:38.512 --> 01:33:40.848
WELL ARE. THE THIRD STATUS SOME

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:42.249
OF THE QUESTIONS YOU REYES AND

01:33:42.316 --> 01:33:43.184
THEN IF I MISSED SOMETHING

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:46.754
PLEASE LET ME KNOW- SO I THINK

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.689
YOU KNOW ON THE- ON THE NEXT

01:33:48.756 --> 01:33:51.492
BETWEEN- WHAT THAT VEHICLE.

01:33:51.559 --> 01:33:52.693
FLEET COULD LOOK LIKE GOING

01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.495
FORWARD I MEAN THERE ARE CLEAR

01:33:54.562 --> 01:33:56.364
SIGNAL. GLOBALLY THAT

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.132
INVESTMENT IN BATTERY ELECTRIC

01:33:58.199 --> 01:34:00.901
VEHICLES IS THAT IS OCCURRING

01:34:00.968 --> 01:34:03.804
AND IT'S RAPID. BATTERY PRICES

01:34:03.871 --> 01:34:05.673
ARE HAVE GOT 90% OVER THE LAST

01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:08.909
TEN YEARS AND THEIR- YOU KNOW

01:34:08.976 --> 01:34:10.378
THIS IS HAPPENING NOT JUST IN

01:34:10.444 --> 01:34:12.546
THE U. S. BUT IN CHINA AND EACH

01:34:12.613 --> 01:34:14.982
YEAR IN INDIA. SO THIS IS I

01:34:15.049 --> 01:34:16.650
THINK A STOPPABLE AT THIS POINT

01:34:16.717 --> 01:34:18.319
IN TERMS OF. THAT KIND OF

01:34:18.386 --> 01:34:20.354
WRITING ON THE WALL THAT. AT

01:34:20.421 --> 01:34:21.589
LEAST ON THE BATTERY FIVE OR

01:34:21.655 --> 01:34:22.690
MAKING A LOT OF PROGRESS ON THE

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:24.425
FINANCIAL SIDE I HAVE A LONG

01:34:24.492 --> 01:34:25.826
CLOAK. ESPECIALLY IN THE MEDIUM

01:34:25.893 --> 01:34:28.662
AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. WHERE I

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:30.865
DON'T THINK BATTERIES- CAN MEET

01:34:30.931 --> 01:34:32.433
ALL THE NEEDS AND THE DUTY

01:34:32.500 --> 01:34:34.769
CYCLE. OF THE FACTORY FEELING

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.270
OF HYDROGEN THERE THERE'S JUST

01:34:36.337 --> 01:34:37.772
A LOT OF BENEFITS IT'S NOT TIME

01:34:37.838 --> 01:34:39.206
SENSITIVE INJURED I THINK.

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:41.008
THERE'S SOME SOME REAL

01:34:41.075 --> 01:34:42.543
BENEFITS- ON ON HYDROGEN SIDE

01:34:42.610 --> 01:34:43.778
AND IS THIS THE SPECIALLY I

01:34:43.844 --> 01:34:45.513
THINK IT'S AN ISSUE ON THE

01:34:45.579 --> 01:34:47.181
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY FIVE.

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.716
AGAIN WE'RE STARTING INCREASED

01:34:48.783 --> 01:34:50.484
INVESTMENT WERE NOTICING IN

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:51.919
CALIFORNIA AND THE INVESTMENTS

01:34:51.986 --> 01:34:52.653
THAT WE'RE MAKING ON THE

01:34:52.720 --> 01:34:55.122
FIELDING SIDE. THAT- THAT THE

01:34:55.189 --> 01:34:57.925
PUBLIC SHARE IS DECREASING AND

01:34:57.992 --> 01:34:59.427
THE PRIVATE SHARE IS INCREASING

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:00.995
INCRETIN FACTOR EVEN SEEING

01:35:01.062 --> 01:35:02.830
SOME HYDROGEN STATIONS BEING

01:35:02.897 --> 01:35:04.832
FULLY- FUNDED BY THE PRIVATE

01:35:04.899 --> 01:35:07.468
SECTOR. SO THERE'S GOOD SIGNS

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:08.536
ON THE HYDROGEN AND FUEL CELL

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:11.705
SIDE AS WELL- WHAT THE NEXT

01:35:11.772 --> 01:35:19.046
WILL BE YOU KNOW. WE DO

01:35:19.113 --> 01:35:20.247
INDETERMINABLE. WE DO NEED TO

01:35:20.314 --> 01:35:23.050
LIKE. ACT TO BE ABOUT. FOR

01:35:23.117 --> 01:35:24.618
WHERE MARKET. AND WHAT ARE

01:35:24.685 --> 01:35:26.520
INVEST IS EASY TO SUPPORT THAT

01:35:26.587 --> 01:35:28.089
GROWING MARKET. YEAH ARE YOU

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:30.591
FOR. GOING BIG NOW. IS THAT.

01:35:30.658 --> 01:35:32.426
THEIR MISSION VEHICLE IMPISH IF

01:35:32.493 --> 01:35:34.895
A BARRIER TO BE. A TO BUY-

01:35:34.962 --> 01:35:37.898
ANOTHER TO SEE IF. AND WHEN I

01:35:37.965 --> 01:35:39.200
SAY ELECTRIC IF YOU THE BATTERY

01:35:39.266 --> 01:35:41.035
OR FUEL CELL AFTER THEY'RE BOTH

01:35:41.102 --> 01:35:44.839
UP FOR THE TECH. AND SO

01:35:44.905 --> 01:35:45.372
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE

01:35:45.439 --> 01:35:46.707
INFRASTRUCTURE USING THE

01:35:46.774 --> 01:35:47.875
ANALYTICAL. THAT THE

01:35:47.942 --> 01:35:49.376
LEGISLATURE HAS US THE ISSUE

01:35:49.443 --> 01:35:52.079
HAS- IT'S OF THE VALUE. EVERY

01:35:52.146 --> 01:35:54.081
OTHER YEAR WHERE'S THE MARKET-

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:57.084
GOING IN TERMS OF- YOU KNOW OUR

01:35:57.151 --> 01:35:59.320
OUR- OUR THEIR MISSION VEHICLE

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:02.289
INFRASTRUCTURE. AND REALLY.

01:36:02.356 --> 01:36:08.596
RETOOLING ARE INVESTMENTS.

01:36:08.662 --> 01:36:10.364
BASED ON THAT INFORMATION- ON

01:36:10.431 --> 01:36:12.099
THE YOU KNOW THE PROPOSAL THAT

01:36:12.166 --> 01:36:13.334
THE GOVERNOR HAS MADE REALLY

01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:14.702
FOR IN A EQUITY WHICH IS A I

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:16.303
REALLY TO ONE EMPHASIZE YOUR

01:36:16.370 --> 01:36:17.271
TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW LIKE

01:36:17.338 --> 01:36:19.073
RATES LOW INCOME PEOPLE FROM MY

01:36:19.140 --> 01:36:20.975
PERSPECTIVE THANK CHALLENGES

01:36:21.041 --> 01:36:23.744
THAT WE HAVE HALF OF PEOPLE IN

01:36:23.811 --> 01:36:26.113
CALIFORNIA BRENT. 30% WITHIN

01:36:26.180 --> 01:36:28.149
MULTI FAMILY DWELLINGS IT'S NOT

01:36:28.215 --> 01:36:29.350
CONVENIENT TO BY INTERMISSION

01:36:29.416 --> 01:36:30.684
VEHICLE YOU'RE AFRAID YOU YOU

01:36:30.751 --> 01:36:32.253
CAN'T DO IT AND YOU CAN'T

01:36:32.319 --> 01:36:35.556
REFILL YOUR VEHICLE- THE

01:36:35.623 --> 01:36:37.491
ECONOMIC BENEFITS FROM HAVING

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:39.994
ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE LARGE

01:36:40.060 --> 01:36:41.061
BILL SO YOU KNOW TERM OR

01:36:41.128 --> 01:36:43.297
BETWEEN ELEVEN TO ELEVEN

01:36:43.364 --> 01:36:43.864
HUNDRED TO SEVENTEEN HUNDRED

01:36:43.931 --> 01:36:45.432
DOLLARS PER YEAR ARE THE

01:36:45.499 --> 01:36:48.035
SAVINGS FROM REDUCED FUEL COSTS

01:36:48.102 --> 01:36:49.370
WHAT COULD BE CHEAPER THAN

01:36:49.436 --> 01:36:51.405
GASOLINE. AND REDUCE

01:36:51.472 --> 01:36:52.406
MAINTENANCE COSTS SO WE WANT TO

01:36:52.473 --> 01:36:53.807
MAKE SURE THAT LOW INCOME

01:36:53.874 --> 01:36:57.077
FAMILIES CAN BENEFIT FROM THE

01:36:57.144 --> 01:36:58.812
LOWER LIFE CYCLE CSTS THE

01:36:58.879 --> 01:37:00.848
BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND TO

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:02.650
DO THAT WE NEED INFRASTRUCTURE

01:37:02.716 --> 01:37:03.784
WE KNOW A LOT OF INFRASTRUCTURE

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:05.619
AND WE NEED IT NOW SO THERE'S

01:37:05.686 --> 01:37:07.354
THIS. THAT'S THE REASON WE'RE

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:08.789
GOING BIG WITH THIS BILLION

01:37:08.856 --> 01:37:10.090
DOLLAR PROPOSAL IT'S SO THAT WE

01:37:10.157 --> 01:37:12.927
CAN OVERCOME THIS MAJOR

01:37:12.993 --> 01:37:14.695
BARRIERS TO DEPLOYMENT OF ZERO

01:37:14.762 --> 01:37:15.863
EMISSION VEHICLES AND MAKE SURE

01:37:15.930 --> 01:37:22.970
THAT EVERYBODY BENEFITS. AND

01:37:23.037 --> 01:37:23.504
ESPECIALLY IF YOU'RE A LOW

01:37:23.571 --> 01:37:24.738
INCOME FAMILY. IF I COULD FOR

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:28.676
UP UP WITH A HI LIZ CAREFULLY-

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:31.445
TWO YEAR AND- EARLIER- FROM OF

01:37:31.512 --> 01:37:32.947
TO THE FROM SAN MEMBER FOR. A

01:37:33.013 --> 01:37:36.517
SORT OF OVER. AND IT AND THE AS

01:37:36.584 --> 01:37:38.452
A LIST DOLLARS THEY THEY WERE

01:37:38.519 --> 01:37:41.021
ALL WERE PRO. AND THEY WERE ALL-

01:37:41.088 --> 01:37:44.692
HEALTHY- OVERSIGHT ACTIVE. BUT

01:37:44.758 --> 01:37:48.195
I FELT A LITTLE BIT LIKE WHEN I

01:37:48.262 --> 01:37:49.563
LISTEN TO SOME A. R. B. THINGS

01:37:49.630 --> 01:37:50.831
THERE THERE WAS A REPORT A. R.

01:37:50.898 --> 01:37:52.132
B. HAD TO GIVE A REPORT TO THE

01:37:52.199 --> 01:37:54.001
LEGISLATURE AND THEY AND THEY

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:54.835
DID GIVE A REPORT TO THE

01:37:54.902 --> 01:37:56.470
LEGISLATURE BUT WHEN THE

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.439
REPORTS SAID THEY WEREN'T GOING

01:37:58.505 --> 01:38:00.174
TO BE MAKING ANY MODIFICATIONS

01:38:00.241 --> 01:38:02.009
IT WAS LIKE EVERYTHING FELL

01:38:02.076 --> 01:38:04.578
FLAT BECAUSE- OF THEY WERE

01:38:04.645 --> 01:38:06.814
GOING TO BE CHANGING HOW THEY

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:09.550
WERE OPERATING SO WHILE THOSE

01:38:09.617 --> 01:38:11.819
ARE. CERTAINLY APPROPRIATE I

01:38:11.885 --> 01:38:12.486
DON'T KNOW IF THEY'RE

01:38:12.553 --> 01:38:14.288
SUFFICIENT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:17.124
TO HAVE THAT SENSE OF- HEY WE

01:38:17.191 --> 01:38:19.560
WANT TO WE WANT TO HAVE A VOICE

01:38:19.627 --> 01:38:21.328
IN MODIFYING OR CHANGING THIS

01:38:21.395 --> 01:38:25.099
PROGRAM AS IT GOES FORWARD SO-

01:38:25.165 --> 01:38:26.800
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE- THAT

01:38:26.867 --> 01:38:28.502
YOU HAVE SOME AND HOPE THAT WE

01:38:28.569 --> 01:38:29.837
COULD FIND SOME WAYS TO HAVE

01:38:37.177 --> 01:38:40.314
THE MIX AND THE CHARGING I WANT

01:38:40.381 --> 01:38:41.815
TO POINT OUT THAT. ONE OF MY

01:38:41.882 --> 01:38:44.118
CONCERNS HERE IS IT TAKES

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.286
THIRTY MINUTES RIGHT NOW IN

THIRTY MINUTES AFTER YOU GET

01:38:58.299 --> 01:39:00.401

01:46:27.714 --> 01:46:29.616
VEHICLES. HAVE YOU CONSULTED

01:46:29.683 --> 01:46:30.917
WITH THE INDUSTRY AND WHAT IS

01:46:30.984 --> 01:46:32.886
THEIR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:35.722
APPEARS TO BE AN EFFORT TO

01:46:35.789 --> 01:46:38.692
TERMINATE THE CVR P. PROGRAM.

01:46:38.759 --> 01:46:40.494
I'M SURE HEARING- VERY SIMILAR

01:46:40.560 --> 01:46:42.295
THINGS TO YOU ARE OF COURSE- I

01:46:42.362 --> 01:46:44.698
SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET-

01:46:44.765 --> 01:46:45.699
BUT OF COURSE WE DO HEAR FROM

01:46:45.766 --> 01:46:47.501
MANUFACTURERS OF BOTH THE LIGHT

01:46:47.567 --> 01:46:49.469
MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. OF

01:46:49.536 --> 01:46:50.637
COURSE THAT THAT INCENTIVES

01:46:50.704 --> 01:46:51.705
PLAYED IMPORTANT ROLES A

01:46:51.772 --> 01:46:53.373
COMPLIMENT TO GET EARLY

01:46:53.440 --> 01:46:54.241
REDUCTIONS TO MEET OUR

01:46:54.307 --> 01:46:56.676
REGULATIONS SO WHILE WHILE I

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:59.412
HAVE YOU- I THINK A OR B. AS

01:46:59.479 --> 01:47:03.283
THE RIGHT. TO AGENCY TO ANSWER

01:47:03.350 --> 01:47:07.387
THIS QUESTION- WE HAVE TO.

01:47:07.454 --> 01:47:09.689
MAJOR FUELING SOURCES FOR THE

01:47:09.756 --> 01:47:11.792
VEHICLES WE HAVE A LECTURE

01:47:11.858 --> 01:47:14.661
VEHICLES WITH HYDROGEN-

01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:18.865
HYDROGEN BY COMPARISON TO. A

01:47:18.932 --> 01:47:20.801
LECTURE GOOD OF VEHICLES IS

01:47:20.867 --> 01:47:22.803
STILL AN INDUSTRY THAT'S IN ITS

01:47:22.869 --> 01:47:26.573
INFANCY AND THE TECHNOLOGY IS

01:47:26.640 --> 01:47:28.575
MOVING FORWARD- AND IN SOME

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:32.279
WAYS DRAMATICALLY BUT BUT- I

01:47:32.345 --> 01:47:35.015
THINK STILL SOMEWHAT BEHIND IN

01:47:35.081 --> 01:47:38.318
TERMS OF ITS MATURATION COMPARE

01:47:38.385 --> 01:47:44.558
TO- OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES- WE'VE

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:47.494
PROVIDED BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF

01:47:47.561 --> 01:47:49.429
INCENTIVES AND BENEFITS AND-

01:47:49.496 --> 01:47:52.299
FUNDING. FOR THE ELECTRIC SIDE

01:47:52.365 --> 01:47:53.867
BUT COMPARATIVELY I'M NOT

01:47:53.934 --> 01:47:55.202
SAYING IT'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF

01:47:55.268 --> 01:47:58.772
MONEY BUT COMPARATIVELY LITTLE-

01:47:58.839 --> 01:48:02.042
FOR HYDROGEN AND I NOTE IN- OF

01:48:02.108 --> 01:48:04.978
THE PROPOSED BUDGET- IT SEEMS

01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:07.214
TO BE A MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.116
TO IN TERMS OF. OF THE AMOUNT

01:48:10.183 --> 01:48:13.587
OF MONEY THAT IS BUDGET-

01:48:13.653 --> 01:48:15.388
FUELING CUT HYDROGEN FUELING

01:48:15.455 --> 01:48:18.558
INFRASTRUCTURE- IS IN A PLACE

01:48:18.625 --> 01:48:20.961
WHERE IT NEEDS TO CATCH UP JUST

01:48:21.027 --> 01:48:24.397
LIKE WITH- OF LECTURE CUT. A

01:48:24.464 --> 01:48:29.102
FUELING STATIONS WE NEED- MORE

01:48:29.169 --> 01:48:31.238
UBIQUITOUS SET UP FUELING

01:48:31.304 --> 01:48:33.773
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR HYDROGEN AND

01:48:33.840 --> 01:48:35.075
THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF WORK

01:48:35.141 --> 01:48:38.511
BEING DONE TO- ADVANCED

01:48:38.578 --> 01:48:39.546
HYDROGEN SO THAT IT IS IN FACT

01:48:39.613 --> 01:48:44.184
A- THE- THE HYDROGEN ITSELF IS

01:48:44.251 --> 01:48:47.621
SUSTAINABLY PRODUCED- SO WHY

01:48:47.687 --> 01:48:48.355
THESE ARE THE TWO MAJOR

01:48:48.421 --> 01:48:50.457
BARRIERS I THINK- IN TERMS OF

01:48:50.523 --> 01:48:52.392
MOVING THAT TECHNOLOGY FORWARD

01:48:52.459 --> 01:48:55.228
WHY IS THERE NO INCREASE- THIS

01:48:55.295 --> 01:48:59.466
YEAR- IN- THE HYDROGEN SECTOR-

01:48:59.532 --> 01:49:01.768
PARTICULARLY WHEN WE COMPARE IT

01:49:01.835 --> 01:49:04.137
TO WHAT IS PROPOSED. FOR

01:49:04.204 --> 01:49:07.607
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. ASSEMBLY

01:49:07.674 --> 01:49:09.743
MEMBER ILET ME- I WOULD

01:49:09.809 --> 01:49:12.012
RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION A

01:49:12.078 --> 01:49:16.249
CHARGER. SO THE EVERY PERSON

01:49:16.316 --> 01:49:18.151
BOARD AT ITS MORE ON THE

01:49:18.218 --> 01:49:20.153
VEHICLES WERE MORE THAT IN AND

01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.621
SITE SO LET ME TO TALK ABOUT

01:49:21.688 --> 01:49:24.224
SOME OF THE- WAYS WERE.

01:49:24.291 --> 01:49:26.426
HYDROGEN RIGHT NOW. THE AB

01:49:26.493 --> 01:49:28.929
EIGHT REQUIRE US START- YOU

01:49:28.995 --> 01:49:30.897
KNOW THAN TWENTY. OF THE FUNDS

01:49:30.964 --> 01:49:33.033
TOWARDS A PUBLICLY AVAILABLE

01:49:33.099 --> 01:49:36.002
HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE UP TO

01:49:36.069 --> 01:49:37.337
HUNDRED STATIONS ARE WE'RE

01:49:37.404 --> 01:49:39.539
ACTUALLY IN OUR- OUR OUR PLAN

01:49:39.606 --> 01:49:41.775
IS TO GO. BEYOND A HUNDRED

01:49:41.841 --> 01:49:44.644
STATION AND WE'RE- WITH THAT

01:49:44.711 --> 01:49:46.313
STATED THAT WE ARE FUNDING AND

01:49:46.379 --> 01:49:47.681
WHAT'S FUNDED BY PRIVATE

01:49:47.747 --> 01:49:50.116
INDUSTRY WE'RE EXPECTING A

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:51.084
HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE STATIONS

01:49:51.151 --> 01:49:53.653
WILL BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE-

01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:56.089
AND- THEN THOSE STATIONS WILL

01:49:56.156 --> 01:49:58.391
FUND WILL SUPPORT AT LEAST A

01:49:58.458 --> 01:49:58.925
HUNDRED THOUSAND PROBABLY

01:49:58.992 --> 01:50:00.560
CLOSER TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:50:00.627 --> 01:50:01.761
SHALL SELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES.

01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:03.730
BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN ST IT

01:50:03.797 --> 01:50:05.632
IS EXPECTING ABOUT FIFTY

01:50:05.699 --> 01:50:07.300
THOUSAND FUEL CELL VEHICLE SO

01:50:07.367 --> 01:50:09.836
WE SHOULD HAVE A INFRASTRUCTURE

01:50:09.903 --> 01:50:12.539
TO FAR EXCEED WHAT THE-

01:50:12.605 --> 01:50:14.207
MANUFACTURERS SAY IT'S GOING TO

01:50:14.274 --> 01:50:15.608
BE AVAILABLE ON THE FUEL PUMP

01:50:15.675 --> 01:50:21.548
SIDE ON BY TO THE VEHICLES. IN

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:22.082
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. WE ARE

01:50:22.148 --> 01:50:24.985
USING OUR FIVE TO SIT BOTH-

01:50:25.051 --> 01:50:26.519
ZERO CARBON HYDROGEN PRODUCTION.

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:27.921
AND TO SOME MEDIUM AND HEAVY.

01:50:27.988 --> 01:50:31.224
STILL SOME ALSO- THEY SAID

01:50:31.291 --> 01:50:32.592
BEFORE THAT A FACTOR I THINK

01:50:32.659 --> 01:50:35.128
YOU KNOW. WE REALLY NEED. A

01:50:35.195 --> 01:50:35.929
BATTERY LIFE FOR AND FUEL CELL

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:38.865
ELECTRIC THE TO- TO HELP US.

01:50:38.932 --> 01:50:40.900
ACHIEVE OUR GOAL. ARE FULLY

FIRST AND I THINK YOU POINTED

01:50:45.905 --> 01:50:48.208
OUT FROM SO IT WE FEEL IT CAN

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:49.709
BE. THERE'S A LOT OF THE DAMAGE

01:50:49.776 --> 01:50:52.846
TIGER- AND WE ARE SUPPORTING

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:59.652
WITH OUR FUNDS BOTH. JUST

01:50:59.719 --> 01:51:01.788
ELECTRIC VEHICLES. HEARD OF THE

01:51:01.855 --> 01:51:05.492
THANK YOU MISTER TEN. THANK ME

01:51:05.558 --> 01:51:08.461
TO CHURCH A COUPLE- THAN ANY OF

01:51:08.528 --> 01:51:12.065
IN THE FIVE. FROM THE MYSTERY

01:51:12.132 --> 01:51:15.769
COULD ANSWER I. GOING BACK- TO

01:51:15.835 --> 01:51:19.672
THE- AGENDA- THE DOCUMENT I

01:51:19.739 --> 01:51:22.475
THINK OF INFORMATION FROM THE-

01:51:22.542 --> 01:51:25.111
RESOURCES BOARD- WE GO THAT

01:51:25.178 --> 01:51:26.946
TRANSPORTATION IS 40% OF

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:29.215
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN

01:51:29.282 --> 01:51:29.949
THAT PASSENGER VEHICLES ARE

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:32.519
ABOUT. 80% OF THAT

01:51:32.585 --> 01:51:34.888
TRANSPORTATION'S GREENHOUSE GAS

01:51:34.954 --> 01:51:37.090
EMISSIONS SO WHY FIVE JUST

01:51:37.157 --> 01:51:38.358
GOING BACK TO MY COLLEAGUES

01:51:38.425 --> 01:51:40.460
QUESTION WHY WAS THERE NO

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:43.530
FUNDING FOR THE CLEAN VEHICLE

01:51:43.596 --> 01:51:48.668
REBATE PROGRAM AND THE PROPOSAL.

01:51:48.735 --> 01:51:50.403

WE DO UNDERSTAND THE

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:55.475
LEGISLATURE. IN THIS PROGRAM

01:51:55.542 --> 01:51:56.743
WHAT ARE THE EXPENDITURE PLAN

01:51:56.810 --> 01:51:58.478
INCLUDES FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

01:51:58.545 --> 01:51:59.279
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING

01:51:59.345 --> 01:52:00.680
FOR CLEAN VEHICLE PROGRAMS THAT

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:01.614
FOCUS ON LOW INCOME

01:52:01.681 --> 01:52:03.650
CALIFORNIANS AND REDUCING AIR

01:52:03.716 --> 01:52:04.818
POLLUTION FROM HEAVY DUTY

01:52:04.884 --> 01:52:05.985
VEHICLES AND DISADVANTAGED

01:52:06.052 --> 01:52:07.921
COMMUNITIES SO THAT IS WHERE.

01:52:07.987 --> 01:52:08.955
BASED ON THE LIMITED FUNDING

01:52:09.022 --> 01:52:10.657
THAT WE HAVE THAT IS WHERE WE

01:52:10.723 --> 01:52:12.725
HAVE PROPOSED TO ALLOCATE.

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:15.929
THESE DOLLARS. SO THAT THERE IS

01:52:15.995 --> 01:52:18.331
THERE IS A DECISION MAKE. TO

01:52:18.398 --> 01:52:19.799
MOVE THE MONEY FROM C. B. R. P.

01:52:19.866 --> 01:52:20.934
AND OTHER PEOPLE CAN YOU TELL

WHERE THE MONEY'S GETTING MOVED

01:52:23.736 --> 01:52:28.308
TO. CERTAINLY SO WE DO NOT VIEW

01:52:28.374 --> 01:52:30.009
THIS DOES THAT NECESSARILY

01:52:30.076 --> 01:52:32.011
MOVING BUT- WE HAVE NOT MADE A

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.646
DOLLAR THIRTY PLUS BUT YOU JUST

01:52:33.713 --> 01:52:35.849
SAID YOU SAID LIMITED DOLLARS.

TO DO THAT IN A COUPLE

02:02:38.718 --> 02:02:40.619
DIFFERENT WAYS. ONE IS TO

02:02:40.686 --> 02:02:41.987
EXPAND THE FIFTH US OF THE

02:02:42.054 --> 02:02:43.956
ECOLOGY I. P. PROGRAM. WHICH

02:02:44.023 --> 02:02:45.591
USES A LOT OF ANALYSIS FIFTY

02:02:45.658 --> 02:02:47.126
WHERE THERE'S GAPS. THROUGHOUT

02:02:47.193 --> 02:02:48.994
THE STATE AND THEN WE GO OUT WE

02:02:49.061 --> 02:02:50.496
TARGET THOSE GOT. TO MEET FOR

02:02:50.563 --> 02:02:51.964
THE ENTIRE STATE HAS A MINIMUM

02:02:52.031 --> 02:02:54.133
FLOOR OF ACCESS. AND EVEN

02:02:54.200 --> 02:02:55.935
WITHIN THAT WE HAVE EQUITY GOAL

02:02:56.001 --> 02:02:58.270
THAT WE MARK IT. UP TRUST

02:02:58.337 --> 02:03:00.339
BECAUSE ONE NOT- BUT WE WANT TO

02:03:00.406 --> 02:03:01.607
GO EVEN FURTHER THIS IS ONE

02:03:01.674 --> 02:03:03.409
CHALLENGE WHERE. WITH A HUNDRED

02:03:03.476 --> 02:03:04.844
MILLION DOLLARS PER YEAR WHICH

02:03:04.910 --> 02:03:06.946
WE HAVE NOW WHICH IS A LOT OF

02:03:07.012 --> 02:03:08.047
MONEY THERE'S NO DOUBT ABOUT

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:13.486
THAT. IT DOES LIMIT HOW WE MAKE

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:14.587
OUR INVESTMENT. BECAUSE WE DO

02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:16.889
HAVE TO TRADE BETWEEN DUTY. AND

02:03:16.956 --> 02:03:18.090
MEDIUM DUTY HEAVY DUTY. WHAT IF

02:03:18.157 --> 02:03:20.259
I JUST FUNDING ON THE LIGHT

02:03:20.326 --> 02:03:20.860
FIVE. WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD. A

02:03:20.926 --> 02:03:21.994
MULTI MULTIPLE YOUR DWELLINGS

02:03:22.061 --> 02:03:24.163
ARE MODEST. TOOK THE TAPES AND

02:03:24.230 --> 02:03:25.397
WHICH WE WANT TO DO WHEN WE'RE

02:03:25.464 --> 02:03:26.532
WORKING RIGHT NOW TO MOVE THAT

02:03:26.599 --> 02:03:28.467
FORWARD. TO REALLY TARGET THAT

02:03:28.534 --> 02:03:30.836
TALK EVERY SEGMENT. IN M. U. D.

02:03:30.903 --> 02:03:32.071
WERE RENTERS OFTEN WHAT. WE'RE

02:03:32.138 --> 02:03:33.806
ALSO GOING TO LAUNCH THE RURAL

02:03:33.873 --> 02:03:36.742
COMMUNITIES. PROGRAM TO FOCUS

02:03:36.809 --> 02:03:37.877
ON RURAL COMMUNITIES BECAUSE

02:03:37.943 --> 02:03:39.378
AGAIN WE KNOW THAT THE AREA.

02:03:39.445 --> 02:03:41.413
WHAT WE CAN DO MORE. AND WE

02:03:41.480 --> 02:03:43.215
ALSO LOOK INTO POTENTIALLY WANT

02:03:43.282 --> 02:03:45.951
SOMETHING. ON HIGH MILEAGE

02:03:46.018 --> 02:03:47.920
VEHICLES LIKE TNCS. AND REALLY

02:03:47.987 --> 02:03:49.655
IT'S A PORTFOLIO APPROACH TO

02:03:49.722 --> 02:03:51.824
TAKE WHAT WORKING BUT THAT ALSO

02:03:51.891 --> 02:03:52.958
TARGET AREAS WHERE WE NEED MORE

02:03:53.025 --> 02:03:55.828
WORK- SO KNOW THAT THAT'S A LOT

02:03:55.895 --> 02:03:56.629
MORE I THINK THE GRANULAR

02:03:56.695 --> 02:03:57.763
THING. HOPEFUL THAT YOU'RE

THE GAPS. I'M SORRY NO GO AHEAD

02:04:07.173 --> 02:04:09.742
PLEASE. A THIRD ON THE HUNDRED

02:04:09.809 --> 02:04:11.844
SIDE WITH TO GO ABOUT TWO ONE-

STATION FOR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE

02:04:12.645 --> 02:04:13.546
AND- WE THE JUST FUNDING WOULD

02:04:13.612 --> 02:04:15.447
BE UPLOAD THAT GAP WE ISSUED A

02:04:15.514 --> 02:04:17.883
NOTICE PROPOSED AND NOVA WHICH

02:04:17.950 --> 02:04:21.020
INDICATES- STATIONED YOU MEET

02:04:21.086 --> 02:04:22.254
OUR CRITERIA THAT WE COULD

02:04:22.321 --> 02:04:27.026
CONTINUE TO FUND DOWN. AND

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:27.660
DEPLOY MORE THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:04:27.726 --> 02:04:28.961
OVER TIME. AND THEN ALSO SEE.

02:04:29.028 --> 02:04:29.562
THEM MEAT IN DUE TO HAVE DUTY

02:04:29.628 --> 02:04:31.630
MARK. AND WHAT I MEAN BY THAT

02:04:31.697 --> 02:04:33.732
IS THAT THE AREA THAT AGAIN

02:04:33.799 --> 02:04:34.667
YEAH I THINK WE ALL KNOW THAT

02:04:34.733 --> 02:04:36.168
IT'S ALREADY BEEN SAID. BUT FOR

02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:37.036
A LOT OF THE DIESEL EMISSIONS

02:04:37.102 --> 02:04:38.938
COME FROM THAT'S WHERE YOU HAVE

02:04:39.004 --> 02:04:40.873
A CUTE EQUITY ISSUES AND

02:04:40.940 --> 02:04:42.708
FRANKLY. PEOPLE DIE FROM THAT

02:04:42.775 --> 02:04:44.043
RIGHT THIS CAUSES CANCER THIS

02:04:44.109 --> 02:04:45.511
BECAUSE OF THE HOUSE NOT THIS

02:04:45.578 --> 02:04:47.279
IS AN AREA. THAT WE DEFINITELY

02:04:47.346 --> 02:04:48.681
WANT TO TARGET AND THE MARKET

02:04:48.747 --> 02:04:50.282
IS COMING DOWN. TO A PLACE

02:04:50.349 --> 02:04:51.984
WHERE FIFTY DIFFERENT AND WE

02:04:52.051 --> 02:04:53.619
CAN BE RISKY. YEAH ONE THING

02:04:53.686 --> 02:04:55.354
THAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT A

02:04:55.421 --> 02:04:56.922
LOT OF TIMES THE BUSINESSES.

02:04:56.989 --> 02:04:59.825
AND LARGER COMPANIES THEY HAVE

02:04:59.892 --> 02:05:00.860
MANDATE RIGHT AND THEY'LL DO

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:02.628
THEM BUT THEY MIGHT WAIT UNTIL

02:05:02.695 --> 02:05:04.496
LATER IN THE GAME TO ACHIEVE

02:05:04.563 --> 02:05:06.432
THE TARGET BECAUSE- THEY'RE

02:05:06.498 --> 02:05:08.167
WORRIED THEY HAVE AGGRESSIVE IN

02:05:08.234 --> 02:05:09.702
MAKING SOME DISCOMFORT THAT.

02:05:09.768 --> 02:05:11.737
YOU KNOW IF YOUR UPS DELIVERY

02:05:11.804 --> 02:05:13.339
VEHICLE OR TRANSPORTATION THE

02:05:13.405 --> 02:05:18.844
PRIMARY PURPOSE IS. TO DELIVER

02:05:18.911 --> 02:05:20.579
PACKAGES. LAURENT GIVE

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:22.615
INVESTMENT CAN REALLY HELP REST.

02:05:22.681 --> 02:05:25.084
OF THEM. THAT HELP THEM ADOPT

02:05:25.150 --> 02:05:25.684
YOU KNOW CAN'T PULL AND THEN

02:05:25.751 --> 02:05:27.486
MORE AND MORE. VEHICLES BOTH A

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:29.121
LOT. AND HYDROGEN. TO THE POINT

02:05:29.188 --> 02:05:30.122
WHERE THEY COMP. THAT ONE IT

02:05:30.189 --> 02:05:31.891
WILL FOR THE ROCK. THANK THANK

NUMBER HEARD WAS THOUSAND

02:05:35.794 --> 02:05:37.963
CHARGER. SO DOING DOLLARS FOR

02:05:38.030 --> 02:05:38.564
FIFTY THOUSAND CHARGERS WORKS

02:05:38.631 --> 02:05:39.999
OUT TO BE WHAT ABOUT TWENTY

02:05:40.065 --> 02:05:41.567
THOUSAND DOLLARS A CHARGER. IS

02:05:41.634 --> 02:05:42.468
THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE

02:05:42.534 --> 02:05:44.370
ANTICIPATING SUBSIDIZING SARDIS

02:05:44.436 --> 02:05:48.207
ALL LEVEL. THREE CHARGERS THAT

02:05:48.274 --> 02:05:49.441
YOU'RE PLANNING TO SUBSIDIZE. I

02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:50.342
THINK YOU'VE GOT A GREAT

02:05:50.409 --> 02:05:53.279
QUESTION- SO KELLY THE I. P. WE

02:05:53.345 --> 02:05:54.947
IS OUR PRIMARY LIGHT DUTY-

02:05:55.014 --> 02:05:56.916
PROGRAM WHICH DOES BOTH LEVEL

02:05:56.982 --> 02:05:58.484
TWO AND DC I THINK. AND IN THE

02:05:58.550 --> 02:06:01.387
PAST IT WAS ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE

02:06:01.453 --> 02:06:02.388
HUNDRED DOLLAR INVESTMENT ON

02:06:02.454 --> 02:06:04.290
LEVEL TWO THE PUBLIC DOLLAR THE

02:06:04.356 --> 02:06:05.991
PRIVATE SECTOR PICKED UP ABOUT.

02:06:06.058 --> 02:06:07.626
WE'VE GONE DOWN TO FORTY FIVE

02:06:07.693 --> 02:06:08.494
HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR LEVEL TWO

02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:09.828
CHARGER AND WE'RE GONNA

02:06:09.895 --> 02:06:11.330
PROPOSED EVEN GO FURTHER DOWN

02:06:11.397 --> 02:06:13.132
THE CARE. SHOWN TO TRANSITION

02:06:13.198 --> 02:06:15.000
FOR MORE MORE PRIVATE FUNDING

02:06:15.067 --> 02:06:17.670
ABOUT 66% OF THE LEVEL TWO

02:06:17.736 --> 02:06:19.538
CHARGER IT PAID WORK FOR

02:06:19.605 --> 02:06:22.141
SOMETHING IF FOUR. OUTSIDE THE

02:06:22.207 --> 02:06:27.579
MARKET HE WON WE FUNDING SO.

02:06:27.646 --> 02:06:28.180
ARE WE GETTING MORE THAN FIFTY

02:06:28.247 --> 02:06:29.281
THOUSAND CHARGERS. SO THAT THE

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:30.816
WAY WE DID THE ANALYSIS TO LOOK

02:06:30.883 --> 02:06:32.284
AT HOW WE COVER THAT FIFTY TWO

02:06:32.351 --> 02:06:33.986
THOUSAND. GAP WITH A THREE

PORTSMOUTH FOR LEVEL TWO PORT A

02:06:36.622 --> 02:06:38.090
PRETTY FAIR ENOUGH FOR THE FOUR

KEEP OUR FUNDING. FOR THE WORK

02:06:43.495 --> 02:06:47.032
THEY DON'T KNOW HOW. LONG BUT

02:06:47.099 --> 02:06:47.566
WORTHY OF THE NINE HUNDRED

02:06:47.633 --> 02:06:51.203
MILLION GOING. SO THE- OTHER

02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:52.471
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION. THREE

WANT TO LIVE UPON ONE POINT

02:08:07.179 --> 02:08:09.715
THREE MILLION YEAR HER YEARS OF

02:08:09.782 --> 02:08:10.282
THE STATION TO THE COME WITH

THE COME WITH THE POWER PLANT

02:08:11.617 --> 02:08:14.887
TO. I WILL SAY THIS WHICH IS

02:08:14.953 --> 02:08:17.089
REALLY ENCOURAGING HOW QUICKLY

02:08:17.156 --> 02:08:19.458
IN THE PAST WE PAY 430% I'M

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:21.193
SORRY 5070% OF THE HUNDRED

02:08:21.260 --> 02:08:23.595
STATES AND WE'RE NOT FIFTY

02:08:23.662 --> 02:08:24.196

TAKING THAT HAVE EVEN MORE

02:08:25.597 --> 02:08:26.865
CAPACITY THAN THEY DID IN THE

02:08:26.932 --> 02:08:28.333
PAST WHAT WE'RE SEEING AT

02:08:28.400 --> 02:08:31.870
HIGHER CAPACITY STATION. WITH

DEFINITELY NOW SOME DEGREE FROM

02:08:50.189 --> 02:08:52.324
MY COLLEAGUE FROM- IN A

02:08:52.391 --> 02:08:53.592
GLENDALE THAT THE TIME IS

02:08:53.659 --> 02:08:55.861
DEFINITELY NOW TO BE INVESTING

02:08:55.928 --> 02:08:59.164

DOLLARS AND THE ANSWER SEEMS TO

02:09:13.378 --> 02:09:15.247
HAVE CHANGED BY THE MINUTE- I

02:09:15.314 --> 02:09:16.014
DON'T KNOW THAT WE COULD

02:09:16.081 --> 02:09:17.516
APPROVE THAT SO LET ME LET ME

02:09:17.583 --> 02:09:22.354
JUST GO TO- THE TWO BUCKETS-

02:09:22.421 --> 02:09:24.289
THAT MY COLLEAGUE FROM VENTURA

02:09:24.356 --> 02:09:26.425

FIFTY MILLION FOR TWO YEARS

02:09:35.901 --> 02:09:36.468
OVER THE TRANSPORTATION EQUITY

PROGRAMS. ON OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW

02:09:39.671 --> 02:09:40.439
THAT THE WORD EQUITY'S BEEN

02:09:40.506 --> 02:09:42.641
MENTIONED QUITE A BIT AND FOR

02:09:42.708 --> 02:09:44.309
ME OBVIOUSLY IT MYSELF A LOT OF

02:09:44.376 --> 02:09:46.178
OUR COLLEAGUES. THE VERY

02:09:46.245 --> 02:09:48.247
SENSITIVE POINT THE THINK A LOT

OF OUR COMMUNITIES FEEL LIKE

02:09:49.014 --> 02:09:51.216
THEY THEY HAVEN'T GOT ANY ANY

02:09:51.283 --> 02:09:52.751
BENEFIT FROM THESE PROGRAMS SO

02:09:52.818 --> 02:09:55.621
WE DO APPRECIATE THAT THERE IS.

02:09:55.687 --> 02:09:57.289
A KNOWLEDGE MENT OF THAT. WELL

02:09:57.356 --> 02:10:00.559
I'M HAVING SAID THAT- WHY IS

02:10:00.626 --> 02:10:06.498
THERE NO- DIRECT- APPROPRIATION

02:10:06.565 --> 02:10:17.910
FOR THESE PARTICULAR PROGRAMS.

02:10:17.976 --> 02:10:19.344
WE'VE GONE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:10:19.411 --> 02:10:22.147
SIDE OF THAT HELPFUL- EITHER

02:10:22.214 --> 02:10:23.015
QUIT TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM

02:10:23.081 --> 02:10:24.349
INVESTMENT PLAN TO DO A

02:10:24.416 --> 02:10:26.418
STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AND

02:10:26.485 --> 02:10:28.253
GOVERNOR INPUT FROM MARKET AND

02:10:28.320 --> 02:10:30.155
EQUITY COMMUNITIES THAT

02:10:30.222 --> 02:10:33.091
COMMUNITIES CAN HELP NOT ABOUT

02:10:33.158 --> 02:10:33.959
WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE WITH THE

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:36.628
PLAN- YEAH THIS YEAR WE'RE

02:10:36.695 --> 02:10:39.464
LOOKING AT MORE ON MY TV AFTER

02:10:39.531 --> 02:10:40.465
TRUCKER WITH THE SHIP TO. MEET

02:10:40.532 --> 02:10:42.301
IF YOU HAVE A DUTY AND THEN WE

02:10:42.367 --> 02:10:43.735
ALSO DO WORKSHOPS THROUGH A

02:10:43.802 --> 02:10:46.238
PUBLIC PROCESS TO PROPOSED PUT

02:10:46.305 --> 02:10:48.440
THE TAPE IN SUCH A TREND THAT

02:10:48.507 --> 02:10:50.008
OUR GREAT TRUCK THINGS OF THAT

02:10:50.075 --> 02:10:53.045
NATURE AND GET INPUT TO REACT

02:10:53.111 --> 02:10:58.817
TO THE MARKET IF YOU WERE. TO

02:10:58.884 --> 02:10:59.418
COVER AND THEN DEPLOY THAT. SO

02:10:59.484 --> 02:11:00.786
WHY WHY YOU DOING THE PROP

02:11:00.852 --> 02:11:05.757
FIRST AND THEN COMING TO US.

02:11:05.824 --> 02:11:06.491
YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S A

02:11:06.558 --> 02:11:07.926
COMBINATION OF BOTH RIGHT I

02:11:07.993 --> 02:11:09.595
THINK SOMETIMES THE MARKET DOES

02:11:09.661 --> 02:11:11.129
NOT TAKE US SERIOUSLY IF WE

02:11:11.196 --> 02:11:12.931
DON'T HAVE MONEY TO BACK IT UP.

02:11:12.998 --> 02:11:13.765
YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A LOT OF

02:11:13.832 --> 02:11:14.700
DIFFERENT CALLED SPECIAL WHEN

02:11:14.766 --> 02:11:15.801
YOU LOOK AT THE WORK IN

02:11:15.867 --> 02:11:17.603
DIFFERENT STATES. AND WE NEED

02:11:17.669 --> 02:11:19.104
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:11:19.171 --> 02:11:20.439
FUNDING TO SHOW THEM THAT IT'S

02:11:20.505 --> 02:11:22.241
REAL AND THEN ENGAGE WITH THEM

02:11:22.307 --> 02:11:23.909
TO DO IT- A LOT OF THE

02:11:23.976 --> 02:11:25.777
PARAMETERS WHICH HELP GUIDE OUR

02:11:25.844 --> 02:11:27.980
DECISIONS NOW. WHAT THEY DID

02:11:28.046 --> 02:11:30.249
LEGISLATION. WHAT'S RCGP

02:11:30.315 --> 02:11:32.184
INVESTMENT PLAN AS WELL AS WITH

02:11:32.251 --> 02:11:33.518
REALLY GREAT TOOLS WHICH WE

02:11:33.585 --> 02:11:35.954
HAVE. WITH AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY

02:11:36.021 --> 02:11:36.488
SEVEN AND SENATE BILL ONE

02:11:36.555 --> 02:11:40.792
THOUSAND. AND ALSO AB EIGHT

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.194
HUNDRED FIVE. THE WHAT WE DO-

02:11:42.261 --> 02:11:44.329
ALL THE CLEAN VEHICLE- FUNDING

02:11:44.396 --> 02:11:51.003
PROGRAMS THAT WAY THE. SO THIS

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:51.937
IS A NEIGHBOR JUST WITH THEIR

02:11:52.004 --> 02:11:53.438
RESOURCES BOARD I'LL JUST JUMP

02:11:53.505 --> 02:11:55.307
IN THAT THE PROCESS ON THE

02:11:55.374 --> 02:11:56.708
CURBSIDE IS VERY SIMILAR TO

02:11:56.775 --> 02:11:58.176
WHAT WAS DESCRIBED ON THE CDC

02:11:58.243 --> 02:11:59.911
SIDE WE TAKE OUR CUES FROM THE

02:11:59.978 --> 02:12:01.246
ANNUAL APPROPRIATIONS FROM THE

02:12:01.313 --> 02:12:04.549
LEGISLATURE. RAN THROUGH- BROAD

02:12:04.616 --> 02:12:05.617
BUCKETS OF FUNDING THAT WE

02:12:05.684 --> 02:12:07.052
OFTEN GET TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:12:07.119 --> 02:12:09.087
WHAT SPECIFIC PROGRAMS SHOULD

02:12:09.154 --> 02:12:10.322
RECEIVE FUNDING AND WHETHER OR

02:12:10.389 --> 02:12:11.590
NOT WE SHOULD BE MAKING ANY

02:12:11.657 --> 02:12:13.992
KIND OF PROGRAM CHANGES- I

02:12:14.059 --> 02:12:15.060
UNDERTAND YOU WERE IN TRYING

02:12:15.127 --> 02:12:16.261
TO FIGURE OUT MAYBE SOME RULES

02:12:16.328 --> 02:12:17.429
OF THUMB EARLIER FOR HOW TO

02:12:17.496 --> 02:12:20.232
THINK ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:12:20.299 --> 02:12:21.533
PROPOSED BUDGET SO- WHAT YOU'LL

02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:22.968
SEE IN. THE GOVERNOR'S. BUDGET

02:12:23.035 --> 02:12:24.636
IS BASICALLY BINS OF DIFFERENT

02:12:24.703 --> 02:12:26.138
TYPES OF FUNDING LIKE EQUITY

02:12:26.204 --> 02:12:28.173
AND HEAVY DUTY BUT THEN INSIDE

02:12:28.240 --> 02:12:29.474
EACH OF THOSE BUCKETS OR ARE

02:12:29.541 --> 02:12:31.043
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. AT LEAST

02:12:31.109 --> 02:12:33.011
FROM THE CAR PERSPECTIVE. SO IF

02:12:33.078 --> 02:12:34.379
YOU LOOK AT A PROGRAM LIKE

02:12:34.446 --> 02:12:36.081
CLEAN CARS FOR ALL.

02:12:36.148 --> 02:12:37.716
PRESCRIPTION REPLACE PROGRAM.

02:12:37.783 --> 02:12:40.285
ON AVERAGE- EIGHT AVERAGE

02:12:40.352 --> 02:12:41.953
INCENTIVE DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT IS

02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:43.555
ABOUT EIGHT THOUSAND DOLLARS

02:12:43.622 --> 02:12:44.756
FOR FINANCING ASSISTANCE IT'S

02:12:44.823 --> 02:12:45.924
ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR

02:12:45.991 --> 02:12:47.859
GRANT PER VEHICLE. SO USING

02:12:47.926 --> 02:12:49.428
THESE AVERAGES MAYBE CAN HELP

02:12:49.494 --> 02:12:50.796
YOU BALLPARK YOU KNOW THINKING

02:12:50.862 --> 02:12:52.497
ABOUT THESE VARIOUS BUCKETS. I

02:12:52.564 --> 02:12:53.832
DON'T REALLY FEEL PARKS IN THIS

02:12:53.899 --> 02:12:55.934
COMMITTEE WE DO SPECIFIC

02:12:56.001 --> 02:12:56.802
NUMBERS SO WHAT'S THE SPECIFIC

02:12:56.868 --> 02:13:02.374
NUMBER. SURE WELL GIVEN. THE

02:13:02.441 --> 02:13:03.008
BALLPARK YOUR BUDGET WITHOUT BE

02:13:03.075 --> 02:13:04.943
HELPFUL. MAYBE LESS SO YES

02:13:05.010 --> 02:13:06.845
RIGHT RIGHT I AGREE. WITH THAT

02:13:06.912 --> 02:13:09.247
WE CAN BOTH AGREE ON THAT. SO I

02:13:09.314 --> 02:13:10.582
THINK THE THING THAT- WE'RE

02:13:10.649 --> 02:13:12.918
BOTH TRYING TO CONVEY IS THAT

02:13:12.984 --> 02:13:13.985
THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT

02:13:14.052 --> 02:13:15.454
PROGRAMS THAT ARE BURIED IN

02:13:15.520 --> 02:13:16.755
THESE BUCKETS AND SO SHOULD THE

02:13:16.822 --> 02:13:18.690
LEGISLATURE MOVE FORWARD. WITH

02:13:18.757 --> 02:13:20.225
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET

02:13:20.292 --> 02:13:21.593
AND FOR THOSE DIFFERENT BUCKETS

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:23.161
WE WOULD THEN USE THE PUBLIC

02:13:23.228 --> 02:13:25.263
PROCESS OVER THE SUMMER TO

02:13:25.330 --> 02:13:28.567
REFINE THOSE ALLOCATIONS ON A

02:13:28.633 --> 02:13:30.936
PER PROGRAM- A PER PROGRAM

02:13:31.002 --> 02:13:32.404
AMOUNT FOR EACH OF THOSE

02:13:32.471 --> 02:13:33.805
BUCKETS. I WHICH WOULD THEN

02:13:33.872 --> 02:13:35.807
TAKE TO REPORT EVERY YEAR AT

02:13:35.874 --> 02:13:37.409
OCTOBER FOR A FINAL DECISION

02:13:37.476 --> 02:13:39.244
LEGISLATURE OF COURSE. YOU KNOW

02:13:39.311 --> 02:13:40.379
IT'S YOUR PREROGATIVE IF YOU IF

02:13:40.445 --> 02:13:41.446
YOU WOULD WANT TO PUT

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:43.248
APPROPRIATE PER LINE ITEM

02:13:43.315 --> 02:13:44.416
THAT'S JUST NOT HOW THE

02:13:44.483 --> 02:13:46.051
EXISTING GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED

02:13:46.118 --> 02:13:49.454
BUDGET DOES. IS SET UP. THE WAY

02:13:49.521 --> 02:13:51.556
YOU SEE IT TODAY. OKAY THANK I

02:13:51.623 --> 02:13:53.692
WANT TO ADD. JUST ONE POINT TWO

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:55.727
IS WHAT CITY. WHAT CITY AN

02:13:55.794 --> 02:13:58.029
ANTENNA WERE SAYING TO. BUT THE

02:13:58.096 --> 02:13:59.898
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- ALSO I

02:13:59.965 --> 02:14:01.700
DON'T. REALLY FOCUS ON ECONOMIC

02:14:01.767 --> 02:14:03.635
DEVELOPMENT. SO ONE OF THE I

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:05.170
MEAN WE NEED TO BUILD THAT

02:14:05.237 --> 02:14:06.171
SEVEN CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE OF

02:14:06.238 --> 02:14:07.739
THE MAJOR BARRIER TO THAT THE

02:14:07.806 --> 02:14:09.674
PLANET BUT WE ALSO NEED. TO

02:14:09.741 --> 02:14:11.510
CREATE JOBS AND TO STIMULATE

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:13.378
THE ECONOMY IN THIS TIME SO.

02:14:13.445 --> 02:14:14.946
THAT IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT

02:14:15.013 --> 02:14:16.181
BENEFIT OF THE GOVERNOR URGED

02:14:16.248 --> 02:14:18.183
FOCUS ON BUILDING OUT THEIR

02:14:18.250 --> 02:14:19.518
MISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE.

02:14:19.584 --> 02:14:20.886
IS BECAUSE THESE ARE SHOVEL

02:14:20.952 --> 02:14:22.654
READY PROJECT WE HAVE. TEN WITH

02:14:22.721 --> 02:14:24.089
SAYING THE PROGRAM THE

02:14:24.156 --> 02:14:24.990
CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC VEHICLE

02:14:25.056 --> 02:14:26.458
INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT WHICH WE

02:14:26.525 --> 02:14:29.094
CAN DEFINE ONE IN THERE. AND WE

02:14:29.161 --> 02:14:31.329
CAN DEPLOY IT. CHARGERS VERY

02:14:31.396 --> 02:14:33.799
RAPIDLY. TO HELP CREATE GOOD

02:14:33.865 --> 02:14:36.268
JOBS. IN YOU KNOW IN AN

02:14:36.334 --> 02:14:37.436
INDUSTRY THAT WE KNOW WE'RE

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:38.437
GOING TO NEED FOR THE FUTURE

02:14:38.503 --> 02:14:39.438
YOU KNOW YOU WANT THIS YEAR

02:14:39.504 --> 02:14:40.605
MISSION VEHICLE INDUSTRY.

02:14:40.672 --> 02:14:42.140
SUGGEST GROWING CRIED HERE IN

02:14:42.207 --> 02:14:43.909
CALIFORNIA WE WANT TO KEEP

02:14:43.975 --> 02:14:46.778
BEING THAT. SHE AND- GLOBALLY

02:14:46.845 --> 02:14:47.646
ON ZERO EMISSION

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:50.015
TRANSPORTATION. AND SO YOU KNOW

02:14:50.081 --> 02:14:52.250
THE BIG INVESTMENT NOW SHOWED

02:14:52.317 --> 02:14:54.352
THE WORLD THAT WE'RE COMMITTED.

02:14:54.419 --> 02:14:54.853
AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO

02:14:54.920 --> 02:14:56.822
OVERCOMING WHAT IS. ONE OF THE

02:14:56.888 --> 02:14:58.690
BIGGEST BARRIERS AND I WAS AND

02:14:58.757 --> 02:15:00.225
STILL. THE BIGGEST BARRIER

02:15:00.292 --> 02:15:01.927
WHICH IS A LACK OF A

02:15:01.993 --> 02:15:07.799
CONVENIENCE. THAT

02:15:07.866 --> 02:15:09.201
INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OTHER AND I

02:15:09.267 --> 02:15:10.001
COMPLETELY WITH YOU BURKE

02:15:10.068 --> 02:15:10.569
COMMISSIONER I THINK THAT I

02:15:10.635 --> 02:15:12.771
THINK THE- IS. ON THE- ONLY

02:15:12.838 --> 02:15:14.306
WORKS IF YOU HAVE. TO FUEL. THE

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:15.073
THIS POINT AS AS YOU KNOW

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:16.775
SWITCHED HAVE UNDER A MILLION

02:15:16.842 --> 02:15:18.510
VEHICLES WERE WELL SHORT OF R.

02:15:18.577 --> 02:15:20.045
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION VEHICLE

02:15:20.111 --> 02:15:22.214
GOAL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE.

02:15:22.280 --> 02:15:23.482
WELL SHORT OF OUR FIVE MILLION

02:15:23.548 --> 02:15:26.017
VEHICLE GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY.

02:15:26.084 --> 02:15:28.253
AND SO WHAT WE DON'T WANT IS TO

02:15:28.320 --> 02:15:30.055
HAVE- A LOT OF CHARGING

02:15:30.121 --> 02:15:32.891
STATIONS WITH NO VEHICLES

02:15:32.958 --> 02:15:33.992
CHARGING AT THE- I THINK THAT

02:15:34.059 --> 02:15:38.663
IS THE- THE- I THINK. THE MAJOR

02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:42.167
QUESTION BECAUSE THERE ISN'T-

02:15:42.234 --> 02:15:44.169
THERE'S NOTHING IN THE PROPOSAL

02:15:44.236 --> 02:15:46.805
THAT REALLY HELPS DRIVE AT THE

02:15:46.872 --> 02:15:49.007
OVERALL GOAL OF GETTING TO THE

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:51.943
FIVE MILLION VEHICLES BY TWENTY

02:15:52.010 --> 02:15:52.410
THIRTY UNLESS IT'S THE

02:15:52.477 --> 02:15:54.045
ADMINISTRATION'S. VIEWPOINT

02:15:54.112 --> 02:15:56.081
THAT THE THAT WE'VE DONE ENOUGH

02:15:56.147 --> 02:15:58.717
IN THE MARKET WILL GET US TO

02:15:58.783 --> 02:15:59.351
FIVE MILLION VEHICLES BY TWENTY

02:15:59.417 --> 02:16:02.487
THIRD. I'LL TRY TO VOTE THE LOW

02:16:02.554 --> 02:16:05.991
INCOME COMMUNITIES. FOR THE

02:16:06.057 --> 02:16:07.926
CHICKEN AND EGG PROBLEM SOUNDS

02:16:07.993 --> 02:16:08.994
AND I ACTUALLY WANT TO THANK

02:16:09.060 --> 02:16:10.462
YOU WITH EVERYTHING FOR AT

02:16:10.529 --> 02:16:13.465
LEADING THE CHARGE TO HUNT AB

02:16:13.532 --> 02:16:14.099
TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN BECAUSE

02:16:14.165 --> 02:16:15.767
IT REALLY HAS BEEN A GREAT TOOL

02:16:15.834 --> 02:16:17.736
FOR US. IN TERMS OF ASSESSING

02:16:17.802 --> 02:16:19.237
WHERE THE MARKET IS AND WHERE

02:16:19.304 --> 02:16:20.005
IT'S GOING AND HOW DO WE MAKE

02:16:20.071 --> 02:16:22.641
SURE WE'RE WE'RE BEING

02:16:22.707 --> 02:16:23.108
STRATEGIC IN OUR STATE

02:16:23.174 --> 02:16:24.175
INVESTMENT- ATTACK AND I

02:16:24.242 --> 02:16:25.443
COMPLETELY AGREE I THINK I

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:26.578
THINK YOU PUT TOGETHER A GREAT

02:16:26.645 --> 02:16:29.080
REPORT AND I WAS- IN ORDER TO.

02:16:29.147 --> 02:16:30.448
CARRY THAT BILL I THINK YOU'VE

02:16:30.515 --> 02:16:31.750
DONE A GREAT JOB IN IDENTIFYING

02:16:31.816 --> 02:16:34.152
THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. BUT I

02:16:34.219 --> 02:16:35.053
THINK THAT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:36.588
OBVIOUSLY. BUT INFRASTRUCTURE

02:16:36.655 --> 02:16:39.291
NEEDS ARE BASED ON ASSUMPTIONS.

02:16:39.357 --> 02:16:41.760
OF GREATER ALECTRA VEHICLE

02:16:41.826 --> 02:16:44.095
ADOPTION. AND SO I GUESS IS

02:16:44.162 --> 02:16:44.996
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

02:16:45.063 --> 02:16:47.032
POSITION THAT WE NO LONGER NEED

02:16:47.098 --> 02:16:51.603
TO- PROVIDE ANY INCENTIVE FOR.

02:16:51.670 --> 02:16:54.472
PASSENGER VEHICLES AND THAT

02:16:54.539 --> 02:16:55.507
NATURALLY THE MARKET WILL JUST.

02:16:55.574 --> 02:16:56.575
GET US TO WHERE WE NEED TO GO

02:16:56.641 --> 02:16:59.077
OUTSIDE OF. AGAIN THE EQUITY

02:16:59.144 --> 02:17:00.011
COMMUNITIES WHICH IS WHERE THE

02:17:00.078 --> 02:17:01.446
BUDGET HAS IDENTIFIED SOME

02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:05.750
NEEDS. RIGHT I DO THINK WE ARE

02:17:05.817 --> 02:17:07.652
SEEING TREMENDOUS PROGRESS

02:17:07.719 --> 02:17:08.920
GLOBALLY I MEAN THE QUESTION

02:17:08.987 --> 02:17:10.755
YOU ASK IS IT TIME TO TAKE

02:17:10.822 --> 02:17:11.923
THEIR HANDS OFF THE WHEEL WHEN

02:17:11.990 --> 02:17:13.158
IT COMES TO THE APPLIANCE AND

02:17:13.224 --> 02:17:14.893

MARKET ACCELERATE AS WE GET

02:17:18.597 --> 02:17:20.465
MORE VEHICLE OPTIONS AT EVERY

02:17:20.532 --> 02:17:22.133

THAT THE TO THE TRANSITION THAT

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:09.180
WORKS FOR EVERYONE- THAT WE

02:18:09.247 --> 02:18:10.415
NEED TO PRIORITIZE MEDIUM AND

A LOW INCOME PERCENT OFFERS

NINETY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR

CONDITIONS THAT IS A PROGRAM

02:20:47.038 --> 02:20:49.307
THAT IS STACKABLE WITH CVR PETE

02:20:49.374 --> 02:20:51.309
WITHOUT C. B. R. P. ON THAT

02:20:51.376 --> 02:20:52.644
PROGRAM THE STOCK'S CAPITAL

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:54.179
BASED PROGRAM WOULD CONTINUE

02:20:54.245 --> 02:20:56.381

HYBRID PLUG IN ELECTRIC-

02:21:10.161 --> 02:21:11.896
BATTERY ELECTRIC SERVICE IS

02:21:11.963 --> 02:21:15.133
THERE A REASON WHY YOUR ARMY-

02:21:15.200 --> 02:21:19.871
SUBSIDIZING. ANYTHING BUT CLEAN

02:21:19.938 --> 02:21:22.507

02:21:22.574 --> 02:21:25.877
PROGRAM. ANYTHING I'M SORRY I'M

02:21:25.944 --> 02:21:26.878
NOT ACTUALLY CHECKING THE

02:21:26.945 --> 02:21:28.746
QUESTION IS THE QUESTION. IN

02:21:28.813 --> 02:21:30.481
THE CLEAN CARS FOR ALL PROGRAM

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:32.750
SOMEONE CAN CAN GET RID OF

02:21:32.817 --> 02:21:34.686
THEIR OLD CAR BUY A NEW CAR BUT

02:21:34.752 --> 02:21:36.621
THERE'S A WIDE VARIETY OF NEW

02:21:36.688 --> 02:21:38.489
CARS THEY CAN BUY THEIR REASON.

02:21:38.556 --> 02:21:41.826
WHY THAT'S NOT RESTRICTED ONLY

02:21:41.893 --> 02:21:45.563
TO- CLEAN CARS. NEW CLEAN CARS.

02:21:45.630 --> 02:21:48.666
OR USE CLEAN CARS SURE SURE SO

02:21:48.733 --> 02:21:49.767
WITH THE STRUCTURE OF THE

02:21:49.834 --> 02:21:52.103
PROGRAM THE IDEA HERE IS THAT

02:21:52.170 --> 02:21:54.138
WE'RE TRYING TO DO OUTREACH AND

02:21:54.205 --> 02:21:56.107
PROVIDE AS MANY CLEAN OPTIONS

02:21:56.174 --> 02:21:57.141
TO LOW AND MODERATE INCOME

02:21:57.208 --> 02:21:59.244
CONSUMERS AS WE POSSIBLY CAN

02:21:59.310 --> 02:22:00.345
WITH THE GOAL OF COURSE OF

02:22:00.411 --> 02:22:01.379
CLEANING UP TRANSPORTATION

02:22:01.446 --> 02:22:03.381
BROKER THE ACCELERATION OF

02:22:03.448 --> 02:22:04.682
THROUGH THE RETIREMENT OF OLDER

02:22:04.749 --> 02:22:06.417
DIRTIER CARS BUT ALSO REPLACING

02:22:06.484 --> 02:22:08.453
WITH CLEANER CARS SO YOU'RE

02:22:08.519 --> 02:22:10.255
RIGHT THE PROGRAM DOES OFFER

02:22:10.321 --> 02:22:11.522
YOU KNOW A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

02:22:11.589 --> 02:22:13.725
TYPES FROM FROM HYBRID TO PURE.

02:22:13.791 --> 02:22:16.861
JEFF YOUR ZERO MISSION WE- AS

02:22:16.928 --> 02:22:17.762
PART OF THE STRUCTURE THE

02:22:17.829 --> 02:22:19.831
PROGRAM BASED ON THE INPUT WE

02:22:19.898 --> 02:22:20.832
ARE GETTING THROUGH THE PUBLIC

02:22:20.899 --> 02:22:22.934
PROCESS WE DID NOT WANT TO

02:22:23.001 --> 02:22:25.103
DICTATE WHICH YOU KNOW OPTIONS

02:22:25.169 --> 02:22:26.271
WERE AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE WE

02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:27.538
UNDERSTAND THAT DIFFERENT

02:22:27.605 --> 02:22:28.773
HOUSEHOLDS HAVE DIFFERENT NEEDS

02:22:28.840 --> 02:22:30.642
WHEN IT COMES TO MOBILITY AND

02:22:30.708 --> 02:22:31.542
SO WE'RE TRYING TO STRIKE THAT

02:22:31.609 --> 02:22:33.811
BALANCE OF GETTING FOLKS INTO A

02:22:33.878 --> 02:22:35.480
CLEANER VEHICLE BUT HELPING

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:37.315
THEM GET INTO A CLEANER VEHICLE

02:22:37.382 --> 02:22:37.982
THAT THAT MEETS THEIR

02:22:38.049 --> 02:22:40.084
TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. I THINK

02:22:40.151 --> 02:22:41.886
JUST COME BACK TO MY M.

02:22:41.953 --> 02:22:46.524
MCAULIFFE INVENTORS COMMENTS.

02:22:46.591 --> 02:22:47.058
PART PART THE REASON WHY I

02:22:47.125 --> 02:22:47.725
THINK THERE'S- THERE THERE'S NO

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:51.896
SUPPORT. TO GIVE- CARB THE

02:22:51.963 --> 02:22:54.866
AUTHORITY- TO SPEND THE MONEY

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:56.067
OVER TO YOUR PERRY WITHOUT

02:22:56.134 --> 02:23:00.238
SPECIFICALLY- LINE LINE ITEM-

02:23:00.305 --> 02:23:00.939
APPROPRIATING DIFFERENT

02:23:01.005 --> 02:23:03.808
PROGRAMS. IS BECAUSE I THINK

02:23:03.875 --> 02:23:04.542
THERE'S A FEELING INCLUDING ON

02:23:04.609 --> 02:23:06.210
BEHALF OF MYSELF. THAT THE

02:23:06.277 --> 02:23:09.647
AGENCY. LISTENS TO CERTAIN.

02:23:09.714 --> 02:23:10.882
STAKEHOLDERS BUT DOESN'T WITH

02:23:10.949 --> 02:23:13.518
INTO THE LEGISLATURE. I FOR ONE

02:23:13.584 --> 02:23:15.019
DO NOT FEEL THE AGENCIES VERY

02:23:15.086 --> 02:23:17.288
RESPONSIVE TO THE LEGISLATURE

02:23:17.355 --> 02:23:21.092
OF LEGISLATURES. IMPORT OR- YOU

02:23:21.159 --> 02:23:23.061
KNOW WHAT WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY.

02:23:23.127 --> 02:23:25.430
I THINK. HIS HIS EXAMPLE WAS

02:23:25.496 --> 02:23:27.699
ILLUSTRATIVE OF. THE TYPICAL

02:23:27.765 --> 02:23:29.434
CARBON ACTION WHICH IS CARP

02:23:29.500 --> 02:23:31.369
TELLS US WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO.

02:23:31.436 --> 02:23:34.906
WE GIVE FEEDBACK AND THEN CARP

02:23:34.973 --> 02:23:35.506
CONTINUES TO DO WHAT THEY WERE

02:23:35.573 --> 02:23:37.275
GONNA DO. SO I REALLY DO HOPE

02:23:37.342 --> 02:23:39.344
WITH- NEW LEADERSHIP COMING IN

02:23:39.410 --> 02:23:40.578
THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANGE IN

02:23:40.645 --> 02:23:42.146
THAT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE

02:23:42.213 --> 02:23:44.148
LEGISLATURE AND THE PUBLIC. ARE

02:23:44.215 --> 02:23:46.484
BECAUSE WE DO HAVE SIGNIFICANT

02:23:46.551 --> 02:23:48.720
NEEDS AND WE DO HAVE- YOU KNOW

02:23:48.786 --> 02:23:50.555

VERY SUPPORTIVE OF. PUBLIC LAST

02:23:53.992 --> 02:23:56.561
QUESTION ON A FIT I KNOW THE-

02:23:56.627 --> 02:24:00.264
SHIFT FROM. PASSENGER VEHICLES

02:24:00.331 --> 02:24:03.001
TO HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES MEDIUM

02:24:03.067 --> 02:24:04.435
HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. I JUST

02:24:04.502 --> 02:24:06.104
WANT TO UNDERSTAND WHY THAT

02:24:06.170 --> 02:24:08.306
TIME IS NOW TO MOVE IN THAT

02:24:08.373 --> 02:24:10.508
DIRECTION AND WHETHER. ON THE

AWARE OF THE BUS MARKET BUT-

02:24:16.647 --> 02:24:18.916
OUTSIDE OF THAT IF THIS IS

02:24:18.983 --> 02:24:19.550
REALLY THE TIME TO MOVE IN THAT

TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WHICH WILL

02:24:58.056 --> 02:24:59.757
REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO THE

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:01.526
EXTENT THAT THEY ARE SELLING.

02:25:01.592 --> 02:25:02.560
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT

EMISSION TRUCKS TO MARKET. AND

02:25:05.763 --> 02:25:06.798
THAT THAT REDUCE REQUIREMENTS

BE ALL THE WAY UP TO CLASS

02:25:10.201 --> 02:25:13.071
EIGHT. THE H. BUT PROGRAM WHICH

02:25:13.137 --> 02:25:13.704
HAS BEEN DISCUSSED A LITTLE BIT

02:25:13.771 --> 02:25:16.107

02:25:29.620 --> 02:25:31.589
TRUCKING. GREAT THANK YOU SO

02:25:31.656 --> 02:25:32.924
MUCH TO JUST JUST TO REITERATE

02:25:32.990 --> 02:25:34.125
I REALLY DO HOPE THAT THE

02:25:34.192 --> 02:25:35.993
AGENCY WILL BECOME AGAIN MORE

02:25:36.060 --> 02:25:38.129
RESPONSIVE TO. I THINK THE

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:40.164
LEGISLATURE AND FRANKLY THE

02:25:40.231 --> 02:25:41.432
PUBLIC'S INPUT I THINK IT'S

02:25:41.499 --> 02:25:44.936
BEEN. LACKING UNFORTUNATELY IN

02:25:45.002 --> 02:25:48.172
THE PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. AND IT

02:25:48.239 --> 02:25:49.640
I DO LOOKED FORWARD TO THE

02:25:49.707 --> 02:25:50.074
FOLLOW UP FROM THE

02:25:50.141 --> 02:25:51.576
ADMINISTRATION TO GET GREATER

02:25:51.642 --> 02:25:53.711
DETAIL ABOUT WHERE THIS. IS

02:25:53.778 --> 02:25:57.515
GOING. BUT I WOULD JUST SAY I

02:25:57.582 --> 02:26:01.886
CAN'T SUPPORT. D. THREE POINT

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:02.520
THIRTY THREE TO FIFTEEN MILLION

02:26:02.587 --> 02:26:03.421
OVER TWO YEARS FOR HEAVY

02:26:03.488 --> 02:26:05.289
VEHICLES IN THE HUNDRED. FIFTY

02:26:05.356 --> 02:26:06.524
MILLION OVER TWO YEARS FOR THE

02:26:06.591 --> 02:26:08.126
TRANSPORTATION EQUITY PROGRAMS

02:26:08.192 --> 02:26:15.533
WITHOUT- LINE BY LINE DETAIL.

02:26:15.600 --> 02:26:16.167
ABOUT WHERE THE MONEY IS GOING.

02:26:16.234 --> 02:26:18.069
THANK YOU. MISS FRIEDMAN DID

02:26:18.136 --> 02:26:19.437
YOU OF ALL OF A TO FOLLOW UP

02:26:19.504 --> 02:26:20.037
AND NOT TO GET TOO DEEP INTO

02:26:20.104 --> 02:26:21.038
THE WOODS BUT I AM WONDERING

02:26:21.105 --> 02:26:24.142
WITH THE EQUITY PROGRAM AND- MY

02:26:24.208 --> 02:26:25.510
COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO

02:26:25.576 --> 02:26:27.245
BROUGHT UP THAT THE LAST THING

02:26:27.311 --> 02:26:28.579
WE WANT IS TO SPEND A LOT OF

02:26:28.646 --> 02:26:29.447
MONEY ON CHARGING

02:26:29.514 --> 02:26:30.748
INFRASTRUCTURE AND HAVE NO WHEN

02:26:30.815 --> 02:26:32.216
YOU SAID I'M WONDERING IF THE

02:26:32.283 --> 02:26:33.651
PROGRAM IS DESIGNED IN SUCH A

02:26:33.718 --> 02:26:35.820
WAY TO LOOK AT THOSE CHARGERS

02:26:35.887 --> 02:26:37.622
AS THE ROLLING OUT TO SEE

02:26:37.688 --> 02:26:39.190
WHETHER THEY ARE ACTUALLY

02:26:39.257 --> 02:26:41.893
BEING. UTILIZED BECAUSE THERE

02:26:41.959 --> 02:26:42.860
ARE A LOT OF BARRIERS OUTSIDE

02:26:42.927 --> 02:26:45.029
OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE- IN

02:26:45.096 --> 02:26:46.197
PARTICULARLY IN LOW INCOME

02:26:46.264 --> 02:26:47.899
COMMUNITIES TO PURCHASING AND

02:26:47.965 --> 02:26:48.866
OPERATING VEHICLES AND IT MIGHT

02:26:48.933 --> 02:26:50.801
EVEN BE JUST- PEOPLE'S

02:26:50.868 --> 02:26:52.336
IMPRESSIONS YOU KNOW COULD BE A

02:26:52.403 --> 02:26:53.504
BARRIER THERE'S ALL KINDS OF

02:26:53.571 --> 02:26:54.438
THINGS THAT COULD STOP PEOPLE

02:26:54.505 --> 02:26:56.507
FROM BEING EARLY ADOPTERS OF

02:26:56.574 --> 02:26:58.476
THIS TECHNOLOGY SO IS A PROGRAM

02:26:58.543 --> 02:27:00.111
DESIGNED TO EVALUATE IS IT GOES

02:27:00.178 --> 02:27:02.446
ALONG WITH THE- THE CHARGES ARE

02:27:02.513 --> 02:27:03.581
ACTUALLY BEING USED AND HOW

02:27:03.648 --> 02:27:05.416
THEY'RE BEING USED AND BY WHOM.

02:27:05.483 --> 02:27:13.024
AND TO PIVOT. IF NEED BE. ARE

02:27:13.090 --> 02:27:14.926
THEY AT. THE START AND THEN AND

02:27:14.992 --> 02:27:16.827
THEN IF YOU WANT TO- EMBELLISH

02:27:16.894 --> 02:27:19.363
AT ALL. SO AT RIGHT NOW YOU

02:27:19.430 --> 02:27:22.166
KNOW WE DON'T HAVE. THE BIG

02:27:22.233 --> 02:27:23.901
DATA ON HOW MANY. PEOPLE ARE

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:25.937
USING THE CHARGERS AND YOU KNOW

02:27:26.003 --> 02:27:28.172
WHAT HOW LONG ARE USING THEM

02:27:28.239 --> 02:27:29.607
FOR BUT ACTUALLY PLANNING TO DO

02:27:29.674 --> 02:27:31.542
A PILOT PROJECT TO EVALUATE

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:32.710
THAT BECAUSE IT'S A REALLY

02:27:32.777 --> 02:27:36.480
IMPORTANT QUESTION- SIX. ONE OF

02:27:36.547 --> 02:27:37.248
THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IS

02:27:37.315 --> 02:27:38.683
PACKED WE GET AS I SAID WE HAVE

02:27:38.749 --> 02:27:40.818
A CHICKEN EGG PROBLEM SO WE

02:27:40.885 --> 02:27:42.453
WANT TO HAVE THE CHARGERS OUT.

02:27:42.520 --> 02:27:44.755
BEFORE THEY'RE BEING USED. AND

02:27:44.822 --> 02:27:46.924
WE KNOW THAT. THE CHARGING

02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:48.826
MARKET ISN'T CURRENTLY SELF

02:27:48.893 --> 02:27:52.396
SUSTAINING. YOU KNOW THEY'RE

02:27:52.463 --> 02:27:53.464
NOT MAKING MONEY- AND WHAT

02:27:53.531 --> 02:27:54.899
WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. IS

02:27:54.966 --> 02:27:56.801
STAGGER THE INVESTMENT SO THAT

02:27:56.867 --> 02:28:00.204
WE GET- THE CHARGERS OUT THERE

02:28:00.271 --> 02:28:03.007
BEFORE. THEY ARE AND YEARS THAT

02:28:03.074 --> 02:28:03.941
INFRASTRUCTURE OUT THERE BEFORE

02:28:04.008 --> 02:28:06.310
IT'S NEEDED. THEN AS THE MARKET

02:28:06.377 --> 02:28:08.012
STARTS TO TAKE OFF AND WE'LL

02:28:08.079 --> 02:28:10.648
SEE. GREATER UTILIZATION OF

02:28:10.715 --> 02:28:13.484
EACH CHARGER. THEN THE AMOUNT

02:28:13.551 --> 02:28:14.485
THAT WE'RE GONNA FUNDS PER

02:28:14.552 --> 02:28:16.487
CHARGE WILL GO DOWN I MEAN OUR

02:28:16.554 --> 02:28:17.688
GOAL IS TO THEIR OUT MOST

02:28:17.755 --> 02:28:19.423
INVESTMENT OVER OVER YOU KNOW

02:28:19.490 --> 02:28:22.093
CHIMED. IN IT IN A KIND OF.

02:28:22.159 --> 02:28:24.395
LOGICAL TRANSPARENT WAY FOR THE

02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:26.530
MARKET ISN'T. FOR HERKY JERKY

02:28:26.597 --> 02:28:29.567
BUT THEY SEE THAT THE HORIZON.

02:28:29.634 --> 02:28:31.035
AND THEY'RE MAKING INVESTMENTS

02:28:31.102 --> 02:28:33.037
TO TAKE TO GET THERE. I THINK

02:28:33.104 --> 02:28:34.205
ON THE TRADING SIDE WE MAY

02:28:34.272 --> 02:28:37.508
ALWAYS NEED SOME CHARGERS. THAT

02:28:37.575 --> 02:28:40.211
ARE. ARE FUNDED BY THE STATE IN

02:28:40.278 --> 02:28:41.912
PLACES WHERE THE INSURGENTS

02:28:41.979 --> 02:28:43.314
WILL GO TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS

02:28:43.381 --> 02:28:44.949
IS. SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE THAT

02:28:45.016 --> 02:28:46.083
WORKS FOR EVERYBODY YEAH I

02:28:46.150 --> 02:28:47.952
THOUGHT I JUST HIGHLY YOU KNOW

02:28:48.019 --> 02:28:49.654
I THINK WE REALLY NEED TO BUILD

02:28:49.720 --> 02:28:50.521
THIS PROGRAM IN SUCH A WAY THAT

02:28:50.588 --> 02:28:52.723
YOU DO HAVE. A LOT OF

02:28:52.790 --> 02:28:54.292
EVALUATION ON THE GROUND

02:28:54.358 --> 02:28:55.660
BECAUSE YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD

02:28:55.726 --> 02:28:57.194
JUST ANECDOTALLY THAT FOR

02:28:57.261 --> 02:28:59.330
INSTANCE. EVEN IN MULTI FAMILY

02:28:59.397 --> 02:29:00.931
BUILDINGS THAT HAVE CHARGING

02:29:00.998 --> 02:29:03.134
STATIONS. THE LANDLORDS WANT TO

02:29:03.200 --> 02:29:04.435
CHARGE RESIDENTS TO USE THEM

02:29:04.502 --> 02:29:05.236
BECAUSE OF THE COST OF THE

02:29:05.303 --> 02:29:07.004
ELECTRICITY WHICH RIGHT NOW IS

02:29:07.071 --> 02:29:09.006
NOT BORNE BY THE INDIVIDUAL-

02:29:09.073 --> 02:29:11.208
TENANTS. SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:12.143
LOT OF THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN

02:29:12.209 --> 02:29:14.512
ON THE GROUND THAT REALLY.

02:29:14.578 --> 02:29:17.815
BECOME HUGE BARRIERS SO JUST

02:29:17.882 --> 02:29:19.583
HAVING A CHARGER IN A LOCATION.

02:29:19.650 --> 02:29:21.285
REALLY DOESN'T GIVE US ANY DATA

02:29:21.352 --> 02:29:22.553
AT ALL ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

02:29:22.620 --> 02:29:23.754
LIKE YOU SAID TO BE UTILIZED

02:29:23.821 --> 02:29:26.991
AND HOW AND BY WHOM. SO PUTTING

02:29:27.058 --> 02:29:28.492
A CHARGER FOR INSTANCE IN A

02:29:28.559 --> 02:29:29.560
MULTI FAMILY BUILDING AND THEN

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:30.494
FINDING OUT IT'S ONLY BEING

02:29:30.561 --> 02:29:31.162
USED BY THE BUILDING OWNER WHEN

02:29:31.228 --> 02:29:33.030
THEY VISIT THE BUILDING. AND

02:29:33.097 --> 02:29:34.165
NOT THE TENANTS IS NOT THE

02:29:34.231 --> 02:29:36.434
INTENTION EITHER. SO I THINK

02:29:36.500 --> 02:29:37.935
THIS PROGRAM HAS TO HAVE

02:29:38.002 --> 02:29:40.771
EXTREMELY STRONG- OVERSIGHT AND

02:29:40.838 --> 02:29:42.673
METRICS AND GUARDRAILS BECAUSE

02:29:42.740 --> 02:29:45.276
IT'S A LOT OF MONEY THAT. WILL

02:29:45.343 --> 02:29:47.311
BE PUT UP. AND A GREAT

02:29:47.378 --> 02:29:49.113
INTENTIONS BUT IT WOULD BE

02:29:49.180 --> 02:29:54.085
AWFUL TO FIND OUT. LATER THAT

02:29:54.151 --> 02:29:54.652
THE MONEY WAS SPENT AND IT'S

02:29:54.719 --> 02:29:55.252
NOT HELP. THE CA. THAT IT'S

02:29:55.319 --> 02:29:56.020
INTENDED TO HELP. SO I WOULD TO

02:29:56.087 --> 02:29:57.788
SEE AT SOME POINT DETAILS ABOUT

02:29:57.855 --> 02:30:01.058
HOW WE'RE GOING TO. EVALUATE

02:30:01.125 --> 02:30:02.827
THE CHARGERS AND THE INVESTMENT

02:30:02.893 --> 02:30:04.362
THAT WE'RE MAKING. THANKS SO

02:30:04.428 --> 02:30:07.565
MUCH. I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT

02:30:07.631 --> 02:30:08.899
QUESTION APPRECIATE THE

02:30:08.966 --> 02:30:10.234
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

02:30:10.301 --> 02:30:11.769
LEGISLATURE INSURANCE TO FIGURE

02:30:11.836 --> 02:30:13.070
OUT HOW DO WE DO THIS IN A WAY

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:15.106
THAT IS BEST FOR THE PUBLIC

02:30:15.172 --> 02:30:16.574
DOLLARS BACK FOR THE MARKET AND

02:30:16.640 --> 02:30:18.676
THAT'S FOR AN EQUITABLE
