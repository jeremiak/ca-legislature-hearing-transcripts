OF THE PROCEEDING AS IT'S BEING CONDUCTED. AND WE WILL MAKE SURE THAT THAT TAKES PLACE WARDINGLY NOW THAT WE'VE GONE OVER HEARING THIS JUST TAKES I WANT TO WELCOME OUR WITNESSES TO THE HEARING AND THANK THEM FOR COMING BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TO DISCUSS HOW CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE IS BEING IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT DROUGHT FOR THANK MY COLLEAGUES SUMMARY WAS FOR HIS INITIATIVE IN PUTTING THIS HEARING TOGETHER ON THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC. AS YOU ALL KNOW WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR SECOND DRY YEAR IN THAT ROLE AND ON TRACK TO SEE OUR THIRD DRIEST YEAR ON RECORD. WHAT STANDS OUT FOR ME THIS YEAR IS HOW QUICKLY CONDITIONS HAVE DETERIORATED WE KNEW WE HAD A DRY WINTER BUT DUE TO HIGHER TEMPERATURES THE SNOW PACK AS EFFECTIVELY GONE BY JUNE FIRST AND WE NEVER SAW AN ESTIMATED EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET AND RUN OFF. TODAY WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE IMPACT OF DROUGHT ON OUR STATE AGRICULTURE SECTOR. AGRICULTURE IS CRITICAL PART OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND OUR HISTORY. AND IT IS FRIGHTENING TO SEE HOW THE CURRENT DROUGHT IS IMPACTING THIS IMPORTANT SECTOR. AND DISRUPTING THE LIVES OF MANY INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. PUTTING THOSE IN OUR DISTRICT. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING MORE ABOUT THE PROBLEM AND WELCOME IDEAS. ABOUT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE WHAT THE STATE NEEDS TO BE DOING TO RESPOND AND TO PREPARE FOR THE DROUGHT. SO WE CAN MINIMIZE ADVERSE IMPACTS. THERE'S TOO MUCH AT STAKE NOT TO TAKE ACTION WITH THAT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE SOME RIVAS. TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS THANK YOU ALL. WELL THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN GOOD AFTERNOON COLLEAGUES IN I WANT TO THANK CHAIRMAN GARCIA AND- THE STAFFS OF BOTH OUR COMMITTEES TO PABLO VICTOR WENDI AND NICOLE FOR WORKING- AND PAULINE- THIS HEARING- IN A VERY- BUT- THE TIMELY MANNER YEAH THIS IS A POINT HEARING- AS WE- WE DISCUSS AND TALK ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF OUR CURRENT DROUGHT ON ON ON OUR STATE'S FARMERS OR AGRICULTURAL OPERATORS IN AN AGRICULTURAL LANDS. AND AS WE ALL KNOW AGRICULTURE IS A SIGNIFICANT SECTOR IN OUR STATE'S ECONOMY A CONTRIBUTOR ON FIFTY BILLION TO OUR STATE ECONOMY IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. AND GIVEN OUR UNIQUE CLIMATE AS WELL AS THE INGENUITY OF OUR FARMERS YOU KNOW THERE ARE. SOME- SOME COMMODITIES- YOU KNOW- MORE- SOME COMMODITIES ARE GROWN HERE IN IN CALIFORNIA THAN ALMOST ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY. IS COMPRISED OF SMALL IN SOME FAMILY FARMERS WHO COOPERATE ON SMALL AND TIGHT MARGINS. AND ARE VERY- SOME VULNERABLE TO EVEN SMALL FLUCTUATIONS WERE TALKING ABOUT SOME SOME FLUCTUATIONS AND PRICING CROP OUTPUT IN OF COURSE THE AVAILABILITY. OF WATER AND DROUGHT FOR MANY OF THESE FARMERS AND THE AGRICULTURAL OPERATIONS IS NOT A TEMPORARY INCONVENIENCE IT'S A SIGNIFICANT THREAT IS A THREAT TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD IT'S A THREAT TO THEIR ABILITY TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE FOR THEIR OWN FAMILIES OWN KIDS AND THAT'S WHY IS THIS YEAR HAS PROGRESSED I'VE BEEN STARTING TO YOU KNOW I'VE HEARD THE CONCERNS THAT MOUNTING SOME CONCERNS BY FARMERS UP AND DOWN OUR OUR OUR STATE. WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MAGNITUDE OF THIS CURRENT DROUGHT. AND THE IMPACTS ARE ALREADY FILLING AS A RESULT OF IT MANY WHO HAVE LACKED ACCESS TO WATER ALREADY OR ARE OR IN ANTICIPATION OF IT HAVE MADE SOME SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN PLANTING CROPS OR HAVE MADE CUTS IN THEIR PRODUCTIONS THIS GROWING SEASON IN THE CURRENT DROUGHT IS ALREADY THE MOST SEVERE SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT IT COMES JUST TWO YEARS AFTER THE LAST DROUGHT RAVAGED FARMS FROM TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. THEY GIVEN THE STARKEST ELLERY IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE THIS YEAR'S DROUGHT CAN ONLY BE EXPECTED TO BECOME A MORE COMMON OCCURRENCE. IN FACT SCIENTISTS SAY THAT DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE THE AMERICAN WEST IS DRIER THAN IT HAS BEEN IN TWELVE HUNDRED YEARS OUR HOT AND DRY. IS YOU KNOW IS UNFORTUNATELY THE NEW REALITY FOR OUR FARMERS FOR RESIDENTS OF THE STATE. AND THEY NEED OUR SUPPORT YOU KNOW WE MUST DO ALL WE CAN ASK POLICYMAKERS TO UNDERSTAND THIS EVOLVING SITUATION OR THESE CONDITIONS. AND WORK TOGETHER. WORK TOGETHER TO ADJUST TO THIS NEW REALITY AND THOUGH THE DROUGHT HAS THUS FAR MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED FARMS ON THE NORTH COAST AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FARMERS IN THE SENATE DISTRICT I REPRESENT ARE STRUGGLING AS WELL AS THE SALAD BOWL THE WORLD FARMS AROUND THE SALINAS VALLEY AND WATSONVILLE IN SEMINOLE COUNTY THEY DEPEND ON. INEFFICIENT AND SUSTAINABLE STORAGE OF WATER- LONGER WAIT YEARS- AND THEY DO THIS TO GET US THROUGH OUR DRYER YEARS- JUST RECENTLY I VISITED THE NACIMIENTO AND ST. OR THE U. S. SENATE TONIO DAMS IN THE COUNTY MONTEREY. AND THIS TRIP WAS EYE OPENING THE SEEN FIRST HAND HOW BOTH RESERVOIRS ARE AT CRITICALLY LOW LEVELS. NASCIMENTO'S AT 40% CAPACITY. SAN ANTONIO AT 7% CAPACITY THAT'SUNBELIEVABLE 70% CAPACITY. AS A RESULT WATER- SOME RELEASES FROM THESE RESERVOIRS TO HELP RECHARGE AQUIFERS AND- AND HELP. PREVENT SEAWATER INTRUSION IN OUR REGION- STOPPED TWO POINT FIVE MONTHS AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. WHICH MEANS NO WATER WILL BE RELEASED IN AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER OF THIS YEAR NOW I ALSO RECENTLY VISITED SMALL FARMS AND- IN OUR DISTRICT- INCLUDING THE TARA MIKO ORGANIC FARM IN SAN MARTINE IN. THE SOUTHERN PART OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THEY GROW SOME TOMATOES AND A VARIETY OF OTHER AND VEGETABLES. I WAS IMPRESSED AT THE RESILIENCE- ANY EFFORTS THAT THEY HAVE MADE TO CONSERVE WATER- YOU KNOW BYE BYE- INCLUDING THE UTILIZATION OF DRIP IRRIGATION TECHNIQUES IN. THE ROTATION OF CROPS. BUT WHILE THE- THE SALINAS IN THE BOROUGH VALLEYS MAY HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO LAST THIS SEASON. WE'RE CERTAINLY ALL WORRIED ABOUT THE TOUGH DECISIONS GROWERS WILL NEED TO MAKE NEXT SEASON AND IN THE YEARS AHEAD. TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO FEED NOT ONLY OUR STATE BUT THE REST OF THE NATION. AND THAT'S WHY I'M GRATEFUL TO HAVING THIS DISCUSSION HERE THIS AFTERNOON AS WE FACE WHAT. COULD BE ANOTHER SEVERAL YEARS OF DROUGHT WE MUST LOOK AT WHAT ACTION WE CAN TAKE THIS POLICY MAKERS IN THE NEAR AND LONG TERM TO ENSURE OUR STATE'S FARMERS CAN REMAIN RESILIENT. TO DROUGHT- AND TO ASSURE OUR LIMITED WATER SUPPLY IS USED EQUITABLY AND RESPONSIBLY. AGAIN LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM OUR PANEL TODAY AND AGAIN WANT TO THANK OUR COLLEAGUES WHO ARE HERE AND THINK CHAIRMAN GARCIA. FOR HELPING ORGANIZE THIS YEAR I THINK THANK YOU A THREE OF US AND- WE HAVE OUR FIRST PANEL IT. AND BELIEVE IS READY TO GO J. LEARNED PROFESSOR AT. UC DAVIS CENTER FOR WATERSHED SCIENCES SECTOR KAREN ROSS PARMON OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT CHAIRS STATE WATER RESOURCES BOARD BOTH ALL THREE OF THEM WILL SPEND ANYWHERE BETWEEN EIGHT AND TEN MINUTES TO- PROVIDE THEIR PRESENTATIONS. AND THEN WILL- A PAUSE FOR IT QUESTIONS. AND ANSWERS FROM- THE BODY HERE SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO WE'LL START WITH- PROFESSOR J. LINE IF HE'S- SHE'S READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH ALL CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU THANK YOU- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INVITING ME HI FOR THIS AUGUST PADDLE AND- SOME ALL ASSEMBLY WATER COMMITTEE WATER AND I CALLED HER COMING I WANT TO MAKE SOME VERY BRIEF REMARKS TO. BASICALLY SUMMARIZED WITHOUT CONDITIONS SOME OF WHICH IS ALREADY A MEMBER OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER AND THEN TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE APPLICATIONS I'LL TRY TO BE BRIEFED OF REPORT TIME FOR TWO ONE DAY SINCE. WE'VE STARTED LIKE LATE R. CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG HISTORY OF DROPS AND IT'S CLIMATE IS INHERENTLY I FELT PRO WE HAVE A LOT OF VERY ABILITY. ITSELF ACTUALITY IN CALIFORNIA HAS SOME OF YOU ARE PROBABLY QUITE AWARE WE HAVE MORE FLOOD YEARS AND DROUGHT YEARS FOR EVERY YEAR THAN ANY OTHER STATE OF THE UNION THAT MEANS WE ARE ALWAYS HAVING TO WORRY ABOUT- DROUGHTS AND FLOODS AT THE SAME TIME SO WE'RE WE'RE ALWAYS TRYING TO MANAGE TO WORK TOGETHER UP WATER AND WHAT YEARS AND STARTED RESERVOIRS AND AQUIFERS FOR DRY YEARS. WERE TRYING TO MANAGE AGRICULTURE THIS CASE FOR BOTH OF THE DRY YEARS AND FOR FLOOD SO WE INVEST A LOT OF LEVEES AND WE INVEST A LOT OF WATER MANAGEMENT. OVERALL IT'S BEEN A CONSTANT- OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY YEARS OF CALIFORNIA'S STUFF HELLO ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT YOUR THIS YEAR AS WAS MENTIONED AS THE THIRD DRIEST YEAR AND MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS OF SUFFOCATION RECORD IT FOLLOWS ON LAST YEAR WHICH WAS A LYFT DRIVERS TO YOUR THE PRECIPITATIONARCTIC SO. TO VERY DRY YEARS WITH THIS YEAR BEING EXTRAORDINARILY IN ADDITION TO THAT THE TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN MUCH WARMER AND SO THE PRECIPITATION DOESN'T GET AS FAR ALL THE PRECIPITATION EVAPORATES BACK UP INTO THE ATMOSPHERE BEFORE IT CAN MAKE ITS WAY INTO A STREAM INTO A RESERVOIR WATER RECHARGING AQUIFERS THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE MODERN DROUGHT THIS DROUGHT OF THE ONE FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN BOTH WERE. MUCH WARMER CONDITIONS ONE I THINK WE'RE GOING TO SEE THAT IN THE FUTURE. THERE'S SOME INTERESTING TALKING THE LITERATURE THAT DEMONSTRATES PRETTY CLEARLY THAT THOSE HIGHER RATES OF EVAPORATION MAKES SMALL DROUGHT IN THE BIGGER DROUGHT AND SO WE'RE GOING TO POTENTIALLY FROM THERE SEEING. LONGER AND MORE FREQUENT DROUGHTS THAN WE HAVE SEEN OTHERWISE IN ADDITION TO WHATEVER CHANGES OF PRECIPITATION PATTERNS WE MIGHT SEE WITH CLIMATE CHANGE IS THE INCREASE IN TEMPERATURES ARE REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WATER WAS AVAILABLE TO US THIS REDUCED ABOUT OF WHAT IS AVAILABLE TO US IN THIS DROUGHT BECAUSE OF COURSE AFFECTING THE SURFACE WATER AVAILABLE FOR AGRICULTURE ESPECIALLY IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TOMORROW GRAYSON BUT ALSO IN PARTS OF THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY AND THE SMALLER REAL OF THE RIVER VALLEYS ABOUT- NAPA VALLEY AND SONOMA- RUSSIAN RIVER AMONG THE OTHER BASINS OF THE STOCK IS THIS DROUGHT IS PRETTY PRETTY EXTENSIVE COVERING THE ENTIRE STATE OF BIRTH OTHER PART OF THE CENTRAL VALUES WAS MUCH MORE DROUGHT PRONE BECAUSE IT RELIES MUCH MORE ON IMPORTED SERVICE WATER. BURGER ALSO RIDICULOUS I HAVE ALSO BANNED AS YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD MAJOR IMPACTS ON FOREST AND AQUATIC ECOSYSTEMS INCLUDING THE LOSS OF WHAT AROUND SALMON FELL SCREAMO SHASTA DAM. AND WE'RE SEEING OUR EXPANDED WILDFIRE IMPACTS WILDFIRE SEASON. COMFORTING THE ADDITIONAL PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER THAT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE OF REDUCE SERVICE WATER SUPPLIES FOR AGRICULTURE YOU'RE SAYING BROUGHT OUT OF WORLD GROUNDWATER TABLES ONE THAT'S AFFECTING RURAL HOUSEHOLD WELLS AND SMALL COMMUNITY WELL SO WE HAVE QUITE A LOT OF SMALL PARTICULARLY POOR COMMUNITIES THAT ALREADY HAVE SHALLOW WELLS- BEING VULNERABLE TO THESE KIND OF ATTACKS WHAT COULD BE EXPECTED TO INCREASE. BY NEXT YEAR TO REMAIN STRONG. NEXT YEAR IS ALSO DRY ALL THE IMPACTS TO AGRICULTURE THE ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS INCREASING IMPACTS URBAN AREAS SMALL TOWNS WERE AFFECTED. THIS YEAR AND MORE LARGER STUDIES COULD BE AFFECTED NEXT YEAR ALL WILL BE WORKS THE WARMER TEMPERATURES CLIMATE OR WORSENING DROUGHT BOB AND REDUCING THEIR INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF WATER THAT HAS TO BE RELEASED TO PROVIDE COLD WATER FOR NATIVE COLD WATER FISH DURING THE DROUGHT SO WE'RE- PROVIDES QUITE A LOT OF CHALLENGES. NEXT YEAR IS MORE THAN USUALLY LIKELY TO NEED TO BE DRY THIS YEAR WE HAVE A VERY DRY WATERSHEDS WE HAVE GREATLY DEPLETED RESERVOIRS AS THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER MICHAEL OUR WE HAVE WATER TABLES WHICH ARE NOW MUCH LOWER WHAT'S THE WARMER TEMPERATURES THAT WILL INCREASE ABOUT FOUR TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE WE LOOK FORWARD SO IT'S GOING TO TAKE MORE PRECIPITATION TO MAKE NEXT YEAR WET. I DON'T NORMALLY WOULD TAKE SO IT MAKES IT MORE LIKELY THAT WE'RE GOING TO HELP US ROUTE YOUR THAT WOULD REFORM FOR THOUSANDS TO PREVIOUS PRIVATE I'M NOT A BIG CHANGE BROADER CULTURE I THINK IN THIS DROUGHT RIVAS RELATIVES HOWEVER CULTURE TENDS TO MAKE UP ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF ITS WELL DEFICIT BY PUMPING IT IS MORE GROUNDWATER WHAT THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT THAT WATER IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE REPAID THE PASSED AWAY JUST WHAT CUMULATE AS LAND SUBSIDENCE. FROM WATER OVERDRAFT BUT WHEN YOU'RE A STABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT. THAT WATER IS GOING TO HAVE TO BE REPAID IN WATER YEARS. BY MOSTLY BY REDUCING GROUNDWATER PUMPING WHICH IS GOING TO BE. REDUCING YOUR DATA COLLECTION THE LONG TERM. WE CAN EXPECT TO SEE PROBABLY HALF A MILLION TO A MILLION ACRES OF IRRIGATED LAND OUT OF PRODUCTION IN THE LONG RUN. JUST TO ACCOMMODATE THE ENDING. OF OVER THE TOP OF THE SITE. SOME OF THE OTHER BIG THINGS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO SEE HOW LONG WITH A- ALL PRIOR YEAR MIGHT. OCCUR THIS COMING YEAR THERE'S ADDITIONAL URBAN WATER CONSERVATION WHICH HELPS A LITTLE BIT. BUT GIVEN THE RELATIVE MAGNITUDE MUCH GREATER MAGNITUDE OF BOB WATER USE AGRICULTURE THAT URBAN AREAS IT ONLY HELPS A LITTLE BIT WHAT WE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO SEE NEXT YEAR CONTINUES TO BE DRIEST EXPANSIONS OR LAND IDYLLWILD WELL MOSTLY FROM LOWER VALUE CROPS WILL HAVE REDUCED ECONOMIC IMPACT PROBABLY THE THING THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO DO MOST TO PREPARE US TO HAVE THESE MORE FREQUENT AND MORE SEVERE DROUGHTS OF THE FUTURE I'M TO KEEP AGRICULTURAL PROSPEROUS THROUGHOUT THOSE KIND OF EXTREME ABOUT. IS TO HAVE A MUCH MORE FORMAL. OUR WATER ACCOUNTING SYSTEM STATEWIDE ACROSS THE STATE AGENCIES THESE ARE NEEDED TO HEIGHTEN SERVICE WATER RIGHT MINISTRATION HOWEVER WHAT DOES HOW MUCH WATER THEY HAVE. FOUND USEFUL FOR SIGMA PLANNING AND IMPLEMENTATION AS WELL AS ENVIRONMENTAL WATER MANAGEMENT. ESPECIALLY IN THE FUTURE WE'RE GOING TO SEE WATER RIGHT CURTAILMENTS BECOME MUCH MORE TEETH SO THOSE. WATER RIGHT CURTAILMENTS ARE GOING TO BE MIRRORED YEAH RETIREMENTS AND- ALL GROUNDWATER AVAILABILITY ON THE SHIP ALL RIGHTS RESERVED THE END OF MY REMARKS ON DAHLE WE LOVE SOMETIMES WHAT YOU AND I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR WE'RE GOING TO ASK OUR SECRETARY ROSS NOW TO BEGIN HER PRESENTATION. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARDS YEAH AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER REQUESTS ARE HOLDING THIS HEARING IN INVITING ME TO BE HERE- IT'S NOT FUN TO FOLLOW THAT KIND OF SOBERING NEWS FROM JAKE LAND BUT THAT'S NOTHING COMPARED TO THE PAIN THIS THING FELT WITHIN A REAL COMMUNITIES ARE FARMING FAMILIES AND BY THE FARMWORKERS WHO DEPEND ON MANY OF THOSE ANNUAL CROPS THAT WERE. PLANTED AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE KEEP IN MIND THE WHOLE COMMUNITY THAT'S IMPACTED BY THIS DROUGHT- BUT THAT THAT CIRCUMSTANCES WE FIND OURSELVES IN ARE UNAVOIDABLE AND THE SET UP HERE IS SUCH THAT I WON'T TAKE A LOT OF TIME TO BE ABLE TO DISCUSS. WHAT MAKES CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE SO UNIQUE OTHER THAN WE ARE THE PRODUCER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF FRUITS AND NUTS AND DAIRY PRODUCTS AND VEGETABLES AND PROCESSING TOMATOES AND ALL THOSE THAT ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO NUTRITION AND FOOD SECURITY- AND WE DO IT BETTER HEAR MORE EFFICIENTLY HERE ARE WITH A STRONGER COMMITMENT TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR STANDARDS THAN MOST ANY OTHER STATE IN MANY OTHER COUNTRIES. AND SO IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE FIND WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER- I AM VERY THANKFUL THAT YOU'RE INCLUDING SEVERAL PANELS OF OURS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MOST IMPORTANT WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE IMPACT THAT WE HAVE THE PEOPLE WHO MOST DIRECTLY IMPACTED. TO HEAR THEIR IDEAS AS WE WORK TOGETHER TOO CUTE MEDICATION WHEREVER IT'S POSSIBLE TO TRY TO LESSEN THOSE PACKAGE GIVE ME THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS THAT ALSO WORK TOGETHER FOR THE LONGER TERM SOLUTIONS MEDITATES ON A COUPLE OF PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE BEEN BUILDING SINCE THE LAST DROUGHT TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCY OF AGRICULTURE. THEY'RE CREATED AS PART OF OUR CLIMATE SMART AGRICULTURAL PROGRAMS AND THANKS TO YOUR WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR SEVERAL OF THOSE HAVE RECEIVED CURRENT YEAR FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET ACT THAT WAS PASSED- AT THE END OF JUNE AND WE'RE VERY HOPE THAT AS YOU TO GET WITH THE ADMIN ON THE ENTIRE POINT ONE BILL DOLLARS RESILIENCY AND CHAT WITH PACKAGE THAT WILL BE ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS THT ARE FUNDED. IN PARTICULAR I WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT OUR ON FARM WATER USE EFFICIENCY PROGRAM. WAS CREATED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WE HAVE FUNDED OVER EIGHT HUNDRED PROJECTS- ACROSS THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE COMMITTED TO FUNDING AT A MINIMUM 25% OF OUR PROJECTS THAT WILL GO TO. SOCIALLY DISADVANTAGED FARMERS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO IMPROVE THEIR RESILIENCY WE HAVE INVESTED EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS TO DATE THE BUDGET THAT. WAS APPROVED- DOESN'T TO FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ADD TO THAT PROGRAM. IT ALSO FUNDS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AS WELL AS DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS AS WE SCALE UP THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF EVERY DROP OF WATER POSSIBLE. OVER THE LIFETIME OF OUR SWEET PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. BY HUNDRED AND SEVEN THOUSAND. METRIC TONS- BUT THIS IS A WIN WIN PROGRAM NOT ONLY REDUCES GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BECAUSE WE'RE IMPROVING OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY WE'VE ALSO BEEN ABLE TO SAVE. ALMOST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET OF WATER THROUGH THE USE OF THE MOST PRECISE TECHNOLOGY BUT HOW WE USE WATER. THAT'S THE EQUIVALENT OF THIRTY SEVEN AND A HALF BILLION GALLONS OF WATER WHICH WOULD STILL SEVENTY OLYMPIC POOL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO PUT THAT INTO- THAT KIND OF THE CONTEXT- WE ALSO RECEIVED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROGRAM. THAT SPECIFICALLY WORKING WITH GROWERS OF ALL SIZES IN ALL PARTS OF THE STATE WITH MOBILE IRRIGATION LABS TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE. OPTIMIZE THE USE OF OUR WATER. IRRIGATION SYSTEMS ARE MAKING SURE THAT THE PUMPS ARE OPERATING AT MAXIMUM CAPACITY AND THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT WAY BUT THE DRIP LINES ARE ALL CLEARED IN THAT WERE. ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ON HOW TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF THE SYSTEMS THAT WE HAVE ON THE GROUND. WE ALSO HAD TWO MILLION DOLLARS TO CONTINUE THEIR OUTSTANDING WORK THAT I KNOW THAT. YOU'LL HEAR ABOUT LATER IN THE LAST COUNT TO BE ABLE TO CATCH WHAT THE AND ARE IN EACH DROUGHT WHAT IT MEANS FOR JOB LOSS WHAT IT NEEDS FOR FOLLOWING WHAT IT MEANS FOR ECONOMIC LAST- AND THIS YEAR I AM VERY EXCITED THAT WITH THE GOOD WORKING LED BY SEE MORE SAD WILL ALSO BE CREATING SOME SUPPORT DECISION TOOLS TO HELP GROWERS MAKE DECISIONS ON TRADEOFFS IN FUTURE DROUGHTS- THE OTHER PROGRAM I WANTED TO TOUCH ON THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE RIGHT NOW IS OUR HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. MANY PEOPLE AGO WHY ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT HEALTHY SOILS AND THIS IS ABOUT DROUGHT. BUT THAT WHOLE ISSUE OF WATER HOLDING CAPACITY IN OUR SOILS UNDERSTANDING HOW IMPROVING AND INCREASING SOIL ORGANIC MATTER. WILL ACTUALLY LEAD TO WATER HOLDING CAPACITY IN THE SOILS WE FIGURE THAT. FOR EACH 1% INCREASE IN SOIL ORGANIC MATTER. WE ARE MAKING AVAILABLE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GALLONS OF SOIL WATER THAT'S THEREFORE USE LANCE OVER TIME THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE OUR OUR RESILIENCY TO DROUGHT. IT'S NOT OVERNIGHT BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE STARTED BACK IN THAT SHORT LIFETIME OF THIS PROGRAM WE'VE INVESTED FORTY ONE MILLION- DOLLARS OVER. SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY PROJECTS- FOR REDUCTION IN GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS OF A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND METRIC TONS. VERY I THINK VERY TELLING THAT WHEN E THINK ABOUT THE WAYS THAT WE'RE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS WERE REALLY LOOKING FOR MULTI BENEFITS- AND SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED THAT WE HAVE AN ADDITIONAL FIFTY. MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET- I WAS ASKED ALSO TOUCH ON USDA PROGRAMS USDA HAS A DIFFERENT METHOD FOR WORKING ON WEDNESDAY DECLARED DISASTER IT'S DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE DROUGHT MONITOR. THAT SHOWS GRASSLAND CONDITIONS. AND WHAT'S HAPPENING AND RANGELAND SO AS OF MARCH OF YEAR SEVENTY BILLS MADE ANOTHER OF THIS ASSISTANCE PROGRAM MORE READILY AVAILABLE TO FARMERS AND RANCHERS- SOME OF THOSE WORK VERY WELL CALIFORNIA- NOT ALL OF THEM DO AND SECRETARY BILL SECOND SELF. HAS MADE A NOTE THAT OUR EXISTING DISASTER ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS DO NOT WORK WELL FOR DROUGHT AND THEY ESPECIALLY DO NOT ACCOMMODATE THE UNIQUENESS OF WESTERN IRRIGATED AGRICULTURE AND THAT'S ONE THING THAT I THINK WE ALL WANT TO WORK ON TOGETHER. YES WITH THE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS HAS BEEN INCLUDED BY CONGRESS AND THEY'RE ADEQUATE CREATIONS. BUDGETS IS THAT WERE VERY ENGAGED AND EXPANDED THOSE DISASTER PROGRAMS TO INCLUDE DROUGHT AND WE WANT TO WORK WITH RATIONAL DELEGATION TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WILL ACCOMMODATE. CALIFORNIA DROUGHT THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THANK WOULD MAKE THESE EASILY AVAILABLE ON OUR WEBSITE. ARE ESPECIALLY HELPFUL FOR THE RANGELAND AND JERRY COMMUNITY FOR ASSISTANCE ON FORAGE. HEY IS A VERY SHORT SUPPLY THIS YEAR AND IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE WHEN YOU CAN FIND THAT AS WELL AS SHORT TERM WATER HAULING. TO LIVE STOCK. AVAILABLE EARLIER THIS U. S. ALSO FORTY TWO. MILLION DOLLARS BEING MADE AVAILABLE TO FOR WESTERN STATES FOR A PILOT PROGRAM ABOUT FORTY ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS CALIFORNIA WILL RECEIVE ALMOST TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS OF THAT PROGRAM THROUGH THE NATURAL RESOURCE CONSERVATION SERVICE IT'S REALLY TAKING ALL OF OUR CONSERVATION PROGRAMS AND HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THOSE PROBLEMS SO YOU'D SEE- OVER SEVEN HUNDRED APPLICATIONS WERE RECEIVED IN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. DOZEN ELSE NOT SHOULD BE COMING OUT IN SEPTEMBER SO THAT'LL BE AN ADDITIONAL TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS A WEEK AND ON TOP OF THAT USDA HAS MEGA BLOCK GRANTS AVAILABLE TO THE KLAMATH DROUGHT RELIEF AUTHORITY FOR FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN THE KLAMATH BASIN WHICH HAS BEEN VERY VERY HARD YEAH THOSE WILL BE PAYMENTS TO GROWERS TO REDUCE THEIR WATER DEMAND AS A WHITE AS A WAY TO TRY TO. IMPROVE THE WATER AVAILABILITY FOR THE SALMON AND SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES THEY ARE UP WITH THAT I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT I HOPE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON FARM BILL PROGRAMS GOING FORWARD IT'S NEVER TOO EARLY TO TALK ABOUT THOSE PROGRAMS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WE WORK OUR WAY THROUGH- THIS YEAR'S BUDGET ON DROUGHT AND WATER RESILIENCY- THERE ARE SOME VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ALLOW AND HEALTH AND GROUND WATER RECHARGE PROGRAMS. VERY CRITICAL GOING FORWARD A LAND REPURPOSE SAYING A MULTI DENNIS ATLANTIC PURPOSING PROGRAM A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THEY CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE MEDIA WAY ON DROUGHT IN THE NEXT YEAR AS WELL AS LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR AGRICULTURAL LANDS IN THE BACK END LOOK FORWARD TO CHRISTIANS YEAH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SECRETARY KAREN ROSS WILL- PROCEED WITH THE NEXT- FILE SPEAKER THIS THAT CHAIRED WHAT S. COMMAND STAY WATER RESOURCE BOARD THANK YOU SIR AND YOU JERRY AS WELL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND BRING US TOGETHER TODAY THE TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT IS DEFINITELY UNPRECEDENTED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE SCALE OF DROUGHT YOU HEARD PROFESSOR LINE GO OVER THE DOCTOR OLOGY AND IT IS- CURRENTLY SPEND- I TALK TOO MUCH AND I WILL JUST SAY THAT I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE INCREDIBLE WORK THAT ARE COUNTIES AND LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN DOING TO RESPOND TO DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THEIR LOCAL. COMMUNITIES BUT ALSO HAVING TO RESPOND TO OTHER EMERGENCIES LIKE KOBE AND CERTAINLY THE WILDFIRES THAT WE ARE ALL ALSO YOU'LL BE HAPPY TO RESPOND TO AT THE STATE I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP AS WELL HERE OF. SECRETARY ROSS AND THE REST OF IT THE ADMINISTRATION THIS HAS BEEN A WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT APPROACH REALLY WHEN IT COMES TO THE COMPLEX WAYS IN WHICH DROUGHT IMPACTS ALL OF OUR UNITY. AND AS WE RELATE LOOK FOR THE FUTURE HERE AND THINKING OF WHAT WE ALL NEED TO BE DOING AS WE CONTINUE TO FIND DRY CONDITIONS DROUGHT CONDITIONS AND PREPARE FOR A DRY WINTER AND HOPE THAT WE DON'T HAVE ONE BUT WE HAVE TO PREPARE NOW FOR CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS WE NEED COMMUNITIES THAT CONTINUE TO ASSESS THEIR- THEIR- THEIR SITUATIONS. AND IMPORTANTLY WORK WITH THE STATE AND THEY'RE COUNTY EMERGENCY OFFICES THE BEST EVALUATE HOW WE'RE ALL CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO WHAT I KNOW IS A VERY CHALLENGING SET OF. CONDITIONS FOR A LOT OF US OUT THERE OVER THE LAST MY THE BOY AND HAVE TO TAKE EMERGENCY ACTION FOR ACT AND DEVELOP EMERGENCY CURTAILMENT REGULATIONS FOR WATER RIGHT HOLDERS. IN KEY WATERSHEDS AS YOU HEARD FROM PROFESSOR LEARNED. THAT THERE RUSSIAN RIVER WATERSHED WAS ONE OF THE MORE. EARLIER WATERSHED THAT WE UNDERSTOOD WORDS IN IN NEED AND THE TROUBLE AND IN FACT. LAST YEAR WE WORKED WITH COMMUNITY TO ISSUE TEMPORARY URGENCY CHANGE PETITIONS OUT THERE KNOWING THAT THE WATER BOARD. WHICH ARE RELAXATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS TO HELP RESPOND TO WHAT WERE ALREADY DRY CONDITIONS LAST YEAR. AND SO WE'VE HAD TO RESPOND HERE A QUICK FASHION TO WORSENING DROUGHT CONDITIONS IN THE SPRING. WE FOUND AS AS PROFESSOR LINE COVERED AT NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND ACRE FEET. ARE NOT MATERIALIZING WITHIN THE MAJOR RESERVOIRS OF OUR STATE WATER PROJECT AND CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. THAT QUICK THE DEEPENING OF DROUGHT IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE NEVER SEEN AND IS REALLY CHARACTERIZING. WHAT IS THE SCOPE OF WORK THAT WE HAVE THE- ABILITY TO SPREAD OVER A YEAR YEAR AND A HALF IF YOU LOOK AT THE CONDITIONS AS THEY SLOWLY ENCROACHED ON THE LAST DROUGHT. AND COMPRESS THEM HERE IN THE SUMMER AND TAKE EXTRAORDINARY ACTION- WHEN IT COMES TO. THE CURTAILING CLOUT WATER RATES AND I WATERSHED. THAT'S BECAUSE AGAIN TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE'RE PREPARING FOR A DRY WINTER WE WANT TO KEEP AS MUCH WATER IN OUR RESERVOIRS AS WE CAN NOW. WE KNOW THAT CONDITIONS ARE AS FAST AS THEY WILL BE AT LEAST UNTIL WE START TO SEE ANY RELIEF IF WE CAN DO. AND THE NEW WATER HERE AND IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL COLLECTIVELY ARE CONTRIBUTING TO OUR SUCCESS HERE. AND THAT'S REALLY THE STORY OF CALIFORNIA. IS A COLLECTIVE SUCCESS THAT WE- ARE ALL ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT VERY ABILITY THAT PROFESSOR LINE DISCUSSED. THAT THAT SWINGING BETWEEN DROUGHT AND FLOOD AND WE KNOW WITH CLIMATE CHANGE THAT SWING BETWEEN THOSE TWO. THOSE TWO STATES ARE ONLY GOING TO GROW MORE INTENSE WE'LL HAVE DRIER DROUGHTS. WE HAVE A WATER SYSTEM. TRULY THAT WAS BUILT TO THE TWENTIETH CENTURY AND WE ARE NOW IN THE TWENTY FOUR CENTURY WITH TWENTY FOUR CENTURY AND TWENTY FIRST CHAO SO IT'S ALL UPON US ABOUT HOW. TO BEST. COLLECTIVELY WORK THROUGH HOW WE WILL VIEW THESE CHALLENGES AND REALLY SEE THEM AS A GENERATIONAL OPPORTUNITY TO REINVEST IN OUR WATER SYSTEMS. TO RETHINK HOW WE MADE MATT MIGHT MANAGE IN THE FACE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS. WITH DEEPENING DROPS AND NO MORE IMPORTANT DISCUSSION IS WITH OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY WHERE WE KNOW PARTICULARLY IN RURAL COMMUNITIES. THE INTERSECTION BETWEEN DRINKING WATER ACCESS AND- AND AGRICULTURE ARE SO IMPORTANT. THAT WE NEED TO SEE OUR COMMUNITIES HOLISTICALLY HERE. AND IMPORTANTLY BRING BRING THE BRING TO BEAR THE SORT OF DECISION MAKING THAT WE ALL COLLECTIVELY HAVE TO DEMONSTRATE. IN THIS DROUGHT AS THE PROFESSOR SAID WE DO NEED TO GET MORE DATA BE MORE GRANULAR AND BETTER MANAGE OUR WATER RESOURCES PARTICULARLY THE WATER RIGHT SPACE. INTO THE NEXT INTO THE YEARS AHEAD WE'VE GOT SOMEWHAT OF A LIGHT TOUCH OUR WITH ADMINISTRATION OF WATER RIGHTS IN THE STATE. AND IF WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE THROUGH YOUR DEEPER DROPS WE HAVE TO GET BETTER AT TELLING THE DROPS. TIGHTENING BY THE ACTIONS OF THE MULTITUDE OF WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS AND WATERSHED. IN A WAY THAT MAKES THEM ALL COLLECTIVELY INDIVIDUALLY BETTER DECISION MAKERS BUT IMPORTANTLY AS A WATERSHED ALLOW US TO DO THAT. IT IS IMPORTANT THAT WE BRING ALONG COMMUNITIES AND- HELP. DEVELOP THE COMMON DECISION SUPPORT TOOLS NOT UNLIKE THE ONES THAT SECRETARY. ELECTIVELY FROM SOME GREATER RESOURCES TEST SOME OF THESE CHALLENGES. I'LL JUST SAY THAT I'M PROUD THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS BEEN ABLE TO INVEST IN THE LAST. FIVE OR FIVE YEARS SINCE TWENTY SIXTEEN WHAT STRUCK. SIX POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN THE STATE. THAT'S AND DRINKING WATER INFRASTRUCTUREWASTEWATER STORMWATER CAPTURE BROWN WATER CLEAN UP IMPORTANTLY WATER RECYCLING. WE HAVE TO BE MAKING THESE INVESTMENTS INTO OUR AND OUR COMMUNITIES AND THAT'S JUST A SMALL DROP COMPARED TO ALL THE LOCAL INVESTMENT THAT GOES ON. TO CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN OUR OUR OUR WATER SYSTEMS. BUT IN THE FACE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND THE FACE OF THE AMOUNT OF ADJUSTMENT WE NEED TO DO TO MAKE TO OUR MANAGEMENT. WE'RE GONNA NEED TO SEE GREATER INVESTMENTS IN IS WHY I'M I'M THANKFUL AND PROUD OF THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE IN THE GOVERNOR FOR THE ONE POINT THREE BILLION. THAT THE BOARD IS PROVIDED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN DRINKING WATER AND WASTEWATER. THOSE WATER RECYCLING PROJECTS THEY MAY NOT SEEM TO BE. SUCH A SOLUTION THAT AGRICULTURE CAN REALLY TAP INTO BUT THEY ARE AND THEY'RE EXAMPLES OF SUCCESS AS WELL. DELPORT TO WATER DISTRICT IN MODESTO BEING ABLE TO REALLY MAXIMIZE AGAIN THAT THE USE OF OUR OF WATER IN OUR OUR COMMUNITY. AND SO WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO MAKING THOSE INVESTMENTS HAVE THE DOWN PAYMENT TO WHAT WE KNOW OUR LARGER FEDERAL DISCUSSIONS AND PREPARING OURSELVES HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT IMPORTANTLY IN THE WEST AS WELL. FOR THE CHALLENGES WILL BE FACING BATCHES FROM DROUGHT BUT FROM FLOOD AND IMPORTANTLY THAT THERE ARE INVESTMENTS WE CAN BE MAKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. IN ORDER TO IMPROVE ALL OF OUR CONDITIONS HERE. SO THANK YOU AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE IN THE PORT FROM THE DISCUSSION THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN THE OTHER TWO SPEAKERS WERE GOING TO- LOOK TO THE- THE BODY HERE AND- SIX A MONTH QUESTIONS IN THE COMMENTS I. BELIEVE THERE IS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT WANTED TO. ASK SOME% QUESTIONS. SO MEMBERS SALAS ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISS CURTIS WANTED OUT REQUIRE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN ALLUDED TO THINK BY A COUPLE OF THE PANELISTS AND- MISTRUST ABOUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY IN AND- THE SECRETARY WAS ON AS WELL BUT JUST WANTED TO ASK. BUT YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF BUDGET ITEMS HERE ONE HEALTHY INFRASTRUCTURES GONNA BE HELPING WITH THAT YOU ALLUDED TO THE ONE POINT THREE- AND THEN I ALSO WANTED TO. JUST AN UPDATE ON. THE DISCUSSIONS AROUND SICK MY GIVEN THE DROUGHT IS GETTING WORSE. IS THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT DELAYING THAT IMPLEMENTATION OR HOW IS. THE DEPARTMENT LOOKING AT ADDRESSING. NOT ONLY THE EXTREME DROUGHT BUT EVEN THE SICK MY DEADLINES THAT LOOM BEFORE US. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IS THAT IS THAT DIRECTED TO CDFA AS THE DEPARTMENTS. I'M HAPPY TO THEIR STRUCTURE TO BOTH OF YOU. THANK YOU OKAY ALL RIGHT- I WAS THE FIRST AND SAY THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION. AT THIS STAGE IS WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES AND UNFORTUNATELY WE DON'T HAVE A REPRESENTATIVE HERE. THEY ARE REVIEWING THOSE- I WOULD I WOULD. CAUTION THAT. OF THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING WITH THE FIVE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS IS SIGNIFICANT ESPECIALLY IF WE CAN LEVERAGE THAT WIH FEDERAL DOLLARS. TO THINK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS NECESSARY. TO HELP US CAPTURE HE FLOWS AND DO SMART WATER BANKING I KNOW YOU REPRESENT PART OF KERN COUNTY AND THEY CERTAINLY HAVE. FIGURED THIS OUT BUT WATER BANKING CAPTION. RECHARGE FLOWS IS GOING TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART BUT NOT THE ONLY PART OF OUR FUTURE GOING FORWARD. WITH THE REALITY OF SIGMA. IF WE IF WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE FOR THE LONG TERM. WE REALLY NEED TO CONTINUE THE WORK THAT'S HAPPENING ON THE SUSTAINABLE GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ACT. I'M NOT AWARE OF ANYONE WHO'S WHO'S. PUSHING FOR DELAY AT THIS TIME DEFINITELY ALSO I'LL SEE IF THE INVESTMENT ARE ARE SIMPLY ARE DEFINITELY A MULTITUDE BUT CAN BE TWO FOLD THING IT'S ABOUT THE DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS AND THE SYSTEM THAT THAT CAN BAY DRINKING WATER TO COMMUNITIES. BUT ALSO. ON A LARGER SCALE HOW WATER IS MANAGED AND IN WATERSHEDS IN THERE THE SECRETARY PROCESS POINT WE NEED TO GET SMARTER AND BE ABLE TO IMPROVE THE CALL QUALITY AND CONDITION OF OUR GROUNDWATER BASINS. BECAUSE THEY SHARE THAT RESOURCE WITH DRINKING WATER AND IS SO CRITICAL FOR AGRICULTURE TO BE ABLE TO DEPEND UPON IT DURING A DROUGHT. IN THIS PAINFUL AND I KNOW IT'S HARD IS BUSINESS THINK MUCH CAN SEEM IN THESE IN THESE SPACES HERE I THINK IT JUST REALLY EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS TO REALLY. BEGIN TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE'RE GOING TO MANAGE THIS RESOURCE TO LOOK FOR THE LONG TERM KNOWING THAT IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO. AGRICULTURE AND PEOPLE LIKE COMMUNITIES AND IT'S AND IT'S UNDERSTANDING HOW WATER UNDERGROUND AND THEN BE ABLE TO MOVE IT WHEN IT'S FAIR THREE TIMES OF. OF FLOODS AND WHEN THERE'S ACCESS IT'S GONNA BE REALLY IMPORTANT AND THERE'S WATER RIGHTS COMPONENT THERE IMPORTANTLY WHERE WE NEED TO BETTER UNDERSTAND AND THE MOVEMENT OF THAT WATER WHO. BEST HAS PRIORITY IN RIGHT AND BEGIN TO REALLY WORK WITHIN THE WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM TO ENSURE THAT IF THEY'RE TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE TO BE HERE WITH US AS A TOOL. AS OPPOSED TO IMPEDIMENT WITCHING QUICKLY BECOME IF WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH DATA TO BE MAKING DIFFICULT DECISIONS. AROUND THOSE REAL CRITICAL PROJECTS THANK YOU AND IF I MAY JUST A FOLLOW UP THROUGH THE CHAIR BY APPRECIATE THAT I APPRECIATE YOU TALK ABOUT WATER BANKING I KNOW. EARLY ON WHEN I FIRST GOT ELECTED WE TALKED ABOUT WATER BREAKING. THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I WAS TOLD AT THE TIME I THINK IT WAS- DEPARTMENT WATER RESOURCES. WAS TAUGHT WAS SAYING THAT. WE CAN CREATE REGIONAL WATER BANKING AND FIFTY OUT OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE- AS WE- YOU KNOW HAVE THIS FIVE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT MAYBE THAT'S- THE STRATEGY WE PURSUE IS WATER BANKING AND EACH OF THE DIFFERENT COUNTY SO THEN. WE DON'T RUN INTO- SOME OF THE OTHER OBSTACLES OF. TEMPERATURES INFLOWS AND- TURNING ON THE BANKS THAT THE WATER BREAK AT. THE PUMPS OF TURNING OFF THE PUMPS ARE NOT- SO ACTUALLY LOOK FORWARD TO IT IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU GUYS ARE PROPONENTS OF. OF WATER BANKING IT MAY BE THAT I'M HOPING THAT'S SOMETHING THAT GETS PURSUED AS WE- START DIVESTING THIS AND THESE INVESTMENT DOLLARS. AND THEN SECONDLY I DIDN'T REALLY HEAR. AN ANSWER ON THE SIGMA QUESTION SO JUST THAT THERE'S DISCUSSIONS BUT- REALLY NOTHING- HARD AND FAST ABOUT WHETHER IT'S BEING GOING TO BE DELAYED OR NOT SOCREDS. THAT'S CORRECT I KNOW OF NO DISCUSSION ABOUT DELAYING AND AGAIN I I'VE I'VE READ ABOUT SOME COMMUNITIES TALKING ABOUT HOW DO WE REALLY LEAN AND HOW DO WE ACCELERATE THE WORK GIVEN HOW IMPORTANT IT IS IN THE- CASE OF DROUGHT. SOME MEMBER. SMITH SERVICE GOING TO WORK TODAY WALKING HOW ARE YOU TODAY. MY QUESTION IS DO IT WITH IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WITH PROPOSITION ONE FUNDING HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT IN WATER STORAGE FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. NOT COUNTING THE ORVILLE. FROM MAINTENANCE PROJECTS OR OF THE PROJECT BUT HOW MUCH MONEY HAS BEEN SPENT ON WATER STORAGE. I APOLOGIZE I'M WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD OUR OUR CHUNK OF THE PROBLEM BOND DOLLARS WASN'T I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE STORAGE I DOLLARS I CAN'T SAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE DOLLARS THE BOARD HAS RECEIVED- DURING A PROP ONE FOR WATER RECYCLING. DRINKING WATER WASTEWATER GROUNDWATER CLEANUP STORMWATER CAPTURE THAT THOSE DOLLARS ARE OUT I'M MAKING A DIFFERENCE NOW AND IMPORTANTLY HELPING US BUILD RESILIENCY I KNOW THAT WE ARE ARE ARE FURTHER ALONG ON. THE DISCUSSION AROUND THOSE STORAGE DOLLARS AND SECRETARY ROSS I DON'T KNOW IF. YOU HAVE A BIT CHECK OUT ON THAT I KNOW THAT- IT IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT AND IMPORTANTLY THOSE THOSE PROJECTS THEMSELVES HAVE TO BE READY AND FAR ENOUGH ALONG TO REALLY BE ABLE TO RECEIVE THOSE OTHERS NUMBER OF- QUALIFICATIONS WITHIN THE PROGRAM. AND I KNOW THAT THAT THERE IS A CERTAIN ROUND IS ALREADY BEEN COMMITTED TO YOU- AND AT THIS POINT FOR THEIR WORK AND I APOLOGIZE. IT'S NOT- WITHIN THAT THE STATE WATER BOARDS FOR YOU NECESSARILY OKAY AND MAYBE A FOLLOW UP TO IS WITH THE SITES RESERVOIR KNOW WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON- FORTY FIVE FIFTY YEARS. WILL WE EVER SEE THAT STORAGE PROJECT THE- DO IT FOR ATTENTION AND BE BUILT. OKAY THAT THE STATE BOARD IS HERE TO DO WITH PART AND MAKING SURE AND WORKING WITH- THE LOCAL PROJECT PROPONENTS I KNOW THAT THERE'S A WATER RIGHTS COMPONENT. TO THOSE STORAGE PROJECTS AND OUR STAFF ARE ARE WORKING WITH EARLY WITH THE APPLICANTS AND MAKING SURE THAT THE BOARD IS IN A BOTTLE NECK AS- THOSE PROJECTS CONTINUE THEIR THEIR POINT OF- THE WASHINGTON THAT. AND OUTDOOR KEEP PUSHING FOR WATER STORAGE BUT IN THE BUDGET I ASK FOR BILLION DOLLAR FOR WATER STORAGE EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND I GOT VOTED OUT SO I'M HOPING MY COLLEAGUES TO LOOK IN THE FUTURE I THINK WATER STORAGE WILL BE THE KEY. FOR ALL OF US DRINKING WATER FARMERS AND STORAGE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THE SUMMER- SUMMER WOULD. YES THANK YOU AND I'D QUESTION FOR THE CHAIR HERE WHO SEEMS TO BE GETTING A LOT OF THESE QUESTIONS BUT CREATE THAT- YOU KNOW I HEAR A LOT FROM CONSTITUENTS IN MY DISTRICT ABOUT- CERTAINLY CHALLENGES AROUND WATER RIGHTS IN PARTICULAR- WIN THEY CAN DIVERT WATER- AND SO MANY IN MANY AREAS OF MY DISTRICT WATER DIVERSION HAPPENS DURING THE SUMMERTIME YET IT WOULD BE REALLY MUCH MORE BENEFICIAL TO DIVERT WATER IN THE WINTER TIME TO. FOR OFF STREAM STORAGE- OUTSIDE THE ASHRAM SORT YET THE CHALLENGE WITH CHANGING THOSE WATER RIGHTS AND THE LACK THAT IS IT HAS REALLY. IS REALLY A PROBLEM IS IT DO YOU SEE IN THE FUTURE SIMPLEX INCREASE FLEXIBILITY AROUND THAT SOURCE STREAMLINING THE PROCESS EVEN IN PARTS OF MY DISTRICT WE HAVE YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO CREATE PONDS FOR STORAGE. THEY OFTEN RUN INTO VERY AN EVEN ENFORCEMENT OF THE RULES AROUND WHO WHERE YOU CAN HOW YOU BUILD UPON IT VARIES FROM COUNTY TO COUNTY AND IT CAN BE REALLY FRUSTRATING SO THERE HAVE BEEN BILLS IN THE LEGISLATURE TO STREAMLINE THAT. BUT IF YOU ASK FOLKS OUT IN THE- LIVING IT IT DOESN'T FEEL VERY STREAMLINED. YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT I AS I SAID THE WATER RIGHTS SYSTEM HAS TO BE THERE TO BE ABLE TO. HELP US ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND HAVE A THE ABILITY FOR WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS TO DO THE EXACTLY THE WORK THAT YOU'RE SAYING I KNOW THAT. WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR NORTH OUR WORK IN THE NORTH COAST AND IN THE AREA I KNOW INTEREST YOUR COUNTY PARTICULARLY. WE ARE WE'RE WE'RE ENCOURAGING THAT SORT OF MOVEMENT FROM DIVERSION DURING THOSE TIMES WHEN YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH DURING THE WATER DURING DURING WINTERTIME SO. WE'RE WE'RE HERE REPUTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE DO. AND YOU TO INVEST IN OUR WATER RIGHTS ADMINISTRATION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THOUGH TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AROUND THE FACT THAT NOTE NINETY FOURTEEN IN RECORD RIGHT HOLDERS THE NECESSARY PAYMENT TO THE ADMINISTRATION-OF WATER RIGHTS AND MAYBE THERE'S WAYS THAT WE CAN ALL. COLLECTIVELY YOUR PICK UP SOME LOW HANGING FRUIT TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE BETTER RESOURCE THE ADMINISTRATION OF IT I KNOW THAT WE NOW HAVE AN OFFICE OF ADMINISTRATING. ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS OFFICE AND WANT TO THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR THAT WE'VE BEGUN TO START TO. HAVE MORE MOVEMENT IF YOU WILL WITHIN THE WATER RATES DECISION MAKING SPACE SO THAT ALL THESE DECISIONS DON'T HAVE TO JUST COME TO THE BOARD WE HAVE A DEDICATED OFFICE THEY CAN BEGIN TO WORK THROUGH. THE WATER ITCHEN MINISTRATION AND LATE THROUGH. A SOME DECISIONS AND I THINK THAT USING THOSE RESOURCES ARE IMPORTANT BUT IMPORTANTLY ALSO LOOKING UP WATER RATES. AT LARGE A BET AND THINKING HOW BEST TO RESOURCE IT HOW BEST WE MAKE SURE IT WORKS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. YOU'RE GOING INTO THE TWENTY FIRST CENTURY BECAUSE IT IS SO IMPORTANT IT IS. ALLOWING A MOCKING THAT DECISION MAKING AND ON THE WATERSHED SCALE IN WAYS THAT. YOU CAN HELP US BETTER MANAGE THROUGH THE CHALLENGES SO THANK YOU SO THE MEMBERSHIP THAT. THANK YOU RIGHT ANY OTHER QUESTIONS- MISTER MESSAGING THANK YOU VERY MUCH A- CHAIR GARCIA AND THE CHAIR RIVAS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP IN BRINGING UP THIS URGENT ISSUE- I APOLOGIZE SO I MISSED SOME PART PORTIONS OF THE HEARING ALTHOUGH I WAS TRYING TO WATCH A FIRM- THE TV MONITOR- MISTER CHAIR RIVAS. TALKED ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW THE. GROWING REALIZATION OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS BEING HERE AND NOW. BEING MANIFESTED IN THE DROUGHT REALITIES THAT WE'RE SEEING THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY BRING IT HOME THE URGENCY OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BEING ADDRESSED TODAY I DO WANT TO GO INTO PERHAPS RAISE A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE FROM WHAT I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES YOU KNOW AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF I MERRILY A SUBURBAN LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT- I DON'T HAVE ANY AGRICULTURE MY DISTRICT. BUT THE YOU KNOW I DO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE WHEN IT TOOK A RECENT ROAD TRIP WITH MY FAMILY FROM. LOS ANGELES- ALL THE WAY THROUGH- THAT THE- CENTRAL VALLEY A TO SACRAMENTO AND THEN UP TO THE NORTHERN BORDER OF THE STATE. THAT I FELT LIKE I GOT A- A SPECTRUM OF EVIDENCE OF THE CLIMATE CRISIS MANIFESTING ITSELF IN IN TERMS OF THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS YOU KNOW IT EVERYTHING FROM SEEING THE RESERVOIRS- AT- YOU KNOW ALARMINGLY LOW LEVELS TO- SEEING TO- YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF THE SIGNS ALONG THE I. FIVE- SIGNS CALLING ON GOVERNOR NEWSOM TO BUILD MORE WATER STORAGE- AND- BUT WHAT REALLY STRUCK ME THE MOST WAS- SEEING ALL THE ALMOND ORCHARDS AND THE YOU KNOW. I KNOW THIS IS NOT GONNA BE A VERY POPULAR ABOUT PERSPECTIVE BUT I JUST READ A RECENT ARTICLE. IN THE ATLANTIC MAGAZINE ABOUT HOW YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE JUST NOT PRACTICING SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND AND IT IT IT JUST SEEMS LIKE YOU KNOW WERE THE AQUIFER'S ARE BEING DRAINED THE LAND IS SINKING AND YOU KNOW DESPITE WHAT WE OFTEN HEAR FROM THE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY THAT THAT THEY CARE MORE. ABOUT BEING GOOD STEWARDS OF THE LAND I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING AND I SEE ALL THE TO THE TOUGH TALK ALL THE CALLS ABOUT INCREASED WATER STORAGE MERELY GOING TOWARD SUBSIDIZING WHAT SEEMS TO BE AN UNSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY AND SO I I'M SORRY I GOT A CALL OUT THE ALMOND INDUSTRY- YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE THAT THAT HAS BEEN IN THE- AT LEAST IN THIS ARTICLE THAT WAS DISCUSSED BUT I. I WANTED TO ASK A- AND ANY OF THE SPEAKERS A MINUTE IT I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THEY'RE- ONE OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS ASKED ABOUT. POSTPONING THE DEADLINE FOR SIGMA MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE PUTTING IT OFF TOO FAR AND THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT DOING ENOUGH QUICKLY ENOUGH IN ORDER TO. PROTECT THE LAND THAT THAT HAS BEEN- SO FERTILE FOR SO MANY GENERATIONS FOR GENERATIONS INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIANS- IS THERE ANY EFFORT. TO FOCUS ON THE UNSUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURAL PRACTICES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS AND REALLY YOU KNOW FACE HEAD ON THE REALITIES IN OVER THE THAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE THE REALITIES OF THE DROUGHT CONDITION THAT'S ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE- RATHER THAN JUST CONTINUE TO KICK THE- CAN DOWN THE ROAD. SOMEONE THEN I'M GOING TO MAKE AN ASSUMPTION THAT MAY BE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE DEPARTMENT OF AGRICULTURE. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR VIEWPOINT- IT IS CLEARLY SOMETHING THAT- AS WATER RELIABILITY AND AFFORDABILITY DICTATE MORE AND MORE THE KINDS OF CROPS WOULD GROW IN THE STATE. AT THAT ALREADY HAS OF THE LAST THREE DECADES. WE HAVE SEEN THE MOVEMENTS. OF BASED ON AVAILABILITY OF WATER SUITABLE SOILS AVAILABILITY OF LABOR. AND RETURNS ON INVESTMENT FOR THOSE FAMILY FARMERS MOVE TO HIGHER AND HIGHER VALUE SPECIALTY CROPS LIKE ALMONDS. THERE'S ALSO A MOVE TO GO TO A PROP LIKE ALMONDS BECAUSE WE'RE ONE OF ONLY FIVE MEDITERRANEAN CLIMATES. AND REPRODUCE OVER OF COMMONS. AND AS WE HAVE WATCHED ALMONDS MOVE NOT JUST FROM BEING A LUXURY. SNAP CROP TO BEING A VERY STRONG BASIS OF A PLANT BASED DIET WITH ALL THE WAYS THAT ALMONDS ARE NOW USED AS WELL AS OTHER TREE NUTS AND OTHERS. THERE HAS BEEN A NEW FOR ECONOMIC REASONS AS WELL AS THE ALMOND BOARD OF CALIFORNIA HAS A VERY ROBUST SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE PROGRAM. THEY HAS THAT GOAL BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF WATER USED TO PRODUCE A POUND OF ALMONDS BY TWENTY PERCENT. THEY SET A SUSTAINABILITY GO BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. CHIU IMPROVE THE USE OF ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY PEST MANAGEMENT TOOLS BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. THEY HAVE SET A GOAL TO REDUCE WASTE FROM THE ORCHARDS. ZERO ZERO SO THEY ARE MAKING VERITIES SALE. ON SUSTAINABILITY BOTH IN THAT AND IN THAT REGARD AS HAS OUR DAIRY INDUSTRY JERRY HAS REDUCED ITS- USE OF WATER TO PRODUCE A. GALLON OF MILK BY 88% OVER THE LAST FEW CLASS PROCESSING OF IMPROVED THEIR WATER EFFICIENCY SO THAT THEY USE PERCENT LESS Y. BUT THEY AND THEIR BY PERCENT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF RATIOS THAT ALLOW FOR LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY. OF CROPS THAT CAN'T BE GRANTED THAT MANY OTHER PLACES. I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO MEET WITH YOU AT ANY TIME TO TALK MORE ABOUT OUR SUSTAINABLE ACT PROGRAMS AND OUR CLIMATE SMART ACT PROGRAMS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT. THE WAY THAT WE GROW THESE ARE MORE EFFICIENT THAN ANY OTHER ACTION SYSTEM THAT I NOW UP ON A GLOBAL BASIS THANKS FOR. THANK YOU SECRETARY WE HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION. SCHOLAR THANK THANK YOU MISTER AND I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND THE QUESTION OF WHICH STATE ARE CALLING GIVE FOR. YOUR CONCERN BUT HONESTLY WE TO HEAR ABOUT HOW MUCH THE MEAT AND DAIRY INDUSTRY USES. ARE NOT JUST IN TERMS OF WATER BUT IN TERMS GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND SO- I DO- AND HAD WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON. LEGISLATION TO HELP- YOU KNOW THE- A- TRANSITION FOR THOSE THAT ARE INTERESTED- TO VOTE MORE TOWARDS PLANT BASED AND SUSTAINABLE. PLANT BASED PLANT BASED MEANS A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS. IN TERMS OF OUR- PLANTS AND VEGETABLES AND FRUITS THAT. WE GROW- WHICH WE'VE GROW BETTER THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD WHICH IS A GREAT THING AND I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HEAR ABOUT. OTHER CONTINUED EFFORTS BY OUR AGRICULTURE INDUSTRY ACROSS THE BOARD- TO REDUCE. WATER CONSUMPTION. AND YOUR ANY THOUGHTS OR OR AT LEAST- I'LL JUST PUT IT OUT THERE IN TERMS OF- THAT CONTINUED MOVE TOWARDS MORE SUSTAINABLE. TYPES OF CROPS WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO NOT JUST HERE BUT GLOBALLY AND IS BEEN RECOGNIZED. ON A GLOBAL LEVEL IN TERMS OF HOW OUR CURRENT. FOOD SYSTEM IS ABSOLUTELY UNSUSTAINABLE- AND THAT HAS MORE TO DO WITH- WITH- WITH A- LARGE LIVESTOCK WOULD HAVE YOU THAN ANYTHING ELSE NOT JUST HERE BUT GLOBALLY BUT OF COURSE WE CAN. FOCUS ON WHAT WE NEED TO DO HERE THANK GOODNESS BECAUSE AWARD TO IF WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM- THE COLLEAGUES HERE WE'RE GONNA JUMP INTO THE- SECOND PANEL BEFORE WE DO THAT. THANK ALL THREE OF OUR OUR PRESENTERS. WE HAVE OKAY WE HAVE ONE MICROPHONE GOING UP. SOME MEMBER AGUIAR-CURRY MUCH EITHER OF YOU HAVE MANY WAY I THANK YOU VERY MUCH CAN'T A I REALLY APPRECIATE- KERN WHEN YOU'VE SHARED WITH EVERYONE I WANT TO BE THE FIRST TO SAY I'LL TAKE YOU ON A TOUR AND I THINK YOU'RE GOING TO BE SHOCKED THIS THE THINGS THAT FARMERS ARE DOING. YOU KNOW I'M GONNA BE THE FIRST TO MID IS A FARMER I'M A TIGHT WAD AND I LOOK FOR EVERY WAY TO SAVE MONEY I LOOK EVERYWHERE TO SAVE WATER I LOOK FOR THE GOOD OF THE CROPS THAT OBVIOUSLY ARE OF HIGHER VALUE BECAUSE I HAVE TO MAKE A LIVING ON A SMALL EIGHTY ACRE RANCH WITH MY BROTHERS SO I THINK THAT- I FEEL A LITTLE BIT TAKEN BACK HERE ABOUT- A LITTLE BIT NOT EVEN MAYBE I HAVEN'T REACHED OUT TO ENOUGH OF YOU TO TAKE YOU ON A TOUR TO SEE WHAT FARMERS ARE DOING. RIGHT NOW IN THE MIDDLE OF TAUGHT TOMATO HARVEST AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING IS HELP WITH THE HOURS OF THAT THAT THEY WORK OUT THEIR HOW THEY HAVE HOW THEY WATER WHY BROADBAND IS SO IMPORTANT SO THEY CAN MAKE SURE THAT THEY DON'T USE TOO MUCH WATER THE READING I CALCULATE THAT OUT I MEAN THERE'S SO MANY THINGS I THINK THAT UNFORTUNATELY- NOT ALL OF YOU UNDERSTAND. AND I AM MORE THAN WILLING TO TAKE YOU TO ANY TOWARD THE YOU'D LIKE ONLY THIRTY MINUTES AWAY AND YOU CAN SEE SOME OF THE INCREDIBLE THINGS ARE DOING UC DAVIS IS ONE OF THE TOP NOTCH GO UNIVERSITY AND THEY'RE DOING- INCREDIBLE THINGS OF MATH THING HOUSE DERRY AND I JUST THINK THAT WE'RE NOT TAPPING INTO THEM ENOUGH SO THAT YOU UNDERSTAND THAT THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SUSTAINABLE AND I AS A FARMER- I WILL TELL YOU THAT EVERY FARMER I KNOW. IS. ALWAYS TRYING TO FIND A BETTER WAY TO DO BUSINESS THANK YOU SOME AND THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS AND- AGAIN FOR- THREE PANELISTS. FOR BEING WITH US TODAY AND PROVIDING THE INSIGHT. MY COLLEAGUES ARE CHAIRMAN RIVAS WILL. PRESENT THE- NEXT PANELIST AND THAT CLOSURES SOME OF IT ON THE SECOND PANEL- WILL BE TALKING ABOUT US DROUGHT IMPACTS ON FARMERS AND RANCHERS THE FIRST ON THE PANEL IS- MISS JENNIFER. BERETTA OF- THE BREAD UP FAMILY DAIRY FROM SANTA ROSA SO MISBRANDED HERE WITH US IT'S- IT'S ALL YOURS THANK YOU KNOW SOMEONE REQUESTS- MY NAME IS JENNIFER BERETTA I'M A FOURTH GENERATION DAIRY FARMER IN THE NORTH COAST IN SANTA ROSA- I ALSO IN A SIX GENERATION FARMER IN MARIN COUNTY SO BOTH OF OUR FARMS. ARE EXPERIENCING THE DROUGHT IN DIFFERENT WAYS SO I'M GONNA TALK ON THAT TODAY I'M IN CENTER THAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING SINCE NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT. AND WE WERE ORGANIC IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX- KNOWING THAT WE CAN NO LONGER COMPETE- IN THE BIGGER MARKET AND IN THE NORTH COAST WE ARE MORE- IS THAT MORE NICHE AND WE ARE PASSED YOUR BE SCARY. WE CURRENTLY SELL REMOTE TO CLOVER SO NO MATTER- AS WELL AS MY MOM'S JERRY IN MARIN COUNTY. WHICH IS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND ACRES OF DRYLAND FARMING AND NOT THEY DEPEND ON RAIN WATER TO CAPTURE INTO THEIR DAMS TWO WATER TOWERS AND WASH THE BAR DOWN- WE'VE BEEN THROUGH DROUGHT FOR THE LAST YOU KNOW TWELVE. OF SEVENTY YEARS MY UNCLE SAID THAT- IN SEVENTY SEVEN I WAS THE FIRST TIME THEY HAD A WHOLE WATER AND HE HASN'T HAD A WHOLE WATER SINCE AN HOUR IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE- WE SAW IN DECEMBER THAT THERE WAS NOT GOING TO BE ANY RUN OFF THIS YEAR AND WE DECIDED TO START SELLING SOME COWS. KNOWING THATFEED COSTS WERE GOING TO BE HIGHER- ARE CASHIER WAS NOT GOING TO BE WHAT IT SHOULD BE- AND WE USE IT HERE IN SANTA ROSA AND THE CITY OF SANTA ROSA RECLAIMED WASTEWATER- AND THAT'S BEEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP FOR THIRTY YEARS AND I WE GOT OUR INCHES CUT IN HALF- SAID KNOWING THAT ALL THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO BE COMING DOWN THE PIPELINE WE HAD TO MAKE SOME VERY- HARD CALLS. I'M AS WELL AS BE VERY DILIGENT AROUND US- WE ARE SURROUNDED BY CITY SANTA ROSA PROPERTY THAT NORMALLY IF YOU'RE GETTING IT AND- LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AGO WE HAD A FIRE ACROSS THE STREET. THAT ALMOST TOOK OUT OUR DAIRY AND HAVE THOSE LANDS BEEN YOUR GATED- I FEEL LIKE THAT WOULD HAVE SLOWED THE PROGRESS- BUT- WITHOUT WATER OBVIOUSLY RUNNING OFF TO THE PINES- WE DO NOT HAVE THAT WATER AVAILABLE FOR ALL THAT ACREAGE- WE. RELY ON GROWING MOST OF HER FEET. WE THE GIRL ABOUT HOW ACRES SILENT AND THEN TRY TO GO A SET AND THIRD HAY THIS YEAR WE'RE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE. TRUCKING IN MORE HEY WE'VE HAD TO FEED OUR ANIMALS SOONER THAN NORMAL- BECAUSE OUR PASTURE LAND IS NOT WHAT IT SHOULD BE- FEED COSTS ARE. FLYING THROUGH THE ROOF- AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE HARDER FOR US TO. CONTINUE TO JERRY AND I FEEL LIKE THE IMPACTS ON THE DAIRY INDUSTRY IN THE NORTH COAST. HAVE YET TO BE SEEN IF WE DON'T GET RAIN IN THE WINTER TIME YOU WILL PROBABLY SEE MULTIPLE JERRY SPOT OF BUSINESS- BECAUSE THERE'S JUST PHYSICALLY NO WATER TO WATER THEIR ANIMALS. AND NO FEE DEFEAT THEM- ALSO ON THE U. TRUCKING AND FEED YOU KNOW WE IN THE DAIRY INDUSTRY HAVE TRY TO CUT EMISSIONS BY METHANE AND WE DO ALL THAT WE CAN BUT AS WE'RE TRACKING AND MORE FEET FROM OTHER STATES. ARE DOING IS INCREASING OUR MISSION BUT BRAND THAT'S NOT WHAT WE HAVE THE DAIRY INDUSTRY HAS TRIED TO DO- SO. WE ALSO DID EIGHT EYES CDFA WE ARE ONE OF THE CDFA IMPRINT THIS YEAR. AND WE'VE SEEN THE BENEFITS AND NOT AS WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REUSE A SEPARATED WATER OFF OF ARE SEPARATED IN YOUR BACK ONTO OUR FIELDS. SO THAT'S BEEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP WE ALSO DID THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM AND I WOULD LIKE TO KIND OF TOUCH ON WHAT SECRETARY ROSS TALKED ABOUT WITH ALL THE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING. I WOULD HAVE TO SAY THAT AS WE PUSH THESE PROGRAMS- TO HOPEFULLY. HOLD OUR CDFA ACCOUNTABLE AND HOLD USD ACCOUNTABLE BECAUSE THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM. WAS ONE OF THE HARDEST PROGRAMS I'VE EVER DEALT WITH NOT ONLY TO GET OUR FUNDS. BUT WHEN IT CAME TO DURING KOBE TIME JUST GETTING A RESPONSE BACK. FROM WHO I WAS WORKING WITH AND USDA WE'VE HAD FUN SITTING OUT FOR DROUGHT- FOR THE LAST FIVE MONTHS WE HAVE NOT GOT ANY OF OUR FUNDS SO THESE PROGRAMS ARE GREAT. BUT I REALLY STRIVED ACT- THE STATE AND CDFA PUSH- THAT THEY'RE EASIER FOR FARMERS. AND I'M NOT THERE YOU KNOW EASIER FOR US TO GET OUR FUNDS- I CALLED ACTION. FOR THE COMMUNITY TO THINK ABOUT HOW WE CAN TAKE MOST OF THIS REGIONALLY. I TALK ABOUT- RECLAIM. WASTEWATER SYSTEM WE USE FOR THIRTY YEARS HOW CAN WE BY HOW CAN WE YOU DON'T OUR FOR OUR FARMLAND GIVEN THAT WAS CUT IN HALF BUT- URBAN AND THE GEYSERS WERE HALF OF THAT WATER GOES FOR ELECTRICITY WAS NOT CUT. BUT WHAT WE DO ON OUR FARMERS WE RECHARGE THE GROUND BY UTILIZING THAT WATER IRRIGATION. AND THAT LESSENS THE AMOUNT OF WATER WE PULL OUT OF THE GROUND. WE HAVE NOT YOUR GATED FROM AWHILE IN OVER THIRTY YEARS SO I REALLY STRIVE TO. WORK REGIONALLY WITH SOME OF OUR CLAIM WASTE WATER SYSTEMS. AND REALLY LOOK AT IS THIS WATER SUSTAINABLE GOING TO URBAN OR GOING UP FOR HYDRO ELECTRICITY- HOW CAN ME REVAMPED SOME OF OUR WATER QUALITY. I'M RULES ON THE JERRY SIDE- FOR YEARS IT WAS. YOU KNOW SEND CLEAN WATER OFF THE FARM- BUT HOW CAN WE CAPTURE THAT RAIN WATER INTO. INTO OUR DAMS. INTO SOMETHING- HOLDING FACILITIES SO WE COULD UTILIZE THAT BACK TOGETHER WASHER CORRALS. OR WATER ANIMALS. AND ALSO YOU KNOW TAKING DOWN SOME OF THE RED TAPE WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. CAN WE CLEAN OUT SOME OF OUR DAMS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE ON FARM. FOR EXAMPLE. ARE DERIAN MORAN WERE LOOKING TO CLEAN OR NOT CLEAN IT OUT TO HAVE IT A LITTLE BIT. BIGGER STORAGE JUST OVER THE YEARS SETTLEMENT AND JULIE'S OUT OF GROWN. AND ALSO- YOU KNOW JUST. AS WELL AS SOME OF OUR MENU UPON TALKING TO MAYBE TURN THOSE INTO YOU OR BUILD NEW ONES. BUILD NEW CASH MEANT FOR WATER- AND ALSO REGIONAL FUNDING WOULD BE GREAT- LET'S BRING SOME OF THOSE FUNDS REGIONALLY AND DO SOME GREAT PROJECTS. ON WATER STORAGE. THANK YOUNG MISS BRETT WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY AND- AS ALWAYS APPRECIATE YOU JOINING US- I KNOW YOUR FATHER WAS AT A- A PREVIOUS HEARING OF OURS EARLIER IN THE YEAR AND SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE ALL THAT- YOUR YOUR FAMILY DO A SECOND- MEMBER THIS PANEL IS JEFF MAIN WITH GOOD HOMINIS FARM JEFF IF YOU WITH US- DAHLE YOURS YEAH WE'RE HERE FIVE R. ONE INTRODUCE YOU ALL TO MY DAUGHTER WHO'S PART OF THE TRANSITION OF OUR FARM FROM THE FIRST GENERATION THE SECOND GENERATION- AND SHE'LL START PRESENTATION. YEAH FIVE WE WANT TO FIRST THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR A CONSIDERATION OF TESTIMONY FROM CALIFORNIA SMALL FAMILY FARMERS FACING THE DIFFICULTIES OF FARMING WITH DIMINISHING WATER RESOURCES AND CLIMATE CHANGE WELL WE WANT TO ALSO EXTEND OUR THANKS TO DAVE RAMSDEN AND THE COMMUTER LINE TO FAMILY FARMERS FROM BOTH THE ADVOCACY AND SUPPORT THEY HAVE PROVIDED OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS. UP FOR SMALL FARMS STATEWIDE AND FOR OF COURSE REPRESENT- PRESENTING TODAY THE PROPOSAL- TO GOVERNOR GOVERNOR NEWSOM AND THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE FOR RELIEF FUNDS FOR FAMILY FARMERS WHOSE WORK IS BEING THREATENED BY THE DROUGHT WE ARE AWARE THAT OUR TESTIMONY WILL NOT EVEN BEGIN TO DESCRIBE THE BREADTH AND THE DEPTH OF THE PHYSICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DAMAGE BEING DONE TO OUR LOCAL ARM AND FOOD COMMUNITIES BY THIS DROUGHT- BUT WE FEEL IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT WE APPEAR BEFORE YOU TODAY BECAUSE OUR STORY IS RELEVANT- AS PART OF A OF A MUCH BROADER CRISIS SHE WAS AN INTEGRAL PART OF THAT STORY- MY WIFE AND I STARTED COULD YOU MUST PRODUCE- FORTY SIX YEARS AGO. AND I NOW COME TO THE- IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE WITH A FORTY SIX YEAR CAREER. ARE PRODUCING- ORGANIC PRODUCE IN WESTERN HELLO COUNTY WE I'M CURRENTLY A MEMBER OF A FIVE PERSON FAMILY FARM PARTNERSHIP.THAT NOW RUNS THE BUSINESS OKAY ARE PRODUCING ABOUT A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FRESH FRUIT FRESH VEGETABLES AND FLOWERS FOR YOUR COUNTY AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY ALL OF OUR PRODUCE IS ARE PRETTY IS PRETTY MUCH IN THOSE TWO COUNTS ARE WE ALL DO THAT WE DO THIS FROM A TWENTY ACRE PARCEL IN WESTERN A LOT COUNTY WHICH IS PART OF THE REASON WHY WE'VE BEEN BROUGHT HERE TODAY. JUST TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT OUR TIES TO THE COMMUNITY WHICH ARE. ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF OUR FARM IS WE'VE BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN IN. HELPING START DAVIS FOOD COOP THE DAVIS FARMERS MARKET IN WHICH WE'VE SOLD FOR- FORTY SOME YEARS. AND MY WIFE IS HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN STARTING ON THE YELLOW- ARTNET PROGRAM AND THE YOLO COUNTY FARM TO SCHOOL CHILDREN'S EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THEY ARE AN ESSENTIAL PART OF WIRE THAT ILLUSTRATES OUR BELIEF IN THE FUTURE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE FROM SMALL FARMERS IT IS THAT WE HAVE- WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE SACRAMENTO FOOD COOP THE SUPPORT OF THE DAVIS FOOD COOP IN SUPPORT OF LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF CITIZENS IN THE SACRAMENTO YOLO COUNTY AREA. WE'VE BEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PUT AN AFFIRMATIVE. AGRICULTURAL EASEMENT ON OUR LAND THAT CURRENTLY. MAKES IT AVAILABLE FOR- THE NEXT GENERATION OF FARMERS YEAH AND MY RED TO BECOMING THE NEXT GENERATION HEARING GOOD HUMUS- BEGAN AFTER EIGHT YEARS ON THE EAST COAST- AND I RETURNED TO THE FARM TO CONTINUE MY PARENTS WORK AND LAND STEWARDSHIP AND FOOD PRODUCTION- I LIVED IN NEW YORK I LIVED IN BOSTON BUT REALLY FIND MYSELF YEARNING TO BE BACK HERE- WITH THE LAND AND- BEING A PART OF SOMETHING THAT GIVES BACK TO THE PLANET. AND THE PEOPLE HERE IN A REALLY POSITIVE WAY- AND CONNECTING TO THE COMMUNITY THAT I GREW UP IN- WHICH IS LED BY ENTREPRENEURS AND PEOPLE WHO REALLY MOTIVATED TO REINVEST THEIR PROFITS. IN THE FUTURE FOR ALL OF US HERE- IT'S A COMMUNITY OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE TIME AND AGAIN- SEEING WHAT'S HAPPENING AROUND US AND WORKED REALLY REALLY HARD TO REIMAGINE WHAT THE FUTURE CAN LOOK LIGHT. I'M IN THAT IS SO IMPORTANT- THEY DID THIS WITH THE ORGANIC FOOD MOVEMENT IN THE SEVENTIES THE LOCAL FOOD MOVEMENT IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND ARE CURRENTLY BEING CONFRONTED WITH THE CHALLENGES. OF FARMING AND PRODUCING- IN THE FACE OF EXTREME DROUGHT AND CLIMATE CHANGE- SO YEAH THAT THAT TIME WE REALLY MADE ME REALIZE HOW UNIQUE FAMILY FARMS ARE AND SMALL FAMILY FARMS AND THE IMPACT OF THE WORK THAT THEY CAN DO HERE ON THE GROUND AND SO AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS TO INVEST IN THAT AND IN OUR COMBAT SURVIVAL OF THOSE FARMS- I RETURNED TO NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE I AM. INVESTED IN CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE I RETURNED WITH THE DREAM OF CONTINUING OUR WORK HERE- FOR A SECOND GENERATION- BUT TODAY WE REALLY FEEL THAT FUTURE IS BEING THREATENED IT'S BEING THREATENED BY THE DROUGHT. BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND BY INVESTMENT AGRICULTURE- WHICH IS PUSHING FOR PROFIT TODAY WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION. WHATSOEVER- FOR WHAT TOMORROW CAN BRING AND SO IT APPEARS TODAY THAT MY FUTURE AND MY FUTURE HERE GOOD HUMUS AND- IS DEPENDENT ON THE ACTION FOR THE LEADERSHIP. TO PRIORITIZE THE NEEDS OF THE SMALL FAMILY FARM HERE. RA I THINK YOU MAY WONDER WHY WERE TALKIES SO MUCH OF OUR COMMUNITY AND- THE NEEDS OF OUR SMALL FARMERS BUT IT'S OUR IT'S OUR BELIEF THAT THE DROP IN ITSELF IS TERRIBLE BUT- THE FORM THAT WE TAKE IN PRODUCING THE FIRM THAT WE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA AND FOR THE- AND FOR THE INTERNATIONAL. THE FORM THAT OUR AGRICULTURE TAKES IS ESSENTIAL. IS ESSENTIAL TO WHAT CALIFORNIA WILL LOOK LIKE IN THE FUTURE IN THE LIGHT OF THESE KIND OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS SO WE YOU KNOW FOR PERSONAL SITUATION WE FEEL LIKE A FARM UNDER SIEGE RIGHT NOW. WITH OUR WATER SITUATION SINCE OUR DOMESTIC WELL WENT DRY A COUPLE YEARS AGO WE'VE BEEN RELYING ON OUR AGRICULTURAL WELL TO PROVIDE WATER FOR BOTH OUR DOMESTIC NEEDS AND OUR CULTURAL NEEDS THERE AT THE STATUS THAT AGRICULTURE WELL IS. IS IN DANGER- AND WE ARE BY. WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF FUTURE POSSIBILITIES OF THIS FARM IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SEVEN OUR WATER STOOD AT A HUNDRED FEET BELOW GROUND WATER BELOW GROUND LEVEL. RIGHT BY THE END OF THE DIRE DROWNED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN INSTEAD OF A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY ONE- FEET BELOW GROUND LEVEL THIS BY RIGHT AROUND TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ANOTHER FACTOR CAME INTO- INTO FOCUS I WANT TO. TALK TO YOU IN A MOMENT BUT THE LAST POINT OF REFERENCE FOR OUR PARTICULAR ROLES WITHIN THE LAST TWO MONTHS IS DROPPED ANOTHER TWENTY FIVE FEET. WHICH IS OUR OUR FULLY A QUARTER OF WHAT IT DROPPED IN THE FIRST IN THE LAST TWENTY YEARS THAT'S THE RESULTS I'M SURE OF THIS DROUGHT BUT ANOTHER THING OF WHICH THERE WAS SOME ENCOURAGING TO HEAR AT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEMBER FROM FARMS. OR HAS VERY LITTLE AGRICULTURAL BACKGROUND. TALK ABOUT- D. R. D. TYPE OF AGRICULTURE THAT CALIFORNIA MIGHT PRACTICE. THE GREATEST DISAPPOINTMENT FOR US HAS BEEN BE TOMORROW OR A WATER CRISIS IN OUR AREA BY THE AGGRESSIVE MULTINATIONAL INVESTMENT BY AGRIBUSINESS CULTURE IT HAS BEEN IMPOSSIBLE NOT TO NOTICE. THAT THE LOWERING OUR OF OUR WATER TABLE FROM THE COMBINED EXTRACTIONS OF THE- MASSIVE DEEP AND MASSIVE AGRICULTURAL PUMPS THAT SERVICE THE LITERALLY THOUSANDS OF ACRES OF. ALMONDS OLIVES GRAPES AND PISTACHIOS IN THE PREVIOUSLY I'M HERE AGAIN LANDS BETWEEN OFFICE AND COLUSA IN THE HILL LANDS BETWEEN US AND COLUSA. AND THAT UNFORTUNATELY LINE RIGHT OVER THE SOURCE OF OUR ACT OF THE Y. RIGHT IN THE DIRECTION OF OUR AQUIFERS AS AN INDICATOR. AS AN INDICATOR OF THAT. OTHER PEOPLE ARE NOTICING THIS WE'VE BEEN TOLD THAT THERE IS A CRIED BUT- THERE'S A PROVIDE A PRIVATE PROPOSAL IN FRONT OF A LOCAL GOVERNING WATER BOARD. TO PROVIDE WATER TO HUNDREDS OF ACRES OF CURRENTLY I NEAR GATED LAND THE TO THAT WILL BE DEVELOPED THROUGH A PIPELINE FROM AN EXISTING SOURCE THAT WILL THEN BE DEVELOPED FOR THE FURTHER. ON PLANTING OF OLIVES AND GRAPES IN OUR AREA NOW WE ALL I THINK WE ALL CAN UNDERSTAND THE ARM REST WITH WHICH WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS NOT GOING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR- GROUNDWATER SYSTEM WE'RE ALL FAMILIAR WITH. SOUTHERN SAN WALKING EVEN IN OTHER AREAS. SO THIS WHAT WHAT WE SEE HERE ARE HAPPENING AROUND US IS KIND OF REALLY SIMILAR TO OUR MANY POINTS IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY WERE SMALL FARMS SMALL FAMILY FARMS HOUSE THEIR SURVIVAL HAS BEEN DEPENDENT ON FACTORS IN POWERS MUCH LARGER THAN THEY THEN THERE'S- AND THIS SEEMS LIKE TO BE PARTICULARLY TRUE AT THIS TIME THE POWER ON BOTH SIDES OF THE FENCE IS ON THE FENCE IS BEYOND ALMOST BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO COMPREHEND THE SMALL FARMERS. BUT WHAT THAT'S WHY WE DEPEND ON PEOPLE WHITE THE COMMITTEES THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE AND AN ADVANCED ADVOCACY GROUPS LIKE THE COMMUNITY ALLIANCE FOR FAMILY FARMERS THAT KEEP OUR ISSUES IN FRONT OF YOUR WE DEPEND ON THEM SO WE'RE ASKING- THE COMMITTEES AND THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE UP THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE. US ARE A FEW MOMENTS OF RESPITE FOR SMALL FARMERS AS WE TRY TO GET THROUGH THEY REALLY DRASTIC REDUCTIONS IN WATER AVAILABILITY. THAT WE'RE WE'RE SEEING ON IN FRONT OF US NOW. THANK YOU YEAH YEAH SKEWS ME IN CONCLUSION WE JUST WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEES AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME AND PATIENCE IN HEARING OUR TESTIMONY. AND HOPE THAT WE HAVE ADDED TO THE CASE FOR THE MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF FARMING POPULATIONS THAT SERVER THAT ARE PART OF THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND ECONOMIES IN CALIFORNIA HERE- AND HOPE THAT WE HAVE VERY CLEARLY STATED THAT THE REQUESTED FUNDING IS ESSENTIAL IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AS A- TEMPORARY MEASURE THAT WILL KEEP WATER FLOWING. ONTO THE FARMS THAT GROW IN THE FUTURE- THAT YOU AND EVERY CITIEN OF CALIFORNIA- SHOULD BE ABLE TO EAT TONIGHT THANK YOU. THANKS FOR THAT TESTIMONY AND- ALL THE INFORMATION OUR NEXT PANELIST DANIEL HARTWIG WITH WOLF FARMING LOCATED FRESNO THE DANIEL IF YOU'RE WITH US YOU MAY BEGIN THANK YOU ARE CHAIRMAN RIVAS AND- THEY COULD SHARE GARCIA'S FALL FOR THIS I HEARING I STATED I'M DANIEL HARTWIG AND I WORK FOR WILL FARMING I'M ALSO THE- PRESIDENT OF THE FRESNO COUNTY FARM BUREAU- THE BATTLE BACKGROUND ABOUT OUR FARMING OPERATION I WAS STARTED BY JACK WALKED IN NINETEEN SEVENTY FOUR IT'S A FAMILY. OWNED AND OPERATED FARM- AS STATED PREVIOUSLY LOCATED ON THE WEST SIDE OF FRESNO COUNTY. OUR GROWERS OF TOMATOES ALMONDS PISTACHIOS GARLIC- COTTON I LIVE IN A WEAK MOMENT WHEN THERE'S WATER- WHICH- AND RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE THAT'S A LITTLE BIT TRICKY- BUT PREVIOUSLY YOUR PREVIOUS TO BEING ABLE TO GROW THOSE CROPS- WE WERE YOUNG. WE WERE BEFORE THE C. B. P. WAS DEVELOPED THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT- THE OTHER GROWERS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE VALLEY WERE WERE LIMITED TO GROWING YOU KNOW COTTON- GRAIN CROPS IN A LITTLE BIT OF BALANCES WELL- YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF SERVICE WATER DELIVERIES TO OUR REGION CAN'T BE- CAN'T BE OVERSTATED. THE SERVICE WATER DELIVERIES YOU KNOW REALLY ALLOW US TO GROW THESE HIGH VALUE CROPS- THAT- THAT REALLY SUPPORT YOUR NUMBER OF JOBS AND SUPPORT A LOT OF SMALL COMMUNITIES AS WELL. WELL FORMING THE CERTIFIED B. CORP LIKE TO TALK A BIT ABOUT THE SUSTAINABILITY PORTION OF THINGS- YEAH WE'RE CERTIFIED B. CORP MEANING THAT WE MEASURE AND EVALUATE OUR DECISIONS BASED ON SUSTAINABILITY AND YOU KNOW. MAKING SURE THEY WERE MAKING OUR DECISIONS THAT ARE BASED ON FACTORS LIKE THE COMMUNITY- FACT LIKE OUR WATER USE FACTORS LIKE OUR WASTE- FACTORS LIKE OUR EMISSIONS AND THINGS LIKE THAT- WE WORK REALLY HARD TO- TO MAKE SURE THE WORTH OF VISIONS POSSIBLE WITH THOSE. ARE TALKING A BIT ABOUT THIS YEAR'S CONDITIONS OUT WE STARTED OUT WITH A WITH WHAT WAS A 5% WATER ALLOCATION OF SURFACE WATER- YOU WHICH WASN'T HURT MUCH WHEN YOU'RE ONLY WHEN YOU'RE ONLY ALLOWED ABOUT TWO AND A HALF FEET OF WATER- FROM ITS SURFACE WATER. DELIVERIES- BUT THEN THAT WOULD I THOUGHT ZERO. AND YOUR MOM AT THAT CREATES A LOT OF PROBLEMS ZERO WATER MEANS WE HAVE TO RELY ON OUR ARMED YOUR STAVING ACCOUNT AS LECTURER FOR TO OUR TO OUR AQUIFER'S I REFER TO AS A SAVINGS ACCOUNT BECAUSE- REALLY YOU KNOW THE SURFACE WATER LIKE A CHECKING ACCOUNT LIKE REVENUE THAT'S COMING IN EVERY MONTH- AND THEN SOMETIMES WHEN THAT WHEN THAT FALL SHORT YOU HAVE TO TURN TO YOUR TO YOUR SAVINGS ACCOUNTS- BUT WITH CIGNA COMING AND THAT THAT'S THAT'S GOING TO BE- A HUGE CHALLENGE FOR US OTHERS CAN BE A LOT LESS THAN THAT SAVINGS ACCOUNT AS WELL- WE FOUND OUT WE WERE GETTING ZERO WATER- THE OBVIOUSLY LOOKED AT TO TRY TO GET MORE. YOU KNOW WATER TRANSFERS- TO COME IN- YOUNG AND SEEING IF ANYBODY OUTSIDE OUR WATER DISTRICT MIGHT HAVE WANTED TO WE COULD BRING IN- BUT THERE WAS NO FLEXIBILITY THERE THERE'S VERY LITTLE YOU KNOW WATER- LIQUIDITY- SO TO SPEAK- THAN THAT WITHIN THE MARKET. AND THAT WILL WATER THERE WAS- IT'S JUST SELLING FOR UNSUSTAINABLE RATES YOU CAN'T GROW CROP ON ON TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR WATER IT'S JUST ON FEASIBLE- IN THE END THERE WAS NO LIKE I SAID NO NO REALLY ABILITY WITHIN THE STATE SYSTEM AS WELL TO- TO BRING IN OTHER WATER EVEN WITH THE DROUGHT DECLARATION IN MAY- WHICH BASICALLY WHICH WHICH LEADS WHICH LED US TO- TO THE FACT OF HAVING TO PULL OUT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED ACRES OF ALMONDS. WE MADE THAT DECISION- BACK IN APRIL AND WE HAD TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IT WASN'T AS WE MADE EARLY ON- BUT WE KNEW IF WE HAD TO TRY TO- IF THOSE TREES THIS YEAR- WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO IRRIGATE THE REST OF OUR TREES IN THE REST OF OUR OUR CROPS ARE TOMATOES IN OUR COLUMN. I THINGS LIKE THAT- WE JUST WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH WATER TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT- WHAT WE PULLED OUR FIFTEEN YEAR OLD TREES- AND I'M SURE AS IF ANYBODY'S FAMILIAR WITH THAT- ALMONDS GO FOR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS WHICH MEANS WE GIVE UP- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE PEOPLE DUCTION IN THESE TREES. ARE. KNOWN FUTURE REVENUE BOB THE THEY'RE JUST WASN'T WATER AND IT WHICH IS BETTER WITH THE REST OF OPEN I TO LEAVE HIS THINGS IN THE YOU KNOW AS FAR AS MAKING THE FOR NOW YOU KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT NEXT YEAR IS BEING ANOTHER 0% YEAR- WERE WERE MAKING YOU KNOW MAKING OUR ASSUMPTIONS ON HOW MUCH WE CAN PLANTS- FACTORING INTO WE HAVE NO WATER- NO SURFACE WATER COMING IN. AND WERE YOU KNOW LOOKING AT IT FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT SIGMOD NEW IMPLEMENTATION STARTS NEXT YEAR FOR US AS WELL. ASSORTMENT HAVEN'T MAKE A LOT OF HARD DECISIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT CROSS WE CAN GROW AND HOW MUCH WE CAN GROW AS WELL- AND AGAIN THAT HAS A HUGE OF IMPACT ON ON JOBS- NOT ONLY ON OUR OWN. YOU KNOW ON THE FARM ITSELF BUT IN A IN THE PROCESSING OPERATIONS- THAT ARE ALL THAT YOU KNOW THAT. YOUR DOCTOR THE YOU KNOW THE FORMED THIS WELL- ANYTIME THAT CROPS ARE ABLE TO BE GROUND. THERE'S DOWNSTREAM IMPACTS- THERE WAS NO ANSWER AND IT WILL LOOK TO THE FUTURE OF NEXT YEAR AS WELL AS I DRIVE AROUND THE WEST SIDE I SEE A LOT OF TREES THAT- DIDN'T GET VERY MUCH WATER THIS YEAR. I DIDN'T GET SAID- DEFINITELY GET ENOUGH WATER AND I AM AN AWFUL LOT OF GROWERS- OR THINKING ABOUT EITHER GET FULL INDUSTRIES OUT THIS UPCOMING YEAR. OR IF THEY'RE- YOU KNOW JUST DEFICIT HERE GETTING INTO THE TO THE POINT TO JUST BARELY KEEP THE THING ALIVE BUT- BUT THERE'S GONNA BE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT TO HOW MUCH YOU KNOW WHAT. THE HOME CROWD LOOKS LIKE THE YEAR AND EXTRA AS WELL I'M THINKING ABOUT THE SALUTE YEAH I WAS KIND OF HARDENED IT TO HERE I AM DURING THE FIRST PANEL OF THE YOU KNOW THE CONCEPT OF RECHARGE- RECHARGES IS A HUGE HUGE THING FOR ACROSS HERE IN THE IN THE SOUTHERN SILICON VALLEY- BECAUSE WHEN THAT WATER DOES COME. AYE WE IT COMES IN HUGE FLOCKS AND WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PULL THE WATER OUT OF. RIVERS AND STREAMS IS THERE ANYONE IS THERE YOU KNOW TURNING AND GOING AND MONDAY'S HEAVY STORMS AND ABLE TO STORE THAT WATER- BELOW GROUND ESPECIALLY THROUGH THROUGH RECHARGE PROJECTS- AS WELL AS SOME OF THE WATER THROUGH THE- THROUGH YOU KNOW THROUGH THE DELTA AMPLE YOU KNOW POINT OUT THROUGH. THE CALIFORNIA AQUEDUCT AND OTHER ADVANCES WELL- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO RECHARGE OF GROUNDWATER IN THE IN THE YEARS WE HAVE THAT COULD FLOW- THE OTHER PIECE WITH THE ABOVE GROUND STORAGE AS WELL I NEED THAT WE JUST NEED TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE MORE MORE THAT WATER. WHEN IT'S AVAILABLE- YEAH I THINK WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE- YEAH WE TALK ABOUT THE WATER IS GOIN TO COME DOWN YEAH MORE AS RAIN- THAT MEANS WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO HAVE MORE STORAGE TO BE ABLE TO CAPTURE THAT IT'S NOT GONNA FALL IT'S NOT GONNA MELT SNOW MELTS AS IT HAS IN THE PAST SO WE HAVE TO YOU. TAKE DIFFERENT SAID TAKE A DIFFERENT TACK TO ME OUT OF PREVIOUSLY I JUST I LIKE TO SEE A MORE COOPERATION BETWEEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STATE ARE USING SNOW SCIENCE BASED APPROACH AS WELL- YEAH. I WAS REALLY SAD TO SEE THE STATE YOU KNOW SUE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT- YOU KNOW WHAT THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS- WHEN THOSE OPINIONS OUR LEAD ARE TAKING MORE SCIENCE BASED APPROACH RATHER THAN A CALENDAR BASED APPROACH- TO LOOKING AT- YOU KNOW HOW MUCH WATER CAN BE MOVED THROUGH THE DELTA THROUGH THE PUMPS THERE- YOU KNOW WHEN I'M PERFORMING I MAKING DECISIONS ON. YOUR ASIAN I'M LOOKING AT YOU KNOW SOIL MOISTURE DATA I'M LOOKING AT MY TREES YEAH LOOK AT THE STRESS THERE- I'M LOOKING A WHOLE. HOST OF DIFFERENT FACTORS NO FUTURE WHETHER AND I'M TAKING ALL THOSE IN THE CAN I DO JUST LOOK AT A CALENDAR AND SAY WELL IT'S YOU KNOW AUGUST TWENTY- I SHOULD MODERN THE TREES ITS YOU KNOW IT'S A DIFFERENT IT'S THAT MUCH MORE SCIENCE BASED APPROACH. I'M NOT SPREAD OUT THE SEEDS FROM- FROM THE FROM THE STATE THE FEDERAL. SAYS THERE. SO THAT'S THAT'S ALL I HAVE TO SAY ON THE ON THIS- AND I'LL TAKE IT BUT LATER ON BUT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS INFORMATION. THANK YOU MISTER HART WE WERE REALLY DAY TEST AND OUR FINAL PANELIST IS VICKY ESPINOZA BUT THE UC MERCED VIC IF YOU'RE WITH US YOU MAY BEGIN. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME TODAY- MY NAME STICKY ESPINOZA I'M A PHD CANDIDATE AT UC MERCED AND ON THE WORK THAT I'M DOING FOR MY DISSERTATION IS TO DEVELOP A LANDER PURPOSING MODEL THAT INCORPORATES AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY INPUT IN ORDER TO MINIMIZE- IMPACTS TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND SMALL SCALE GROWERS I'VE ALSO DEVELOPED A TRILINGUAL CHANNEL CALLED COUNTY WATER AG. AND IT'S FOR OUR COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND GROWERS TO REALLY LEARN ABOUT POLICIES LIKE CIGNA AND IT REALLY HELPS EXPLAIN THE SCIENCE AND POLICY BEHIND CALIFORNIA WATER AND AGRICULTURE. SO TODAY I'D LIKE TO BEGIN WITH JUST A BRIEF REVIEW OF THE TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY SIXTEEN DROUGHT IMPACTS FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN CALIFORNIA AND I'D LIKE TO GIVE CREDIT TO RUTH DAHLQUIST WILLARD WITH UC AGRICULTURE AND NATURAL RESOURCES. SO SHE CONDUCTED A SURVEY OF SIXTY EIGHT SOUTH EAST ASIAN FARMERS AND. FRESNO. AND SO SOME OF THE IMPACTS THAT WERE SEEN IN TERMS OF IMPACTS TO SMALL SCALE FARMERS WERE. SHALLOW WELLS GOING DRY- A LOT OF THE FARMERS AND FRESNO AREA APPROXIMATELY SURVEYED RELY ON GROUNDWATER ENTIRELY SUGGEST LARGE SCALE IMPACTS INCLUDE LOSS OF WELLS ESPECIALLY SHALLOW WELLS- SHALLOW WELLS CAN TO GO FIRST. AND SHALLOW WELLS ARE OFTEN- OWNED BY A SMALL PORTABLE FARMS THAT DON'T HAVE THE MONEY OR THE RESOURCES TO DIG DEEPER WELLS OTHER ON IMPACTS WERE REDUCED WATER AVAILABILITY TO EVERY KEEP CROPS AND HIGHER ENERGY COSTS FOR GROUNDWATER PUMPING OR JUST OTHER OPERATIONS ON THE FARM AND THIS IS ALSO THIS STUDY ALSO FOUND POTENTIAL MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES WITH HAVING TO DEAL WITH- SURFACE WATER OF REDUCTION AS WELL AS HAVING TO DEAL WITH- MEETING. THOSE RESTRICTIONS THAT ARE BEING SAT ON SOME OF OUR SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN TERMS OF WATER USE. AS WELL AS IMPACTS FOR FOOD SECURITY NOT ONLY FOR THE NATION AND THE STATE BUT FOR IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE SAMPSON COUNTY TRANSICOLD SEE RECOMMENDATIONS- I'VE PERSONALLY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH SEVERAL SMALL SCALE FARMERS THROUGHOUT MY- DOCTORAL RESEARCH HERE EASY MERCED. A LOT OF WHAT I HAVE BEEN SEEING HAS BEEN DEALING WITH INFORMATION EQUITY EQUITY AND ACCESSIBILITY- SO I HIGHLY RECOMMEND AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE MORE FUNDING FOR INFORMATION BEING DEVELOPED IN NON ENGLISH LANGUAGES- THERE ARE A LOT OF MANGA AND CELESTINO FARMERS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. AS WELL AS OTHER ETHNICITIES THAT ARE PRESENT IN THE STATE AND SOME OF THESE FARMERS DON'T HAVE THE SUPPORT FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN TERMS OF- BEING ABLE TO ACCESS FUNDING OR REALLY GETTING THAT HELP THAT THEY NEED IN ORDER TO APPLY FOR FUNDING THAT IS AVAILABLE. AT THE STATE LEVEL AND EVEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN TERMS OF- SERVICES FOR OUR SMALL SCALE GROWERS OFFERING MORE TIGHTENING LEGAL- OR BILINGUAL SERVICES AND STAFF THAT ARE ABLE TO ATTEND MEETINGS TO HELP TRANSLATE THE MATERIAL SO THAT ARE SMALL SCALE FARMERS THAT DON'T SPEAK ENGLISH CAN ALSO BE AWARE OF WHAT'S GOING ON AND BE A PART OF THAT CONVERSATION IN TERMS OF MAKING DECISIONS FOR THEIR FOR THEIR FUTURE IN TERMS OF FINDING- SOME OF THESE ARE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT DOCTOR BOTH DOCTORS WILLARD HAS ALSO EXPRESSED WITH ME AND HAS ALSO WRITTEN A POLICY BRIEF THAT WILL BE PBLISHED SOON- SO SOME OF THE FUNDING COULD BE FOR ONE MEDICATION PROGRAMS FOR DIRECT RELIEF TO SMALL SCALE FARMERS- ESPECIALLY FARMERS MEETING TO DEEPEN WELL OR CHILDREN WHILE. THAT MAY BE COMPLICATED WITH SIGMA BUT- I THINK IT'S SOMETHING TO CONSIDER IN TERMS OF REALLY EXPANDING FUNDING TO INCLUDE SMALL SCALE FARMERS AND MAKE ADJUSTMENTS SO THAT THESE ARE TAILORED MORE TOWARD THAT SMALL FARMER ON ENVIRONMENT AND SITUATIONS FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF CONSERVATION TECHNOLOGY WORK ON CONSERVATION TECHNOLOGY I'VE SPOKEN TO A LOT OF SMALL SCALE GROWERS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN IMPLEMENTING TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS DRIP IRRIGATION BUT THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE FINANCIAL MEANS TO DO SO AT THE MOMENT ESPECIALLY WHEN DEALING WITH DROUGHT AND WATER SHORTAGES AND HAVING TO TRANSITION TO OTHER CONSERVATION TECHNOLOGY IS JUST NOT FINANCIALLY FEASIBLE FOR THEM AT THE MOMENT AS WELL AS- ZERO INTEREST LOANS FOR WELL DRILLING FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS AND I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXTEND THIS FOR TECHNOLOGY THAT COULD HELP SAVE WATER DOWN THE LINE FOR OUR SMALL SCALE FARMERS THERE IS ONE RECOMMENDATION IN TERMS OF- SPECIFICALLY TOWARD THE STATE WATER EFFICIENCY ENHANCEMENT PROGRAM OR THE SWEET PROGRAM. TO INCLUDE LOWER INCOME SHOPS AND DRILLING ON A DEEPER. PROGRAMS FOR DOMESTIC FALL IMPROVEMENTS AND TO SUPPORT BUSINESSES DOMESTIC WELLS. TO IRRIGATE SMALL ACREAGES IN TERMS OF- ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF THEIR PASSED OR REQUEST A RECOMMENDATION TO. TALK TO PG&amp;E OR WORK SOMETHING OUT WITH PG&amp;E AND OTHER ELECTRIC COMPANIES TO MAKE PROFICIENCY REBATES ON ALL BUILT FINANCES IT'S MORE ACCEPTABLE FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS AND AGAIN OFFERING BILINGUAL OR MULTI LINGUAL SERVICES ESPECIALLY WHEN EXPLAINING THESE TYPES OF PROGRAMS SO THAT THEY CAN UNDERSTAND WHAT IS PART OF THAT CONTRACT AND- FUNDS FUNDING I BELIEVE THAT'S ALL I HAVE FOR NOW BUT- I ALSO HAVE- TWO OTHER. AND LIVED EXPERIENCES FROM SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN QUARTERFINAL AND FRESNO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THOSE. WELL HERE WHAT HAPPENED SHARES CLOSED I'M STILL DOESN'T ACTOR ROBERT IMPORTER BILL WHO ACTUALLY GOT IS- ALLOCATION CERTAIN WATER ACT OF OFF. SHORE JANET LEIGH THIS. GROWER WAS ABLE TO. FOR OUT A TRANSIT IN TERMS OF PURCHASING WATER FROM THEIR NEIGHBOR WHO HAS A LARGER PLOT OF LAND- SO THEY WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO DO THAT THIS ISN'T THE CASE FOR EVERY SINGLE FARMER OUT THERE. A LOT OF SMALL SCALE GROWERS. AND THEY JUST MAY NOT HAVE THE MEANS OR THE CONNECTIONS TO OTHERS THAT MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEM WITH SURFACE WATER ALLOCATIONS THAT ARE SURPLUS FOR OTHER GROWERS THIS GROWER WAS INTERESTED IN CONVERTING WATER SINCE- CONVERTING THEIR WATER SYSTEM FROM SPRAY MEASURES TO DRIP IRRIGATION. BUT THEY CURRENTLY CANNOT AFFORD. THAT TRANSITION TO NEW TECHNOLOGY THERE'S A MIXED VEGGIE FARMER IN FRESNO AND CORRECTOR. AND WHO IS GROUND WATER RELIANT AND SO WHEN THEY WERE LOOKING TO EXPAND THEIR OPERATIONS THEY FOUND THAT- THERE WELL THE WELL OF THE LAND THAT THEY HAD JUST PURCHASED WHICH IS ABOUT TEN ACRES. WAS ABOUT TEN FEET ABOVE THE WATER TABLE SO THE PUMP WASN'T REACHING THE GROUND WATER THAT THEY NEEDED TO START THIS OPERATION- THEY HAD ALREADY SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN PURCHASING LAND AS WELL AS OTHER COSTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH. YOU KNOW STARTING A SMALL SCALE FARM AND THEY WERE ALSO INTERESTED IN PURCHASING- EFFICIENT IRRIGATION SO THAT THEY CAN START. THEIR OPERATIONS EFFICIENTLY AND CONSERVING WATER AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BUT THE FUNDS JUST AREN'T PAYING OR THE MEANS FOR THEM TO FINANCIALLY AFFORD THESE TRANSITIONS. ARE IMPLEMENTATION OF TECHNOLOGY IS NOT THERE. ON THAT IS ALL I WILL SAY FOR NOW BUT I THINK FOUND. AS WE'RE FACED WITH THIS DROUGHT AND- EVEN WITH THE GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT ISSUE NETWORK BASED IN THE STATE. THERE IS A LOT- OF- NEED TO BE THERE FOR SMALL SCALE FARMERS IN TERMS OF MAKING INFORMATION ACCESSIBLE TO THEM IN MULTIPLE LANGUAGES SO THAT EVERYONE CAN MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER. AND ADDRESSES GROUNDWATER OVERDRAFT AND WATER MANAGEMENT TOGETHER. I THINK THAT MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF DROUGHT- IT WOULD BE BENEFICIALTO SPEAK WITH- ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE WORKING DIRECTLY WITH OUR FARMERS WITH OUR SMALL SCALE GROWERS. SO THAT THE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED. REFLECT THE NEEDS OF OUR GROWERS SO THAT WE CAN ADDRESS WATER MANAGEMENT AND MINDLESS MANAGEMENT IN THE ONE THAT. DOESN'T NEGATIVELY IMPACT THEM BUT EFFECTIVELY ADDRESSES. THEIR NEEDS FOR THE FUTURE THANK YOU END AND THEY CAN ASSIST AS APPRECIATE ALL THE INFORMATION AT THIS TIME ALL WILL TURN OVER TO MEMBERS. AND COLLEAGUES WITH ANY QUESTIONS. MISS AGUIAR-CURRY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND FOR SO I WANT TO THANK MY CONSTITUENTS FROM CAPE FEAR VALLEY. AND I CAN AGREE WITH THE MORE WE'VE SEEN THAT BEFORE VALLEY JUST GROW AND FLOURISH BUT- IT'S REALLY TAKEN AWAY FROM THE ABILITY TO GET FOUR MORE WATER. AND WITH A LACK OF WATER DOWN CACHE CREEK AND FROM LAKE COUNTY- IT'S BEEN A VERY TROUBLESOME FOR MANY OF US- BUT I DO WANT TO JUST MAKE A COMMENT- TO OUR YOUNG LADY FROM UC MERCED- I PUT TOGETHER SOME POLICY AND IS WORKING QUITE WELL THROUGH CDFA. THIS CALL THE DISADVANTAGED FAMILY PART OF FARMERS AND IS A PROGRAM THAT HELPS FARMERS IN DIFFERENT LANGUAGES PARTICULAR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE UNDERSTANDING AND HOW TO WORK THE SYSTEM BECAUSE AS WE KNOW IT'S NOT EASY TO BE A FARMER WE- DEMAND SO MUCH FROM THEM TO DO- ALL THE REGULATORY INFORMATION- YOU KNOW TRYING TO HELP FIND FUNDING SO I WOULD JUST RECOMMEND THAT THROUGH CDFA THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ONE WOMAN WHO IS. DOING AN INCREDIBLE JOB WORKING WITH OUR DISADVANTAGED FAMILY FARMER SOME OF THAT'S ONE THING. WITH HEALTHY SOILS- HALF OF SO MANY REAL GOOD THIS OF THE THINGS IS HARD TO MANEUVER THE SYSTEM AND UNDERSTAND THEM. SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT. WANTED TO SHARE THOSE THAT- BEEN A SMALL FAMILY FARMER LIKE I AM AND THE ONES WE'VE HEARD TODAY IT'S DIFFICULT. AND WE NEED TO NOT PUT SO MUCH- YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE A BIG CORPORATION YOU HAVE A LOT OF OTHER ASSETS. WHEN YOUR SMALL FAMILY FARM YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AND A FIX OF PUMP WE'VE HAD TWO PUMPS GO OUT THIS YEAR AND THEY WERE SO EXPENSIVE. AND TO FIND SOMEBODY TO COME REPAIR THEM AND REALLY DIRE TIME IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. AND THE COST OF THAT IS CAN JUST TURN YOUR WHOLE YEAR UPSIDE DOWN IN THE BLINK OF AN EYE SO- I FEEL YOUR PAIN I UNDERSTAND AND NOW WE HAVE A LOT MORE WORK TO DO AND I'M HOPING. WE HAVE SOME OUTCOMES FROM THESE MEETINGS WE'VE HAD HIM YEAR AFTER YEAR AND I DON'T FEEL LIKE WE HAVE A LOT OF OUTCOMES AND SO. IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO HELP OUR FARMERS ARE SMALL FAMILY FARMERS AND THE PEOPLE. AND I WANT TO FORGET THE PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED WITH THIS RIGHT WE HAVE FAMILIES AND SMALL COMMUNITIES OF. ALL OF US ARE AFFECTED BY THIS IN A RURAL AREA SO AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES TODAY AND- LET'S HOPEFULLY WE CAN GET SOMETHING OUT OF THIS TODAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHAT. YES SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU TO OUR CHAIRS AGAIN- AND THANK YOU TO OUR PANELISTS I JUST- YOU KNOW I'M SITTING HERE I'M REALLY STRUCK BY THE- THE STORIES AND THE PASSION FOR WHICH- OUR FARMERS ARE APPROACHING THEIR THEIR LIVELIHOOD AND WHAT IT MEANS WHAT IT MEANS TO THEM AND IT IS- IT IT'S HARD TO NOT FEEL LITTLE HEART BROKEN WHEN YOU SEE HOW DIFFICULT IT IS THIS YEAR AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THAT EVERYONE IS FACING. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE RECOGNIZE THOSE THAT ARE DOING- THE VERY BEST THEY CAN IN THE RIGHT THING- AND RECOGNIZE ALSO THAT- OFTEN IN THIS BUILDING WE DO A LOT OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL LEGISLATION THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY REFLECT THE NEEDS. AND THE CONCERNS OF SMALLER A SMALLER FARMERS ON THE MY DISTRICT- THE NORTH COAST WE DON'T HAVE A LOT OF THESE MASSIVE FARMS REALLY DOWN- WE HAVE A LOT OF SMALL FARMERS IT IS IT IS IT IS A FEELING MOSTLY SMALL FARMERS AS A BIGGER ENTITIES OF GROWING GRAPES BY THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GO THE LESS YOU SEE OF THAT. AND JUST YOU KNOW THINKING WE ALSO RELY ON RAIN WATER IN STORAGE- FOR WE DON'T THERE'S NO SNOW MELT- IN THE DISTRICT- THAT THAT SUPPLIES OF WATER FOR- FOR APPLES AND PEARS AND GRAPES AND LEAFY CROPS AND- AND FOR DAIRIES- AND SO IT IS IT IS DIFFERENT AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE AS A BODY RECOGNIZE THE DIFFERENCES IN REGIONS. THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THE CHALLENGES THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT THEY FACE AND WE APPROACH THAT- IN A IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T THAT ONE SIZE FITS ALL I THINK OF- THE HEALTHY SOILS PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE A MORE FOR PHARMA I'LL PUT A PLUG IN BECAUSE I I'M PUT THEIR NAME OUT THERE FORTUNATE FARMS. OVER IN MENDOCINO COUNTY- THEY SEQUESTER HUGE AMOUNTS OF CARBON IN THE SOIL- BASED ON THEIR FARMING PRACTICES. AND AND YOU KNOW HEARING FROM. OUR FOLKS FROM THE HUMANS FARM HOW DIFFICULT IT IS SOMETIMES YOU GET SOME OF THE FUNDING. THAT THAT THEY THEY BELIEVE THAT THEY ARE YOU KNOW IT SHOULD BE GETTING- BECAUSE IT TAKES A LONG TIME IS REALLY REALLY HEARTBREAKING ON ON TOP OF HEARTBREAK BECAUSE IT'S REALLY REALLY DIFFICULT. AND WE DO THAT IN A VARIETY OF AREAS AT THE STATE LEVEL SO- I JUST WANTED KNOWLEDGE THAT WE HEAR YOU- THAT- MS BERETTA AND WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM HER FATHER. AT A PREVIOUS HEARING OF THE BEEN TRAVEL WORK THEY'RE DOING- AND I DON'T WANT. I DON'T LIKE THE FACT THAT SOMETIMES WE CAST EVERYBODY IN THE SAME LIGHT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS DOING SOME GREAT WORK OUT THERE. WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE IT WE NEED TO INCENTIVIZE IT. AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT IT. AND THAT'S A I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT SHOULD BE THE FUTURE OF HOW WE APPROACH AGRICULTURE IN THE STATE. THANK YOU THANK YOU SEND THEM A REALLY APPRECIATE- THOSE COMMENTS AND I AS WELL WANT TO THANK THE PANEL FOR THEIR PARTICIPATION THEIR COMMENTS ALSO WANNA. ENCOURAGE MEMBERS TO LOOK AT THE POLICY BRIEF THAT WAS INCLUDED IN THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING PACKET FROM. YOU SEE A AND R. THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPACTS. OF THE PREVIOUS DROUGHT ON SMALL SCALE FARMERS AND ALSO. OFFERS POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO SUPPORT THEM AND HELP THEM- THIS DROUGHT AND SO THOSE ARE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS THAT I HOPE THAT- WE CAN LOOK AT- AND CONSIDER AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND SO WITH THAT. I'LL TURN IT BACK OVER TO CHAIR GARCIA- AS HE WILL LEAD US IN THIS- LAST PANEL. IT WAS RIDICULOUS REVERSAL GOING TO THE THIRD AND FINAL PANEL SOLUTIONS AND WHERE WE GO FROM HERE. IF TWO PRESENTERS- KAREN MICHEL. BALLS FARMING COMPANY RULES FROM OF MONGOLS DRAWFUL MELON AS LARA. PROFESSOR FROM UC MERCED THEY ARE WITH US. WILL NOT LASSEN TO- TO BEGIN. I GUESS- I THINK I'M GOING FIRST YEAR- THAT I WANT TO- FOR START BY- THINKING- THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR. AS WELL AS ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS- IT'S AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY- AND ALSO JUST TO BE ON THIS- PANEL- WITH THIS WHOLE GROUP OF DISTINGUISHED- PANELISTS- HOPE EVERYBODY CAN. HEAR ME OKAY IF- CAN'T CAN'T EXACTLY TELL WITH THE IDEAS LOOKING WE CAN TELL YOU THAT- OKAY PERFECT THANK YOU- QUICK DISCLAIMER I DO LOOK LIKE I'M SORT OF KICKED BACK AND I HAVE TO BE- OF BEHEADED. ANKLE SURGERIES IN MY ANKLE SB ELEVATED SO I LOOK A LITTLE MORE RELAXED THEN MAYBE I SHOULD LOOK- AT THIS. AUSPICIOUS OCCASION HERE BUT- ANYWAY I DID WANT TO START- YOU KNOW AGAIN EVERYBODY'S WE HAVE A I HAVE A LONG DAY AND WE GOT A LOT TO COVER IN TERMS OF SOLUTIONS- AGAIN MY NAME IS ZACH IS CANON MICHAEL. I AM THE- THE PRESIDENT OF MY FAMILY'S FARMING COMPANY ON THE SIXTH GENERATION OF THE FAMILY TO BE INVOLVED WITH THE BUSINESS- WE'VE BEEN FARMING THE SAME LAND HERE- OUTSIDE OF LOS FINE YES- FOR THE- THE PAST HUNDRED SIXTY YEARS- PLUS- WE GROW- TWENTY DIFFERENT CROPS- BOTH WITH ORGANIC AND CONVENTIONAL METHODS. ARE PRIMARILY- ANNUAL VEGETABLE CROPS- I AM ALSO INVOLVED ACTIVELY IN WATER ISSUES SERVE ON OUR LOCAL WATER DISTRICT AND I'M ALSO THE CHAIRMAN OF THE- ST LOUIS AND ULTIMATE ON A WATER AUTHORITY- WHICH- HAS- TWENTY NINE- MEMBERS- COVERING BOTH THE- OR COVERING ALL. SECTORS ENVIRONMENT- WITH THE GRASSLANDS BY WILDLIFE MANAGEMENT AREA. COVERING AGRICULTURE LARGE AND SMALL AND ALSO- COVERING URBAN WATER USE- VALLEY WATER AND SAN BENITO. SO BEEN- INTERESTED IN WORKING WITH A DIFFERENT SECTORS AND- WANTED TO START JUST JUST VERY QUICKLY WITH A QUICK STORY- BECAUSE IT'S- L. ILLUSTRATIVE IN MY MIND- I'VE BEEN ON THE- TWITTER AND I POSTED A MAP THE OTHER DAY AND WE DO A LOT OF MAPS. HERE ON THE FARM AND WE USE SPATIAL DATA SO I OF MY BIG FAN OF MAPS TELL STORIES IN AND LOOK AT THINGS AND OPPOSED A MAP OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES DIVISION OF FLOOD MANAGEMENT DOES A SACRAMENTO SAN JOAQUIN RIVER SYSTEMS- SCHEMATIC. AND IT ENDS UP LOOKING A LITTLE BIT LIKE A SUBWAY SYSTEM- IT SHOWS ALL THE DIFFERENT- BOXES FOR THE DIFFERENT RESERVOIRS AND THEIR CAPACITIES AND THEN- JUST- THE LIVE RIVERS END UP LOOKING LIKE A TRANSIT LINES- AND SO THE- REACTIONS WERE. A LOT OF PEOPLE WERE INTERESTED IN AND- I THOUGHT IT WAS- YOU KNOW. ABOUT MAYBE SOME HADN'T SEEN. AND I DID SEE ONE- AND NGO THE- FRIEND THAT I KNOW THAT POSTED YOU KNOW. HERE'S A LOOK AT- YOU KNOW KIND OF THE OVER ENGINEERING AND THE TERRIBLE THE OVER THE YEARS YOU KNOW TO THE RIVER SYSTEMS. AND I JUST THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT PLACE FOR ME ONE WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS AND THINKING ABOUT WHERE TO START I THINK WE DO NEED TO. KIND OF BE ABLE TO HAVE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS AND BE ABLE TO LOOK AT- AT SITUATIONS IN AN OBJECTIVE. OBJECTIVE WAY- YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF US CAN REACH FOR THE TAPPER OR THE VAST MAJORITY CALIFORNIANS CAN REACH FOR THE TOP MATTER WHERE THEY ARE. IN THE- KIND OF UNDERSTAND THAT- YOU KNOW. WHAT'S GOING TO COME OUT AND THEY RELY ON THAT AND- YOU KNOW THEY THEY TRUST THAT AND- YOU KNOW THAT. IN A LOT OF A- LOT OF PLACES- OBVIOUSLY THE MARKETS ARE ALSO FULL OF FOOD AND SO WE DON'T WE DON'T WORRY ABOUT ABOUT THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND I THINK ALSO. PEOPLE LIVE IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS AND WHEN IT'S RAINING THEY DON'T FEAR THE- FEAR THE FLOODS- ANYMORE AND THINK A LOT OF THAT'S BECAUSE WE DO HAVE AN ENGINEERED SYSTEM- AND I THINK. YOU KNOW. MAYBE WASN'T MAYBE SOME OF THE DECISIONS THAT WERE MADE. AND HOW THINGS WERE WERE PUT TOGETHER- YOU KNOW DIDN'T. ACCOUNT FOR. YOU KNOW EVERYTHING OR OR YOU KNW THERE'S- THERE'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN SOME ISSUES WITH HAVING A HIGHLY ENGINEERED SYSTEM BUT I THINK AT LEAST WE NEED TO START WITH. THE RECOGNITION THAT SYSTEM GIVES US THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE HAVE- YOU KNOW CANNOT BE MANAGED BETTER CAN. WE DO DIFFERENT THINGS YOU KNOW. WE OF THE CAN BUT I WE ALSO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SOME INVESTMENTS THE SYSTEM AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SOLUTIONS. THERE HAVE TO BE SOME INVESTMENTS AND- TO BE HONEST I JUST FEEL LIKE WE REALLY LAGGED BEHIND- WE HAD POPULATION GROWTH AND WE'VE HAD YOU KNOW. MASSIVE CHANGE IN OUR STATE BUT NOT NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF. CHANGING OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE- AND YOU KNOW I THINK CALIFORNIA'S VERY PROGRESSIVE STATE YOU KNOW WE LEAD ON- CLIMATE CHANGE WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE LEGISLATURE WE READ ON. YOU KNOW WANTING TO BE THE FRONT RUNNERS IN- IN INFRASTRUCTURE FOR. TRANSPORTATION FOR MODERN TRANSPORTATION- I DRIVE BACK AND FORTH FROM FRESNO TO LOS BANOS QUITE A BIT AND- SEE THE LARGEST CEMENT STRUCTURE GOING ON ACROSS THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER THERE TO. TO SUPPORT- YOU KNOW HIGH SPEED RAIL PROJECT- AND I THINK THAT'S GREAT YOU KNOW IF WE CAN WE CAN HAVE A PUBLIC THAT'S WILLING TO SAY WILL VOTE FOR. A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS- TO SUPPORT THAT KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE AYE I THINK THE ONLY THING I HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THIS. WHEN WE HAVE YOU KNOW A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR- WATER PROJECT THERE ARE YOU KNOW THEY'RE LOOKED AT AS BEING TOO EXPENSIVE. EVEN WHEN THEY DO HAVE. DIRECT AND DEMONSTRABLE BENEFITS FOR. THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR COMMUNITIES AND FOR AGRICULTURE- YOU KNOW THEY'RE STILL JUST LIKE THAT IS THAT'S TOO MUCH BUT- YOU KNOW AGAIN. WE DO HAVE THE WILL POWER TO- PUT MONEY TOWARDS VERY LARGE PROJECTS AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE TIME HAS COME TO WHERE YOU. NEED TO PUT SOME OF THAT MONEY TOWARDS OUR- WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. BECAUSE- WE ARE LAGGING BEHIND WHEN I THINK WHILE EVERYTHING IS ON THE TABLE- YOU KNOW WE NEED GROUNDWATER RECHARGE. WE NEED- WATER MARKETS AND FLEXIBILITY AND ALL THOSE KIND OF THINGS. YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY THERE ARE GOING TO NEED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER EARLIER REFERENCED YOU KNOW THE NEED FOR SOME ADDITIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE NINE AND I FEEL LIKE THAT THAT'S TRUE THEIR SMALL STREAM. PROJECTS THAT NEED TO GET BUILT. THERE SOME CAN BAN SAID NEEDS- CAPACITY NEEDS TO BE RESTORED- YOU KNOW WE CAN'T HAVE AN ACTIVE WATER MARKET IF YOU CAN'T TRANSMIT THE PRODUCT. AND WE CAN'T GET- GROUNDWATER RECHARGE TO WORK EFFECTIVELY YOU CAN'T MOVE THE WATER INTO THE AREAS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE RECHARGE. AND THEN ALSO EXTRACT THAT WATER AT THE SAME TIME AND MOVE IT TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED AND IN TIMES OF SCARCITY. SO AGAIN I THINK WE NEED TO. WE NEED TO STEP BACK WE NEED TO LOOK AT THAT THAT THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE DO HAVE TODAY- I THINK WE NEED TO VALUE ALL THE DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS I'M I'M A- I'M A CALIFORNIA FARMER BUT- I AM- FIRMLY EIGHT. A CALIFORNIANS FIRST AND BELIEVE THAT. I CALIFORNIA'S A WONDERFUL STATE THAT IT IS BECAUSE THE COMMUNITIES THAT WE HAVE BOTH- YOU KNOW LARGE AND SMALL AND IN BETWEEN. IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE BECAUSE THE ENVIRONMENT THAT WE HAVE. AND IT'S A WONDERFUL PLACE BECAUSE OF HAVING AGRICULTURE THAT WE DO HAVE. AND HAVING AGRICULTURE THAT OPERATES IN A HIGHLY REGULATED ENVIRONMENT AND THAT DOES CARE FOR WORKERS AND WORKER PROTECTION AND- DOES CARE FOR ENVIRONMENT ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION WITH- YOU KNOW ENFORCEABLE PENALTIES IF WE MAKE A- MAKE A MISTAKE. AND I ALSO THINK IT'S A MISTAKE- IN SOME WAYS I DO THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE AGRICULTURE CHANGE WITH CIGNA. AND I AND I DO AGREE THAT SIGNAL WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS NECESSARY. I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO BE HONEST AND IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS I THINK WE HEARD- WE'VE HEARD FROM A BUNCH OF FAMILY FARMERS TODAY- WE'VE HEARD SOME. ALLUSIONS TO OTHERS THAT HAVE COME IN AND MAKE YOU JUST SEE- CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA FARMLAND AS AS AND NUMBER ON A SPREADSHEET SOMEWHERE WITH THE- RETURN PERCENTAGE ATTACHED TO IT AND- YOU KNOW. I RAISE MY KIDS HERE ON THE FARM. WE SUPPORTED OUR COMMUNITY WE DONATE TO OUR HOSPITAL TO OUR SCHOOLS- YOU KNOW WE WALK THE SAME DEALS WITH OUR WORKERS WE- YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE DAY IN AND DAY OUT AND THERE'S GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE VAST TRACTS OF LAND THAT DON'T HAVE THAT SAME CONNECTION TO OUR LANDS. AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO BE HONEST ABOUT TALK ABOUT THAT. YOU KNOW AGRICULTURE IS GOING TO CHANGE SEGMENT IS GOING TO CHANGE. YOUR LIKE THIS YOU DO SEE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE. A CONTRACTION BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVEN THOUGH WE'RE IN THIS TIME OF SCARCITY AND- YOU KNOW IF YOU LOOK AT THE PAST DECADE IT'S BEEN MORE DROUGHT YEARS THAN THAN WHAT YEARS BUT- I DON'T WANT TO TAKE OUR EYE OFF THE FACT THAT. MAYBE WE. CAN DO BETTER AND MAYBE WITH MORE MORE COLLABO AND UNIT WITH EACH OTHER MAYBE- PUTTING DOWN THE- PUTTING DOWN SOME OF THE OLD FIGHTS AND GRUDGES MAYBE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER ON BETTER SOLUTIONS ARE SOME GREAT PROGRAMS GOING ON TO SUPPORT. THE SHELF IN THE SACRAMENTO VALLEY. I KNOW WE'RE LOOKING AT PROJECTS HERE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY TO. RESTORE THE SAN JOAQUIN RIVER INTO MAKE- IMPROVEMENTS HERE- I DON'T WANT TO LOSE SIGHT OF THAT. YOU KNOW. MAYBE IT MAYBE. MAYBE WE CAN DO BETTER MAYBE YOU KNOW THERE THERE ARE GOING TO BE WHAT YEARS AGAIN THAT THERE ARE GONNA BE. WAYS TO WORK TOGETHER TO BABY RESTORE FISH POPULATIONS BETTER THAN JUST SUING EACH OTHER. MAYBE THE SOLUTIONS LAY OUT ON THE GROUND AND BY WORKING. TOGETHER WE GOT INTELLIGENT PEOPLE WE'VE GOT. MOTIVATED PEOPLE. AND THEY WOULD BE A LOT BETTER OFF PUTTING OUR ENERGY TOWARDS- MAKING SOME REAL PROGRESS IN TERMS OF DOING SOME PROJECTS TOGETHER VERSUS JUST FIGHTING EACH OTHER. AND JUST NOT THINK THAT WE JUST HAVE TO GIVE UP. YOU KNOW SO MUCH FARMLAND OR GIVE UP SO MUCH- YOU HAVE SPECIES TO GO EXTINCT I DON'T THINK THOSE ARE THE- KIND OF CONVERSATIONS I REALLY WANT TO BE. A PART OF YOU KNOW I DO LIKE I SAID EARLIER I THINK SIGNAL IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF SOME OF THE UNSUSTAINABLE THINGS. THAT HAVE BEEN HAPPENING SO I'M FAIRLY CONFIDENT IN IN THERE'S GOING-TO BE SOME CHANGE THERE BUT- I THINK EVERY LOSS OF A CALIFORNIA FAMILY FARM. IS A HUGE LOSS FOR- NOT JUST CALIFORNIA BEFORE THE NATION- I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND NOT JUST TALK ABOUT FOOD SECURITY BUT NUTRITION SECURITY BECAUSE THE KIND OF- THINGS WE PRODUCE HERE IN CALIFORNIA WHAT PEOPLE SHOULD BE EATING- YOU KNOW YOU CAN HAVE A LOT OF WHEAT OR CORN OR THOSE KIND OF THINGS AND- THAT MIGHT BE CALLED FOOD SECURITY BUT- YOU KNOW HAVING. FRESH VEGETABLES AND- YOU KNOW. THIRDS THAT GIVES YOU KNOW NATURAL PROTEIN AND ALL THOSE KINDS OF THINGS ARE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE AND- ALSO IS A HEALTHCARE ISSUE IN A COSTUME. AND ALL THOSE THINGS SO. ANYWAY YOU KNOW THERE'S A MOTHER BASIC SOLUTIONS I THINK YOU KNOW THE WAY IT GRAVERT TALKS A LOT ABOUT- YOU KNOW CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE. AND GETTING PROJECTS- STREAMLINED AND- YOU KNOW WORKING THAT YOU KNOW AGAIN MAKING THAT COLLABORATION EASIER I THINK THOSE ARE REALLY. IMPORTANT THINGS TO DO BUT- AGAIN I JUST- APPRECIATE THE TIME AND THINK THAT WE DO POSITIVE PEOPLE WHO CAN WORK TOGETHER AND- WE NEED TO EMPOWER THEM AND POWER BETTER WORKING RELATIONSHIPS AND- WORK WITH THE- WITH THE LEADERSHIP TO. TO KIND OF. GUIDE US THROUGH. SOME OF THESE ISSUES AND I THINK WE- ALL HAVE A VESTED INTEREST IN MAKING CALIFORNIA THE BEST IT CAN BE FOR. FUTURE GENERATIONS AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THE CHARGE THAT I HAVE BEEN. THE WAY THAT I'M TRYING TO WORK SO AGAIN THANK YOU ALL FOR THE TIME I APPRECIATE IT I KNOW IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERYMUCH AND- WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU FOR. POTENTIAL QUESTIONS WE HAVE ONE MORE PRESENTER IT'S- A PROFESSOR MEDINA AS LARA FROM UC MERCED THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION I. REALLY HONORED TO SPEAK TO YOU- I WOULD JUST GIVE YOU SOME MAFIA NUMBERS ON ON THE OUTING CALIFORNIA AND SOMETIMES- I'M KIND OF IN THIS RELATIONS FINAL BUT I FEEL REALLY HUMBLED BY ALL THE TESTIMONY UPON MY FELLOW- FINALLY SWITCH CAB. A PROVIDE A GREAT CLOSER OF FIRST ON ON THAT OUT AND HOW IT AFFECTS US- OR- SO- SO IN IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MEDIAN EXISTING FARMS ABOUT.
