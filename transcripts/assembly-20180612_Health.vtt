00:29:16.388 --> 00:29:19.524 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:29:18.223 --> 00:29:21.293 region:rollup2
THE FIRST DISABILITY DID NOT

00:29:19.524 --> 00:29:23.295 region:rollup2
EVEN OFFER ABORTIONS.

00:29:21.293 --> 00:29:24.963 region:rollup2
THE SECOND ONE DIDN'T.

00:29:23.295 --> 00:29:26.331 region:rollup2
WITH ABLE TO SCHEDULE ME BUT

00:29:24.963 --> 00:29:28.433 region:rollup2
NOT UNTIL NOVEMBER.

00:29:26.331 --> 00:29:29.901 region:rollup2
IF THAT WEREN'T ENOUGH.

00:29:28.433 --> 00:29:31.370 region:rollup2
TWO WEEKS BEFORE MY APPOINTMENT

00:29:29.901 --> 00:29:32.771 region:rollup2
THE SECOND FACILITY DENIED MY

00:29:31.370 --> 00:29:34.172 region:rollup2
INSURANCE CLEANING THAT I DID

00:29:32.771 --> 00:29:36.208 region:rollup2
NOT HAVE THE UC STUDENT HEALTH

00:29:34.172 --> 00:29:37.609 region:rollup2
INSURANCE PLAN.

00:29:36.208 --> 00:29:39.444 region:rollup2
FEELING EXTREMELY DISCOURAGED TO

00:29:37.609 --> 00:29:42.147 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE ORDEAL SENT ME ON A

00:29:39.444 --> 00:29:44.116 region:rollup2
DOWNWARD SPIRAL. I DO GO OUT AND

00:29:42.147 --> 00:29:45.717 region:rollup2
MY GRADES SLIPPED DRAMATICALLY.

00:29:44.116 --> 00:29:47.219 region:rollup2
AND EVERYDAY WAS EXHAUSTING.

00:29:45.717 --> 00:29:48.820 region:rollup2
MOST OF MY DAYS ARE SPENT

00:29:47.219 --> 00:29:50.722 region:rollup2
NAPPING BECAUSE I WAS EXHAUSTED

00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.958 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE I WANTED TO ESCAPE

00:29:50.722 --> 00:29:54.426 region:rollup2
THE REALITY OF MY SITUATION.

00:29:52.958 --> 00:29:55.727 region:rollup2
NOT KNOWING WHAT TO DO I THEN

00:29:54.426 --> 00:29:57.295 region:rollup2
AGAIN CALLED MY STUDENT HEALTH

00:29:55.727 --> 00:29:58.897 region:rollup2

OPTIONS.

00:29:58.897 --> 00:30:01.733 region:rollup2
IT WAS THEN THAT THEY CLARIFIED

00:30:00.632 --> 00:30:03.535 region:rollup2
THAT I WAS NOT LIMITED TO MY

00:30:01.733 --> 00:30:05.370 region:rollup2
REFERRALS.

00:30:03.535 --> 00:30:06.805 region:rollup2
SO FINALLY I WAS ABLE TO

HOW IT'S PROVIDED A FEW

00:32:45.697 --> 00:32:48.333 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS?

00:32:47.165 --> 00:32:49.868 region:rollup2
I'M THE FIRST IT HAD LIKE TO

00:32:48.333 --> 00:32:50.468 region:rollup2
DISCUSS WAS LED BY MY COLLEAGUE

00:32:49.868 --> 00:32:52.204 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WHO SMOKED POT BE AYE

00:32:50.468 --> 00:32:54.172 region:rollup2
FROM ANSWER AND AIM TO QUANTIFY

00:32:52.204 --> 00:32:56.708 region:rollup2
ACCESS TO ABORTION FOR YOU SEE

00:32:54.172 --> 00:32:57.509 region:rollup2
AND CSU STUDENTS. AND AND ASSESS

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.578 region:rollup2
HOW FAR A.

00:32:57.509 --> 00:33:00.645 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO TRAVEL TO ACCESS

00:32:59.578 --> 00:33:02.147 region:rollup2
ABORTION CARE.

00:33:00.645 --> 00:33:02.881 region:rollup2
BRIEFLY THE RESEARCHERS ESTIMATE

00:33:02.147 --> 00:33:04.349 region:rollup2
THAT BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED

00:33:02.881 --> 00:33:06.818 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO AND FIVE HUNDRED

00:33:04.349 --> 00:33:08.253 region:rollup2

OBTAIN A MEDICATION ABORTION

00:33:08.253 --> 00:33:11.156 region:rollup2
EACH MONTH. WHICH WORKS OUT TO

00:33:10.222 --> 00:33:12.724 region:rollup2
BE ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN

00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:14.392 region:rollup2
MEDICATION ABORTIONS PER CAMPUS

00:33:12.724 --> 00:33:15.994 region:rollup2
PER MONTH AT THIS NUMBER OF

00:33:14.392 --> 00:33:17.329 region:rollup2
CASES IS SIMILAR TO WHAT OTHER

00:33:15.994 --> 00:33:18.196 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEDICINE PROVIDERS REPORT

00:33:17.329 --> 00:33:19.264 region:rollup2
IN THEIR CLINICS AND IT'S

00:33:18.196 --> 00:33:20.232 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY A SUFFICIENT NUMBER

00:33:19.264 --> 00:33:21.733 region:rollup2
FOR CLINICIANS TO MAINTAIN THEIR

00:33:20.232 --> 00:33:22.968 region:rollup2
SKILLS.

00:33:21.733 --> 00:33:24.035 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THE DISTANCE TO THE

NEAREST PROVIDER THE RESEARCHERS

00:33:24.035 --> 00:33:26.638 region:rollup2
FOUND THAT ACROSS ALL CAMPUSES

00:33:25.904 --> 00:33:27.939 region:rollup2
THE MEDIAN TIME IN PUBLIC

00:33:26.638 --> 00:33:29.507 region:rollup2

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:31.610 region:rollup2
PROVIDER THAT I'D STUDENT WOULD

00:33:29.507 --> 00:33:32.978 region:rollup2
NEED AND TAKE TO GET TOWARD A

CLINIC IS ABOUT THIRTY FOUR

00:33:32.978 --> 00:33:36.448 region:rollup2
MINUTES EACH WAY GIVEN THE TWO

00:33:34.679 --> 00:33:38.283 region:rollup2
VISITS THAT WORKS OUT TO BE TWO

00:33:36.448 --> 00:33:39.384 region:rollup2
HOURS ON PUBLIC TRANSPORT.

00:33:38.283 --> 00:33:41.052 region:rollup2
THE SECOND STUDY.

00:33:39.384 --> 00:33:43.288 region:rollup2
WE AIM TO COLLECT INFORMATION

00:33:41.052 --> 00:33:44.256 region:rollup2
FROM ALL THE UC AND CSU CAMPUSES

00:33:43.288 --> 00:33:45.624 region:rollup2
AND TO SEE IF THEY HAVE THE

00:33:44.256 --> 00:33:47.626 region:rollup2
CAPACITY TO PROVIDE MEDICATION

00:33:45.624 --> 00:33:48.927 region:rollup2
PORTION ON CAMPUS. AND WHAT THEY

00:33:47.626 --> 00:33:49.794 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

00:33:48.927 --> 00:33:50.996 region:rollup2
I DON'T HAVE TIME TO GO THROUGH

00:33:49.794 --> 00:33:52.731 region:rollup2
THAT THAT'S ALL COVERED IN MY

00:33:50.996 --> 00:33:54.165 region:rollup2
REPORT BUT JUST TO SAY. THAT WE

00:33:52.731 --> 00:33:54.1000 region:rollup2
DID FIND.

00:33:54.165 --> 00:33:57.402 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:33:54.1000 --> 00:33:59.237 region:rollup2
THAT THIS THE SITES HAVE THE

00:33:57.402 --> 00:34:00.138 region:rollup2
RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED AND

00:33:59.237 --> 00:34:01.540 region:rollup2
WITH A MODERATE AMOUNT OF

00:34:00.138 --> 00:34:02.107 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT SIMILAR TO THE

00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:03.475 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT THAT HAS ALREADY

00:34:02.107 --> 00:34:05.010 region:rollup2

OFFER MEDICATION ABORTION THEY

00:34:10.148 --> 00:34:12.684 region:rollup2
WOULD NEED I'M INVEST IN TERMS

THIRTEEN I DISCOVERED I WAS

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:16.134 region:rollup2
PREGNANT WITH MY SECOND CHILD.

00:42:14.732 --> 00:42:17.201 region:rollup2
I WILL NEVER FORGET THE DAY I

00:42:16.134 --> 00:42:19.003 region:rollup2
SAW AT THE GROCERY STORE

00:42:17.201 --> 00:42:20.872 region:rollup2

00:42:19.003 --> 00:42:23.174 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY ALONE STARING AT THAT

00:42:20.872 --> 00:42:25.343 region:rollup2
SECOND POSITIVE PREGNANCY TO.

00:42:23.174 --> 00:42:26.511 region:rollup2
I WAS NINETEEN YEARS OLD.

I HAD JUST LEFT.

00:42:31.716 --> 00:42:34.552 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY AND VERBALLY ABUSIVE

00:42:33.117 --> 00:42:36.821 region:rollup2
RELATIONSHIP I HAD BEEN ALL OF

00:42:34.552 --> 00:42:37.422 region:rollup2
MY TEENAGE YEARS.

00:42:36.821 --> 00:42:39.190 region:rollup2
AND I THOUGHT THAT RAISING TWO

00:42:37.422 --> 00:42:40.758 region:rollup2
CHILDREN AND EIGHTEEN YEARS OLD

00:42:39.190 --> 00:42:42.894 region:rollup2
WHILE IN SCHOOL WOULD BE

00:42:40.758 --> 00:42:45.029 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY IMPOSSIBLE.

00:42:42.894 --> 00:42:46.731 region:rollup2
SO I SOUGHT A SOLUTION I SOUGHT

00:42:45.029 --> 00:42:48.066 region:rollup2
OUT A LOCATION.

00:42:46.731 --> 00:42:49.700 region:rollup2
I QUICKLY LEARNED THAT THERE

00:42:48.066 --> 00:42:51.269 region:rollup2
WERE EIGHT ABORTION FACILITIES

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.437 region:rollup2

00:42:51.269 --> 00:42:54.439 region:rollup2

MILE RADIUS CLEARLY

00:42:54.439 --> 00:42:57.608 region:rollup2
ACCESSIBILITY WAS NOT AN ISSUE.

00:42:56.007 --> 00:42:59.343 region:rollup2
HOW WITH REALLY NO HOPE IN SIGHT

00:42:57.608 --> 00:43:00.478 region:rollup2
AND FEELING ALONE SCARED

00:42:59.343 --> 00:43:02.046 region:rollup2
DESPERATE AND HOPELESS AB YET

00:43:00.478 --> 00:43:03.281 region:rollup2

00:43:02.046 --> 00:43:04.515 region:rollup2
THIRTEENTH OF TWO THOUSAND

00:43:03.281 --> 00:43:05.817 region:rollup2
THIRTEEN?

00:43:04.515 --> 00:43:07.518 region:rollup2
IT IS A DAY THAT I WILL NEVER

00:43:05.817 --> 00:43:08.486 region:rollup2
FORGET.

00:43:07.518 --> 00:43:09.587 region:rollup2

00:43:23.801 --> 00:43:25.636 region:rollup2
SWALLOWED THE PILL IN FRONT OF

00:43:24.402 --> 00:43:27.004 region:rollup2
HER.

00:43:25.636 --> 00:43:27.572 region:rollup2
IT WAS SENT ON MY WAY BUT IT WAS

00:43:27.004 --> 00:43:28.773 region:rollup2
NOT PREPARED FOR WHAT WAS TO

00:43:27.572 --> 00:43:30.541 region:rollup2
COME NEXT.

00:43:28.773 --> 00:43:32.276 region:rollup2
BY THE TIME I GOT TO MY CAR WITH

00:43:30.541 --> 00:43:34.645 region:rollup2
MY BROWN PAPER BAG FULL OF

00:43:32.276 --> 00:43:36.013 region:rollup2

00:43:34.645 --> 00:43:37.615 region:rollup2
I COULD NOT BELIEVE WHAT JUST

00:43:36.013 --> 00:43:40.284 region:rollup2
HAPPENED AND I BEGAN TO FEEL

00:43:37.615 --> 00:43:41.752 region:rollup2
INTENSE SADNESS AND REGRET.

00:43:40.284 --> 00:43:43.221 region:rollup2
CRISIS IN FEAR HAD FOUGHT MY

00:43:41.752 --> 00:43:44.555 region:rollup2
MIND FOR THE WEEKS LEADING UP TO

00:43:43.221 --> 00:43:46.157 region:rollup2
THIS DECISION BUT I COULD NOW

00:43:44.555 --> 00:43:48.292 region:rollup2
SEE CLEARLY THE EXTENT OF MY

00:43:46.157 --> 00:43:49.694 region:rollup2
ACTIONS. AND I WANTED SO BADLY

00:43:48.292 --> 00:43:51.596 region:rollup2
TO TAKE BACK THE LAST TEN

00:43:49.694 --> 00:43:52.930 region:rollup2
MINUTES OF MY LIFE.

00:43:51.596 --> 00:43:54.432 region:rollup2

INSTEAD OF TAKING ME SO PROCESS

00:43:57.235 --> 00:44:00.071 region:rollup2
ALL.

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:01.038 region:rollup2
THE FOLLOWING DAY A DRUG THAT IS

00:44:00.071 --> 00:44:02.707 region:rollup2

00:44:05.276 --> 00:44:08.913 region:rollup2
I CHANGE MY MIND AND UNDERWENT.

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:09.981 region:rollup2

00:44:09.981 --> 00:44:12.550 region:rollup2

01:26:40.095 --> 01:26:43.865 region:rollup2
BUT I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS.

01:26:41.697 --> 01:26:45.667 region:rollup2
FOR.

01:26:43.865 --> 01:26:47.636 region:rollup2
EITHER SIDE WHO WERE WITNESSES

01:26:45.667 --> 01:26:49.905 region:rollup2
OR ANYONE WHO CAN ANSWER.

01:26:47.636 --> 01:26:51.073 region:rollup2
.

01:26:49.905 --> 01:26:52.708 region:rollup2
JUST BECAUSE I READ THE BILL SO

01:26:51.073 --> 01:26:55.210 region:rollup2
WASN'T SURE.

01:26:52.708 --> 01:26:55.610 region:rollup2
IT DIDN'T EXPLICITLY SAY IN THE

01:26:55.210 --> 01:26:58.113 region:rollup2
BILL SOME OF THIS.

01:26:55.610 --> 01:26:59.581 region:rollup2
.

01:26:58.113 --> 01:27:01.616 region:rollup2
PART OF IT IS EMPLOYEES WHO ARE

01:26:59.581 --> 01:27:04.019 region:rollup2
WORKING IN IN THESE HEALTH

01:27:01.616 --> 01:27:05.253 region:rollup2
CLINICS IN THOSE THINGS SCHOOLS.

01:27:04.019 --> 01:27:07.889 region:rollup2
WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM IF THEY

01:27:05.253 --> 01:27:09.091 region:rollup2
REFUSE TO PARTICIPATE BECAUSE OF

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:10.859 region:rollup2
THEIR CONSCIENCE AS THERE A

01:27:09.091 --> 01:27:14.396 region:rollup2
EXCLUSION?

01:27:10.859 --> 01:27:15.163 region:rollup2
FOR CONSCIENCE OBJECTION.

01:27:14.396 --> 01:27:16.098 region:rollup2
DID THE FOLKS WHO WORK IN THE

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:20.902 region:rollup2
HEALTH CARE CENTER DON'T HAVE TO

01:27:16.098 --> 01:27:22.704 region:rollup2
WORK IF THEY DON'T WANT TO.

01:27:20.902 --> 01:27:24.372 region:rollup2
WELL THEN THAT THE ANSWER IS IF

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:25.373 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T WANT TO ADMINISTER IT

01:27:24.372 --> 01:27:26.875 region:rollup2
THEY WOULD NOT BE HIRED TO

01:27:25.373 --> 01:27:29.444 region:rollup2
ADMINISTER A BECAUSE HOUSE BE

01:27:26.875 --> 01:27:31.446 region:rollup2
ADMINISTERED BY AN RN.

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:32.748 region:rollup2
OKAY.

01:27:31.446 --> 01:27:33.915 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THEY HAVE TO HAVE

01:27:32.748 --> 01:27:35.383 region:rollup2
TRAINING IN THERE'S NO THERE'S A

01:27:33.915 --> 01:27:37.219 region:rollup2
WHOLE SERIES OF FOLKS THAT CAN

01:27:35.383 --> 01:27:37.452 region:rollup2
GET THAT TRAINING.

01:27:37.219 --> 01:27:39.287 region:rollup2
SO OKAY.

01:27:37.452 --> 01:27:40.956 region:rollup2
.

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:42.924 region:rollup2
AND THE OTHER THING WAS.

01:27:40.956 --> 01:27:44.993 region:rollup2
REGARDING LIABILITY.

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:46.695 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WAS BROUGHT UP. IN

01:27:44.993 --> 01:27:49.164 region:rollup2
THE OPPOSITION TESTIMONY.

01:27:46.695 --> 01:27:51.533 region:rollup2
WHAT IF SOME OF THE SIDE EFFECTS

01:27:49.164 --> 01:27:53.235 region:rollup2
HAPPEN IN THERE IS AN INJURY?

01:27:51.533 --> 01:27:54.803 region:rollup2
IS THE SCHOOL LIABLE OR DOES THE

01:27:53.235 --> 01:27:56.972 region:rollup2
BILL CONTAINS.

01:27:54.803 --> 01:27:59.074 region:rollup2
AN EXEMPTION NORA.

01:27:56.972 --> 01:28:00.509 region:rollup2
BUT THE SCHOOL IS NO MORE LIABLE

01:27:59.074 --> 01:28:02.310 region:rollup2
FOR THIS PROCEDURE THAN THEY ARE

01:28:00.509 --> 01:28:03.578 region:rollup2
FOR ANY OTHER PROCEDUREAT THAT

01:28:02.310 --> 01:28:06.681 region:rollup2
A STUDENT MIGHT OBTAIN AT THE

01:28:03.578 --> 01:28:09.417 region:rollup2
HEALTH CENTER.

01:28:06.681 --> 01:28:11.119 region:rollup2
.

01:28:09.417 --> 01:28:12.654 region:rollup2
SO WOULD THAT DOES AND I WOULD

01:28:11.119 --> 01:28:13.889 region:rollup2
ASSUME THEN THE SAME THING WILL

01:28:12.654 --> 01:28:15.490 region:rollup2
GO FOR THE HEALTH CENTERS THAT

01:28:13.889 --> 01:28:16.191 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE.

01:28:15.490 --> 01:28:18.026 region:rollup2
A.

01:28:16.191 --> 01:28:19.594 region:rollup2
TRANSFER AGREEMENT WITH A LOCAL

01:28:18.026 --> 01:28:21.163 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL

01:28:19.594 --> 01:28:23.598 region:rollup2
FOR ANY OF THAT THESE

01:28:21.163 --> 01:28:24.633 region:rollup2
COMPLICATIONS ARE ANY OTHER. I

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.801 region:rollup2
JUST I MASSIVE ASCENDANCY IN THE

01:28:24.633 --> 01:28:28.003 region:rollup2

DR GROSSMAN.

01:28:28.003 --> 01:28:30.672 region:rollup2
AND JUST TO SAY THAT THERE IS NO

01:28:29.604 --> 01:28:31.540 region:rollup2
MEDICAL REASON WHY THEY WOULD

01:28:30.672 --> 01:28:32.807 region:rollup2
HAVE TO HAVE A TRANSFER

01:28:31.540 --> 01:28:34.042 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT LIKE A WRITTEN

01:28:32.807 --> 01:28:35.377 region:rollup2

IN MEDICINE SAID SUCH

01:28:37.879 --> 01:28:41.216 region:rollup2
WRITTEN AGREEMENTS ARE NOT

01:28:39.848 --> 01:28:43.251 region:rollup2
MEDICALLY NECESSARY IT IS

01:28:41.216 --> 01:28:44.953 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO KNOW WHERE TO SEND.

01:28:43.251 --> 01:28:46.221 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WHO HAVE A RARE

01:28:44.953 --> 01:28:47.322 region:rollup2
COMPLICATION SO THEY CAN GET

01:28:46.221 --> 01:28:48.156 region:rollup2
TREATMENT BUT THAT DOESN'T HAVE

01:28:47.322 --> 01:28:50.859 region:rollup2
TO BE THROUGH A WRITTEN

01:28:48.156 --> 01:28:52.160 region:rollup2

I WOULD HOPE THAT THEY DO HAVE

01:28:55.764 --> 01:28:59.334 region:rollup2

01:38:21.162 --> 01:38:25.166 region:rollup2
FOR. THE LOCAL BOARDS WIND UP

01:38:23.231 --> 01:38:27.135 region:rollup2
HAVING TO UTILIZE THEIR GENERAL

01:38:25.166 --> 01:38:30.405 region:rollup2

01:38:27.135 --> 01:38:32.807 region:rollup2
THOSE ACTIVITIES I WONDER SINCE.

01:38:30.405 --> 01:38:35.510 region:rollup2
WHEN WE LOOK AT THIS.

01:38:32.807 --> 01:38:38.079 region:rollup2
THE COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES.

01:38:35.510 --> 01:38:39.213 region:rollup2

01:38:41.382 --> 01:38:43.885 region:rollup2
BUT I WOULD A RESPONSE I WOULD

01:38:42.450 --> 01:38:45.887 region:rollup2

01:38:43.885 --> 01:38:47.422 region:rollup2
ISSUES COME TO US AND ASK FOR

01:38:45.887 --> 01:38:49.090 region:rollup2
MONEY. AND EVERY YEAR WE

01:38:47.422 --> 01:38:50.892 region:rollup2
GENEROUSLY GIVE THEM MONEY

01:38:49.090 --> 01:38:52.226 region:rollup2
THAT'S WHY WE'VE CREATED A PATH

01:38:50.892 --> 01:38:53.961 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO TRAIN THESE HEALTH

01:38:52.226 --> 01:38:54.996 region:rollup2

AT.

01:39:02.570 --> 01:39:06.240 region:rollup2
FOR THE REFINING SO THAT WE

01:39:04.505 --> 01:39:07.675 region:rollup2
LIMIT THAT COMPLETE ABILITY FOR

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:10.211 region:rollup2

01:39:07.675 --> 01:39:11.179 region:rollup2

01:39:40.174 --> 01:39:43.277 region:rollup2
DEMOCRACY IN ACTION AND THIS IS

THE PROMISE OF NINE FORTY SIX

01:48:23.364 --> 01:48:27.801 region:rollup2
WASN'T FULLY REALIZED.

01:48:24.832 --> 01:48:29.303 region:rollup2
THERE WERE TOO MANY OBSTACLES

01:48:27.801 --> 01:48:29.737 region:rollup2

01:48:29.303 --> 01:48:31.772 region:rollup2

AND THERE WERE SOME THINGS THAT

01:48:42.416 --> 01:48:44.785 region:rollup2
PROBABLY IF WE WERE WRITING THAT

01:48:43.984 --> 01:48:46.487 region:rollup2
TODAY WE WOULD HAVE WRITTEN

YOU KNOW. AS FOR THE LOCATION

AND AND THEN RELEASE HOME WHEN

01:59:16.216 --> 01:59:19.519 region:rollup2
IT COULD BE. PROPERLY STRUCTURED

01:59:18.118 --> 01:59:20.754 region:rollup2
TO SUPPORT THE OPTIONAL BENEFIT

01:59:19.519 --> 01:59:23.156 region:rollup2

01:59:20.754 --> 01:59:25.125 region:rollup2
TOM YOU KNOW THE LIMITATION ON

01:59:25.125 --> 01:59:27.327 region:rollup2
REGARDING PARENT PARTICIPATION

01:59:26.393 --> 01:59:29.295 region:rollup2
AND THE LOCATION REMAINS A

01:59:27.327 --> 01:59:30.563 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

01:59:29.295 --> 01:59:32.899 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT IS OUR

01:59:30.563 --> 01:59:34.634 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT A CHILD.

01:59:32.899 --> 01:59:35.969 region:rollup2
WHICH.

01:59:34.634 --> 01:59:38.004 region:rollup2
DOES BETTER WHEN THEIR PARENTS

01:59:35.969 --> 01:59:39.172 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATES IN THEIR CARE IN

01:59:38.004 --> 01:59:40.273 region:rollup2
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE ADDED LANGUAGE

01:59:39.172 --> 01:59:41.841 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS TO SAY THAT IT'S

01:59:40.273 --> 01:59:43.643 region:rollup2
CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. I WOULD

01:59:41.841 --> 01:59:45.111 region:rollup2
ARGUE WE DON'T HAVE ANY MEDICAL

01:59:43.643 --> 01:59:46.312 region:rollup2
LITERATURE THAT SAYS THAT IT IS

01:59:45.111 --> 01:59:47.847 region:rollup2
CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE FOR THE

PARENT TO BE ENGAGED.

01:59:47.847 --> 01:59:49.616 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK IT'S JUST IT'S

01:59:48.681 --> 01:59:50.450 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AND IT'S A REAL

01:59:49.616 --> 01:59:52.519 region:rollup2

02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:30.083 region:rollup2
WORKING ON.

02:01:27.514 --> 02:01:31.451 region:rollup2
SO I'M I'M SUPPORTING IT I'D

02:01:30.083 --> 02:01:31.618 region:rollup2
LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR

02:01:31.451 --> 02:01:33.186 region:rollup2
AND.

02:01:31.618 --> 02:01:35.255 region:rollup2
.

02:01:33.186 --> 02:01:37.557 region:rollup2
I I I SOME OF THE ARGUMENTS HAVE

02:01:35.255 --> 02:01:39.926 region:rollup2
STILL STAYED THE SAME.

02:01:37.557 --> 02:01:42.028 region:rollup2
AND EVEN WHEN I'M READING IT AND

02:01:39.926 --> 02:01:43.797 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT. YOUR SAYING THAT

02:01:42.028 --> 02:01:46.733 region:rollup2
IT'S EXPAND THE AT SCHOOL WATER

02:01:43.797 --> 02:01:48.134 region:rollup2
DOWN BUT IT'S ALSO RAISED COSTA

02:01:46.733 --> 02:01:49.302 region:rollup2
HOW'S IT GONNA RAISE COSTS IF

02:01:48.134 --> 02:01:50.270 region:rollup2
IT'S WATERED DOWN.

02:01:49.302 --> 02:01:52.572 region:rollup2
BUT IS A LITTLE BIT OF

02:01:50.270 --> 02:01:53.973 region:rollup2
CONTRADICTORY MESSAGES HERE SO.

02:01:52.572 --> 02:01:55.642 region:rollup2
IF YOU WANT TO TOUCH ON IT BE

02:01:53.973 --> 02:01:57.110 region:rollup2
HAPPY TO HEAR IT OUT BUT I ALSO

02:01:55.642 --> 02:02:00.180 region:rollup2
FEEL THAT.

02:01:57.110 --> 02:02:00.747 region:rollup2
EVEN WITH THE IMPROVEMENTS MADE.

02:02:00.180 --> 02:02:01.948 region:rollup2
THE ARGUMENTS ARE STILL THE

02:02:00.747 --> 02:02:04.584 region:rollup2
SAME.

02:02:01.948 --> 02:02:06.352 region:rollup2
SO.

02:02:04.584 --> 02:02:08.621 region:rollup2
CARE TO ELABORATE OR. ADDRESS

02:02:06.352 --> 02:02:09.222 region:rollup2
THAT. YOU KNOW I'M HAPPY TO SO

02:02:08.621 --> 02:02:12.091 region:rollup2
IF.

02:02:09.222 --> 02:02:13.793 region:rollup2
IF A PLAN IDENTIFIES THE PARENT

02:02:12.091 --> 02:02:15.895 region:rollup2
IS A PARTICIPATING IN THEIR

02:02:13.793 --> 02:02:18.031 region:rollup2
CHILDCARE FOR EXAMPLE. AND.

02:02:15.895 --> 02:02:19.766 region:rollup2
THAT CHILD IS FAILING TO.

02:02:18.031 --> 02:02:20.500 region:rollup2
.

02:02:19.766 --> 02:02:22.435 region:rollup2
PROGRESS IN THEIR TREATMENT

02:02:20.500 --> 02:02:24.237 region:rollup2
GOALS MY WE'RE TALKING A YEAR

02:02:22.435 --> 02:02:25.872 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN MONTHS TWO YEARS INTO

02:02:24.237 --> 02:02:27.073 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AND THEY'RE STILL

02:02:25.872 --> 02:02:28.875 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T PROGRESSED AS THEY

02:02:27.073 --> 02:02:31.144 region:rollup2
SHOULD BASED ON THEIR DIAGNOSIS

02:02:28.875 --> 02:02:32.712 region:rollup2
AND. EXPERIENCE WITH APPLIED

02:02:31.144 --> 02:02:34.280 region:rollup2
BEAT YOU KNOW WITH THAT THE. A

02:02:32.712 --> 02:02:36.149 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS HAVE YOU COULD

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:37.684 region:rollup2
QUESTION IS IT BECAUSE THE

02:02:36.149 --> 02:02:39.185 region:rollup2
PARENTS ARE PARTICIPATING AND SO

02:02:37.684 --> 02:02:40.420 region:rollup2
WHAT WILL HAPPEN IF THE PARENTS

02:02:39.185 --> 02:02:41.688 region:rollup2
ARE PARTICIPATING IN THAT CHILD

02:02:40.420 --> 02:02:43.122 region:rollup2
DOESN'T PROGRESS.

02:02:41.688 --> 02:02:44.757 region:rollup2
MY NUMBER'S CONCERN IS THAT THE

02:02:43.122 --> 02:02:46.593 region:rollup2
HOURS THEY'RE CURRENTLY GETTING

02:02:44.757 --> 02:02:47.760 region:rollup2
TWENTY HOURS OF ABA WEEK THAT

02:02:46.593 --> 02:02:49.829 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA GET THIRTY OR

02:02:47.760 --> 02:02:51.297 region:rollup2
THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY. SOMETHING

02:02:49.829 --> 02:02:53.499 region:rollup2
IS GOING TO HAVE TO.

02:02:51.297 --> 02:02:54.601 region:rollup2
HAPPENED HER CURVE TO MAKE UP

02:02:53.499 --> 02:02:55.969 region:rollup2
FOR THE DEFICIT THE PARAMOUNT

02:02:54.601 --> 02:03:01.341 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN THEIR TREATMENT

02:02:55.969 --> 02:03:02.976 region:rollup2
AND THAT WILL INCREASE COSTS.

02:03:01.341 --> 02:03:04.444 region:rollup2
AND. THROUGH THIS HAIRCUT MAY AT

02:03:02.976 --> 02:03:05.778 region:rollup2
A ONE OF THE REASONS THE

02:03:04.444 --> 02:03:07.714 region:rollup2
ARGUMENTS HAVE REMAINED THE SAME

02:03:05.778 --> 02:03:08.348 region:rollup2
IS BECAUSE THE ISSUE HAS

02:03:07.714 --> 02:03:09.349 region:rollup2
REMAINED THE SAME ARE CONCERNED

02:03:08.348 --> 02:03:11.517 region:rollup2
ABOUT WATERING DOWN THE

02:03:09.349 --> 02:03:12.819 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IS SIMPLY THIS IF YOU

02:03:11.517 --> 02:03:14.587 region:rollup2
ALLOW INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT

02:03:12.819 --> 02:03:16.589 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED. TO PROVIDE THESE

02:03:14.587 --> 02:03:18.625 region:rollup2
SERVICES TO CHILDREN AND THERE'S

02:03:16.589 --> 02:03:19.993 region:rollup2
NO DEMONSTRATED AYE IMPROVEMENT

02:03:18.625 --> 02:03:22.495 region:rollup2
TO THE SERB ADD TO THE CHILD'S

02:03:19.993 --> 02:03:24.464 region:rollup2
BEHAVIOR THOSE CHILDREN THEN AND

02:03:22.495 --> 02:03:25.565 region:rollup2
UP REQUIRING ADDITIONAL SERVICES

02:03:24.464 --> 02:03:26.966 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN NEEDED.

02:03:25.565 --> 02:03:28.835 region:rollup2
HAD THEY RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE

02:03:26.966 --> 02:03:30.403 region:rollup2
TREATMENT IN THE FIRST PLACE SO

02:03:28.835 --> 02:03:32.171 region:rollup2
THAT IS THE CORE OF OUR CONCERN

02:03:30.403 --> 02:03:33.506 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE WATERING DOWN OF THE

02:03:32.171 --> 02:03:35.241 region:rollup2

02:07:01.047 --> 02:07:04.951 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT'S WHAT WHAT THE

02:07:03.015 --> 02:07:06.853 region:rollup2
HEART OF THIS BILL IS VERY.

02:07:04.951 --> 02:07:08.588 region:rollup2
IT'S BECOME.

02:07:06.853 --> 02:07:09.755 region:rollup2
MORE COMPLICATED BECAUSE IS THE

02:07:08.588 --> 02:07:11.724 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER HIS ARYAN WE'VE

02:07:09.755 --> 02:07:13.559 region:rollup2
WORKED.

02:07:11.724 --> 02:07:14.360 region:rollup2
FOR FOUR YEARS I THINK THE

02:07:13.559 --> 02:07:16.395 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLY MEMBER DID IT FOR TWO.

02:07:14.360 --> 02:07:18.231 region:rollup2
.

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:20.399 region:rollup2
AND THEN FOR THE LAST TWO. WE'VE

02:07:18.231 --> 02:07:22.768 region:rollup2
TRIED TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THE

02:07:20.399 --> 02:07:23.302 region:rollup2
NUANCES AND THE CONCERNS BUT THE

02:07:22.768 --> 02:07:24.103 region:rollup2
HEART OF THE BILL IS VERY

02:07:23.302 --> 02:07:25.738 region:rollup2
SIMPLE.

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:27.807 region:rollup2
THE HEART OF THE BILL IS YOUR

02:07:25.738 --> 02:07:29.775 region:rollup2
PHYSICIAN.

02:07:27.807 --> 02:07:32.211 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBES

02:07:29.775 --> 02:07:34.680 region:rollup2
A MEDICALLY NECESSARY.

02:07:32.211 --> 02:07:35.715 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT.

02:07:34.680 --> 02:07:37.450 region:rollup2
AND WHETHER THAT SHOULD BE

02:07:35.715 --> 02:07:37.950 region:rollup2
COVERED ARE NOT COVERED UNDER

02:07:37.450 --> 02:07:41.687 region:rollup2
EXISTING LAW ONLY ONE IS

02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:43.189 region:rollup2
COVERED.

02:07:41.687 --> 02:07:46.058 region:rollup2
WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU

02:07:43.189 --> 02:07:48.060 region:rollup2
HAVE A CHILD OR GRANDCHILD AND

02:07:46.058 --> 02:07:50.530 region:rollup2
THAT CHILD'S PHYSICIAN.

02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:51.998 region:rollup2
DESCRIBES A NOW THEIR TREATMENT.

02:07:50.530 --> 02:07:53.299 region:rollup2
U. S. APPARENT DON'T HAVE TO SAY

02:07:51.998 --> 02:07:54.367 region:rollup2
WELL I HAVE TO GO TO THIS ONE

02:07:53.299 --> 02:07:55.968 region:rollup2
THAT MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE FOR

02:07:54.367 --> 02:07:56.602 region:rollup2
THIS CHILD.

02:07:55.968 --> 02:07:58.437 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S THE ONLY ONE THAT

02:07:56.602 --> 02:08:00.306 region:rollup2
I GET REIMBURSED.

02:07:58.437 --> 02:08:02.108 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE ANALYZE A COMPLEX SINCE

02:08:00.306 --> 02:08:03.442 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROVIDER REQUIREMENTS

02:08:02.108 --> 02:08:06.178 region:rollup2
WE ESTABLISHED BY THE DDS.

02:08:03.442 --> 02:08:07.079 region:rollup2
.

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:09.448 region:rollup2
IN FACT SAID THAT HAVE YOU

02:08:07.079 --> 02:08:11.150 region:rollup2
SPOKEN TO THE DDS. AND WHAT WERE

02:08:09.448 --> 02:08:11.684 region:rollup2
SOME OF THEIR THOUGHTS IN

02:08:11.150 --> 02:08:14.820 region:rollup2
RESPONSE TO CHANGING THOSE

02:08:11.684 --> 02:08:16.989 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:18.457 region:rollup2
YEAH.

02:08:16.989 --> 02:08:19.559 region:rollup2
I'M SORRY I I DON'T SO I DON'T

02:08:18.457 --> 02:08:20.126 region:rollup2
MEAN TO CATCH OFF GUARD IF YOU

02:08:19.559 --> 02:08:21.427 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE AN ANSWER THAT'S

02:08:20.126 --> 02:08:23.529 region:rollup2
FINE.

02:08:21.427 --> 02:08:25.665 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM LIES IN IN THE WAY

02:08:23.529 --> 02:08:28.868 region:rollup2
THAT THROUGH THE. NINE FORTY SIX

02:08:25.665 --> 02:08:30.536 region:rollup2
WAS WRITTEN IS THE PROVIDERS.

02:08:28.868 --> 02:08:31.938 region:rollup2
THE WAY THE THE BILL DISK

02:08:30.536 --> 02:08:34.240 region:rollup2
DEFINES A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

02:08:31.938 --> 02:08:36.242 region:rollup2
TREATMENT IT SAYS ALL EVIDENCE

02:08:34.240 --> 02:08:38.010 region:rollup2
BASE TREATMENTS THAT ARE

02:08:36.242 --> 02:08:39.745 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED BY A PHYSICIAN OR A

02:08:38.010 --> 02:08:42.081 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIST.

02:08:39.745 --> 02:08:42.848 region:rollup2
I AM SORRY PSYCHOLOGIST.

02:08:42.081 --> 02:08:45.351 region:rollup2
BETTER.

02:08:42.848 --> 02:08:47.753 region:rollup2
PROVIDED BY IN THAT IT GIVES

02:08:45.351 --> 02:08:49.388 region:rollup2
THREE TIERS OF PROVIDERS

02:08:47.753 --> 02:08:50.890 region:rollup2
THE FIRST PROVIDER EVERYBODY'S

02:08:49.388 --> 02:08:52.592 region:rollup2
OKAY WHICH IS LICENSE HEALTH

02:08:50.890 --> 02:08:54.560 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS DOCTORS.

02:08:52.592 --> 02:08:56.429 region:rollup2
PSYCHOLOGISTS OF MARRIAGE AND

02:08:54.560 --> 02:08:57.296 region:rollup2
FAMILY THERAPISTS COUNSELORS AND

02:08:56.429 --> 02:08:58.197 region:rollup2
BOARD CERTIFIED BEHAVIOR

02:08:57.296 --> 02:09:00.233 region:rollup2
ANALYSTS FOR

02:08:58.197 --> 02:09:01.500 region:rollup2
PROVIDE ABA.

02:09:00.233 --> 02:09:02.935 region:rollup2
BUT THOSE PEOPLE ACTUALLY

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:03.536 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE SERVICES THEY

02:09:02.935 --> 02:09:05.905 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY SUPERVISE OTHERS WHO

02:09:03.536 --> 02:09:07.139 region:rollup2
DO.

02:09:05.905 --> 02:09:08.641 region:rollup2
THEN THE NEXT YEAR ARE THE

02:09:07.139 --> 02:09:10.409 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONALS AND THAT'S WHERE

02:09:08.641 --> 02:09:11.911 region:rollup2
WE RUN INTO THE PROBLEM.

02:09:10.409 --> 02:09:13.012 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE WERE WRITING THE THAT

02:09:11.911 --> 02:09:14.714 region:rollup2
THAT BILL WAS WRITTEN LATE IN

02:09:13.012 --> 02:09:16.382 region:rollup2
THE SESSION THEY TOOK THE

02:09:14.714 --> 02:09:17.450 region:rollup2
EXISTING VENDOR CODES FROM THE

02:09:16.382 --> 02:09:20.453 region:rollup2
REGIONAL CENTERS FROM TITLE

02:09:17.450 --> 02:09:21.787 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN. AND ALL OF THOSE WERE

02:09:20.453 --> 02:09:23.055 region:rollup2
ABA RELATED COATS

02:09:21.787 --> 02:09:23.656 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHERE WE SAY WE

02:09:23.055 --> 02:09:25.091 region:rollup2
CONTEND THAT IT WAS A DRAFTING

02:09:23.656 --> 02:09:27.026 region:rollup2
ERROR.

02:09:25.091 --> 02:09:28.694 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T ALLOW FOR

02:09:27.026 --> 02:09:30.963 region:rollup2
ANYTHING OTHER THAN A BE A

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:32.265 region:rollup2
TRAINED PROFESSIONALS

02:09:30.963 --> 02:09:33.332 region:rollup2
FIVE THE ACTUAL CODE NUMBERS

02:09:32.265 --> 02:09:35.701 region:rollup2
THAT WERE CITED IN THE ORIGINAL

02:09:33.332 --> 02:09:37.670 region:rollup2
BILL AND NARROWED IT TO ONLY ONE

02:09:35.701 --> 02:09:41.073 region:rollup2
TYPE AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM AND

02:09:37.670 --> 02:09:42.508 region:rollup2
THEN. THE THIRD PROVIDE OF PROOF

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:43.643 region:rollup2
PROVIDER LEVEL LISTA PARA

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:45.778 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL.

02:09:43.643 --> 02:09:47.713 region:rollup2
AND AGAIN IT'S CITED TO TITLE

02:09:45.778 --> 02:09:49.849 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN CODE AND AGAIN THOSE

02:09:47.713 --> 02:09:51.450 region:rollup2
ARE ABA RELATED.

02:09:49.849 --> 02:09:53.252 region:rollup2
COATS.

02:09:51.450 --> 02:09:54.954 region:rollup2
AND AS A RESULT THE INSURANCE

02:09:53.252 --> 02:09:56.055 region:rollup2
COMPANIES LOOKING AT SAYING WELL

02:09:54.954 --> 02:09:57.890 region:rollup2
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE ACTUALLY

02:09:56.055 --> 02:09:59.792 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE SERVICES.

02:09:57.890 --> 02:10:01.994 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE ABA TRAINED THERE FOR

02:09:59.792 --> 02:10:03.829 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE MUST ADMIT ABA

02:10:01.994 --> 02:10:04.930 region:rollup2
AND SO IF YOU'RE PROVIDE IF YOU

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:07.300 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBE ANYTHING ELSE WE DON'T

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:09.135 region:rollup2
HAVE TO COVER IT.

02:10:07.300 --> 02:10:10.670 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S AND THEREIN LIES THE

02:10:09.135 --> 02:10:12.371 region:rollup2
PROBLEM IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:10:10.670 --> 02:10:14.540 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT EVIDENCE BASED IT JUST

02:10:12.371 --> 02:10:16.842 region:rollup2
MEANS THERE ISN'T ANYBODY TO

02:10:14.540 --> 02:10:18.411 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SO BY PROVIDING THESE

02:10:16.842 --> 02:10:20.279 region:rollup2
ALREADY REGULAR STATE REGULATED

02:10:18.411 --> 02:10:22.915 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONS.

02:10:20.279 --> 02:10:24.583 region:rollup2
WHO BY THE WAY ARE MASTERS LEVEL

02:10:22.915 --> 02:10:25.518 region:rollup2
WORKING ON THEIR DOCTORATES AND

02:10:24.583 --> 02:10:26.085 region:rollup2
WHEN THEY GET THEIR DOCTORS

02:10:25.518 --> 02:10:27.720 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GOING TO BE IN THE

02:10:26.085 --> 02:10:29.555 region:rollup2
PROVIDER LEVEL THEY'RE ALREADY

02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:30.589 region:rollup2
LISTED IN THE LEGISLATION IN THE

02:10:29.555 --> 02:10:32.024 region:rollup2
PROVIDER LEVEL ONCE THEY GET

02:10:30.589 --> 02:10:33.159 region:rollup2
THEIR DOCTORATES?

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:35.428 region:rollup2
BUT.

02:10:33.159 --> 02:10:36.495 region:rollup2
THEY THEY'RE ALREADY WORKING

02:10:35.428 --> 02:10:38.130 region:rollup2
WITH REGIONAL CENTERS TO PROVIDE

02:10:36.495 --> 02:10:39.865 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

02:10:38.130 --> 02:10:41.100 region:rollup2
THERE WE'LL BE ABLE TO DO THAT

02:10:39.865 --> 02:10:42.668 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEY WILL EXPAND AND BE

02:10:41.100 --> 02:10:43.703 region:rollup2
ABLE TO DO THAT THAT BUT THEY

02:10:42.668 --> 02:10:44.737 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE TRAINED IN THE EAST

02:10:43.703 --> 02:10:45.338 region:rollup2
AND THE BAY REAL HEALTH

02:10:44.737 --> 02:10:46.739 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THEY'RE GOING TO BE

02:10:45.338 --> 02:10:48.808 region:rollup2
PROVIDING.

02:10:46.739 --> 02:10:50.609 region:rollup2

THANK YOU FOR READING THIS IF

YOU CAN.

02:10:59.018 --> 02:11:01.387 region:rollup2
HARD TO GET A COUPLE STEPS BACK

02:10:59.685 --> 02:11:02.822 region:rollup2
I THINK AT THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE

02:11:01.387 --> 02:11:03.422 region:rollup2
AND WE HAVEN'T BROUGHT UP THIS

02:11:02.822 --> 02:11:04.423 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT THIS YEAR WE HAVE IN

02:11:03.422 --> 02:11:05.758 region:rollup2
THE PAST.

02:11:04.423 --> 02:11:07.526 region:rollup2
IS IT NOT FORTY SIX

02:11:05.758 --> 02:11:08.060 region:rollup2
STATES THAT YOU CAN.

02:11:07.526 --> 02:11:09.428 region:rollup2
FUND.

02:11:08.060 --> 02:11:10.996 region:rollup2
FUNDERS TO PAY FOR APPLIED

02:11:09.428 --> 02:11:11.997 region:rollup2

EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:11:11.997 --> 02:11:15.067 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS.

02:11:13.933 --> 02:11:17.570 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS NOT THE FUNDERS

02:11:15.067 --> 02:11:20.139 region:rollup2
HERE ARE SORT OF THE PROVIDERS.

02:11:17.570 --> 02:11:20.806 region:rollup2
THE PLANS ARE NOT WILLING TO PAY

02:11:20.139 --> 02:11:23.342 region:rollup2
FOR ANYTHING THAT THEY DO NOT

02:11:20.806 --> 02:11:24.276 region:rollup2
TEAM EVIDENCE BASED.

02:11:23.342 --> 02:11:25.878 region:rollup2
AND TO APPLY BEHAVE ANALYSIS HAS

02:11:24.276 --> 02:11:26.979 region:rollup2
A RICH EVIDENCE BASED MANY OF

02:11:25.878 --> 02:11:28.547 region:rollup2
THESE OTHER TREATMENTS THAT ARE

02:11:26.979 --> 02:11:29.849 region:rollup2

02:11:28.547 --> 02:11:30.983 region:rollup2
FORTHCOMING EVIDENCE OR EMERGING

02:11:29.849 --> 02:11:33.018 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BUT THEY HAVEN'T REACH

02:11:30.983 --> 02:11:34.920 region:rollup2
THAT THRESHOLD.

02:11:33.018 --> 02:11:36.789 region:rollup2
AND AS IT RELATES YOUR QUESTION.

02:11:34.920 --> 02:11:38.457 region:rollup2
REGARDING CHANGING AT THE

02:11:36.789 --> 02:11:39.425 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROVIDERS

02:11:38.457 --> 02:11:40.826 region:rollup2
CHANGING THE REQUIREMENTS FOR

02:11:39.425 --> 02:11:41.794 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDERS DOES NOTHING TO

02:11:40.826 --> 02:11:43.596 region:rollup2
ADDRESS THE FUNDAMENTAL

02:11:41.794 --> 02:11:44.463 region:rollup2
THRESHOLD PROBLEM. ABOUT THESE

02:11:43.596 --> 02:11:48.734 region:rollup2
OTHER TREATMENTS BEING EVIDENCE

MISS WALDRON.

02:11:56.742 --> 02:12:02.047 region:rollup2
I FEEL LIKE THIS HAS THE

POTENTIAL TO GET CLOSE HAVE A

TRY AND THAT'S WHY THE BILL IS

02:12:18.397 --> 02:12:21.967 region:rollup2
INVOLVED TO WHERE IT'S AT YEAH I

DEFINITION OF WHAT'S IN NO.

02:12:32.745 --> 02:12:36.048 region:rollup2
THOSE CERTAIN TYPE OF TREATMENT

02:12:34.680 --> 02:12:36.682 region:rollup2
VERSUS ANOTHER.

02:12:36.048 --> 02:12:42.988 region:rollup2
ONE IN FIFTY I WANT TO SEE SOME

02:12:36.682 --> 02:12:44.457 region:rollup2
KIND OF

02:12:42.988 --> 02:12:45.591 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION I'M.

02:12:44.457 --> 02:12:48.327 region:rollup2
STRUGGLING WITH.

02:12:45.591 --> 02:12:50.162 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

02:12:48.327 --> 02:12:51.797 region:rollup2
CAN WE GET THERE I DON'T KNOW

02:12:50.162 --> 02:12:53.299 region:rollup2
BUT I. I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU

02:12:51.797 --> 02:12:55.534 region:rollup2
IN THE.

02:12:53.299 --> 02:12:57.536 region:rollup2
THREE PLUS YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN

02:12:55.534 --> 02:12:59.338 region:rollup2
FOR MAYOR WITH THIS PROCESS AND

02:12:57.536 --> 02:13:00.139 region:rollup2
I GO BACK TO WHEN ASSEMBLY

02:12:59.338 --> 02:13:01.674 region:rollup2
MEMBER DOES AREA HAD IT.

02:13:00.139 --> 02:13:03.943 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I KNOW SOME OF THE

02:13:01.674 --> 02:13:05.411 region:rollup2
PARENTS THAT. WERE ADVOCATES FOR

02:13:03.943 --> 02:13:09.081 region:rollup2
WHEN HE CARRIED THE BILL.

02:13:05.411 --> 02:13:09.381 region:rollup2
IT HAS BEEN A FUNDAMENTAL ISSUE

02:13:09.081 --> 02:13:10.683 region:rollup2
OF FRANKLY.

02:13:09.381 --> 02:13:11.317 region:rollup2
.

02:13:10.683 --> 02:13:16.021 region:rollup2
A MONOPOLY. WE HAVE TRIED AND WE

02:13:11.317 --> 02:13:17.756 region:rollup2
HAVE TAKEN

02:13:16.021 --> 02:13:18.991 region:rollup2
MANY MANY MANY SETS OF

02:13:17.756 --> 02:13:19.525 region:rollup2
AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW ASSEMBLY

02:13:18.991 --> 02:13:22.328 region:rollup2
MEMBER HIS ARYAN DID. BUT

02:13:19.525 --> 02:13:24.330 region:rollup2
FUNDAMENTALLY YOU HAVE A.

02:13:22.328 --> 02:13:27.099 region:rollup2
PROVIDER WHO WANTS TO MAINTAIN A

02:13:24.330 --> 02:13:28.400 region:rollup2
MONOPOLY BECAUSE.

02:13:27.099 --> 02:13:30.069 region:rollup2
WE KEEP BOTH SAYING EVIDENCE

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:31.570 region:rollup2
BASED.

02:13:30.069 --> 02:13:33.973 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S WHAT THE BILL SAYS.

02:13:31.570 --> 02:13:35.474 region:rollup2
SO IF.

02:13:33.973 --> 02:13:37.009 region:rollup2
WE SUPPORT EVIDENCE BASED

02:13:35.474 --> 02:13:37.810 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THERE SHOULD BE NO

02:13:37.009 --> 02:13:40.646 region:rollup2
DISCUSSION THERE SHOULD BE NO

02:13:37.810 --> 02:13:41.380 region:rollup2
ARGUMENT.

02:13:40.646 --> 02:13:43.516 region:rollup2
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOCTOR

02:13:41.380 --> 02:13:44.984 region:rollup2
PRESCRIBED.

02:13:43.516 --> 02:13:46.785 region:rollup2
AGAIN THE HEALTHCARE

02:13:44.984 --> 02:13:48.954 region:rollup2
PROFESSIONAL.

02:13:46.785 --> 02:13:50.823 region:rollup2
IS IN CHARGE.

02:13:48.954 --> 02:13:52.458 region:rollup2
OF THAT FAMILIES HEALTH.

02:13:50.823 --> 02:13:54.260 region:rollup2
SAYING WE THINK YOUR SON OR

02:13:52.458 --> 02:13:56.495 region:rollup2
DAUGHTER.

02:13:54.260 --> 02:13:57.363 region:rollup2
WHAT RESPOND WELL TO THIS

02:13:56.495 --> 02:14:00.399 region:rollup2
EVIDENCE BASED TREATMENT OVER

02:13:57.363 --> 02:14:02.501 region:rollup2
THIS ONE?

02:14:00.399 --> 02:14:03.702 region:rollup2
IT SHOULD BE COVERED.

02:14:02.501 --> 02:14:05.971 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THAT'S THE KEY POINT

02:14:03.702 --> 02:14:07.706 region:rollup2
WERE NOT TALKING ABOUT

02:14:05.971 --> 02:14:11.076 region:rollup2
EXPERIMENTAL RETIREMENT EVIDENCE

02:14:07.706 --> 02:14:12.077 region:rollup2
BASED TREATMENT. BUT UNDER

02:14:11.076 --> 02:14:12.745 region:rollup2
CURRENT LAW.

02:14:12.077 --> 02:14:13.779 region:rollup2
ONLY ONE OF THOSE EVIDENCE BASED

02:14:12.745 --> 02:14:14.914 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS

02:14:13.779 --> 02:14:17.182 region:rollup2
QUALIFIES.

02:14:14.914 --> 02:14:19.618 region:rollup2
FOR INSURANCE COVERAGE.

02:14:17.182 --> 02:14:21.420 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE FUNDAMENTAL PIECE

02:14:19.618 --> 02:14:23.222 region:rollup2
SO WITHIN DEFINITIONS WERE OPEN

02:14:21.420 --> 02:14:24.757 region:rollup2
TO THOSE DISCUSSIONS

02:14:23.222 --> 02:14:26.659 region:rollup2
WE'VE SHOWN THAT FOR TWO YEARS

02:14:24.757 --> 02:14:28.360 region:rollup2
AND BEYOND.

02:14:26.659 --> 02:14:30.529 region:rollup2
BUT AT SOME POINT. THERE'S A

02:14:28.360 --> 02:14:31.030 region:rollup2
PHILOSOPHICAL DIVIDE OVER

02:14:30.529 --> 02:14:32.765 region:rollup2
WHETHER WE SHOULD HAVE A

02:14:31.030 --> 02:14:34.533 region:rollup2
MONOPOLY.

02:14:32.765 --> 02:14:36.235 region:rollup2
AND OFTEN TREAT ALL CHILDREN THE

02:14:34.533 --> 02:14:37.970 region:rollup2
SAME WAY OR WE SHOULD RECOGNIZE

02:14:36.235 --> 02:14:39.705 region:rollup2
THAT EVERY CHILD IS DIFFERENT

02:14:37.970 --> 02:14:41.640 region:rollup2
AND WHITE RESPOND TO DIFFERENT

02:14:39.705 --> 02:14:44.910 region:rollup2
TREATMENTS DIFFERENTLY. UNDER

02:14:41.640 --> 02:14:46.345 region:rollup2
THE CARE OF THEIR PEDIATRICIAN.

02:14:44.910 --> 02:14:49.381 region:rollup2
WELL THAT'S WHY THEY SAY THIS

02:14:46.345 --> 02:14:50.749 region:rollup2
POSSUM SPECTRUM BECAUSE NOT

02:14:49.381 --> 02:14:51.850 region:rollup2
EVERY CHILD RESTING PLACE.

02:14:50.749 --> 02:14:54.219 region:rollup2
I HAVE A VERY DEAR FRIEND WHOSE

02:14:51.850 --> 02:14:56.121 region:rollup2
SON HAS AUTISM AN. YOU KNOW WHAT

02:14:54.219 --> 02:14:57.389 region:rollup2
THEY'VE HAD TO GO THROUGH. AND

02:14:56.121 --> 02:14:59.224 region:rollup2
YOU'D WANT ESPECIALLY IN THE

02:14:57.389 --> 02:15:00.726 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING YOU WANT TO GET THE

02:14:59.224 --> 02:15:02.695 region:rollup2
TREATMENT TO THEM AS SOON AS

02:15:00.726 --> 02:15:04.129 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE RIGHT AND IT COULD BE

02:15:02.695 --> 02:15:05.764 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE COMING A PUPPY.

02:15:04.129 --> 02:15:07.099 region:rollup2
CORRECT LISTENING TO MUSIC YOU

02:15:05.764 --> 02:15:08.968 region:rollup2
KNOW HAVING SOMEONE WHO CAN

02:15:07.099 --> 02:15:10.369 region:rollup2
TEACH THEM.

02:15:08.968 --> 02:15:12.905 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT THAT YOU KNOW

02:15:10.369 --> 02:15:14.039 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT'S NOT. TAKING A DRUG OR

02:15:12.905 --> 02:15:15.908 region:rollup2
DAY MAYBE IT'S A COUNSELOR WHO

02:15:14.039 --> 02:15:17.509 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDS HOW TO. YOU KNOW

02:15:15.908 --> 02:15:18.477 region:rollup2
BABIES LEARNING A SIGN LANGUAGE

02:15:17.509 --> 02:15:20.279 region:rollup2
OR SOMETHING A DIFFERENT WAY TO

02:15:18.477 --> 02:15:22.281 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATE. WHAT THEY'RE

02:15:20.279 --> 02:15:25.117 region:rollup2
FEELING THAT WOULD HELP THEM

02:15:22.281 --> 02:15:25.751 region:rollup2
HEAL SO THAT'S WHY I ADMIT THE

02:15:25.117 --> 02:15:28.687 region:rollup2
FRUSTRATION AVOCET THAT FEEL

02:15:25.751 --> 02:15:29.822 region:rollup2
LIKE IT COULD BE CLOSE? AND

02:15:28.687 --> 02:15:31.357 region:rollup2
YOU'VE COME THIS FAR.

02:15:29.822 --> 02:15:33.025 region:rollup2
SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO WORK OUT I

02:15:31.357 --> 02:15:34.960 region:rollup2
MEAN I I CAN'T TELL YOU. IF

02:15:33.025 --> 02:15:38.564 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SPECIFIC PIECE OF

02:15:34.960 --> 02:15:39.598 region:rollup2
LANGUAGE BUT WE HAD A MEETING

02:15:38.564 --> 02:15:42.835 region:rollup2
YESTERDAY I MEAN WE'RE NOT.

02:15:39.598 --> 02:15:44.003 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE.

02:15:42.835 --> 02:15:45.771 region:rollup2

OF WORKED AS WELL I MEAN.

02:15:45.771 --> 02:15:49.775 region:rollup2

02:15:48.474 --> 02:15:54.580 region:rollup2
HEALTH COMMITTEE OF A SIX YEAR

02:15:49.775 --> 02:15:58.684 region:rollup2

AROUND DDS IF THEY WOULD JUST

02:16:06.358 --> 02:16:08.794 region:rollup2

HELPFUL.

KNOW.

02:16:32.518 --> 02:16:34.553 region:rollup2
WHO AMONGST US DOESN'T KNOW A

02:16:33.152 --> 02:16:36.255 region:rollup2
FAMILY OR HAVE A FAMILY MEMBER

02:16:34.553 --> 02:16:38.924 region:rollup2
WHO HASN'T BEEN AFFECTED?

02:16:36.255 --> 02:16:39.458 region:rollup2
BY ARTISTS WHO AMONGST US

02:16:38.924 --> 02:16:41.894 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAVE.

02:16:39.458 --> 02:16:42.895 region:rollup2
A RELATIVE OR TWO I MEAN I HAVE

02:16:41.894 --> 02:16:44.329 region:rollup2
TWO DAUGHTERS AND THEY ARE NIGHT

02:16:42.895 --> 02:16:45.531 region:rollup2
AND DAY.

02:16:44.329 --> 02:16:47.533 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY AND TOTALLY

02:16:45.531 --> 02:16:50.502 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT HUMAN BEINGS.

02:16:47.533 --> 02:16:52.438 region:rollup2
TO ME I'M ASKING YOU TO THINK

02:16:50.502 --> 02:16:53.939 region:rollup2
OF THIS YES AS A LEGISLATURE.

02:16:52.438 --> 02:16:55.274 region:rollup2
LEGISLATOR BUT ALSO THINK OF IT

02:16:53.939 --> 02:16:57.209 region:rollup2
AS A PARENT A GRANDPARENT AN

02:16:55.274 --> 02:16:58.944 region:rollup2
AUNT OR AN UNCLE. AND THINK

02:16:57.209 --> 02:17:01.080 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOUR PEDIATRICIAN PULLING

02:16:58.944 --> 02:17:02.314 region:rollup2
YOU INTO. YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER

02:17:01.080 --> 02:17:04.750 region:rollup2
GRANDCHILD'S.

02:17:02.314 --> 02:17:06.785 region:rollup2
ROOM AND SAYING I WOULD LIKE TO

02:17:04.750 --> 02:17:08.020 region:rollup2
SEND THEM OUT TO A TREATMENT.

02:17:06.785 --> 02:17:09.421 region:rollup2
BUT UNFORTUNATELY IT'S NOT

02:17:08.020 --> 02:17:10.622 region:rollup2
COVERED BY YOUR INSURANCE

02:17:09.421 --> 02:17:12.424 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT DOESN'T FIT INTO THE

02:17:10.622 --> 02:17:14.393 region:rollup2
MONOPOLY BOX.

02:17:12.424 --> 02:17:15.494 region:rollup2
BUT I THINK YOUR SON OR DAUGHTER

02:17:14.393 --> 02:17:17.362 region:rollup2
WOULD RESPOND WELL. TO THAT

02:17:15.494 --> 02:17:19.398 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

02:17:17.362 --> 02:17:20.265 region:rollup2
AND SO YOU DIG DEEP AND YOU PAY

02:17:19.398 --> 02:17:21.366 region:rollup2
FOR THAT TREATMENT YOURSELF

02:17:20.265 --> 02:17:22.601 region:rollup2
ALONE BEHOLD YOUR CHILD COMES

02:17:21.366 --> 02:17:24.069 region:rollup2
HOME.

02:17:22.601 --> 02:17:25.737 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY IS RESPONDING TO

02:17:24.069 --> 02:17:27.739 region:rollup2
THAT OTHER TREATMENT BECAUSE IT

02:17:25.737 --> 02:17:29.374 region:rollup2
IS EVIDENCE BASED BECAUSE THERE

02:17:27.739 --> 02:17:30.642 region:rollup2
IS A FACILITY. IN YOUR

02:17:29.374 --> 02:17:32.444 region:rollup2
NEIGHBORHOOD AND BECAUSE YOUR

02:17:30.642 --> 02:17:33.879 region:rollup2
DOCTOR RECOMMENDED IT. AND THEN

02:17:32.444 --> 02:17:35.681 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WELL I CAN'T

02:17:33.879 --> 02:17:36.648 region:rollup2
AFFORD WHAT'S IN THE BEST

02:17:35.681 --> 02:17:38.417 region:rollup2
INTERESTS OF MY CHILD.

02:17:36.648 --> 02:17:39.752 region:rollup2
I HAVE TO GO.

02:17:38.417 --> 02:17:41.220 region:rollup2
BECAUSE MY INSURANCE WILL ONLY

02:17:39.752 --> 02:17:43.155 region:rollup2
PAY FOR SOMETHING ELSE THAT MAY

02:17:41.220 --> 02:17:43.755 region:rollup2
HELP ONE OF MY CHILDREN.

02:17:43.155 --> 02:17:46.024 region:rollup2
BUT IS IT GONNA HELP ALL OF MY

02:17:43.755 --> 02:17:47.960 region:rollup2
CHILDREN.

02:17:46.024 --> 02:17:49.561 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD NOT HAVE A MONOPOLY ON

02:17:47.960 --> 02:17:51.430 region:rollup2
A TREATMENT WHEN A CHILD'S WELL

02:17:49.561 --> 02:17:52.531 region:rollup2
BEING IS AT STAKE.

02:17:51.430 --> 02:17:54.066 region:rollup2
AND WE SHOULD DO THE RIGHT THING

02:17:52.531 --> 02:17:55.334 region:rollup2
AFTER SIX YEAR JOURNEY AND

02:17:54.066 --> 02:17:56.401 region:rollup2

EXPRESSES THE OPPOSITE GENDER

02:25:40.732 --> 02:25:44.636 region:rollup2
AND THEN WE HAVE ANY REVERSIBLE.

02:25:42.167 --> 02:25:47.105 region:rollup2
SURGERY ASIDE FROM THE OBVIOUS

02:25:44.636 --> 02:25:49.107 region:rollup2

02:25:47.105 --> 02:25:52.077 region:rollup2
TO PERMANENT LOST A LOSS OF

02:25:49.107 --> 02:25:53.845 region:rollup2

ALTHOUGH A SMALL PORTION OF

INTERSEX INFANTS REQUIRE

02:26:25.510 --> 02:26:30.348 region:rollup2
IMMEDIATE MEDICAL INTERVENTION

FROM SAN FRANCISCO AS AN

02:27:51.229 --> 02:27:55.066 region:rollup2
INTERSEX PERSON.

02:27:52.897 --> 02:27:57.035 region:rollup2
AND I'M HERE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT

02:27:55.066 --> 02:27:58.670 region:rollup2
MY CONFIDENCE AND MY HAPPINESS

02:27:57.035 --> 02:28:00.638 region:rollup2
ARE OWED TO THE FACT THAT I HAD

02:27:58.670 --> 02:28:02.307 region:rollup2
MY OWN DECISION. IN RECEIVING

02:28:00.638 --> 02:28:03.441 region:rollup2
GENITAL SURGERY.

02:28:02.307 --> 02:28:04.943 region:rollup2
I MEAN MY CHOICE WHEN I WAS OLD

02:28:03.441 --> 02:28:06.811 region:rollup2
ENOUGH TO CONSENT AND THAT'S THE

02:28:04.943 --> 02:28:09.414 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT THING MY PARENTS DID

02:28:06.811 --> 02:28:10.782 region:rollup2
IT. MY DOCTORS DID IT. I DID.

02:28:09.414 --> 02:28:12.517 region:rollup2
AND THESE TYPES OF SURGERIES ARE

02:28:10.782 --> 02:28:13.251 region:rollup2
NOT MEDICALLY NECESSARY. ANY

02:28:12.517 --> 02:28:14.886 region:rollup2
TYPE OF SURGERY THAT MIGHT

02:28:13.251 --> 02:28:16.888 region:rollup2
CHANGE APPEARANCE OR SEXUAL

02:28:16.888 --> 02:28:20.558 region:rollup2
HIGH RISK OF FAILURE.

02:28:19.257 --> 02:28:22.660 region:rollup2
MUST BE OUR OWN DECISION.

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:23.828 region:rollup2

EFFECTS THEY MIGHT HOUSE.

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:29.768 region:rollup2
FOR THE REST OF OUR LIVES.

02:28:28.833 --> 02:28:30.735 region:rollup2
INTERSEX CHILDREN BORN WITH

02:28:29.768 --> 02:28:32.537 region:rollup2
GENITAL DIFFERENCES RARELY GET

02:28:30.735 --> 02:28:34.005 region:rollup2
THAT CHANCE.

02:28:32.537 --> 02:28:35.340 region:rollup2
THE MOST DRASTIC AND INVASIVE

02:28:34.005 --> 02:28:37.542 region:rollup2
OPTION IS CHOSEN FOR US BEFORE

02:28:35.340 --> 02:28:38.777 region:rollup2

02:28:38.777 --> 02:28:42.347 region:rollup2
ANTI SURGERY. WERE PRO CONSENT

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:43.181 region:rollup2

PEOPLE WHO CAN MAKE THIS

02:28:43.181 --> 02:28:47.152 region:rollup2
DECISION FOR THEMSELVES.

02:28:45.717 --> 02:28:49.220 region:rollup2
MEDICINE MUST SERVE THE BEST

02:28:47.152 --> 02:28:50.155 region:rollup2
INTEREST OF THE PATIENT.

02:28:49.220 --> 02:28:53.091 region:rollup2
NOT OTHERS WHO ARE UNCOMFORTABLE

02:28:50.155 --> 02:28:54.359 region:rollup2
WITH THEIR DIFFERENCES.

TAKE CONVERSION THERAPY A

02:28:54.359 --> 02:28:57.162 region:rollup2
PRACTICE THAT'S HARMFUL TO

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:58.630 region:rollup2
CHILDREN. AND IS CHOSEN ONLY TO

02:28:57.162 --> 02:29:00.465 region:rollup2
EASE A PARENT OR AUTHORITIES

02:28:58.630 --> 02:29:01.466 region:rollup2
SOCIAL DISCOMFORT.

02:29:00.465 --> 02:29:04.102 region:rollup2
CONVERSION THERAPY HAS BEEN

02:29:01.466 --> 02:29:05.470 region:rollup2
BANNED IN TWELVE STATES.

02:29:04.102 --> 02:29:07.238 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY GENERAL SURGERY ON

PARENTAL UNEASE OR THE MERE

02:29:13.144 --> 02:29:16.247 region:rollup2
POSSIBILITY OF LOCKER ROOM

02:29:14.412 --> 02:29:16.881 region:rollup2
BULLYING CANNOT JUSTIFY A

02:29:16.247 --> 02:29:18.750 region:rollup2
DECISION WITH SUCH HIGH RISK TO

02:29:16.881 --> 02:29:19.918 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT.

02:29:18.750 --> 02:29:21.352 region:rollup2
WHAT IF YOU COULD NOT SEX IS AN

02:29:19.918 --> 02:29:22.921 region:rollup2
ADULT BECAUSE OF A DECISION THAT

02:29:21.352 --> 02:29:24.422 region:rollup2
SOMEONE MADE HE WAS A BABY?

02:29:22.921 --> 02:29:25.557 region:rollup2
WHAT IF YOU WERE STERILIZED AS A

02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:27.492 region:rollup2
BABY AND THAT DECISION WAS MADE

02:29:25.557 --> 02:29:30.195 region:rollup2
FOR YOU?

02:29:27.492 --> 02:29:31.229 region:rollup2
THESE ARE STORIES PLEASE PLEASE

LISTEN TO INTERSEX PEOPLE SO

02:29:31.229 --> 02:29:35.300 region:rollup2
THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN TO HAVE

02:29:32.597 --> 02:29:36.501 region:rollup2
TO HAPPEN TO ANYONE ELSE.

02:29:35.300 --> 02:29:37.435 region:rollup2
PERHAPS SOME INTERSEX PEOPLE

02:29:36.501 --> 02:29:39.170 region:rollup2
WILL BE GLAD THAT THEIR PARENTS

02:29:37.435 --> 02:29:39.737 region:rollup2
MADE A SURGICAL DECISION FOR

02:29:39.170 --> 02:29:40.905 region:rollup2
THEM AND THAT'S FINE THAT'S

02:29:39.737 --> 02:29:42.073 region:rollup2

02:29:40.905 --> 02:29:43.775 region:rollup2

02:30:06.764 --> 02:30:08.533 region:rollup2
THE QUALITY OF THE TOOLS AND

02:30:07.365 --> 02:30:10.101 region:rollup2
CHANGE THE FACT THAT AN INFANT

02:30:08.533 --> 02:30:11.503 region:rollup2

THIS RESOLUTION IS TO SUPPORT

02:39:40.070 --> 02:39:42.640 region:rollup2

EXACT OPPOSITE OUTCOME.

02:39:47.344 --> 02:39:49.980 region:rollup2
THIS IS BECAUSE THE INFORMATION

THAT WAS PROVIDED TO DRAFT THIS

02:39:49.980 --> 02:39:54.385 region:rollup2

02:40:04.962 --> 02:40:08.432 region:rollup2
IT'S A CONDITION THAT CAUSES TOO

02:40:06.096 --> 02:40:09.066 region:rollup2
MUCH TESTOSTERONE TO BE PRODUCED

02:40:08.432 --> 02:40:10.534 region:rollup2

02:40:09.066 --> 02:40:12.236 region:rollup2

MUCH LIKE A* AND*.

02:40:13.537 --> 02:40:16.307 region:rollup2
BUT DESPITE THE EXCESS

02:40:14.672 --> 02:40:17.374 region:rollup2
TESTOSTERONE THEY ARE GIRLS AND

02:40:16.307 --> 02:40:18.876 region:rollup2
AS THEY GROW UP THEY IDENTIFY AS

02:40:17.374 --> 02:40:20.244 region:rollup2
GIRLS.

02:40:18.876 --> 02:40:21.846 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GENETICALLY FEMALE AND

02:40:20.244 --> 02:40:23.180 region:rollup2
AS ADULTS THEY IDENTIFIES WOMEN

02:40:21.846 --> 02:40:24.348 region:rollup2
IN WHEN THEY ARE SURVEYS THEY

02:40:23.180 --> 02:40:26.250 region:rollup2

THEY WERE PROVIDED SURGERY THAT

02:40:26.250 --> 02:40:29.053 region:rollup2
ALLOW THEM TO GROW UP AS GIRLS.

02:40:28.085 --> 02:40:29.653 region:rollup2
YOU HAVE LETTERS FROM THESE

02:40:29.053 --> 02:40:31.021 region:rollup2

02:40:31.021 --> 02:40:33.390 region:rollup2
THIS RESOLUTION WOULD FORCE

02:40:31.889 --> 02:40:34.492 region:rollup2
THESE GIRLS TO GROW UP WITH THE

PHYSICAL APPEARANCE AND THAT'S

02:40:34.492 --> 02:40:37.361 region:rollup2
IT DOES NOT MATCH THEIR IDENTITY

02:40:36.093 --> 02:40:38.662 region:rollup2
WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CAUSE

02:40:37.361 --> 02:40:39.997 region:rollup2

02:47:09.419 --> 02:47:12.422 region:rollup2
COMPLEX.

ONE OF THE. LEGISLATION TO BAN.

02:47:41.285 --> 02:47:44.388 region:rollup2

02:47:42.252 --> 02:47:45.255 region:rollup2
MEDICALLY UNNECESSARY THE PAST

02:47:44.388 --> 02:47:47.224 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE HOUSES AND THEN A

02:48:28.131 --> 02:48:32.069 region:rollup2
OPPOSED HAS REMOVED ITS

02:48:29.399 --> 02:48:32.869 region:rollup2
OPPOSITION WE. WE DID IT IS NOT

02:48:32.069 --> 02:48:34.371 region:rollup2
ACCURATE TO SAY THAT WE'VE NOT

02:48:32.869 --> 02:48:35.839 region:rollup2
BEEN SPEAKING TO THE MEDICAL

02:48:34.371 --> 02:48:38.675 region:rollup2
PROFESSION WE'VE. ENGAGED

02:48:35.839 --> 02:48:40.077 region:rollup2
EXTENSIVELY AND CMI HAS REMOVED

02:48:38.675 --> 02:48:41.612 region:rollup2
ITS OPPOSITION AND AS A RESULT

02:48:40.077 --> 02:48:43.613 region:rollup2
OF SOME AMENDMENTS.

02:48:41.612 --> 02:48:45.649 region:rollup2
THAT WE TALK ABOUT THEIR LOCAL

02:48:43.613 --> 02:48:47.284 region:rollup2
MEDICAL SOCIETIES THAT AND AT

02:48:45.649 --> 02:48:48.986 region:rollup2
THE OUTSET WANTED TO.

02:48:47.284 --> 02:48:51.321 region:rollup2
DORIS THE BILL.

02:48:48.986 --> 02:48:53.390 region:rollup2
BUT THEY WANT ONE CM A

02:48:51.321 --> 02:48:53.991 region:rollup2
TEMPORARILY CAME ON OPPOSITION

THEY FELT THEY WERE PRECLUDED

02:48:53.991 --> 02:48:55.993 region:rollup2
FROM.

02:48:55.325 --> 02:48:58.462 region:rollup2
FROM DOING THAT THERE IS

02:48:55.993 --> 02:48:59.830 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY A ROBUST DEBATE

02:48:58.462 --> 02:49:01.932 region:rollup2
OCCURRING WITHIN THE MEDICAL

02:48:59.830 --> 02:49:03.934 region:rollup2
PROFESSION. AS WE MOVE FORWARD

02:49:01.932 --> 02:49:04.701 region:rollup2
IN TIME AND REALIZE THAT SOME OF

02:49:03.934 --> 02:49:06.737 region:rollup2
THE WAYS WE'VE DONE THINGS IN

02:49:04.701 --> 02:49:08.672 region:rollup2
THE PAST. ARE NOT NECESSARILY

02:49:06.737 --> 02:49:10.307 region:rollup2
THE RIGHT WAY TO DO THAT.

02:49:08.672 --> 02:49:12.075 region:rollup2
AYE AND YOU'RE ALWAYS THIS ARE

02:49:10.307 --> 02:49:13.610 region:rollup2
DEFINITELY VERY OPPOSED.

02:49:12.075 --> 02:49:14.645 region:rollup2
NO DOUBT ABOUT IT OUT BUT I

02:49:13.610 --> 02:49:15.912 region:rollup2
DON'T THINK THAT NECESSARILY

02:49:14.645 --> 02:49:17.180 region:rollup2
REFLUX

02:49:15.912 --> 02:49:19.416 region:rollup2
THE ENTIRE MEDICAL.

02:49:17.180 --> 02:49:21.018 region:rollup2
PROFESSION AND I WANT TO JUST

02:49:19.416 --> 02:49:21.318 region:rollup2
REALLY STRESS.

02:49:21.018 --> 02:49:23.620 region:rollup2
WHEN THE.

02:49:21.318 --> 02:49:24.688 region:rollup2
WHEN THE DOCTOR TALKED ABOUT

02:49:23.620 --> 02:49:25.689 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS IS NOT A SNOB

02:49:24.688 --> 02:49:27.858 region:rollup2
JUDGMENT IT'S NOT BROTHERS

02:49:25.689 --> 02:49:29.893 region:rollup2
WHISKEY. BABIES FROM THE

02:49:27.858 --> 02:49:31.895 region:rollup2
BIRTHING ROOM TO DO THE SURGERY.

02:49:29.893 --> 02:49:33.830 region:rollup2
AND THERE'S ALL THESE PEOPLE

02:49:31.895 --> 02:49:35.098 region:rollup2
INVOLVED THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE

02:49:33.830 --> 02:49:37.968 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN THIS DECISION.

02:49:35.098 --> 02:49:38.668 region:rollup2
BECAUSE ONE PERSON THAT WAS LEFT

02:49:37.968 --> 02:49:39.936 region:rollup2
OUT OF THAT DECISION.

02:49:38.668 --> 02:49:41.872 region:rollup2
A PERSON WHOSE LIFE WILL BE

02:49:39.936 --> 02:49:43.340 region:rollup2
PERMANENTLY IRREVERSIBLY

02:49:41.872 --> 02:49:45.208 region:rollup2
IMPACTED.

02:49:43.340 --> 02:49:47.110 region:rollup2
BY ABOUT SURGERY.

02:49:45.208 --> 02:49:50.080 region:rollup2
THAT BECAUSE A PERSON IS A BABY

02:49:47.110 --> 02:49:52.516 region:rollup2
OR AN INFANT AND IS A LEASE FOR

02:49:50.080 --> 02:49:53.216 region:rollup2
AWHILE MIGHT ABLE TO EXPRESS.

02:49:52.516 --> 02:49:55.252 region:rollup2
THEIR GENDER TAKES

02:49:53.216 --> 02:49:56.219 region:rollup2
TIME

02:49:55.252 --> 02:49:58.522 region:rollup2
THE CHILDREN TO BE ABLE TO DO

02:49:56.219 --> 02:49:59.423 region:rollup2
THAT. AND SO ALL OVER ASKING IS

02:49:58.522 --> 02:50:02.059 region:rollup2
FOR.

02:49:59.423 --> 02:50:04.795 region:rollup2
TO GIVE THAT SPACE

02:50:02.059 --> 02:50:06.496 region:rollup2
SO THAT THAT CHILD CAN MAKE A

02:50:04.795 --> 02:50:07.597 region:rollup2
DECISION FOR THEMSELVES. I

02:50:06.496 --> 02:50:09.800 region:rollup2
DIDN'T HAVE TO BE ONCE THEY TURN

02:50:07.597 --> 02:50:11.568 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN. WE KNOW THEIR CHILDREN

02:50:09.800 --> 02:50:14.137 region:rollup2

THEIR GENDER.

02:50:15.472 --> 02:50:19.376 region:rollup2
AND THEN THEIR PARENTS ARE

02:50:17.541 --> 02:50:20.577 region:rollup2
BEING RESPECTFUL AND WORKING

02:50:19.376 --> 02:50:22.712 region:rollup2
WITH THEM AND GIVING THEM THE

02:50:20.577 --> 02:50:25.148 region:rollup2
MEDICAL CARE. THEY NEED OR DON'T

02:50:22.712 --> 02:50:25.515 region:rollup2
AND NOT GIVING THE MEDICAL CARE

02:50:25.148 --> 02:50:28.485 region:rollup2
THEY DON'T NEED

02:50:25.515 --> 02:50:29.352 region:rollup2
US THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS.

02:50:28.485 --> 02:50:32.055 region:rollup2

02:54:03.700 --> 02:54:06.469 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS TO THIS RESOLUTION

02:54:05.502 --> 02:54:08.838 region:rollup2
TO OUR ATTENTION.

02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:11.374 region:rollup2
JUST TIME.

02:54:08.838 --> 02:54:13.376 region:rollup2
IN HEARING THE TESTIMONY.

02:54:11.374 --> 02:54:15.245 region:rollup2
THERE'S BEEN WORDS LIKE NORMAL

02:54:13.376 --> 02:54:17.881 region:rollup2
BEING USED.

02:54:15.245 --> 02:54:19.716 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S PROBLEMATIC.

02:54:17.881 --> 02:54:21.384 region:rollup2
THIS IS TWENTY EIGHTEEN.

02:54:19.716 --> 02:54:24.054 region:rollup2
AND WHAT WE CAN'T WHAT WE HAVE

02:54:21.384 --> 02:54:25.822 region:rollup2
CONSIDERED NORMAL IN THE PAST.

02:54:24.054 --> 02:54:27.290 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

02:54:25.822 --> 02:54:28.591 region:rollup2
WHAT'S BEING DESCRIBED TODAY IS

02:54:27.290 --> 02:54:30.260 region:rollup2
NOT THE APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE

02:54:28.591 --> 02:54:31.761 region:rollup2
THAT WE USE TO ADDRESS.

02:54:30.260 --> 02:54:34.164 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY THAT IS IN OUR SEX

02:54:31.761 --> 02:54:35.699 region:rollup2
OR THE LGBT COMMUNITY WHICH HAS.

02:54:34.164 --> 02:54:38.101 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUSLY FOUGHT FOR THEIR

02:54:35.699 --> 02:54:38.969 region:rollup2
VERY MERRICK'S THIS.

02:54:38.101 --> 02:54:40.537 region:rollup2
AND SO THIS AT THE END OF THE

02:54:38.969 --> 02:54:42.706 region:rollup2
DAY.

02:54:40.537 --> 02:54:43.807 region:rollup2
IS A CELEBRATION OF PEOPLE

02:54:42.706 --> 02:54:45.809 region:rollup2
IT'S A RESOLUTION TO CELEBRATE

02:54:43.807 --> 02:54:47.644 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT ARE INTERSEX.

02:54:45.809 --> 02:54:49.312 region:rollup2
AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE GIVEN THE

02:54:47.644 --> 02:54:50.714 region:rollup2
RIGHT TO LIVE YOUR LIFE THE WAY

02:54:49.312 --> 02:54:51.715 region:rollup2
YOU WANT TO LIVE YOUR LIFE AND

02:54:50.714 --> 02:54:52.615 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL OF

02:54:51.715 --> 02:54:55.151 region:rollup2
US TO BELIEVE THAT YOU ARE

02:54:52.615 --> 02:54:55.785 region:rollup2
ALREADY NORMAL TO.

02:54:55.151 --> 02:54:56.753 region:rollup2
THERE IS NOTHING THAT YOU NEED

02:54:55.785 --> 02:54:58.555 region:rollup2
TO CHANGE AND THERE IS NOTHING

02:54:56.753 --> 02:54:59.589 region:rollup2
THAT.

02:54:58.555 --> 02:55:00.990 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE CAN TELL YOU ABOUT

02:54:59.589 --> 02:55:03.026 region:rollup2
WHO YOU ARE.

02:55:00.990 --> 02:55:04.894 region:rollup2
AND IT'S CHALLENGING TWO PERCENT

02:55:03.026 --> 02:55:06.029 region:rollup2
AND SHARE YOUR STORY PEOPLE THAT

02:55:04.894 --> 02:55:07.764 region:rollup2
MAY NOT BE AS FAMILIAR.

02:55:06.029 --> 02:55:09.232 region:rollup2
WITH THE ISSUE

02:55:07.764 --> 02:55:11.101 region:rollup2
SO I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS

02:55:09.232 --> 02:55:13.003 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION AND I HOPE THAT MY

02:55:11.101 --> 02:55:14.637 region:rollup2
COLLEAGUES AND OTHERS CAN BEGIN

02:55:13.003 --> 02:55:16.139 region:rollup2
TO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A.

02:55:14.637 --> 02:55:18.108 region:rollup2
WHOLE OTHER WORLD IN

02:55:16.139 --> 02:55:19.175 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION ABOUT GENDER AND

02:55:18.108 --> 02:55:20.643 region:rollup2
SEXUALITY THAT IT'S MUCH MORE

02:55:19.175 --> 02:55:22.779 region:rollup2
FLUID.

02:55:20.643 --> 02:55:23.680 region:rollup2
THEN THE NORMAL CONVERSATION

02:55:22.779 --> 02:55:24.280 region:rollup2
THAT THAT HAS BEEN HAD IN THE

02:55:23.680 --> 02:55:28.518 region:rollup2
PAST

02:55:24.280 --> 02:55:29.986 region:rollup2
THANK YOU.

02:55:28.518 --> 02:55:31.154 region:rollup2
THE GIVES MR THIS AREA MY

APOLOGIES I SKIPPED ADDED ME TO

02:55:31.154 --> 02:55:33.556 region:rollup2
DO THAT BECAUSE I DON'T. THINK

02:55:32.555 --> 02:55:37.127 region:rollup2

SENATOR I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU

02:55:41.931 --> 02:55:44.567 region:rollup2
BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD

02:55:42.999 --> 02:55:45.935 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I'VE STRUGGLED WITH IT

02:55:44.567 --> 02:55:47.470 region:rollup2
AND AND USUALLY YOUR BILLS AND

02:55:45.935 --> 02:55:48.705 region:rollup2
THIS COMMITTEE I'M.

02:55:47.470 --> 02:55:51.374 region:rollup2
I'M ON BOARD.

02:55:48.705 --> 02:55:53.376 region:rollup2
THIS IS A RESOLUTION SALT

02:55:51.374 --> 02:55:55.278 region:rollup2
SUPPORTED TODAY BUT IT'S VERY

02:55:53.376 --> 02:55:57.013 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT TO.

02:55:55.278 --> 02:55:59.315 region:rollup2
TAKE SUCH AN ISSUE LIKE THIS

02:55:57.013 --> 02:56:01.151 region:rollup2
INTO HAND. WHEN THERE'S VERY

02:55:59.315 --> 02:56:03.019 region:rollup2
LITTLE DATA AVAILABLE.

02:56:01.151 --> 02:56:04.320 region:rollup2
AND I'VE CONTACT WE'VE.

02:56:03.019 --> 02:56:05.088 region:rollup2
I THINK AT THE STAFF LEVEL CUT

02:56:04.320 --> 02:56:06.556 region:rollup2
COMMUNICATED AND ASK FOR THE

02:56:05.088 --> 02:56:09.392 region:rollup2
DATA.

02:56:06.556 --> 02:56:11.528 region:rollup2
I TRY TO LOOK FOR IT IN OTHER

02:56:09.392 --> 02:56:13.129 region:rollup2
PLACES JUST NOW. FOR THE FIRST

02:56:11.528 --> 02:56:15.598 region:rollup2
TIME I HEARD FROM NOT MISTAKEN

02:56:13.129 --> 02:56:17.367 region:rollup2
NINE PERCENT OF SURGERIES FEW

02:56:15.598 --> 02:56:19.369 region:rollup2
ONE ELABORATE ON THAT IT BE

02:56:17.367 --> 02:56:20.937 region:rollup2
INTERESTED BUT BEFORE YOU DO.

02:56:19.369 --> 02:56:22.806 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE WAS.

02:56:20.937 --> 02:56:23.373 region:rollup2
IF IF IF THIS HAD. IF THIS BILL

02:56:22.806 --> 02:56:26.009 region:rollup2
HAD BEEN ADVANCED IN NEVADA

02:56:23.373 --> 02:56:28.244 region:rollup2
WHAT.

02:56:26.009 --> 02:56:29.312 region:rollup2
DATA WAS USED THEIR TO ADVANCE

02:56:28.244 --> 02:56:31.147 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE.

02:56:29.312 --> 02:56:32.549 region:rollup2
I AND I.

02:56:31.147 --> 02:56:34.717 region:rollup2
I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE AND

02:56:32.549 --> 02:56:35.718 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

02:56:34.717 --> 02:56:36.686 region:rollup2
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MOVE

02:56:35.718 --> 02:56:40.957 region:rollup2
FORWARD?

02:56:36.686 --> 02:56:42.092 region:rollup2
?

02:56:40.957 --> 02:56:43.560 region:rollup2
GIVEN THE SENSITIVITIES OF THE

02:56:42.092 --> 02:56:44.160 region:rollup2
ISSUE THERE MAY BE PLACES IN

02:56:43.560 --> 02:56:44.327 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T ADDRESS

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:46.563 region:rollup2
THIS

02:56:44.327 --> 02:56:48.731 region:rollup2
ISSUE WITH.

02:56:46.563 --> 02:56:49.332 region:rollup2
THE CARE AND THOUGHTFULNESS AND.

02:56:48.731 --> 02:56:49.833 region:rollup2
MAYBE THE UNIFORMITY THAT IT

02:56:49.332 --> 02:56:51.968 region:rollup2
NEEDS

02:56:49.833 --> 02:56:53.103 region:rollup2
SO.

02:56:51.968 --> 02:56:54.871 region:rollup2
THERE NEEDS TO BE GREATER

02:56:53.103 --> 02:56:55.772 region:rollup2
AWARENESS THROUGH THIS MEASURE I

02:56:54.871 --> 02:56:57.707 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THAT AND APPRECIATE

02:56:55.772 --> 02:56:59.976 region:rollup2
THAT HARD VERY MUCH BUT.

02:56:57.707 --> 02:57:00.443 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU GET INTO THE SCIENCE

02:56:59.976 --> 02:57:02.011 region:rollup2
PORTION OF IT I'M JUST

02:57:00.443 --> 02:57:04.414 region:rollup2
WONDERING.

02:57:02.011 --> 02:57:06.149 region:rollup2
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH DATA TO BE.

02:57:04.414 --> 02:57:08.651 region:rollup2
.

02:57:06.149 --> 02:57:10.620 region:rollup2
REALLY UPHOLDING THIS SO IF THIS

02:57:08.651 --> 02:57:11.221 region:rollup2
WAS A BILL I'D BE STRUGGLING I

02:57:10.620 --> 02:57:12.322 region:rollup2
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT

02:57:11.221 --> 02:57:14.090 region:rollup2
TODAY.

02:57:12.322 --> 02:57:15.658 region:rollup2
SO IF THERE IS SOME DATA THAT

02:57:14.090 --> 02:57:17.293 region:rollup2
YOU CAN SHED SOME LIGHT ON AND

02:57:15.658 --> 02:57:18.661 region:rollup2
OFF FOR A I'D. LIKE TO HEAR FROM

02:57:17.293 --> 02:57:21.097 region:rollup2
BOTH SIDES.

02:57:18.661 --> 02:57:22.932 region:rollup2
CAN I SPEAK TO THAT.

02:57:21.097 --> 02:57:24.767 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW OH WHEREIN I BOTH SPOKE

02:57:22.932 --> 02:57:26.002 region:rollup2
TO THE CENSUS GO A HUMAN RIGHTS

02:57:24.767 --> 02:57:26.736 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE BACK IN.

02:57:26.002 --> 02:57:28.938 region:rollup2
AS THE NINETIES EARLY TWO

02:57:26.736 --> 02:57:29.906 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS.

02:57:28.938 --> 02:57:31.708 region:rollup2
AND WE BOTH ARE SAYING THE SAME

02:57:29.906 --> 02:57:32.976 region:rollup2
THING AT THAT POINT.

02:57:31.708 --> 02:57:34.777 region:rollup2
BUT THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS NOW

02:57:32.976 --> 02:57:36.880 region:rollup2
IT WAS TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND THERE

02:57:34.777 --> 02:57:38.915 region:rollup2
STILL IS NO EVIDENCE THAT THE

02:57:36.880 --> 02:57:40.984 region:rollup2
SURGERIES ACTUALLY. HAVE ANY

02:57:38.915 --> 02:57:42.519 region:rollup2
GOOD OUTCOMES AND THERE'S PLENTY

02:57:40.984 --> 02:57:43.786 region:rollup2
OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY HAVE VERY

02:57:42.519 --> 02:57:45.155 region:rollup2
BAD OUTCOMES AND CATASTROPHIC

02:57:43.786 --> 02:57:47.056 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES.

02:57:45.155 --> 02:57:48.791 region:rollup2
REFER YOU TO THE LETTER THAT WAS

02:57:47.056 --> 02:57:50.426 region:rollup2
SENT TO ALL OF YOU FROM A DOCTOR

02:57:48.791 --> 02:57:51.628 region:rollup2
EILEEN WONKY SUMMARIZES

02:57:50.426 --> 02:57:53.129 region:rollup2
A LOT OF.

02:57:51.628 --> 02:57:55.365 region:rollup2
LARRY'S POINTS ABOUT.

02:57:53.129 --> 02:57:57.233 region:rollup2
WHAT SURGERIES HE'S DOING AND

02:57:55.365 --> 02:57:59.102 region:rollup2
WHAT THE PERCENTAGES ARE?

02:57:57.233 --> 02:57:59.869 region:rollup2
I ALSO LIKE TO MENTION TO YOU

02:57:59.102 --> 02:58:01.004 region:rollup2
THAT THE WORLD HEALTH

02:57:59.869 --> 02:58:02.739 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATION DOES FUNNY

02:58:01.004 --> 02:58:05.141 region:rollup2
SURGERIES TO BE AGAINST WHAT

02:58:02.739 --> 02:58:05.742 region:rollup2
THEY CONSIDER PERSONAL AUTONOMY.

02:58:05.141 --> 02:58:06.376 region:rollup2
AND THEIR DANCING SURGERIES AS

02:58:05.742 --> 02:58:09.078 region:rollup2
WELL.

02:58:06.376 --> 02:58:10.880 region:rollup2
THINKING.

02:58:09.078 --> 02:58:11.748 region:rollup2
SO TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION.

02:58:10.880 --> 02:58:13.616 region:rollup2
ALTHOUGH THIS IS JUST A

02:58:11.748 --> 02:58:15.451 region:rollup2
RESOLUTION THE WHEREAS IS THAT

02:58:13.616 --> 02:58:16.986 region:rollup2
IT IS BASED UPON GROSSLY

02:58:15.451 --> 02:58:18.354 region:rollup2
MISREPRESENT THE SCIENCE AND THE

02:58:16.986 --> 02:58:20.123 region:rollup2
FACTS.

02:58:18.354 --> 02:58:22.158 region:rollup2
SO EVEN THOUGH THE INTENTIONS

02:58:20.123 --> 02:58:23.993 region:rollup2
ARE GOOD. TO COME OUT OF THE

02:58:22.158 --> 02:58:26.629 region:rollup2
GATE. WITH A FOUNDATION FOR

02:58:23.993 --> 02:58:27.597 region:rollup2
POSSIBLE LEGISLATION THE FUTURE

02:58:26.629 --> 02:58:30.133 region:rollup2
BASED ON SO MANY GROSS

02:58:27.597 --> 02:58:32.168 region:rollup2
MISREPRESENTATIONS AND.

02:58:30.133 --> 02:58:34.203 region:rollup2
INCORRECT STATEMENTS I THINK

02:58:32.168 --> 02:58:35.872 region:rollup2
WOULD BE HARMFUL TO. WHAT COULD

02:58:34.203 --> 02:58:37.240 region:rollup2
OTHERWISE BE A VERY UPLIFTING

02:58:35.872 --> 02:58:39.008 region:rollup2
AND AND HELPFUL CONVERSATION IN

02:58:37.240 --> 02:58:40.310 region:rollup2
THE FUTURE?

02:58:39.008 --> 02:58:42.845 region:rollup2
OF THE PATIENTS TO UNDERGO

02:58:40.310 --> 02:58:43.913 region:rollup2
SURGERY NINETY PERCENT OF THEM

02:58:42.845 --> 02:58:45.882 region:rollup2
ARE CONGENITAL ADRENAL

02:58:43.913 --> 02:58:47.550 region:rollup2
HYPERPLASIA PATIENTS WHICH ARE

02:58:45.882 --> 02:58:49.953 region:rollup2
GIRLS WHOSE GENDER IDENTITY IS

02:58:47.550 --> 02:58:52.755 region:rollup2
FEMALE. BUT HIS GENITALS ARE

02:58:49.953 --> 02:58:54.857 region:rollup2
OVER STIMULATED BY TESTOSTERONE

02:58:52.755 --> 02:58:58.127 region:rollup2
AND LOOK LIKE MALE GENITALS.

02:58:54.857 --> 02:58:59.462 region:rollup2
THESE GIRLS ARE NOT FORCED TO.

02:58:58.127 --> 02:59:01.230 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIES GROWTH BY THE

02:58:59.462 --> 02:59:02.966 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY OR THEIR SOCIETY THIS

02:59:01.230 --> 02:59:04.734 region:rollup2
IS THEIR BRAIN SEX THIS IS THEIR

02:59:02.966 --> 02:59:06.669 region:rollup2
GENDER IDENTITY. AND IT'S A

02:59:04.734 --> 02:59:08.438 region:rollup2
MATTER OF WHEN THEY'RE ALLOWED

02:59:06.669 --> 02:59:09.472 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THAT AFFIRMING SURGERY

02:59:08.438 --> 02:59:10.473 region:rollup2
WE'VE BECOME MUCH MORE

02:59:09.472 --> 02:59:12.242 region:rollup2
ENLIGHTENED IN ALLOWING PEOPLE

02:59:10.473 --> 02:59:13.610 region:rollup2
WITH GENDER DYSPHORIA TO HAVE

02:59:12.242 --> 02:59:15.345 region:rollup2
GENDER AFFIRMING SURGERY AT

02:59:13.610 --> 02:59:16.546 region:rollup2
YOUNGER AND YOUNGER AGES.

02:59:15.345 --> 02:59:18.247 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOW MOVING PAST ADULTHOOD

02:59:16.546 --> 02:59:20.116 region:rollup2
AND ADOLESCENCE AND EVEN PRE

02:59:18.247 --> 02:59:21.417 region:rollup2
ADOLESCENTS ALLOWING. THESE

02:59:20.116 --> 02:59:22.452 region:rollup2
PEOPLE TO TRANSITION WITH

02:59:21.417 --> 02:59:24.287 region:rollup2
HORMONAL THERAPY AND THEN

02:59:22.452 --> 02:59:25.922 region:rollup2
EVENTUALLY SURGERY WHY WOULD WE

02:59:24.287 --> 02:59:27.890 region:rollup2
DO THE EXACT OPPOSITE WITH THIS

02:59:25.922 --> 02:59:28.825 region:rollup2
POPULATION OF GIRLS AND PREVENT

02:59:27.890 --> 02:59:30.260 region:rollup2
THEM FROM AFFIRMING THEIR

02:59:28.825 --> 02:59:32.195 region:rollup2
CHATTER. UNTIL THEY'RE AT OLDER

02:59:30.260 --> 02:59:34.163 region:rollup2
AGES BECAUSE WHO KNOWS WHAT THE

02:59:32.195 --> 02:59:35.865 region:rollup2
AGE. THE LOWER LIMIT AT THE AGE

02:59:34.163 --> 02:59:38.668 region:rollup2
OF OUR ABILITY WILL BE AND WHO

02:59:35.865 --> 02:59:40.203 region:rollup2
KNOWS WHEN ONE'S IDENTIFICATION

02:59:38.668 --> 02:59:42.138 region:rollup2
OF THEIR GENITALIA STARTS TO.

02:59:40.203 --> 02:59:44.140 region:rollup2
RATIFY WITH THEIR SELF

02:59:42.138 --> 02:59:44.807 region:rollup2
IDENTIFICATION IN THE OTHER WAYS

02:59:44.140 --> 02:59:46.142 region:rollup2
IN WHICH THEY PERCEIVE THE WORLD

02:59:44.807 --> 02:59:48.511 region:rollup2
AROUND THEM. WHEN IS THE

02:59:46.142 --> 02:59:51.414 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE AGE TO FINALLY ALLOW

02:59:48.511 --> 02:59:52.982 region:rollup2
THESE INDIVIDUALS TO HAVE ACCESS

02:59:51.414 --> 02:59:54.250 region:rollup2
TO THEIR IDENTITY AND AGAIN IT'S

02:59:52.982 --> 02:59:55.818 region:rollup2
NINETY PERCENT OF THE PATIENTS

02:59:54.250 --> 02:59:59.555 region:rollup2
WHO UNDERGO SURGERY OR CAN THIS

02:59:55.818 --> 03:00:00.123 region:rollup2
CATEGORIZATION.

02:59:59.555 --> 03:00:01.791 region:rollup2
I'D I JUST WOULD LIKE TO ADD

03:00:00.123 --> 03:00:03.359 region:rollup2
THAT.

03:00:01.791 --> 03:00:03.860 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU LOOK THROUGH POP BETTER

03:00:03.359 --> 03:00:07.063 region:rollup2
THE SCIENTIFIC MEDICAL.

03:00:03.860 --> 03:00:08.531 region:rollup2
DATABASE.

03:00:07.063 --> 03:00:10.566 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STUDIES

03:00:08.531 --> 03:00:12.568 region:rollup2
WERE WOMEN WHO HAVE CONGENITAL

03:00:10.566 --> 03:00:14.103 region:rollup2
HYPERPLASIA.

03:00:12.568 --> 03:00:16.806 region:rollup2
A FORM OF DST WHICH THEY DON'T

03:00:14.103 --> 03:00:17.507 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGE.

03:00:16.806 --> 03:00:18.775 region:rollup2
YEAH BECAUSE THEY REFERRED US TO

03:00:17.507 --> 03:00:20.610 region:rollup2
BE CALL NORMAL PEOPLE WHICH THEY

03:00:18.775 --> 03:00:22.311 region:rollup2
ARE. ARE HAPPY WITH THEIR

03:00:20.610 --> 03:00:23.880 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES WHEN THEY HAD SURGERY

03:00:22.311 --> 03:00:25.481 region:rollup2
OF CHILDHOOD AND MORE AND WHEN

03:00:23.880 --> 03:00:27.583 region:rollup2
ASKED WHETHER THEY WOULD PREFER

03:00:25.481 --> 03:00:29.852 region:rollup2
TO HAVE THE SURGERY.

03:00:27.583 --> 03:00:31.921 region:rollup2
IF THEY. WEREN'T GIVEN THE

03:00:29.852 --> 03:00:33.122 region:rollup2
SURGERY THEY DEFINITELY HAVE

03:00:31.921 --> 03:00:35.391 region:rollup2
PREFERRED TO HAVE THE SURGERY AS

03:00:33.122 --> 03:00:37.093 region:rollup2
BABIES.

03:00:35.391 --> 03:00:39.062 region:rollup2
SO OF THE OUTCOMES THERE THE

03:00:37.093 --> 03:00:40.363 region:rollup2
LETTER SHE WAS THERE. IN THIS

03:00:39.062 --> 03:00:42.598 region:rollup2
GROUP OF PATIENTS WE HAVE

03:00:40.363 --> 03:00:44.400 region:rollup2
EXCELLENT LONG TERM DATA IN SOME

03:00:42.598 --> 03:00:46.135 region:rollup2
OF THE OTHER REFER PATIENTS.

03:00:44.400 --> 03:00:48.171 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WERE GATHERING BUT THIS

03:00:46.135 --> 03:00:51.841 region:rollup2
IS THE. PATIENT GROUP THAT WE

03:00:48.171 --> 03:00:52.842 region:rollup2
SEE MOST OFTEN.

03:00:51.841 --> 03:00:54.811 region:rollup2
SHERIFF YOU KNOW I JUST HAVE

03:00:52.842 --> 03:00:56.345 region:rollup2
BEEN FOLLOWED BY A. I'M MISSING

03:00:54.811 --> 03:00:57.180 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SO IT SAYS BETWEEN.

03:00:56.345 --> 03:00:59.182 region:rollup2
ONE TO TWO PERCENT OF

03:00:57.180 --> 03:01:01.117 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE BORN WITH

03:00:59.182 --> 03:01:03.386 region:rollup2
VARIATIONS IN THEIR PHYSICAL.

03:01:01.117 --> 03:01:05.088 region:rollup2
SEX CHARACTERISTICS.

03:01:03.386 --> 03:01:06.055 region:rollup2
OF THE ONE TO TWO PERCENT WHAT

03:01:05.088 --> 03:01:07.990 region:rollup2
PERCENTAGE AND GOING THROUGH

03:01:06.055 --> 03:01:10.126 region:rollup2
SURGERY.

03:01:07.990 --> 03:01:11.661 region:rollup2
AND.

03:01:10.126 --> 03:01:12.595 region:rollup2
LEAVE MY ESTIMATE BECAUSE THAT'S

03:01:11.661 --> 03:01:14.497 region:rollup2
WHAT'S IN THE RESOLUTION AS IT

03:01:12.595 --> 03:01:15.832 region:rollup2
SPITS WAY LESS THAN ONE PERCENT

03:01:14.497 --> 03:01:17.500 region:rollup2
ARE BORN WITH A TYPICAL

03:01:15.832 --> 03:01:18.167 region:rollup2
GENITALIA.

03:01:17.500 --> 03:01:19.369 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S A

03:01:18.167 --> 03:01:21.003 region:rollup2
MISREPRESENTATION OF THE ACTUAL

03:01:19.369 --> 03:01:22.505 region:rollup2
FACTS.

03:01:21.003 --> 03:01:25.308 region:rollup2
THE NUMBER OF SURGERIES ARE DONE

03:01:22.505 --> 03:01:26.809 region:rollup2
IN THIS COUNTRY. IN MY OPINION

03:01:25.308 --> 03:01:28.144 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED

03:01:26.809 --> 03:01:30.146 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY CONTROVERSIAL OR

03:01:28.144 --> 03:01:35.918 region:rollup2
LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED.

03:01:30.146 --> 03:01:38.588 region:rollup2
IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY.

03:01:35.918 --> 03:01:40.523 region:rollup2
SPUR.

03:01:38.588 --> 03:01:42.558 region:rollup2
I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY BECAUSE I

03:01:40.523 --> 03:01:44.927 region:rollup2
KNOW YOU AND I DON'T I'M.

03:01:42.558 --> 03:01:47.830 region:rollup2

03:01:44.927 --> 03:01:50.266 region:rollup2
DIFFICULT FOR INFANTS WHO ARE

03:01:47.830 --> 03:01:53.035 region:rollup2
GENETICALLY FEMALE. WHO ARE JUST

03:01:50.266 --> 03:01:54.370 region:rollup2
HAVING A EUROPE UROLOGICAL ISSUE

03:01:53.035 --> 03:01:55.872 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO GET CORRECTIVE

03:01:54.370 --> 03:01:56.806 region:rollup2
SURGERY IS THAT YOUR AND TEN OR

03:01:55.872 --> 03:01:58.875 region:rollup2

HER PARENTS HAD IS NOT TO.

03:02:03.346 --> 03:02:07.083 region:rollup2
FOR ONCE SURGERY IS MEDICALLY

03:02:04.947 --> 03:02:07.483 region:rollup2
UNNECESSARY.

03:02:07.083 --> 03:02:13.689 region:rollup2
TO.

03:02:07.483 --> 03:02:14.857 region:rollup2
TO TO THE FOR SO.

03:02:13.689 --> 03:02:15.992 region:rollup2
ALWAYS GONNA BE A SPECTRUM RAIN

03:02:14.857 --> 03:02:17.293 region:rollup2
AND I DON'T THINK IT'S SECURE

03:02:15.992 --> 03:02:18.461 region:rollup2
SOLVING ANYONE.

03:02:17.293 --> 03:02:19.262 region:rollup2
IT'S GOING TO SAY THAT IF YOU

03:02:19.262 --> 03:02:22.298 region:rollup2
IT FOR IF WE LOOK AT ONE END OF

03:02:20.463 --> 03:02:24.367 region:rollup2
THE SPECTRUM A MINOR.

03:02:22.298 --> 03:02:25.902 region:rollup2

THE ASSIGNMENT. AGENDA PHYSICAL

03:02:36.445 --> 03:02:38.247 region:rollup2
