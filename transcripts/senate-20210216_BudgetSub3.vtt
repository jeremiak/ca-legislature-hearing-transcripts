00:06:56.082 --> 00:06:58.184
HEARINGS AND LEGISLATIVELY

00:06:58.251 --> 00:07:00.586
DRIVEN WORK GROUPS THAT COULD

00:07:00.653 --> 00:07:02.455
BOTH FURTHER INFORMED THE STATE

00:07:02.522 --> 00:07:05.291
APPROACH IN IMPLEMENTING AND

00:07:05.358 --> 00:07:08.094
MAKING CHANGES- TO ALIGN WITH

00:07:08.161 --> 00:07:10.396
THE FEDERAL FINALRULE. OR TO

00:07:10.463 --> 00:07:11.464
JUST DISCUSS POSSIBLE

00:07:11.531 --> 00:07:13.299
IMPROVEMENTS TO THE PROGRAM AS

00:07:13.366 --> 00:07:16.169
A WHOLE I'M AND AN EXAMPLE WAS

00:07:16.235 --> 00:07:18.638
PROVIDED TO IT- IN YOUR GENDER

00:07:18.704 --> 00:07:20.673
IN THAT- THERE HAVE BEEN PAST

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.841
CONSIDERATIONS BY THE

00:07:21.908 --> 00:07:24.443
LEGISLATURE I'M TO SEASON FORCE

00:07:24.510 --> 00:07:26.379
MEN ON CHILD SUPPORT DEBT OWED

00:07:26.445 --> 00:07:27.780
TO THE STATE THAT IS DEEMED

00:07:27.847 --> 00:07:30.449
UNCOLLECTIBLE. AND THUS IS NOT

00:07:30.516 --> 00:07:32.585
AN EFFECTIVE OR PRODUCTIVE USE

00:07:32.652 --> 00:07:34.720
OF PROGRAM RESOURCES IF THE

00:07:34.787 --> 00:07:37.390
LEGISLATURE STILL INTERESTED IN

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:39.625
PURSUING THAT SPECIFIC-

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:41.594
OPERATIONAL CHANGE AND ITS

00:07:41.661 --> 00:07:44.197
ATTEMPTS TO MANAGE AND REDUCE

00:07:44.263 --> 00:07:46.299
CHILD SUPPORT DEBT. I'M BECOME

00:07:46.365 --> 00:07:49.502
CONSIDER INCLUDING THAT- AN

00:07:49.569 --> 00:07:51.270
ASSESSMENT ABOUT PARTICULAR

00:07:51.337 --> 00:07:54.006
CHANGE WITHIN THE RESEARCH

00:07:54.073 --> 00:07:55.107
PROPOSAL WITH THAT SAID WILL

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:56.275
CONTINUE TO ASSESS THE

00:07:56.342 --> 00:07:57.710
ADMINISTRATION'S FOR ALL AND

00:07:57.777 --> 00:07:58.711
WILL SHARE ANY ADDITIONAL

00:07:58.778 --> 00:08:00.279
COMMENTS WE HAVE WITH THE

00:08:00.346 --> 00:08:01.881
COMMITTEE AND STAFF THANK YOU

00:08:01.948 --> 00:08:04.116
THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IF I CAN

00:08:04.183 --> 00:08:06.319
ASK BACK TO THE DEPARTMENT. IN

00:08:06.385 --> 00:08:07.420
THIS I'M NEW TO THIS SO VERY

00:08:07.486 --> 00:08:12.525
BRIEFLY CAN YOU SPELL.

00:08:12.592 --> 00:08:14.293
EXPLAINED TO ME THE K. FACTOR.

00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:15.928
ON THE LINE IS KRISTIN DONNELLY

00:08:15.995 --> 00:08:17.096
CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR THAT CAN

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.264
GO INTO THAT DETAIL OF THE MORE

00:08:18.331 --> 00:08:21.934
CLEARLY. SURE JOHNSON IS BASS

00:08:22.001 --> 00:08:23.970
ON A MATHEMATICAL. AND THE KEY

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:26.372
FACTOR IS A COMPONENT TO THE

00:08:26.439 --> 00:08:28.407
PERCENTAGE OF A PARENT'S INCOME

00:08:28.474 --> 00:08:29.609
THAT IS UTILIZED FOR CHILD

00:08:29.675 --> 00:08:31.577
SUPPORT. SO THE CURRENT K.

00:08:31.644 --> 00:08:33.813
FACTOR IS ZERO POINT TWO FIVE

00:08:33.880 --> 00:08:35.915
OR 25% AS A BASE OR AS AN

00:08:35.982 --> 00:08:37.917
ANCHOR AND SO THAT MEANS WITHIN

00:08:37.984 --> 00:08:39.685
CERTAIN BANDS OF INCOME FOR

00:08:39.752 --> 00:08:41.020
FAMILIES AND IT'S COMBINED

00:08:41.087 --> 00:08:42.722
HOUSEHOLD INCOME. WE ASSUME

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:44.490
THAT FOR ONE CHILD WE'RE GOING

00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:47.593
TO ASSIGN 25% OF THE PARENTS

00:08:47.660 --> 00:08:48.094
INCOME TO SUPPORT THEIR

00:08:48.160 --> 00:08:50.329
CHILDREN. OKAY THE LAST REPORT

00:08:50.396 --> 00:08:51.330
HAD RECOMMENDED FURTHER

00:08:51.397 --> 00:08:53.466
RESEARCH ON THE K. FACTOR AS IT

00:08:53.532 --> 00:08:55.134
HAS NOT BEEN UPDATED AND THE

00:08:55.201 --> 00:08:56.435
BANDS OF INCOME HAVE NOT BEEN

00:08:56.502 --> 00:08:58.271
UPDATED SINCE IT WAS PUT INTO

00:08:58.337 --> 00:08:59.906
PLACE IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE.

00:08:59.972 --> 00:09:02.041
SO WILL WILL THAT BE PART OF

00:09:02.108 --> 00:09:03.743
THE STUDY THEN IS TAKING A LOOK

00:09:03.809 --> 00:09:04.710
AT THE KEY FACTOR IN SEEING IF

00:09:04.777 --> 00:09:05.878
IT'S STILL ACCURATE AND

00:09:05.945 --> 00:09:07.179
RELEVANT AND THEN HOW DOES THAT

00:09:07.246 --> 00:09:09.115
HOW WE- HOW WE USE THOSE TWO

00:09:09.181 --> 00:09:11.450
DATA POINTS. THE C. O. A. P.

00:09:11.517 --> 00:09:13.552
THE KEY FACTOR- TO REACH A

00:09:13.619 --> 00:09:15.254
CONCLUSION JOURNAL WE HAVE ANY

00:09:15.321 --> 00:09:16.956
OTHER DATA POINTS OR ANY OTHER.

00:09:17.023 --> 00:09:19.358
METHODOLOGY THAT WILL BE IN AND

00:09:19.425 --> 00:09:20.726
INTEGRATING INTO THAT. YES

00:09:20.793 --> 00:09:21.594
THERE COUPLE DIFFERENT RESEARCH

00:09:21.661 --> 00:09:23.596
METHODOLOGIES- ALREADY IN

00:09:23.663 --> 00:09:26.232
PLACE. THAT NEED TO BE UPDATED

00:09:26.299 --> 00:09:27.967
SO THAT TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT

00:09:28.034 --> 00:09:30.303
WHICH WAS PRODUCED- BY JUDICIAL

00:09:30.369 --> 00:09:32.672
COUNCIL CALIFORNIA AND- GIVEN

00:09:32.738 --> 00:09:34.006
TO THE LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY

00:09:34.073 --> 00:09:35.174
TWENTY EIGHTEEN. DID RECOMMEND

00:09:35.241 --> 00:09:36.676
FURTHER RESEARCH ON THAT K.

00:09:36.742 --> 00:09:39.312
FACTOR- WE DO WANT TO TAKE A

00:09:39.378 --> 00:09:41.047
LOOK MORE BROADLY. AND

00:09:41.113 --> 00:09:43.516
GENERALLY THE IDEA IS THAT IF

00:09:43.582 --> 00:09:45.518
WE HAVE AN ORDER THAT IS TOO

00:09:45.584 --> 00:09:47.820
HIGH AS NAN SAID THEN WE COULD

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.455
LEAD TO ARREARS. SO THERE'S

00:09:49.522 --> 00:09:50.990
THAT TIPPING POINT FOR PARENTS

00:09:51.057 --> 00:09:52.458
OF WHERE IT BECOMES TOO MUCH

00:09:52.525 --> 00:09:54.460
AND NEITHER PARENT CAN SURVIVE.

00:09:54.527 --> 00:09:56.562
SO IT IS ALSO INTERCONNECTED IN

00:09:56.629 --> 00:09:57.863
TERMS OF DETERMINING THE

00:09:57.930 --> 00:09:59.031
SUBSISTENCE LEVEL FOR THE

00:09:59.098 --> 00:10:00.399
PARENT WHO'S PAYING SUPPORT AS

00:10:00.466 --> 00:10:03.102
WELL. THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS

00:10:03.169 --> 00:10:04.503
IN THE PROCESS OF KICKING OFF

00:10:04.570 --> 00:10:06.272
THEIR QUADRENNIAL REVIEWS EVERY

00:10:06.339 --> 00:10:07.506
FOUR YEARS REQUIRED TO DO A

00:10:07.573 --> 00:10:09.275
REVIEW. SO THEY WILL GET AGAIN

00:10:09.342 --> 00:10:11.110
BE LOOKING AT AND THE RESEARCH

00:10:11.177 --> 00:10:12.078
THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE AND

00:10:12.144 --> 00:10:13.346
WHETHER ANYTHING NEW HAS TAKEN

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:15.214
PLACE SINCE THAT LAST REVIEW

00:10:15.281 --> 00:10:17.583
AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN. SO WHAT

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:19.285
WE'RE PREPARING FOR IS THE

00:10:19.352 --> 00:10:20.486
BELIEF THAT THEY WERE ASKED TO

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.888
DO FURTHER RESEARCH ON THIS AND

00:10:22.955 --> 00:10:24.323
SO WE CAN PARTNER WITH THEM TO

00:10:24.390 --> 00:10:26.359
DO THAT TOGETHER. SO WILL THERE

00:10:26.425 --> 00:10:28.060
BE ANY WHAT WHEN THEY JUST COME

00:10:28.127 --> 00:10:29.729
OUT WITH THEIR THEIR PATERNAL

00:10:29.795 --> 00:10:32.732
REVIEW. HOW HOW. WOULD YOU

00:10:32.798 --> 00:10:33.532
PROPOSE AND THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:10:33.599 --> 00:10:34.600
DIFFERENT FROM WHAT'S ALREADY

00:10:34.667 --> 00:10:35.568
BEEN DONE SO WE'RE NOT

00:10:35.634 --> 00:10:36.869
REDUNDANT AND- DOING THE WORK

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:37.937
DISCARDED INTO BY ANOTHER

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:40.072
AGENCY. ABSOLUTELY THAT'S A

00:10:40.139 --> 00:10:41.407
HUGE GOAL FOR US WE DON'T WANT

00:10:41.474 --> 00:10:42.274
TO BE WERE DONE IN THIS

00:10:42.341 --> 00:10:44.110
RESEARCH SO. THAT QUADRENNIAL

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.245
REVIEW AND THE SCOPE OF THAT IS

00:10:46.312 --> 00:10:47.580
NOT LARGE ENOUGH TO DO ANY

00:10:47.646 --> 00:10:49.148
ORIGINAL RESEARCH WHICH IS WHAT

00:10:49.215 --> 00:10:50.683
WE'RE LOOKING TO DO HERE TO GET

00:10:50.750 --> 00:10:52.451
A BETTER IDEA FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:10:52.518 --> 00:10:54.587
THE REPORT FROM TWENTY

00:10:54.653 --> 00:10:55.454
SEVENTEEN TALKS ABOUT THE FACT

00:10:55.521 --> 00:10:57.390
THAT CALIFORNIA SO UNIQUE. AND

00:10:57.456 --> 00:10:59.358
THAT IT IS THE DIFFERENCE- IN

00:10:59.425 --> 00:11:00.426
ALL THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:02.328
STATE WHERE HUGE STATE AND-

00:11:02.395 --> 00:11:03.562
IT'S VERY VERY DIFFERENT SO

00:11:03.629 --> 00:11:05.264
IT'S VERY DIVERSE. WE WANT TO

00:11:05.331 --> 00:11:06.399
MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

00:11:06.465 --> 00:11:07.266
APPROPRIATE RESEARCH TO

00:11:07.333 --> 00:11:09.735
UNDERSTAND- F WE DO NEED TO

00:11:09.802 --> 00:11:10.369
HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S A LITTLE

00:11:10.436 --> 00:11:11.837
MORE CUSTOMIZABLE. AND IF WE

00:11:11.904 --> 00:11:14.673
CAN DO THAT. MAKE IT UP THAT

00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:16.075
WOULD NOT BE REDUNDANT THE

00:11:16.142 --> 00:11:17.376
ACCORD JOINING REVIEW WOULD SAY

00:11:17.443 --> 00:11:21.647
HERE'S THE RESEARCH. THAT'S IN

00:11:21.714 --> 00:11:22.248
TOTAL AND WE RECOMMEND YOU DO

00:11:22.314 --> 00:11:23.949
FOR RESEARCH ON THIS IS. SO

00:11:24.016 --> 00:11:24.850
YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE GOING TO

00:11:24.917 --> 00:11:27.486
FOCUS ON. THE FURTHER RESEARCH

00:11:27.553 --> 00:11:29.422
NEEDED TO GONNA TAKE DIRECTION

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:31.023
FROM THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL

00:11:31.090 --> 00:11:32.992
REPORT WELL SO THAT REPORT IS

00:11:33.059 --> 00:11:34.260
DUE TO JUDICIAL COUNCIL IN

00:11:34.326 --> 00:11:35.761
NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND IT

00:11:35.828 --> 00:11:36.662
WILL COME TO GO TO THE

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:39.398
LEGISLATURE IN JANUARY OF

00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:39.999
TWENTY TWENTY TWO SO WE WOULD

00:11:40.066 --> 00:11:42.134
ANTICIPATE BEING ABLE TO START

00:11:42.201 --> 00:11:43.502
OUR RESEARCH AFTER WE KNOW

00:11:43.569 --> 00:11:45.604
FINALLY WHAT THEIR REVIEW THAT

00:11:45.671 --> 00:11:47.006
COMES STEVEN JERRY TWENTY

00:11:47.073 --> 00:11:48.140
TWENTY TWO. AND WHAT ARE THE

00:11:48.207 --> 00:11:49.141
THINGS THAT THEY RECOMMEND THAT

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:51.877
WE RESEARCH FURTHER IN TWENTY

00:11:51.944 --> 00:11:52.445
EIGHTEEN THEY DID RECOMMEND

00:11:52.511 --> 00:11:53.379
FURTHER RESEARCH ON THE KEY

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:54.947
FACTOR AND THAT'S NOT BEEN DONE

00:11:55.014 --> 00:11:56.382
YET SO WE ANTICIPATE THAT THAT

00:11:56.449 --> 00:11:57.583
WILL BE IN THIS NEW REPORT AS

00:11:57.650 --> 00:11:59.318
WELL SO WE'RE NOT ANTICIPATING

00:11:59.385 --> 00:12:00.953
EVEN GETTING GOING ON THIS

00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:01.487
UNTIL NEXT YEAR IS THAT

00:12:01.554 --> 00:12:03.456
CORRECT. FOR THE K. FACTOR

00:12:03.522 --> 00:12:04.857
PORTION YES WE WOULD LIKE TO

00:12:04.924 --> 00:12:06.025
START WITH THE COLLECTABILITY

00:12:06.092 --> 00:12:08.060
PORTION HERE WE DID ANTICIPATE

00:12:08.127 --> 00:12:09.328
THAT THIS RESEARCH WOULD NEED

00:12:09.395 --> 00:12:10.996
TO BE DONE OVER TWO YEAR

00:12:11.063 --> 00:12:12.398
PERIODS THAT'S WHY DOES HAVE

00:12:12.465 --> 00:12:14.700
THAT TWO FISCAL YEARS IN THIS

00:12:14.767 --> 00:12:19.638
PROPOSAL OKAY. AND THEN- LET'S

00:12:19.705 --> 00:12:23.909
FIND OUT WHAT THE BEST PLAN. I

00:12:23.976 --> 00:12:26.645
YOU THINK IT'S A VERY- SO

00:12:26.712 --> 00:12:29.014
BASICALLY PAY SOMEONE A- JERRY

00:12:29.081 --> 00:12:30.983
SAYING THAT FOR THIS COMING

00:12:31.050 --> 00:12:33.385
FISCAL YEAR THE PROPOSAL IS

00:12:33.452 --> 00:12:34.186
REALLY TO STUDY TO

00:12:34.253 --> 00:12:35.855
COLLECTABILITY ISSUES AND THEN

00:12:35.921 --> 00:12:37.756
AFTER JUDICIAL COUNCIL IS DONE

00:12:37.823 --> 00:12:39.225
THEIR REPORT THEN YOU'RE GONNA

00:12:39.291 --> 00:12:41.160
LOOK AT THE K. FACTOR IS SO IS

00:12:41.227 --> 00:12:42.561
THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL INCLUDES

00:12:42.628 --> 00:12:45.431
BOTH PARTS ARE IS IT JUST FOR

00:12:45.498 --> 00:12:47.399
THE FIRST PART. OF YOUR STUDY.

00:12:47.466 --> 00:12:48.434
IT'S FOR BOTH PARTS IN URBAN

00:12:48.501 --> 00:12:49.869
OKAY SO BOTH PARTS OKAY THANK

00:12:49.935 --> 00:12:51.537
YOU AND THEN WHAT IS YOUR

00:12:51.604 --> 00:12:53.038
LOOKING AT THE COLLECTABILITY

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:55.107
ISSUES SO FOR EXAMPLE- YEAH WE

00:12:55.174 --> 00:12:56.308
DID HAVE A BILL WHICH

00:12:56.375 --> 00:12:58.144
UNFORTUNATELY GOVERNOR VETOED.

00:12:58.210 --> 00:12:59.512
REGARDING INTERESTS I THINK BUT

00:12:59.578 --> 00:13:00.513
I REMEMBER WHEN THE BILL CAME

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:02.314
THROUGH HUMAN SERVICES ONE OF

00:13:02.381 --> 00:13:03.282
THE ISSUES THAT WE TALKED ABOUT

00:13:03.349 --> 00:13:07.353
IS THAT SOMETIMES- PEOPLE. IF

00:13:07.419 --> 00:13:09.321
ONCE THE PUBLISHERS LIKE WHEN

00:13:09.388 --> 00:13:10.523
THE DATE GETS VERY LARGE IN A

00:13:10.589 --> 00:13:11.757
LARGE PORTION OF THAT DEBT

00:13:11.824 --> 00:13:14.360
ACTUALLY IS NOT TO PAY THE FOR

00:13:14.426 --> 00:13:15.594
THE CHILD SUPPORT IT'S TO PAY

00:13:15.661 --> 00:13:17.163
THE PENALTIES AND INTEREST AND

00:13:17.229 --> 00:13:19.298
SO FORTH. THAT PEOPLE MUCH MORE

00:13:19.365 --> 00:13:20.232
RELUCTANT TO PAY IT BECAUSE I

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.333
DON'T SEE THAT MONEY ACTUALLY

00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:23.502
GOING TO THEIR CHILD. IS THAT

00:13:23.569 --> 00:13:24.937
ISSUE GOING TO BE EXAMINED IN

00:13:25.004 --> 00:13:26.472
YOUR COLLECTIBILITY REPORT TO

00:13:26.539 --> 00:13:28.007
THE ISSUE ABOUT- PEOPLE'S

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:29.141
WILLINGNESS TO ACTUALLY PAY

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:31.377
WHAT'S IN ARREARS. GIVEN WHAT

00:13:31.443 --> 00:13:32.845
THEY MAY KNOW ABOUT THE PORTION

00:13:32.912 --> 00:13:34.346
OF THE FUNDS IT ACTUALLY ENDS

00:13:34.413 --> 00:13:38.851
UP WITH THE CHILD- THAT THEY'RE

00:13:38.918 --> 00:13:40.986
PROVIDING CHILD SUPPORT FOR.

00:13:41.053 --> 00:13:42.421
YOUR QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE OF

00:13:42.488 --> 00:13:44.256
THE- COMPROMISE ARREARS PROGRAM

00:13:44.323 --> 00:13:45.558
IS A PROGRAM THAT WE ARE

00:13:45.624 --> 00:13:49.128
REVAMPING TO EXPAND OUT AND THE

00:13:49.195 --> 00:13:49.662
NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT

00:13:49.728 --> 00:13:51.830
WOULD- BE ABLE TO TAKE

00:13:51.897 --> 00:13:53.432
ADVANTAGE OF THAT OPPORTUNITY.

00:13:53.499 --> 00:13:54.567
THE LIMITATIONS OF THE CO

00:13:54.633 --> 00:13:56.001
PROGRAMS THOUGH ARE THAT A

00:13:56.068 --> 00:13:57.369
PERSON HAS TO PUT FORWARD A

00:13:57.436 --> 00:13:58.671
CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY TO GET

00:13:58.737 --> 00:14:00.673
AND A LARGER AMOUNT RE REMOVED

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.441
FROM DEBT. TO BUILDINGS ARE HE

00:14:02.508 --> 00:14:03.542
REALLY WANTS TO GO ONE STEP

00:14:03.609 --> 00:14:05.277
FURTHER AND LOOK AT CASES

00:14:05.344 --> 00:14:07.313
WHERE. THERE IS NO ABILITY TO

00:14:07.379 --> 00:14:08.781
PAY AND HOW WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO

00:14:08.847 --> 00:14:10.249
RESOLVE THOSE WITHIN SOFTWARE

00:14:10.316 --> 00:14:11.450
PROGRAMS RIGHT NOW ONLY

00:14:11.517 --> 00:14:12.818
CAPACITY TO ADDRESS THOSE IS TO

00:14:12.885 --> 00:14:13.919
CLOSE THE CASE ENTIRELY AND

00:14:13.986 --> 00:14:15.154
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY

00:14:15.221 --> 00:14:16.555
SOMETHING WE'RE ABLE TO DO

00:14:16.622 --> 00:14:17.590
WITHIN OUR CURRENT FRAMEWORK OF

00:14:17.656 --> 00:14:19.291
RULES. THEM RIGHT NOW SO I

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.759
THINK THIS WILL INFORM SOME OF

00:14:20.826 --> 00:14:22.228
THE DECISIONSTHAT NEED TO BE

00:14:22.294 --> 00:14:23.329
MADE ON THE ROAD ON HOW WE GET

00:14:23.395 --> 00:14:25.297
RID OF. AND ACTIVISTS TRULY

00:14:25.364 --> 00:14:26.732
UNCOLLECTIBLE IN ITS ENTIRETY

00:14:26.799 --> 00:14:29.501
OKAY SO I GUESS I WOULD URGE

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:34.373
THAT WE EXPANDED THE SCOPE OF.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:35.808
THIS STUDY- THAT YOU'RE DOING-

00:14:35.874 --> 00:14:36.775
INSTEAD OF JUST NAY MORE NOW.

00:14:36.842 --> 00:14:38.310
LOOKING AT JUST PEOPLE WHO.

00:14:38.377 --> 00:14:40.312
CAN'T PAY THEIR DAD. TO

00:14:40.379 --> 00:14:42.314
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT THE LARGER

00:14:42.381 --> 00:14:45.284
ISSUE OF- HOW DO WE MAXIMIZE

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:48.254
OUR COLLECTION. RATE WHICH IS.

00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.088
TECHNICALLY WHAT THE WHOLE

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:49.922
STATE WAS ABOUT INCLUDING

00:14:49.989 --> 00:14:52.291
YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE K. FACTOR

00:14:52.358 --> 00:14:52.891
BUT REALLY LOOKING AT SOME OF

00:14:52.958 --> 00:14:55.928
THE ISSUES. GUARDING- YOUR

00:14:55.995 --> 00:14:57.463
ABILITY TO COLLECT FROM P. I

00:14:57.529 --> 00:14:58.731
MEAN CERTAINLY WE WANT TO LOOK

00:14:58.797 --> 00:15:00.866
AT WHAT HAPPENS TO PEOPLE WHO

00:15:00.933 --> 00:15:01.900
QUOTE YOU KNOW CAN'T PAY IT AT

00:15:01.967 --> 00:15:04.336
ALL RIGHT NOW BUT ALSO WANT TO

00:15:04.403 --> 00:15:07.139
LOOK MORE BROADLY AT HOW HOW DO

00:15:07.206 --> 00:15:10.409
WE- YOU KNOW HOW DIFFERENT ARE

00:15:10.476 --> 00:15:12.645
DIFFERENT MECHANISMS WE HAVE

00:15:12.711 --> 00:15:13.779
THAT WE PUT IN PLACE LIKE

00:15:13.846 --> 00:15:14.513
WHETHER IT'S INTEREST OR

00:15:14.580 --> 00:15:15.814
PENALTIES AND SO FORTH MAY

00:15:15.881 --> 00:15:16.749
ACTUALLY IMPACT PEOPLE'S

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:18.951
WILLINGNESS. TO PAY BACK THEIR

00:15:19.018 --> 00:15:21.820
DEBT I THINK IT'S A CRITICAL

00:15:21.887 --> 00:15:22.721
QUESTION BECAUSE ULTIMATELY.

00:15:22.788 --> 00:15:24.556
WHAT WE WANNA DO IS WE WANT TO

00:15:24.623 --> 00:15:25.124
MAXIMIZE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:27.960
THAT. CAN GO TO THE CHILD AND

00:15:28.027 --> 00:15:29.228
THEIR FAMILY I MEAN THAT'S

00:15:29.295 --> 00:15:30.262
HOPEFULLY THAT'S THE GOAL OF

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:32.164
CHILD SUPPORT GREAT AND- WE

00:15:32.231 --> 00:15:33.365
SHOULD REALLY BE LOOKING AT

00:15:33.432 --> 00:15:35.034
THAT ISSUE AS WELL AND FIGURE

00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.702
OUT WHAT KIND OF POLICIES THAT

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.370
WE PUT IN PLACE THAT MAXIMIZES

00:15:38.437 --> 00:15:40.072
THE FUNDS THEY'RE GOING TO.

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:41.507
CHILDREN AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT

00:15:41.573 --> 00:15:43.475
BY DOING THAT WE HAVE TO REDUCE

00:15:43.542 --> 00:15:44.977
OTHER STATE EXPENSES AS WELL

00:15:45.044 --> 00:15:46.645
RIGHT SO WE KNOW IF YOU'RE THE

00:15:46.712 --> 00:15:47.880
KIND OF WORKS AND KNOW THAT

00:15:47.946 --> 00:15:50.082
IT'S ADDRESS SO- SO I GUESS I

00:15:50.149 --> 00:15:51.550
WOULD URGE THAT THE SCOPE OF

00:15:51.617 --> 00:15:53.585
YOUR STUDY BE BIT BROADER THAN

00:15:53.652 --> 00:15:55.554
SIMPLY JUST LOOKING AT THE-

00:15:55.621 --> 00:15:57.456
POPULATION OF PEOPLE WHO. BACK

00:15:57.523 --> 00:15:59.058
AT THE POINT WHERE THEY'RE

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:00.959
UNABLE TO PAY AT ALL AND LOOK

00:16:01.026 --> 00:16:02.161
MORE BROADLY AT SERVE

00:16:02.227 --> 00:16:04.296
COLLECTION PRACTICES. AND HOW

00:16:04.363 --> 00:16:05.698
THAT IMPACTS OUR ABILITY TO

00:16:05.764 --> 00:16:07.166
COLLECT PEOPLE'S WILLINGNESS

00:16:07.232 --> 00:16:08.300
AND HOW MUCH EFFORT WE HAVE TO

00:16:08.367 --> 00:16:09.968
TAKES TO TRY TO TEASE PEOPLE

00:16:10.035 --> 00:16:12.404
DOWN TO GET THEM TO PAY- IN

00:16:12.471 --> 00:16:15.441
THAT REGARD SO- I HOPE THAT.

00:16:15.507 --> 00:16:16.275
THAT WHEN YOU COME BACK TO US

00:16:16.342 --> 00:16:18.444
UP AND MADE WITH THIS PROPOSAL

00:16:18.510 --> 00:16:22.948
THAT YOU BE A BROADER. STUDY

00:16:23.015 --> 00:16:24.183
WOULD BE AND ANTICIPATED. A

00:16:24.249 --> 00:16:24.783
GOOD COMMENTS IN THAT IS THE-

00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:25.651
WE'RE TO GO AND THEY'RE ALL

00:16:25.718 --> 00:16:27.720
REALLY. INTO PLAY. IN CONNECT

00:16:27.786 --> 00:16:29.088
TO KATE FACTOR NOT DATING MAX

00:16:29.154 --> 00:16:30.823
IS REALLY TRYING GET ENACTED

00:16:30.889 --> 00:16:32.191
ORDER SO THAT READERS DON'T

00:16:32.257 --> 00:16:33.125
BUILD UP. THE COLLECTABILITY

00:16:33.192 --> 00:16:34.493
SAID HE'S REALLY LOOKING AT

00:16:34.560 --> 00:16:35.828
ALRIGHT WHAT'S ALREADY BUILT UP

00:16:35.894 --> 00:16:36.995
AND HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT

00:16:37.062 --> 00:16:38.764
NIGHT IT'S KIND OF ALL OF THOSE

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:40.432

00:16:43.235 --> 00:16:44.002

FAMILIES- SO I GUESS I WOULD I

00:16:46.305 --> 00:16:48.640
WOULD ASK. SINCE THE IT WAS THE

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:50.709
GOAL OF THE LEGISLATURE TO GET

00:16:50.776 --> 00:16:52.578
TO GET RID OF IT ALTOGETHER-

00:16:52.644 --> 00:16:53.946

WOULD ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT.

00:25:12.010 --> 00:25:13.945
SEVERAL YEARS AGO PART HILLS WE

00:25:14.012 --> 00:25:15.513
CAME TOGETHER AND WE HAD CHILD

00:25:15.580 --> 00:25:16.748

YEAR. NOTE THAT AS WE WERE

00:25:28.927 --> 00:25:33.598
EXAMINING THAT- THAT. THAT THAT.

00:25:33.665 --> 00:25:36.935
WE ACTUALLY END UP BY FULLY

00:25:37.002 --> 00:25:40.472
INVESTING GENERATING MORE MONEY

00:25:40.538 --> 00:25:41.806
FOR CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:44.843
THAN BY NOT AND SO I DO WANT TO

00:25:44.910 --> 00:25:50.115
KEEP THAT IN MIND AS WERE QUOTE-PUTTING A PIES BECAUSE THE

00:25:50.181 --> 00:25:52.317
ULTIMATE IMPACT AT LEAST FOUR

00:25:52.384 --> 00:25:54.286
WE LOOK AT IT SEVERAL YEARS AGO

00:25:54.352 --> 00:25:56.354
WAS IS THAT- OUR LACK OF

00:25:56.421 --> 00:25:58.623
INVESTMENT IN- CHAU IT

00:25:58.690 --> 00:25:59.624
INCIDENTS HAPPEN THEIR CHILD

00:25:59.691 --> 00:26:01.192
SUPPORT AGENCIES IN A CHILD

00:26:01.259 --> 00:26:02.861
SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE ACTUALLY

00:26:02.928 --> 00:26:05.263
ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN

00:26:05.330 --> 00:26:06.865
ESSENTIALLY CHILDREN AND THEIR

00:26:06.932 --> 00:26:08.967
FAMILIES GETTING LESS RESOURCES

00:26:09.034 --> 00:26:09.801
I MEAN THAT'S THE REASON WE

00:26:09.868 --> 00:26:11.536
HAVE CHILD SUPPORT IN FACT AT

00:26:11.603 --> 00:26:13.038
THE BULLS DON'T. TRY THINK HOW

00:26:13.104 --> 00:26:15.106
LONG W. EVEN AT SOME POINT WE

00:26:15.173 --> 00:26:16.007
WERE PENALIZED BY THE FEDERAL

00:26:16.074 --> 00:26:17.609
GOVERNMENT BY HAD PADLEY WE

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:19.878
WERE DOING SO WELL I CERTAINLY

00:26:19.945 --> 00:26:20.845
APPRECIATE IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:26:20.912 --> 00:26:23.181
PROPOSAL THAT THERE IS SOME

00:26:23.248 --> 00:26:25.250
INCREASE THAT'S BEING PROPOSED

00:26:25.317 --> 00:26:27.452
AND I THINK PROPERLY TARGETED I

00:26:27.519 --> 00:26:29.688
GUESS I WOULD ALSO APPEAL SAY

00:26:29.754 --> 00:26:31.523
THAT- WE REALLY SHOULD BE

00:26:31.589 --> 00:26:33.258
TRYING TO WORK TOWARD FULLY

00:26:33.325 --> 00:26:34.726
FUNDING WHAT WE AGREED TO

00:26:34.793 --> 00:26:36.728
SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND IF WE

00:26:36.795 --> 00:26:38.697
CAN'T DO IT THIS YEAR- WE

00:26:38.763 --> 00:26:39.664
SHOULD AT LEAST IN THE OUT

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:41.366
YEARS BE LOOKING AT ME THAT

00:26:41.433 --> 00:26:42.434
MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION

00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.535
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY THIS IS

00:26:43.601 --> 00:26:45.036
ABOUT TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE

00:26:45.103 --> 00:26:46.805
AMOUNT OF FUNDING WE CAN GET TO

00:26:46.871 --> 00:26:47.839
CHILDREN THEIR FAMILIES THROUGH

00:26:47.906 --> 00:26:49.975
THE CHILD. SUPPORT SYSTEM AND

00:26:50.041 --> 00:26:51.609
I'M AFRAID THAT BY PUTTING A

00:26:51.676 --> 00:26:55.046
PIES- IF WE CONTINUE TO STAY IN

00:26:55.113 --> 00:26:56.348
A PAUSE MODE WERE ACTUALLY

00:26:56.414 --> 00:26:57.649
GIVING UP ARE ACTUALLY GIVING

00:26:57.716 --> 00:27:00.752
UP WE ARE DECREASING WHAT WE

00:27:00.819 --> 00:27:01.519
WERE ANTICIPATING WE'RE ABLE TO

00:27:01.586 --> 00:27:04.122
DO SO- I GUESS I WOULD URGE

00:27:04.189 --> 00:27:06.257
THAT- VOICE ONLY APPRECIATE

00:27:06.324 --> 00:27:07.625
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED HERE IF

00:27:07.692 --> 00:27:08.693
IT'S POSSIBLE TO TRY TO

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.663
pCERTAINLY AT THE YEARS WE

00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:13.898
SHOULD BE PLANNING TO FULLY

00:27:13.965 --> 00:27:17.769
pPROPOSALS THAT WE CAME TO AN

00:27:17.836 --> 00:27:20.271

AS STIPULATIONS- FOR ELECTRONIC

PRINT THAT DOCUMENT AND HAVE IT

00:29:23.228 --> 00:29:25.296
FILED SO GREATLY REDUCES THE

TIME IT TAKES TO CIRCULATE

00:29:28.833 --> 00:29:29.701
THESE DOCUMENTS. AND WE'RE

00:29:29.767 --> 00:29:31.035
GONNA BE HAPPENING SAID THAT

00:29:31.102 --> 00:29:33.638
SYSTEM UP. YES WE ALREADY HAVE

00:29:33.705 --> 00:29:35.940
THIS AVAILABLE FOR ABOUT TWENTY

00:29:36.007 --> 00:29:37.175
FIVE COUNTIES SO IT WOULD BE

00:29:37.242 --> 00:29:38.943
JUST PROVIDING ACCESS TO OUR

00:29:39.010 --> 00:29:40.378
ELECTRONIC SIGNATURE TOOL TO

THE REST OF OUR COUNTIES

00:29:41.613 --> 00:29:43.448
EVENTUALLY WE WOULD UTILIZE OUR

00:29:43.515 --> 00:29:46.217
EXISTING STATEWIDE. OUR SYSTEM

00:29:46.284 --> 00:29:47.085

THROUGH THE SIGNATURE TOOL

00:29:49.287 --> 00:29:50.955
TODAY SO THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO

00:29:51.022 --> 00:29:52.257
COST ASSOCIATED WITH THE TODAY

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:53.158
SO IT'S A MORE LOW TECH

00:29:53.224 --> 00:29:55.326
APPROACH- TO BE ABLE TO GET

00:29:55.393 --> 00:29:56.594

THE ALLOWANCE OF ELECTRONIC

00:30:25.423 --> 00:30:27.358
SIGNATURE WAS IDENTIFIED AS A

00:30:27.425 --> 00:30:28.793
BEST PRACTICE IN OPERATIONAL

00:30:28.860 --> 00:30:31.896
