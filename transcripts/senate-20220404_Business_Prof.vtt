00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:19.252
THIRTY YEARS AGO WHEN I WAS

MANAGING A COMMUNITY CLINIC-

00:05:21.688 --> 00:05:23.489

00:05:23.556 --> 00:05:24.524
CENTER. IF I'D STILL BE TALKING

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.492
ABOUT DEFENDING ROE VERSUS WADE

00:05:26.559 --> 00:05:28.061
AND FIGHTING FOR ABORTION ACCESS

00:05:28.127 --> 00:05:30.763
IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO. I WOULD

00:05:30.830 --> 00:05:32.298
HAVE SAID I CERTAINLY HOPE NOT.

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:34.634
BUT HERE WE ARE. IN STATE HOUSES

00:05:34.701 --> 00:05:36.069
IN COURTHOUSES ACROSS THE

SUPREME COURT ARE REPRODUCTIVE

00:05:38.838 --> 00:05:41.007
RIGHTS ARE BEING STOLEN FROM US.

00:05:41.074 --> 00:05:42.308
ONCE AGAIN WOMEN ARE BEING

00:05:42.375 --> 00:05:44.077
PUSHED TO EXTREME MEASURES TO

00:05:44.143 --> 00:05:46.012
ACCESS ABORTION CARE. AND ONCE

00:05:46.079 --> 00:05:48.081
AGAIN THEY FACE HAVING TO PUT

00:05:48.147 --> 00:05:49.816
THEIR BODIES IN DANGER. AND

00:05:49.882 --> 00:05:52.051
THAT'S WHY WE FIND OURSELVES YET

00:05:52.118 --> 00:05:54.687
AGAIN IN A POSITION OF DEFENSE.

00:05:54.754 --> 00:05:56.055
NO I LEARNED A LONG TIME AGO ON

00:05:56.122 --> 00:05:57.523
THE BASKETBALL COURT THE BEST

00:05:57.590 --> 00:05:59.859
DEFENSE IS A GOOD OFFENSE AND

00:05:59.926 --> 00:06:01.928
THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT.

00:06:01.994 --> 00:06:03.663
BY GIVING MORE TRAINED AND

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:05.465
QUALIFIED NURSE PRACTITIONERS

00:06:05.531 --> 00:06:07.300
THE ABILITY TO PROVIDE ABORTIONS

00:06:07.366 --> 00:06:08.968
WITHOUT THE SUPERVISION OF A

00:06:09.035 --> 00:06:11.604
DOCTOR. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE

00:06:11.671 --> 00:06:14.040
IS A PROACTIVE STEP TO FURTHER

00:06:14.107 --> 00:06:15.808
INCREASE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE

00:06:15.875 --> 00:06:17.710
QUALITY REPRODUCTIVE CARE IN

00:06:17.777 --> 00:06:20.413
CALIFORNIA. OUR STATE IS FACING

00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:22.014
A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF PRIMARY

00:06:22.081 --> 00:06:24.617
CARE CLINICIANS. ESPECIALLY IN

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:25.718
THE LATINO BLACK AND NATIVE

00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:27.987
AMERICAN COMMUNITIES A PROBLEM

00:06:28.054 --> 00:06:30.423
THAT'S EXPECTED TO GET EVEN MORE

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.391
DIRE OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

00:06:32.458 --> 00:06:34.494
CURRENTLY OVER 40% OF COUNTIES

00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:36.095
IN CALIFORNIA DON'T EVEN HAVE

00:06:36.162 --> 00:06:37.797
CLINICS OR PROVIDERS THAT

00:06:37.864 --> 00:06:40.299
PROVIDE ABORTION. THOSE TWO

00:06:40.366 --> 00:06:42.235
FACTORS COMBINED ME THAT FAR TOO

00:06:42.301 --> 00:06:43.503
MANY PREGNANT PEOPLE WHO MAY

00:06:43.569 --> 00:06:45.805
NEED TO CONSIDER ABORTION AS AN

00:06:45.872 --> 00:06:49.275
OPTION CAN I DO SO. SB THIRTEEN

00:06:49.342 --> 00:06:50.877
SEVENTY FIVE WOULD OFFER THAT

00:06:50.943 --> 00:06:52.078
OPTION TO MORE WOMEN AND

00:06:52.145 --> 00:06:53.813
FAMILIES. CALIFORNIA HAS LONG

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.548
BEEN A LEADER IN REPRODUCTIVE

00:06:55.615 --> 00:06:58.317
RIGHTS. BUT THE PRACTICAL NEED

00:06:58.384 --> 00:07:00.520
TO ENSURE REAL ACCESS IS FAR

00:07:00.586 --> 00:07:03.823
FROM DONE. ONE EARLY STEP I TOOK

00:07:03.890 --> 00:07:06.225
WAS OFFERING AB ONE FIFTY FOUR

00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:08.227

00:07:09.962 --> 00:07:11.464

OF A DOCTOR TO INCLUDE NURSE

00:07:15.334 --> 00:07:17.403
PRACTITIONERS. IN SEVEN YEARS

00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:20.673
LATER THE LEGISLATURE PASSED AB

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:21.207

THE SUPERVISION OF A DOCTOR. AND

00:07:30.283 --> 00:07:32.251
NOW WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THOSE

00:07:32.318 --> 00:07:33.119
LAWS CAN WORK TOGETHER IN

00:07:33.186 --> 00:07:36.022
UNISON. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE

00:07:36.088 --> 00:07:37.323
WOULD MAKE IT CLEAR THAT NURSE

00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:38.491
PRACTITIONERS WHO PRACTICE

00:07:38.558 --> 00:07:40.960

PRACTITIONERS PLAY A CRITICAL

00:07:56.576 --> 00:07:58.110
ROLE IN PROVIDING REPRODUCTIVE

00:07:58.177 --> 00:08:00.980
CARE. ALLOWING EXPERIENCED PART

NURSE PRACTITIONERS TO UTILIZE

00:08:03.049 --> 00:08:04.617
THEIR FULL TRAINING AND

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:05.785
EDUCATION WILL EXPAND THE NUMBER

00:08:05.852 --> 00:08:07.386
OF QUALIFIED REPRODUCTIVE CARE

00:08:07.453 --> 00:08:10.523
PRACTITIONERS. PARTICULARLY IN

00:08:10.590 --> 00:08:13.759

WHILE ALSO LIFTING UP A

WORKFORCE OF SKILLED NURSE

00:08:25.638 --> 00:08:26.939

THEIR PATIENTS. WHILE TIME SEEMS

00:08:31.611 --> 00:08:32.845
TO BE MOVING BACKWARDS I THINK

IN MANY PLACES ACROSS THE NATION

00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:36.515

PREVIOUS BILL AB ONE FIFTY FOUR

00:12:44.063 --> 00:12:45.297
WAS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:46.799
ABORTION CARE BY EXPANDING THE

00:12:46.866 --> 00:12:48.334
TYPES OF PROVIDERS WHO PERFORM

00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.369

CALIFORNIA AND PEACE WHO ARE

00:12:52.037 --> 00:12:53.372

PROVIDERS WHO WILL TRAIN THEM AS

00:12:58.477 --> 00:12:59.778
MANY OF THE TRAINING PROCEDURES

00:12:59.845 --> 00:13:01.981
ARE GIVEN TO PHYSICIAN RESIDENTS

00:13:02.047 --> 00:13:03.716
RATHER THAN OTHER PROVIDERS.

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:04.850
THERE IS A PARTICULAR DEARTH OF

00:13:04.917 --> 00:13:06.552
TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES IN AREAS

00:13:06.619 --> 00:13:08.287

MERCED. SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY FIVE

00:13:11.390 --> 00:13:13.659
WOULD NOT ONLY INCREASE ACCESS

00:13:13.726 --> 00:13:14.326
TO THESE SERVICES BUT WOULD GROW

00:13:14.393 --> 00:13:15.628
THE PROVIDER POOL SINCE

00:13:15.694 --> 00:13:17.363
EXPERIENCED MPS COULD TRAIN

00:13:17.429 --> 00:13:18.931
OTHER MPS ON ABORTION

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:21.300
PROCEDURES. THERE IS NO REASON

00:13:21.367 --> 00:13:22.801
THAT ABORTION SHOULD BE TREATED

00:13:22.868 --> 00:13:23.869
DIFFERENTLY FROM OTHER

00:13:23.936 --> 00:13:25.871

SUPERVISING PHYSICIAN WAS NOT

00:13:32.211 --> 00:13:34.213
PHYSICALLY PRESENT. OFTEN HOURS

CALL FOR HELP. SB THIRTEEN

00:13:42.121 --> 00:13:44.323

STANDARDIZED PROCEDURES THAT

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:49.361
LIMIT THE NUMBERS OF MPS WHO CAN

00:13:49.428 --> 00:13:51.463
PRACTICE. I RECENTLY HAD A

ONLY ASK FOR OFFICIAL CONVICTION

00:58:45.355 --> 00:58:47.223

THE CONVICTIONS THEY PUT ON

00:58:53.596 --> 00:58:55.465

00:59:10.313 --> 00:59:11.314

01:00:12.842 --> 01:00:14.077
ABOUT- YOU KNOW FIRST WHY I

SHOULD SAY I APPLAUD THE GOALS

01:00:15.411 --> 01:00:17.580
OF THIS PARTICULAR. BILL I THINK

01:00:17.647 --> 01:00:19.682
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE PROVIDE

01:00:19.749 --> 01:00:20.883
TRANSPARENCY WE PROVIDE

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:22.885

01:00:28.424 --> 01:00:29.692
THE BURDENS THAT WERE IMPOSING

01:00:29.759 --> 01:00:31.194
ON BUSINESSES ACROSS THE BOAR

01:00:31.260 --> 01:00:33.863
HERE IN THE STATE- IT DOES

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:35.932
STRIKE ME I CERTAINLY RESPECT.

01:00:35.999 --> 01:00:37.100
THE FACT THAT LITTLE HOOVER

01:00:37.166 --> 01:00:39.535
COMMISSION A BODY ON WHICH I

01:00:39.602 --> 01:00:41.504
SAID IS SUPPORTING THIS BILL-

01:00:41.571 --> 01:00:42.839
THE FACT THAT I CHAIR NOVELS

01:00:42.905 --> 01:00:44.140
HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF

01:00:44.207 --> 01:00:46.109
THIS BUT BUT I DO HAVE QUESTIONS

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.176
ABOUT HOW REDUNDANT THIS BILL IS

01:00:47.243 --> 01:00:49.245
WHAT THE COST OF THIS BILL IS

01:00:49.312 --> 01:00:50.947
GOING TO BE BOTH THE STATE. I

01:00:51.014 --> 01:00:52.648
ENTERED THE BUSINESSES AND THE

01:00:52.715 --> 01:00:53.216
PROFESSIONALS THAT IT WILL

01:00:53.282 --> 01:00:55.918
IMPACT. AND I KNOW THAT THIS

01:00:55.985 --> 01:00:57.220
BILL AT THIS POINT DOES NOT HAVE

01:00:57.286 --> 01:00:59.489
A FISCAL IMPACT- IT'S SOMETHING

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:01.424
THAT I THINK IS UNDER STUDY- SO

01:01:01.491 --> 01:01:03.192
I GUESS MY QUESTION TO CHERNOV A

01:01:03.259 --> 01:01:05.128
INTO THE AUTHOR IS. I DO WE HAVE

01:01:05.194 --> 01:01:06.662
ANY SENSE OF WHAT THE POTENTIAL

01:01:06.729 --> 01:01:09.032
COST MIGHT BE- AND DO WE HAVE

01:01:09.098 --> 01:01:10.500
ANY SENSE OF AGAIN MAY MAYBE

01:01:10.566 --> 01:01:12.068
THIS IS ALREADY BEEN. ANSWERED

01:01:12.135 --> 01:01:14.570
TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE BUT- YOU

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.773
KNOW IS THERE A WAY TO REDUCE

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:17.940
THE REDUNDANCY OF THIS BILL SO

01:01:18.007 --> 01:01:19.042
THERE'S NOT CREATING OVERLAPPING

01:01:19.108 --> 01:01:20.443
REGULATIONS OF THE KIND THAT TOO

01:01:20.510 --> 01:01:24.047

01:01:35.992 --> 01:01:37.960
QUESTION ON THE REDUNDANCY YOU

01:01:38.027 --> 01:01:41.564

INFORMATION ON. THEIR WEBSITE

01:01:52.075 --> 01:01:53.709
BUT I THINK THAT'S NECESSARY AS

01:01:53.776 --> 01:01:57.713
PART OF THE BILL- ACCOMPLISH THE

01:01:57.780 --> 01:01:59.982
GOALS OF THE BILL AS FAR AS THE

01:02:00.049 --> 01:02:03.119
COST- I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE THAT

01:02:03.186 --> 01:02:06.022
WORKED OUT IN APPROPRIATIONS. I

01:02:06.089 --> 01:02:06.989

IMPORTANT AND A GOOD SIGNAL- BUT

01:02:30.213 --> 01:02:31.347

MARIJUANA IN THE STATE IS THAT

01:21:42.697 --> 01:21:44.065
THOSE WHO PLAY BY THE RULES

PAY THE FEES AND TAXES I HAVE TO

01:21:49.070 --> 01:21:51.206

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.143

FOLKS TO BE AND- WHEN THEY'RE

RESOURCES FOR EIGHT YEARS.

01:22:54.803 --> 01:22:56.037
BECAUSE OUR DEPARTMENT OF FISH

01:22:56.104 --> 01:22:58.440

PESTICIDES THAT WERE

01:23:13.154 --> 01:23:16.358
QUESTIONABLE. BOB AT AT AT LEAST

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:18.426
ONE OF THEM I DON'T KNOW IF IT

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.194
WAS THAT ONE PEOPLE WERE HEAVILY

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.629
ARMED. THERE WAS NO STANDARDS OR

01:23:21.696 --> 01:23:23.765
TESTING OF THE PRODUCT IS

01:23:23.832 --> 01:23:25.900

AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IN THIS BILL

CLEAR THERE IS AN ONGOING. STAY

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:44.077
AT THIS ABOUT WHETHER CITIES ARE

ON AS LONG AS- THAT THOSE LIMIT

01:55:13.573 --> 01:55:15.908
THOSE LIMITATIONS. MARIN SO

01:55:15.975 --> 01:55:18.978
SEVERE THAT IT EFFECTIVELY- YOU

01:55:19.045 --> 01:55:22.248
KNOW- MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR

01:55:22.315 --> 01:55:23.483
OVERLY HARD FOR PEOPLE TO

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:25.184

01:55:25.251 --> 01:55:26.419
NUMBER IF THEY GO WITH

01:55:26.486 --> 01:55:28.021

STOREFRONTS THEY WILL HAVE.

01:55:29.455 --> 01:55:30.957
SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY THERE

01:55:31.024 --> 01:55:33.660
THEY DON'T HAVE TO ALLOW AS MANY

01:55:33.726 --> 01:55:35.595
AS PEOPLE WANT TO BUILD. THEY

01:55:35.662 --> 01:55:37.497

NUMBER- SO YOU KNOW FOR EXAMPLE.

01:55:45.571 --> 01:55:47.073
A SMALL TOWN. AND IF THEY GO

01:55:47.140 --> 01:55:49.375
WITH STORE FRONT ONE DISPENSARY

01:55:49.442 --> 01:55:51.644
MAY BE HIGHLY REASONABLE. IF THE

01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:53.379
IF THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHICH

01:55:53.446 --> 01:55:54.547
IS AN ISSUE THERE BECAUSE THEY

01:55:54.614 --> 01:55:56.115
ALLOW CAMERAS. CITY OF LOS

01:55:56.182 --> 01:55:57.750
ANGELES AND ONE DISPENSARY.

01:55:57.817 --> 01:55:59.352
THAT'S PROBABLY ON REASONABLE

01:55:59.419 --> 01:56:00.320
FOR CITY OF ALMOST THREE

01:56:00.386 --> 01:56:03.756
MILLION. PEOPLE DAVID CAN YOU

01:56:03.823 --> 01:56:05.458
KNOW. THEY DON'T HAVE

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:06.759
STOREFRONTS FOR EXAMPLE THEY

01:56:06.826 --> 01:56:08.461
DON'T HAVE TO LET IT BE OPEN

01:56:08.528 --> 01:56:10.663
TWENTY FOUR SEVEN. THEY CAN PUT

01:56:10.730 --> 01:56:12.565
REASONABLE HOURS LIMITATIONS-

01:56:12.632 --> 01:56:14.500
BUT NINE YEAR THEY CAN'T BUT IF

01:56:14.567 --> 01:56:16.569
THEY SAID YOU CAN BE OPEN ONE

01:56:16.636 --> 01:56:17.537
HOUR A WEEK. THAT WOULD CLEARLY

01:56:17.603 --> 01:56:21.107
BE. UNREASONABLE ON IF SOMEONE

01:56:21.174 --> 01:56:23.009
CHALLENGES THE CITY'S

01:56:23.076 --> 01:56:23.509
DETERMINATION OF WHAT'S

01:56:23.576 --> 01:56:26.479
REASONABLE. THE CITY WILL BE

01:56:26.546 --> 01:56:29.582
THAT THE WHAT WE CALL. AN ABUSE

01:56:29.649 --> 01:56:30.616
OF DISCRETION STANDARD WOULD BE

01:56:30.683 --> 01:56:32.251
APPLIED. WHICH MEANS THAT AS

01:56:32.318 --> 01:56:34.454
LONG AS THERE'S SOME REASONABLE

01:56:34.520 --> 01:56:36.489
BASIS FOR WHAT THE CITY DECIDED.

01:56:36.556 --> 01:56:37.890
THE CITY WILL HAVE BROAD

01:56:37.957 --> 01:56:45.164
LATITUDE- SO CITIES WILL STILL

01:56:45.231 --> 01:56:46.499
HI SIGNIFICANT PART. THEY SIMPLY

01:56:46.566 --> 01:56:48.701
CAN'T DO ACCOUNTABLE BAN ANYMORE

01:56:48.768 --> 01:56:50.269
. THAT THANK YOU IN AND THAT'S

01:56:50.336 --> 01:56:53.973
HELPFUL- SO. I THINK. YOU'VE

01:56:54.040 --> 01:56:55.141
UNDERSCORED THAT CITY IS THAT

01:56:55.208 --> 01:56:56.876
LOCALITIES CITIES AND COUNTIES

01:56:56.943 --> 01:56:59.545
WILL HAVE A STILL CONTINUE TO

01:56:59.612 --> 01:57:01.214
HAVE- SERVE LATITUDE THANK THEY

01:57:01.280 --> 01:57:03.082
COULD ACTUALLY OF- ELIMINATE

01:57:03.149 --> 01:57:04.884
STORMS SAY WE WANT A STOREFRONT

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:06.219
AND AGAIN THIS IS A JUST ABOUT

01:57:06.285 --> 01:57:07.954
MEDICAL CANNABIS THIS IS NOT

01:57:08.020 --> 01:57:09.789
CAMPUS OVERALL THE MEDICAL

01:57:09.856 --> 01:57:10.990
CANNABIS THAT THEY WOULD STILL

01:57:11.057 --> 01:57:12.492
BUT THEN THEY WOULD STILL NEED

01:57:12.558 --> 01:57:14.026
TO ALLOW PEOPLE LIVE IN THEIR TO

01:57:14.093 --> 01:57:15.762
HAVE ACCESS TO IT THROUGH THE

01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:19.098
LIVERY. SO SO WITH THAT ANY

01:57:19.165 --> 01:57:21.467
APPRECIATE CLARIFICATIONS I

01:57:21.534 --> 01:57:22.902
THINK THAT THE VOTERS DID SAY

01:57:22.969 --> 01:57:24.070
THAT PEOPLE SHOULD HAVE ACCESS

01:57:24.137 --> 01:57:25.972
TO MEDICAL CANNABIS AND I THINK

01:57:26.038 --> 01:57:28.574
THAT- AND SO THE NINE THEM

01:57:28.641 --> 01:57:31.711
DANCE- BY BASICALLY ELIMINATE

01:57:31.778 --> 01:57:33.646
ALL OPPORTUNITIES I THINK THIS

01:57:33.713 --> 01:57:35.848
IS PROBLEMATIC AND SO BUT I DO

PART WHY THE- THE HANDOUT WHICH

03:17:55.263 --> 03:17:57.098
SEEMS MORE REASONABLE. AND THEN

03:17:57.165 --> 03:17:58.833
THE LABELING AND WHILE THERE'S A

03:17:58.900 --> 03:18:00.935
LOT OF DETAILED INFORMATION.

ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF LABELING

03:18:06.207 --> 03:18:07.909
AND HOW LABELING WOULD INDEED

03:18:07.976 --> 03:18:12.146
HELP. AND THEN. THIS JUST JUST

03:18:12.213 --> 03:18:15.049
IMPACTS. THE LEGAL MARKET WHICH

03:18:15.116 --> 03:18:17.118
IS ONLY PLACE WE CAN IMPACT.

03:18:17.185 --> 03:18:19.187
WHICH IS ALREADY STRUGGLING AND

03:18:19.254 --> 03:18:21.256
BY DEFINITION IS MORE IS SAFER

03:18:21.322 --> 03:18:23.725
THAN THE ILLEGAL MARKET SO HOW

03:18:23.791 --> 03:18:26.294
DOES THIS CONTINUE TO KEEP OUR

03:18:26.361 --> 03:18:28.162
LEGAL MARKET. FUNCTIONAL THREE

03:18:28.229 --> 03:18:29.731
QUESTIONS HOW DOES COOPER LEGAL

03:18:29.797 --> 03:18:32.200
MARKET FUNCTIONING WHAT DATA DO

03:18:32.267 --> 03:18:36.004
WE REALLY HAVE ON THE IMPACTS OF

03:18:36.070 --> 03:18:38.172
LABELING. AND THERE WAS A STUDY

03:18:38.239 --> 03:18:40.108
FUNDED IN TWENTY TWENTY ON TO

03:18:40.174 --> 03:18:42.010
LOOK AT THE IMPACTS OF LABELING

03:18:42.076 --> 03:18:43.511
AND WE STILL HAVEN'T RECEIVED

03:18:43.578 --> 03:18:46.648
THAT AS I UNDERSTAND IT- AND

03:18:46.714 --> 03:18:47.915
THEN WIDE BY THE TWO PART

03:18:47.982 --> 03:18:49.817
APPROACH. OKAY THANK YOU FOR

03:18:49.884 --> 03:18:52.453
SUCH A QUESTION SIR AG MEN UP

03:18:52.520 --> 03:18:54.422
FIRST OF ALL I WANNA SAY THAT

03:18:54.489 --> 03:18:57.659
THE- YEAH WE ACTUALLY DO WANT TO

03:18:57.725 --> 03:18:59.460
DISCOURAGE USE OF ILLICIT

03:18:59.527 --> 03:19:03.398
CANNABIS AND- AND CERTAINLY-

03:19:03.464 --> 03:19:05.300
YEAH. WELL PART OF IT IS

03:19:05.366 --> 03:19:07.468
EDUCATING PEOPLE ABOUT THE NOT

03:19:07.535 --> 03:19:08.436
JUST THE DANGERS CANNABIS BUT

03:19:08.503 --> 03:19:10.038
PARTICULARLY INCLUDING DANGERS

03:19:10.104 --> 03:19:12.206
OF ILLICIT CANNABIS NOW BELIEVE

03:19:12.273 --> 03:19:14.409
THAT THESE. LABELS ARE ALSO CITE

03:19:14.475 --> 03:19:15.910
THE ILLICIT PEOPLE CRY AND

03:19:15.977 --> 03:19:17.712
LIKELY TO PUT THE LABELS ON

03:19:17.779 --> 03:19:20.114
OTHER TECHNICALLY I THINK THEY

03:19:20.181 --> 03:19:20.848
COULD BE YOU KNOW ACTUALLY

03:19:20.915 --> 03:19:21.616
PROSECUTE THEY DON'T HAVE THE

03:19:21.683 --> 03:19:22.817
LABELS ON. BECAUSE THEY'RE

03:19:22.884 --> 03:19:24.419
SELLING CANNABIS IN ADDITION TO

03:19:24.485 --> 03:19:25.219
ALL THE OTHERS IS THAT THEY

03:19:25.286 --> 03:19:26.921
COULD BE PROSECUTED FOR. THE AND

03:19:26.988 --> 03:19:28.489
IN TERMS OF THE- EVENTS AROUND

03:19:28.556 --> 03:19:30.358
THE LABELING ITSELF WE DO HAVE

03:19:30.425 --> 03:19:32.560
EVIDENCE FROM EXPERIENCE WITH

03:19:32.627 --> 03:19:34.329
TOBACCO AND LABELING TOBACCO

03:19:34.395 --> 03:19:36.798
PRODUCTS- IN TERMS OF THE

03:19:36.864 --> 03:19:37.632
EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LABELING

03:19:37.699 --> 03:19:40.702
PARTICULARLY DISCOURAGING- USE

03:19:40.768 --> 03:19:43.738
BY YOUTH- AND- BE SURE THAT. YOU

03:19:43.805 --> 03:19:45.473
KNOW PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE

03:19:45.540 --> 03:19:47.809
DIFFERENT- CHALLENGES THAT ARE

03:19:47.875 --> 03:19:51.179
RAISED BY- TOBACCO IN AND IN

03:19:51.245 --> 03:19:53.348
THIS CASE- THAT CANNABIS THAT

03:19:53.414 --> 03:19:55.450
REASON FOR THE TWO STAGES IS

03:19:55.516 --> 03:19:58.353
THAT- CERTAINLY AGAIN I WILL

03:19:58.419 --> 03:20:00.755
KNOW WHEN. WE TOOK AMENDMENTS

03:20:00.822 --> 03:20:02.824
AND ALSO WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT

03:20:02.890 --> 03:20:04.359
YOU KNOW THE LABELS AND LIKE THE

03:20:04.425 --> 03:20:05.827
WHOLE PACKAGE RIGHT SO YOU

03:20:05.893 --> 03:20:07.662
THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH INFORMATION

03:20:07.729 --> 03:20:08.996
YOU CAN PUT ON A LABEL BUT- TO

03:20:09.063 --> 03:20:09.964
BE SURE THAT. IT'S TIME

03:20:10.031 --> 03:20:11.332
CUSTOMERS DO YOU HAVE THE

03:20:11.399 --> 03:20:12.433
INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT SAID

03:20:12.500 --> 03:20:15.136
PEOPLE MAY NOT BE AWARE. THAT

03:20:15.203 --> 03:20:17.271
THAT MODERN- CANNABIS OFTEN

03:20:17.338 --> 03:20:19.340
TIMES MORE POTENT THAN PERHAPS

03:20:19.407 --> 03:20:21.075
THAN. SOME PEOPLE WOULD USE IN

03:20:21.142 --> 03:20:23.411
THE PAST OR- ARE THAT- THEY

03:20:23.478 --> 03:20:24.912
REMEMBER TO HEAR FROM OTHER

03:20:24.979 --> 03:20:26.481
PEOPLE AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S

03:20:26.547 --> 03:20:28.082
IMPORTANT PEOPLE HAVE UP TO DATE

03:20:28.149 --> 03:20:29.250
INFORMATION. WHICH WOULD BE

03:20:29.317 --> 03:20:30.418
SOMETHING THAT WOULD THAT YOU

03:20:30.485 --> 03:20:33.388
CAN. EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL IN A

03:20:33.454 --> 03:20:34.689
BROCHURE YOU KNOW I. HAVEN'T PUT

03:20:34.756 --> 03:20:36.657
IT ALL INTO A LABEL AND THE

03:20:36.724 --> 03:20:37.625
LABEL WOULD. BASICALLY KEEP

03:20:37.692 --> 03:20:39.360
POINT INTO ROTATING LABELS WELL.

03:20:39.427 --> 03:20:41.729
AND THIS BUT THE SCIENCE ON THE

03:20:41.796 --> 03:20:42.897
LABELING COMES FROM OUR

03:20:42.964 --> 03:20:44.265
EXPERIENCE AND KNOWLEDGE FROM.

03:20:44.332 --> 03:20:47.235
FROM LABELING AND TOBACCO. AND

03:20:47.301 --> 03:20:48.870
AND SO THERE'S A CONSIDERABLE

03:20:48.936 --> 03:20:50.171
EVIDENCE FOR THE EFFECTIVENESS

03:20:50.238 --> 03:20:53.474
OF THAT TYPE OF LABELING FROM

03:20:53.541 --> 03:20:54.509
THAT EXPERIENCE. OKAY I

03:20:54.575 --> 03:20:56.043
APPRECIATE YOUR ANSWER I MEAN I

03:20:56.110 --> 03:20:57.812
DON'T KNOW THAT IT'S ANALOGOUS

03:20:57.879 --> 03:20:58.780
TO TOBACCO BECAUSE WE DIDN'T

03:20:58.846 --> 03:21:00.415
HAVE A LEGAL AND ILLEGAL ILLICIT

03:22:48.823 --> 03:22:50.224
OF THE TYPE OF WARNINGS THAT

03:22:50.291 --> 03:22:55.129
WERE USED FOR TOBACCO PRODUCTS-

03:22:55.196 --> 03:22:56.831
BUT I'M LOOKING AT A STUDY HERE

03:22:56.898 --> 03:23:00.334
FROM JAVA THAT SAYS. HE DID A

03:23:00.401 --> 03:23:02.069
RANDOMIZED CLINICAL TRIAL. SAYS

03:23:02.136 --> 03:23:04.238
THT THEY FOUND GRAPHIC WARNING

03:23:04.305 --> 03:23:05.773
LABELS DECREASED POSITIVE

03:23:05.840 --> 03:23:08.809
PERCEPTION OF CIGARETTES BUT

03:23:08.876 --> 03:23:10.811
WITHOUT CLEARLY INCREASING

03:23:10.878 --> 03:23:13.080
HEALTH CONCERNS AND THEY ALSO

03:23:13.147 --> 03:23:14.448
INCREASED QUITTING COGNITIONS

03:23:14.515 --> 03:23:16.317
BUT DID NOT AFFECT EITHER

03:23:16.384 --> 03:23:19.020
CIGARETTE SENSATION CESSATION OR

03:23:19.086 --> 03:23:22.290
CONSUMPTION LEVELS SO I'M JUST.

03:23:22.356 --> 03:23:25.560
IS THERE. WHAT STUDY IS IT THAT

03:23:25.626 --> 03:23:26.861
YOU ARE REFERRING TO THAT

03:23:26.928 --> 03:23:28.496
SUGGESTS THAT PUTTING A WARNING

03:23:28.563 --> 03:23:31.832
LABEL NOT A GRAPHIC ONE LIKE-

03:23:31.899 --> 03:23:34.135
THIS STUDY SUGGESTS BY WHAT

03:23:34.201 --> 03:23:35.636
CITIES ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

03:23:35.703 --> 03:23:37.705
THAT. WHAT WOULD INDICATE THAT A

03:23:37.772 --> 03:23:39.707
WARNING LABEL FOR CANNABIS USE

03:23:39.774 --> 03:23:42.510
WOULD HAVE ANY EFFECT AT ALL ON.

03:23:42.577 --> 03:23:45.112
THE USER. WELL I THINK THAT

03:23:45.179 --> 03:23:46.314
FIRST OF ALL IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

03:23:46.380 --> 03:23:48.416
PEOPLE GET ACCURATE INFORMATION

03:23:48.482 --> 03:23:53.287
ABOUT- BACK CANNABIS AND- EFFECT

03:23:53.354 --> 03:23:55.556
ACTUALLY THERE THERE'S DATA TO

03:23:55.623 --> 03:23:58.759
SHOW THAT- PEOPLE. ARE NOT

03:23:58.826 --> 03:24:02.129
NECESSARILY AWARE OF- BY THE

03:24:02.196 --> 03:24:03.331
NAME OF THE ISSUES THAT AFFECT

03:24:03.397 --> 03:24:04.865
WILL RAISE BY THE WITNESSES WHO

03:24:04.932 --> 03:24:07.535
ARE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT- WE

03:24:07.602 --> 03:24:10.504
ALSO NOTE THAT- THAT BASICALLY

03:24:10.571 --> 03:24:14.175
OURSELVES. THE WARNING LABELS

03:24:14.241 --> 03:24:15.943
ENSURE THAT- WELL PROVIDE

03:24:16.010 --> 03:24:18.112
OPPORTUNITY TO BE SURE THAT THAT

03:24:18.179 --> 03:24:20.982
INFORMATION IS PUT IN IS BEFORE

03:24:21.048 --> 03:24:22.984
THE USERS IN ADDITION TO OF

03:24:23.050 --> 03:24:24.885
COURSE THEY SAID THE THEY HAND

03:24:24.952 --> 03:24:26.420
OUT WHICH GOES INTO THAT CAN GO

03:24:26.487 --> 03:24:28.556
INTO A LITTLE MORE MORE IN

03:24:28.623 --> 03:24:32.560
DEPTH- THE- L. IT THERE IS- THE

03:24:32.627 --> 03:24:34.662
REASON LABELING IS A PUT ON

03:24:34.729 --> 03:24:37.098
TOBACCO IS BECAUSE- THERE IS OUT

03:24:37.164 --> 03:24:40.501
THERE. THERE'S BEEN FOUND TO BE

03:24:40.568 --> 03:24:41.135
IN COMBINATION I THINK I SHOULD

03:24:41.202 --> 03:24:41.969
MAKE NOTE THAT IN COMBINATION

03:24:42.036 --> 03:24:43.204
WITH OTHER EFFORTS EDUCATIONAL

03:24:43.270 --> 03:24:45.606
EFFORTS IT DOES HELP- THAT SURE

03:24:45.673 --> 03:24:48.242
THAT PEOPLE ARE MORE AWARE OF

03:24:48.309 --> 03:24:51.379
THE CHALLENGES AND I WOULD POINT

03:24:51.445 --> 03:24:52.913
OUT THAT- THE WELL CERTAINLY

03:24:52.980 --> 03:24:55.816
IT'S ILLEGAL FOR SOMEONE TO SELL

03:24:55.883 --> 03:24:57.451
CANNABIS TO USE. THAT DOESN'T

03:24:57.518 --> 03:24:59.654
STOP AN ADULT FROM POTENTIALLY

03:24:59.720 --> 03:25:01.489
PURCHASING- CANNABIS THANK

03:25:01.555 --> 03:25:03.924
INCINERATING- THIS PERHAPS

03:25:03.991 --> 03:25:05.393
SHARING IT WITH SOMEONE WHO'S

03:25:05.459 --> 03:25:09.964
YOUNGER AND. THE CERTAINLY-

03:25:10.031 --> 03:25:11.532
LABEL WOULD- INDICATE- PERHAPS

03:25:11.599 --> 03:25:13.534
IT MIGHT NOT BE SUCH A GOOD

03:25:13.601 --> 03:25:14.301
IDEA- SO THAT- THEY WOULD BE

03:25:14.368 --> 03:25:16.303
AWARE OF THE OF THE RISKS THAT.

03:25:16.370 --> 03:25:18.739
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT- BUT- I

03:25:18.806 --> 03:25:20.341
THINK THAT- ACTUALLY I WOULD

03:25:20.408 --> 03:25:22.743
LIKE TO ASK- BY A TECHNICAL

03:25:22.810 --> 03:25:24.445

SPECIFICALLY- SENATOR MELENDEZ

03:25:46.434 --> 03:25:48.202
IN REGARD TO YOUR QUESTION

03:25:48.269 --> 03:25:50.037
THERE'S A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH

03:25:50.104 --> 03:25:54.141
ON WARNING LABELS- FOR TOBACCO-

03:25:54.208 --> 03:25:57.378
AND THE BALANCE OF THE EVIDENCE

03:25:57.445 --> 03:25:59.080
ON IS THE PICTORIAL WARNING

03:25:59.146 --> 03:26:01.582
LABELS ARE MORE EFFECTIVE AND

03:26:01.649 --> 03:26:03.084
THAT THESE LARGER PROMINENT OF

03:26:03.150 --> 03:26:05.219
ROTATING MESSAGES ARE MORE

03:26:05.286 --> 03:26:06.487
EFFECTIVE AT INFLUENCING

03:26:06.554 --> 03:26:08.322
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR INTENT TO

03:26:08.389 --> 03:26:11.292
CONSUME- AS WELL AS THEIR RECALL

03:26:11.358 --> 03:26:13.561
OF INFORMATION. SIMILAR STUDIES

03:26:13.627 --> 03:26:15.329
HAVE BEEN DONE FOR CANNABIS BY

03:26:15.396 --> 03:26:17.465
GROUPS FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF

03:26:17.531 --> 03:26:17.998
TORONTO DAVID HAMMOND AND

03:26:21.202 --> 03:26:22.803
FIRST PAPER THAT'S BEEN DONE

03:26:22.870 --> 03:26:24.071
WITH THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN

03:26:24.138 --> 03:26:25.673
THAT'S CURRENTLY UNDER REVIEW

03:26:25.740 --> 03:26:27.675
AND WE FOUND THE COMPARING HER

03:26:27.742 --> 03:26:30.478
IN CALIFORNIA LABELS TO THESE A

03:26:30.544 --> 03:26:31.612
STRONGER MORE PROMINENT

03:26:31.679 --> 03:26:35.416
PICTORIAL LABELS ON THE LATTER

03:26:35.483 --> 03:26:36.484
WERE. MORE EFFECTIVE- SO THERE'S

03:26:36.550 --> 03:26:38.085
A REASONABLE BODY OF EVIDENCE

03:26:38.152 --> 03:26:40.354
WHICH IS WHAT THE CASE OF

03:26:40.421 --> 03:26:41.322
TOBACCO HAS LED THE FDA TO

03:26:41.388 --> 03:26:45.359
ADOPT. THAT APPROACH- IF I COULD

03:26:45.426 --> 03:26:49.363
JUST INTERJECT HERE- THE BILL

03:26:49.430 --> 03:26:52.967
DOES NOT SUGGEST USING- GRAPHIC

03:26:53.033 --> 03:26:54.969
PICTORIAL TYPES OF WARNINGS

03:26:55.035 --> 03:27:01.609

YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT STUDIES

03:27:14.722 --> 03:27:17.758
THAT HAVE BEEN DONE RELATING TO

03:27:17.825 --> 03:27:19.260
PICTORIALS AND MORE GRAPHIC

03:27:19.326 --> 03:27:21.595
PICTURES WHICH AS I POINTED OUT

03:27:21.662 --> 03:27:23.597
IN THE IN THE DRAMA THEY'VE SAID

03:27:23.664 --> 03:27:25.499
THAT REALLY HASN'T HAD MUCH OF

03:27:25.566 --> 03:27:26.934
AN EFFECT ON PEOPLE EITHER

03:27:27.001 --> 03:27:28.702
QUITTING OR NOT STARTING IT AND

03:27:28.769 --> 03:27:30.838
IT MAKES THEM THINK ABOUT IT BUT

03:27:30.905 --> 03:27:32.640
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY EFFECT ON

03:27:32.706 --> 03:27:33.274
WHETHER THEY CONTINUE. TO ENGAGE

03:27:33.340 --> 03:27:35.042
IN THAT BEHAVIOR AND THAT'S WITH

03:54:17.810 --> 03:54:18.611
FORWARD. AND I GUESS MY

03:54:18.677 --> 03:54:20.012
QUESTIONS WERE KIND OF ON THAT

03:54:20.079 --> 03:54:21.247
SAME LINE. IT WAS MY

03:54:21.313 --> 03:54:21.947
UNDERSTANDING THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:54:22.014 --> 03:54:23.616
ALREADY DOING THIS FUNCTION. BUT

03:54:23.682 --> 03:54:24.984
WE'RE GOING TO DO NOW IS PUT

03:54:25.050 --> 03:54:27.486
SOME REQUIREMENTS ON THEM. TO

03:54:27.553 --> 03:54:28.254
GET REGISTERED TO DO THIS

03:54:28.320 --> 03:54:30.589
FUNCTION. AND SO I GUESS MY

03:54:30.656 --> 03:54:31.357
QUESTION IS IF THERE'S A LACK

03:54:31.424 --> 03:54:37.129
OF. WORK FORCE IS INCREASING-

03:54:37.196 --> 03:54:38.898
THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS.

03:54:38.964 --> 03:54:40.533
WILL THAT WOULD ACTUALLY

03:54:40.599 --> 03:54:41.901
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FOLKS WE

03:54:41.967 --> 03:54:44.670
HAVE HELPING OUT OR DECREASE IT

03:54:44.737 --> 03:54:47.440
AND- MY FIRST QUESTION A FEW

03:54:47.506 --> 03:54:49.208
QUESTIONS YEAH I THINK IT WILL

03:54:49.275 --> 03:54:51.777
INCREASE. AND WHAT IT IS IT IN

03:54:51.844 --> 03:54:54.413
STATUTE THAT IT IS NOT

03:54:54.480 --> 03:54:55.514
EXPLICITLY SHOWN HOW THE

03:54:55.581 --> 03:54:57.716
TECHNICIAN CAN PERFORM. OR EVEN

03:54:57.783 --> 03:54:59.919
IF THEY CAN. BECAUSE OF THE FACT

03:54:59.985 --> 03:55:01.754
THAT IT'S NOT LAW IN SOME OF THE

03:55:01.821 --> 03:55:03.722
OTHER STATES WE KNOW THERE IT IS

03:55:03.789 --> 03:55:05.257
LAW IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT

03:55:05.324 --> 03:55:07.860
EXPLICIT. THIS JUST BRINGS IT UP

03:55:07.927 --> 03:55:09.662
THIS SHOWS THAT USE A

03:55:09.728 --> 03:55:11.931
PSYCHOLOGIST YOU'VE BEEN IN THAT

03:55:11.997 --> 03:55:13.833
FIELD. YOU CAN HIRE YOUR

03:55:13.899 --> 03:55:17.303
TECHNICIAN TRAINING GUIDE. AND

03:55:17.369 --> 03:55:18.871
AS THEY GET CERTIFIED BY THE

03:55:18.938 --> 03:55:20.372
ASSOCIATION THEY COULD GO

03:55:20.439 --> 03:55:22.041
FORWARD WHAT THAT'S GOING TO DO

03:55:22.107 --> 03:55:24.176
IS OPEN UP DOORS FOR THOSE THAT

03:55:24.243 --> 03:55:25.711
ARE IN SCHOOL RIGHT NOW AND IN

03:55:25.778 --> 03:55:26.846
THE FUTURE. WHO HAVE BEEN

03:55:26.912 --> 03:55:28.881
STUDIED PSYCHOLOGY AND AT THE

03:55:28.948 --> 03:55:30.916
MASTERS AND SO ON TO ENTER THE

03:55:30.983 --> 03:55:33.285
FIELD AND MAYBE NOT BE THE

03:55:33.352 --> 03:55:35.855
THERAPIST 1100% BUT- OBVIOUSLY

03:55:35.921 --> 03:55:37.990
WOULD BE THE GUIDE THE EIGHT AND

03:55:38.057 --> 03:55:39.992
SO ON. AND I I'D BE OUT QUITE

03:55:40.059 --> 03:55:41.293
HONESTLY I DIDN'T REALIZE THAT

03:55:41.360 --> 03:55:44.230
THE TESTING WOULD GO ON SO LONG.

03:55:44.296 --> 03:55:46.499
WHERE THAT PSYCHOLOGIST COULD BE

03:55:46.565 --> 03:55:48.400
ALREADY WORKING WITH THE PATIENT

03:55:48.467 --> 03:55:50.102
BUT THERE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME

03:55:50.169 --> 03:55:52.438
REVIEWING AND- LOOKING AT THE

03:55:52.505 --> 03:55:54.206
DOCUMENTS. WHERE THAT TECHNICIAN

03:55:54.273 --> 03:55:56.275
COULD HAVE JUST SAT THERE AND

03:55:56.342 --> 03:55:57.643
INTERVIEWED QUESTION AFTER

TURNED OVER THE RESULTS TO BE

03:56:01.180 --> 03:56:02.982
ANALYZED AND THEN IN TURN. THE

03:56:03.048 --> 03:56:04.750
PSYCHOLOGIST MEET ONE ON ONE

03:56:04.817 --> 03:56:06.252
WITH THE PATIENT AND WHERE THEY

03:56:06.318 --> 03:56:08.053
ARE DOING ONE OR TWO A DAY NOW

03:56:08.120 --> 03:56:10.356
THAT WOULD IT GO BUT OPEN UP

03:56:10.422 --> 03:56:11.257
MORE. IN BECAUSE THE VA IS

03:56:11.323 --> 03:56:13.292
ALREADY DOING THIS ISSUE TELLS

03:56:13.359 --> 03:56:16.328
ME THAT THERE'S ROOM FOR MORE

03:56:16.395 --> 03:56:17.329
AND THIS WILL JUST CLEAR UP

03:56:17.396 --> 03:56:19.665
THAT. VAGUENESS ABOUT IT BEING

03:56:19.732 --> 03:56:25.204
LEGALLY. ABLE TO BE DONE IN

03:56:25.271 --> 03:56:26.238

PERFORMING THIS FUNCTION AS I

03:56:30.943 --> 03:56:32.878
UNDERSTAND IT. BUT THE LAW IS

03:56:32.945 --> 03:56:35.514
SILENT ON IT SO NOW WE'RE GONNA.

03:56:35.581 --> 03:56:36.715
WE'RE GONNA. WE'RE GONNA CREATE

03:56:36.782 --> 03:56:39.385
A LAW AND THEREBY ALSO CREATE

03:56:39.451 --> 03:56:42.621
THE SUPERVISION AND- THE

CENTER CALLS WERE AS- WITH THE

03:57:14.987 --> 03:57:16.155
CALIFORNIA PSYCHOLOGICAL

03:57:16.221 --> 03:57:18.190
ASSOCIATION SO THIS IS SOMETHING

03:57:18.257 --> 03:57:19.625
WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN WORKING ON

03:57:19.692 --> 03:57:21.660
WITH THE BOARD OF PSYCHOLOGY ON

03:57:21.727 --> 03:57:22.995
TO THE FIRST PART YOUR QUESTION

03:57:23.062 --> 03:57:24.964
THAT'S A GREAT POINT- WE DON'T

03:57:25.030 --> 03:57:26.732
ACTUALLY TRACK WHO IS DOING THIS

03:57:26.799 --> 03:57:29.168

ACTUALLY TRACKED INFORMATION WE

03:57:36.575 --> 03:57:38.143
DON'T HAVE ANYTHING MORE THAN

03:57:38.210 --> 03:57:39.678
ANECDOTAL WE KNOW. THAT SOME VA

03:57:39.745 --> 03:57:41.847

03:57:41.914 --> 03:57:43.349
SOME YEARS IN ACADEMIC SETTINGS

03:57:43.415 --> 03:57:44.984
BUT AS TERMS OF WIDESPREAD USE

03:57:45.050 --> 03:57:47.286
WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT TO BE THE

03:57:47.353 --> 03:57:48.654
CASE- I AS THE SECOND POINT WE

03:57:48.721 --> 03:57:50.089

AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS MAKE OF

03:58:06.472 --> 03:58:07.840
LICENSEES- BUT ALSO ESTABLISHING

03:58:07.906 --> 03:58:09.441
A PROCESS BY WHICH INDIVIDUALS

STATES- MAY HAVE AN INTAKE

03:58:14.780 --> 03:58:15.981
PROCESS SO THEY CAN ALSO

SEVERAL YEARS ON THIS ITEM

03:59:53.612 --> 03:59:55.714
INTERNALLY- WE DON'T KNOW OF

03:59:55.781 --> 03:59:56.815

THE USAGE OF THESE TECHNICIANS

04:00:21.273 --> 04:00:22.741
IS WE DON'T SEE AS BEING

04:00:22.808 --> 04:00:25.010
PERMITTED UNDER THE LAW- I DON'T

04:00:25.077 --> 04:00:26.979
KNOW IF THERE ARE OTHERS WHO DO

04:00:27.045 --> 04:00:29.181
USED TECHNICIANS- IF THAT

04:00:29.248 --> 04:00:31.016
INFORMATION IS OUT THERE IT'S

04:00:31.083 --> 04:00:32.084

TECHNICIANS. WITH THE FACT THAT

04:00:38.090 --> 04:00:39.391
YOU DON'T COLLECTED DOESN'T MEAN

04:00:39.458 --> 04:00:40.993
THAT THEY'RE NOT IN USE CORRECT.

04:00:41.059 --> 04:00:43.028
IT IS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE CENTER I

04:00:43.095 --> 04:00:43.962
CAN'T SPEAK TO ALL THE

04:00:44.029 --> 04:00:45.664
PRACTICING PSYCHOLOGISTS HOWEVER

I WILL SAY THE FOLKS IN OUR

04:00:47.633 --> 04:00:49.067
NEUROPSYCHOLOGY DIVISION OF

04:00:49.134 --> 04:00:50.803
WHICH- DOCUMENT MULLIN IS A

04:00:50.869 --> 04:00:53.071
MEMBER- WE DO NOT KNOW OF ANYONE

04:00:53.138 --> 04:00:55.274
WHO IS ACTIVELY. THESE FOLKS

04:00:55.340 --> 04:00:59.778
WITHIN THE PRACTICE. WITHIN THE

04:00:59.845 --> 04:01:01.880
LAST AT LEAST HALF DECADE. SO

04:01:01.947 --> 04:01:03.215
WITH RESPECT TRANSACTION

04:01:03.282 --> 04:01:06.218
EDUCATION. GO AHEAD PLEASE

04:01:06.285 --> 04:01:08.287
STEPANEK FALLING APART I JUST

04:01:08.353 --> 04:01:10.455
WANTED TO JUMP IN THE YOU KNOW

04:01:10.522 --> 04:01:11.824
CONTRAST THIS WITH HOW THINGS IN

04:01:11.890 --> 04:01:14.092
OTHER STATES IF IT WAS IF I AND

04:01:14.159 --> 04:01:15.994
MY COLLEAGUES VIEWED US AS BEING

04:01:16.061 --> 04:01:18.297
ACCEPTABLE FROM THE BY THE BOARD

04:01:18.363 --> 04:01:20.833
AND LEGAL- I WOULD ALREADY BE

04:01:20.899 --> 04:01:23.635
USING ONE- WHEN I WAS IN ANOTHER

04:01:23.702 --> 04:01:25.470
STATE I WAS USING ONE IT MAKES

04:01:25.537 --> 04:01:26.905
THE PRACTICE SO MUCH MORE

04:01:26.972 --> 04:01:28.040
EFFICIENT BUT IT'S HIGHLY

04:01:28.106 --> 04:01:30.142
DESIRABLE THAT WE COULD USE ONE.

04:01:30.209 --> 04:01:32.477
BUT IN CALIFORNIA IT'S- IT'S

04:01:32.544 --> 04:01:35.747
CLEAR THAT- AT LEAST THE-PERCEPTION ON WHAT WE'VE BEEN

04:01:35.814 --> 04:01:37.015
TOLD BY REPORTERS THIS IS NOT

04:01:37.082 --> 04:01:40.886
SOMETHING THAT- IT IS- IS TO BE

04:01:40.953 --> 04:01:42.521
DONE IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S

04:01:42.588 --> 04:01:46.325
WHY WE NEED TO CLARIFICATION ON.

04:01:46.391 --> 04:01:47.793
IT WILL JUST NEED TO SCALE

04:01:47.860 --> 04:01:50.462
HERE'S MY HERE'S MY PROBLEM I

04:01:50.529 --> 04:01:53.198
HAVE A PROBLEM WITH USING THE

04:01:53.265 --> 04:02:00.639
LICENSE REGISTRATION.

04:02:00.706 --> 04:02:01.607
RECOGNITION PROCESS. WHERE IT'S

04:02:01.673 --> 04:02:02.841
NOT AB REQUIRE BECAUSE IS THE

04:02:02.908 --> 04:02:05.277
ANALYSIS OF DATA. AND I FOR

04:02:05.344 --> 04:02:06.111
BELIEVE. THESE RULES THAT WE PUT

04:02:06.178 --> 04:02:08.680
IN PLACE- CAN SERVE AS A BARRIER

04:02:08.747 --> 04:02:10.015
TO EMPLOYMENT AND THEY'RE A

04:02:10.082 --> 04:02:12.818
BARRIER TO EMPLOYMENT. VERY MUCH

04:02:12.885 --> 04:02:14.686
FOR THE FOR THE PIECES IN

04:02:14.753 --> 04:02:16.221
PORTIONS OF THE POPULATION THAT

04:02:16.288 --> 04:02:18.223
WE OFTEN CARED THE MOST AND

04:02:18.290 --> 04:02:20.325
FIGHT THE MOST FOR. HERE IN THIS

04:02:20.392 --> 04:02:21.860
FLOOR THE DISADVANTAGED AND

04:02:21.927 --> 04:02:24.129
THOSE WHO COME. FROM COMMUNITIES

04:02:24.196 --> 04:02:27.766
OF COLOR. AND SO I REALLY TAKE A

04:02:27.833 --> 04:02:29.601
LOOK AT THESE REQUIREMENTS IN

04:02:29.668 --> 04:02:31.803
THESE REQUESTS FOR REGISTRATION

04:02:31.870 --> 04:02:33.906
OR RECOGNITION. OF VERY

04:02:33.972 --> 04:02:36.041
SERIOUSLY FOR EXAMPLE THE

04:02:36.108 --> 04:02:36.942
REQUIREMENT FOR A BACHELOR'S

04:02:37.009 --> 04:02:39.778
DEGREE WAS THAT YOU ALL ARE

AND HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS WAS

04:02:43.448 --> 04:02:45.784
THAT VALIDATED IN SOME WAY BY A

04:02:45.851 --> 04:02:49.054
STUDY. IN OTHER WORDS WHAT TASKS

04:02:49.121 --> 04:02:51.223
ARE THESE TESTING TAX GOING TO

04:02:51.290 --> 04:02:54.860
PERFORM. THAT WOULD REQUIRE

04:02:54.927 --> 04:02:57.429
NECESSARILY A BACHELOR'S DEGREE

04:02:57.496 --> 04:03:01.566
IN PSYCHOLOGY AND IS IT A DEGREE

04:03:01.633 --> 04:03:02.834
IN SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY IS IT A

04:03:02.901 --> 04:03:04.770
DEGREE AND- IN THE OTHER

04:03:04.836 --> 04:03:06.071
DISCIPLINES WITHIN THE

04:03:06.138 --> 04:03:12.878
PSYCHOLOGY FIELD AND IF SO WHY.

04:03:12.945 --> 04:03:15.314
MISTER MISTER CHAIRMAN GO AHEAD-

04:03:15.380 --> 04:03:19.451
DOCUMENT MULLIN. I WOULD SAY

04:03:19.518 --> 04:03:21.954
THAT AND THE REASON THAT TAX IN

04:03:22.020 --> 04:03:23.021
THERE IS THAT SOMETHING THAT

04:03:23.088 --> 04:03:24.222
SORT OF STANDARD ACROSS THE

04:03:24.289 --> 04:03:25.624
COUNTRY THEN IT'S BEEN

04:03:25.691 --> 04:03:28.493
RECOMMENDED BY OUR PROFESSIONAL

04:03:28.560 --> 04:03:29.928
ORGANIZATIONS SUCH AS THE

04:03:29.995 --> 04:03:31.863
NATIONAL ECONOMY AND KNOWS THE

04:03:31.930 --> 04:03:34.266
COLLEGES THAT- ACTUALLY

04:03:34.333 --> 04:03:35.934
TECHNICIANS ARE HAVE A

04:03:36.001 --> 04:03:37.669
BACHELOR'S DEGREE AND BE TRAINED

04:03:37.736 --> 04:03:39.404
UP BY THE PSYCHOLOGY I THINK

04:03:39.471 --> 04:03:41.640
YOU'RE A STRAPLESS THING- YOU

04:03:41.707 --> 04:03:42.441
KNOW SENATE MINIMUM

04:03:42.507 --> 04:03:45.477
QUALIFICATIONS AND- YOU KNOW I

04:03:45.544 --> 04:03:51.183
DON'T SEE IT. AS A BARRIER TO

04:03:51.249 --> 04:03:51.950
OUR- HI THIS IS THE BILL

04:03:52.017 --> 04:03:53.952
ACTUALLY ON- LIKE TO THE NUMBER

04:03:54.019 --> 04:03:55.320
OF JOBS IN. HEALTH BECAUSE IT'LL

04:03:55.387 --> 04:03:57.622
BE MORE PEOPLE THIS THIS POINT.

04:03:57.689 --> 04:03:58.991
IF THERE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE

04:03:59.057 --> 04:04:00.692
USING TACTIC TESTING TECHNICIANS

04:04:00.759 --> 04:04:02.327
ADDITION A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE

04:04:02.394 --> 04:04:04.596
OF WHAT WILL BE AND WHAT WILL

04:04:04.663 --> 04:04:07.265
END UP HAPPENING IF- IF AND

04:04:07.332 --> 04:04:09.501
WHEN. THE BILL PASSES AND LOOKED

04:04:09.568 --> 04:04:10.669
IN THE STATUS OF TESTING

04:04:10.736 --> 04:04:12.637
TECHNICIANS IS CLARIFIED BECAUSE

04:04:12.704 --> 04:04:14.206
WITH DISAPPOINTING. YOU KNOW I

04:04:14.272 --> 04:04:16.408
WOULD. MENTION CLARIFIED I WOULD

04:04:16.475 --> 04:04:20.379
DEFINITELY- YOU KNOW ADVERTISED.

04:04:20.445 --> 04:04:21.513
TO HIRE IS TESTING TECHNICIAN I

04:04:21.580 --> 04:04:23.348
WOULD GET FROM MY EMPLOYER TO DO

04:04:23.415 --> 04:04:24.983
SO I'M AND I THINK A LOT OF

04:04:25.050 --> 04:04:27.152
PLACES WHERE THERE'S JUST A MUCH

04:04:27.219 --> 04:04:27.886
MORE EFFICIENT WAY OF DOING

04:04:27.953 --> 04:04:29.821
BUSINESS AND SO I THINK IT WOULD

04:04:29.888 --> 04:04:31.056
GENERALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

04:04:31.123 --> 04:04:32.958
PEOPLE. DOING THIS WORK WELL YOU

04:04:33.025 --> 04:04:35.360
KNOW IN THE EMPLOYMENT FIELD.

04:04:35.427 --> 04:04:36.528
FIFTY PRETTY CAREFUL ABOUT HOW

04:04:36.595 --> 04:04:39.064
WE SET QUALIFICATIONS BECAUSE IF

04:04:39.131 --> 04:04:41.633
YOU SET THE QUALIFICATION OF A

04:04:41.700 --> 04:04:43.568
BACHELOR'S DEGREE FOR EXAMPLE.

04:04:43.635 --> 04:04:45.370
WITHOUT DIRECTLY TYING IT TO THE

04:04:45.437 --> 04:04:46.905
SKILLS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO DO

04:04:46.972 --> 04:04:48.907
THE JOB. THAT'S A PROBLEM

04:04:48.974 --> 04:04:50.609
BECAUSE AT LEAST HISTORICALLY IT

04:04:50.675 --> 04:04:58.316
TENDS TO DISCRIMINATE. AGAINST

04:04:58.383 --> 04:04:59.051
MINORITIES AND PEOPLE OF COLOR.

04:04:59.117 --> 04:05:00.752
AND THAT'S WHY AS MIKE. WITH

04:05:00.819 --> 04:05:02.020
RESPECT TO YOUR BROTHER DEGREE

04:05:02.087 --> 04:05:03.422
