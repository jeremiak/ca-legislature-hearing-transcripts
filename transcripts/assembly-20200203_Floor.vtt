REPUBLICANS HAVEN'T OPPOSE ON

00:42:57.608 --> 00:42:59.743
THIS POSITION I WOULD KNOW THAT

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:01.011
IT IS IN FACT THE REPUBLICAN

00:43:01.078 --> 00:43:02.012
PARTY THAT REQUIRES PEOPLE TO

00:43:02.079 --> 00:43:04.148

00:43:11.755 --> 00:43:13.524
PRIMARY I DURING THE SELECTION

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:16.593
WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:21.932
FOR MY VOTE. IN YOU MISS OUT.

00:43:21.999 --> 00:43:24.401
MR KILEY WERE. THINK ABOUT AS

00:43:24.468 --> 00:43:26.070
BIG I I'M IN SOME OF BILL I

00:43:26.136 --> 00:43:27.037
THINK THAT CONCERN THE BEEN RAY

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:30.140
ABOUT VOTER FRAUD ARE NOT A

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:31.041
SERIOUS IN THIS IS A SO OTHERS

00:43:31.108 --> 00:43:32.443
I THINK ANY ELECTION OFFICE I

00:43:32.509 --> 00:43:33.777
CAN EASILY AVOID DOUBLE

00:43:33.844 --> 00:43:34.979
COUNTING VOTES BY SIMPLY

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:37.147
INVALIDATING ANY ABSENTEE

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:37.982
BALLOT THAT COMES IN FOR

00:43:38.048 --> 00:43:40.517
SOMEONE WHO IS ALREADY VOTED ON

00:43:40.584 --> 00:43:42.753
ELECTION DAY THE BENEFIT SEE TO

00:43:42.820 --> 00:43:43.921
THIS BATTLE IS IT SOME MINOR

00:43:43.988 --> 00:43:45.789
IMPROVEMENTS A PROBLEM IN OUR

00:43:45.856 --> 00:43:47.658
STATE THAT I BELIEVE HAS BECOME

00:43:47.725 --> 00:43:49.026
QUITE SEVERE AND THAT'S THE

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:50.728
PROTRACTED. NATURE BOTH OF

00:43:50.794 --> 00:43:53.731
BEING AN ACCOUNT EACH OF WHICH

00:43:53.797 --> 00:43:56.600
ALLOW THIRTY DAYS BEFORE AND

00:43:56.667 --> 00:43:58.402
AFTER ELECTION DAY IN

00:43:58.469 --> 00:44:00.404
CALIFORNIA I BECOME

00:44:00.471 --> 00:44:02.439
INCREASINGLY CONCERNED THAT

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:04.108
THIS RAISES SERIOUS ISSUES

00:44:04.174 --> 00:44:07.011
AROUND DEMOCRATIC LEGITIMACY I

00:44:07.077 --> 00:44:10.981
JUST LOOK MOST DRAMATIC EXAMPLE

00:44:11.048 --> 00:44:11.615
OF THE ON GOING ENSURE BASE WE

00:44:11.682 --> 00:44:13.217
HAVE SOME VOTING START THIS

00:44:13.283 --> 00:44:17.955
WEEK. TO CONTINUE VOTE IN UP

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.690
AND EARLY PART ABOUT THAT GOING

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:21.492
TO HAVE. IN THAT TIMES FOR YOUR

00:44:21.558 --> 00:44:22.359
HAVE CANNOT DROP OUT OF THE

00:44:22.426 --> 00:44:23.394
RIGHT. SO PEOPLE WILL BE. IN

00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:25.496
LITERALLY DE ELECTIONS YET

00:44:25.562 --> 00:44:27.331
THOUGH JUST BE ONE SINGLE TALLY

00:44:27.398 --> 00:44:28.866
ALTHOUGH THAT TALLY WILL NOT BE

00:44:28.932 --> 00:44:30.868
FINALIZED UNTIL WEEKS AFTER

00:44:30.934 --> 00:44:32.903
ELECTION DAY EVEN THOUGH ON

00:44:32.970 --> 00:44:34.171
ELECTION NIGHT YOU'RE GONNA

00:44:34.238 --> 00:44:35.439
HAVE SOME REPORTING AS TO WHO'S

00:44:35.506 --> 00:44:36.874
AHEAD. AND THAT MAY WELL BE

00:44:36.940 --> 00:44:38.409
DIFFERENT THAN THE PERSON WHO

00:44:38.475 --> 00:44:40.277
ULTIMATELY HAS A LEAD ONCE ALL

00:44:40.344 --> 00:44:42.012
THE BALLOTS HAVE BEEN COUNTED

00:44:42.079 --> 00:44:43.480
WE DON'T KNOW IN PRESIDENTIAL

00:44:43.547 --> 00:44:45.516
PRIMARIES THINGS LIKE MOMENTUM

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:47.251
AND NARRATIVES OFTEN MATTER

00:44:47.317 --> 00:44:48.318
MORE THAN THE ACTUAL

00:44:48.385 --> 00:44:49.753
ASSIGNMENTS. OF DELEGATES SO

00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:50.754
ARE VOTE COUNTING SYSTEM

00:44:50.821 --> 00:44:52.456
CREATES THIS POTENTIAL TO SORT

00:44:52.523 --> 00:44:54.525
OF SKEW ELECTION OUTCOMES-

00:44:54.591 --> 00:44:55.492
THROUGH FALSE NARRATIVES AND

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:57.061
FALSE MOMENTUM SO I THINK THIS

00:44:57.127 --> 00:44:58.929
BILL WILL HELP A LITTLE BIT. BY

00:44:58.996 --> 00:45:00.264
ALLOWING MORE PEOPLE TO VOTE ON

00:45:00.330 --> 00:45:02.199
ELECTION DAY AND ASSURING THOSE

00:45:02.266 --> 00:45:04.601
BALLOTS ARE COUNTED ON THAT DAY

00:45:04.668 --> 00:45:06.770
RATHER THAN SET ASIDE AS

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:07.971
PROVISIONALS ALTHOUGH I THINK

00:45:08.038 --> 00:45:09.506
WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO ON

00:45:09.573 --> 00:45:11.608
WINE. THE MASS ARE ELECTIONS

00:45:11.675 --> 00:45:15.712
CODE HAS MADE AND MOVED BACK

00:45:15.779 --> 00:45:20.050
TOWARDS THE DEMOCRATIC IDEAL OF

00:45:20.117 --> 00:45:23.854
ELECTIONS. I OUT ONCE AND OUR

00:45:23.921 --> 00:45:24.455
