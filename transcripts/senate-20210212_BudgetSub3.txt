QUESTIONS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT FUNDING SUMMARY- UNDER REIMBURSEMENTS- OH NINE NINE FIVE- BUT NICK MAKE NOTE IS THAT THE- TWENTY TWENTY ONE. REVISED IS ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS BUT THE PROPOSED TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO GOES BACK DOWN. I GUESS BACK TO THE BASE LINE WHICH WE HAD BETWEEN NINETEEN. TWENTY TO TWO BY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION. CAN YOU JUST GIVE ME A BRIEF EXPLANATION AS TO WHAT THE- RICE I CAN SORT OF GUESS BUT- I DON'T I GUESS I JUST WANNA KNOW WHAT THE- SO WHEN UP TO SEVEN FOURTEEN. MILLION A HUNDRED MILLION. BACK DOWN TO BEING PROPOSED FOR TWO HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE MILLION WHAT THIS REIMBURSEMENT IS AN IS THAT. DO WE REALLY EXPECTED TO DROP THAT MUCH AGAIN SINCE I WELL AS I SHOULD ASSUME WHAT THE REIMBURSEMENT IS AYE. ITS BIGGEST CODE RELATED BUT WE'RE STILL INCOME IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE- SO- I HAVE I HAVE RATED NUDISM. HE CAN GIVE YOU A WANNA MAKE SURE GIVING OUR- RISK. BRANDON OKAY YOU.

G. GRANT CALIFORNIA RECEIVED ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION. I THINK MOST OF THAT IS GOING TO BE COMING- FOR LOCAL ASSISTANT BEGINNING TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUT- BUT THAT'S WHERE YOU'RE SEEN THAT CAN ARISE IN REIMBURSEMENT THIS PRIMARILY THROUGH THAT AT THE IN LAP ABOUT THE GRANT THAT OKAY SO I GUESS MY THEN THE QUESTION IS THAT FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE PURPOSE. BECAUSE IT LOOKS YOU PUT IN ALL THESE FOR MARKER CENTURY BACK DOWN TO BASE- IS- AND THEN AGAIN WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE MIGHT GET- AND IN THAT TIME IS A GUESS IS THERE GONNA BE A REVISION IN MAY TWO BETTER PROJECT WHAT WE MIGHT BE A RECEIVING IN REGARDS TO- TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO STARTING JULY OR ARE WE JUST GONNA CENTER AND THIS IS JAX WEALTH IN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- WE WILL BE REVIEWING AVAIL SEVERAL RESOURCES ARE PROVIDE.

ALL RIGHT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATE EXPLANATION. THANK THURMOND IS. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR- I'D WOULD LIKE TO COME OUT FOR ME- ACTIVITIES THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAS HAD TO PUSH ASIDE BECAUSE OF THE FOCUS THAT HAS HAD BEEN PLACED ON KOPET. I KNOW THAT CURRENTLY OUR DEPARTMENT RIGHT NOW HE IS COMPILING THAT INFORMATION- I DON'T HAVE A TEAM I DON'T HAVE IT AT THE MOMENT BUT THAT'S SOMETHING WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO YOU AS SOON AS IT'S READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE NOTE THERE ARE SEVEN MAJOR DEPARTMENTS- THAT COMPRISED. PUBLIC HEALTH MAJOR AT THEM. AND I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION WHAT ARE WE MISSING AS WERE AS WE'RE GOING FULL FORCE ON THE PANDEMIC. OKAY AFTER WE WELCOME YOU DR GONE TO THE THANK YOU TO THIS TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THIS CONVERSATION. AND I THINK WE CAN MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO AND ACTUALLY TALK ABOUT THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. CAN YOU HEAR ME YES GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME. GOOD MORNING SENATORS- THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR- THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTED A MANY OF DR ERIC UPON I AM THE STATE EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASES- SO THIS MORNING I'LL START WITH- THE REQUEST FOR AN OVERVIEW OF OUR CURRENT CASE RATES HOSPITALIZATIONS AND MORTALITY STATISTICS FOR CALIFORNIA- WE ARE AT JUST OVER THREE POINT THREE MILLION CASES- ABOUT TEN THOUSAND. NEW CASES TODAY ARE- DALY CASE RIGHT OR SEVEN DAY AVERAGES AROUND TWENTY SIX POINT FIVE AND- ALL OF THESE TRENDS ARE OF THINK THE DECREASING- OVER THE LAST SEVERAL WEEKS- WE HAVE A SEVEN DAY TEST POSITIVITY OF FOUR POINT 3% WHICH IS ALSO IMPROVING OVER TIME- AS FAR AS OUR HOSPITALIZATIONS- ARE STATEWIDE HOSPITAL SEVENTY HOURS OF NEW ADMISSIONS WHICH IS SOMETHING WE'RE WATCHING VERY CLOSELY HAS. DECREASED BY ALMOST TWENTY FOUR PERCENT. AND THEN THE CODE POSITIVE PATIENTS AND HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN ARE JUST ABOVE 50% OF WHAT THEY WERE AT THE PEAK OF OUR SEARCH JUST OVER THE HOLIDAY SEASON SO- HUSTLER DEFINITELY DECOMPRESSING AND I SEE YOU IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT SLOWER. TO DECOMPRESS WE HAVE ABOUT 62% OF THE PATIENTS AND I SEE YOU COMPARED TO THE PEAK. OF THE SURGE BUT DEFINITELY ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS- SO WE'RE SEEING VERY ENCOURAGING TRENDS AS FAR AS THAT- AS FAR AS MENTALITY. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF DEATHS IS- JUST OVER FORTY SIX THOUSAND AND THAT IS DEFINITELY A LAGGING INDICATOR SO WE'LL CONTINUE TO SEE- REPORTS SOMETIMES THESE ARE- SIXTY WEEKS EVEN OF- DATES OF. PAST DATES OF DEATH I WANT TO POINT OUT ACTUALLY THAT WE ARE- ARE KEY STRAIGHT THOUGH I MEAN OUR DEATH RATE PER CAPITA IS A HUNDRED THIRTEEN PER HUNDRED THOUSAND WHICH IS ONE OF THE LOWEST PER CAPITA DEATHS AMONGST THE LARGE STATES. SOMETHING I THINK WE SHOULD BE PROUD OF IS A STATE. FOR HOW WELL WE HAVE DONE THEIR- AND THEN KIND OF MOVE FOR ON- SORT OF AN OVER OF THE STRATEGIES THAT WE HAVE- HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT OUR STATE'S TO FROM RISK FOR CO NINETEEN SO OUR OVERALL NAY. RELATED TO THIS IS A THE AND HEALTH INCOME WHILE BELL THEM OF HOW SOCIETY ECONOMY. SO THERE SEVEN STRESS ARE OF A BUCKET WE THINK ABOUT IS OUR STRATEGY SO WE WON OF COURSE AN INCREDIBLY ONE THAT I JUST HIGHLIGHTED WAS MONITORING THE SCOPE AND THE PROGRESS ND PANDEMIC TO INFORM THE SPONSOR OF THE SURVEILLANCE IS THE DAY THAT I JUST MENTIONED- ALSO INCLUDING MODELING AND PROJECTIONS ARE AS YOU WELL KNOW WE'VE- BEEN LOOKING AT ICE YOU CAPACITY IN PROJECTING THAT FORWARD PROTECTING HOSPITAL CAPACITY FOR REALLY HELPS AS WITH PLANNING AND RESPONSE AND RESOURCES- AS WELL AS THINKING ABOUT ONE. ONE NON PHARMACEUTICAL INTERVENTIONS TO RECOMMEND- WE ALSO DO A LOT OF ANALYSIS OF OUR DATA AND- REALLY IS YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE DISPARATE IMPACTS OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS HIGHLIGHTED AS FAR AS THE INEQUITIES- AND REALLY TRYING TO PROVIDE METRICS AND INDICATORS TO MONITOR AND ADDRESS THOSE THINGS- AND THEN REALLY- REALLY CRUCIAL TO ALL THOSE WHICH OF COURSE ISN'T HIGHLIGHTED THROUGHOUT THIS PANDEMIC IS HOW. IMPORTANT FOR DATA THE I. T. SYSTEMS ARE SO- MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO RISE UP AND THAT IS GOING TO BE A THEME CERTAINLY AROUND THIS RESPONSE AND MY DISCUSSION OF THAT OF OUR SECOND STRATEGY OF COURSE IS DEVELOPING A POLICIES THAT THEN YOU KNOW OUR INFORMED ABOUT IT BY THAT DATA AND SUPPORT THIS MISSION SO PROVIDING A SCIENCE BASED EVIDENCE BASED FRAMEWORK FOR US A FREE OPENING OF THE ECONOMY TO MINIMIZE THESE HEALTH IMPACTS- SO EVERYTHING WE'VE DONE TO DEVELOP THE BLUEPRINTS- FURCIFER. WITH THE TEARS ALSO DEVELOPING ALL THE SAFE- SORT OF GUIDELINES AND PROTOCOLS AND DIRECTIVES WE HAVE RELATED TO DIFFERENT SETTINGS INCLUDING SCHOOLS. REOPENING AND OF A PRODDING AT GROUPON. AND ON- WE WANT OF COURSE ALLOW. ALL OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTHCARE POLICIES ACTION WITH CHANGING. IN OF PENN. WHICH BEEN RAPIDLY CHANGING OVER THE ENTIRE AT NOW SIR. MY I THINK WE'RE ARE IN THIS AND THEN I. THE THIRD STRATEGY IS- MITIGATE AND SUPPRESSING COME NINETEEN SO MID. BY AGAIN DIRECTING PREVENT EFFORTS AND NONE OF OUR IS STILL GOING- TO MINIMIZE THE- HEALTH. OF THINGS THAT YOU KNOW THE MORE EXTREME IN THE OF COURSE IS A STATE ORDER. MASKING ALL OF THOSE IN. NOT PHARMACEUTICAL. AND THEN SUPPRESSING AND CONTAINMENT IS REALLY ABOUT TO FOR PROVIDING SUPPORT AND RESOURCES TO OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHO ARE THEN DOING THE CASE DETECTION WHICH IS TESTING- WE'LL TALK A LOT MORE ABOUT LABORATORY PASSED IN TESTING THE NEXT QUESTION- AND THEN ONCE YOU DETECT THIS CASE IS YOU HAVE TO INVESTIGATE THEM AND THEN YOU DO CONTACT TRACING AND THEN. ISOLATION AND QUARANTINE SO ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS ARE JUST PRESSING CONTAINS SPECIALLY WHEN THEIR CASE NUMBERS ON LOTTO. AND THAT REALLY IS THROUGH THE ARMS OF OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PARTNERS THE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH RESTRICTIONS. AGAIN A LOT OF IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT THAT AND THE NEXT QUESTION. AND THEN OUR ROLE THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT IS HEALTH PROVIDE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR OUTBREAK CONTROL- ESPECIALLY IN OUR STATE HOSPITALS AND A LOT OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY HOMES WE HAVE A LARGE HEALTH CARE SAYS INFECTION PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES THAT TA- SO GET ALL THE HIGHER SETTING SUCH AS- THE NURSING FACILITIES CORRECTIONAL FACILITIES WORKPLACES SCHOOLS AND OTHER COMMUNITY SETTINGS AS WELL SO WE PROVIDE THAT TA TO THE LOCAL DEPARTMENTS AND ALSO HELP COURTNEY WHEN THERE'S A MULTI JURISDICTIONAL OUTBREAK- WE ALSO. YOU KNOW WORK TO DEVELOP% AND PROVIDE INNOVATIVE AND EQUITABLE SOLUTION FOR CHANGING THE. COURSE THE PENTAX. AND THEN THE OTHER THE STREET- IS COORDINATING ITS OPERATING. THE STATE WHAT KERRY. AND PHARMACY AND- SO. OF COURSE THE BIGGEST. RIGHT NOW WHICH- AN- ANOTHER QUESTION WHERE WILL- DIVE DEEPER AND THIS IS. PROVIDING AN EQUITABLE THE NINETEEN VACCINE IS. PLAN AND THAT. CAL BASED ON THE SUPPLY- AND THEN ALSO ALLOCATING. GOVERNMENT'S ANTI VIRAL AND ANTIBODY TREATMENTS WHICH ARE STILL AN ONGOING. ACTIVITY AND THEN REALLY IMPORTANT ESPECIALLY DURING THIS LAST SURGE- AND THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN MONITORING AND SUPPORTING THE HEALTHCARE SEARCH SO WE HAVE DEPLOYED. THOUSANDS OF STAFF ACROSS THE STATE TO HELP WITH SEARCH- THE SURGE CLINICAL CARE- WE IMPLEMENTED A HEALTHCARE SEARCH ORDER TO ENSURE WE HELP LEVEL ACROSS HOSPITALS MAJOR ELECTIVE SURGERIES WERE CANCELED. MAKE SURE THAT HOUSEHOLDS ACCEPT TRANSFERS SO THAT WE DIDN'T HAVE INEQUITIES AND BETWEEN HOSPITALS AND IN THE REGIONS. AND WE WERE ABLE TO AVOID CRISIS CENTERS OF CARE AND THE STATE BY DOING THAT- THERE ALSO STOPPING WAIVERS AND OTHER THINGS LIKE THAT THAT- YOU KNOW HELP AGAIN TO. TO MODERATE THE IMPACT. AND AGAIN WE USING OUR DATA. TO INFORM PLANNING WITH PROJECTIONS- ALL PROVIDE YOU KNOW LOT OF FOR PROTECT EQUIPMENT OVER THIS MONTHS- THAT- I. AND- NO ACTUALLY ALSO TECHNO ASSISTANCE HELP WITH- OLDER HOUSES THAT NEED MORE ACTION TIME AND- A LOT OF LOCAL STRIKE TEAM WHEN NEEDED FOR HEALTH CARE. SERVICE SUPPORT AND BACK TO THAT. AND THE- AND ENHANCE INFECTION PRO. AND THESE HEALTH FACILITY SETTINGS AGAIN FROM TECH ASSISTANCE SPARE. AND OF COURSE A REALLY STRETCH IS COMING. OF TO THE PUBLIC AND ENGAGING ALL DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS- INCLUDING OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND COMMUNICATING FREQUENTLY AND- TO RIGHT UP TO DATE CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SCIENCE BASED AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND INFORMATION. AND ACCESSIBLE FORMATS AND LANGUAGES ABOUT THE STATUS OF THE PANDEMIC TRANSMISSION AND KEY RESPONSE INTERVENTION ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO- REALLY AGAIN AS ONE OF OUR CORE. VALUES INCREASE AWARENESS ABOUT THE DISPARITIES IN DISEASE IMPACTING COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COME IN NINETEEN AND WE DESIGNED TARGETED PUBLIC EDUCATION CAMPAIGNS FOR THESE GROUPS. AND THEN THE LAST TWO AND STRATEGIES GO HAND IN HAND WHICH IS PARTICIPATING IN A COORDINATED STATE GOVERNMENT AND ALL OF GOVERNMENT ALL THE STATE APPROACH REALLY TO MOBILIZE YOU KNOW THIS IS A- ONCE IN A LIFETIME PANDEMIC AT LEAST WE HOPE- AND REALLY NEEDS ALL HANDS ON DECK SO. WE'VE BEEN WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH ALL OF OUR STATE AGENCIES IN APARTMENTS AND- A LOT OF DIFFERENT PUBLIC AND PRIVATE- PARTNERS AND OF COURSE AGAIN PARTY WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO SIXTY ONE JURISDICTIONS ACROSS THE STATE AND BUILDING. AND IMPROVING ON THOSE PARTNERSHIPS DEVELOP THINGS SOME REGIONAL COORDINATION- AND ENHANCING THAT AND- AND ALSO AGAIN A THEME OF DEVELOPING UNIFIED DATA SYSTEMS AND ANALYTICAL DASHBOARDS FOR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CONTINUE IN PUBLIC HEALTH A RESOURCES ACROSS THE STATE- THE THIRD QUESTION WAS TO. FOCUS ON TESTING CAPACITY- INCLUDING THE PROBLEMS OF DIFFERENT TESTING METHODOLOGIES AND THEIR DISTRIBUTION AND DEPLOYMENT THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO ARE- TESTING CAPACITY WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A CAPACITY THAT AND ONE POINT IS EXCEEDED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PCR TEST TODAY. AT THE PEAK OF OUR SEARCH THERE ARE SEVERAL DAYS WHERE VOLUME WAS OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY AND OUR VOLUNTEER BRANCH I'VE STILL HAS. MORE CAPACITY THAN ACTUALLY HAS BEEN UTILIZED YET SO- WE HAVE AGAIN OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PIECE OUR CAPACITY TESTS TODAY- THAT'S STILL THE GOLD STANDARD FOR DIAGNOSTIC TESTING AND IT'S AVAILABLE THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA- THE PCR TESTING. THERE'S- LOCAL CAPACITY THAT OFTEN SERVE AND THEN WE HAVE- LIKE TO BRANCH ON CONTRACTS FOR FIXED SITES AND THERE'S MOBILE BUSES FOR HIGH VOLUME AND MINI VANS FOR LOWER VOLUME LEVEL TESTING SITES WE HAVE TRAVELING TEAMS. CAN DO COLLECTION OF COMMUNITIES- THERE ARE HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE UP TO SERVICE SITES- AND JUST LIKE WE HAVE A CONTRACT WITH AN ORGANIZATION CALLED COLOR. I'M IN COMBINATION WITH OUR LAB AS WELL THIS ALLOWING FOR TEST TO BE DROP SHIPPED TO COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS RECEIVE TRAINING. AND THEN THEY CAN DO THEIR OWN SPECIMEN COLLECTION AND THEN SHIP IT TO THE LAB AND. THERE'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY SITES FOR THAT. AND THEN OF COURSE. INTO IS- INCREASE IN YOU- INDIFFERENCE. WE ABOUT TWELVE- ANTIGEN TEST FROM ABBOTT BY NEXT TONS. THE CAME FROM THE FEDERAL. ALONG WITH THE DIRECT ON A CASE OF SOME OF THESE TESTS TO THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WE'VE ALLOCATED OVER SIX MILLION OF THESE TESTS LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS- FIRST WE GAVE SERVE A MINIMUM AMOUNT EACH COUNTY AND THEN USE THEIR SHARE OF THE TOTAL CALIFORNIA POPULATION PLUS OTHER. ADDITIONAL ALLOCATIONS FOR COUNTIES WITH HIGHER CASE RATES TO DISTRIBUTE THOSE TESTING RESOURCES- WE ALSO PROVIDED ADDITIONAL ALLOCATIONS TO RURAL AND CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES AND- AND THEN ON TO. AFTER THAT DISTRIBUTION CAN BE REQUESTED VIA OUR MEDICAL HEALTH OPERATIONAL. AREA COORDINATION- PROCESS. OF THE DOZEN WHICH IS A WORKED WITH FIVE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND ALL OF OUR STATE HOSPITALS AND THEN WE ARE IN A PILOT MODE OF TESTING- ENGINE TESTING IN THE SCHOOL SETTING AND THAT'S BEEN A VERY SUCCESSFUL PROGRAM THAT WE ARE WORKING HARD TO MAKE SURE THEY MAINTAIN QUALITY AND- ACTOR SINGER PROTOCOLS FOR THAT- WE ALSO JUST READ THESE TESTS TO CDCR FOR USAGE AND CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE UC AND CAL STATE- UNIVERSITY SYSTEMS IS. TO DISTRIBUTE THESE FURTHER. WE'RE ALSO EXPLORING LEARNING MORE ABOUT HOME COLLECTION IN HOME TEST KITS WHICH ARE PREDOMINATELY ANTIGEN BASED- THERE'S ALSO A HOME ELECT EITHER WHAT'S CALLED A LAMP TESTS. AND TESTS THAT ARE STARTING TO BE ABLE TO BE PURCHASED OVER THE COUNTER WHICH WE ARE. ACTIVELY WORKING ON SORT OF WHAT THE REPORTING MECHANISMS FOR THOSE TEST RESULTS WILL BE. CENEX I'M GONNA MOVE ONTO OF THE FOURTH QUESTION WHICH WAS PROVIDING AN OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM FOR VACCINE DISTRIBUTION INCLUDING THE ROLE OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THE FEDERAL CVS AND WALGREENS PARTNERSHIPS IN THE NEW THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR. US ALL START WAS SORT OF- THE MAIN FOCUS ON OUR ROLL UP UNTIL NOW FOR CITY PAGES THEN- AS YOU HOPEFULLY NO WE HAVE- THREE ROBUST STAKEHOLDER OF. COMMITTEES THAT HAVE BEEN REALLY CRUCIAL IN INFORMING OUR RESPONSES THE STATE. WE HAVE A WESTERN STATE SCIENTIFIC AND SAFETY WORKER COMMITTEE THAT HELPS US ASSESS ONCE THE FDA. AND THE CDC- AUTHORIZE A VACCINE FOR USE TO- SORT OF CODIFY THAT MEASURE US AS WELL THAT NO STEPS ARE SKIPPED AND EVALUATING THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THESE VACCINES. WE HAVE A DRAFTING GUIDELINES WORK GROUP THAT IS A MULTI DISCIPLINARY GROUP THAT REALLY LOOKS AT THE FEDERAL GUIDELINES AROUND ALLOCATION OF PRIVATIZATION. PRESIDENT LOOK AT OUR- POPULATION DATA FOR CALIFORNIA AND HAS REALLY HELPED US SHAPE OUR PARTICIPATION- FOR THE DIFFERENT-YOU KNOW INITIAL TEARS AND PHASES OF VACCINE ALLOCATION. AND THEN ALL OF THIS IS- VETTED WITH THEIR COMMITTEE NEXT AN ADVISORY COMMITTEE WHICH HAS BEEN A REALLY IMPORTANT. PARTNERSHIP IN BOTH GETTING FEEDBACK ON ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS AS WELL AS GETTING OUR MESSAGE OUT TO DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS AND COMMUNITIES- SO WE SETTLE THESE POLICIES WITH THOSE- IN MIND. WE ARE A LIAISON AND POINT OF CONTACT IN THE- CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL PREVENTION- WE WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTISE- PRIOR. TO NOW ARE AND- WE'VE BEEN IN ROLLING PROVIDERS THAT ARE THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATORS. AND ALLOCATING AGAIN THIS IS A VACCINE BASED ON A PRIORITY. POPULATIONS- WE'VE PLAYED ORDERS THE FEDERAL. AND A- WITH ANY **** MY OUR TEMPERATURE EXCURSION ISSUES- WE'VE- BEEN ACTIVELY- THAT YOU KNOW CLEANING AND THEN- INCREASING OUR STATE WOULD MEDIA CAMPAIGN. AND EDUCATION. AND THEN DATA SYSTEMS OF COURSE AGAIN HAVE BEEN A REALLY CRUCIAL SO WE HAVE- OUR STATEWIDE CALIFORNIA MUSICIAN REGISTRY AND THEN THERE ARE TWO REGIONAL REGISTRIES AND- WORKING TO INTEGRATE THOSE AND IMPROVE THE CAPACITY OF THOSE. AND THAT HAS EVOLVED INTO- CAL ACTS WHICH IS OUR START AND END SYSTEM. AND I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN HEARING MORE AND MORE ABOUT MY TURN WHICH IS A PUBLIC SCHEDULING AS ONE COMPONENT AND CLINIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEM AS WELL. AND THEN WE INTERACT WITH THE FEDERAL DATA SYSTEMS SUCH AS VACCINE FINDER AND THE BACK END OF THAT IS CALLED TIBERIUS AND THAT'S HOW WE GET A LOT OF OUR- REPORTS THAT ARE WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND THAT'S- ONE OF THE ELEMENTS IT PROVIDES INPUT INTO TRACKING VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. AND NOW WE'RE ASSISTING IN TRANSITION TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- AND CONTINUE TO ASSIST WITH CLINICAL AND SAFETY GUIDANCE. AS FAR AS WORKING WITH A LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS- THEY- WILL BE HIGHLIGHTED LATER AS THEY- TESTIFY ON YOU KNOW ON WHAT THEIR ACTIVITIES ARE BUT THEY- YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN RECEIVING THESE ALLOCATION AND- AND RE JUST READING TO OTHER SMALLER PROVIDERS- INCLUDING SOME FQHCS AND OTHER AT RISK POPULATIONS- MANY OR MOST OF THEM ALSO TO PROVIDE THEIR OWN ASPECTS NATION CLINICS AND THEY HAVE LOCAL NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS- AND- AND THEN ONCE THEY DO THOSE ALLOCATIONS THE SHIPMENTS GO DIRECTLY TO THOSE PROVIDERS. THE MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES- TODAY HAVE BEEN KAISER SUTTER ADVENTIST UC HEALTH SYSTEMS PROVIDENCE- AND MHC. AND THESE ARE DIRECT ON OCCASIONS WHEN THE STATE THAT. ARE GIVEN THE PATIENT PERCENTAGE THEY REPRESENT AND THE STATE. AND THEN THERE'S A COUPLE STATE MULTI COUNTY ENTITIES SO THAT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS AND CDCR. AND THEN JUST BRIEFLY AS FAR AS THE PHARMACY PROGRAM SO CVS AND WALGREENS- THE FIRST PHASE OF THAT WAS FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. THAT WAS PART A- AND THEN- PART B. WAS TO AUGMENT AND ADD TO THAT TO FOR ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. SO PART A BEGAN AT THE END OF THE SUMMER AND THE TWO ON THE EIGHTH. B. B. ON GENERAL. AND PARDEE ISN'T JUST. TO UP THE END OF THE- AND B. TO RUN UP AND OF MARCH. AND EACH FACILITY GETS THREE CLINICS- FOR FACILITY CHIANG MAI SURE THOSE TWO DOZEN PURPOSE. GET IN WITHIN THOSE CLINICS. AND THEN STARTING THIS WEEK THE CDC IS STARTING A NEW FEDERAL. PART WITH- SUB FEDERAL. SO IT'LL BE ADDITION TO OUR STATE ALLOCATION- THE APPLICATION IS ONLY A MILLION DOSES FOR THE WHOLE COUNTRY. PER WEEK NATIONALLY SO IT'S NOT A HUGE AMOUNT FOR CALIFORNIA- BUT IT IS YOU KNOW AGAIN ADDITIONAL JUST IS COMING TO THE STATES AND AS ACTING SUPPLY INCREASES. ADDITIONAL LOCATION THEN PARTNERS WITH FEDERAL PHARMACY PROGRAM CONTRACTS WILL RECEIVE VACCINE- THE ULTIMATE GOAL FOR THAT IS IF. NETWORK OF THOUSAND LOCATE. AS THE CDC RECOMMENDED THAT WE WORK INITIALLY WITH TO- CALIFORNIA PARTNERS THAT THEY HAD IDENTIFIED CVS AND RITE AID TO THEIR FOOT PRINT ACROSS THE STATE AND THE LEAST AMOUNT OF OVERLAP OF LOCATIONS- WITH THE OTHER. PHARMACIES SO THIS. ROLLOUT IS- STARTING TO DAY. AND ROLLING OUT TWO HUNDRED IT'S- IN THE STATE AND PLANS ARE GONNA BECOME AVAILABLE FOR BOOKING AS EARLY AS- OR HAVE BEEN BECOME AVAILABLE FOR BOOKING AS EARLY AS THE NINTH- CVS IS SAID THAT THE- THEY'D- ACTUALLY SELECTED WHICH STORES BUT THEY SAID THAT THEY DISLIKE THEM ON. BASED ON POPULATION SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER THE POPULATION DENSITY- AN ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND SOCIAL MOBILITY INDEX WHICH IS ANALOGOUS TO A HEALTHY PLACES INDEX AND STORE FOOTPRINTS. OF QUARTILE OF OUR HEALTHY PLACES INDEX AND THEY'RE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE OVER EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND FIRST US'S. PER WEEK AND THAT'LL BE ABOUT A HUNDRED- DOSES PER DAY PER STORE SEVEN DAYS A WEEK SO THAT'S A NICE AUGMENTATION- THAT JUST STARTED AND THEN RITE AID IS ROLLING OUT VACCINES TO THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR STORES STARTING TODAY AS WELL. THEIR INITIAL STORES WERE- LOW SELECTED BASED ON THEIR POPULATION WITHIN FIFTEEN MILES OF THE STORE. SIMILARLY SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER THEIR DENSITY. FOR SOME PERSONS OF COLOR- THEY ALSO LOOKED AT LIMITED ENGLISH- IN THE REGION NO VEHICLE AND AVERAGE SOCIAL MOBILITY INDEX A 28% OF THOSE STORES THAT THEY IDENTIFIED ON THE. BOTTOM EACH PACK QUARTILE. THERE EXPECT TO RECEIVE OVER THIRTY SO THOUSAND FIRST JUST PER WEEK WHICH IS ABOUT. TAXES A DAY STORE FIVE DAYS A WEEK- AND THEY WILL ALSO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF LOCATION THOSE VACCINES LIKE INCREASES. AND THEN JUST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED AS A FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP FOR WITH FQHCS OVERSIGHT AND THE CDC ARE LAUNCHING A PROGRAM. TO DIRECTLY ALLOCATE A LIMITED SUPPLY OF COVER NINETEEN VACCINE TO. PERSONAL HEALTH CENTER STARTING NEXT WEEK. SO THE INITIAL PHASE WILL INCREASE ACCESS TO VACCINES OVER TWO HUNDRED FIFTY CENTERS NATIONALLY. IT WILL BE ANOTHER INCREMENTAL EFFORT AS MORE VACCINE BECOMES AVAILABLE SO THE FIVE FQHCS ARE SELECTED TO INITIATE THE FEDERAL PROGRAM WHERE THE UNITED HEALTH CENTERS IN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. ULTIMATE HEALTH SERVICES CORPS IN COMMERCE CALIFORNIA. CLINIC A DISSOLUTE- IN SALINAS. OF THE STAFF COMMUNITY CLINIC IN THESE TO CALIFORNIA. AND J. WCHS INTO AND LA. IS A NATIONAL HEALTH CENTER IS CHOSEN FOR THIS PROGRAM INCLUDE THOSE THAT SERVE A LARGE VOLUME OF ONE OF THE FOLLOWING DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED POPULATION SO- INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS PUBLIC HOUSING RESIDENTS MIGRANT. OR SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. OR PATIENTS WITH LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENCY. THE ALLEGATION AS A SET FROM A- WEEKLY ON. SO AGAIN THIS IS AN HONOR. OF OUR CALVET LIKE- AND THEN- JUST PRE AS FAR HE TRANSIT TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR- THIS IS OVERSEEN BY GOT OFFICE- THE THIRD PARTY AND WILL PROVIDE PRIORITIZE SAFETY EQUITY AND THE FASTEST POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATION OF VACCINES- DEVELOPING AND MANAGING THE STATE VACCINE NETWORK CONTRACTS INCLUDING START UP COSTS AND MONTHLY INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTING AND COMMUNICATION PLAN WITH ALL THAT STATEWIDE NETWORK PROVIDERS AND OVERSEEING AND MANAGING THE STATE ACSI NETWORK. OF THE NEW T. PAY WILL SUPPORT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION STEP BY THE STATE- SO WE'RE WORKING CLOSELY TO DEVELOP THIS ALLOCATION FORMULAS AND THEN INCLUDING CONSIDERATION SUCH AS HOT SPOTS IN OUR EQUITY MEASURES- AND THEN THE TVA THE THIRD TRIMESTER WE FEEDING CREDITED AS REQUIRED TO MY TURN- AND ALSO THE STATEWIDE DASHBOARDS AND SO THAT'S BEING ROLLED OUT IN WAVES- THERE'S THREE WAYS THAT HAVE JUST BEEN IDENTIFIED WE'RE NOTIFYING THAT- COUNTY IS THIS. THE WEEK ON- OF HOW THOSE AWAYARE. ARE DESIGNATED. MOVING ON TO- THE QUESTION WAS TO HAVE DATA ON AFFECT OF IDENTIFICATION AND CONTACT TRACING- ARE CHEN OF NINETY AND WELL HAVE WE LEARNED CUT RAISING TO PANAMA THAT MAN MORE BECAUSE IN EFFORTS AND FUTURE- I THINK ALSO JUST WAS YOU KNOW- WE AND LOOK HEALTH OF OUR DO QUE AND HUNTER IN THE STATE FOR MANY OTHER DOES. AGAIN THE MAGNITUDE AND SCOPE OF THIS PANDEMIC HAS HAS MADE IT EXTREMELY CHALLENGING YOU KNOW IN THE MIDST OF SEARCHES- AS FAR AS OUR DATA YOU KNOW AGAIN THIS IS A CRUCIAL PUBLIC HEALTH TOOL FOR CONTAINING THE SPREAD OF. THE NINETEEN AND OTHER DISEASES- AND IT'S MOST EFFECTIVE WHEN CASE COUNTS ARE LOW ALLOWING FOR CASES AND EXPOSE CONTACTS BE REACH MORE RAPIDLY THE TESTING TURNAROUND TIME IS ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT AS FAR AS A LESSON LEARNED WITH THAT- SO IT IS DIFFICULT AGAIN WHEN THERE ARE HUGE SURGES- TO MAINTAIN THAT AND REALLY SHIFT SORT OF FROM THE SUPPRESSION WHICH CASE AND CONTACT INVESTIGATION THOSE TO THE MEDICATION WHICH IS WHY. FOR EXAMPLE WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT REGIONAL STATE HOME ORDERS OR OTHER MUCH LARGER INTERVENTIONS- SO WE DO HAVE CDC PERFORMANCE METRICS TO THAT MEASURE CONTACT RACING PERFORMANCE STATEWIDE AND THEN IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT THE SPECIFIC IMPACT OF STATEWIDE CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS BUT THERE'S A LOT OF VERY ABILITY OF LOCAL PROTOCOLS AND DATA SYSTEMS- ARE CAL CONNECTS TO SO MUCH- HAS EVOLVED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE LAST NINE MONTHS HAS CIGNA VARIATIONS AND EVEN HOW EACH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS UTILIZING THE DATA FIELDS. BUT WHAT'S NICE ABOUT IT IS WE HAVE A FIFTY FOUR HELP JURISDICTIONS ARE NOW USING IT AND- FORGET THE PROPORTION OF CASES THAT ARE IN IT NOW BUT IT REALLY IS- A GREAT I'VE BEEN TATIAN THAT'S HAPPENED TO THIS PENDING THAT REALLY HELPS US HAVE INCREASING STATE DATA ON ON THAT PIECE. OF IT- I THINK THE MOST THING MY BE TO. PROVIDE IN A- OF THE IMPACT OF CONTACT. SO SANTA CLARA- WAS ONE OF THE- KNOWS YOU KNOW WHETHER EARLY DOCTORS OF THE SITE. COUNTY THAT ADOPTED CONNECT. AND THEY LOOKED A DIFFERENCE OF. K. WHO ARE NOW. TO THE LOCAL HEALTH- AS CONTACT IN CASE WHO ARE NOT. AND WHEN NEW CASE HAD ARE BEEN RECENTLY. REACH A CONTACT RESOURCE TO NOTIFY THEM THAT THEY WERE A CONTACT. THOSE CASES WHERE ARE YOU STAYING HOME BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN GIVEN QUARANTINE INSTRUCTIONS. AND THEN NOT EXPOSE ANY NEW CONTACTS SO THEY DID BECOME DEAD ENDS FOR TRANSMISSION. AND THE PROPORTION OF THAT WAS NEARLY DOUBLE- COMPARED TO CASES WOULD NOT BEEN IN CONTACT AND HAD NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED. THANK CONTACT TRACING. OF FEWER CASES WERE PREVIOUSLY KNOWN AS CONTACTS WERE NOT IN ISOLATION. AND THAT- SO THAT DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD DISTANCE BRAD'S WAS CONDUCT RACING'S ALSO FOUND AN OVERALL SLIGHTLY HIGHER SUCCESS RATE REACHING THE CASE. THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN KNOWN AND REACHED AS A CONTACT. OF AND THAT OF COURSE NOW IS WHEN I. BY CALIFORNIA NOTIFIED WE HAVE OVER NINE MILLION USERS TO THAT THAT HAVE THE- ANONYMOUS IDENTITY. IF THEY'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH FOREIGN ROLLED. THE IS JUST AN EXAMPLE FROM COUNTY TO SKI YOU A OF- A MORE- GRANULAR. AT OF THE IN. I AS FAR AS THE KEY LESS LEARNED- I ALREADY MET THE FASTER ONTO RESULTS CRUCIAL WE NEED TO. LOOK UP AND ABOUT A CASE QUICKLY AND TO REACH AND CONTACT. TO FINE BOTH CASES INCOME. ARE THEIR PAIN THAT THE TIME INFECTION PERIOD IN KEEPING PERIOD- I. NEEDS TO BE SCALED RAPIDLY- SO AGAIN WE WERE ALREADY- I THINK AS PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM YOU KNOW. PROBABLY WERE UNDER RESOURCE TO DO THE CASE AND CUTTING MEDICATIONS WE NEED TO DO FOR THE OTHER. OVER AT REPORTABLE DISEASES AND- AND THEN HAVE THIS PANDEMIC ON TOP OF THIS I THINK WE- TRYING TO MOBILIZE YOU KNOW THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE AND- DID AN AMAZING JOB TRAINING AS WELL WITH THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE UC'S OF RITUAL TRAINING ACADEMY. BUT I THINK AS FAR AS A LESSON LEARNED WE NEED TO REALLY MAINTAIN A REALLY ROBUST PUBLIC HEALTH STAFFING INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT- IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE SET UP. IN SUCH A AN URGENT WAY- WE HAD A VERY VERY SMALL EXISTING WORKFORCE EXPERIENCE INVESTIGATORS THE NEED TO- QUICKLY TRAIN AND LEAD OTHERS TO DO THAT. I THINK THE OTHER LESSON LEARNED IS THAT YOU KNOW- IN CALIFORNIA THE WILLINGNESS OF INFECTED INDIVIDUALS TO SPEAK TO CASE AND CONTACT INVESTIGATORS AND SHARE INFORMATION- IS REALLY TERRIBLE THE WILLINGNESS OF THE GENERAL PUBLIC TO ANSWER CALLS AND TEXTS FROM THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND ENGAGE WITH CONTACT RACING IS- IS VERY ABLE SO- THIS REQUIRES INVESTMENT AND PUBLIC EDUCATION A MESSAGING IN MANY LANGUAGES TO ENCOURAGE ENGAGEMENT LOCALIZE COMMUNICATION EFFORTS AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FOR TRUSTED STAKEHOLDERS- AND AGAIN A WORK FORCE THE NEEDS LANGUAGE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIANS AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT WORK FORCE- WITH CLIENT CENTERED PRACTICES OF THOSE ARE. SOME HUGE LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE NEED TO MAINTAIN TO KEEP US PREPARED FOR ALL INFECTIOUS DISEASES. OF THE ABILITY TO OFFER RESOURCES FOR INFECTED INDIVIDUALS TO ISOLATE QUARANTINE. SO THINGS LIKE WAGE REPLACEMENT SO THEY CAN PROPERLY ISOLATE OR QUARANTINE HOUSING FOOD DELIVERY DURING SITUATIONS TO REALLY MAKE SURE WE CAN INTERRUPT TRANSMISSION- OTHER POLICIES THAT COULD SUPPORT THAT OUR ENFORCEMENT OR INCENTIVES TO ENSURE BUSINESSES SUPPORT QUARANTINE AND ISOLATION REQUIREMENTS OF THEIR STAFF. OF AND THEN OF COURSE AGAIN THE ABILITY TO ANALYZE AND OBTAIN A CASE DATA AND CONTACT DATA- TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A REALLY- INFORMED. ANALYSIS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING STATEWIDE- AND THAT REALLY- ROBUST DATA SYSTEMS AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN ALSO- HELP US WITH STRONG INTERJECTION COMMUNICATION IN COORDINATION TO IMPROVE SPEED AND EFFICACY OF TRANSFERRING CASES AND CONTACTS BETWEEN. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND pSHARING DATA AND TACKLING OUTBREAKS TOGETHER. SO THE LAST QUESTION I AM GOING TO BE ADDRESSING IS- HOW IS THE CURRENT CODE NINETEEN RESPONSE HIGHLIGHTED GAPS IN READINESS THAT MIGHT HELP THE STATE AND DPH TO PREPARE FOR THE NEXT PANDEMIC. WHAT WOULD CAUSE CHEN ADEQUATELY RESOURCE PREPAREDNESS EFFORTS SO AGAIN JUST TO KIND OF YOU KNOW THAT IS SUMMER IS A LOT OF WHAT I HAD ALREADY SAID THAT I THINK YOU KNOW CORE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IS REALLY. A ONE OF THE HUGE GAPS AND I THINK THE TWO MAIN AREAS ARE STAFFING SO HAVING YOU KNOW ROBUST EPIDEMIOLOGY- EXPERIENCE CASE AND CONTACTED THE SKATERS OUTBREAK INVESTIGATORS- HAVING THE CAPACITY TO DO- MORE SOPHISTICATED DATA ANALYSIS AND MODELING HAVE BEEN REALLY. HELPFUL WE GOT DEVELOP SOME GREAT PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ACADEMIC PARTNERS WHICH WILL BE HEARING ABOUT LATER IN ANOTHER BUDGET REQUEST- AND ALSO- HAVING THE ABILITY TO HAVE OUR WORK FIRST EVALUATE THESE INTERVENTIONS SO. DOING THAT BOTH WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT AND THEN AGAIN REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE- PARTNERSHIPS WE'RE DEVELOPING WITH OUR ACADEMIC PARTNERS TO FORMALIZE ALL THOSE PARTNERSHIPS- AND THEN REALLY OF COURSE THE INVOLVING- TOPIC IS GENOMICS WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING AND- INCREASING THEIR LEAD ANOTHER LABORATORY TESTING BUT OUR ABILITY TO DO WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCING WE ACTUALLY HAVE. ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST SYSTEMS IN THE NATION- BUT AGAIN IT'S- IT'S NOWHERE NEAR OTHER COUNTRIES FOR EXAMPLE LIKE THE UNITED KINGDOM SO WE'RE RAPIDLY SCALING THAT UP AS WELL. AGAIN WITH PARTNERS SO- I THINK THE OTHER GAP AGAIN IS INVESTMENT IN OUR DATA AND IT INFRASTRUCTURE- BOTH THE ACTUAL SYSTEM THEMSELVES AND I. T. STAFFING TO SUPPORT THAT WE CAN'T. COLLECT GOOD DATA THAT WE DON'T HAVE GOOD IT SYSTEMS AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND GOOD- ROBUST STAFFING TO SUPPORT THAT AS WELL. WHEN WE HAVE REVIEWED OUR- AFTER ACTION APART FROM THE TWO THOUSAND NINE PANDEMIC H. ONE ON ONE IT ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE NEED FOR US TO MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE WE'VE DEVELOPED FOR COVERED GOING FORWARD. BUT UNFORTUNATE THAT AND PANDEMIC ALSO HAPPENED IN- A DIFFICULT BUDGET TIME AND A LOT OF THOSE RESOURCES INFRASTRUCTURE- DID DISAPPEAR AND I THINK THE THEME. THAT WE'VE SEEN IN PUBLIC HEALTH IS- HOW THESE VARIOUS SMALL. INFECTION EMERGED LIKE A- SEEK THE PRIOR PAN AND GETTING SOME SHORT TERM FUNDING BUT THEN THE SHORT TERM FUNDING GOES AWAY AND WHAT WE REALLY NEED AS LONG TERM SUSTAINMENT OF THE ROBUST PUBLIC HEALTH. SO THAT IS A GOOD SEGUE I'LL TURN IT OVER TO JACK'S WELL TO TALK MORE ABOUT OUR BUDGET AND- FUNDING. S. GOOD MORNING CENTERS JESSELTON FINANCE ARE. IN THE ATTIC QUESTION SEVEN I REQUESTED A AB REVIEW COUNTING OF ALLOCATIONS OR STATE FEDERAL FUNDING PRETTY BIJUR BRITANNIC RELATED THAT EXPENDITURES YESTERDAY EVENING WE SENT A FULL CHART. OF ALL THOSE CATEGORIES OVER TO US AND STAFF BY I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S- MATED TO THE SENATE AT THIS POINT- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THIRTY THREE ROWS OF DATA EACH WITH ITS OWN SUBSET- DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS THE BEST VALUE TO RUN TO THAT CHART- BUT IT HAS BEEN PROVIDED AND- MORE THAN HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. ABOUT THAT NOW OR OR AROUND. IF YOU HAVE QUESTIONS YOU REVIEW THAT JORDAN YOU CAN SEND THEM TO US THROUGH YOUR STAFF AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM BUT- WE WERE ABLE TO SECURE THAT DATA. FOR YOU- AHEAD OF THIS YEAR. THANK YOU- AT THAT APPRECIATE THAT YOU SENT TO DATE OVERESTIMATE I'M NOT A CHANCE TO LOOK AT MYSELF- I KNOW OUR STAFF WORKS VERY HARD ON THESE THINGS. MAYBE YOU CAN. THIS IS AN OVERVIEW TO THAT- BECAUSE MY WHEN MY COURT QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF- AND I APPRECIATE THAT- GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING AN ADDITIONAL ESSENTIALLY A HUNDRED AND FIFTY. SOME MILLION STATE GENERAL FUNDS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PART PUBLIC HEALTH. HOW HOW MUCH OF THAT IS- I GUESS- DIRECTLY PANDEMIC RELATED AND THEREFORE IT'S OKAY THIS WAS LIKE YOU YEAH I KNOW THAT- EVEN THOUGH TECHNICALLY ONLY PASS A BUDGET FOR A YEAR WE DO MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS. AND SO HOW MUCH OF THAT INCREASE IS GOING TO THE KIND OF INFRASTRUCTURE- THANK ITEMS THAT- DOCTOR POND JUST- TALKED ABOUT. SO THEREFORE IS GONNA BE MULTI YAR. VERSES I GUESS A YEAR BY YEAR WHERE IT'S A THIS IS DIRECTLY. COVERED RESPONSE SO OBVIOUSLY COVERED RESPONSE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND THAT'S WHEN FRONT OF US BUT- MOST OF THINKING IN TERMS OF THE MORE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO MAKE IN THE DEPARTMENT. FOR EXAMPLE AROUND IT AND SO FORTH AND I DO I DO RECALL THAT- SO A COUPLE YEARS AGO- WE ARE STARTING TO BARK IN THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT IT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR. A CD P. H. AND THEN- COVERT HITS- SO- SO WE WERE ALREADY THINKING ABOUT THAT AHEAD OF TIME BUT I JUST WANNA KNOW THAT. SO OF THAT INCREASE CAN YOU JUST SPEAK TO THAT AND AS BROAD TERMS. ABSOLUTELY SIR AND- THINKING ABOUT IT AND THAT TERM YOU KNOW OF COURSE ARE A LARGE MARGIN FUSIONS OF CASH ON THE ON A ONE TIME BASIS TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ECONOMIC RESPONSE A LOT OF THAT WILL BUILD SOME OF THAT I IT INFRASTRUCTURE YOU'VE DISCUSSED- I MEAN WHILE A LOT OF WHAT OUR EFFORTS ARE FOCUSED ON NOW- OKAY NINETEEN OF NINETEEN RELIEF TRACKING- THE SORT OF. SYSTEMS AND SYSTEM UPGRADES THAT WERE MAKING ON THE I. T. SIDE TO VARIOUS FAXING DATABASES STORE CONTACT GRAYSON SYSTEM- YOU KNOW THOSE ARE GONNA GO WAY WHEN THIS IS OVER AND OF COURSE OF DEALING WITH THIS THIS PRYING CRISIS IS- IS OUR NUMBER ONE PRIORITY BUT A LARGER YOU KNOW A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE MONEY THAT'S BEING- CHANNELED INTO THE APARTMENT. AND DEMOCRATS SPONSORS WAY TO BUILD LONG TERM CAPACITY YOU KNOW SPECIFICALLY IN ADDITION TO THOSE I. T. INVESTMENTS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND YOU KNOW EXPANSION OF LABORATORY CAPACITY- ADDITIONAL STAFF IS BEING BROUGHT ON I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN A LONG TERM CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO HOW TO INVEST IN PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND- MOVING FOR WITH THE LEGISLATURE- BUT AS IT STANDS NOW- IT'S DIFFICULT TO SPECIFICALLY DELINEATE WHICH INVESTMENTS ARE GOING TO BE. GOVERNMENT RESPONSE AND WENT AND WENT OVER RESPONSES CONCLUDED THERE'S NOT A LOT OF LONG RANGE IMPACT ON THE OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH READINESS IN THE IMPACTING DEVELOPERS SYSTEM BUT THERE IS THERE BEEN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS- IN. REAL REAL LAB. YOUR QUICK MENTOR OKAY BLACK BASS. I STRUCTURE THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO THE LAW RUN- AND WE'RE ALSO SORT OF STACKING UP. A BROADER HEALTH. THAT ONCE WE SORT OF ADDRESS THIS IS. OKAY NINETEEN WILL PASS WE CAN WE CAN REALIGN ANCESTRY OUT PRIORITIES. OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE ANY APPRECIATE INTO EXAMPLE LIKE I. T. OBVIOUSLY OUT. AS WELL AS WHERE YOU CAN PUT THEM U FRONT CAPITAL AND THEN. BUT YOU LSO HAVE MAINTENANCE STAFFING IS AN ONGOING EXPENSE SO YOU KNOW THAT'S THE OTHER PART INFRASTRUCTURE SO ARE WE TALKING ABOUT. SOME PERMANENT INCREASES IN STAFF- KNOWING THAT WE WERE EVEN PRE COVETED. SHORTHANDED AND- ALLOW THE STAFF IN C. P. H. R. FOR SPECIFIC GRANT PROJECTS OTHER TYPES OF THINGS WE GET FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS YOU MAY KNOW IN THE INTRODUCTION ONLY ACTUALLY COME FROM THE STATE ADDRESSES. FROM FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH IS VERY. PHYSICALLY YOU KNOW. TO VERY THING IT'S NOT THAT IT'S JUST LIKE THE CA.GOV GAVE US A PART OF MY INSTEAD USE IT AS- THAT THINK IS A- APPROPRIATE SO. WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A CERTAIN RIGIDITY TO THE FEDERAL FUNDS. AND AND THINGS LIKE. WHAT IS CONTACT TRACING CAPACITY I YOU KNOW IT RESPONSE AND FAXES THESE THOSE ARE REALLY CORE PUBLIC HEALTH FUNCTIONS. OFTENTIMES ARE FUND DO NOT END UP BEING FUNDED BY THE STATE OR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND- SO- I DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT. AS WE'RE- AND I KNOW IT'S SO HARD TO TEASE SOME OF THAT OUT BUT AS WE'RE LOOKING AT SORT OF. A MULTI YEAR PROJECTIONS THAT FINANCES DOING AND SO FOR THAT WE'RE HAVING THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THE STRUCTURE OF THE BUDGET. I WOULD BE INTERESTED IN KNOWING AND BILL WE CAN. CERTAINLY DO THIS AFTER THE HEARING WILL TO GO ALL THE DETAILS HERE AND HEARING RIGHT NOW BUT- IS THAT WHAT ARE WE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF. MORE LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS AND PUBLIC HEALTH CAPACITY- OVER YEARS VERSUS YOU KNOW OKAY WELL WE HAD A YOU KNOW WE HAVE FEDERAL MONEY WE HAVE IT CENTER- AND IN TERMS OF THE- CODE RESPONSE AND YES SOME INVESTMENTS WE'RE GOING FOR GOLD RESPONSE WILL HAVE- HELP US. YOUNG TECH. WILL HELP US THE MOST BUT- AND THEN ALSO ANYTHING ABOUT LABORATORIES AND I JUST POINT OUT THAT I THINK WE'VE LOST A TWELVE LET COUNTY LABORATORIES SO. YOU KNOW WE- WILL BE LOOKING SYSTEMATICALLY AT A LABORATORY CAPACITY SO I KNOW THAT CERTAINLY WE HAVE OUR STATE LAB AND APPRECIATE WE'RE INVESTING IN THAT. SO WHAT KIND OF THE NEW CAPACITIES REBUILDING IN THERE BUT ALSO HOW WE MAKING UP FOR THE LOSS OF LOCAL LABS. AS WELL AND ARE WE TAKING A MORSE- SIR STATEWIDE EARLY STRATEGIC APPROACH AND PARTNERING WITH OUR LOCAL COUNTIES TO BE SURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT TOTAL LAB CAPACITY AND ON THE PUBLIC HEALTH SIDE IN OUR STATE BECAUSE WE KNOW A LOT OF CAPACITY IS NOT ACTUALLY. DIRECTLY FUNDED BY THE STATE BUT HAS BY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. ARE COUNTY GOVERNMENT I SHOULD SAY. YES YOU KNOW WHY IN THE LAST BUDGET ACT WE PROVIDED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR THE STATE LABORATORY STAFF EQUIPMENT. THAT'S ONGOING. YES- WE HAVE A LOT OF. AT LEAST IN THE IN THE NEAR TERM WE HAVE A HUGE NEED THAT'S LARGELY BEING FUNDED BY ONE TIME EXPANDING ONE TIME FUNDING SOURCES. AND YOU KNOW AS WE ADVANCE THROUGH THIS PROCESS AND FOR THE- BUDGET I THINK WE'LL BE HAVING A- MORE FOR CONVERSATION ABOUT. THE- LONGER TERM INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH- AT THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE WERE FOCUSED ON PROVIDING THE FULLEST ACCOUNTING OF BUDGET YEAR EXPENDITURES IN THIS. INDUSTRY BROWN IS A REALISTIC OF THE RESPONSE. THE DISCUSSION AS TO WHETHER THE LONG TERM FUTURE OF STATE INVESTMENT AND PUBLIC HEALTH IT WOULD BE. IS GOING TO BE A COMMON CONVERSATION AND SPECIFICALLY ABOUT LOCAL LABORATORIES WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE. TO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL- EPIDEMIOLOGICAL LABORATORY CAPACITY GRANTS FROM THE CDC- MUCH OF WHICH IS GONE TOO- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORIES TO EXPAND OUR CAPACITY ABILITY- AND NOT ONLY THAT- WITH WITH THE- INCREASED. DEMAND FOR TESTING WE'VE BEEN TO STAND UP AND LENDS A BRANCH LABORATORY. BROWN TO INCREASE OUR TESTING THAT IS SO I THINK WE'VE WE'VE BEEN MAKING SOME PRETTY. SIGNIFICANT UP FRONT INVESTMENTS AND- WE'RE GONNA GO WITH THOSE AND BUT WHAT WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE CREATED AND WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE MOVING FORWARD. I THINK WILL BE AN ONGOING DISCUSSION FOR TO HAPPEN THAT WITH LEGISLATION OKAY WELL I DID IT LOOK FOR TOO WELL WHAT HAPPENS MAY REVISE I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT- UNDER GOVERNOR NEWSOM. AT LEAST- LAST YEAR WE HAD FOR THE FIRST TIME ACTUALLY PROVIDE SOME HELP FOR. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS THANKS TO THE GOVERNOR- THIS WAS RIGHT BEFORE KOBE AND- I'M HOPING WE CAN BUILD ON THAT KIND OF INVESTMENT- ESPECIALLY WITH THE LESSONS WE'RE LEARING FROM COVERED ABOUT NEED. TO BUILD THAT CAPACITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU GRANT- THIRD DOWN BOND. WE HAVE BEEN THIS. TO FOR. A NOW- WE'VE REFLECT. LAST YEAR AT THIS TIME WE HAD ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN CASES I THINK REPORT SAYS AND NOW WE ARE. AT OVER. THREE MILLION THREE AND A HALF MILLION THAT THAT HAS UCKED HAS TRANSFORMED EVERYBODY'S LIFE IN CALIFORNIA- AND DOCTOR PAN HAS A LOT OF A- KNOWLEDGE AND WEEDS IN THIS AREA BUT I'M JUST GONNA TALK LIKE A- LIKE A REGULAR. PERSON WHO I HAVE TO INTERACT WITH EVERY SINGLE DAY IN MY DISTRICT. RIGHT IT IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON THIS JOURNEY AND I GUESS IN IN VERY- CONCRETE TERMS I'M WONDERING. AND I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS OUT THERE ARE WONDERING- WHAT KIND OF WHAT HAVE WE LEARNED. WITH THE FIRST PROCESS AND IN PLACE LIKE THE CENTRAL VALLEY THAT I REPRESENT- TESTING WAS VERY LATE TO GET ON. IT WOULD TAKE TWO WEEKS SOMETIMES AFTER SOMEBODY GOT TESTED. IN AND HEAVILY AGRICULTURAL. COMMUNITY WAITING TWO WEEKS TO FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF THE TEST WAS UNACCEPTABLE. AND THAT IS PART OF THE REASON WE SPREAD AND IN A WAY THAT WE DID BECAUSE PEOPLE COULD NOT STAY HOME AND CONTINUE TO WORK AND CONTINUE TO CARPOOL. AND WE'VE SEEN AT THE RESPONSE OF THOSE OUTBREAKS. OUR TESTING IS BETTER NOW BUT NOW I THINK WE'RE FACING THE SAME THING WITH THE VACCINATIONS AND WHILE I KNOW WE'RE DOING A LOT TO GET THEM OUT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THE AVERAGE PERSON OUT THERE KEEP SAYING WHERE DO I GET MY WHEN DO I GET MINE. AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY. AND I THINK EVERY TIME WE ROLL OUT A NEW PROGRAM OR NEW TEAR. IT CONFUSES EVERYBODY AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE DATA IS MOVING QUICKLY AND I UNDERSTAND WE'VE HAD A CHANGE IN ADMINISTRATION. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK ONE OF TH MESSAGES THAT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH IS. CLEAR CONCISE. INFORMATION AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THE PUBLIC FEELS LIKE THEY HAVE RECEIVED THAT- AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT. THAT THE HEALTH DEPARTMENT BUT LIKE THEY HAVE RECEIVED THAT AS WELL. EIGHT AM. TODAY AND OFTENTIMES OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN UNDER. UNDER FIRE UNDER ATTACK- FROM. MOVE CONSTITUENTS WHO WHO DISAGREE WITH THE SCIENCE AND THEN. HAVE ROOM TO QUESTION THE SCIENCE- SO. WHAT DO YOU MEAN WHAT DO YOU SAY TO THE AVERAGE PERSON WHO SAYS. YOU KNOW WE COULDN'T GET THE TESTING RIGHT AND I AND I'M IN THE COUNTY. I DON'T BELIEVE AS A LAB AS WE KEEP SENDING THEM OFF AND THEN. THE DATA WOULDN'T BE INTEGRATED AND SO. YOU KNOW AND EVERYONE'S VERY. WAS FOCUSED ON THE TEARS. AND THEN THE TEARS CHANGED. AND IT. HOW SO HOW WHAT IS OUR- AS- WHAT IS OUR ASSURANCE I GUESS THAT WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THROUGH TESTING. WHAT WE'VE LEARNED WITH OUR CONTRACT TRACERS AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO USE THOSE- AND NOW AGAIN WE'VE GOT. ACT BECAUSE I UNDERSTOOD WALGREENS CVS AND RITE AID WE'RE JUST GOING TO BE FOR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT NOW I'M HEARING. IT'S GOING TO BE FOR EVERYBODY. AND THEN THEN WE HAVE OUR TO WEAR BLUE SHIELD AND KAISER COMING IN. SO I JUST I THINK THEY'RE STILL REMAINS A LOT OF CONFUSION ABOUT WHO'S DOING WHAT WHO'S ON FIRST- THE COUNTIES I THINK WONDER ARE THEY STILL GOING TO IT ARE THEY STILL GOING TO BE INVOLVED. ARE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GIVING IT OUT NOW THEY'VE YOU KNOW EVERYONE'S REALLY BUILT OUT OF SYSTEM. TO BE ABLE TO. TOUCH ALL THE FOLKS WHO WHO OFTENTIMES ARCHITECTURE OR NEED TO BE- ADDRESSED. IN WILL BE ABLE TO USE THAT SYSTEM WITH THE NEW. THIRD PARTY AS WELL AS WITH THE NEW ORGANIZATIONS. THAT ARE THAT ARE DOING ALL THAT. SO YOUR QUESTION IS JUST. SORT OF HOW DO WE HOW DO WE RESPOND TO. A RESPONSE YET. YEAH I MEAN I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR I THINK- I THINK A FEW THINGS I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED LOTS OF LESSONS AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE DOING MUCH EARLIER ON NOW IS. REALLY MAKING SURE WE INTEGRATE AN ACTUAL- EQUITY BASED FORMULA- MOVING FORWARD INTO- DISTRIBUTION OF RESOURCES AND I THINK THAT'S DEFINITELY INCREASED INVOLVED OVER TIME AS FAR AS PROVIDING RESOURCES REALLY THINKING ABOUT THAT- AT DIFFERENT LEVELS RATED. BOTH THE COUNTING ON ALSO STATEWIDE LEVEL AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE- ALLOCATING RESOURCES BECAUSE- YOU KNOW AGAIN AS YOU MENTIONED CENTRAL VALLEY- YOU KNOW HUSBAND IS PARTIALLY IMPACTED AND NEEDS- DIFFERENTIAL RESOURCES JUST BASED ON WHAT'S THERE SO I THINK WE'RE NOT JUST FRESNO. RIGHT RIGHT AND I THINK COMMUNICATION ALWAYS NEEDS TO BE YOU KNOW WE ARE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND I MEANT THAT AND ACTUALLY IMPROVED THE- LEVEL OF RESOURCES- I THINK. WELL AS I THINK I JUST I AND I THINK AS A- COMMUNITY I THINK WE HEARD IS JUST AGAIN THAT THIS ISN'T IT CONTINUES TO RAPIDLY EVOLVE SO AS YOU POINTED OUT COMMUNICATION IS CRUCIAL BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO. COMMUNICATE THE THINGS CONTINUE TO CHANGE- BUT NEED TO COMMUNICATE THEM CLEARLY SO I THINK WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON IMPROVING THAT MESSAGE AND- THAT TRANSITION IS HARD AND WE HAD SO MANY CHANGES- OVER THIS- NOW OVER A YEAR OF THIS. THE PANDEMIC AND LEARNING ABOUT THIS DISEASE- SO I THINK YOU KNOW WE CONTINUE TO PROVE I THINK WE HAVE LEARNED A LOT I THINK WE HAVE IMPROVED A LOT I THINKWE ALWAYS HAVE MORE ROOM TO IMPROVE AND WE ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON THAT AS FAR AS- GETTING MORE MORE CLRITY ON. I KNOW WE ARE IN TRANSITION RIGHT NOW AS WE OF ALL THOSE THOSE- CLARITY OF ROLES AND COMMUNICATING THOSE WELL- WE ARE ALSO WORKING ON- HOW WE'RE GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT. HOPEFULLY AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO GIVE US MORE- MORE ABILITY TO PROJECT YOU KNOW BEYOND JUST TO TWO OR THREE TWO WEEKS RIGHT NOW IS ABOUT WILL TELL US TWO OR THREE WEEKS WHICH IS MORE THAN BEFORE WHICH IS ONLY ONE WEEK AT A TIME- I THINK AS WE CAN SEE MORE SUPPLY WILL BE ABLE TO MAP ON A PROJECT FOR THE PUBLIC AS WELL LIKE WHEN WE THINK WE'LL HAVE ENOUGH SUPPLY FOR. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT- DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND FOR THE GENERAL PUBLIC SO WE'RE ACTUALLY WORKING ON THAT AND I YOU KNOW IT HAS BEEN A LONG HARD YEAR FOR EVERYBODY AND WE UNDERSTAND THE FRUSTRATION AND WE CONTINUE TO IMPROVE AND GET BETTER. IT INTO CAN YOU. JUST VERY CLEAR TERMS DELINEATE BETWEEN THE- WALGREENS CVS. OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AGENCIES. THE FQHCS. THE AND THE THIRD PARTY HOW. AND INTERACTING WITH THEIR COUNTIES. THREE ONE MORE TIME ABOUT HOW MANY VACCINES OR THE POT TO THE VACCINES ARE BEING DISTRIBUTED TO EACH OF THOSE AND THEN WHAT IS THEIR ROLE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE DELIVERY OF THAT. SO SAID TO SHIP BACK TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR WILL BE REALLY DOING ALL OF THE ALLEGATIONS THAT ARE NOT SO. THE FEDERAL PHARMACY PARTNERSHIPS OR THESE AND ACTUALLY NOT THESE FEDERAL ACTUALLY DIDN'T EVEN MENTION THESE FEDERAL SITES THAT- ALL THE STUFF IN OAKLAND IN L. A. COUNTY- BUT EVERYTHING THAT IS NOT THAT WILL BE COORDINATED BY THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR ONCE THE TRANSITION IS COMPLETE SO ALL THE PROVIDERS. AND THAT OUR ROLE NOW WILL BE SWITCHING OVER TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR SO THAT IS A COMBINATION- COUNTIES VIA LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS- THEY'RE ALSO RELATIONSHIPS WITH AFTER EACH USE THAT WE ALREADY HAVE WITH THE STATE THAT COULD BE TRANSITION AND- THERE ARE LOCAL PHARMACIES AS WELL THAT COULD BE IN THOSE NETWORKS- SO THAT THEIR PRIME MINISTER IS GOING TO BE- YOU KNOW STARTING WITH THESE WAVES AND DOING IN THREE WAYS FROM THAT- LOOK UP. AND ALSO WORKING WITH HEALTH SYSTEMS AND THEN THERE ARE AS AS YOU MENTIONED ARE MULTIPLE DIFFERENT KINDS OF PROVIDERS AND AS WE GET MORE SUPPLY WE WANT TO HAVE MORE ABILITY TO GET ACCION'S MORE MORE LOCATION. RIGHT OTHER PHARMACIES- SO THAT THE CAR BALLOTS- TO COVER ANY OTHER PRIVATE. FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED. SEPARATELY ARE- THE THESE NEWER PARTNERSHIPS IN THE FQHC PARTNERSHIP ON THEN THE MOST RECENT PHASE OF A PHARMACY PARTNERSHIP FOR CDS AND WRITING- AND THEN THESE. THESE LARGE SORT OF MEGA SITES ARMOR IS BRINGING BACK SEEMS TO HAVE THOSE ARE SEPARATES- AND THEN- AS INTER IT BECAUSE- WILL BE. A SEPARATE I'LL- AND WELL AS THE PARTY. P. WITH. THE REST OF THOSE I DON'T KNOW SOMEONE WE GOT BOXES ON THE MY LAI WEEK MORE THAT. BUT OKAY OFF OF THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH- IN AND I DID AND I. YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK I COULD ACKNOWLEDGE ENOUGH THAT I KNOW IT'S A MOVING TARGET AND I KNOW IT'S YOU KNOW IT IS IT IS UNPRECEDENTED. BUT EVERYTHING LET ME IS ASK IS EVERYTHING YOU JUST EXPLAINED- DOES IF I CAN CALL ANY PUBLIC HEALTH PERSON. DIRECTOR IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THEY WOULD KNOW THAT THAT INFORMATION THAT YOU JUST REPORTED TO ME. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHEN WE THINK ABOUT PLANNING AND THINGS CHANGE. HOW DOES IT IMPACT ON THE ON THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEN HOW DO THEY- COMMUNICATE THAT OUT LOCALLY. YEAH AND AGAIN I CAN KNOWLEDGE BECAUSE THINGS HAVE BEEN SO FAST MOVING- AS HAS THE INFORMATION- WE- YOU KNOW WE DO OUR BEST TO- YOU KNOW WE ARE OFTEN ON THE PHONE WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO THE LEADERSHIP LEVEL. TWO THREE FOUR TIMES A WEEK AND THEN WE HAVE. YOU KNOW DIFFERENT DAILY OR WEEKLY CALLS THAT ARE KIND OF TOWN HALLS AROUND MAXINE IMPLEMENTATION FOR DIFFERENT LEVELS OF THE MUSICIAN CORNING'S AND THERE'S- SO WE TRY TO PUSH THAT INFORMATION AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN AND AS WE GET IT- AND AS IT'S EITHER. CONFIRMED OR APPROVED- AND SO AND BUT IT IS BECAUSE IT'S PROBABLY MOVING I CAN SPEAK AS A PRIOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT PERSON TO. IT'S HARD TO STAY ON TOP OF ALL THE INCOMING INFORMATION AS WELL- WE DEVELOP THINGS LIKE A SHAREPOINT SITE WHERE WE CAN SHARE INFORMATION- WITH LOCAL DEPARTMENTS- IN A MORE TIMELY WAY THAT'S REALLY PUBLIC HEALTH SPECIFIC AS WELL AND- AND REALLY IMPROVE WE'VE DEVELOPED REGIONAL- YOU KNOW. WORKING ANSWER SOME OF OUR STUFF SAID SIT IN ON THEIR REGIONAL MEETINGS TO REALLY HELP IMPROVE OUR COORDINATION THESE LOCAL COORDINATION TEAMS. AS WELL AS THE STRIKE TEAM SO- IT IS A CHALLENGE THE INFORMATION FLOW- AND THE MAGNITUDE. RELATION FLOWS WELL HAS BEEN CHALLENGING- SO I THINK- OFTEN WHEN THINGS ARE MOVING FAST I THINK YOU KNOW IN A GIVEN. YEAR VERY QUITE A QUESTION ANY GIVEN. OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT LEADER OF MAY NOT HAVE HEARD THE LATEST IF- THEY HAVEN'T KEPT UP WITH THEIR YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF EMAILS OR YOU KNOW WE TRY TO COMMUNICATE A LOT OF DIFFERENT. WAYS AND AGAIN WE CAN TO TRY TO IMPROVE THAT. AND I AND I HAVE BEEN LOOKING AT THE KALKA AND- SOME. DATA YOUR DASHBOARD. THE LAN AGREE DID OUT THERE BUT I JUST WONDER. IF PEOPLE ARE ARE YOU ABLE TO TRACK THE PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY UTILIZING IT. AND THEN ON OUR PURE DATA SYSTEMS ARE PEOPLE ACTUALLY IS THE INPUT GOING INTO BEING INTEGRATED I KNOW THERE'S BEEN. SOME LAG IF. A PROVIDER. HAS BEEN ACCEPTED. BUT THEY'RE NOT INTEGRATED INTO OUR OUR DATA. SYSTEM HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED YET. OTHER HAVE BEEN HOURS AND HOURS AND HOURS AS FAR AS YOUR YOUR LETTER QUESTION OF- IT'S TRUE YOU'RE RIGHT THERE'S DEFINITELY A DATA LAG AND GETTING- AS THE DATA AROUND DOSES ADMINISTERED INTO THE SYSTEMS AND I THINK THE OTHER CHALLENGES BEEN A FEW DIFFERENT SYSTEMS OTHERS THE FEDERAL SYSTEM WHICH IS THE VACCINE FINDER SYSTEM. WE HAVE OUR IMMUNIZATION REGISTRY BUT AGAIN THERE'S THREE DIFFERENT REGISTRIES- WHEN ONE STATEWIDE THE TO REGIONALS THAT ARE- SEPARATE AND THAT STARTED SEPARATELY AND WE HAVE- MATHIS AND AGAIN SO THERE'S BEEN A HUGE TEAM OF PEOPLE LIKE REALLY. LITERALLY WORKING CALLING- PROVIDERS AND TRYING TO GET ON THE GROUND DATA AND CONTINUE IMPROVE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE ISSUES THAT WE DISCOVERED THAT- HAVE BEEN CHALLENGES TO GET THAT DATA IN A MORE TIMELY WAY- THERE ARE REQUIREMENTS AS WELL ABOUT- INPUTTING THE DATA IN A TIMELY WAY TO THE- THE FEDERAL SYSTEM AND NOW OURS AND THAT'S ACTUALLY THE LATEST COMMUNICATIONS THIS WEEK ABOUT YOU KNOW YOU MUST MUST MUST. AND BE PUTTING THAT DATA AND PUTTING IT IN A TIMELY WAY- AND IT WILL IMPACT ACTUALLY DOWNSTREAM PROVIDERS ABILITY TO GET MORE VACCINE IF THEY'RE NOT IN PUTTING IT SO. WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD TO PROVE THAT I WE DO THINK YOU KNOW AND IT'S A CHALLENGE FOR EQUITY BECAUSE I THINK THERE ARE SOME. FRONTLINE PROVIDERS THAT ARE SERVING EXACTLY THE PEOPLE WE NEED THEM TO SERVE THE MOST BUT DON'T HAVE A ROBUST I. T. STRUCTURE SO THEY MIGHT BE PUTTING ON PAPER FIRST AND THEN THE NEW DATA ENTRY SO WE'RE ALSO WORKING TO. RESOURCE THAT AS WELL AND TRY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES SO THAT WE CAN STILL- AGAIN REGIONAL POPULATIONS THAT WE NEED TO THE MOST. AT THE DISTURBANCE WITH THE QUESTION DOCTOR PANEL ASKING ABOUT I. T. I MEAN IT'S I THINK THAT IS ONE OF. THE HUGE THINGS AND AS A AS A SOCIAL WORKER I WORK CLOSELY WITH PUBLIC HEALTH AND I KNOW WE HAVE BEEN UNDER RESOURCE AND I'VE HEARD WE'VE BEEN UNDER RESOURCE FOR A LONG TIME. AND NOW WE GO INTO A PANDEMIC ON AGAIN WE SEE THE RESULT OF NOT HAVING A ROBUST PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM. BUT AS WE ALSO KNOW THAT WITH DATA AND AS BIG AND DIVERSE IS OUR STATE IS THE DATA PART OF IT AND THE DATA SHARING PART OF IT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND YOU'RE RIGHT THOSE WITH THE GREATEST AGREES OF DISPARITIES ARE THOSE OFTENTIMES YOU DON'T HAVE. AT THE FACILITY OR THE STAFF OR JUST A TIME TO BE ABLE TO DO ALL THIS SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT BUILDING UP PUBLIC HEALTH WITH A COMPLETE STRUCTURE MEMBER. OUR OUR LOCALS ON THE GROUND AT AND- I KNOW AS I. WE DO AS YOU SAID. THINGS ARE ARE MOVING VERY SICK. AND THEN JUST FINE. IT BECAUSE IT WHEN INFORMATION GOES OUT A SO I GUESS MY QUESTION. WE'RE GOOD WHEN DO YOU THINK WE'LL GET TO THE POINT THAT WE'RE THE PEOPLE CAN EXPECT A VACCINATION. I KNOW WE HAD SAID STE YOU KNOW. HEALTHCARE WORKERS SIXTY FIVE AND THEN AND I KNOW THE- SOMETIMES WE'LL GET A THOUSAND DOSES A WEEK AND SOMETIMES YOU WON'T AND THEN I GOT A EMAIL THAT WENT OUT TO MY ENTIRE ONE OF MY BIGGEST SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT SAID. OF ALL EDUCATORS ARE GOING TO GET VACCINATED IN THE NEXT THREE WEEKS AND SOMEBODY ASK ME AM I GOT. I DIDN'T KNOW THAT- AND THEN THEY'RE LIKE IS IT TRUE WELL. IN AN EMAIL SAYS YOU KNOW DEPENDING ON SUPPLY BUT ARE WE GETTING INFORMATION THAT A MASSIVE AMOUNT IS COMING THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO. REALLY GO OUT AND- VACCINATE ALL OF OUR EDUCATORS IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS AND HOW HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO GETTING ALL OF OUR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS AND OUR FRONTLINE WORKERS VACCINATED BEFORE WE MOVED TO NEXT YEAR THAT I THINK IS IMPORTANT BUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT NOT TO GET PEOPLE'S HOPES UP. JUST TO THEN HAVE TO EXPLAIN- SORRY WE MADE A MISTAKE. WHICH IS NOT YOUR TURN- GREAT QUESTION I THANK YOU FOR THE PROMPT I ACTUALLY MEANT TO MENTION SORT OF- WE HAVE. I AM VERY HAPPY TO SAY WE HAVE VACCINES. OVER FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOSES OF THE ADMINISTERED. AND WE JUST HAVE THE ONE MILLION MARK FOR A ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE FULLY VACCINATED- YOUR OTHER POINT THAT AND THEN WE HAD ABOUT EIGHT MILLION DOSES DELIVERED AND I THINK THE OTHER. AND WE USED ABOUT TWO THIRDS OF THOSE JUST AS FAR AS WHAT WE HAVE IN OUR SYSTEM SO- WHAT'S THE ELIGIBLE POPULATION ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT SO WE HAVE ABOUT THREE MILLION ELIGIBLE HELP. PEOPLE IN PHASE ONE EIGHT WHICH IS THE HEALTHCARE WORKERS IN NURSING HOMES AND ABOUT A HALF MILLION IN THAT. YEAR WHEN INCLUDING TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS- IN AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. AS WELL AS- THEY WERE TO THE SERVICES RESPOND AS AND PEOPLE SIXTY FIVE YEARS OF AGE AND OLDER SO WE- WE DEFINITELY HAVE- MORE PEOPLE ELIGIBLE THEN SUPPLY THAT WE ARE GETTING AROUND ONE MILLION AND THEN INCREASE THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION DOSES A WEEK. IN THE NEXT COUPLE WEEKS SO YOU KNOW- SO AND THEN YOUR OTHER QUESTION IS WHEN DO WE THINK IT'LL REALLY BE MORE WHEN THE NUMBER WE HAVE BEEN HEARING YOU KNOW SPRING AS- THAT- THAT ALSO DEPENDS ON YOU KNOW THE NEXT. TO VACCINES THAT ARE MUCH CLOSER THAT JANSSEN. VACCINES AS- HAS SUBMITTED AN APPLICATION AND SHE'S NOT ATION THEY HAVE AN THAT- AND- REVIEW THAT AND THE BRAIN ARE SEEN TO. FIFTH BE. RIGHT NOW THAT HOPEFUL. AND THAT IS ACTUALLY WONDERS. THAT REALLY. HELP A LOT WHICH IS ARE. WE WANT TO SEE THAT. SO WE ARE HOPE. THAT THIS- YOU KNOW WE'LL HAVE MUCH MORE VACCINE ARE AT LEAST AN INCREASE SUPPLY- AND- CAN REALLY BE. HOPEFULLY SOON AFTER THAT BE ABLE TO OPEN UP TO A MUCH BROADER MALAYSIANS BUT I THINK YOU KNOW. AGAIN WORST RESTING TO AND WEBER WITH THE FEDERAL. SURPRISE WELL- WE DO HOPE TO BETTER OF. MATHIS HOW PEOPLE WE KNOW IN HERE YOU AS IS THAT. I MUST COMMON QUESTION AND ONE. FROM AND IT THE AND THEN ALL THE SUBJECT OF. OR SO WE HAD THIS GRAY SYSTEM ARE WE GONNA CONTINUE. TO USE THAT- AND I KNOW IT CANMAKE IT AND I CAN TALK MY COUNTY BUT IT'S BY EXAMPLE. THE IT'S A WE'RE GONNA START- VACCINATING PEOPLE DOWN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF STOCKTON BUT I HAVE. HERE IS UP LIKE IN THORTON ON THE NORTH SIDE OF SAN JOAQUIN COUNTY. THERE'S IT IS IT IS VERY ISOLATED ARE WE ABLE ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO USE THOSE CONTRACT RESEARCH GOING FORWARD. PERHAPS TO HELP WITH DISTRIBUTION. OR TO HELP WITH- IT IS VERY I ALSO BOUGHT A AG AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. I'M THAT REALLY NEED TO BE IN THERE AND MAY NOT HAVE THE SAME KIND ACCESS SO WHAT ARE WE DOING TO ACTUALLY REACH. A REAL COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. WHO WHO YOU KNOW MAY NOT KNOW HAVE A SMARTPHONE. MAY NOT KNOW THEY HAVE TO DRIVE YOU KNOW TWENTY MILES TELLS TO GO GET VACCINATED WHAT DO WE DO IT TO GET USES CONTRACTORS IN THIS SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP. TO GET OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND ON THE GROUND. YES I THINK- BOTH A THE STATE LEVEL USE THAT- WE CAN BE REJECT. SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES AREN'T THAT HAVE BEEN THE- ALONG LEVEL. SO WE- OUT TO PARENTS AND THAT'S ABOUT MANY THE- MANY- GROUND HAVE RE DIRECT. SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES TO HAVE A TECHNICIAN AND I THINK THAT IS THE OTHER PART WORKING CLOSELY WITH. OUR MINISTRY THERE ARE AROUND. I TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ENGAGE ONE- SIMILARLY COMMITTEE BASED ORGANIZATIONS PEOPLE ON THE GROUND WHO ARE TRUSTED BECAUSE YOUR ABSOLUTE RIGHT WE NEED TO HAVE INTERESTS AND- MSSENGERS ON. OUTREACH AND AGAIN CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE SO. THERE ARE A LOT OF- THAT'S A LOT OF WORK IN PROCESS WITH. OUR PRIME MINISTER TO HELP MAKE SURE WE ARE- FUNDING AND ENGAGING THOSE RESOURCES THAT ARE NEEDED TO REALLY RECHARGE. OKAY THEN JUST BEFORE I GO TO MAKE MY COLLEGES FROM I. GET IN MY HEAD. SO THE THIRD PARTY IS GOING TO BE DISTRIBUTING VACCINES. TO OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH. THEY'LL BE ALLOCATING. AND ALL THEN ONE THEY'RE OUT. THEN THE DISTRICT COMES TO THEM FROM THE- FROM IT- THE VACCINE. THE BOTTOM OKAY YES WILL BE ALLOCATED OKAY THANK. THANK THE GENERAL. BUT THANK YOU CHAIR I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- THE FIRST ONE IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE HAVE HAD- PRIVATE SCHOOLS WHO HAVE BEEN ABLE TO OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AND DOING SO FOLLOWING GUIDELINES IN KEEPING EVERYONE SAFE I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHY OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAVE NOT ALSO BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT THAT'S MY FIRST QUESTION YOU CAN. ANSWER THAT PLEASE AND THEN THEY'LL MOVE ON TO THE SECOND ONE. SO I THINK- AS YOU ALSO KNOW I THINK WE'VE BEEN REALLY WORKING REALLY DILIGENTLY AND CHEST- AS- SERVING OF A SAFE SCHOOLS HOUSE AND- HOLES SAY SCHOOLS TEMA TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND- ACTUALLY HAVEN'T HEARD THE LATEST STATUS ON ON THAT- THE POTENTIAL FUNDING THAT. THAT WE'RE HOPING CAN REPORTED THAT I THINK I THINK ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT ELEMENTS ARE ALL THERE I THINK WE HAVE REALLY- AS FAR AS THAT GOES- IT IS AN EFFORT THAT WE HAVE BEEN. ALSO REALLY- EXPLAINS CROSS- CROSS AGENCY- COLLABORATION WITH. AD IN THE STATE BOARD- WITH OSPINA AND HELLO SHAD TO COME UP WITH TACKLE SYSTEMS TEAMS TO HELP. THE SCHOOLS DIRECTLY AND LOCAL HEALTH. SYSTEMS WE'VE BEEN USING A LOT OF THESE ACTUALLY ARE CAL CONNECTS RESOURCE FOR CONTACT TRACING IS ALSO NOW- CREATING THESE PORTALS FOR SCHOOLS TO USE- SO THAT THEY CAN- WORK CLOSELY WITH LOVED NOT. HAVING TO NEW CASES INVESTIGATIONS AND THEN WE JUST- AND THAT DASHBOARD ABOUT WHICH SCHOOLS ARE ARE OPEN SO. WE'VE. BEEN ACTUALLY WORKING ON THAT I THINK- OKAY THIS IS ANOTHER OF. ALL COMMUTER ALL- ALL- IN APPROACH THE WE NEED TO WORK UNDER. TO THAT WE HAVE TO HEAR NOT PART BUSES BEGINNERS. ALL OF OUR SCHOOLS NOT THE- EMPIRE CHARTERS AND- WHAT DOCTOR PINE A PRE YOUR RESPONSE HOWEVER IT'S- IT'S BEEN A YEAR. AND A PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE ABLE TO OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION SAFELY. I STILL DON'T HAVE ANY ANSWERS TO WIRE PUBLIC SCHOOLS CANNOT CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THE HOLD UP IS BECAUSE THE DASHBOARD IS GREAT. AND TALKING ABOUT IT IS GREAT AND THAT'S WONDERFUL THAT EVERYBODY'S COMMUNICATING WHAT'S NOT HAPPENING IS THE EDUCATION IN THE CLASSROOM WHERE THE KIDS NEED TO BE SO CAN YOU. PROVIDE ME SOME CLARITY ON WHAT THE HOLD UP IS. I MEAN THE- WE HAVE PROVIDED GUIDELINES THAT- YOU KNOW WE ARE NOT RESTRICTED. SCHOOLS FROM THE OPENING WE ARE ENCOURAGING- YOU KNOW AGAIN WITH. THE PLANS AND SAFETY- TO PROVIDE YOU KNOW. THE GUIDANCE TECH ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOL THREE OF. BUT YOU ARE HELPING TO PROMULGATE THE REGULATIONS AND GUIDELINES BEHIND THESE TEARS RIGHT THE SYSTEM IS PUT IN PLACE A DETERMINES. WHAT CAN OPEN AND WHEN THEY CAN OPEN ARE YOU NOT INVOLVED WITH THAT. YES WE'RE DOING THAT FOR THE ENTIRE COMMUNITY RIGHT NOW SO AND WHAT THAT WAS MY POINT IS THAT. YOU'RE SAYING YOU'RE NOT PROHIBITING THEM FROM OPENING BUT REALLY YOU ARE BECAUSE YOU ARE. HELPING TO PUT TOGETHER THESE REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET. WHICH THEY CANNOT MEET WHICH MEANS THEY CAN'T OPEN SO- I JUST I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN HAVE PRIVATE SCHOOLS OPEN. AND THAT'S SEEMS TO BE FINDING GOING SMOOTHLY. BUT THE MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE LEFT TO LANGUISH AT HOME IN FRONT OF A LAPTOP COMPUTER AND IT IS BEEN A YEAR. TWENTY YEAR AND I DON'T SEE ANY END IN SIGHT AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE TEARS ON HERE. AND I SEE THE YELLOW TEAR WHICH IS ONE CASE OR LESS PER HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE IN EVEN IN THAT TIER. THERE ARE STILL SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS SO WHAT WILL IT TAKE. TO ALLOW PEOPLE TO OPERATE IN THE MANNER THAT THEY WOULD LIKE TO OPERATE WHAT WILL IT TAKE WILL IT TAKE COMPLETE ERADICATION OF. ANY AND ALL CORONAVIRUSES BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THAT HAPPENING. SO I WILL SAY THAT I DO THINK WHAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING REALLY CAREFULLY ON IS MAKING SURE WE HAVE AGAIN GUIDANCE FOR C. RAMBLINGS AND SUCCESSFULLY OPENINGS. AND OUR SCHOOL STAFF NEED TO FEEL COMFORTABLE RETURNING TO SCHOOL AND THAT IS- EXACTLY WHAT IS HEALTH AND FORM- THEY CAN AND WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF EDUCATION AND YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY IN THE LAST. FEW MONTHS OF- REALLY SHOWING- THAT YOU CAN DO THAT SAFELY IF YOU MASS YOU HAVE DISTANCING OF CONFEDERATION COHORTS- AND ALL THAT IS- THIS THING ORIGINAL BUT WE ALSO NEED OUR- SCHOOLS TO BILLS THEY FRIEDMAN RETURNING AND THAT IS. NOT AS YOU KNOW WHAT WE ARE WE HAVE WORKED ON IN ORDER TO. MAKE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOL. STAFF AND COMMUNITIES ALLSTATE. OKAY WELL I. THAT RESPONSE BUT IT SEEMS AS THOUGH. THIS IS ALREADY HAPPENING THAT IT IS HAPPENING SAFELY IN THE TEACHERS DO FEEL SAFE GOING BACK INTO THE CLASSROOM. BECAUSE THEY'RE ALREADY DOING IT IN THE PRIVATE SCHOOL SETTING. WE'RE JUST KEEPING THE PUBLIC SCHOOL KIDS THE VAST MAJORITY OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. FROM BEING ABLE TO DO SO AND I AM AS YOU CAN IMAGINE AND- I'M SURE CLEARLY SEE I'M VERY FRUSTRATED BY THAT AS ARE. A LOT OF PEOPLE- THAT THE SECOND QUESTION I HAVE RELATES TO STUDENT SPORTS. WE HAVE SEEN- YOU KNOW PROFESSIONAL SPORTS MAJOR SPORTS BE ABLE TO COMPLETE THEIR SEASONS WITHOUT- ANY MAJOR PROBLEMS. AND I AM WONDERING WHY WE ARE NOT- ALLOWING THAT. TO BE REPLICATED IN YOUTH SPORTS SO THAT THEY CAN GET BACK TO PLAYING SPORTS AS WELL CAN YOU ANSWER THAT QUESTION FOR ME. YOUR RELIGION RELEASE ARE USED SPORTS GUIDANCE AND AGAIN IT'S IT IS BASED ON DISEASE TRANSMISSION- LOOKING AT AGAIN BALANCING SAFETY WITH NOW WE HAVE SEEN A SUPPORT. AFTER RECREATION AND- KIDS UPSWING EXERCISE AND ACTIVITY I THINK WORK AND- GENERALLY TRYING TO BALANCE THAT WE'VE ALSO SEEN A LOT OF SPORTS OFFERINGS WE'VE SEEN SOME OLD INTERSTITIALS WITHOUT BREAKS AND ASK YOUR FRIEND ABOUT. SPECIALS AND I KNOW SOME OF THE COLLEGE TEAMS NOT CANCEL HAPPENED GAMES BECAUSE I'VE HAD SO MANY CASES SO. AGAIN WE YOU KNOW THIS AS I MENTIONED IN THE VERY BEGINNING I THINK WE HAVE A REALLY. TRY TO EMPHASIZE BALANCING AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH INTERVENTIONS TO MOVE- MINIMIZE DISEASE TRANSMISSION AND MINIMIZE THE IMPACT ON THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WITH ALSO KIND OF SAFELY. RE OPENING YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS PARTS OF OUR ACTIVITIES AS A SOCIETY AND ECONOMY AND IT IS A DIFFICULT BALANCE IN THIS VIRUS HEY- CAN TURN VERY QUICKLY SO I THINK THE- I DIDN'T EVEN TOUCH ON VARIANTS WHICH AGAIN WE ARE. ACTUALLY WORKING ON SOMETHING CREEK SURVEILLANCE FOR ARAFAT IN GAZA BORDER WILD CARDS THAT IS THE NEWEST FONG. AND THEN I CAN HOW THAT COULD. TURN US INTO ANOTHER SURGERY HOPING THAT THIS LAST WAS. THE LAST ONE BUT- OUR WHERE WE LET'S SEE WHAT. AND THESE OTHER VARIANTS THAT HAVE BEEN HOW. TEND TO BE MORE INFECTIOUS. OKAY FOR MY FOR QUESTION- AND GOING TO THE YELLOW T. IS THE MAY TO. NEW K. PER ONE THOUSAND IS LESS THAN ONE- AND I'M LOOKING AT THE RESTRICTIONS- YEAH I MEAN EVEN IN TIER ONE WHERE IT'S LESS THAN ONE CASE PER HUNDRED THOUSAND YOU HAVE CHURCHES CAN BE OPEN INDOORS BUT ONLY AT 50% CAPACITY. SO. IS IT THAT- UNTIL. WE GET RID OF THIS TIER SYSTEM AND IT'S ENTIRELY INTEGRITY. THAT THINGS WILL REVERT TO THE WAY THEY WERE PRE CAVITIES IS DRY UNDERSTAND THAT CORRECTLY THAT ONCE WE SAY WE NO LONGER NEED TO STEER SYSTEM AND EVERYTHING REVERTS TO PRE COVERED. RIGHT AND WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT YOU KNOW LOOKING AT THE BLUEPRINT AS YOU ARE SPEAKING AND YEAH VACCINES ARE REALLY OUR ANSWER TO GET THAT RIGHT AND SO WE NEED TO GET TO COMMUNITIES SO THIS IS WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT OUR FOCUS RIGHT NOW IS ON ACTIVATIONS. SO ONCE WE CAN GET TO COMMUNITY THEN WE CAN FINALLY GET TO A PLACE BEYOND THIS FRAMEWORK INTO THE GREENS ON BECAUSE IT ADDS VERY PURPOSEFUL THERE'S NOT A GREENS OUT HERE YET WE ARE. ONCE WE CAN GET TO COMMUNITY THAT IS WHEN WE GET TO A POST. POST PANDEMIC POST- PRINT WITH THOSE TEARS. OKAY WE ARE YES THE- RIGHT NOW- WELL THANK YOU FOR THE INFORMATION I WILL TELL YOU THAT ON A PERSONAL NOTE I FIND THAT THE FACT. THAT THERE ISN'T A GREEN TO EUROPE. A BIT OF A PESSIMISTIC VIEW- AND ONE THAT IS NOT LOST ON CALIFORNIANS BUT I THANK YOU VERY MUCH- FOR YOUR ANSWERS. AND ARKHIPOV I COULD JUST ASK A- THE FOLLOW UP TO THAT SO MY UNDERSTANDING WAS THAT THE SCHOOLS THAT WERE HAVE ALREADY OPENED WERE L. ABLE TO CONTINUE BUT THAT NO NEW SCHOOLS WHO WHO MET THE CRITERIA WERE NOT ALLOWED TO OPEN SINCE SINCE WE WERE ON LOCKDOWN HAS THAT NOW BEEN LIFTED AND OF SCHOOLS. ARE ABLE TO OPEN SAFELY THEY THEY ARE ABLE TO AT THIS POINT. SO ACT THE END OUR GUIDANCE ONE OF THAT BENCHMARKS IS BEING UNDER THE TWENTY FIVE VIEW STREET- HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY- BUT IF THE SCHOOL IS UNDER THAT AND MEETS ALL THE SORT OF GUIDELINES- TO SAFELY OPEN AND ITS ITS PHASE SO COULD BE EITHER SOME SCHOOLS ARE STARTING WITH TAKING THREE TWO ZERO OUR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS- AND SUBMITTING THEIR PUBLIC SAFETY PLANS KIND OF A COMBINATION OF- THE OSHA REQUIREMENTS AND THEN THE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE THEN THEY CAN REOPEN YES. EVEN IN A PUT IN EVEN IN A PERFECT HERE. YEAH IN THE POP CULTURE. A RATED FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER DAY. OKAY IT BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW AND I THINK WHAT IS HAPPENING PLACES SCHOOLS OPEN AND THEN AND WE ALL WE ALL WANT AND WE KNOW ESPECIALLY. ON WOMEN OF COLOR HAVE BEEN THE LARGEST GROUP TO FALL OUT OF THE WORK FORCE AND WE KNOW A LOT OF THAT IS BECAUSE OUR SERVICE INDUSTRIES AND THEY HAVE TO STAY HOME PEOPLE TO. STAY HOME WITH KIDS- BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF WE OPEN THEM TOO SOON AND THERE'S AN OUTBREAK AND IT'S EVEN HARDER ON FAMILIES TO HAVE TO. FIND CHILDCARE AND THEN NOT AND THEN AND GO BACK AND FORTH AND I THINK NOBODY WANTS THAT. AND I THINK YOU KNOW I THINK WE CONTINUE TO SEE EXAMPLES OF THIS TENSION WHICH IS WHAT MAKES IT SO DIFFICULT PEOPLE WANTING TO OPEN. AND SOMETIMES NOT BE COMPLIANT WITH GUIDELINES. AND THEN TRYING TO REALLY MAINTAINED THE SAFETY OF EVERYBODY GOING FORWARD SO- SO THANK YOU FOR THAT A DOCTOR PAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND- BACK ON IT'S NOT A DO I THANK YOU FOR. YOUR HARD WORK I KNOW THAT YOU NOT ONLY OF COURSE OUR STATE EPIDEMIOLOGIST YET STEP IN FOR A WHILE TO. ACTUALLY HELP. A RUNNER. FOR A PUBLIC HEALTH. AS WELL AS WELL AND- DURING DISCOUNT CODE PANDEMIC SO. CERTAINLY WANT TO RECOGNIZE YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS IN YOUR LEADERSHIP DURING THIS VERY DIFFICULT TIME- I DO WANNA. BASE ON- CONTACT TRACING AND- YOU DRESS SOME OF THAT IN YOUR REMARKS- IN A- SILVER ARE I GUESS OUR HOPE IS VACCINES AND- YEAH WE ARE STRUGGLING WITH A SHORTAGE OF VACCINES. I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT- THE VACCINES THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT WORD JUST APPROVED FOR- UNDER DELAYS FOR USE I GUESS AT THIS POINT IS IT OR EVEN AT TWO MONTHS NOW. SO YOU KNOW I. THINK IT'S EAGER AS WE ARE WE ALSO BE CONSCIOUS OF SOME THE TIME LINES BEHIND BEHIND THAT TOO- AS WELL AND WELL WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUR VACCINATION RATES UP AND I AND I WOULD POINT OUT. THAT- EVEN IF WE ABLE TO GET VACCINES TO EVERYONE WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A PERCENTAGE OF PEOPLE WHO MAY NOT WHO IN THE SAME WAY THEY REFUSE TO WEAR MASKS- AND CONTRIBUTE TO THE SPREAD ALSO MAY REFUSE TO GET VACCINATED. A WIN FOR SURE NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO VACCINATE THEIR CHILDREN. UNTIL THAT'S APPROVED AND WHILE CERTAINLY- THEIR- LIVES AT LESS RISK NOT ZERO RISK AT LESS RISK OF CODED- THAT- THEY MAY. ALSO PARTICIPATE AND THE SPREAD OF THE DISEASE AND FORTY UNTIL WE'RE ABLE TO VACCINATE ONLY SOME OF THEM. THAT'S STILL 20% OF POPULATION DEBTS- CAN REMAIN UNVACCINATED TOLD THOSE UNTIL THEY'RE PROVED SO THAT'LL TAKE A LITTLE TIME WE'RE TALKING SKILL MONTHS THAT'S STILL PRETTY FAST- BUT- SO IN THE MEANTIME I DID WANT TO TOUCH ON CONTACT TRACING I KNOW WE SPENT THE FUNDS FOR A CONTACT RECENT PLATFORM IN VIRTUAL CONTACT TRACING. CALAMY IT CETERA- WHAT CAN YOU JUST SPEAKTO OUR CONTACT TRACING CAPACITY I KNOW I KNOW THAT AND- THE NUMBER OF CASES WE HAD AND- JANUARY- IN DECEMBER. AND WE STILL HAVE A LOT OF CASES NOW I MEAN WE ARE DETAINED RIGHT DIRECTION BUT LET'S LET'S BE CLEAR I THINK WE'RE STILL ABOVE OUR SUMMER PEAK CELLS. BEFORE IN TERMS OF CASES AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG- BUT WHAT IS THE CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY CONTACT FACE PAZ KEYS SO WE ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND WHERE. THE CAL CASES ARE SPREADING ARE YOU ABLE TO DO IN DEPTH CONTACT TRACING WHAT DEGREE ARE PEOPLE COOPERATING ARE NOT COOPERATING WITH CONTACT RACING IN THE SAME WAY THAT PEOPLE AREN'T COOPERATING WITH MASKS AND- CLIPPING OF VACCINES WHICH IS ALSO LIMITING OUR ABILITY TO. BE ABLE TO OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS SO CAN YOU SPEAK TO. WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF OUR CONTRACTORS IN CAPACITY AND THE LEVEL COOPERATION WE'RE GETTING FROM PEOPLE. AND OUR ABILITY TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY HOW THIS DISEASE IS CONTINUING TO SPREAD. ESPECIALLY AS WORLD CONCERNED ABOUT NEW VARIANTS AS AS WELL. AND AND THEIR INSTRUCTIONS THERE SO THAT AGAIN. IS COMES FROM DATA FROM CONTACT RACING. YES SIR- THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER HANFORD. OF THE- RECOGNITION AS WELL AND- THEN- AS FAR AS OUR CONTACT USING I THINK A COUPLE THINGS ONE I JUST WANNA AGAIN ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHT THAT. THE SYSTEM AND YOU KNOW I WAS EMPHASIZING THE NEED FOR DAM SECTIONS AND THAT'S CAL CONNECTS THEM IS ABSOLUTELY- YOU KNOW. THEN A RAPID KIND OF UP SKILLING AND SOMETHING THAT WILL BE USED YOU KNOW BEYOND A CODED AND BAR MULTIPLE DISEASES I THINK. YOU KNOW INNER IS REALLY COMFORTING EMPIRE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM AND HAVING A CONTACT DATABASE- WHICH WE DIDN'T HAVE STATEWIDE SO THAT'LL BE VERY THIS WOMAN PARTY THINK. YOU'RE A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT DURING THE MIDDLE THE SURGE YOU KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE REALLY CONTACT AND WE DO HAVE SOME DATA. YOU KNOW THAT- A COMBINATION OF. JUST THE ABSOLUTE NUMBERS MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO REACH- CASES AND CONTACTS AND SO I THINK AT THE PEAK OF. THINGS YOU KNOW IT SOMETIMES WAS LESS THAN HALF OF CASES ARE CONTACT MIGHT BE- RESPONDING TO- TO REACH S THEY THINK THE OTHER TECHNOLOGY THINGS THAT LEVERAGE BUT AGAIN. THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY RICH ARTISTRY OPERATION BUT WE DO HAVE THIS CALIFORNIA NOW TO FIND OUT. I ALSO HAVE- A VIRTUAL AGENT. AND WE'RE DOING MORE MORE INTERNET TO LINK THAT TO YOUR- LABORATORY TESTING- DATA RESULTS SO THAT WHEN SOMEONE GETS NOTIFIED OF THEIR TEST RESULTS THEY CAN ALSO GET. CODE TO RESPOND TO THAT SORT OF A MARKET SURVEY IF THEY ARE TECH SAVVY AND- AGAIN. WE HAVE THIS IN BOTH ENGLISH AND SPANISH NOW- BUT THAT IS A WAY TO KIND OF LEVERAGE THAT TECHNOLOGY AND HELP LOCAL. ARTS PRIORITIZE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF I'M PATTERSON THAT- I THINK THAT IF YOU WANT SPECIFICS ABOUT. SOME OUR METRICS I'M HAPPY TO. I'M NOT FINDING WEEK FIND TO YOU. YOU GET A MONTH DATA THAT WE SYSTEM THAT IN THE CITY'S. ON THE PERCENT OF CASE THAT ARE IN. WITH YOU KNOW ONE IN JUNE. AND THEN I OF CONS OR- IN WITHIN A DAY AND- AND HOW WE GET HAS. SO WE FOLLOWING WE CREATE. I THINK IT IS DEFINITELY CHEN IN THE A START BUT I THINK. IS DUE TO- REACT WHERE I. REAL AT THAT AS WELL WITH THE- AND KIND OF. IS THE CAPACITY NEEDED BIRTH I'M THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE WORK FORCE AND- KIND OF RE LOOKING AT THAT WE HAD PROJECT AND I THINK THE- ENTIRE TEAM RIGHT AWAY. ARRIVAL HAD LOOKED AT- THE CAPACITY AND NEEDING TO HAVE YOU KNOW X. NUMBER OF- CONTACT TRACERS FOR EXTRA PIECES- SO WE'RE KIND OF RE LOOKING AT THAT AS WELL. WITH HONORS AND UPDATES. AND LESSONS LEARNED OVER THE LAST. OKAY THANKS YEAH I APPRECIATE THAT. YOU COULD- SHARES. OF THAT AND- I'D KNOW IF THE- SOME OF THOSE METRICS ARE PUBLICLY. OR NOT BUT CERTAINLY BE INTERESTED IN. THE MARKET AND I KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD- I'M GOING TO- CONVERSATIONS ABOUT IT. I WOULD ALSO JUST MAKE NOTE THAT- WELL- YOU KNOW I THINK MY- GOOD FRIEND- WHO TALKED ABOUT DO WE HAVE TO WAIT TO GET TO ZERO- WE MAY NOT AND- AND- YOU KNOW THAT'S THAT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION I WOULD POINT OUT THAT ACTUALLY THERE ARE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE GOTTEN. PRETTY CLOSE TO ZERO. AND WHAT THEY'VE DONE IS THAT- SO FOR EXAMPLE IN AUSTRALIA. WHEN THEY HAVE AN OUTBREAK THEY ACTUALLY CLOSE EVERYTHING DOWN UNTIL THEY GET DOWN TO ZERO THEY DON'T. OPEN THE THINGS UP WHEN THINGS ARE LOWER DAY ACTUALLY WAIT TILL THEY GET IT DOWN TO ZERO SOMEONE MILBORNE HAD OUTBREAK THEY- COLLECT EVERYTHING DOWN UNTIL ZERO. I WAS ELECTED THE THING DOWN. THEY DON'T ALLOW YOU KNOW THEY DON'T ALLOW PEOPLE RUN AROUND WITHOUT MASKS AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS THEIR PEOPLE SO- I HOPE. YOUR HELP WE CAN. MAYBE THAT'S A POLICY THAT- THAT WE CAN ALL AGREE ON OR SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE- IF WE REALLY ARE SERIOUS ABOUT THIS. IS THAT- YEAH WE KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- WE'VE SEEN OTHER COUNTRIES DO IT THE QUESTION IS THAT. DO WE HAVE THE WILL TO DO THAT. HERE NOW IT'S A LITTLE CHALLENGING FOR A STATE TO DO IT ALONE- BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE CAN'T. STOP PEOPLE FROM COMING ACROSS OUR BORDERS. FROM OTHER STATES- BUT- I THINK THAT IF PEOPLE ARE SERIOUSLY- WANTED HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT TRYING TO REOPEN SCHOOLS AND BUSINESSES. HOPEFULLY THEY ALSO WILL BE SERIOUS ABOUT SUPPORTING THINGS LIKE REQUIRING PEOPLE TO WEAR MASKS AND- ENFORCING DISTANCE- PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS. ARE SOMEONE WE- GIVE PEOPLE PASSES TO VIOLATE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS- WE ARE ESSENTIALLY UNDERMINING ABILITY TO STOP THIS. A PANDEMIC. AND PEOPLE OF DUNDAS OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE THIS WITHOUT THE VACCINES EVEN. SELF CERTAINLY WE'RE GOING TO WORK ON VACCINATIONS AND- BUT- IN THE MEANTIME UNTIL WE TRY TO GET TO THE PLAY. WHERE COMMUNITY WHICH WILL TAKE US A WHILE I MEAN EVEN. ONCE THE EVEN ONCE WE GET ENOUGH VACCINE FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS IT WE STILL HAVE WORK TO DO EVEN BEYOND THAT TO GET TO THAT PLACE- WE ARE. GOING TO- NEED TO. INVEST IN THAT. MAYBE JUST ONE OTHER. QUESTION AND I DON'T KNOW WHETHER IT'S HERE AND- WELL MAYBE DOES THAT ALLEN'S ASK IT NOW- WHAT KIND OF INVESTMENTS ARE WE MAKING AND I'M TRYING TO LOOK AT THE- AGAIN THE BUDGET PROPOSAL ENTER AND- MAYBE. NOT IN THIS SECTION BUT- IN TERMS OF THAT EDUCATION PIECE RIGHT WE- WE YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO PERSUADE THE L. WE NEED TO EDUCATE PEOPLE ABOUT THE VACCINES AND ANSWER DIRT LEGITIMATE QUESTIONS THEY HAVE ABOUT THE VACCINES. AND SO FORTH- AND- I CAN SO CAN WE SPEAK TO WHAT. WHAT'S HER. AND I KNOW SOME OF THAT'S KIND OF. YOU KNOW HAPPENED SHOULD BE HAPPENING NO NOT WAITING TILL JULY FIRST BUT- CAN SPEAK TO WHAT KIND OF FUNDING AND RESOURCES ARE PUTTING INTO THAT- EDUCATION EFFORT- TO. ADDRESS VACCINE HESITANCY. SO SHOULD THE SCHOOLS FUNDING ACTUALLY WONDERING IF THERE'S- SOME NOT GOVERNOR'S OFFICE DIDN'T RESPOND I KNOW I BELIEVE THERE'S AN ACT OF SORT OF- BUDGET REQUESTS. AS WE SPEAK VETERANS IS BEING REVIEWED- AND I WANT TO SAY IT'S OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS. AT THE END OF OUT FINANCES THERE CAN YOU SPEAK TO THAT WHAT WHAT KIND OF. BUDGET PROPOSAL IS THEREFORE- DRESSING VACCINE HESITANCY. HELLO I'M SORRY YES MA'AM ACTION HAS AND SEE. SOME OF THE SCHOOLS NOW TALK ABOUT VACCINE HESITANCY SO WE WE'RE SO WHAT HAPPENED IS RIGHT NOW WE DO HAVE THE VACCINES FOR ALL THE PEOPLE WANT THEM AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO. EVERYONE'S ASKING ABOUT HOW CAN I GET MY VACCINE AT SOME POINT WE'RE GOING TO HIT A POINT WHERE ACTUALLY EVERYONE WHO WANTS. ONE IT'S GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE TO GET ONE TO HAVE. I BELIEVE IN NOT THAT WILL EVENTUALLY HAPPENED THEN ARE ISSUES GOING TO BE. WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO ARE- DECLINED THE VACCINES SO NOW MANY OF THEM ACTUALLY MAYBE JUST. WANTING TO WAIT A LITTLE WHILE BUT FOR EXAMPLE I THINK THERE'S SOME DATA THAT SHOWS THAT- IN OUR NURSING HOMES- IS. THE CVS WALGREENS PROGRAM THERE'S BEEN SOME REPORTS- THAT THE VACCINE TAKE UP RATE. IS ONLY ABOUT. A LITTLE OVER A THIRD. THAT THAT ACTUALLY OVER HALF OF PEOPLE HAVE DECLINED THE VACCINE TO WORK YOU WORK IN THE NURSING HOMES- I THINK LA TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT- I THINK JUST A LITTLE OVER HALF OF THEIR FIREFIGHTERS HAVE. ACTUALLY BEEN OFFERED THE VACCINE OF ACTUALLY TAKING IT. SO WE HAVE SOME WORK TO DO AND I. AND I. YEAH I THINK SOME OF THE NAY THIS PEOPLE ARE LIKE OKAY YOU'LL NEED TO GIVE ME ANOTHER MONTH AND LET'S SEE WHAT HAPPENS ALL THE PEOPLE I KNOW WHO GOT INTO A FINE I'LL GET MINE. BUT YOU KNOW THAT THAT DOES SPEAK TO THE NEED TO. EDUCATE THE ALSO WE DO KNOW THAT THERE WE HAVE SOME CHALLENGES EVEN WE CAN OFFER PEOPLE VACCINES THAT. SOME OF THESE GROUPS THAT HAVE ENABLED OFFERED THAT THERE ARE RATES OF VACCINE HESITANCY OUT THERE. AND AS WE TRY TO KEEP. COMMUNITY WE NEED TO DEAL WITH THAT. BURGER UPON THIS IS A DOCTOR TO. NOT ONE. THANK YOU- THANK YOU FOR THE PERSON I WAS. BRIEFED YESTERDAY- THERE IS A LARGE CAMPAIGN THAT'S THAT THAT'S THE UNDER WAY. AT THE MOMENT. AND THEY'VE DONE EXTENSIVE BOTH. A RESEARCH OF THE LITERATURE. AND THEY'VE GATHERED CONDUCTING FOCUS GROUPS WITH OVER A THOUSAND PEOPLE TO DEAL TO DEAL WITH THE- WHOLE ISSUE IS HOW DO WE- GET PEOPLE TO GET VACCINATED AND THERE'S IN THERE SPECIFICALLY DEALING WITH THE ISSUE OF VACCINE HESITANCY. IN DIFFERENT IN DIFFERENT- PRIORITY POPULATIONS- AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA BE GETTING. ADDITIONAL BRIEFINGS AND DATACOM. AND SO WE CAN SEND THAT INFORMATION WE CAN COMPILE THAT INFORMATION AND SEND IT OVER TO YOU. OKAY I WOULD APPRECIATE IT. I DID I DID THIS IS BUDGETS OF KATIE WAS ASKING ABOUT WHAT'S THE BUDGETARY ALLOCATION IT'S GOING TO BE. GOING AT THAT WERE- COMMITTEE TO DIS EFFORTS AS WELL. SO IF. WE DON'T HAVE THAT READILY AVAILABLE AT THAT THE APPRECIATE IF YOU COULD. SHARE THAT WITH THE SUBCOMMITTEE. YEAH OKAY YOU FOR I THIS IS IT'S NOT OUT OF THE UNIQUE BUDGET BUT THE REST LARGER UNDERWAY. OKAY THANK YOU I WAS SURE WHERE IT WAS IN THE BUDGET THAT SIDE THAT RECOGNIZE THAT ASSETS HERE IN THE HOPES THAT- MAYBE SOME CONTRACT IN RIGHT DIRECTION OAY THANK YOU. YEAH WE'LL GET THAT- IT AND A FINAL QUESTION BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL AS WELL- BIG KNOWLEDGE IN THAT. THAT AGAIN WE HAVE THAT. WE HAVE A VERY DIVERSE STATE WITH A LOT OF FAT DIVERSE IDEAS THAT HAVE OFTENTIMES LED US TO NOT BEING ABLE TO. OPEN MORE EFFECTIVELY- THE ISSUE OF PEOPLE NOT BEING NON COMPLIANT WITH MASKS OR NON YOU KNOW THAT THERE AND WE HAVE OUR LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS PARTICIPATING IN- PRESS CONFERENCES- THING OPENS UP SO WE HAVE A LOT OF EVEN OUR LEADERS WHO WHO HAVE NOT BEEN COMPLAINT WAS SAFETY GUIDELINES. HAVE WE- I WE CONSIDERED- WHEN WE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WORKING WITH TRUSTED ADVISORS AT THAT. AT RISK COMMUNITIES HAVE WE CONSIDERED. THEM AND THE VACCINE HESITANCY DO WE HAVE A STRATEGY FOR ACTUALLY. ADDRESSING ADDRESSING THE VERY NON COMPLIANT LARGE LARGE GROUPS. SMALL GROUPS TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT WITH THAT THAT HAS ACTIVELY SPREAD DISINFORMATION- TO ACTUALLY TARGET SOME OF THOSE THOSE GROUPS AND I KNOW YOU KNOW FARMWORKERS IMPORTANT PEOPLE OF COLOR LOW SOCIAL ECONOMIC BUT WE ALSO KNOW. THROUGH THROUGH THIS YEAR THAT THE- THE MISINFORMATION THE ALTERNATIVE FACTS IF YOU WELL I HAVE HAVE HAVE LED. HAVE WENT TO THE CONTINUED SPREAD AND THE LACK OF IS BEING ABLE TO GET CONTROL OF THIS. DO WE HAVE A PLAN AND IS THEIR PLACE IN THE BUDGET THAT ACTUALLY TARGETS- THE POPULATION WHO COULD ALSO SAY IS AT RISK AND PUTS THE REST OF US AT RISK- I CAN. GET A HIGH LEVEL. HOLSTERED COMMUNICATIONS TEAM NOW WITH THE VACCINE LPGA FRAMEWORK- JUST AREN'T ON THE NORMALIZATION KAGHAN SHANNON TO REALLY WORK ON VACCINE HESITANCY. HEARING AS DOCTOR RUNS AND- IN FOCUS GROUPS THAT REALLY LOOKING AT- THERE IS A VACCINE HESITANCY AND SORT OF REALLY CREATING MESSAGES AND WORKING WITH JUST MESSAGES AND THEN THERE'S A WHOLE. PACKAGE THAT JUST CAME OUT I JUST DON'T HAVE THE DOLLAR AMOUNT TO WORK WITH STUDIOS SPECIFICALLY PROBLEM REASONS UNDER YOUR ARM IS BEING TO REALLY WORK. MESSENGERS AND- WITH OUR LOCAL PARTNERS AND TO COUNTER MISINFORMATION I THINK WEALSO HAVE STARTED THAT COMMUNICATIONS TEAM IS ACTUALLY MONITORING DOING SOME OF THAT SOCIAL MEDIA MINING. LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION AND I'M TRYING TO COUNTER IT WITH- WITH YOU KNOW ACTUAL AS FACTS AND THEN AS AS WE ALL KNOW AND I KNOW. SENATOR HANDLES WELL TO AND WORKING MOST BECAUSE OF THE STRESS MASTERS BECAUSE SOMETIMES THE FACTS ARE NOT WILL COMPEL PEOPLE THEY'RE TRYING TO FIND SINCE AND CHAMPIONS WITHIN THE COMMUNITY- SO THERE'S DEFINITELY HUGE EFFORT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT. WE WERE THAT GOV OFFICE AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE HE ALREADY TALKED. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IF I PAN IS EVERYTHING I THINK- I THINK WE HEARD FROM DEPARTMENT FINANCE BUT. THE L. A- BEFORE WE GO TO OUR PANEL. HEY HI MADAM CHU IN MEMBERS AND SO NEED. FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S. I HAVEN'T- COMMON- RELATED TO DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET WHEN IT COMES TO THE CO IN NINETEEN- WE KNOW THAT FROM A BUDGETARY PERSPECTIVE MOST OF THE PUBLIC NINETEEN RESPONSE WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC. PUBLIC HEALTH BUDGET IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE ENACTED TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. OR IN THE PROPOSED TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET. AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE ADMINISTRATION IS ADJUSTMENTS. AND IT'S CLEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET RELEASED IN JANUARY THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IT CITES THE NEED TO MAINTAIN FLEXIBILITY S A RESPONSE TO A CONSTANTLY EVOLVING PANDEMIC. AND THE ENGINE AND PROVIDED TODAY HAS A VERY THOROUGH DESCRIPTION OF THE WAYS THE ADMINISTRATION AUGMENTED FUNDING- SINCE ENACTMENT OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. I'D ALSO LIKE TO DESCRIBE HOW PROPOSES TO MAKE ME YEAR ADJUSTMENTS IN THE BUDGET YEAR. THE COUPLE IMPORTANT THINGS TO NOTE THERE WHEN THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES A NEW CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE. WHICH WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO ARGUMENT FUNDING DECREASE FUNDING OR TRANSFER FUNDING BETWEEN A SELECT NUMBER OF DEPARTMENTS. IT WOULD ALSO ALLOW- FOR EXPENDITURE OF FEDERAL FUNDS IN THESE- DEPARTMENTS IMPORTANTLY- TO KNOW THOUGH IS THAT THIS CONTROL SECTION DOES NOT INCLUDE A NOTIFICATION. OF THE LEGISLATURE PROVISION- THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO PROPOSES TO EXTEND- THE AUTHORITY ALLOWED THROUGH THE- DISASTER RESPONSE EMERGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT. IT PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE TRIO- THROUGH THE- THROUGH THE ENTIRE BUDGET YEAR OTHERWISE THE AUTHORITY TO SPEND FUNDS THROUGH THIS ACCOUNT WHICH WOULD EXPIRE AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. I'M IN ADDITION WE ALSO MENTION THAT BECAUSE THE STATE IS UNDER A DECLARED STATE OF EMERGENCY IT'S ALLOWED TO FOREGO THE FORMAL COMPETITIVE PROCUREMENT PROCESS FOR PUBLIC CONTRACTS. AND SO JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE THE ADMINISTRATION IS USED AS SOME SINCE THE START OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY FOR EXAMPLE- ENTERING INTO A CONTRACT OF PERKINELMER TO OPEN THE VALENCIA BRANCH LAB- THROUGH A NO BID CONTRACTING PROCESS- WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO RELY ON THIS PROCESS THROUGH- THROUGH THE END OF THE STATE OF EMERGENCY. NOW- WE JUST KNOW THAT BECAUSE MANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES ARE HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THE ANNUAL BUDGET PROCESS THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH TO EXPRESS ITS GOALS AND PRIORITIES. A PARTICULARLY- YEAH POTENTIALLY AHEAD OF THE MAY REVISION SO SOME OPTIONS FOR HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO THAT- GIVEN THAT SO MANY OF THESE THINGS ARE HAPPENING OUTSIDE OF THE BUDGET PROCESS. IT CAN SEND LETTERS TO THE ADMINISTRATION IT CAN REQUEST INFORMATION BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE HEARINGS AS IT STANDS TODAY- IT CAN ADD PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE TO THE BUDGET. IT CAN REQUIRE ROBUST REPORTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATION WHEN IT RESPONDS TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S NOTIFICATIONS OF ACTION- IT COULD ALSO REQUEST MODIFICATIONS TO THE PROPOSED CONTROL SECTION LANGUAGE TO REQUIRED NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE ENSURE CHOIR THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE SPECIFIC INFORMATION WHEN IT IS MAKING A MAJOR ADJUSTMENT. SO AS HAS BEEN NOTED ALREADY IN THE DISCUSSION TODAY THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE ASKED TO RESPOND QUICKLY- AND IT YOU KNOW TO BOTH THE MAY REVISION AS WELL AS POTENTIAL- MID YEAR. ACTIONS AND- WE SUGGEST THAT THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS SOME CRITERIA AS IT ASSESSES THESE PROPOSALS- FOR EXAMPLE IT SHOULD CONSIDER THE IMPORTANCE AND RELEVANCE OF ANY PROPOSED ACTION AND HOW IT FITS INTO THE STATE'S OVERALL COVERAGE NINETEEN RESPONSE. IT COULD BE A CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY GIVEN PROPOSAL AND WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION HAS PROVIDED ENOUGH INFORMATION- TO SHOW WHY AND HOW THE PROPOSED ACTION MIGHT BE EFFECTIVE. IT COULD CONSIDER THE FEASIBILITY OF ANY PROPOSED ACTIONS SO JUST TO GIVE AN EXAMPLE HERE. IF THE PROPOSED ACTIONREQUIRES THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE LOCAL PUBLIC% HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAS THAT BEEN PROPERLY ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE PROPOSAL. EQUITY IS ANOTHER IMPORTANT CRITERION- AND JUST TO CONSIDER WHETHER ANY PROPOSED ACTION WOULD HAVE A DISPARATE IMPACTS ON VARIOUS GROUPS IN THE STATE. AND THEN FUNDING AND CONTRACTING WOULD BE ANOTHER AT KEY CRITERION TO USE IN ASSESSING PROPOSALS FOR EXAMPLE WHETHER THAT FUNDING. IS ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT AND- AND IS BEING IMPLEMENTED IN A WAY THAT WOULD MAKE IT ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT. WE ALSO- IN CLOSING I JUST WANTED TO KNOW IF YOU ISSUES TO CONSIDER ONCE THE STATE BEGINS TO ENTER THE RECOVERY PHASE FROM THE pALREADY BEEN MENTIONED TODAY AND WE DO SO WE WOULD JUST UNDERSCORE. OF THESE ISSUES ONE IS TO CONSIDER- WHAT WILL BE NEEDED IN TERMS OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN THAT CONTINUED AN ONGOING RESPONSE TO COVERT NINETEEN. AND WHETHER THE ADMINS- THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO CONSIDER- HOW TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED DURING THE PANDEMIC. EITHER IN THE NEAR TERM OR ON AN ONGOING BASIS SO THIS COULD INCLUDE. THE VILLAGE HE WENT BRANCH LAB IT COULD INCLUDE- AS SUSTAINING SOME OF THE WORK FORCE THAT'S BEEN ADDED. AT THE LOCAL AND STATE LEVEL. ANOTHER KEY ISSUE TO CONSIDER IS WHAT- ACTIVITIES PUBLIC HEALTH RELATED ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN DEFERRED- AS THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS RESPOND TO THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT WOULD BE TAKE. WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED TO RECOVER IN THOSE AREAS. AND FINALLY WEWOULD RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE FUND AND A COMPREHENSIVE AFTER ACTION REVIEW- OF THE PANDEMIC I MEAN THE PANDEMIC HAS REVEALED A NUMBER OF. DIFFERENT PROBLEMS IN THE STATE INCLUDING UNDER RESOURCE STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. A RACIAL AND ETHNIC DISPARITIES- COORDINATION PROBLEMS- IN PUBLIC HEALTH GOVERNANCE STRUCTURES- AS WELL AS AN OUTDATED IT SYSTEMS SO. WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER USING SOME OF THE ONE TIME- WINDFALL AVAILABLE THIS YEAR TO FUND. COMPREHENSIVE ACT AFTER. ACTION REVIEW AND ASSESSMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT HOW DO WE TAKE THIS HUNG UP ONCE IN A CENTURY- OCCURRENCE- RECOVER FROM IT AND COME OUT STRONGER WITH WHAT WE'VE LEARNED. DR AS APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION BY L. L. I HOPE TO AND IT'S LARGER AND JUST A SUBCOMMITTEE BUT- AND I THINK I'VE MENTIONED IT IN OUR- BUDGET OVERVIEW BUT- I WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE ELYASAND PUT IT ON HOW WE MANAGE- SUGGESTIONS ON CONTROLLING WHICH I THINK THERE WERE SOME CONCERNS LAST YEAR ABOUT THE TRAIL OF PROCESS- NOW WE HAVE EXPERIENCE WITH IT ON A LONG TERM BASIS AND IT WASN'T REALLY DESIGNED FOR A STATE OF EMERGENCY AND ONGOING PANDEMIC GOES MORE FOR SHORT TERM- WELL THERE'S ONLY A LONG TAIL SAID THESE YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE WILDFIRES OR EARTHQUAKES AND OTHER TYPES OF- EVENTS- WHAT WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE TAILOR OUR- OVERSIGHT- FOR THE NATURE OF. THIS PARTICULAR EMERGENCY WHICH IS AN ON GOING- SAID WERE- GET PAST YEAR NOW AND SO WOULD APPRECIATE LA IS- SUGGESTIONS AND INPUT INTO HOW WE CAN. GO ABOUT THIS DOING THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT I THINK WE'LL NOW MOVE ON TO OUR PANEL THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH. AND FROM OUR PANEL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE. REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS HOSPITALS CLINICS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. C. P. AGN AND SEIU FROM A LABOR PERSPECTIVE AS WELL SO WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM EVERYBODY. WITH THEIR EXPERIENCE AND PERSPECTIVE WELCOME PLEASE INTRODUCE YOURSELF BEFORE YOU PRESENT THE START WITH HOSPITAL'S FIRST ON OUR LIST. THE MORNING CAN YOU HEAR ME OK THIS IS DJ YES. YES YES YES GREAT GOOD MORNING. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MIGHT BE JEOPARDIZED IN THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR NURSING CLINICAL SERVICES FOR THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITALIZATION THE STATION. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY TALKING ABOUT THE HOSPITAL EXPERIENCE OVER THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. WHEN COVER NINETEEN CAME TO CALIFORNIA MORE THAN A YEAR AGO HOSPITALS WERE ON THE FRONT LINES OF OUR STATE'S RESPONSE REALLOCATING STAFF AND SPACE TO CARE FOR THE EMERGING COVERED CASES. AND DEVELOPING INNOVATIVE METHODS TO SAFELY PROVIDE CARE TO ALL PATIENTS THEIR TELEHEALTH AND HOSTILE HOMES PROGRAMS AMONGST MANY HOSPITALS RECONFIGURED IN ADVANCE AND SERVICES SUCH AS ADDITIONAL ICE YU INVEST IN NONTRADITIONAL AREAS LIKE PACKED USING CLOSE UNITS. MANY HOSPITALS USE LOBBYIST GIFT SHOP SPACE AT COPE WITH THAT CAPACITY IN EDIE'S. PUT UP TENTS TO RECONFIGURE COVENTRY I JUST MANAGED MASSIVE PATIENT INFLUX AND INFECTION CONTROL NEEDS. HOSPITALS QUICKLY PURCHASES MUCH PROTECTED AND CLINICAL EQUIPMENT IS AVAILABLE AND THEY COMPETED WITH THE WORLD FOR THIS PRODUCT WHICH MADE IT VERY DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN. WHEN PROPER PP AND RESOURCES SUCH AS THAKSIN BECAME SCARCE HOSPITALS FOUND WAYS TO ENSURE STAFF AND PATIENTS STAFF AND PATIENTS WERE SAFE AS POSSIBLE GIVEN THE RESOURCES ON HAND. AZUL'S HIRED AND TRAINED MORE STAFF WHENEVER POSSIBLE TO ANY AND ALL AVAILABLE TRAVELING INTEMPERATE TEMPORARY AGENCIES ACROSS. THE U. S. WHAT FRONT LINE CARE NAY HAAS WILL PROVIDED HOUSING CHILD. NIELSEN TRAINING. ALL OF THIS DONE IN A TIMELY HOSPITAL HAD JUST THERE'S IN MY AND POINTY NURSING EXAMPLE IS A AS ADDING SUPPORT. TO K. FOR THE- INCREASING OF PATIENTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BROUGHT THE PANDEMIC HOSPITALS HAVE BEEN AIDED IN THEIR WORK TO SAVE LIVES REGULAR COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS. THIS MAN IS ON THAT ON A WHOLE CALIFORNIA'S PANDEMIC RESPONSE IS AND HAS BEEN STRONG. THE STATE PUBLIC HEALTH LEADERS NURSES DOCTORS HOSPITALS AND OTHER SHOULD BE PRAISED FOR THEIR PERSEVERANCE AND- RESILIENCE. WELL THE ABSENCE OF HOSPITALS AND OTHERS HAVE UNDOUBTEDLY SAVED LIVES THERE ARE MANY LESSONS TO BE LEARNED IN ACCESS TO BE TAKEN TO MAKE SURE STATE IS READY FOR WHATEVER DISASTER COMES NEXT. WE IN CALIFORNIA NAY TIRE WORLD WERE OVERWHELMED BY THE SCOPE AND IMPACT OF THIS PANDEMIC AND WE MUST RETHINK OUR CORPORATIONS. WE NEED TO INVEST MORE IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE AND EXPERTISE INCLUDING MODERNIZE MARGIN SCALABLE DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS. CALIFORNIA'S DISASTER RESPONSE NEEDS TO BE RETHOUGHT AND REDESIGNED IN SEVERAL WAYS. WE MUST RECONSIDER HOW WE RESPOND TO REGIONAL VERSUS STATEWIDE DISASTERS- WE MUST RECONFIGURE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY IN DECISION MAKING BETWEEN COUNTIES TO THE STATE WE NEED ALIGNMENT AND DECISION MAKING ACROSS FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THREE CITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO REDUCED AND CONSISTENCY CONFUSION DELAYS BARRIERS AND INEQUITY. WE NEED TO DEVELOP AN ALTERNATIVE TO CURRENT MUTUAL AID SYSTEM WHICH IS NOT WORKING A PANDEMIC WHEN EVERYONE IS IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE AND THERE'S NO EXTRA RESOURCE TO OFFER TO OTHERS. CONSIDER WHAT IS WE NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT IS CRITICAL IN ANY DISASTER FOR EXAMPLE FOCUSING ON EMERGENCY SERVICES IN AN EARTHQUAKE. STOCKPORT STOCKPILING PP FOR INSECTS DISEASE PREPARATIONS OR TRIAGE PROTOCOLS FOR MASS CASUALTIES. AND FINALLY WE NEED TWO INVEST MORE IN. PUBLIC AND FOR. AN EXPERT. AND MODERN LARGE AND- DATA ACROSS NOW. BASED ON THE LATEST TECH. A WITH FEDERAL EFFORTS. CHF PROCESS THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO PRESENT HOW WE'VE BEEN ATTACKED AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO ONGOING COLLABORATION TO STRENGTHEN OUR DISASTER RESPONSE. THANK YOU. I KNOW THE HOSPITAL'S EVER HAVE THAT HAVE HAVE BEEN HORRIBLY IMPACTED ANNA AND WE THANK ALL OF YOUR STAFF AND ALL OF THE WORK THAT'S THAT'S GOING ON AT THE SAME TIME YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO DO A LOT OF THE THINGS THAT THAT SUPPORT A HOSPITAL TO BE ABLE TO KEEP ITS DOORS OPEN. SO WE APPRECIATE THAT YOU HAVE REALLY BEEN ON THE FRONT LINE IN THIS- LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS. YES THANK YOU. MY NAME IS KEVIN THANK YOU MANAGER MEMBERS MY NAME IS CASSIDY BURKE I AM THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE HOPE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE PHYSICIAN HEALTH OFFICERS IN CALIFORNIA SIXTY ONE COUNTY AND CITY JURISDICTIONS. I TESTIFIED BEFORE YOU AT THIS HEARING LAST YEAR RECITING A LIST OF NEEDS OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS IN THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THANK YOU FOR HEARING THAT I REVIEWED MY TESTIMONY EARLIER THIS WEEK AND WAS PLEASED TO NOTE THAT MOST OF THE ITEMS YOU PRESENTED WERE INDEED ADDRESSED THAT SHOWS THE STRONG RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. THANK YOU FOR BEING RESPONSIVE TO OUR NEEDS BUT AS YOU KNOW NEEDS CHANGE AS TIMES CHANGE AND OUR GREATEST NEED AS WE WILL DISCUSS LATER IS ONGOING INVESTMENT. THE FIRST QUESTION WERE ASKED TO ADDRESS HERE AT THIS HEARING IS HOW DO WE COORDINATE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND OTHER STATE ENTITIES. THE ANSWER IS WE HAVE A CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PH BETWEEN FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY AND JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THE FRST. TWELVE MONTHS OF THE PANDEMIC LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT DIRECTORS AS A GROUP SPENT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY HOURS ON THE PHONE C. P. H. WE HAVE REGULAR WEEKLY CHECK INS WITH THEIR LEADERSHIP. AND MULTIPLE TIMES A WEEK CDPH HOST OFFICE HOURS FOCUSED ON SPECIFIC TOPICS SUCH AS VACCINE ADMINISTRATION TESTING SITES OR MODELING. TWENTY MERGING THESE ARISE WE HAVE LATE NIGHT AND WEEKEND PHONE CALLS AS WELL. WE ALSO WHEN NECESSARY CAN SPEAK WITH THE HHS SECRETARY GOVE OPS AND THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE. THINGS DO MOVE QUICKLY AS THE CHAIR POINTED OUT WE KNOW THE STATE NEVER WANTS TO SURPRISE US AND DOES THEIR BEST TO NOTIFY LOCAL HEALTH LEADERS IN ADVANCE OF MAJOR NOW. NOT ALWAYS PERFECT BUT THE RELATIONSHIP IS GOOD. MY COLLEAGUE MICHELLE GIVENS WILL DELVE MORE DEEPLY INTO OUR RESOURCE NEEDS I WILL SIMPLY GIVE A BRIEF INTRODUCTION. WE NEED BETTER INSIGHT INTO DATA AND BETTER DATA SYSTEMS AT THE STATE LEVEL WE ALSO NEED THE STATE TO WORK WITH US TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY DATA ON DEMOGRAPHICS AND BAXEEN INVENTORY IS CORRECT BEFORE IT IS PUBLISHED. WE NEED MORE VACCINE. THE STATE IS NOT IN CONTROL OF THAT IT'S A FEDERAL ISSUE BUT I MENTION IT BECAUSE% IT IS FRANKLY ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND MOST IMMEDIATE NEED. IN THE LONG RUN FOR BETTER PREPAREDNESS WE NEED FLEXIBLE LOCAL STAFF WHO CAN WORK ON DAY TO DAY NEEDS LIKE STDS AND TUBERCULOSIS AND THEN SWITCH TO OUTBREAKS. LIKE MEASLES OR GOD FORBID ANOTHER PANDEMIC IF NECESSARY. I WILL NOW TURN IT OVER TO MY COLLEAGUE MICHELLE GIVEN. THANK YOU. AND GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS MY NAME IS MICHELLE GIBBONS AND I'M WITH THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUE CATHY BURKE SHE SPOKE ON A RELATIONSHIP SO I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE RESOURCE NEEDS OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. BUILDING ON WHAT DR ERICA PUNCH SHARED I WANT TO FIRST START BY HIGHLIGHTING THE UNDERFUNDING OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN OUR STATE WHICH MEANT THAT LOCALLY WE HAD LIMITED CONTACT TRACING AND DISEASE INVESTIGATION WORKFORCE. LIMITED EPIDEMIOLOGIST OUTDATED DATA SYSTEMS REDUCE PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY CAPACITY AND A LACK OF UPDATED EQUIPMENT AMONG OTHER DEFICIT. BECAUSE OF THIS THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO STATE OF RAMPING UP WRAPPING UP CONTACT TRACING RAMPING UP TESTING. RAMPING UP OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE AND EDUCATION TO DIFFERENT SECTORS AND NOW RAMPING UP VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. THE RAMP UP SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THIS OPENED AT NUMBER OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFF THAT WE HAD BUT IT ONLY HAPPENED WITH THE INFUSION OF FEDERAL FUNDS AND THE SUPPLEMENT OF STATE RESOURCES. IN ADDITION MANY OF THE DATA SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SET UP BY THE STATE OR THE DIRECT REFLECTION OF A LACK OF INVESTMENT IN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DATA SYSTEMS. THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF DOLLARS INVESTED INTO THESE SYSTEMS DURING THE PANDEMIC FOR CONTACT TRACING TESTING RESEARCH REQUEST IN AGAIN NOW BAXEEN ADMINISTRATION. INSTEAD SHOULD HAVE BEEN INVESTED EARLIER TO MAINTAIN AND MODERNIZE THOSE SYSTEMS. IS INVESTMENTS NEED TO BE SUSTAINED BEYOND THE PANDEMIC BOTH TO ADDRESS THE RESIDUAL CODE RESPONSIBILITIES AND TO ALSO BOLSTER PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. BEFORE THE NEXT PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT. LEE ADDITIONAL TO PASS IS TEN. AND THERE'S NO FUND STREAM TO SUSTAIN BEYOND THE PANDEMIC. OUR CALIFORNIA CANTLEY COALITION MADE UP OF COUNTY ASSOCIATIONS ORGANIZED LABOR AND PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES IS ASKING FOR TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND. THESE FUNDS COULD SUPPORT THE RETENTION OF STAFF TO WORK ACROSS VARIOUS CRITICAL ISSUES SUCH AS EQUITY. HOME VISITING STDS AND OTHER COMMUNICABLE DISEASE AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREATS. AND AGAIN THE DATA SYSTEMS THAT WERE STOOD UP SHOULD CONTINUE TO BRING VALUE TO OUR STATE. AND OR SIMILAR INVESTMENTS INTO MODERNIZING THE PUBLIC HEALTH DATA SYSTEM SHOULD BE MADE. LASTLY I WANT TO TURN TO YOU ADD THE VACCINE ADMINISTRATION. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ROSE TO THE CHALLENGE OF ADMINISTERING VACCINES QUICKLY AND THEY'RE DOING SO WITH EQUITY IN MINE. WE STILL HAVE LOCAL BACKS AND VACCINATION SITES PARTNER WITH PROVIDERS TO THE COMMUNITY THAT ARE CRITICAL TO THE STATE'S EQUITY GOAL. AND ALSO CONTINUE TO EXPLORE MUCH NEW STRATEGIES TO REACH VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES.WITH THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE THIRD PARTY AGREEMENT AND NOW THE REQUIREMENT FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO USE MY TURN. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WILL NEED THE FOLLOWING. INCREASE VACCINE SUPPLY THE LOCAL VACCINATION SITES CAN RAMP UP TO FULL CAPACITY. ACCURATE AND TRANSPARENT DATA WE CAN'T GUARANTEE EQUITY WITHOUT KNOWING HOW MUCH VACCINE IS BEING ALLOCATED AND ADMINISTERED BY ALL PARTNERS INCLUDING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. AND SEE EASE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDERS. AND WE APPRECIATE THAT THE STATE IS WORKING TO CLEAN UP THE DATA IN PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND PROVIDERS. BUT WE THINK THAT THERE'S MORE THAT STILL NEEDS TO BE DONE BEFORE IT ACCURATELY REFLECTS WHAT'S HAPPENING ON THE GROUND. WE ALSO NEED TRANSPARENT EQUITABLE ALLOCATIONS TO BE DONE IN COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT- THE NATIONALLY AND ONGOING. AND THEN LASTLY WE NEED- THE FUNCTIONALITY EXCUSE ME WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION OUR CURRENT PROVIDER NETWORKS THAT WERE BUILT- IT LOCALLY INTO THE THIRD PARTY NETWORK AS WELL. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE FUNCTIONALITY IN MY TURN TO FOCUS ON VULNERABLE POPULATIONS. AND ANY TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE THAT MAY ARISE OUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS PROVIDED TO US IN A TIMELY MANNER GIVEN THE NEW SYSTEM. IT'S BEEN A CHALLENGING YEAR BUT. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CONTINUE TO DO ALL THAT THEY CAN AND TO PROTECT THEIR CA. WE APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE LOOK FORWARD TO ADDRESSING ANY QUESTIONS AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- CLINICS. HEY GOOD MORNING SENATORS I AM ANTI MARTINEZ PATTERSON THE VICE PRSIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS FOR THE CALIFORNIA PRIMARY CARE ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC AND ITS IMPACT ON COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. CBSA REPRESENTS FOURTEEN HUNDRED COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS. PROVIDE PRIMARY BEHAVIORAL AND ORAL HEALTH CARE TO SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION CALIFORNIANS THAT'S APPROXIMATELY ONE IN FIVE I'M TO GIVE YOU A BETTER SENSE OF OUR PATIENT POPULATION OF ONE IN THREE OF THE ALL MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES RECEIVE CARE AT COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTER. THREE FORCE OF OUR PATIENT POPULATION ARE PEOPLE OF COLOR AND THE MAJORITY ARE UNDER 2100% OF FEDERAL POVERTY- SO NEEDLESS TO SAY COVER NINETEEN HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED OUR PATIENT POPULATION. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC LIKE MOST PROVIDERS COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS EXPERIENCED MASSIVE DROPS IN VISITS. BECAUSE WE ARE DENTAL PROVIDERS WE HAD TO SEE THE CLOSED TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF OUR DENTAL SITES. WHICH ARE NOW RAMPING BACK UP WE HAD TO FURLOUGH STAFF TEMPORARILY CLOSED SITES AND WE'VE HAD AN OVERALL CONSTRUCTION OF STAFF BECAUSE THEY AYE AYE THERE ARE BEING INFECTED BY CO THAT THEY HAD TO QUARANTINE FROM. EXPOSURE TO COVET AND WE ALSO HAD TO DEAL WITH CHILDREN AT HOME FROM THE SHELTER IN PLACE ORDERS. IN REGARDS TO CASTING TREATMENT AS WELL AS VACCINES. THE WITH TESTING CENTERS. ARE TESTING BUT NOT NEARLY IN THE LARGE TESTING EFFORTS THAT WE HAD ORIGINALLY ENVISIONED- SOME DID AT THE BEGINNING BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF RESOURCES AND STAFF AND WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT STATEWIDE. THE HEALTH CENTERS THAT ARE DOING NOT LARGE TOPPING EFFORTS TEND TO BE THOSE PARTNERING WITH HEIR COUNTIES AND ARE RECEIVING SUPPORT FROM THE COUNTY PARTNERSHIPS. ONE OF FLAG THAT FIVE HEALTH CENTERS ARE PROVIDING MONOCLONAL ANTIBODY AND FUSION THERAPY AND MANY MORE ARE PREPARING TO DO SO. THIS THERE APPEARS FOR ACUTELY COVERT POSITIVE PATIENTS. I MEAN IT'S NOT APPROPRIATE ON TO BE VACCINATING THEM AT THIS POINT BUT IT HELPS PREVENT HOSPITALIZATIONS IN A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL. UP AS TO VACCINES WE ARE HOPING THE VACCINES ARE VERY DIFFERENT STORY THAN TESTING. OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT HEALTH CENTER SHOULD BE VACCINATING ALL OF THEIR PATIENTS AT SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION PEOPLE OF COLOR LOW INCOME PEOPLE OF COLOR ACROSS CALIFORNIA. TO DATE HOWEVER WE HAVE. DONE THOUSANDS- BUT WE HAVEN'T HAD ENOUGH VACCINE IN ORDER TO DO AS MUH AS WE NEED TO. I'M AS DR PINE NOTED THE BITE IN HERE SAID MINISTRATION HAS ACKNOWLEDGED THE PIVOTAL IN CRITICAL ROLE OF FQHCS. AND IT'S STARTING TO DISTRIBUTE VACCINES AS NOTED TO FIVE NEXT WEEK AND WE'RE HOPING TO SEE ALL OF OUR HEALTH CENTERS WITHIN THE NEXT MONTH OR TO. HAVE ACCESS TO DIRECTION MEANT FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THE PLAN IS TO GET A MILLION VACCINES AFTER WHICH IS A WEEK WITH THE GOAL OF ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS DOSES NATIONWIDE BUT ONE WITH KNOWLEDGE. OUR PATIENT POPULATION AND SEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION SO WE'RE GONNA NEED UPWARDS OF AROUND FOURTEEN MILLION DOSES JUST IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. AND WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AS IT NOTES A 100% F. MAP FOR MEDICAID VACCINE ADMINISTRATION WHICH WE REALLY HOPE DHS TAKES FULL ADVANTAGE UP. TO ACCURATE SEES CAN RECEIVE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DO. LARGER VACCINE EFFORTS AND QUICKER VACCINE EFFORTS. WE ARE IN OUR- IN RELATION TO VACCINE DISTRIBUTION WE ARE IN CONVERSATION WITH BLUE SHIELD THE T. PA- BUT WE HAVE YET TO DETERMINE THE EXACT ROLE FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS IN CALIFORNIA. IN REGARDS TO HOW THE PANDEMIC HAS IMPACTED PRIMARY CARE I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT AN UNDERSCORE TELEHEALTH- I CAN'T SAY THIS WITHOUT FIRST COMMENDING AND THANKING DH CS ONCE AGAIN SPECIFICALLY J. C. COOPER. WHO HELPED US IMMEDIATELY RECEIVE THE FLEXIBILITY AND THE RESOURCES TO PROVIDE BOTH TELEHEALTH. TELEPHONIC AND VIRTUAL CARE- WHICH WAS INSTRUMENTAL TO KEEPING THE HEALTH CENTERS STRONG AND FEELING DURING THE- BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC. AT THE BEGINNING HEALTH CENTER FOR PROVIDING ABOUT 80% OF VISITS TELEPHONICALLY- AND NOW IT'S ABOUT 50% QUITE SIMPLY PATIENTS LOVE IT PROVIDERS LOVE IT- AND WE NEED TO ENSURE. THAT E ARE PAYING FOR PARITY THE TELEPHONIC AND TELE TELE- VIRTUAL CARE ALL ARE BOTH BEING PAID THE SAME- SO THAT WE DON'T CREATE A TWO TIERED SYSTEM FOR CALIFORNIANS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. HELLO I'M HOPING YOU CAN ALL HEAR ME WE CAN. WONDERFUL HELLO MY NAME IS IAN WALTERS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF CLINICAL AFFAIRS AND QUALITY IMPROVEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES AND WE'RE A TRADE ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTED THEIR TEAM HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND INTERMEDIATE CARE- DEVELOPING ABOUT DEVELOPMENT THE FABLED CENTERS ACROSS CALIFORNIA. SO HOW WE HEARD MANY OF THE SAME- CONCERNS AND ISSUES AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WAS DESCRIBED WITH FROM BEING ON CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ARE MANY CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACING THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES I WE DIDN'T SEE ANY- A DELAY AND- PREPARATION TO IF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY TO THE RESPONSE OF SO MUCH ATTENTION WAS PUT TOWARD THE HOSPITAL IN ORDER TO PREPARE THEM FOR- YOU KNOW THE SURGE THAT WAS EXPECTED TO OCCUR- YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN A REGULAR QUESTION WAS YOU KNOW HOW WE'RE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AFFECTED AND- AND HONESTLY THE- THE X. FACTOR BAND. THE COMPLETE CHANGES ALL OF OPERATIONS WITHIN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY OF FROM THE- BAN ON VISITORS TO THE REQUIREMENT FOR EXTENSIVE PP THAT HAS NEVER BEEN REQUIRED BEFORE INFILL NURSING. AND ALSO IN JUST THREE WEEKS STAFF AND THE WAY WE PREPARE AND PROVIDE CARE FOR ALL OF OUR OUR FACILITY RATHER THAN. SO IT IS REALLY JUST- CHANGE EVERYTHING THAT WE USUALLY DO AND TRYING TO PROVIDE A HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT FOR OUR RESIDENTS I'M SO IT'S BEEN TRULY A COMPLETE TURNAROUND FOR I'M OUR RESIDENTS AND OUR STAFF. AND YOU KNOW THAT ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WAS HOW HAVE WE PROTECT IT RESIDENTS STAFF AND OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW EVERYBODY KNOWS THE BEGINNING A PANDEMIC WITH SUCH A LACK OF PVD AND ALSO YOU KNOW NOT MUCH UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE VIRUS IS. AIRBORNE AND AFFECTS PEOPLE AND SO IF THE BEGINNING THINGS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PROVIDE PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT TO ALL STAFF NEEDED IT. THANK GOODNESS THAT THOSE- LINES OUR RESOURCES WERE. INCREASED AND ADDS AND WE YOU REACH THE SURGE OVER THE SUMMER WE GOT HAD MORE AT. TO PP BAG EVEN WE SEE HAVE A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS. THAT ARE USING. USE OF THEIR PP BECAUSE THERE ISN'T AND- TO RETURN A FEW ORMAL. OF THE STILL STRUGGLE IN. A HIGH ENOUGH OF. AN OBVIOUS THE FINANCING IS GOING A LONG WAY TRYING USE THE THOSE AMOUNTS PLAN. I'M NOT ONLY KEEPING YOU SAID THINK SOME BY THE ACTUAL OF THE PD ISN'T THE HIGH FOLD. AND SO THAT HAS CREATED QUITE THE CHIU. I'M VERY THOUGH THE PART OF PROTECTING AND READ IS THAT ON MOST OUR- PARK. AND HE ARE FEDERAL PARTNERSHIP TO BRING A VACCINE YOU NURSING HOMES AND I'M SO GREAT NUMBERS OUT THERE- ALL OF THE FACILITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA HAS THEN HAD THEIR FIRST VISIT- FIRE. A FEW YEARS OR WALGREENS I'M L. A. COUNTY IS SEPARATE AND I WENT A DIFFERENT ROUTE- BUT- 95% OF THE SLAVES OF ALREADY RECEIVED THEIR- SECOND VISIT BY HE ASKED AND WE'RE ABOUT 61% AND SECOND THERE'S IT'S BY WALGREENS SO. AT THIS POINT TIME A HUGE NUMBER OF OUR RESIDENTS HAVE BOTH OF THE VACCINATIONS ARE COMPLETE AND SO WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THAT. IT'S REALLY REFLECTING ON THE NUMBER OF I'M CURRENT CASES- YOU KNOW I JUST. HORRENDOUSLY YOU KNOW ARE AT THE HIGH STREET OVER THE HOLIDAYS YOU KNOW WE WERE SEEING SOME SEVEN HUNDRED PIECES AND THEY- ARE NOW WHERE AN AVERAGE OF SEVEN DAYS ABOUT I THINK ITSELF SEVENTY ONE. AND SO WE'VE REALLY SEEN SOME REMARKABLE CHANGES ON THANK GOODNESS THE COMMUNITY SEARCHES DECREASED THAT ALONG WITH THE VACCINATION PROGRAM HAS REALLY MADE A HUGE IMPACT. OUR FOR OUR RESIDENTS. AS WELL AS FAR STAFF. AND THE AND THAT WAS PART OF THE OTHER QUESTIONS BACKING. PROGRESS WE'RE WE'RE CONTINUING WITH FOR YOU KNOW. I'M A GOOD DOWN AS WELL- OVER THAT. 5% OF THE BILL IN L. A. COUNTY- SO THEY'RE NOT IN THE- HAS ALSO. COMPLETED THEIR FIRST ROUND BACK. AND OUR SO WE CAN TO MOVE FOR WITH- AS WE PREPARE FOR THAT. DAYS THAT. I CAN TO BE. THAT ARE STAFF FAX NATION'S WELL. SO AT THIS POINT TIME I BELIEVE THAT YOU WE'RE SEEING OVER A PERCENT. OF OUR RESIDENTS THAT ARE ACCEPTING THE VACCINE SO THAT HAS BEEN EIGHTY WONDERFUL ON RESPONSE ON THE FACILITIES I WORK DILIGENTLY TO GET. FROM CONSENT FROM FAMILY AND OTHER PERSONS FOR THOSE RESIDENTS SAID I CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES SO. THEY HAVE HOW THOSE IN PLACE IN OUR SEEN ON THAT HUGE NUMBER. AND SO- THINGS CONTINUE MOVE FORWARD AND WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO. SEE THAT COMMUNITIES CONTINUE DROP AND THEREFORE BEING ABLE TO AGAIN BRING BACK OUR FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN VISIT OUR RESIDENTS AND A MUCH MORE PERSONAL WAY IS AND WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROVIDE RIGHT NOW. HELLO AS FOR THINGS FOR OUR SKILLED NURSING- SECTOR WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AND TO. PUT FORWARD OUT FOR YOU TO CONSIDER ENDING A FULLY FUNDING OF YOU KNOW OUR COSTS OF LABOR OUTSIDE THAT THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT PROGRAM IN ORDER FOR US TO REALLY BRING THOSE WE JUST DO OUR WORK BIRTH. I'M AT THE FOREFRONT INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW TWO YEARS IN ARREARS SO THAT'S THE ONE I THINK THAT WE'RE HOPING TO WORK WITH EVERYONE ON AND ON OBVIOUSLY THE BIG THING IS WAITING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- FROM ALL LEVELS YOU TO BRING YOUR FAMILY. BACK TO THE VISITING ON. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND THE- YES GOOD MORNING COMMITTEE MEMBER I AM SURE AND SEVEN SOMEONE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK RECEIVED PAN WHERE IS STATE WIDE MULTI CULTURAL HEALTH ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO THE BELIEF THAT BY UNITING COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND BRINGING CONSUMER VOICE TO THE TABLE WE CAN ADVANCE HEALTH EQUITY. OKAY NINETEEN IS A CRISIS WITHIN A CRISIS. NO CORNER OF THE STATE HAS BEEN LEFT UNTOUCHED BUT THE IMPACT HAS BEEN FAR FROM EQUALLY DISTRIBUTED. GENERATIONS OF STRUCTURAL RACISM CREATE SYSTEMIC INEQUITIES THAT HAVE BEEN COMPOUNDED BY THE PANDEMIC. RESULTING IN DEVASTATION IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. SIMPLY PUT COBIT NINETEEN IS A PANDEMIC WITHIN THE ON GOING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THAT IS RACISM. PEOPLE OF COLOR PARTICULARLY BLACK LATINO NATIVE AMERICAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDER PEOPLE ARE LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE A USUAL SOURCE OF HEALTHCARE MOST LIKELY TO LIVE WITH CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS SUCH AS HEART DISEASE DIABETES AND ASTHMA. AND FREQUENTLY REPORT DISCRIMINATORY TREATMENT WITHIN HEALTH CARE SETTINGS. ARE THERE MORE PEOPLE OF COLOR ARE MOST LIKELY TO LIVE IN HISTORICALLY REDLINED NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH TODAY ARE PLAGUED BY ADVERSE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL TOXINS. FOOD DESERT'S AND GUN VIOLENCE. IT IS AGAINST THIS BACKDROP THAT COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND NOW INJURING THE MOST DEVASTATING IMPACT OF COBIT NINETEEN THE HIGHEST RATES OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION THE LARGEST NUMBER OF DEATHS AND THE GREATEST LOSSES OF JOBS AND- ENTIRE FAMILY. BEEN LOST TO THE VIRUS. YET WE CONTINUE TO WITNESS GRAVE INEQUITIES IN ACCESS TO PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FINANCIAL RELIEF AND THE CORPORATE NINETEEN VACCINE. WE APPLAUD THE ACTIONS THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN TO FOCUS RESOURCES ON NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED BY ADVERSE SOCIAL DETERMINANTS. THE BLUEPRINT FOR SAFER ECONOMY INCLUDE TO HEALTH EQUITY METRICS THAT INSTITUTIONALIZE IS THE PRINCIPLE THAT WE ARE ALL STRONGER OR WE ARE ALL HEALTHIER WHEN WE LEAVE NO ONE BEHIND. THE STATE HAS REQUIRED COUNTIES TO INVEST A MEASUREABLE PORTION OF THEIR COPING NINETEEN REALLY FUNDS IN THE COMMUNITIES HARDEST HIT BY THE PANDEMIC. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HOWEVER THAT THE HEALTH EQUITY METRIC IS IN PERFECT OVERLOOKING SMALL POPULATIONS THAT ARE AMONG THE MOST BURDENS SUCH AS THE PACIFIC ISLANDER COMMUNITY BECAUSE IT DOES NOT EXPLICITLY CONSIDER RACE OR LANGUAGE. AND MOST IMPORTANTLY EVEN DEDICATING A PORTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH RESOURCES FOR EQUITY IS INADEQUATE WHEN PUBLIC HEALTH IS AS MASSIVELY UNDERFUNDED AS IT IS TODAY. WE DO QUESTION THE LONG TERM IMPACT OF THE RELIANCE ON LARGE TECHNOLOGY AND HEALTH INDUSTRY COMPANIES IN THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE WHO WILL BE HERE TODAY AND GONE TOMORROW MISSING THE OPPORTUNITY TO DIRECTOR STATE RESOURCES TO BUILDING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WILL DISRUPT THE ROOT CAUSES OF INEQUITY. WE HEARD TODAY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES RELATED TO LACK OF IT INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN ORGANIZATIONS THAT EFFECTIVELY REACH OUR MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THIS IS WHERE WE SHOULD BE MAKING OUR INVESTMENTS. WE RECOMMEND FOR ACTION STEPS FOR THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO STEM THE DAMAGE OF THE PANDEMIC AND BEGAN TO BUILD A MORE EQUITABLE CALIFORNIA. FIRST DECLARE THAT RACISM IS A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS AND COMMIT RESOURCES TO IMPACT LONG. STANDING STRUCTURAL INEQUITIES. I CAN'T EXPAND WORKER PER. INCLUDING HATE SICKLY. THIRD ENSURE THAT VACCINE DISTRIBUTION REACHES THE MOST IMPACTED COMMUNITIES FIRST. AND FOURTH. REIMAGINE OUR HEALTH AND PUBLIC HEALTH CARE INFRASTRUCTURE AS TOOLS FOR COMMUNITY HEALTH AND EQUITY BY INVESTING IN COMMUNITY. I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS OR PROVIDE MORE DETAILS ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE QUESTION AND ANSWER PORTION. AND I JUST WANT TO CLOSE BY EXPRESSING OUR DEEP GRATITUDE AND SUPPORT FOR STATE AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. FOR THEIR HEROIC WORK OVER THE PAST YEAR THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET'S HEAR FROM OUR FRIENDS IN LABOR. THE MORNING MORNING. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS WILLIAM RAMIREZ AND I'M A PUBLIC HEALTH MICROBIOLOGY SUPERVISOR UNDER THE BUREAU OF MEDICAL DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION AT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND- APPROX ME TWO YEARS AGO DURING A SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING ON PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES I TESTIFIED IN THE SIMILAR APPEALS TO BARKER PASSING AND OTHER SENATE THIS IS SUPPORT OUR CORE CENTRAL PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. IN OUR WORKFORCE. AND THAT WAS ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. PASSPORTING TWO YEARS SINCE THEN AND AFTER THIS BEEN DONE BEFORE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SPEND THAT MUCH WE'RE SEEING THAT BARBARA COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE HAVE BEEN. SEVERELY RAVAGED BY THE SPEND THAT MUCH. THROUGH A MORE DEVASTATING LEVELS THAT. OTHERWISE. HAVE WE HAD A MORE ROBUST. LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH- DEPARTMENT INITIATIVE AND ALSO A REMORSE OFFICIALLY STOPPED IN RESPONSE. SO- EARLIER A DOCTOR AT THE STATE ILLUSTRATED VERY ELOQUENTLY POLICIES AND FINDING OUT THAT HAVE TO DO WITH. OUR RESPONSIVE IS THE SPEND THAT MAKE AND OTHER THINGS RELATED. BUT A LOT OF THE A LOT OF THE INFORMATION THAT WAS GIVEN TO THIS PANEL WAS WAS. AS FOR ME. THIRTY THOUSAND- AFFORDHIGH VIEW AND WHAT I'M HERE TO DO TODAY IS TO GIVE YOU GUYS SOME OF SOME EXAMPLES SOME OF AND TO SHARE MY EXPERIENCE THAT THAT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AT THE GROUND LEVEL TO ILLUSTRATE THE NEED FOR INCREASED CAPACITY AND INCREASED. SOLUTIONS ARE BETTER SERVE OUR COMMUNITY DURING THE SPEND AN EXAM OTHER- OTHER LIKE THREATS. SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I WAS ASKED TO ANSWER WAS. TO DESCRIBE THE IMPACT THAT THE- COMMON NINETEEN PANDEMIC HAS HAD ON PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS. SO I AM A SUPERVISOR MY JOB IS TO ENSURE THAT I UTILIZED THE RESPECT FORCES PROPERLY SO THAT I CAN CONDUCT WORK THAT IS RELEVANT TO KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. I HAPPEN TO BE PART OF THE UNITA SMALL UNIT WITHIN L. A. COUNTY THAT IS THAT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW CASTLE. AND WE ALSO WORK WITH- THE CDC TO TEND TO- POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS ONE SPECIFICALLY IS. THAT OF CARBAPENEM RESISTANCE. OUR SO THE RESISTANCE TO THESE OUR ANTIBIOTICS HAS TO DO WITH LAST MINUTE TYPE ANTIBIOTICS WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE OF THAT IN OUR CLIENTELE AND ACTUALLY MORE US REALLY DEVASTATED. COMMUNITIES INCLUDING LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES AND NURSING SKILLS BUILT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. WE'VE ALSO SEEN A HUGE INCREASE IN THE EMERGENCE OF CANADA OR AS WHICH IS A- AND CHECK BOND GOLD RESISTANT EAST. THIS ORGANISM HASN'T BEEN SMOKING IN THE UNITED STATES UP UNTIL. ABOUT A YEAR AND A HALF AGO WHAT WE'RE KEEPING TRACK OF IT. AND AS A RESULT OF THE REDIRECTION OF FUNDING AND RESOURCES WE'RE SEEING A HUGE FIVE SPECIAL SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA BATES OF THIS. OF THIS BEAST. OUR LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAPPENS TO BE- ONE OF THE FEW SITES THAT CAN PASS SOME CAPACITY FOR TESTING OF THE C. R. E. INTERBODY RESISTANT ORGANISMS. HOWEVER BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FINDING IT BECAUSE OF THE DIRECTION OF FINES AND STAFFING- WE HAVE ACTUALLY HAD A DOWN ON OUR TESTING TOOL ABOUT 10% WILL BE USED TO TEST ONE A COUPLE YEARS AGO AND I JUST THAT WE'VE HAD TO CUT DOWN ON OUR STAFFING AS WELL DOWN TO ONE PERSON AND THEN THAT ONE PERSON WE CAN ONLY UTILIZE FOR ABOUT HALF THE TIME. THAT'S IT THAT'S ALL YEAH AND I THINK IT'S REASONABLE TO EXPECT AND THAT BECAUSE OF THESE ACTIVITIES AND BECAUSE OF REDIRECTS ARE AND ALSO BECAUSE OF BY- LACK OF SUPPORTING THE BE ALL AGES THESE THINGS ARE GOING TO CONTINUE GETTING. MORE AND MORE DEVASTATING BUT THE MARKET NEEDS. ANOTHER QUESTION I WAS ASKED TO ASK WHERE'S OCKENFELS. AND LOCAL RESOURCES BE BETTER DIRECTED TO SUPPORT. MY WORK OUR WORK. I THINK WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN A RECORDING THANK YOU. THAT HAS TO DO WITH STAFFING. WE NEED MORE PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO DO THE WORK. WE NEED EQUIPMENT TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS FOR. AND AT THE GROUND LEVEL THE WAY THAT I WAS WITH ACTION A BABY BASIS. WITH MY COLLEAGUES. IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST HAVE STAFFING AND SUBSEQUENTLY. WE NEED A CHEST X. ROOMS STORAGE WILL NEED REFRIGERATORS AND FREEZERS THAT KIND OF STUFF. BUT I WAS SAYING WE ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND IN MY UNIT. AND DOT WE HAD SOME CAPACITY AT SOME POINT WE STILL HAVE MINIMAL CAPACITY THAT'S- WHAT. WITHIN A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH SETTING. WE CAN ADOPT NEW TECHNOLOGIES ARE VERY EASILY AND IF NOT WE CAN HAVE UR OWN HOME GROWN TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT AND EVEN SHARE WITHIN OUR- WITHIN WITH WITH OUR PARTNER. THAT'S IT OR OTHER LOCAL. ACCOUNT BUT. BUT THIS REQUIRES OBVIOUSLY TECHNICAL EXPERTISE REQUIRES SIGNED. IT REQUIRES DOCTOR REQUIRES A FUNDING FOR NEW EQUIPMENT FOR NEW TESTING TECHNOLOGIES. ONE OF THE MORE DEVASTATING THINGS CURRENTLY THAT CAN POTENTIALLY HARM AS WELL- DOWN THE LINE ALTHOUGH WE HAVE A LOT OF REALLY GOOD TEST. AND I THINK DOCTOR POUND REPORTING OF COURSE HI FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS PER DAY. RELATED TO COVER. THAT'S GREAT. HOWEVER WE NEED TO STAY ON TRACK AND ON TOP OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY CIRCULATING IN OUR COMMUNITIES. THE ONLY WAY TO DOTHAT ONE OF THE BEST WAYS TO THAT WILL BE TO CONDUCT A WHOLE GENOME SEQUENCE IS NOT THE STATE HAS A GREAT CAPACITY. WILL. BUT THEY SHOULDN'T BE ALONE IN THIS EFFORT. AT THE LOCAL PUBLIC OUT THE RECORD WE HAVE SOME CAPABILITIES THAT WILL COME AND GO. HOWEVER THE WAY WE'RE DOING IT. WE'RE DOING IT- HOW TO BEHIND THE SCENES THAT TIME. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FUNDING FOR THE- CONSOLE UNFORTUNATELY THE PERSON WHO'S CONDUCTING SOME OF THE ANALYSIS OF THIS DATA S. NEW FROM HOME. WITH THEIR HOME EQUIPMENT. IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OTHER PEOPLE THAN THE NEW YORK FROM SOME OF THE LAST ELSEWHERE. WELL THAT'S THROUGH DEDICATION. BUT I DON'T THINK IT'S ENOUGH TO HAVE A PROPER RESPONSE TO THESE THINGS AND NOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS WILL BE TO KEEP TRACK OF THE PARENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE. IN ALSO SO WE CAN UNDERSTAND. WHAT IS CIRCULATING OUT THERE. BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW LED ME THERE ARE A COUPLE OF CASES FOUND. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. OF THE SOUTH AFRICAN RAND THE PUBLIC. WHICH CAN EVENTUALLY EVEN WITH A SMALL TWEAK. RENDER THE ENTIRE BAG SLUNG OVER THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BACKS IT'LL DISTRIBUTION USED. NOW THAT'S A REALITY. SO BEST OF THE BEST MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH- BOB. WHAT THE SERVICE CAN BE PUT TO PROPER STAFFING REQUIREMENTS AND PROPER- RETENTION OF THE STOCK. WARS WITH- JIM STEVENSON REQUIRES A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF COMPUTING POWER WHICH FALLS REQUIRES I TEASE. ANOTHER QUESTION I WAS ASKED TO ANSWER WAS THAT WHAT IS THE MOST CRITICAL WHAT IS ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL INVESTMENTS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE PANDEMIC PREPARE FOR FUTURE. PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES. I HAVE TO JUST REITERATE STAFFING. THE RIGHTS THAT. FOR MORE SO BECAUSE WE HAVE SPAWNING BAD WITHIN OUR PROGRAMS WE DO GET SOME FEDERAL FUNDS AT TIMES AND THEN PASSED AS A MATTER OF FACT THE PROGRAM S MAINLY FUNDED THROUGH FEDERAL FUNDS ARE THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RIGIDITY. ASSOCIATED WITH. BUT EVEN THOUGH WE MAY HAVE SOME MONEY ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. WE CAN USE IT FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THIS SPECIFIC ORGANISM FOR THAT SPECIFIC PROGRAM. SO WE CANNOT REDIRECT ANY OF THAT MONEY TO ANY OTHER EFFORTS WE CAN RESPOND TO THAT THANKS BYE. ONE OF THE CURRENT OUTBREAKS OF STDS IN IN OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING. WITHIN OUR- POPULATION OF PEOPLE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. THE BEST WE CAN BETTER- JOHN TO STV'S ACCORDING TO BODY RESISTANT GONORRHEA CHLAMYDIA HIV NEEDS SICKENING IN THE CURRENT- ON OUTBREAKS OF TYPHUS SKATES. I WANT THANK YOU GUYS FOR YOUR TIME AND I WANT TO CLOSE BY SAYING THAT. OUR STATE CANNOT WAIT. UNTIL THE NEXT. PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS IT'S- INSTEAD WE ARE. WE HAVE THE BEST CELL OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OUR WORKFORCE SO FOR THESE REASONS AT THE VERY LEAST WE'RE ASKING FORCED ONGOING STATE SUPPORT IN FINDING OUR POOR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE IN AUGUST ALSO EXPANDING OUR WORK. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT DOES SO CERTAINLY A CONSISTENT THEME- THROUGHOUT ALL THE PRESENTATIONS WAS THE NEED FOR MORE FLEXIBILITY AND MORE RESOURCES- AND I CERTAINLY HEAR YOU AND I KNOW DOCTOR PANDITS HE IS LOOKING HAS LONG BEEN. AN ADVOCATE FOR MORE RESOURCES- IF I CAN JUST ASK A FEW QUESTIONS IN MIND I KNOW DR PANDA'S IS READY TO GO. IT IN IN IN IN DISTRIBUTING IT THROUGH THE CLINICS ARE YOU FINDING VACCINE HESITANCY IN THE END IN YOUR DEMOGRAPHIC THAT YOU'RE WORKING WITH. BUT DEFINITELY FINDING VACCINE HESITANCY- THAT WAS THE FOCUS THE BOLUS OF OUR CONVERSATIONS FOCUS ON THAT IN THE FALL- BUT I WILL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT. WITH THE DEARTH OF VACCINES RIGHT NOW IT'S ALL ABOUT TRYING TO GET MORE OF THEM SO THERE'S A HIGHER DEMAND AT THIS POINT BUT WE WERE SEEING FOR HEALTH CENTERS THAT FIRST STARTED TO DO VACCINE EFFORTS. THAT THE- THE NO SHOW RATE WAS AROUND A THIRD SOME OF THE HEALTH CENTERS ON WHICH WE THOUGHT WAS PROBABLY RELATED TO THE VACCINE HESITANCY- DEFINITELY- WE ALSO VACCINE HESITANCY AMONG OUR PROVIDERS. SO THAT WAS- THAT'S ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'RE TRYING TO COMBAT NOW WITH MORE CONVERSATION MORE EDUCATION BECAUSE OUR PROVIDERS ARE- FEELING WARY AND THEN THEY DIDN'T WANT TO THEN CONVINCE THEIR OWN PATIENTS IF THEY WERE WARY TO TAKE THE VACCINES OR WORKING ON THAT- SO THAT WE- ALL FEEL CONFIDENT IN DOING SO IT'S DEFINITELY AN ISSUE- RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT THE CENTRAL NEXUS OF OUR CONVERSATION BUT WE KNOW AS WE GET FURTHER AND WE GET MORE AND MORE VACCINES. THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A HARDER AND HARDER TIME GETTING TO. THE MOST VULNERABLE SO WE ARE WORKING ON IT DAILY IN VARIOUS DIFFERENT STRATEGIES. AND ENTER TO ALL OF YOU HOW ABOUT THE VACCINE HESITANCY WITHIN YOUR YOUR WORKFORCE. LET'S START WITH THE HELP OFFICERS. JUST JUST LIKE OUR PARTNERS AT THE CLINIC SAID WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A VACCINE HESITANCY WITHIN VARIOUS WORK FORCES WITHIN VARIOUS COMMUNITIES- BUT AT THIS POINT WE ARE SO FOCUSED ON ADMINISTRATION- WE DON'T WANT TO LEAVE THOSE COMMUNITIES BEHIND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE OF THAT. OUR TRUSTED PROVIDERS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WHICH INCLUDES THE CLINICS INCLUDES AND COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS MAINTAIN THE WORK THAT THE VALUABLE WORK THAT THEY'RE DOING TO COMMUNICATE ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE AND THE SAFETY OF YOUTH. OKAY HOSPITALS. WE SAW OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE HOSPITALS WE SAW INITIAL WORK FORCE HASN'T SEEN UNTIL THE SECOND DOES HAVE BEEN ADMINISTERED- I THINK WE WERE SENT ABOUT 30% HASN'T SEEN I THINK THAT'S DROPPED NOW QUITE SIGNIFICANTLY AS WE GET TO THAT SECOND DOSE- I DON'T KNOW HOW DO WE HAVE UPDATED FIGURES BUT IT'S STILL AN ISSUE THAT WE NEED TO WORK ON. OKAY AND THEN. THE TO THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS. IT AND ALL OF YOU IT SOUNDS LIKE THIS LIKE THE ADMINISTRATION IS THAT EMERGENCY MONEY WITHOUT A LOT OF STRINGS ATTACHED. YOU'RE ASKING FOR MORE RESOURCES THAT YOU CAN THAT YOU CAN SPECIFICALLY TARGET. IN YOUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES AND OF THE SON YOU GAVE US TWO HUNDRED MILLION WAS THE ASK. YES AND MICHELLE GIVENS GI I'M HAPPY TO TAKE THAT QUESTION SO THAT IS TO NOT JUST HAVE KIND OF THE RESPONSE- RESOURCES FOR RESPONSE. I THINK EVERYBODY YOU KNOW BARELY SELL ARE REALLY FOCUSED ON THE PANDEMIC AND WHAT'S IN FRONT OF US BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHAT LED US TO THIS POINT. AND ALL OF THE CONTINUE IS RAMPING UP IS THAT BECAUSE WE LACK THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE NEEDED. SO THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND THAT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS REALLY TO HELP REINVESTMENT OF THAT PUBLIC HEALTH WORKFORCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE PUBLIC TO GET IN BAD STAFF THAT CAN WORK ACROSS DIFFERENT PROGRAMS- THAT EPIDEMIOLOGISTS COMMUNICABLE DISEASE STAFF. MET MET I THINK ANOTHER REAL POSSIBILITY IS THAT WE'VE EXPANDED OUR STAFF TO BE MUCH LARGER THAN IT WAS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS KIND OF DOUBLING THE SIZE OF THEIR DEPARTMENTS OR EVEN MORE. AND IT WOULD BE A SHAME THAT AFTER THOSE FUNDS THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE ARE GONE FOR US TO LOSE THOSE FOLKS THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH US FOR THAT PAST YEAR. SO WOULD REALLY BE A WAY THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO BUILD AND REBUILD OUR PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WHILE ALSO LEVERAGING- THE STAFF THAT HAVE COME OUR WAY. DURING THIS PANDEMIC. THANK YOU THIRTY PM. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR A FIRST OF ALL I DO WANT TO THANK OUR PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS AND- APPRECIATE PRESENTATION FROM- SILVA FROM SEIU BUT ALSO OUR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS WHO NOT ONLY OF COURSE HAVE BEEN WORKING AROUND THE CLOCK TO TRY TO STOP THIS PANDEMIC BUT UNFORTUNATELY LOS HAVE BEEN TARGETED BY SOME PEOPLE AND WE'VE SEEN ATTACKS ON OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND WORKERS AND SO FORTH. AND DO WANTED JUST RECOGNIZE THAT AND WE SEEN FORTUNATELY SEVERAL OF THEM AND UP RESIGNING OR RETIRING OR LEAVING BECAUSE OF THAT AND- AND- CERTAINLY THAT HAS NOT HELPED- RESPONSE WINDOW YOU HAVE PEOPLE WHO- ENGAGING THREATS AND VIOLENCE AND- GOING TO PEOPLE'S HOMES AND- SO FORTH. AND SO I GOT IT BY RECOGNIZE THE COURAGE AND- OF OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS TO CONTINUE DO THE WORK- I KNOW THAT SOME OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS WE TALKED I CONTACT TRACY. SOMETIMES THE KIND RESPONSES THEY GET WHEN THEY TRY TO REACH OUT TO STOP THE PANDEMIC ARE. THIS VOTE LESS THAN KIND IS PROBABLY AN UNDERSTATEMENT AND- AND I HOPE THAT WE IS- THE STATE- WILL WILL WILL READ WILL RECOGNIZE AND- AND SUPPORTER PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS AND OF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AS THEY DO THEIR- WORK TO HELP PROTECT ALL OF US- I GUESS. THE AND I PRE APPRECIATE THAT YEP WE DO NEED TO BUILD THAT INFRASTRUCTURE AND AS AS AS PRESENTED- IT IN TERMS OF- SERVE OUR ON GOING RESPONSE- YOU KNOW I THINK THE- WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK I MEAN AND IN TERMS OF- LIKE IT WE GET ASKED BEFORE BUT PERHAPS FOR THIS PARTICULAR PANEL- YOU. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY COVET IS THERE THE BIG THING IN FRONT OF US BUT I ALSO WOULD POINT OUT THAT AS THEY DID IN THE PREVIOUS HEARING THAT. THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE AN OUTBREAK OF SOMETHING GOING ON EVERY YEAR IS NOT MORE THAN ONE THING. AND SO THIS SHOULD IS- IT MAYBE NOT THE SCALE OF CERTAINLY NOT THE SKILL OF CODE WHICH IS FIVE ONE DEL SERVE THEM ONCE IN A CENTURY KIND OF THING WE HOPE IT STAYS ONCE IN A CENTURY- BUT- BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT EVEN WE HAD SMALLER OUTBREAKS LIKE IN TWENTY NINETEEN WE HAD A- LOT OF MEASLES. IT SEEMS LIKE FOREVER BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT STAFF GOT PULLED AWAY FROM DOING ON GOING PUBLIC HEALTH WORK TO CONFRONT MEASLES OUTBREAKS WE HAD HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND- SO THIS SEEMS TO BE A REPETITIVE CYCLE. HE RECENTLY GET UP PERHAPS- LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND- AND ALSO PARTICULARLY- ARE AT- REPRESENT FROM S. YEAH YOU CAN SPEAK TO- YOU KNOW SIR THAT.WHAT HAPPENS EVERY TIME WE HAVE AN OUTBREAK NOT JUST COVERT EVEN OTHER ONES AND IN TERMS OF BEING ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE ON GOING WORK THINGS LIKE CHRONIC DISEASE ARE. NOW WE TRY TO DEAL WITH ENVIRONMENTAL HAZARDS AND TOXINS AND SO FORTH IT'S ERA. AND AND THE NEED TO BE SURELY- SUSTAIN THOSE AND OF COURSE ALSO FROM- HEALTH DEPARTMENT FOLKS SELF. CAN YOU CAN YOU PERHAPS SPEAK TO THAT. WHAT'S HAPPENING THERE. HI THIS IS MICHELLE AGAIN I'M HAPPY TO START YES IT'S REASONABLE THAT- AND BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC AND THE LACK OF RESOURCES AND INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE HAD THAT MANY OF OUR STAFF WERE REDIRECTED TO REALLY FOCUS ON COLVIN AND I'VE HEARD THIS REFERENCE MORE THAN ONCE FROM OUR HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ABOUT HOW WE'VE REALLY FORMED CULVER DEPARTMENTS OVER THIS PAST YEAR AND THAT THERE ARE OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT THEY'RE STRIVING TO CONTINUE TO DO BUT OURS- POTENTIALLY SUFFERING A LITTLE BIT DURING THE PANDEMIC AND I'LL GIVE YOU EXAMPLES OF WHY. IN SOME JURISDICTIONS THEY ONLY HAD MAYBE ONE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSE THAT MAYBE WORK ON HOME VISITING ORDER ADD INTEREST IN PROGRAMS AT SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND THAT ONE PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES VITAL TO THE BARE SPOTS IN THE PANDEMIC AND SO THEY THEY'VE HAD TO BE RE DIRECTED UP PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC I KNOW STD RATES WAS CONTINUING TO BE A CHALLENGE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND EVEN THEN OUT WE DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH CAMILLE DISEASE INVESTIGATORS AND CONTACT TRACERS TO REALLY REACH EVERYONE. AND SO WHAT THEY WERE HAVING TO DO IS PRIORITIZE BY DISEASE BURDEN AND THAT AND IN TERMS OF INVESTIGATING AND GOING FORWARD THE NOW THOSE SAME INDIVIDUALS WHO MAY HAVE BEEN WORKING ON STDS ARE NOW BEING RE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE PANDEMIC AS WELL AND I THINK THERE'S A HOST OF A NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES WHERE WE ARE HAVING TO PULL OUR STAFF AND RE DIRECT THEM TOWARDS THE FOCUS OF THE PANDEMIC AND TO THE EXTENT AND THE ONE THING I WOULD JUST SAY IS THAT. IN IN OUR DEPARTMENTS THERE IS ALSO A LEVEL OF CATEGORICAL FUNDING WHICH I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE SPEAKER FROM S. YEAH YOU STATE AND SO THERE ARE LIMITATIONS TO HOW WE CAN MOVE OUR STAFF AROUND AS WELL AND SO I THINK HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD TO MADE IT IS DO YOU DO YOU LOSE THE FUNDING AND THE FEDERAL SOURCE OF FUNDING BECAUSE YOU HAVE TO RE DIRECT THE PERSON OR DO YOU TRY TO MAINTAIN THAT PERSON AND THEN ARE YOU AND- KIND OF LOSING. A RESOURCE THAT CAN BE RE DIRECTED TOWARDS THE PANDEMIC SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE TOUGH DECISIONS. THAT OUR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE HAD TO FACE. MISTER MAYOR. YES HELLO SOME TRICKY THIS YEAR YES WE CAN OKAY SO I WAS DOWN AT THE LABORATORY AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS PART OF THE PART OF A TEAM THAT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A TESTING FR MEASLES DURING THE MARKET AS WELL AS THE- THAT OUTBREAK WE HAD IN THAT THEME PARK. IN THE IN ORANGE COUNTY. ALSO DURING DURING DURING THAT TIME. UNFORTUNATELY WE HAD TO BE SENDING MOST OF OUR TESTING ACTUALLY ALL OF OUR TESTING TO THE STATE LABORATORY WHICH IS GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE- PARTNERS. HOWEVER WE NEED TO HAVE SOME CAPACITIES AT A LOCAL LEVEL AS WELL. SO AT THE TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE THAT WOULD USE THAT KNOWLEDGE IS THAT EXPECT EXISTS IN OUR LABORATORY. EVENTUALLY WITH TIME AND EFFORT WE WERE ABLE TO BRING ON- IS YOUR TESTS FOR THE DETECTION OF MIDDLE SCHOOL NOW WE HAVE THAT RIGHT TO GET REAL. BUT I THINK MORE IMPORTANTLY ONE THAT I WANTED. ILLUSTRATE IN TERMS OF STAFFING IS THAT. PART OF OUR LAB IN THE STATE IN COLLABORATION WITH THE UCLA. SCHOOL OF MY OF. HEALTH WHERE WE UTILIZED A STATISTICAL MODEL TO. TO KINDA ILLUSTRATING CHAU- HOW THIS. HOW THE RAPIDLY- DOESN'T NEED. I WOULD BE. PASSED WIDESPREAD AND SEEN. BIG CLOSE THE WITH OBSERVABLE DATA SO WE SAW THAT A LOT OF THE WE ALSO SPOKE ACCOUNT WHAT THE ACTUAL CALL OF WITH ANY TO BE SPENT THEM. AND SO WE HAVE SOME ROUGH- AND BY THE WAY THIS THIS THIS. THIS STUDY- WE CAN STAY- A COP OF THIS TO THE- YES- REGIS BUT WE HAVE BEEN WE CAN SAY THAT OVER TO YOU. SURE ARE WE SAW THAT- AT THE END OF THE- THE RESPONSE OF THE AND THEN I OR TO THE TO THIS BRAND OF MEASLES ARE WE ENDED UP SPENDING AS- OUR FROM SOME FROM TWO THREE TO THREE FOUR EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THIS TO TWENTY THIS WALL. THAT'S WHAT WE DO ON A DAILY BASIS. BUT WOULD LIKE A LACK OF FUNDING LACK OF STAFFING ARE WE CHAT WILL BE DO OUR JOBS WERE SCENES BACK IN A FEW RESPECT A SENSE OF YOU COMING TO WORK READY TO WORK WE HAVE WELL AT LEAST FIND. ANTI BEHIND OUR BACKS. UNFORTUNATELY THE PERSON THAT WAS WITH STATE IS LONGER. WORKING FOR THE- OF PUBLIC HEALTH THEY MOVED ON TO- OTHER THINGS ACTUALLY WORKING ON THE A CAR. SO WE NEED TO ABLE TO A MAKE TO TOLD THE SKY OF EXPERTISE WITHIN OF HEALTH. AND SO THIS IS ANOTHER REASON WHY WE ARE. FOR THIS ONGOING SUPPORT. WHAT IMPORTANCE. THAT THAT SHOULD BE TO THE OUR RICH NOT JUST TO JUST WALK IN THE BUT EVERY ONE OF THESE THINGS ARE WATCHING ON A REGULAR BASIS. HOW HOW HAS THE HOW HAS THE PANDEMIC. IMPACTED YOUR BUDGET. AS IT RELATES TO STAFFING. I KNOW I KNOW STAFF HAS BEEN A LOT OF OVERTIME STRESSED OUT NOT HAVING AND ANOTHER STAFF WHICH IS WHAT I KEEP HEARING. SO I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE TO BRING IN TRAVELERS AND I'M ASSUMING YOU HAVE TO. PAY A LOT OF OVERTIME HOW HAS THAT IMPACTED YOUR BUDGETS AND YOUR ABILITY TO DELIVER CARE. VERY SOON AGAIN I THINK FROM THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT STANDPOINT- THEIR HUSBAND INFUSION OF FEDERAL DOLLARS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH DIFFERENT- WHAT THEY CALL ENHANCE LABORATORY CAPACITY FUNDING. AND SO THAT IS ALLOWED US TO KIND OF RAMP UP SLOWLY- ON DIFFERENT LEVELS. AND SO I WILL SAY THOUGH THAT THOSE FUNDS EXPIRE THEY'RE NOT YOU KNOW A CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION AND WHAT HAPPENS IS TYPICALLY THERE IS. A DISEASE AND THEN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STEPS IN AND PROVIDES SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDING SO WE SAW THIS WITH EBOLA WE SAW THIS WITH ZECA. WE'RE SEEING THAT I THINK THERE'S A TON OF OTHER EXAMPLES THAT ARE COMING TO MIND BUT THAT'S HOW WE'RE SEEING IT WITH THE PANDEMIC TO. AND SO YES THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO ADD TO THEIR STAFF AND I THINK IT HELPS TO OFFSET SOME OF THE ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT STAFF BRING HER IN WITH OVERTIME AND- THINGS LIKE THAT. BUT THERE IS NO SOURCES TO CONTINUE THEM AND SO- THE MOST RECENT FEDERAL DOLLARS WE HAD JUST ASKED FOR ONE POINT TWO BILLION FOR CONTACT TRACING- DISEASE INVESTIGATION VACCINES AND TESTING. SOME OF THOSE BECAUSE- FUNDS WOULD BE USED TOWARDS STAFFING COSTS AND SOME WILL BE USED FOR EQUIPMENT AND OTHER. NEED SECURITY AT A VACCINE SITE FOR EXAMPLE AND WE REALLY APPRECIATE THAT THAT AND THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE APPROVED THOSE FUNDS IN THE PLAN THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAD. TO PROVIDE US WITH THAT ONE POINT TWO BILLION BUT I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THAT'S ONLY FOR THE NEXT SIX MONTHS WORTH OF. AND COST ESTIMATES ON THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT SIDE AND AS WE CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THE DURATION OF A PANDEMIC ADDITIONAL AS YOU KNOW RESOURCES MAY BE NEEDED. THAT'S WHERE USING FEDERAL FUNDS TO KIND TO HELP OFFSET THOSE THAT INITIAL AND IMMEDIATE COST. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HOSPITALS THAT'S IN QUESTION. UNTIL NURSING FACILITIES. SORRY COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION QUESTION IS THIS JUST. STOPPING I KNOW YOU TO MAIN ISSUE FOR EVERYBODY HAS. A LACK OF YES A DIFFERENT. STAFFING IMPACTED YOUR BUDGETS. YES ABSOLUTELY WELL AS YOU CAN IMAGINE HOSPITALS WEREN'T BUDGETING FOR COVERAGE OR MASSIVE- VITAMINS LOCKS- SO AGAIN THAT RAMP UP HAD TO COME IN A NUMBER OF WAYS- AND I WANT TO. IT'S CDJ SILVA AND M. ALL THE THAT INTERNET WORKED AT THE BEEN DOING RELATIVE TO GETTING US PROBLEM AND AGENCY AND THE SORT OF MARKET STYLE. US COSTS AND PRICING FOR AGENCY AND TRAVELERS AND THERE IN THE BEGINNING OF COVERAGE THE BIG SEARCHES THE WHOLE NATION WAS USING A LOT OF REGISTRY SO WE HAD NOTHING AND WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON. WAIVERS TEAM NURSING- X. CETERA- TO TRY TO PUT THE PIECES TOGETHER TO DEAL WITH THE VOLUME. RIGHT NOW IS THAT NATIONAL CO RESEARCH HAS DROPPED WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PULL IN MORE NURSES FROM AGENCY ANTI ANTI KRISTOFIC RATIO. SO AGAIN A PARTNERSHIP WITH ALL. AGENCIES AND HOSPITALS IT'S BEEN ABLE TO SHARE AND DO MULTIPLE TYPES OF TEAM WORK- WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO GET THOUGH IT NONE OF THAT WAS BUDGET. AND OF COURSE WE HAVE GOTTEN FEDERAL FUNDING BUT NOT TO THE EXTENT THAT WE NEEDED IT- HOW. HOW DO WE HAVE PROJECT FOR NEXT SET OF HOGAN VARIANCE- SURGES IS THAT IS SORT OF MOVING OUT THERE FOR US HOW WE WILL PROJECT. WHAT WE NEED BUT NONE OF US WERE BUDGETING FOR JUST KIND OF LONG. TERM VOLUME CHANGE. THE NURSING FACILITIES. ABSOLUTELY THE DION I'M REGARDS TO SKILLED NURSE FOR THREE STAFF BEING THEIR HEADS BEEN AND THEN AMOUNT ACOSTA OBVIOUSLY JUST LIKE A HOSPITAL SYSTEMS I BUDGET- SINCE YOU THE IMPACT WAS ON. A LOT OF. HE'D ADDITIONAL YOUR TIME SO CALL YOU KNOW THAT I'M YOU KNOW YOU'RE OKAY WELL AS A LOT OF OVERTIME AS A LOT OF FAMILY MEMBERS YOU KNOW BEING STUCK CALMER CHILDREN BEING HOME I WERE ABLE TO REPORT AND TO WORK AND SO A LOT OF OVERTIME AND DOUBLE TIME LOSING KURDISH ALLOWED OF TOWN INCREASED I'M STOPPING BECAME MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT. AND SO A LOT OF THIS LADY DID TURN TO THE REGISTRY SERVICES AND THEN IN THE LATEST SURGE ON EVEN THE REGISTRY SERVICES A HOSPITAL MENTIONED THOSE RESOURCES- BECAME VERY MINIMAL AND IT WAS REALLY HARD STAFF COMING IN AND BEING WILLING TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE AND BASICALLY WORKED EXHAUSTION IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE RESIDENTS OFF THE CARE THAT THEY NEEDED- CURRENTLY AND WE ARE ALLOCATING RESOURCES FROM THE STATE UNFORTUNATELY SOMETIMES THOSE RESOURCES ARE BEING HIRED FROM ART ARE STILL WORKING THERE PHILIPPINES IN ORDER TO. STAFF THE NEW STATE OUR RESOURCES AND SO WE HAVE FOUND THAT COST OF THE REGISTRY IS YOU KNOW MORE THAN DOUBLED IN SOME AREAS HOW FROM WHAT PRIOR RATES USED TO BE AND THEN ALSO LOSING MANY STAFF TO REGISTRIES HAS CREATED EVEN MORE BURDEN ON THE FACILITY'S. AND SKILLED NURSING WE DO TRY TO PROVIDE A MORE HOME LIKE ENVIRONMENT AND STILL HAVING THE STABILITY OF PEOPLE THAT KNOW THE RESIDENTS IS MOST IMPORTANT STILL HAVING HAVING REGULAR PEOPLE THERE INSTEAD OF TRAVELERS IS HUGE PART OF PROVIDING PATIENT CARE. YOU WOULDN'T ONE OPERATED SCHOOL SUBSTITUTE TEACHERS EVERY. A NEW ONE ALL THE TIME- I THANK THANK YOU MUCH AND I AND I. AND I THINK IT'S JUST A TO KNOW THAT WE SO INTER TO. IN DELIVERING OUR HEALTH CARE. THAT WE REALLY ALL NEED TO THE STATE NEEDS TO. INVEST AND FUND A WORKFORCE. BECAUSE WE WITH PEOPLE OUT DELIVERING- ANOTHER IT MATTERS ANYMORE. AT THE DR PAN I JUST WANTED ALL OF YOU FOR OF THE YOU HAVE DONE. AND REALLY HAVE BEEN- THE BARRIERS THAT THAT'S HOLDING HOLDING US ALL TOGETHER DOT DEPENDED YOU HAVE SOME MORE ON THIS. THANK YOU AND US IDEA IS I THINK AS YOU MAY NOTE THAT- UNFORTUNATELY WE EAT AS MUCH AS WE CAN EVEN PUT MONEY IN THAT DIRECTION- YOU'LL PUBLIC HEALTH WORKERS ARE HIGHLY TRAINED- HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ARE HIGHLY TRAINED AND IT'S- NOT. AND SO IT'S NOT AS IF WELL WE WILL EVEN WHEN THE MONEY SHOWS UP FOR SHORT TERM YOU CAN DEFINITELY FIND- SKILLED PUBLIC HEALTH NURSES OTHER ONES JUST SITTING AROUND WITH NOTHING TO DO THAT ARE READY TO BE HIRED. AND I THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT'S WHY IT'S A LOT OF OVERTIME AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS AS WELL BECAUSE- EVEN IF YOU HAD THE MONEY TO TRY TO HIRE PEOPLE. THEY MAY NOT BE PRESENT- AT LEAST NOT SKILL LEVEL THAT YOU NEED SO- WE NEED TO THAT'S WHY IT HAS TO BE A LONG TERM INVESTMENT INTO RESTRUCTURING ADEQUATE ONGOING STAFFING NOT. SAYING THAT WE CAN JUST TRY TO HIRE PEOPLE AND THE LAST MINUTE FOR A SURGE. THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY WHICH AAIN JUST SPEAKS TO ME REALLY INVESTING IN OUR AND OUR HEALTH PROFESSIONAL WORKFORCE. AS AS WELL AS IT AND DATA. OKAY THING ELSE AND WE'LL MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE- WHICH IS THAT DIRECT. THAT RESPONSE EXPENDITURES COVERED. DIRECT EXPRESS MANAGERS.

TO CONTINUE PROACTIVE RESPONSE OPERATIONS ARE FOCUSED ON MITIGATING THE ACTRESS READ COMMITTEE TRANSMISSION AND BUILDING ADDITIONAL HEALTH CARE CAPACITY- THIS FUNDING WILL PREDOMINANTLY BE USED FOR STATEWIDE ESTING. AND ITS AUXILIARY OR COMPONENTS- INTERVIEW STATEWIDE CAN. WERE TO NEW CONTROL SECTIONS- CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE ALLOWS FOR DECREASED TO THE COVE IN NINETEEN SPECIFIC ITEMS OF APPROPRIATIONS. AND THE FUNDING TRANSFER FUNDING BETWEEN THESE ITEMS OF A PREPARATION SHOULD COVER NINETEEN RESPONSE AND ACTIVIT RECOVERY ACTIVITIES NECESSITATE THE ADJUSTMENT- IN ADDITION. THIS PATROL SECTION WOULD ALLOWFINANCE TO INCREASE ANY OF THE COPA NINETEEN SPECIFIC ITEMS OR ANY FEDERAL TRUST FUND ITEMS AND TO CREATE ESTABLISH ANY NEW ITEMS OF APPROPRIATION AMOUNTS EQUAL TO ANY FEDERAL OR PRIVATE FUNDING BECOMES AVAILABLE. HOW DOES THE CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE TWO THAT WERE PROPOSING. I WOULD PROVIDE FOR THE CONTINUED USE OF THE DISASTER RESPONSE AGENCY OPERATIONS ACCOUNT OF JURY- I FOLLOWING THE CONCLUSION OF THIS FISCAL YEAR. UP FRONT ANTICIPATED COSTS RELATED TO THE GOVERNOR'S STATE OF EMERGENCY ROP RECLAMATION ON MARCH FOURTH OF LAST YEAR WOULD HAVE NINETEEN. IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE VERY SUS THE OF THE SPECIFIC LINE ITEMS OF SUPPORT FOR THE DEPARTMENTS THAT DISCUSSED THE PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY FORTY MILLION. RESTED MATED STATEWIDE HOSPITAL IMMEASURABLE SURGE. PREPARATION- EIGHT EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION FOR THAT CONTACT TRACING. HUNDRED FORTY THREE TWENTY MILLION FOR THAT AN EMERGENCY OPERATIONS COSTS ABOUT A- HUNDRED SEVENTY SEVEN POINT FIVE MILLION FOR ALLOCATIONS TO INDIVIDUAL APARTMENTS. ONCE WE HAVE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON NEED. THIS FUNDING WOULD CONTINUE TO BE ADMINISTERED THROUGH THE AT THE DRILL OF FUNDING MECHANISM AND CONSISTENT WITH THE PROPOSED. CONTROL SECTIONAL LEVIN POINT NINETY TWO MORE THAN HAPPY TO TAKE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ON THAT- ON THOSE CONTROL SECTIONS AS WELL IN ADDITION TO THAT. THE AND ITEMS OF APPROPRIATIONS ACROSS THESE VARIOUS DEPARTMENTS- TO THIS THE SECOND QUESTION THAT THE SENATE PROPOSED FUTURE OF THE QUINCY BRANCH LABORATORY. I KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS SIGNALED A WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE OPERATION POST CODE. I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION OR THE AND TO DESCRIBE. THE EVENTUAL USE OF SAID FACILITY- WE'RE REALLY FOCUSED ON GETTING IT RAMPED UP AND WORKING AT A THE NEEDS NOW- AND YOU KNOW THE FUTURE OF THAT LABORATORY. WILL BE DETERMINED- AS AS WE- APPROACH THE- WHICH WAS WE CONTINUE TO WORK THROUGH THIS THIS COVERAGE SITUATION. AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE A VALUED PARTNER- IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. SO WITHOUT ALL CLOSE THIS INTRODUCTION AND- TAKE ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. IN LIGHT OF THE LAST PANEL THE FIRST QUESTION WOULD BE IS IT ENOUGH AND IS IT GOING TO THE RIGHT PLACES. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT- THE MAIN DRIVE BEHIND HIS PROPOSALS TO GIVE THE LEGISLATURE THE BEST POSSIBLE LOOK AT ESTIMATED COSTS SO IF YOUR QUESTION IS IT ENOUGH- WE LOOK AT THE NEED ACROSS DEPARTMENTS WE IDENTIFIED CLEAR AREAS OF RESOURCES THAT NEEDED TO. WE BOOKED THOSE SO THAT THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO- REVIEW THOSE PROPOSALS OF PINE AND WORK COLLABORATIVELY ON ON THAT IS IT ENOUGH. WILK REMAINS TO BE SEEN WERE IN A HIGHLY FLUID SITUATION WHICH IS WHY WE'RE PROPOSING THE STAEWIDE FLEXIBILITIES VIA CONTROL SECTION THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR AN ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO BE PROVIDED BUT OF COURSE- WE WANTED TO BE AS TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE AND ENGAGE IN A IN A TRADITIONAL BUDGET PROCESS WHICH IS WHY WE- THERE ARE BASS TO ESTIMATE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THOSE WIDE RANGING- THAT- ASKS AND RESPONSIBILITIES THE STATE PASSED- SO I GUESS IT INSURANCE. THE ANSWER TO QUESTION IS IT ENOUGH- IN TERMS OF NO KNOWN AS WE'VE DONE OUR BEST TO ADD TO IDENTIFY THOSE IN TERMS OF UNKNOWN UNKNOWNS WE HAVE AOUT FOUR HUNDRED MILLION THAT'S A SORT OF AVAILABLE FOR AB. ALLOCATION AND THEN ALSO TO THE CONTINUED. USE OF THE THREE L. AT- ACCOUNT. FORTY IN THE IN CONCERT WITH THAT OVERALL. YOU KNOW- BUDGET YOUR PREFERRED THE BUDGET PROPOSAL SO WE'RE PROPOSING THIS. AND WIDE RANGING. HALONG COMPASS IN PROPOSAL TO MEET THESE NEEDS AND THEN ALSO- YOU IN THE SPIRIT OF THE JURY- ACCOUNT ALSO AND KEEPING THE DOOR OPEN FOR ADDITIONAL FUNDING EMERGENT SITUATIONS- ONE EXPECTED COSTS THAT- WE CAN'T PREDICT AT THIS TIME. SO- I'D SAY GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'RE WE'RE- WE'RE MEETING THE NEEDS THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AND WE HAVE CONTINGENCIES SHOULD ADDITIONAL NEEDS ARISE. AND I THINK THAT'S- THE INCIDENT THAT THAT IS KEY AND I HOPE YOU ALREADY WITH FOR THE DRILL SYSTEM WHEN. NEW FUNDING COMES IN HOPEFULLY THAT WILL BE ABLE TO PAY THAT MAYBE SOME OF THE OTHER FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN THINGS. THAT THE FEDERAL FUNDS ARE NOT COVERING. AND I GUESS I HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE FOR THE VALENCIA LABORATORY- YOU KNOW EVERY EVERY STEP BACKWARDS IS MONEY LOST SO THERE'S BEEN SOME. ISSUES THAT WOULD ALL COME TO LIGHT WAS THE MISSILE BLOWERS IN THE VALENCIA LABORATORY. SOME IS IN SOME BAD DATA AND ANYTIME WE GET BAD DATA OR BAD TESTING IT DID AGAIN OUR ROADS FEAR HAS TO BUILD BACK UP. CAN YOU DEFEND A LITTLE BIT THE FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE MILLION TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THIS ESPECIALLY IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S GOING TO THIS FACILITY WILL BE USED FOR. AFTER THE END OF THE PANDEMIC. CERTAINLY WELL. FOR THE FOR THE BUDGET YEAR- WE PROJECTED BASED ON. EXISTING TRENDS AND EXPECTED- COSTS AS WE CONTINUE TO RAMP UP TOWARDS 1100% OPERATION OF THE VALENCIA LABORATORY. AND THAT AS WE KIND OF REACH THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. AND ACTIVATIONS MORE WIDESPREAD WE ANTICIPATED AS A SORT OF DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF TASKS SO IN IN WHAT WELL WE MAY NOT HAVE THE FUTURE OF THE VALENCIA LABORATORY FULLY SKETCHED OUT FOR THE ENTIRETY OF THIS PER THE PERIOD OF TIME THAT'S COVERED BY THIS PROPOSAL WE KNOW WHAT THE LAB WILL BE DOING WILL BE PROVIDING TESTING- YOU MEETING THAT THAT. THAT SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR TESTING THAT THE VALENCIA BRANCH LABORATORY WAS BOTTOM LINE TO ME- AND ANY SORT OF FUTURE DISCUSSION ABOUT ITS OPERABILITY AND OPERATIONS PROBABLY. WOULD PROBABLY BE HAPPENING AND IN THAT. EACH ABOUT BUDGET. YEAH AT LEAST FOR THE NEXT TERM NEXT YEAR- PHYSICALLY SPEAKING WE WERE VERY CLEAR ON WHAT THE DEVELOPERS ARE WE DOING AND WE OF COURSE TAKE AT THE WHISTLEBLOWER ALLEGATIONS VERY SERIOUSLY- WILL BE WORKING WITH PUBLIC HEALTH TO- TO ENSURE THAT THAT ONCE YOU BRANCH LIKE TORIES BEING RANG CONSTANTLY AND ACTIVELY. AND PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT WE ENVISIONED FOR RIDE SO- IN TERMS OF- COULD YOU THE FUNDING FOR VALENCIA BRANCH LABORATORY IT IS AN ESTIMATE. BUT IT'S AN ESTIMATE BASED ON ACTUAL EXPENDITURES AND PROJECTED- INCREASES IN CAPACITY INSTEAD LABORATORY AND OF COURSE MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE LEGISLATURE IN A CONVERSATION ABOUT ITS- POSE DRAVID- ROLE IN. THE STATEWIDE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. YEAH IT DIDN'T. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE VOTE. IS HUGE IT'S FOR THE PA I THINK IT'S LIKE. ASKING THE GET THE EDT MY MONEY RIGHT NOW AS SOME THAT'S BEEN VERY PUBLIC THAT HAS HAD SOME ISSUES AND THEN WE'RE GONNA GIVE ANOTHER. FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY THREE. MILLION SO I ALWAYS JUST THINK WHAT MY NEIGHBORS ON THE STREET ARE GOING TO ASK ME. THANK YOU. DR PEPPER. THANK YOU ACTUALLY- AT. THE AT WITH THE ACTUALLY ASK IF WE CAN HAVE ELLIE- COMMENT ON THE CONTROL SECTIONS. I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS GIVEN THEY'RE- GIVING US THEIR BEST GUESS BUT ALSO THE LOW OF CERTAINTY. AND SO I WANTED SHOULD. BE SURE THAT THE CONSOLE CONTROL SECTIONS HAVE SUFFICIENT LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THE NEED FOR. WHAT FLEXIBILITY OF ONCE AS A MUCH LESS ABILITY BUT WHAT'S LIKELY HAVE TO COME ACCOUNTABILITY. AND I'LL BE SURE WE HAVE SUFFICIENT. MECHANISMS FOR ACCOUNTABILITY. SO THAT AS THE MONEY IS BEING SPENT THAT WE HAVE- SUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT- SO L. A. O. CAN YOU COMMENT ON THE CONTROL SECTIONS. THAT WERE FOR TWO BY FINANCE. IN TERMS OF YEAH. THANK YOU YES THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR- AS AS I NOTED IN MY EARLIER COMMENTS AND I THINK I MISTAKENLY REFERRED TO IT AS A ELEVEN POINT NINE FIVE. IT'S ACTUALLY A PROPOSED CONTROL SECTION ELEVEN POINT NINE ONE. THAT DOESN'T REQUIRE ANY NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE- IT WOULD ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE DECREASE OR TRANSFER FUNDS BETWEEN SOME SPECIFIED DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS SPEND FEDERAL FUNDS. AND ESSENTIALLY REQUIRES NO INVOLVEMENT BY THE LEGISLATURE. THE SECOND CONTROL SECTIONAL LEVIN POINT NINE TWO WOULD EXTEND THE JURY- CELERITY- THROUGH THE ENTIRE FISCAL YEAR AND AS I'M SURE YOU'RE ALREADY WELL AWARE- THE JURY- A PROCESS ONLY REQUIRES NOTIFICATION OF THE LEGISLATURE WHEN A TRANSFER IS MADE FROM THE SPECIAL FUND FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES TO THE JURY- SUB ACCOUNT. BUT THAT THE ADMINISTRATION IS ACTUALLY NOT REQUIRED TO INFORM- THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT HOW THOSE FUNDS WILL BE FURTHER ALLOCATED OR WHAT THE- WHICH WHICH- DEPARTMENTS- NECESSARILY. SO SIMPLE FOR BOTH PROPOSED CONTROL SECTIONS- DO YOU CAN DO NOT INVOLVE- THE LEGISLATURE- EARLY TO ANY DEGREE ALL RIGHT SO- LET'S GO BACK TO FINANCE THAN- ELEVEN NINE ONE NO LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION HOW'S THAT ACCEPTABLE- ELEVEN NINE ONE. I'M NOT A PARTICULAR PROPOSAL I WAS IN THE- PROCESS OF DRAFTING OKAY BUT- YOU KNOW ELEVEN NINE ONE NINE- IS A- MORE INVOLVED CONTROL SECTION. BOB WHAT WOULD ESSENTIALLY ALLOW US TO DO IS MOVE THAT I GUESS THE ALLOW YOU TO DO BUT WHAT ABOUT TELLING US WHAT'S GOING ON WHAT YOU'VE DONE OR WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO. WILL THIS CASE BE I THINK THE BCG OUTLINES THE FULL SCOPE OF ACTIVITIES AND FUNDING FOR DEPARTMENT THAT WERE WERE LOOKING TO EXPAND- THE REAL PURPOSE OF THIS IS THERE ARE RESPONSIBILITIES OR- CHANGE BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS RENTS BETTER BETTER FIT FOR ANOTHER PARTY TO DO SO- SO RIGHT I TELL THEM RIGHT AWAY. I REALIZE THAT YOU WERE YOURSELF WERE NOT PERSONALLY INVOLVED- BUT I GUESS YOU'RE SINCE YOU'RE TO. REPRESENT. FROM FINANCE PERHAPS YOU CAN TELL YOUR- RUN IT UP THE CHAIN I THINK THE IDEA THAT THERE'S NO LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION. OR IF THERE'S YOU KNOW- SO I THINK WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT- AND WHETHER DEBTS THE SUB COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE BUDGET COMMITTEE. AND THEN AS I MENTIONED THE G. OLA APPROACH- REALLY WAS NOT DESIGNED FOR THIS ON GOING SO I AGAIN YOU KNOW RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A- MERCHANT SEE WHERE WE Y. GIVES FLEXIBILITY TO THE ADMINISTRATION BILL RESPOND I GET THAT. BUT WE ALSO HAVE ROUTE YOU KNOW OUR- WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING AND OF COURSE OUR FUNDAMENTAL- OUR TO APPROPRIATE. SO I HOPE THAT WE THERE'LL BE SOME REVISITING AT THESE CONTROL SECTIONS IN A WAY THAT RECOGNIZES. AS A CO EQUAL BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WE HAVE THIS- THE OVERSIGHT WE WANT TO GIVE YOU THE FLEXIBILITY THE MINISTRATION OF LIES THAT YOU THE MINISTRATION OF FLEXIBILITY TO ADDRESS THIS PANDEMIC- BUT WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE WE HAVE THE OVERSIGHT AND I THINK YOU KNOW SOMETIMES WE HAVE LOW HINTS OF THINGS DROPPING OUT SO YOU MENTIONED THAT. WE HAVE THE SINGLE USE CONTRACTS NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT IN AGAIN IN A CRISIS. PERHAPS NOT MUCH TIME TO GO GET BIDS AND SO FORTH BUT THEN WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT- THAT THE- CONTRACTING PROCESS IS BEING DONE AND A RESPONSIBLE WAY SO THAT. WE DON'T YOU KNOW SO THAT- WE THERE ARE ISSUES THAT POP UP BECAUSE A SINGLE SOURCE CONTRACTING IT CETERA SO. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT I HOPE WE CAN WORK OUT- PRIOR TO- BEFORE PASSAGE OF THE BUDGET WHERE. OF YEAH WILL. IT WE NEED TO BE SHARP AT THE PUMP CAST. RIGHT AND SO THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THREE BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S ALSO WHY WE HEARTHE LEGISLATURE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE HAVE. INFORMATION AND THERE'S NO LEGISLATIVE NOTIFICATION- THAT CREATES A PROBLEM BECAUSE OF SOMETHING DIDN'T GO TO GO RIGHT WELL IT'S BEEN ENTIRELY AND THAT THE ISSUE OF THE- I GUESS IT. THAT BECOMES ENTIRELY RESPONSIBILITY ADMINISTRATION AND- MAYBE YOU WANT ACCEPT THAT RESPONSIBILITY BUT- I THINK THAT PEOPLE TYPE- THANK THAT WE SHOULD. THAT WE SHOULD SHARE SOME OF THAT SO HOPEFULLY HOPEFULLY MESSAGE RECEIVED. I WILL COMMUNICATE THAT CENTER THANK YOU OKAY THANK YOU. BUT YEAH BUT I DO APPRECIATE THAT THE L. THE EFFORT AND THAT TOO TO HELP US- YOU PROJECTIONS THAT THAT'S ALWAYS A APPRECIATE I KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS THAT NEED TO BE DONE AYE I WOULD JUST MAKE NOTE- IN TERMS OF THE VALENCIA LABORATORY- ELISE HERE TO WRITE UP- THIS VIRUS ISN'T GOING AWAY IN THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR- AS MUCH JUSTAS HARD WE TRY AND UP EVERYTHING SO. I FEELING WE'RE STILL GOING TO BE DOING QUITE A BIT OF TESTING EVEN ONCE WE GET PEOPLE VACCINATED JUST TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE L. BREAKS AND IN PARTICULAR AREAS AND SO WHETHER THAT CAN BE HANDLED BY THE EXISTING SMELL TESTING SYSTEM OR WE STILL NEED THE STUFF OF YOU KNOW THE HELP OF- THE DENTAL AFTER I ALSO MAKE NOTE THAT PART THE REASON FOR THE LABORATORY. WAS ALSO BECAUSE- IT IT HELPED DRIVE PUSH PRICES DOWN ACROSS THE BOARD BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS WE HAD A CONTRACT TO GET A BETTER PRICE AND- SO. THIS IMPACT IS LARGER SO THE TEST IT DOES SO I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOME CONCERNS RAISED BUT- I JUST THINK WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT. THE MULTIPLE FACTS THIS LABORATORY THE POSITIVE X. AXIS LABORATORIES HAD ON. TRYING TO INCREASE ACCESS TO TESTING AND ALSO. REDUCING EXPENDITURES ON TESTING THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OKAY IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE FROM FINANCER OR THE L. A. O. WILL GO ON TO ISSUE NUMBER FOUR ADJUSTMENT TO SUPPORT INFECTIOUS DISEASE MODELING- GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME'S ADRIAN BERASA. I AM THE ASSISTANT DEPUTY DIRECTOR. OF WITH THE CENTER FOR INFECTIOUS DISEASE AND I'LL BE COVERING ISSUES FOR BY TODAY- ALL START WITH A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF RBC HE SUPPORTED FACTIONS DISEASE MODELING. AND I BELIEVE THERE'S ALSO A FOLLOW UP QUESTION INCLUDED IN THE AGENDA REQUIRING I'M HOW THESE MODELING RESOURCES AND EFFORTS COULD YOU HELP ONE ADDRESSING OTHER INFECTIOUS DISEASES- I ALL ALL DRESSED AS PART OF MY OVERVIEW BUT OF COURSE I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS AS WELL.

OKAY THOSE POSITIONS ARE BEING PHASED IN OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. ARE THE VACANCY RATE THAT YOU SEE HERE IS A REFLECTION OF THE FACT REMAINED LOST SOME MEMBERS OF STAFF MEMBERS WHO HAVE CHOSEN TO RETIRE EARLY OR RETIRED MORE MORE. HIGHER RATES AND PRESS IN PREVIOUS YEARS BUT ALSO RECOGNITION THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ADDITIONAL POSITIONS COMING ON BOARD AND WE'RE TRYING TO RECRUIT AND TO OFFER ENOUGH SO THAT KIND OF- WORK WHERE WE NEED TO TEASE OUT A LITTLE BIT BUT THAT'S KIND OF. WHY WE'RE HAVING A PARTICULAR VACANCY RATE OKAY SO NOT HAVING A LOT OF TURNED AND REYES IS THAT LIKE PEOPLE COMING IN AND OUT ITS THAT OKAY WELL WE HAVE A BASELINE OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE RETIRE COBIT MIGHT TRY A FEW MORE PEOPLE RETIRE BUT THEN WE ALSO GET YOU MORE POSITIONS SO WE JUST HAVEN'T BURKE.

ABOUT THAT WE MIGHT SEE A- GREATER UPTAKE. WE HAVE REALLY SEEN A GREATER UPTAKE AND- SO THIS. UPON OKAY- FOR THE COMPLAINTS HE YOU'RE RIGHT THAT WE ARE TRENDING DOWN FROM WHAT WE HAVE REPORTED IN PRIOR YEARS. THE PRIOR YEAR WE ARE HIRING MORE ON THE 75% COMPLETION WITH THEM SIXTY DAYS SO WE ARE TRENDING DOWN OF THIS LAST YEAR.

AT ONE TIME SO THAT WHEN WE DO GO OUT TO INVESTIGATE WE'RE NOT JUST DOING ONE COMPLAINT WE'RE DOING A COUPLE AT A TIME. COME AGAIN THE PURPOSE IS TO MINIMIZE BOTH- STATES THAT PRESENCE IN THE BUILDING. BUT ALSO TO MINIMIZE THE TIME THAT OBVIOUSLY STAFF AFTER YOU STOP WHAT THEY'RE DOING TO ANSWER OUR QUESTIONS ARE COURT RECORDS AND SO. WE ARE MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE ALL. THE MEASURE OF WORK TO DO. WE ARE BEGINNING TO FALL THOSE WHOSE WORK WAS INTO MORE MORE FREQUENT DISTANCE.

DEPEND OKAY QUESTIONS ARE NOT FOUR HOURS THAT NUMBER FOURTEEN WHAT PROGRAM ESTIMATES. THAT AFTERNOON I'M CHRISTINE NELSON FROM THE DEPARTMENT. PUBLIC HEALTH WEIGHT DIVISION. THE WAIT PROGRAMS ACROSS THE NATION HAVE BEEN JUST HAVE BEEN SEEING DECLINES IN PROGRAM PARTICIPATION SINCE TWO THOUSAND TWELVE IN CALIFORNIA WE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN MARCH AND APRIL OF LAST YEAR AND THEN MINOR INCREASES EACH MONTH AFTER THAT. OUR CURRENT YEAR ESTIMATE IS NOW NINE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS PER MONTH. WHICH MATCHES OUR ACTUAL NUMBER FOR LAST MONTH NEARLY EXACTLY OUR BUDGET YEAR ESTIMATE IS NOW NINE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND PARTICIPANTS FOR MY- IN. JANUARY OF TWO THE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO LAST WINTER WE SERVE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE IN COMPARISON TO FEBRUARY TWENTY TWENTY WE WERE EIGHT HUNDRED AND NINE THOUSAND SO WE'VE EXPERIENCED AN 18% INCREASE. SINCE A COUPLE OF HOPE IT PANDEMIC BEGAN AND MOST OF THAT INCREASE WAS IN MARCH AND APRIL OF LAST YEAR. THIS PARTICIPATION CHANGE RESULTS IN A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN FOOD EXPENDITURES. OUR CURRENT YEAR ESTIMATE IS NOW SEVEN HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOOD WHICH IS A ONE HUNDRED AND FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS OR 17% INCREASE FROM THE BUDGET ACT. OUR BUDGET YEAR ESTIMATE IS EIGHT HUNDRED AND TWENTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FOOD. AND THERE'S NO CHANGE TO OTHER LOCAL SYSTEMS FOR STATE OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION TO MONITORING MONTHLY PARTICIPATION CHANGES WE ALSO LOOK AT ACTUAL PARTICIPATION AS A PERCENTAGE OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS. ARE UNDER US DEPARTMENT AGRICULTURE PRODUCES THE ESTIMATE OF ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS USING THE AMERICAN COMMUNITY SURVEY AND THAT'S ALWAYS A COUPLE OF YEARS BEHIND. THE LATEST USDA PROGRAM REACHED RECORD WAS ISSUED IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN. AND INCLUDED TWENTY SEVENTEEN DATA. IN THAT REPORT CALIFORNIA WHICH SERVED 61% OR ONE POINT ONE MILLION PEOPLE OF OUR ELIGIBLE POPULATION. WHILE THE NATIONAL AVERAGE WAS FIFTY ONE PERCENT. THE ONLY STATE WITH A HIGHER PERCENTAGE THAN CALIFORNIA WAS MARYLAND WHO SERVED ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND PEOPLE OR 64% OF THEIR POPULATION. WE'RE EXPECTING A NEW REPORT WITH TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA ANY TIME NOW AND CAN SHARE THAT WITH STAFF WE RECEIVE THAT. USTA'S GRANTED STATES MANY WAIVERS TO FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WORKS SERVICES CAN BE PROVIDED SAFELY. THESE WAIVERS ARE IN PLACE UNTIL THIRTY DAYS AFTER THE END OF THE FEDERAL EMERGENCY IS DECLARED. EXAMPLES OF WAIVERS INCLUDE REQUIREMENTS THAT ALL INDIVIDUALS SEEKING TO ENROLL OR RE ENROLL AND WHAT DO SO IN PERSON. REQUIREMENTS THAT TRANSACTIONS HAPPEN IN THE PRESENCE OF THE CASHIER WOULD DISAPPEAR YOUR TOP ONLINE SHOPPING. ALLOWING FOR REMOTE INSURANCE OF BENEFITS AND ALLOWING OTHER FOOD OPTIONS ONE WEEK FOODS ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN LOCAL STORES. REMOTE SERVICES FOR ENROLLMENT IN NUTRITION EDUCATION CERTAINLY TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO PARTICIPATE AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ALSO HAVE GOOD ENGAGEMENT WITH THESE FAMILIES. IDEALIST FAMILIES HAVE WILL HAVE A CHOICE FOR WHAT BEST MEETS THEIR NEEDS. REGARDING ONLINE SHOPPING WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR EASY T. SERVICE PROVIDER. INTERESTED STORES FOR SHORT TERM SOLUTION AND THERE'S ALSO WORK HAPPENING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO PURSUE VARIOUS OPTIONS FOR LONG TERM SOLUTIONS. SINCE THE WAIVER FOR IN PERSON TRANSACTIONS I TEMPORARY IT MAY NOT BE APPEALING TO STORES TO INVEST IN CHANGES TO THEIR ONLINE SHOPPING WEB PAGES AND SYSTEMS. KNOWING THAT IT MAY JUST BE A TEMPORARY FIX. THIS WEEK THE NATIONAL WITH A SOLICITATION RELEASED THEIR INAUGURAL STATE OF WORK REPORT THAT HAS A LOT OF GOOD INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT WAIVERS THAT HAVE BEEN. ENACTED AND THEIR POSITION ON SOME RECOMMENDATIONS GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. OKAY THE HELLO. DEPARTMENT FINANCE. IT IS INTERESTING AT THE YOUR PROGRAM HAS GROWN WELL WE HEARD FROM CALFRESH THAT THERE'S HAS ACTUALLY DECREASED SO- YOUR YOU ARE YOU ARE SOMEHOW MEETING THE PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AND WHAT PART OF THAT DO YOU THINK YOU'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE.

AND VIDEO APPOINTMENTS THAT IS ONE OF THE TEMPORARY WAIVERS FROM USDA AND THERE SPEND A LOT OF REQUESTS FROM LOCAL AGENCIES IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION IS ALSO WORKING AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL TO PURSUE THAT IS NOT A PERMANENT CHANGE. MORE PERMANENT GOING FORWARD THANK YOU THIRTY DIFFERENT. THANK YOU FOR A PRESENT. I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO CORRELATE THINK IS A CHAIR IS THE DATA WE HAVE FROM OTHER PROGRAMS RIGHT SELF SAMPLE WE'VE ACTUALLY CAL WORKS- WE- SEE INCREASED RITA CALFRESH IS AND- AND SO. DEARLY IT BE INTERESTED WHEN WE APPROACH MAY REVISE WHETHER FOR EXAMPLE. THERE MAY BE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LET'S SAY ON UNEMPLOYMENT AND THEN FILE DOWN A PLANE IT IS ENDING OR ON THE P. AWAY OR WHATEVER AND THEN SUDDENLY NOW WE'RE GONNA SEE A- CASE INCREASE. I KNOW THAT YOU'RE A MENTIONED YET HE'S INCREASE OF 18% LAST SPRING THE WEATHER TO BE ANOTHER BUMP IN CASES. AS UNFORTUNATELY MADE A GROUP OF PEOPLE. AND UNEMPLOYMENT AND I'M UNABLE TO FIND WORK- WE KNOW THAT A LOT OF WOMEN UNFORTUNATELY ARE NOT ABLE TO RETURN TO THE WORKFORCE BECAUSE OF- CHILD CARE SAID NO SCHOOLS ARE STILL CLOSED AT CETERA.

SO COMPARED TO THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT WITH EXPENDITURES OF ALMOST A HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE MILLION- TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE EXPENDITURE ELEVEN YOU IMMATURE RELATIVELY FLAT WITH ONLY A SLIGHT. DECREASE IS DUE TO A DECREASE IN PROJECTED NUMBER OF LIVE BIRTHS. WHICH AFFECTS BOTH ONES REMAINING PNS PROGRAM. HOWEVER. FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO YOUR PROJECT YOU MORE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES- 2% INCREASE IN EXPENDITURE- MERRILY DUE TO OUR B. C. P. FOR APPROVING THE PIANOS PROGRAM WHICH WILL DRAW SHORTLY. THE B. C. D. INCLUDES A NET INCREASE OF TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS MANAGERS TO IMPROVE THE PNS PROGRAM. BY ADDING FIRST LINE CELL FREE DNA SCREENING- ST OF.
