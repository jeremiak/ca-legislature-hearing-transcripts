HEARING. JULY THIRTEENTH TWENTY TWENTY ONE LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A- MORE THAN A QUORUM WHICH IS A GOOD THING. WELL LET ME ASK THE COMMITTEE SECRETARY TIFFANY TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. DALY HERE DALY HERE MAYES HERE MAYES HERE BERMAN. BIGELOW YEAH BIGELOW HERE CALDERON. CALDERON HERE CHEN CHEN HERE COOLEY COOLEY HERE COOPER COOPER HERE FRAZIER FRAZIER HERE GIPSON GRAYSON. GRAYSON HERE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ HERE VOEPEL WHAT WOULD HERE. GREAT CORMS BEEN ESTABLISHED WITH ONE BILL ON THE AGENDA FOR. SO. LET'S GET UNDER WAY. MISTER VICE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WELCOME TO OUR- ONE BILL HEARING. PLEASE REMEMBER THE MAST REQUIREMENT FOR EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM IS IN EFFECT. MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC CAN PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING BY CALLING. 877-692-8957 THE PASSCODE OF. ONE THREE ONE FIVE FOUR THREE SEVEN. CAN ALSO PARTICIPATE VIA THE REMOTE TESTIMONY STATION ON THE NORTH STEPS OF THE CAPITOL OR IN PERSON. CORMS BEEN ESTABLISHED SO THE SUBJECT TO THE HEARING TODAY IS SB THREE THIRTY FIVE BY SENATOR CORTEZ HE- HI I SEE THAT HE'S HERE- THE BILL MAKES SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SECTORS INCLUDING LOWERING THE TIME PERIOD AN EMPLOYER HAS TO REJECT LIABILITY FOR AN INJURY. INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL TREATMENT THE EMPLOYER MUST IMMEDIATELY AUTHORIZED FOR AN ALLEGED INJURY. AND CHANGING THE PENALTY STRUCTURE FOR PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES. I AM EMPATHETIC TO THE AUTHORS CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO CLAIMS BY FIREFIGHTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS FOR PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES THAT ARE DENIED. WHICH IS WHY MY RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS WOULD PROVIDE A MODERATE INCREASE IN PENALTIES FOR UNREASONABLE DENIALS. THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS HAS FOR RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS ONE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS DEALS WITH THE PENALTY AMOUNT. CONSIDERATION WAS TAKEN INTO THE FACT THAT THE PENALTY AMOUNT HAS NOT BEEN CHANGED SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR AND A MODERATE INCREASE TO THE CAP IS REASONABLE AND RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN INFLATION AND THE COST OF LIVING. WITHOUT MORE EVIDENCE OR DATA A LARGER PENALTY. IN MY OPINION IS NOT PRUDENT ESPECIALLY SINCE THESE PENALTIES ARE PAID BY PUBLIC ENTITIES WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS. TO ALLOW THIS MEASURE TO MOVE FORWARD AND CONTINUE DISCUSSIONS IT'S RECOMMENDED WE ADOPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS REFLECTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ON PAGE SIX AND SEVEN. THERE FOR AMENDMENTS. NUMBER ONE DELETE ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL EXCEPT FOR THE PENALTY PROVISION. THAT NUMBER TO THE PENALTY PROVISION OF THE BILL WOULD APPLY TO PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES CLAIMED BY FIREFIGHTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS THAT WOULD APPLY WHEN AN EMPLOYER ON REASONABLY DENIES LIABILITY FOR A CLAIM. IF AN APPEALS BOARD JUDGE DETERMINES THAT THE DENIAL OF LIABILITY WAS ON REASONABLE. THE PENALTY WILL BE 25% OF THE DENIED BENEFITS FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND WHICHEVER IS LESS. THESE AMENDMENTS WOULD ONLY APPLY TO PUBLIC EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THE PENALTY WOULD ONLY BE AVAILABLE. TO FIREFIGHTERS AND PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS WITH PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES. WELCOME MR VOEPEL TO ROUGH I THINK WE HAVE A FULL HOUSE NOW. HERE ON THE COMMITTEE SO- IT WILL BE HELPFUL TO HAVE A MOTION ON THOSE FOR COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS MISTER CHAIR I MOVE THE BILL TO PASS AS AMENDED IS PROPOSING COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. THANK YOU. THERE'S A MOTION AND SECOND- OKAY. AT THIS POINT THOSE AMENDMENTS ARE ON THE TABLE ALL INVITE SENATOR CORTEZ THE TO COME UP IN THE PRESENT HIS BILL. WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY INSURANCE SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MISTER MEMBERS- IN APPRECIATE OF THE WARM WELCOME IT WILL CERTAINLY EXTEND THE SAME TO ALL OF YOU. WHEN YOU HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY COME INTO THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE- I WANT TO START OFF BY THANKING THEM THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR TIRELESS WORK AND CONTINUE THE EFFORT- TO GET TO A HAPPY MEDIUM ON THE BILL I DON'T DISAGREE WITH- THE DESCRIPTION OF COURSE- THAT THE CHURCH IS PROVIDED IN TERMS OF. OF WHERE WE'RE AT- I'M HERE TO PRESENT SB THREE THIRTY FIVE WHICH I THINK IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT WOULD SEEK TO REDUCE. AND DETER UNREASONABLE DENIALS ON WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS AND AS CHAIR JUST INDICATED- WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PRESUMPTIVE WORKERS COMPENSATION COMPENSATION CLAIMS WITH THESE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS. ONLY AND- THOSE OF PENALTIES THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING ARE ONLY AFTER A JUDGE HAS ADJUDICATED- THAT THERE'S BEEN AN UNREASONABLE DENIAL OF THE CLAIM IN THE FIRST PLACE AND I THINK THAT'S PIVOTAL IN THIS DISCUSSION. A IN THE NOW THE BILL BEFORE THE COMMITTEE OUTLINES FOR PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT WERE JUST. A DISCUSSED- BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CHAIR AND- OTHER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M WILLING TO TAKE AMENDMENTS ONE AND TWO AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS- AND WE MADE THAT CLEAR FOR SOME TIME. UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE TO REJECT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THREE AND FOUR AS OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS WHICH DEAL WITH. BUT THE SPECIFIC. PENALTY PROVISIONS. FOUND IN THE BILL. THOSE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WOULD HAVE NO MEASURABLE IMPACT WOULD NOT PROVIDE THE RELIEF THAT OUR PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES NEED AND DESERVE. 55% BASED ON REPUBLIC DATA THAT YOU COULD GOOGLE WHILE YOU'RE LISTENING TO ME 55% OF THESE CLAIMS ARE BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. ALL RIGHT. BUT THE CURRENT STATUTE. WOULD CALL CALLS 410% PENALTY AFTER AND REASONABLE DENIAL. A REASONABLE DONALD IT'S BEEN ADJUDICATED THAT'S TWO HUNDRED BUCKS ON A TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM THAT WAS WRITTEN RECENTLY WITHHELD IS NOT A DETERRENT TO ANYTHING. WE THINK ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE A BIG INCREASE TO GO FROM 10% 225% THAT. A FIVE HUNDRED DOLLAR PENALTY ON THAT SAME TWO THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM ISN'T MUCH OF A DETERRENT EITHER. AND THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN ARRESTED WITH THE MATH TRYING TO COME UP WITH. WHAT IS THE RIGHT NUMBER TO DEFER TO THE TURF EFFECTIVELY DETER FOLKS FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE. OF URBAN APPEAL SYSTEM- ON THESE CLAIMS- AGAIN 5055% A MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE BELOW TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- AS I OFFERED THE COMMITTEE. I AM I WOULD ABSOLUTELY BE WILLING TO A MAN AND A COMPROMISE PROPOSAL- AN AMENDMENT THAT WOULD CREATE A PENALTY. OF FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE BENEFITS OF REASONABLY TONIGHT BUT IN NO CASE IN EXCESS OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHERE THE REST OF THE CLAIMS GO IN TERMS OF DOLLAR AMOUNTS THE HIGHEST CLEAN WE KNOW OF ON THE RECORD. IS TEN MILLION DOLLARS. SO WITH THE ONE HAND I YOU SAY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS THE CAP. ON A MILLION DOLLAR A FIVE MILLION DOLLAR TEN MILLION ARE CLAIMED NOT MUCH OF A DETERRENT THERE BUT WE THINK THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR. CAP IS MUCH MORE APPROPRIATE. OTHER THAN THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND THAT'S BEEN THAT'S BEEN SUGGESTED. I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR AND I BOTH AGREE AND WE DISCUSSED AND APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSIONS THAT IT IS. IN EVERYONE'S BEST INTEREST HERE- TO. TO CREATE A DETERRENT- TO THE UNREASONABLE DENIAL OF THESE CLAIMS- BUT AGAIN I THINK OF THE MATH TELLS US- THAT- THERE'S NOT MUCH OF A DETERRENT IF WE KEEP THOSE DOLLAR AMOUNTS TO VOTE. BUT I WILL SAY THAT. THE DATA ON THE NATURE OF THESE DENIALS. SIMPLY IS NOT COLLECTED. WE KNOW THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS ON A CLAIMS AND WHAT THE- THE ROUGH AVERAGES ARE- AND WERE TOLD THAT THE ROUGH AVERAGE. OVERALL IS ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE I'M ALSO COMMITTED ADELINE ADDIE LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THAT PENALTIES ISSUED. BE REPORTED TO THE AUDIT UNIT OF THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. THAT WAY WE CAN START COLLECTING DATA ON WHAT'S REALLY HAPPENING IN TERMS QUANTITATIVELY IN TERMS OF HOW MANY- AND REASONABLY DECIDE AND WHAT THE ACTUAL PENALTIES ARE THAT ARE BEING ASSESSED WELL THIS IS NOT ONE OF THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS IN THE ANALYSIS ITS DELIVERY ISSUE. RAISED BY THE DISTRIBUTION. DYER'S MARKETS YEAH VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. GAP IN DATA THAT NEEDS TO BE FIXED DOES NEED FIXING. HER TO TESTIFY WITH ME TODAY ARE BRIAN RICE PRESENT. FIREFIGHTERS THE PHOENIX OVER HEALTHCARE WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGE. VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR ATTENTION. THE I RESPECTFULLY- PURCHASE A REASONABLE FOR YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I'M- MISTER RICE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR A TESTIMONY PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MY FRIEND REYES AND THE PRESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS I DID MY FIRE SERVICE CAREER- RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. IS NOTED BY SEN CORTESE WILD SOME OF THE AMENDMENTS BY THE TO MEDIA WORKABLE. WE'RE HAVING THIS BILL. WHILE WE WORK TO REVISE THE PENALTIES IN A MANNER THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LANGUAGE PUT FORWARD BY THE AUTHOR. THAT PROPOSAL WILL PRESERVE THE ABILITY OF THIS BILL TO TACKLE UNREASONABLE DENIALS. IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. REGRETTABLY THE PROPOSAL PUT FORWARD BY THE COMMITTEE UNDER BULLET THREE IN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE SEVEN. THE ANALYSIS WILL CONTINUE THE STATUS QUO AND MY MEMBERS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE THE DENIALS OTHER PRESUMPTIVE CLAIMS. WORKERS COMPENSATION PRESUMPTIVE'S THEIR INVALUABLE PROTECTION FOR FIREFIGHTERS- PARAMEDICS EMTS POLICE OFFICERS PUBLIC SWORN PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS. AND OTHER WORKERS WHO JABR WHOSE JOBS ARE INHERENTLY DANGEROUS INCOME WITH MORE PERSONAL RISK. REMARKABLY FIREFIGHTERS DON'T EXPERIENCE THAT IT KNOWLEDGE MEANT NOR DO POLICE OFFICERS NOTED PARAMEDICS NOR DO EMTS WHEN DEALING WITH THE PRESUMPTIVE ILLNESS OR INJURY. IT'S MORE COMMON NOW FOR EMPLOYER THEIR INSURER OR THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR IN THE CASE OF MANY SELF INSUREDS. TO INITIALLY DENY A PRESUMPTIVE CLAIM FACING NO MATERIAL RISK OF INCURRING PENALTIES IF THE CLAIM IS ULTIMATELY ACCEPTED INJURED FIREFIGHTERS AND THEIR FAMILIES. ARE CARRYING THE PHYSICAL AND EMOTIONAL COST OF AND REASONABLE DENIALS. AND THEY ARE BEING ASKED TO SPREAD SPEND THEIR TIME FIGHTING THEIR ILLNESS IN THE SYSTEM AND IN MANY CASES TO WHAT END. AS THE AUTHOR PROPOSES TO AMEND THIS BILL WOULD RESTRUCTURE THE PENALTIES FOR UNREASONABLE DENIAL OF LIABILITY FOR PRESUMPTIVE INJURY CLAIM TO ENSURE. THAT PENALTIES ARE REAL DETRIMENT A TURRET INSTEAD OF JUST THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS OR AN AMOUNT THAT IS IRRELEVANT- IN THE CASE OF A PENALTY IF IT'S EVEN FILED AT ALL. I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB THREE THIRTY FIVE AND CENTER CORTESE. AND I'M GONNA LEAVE YOU WITH THIS- I'VE DONE THIS FOR A LOT OF YEARS. IN IN THE LAST TWO DECADES THE SYSTEM HAS FIGURED OUT HOW TO DELAY. AND IN SOME CASES NOT A WORD A PRESUMPTIVE OR NOT EVEN RECOGNIZE IT AND SO AS YOU DEBATE AND YOU CONSIDER THIS I WANT YOU TO CONSIDER. KIM ANGELO- I PERSONALLY DOCUMENTED TWO DECADES OF OVER FIFTEEN KNOWN CARCINOGENIC- SUBSTANCES IN EXPOSURES HUNDREDS. KIM DID NOT. SHE DID NOT SHE WAS NOT OF SHE HAD A BREAST CANCER SIMPLE BREAST CANCER IN HEARING HER TERMS SHE WAS NOT AWARDED A PRESUMPTIVE INJURY STATUS SHE WAS COMPENSATED BUT SHE COULD SHE CAN GET IT THE OTHER ONE RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO MATT BARRETT I SAT WITH YOU IN HIS WIFE LORI. DOWNTOWN WELL WE HAD TO LISTEN TO THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS. NOT BRING ANY EVIDENCE. NOT BRING ANY EMPIRICAL DATA ON THE CANCER THAT HE CONTRACTED TRACTOR. TO REFUTE IT FROM BEING JOB CAUSED BACK ALMOST MATT DID DIE AND HE BARELY. LIVED TO SEE HIS CASE AWARDED. RIGHT NOW WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS REALLY SIMPLE. AND SORRY ABOUT THAT IT'S HARD TO BREATHE- IT'S TIME TO QUIT PROTECTING THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS AND START PROTECTING YOUR FIREFIGHTERS IN YOUR POLICE OFFICERS AND YOUR EMTS AND YOUR PARAMEDICS WHO ARE OUT ON THE FRONT LINES RIGHT NOW AS I SPEAK. THE SYSTEM IS FIGURED OUT A WAY TO SHORT CIRCUIT WHAT WAS A VERY GOOD LAW WHEN IT WENT INTO PLACE IN THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW IS PROTECTING THE PROFIT. EVERY ONE OF THOSE EVERY ONE OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN RIGHT NOW WE'RE A DOLLAR SIGN IN THE DEBIT PILE. PERIOD AND I'M ASKING YOU TO CHANGE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER RICE- MISTER DUDLEY PHOENIX. FORMER JUDGE THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR RIGHT- CHECK OF A LIE THE WAY OF TWO MINUTES SIR OKAY I'LL TRY TO MAKE IT AS SUCH GERMAN DAILY IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANKS VERY MUCH FOR HEARING ME OUT- I'VE BEEN IN WORKERS COMP FOR OVER THIRTY ONE YEARS- OF THE FIRST SIXTEEN YEARS I WAS IN OUT THIS ATTORNEY FOCUSED ON PUBLIC SAFETY CASES FIREFIGHTERS C. H. B. AND THAT AND THOSE SORTS OF EMPLOYEES. I THEN BECAME A JUDGE FOR TWELVE YEARS- IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN I WAS- THE WORKERS COMP JUDGE OF THE YEAR- BY THE CALIFORNIA STATE BAR. AND THEN A- STEP DOWN FROM THE BENCH IN THE LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN BACK REPRESENTING PUBLIC SAFETY EMPLOYEES. SO I REALLY HAVE A LARGER VIEW OF WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THESE CASES. AND MY FIRST PERIOD OF EMPLOYMENT AS NAFTA TOURNEY. IT WAS UNCOMMON TO HAVE A PRESUMPTIVE CASE TONIGHT IS I'M SURE A LOT OF YOU KNOW THERE'S A PATH BUT AMENDMENT BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT. WHICH REALLY STRENGTH IN THESE PRESUMPTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYEE- VERY HARD FOR THESE THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATORS EMPLOYERS TO DENY AND- IF THERE WAS A DENIAL YOU KNEW ABOUT IT IT WAS A BIG DEAL. AND THAT WOULD OFTEN END UP BEFORE THE WORKERS COMPENSATION APPEALS BOARD SO. THAT I HAVE MY TENURE AS A JUDGE AND I COME BACK IN A PRACTICE AND- IT WAS JUST INCREDIBLE THE NUMBER OF THESE CASES THAT WERE GETTING DENIED. VIRTUALLY EVERY CASE THAT I SAW OF A PRESUMPTIVE MAJOR. CANCER HEART THE SORTS OF INJURIES ARE DENIED. AND I'M LIKE TAKE A LOOK WHAT COULD HAPPEN WHAT WHY THE CHANGE IN THESE CASES SPECIFICALLY AND YOU GO BACK TO GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER AND SENATE BILL EIGHT NINE NINE WHERE THE PENALTY STRUCTURE IN WORKERS COMP WITH SO RADICALLY CHANGED WHERE. YOU HAD A CAP PLACED ON IT AND YOU HAD THE PENALTY ONLY OPPOSE AGAINST THE BENEFIT ACTUALLY DELAYED AS OPPOSED TO THE ENTIRE SPECIES OF BENEFITS- AND BECAUSE OF THAT CHANGE THESE. EMPLOYERS FIGURED OUT THESE THIRD PARTY MINISTERS THAT. IT WAS MORE COST EFFECTIVE TO DENY THESE CLAIMS THEN TO PICK UP THE CLAIM AND PROVIDE BENEFITS. OKAY AND JUST AN EXAMPLE I JUST HAD A GUY WITH- STOMACH CANCER. AND HE WAS HOSPITALIZED AND THERE'S HALF A MILLION DOLLARS IN MEDICAL EXPENSES THAT WERE. INCURRED IN THE- ADMINISTRATOR MADE THE DECISION HEY IF WE DENY THIS. WE ARE A BETTER NEGOTIATION POSITION WITH THE HOSPITAL AND THE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. THEN WE WOULD BE IF WE ACCEPTED THE CLAIM. SO THEY ROLLED THE DICE BASICALLY- UNFORTUNATELY THAT FELLOW PASSED AWAY AND- I JUST SETTLED THE DEATH BENEFIT FOR HIS WIDOW- SO THERE IS DEFINITELY A BUSINESS ASPECT WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW IT IS JUST SIMPLY MORE COSTEFFECTIVE. FOR SEARCH- AND I CURRENTLY HAVE TWENTY FOUR PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES IN MY CASELOAD. THAT'S A 75% OF THOSE ARE CANCER 25% HEART. OF THE TWENTY FOUR CASES IN MY CASELOAD RIGHT NOW. TWENTY TWO OF THEM HAVE BEEN DENIED. THAT'S IN THE FACE OF A PRESUMPTION. THAT'S IN THE FACE OF A DIAGNOSIS OF CANCER WHICH HOW DO WE BUT A PRESUMPTION THAT'S WORK RELATED THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE. TWENTY TWO OUT OF TWENTY FOUR. IT IS SORT OF HARD TO BREATHE IN THIS THING SO THE FIRST TIME I'VE SPOKEN IN A MATTER. OF SO THERE'S A REAL COST OF THIS DELAY. I MENTIONED MISTER WHITE LEE WHO UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY. I CAN GIVE YOU STORY AFTER STORY AFTER STORY. OF PEOPLE IN THE UNCERTAIN PLACE OF. IS MY CLEAN GOING TO BE ACCEPTED OR NOT. RIGHT WHERE DO I GO FOR MEDICAL CARE. AM I GONNA BURN ALL OF MY SICK LEAVE CREDITS. HOW MY GOING TO SUPPORT MY FAMILY DURING THIS TIME. THERE'S A REAL COST TO THESE DENIALS AND THEY'RE HAPPENING ALMOST EVERY ONE OF THESE CASES. MY TIME IS PROBABLY CLOSE TO RUNNING OUT- THAT. I'LL JUST SAY THAT THE CURRENT PROPOSAL OF INCREASING. THE PENALTY AMOUNTS TO TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS GONNA BE INSIGNIFICANT. IT JUST WILL NOT DO THE TRICK YOU GUYS. AND LADIES IT'S JUST IT'S NOT GOING TO BE. ADEQUATE IT'S NOT GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE- THERE REALLY NEEDS TO BE A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE PENALTY STRUCTURE WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE CASES- MISTER PHOENIX JUST A QUICK QUESTION MY NOTES SAY THAT YOU'RE A FORMER. WORKERS COMPENSATION JUDGE. ARE YOU NOW AN APPLICANT'S ATTORNEY YES YES IT REPRESENTING APPLE SAYS IT CRACKED YES ALRIGHT WHAT ARE STEPPING DOWN FROM THE BENCH A GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO DID PUBLIC SAFETY CASES UNFORTUNATELY PASSED AWAY SO I'VE STEPPED INTO HIS PRACTICE SO. FOR ALMOST LAST TWO YEARS I'VE BEEN BACK REPRESENTING PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TIME TODAY ARAMBULA APPRECIATED. JUST ONE COMMENT I'VE TALKED ENOUGH AND NOT TO YOU SIR THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR TESTIMONY JUST ONE COMMON I'VE TALKED TO MANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ABOUT THE CONTEXT HERE AND I. SPOKE WITH SENATOR CORTEZ THE AS WELL- GENERALLY. WITH SIGNIFICANT REFORMS TO WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. ALL PARTIES ARE AT THE TABLE THE PROCESS IS OVERSEEN BY THE GOVERNOR. WE HAD ONE PROCESS UNDER SCHWARZENEGGER WHICH MISTER PHOENIX MENTIONED THERE WAS ANOTHER PROCESS UNDER GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN MORE RECENTLY. WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE ONE A PROCESS A WORKERS COMP REFORM PROCESS UNDER GOVERNOR NEWSOM- LIKELY IN HIS SECOND TERM. HE'S HE'S OCCUPIED RIGHT NOW WITH VARIOUS THINGS. INCLUDING THE BUDGET AND- AND OTHER MATTERS. BUT IN MY HUMBLE OPINION THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED ON WORKERS COMP REFORM- AND PEOPLE REASONABLE PEOPLE MAY DISAGREE WITH THIS BUT THE I THINK THE BEST WAY TO PROCEED IS TO HAVE ALL PARTIES AT THE TABLE- THEIR MAJOR INTEREST HERE- IN IN CALIFORNIA AND THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM. AND I THINK ANY OTHER APPROACH STARTS TO BECOME PIECEMEAL THERE MAY BE VALID REASONS FOR THE APPROACH. NEVERTHELESS THERE ARE MANY MANY AFFECTED PARTIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. OTHER LABOR BUSINESS AND SO FORTH- THE APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS- ARE STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AND I'VE I'VE DEALT WITH HIM RECENTLY ON A FEW BILLS IN FACT WE HAD A BILL- THAT WAS PRETTY AGGRESSIVE ENOUGH THAT BILL WAS SCALED BACK ON THE SAME THEORY- THAT WORKERS COMP REFORM IS BEST. DONE WHEN EVERYONE'S AT THE TABLE- IT'S A VERY DELICATE COMPLICATED SYSTEM. SO WITH THAT LET'S GO TO THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES. APPARENTLY THE OPPOSITION WITNESSES- GOTCHA GOTCHA EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME- THERE ARE OTHER SUPPORT WITNESSES WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE BY PHONE. AND ALL GO TO THE- MODERATOR NOW THE- EIGHTEEN ANTI MODERATOR- AND LET'S START TO HEARING FROM THOSE FOLKS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THE PHONE LINES IF YOU WISH TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT TODAY PLEASE PRESS ONE FOLLOWED BY ZERO ON YOUR TOUCH TONE PHONE. A. T. T. OPERATOR WILL GIVE YOUR LIGHT NUMBER OFF LINE IN THE BACK IN THE QUEUE AGAIN FOR A PUBLIC COMMENT PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. L. ONE MOMENT WE HAVE ONE QUEUING UP. FOR EVERYBODY ELSE GO AHEAD ONE ZERO. AND WE DO HAVE A COUPLE WITH OPERATORS WHEN. ONE MOMENT MISTER CHAIR. IT'S AN AWKWARD PROCESS BUT WE KNOW YOU'RE DOING YOUR BEST SIR. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE THAT AND OUR FIRST STOP- PUBLIC COMMENT WILL COME FROM MY NINETEEN YOUR OPEN. IN NINETEEN COMMUTERS. YES CAN YOU HEAR ME. YES GO AHEAD. I'M SORRY CAN YOU HEAR ME. WE CAN HEAR YOU HELLO. THANK YOU SO MUCH COOL QUERY WITH THE AMERICAN FEDERATION OF STATE COUNTY AND MUNICIPAL EMPLOYEES CALLING IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU SIR. NEXT. AND IT'S WE'RE GONNA GO TO LINE EIGHTEEN YOU ARE OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. EIGHTEEN TOOK THEMSELVES OUT TO Q. EVERYBODY ELSE PLEASE GO AHEAD HIT ONE FILED BY ZERO AT THIS TIME IF YOU'D LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT- SB. THREE THREE FIVE. MR KERRY NOBODY ELSE'S QUEUING UP AT THE TIME ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE THERE ANY PERSONS HERE IN PERSON WHO'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. ANY PERSONS HERE IN PERSON. ALL RIGHTS AND ANYONE ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL AT THAT. STATION WHICH IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT ANY OTHER PERSONS. IF NOT LET'S GO TO THE OPPOSE WITNESSES- THE FIRST I HAVE TO NAMES THE FIRST IS FAITH GORGEOUS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES FAITH PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FAITH FOR JUST ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF JOINT POWERS AUTHORITIES MOST PUBLIC ENTITIES SELF FIND THEIR WORKERS COMPENSATION COVERAGE AND NOT FOR PROFIT JPA. THEY'VE DONE SO SINCE THE SEVENTIES AND EIGHTIES WHEN COMMERCIAL COVERAGE WAS DIFFICULT TO SECURE FOR PUBLIC ENTITIES AND MISSION IS TO HELP ALL INJURED WORKERS RECEIVE APPROPRIATE CARE AND BENEFITS AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND TO HELP THEM TO RETURN TO WORK AS SOON AS THEY'RE SAFELY ABLE. THE BILL IS FUNDAMENTALLY AN EQUITABLE PUNITIVE AND A GIFT OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND FOR THESE REASONS WERE IN STRONG OPPOSITION TO SB THREE THIRTY FIVE. AS DRAFTED AND AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED BY THE AUTHOR. THE AUTHORS PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TARGET TAXPAYER DOLLARS WITH A 5000% INCREASE IN THE CURRENT PENALTY. WITH NO RATIONAL DATA TO CLEAN BEHIND THESE BENEFITS WE DID DO AN INTERNAL CLAIMS REVIEW OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN DENIED AND I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE BRIEFLY SOME OF THOSE OUTCOMES. AN INTERNAL REVIEW OF OUR CLAIMS OVER THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF SHOWED THAT 20% OF DENIALS WERE DUE TO THE INJURED WORKER REFUSING TO SIGN A STATEMENT OR TO PROVIDE MEDICAL RECORDS. 20% A DENIAL FOR NEGATIVE COVERED CASES. 20% OF DENIALS FOR DUE TO THE PHYSICIANS INDICATION THAT THEY COULD NOT CONFIRM A DIAGNOSIS OF THE STATED INJURY OR REPORTED THAT THE INJURY OR ILLNESS WAS NOT CAUSED BY WORK. RECORDS WERE EVALUATIONS COULD NOT BE OBTAINED WITHIN THE STATUTORY DEADLINE OF NINETY DAYS. WE WISH IT WAS QUICKER WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE ON WAYS TO EXPEDITE THOSE BENEFITS. MANY OF THEM ARE OUTSIDE OF THE CONTROL OF THE PUBLIC EMPLOYER. CURRENT LAW HEAVILY REGULATES THE HANDLING OF CLAIMS AND COMPLIANCE IS AUDITED ANNUALLY BUT FINES IN THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS. FOR BAD PRACTICES AND INCLUDE THE REMOVAL OF YOUR ABILITY TO ADMINISTER CLAIMS. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS UNSUPPORTED DENIAL OF ALL LIABILITY OF CLAIMS A CURSED AND LESS THAN A HALF OF THE HALF OF THE HALF OF A PERCENT. IN THOUSANDS OF CLAIMS THAT WERE AUDITED EVEN WHEN COMPLAINTS THAT HAVE COMPLAINED EXCUSE ME EVEN WHEN CLAIMS TO HAVE COMPLAINTS ARE CONSIDERED AN THOSE AUDITS. ALL PENALTIES OCCASIONALLY PUBLISHED CLAIMS HANDLING THESE PENALTIES SERVE AS A LITIGATION HOOK. THE SIZE OF THE PROPOSED PENALTY WILL CREATE INCENTIVE FOR LITIGATION. ANY DENIED CLAIMS IS AN INCREASED RISK FOR LITIGATION NOBODY WANTS TO GO DOWN THAT PATH THEY WANT TO PROVIDE THOSE TIMELY BENEFITS. HAVING AN INCREASE THAT'S FIVE TIMES THE AMOUNT OF THE DENIED BENEFIT IS A VERY EXCESSIVE PENALTY PAID WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS. THESE TYPES OF PENALTIES THREATENED TO FORCE PAYMENT AND ACCEPTANCE OF NON INDUSTRIAL CLAIMS OR FACE COSTLY AND TIME INTENSIVE LITIGATION. I DO WANT TO BRIEFLY CLOSE WITH A QUOTE FROM THE APPLICANT ATTORNEY FROM SAN FRANCISCO THAT WAS RECENTLY PUBLISHED. IN CASES OF POLICE AND FIREFIGHTERS CONTRACTING CANCER APPLICANT ATTORNEY STILL MUST PROVE THAT THEIR CLIENT EXPOSURE TO CARCINOGENS HAPPENS ON THE JOB. EVEN IF DOING SO DOESN'T OFTEN CONSTITUTE A HIGH BURDEN. ANY POLICE OFFICER WHO FILLED HIS VEHICLE IS EXPOSED TO BENZENE WHICH IS GASOLINE. ANY PATROL OFFICER WHO WORKS IN TRAFFIC AND HAS HIS WINDOW ROLLED DOWN IT'S GOING TO BE EXPOSED TO EXHAUST IT'S NOT A HIGH BURDEN. AND QUOTE. THERE'S NO JUSTIFICATION FOR A PENALTY INCREASE AT THIS SIZE. IT CERTAINLY WON'T ADMINISTER BENEFITS ANY QUICKER BY INTRODUCING LITIGATION WHICH IS MOST DETRIMENTAL TO THE INJURED WORKER. IN ADDITION TO TAX FREE WAGES AND PENSIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO SAFETY OFFICERS THIS BILL PROPOSES BASELESS MULTIPLIERS AND CREATES TAXPAYER FUNDED BONUSES FOR DELAYS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE EMPLOYERS CONTROL. WE'RE WHOLEHEARTEDLY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THIS COMMITTEE TO FIND WAYS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS A STEP IN THAT DIRECTION AND FOR THOSE REASONS WERE OPPOSED. THANK YOU MISS PORGES. AND NOW A FROM THE PRIVATE SIDE OF THE WORLD MISTER JASON SCHMELZER ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC RISK INNOVATIVE INNOVATION SOLUTIONS AND MANAGEMENT AND THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS IT SAID IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK HERE AGAIN AND I JUST WHEN I THINK EVERYBODY IN YOUR STATUS FOR THE AMOUNT OF TIME AND EFFORT THAT HAS GONE INTO DISCUSSING THIS BILL I'M SURE- WITH US BUT ALSO WITH THE OTHER SIDE SO JUST THANK YOU FOR THAT. I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A FIVE. A PUBLIC EMPLOYERS AND PRIVATE EMPLOYERS BUT I'LL COME BACK TO THAT. 5000% IT'S JUST NOT CREDIBLE IN TERMS OF SCALING EXISTING POLICY. TO ADVANCE THAT BILL HERE'S WHY. THERE IS NOT A SINGLE SHRED OF EVIDENCE DATA. TO BACK THIS BILL MISTER CHAIR YOU TALKED ABOUT PRIOR REFORM EFFORTS THAT WERE DONE AT A LABOR MANAGEMENT NEGOTIATING TABLE THE OTHER FACTOR THAT PLAYED HEAVILY IN THOSE NEGOTIATIONS. WAS THAT THEY WERE VERY DATA DRIVEN AND WE DO HAVE DATA THERE IS A TON OF DATA THE LOBBYIST FOR THE SPONSOR SITS ON THE COMMISSION OF HEALTH AND SEES HEALTH AND SAFETY AND WORKERS COMPENSATION. THEY STUDIED THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM NONSTOP IT'S LABOR MANAGEMENT BACKED THE KICKS OUT A LOT OF RESEARCH THIS COMMITTEE FREQUENTLY LOOKS TO THAT COMMISSION TO GIVE US A COMMON SET OF FACTS UPON WHICH TO OPERATE. THE COMMISSION PUTS OUT A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE PAGE REPORT EVERY YEAR THAT SLICES AND DICES THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM UP ONE SIDE AND DOWN THE OTHER PUBLIC SECTOR PRIVATE SECTOR ENFORCEMENT AUDITS ALL OF IT SO FOR. THE OTHER IN THE SPONSOR TO BRING THIS BILL FORD WITH THE COMPLETE LACK OF EVIDENCE SHOULD BE A GIANT RED FLAG. I'VE COME IN HERE TIME AFTER TIME AND TALKED ABOUT THE REBUT ABILITY OF PRESUMPTIONS. WE HAVE A VERY VERY LIMITED ABILITY. UNDER THE LAW TO DEMONSTRATE THAT A CLAIM IS NOT RELATED TO WORK OKAY AND THE ARGUMENT BACK TO US HAS ALWAYS BEEN WELL THE REBUTTABLE. THE LARGEST IMPACT OF THIS BILL IS GOING TO SEND A SIGNAL TO PUBLIC EMPLOYERS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT. BE GOOD STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND THEY SHOULD NOT QUESTION THESE CLAIMS EVEN WHEN. IN THE FEW CIRCUMSTANCES THERE IS EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY BECAUSE IF THEY DO IT. AND THEY'RE WRONG THEY WILL GET HIT WITH A MASSIVE PENALTY. THE APPLICANT ATTORNEY THAT SPOKE A FEW A FEW NUMBERS I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A FEW DIFFERENT NUMBERS PRESENT ALSO DID A REVIEW OF CLAIMS FOR MORE THAN TWENTY FOUR. IN OUR REVIEW OF CLAIMS 86% OF THE CLAIMS WERE ACCEPTED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY. AND OF THE CLAIMS THAT WERE DENIED 1% WERE OVERTURNED. THAT IS NOT US GETTING IT WRONG THE DATA SIMPLY DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS. THE APPLICANT TOURNEY ALSO MENTION THAT THESE PENALTIES WOULD ONLY BE APPLIED ONCE ADJUDICATED BY A JUDGE THAT IS NOT IN FACT THE CASE FREQUENTLY THESE PENALTIES ARE FILED AND THEN THEY'RE LEFT AS PART OF THE SETTLEMENT NEGOTIATION AT THE END OF THE CLAIM. JUDGES IN COURTS DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE TIME TRYING THESE ISSUES BECAUSE THEY'RE RATHER. COMPLICATED AND SO THEY'RE PUSHED OUT INTO THE HALL TO SETTLE THEM THIS IS A SETTLEMENT MAGNIFYING TYPE OF POLICY IT WILL PUT RISK ON THE FILE THAT WILL HAVE TO BE SETTLED. TO AVOID THE RISK OF TRIAL THAT'S THE WAY THE SYSTEM WORKS. AND FINALLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION THIS THAT DOES APPLY TO PRIVATE EMPLOYERS THERE WAS A CODE NINETEEN PRESUMPTION THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR IF YOU LOOK AT THE BILL THE COVERT NINETEEN PRESUMPTION IS INCLUDED IN THE TYPES OF INJURIES THAT ARE COVERED BY THIS BILL THAT PRESUMPTION APPLIES TO. ALL EMPLOYERS STATEWIDE. IT'S ALSO PRETTY CLEAR THAT IN A COMMUNITY SPREAD DISEASE EMPLOYERS ARE. BEING FORCED UNDER THE PRESUMPTION TO TAKE CLAIMS THAT ARE NOT WORK RELATED AND THAT'S FINE UNDERSTAND BY THE STATE THAT THAT- IN A PANDEMIC. WE'RE WE'RE WE GOT OVER THAT LAST YEAR. BUT NOW TO COME IN INCREASED PENALTY ON THOSE CLAIMS. BY 5000% WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE IT'S JUST SOMETHING WE CANNOT SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE- EVERYTHING THAT THAT THE COMMITTEE IS DONEI APPRECIATE- THE AMENDMENTS COMING THE OTHER DIRECTION I THINK A HUNDRED AND 50% INCREASE ON PENALTIES. CERTAINLY BY ANY STANDARD IN THIS LEGISLATURE IS AGGRESSIVE AND REASONABLE- AND- WE WOULD URGE YOU TO BACK THE CHAIR IN THIS PARTICULAR INSTANCE- AND RIPOSTE THANK YOU MISTER SCHMELZER OTHER OTHER PERSONS HERE IN THE ROOM WHO WISH TO SPEAK IN OPOSITION TO THE BILL. MISTER CHAIR WITH YOUR INDULGENCE OF PRIOR WITNESS REFERENCE ME DIRECTLY I JUST WOULD LIKE TO PUT SOMETHING ON THE RECORD IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'D LIKE. I'D LIKE TO CLARIFY OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A BILL IN FRANCE. YOU'VE OFFERED AS THE CHERRY OF OFFERED AMENDMENTS THE AUTHOR IS WILLING TO ACCEPT. THREE OF THE FOUR AMENDMENTS TO THE TO THE FOR AMENDMENTS. LIKE TO ASK THE AUTHOR- TO TALK ABOUT THE OTHER TWO THE TWO MEN MISTER NOT WILLING TO ACCEPT AND WHY. IF I MAY THROUGH THE SURE THING GOING THAT CENTER PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU- BUT- THE FIRST TWO AMENDMENTS OR A LIMITED ANY CHANGES TO ANY TIMELINES FOR- AN EMPLOYER TO DETERMINE COMPENSABLE WITTY SO WE'VE- AGREED TO THAT THERE WAS A REQUEST. THE BILL WAS ORIGINALLY WRITTEN. UP WITH THE TIMELINE CHANGES FROM NINETY TO FORTY FIVE DAYS THAT'S GONNA. ELIMINATE THE CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF IMMEDIATE MEDICAL TREATMENT AND A PLAYER MUST PROVIDE TO AN INJURED WORKER- THAT WAS GOING TO GO FOR TEN THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THOUSAND WE'VE- AGREED TO. SKEWS ME AGREED TO TAKE THAT OUT. OF THREE. IS THE PENALTY PROVISIONS THAT MOST OF THE DISCUSSION HAS BEEN ABOUT TODAY- PAYMENT FOR- IS SORT OF A COMPANION PIECE TO THREE WHICH REMOVES LANGUAGE ALLOWING THE PENALTY TO A PART OF THE FORM OF THE ORDER SO IT'S- SORT OF THE COMPANION TECHNICAL PROVISION. OF IT SAYS HOME. SO IF YOU WANT ME TO TALK ABOUT. WHY NOT THREE. YEAH I MEAN I MEAN IT SOUNDS LIKE WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE THE PENALTIES RIGHT SO WROTE THAT'S ALL THAT'S LEFT TO TALK ABOUT ALL THAT ALL DOWN TO THIS IT'S ALL ABOUT THE PENALTIES NOW SO EXPLAIN EXPLAIN YOUR POSITION ON THAT PLEASE RIGHT RIGHT RIGHT IT'S SOMEBODY THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF IT YOU KNOW- I'VE SPENT THE LAST- TWENTY YEARS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT- IN THE THIRD LARGEST CITY IN THE STATE. AND THE LARGEST COUNTY IN THE BAY AREA- WHEN I GOT UP HERE PEOPLE TOLD ME. BE WHERE YOU'RE GOING TO HEAR A LOT OF EXAGGERATION I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE FIVE THOUSAND. PERCENT INCREASE. OPPOSITION I CAN UNDERSTAND. WHY THEY ONLY WANT TO PAY THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. IF THE AND REASONABLY TONIGHT A THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM WHICH IS THE CASE NOW- WERE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- WHICH IS ALSO A VERY VERY SMALL. I THINK NON PUNITIVE PENALTY REALLY IT'S IT ALMOST DEFIES IT'S ALMOST AN OXYMORON- WE IF YOU WERE TO LOOK AT THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM. AND WE'RE TOLD. THAT THE 25% UNDER THREE. HUNDRED M. M. IF THREE THAT WERE BEING ASKED TO TAKE- IS A HUGE INCREASE OVER THE 10% THAT ALREADY EXISTS. REMEMBER WE HAVE A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. THIS THIS AMENDMENT. THAT WERE BEING **** HAS TO TAKE ALSO CAPS AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. CAPS IS 25% WHICH IS A 150% HIGHER THAN THE OLD 10% BUT NOW YOU COME RIGHT BACK UNDER THE AMENDMENT WITH THE TO CAP THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. PER EIGHT. SO LET'S TAKE A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM LET'S JUST DO THE MATH REAL QUICK. THE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM UNDER THE CURRENT STATUTE. WOULD GIVE YOU A TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR PENALTY. UNDER UNDER THE A COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT SAME TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM BECAUSE YOU HAVE A CAP OF TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. ONLY GIVES YOU FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE. PRETTY GOOD DEAL FOR THE OPPOSITION. UP UNDER OUR A PROPOSED AMENDMENT IT'S FIVE TIMES BUT WITH A CAP OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SO ESSENTIALLY ON THAT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR CLAIM YOU EFFECTIVELY HOWEVER A TRUE 25% PENALTY OF FIFTY THOUSAND AND THAT'S WHY WE THINK OUR MAP IS BETTER. IN AND IT'S MORE ABOUT A DETERRENT- I HAD THE WHAT WHY GO TO A FIVE TIMES MULTIPLIER I SUPPOSE IT COULD HAVE BEEN TROUBLE DAMAGES WHICH IS VERY COMMON STATUTES. THREE TIMES. AS AN ATTORNEY BUT ONCE REPRESENTED A CLIENT WHOSE HORSE. WAS INJURED BY THE NEIGHBORING PARTY- AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WANT TO PAY THE CLAIM FOR THE HORSE- IN ORDER TO STATUTES. INDETERMINATE THERE WERE TROUBLE DAMAGES AVAILABLE FOR THE DAMAGES INCURRED. IN WHAT I CALL THE INSURANCE COMPANY SAID YOU ARE AWARE THAT I WILL BE PUTTING FOR TREBLE DAMAGES HERE THAT'S THE PENALTY FOR NOT HONORING THIS CLAIM THEY DID SO IT SHOULD BE PUNITIVE THEY DID SO IN AND JUSTICE WAS NOT THE LATE- BUT HERE WE HAVE A SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA TODAY WERE THAT TROUBLE DAMAGES STATUTE STILL EXIST FOR HORSE. IF YOUR HORSES IS HURT BY THE NEIGHBOR. YOU GET TROUBLE DAMAGES. IF A FIREFIGHTER IS HURT ON THE JOB. WE'RE TALKING. TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR CAP TO MAKE. MAKE THIS JUST THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND I'VE BEEN MORE THAN HAPPY TO CONTINUE TALK ABOUT TALKING ABOUT WHAT IS THE CORRECT FORMULA HERE BUT I DON'T THINK THREE IS THE CORRECT FORMULA IS I DON'T THINK IT GIVES YOU A TRUE. AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OVER WHERE WE ARE NOW- WHICH REALLY IS NO DETERRENT AT ALL AGAINST THESE CLAIMS COMING FORWARD. THANK YOU. SENATOR CORTEZ CO I'VE ASKED A FEW TIMES- REALLY OUT OF. CURIOSITY BUT ALSO BECAUSE IT'S THE CRUX OF THE ISSUE- THE UNREASONABLE DENIAL. HELLO OFTEN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN A TYPICAL YEAR. ARE THERE UNDER REASONABLE DENIALS OF CLAIMS FOR FIREFIGHTERS THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF AS YOU HEARD WE WERE NOT ABLE TO PROVIDE THE EXACT NUMBER BUT BUT I'M NOT SURE WE NEED THE EXACT NUMBER BECAUSE OF THAT NUMBER ISSUE THEN FRANKLY THIS COMMITTEE HEARINGS A TEMPEST IN A TEAPOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHING A PUNITIVE NUMBER- NOBODY SHOULD BE FIGHTING THIS HARD TO OPPOSE IT IF THEY'RE FEW CLAIMS. THAT WE SHOULD ALL GO ALONG THEIR MERRY WAY IF THE NUMBER IS HI THERE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AN INDUSTRY THAT IS ABUSING THE CLAIMS PROCESS- BUT I'M REASONABLY DENY CLAIMS OR PRESUMPTIVE IN THE FIRST PLACE TO THE PEOPLE THAT WE VALUE MOST IN OUR PUBLIC EMPLOYMENT. OUR FIREFIGHTERS FOR EXAMPLE SO IN THAT CASE I DON'T THINK WE CAN GO WRONG I THINK IF WE WERE TO ACCEPT OF MY MOUTH. OUR SUGGESTION. WITH A CAP OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS- AT FIVE TIMES. IN THERE'S VERY FEW CLAIMS THEN THIS MULTI BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY SHOULDN'T BE SO CONCERNED A MULTI BILLION DOLLAR MUNICIPALITIES SHOULDN'T BE SO CONCERNED IF WE SHOULD JUST MOVE ON- BUT I DON'T THINK MIND IS THAT THIS ISN'T JUST A DIDN'T A DETERRENT AGAINST. A DETERRENT OF UNREASONABLE CLAIMS. BUT IS AN INCENTIVE TO CREATE A MORE SAFE WORK PLACE IN THE FIRST PLACE SO THAT THESE PRESUMPTIVE CLAIMS DON'T ARISE. IT IF THERE'S NO. IF THAT'S NOT. AN ISSUE THEN IT'S NOT IN IT I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY THE MORE FOR FOUNDATION FOR THE- FOR THE COMMITTEE TO TAKE UP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND JUST TO. ONE LAST THOUGHT ON THAT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW. THE SCALE AND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. BUT YOUR BILL ADDRESSES AND- WE TALKED ABOUT THAT IN OUR CONVERSATIONS- AND HI YOU KNOW- IF. TO THE EXTENT THE PROBLEM IS GENUINE- AS I SAID BEFORE I THINK IT CAN BE ADDRESSED. IN AN OVERALL REFORM OF THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM WHEN WE'RE WITH EVERYONE AT THE TABLE- COMPLICATED SUBJECT WHETHER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MISTER COOLEY. I'M SORRY I THOUGHT YOU WERE- NO I WASN'T ACTUALLY WASN'T DONE SO I BUT I SO I APPRECIATE THE INDULGENCE OF THE JOE HEAD MISTER WAS OUT I WOULD JUST. I WOULD JUST SAY LOOK- WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE PENALTY HERE- AND I THINK THAT- PERSONALLY I WANT TO SUPPORT THE AUTHOR HERE TODAY- I WANT TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING- AND SO I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE MOTION- AS- AS THE CHAIR. I THINK THAT. THERE'S OP THERE'S COME TO DESERVE THIS CONVERSATIONS CAN HAPPEN THERE'S THINGS THAT CAN HAPPEN HERE BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THAT WE SUPPORT THE AUTHOR TODAY. GOOD I THANK YOU MR WOOD MISTER COOLEY DO YOU HAVE A- COMMENT. YEAH I JUST WANT A- RESPOND TO SOMETHING I THINK- SENATE QUARTERS HE I THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES. IS THAT THERE IS NOT AN ADEQUATE RECORD LAID DOWN OF THE PROBLEMS. IN THE REALM OF WORKERS COMP INSURANCE THIS ACTUALLY MEANS WE CANNOT REALLY ANALYZE THE PRO AND CON INCENTIVES OF THE WRITTEN WORD AS A PLACE TO WORKERS COMP. I WAS ACTUALLY A YOUNG STAFFER IN THE ASSEMBLY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. WHEN OUR TOWARDS ORIGINAL. CANCER PRESUMPTION BILLS PASSED. I WAS CHIEF COUNSEL TO THIS COMMITTEE. IN THE LATE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. WHEN OUR SYSTEM GOT SO OUT OF WHACK. THAT THE STATE CARPENTERS FUND WHICH IS A WORKER'S COMP INSURER OF LAST RESORT YOU KNOW- IT GOT 285% OF THE MARKET PLACE. IT WAS A CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA WHEN THE WORKERS COMP CARRIERS RETREATED. AND SKIFF WAS. IN THE FOR CARRYING OUT LOW HIS WORK WHICH OF OUR MY COLLEAGUE CHRISTIE BALBOA THERE IS A PART OF TWO OUT OF THAT GRAPPLING WITH THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM THAT WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN NINETY THREE. I'VE WATCHED WORKERS COMP REFORMS UNDER THE GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER GOVERNOR BROWN. ALWAYS IN THESE CONVERSATIONS. THERE IS INVARIABLY A LOT OF PUSHING AND SHOVING FROM THE VERY INTEREST GROUPS- AS WE CAN WE'RE ALL QUITE ACQUAINTED. NONE THE LESS THEY ARE ALWAYS VERY FACT BASED REFORMS HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE BLESSED SINCE NINETEEN NINETY THREE WHICH HAS WORK WHICH CONDUCTED STUDIES A STATE AGENCY. WE HAVE THE RENDON'S TO SUSAN SANTA MONICA THAT DOES A LOT OF WORK FOR THE WORKERS COMP FIELD. VERY OFTEN INVOLVED AND TAP FOR THEIR EXPERTISE TO DELVE INTO THE MEETING OF NUMBERS LIKEWISE- OF THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMP INSURANCE RATING BUREAU WCI ARE BE. LONG TIME PARTICIPANT IN THESE CONVERSATIONS LIKEWISE THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS COMP INSTITUTE. SO IT IS MY MADE TO WORKERS COMP ISSUES ONCE A SPECIFIC QUESTIONS CRYSTALLIZED AND WE PURSUE FAX TO ELIMINATE THAT ISSUE SO THAT IN FACT YOU CAN REACH A CONCLUSION THAT THERE ARE OR ARE NOT INCENTIVES. THAT THE WORDING OF A PARTICULAR PHRASE OR THE OPERATIONS GIVEN PENALTY OR PROCEDURAL HURDLE IS OR IS NOT HAPPILY WORDED OR UN HAPPILY WORK- SO I DO THINK PARTICULARLY DEAL AS AS I KNOW. THE GREAT CITY OF SAN JOSE WHERE I WENT TO HIGH SCHOOL- OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY THESE ARE SELF INSURED ENTITIES. THERE ARE THERE IS A TAX PAYER STEAK AND ALL THESE CONVERSATIONS SO I THINK THE MATTER THAT CONCERNS ME IS JUST THAT. THIS PARTICULAR CONVERSATION IN A CRITICAL TIME ACTUALLY TO HELP OUR CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE GET BACK EMPLOYEES BE HIRED JOBS JUST SORT OF A LACK OF INFORMATION TO SUPPORT THIS PURPOSE SPECIFIC REFORM- THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE ARE ARE NOT FACTUAL QUESTIONS WE SHOULD ASK PEOPLE TO. ILLUMINATE BUT- I ACTUALLY FEEL IT'S- TO KIND OF GO BACK TO THE PRE TWO THOUSAND FOUR LANGUAGE ON PENALTIES WITHOUT A FUNDAMENTAL EXAMINATION OF DATA I THINK THAT'S THE LOGICAL IN A VERY UNUSUAL DIRECTION IN A WORKERS COMP FEEL TRASHY STRONGLY SUPPORT THE CHAIRS- RECOMMENDATION ON BUT I THINK FACTUAL QUESTIONS ARE ALWAYS IN ORDER. AND THE TWO COMMITTEES COULD EVEN INQUIRE- FOR FURTHER STUDIES UT WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES IN CALIFORNIA TO SHED LIGHT ON. MR COOLEY YOUR SUGGESTION OF FURTHER STUDY IS A- AS WELL TAKEN AND I THINK ALL ASK OUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO PUT TOGETHER A- AN OUTLINE FOR THAT VERY THING TO DO A LITTLE BIT MORE FACT GATHERING MISTER GIBSON HAS A QUESTION OR COMMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I MISS HERE I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE TRYING TO WORK A BILL OF MY OWN IT'S UP IN THE SENATE BUT NONE THE LESS- I AM ALSO- IS THE LAST OPPORTUNITY THIS BILL COULD BE HEARD AND THE REASON WHY I ASKED THAT QUESTION IS BECAUSE- I WAS ASKING MY- MY TEAM MEMBER- FOR. THAT AGAIN ALIGNING SOME COMMENTS THAT BOTH MY COLLEAGUES. MADE MENTION OF THE JUST THE DATA OF. HOW THIS BILL IS HOPING. TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM AND I'VE HEARD FROM THE SPEAKERS THAT I DID IN FACT HEAR FROM- THAT THERE WAS NO DATA. TO SHOW- CONCLUSIVELY HOW THIS. HOW THIS BILL IS HELPING A PROBLEM TRYING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT I CERTAINLY I SUPPORT. YOU KNOW OUR OUR MEN AND WOMEN IN UNIFORM SPACE AND PUBLIC SAFETY AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE. BUT I'M JUST HAVING A- SIMPSON RESERVATIONS IN TERMS OF WHERE TO GO AS RELATES TO NOT HAVING THE DATA TO SHOW- DIRECTLY- FOR ME RIGHT NOW IN THE CONVERSATION CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE SENATOR- AND ALSO SOME THE WITNESS THAT I WAS ABLE TO HEAR FROM MY OFFICE BUT I YOU KNOW I'M OF THE OPINION THAT WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THIS THE LAST TIME THIS BILL COULD BE HEARD- UNTIL THIS INFORMATION IS PROVIDED TO US. I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION I THINK IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE ANSWER IS YES IT'S THE LAST TIME IT CAN BE HEARD. BECAUSE THE DEADLINE I THINK IT'S TOMORROW- BUT- IF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ARE ADOPTED THE BILL. LIVES FOR ANOTHER DAY. AND IT'LL PROCEEDS OF THE BILL AS A VEHICLE WILL SURVIVE AND GO TO THE NEXT STEP. HOWEVER IT WILL HAVE BEEN AMENDED IF THE- PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ARE ADOPTED AND IF THE OFF THAT THE SENATOR TAKE THE MEMBERS TODAY. THEN IT GOES TO. APPROACH APPROPRIATIONS YES AND THEN OKAY AND THEN OF COURSE OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR INDULGING THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON AND YOU HIGHLIGHTED AGAIN AS WE'VE SAID TO- WITH ALL DUE RESPECT BECAUSE IT'S VERY VERY TOUGH SUBJECT IN THE- FEELINGS ARE STRONG. ON ALL SIDES BUT THERE. IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH DATA UPON WHICH- TO MAKE A GOOD POLICY DECISION IN MY OPINION- AND- THAT HAPPENS HERE IN THE STATE CAPITAL FROM TIME TO TIME BUT THIS SUBJECT IS A- OF HIGH INTEREST TO MANY FOLKS WE NEED MORE DATA. MISTER GRACE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND- HAVING AUTHORED AB ELEVEN SIXTEEN ELEVEN SEVENTEEN MY PASSION FOR THE CARE AND WELL BEING OF FIRST RESPONDERS SPECIFICALLY FIRE AND- EMS AS WELL AS POLICE- SHOULD GO ONE QUESTION AND- MY AND MY HEART GOES OUT TO EACH AND EVERYONE OF THEM EVERY DAY- SERVING IS- A CHAPLAIN FOR. A PARTICULAR AGENCY I- I FOUND SOMETHING INTERESTING TODAY THROUGH THE TESTIMONY OF BOTH THE- AUTHOR AND PROPONENTS AS WELL AS OPPOSITION- AND THAT IS THAT BOTH OF THEM AGREED ON ONE THING. I FOR SURE AND THAT WAS THE DATE IS NOT THERE IN REST AT RISK OF SOUNDING REPETITIVE TO MY COLLEAGUES AS WELL AS THE CHAIR. I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND SENATOR THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS THIS VERY NOBLE AND LAUDABLE EFFORT TO PROVIDE MUCH NEEDED SUPPORT I KNOW FIRST HAND- WORKING WITH PUBLIC SECTOR SAFETY AGENCY. THE ATROCITIES OF- CASES WHERE IT TOOK SO LONG AND- THERE IS- THERE IS NEED FOR ACTION TO BE TAKEN. HOWEVER I ALSO SEE ON THE OTHER SIDE THAT THE RECORD NEEDS TO BE LAID OUT THE DATA NEEDS TO BE. COMPILED AND PRESENTED AS EVIDENCE SO I DO ASK THE AUTHOR WAS THEIR CONSIDERATION TO PUT SOME TYPE OF STEADY COMPONENT INTO YOUR BILL AND- AND- HOW WOULD THAT HAVE WORKED AND WILL YOUR CONSIDERATION TO IT AND HOW IT ENDED UP TO DATE- BY- BEING THE BILL THAT EXIST BEFORE US. YES WE WILL BE HAPPY SUPPORT- YOU KNOW ANY AMENDMENT THAT- ADDRESSES THE ISSUE OF DATA IN TERMS OF THE STUDY I MENTIONED AND- MY PRESENTATION OUR BELIEF THAT. OF THE DATA SHOULD BE COLLECTED AND SHOULD BE REPORTED BACK TO THE AUDIT UNIT IN THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION- AS WE KNOW. IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE EXACTED PROBABLY BY LEGISLATION OF. THIS BILL OR SOME FUTURE LEGISLATION- IT'S GONNA HAVE TO MANDATE IT IT'S PEOPLE ARE NOT FORTHCOMING WITH THAT INFORMATION WE HAVE HERE TODAY. THERE'S NO DASHBOARD YOU COULD. A GOOGLE UP LIKE SO MANY OTHER THINGS SO WE GET IT. WE UNDERSTAND- THAT THAT DATE IS NEEDED AND FUNDAMENTALLY BELIEVE THAT THE DATA WILL BEAR OUT- YOU KNOW SUPPORT FOR A REMEDY LIKE WE'RE PROPOSING. THANK YOU SENATOR JUST FOR CLARITY'S SAKE I AM NOT OFFERING AN AMENDMENT I WAS JUST AT THE STATE SO I UNDERSTAND I WAS JUST SIMPLY START ASKING THE QUESTION ABOUT. WAS THE CONSIDERATION FOR A STUDY TO BE BUILT INTO THAT FROM THE AUTHOR AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR ANSWER YES THANK YOU. YEAH WE DID DISCUSS IT TO A LITTLE BIT THE- NOTION OF PUTTING A STUDY IN THE BILL- REGARDLESS I THINK THE STUDY. IS NEEDED AND- AS WAS MENTIONED BY SOME OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS- THERE IS A- A DESIRE FOR A GOOD STUDY AND I'M GONNA ASK OUR COMMITTEE STAFFER. ACADIA MALLEY LED BY KATIE O'MALLEY TO. I OUTLINED STUDY IN WILL FIGURE OUT. HOW TO GET IT DONE AND WHO SHOULD DO IT THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. IF MR GO AHEAD MISTER COOPER THANK YOU FOR LONG DISCUSSION TODAY I DON'T THINK THE AUTHOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD BUT I HEARD A LOT OF STEPS TO ANOTHER BY THE END IN BY THE INDUSTRY BUT YOU SHOULD HAVE TO BE TOLD TO KEEP DATA ON YOUR CASE OUTCOMES YOU A LOT OF DATA BUT- SOME THAT IS MISSING. IN THE PENALTIES I MEAN. YOU THINK ABOUT THE PENALTIES WHO KEEPS TRACK OF HIM WAS REALLY BECAUSE- AT SOME POINT. FOR THE MOST PART THESE CASES SETTLE SO. YOU KNOW SO FOR SOMEONE TO GO IN SUIT. AND THE RESULT IS ONLY TWO OR THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO DO IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE SO. I SPENT THIRTY YEARS IN LAW ENFORCEMENT EIGHTEEN YEARS THE MANAGER'S SUPERVISOR. SLASH HE FILLED OUT THE WORKERS COMP FORM. SENT A MAN. IN DELPHIAN PLOIDY THAT WERE AFFECTED BY IT SO I HAVE A- LOT OF HISTORY THAT IN THAT. IN IN TWO CASES NOT PARTICULAR HERE. IN ONE INVOLVES WILL NEVER TEAR THE CAPITAL SHE SPENT TEN YEARS HERE. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND- LATER ON BECAME A LOT FOR SMALL FOR THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. ISSUES ABOVE WOMAN SHE WILK RECTAL CANCER IN. TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. AND IS CONSIDERED A PRESUMPTIVE INJURY. ON DUTY INJURY TOOK THIRTEEN YEARS. FOR THE CASE TO BE SETTLED. WORKERS COMP KEPT PUSHING HER CASE BACK WITH NO CONCERN FOR DEADLINES. OR HEALTH AND WELLBEING. SHE'S NOW DEVELOPED IN THE FORM OF CANCER. FOR IMMUNE SYSTEM WHICH IS CURRENTLY IN HOSPITAL RECEIVING TREATMENT. HER ATTORNEY SAID. THERE'S WORKERS COMP ISSUE ALTHOUGH SHE CHOSE NOT TO PURSUE WORKERS COMP. BECAUSE THEN THEY HAVE THE STRENGTH TO FIGHT IT. SO IN THE IN THE FIRST RECTAL. CANCER CASE- TO THE COLOSTOMY BAG FOR SHE CAME HERE. LAST YEAR'S ASSUMING AND WE WERE ABLE TO PUSH THE BALL FORWARD. IF I GET THE CASE SETTLED. BUT THIRTEEN YEARS. ANOTHER FEMALE OFFICER FOR THE SECOND SHIFT PART IN BOTH OF THEM. SUFFERED A MASSIVE STROKE IN FEBRUARY OF TWENTY THIRTEEN. THE CASE IS STILL IN DISPUTE AS OF OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR. SHE CONTINUES TO SUFFERFROM APHASIA. AT THE DISORDER FOR THAT RESULTS FROM DAMAGE TO PORTIONS OF THE BRAIN. RESPONSIBLE FOR LANGUAGE. AND DYSPHAGIA. DIFFICULTY SWALLOWING AND RIGHT SIDE PARALYSIS. ANXIETY SHE WAS NOT WORKERS COMP BENEFITS. AND TOLD WAS. NOT REPLICATED EVEN THOSE CONSIDERED PRESUMPTIVE ON DUTY INJURY. SO YOU DO HAVE CASES IN. YEAH QUITE A FEW CASES. WHERE THE- WORKERS COMP. DOESN'T APPROVE THIS CASE IN THE PHOTO TESTIFY. FOR MINISTRY NONE OF THEM. ACTUALLY WORK ON- PHIL'S NOT UNCOMMON FOR THE MIDDLE FOR A REGULAR- THESE TWO OFFICERS ARE SWORN TO PROTECT AND SERVE. EVERY DAY PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE AS DO OUR FIREFIGHTERS YEAH WHEN THEY'RE IN AND OUT OF A JOB OUR WORKERS COMP SYSTEM FILL THE SERVE THEM. ON THE WORKERS COMP PERFECT NO. WORKERS CANNOT BE IMPROVED YES. THIS BILL MAKES IMPROVEMENTS TO ENSURE THE STORIES THE AUTHOR STRUGGLING OF FIREFIGHTERS. THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM IS REPEATED OVER AND OVER AGAIN. BUT I BELIEVE IT DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH FROM IT DOESN'T MOVE THE NEEDLE ENOUGH TO MAKE WORKERS COMP LAY FAIR- SOMEONE TALKED ABOUT IT BEING A GIFT A TAXPAYER DOLLARS. YOUR OTHER PUTTING YOUR LIFE ON THE LINE- WHEN YOU'RE GOING IN AND DOING WHAT WE SEE OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT DEAL WITH OUR FIREFIGHTERS- NOW YOU READ THE ARTICLES NOW TO TALK ABOUT. WATCHING THE FIREFIGHTERS TURNOUT GEAR GOOGLE THE CAUSTIC CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS THEY BUILT ON A DAILY BASIS. YEARS AGO THEY'D HAVE THAT. SO YOU YOU SEE MORE MORE FOR A LONG TIME BREAST CANCER FOR WOMEN FIREFIGHTERS WITH A CONSIDER PRESUMPTIVE. THAT JUST CAME ABOUT SO IT'S A SYSTEM WHERE YOU'RE ALWAYS FIGHTING OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. AND LIKE I SAID I KNOW A LOT OF FIREFIGHTERS SIMILAR STORIES. IN THERE FORCED TO FIGHT AGAIN AND AGAIN AGAIN AND CASES ARE DELAYED SO. THIS YET WHO KEEP TRACK OF. CASES THE COUNTY DOESN'T. WE'LL KEEP TRACK OF CASES. THAT'S WORKERS COMP RESPONSIBILITY TO KEEP TRAFFIC AB DEF GENERAL TALK. TO KEEP TRACK OF THE CASES. SO I HEARD A LOT OF STATISTICS. TALKED ABOUT HERE. I DON'T HAVE ANY SPECIFIC FUND CASES PAID. HELLO CASES TAKE FROM BEGINNING TO END. IF YOU HAVE THAT INFORMATION IT WOULD BE A GREGIS. IT WOULD BE A GREGIS FOR OUR FIREFIGHTERS AND OUR PEACE OFFICERS. AND JUST A MIKE IN MY THIRTY YEARS I SAW PLENTY OF CASES BOTH WANT TO COME BACK TO WORK BEFORE THE SHOULD BE RETIRED AND WORKERS COMP DRAG THEIR FEET. AND IT DID THE DAY IT COMES DOWN TO MONEY. WE'RE TALKING PRESUMPTIVE INJURIES NOTHING ELSE PRESUMPTIVE IN PARTICULAR HEART TACKED ON DUTY- KOTEK PERIOD THAT'S PRESUMPTIVE THAT'S THE LAW. IT IS NOT BEING APPLIED THAT WAY THE CANCER PRESUMPTIVE. SO HERE TWO FEMALE OFFICERS I KNOW PERSONALLY THAT HAVE WORKED FOR ME. FIGHTING CASES WE'RE TALKING FOR CASES FROM TWO THOUSAND SEVEN THERE WERE JUST RESULT LAST YEAR FOR RECTAL CANCER THIS WILL WALK AROUND THE COLOSTOMY BAG IN UNIFORM ON DUTY. FOR THIRTEEN YEARS. THAT'S NOT OKAY. ANOTHER OFFICER WHO HAS TWO KIDS HER HUSBAND IS A FULL TIME CARE GIVER HE'S ALSO SERGEANTS SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT HE CARES FOR HER SHE GOT TWO SMALL CHILDREN. HAD A HEART ATTACK. SO LIKE I SAID. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF INVESTMENTS A LOT OF CHANGES. IS NOT PERFECT BUT LIKE I SAID. I MEAN I KNOW WE KEEP ASKING FOR NUMBERS BUT- AT SOME POINT SOMEONE GOT RESPONSIBLE. YOU KNOW IN AND I GUESS THE NUMBERS FOR THE FOR THE MEMBERS. YOU KNOW STRUGGLING WITH THIS. MCCAFFREY'S OFFICE SOME POINT. WHO'S GONNA KEEP TRACK OF THAT THE CASES THAT HAVE BEEN DELAYED AND DRAGGED ON THERE'S A MECHANISM FOR THAT. AND SOMETIMES IT BEHOOVES THE WORKERS CAUGHT. FOLKS TO DRAG THIS CASE WITHOUT BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF FIGHTING ARE YOU TYPING COURTNEY'S DRAGS ON YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS BECAUSE I WORK FOR COUNTY THEY HAVE DEEP POCKETS THEY CONFIDED FOREVER AND THEY DO THAT SOMETIMES IT HAS GOT TO BE A LOT OF CASES IT CAN BE JUST A LIMIT NUMBER OF CASES BUT THE FACT IS THAT HIS DRUG OUT. IN IMPACT SOMEONE'S LIFE. SO I DON'T BELIEVE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AYE AYE YOU MODEST UNIVERSE. WE'RE TALKING YOU KNOW HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLENO BUT HE'S CASES- IS PERSON PLAN A BADGE AND MADE THE COMMITMENT TO PROTECT AND DEFEND- FOLKS OUT THERE AND RESPOND MUST RUN THE BURNING BUILDING- DEAL FOR THE BILL WITH FIREMEN DO THAT IN MEN AND WOMEN DO THAT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW LAW ENFORCEMENT DEALS WITH THAT RIGHT NOW. SO TO ME IT'S NOT IT'S A SMALL PRICE TO PAY AND- I'VE SEEN THIS FIRSTHAND. I'M NOT. MAKING LIGHT OF IT I'VE SEEN IT FIRSTHAND. IN WORKERS COMP. DOES A LOT OF GOOD SOMETIMES BUT SOMETIMES JUST LIKE IT'S A NUMBERS THAT THEY DON'T SEE THE PEOPLE BEYOND THAT THEY'RE BEING IMPACTED THEIR LIVES IN THEIR FAMILY IT'S JUST A NUMBER AS THE DOLLAR THING AND OBVIOUSLY THEY'RE TRYING TO SAVE MONEY. IN THESE WORKERS COMP CASES. THAT'S THAT'S THE REAL FACT IT'S AN ISSUE IT IS A BUSINESS. AND WE KNOW HOW BUSINESS WORKS SOMETIMES NOT ALL BUSINESS IS BAD BUT YOU'RE DEALING WITH PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THEIR LIVELIHOODS AND THEIR FAMILIES SO. IT SOMETHING'S GONNA HAPPEN HERE YOU KNOW AND- I'M SPEAKING FROM THE HEART HERE. AND WE NOTICED ON THIS W. AS IN HER LAST YEAR WITH A COLOSTOMY BAG. YOU KNOW AT SUGGEST YOU KNOW SO- I HAVE A LOT OF RESPECT FOR MY CHAIR- I RESPECT THE HELL OUT OF THEM. AMBER THIS IS SOMETHING FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE THAT I JUST GOT A- I CAN'T I CAN'T GO FOR THE MINUTES ON THIS AND SO- AT THE OF STILL WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BUT YEAH. IT IS WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER AND WE SHOULD DO BETTER FOR THESE MEN AND WOMEN. THANK YOU MISTER COOPER AND- I THANK EVERYONE ON THE COMMITTEE KNOWS I HAVE ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR YOU- ENORMOUS RESPECT FOR YOU THE- OVERRIDING. CONCEPT HERE IS THAT THIS COMMITTEE AND THE FULL ASSEMBLY AND THE FULL STATE SENATE WILL BE DEALING WITH WORKERS COMP REFORM THE DAY IS GETTING CLOSER- WE'RE WAITING FOR A SIGNAL FROM THE GOVERNOR. I BELIEVE IF THE ISSUES ARE S. PRESSING AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY. FOR FIREFIGHTERS. AND I'M SURE OTHER PARTIES WHO WILL WANT TO BE AT THE TABLE HAVE THEIR OWN PRESSING ISSUES AS WELL CITIES COUNTIES- AS MR COOLEY REMINDED US SOME COUNTIES ARE SELF SELF FUNDED. AND SO WE'LL BE DEALING WITH THIS. VERY VERY DIFFICULT SUBJECT BUT WILL BE LIVING WITH WORKERS COMP REFORM IN THE COMING MONTHS AND YEARS- I THINK IN JERRY BROWN'S EIGHT YEAR. MOST RECENT EIGHT YEARS HE TACKLED WORKERS COMP REFORM IN THE IN HIS FIRST TERM- SCHWARZENEGGER'S YEARS IDEA I'M NOT SURE AT WHAT POINT IT WAS TACKLED BUT IT WILL BE TACKLED AGAIN IN THE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AND WILL HAVE A CHANCE TO GET TO HAVE BETTER DATA. AND ALL PARTIES AT THE TABLE- THEY'LL BE ALLOWED TO HEAD BANG AND I'M SURE BUT AT LEAST. EVERYONE WILL BE AT THE TABLE- AND- OTHER MEMBERS OF LABOR TO BY THE WAY LABOR BUSINESS LOCAL GOVERNMENT. HEALTH DISTRICTS EVERYONE WHO DEALS WITH IN WORKERS COMP SO I THINK WE'VE ALL THE- HEARD ENOUGH. MISTER RODRIGUEZ. TECH RESEARCHER MEMBERS YOU'RE NOT LITERALLY GONNA SAY MUCH BUT AFTER JUST HEARING THE DISCUSSIONS AND FROM ALL BOTH SIDES AND CURRENT LOOKING BACK ON MY EXPERIENCE OF THIS YOU KNOW WORKING WITH THE FIRST RESPONDERS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS- AS AN EMT AND HEARING THE STORIES FROM BOTH A POLICE OFFICERS AND FIREFIGHTERS WHO TO THIS DAY ARE STILL GOOD FRIENDS OF MINE. AND MANY STORIES COME TO MIND IN PARTICULAR- FIREFIGHTER GOOD FRIEND OF MINE WHO JUST RECENTLY RETIRED. WHO TELLS ME NOT FREDDIE AYE I JUST RETIRED AND I DON'T EVEN THINK ALL LAST TEN YEARS FIVE YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS OF A MONKEY. BECAUSE OF ALL THE STUFF EVERY THEN RIGHT GOING TO THE HOUSE FIRES CAR FIRES AND ALTHOUGH THE STRESSES. OF THE JOB RINGS ON YOU WORKING TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFTS WAKING UP IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT FROM A DEAD SLEEP. RIGHT THE STRESS OF THE PUTS ON YOUR BODY YOUR HEART IN OTHER THERE'S A LOT OF INCIDENTS WITH WITH HEART ATTACKS AS WELL- COMES TO MIND THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO A LOT TO PROTECT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS BECAUSE ALL THE- ALL THE HARD WORK THEY DO THAT. I DON'T THINK REALIZE UNLESS WERE IN THEIR SHOES RIGHT WORKING THE SHIFTS WHETHER THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR SHIFTS OR- WHEN LAW ENFORCEMENT WORKING THAT NIGHT SHIFT- LIKE MY SON LOVES YOU THINK SOME OF YOU KNOW. MY SON IS A DEPUTY OVER AN L. A. COUNTY IN THE STRESSES HE DEALS WITH MORE SO NOW THAN EVER BEFORE. I'M TALKING. THE NORM COLLEAGUES TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW SOME OF THESE CASES. LASTING TEN YEARS OR SO WORK BECOMES A MIND. MY MOTHER IN LAW SHE RETIRED FROM THE- PHARMACOLOGIC- OVER A BACK INJURY AND WHATNOT AND- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN ALMOST TWENTY YEARS SHE'S STILL FIGHTING HER CASE. AND THE SITE THE TOLD ME THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE. THERE'S ISSUE HERE THAT- NEED TO BE RESOLVED I KNOW IT'S A IT PUTS ME VERY DIFFICULT SPOT RIGHT BECAUSE I CAN KIND OF SEE BOTH SIDES OF THE CONCERNS AND ISSUES- WE NEED OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS COME TO CONCLUSIONS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. HOW TO PROTECT THESE WORKERS YOU KNOW BEING CHAIR OF EMERGENCY MANAGEMENT A NEW COMMITTEE THIS YEAR HAS REALLY PUT ME IN A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE OF THINGS MAKING SURE THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS OUT OF- THE NECESSARY EDUCATION AND TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT TO DO THEIR JOB. TO PROVIDE SAFETY FOR US IN CALIFORNIA BUT ALSO WE GOT A LOOK AT PROTECTING THEM AS WELL IF THEY GET HURT OR INJURED ALL WHILE DOING THEIR JOB SO IT'S VERY TOUGH IT'S DIFFICULT BUT I THINK- THE STORIES I HEAR FROM FOLKS- WE GOTTA DO A BETTER JOB OF TAKING CARE OF THEM RESOLVING THE ISSUES- BUT THEN AGAIN LIKE I SAID I KNOW WE GO BACK AND FORTH REGARDING. THE CAPS IN THE MOUNTAIN AND I WISH WE HAD MORE TIME RIGHT BECAUSE I THINK IT NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO. TO COME TO A BETTER SENSE BUT I THINK OF FOR ME I GOTTA GO WITH MY GUT FEELING WE HAVE TO PROTECT OUR FIRST OUR FIRST RESPONDERS AND WHAT WE COUNCIL. I'M LEANING TOWARDS TOWARDS SUPPORTING THE BILL AS IT IS SO I JUST WANNA SHOWS CONCERNED WITH E AS WELL. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR RUDD.
