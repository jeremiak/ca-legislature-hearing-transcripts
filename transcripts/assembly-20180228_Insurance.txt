I THINK WE'LL GET STARTED HERE IT'S A NINE OH FIVE. THIS IS OUR FIRST HEARING OF THE YEAR THIS IS THE ASSEMBLY INSURANCE COMMITTEE. ONE A WELCOME EVERYONE A TODAY'S HEARINGS FOCUSED ON A WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD. WILL BE HEARING FIRST FROM OUR STATE AUDITOR WHO RECENTLY COMPLETED AN AUDIT OF THE STATE'S. ANTI FRAUD PROGRAMS ALL OF THE ANTI FRAUD PROGRAMS DEALING WITH WORKERS COMP. WELL HERE FROM KEY REGULATORS IN THE SYSTEM AND THE PRIMARY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE SYSTEM. WANNA MAKE A FEW COMMENTS ABOUT THE ONGOING FIGHT THAT WE'VE BEEN ENGAGED IN AGAINST WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD. THE FIGHT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS. IT SEEMS ON ENDING. AND THE BEST ESTIMATES BY EXPERTS FOR THAT SOMEWHERE BETWEEN ONE AND THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY OR LOST TO FRAUD. AND MAKE NO MISTAKE THIS IS MONEY DIRECTLY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF INJURED WORKERS. AND THIS IS MONEY DIRECTLY OUT OF THE POCKETS OF THE EMPLOYERS IN THE STATE. ONE OF THE REASONS I ASKED THE STATE AUDITOR TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE SYSTEM. WAS DUE TO THE SEEMINGLY INTRACTABLE PRESENCE OF IS USUALLY AN ACCEPTABLE LEVEL OF ONGOING FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY. AND. AS WELL THE NUMBER OF PLAYERS IN THE SYSTEM. MAKES IT MORE COMPLICATED. I'VE BEEN LOOKING AT THIS PROBLEM OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AND I'VE AUTHORED A FEW PIECES OF LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES FACING THE SYSTEM. TWO YEARS AGO I AUTHORED AB TWELVE FORTY FOR AN EFFORT TO GET BAD ACTORS THAT OF THE SYSTEM. THAT BILL WAS SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR. THISSESSION I HAVE AB SIXTEEN NINETY SEVEN TO FORMALIZE AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE ANTI FRAUD ANALYTICS UNIT. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. I'VE ALSO INTRODUCED AB. TWO ZERO FOUR SIX SO THE LEGISLATURE CAN ADOPT RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE AUDIT REPORT THAT WERE FOCUSED ON TODAY. WE WILL HEAR MORE ON THAT TOPIC FROM OUR. OUR STATE AUDITOR SHORTLY. THE MEASURES I JUST MENTIONED ARE NOT A PANACEA FOR WANTING THE FIGHT AGAINST WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD BUT I BELIEVE THEY ARE SOUND STEPS IN THE ONGOING PURSUIT OF ROOTING OUT FRAUD. I'M HOPEFUL THE TODAY WE'LL HEAR FROM STAKEHOLDERS WHO MAY HAVE OTHER IDEAS WORTH CONSIDERING. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN THIS IMPORTANT SUBJECT ONE A WELCOME I'M MISTER GRAYSON AND WHOSE. RELATIVELY NEW OR COMMITTEE AND. AND THANK OF OUR COMMITTEE VICE CHAIR OF CHAD MAYES FOR HIS COOPERATION ANNA. AND SUPPORT IN THIS PROCESS. AND WITH THAT WE WILL GET TO OUR. SPEAKERS A WILL START WITH THE. A ELAINE HOW. ARE. STATE AUDITOR. AND I WANT TO SAY. MISSILE I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED SINCE THE DAY I ARRIVED HERE FIVE YEARS AGO I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED WITH THE WORK OF YOUR. YOUR DEPARTMENT AND I CONTINUE TO BE AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE THOROUGHNESS AND PROFESSIONALISM OF YOUR AUDIT. THANK YOU. BUT. I'VE. MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OFF FOR THE RECORD MY NAME'S ELAINE HOW CALIFORNIA STATE OUT AND I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS. OF MISTER CHAIR ABOUT THE OFFICE I DIDN'T VERY PRIVILEGED TO SERVE AS THE STATE AUDITOR AND AND WORK WITH. TREMENDOUSLY TALENTED STAFF WHO ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO WHAT THEY DO. AND SPEAKING OF TALENTED STAFF TO MY RIGHT IS MIKE TILL THEN MISTER TILDEN WAS THE AUDIT PRINCIPLE ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT TO MY LEFT IS A DALE CARLSON MISTER CARLSON AT THE TIME. WAS THE AUDIT SUPERVISOR ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT HAS RECENTLY BEEN PROMOTED TO PRINCIPAL SO HE'LL BE TAKING ON MORE RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THE OFFICE. WHAT I INTEND TO DO IS JUST GIVE YOU A VERY HIGH? HIGH LEVEL OVERVIEW OF THE ISSUES THAT COME MISTER CHILDREN IN MISTER CARLSON WILL BE DISCUSSING IN MORE DETAIL AND CERTAINLY THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE. AND AS I'M SURE MANY OF YOU KNOW AFTER WE ISSUE A REPORT THIS WAS ISSUED IN DECEMBER OF LAST YEAR. WE HAVE A FOLLOW UP PROCESS WHERE EACH OF THE ENTITIES WE AUDITED FOR WHICH WE'VE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS THEY'RE REQUIRED TO RESPOND BACK TO US. AT A SIXTY DAY INTERVAL SIX MONTHS AND ONE YEAR AND THEN ANYTHING THAT'S OUTSTANDING AFTER A YEAR WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE DEPARTMENTS. ARE THE RESPECTIVE AGENCIES TO MAKE SURE THEY GET THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTED SO THE THE REPORT IS BROKEN DOWN INTO TWO SUBJECT AREAS ESSENTIALLY ONE CHAPTER THAT DISCUSSES PREVENTION DICK DETECTION. ARE OF WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD IN MISTER CHILDREN WILL BE COVERING THAT NUMBER THREE KEY ISSUES. ONE WAS RELATED TO INSURANCE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THEIR RESPONSIBILITY. OUR STATE LAW REQUIRES THEM TO HAVE A SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE UNIT THAT SHOULD BE REFERRING SUSPECTED FRAUD TO THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE SO WE LOOKED AT THAT PROCESS. HOW OFTEN? INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE REFERRING US SUSPECTED FRAUD TO INSURANCE AND AND WE HAVE SOME SUGGESTIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT THERE. WE ALSO LOOKED AT THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL ASIANS LOOKING AT DATA ANALYTICS AS YOU INDICATED MISTER CHAIRMAN THEY DO HAVE. A SOME TOOLS THAT THEY PUT INTO PLACE ARE WE'VE ALSO MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS IN THE REPORT AND MISTER TELL THEM WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE EFFORTS THAT WE THINK HINGED. ON DUSTER RELATIONS IS TAKING THAT ARE ARE POSITIVE ARE AND THEY ACTUALLY ARE TAKING STEPS TO USE ANALYTICS AND ACTUALLY IMPROVE THE USE OF ANALYTICS. THE LAST ISSUE MISTER CHILDREN WILL BE TALKING ABOUT IS OUR SUGGESTION THAT EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS WOULD BE ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE IN COMBATING A WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD IT USED IN OTHER INDUSTRIES DISABILITY INSURANCE. A CERTAINLY THE PRIVATE SECTOR USES AS THEY REFERTO AS HE'LL BE SO MISTER CHILDREN WE TALKING ABOUT THAT A BIT SO THAT'S THE DETECTION SIDE. MISTER CARLSON WILL BE SPEAKING ABOUT INVESTIGATION PROSECUTION PRIMARILY THE WORK WE DID IN THIS AREAS WITH THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE. AND LOOKING AT THEIR EFFORTS IN AS TO INVESTIGATING FRAUD. AND SOME OF THE ISSUES WE IDENTIFIED THAT I THINK YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE DEPARTMENT INSURANCE IS VACANCY RATES IN THEIR AND THEIR. INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS THEY'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS THAT WITH SOME. RESTRUCTURING OF THEIR SALARIES ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP A STRONG TO REACH RECRUITING STRATEGIES LOOKING FOR RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO PERHAPS. COME ON WITH THE STATE A DEVELOPING A RETENTION PLAN ANOTHER SUGGESTION WE HAD SO THEIR ISSUES RELATED TO STOPPING THE RESOURCES TO GET OUT THERE AND CONDUCT THESE INVESTIGATIONS. TIED TO THAT IS THERE SPENDING SO THEY DEPARTMENT INSURANCE RECEIVES A CERTAIN ALLOTMENT EACH YEAR AND WHAT WE WERE FINDING IS THAT ALLOTMENT WAS NOT BEING FULLY SPENT BECAUSE THEY HAVE VACANCIES. SO THERE CAN BE A DECISION MADE BY THE FRAUD COMMISSION. TO EITHER. OFFSET FUTURE BY CHARGES TO EMPLOYERS FOR WORKERS COMP OR YOU CAN GET THAT MONEY OUT TO THE DA'S THE DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND SOME OF OUR ANALYSIS WE WERE SUGGESTING THAT. IT MAY BE MORE BENEFICIAL IN THE EVENT INSURANCE HOUSE UNSPENT FUNDS THAT THOSE FUNDS GO OUT TO THE LOCAL D. A.'S WE DID SOME WORK AT THREE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES. LOS ANGELES ORANGE AND SAN DIEGO. AND MISTER CARLSON WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AS WELL SO THOSE ARE THE KEY ISSUES ARE SO AT THIS POINT AMENDED OVER MISTER CHILDREN HE CAN GET INTO MORE SPECIFICS ABOUT. DETECTION. YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GO AHEAD I. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MIKE TILTON AS MISS HOUSE AND I'M NOT A PRINCIPLE TO CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. SO IS MISS HELL INDICATED WE IDENTIFIED WEAKNESSES IN THE PROCESSES OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE TO DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS. AND INSURERS USE TO DETECT WORKERS' COMPENSATION FRAUD. FOR EXAMPLE STATE LAW REQUIRES INSURERS TO INVESTIGATE SUSPECTED FRAUD INCH REFERRED TO CD AYE AND DISTRIBUTARIES OFFICES. THOSE CLAIMS THAT SHOW REASONABLE EVIDENCE OF FRAUD. BUT WE FOUND THE INSURERS VERY SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS THAT THEY SUBMIT. WE LOOK AT DATA FOR TWENTY ONE INSURERS WHO EACH HAD MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUMS. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND SIXTEEN. AND WE CALCULATED REFERRAL RATE PER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUMS. AND WHAT WE FOUND FOR THE TWO YEARS THAT WE EXAMINED IS THAT FRAUD REFERRAL RATES REALLY RANGE FROM ZERO REFERRALS TO ELEVEN REFERRALS PER TEN MILLION DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUM. AND EIGHT OF THE TWENTY ONE INSURERS HAD RATES OF ONE REFERRAL OR LESS FOR AT LEAST ONE OF THE TWO YEARS THAT WE EXAMINED. AND TO THE INSURER SUBMITTED NO REFERRALS AT ALL FOR ONE OF THE YEARS. THOSE EIGHT INSURERS COLLECTIVELY HAD ALMOST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUMS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WHICH REPRESENTS THIRTY ONE PERCENT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION PREMIUMS IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA. AND. WE BELIEVE THAT WHEN ENSURE WITH OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN EARNED PREMIUMS SUBMITS FEW OR NO FRAUD REFERRALS IN A YEAR WE THINK THAT SHOULD AT LEAST PROMPT CD I TO MAKE AN INQUIRY. BUT ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THESE ENSURE REFERRALS ARE THE PRIMARY METHOD THE STATE USES TO INITIATE INVESTIGATIONS. INTO SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS HOWEVER AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT. CD I DID NOT SURE THAT SELECTED LARGE INSURERS WITH LOW REFERRAL RATES WHEN PLANNING ITS AUDITS OF THE SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE UNITS. SO TO REDUCE INSURERS POTENTIAL UNDER REPORTING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD WE HAD A COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS. CD I ONE WE RECOMMEND OF THAT CD I CREATE A PUBLIC REPORT. THAT WOULD RANK WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURERS BASED ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS INCLUDING THE RATE AT WHICH THEY SUMMIT THESE FRAUD REFERRALS. WE ALSO RECOMMEND AT CDI AT A REQUIREMENT THAT IT CONSIDER RATES OF FRAUD CLAIM REFERRALS. WHEN SELECTING INSURERS TO AUDIT AND IT'D GIVE PRIORITY PRIORITY TO THOSE INSURERS WITH HIGH VOLUMES. PREMIUMS AND VERY LOW NUMBERS OF FRAUD REFERRALS. IAN CTI SIXTY DAY RESPONSE TO US ON ITS EFFORTS TO IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS IT INDICATED THAT AS IT HAS ALREADY REVISED ITS AUDIT PLAN FOR FISCAL YEAR SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN. TO INCLUDE A REFERRAL A REVIEW OF THE REFERRAL RATIOS FOR ALL INSURERS. THE ANSWER GIVE AUDIT PRIORITY TO THOSE INSURERS WITH HIGH PREMIUMS AND LOW REFERRAL RATES. CD I ALSO INDICATED THAT IT IT HAS IDENTIFIED A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE RATE AT WHICH ENSURE SUMMIT THE FRAUD REFERRALS. THAT IT'S CONSIDERING INCLUDING IN A PUBLIC REPORT. THAT WILL RANK WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURERS. BASED ON THEIR ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS CDI ANTICIPATES PUBLISHING'S THIS REPORT THIS JUNE. WE ALSO FOUND THAT INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS EXCUSE ME HAD NOT FULLY DOCUMENTED ITS PROCEDURES. FOR IMPLEMENTING A CRITICAL TOOL FOR COMBATING WORKERS' COMPENSATION FRAUD BY PROVIDERS THESE PROVIDER FRAUD CASES CAN CONTINUE ON THOSE FOR YEARS IN A SINGLE CASE. CAN COST INSURERS MILLIONS OF DOLLARS SO TO BETTER FIGHT THIS TYPE OF FRAUD. INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS RECENTLY BEGAN IMPLEMENTING DATA ANALYTICS. AND. THIS ALLOWS YOU TO EXAMINE LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA. TO IDENTIFY PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN WORKERS' COMPENSATION FRAUD. HOWEVER THE DEPARTMENT STILL IN THE BEGINNING STAGES OF IMPLEMENTING THIS NEW DATA ANALYTICS PROGRAM. AT THE TIME OF OUR AUDIT HADN'T FULLY DOCUMENTED. ITS PROCEDURES FOR USING USE ANALYTICS TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL PROVIDER FRAUD. WE BELIEVE THAT DATA ALEX IS A PROMISING TOOL WITH A POTENTIALLY HIGHER RATE OF RETURN AND WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR INVESTOR RELATIONS. TO. IMPLEMENT THESE ANALYTICS EFFECTIVELY BECAUSE PROVIDER FRAUD AS WE ALL KNOW IMPOSES SERIOUS FINANCIAL COSTS ON CONSUMERS. BUSINESSES AND GOVERNMENTS. TO THAT END WE RECOMMENDED THAT TO ENSURE THE GROWTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS DATA ANALYTICS EFFORTS. WE RECOMMENDED THAT INVESTOR RELATIONS BETTER DOCUMENTS. SEE JURORS FOR USING DATA ANALYTICS WITH ITS PROTOCOL MANUAL. IN EARLIER THIS MONTH INVESTOR RELATIONS DID IMPLEMENT THAT RECOMMENDATION AND HAS MORE FULLY DOCUMENTED ITS DATA ANALYTICS EFFORTS. CLUED IN PROCEDURES FOR DATA MINING AND PREDICTIVE MODELING IN ITS MANUAL. FINALLY WE FOUND THAT INSURERS DO NOT ISSUE. A STATEMENT TO INJURED EMPLOYEES THAT PROVIDE AN EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS RECEIVED AND WE BELIEVE THAT THESE STATEMENTS WOULD ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO REVIEW THE SERVICES PROVIDERS BILL TO INSURERS. TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CHARGES. THESE EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS STATEMENTS ITEMIZE THE TYPES OF SERVICES THAT PROVIDERS RENDERED. THE DATES EMPLOYEES RECEIVE THE SERVICES AND THE FEES THAT THE INSURERS PAID ON THE PATIENT'S BEHALF. AND THE STATEMENTS WOULD PROVIDE INJURED EMPLOYEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE SERVICES FOR WHICH PROVIDERS BUILD THE INSURERS. TO IDENTIFY POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT CHARGES. HOWEVER CALIFORNIA DOES NOT REQUIRE INSURERS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION TO ISSUE OR OTHERWISE MAKE THESE YOU'LL BE STATEMENTS AVAILABLE TO INJURED EMPLOYEES. ACCORDING TO THE LOS ANGELES DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE THE LACK OF REVIEW BY PATIENTS. THAT RECEIVE THE SERVICES EQUIPMENT OR THE MEDICATION CREATES OPPORTUNITIES FOR SERIAL BILLING. IN WHICH YOU HAVE PROVIDERS THAT POTENTIALLY ARE BILLING MULTIPLE INSURERS FOR THE SAME SERVICES. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN PUBLIC AGENCIES AND SOME INSURERS OUTSIDE THE WORKERS COMPENSATION PROGRAM. THAT ARE ALREADY USING THESE YOU'LL BE STATEMENTS TO HELP. OUR FIGHT FRIED. FOR EXAMPLE THE U. S. CENTERS FOR MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SERVICES PROVIDES QUARTERLY YOU'LL BE STATEMENTS THE BENEFICIARIES UNDER MEDICARE. AND THESE BENEFICIARIES HAVE DISCOVERED FRAUD THROUGH REVIEWING THE STATEMENTS. AND THAT RESULTED IN PROSECUTIONS CONVICTIONS THE RECOVERY OF FUNDS. IN ADDITION CALIFORNIA LAW DOES REQUIRE INSURERS PROVIDING DISABILITY INSURANCE. PROVIDE THESE YOU'LL BE STATEMENTS TO THOSE SUBMITTING CLAIMS. IN SUMMARY WE BELIEVE THAT THESE HE'LL BE STATEMENTS COULD BE AN EFFECTIVE TOOL TO HELP PROVIDE OR HELP FIGHT PROVIDER FRAUD. IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. AND WE THINK THE BENEFITS OF THE STATE WAS WOULD LIKELY OUT WAY ANY PERCEIVED DRAWBACKS. FOR EXAMPLE ONE THING INSURERS COULD DO TO KEEP YOU BECAUSE DOWN. IS PROVIDE THEM PERIODICALLY. FOR EXAMPLE ONCE A QUARTER BY CONSOLIDATING ALL CLAIMS THAT WERE PAID IN THAT PERIOD. INSURERS COULD ALSO FORMAT EASIER BE STATE IN SOME WAYS THAT MAKE THEM EASIER FOR EMPLOYEES TO UNDERSTAND. FOR EXAMPLE BY USING SIMPLE LANGUAGE EXPLAINING THE MEDICAL CODES AND PROVIDING QUESTION AND ANSWER FORMAT. WE RECOMMENDED THAT THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURERS. PERIODICALLY PROVIDE THESE YOU'LL BE STATEMENTS TO INJURED EMPLOYEES BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT WOULD BETTER ENSURE THAT THE PAYMENTS INSURANCE ISSUE TO PROVIDERS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS ARE BASED ON BALLOTS SERVICES. MY COLLEAGUE MISTER CARLSON IS NOW GOING TO TALK ABOUT OUR CONCERNS REGARDING THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION BROAD. THINK MISTER TILDEN PLEASE GO AHEAD SIR. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS I'M BILL CARLSON I WAS THE TEAM LEADER FOR OUR AUDIT OF THE STATE'S EFFORTS ON WORKERS COMPENSATION ANTI FRAUD THE AREA THAT I'M GOING TO COVER TODAY. DEALS WITH THE INVESTIGATION AND PROSECUTION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. FRAUD. BUT. I'M GONNA TALK ABOUT THREE POINTS TODAY FIRST CD EYES ARE GOING VACANCY RATE AMONG ITS ITS FRAUD INVESTIGATORS. IN THE FISCAL YEAR TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN BUDGET CD I WAS AUTHORIZED TWO HUNDRED THIRTY THREE POSITIONS. AS FRAUD INVESTIGATORS TO GO OUT AND AND PURSUE WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD. AS OF FEBRUARY TWENTY SEVENTEEN CD I WAS STATING THAT IT HAD SIXTY THREE VACANCIES. IN THESE POSITIONS THAT RESULTED IN ABOUT EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT VACANCY RATE. WHEN WE WERE LOOKING WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WAS SEE WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS VACANCY RATE MIGHT BE ON THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO PURSUE FRAUD. AND WE TOOK A LOOK AT ABOUT WE TOOK A LOOK AT THREE DIFFERENT THINGS. NUMBER ONE. CD I. HAS DECREASED INVESTIGATIONS THAT IT IS OPENING FROM CASE REFERRALS. ON PAGE TWENTY FIVE ON TABLE FIVE WE SHOW THAT CD I RECEIVED ABOUT ANYWHERE FROM FORTY ONE HUNDRED TO FIFTY NINE HUNDRED SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT CLAIM REFERRALS EACH YEAR. IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN FOURTEEN CD I OPENED SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR CASES FROM THESE REFERRALS. TWO YEARS LATER BY TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. CDI OPENED ONLY FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT. CASES WHICH IS A DROP OF A HUNDRED AND SIXTY SIX CASES OR ABOUT TWENTY FIVE PERCENT. THE SECOND THING WE LOOKED AT WAS THE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS THAT CDI CLOSED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES. AND WE SUMMARIZE THIS ON FIGURE SEVEN WHICH IS ON PAGE THIRTY SEVEN OF OUR REPORT. WHAT WE'RE SHOWING IN THAT FIGURE IS IN FISCAL YEAR THIRTEEN FOURTEEN CTI CLOSED ABOUT SO TEAM HUNDRED? EXPECTED FRAUDULENT CLAIMS DUE TO INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES AT THAT TIME THAT WAS ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE TOTAL NUMBER SUSPECTED FRAUDULENT CLAIM. ALLEGATIONS THAT IT RECEIVED. TWO YEARS LATER IN TWENTY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. THE NUMBER OF SF SEES CLOSED DUE TO INSUFFICIENT RESOURCES HAD INCREASED BY OVER TWENTY NINE HUNDRED. WHICH WAS ABOUT FIFTY FOUR PERCENT OF THE TOTAL SF SEES. THAT CD I RECEIVE. THE THIRD ISSUE WE LOOK THAT WAS THAT CD EYES HIGH VACANCY RATE CAN HAVE AN EFFECT ON THE ABILITY OF DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES TO PROSECUTE WORKERS COMPENSATION PROG CASES. THE LA DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. PAUL THAT'S THAT IT COULD NOT ADEQUATELY PROCESS ITS CASE LOAD UNLESS CD I HAVE A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF FRAUD INVESTIGATORS TO HANDLE CASES. CDI SOUTH LOS ANGELES REGIONAL OFFICE WHICH WORKS WITH THE LA DA'S OFFICE HAD A FORTY SEVEN PERCENT VACANCY RATE IN FISCAL YEAR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN. THE LA DA STATED BECAUSE IT COULD NOT COMPENSATE FOR CD ICE RESOURCE LIMITATIONS. IT MIGHT HAVE TO DECLINE NEW REFERRALS ESTABLISH A MINIMUM LAS RITERION OR CLOSE CASES DUE TO LACK OF INVESTIGATIVE RESOURCES. IN OTHER WORDS IT WAS A HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE LA DA'S OFFICE TO PURSUE WORKERS COMP FRAUD. BUT OUR SECOND POINT ALTHOUGH CD EYES TAKING CERTAIN STEPS TO ADDRESS VACANCIES WE FEEL CAN TAKE OTHER STEPS AS WELL. CGI'S ACKNOWLEDGE THE HIGH VACANCY RATE IS A PROBLEM. AND IT SOUGHT AND RECEIVED A PAY INCREASE FOR ITS FRAUD INVESTIGATORS THAT WAS EFFECTIVE IN JULY TWENTY SEVENTEEN. THIS PAY INCREASE REDUCE THE GAP BETWEEN CD ICE FRAUD INVESTIGATORS INEQUIVALENT OR COMPARABLE. ABOUT LAW ENFORCEMENT POSITIONS WITH BOTH THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE IN CDC ARE. CD I ALSO SET UP A TEAM RESPONSIBLE FOR RECRUITING ACTIVITIES IN AUGUST TWENTY SIXTEEN. CDS RECRUITING TEAM CREATED RECRUITING PLAN WHICH FOCUSED ON BUILDING NEW RECRUITING EFFORTS AND STREAMLINING ITS PROCESSES FOR HIRING INVESTIGATORS. IT ALSO SET UP A STRATEGIC VACANCY REPORT THROUGH WHICH VACANCIES CAN BE MONITORED. WE IDENTIFY TWO CONCERNS NUMBER ONE CDI ITS RECRUITMENT PLAN DID NOT INCLUDE EFFORTS TO RECRUIT RETIRED OR EXPERIENCE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. WE FOUND THAT OTHER STATES AND THREE TWO OF THE THREE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IS THAT WE VISITED. HIGHER RETIRED OR EXPERIENCE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AS WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD INVESTIGATORS CD ICE PLAN FOCUSED ON HIRING RECENT COLLEGE GRADUATES. OUR SECOND CONCERN WAS THAT CD I CREATED THE RETENTION PLAN. BURKE CB SI I HAD NOT CREATED RETENTION PLAN TO ASSESS THE REASONS WHY IT'S FRAUD INVESTIGATOR FOR LEAVING. THE FIRST STEP IN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER WHEN DEVELOPING A RETENTION PLAN. IS A FORMAL METHOD TO ASSESS EMPLOYEE SATISFACTION THROUGH EXIT SURVEYS OR INTERVIEWS ALTHOUGH CD I SENT VOLUNTARY SURVEYS TO RECENTLY SEPARATED STAFF. IT DID NOT COMPLETE WRITTEN ANALYSES OF THE SURVEY RESULTS. OUR ANALYSIS OF SIX SURVEY RESPONSES FROM FRAUD INVESTIGATOR. SHOWED THAT THEY WERE DISSATISFIED NOT ONLY WITH PAY. BUT ALSO WITH TRAINING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES PROMOTIONAL POTENTIAL AND CD EYES POLICIES AND PROCEDURES. WE MAKE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS FIRST THAT CD I REVISE ITS RECRUITMENT PLAN. TO INCLUDE THE RECRUITMENT AND HIRING OF RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS. AND CDI HAS TAKEN ACTION TO IMPLEMENT THAT RECOMMENDATION. SECOND. WE RECOMMENDED THAT CDI DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A RETENTION PLAN. CDI IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING THAT. PENSION PLAN AND HOPES TO HAVE ADOPTED BY JUNE FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AND THEN LASTLY DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES COULD HAVE YOU CD EYES ON SPENT ANTI FRAUD FUNDS. FOR THE FOUR YEARS THAT WE LOOKED AT THE INSURANCE COMMISSION IN THE FRAUD COMMISSION. AWARDED SIXTY PERCENT OF THE FRAUD ASSESSMENT AMOUNT TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES. WHAT THIS MEANS IS THAT CD I RECEIVE THE MINIMUM FORTY PERCENT REQUIRED BY LAW FOR ABOUT TWENTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL? FOR FIFTEEN SIXTEEN CD I DID NOT SPENT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION OR ABOUT TEN PERCENT OF ITS ALLOCATION. STATE LAW CURRENTLY GIVES THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER IN THE FRONT COMMISSION THE OPTION OF USING UNSPENT CD I FUNDING TO EITHER OFFSET OR AUGMENT FUTURE PROGRAM FUNDING. THE INSURANCE PRESSURE IN THE FRONT COMMISSION MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE TO DISTRICT ATTORNEYS OFFICES IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. WHEN THEY USE CD EYES UNSPENT FUNDS TO OFFSET A SUBSEQUENT YEARS FRAUD ASSESSMENT. CDI DEPUTY GENERAL COUNSEL MENTIONED THAT CD I WOULD NEED PROCESSES FOR DETERMINING HOW MUCH TO REALLOCATE EACH DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND FOR TRANSFERRING THE FUNDS FROM CD I TO THE LOCAL BA'S WE RECOMMENDED THAT CD I DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A PROCESS TO USE ITS UNSPENT FUNDS TO AUGMENT FUNDING. TO THE DA'S OFFICES RATHER THAN OFFSET COLLECTIONS FROM EMPLOYER IN SUBSEQUENT YEARS. AS OF THIS MONTH CDI HIS IMPLEMENTED THIS RECOMMENDATION. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER MISS HOW MISTER CHILDREN AND I. ARE READY TO RESPOND ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU MAY HAVE. WONDERFUL THANK YOU VERY MUCH A VERY VERY FINE OVERVIEW OF YOUR AUDIT IN THE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISS HOWELL AND HER TEAM. ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT. MISTER HARPER HAS ONE IN MS COPIER HAS MY GO AHEAD MR HARPER. AYE I THINK YOU BRING UP AN EXCELLENT POINT IS THE DIFFICULTY IN TERMS OF FINDING NEW INVESTIGATORS IS THAT THERE ISN'T REALLY KIND OF AN ESTABLISHED CAREER PATH PEOPLE AREN'T. ON THIS PATH IN IN HIGH SCHOOL OR FOR COLLEGE AND SO. PERHAPS THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY PARTNER WITH THE CAL STATE FOR THE UC OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT AND SO I JUST WANT TO GET YOUR THOUGHTS. BUT IN REGARDS TO TO TRYING TO LOOK FOR A LONG TERM SOLUTION TO MAKING SURE WE HAVE. A WORKFORCE WHICH IS A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE IN OUR STATES. INSURANCE. IN CDS WERE. GIVE ME SERIOUS RECRUITMENT PLAN DOES DISCUSS A NUMBER OF THOSE THINKS I'M SURE THE CD AYE REPRESENTATIVES CAN GO INTO MORE DETAIL. ABOUT THOSE VERY POINTS WHAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR WAS THE CREATION OF RETENTION PLAN AND HOPEFULLY DWIGHT DOWN HELP THEM IDENTIFY WIRE THE FOLKS LEAVING CDI SORRY TAKING ACTION ON THE SALARY SITE TO TRY TO CLOSE THE GAP. IF THE OTHER COMPARABLE POSITIONS AND WHAT WE'RE HOPING IS IT THAT THE RETENTION PLAN WILL HELP CD I IDENTIFY. WHAT OTHER REASONS ARE THERE THAT PEOPLE MIGHT THAT THEIR FRAUD INVESTIGATORS MIGHT BE LEAVING? AND THEREFORE WHAT ACTIONS IT MIGHT BE ABLE TO TAKE TO RESOLVE THOSE CONCERNS. AND MISS COPIER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND REPORT. A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS JUST IN TERMS OF. OF STAFFING AND. LOOKING AT. HIRING. COLLEGE STUDENTS AS OPPOSED TO MAYBE RETIRED POLICE OFFICERS ARE ARE OUTLINED FORCE ME. DID YOU FIND ANY DIFFERENCE. IN TERMS OF HIRING. BY REGIONS OF THE STATE. I OR WITHIN AREAS OF THE STATE NUMBER ONE AND. I'M ASSUMING THAT. NEWLY HIRED COLLEGE GRADUATES PAY IS LESS THAN A RETIRED POLICE OFFICER PAY. AND YOU HAVE SOME LIMITATION OF LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER HOURS IT CAN WORK. IF THERE WERE RETIRED INTO THEIR THEY'RE NOT COMING BACK INTO SERVICE SO TO SPEAK SOME WONDERING IF THAT AFFECTS. THAT. THE AMOUNT THAT CD I WILL BE SPENDING HAS. THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS AND TEN PERCENT IS DISTURBING NOT TO USE WHEN THEY'RE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S FRAUD AND YOU WANT TO BE ABLE TO STOP IT. IN SOME WONDERING. YOU KNOW. ABOUT THAT IN THEN FINALLY. LOADS OR SERVICE LOADS ARE OR. AND IT DID YOU DO ANY ANALYSIS OF HOW MANY AND INVESTIGATIONS COULD BE CONDUCTED PER PERSON PER YEAR SO THAT WE CAN GET A BETTER IDEA OF. WHAT THE BUDGET LOOKS LIKE AND WHETHER WILL ALWAYS BE BEHIND? THE CURVE IN TERMS OF TRYING TO LOOK AT THIS ISSUE BECAUSE WE DON'T WE JUST DON'T HAVE AN APPLE M. PUT ENOUGH RESOURCES INTO IT. SO IN TERMS OF I WOULD ADDRESS YOUR SERVICE LOVE QUESTION FIRST IN TERMS OF SERVICE LOADS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE DID WHEN WE WERE LOOKING AT THE VACANCY SAYS. WHAT KIND OF IMPACT ON THE ON INVESTIGATED CASES WITH THIS BE AND BECAUSE OF VARIANCES IN THE NUMBER OF CASES OVER TIME THAT CD I LOOK BAD AND THE NUMBER OF INVESTIGATORS THAT THEY HAVE WE CALCULATED YEAH A RANGE OF AN AVERAGE? OF FOUR THOSE SIXTY THREE ON HIGHER POSITIONS WHAT WAS THE MISSING CASELOAD ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. OUR CALCULATION WERE IT WAS A RANGE BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED AND THREE HUNDRED CASES THAT WE BELIEVE CD I COULD'VE INVESTIGATED HAD IT BEEN FULLY STAFFED. REGARDING THE RETIREMENT UNDERSTAND OR WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IF THE PERSON RETIRES FROM A COW PER TYPE SYSTEM BRINGING ON A RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER. CAN AFFECT THEIR RETIREMENT BUT THERE ARE MANY POLICE OFFICERS WHO ARE NOT PART OF CALPERS DEPARTED INDEPENDENT RETIREMENT ASSOCIATIONS AND WHAT WE SAW BUT AT ORANGE COUNTY AND. IN ONE OTHER COUNTY WHICH THEY WERE BRINGING ON RETIRED LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEY WERE. ESSENTIALLY EARNING THEIR RETIREMENT BUT THEY WERE ALSO WORKING FULL TIME AT AT PAY. BUT IN FOR THOSE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. SO IF I COULD JUST MAKE A COMMENT RHETORIC IS THAT. BOMB IT JUST OCCURS TO ME THAT. ONE OF THE THINGS WE MIGHT WANT TO LOOK AT. LONG TERM IS THERE AT. THE END OF THE STATE HIRES PROBABLY THE CATEGORY THAT'S THE HIGHEST CATEGORIES INVESTIGATORS AND. PUBLIC SAFETY. OFFICERS IF YOU LOOK AT C. H. P. AND THEN YOU LOOK AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS THERE THERE ARE AT SWORN OFFICERS THROUGHOUT. THE THE ORGANIZATION AND IT MIGHT BEHOOVE US TO LOOK TO SEE WHETHER THERE ARE THERE'S A WAY FOR US TO CATEGORIZE THAT THE LAB THAT. THE LEVELS THAT YOU CAN MOVE UP SO THAT YOU GET PEOPLE THAT ARE MOVING. THAT THAT HAVE GOOD TRAINING WITHIN THE STATE IN THAT CAN MOVE. ON UP A CAREER LADDER NOT NECESSARILY WITHIN THE SAME ORGANIZATION BUT MAYBE IF THEY MOVE IN INTO OTHER ORGANIZATION IS WELL I JUST. WHEAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AYE A. B. C. YOU'VE GOT THE CA THERE JUST JUST A NUMBER OF. SWORN OFFICER OPPORTUNITIES SO. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT AND MR COOPER WAS NEXT AND THEN WE'LL HEAR FROM MR GRAYSON. I DON'T THINK WITH OUR TEAM FOR IT FOR A VERY THOROUGH REPORT IN THE PUBLIC PART OF PALM IS. WHY YOU WANNA CONVERT FOR THE STATE TO THE STATE'S PAYS IS NOT THAT GOOD? WITHIN THAT WITH ABC NOW DC I. MANY LAST YEAR A. B. C. GOT A RAISE THEIR PROBLEM WITH RECRUITMENT RETENTION. AND SO TO SOME CD I. AND OVERALL IT'S A BIG DEPARTMENT NUMBER ONE I MEAN THAT AVERAGED PLEASE PERMITS PLAY ABOUT A HUNDRED OFFICERS THIS IS A TWO AND THIRTY THREE. AND FURTHERMORE SMOKE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE TO ONCE WELCOMING THE CTI THE HAS NO INVESTIGATIVE EXPERIENCE. YOU WANT VETERAN LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS AT YOUR BEST BET WOULD RETIRED ANNUITANTS OR EVEN FOLKS THAT. WERE DIFFERENT HARMON SYSTEMS THAT EVERYBODY'S NOT PURRS. LOOK LA THEY HAVE THEIR OWN RETIREMENT SYSTEM IS THE SECOND COUNTY AND. IN A SEVERAL OTHER AGENCIES ARM WHAT'S DISTURBING IS THE AMOUNT OF CASES THAT WERE CLOSED. FORTY PERCENT A WORKERS COMP CASES REFERRALS. WE'RE NEVER INVESTIGATED DUE TO LACK OF MANPOWER AND TO ME THAT'S THE THAT'S THE BIG ISSUE. AND ONE THING ABOUT THE STATE HAVING BEEN HERE FOR SOMETIME NOW. WHEN YOU LOOK AT. UPPER MOBILITY PAY. SEES PEOPLE IS A LOT MORE. IS AGENCIES DO A LOT OF LOCAL AGENCIES PAY A LOT MORE SO WHEN WHEN FOLKS ARE COMING OUT OF COLLEGE. IT'S WHY GO OVER FOR THE STATE WE CAN MAKE MORE MONEY SOMEWHERE ELSE AND HAVE MORE UPWARD MOBILITY BECAUSE IT'S TOUGH IT'S TOUGH HERE. SO YOU KNOW HOW WE CHANGE THAT DYNAMIC IN AND RECRUIT THESE FOLKS AND NO ONE POSSIBILITY IS. A LITTLE HERE SEXTAPE EVER COMMIT JUST PROGRAM WHERE FOLKS WORKING WITH. CHP INSECT BICU THE TO HAVE RECRUITS THE PIPELINE THAT THAT'S ONE WAY FOR MAYBE JOB INTERNS ARE TO COME ON BOARD BUT. TO EACH EVENTUALLY A FULL TIME FOLKS BUT THAT TO ME THE PROBLEM IS. GETTING SOME RETIRED FOLKS IN THERE AND OBVIOUSLY IF YOU'RE NOT PAYING SOME OF RETIRED THE COURT LIMIT NOT NUMBER OF HOURS MISSION UP IN SALARY AND BENEFITS SO. FESCUE SOME WAY TO MATCH THAT AND AND ACTUALLY NAM FIGURED OUT. THE NEXT INTERVIEWS. FOR A LOT OF AGENCIES IT IS MANDATORY PART OF HIM LEAVING THE HAVE IF THE INTERVIEW. THEY CAN REVIEW IF REFUSE TO TALK TO YOU BUT MOST FOLKS WERE TALKING TO A WITH THE ISSUES ARE SO. THAT'S TO BE THAT IS THE POLICY. BEFORE YOU GET YOUR LAST CHECK BEFORE YOU LEAVE ATTORNEY EQUIPMENT AND YOU WILL HAVE AN EXIT INTERVIEW. I THOUGHT IT WAS INTERESTING WITH THE READING THE INSURERS. THAT THAT DO MORE CASES. BUT THAT THAT'S INTERESTING YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY SOME FOLKS OUT THERE. IN THE MIDDLE TO GET BY BUT THAT THINGS AND COMING UP ON THEM. TO HELP US LOWER OUR RACE BECAUSE FRAUD IS A BIG ISSUE WE SEE A LOT. AND SOME AGENCIES HAVE TAKEN AN OATH ACKERMAN COUNTY THE REASON DEPUTY SHERIFFS. FULL TIME TO INVESTIGATE WORKERS COMP FRAUD CASES TELL BUT THAT NAY DID PUT A DENT IN THAT SO. I THINK IS A LOT TO DO. A LOT TO DIVE INTO YOU WITH THIS BUT. LEGACY EVEN LOT INVESTIGATORS THERE BUT THAT THAT THE VACANCY RATE IS JUST UNACCEPTABLE WITH WITH A RAISE LAST YEAR. CDI HAS DO A BETTER JOB GOING OUT AND IN RECRUITING I INDIVIDUALS OTHER FOLKS ARE OUT THERE LIKE IT'S COMING OUT OF COLLEGE. THAT WANT TO GET INVOLVED AND WANT TO GETTING GAY SO. HOPEFULLY CAN DO SOME INTERNET MENTORSHIP PROGRAM TO TO BRING SOME NEW FOLKS ON. THANKS THANK YOU MISTER COOPER A VOICE OF EXPERIENCE IN TERMS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND. ALL THE VARIOUS SO. OF CAREER PATHS THAT EXIST IN HELD HOW THOSE SYSTEMS WORK. A MISTER GRAYSON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND. THANK YOU FOR YOUR REPORT AYE A. APPRECIATE THE THE THOROUGHNESS OF YOUR REPORT AND HAVING GONE THROUGH IT. BY A AND I STAND TO BE CORRECTED BUT AS WE BEGAN TO PRESENTATION. BY I UNDERSTOOD THAT THERE WAS. STATEMENTS MADE THAT. THERE WAS A QUESTION AS TO THE LEGITIMACY OF THE THE NUMBER OF OR SHALL I SAY THOUGH THE QUESTION TO MAYBE THE LACK OF. REPORTING OF INSURANCE FRAUD. AND HOW THAT. THERE MAY BE INSURANCE FRAUD THAT'S NOT BEING REPORTED. BUT THEN I DON'T RUN AND I SEE ALSO ANA A. A IN A FACT SHEET% WHERE CD I IS SAYING THAT THERE ARE ONLY. ABLE TO DEAL WITH FIVE PERCENT WHICH IS AN ASTRONOMICAL NUMBER. THIS FARCE LOW FIVE PERCENT OF THE CASES THAT ARE ACTUALLY REPORTED. AND THEN. THE JUSTIFICATION FOR THAT IS A LACK OF RESOURCES SO MY QUESTION WOULD BE. VISIT. IS THE FOCUS OVER. RIGHT NOW ON. THAT OF THE NUMBER OF REPORTS OR LACKTHEREOF THAT ARE THAT ARE BEING SUBMITTED OR IS IT RESOURCES AND IF IT IS RESOURCES ISN'T LIMITED TO JUST MANPOWER. OR ARE THERE OTHER TYPES OF RESOURCES THAT THEY FEEL THAT THEY ARE LACKING THAT WOULD HAVE MADE A BETTER. AND THEN AS FAR AS THE FUNDING GOES. WHAT IS THE WHAT WHAT ARE THE FUNDING MECHANISMS BUT IS THERE COST RECOVERY? THAT THAT CAN HELP IN AND THE FUNDING OF A DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS FOR THE DA'S. IN THEIR ABILITY TO BE ABLE TO PROSECUTE. SO. A MINUTE YOU HAVE TO A LOT OF QUESTIONS EVER TRY TO PARSE THROUGH THEM AS AS BEST I CAN IF YOU LOOK AT TABLE. ONE ON PAGE EIGHT IT SHOWS IT'S BROKEN DOWN INTO TWO PARTS THE NUMBER OF CASES IN COURT AND THEN THE ESTIMATED CHARGEABLE FRAUD. SHE CAN SEE THAT OVER TIME THE NUMBER OF CASES ACTUALLY STAYED FAIRLY STABLE BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE AMOUNTS OF CHARGEABLE FRAUD. THAT RIGHT THERE IS TELLING US IF YOU LOOK AT THE INCREASE FROM THE FIRST YEAR ON THE LEFT IT'S TWO HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO. MILLION DOLLARS GOING UP TO. UP TO ALMOST A BILLION DOLLARS IN CHARGEABLE FRAUD ONE OF THE CONVERSATIONS I HAD WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S TOWARDS THE END OF OUR. AT THE END OF THE AUDIT SAID IF WE WERE TO HAVE ONE MORE YEAR THERE THIS DISTRICT ATTORNEY WAS TELLING ME THAT THAT ESTIMATED CHART OF IS NOW OVER A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. SO THAT'S A OF A HUGE COMPONENT. INTO ME IT IT SHOWS A COUPLE THINGS NUMBER ONE CD I IN THE DA'S INVESTIGATORS. ARE TRYING TO MAXIMIZE THE VALUE BEHIND THE CASES THAT THEY'RE GETTING IF YOU LOOK AT PROVIDER FRAUD THEY MEANT A CHARGEABLE FRAUD YOU SEE IT GOES FROM ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION IN THE FIRST YEAR. AND IT'S NOW AT EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION SO AGAIN IT SHOWS THAT THEY'RE PUTTING A FOCUS ON WHERE THE MORE EXPENSIVE FRAUD SOCK. BUT IT CREATES KIND OF A AS A COROLLARY TYPE CONCERN THAT THAT YOU RAISED IS WHAT ABOUT THE FRAUD THAT THEY'RE NOT IDENTIFYING WHAT'S THERE AND THAT'S THE PURPOSE BEHIND THE CHAPTER THAT THAT MIKE DISCUSSED ON WAYS THAT WE CAN DO. THE STATE CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF SURFACING THESE INSTANCES OF THE POTENTIAL FRAUD HOPEFULLY PROVIDER FRAUD WHICH TENDS TO BE THE MORE EXPENSIVE OUT OF ALL THE FRONT. IN TERMS OF RESOURCES CDI TERMS OF ITS WORKERS COMP FRAUD EFFORTS AS WELL AS THE LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ARE PRIMARILY FUNDED BY THAT ANNUAL ASSESSMENT FROM THE FRAUD ASSESSMENT COMMISSION. IS CDI SHARES ABOUT. TWENTY FOUR MILLION OF RECENTLY. AND THEN YOU KNOW WHATEVER THAT THE BALLOTS OF THAT IS GOING OVER TO THAT D. A.'S OFFICES. THE DA'S FOR SUBMITTING THEIR REQUESTS FOR THIS FUNDING DEPENDING ON WHAT YEAR. THE FRONT COMMISSION MAY FUND MOST OF THAT REQUEST. IT MADE FUN YOU KNOW JUST SMALL COMPONENTS OF THAT REQUEST. BUT THE FOR PRIMARY FUND SOURCE FOR THE STATE'S EFFORTS BOTH CDI AND THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IS THIS FRAUD COMMISSION FUNDING. NOT SURE THIS CD I REPRESENTATIVE CAN GO ON A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ABOUT. IT THE FUNDING RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO IT. ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SO FOR OUR. OUR STATE AUDITOR AND HER TEAM IT JUST FOLLOWING UP ON MISTER GRAYSON QUESTION SO EVERYTHING ELSE IS REMAIN STATIC. EXCEPT FOR THE CHARGEABLE FRAUD HAS GONE UP MORE LESS. CORRECT OKAY AND. I DON'T MEAN TO BE DISRESPECTFUL THE UNDERSTAND WHAT CHARGEABLE FRAUD IS WHAT CHARGEABLE WE HAVE A DEFINITION AND REPORT CHARGEABLE FRAUD IS. FRAUD THAT THE DA'S ARE CONFIDENT THEY BELIEVE THEY CAN PROVE THAT THERE WAS FRAUD THAT WAS COMMITTED AND IT CAN RESULT IN INCOME AND CONVICTION SO THERE MAY BE OTHER SUSPECTED BUT THIS IS. THIS TABLE IS REPRESENTING FRAUD THAT D. A.'S FEEL THEY HAVE A VERY STRONG CASE WHERE THEY CAN PROVE. AND CONVICT EITHER THE PROVIDER THE EMPLOYEE WHOEVER THE. THE. PARTY IS THAT. THEY BELIEVE COMMITTED THE FRAUD. SO THEY FEEL VERY CONFIDENT ABOUT THAT AND AND AS MISTER CARLSON INDICATED GONE FROM TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY TWO MILLION TWO BILLION AND I THINK THE POINT YOU MAKE MISTER GRAYSON IS VERY IMPORTANT. AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE LOOKING AT THIS PROCESS AS YOU ASKED US TO DO MISTER CHAIRMAN. HOLISTICALLY FROM UP PREVENTION AND DETECTION BECAUSE IF IF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. DOES SOME ANALYSIS AND LOOKS AT SOME OF THESE INSURERS AND SAYING YOU HAVE OVER A HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION IN PREMIUMS ARE ON AVERAGE YOU KNOW TEN MILLION PER. A AND YOU'RE NOT REFERRING IN THE CASES THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM REASONABLE. SO IF WE IF THE STATE DOES A BETTER JOB AS FAR AS A DEPARTMENT INSURANCE REQUIRING INSURERS TO REALLY TAKE THESE. NOW REQUIREMENTS IN STATE LAW TO HAPPY SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE UNITS AND RE FIRST SUSPECTED FRAUD TO INSURANCE. INSURANCE NEEDS TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE THAT SUSPECTED FRAUD. AND THAT'S WHY WHEN WE LOOKED AT DEPARTMENT INSURANCE AND WE SAID THEY KNOW THEY HAVE A HIGH VACANCY RATE THEY HAVE LOST INDIVIDUALS WE DID AN ANALYSIS AND REPORT WHERE. THEIR SALARY LEVELS WERE NOT COMPARABLE TO THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE OUGHT DEPARTMENT CORRECTION SO THOSE INDIVIDUALS LOOKING FOR UPWARD MOBILITY I'M GONNA LEAVE THE DEPARTMENT SHARON'S I'M GONNA GO OVER TO. OTHER DEPARTMENT JUSTICE I WILL BE AN INVESTIGATOR OF ADVANCEMENT OPPORTUNITIES I WILL BE MAKING MORE MONEY NOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT OUR STATE EMPLOYEES TO DO. SO INSURANCE NEEDS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ANALYZING THEIR SALARIES AND THEY CAN BE AS COMPETITIVE AS POSSIBLE. AS FAR AS RECRUITING I THINK THE POINT MISTER HARPER YOU MADE WORKING WITH THE CSU SYSTEM IN BRINGING AND STUDENTS IS GREAT BUT LET'S PARTNER THOSE STUDENTS WITH EXPERIENCE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO. EITHER JOINT STATE SERVICE BECAUSE THEY RETIRED FROM A DIFFERENT SYSTEM OR THEY WANT TO COME BACK AS A RETIRED IN NEWTON AND THEY'RE TEACHING THE PEOPLE WHO ARE COMING OUT OF SAX STATE ARE YOU SEE OR. KNOW COMMUNICANT WHERE EVER. THAT HAVE CHOSEN. STATE SERVICE AS A CAREER THEN WE'RE TRAINING THOSE FOLKS SO WHERE ADDRESSING THE DIFF WORKER'S COMP FRAUD HOLISTICALLY AS A STATE AS FAR AS. INDUSTRIAL ASIANS DOING THE ANALYTICS OUGHT TO PROVIDE INFORMATION AND LOOKING FOR. ANOMALIES INSTEAD OF HAVING TO DEAL WITH HUNDREDS AND HUNDREDS OF. OF CLAIMS AND FIGURING OUT HOW MANY PROVIDERS ARE LOOKING LIKE THEY'RE SERIAL BILLING ARE THERE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS THAT WE WILL HAVE IN THE FUTURE AS A STATE. THROUGH INDUSTRIALIZATION SENATE'S EFFORTS THAT IT CAN HAND OFF TO INSURANCE AND THE DA'S SO ALL OF THESE AGENCIES ARE PARTNERING TOGETHER. TO COMBAT FRAUD BUT IT'S GONNA REQUIRE IMPROVEMENT IN ALL DIFFERENT AREAS AWE AS FAR AS. NOPE THE TOOLS TO PREVENT DETECT LET'S BRING THE RESOURCES AND EITHER THROUGH THE USE IT UC CSU SYSTEM BRING IN THOSE EXPERIENCE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS STRENGTHEN OUR INVESTIGATIVE AND PROSECUTION. AND THEN YOU'RE GOING TO SEE MORE AND MORE DETERRENCE AS FAR AS. WE WE AS A STATE ARE DOING A BETTER JOB OF. IDENTIFYING SUSPECTED FRAUD AND THEN BEING ABLE TO PROSECUTE THAT FRAUD WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL DETERMINE THE VISUALS FROM COMMITTING FRAUD IN THE FUTURE. AND I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU FOR THAT DEEPER EXPLANATION I JUST TO CLOSE BY THAT YOU CHAIR. AND. BY I MADE REFERENCE TO RESOURCES AND THE REFERENCE WAS THAT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF RESOURCES ONLY FIVE PERCENT ARE BEING DEALT WITH. IS THIS THE WORD RESOURCE LIMITED TO JUST MANPOWER OR IS IT BECAUSE. THOUGH THE MANPOWER THAT IS PRESENT THE WORK FORCE THAT IS PRESENT. THEY MAY NOT HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY FEEL THEY NEED THEREFORE GETTING FRUSTRATED THEREFORE THEY GO AND FIND SOME OTHER PLACE TO WORK. I KNOW THAT IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. THERE'S A TOOL THAT I AND I ALSO BROUGHT UP COST RECOVERY SO THERE'S A TOOL THAT FOR CERTAIN CRIMES YOU HAVE ASSET FORFEITURE. FOR IN LARGER CASES OF FRAUD. IS THERE THAT TOOL THAT HELPS COST RECOVERY THAT WOULD PROVIDE THE MEANS FOR THE TECHNOLOGY AND FOR THE TOOLBOX FOR THE WORK FORCE TO BE ABLE TO DO EVEN A BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT JOB. SURE REST RESTITUTION FINES AND PENALTIES THERE'S A VARIETY OF OF LET'S SAY IN INCOME STREAM THAT CAN COME FROM THOSE SOURCES. WE WE SAW THAT THEY WERE THERE WE DID NOT SPEND ANY TIME ANALYZING THAT WE WERE FOCUSING PRIMARILY ON THE ALLOCATIONS THAT CAME THROUGH THE FRONT OF SEISMIC MISTER. AND THE VICE CHAIR MISTER MAYES HAS QUESTION. I JUST FOR CLARIFICATION YOU MIGHT OF. MIGHT A PARTY ADDRESS THIS BUT JUST LOOKING AT THIS A TABLE ONE HERE. LOOKING AT THE TOTAL NUMBER OF CASES IN COURT A RELATIVELY FLAT. FROM THAT THAT THE THREE YEAR PERIOD OF TIME. WELL ALTHOUGH THE CHARGE WILL FRAUD NUMBERS ARE THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE PROVIDER. IS IS THE CAUSE THAT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT. YES PROVIDER FRAUD IS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SF SEASON THOSE AT BAY WAR. INVESTIGATING BECAUSE OF THE LACK RESOURCES WHAT WE DID IS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THEY'RE TRACKING SYSTEM IS IT ALLOWED US TO LOOK AT WHAT TYPE OF FRAUD WAS IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE FRAUD WAS EMPLOYER FRAUD WAS A PROVIDER FRAUD. AND WHAT WE SAW AND THOSE THAT WERE. BUT EMPLOYEE FRAUD THE AVERAGE WAS IN THIS IN IT IN THE FEW THOUSAND RANGE WHEN WE LOOKED AT WHAT THE AVERAGE AMOUNT OF THIS IS ALLEGE FRAUD AS OPPOSED TO THAT CHARGEABLE FRAUD. THE ALLEGE FRAUD ON THE PROVIDER SIDE WAS IN THE SEVENTY THOUSAND PER RANGE SO EACH PROVIDER BASICALLY ON THESE ALLEGATIONS. THAT THE CONCERN IS THAT THEY ARE GOING AFTER BIGGER CHUNKS OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION POT. IT IS THEN SAY AN EMPLOYEE OR PERHAPS EVEN A PROVIDER. SO IT'S SO TO TO ADD TO THAT SO EMPLOYEE COMMITTING FRAUD MAY BE FIVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A PROVIDER MAY BE COMMITTING FRAUD. WITH A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT. INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE RECEIVING CARE FOR THAT FROM THAT PROVIDER SO THE PROVIDER MAY BE COMMITTING TEN MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF FRAUD THAT'S WHY YOU'RE SEEING THE AMOUNT GOING UP AS WE HAVE MORE PROVIDERS. IT'S OF RELATIVELY FLAT AS FAR AS THE NUMBER OF CASES BUT THE VOLUME THE DOLLAR VOLUME FOR A PROVIDER IS MUCH HIGHER THAN A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL EMPLOYEE WHO MAYBE. FRAUDULENTLY CLAIMING CLAIMING A AN INJURY. GOOD ALRIGHT ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS SIR THANK YOU AGAIN FLORA MEMBERS OUTSTANDING ANNA. WORK AND THE. REALLY FINE PRESENTATION TODAY THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE NOW WILL HEAR FROM A. ARE. STANDING.

BEAUTIFUL LET'S SIR THANK YOU AGAIN MISS BAKER AND WE'LL HEAR FROM THE US DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE FOX. PLEASE LET US KNOW YOUR NAMES TO. THIS ARE GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN DALY AND VICE CHAIR MAYES ON THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. THE OTHER STATE AGENCIES THAT ARE HERE. MY NAME IS TO ALLOW CHAIR I'M THE CHIEF DEPUTY FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. I'VE BEEN WITH THE DEPARTMENT FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS. AND MUCH OF THAT TIME IN OUR MARKET CONDUCT AND CONSUMER SERVICES OPERATIONS AS A. HIGHER LEVEL MANAGER AND MOST RECENTLY IN RATE REGULATION. I WANNA SAY FROM MY EXPERIENCE AND MARKET CONDUCT WHERE WE. CONDUCT AUDITS OF. INSURER CLAIMS IN UNDERWRITING ACTIVITIES I I DO APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE. STATE OF FEAR OF AUDIT TEAM. THEIR PROFESSIONALISM WAS REALLY REMARKABLE. AND. THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DISCUSS THEIR FINDINGS AND WORK THROUGH INFORMATION WITH US. pREALLY DESERVES PRAISE SO I THINK YOU TO THE. STATE AUDITOR'S. ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THE EFFORTS OF OUR STAFF WHO SOME OF WHOM ARE WITH US HERE TODAY. OF THE PERSON AT THE TABLE WITH ME HERE IS NOT MIKE LEVY. ART THAT THE GENERAL COUNSEL HE IN MARINE PATROLS OF OUR OUR COORDINATORS FOR THIS EXAM. AND. THEY DID A GREAT JOB FOR US I REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF OUR TEAM. IN THIS REGARD. WE APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEE'S INTEREST FERRY OUT MY BACK TO SOME HERE HERE. NO THE FOR FORMAT HERE BUT. WILL YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR INTEREST AND FIGHTING WORKERS COMP FRAUD. I HOPE YOU UNDERSTAND FROM THE REPORT ALTHOUGH THERE ARE FINDINGS OF NEED FOR IMPROVEMENT THIS IS A CORE FUNCTION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. IT IS SOMETHING WE VERY MUCH FOCUS ON. AT THE COMMISSIONER JONES. TOOK THE FINDINGS OF THE AUDIT VARIOUS SERIOUSLY HE IMMEDIATELY CORRECTED OUR STAFF TO. PUT TOGETHER OUR PLANS FOR A MEETING THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND. AND DISCUSS THOSE WITH OUR MANAGEMENT TEAM. SO. WE'VE SUBMITTED OUR PLANS TOO COMMISSIONER JONES AT THAT TIME. AND SUBSEQUENTLY OF COURSE HAVE RESPONDED WITH ARE OUR SIXTY DAY A UPDATE. TO THAT UPDATE THAT I BELIEVE OUR RESPONSE DEMONSTRATES THAT WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN ADDRESSING THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE AUDITOR'S. AND ARE BEING VERY THOUGHTFUL AND MAKING MEANINGFUL CHANGES TO TO OUR PROCESSES. TO REFLECT OF THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS. WE CONTINUOUSLY SEEK TO ENHANCE THE EFFECTS OF OUR. STATE OUR BAR SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE UNIT EXAMINATIONS. AND ARE HELPING TO DERIVE INSURES FOCUS ON IDENTIFYING AND FIGHTING FRAUD AS WELL. WE CONTINUED TO DIRECT SIGNIFICANT EFFORTS TO OUR RECRUITING AND RETENTION OF QUALIFIED STAFF. AND EXPECT PROGRESS IN THAT REGARD. IT TO IMPROVE DESPITE THE PAY DIFFERENTIALS THAT STILL REMAIN BETWEEN OUR INVEST OF GATOR CLASSIFICATIONS. AND THOSE OF THE DEPARTMENTS OF JUSTICE AND CORRECTIONS AS WAS NOTED IN THE REPORT IN AND. SOME OF YOU DISCUSSED. HERE TODAY. AND WE WORK TO ENSURE THAT THE COORDINATION OF OUR EFFORTS AND THE WORKOF THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S. WHO ARE PARTNERS?% PROCEEDS THROUGH INEFFICIENT AND EFFECTIVE FUNDING PROCESS. SO I'M GONNA TURN IT OVER TO MIKE LEVY TO EXPLAIN. SOME OF THE DETAILS OF IN OUR SIXTY DAY RESPONSE THAT THAT TALKS ABOUT ARE AFTER TO. RESPOND TO THE OTHER THAT ITSELF THINKING MR LOW SURE AND. BEFORE MISTER LEVY. STARTS ARM I THINK WILL BE CURIOUS I WILL BE CURIOUS. ABOUT. THE RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION SITUATION THE PAY CLASSIFICATIONS AND. AND HOW THAT'S GOING. I TALKED TO MR JONES COUPLE YEARS AGO ABOUT IT AND I KNOW THAT THAT WAS AN ISSUE OF A BECAUSE OTHER DEPARTMENTS PAY. BETTER. CLASSIFICATIONS ARE DIFFERENT NAM HE WAS LOSING SOME OF HIS BEST PEOPLE IN A. INVESTIGATIVE AREA. SO TELL US EXACTLY HOW THAT'S GOING IN IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP OUT IN THAT. I KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS A. IS A YEAR. AN ONGOING CHALLENGE. ON MATTERS LIKE THAT BUT IS THERE ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO HELP SO GO AHEAD MISTER LEVY. OR OR. IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT ELISHA CAN COME IN ON ON THAT EFFORT. SO JUST THE RESPOND FROM WHAT. WE'VE HEARD. THE DEPARTMENT DOES RECRUIT. FOR INDIVIDUALS RIGHT OUT OF COLLEGE. WE. TEN JOB FAIRS WE HAVE ASSIGNED TWO OF OUR TOP MANAGEMENT TEAM. TO BE A ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN RECRUITING AT ALL TIMES. SO WE DO A LOT OF COLLEGE RECRUITING BUT WE ALSO DO RECRUIT. AT THE EXPERIENCE LEVEL WE WE DO LOOK FOR OFFICERS COMING OUT OF FOR. SOME OF THE. OTHER AGENCIES LE COUNTY CITY AGENCIES AS WELL AS PEOPLE MOVING THROUGH THE STATE RANKS. A I THINK. RECRUITMENT IS A PROBABLY A DIFFICULT PROCESS FOR ALL SHIRLEY'S AGENCIES AT THIS POINT IN TIME. AND. BEAMS MENTION THAT. WE HAD SIXTY THREE I THINK. VACANCIES THAT WAS MENTIONED WORK NOW AT FIFTY EIGHT SO SOME. LIMITED PROGRESS THERE BUT WE DO HAVE THIRTY ONE POSITIONS RIGHT NOW CANDIDATES IN BACKGROUND. BACKGROUND IS A MAJOR COMPONENT OF HIRING IN LAW ENFORCEMENT. SAY REALLY HELPED THE VET THE INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO. TO DO THE JOB AND. SO WE HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN AND. IN OUR RECRUITMENT EFFORTS WE HAVE MOVED A LOT OF PEOPLE INTO THAT BACKGROUND CHECK AT THIS POINT IN TIME. YOU KNOW WE STILL HAVE THAT. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PAY DIFFERENCE. AND FOR STATE EMPLOYEES YOU KNOW A THREE PERCENT RAISE WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE. BUT. THE DIFFERENT DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN OUR AGENCY AND. OF FOR EXAMPLE A SIMILAR CLASSIFICATION AT THE TOP OF THE RANGE. FOR OUR INVESTIGATOR VERSUS A DOJ SPECIAL SPECIAL AGENT THEY WOULD MAKE CLOSE TO THIRTEEN PERCENT HIGHER PAY. AND ACTUALLY THE NUMBERS ARE EVEN BIGGER FOR. SOME OF THE. COMPARISONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. INCLUDING A JUST FOR THE ENTRY LEVEL. CANDIDATE BUT AT THE TOP OF THE RANGE SO AN EXPERIENCED PERSON AT THE ENTRY LEVEL CLASSIFICATION. THERE BE A THIRTY PLUS DIFFERENTIAL. WITH. A SPECIAL AGENT AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT DRAW OF COURSE TO A STATE EMPLOYEE SHARE THAT'S LOOKING TO UP YOU KNOW AND SERIOUS LEARNING HERE TO ANSWER THAT'S A SERIOUS GAP YEAH. YEAH SO IT IS. IT'S CERTAINLY A WE TOOK INTO ACCOUNT. COMMENTS OF THE STATE AUDITOR'S AND AND ARE LOOKING TO ENHANCE OUR ATTENTION. OF PROCESS. AND WE CONTINUOUSLY TRIED TO UPGRADE OUR RECRUITMENT PROCESS. TO REALLY COMMUNICATE THE BENEFITS OF WORKING FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT. A PERSON CAN MAKE IN TERMS OF. SAVING YOU KNOW MONEY FOR CONSUMERS AND AND AND HELPING PEOPLE. ACROSS THE RANGE OF OUR DIFFERENT FRAUD ACTIVITIES THAT WE DO. CARE SO. IT'S CERTAINLY A FOCAL POINT FORSTER COOPER HAS A FOLLOW UP QUESTION SURE YOU GUYS HAVE STUDENT ASSISTANCE FOR THE INVESTIGATOR. POSITION RECENTLY RETIRED THAT I KNOW THAT. LOVE THE IT FOLKS DO THEIR STUDENTS ISN'T THERE IN COLLEGE TO COLONEL TAKING COMPUTER CLASSES. THEM WITH A GRADUATE BECOME IN THE IN THE PIPELINE FOR THAT WE WILL YOU AND. AND SOME OF THEM. I THINK I MET ONE JUST RECENTLY IN FRESNO THAT'S. COME ONBOARD YET THAT IS SOMETHING WE DO I THINK A BIGGER ISSUE TO ME IN MY MIND AS CHRISTIANS IS DIFFERENT FROM BEING THE THEM INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS. AND THEY SHOULD. KELLY TRY RECENTLY DID A RE ORG. ABOUT ALL THE DIFFERENT IT POSITIONS OF THE HAD OVER A BILL WE ET DE ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH THERE PROBABLY THIRTY OR FORTY DIFFERENT. JOB THAT'S CATIONS UNDER THAT THE ROACHES BICU ONE INVESTIGATOR POSITION THE CITY CALIFORNIA. WITH THE DOJ A. B. C. CONSUMER AFFAIRS JUST ONE. PAY GRADING THAT THAT'S WHAT TO ME IS A BIGGER ISSUE WITH CALLIE CHAR IN THAT THEY CAN DO IT WITH THOSE IT PROGRAMS IN. AND PROGRAMMERS THIS BILL DO THE INVESTIGATOR POSITION TO MAKE IT EQUAL AND FOLKS DO ONE MOVE AROUND VISUALLY IN YOUR BED A. B. C. FOR FEAR THAT YOU ARE COME BACK. AND GO TO. FEEL THE INSURANCE SO I THINK IT IT PREVIOUSLY GOT A. GOOD GALA KELLI CHAR AND IN GETTING INVOLVED THIS NEGATES CLICK SAID IF YOU DO WITH ALL THOSE IT POSITIONS THIS IS A LOT LESS. OF A LIFT WITH HIS INVESTIGATOR POSITIONS. THE CHAIR GOOD HADN'T MADRE POINTS MISTER COOPER AND A. WE CAN NOW. MAYBE WORK ON THE NEXT GOVERNOR. TO HELP OUT WITH THIS ONE. MR CHIU DID YOU HAVE A QUESTION OKAY OKAY GOOD. A MISTER LEVY PLEASE GO AHEAD YES THANK YOU GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN DALY AND. VICE CHAIR MAYES MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THIS MORNING. BOB DIRECTLY RESPONDING TO YOUR QUESTIONS ABOUT RETENTION AND RECRUITMENT AS DEPUTY LASHER SAID. WE ARE WE EXAMINED OUR OUR AYE INTERNAL EFFORTS WE HAVE. ROUTINELY BEEN HIRING AT THE RETIRED LEVEL AND ALSO THE AYE JUNIOR LEVEL IT JUST WASN'T REFLECTED IN OUR. RECRUITMENT PLAN AND NOW IT HAS BEEN REVISED TO EMPHASIZE THAT ASPECTS OF THAT IS BEEN COMPLETED AS. AS MR CARLSON HAS MENTIONED IN TERMS OF OUR RETENTION PLAN THAT WE HAVE. EXAMINED BEST PRACTICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE ALSO EXAMINED OUR DEPARTMENT WIDE. READ RETENTION EFFORTS AND WE ARE REASSESSING HOW WE USE OUR EXIT INTERVIEWS. TO CREATE A FORMALIZED PROCESS THERE'S AN INTERNAL DRAFT THAT IS READY TO BE CIRCULATED IN A FEW WEEKS AND WE HOPE TO HAVE THE ENTIRE RETENTION RECRUITMENT PLAN. EXCUSE ME RETENTION PLAN IN PLACE BY JUNE FIRST. SO WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WILL PROCEED. GOOD GOOD IN THAT SQUARES WITH WHAT TO MISS HOUSE TEAM SAID EARLIER ABOUT THE JUNE FIRST A. A GOAL GOOD I THINK ALL THIS HR TAKA HAS DRIVEN AWAY MY COMMITTEE MEMBERS THOUGHT ABOUT. BUT THE NEVER THE LESS IT'S IMPORTANT WE ALL YOU KNOW THE HR. THE ALL THE HR DETAILS REALLY REALLY MATTER ESPECIALLY IN WITH THESE COMPLICATED TO THE CHALLENGES. ROOTING OUT FRAUD AND SO FORTH. IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE I DON'T HAVE ANY MORE QUESTIONS AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE ANYTHING ELSE YOU WANT TO ADD. ALRIGHT WELL LET'S THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR OF. TWO ARE OUTSTANDING STATE. ADMINISTRATIVE EMPLOYEES THANK YOU. SO HERE FROM STEAK FROM SOME STAKEHOLDERS NOW. WE'VE GOT TO WORKER AN EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVES NEXT ON OUR AGENDA. CHRISTINE BAUMER. THE CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS. JASON SCHMELZER FROM THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION JASON ARE YOU. THERE IS THERE'S MISTER SCHMELZER. AND IN LARA CURTIS FROM THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. HOW BOUT OF? FIVE MINUTES EACH IF I'M I'M I'M SURE YOU CAN MAKE YOUR POINT SIR. IN THAT TIME FRAME. I HOPE YOU CAN'T. I DO MY BEST MISS BOMA GO AHEAD MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. MEMBER. OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS A CHRISTY BALBOA I'M HERE OF THE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA OFFICIAL FIREFIGHTERS IS YOU KNOW REPRESENT THIRTY THOUSAND RANK AND FILE FIREFIGHTERS. IN CALIFORNIA WORKING IT FOR THE STATE CITIES COUNTY SPECIAL DISTRICTS TOOK POWERS AGENCY. AT MY MEMBERS AS YOU KNOW EACH DAY. THEY REPORT TO WORK KNOWING. THAT THEY'RE GONNA SUFFER MULTIPLE SIGNIFICANT EXTENSIVE INJURIES ON THE JOB. HIM THE COURSE THERE PER CAREERS AND PROTECTING THE PUBLIC I DO THIS QUICKLY WHEN I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY. TO THE AUDITOR'S FINDINGS OF I ALSO WANNA THANK YOU FOR SEEKING THIS INFORMATION AND ALWAYS ASKING THOUGHTFUL QUESTIONS ABOUT. HOW TO DETERMINE AND FIND SOLUTIONS? I ALSO WONDER JUST AS OF PERSONAL PRIVILEGE THANK THE AUDITOR AND ALSO THE AGENCIES REPRESENTED HERE TODAY YOU KNOW I THE OPPORTUNITY WORK WITH THEM ON A REGULAR BASIS. AND THEY MAKE IT THEIR MISSION TO CARE FOR MY MEMBERS AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE SYSTEM OF WORKERS COMPENSATION TO TREAT THEIR NEEDS. AND THEN ONE MORE DISCLAIMER AND I'LL GET TO THE SUBSTANCE WHICH IS. I WANTED IS GIVE SOME ALSO SOME CONTEXT BECAUSE WE HAVE PRACTITIONERS IN THE SYSTEM HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS INSURERS ADVOCATES. A ALSO WHO PROVIDE CRITICAL SUPPORT TO MY MEMBERS WHEN THEY'RE TRYING TO SEEK A REMEDY FOR THEIR ENTERED INJURIES AND SO I DO HOPE THAT MY COMMENTS. ON ISOLATED A ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE FOCUSED ON. I DON'T CAST A SHADOW ON THE DEDICATION OF THESE PROFESSIONALS IN OUR SYSTEM. SO UP WHAT STOOD OUT FOR ME DRAMATICALLY WAS THIS REFERRAL ISSUE AND. AND WE HAVE. WE HAVE WE'VE MOVED FROM THE LABOR COMMUNITYHAVE ALLEGED THAT MAYBE OUR INSURERS SOME OF THEM DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SKIN IN THE GAME AND TRYING TO PREVENT. OF THE FRAUD THAT'S BEING PERPETRATED TO THE SYSTEM. AND SO THE REFERRAL THERE SOME CASE ABSENCE THERE OF SEEMS LIKE SOMETHING TO TAKE A LOOK AT. THERE I ALSO WANNA MAYBE MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THE ALARMING NUMBERS. UP REGARD THE COST OF FRAUD AND WHAT MOST OF THE FRAUD EXISTS WHEN YOU OF PUT IT OF COST BASIS. BUT THERE'S ALWAYS A LOT OF FOCUS WE FEEL LIKE ON CLIMATE FRAUD BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBERS. NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE MONEY THAT'S GOING OUT THE DOOR A NOT TO INJURED WORKERS ABOUT TWO. PROTECT EMPLOYERS PAYROLLS IS TO FRAUDULENT ACTIVITIES NOT RELATED TO INJURED WORKERS. AND THEN I JUST WANNA MAKE SOME GENERAL COMMENTS ABOUT FUTURE DISCUSSIONS. A AND URGE MY FRIENDS WHO MAYBE OVER IN THIS AUDIT AND THE FROM THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY THAT THEY WORK JUST AS HARD AND COMMIT THE SAME LEVEL OF EFFORT. TO FINDING PREVENT RATIFICATION PROVIDER FRAUD AS THEY DO. SOMETIMES MY MEMBERS FEEL IN EXAMINING AND REEXAMINING AND DELAYING AND DENYING TREATMENT. BECAUSE WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MY MEMBERS AS THEY LOVE THEIR JOB THEY WANT TO GET BACK TO IT THEY WATCH THEIR EMPLOYERS SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BACK FILLING THEIR POSITIONS WHILE THEY'RE WAITING. TO BE TAKEN CARE OF IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. UP SO WE THINK THE POSITIVE IMPACT OF THAT KIND OF LEVEL EQUAL LEVEL OF EFFORT WOULD BE DRAMATIC ON THE SYSTEM. I DO STILL HERE WEEKLY FROM MY MEMBERS ABOUT DELAYS THEIR FRUSTRATION OVER ACCESS TO PROVIDERS. OR. OVERALL FAILURE TO RECEIVE TIMELY ACCESS TO CARE. A. AND IT SEEMS THAT THE FINALLY THIS THE STUDY SUPPORTS MORE INSURERS PRIMER SKIN IN THE GAME AS I MENTION. BUT ONE OTHER ITEM MAYBE THIS IS JUST. OF FRUSTRATION OF THE CPF THAT IT SOMETIMES SEEMS THAT EVEN WHEN. WE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS INSURER OR PROVIDE NOT MEASURE OF PROVIDER FRAUD OR PREMIUM FRAUD. THE PAST AND SOMETIMES FUTURE EFFORTS HAVE INCLUDED. SOLUTIONS THAT JUST CREATE MORE BARRIERS TO INJURED WORKERS. IN AN ATTEMPT TO GET AT THE FRAUD SO WE. WE HAVE WE ARE AT THE TABLE RIVER REMAIN AT THE TABLE WE WE THINK THAT THE PROCESSES SHOULD BECOME MORE COMPLICATED FOR INJURED WORKERS IN ORDER TO THE. TO ERADICATE THIS FRAUD IN THE OTHER PARTS OF THE SYSTEM. A AND FINALLY. OF THE DEPARTMENT IS REGULARLY PUBLISHED REALLY HELPFUL INFORMATION ABOUT THE DRAMATIC AND SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS. OF THAT HAVE ACCRUED. AS A RESULT OF RECENT REFORM LEGISLATION PASSED BY THIS BODY AND THE VERY EFFECTIVE ANTI FRAUD EFFORTS OF THOSE AGENCIES BUT IT'S UNCLEAR TO ME HOW THOSE SAVINGS ARE BEING PLOWED BACK INTO THE SYSTEM. TO MAKE IT MORE EFFICIENT FOR INJURED WORKERS AND LESS COSTLY FOR EMPLOYERS. WE STAND READY ALONG WITH THE BROADER LABOR COMMUNITY. TO WORK WITH YOU TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A COST EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR EMPLOYERS. AND EFFECTIVE SYSTEM FOR INJURED WORKERS AND THANKS AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU MISS BEAUMONT BOMB REALLY EXCELLENT POINTS AND WELL TAKEN VERY GOOD POINTS. A POLICE CA. MISTERS SCHMELZER OR. LET'S HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNI CHAMBER COMMERCE GOING MORNING MY NAME'S FLOOR CURTIS NAME HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER COMMERCE WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME TODAY. AND REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS IN THIS ARENA I'M OUR MEMBERS RECOGNIZE AND APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS ON ONLY OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT ALSO OF THE LABOR AGENCY THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP RECTIFY WORKERS' COMPENSATION FRAUD AS SEATED IN THE AUDIT. DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS ESTIMATES THAT WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS BECAUSE STATE EMPLOYERS WHO PAY FOR THE SYSTEM THROUGH INSURANCE AND SELF INSURANCE POLICIES TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS FOR CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS MUST GO DOWN IN ORDER FOR CALIFORNIA TO BECOME COMPETITIVE WITH EMPLOYER COST IN OTHER STATES FRAUD PREVENTION WILL ASSIST IN RECTIFYING THIS COSTS FOR EMPLOYERS BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF WORKERS COMPENSATION FRAUD. AS STATED IN THE AUDIT IS AN ESTIMATED ONE TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY BY REDUCING FRAUD WE DIRECTLY REDUCE EMPLOYER COST SUCH FRAUD NOT ONLY INCREASES COSTS CALIFORNIA PLAYERS IT ALSO AFFECTS THE INJURED WORKER. BY EXPOSING THEM TO COST AS WELL AS RISK THEREFORE WE SHOULD CONTINUE IN THESE EFFORTS AND IT SHOULD BE A JOINT EFFORT BECAUSE THE NEGATIVE RAMIFICATIONS ON ALL. WE UNDERSTAND THAT FRAUD PREVENTION IS AN ONGOING ISSUE AND CAL CHAMBERS GREATLY APPRECIATES EVERYONE'S EFFORTS BECAUSE ULTIMATELY OUR GOAL IS A BALANCE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM THAT EFFICIENTLY PROVIDES TIMELY AND FAIR BENEFITS TO THE INJURED WORKER. WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE COST TO THE EMPLOYERS AND THAT'S WHY WERE GREATLY APPRECIATIVE OF THE EFFORTS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MISTER TERRIER EFFORTS IN THIS ARENA THINK SO MUCH. OF GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENDANCE TODAY. MR SMELLS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAVE MY NAME'S JASON SMELTER IN HERE IN HALF THE CALIFORNIA COALITION ON WORKERS COMPENSATION TODAY I WON'T. LAST FIVE MINUTES IN HEREBY THERE'S LIKE A GENETIC PREDISPOSITION I THINK ON THE ON THE PART OF LOBBYIST TO ONLY SPEAK FOR TWO MINUTES I WENT CITY OF THE STATE WILL SO I'LL PROBABLY KEEP IT ROUGHLY THAT AND WE LIKE THAT TOO BUT I I KNOW I KNOW YOU. APPRECIATE. OKAY SO CCW SEIZE OBVIOUSLY STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS THAT I THINK WE REALLY TRY TO. FOCUS ON TWO THINGS OUT ONE GOOD BENEFITS FOR. INJURED WORKERS INTO FAIRNESS AND. KIND OF EFFICIENCY. FOR. EMPLOYERS AND THAT'S WHERE OUR FOCUS IS I DO WANT TO ASSOCIATE MYSELF WITH COMMENT SPECIFICALLY I MADE BY MISS BOMA. ABOUT. RESPECTING WITH THE AUDITOR'S DONE. THE DEPARTMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY NOT LETTING ANY SPECIFIC COMMENTS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL PROVIDERS COLOR OF THE BROADER. PROVIDER COMMUNITY THIS VERY ASTUTE OBSERVATIONS. THE SYSTEM WIDE COSTS ASSIGNED TWENTY FIFTEEN FOR WORKERS COMP AND HEALTH CORNEA WERE AROUND TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT'S A THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY IF YOU JUST THINK ABOUT IT. AND AND THE AUDITOR. IN THEIR REPORT AND SOME OF THE ASSOCIATED DOCUMENTS MADE A VERY GOOD POINT. AND THAT WAS IN PART BECAUSE OF ITS SIZE AND COMPLEXITY TO CALIFORNIA'S WORKER'S COMPENSATION SYSTEM CREATES AMPLE OPPORTUNITY FOR FRAUD. THIS MAY SOUND FAMILIAR IF YOU'VE BEEN IN THIS COMMITTEE A LONG TIME A LOT OF THE TIME WE COME IN HERE IS EMPLOYERS AND LABOR I THINK AND SAY. YOU KNOW. SHOOT FOR CONSISTENCY UNIFORMITY AND OBJECTIVITY LETS TRY TO KEEP THE SYSTEM AS SIMPLE AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF THE LABOR CODE AND THE RULES THAT DICTATE WORKERS COMPENSATION I AND THAT VERY THIN PAPER THAT WE ALL DEAL WITH. IS ABOUT THAT THICK. WHEN I FIRST STARTED IN WORKERS COMP IN NINETEEN NINETY NINE OR SO IT WAS OF ABOUT THAT BECAUSE ABOUT HALF OF IT. I'M SO THIS REALLY IS A VERY COMPLEX HARD TO UNDERSTAND A SYSTEM OF BENEFIT DELIVERY. OF THE CREATES LOTS OF NOOKS AND CRANNIES AND WHICH PEOPLE CAN HIDE AND JUST. SHEER A DOLLAR OFF THE TOP HERE A DOLLAR OFF THE TOP THERE AND IF YOU DO THAT A COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND TIMES ARE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE SOME REAL MONEY. AS TO KEEPING THE SYSTEM SIMPLE UNIFORM. AN OBJECTIVE TO US IS ALWAYS A KEY POINT WE'RE GLAD THAT THE AUDITOR PICKED UP ON THAT. IN THEIR REPORT. AND TO THE POINT CHRISTIE MADE EARLIER. THERE ARE REALLY THREE CATEGORIES OF FRAUD THAT WE SEE A MEDICAL PROVIDER FRAUD OR PROVIDER FRAUD IN GENERAL DOESN'T BE PROVIDER COULD BE COPY SERVICE COULD BE ANY NUMBER OF THANKS. PREMIUM FRAUD BY EMPLOYERS AND THEN. AS OBSERVED BY CHRISTIE UMP THAT THE SMALLEST CATEGORY I AND I THINK THE CATEGORY WE LIKE TO SPEND THE LEAST AMOUNT OF TIME ON. IS. FRAUD BY INJURED WORKERS. LARA POINTED OUT ONE THREE BILLION DOLLARS A AND FRAUD IN THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM A PRE YEAR AND WHERE THIS GETS FRUSTRATING UNTHINKABLE EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. IS THAT WE HAVE SPENT. IMMEASURABLE HOURS IN THIS COMMITTEE ARGUING OVER WAY LESS MONEY FOR INJURED WORKERS. SO IT'S VERY PERSONAL. TO THE PEOPLE WHO EMPLOY WORKERS IN THE STATE AND THE PEOPLE WHO REPRESENT WORKERS IN THE STATE WE'RE ARGUING OVER THOSE THAT AMOUNT OF MONEY. AND WHILE PEOPLE ARE KIND OF* NILLY JUST OUT THERE STEALING IT FROM US. SO WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB WITH FRAUD A NOT. TO SAVE MY MEMBERS A BUNCH OF MONEY AT THAT FRANKLY TO THE POINT CHRISTY WAS MAKING SO WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE ARGUING WITH EACH OTHER. OVER THE ADEQUACY OF BENEFITS FOR INJURED WORKERS. I DO WANNA TOUCH ON ONE RECOMMENDATION. BACK ON. BUT THE AUTHOR MADE MIKE UP TO LIKE I CAN READ ABOUT THEM. THAT THE AUDITOR MADE WITH RESPECT TO. UB'S I'M IN AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S. MAY BE SOME CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT THE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATION WAS. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S NOT AND YOU BE TO EVER INJURED WORKER ON EVERY. SERVICE TO WORK YOU KNOW THAT THEY'RE NOT GONNA GET A FLOOD OF THESE THINGSAND EMAILS THAT THERE IS A DESCRIPTION OF AB QUARTERLY STATEMENTS. WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS BUT THAT'S GENERALLY AS AN IDEA I I THINK THERE IS A COST OBVIOUSLY FOR PROVIDING THESE. THESE NOTICES. BUT I THINK GENERALLY SPEAKING WE'RE NOT SURE THAT IT WILL DO MUCH GOOD FOR INJURED WORKERS TO RECEIVE THE INFORMATION I I SPENT SIX YEARS ADMINISTERING WORKERS COMP CLAIMS AND I'VE SPENT FOURTEEN YEARS. LOBBYING WORKERS COMP CLAIMS AND I CAN TELL YOU WHEN I LOOK AT SOME OF THESE BILLING CODES AND BUILDING PRACTICES AND THAT'S TECHNICAL INFORMATION. MY HEAD STILL SWIMS. WE SAID AND IF WE IF I WERE TO PRINT FOR YOU ALL OF THE NOTICE THAT THAT ARE SENT TO AN INJURED WORKER. THROUGHOUT THE CLAIM FOR INDEMNITY CLAIM IT WOULD BE ABOUT THAT THICK. SO THEY ARE GETTING A LOT OF MAIL FROM US. MINUTES IMPORTANT MAIL IT'S MALE THE TALKS ABOUT. WHEN THEIR BENEFITS ARE STARTING AND STOPPING. APES MAIL THAT TALKS ABOUT WHAT MEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE BEING APPROVED IN BUT MEDICAL TREATMENTS ARE BEING DELAYED DENIED IT STUFF THAT WE REALLY NEED. THE INJURED WORKER TO READ SO THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT IS GOING ON IN THEIR CLAIM. I THINK FROM THE EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE WE WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT SENDING THEM A WHOLE FLOOD OF INFORMATION THAT CAUSES THEM TO SEE AN ENVELOPE WITH OUR NAME ON IT. AND THEN THROW IT AWAY BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO READ IT. PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE WE NEED THEM TO OPEN OUR MAIL AND WE NEED THEM TO TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT IN THEIR CLAIM. EH IT IMPROVES JUST THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE SYSTEM OVERALL AND AND SELFISHLY FOR EMPLOYERS IT HELPS AVOID LITIGATION THAT IS ALMOST ALWAYS A COST DRIVER IN THE SYSTEM. SO WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THERE MIGHT BE SOME BENEFIT THERE IN SOME SITUATIONS I THINK WE PREFER TO LEAVE. THE STATUS QUO WHICH IS A LOT OF CLAIMS OFFICES RIGHT NOW ALREADY DO THIS ON A TARGETED BASIS. WHERE THERE'S A PROVIDER? OR AN AREA OF MEDICAL TREATMENT OR SERVICES WHERE WE KNOW THERE TO BE PROBLEMS. SO. I I THINK STATUS QUO'S OKAY. WOULD BE EXTENSIVE TALKS TO HOW WE CAN DO BETTER OBVIOUSLY OF BUT WE DO HAVE THIS FEDERAL CONCERNED ABOUT. KIND OF FLOODING INJURED WORKERS WITH A INFORMATION. I OF THOSE ARE VERY INTERESTING POINTS AND I'M GONNA ASK. OUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU ON SOME OF THE EXAMPLES. WHAT PROMPTS THE SENDING OF THOSE NOTICES IN SOME CASES? BY SOME COMPANIES JR. AND DOM. NEVER. MORE MAIL AND MORE COMMUNICATION DOESN'T ALWAYS. RESULT IN BETTER COMMUNICATION OR. AND SO THAT'S OF A GREAT POINT AND I DON'T KNOW ENOUGH ABOUT THE VOLUME OF MAIL IN THE TYPES OF MAIL. THE LEGAL THE LEGALLY REQUIRED NOTICES TO KNOW HOW TO FOLD VOTES COMMUNICATIONS INTO THE COMMUNICATION THAT MISSILE WAS RECOMMENDING SO ALL S. MARK AND PAUL TO FOLLOW UP ON THAT MAYBE THERE'S A SWEET SPOT THERE THAT WE CAN. WE CAN NOW CERTAINLY LEARN ABOUT. AND PURSUE YES OF THANK YOU ABSOLUTELY WERE ANY WORSE STILL A EVEN AS THE AS AN ASSOCIATION RIGHT NOW LOOKING AT THE EXISTING NOTICES AND ASKING OURSELVES. HOW CAN WE REDUCE WHAT'S ALREADY GOING TO HELP WORKERS BECAUSE WE WANT THEM TO RECEIVE WHAT THEY THE I HEARD OF WHICH WE NEED TO HAVE YEAH I UNDERSTAND IT OUT OF ME TO RESPOND TO IT VIA? WITHOUT AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE COCA VISION MY POINT SO HAPPY TO ADDRESS ANY QUESTIONS FROM. GOOD THANK YOU ANY QUESTIONS FOR A. FOR THE EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE. PANEL THAT WE HAVE. IF NOT THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME TO GIVE US YOUR PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH. ENSURE PERSPECTIVES. OUR NEXT AND THEN WILL HAVE A PROVIDER PERSPECTIVES SIR. TO. TWO SMALL PANEL SIR. HERE. ALTHOUGH THE FIRST SPEAKERS NOT. SMALL HE'S. LARGE. COULDN'T RESIST MAN. YEAH PATH THAT. I COULDN'T RESIST. YEAH. AT THAT. WE HAVE MISTER JEREMY MURS FROM THE AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION IS THE LARGER OF THE TO HEAR. WE'VE DONE IT ALL OF THE TWO TALLER AND ARAFAT. IT. IN THEN MISTER SEGMENT FROM THE PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA. MR MERGE YOU WANT TO GO FIRST. CLEAR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. DAD'S. REPORTER NUMBER SHAKIRA MY NAME IS JEREMY MURS AND I'M THE WESTERN REGION VICE PRESIDENT FOR THE AMERICAN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION. I A AYE A REPRESENTS SOME OF THE LARGEST INSURERS IN CALIFORNIA'S WORKER'S COMPENSATION MARKET. I WANNA THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY ON THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IT'S AN EVERGREEN ISSUE IT'S AN ISSUE THAT. I'M WE CONTINUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS IN THE SYSTEM. AND. BUT I WOULD LIKE THINK THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY ON THE SUBJECT. OF AN AYE AYE DISSOCIATE MYSELF I GUESS WITH A FEW OF THE OF MS BOWMAN'S COMMENT CERTAINLY NOT ALL OF THEM. BUT WE YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FRAUD WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROVIDERS WERE TALKING ABOUT INJURED WORKERS WERE TALKING ABOUT EMPLOYER FRAUD THERE'S ALL SORTS TYPES OF FRAUD. IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT BY AND LARGE ON FOLKS ARE OPERATING IN GOOD FAITH IN THE SYSTEM THIS FRAUD IS DRIVEN BY A VERY SMALL PERCENTAGE SO I THINK SHE MADE A POINTED COMMENT WHICH. NOT TO CAST A DARKNESS ON A PROVIDERS IN GENERAL OR ANYONE ELSE WHO WHEN WE'RE HAVING A FRAUD DISCUSSION. I THINK I'LL JUMP INTO A FIRST SOME OF THE THAT THE BENEFITS THAT THE GOOD THINGS WERE SEEING IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE WE HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN FRAUD AND I THINK FRANKLY. THERE'S BEEN A BIT OF A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE LAST COUPLE YEARS IN THE WAY THAT WE ARE. ADDRESSING FRAUD I'M AS AN INDUSTRY I'M AND FRANKLY AS A SYSTEM. ON THE LEGISLATURE LED BY THIS COMMITTEE. AND LED BY THE SENATE LABOR COMMITTEE. HAVE RECENTLY ENACTED NEW LEGISLATION HAS BEEN MENTIONED TODAY. THAT I THINK CAN AS A POTENTIAL TO STRANGLE A LOT OF THE BIG SYSTEMIC FRAUD ON YOUR TO RECENT BILLS. HAVE PROVIDED YOU GIVE YOU SEE WITH THE TOOLS. TO ADDRESS THIS TYPE OF FRAUD IN ADDITION WE'RE LEVERAGING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PURSUIT OF MEDICARE AND MEDICAID HEALTH FRAUD TO DETECT AND PROSECUTE THOSE INDIVIDUALS. IN A WORKERS COMP SYSTEM MOREOVER I THINK YOUR AUDIT REQUEST IN THE HEARING TODAY SHOWS AN ENCOURAGING FOCUS UPON THIS EACH READING TOO OFTEN IN THE SYSTEM WHEN WE ADDRESS ISSUES. WE TRY AND. WE TRY AND MAKE A PUBLIC POLICY CHANGE AND THEN WE LET IT BE I THINK THAT THIS IS THIS CONTINUED FOCUS IS IMPORTANT AND IT'S GOING TO BE NEEDED. I'M GOING FOR A FOLLOW UP. BUT OF COURSE LEGISLATION. IS ONLY EFFECTIVE AS ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND ENFORCEMENT AND THAT THE ADMINISTRATION TO LEADERSHIP OF SECRETARY LINEAR. I'M DIRECTOR BAKER DIRECTOR PER SOTO AND THEIR STAFFS. HAVE DONE A COMMENDABLE JOB SWIFTLY IMPLEMENTING THE LEGISLATION. AND FRANKLY THE RESULTS BEEN TANGIBLE YOU HEARD THEM CITED TODAY. THE THE NUMBER OF FRAUDULENT PROVIDERS THAT HAVE THEN. PUT OUT OF THE SYSTEM THE NUMBER OF A LEAN STATE ARE GONE AS WELL. I I THINK THAT THOSE EFFORTS NEED TO BE COMMENDED A BUT I THINK GETTING ONTO THE INSURER POINTS HERE. AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT IF WE'RE TRULY GOING ADDRESS SYSTEM FRAUD AND THE NEEDS BY AND FROM ALL STAKEHOLDERS AND WE REPRESENT. TWO THIRDS AND THE WORKERS COMP MARKETPLACES INSURED. AND THAT PUTS US IN THE U. UNIQUE POSITION IDENTIFY FRAUD. I'M WE ADMINISTER THE MOST CLAIMS WE MAKE THE MOST DIRECT VENDOR PAYMENTS. AND COLLECTIVELY WE HAVE THE MOST SYSTEM DATA. AND I THINK WHAT YOU'VE SEEN RECENTLY AND YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT USE THAT I READ ABOUT IN THE AUDIT. AND THE AUDITOR PRESENTED ON THIS FACT AND CERTAINLY CDI IT SPOKEN TO IT THERE'S A RESOURCE LIMITATION. AND SO WE FOCUSED OUR INSURERS OF FOCUSED IS ON. ON QUALITY BIG CASES. CASES THAT CAN BE PROSECUTED. AND AND I THINK AN EXAMPLE THAT IS IT IS A RECENT ONE DOWN AND ORANGE COUNTY WHERE INSURERS ARE THE ONES WHO IDENTIFIED. AMASSED PATTERN OF SUSPICIOUS CUT AND PASTE PAPER WORK FROM A VERY LIMITED NUMBER OF ATTORNEYS. THIS UNCOVERED A MASSIVE. FRAUDULENT SCHEME THEY REFERRED IT OVER TO ON THE ORANGE COUNTY DA WHO TEAMED UP WITH CD EYES INVESTIGATION TEAM. AND THEY FOUND A MASSIVE. WELL ITS WAS A MASSIVE SCHEME BY TEN ATTORNEYS AND A NUMBER OF RUNNERS IN CAPPERS. THIS SCHEME RESULTS IN OVER THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN INSURANCE PAYOUTS AND IT INVOLVED OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND PATIENTS CERTAINLY NOT ALL OF THAT WAS FRAUDULENT. BUT IT DOES SPEAK TO THE SCOPE. OF OF OF HOW BIG THE SCHEMES CAN GET. WITH REGARD TO THE AUDIT ITSELF I THINK FIRST WE SUPPORT. THE INCREASED RESOURCES. CDI INVESTIGATORS. BAIT YOU WE NEED A THEY NEED BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN INVESTIGATORS TILT TO SERVICE THE VOLUME THAT WERE SENDING THE REFERRALS WORSENING. TODAY I'M. MUCH LESS IF WE'RE GOING INCREASE THE VOLUME OF REFERRALS BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY SO WE ARE WE WERE SPOKE WE SUPPORT EFFORTS TO INCREASE THAT FUNDING. WE SUPPORT. THAT THEIR RECOMMENDATION IN THE AUDIT THE TALKED ABOUT A MAKING SURE THAT. THE FUNDS FROM THE FRAUD ASSESSMENT COMMISSION GO TO THIS AND. UP NEXT WE SUPPORT THE IRISH CONTINUED USE OF THAT THE BIG DATA AND ANALYTICS TO DETECT FRAUD. WE COMMEND DR FOR ITS LEADERSHIP IN THIS AREA ALREADY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THEM AS THEY DEVELOP THIS TOOL AND WE CERTAINLY HAVE THE DATA. UNDER THE NEW LEGISLATION AND A RECENT LEGISLATION YOU PASSED WE HAVE TO NOW CREATE SYSTEMS. THE TRAXXAS DATA IN A REPORTABLE FORMAT IN TERMS OF STATE OVER DEALING WITH YOU ARE DEALING WITH. PROVIDER PAYMENTS. AND THE LIKE. I THINK WHERE WE DIFFER IS. HOW EFFECTIVE A POLICY TOOL OF THE THIS LIST OFSHAME THIS REPORT ON INSURERS? THROWING IN AT YOU KNOW HOW MANY REFERRALS THEY MAKE. EIGHT GATES YOU I HEAR FROM MY MEMBERSHIP. SITUATIONS WHERE I'M THEY SPEND TIME RESOURCES. WORKING UP CASES HANDING THEM OVER TO CDI HANDING THEM THOUGH OVER TO DA OR FRANKLY TRYING TO PREVENT PAYMENT FROM WHAT THEY FEEL ARE FRAUDULENT CHARGES. WITH THE WORKERS COMP APPEALS BOARD. IN THESE EFFORTS ARE ARE ARE. I CAN BE FRUSTRATING IN THAT CD I DOES NOT THE RESOURCES TO HANDLE IT ALL WE THAT SITES BEEN STATUS THIS THAT HAS BEEN CITED A LOT TODAY THE FORTY PERCENT. THEY GET TURNED DOWN BECAUSE THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES SO. FOR INSURERS TO CONTINUOUSLY. MAKE THOSE REFERRALS. WHEN THEY ARE THEY'RE EITHER NOT BEING. FOLLOWED UP ON BY INVESTIGATORS AND PROSECUTORS OR YOU HAVE W. CA BE. OF JUDGES WHO ARE FORCING YOU TO GO OUT AND SETTLE A CLAIM THAT YOU THINK IS FRAUDULENT OR PAYMENT THAT YOU THINK IS FRAUDULENT. LEADS INSURERS TO USE RESOURCES ELSEWHERE AND FRANKLY FOCUS ON THE BIG SYSTEMIC FRAUD. ON TO TRY TO GET. BANG FOR THE BUCK. SO THAT'S I YOU KNOW I I I I THINK THAT IF WE JUST GO AFTER INCREASED VOLUME THE QUESTION FOR INSURERS BECOMES OKAY. OUT OF CHRIS OUR VOLUME OF THE REFERRALS WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN BECAUSE AS OF RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T HANDLE THE CURRENT VOLUME. AND THEN I WILL. BRIEFLY COMMENT ON THAT THE E. OBI'S. I I THINK I WOULD. ASSOCIATE MCOMMERCE WITH MR SCHMELZER. AND I WOULD ASSOCIATE. SO MY COMMENTS AT THE DIAZ RESPONSE AUDIO BEES. I'M NOT SURE THAT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE TO A WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM WHERE A BE INJURED WORKERS A WITNESS BUT NOT THE VICTIM AND OTHER TYPE OF HEALTH CARE'S SET UPS. THERE THE PEOPLE THEY HAVE SKIN IN THE GAME RIGHT IN WORKERS COMP THERE'S NO BUT THEY DO NOT PAY FOR. THEY DO NOT PAY FOR THEIR MEDICAL CARE AND SO THEY ARE OFTEN I'M NOT GOING TO BE AWARE OR IS INVESTED. AMEND THAT I THINK THE SECOND POINT IS YOU LOOK AT OFTEN WHERE THIS SYSTEMIC FRAUD IS COMING FROM IT'S COMING FROM SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE DENIED CLAIMS SO THERE ARE. THERE'S A TREATMENT THAT WE ARE AWARE OF SAID THERE'D BE NO YOU'LL BE TO SEND. AND THEN THE SUGGESTION THAT IF WE'RE PERIODICALLY JUST SENDING OUT ANY OB. PERHAPS. TRIGGERS OR THEY HEARD THEIR IDENTIFIERS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO KNOW WHEN FRAUD IS MORE LIKELY AND WE COULD WE COULD SEND THAT OUT BUT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT SYSTEMIC FRAUD YOU GOTTA BE LOOKING FOR PATTERNS. YOU GOTTA BE LOOKING FOR BIG DATA I GUESS THE QUESTION BECOMES HOW WOULD A. AROUND. A EIGHTY PERIODIC YOU'LL BE GOING OUT BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THE ANALYTICS THE WE'RE PUTTING IN PLACE THAT THAT THAT THE SYSTEMS OF DATA THAT WERE TURNING OVER THE DIR AND YOU W. C. ARE WORKING ON I THINK. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT PROVIDER FRAUD IN SOME OF THESE BIG SCHEMES THAT'S GOING TO BE A MUCH MORE EFFECTIVE TOOL ON THEN TO MISTER SMELTERS POINT THROWING OUT ANOTHER NOTICE SO. I'M WITH THAT I WILL CONCLUDE MY TESTIMONY CERTAINLY AVAILABLE FOR ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU FOR COMMENTING ON THE. QUESTION ABOUT REFERRALS OF THE ISSUE OF REFERRALS. I THINK IT'S STILL KIND OF AN OPEN QUESTION. YOUR EXPLANATION. OR AND PERSPECTIVE IS. SOUNDS VERY PLAUSIBLE AND REASONABLE. ON THE OTHER HAND. THIS IS. IT'S A REFERRAL BASED SYSTEM IT'S SO YOU KNOW OF A CLAIMS BASED. SYSTEM OR. IN SO FOR LARGE COMPANIES TO. TWO NOT REFER AT ALL IN SOME YEARS. HIS SARAM IMMINENT IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL AND IT'S IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE. DISPROVING A NEGATIVE I SUPPOSE BUT. IN MY MIND STILL A BIT OF AN OPEN QUESTION IN A. AND WE JUST SAT DISCONNECT TO KEEP FOCUSED ON THAT I THINK IT'S VERY REASONABLE TO BRING IT UP IN THE AUDIT. AND YOUR RESPONSE. ON BEHALF OF THE INSURERS NAM. AS I SAID IS PLAUSIBLE. AND YET. NOT SURE IT ANSWERS IT AN ENTIRELY IN SO LITTLE IN IT WE JUST HAVE TO STAY FOCUSED ON THAT MOISTURE IF I COMMENT. SURE NO I MAY THINK IT'S I THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I THINK IT'S DONE WELL CERTAINLY LOOKING INTO IT ZERO REFERRALS AND AND SOME OF THAT DATA IS IS CERTAINLY EYE OPENING. WHAT I SHOULDA SAID IS THE LACK OF RESOURCES ON THE RECEIVING END IS NOT REALLY TO ME A REASON IT'S LIKE IT'S LIKE? NO LONGER CALLING THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT BECAUSE THE RESPONSE TIMES ARE GOOD ENOUGH. I KNOW IT IS THE IT'S IT'S LIKE WHICH IS IT SO I JUST. PUT THAT OUT THERE FOR THE GOOD OF THE ORDER BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A A. SOME CONCEPTUAL A CONCEPTUAL AREA AND THEN THE ACTUAL REAL. PRACTICAL AREA. SO DID IF THE INSURANCE THE DEPARTMENT OF. THE BEEFS UP ITS INVESTIGATIVE STAFF AND SOLVE SOME OF THOSE ISSUES MAYBE THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE. WILLING TO REFER THOSE MARGINAL CASES. AND CERTAIN THAT IN ORDER REFER YEAH WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO DO SO AND I UNDERSTAND THAT AND AND AND JUST LOOKING AT THE DATA YEAH I I KNOW THAT TALKING MY GUYS IT SEEMS TO BE MORE VAGUE FOCUS ON. OKAY WHAT CASES ARE THE PROSECUTORS WORK WE FOCUS IS ALSO AND IT'S A COST THERE'S ABSOLUTELY BUT NO TO YOUR POINT THOUGH I MEAN CERTAINLY WE WE DO YOU KNOW WHERE THERE IS A REASONABLE SUSPICION WE HAVE THAT OBLIGATION AND CERTAINLY WE. YOU KNOW TO EXTEND OR NOT WE SHOULD BE DOING A BETTER JOB OF REFERRING THOSE YOUR POINTS VERY WELL TAKEN SIR. MISTER COOLEY DID YOU A QUSTION YEAH PLEASURE TO MAKE OBSERVATION THAT. IN THIS AREA THE ONE THING THE INSURERS WILL ALWAYS NEED TO KEEP MINE IS IT'S IN THE. THIS ALL PLAYS OUT THE PUBLIC REALM. PERIODICALLY WE GO TO THE WORKERS COMP CYCLE. AND THEN THAT GETS RESOLVED WE'RE WHERE HOW PEOPLE VIEW THE EQUITIES. TRADITIONALLY I MEAN THIS GOES BACK A LONG LONG TIME. DID THE. THE HIT ON THEINSURERS IS THAT THEY DON'T NECESSARILY PURSUE FRAUD AGGRESSIVELY. BECAUSE YOU'LL GET IT BACK IN THE RATE. SO. I THINK IT IS. BENEFICIAL TO INSURERS TO JUST ALWAYS LOOKING DOWN THE TRAIL TO THESE PUBLIC DEBATES YOU'LL. TO MAKE SURE YOU ARE EXHIBITING AGGRESSIVENESS AND REPORTING. BECAUSE SOMEBODY WILL MODEL WANNA MAKE THAT ASSERTION. I MEAN I CAN THINK BACK FIFTEEN TWENTY YEARS WHEN THAT. SPECTER BECAME EXPRESSED IN REPORTS THAT THEN GET IN THE PUBLIC REALM. A AND IT'S AN EASY HIT TO MAKE BECAUSE IT SORT OF PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE WHATEVER THE LINE OF INSURANCE NEGATIVE STEREOTYPES REGARDING. INSURERS SO I THINK ARE TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN PURSUING REPORTS AND TENDERING THEM IRRESPECTIVE. DOES START PUTTING THE. PRESSURE ON ANOTHER PARTY IN THIS SYSTEM TO BE ACTIVE AND SORT OF SAFEGUARDS INSURANCE. REPUTATION IN THE WHOLE DIALOGUE WHICH DOES PLAY INTO. YOU KNOW THOSE PERIODIC DEBATES WE SELL. YOU SAID IT FAR BETTER THAN I DID MISTER COOLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON. OF MISTER MARTZ IF NOT. MISTER SUTTON GREAT MY NAME IS MARK SEGMENT WITH PROPERTY KATHLEEN SHIRTS ASSOCIATION AMERICA THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FORMERLY KNOWN AS A CIC. I WANT TO THANK THE A CHAIR AND HIS STAFF FOR WHAT HAS BEEN A LONG EFFORT ON FRAUD AND I WANT TO. REMIND SO THAT THAT STAFF KNOWS THAT FRAUD IS NOT ONLY MONETARY COST WE HAD CANNOT COUNT THE NUMBER OF LIVES HAVE BEEN DESTROYED BY INAPPROPRIATE SURGERIES. FOR OTHER ISSUES WHERE THE FRAUD HAS ONLY BENEFITED THE PRIVATE PROVIDED ABOUT THE INJURED WORKER. AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN IN THE CHARTS INDUSTRY IN THAT'S LONGER THAN I'D LIKE TO ADMIT I'VE ALWAYS HEARD MY COMPANIES COMPLAIN ABOUT THE GIFT WRAPPED CASES A GIVEN THE DOI. AND DO AYE DOESN'T DO ANYTHING THAT YOU TALK TO THE DR Y. THEY SAY WELL THAT STUFF YOU GIVEN US IS NOT APPROPRIATE. SO LAST. YEAR WE ACTUALLY SET UP A MEETING WITH THE DO Y. AND THE INSURERS WHICH ACTUALLY ENDED UP IN A THINK A VERY GOOD WORKSHOP. DRIVE BRIDGE THIS GAP. AND SEVERAL THINGS CAME OUT OF IT WHICH I THINK ARE IMPORTANT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE BROUGHT UP IN THE AUDIT. A DEAL I WAS FRUSTRATED BECAUSE THEY HAVE STAFF IN ISSUES. THEY WANT A FIGHT FRAUD THEY WANTED OF THE TOOLS TO DO THAT WE WANT TO SUPPORT THAT. ANOTHER THING THAT CAME UP THAT ACTUALLY SPEAKS TO THE AUDITOR'S COMMENT ON REPORTS OF IS. THEY DON'T WANT US JUST TO SEND THE REPORT BECAUSE OF HIM IN THAT SIXTY DAY PERIOD BECAUSE THEY DON'T IT'S NOT HELPFUL FOR THEM. BICU HAVE TO BE CAREFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MATERIAL YOU'RE GETTING THAT'S GONNA BE IN THIS REPORT IS ACTUALLY REFLECTIVE. OFTENTIMES WHAT IS MORE HELPFUL IN THIS REQUIRES HELP WITH THE DA'S. IS TO GET THE MATERIAL THAT GOES BEYOND MERE SUSPICION BECAUSE OFTENTIMES MAYOR SUSPICIONS INVESTIGATED AND NOTHING HAPPENS YOU DON'T WANT THAT MATERIAL REPORTED BECAUSE THAT'S NOT HELPFUL. BUT WHAT WOULD BE A GOOD WAY TO JUDGE COMPANIES POSSIBLY ON THOSE KINDS OF CASES THAT ARE TAKEN BY THE DA'S ON THAT ARE ACTUALLY PROSECUTED. ONE OF OUR COMPANIES WOULD TO DOESN'T FILE OUT OF PLACES A GLUT CASES BUT THEY'RE VERY ACTIVE FRAUD UNIT. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OTHER CASES RESULT IN CONVICTIONS SO THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE A MORE ACCURATE SYSTEM. ARE WE ALSO STRONGLY SUPPORT THE EFFORTS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF DUSTER RELATIONS ON THE DATA ANALYTICS. WHAT MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW IS THAT IN TWO THOUSAND THREE SOME INSURERS KNEW ABOUT ROBOT AND THE ISSUES OF PACIFIC HOSPITAL BUT BECAUSE THEY ONLY KNOW ABOUT THEIR SCOPE OF THE EXPOSURE IT WAS NOT UNTIL MUCH LATER THAT IT BECAME CLEAR? HOW BROAD THAT THE ISSUE WAS SO I THINK WE THINK THAT THE TOOLS THE DE? IS PUTTING TOGETHER WILL HELP THAT. ONE MORE ISSUE I'D LIKE TO BRING OUT THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP WHICH IS SEVERAL YEARS AGO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY PASSED LEGISLATION TO TRIED SET UP A ROUND TABLE. OF INSURERS AND DO Y. SO WE COULD START TALKING ABOUT TRENDS AND ISSUES AND MAYBE START ANTICIPATING SOME OF THESE ISSUES THAT WERE ST. THAT WORKING GROUP AND WALLETS AND STATURE IT IT'S NEVER BEEN AFFECTED BECAUSE I THINK THE STATUTE ITSELF NEEDS SOME MORE WORK. AND I'D LIKE TO KIND OF ENGAGE IN THAT EFFORT TO. I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY QUESTIONS FOR MISTER SEGMENT. MISS COBB HERO. ACTUALLY I DON'T I DON'T HAVE A QUESTION BUT I THINK THE IDEA OF MEETING. YEAH BUT KIND OF INVESTIGATOR TO INVESTIGATOR IS IS REALLY A. AND IT'S KIND OF ONE OF THOSE I CAN AHEAD OF ME A MOMENT RIGHT IT IT SOMETHING WITH BRYANT THAT. WELL IT IT IS BECAUSE HOW A CASE GETS INVESTIGATED AND WHAT THAT THE DATA THAT THAT THEN GETS TRANSMITTED IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT THINGS FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE. YOU'RE LIKELY THAT TO NOT MEET IN THE MIDDLE SO I KNEW I AM I WANT TO COMMEND THAT AND I ENCOURAGE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE BECAUSE THE BOTTOM LINE IS YOU'RE OUT AFTER THE SAME THING. YOU'RE TRYING TO CATCH. PEOPLE THAT ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT ARE DOING IT IN A WAY THAT THAT IS RIPPING OFF THE SYSTEM AND NOT THE. MONEY'S NOT GOING WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED AGO SO CANNELLA KURDISH APARTMENT TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE MEETINGS I THINK THE FIRST ONE AT LEAST FOR THEIR PART I GOT FROM MY MEMBERS WAS VERY HELPFUL. WELL I I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IT IS AND I WANNA. AMEND THE GROUP FOR MEETING AND HOPE HOPE THAT THAT WILL CONTINUE INDEFINITELY AS AS THEY WORK ON CASES STICK AS A WORK ON THE METRICS OF HOW A CASE SHOULD BE PREPARED. AND THEN YOU END UP WITH ACTUAL A EITHER CONVICTIONS OR UP. REIMBURSEMENTS BACK TO THE SYSTEM THAT'S GOING TO SHOW THEIR THAT THE SYNERGY WITH THAT GROUP SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT IDEA. GOOD THANK YOU. THANKS AGAIN TO OUR IT ENSURE PANEL. NICE JOB. LAST PANEL. IT'S MORNING. ARE FROM THE PROVIDERS WE HAVE MISTER ALBERTA TO RICO FROM THE CALIFORNIA APPLICANTS ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AMY DURBIN FROM THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION. AND STEVE CATHOLICA FROM THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY. WELCOME THANK YOU FOR. YOUR INVOLVEMENT HERE AND WE'LL START WITH MR TO RICO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE. OF FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS ROBERTO TO RECALL APPEARING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA APP CAN TURN ASSOCIATION. ASSOCIATIONS MADE UP OF ABOUT A THOUSAND ATTORNEYS WHO. WORK FOR INJURED WORKERS EVERY DAY IN THE WORKERS COMP SYSTEM IS. YOU FOR TODAY IT'S A IT'S A COMPLICATED COMPLEX SYSTEM. WITH A LOT OF MOVING PIECES OF BECAUSE ALL ALSO PROUD TO WORKERS MORE MATURE WORKS ANY OTHER SONG. ATTORNEY ASSOCIATION THE STATE PROBABLY THE COUNTRY. AND WERE AFFILIATED WITH THE TEAMSTERS NAM ADDS ONE HIGHLIGHT A FEW POINTS OF FROM THE AUDIT. FIRST AND FOREMOST THE AUDITOR HAS BEEN AS A BEEN STATED TURN NUMEROUS TIMES TODAY'S FOUND AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS IN NUMB PROSECUTED. FRAUD CLAIMS ONLY TWO PERCENT OF THOSE CAN BE. ATTRIBUTED TO FRAUD BY WORKERS I THINK DATA. IN MY EXPERIENCE ANYWAY IT IT REALLY CONTRADICTS THE THE POPULAR STEREOTYPE DATA THE SYSTEM IS BEREFT OF. AND I NOW FRAUGHT WITH SO WORKERS FRAUD. GO THAT'S THE ART OF FIND THE DEATH THAT THE CASE NOW SECOND. AS A BEEN NOTED REPEATEDLY NOW WE MAY HAVE A CHALLENGE WHEN IT COMES TO THE REPORTING OF FRAUD FROM INSURANCE COMPANIES I'M I'M NOT HERE TO DEBATE THE. THE MOTIVE FOR THE ORDER RATIONALE I ONLY WANT TO NOTE THAT. IN THE AUDIT. THE COMMITTEE REPORT NOTES THAT STATE LAW CURRENTLY REQUIRES INSURERS TO REFERRED A FEW DE AYE AND DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE ANY CLAIM TO CHILL. REASONABLE EVIDENCE OF FRAUD SO THAT IS REALLY A CURRENT LAW. ISSUE ENFORCEMENT. I'M NOT SURE WHAT THE ANSWER THAT IS MISTER CHAIRMAN IF THERE NEEDS TO BE. SOME. SOME REPERCUSSIONS AROUND PROTECTIONS IF IF CARLOS NOT FOLLOWED BUT I WOULD I WOULD PUT THAT TO THE. THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION FOR FUTURE A POSSIBLE. OUT ON LEGISLATION SECOND AUDIT FOUND IS IS BEEN NOTED REPEATEDLY THAT VACANCIES. ARM CREATING A SHORTCOMINGS IN FOUGHT INVESTIGATIONS AND PROSECUTIONS THERE WERE EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED CASES OF FRAUD CLOSE WITHOUT ANY INVESTIGATION. TWENTY SOME PERCENT OF FUNDS WERE. ALLOCATED WERE NOT USED. I THINK THIS IS A. IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM IS IS TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WERE BATES COULD RETURN TO INSURANCE COMPANIES. ARE THIS IS HAPPEN AT THE SAME TIME AS. LA COUNTY REQUESTED ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR FRAUD PROSECUTION. SENATOR CONNIE WILKERSON MILLION DOLLARS IN YOUR COUNTY MISTER CHAIRMAN ORANGE COUNTY REQUESTED SIX ON A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR IT SEEMS TO ME. THAT THAT MONEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN REALLOCATED TO THE COUNTIES FOR ADDITIONAL PROSECUTION. THIRD. THERE'S BEEN SOME DISCUSSION ABOUT THE EVIDENCE OF BENEFIT STATEMENTS. I DO WANT TO POINT OUT ONE ONE NUGGET OF INFORMATION HAS NOT BEEN. STATED BECAUSE WE THINK THIS THIS IS SOMETHING TO BE EXPLORED ONE OF THE EMPLOYERS THAT WAS INTERVIEWED AS PART OF THE AUDIT. IN FACT FROM YOUR DISTRICT DISNEY LAND. MAKE DO THIS AS A MATTER OF PRACTICE THEY FOUND THAT IT INCREASES TRANSPARENCY IT WOULD MAKE SURE THAT THE WORKERS UNDERSTAND. THE BENEFITS THAT ARE REQUIRED. MAKE SURE THE BOOK OF BETTER UNDERSTAND SYSTEM. AND BATES TOLD THE DAUGHTER BUT THE COST OF OF THESE REPORTS. THE STATEMENT IS FIFTY CENTS. FIFTY CENTS PER STATEMENT YOU KNOW IS THE DROP IN THE BUCKET WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT ONE TO THREE BILLION DOLLARS. IN FRAUD SIGH I ALSO PUT THAT TO THE COMMITTEE'S CONSIDERATION. AND FINALLY. THERE HAS BEEN SOME MENTION OF THE REFORMS. THE RESULTING REFORMS INCREASED IN IT INCREASED IN PERMITS BELIEVE OUTFITS WHICH IS GREAT. ALSO A REDUCTION IN INSURANCE PAYMENTS WHICH IS ALSO. A GOOD OUTCOME HOWEVER. THERE WAS DISCUSSION THAT THERE WAS THERE HAVE BEEN ONGOING ATTEMPT TO REDUCE THE FRICTIONAL COSTS IN THE SYSTEM THE DRIVE. POTENTIALLY COSTS UP. I WE WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS COMMITTEE THAT THAT THE FRICTIONAL COSTS OF IN LARGE PART BEEN TRENT. HAVE BEEN. TRANSLATOR OR. FOR OF PUSHED UPON WORKERS SO WHAT WHAT I MEAN BY THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT DELAYS. IN THE SYSTEM THAT A RESULT OF UTILIZATION REVIEW IN A PANIC A LITTLE KARU VIEW. THAT RESULTED NOT SOMETIMES MONTHS SOMETIMES YEARS OF DELAYS OF GETTING SERVICES FOR THE WORKERS. AND THESE ARE THESE COST THESE ARE COSTS FOR THE WORKERS. ONCE A WORKER RUNS OUT OF TEMPER DISABILITY AFTER TWENTY FOUR MONTHS DEBATE GOT OF INCOME IF THE CASE SEVEN BEEN CLOSED. THE THIS PUTS A SIGNIFICANT BURDEN ON THESE FAMILIES. AND SECOND. I WOULD SAY THAT. THE DELAY ALSO IS IS BORN BY EMPLOYERS. BECAUSE OF EMPLOYERS ARE MISSING WORKERS BECAUSE OF INJURIES IN THE WORKERS CAN GET BACK TO WORK. THOSE PLANS HAVE TO BE BACK FROM SITE I WOULD I WOULD SUBMIT THAT FOR THE CONSIDERATION THE COMMITTEE. THAT THE WHILE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS AN INCREASE IN BENEFITS. THERE ARE ONGOING COSTS AN ONGOING ISSUE FOR WORKERS WHEN IT COMES TO BEING ABLE TO RETURN TO WORK AND EXPEDITIOUS FASHION. WITH THAT MISTER CHAIRMAN I WILL I WANT TO THANK YOU IN THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS MATTER AND. WE WOULD. ENCOURAGE THE COMMITTEE TO. TAKE UP MANY OF THE MANY OF NOT ALL OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WILL NOT AFFECT EXTRA. THANK YOU SIR MISTER URBAN. THINK MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IN LEADER BUT NOT THE CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY HERE AND CONTINUE TO BE PART OF THE DISCUSSION AND ONGOING PROGRESS TO BE CREATES BROUGHT IN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. CMA HAS CONSISTENTLY PARTICIPATED IN STAKEHOLDER EFFORTS TO REDUCE FRAUD AND HOLD APPROPRIATE PARTIES ACCOUNTABLE AND WE THINK THE AUDITOR'S REPORT SUGGESTS REASONABLE WAYS TO FURTHER CURRENT PROCESSES. IT SHOWS MUCH ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT REGARD TO ENFORCEMENT AND HIGHLIGHTS BUT ISSUE AN IMPORTANT WAY. AS WE LOOK AT SOME OF THE BROAD WAYS TO STRENGTHEN PREVENTION DETECTION AND ENFORCEMENT HOWEVER WE MUST PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO DETAILS OF IMPLEMENTATION. FOR INSTANCE THE REPORT RECOMMENDS THAT DR BETTER DOCUMENT AS DATA ANALYTICS EFFORTS TO IDENTIFY PROVIDER FRAUD. WHATEVER WE TALK ABOUT SYSTEMS THAT ALLOW FOR EXAMINATION OF LARGE VOLUMES OF DATA WE HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO APART PIECES OF HOW THAT WORKS HOW SUCH PERSONAL PATIENT MEDICAL INFORMATION IS TO BE EXCHANGED. EXAMINED AND STORED WHAT MEASURES ARE IN PLACETO ENSURE PRIVACY REMAIN SUFFICIENTLY PROTECTED AND THAT ASSESSMENTS AND OUTCOMES BASED UPON THEM ARE FAIR AND EFFECTIVE. THEREFORE WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE FULL AND TRANSPARENT DOCUMENTATION OF TEARS DATA ANALYTICS EFFORTS AND HOW IT IS BEING USED IN WILL BE YEARS AND WOULD ALSO LIKE TO BE PART OF DISCUSS DISCUSSIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS AROUND THESE EFFORTS. ON ARE CRYING EXPLANATION OF BENEFITS STATEMENTS TO INJURED WORKERS SEAMAN'S CONSISTENTLY SUGGESTED THAT WE SHOULD LOOK TO OTHER EXISTING HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES FOR PROCEDURES THAT ARE PUT IN PLACE HERE AS WELL. COULD IMPROVE THE OPERATION OF THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM INCLUDING THE DETECTION OF FRAUD IMPLEMENTATION AND CONSISTENCY REMAINS KEY HOWEVER AND WE AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO OFFER OURSELVES TO THAT DISCUSSION. THE WAY WE LOOK AT FRIDAY IN THE FUNDING TO COMBAT IT SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY BROAD AS WELL. FOR EXAMPLE ON THE REPORT WITHOUT A SYSTEMS TRACKING WORKERS' COMPENSATION FRAUD OFTEN DO NOT ALLOW FOR REAL CLEAR BREAKDOWN OF TYPES OF FRAUD. FOR INSTANCE THAT MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS THAT ARE IN THE SYSTEMIC LEADING COPY SERVICE AS AND OTHERS LIKE THAT. AND ALSO DID INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF HERBAL FRAUD FOR EMPLOYERS. PERHAPS THESE DETAILS BABY MISSING OPPORTUNITIES TO CLARIFY HOW WE TALK ABOUT FRAUD IN THE SYSTEM AND GET MORE FOCUSED EFFECTIVE IN OUR EFFORTS TO COMBAT IT. AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE OUR PERSPECTIVE AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO CONTRIBUTE TO ANTI FRAUD EFFORT SO WE CAN REMAIN FOCUSED ON GETTING INJURED WORKERS ACCESS TO NECESSARY MEDICAL TREATMENT. THINK GOOD THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND MISTER. TALER. GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU CLEAN MEMBERS I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. MY NAME IS STEVE CATHOLICA ON THE DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS OF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF INDUSTRIAL MEDICINE AND SURGERY. AFFILIATES OF THE YEAR AYE IN NATIONAL MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS. I FEEL A LITTLE BIT LIKE CONFIRMED THOSE OF YOU THEY'RE OLD ENOUGH SHOT MEMBER ROCKY AND BULLWINKLE THE. ADD THAT TO WHERE THE ELEPHANT GOES ACROSS THERE'S A GUY COME IN BEHIND HIM. I FEEL A BIT LIKE THAT GUY. BUT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS NOT JUST BECAUSE I'M HAPPEN TO BE LAST ON THE ON THE DAY IS HERE. BUT DIED THERE'S GONNA ARE I THINK IT A DEARTH OF. ATTENTION PAID TO. INFORMATION COMING UP FROM THE BOTTOM. WE CERTAINLY HAVE TALKED AND AND I ASCRIBE TO. MR SECONDS. DISCUSSION ABOUT REPORTING. ARE BY INSURANCE CARRIERS HA I THINK THAT I THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING WHAT THEY CAN I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING WHEN YOU GO THROUGH THE EFFORTS THAT THEY DO. AND ARE FOR WHATEVER REASON THEIR EFFORTS HERE SEEM TO BE IGNORED. BUT I WILL TELL YOU THAT. YOU MULTIPLY THAT BY THE THOUSANDS OF INJURED WORKERS AND HUNDREDS AND THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF UP PROVIDERS WHO COMPLAINED TO THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION TO THEIR AUDIT UNIT. AND OUR OUR NORD. THAT WE WE KNOW THEIR PAIN IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT BUT IT CERTAINLY TOWARDS THE SAME END. HA WITH RESPECT TO THE I'M NOT SPENT RESOURCES. WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY PENNY SHOULD BE SPENT AND I'M GONNA HAVE A SUGGESTION ABOUT THAT IN JUST A FEW MINUTES. ARM AGAIN SPEAKING TO. THE WHAT APPEARS TO BE UNEVEN REPORTING BY INSURANCE CARRIERS I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE TALKED TO MISTER SECONDS ARE MEMBER WHO HAS A TWENTY FIVE PERCENT SUCCESS RATE. NOW INTERNALLY MY GOODNESS FAR MAYBE THAT'S RIGHT. BETTER NOBODY ELSE'S MAN IF I CAN IF I UNDERSTAND THE NUMBERS CORRECTLY. I DATA ANALYTICS. WE'RE. COMPLETELY ONBOARD WITH-USING DATA TO GENERATE APPROPRIATE INFORMATION SO THAT GOOD POLICY DECISIONS CAN BE MADE I DON'T THINK YOU MAKE POLICY DECISIONS ON DATA ALONE. BUT BY THE SAME TOKEN. I THINK THAT WITH RESPECT TO THIS TO THE FRAUD ISSUE. THERE'S SOME EDUCATION OUT OF TAKE PLACE. I THINK THAT THE DIVISION AND A CD I NEED TO PUT IN FRONT OF THE COMMUNITY. THE WHOLE. ARMORY. OF TOOLS THAT THEY HAVE AT THEIR DISPOSAL. AND EDUCATE. THE PARTICIPANTS TO WHAT CAN BE DONE. NOT THE TACTICS NOT THE STRATEGY. BUT WHY SHOULDN'T EVERYBODY BE AWARE OF WHERE THEY'RE LOOKING WHY THEY'RE LOOKING AND WHAT COULD BE THE RESULTS. I THINK THAT THAT DETERRENT WOULD BE IMPORTANT. I LIKE TO OUT. WE GO TO WOULD A DIFFERENT LEVEL OF FRAUD THAT WE BELIEVE IS IS PERVASIVE ACTUALLY MAKE A TWO COMMENTS IN THAT REGARD. OTHER RECENT REVELATION THAT. AT INSURANCE UTILIZATION REVIEW POSITIONS RENDERED OPINIONS BASED ON NURSE RECOMMENDATIONS ONLY WITHOUT INSPECTING THE PATIENT'S MEDICAL RECORDS. HAS LEFT EVERYONE WITH A SHOCK AND DOUBT. WHILE THIS INCIDENT OCCURRED IN THE GROUP HEALTH REALM. WE HAVE EVIDENCE. IN WE BELIEVE THAT THE SAME PRACTICE OCCURS ON A REGULAR BASIS AND CALIFORNIA'S WORKER'S COMPENSATION SYSTEM. THE PROBLEM WITH GATHERING SUCH EVIDENCE IS THE THREAT OF RETRIBUTION BY INSURERS AND YOU ARE COMPANIES WHO MIGHT SINGLE OPPOSITION TO COME FORWARD. TO ASSURE THAT INITIATIVES INTO THIS GO FORWARD AND HAVE A CHANCE OF SUCCESS. WHISTLEBLOWER STATUS MUST BE AFFORDED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. HOW COULD THIS POSSIBLY OCCURRING THE FIRST PLACE? WELL MORE BY THINK IT'S CLEAR. ITS PRODUCTIVITY. MORE THROUGHPUT OF REVIEWS MEANS FEWER MISSED DEADLINES AND HIGHER MARGINS. THE OPPORTUNITY EXISTS BECAUSE THE YOU OUR PROCESS BELIEVES THAT IT CAN HIDE BEHIND EXCLUSIVE REMEDY. IN THE MEANTIME THE COMMUNITY WAITS FOR THE OPINION AND KING VERSUS COMP PARTNERS CASE CURRENTLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT. THAT WILL LIKELY IT LATER REST THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE CARE AND SAFETY OF THE INJURED WORKERS WITH. IRAQ'S. SHE SEEMS IN THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CONSISTENTLY HELD THAT YOU ARE IS THE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE AND PATIENT SHOULD BE ACCORDED A LEVEL OF SAFETY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THREE TIMES HE SEEMS ARE PUT THROUGH LEGISLATION AND WAS NOT OPPOSED. THAT WOULD HAVE REQUIRED YOU ARE PHYSICIANS TO BE LICENSED IN CALIFORNIA. EACH TIME IT WAS VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR THAT WAS SEATED AT THE TIME. WHY? WHAT'S THE FEAR. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT. BUT IT'S CONTRIBUTING TO. THE KIND OF FRAUDULENT ACTIVITY THE DECEPTION THAT TAKES PLACE. WHEN A YOU ARE DECISION IS MADE BY SOMEBODY IT TO DENY. IS MADE BY SOMEBODY BESIDES. A PHYSICIAN. REFERRING BACK TO THE ISSUE WASTE OF RESOURCES WE PROPOSED ANY REMAINING MONEY. SHE ACTUALLY GRANTED TO THE DIVISION OF WORKERS COMPENSATION. OR THEY OUGHT TO SHIFT SOME OF THE MONEY THAT THEY HAVE IN THEIR CURRENT BUDGET. IN ORDER TO MAKE THEIR. AUDIT DEPARTMENT MORE RESPONSIVE I MENTIONED BEFORE. THAT THE. I'M GONNA SAY THOUSANDS OF COMPLAINTS THAT COME FROM INJURED WORKERS IN PHYSICIANS FOR SOME. IF FOR A PAR ON IT THEY CALL IT. EVERY FIVE YEARS. WE BELIEVE THAT ESPECIALLY AUDITS IN THE ISSUE IN ON THE ISSUE THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT UTILIZATION REVIEW. NEED TO BE INVESTIGATED ALMOST IMMEDIATELY WHILE THE INFORMATION IS FRESH. AND THE INFORMATION READILY AVAILABLE. SECOND. IN THIS IS OF A FRAUD THAT'S EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD INSIDIOUS. IT INVOLVES THE DELIVERY OF MANAGED CARE SERVICES TO THIRD PARTIES THE CONTROL PROVIDER PAYMENTS WITHOUT PROPER LICENSURE OR SUPERVISION AND US WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY WHATSOEVER. THE RECENT SETTLEMENT OF A FEDERAL LAWSUIT DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE IS MERELY THE TIP OF AN ICEBERG. IT'S BEEN RAISED ON A NATIONAL ATTENTION. IRONICALLY THAT ATTENTION BEGAN AS EVIDENCE HEARING CALIFORNIA FEW YEARS AGO. WHEN THE RATING BUREAU WAS COMPELLED BY THE COCK CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AND OTHER THAN COMMISSIONER POISONER. TO BEGIN TO REPORT THE COSTS OF COST CONTAINMENT SERVICES SERVICES SUCH AS YOU ARE BILL REVIEW PPO NETWORK FEES. AND THOSE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT ON. TRY GENTLY TAKE MONEY FROM INJURED WORKERS TO PART BELIEVE THEY NEED HELP WITH THEIR. VOCATIONAL AWARDS. THAT YOU LEVEL OF REPORTING RESULTED IN REVELATION THAT SUCH COSTS HAVE BECOME A SIGNIFICANT COST DRIVER. IN THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM. IN THIS BECAUSE THEN THE RISING COST ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO OUR REPORTS FROM THE W. C. I R. BE. THAT THE COST OF CLAIMS ADMINISTRATION TO WHICH THOSE COSTS WERE ASSIGNED. REPRESENT A LARGER PROPORTION OF COSTS THEN EITHER INDEMNITY BENEFITS ARE ACTUAL HANDS ON MEDICAL CARE. AS I WAS MENTIONED ALSO BY MR SECOND THE ROUND TABLE THAT DIE HE DESCRIBED. WE WOULD. LIKE TO CONTINUE IT WOULD WOULD LIKE TO BE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. IN THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS AS SUB MISTER I THINK SCHMELZER DESCRIBED THE OUT LABOR COOKBOOK FROM GOING FROM HERE ROUGHLY AN INCH TO. SEVERAL AND THE FORMAT FROM HIM FOR BY SIX TO A EIGHT BY ELEVEN AND NOW MAYBE. LEDGER SIZE IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THIS THE SITE NONE OF THOSE RIVER REFORMS. OR FOSTER BY THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY. THOSE COMPLICATIONS HAVE CAUSED THE ISSUES THAT CAUSE FRAUD OR ALLOW FRAUD TO. TO PROOFREAD WE BELIEVE. THE MORE COMPLICATED THE SYSTEM IS THE THE EASIER IT IS TO WIGGLE YOUR WAY INTO AND CREATED THIS FOR ONESELF THAT MAY GET HIDDEN. WE THINK THAT A LARGER TABLE WITH MORE DISCUSSION. MORE DELIBERATION. IS THE WAY TO GO ABOUT THIS AND I I RESPECT THE CHAIR SAT A DESIRE TO HAVE OVERSIGHT. I KNOW THAT. ASSEMBLYMAN COOLEY IS IS A AS RULES SHARE IS. PAUL ABOUT OVERSIGHT AND WE HOPE THAT THIS IS THE FIRST OF A SERIES OF OVERSIGHT HEARINGS ON A NUMBER OF OF ISSUES THAT I THINK CAN IMPROVE THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND. I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE NEW IDEAS OR DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON. ON THE NEAR TERM FUTURE HERE THAT ARE UP THERE VERY HELP UNHELPFUL AND THOUGHT PROVOKING AND. APPRECIATED VERY MUCH A DIGITIZER. LARA AT GROUND LEVEL ON. ON THESE ISSUES. COMMITTEE MEMBERS ANY QUESTIONS FOR THIS. PANEL THIS IS OUR LAST GO AHEAD MISS OUT HERE I JUST WANT TO SECOND WHAT YOU YOU JUST SAID IS THAT. IT REALLY THOUGHT PROVOKING YEAH I IDEAS AND I'M LIKE AGREE WITH I THINK MORE PEOPLE AT THE TABLE. COULD HELP US ACHIEVE. A BETTER OUTCOME IN THE END WHICH IS HOW DO WE GET WORKERS INJURED WORKERS BACK ON THEIR FEET AGAIN SO THAT THEY CAN GO BACK TO WORK. AND HOW DO WE. APPROPRIATELY PROVIDE MEDICAL ATTENTION FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO. THAT MORE COMPLICATED THE SYSTEM IS AND IT'S COMPLICATED. AND THE MORE. TWISTS AND TURNS TO IT. AS A WAY TO DETECT FRAUD. THE MORE THAT MORE DIFFICULT BECOMES TO ACTUALLY SEE IT AND SO I'M I'M WITH YOU ON THAT ONE AND. I I GUESS ES UP AS A FINAL PARTING I'M THAT FACT THAT DOWN. CDI CLOSE IS ABOUT FORTY PERCENT OF THE REFERRALS. NOT WITHOUT IN IT WITH OUT AN INVESTIGATION. BECAUSE THEY HAVE INSUFFICIENT. RESOURCES AND IT IS VERY DISTURBING FOR ME BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GETTING TO THE ROOT OF THE ISSUE. AND AND IT MAY BE THAT NONE OF THESE WOULD BE VALIDATED RIGHT BUT WE JUST DON'T KNOW AND SO IN THE MEANTIME. WE'RE REALLY. WE'RE REALLY NOT GETTING TO THE BOTTOM OF WHAT THE PROBLEM IS SEVERE. IF IT'S A BIT DISCOURAGING ISN'T IT CAMP. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FOR OUR LAST PANEL HERE IN NO. I REALLY MEAN IT THOSE ARE SOME EXCELLENT TO SUGGESTIONS AND POINTS THAT YOU ALL MADE AND A VERY HELPFUL TO US AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU VERY VERY MUCH THANK YOU APPRECIATED. ANYTHING ELSE FOR THE HIGHLY ORDER DAY. WERE WERE ON SCHEDULE AND I THINK WE'LL AT WE LEARNED A LOT IN HEARING FROM. THE STAKEHOLDERS. AND ALL THE OTHER PERSPECTIVES AND I AGAIN I WANT TO THANK MS HELL IN HER OUTSTANDING TEAM. FOUR OF THEM FOR DELIVERING THE AUDIT DOES SO WELL. YES MISS COPIER JUST CHECKING TO SEE IF YOU'RE GONNA DO PUBLIC. COMMENT. AND I THINK WE WILL INVITE SIR. COMMENTS ESPECIALLY BECAUSE IT'S IDENTIFIED ON THE AGENDAS THAT'S PROBABLY A GOOD IDEA. YEAH. YEAH AND. LET ME SEE IF THERE ARE ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS AT THIS POINT. THANK YOU AND FOR YOUR. FOR YOUR. THERE YOUR REMINDER ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS. ALRIGHT IF NOT OF THIS HEARING IS ADJOURNED THANK YOU VERY MUCH
