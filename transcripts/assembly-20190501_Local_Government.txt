STANDARD EQUIPMENT -- OKAY GOOD MOVE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB -- FOURTEEN THIRTEEN THIS AFTERNOON -- MEMBERS I THINK YOU KNOW HOW DIVERSE OUR STATE IS AND WE OFTEN HEAR ABOUT THE UNIQUE AND VERY NEEDS A VARIOUS PARTS THE STATE NORTHERN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA CLOSER INLAND COMMUNITIES -- FOR THOSE OF US THAT COME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE KNOW THAT THESE DIFFERENCES EXIST EVEN WITHIN SMALLER JURISDICTIONS THAT WE REPRESENT ESPECIALLY WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES OF TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE -- AS LOCAL JURISDICTIONS PLAN FOR TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS PROGRESS I THINK ALL OF US TO SEE COULD BE STYMIED. WITH THE NEEDS OF ONE COMMUNITY MAY DIFFER FROM THAT OF NEIGHBORING LOCAL COMMUNITY. UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER SIDE REGION REALIZE ANY BENEFIT AND THE CITY AND THE SAME FEELING INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER BE TRANSIT ROAD REPAIR GO WITHOUT IMPROVEMENTS FOR DECADES. AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN SEEKS TO CHANGE THAT BY ALLOWING LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITIES THAT HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADVANCE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS BY SUBREGION SUBREGIONS HAVE SHOWN A DESIRE TO GET PAST THE POLITICAL GRIDLOCK IN AN EFFORT TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR COMMUNITIES. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY EIGHTEEN SEVERAL TRANSPORTATION MEASURES APPEARED ON BALLOTS ACROSS THE STATE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN SIX PASSED IN EIGHT FAILED. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN THREE PASSED INTO FIELD HOWEVER AND THOSE THAT FAILED WE SELL CLEAR EVIDENCE THAT QUARTERS A CONSTITUENCIES TO SUPPORT THE MEASURE. FOR EXAMPLE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING MEASURES IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY IN PLASTER COUNTY CAME WITHIN PERCENTAGE POINTS OF MEETING THE INCREASE DESPITE LARGE CONCENTRATIONS OF SUPPORT. THIS BILL I WANT TO BE CLEAR DOES NOT CHANGE THE VOTER APPROVAL THRESHOLD THAT SOMEONE ELSE'S BILL -- HUNDRED THIS BILL HOWEVER IF OF FUNDING MEASURES APPROVED BY THE REQUIRED NUMBER VOTERS COMMUNITIES WOULD BE INSURED INSURED THAT THE DECISION TO TAX THEMSELVES WOULD NOT BE IN VAIN. AS THE REVENUES GENERATED FROM THE SALES TAX WOULD BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMMUNITIES THAT SOUGHT IT. WITH ME THIS AFTERNOON OUR REPRESENTATIVES FROM CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR JOBS -- AS WELL AS PLASTER COUNTY -- AND I WILL TURN IT OVER THEM IF THAT'S PLEASES THE CHAIR IF YOU WOULD JUST GIVE ME A SECOND SINCE WE HAVE A QUORUM -- YEAH WE'D LIKE TO DO A ROLL CALL AND SO WE CAN MOVE ON TODAY SO I WILL BE RIGHT WITH YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. AGUIAR-CURRY AGUIAR-CURRY HERE LACKEY BLOOM. BLOOM HAIR BURNER HARD FAST. RAMOS THREE OF US. THREE OF US HERE ROBERT RIVAS ROBERT RIVAS HERE VOEPEL. VOEPEL HERE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE A QUORUM WILL -- YOU CAN CONTINUE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- MY NAME IS JIM ARE -- I'M HERE AT THE REQUEST OF PLASTER COUNTY. I IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE I HAVEN'T BEEN MY THIS MICROPHONE FEW YEARS SINCE I RETIRED SO -- I GUESS IS KINDA LIKE RIDING A BIKE WILL FIND OUT -- I DO LIKE THE WAY YOU RUN A MEETING THOUGH HAVING AND FORMER CHAIR OF A THE CALIFORNIA TRANSFER TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION -- I LIKE THE WAY YOU RUN A MEETING SO FAR GOOD JOB HELPS IS I DO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THAT'S NICE THE BILL. THIS BY WAY OF BRIEF INTRODUCTION -- ACTUALLY I AM NO LONGER -- IT'S IT'S IT'S I AM RETIRED I I CAN'T SAY I REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA WINES FOR JOBS DIRECTLY ANYMORE BUT THEY ARE CERTAINLY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND I I SERVE THERE IS THERE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS -- AND IT REPRESENTS MORE THAN FIFTY THOUSAND LABOR'S HEAVY EQUIPMENT OPERATORS AND CARPENTERS. AND FIFTEEN HUNDRED CONTRACTORS. THAT BILL MOST OF THE ROADS AND BRIDGES AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT CALIFORNIANS RELY ON EVERY DAY. I ALSO SERVED FOR TWELVE YEARS -- AS A GROUP TO TOUR A GUBERNATORIAL APPOINTEE FOR TO GOVERNOR'S ON THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. LASTLY -- I'M A TWENTY YEAR RESIDENT PLASTER COUNTY WHICH IS ONE OF A NUMBER OF COUNTIES IN THE STATE THAT WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY FROM THE PROVISIONS OF AB. FOURTEEN THIRTEEN A MOST IN THIS ROOM ARE FAMILIAR. WITH ONE OF THE TOOLS AVAILABLE TO COUNTIES IN THE CALIFORNIA THAT PROVIDES THEM AUTHORITY TO SEE VOTER APPROVAL FOR A COUNTY WIDE SALES TAX FUND TO TRANSPORT -- FUND TO FUND TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS. THERE ARE CRITICALLY NEEDED BUT LACKS SUFFICIENT FUNDING. THESE DEDICATED SALES TAXES REQUIRE TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL AND IN MOST CASES ARE NOT EASY TO PASS THEY HAVE TO BE GOOD MEASURES. SUCCESSFUL TRANSPORTATION SALES TAX MEASURES REQUIRE A CAREFULLY DEVELOPED EXPENDITURE PLAN AND THAT IS THE PRODUCT OF COUNTLESS HOURS OF PUBLIC OUTREACH AND INPUT. AND ALMOST WITHOUT EXCEPTION CONSIST OF A THOUGHTFUL BALANCE OF CAPITAL PROJECTS PUBLIC TRANSIT IMPROVEMENTS SAFE ROUTES TO SCHOOLS. PROGRAMS AND PROJECTS DESIGNED TO RELIEVE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO REDUCE THE RELIANCE ON AUTOMOBILES. THERE ARE CURRENTLY TWENTY SIX OF WHAT WE CALL SELF HELP COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY PASSED IN IMPLEMENTED ONE OR MORE OF THESE MEASURES OVER THE YEARS. AS ONE WHO DEVOTED A SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT CHUNK OF MY CAREER HELPING COUNTIES TO DEVELOP THESE PLANS AND CRAFT EDUCATION CAMP CAMPAIGNS -- SEEKING VOTER APPROVAL FOR THESE MEASURES. IT WAS VERY GRATIFYING TO HAVE A PART IN HELPING PASSED OF THESE MEASURES AND THEN SEE HOW WELL MOST COUNTIES PUT THOSE FUNDS TO WORK. FOR THE BETTERMENT OF THE LOCAL RESIDENTS THE TAXPAYERS THE ECONOMY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. ON THE FLIP SIDE I CAN ALSO RELATE TO MANY SAID EXPERIENCES OF COUNTIES THAT HAVE LITERALLY EXHAUSTED THEMSELVES IN REPEATED EFFORTS TO SEEK VOTER APPROVAL. FOR CRITICALLY NEEDED TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE BUT BECAUSE OF THE DIVERSITY GEOGRAPHY AND DEMOGRAPHICS OF THE COUNTY -- HAVE NEVER BEEN ABLE TO ACHIEVE THAT SELF HELP COUNTY STATUS -- A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTEEN WOULD GIVE SUCH COUNTIES AN ADDITIONAL TOOL THAT COULD HELP THEM ADDRESS SOME OF THEIR MOST CRITICAL TRANSPORTATION NEEDS. THIS BILL AUTHORIZES SPECIFIED LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCIES THAT HAVE EXISTING TRANSFER TRANSACTION AND USE TAX AUTHORITY. TO LEVY A TRANSACTIONS AND USE TAX -- IN ANY PORTION OF US JURISDICTION. WITH TWO THIRDS VOTER APPROVAL IT'S NOT A TAX BILL IT JUST GIVES OF THEM THIS TOOL TO BE ABLE. TO SEEK A DIFFERENT SUBSET OF COUNTY MEMBERS TO BE ABLE TO VOTE ON A NEEDED INFRASTRUCTURE. AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE LOCAL TRANSPORTATION AGENCY IDENTIFIED THE PORTION OF ITS JURISDICTION. IN WHICH THE TAX WOULD APPLY PRIOR TO REPRESENTING THE PROPOSAL TO THE VOTERS FOR APPROVAL. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT REVENUES MUST ONLY BE USED IN THE AREA OF THE COUNTY WHERE THE TAX APPLIES. PLASTER COUNTY WHERE I LIVE IS A POSTER CHILD FOR WHY A. B. FOURTEEN THIRTEEN IS NEEDED OUR COUNTY IS A LONG STRIP OF LAND THAT RUNS FROM THE FLATLANDS OF LINCOLN IN ROSEVILLE UP THE FOOT HILLS THROUGH AUBURN COLFAX IN EAST TOWARD ALL THE WAY TO LAKE TAHOE. AND THE NEVADA BORDER A RECENT EFFORT TO APPROVE A TRANSPORTATION EXPENDITURE PLAN THEIR FAILED BY ONLY 2% WHEN YOU CONSIDER THAT A CONSERVATIVE VOTER A PROFILE OF PLASTER COUNTY. THAT TELLS YOU SOMETHING THERE WERE A LOT OF VOTERS THAT REALLY WANTED TO FIX SOME PROBLEMS AND THEY CAME UP JUST. SHORT OF BEING ABLE TO DO IT. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE BUT BUT SO WHAT YOU SEE AN IN PLASTER COUNTY -- THE POSSIBILITIES THAT THAT THEY COULD USE THIS BILL. FOR TO HELP THEM -- TO CRAFT A MEASURE THAT REALLY WOULD GET THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SIGNIFICANT -- INFRASTRUCTURE DONE -- IS -- IT IS WHY WE WERE IN SUPPORT OF THAT MEASURE -- IS THE WESTERN PART OF PLASTER COUNTY WHICH CONTAINS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE POPULATION -- AND AND THE MOST CONGESTION IN THE GREATEST NEED FOR TRANSPORTATION IMPROVEMENTS WHEN I MOVED THERE -- TWENTY YEARS AGO HIGHWAY -- SIXTY FIVE WAS NEWLY BUILT IT WAS A NICE PIECE OF ROAD THAT -- I KIND OF WONDERED AT THE TIME. WHY WAS THERE BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT MUCH AROUND IT YOU COULD ROLL BOWLING BALL ABOUT ROAD NEVER HAD A THING? THAT IS NOT THE CASE TODAY IN FACT JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO -- CALTRANS -- INSTITUTED A METERING PROGRAM THAT GOES FROM SIX AM TO SIX PM EVERY DAY AND INCLUDING SOME -- MOST OF THE DAY ON SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS THERE ARE VERY FEW PLACES IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA INCLUDING LA AND IN THE BAY AREA THAT HAVE THAT KIND OF METERING PROGRAM. SO YOU CAN SEE THEY HAVE SOME INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS AND THIS BILL WOULD BE IT WOULD GIVE THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO CARVE OUT AN AREA WHERE THE CITIZENS WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO VOTE ARE PROJECTS THAT THEY RECOGNIZE AND AND THAT THEY NEED AND DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO DIG IN THEIR POCKET -- SO. FOR THOSE REASONS -- I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MY NAME IS MIKE LUCAN ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PLASTER COUNTY TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AGENCY -- WE REPRESENT OUR ELECTED BOARD OF CITIES AND COUNTIES IN PLASTER COUNTY AND ALSO ARE A VITAL MEMBER OF THE SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL GOVERNMENTS WHO IS ALSO A LARGE SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL. I'M ALSO HERE IS TODAY AS A SPOKESPERSON FOR A COALITION OF ADVOCATES WHO BELIEVE AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN CAN BE ARE AFFECTED NEW TRANSPORTATION INFRASTRUCTURE TOOL. AND WE ARE VERY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT IT BY IT BEING ABLE TO ENABLE SUB REGIONS TO CHOOSE WHETHER THEY WANT TO TAX THEMSELVES HAVING THE ASSURANCE THAT THESE TAXES WILL GO BACK TO THEIR COMMUNITY. WE BELIEVE THE BILL WILL EMPOWER WHAT WE TERM AS COMMUNITIES COMMON INTEREST -- WITHIN OUR COUNTY TO BE ABLE. TO TO BECOME ABLE PARTNERS WITH THE STATE TO DELIVER THE TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS WE NEED FOR OUR STATE THAT IS GROWING VERY QUICKLY. AND WE NEED IN OUR STATES. ALL THE RESOURCES OF OUR STATE IN THE PLASTER COUNTY AND OTHER AREAS TO IMPROVE THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY. OUR COALITION IS BASED IN PLASTER COUNTY IS MADE UP OF OF OF A BROAD BASED GROUP MADE UP OF LABOR GROUPS. CHAMBERS OF COMMERCE HOUSING ADVOCATES CIVIL ENGINEERS BUSINESSPERSONS AIR QUALITY PROPONENTS OF PLANNERS WE ARE ALSO JOINED IN SUPPORT BY THE NORTH STATE BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION LABORS LOCAL.

WE ARE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STATE TO ADVANCE THE HOUSING SUPPLY OBJECTIVES IN OUR REGION IN THIS IS A VITAL PART TO BE ABLE TO DELIVER AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IN PLASTER COUNTY -- WE ARE -- VERY CONCERNED OF HOW BAD THINGS WITH A BE ABLE TO GET -- IN OUR COUNTY IF WE WERE NOT ABLE TO BECOME A SELF HELP COUNTY. AND THAT'S WHY THIS BILL IS BACKED BY SO MANY DIVERSE GROUPS IT'S BACKED AS I MENTIONED BY SAY COG THE SOLANO COUNTY TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION. THE HUMBLE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION DISTRICT. THE CALIFORNIA CAL CALLED THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIAION OF LOCAL COUNCILS OF GOVERNMENT SACRAMENTO REGIONAL TRANSIT SELF HELP COUNTIES WHICH IS THE TWENTY SIX COUNTIES THAT WERE MENTIONED BY MISTER AHRP.

DAVID OFF BARRETT JARVIS TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION -- UNFORTUNATELY OPPOSED TO YOU AB FOURTEEN THIRTEEN HERE TODAY -- MEMBERS WERE BROADLY SPEAKING JEST -- CONCERNED WITH THE AUTHORITY THAT'S BEEN PUT IN PLACE HERE TO SET A SALES TAX ON ONLY A PORTION OF IT JURISDICTIONS TERRITORY -- THIS IS PRECEDENT SETTING IN MANY WAYS OTHER MUNICIPALITIES HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE BUT YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S ONLY BEEN DONE A HANDFUL OF TIMES ACROSS THE STATE. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND WE'RE CONCERNED AND THE YOU KNOW THE THE THERE BEEN OTHER GROUPS OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE EXPRESSED THIS CONCERN Q. JUST WITH REGARDS TO TAX COMPLIANCE. YOU KNOW ANYTIME YOU'RE PICKING. WINNERS AND LOSERS WITHIN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS ARE IF YOU'RE TARGETING AND INCORPORATED AREA OF THE CITY OR COUNTY OR MUNICIPALITY -- IT DOES MAKE TAX COMPLIANCE MORE DIFFICULT -- AND JUST AGAIN PICKING AND CHOOSING WHAT YOUR TAX BASE IS GOING TO BE -- AND THEN OBVIOUSLY JUST MORE BROADLY SPEAKING THE CONSUMER ARGUMENTS CALIFORNIA ALREADY HAS THE HIGHEST SALES TAX IN THE NATION BY FAR. AND WE SHOULDN'T BE MAKING IT EASIER WITHIN THIS LEGISLATURE AUTHORIZED ADDITIONAL VERY REGRESSIVE SALES TAX EXACTIONS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WOULD ASK FOR NO VOTE.

ASSEMBLY MEMBER WALDRON WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND MEMBERS I MISS THIS COMMITTEE SO I'M HAPPY TO BE BACK TO VISIT MY BILL -- FIRST I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. AND I THINK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS ISSUE WITH ME -- THIS IS BASICALLY A SIMPLE BILL IT WOULD ENABLE A WATER DISTRICT CONTRACT WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE TO RECEIVE WATER DELIVERIES FROM AN INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ON TRIBAL LANDS. IN TWO YEARS AGO WE FACILITATED THE PROVISION OF DRINKING WATER TO TRIBAL LANDS THROUGH AB THIRTEEN SIXTY ONE WHICH WAS EDUARDO GARCIA AND I THAT BASICALLY ALLOWED WATER DISTRICTS TO SERVICE TRIBAL LANDS SO THIS IS KIND OF JUST THE OPPOSITE EXCHANGE -- TO FACILITATE THE FLOW THE OTHER WAY. SO -- PAM LOPEZ REPRESENTING THE RING CONN BAND OF INDIANS IS WITH US TODAY. TO PROVIDE ANY ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THE ISSUE. GOOD AFTERNOON WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON PAN LOPEZ ON BEHALF OF THE RING CONN BAND OF LEWIS AND YOU INDIANS. THE SIMPLE BILL WE UNDERSTAND IT'S STILL A BIT OF A WORK IN PROGRESS -- BUT THE TRIBE LOOKS FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR I. AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE -- IS THERE ANY QUESTION -- YES I AM SO SORRY. AND UP TO WHERE. I WAS MAYBE YOU WERE IN BETWEEN -- THE BILL -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS I'M BOB READ WITH READ GOVERNMENT RELATIONS TODAY ON BEHALF OF DESERT WATER AGENCY. IT'S LIKELY COUNTERINTUITIVE THAT A ONE SENTENCE BILL COULD HAVE SO MUCH PACKED INTO IN TERMS OF CONTROVERSY BUT ALLOW ME TO EXPLAIN WHAT THE ISSUES ARE -- WITH THIS BILL. FIRST AND FOREMOST IS IT CONTRAVENES FEDERAL LAW. WHEN THE CONGRESS OR THE PRESIDENT ESTABLISHES A RESERVATION -- FOR INDIANS INDIAN TRIBE. IT -- CREATES THAT WITH THE INTENTION OF ALLOWING THE SETTLEMENTS TO BECOME SELF RELIANT SELF SUFFICIENT. UNDER THE WINTERS DOCTRINE WHICH I COMMUNICATED WITH THE COMMITTEE ABOUT WHEN THE CONGRESS RESERVES LANDS THAT ALSO RESERVES WATER SUFFICIENT TO FULFILL THE PURPOSES OF THE RESERVATION. AS A MATTER OF FEDERAL LAW. AN INDIAN TRIBE DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARKET ITS FACTORIES ARE OF WATER RIGHT. FOR OFF RESERVATION USE. IF AN INDIAN TRIBE INTENDS TO SELL ITS RESERVE WATER TO A THIRD PARTY FOR USE OFF THE RESERVATION. THEN THE WATER BY DEFINITION IS BEYOND THAT WHICH IS NECESSARY. FOR USE ON THE RESERVATION TO FILL FULFILL THE RESERVATION PURPOSES AND THE TRIBE DOES NOT HAVE A RESERVE RIGHT FOR THAT WATER. SECOND THERE'S THIS -- SUPPOSE THAT NEED FOR MORE WATER STORES IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD REMIND THE COMMITTEE RESPECTFULLY THAT PROPOSITION ONE OF TWENTY FOURTEEN SOME OF YOU WERE STILL -- WE'RE HERE -- SET SET ASIDE TWO POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR INVESTMENTS IN NEW WATER STORAGE PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA. THE WATER COMMISSION AND IS ADMINISTERING THE WATER STORES INVESTMENT PROGRAM. THEY CALLED FOR PROJECTS TO BE BROUGHT FORWARD AND APPROVED FUNDING FOR EIGHT PROJECTS -- WITH A MAXIMUM WATER STORAGE CAPACITY FOUR POINT THREE MILLION ACRE FEET. NONE OF THOSE PROJECTS RUN RESERVATION LANDS -- AND FINALLY -- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE IS SINCE THIS IS THE AUTHOR REMOVED GROUNDWATER IS ONE OF THE WATER SOURCES THAT MAY BE USED UNDER THE BILL WE'RE DEALING WITH TWO OTHER SOURCES SPRING? WHICH IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO BE DIVERTED TO SUPPORT A MUNICIPAL PURPOSE OR DAM MEAN A RIVER OR STREAM. THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO DEVELOP WATER ON A RESERVATION SITE OTHER THAN THOSE. TWO AND I CAN JUST SAY THAT -- BASED ON EXPERIENCE THAT THERE ARE SUCH STREAMS AND RIVERS -- IT'S QUESTIONABLE WHETHER TRY WOULD SUPPORT CONSTRUCTION OF A DAM AND RESERVOIR ON TRIBAL LANDS. A NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S HAVE HAD CONTINUAL INTERACTS WITH RIVERS AND STREAMS OVER SEVERAL MILLENNIA AND THEIR SOCIAL ADDITIONAL AND SPIRITUAL ACTIVITIES HAVE BECOME INSEPARABLE FROM THE RIVERS THEMSELVES -- YOU DON'T ONE CAN ONLY LOOK TO THE HOOP BUT KERIK IN EUROPE TRIBES IN THE NORTH COAST. AND THE WOMEN WENT TO TRIBE WHO'S FIGHTING THE SHASTA DAM REYES. NOW THE SHASTA DAM REYES WAS NOT ONE OF THE EIGHT PROJECTS ON THE WATER COMMISSION LIST. BUT THE WOMEN WENT TO TRIBE ARGUES THAT WITHOUT THEIR SACRED SITES ALONG THE CLOUD RIVER. WHICH WE WOULD BE LOST INUNDATION WOMEN CULTURE COULD NO LONGER EXIST SO THERE THERE'S ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES WITH THIS BILL. THERE'S CONFLICT WITH FEDERAL RESERVE RIGHTS AND ESTABLISHED FEDERAL LAW. THERE'S ALSO POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO WRITE TYRIAN SYSTEMS. NATIVE AMERICAN FISHERIES SUBSTANCE FISHERIES AND WHAT HAVE YOU AND I REALIZE THIS IS LOCAL GOVERNMENT COMMITTEE AND TO BRING THESE ISSUES BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE IS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE. BUT THIS WAS SINGLE REFERRED TO THIS COMMITTEE IT REALLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE WATER COMMITTEE BUT AGAIN A ONE SENTENCE BILL. BUT IT IT BRINGS A LOT OF CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES TO THE TABLE AND I FELT COMPELLED ON BEHALF OF THE WATER AGENCY TO BRING THESE BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND BE PLEASED TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION OF THIS BILL. SAYING THAT ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OF THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM. I JUST WANNA SAY I'M CONCERNED THAT -- BY THE COMMENTS THAT I'VE HEARD FROM -- THE OPPOSITION -- I'D APPRECIATE IT IF THE PROPONENT COULD ADDRESS THEM AND I'M INCLINED TO MOVE THE BILL FORWARD TODAY -- BUT WOULD. ARE. PENDING RECEIPT OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION -- RESERVE MY VOTE ON THE FLOOR. WELL -- THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM AND AS WE KNOW NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES ARE SOVEREIGN NATIONS. THEY HAVE THEIR OWN -- TREATIES AND AGREEMENTS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THIS BILL AS A STATE BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE ANY OF THAT -- IN FACT THE BILL LANGUAGE INCLUDES THAT NOTHING WILL. DETER -- NOTHING IN THIS SECTION DETERMINES OUR ALTERS EXISTING WATER RIGHTS -- THE BILL WOULD NOT INFRINGE ON THEIR SOVEREIGNTY AND IT IN IN THE FACT THE BILL AFFECTS THE AUTHORITY OF WATER DISTRICTS TO ACT. IT DOES NOT IN ANY WAY AFFECT TRIBES TO ACT OR TO DO ANYTHING SOME [inaudible] ASSEMBLYMEMBER -- LOUIS RIGHT FROM THIS. THANK YOU MANAGER AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONCERN FOR AND THE WATER DISTRICT AS FAR AS PROTECTING NATIVE AMERICAN RESOURCES THAT ARE THERE. HOPEFULLY WE'LL HEAR THAT. LATER ON IN DIFFERENT DIALOG IN DIFFERENT ENGAGEMENTS WITH THE TRIBES AND DOWN THE ROAD. BUT GETTING BACK -- TO THOUGH THE WATER RESOURCES ON THE RESERVATION BEING ABLE TO SELL THOSE -- AREAS I KNOW OF THE FUTURE LIVES THAT ARE CURRENTLY DOING THAT -- SELLING THE WATERS TO DIFFERENT AREAS DIFFERENT -- AS A MATTER OF FACT THERE'S ONE OUT IN -- IN IN NEEDLES IN THE AREA OUT THERE THERE'S PROVIDING WATER TO THE CITY -- SO THAT IS ON GOING AND I THINK BEING ABLE -- TO SUPPORT THE THIS BILL MOVIE FOR SOMETHING THAT THAT I WILL DO AND COURAGE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TO ALSO DOING WITH THAT AMOUNT OF CHARM OF THE BILL. THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMITMENTS ANY OTHER COMMENTS. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION. AND WE HAVE A SECOND. OF SOME ROOM -- THIS RIVER SAYS THE SECOND OKAY. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS WE KNOW WATER IS ONE OF MY OUR MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCES. AND WE IT'S STILL ESTIMATED THAT MORE THAN A MILLION CALIFORNIANS DID NOT HAVE ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER -- BY ALLOWING WATER DISTRICTS TO RECEIVE WATER DELIVERIES FROM INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ON TOP TRIBAL LANDS IT'S A POTENTIAL SUPPLY SIDE SOLUTION AS WELL. FOR ADDITIONAL WATER AND I ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER -- FOR ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS TO ADD AFIVE YEAR SUNSET DATE. THIS WILL HELP THE LEGISLATURE RETAIN OVERSIGHT OF THIS NEW AUTHORITY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WITH THAT THE SECRETARY. MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY I A LACKEY BLOOM.

IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT LOCAL VOTERS TO LET THEIR CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS TO MAKE PUBLIC POLICY IN RESPONSE TO LOCAL NEEDS. DECIDING HOW TO APPLY LOCAL TAXES TO GENERATE LOCAL REVENUES IS PRECISELY WHAT COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE ELECTED TO DO. EXEMPTING CLEAN ENERGY RESOURCES FROM YOU YOU TEASE ROADS LOCAL OFFICIALS ABILITY TO MANAGE LOCAL AFFAIRS BY MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO RAISE GENERAL FUND REVENUES. LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS AND THE VOTERS TO HIM THERE ACCOUNTABLE ARE THE BEST PERSON TO JUDGE THE MERITS OF IMPOSING A YOU UT. THERE ARE THESE ARE PLANS ARE VERY CRITICAL AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY GO TO FUND PUBLIC SAFETY SERVICES POLICE FIRE PARKS -- AND LIBRARIES THEIR FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR COMMUNITY EXTENDING A STATE MANDATED EXEMPTION OF A LOCALLY APPROVED LOCALLY COLLECTED REVENUE SOURCE IS WE BELIEVE THE SIMPLY BAD POLICY. WELL THE BILL HAS NOBLE GOALS TO HELP RENEWABLE ENERGY IN THE FUTURE AND WE LIKE THE STATE ARE HEADED TOWARDS A 100% CLEAN ENERGY. WE BELIEVE THAT'S THE THE EXTENSION OF THIS MEASURE HAS FAR REACHING REVENUE IMPLICATIONS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. PRESENTING AB. ADDING AB. NINE NINE TWO AB NINE AND TWO SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT MEMBERS OF A LOCAL ELECTED BODY MAY ENGAGE IN SOCIAL MEDIA. PROVIDED THEY DO NOT INTERACT IN ANY WAY THAT VIOLATES THE RALPH M. BROWN ACT. SPECIFICALLY AB NINE NINE TWO ALLOWS MEMBERS TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA. PROVIDED THAT A MAJORITY OF MEMBERS DO NOT DISCUSS AMONG THEMSELVES BUSINESS OF A SPECIFIC NATURE. THAT IS WITHIN THE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OF THE LEGISLATIVE BODY. OR OR LOCAL AGENCY LET ME BE CLEAR. AB NINE NINE TWO DOES NOT UNDERMINE EXISTING BROWN ACT PROHIBITIONS. BUT CLARIFIES THE GRAY AREA THAT MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS AND THEIR LEGAL TEAMS ARE STRUGGLING WITH. WHEN CONNECTING WITH THEIR CONSTITUENTS? WITH EVOLVING FORMS OF COMMUNICATION AND PARTICIPATION IN SOCIAL MEDIA PLATFORMS LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE INDICATING TO ME. THAT IT IS UNCLEAR WHAT IS ALLOWED WHEN INTERACTING WITH THE PUBLIC ON SOCIAL MEDIA. SOMETHING NOT CONSIDERED WHEN THE BROWN ACT WAS FIRST ENACTED IN. NINETEEN FIFTY THREE THE DEMOCRATIZING ASPECT OF SOCIAL MEDIAS THAT A GIVE CITIZENS NEARLY FULL ACCESS TO THEIR ELECTED OFFICIALS. PRIOR TO THE ADVENT OF SOCIAL MEDIA CONSTITUENTS ONLY ACCESS WAS TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT TO SEE THEIR ELECTED OFFICIAL. HAPPEN TO RUN INTO THEM WHEN THEY'RE OUT ABOUT FOUR TEN COUNCIL MEETINGS TODAY THE PUBLIC HAS TWENTY FOUR HOUR ACCESS AND CAN VOICE THEIR OPINIONS. I UNDERSTAND THERE ARE CONCERNS REGARDING HOW NARROW SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS MIGHT BE. THE INTENTION IS TO PROVIDE ENOUGH GUIDANCE FOR THE COURTS TO DECIDE WHAT CONSTITUTES A VIOLATION WHEN ISSUES DO OCCUR. THIS BILL DOES NOT ENCOURAGE OR ALLOW LOCAL OFFICIALS TO DELIBERATE. WITHOUT NOTICE ON SOCIAL MEDIA BUT INSTEAD PROVIDE STRUCTURE AND CLARITY TO INTERACTIONS THAT ARE MOST LIKELY ALREADY HAPPENING ONLINE. I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT ACCESS TO SOCIAL MEDIA IS NOT 1100% BUT THAT IS A SEPARATE ISSUE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUE WHICH A CONCERN THAT I SHARE. WITH MADAM CHAIR. BUT THE FACT IS MOST CITIZENS TODAY ARE CONNECTED ONLINE AND MANY TO SOCIAL MEDIA AS A WAY TO INTERACT WITH THEIR ELECTED. AND I'M SURE WE ALL EXPERIENCE FROM OUR OWN SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS MANY OF THOSE CITIZENS ARE VERY COMFORTABLE EXPRESSING THEIR OPINIONS. ON ISSUES THAT MATTER TO THEM. TO TO PUT IT LIGHTLY OUGHT TO EXCLUDE A SOCIAL MEDIA PARTICIPATION HARM CIVIC ENGAGEMENT AND DOES A DISSERVICE TO THE PUBLIC WHILE UNDERMINING TRANSPARENCY. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT AS WE WERE WORKING ON A DRAFT OF A AB NINE NINE TWO WE SPECIFICALLY ASKED LEGISLATIVE COUNSEL WHETHER IN THEIR OPINION WE WERE DOING ANYTHING TO UNDERMINE THE BROWN ACT BECAUSE THAT'S NOT SOMETHING I WANT TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH. THEIR ANSWER WAS DEFINITIVELY NO. AS I CONVEYED TO THEM AND THEY UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO IS TO SIMPLY CLARIFY WHAT'S APPROPRIATE AND WHAT'S NOT IN THE DIGITAL AGE. WE ARE OPEN TO CONTINUE WORKING ON LANGUAGE TO REFINE THE BILL IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS WE WE RECEIVE SEVERAL COMMENTS ON HOW. TO A BETTER APPROACH THIS ISSUE AND AND TWEAK THE LANGUAGE I AM HAPPY TO ENGAGE WITH MEMBERSOF THIS COMMITTEE. AND TO THAT END OF ANY MEMBERS WOULD LIKE TO SIGN ON AS CO AUTHORS WE ALWAYS WELCOME THAT OF COURSE WITH ME TODAY IS DANE HUTCHINGS FROM THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES AS WELL AS DEALING GIVEN FROM THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS. ASSOCIATION TO PRESENT THEIR PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU ARE CHAIR MEMBERS TING HUTCHINGS WITH THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES I DON'T KNOW IF I COULD HAVE DONE QUITE AS GOOD A JOB AS THE AS THE MEMBER ARTICULATING THE IMPORTANCE OF THE MEASURE -- BUT WE CERTAINLY DO -- ARE TRUMP SUPPORT THE BILL -- AS AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAID THAT WE WE ARE SIMPLY SEEKING GUIDANCE I CAN TELL YOU FIRSTHAND TALKING -- TO CITY ATTORNEYS ACROSS THE STATE -- THEY HAVE CONFLICTING COUNSEL SOME MEMBERS BELIEVE THEY CAN ENGAGE A LITTLE BIT MORE SOME FOLKS I ARE ARE ARE TAKING ALL DO CAUTION NOT ENGAGING. THE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA CITIES WAS THAT WITH THE CHIEF SPONSOR THE BROWN ACT AS THE IT WE ABSOLUTELY -- BELIEVE IN IN TRANSPARENCY -- BELIEVE IN CIVIC ENGAGEMENT WE BELIEVE AT THIS BILL ENHANCES THAT -- YOU KNOW WHEN AS THE MEMBER SAID -- THIS MODERNIZE THE BROWN ACT TO REFLECT THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AS REALLY THE NEW COMMUNITY MEETING WE WHEN WHEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE ON CRAFTING THIS MEASURE WE SPECIFICALLY -- PUT IT INTO THE COMMUNITY MEETINGS EXCEPTIONS IN THE BROWN ACT THIS IS NOT -- TAKE AWAY OPTIONS FOR FOLKS WHO DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET I MEAN THIS IS SIMPLY SAYING THAT YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAVING IT PERHAPS A NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION MEETING OR YOU NEED THESE COMMITTEE MEETINGS WERE ACCOUNT NUMBERS PERMITTED TO GO AND AND AND EXPRESS THEIR VIEWS AND OPINIONS. WE'RE WE'RE PUTTING THIS IS IN THE SAME AYE BECAUSE SOCIAL MEDIA REALLY HAS BECOME THE NEW PLACE WHERE PEOPLE CAN ACT AND DISCUSS IMPORTANT ISSUES PERTAINING TO THEIR TO THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENT -- YOU KNOW I I KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME THERE IS SOME OPPOSITION TO THE MEASURE I HAVE SPOKEN -- TO THE THOSE FOLKS WILL UNDOUBTEDLY BE COMING UP IN UP AND AND SHARING THEIR VIEWS THAT WE ARE VERY MUCH WILLING TO WORK WITH THEM -- IT SHOULD THE COMMITTEE -- MOVE THIS MEASURE -- THE LAST THING WE WANT TO DO -- IS IS UNDERMINE THE INTENT OF THE BROWN ACT THIS IS A STARTING POINT -- HOPING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO CRAFT A SOLUTION THAT WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO LOCAL OFFICIALS BY ENHANCING TRANSPARENCY ENHANCING SEVEN GAUGE ME. THANK YOU -- CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEES DON'T GIVENS WITH CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- DON'T HAVE MUCH MORE TO TO ADD TO THE ROBUST -- TESTIMONY THIS ALREADY BEEN PROVIDED -- JUST. FOR PROPUBLICA AGENCIES WE WE ARE CONTINUING TO ENCOURAGE THEM -- TO ENGAGE IN OUTREACH TO THE PUBLIC. THIS BILL PROVIDES THAT CLEARLY TO ALLOW THEM TO DO SO. I THINK MANY OF YOU HAVE SERVED IN A LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND AND PREVIOUS CAPACITY YOU KNOW THE FEAR THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE BROWN ACT IN THE SERIAL MEETINGS AND THAT SOMETIMES IT THAT THAT THAT CAUSES YOU TO DO. NOTHING TO TO FREEZE UP TO TO THEIR TO FEAR TO NOT -- GO OUT AND AND COMMENTS AND SO THIS BILL JUST PROVIDE THAT CLEARLY IT ALLOWS. PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO GO OUT AND ENGAGE WITH THE PUBLIC. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SING THEN ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIM E. WHAT WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION -- I'D LIKE TO TO SAY AT THE OUTSET THAT IDEOLOGICALLY SEEIN PAY IS NOT OPPOSED TO THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BY ELECTED MEMBERS OF BROWN ACT BODIES. BUT BASED ON THE PROPOSAL BUT IT'S CURRENTLY BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WE HAVE SOME VERY SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT HOW IT WOULD OPERATE. ON THE BROWN ACT WAS PASSED -- BACK IN NINETEEN FIFTY THREE FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE TO GUARANTEE THAT THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS -- CONDUCTED BY A LOCAL AGENCY IS DONE IN AN OPEN AND PUBLIC MANNER -- AND ONE OF THE KEY COMPONENTS OF THAT IS TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO THE PUBLIC OF WHAT IT IS THAT THE BODY INTENDS. TO DO WHETHER IT'S A DELIBERATION WHETHER IT'S DISCUSSION WHETHER IT'S AN ACTION. AND SOCIAL MEDIA IN AND OF ITSELF ONE OF THE KEY CHARACTERISTICS OF SOCIAL MEDIA -- THAT MAKES IT SUCH A A GLAMOROUS THING TO USE -- IS ITS SPONTANEITY A JUST LIKE A CONVERSATION IN A ROOM WHERE YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHERE IT'S GOING TO GO -- WHICH MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR BODY TO PROVIDE THE REQUISITE NOTICE IN THE ACT RIGHT NOW. UNFORTUNATELY SB NINE NINETY DOES NOT ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- AND IT'S REALLY HARD TO ENVISION -- AT LEAST UNDER THE THE LANGUAGE NOW. OUR HOW OF THE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA BY A BODY WOULD NOT VIOLATE THE SERIAL MEETING UP PROVISION OF THE BROWN ACT WHICH AGAIN IS A KEY COMPONENT OF THE BROWN ACT. TO ENSURE THAT THE PUBLIC'S BUSINESS IS DONE OPENLY AND PUBLICLY. FOR EXAMPLE IF WE LOOK AT THE DEFINITION OF DISCUSS AMONGST THEMSELVES THERE ARE TWO EXCEPTIONS. TO THAT -- THAT TERM IN THE BILL ONE IS -- IT WOULD ALLOW INDIVIDUAL COMMUNICATIONS ARE MADE POSTED OR SHARED. TO THAT SO LONG AS THE COMMUNICATIONS BY A MEMBER OF THE BODY DO NOT DIRECTLY RESPOND TO ANOTHER MEMBERS COMMUNICATIONS. BUT THAT DOES NOT PRECLUDE OF THIRD PARTY FROM REFERRING TO A MEMBERS COMMUNICATION -- IN A SUBSEQUENT SERIES OF COMMUNICATIONS ARE -- TWEET THAT REFERENCES OF ONE MEMBERS -- COMMUNICATION BY TWO OTHER MEMBERS OF A FIVE MEMBER BODY. WOULD BE A VIOLATION UNDER THE LAW IN ANY OTHER. CONTEXT BUT NOT UNDER THE LANGUAGE IN -- EIGHTY NINE NINETY TWO SIMILARLY OF THE USE OF ICONS OR OTHER -- IMHO JEEZ IF YOU WILL -- TO COMMUNICATE AN IDEA OR OPINION OR THOUGHT -- IF ASSUMING AGAIN A FIVE MEMBER BODY YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL -- MEMBER WHO -- EXPRESSES A FOUGHT ON A POSITION ON AN ISSUE BEFORE THE BODY. TO OTHER MEMBERS GIVE A THUMBS UP. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY'RE IN AGREEMENT HAS CONSENSUS BEEN REACHED THAT IS TOTALLY UNCLEAR UNDER THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW? SO RATHER THAN CLARIFY I THINK IT RAISES ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. THERE IS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ISSUE THAT EXIST ARM AND THAT -- IS NOT ONLY THOSE THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET BUT THERE MAY BE THOSE THAT HAVE ACCESS TO THE INTERNET BUT DON'T CHOOSE TO USE SOCIAL MEDIA. OUR AS A MEANS OF COMMUNICATION AND SO THEY WOULD BE. EXCLUDED FROM THE DEVELOPMENT OF PUBLIC POLICY OR EVEN THE FORMAL ACTION OF A POTENTIAL OF VOTE BY BY A BODY -- HAVING SAID ALL THAT -- WE RECOGNIZE THAT SOCIAL MEDIA IS AN EFFECTIVE TOOL FOR CONSTITUENTS TO USE TO COMMUNICATE WITH THE ELECTED MEMBERS OF THEIR BODY -- AND WE WILL STAND READY WILLING AND ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE DISCUSSIONS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF GOOD SOCIAL MEDIA POLICY -- AS IT MOVES FORWARD -- WE HAVE HAD THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEAGUE WITH THE SPECIAL DISTRICTS -- UNFORTUNATELY THE BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN NOW -- DOESN'T GET US THERE QUITE YET -- AND IF THE COMMITTEE DOES DECIDE TO MOVE THE BILL ON OR DECIDES NOT TO MOVE THE BILL ON NONE THE LESS WE STAND READY WILLING AND ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS BUT AS OF NOW -- WE'RE ASKING FOR NO LOOK. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THE OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE OTHER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER WARNER ARE. FOR I MAY GET A RIGHT ONE DAY SUCH AS THE BATES HOSSA OR TBH. TBH WORKS -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR IN THE LEAGUE FOR THIS I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS SWORN IN AND IN MY NEW COUNCILMEMBER TRAINING TWENTY SIXTEEN WITH THE LEAGUE OF CITIES. I WAS SHOCKED TO LEARN THAT IF ME AND TO MY COLLEAGUES ALL INCIDENTLY LIKE THE SAME. ARTICLE ON FACEBOOK THAT THAT COULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED A BROWN ACT VIOLATION AND YOU KNOW SINCE THE PURVIEW OF LOCAL COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE PRIDE FROM ANYTHING FROM BIKE LANES TO ROADS TO POT HOLES. TO PEOPLE SHARING THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT SAFETY AND AND AND ARE YOU KNOW OUR COMMUNITY -- I WAS SHOCKED AND SO I SEE THIS BILL I THINK IT'S A GOOD MOVE AND CLARIFICATION A MUCH NEEDED MOVE IN CLARIFICATION. OF WHAT'S ALLOWED WHAT'S NOT ALLOWED I REMEMBER I ONCE WENT AFTER HAVE THAT TRAINING VERY GOOD TRAINING -- I WENT THROUGH AND SCROLL THROUGH THREE HUNDRED LIKES TO SEE IF ANY OF MY OTHER COUNCIL MEMBERS SELECTED BECAUSE I OF COURSE I DIDN'T WANT TO VIOLATE THE PRODUCT. AND IN THE END YOU KNOW AND WHEN YOU HAVE SMALLER COMMUNITIES MY CITY WAS ONLY SIXTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE -- YOU KNOW IT THAT WOULD BE AND AND STILL NOTHING THAT WOULD CAUSE A LOT OF RECORDS FOR FOR NO REAL INTENT OF ESTABLISHING -- AN ACTUAL POLICY POSITION OR HAVING AND AND AND MEETING AND SO I THINK THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT -- BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU -- AND THE LEAGUE FOR BRING IT FOR AND HOW THAT CLARIFICATION I THINK I LOVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS AN ELECTED SCHOOL NEED THANK YOU. SEVEN RIVER ROBERT RIVAS. SO I I COMMEND THE AUTHOR OVER FOR TACKLING THIS ISSUE YOU KNOW I THINK THAT -- CERTAINLY ATTENDING TO DRAW ALSO CO LINES OF COMPLIANCE IS A GOOD THING WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SOCIAL MEDIA I THINK YOU KNOW AS AS AS A SAY YOU KNOW AS WAS STATED. SOCIAL MEDIA IS A YOU KNOW A VEHICLE WHERE MOST OF US GET OUR NEWS AND CERTAINLY STAY CONNECTED WITH ONE ANOTHER AND I REPRESENT A DISTRICT THAT HAS A LOT OF SMALLER JURISDICTIONS AND CITIES. IN THE ISSUES I HAVE IS IN YOU KNOW I THINK WHAT I'M LOOKING AT THE LEGISLATION IS. PROVIDE SOME CLARITY AS FAR AS THE INTERACTIONS AMONGST THE ELECTED OFFICIALS THEMSELVES BECAUSE WHAT I SEE IS. THESE COUNCIL MEMBERS ARE SUPERVISORS ENGAGING WITH ONE ANOTHER AND COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT. KNOWING THAT TO MY COLLEAGUES ARE TAKING A POSITION ON SOMETHING [inaudible] YOU NOW. SHOWING ME THEIR CARS AND WHERE THEY STAND ON ISSUES IN MY OPINION POSES A PROBLEM AND SOMETIMES EVEN A THIRD WILL JUMP IN BUT THERE'S SUCH A LACK OF CLARITY IS SUCH A GRAY AREA WHEN IT COMES THE BROWN ACT. ASSISTANT I APPRECIATE LEGISLATION I THINK THAT IT NEEDS TO BE STRAIGHTENED A BIT -- TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ADDRESS NOT ALLOWABLE IN INTO THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN ELECTED OFFICIALS BUT AS FAR AS THEM USING THIS AS A VEHICLE. TO ENGAGE THEIR CITIZENS THE CONSTITUENCIES I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND SO ANYWAY THAT WE CAN STRENGTHEN OUR ABILITY. TO TO CLARIFY -- OUR ABILITY TO USE IT AND LOCAL OFFICIALS THESE IT I THINK IS A VERY POSITIVE STEP. FOR A SIMILAR SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER RENEWS REAVIS. THANK YOU -- YOU KNOW PRIOR TO BEING ELECTED -- TO THE ASSEMBLY I SERVED ON THE COMMISSION THAT WAS GOVERNED BY -- THE BROWN ACT AND DEFINITELY. I'M AWARE OF A LOT OF THE ISSUES YOU KNOW RELATED TO THIS BUT AFTER HEARING OPPOSITION ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT. MAY BE AND CLEAR IS WHAT THE DEFINITION OF A DISCUSSION IS RIGHT LIKE -- WHAT -- THE THE OPPOSITION WAS SAYING WAS WHERE THERE IS YOU KNOW LIKE THE THUMBS UP. YOU KNOW I ENVISIONED DISCUSSION WHERE. THEIR COMMON TEAM YOU KNOW MAYBE THREE OUT OF THE FIVE MEMBERS OF A A BODY ARE COMMON TEEN AND HAVING A DISCUSSION I I MEAN IT. I'M CURIOUS IF YOU'VE THOUGHT OF THAT OR IF -- LIKE IT COULD POTENTIALLY MAKE IT EVEN GREATER ON WHAT. THE DISCUSSION IS YOU KNOW I'M NOT. IF IF IT'S NOT DEFINED RIGHT IN THE BILL. SO THANK YOU ASSEMBLY WOMAN AND NOW WE HAVE BEEN GRAPPLING. WITH THAT DEFINITION AS WELL I JUST WANTED. TO TO MENTION. THAT WE ARE A SPECIFIED IN THE BROWN ACT IS APPLICABLE. TO SOCIAL MEDIA WITH REGARD TO BUSINESS OF A SPECIFIC NATURE. IN THE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OF THE BODY. SO -- UNDER A SCENARIO WHERE -- A MEMBER -- OF THE CITY COUNCIL THE MAYOR WERE TO POST SOMETHING SPECIFIC ABOUT A OF AN ISSUE A DEVELOPMENT COMING BEFORE THE BOARD. AND THERE WAS A LEVEL OF INTERACTION LIKES AND SO FORTH. THERE'S A LACK OF CLARITY ON WHETHER OR NOT THAT REPRESENTS CONSENSUS. BUT UNDER THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AS IT'S CONSTRUCTED. THOUGHT THAT WOULD BE SOMETHING OF A SPECIFIC NATURE IN THE SUBJECT MATTER JURISDICTION OF THE BODY AND I KNOW ASSEMBLY -- THE OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBER REQUESTS -- IS SUBMITTED -- SOME. LANGUAGE. TO TO MAKETHAT ABUNDANTLY CLEAR. AND I AM ABSOLUTELY MORE THAN HAPPY TO ENGAGE THAT I WANT TO BRING CLARITY RIGHT NOW THE STATUS QUO IS UNACCEPTABLE THERE'S A THERE'S A GREAT DEAL OF ANXIETY. AMONG LOCAL OFFICIALS THE I'M I'M A FORMER CITY COUNCIL MEMBER MAYOR. AND IT WAS JUST AS SOCIAL MEDIA WAS KIND OF GETTING ROLLING -- AND AND WE WERE TIED UP IN KNOTS A LITTLE BIT SO I HAVE PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THAT REGARD. AS SOCIAL MEDIA HAS BECOME UBIQUITOUS THIS REALLY IS AN ISSUE CONFRONTED. BY LOCAL OFFICIALS CELL WERE ATTEMPTING TO BRING CLARITY HEAR. THE STATUS QUO IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THIS BILL IS NOT PERFECT I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE NEWS PAPER PUBLISHERS I KNOW THE LEAGUE -- AND THE OTHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOLKS ARE AS WELL THERE IS A SOLUTION IN HERE TO AT LEAST HAVE A ROAD MAP GOING FOR THAT BRING SOME. CERTAINTY TO LOCAL OFFICIALS BUT ALSO BRINGS THE BROWN ACT INTO THE DIGITAL ERA AND CALIFORNIA OUGHT TO BE LEADING ON THIS ISSUE AS GROUND ZERO FOR MANY OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES SELL -- THANK YOU FOR THAT COMMENT AND I TOTALLY COMMITTED -- TO TO BRINGING FURTHER FURTHER CLARITY AS NEEDED HERE. YEAH THANK YOU I MEAN I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THIS DISCUSSION I'M SURE IT'S DIFFICULT TO TRY TO ADAPT TO WHAT. 1-953-220-1920 TWENTY GREAT -- AND I'M SURE IT'S NOT EASY TO GET ON THE FIRST TRY BUT I I LOOK FORWARD -- FOR YOU TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS AND MAKE IT CLEAR FOR EVERYONE INVOLVED THANK YOU. ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES. SOME MEMBER ALMOST THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THERE IS A IT'S A GREAT TOPIC AND I THINK FOR ME -- HOW MUCH DIALOGUE HAS BEEN DONE IT LIKE THE COUNTY LEVELS WITH COUNTY COUNCIL COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS AS FAR AS IMPLEMENTING A POLICY AND COMPLIANCE WITH THE BROWN ACT? AT THE LOCAL LEVEL -- BEFORE WE GET TO THE POINT TO WHERE WE'RE AT NOW. YEAH. I'M I'M HAVING A JOB AND I'M I'M. LEADERS CITY LIKE A CITIES YEAH I MEAN WE IT'S SO IT'S SO YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WHAT'S BEEN DONE AS FAR AS AS AS ASSEMBLYMEMBER HARD ABOUT SAID WE WE ARE WE THE LEAGUE ITSELF CONDUCTS TRAININGS -- BUT WHAT WHAT WE ALSO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE THAT THE LEAGUE DOES NOT PROVIDE DIRECTLY -- COUNCIL IN THAT WE UNDER THE CURRENT PARADIGM WE HAVE TO THEM PUSH -- THOSE CONVERSATIONS LOCALLY TO OUR CITY ATTORNEYS AND SEEK THEIR COUNSEL AND SO THAT'S REALLY YOU KNOW WHEN. WHEN COMING UP WITH THIS CONCEPT -- WE IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES HAS A BROWN ACT WORKING GROUP COMPRISED OF CITY ATTORNEY'S ACROSS CALIFORNIA AND REALLY WHEN WE WERE DISCUSSING THIS ISSUE. IF YOU KNOW WHAT THE SAME CISCO CITY ATTORNEY SEES A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAT AND YOU KNOW THEN THE CITY ATTORNEY THAT'S THAT'S DOWN SOUTH -- AND SO THERE IS THAT THAT IS PRECISELY WHERE WITH THE IMPETUS THIS BILL CAME FROM IS THAT WE COULDN'T COME TO A CONSENSUS BECAUSE WITH REGARD TO THE BROWN ACT IT WAS PASSED. NINETEEN FIFTY THREE WERE YOU KNOW WERE WERE WARNED IT AND DON'T YOU KNOW AND ENGAGING AND AND AND IN THE DIGITAL AGE. AND SO THAT'S EXACTLY WHY WE WANTED THIS MEASURE FOR CLARITY BECAUSE IT IS A STATE WIDE STATUE THAT WE HAVE TO FOLLOW BUT THE INTERPRETATIONS VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. I THINK PART OF MY OF MY QUESTION IS YOU KNOW IT'S A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GONNA BE IMPACTED BY. ANY RULES THAT ARE ADOPTED WITH THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. OR NOT BUT IT'S AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WHERE THAT. THAT DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE HELD IN OPEN FORUM ON WHETHER IT'S AT THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS A CITY COUNCIL BECAUSE THEY'RE THE ONES THAT ARE GOING TO BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE TO THAT POLICY THAT'S THEIRWELL I SAID ON THE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE HAD A DAT. THE THE BROWN ACTED IMPLEMENT NEW POLICIES TO CONTINUE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE AND WE HAD -- STUDY SESSIONS WE HAD A SERIES OF OPEN DIALOGUE WITH THE PUBLIC INVOLVEMENT ALL THOSE DIFFERENT. AREAS TO HAVE THAT THAT ENCOURAGEMENT OF THAT POLICY MOVING FORWARD ULTIMATELY COUNTY COUNCIL WOULD MOVE FORWARD WE WRAPPED UP AS A BOARD. THAT BECOMES PART OF THE THE ADHERENCE TO THE TO THE POLICY THAT'S THEIR THIS. WITHOUT KNOWING THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE EXHAUSTED ALL THAT THAT'S THERE AND AND THEIR PURVIEW TO IMPLEMENT THAT RULE AND COMPLY WITH THE BROWN ACT IT'S IN THAT PURVIEW THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE FOLLOWING. BECAUSE WE DON'T FOLLOW THE BROWN ACT HERE ON THESE DIESIS SO HAS THE LOCAL JURISDICTION BUT EXHAUSTED. TO COMPLY ARE TO COME UP WITH NEW DIFFERENT -- ORDINANCES OR REGULATIONS TO COMPLY WITH A BROWN AT THE DEAL WITH THE THE SOCIAL MEDIA ASPECT YEAH AND I AND I THAT'S THAT'S A THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I'LL SAY THAT I I THE THE FEEDBACK I'VE RECEIVED FROM. FROM MIKE AT MY CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS AND AND MY CITY ATTORNEY'S IS IS THAT THEY HAVE HAD THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND HAVE HAVE YOU KNOW TRIED. TO THE BEST THEY CAN -- INTERPRET WHICH UNDER THE UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF THE BROWN ACT. IT IS IT IS THEIR JOB TO INTERPRET THOSE PROVISIONS TO ADD TO THAT WERE YOU SEE THE CONFUSION LYING I MEAN EVEN WITHIN JURISDICTION WITH AND GIVE THE COUNTY WHAT YOU KNOW CITIES WITHIN THE COUNTY THAN SPECIAL DISTRICTS WITHIN WITHIN THE CITY OR COUNTY JURISDICTION. YOU HAVE DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS THROUGHOUT THAT COUNTY OPERATING UNDER DIFFERENT DIFFERENT COUNCILS BECAUSE EVERY EVERY ATTORNEY I HAVE A DIFFERENT -- PROTECTION HOW TO FOLLOW FOLLOW -- YOU KNOW THE THE THIS SORT OF NEW ERA -- VIGIL AGENT SO I I WOULD SAY THAT THAT -- WE CERTAINLY YOU KNOW AS AS PURVEYORS OF LOCAL CONTROL AND WE WANT EVERYTHING TO BE HAPPENING LOCALLY IT'S RARE THAT WE COME TO THE STATE SAYING WE NEED HELP PROVIDING A SUITE WE NEED STATEWIDE SOLUTION FOR THIS -- THAT PROVIDES THE GUIDANCE THAT IT THAT IS NEEDED FOR OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS BECAUSE YOU KNOW MY MY GUYS DON'T LIKE SAY THEY NEED HELP IN THE STATE BUT IN THIS CASE THEY THEY START THEY THEY THEY CERTAINLY DO. I THINK IT THE QUESTION OF THE SEWING ROOM WALL IN HIS IS MORE ON EXHAUSTING THE RESOURCE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. TO ADOPT A POLICY THAT'S GOING TO BE. HAD HERE TO BUY THE THE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT ARE THERE AND I'M NOT SURE I'M HEARING THAT THAT HAS BEEN EXHAUSTED AT THAT POINT. AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO ADOPT THOSE POLICIES WITH THAT I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ON THE BILL BUT THANK YOU FOR FOR BRING IT FORWARD. BY THAT THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. IT. MAY I RESPOND A LITTLE SURE YOU GIVE ALL THE ORDERS WITH DISTRICT PERSPECTIVE. YEAH SO -- SOME OF THE RIVER ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM MY SPECIAL DISTRICTS IS IS IS THAT THAT THEY HAVE ADOPTED. POLICIES AND WHAT'S THE WHAT'S HAPPENING IS WE'RE HAVING A POLICY AT ONE DISTRICT IN THAT POLICIES SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT THAN THE POLICY THAT IS AT ANOTHER DISTRICT WHICH IS WHAT WHAT I BELIEVE THE THE LEASE CITIES WAS SAYING IS THAT. THEY'RE THEY HAVE LOOKED AT THIS THEY HAVE THEIR THEIR COUNCILS LOOK AT AND THEY'VE ADOPTED POLICIES FOR THEIR CITY. AND IN ONE CITY IS VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM ANOTHER CITY AND THEY'RE THEY'RE OPERATING UNDER DIFFERENT RULES BUT THEY'RE FOLLOWING THE LAW THE FOLLOWING THE RULES AS THEY INTERPRET IT. BUT THEIR INTERPRETATION IS SO DIFFERENT THAT THEY'RE THAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR THE GUIDANCE SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING -- ON THE THE BACK BAND THROUGH THEIR RIGHT WE HAD A DIFFERENT JURISDICTION HAVING DIFFERENT RULES ON ON WHAT WAS ALLOWED WHAT WASN'T -- AND THE THE GOOD THE THE INDUSTRY CAME AND SAID HEY LOOK. WE RATHER JUST HAVE ONE POLICY SO THAT WE KNOW PROVIDED THE GUIDES AND THAT'S WHERE WE'REAT AT THIS POINT WE HAVE POLICIES AT AT THAT VARYING AGENCIES. WE'RE LOOKING FOR ONE THE CLARITY SO THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE. YOU KNOW THE SIMILAR POLICY THROUGHOUT THE STATE BUT ISN'T THAT THE THE NUCLEUS OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO BE ABLE TO DISAGREE OR HAVE DIFFERENT POLICIES ON DIFFERENT THINGS HOW THEY'RE IMPLEMENTING A COMPLYING WITH LAW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE YES SOME OF ROOM YEAH -- LIKE TO WEIGH IN ON THIS TOO I I I I CERTAINLY THINK THERE'S ALWAYS A GOOD ARGUMENT TO BE MADE FOR LOCAL CONTROL -- BUT THERE'S ALSO I THINK A REALLY IMPORTANT ARGUMENT TO BE MADE HERE FOR UNIFORMITY IN IN OUR LAWS THE THE BROWN ACT AS A STATE LAW. THAT APPLIES EQUALLY TO ALL JURISDICTIONS AND THE BETTER THE UNIFORMITY OF UNDERSTANDING OF THAT LAW IS AND THE MORE EVENLY IT'S APPLIED. THEN THE EASIER IT IS FOR INDIVIDUAL COUNCIL MEMBERS -- TO KNOW WHAT'S RIGHT AND WRONG IT'S TIME YOU KNOW YOU AND YOUR AGENCIES IN THE LEAGUE OF CITIES -- TEACH OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS -- IT WOULD BE IF IT MAKES IT HARDER IN MY VIEW -- FOR A OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT MEMBERS TO TO DO THEIR JOBS AND UNDERSTAND THAT IN DOING THEIR JOB. THERE ARE OF THEY'RE NOT VIOLATING THE LOT NOBODY. I HOPE WANTS TO KNOWINGLY VIOLATE LAWS LIKE THIS -- AND HAVING AN UNDERSTANDING OF THEM IS IS CRITICAL ESPECIALLY IN A INCREASINGLY COMPLICATED WORLD THAT WE COMMUNICATE AND SO I I DO THINK THERE'S WORK TO BE DONE ON THIS BILL BUT I I THINK IT'S WORTHY OF MOVING FORWARD. SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO IT AT ACHIEVE THAT -- THAT GOAL OF HAVING A UNIFORM UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE LAW IS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER BURNER OR BAR THANK YOU I MOVE THE BILL. WE HAVE A MOTION. AND WE HAVE A SECOND. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- I JUST WANT -- TO TRIED TO ASSURE HER ASSEMBLY MEMBER RAMOS -- DAD THIS IS SOMETHING THAT LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE ASKING -- FOR BY ITS VERY NATURE OF BROWN ACT IS STATEWIDE POLICY THEY ARE ASKING FOR A STATEWIDE -- INTERVENTION SO TO SPEAK ON THIS -- I'M NOT PRESENTING A FINISHED PRODUCT TO YOU. UP MY HESITATION IS IF IF WE PUT THIS UP FOR A VOTE WE WIND UP ONE VOTE SHORT. ESSENTIALLY THIS CONVERSATION IS DEAD FOR THE YEAR. AND WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT WE ARE VERY CLOSE AT LEAST IN MY MIND WERE CLOSE TO GETTING SOMETHING THAT'S WORKABLE. WITH A FULL COMMITMENT TO SIT WITH THE NEWSPAPER PUBLISHERS AND WORK THROUGH SOME OF THOSE ISSUES I THINK UNDERLYING THIS IS AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT -- YOU KNOW BY ITS VERY NATURE SOCIAL MEDIA INTERACTIONS ARE PUBLIC ONES. AND WE WANT TO FACILITATE -- OPEN COMMUNICATION WITH THE PUBLIC AND THE IN MY WAY OF THINKING THIS IS IN FURTHERANCE OF THE GOALS OF THE BROWN ACT WITH REGARD TO OPEN GOVERNMENT. IT TO SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR QUESTION AROUND HAVE WE EXHAUSTED ALL LOCAL APPROACHES -- I I GUESS OF A PLANNED WORDS I THINK LOCAL OFFICIALS ARE EXHAUSTED AT TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO COMPLY WITH THIS. SO IT'S OUR RESPONSIBILITY I BELIEVE TO PROVIDE A STATEWIDE APPROACH THAT GIVES SOME CERTAINTY TO LOCAL OFFICIALS SO -- I WOULD LOVE TO GET IT THROUGH -- THIS COMMITTEE TODAY WITH THE ASSURANCE THAT -- I WILL ENGAGE WITH ALL INTERESTED PARTIES YOURSELF INCLUDED MISTER RAMOS. OUGHT TO TO ADDRESS ANY OUTSTANDING CONCERNS AND SIT WITH OPPOSITION I REALLY HAMMER OUT. A WORKABLE -- PLAN GOING FORWARD FOR FOR OUR LOCAL OFFICIALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT ON THAT. AND WITH THAT MADAM CHAIR -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY VOTES WE CAN BRING THE BROWN ACT INTO THE DIGITAL AGE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- YOU KNOW I'M SITTING HERE LISTENING TO BOTH SIDES OF THIS AND I HAVE SO MANY THOUGHTS -- YES AS A LOCAL OFFICIAL WE HAVE. GUIDELINES IN THE BROWN ACT WAS THERE TO PROTECT OUR CONSTITUENTS. AND I THINK THAT'S A PIECE THE WERE MISSING WERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION -- QUITE FRANKLY IT FUNDAMENTALLY I'M NOT WITH YOU ON THIS TODAY AND I WISH I WAS I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT. MAKING SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS ACCESS OR HAS -- THE REMOTE TO BE TRUTHFUL AND HONEST TO OUR CONSTITUENTS I MEAN THE BROWN ACTS THERE FOR A REASON RIGHT. AND I JUST THINK FUNDAMENTALLY THAT THIS IS NOT READY AT ALL -- BUT I THINK THAT NEXT YEAR LET'S WORK ON IT AND I'LL BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO HELP OUT -- SO THAT'LL BE VOTING NO TODAY. THE MOTION IS TO PASS AGUIAR-CURRY. AGUIAR-CURRY NO LACKEY. LACKEY NOT VOTING BLOOM. BLOOM I BRING HER OF THAT. BOERNER HORVATH I RAMOS. RAMOS SNOW THREE OF US. THREE OF US SIRE ROBERT REAVIS.

ITEM NUMBER TWO AB SEVEN OF SEVEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS AB SEVEN OH SEVEN INCREASES VALUE WATERS COST THRESHOLD ABOVE WHICH A FORMAL BIDDING PROCESS REQUIRED. AUTHORIZES THE AGENCIES ELECTED BOARD INCREASE THE THRESHOLD BY OPEN PUBLIC MEETING TO KEEP UP WITH INFLATION. DALY WATERS FORMAL BIDDING THRESHOLD WAS LAST UPDATED BY SB EIGHTEEN SIXTY IN NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AGO. SINCE THAT TIME INFLATION AS A BLOW TO THE PURCHASING POWER OF THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD TO THE EXTENT THAT EVEN SIMPLE PROJECTS. SUCH AS ERECTING A FENCE ARE STILL INSTALLING A WAREHOUSE GARAGE DOOR. REQUIRES A FORMAL BIDDING PROCESS WHICH CAN COST MORE THAN THE ACTUAL PROJECT. AB SEVEN OH SEVEN WOULD ALLOW THE SMALL PROJECTS TO BE SUBJECT TO AN INFORMAL BIDDING PROCESS IN WHICH QUOTES ARE SOLICITED FROM KNOWN RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS. AND THE PROJECTS ARE AWARDED TO THE ONE MOST SUITED TO DO THE WORK. INFORMAL BUT IS NOT ONLY LESS COSTLY SAVING SCARES REPAIR AND TAX DOLLARS IT IS ALSO LESS TIME CONSUMING. THESE MINOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON PUBLIC SAFETY BY AFFECTING WATER SUPPLY AND FLOOD CONTROL INFRASTRUCTURE FOR THE TWO MILLION PEOPLE IT SUPPLIES. MANY PUBLIC AGENCIES ALREADY HAVE HIGHER FORMAL BIDDING THRESHOLDS JUST LAST YEAR AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY SEVEN BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER MAYES INCREASED COMPETITIVE BIDDING THRESHOLD OF FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY PARK AN OPEN SPACE DISTRICT IN THE STATE. ALLOWS THE GOVERNING BOARD TO INCREASE THE THRESHOLD BUT 2% PER YEAR. INFORMAL BIDDING IS ALSO MORE WORKABLE FOR WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES WHICH ARE OFTEN SMALLER COMPANIES THAT LACK THE STAFF RESOURCES TO PURSUE PROJECTS TO THE FORMAL BIDDING PROCESS. THEY NEED ONLY REGISTER WITH THE STATE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS COMPLY WITH PREVAILING WAGE LAW AND SUBMIT AN INFORMAL BIT. IN RESPONSE THE OPPOSITION'S REQUEST THAT VALUE WATER JOIN CUT CASA DEL WATER. HAS EXPLORED THIS OPTION WITH KAFKA. DID DELAYS IN PROCEDURES ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AND SHIFTING FROM ELECTED BOARD AN APPOINTED BOARD. DIE WATER CONCLUDED THAT CUT BECAUSE OF THE RIGHT CHOICE -- NOT ADDRESS THE ISSUES RAISED BY THIS BILL. IT IS WORTH NOTING THE COUPLE HAS A TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR THRESHOLD FOR FORMAL BILLET BIDDING. AND AB SO SEVEN OH SEVEN ONLY RESPECT AYE WATERS. FIFTY THOUSAND I APPRECIATE WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR BRINGING THEIR CONCERNS TO ME AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO HAVE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM -- AS LONG WITH THE SPONSORS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. WITH THE PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONIES RACHEL GIPSON SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT AND REGIONAL SLOWLY WITH THE MINORITY BUSINESS CONSORTIUM. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS RACHEL GIPSON VICTOR GOVERNOR FAIRS FOR THE SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT KNOWN AS VALLEY WATER WE'RE SPECIAL DISTRICT AS THE WATER SUPPLY FLOOD PROTECTION AND IT BERMAN OF STEWARDSHIP. AGENCY FOR THE TWO MILLION PEOPLE OF SANTA CLARA COUNTY THOUSANDS OF SILICON VALLEY JOB PRETTY BUSY BUSINESSES EIGHTY SEVEN OH SEVEN SIMPLY ALLOWS OUR THRESHOLD FOR FORMAL BIG CONTRACTING KEEP UP WITH INFLATION OF 2% PER YEAR. AND SET THE THRESHOLD TO THE SAME LITTLE AFFORDED TO EVERY PARK IN OPEN SPACE DISTRICT IN THE STATE. OVER TIME OF COURSE INFLATION HAS REDUCE THAT VALUE FOR PAROLE BID THRESHOLD SUCH THAT MINOR PROJECTS FOR A FULL BLOWN SEALED BID PROCESS COMPLETE WITH AND YOUR DRAWINGS PLAN SPECS FROM PRESENTATIONS ETCETERA COSTING FAR MORE THAN THE PROJECT ITSELF. VALLEY WATER SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE THE INFORMAL BID PROCESS FOR MINOR PUBLIC WORKS REQUIRED BY OUR ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THAT POLICY REQUIRES MULTIPLE BIDS FROM RESPONSIBLE BIDDERS AND THE LOWEST RESPONSIVE BIDDER IS AWARDED THE JOB. IT ALSO MAKES IT EASIER FOR SMALL BUSINESSES INCLUDING WOMEN AND MINORITY OWNED BUSINESSES. TODAY YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION ARE CONTRACTING THRESHOLD SHOULD REMAIN FROZEN AT THE NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT LEVEL IT PROJECT CURRENTLY REST UNTIL ITS PURCHASING POWER IS SO ERODED BY INFLATION WE HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO PARTICIPATE IN CUT CUT. WELL THAT STATUE GIVES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE OPTION YOU THE HIGHER BIDDING PERSONAL ALSO RECORDS IN PERSON BY STATE APPOINTED COMMISSION REQUIRED TO MEET ONLY ONCE PER YEAR. WE REVIEWED KAFKA AND WE DO HAVE SERIOUS CONCERNS OUR WATER SUPPLY AND FLOOD PROTECTION PRODUCTS OFTEN REQUIRE WORK TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERMIT WINDOW. SOMETIMES A SHORT AS A FEW WEEKS TO ACCOMMODATE NESTING BIRDS MIGRATING FISH AND OTHER SENSITIVE SPECIES IF THERE WERE PROCESS APPEAL WE'RE VERY CONCERNED THE STATE APPOINTED COMMISSION WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO PROPERLY INVESTIGATED AND CAN BE SPECIAL MEETINGS TO JUDICATA. IN TIME FOR FLOOD CONTROL COMPANY TO BE COMPLETED WITHIN THAT NARROW PERMIT WINDOW. BUT I ASSURE YOU ARE ELECTED BOARD OF DIRECTORS WHAT IN ORDER TO PREVENT THE LIFE SAFETY RISK. TO OUR COMMUNITIES DURING THE COMING RAINY SEASONS WHILE VALLEY WATERS OPEN RECONSIDERING PARTICIPATION CUP IN THE FUTURE OUR AGENCY HAS DETERMINED THAT CONVERTING TO IT. RIGHT NOW WOULD NOT APPROVE FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND MAY DELAY LIKE SAFETY PROJECTS WHEN LEGISLATURE ENACTED CUT GOOD GIVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THE OPTIONS WHICH OPTION TO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE. IT DID NOT INTENDED OTHER CONTRACTING MECHANISMS BE FROZEN UNTIL INFLATION FORCES EVERY JURISDICTION IN A CUP CUP. AGENCIES NEED THE OPTION TO CHOOSE THE CONTRACTING TOOL IN OUR TOOLBOX THAT'S BEST FOR THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES. MANAGER MEMBERS I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT EIGHTY SEVEN OH SEVEN TO ENSURE THE EFFICIENT EFFECTIVE LOCALLY CONTROLLED CONTRACTING CONTINUES TO SERVE THE WATER SUPPLY FLOOD PROTECTION ENVIRONMENTAL STEWARDSHIP NEEDS OF SILICON VALLEY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS IN SUPPORT IF COM MY NAME IS REGINALD SWILLY I'M A FOUNDER AND OF PRINCIPLE THAT MINORITY BUSINESS CONSORTIUM. AND MY NOTED BUSY BUSINESS EXPLORES CONSORTIUM EXIST TO HELP WOMEN AND MINORITY CONTRACTORS PREVIOUSLY ON ENGAGE BUSINESS COMMUNITIES HAVE ACCESS. TO CONTRACT IMPOSSIBILITIES IN MAJOR CONT -- CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS AND PROCUREMENT OF THE PROCUREMENT PROCESS IS -- WE ARE WORKING WITH THE VALUE WATER -- SANTA CLARA VALLEY WATER DISTRICT BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING WITH THEM ABOUT OPENING UP THIS PROCESS SO OTHER CONTRACTORS CAN BE AVAILABLE WE HAVE VERY A BIFURCATED. CONTRACTING WORLD THAT WE LIVE HERE AND THIS BIFURCATED AWAY WHERE THEY'RE A BIG COMPANIES THAT GET THEIR ANYTHING THAT WE HAVE NO INFRASTRUCTURE FOR NEW COMPANIES GUYS COMING OUT OF COLLEGE -- OR LABORERS THAT WANT TO START THEIR OWN BUSINESS NOW I NOTICED THAT -- A A GROUP OF LABORERS ARE. OPPOSING THIS WE KNOW WE HAVE. OF A PARTICULAR. BUSINESS CLIMATE NOW FOR PEOPLE ALL SUBSERVIENT TO THE LARGER COMPANIES BECAUSE THEY CAN NEVER BREAK OUT. BECAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO START A NEW BUSINESS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THESE CONTRACTS THAT THAT THESE MAJOR COMPANIES ARE GETTING FROM IT WE ARE A MINORITY BUSINESS CONSORTIUM HAD A CONTRACT WITH THE FORTY NINES NEW STADIUM. AND WE HELP MOVE FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FROM COMPANIES WHO WOULD HAVE WATER NEARLY HAD THOSE CONTRACTS TO NEW CONTRACTORS NO WE THINK THAT THE THE TECH INDUSTRY IS BOOMING WITH INNOVATION. SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S WIDE OPEN AND AND WE FEEL THAT BECOMES THE WHOLE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY HAVE CLAMPED DOWN ON THIS ON THIS INDUSTRY SO THAT WE CAN GET NEW COMPANIES AND WE CAN'T GET NEW INNOVATION WE CAN'T GET GUYS COMING OUT A CUP COMING OUT OF COLLEGE. THAT CAN COME INTO A PROCESS WHERE THEY CAN GET EASILY EASY CONTRACTS LIKE THIS SO THAT THEY COULD BUILD THE COMPANY FROM NOTHING TO SOMETHING. AND WE HAVE MANY OMPANIES STUCK IN. VERY SMALL -- POOL OF WE HAVE A REALLY SMALL CONTRACTS AND WE THINK THAT WHAT THE WATER DISTRICT IS TRYING TO DO IS OPEN IT UP EVEN MORE AND I'LL CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM. I REALLY THINK THE FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLAR LIMIT IS REALLY WEAK RIGHT. BUT I THINK IT IS THE LEAST THAT YOU CAN DO AT SOUTH STATE LEGISLATORS WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO WITH CAPITALISM THE WAY IT IS RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE ANY BIG ELECTRICAL COMPANY IS NOT GOING TO LET ME START ELECTRICAL COMPANY AND COMPETE AGAINST THEM. AND CAPITALISM SAY HIS POWER CAN AFFECT YOU MORE THAN MOUNTAINS THAT THAT THEN MY GOOD ORK AND MY INNOVATION AND MY INNOVATION WILL DIE ON THE VINE. AND I THINK US IN HIS WORK WITH LABOR AND I HAVE WORKED WITH HIM OVER AND OVER -- FOR MANY YEARS NOW AND HIS WORK WITH US TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN OPEN THESE AT THE THE PROCESS OF FOUR WOMEN AND MINORITY BUSINESS FOR VETERAN BUSINESS WITH THIS ADVANTAGE ABOUT VITAMIN BUSINESSES. FOR THE LGBT OF BUSINESS COMMUNITY THERE ARE BUSINESS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE REALLY OUTSIDE OF THE OF THOSE -- HOLE CONTRACTING POOL HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IT EXISTS EVERYWHERE IN EVERY COUNTY AND IN THIS WHOLE STATE WE THINK THAT DO YOU. BY GOING IN THIS DIRECTION WE'LL BE MAKING A SMALL STEP THAT WOULD ENCOURAGE US THAT AS WE TRY TO DEVELOP SOME OF THE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WE TRY TO BRING ACCESS TO THEM. THAT THIS WILL BE SOMETHING THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS MOVING FORWARD. WE SUPPORT THIS WE THINK THIS -- AND WE SUPPORT IT WHOLEHEARTEDLY BUT WE THINK IT'S REALLY SMALL. AND IF YOU COULD BUILD IN A WAY FOR TODAY BY. I THINK I GOT IT. OTHERS IN US SUPPORT. AND I'LL BUT RATHER WITH CREW STRATEGIES ON BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SAN JOSE IN STRONG SUPPORT.

THE THE STRUCTURE OF THE BILL AS WE READ IT -- SEVERELY DIMINISHES OPPORTUNITIES FOR PUBLIC WORKS CONTRACTORS TO BID ON PROJECTS -- FROM THE DISTRICT -- THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ADDRESSED THIS ISSUE GLOBALLY WHEN IT CREATED THE UNIFORM PUBLIC CONSTRUCTION COST ACCOUNTING ACT -- WHEN THEY CREATED THAT ACT THE LEGISLATURE WAS ATTEMPTING TO STOP CONSTERNATION IN THE LEGISLATURE -- ON THESE FORCE ACCOUNT ISSUES AND WHAT THEY DID IS THEY CREATED A PROVISION OF LAW THAT WOUD ALLOW PUBLIC AGENCIES TO OPT IN ON A VOLUNTARY BASIS BY ORDINANCE OF THEIR LOW -- OPERATING BOARDS. AND HAVE A MUCH GREATER -- A MUCH GREATER -- FLEXIBILITY FOR IT NOT ONLY BIT THRESHOLDS BUT FOR WORK THEY COULD DO IN HOUSE. AND ALSO INFORMAL BID. THE REQUESTED BY THE DISTRICT THAT IS BEING A PLACE IN THIS -- THIS BILL IS LESS THAN WHAT WOULD BE PROVIDED TO THEM IF THEY OPTED INTO THE ACT OVER TWELVE HUNDRED AGENCIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE PTED IN TO YOU FROM PUBLIC DESTRUCTION COST ACCOUNTING ACT. THEY THE HAVE -- I BELIEVE IF YOU WOULD POOR TO REACH OUT TO ANY ONE OF THEM THEY WOULD ALL SEEING THE BENEFITS AND IT. PROBABLY EDUCATE YOU ON HOW NOT COMPLICATED IT HAS TO OPERATE WITHIN THE ACTING USE THE ACT -- THAT BEING SAID.
