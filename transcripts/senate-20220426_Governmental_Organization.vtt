00:43:11.822 --> 00:43:14.224
UP THEY HAVE TO TAKE THAT -- OR

00:43:14.291 --> 00:43:15.759
IF IF THERE'S A DETERMINATION

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.594
MADE THAT THAT THE COMPANY WAS

00:43:17.661 --> 00:43:19.096
THE ONLY ONE THAT COULD FULFILL

00:43:19.163 --> 00:43:20.297
THE CONTRACT THERE ARE CASES

00:43:20.364 --> 00:43:22.533
LIKE THAT THEN AGAIN THEY SHOULD

00:43:22.599 --> 00:43:23.600
BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN NO BID

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.202
CONTRACT IN THAT CASE EVEN IF

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:26.937
THEY GAVE BEHALF PAYMENT BECAUSE

00:43:27.171 --> 00:43:28.706
THEY WOULD BE THE ONLY OPTION

00:43:28.973 --> 00:43:31.241
WHAT WE BELIEVE THOSE OF MEN

00:43:31.308 --> 00:43:33.744
SHOULD BE SHOULD BE MADE UP BUT

00:43:33.811 --> 00:43:35.546
WE THINK THE CORE OF THE BILL

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:36.880
SAY THAT IF THERE ARE OTHER

00:43:36.947 --> 00:43:38.048

COMPETITIVE PROCESS OR OR NOT

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:42.953
THAT IN THOSE CASES THE --

00:43:43.787 --> 00:43:44.722
NO BID CONTRACTS SHOULD NOT

00:43:44.788 --> 00:43:46.657

EXPERTISE THE NECESSITY THE

00:43:52.963 --> 00:43:55.432

IN THE BACKGROUND AND HISTORY

00:44:00.671 --> 00:44:02.740
OF THE BETTER THAT CORRECT

00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:08.045
IF IF THERE WERE NOT OTHER

00:44:10.047 --> 00:44:11.081
IT WOULD NOT TAKE EFFECT RIGHT

00:44:11.148 --> 00:44:12.683
TO IT IF IF IF THERE WAS A

THE NO BID CONTRACT THEY WERE

00:44:24.995 --> 00:44:27.231
THE BEST OPTION IN THAT CASE WE

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:28.465
JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE

00:44:28.532 --> 00:44:30.467
WILL THAT OTHER OP IT SHOULD

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:32.169

00:44:37.141 --> 00:44:38.742
MORE CONFIDENCE IN THE PROCESS

00:44:38.809 --> 00:44:40.811

MAKE IT AT SECURE TRUST TO BOOK

00:44:47.418 --> 00:44:48.986

THIS BILL AS IT'S WRITTEN

00:46:40.898 --> 00:46:42.866

ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THESE CHOICES

00:47:09.226 --> 00:47:11.862
-- AND I WOULD SAY THAT THAT

00:47:11.929 --> 00:47:12.763
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'VE

00:47:12.829 --> 00:47:14.064
LEARNED THROUGH THIS PROCESS

00:47:14.131 --> 00:47:15.866
WITH THIS EMERGENCY AND AS THIS

00:47:15.933 --> 00:47:17.568
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT THERE

00:47:17.634 --> 00:47:19.903
HAS BEEN ACCOUNTABILITY HOUSE

00:47:19.970 --> 00:47:22.239
UP WELL WE AS THE LEGISLATURE

00:47:24.675 --> 00:47:27.477
-- FOR THESE BIDS TO BE PAID

00:47:28.111 --> 00:47:29.546
SO THERE IS A CHECK WITHIN THE

00:47:29.613 --> 00:47:31.114
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS FOR THOSE

00:47:31.181 --> 00:47:34.151
CHOICES I NUMBER TWO

GOVERNOR WAS SUBJECT TO RECALL

00:47:37.588 --> 00:47:39.189
FOR HOW HE CONDUCTED HIMSELF

00:47:39.256 --> 00:47:41.325
DURING THIS PANDEMIC AND WE

00:47:41.391 --> 00:47:42.559
KNOW THE RESULTS OF THAT BUT

00:47:42.626 --> 00:47:43.860
THAT WAS AN ACCOUNTABILITY

00:47:44.127 --> 00:47:46.096
TEST FOR THE DECISIONS HE MADE

00:47:46.163 --> 00:47:48.298
IN THIS EMERGENCY AND FINALLY

00:47:48.365 --> 00:47:49.433
HE'S GOING TO BE ON THE BALLOT

00:47:49.499 --> 00:47:51.768
AND AND JUST A FEW WEEKS --

00:47:52.035 --> 00:47:53.270

00:47:57.441 --> 00:47:59.209
LIKE TO SEE THIS TYPE OF OF OF

00:47:59.276 --> 00:48:01.511
CLOSE LINKAGE BETWEEN OF THE HAS

00:48:01.578 --> 00:48:03.614
THE PAYMENT AT A NO BID CONTRACT

00:48:03.680 --> 00:48:06.083
NOW NO BUT IF THE BILL BEFORE

00:48:06.149 --> 00:48:08.285
US TODAY SAID LET'S ELIMINATE

00:48:08.352 --> 00:48:10.454
THE HAS TO PAYMENTS OKAY WELL

00:48:10.520 --> 00:48:11.888
I'M INTERESTED IN MAYBE SUPPORT

00:48:11.955 --> 00:48:13.557
A BILL LIKE THAT LET'S ELIMINATE

00:48:13.624 --> 00:48:15.225
THE HAS TO PAYMENTS IF WE THINK

00:48:15.292 --> 00:48:17.127
THAT'S THE CORROSIVE EFFECT NOW

00:48:17.427 --> 00:48:18.528
THERE'S A LOT OF DOWNSIDES TO

00:48:18.595 --> 00:48:20.030
THAT TO IN TERMS OF THE CHARITY

00:48:20.097 --> 00:48:21.865
WORK THAT'S DONE BY PEOPLE

00:48:21.932 --> 00:48:24.301
AND AND AND AND AND I ENTITIES

00:48:24.701 --> 00:48:26.069
THAT WE HAVE BENEFITTED FROM

00:48:26.136 --> 00:48:27.537
CERTAINLY DURING THIS PANDEMIC

00:48:27.604 --> 00:48:29.273
AND DURING THIS EMERGENCY AND

00:48:29.339 --> 00:48:30.874
THE RECORD COULD REFLECT A LOT

00:48:30.941 --> 00:48:32.542
OF THOSE CONTRIBUTIONS WHAT

00:48:32.609 --> 00:48:33.877
THEY ARE AND WHERE THEY HAVE

00:48:33.944 --> 00:48:35.212
GONE BECAUSE IT'S ALL PART

00:48:35.279 --> 00:48:37.014
OF THE PUBLIC RECORD PART OF

00:48:37.080 --> 00:48:38.181
THE STANDARDS FOR THE HAS TO

00:48:38.248 --> 00:48:39.583
PAYMENT IS THAT YOU HAVE TO

00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.418
REPORT IT WOULD THEN NOT SIX

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:42.953
MONTHS NOT THREE MONTHS BUT

00:48:43.020 --> 00:48:45.055
THIRTY DAYS SO ONCE AGAIN THERE

00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:46.423
IS SOME TRANSPARENCY IN THIS

00:48:46.490 --> 00:48:48.225
SPACE DOES IT MEAN THAT WE'VE

00:48:48.292 --> 00:48:50.761
ELIMINATED THE CLOSE THE

00:48:50.827 --> 00:48:52.462

TRIES TO GET TO THAT SPACE

00:48:58.201 --> 00:48:59.403
BUT I THINK IT'S BECAUSE OF

00:48:59.469 --> 00:49:00.871
THE FACT THAT IT'S AN EMERGENCY

00:49:00.937 --> 00:49:02.139
THAT MAKES ME GIVE PAUSE I'D

00:51:51.408 --> 00:51:53.143
THE DISCUSSION ON THESE POINTS

00:51:53.410 --> 00:51:55.011
OBVIOUSLY I'M DISADVANTAGED

00:51:55.078 --> 00:51:57.080
-- THIS NOT BEING MY BILL --

00:51:57.147 --> 00:51:58.381
IN NOT HAVING -- THE INTIMATE

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.550
KNOWLEDGE OF THE INTENT OF THE

00:52:00.617 --> 00:52:02.752
AUTHOR SO -- I HOPE I DON'T

00:52:02.819 --> 00:52:05.188
OVERSTEP MYSELF -- BY SAYING THE

00:52:05.255 --> 00:52:07.891
FOLLOWING I THINK WHAT IS

00:52:07.958 --> 00:52:09.659
THE AUTHOR IS TRYING TO DO HERE

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.929
IS -- INJECT -- HIGHER

00:52:12.996 --> 00:52:15.732
LEVEL OF TRANSPARENCY AND

00:52:15.799 --> 00:52:17.534
CREDIBILITY TO THE PROCESS

00:52:18.134 --> 00:52:19.302
WE KNOW THAT IN TWENTY TWENTY

00:52:19.369 --> 00:52:20.670
IN THE MIDST OF THE PANDEMIC

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:22.205
I DURING THE DECLARED STATE

00:52:22.272 --> 00:52:23.707
OF EMERGENCY BASS PAYMENTS

00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:25.642
PROBABLY USE FOR THE BETTERMENT

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:27.410
OF COMMUNITIES THE BETTERMENT

00:52:27.477 --> 00:52:28.979
OF THE STATE'S AND IT'S ABOUT

00:52:29.045 --> 00:52:30.313
THE STATE AND ITS RESIDENTS

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:31.882
SO I THINK I DON'T THINK WE

00:52:31.948 --> 00:52:34.184
SHOULD FOCUS TOO MUCH ON THE

00:52:34.251 --> 00:52:36.887
STATE OF EMERGENCY AS

00:52:36.953 --> 00:52:38.889
-- THE BASELINE FOR A BILL LIKE

00:52:38.955 --> 00:52:40.557
THIS GETTING TO SENATOR GLAZERS

00:52:40.624 --> 00:52:43.293
POINT THAT THIS ACTUALLY

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:46.196
CAN BEING A BENEFICIAL PROCESS

00:52:46.530 --> 00:52:48.899
THAT ENCOURAGES FOLKS TO STILL

00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:51.401
ODD -- DIRECT PHILANTHROPIC OR

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:54.104
CHARITABLE DOLLARS TO DESIGNATED

00:52:54.170 --> 00:52:56.006
-- BENEFICIARIES BECAUSE WE

00:52:56.072 --> 00:52:57.340
ALL BENEFIT FROM THAT FROM

00:52:57.407 --> 00:52:58.909
THAT PROCESS WHICH WANT TO

00:52:58.975 --> 00:53:01.478
DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT

00:53:01.845 --> 00:53:04.314
CONFLATE THE BIDDING PROCESS

00:53:04.381 --> 00:53:05.815
WITH THE CHARITABLE DONATION

00:53:06.249 --> 00:53:07.384
AND SO I THINK WHAT I HEARD

00:53:07.450 --> 00:53:08.852
FROM CENTER GLAZER AND OTHERS

00:53:08.919 --> 00:53:10.587
IS THAT THIS WAS A UNIQUE MOMENT

00:53:10.654 --> 00:53:11.888
IN TIME DURING THE DECLARE STATE

00:53:11.955 --> 00:53:14.157
OF EMERGENCY AND I WOULD

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:16.059
VENTURE TO SAY THAT THE AUTHOR

00:53:19.462 --> 00:53:21.798
ON ADDITIONAL MODIFICATIONS

00:53:21.865 --> 00:53:23.767
TO THIS BILL TO ALLEVIATE SOME

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.735
OF THOSE CONCERNS BUT AS WE ALL

00:53:25.802 --> 00:53:28.004
KNOW THAT A BILL LIKE THIS CAN'T

00:53:28.071 --> 00:53:30.640
STOP OR DIES AND I AND

00:53:30.707 --> 00:53:31.875

ON THE EMERGENCY CALCULATION

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:40.650
BECAUSE IF THERE IS A DECLARE

00:53:40.717 --> 00:53:42.285
STATE OF EMERGENCY MAYBE THERE

00:53:42.352 --> 00:53:43.987
NEEDS TO BE FLEXIBILITY MORE

00:53:44.054 --> 00:53:45.221
FLEXIBILITY INHERENT IN THE

00:53:45.288 --> 00:53:46.890
PROCESS BUT OUTSIDE OF THOSE

00:53:46.957 --> 00:53:49.926
UNIQUE I AND -- EXISTENCE

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:51.628
CIRCUMSTANCES MAYBE WE NEED

00:53:51.695 --> 00:53:53.730
TO HAVE A MORE TRANSPARENT

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.732
IN BASELINE APPROACH SO IN

00:53:55.799 --> 00:53:57.701

IS FAR FETCHED AND I'M NOT

01:20:40.402 --> 01:20:41.903
TRYING TO BE ARGUMENTATIVE

01:20:41.970 --> 01:20:43.004

ABOUT COMMON SENSE HERE TODAY

01:20:46.308 --> 01:20:48.210
BOTTOM LINE IS THIS BEER IS

01:20:48.276 --> 01:20:50.011
TOO HEAVY TO SHIP BY MAIL TO

01:20:50.078 --> 01:20:51.980
EVER BE COMPETITIVE RIGHTFULLY

01:20:52.047 --> 01:20:53.381
SO WITH DISTRIBUTORS HERE IN

01:20:53.448 --> 01:20:55.250
THE GOLDEN STATE WE'VE ALSO

01:20:55.317 --> 01:20:56.418
HEARD THAT THIS BILL CREATES

01:20:56.484 --> 01:20:58.119
AN UNREGULATED MARKET THIS

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.955
BILL DOESN'T AS I MENTIONED

01:21:00.021 --> 01:21:01.790
EARLIER IT REQUIRES OUT OF STATE

01:21:01.856 --> 01:21:03.491
PERMIT HOLDERS COMPLY WITH ALL

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:05.327
THE A. B. C. RULES COLLECTING

01:21:05.393 --> 01:21:07.362
REMIXED A STATE SALES AND EXCISE

01:21:07.429 --> 01:21:09.231
TAXES AND IT OUTLAWS BRINGING

01:21:09.297 --> 01:21:10.665
ALCOHOL INTO THE STATE WITHOUT

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.000
A PERMIT CREATED BY THE BILL

01:21:12.701 --> 01:21:15.036
SO THIS ISSUE WE FACE THAT IT

01:21:15.103 --> 01:21:16.972
IS INDISPENSABLE PRIVILEGE THAT

01:21:17.038 --> 01:21:18.306
IN STATE BREWERS HAVE TO SHIP

01:21:18.373 --> 01:21:19.608
DIRECTLY CALVET CONSUMERS AND

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:21.343
VULNERABLE IT'S VULNERABLE TO

01:21:21.409 --> 01:21:23.078
A FEDERAL CONSTITUTION ARGUMENT

01:21:23.411 --> 01:21:25.313
IF WE DON'T ALLOW OUT OF STATE

01:21:25.680 --> 01:21:27.816
THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE WE CAN'T

01:21:27.882 --> 01:21:29.851
CODIFIED IN STATE SHIPPING

01:21:29.918 --> 01:21:31.586

01:21:31.653 --> 01:21:33.688
TO COME IN EVEN IF WE DON'T

THAT'S BLOCK IT BUT IT WOULD

01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:40.328
BE CONSTITUTIONALLY A CHALLENGE

01:21:40.395 --> 01:21:41.730

YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL

01:48:09.449 --> 01:48:12.285
FORWARD -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE

01:48:12.352 --> 01:48:14.421
MADE SEVERAL EFFORTS TO

01:48:14.621 --> 01:48:16.156
BRING THIS TO A CLOSE TO MAKE

01:48:16.223 --> 01:48:18.458
SURE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HOLDS

01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:19.960
ITS RIGHTFUL POSITION WITHIN

01:48:20.026 --> 01:48:21.695
THE -- GOVERNMENT A STATE OF

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:23.096
CALIFORNIA MAKING DECISIONS

01:48:23.163 --> 01:48:25.065
WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO DO THAT

01:48:25.131 --> 01:48:27.868
-- SUCCESSFULLY BUT I THINK

01:48:28.668 --> 01:48:30.770
IT MAKES PERFECT SENSE THAT IF

01:48:30.837 --> 01:48:32.405
A STATE OF EMERGENCY IS DECLARED

01:48:32.472 --> 01:48:34.140
WHICH WE ALL WOULD AGREE THAT

01:48:34.207 --> 01:48:36.276
WHEN THIS FIRST TOOK PLACE NO

01:48:36.343 --> 01:48:37.611
WHEN IT WAS OPPOSED TO MAKING

01:48:37.677 --> 01:48:39.813
SURE PEOPLE STAYED SAFE HOWEVER

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.215
WHEN IT GOES SO FAR BEYOND

01:48:42.649 --> 01:48:44.117
THE SCOPE OF WHAT WAS ORIGINALLY

01:48:44.184 --> 01:48:45.185
INTENDED THEN I THINK THE

01:48:45.252 --> 01:48:47.654
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO REIN IT IN

01:48:47.721 --> 01:48:49.689
AND SO FOR THE GOVERNOR TO HAVE

01:48:49.756 --> 01:48:51.191
TO COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE

01:48:51.258 --> 01:48:53.059
AND SAY LOOK I STILL THINK THE

01:48:53.126 --> 01:48:55.362
CONDITIONS EXIST THAT WE NEED TO

01:48:55.428 --> 01:48:57.397
CONTINUE STATE OF EMERGENCY AND

01:48:57.464 --> 01:48:58.798
LAY THAT PLAN OUT AND ALL OF THE

01:48:58.865 --> 01:49:00.433
REASONS WHY THEN THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:00.500 --> 01:49:01.868
CAN CONTEMPLATE THAT AND SAY YOU

01:49:01.935 --> 01:49:03.904
KNOW WE AGREE WITH THAT WE WILL

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:05.205
CONTINUE THE STATE OF EMERGENCY

01:49:05.272 --> 01:49:07.841
OR WE DISAGREE AND WE'RE GOING

01:49:07.908 --> 01:49:09.809
TO HAVE TO CHANGE HOW THINGS ARE

01:49:09.876 --> 01:49:11.611
DONE THAT'S APPROPRIATE THAT'S

01:49:11.678 --> 01:49:12.746
WHAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA

01:49:12.812 --> 01:49:14.781
DESERVE AND WANT AND I THINK

01:49:14.848 --> 01:49:17.050
THAT THIS BILL -- IT SHOULD

01:49:17.117 --> 01:49:17.984

01:49:18.985 --> 01:49:20.086

01:49:20.153 --> 01:49:22.289
THIS COMMITTEE WOULD AGREE THAT

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:23.990
THE LOOK THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.926

THE STAFF ANALYSIS RAISES A

02:09:07.005 --> 02:09:09.441
QUESTION OF -- WHY WE WOULD

02:09:09.508 --> 02:09:11.210
ONLY HAVE THE SUPPLY TO STATES

02:09:11.276 --> 02:09:13.112

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:15.681
STATE COULD YOU ADDRESS THAT

02:09:16.248 --> 02:09:18.517
THAT FLAG WHY ONLY DURING THE

02:09:18.584 --> 02:09:20.018
GET YOUR BILL ONLY DEALS WITH

02:09:20.085 --> 02:09:21.286
THE STATE OF EMERGENCY IS THAT

02:09:21.353 --> 02:09:23.288
RIGHT YES AND I THINK THE REASON

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:24.823
WE'D TAKE THAT POSITION OR

02:09:24.890 --> 02:09:26.258
REGIONALES BECAUSE HE BECAME A

02:09:26.325 --> 02:09:28.160
WHAT WE BECAME AWARE OUR OFFICE

02:09:28.227 --> 02:09:29.561
BECAME AWARE OF THE FACT THAT

02:09:29.895 --> 02:09:31.497
I'M IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS

02:09:31.563 --> 02:09:33.465
DURING THE EMERGENCY SERVICES

02:09:33.832 --> 02:09:36.568
-- AB OR THE STATE OF EMERGENCY

02:09:36.802 --> 02:09:39.037
THERE WAS NO IDENTIFICATION

02:09:39.104 --> 02:09:41.340
-- IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS

02:09:41.406 --> 02:09:42.841
THAT ALLOWED US TO SEE WHICH

02:09:42.908 --> 02:09:44.376
WAY THE COMPANIES WERE LOCATED

02:09:44.676 --> 02:09:46.111
SO WE THOUGHT THAT THAT'S WHERE

02:09:46.178 --> 02:09:48.347
THE PRIMARY CONCERN CAME FROM

02:09:48.413 --> 02:09:49.748
THAT THAT'S RIGHT STEM FROM WAS

02:09:49.815 --> 02:09:51.183
FROM THAT STATE OF EMERGENCY

02:09:51.250 --> 02:09:52.518
AND NOT HAVING THE ABILITY TO
