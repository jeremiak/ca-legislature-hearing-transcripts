NOT THEY COULD CHOOSE NOT TO

THIS DOES NOT MANDATE AN OUTCOME.

00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:47.826

SPECIFICALLY ARE PROPOSED

00:36:23.781 --> 00:36:24.815

INDUSTRY.

00:36:28.619 --> 00:36:29.854

00:36:41.399 --> 00:36:44.368
THAT WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF

00:36:44.435 --> 00:36:45.636
A DELISTING OR DOWN LISTING OF A

00:36:45.703 --> 00:36:47.572
FEDERALLY LISTED SPECIES SUCH AT

00:36:47.638 --> 00:36:49.240
THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION.

CAN LOOK AT THAT DEALERS HERE

00:36:51.108 --> 00:36:52.376
DALLAS SCENE.

00:36:52.443 --> 00:36:53.444
AND ANALYZE WHETHER LISTED UNDER

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:55.346
THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

00:36:55.413 --> 00:36:56.614
CALIFORNIA'S VERSION OF THAT.

00:36:56.681 --> 00:36:58.082
AND WE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS THAT

00:36:58.149 --> 00:36:59.584
PHIL WHAT WE CALL THE GAP WHICH

00:36:59.650 --> 00:37:00.718
IS DURING THAT INTERIM REVIEW

00:37:00.785 --> 00:37:02.353
PROCESS WE'VE OFFERED AMENDMENTS

00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:03.554
THAT WOULD PRESERVE.

00:37:03.621 --> 00:37:05.656
ALL OF THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS

00:37:05.723 --> 00:37:08.259
DURING THAT -- REVIEW PROCESS TO

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.827
ADDRESS ANY CONCERNS THAT DURING

00:37:09.894 --> 00:37:11.128
THE REVIEW THOSE SPECIES WOULD

00:37:11.195 --> 00:37:12.697
NOT BE PROTECTED.

00:37:12.763 --> 00:37:13.431
I WE'VE BEEN HEARING IN EACH

00:37:13.497 --> 00:37:14.632
COMMITTEE THAT WE'VE WENT TO

00:37:14.699 --> 00:37:16.200
THAT THIS IS NOT THE PURVIEW OF

00:37:16.267 --> 00:37:18.002
THEIR JURISDICTION BUT CANDIDLY

00:37:18.069 --> 00:37:19.370
WE'VE TRIED TO BRING THIS INTO

00:37:19.437 --> 00:37:20.571
THE PARKS AND WILDLIFE.

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.473
IT DID NOT GO THERE AND SO WE

00:37:22.540 --> 00:37:23.174
ARE DAY LIGHTING THAT HERE

00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:25.343
BECAUSE FRANKLY THERE'S ONLY TWO

00:37:25.409 --> 00:37:26.911
POLICY COMMITTEES LEFT AND WE

00:37:26.978 --> 00:37:28.946
THINK IT'S A RIGHT ISSUE FOR ANY

00:37:29.013 --> 00:37:30.348
POLICY COMMITTEE AT THIS POINT

00:37:30.414 --> 00:37:31.382
SINCE IT DIDN'T GO TO PARKS

00:37:31.449 --> 00:37:33.017
WILDLIFE AND I'LL DEFER TO

00:37:33.084 --> 00:37:34.352
JENNIFER I'M NOT THANKS.

00:37:34.418 --> 00:37:35.353
HEY GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS

00:37:35.419 --> 00:37:36.520
JENNIFER PAIR AND THE GENERAL

00:37:36.587 --> 00:37:37.855
MANAGER FOR THE STATE WATER

00:37:37.922 --> 00:37:39.991
CONTRACTORS WHICH ARE TWENTY

00:37:40.057 --> 00:37:41.158
SEVEN PUBLIC WATER AGENCIES THAT

00:37:41.225 --> 00:37:43.194
CONTRACT. FOR STATE WATER

00:37:43.260 --> 00:37:45.129
PROJECT WATER -- THERE HAVE BEEN

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:46.797
SOME AMENDMENTS NONE OF THEM SO

00:37:46.864 --> 00:37:48.599
FAR HAVE ADDRESSED ARE --

00:37:48.666 --> 00:37:50.034
CONCERNS AROUND THE ENDANGERED

00:37:50.101 --> 00:37:51.736
SPECIES ACT I WOULD AGREE THE

00:37:51.802 --> 00:37:53.004
INTENT OF THE BILL IS SIMPLE AND

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:54.438
I THINK THAT WE SUPPORT THAT

00:37:54.505 --> 00:37:57.008
SIMPLE INTENT BUT UNFORTUNATELY.

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:59.076
THE BILL HAS THE RAMIFICATIONS

00:37:59.143 --> 00:38:01.746
THE STATE WATER PROJECT -- THAT

00:38:01.812 --> 00:38:03.614
ARE PRETTY DETRIMENTAL TO IT AND

00:38:03.681 --> 00:38:04.849
AND AND THE FOR THAT REASON WE

00:38:04.915 --> 00:38:06.517
ARE REMAIN OPPOSED.

00:38:06.584 --> 00:38:08.152
IT IS -- WOULD ESSENTIALLY

00:38:08.219 --> 00:38:10.554
FREEZE TEN YEAR OLD BIOLOGICAL

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:12.757
OPINIONS IN PLACE.

00:38:12.823 --> 00:38:14.625
IT ALSO EXPANDS WHAT IS

00:38:14.692 --> 00:38:16.127
CURRENTLY SEIZE THE INTO THE

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:17.862
FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT

00:38:17.928 --> 00:38:18.829
BECAUSE THEY HAVE TWO DIFFERENT

00:38:18.896 --> 00:38:20.431
TYPES OF REGULATIONS THEY HAVE

00:38:20.498 --> 00:38:22.133
DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS OF TAKE.

00:38:22.199 --> 00:38:22.800
THEY HAVE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT

00:38:22.867 --> 00:38:23.901
THEY REGULATE THEY HAVE

00:38:23.968 --> 00:38:25.102
DIFFERENT ABILITY TO LIST

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:27.038
SPECIES AND SO WE ARE TO REMAIN.

00:38:27.104 --> 00:38:28.572
CONFUSED AND CONCERNED ABOUT

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:30.074
EXACTLY HOW THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:38:30.141 --> 00:38:31.742
FISH WILDLIFE WOULD ACTUALLY

00:38:31.809 --> 00:38:35.012
TRANSLATE FEDERAL ESA INTO STATE.

00:38:35.079 --> 00:38:36.047
SEES -- WITHOUT ACTUALLY

00:38:36.113 --> 00:38:39.417
EXPANDING THE INTENT AND AND

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:40.818
STATUE OF SEES THAT SELF.

00:38:40.885 --> 00:38:41.952
THE STATE WATER CONTRACTORS

00:38:42.019 --> 00:38:43.421
INVEST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:38:43.487 --> 00:38:44.555
ANNUALLY IN SCIENCE TO TRY TO

00:38:44.622 --> 00:38:45.990
UNDERSTAND.

00:38:46.057 --> 00:38:47.491
HOW THE DELTA WORKS HOW THE

00:38:47.558 --> 00:38:48.859
SYSTEM WORKS TO BETTER --

00:38:48.926 --> 00:38:50.628
IMPLEMENT OPERATIONS AND

00:38:50.695 --> 00:38:51.762
EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING IS MEANT

00:38:51.829 --> 00:38:53.464
TO BE SCIENCE BASED DECISION

00:38:53.531 --> 00:38:54.365
MAKING.

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:55.599
THAT'S WHAT WE'VE BEEN PROMOTING

00:38:55.666 --> 00:38:57.068
THAT'S WHY WE ARE COMMITTED TO A

00:38:57.134 --> 00:38:58.703
STANDALONE SEES A PERMIT FOR THE

00:38:58.769 --> 00:39:00.171
STATE WATER PROJECT WHICH IS

00:39:00.237 --> 00:39:01.405
CURRENTLY ONGOING.

00:39:01.472 --> 00:39:03.040
IT'S WHY THE FEDERAL BIOLOGICAL

00:39:03.107 --> 00:39:05.209
OPINIONS ARE CURRENTLY BEING RE

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:06.977
DONE TO INCORPORATE INFORMATION

00:39:07.044 --> 00:39:08.245
THAT'S BEEN DEVELOPED OVER THE

00:39:08.312 --> 00:39:09.213
LAST TEN YEARS.

00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:10.748
WE'RE ALSO APPLYING THE SAME

00:39:10.815 --> 00:39:12.349
SORT OF APPROACH TO THE

00:39:12.416 --> 00:39:13.651
VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS.

00:39:13.718 --> 00:39:16.087
UNFORTUNATELY IF SB ONE WERE TO

00:39:16.153 --> 00:39:17.755
PASS IN ITS CURRENT FORM THE

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.256
STATE WATER PROJECT WOULD HAVE

00:39:19.323 --> 00:39:20.591
ZERO FLEXIBILITY TO ACTUALLY

00:39:20.658 --> 00:39:21.892
PARTICIPATE IN THE VOLUNTARY

00:39:21.959 --> 00:39:23.994
AGREEMENT AND WITHOUT THE STATE

00:39:24.061 --> 00:39:25.262
WATER PROJECTS PARTICIPATION.

00:39:25.329 --> 00:39:26.464
IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING IF

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:27.998
NOT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE VOLUNTARY

00:39:28.065 --> 00:39:32.970
AGREEMENT IN ITS CURRENT FORM TO

00:39:33.037 --> 00:39:34.772
ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED -- SO

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:35.773
THESE ARE THE SPECIFIC REASONS

00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:36.440
WHY WE REMAIN OPPOSED ALL TO THE

00:39:36.507 --> 00:39:37.308
STATE WATER PROJECT BUT AGAIN I

00:39:37.374 --> 00:39:38.442
THINK THERE'S A BROADER

00:39:38.509 --> 00:39:39.910
IMPLICATIONS AROUND HOUSE HE

00:39:39.977 --> 00:39:41.479

FEDERAL ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT.

00:39:47.184 --> 00:39:49.854
OF INFORMATION APPLICATION AND

00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:51.388
HOW IT REGULATES ON THE FEDERAL

00:39:51.455 --> 00:39:54.125
SIDE -- WE WOULD BE WILLING TO

00:39:54.191 --> 00:39:55.426
REMOVE OUR OPPOSITION IF THAT

00:39:55.493 --> 00:39:57.261
PARALLEL TYPE AMENDMENTS WERE

00:39:57.328 --> 00:39:57.995

00:47:42.492 --> 00:47:44.094
FRANKLY THE SPECIES ARE WORSE

00:47:44.161 --> 00:47:44.661
OFF.

00:47:44.728 --> 00:47:46.129
THAN THEY WERE WHEN THOSE

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:48.098
PREVIOUS BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS

00:47:48.165 --> 00:47:49.566
WERE ISSUED SO IT SHOULD BE AT

00:47:49.633 --> 00:47:50.901
LEAST AS PROTECTIVE IF NOT MORE

00:47:50.968 --> 00:47:53.203
SO THAN THEY HAVE THE ABILITY

00:47:53.270 --> 00:47:57.241
UNDER THE UNDER THE BILL. TO

00:47:57.307 --> 00:47:59.343
WRITE A CEASE A PERMANENT.

00:47:59.409 --> 00:48:00.210
WHICH HAS MISSED PIERRE

00:48:00.277 --> 00:48:01.645
MENTIONED THEY'RE ALREADY DOING --

00:48:01.712 --> 00:48:05.415
THAT WOULD MAINTAIN THOSE

00:48:05.482 --> 00:48:05.949
STANDARDS AND IMPROVE THE

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:08.418
MORNING.

00:48:08.485 --> 00:48:10.821
HEY AT THE ONE ELSE.

00:48:10.887 --> 00:48:12.456
ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM.

00:48:12.522 --> 00:48:13.390
SOME MEMBER STONE.

00:48:13.457 --> 00:48:13.991
THANK YOU AND I KNOW THIS IS

00:48:14.057 --> 00:48:14.958
MOVING A LITTLE BIT AND WE'LL

00:48:15.025 --> 00:48:16.360
SEE THIS TOMORROW IN JUDICIARY

00:48:16.426 --> 00:48:17.060
BUT I HAVE BEEN.

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.929
RAISED SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW

00:48:18.996 --> 00:48:20.564
THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURE ACT.

00:48:20.631 --> 00:48:22.733
IS BEING CONSIDERED HERE AS WE

00:48:22.799 --> 00:48:24.768
KNOW.

00:48:24.835 --> 00:48:26.803
IT'S THE LEGISLATURE THE PASSES

00:48:26.870 --> 00:48:29.673
LAWS AND FOR US TO DELEGATE TO

00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:31.408
AN AGENCY THE ABILITY TO DO ITS

00:48:31.475 --> 00:48:33.310
RULE MAKING AND THOSE RULES

00:48:33.377 --> 00:48:35.445
PROPERLY PROMULGATED HAVE THE

00:48:35.512 --> 00:48:36.847
FULL FORCE AND EFFECT OF LAW.

00:48:36.913 --> 00:48:38.882
AND PROPERLY PROMULGATED IS THE

00:48:38.949 --> 00:48:40.484
ISSUE I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE.

00:48:40.550 --> 00:48:41.885
THAT.

00:48:41.952 --> 00:48:43.820
WE ARE ENGAGED IN ANY

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:46.223
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE WE

00:48:46.290 --> 00:48:47.824
HAVE THE BEST POSSIBILITY THAT

00:48:47.891 --> 00:48:49.126
ANY ROOM IN IT IS BEING DONE

00:48:49.192 --> 00:48:50.460
UNDER THIS.

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:53.230
WILL SURVIVE ANY TEST IN THE

00:48:53.297 --> 00:48:54.364
FUTURE BECAUSE I THINK IT WOULD

00:48:54.431 --> 00:48:56.366
UNDERMINE ALL OF THE GOOD WORK

00:48:56.433 --> 00:48:58.902
HERE IF A RULE GETS PROMULGATED.

00:48:58.969 --> 00:48:59.903
TOO QUICKLY.

00:48:59.970 --> 00:49:01.905
OR WITHOUT APPROPRIATE PUBLIC

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:03.807
INPUT AND PUBLIC REVIEW AND THEN

00:49:03.874 --> 00:49:05.876
THAT WHOLE SYSTEM GETS CALLED

00:49:05.942 --> 00:49:07.344
INTO QUESTION BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

00:49:07.411 --> 00:49:08.945
DONE THOUGH THE WORK THAT WE

00:49:09.012 --> 00:49:10.080
NEED TO DO.

00:49:10.147 --> 00:49:11.815
ADMINISTRATIVE LAYERS OR

00:49:11.882 --> 00:49:13.617
PROCEDURALLY SO THAT'S THAT IS A

00:49:13.684 --> 00:49:16.186
QUESTION THAT THAT IS RAISED I

00:49:16.253 --> 00:49:18.622
THINK WE'RE PROBABLY ON THE SAME

00:49:18.689 --> 00:49:20.223
PAGE WITH RESPECT I THINK WITH

00:49:20.290 --> 00:49:21.458
THAT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS ARE.

00:49:21.525 --> 00:49:22.926
BUT I WANT TO JUST WANT TO MAKE

00:49:22.993 --> 00:49:25.095
SURE THAT THIS IS MAYBE MORE MY

00:49:25.162 --> 00:49:27.264
HALF TOMORROW THAN TODAY THAT WE

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.532
REMAINING GAUGED.

00:49:28.598 --> 00:49:30.867
SO THAT WE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

00:49:30.934 --> 00:49:32.069
THE PROCESS BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA

00:49:32.135 --> 00:49:34.071
BE LIVING OR DYING -- ON THE

00:49:34.137 --> 00:49:34.838
PROCESS AND I COMPLETELY

00:49:34.905 --> 00:49:36.239
UNDERSTAND THAT WE'RE VERY

00:49:36.306 --> 00:49:38.141
CONCERNED ABOUT THE FED'S

00:49:38.208 --> 00:49:39.743
ROLLING BACK THEIR RULES.

00:49:39.810 --> 00:49:40.577
CALIFORNIA'S RELIED ON THOSE

00:49:40.644 --> 00:49:42.813
RULES AND AND HAS ONLY FILLED IN

00:49:42.879 --> 00:49:44.514
WHERE NECESSARY WHERE THERE HAVE

00:49:44.581 --> 00:49:45.549
WHAT WE FEEL THEY'VE BEEN GAPS

00:49:45.615 --> 00:49:47.184
IN IN THE FEDERAL.

00:49:47.250 --> 00:49:48.485
THAT'S BEEN REALLY SHIP THAT'S

00:49:48.552 --> 00:49:49.886
WORK NOW IT'S NOT WORKING

00:49:49.953 --> 00:49:50.987
BECAUSE OF A LOT OF THE ROLL

00:49:51.054 --> 00:49:51.922
BACKS I THINK WE NEED TO BE

00:49:51.988 --> 00:49:54.358
CAREFUL IN HOW QUICKLY WE ACT.

00:49:54.424 --> 00:49:57.761
AND THE AREAS THAT WE JUMP INTO.

00:49:57.828 --> 00:49:58.495
WELL MAKE SURE THAT AND MAKE

00:49:58.562 --> 00:49:59.730
SURE THAT WE ARE THOUGHTFUL

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:01.965
ABOUT THAT IN FILLING THE GAPS

00:50:02.032 --> 00:50:03.300
AS NECESSARY NOT JUST.

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:04.401
REACTING FOR THE SAKE OF

00:50:04.468 --> 00:50:06.136
REACTING BUT THOUGHTFULLY

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.637
PUTTING IN PLACE THE RULES THAT

00:50:07.704 --> 00:50:09.873
WE NEED TO PUT IN PLACE AND

00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:10.640
THESE ARE RULES THAT ARE GOING

00:50:10.707 --> 00:50:11.942
TO LAST FOR A LONG TIME.

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:12.843
I MEAN I KNOW THIS SORT OF

00:50:12.909 --> 00:50:14.611
SUNSETS AND THERE'S THOUGHT

00:50:14.678 --> 00:50:15.512
ABOUT THAT THERE'S COULD WORRY

00:50:15.579 --> 00:50:16.913
ABOUT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION.

00:50:16.980 --> 00:50:18.548
BUT IN MY VIEW IF WE ARE GOING

00:50:18.615 --> 00:50:19.716
TO CHANGE THE ENDANGERED SPECIES

00:50:19.783 --> 00:50:21.184
ACT FOR THE BETTER AND WE ARE

00:50:21.251 --> 00:50:23.620
GOING TO BE LISTING SPECIES I

00:50:23.687 --> 00:50:25.155
DON'T SEE THAT WORK ALSO GET.

00:50:25.222 --> 00:50:26.890
ROLLED BACK BECAUSE WE WILL BE

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.358
DOING THIS WORK UNDER A SET OF

00:50:28.425 --> 00:50:30.293
CALIFORNIA VALUES AND THE WAY

00:50:30.360 --> 00:50:32.295
THAT WE EXPECT TO BE MANAGING

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:33.964
OUR OUR ENVIRONMENT SO I WAS THE

00:50:34.030 --> 00:50:35.866
LOOK AT THIS AS CALIFORNIA

00:50:35.932 --> 00:50:37.701
TAKING MORE CONTROL IN A

00:50:37.768 --> 00:50:39.936
PRODUCTIVE AN APPROPRIATE WAY.

00:50:40.003 --> 00:50:41.138
LONG TERM.

00:50:41.204 --> 00:50:41.972
AND SO I WORRY ABOUT THIS

00:50:42.038 --> 00:50:44.074
FEELING OF NEEDING TO REACT FOR

00:50:44.141 --> 00:50:45.675
THE SAKE OF REACTING AND WE ARE

00:50:45.742 --> 00:50:47.144
BETTER OFF SERVE BY REALLY

00:50:47.210 --> 00:50:48.812
LOOKING AT WHAT WE HAVE IN PLACE.

00:50:48.879 --> 00:50:50.814
MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE.

00:50:50.881 --> 00:50:52.249
MEETING OUR STANDARDS WHETHER

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:54.117
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MEETS THE

00:50:54.184 --> 00:50:55.419
STANDARDS OR NOT.

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:56.686
AND THAT'S KIND OF HOW I LOOK AT

00:50:56.753 --> 00:50:58.088
THIS BILL AND AND I HOPE THAT

00:50:58.155 --> 00:51:00.457
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WILL

00:51:00.524 --> 00:51:02.192
IS A CONCEPT THAT WE WILL KEEP

00:51:02.259 --> 00:51:03.493
GOING REGARDLESS OF DESTRUCTION

00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:05.162
SAYING THERE'S VALUE IN THAT.

00:51:05.228 --> 00:51:07.497
SO CENTER YOU'VE YOU'VE TAKEN ON

00:51:07.564 --> 00:51:09.166
SOMETHING I NOT SURE IT'S A

00:51:09.232 --> 00:51:11.001
SIMPLE BILL MAYBE IF YOU READ IT

00:51:11.067 --> 00:51:11.701
LOOKS SIMPLE BUT THE

00:51:11.768 --> 00:51:12.202
IMPLICATIONS ARE PRETTY

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:13.203
SIGNIFICANT.

00:51:13.270 --> 00:51:14.304
BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE ARE

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.907
STEPPING IN. TO A TERRITORY THAT

00:51:16.973 --> 00:51:19.242
HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY MANAGED IN A

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:20.944
WAY WE FELT COMFORTABLE WITH AT

00:51:21.011 --> 00:51:23.480
THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND NOW.

00:51:23.547 --> 00:51:24.414
LESS SO SHALL I SAY SO I

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:26.149

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:52.976
OVER THE LAST FIVE COMMITTEE

00:51:53.043 --> 00:51:54.377
HEARINGS. TO ACTUALLY MAKE A LOT

00:51:54.444 --> 00:51:55.312

UPON A LOT AND WE'VE COME TO

00:52:02.385 --> 00:52:03.487
AGREEMENT ON A NUMBER OF THINGS

00:52:03.553 --> 00:52:05.322
WE STILL HAVE SOME THINGS WE

00:52:05.388 --> 00:52:06.790

PROPER REVIEW.

00:52:21.104 --> 00:52:23.139
TRANSPARENCY THAT'S WHY WE PUT

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:24.307
INTO THE BILL TO ADOPT THE

00:52:24.374 --> 00:52:25.375
BASELINE FEDERAL STANDARD

FOR HOW WE CAN MAKE THIS MORE

00:52:35.852 --> 00:52:37.587
CLEAR -- SO THAT IT MEETS THE

00:52:37.654 --> 00:52:38.688
INTENT OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:52:38.755 --> 00:52:40.590

HAPPY TO ENTERTAIN YOUR

00:52:44.861 --> 00:52:47.197

00:52:47.264 --> 00:52:50.333
VERY CLEAR AND WE'VE TRIED TO

00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:50.567
PUT IT.

SAID THIS IS CIVIL BELL I

00:52:56.273 --> 00:52:57.073
THOUGHT TRYING TO OVER SIMPLIFY

00:52:57.140 --> 00:52:58.808
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE FOR

00:52:58.875 --> 00:52:59.376
THIS AREA IS ACTUALLY VERY

00:52:59.442 --> 00:53:00.210
COMPLEX.

00:53:00.277 --> 00:53:01.978
AND IF WE GET IT WRONG THERE'S A

00:53:02.045 --> 00:53:03.914
LOT AT STAKE SO I WOULD NEVER

00:53:03.980 --> 00:53:05.282

NOT MENTION ANY LEGISLATORS NAME

00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:21.298
WHEN I SAID THAT. FOR THE RECORD.

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.766
YEAH NO CHAIR WILL WE GET A

00:53:22.832 --> 00:53:25.201
CHANCE TO RESPOND I KNOW OKAY.

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:26.703
UNLESS YOU ASK THE QUESTION BUT

00:53:26.770 --> 00:53:29.639
THANK YOU -- ANY OTHER FOR MARKS

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:30.340
MANY ONE UP HERE.

00:53:30.407 --> 00:53:31.608
I'LL JUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN

00:53:31.675 --> 00:53:32.943
YOU TAKE ON A BIG ISUE IT'S

00:53:33.009 --> 00:53:34.010

00:53:34.077 --> 00:53:35.579
SUPPORT IN A LOT OF OPPOSITION

00:53:35.645 --> 00:53:36.046
AND IT TAKES A LOT OF

00:53:36.112 --> 00:53:37.247
CONVERSATIONS.

00:53:37.314 --> 00:53:39.482
AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT

00:53:39.549 --> 00:53:41.952
CERTAINLY REARED ITS UGLY HEAD

00:53:42.018 --> 00:53:42.786
BECAUSE OF THE FEDERAL

00:53:42.852 --> 00:53:43.787
ADMINISTRATION BUT I THINK IT'S

00:53:43.853 --> 00:53:45.188
TIME THAT CALIFORNIA TOOK A LOOK

01:19:09.411 --> 01:19:10.378
WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING

01:19:10.445 --> 01:19:12.681
IN GARAGES THAT HAVE KIDS THAT

01:19:12.747 --> 01:19:14.082
ARE SLEEPING IN ADDICTS WHICH IS.

01:19:14.149 --> 01:19:15.984
TREMENDOUSLY AND SAFE -- WE HAVE

01:19:16.051 --> 01:19:18.353
PEOPLE THAT ARE LIVING IN SHEDS

01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:19.721
THEY'RE LIVING IN THE CARS AND

01:19:19.788 --> 01:19:22.124
SO THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE THAT

01:19:22.190 --> 01:19:23.725
I'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN

01:19:23.792 --> 01:19:26.661
IS THERE A NEED -- FOR FOR

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:29.464
HOUSING FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND

01:19:29.531 --> 01:19:30.899
THEY NEED TO BE AFFORDABLE AND

01:19:30.966 --> 01:19:32.267
IN THE MEANTIME WE'RE SPENDING

01:19:32.334 --> 01:19:34.436
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY COUNTY

01:19:34.503 --> 01:19:37.139
AND CITY TO CLEAN UP TRASH AND

01:19:37.205 --> 01:19:37.472
TO SANITIZE.

01:19:37.539 --> 01:19:40.509
AREA WERE AREAS WHERE PEOPLE --

01:19:40.575 --> 01:19:41.676
THEIR NEEDS ARE NOT BEING MET

01:19:41.743 --> 01:19:43.211
AND WHERE THEY'RE LIVING OUTSIDE

01:19:43.278 --> 01:19:44.880
AND PEOPLE'S LIVES ARE BEING

01:19:44.946 --> 01:19:46.948
DESTROYED BY IN THE PROCESS SO

01:19:47.015 --> 01:19:50.318
TWO YEARS AGO I I RAN A BILL --

01:19:50.385 --> 01:19:51.153
THAT.

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.687
BUT THAT WAS SEEKING TO TO SOLVE

01:19:52.754 --> 01:19:53.822
THIS ISSUE ONE OF THE GOOD

01:19:53.889 --> 01:19:54.623
THINGS THAT THE FEDERAL

01:19:54.689 --> 01:19:56.057
GOVERNMENT DID TWO YEARS AGO I

01:19:56.124 --> 01:19:56.858
SAY.

01:19:56.925 --> 01:19:59.961
WHEN THEY PASSED THEIR -- THEIR

01:20:00.028 --> 01:20:02.097
THEIR BUDGET BILL THEY CREATED

01:20:02.164 --> 01:20:03.565
WHAT ARE CALLED OPPORTUNITIES ON

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:06.635
TWITTER OPPORTUNITIES FOR STATES

01:20:06.701 --> 01:20:08.036
TO BE ABLE TO TAKE.

01:20:08.103 --> 01:20:10.739
UP PUBLIC DOLLARS AND HELP

01:20:10.805 --> 01:20:12.073
IMPROVE THEIR POOREST

01:20:12.140 --> 01:20:13.375
COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE

01:20:13.441 --> 01:20:15.010
HAVE EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:20:15.076 --> 01:20:15.977
NINE OPPORTUNITY ZONES THAT HAVE

01:20:16.044 --> 01:20:17.245
BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THEY

01:20:17.312 --> 01:20:18.880
DESPERATELY NEED REVITALIZATION

01:20:18.947 --> 01:20:20.916
WHICH MEANS THEY NEED HOUSING

01:20:20.982 --> 01:20:21.983
AND THEY NEED JOBS.

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:26.421
AND WHEN I DID MY ASSEMBLY BILL --

01:20:26.488 --> 01:20:27.255
THIRTY THIRTY IT LOOKED AT THE

01:20:27.322 --> 01:20:32.060
OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE SIX TRILLION

01:20:32.127 --> 01:20:33.628
DOLLARS IN PUBLIC IN A PRIVATE

01:20:33.695 --> 01:20:34.663
FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO INVEST IN

01:20:34.729 --> 01:20:36.665
THESE COMMUNITIES AND AND THOSE

01:20:36.731 --> 01:20:39.000
ARE CAPITAL GAINS -- FUNDS TO BE

01:20:39.067 --> 01:20:40.669
ABLE TO BUILD WORKFORCE HOUSING

01:20:40.735 --> 01:20:43.038
CREATE GOOD JOBS AND THAT BILL

01:20:43.104 --> 01:20:45.040
CREATED A SEQUEL EXEMPTION AND

01:20:45.106 --> 01:20:46.174
WE MAKE WE GOT IT THROUGH THE

01:20:46.241 --> 01:20:48.743
LEGISLATURE I PASSED -- I PASSED

01:20:48.810 --> 01:20:50.745
IT THROUGH THE ASSEMBLY WITH

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.314
FIFTY SIX VOTE AND IT ENDED UP

01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:54.549
BEING HELD UP IN THE SENATE IN

01:20:54.616 --> 01:20:57.586
APPROPRIATIONS -- AND AND AND

01:20:57.652 --> 01:20:58.687
PART OF THE CHALLENGE WHEN I

01:20:58.753 --> 01:21:00.222
CAME BACK IN THE SENATE THIS

01:21:00.288 --> 01:21:01.656
YEAR'S I TOOK A LOOK AT THAT AND

01:21:01.723 --> 01:21:03.491
I SAID YOU KNOW -- IT MADE

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:05.160
PEOPLE UNCOMFORTABLE AND IT WAS

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:06.828
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT IT WAS A

01:21:06.895 --> 01:21:08.830
HEAVY LIFT BECAUSE PEOPLE WERE

01:21:08.897 --> 01:21:11.733
WERE ASKED -- TO AGREED THAT WE

01:21:11.800 --> 01:21:13.668
WOULD WAIVE SEEK WELL IN ORDER

01:21:13.735 --> 01:21:15.170
TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE AND SO

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:16.538
THIS YEAR WHAT I DID IS I TOOK A

01:21:16.605 --> 01:21:18.273
MUCH SOFTER APPROACH AND I SAID

01:21:18.340 --> 01:21:21.142
YOU KNOW -- THAT THAT THE CRISIS

01:21:21.209 --> 01:21:23.178
HASN'T GOTTEN ANY BETTER WE'RE

01:21:23.245 --> 01:21:24.646
IN MUCH MORE DESPERATE.

01:21:24.713 --> 01:21:27.148
NEED OF HOUSING THAN WE WERE TWO

01:21:27.215 --> 01:21:29.818
YEARS AGO AND SO THE APPROACH.

01:21:29.884 --> 01:21:32.487
THAT I TOOK WAS TO WORK VERY

01:21:32.554 --> 01:21:34.656
DILIGENTLY WITH THE SENATE

01:21:34.723 --> 01:21:36.191
COMMITTEES THAT WE WENT THROUGH

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:39.194
AND WE WE SB TWENTY FIVE

01:21:39.261 --> 01:21:40.962
REQUIRES THE HIGHEST IN IN

01:21:41.029 --> 01:21:42.664
ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS PROJECTS

01:21:42.731 --> 01:21:44.366
MUST BE CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.967
PLANS AND ZONING CODES.

01:21:46.034 --> 01:21:47.736
IT REQUIRES LEAD GOLD

01:21:47.802 --> 01:21:49.404
CERTIFICATION WAS ZERO NET

01:21:49.471 --> 01:21:51.940
EMISSIONS ZERO NET GHG.

01:21:52.007 --> 01:21:53.275
IT PROTECTS AGAINST

01:21:53.341 --> 01:21:55.810
GENTRIFICATION AND DISPLACEMENT

01:21:55.877 --> 01:21:57.245
75% OF THE TOTAL SQUARE FOOTAGE

01:21:57.312 --> 01:21:58.680
HAS TO BE DEDICATED TOWARDS

01:21:58.747 --> 01:22:01.316
HOUSING AND A MINIMUM OF 40% OF

01:22:01.383 --> 01:22:02.050
THOSE UNITS HAVE TO BE

01:22:02.117 --> 01:22:02.784
AFFORDABLE.

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:04.586
AND IT REQUIRES A SKILLED AND

01:22:04.653 --> 01:22:05.954
TRAIN WORK WORK FORCE AND

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:07.455
PREVAILING WAGE AND THERE'S NO

01:22:07.522 --> 01:22:08.923
SECRET EXEMPTION.

01:22:08.990 --> 01:22:11.960
PERIOD YOU HAVE TO BUILD AND AND

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:14.029
GO THROUGH THE WHOLE PROCESS TO

01:22:14.095 --> 01:22:16.631
DETERMINE -- WHETHER YOU HAVE TO

01:22:16.698 --> 01:22:18.533
DO A SECRET DOCUMENT OR NOT

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:20.702
DEPENDING ON ON YOUR GENERAL

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:22.404
PLANTS IN YOUR ZONING CODES.

01:22:22.470 --> 01:22:24.439
IT JUST DOES ONE THING AND THAT

01:22:24.506 --> 01:22:27.609
ONE THING IS CREATE -- A

01:22:27.676 --> 01:22:31.146
EXPEDITED JUDICIAL REVIEW

01:22:31.212 --> 01:22:32.514
PROCESS THAT HAS TO BE DONE

01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.581
WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:34.983
DAYS IF IT'S ECONOMICALLY FOR IS

01:22:35.050 --> 01:22:39.321
IT IF IT'S FEASIBLE TO DO THAT.

01:22:39.387 --> 01:22:41.222
DISTRESSED AS I SIT HERE TODAY

01:22:41.289 --> 01:22:44.225
IS THAT -- WE WORKED REALLY HARD

01:22:44.292 --> 01:22:46.261
AT TRYING TO CRAFT A SOLUTION

01:22:46.328 --> 01:22:48.763
THAT WAS GOING TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:48.830 --> 01:22:49.998
GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:51.533
ABLE TO GO OUT TO THOSE

01:22:51.599 --> 01:22:52.967
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE THAT ARE

01:22:53.034 --> 01:22:54.536
SAYING CAM CALIFORNIA ISN'T

01:22:54.602 --> 01:22:56.438
DOING ANYTHING. TO BUILD A

01:22:56.504 --> 01:22:57.939
HOUSING THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED

01:22:58.006 --> 01:22:59.841
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO BE ABLE TO

01:22:59.908 --> 01:23:02.777
STEP UP AND TO TELL -- IT PEOPLE

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:04.446
IN OUR COMMUNITIES WE HEAR YOU

01:23:04.512 --> 01:23:06.181
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEED IS

01:23:06.247 --> 01:23:06.681
AND WE'RE WILLING TO DO

01:23:06.748 --> 01:23:08.683
SOMETHING ABOUT IT.

01:23:08.750 --> 01:23:09.617
AND IF WE CAN GIVE.

01:23:09.684 --> 01:23:12.087
STADIUMS AND ARENAS.

01:23:12.153 --> 01:23:14.789
A AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THEIR

01:23:14.856 --> 01:23:16.925
COMPLICATED PROJECTS REVIEWED

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:18.593
WITHIN TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY

01:23:18.660 --> 01:23:20.362
DAYS AND CERTAINLY WE CAN TAKE --

01:23:20.428 --> 01:23:21.930
A THESE MIXED USE AND HOUSING

01:23:21.996 --> 01:23:23.732
PROJECTS AND AND GIVE THEM THE

01:23:23.798 --> 01:23:25.934
SAME KIND OF KIND OF RELIEF.

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.436
IT IN IN TERMS OF A JUDICIAL

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:30.071
JUDICIAL REVIEW AND ON THE ONE

01:23:30.138 --> 01:23:31.573
THAT HAND EYE HERE -- SEEK WAYS

01:23:31.639 --> 01:23:33.575
IN A PROBLEM IN IN THAT'S REALLY

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:35.076
NOT IT IS THE SEQUEL EDUCATION

01:23:35.143 --> 01:23:36.311
ISN'T WHAT'S CAUSING THE PROBLEM

01:23:36.378 --> 01:23:37.379
WELL IF IT'S NOT CAUSING THE

01:23:37.445 --> 01:23:38.279
PROBLEM.

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.615
THEN WE CERTAINLY WON'T SEE -- A

01:23:40.682 --> 01:23:44.319
LOT OF SECRET CASES FILED -- IT

01:23:44.386 --> 01:23:45.520
IN ITS THE CERTAINTY OF

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:47.055
CONSTRUCTION IT'S PROVIDING AN

01:23:47.122 --> 01:23:48.556
OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW THAT WE'RE

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:49.624
GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET A

01:23:49.691 --> 01:23:50.525
PROJECT STARTED.

01:23:50.592 --> 01:23:52.160
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE

01:23:52.227 --> 01:23:53.294
PROJECT TO THE END WITHIN A

01:23:53.361 --> 01:23:55.730
CERTAIN PERIOD OF TIME SO WHY IS

01:23:55.797 --> 01:23:58.266
THIS ALL IMPORTANT -- I CRAFTED

01:23:58.333 --> 01:23:59.901
SB TWENTY FIVE SO THAT THE

01:23:59.968 --> 01:24:01.136
CITIES IN THE COUNTY THAT NEED

01:24:01.202 --> 01:24:03.471
BILL HOUSING -- BITS AFFORDABLE

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:04.806
TO THE WORKING FAMILIES CAN GET

01:24:04.873 --> 01:24:06.107
THEIR HANDS ON THE SIX TRILLION

01:24:06.174 --> 01:24:08.309
DOLLARS OF CAPITAL GAINS TAX

01:24:08.376 --> 01:24:09.677
IT'S AVAILABLE FOR PRIVATE

01:24:09.744 --> 01:24:10.645
INVESTMENT.

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:11.546
SO THAT WE CAN IMPROVE THE

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.615
STREETS AND THE SEWERS AND THE

01:24:13.681 --> 01:24:16.251
ELECTRICAL IN SOME OF OUR MOST

01:24:16.317 --> 01:24:17.419
CHALLENGING NEIGHBORHOODS SO

01:24:17.485 --> 01:24:19.087
THAT WE CAN BUILD HOUSING PARKS

01:24:19.154 --> 01:24:20.588
AND RECREATION CENTERS.

01:24:20.655 --> 01:24:22.190
IMPROVE LIVING CONDITION IN OUR

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:23.625
POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS AND MORE

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.460
IMPORTANTLY SO WE COULD START

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.095
CHAU STRUGGLING CALIFORNIANS.

01:24:27.162 --> 01:24:29.497
THAT ARE FACING RISING RENTS AND

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.533
THAT OVERCROWDING IN APARTMENTS

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.001
IN GARAGES IN ATTICS.

01:24:33.067 --> 01:24:34.702
CHILDREN AND SENIORS WHO ARE

01:24:34.769 --> 01:24:36.771
HOMELESS THAT THEIR NUMBER ONE

01:24:36.838 --> 01:24:39.107
CONCERN THAT HAS BEEN RAISED IT

01:24:39.174 --> 01:24:41.543
IS SOMETHING THAT WERE -- TAKING

01:24:41.609 --> 01:24:43.745
SERIOUSLY AND THAT WE UNDERSTAND

01:24:43.812 --> 01:24:45.713
THE NEED TO BUILD AS QUICKLY AS

01:24:45.780 --> 01:24:47.382
POSSIBLE AND TO DO IT IN A WAY

01:24:47.449 --> 01:24:49.284
THAT PROTECTS OUR NEIGHBORHOOD

01:24:49.350 --> 01:24:54.289
AND THAT -- THAT THAT REALLY

01:24:54.355 --> 01:24:55.824
DOESN'T -- DOESN'T TRAMPLE ON ON

01:24:55.890 --> 01:24:58.026
ANYONE'S RIGHTS OR ON ON THE

01:24:58.092 --> 01:24:59.627
SEEK SEEK WELL BECAUSE YOU HAVE

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.129
TO GO THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS

01:25:01.196 --> 01:25:04.499
IN THE FIRST PLACE SO -- WHAT

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:07.135
WHAT SB TWENTY FIVE IS?

01:25:07.202 --> 01:25:09.037
IS FOCUSED ON IS CREATING

01:25:09.103 --> 01:25:10.939
SOLUTIONS BY USING THE SAME

01:25:11.005 --> 01:25:12.574
TOOLS THAT WE'VE USED IN THE

01:25:12.640 --> 01:25:15.009
PAST AND SO NOT EVERYTHING CAN

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:15.944
WAIT TILL TOMORROW.

01:25:16.010 --> 01:25:17.245
DID I MENTION THAT THERE SIX

01:25:17.312 --> 01:25:18.546
TRILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL

01:25:18.613 --> 01:25:20.682
GAINS TAX -- PRIVATE INVESTMENT

01:25:20.748 --> 01:25:21.883
THAT WOULD HELP US TO HOUSE ARE

01:25:21.950 --> 01:25:23.751
WORKING FAMILIES WE OWE IT TO

01:25:23.818 --> 01:25:25.520
THEM AND THE TAX CREDIT ENDS IN

01:25:25.587 --> 01:25:27.088
SIX YEARS AND AS YOU NOW IF YOU

01:25:27.155 --> 01:25:28.623
START TO DEVELOP A PROJECT RIGHT

01:25:28.690 --> 01:25:29.290
NOW.

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:31.192
AND BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN START

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:32.894
CONSTRUCTION WITHIN SIX YEARS --

01:25:32.961 --> 01:25:34.496
I'VE GOT A BROKE AT BRIDGE IN

01:25:34.562 --> 01:25:36.097
BROOKLYN THAT I CAN SELL YOU --

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:37.499
THE REASON THIS IS SO

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:38.733
TREMENDOUSLY IMPORTANT IS WE'RE

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.168
ASKING PEOPLE TO INVEST MONEY IN

01:25:40.235 --> 01:25:41.603
CALIFORNIA AND WE NEED TO BE

01:25:41.669 --> 01:25:43.137
COMPETITIVE WITH OTHER STATES SO

01:25:43.204 --> 01:25:44.672
I UNDERSTAND WE'RE GOING TO COME

01:25:44.739 --> 01:25:46.207
BACK NEXT YEAR AND HAVE THE SAME

THIS BILL WOULD HAVE MAY HAD A

01:28:03.711 --> 01:28:04.912

01:28:12.153 --> 01:28:13.855
BEEN SUBJECTED TO LITIGATION BUT

01:28:13.921 --> 01:28:15.823
WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL THAT HAVE

01:28:15.890 --> 01:28:17.125
BEEN DETERRED FROM MOVING

01:28:17.191 --> 01:28:18.259
FORWARD WITH THE PROJECT BECAUSE

01:28:18.326 --> 01:28:19.494
OF THE POTENTIAL.

01:28:19.560 --> 01:28:21.396
LITIGATION THAT COULD COME AT IT

01:28:21.462 --> 01:28:22.563
AS BECAUSE OF THE LOCATION OF

01:28:22.630 --> 01:28:23.364
BECAUSE OF THE SURROUNDING

01:28:23.431 --> 01:28:24.098
NEIGHBORHOOD.

01:28:24.165 --> 01:28:25.166
AND SO HAVING ONE OF THE

01:28:25.233 --> 01:28:26.467
STREAMLINING WOULD HAVE BEEN

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:28.469
ENOUGH FOR YOU TO GO FORWARD

01:28:28.536 --> 01:28:29.003
EVEN WITH THE THREAT OF

01:28:29.070 --> 01:28:30.805
LITIGATION THIS PROJECT WOULD

01:28:30.872 --> 01:28:31.773
HAVE MOVED FORWARD IF IT IF IT

01:28:31.839 --> 01:28:34.075
IF IT HAD A HAD THE TWO HUNDRED

01:28:34.142 --> 01:28:36.010
SEVENTY DAY -- THE GUARANTEE OF

01:28:36.077 --> 01:28:36.644
BEING HEARD IN THAT AMOUNT OF

01:28:36.711 --> 01:28:37.211
TIME WITH HAT IT MADE THE

01:28:37.278 --> 01:28:38.346
DIFFERENCE I DON'T THINK THERE'S

01:28:38.413 --> 01:28:39.480
ANY WAY TO TELL THE ONE IN

01:28:39.547 --> 01:28:41.482
REDWOOD CITY SPECIFICALLY WAS IT

01:28:41.549 --> 01:28:44.018
SETTLED IN SIXTEEN MONTHS -- IN

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:44.819
A LOT OF THAT WAS IT THE

01:28:44.886 --> 01:28:47.321
PRESSURE -- ON TO THE LEAD AGAIN

01:28:47.388 --> 01:28:53.428
AND THAT BUT THAT SAME POTENTIAL

01:28:53.494 --> 01:28:54.862
LITIGATION ACROSS THE STREET

01:28:54.929 --> 01:28:55.563
FROM ANOTHER NON HABITAT

01:28:55.630 --> 01:28:56.097
DEVELOPMENT THE TURF THAT

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:56.731
PROJECT FOR MOVING FORWARD TO

01:28:56.798 --> 01:28:57.398
THE I THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO

01:28:57.465 --> 01:28:58.032
TELL BECAUSE EVERY CIRCUMSTANCES

01:28:58.099 --> 01:28:58.633
YOU KNOW WAS VERY DIFFERENT.

01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.233
DEPENDING ON THE NEIGHBORHOOD

01:28:59.300 --> 01:28:59.834
AND BECAME A DEPENDING ON THE

01:28:59.901 --> 01:29:01.335
PROJECT AND HABITAT IS A BRAND

01:29:01.402 --> 01:29:02.937
THAT NOT EVERYONE LIKES TO CO.

01:29:03.004 --> 01:29:05.039
SO HABITAT THOUGH THEY FOR THE

01:29:05.106 --> 01:29:06.474
YOU KNOW HAVE RECENTLY BEEN SUED.

01:29:06.541 --> 01:29:08.042
A LOT OF OUR PROJECTS HAVE NOT

01:29:08.109 --> 01:29:09.277
BEEN SUBJECT TO THE LITIGATION

01:29:09.343 --> 01:29:10.611
THE PAST AND A LOT OF THEM HAVE

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:12.013
BEEN SMALLER BUT NOW.

01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:13.347
BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND FOR

01:29:13.414 --> 01:29:14.982
HOUSING A LOT OF OUR PROJECTS

01:29:15.049 --> 01:29:16.818
ARE NOW HIGHER DENSITY PROJECTS

01:29:16.884 --> 01:29:18.186
THAN TRADITIONALLY HABITAT I

01:29:18.252 --> 01:29:20.321
THINK IN YOUR DISTRICT HAVE BEEN

A PLUS I'M UNITS TOGETHER SO I

01:29:28.763 --> 01:29:29.764
DON'T THINK THAT NEW MODEL OF

01:29:29.831 --> 01:29:31.132
HABITAT HAS NECESSARILY BEEN

01:29:31.199 --> 01:29:34.535
TESTED BECAUSE IT'S NEW AND IT'S

01:29:34.602 --> 01:29:34.802

01:38:08.215 --> 01:38:09.183
YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I

01:38:09.250 --> 01:38:10.818
UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE BEHIND

01:38:10.884 --> 01:38:13.220
IT AND I THINK THAT EVERYBODY UP

01:38:13.287 --> 01:38:14.288
HERE.

01:38:14.355 --> 01:38:16.056
HAS SYMPATHY WITH TRYING TO

01:38:16.123 --> 01:38:17.324
BUILD AFFORDABLE HOUSING TRYING

01:38:17.391 --> 01:38:18.659
TO ATTRACT JOBS.

01:38:18.726 --> 01:38:20.227
I DON'T THINK THAT IT'S THE CASE

01:38:20.294 --> 01:38:21.595
OF THE LEGISLATURE IS DONE

01:38:21.662 --> 01:38:23.264
NOTHING WHEN IT COMES TO HOUSING

01:38:23.330 --> 01:38:24.732
A WERE ALL ABOUT TO VOTE ON IT

01:38:24.798 --> 01:38:26.166
WE ALL VOTED LAST WEEK ON

01:38:26.233 --> 01:38:27.468
MILLION HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF

01:38:27.534 --> 01:38:28.702
DOLLARS GOING TO AFFORDABLE

01:38:28.769 --> 01:38:29.937
HOUSING ACROSS THE STATE OF

01:38:30.004 --> 01:38:30.938
CALIFORNIA.

01:38:31.005 --> 01:38:32.506
AND WE'VE SEEN A MULTITUDE OF

01:38:32.573 --> 01:38:34.208
HOUSING BILLS I MYSELF HAVE

01:38:34.275 --> 01:38:35.843
SEVERAL HOUSING BILLS.

01:38:35.909 --> 01:38:37.511
WE'VE HAD A OF PROBABLY AS MANY

01:38:37.578 --> 01:38:39.013
HOUSING BILLS IS ALMOST ANY

01:38:39.079 --> 01:38:40.481
OTHER TOPIC I'M IN THIS

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:42.783
LEGISLATURE IN THE LAST FEW

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:45.619
YEARS -- BUT THE REASON THAT I

01:38:45.686 --> 01:38:46.854
ASK FOR THIS BILL TO ME MADE A

01:38:46.920 --> 01:38:47.755
TO YOUR BILLS BECAUSE I THINK

01:38:47.821 --> 01:38:48.255
THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:38:48.322 --> 01:38:49.723
ASSUMPTIONS THAT GO INTO THE

01:38:49.790 --> 01:38:51.392
BILL THAT I'M NOT SURE WE'RE

01:38:51.458 --> 01:38:52.726
READY.

01:38:52.793 --> 01:38:54.628
TO REALLY MAKE SO THOSE SORT OF

01:38:54.695 --> 01:38:56.363
IN TRYING TO INTO LAW ONE IS

01:38:56.430 --> 01:38:58.599
THAT ITS SEQUEL THAT'S BLOCKING

01:38:58.666 --> 01:39:00.000
THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS IN

01:39:00.067 --> 01:39:01.869
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS -- IN OUR

01:39:01.935 --> 01:39:04.171
LOWER INCOME CENSUS TRACKS THAT

01:39:04.238 --> 01:39:06.340
ANYTIME A PROJECTS -- PROPOSE

01:39:06.407 --> 01:39:08.809
WHETHER IT'S A CLEAN JOBS

01:39:08.876 --> 01:39:10.577
PROJECT OR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:39:10.644 --> 01:39:11.312
THAT IT'S IMMEDIATELY THE

01:39:11.378 --> 01:39:13.747
SUBJECT OF A SEQUEL LAWSUIT.

01:39:13.814 --> 01:39:14.682
IS CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT

01:39:14.748 --> 01:39:15.883
I'VE SEEN OR SOMETHING THAT I

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:17.151
THINK THE DATA SHOWS THAT THAT'S

01:39:17.217 --> 01:39:18.686
THE CASE IN THE MAJORITY OF

01:39:18.752 --> 01:39:19.720
PROJECTS.

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:22.222
ALSO A KIND OF DOUBLING DOWN ON

01:39:22.289 --> 01:39:23.557
THE TAX INCENTIVES FOR THE

01:39:23.624 --> 01:39:25.059
OPPORTUNITIES OWNS AND THINKING

01:39:25.125 --> 01:39:26.026
THAT THIS WILL HELP US COMPETE

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:27.561
AGAINST OTHER STATES I'M ALSO

01:39:27.628 --> 01:39:29.063
NOT SURE THAT THAT'S REALLY THE

01:39:29.129 --> 01:39:30.798
CASE GIVEN THAT OTHER STATES.

01:39:30.864 --> 01:39:31.899
HAVE FOR INSTANCE WE KERN FIRE

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:33.200
MENTAL LAWS THEY HAVE CHEAPER

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:34.635
LAND THEY HAVE ALL KINDS OF

01:39:34.702 --> 01:39:36.337
THINGS THAT ARE ALSO WORKING

01:39:36.403 --> 01:39:38.372
AGAINST CALIFORNIA IN SOME CASES

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:38.872
WHEN IT COMES TO THOSE

01:39:38.939 --> 01:39:39.973
INVESTMENTS.

01:39:40.040 --> 01:39:41.842
NOT TO MENTION A CHEAPER COST OF

01:39:41.909 --> 01:39:43.210
LIVING FOR EMPLOYEES OF

01:39:43.277 --> 01:39:44.645
COMPANIES THERE'S A WHOLE SLATE

01:39:44.712 --> 01:39:46.347
OF THINGS THAT FIGURE INTO A

01:39:46.413 --> 01:39:47.815
COMPANIES DECISION OF WHETHER

01:39:47.881 --> 01:39:49.016
GOING TO MOVE TO TEXAS.

01:39:49.083 --> 01:39:51.118
I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA AND UNTIL

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:51.785
WE'VE HEARD DIRECTLY FROM SOME

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.821
OF THOSE BUSINESSES FOR INSTANCE

01:39:53.887 --> 01:39:55.022
AT THAT.

01:39:55.089 --> 01:39:56.190
A TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAY

01:39:56.256 --> 01:39:58.258
SEQUEL -- STREAMLINING IS GOING

01:39:58.325 --> 01:39:59.860
TO REALLY HELP THAT SCALE I

01:39:59.927 --> 01:40:01.161
THINK IT'S HARD TO REALLY MAKE

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:04.164
THAT ARGUMENT THAT IT'S GOING TO

01:40:04.231 --> 01:40:05.432
MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- THE BILL IS

01:40:05.499 --> 01:40:06.200
NOT JUST ABOUT AFFORDABLE

01:40:06.266 --> 01:40:08.769
HOUSING IT'S ALSO ABOUT -- OTHER

01:40:08.836 --> 01:40:11.705
TYPES OF BUSINESSES -- AND YOU

01:40:11.772 --> 01:40:12.806
KNOW FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN FROM

01:40:12.873 --> 01:40:14.808
SEQUEL LAWSUITS YEAH BUT TWO

01:40:14.875 --> 01:40:15.576
HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS YOU KNOW

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:17.044
THAT MAYBE SOMETHING BUT A LOT

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:19.380
OF TIMES EVEN IF YOU HAVE THE

01:40:19.446 --> 01:40:20.013
TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY DAYS AND AS

01:40:20.080 --> 01:40:20.748
SOMEONE MENTION.

01:40:20.814 --> 01:40:22.383
SEQUEL ALREADY HAS PRIORITY IN A

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:23.851
LOT OF JURISDICTIONS IN LOS

01:40:23.917 --> 01:40:25.686
ANGELES THERE ARE SEE FOR JUDGES

01:40:25.753 --> 01:40:26.787
AND THAT'S ALL THE HERE IN THOSE

01:40:26.854 --> 01:40:28.422
CASES DO CAN TEND TO BE HER

01:40:28.489 --> 01:40:29.156
QUICKLY.

01:40:29.223 --> 01:40:30.858
BUT WHEN WE HAD A PROJECT IN MY

01:40:30.924 --> 01:40:33.160
DISTRICT THAT WAS HELD UP FOR

01:40:33.227 --> 01:40:33.961
FOR FIVE YEARS AND OF IN ITS

01:40:34.027 --> 01:40:35.329
BUILDING IT WASN'T BECAUSE OF

01:40:35.396 --> 01:40:36.663
THE LACK OF STREAMLINING.

01:40:36.730 --> 01:40:37.664
IT WAS BECAUSE THE CASE WAS

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:39.867
HEARD QUICKLY BUT THE JUDGE SAID

01:40:39.933 --> 01:40:41.135
THAT THEY HAD BEEN IN CORRECTING

01:40:41.201 --> 01:40:42.202
THE WAY THE APPROVALS HADN'T

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:44.138
GIVEN AN ISSUE TO STAY AND THIS

01:40:44.204 --> 01:40:45.139
BILL WOULDN'T HELP IN THAT KIND

01:40:45.205 --> 01:40:46.306
OF SITUATION.

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.574
SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF BARRIERS

01:40:47.641 --> 01:40:49.476
HAVING TO DO WITH SEEK WITH IT'S

01:40:49.543 --> 01:40:50.677
NOT ABOUT THE STREAMLINING.

01:40:50.744 --> 01:40:52.379
AND MY OFFER TO YOU WHICH STILL

01:40:52.446 --> 01:40:53.580
STANCES LET'S.

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:54.848
LOOK AT SEEK WELL LET'S HAVE

01:40:54.915 --> 01:40:55.949
HEARINGS AND LOOK AT THOSE

01:40:56.016 --> 01:40:57.317
BARRIERS AND WHAT IS IT THAT'S

01:40:57.384 --> 01:40:58.652
CAUSING.

01:40:58.719 --> 01:41:00.020
THOSE KINDS OF HOLD UPS IS IT A

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:01.688
FAILURE TO GET GENERAL PLANS

01:41:01.755 --> 01:41:02.890
UPDATED.

01:41:02.956 --> 01:41:05.225
IS IT THAT JUDGES ARE STOPPING

01:41:05.292 --> 01:41:06.760
PROJECTS ONE REALLY THEY COULD

01:41:06.827 --> 01:41:08.729
PROCEED WHILE THEY CONTINUE TO

01:41:08.796 --> 01:41:10.397
FIX THOSE DOCUMENTS.

01:41:10.464 --> 01:41:11.298
AND YOU KNOW SEEK WELL AS YOU

01:41:11.365 --> 01:41:13.267
KNOW SEQUEL IS A TOOL FOR

01:41:13.333 --> 01:41:14.701
DECISION MAKERS IT'S NOT A

01:41:14.768 --> 01:41:16.570
DOCUMENT THAT TELLS A DECISION

01:41:16.637 --> 01:41:17.771
MAKER THAT THEY HAVE TO APPROVE

01:41:17.838 --> 01:41:19.206
A PROJECT OR NOT APPROVE IT IT'S

01:41:19.273 --> 01:41:19.840
JUST SUPPOSED TO GIVE

01:41:19.907 --> 01:41:20.908
INFORMATION.

01:41:20.974 --> 01:41:22.142
AND IT NEEDS TO BE AN ACCURATE

01:41:22.209 --> 01:41:23.177
DOCUMENT.

01:41:23.243 --> 01:41:24.378
SO THAT THE DECISION MAKERS CAN

01:41:24.445 --> 01:41:25.779
MAKE THE DECISION ANSWER THAT

01:41:25.846 --> 01:41:27.414
THE COMMUNITIES CAN WAY AND I

01:41:27.481 --> 01:41:28.582
THINK WHAT YOU'VE HEARD.

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:30.284
IS SOME DISQUIET FROM SOME

01:41:30.350 --> 01:41:32.519
COMMUNITY MEMBERS IN THESE AREAS.

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:34.388
THAT THEY FEEL THAT AS LOW

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:35.222
INCOME COMMUNITIES THEY

01:41:35.289 --> 01:41:36.723
SHOULDN'T BE GIVEN SORT OF LESS

01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:38.158
TIME TO WEIGH IN OR DO YOU TO

01:41:38.225 --> 01:41:39.793
HAVE THAT PROCESS THAT THEY WANT.

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:40.994
THE SAME AMOUNT OF PROCESS THAT

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:42.896
OTHER COMMUNITIES GET SO I THINK

01:41:42.963 --> 01:41:47.267
THERE'S A LOT GOING ON HERE.

01:41:47.334 --> 01:41:48.135
BUT I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND.

01:41:48.202 --> 01:41:48.735
WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO AND I

01:41:48.802 --> 01:41:49.336
THINK NO ONE COULD ARGUE WITH

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:49.970
YOUR PASSION FOR BRINGING GOOD

01:41:50.037 --> 01:41:52.005
JOBS AND MORE AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:41:52.072 --> 01:41:54.208
INTO THESE AREAS I THINK WE ALL

01:41:54.274 --> 01:41:54.641
WANT TO DO THAT I?

01:41:54.708 --> 01:41:55.876
I THINK THAT.

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:56.610
THIS AGREEMENT THAT YOU AND I

01:41:56.677 --> 01:41:58.312
ARE HAVING IS WHETHER THIS IS

01:41:58.378 --> 01:41:59.913
GOING TO REALLY ACCOMPLISH THAT

01:41:59.980 --> 01:42:01.281
BUT I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE

01:42:01.348 --> 01:42:02.683
FROM THE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY

01:42:02.749 --> 01:42:04.451
ABOUT WHERE THOSE HANG UPS ARE.

01:42:04.518 --> 01:42:05.486
WHEN THEY HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:06.753
PROPOSED AND OF SEEK WAS A

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:07.521
PROBLEM?

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:09.623
WHAT IS IT?

01:42:09.690 --> 01:42:11.992
THAT IS CAUSING JUDGES. TO AGREE

01:42:12.059 --> 01:42:14.194
WITH LITIGANTS IN SOME CASES AND

01:42:14.261 --> 01:42:15.429
SAY THAT THE SECRET DOCUMENTS

01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:16.663
WERE AN ADEQUATE OR THAT

01:42:16.730 --> 01:42:19.066
SOMETHING KIND OF ONE SIDE WAYS

01:42:19.132 --> 01:42:24.071
IN THE PROCESS -- OR IF IF IT'S

01:42:24.137 --> 01:42:25.639
TAKING LONGER THAN TWO HUNDRED

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:26.607
TWENTY DAYS JUST TO GET INTO THE

01:42:26.673 --> 01:42:28.175
COURT SYSTEM WHAT KIND OF

01:42:28.242 --> 01:42:29.543
RESOURCES DO WE NEED TO GIVE OUR

01:42:29.610 --> 01:42:31.211
COURT SYSTEM. TO HAVE CASES

01:42:31.278 --> 01:42:32.779
DISPENSE WITH MORE QUICKLY

01:42:32.846 --> 01:42:33.780
WITHOUT [inaudible]

01:42:33.847 --> 01:42:35.382
RINGING SOME.

01:42:35.449 --> 01:42:37.417
CASES TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE

01:42:37.484 --> 01:42:39.353
OVER OTHERS -- YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:42:39.419 --> 01:42:40.554
WHAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO

01:42:40.621 --> 01:42:44.391
REALLY HAVE THE DISCUSSION ABOUT --

01:42:44.458 --> 01:42:45.792
SO WITH THAT YOU KNOW I DO LOOK

01:42:45.859 --> 01:42:46.793

AND SOME OF MY LEGISLATION I

01:42:51.098 --> 01:42:52.466
THINK THAT YOU AND I HAVE A LOT

01:42:52.533 --> 01:42:55.168
OF THE SAME GOALS -- SO I

01:42:55.235 --> 01:42:57.037

ARE YOU'RE ALWAYS WELCOME TO

01:42:59.606 --> 01:43:01.308
VENT IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE --

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:02.409
I THINK THAT'S HOW WE GET

01:43:02.476 --> 01:43:04.611
PROGRESS AND YOU KNOW WE DO HAVE

01:43:04.678 --> 01:43:06.647

BUT BUT I DID COMMIT.

01:43:19.259 --> 01:43:22.129
TO HAVING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS --

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:25.365
FRANKLY -- THE CHALLENGE THAT I

01:43:25.432 --> 01:43:27.401
SEE IS THAT -- AS YOU'LL SEE

JUSTICE COMMUNITY IS WE HAVE A

01:43:50.490 --> 01:43:52.125
PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENT AND

01:43:52.192 --> 01:43:54.161
FRANKLY I CAN'T DEAL WITH

01:43:54.227 --> 01:43:55.862
PHILOSOPHICAL DISAGREEMENTS IN A

01:43:55.929 --> 01:43:56.597
BILL.

01:43:56.663 --> 01:43:58.198
I'M EITHER EITHER WE'RE GOING TO

01:43:58.265 --> 01:44:00.534
TRY TO RESOLVE WHAT IS A LONG

01:44:00.601 --> 01:44:02.369
LASTING PROBLEM IN THE STATE OF

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:03.503
CALIFORNIA.

01:44:03.570 --> 01:44:06.239
AND DISAGREE ON ON THE THE WAY

01:44:06.306 --> 01:44:08.108
TO GET THERE OR OR WE SIT DOWN

01:44:08.175 --> 01:44:10.310
AND WE WE WORK ON LANGUAGE IT

01:44:10.377 --> 01:44:11.979
ACTUALLY GET TO US THERE.

01:44:12.045 --> 01:44:13.780
IS TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY DAYS

01:44:13.847 --> 01:44:15.782
A MAGIC NUMBER NO BUT IT'S WHERE

01:44:15.849 --> 01:44:18.852
YOU START AND THEN YOU NEGOTIATE

01:44:18.919 --> 01:44:21.154
AND SO I I'VE ALWAYS I'M GONNA

01:44:21.221 --> 01:44:22.923
GO SHEET OR THAT'S WHAT I DO AND

01:44:22.990 --> 01:44:24.458
SO I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING

01:44:24.524 --> 01:44:25.392
WITH YOU TO SEE.

01:44:25.459 --> 01:44:27.260
IF IT'S THE WRONG APPROACH THIS

01:44:27.327 --> 01:44:28.061
FIGURE OUT WITH THE RIGHT

01:44:28.128 --> 01:44:29.763
APPROACHES BUT I CAN'T IT'S

01:44:29.830 --> 01:44:31.565
IMPOSSIBLE IN LEGISLATION TO

01:44:31.632 --> 01:44:32.866

01:44:32.933 --> 01:44:34.001

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.602
FROM THERE AND SO.

01:44:35.669 --> 01:44:36.570
I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH

01:44:36.637 --> 01:44:40.173
YOU WE I'M I MAY DO THAT PROMISE --

01:44:40.240 --> 01:44:42.075
OBVIOUSLY NOT HAPPY WITH.

01:44:42.142 --> 01:44:43.677
THIS BE IS THIS BEING A TO YOUR

01:44:43.744 --> 01:44:46.613
BILL BUT BUT I I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:44:46.680 --> 01:44:48.815
STAKEHOLDER GROUPS CAN GET TO

01:44:48.882 --> 01:44:50.250
THE BOTTOM OF SOME OF THIS.

01:44:50.317 --> 01:44:52.152
AND IN THE END SOME OF THE DATA

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:54.354
IS GOING TO BE VERY DIFFICULT TO

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:57.991
TO GET BECAUSE THE THREAT OF

01:44:58.058 --> 01:44:59.960
LITIGATION ENDS UP -- CHASING

01:45:00.027 --> 01:45:02.062
OFF PEOPLE THAT WOULD OTHERWISE

01:45:02.129 --> 01:45:03.597
MAKE INVESTMENTS IT'S THE

01:45:03.664 --> 01:45:05.399
MEETINGS I'VE HELD THE ENTIRE

01:45:05.465 --> 01:45:06.900

01:45:08.568 --> 01:45:10.504
CONVERSATION WITH THAT WITH YOU

01:45:10.570 --> 01:45:11.438
BUT IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT HOW

01:45:11.505 --> 01:45:12.873
MANY CASES HAVE BEEN FILED AND

01:45:12.939 --> 01:45:14.775
HOW LONG DID THEY TAKE.

01:45:14.841 --> 01:45:16.276
AND WHAT WAS THE GRANT IF YOU'RE

01:45:16.343 --> 01:45:17.811
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO GET THE DATA

01:45:17.878 --> 01:45:20.847
THAT YOU NEED -- IT IT IT IT.

01:45:20.914 --> 01:45:23.650
IT'S MUCH BIGGER THAN THAT ND

01:45:23.717 --> 01:45:29.189

THE IDEA THAT I WOULD WANT TO

01:45:32.192 --> 01:45:34.061
TRAMPLE.

01:45:34.127 --> 01:45:37.230
ON THE RIGHT OF THE MINORITY

01:45:37.297 --> 01:45:38.632
COMMUNITY PEOPLE OF COLOR COLOR

01:45:38.699 --> 01:45:40.400
I FIND REALLY OFFENSIVE THAT'S

01:45:40.467 --> 01:45:41.935
NOT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:45:42.002 --> 01:45:43.670

CALIFORNIA TILL THE EMPLOYEES.

01:51:21.608 --> 01:51:22.208
THIS BILL WILL REDUCE THE CHANCE

01:51:22.275 --> 01:51:24.577
OF A FUTURE WILDFIRE BECAUSE

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:25.245
UTILITY FAILED TO TRIM THE TREE.

01:51:25.311 --> 01:51:26.212
RIGHT NOW THE THE UTILITY

01:51:26.279 --> 01:51:27.781
DECIDES WHAT TREE TRIMMING IS

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:29.749
NEEDED IT PERFORMS THE WORK AND

01:51:29.816 --> 01:51:31.985
THAT IT OUGHT ITS ITS OWN WORK

01:51:32.052 --> 01:51:33.553
pCONTRACTORS.

01:51:33.620 --> 01:51:35.055
AFTER A FIRE CAL FIRE COMES

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:36.556
ALONG AN INVESTIGATION DECIDES

01:51:36.623 --> 01:51:38.191
WHAT CAUSED THE FIRE AND

01:51:38.258 --> 01:51:39.993
SOMETIMES THESE DECIDE THAT IT

01:51:40.060 --> 01:51:41.494
THE FIRE WAS CAUSED BECAUSE

01:51:41.561 --> 01:51:43.129
SOMEONE FAILED TO TRIM A TREE.

01:51:43.196 --> 01:51:44.130
THAT'S NICE TO KNOW AFTER THE

01:51:44.197 --> 01:51:45.398
FACT IT WOULD BE MUCH BETTER TO

01:51:45.465 --> 01:51:46.733
KNOW WHAT BEFORE THE FACTS

01:51:46.800 --> 01:51:48.435
BEFORE THE FIRE.

01:51:48.501 --> 01:51:49.736
THIS BILL WOULD HAVE CAL FIRE

01:51:49.803 --> 01:51:51.071
AUDIT THE UTILITIES WORK RIGHT

01:51:51.137 --> 01:51:53.506
AWAY BEFORE ANY FIRE AND TELL

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:54.340
THE UTILITY IF IT'S MISSED

01:51:54.407 --> 01:51:55.708
ANYTHING.

01:51:55.775 --> 01:51:58.378
THEN UTILITY HAS A CHANCE TO FIX.

01:51:58.445 --> 01:51:59.512
THE MISTAKE RIGHT AWAY.

01:51:59.579 --> 01:52:01.147
THEN CAL FIRE REPORTS THE

01:52:01.214 --> 01:52:02.715
RESULTS OF ITS AUDIT TO THE PC.

01:52:02.782 --> 01:52:03.983
THIS A GREAT A REALLY POWERFUL

01:52:04.050 --> 01:52:06.219
INCENTIVE THE UTILITY TO FIX

01:52:06.286 --> 01:52:07.420

THEY DON'T.

01:52:10.957 --> 01:52:11.991
THERE'S A PAPER TRAIL THE

01:52:12.058 --> 01:52:14.360
CALIFORNIA TOLD IN THOSE A TREE

INTERNET.

01:52:15.562 --> 01:52:16.396
WHEN I THINK THAT'S GONNA HAPPEN

01:52:16.463 --> 01:52:17.697
WE THINK UTILITY WILL JUMP AND

01:52:17.764 --> 01:52:19.065
EVERY PROBLEM THE CALIFORNIA

01:52:19.132 --> 01:52:20.133

01:52:23.937 --> 01:52:25.805
THE FIRE IS A MUCH BETTER SYSTEM

01:52:25.872 --> 01:52:27.640
THAN SELF AUDITING.

01:52:27.707 --> 01:52:28.741
THIS DOES NOT INCREASE ANY

01:52:28.808 --> 01:52:30.143
EXPENSE FOR CALIFORNIA --

01:52:30.210 --> 01:52:30.844
BECAUSE IT WOULD BE

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:31.878
INAPPROPRIATE BURST BY THE

01:52:31.945 --> 01:52:34.147
UTILITY FOR THE WORK IT DOES IT

01:52:34.214 --> 01:52:35.081
WOULD GREATLY IMPROVE THE

01:52:35.148 --> 01:52:36.616
VEGETATION MANAGEMENT PROCESS

01:52:36.683 --> 01:52:39.219
AND RESULT IN FEWER FIRES CAUSED

01:52:39.285 --> 01:52:40.053
BY MISTAKES AND VEGETATION

I AM VERY HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE

01:57:29.709 --> 01:57:31.411
AMENDMENT TO THE ANALYSIS -- IN

01:57:31.477 --> 01:57:32.979
A MEMBERS IT'S BEEN SO CLEAR I

01:57:33.045 --> 01:57:34.514
THINK TO ALL OF US THAT WE HAVE

01:57:34.580 --> 01:57:36.649
A PLASTICS POLLUTION CRISIS ON

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:37.950
OUR HANDS.

01:57:38.017 --> 01:57:39.152
WE SEE THE PICTURES OF OCEAN

01:57:39.218 --> 01:57:40.853
POLLUTION AND OF DEAD MARINE

01:57:40.920 --> 01:57:43.689
LIFE FOR THE STOMACH FULL OF

01:57:43.756 --> 01:57:46.225
PLASTIC WASHING ON OUR SHORES --

01:57:46.292 --> 01:57:47.493
BUT SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S ONE

01:57:47.560 --> 01:57:48.561
WHOLE ISSUE BUT I I WILL SAY

01:57:48.628 --> 01:57:50.163
THAT IN ADDITION AND OF OF ALSO

01:57:50.229 --> 01:57:51.831
GRAVE IMPORTANCE IS THE EXTENT

01:57:51.898 --> 01:57:53.433
TO WHICH OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

01:57:53.499 --> 01:57:54.767
AND ARE RECYCLERS ARE ARE

01:57:54.834 --> 01:57:56.836
FEELING THE PROBLEM VERY ACUTELY.

01:57:56.903 --> 01:57:57.437
AND I THINK MOST MEMBERS THE

01:57:57.503 --> 01:57:59.305
COMMITTEE KNOW ABOUT CHINA'S

01:57:59.372 --> 01:58:00.440
NATIONAL SORT POLICY THE

01:58:00.506 --> 01:58:01.974
DECISION THAT WAS THEN FOLLOWED

01:58:02.041 --> 01:58:04.076
BY OTHER NATION ASIAN NATIONS.

01:58:04.143 --> 01:58:05.645
TO NO LONGER ACCEPT A RECYCLING.

01:58:05.711 --> 01:58:06.879
AND THIS IS BECAUSE THE BOTTOM

01:58:06.946 --> 01:58:08.381
TO FALL OUT OF OUR RECYCLING

01:58:08.448 --> 01:58:09.715
MARKETS AND IT'S COSTING CITIES

01:58:09.782 --> 01:58:11.117
AND COUNTIES MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:58:11.184 --> 01:58:11.918
CHINA.

01:58:11.984 --> 01:58:14.187
I HAD BEEN ACCEPTING ABOUT 40%

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:15.855
OF OUR RECYCLED MATERIAL FROM

01:58:15.922 --> 01:58:18.624
UNITED STATES IN CALIFORNIA SHE

01:58:18.691 --> 01:58:20.960
WAS A 56%. 76% OF ALL OF OUR

01:58:21.027 --> 01:58:21.594
RECYCLED MATERIAL WAS GOING OFF

01:58:21.661 --> 01:58:24.864
TO CHINA -- AND IN FACT IF YOU

01:58:24.931 --> 01:58:28.434
LOOK AT PLASTICS NUMBERS --

01:58:28.501 --> 01:58:29.235
THREE THREE SEVEN ME THOSE KINDS

01:58:29.302 --> 01:58:30.603
OF PLASTICS WERE FETCHING ABOUT

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:32.205
TWENTY DOLLARS PER TIME.

01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:33.940
IN.

01:58:34.006 --> 01:58:34.740
TWENTY SEVENTEEN NOW LOCAL

01:58:34.807 --> 01:58:36.375
JURISDICTIONS ARE.

01:58:36.442 --> 01:58:37.877
PAYING ARE PAYING.

01:58:37.944 --> 01:58:39.412
ROUGHLY TEN DOLLARS A TIME TO

01:58:39.479 --> 01:58:41.881
DISPOSE OF THREE THREE SEVEN

01:58:41.948 --> 01:58:43.783
PLASTICS -- MORE MORE OFTEN THAT

01:58:43.850 --> 01:58:45.051
MEANS THE MATERIALS JUST SIMPLY

01:58:45.117 --> 01:58:45.585
BEING LANDFILLS BECAUSE IT

01:58:45.651 --> 01:58:46.452
DOESN'T.

01:58:46.519 --> 01:58:48.354
I PAY FOR ITSELF SO WE ARE ALL

01:58:48.421 --> 01:58:50.289
DILIGENTLY SORTING OUR

01:58:50.356 --> 01:58:51.958
RECYCLABLES INTO BLUE BINS --

01:58:52.024 --> 01:58:53.626
BUT UNFORTUNATELY NOW THE

01:58:53.693 --> 01:58:54.727
MATERIAL IS LESS LIKELY TO BE

01:58:54.794 --> 01:58:56.295
PROCESS RECYCLING TODAY THAN IT

01:58:56.362 --> 01:58:57.930
WAS SEVERAL YEARS AGO.

01:58:57.997 --> 01:58:59.265
AND ON TOP OF THE DISPOSAL COSTS

01:58:59.332 --> 01:59:00.800
EVERY YEAR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE

01:59:00.867 --> 01:59:01.667
SPENDING ABOUT HALF A BILLION

01:59:01.734 --> 01:59:02.635
DOLLARS.

01:59:02.702 --> 01:59:04.303
A YEAR IN ONGOING EFFORTS JUST

01:59:04.370 --> 01:59:05.538
TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTER

01:59:05.605 --> 01:59:07.173
IN STREETS AND STORM DRAINS.

01:59:07.240 --> 01:59:08.174
PARKS AND WATERWAYS SO IT'S

01:59:08.241 --> 01:59:11.511
BECOMING A WHOLE NEW TAX.

01:59:11.577 --> 01:59:12.645
THAT IS MONEY THAT COULD BE

01:59:12.712 --> 01:59:15.948
GOING TO LAW ENFORCEMENT -- TO

01:59:16.015 --> 01:59:17.483
IMAGE SERVICES FOR SENIORS GIVEN

01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:21.320
WHATEVER MAY BE.

01:59:21.387 --> 01:59:22.488
NOT SO.

01:59:22.555 --> 01:59:24.190
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOW AT AT AT AND

01:59:24.257 --> 01:59:26.259

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:27.894
WHAT WE GOT TO TAKE BOLD ACTION

01:59:27.960 --> 01:59:30.229
TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS THIS BILL

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:33.065
IS A REALLY IMPORTANT STEP -- IN

01:59:33.132 --> 01:59:34.367
THAT DIRECTION THIS COMMITTEE

01:59:34.433 --> 01:59:35.902
HAS PASSED THE COMPANION

01:59:35.968 --> 01:59:37.270
LEGISLATION IN THE PAST IT WAS

01:59:37.336 --> 01:59:39.505
AB -- TEN EIGHTY IT'S GONNA TAKE

01:59:39.572 --> 01:59:41.040
A SUITE OF TOOLS SUCH AS MINIMUM

01:59:41.107 --> 01:59:42.775
CYCLE CONTENT STANDARDS EXTENDED

01:59:44.410 --> 01:59:46.012
THE RECYCLING MARKETS IN OUR

01:59:46.078 --> 01:59:47.513
STATE MAY COLLECTION RECYCLED

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.248
RECYCLING PROFITABLE AGAIN --

01:59:49.315 --> 01:59:50.616
WHILE ENSURING MANUFACTURERS

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.151
HAVE A STEADY CLEAN SUPPLY OF

01:59:52.218 --> 01:59:53.886
MATERIAL -- THERE'S A LONG

01:59:53.953 --> 01:59:56.422
OFFRAMP ASSOCIATED -- TILL

01:59:56.489 --> 01:59:57.290
TWENTY THIRTY BEFORE IT'S FULLY

01:59:57.356 --> 01:59:58.324
IMPLEMENTED IN THAT WILL

01:59:58.391 --> 01:59:59.959
CERTAINLY ALLOW FOR A LOT OF

BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE'S

02:23:59.297 --> 02:24:01.232
INDUSTRIES OUT THERE THEN THAT'S

02:24:01.299 --> 02:24:02.133
THAT THAT THAT IS THE PRODUCT

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:03.468
THAT PEOPLE ARE USING RIGHT NOW

02:24:03.534 --> 02:24:04.569

WHAT IS COMPOSED OF ALL IN WHAT

02:24:12.910 --> 02:24:14.278
IS NOT WHAT IS THAT YOU KNOW

02:24:14.345 --> 02:24:14.912
WHAT ARE ALL THESE THINGS GOING

02:24:14.979 --> 02:24:15.747
TO BE.

02:24:15.813 --> 02:24:17.415
AND THEN SHOULD REALLY BE THE

02:24:17.482 --> 02:24:18.783
MANUFACTURERS JOB AND I LIKE

02:24:18.850 --> 02:24:20.385
BLACK MANY ANYBODY WHO WORKS IN

02:24:20.451 --> 02:24:21.586
THIS AREA.

WERE TALKING AT SOME POINT CHINA

02:24:29.927 --> 02:24:30.461
IS NOT GOING TO WANT TO TRASH

02:24:30.528 --> 02:24:31.129
RIGHT RIGHT WE SHOULD BE GETTING

02:24:31.195 --> 02:24:32.697
READY A LONG TIME BEFORE AND WE

02:24:32.764 --> 02:24:34.065
DIDN'T AND NOW WE'RE HERE NOW.

02:24:34.132 --> 02:24:36.701
AND SO I'M GUESSING AS WE AS

02:24:36.768 --> 02:24:37.802
WE'RE GONNA SHE STOOD UP THE

02:24:37.869 --> 02:24:42.006
STARTING GUN AS WE'RE DOING THIS.

02:24:42.073 --> 02:24:43.541
THAT WERE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT

02:24:43.608 --> 02:24:44.575
THEIR TIMELINES IN PLACE AND

02:24:44.642 --> 02:24:45.209
PROTECTIONS AND GUARD RAILS IN

02:24:45.276 --> 02:24:46.110
PLACE THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY

02:24:46.177 --> 02:24:47.311
THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO COME BACK

02:24:47.378 --> 02:24:48.246
AND TRY TO REDO.

02:24:48.312 --> 02:24:49.680
UNDO WHAT WE'VE DONE AND WE DO

02:24:49.747 --> 02:24:51.349
SOMETHING ELSE.

02:24:51.416 --> 02:24:52.517
THOSE ARE THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS

02:24:52.583 --> 02:24:53.451
AND I THINK THERE'S A REASONABLE

02:24:53.518 --> 02:24:55.853
CONCERNS -- FOR ANYBODY WHO'S A

02:24:55.920 --> 02:24:57.955
LEGISLATOR INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA

02:24:58.022 --> 02:24:58.723
AND ANYTIME.

02:24:58.790 --> 02:25:00.158
I MEAN HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HEAR

02:25:00.224 --> 02:25:02.126
ABOUT THE A. R. B. BOARD AND AND

02:25:02.193 --> 02:25:04.162
EVERY AGENCY THAT WE GIVE A

02:25:04.228 --> 02:25:05.663
AUTHORITY.

02:25:05.730 --> 02:25:07.398
TO WE OFTEN TIMES AND COMING

02:25:07.465 --> 02:25:08.199
BACK AND SAYING WHO'S MAKING

02:25:08.266 --> 02:25:10.368
DECISIONS IS IT AN AGENCY WAS

02:25:10.435 --> 02:25:13.638
SOMEBODY APPOINTED OR IS ELECTED

02:25:13.704 --> 02:25:14.205
PEOPLE THAT WE SEND THEIR TO

02:25:14.272 --> 02:25:16.908
REPRESENT US.

02:25:16.974 --> 02:25:18.776
I'D GET IT BUT I GUESS BUT WE

02:25:18.843 --> 02:25:20.211
KNOW WHAT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:25:20.278 --> 02:25:23.414
ENDS UP DOING OFTENTIMES IS IS.

02:25:23.481 --> 02:25:24.515
CAN A PIECEMEAL APPROACH WE DO

02:25:24.582 --> 02:25:25.716
ONE OFF BILLS OR BANNING ONE

02:25:25.783 --> 02:25:28.086
PARTICULAR PLASTIC ITEM -- WERE

02:25:28.152 --> 02:25:29.053
WERE WERE BEEN GAUGING IN ONE

02:25:29.120 --> 02:25:31.022
LITTLE PIECE OF THIS BROAD PIE I

02:25:31.089 --> 02:25:32.423
THINK WHAT WE WANT TO DO HERE.

02:25:32.490 --> 02:25:35.860
WAS ACTUALLY MORE HOLISTIC MORE

02:25:35.927 --> 02:25:38.196
MORE -- YEAH MORE REALISTIC IN

02:25:38.262 --> 02:25:38.863
THE IN THIS APPROACH WE'VE GOT A

02:25:38.930 --> 02:25:40.364
GOT A BIG PROBLEM ON OUR HANDS

02:25:40.431 --> 02:25:41.599
AND YOU KNOW I WAS THE TO THE

02:25:41.666 --> 02:25:42.700
ASSEMBLY SUPPORT OF OF THE STRAW

02:25:42.767 --> 02:25:43.901
BALE BUT IN THE END OF THE DAY

02:25:43.968 --> 02:25:46.003
THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST STRAWS

02:25:46.070 --> 02:25:46.804
RIGHT I MEAN IT IT YOU.

02:25:46.871 --> 02:25:48.606
KNOW WE GET WE PASS THAT BILL OR

02:25:51.442 --> 02:25:52.210
UNFORTUNATE NOT GONNA MOVE THE

02:25:52.276 --> 02:25:53.211
ENVELOPE IN A IN A REALLY

02:25:53.277 --> 02:25:55.113
SERIOUS WAY -- AND BY THE WAY I

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:56.214
WILL SAY THAT WE'RE NOT DOING

02:25:56.280 --> 02:25:57.381
AWAY WITH PLASTICS WITH THIS

02:25:57.448 --> 02:25:58.983
BILL WE'RE WE'RE JUST PUSHING

02:25:59.050 --> 02:25:59.851
THESE PRODUCTS.

02:25:59.917 --> 02:26:02.220
TOWARD A MORE SUSTAINABLE PLACE

02:26:02.286 --> 02:26:02.954
AND NOT THAT'S THAT'LL DEALING

02:26:03.020 --> 02:26:04.322
WITH THIS BILL IS ALL ABOUT IT'S

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:05.990
IT'S NOT ACTUALLY ABOUT.

02:26:06.057 --> 02:26:07.558
U. DRAMATICALLY CHANGING EVEN

02:26:07.625 --> 02:26:09.093
CONSUMER BEHAVIOR IT'S JUST THAT

02:26:09.160 --> 02:26:10.561
THAT WE KNOW THERE ARE BETTER

02:26:10.628 --> 02:26:12.663
PRODUCTS OUT THERE IS ACTUALLY

02:26:12.730 --> 02:26:13.598
ALREADY BEING SOLD IN A LOT OF

02:26:13.664 --> 02:26:15.833
PLACES -- BUT THEN THE MARKET A

02:26:15.900 --> 02:26:17.635
LITTLE BIT OF A NUDGE TO PUSH.

02:26:17.702 --> 02:26:19.170
OUR TOWARD MORE SUSTAINABLE MORE

02:26:19.237 --> 02:26:21.606
RECYCLABLE MORE -- REUSABLE

02:26:21.672 --> 02:26:24.242
COMPOSTABLE ALTERNATIVES NO

02:26:24.308 --> 02:26:26.144
THOSE ARE A LITTLE KNOWLEDGE

02:26:26.210 --> 02:26:26.878
THIS IS THE NEXT IS A LITTLE

02:26:26.944 --> 02:26:27.945
MUCH.

02:26:28.012 --> 02:26:28.880
IT IS A LITTLE NUDGE ADVOCATE

02:26:28.946 --> 02:26:29.947
COULD CUT BECAUSE WHAT I BECAUSE

02:26:30.014 --> 02:26:31.015
IF YOU IF YOU HERE.

02:26:31.082 --> 02:26:32.884
I'M EVEN THE BILL FIRST CAME OUT --

02:26:32.950 --> 02:26:34.886
YOU KNOW -- INDUSTRY IS IS

02:26:34.952 --> 02:26:37.088
ALREADY MOVING VERY DIRECTLY IN

02:26:37.155 --> 02:26:38.689
THIS DIRECTION -- AND VERY

02:26:38.756 --> 02:26:40.758
PURPOSEFULLY I ACTUALLY THINK IT

02:26:40.825 --> 02:26:42.793
WILL BENEFIT AN ADVANTAGE A LOT

02:26:42.860 --> 02:26:44.362
OF HOME GROWN CALIFORNIA

02:26:44.428 --> 02:26:45.897
MANUFACTURERS WHO HAVE ALREADY

02:26:45.963 --> 02:26:47.331
MADE A LOT OF PROGRESS IN THIS

02:26:47.398 --> 02:26:48.266
AREA OVER.

02:26:48.332 --> 02:26:49.800
MANUFACTURES FROM OTHER PARTS OF

02:26:49.867 --> 02:26:51.302
THE WORLD WHO MAY BE LESS

02:26:51.369 --> 02:26:51.936
SUSTAINABLE IN THEIR BUSINESS

02:26:52.003 --> 02:26:55.439
PRACTICES I THINK THAT'S WHY --

02:26:55.506 --> 02:26:56.340
YEAH THERE'S OBVIOUSLY CONCERNED

02:26:56.407 --> 02:26:57.808
ABOUT ANY ATTEMPT BY THE

02:26:57.875 --> 02:26:59.243
LEGISLATURE TO STEP IN AND

02:26:59.310 --> 02:27:00.978
REGULATE A CERTAIN ASPECT OF THE

02:27:01.045 --> 02:27:02.246
WAY THAT WE MANUFACTURE THINGS

02:27:02.313 --> 02:27:03.614
BUT I DO THINK.

02:27:03.681 --> 02:27:05.616
THAT THAT THE THE SAVVY FOLKS ON

02:27:05.683 --> 02:27:07.552
THE BUSINESS SIDE -- WHO HAVE

02:27:07.618 --> 02:27:09.153
BEEN ENGAGING VERY ROBUSTLY WITH

02:27:09.220 --> 02:27:10.721
US AND IN THIS DISCUSSION

02:27:10.788 --> 02:27:12.456
UNDERSTAND THEY'RE ACTUALLY SOME

02:27:12.523 --> 02:27:13.758
REAL BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES HERE?

02:27:13.824 --> 02:27:16.060
FOR SUSTAINABLY ORIENTED --

02:27:16.127 --> 02:27:17.929
CALIFORNIA BUSINESSES SOMETHING

02:27:17.995 --> 02:27:18.930
WITH WITH WHAT HAPPENED WITH

02:27:18.996 --> 02:27:19.564
SOLAR RIGHT I MEAN THERE WAS A

02:27:19.630 --> 02:27:20.631
MOMENT AT WHICH SOLAR WAS SO

02:27:20.698 --> 02:27:21.599
EXPENSIVE IN THERE THAT NOBODY

02:27:21.666 --> 02:27:22.967
COULD IMAGINE.

02:27:23.034 --> 02:27:24.202
THAT WOULD BE THE PLACE NOW I

02:27:24.268 --> 02:27:25.336
WAS JUST AT MY FRIEND'S HOUSE.

02:27:25.403 --> 02:27:26.137
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT IN PLACE

02:27:26.204 --> 02:27:27.471
SOLAR PANELS ON THEIR HOUSE AND

02:27:27.538 --> 02:27:28.272
THEY'VE ACTUALLY PENCIL OUT

02:27:28.339 --> 02:27:29.407
ABOUT HOW IT'S GOING TO SAVE THE

02:27:29.473 --> 02:27:31.542
MONEY -- YOU KNOW WITHIN ABOUT

02:27:31.609 --> 02:27:32.643
FIVE SIX YEARS.

02:27:32.710 --> 02:27:33.844
AND THAT THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:27:33.911 --> 02:27:42.486
UNTHINKABLE TWENTY YEARS AGO

02:27:42.553 --> 02:27:44.255
RIGHT TO BE TWENTY YEARS AGO.

02:27:44.322 --> 02:27:44.889
EVERYBODY YOU KNOW WHAT IT WAS

02:27:44.956 --> 02:27:45.523
JUST SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE BY

02:27:45.590 --> 02:27:46.657
PEOPLE WHO HAD A LOT OF MONEY TO

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:47.491
BURN AND WANTED TO MAKE A POINT --

02:27:47.558 --> 02:27:48.326
NOW WE'VE ACTUALLY YOU THROUGH A

02:27:48.392 --> 02:27:48.926
KIND A COMBINATION OF MARKET

02:27:48.993 --> 02:27:51.395
FORCES AND GOVERNMENTAL REGULAR

02:27:51.462 --> 02:27:52.029
YOU KNOW GOVERNMENTAL NAY JING

02:27:52.096 --> 02:27:53.831
HEY WE'VE GOT NO PLACE WHERE

02:27:53.898 --> 02:27:54.432
SOULS ACTUALLY NOW STARTING TO

02:27:54.498 --> 02:27:54.665
BECOME.

02:27:54.732 --> 02:27:55.633
AFFORDABLE FOR PEOPLE I THINK

02:27:55.700 --> 02:27:56.867
SIMILARLY -- WE'RE WHAT WE'RE

02:27:56.934 --> 02:27:58.769
DOING HERE IS YOU KNOW IF YOU

02:27:58.836 --> 02:28:00.104
VIRGIN PLASTIC IS JUST SO CHEAP

02:28:00.171 --> 02:28:00.738
IT'S SO CHEAP.

02:28:00.805 --> 02:28:01.439
THERE ARE THERE ALTERNATIVES

02:28:01.505 --> 02:28:02.540
THAT ARE THAT ARE SIGNIFICANTLY

02:28:02.607 --> 02:28:05.776
BETTER FOR THE ENVIRONMENT THAT

02:28:05.843 --> 02:28:08.246
ARE JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE.

02:28:08.312 --> 02:28:09.146
BUT BUT COMPANIES JUST DON'T

02:28:09.213 --> 02:28:10.047
HAVE THE INCENTIVE TO MOVE

02:28:10.114 --> 02:28:10.681
TOWARD THOSE PRODUCTS.

02:28:10.748 --> 02:28:13.384
I AM ACTUALLY IF WE CAN HELP TO

02:28:13.451 --> 02:28:15.052
TO PUSH.

02:28:15.119 --> 02:28:16.854
WE CAN WE CAN WE TO PUSH PEOPLE

02:28:16.921 --> 02:28:17.722
THOSE DIRECTIONS WE CAN TAKE

02:28:17.788 --> 02:28:19.090
ADVANTAGE OF ECONOMIES OF SCALE

02:28:19.156 --> 02:28:21.092
DROP THE PRICES AND ACTUALLY.

02:28:21.158 --> 02:28:22.326
GIVEN THE FACT THAT PEOPLE ALL

02:28:22.393 --> 02:28:23.294
OVER THE WORLD KNOW THEY NEED TO

02:28:23.361 --> 02:28:25.529
ADDRESS THIS CRISIS AS WELL.

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:27.732
I A IS MORE ENTITIES MORE

02:28:27.798 --> 02:28:28.833
JURISDICTIONS ADOPT THIS SORT OF

02:28:28.899 --> 02:28:30.534
MODEL WILL HELP TO DRIVE DOWN

02:28:30.601 --> 02:28:33.137
PRICES -- OVERALL I SAID OVER

02:28:33.204 --> 02:28:35.840
AND OVER AGAIN I WOULD CONSIDER

02:28:35.906 --> 02:28:36.674
THIS EFFORT TO BE A FAILURE.

02:28:36.741 --> 02:28:38.242
IF WE PASS A GREAT BILL HERE IN

02:28:38.309 --> 02:28:41.045
CALIFORNIA BUT WE DO SO -- IN A

02:28:41.112 --> 02:28:42.613
WAY THAT IMPACTS OUR ECONOMY

02:28:42.680 --> 02:28:44.815
SUCH THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS

02:28:44.882 --> 02:28:46.050
OUT WON'T WANT TO ADOPT SIMILAR

02:28:46.117 --> 02:28:47.485
MODELS I THINK AT THE HEART OF

02:28:47.551 --> 02:28:48.352
THIS.

02:28:48.419 --> 02:28:50.087
IS SHOWING THAT WE CAN CONTINUE

02:28:50.154 --> 02:28:51.656
THE PROGRESS THAT WE'VE MADE

02:28:51.722 --> 02:28:52.957
BOTH IN TERMS OF DOING THE RIGHT

02:28:53.024 --> 02:28:54.792
BY ENVIRONMENT AND ALSO GROWING

02:28:54.859 --> 02:28:55.960
ECONOMICALLY.

02:28:56.027 --> 02:28:57.628
AND DOING RIGHT BY CONSUMERS

02:28:57.695 --> 02:28:59.163
ONLY WITH THE WITHOUT TRY FACT

02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:01.098
AND PLACE WILL BE ABLE TO TRULY

02:29:01.165 --> 02:29:02.933
SELL THIS MODEL TO OTHER STATES

02:29:03.000 --> 02:29:04.201
AND OTHER NATIONS.

02:29:04.268 --> 02:29:05.002
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE HAVE

02:29:05.069 --> 02:29:06.170
TO DO HERE I MEAN ULTIMATELY

02:29:06.237 --> 02:29:07.905
CALIFORNIA IT IS AN IMPORTANT

02:29:07.972 --> 02:29:09.140
PLACE AND I LOVE TO DO THE RIGHT

02:29:09.206 --> 02:29:10.541
THING ENVIRONMENTALLY HERE BUT

02:29:10.608 --> 02:29:11.709
THIS IS ALL ABOUT TRYING TO

02:29:11.776 --> 02:29:13.911
SCALE THIS MODEL GLOBALLY. TO

02:29:13.978 --> 02:29:16.914
REALLY MAKE A A REAL DIFFERENCE

02:29:16.981 --> 02:29:18.115
GRAHAM AND I THINK WE ALL AGREE

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:19.884
WITH THAT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY

02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:23.220
IS IMPORTANT TO GET IT RIGHT.

02:29:23.287 --> 02:29:25.856
BECAUSE I'LL I WILL ALSO SAY.

02:29:25.923 --> 02:29:27.124
I'M GOING TO THE SMALL CABIN OFF

02:29:27.191 --> 02:29:27.758
THE GRID RIGHT NOW WITH SOLAR IT

02:29:27.825 --> 02:29:28.726
DOESN'T WORK.

02:29:28.793 --> 02:29:29.560
RIGHT AND I CAN'T GET ANYBODY UP

02:29:29.627 --> 02:29:30.761
THERE TO FIX IT BECAUSE IT'S TOO

02:29:30.828 --> 02:29:32.830
FAR OFF THE GRID AND SO FOR

02:29:32.897 --> 02:29:33.964
EVERYTHING THAT WE SAY THE ME

02:29:34.031 --> 02:29:35.066
GREAT EVERYBODY'S GONNA DO IT.

02:29:35.132 --> 02:29:36.233
THERE ARE PROBLEMS INHERENT IN

02:29:36.300 --> 02:29:38.035
IT AND I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I SIT

02:29:38.102 --> 02:29:39.770
HERE AND STRUGGLE WITH.

02:29:39.837 --> 02:29:40.538
THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE HERE AND

02:29:40.604 --> 02:29:42.506
THAT AND THAT THE MANUFACTURERS

02:29:42.573 --> 02:29:44.141
HAVE TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

02:29:44.208 --> 02:29:45.710
RESALE PRODUCT OF THAT

02:29:45.776 --> 02:29:46.510
RECYCLABILITY.

02:29:46.577 --> 02:29:47.845
BECAUSE THOSE ARE TWO SEPARATE

02:29:47.912 --> 02:29:49.180
MARKET YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:29:49.246 --> 02:29:51.048
RIGHT WHO MAKES IT AND WHAT AND

02:29:51.115 --> 02:29:52.016
BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE LOOKING

02:29:52.083 --> 02:29:53.484
FOR MARKETS ALL OVER THE WORLD

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:55.386
ON THIS ALL THE TIME. TO THAT

02:29:55.453 --> 02:29:56.153
HAVE THOSE TWO THINGS TIED

02:29:56.220 --> 02:29:56.954
TOGETHER.

02:29:57.021 --> 02:29:58.656
I ALSO THINK IT'S PROBLEMATIC SO

02:29:58.723 --> 02:30:00.257
I I APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS

02:30:00.324 --> 02:30:01.158
I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THOSE

02:30:01.225 --> 02:30:02.793
WORKING IN THIS SPACE WE NEED TO

02:30:02.860 --> 02:30:05.162
CONTINUE THE WORK.

02:30:05.229 --> 02:30:05.763
BUT I REALLY BELIEVE THAT YOU

02:30:05.830 --> 02:30:10.868
NEED TO HAVE A WE GOT IT RIGHT

02:30:10.935 --> 02:30:11.869
AND I THINK IT ADVOCATING TO AN

02:30:11.936 --> 02:30:12.803
OUTSIDE AGENCY IS ALWAYS MORE

02:30:12.870 --> 02:30:14.171
PROBLEMATIC WITHOUT REAL CHECKS

02:30:14.238 --> 02:30:15.806
AND BALANCES WITH US WITHOUT

02:30:15.873 --> 02:30:17.641
TIMELINES IT CLEARLY DELINEATE

02:30:17.708 --> 02:30:18.709
WHEN THIS IS COPING PLAN WHEN

02:30:18.776 --> 02:30:19.610

02:30:19.677 --> 02:30:19.944
INFORMATION.

02:30:20.010 --> 02:30:21.612
ON THAT AND THEN WHEN IT TO THE

02:30:21.679 --> 02:30:23.314
REGULATIONS GOING TO AFFECT AND

02:30:23.381 --> 02:30:23.881
THEN.

02:35:32.056 --> 02:35:33.524
WERE SPECIFIC QUESTIONS ABOUT

02:35:33.590 --> 02:35:35.359
SOME OF THE LANGUAGE IN HERE WE

02:35:35.426 --> 02:35:36.627

BEYOND 75%.

02:35:40.698 --> 02:35:41.165
YEAH AND I ASK MYSELF THE

02:35:41.231 --> 02:35:42.866

02:35:46.570 --> 02:35:47.104
THAT WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THEM

02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:48.205
ALL THIS POWER.

02:35:48.272 --> 02:35:50.374
WHY ARE WE NOT GIVEN THE POWER

02:35:50.441 --> 02:35:52.376
IN BOTH DIRECTIONS UP OR DOWN --

02:35:52.443 --> 02:35:54.445
FOR FOR THAT FOR THAT RATE -- IN

02:35:54.511 --> 02:35:56.246
SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER AS

02:35:56.313 --> 02:35:58.415
WE TALK ABOUT GIVING THEM POWER

02:35:58.482 --> 02:35:59.583

02:36:15.699 --> 02:36:16.400
SPECIFIC AUTHORITY AND SO I

02:36:16.467 --> 02:36:17.634
THINK THAT IT WE'RE GOING TO

02:36:17.701 --> 02:36:18.635
GIVE THEM AUTHORITY INCLUDING

02:36:18.702 --> 02:36:19.803

BOTH THE UP AND THE DOWN IN YOUR

02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:32.583
LAN WHICH ALLOWS FOR THE UP.

02:36:32.649 --> 02:36:33.217

02:39:01.198 --> 02:39:01.765
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE'RE

02:39:01.832 --> 02:39:03.533
TALKING ABOUT FOOD SAFETY THAT

02:39:03.600 --> 02:39:04.801
WE'RE ALSO TALKING ABOUT THE

02:39:04.868 --> 02:39:06.370
POTENTIAL FOR FOOD WASTE AND

02:39:06.436 --> 02:39:08.038
THAT WE'RE NOT CREATING MORE

02:39:08.105 --> 02:39:10.874
FOOD WASTE AS A CONSEQUENCE.

02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:19.716
ALONG THE WAY -- AND FOR LACK OF

02:39:19.783 --> 02:39:21.251
A BETTER EXAMPLE OF OF THE FOOD

02:39:21.318 --> 02:39:21.852
WASTE I THIS IS MAYBE NOT THE

02:39:21.919 --> 02:39:22.986
BEST EXAMPLE HERE BUT IT'S IT'S

02:39:23.053 --> 02:39:23.754
IT'S SOMETHING I ENCOUNTER

02:39:23.820 --> 02:39:25.022
REGULARLY S. I'M EATING.

02:39:25.088 --> 02:39:27.090
AND BUYING ORGANICS AND THE

02:39:27.157 --> 02:39:27.891
SHELF LIFE THAT THEY HAVE AND I

02:39:27.958 --> 02:39:28.525
LIVE BY MYSELF IN SACRAMENTO AND

02:39:28.592 --> 02:39:30.027
I FIND MYSELF AT THE END OF THE

02:39:30.093 --> 02:39:31.395
WEEK LIKE.

02:39:31.461 --> 02:39:32.129
ARE COMING BACK ON MONDAY WITH

02:39:32.195 --> 02:39:33.363
MY FOOD NOT BEING GOOD ANYMORE

02:39:33.430 --> 02:39:34.798
RIGHT AND SO I WANT THE ORGANIC

02:39:34.865 --> 02:39:35.432
STUFF BUT IT'S CREATED THIS TWO

02:39:35.499 --> 02:39:36.033
WAYS FOR ME ON A REGULAR BASIS

02:39:36.099 --> 02:39:37.634
BUT I HAVE. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:39:37.701 --> 02:39:39.836
DO BETTER ABOUT SO FOR LACK OF A

02:39:39.903 --> 02:39:40.904
BETTER EXAMPLE BUT IT'S A

02:39:40.971 --> 02:39:42.739
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES TO A

02:39:42.806 --> 02:39:43.540
VERY GOOD DEAL I THINK WE NEED

02:39:43.607 --> 02:39:44.508
TO BE.

02:39:44.574 --> 02:39:46.076
TALKING ABOUT THAT AS WE

02:39:46.143 --> 02:39:46.977
CONTINUE TO ADDRESS THE FOOD

02:39:47.044 --> 02:39:48.145
SAFETY PIECES THAT YOU'VE

02:39:48.211 --> 02:39:49.346
STARTED TO ADDRESS AND STOP I DO

02:39:49.413 --> 02:39:50.247
WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE AND GIVE YOU

02:39:50.314 --> 02:39:52.015
CREDIT. FOR THAT AND THEN THE

02:39:52.082 --> 02:39:53.550
LAST THING AS I WAS READING THIS

02:39:53.617 --> 02:39:56.019
THIS BILL -- WAS THE PART ON

02:39:56.086 --> 02:39:57.654
ENFORCEMENT WITHIN CLEAR TO ME

02:39:57.721 --> 02:39:58.455
THAT THERE WAS ANY SORT OF

02:39:58.522 --> 02:39:59.489
ENFORCEMENT OR TEETH.

02:39:59.556 --> 02:40:01.391
IN AND THIS BILL RIGHT NOW AND I

02:40:01.458 --> 02:40:03.327
GET THAT THAT MIGHT BE THAT THAT

02:40:03.393 --> 02:40:04.695
WHILE THEY'RE STILL OPPOSITION

02:40:04.761 --> 02:40:06.096
AND WE HAVEN'T FIGURED OUT OTHER

02:40:06.163 --> 02:40:07.364
IMPORTANT PIECES THAT MIGHT BE

02:40:07.431 --> 02:40:08.665
THE HARDEST ONE TO FIGURE OUT.

02:40:08.732 --> 02:40:10.334
BUT I I DO THINK THAT WE NEED

02:40:10.400 --> 02:40:11.902
SOME SORT OF ENFORCEMENT

02:40:11.969 --> 02:40:14.438
MECHANISM -- AND IN THIS BILL AT

02:40:14.504 --> 02:40:16.239
SOME POINT.

02:40:16.306 --> 02:40:18.141
HOT AND SO THOSE ARE IS THE TERM

02:40:18.208 --> 02:40:19.876
I AM HOPING SOME VERY SPECIFIC --

02:40:19.943 --> 02:40:21.611
SMALL AND BIG THINGS THAT I'M

02:40:21.678 --> 02:40:23.046
LOOKING AT IN THIS BILL AS IT

02:40:23.113 --> 02:40:24.715
MOVES FORWARD ON INSTEAD OF JUST

02:40:24.781 --> 02:40:25.649
TELLING YOU FIGURE IT OUT THIS

02:40:25.716 --> 02:40:27.017
ARE ITEMS THAT I WOULD LIKE TO

02:40:27.084 --> 02:40:28.085
SEE FIGURE IT OUT BEFORE.

02:40:28.151 --> 02:40:30.454
THE NEXT LIFE OF OF THIS BILL

02:40:30.520 --> 02:40:31.555
WHICH IS NOT TODAY I UNDERSTAND

02:40:31.621 --> 02:40:34.091
THAT -- THE LAST THING IS I

02:40:34.157 --> 02:40:35.625
WANTED AYE I HAD HEARD FROM THE

02:40:35.692 --> 02:40:38.095
OPPOSITION ABOUT THE ADVANCE

02:40:38.161 --> 02:40:39.796
RECYCLE FEE PROPOSAL.

02:40:39.863 --> 02:40:41.164
ON AND I WILL SAY THAT WHEN

02:40:41.231 --> 02:40:42.299
SOMEONE COMES TO TELL ME THAT WE

02:40:42.366 --> 02:40:43.100
WANT TO GIVE YOU MONEY TO GET

02:40:43.166 --> 02:40:44.401
SOMETHING GOING AND WE HAVE TO

02:40:44.468 --> 02:40:45.469
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET THIS

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:47.637
MARKET GOING BECAUSE IT'S I

02:40:47.704 --> 02:40:48.905
DON'T UNDER I DON'T WANT THINGS

02:40:48.972 --> 02:40:50.273
TO BE RECYCLABLE.

02:40:50.340 --> 02:40:51.408
BUT THEN NO ONE WANTS TO USED TO

02:40:51.475 --> 02:40:52.876
RECYCLE CONTENT SO -- WHAT'S

02:40:52.943 --> 02:40:54.945
YOUR OPINION ABOUT THIS ADVANCE

02:40:55.012 --> 02:40:57.447
RECYCLE FEE PROPOSAL AND WHY YOU

02:40:57.514 --> 02:41:00.517
AREN'T -- AREN'T IT ON THE

02:41:00.584 --> 02:41:01.551
SUPPORT OF IT BECAUSE I'VE AND

02:41:01.618 --> 02:41:11.895
NOT SOMETHING THAT THE CHEMISTRY

02:41:11.962 --> 02:41:12.329
COUNCIL BROUGHT UP.

02:41:12.396 --> 02:41:14.231
CORRECT.

02:41:14.297 --> 02:41:14.998
ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

02:41:15.065 --> 02:41:15.198
YEAH.

02:41:15.265 --> 02:41:17.567
YEAH -- WE'RE THIS IS PART OF

02:41:17.634 --> 02:41:18.235
OUR DISCUSSIONS THIS SUMMER -- I

02:41:18.301 --> 02:41:20.103
THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED.

02:41:20.170 --> 02:41:21.204
TO I FULLY UNDERSTAND THE

02:41:21.271 --> 02:41:22.272
IMPLICATIONS HOW IT IN A PLACE

02:41:22.339 --> 02:41:22.873
WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS ARE

02:41:22.939 --> 02:41:24.307
TRYING TO DO WITH THE BILL --

02:41:24.374 --> 02:41:24.908
BUT YEAH IT'S ON THE TABLE AND

02:41:24.975 --> 02:41:28.078
AND WE'RE WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT

02:41:28.145 --> 02:41:28.912
AND LOOKING AT I MEAN THE

02:41:28.979 --> 02:41:29.713
REALITY IS THAT DEVELOPING THIS

02:41:29.780 --> 02:41:32.282
MARKET'S GONNA COST MONEY RIGHT

02:41:32.349 --> 02:41:34.751
AND WE SEE -- AFTER I'M NOT AND

02:41:34.818 --> 02:41:35.385
I'M NOT ASKING ABOUT A STORAGE

02:41:35.452 --> 02:41:36.386
OF COUNSEL BECAUSE THAT'S THE

02:41:36.453 --> 02:41:37.454
WAY TO COME UP WITH MONEY TO AND

02:41:37.521 --> 02:41:38.555
THEY HAVEN'T ALL BEEN WORKING AT

02:41:38.622 --> 02:41:40.557
THE STATE VERY WELL EITHER SO --

02:41:40.624 --> 02:41:41.491
BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY THESE

02:41:41.558 --> 02:41:45.228
THINGS BECAUSE MONEY WHETHER

02:41:45.295 --> 02:41:46.897
IT'S FROM A FEE.

02:41:46.963 --> 02:41:48.565
THAT PEOPLE VOLUNTARILY YOU KNOW

02:41:48.632 --> 02:41:49.966
PROVIDER FEE WE IMPOSE OR AT THE

02:41:50.033 --> 02:41:50.934
END OF THE DAY FOR THE GENERAL

02:41:51.001 --> 02:41:52.202
FUND WHERE WE HAVE GOALS ON

02:41:52.269 --> 02:41:53.770
ORGANICS OUT THERE WERE HAVING

02:41:53.837 --> 02:41:54.304
TO PUT ADDITIONAL MONIES.

02:41:54.371 --> 02:41:54.938
IN FROM OUR GENERAL FUND FROM

02:41:55.005 --> 02:41:55.605
CAP AND TRADE TO GET THAT MARKET

02:41:55.672 --> 02:41:56.606
GOING WE KNOW THAT THE MARKET'S

02:41:56.673 --> 02:41:57.307
GOING TO TAKE SOME REAL MONEY TO

02:41:57.374 --> 02:41:58.008
DEVELOP.

02:41:58.075 --> 02:41:59.910
AND SO WHEN I HEAR SOMEONE

02:41:59.976 --> 02:42:01.978
WANTING TO OFFER AS A HUNDRED

02:42:02.045 --> 02:42:02.612
MILLION AND WHEN THEY OFF WHEN

02:42:02.679 --> 02:42:04.181
THEY SAID I WAS LIKE WELL MAYBE

02:42:04.247 --> 02:42:05.615
WE NEED MORE THAN THAT MAYBE

02:42:05.682 --> 02:42:07.918
THAT'S NOT ENOUGH THAT IF YOU'RE

02:42:07.984 --> 02:42:08.552
GOING TO OFFER ME CAN YOU OFFER

02:42:08.618 --> 02:42:08.819
ME MORE.

02:42:08.885 --> 02:42:10.320
BUT I WILL SAY THAT.

02:42:10.387 --> 02:42:11.088
IT'S RARE THAT WE HAVE FOLKS

02:42:11.154 --> 02:42:12.456
COMING OFFERS MANY LIKE THAT TO

02:42:12.522 --> 02:42:13.690
PAY FOR SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW

02:42:13.757 --> 02:42:14.658
WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A

02:42:14.724 --> 02:42:15.892
WAY TO HELP PAY FOR THIS.

02:42:15.959 --> 02:42:17.894

02:42:17.961 --> 02:42:19.529
DISCUSSION ABOUT THE MONEY

UP WITH THE SOME POINT.

02:42:21.598 --> 02:42:23.133
IT IF WE DON'T HAVE THEM PAY FOR

02:42:23.200 --> 02:42:24.835
THE TAXPAYERS WILL BE PAYING FOR

02:42:24.901 --> 02:42:25.368
IT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS

02:42:25.435 --> 02:42:27.204
SUCCESSFUL AND I THINK WE NEED

02:42:27.270 --> 02:42:28.038

02:42:28.105 --> 02:42:34.478

BUT I HAVE I MEAN I'M SURE THE

02:48:49.953 --> 02:48:50.787
FROM A CALL THE COMMITTEE WE

HAVE SEEN A COUPLE BILLS.

02:48:52.622 --> 02:48:54.190
THAT HAVE BEEN VERY PRESCRIPTIVE

02:48:54.257 --> 02:48:55.558
ABOUT THE WAY THAT WE'RE GONNA

OUT IN THE FUTURE.

02:49:03.500 --> 02:49:04.033
AND ONE OF THINGS WE STRUGGLED

02:49:04.100 --> 02:49:04.868
WITH WHEN WE'RE LOOKING AT THOSE

02:49:04.934 --> 02:49:06.636
BILLS WAS THE QUESTION OF WELL

02:49:06.703 --> 02:49:08.671

YOU KNOW.

02:49:10.173 --> 02:49:11.140
WHO WOULD HAVE IMAGINED DID

02:49:11.207 --> 02:49:11.808
TWENTY YEARS AGO WE WOULD ALL BE

02:49:11.875 --> 02:49:13.076
WALKING AROUND WITH THE COMPUTER

02:49:13.142 --> 02:49:14.844
IN OUR POCKETS THE SIZE OF THE?

02:49:14.911 --> 02:49:15.645
YOU KNOW THE COMPUTER THAT

02:49:15.712 --> 02:49:16.813
BROUGHT THE FIRST MAN TO THE

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:19.516
MOON -- IT THINGS CHANGE NEEDS

02:49:19.582 --> 02:49:23.353
CHANGE OUR ISSUES CHANGE AND AND

02:49:23.419 --> 02:49:25.088
WHAT WE WANTED TO DO WITH WITH

02:49:25.154 --> 02:49:26.923
THIS BILL WAS PROVIDE ADEQUATE

02:49:26.990 --> 02:49:28.424
FLEXIBILITY SO THAT.

02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:29.759
I'VE AS THE WORLD CHANGES AND

02:49:29.826 --> 02:49:32.328
PERHAPS DRAMATICALLY OF NEXT

02:49:32.395 --> 02:49:32.996
FIVE TEN TWENTY YEARS THERE WILL

02:49:33.062 --> 02:49:35.365
BE AT LEAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS --

02:49:35.431 --> 02:49:37.333
THERE WERE THERE WILL BE YEAH --

02:49:37.400 --> 02:49:38.434
ANY AGENCY THAT AND AND STAY IN

02:49:38.501 --> 02:49:39.602
THIS THIS CONTINUING PROCESS

02:49:39.669 --> 02:49:41.671
WHEREBY PEOPLE WILL BE ABLE. TO

02:49:41.738 --> 02:49:43.706
TO RECALIBRATE AND TWEAK AND

02:49:43.773 --> 02:49:44.207
CHANGE.

02:49:44.274 --> 02:49:45.808
ON UNLIKE SOME OF THE OTHER

02:49:45.875 --> 02:49:47.844
BILLS THAT HAVE COME THROUGH

02:49:47.911 --> 02:49:49.679
THAT THAT REALLY ARE ARE SO.

02:49:49.746 --> 02:49:51.314
THEY'RE VERY PRESCRIPTIVE AND

02:49:51.381 --> 02:49:53.216
THEY'RE VERY MUCH BASED ON OUR

02:49:53.283 --> 02:49:54.183
CURRENT.

02:49:54.250 --> 02:49:58.221
THINKING ABOUT THE WAY THE WORLD

02:49:58.288 --> 02:49:59.822
WORKS.

02:49:59.889 --> 02:50:02.091
AND SO -- FLEXIBILITY IS THE KEY

02:50:02.158 --> 02:50:03.459
WITH WITH KIND OF A A STRONG SET

02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:04.460
OF OF GOALS IN MIND.

02:50:04.527 --> 02:50:06.663
AND THAT'S THAT'S I THINK WHAT'S

02:50:06.729 --> 02:50:08.932
AT THE HEART OF THE OF THE BILL

02:50:08.998 --> 02:50:10.600
NOW I YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S

02:50:10.667 --> 02:50:11.968
WHAT MAKES THE BILL SO STRONG I

02:50:12.035 --> 02:50:13.870
I ALSO YOU KNOW WHAT PART OF THE

02:50:13.937 --> 02:50:15.238
QUESTIONS WE JUST GOT TODAY.

02:50:15.305 --> 02:50:16.606
THE FLEXIBILITY LEADS TO A

02:50:16.673 --> 02:50:18.207
CERTAIN CONCERN OVER VAGUENESS

02:50:18.274 --> 02:50:20.610
SORT FOR OUR LACK OF SPECIFICITY

02:50:20.677 --> 02:50:22.345
THAT WE'VE WE'VE GRAPPLED WITH

02:50:22.412 --> 02:50:23.246
AS THE BILL'S MAYBE MEETS WAY

02:50:23.313 --> 02:50:24.814
THROUGH.

02:50:24.881 --> 02:50:26.249
THE MORE SPECIFICITY WE PUT IN.

02:50:26.316 --> 02:50:27.183
THE MOREWE MAY BE TYING THE

02:50:27.250 --> 02:50:29.085
HANDS OF THE PROCESS IN WAYS

02:50:29.152 --> 02:50:30.053
THAT ACTUALLY MAY BE

02:50:30.119 --> 02:50:32.088
DISADVANTAGEOUS TO BOTH THE

02:50:32.155 --> 02:50:36.159
BARBELL SIDE OR THE OR INDUSTRY --

02:50:36.225 --> 02:50:36.726
AND THAT'S WHY I THINK WE'VE

02:50:36.793 --> 02:50:40.697
BEEN A LITTLE RELUCTANT -- TO

02:50:40.763 --> 02:50:42.765
YOU KNOW. TO TO TO TO TO TAKE

02:50:42.832 --> 02:50:44.634
AWAY THE FLEXIBILITY MORE THAN

02:50:44.701 --> 02:50:45.201
WE'VE WITH THEM WITH THAT WE

02:50:45.268 --> 02:50:46.369
THAT WE NEED.

02:50:46.436 --> 02:50:51.107
TO THAT MAKES SENSE YEAH.

02:50:51.174 --> 02:50:54.210
THANK YOU FOR FONG.

LARGE PART OF YOUR WORK IS

02:53:35.071 --> 02:53:36.472
WORKING ON THIS BILL.

02:53:36.539 --> 02:53:41.978
I FOR ONE APPRECIATE THE ART THE

02:53:42.044 --> 02:53:44.180
WAY THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO TACKLE

02:53:44.247 --> 02:53:45.615
THIS WHICH IS BY GIVING.

02:53:45.681 --> 02:53:48.684
GOALS THAT VAN GIVE THE AGENCIES

02:53:48.751 --> 02:53:50.419
FLEXIBILITY AS TO AND THE

02:53:50.486 --> 02:53:52.088
INDUSTRY AS TO HOW TO ACHIEVE

02:53:52.155 --> 02:53:53.856
THOSE GOALS RATHER THAN BEING

02:53:53.923 --> 02:53:54.390
PRESCRIPTIVE.

02:53:54.457 --> 02:53:56.559
IT'S THE SAME TACK THAT WAS

02:53:56.626 --> 02:53:58.294
TAKING WITH SB THIRTY TWO AND

02:53:58.361 --> 02:53:59.462
IT'S WORKED EXTREMELY WELL

02:53:59.529 --> 02:54:00.663
BETTER THAN WE HAD EVER PLAN

02:54:00.730 --> 02:54:01.998
BECAUSE IT DOES HAVE THAT

02:54:02.064 --> 02:54:05.301
FLEXIBILITY BUILT INTO THE WAYS

02:54:05.368 --> 02:54:06.169
THE CURSOR MATT.

02:54:06.235 --> 02:54:09.472
I'M KIND OF LIKE -- SB THIRTY

02:54:09.539 --> 02:54:10.039
TWO I ALSO.

02:54:10.106 --> 02:54:12.375
LOOK AT THE IMPACTS THAT

02:54:12.441 --> 02:54:12.909
PLASTICS HAVE HAD IN OUR

02:54:12.975 --> 02:54:14.310
ENVIRONMENT YOU KNOW BOTH IN

02:54:14.377 --> 02:54:15.745
TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW TO

02:54:15.812 --> 02:54:17.713
OUR OCEANS WHICH IS REALLY HIT

02:54:17.780 --> 02:54:19.515
DRASTIC LEVELS AND I THINK A LOT

02:54:19.582 --> 02:54:21.317
OF PEOPLE ARE IN DENIAL ABOUT

02:54:21.384 --> 02:54:22.718
THE EFFECTS THAT THAT'S HAVING.

02:54:22.785 --> 02:54:24.220
BUT THEY'RE HAVING INCREDIBLY

02:54:24.287 --> 02:54:25.721
NEGATIVE A FAX AND IF WE DON'T

02:54:25.788 --> 02:54:28.391
HAVE AN OCEAN WITH ON THE PLANET --

02:54:28.457 --> 02:54:29.759
THE FACT THAT NOW THERE'S

02:54:29.826 --> 02:54:31.694
PLASTICS DETECTABLE IN PEOPLE'S

02:54:31.761 --> 02:54:32.562
BLOOD.

02:54:32.628 --> 02:54:35.164
IN THE BLOOD OF UNBORN FETUSES

02:54:35.231 --> 02:54:35.865
WITH AND WE DON'T KNOW THE

02:54:35.932 --> 02:54:37.366
HEALTH IMPACT ABOUT EVEN THOUGH

02:54:37.433 --> 02:54:38.968
WE KNOW PLASTICS ARE POWERFUL

02:54:39.035 --> 02:54:40.269
ENDOCRINE DISRUPTORS WHEN WE

02:54:40.336 --> 02:54:41.170
TALK ABOUT.

02:54:41.237 --> 02:54:43.172
THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF AND FOOD

02:54:43.239 --> 02:54:45.141
SAFETY WELL I WOULD ARGUE THAT

02:54:45.208 --> 02:54:46.542
THERE'S MORE SAFETY FROM HAVING

02:54:46.609 --> 02:54:48.177
CLASSICS AROUND FOOD THAN AROUND

02:54:48.244 --> 02:54:51.280
NOT HAVING PLASTICS AROUND FOOD.

02:54:51.347 --> 02:54:51.848
AND THAT'S BECOMING MORE AND

02:54:51.914 --> 02:54:52.481
MORE CLEAR.

02:54:52.548 --> 02:54:54.584
SO GIVEN ALL OF THOSE

02:54:54.650 --> 02:54:56.185
ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS I DON'T

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:57.019
THINK THAT YOU CAN LOOK AT

02:54:57.086 --> 02:54:59.088
PLASTICS IN ANY OTHER WAY THAN

02:54:59.155 --> 02:55:02.892
AS A HAZARD HAZARDOUS PRODUCT.

02:55:02.959 --> 02:55:03.526
AND IT'S A HAZARDOUS PRODUCT TO

02:55:03.593 --> 02:55:04.093
OUR PLANET.

02:55:04.160 --> 02:55:05.695
THAT HAS BEEN DUMPED INTO OUR

02:55:05.761 --> 02:55:06.729
COMMUNITIES.

02:55:06.796 --> 02:55:08.664
WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT IT'S

02:55:08.731 --> 02:55:11.167
THE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE THE

02:55:11.234 --> 02:55:11.767
RESPONSIBILITY OF DEALING WITH

02:55:11.834 --> 02:55:12.401
IT.

02:55:12.468 --> 02:55:13.836
AND RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THAT OUR

02:55:13.903 --> 02:55:15.238
COMMUNITIES HAVE A HUGE

02:55:15.304 --> 02:55:17.139
FINANCIAL IMPACT OF HAVING TO

02:55:17.206 --> 02:55:18.708
DEAL WITH THE WITH THE PLASTICS

02:55:18.774 --> 02:55:19.942
THAT COME INTO THE COMMUNITY.

02:55:20.009 --> 02:55:21.844
BECAUSE SO FAR THE MANUFACTURERS

02:55:21.911 --> 02:55:23.012
IN THE INDUSTRY HAS REALLY DONE

02:55:23.079 --> 02:55:25.581
VERY LITTLE. TO HELP OFFSET THE

02:55:25.648 --> 02:55:27.283
INCREDIBLE EXPENSE THAT OUR

02:55:27.350 --> 02:55:28.684
COMMUNITIES HAVE IN.

02:55:28.751 --> 02:55:30.753
THE FACT OR TAXPAYERS HAVE AS

02:55:30.820 --> 02:55:33.789
THEY PAY FOR THEIRS THERE WERE

02:55:33.856 --> 02:55:33.990
THERE.

02:55:34.056 --> 02:55:35.091
ARE TRASH.

02:55:35.157 --> 02:55:36.158
FEES WHICH NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO

02:55:36.225 --> 02:55:36.792
UP AND UP AND UP BECAUSE THEY

02:55:36.859 --> 02:55:38.127
HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS TOXIC

02:55:38.194 --> 02:55:39.896
MATERIAL AND DEAL WITH TRYING TO

02:55:39.962 --> 02:55:41.097
KEEP IT OUT OF THE WATER WAYS IN

02:55:41.163 --> 02:55:42.565
THOSE OF US WHO WORK.

02:55:42.632 --> 02:55:44.767
ON RIVERS AND HAVE STORM DRAINS

02:55:44.834 --> 02:55:46.802
THAT DRAIN INTO THE OCEAN OUR

02:55:46.869 --> 02:55:48.938
PERSONALLY HAVING YOU KNOW THE

02:55:49.005 --> 02:55:50.039
THE CITIES HAVE TO PAY FOR THAT.

02:55:50.106 --> 02:55:51.607
AND THE COMMUNITIES HAVE TO PAY

02:55:51.674 --> 02:55:52.608
FOR THE CLEAN UP IN THE IMPACT

02:55:52.675 --> 02:55:54.143
OF LITTER SO THERE'S BEEN

02:55:54.210 --> 02:55:55.544
TREMENDOUS IMPACTS.

02:55:55.611 --> 02:55:58.114
AND THE INDUSTRY HAS HAD MANY

02:55:58.180 --> 02:55:58.915
YEARS TO DEAL WITH THIS THEY'VE

02:55:58.981 --> 02:55:59.482
HAD.

02:55:59.548 --> 02:56:01.250
DOT YOU KNOW DOZENS AND DOZENS

02:56:01.317 --> 02:56:03.119
OF YEARS AND YET WE HAVEN'T SEEN

02:56:03.185 --> 02:56:04.787
ANY REAL MEANING.

02:56:04.854 --> 02:56:06.088
FOR MOVEMENT IN FACT IT'S GONE

02:56:06.155 --> 02:56:07.857
THE OTHER DIRECTION AS ASIAN

02:56:07.924 --> 02:56:09.025
DOESN'T WANT PLASTICS DUMPED ON

02:56:09.091 --> 02:56:10.760
THEM.

02:56:10.826 --> 02:56:11.994
WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE IN THE

02:56:12.061 --> 02:56:13.162
AMOUNT OF PLASTICS THAT ARE

02:56:13.229 --> 02:56:14.463
COMING INTO THE ENVIRONMENT MY

02:56:14.530 --> 02:56:16.032
GOING TO THE GROCERY STORE MORE

02:56:16.098 --> 02:56:17.934
MORE PLASTICS BEING FORCED ON ME

02:56:18.000 --> 02:56:19.335
AS A CONSUMER OF FOOD OR OTHER

02:56:19.402 --> 02:56:20.970
PRODUCTS.

02:56:21.037 --> 02:56:22.672
WHEN WE GET OUR LITTLE PINS YOU

02:56:22.738 --> 02:56:23.773
KNOW THAT WE GET ALL THE TIME UP

02:56:23.839 --> 02:56:25.241
HERE FROM DIFFERENT GROUPS THERE

02:56:25.308 --> 02:56:26.842
MORE MORE THEY'RE WRAPPED IN

02:56:26.909 --> 02:56:28.377
PLASTIC FOR SOME UNKNOWN REASON?

02:56:28.444 --> 02:56:29.845
SO I DON'T SEE AN INDUSTRY

02:56:29.912 --> 02:56:31.814
THAT'S TAKEN MUCH RESPONSIBILITY%

02:56:31.881 --> 02:56:33.115
BUT I SEE THESE INCREDIBLY

02:56:33.182 --> 02:56:35.551
HARMFUL EFFECTS OF THIS PRODUCT

02:56:35.618 --> 02:56:36.485
WE DIDN'T ASK WITH ALL DUE

02:56:36.552 --> 02:56:37.787
RESPECT WE DON'T ASK THE COAL

02:56:37.853 --> 02:56:39.255
INDUSTRY TO BE AT THE TABLE WITH

02:56:39.322 --> 02:56:41.691
US WITH AT WITH SB.

02:56:41.757 --> 02:56:43.693
THIRTY TWO WE SAID THESE AREGOALS USUALLY THE VALUES OF

02:56:43.759 --> 02:56:45.461
CALIFORNIA THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE

02:56:45.528 --> 02:56:46.762
TO DO TO PROTECT OUR

02:56:46.829 --> 02:56:47.964
CONSTITUENTS TO PROTECT OUR

02:56:48.030 --> 02:56:49.065
CHILDREN.

02:56:49.131 --> 02:56:50.533
AND YOU GUYS GO FIGURE OUT HOW

02:56:50.599 --> 02:56:52.234
TO ACHIEVE THAT AND ASKING THEM

02:56:52.301 --> 02:56:53.369
TO TAKE THE RESPONSIBILITY AND

02:56:53.436 --> 02:56:54.804
CREATE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY TO

02:56:54.870 --> 02:56:57.006
REDUCE WASTE IN A MEANINGFUL WAY.

03:08:58.393 --> 03:08:59.928
THOSE TRUCKS THAN IT DOES FROM

03:08:59.995 --> 03:09:01.863
THE CARS YET WE REQUIRE CARS

03:09:01.930 --> 03:09:03.298
WHEN THEY REACH A CERTAIN AGE TO

03:09:03.365 --> 03:09:04.966
GO IN AND GET SMOG BUT THERE IS

03:09:05.033 --> 03:09:06.601
NO COMPREHENSIVE INSPECTION AND

03:09:06.668 --> 03:09:08.203
MAINTENANCE PROGRAM. FOR HEAVY

03:09:08.270 --> 03:09:10.038
DUTY TRUCKS RUNNING ON DIESEL

03:09:10.105 --> 03:09:11.907
FUEL AND THE IMPORTANCE OF THE

03:09:11.973 --> 03:09:13.675
INSPECTION MAINTENANCE IS THAT

03:09:13.742 --> 03:09:15.844
TESTS HAVE SHOWN THAT.

03:09:15.911 --> 03:09:17.713
A LOT OF THESE TRUCKS ARE

03:09:17.779 --> 03:09:20.215
ACTUALLY HAVING EMISSIONS THAT

03:09:20.282 --> 03:09:22.050
ARE SEVERAL TIMES HIGHER THAN

03:09:22.117 --> 03:09:23.585
THE EMISSIONS THAT THE ENGINES

03:09:23.652 --> 03:09:25.187
ARE CERTIFIED.

03:09:25.253 --> 03:09:27.556
TO SO IT'S ONE THING TO HAVE A

03:09:27.622 --> 03:09:30.158
TRUCK A BE REQUIRED TO HAVE AN

03:09:30.225 --> 03:09:32.060
ENGINE OF A CERTAIN VINTAGE TO

03:09:32.127 --> 03:09:33.495
HAVE A DIESEL PARTICULATE FILTER

03:09:33.562 --> 03:09:35.030
BUT IT'S ANOTHER TO ACTUALLY GO

03:09:35.097 --> 03:09:36.765
IN AND CHECK AND MAKE SURE THAT

03:09:36.832 --> 03:09:38.366
THE EMISSIONS ARE WHAT THEY'RE

03:09:38.433 --> 03:09:39.468
SUPPOSED TO BE.

03:09:39.534 --> 03:09:40.736
AND THE MUNICIPAL UTILITIES

03:09:40.802 --> 03:09:42.304
ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN CLAIMING

03:09:42.370 --> 03:09:44.439
THAT THEY'RE ALREADY REGULATED

03:09:44.506 --> 03:09:45.474
FOR THIS PURPOSE WELL THEY'RE

03:09:45.540 --> 03:09:47.576
NOT THEY DON'T HAVE AN

03:09:47.642 --> 03:09:49.177
INSPECTION MAINTENANCE PROGRAM --

03:09:49.244 --> 03:09:50.879
NOBODY DOES CURRENTLY BEYOND THE

03:09:50.946 --> 03:09:53.582
CHECK FOR VISIBLE SMOKE.

03:09:53.648 --> 03:09:55.717
SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS

03:09:55.784 --> 03:09:57.018
ACTUALLY ALREADY PART OF THE

03:09:57.085 --> 03:09:58.687
STATE'S PLAN FOR COMING INTO

03:09:58.754 --> 03:10:00.122

03:10:02.724 --> 03:10:04.926
IMPORTANT TO CLEAN UP THE SMOG

03:10:04.993 --> 03:10:06.628
IN PARTICULAR POLLUTION THAT WE

03:10:06.695 --> 03:10:08.230
CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM AROUND

03:10:08.296 --> 03:10:10.198
THE STATE THERE'S A LOT WE NEED

03:10:10.265 --> 03:10:11.566
TO DO TO CLEAN UP DIESEL

03:10:11.633 --> 03:10:12.467
POLLUTION.

03:10:12.534 --> 03:10:14.035
THIS IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE AND

03:10:14.102 --> 03:10:16.204

BACKBONE OF OUR FREIGHT SYSTEM

WHICH IS A MAJOR ENGINE FOR OUR

03:10:51.940 --> 03:10:53.341
STATE'S ECONOMY HOWEVER THERE

03:10:53.408 --> 03:10:54.242
THEY ALSO LIMITED

03:10:54.309 --> 03:10:55.544
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

03:11:10.225 --> 03:11:11.026
CREATES A COMPETITIVE

03:11:11.092 --> 03:11:13.195
DISADVANTAGE FOR THE FLEET TO

03:11:16.331 --> 03:11:17.566
THE CURRENT LACK OF SMOG CHECKS

03:11:17.632 --> 03:11:19.234
EQUATES TO AN UNFAIR TAX ON

03:11:19.301 --> 03:11:20.836

STANDARD.

03:11:30.745 --> 03:11:31.580

MANY FLEETS BY STOPPING THOSE

03:11:33.481 --> 03:11:35.851

CHECKS.

03:11:47.062 --> 03:11:48.396
IMPORTANTLY IT SENDS OUT A

03:11:48.463 --> 03:11:50.232

CONCERNS REGARDING THE BILL.

03:11:56.171 --> 03:11:57.105
AND OBVIOUSLY CAR WOULD

ULTIMATELY HAVE TO DETERMINE THE

03:11:58.607 --> 03:12:00.075

03:15:05.393 --> 03:15:06.861
HAPPEN IS.

03:15:06.928 --> 03:15:09.264

THEY WOULD HAVE TO BE PULLED

03:21:17.832 --> 03:21:18.833
INDEPENDENT OPERATOR LET'S SAY

03:21:18.900 --> 03:21:20.168
WHO STILL MIGHT NEED TO GET FOOD

03:21:20.234 --> 03:21:21.803
OUT OF A PROCESSING PLANT BEFORE

03:21:21.869 --> 03:21:23.838
THE FOOD GOES BAD -- AND SOME OF

03:21:23.905 --> 03:21:25.773
THAT AGRICULTURAL FLEETS YOU

03:21:25.840 --> 03:21:27.542
KNOW CAN HAVE A HUNDRED TRUCKS

03:21:27.608 --> 03:21:29.677
IN THEM -- YOU KNOW AS OPPOSED

03:21:29.744 --> 03:21:30.511
TO SOMEONE WORKING OUT OF THE

03:21:30.578 --> 03:21:32.079
PORTS MAYBE IT'S ONE PERSON WITH

03:21:32.146 --> 03:21:33.581
ONE TRUCK AND THEY'RE NOT HAVING

03:21:33.648 --> 03:21:35.950
QUITE THE KIND OF LEEWAY THAT

03:21:36.017 --> 03:21:37.185

TO THE AGRICULTURAL -- TRUCKERS

03:21:39.187 --> 03:21:41.622
SO I JUST SORT OF QUESTION THAT

03:21:41.689 --> 03:21:42.290
YOU KNOW ON THE BASIS OF

03:21:42.356 --> 03:21:43.991
FAIRNESS BUT SOMETHING ELSE TO

03:21:44.058 --> 03:21:45.259
CONSIDER AS YOU MOVE FORWARD

03:21:45.326 --> 03:21:48.596
MAYBE HAVING A LITTLE BIT.

03:21:48.663 --> 03:21:49.297
LESS.

03:21:49.363 --> 03:21:50.164
CHARITY WITH THE LARGER FLEETS

03:21:50.231 --> 03:21:51.065
BECAUSE IF YOU'VE GOT A HUNDRED

03:21:51.132 --> 03:21:51.866
FIFTY TRUCKS.

03:21:51.933 --> 03:21:53.134
IN ROTATION YOU STILL SHOULD BE

03:21:53.201 --> 03:21:54.402
ABLE TO CYCLE THEM THROUGH TO

03:21:54.469 --> 03:21:55.770
DEAL WITH ALL THE ISSUES YOU

03:21:55.837 --> 03:21:57.071
KNOW ON THE FARM HOPEFULLY OR

03:21:57.138 --> 03:21:58.239
YOU HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO

03:21:58.306 --> 03:21:59.507
AT LEAST MAINTAIN THEM TO WHERE

03:21:59.574 --> 03:22:00.441
THEY CAN PASS.

03:22:00.508 --> 03:22:02.477
OR YOU TEST THEM BEFORE YOUR

03:22:02.543 --> 03:22:05.046
SEVENTY TWO DAY WINDOW -- BUT

03:22:05.112 --> 03:22:06.180
THE POINT IS WE'RE NOT GIVING

03:22:06.247 --> 03:22:08.983
THAT SAME DISCRETION TO AN AN AN

03:22:09.050 --> 03:22:09.550

FOOD ON THEIR TABLE I'M GIVING

03:22:13.187 --> 03:22:14.922

03:22:14.989 --> 03:22:16.190
THERE'S JUST SORT OF A?

03:22:16.257 --> 03:22:17.525

03:23:00.067 --> 03:23:00.801
SAID BECAUSE I'M GETTING A

03:23:00.868 --> 03:23:02.403
LITTLE BIT FIRED UP SO YOU KNOW

03:23:02.470 --> 03:23:03.804
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL WE

03:23:03.871 --> 03:23:05.239
DIDN'T SEE THE MOUNTAINS -- THE

03:23:05.306 --> 03:23:07.241
WE HAD SMOG DAYS EVERY DAY AND I

03:23:07.308 --> 03:23:09.477
WAS IN THE EARLY SEVENTIES AND

03:23:09.544 --> 03:23:10.711
IT WOULDN'T SOME PEOPLE COME

03:23:10.778 --> 03:23:11.812
TRAVEL TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

03:23:11.879 --> 03:23:12.313
NINETY MINUTE THERE ARE

03:23:12.380 --> 03:23:13.681
MOUNTAINS THERE AND WE'VE BEEN

03:23:13.748 --> 03:23:15.783
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF WORK NOT

03:23:15.850 --> 03:23:17.018
MYSELF BUT OTHERS.

03:23:17.084 --> 03:23:18.519
SO WE SEE THE MOUNTAINS ALMOST

03:23:18.586 --> 03:23:19.620
EVERY DAY NOW IN SOUTHERN

03:23:19.687 --> 03:23:21.622
CALIFORNIA BUT THE AIR QUALITY

03:23:21.689 --> 03:23:23.958
IS JUST AS BAD AND IT'S BECAUSE

03:23:24.025 --> 03:23:25.626
THE PARTICULATES ARE SMALLER --

03:23:25.693 --> 03:23:27.762
WHEN I LAND IN ONTARIO SOMETIMES

03:23:27.828 --> 03:23:29.497
I LOOK ON MY HANDY DANDY APT TO

03:23:29.564 --> 03:23:31.132

LANDED ON TERRIO ITS SAYS?

03:23:34.835 --> 03:23:37.438
ERROR UNHEALTHY FOR SOME GROUPS

03:23:37.505 --> 03:23:39.273
SO WE ARE DOING SOMETHING WRONG

03:23:39.340 --> 03:23:40.975
AND I THINK THIS BILL GOES A

03:23:41.042 --> 03:23:42.143
LONG WAY.

03:23:42.209 --> 03:23:44.278
