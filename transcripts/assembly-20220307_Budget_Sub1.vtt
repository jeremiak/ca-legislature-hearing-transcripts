00:32:17.035 --> 00:32:18.569
SUBSTANCE USE AMONG CALIFORNIA'S

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:20.938
PEOPLE. AND THIS IS TRUE ACROSS

00:32:21.005 --> 00:32:22.940
THE LIFESPAN AND UNFORTUNATELY

00:32:23.007 --> 00:32:25.410
IT WILL DISPROPORTIONATELY

00:32:25.476 --> 00:32:27.478
IMPACT UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES.

00:32:27.545 --> 00:32:29.580
ALL OF THIS BEING SAID THERE ARE

00:32:29.647 --> 00:32:31.149
INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.950
CHANGE E'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT

00:32:33.017 --> 00:32:36.020
SEVERAL OF THEM TODAY- THERE IS

00:32:36.087 --> 00:32:38.256
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NINE

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:39.757
EIGHT EIGHT HOTLINE. THERE ARE

00:32:39.824 --> 00:32:41.959
THE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS

00:32:42.026 --> 00:32:43.628
THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE AND

00:32:43.695 --> 00:32:44.395
WILL CONTINUE TO BE MADE SO THAT

00:32:44.462 --> 00:32:46.264
WE CAN CREATE A SYSTEM IN WHICH

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.999
MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES ARE

00:32:48.066 --> 00:32:50.435
AVAILABLE IN MEDIC CAL AND FOR

00:32:50.501 --> 00:32:52.003
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WITH THAT

00:32:52.070 --> 00:32:54.072
85% FEDERAL MATCH. WE ARE

00:32:54.138 --> 00:32:56.274
LEARNING EVERY DAY THE CAPACITY

00:32:56.341 --> 00:32:58.076
THAT WE HAVE TO REACH PEOPLE

00:32:58.142 --> 00:33:00.445
WITH OUR CAL HOPE PROGRAM. AND

00:33:00.511 --> 00:33:02.513
ABOVE ALL SOMETHING I BELIEVE

00:33:02.580 --> 00:33:03.715
DEEPLY AND IS THE CRITICAL

00:33:03.781 --> 00:33:05.783
IMPORTANCE OF PEER SUPPORT AND

00:33:05.850 --> 00:33:07.318
WHAT ARE THE OTHER THINGS THAT

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:09.020
WE COULD BE DOING IN CALIFORNIA

00:33:09.087 --> 00:33:11.823
TO PREVENT CRISIS IN THE FIRST

00:33:11.889 --> 00:33:14.192
PLACE. LAST WEEK PRESIDENT BIDEN

00:33:14.258 --> 00:33:16.127
ANNOUNCED A STRATEGY TO ADDRESS

00:33:16.194 --> 00:33:17.061
THE NATIONAL MENTAL HEALTH

00:33:17.128 --> 00:33:19.130
CRISIS AND IT'S AND IT'S PART OF

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.799
HIS UNITY AGENDA. SPECIFICALLY

00:33:21.866 --> 00:33:22.600
IDENTIFIED THAT THE FEDERAL

00:33:22.667 --> 00:33:25.536
BUDGET. WILL PROPOSE SEVEN

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:27.138
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP

00:33:27.205 --> 00:33:29.407
ESTATE STAFF OF OUR CRISIS CALL

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:33.144
CENTERS AND SHORE UP GAPS IN.

00:33:33.211 --> 00:33:36.381
OUR NINE EIGHT EIGHT SYSTEM. SO

00:33:36.447 --> 00:33:38.516
YOU ASK THE ADMINISTRATION WHAT

00:33:38.583 --> 00:33:40.385
ARE OUR PLANS TO IMPLEMENT THESE

00:33:40.451 --> 00:33:42.320
OPPORTUNITIES AND I'D LIKE TO

00:33:42.387 --> 00:33:44.756
SHARE WITH YOU I'M A LITTLE BIT

00:33:44.822 --> 00:33:46.124
ABOUT WHAT WE'LL BE DOING HERE

00:33:46.190 --> 00:33:47.592
AT HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND

00:33:47.658 --> 00:33:49.193
I KNOW THAT- OUR DEPARTMENT OF

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.062
HEALTH CARE SERVICES HERE. AND

00:33:51.129 --> 00:33:52.463
WE'LL TALK ABOUT SOME MORE THESE

00:33:52.530 --> 00:33:56.000
COMPONENTS IN SPECIFIC DETAIL.

00:33:56.067 --> 00:33:58.403
THIS IS A VERY DYNAMIC SPACE

00:33:58.469 --> 00:33:59.704
CERTAINLY IN MY CAREER I'VE

00:33:59.771 --> 00:34:01.572
NEVER EXPERIENCED SO MANY THINGS

00:34:01.639 --> 00:34:03.541
HAPPENING IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:05.510
AND THAT IS REALLY EXCITING. BUT

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:06.611
WE WANTED TO BE REALLY

00:34:06.677 --> 00:34:08.613
THOUGHTFUL ABOUT THIS AND AS WE

00:34:08.679 --> 00:34:10.448
SAW ALL THESE OPPORTUNITIES

00:34:10.515 --> 00:34:12.216
COMING OUR WAY QUITE QUICKLY

00:34:12.283 --> 00:34:15.486
FRANKLY WE FELT THAT. AT AGENCY

00:34:15.553 --> 00:34:17.555
WOULD BE WELL POSITIONED TO WORK

00:34:17.622 --> 00:34:19.190
WITH OUR DEPARTMENTS TO WORK

00:34:19.257 --> 00:34:20.391
WITH OUR NATIONAL STATE AND

00:34:20.458 --> 00:34:22.193
LOCAL GOVERNMENTAL PARTNERS OR

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.295
STAKEHOLDERS AND ADVOCATES. TO

00:34:24.362 --> 00:34:26.230
PLAN FOR THIS WORK WITHIN THE

00:34:26.297 --> 00:34:28.599
CONTEXT OF BOTH CURRENT AND

00:34:28.666 --> 00:34:31.636
PROPOSED INVESTMENTS IN

00:34:31.702 --> 00:34:32.637
PREVENTING AND RESPONDING TO

00:34:32.703 --> 00:34:34.138
CRISIS. SO SPECIFICALLY WE'RE

00:34:34.205 --> 00:34:36.040
GOING TO BUILD OFF OF EXISTING

00:34:36.107 --> 00:34:37.275
PLANNING EFFORTS THAT HAVE BEEN

00:34:37.341 --> 00:34:40.011
UNDER WAY TO BUILD THE CAPACITY

00:34:40.077 --> 00:34:41.546
TO REACH THE VISION THAT WAS

00:34:41.612 --> 00:34:43.014
INTENDED BY THE FEDERAL

00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.482
LEGISLATION THAT CREATED NINE

00:34:44.549 --> 00:34:45.583
EIGHT EIGHT. AND SO THE

00:34:45.650 --> 00:34:46.918
ADMINISTRATION IS GOING TO

00:34:46.984 --> 00:34:48.319
LAUNCH INTO A PROCESS OF

00:34:48.386 --> 00:34:49.987
DEVELOPING A BLUEPRINT BY THE

00:34:50.054 --> 00:34:52.557
END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR SO IT

00:34:52.623 --> 00:34:55.493
IS GOING TO BE A SPRINT. THAT

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.561
WILL ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING

00:34:56.627 --> 00:34:58.062
ISSUES. WE WILL IDENTIFY A

00:34:58.129 --> 00:35:00.498
STATEWIDE VISION FOR A SET OF

00:35:00.565 --> 00:35:01.265
SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE

00:35:01.332 --> 00:35:03.601
EXPERIENCING CRISIS. INCLUDING

00:35:03.668 --> 00:35:05.636
THE INTERACTION BETWEEN NINE

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:06.938
EIGHT EIGHT AND NINE ONE ONE.

00:35:07.004 --> 00:35:08.606
MEDI CAL MOBILECRISIS RESPONSE

00:35:08.673 --> 00:35:10.541
CRISIS RECEIVING FACILITIES AND

00:35:10.608 --> 00:35:11.976
LONG TERM CRISIS RESIDENTIAL

00:35:12.043 --> 00:35:13.778
SERVICES WE WILL ARTICULATE A

00:35:13.845 --> 00:35:15.413
STATEWIDE MINIMUM SET OF

00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:17.548
STANDARDS. AND IDENTIFY METRICS

00:35:17.615 --> 00:35:19.517
TO MEASURE THE STANDARDS. WE

00:35:19.584 --> 00:35:21.352
WILL IDENTIFY MODELS MORE

00:35:21.419 --> 00:35:23.554
SPECIFICALLY PROTOTYPES OF HOW

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:25.156
STATEWIDE SERVICES COULD BE

00:35:25.223 --> 00:35:27.358
IMPLEMENTED LOCALLY I THINK THIS

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:29.961
IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT AND

00:35:30.027 --> 00:35:30.995
IT'S ALSO COMPLICATED BUT-

00:35:31.062 --> 00:35:32.230
SOMETHING THAT I FEEL THAT WE

00:35:32.296 --> 00:35:33.865
CAN DO TOGETHER. PARTICULARLY

00:35:33.931 --> 00:35:35.199
WITH MANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.868
THAT WILL BE SPEAKING LATER ON

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:39.003
THIS PANEL WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.571
THE DIFFERENT MODELS ARE GOING

00:35:40.638 --> 00:35:41.472
TO BE NEEDED IN DIFFERENT

00:35:41.539 --> 00:35:43.441
COUNTIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT

00:35:43.508 --> 00:35:44.709
SAID IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE

00:35:44.775 --> 00:35:46.511
CAN'T HAVE A BASIC STATE WIDE

00:35:46.577 --> 00:35:50.181
STANDARD- AND THEN WE CAN WORK

00:35:50.248 --> 00:35:52.250
TO GET THERE OVER TIME. WE ALSO

00:35:52.316 --> 00:35:53.384
WILL PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL

00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:55.219
OVERVIEW OF THE RESOURCES THAT

00:35:55.286 --> 00:35:57.255
WILL BE REQUIRED AND OR HOW WE

00:35:57.321 --> 00:35:58.356
COULD USE OUR CURRENT AND

00:35:58.422 --> 00:36:00.858
PROPOSED INVESTMENTS. TO SUPPORT

00:36:00.925 --> 00:36:03.628
THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A ROBUST

00:36:03.694 --> 00:36:05.396
CRISIS CARE RESPONSE SYSTEM. WE

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:07.298
WILL OUTLINE A GOVERNANCE MODEL

00:36:07.365 --> 00:36:09.166
TO SUPPORT FUTURE IMPLEMENTATION

00:36:09.233 --> 00:36:10.668
I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT AGENCY

00:36:10.735 --> 00:36:12.537
WE HAVE TWELVE DEPARTMENTS FIVE

00:36:12.603 --> 00:36:14.171
OFFICES. WE LIAISON WITH

00:36:14.238 --> 00:36:15.540
CALLAWAY YES IN OTHER

00:36:15.606 --> 00:36:17.308
DEPARTMENTS. I THINK IT'S REALLY

00:36:17.375 --> 00:36:18.342
IMPORTANT FOR EVERYBODY HAVE A

00:36:18.409 --> 00:36:19.777
GOOD UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THEIR

00:36:19.844 --> 00:36:21.712
ROLE AND RESPONSIBILITY IS AND

00:36:21.779 --> 00:36:23.247
HAVING A ROBUST CRISIS RESPONSE

00:36:23.314 --> 00:36:27.051
SYSTEM. WILL IDENTIFY. AND I

00:36:27.118 --> 00:36:28.786
THINK MOST IMPORTANTLY. WE WILL

00:36:28.853 --> 00:36:30.922
IDENTIFY MAJOR MILESTONES IT'S

00:36:30.988 --> 00:36:33.591
BASICALLY THE HOW TO AND I SAY

00:36:33.658 --> 00:36:35.960
THIS BECAUSE- WE ARE. IT'LL TAKE

00:36:36.027 --> 00:36:37.762
SEVERAL YEARS TO GET TO WHERE WE

00:36:37.828 --> 00:36:39.530
WANT TO GO AND I THINK IT'S

00:36:39.597 --> 00:36:41.432
IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:42.867
WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE THIS YEAR

00:36:42.934 --> 00:36:45.102
NEXT YEAR FIVE YEARS TEN YEARS.

00:36:45.169 --> 00:36:47.471
SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO ALIGN

00:36:47.538 --> 00:36:49.373
OUR OVER ARCHING INVESTMENTS IN

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.442
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES WITH

00:36:51.509 --> 00:36:53.811
OUR OVER OUR OVER ARCHING GOALS

00:36:53.878 --> 00:36:55.580
TO HAVE A ROBUST CRISIS CARE

00:36:55.646 --> 00:36:58.416
SYSTEM. THAT WORKS FOR ALL

00:36:58.482 --> 00:37:00.484
CALIFORNIANS. ABOVE ALL THIS

00:37:00.551 --> 00:37:01.986
BLUEPRINT WILL BE COKE CO

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:03.120
CREATED WITH OUR KEY

00:37:03.187 --> 00:37:04.655
STAKEHOLDERS MANY OF THEM

00:37:04.722 --> 00:37:06.090
ALREADY BEEN THINKING ABOUT

00:37:06.157 --> 00:37:08.426
THIS. SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE LAST

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.761
YEAR AND PREPARING FOR THIS AND

00:37:10.828 --> 00:37:12.496
I THINK IT'S- IMPERATIVE THAT

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.498
THEY BE INVOLVED NOT ONLY ARE

00:37:14.565 --> 00:37:15.800
STAKEHOLDERS BUT REALLY OUR

00:37:15.866 --> 00:37:17.368
STATE AGENCIES ARE LOCAL

00:37:17.435 --> 00:37:19.770
JURISDICTIONS. AND OF COURSE

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.839
CONSUMERS CAREGIVERS AND FAMILY

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:23.040
MEMBERS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO

00:37:23.107 --> 00:37:25.142
HAVE. FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE

00:37:25.209 --> 00:37:28.646
IMPACTED BY A SYSTEM THAT EITHER

00:37:28.713 --> 00:37:29.447
WORKS OR DOESN'T WORK. AND WE

00:37:29.513 --> 00:37:31.549
NEED THEIR USER EXPERIENCE TO

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:32.750
HELP US MAKE SOMETHING THAT

00:37:32.817 --> 00:37:35.820
WORKS BETTER- IN THE LAST FEW

00:37:35.886 --> 00:37:37.521
MONTHS WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT OF

00:37:37.588 --> 00:37:39.156
INTERNAL INFORMATION GATHERING

00:37:39.223 --> 00:37:41.058
AND ARE REALLY EXCITED TO LAUNCH

00:37:41.125 --> 00:37:43.060

OF WE WERE ALSO ASKED BY THE

00:37:53.237 --> 00:37:55.272
COMMITTEE TO SAY A FEW WORDS

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:57.375
ABOUT THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT WAS

00:37:57.441 --> 00:37:58.275
MADE BY THE GOVERNOR ON

00:37:58.342 --> 00:38:01.846
THURSDAY. RELATED TO THE CARE

00:38:01.912 --> 00:38:03.848
COURT INITIATIVE FRAMEWORK.

00:38:03.914 --> 00:38:05.483
TODAY HE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME

00:38:05.549 --> 00:38:07.351
I' GOING TO REALLY GET SOME

AND TALK ABOUT THIS IN MORE

00:38:20.097 --> 00:38:22.233
DETAIL. SO THE COMMUNITY

EMPOWERMENT OR CARE COURT. IS A

00:38:26.103 --> 00:38:28.105
PROPOSED FRAMEWORK I THINK THE

00:38:28.172 --> 00:38:29.940
TERM FRAMEWORK IS INCREDIBLY.

00:38:30.007 --> 00:38:32.109
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSCORE. BECAUSE

00:38:32.176 --> 00:38:33.944
THE ADMINISTRATION DEEPLY WANTS

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:35.513
TO DEVELOP THIS FURTHER WITH THE

00:38:35.579 --> 00:38:37.615
EXPERTISE AND INSIGHTS OF OUR

00:38:37.682 --> 00:38:39.417

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:45.756
SPACE FOR SEVERAL SEVERAL YEARS-

00:38:45.823 --> 00:38:47.858
AGENCY WE ARE DEDICATED TO

00:38:47.925 --> 00:38:50.027
SIGNIFICANT ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS.

00:38:50.094 --> 00:38:52.463
IN THE COMING WEEKS TO BUILD OUT

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:54.365
THE FRAMEWORK INTO A SET OF

00:38:54.432 --> 00:38:56.200
POLICY SOLUTIONS MANY OF WHICH

00:38:56.267 --> 00:38:59.003
HAVE DELIBERATED ON. IN THIS.

00:38:59.070 --> 00:39:01.105
PARTICULAR BODY I KNOW YOU GUYS

00:39:01.172 --> 00:39:03.107
HAD A VERY LARGE HEARING IN THE

00:39:03.174 --> 00:39:05.076
IN THE LATE FALL AND EARLY

00:39:05.142 --> 00:39:07.244
WINTER. ON THIS VERY TOPIC IN

00:39:07.311 --> 00:39:09.780
REALLY DELVED INTO A LOT OF

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:12.483
SOLUTIONS THAT I THINK ARE ARE

00:39:12.550 --> 00:39:14.585
WARRANTED TO. LIFT UP AND TO

00:39:14.652 --> 00:39:15.186

PARODY AND SHIPPED. THIS IS

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:34.672
ABOUT GOING UPSTREAM TO DIVERT

EVEN AS WE ARE PLANNING OUT THE

01:40:01.562 --> 01:40:03.263
BENEFIT BECAUSE THERE. OF COURSE

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.299

TO START. WITH THE POSSIBLE WE

01:40:06.400 --> 01:40:08.202
ALSO NEED TO MAKE SURE THERE'S

01:40:08.268 --> 01:40:10.104
ROBUST A QUARTER ENGAGE THEN AND

01:40:10.170 --> 01:40:11.805
WE LEARN FROM. OUR COUNTY

01:40:11.872 --> 01:40:13.440
COLLEAGUES STANDING AS CORNY AS

01:40:13.507 --> 01:40:16.643

01:40:16.710 --> 01:40:18.545
DIVERSE COUNTIES IN OUR SYSTEM

AND WE NEED TO CREATE A BENEFIT

01:40:19.613 --> 01:40:24.451
THAT'S WORKABLE. ACROSS THE

01:40:24.518 --> 01:40:27.154
STATE. MY NEXT QUESTION CAN BE

01:40:27.221 --> 01:40:28.722
FOR JOE FRANKLIN C. HAD SPOKEN.

01:40:28.789 --> 01:40:31.592
COOPER AND COORDINATION. AND

01:40:31.658 --> 01:40:35.963
THAT HOW- IN YOUR- GRAPH YOU HAD

01:40:36.029 --> 01:40:38.065
THE MOBILE CRISIS RESPONSE HELP

01:40:38.132 --> 01:40:40.134
TO DETERMINE. WHETHER OR NOT

01:40:40.200 --> 01:40:42.202
IT'S CRISIS RECEIVING OR

01:40:42.269 --> 01:40:44.638
HOSPITAL THAT'S RECEIVING. AND

01:40:44.705 --> 01:40:45.806
HOPING YOU COULD PROVIDE A

01:40:45.873 --> 01:40:48.008
LITTLE MORE CLARITY ABOUT. WHO

01:40:48.075 --> 01:40:50.043
HELPS TO MAKE THOSE DECISIONS

01:40:50.110 --> 01:40:51.845
WHO YOU ENVISION WOULD BE ON

01:40:51.912 --> 01:40:54.381
THOSE TEAMS. SO WE CAN BEGIN TO

01:40:54.448 --> 01:40:57.584
UNDERSTAND- AND- WHAT THE SHAPE

01:40:57.651 --> 01:41:01.755
AND FEEL OF IT IS LIKE. SO FOR

01:41:01.822 --> 01:41:03.590
THE CIVILIAN MOBILE CRISIS TEAMS

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:05.526
I THINK WERE YOU KNOW IDEALLY

01:41:05.592 --> 01:41:07.795
LOOKING AT A TWO PERSON TEAM- AT

01:41:07.861 --> 01:41:09.563
LEAST ONE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CARE

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:11.799
PROFESSIONAL- CAPABLE OF

01:41:11.865 --> 01:41:13.734
ASSESSING AN INDIVIDUAL'S NEEDS

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:16.737
CONSISTENT WITH- CONSISTENT WITH

01:41:16.804 --> 01:41:19.306
THE- 85% MATCH HARPER LAW AND

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:20.507
WHAT IT SPELLED OUT THERE AND-

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:22.075
IDEALLY THE OTHER PERSON WOULD

01:41:22.142 --> 01:41:24.912
BE A PEER. SUPPORT SPECIALIST-

01:41:24.978 --> 01:41:27.448
AND YOU KNOW I THINK THE HOPE IS

01:41:27.514 --> 01:41:28.482
THAT MOST OF THE TIME THOSE

01:41:28.549 --> 01:41:30.217
TEAMS WOULD BE ABLE TO STABILIZE

01:41:30.284 --> 01:41:32.019
SOMEONE IN COMMUNITY WITH NO

01:41:32.085 --> 01:41:33.420
NEED TO ESCALATE TO A HIGHER

01:41:33.487 --> 01:41:35.055
LEVEL OF CARE AT ALL A LOT OF

01:41:35.122 --> 01:41:36.023
OTHER JURISDICTIONS WERE

01:41:36.089 --> 01:41:37.157
FAMILIAR WITH. I'VE SEEN RATES

01:41:37.224 --> 01:41:38.559
OF 70% OR HIGHER THAT THEY'RE

01:41:38.625 --> 01:41:39.526
ABLE TO STABILIZE SOMEONE IN

01:41:39.593 --> 01:41:41.261
COMMUNITY AND SAFETY PLAN WITH

01:41:41.328 --> 01:41:43.297
THEM AND COMMUNITY SO IF THIS IS

01:41:43.363 --> 01:41:45.199
SET UP RIGHT IDEALLY THIS KIND

01:41:45.265 --> 01:41:46.500
OF SERVICE REDUCES YOU KNOW

01:41:46.567 --> 01:41:47.601
HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE NEEDS FOR

01:41:47.668 --> 01:41:50.571
CRISIS FACILITIES CRISIS CARE-

01:41:50.637 --> 01:41:52.673
FROM THERE THOUGH. YOU KNOW I

01:41:52.739 --> 01:41:54.107
THINK THE HOPE IS THAT MOST OF

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:56.076
THE TIME IF SOMEONE DOES NEED A

01:41:56.143 --> 01:41:57.644
HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE YOU CAN GO

01:41:57.711 --> 01:41:59.980
TO A CRISIS RECEIVING FACILITY-

01:42:00.047 --> 01:42:00.781
LIKE AN L. A. COUNTY WE CALL

01:42:00.848 --> 01:42:02.115
THEM TO HEAR AUTHORS AND CARE

01:42:02.182 --> 01:42:03.517
CENTERS BUT THEY'RE REALLY.

01:42:03.584 --> 01:42:07.154
TWENTY FOUR HOUR. CRISIS

01:42:07.221 --> 01:42:08.856
RECEIVING FACILITIES- AND THAT

01:42:08.922 --> 01:42:09.656
YOU KNOW THEY'LL HAVE YOU KNOW

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:12.526
THE- IT'S KIND OF CHECKLIST

01:42:12.593 --> 01:42:14.094
CRITERIA OF YOU KNOW SIGNS TO

01:42:14.161 --> 01:42:16.430
LOOK FOR A MEDICAL EMERGENCY

01:42:16.497 --> 01:42:17.197
THAT WOULD REALLY NECESSITATE

01:42:17.264 --> 01:42:18.298
GOING TO EMERGENCY ROOM AT THAT

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.733
POINT. I THINK THEY'RE IDEALLY

01:42:19.800 --> 01:42:21.201
CALLING NINE ONE ONE IN GETTING

01:42:21.268 --> 01:42:23.437
EMS INVOLVED SO I THINK THE HOPE

01:42:23.504 --> 01:42:25.739
IS MOST OF THE TIME YOU KNOW

01:42:25.806 --> 01:42:26.540
UNLESS THERE'S A CLEAR SIGN A

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:28.342
MEDICAL EMERGENCY THAT SHOULD DO

01:42:28.408 --> 01:42:30.177
WE WANT THEM TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

01:42:30.244 --> 01:42:31.545
SOMEONE TO A PROPER CRISIS

01:42:31.612 --> 01:42:32.679
RECEIVING FACILITY IF THEY NEED

01:42:32.746 --> 01:42:34.448
A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE. MAYBE

01:42:34.515 --> 01:42:35.949

HEALTH COMMUNITY BEHAVIOR HEALTH

02:12:43.755 --> 02:12:46.191
STRATEGIES- THAT TIES IN VERY

02:12:46.258 --> 02:12:47.793
NICELY WITH THE NINE EIGHT

02:12:47.859 --> 02:12:49.828
DISCUSSION EARLIER TODAY- THAT

02:12:49.895 --> 02:12:52.164
CRISIS NOW WORK WAS IN RESPONSE

02:12:52.230 --> 02:12:54.399
TO. YELLOW COUNTY THAT WAS

02:12:54.466 --> 02:12:55.500
INTERESTED IN THAT MODEL AND

02:12:55.567 --> 02:12:57.502
WHAT AND OUR OUR DIRECTION THE

02:12:57.569 --> 02:12:59.104
OTHER COUNTY WESTERN BRING IN

02:12:59.171 --> 02:13:00.839
OTHER COUNTIES IF THEY WERE

02:13:00.906 --> 02:13:01.673
INTERESTED. BECAUSE THAT WAS ONE

02:13:01.740 --> 02:13:03.809
OF OUR CRITERIA IS THAT WE WOULD

02:13:03.875 --> 02:13:05.510
NOT FIND A COUNTY PROJECT THAT

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:07.312
WE WOULD FIND MULTIPLE COUNTIES

02:13:07.379 --> 02:13:09.047
COMING TOGETHER TO LEARN FROM

02:13:09.114 --> 02:13:11.583
EACH OTHER. FOR ME TO LEARN FROM

02:13:11.650 --> 02:13:12.417
EACH OTHER AND LEVERAGE THEIR

02:13:12.484 --> 02:13:13.885
DOLLARS TO STRENGTHEN THESE

02:13:13.952 --> 02:13:14.619
PREVENTION OR INTERVENTION

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:17.122

MENTION AND- DEPUTY SECRETARY

02:13:19.925 --> 02:13:21.460
WELCH'S COMMENTS EARLIER ABOUT

02:13:21.526 --> 02:13:23.795
TAKE ADVANCE DIRECTIVES. WE HAVE

02:13:23.862 --> 02:13:25.030
FIVE COUNTIES THAT ARE EXPLORING

02:13:25.097 --> 02:13:26.665
HOW WE COULD BEST LEVERAGE

02:13:26.732 --> 02:13:28.867
PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVES

02:13:28.934 --> 02:13:30.669
TO AGAIN REDUCE RELIANCE ON

02:13:30.736 --> 02:13:32.571
ONLINE PORTION BUT IDEALLY.

02:13:32.637 --> 02:13:34.806
REDUCE THE DURATION OF A CRISIS

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:37.142
BECAUSE WE SAT DOWN WITH A

02:13:37.209 --> 02:13:38.343
MENTAL HEALTH CARE IN ADVANCE TO

02:13:38.410 --> 02:13:40.979
TALK ABOUT. HOW WE SHOULD BE

02:13:41.046 --> 02:13:42.214
RESPONDING WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL

02:13:42.280 --> 02:13:46.184
EXPERIENCES A CRISIS. THAT THE

02:13:46.251 --> 02:13:47.486
PSYCHIATRIC ADVANCE DIRECTIVE

02:13:47.552 --> 02:13:48.520
BECOME IS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL

02:13:48.587 --> 02:13:50.322
DURING A POINT WHEN THEY'RE NOT

02:13:50.389 --> 02:13:51.623
IN CRISIS LAYS OUT A GAME PLAN

02:13:51.690 --> 02:13:53.892
FOR HOW BEST TO RESPOND TO THEIR

02:13:53.959 --> 02:13:55.160
NEEDS WHEN THEY ARE IN CRISIS.

02:13:55.227 --> 02:13:56.628
THIS STRATEGY IS ALL PART OF AN

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:59.097
EFFORT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE HAVE

02:13:59.164 --> 02:14:02.100
A CONTINUE OF SERVICES AND QUITE

02:14:02.167 --> 02:14:04.102
OFTEN THE STATE HOSPITALS AT THE

02:14:04.169 --> 02:14:05.637
IS IT THE DEEP IN THE FINAL

02:14:05.704 --> 02:14:08.407
STEP. OF THAT SYSTEM. AND WE

02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:09.708
NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT EACH

02:14:09.775 --> 02:14:11.510
OF THE STEPS PRIOR TO STATE

02:14:11.576 --> 02:14:13.044
HOSPITAL INVOLVEMENT AND HOW WE

02:14:13.111 --> 02:14:14.646
CAN FORTIFY THAT STRATEGY. SO

02:14:14.713 --> 02:14:17.883
VERY QUICKLY THE- BCP IN FRONT

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:19.384

PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED

02:14:26.658 --> 02:14:28.460
TO KEEP PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS

02:14:28.527 --> 02:14:30.162
OUT OF THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:14:30.228 --> 02:14:32.097
SYSTEM. AND OUT OF HOSPITALS-

02:14:32.164 --> 02:14:36.301
SOME- FIFTEEN YEARS AGO AND SO

02:14:36.368 --> 02:14:37.235
TRY TO THINK ABOUT HOW LONG AGO

02:14:37.302 --> 02:14:39.671
THAT WAS. SO WE RECOGNIZE THAT

02:14:39.738 --> 02:14:41.406
IF WE HAVE A ROBUST AND WELL

02:14:41.473 --> 02:14:43.942

SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT THAT

02:14:47.312 --> 02:14:49.114
SHOULD MEAN THE NUMBERS OF FOLKS

02:14:49.181 --> 02:14:50.415
WHO ARE JUSTICE INVOLVED GOES

02:14:50.482 --> 02:14:52.551
DOWN AND THAT SHOULD MEAN THE

02:14:52.617 --> 02:14:54.219
NUMBER OF FOLKS WHO ARE LANDING

02:14:54.286 --> 02:14:56.354
IN STATE HOSPITAL SHOULD GO DOWN

02:14:56.421 --> 02:14:58.123
. UPSTREAM FROM THAT IS OUR WORK

02:14:58.190 --> 02:14:59.458
ON EARLY PSYCHOSIS RECOGNIZING

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:01.927

LIFELONG DISABLING CONDITION BUT

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:22.447
A CONDITION THAT CAN BE MANAGED

02:16:31.316 --> 02:16:32.450
WOULD NOTE THAT WE FIND THE

02:16:32.517 --> 02:16:34.219
APPROACH TO FOCUS RESOURCES ON

02:16:34.286 --> 02:16:36.121

BRIDGE HOUSING WHICH IS NOT

02:16:51.603 --> 02:16:53.538
NECESSARILY A FOCUS OF MUCH OF

02:16:53.605 --> 02:16:55.373
THE STATE'S PRIOR SPENDING ON

02:16:55.440 --> 02:16:56.575

RELATED TO HOW THIS PROPOSAL

02:17:05.684 --> 02:17:08.019
WOULD WORK IN PRACTICE- SUCH AS

02:17:08.086 --> 02:17:09.321
SORT OF HOW THE FUNDS WOULD

02:17:09.387 --> 02:17:11.590
ULTIMATELY BE DISTRIBUTED- IN

02:17:11.656 --> 02:17:13.158
ADDITION YOU WE UNDERSTAND THAT

02:17:13.224 --> 02:17:14.392
THE ADMINISTRATION IS NOT

02:17:14.459 --> 02:17:15.860
PLANNING TO HAVE TRAILER BILL

02:17:15.927 --> 02:17:18.029
FOR THIS PROPOSAL- THESE TWO

02:17:18.096 --> 02:17:19.764
FACTORS TOGETHER MAY LIMIT THE

02:17:19.831 --> 02:17:21.032
AMOUNT OF. INPUT THAT THE

OPPORTUNITIES FOR OVERSIGHT-

02:17:32.010 --> 02:17:33.345
THIS TRAILER BILL COULD SPECIFY

02:17:33.411 --> 02:17:35.246
KEEP PROGRAM DETAILS SUCH AS FOR

DISTRIBUTED TO COUNTIES QUICKER-

02:17:47.926 --> 02:17:49.527
IT COULD ALSO SPECIFY YOU KNOW

HOW FUNDING WOULD BE PRIORITIZE

02:17:51.596 --> 02:17:52.464
FOR DIFFERENT REGIONS OF THE

02:17:52.530 --> 02:17:54.799
STATE- WHAT SHARE OF THOSE FUNDS

02:17:54.866 --> 02:17:56.067
SHOULD GO TOWARD THE

02:17:56.134 --> 02:17:57.569
CONSTRUCTION OF TINY HOMES

02:17:57.636 --> 02:17:59.571
WHICH- ARE RELATIVELY NEW

02:17:59.638 --> 02:18:02.340
CONCEPT FOR STATE- HOMELESSNESS

02:18:02.407 --> 02:18:03.675
RELIEF WHICH COME WITH TRADE

02:18:03.742 --> 02:18:06.044

WOULD REPRESENT A NEW STATE

02:18:23.662 --> 02:18:24.663
APPROACH SUCH AS THE

02:18:24.729 --> 02:18:28.967
CONSTRUCTION OF TINY HOMES- WE

02:18:29.034 --> 02:18:29.501
WOULD RECOMMEND PROVIDING.

02:18:29.567 --> 02:18:30.301
PLANNING FUNDS- WHAT'S THE

02:18:30.368 --> 02:18:31.870
PROVIDING FOR TRADITIONAL

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.171
APPROACHES SUCH AS SECURING

HOUSING IN EXISTING ASSISTED

02:18:35.073 --> 02:18:38.076
LIVING SETTINGS- NEXT WE JUST

02:18:38.143 --> 02:18:39.344
KNOW THAT IT'S UNCLEAR WHAT

02:18:39.411 --> 02:18:40.378
WOULD HAPPEN TO THESE BRIDGE

02:18:40.445 --> 02:18:41.813
HOUSING UNITS PARTICULARLY THE

02:18:41.880 --> 02:18:44.182
TINY HOMES. AFTER THE LIMITED

02:18:44.249 --> 02:18:45.784
TERM FUNDING FOR THIS PROPOSAL

02:18:45.850 --> 02:18:47.952
IS EXHAUSTED. EVEN AFTER THE

02:18:48.019 --> 02:18:50.055
LONGER TERM UNITS FUNDED BY A

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:51.556
PRIOR STATE INVESTMENTS COME

02:18:51.623 --> 02:18:53.825
ONLINE. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.727
THERE WILL STILL NEED THERE WILL

02:18:55.794 --> 02:18:56.961
THERE WILL STILL BE SOME NEED

02:18:57.028 --> 02:18:59.431
FOR- BRIDGE HOUSING OPTIONS IN

02:18:59.497 --> 02:19:01.099
THE COMMUNITY. AND IF COUNTIES

02:19:01.166 --> 02:19:03.201
WANT TO SORT OF. CONTINUE

02:19:03.268 --> 02:19:04.602
OPERATING THESE BRIDGE HOUSING

02:19:04.669 --> 02:19:05.570
FACILITIES AFTER THE FUNDING

02:19:05.637 --> 02:19:07.238
RUNS OUT- THEY WOULD NEED TO

02:19:07.305 --> 02:19:09.374
COME UP WITH THEIR OWN THEY

02:19:09.441 --> 02:19:10.175
WOULD NEED TO SORT OF USE

02:19:10.241 --> 02:19:11.543
ALTERNATIVE FUNDING SOURCES TO

02:19:11.609 --> 02:19:14.012
DO SO- AND THEIR CAPACITY TO DO

02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:16.347
SO IS ULTIMATELY UNCLEAR-

02:19:16.414 --> 02:19:18.083
FINALLY THE LEGISLATURE MAY WISH

02:19:18.149 --> 02:19:19.484
TO CONSIDER THE TRADE OFFS

02:19:19.551 --> 02:19:21.119
BETWEEN THIS PROPOSAL. WHICH

02:19:21.186 --> 02:19:22.754
PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE

BEHAVIOR HEALTH CONTINUUM

02:19:23.655 --> 02:19:25.423
INFRASTRUCTURE PROGRAM AND

02:19:25.490 --> 02:19:26.691
POTENTIALLY MODIFYING OR

02:19:26.758 --> 02:19:28.493
EXPANDING EXISTING STATE

02:19:28.560 --> 02:19:29.928
HOMELESSNESS PROGRAMS TO FOCUS

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:32.163
SPECIFICALLY ON INDIVIDUALS

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:32.931
STRUGGLING WITH BEHAVIORAL

02:19:32.997 --> 02:19:34.933
HEALTH NEEDS- WE RAISE THIS

02:19:34.999 --> 02:19:36.401
TRADE OFF IS A CONSIDERATION

02:19:36.468 --> 02:19:38.203
BECAUSE THOSE EXISTING PROGRAMS

02:19:38.269 --> 02:19:39.971
MAY HAVE GREATER CAPACITY TO

02:19:40.038 --> 02:19:42.373
DEPLOY BRIDGE HOUSING QUICKLY-

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:43.274
BECAUSE THEY HAVE A TRACK RECORD

02:19:43.341 --> 02:19:44.743
OF MAKING HOUSING. AVAILABLE

02:19:44.809 --> 02:19:45.710
IMMEDIATELY FOR PEOPLE

EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND IT

02:19:47.846 --> 02:19:49.748
MAY TAKE SOME TIME FOR DH CS TO

02:19:49.814 --> 02:19:51.216
ULTIMATELY DISBURSED THESE

02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:54.352

BUT NOT ALL OF THEM- WE

02:20:41.399 --> 02:20:43.034
GENERALLY FIND THESE REASONABLE

02:20:43.101 --> 02:20:45.370
PRIORITIES TO FIND THIS YEAR FOR

02:20:45.436 --> 02:20:47.338
EXAMPLE THE EARLY STABILIZATION

02:20:47.405 --> 02:20:49.240
INVESTMENTS IN PROMISING GIVEN

02:20:49.307 --> 02:20:51.176
THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT LACK OF

02:20:51.242 --> 02:20:52.644
EARLY STABILIZATION IS ONE OF

02:20:52.710 --> 02:20:55.046
THE MAJOR BARRIERS TO ENSURING

02:20:55.113 --> 02:20:56.581
THAT AN INDIVIDUAL CAN

02:20:56.648 --> 02:20:58.216
PARTICIPATE IN COMMUNITY OPTIONS

WORKGROUP REPORT INCLUDED A

02:21:04.589 --> 02:21:06.858
VARIETY OF IDEAS- INCLUDING SOME

UNDERLYING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES

02:21:10.228 --> 02:21:11.496
THAT MAY LEAD SOMEONE TO BE

02:21:11.563 --> 02:21:13.698
FOUND I S. T. IN THE FIRST

02:21:13.765 --> 02:21:14.866
PLACE- SUCH AS THROUGH INCREASED

02:21:14.933 --> 02:21:16.568
COORDINATION WITH OTHER STATE

02:21:16.634 --> 02:21:18.636
AND LOCAL ENTITIES. ALTHOUGH

02:21:18.703 --> 02:21:20.038
SOME OF THESE IDEAS ARE VERY

02:21:20.104 --> 02:21:21.539
CONCEPTUAL AT THIS POINT THE

02:21:21.606 --> 02:21:23.775
LEGISLATURE WE WISH TO MONITOR

02:21:23.842 --> 02:21:25.810
PROGRESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF-

02:21:25.877 --> 02:21:27.212

REFERRALS FROM COUNTIES. WE FIND

02:21:35.687 --> 02:21:37.722
THAT A CAP MAY MAKE SENSE TO

02:21:37.789 --> 02:21:39.190
INCENTIVIZE COUNTIES TO PARTNER

02:21:39.257 --> 02:21:41.226
WITH THE S. H. ON THESE

02:21:41.292 --> 02:21:42.026

02:21:42.093 --> 02:21:44.062
COUNTY CAPACITY TO REMAIN UNDER

02:21:44.128 --> 02:21:46.464
THESE CAPS IS UNCLEAR-

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:47.799
FURTHERMORE WHILE THE

STATE CONSTITUTION GENERALLY

02:21:55.340 --> 02:21:56.875
REQUIRES THE STATE TO REIMBURSE

THAT ELENI I S. T. TREATMENT IS

02:22:03.181 --> 02:22:05.516
A STATE RESPONSIBILITY- WE FIND

02:22:05.583 --> 02:22:06.751
THAT THE PROPOSED CAP RAISES

02:22:06.818 --> 02:22:08.052
QUESTIONS OF WHETHER THIS WOULD

02:22:08.119 --> 02:22:09.587
BE CONSIDERED A STATE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH A COURT

02:22:24.469 --> 02:22:26.504

COURT MANDATE REASONS- WE WOULD

02:22:42.153 --> 02:22:43.588
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

STATE'S APPROACH TO THIS PROBLEM

02:27:16.527 --> 02:27:18.529
IS A VERY WELCOME CHANGE OF

02:27:18.596 --> 02:27:21.332
DIRECTION FOR DECADES THE STATUS

REALIZE YOU CANNOT BUILD ITS WAY

02:27:30.374 --> 02:27:32.310
OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND IS

02:27:32.376 --> 02:27:34.879
EMPHASIZING OR PRICKLY DIVERSION

02:27:34.946 --> 02:27:38.649
AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAMS

02:27:38.716 --> 02:27:39.483
THAT'S A FANTASTIC DEVELOPMENTS

02:27:39.550 --> 02:27:40.952
. THE BASE TREATMENT IS MUCH

02:27:41.018 --> 02:27:42.520
MORE EFFECTIVE FOR THE

02:27:42.587 --> 02:27:43.287
INDIVIDUALS MUCH BETTER

02:27:43.354 --> 02:27:44.522
MANAGEMENT TOOLS AND MUCH MORE

02:27:44.589 --> 02:27:46.657
COST EFFECTIVE A BAD MISTAKE

02:27:46.724 --> 02:27:48.326
HOSPITAL CAN COST HUNDREDS OF

02:27:48.392 --> 02:27:50.595
THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS A YEAR.

02:27:50.661 --> 02:27:52.029
EIGHT COMMUNITY TREATMENT AND

02:27:52.096 --> 02:27:53.397
WHAT'S HOUSING COSTS A MERE

02:27:53.464 --> 02:27:56.133
FRACTION OF THAT. SO THE OVERALL

02:27:56.200 --> 02:27:57.635
APPROACH HIS EXCELLENCY MIDLEVEL

02:27:57.702 --> 02:27:59.770
OF COURSE IN THE DETAILS AND

02:27:59.837 --> 02:28:01.973
THERE ARE A COUPLE- SIGNIFICANT

02:28:02.039 --> 02:28:03.708
ISSUES OR PROBLEMS WITH THE

02:28:03.774 --> 02:28:07.011
CURRENT PROPOSAL IN THAT TRAILER

02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:09.347
BILL. THE FIRST ONE IS ONE OF

02:28:09.413 --> 02:28:11.549
MS. PETERSON'S MENTIONED IN THAT

02:28:11.616 --> 02:28:13.351
IT WOULD AMEND THE DIVERGENT

02:28:13.417 --> 02:28:15.586
VALUES TO NARROW YOUR GOALIE FOR

02:28:15.653 --> 02:28:17.154
DIVERSION AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY

02:28:17.221 --> 02:28:18.556
THE WRONG DIRECTION TO BE GOING

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:20.491
WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING THE

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:21.993
VERSION NOT LIMITING IT. SO

02:28:22.059 --> 02:28:24.996
CURRENTLY AND I IS TO DO A BROAD

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:26.697
DEFENDER CAN BE DIVERTED YES I

02:28:26.764 --> 02:28:28.933
HEAR SHE IS FOUND R. S. T. OR IF

02:28:29.000 --> 02:28:30.468
FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE PERSON

02:28:30.534 --> 02:28:32.036
AND- THAT PERSON IS LIKELY TO

02:28:32.103 --> 02:28:33.971
BECOME MYERS T. WHAT THAT MEANS

02:28:34.038 --> 02:28:35.473
YOU CAN DIVERT SOMEBODY EARLY IN

02:28:35.539 --> 02:28:36.807
THE PROCESS WITHOUT WAITING

02:28:36.874 --> 02:28:38.442
MONTHS FOR THE EVALUATION OF THE

02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:40.578
COURT HEARING. YOU ACTUALLY FIND

02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:43.681
THE PERSON I S. T. E. R. THE

02:28:43.748 --> 02:28:46.751
PROPOSED AMENDMENT WOULD CHANGE.

02:28:46.817 --> 02:28:48.319
AND THAT'S THAT'S A BAD IDEA

02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:49.553
FIRST OF ALL BECAUSE IT WOULD

02:28:49.620 --> 02:28:50.421
MEAN THAT PEOPLE WHO WERE

02:28:50.488 --> 02:28:52.056
DEPORTED AFTER WAIT MONTHS OFF

02:28:52.123 --> 02:28:53.724
IN JAIL OFTEN SOLITARY

02:28:53.791 --> 02:28:55.259
CONFINEMENT WITH NO TREATMENT

02:28:55.326 --> 02:28:56.927
BEFORE THEY CAN BE DEPARTMENT.

02:28:56.994 --> 02:28:58.596
THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR ANYBODY AND

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:00.531
ALSO IT WOULD NARROW ELIGIBILITY

02:29:00.598 --> 02:29:01.966
PEOPLE WHO ARE WE'RE NOT

02:29:02.033 --> 02:29:03.367
INVESTMENT ADVICE YOU WOULDN'T

02:29:03.434 --> 02:29:10.041
BE DIVERTED- WHICH- IS A PROBLEM

02:29:10.107 --> 02:29:11.208
BECAUSE- THE STATE IS ALL. NOT

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:13.577
USING. ITS TO ENTICE THE STATE I

02:29:13.644 --> 02:29:15.079
MEAN. LOCAL COURT TO ARE NOT

02:29:15.146 --> 02:29:17.214
USING THE EXISTING DIVERSION

02:29:17.281 --> 02:29:19.383
CAPACITY AS MCCARTY EARLIER THAN

02:29:19.450 --> 02:29:20.885
SAY A PROGRAM THAT HAS EIGHT

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:22.186
HUNDRED TWENTY BEDS. ARE

02:29:22.253 --> 02:29:25.323
PROJECTS OF WHICH ONLY FOUR

02:29:25.389 --> 02:29:26.724
HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT AND ACTUALLY

02:29:26.791 --> 02:29:28.125
BEEN USED WE HAVE ACCESS TO

02:29:28.192 --> 02:29:29.794
PASSAGE OF PERVERSION WE CAN USE

02:29:29.860 --> 02:29:31.662
THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE DO NOT-

02:29:31.729 --> 02:29:32.563
NARROWING ELIGIBILITY FOR

02:29:32.630 --> 02:29:35.099
DIVERSE- WHICH IS GOING TO LEAD

02:29:35.166 --> 02:29:37.001
TO EVEN MORE EXCESS CAPACITY.

02:29:37.068 --> 02:29:39.704
THAT'S A BAD IDEA. THE SECOND

02:29:39.770 --> 02:29:43.641
ISSUE. IS THAT. THE STATUTE

02:29:43.708 --> 02:29:45.509
AMERICANS ELEVEN SEVENTY AGE

02:29:45.576 --> 02:29:46.877
QUITE APPROPRIATELY TO TRIED

02:29:46.944 --> 02:29:49.480
YOU. ARE INCENTIVIZE OR PROMOTE

02:29:49.547 --> 02:29:50.481
DIVERSION A COMMUNITY BASED

02:29:50.548 --> 02:29:52.283
TREATMENT. HOWEVER IT DOESN'T GO

02:29:52.350 --> 02:29:55.252
FAR ENOUGH TO. OVERCOME YEARS

02:29:55.319 --> 02:30:00.691
AND YEARS OF. HABIT OF SENDING

02:30:00.758 --> 02:30:02.493
PEOPLE TO LOCK. THE PROPOSAL

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:04.228
WITH THAT IF THE COURT IS ITS

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:05.663
OUT FOR OF BASED. MEANING THAT

02:30:05.730 --> 02:30:07.798
CLINICALLY APPROPRIATE. AND IT'S

02:30:07.865 --> 02:30:09.333
APPROPRIATE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY

02:30:09.400 --> 02:30:11.302
STANDPOINT AND THERE'S NO DOUBLE

02:30:11.369 --> 02:30:14.705
BED. THE COURT SHALL FIRST

02:30:14.772 --> 02:30:16.073
CONSIDER SPENDING THE PERSON.

02:30:16.140 --> 02:30:17.808
WELL THAT'S THAT'S NOT STRONG

02:30:17.875 --> 02:30:18.809
ENOUGH TO OVERCOME THIS YEAR'S

02:30:18.876 --> 02:30:21.645
OF- AS I SAID NURTURING

02:30:21.712 --> 02:30:22.680
TRADITION WE NEED A PARADIGM

02:30:22.747 --> 02:30:24.682
SHIFT. THE STATURE CAN SIMPLY

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:26.317
SAY THAT IF SOMEBODY'S ELIGIBLE

02:30:26.384 --> 02:30:27.885
FOR DIVERSION OF TREATMENT

02:30:27.952 --> 02:30:29.520
EFFECTS ARE CLINICALLY

02:30:29.587 --> 02:30:31.756
APPROPRIATE AND APPROPRIATE

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:32.556
TERMS OF PUBLIC SAFETY AND

02:30:32.623 --> 02:30:34.225
THERE'S AN OPENING. THEY SHOULD

02:30:34.291 --> 02:30:35.926
BE SENT TO THAT'S LOST IN MASS

02:30:35.993 --> 02:30:37.395
THERE ARE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES

02:30:37.461 --> 02:30:39.296
THAT THE MILITANT OTHERWISE

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:40.197
OTHERWISE WE'RE SIMPLY GONNA

02:30:40.264 --> 02:30:43.367
HAVE UNUSED CAPACITY WHICH

02:30:43.434 --> 02:30:44.435
DOESN'T DO ANYBODY ANY GOOD.

02:30:44.502 --> 02:30:45.770
REPLACEMENTS AND- WE'VE HEARD

02:30:45.836 --> 02:30:48.472
ABOUT A PROPOSED CAP ON OUR

CRITICIZED BY THOSE WHO MENTION

02:30:51.142 --> 02:30:53.511
AND RIGHTLY SO WE DON'T NEED TO

02:30:53.577 --> 02:30:56.814
CAP. THE OUR STATE ITSELF AS WE

02:30:56.881 --> 02:30:58.182

PARTURITION SHE PASSED AWAY. HE

02:34:32.062 --> 02:34:33.697
DIDN'T EVEN GET THE CHANCE TO

02:34:33.764 --> 02:34:36.533
SAY GOODBYE TO HIS MOTHER. WHEN

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:38.435
JOHN WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY HE

02:34:38.502 --> 02:34:40.871

HOSPITAL BUT IT SHOULD NEVER

02:34:52.149 --> 02:34:54.852
HAVE TO BEST AND IT SHOULDN'T

02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:57.221
HAVE TAKEN THIS LONG. I STILL

02:34:57.287 --> 02:34:59.957
DON'T KNOW WHAT COMES NEXT AND

02:35:00.024 --> 02:35:03.027
NEITHER DOES HE- HE DOES CALL ME

02:35:03.093 --> 02:35:06.096
HE ASKED. HEY WHAT'S GOING TO

02:35:06.163 --> 02:35:08.332
HAPPEN TO ALL. IT MAKES NO SENSE

02:35:08.399 --> 02:35:10.134
TO ME THAT HE STILL HAS FELONY

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:12.936
CHARGES PENDING FOR ONCE AGAIN A

02:35:13.003 --> 02:35:16.140
NON VIOLENT OF THAT. WHICH IS

02:35:16.206 --> 02:35:17.808
CLEARLY RELATED TO HIS MENTAL

02:35:17.875 --> 02:35:20.477
ILLNESS ISN'T THAT WHY WE HAVE

02:35:20.544 --> 02:35:22.646
MENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION PROGRAMS

02:35:22.713 --> 02:35:24.515
SHOULDN'T HE BE A CANDIDATE FOR

02:35:24.581 --> 02:35:26.483
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT RATHER

02:35:26.550 --> 02:35:28.419
THAN GET A CRIMINAL RECORD AND

02:35:28.485 --> 02:35:30.921
BE AND LOCK UP. I BELIEVE THAT

02:35:30.988 --> 02:35:33.791
IF MY COUSIN HAD BEEN TRACED TO

02:35:33.857 --> 02:35:34.758
THE COMMUNITY TREATMENT. HE

02:35:34.825 --> 02:35:36.360
WOULD HAVE RESPONDED TO THAT

02:35:36.427 --> 02:35:38.462
TREATMENT HE WILLINGLY TAKES HIS

02:35:38.529 --> 02:35:40.698
MEDICATIONS NOTHING IS BEING

02:35:40.764 --> 02:35:45.202
FORCED ON HIM. AT THE TIME THAT

02:35:45.269 --> 02:35:47.104
HE WAS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY WE

02:35:47.171 --> 02:35:48.872
WILL MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO FIND

02:35:48.939 --> 02:35:50.474
MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTIVE

02:35:50.541 --> 02:35:52.843
SERVICES FOR HIM BUT BECAUSE OF

02:35:52.910 --> 02:35:54.344
HOPE THAT THE SERVICES WERE

02:35:54.411 --> 02:35:57.548
LACKING THEY WERE NON EXISTENT.

02:35:57.614 --> 02:35:59.516
I WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM COME

HOME AT RECLAIM IS LIVE. I

02:36:01.552 --> 02:36:03.320
BELIEVE THAT HE CAN BENEFIT FROM

A ENTAL HEALTH DIVERSION

02:36:04.688 --> 02:36:08.225
PROGRAM THIS WOULD ALLOW HIM TO

02:36:08.292 --> 02:36:10.694
BE CLOSE TO HOME. HERE HE NEEDS

02:36:12.730 --> 02:36:14.598

02:58:18.454 --> 02:58:20.656
BEGIN WITH- DIRECTOR CLINTON AND

02:58:20.723 --> 02:58:23.225
IF I CAN. I'M TRYING TO. JUST

02:58:23.292 --> 02:58:25.961
UNDERSTAND THE SYSTEM AND SO I'D

02:58:26.028 --> 02:58:30.299
LIKE TO UNDERSTAND THE INPUT.

02:58:30.366 --> 02:58:32.001
MIGHT- SO WHY HAPPENS WHEN A

02:58:32.068 --> 02:58:34.236
PUBLIC DEFENDER OR ANOTHER

02:58:34.303 --> 02:58:35.871
DEFENSE ATTORNEY BELIEVES THAT

02:58:35.938 --> 02:58:37.940
THEIR CLIENT MAY BE INCOMPETENT

02:58:38.007 --> 02:58:40.342

PERFORMS THAT COMPETENCY

02:58:41.944 --> 02:58:44.613
EVALUATION. WHAT ARE THEIR

02:58:44.680 --> 02:58:47.516
CREDENTIALS AND HOW DO WE ENSURE

02:58:47.583 --> 02:58:48.851
THE COMPETENCY OF THESE

02:58:48.918 --> 02:58:56.592
PROFESSIONALS. WHAT HAPPENS WHEN

02:58:56.659 --> 02:59:00.396
AN INDIVIDUAL- IS ARRESTED ON

02:59:00.463 --> 02:59:02.832
AND IS- SUSPECTED OF BEING

02:59:02.898 --> 02:59:04.900
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IS

02:59:04.967 --> 02:59:07.236
THAT AND SOMEONE WHO WOULD RAISE

02:59:07.303 --> 02:59:08.170
THE DOUBT THAT DOESN'T

02:59:08.237 --> 02:59:10.172
NECESSARILY HAVE TO BE JUST A

02:59:10.239 --> 02:59:12.374
PUBLIC DEFENDER BUT- THE AT THE

02:59:12.441 --> 02:59:14.310
TECH HAPPENED THAT DOT WOULD BE

02:59:14.376 --> 02:59:16.412
REYES AND THEN THE COURT WOULD

02:59:16.479 --> 02:59:18.447
APPOINT A COURT APPOINTED AND-

02:59:18.514 --> 02:59:20.249

INDIVIDUALS COMPETENCY STATUS-

02:59:28.491 --> 02:59:30.159

DOT COMPETENCY REPORT IS

02:59:31.994 --> 02:59:34.663
COMPLETED AND SUBMITTED BACK TO

02:59:34.730 --> 02:59:38.334
THE COURT- BE. SEVERAL YEARS

STATUE NUMBER OFF THE TOP OF MY

02:59:42.438 --> 02:59:44.874
HEAD BUT THERE WAS STATUTES THAT

02:59:44.940 --> 02:59:47.176

02:59:50.713 --> 02:59:53.015
STANDARDS. FOR COURT APPOINTED

02:59:53.082 --> 02:59:55.751

REGULATIONS AROUND THOSE COURT

02:59:57.887 --> 03:00:00.689

03:00:09.765 --> 03:00:12.635
SITUATION WHERE COURT IS UNABLE

03:00:12.701 --> 03:00:15.704
TO- I FIND SOMEONE TO MEET THOSE

03:00:15.771 --> 03:00:17.606
NEEDS TO STILL BE ABLE TO

THANK YOU YEAH AS IT RELATES- AT

THE COUNTIES AND SO THAT WOULD

03:04:45.441 --> 03:04:47.009
BE A DIFFERENT PATHWAY IS

03:04:47.075 --> 03:04:48.811

COUNTY IS TO PERFORM THESE

03:05:14.403 --> 03:05:16.839
SERVICES SO THE OTHER COUNTIES

03:05:16.905 --> 03:05:17.306

IS IT THAT- AS WAS STATED THERE

03:05:29.818 --> 03:05:31.420

DIRECTOR WHO'S MAKING THAT

03:05:38.060 --> 03:05:40.496
DETERMINATION OR IS IT CAPACITY

03:05:40.562 --> 03:05:42.531
CONSTRAINTS THAT WE CURRENTLY

REASON THAT WE HAVE THESE

03:05:56.745 --> 03:05:58.947

I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND ARE THESE

03:06:04.753 --> 03:06:09.625
CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS. BEDS. OR

03:06:09.691 --> 03:06:13.295
STAFF OR BOTH. EIGHT I WILL TAKE

03:06:13.362 --> 03:06:15.097
THAT QUESTION IN SO REALLY WE

03:06:15.163 --> 03:06:17.566
HAVE IT- IS. A LITTLE BIT OF

03:06:17.633 --> 03:06:19.701
BOTH SO THE FIRST IS BEING IN

03:06:19.768 --> 03:06:21.270
THE REFERRALS HAVE BEEN

03:06:21.336 --> 03:06:23.171
INCREASING SO THE REFERRALS FROM

03:06:23.238 --> 03:06:24.506
THE COURT THIS WOULD BE IN THE

03:06:24.573 --> 03:06:26.241
REFERRALS THAT ARE COMING FROM

03:06:26.308 --> 03:06:27.609
THE SUPERIOR COURT. THEY DEEM

03:06:27.676 --> 03:06:28.710
SOMEBODY INCOMPETENT TO STAND

03:06:28.777 --> 03:06:30.646
TRIAL THAT BECOME AN INDIVIDUAL

03:06:30.712 --> 03:06:31.747
WHO IS INCOMPETENT TO STAND

03:06:31.813 --> 03:06:33.115
TRIAL AS CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR

03:06:33.181 --> 03:06:35.083
EVENS POINTED OUT- HE WAS

03:06:35.150 --> 03:06:38.353
CHARGED ON FELONY CHARGES. IS

03:06:38.420 --> 03:06:40.222
THAT COMMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT

03:06:40.289 --> 03:06:41.890
AND SO THE NUMBER OF REFERRALS

03:06:41.957 --> 03:06:43.258
COMING FROM OUR COURTS HAS

03:06:43.325 --> 03:06:45.861
CONTINUED TO INCREASE WE HAVE

03:06:45.928 --> 03:06:47.529
RESPONDED WITH A LOT OF CAPACITY

03:06:47.596 --> 03:06:50.365
INCREASES BUT- BASED ON THE

03:06:50.432 --> 03:06:52.267
LEVEL OF CAPACITY THAT WE HAVE

03:06:52.334 --> 03:06:53.802
BEEN ADDING. PRIOR TO THE

03:06:53.869 --> 03:06:55.771
PANDEMIC WE HAD ADDED OVER A

03:06:55.837 --> 03:06:56.872
THOUSAND BEDS TO TREAT THE

03:06:56.939 --> 03:06:59.074
INCREASING REFERRALS BUT WE

03:06:59.141 --> 03:07:00.809
STILL MAINTAIN THAT WEIGHT ONCE

03:07:00.876 --> 03:07:03.378
THOUGHT IT WAS ABOUT- SOMEWHERE

03:07:03.445 --> 03:07:04.379
IN THE EIGHT HUNDRED MARK WHEN

03:07:04.446 --> 03:07:06.148
WE WENT INTO EIGHT HUNDRED

03:07:06.214 --> 03:07:07.549
INDIVIDUALS ON THE WAIT LIST

03:07:07.616 --> 03:07:09.418
WHEN WE WENT INTO THE PANDEMIC.

03:07:09.484 --> 03:07:12.621
BUT THE PANDEMIC HAS CERTAINLY

03:07:12.688 --> 03:07:16.558
EXACERBATED THAT LAST. SO WE

03:07:16.625 --> 03:07:17.793
HAVE HAVE. DUE TO LIKE OUR

03:07:17.859 --> 03:07:19.528
CAPACITY AT THE STATE HOSPITALS

03:07:19.595 --> 03:07:21.229
IS BEEN REDUCED THROUGH THE

03:07:21.296 --> 03:07:23.932
PANDEMIC. BECAUSE WE OPERATED

03:07:23.999 --> 03:07:27.369
OUT OF BACK OUT THAT'S A 9295%

03:07:27.436 --> 03:07:29.504
OCCUPANCY ALL OF OUR BEDS WERE

03:07:29.571 --> 03:07:31.206
PRETTY MUCH AN ACTIVATED AN OPEN

03:07:31.273 --> 03:07:33.208
ACROSS ALL OF OUR HOSPITALS AND

03:07:33.275 --> 03:07:34.543
OVER THE COURSE OF ALL THIS

03:07:34.610 --> 03:07:35.944
CAPACITY EFFORTS TO TRY TO

03:07:36.011 --> 03:07:38.714
ADDRESS THE I. S. TEASE. AND

03:07:38.780 --> 03:07:41.516
ADDS WE HAD TO IMPLEMENT IN

03:07:41.583 --> 03:07:43.018
INFECTION CONTROL MEASURES

03:07:43.085 --> 03:07:45.887
RELATED TO IT IN RESPONSE TO THE

03:07:45.954 --> 03:07:47.289
PANDEMIC WE HAD TO CREATE A

03:07:47.356 --> 03:07:48.991
MISSION OBSERVATION UNITS WE

03:07:49.057 --> 03:07:50.626
HAVE TO CREATE ISOLATION UNITS

03:07:50.692 --> 03:07:52.894
WE CONTACT. GREAT PLACES FOR

03:07:52.961 --> 03:07:55.497
TWO. PERSONS WHO ARE UNDER THE

03:07:55.564 --> 03:07:57.599
INVESTIGATION FOR KOBE I'M

03:07:57.666 --> 03:07:59.534
BECAUSE WE HAVE A VERY LARGE

03:07:59.601 --> 03:08:01.970
DORM HOUSING UNITS WHICH IS

03:08:02.037 --> 03:08:04.640
VERY- OBVIOUSLY IN THE CONTEXT

03:08:04.706 --> 03:08:06.441
OF CODE IT IS VERY. VERY

03:08:06.508 --> 03:08:08.543
DIFFICULT TO MANAGE- IN THAT

03:08:08.610 --> 03:08:10.379
ENVIRONMENT TO MANAGE THE

03:08:10.445 --> 03:08:12.581
TRANSMISSION. SO IT OUR BEST

03:08:12.648 --> 03:08:15.250
DEFENSE IS TO TRY TO CAPTURE

03:08:15.317 --> 03:08:17.219
INDIVIDUALS AS THEY'RE COMING

03:08:17.285 --> 03:08:19.021
INTO OUR SYSTEM TO DETERMINE

03:08:19.087 --> 03:08:20.389
WHETHER THEY HAVE COVERED BEFORE

03:08:20.455 --> 03:08:22.157
WE MOVE INTO A HOUSING UNITS WE

03:08:22.224 --> 03:08:23.392
HAD TO CREATE ALL THAT THESE

03:08:23.458 --> 03:08:25.394
THESE UNITS THAT WE DIDN'T. HAVE

03:08:25.460 --> 03:08:27.529
A VACANT WE HAD TO CREATE THOSE

03:08:27.596 --> 03:08:29.531
SPACES SO OUR CAPACITY HAS BEEN

03:08:29.598 --> 03:08:32.634
REDUCED- WITH RESPECT TO THE

03:08:32.701 --> 03:08:34.169
TREATMENT OF IDEAS TO USE

03:08:34.236 --> 03:08:38.306
BECAUSE THAT IS ONE OF THE- THE

03:08:38.373 --> 03:08:41.043
QUICK TURN- PATIENT COMMITMENT

03:08:41.109 --> 03:08:43.045
TYPES. THAT YOU KNOW WE JUST

03:08:43.111 --> 03:08:44.713
CHARGE PEOPLE QUITE FREQUENTLY

03:08:44.780 --> 03:08:46.381
SO AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

03:08:46.448 --> 03:08:48.183
PANDEMIC WE WERE ABLE TO WE HAD

03:08:48.250 --> 03:08:50.485
TO HALT ADMISSIONS. AND THEN-

03:08:50.552 --> 03:08:53.121
CREATE THIS VACANT SPACE TO

03:08:53.188 --> 03:08:57.959
CREATE ALL THESE PANDEMIC.

03:08:58.026 --> 03:08:59.261
RESPONSE UNITS. MAYBE THEN I'LL

03:08:59.327 --> 03:09:00.495
LAST THE QUESTION DIRECT UP IT

03:09:00.562 --> 03:09:02.097
SEEMS THAT MOST OF OUR FOCUS HAS

03:09:02.164 --> 03:09:04.199
BEEN ON BEDS EVEN THIS YEAR WE

03:09:04.266 --> 03:09:05.200
HAVE TO EARN SIXTY SEVEN

03:09:05.267 --> 03:09:07.836
MILLION. AUTHORIZED TO HELP US

03:09:07.903 --> 03:09:10.038

YOU KNOW OUR SYSTEM HAS ALWAYS

03:09:58.086 --> 03:09:59.154
BEEN A HARD TO RECRUIT AND

03:09:59.221 --> 03:10:00.789
RETAIN SYSTEM GIVEN THE NATURE

03:10:00.856 --> 03:10:02.824
OF THE WORK THAT WE DO IN THE

03:10:02.891 --> 03:10:04.326
LOCATIONS OF THAT. THE

03:10:04.392 --> 03:10:05.193
GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS OF OUR

03:10:05.260 --> 03:10:06.762

I WOULD HAVE CIVIL SERVANTS BUT

NURSING POSITIONS- CERTAINLY

03:10:32.554 --> 03:10:33.555

RELATED TO THE PANDEMIC. BUT WE

AS A DEPARTMENT HAVE ALWAYS

03:10:43.198 --> 03:10:45.367
LOOKED TO BUILD OUR PIPE LINES

03:10:45.433 --> 03:10:47.269
INTO THAT INTO THE DEPARTMENT

03:10:47.335 --> 03:10:48.670
WITH PARTNERSHIPS WITH MANY

THOSE ARE LONG STANDING

03:11:18.733 --> 03:11:20.035

OUR STATE HOSPITALS ACROSS OUR

03:11:35.517 --> 03:11:38.119
STATE. THAT I BELIEVE WE NEED TO

03:11:38.186 --> 03:11:39.855
PAY MORE ATTENTION TO ENSURE

03:11:39.921 --> 03:11:42.090
THAT. WE ARE INVESTING IN THE

03:11:42.157 --> 03:11:44.459
WORK FORCE TO ADDRESS THIS

03:11:44.526 --> 03:11:46.494
HIGHEST T. ISSUE THAT HAS BOTH

03:11:46.561 --> 03:11:48.964
BEEN. VEXING AND HAVEN'T-

03:11:49.030 --> 03:11:50.966
COMPLICATED FOR US AS A STATE

03:11:51.032 --> 03:11:52.000
WE'RE GONNA NEED THOSE FRONT

03:11:52.067 --> 03:11:54.236
LINE WORKERS TO MAKE SURE WE ARE

03:11:54.302 --> 03:11:55.971

03:12:05.046 --> 03:12:07.148
COURT. AND SO I BELIEVE THAT

03:12:07.215 --> 03:12:08.717
THIS WILL BE A NECESSARY

03:12:08.783 --> 03:12:11.786
CONVERSATION AND- FINALLY JUST

03:12:11.853 --> 03:12:13.021
FOR FINANCE I BELIEVE IT'S

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:14.990
IMPORTANT FOR US TO MAKE SURE

03:12:15.056 --> 03:12:18.627
WE'RE PUTTING TO SCALE. THE FACT

03:12:18.693 --> 03:12:19.928

DSHS SUB ACUTE BED CAPACITY THAT

03:14:20.982 --> 03:14:24.419
THAT PROGRAMMING IS BEING- THIS

03:14:24.486 --> 03:14:27.355
IS SUPPORTING DIVERSION- BUT THE

03:14:27.422 --> 03:14:29.324
WAY THAT WE REALLY APPROACHED IT

03:14:29.391 --> 03:14:31.326
IS SORT OF CUSTOMISATION BASED

03:14:31.393 --> 03:14:33.194

A FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP THE

03:14:48.276 --> 03:14:50.011
MAY NOT BE CALLED A FULL SERVICE

03:14:50.078 --> 03:14:51.112
PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM WHERE AS

03:14:51.179 --> 03:14:52.614
OTHER COUNTY PROGRAMS ARE

03:14:52.680 --> 03:14:54.215

SUPPORT THAT. I WOULD POINT OUT

03:15:16.971 --> 03:15:18.873
AND I WILL NOW TRANSFER TO TOBY

03:15:18.940 --> 03:15:21.376
EWING AT THE BOTTOM OF PAGE

03:15:21.443 --> 03:15:23.044
TWENTY NINE AND THE AGENDA. IS A

03:15:23.111 --> 03:15:24.913
DESCRIPTION OF THE FULL SERVICE

03:15:24.979 --> 03:15:27.749
PARTNERSHIPS AND IT DESCRIBES IT

03:15:27.816 --> 03:15:29.117
AS THOSE WHO WERE INVOLVED OR AT

03:15:29.184 --> 03:15:30.485
RISK OF INVOLVEMENT WITH THE

AND FINALLY DO COUNTIES

03:16:24.873 --> 03:16:27.208
RECOGNIZE THAT FULL SERVICE

03:16:27.275 --> 03:16:28.977
PARTNERSHIPS MAY BE A

03:16:29.043 --> 03:16:32.013
SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION TO THE I.

03:16:32.080 --> 03:16:33.982
S. T. PROBLEM. THANK YOU MISTER

03:16:34.048 --> 03:16:36.184
CHAIR TOBY DOING ON BEHALF

03:16:36.251 --> 03:16:38.186
MENTAL COMMISSION- I THINK YOU

03:16:38.253 --> 03:16:39.954
KNOW YOUR QUESTION RAISES A

03:16:40.021 --> 03:16:41.589
NUMBER OF ISSUES SO IT'S A

03:16:41.656 --> 03:16:43.291
LITTLE HARD TO ANSWER YOUR

03:16:43.358 --> 03:16:44.659
QUESTION WITH A SIMPLE

03:16:44.726 --> 03:16:46.895
STRAIGHTFORWARD YES OR NO. FIRST

03:16:46.961 --> 03:16:48.129
IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THE

03:16:48.196 --> 03:16:49.330
ORIGINS OF THE FULL SERVICE

03:16:49.397 --> 03:16:51.299
PARTNERSHIP WHICH WAS A PILOT

03:16:51.366 --> 03:16:54.469
OUT OF LONG BEACH TO- TO TAKE

03:16:54.536 --> 03:16:56.037
PEOPLE OUT OF STATE HOSPITALS

03:16:56.104 --> 03:16:57.672
AND SERVE THEM IN THE COMMUNITY.

03:16:57.739 --> 03:16:59.240
AND THE MODEL IS CALLED A FULL

03:16:59.307 --> 03:17:00.408
SERVICE PARTNERSHIP FIRST

03:17:00.475 --> 03:17:01.809
BECAUSE IT'S A PARTNERSHIP

03:17:01.876 --> 03:17:03.311
BETWEEN THE PROVIDER AND THE

03:17:03.378 --> 03:17:04.312
INDIVIDUAL THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:17:04.379 --> 03:17:06.147
HERE. AND IT'S FULL SERVICE

03:17:06.214 --> 03:17:08.383
BECAUSE IT IS DESIGNED TO ALLOW

03:17:08.449 --> 03:17:10.885
THE PROVIDER TO DO WHATEVER IT

03:17:10.952 --> 03:17:12.554
TAKES WITH THE FUNDS THAT ARE

03:17:12.620 --> 03:17:14.289
AVAILABLE AND THAT IN THE IN THE

03:17:14.355 --> 03:17:17.258
GOALS HISTORICALLY. HAVE BEEN TO

03:17:17.325 --> 03:17:18.726
REDUCE HOSPITALIZATION

03:17:18.793 --> 03:17:20.828
INCARCERATION AND HOMELESSNESS.

03:17:20.895 --> 03:17:23.765
SO THE MODEL IS QUITE ELEGANT

03:17:23.831 --> 03:17:27.502
ITS IT'S- COMPREHENSIVE. WE HAVE

03:17:27.569 --> 03:17:30.104
WE HAVE A B. C. P. IN FRONT OF

03:17:30.171 --> 03:17:31.773
YOU NOW- SO WE HAVE NOT ACTUALLY

03:17:31.839 --> 03:17:34.108
BEEN ABLE TO ENGAGE TO REALLY

03:17:34.175 --> 03:17:35.476
UNDERSTAND. HOW COUNTIES USING

03:17:35.543 --> 03:17:36.544
THE FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIP

03:17:36.611 --> 03:17:38.146
MODEL. THE REASON YOUR QUESTION

03:17:38.213 --> 03:17:40.348
IS COMPLICATED ANSWER QUESTIONS

03:17:40.415 --> 03:17:43.284
COMPLICATED IS BECAUSE- FOSTERS

03:17:43.351 --> 03:17:44.452
PARTNERSHIPS ARE TYPICALLY FIND

03:17:44.519 --> 03:17:46.521
WITH AN HSA FUNDS IN THERE RE

03:17:46.588 --> 03:17:47.422
PRO HAVE BISSCHEN TIME USING

03:17:47.488 --> 03:17:49.123
IMAGES SAY FUNDS. FOR PEOPLE WHO

03:17:49.190 --> 03:17:51.926
ARE IN NON VOLUNTARY SCENARIOS

03:17:51.993 --> 03:17:53.461
AND SO THERE'S SOME QUESTIONS

03:17:53.528 --> 03:17:55.263
AROUND THE NATURE OF DIVERSION

03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:57.298
AND SOMEONE WHO MAY BE UNDER A

03:17:57.365 --> 03:18:01.002
COURT ORDER- HAVING BEEN DEEMED

03:18:01.069 --> 03:18:01.936
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. I

03:18:02.003 --> 03:18:03.838
THINK THE IMPORTANT LESSON HERE

03:18:03.905 --> 03:18:05.907
ISN'T THE SOURCE OF FUNDING. IT

03:18:05.974 --> 03:18:07.175
MAY BE THAT THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:18:07.242 --> 03:18:08.543
SERVICES ACT FUNDS BECAUSE

03:18:08.610 --> 03:18:10.645
THEY'RE SO FLEXIBLE CAN BE USED

03:18:10.712 --> 03:18:12.180
WELL BEYOND WHAT CAN BE DONE

03:18:12.247 --> 03:18:14.349
WITH MANTA CAL- BUT WHAT'S

03:18:14.415 --> 03:18:16.251
REALLY IMPORTANT IS THE MODEL.

03:18:16.317 --> 03:18:18.386
HOW CAN WE DESIGN SYSTEMS HOW DO

03:18:18.453 --> 03:18:20.755
WE DESIGN THE CAPACITY TO LEARN

03:18:20.822 --> 03:18:22.724
FROM THE STRATEGIES TO WORK WITH

03:18:22.790 --> 03:18:24.292
INDIVIDUALS IN A WHATEVER IT

03:18:24.359 --> 03:18:25.693
TAKES APPROACH. BECAUSE WE

03:18:25.760 --> 03:18:27.328
RECOGNIZE THAT IF WE DON'T DO

03:18:27.395 --> 03:18:29.597
THAT WORK THERE'S A FAR HIGHER

03:18:29.664 --> 03:18:31.799
PERSONAL FAMILY COMMUNITY AND

03:18:31.866 --> 03:18:33.868
FISCAL COST. WHEN PEOPLE

03:18:33.935 --> 03:18:36.504
ACTUALLY END UP IN THE STATE

03:18:36.571 --> 03:18:37.305
HOSPITAL RETURNING TO A STATE

03:18:37.372 --> 03:18:40.341
HOSPITAL. FOR EXAMPLE SO I THINK

03:18:40.408 --> 03:18:41.943
YOU KNOW WE WANT TO ANSWER THAT

03:18:42.010 --> 03:18:43.911
QUESTION AND THAT'S PARTLY WHY

03:18:43.978 --> 03:18:45.313
WE COME TO YOU WITH THE BUDGET

03:18:45.380 --> 03:18:46.514
CHANGE PROPOSAL. TO REALLY

03:18:46.581 --> 03:18:48.149
BETTER UNDERSTAND FULL SERVICE

03:18:48.216 --> 03:18:49.851
PARTNERSHIPS THE KINDS OF

03:18:49.917 --> 03:18:51.152
METRICS THAT ARE BEING USED THE

03:18:51.219 --> 03:18:53.621
DATA THAT ARE BEING COLLECTED-

03:18:53.688 --> 03:18:55.423
THE PILOT THAT IS REFERENCED IN

03:18:55.490 --> 03:18:57.392
THE ANALYSIS IT WAS A SMALL

03:18:57.458 --> 03:18:58.660
PILOT WITH A HANDFUL OF

03:18:58.726 --> 03:19:00.695
COUNTIES. REALLY TO STRENGTHEN

03:19:00.762 --> 03:19:02.730
THEIR CAPACITY TO BE OUTCOME

03:19:02.797 --> 03:19:04.666
FOCUSED IN THEIR CONTRACTING

03:19:04.732 --> 03:19:06.534
WITH COMMUNITY PARTNERS. AND SO

03:19:06.601 --> 03:19:08.736
WE SEE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND

03:19:08.803 --> 03:19:11.239
THAT WORK TO EXPLORE THE KINDS

03:19:11.306 --> 03:19:13.808
OF QUESTIONS YOU'RE ASKING AND

03:19:13.875 --> 03:19:16.210
THEN TO SAY. EVEN IF WE MAY NOT

03:19:16.277 --> 03:19:18.346
BE ABLE TO USE THEM AND JUST SAY

03:19:18.413 --> 03:19:19.347
FUNDS TO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION

03:19:19.414 --> 03:19:20.548
OF THIS WHATEVER IT TAKES

03:19:20.615 --> 03:19:22.183
APPROACH. HOW CAN THE LESSONS

03:19:22.250 --> 03:19:23.818
LEARNED THROUGH THE F. S. P.

03:19:23.885 --> 03:19:25.920
COMPONENT AT THE MHSAA REALLY

03:19:25.987 --> 03:19:27.922
BEGIN TO DRIVE STREET. DRIVE

03:19:27.989 --> 03:19:29.791
STRATEGIES TO PREVENT THE

03:19:29.857 --> 03:19:30.658
JUSTICE INVOLVEMENT THE

03:19:30.725 --> 03:19:33.194
HOMELESSNESS THAT IS LEADING TO

03:19:33.261 --> 03:19:34.495
THE LARGE NUMBERS OF FOLKS

03:19:34.562 --> 03:19:36.297
LANDING AT THE DOOR OF THE

03:19:36.364 --> 03:19:37.999
DEPARTMENT TATE HOSPITALS. SO

03:19:38.066 --> 03:19:40.201
THE BEST I CAN TELL YOU IS WE'RE

03:19:40.268 --> 03:19:41.202
STILL WORKING TO FIGURE THAT OUT

03:19:41.269 --> 03:19:43.504
WE WANT TO SEPARATE OUT THE

03:19:43.571 --> 03:19:45.006
PROGRAMMATIC. SIDE A FULL

03:19:45.073 --> 03:19:46.541
SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS FROM THE

03:19:46.607 --> 03:19:48.409
FUNDING SIDE SO THAT THE LESSONS

03:19:48.476 --> 03:19:49.811
THAT WE LEARNED FROM THE MHSAA

03:19:49.877 --> 03:19:52.547
CAN EXPAND INTO FOR EXAMPLE HOW

03:19:52.613 --> 03:19:54.749
WE MIGHT USE MEDICARE FUNDING.

03:19:54.816 --> 03:19:56.484
HOW WE CAN USE OTHER SOURCES OF

03:19:56.551 --> 03:19:58.119
DOLLARS AS WELL AND HOW THE

03:19:58.186 --> 03:20:01.122
STATE MIGHT DO. MORE UPSTREAM

03:20:01.189 --> 03:20:02.857
WORKS THAT WE CAN REDUCE DEMANDS

03:20:02.924 --> 03:20:05.493
ON OUR STATE HOUSE ARE VERY

03:20:05.560 --> 03:20:06.594
EXPENSIVE STATE HOSPITAL SYSTEM

03:20:06.661 --> 03:20:09.063
. HELP ANSWER. NOW WHAT IT DOES

03:20:09.130 --> 03:20:11.265
NOT WE WILL FOLLOW UP MORE IN.

03:20:11.332 --> 03:20:12.600
THE FINAL QUESTION MAYBE

03:20:12.667 --> 03:20:15.002
RHETORICAL BUT I DO FEEL IT

03:20:15.069 --> 03:20:17.004
NEEDS TO BE ASK I WAS REALLY.

03:20:17.071 --> 03:20:20.308
MOVED BYSANDRA- CITING BERG'S.

03:20:20.375 --> 03:20:22.243
TESTIMONY THAT THAT'D LIKE TO BE

03:20:22.310 --> 03:20:23.378
ABLE TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION

03:20:23.444 --> 03:20:25.713
OR STATE HOSPITAL. HOW DO WE

03:20:25.780 --> 03:20:27.048
MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T

03:20:27.115 --> 03:20:30.618
HAPPEN AGAIN WHAT HAVE WE DONE

03:20:30.685 --> 03:20:31.819
TO PUT IN PLACE TO MAKE SURE

03:20:31.886 --> 03:20:34.756
THAT. WHAT HAPPENED A SANDERS

03:20:34.822 --> 03:20:37.458
COUSIN DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN.

THANK YOU YES AND THE- A COUPLE

03:20:41.262 --> 03:20:43.364
OF THINGS TO MENTION WITH

03:20:43.431 --> 03:20:45.867
RESPECT TO THAT PROCESS-

03:20:45.933 --> 03:20:49.070
OBVIOUSLY I CAN'T- SAYING-

03:20:49.137 --> 03:20:50.505
MENTAL HEALTH ORGANIZATION CAN'T

RECALLED DIRECTORS ARE GRATEFUL

03:28:42.142 --> 03:28:44.245
FOR THE LEGISLATURE'S ALLOCATION

03:28:44.311 --> 03:28:45.913
OF TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS

03:28:45.980 --> 03:28:47.381
. IN INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING LAST

03:28:47.448 --> 03:28:48.883
YEAR'S BUDGET AND EXCITED TO

03:28:48.949 --> 03:28:50.284
START SPENDING DOWN THESE FUNDS

03:28:50.351 --> 03:28:51.919
TO MAKE CRITICAL INVESTMENTS IN

03:28:51.986 --> 03:28:53.120
PUBLIC BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:28:53.187 --> 03:28:55.289
CONTINUE ONE HISTORICALLY

03:28:55.356 --> 03:28:56.523
BECAUSE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:28:56.590 --> 03:28:58.592
REIMBURSEMENT HAS BEEN CAPPED AT

03:28:58.659 --> 03:29:01.128
COSTS. WE HAVE NOT HAD THE

03:29:01.195 --> 03:29:03.497
ABILITY TO BUILD A RESERVE OR

03:29:03.564 --> 03:29:05.099
PROFIT INCREMENTAL INVESTMENT

03:29:05.165 --> 03:29:06.967
LIKE OTHER PARTS OF HEALTH CARE

03:29:07.034 --> 03:29:08.969
WE'VE HAD A FEW FUNDS EARMARKED

03:29:09.036 --> 03:29:10.204
FOR INFRASTRUCTURE SO WE REALLY

03:29:10.271 --> 03:29:12.306
HAVE BEEN CHALLENGED TO BUILD UP

03:29:12.373 --> 03:29:14.074
ADDITIONAL CAPACITY. IN THE FALL

03:29:14.141 --> 03:29:15.509
OF LAST YEAR A COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

03:29:15.576 --> 03:29:16.877
HEALTH DIRECTORS COMMISSIONED A

03:29:16.944 --> 03:29:19.013
RAND STUDY INPATIENT BED

03:29:19.079 --> 03:29:20.714
CAPACITY THROUGHOUT THE STATE

03:29:20.781 --> 03:29:22.750
AND WHAT WE FOUND ALIGNS CLOSELY

03:29:22.816 --> 03:29:24.752
WITH THE STATE'S GAPS ANALYSIS

03:29:24.818 --> 03:29:26.053
BUT PAINS AND MORE NUANCED

03:29:26.120 --> 03:29:28.756
PICTURE. FIRST WE NEED TO LOOK

03:29:28.822 --> 03:29:29.423
AT THROUGHPUT BECAUSE OF

03:29:29.490 --> 03:29:31.392
BOTTLENECKS AT THE SUBACUTE AND

03:29:31.458 --> 03:29:33.661
RESIDENTIAL LEVELS CAN CAN

03:29:33.727 --> 03:29:34.762
IMPACT A PATH TO THEIR HIGHER

03:29:34.828 --> 03:29:36.730
LEVELS SECOND WE HAVE DIFFERENT

03:29:36.797 --> 03:29:38.465
NEEDS AND DIFFERENT REGIONS OF

03:29:38.532 --> 03:29:39.566
THE STATE WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT

03:29:39.633 --> 03:29:41.936
WE HAVE ROUGHLY 65% OF THE

03:29:42.002 --> 03:29:43.570
NEEDED CAPACITY ACROSS ALL

03:29:43.637 --> 03:29:45.606
LEVELS OF ACUTE CARE FOR ADULTS.

03:29:45.673 --> 03:29:47.741
AND ONLY 57% OF NEEDED

03:29:47.808 --> 03:29:49.643
RESIDENTIAL LEVELS OF CARE AND

03:29:49.710 --> 03:29:51.478
THIS IS SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE WITH

03:29:51.545 --> 03:29:54.481
THE EXCEPTION OF INPATIENT UNITS

03:29:54.548 --> 03:29:56.016
IN GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITALS.

03:29:56.083 --> 03:29:57.785
THE REMAINDER OF THE CUTE AND

03:29:57.851 --> 03:29:59.653
RESIDENTIAL CARE LARGELY FALLS

03:29:59.720 --> 03:30:01.722
UNDER THE IMD EXCLUSION HAVING

03:30:01.789 --> 03:30:03.624
OVER SIXTEEN BADS AND THEREFORE

03:30:03.691 --> 03:30:06.126
IS ENTIRELY FUNDED WITH NO

03:30:06.193 --> 03:30:07.861
MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS OF THE

03:30:07.928 --> 03:30:09.697
COUNTY PICKS THAT. ARE MOST

03:30:09.763 --> 03:30:14.335
SEVERELY IMPACTED. REGIONS OF

03:30:14.401 --> 03:30:15.436
THE STATE AND THE CENTRAL

03:30:15.502 --> 03:30:17.171
VALLEY. RETICULAR AND THIS SAN

03:30:17.237 --> 03:30:18.505
JOAQUIN VALLEY LACKS A- AND THAT

03:30:18.572 --> 03:30:20.474
IS WHY WE ARE SEEING AN

03:30:20.541 --> 03:30:21.542
INCREASING NEED. LEAVE THIS

03:30:21.608 --> 03:30:22.309
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT CAN

03:30:22.376 --> 03:30:23.744
PAY OFF IF IT IS DONE RIGHT AND

03:30:23.811 --> 03:30:25.813
WE URGE THE STATE TO CONSIDER

03:30:25.879 --> 03:30:27.548
EXPANDING ON THESE ANALYSES. TO

03:30:27.614 --> 03:30:28.816
FURTHER STUDY GAPS IN THE

03:30:28.882 --> 03:30:30.184
CHILDREN'S CONTINUUM OF CARE AS

03:30:30.250 --> 03:30:32.653
WELL AS FOR SUBSTANCE USE

03:30:32.720 --> 03:30:33.787
DISORDER SERVICES. THE STATE MAY

03:30:33.854 --> 03:30:35.589
WISH TO CONSIDER DELAYING ITS

03:30:35.656 --> 03:30:36.390
FUNDING FOR CHILDREN'S CAPACITY

03:30:36.457 --> 03:30:37.458
FOR EXAMPLE UNTIL IT HAS A

03:30:37.524 --> 03:30:39.660
SIMILARLY RIGOROUS ANALYSIS OF

03:30:39.727 --> 03:30:41.128
REGIONAL NEEDS IN THE CHILDREN'S

03:30:41.195 --> 03:30:43.564
SYSTEM OF CARE WHICH IS FAR MORE

03:30:43.630 --> 03:30:45.499
COMPLEX. OUR ANALYSIS ALSO FOUND

03:30:45.566 --> 03:30:46.100
THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

03:30:46.166 --> 03:30:49.103
CHALLENGES- ARE UNIQUE TO THE

03:30:49.169 --> 03:30:50.404
TYPE OF CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE

03:30:50.471 --> 03:30:52.906

CERTAIN CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS

03:30:58.212 --> 03:31:00.147
LIKE OUR CENTER SEX OFFENSES.

03:31:00.214 --> 03:31:01.648

CARPET OR GENETIC BRAIN INJURY

03:31:05.986 --> 03:31:07.821
CHALLENGING PRESS THE PLACE AND

ALL FOR IN AN ELDER. NEARLY

03:31:27.841 --> 03:31:29.777
IMPOSSIBLE TO ATTEND TO BUT WE

03:31:29.843 --> 03:31:32.713

MOST CHALLENGING PEOPLE TO PLACE

03:48:03.903 --> 03:48:06.572
BASIS WHERE PATIENTS COME TO US.

03:48:06.639 --> 03:48:08.241
IN CRISIS PATIENTS ARE HAVING

03:48:08.307 --> 03:48:10.676
MENTAL HEALTH CRISES AND THEY

03:48:10.743 --> 03:48:12.311
DON'T HAVE ANYWHERE ELSE TO GO

03:48:12.378 --> 03:48:13.613
I'M A BIG BELIEVER THAT PATIENTS

03:48:13.679 --> 03:48:15.348
SHOULD COME TO THE EMERGENCY

03:48:15.415 --> 03:48:16.182
DEPARTMENT BUT THEY SHOULDN'T

03:48:16.249 --> 03:48:17.817
STAY THERE INDEFINITELY AND THEY

03:48:17.884 --> 03:48:19.085
SHOULDN'T BE DIFFERENT DAYS ON

03:48:19.152 --> 03:48:22.188
END WITHOUT TREATMENT. SO WE

03:48:22.255 --> 03:48:23.756
BELIEVE WE HAVE A SOLUTION

03:48:23.823 --> 03:48:27.693
SOMETHING THAT WE'VE IMPLEMENTED

03:48:27.760 --> 03:48:28.661
AT MERCY ST ONE BECAUSE CENTER.

03:48:28.728 --> 03:48:30.029
AND IT IS CALLED THE EMPOWER

03:48:30.096 --> 03:48:31.597
MODEL WE HERE TO ADVOCATE FOR

03:48:31.664 --> 03:48:33.299
FUNDING OF THAT KIND OF A MODEL.

03:48:33.366 --> 03:48:35.601
BEFORE THE END PASSED MODEL. WE

03:48:35.668 --> 03:48:38.004
WOULD ASSESS PATIENTS AND THEY

03:48:38.071 --> 03:48:39.872
WOULD GO THREE VERY STRINGENT

03:48:39.939 --> 03:48:41.174
LINEAR PROCESS OF MEDICAL

03:48:41.240 --> 03:48:42.875

INPATIENT UNIT. THAT PROCESS

03:48:48.381 --> 03:48:50.316
WOULD TAKE ONE TO TWO DAYS.

03:48:50.383 --> 03:48:51.651
AFTER THIS AND HALF MODEL

03:48:51.717 --> 03:48:53.119

03:48:58.424 --> 03:49:00.226
QUICKLY AND GET THEM THE CARE

03:49:00.293 --> 03:49:02.161
THAT THEY NEED IMMEDIATELY. NOT

IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN

03:49:11.137 --> 03:49:12.371
AROUND FOR A LITTLE WHILE AND

03:49:12.438 --> 03:49:13.673
ACTUALLY IT'S BEEN EXTERNALLY

03:49:13.739 --> 03:49:15.775

PREVIOUSLY. AND IT ALSO REDUCES

03:49:41.300 --> 03:49:43.669
THE LENGTH OF STAY FOR INPATIENT

03:49:43.736 --> 03:49:45.204

MENTAL ILLNESS. AND I JUST

03:51:43.256 --> 03:51:44.657
WANTED TO REITERATE WHAT WE

03:51:44.724 --> 03:51:46.926
HEARD FROM DOCTOR THOMAS THAT

03:51:46.993 --> 03:51:49.161
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM WE ARE NOT

03:51:49.228 --> 03:51:50.263
MEETING THE NEEDS OF OUR

03:51:50.329 --> 03:51:52.298
PATIENTS AND WE NEED TO PROVIDE

03:51:52.365 --> 03:51:54.433
RESOURCES TO THE PEOPLE WHO MEET

03:51:54.500 --> 03:51:56.736
THEM AND DESIGN OUR SYSTEMS TO

03:51:56.802 --> 03:51:58.204
MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE.

03:51:58.271 --> 03:51:59.372
RATHER THAN CURRENTLY WHAT WE

03:51:59.438 --> 03:52:01.540
HAVE DONE WHICH IS DESIGNED THE

03:52:01.607 --> 03:52:03.242
SYSTEM TO DRIVE PEOPLE THROUGH

03:52:03.309 --> 03:52:08.114
IT- WE KNOW THAT. THE NEED FOR

03:52:08.180 --> 03:52:09.815
MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT AND

03:52:09.882 --> 03:52:12.018
SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT. IS JUST

03:52:12.084 --> 03:52:13.786
INCREASING IN OUR COMMUNITIES

03:52:13.853 --> 03:52:15.321
AND WE HAVE CONTINUED TO SEE

03:52:15.388 --> 03:52:16.956
INCREASES IN EIGHTY VISITS FOR

03:52:17.023 --> 03:52:18.224
MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE

03:52:18.291 --> 03:52:20.259
USE. AND WE WERE LIKELY TO

03:52:20.326 --> 03:52:23.262
CONTINUE TO SEE AN INCREASE IN

03:52:23.329 --> 03:52:25.264
EDIE VISITS. BECAUSE OF OUR

03:52:25.331 --> 03:52:28.100
SHARED TRAUMA AND AS WE RECOVER

03:52:28.167 --> 03:52:30.169
FROM KOBE NINETEEN. AND I THINK

03:52:30.236 --> 03:52:31.671
IT'S A FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE

03:52:31.737 --> 03:52:33.272
IT'S HARD RATE WE WANT TO THINK

03:52:33.339 --> 03:52:35.308
OF AN EASY VISIT IT'S A FAILURE

03:52:35.374 --> 03:52:36.909
AND WE WORRY ABOUT WHAT IT SAYS

03:52:36.976 --> 03:52:40.279
ABOUT US- AND WE BLAME PEOPLE

03:52:40.346 --> 03:52:41.947
FOR GOING TO THE WRONG PLACE AND

03:52:42.014 --> 03:52:43.849
NOT UNDERSTANDING THE SYSTEM

03:52:43.916 --> 03:52:45.985
THAT WE HAVE DESIGNED. AND

03:52:46.052 --> 03:52:48.454
INSTEAD WE SHOULD BEGIN WITH OUR

03:52:48.521 --> 03:52:51.624
DUTY TO TAKE CARE OF EACH PERSON

03:52:51.691 --> 03:52:53.592
AND FROM WHAT I HEAR ABOUT THIS-

03:52:53.659 --> 03:52:56.028
HALF SYSTEM. WHAT THEY'RE TRYING

03:52:56.095 --> 03:52:58.597
TO DO IS EXACTLY THIS IS TO

03:52:58.664 --> 03:53:01.133
BRING THE RESOURCES TO THE

03:53:01.200 --> 03:53:03.169
PATIENT RATHER THAN TAKING THE

03:53:03.235 --> 03:53:05.137
PATIENT TO THE RESOURCE. WERE

03:53:05.204 --> 03:53:07.506
EVERYWHERE SOMEONE ASKS FOR HELP

03:53:07.573 --> 03:53:09.842
WE NEED TO BE THERE AND GIVE

03:53:09.909 --> 03:53:11.711
THEM THE HELP THAT TEY NEED.

03:53:11.777 --> 03:53:12.845
EVERY HEALTH CARE COME IN

03:53:12.912 --> 03:53:15.448
COUNTER EVERY EDIE VISIT IS AN

03:53:15.514 --> 03:53:17.550
OPPORTUNITY TO DO BETTER AND

03:53:17.616 --> 03:53:18.684
GIVE PEOPLE THE HELP THAT THEY

03:53:18.751 --> 03:53:20.386
NEED. AND SO I SWEAR LIKE

03:53:20.453 --> 03:53:22.288
THINKING ABOUT HOW TO HELP OUR

03:53:22.355 --> 03:53:24.357
<u>&lt;c.green&gt;OMMUNITY AT A MINIMUM WE SHOULD&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:53:24.423 --> 03:53:26.625
THINK ABOUT HOW TO BRING THESE

03:53:26.692 --> 03:53:28.194
RESOURCES. SUCH AS PEER SUPPORT

03:53:28.260 --> 03:53:30.463
SPECIALIST COUNSELLORS MENTAL

03:53:30.529 --> 03:53:33.799
HEALTH WORKERS TO THE PEOPLE WHO

03:53:33.866 --> 03:53:35.334
NEED THEM- AND SO THAT IS

03:53:35.401 --> 03:53:37.770
EXACTLY THIS THE SYSTEM THAT DR

03:53:37.837 --> 03:53:40.339
THOMAS DESCRIBED. AND WE KNOW

03:53:40.406 --> 03:53:42.208
WHERE THE PEOPLE ARE THERE OFTEN

03:53:42.274 --> 03:53:43.809
IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT.

03:53:43.876 --> 03:53:47.279
WAITING TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS THE

03:53:47.346 --> 03:53:49.048
TREATMENT THAT THEY NEED-

03:53:49.115 --> 03:53:51.751
BECAUSE WE HAVE SPECIFICALLY

03:53:51.817 --> 03:53:54.453
EXCLUDED EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS.

03:53:54.520 --> 03:53:56.355
FROM THESE REIMBURSEMENT AND

03:53:56.422 --> 03:53:58.124
BILLING MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT

03:53:58.190 --> 03:53:59.859
THE RESOURCES THAT PEOPLE NEED

03:53:59.925 --> 03:54:02.061
AND SO I THINK. IF WE ACTUALLY

03:54:02.128 --> 03:54:05.030
THINK ABOUT THE PEOPLE THAT WERE

03:54:05.097 --> 03:54:07.099
TRYING TO SIR. AND DESIGN THE

03:54:07.166 --> 03:54:09.635
SYSTEM FOR THEM RATHER THAN FROM

03:54:09.702 --> 03:54:11.170
THEN FOR US WE START TO

03:54:11.237 --> 03:54:13.139
UNDERSTAND. THIS IS WHERE WE

03:54:13.205 --> 03:54:15.941
NEED TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE CARE-

03:54:16.008 --> 03:54:17.777
BECAUSE IT IS JUST SO EASY FOR

03:54:17.843 --> 03:54:20.413
PEOPLE TO GET LOST IN THE SYSTEM

03:54:20.479 --> 03:54:21.781
AND SO WE NEED TO HAVE THESE

03:54:21.847 --> 03:54:25.951
RESOURCES WHERE. THEY NEED THEM

03:54:26.018 --> 03:54:27.186
WHEN THEY NEED THEM. THANK YOU.

03:55:29.348 --> 03:55:30.883
AND WHEN IT GETS CHARGED I AM

03:55:30.950 --> 03:55:36.789
GIVING NO RESOURCES MAY. BE A

03:55:36.856 --> 03:55:37.957
SHORT TERM PRESCRIPTION. AND

03:55:38.023 --> 03:55:40.493
THIS HAS BECAUSE MY MENTAL

03:55:40.559 --> 03:55:42.661
HEALTH CRISES TO BE SO MUCH

03:55:42.728 --> 03:55:45.064
MORE- PROLONGED THEN THEY NEED

03:55:45.130 --> 03:55:47.833
TO BE. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WHEN

03:55:47.900 --> 03:55:50.236
YOUR PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO

03:55:50.302 --> 03:55:51.036
NAVIGATE THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:55:51.103 --> 03:55:52.505
SYSTEM THEY JUST KNOW- I MEAN

03:55:52.571 --> 03:55:54.907

EMERGENCY ROOM IN CRISIS BUT I

03:56:00.579 --> 03:56:01.680
DIDN'T MEET THE GUIDELINES FOR

03:56:01.747 --> 03:56:04.416
HOSPITALIZATION. SO FOR SOME

03:56:04.483 --> 03:56:06.085
REASON THAT MEANT THAT THEY

03:56:06.151 --> 03:56:09.255
COULDN'T HELP ME- THERE'S SO

03:56:09.321 --> 03:56:11.357
MANY SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO

03:56:11.423 --> 03:56:13.225

03:56:17.096 --> 03:56:18.464
BEEN A LOT OF SERVICES I

AS THE EMERGENCY ROOM IT IS

03:56:26.171 --> 03:56:27.706
DISCONNECTED FROM THE MENTAL

03:56:27.773 --> 03:56:30.776

03:56:35.648 --> 03:56:38.817
WRONG PLACE FOR PEOPLE IN A

03:56:38.884 --> 03:56:40.152
MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS. I THINK

03:56:40.219 --> 03:56:42.154
THAT WE REALLY NEED TO SET UP IN

03:56:42.221 --> 03:56:44.423
THE EMERGENCY ROOM TO BE

03:56:44.490 --> 03:56:46.125

SO ALL OFTHESE ISSUES ARE

04:05:20.972 --> 04:05:22.574
REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

04:05:22.641 --> 04:05:23.975

STABILIZATION UNITS- AND THIS IS

04:06:03.882 --> 04:06:05.450
BASED ON THE EXPERIENCES OF

04:06:05.517 --> 04:06:06.952
COUNTIES IN TRYING TO BUILD OUT

04:06:07.018 --> 04:06:09.087
THE A FEW CAPACITY OVER THE LAST

04:06:09.154 --> 04:06:11.323
SEVERAL YEARS. FIRST I WANT TO

IS- IN STATE REGULATION. AND

04:06:25.036 --> 04:06:27.072
OFTEN TIMES BECAUSE WE ARE

04:06:27.139 --> 04:06:29.207
TRYING TO TRANSFER INDIVIDUALS

THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CSU

04:06:46.525 --> 04:06:47.959
THROUGHOUT THE STATE ARE VERY

04:06:48.026 --> 04:06:50.462
SMALL THEIR UNDER SIXTEEN BEDS

04:06:50.529 --> 04:06:52.497
SO THAT COUNTIES CAN RECEIVE

04:06:52.564 --> 04:06:54.099
MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THOSE

04:06:54.166 --> 04:06:56.201
SERVICES AS THE ISSUES FALL

04:06:56.268 --> 04:06:58.303
UNDER THE I AND B. EXCLUSION.

04:06:58.370 --> 04:06:59.938
THIS PART ALSO CURTAILED ARE

04:07:00.005 --> 04:07:02.374
LIMITED THE EXPANSION AND THE

04:07:02.440 --> 04:07:04.910
SUSTAINABILITY AND VIABILITY OF

04:07:04.976 --> 04:07:06.811
THE EXCUSE. IN THE RECENT CALL

04:07:06.878 --> 04:07:08.780
THE PANDEMIC WE SAW THAT THOSE

THROUGHPUT ISSUES WERE

04:07:09.848 --> 04:07:12.684
SIGNIFICANTLY EXACERBATED AS

04:07:12.751 --> 04:07:14.719
MANY OF THE RECEIVING FACILITIES

04:07:14.786 --> 04:07:15.820
WHETHER THEY ARE AT HIGHER

04:07:15.887 --> 04:07:18.256

KOBE NEGATIVE PASSED OR OTHER

04:07:21.259 --> 04:07:22.627
THINGS THAT WERE REALLY

04:07:22.694 --> 04:07:24.296
DIFFICULT TO SECURE WITHIN THAT

04:07:24.362 --> 04:07:25.463
TWENTY FOUR HOUR PERIOD. WHICH

04:07:25.530 --> 04:07:28.366
JUST MADE- SISTEMI SERVICES EVEN

04:07:28.433 --> 04:07:30.468
MORE DIFFICULT AND AS YOU HEARD

04:07:30.535 --> 04:07:32.771
FROM THE RAND ANALYSIS WHICH- DR

04:07:32.837 --> 04:07:34.406
KELLY REFERENCED EARLIER

04:07:34.472 --> 04:07:35.440
COUNTIES CURRENTLY HAVE

04:07:35.507 --> 04:07:37.342
SIGNIFICANT GAPS DEPENDING ON

04:07:37.409 --> 04:07:39.778
REGION- IN EITHER INPATIENT

04:07:39.844 --> 04:07:42.647
SUBACUTE OR RESIDENTIAL LEVELS

04:07:42.714 --> 04:07:44.082
OF CARE. I ALSO WANT TO

04:07:44.149 --> 04:07:45.383
HIGHLIGHT THAT SACRAMENTO COUNTY

04:07:45.450 --> 04:07:47.852
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WAS

04:07:47.919 --> 04:07:50.589
THE SORT OF- INNOVATOR WHO

04:07:50.655 --> 04:07:53.325
BROUGHT FORWARD THE CONCEPT OF

04:07:53.391 --> 04:07:55.560
THE HOSPITAL BASED CSU WHICH WAS

04:07:55.627 --> 04:07:59.764
FUNDED BY THE OAC- AND THAT

04:07:59.831 --> 04:08:01.833
PARTNERSHIP WITH BIRD THROUGH

04:08:01.900 --> 04:08:02.601
OUR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

04:08:02.667 --> 04:08:05.136
DEPARTMENT. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO

04:08:05.203 --> 04:08:07.806
TRY TO REPLICATE- SOMETHING THAT

04:08:07.872 --> 04:08:09.774
IS AN INNOVATION PROJECT WE

04:08:09.841 --> 04:08:11.676
OFTEN NEED TO MODIFY IT

04:08:11.743 --> 04:08:13.478
SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH THAT IT IS

04:08:13.545 --> 04:08:15.013
CONSIDERED A DIFFERENT

04:08:15.080 --> 04:08:17.983
INNOVATION IN THE EYES OF OUR-

04:08:18.049 --> 04:08:18.950
OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY

04:08:19.017 --> 04:08:21.586
COMMISSION. SO MOVING FORWARD WE

04:08:21.653 --> 04:08:22.787
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

04:08:22.854 --> 04:08:24.289
LOOK AT POTENTIALLY MAKING

04:08:24.356 --> 04:08:28.159
CHANGES TO CSU REIMBURSEMENT- IN

04:08:28.226 --> 04:08:30.962
ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN GET

04:08:31.029 --> 04:08:33.031
THE MOST OUT OF THIS LEVEL OF

04:08:33.098 --> 04:08:34.966
CAPACITY AND WE ALSO NEED TO

04:08:35.033 --> 04:08:36.935
ENCOURAGE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS

04:08:37.002 --> 04:08:38.803

STRUCTURES- WITH THOSE TWO STEPS

04:08:48.613 --> 04:08:50.682
WE THINK THAT WE COULD DO A LOT

04:08:50.749 --> 04:08:53.285
MORE TO- ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS

04:08:53.351 --> 04:08:56.554
DO RECEIVE CARE- ON PAR WITH THE

04:08:56.621 --> 04:08:58.523

04:10:42.060 --> 04:10:43.895
CHAIR JUST A COUPLE OF COMMENTS

04:10:43.962 --> 04:10:46.464
AND QUESTIONS I MEAN ONE OF THE

04:10:46.531 --> 04:10:49.868
COMMENTS FROM THE- HERE- SUPPORT

04:10:49.934 --> 04:10:52.637
SPECIALS FROM UC DAVIS TALKED

04:10:52.704 --> 04:10:53.938
ABOUT. HOW ENTERING THE

04:10:54.005 --> 04:10:56.608
EMERGENCY ROOM- TURNED INTO A

04:10:56.674 --> 04:10:57.876
MINIMUM I THINK FOUR TO FIVE

04:10:57.942 --> 04:11:00.111
HOURS. BUT THEN ULTIMATELY WHEN

04:11:00.178 --> 04:11:01.446
THEY WERE SEEN THEY WERE THEY

04:11:01.513 --> 04:11:03.815
WERE- GIVEN BASICALLY LACK OF

04:11:03.882 --> 04:11:05.917
RESOURCES TO MOVE FORWARD. WE

04:11:05.984 --> 04:11:07.318
ALSO HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THE

04:11:07.385 --> 04:11:08.887
DIFFERENT AREAS OF CRISIS

04:11:08.953 --> 04:11:10.321
STABILIZATION UNITS BEING CLOSE

04:11:10.388 --> 04:11:11.756
TO. DIFFERENT MEDICAL

04:11:11.823 --> 04:11:14.259
FACILITIES- WELL WE'RE ON THE

04:11:14.325 --> 04:11:15.393
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE

04:11:15.460 --> 04:11:16.428
WORKED HARD ON CRISIS

04:11:16.494 --> 04:11:18.430
STABILIZATION UNITS. I THINK AT

04:11:18.496 --> 04:11:21.032
THAT POINT WE HAD ONE OUT AND-

04:11:21.099 --> 04:11:22.434
IN JOSHUA TREE OUT IN THE

04:11:22.500 --> 04:11:24.936
DESERT- I THINK TWELVE BEDS BUT-

04:11:25.003 --> 04:11:26.371
THE LONGEVITY OF THE STAY WAS

04:11:26.438 --> 04:11:29.641
ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT WAS- ALSO-

04:11:29.707 --> 04:11:31.609
A CONCERN. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE

04:11:31.676 --> 04:11:33.211
LACK OF RESOURCES OVER THERE

04:11:33.278 --> 04:11:34.512
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MOBILE

04:11:34.579 --> 04:11:35.814
CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS IN

04:11:35.880 --> 04:11:37.982
CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. AS

04:11:38.049 --> 04:11:40.318
AN ALTERNATIVE FOR- EMERGENCY

04:11:40.385 --> 04:11:42.654
ROOMS AND- AND WE HAVE LAW

04:11:42.720 --> 04:11:44.756
ENFORCEMENT FIREFIGHTERS MOVING

04:11:44.823 --> 04:11:45.423
YOU KNOW BEING CALLED THE

04:11:45.490 --> 04:11:48.827
SITUATION. BUT WE ALSO- WITHIN

04:11:48.893 --> 04:11:50.862
WE HEARD A PRESENTATION OF HOW.

04:11:50.929 --> 04:11:52.664
IT WAS SUCCESSFUL I FORGET WHICH

04:11:52.730 --> 04:11:55.033
PRISONER IT WAS THAT THEY HAVE A

04:11:55.099 --> 04:11:56.334
AN AREA NOW WHERE THEY HAVE

04:11:56.401 --> 04:11:58.303
SERVICES WITH OTHER HOSPITALS I

04:11:58.369 --> 04:12:03.374
GUESS. THAT WOULD THEN- HAVE-PEOPLE HAVE- PATIENTS THERE ARE-

04:12:03.441 --> 04:12:05.577
OUR CLIENTS BUT HOW LONG IS THAT

04:12:05.643 --> 04:12:06.711
IS THE STATE FOR THOSE

04:12:06.778 --> 04:12:08.680
INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO STAY.

04:12:08.746 --> 04:12:10.715
IN THOSE TYPES OF FACILITIES

04:12:10.782 --> 04:12:12.917
BECAUSE I THINK ONE OF THE NEXT

04:12:12.984 --> 04:12:14.352
STEP- CERTAINLY CRISIS

04:12:14.419 --> 04:12:15.687
STABILIZATION UNITS MOBILE

04:12:15.753 --> 04:12:18.089
CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS. BUT

04:12:18.156 --> 04:12:21.259
ALSO- THE LONG TERM NINETY DAYS

04:12:21.326 --> 04:12:23.361
PLUS TYPE OF TREATMENT I THINK

04:12:23.428 --> 04:12:25.363
WE HAVE TO. START AT LEAST THROW

04:12:25.430 --> 04:12:27.165
INTO THE DISCUSSION- IF WE'RE

04:12:27.232 --> 04:12:29.100
TALKING ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

04:12:29.167 --> 04:12:31.202
BEING BUILT OUT AND I WANT TO

04:12:31.269 --> 04:12:32.770

CHAIR BUT- ON THE DISCUSSION ON

04:12:38.476 --> 04:12:39.911
TRIBAL INCLUSION- WITH THE

04:12:39.978 --> 04:12:41.679
INFRASTRUCTURAL BUILD. THAT'S

04:12:41.746 --> 04:12:44.148
THERE BUT ALSO- MAKING SURE THAT

04:12:44.215 --> 04:12:46.351
THE AGE APPROPRIATION IS THERE

04:12:46.417 --> 04:12:49.187
ALSO FOR. OUR YOUTH- OUR OUR

04:12:49.254 --> 04:12:51.523
ADOLESCENTS IT IN OUR ADULT

04:12:51.589 --> 04:12:53.491
POPULATION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT

04:12:53.558 --> 04:12:55.527
THE PICTURE. IN FULL CIRCLE SO-

04:12:55.593 --> 04:12:57.529
COUPLE QUESTIONS AS FAR AS THE

04:12:57.595 --> 04:12:59.898
RESOURCES LEAVING- THE EMERGENCY

04:12:59.964 --> 04:13:01.466
ROOMS AT THIS POINT. WHAT

04:13:01.533 --> 04:13:05.436
RESOURCES- ARE- BEING GIVEN TO-

04:13:05.503 --> 04:13:08.039
THOSE INDIVIDUALS NEEDING THAT

04:13:08.106 --> 04:13:09.974
AND ALSO IN THOSE- WE HAVE

04:13:10.041 --> 04:13:14.178
AVAILABILITY ASIAN AREAS. WHAT

04:13:14.245 --> 04:13:18.216
IS THE LONGEVITY OF THE STATE.

04:13:18.283 --> 04:13:20.285
I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER IT FROM

04:13:20.351 --> 04:13:21.853
THE HOSPITAL PERSPECTIVE- WHEN

04:13:21.920 --> 04:13:23.288
WE STARTED OUT OUR LENGTH OF

04:13:23.354 --> 04:13:24.989
STAY IN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WAS

04:13:25.056 --> 04:13:27.659
RIGHT AROUND THIRTY TWO HOURS-

04:13:27.725 --> 04:13:29.460
FOR OUR PATIENTS. BEFORE THEY

04:13:29.527 --> 04:13:31.195
GOT PLACED IN ANOTHER FACILITY

04:13:31.262 --> 04:13:32.630
WITH OUR IMPLEMENTATION OF OUR

04:13:32.697 --> 04:13:34.232
C. ISSUE THEY GO THROUGH A

04:13:34.299 --> 04:13:36.467
MEDICAL ASSESSMENT. AND RULE OUT

04:13:36.534 --> 04:13:38.836
ANY MEDICAL CONDITION THAT THEY

04:13:38.903 --> 04:13:41.673
THEY MAY HAVE- MOST RECENTLY IN

04:13:41.739 --> 04:13:43.508
THE FALL WE'VE GOT THAT DOWN TO

04:13:43.575 --> 04:13:45.376
JUST OVER FOUR HOURS. BUT IN THE

04:13:45.443 --> 04:13:47.111
LAST FEW MONTHS WE'VE ACTUALLY

04:13:47.178 --> 04:13:49.147
GOT THAT DOWN TO UNDER THREE. ON

04:13:49.213 --> 04:13:50.481
AND SO WE'RE GETTING BETTER AT

04:13:50.548 --> 04:13:53.318
THIS TOO- MOVE PATIENTS FROM THE

04:13:53.384 --> 04:13:55.219
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT INTO. OUR

04:13:55.286 --> 04:13:57.088
CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS SO

04:13:57.155 --> 04:13:58.957
THAT THEY CAN BE TREATED IN THE

04:13:59.023 --> 04:14:02.260
RIGHT PLACE AT THE RIGHT TIME

04:14:02.327 --> 04:14:03.962
WITH THE RIGHT PROVIDERS. IN THE

04:14:04.028 --> 04:14:07.231
LONGEVITY OF STAY AT THE- CSU'S

04:14:07.298 --> 04:14:09.934
. SURE RIGHT NOW IT'S TWENTY

04:14:10.001 --> 04:14:12.570
HOURS- IT WHEN WE STARTED OUT IT

04:14:12.637 --> 04:14:14.472
WAS A LITTLE OVER TWENTY THREE

04:14:14.539 --> 04:14:15.640
SOMEONE MADE REFERENCE TO THE

04:14:15.707 --> 04:14:17.442
FACT THAT THEY HAVE TO SOME

04:14:17.508 --> 04:14:18.977
PATIENTS HAVE TO STAY LONGER

04:14:19.043 --> 04:14:20.011
THAN TWENTY THREE HOURS THAT

04:14:20.078 --> 04:14:23.481
DOES OCCUR- THAT AND HOW THEY

04:14:23.548 --> 04:14:25.083
ARE CORRECT WE CANNOT BILL FOR

04:14:25.149 --> 04:14:27.251
ANYTHING OVER. TWENTY THREE

04:14:27.318 --> 04:14:29.120
HOURS AND FIFTY NINE MINUTES-

04:14:29.187 --> 04:14:30.855
BUT WE WORK VERY HARD TO GET

04:14:30.922 --> 04:14:33.625
THAT LIKE TO STAY- INSURANCE WE

04:14:33.691 --> 04:14:37.795
CAN. THANK YOU AYE I WANNA BRING

04:14:37.862 --> 04:14:39.364
IT UP TO THE CHAIR- I WILL

04:14:39.430 --> 04:14:43.301
START- BY IDENTIFYING THE DATA

04:14:43.368 --> 04:14:45.003
POINTS THAT BOTH OF THE

04:14:45.069 --> 04:14:47.472
PHYSICIANS BROUGHT UP AND- M.

04:14:47.538 --> 04:14:49.841
PATH AS A MODEL DECREASING THE

04:14:49.907 --> 04:14:51.009
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT LENGTH OF

04:14:51.075 --> 04:14:54.312
STAY BY 70% IS SIGNIFICANT. OUR

04:14:54.379 --> 04:14:56.481
ABILITY TO DECREASED IN PATIENTS

04:14:56.547 --> 04:14:58.216
LIKE HIGH PSYCHIATRIC

04:14:58.282 --> 04:15:01.986
ADMISSIONS. BY 53% IS SIMILARLY

04:15:02.053 --> 04:15:04.989
SIGNIFICANT AS WELL AS THE

04:15:05.056 --> 04:15:07.025
IMPROVED OUTPATIENT FOLLOW UP.

04:15:07.091 --> 04:15:09.060
WILL HELP US WITH TREATMENT

04:15:09.127 --> 04:15:11.663
PLANS. THAT I REALLY WOULD AGREE

04:15:11.729 --> 04:15:13.865
WITH WHAT TV TOBY EWING SAID

04:15:13.931 --> 04:15:15.600
THAT THIS IS BOTH CREATIVE AND

04:15:15.667 --> 04:15:17.802
APPROPRIATE. AND THAT WE HAVE

04:15:17.869 --> 04:15:20.304
CAPACITY FOR US TO SCALE. I'M

04:15:20.371 --> 04:15:22.674
FOCUSED ON SUSTAINABLE ABILITY

04:15:22.740 --> 04:15:24.275
BECAUSE WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE

04:15:24.342 --> 04:15:26.077
ADMINISTRATION. IS THAT THE

04:15:26.144 --> 04:15:27.779
MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLAN SHOULD

04:15:27.845 --> 04:15:29.914
BILL FOR ALL SERVICES WHILE

04:15:29.981 --> 04:15:32.116
THEY'RE IN THE- EMERGENCY

04:15:32.183 --> 04:15:34.152
DEPARTMENT BUT THAT AS SOON AS

04:15:34.218 --> 04:15:38.956
WE TRANSFER- TO A CSU. THAT WE

04:15:39.023 --> 04:15:42.694
DON'T HAVE THAT SAME LEVEL OF-

04:15:42.760 --> 04:15:44.962
REIMBURSEMENT THAT I'D LIKE TO

04:15:45.029 --> 04:15:47.031
BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND FROM THE

04:15:47.098 --> 04:15:49.233
ADMINISTRATION. HOW WE HELP TO

04:15:49.300 --> 04:15:51.369
CREATE SUSTAINABILITY WITHIN

04:15:51.436 --> 04:15:56.541
THIS MODEL WHILE THE- INNOVATION

04:15:56.607 --> 04:15:59.177
DOLLARS MAY HELP US TO CREATE

04:15:59.243 --> 04:16:01.612
THE SPACE IT REALLY WILL BE THE

04:16:01.679 --> 04:16:04.315
BILLING LONG TERM. THAT CREATES

04:16:04.382 --> 04:16:06.551
THE SUSTAINABILITY THAT I'D LIKE

04:16:06.617 --> 04:16:09.287
TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOU- WHERE

04:16:09.353 --> 04:16:10.888
THERE ARE DIFFICULTIES RIGHT

04:16:10.955 --> 04:16:14.158
NOW- WITH THE CSU MODEL IN TERMS

04:16:14.225 --> 04:16:16.327
OF CREATING THAT LONG TERM

04:16:16.394 --> 04:16:18.796
SUSTAINABILITY. YOUR HAPPY TO

04:16:18.863 --> 04:16:20.865
RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION SO YOU

04:16:20.932 --> 04:16:22.800
THINK YOU KNOW THE MODELS TALKED

04:16:22.867 --> 04:16:25.970
ABOUT TODAY ON THIS HEARING- ARE

04:16:26.037 --> 04:16:28.039
ARE REALLY GOOD RIGHT IN REGARDS

04:16:28.106 --> 04:16:29.607
TO IDENTIFYING ASSESSING IF IT'S

04:16:29.674 --> 04:16:31.309
AN EMERGENCY OR NOT AND IF IT IS

04:16:31.375 --> 04:16:33.277
NOT A CURRENT EMERGENCY

04:16:33.344 --> 04:16:34.045
TRANSFERRED TO THE APPROPRIATE

04:16:34.112 --> 04:16:36.047
LEVEL OF SERVICE LIKE A CRISIS

04:16:36.114 --> 04:16:38.616
STABILIZATION UNIT- AND WHAT WAS

04:16:38.683 --> 04:16:40.551
STATED. OF PREVIOUSLY IS CORRECT

04:16:40.618 --> 04:16:42.286
UNDER FEDERAL LAW SOMEONE IS NOT

04:16:42.353 --> 04:16:44.489
ALLOWED TO STAY IN A CRISIS

04:16:44.555 --> 04:16:45.790
STABILIZATION UNIT FOR MORE THAN

04:16:45.857 --> 04:16:47.391
THAT ARE LESS THAN TWENTY FOUR

04:16:47.458 --> 04:16:49.227
HOURS THAT I'D SAY SO TWENTY

04:16:49.293 --> 04:16:50.495
THREE HOURS FIFTY. NINE SECONDS

04:16:50.561 --> 04:16:52.163
THAT ARE MINUTES AS I MENTIONED

04:16:52.230 --> 04:16:53.998
IS CORRECT IT REALLY AT THE END

04:16:54.065 --> 04:16:56.267
OF THE DAY- IF YOU HAVE A FULL

04:16:56.334 --> 04:16:59.036
CONTINUUM OF CARE- WITH ACCESS

04:16:59.103 --> 04:17:00.438
TO OUTPATIENT AND RESIDENTIAL

04:17:00.505 --> 04:17:01.839
SERVICES FOR APPROPRIATE

04:17:01.906 --> 04:17:03.775
PLACEMENT ACROSS THE STATE OF

04:17:03.841 --> 04:17:04.842
CALIFORNIA- IT WOULD BE

04:17:04.909 --> 04:17:06.644
REASONABLE TO ASSUME SOMEONE IN

04:17:06.711 --> 04:17:08.679
A CRISIS STABILIZATION UNIT.

04:17:08.746 --> 04:17:10.815
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BE TRANSFERRED

04:17:10.882 --> 04:17:13.417
FOR PLACEMENT- IN VARIOUS OTHER

04:17:13.484 --> 04:17:14.886
OUTPATIENT SETTINGS OR

04:17:14.952 --> 04:17:16.554
RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS OR

04:17:16.621 --> 04:17:17.688
INPATIENT DEPENDING ON WHAT'S

04:17:17.755 --> 04:17:20.224
NEEDED BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT-

04:17:20.291 --> 04:17:22.593
BY THE CLINICAL STAFF BEING ABLE

04:17:22.660 --> 04:17:25.062
TO TRANSFER THOSE INDIVIDUALS

04:17:25.129 --> 04:17:27.799
AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE

04:17:27.865 --> 04:17:28.800
TRYING TO ACHIEVE WITH THAT. CAN

04:17:28.866 --> 04:17:30.301

CRAZY CRISIS STABILIZATION UNITS

04:17:34.539 --> 04:17:37.408
BUT ALSO. MORE OUTPATIENT MORE

04:17:37.475 --> 04:17:39.410
RESIDENTIAL MORE IMPATIENT WHEN

04:17:39.477 --> 04:17:41.345
NEEDED THAT IS WHERE WE HAVE

04:17:41.412 --> 04:17:43.181

AND IF WE LOOK AT PAGE FORTY

04:43:29.859 --> 04:43:31.894
THREE OF THE AGENDA. WE SEE FROM

04:43:31.961 --> 04:43:34.464
THE CDC THAT MORE THAN A HUNDRED

04:43:34.530 --> 04:43:36.332
THOUSAND PEOPLE DIED. OF DRUG

04:43:36.399 --> 04:43:38.768

TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO THE FIRST.

04:43:43.639 --> 04:43:46.442

04:43:49.912 --> 04:43:51.981
ONE YEAR BEFORE. AND IT'S AWFUL

04:43:52.048 --> 04:43:54.050
DOUBLING OVER THE PAST FIVE

04:43:54.117 --> 04:43:56.819
YEARS. AND WHAT WE SAW FROM THAT

04:43:56.886 --> 04:44:00.089
WAS THAT FENTANYL ACCOUNTED 464%

04:44:00.156 --> 04:44:02.525
OF ALL OF THOSE DRUG. OVERDOSE

04:44:02.592 --> 04:44:04.127

05:00:30.212 --> 05:00:31.847
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE PART OF

05:00:31.913 --> 05:00:34.383
THAT SYSTEM. MENTAL HEALTH PEERS

05:00:34.449 --> 05:00:36.318
AND CLIENTS FAMILY MEMBERS

05:00:36.385 --> 05:00:38.353
PROVIDERS AND OTHERS TO REALLY

05:00:38.420 --> 05:00:41.957
BE PART OF THE- THE WAY IN WHICH

05:00:42.023 --> 05:00:42.858
THE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED WITHIN

05:00:42.924 --> 05:00:44.626
FORWARD. THE COMMISSION'S WORK

05:00:44.693 --> 05:00:46.495
IS REALLY DESIGNED TO PROVIDE

05:00:46.561 --> 05:00:47.863
WHAT WE MIGHT CALL INFORMED

05:00:47.929 --> 05:00:49.364
CONSENT OF THAT PROCESS THE

05:00:49.431 --> 05:00:50.866
COMMISSION HAS BEEN WORKING IN

05:00:50.932 --> 05:00:52.701
THREE PRIMARY AREAS THE FIRST IS

05:00:52.768 --> 05:00:55.537
FINANCING. THE LAW REQUIRES

05:00:55.604 --> 05:00:56.505
COUNTIES TO ENGAGE MENTAL

05:00:56.571 --> 05:00:58.140
HEALTH. THE MENTAL HEALTH

05:00:58.206 --> 05:00:59.474
COMMUNITY AROUND HOW TO SPEND

05:00:59.541 --> 05:01:01.576
FUNDING AND SO WE BELIEVE IT'S

05:01:01.643 --> 05:01:02.744
IMPORTANT TO KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY

05:01:02.811 --> 05:01:04.546
IS AVAILABLE SO THAT THOSE THOSE

05:01:04.613 --> 05:01:06.548
DECISIONS CAN BE INFORMED. BY

05:01:06.615 --> 05:01:08.683
THAT INFORMATION SECOND WE THINK

05:01:08.750 --> 05:01:09.985
IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE COMMUNITY

05:01:10.051 --> 05:01:11.520
TO UNDERSTAND THE KINDS OF

05:01:11.586 --> 05:01:12.954
PROGRAMS THAT ARE IN PLACE

05:01:13.021 --> 05:01:14.022
AROUND THE STATE THAT'S VERY

05:01:14.089 --> 05:01:15.056
DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF THE

05:01:15.123 --> 05:01:18.693
DIVERSITY OF STRATEGIES IN PLACE

05:01:18.760 --> 05:01:19.494
ACROSS THE COUNTIES. ALL OF THAT

05:01:19.561 --> 05:01:21.363
WERE TAKES EXAMPLE THE EMPATHIC

05:01:21.430 --> 05:01:22.964
MODEL IS UNDERSTANDING THAT IF

05:01:23.031 --> 05:01:23.832
WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE

05:01:23.899 --> 05:01:25.600
INTERVENTION WHERE IS IT IN

05:01:25.667 --> 05:01:27.302
PLACE SOMEWHERE ISN'T IT IN

05:01:27.369 --> 05:01:28.670
PLACE. AND HOW MIGHT WE ENGAGE

05:01:28.737 --> 05:01:30.338
THE COMMUNITY TO WORK WITH THE

05:01:30.405 --> 05:01:32.107
COUNTY PARTNERS AND OTHERS WHO

05:01:32.174 --> 05:01:33.108
ARE INVOLVED IN COMMUNITY MENTAL

05:01:33.175 --> 05:01:34.443
HEALTH SYSTEM. TO REALLY PUT IN

05:01:34.509 --> 05:01:36.378
PLACE THE PROGRAMS THAT WILL BE

05:01:36.445 --> 05:01:37.412
RESPONSIVE TO NEEDS. AND THE

05:01:37.479 --> 05:01:38.713
THIRD ISSUE IS THE MOST

05:01:38.780 --> 05:01:40.115
IMPORTANT ISSUE IS OUTCOMES AND

05:01:40.182 --> 05:01:42.417
SO WE WORK WITH THE H. YES TO

05:01:42.484 --> 05:01:44.319
WORK THERE CAN BE FOR HEALTH.

05:01:44.386 --> 05:01:45.487

HEALTH. TO SEE IF WE CAN

05:01:55.931 --> 05:01:57.399
IDENTIFY CORE METRICS THAT CAN

05:01:57.466 --> 05:01:58.567
INFORM THESE DECISIONS OVER

05:01:58.633 --> 05:02:00.602
TIME. THE GOAL IS REALLY TO A

05:02:00.669 --> 05:02:01.970
QUICK POLICYMAKERS AND THE

05:02:02.037 --> 05:02:03.505

HEALTH SYSTEM THEY HAVE TODAY.

05:02:05.340 --> 05:02:07.175
TO MAKE GOOD EVALUATED DECISIONS

05:02:07.242 --> 05:02:08.810
IF THEY'RE HAPPY WITH THE KINDS

05:02:08.877 --> 05:02:10.111

FOR THE FUNDING AND THE EFFORT

05:02:11.580 --> 05:02:13.114

TRANSFORMATIONAL CHANGE AND PART

05:02:18.053 --> 05:02:19.855
OF THAT IS BEING HONEST ABOUT

05:02:19.921 --> 05:02:21.623
WHAT WE CAN DO WITH THE FUNDING

05:02:21.690 --> 05:02:22.457
WE HAVE. WHERE WE MAY NEED

05:02:22.524 --> 05:02:24.426
ADDITIONAL RESOURCES HOW WE CAN

05:02:24.493 --> 05:02:26.561

05:07:09.110 --> 05:07:10.779
COUNTIES ARE NOT REPORTING THE

05:07:10.845 --> 05:07:12.347
INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN USE

05:07:12.413 --> 05:07:14.983
THIS FISCAL TANSPARENCY TOOL

05:07:15.049 --> 05:07:16.985
WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE

05:07:17.051 --> 05:07:21.523
EXPECTATION. WHEN WILL WE BE

05:07:21.589 --> 05:07:22.724
ABLE TO HAVE THIS FISCAL

05:07:22.791 --> 05:07:26.361
TRANSPARENCY. I THINK I MAY NOT

05:07:26.427 --> 05:07:28.096
BE UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION

05:07:28.163 --> 05:07:30.098
BECAUSE COUNTIES ARE REPORTING

05:07:30.165 --> 05:07:32.200
I'M ALL OF THE INFORMATION THEY

05:07:32.267 --> 05:07:33.668

UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT IT IS

05:07:46.915 --> 05:07:48.583
I THINK I MADE A MISTAKE COUNTY

COMMITTEE STAFF WE REPORTED THAT

05:07:59.961 --> 05:08:02.530
WE HAD. A VERY SMALL NUMBER OF

05:08:02.597 --> 05:08:04.399
COUNTY REPORT SO THE DATA COME

05:08:04.465 --> 05:08:05.266

FILE AND THEN IT COMES TO US. WE

05:08:11.339 --> 05:08:13.241
HAVE BEEN GETTING QUESTIONS FROM

05:08:13.308 --> 05:08:15.543
THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS ABOUT

05:08:15.610 --> 05:08:17.345
THE FUND BALANCES THAT COUNTIES

05:08:17.412 --> 05:08:19.848

REVENUES THAT ARE COMING IN. AND

05:08:29.924 --> 05:08:31.292
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS THAT

05:08:31.359 --> 05:08:32.861
REVENUES THIS YEAR I SHOULD SAY

05:08:32.927 --> 05:08:34.028
LAST YEAR EXCEEDED THE PRIOR

YEAR AND THIS YEAR THEY'RE

05:08:35.496 --> 05:08:37.465
EXCEEDING LAST YEAR. AND THAT

05:08:37.532 --> 05:08:39.968
THE VAST BULK OF THOSE FUNDS

05:08:40.034 --> 05:08:42.904
COME IN AT THE BEGINNING OF THE

05:08:42.971 --> 05:08:43.938
FISCAL YEAR. ENDED AT THE SAME

05:08:44.005 --> 05:08:45.974
TIME WE'VE BEEN HEARING FROM

05:08:46.040 --> 05:08:47.375
PROVIDERS AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS

05:08:47.442 --> 05:08:49.477
OF CONCERNS THAT IS THEY WORK

05:08:49.544 --> 05:08:50.612
WITH THEIR COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

HEALTH PARTNERS TO TRY TO ACCESS

05:08:52.647 --> 05:08:54.315
THESE ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO EXPAND

05:08:54.382 --> 05:08:56.384
ACCESS TO CARE BECAUSE OF THE

05:08:56.451 --> 05:08:57.252
KINDS OF CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE

05:08:57.318 --> 05:08:59.320

REALLY TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

05:09:08.930 --> 05:09:10.999
HAPPENED LAST YEAR AND HOW CAN

05:09:11.065 --> 05:09:11.966
WE UPDATE THE FISCAL

05:09:12.033 --> 05:09:13.668
TRANSPARENCY TOOL. AT THE TIME

05:09:13.735 --> 05:09:14.802

STAFF WE HAD ONLY RECEIVED ABOUT

05:09:18.373 --> 05:09:20.241
TEN COUNTY REPORTS SUBSEQUENT TO

05:09:20.308 --> 05:09:26.381
THAT WHICH. WAS A COUPLE OF

05:09:26.447 --> 05:09:27.148
WEEKS AGO THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH

05:09:27.215 --> 05:09:29.450
SERVICES HAS- HAS SENT US A- OUR

05:09:29.517 --> 05:09:30.051
THIRTY NINE. COUNTY BEHAVIORAL

05:09:30.118 --> 05:09:31.185
HEALTH REPORTS SO MUCH I THINK

05:09:31.252 --> 05:09:33.221
YOU KNOW BOTH REALITIES ARE TRUE

05:09:33.288 --> 05:09:35.490
IN THAT WE DID AT THE TIME THAT

05:09:35.556 --> 05:09:37.025
WE WORK WITH YOUR STAFF. FOR

05:09:37.091 --> 05:09:38.426
THIS COMMITTEE THERE WERE SOME

05:09:38.493 --> 05:09:41.329
DELAYS. AND ES DE PRODUCTOR 5%

05:09:41.396 --> 05:09:43.364
AS THE COUNTIES HAVE IMPROVE THE

05:09:43.431 --> 05:09:45.733
REPORTING H. U. S. HAS HAS

05:09:45.800 --> 05:09:47.101
REALLY TRIED TO STREAMLINE THIS

05:09:47.168 --> 05:09:49.304
PROCESS WE'RE IN PRIOR YEARS WE

05:09:49.370 --> 05:09:52.006
SAW- DELAYS THAT MIGHT HAVE

05:09:52.073 --> 05:09:54.142
LASTED A YEAR OR LONGER WE'RE

05:09:54.208 --> 05:09:55.877
SEEING. A MUCH QUICKER

05:09:55.944 --> 05:09:57.812
TURNAROUND. HOWEVER TO THIS AS

05:09:57.879 --> 05:10:00.315
OF TODAY AND WE DO NOT HAVE A

05:10:00.381 --> 05:10:02.450
CLEAR UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT FUND

05:10:02.517 --> 05:10:04.452
BALANCES ARE. AT THE END OF LAST

05:10:04.519 --> 05:10:07.989
YEAR. THE COMMISSION WILL EARN

05:10:08.056 --> 05:10:10.458
GENEROUS. OKAY THANK COMMISSION

WILL HOLD A HEARING ON THIS

05:10:12.226 --> 05:10:14.829
ISSUE ON AS PART OF OUR MARCH

05:10:14.896 --> 05:10:16.264
TWENTY FOURTH. PUBLIC HEARING

05:10:16.331 --> 05:10:18.066
THE COMMISSION WILL WILL RECEIVE

05:10:18.132 --> 05:10:20.868
A PRESENTATION FROM ME ON THE

05:10:20.935 --> 05:10:21.836
FISCAL TRANSPARENCY TOOL IN ITS

05:10:21.903 --> 05:10:23.471
STATUS- THERE IS SOME

05:10:23.538 --> 05:10:24.772
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE

05:10:24.839 --> 05:10:27.308
COMMISSION AT THIS POINT AND C.

05:10:27.375 --> 05:10:29.277
B. H. D. A. AND SO THAT THAT'S

05:10:29.344 --> 05:10:30.445
THOSE ARE THE ISSUES THAT WE

05:10:30.511 --> 05:10:32.680
WANT TO ERROR DURING THAT

05:10:32.747 --> 05:10:33.881
MEETING ON THE TWENTY FOURTH.

05:10:33.948 --> 05:10:35.650
AND IT REALLY GETS THAT- KNOW

05:10:35.717 --> 05:10:37.251
HOW TO MOST APPROPRIATELY

05:10:37.318 --> 05:10:40.254
COMMUNICATE WITH THE PUBLIC

05:10:40.321 --> 05:10:42.123
ABOUT THE FUND BALANCES THE

05:10:42.190 --> 05:10:44.025
COUNTIES MAINTAIN WE DON'T

05:10:44.092 --> 05:10:46.027
DISPUTE THE COMMENTS OF DH

05:10:46.094 --> 05:10:48.930
YASSER CVH TA THAT MOST COUNTIES

05:10:48.997 --> 05:10:51.132
DO SPEND THEIR FUNDS WITHIN THE

05:10:51.199 --> 05:10:52.467
THREE OR THE FIVE YEAR TIME

05:10:52.533 --> 05:10:54.369
FRAME. THAT'S NOT IN DISPUTE

05:10:54.435 --> 05:10:55.937
WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS WIDE

05:10:56.004 --> 05:10:58.439
VARIATION IN HOW QUICKLY COUNTY

05:10:58.506 --> 05:11:00.575
SPEND THOSE DOLLARS AND CONCERNS

05:11:00.641 --> 05:11:02.076
IN THE COMMUNITY THAT COUNTIES

05:11:02.143 --> 05:11:03.644
THAT ARE RETAINING LARGE FUND

05:11:03.711 --> 05:11:06.514
BALANCES COULD USE THOSE FUNDS

05:11:06.581 --> 05:11:08.316
TO RESPOND TO THE VERY URGENT

05:11:08.383 --> 05:11:09.417
NEEDS IN THE COMMUNITY THAT

05:11:09.484 --> 05:11:11.352
THAT. THAT THE PEOPLE ARE

05:11:11.419 --> 05:11:13.421
CONCERNED ABOUT TODAY IS I THINK

05:11:13.488 --> 05:11:15.790
THE ISSUE OVER ACCESS TO DATA IS

05:11:15.857 --> 05:11:16.991
GETTING DRAMATICALLY BETTER AND

05:11:17.058 --> 05:11:19.260
WE MAY HAVE CAUGHT UP- I HAVEN'T

05:11:19.327 --> 05:11:20.795
CHECKED IN WITH MY STAFF TODAY

05:11:20.862 --> 05:11:23.031
BUT I KNOW DHS HAS BEEN WORKING

05:11:23.097 --> 05:11:24.565
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

05:11:24.632 --> 05:11:27.068
MOST UPDATED INFORMATION- BUT

05:11:27.135 --> 05:11:29.237
THERE ARE DISAGREEMENTS OVER.

05:11:29.303 --> 05:11:30.905
THE EXTENT THAT THE COMMISSION

05:11:30.972 --> 05:11:32.473
SHOULD BE RELEASING INFORMATION

05:11:32.540 --> 05:11:34.876
ON AND FENCE FUND FUND BALANCES

05:11:34.942 --> 05:11:37.011
AS IT COULD BE MISINTERPRETED BY

05:11:37.078 --> 05:11:39.747
THE PUBLIC THAT THOSE FUNDS ARE

05:11:39.814 --> 05:11:42.150
NOT. PLANNED FOR FUTURE

05:11:42.216 --> 05:11:44.552
EXPENDITURES AGAIN OUR CONCERN

05:11:44.619 --> 05:11:47.522
IS THE TENSION BETWEEN PLANNING

05:11:47.588 --> 05:11:48.823
FOR FUTURE EXPENDITURES AND

05:11:48.890 --> 05:11:50.124
ADDRESSING THE VERY URGENT

05:11:50.191 --> 05:11:53.961
CRISES THAT. WE'RE SEEING ACROSS

05:11:54.028 --> 05:11:55.329
OUR COMMUNITIES AT THE MOMENT.

05:11:55.396 --> 05:11:56.297
THANK YOU THANK YOU AND IF I

05:11:56.364 --> 05:11:57.999
COULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO

05:11:58.066 --> 05:11:59.200
RESPOND NOW THAT I BETTER

05:11:59.267 --> 05:12:00.301
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE I THINK THE

05:12:00.368 --> 05:12:02.303
REASON I WAS CONFUSED BECAUSE

05:12:02.370 --> 05:12:03.738
THE VAST MAJORITY OF COUNTIES

05:12:03.805 --> 05:12:04.639
HAD TURNED. THEIR EXPENSES WE

05:12:04.705 --> 05:12:05.373
PASSED THE MON DAMAGES SAYING

05:12:05.440 --> 05:12:07.608
I'M TO THE L. A. C. WE WORK

05:12:07.675 --> 05:12:08.476
TOGETHER REGULARLY ON THE

05:12:08.543 --> 05:12:10.044
TRANSPARENCY TOOL THAT.

05:12:10.111 --> 05:12:11.112
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE YES IN

05:12:11.179 --> 05:12:13.147
THE L. A. P. ON THE TRANSPARENCY

05:12:13.214 --> 05:12:14.482
TO ALL I THINK ARE QUITE MINOR

05:12:14.549 --> 05:12:16.217
AND AT THIS POINT TECHNICAL I

05:12:16.284 --> 05:12:17.585
THINK THE ONE ISSUE THAT SHALL

05:12:17.652 --> 05:12:20.088
BE RAISED AS WE- ARGUE ONE OF

05:12:20.154 --> 05:12:23.491
FLAG IS THAT- WE ARE. COMMITTED

05:12:23.558 --> 05:12:25.693
TO MAKING SURE THAT THE ALLIES

05:12:25.760 --> 05:12:27.161
FOLLOWED IN THE COUNTY G. USING

05:12:27.228 --> 05:12:28.763
THE FUNDS AND APPROPRIATELY

05:12:28.830 --> 05:12:30.264
WHICH MEANS THAT MANY OF THESE

05:12:30.331 --> 05:12:34.102
BONDS ARE LOCKED INTO. PLANNING-PROCESSES THAT CAN TAKE A YEAR

05:12:34.168 --> 05:12:36.938
TO DO AND THAT WE- AND THAT WE

05:12:37.004 --> 05:12:38.372
ARE NOT AT LIBERTY TO TELL

05:12:38.439 --> 05:12:40.408
COUNTIES HOW TO USE THAT FUNDING

05:12:40.475 --> 05:12:41.109
OUTSIDE OF LOCAL PLANNING

05:12:41.175 --> 05:12:43.044
PROCESS AND SO WILD. AND I'M

05:12:43.111 --> 05:12:44.779
SPEND FUND BALANCE COULD LOOK

05:12:44.846 --> 05:12:47.181
ALARMING IN REALITY ALL OF THAT

05:12:47.248 --> 05:12:48.483
FUNDING COULD BE ALLOCATED

05:12:48.549 --> 05:12:51.486
CONTRACTED ENCUMBERED AND USED

05:12:51.552 --> 05:12:52.353
FOR PRIORITIES THAT HAVE

05:12:52.420 --> 05:12:54.856
INDETERMINATE LOCALLY. AND COULD

05:12:54.922 --> 05:12:57.091
BE SPENT AB ACCORDING TO THE NHS

05:12:57.158 --> 05:12:58.793
A PRIORITIES AS I MENTIONED

05:12:58.860 --> 05:13:00.328
BEFORE WITHIN THREE YEARS THE

05:13:00.394 --> 05:13:02.096
LARGER COUNTIES IN FIVE YEARS

05:13:02.163 --> 05:13:03.297
FOR THE FOLLOWING COUNTIES. AND

05:13:03.364 --> 05:13:05.266
WE HAVE SEEN- WHEN WE LOOK AT

05:13:05.333 --> 05:13:07.435
THE DATA THAT THE VAST MAJORITY

05:13:07.502 --> 05:13:09.337
OF AN HSA FUNDS IS BEING SPENT

05:13:09.403 --> 05:13:20.381
VERY EARLY ON. AND WE ARE SEEING. THAT KIND OF PROBLEMS WE DID

05:13:20.448 --> 05:13:22.016
SEVERAL YEARS AGO. WHAT A PLEASE

05:13:22.083 --> 05:13:23.484
THE ARE. TO THE FOLLOW AND FOR

05:13:23.551 --> 05:13:25.386
THE- AS WELL TO HAVE THE-

05:13:25.453 --> 05:13:27.054
TURNED. AS WE FOR ALL DAY ABOUT

05:13:27.121 --> 05:13:28.189
THE NEED FOR US TO MAKE

05:13:28.256 --> 05:13:29.190
APPROPRIATE INVESTMENTS AND- IF

05:13:29.257 --> 05:13:30.958
COUNTIES ARE SITTING ON LARGE

05:13:31.025 --> 05:13:33.060
RESERVES. I BELIEVE MANY OF US

05:13:33.127 --> 05:13:36.297
WOULD LIKE TO ASK. TO SEE IF WE

05:13:36.364 --> 05:13:37.765
CAN WORK ON FASTER TIMELINES TO

05:13:37.832 --> 05:13:39.567
ADDRESS THE CRISES. THAT WE HAVE

05:13:39.634 --> 05:13:43.004
BEFORE US. THAT I'D LIKE TO TURN

05:13:43.070 --> 05:13:44.505
TO A QUESTION AND BE ABLE TO

05:13:44.572 --> 05:13:48.442
ASK- DR KELLY IF I COULD. IT IT

05:13:48.509 --> 05:13:50.211
SEEMS FROM WHAT YOU WERE SAYING

05:13:50.278 --> 05:13:51.812
YOU MADE A VERY COMPELLING

05:13:51.879 --> 05:13:54.949
ARGUMENT TO. FOCUS ON KEEPING IT

05:13:55.016 --> 05:13:58.085
LOCAL SO WE COULD WORK WITH

05:13:58.152 --> 05:13:59.453
EQUITY. THAT I'D LIKE TO

05:13:59.520 --> 05:14:03.357
UNDERSTAND IF YOU BELIEVE- BASED

05:14:03.424 --> 05:14:06.294
ON WHAT YOUR TESTIMONY IS TODAY

05:14:06.360 --> 05:14:07.428
WHETHER OR NOT THOSE ARE THERE

05:14:07.495 --> 05:14:11.032
ARE THOSE LARGE RESERVES AND- IN

05:14:11.098 --> 05:14:12.400
LIGHT OF THE FACT THAT WE JUST

05:14:12.466 --> 05:14:14.602
WENT THROUGH A PANDEMIC OR

05:14:14.669 --> 05:14:16.370
ANECDOTALLY WE'RE HEARING. ABOUT

05:14:16.437 --> 05:14:18.539
SPENDING DECLINING DURING THIS

05:14:18.606 --> 05:14:20.775
CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND THE

05:14:20.841 --> 05:14:23.044
LIGHT OF. US HAVING INCREASED

05:14:23.110 --> 05:14:25.680
REVENUES. ARE ALL FUNDS

05:14:25.746 --> 05:14:28.015
CURRENTLY ENCUMBERED OR WILL

05:14:28.082 --> 05:14:31.319
THERE BE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT.

05:14:31.385 --> 05:14:34.322
FOR US TO HAVE DISCUSSIONS WITH

05:14:34.388 --> 05:14:35.723
TO HELP TO DETERMINE HOW TO

05:14:35.790 --> 05:14:38.125
SPEND THAT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE

05:14:38.192 --> 05:14:39.760
YOUR OPINION ON THAT. THANK YOU-

05:14:39.827 --> 05:14:43.798
DOCTOR ON BLACK. AND SO. THAT

05:14:43.864 --> 05:14:45.633
THE DIFFICULTY IN ANSWERING THAT

05:14:45.700 --> 05:14:47.235
IS THAT I KNOW THAT MY BUDGET I

05:14:47.301 --> 05:14:49.136
KNOW HOW IT IS BUDGETED I KNOW

05:14:49.203 --> 05:14:50.938
HOW IT'S ALLOCATED I KNOW HOW

05:14:51.005 --> 05:14:52.440
THAT WE WILL ENCUMBER AT ALL

05:14:52.506 --> 05:14:54.342
THAT IT WILL GO FORWARD. I CAN'T

05:14:54.408 --> 05:14:58.679
SPEAK TO EVERY COUNTY AND EVERY-COUNTIES PROCESS AS YOU KNOW IS

05:14:58.746 --> 05:14:59.347
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THE THING

05:14:59.413 --> 05:15:01.249
THAT MAKES IT HARDER FOR US IS

05:15:01.315 --> 05:15:03.117
THAT DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAD

05:15:03.184 --> 05:15:04.385
THE FUNDING OUT FOR OUR

05:15:04.452 --> 05:15:07.488
PROVIDERS BUT- WE WEREN'T ABLE

05:15:07.555 --> 05:15:09.123
TO DO ALL OF THE SERVICES WE

05:15:09.190 --> 05:15:11.192
NEEDED TO DO WE SHIFT INTO DOING

05:15:11.259 --> 05:15:12.660
TELEHEALTH WE WEREN'T DOING THE

05:15:12.727 --> 05:15:14.795
FULL ARRAY OF SERVICES BECAUSE

05:15:14.862 --> 05:15:16.564
WE WERE ON LOCKDOWN. AND THAT'S

05:15:16.631 --> 05:15:18.232
STILL SORT OF REMAINS SO THERE'S

05:15:18.299 --> 05:15:20.301
THAT IN ADDITION TO OUR WORK

05:15:20.368 --> 05:15:22.236
FORCE AND I'M NOT SAYING THIS TO

05:15:22.303 --> 05:15:23.671
BE FLIPPANT I AM SAYING IT

05:15:23.738 --> 05:15:25.973
BECAUSE IT'S TRUE THAT- OUR WORK

05:15:26.040 --> 05:15:27.742
FORCE NOT ONLY HAS IT SHIFTED

05:15:27.808 --> 05:15:29.510
BACK SOME OF OUR WORK FORCE

05:15:29.577 --> 05:15:31.746
DIED. AND SO THAT CHANGES THINGS

05:15:31.812 --> 05:15:33.914
THAT CHANGES THE WAY WE- GET

05:15:33.981 --> 05:15:36.117
SERVICES OUT ON THE STREETS AND

05:15:36.183 --> 05:15:37.985
WHEN I WAS AND- SIMPLY NOT

05:15:38.052 --> 05:15:40.655
COUNTY FOR ABOUT. THREE MONTHS I

05:15:40.721 --> 05:15:42.223
COULDN'T DO ANYTHING WITH MY

05:15:42.290 --> 05:15:43.224
CONTRACTS BECAUSE EVERYONE OF MY

05:15:43.291 --> 05:15:45.092
CONTRACT STAFF WERE OUT IN A

05:15:45.159 --> 05:15:47.128
ROTATING BASIS MANY ARE AND

05:15:47.194 --> 05:15:50.498
THEN. I ON ON VENTILATORS

05:15:50.564 --> 05:15:52.199
BECAUSE OF BECAUSE OF IT SO I

05:15:52.266 --> 05:15:54.168
WOULD LIKE FOR US JUST TO THINK

05:15:54.235 --> 05:15:56.537
ABOUT THAT WE ARE NOT JUST THE

05:15:56.604 --> 05:15:57.905
PROVIDERS OF SERVICE ALL OF US

05:15:57.972 --> 05:15:59.373
BUT WE ARE ALSO PEOPLE WHO BEEN

05:15:59.440 --> 05:16:01.108
EXPERIENCING THE VERY SAME THING

05:16:01.175 --> 05:16:03.110
THAT ALL OF US HAVE BEEN

05:16:03.177 --> 05:16:04.345
EXPERIENCING. AND SO THAT HAS

05:16:04.412 --> 05:16:06.047
SLOWED DOWN THINGS DO I THINK

05:16:06.113 --> 05:16:07.248
WILL BE UP AND RUNNING

05:16:07.315 --> 05:16:09.150
ABSOLUTELY DO I THINK THAT OUR

05:16:09.216 --> 05:16:11.152
FUNDS WILL BE ENCUMBERED

05:16:11.218 --> 05:16:12.453
ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT THERE

05:16:12.520 --> 05:16:15.690
ARE ALSO TO BE REAL- COUNTIES

05:16:15.756 --> 05:16:17.191
THAT DON'T HAVE THE WORKFORCE

05:16:17.258 --> 05:16:19.160
THEY SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THEM. I

05:16:19.226 --> 05:16:21.228
KNOW THAT YOU KNOW I HAD LASTING

05:16:21.295 --> 05:16:22.163
SAMBAR DINO COUNTY FIVE

05:16:22.229 --> 05:16:23.798
EMPLOYEES WHO DIED OF KOBE. AND

05:16:23.864 --> 05:16:26.801
I DON'T KNOW IF I WERE IN

05:16:26.867 --> 05:16:28.769
SISKIYOU FIVE EMPLOYEES WOULD BE

05:16:28.836 --> 05:16:30.004
EVERYBODY. SO I THINK THAT'S

05:16:30.071 --> 05:16:31.205
REALLY IMPORTANT TO KEEP IT IN

05:16:31.272 --> 05:16:34.975
THE CONTEXT OUR GOAL IS TO GET

05:16:35.042 --> 05:16:40.114
SERVICES OUT ON THE STREET. WE

05:16:40.181 --> 05:16:41.215
DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO TRY

05:16:41.282 --> 05:16:43.150
THREE PEOPLE AND UNFORTUNATELY.

05:16:43.217 --> 05:16:44.552
WE ARE HAND BY A BUREAUCRATIC

05:16:44.618 --> 05:16:46.554
SYSTEMS. HEY I CAN SAY THAT I

05:16:46.620 --> 05:16:48.022
THINK KNOWING THAT EVERYONE HAS

05:16:48.089 --> 05:16:48.589
A BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO

05:16:48.656 --> 05:16:49.724
APPROVE OR DON'TAPPROVE. OUR

05:16:49.790 --> 05:16:51.425
CONTRACTS AND HOW THEY MOVE. AND

05:16:51.492 --> 05:16:53.160
SO THAT IS DIFFICULT FOR US TO

05:16:53.227 --> 05:16:55.062
MANAGE BUT WE ARE ALL TRYING

05:16:55.129 --> 05:16:57.365
AGAIN WE ALL WANT. TO HEAR OUR

05:16:57.431 --> 05:16:59.100
STAKEHOLDERS AND GET THE FUNDS

05:16:59.166 --> 05:17:01.435
OUT THE DOOR TO THEM. KNOWING

05:17:01.502 --> 05:17:03.671
THAT WE HAVE THIS HUGE CHALLENGE

05:17:03.738 --> 05:17:05.172
OF HOW WE DO BUSINESS AS A

05:17:05.239 --> 05:17:07.775
COUNTY AS A GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY.

05:17:07.842 --> 05:17:10.678
AND THAT'S NOT REAL. FLEXIBLE

05:17:10.745 --> 05:17:11.946
FOR COMMUNITY PROVIDERS AND SO

05:17:12.012 --> 05:17:13.848
WE WENT WE MAKE VERY GOOD USE OF

05:17:13.914 --> 05:17:15.383
AN HSA DOLLARS SO THAT WE CAN

05:17:15.449 --> 05:17:18.919
GET IT OUT IN A WAY THAT'S VERY

05:17:18.986 --> 05:17:19.587
DIFFERENT THAN OUR MEDICAL SIDE

05:17:19.653 --> 05:17:20.421
OF THE HOUSE. BUT MY OPINION IS

05:17:20.488 --> 05:17:22.723
YES I DON'T THINK WE ARE SITTING

05:17:22.790 --> 05:17:25.393
ON A BIG DOLLARS. I WHAT I DO

05:17:25.459 --> 05:17:26.460
THINK IS THAT IT IS HARD TO

05:17:26.527 --> 05:17:28.195
UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM IT'S HARD

05:17:28.262 --> 05:17:30.164
FOR US TO UNDERSTAND OUR SYSTEM

05:17:30.231 --> 05:17:31.732
SO. TO DIRECTOR EWING'S POINT

05:17:31.799 --> 05:17:33.134
AND THAT THE TRANSPARENCY

05:17:33.200 --> 05:17:34.769
DASHBOARD WHICH WHICH WE ARE

05:17:34.835 --> 05:17:36.904
VERY MUCH IN FAVOR UP AS LONG AS

05:17:36.971 --> 05:17:38.439
IT'S PUT IN CONTACTS SO THAT

05:17:38.506 --> 05:17:39.407
PEOPLE UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS

05:17:39.473 --> 05:17:42.943
TO. ALLOCATE TO ENCUMBER WHAT

05:17:43.010 --> 05:17:44.779
THAT THE FACT THAT WE FLY WE

05:17:44.845 --> 05:17:46.647
HAVE THREE YEARS TO SPEND DOWN

05:17:46.714 --> 05:17:48.215
THE DOLLARS ON WHY WE WOULDN'T

05:17:48.282 --> 05:17:49.950
SPEND EVERY PENNY IN ONE YEAR. I

05:17:50.017 --> 05:17:51.152
THINK THOSE ARE IMPORTANT THINGS

05:17:51.218 --> 05:17:55.289
THAT WE HAVE TO ALL REMEMBER

05:17:55.356 --> 05:17:56.624
