00:07:28.047 --> 00:07:30.550
COMPONENT OF ALL THIS AND IT'S

00:07:30.616 --> 00:07:32.652
FRUSTRATING TO SEE US SAID TO

00:07:44.997 --> 00:07:47.767
THE IMPORTANCE OF MITIGATION AND

00:07:47.834 --> 00:07:49.569
THE IMPORTANCE OF PREVENTION --

00:07:49.635 --> 00:07:50.903
WHILE WE'RE SITTING HERE TALKING

00:07:50.970 --> 00:07:53.005
ABOUT HOW WE BAIL OUT UTILITIES

00:07:53.072 --> 00:07:55.241
AND WHAT WE DO TO PROTECT THEIR

00:07:55.308 --> 00:07:57.076
BOTTOM LINE THE BEST WAY TO

00:07:57.143 --> 00:07:58.211
PROTECT THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND

00:07:58.277 --> 00:07:59.779
MORE IMPORTANTLY THE BOTTOM LINE

00:07:59.846 --> 00:08:01.214
OF HEALTH AND SAFETY FOR OUR

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:02.815
PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

PREVENTION.

AND IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE

00:08:08.354 --> 00:08:09.755
ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WILL

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:12.124
COME ON BOARD BECAUSE IF WE

00:08:12.191 --> 00:08:13.326
DON'T HAVE HOMES TO SELL.

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:15.361
OR TO BUILD FOR A VARIETY OF

00:08:15.428 --> 00:08:17.096
REASONS THEY BURN DOWN YOUR IN A

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:19.198
HIGH RISK ZONE INSURANCE

00:08:19.265 --> 00:08:20.600
COMPANIES WON'T INSURE.

00:08:20.666 --> 00:08:22.435
MORTGAGE COMPANIES WON'T GIVE

00:08:22.501 --> 00:08:25.705

00:08:30.676 --> 00:08:32.645
PART OF THIS BATTLE OF THE HOME

00:08:32.712 --> 00:08:35.481
HARDENING OF FUND IS A GREAT

00:08:35.548 --> 00:08:36.649
IDEA I DID A BILL LAST YEAR THAT --

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.417

00:08:38.484 --> 00:08:39.986
THAT THAT PROGRAM ISN'T THE

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:43.589
PANACEA -- BUT I THINK THIS IS A

00:08:43.656 --> 00:08:46.592
A WONDERFUL BILL AND IN FACT IF

00:08:46.659 --> 00:08:48.728

HAVEN'T LANDED ON THAT

00:09:18.224 --> 00:09:20.259
UNFORTUNATELY.

00:09:20.326 --> 00:09:22.728
THE IDEA WE HAD -- HASN'T WORKED

00:09:22.795 --> 00:09:24.063
TO PAN OUT WE BELIEVE THERE ARE

00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:25.631
OPPORTUNITIES OUT THERE WILL

00:09:25.698 --> 00:09:27.600
CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT AND AND

00:09:27.667 --> 00:09:28.868
WE WILL BRING IT UP ON WHO WE

THAT IS REQUIRED TO UPGRADE.

00:10:13.512 --> 00:10:15.881
IT DOESN'T HAVE THE MEANS.

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.984
IN THEIR OWN BUDGET TO DO IT.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:19.151
THIS CONTEMPLATES THERE IS A

00:10:19.218 --> 00:10:20.786

ENVISION IT AS LOW INTEREST

00:10:27.460 --> 00:10:28.661
LOANS OR OUTRIGHT GRANTS

00:10:28.728 --> 00:10:31.197
REGIONALLY -- WE WANTED TO

WE'RE ASKING IS IN THE EVENT

00:10:35.101 --> 00:10:37.636
THAT A HOUSE IS ON THE MARKET SO.

00:10:37.703 --> 00:10:38.270
THAT.

00:10:38.337 --> 00:10:41.040
THAT THE SELLER DISCLOSE WHAT

00:10:41.107 --> 00:10:43.209
RETROFITS HAVE BEEN DONE SO THAT

00:10:43.275 --> 00:10:44.777
THE BUYER KNOWS EXACTLY WHAT

00:10:44.844 --> 00:10:45.578
THEY'RE BUYING.

00:10:45.644 --> 00:10:48.581
AND AND THAT THEY'VE HAD ALSO A

00:10:48.647 --> 00:10:52.184
AND X. A AND A A AN INSPECTION.

00:10:52.251 --> 00:10:54.487
AROUND THE PROPERTY AS WELL SO

00:10:54.553 --> 00:10:56.088
THAT THE ONCE AGAIN THE BUYER

00:10:56.155 --> 00:10:57.456
KNOWS WHAT THEY ARE BUYING A

00:10:57.523 --> 00:10:59.458
REQUIRES DISCLOSURE BUT IT

00:10:59.525 --> 00:11:04.030
WOULDN'T PREVENT SCO SO LONG AS

00:11:04.096 --> 00:11:06.065
THE DISCLOSURES BEEN MADE.

00:11:06.132 --> 00:11:07.666
CORRECT -- BUT WE AND PART OF

00:11:07.733 --> 00:11:09.068
THAT BUT IS ALSO THE DISCLOSURE

00:11:09.135 --> 00:11:10.102
IF THE DISCLOSURES BEEN DONE AS

00:11:10.169 --> 00:11:11.537
IT DOES NOT PROVIDE PREVENT THE

00:11:11.604 --> 00:11:12.571
SALE WE JUST WANT PEOPLE TO KNOW

00:11:12.638 --> 00:11:13.672
RIGHT AND THEN YOU MIGHT

00:11:13.739 --> 00:11:15.408
NEGOTIATE BETWEEN SELLER AND

00:11:15.474 --> 00:11:16.308
BUYER.

00:11:16.375 --> 00:11:17.710
IT BUT THERE'S NO MANDATE TAX

00:11:17.777 --> 00:11:19.311
RIGHT TO THE UPGRADE FOR THOSE

00:11:19.378 --> 00:11:21.013
PEOPLE WHO WHO RECOGNIZE THE

00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:22.348
NEED TO DO THE UPGRADES WE WANT

00:11:22.415 --> 00:11:23.749
TO BE ABLE TO HELP THEM OUT

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:25.217
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THIS.

00:11:25.284 --> 00:11:26.619
AND THE BILL HAS CHANGED YOU

00:11:26.685 --> 00:11:27.820
KNOW ORIGINALLY I WANTED I

00:11:27.887 --> 00:11:28.721
REALLY DID.

00:11:28.788 --> 00:11:30.222
THINK THAT MAYBE THE BEST WAY TO

00:11:30.289 --> 00:11:32.091
DO THIS WAS TO MANDATE THIS AND

00:11:32.158 --> 00:11:34.060
AND AND WE FOUND OUT WAS PART

00:11:34.126 --> 00:11:35.061
THERE'S NO THE RESOURCES ARE

00:11:35.127 --> 00:11:36.996
CHALLENGE AND SO ON BUT FOR ME

00:11:37.063 --> 00:11:38.464
ANOTHER COMPONENT IT GOES BACK

00:11:38.531 --> 00:11:39.932
TO WHAT CENTER JACKSON WAS

00:11:39.999 --> 00:11:41.434
TALKING ABOUT IS PREVENTION.

00:11:41.500 --> 00:11:42.968
THESE THESE RETROFITS ARE

00:11:43.035 --> 00:11:44.970
CRITICAL TO PREVENTION BUT ONE

00:11:45.037 --> 00:11:46.072
OF THE MOST CRITICAL THING

00:11:46.138 --> 00:11:47.640
SECOND TO THAT GOES ALONG WITH

00:11:47.706 --> 00:11:49.141
THAT IS A DEFENSIBLE SPACE PART

00:11:49.208 --> 00:11:49.809
OF THAT.

00:11:49.875 --> 00:11:52.011
WE'VE GOT TO FIND A WAY TO MAKE

00:11:52.078 --> 00:11:53.379
SURE THAT THAT THE THAT THAT.

00:11:53.446 --> 00:11:55.381
WE PROTECT IT AS MUCH ASWE CAN

00:11:55.448 --> 00:11:56.949
AROUND THE DEFENSIBLE SPACE.

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:59.718
OF COMPONENT OF THIS BILL AND

00:11:59.785 --> 00:12:00.519
THAT'S WHAT I'M GOING TO

00:12:00.586 --> 00:12:01.053
CONTINUE WORKING ON ROTH

00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:02.388

THAT ON AND I WAS TREMENDOUSLY

00:12:13.966 --> 00:12:15.568
FRUSTRATED IN THE BUDGET PROCESS

00:12:15.634 --> 00:12:17.236

A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR LONG

00:12:22.408 --> 00:12:23.709
TERM RESILIENCE FUN THAT I THINK

00:12:23.776 --> 00:12:25.578
THIS COULD HAVE CERTAINLY BEEN A

00:12:25.644 --> 00:12:29.048
CANDIDATE -- FOR I THINK WE

00:12:29.115 --> 00:12:31.383
APPROPRIATED ABOUT A A BILLION

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:33.319
OR SO TO CAL FIRE THAT STILL MAY

00:12:33.385 --> 00:12:36.822
BE A VIABLE PATHWAY BUT BETWEEN

00:12:36.889 --> 00:12:38.224
SB ONE EIGHTY TWO WHICH IS

00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:40.159

TODAY FIFTEEN SIXTEEN WHICH ALSO.

00:12:46.165 --> 00:12:48.234
IS IMPORTANT PIECE THAT PUZZLE

00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:49.635
AND DIED AS A FEW MEASURES.

00:12:49.702 --> 00:12:51.237
WE'VE GOT TO PUT A PREVENTION

00:12:51.303 --> 00:12:53.038
PACKAGE TOGETHER I THINK ON A BI

00:12:53.105 --> 00:12:54.840
CAMERA WILL BASIS AND I THINK

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:55.508
THIS IS.

00:12:55.574 --> 00:12:57.076
THE ONE OF THE LYNCH PINS OF

00:12:57.143 --> 00:12:59.745
THAT FRAMEWORK -- THESE ARE THE

00:12:59.812 --> 00:13:01.614
THE BIG EXPENSIVE RETROFITS TO

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:03.315
THAT WERE WERE THINKING ABOUT

00:13:03.382 --> 00:13:04.750
HERE WHERE IF TO REMAKE THE

00:13:04.817 --> 00:13:06.185
ENTIRE HOME THIS IS A SIMPLE IN

00:13:06.252 --> 00:13:07.686
SOME CASES PUTTING SOME GAS

00:13:07.753 --> 00:13:08.687
GETTING.

00:13:08.754 --> 00:13:09.588
AS I UNDERSTAND IT ON YOUR

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:11.524
GARAGE OR MAKING SURE YOUR

00:13:11.590 --> 00:13:13.425

YOU KNOW THOSE OF US WHO HAVE

00:13:14.527 --> 00:13:16.061
BIG DECKS AND THINGS LIKE THAT

00:13:16.128 --> 00:13:17.396
OKAY WELL YOU IN THAT CASE YOU

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.931
MAY HAVE TO HARDEN YOUR DECK BUT

00:13:18.998 --> 00:13:20.232
FOR THE AVERAGE FAMILY.

00:13:20.299 --> 00:13:21.700
WOULD TALK I MEAN WHEN WE TALK

00:13:21.767 --> 00:13:23.536
TO THE FIRE MARSHAL -- REACH

00:13:23.602 --> 00:13:24.503
WINE.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:27.072
THE ESTIMATE WAS FIVE HUNDRED

00:13:27.139 --> 00:13:28.307
BUCKS WOULD EVEN GET YOU SOME

00:13:28.374 --> 00:13:29.141
WAYS MAYBE EVEN A THOUSAND

00:13:29.208 --> 00:13:30.743
DOLLARS YOU SEE I MEAN IN TERMS

00:13:30.809 --> 00:13:32.711
OF PRICE RANGES AND SORT OF THE

00:13:32.778 --> 00:13:34.313
EASY LOW HANGING FRUIT.

00:13:34.380 --> 00:13:37.216
IS IT IS THIS -- IS THIS GOING

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.218
TO HELP YOU GET TO THOSE THOSE

00:13:39.285 --> 00:13:40.452
LOW HANGING PIECES MAYBE THERE'S

00:13:40.519 --> 00:13:42.688
BIGGER PIECES TO THAT YOU MIGHT

00:13:42.755 --> 00:13:43.322
NEED A LOAN FOR VIET MORE MEANS

00:13:43.389 --> 00:13:45.624
BUT DO YOU ENVISION THOSE ARE

00:13:45.691 --> 00:13:47.259
THE LOW COST EASY WHEN GAS AND

00:13:47.326 --> 00:13:48.260
AND AND WE'RE WORKING TO

00:13:48.327 --> 00:13:49.762
IDENTIFY EXACTLY WHAT THOSE ARE.

00:13:49.828 --> 00:13:51.096
AND AND TO GIVE PEOPLE AN IDEA

00:13:51.163 --> 00:13:53.098
WHAT THOSE LOW COST RETROFITS

00:13:53.165 --> 00:13:55.334
MIGHT MIGHT COST -- BUT YOU KNOW

00:13:55.401 --> 00:13:56.802
I COULD GO BACK TO SOME OF THAT

00:13:56.869 --> 00:13:58.337
DEFENSIBLE SPACES IS NOT A

00:13:58.404 --> 00:14:01.407

ACTIVITIES TO PROTECT YOUR HOME

WANT TO KNOW THE BEST WAY TO

00:14:08.914 --> 00:14:10.316
PROTECT THE HOME AND AND GIVE

00:14:10.382 --> 00:14:11.951

00:14:12.017 --> 00:14:12.985
WITH IF WE CAN DO THAT.

00:14:13.052 --> 00:14:14.186

EDUCATION I BELIEVE IS.

00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.661
THE OSTENSIBLE PURPOSE OF THOSE

COASTAL ZONE GOVERNED BY THE

01:02:16.432 --> 01:02:17.733

01:02:45.962 --> 01:02:46.729
HAVE JURISDICTION HERE.

01:02:46.796 --> 01:02:47.330
BECAUSE THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:42.785
TREMENDOUS AMOUNTOF THAT.

01:03:42.852 --> 01:03:44.921

EXPAND [inaudible]

01:05:26.322 --> 01:05:27.123
A TERMINAL.

01:05:27.189 --> 01:05:28.457
THIS PROJECT IS DESIGNED TO

01:05:28.524 --> 01:05:30.393
ACCOMMODATE A WIDER TURNING BASE

01:05:30.459 --> 01:05:33.329
IN IN THE CHANNEL ITSELF I WOULD

01:05:33.396 --> 01:05:35.031
THAT BE ACCOMPLISHED ANOTHER

01:05:35.097 --> 01:05:37.233
WORDS THE PROJECT ALLOWS A

01:05:37.300 --> 01:05:38.901
PORTION OF THE LAND TO BE SET

01:05:38.968 --> 01:05:41.304
ASIDE SO THAT IF WE ACTUALLY AND

01:05:41.370 --> 01:05:42.672
AGAIN WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT WE

01:05:42.738 --> 01:05:43.506
WILL NEED TO THIS.

01:05:43.572 --> 01:05:45.074
IS ALL BEING STUDIED BY THE ARMY

TREMENDOUSLY ABOUT THIS.

01:05:58.654 --> 01:06:00.423
SO WE HAVE STUDIED POTENTIAL

01:06:00.489 --> 01:06:02.792
WIDENING OF THE TURNING BASIN

01:06:02.858 --> 01:06:04.126
AND THAT MEANS THAT A SHIP KIND

01:06:04.193 --> 01:06:06.195
O PULLS IN AND THEN LITERALLY

01:06:06.262 --> 01:06:07.530

THERE RIGHT NOW IT'S DUG OUT AND

01:06:13.703 --> 01:06:15.705
IT IT HAS TO BE WIDE ENOUGH TO

01:06:15.771 --> 01:06:17.473
THE WHOLE SHIP CAN TURN AROUND

01:09:31.333 --> 01:09:32.768
LOCAL CONTROL ISSUE SO I'M

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.803
TRYING TO GET TO YES ON THIS

01:09:34.870 --> 01:09:38.207

THERE'S A SOME TRYING TO FOCUS

01:09:51.787 --> 01:09:53.656
ON THE STATE ISSUES HERE ARE IN

01:09:53.722 --> 01:09:56.325
IN AND ANALYZING THIS BILL.

01:09:56.392 --> 01:09:58.727
AND SO I I THINK I'M DOWN TO TWO

01:09:58.794 --> 01:10:01.730
QUESTIONS -- AND I'D AND THINK

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:03.165
I'M AS EASY ONE FOR ALL ASSN

01:10:03.232 --> 01:10:04.033
BOTH AND THEN YOU ANSWER HOW YOU

01:10:04.099 --> 01:10:05.034
AN ANSWER -- IT'S BEEN BROUGHT

01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.669
UP SEVERAL TIMES THAT THERE'S IN

01:10:06.735 --> 01:10:07.303
THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED HOUSING

01:10:07.369 --> 01:10:10.272
UNITS -- AS PART OF THIS PROJECT

01:10:10.339 --> 01:10:12.875
I VAST -- YOU KNOW PROPONENTS ON

01:10:12.942 --> 01:10:14.376
BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE ABOUT

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:15.678
THAT SO IF YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT

01:10:15.744 --> 01:10:17.947
AND AND RATE REALLY WHAT MY

01:10:18.013 --> 01:10:19.582
CONCERN IS BASED ON MY KNOWLEDGE

01:10:19.648 --> 01:10:21.016
ON IT BEING A CITY COUNCIL IN

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:23.319
ZONING. TO FIT TWENTY FIVE

01:10:23.385 --> 01:10:25.654
HUNDRED UNITS ON THIS PIECE OF

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.289
PROPERTY YOU'RE GONNA.

01:10:27.356 --> 01:10:28.057
YOU KNOW I'M JUST GUESSING AT

01:10:28.123 --> 01:10:28.958
THIS POINT TIME AND PINS THAT

01:10:29.024 --> 01:10:30.192
ARE COMPLETELY BUT THIRTY STORY

01:10:30.259 --> 01:10:30.926
BUILDINGS ARE GOING TO GET IT

01:10:30.993 --> 01:10:32.628
DONE YOU HAVE TO HAVE SIXTY

01:10:32.695 --> 01:10:34.997
SEVENTY STORY BUILDINGS. TO GET

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.365
TO TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED UNITS ON

01:10:36.432 --> 01:10:38.000
THIS SMALL PIECE OF PROPERTY --

01:10:38.067 --> 01:10:39.068
SO WHERE THE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:10:39.134 --> 01:10:42.738
UNITS GOING OUT OR IS THAT EVEN.

01:10:42.805 --> 01:10:46.675
IT IS THE PROJECT -- RELIANT ON

01:10:46.742 --> 01:10:48.644
THAT -- AND IN THIS I THINK THAT

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.279
THE STATE ISSUE THAT I'M MOST

01:10:50.346 --> 01:10:51.547
CONCERNED ABOUT IS ON THE LAND

01:10:51.614 --> 01:10:54.183
SWAP -- THIS THE TAXPAYERS OF

01:10:54.250 --> 01:10:56.619
CALIFORNIA ARE GIVING UP.

01:10:56.685 --> 01:10:58.120
A POTENTIALLY VERY VALUABLE

01:10:58.187 --> 01:11:00.289
PIECE OF PROPERTY HERE IN THE

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:01.223
BAY.

01:11:01.290 --> 01:11:02.491
WHAT ARE THE TAXPAYERS OF

01:11:02.558 --> 01:11:03.626
CALIFORNIA?

01:11:03.692 --> 01:11:07.429
GETTING IN RETURN OF EQUAL OR

01:11:07.496 --> 01:11:10.299
GREATER VALUE THAN WHAT THE TAX

01:11:10.366 --> 01:11:12.835
PAYERS ARE GIVING UP.

01:11:12.901 --> 01:11:14.103
THOSE TWO THINGS THIS LAND SWAP

01:11:14.169 --> 01:11:15.704
IN THAT AND THE NUMBER OF UNITS.

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:16.372
AND THE AND THE NUMBER OF UNITS

01:11:16.438 --> 01:11:17.773
IS MORE OF A CURIOSITY THAN

01:11:17.840 --> 01:11:19.308
ACTUALLY I MEAN ON THE NUMBER OF

01:11:19.375 --> 01:11:20.476
UNITS YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN

01:11:20.542 --> 01:11:21.276
WORKING WTH THE ARCHANGELS

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:22.611
GROUP IN FIELD OPERATIONS OUR

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:23.445
DESIGN TEAM.

01:11:23.512 --> 01:11:24.880
AND ACTUALLY WE CAN HAVE AN

01:11:24.947 --> 01:11:27.950
ASSORTMENT OF SIZES OF BUILDINGS

01:11:28.017 --> 01:11:29.385
TO ACCOMMODATE THAT NUMBER AND

01:11:29.451 --> 01:11:30.619
KEEP IN MIND THAT'S JUST A

01:11:30.686 --> 01:11:32.521
PROPOSAL THAT WE PUT FORTY THE

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:33.589
INITIAL SEQUEL STUDIES.

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:34.523
SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GO

01:11:34.590 --> 01:11:35.157
THROUGH THAT WHOLE PROCESS

01:11:35.224 --> 01:11:38.227
DETERMINE WHAT IS VIABLE AT THAT

01:11:38.293 --> 01:11:40.129
LOCATION.

01:11:40.195 --> 01:11:40.729
SO WHAT WHAT I'M HEARING YOU

01:11:40.796 --> 01:11:41.630
ANSWER NOW IS THE PROJECT IS NOT

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:42.731
DEPENDENT UPON THE NUMBER OF

01:11:42.798 --> 01:11:46.568
UNITS -- BEING PROPOSED WE WE

01:11:46.635 --> 01:11:48.137
STILL HAVE TO STUDY THAT TO

01:24:59.227 --> 01:25:01.029
WOULD BRING STATEWIDE -- A

01:25:01.095 --> 01:25:02.063
POLICY THAT'S ALREADY BEEN

01:25:02.130 --> 01:25:03.264
INSTITUTED IN SOME OF OUR

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:04.499
LARGEST CITIES INCLUDING LOS

01:25:04.566 --> 01:25:07.535
ANGELES AND SAN FRANCISCO.

01:25:07.602 --> 01:25:08.870
WILL THAT WOULD REINFORCE

01:25:08.937 --> 01:25:11.039
CALIFORNIA'S VALUES OF MAKING

01:25:11.105 --> 01:25:13.475
SURE THAT PRODUCTS THAT WE OFFER

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.776
TO CONSUMERS IN THE STATE OF

01:25:14.843 --> 01:25:17.278
CALIFORNIA ARE AS CRUELTY FREE

01:25:17.345 --> 01:25:18.112
AS POSSIBLE.

01:25:18.179 --> 01:25:19.414
NOW THE VOTERS IN CALIFORNIA

01:25:19.481 --> 01:25:20.815
HAVE TOLD US IN MORE THAN ONE

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:23.117
OCCASION THAT IF THEY BY.

01:25:23.184 --> 01:25:25.753
AEGS IF THEY PURCHASE MEAT THEY

01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.555
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:30.058
PRODUCT HAS BEEN RECENT AWAY

01:25:30.124 --> 01:25:31.960
THAT IS THIS FREE IS CRUELTY AS

01:25:32.026 --> 01:25:33.094
WE CAN GET.

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:34.696
BUT WE HAVE NO WAY OF DOING THAT

01:25:34.762 --> 01:25:36.664
WITH THE FOR INDUSTRY MOST FOR

01:25:36.731 --> 01:25:38.900
PRODUCTS COME FROM OVERSEAS.

01:25:38.967 --> 01:25:40.535
FROM COUNTRIES WERE REGULATION

01:25:40.602 --> 01:25:42.737
IS IMPOSSIBLE MANY ANIMALS THAT

01:25:42.804 --> 01:25:44.138
ARE USED FOR FOR PRODUCTS ARE

01:25:44.205 --> 01:25:45.707
ANIMALS THAT BY THEIR VERY

01:25:45.773 --> 01:25:47.342
NATURE IS WILD ANIMAL SUFFER

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:48.977
WHEN THEY'RE IN CAPTIVITY UNLIKE

01:25:49.043 --> 01:25:50.245
DOMESTICATED ANIMALS.

01:25:50.311 --> 01:25:52.780
NOW THIS BILL TRIES TO BE A

01:25:52.847 --> 01:25:55.416
REASONABLE BILL THAT ALLOWS FOR

01:25:55.483 --> 01:25:57.085
FOR PRODUCTS THAT ARE FROM

01:25:57.151 --> 01:25:58.987
ANIMALS THAT ARE USED FOR MEAT

01:25:59.053 --> 01:26:01.022
SUCH AS QUE HOUSE COWS.

01:26:01.089 --> 01:26:02.590
OR SHEEP WITH SHEARLING TO BE

01:26:02.657 --> 01:26:04.526
USE STILL FOR THEIR FOR BECAUSE

01:26:04.592 --> 01:26:05.693
IT'S MY BELIEF THAT IF YOU'RE

01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:07.495
GOING TO FORM AN ANIMAL YOU

01:26:07.562 --> 01:26:08.530
SHOULD USE EVERY PART OF THAT

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:09.364
ANIMAL.

01:26:09.430 --> 01:26:12.166
FROM NOSE TO TAIL SO WE TRIED TO

01:26:12.233 --> 01:26:13.835
IN THE CRAFT A BILL THAT STILL

01:26:13.902 --> 01:26:15.403
ALLOWS ANIMALS THAT ARE USED FOR

01:26:15.470 --> 01:26:18.072
ME TO HAVE THEIR HIDES IN THERE

01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:22.443
FOR USED. FOR CLOTHING.

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:23.545
BUT WITH PROP WITH THE ANIMALS

01:26:23.611 --> 01:26:24.178
THAT ARE EITHER REYES FOR FOUR

01:26:24.245 --> 01:26:25.980
OR MORE COMMONLY TRAPPED IN THE

01:26:26.047 --> 01:26:27.315
WILD THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

01:26:27.382 --> 01:26:29.651
THOSE ANIMALS ARE TAKEN ONLY FOR

01:26:29.717 --> 01:26:31.119
THEIR PELTS THE REST OF THE

01:26:31.185 --> 01:26:33.621
ANIMAL IS BASICALLY DISCARDED

01:26:33.688 --> 01:26:34.923
ARE TREATED AS A WASTE PRODUCT.

01:26:34.989 --> 01:26:36.257
SO THESE ARE ANIMALS THAT ARE

01:26:36.324 --> 01:26:37.959
SUFFERING THAT ARE BEING TRAPPED

01:26:38.026 --> 01:26:40.228
IN THE WILD LEFT IN KEY IN LATE

01:26:40.295 --> 01:26:42.730
THE HOLDS -- LEFT TO DIE

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:44.499
MISERABLY OR WHEN THEY WERE

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:46.601
RAISED FOR THE FOR INDUSTRY.

01:26:46.668 --> 01:26:48.136
KILLED IN A WAY THAT IS NOT

01:26:48.202 --> 01:26:50.505
REGULATED BY ANY OF OUR LAWS

01:26:50.572 --> 01:26:51.873
BECAUSE REGULATION AND HOW

01:26:51.940 --> 01:26:53.374
ANIMALS ARE SLAUGHTERED ARE ONLY

01:26:53.441 --> 01:26:56.477
GOVERNED FOR FOOD ANIMALS.

01:26:56.544 --> 01:26:58.279
SO WE HAVE -- CERTAINLY SEEN

01:26:58.346 --> 01:26:59.981
EVIDENCE OF REALLY HORRIFIC

01:27:00.048 --> 01:27:01.149
PRACTICES IN THE FOR INDUSTRY

01:27:01.215 --> 01:27:03.151
PARTICULARLY OVERSEAS BUT

01:27:03.217 --> 01:27:04.419
DOMESTICALLY AS WELL.

01:27:04.485 --> 01:27:06.387
OUR CONSUMERS HAVE TOLD US THAT

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:08.056
THEY EXPECTED OF CALVET PRODUCT

01:27:08.122 --> 01:27:09.691
IS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THAT IT'S

01:27:09.757 --> 01:27:11.192
BEEN HUMANELY RAISED AND

01:27:11.259 --> 01:27:13.428
SLAUGHTERED WE CAN'T GUARANTEE

01:27:13.494 --> 01:27:14.729
THAT WITH THE FOR INDUSTRY SO

01:27:14.796 --> 01:27:16.230
IT'S TIME THAT WE TAKE.

01:27:16.297 --> 01:27:17.265
THE LOCAL BANDS THAT HAVE

01:27:17.332 --> 01:27:18.299
ALREADY BEEN INSTITUTED AND

01:27:18.366 --> 01:27:19.801
BRING THAT STATEWIDE WHICH I

01:27:19.867 --> 01:27:20.868
BELIEVE IS IN KEEPING WITH

01:27:20.935 --> 01:27:22.003
CALIFORNIA'S VALUES.

01:27:22.070 --> 01:27:23.838
I'D ALSO LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT

01:27:23.905 --> 01:27:25.506
MANY OF OUR LARGEST -- CLOTHING

01:27:25.573 --> 01:27:29.777
MANUFACTURERS HAVE THEMSELVES

01:27:29.844 --> 01:27:30.678
GONE FOR FREE.

01:27:30.745 --> 01:27:31.613
THE REASON IS BECAUSE SOME OF

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:32.480
THEM OF TOLD US THAT THEY HAVE

01:27:32.547 --> 01:27:35.216
GONE TO TRY TO SOURCE HUMANE FOR

01:27:35.283 --> 01:27:36.351
AROUND THE WORLD AND WHEN THEY

01:27:36.417 --> 01:27:37.719
DONE THAT AND THEY'VE GONE ON

01:27:37.785 --> 01:27:39.220
TRIPS TO LOOK AT FOR

01:27:39.287 --> 01:27:41.155
MANUFACTURERS TO LOOK AT FOR

01:27:41.222 --> 01:27:41.823
FARMS.

01:27:41.889 --> 01:27:43.825
THEY HAVE NOT FELT THAT THAT WAS

01:27:43.891 --> 01:27:45.059
IN KEEPING WITH THEIR VALUES IS

01:27:45.126 --> 01:27:46.461
A COMPANY THAT THEY COULDN'T

01:27:46.527 --> 01:27:47.996
GUARANTEE THAT THOSE ANIMALS

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:50.264
WERE REYES CRUELTY FREE AND SO

01:27:50.331 --> 01:27:51.933
THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE NOT GOING

01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:53.267

01:27:53.334 --> 01:27:54.769

01:27:56.037 --> 01:27:57.605
MAN'S BUT IN CALIFORNIA WE LIKE

01:27:57.672 --> 01:27:58.940
TO LEAD NOT FOLLOW.

01:27:59.007 --> 01:28:00.041
AND I BELIEVE THAT IT'S IT'S

01:28:00.108 --> 01:28:01.643
TIME FOR US TO TAKE THE FIRST

01:56:59.312 --> 01:57:01.180
IN THE PARTICULARLY THE NATIVE

01:57:01.247 --> 01:57:03.249
AMERICAN CULTURE THERE IS

01:57:03.316 --> 01:57:06.119
SOMETHING MORE. TO THE PROCESS

01:57:06.185 --> 01:57:07.620
AND WANTING TO WEAR FOR INTO THE

01:57:07.687 --> 01:57:09.088
SLAUGHTER ANIMALS SO I'M

01:57:09.155 --> 01:57:10.523
WONDERING HAVE YOU CONSIDERED

01:57:10.590 --> 01:57:12.458
PERHAPS TAKING AN AMENDMENT THAT

01:57:12.525 --> 01:57:13.626
WOULD.

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:14.660
OR IF YOU'VE ALREADY TAKEN A

01:57:14.727 --> 01:57:15.762
BECAUSE I APOLOGIZE I'VE BEEN

01:57:15.828 --> 01:57:17.230
ANOTHER COMMITTEE THAT

01:57:17.296 --> 01:57:19.665
RECOGNIZES IN SOME INSTANCES

01:57:19.732 --> 01:57:22.335
THERE IS A CULTURAL LARA

01:57:22.402 --> 01:57:24.470
RELIGIOUS OR ANOTHER TRADITIONAL

01:57:24.537 --> 01:57:25.938
ASPECT TO IT.

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:28.775
NOT THAT I WOULD NECESSARILY DO

01:57:28.841 --> 01:57:30.109
THAT BUT I WANT TO RESPECT.

01:57:30.176 --> 01:57:32.412
OTHER CULTURES WHERE THIS IS NOT

01:57:32.478 --> 01:57:35.448
JUST SO MUCH TO SEE IF YOU CAN.

01:57:35.515 --> 01:57:37.183
SHOWOFF YOUR FANCY FOR TO YOUR

01:57:37.250 --> 01:57:39.585
FRIENDS -- THANK YOU SENATOR

01:57:39.652 --> 01:57:41.254
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION -- A

01:57:41.320 --> 01:57:43.456
SECTION SEE THREE SPECIFICALLY

01:57:43.523 --> 01:57:46.092
EXAMS NATIVE AMERICAN --

01:57:46.159 --> 01:57:48.594
ACTIVITIES OKAY I APPRECIATE

01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:52.498
THAT AND WELL I APPRECIATE THAT

01:57:52.565 --> 01:57:53.800
THERE MAY HAVE BEEN A TIME THERE

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:56.569
WAS A TIME WHEN. FOR DID PROTECT

01:57:56.636 --> 01:57:58.171
PEOPLE AND KEEP THE MORMON I

01:57:58.237 --> 01:57:59.939
SUPPORT THAT NOTION THAT WE

01:58:00.006 --> 01:58:02.575
REALLY -- IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES

01:58:02.642 --> 01:58:04.644
IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AGAIN I

01:58:04.710 --> 01:58:07.680
JUST -- I FIND IT TROUBLESOME TO

01:58:07.747 --> 01:58:10.817
THINK THE WE REALLY NEED TO TO

01:58:10.883 --> 01:58:14.187
ENGAGE IN THIS KIND OF BEHAVIOR --

01:58:14.253 --> 01:58:15.988
BUT THERE WAS ONE POINT THAT WAS

01:58:16.055 --> 01:58:17.190
MADE BY THE OPPOSITION AYE I

01:58:17.256 --> 01:58:19.091
WOULD LIKE YOU TO RESPOND TO THE

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:20.593
NOTION THAT THERE ARE.

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:22.528
IF YOU WILL GOOD GOOD ACTORS AND

01:58:22.595 --> 01:58:25.431
BAD ACTORS IN THIS INDUSTRY AND

01:58:25.498 --> 01:58:27.366
WHILE WOULD ONLY BE BANNING THIS

01:58:27.433 --> 01:58:29.402
HEARING CALIFORNIA WHICH MEANS

01:58:29.469 --> 01:58:31.304
THAT OTHER STATES COULD CONTINUE

01:58:31.370 --> 01:58:33.773
WITH THIS BEHAVIOR -- THERE HAS

01:58:33.840 --> 01:58:35.942
BEEN IF I UNDERSTOOD CORRECTLY A

01:58:36.008 --> 01:58:38.678
HIGHER STANDARD OR FOR THOSE WHO

01:58:38.744 --> 01:58:40.213
PARTICIPATE IN A PARTICULAR

01:58:40.279 --> 01:58:41.848
INDUSTRY GROUP.

01:58:41.914 --> 01:58:46.385
THAT WOULD BE THREATENED -- BY A

01:58:46.452 --> 01:58:48.387
BY OUR EFFORT HERE EVEN THOUGH

01:58:48.454 --> 01:58:50.256
I'D LIKE A THE FACT WERE FIRST

01:58:50.323 --> 01:58:51.724
IN A LOT OF GREAT THINGS AND

01:58:51.791 --> 01:58:53.159
LEAD THE COUNTRY.

01:58:53.226 --> 01:58:55.261
I JUST WONDER IF THE THAT MIGHT

01:58:55.328 --> 01:58:57.930
CREATE SOME KIND OF A COMPROMISE

01:58:57.997 --> 01:59:00.600
SITUATION -- FOR FOR THOSE WHO

01:59:00.666 --> 01:59:02.068
INSIST UPON.

01:59:02.134 --> 01:59:04.871
UP PRODUCING -- FOR IF FOR THOSE

01:59:04.937 --> 01:59:06.305
FOLKS WHO WERE TRYING TO DO IT

01:59:06.372 --> 01:59:07.607
IN THE MOST HUMANE.

01:59:07.673 --> 01:59:09.542
WAY POSSIBLE TO THE EXTENT THERE

01:59:09.609 --> 01:59:12.979
IS A HUMANE WAY COULD YOU

01:59:13.045 --> 01:59:14.447
RESPOND TO THAT CONCERT.

01:59:14.514 --> 01:59:15.314
THANK YOU SENATOR IF I

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:16.048
UNDERSTAND THE COURT QUESTION

01:59:16.115 --> 01:59:18.484
CORRECTLY IT'S ABOUT -- STILL BE

01:59:18.551 --> 01:59:20.052
ABLE TO PRODUCE AND PURCHASE FOR

01:59:20.119 --> 01:59:21.187
ON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WHICH

01:59:21.254 --> 01:59:22.588
IS CERTAINLY TRUE UNDER THIS

01:59:22.655 --> 01:59:24.423
BILL I WOULD POINT OUT THAT WE

01:59:24.490 --> 01:59:26.225
HAD A LOT OF THE SAME ARGUMENTS

01:59:26.292 --> 01:59:27.727
ABOUT THE COSMETIC TESTING.

01:59:27.793 --> 01:59:29.896
AND OTHER COSMETIC RELATED --

01:59:29.962 --> 01:59:32.331
THE ISSUES AND WHAT HAPPENED WAS

01:59:32.398 --> 01:59:33.366
INSTEAD OF PUSHING THOSE

01:59:33.432 --> 01:59:35.067
INDUSTRIES OUT OF THE STATE

01:59:35.134 --> 01:59:36.135
EIGHT OTHERSTATES AT THIS POINT

01:59:36.202 --> 01:59:37.803
HAVE FOLLOW CALIFORNIA'S LEAD.

01:59:37.870 --> 01:59:40.339
AND ADOPTED THE SAME POLICIES

01:59:40.406 --> 01:59:42.508
I'M CREATING JUST NATURALLY MORE

01:59:42.575 --> 01:59:44.310
OF A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WE HAVE

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:45.611
ALSO HEARD THE SAME ARGUMENT

01:59:45.678 --> 01:59:48.247
WHEN IT CAME TO GETTING CHICKENS

01:59:48.314 --> 01:59:49.382
ARE A BEARING CHICKENS.

01:59:49.448 --> 01:59:52.752
MORE ROOM AND GIVING FARM

01:59:52.818 --> 01:59:54.153
ANIMALS ARE MORE HUMANE

01:59:54.220 --> 01:59:56.022
STANDARDS AND THE CALIFORNIA

01:59:56.088 --> 01:59:57.089
VOTERS WHEN THIS HAS GONE ON THE

01:59:57.156 --> 01:59:58.958
BALLOT OVER AND OVER AGAIN HAVE

01:59:59.025 --> 01:59:59.692
SAID.

01:59:59.759 --> 02:00:01.193
YOU KNOW OUR CONCERN IS LESS

02:00:01.260 --> 02:00:02.094
WITH THE REST OF THE COUNTRY BUT

02:00:02.161 --> 02:00:03.696
WE WANT TO KNOW THAT IF WE

02:00:03.763 --> 02:00:05.565
PURCHASE A PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA.

02:00:05.631 --> 02:00:06.666
THEN IT IS CRUELTY FREE AS

02:00:06.732 --> 02:00:08.401
POSSIBLE I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE

02:00:08.467 --> 02:00:08.901
CAN.

02:00:08.968 --> 02:00:10.503
WE CAN DO THAT WITH THIS

02:00:10.570 --> 02:00:13.472
INDUSTRY GIVEN THE PLACES WERE A

02:00:13.539 --> 02:00:14.340
LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE

02:00:14.407 --> 02:00:15.942
PRODUCED WHICH IS IN CHINA AS

02:00:16.008 --> 02:00:18.277
THE NUMBER ONE PRODUCTION --

02:00:18.344 --> 02:00:23.282
COUNTRY FOR FOR AND I WOULD.

02:00:23.349 --> 02:00:23.916
IS SAY THAT IT'S VERY DIFFICULT

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:24.550
TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN THOSE

02:00:24.617 --> 02:00:25.551
COUNTRIES EVEN FOR APPLE WITH

02:00:25.618 --> 02:00:27.620
THEIR PHONES WE'VE HEARD ABOUT A

02:00:27.687 --> 02:00:28.821
LOT OF ABUSIVE WERE ABUSIVE

02:00:28.888 --> 02:00:30.623
WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT AND HERE

02:00:30.690 --> 02:00:32.258
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ANIMALS AND

02:00:32.325 --> 02:00:35.127
TRYING TO POLICE THAT -- SO --

02:00:35.194 --> 02:00:36.929
AND AND SECONDLY JUST BY THEIR

02:00:36.996 --> 02:00:38.230
NATURE.

02:00:38.297 --> 02:00:39.632
ANIMALS THAT ARE NOT

02:00:39.699 --> 02:00:41.334
DOMESTICATED ANIMALS ARE WILD

02:00:41.400 --> 02:00:43.603
ANIMALS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO

02:00:43.669 --> 02:00:45.104
KEEP INTACT CAPTIVITY.

02:00:45.171 --> 02:00:47.206
I REPRESENT THE LA ZOO IN MY

02:00:47.273 --> 02:00:49.141
DISTRICT THEY SPEND MILLIONS OF

02:00:49.208 --> 02:00:51.544
DOLLARS A YEAR TRYING TO DO FOR

02:00:51.611 --> 02:00:53.045
FILM AND FOR THOSE ANIMALS

02:00:53.112 --> 02:00:54.580
BECAUSE THEIR WILD ANIMALS THAT

02:00:54.647 --> 02:00:57.116
NEED TO MOVE THAT NEED TO ROME.

02:00:57.183 --> 02:00:58.017
OTHERWISE THEY DO THIS FOR A

02:00:58.084 --> 02:01:00.219
DISPLAY STRESSED BEHAVIOR WITH

02:01:00.286 --> 02:01:01.721
THESE ANIMALS KEPT IN SMALL

02:01:01.787 --> 02:01:03.689
CAGES THERE'S NO WAY TO DO THAT

02:01:03.756 --> 02:01:05.224
IN A HUMANE WAY.

02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:06.592
SO I GUESS THE THAT THE AND I

02:01:06.659 --> 02:01:08.427
APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING CLEAR

02:01:08.494 --> 02:01:10.196
AND THE QUESTION WAS SENT OUT MY

02:01:10.262 --> 02:01:10.796
UNDERSTANDING WAS WAS IT AND

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:12.365
SOMEBODY TESTIFYING ABOUT THE

02:01:12.431 --> 02:01:13.899
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS THERE IS

02:01:13.966 --> 02:01:14.867
A GROUP.

02:01:14.934 --> 02:01:17.503
THAT ACTUALLY WOULD LIKE TO BE

02:01:17.570 --> 02:01:19.405
AS HUMANE AS POSSIBLE IN THEIR

02:01:19.472 --> 02:01:21.140
TREATMENT OF THESE ANIMALS SO I

02:01:21.207 --> 02:01:22.875
THEY'RE SORT OF THE MID THE MID

02:01:22.942 --> 02:01:24.810
WAY GROUP BETWEEN KNOLL.

02:01:24.877 --> 02:01:28.981
OF PRODUCTION AND OR KILLING AND

02:01:29.048 --> 02:01:29.882
TRYING TO BE POLITE ABOUT THIS

02:01:29.949 --> 02:01:32.184
BUT AND IN DOING IT AS HUMANELY

02:01:32.251 --> 02:01:33.619
AS POSSIBLE SO I MISUNDERSTOOD

02:01:33.686 --> 02:01:35.488
THE QUESTION SO I WOULD SAY THAT

02:01:35.554 --> 02:01:37.256
THE CONCERNS ABOUT FOR HAVE BEEN

02:01:37.323 --> 02:01:38.124
REYES.

02:01:38.190 --> 02:01:39.525
FOR DECADES NOW WE'VE HEARD WE

02:01:39.592 --> 02:01:41.627
HAD ANTI FOR CAMPAIGNS IN THIS

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:43.929
COUNTRY FOR DECADES AND YET WE

02:01:43.996 --> 02:01:45.164
DON'T HAVE THAT PROGRAM WE DON'T

02:01:45.231 --> 02:01:46.799
HAVE IT THAT ASSURANCE WHY AT

02:01:46.866 --> 02:01:48.067
THIS MOMENT ARE THEY OFFERING

02:01:48.134 --> 02:01:49.702
THAT WHEN THEY'VE HAD FIFTY

02:01:49.769 --> 02:01:51.404
YEARS OF PEOPLE RAISING CONCERNS

02:01:51.470 --> 02:01:52.171
ABOUT.

02:01:52.238 --> 02:01:52.972
FOR FROM THE DAYS THAT IT CAME

02:01:53.039 --> 02:01:55.074
OUT THAT BABY SEALS WERE CLUBBED

02:01:55.141 --> 02:01:57.743
TO DEATH UNTIL NOW.

02:01:57.810 --> 02:01:58.611
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN GREAT IF

02:01:58.678 --> 02:01:59.278
TWENTY YEARS AGO THAT WOULD HAVE

02:01:59.345 --> 02:01:59.979
BEEN INSTITUTED AND EVERY FOR

02:02:00.046 --> 02:02:01.514
THAT WAS PURCHASED IN CALIFORNIA

02:02:01.580 --> 02:02:03.983
HAD THAT CERTIFICATION IT DIDN'T

02:02:04.050 --> 02:02:05.518
AND SO WE ARE WE ARE TODAY.

02:02:05.584 --> 02:02:06.652
AND I WOULD SAY THAT WE SHOULD

02:02:06.719 --> 02:02:08.120
ACT ON THIS NOW THE WAY THAT LOS

02:02:08.187 --> 02:02:09.755
ANGELES HAS AND SAN FRANCISCO

02:02:09.822 --> 02:02:15.728
HAS AND BRING UNIFORMITY TO THIS

02:02:15.795 --> 02:02:17.096
TO THE STATE.

02:02:17.163 --> 02:02:18.698
JACKSON CENTER BORDERS.

02:02:18.764 --> 02:02:20.066
GERMAN -- I THINK -- MY

02:02:20.132 --> 02:02:21.934
COLLEAGUE FROM -- SANTA BARBARA

02:02:22.001 --> 02:02:24.003
WAS GOING ON LINE OF QUESTIONING

02:02:24.070 --> 02:02:27.606
THAT I INTENDED TO AS WELL --

02:02:27.673 --> 02:02:30.443
MAYBE I'LL POSE MY QUESTION.

02:02:30.509 --> 02:02:31.811
TO JOHN THAT TALKED ABOUT --

02:02:31.877 --> 02:02:33.879
INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS FOR THE

02:02:33.946 --> 02:02:36.048
HUMANE TREATMENT OF OF OF

02:02:36.115 --> 02:02:37.717
ANIMALS I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

02:02:37.783 --> 02:02:38.718
ACTUAL TITLE IS.

02:02:38.784 --> 02:02:42.888
BUT IS THERE NOT AN OPPORTUNITY

02:02:42.955 --> 02:02:44.156
HERE.

02:02:44.223 --> 02:02:45.791
FOR LEGISLATION TO BE AMENDED

02:02:45.858 --> 02:02:48.294
THAT WOULD MANDATE -- THE

02:02:48.360 --> 02:02:50.262
APPLICATION IMPLEMENTATION OF

02:02:50.329 --> 02:02:54.033
THE STANDARDS IN SUCH A WAY THAT --

02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:56.368
WOULD SATISFY THE CONCERNS OR

02:02:56.435 --> 02:02:58.003
MOST OF THE CONCERNS RAISED.

02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:59.238
ABOUT.

02:02:59.305 --> 02:03:00.806
THE IN HUMANE TREATMENT OF

02:03:00.873 --> 02:03:05.745
ANIMALS. TO ME I'LL SERVICE.

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:08.147
THE ANSWER IF I MAY.

02:03:08.214 --> 02:03:09.215
THANK YOU SO THE THE FIRST

02:03:09.281 --> 02:03:10.916
ANSWER THE QUESTION IS IS YES

02:03:10.983 --> 02:03:12.084
THIS PROGRAM HAS A BIT BEEN

02:03:12.151 --> 02:03:13.052
DEVELOPED OVER THE COURSE OF

02:03:13.119 --> 02:03:14.587
LAST FOR FIVE YEARS AGAIN WITH

02:03:14.653 --> 02:03:16.088
THE MAJOR BRANDS OF THE TABLE.

02:03:16.155 --> 02:03:17.123
USING CURRENT INTERNATIONAL

02:03:17.189 --> 02:03:18.657
STANDARDS BASED ON VETERINARY

02:03:18.724 --> 02:03:20.025
SCIENCE IN THE TOOLS AVAILABLE

02:03:20.092 --> 02:03:21.293
TO US TODAY AND THOSE ARE

02:03:21.360 --> 02:03:22.695
CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AND THE

02:03:22.762 --> 02:03:23.629
CONCEPT IS THAT THE

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:25.064
CERTIFICATION PROGRAM WOULD BE

02:03:25.131 --> 02:03:27.933
SIMILARLY CONTINUALLY EVOLVING --

02:03:28.000 --> 02:03:29.168
THE FOR THE THIRD PARTY

02:03:29.235 --> 02:03:30.236
INDEPENDENT MONITORING AS I SAID

02:03:30.302 --> 02:03:31.470
IS THE SAME PROGRAM THAT IS IN

02:03:31.537 --> 02:03:32.838
PLACE FOR THE CATTLE INDUSTRY

02:03:32.905 --> 02:03:33.839
THIS ACCEPTED.

02:03:33.906 --> 02:03:35.641
PRETTY UNIVERSALLY AND IT IT

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:37.276
USES BLOCKCHAIN TECHNOLOGY SO

02:03:37.343 --> 02:03:39.044
THAT THE PELTS OF A YOU GO TO

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:40.446
BUY GARMENT AND THAT G

02:03:40.513 --> 02:03:41.714
DE UP OF A NUMBER OF PELTS

02:03:41.781 --> 02:03:43.415
EVERYONE WILL HAVE A BAR CODE.

02:03:52.158 --> 02:03:55.594
BY THE WAY USES -- IF THE DOES

02:03:55.661 --> 02:03:57.096
NOT USE THE CHEMICALS THEY SAY

02:03:57.163 --> 02:03:58.430
IT DOESN'T USE VEGETABLE DYES SO

02:03:58.497 --> 02:04:00.232
Y THE WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE

02:04:00.299 --> 02:04:03.102
AUTHOR AND FROM OTHERS IS THAT --

02:04:03.169 --> 02:04:04.937
IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FROM --

02:04:05.004 --> 02:04:08.407
THESE THIRD COUNTRIES -- BUT

02:04:08.474 --> 02:04:09.375

02:06:11.263 --> 02:06:14.099
WOULD IT NOT BE MORE HELPFUL.

02:06:14.166 --> 02:06:17.569
TO CREATE A CALIFORNIA -- PIECE

02:06:17.636 --> 02:06:19.872
OF LEGISLATION THAT GIVES MORE

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:20.773
TEETH.

02:06:20.839 --> 02:06:22.741

REGULATIONS TO A BODY THAT

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:27.246
ALREADY EXISTS BECAUSE WHAT I

02:06:27.313 --> 02:06:29.381
HAVE BEEN ALSO HEARD IS.

02:06:29.448 --> 02:06:31.850
WHAT IS THE ECONOMIC IMPACT --

02:06:31.917 --> 02:06:35.120
FOR THIS LEGISLATION ON DOING --

02:06:35.187 --> 02:06:37.723
THIS -- THIS AREA OF SALE --

02:06:37.790 --> 02:06:38.724

ECONOMIC IMPACT ON ON BUSINESSES --

SO WITHOUT KNOWING IN QUAN AND

02:06:45.631 --> 02:06:47.900
HAVING SOMEONE QUANTIFY.

02:06:47.967 --> 02:06:49.301
HOW MANY BUSINESSES MICHAEL

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:50.836
WONDER FOR THIS?

02:06:50.903 --> 02:06:52.805

MISSING MISSING THAT THE BALL

02:06:54.273 --> 02:06:56.308
HERE LOOK IT SEEMS AS IF THERE

02:06:56.375 --> 02:06:59.979
THIS IS A WAY FORWARD -- WITHOUT.

02:07:00.045 --> 02:07:02.314
HAVING OUT RIGHT BAN I CAN

02:07:02.381 --> 02:07:03.482
QUANTIFY THE ECONOMIC STAKE SO

02:07:03.549 --> 02:07:04.817
I'M SORRY WAS THAT A QUESTION

02:07:04.883 --> 02:07:05.651
THE AUTHOR YOU KNOW MAYBE MAYBE

02:07:05.718 --> 02:07:07.953
MAYBE IT'S NOT I JUST I THINK I

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:10.356
THINK -- IF THE EXAMPLES THAT

02:07:10.422 --> 02:07:11.423
AND I'M LEARNING ABOUT THIS I

02:07:11.490 --> 02:07:12.558
DON'T KNOW TOO MUCH ABOUT THE

02:07:12.624 --> 02:07:13.692
THAT THE TREATMENT OF THESE

02:07:13.759 --> 02:07:15.728
ANIMALS BUT IF IT IS BAD AS IT

02:07:15.794 --> 02:07:16.729
SOUNDS.

02:07:16.795 --> 02:07:18.397
AND THERE IS A REGULATORY

02:07:18.464 --> 02:07:20.733
FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT NEEDS TO

02:07:20.799 --> 02:07:23.702
BE REVAMPED OR MADE MORE ROBUST.

02:07:23.769 --> 02:07:25.104
THAT COULD BE A WAY FORWARD

02:07:25.170 --> 02:07:27.373
WITHOUT COMPLETELY ON DOING AN

02:07:27.439 --> 02:07:28.607
INDUSTRY.

02:07:28.674 --> 02:07:30.476
IT DOESN'T SHE AND I AM DOUBTFUL

02:07:30.542 --> 02:07:31.276
THAT IT WOULD ACHIEVE THE

02:07:31.343 --> 02:07:33.579
RESULTS THAT EVERYONE WANTS IF

02:07:33.645 --> 02:07:35.080
THEY REALLY CAN'T GO TO ARIZONA

02:07:35.147 --> 02:07:36.615

02:07:36.682 --> 02:07:38.917
AND PURCHASE THE SAME GOODS --

02:07:38.984 --> 02:07:39.885

BUSINESSES OUT OF CALIFORNIA BUT

02:07:41.587 --> 02:07:44.223
NOT THE ACTUAL TRIP -- END USER

02:07:44.289 --> 02:07:45.491
LET ME JUST -- ALL THIS QUICKLY

02:07:45.557 --> 02:07:46.658
SAY TWO THINGS FIRST OF ALL

02:07:46.725 --> 02:07:47.659
THEY'RE NOT OFFERING A

02:07:47.726 --> 02:07:49.061
CERTIFICATION THAT GIVES US

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:50.996
CONFIDENCE THAT THESE ANIMALS

02:07:51.063 --> 02:07:53.032
WILL BE RAISED OR SLAUGHTERED

02:07:53.098 --> 02:07:54.433
CRUELTY FREE AND I'M NOT SURE

02:07:54.500 --> 02:07:55.968
THAT THE FURNITURE CAN'T DO THAT

02:07:56.035 --> 02:07:56.735
OR IS PREPARED.

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:58.504
EVEN PUT THAT ON THE TABLE SO

02:07:58.570 --> 02:07:59.838

RUNNING AROUND GRIFFITH PARK BUT

02:26:24.208 --> 02:26:25.409
IF YOU ASK THOSE SAME PEOPLE

WHERE THAT PICTURE WAS PAINTED

02:26:31.249 --> 02:26:32.650
THEY HAVE NO IDEA BECAUSE WE

WORK ON THIS -- YOU MIGHT

CONSIDER SO TO TAX THAT WOULD

02:26:47.165 --> 02:26:49.567
GENERATE A LOT OF REVENUES.

02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:50.735
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA WE WOULD

02:26:50.801 --> 02:26:52.837

THANK YOU.

02:27:01.646 --> 02:27:02.280
THE END WITH THAT I I WOULD SAY --

02:27:02.346 --> 02:27:03.714
I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU NOT DO

02:27:03.781 --> 02:27:05.316
THAT RIGHT NOW.

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:07.485
I I ACTUALLY HAVE -- TWO ISSUES

02:27:07.552 --> 02:27:09.387
I I KIND OF SAW THIS A LITTLE

02:27:09.453 --> 02:27:10.154
BIT DIFFERENTLY THAN THE

02:27:10.221 --> 02:27:11.822
CONVERSATION IS GOING AND I

02:27:11.889 --> 02:27:13.724
APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING -- SOME OF

02:27:13.791 --> 02:27:16.460
THE TESTIMONY BUT THIS I SEE

02:27:16.527 --> 02:27:18.462
THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT ROLE

02:27:18.529 --> 02:27:20.331
ECONOMIC.

02:27:20.398 --> 02:27:23.901
OPPORTUNITY BILL AND WHEN I WAS

02:27:23.968 --> 02:27:25.002
IN THE ASSEMBLY AND I HAD A

02:27:25.069 --> 02:27:26.637
SELECT COMMITTEE ON ECONOMIC

02:27:26.704 --> 02:27:28.339
DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENT ROW

02:27:28.406 --> 02:27:29.173
CALIFORNIA I THOUGHT WE'D BE

02:27:29.240 --> 02:27:32.176
LOOKING AT TOURISM.

02:27:32.243 --> 02:27:33.678
NOT BECAUSE TERRACE.

02:27:33.744 --> 02:27:34.779
COMMON THEY SPEND MONEY AND THEY

02:27:34.845 --> 02:27:36.314
GO AWAY AND THEY NORMALLY DON'T

02:27:36.380 --> 02:27:37.515
CAUSE ANY PROBLEMS AND THAT'S

02:27:37.582 --> 02:27:37.982
WHAT.

02:27:38.049 --> 02:27:40.284
REALLY -- SMALL GROW COMMUNITIES

02:27:40.351 --> 02:27:43.087
NEED DESPERATELY NEED -- AND I

02:27:43.154 --> 02:27:44.855
IN THE SENATE DISTRICT HAVE ONE

02:27:44.922 --> 02:27:46.457
OF THE LARGEST WETLANDS IN THE

02:27:46.524 --> 02:27:49.160
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND IT'S IT

02:27:49.227 --> 02:27:51.729
IS A COMBINATION OF FEDERAL

02:27:51.796 --> 02:27:53.631
STATE AND PRIVATE LANDS.

02:27:53.698 --> 02:27:55.032
AND YOU WOULDN'T KNOW IT

02:27:55.099 --> 02:27:57.702
TRAVELING ON I..

02:27:57.768 --> 02:27:59.637
FIVE GOING FROM LA TO WHEREVER

02:27:59.704 --> 02:28:01.772
YOU'RE GOING SO -- SO I REALLY

02:28:01.839 --> 02:28:04.375
THINK THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT --

02:28:04.442 --> 02:28:06.310
AND THE MORE THAT WE CAN INCLUDE

02:28:06.377 --> 02:28:07.945
LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN SOME OF THE

02:28:08.012 --> 02:28:09.914
DISCUSSIONS SO THAT WE CAN

02:28:09.981 --> 02:28:13.217
IDENTIFY GATEWAYS IDENTIFY STOPS --

02:28:13.284 --> 02:28:14.885
YOU KNOW TEN THINGS YOU CAN DO

02:28:14.952 --> 02:28:17.154
TO SEE -- UP WILDLIFE BACK THOSE

02:28:17.221 --> 02:28:18.556
KINDS OF THINGS WOULD BE

02:28:18.623 --> 02:28:21.993
TERRIFIC BUT ALSO -- SO FACILITY

02:28:22.059 --> 02:28:23.828
SIGNAGE YOU KNOW ACCESS ALL OF

02:28:23.894 --> 02:28:25.529
THAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT I

02:28:25.596 --> 02:28:29.133
ALSO -- THOUGHT THAT IT MIGHT

02:28:29.200 --> 02:28:31.469
MAKE SENSE. TO TO HOUSE IT

02:28:31.535 --> 02:28:32.770
EITHER AGO BIZZARE VISIT

02:28:32.837 --> 02:28:34.472
CALIFORNIA AS OPPOSED TO JUST

02:28:34.538 --> 02:28:35.406
STICKING IT IN THE GOVERNOR'S

02:28:35.473 --> 02:28:37.742
OFFICE THAT IT'S RELATED TO

02:28:37.808 --> 02:28:38.809
SOMETHING THAT IS.

02:28:38.876 --> 02:28:42.280
THAT IS -- ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT --

02:28:42.346 --> 02:28:44.315
BUT IT'S JUST IT'S JUST MY MY

02:28:44.382 --> 02:28:46.183
OPINION A LOT OF TIMES WE WE

02:28:46.250 --> 02:28:47.118
JUST PUT THINGS IN THE

02:28:47.184 --> 02:28:49.353
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND THEN --

02:28:49.420 --> 02:28:51.689
AND BECAUSE IT KIND OF MAKES YOU

02:28:51.756 --> 02:28:53.424
THINK IT'S NEAR AND DEAR TO THE

02:28:53.491 --> 02:28:54.558
GOVERNOR'S HEART BUT BUT

02:28:54.625 --> 02:28:56.093
SOMETIMES I THINK IT IT DOESN'T

02:28:56.160 --> 02:28:57.461
MAKE SENSE TO HOOK IT INTO OTHER

02:28:57.528 --> 02:28:59.664
THINGS THAT ARE GOING ON SUCH AS

02:28:59.730 --> 02:29:00.298
MY TWO CENTS WORTH I THINK IT'S

02:29:00.364 --> 02:29:02.700
AN IT'S A REALLY.

02:29:02.767 --> 02:29:03.834
INTERESTING.

02:29:03.901 --> 02:29:05.369
OPPORTUNITIES TO DO A BUNCH OF

02:29:05.436 --> 02:29:07.605
THINGS AND AND I AM CONCERNED

02:29:07.672 --> 02:29:08.706
THAT ULTIMATELY ABOUT HOW IT'S

02:29:08.773 --> 02:29:10.308
FUNDED BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY

02:29:10.374 --> 02:29:11.809

02:30:08.966 --> 02:30:10.468
GREAT GOAL OF THE BILL IN THE

02:30:10.534 --> 02:30:13.204
OFFICE -- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:30:13.270 --> 02:30:15.272
IS IMPORTANT TO ME YOU MENTIONED

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:33.057
CONCERN WHEN I MET WITH THE

PROPONENTS A COUPLE MONTHS AGO

02:30:34.759 --> 02:30:36.894
I'M ALSO YOU KNOW AN IMPORTANT.

02:30:36.961 --> 02:30:38.596
THING TO ME IS MOTORIZED ACCESS

02:30:38.662 --> 02:30:39.296
AS WELL.

02:30:39.363 --> 02:30:40.398
WHICH I KNOW THAT'S NOT PART OF

02:30:40.464 --> 02:30:43.100
YOUR PROMOTION O THIS -- I DID

02:30:43.167 --> 02:30:45.703
POINT OUT TO THE PROPONENTS THAT

02:30:45.770 --> 02:30:47.772
YOU KNOW THOSE OF US THAT ARE IN

02:30:47.838 --> 02:30:49.507
THE MOTORIZED ACCESS ALSO SPEND

02:30:49.573 --> 02:30:52.576
MONEY AT ARI I A LOT OF IT AND

02:30:52.643 --> 02:30:53.611
OTHER PLACES.

02:30:53.677 --> 02:30:57.581
I TO GET OUR EQUIPMENT SO.

02:30:57.648 --> 02:30:58.249
NOT SO MUCH A CONCERN WITH THIS

02:30:58.315 --> 02:31:01.185
BILL -- BUT MOVING FORWARD WITH

02:31:01.252 --> 02:31:03.554
THE OFFICE IT WOULD BE I I WOULD

02:31:03.621 --> 02:31:05.222
HAVE A PROBLEM IF THE OFFICE

02:31:05.289 --> 02:31:07.224
EVOLVED INTO SOMETHING THAT.

02:31:07.291 --> 02:31:09.193
WAS PROMOTING AND PROTECTING

02:31:09.260 --> 02:31:10.928
HUMAN POWERED ACCESS AT THE

02:31:10.995 --> 02:31:13.964
EXPENSE OF MOTORIZED ACCESS THAT

02:31:14.031 --> 02:31:15.800
WOULD AND I THINK THAT THOSE TWO

02:31:15.866 --> 02:31:17.001
THINGS CAN LIVE.

02:31:17.067 --> 02:31:21.205
IN HARMONY -- THEY DO NOW AND SO

02:31:21.272 --> 02:31:22.373
I'M JUST REYES AS A CONCERN

02:31:22.440 --> 02:31:24.308
MOVING FORWARD IF THIS BECOMES

02:31:24.375 --> 02:31:26.677
LAW BECOMES A THING -- THAT

02:31:26.744 --> 02:31:27.311
WOULD BE SOMETHING I WOULD BE

02:31:27.378 --> 02:31:29.447
LOOKING OUT FOR AS THE OFFICE

02:31:29.513 --> 02:31:32.583
INVOLVED -- AND BECAUSE I KNOW

02:31:32.650 --> 02:31:34.919
THAT THERE'S YOU KNOW --

02:31:34.985 --> 02:31:37.221
INTEREST GROUPS IN IN CALIFORNIA

02:31:37.288 --> 02:31:38.889
THAT WANT TO ELIMINATE MOTORIZED

02:31:38.956 --> 02:31:40.357
ACCESS A LOT OF AREAS THAT

02:31:40.424 --> 02:31:41.559
ALREADY HAVE IT.

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:43.828
AND THAT WOULD BE SOME THAT

02:31:43.894 --> 02:31:47.164
WOULD BE CONCERN TO ME -- AND

02:31:47.231 --> 02:31:50.134
THEN IT TALKING ABOUT -- FOR

02:31:50.201 --> 02:31:51.168
LACK OF A VERY SPREADING THE USE

02:31:51.235 --> 02:31:57.208
OF OUR OUR PARKS IN CALIFORNIA

02:31:57.274 --> 02:31:58.042
THAT'S A BIG DEAL YOU KNOW WHEN

02:31:58.108 --> 02:32:00.611

02:32:06.684 --> 02:32:08.652
IS AND THEN WE'VE GOT A LOT OF

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:10.888
STATE PARKS THAT ARE -- OVER

02:32:10.955 --> 02:32:12.556

02:32:12.623 --> 02:32:14.525
AT TO THE POINT I THINK ONE WE

02:32:14.592 --> 02:32:15.893
WERE MAKING -- YOU KNOW TEN

02:32:15.960 --> 02:32:17.561

02:36:26.110 --> 02:36:27.578
COLLECTED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS

02:36:27.644 --> 02:36:28.779
STARTING THE LATE.

02:36:28.846 --> 02:36:30.214
AND THEN TWO THOUSAND SIX AND

02:36:30.280 --> 02:36:30.714
THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO BE

02:36:30.781 --> 02:36:32.216
COLLECTED.

02:36:32.282 --> 02:36:33.684
AND USED.

02:36:33.751 --> 02:36:35.586
FOR COASTAL RESOURCES AND THEN

02:36:35.652 --> 02:36:37.254
IT WAS SWEPT IN THE GENERAL FUND

02:36:37.321 --> 02:36:38.322
AND I THINK.

02:36:38.388 --> 02:36:40.023
THAT WOULD BE BETTER SERVED TO

02:36:40.090 --> 02:36:41.091
TAKE SOME OF THOSE REVENUES AND

02:36:41.158 --> 02:36:42.559
MAKE THEM AVAILABLE ALONG THE

02:36:42.626 --> 02:36:44.094
COAST AND SINCE THERE COASTAL

02:36:44.161 --> 02:36:45.662
DERIVE.

02:36:45.729 --> 02:36:46.296
BECOME AVAILABLE IN THE COASTAL

02:36:46.363 --> 02:36:49.166

02:36:49.233 --> 02:36:50.634
BUILDING ON ADAPTATION.

02:36:50.701 --> 02:36:52.035
WE KEEP TALKING ABOUT.

02:36:52.102 --> 02:36:52.903
THE NEED FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE

02:36:52.970 --> 02:36:55.706

02:36:55.773 --> 02:36:57.141
TO ADAPT TO OUR CHANGING CLIMATE.

02:36:57.207 --> 02:36:58.675
BUT THERE WILL NEED TO BE A

02:36:58.742 --> 02:37:00.310
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RESOURCES

02:37:00.377 --> 02:37:01.812

WATER IF YOU WELL.

02:37:06.416 --> 02:37:07.951
OF TAKING A PART OF THOSE

02:37:08.018 --> 02:37:09.453

DISCREPANCIES I'D LIKE TO POINT

02:53:59.195 --> 02:54:01.931
OUT OF THE FIRST THING IS -- WHY

02:54:04.100 --> 02:54:06.302
WHY SHOULD THE JV ID GET

02:54:06.369 --> 02:54:07.603
SUBSIDIZED BY OTHER DAM OWNERS?

02:54:07.670 --> 02:54:09.338
WE FEEL THAT WE ARE SUBSIDIZING

02:54:09.405 --> 02:54:10.940
OTHER DAM OWNERS.

02:54:11.007 --> 02:54:12.275

02:54:23.052 --> 02:54:25.988
DRASTIC DIFFERENCE.

02:54:26.055 --> 02:54:28.191
IN COMPARISON IT TAKES US ABOUT

02:54:28.257 --> 02:54:29.625

02:54:50.479 --> 02:54:52.715
INCREASE THAT'S NOT.

02:54:52.782 --> 02:54:55.151
TO INCLUDED IN THIS ANALYSIS.

02:54:55.218 --> 02:54:56.719
IN MONETIZING OTHER ASSETS WE

02:54:56.786 --> 02:54:59.088

EVERY YEAR BECAUSE THE S. R. D.

02:55:46.502 --> 02:55:48.738

DAM BE BEST TWO THOUSAND FOUR IN.

02:56:40.856 --> 02:56:41.924
AND WE SEEN IT ESCALATE AND WE

02:56:41.991 --> 02:56:43.326
HAD OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO

02:56:43.392 --> 02:56:45.494

02:56:45.561 --> 02:56:47.263
THE DIVISION OF DAM SAFETY THIS

02:56:47.330 --> 02:56:49.432
LAST YEAR.

02:56:49.498 --> 02:56:51.567
WHEN THEY CIRCULATED NEW

02:56:51.634 --> 02:56:53.135
REGULATIONS?

02:56:53.202 --> 02:56:54.470
IN THE DAM SAFETY HAS BEEN UNDER

02:56:54.537 --> 02:56:57.106
SOME PRESSURE TO TRY. TO TO GET

02:56:57.173 --> 02:56:57.340

02:57:07.083 --> 02:57:09.652
THE STATE.

02:57:09.719 --> 02:57:11.988
OUR CONCERN WAS THAT THERE ARE

02:57:12.054 --> 02:57:13.122
THESE TO BE.

02:57:13.189 --> 02:57:15.591
A STRUCTURAL CHANGE IN THE WAY

THOSE FEES ARE CALCULATED.

02:57:17.360 --> 02:57:19.228
IT'S IN STATUE RIGHT NOW THAT

02:57:19.295 --> 02:57:21.397
THEY HAVE TO BE BASED PRIMARILY

02:57:21.464 --> 02:57:22.798
ON HAIFA DAM [inaudible]

02:57:22.865 --> 02:57:26.669
BUT WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO POINT

02:57:26.736 --> 02:57:27.436
OUT TO THE DIVISION OF DAM

02:57:27.503 --> 02:57:28.738
SAFETY IS THAT.

02:57:28.804 --> 02:57:30.773
A LOT OF OTHER THINGS OR IN PLAY

02:57:30.840 --> 02:57:33.242
ON OUGHT TO BE CONSIDERED IN IN

02:57:33.309 --> 02:57:35.344
THE THE STRUCTURE.

02:57:35.411 --> 02:57:37.747
THINGS LIKE DOWNSTREAM RISK.

02:57:37.813 --> 02:57:39.482
THE THE AMOUNT OF WATER IN

02:57:39.548 --> 02:57:41.650
STORAGE AND WHAT IT CAN DO IN

02:57:41.717 --> 02:57:43.986
THE DOWNSTREAM.

02:57:44.053 --> 02:57:45.254
DAMAGE IF THERE WAS A BREACH OF

02:57:45.321 --> 02:57:47.189
THE DAM.

02:57:47.256 --> 02:57:48.724
OUR LITTLE DAM.

02:57:48.791 --> 02:57:50.292
IT WOULD HAVE SOME IMPACT.

02:57:50.359 --> 02:57:52.528
BUT WE'D BE PRETTY MUCH LIMITED

02:57:52.595 --> 02:57:55.731
TO THE OF THE CREEK THAT WE JUST

02:57:55.798 --> 02:57:59.168
CHARGE AND TO AND IT WOULD GET

02:57:59.235 --> 02:58:00.669
DOWN AS FAR AS THE TOWN OF GOLF

02:58:00.736 --> 02:58:02.171
BUT IT WILL BE MOSTLY IN

02:58:02.238 --> 02:58:05.508
AGRICULTURAL AREAS.

02:58:05.574 --> 02:58:07.176
WHICH IS OUR NEXT DOOR NEIGHBOR

02:58:07.243 --> 02:58:08.978
WOULD WIPE OUT LODI WHICH IS A

02:58:09.045 --> 02:58:09.211
PRETTY.

02:58:09.278 --> 02:58:09.979
PRETTY GOOD SIZED TOWN.

02:58:10.046 --> 02:58:12.848
YOU TAKE IT. FOR AVAIL YOU KNOW

02:58:12.915 --> 02:58:14.950
THEY THEY THEY DON'T.

02:58:15.017 --> 02:58:15.751
YEAH THEY'RE THEY'RE FEE IS

02:58:15.818 --> 02:58:17.420
BIGGER THAN OURS BUT NOT BY VERY

02:58:17.486 --> 02:58:20.156
MUCH AND THEY THEIR FEE IS

02:58:20.222 --> 02:58:21.957
BASICALLY ABOUT FIVE CENTS PER

02:58:22.024 --> 02:58:24.660
ACRE FOOT OF WATER IN STORAGE

02:58:24.727 --> 02:58:27.496
AND OURS IS TO SENSE.

02:58:27.563 --> 02:58:29.398
ARCHBISHOP TWO DOLLARS.

02:58:29.465 --> 02:58:30.800
THERE IS A SPICE SENSE OURS IS

02:58:30.866 --> 02:58:31.534
TWO DOLLARS.

02:58:31.600 --> 02:58:33.836
IS ONE OF THE LARGEST CALCULATED

02:58:33.903 --> 02:58:35.771
ON THE ON THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

02:58:35.838 --> 02:58:38.374
WATER IN STORAGE VINNIE'S ANY

02:58:38.441 --> 02:58:39.775
DAMAGE THE STATE.

02:58:39.842 --> 02:58:40.743
BUT WE WANT TO THE DIVISION OF

02:58:40.810 --> 02:58:43.646
OF DAM SAFETY AND POINTED THESE

02:58:43.712 --> 02:58:44.080
THINGS OUT.

02:58:44.146 --> 02:58:45.081
THEY WERE VERY SYMPATHETIC TO

02:58:45.147 --> 02:58:46.582
OUR ARGUMENT.

02:58:46.649 --> 02:58:47.917
BUT THEY WERE IN A POSITION TO

02:58:47.983 --> 02:58:50.553
DO MUCH ABOUT IT.

02:58:50.619 --> 02:58:51.487
BECAUSE OF THE LEGISLATIVE.

02:58:51.554 --> 02:58:54.523
RESTRICTIONS ON I'M.

02:58:54.590 --> 02:58:55.157
ON HOW THINGS ARE CURRENTLY SET

02:58:55.224 --> 02:58:56.358
UP.

02:58:56.425 --> 02:58:58.461
AND THE TRYING TO RE WORKS THE

02:58:58.527 --> 02:59:00.029
ENTIRE.

02:59:00.096 --> 02:59:01.564
SYSTEM.

02:59:01.630 --> 02:59:03.032
IN THE TIME THAT THEY HAD.

02:59:03.099 --> 02:59:04.834
WAS A VERY PRACTICAL AND WOULD

02:59:04.900 --> 02:59:06.869
RESULT IN A LOT OF WINNERS AND

02:59:06.936 --> 02:59:08.204
pLOSERS WHICH THEY DIDN'T WANT TO

02:59:08.270 --> 02:59:09.472
GET INTO.

02:59:09.538 --> 02:59:10.806
SO THEY DIRECTED US TO MISTER

02:59:10.873 --> 02:59:12.775
BIGELOW.

02:59:12.842 --> 02:59:14.577
ED TO TRY TO COME UP WITH

02:59:14.643 --> 02:59:16.645
SOMETHING THAT WOULD WORK.

02:59:16.712 --> 02:59:20.583
AND WE FIRST -- LOOKED AT COMING

02:59:20.649 --> 02:59:22.551
UP WITH A DISADVANTAGED WE WE

02:59:22.618 --> 02:59:23.719
QUALIFY AS A DISADVANTAGED

02:59:23.786 --> 02:59:24.887
COMMUNITY.

02:59:24.954 --> 02:59:28.257
BUT EVEN THAT I HAD A LOT OF

02:59:28.324 --> 02:59:30.793
PROBLEMS -- WERE.

02:59:30.860 --> 02:59:33.062
YOU KNOW THERE'S TALK IS A

02:59:33.129 --> 02:59:34.697
DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN

02:59:34.763 --> 02:59:35.731
JUST ABOUT EVERY COMMUNITY IN

02:59:35.798 --> 02:59:37.199
THE STATE SO IT WOULD BE A

02:59:37.266 --> 02:59:38.968
NIGHTMARE TO TRY TO FIGURE IT

02:59:39.034 --> 02:59:40.669
OUT ON THAT BASIS.

02:59:40.736 --> 02:59:41.504
SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS LITTLE

02:59:41.570 --> 02:59:42.872
CUT OUT OR SMALL IRRIGATION

02:59:42.938 --> 02:59:44.240
DISTRICT.

02:59:44.306 --> 02:59:47.576

EVERYBODY BREATHES A SIGH OF

02:59:53.582 --> 02:59:55.084
RELIEF THAT THIS LOOKS LIKE A

02:59:55.151 --> 02:59:57.520
PRETTY SIMPLE. SIX AND AND

02:59:57.586 --> 02:59:58.053
WOULDN'T COST VERY MUCH TO

02:59:58.120 --> 03:00:00.589
IMPLEMENT.

03:00:00.656 --> 03:00:01.190

WITH A GOOD SOLUTION.

03:00:04.693 --> 03:00:06.095
IT'S VERY MODEST AND AND THE

03:00:06.162 --> 03:00:09.165
IMPACT ON THE ON THE DIVISION

EFFORT.

03:00:18.040 --> 03:00:19.475
AND IT WOULD GIVE US A GREAT

03:00:19.542 --> 03:00:20.943
AMOUNT OF RELEASED AND OTHER

03:00:21.010 --> 03:00:22.144

A SENIOR IRANIAN OPPOSITION.

03:00:38.160 --> 03:00:42.665
A SCENE -- NINE I CAN DIRECTORS

TO YOUR BOARD PRESIDENT YOU'RE

03:00:43.966 --> 03:00:45.334
SITTING RIGHT THERE.

03:00:45.401 --> 03:00:49.505
THE THE CENTRAL CONCERN I HAD --

03:00:49.572 --> 03:00:51.207
WAS EXACTLY THE STRUCTURAL ISSUE

03:00:51.273 --> 03:00:52.875
YOU BROUGHT UP.

03:00:52.942 --> 03:00:53.842
YOU KNOW LOOKING THROUGH THE

03:00:53.909 --> 03:00:56.278
ANALYSIS AND EVEN WITHIN THE

03:00:56.345 --> 03:00:57.813
DOWNSTREAM HAZARD POTENTIAL

03:00:57.880 --> 03:00:59.715
CLASSIFICATIONS RICHARD THOSE

03:00:59.782 --> 03:01:00.482
EXPENSIVE.

03:01:00.549 --> 03:01:02.218
BECAUSE AT LEAST ONE LOSS OF

03:01:02.284 --> 03:01:03.485
HUMAN LIFE.

03:01:03.552 --> 03:01:04.887
THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF

03:01:04.954 --> 03:01:06.989
VARIABILITY -- AND I RECOGNIZE

03:01:07.056 --> 03:01:11.961
THAT IT'S TRICKY TO REWORK THAT

03:01:12.027 --> 03:01:13.262
WITHOUT WINNERS AND LOSERS BUT

03:01:13.329 --> 03:01:15.431
ON PRINCIPLE I DO HAVE CONCERNS

03:01:15.497 --> 03:01:16.198
ABOUT.

03:01:16.265 --> 03:01:17.933
THIS SORT OF NARROW CUT OUT

03:01:18.000 --> 03:01:19.635
REGARDLESS HOW NARROW IT IS AND

03:01:19.702 --> 03:01:20.803
I I KNOW YOU REALIZE THAT.

03:01:20.869 --> 03:01:24.039
YOU ALL THIS IS A BIG DEAL BUT

03:01:24.106 --> 03:01:25.507
THE CONCERN THAT I'VE I'VE GOT

03:01:25.574 --> 03:01:27.243
LOOKING THROUGH THE THEBROADER

03:01:27.309 --> 03:01:27.443
LIST.

03:01:27.509 --> 03:01:29.612
IS.

03:01:29.678 --> 03:01:30.746
EVEN LIKE THE DSO D. COMPARISON

03:01:30.813 --> 03:01:32.748
FEET TABLE.

03:01:32.815 --> 03:01:34.516
YOU GO TO LA ALL THESE LA COUNTY

03:01:34.583 --> 03:01:36.318
PUBLIC WORKS ARE DOWN THE CITY

03:01:36.385 --> 03:01:37.720
OF SAN DIEGO.

03:01:37.786 --> 03:01:38.854
I'M.

03:01:38.921 --> 03:01:41.257
HIGHER FEES A HIGHER DOLLAR FEE

03:01:41.323 --> 03:01:42.591
PER ACRE FOOT.

03:01:42.658 --> 03:01:44.193
HOW DO YOU MANAGE THAT ISSUE

03:01:44.260 --> 03:01:46.362
SOME CAN HAVE MORE FINANCIAL

03:01:46.428 --> 03:01:47.396
CAPACITY SOME DON'T?

03:01:47.463 --> 03:01:48.530
SEE THE INSIDE BY THE WHEN

03:01:48.597 --> 03:01:50.633
YOU'RE TWENTY FOURTEEN RATE

03:01:50.699 --> 03:01:52.268
INCREASE AND THAT.

03:01:52.334 --> 03:01:54.937
THOSE ARE HARD POLITICS I AM

03:01:55.004 --> 03:01:56.372
WELL AWARE THAT.

03:01:56.438 --> 03:01:57.873
MY RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO

03:01:57.940 --> 03:02:01.710
WORK WITH US -- ON WHAT THAT

03:02:01.777 --> 03:02:03.512
STRUCTURAL REFORM MIGHT ACTUALLY

03:02:03.579 --> 03:02:04.813
ENTAIL.

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:06.682
BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME

03:02:06.749 --> 03:02:09.318
SOUND ARGUMENTS THERE -- BUT AS

03:02:09.385 --> 03:02:10.986
A MATTER OF SORT OF JUST GENERAL

03:02:11.053 --> 03:02:12.288
POLICY.

03:02:12.354 --> 03:02:14.823
STRUGGLING WITH -- JUST PULL IN

03:02:14.890 --> 03:02:16.625
ONE PIECE OUT BECAUSE FIRST IT'S

03:02:16.692 --> 03:02:18.327
YOU ALL MEN AND SOMEONE ELSE AND

03:02:18.394 --> 03:02:20.062
WE ALREADY HELD THE FLOOR A BILL

03:02:20.129 --> 03:02:22.164
THAT WAS TANGENTIALLY RELATED

03:02:22.231 --> 03:02:24.333
BUT THAT THAT'S THAT'S THE

03:02:24.400 --> 03:02:26.802
CONCERN AND SO I DON'T KNOW WHAT

03:02:26.869 --> 03:02:28.304
THE OPENNESS OF THE AUTHOR IS OR

03:02:28.370 --> 03:02:29.471
YOUR OR YOUR SPONSORS HERE.

03:02:29.538 --> 03:02:32.207
BUT I I DON'T MEAN THIS TO BE A

03:02:32.274 --> 03:02:33.742
FALSE PROMISE I I REALLY WOULD

03:02:33.809 --> 03:02:35.244
BE WILLING TO WORK WITH YOU ALL

03:02:35.311 --> 03:02:36.111
IF YOU DID WANT.

TO PULL THE TODAY AND WORK ON

03:02:37.913 --> 03:02:39.181
THIS IT TO YOUR BILL AND

03:02:39.248 --> 03:02:40.149
ACTUALLY TRY TO GET SOME OF THAT

03:02:40.215 --> 03:02:42.518
STATUTORY STRUCTURAL REFORM WITH

03:02:42.584 --> 03:02:43.619
THE W. R..

03:02:43.686 --> 03:02:45.954
I'M UP FOR DOING THAT WORK BUT I

03:02:46.021 --> 03:02:47.222
I TOTALLY APPRECIATE IF YOU JUST

03:02:47.289 --> 03:02:49.024
WANT TO MAKE TO VOTE AND SEE WE

03:02:49.091 --> 03:02:52.194
LAND -- SO I'LL LEAVE THAT AT

03:02:52.261 --> 03:02:54.396
YOUR DISCRETION.

03:02:54.463 --> 03:02:55.564
CAN I RESPOND.

03:02:55.631 --> 03:02:56.598
PLEASE.

03:02:56.665 --> 03:02:58.767
I THINK IN THE IN THE LONG RUN

03:02:58.834 --> 03:03:00.469
THAT WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO GO.

03:03:00.536 --> 03:03:01.503
WE WE WE WOULD APPRECIATE

03:03:01.570 --> 03:03:02.905
BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN WE'VE BEEN

03:03:02.971 --> 03:03:04.807
THINKING ABOUT THIS PROBLEM FOR

03:03:04.873 --> 03:03:07.142
OVER TEN YEARS NOW AND AND

03:03:07.209 --> 03:03:09.211
WORRIED ABOUT THE LONG TERM

03:03:09.278 --> 03:03:11.814
IMPLICATIONS ON OUR BUDGET.

03:03:11.880 --> 03:03:13.115
IN THIS YEAR ALONE YOU KNOW IT

03:03:13.182 --> 03:03:14.950
THAT THAT BE HAS CONSUMED.

03:03:15.017 --> 03:03:17.486
THIRD OF OUR OUR TOTAL WATER

03:03:17.553 --> 03:03:19.588
SALES REVENUE.

03:03:19.655 --> 03:03:21.623
THIS IS A BIG DEAL TO IT AND

03:03:21.690 --> 03:03:22.891
THEN WE DON'T WANT THE MOMENT

03:03:22.958 --> 03:03:25.127
THE PAST.

03:03:25.194 --> 03:03:27.229
IF WE COULD IF.

03:03:27.296 --> 03:03:27.863
THERE'S TWO WAYS TO GO HERE ONE

03:03:27.930 --> 03:03:28.297
IS.

03:03:28.364 --> 03:03:29.598
THAT BACK AND TRY TO WORK THIS

03:03:29.665 --> 03:03:31.133
THING THROUGH TO YOUR BILL AND

03:03:31.200 --> 03:03:32.334
GET SOME REAL.

03:03:32.401 --> 03:03:35.003
CHANGES IN IN THE WORKS.

03:03:35.070 --> 03:03:36.071
ON THE WHOLE DAY TO THE STATE

03:03:36.138 --> 03:03:37.773
ALTHOUGH.

03:03:37.840 --> 03:03:38.841
YOU KNOW AS I SAID IS THERE'S A

03:03:38.907 --> 03:03:41.610
LOT OF POLITICS IN THAT.

03:03:41.677 --> 03:03:43.379
THERE'S A LOT OF ECONOMICS AND

03:03:43.445 --> 03:03:45.447
ANOTHER WAY TO APPROACH IT WOULD

03:03:45.514 --> 03:03:47.883
BE TO GO AHEAD AND CREATORS

03:03:47.950 --> 03:03:48.384
DON'T CUT OUT RIGHT NOW

03:03:48.450 --> 03:03:48.684
[inaudible]

03:03:48.751 --> 03:03:51.320
IN.

03:03:51.387 --> 03:03:52.521
REPLACE IT YOU KNOW WHAT THE

03:03:52.588 --> 03:03:54.757
BEST A BROADER.

03:03:54.823 --> 03:03:56.325
CHANGED LATER ON AS WE GET

03:03:56.392 --> 03:03:59.228
THROUGH THE PROCESS. FOR US THAT

03:03:59.294 --> 03:04:00.562
WOULD BE PREFERABLE BECAUSE

03:04:00.629 --> 03:04:02.664
WE'RE WE'RE SUFFERING

03:04:02.731 --> 03:04:04.099
ECONOMICALLY FOR THIS AND WE WE

03:04:04.166 --> 03:04:05.267
HAVE A VERY SMALL BUDGET WE ONLY

03:04:05.334 --> 03:04:06.735
HAVE A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR A

03:04:06.802 --> 03:04:08.871
YEAR BUDGET.

03:04:08.937 --> 03:04:10.005
WE'VE SPENT.

03:04:10.072 --> 03:04:11.740
ALMOST A HALF A MILLION DOLLARS

03:04:11.807 --> 03:04:13.675
JUST IN THE LAST FIVE YEARS ON

03:04:13.742 --> 03:04:16.912
ALL THE STUDIES AND SIX UPS AND

MECHANISM AND WITH THE GRADUAL

03:36:28.909 --> 03:36:30.110
APPROACH COMPLAINTS BE MORE

03:36:30.177 --> 03:36:31.511

EITHER ONCE OR TWICE A YEAR TO

03:39:18.879 --> 03:39:20.413

03:39:28.421 --> 03:39:29.990
A LOT EASIER. FOR THEM SO THEY

03:39:30.056 --> 03:39:31.291
SHOULD BE AN EXCUSE FOR SORT OF

03:39:31.358 --> 03:39:34.127
ACCIDENTALLY MISSING ONE OF YOUR

03:39:34.194 --> 03:39:36.663

03:39:36.730 --> 03:39:38.398
THANKS THAT -- I WOULD ENTERTAIN

03:39:38.465 --> 03:39:39.633

ONE VERY GOOD YOU HAVE A MOTION --

03:39:49.943 --> 03:39:53.914
WILL MOVE ON THE FIFTEEN AB.

03:39:53.980 --> 03:39:54.714
FIFTEEN SIXTEEN YES YOU MEMBERS

03:39:54.781 --> 03:39:56.516
I'M NOT GOING TO GO INTO DETAIL

03:39:56.583 --> 03:39:58.418
ABOUT THE WILDFIRE CRISIS THAT

03:39:58.485 --> 03:40:00.754
WE'RE HAVING AND HOW -- DRASTIC

03:40:00.820 --> 03:40:02.255
ELEMENTS BE COMMON I'M SURE

03:40:02.322 --> 03:40:02.889
YOU'VE HEARD A LOT OF BILLS IN

03:40:02.956 --> 03:40:05.892
THIS AREA I WILL JUST SAY THAT

03:40:05.959 --> 03:40:08.361
ONE OF THE POINTS OF LEARNING

03:40:08.428 --> 03:40:09.596
THAT'S COME OUT OF THE MORE

03:40:09.663 --> 03:40:10.830
RECENT WILDFIRES.

03:40:10.897 --> 03:40:12.999
WHERE WE'VE HAD NEWER BUILDINGS

03:40:13.066 --> 03:40:14.734
THAT HAVE TODAY'S CODES

03:40:14.801 --> 03:40:16.770
INSTITUTED WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

03:40:16.836 --> 03:40:19.139
THAT HAVING OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE

03:40:19.205 --> 03:40:22.108
RIGHT CLOSE TO A STRUCTURE MAKES?

03:40:22.175 --> 03:40:23.743
IN TERMS OF WHETHER OR NOT THAT

03:40:23.810 --> 03:40:24.778
STRUCTURE SURVIVES.

03:40:24.844 --> 03:40:26.513
I'M I COULD SHOW YOU SLIDE AFTER

03:40:26.580 --> 03:40:28.214
SLIDE OF PROPERTIES WERE RATHER

03:40:28.281 --> 03:40:29.583
THAN SORT OF A WALL OF FIRE

03:40:29.649 --> 03:40:31.017
MOVING THROUGH.

03:40:31.084 --> 03:40:32.819
YOU HAVE AN ENTIRE YARD THAT

03:40:32.886 --> 03:40:35.155
DIDN'T BURN TREES ARE INTACT

03:40:35.221 --> 03:40:36.790
GRASSES ARE INTACT.

03:40:36.856 --> 03:40:38.725
THE YARD WAS FINE BECAUSE AN

03:40:38.792 --> 03:40:40.560
AMBER HIT -- SOMETHING THAT WAS

03:40:40.627 --> 03:40:42.262
FLAMMABLE RIGHT NEXT TO A

03:40:42.329 --> 03:40:44.464
BUILDING THE BUILDING WAS LOST

03:40:44.531 --> 03:40:48.335
SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS CREATE

03:40:48.401 --> 03:40:49.502
A NEW.

03:40:49.569 --> 03:40:51.071
DEFENSIBLE SPACE REQUIREMENT IN

03:40:51.137 --> 03:40:52.472
HIGH FIRE SEVERITY ZONES OF ZERO

03:40:52.539 --> 03:40:54.507
TO FIVE FEET THIS IS NOT EXIST

03:40:54.574 --> 03:40:56.076
RIGHT NOW IN OUR CURRENT CODES

03:40:56.142 --> 03:40:57.677
BUT WORKING WITH CAL FIRE AND

03:40:57.744 --> 03:40:59.179
FOR OUR FIRE AGENCIES ACROSS THE

03:40:59.245 --> 03:40:59.713
STATE.

03:40:59.779 --> 03:41:00.747
THEY HAVE SAID THAT THIS IS

03:41:00.814 --> 03:41:01.915
ACTUALLY PROBABLY THE MOST

03:41:01.982 --> 03:41:03.383
IMPORTANT AREA TO HAVE A NON

03:41:03.450 --> 03:41:05.285
COMBUSTIBLE ZONE SO WHAT WE WILL

03:41:05.352 --> 03:41:07.187
DO IS MOVE FORWARD TO CREATE

03:41:07.253 --> 03:41:08.321
THIS NEW ZONE.

03:41:08.388 --> 03:41:10.523
AND THEN HAVE CAL FIRE WORK TO

03:41:10.590 --> 03:41:12.792
COME UP WITH SORT OF A GUIDELINE

03:41:12.859 --> 03:41:13.693
FOR COMMUNITIES IN HIGH FIRE

03:41:13.760 --> 03:41:14.661
ZONES TO SAY.

03:41:14.728 --> 03:41:16.262
WHAT REALLY WE SHOULD BE GUIDING

03:41:16.329 --> 03:41:17.931
PEOPLE TO DO MAYBE THERE IS SOME

03:41:17.998 --> 03:41:20.100
PLANTING THAT'S ALLOWABLE BUT

03:41:20.166 --> 03:41:21.167
YOU KNOW DON'T COVER YOUR HOUSE

03:41:21.234 --> 03:41:22.168
OF BOOKMOBILE USER VINES DON'T

03:41:22.235 --> 03:41:23.003
PLANT THE REDWOOD RIGHT UP

03:41:23.069 --> 03:41:24.337
AGAINST YOUR STRUCTURE I HAD A

03:41:24.404 --> 03:41:25.171
RED WITH THAT WENT THROUGH MY

03:41:25.238 --> 03:41:25.472
DECK?

03:41:25.538 --> 03:41:27.741
NOT A GOOD IDEA SO WE WANT TO

03:41:27.807 --> 03:41:29.009
CHANGE THAT AND REALLY PUSH OUR

03:41:29.075 --> 03:41:30.076
COMMUNITIES AND WORK WITH OUR

03:41:30.143 --> 03:41:31.811
COMMUNITIES TO GET COMPLIANCE

03:41:31.878 --> 03:41:33.113
ACROSS THE WHOLE COMMUNITY

03:41:33.179 --> 03:41:34.748
BECAUSE ONE OUT OF COMPLIANCE

03:41:34.814 --> 03:41:36.216
HOUSE CAN LEAD TO LOSING AN

03:41:36.282 --> 03:41:37.517
ENTIRE NEIGHBORHOOD OF THAT

03:41:37.584 --> 03:41:38.485
BUILDING GOES UP.

03:41:38.551 --> 03:41:42.022
IN SMOKE -- IS SO -- WE WILL

03:41:42.088 --> 03:41:43.123
WORK TO HAVE THE RIGHT TREE

03:41:43.189 --> 03:41:44.557
RIGHT PLACE PLANTING UNDER

03:41:44.624 --> 03:41:46.593
ELECTRICAL LINES AS ALSO AS PART

03:41:46.660 --> 03:41:48.361
OF THIS BILL AND A GUIDE BOOK TO

03:41:48.428 --> 03:41:49.796
PROVIDE LANDOWNERS OPTIONS FOR

03:41:49.863 --> 03:41:51.031
VEGETATION THAT WON'T GROW INTO

03:41:51.097 --> 03:41:52.766
ENERGIZED CONDUCTOR SO THERE'S A

03:41:52.832 --> 03:41:54.067
PART OF THE BILL.

03:41:54.134 --> 03:41:55.635
IT ALSO DEALS WITH THE WITH THE

03:41:55.702 --> 03:41:56.236
POWER LINES.

03:41:56.302 --> 03:41:57.404
ON THE FARM BUREAU WOULD LIKE

03:41:57.470 --> 03:41:59.272
SPECIAL CONSIDERATION BEING

03:41:59.339 --> 03:42:00.974
GIVEN -- TO GATED FUTURE NOT

03:42:01.041 --> 03:42:02.075
ORCHARDS AND PART OF THE BILL.

03:42:02.142 --> 03:42:03.143
AND I DO THINK THAT THAT

03:42:03.209 --> 03:42:04.277
DESERVES SPECIAL CONSIDERATION

03:42:04.344 --> 03:42:05.178
BECAUSE THOSE ARE IRRIGATED

03:42:05.245 --> 03:42:06.046
THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEY HAVE A

03:42:06.112 --> 03:42:07.947
DIFFERENT KIND OF FIRE RISK AND

03:42:08.014 --> 03:42:09.616
SOMEONE WHO SPIRALING FIRE WOULD

03:42:09.683 --> 03:42:11.151
A YOU KNOW UNDER THEIR STARES

03:42:11.217 --> 03:42:13.386
FOR INSTANCE -- EVER WORKING ON

SO I AM HERE TODAY TO TALK TO A

03:44:09.435 --> 03:44:11.271
LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MOST RECENT

03:44:11.337 --> 03:44:13.006
AMENDMENTS THE RISK MODEL AND

03:44:13.072 --> 03:44:14.274
SUBSEQUENT RISK MAPS

03:44:14.340 --> 03:44:15.675

INFORMATIONAL HEARING THIS

03:44:18.111 --> 03:44:19.078
SPRING.

03:44:19.145 --> 03:44:20.880
THAT THERE WAS A GAP.

03:44:20.947 --> 03:44:23.483

CONSTRUCT A RISK MODEL. FOR THE

03:44:26.219 --> 03:44:27.821
STATE AND THAT'S CRITICAL

03:44:27.887 --> 03:44:29.556
BECAUSE FIRE HAZARD SEVERITIES

03:44:29.622 --> 03:44:31.691
OWN MAPPING AND MODEL THAT WE

03:44:31.758 --> 03:44:32.892
CURRENTLY USED TO DETECT ARE

03:44:32.959 --> 03:44:35.094
WILD FIRE HAZARD IS GREAT BUT IT

03:44:35.161 --> 03:44:41.134
IS NOT DESIGNED TO SERVE.

03:44:41.201 --> 03:44:43.136

WE NEED A TOOL TO BE ABLE TO

03:44:48.274 --> 03:44:49.375
METRIC WHAT THAT RISK

03:44:49.442 --> 03:44:52.345
EFFECTIVENESS IS ARE WE CHANGING

03:44:52.412 --> 03:44:54.280
OUR RISK ARE WE BUYING DOWN RISK.

03:44:54.347 --> 03:44:56.216
PUBLICALLY VETTED MODEL DONE

03:44:56.282 --> 03:44:57.851
THROUGH STATE AGENCY WILL GIVE

03:44:57.917 --> 03:45:00.186
US A COMMON BASIS BY WHICH TO

03:45:00.253 --> 03:45:01.821
EVALUATE THAT RISK.

03:45:01.888 --> 03:45:03.256
THAT EXPENDITURE THERE OR HAVING

AND TELL US OVER THE YEARS AHEAD

03:45:04.657 --> 03:45:05.825
WHETHER WE ARE ACHIEVING THE

03:45:05.892 --> 03:45:07.694
EFFECTIVENESS THAT WE WANT

03:45:07.760 --> 03:45:09.195
SHOULD WE NOT ENACT.

03:45:09.262 --> 03:45:11.097
THIS TYPE OF PROVISION SHOULD WE

03:45:11.164 --> 03:45:12.298
NOT HAVE A PUBLICALLY VETTED

03:45:12.365 --> 03:45:14.100
RISK MODEL IT WILL FALL TO THE

03:45:14.167 --> 03:45:15.802
MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PRIVATE

03:45:15.869 --> 03:45:16.269
MODELS.

03:45:16.336 --> 03:45:17.570
EACH INDEPENDENT LOCAL

03:45:17.637 --> 03:45:20.039

THERE AND THEN WE WILL START

03:45:23.176 --> 03:45:24.510
ARGUING ABOUT WHAT THE MODEL

03:45:24.577 --> 03:45:27.914
VALIDITY IS NOT WHETHER THE

I'M JUST CONCERNED THAT.

03:50:22.375 --> 03:50:23.376

OPPOSED TO SORT OF HAVING A

03:50:35.821 --> 03:50:37.857
MULTI YEAR PROCESS MISTER ROEMER

03:50:37.924 --> 03:50:39.292
AT ANY AYE AYE ANDERSON THE CODE

03:50:39.358 --> 03:50:40.993
PROCESS.

03:50:41.060 --> 03:50:42.628
TAKES A WHILE TO DEVELOP A JUST.

03:50:42.695 --> 03:50:44.497
MEANINGFUL DATA THE BILL TO GET

03:50:44.564 --> 03:50:46.299
TO THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY TO

03:50:46.365 --> 03:50:48.734
REALTORS AND THE FIVE FOOT

03:50:48.801 --> 03:50:49.335
CLEARANCE WERE ALREADY WORKING

03:50:49.402 --> 03:50:50.603
ON THAT -- THERE'S A THERE'S A

03:50:50.670 --> 03:50:52.205
THERE'S A WILD AND URBAN TASK

03:50:52.271 --> 03:50:53.873
FORCE THAT'S BEEN IN STE IN

03:50:53.940 --> 03:50:55.975
PROCESS BLAST DECADE.

03:50:56.042 --> 03:50:56.909
ALREADY WORKING ON THE FIVE PUT

03:50:56.976 --> 03:50:58.277
PRIMER AFTER SEEING THE BILL

03:50:58.344 --> 03:51:01.380
EXCELLENT THANK YOU THAT'S SOME

03:51:01.447 --> 03:51:02.348
GOOD NEWS.

I'D BE HAPPY TO GIVE YOU MY

03:51:02.982 --> 03:51:04.050
ESTIMATE ON WHAT IT WILL TAKE

03:51:04.116 --> 03:51:05.318
YEARS WEISS I DO THINK IT WILL

03:51:05.384 --> 03:51:06.686
TAKE TWO YEARS TO DEVELOP THE

03:51:06.752 --> 03:51:07.687
MODEL.

03:51:07.753 --> 03:51:09.255
AND THREE YEARS FOR A RIGOROUS

03:51:09.322 --> 03:51:11.457
DATA COLLECTION PROCESS SOME OF

03:51:11.524 --> 03:51:12.091
WHICH CAN BE PURCHASED AHEAD OF

03:51:12.158 --> 03:51:12.925
TIME.

03:51:12.992 --> 03:51:14.260
AND THAT GETS THINGS JUMPSTARTED

03:51:14.327 --> 03:51:15.094
BUT I DO THINK THAT

03:51:15.161 --> 03:51:16.596
REALISTICALLY IT WILL TAKE FIVE

03:51:16.662 --> 03:51:19.198
TO GET IT. TO GET REAL METRICS

03:51:19.265 --> 03:51:20.266
BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE IT IS

03:51:20.333 --> 03:51:21.734
REALLY.

03:51:21.801 --> 03:51:23.369
AS AS REALISTIC AS I CAN GIVE

03:51:23.436 --> 03:51:25.304
YOU MAYBE IT'S NOT GREAT.

03:51:25.371 --> 03:51:26.706
SO IT'S CONCERNING BECAUSE IN

03:51:26.772 --> 03:51:27.273
THE NEXT TWO OR THREE YEARS

03:51:27.340 --> 03:51:28.441

03:51:28.507 --> 03:51:30.776
CANCELED OR YOU ACTUALLY.

03:51:30.843 --> 03:51:32.345

THANK GOD A MORTGAGE IS YOU

03:51:33.913 --> 03:51:36.682
DON'T HAVE INSURANCE AND YOU

03:51:36.749 --> 03:51:38.117
HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- WE

03:51:38.184 --> 03:51:38.684
HAVE A HOUSING CRISIS ON OUR

03:51:38.751 --> 03:51:40.253
HANDS I'M JUST.

03:51:40.319 --> 03:51:42.021
IF THERE IF THERE ARE EXPEDITED

03:51:42.088 --> 03:51:44.090
WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE NEAR

03:51:44.156 --> 03:51:47.026
TERM VERY OPEN TO IT I THINK IS

03:51:47.093 --> 03:51:48.894
A GOOD STEP TOWARD BUT JUST WANT

03:51:48.961 --> 03:51:50.162
YOUR FOR THE THINKING ON THAT

03:51:50.229 --> 03:51:52.231
ANOTHER VICE CHAIR AT I WAS JUST

03:51:52.298 --> 03:51:53.165
GONNA SAY THAT'S REALLY AN

03:51:53.232 --> 03:51:55.034
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

03:51:55.101 --> 03:51:56.335
COMMENT THAT YOU MADE AND REALLY

03:51:56.402 --> 03:51:57.770
VERY VERY ASTUTE AND I'M VERY

03:51:57.837 --> 03:51:59.505
PROUD TO ADD YOU AS A CO AUTHOR

SO THANK YOU FOR THAT.

03:52:00.773 --> 03:52:01.941
SO THERE'S YOU KNOW THOSE FEW

03:52:02.008 --> 03:52:02.708
DIFFERENT PIECES HAVING THAT

03:52:02.775 --> 03:52:04.110
RISK ANALYSIS MODEL IS GOING O

03:52:04.176 --> 03:52:04.910
BE VERY IMPORTANT TO

03:52:04.977 --> 03:52:06.812
UNDERSTANDING THE EFFECT OF ALL

03:52:06.879 --> 03:52:07.413
OF OUR RESILIENCY EFFORTS AND

03:52:07.480 --> 03:52:08.247
CERTAINLY.

03:52:08.314 --> 03:52:09.782
WERE A BETTER GUIDE FOR

03:52:09.849 --> 03:52:10.449
HOMEOWNERS WHEN THEIR PURCHASING

03:52:10.516 --> 03:52:12.418
PROPERTY FOR INSURANCE COMPANIES

03:52:12.485 --> 03:52:15.788
WHEN THEY SET RATES ALL OF

03:52:15.855 --> 03:52:16.389
THAT'S IMPORTANT.

03:52:16.455 --> 03:52:18.090
AND OR BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE

03:52:18.157 --> 03:52:18.658
ALSO KNOW THAT THE THIS NEW

03:52:18.724 --> 03:52:19.759
COMBUSTIBLES OWN MAKES A REALLY

03:52:19.825 --> 03:52:21.160
BIG DIFFERENCE SO WE KNOW ABOUT

03:52:21.227 --> 03:52:21.961
ALL OF THE DIFFERENT HOME

03:52:22.028 --> 03:52:22.495
HARDENING.

03:52:22.561 --> 03:52:24.363
I FEEL LIKE WHAT WE HAVE TO

03:52:24.430 --> 03:52:25.097
THINK OF THOSE ON TWO DIFFERENT

03:52:25.164 --> 03:52:26.699
TRACKS AND ONE OF THE THINGS

03:52:26.766 --> 03:52:28.401
THAT I'VE COME TO REALIZE IS

03:52:28.467 --> 03:52:29.368
I'VE GOT MORE IN.

03:52:29.435 --> 03:52:30.836
IN DEPTH IN THIS AREA IS THE

03:52:30.903 --> 03:52:32.505
LACK OF KNOWLEDGE SUCH OUT FOR

03:52:32.571 --> 03:52:34.106
HOMEOWNERS I DID A TOWN HALL A

03:52:34.173 --> 03:52:35.541
COUPLE WEEKS AGO MY DISTRICT OF

03:52:35.608 --> 03:52:36.575
PEOPLE WHO SHOW UP AT THESE TOWN

03:52:36.642 --> 03:52:38.411
HALLS ARE REALLY YOUR MOST

03:52:38.477 --> 03:52:39.011
INVOLVED HOMEOWNERS.

03:52:39.078 --> 03:52:40.546
EASIER H. AWAY PRESIDENT'S THESE

03:52:40.613 --> 03:52:41.714
ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEN AROUND

03:52:41.781 --> 03:52:43.749
FOR A LONG TIME THE INFORMATION

03:52:43.816 --> 03:52:44.884
ABOUT HOME HARDENING THAT WE

03:52:44.950 --> 03:52:45.418
GAVE.

03:52:45.484 --> 03:52:46.952
LIKE FLOOR PEOPLE THEY HAD NO

03:52:47.019 --> 03:52:49.088
IDEA WE HAVE DONE A TERRIBLE JOB

03:52:49.155 --> 03:52:50.790
AND PUSHING HOME HARDENING

03:52:50.856 --> 03:52:53.025
INFORMATION OUT PEOPLE EVEN STOP

03:52:53.092 --> 03:52:53.626
THAT'S PRETTY SIMPLE NO MY

03:52:53.693 --> 03:52:55.061
HUSBAND'S A LANDSCAPE ARCHITECT

03:52:55.127 --> 03:52:57.596
HE HAD NO IDEA ABOUT YOU KNOW.

03:52:57.663 --> 03:52:59.198
THE ABOUT THE AFFECTED SOME OF

03:52:59.265 --> 03:53:00.199
THESE PLANS COULD HAVE ON A

03:53:00.266 --> 03:53:04.303
PROBLEM YOU KNOW ON A HOUSE WHEN

03:53:04.370 --> 03:53:04.937
THEY'RE FOR EVEN FOUR FEET AWAY

03:53:05.004 --> 03:53:06.605
OR PUT.

03:53:06.672 --> 03:53:07.873
EVEN SO WE WE ABSOLUTELY LIKE

03:53:07.940 --> 03:53:08.674
YOU SAID WE SHOULDN'T WASTE ANY

03:53:08.741 --> 03:53:09.375
TIME TO PUSH THAT INFORMATION

03:53:09.442 --> 03:53:10.710
OUT TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:53:10.776 --> 03:53:11.811
COMMUNITIES ARE.

03:53:11.877 --> 03:53:12.745
COMFORTABLE TO ADOPT THIS BILL

03:53:12.812 --> 03:53:13.913
SO WE HAVE THIS NON COMBUSTIBLE

03:53:13.979 --> 03:53:15.348
ZONE AND THEN TO MAKE SURE THAT

03:53:15.414 --> 03:53:17.350
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE QUIPPED TO

03:53:17.416 --> 03:53:18.684
ENFORCE THESE ZONES.

03:53:18.751 --> 03:53:19.285
AND TO WORK WITH THEIR

03:53:19.352 --> 03:53:20.753
COMMUNITIES TO GET COMPLIANCE

03:53:20.820 --> 03:53:22.021
I'M NOT SAYING GO OUT AND START

03:53:22.088 --> 03:53:23.122
FINING PEOPLE I'M SAYING GOING

03:53:23.189 --> 03:53:24.690
OUT TO GO OUT AND IDENTIFY THOSE

03:53:24.757 --> 03:53:27.026
PROPERTIES IN YOUR CITY AND SAY.

03:53:27.093 --> 03:53:28.627
YOU HAVE A REAL SAFETY RISK ON

03:53:28.694 --> 03:53:30.696
YOUR HANDS HOMEOWNER AND HERE'S

03:53:30.763 --> 03:53:32.398
WHAT YOU CAN DO A. B. C. AND D..

03:53:32.465 --> 03:53:33.299
TO FIX THAT SO THAT WE WERE WE

03:53:33.366 --> 03:53:34.867
BUILD UP OUR COMMUNITIES WE WERE

03:53:34.934 --> 03:53:36.235
ABLE TO GET FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

03:53:36.302 --> 03:53:37.970
IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET TO HELP

03:53:38.037 --> 03:53:38.704
WITH THAT DEFENSIBLE SPACE

03:53:38.771 --> 03:53:39.472
REQUIREMENTS.

03:53:39.538 --> 03:53:41.107
THAT'S NOTHING WE COULD SPEND

COUNTY OIL AND GAS STRIKE TEAM.

04:03:56.555 --> 04:03:58.090
AND WE ARE ACTIVELY LOOKING AT

04:03:58.156 --> 04:04:00.292
THE EMISSIONS FROM ABANDONED AND

04:04:00.359 --> 04:04:02.761
IDA WELLS IN THE LOS ANGELES

04:04:02.828 --> 04:04:04.830
AREA. ONE OF THINGS THAT'S CLEAR

04:04:04.896 --> 04:04:05.697
IN THE MISTER HOLDEN THE STATED

04:04:05.764 --> 04:04:06.531
IS THAT THERE ARE TENS OF

04:04:06.598 --> 04:04:07.766
THOUSANDS OF THESE WELLS IN

04:04:07.833 --> 04:04:08.633
CALIFORNIA.

04:04:08.700 --> 04:04:12.037
AND IT IS IT IS ARE BASED ON

04:04:12.104 --> 04:04:13.638
SCIENCE THAT WE CAN SAY THAT

04:04:13.705 --> 04:04:15.507
THESE WELLS CAN AND DO LEAK AND

04:04:15.574 --> 04:04:17.109
SOMETIMES THEY LEAK IN

04:04:17.175 --> 04:04:18.810
SIGNIFICANT QUANTITIES

04:04:18.877 --> 04:04:19.111
[inaudible]

04:04:19.177 --> 04:04:20.078
THE JOB.

04:04:20.145 --> 04:04:22.848
GOVERNMENT NASA HAS DONE A STUDY.

04:04:22.914 --> 04:04:24.016
IN LOOKING AT THE ATMOSPHERE

04:04:24.082 --> 04:04:25.751
OVER LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND

04:04:25.817 --> 04:04:26.818
FOUND ABNORMALLY HIGH

04:04:26.885 --> 04:04:29.054
CONCENTRATIONS OF METHANE IN THE

04:04:29.121 --> 04:04:30.022
ATMOSPHERE.

04:04:30.088 --> 04:04:31.957
AND THE BY LOOKING AT ISOTOPES

04:04:32.024 --> 04:04:33.358
IN IN THOSE SAMPLES THEY HAVE

04:04:33.425 --> 04:04:34.726
BEEN ABLE TO DISCERN.

04:04:34.793 --> 04:04:35.727
THAT THERE ARE.

04:04:35.794 --> 04:04:37.062
WILLING GAS EMISSIONS THAT ARE

04:04:37.129 --> 04:04:38.764
CONTRIBUTING TO METHANE

04:04:38.830 --> 04:04:40.966
EMISSIONS ABOVE LOS ANGELES AND

04:04:41.033 --> 04:04:42.768
AS OF YET THERE IS NO CLEAR

04:04:42.834 --> 04:04:44.336
INDICATION OF THE SOURCE SOME

04:04:44.403 --> 04:04:45.604
PEOPLE HAVE SAID.

04:04:45.670 --> 04:04:46.505
THEY'VE SUGGESTED THAT I DON'T

04:04:46.571 --> 04:04:49.074
HAVE BEEN WELL AS MAY BE PART OF

04:04:49.141 --> 04:04:50.575
THE CAUSE OF THIS.

04:04:50.642 --> 04:04:51.476
EVIDENCE FROM LIKE PENNSYLVANIA

04:04:51.543 --> 04:04:53.378
HAS SUGGESTED THAT IDOL IN A

04:04:53.445 --> 04:04:54.579
BAND WELLS CAN MAKE A

04:04:54.646 --> 04:04:56.014
SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTION THERE

04:04:56.081 --> 04:04:58.483
IN PENNSYLVANIA IT'S NEARLY 528%

04:04:58.550 --> 04:04:59.985
OF THE TOTAL STATES METHANE

04:05:00.052 --> 04:05:00.619
BUDGET.

04:05:00.685 --> 04:05:02.988
AND THE INCIDENCE OF VITAL

04:05:03.055 --> 04:05:04.790
MINERALS LEAKING IS HAS RECEIVED

04:05:04.856 --> 04:05:06.291
MUCH ATTENTION BECAUSE OF THAT.

04:05:06.358 --> 04:05:07.626
CALIFORNIA WE OF COURSE HAVE A

04:05:07.692 --> 04:05:09.761
SPECIAL PROBLEM IN THAT WE HAVE

04:05:09.828 --> 04:05:12.431
MANY PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN VERY

04:05:12.497 --> 04:05:13.165
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE SOURCES.

04:05:13.231 --> 04:05:14.299
TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE LIVE

04:05:14.366 --> 04:05:15.767
WITHIN ONE HUNDRED FEET OR LESS

04:05:15.834 --> 04:05:17.436
OF AN OLD ABANDONED OR I DON'T

04:05:17.502 --> 04:05:18.603
WELL WELL.

04:05:18.670 --> 04:05:19.704
IN A STUDY BY THE CALIFORNIA

04:05:19.771 --> 04:05:21.807
RESEARCHERS BOARD IN TWENTY

04:05:21.873 --> 04:05:23.642
FIFTEEN SHOW THAT IN OVER HALF

04:05:23.708 --> 04:05:25.644
OF THE LEAKS THAT THEY STUDIED.

04:05:25.710 --> 04:05:27.412
FROM OLD OIL WELLS OVER HALF OF

04:05:27.479 --> 04:05:28.747
THEM CONTAIN CANCER CAUSING

04:05:28.814 --> 04:05:30.482
COMPOUNDS AND SO WHEN WE HAVE

04:05:30.549 --> 04:05:31.483
PEOPLE LIVING IN CLOSE PROXIMITY

04:05:31.550 --> 04:05:32.050
TO THESE.

04:05:32.117 --> 04:05:34.386
SOURCES IT CAN CREATE EVEN FOR

04:05:34.453 --> 04:05:35.320
THE PROBLEM.

04:05:35.387 --> 04:05:37.522
THIS CREATES A STUDY TO EVALUATE

04:05:37.589 --> 04:05:39.157
THE PREVALENCE OF LEAKAGE OF

04:05:39.224 --> 04:05:41.193
THESE WELLS AND TO ALLOW THE

COULD SEE THAT INFORMATION

04:07:23.428 --> 04:07:24.329
INFORMATION.

04:07:24.396 --> 04:07:26.932
AS A WAY TO ENSURE ITS ACCURACY.

AND TO MISINFORM THE PUBLIC IF

04:07:33.838 --> 04:07:35.640
THAT'S BEEN ADDRESSED.

04:07:35.707 --> 04:07:37.976
ME LIKE THIS REALLY HEAR IT N.

04:07:38.043 --> 04:07:39.611
TO HEAR HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE

04:07:39.678 --> 04:07:40.645
DONE.

04:07:40.712 --> 04:07:41.646
AND SUPPOSE IS FINE WITH THE

04:07:41.713 --> 04:07:43.548
LANGUAGE -- WE LIKE TO KNOW WHO

WOULD BE ACTUALLY A PART OF THE

04:07:45.884 --> 04:07:46.751
PEER REVIEW PROCESS AS WELL.

04:07:46.818 --> 04:07:48.153
WE THINK WE HAVE THAT TO THAT

04:07:48.220 --> 04:07:49.988
RIGHT TO KNOW SINCE TALK IS

04:07:50.055 --> 04:07:51.022
GOING TO BE MY MEMBERS WELLS

04:07:51.089 --> 04:07:52.624
IT'S GOING TO BE INSPECTED.

04:07:52.691 --> 04:07:54.859
BY IF DEPENDING STUDY INCLUDES

04:07:54.926 --> 04:07:56.228
TESTING THE VAPORS OF WILL HAVE

04:07:56.294 --> 04:07:57.128
TO REQUEST.

04:07:57.195 --> 04:07:59.297
THAT THE TESTING SHOULD ALSO

04:07:59.364 --> 04:08:01.533
IDENTIFY HOW FAR AWAY FROM THE

04:08:01.600 --> 04:08:03.702
WELL -- THAT THE SAMPLES WERE

04:08:03.768 --> 04:08:04.636
ACTUALLY TAKEN.

04:08:04.703 --> 04:08:05.737
I WOULD MAKE THIS REQUEST

04:08:05.804 --> 04:08:07.973
BECAUSE A SAMPLE TAKEN AT THE

04:08:08.039 --> 04:08:10.208
WAR OF THE WELL NOT BE THE SAME

04:08:10.275 --> 04:08:12.844
AS IT BEING FURTHER AWAY.

04:08:12.911 --> 04:08:14.279
FROM THE BORE ON THESE TESTS

04:08:14.346 --> 04:08:15.780
PROVIDE WE THINK THE SAME RESULT

04:08:15.847 --> 04:08:21.152
AS A. B. SIX ONE SEVEN THAT WAS

04:08:21.219 --> 04:08:24.556
IN FACT -- I CHECKED IN TWENTY

04:08:24.623 --> 04:08:25.123
SEVENTEEN BY MEMBER CRISTINA

04:08:25.190 --> 04:08:26.391
GARCIA AND OF COURSE A STATS

04:08:26.458 --> 04:08:26.658
PROGRAM.

04:08:26.725 --> 04:08:27.659
SO WHILE WE THINK THAT SOME OF

04:08:27.726 --> 04:08:29.427
THE STUDY MAY BE DUPLICATIVE --

04:08:29.494 --> 04:08:31.162
WERE FINE WITH TO STUDY BUT WITH

04:08:31.229 --> 04:08:32.330
THOSE MINOR REQUEST OF THE

04:08:32.397 --> 04:08:36.468
AUTHOR WE WHICH IS FAST -- AND

04:08:36.534 --> 04:08:39.004

WELLS WHICH WE'VE BEEN TALKING

04:09:03.128 --> 04:09:04.029
ABOUT TODAY BUT ALSO.

04:09:04.095 --> 04:09:05.497
WE'VE HAD SOME.

04:09:05.563 --> 04:09:07.065
PROBLEMATIC WELLS IF YOU MAY

04:09:07.132 --> 04:09:08.566
CALL THEM THAT ITALY SO CANYON

04:09:08.633 --> 04:09:10.635

04:09:17.142 --> 04:09:18.310
HERE.

04:09:18.376 --> 04:09:19.711
RAISING OUR PRESENCE ALL THE WAY

04:09:19.778 --> 04:09:23.648
FROM LOS ANGELES -- I I KNOW YOU

04:09:23.715 --> 04:09:24.749
GUYS BEEN WORKING HIS FUGITIVE

04:09:24.816 --> 04:09:25.684
EMISSIONS ISSUE FOR A VERY LONG

04:09:25.750 --> 04:09:27.886
TIME.

04:09:27.952 --> 04:09:29.421

ANGELI SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF

04:09:34.993 --> 04:09:36.861
OVERALL FUGITIVE EMISSIONS IN

04:09:36.928 --> 04:09:37.362
THE STATE THAT WE'RE NOT

04:09:37.429 --> 04:09:39.431
TRACKING FROM.

04:09:39.497 --> 04:09:41.266
HI BLINDS OTHERS SORT OF LEAKY

04:09:41.333 --> 04:09:42.967
INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:09:43.034 --> 04:09:44.836
COULD THIS BE.

04:09:44.903 --> 04:09:47.439
NICOLE HE SAID THAT.

04:09:47.505 --> 04:09:48.006
I THINK IT REALLY GOT IN THE

04:09:48.073 --> 04:09:48.406
AGGREGATE.

04:09:48.473 --> 04:09:49.908
METHANE EMISSIONS FROM OIL AND

04:09:49.974 --> 04:09:52.510
GAS ARE THE LARGEST SOURCE OF OF

04:09:52.577 --> 04:09:54.145
METHANE EMISSIONS A CALIFORNIA

04:09:54.212 --> 04:09:55.180
AGRICULTURE IS.

04:09:55.246 --> 04:09:57.615
WHAT WE HAVE HERE ARE EMISSIONS

04:09:57.682 --> 04:09:59.484
THAT ARE -- CO LIMITED WITH

04:09:59.551 --> 04:10:00.819
THINGS LIKE BENZENE AND OTHER

04:10:00.885 --> 04:10:02.187
AIR TOXICS.

04:10:02.253 --> 04:10:03.555
WE ALSO HAVE SOURCES OF

04:10:03.621 --> 04:10:05.090
POLLUTION THAT ARE IN MANY

04:10:05.156 --> 04:10:07.459
PEOPLE'S BACKYARDS IN SO THE

04:10:07.525 --> 04:10:10.729
DATA SHOWS THAT THERE ARE SOME

04:10:10.795 --> 04:10:12.030
WELLS THAT ARE LIKELY TO COMMIT

04:10:12.097 --> 04:10:12.530
A LOT.

04:10:12.597 --> 04:10:14.799
AND OTHER WELLS THAT ARE LIKELY

04:10:14.866 --> 04:10:16.568
TO OMIT NONE OR LITTLE WE JUST

04:10:16.634 --> 04:10:17.969
REALLY HAVE NO WAY OF

04:10:18.036 --> 04:10:19.137
UNDERSTANDING WHAT SORT OF

04:10:19.204 --> 04:10:20.538
ATTRIBUTES OF THESE WELLS

04:10:20.605 --> 04:10:22.107
CONTRIBUTE TO THOSE.

04:10:22.173 --> 04:10:24.376
LEAKAGE RATES AND SO WE ARE

04:10:24.442 --> 04:10:26.578
UNABLE TO KNOW HOW LARGE OF A

04:10:26.644 --> 04:10:27.979
PROBLEM IT IS WE DO KNOW IN

04:10:28.046 --> 04:10:29.781
PLACES LIKE PENNSYLVANIA IT IS A

04:10:29.848 --> 04:10:31.549
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM -- BUT THERE

04:10:31.616 --> 04:10:33.518
THEY DO HAVE A LOT OF GAS

04:10:33.585 --> 04:10:35.086
PRODUCTION BY IN SOUTHERN

04:10:35.153 --> 04:10:36.254
CALIFORNIA FOR EXAMPLE OF WE

04:10:36.321 --> 04:10:36.988
HAVE A LOT OF HEAVY OIL

04:10:37.055 --> 04:10:37.956
PRODUCTION.

04:10:38.022 --> 04:10:39.624
IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

04:10:39.691 --> 04:10:40.725
MORE DRY GAS PRODUCTION.

04:10:40.792 --> 04:10:42.460
IT DEPENDS ON WHERE YOU ARE AND

04:10:42.527 --> 04:10:43.328
WHAT TYPE OF WELL YOU'RE LOOKING

04:10:43.395 --> 04:10:45.029
AT AND I DO THINK THAT WHEN YOU

04:10:45.096 --> 04:10:46.131
START TO LOOK AT THIS DATA AND

04:10:46.197 --> 04:10:47.432
YOU START TO EVALUATE.

04:10:47.499 --> 04:10:48.633
THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WEATHER

04:10:48.700 --> 04:10:49.501
OUT THERE YOU'LL SEE THAT

04:10:49.567 --> 04:10:50.902
PROBABLY IN SOME WELLS IS

04:10:50.969 --> 04:10:52.170
SIGNIFICANT ANOTHER WELL AS IT

04:10:52.237 --> 04:10:57.475
IS LESS SO WE JUST HAVE NO WAY

04:10:57.542 --> 04:10:57.909
OF KNOWING AT THIS.

04:10:57.976 --> 04:11:00.011
MOMENT.

04:11:00.078 --> 04:11:01.546
WE CAN'T MANAGE WE DON'T

04:11:01.613 --> 04:11:03.982
