SENATOR LEAHY- SO ONE OF THINGS

00:10:29.895 --> 00:10:31.731
I BELIEVE IT IS OPTIMIZING

00:10:31.797 --> 00:10:33.332
PROCESSES BEFORE AUTOMATING

00:10:33.399 --> 00:10:36.102
PROCESSES- AND MANY TIMES WHEN

00:10:36.168 --> 00:10:37.937
WE HAVE CHALLENGES IT'S LOOKING

00:10:38.004 --> 00:10:41.707
THAT TECHNOLOGY IS THE- IS THE

00:10:41.774 --> 00:10:42.675
IS THE SILVER BULLET THAT'S

00:10:42.742 --> 00:10:44.110
GOING TO SOLVE ALL THE BUSINESS

00:10:44.176 --> 00:10:46.145
PROBLEM SO I FIRST LOOK AT WHEN

00:10:46.212 --> 00:10:48.047
WE'RE DEPLOYING CHANGE AN

00:10:48.114 --> 00:10:50.349
ORGANIZATION OR LOOKING AT

00:10:50.416 --> 00:10:52.685
LARGE PROJECTS- MAKING SURE

00:10:52.752 --> 00:10:53.819
THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:55.721
KNOWLEDGE AN ORGANIZATION TO BE

00:10:55.788 --> 00:10:57.289
ABLE TO DO THAT SO A LOT OF

00:10:57.356 --> 00:10:58.424
TIMES IT'S PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

00:10:58.491 --> 00:10:59.892
PARTNERSHIPS. MAKING SURE THAT

00:10:59.959 --> 00:11:00.860
WE HAVE THE BROUGHT RIGHTS

00:11:00.926 --> 00:11:03.029
BUSINESS SPONSORSHIP AND THAT

00:11:03.095 --> 00:11:04.263
WE'RE WILLING TO LOOK AT THE

00:11:04.330 --> 00:11:05.631
FUTURE OF WHERE OUR PROCESS

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:07.066
NEEDS TO BE ON BEHALF OF THE

00:11:07.133 --> 00:11:08.434
RESIDENTS AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:11:08.501 --> 00:11:09.935
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE AUTOMATING

00:11:10.002 --> 00:11:11.203
AND THAT WE HAVE THE CAPABILITY

00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:12.338
SOMETIMES WE HAVE THE DESIRED

00:11:12.405 --> 00:11:13.806
CHANGE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO MAKE

00:11:13.873 --> 00:11:14.273
SURE THAT WE HAVE THE

00:11:14.340 --> 00:11:16.509
CAPABILITY THATWE'RE WILLING

00:11:16.575 --> 00:11:19.412
TO DO THE HARD WORK NECESSARY-

00:11:19.478 --> 00:11:22.314
AND- ALSO LOOKING AT CHANGE AND

00:11:22.381 --> 00:11:23.482
INCREMENTAL I THINK IT'S

00:11:23.549 --> 00:11:24.750
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO DELIVER

00:11:24.817 --> 00:11:26.452
INCREMENTAL WINS VERSUS STATE

00:11:26.519 --> 00:11:29.221
BANK- AND TECHNOLOGY FOR A LONG

00:11:29.288 --> 00:11:31.857
TIME. WAITING FIVE YEARS FOR

00:11:31.924 --> 00:11:33.025
FUNCTIONALITY IS NOT SOMETHING

00:11:33.092 --> 00:11:35.094
THAT ANY OF US HAVE PATIENTS TO

00:11:35.161 --> 00:11:37.263
DO AND WE BELIEVE THAT BY

00:11:37.329 --> 00:11:38.597
PUTTING THESE THINGS AND

00:11:38.664 --> 00:11:40.433
MODULES THAT WE ARE DELIVERING

00:11:40.499 --> 00:11:42.301
GOOD FUNCTIONALITY TO OUR

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.536
CONSTITUENTS AND TO OUR

00:11:43.602 --> 00:11:46.772
BUSINESS PARTNERS IT SHOWS- YOU

00:11:46.839 --> 00:11:47.907
KNOW THAT WE'RE BUILDING UPON

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:49.075
OUR SUCCESSES AND I THINK IT'S

00:11:49.141 --> 00:11:50.776
EXTREMELY IMPORTANT TO DO THAT

00:11:50.843 --> 00:11:52.044
I THINK IT'S ALSO AS I WAS

00:11:52.111 --> 00:11:53.179
TALKING ABOUT INNOVATION WITH

00:11:53.245 --> 00:11:55.314
PURPOSE IS EXTREMELY. IMPORTANT

00:11:55.381 --> 00:11:57.016
THAT WE DON'T FORGET WHO WE

00:11:57.083 --> 00:11:58.984
SERVE- WHEN I WAS A

00:11:59.051 --> 00:12:00.219
CORRECTIONAL HEALTHCARE WE WERE

00:12:00.286 --> 00:12:03.122
MAKING SURE THAT- WHEN I CAME

00:12:03.189 --> 00:12:04.323
TO THE NURSES THE DOCTORS

00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:05.624
ALLIED HEALTH SERVICES IT'S A

00:12:05.691 --> 00:12:07.293
PART OF MAKING SURE THAT WHEN

00:12:07.359 --> 00:12:08.894
WE'RE DELIVERING INNOVATION

00:12:08.961 --> 00:12:11.230
THAT IS IMPROVING THEIR ABILITY

00:12:11.297 --> 00:12:14.366
TO DELIVER SERVICES- TO- THIS

00:12:14.433 --> 00:12:16.435
CASE IT WAS IN MY PATIENTS AND

00:12:16.502 --> 00:12:17.937
AS WE TALKED CENTER LAYERED I

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:19.939
BELIEVE WALKING A MILE IN OUR

00:12:20.005 --> 00:12:21.407
CUSTOMERS SHOES IS EXTREMELY

00:12:21.474 --> 00:12:23.676
IMPORTANT- AS WELL AS SOMETIMES

00:12:23.742 --> 00:12:25.177
AGAIN NOT JUST FOCUSING ON THE

00:12:25.244 --> 00:12:26.479
TECHNOLOGY THAT ACTUALLY

00:12:26.545 --> 00:12:32.651
WALKING. OUT INTO- I WALKED

00:12:32.718 --> 00:12:33.652
EVERY SINGLE INSTANCE. I ALSO

00:12:33.719 --> 00:12:34.887
GO KIND OF LIKE SETTING UP A

00:12:34.954 --> 00:12:35.955
DAY THE LIFE YOU ARE SO SIDE BY

00:12:36.021 --> 00:12:36.555
SIDE WITH PEOPLE THAT YOU ARE

00:12:36.622 --> 00:12:38.958
GOING TO. IMPLEMENTED INSURANCE.

00:12:39.024 --> 00:12:42.695
HOW THEY'RE ACTUALLY UTILIZING-

00:12:42.761 --> 00:12:43.562
PROCESSES SO THAT YOU'RE

00:12:43.629 --> 00:12:45.297
AUTOMATING ALIGNED TO WHAT THEY

00:12:45.364 --> 00:12:46.599
NEED. ONE OF THE THINGS I

00:12:46.665 --> 00:12:47.967
NOTICED WHEN I WALKED OUT INTO

00:12:48.033 --> 00:12:49.902
AN INSTITUTION WE HAD RECENTLY

00:12:49.969 --> 00:12:52.071
CONVERTED ALL THE DIGITAL BEAT

00:12:52.138 --> 00:12:54.840
THE FILM IMAGES TO. ADDITIONAL

00:12:54.907 --> 00:12:55.808
AND WHEN I WALKED THE

00:12:55.875 --> 00:12:57.276
INSTITUTION I SAW DENNIS

00:12:57.343 --> 00:12:58.978
ACTUALLY DRILLING ANI- AN

00:12:59.044 --> 00:13:00.980
INMATE PATIENTS TO. AND HE KEPT

00:13:01.046 --> 00:13:03.582
WIGGLING THE MOUSE WITH HIS-

00:13:03.649 --> 00:13:06.152
HIS FOOT AND- OBVIOUSLY NEED AN

00:13:06.218 --> 00:13:07.586
OUTSIDER COULD QUITE UNDERSTAND

00:13:07.653 --> 00:13:08.621
WHY THIS WE'RE GOING AMOUNTS

00:13:08.687 --> 00:13:10.789
WITH THIS BUT- LET HIM FINISH

00:13:10.856 --> 00:13:12.424
HIS JOB AFTER WAS DONE WE WENT

00:13:12.491 --> 00:13:13.859
IN TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH

00:13:13.926 --> 00:13:15.494
HIM. AND HE SAID THAT WE HAD TO

00:13:15.561 --> 00:13:17.496
FIND A POLICY THAT IF YOU

00:13:17.563 --> 00:13:18.964
DIDN'T ACTUALLY MOVE THE MOUSE

00:13:19.031 --> 00:13:20.499
OF THIS COMING MINUTES. HE

00:13:20.566 --> 00:13:22.301
COULD ACTUALLY SEE THE SCREEN A

00:13:22.368 --> 00:13:24.136
WORD THAT HE NEEDED TO DROUGHT.

00:13:24.203 --> 00:13:26.405
AND SO- WE HAD UNBEKNOWNST TO

00:13:26.472 --> 00:13:27.840
US TO FIND A POLICY THAT

00:13:27.907 --> 00:13:28.974
ACTUALLY AFFECTED HIS ABILITY

00:13:29.041 --> 00:13:30.976
TO DO ITS JOB. AND HE MAY NEVER

00:13:31.043 --> 00:13:32.311
HAVE BROUGHT THAT UP AND SO I

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:33.879
JUST THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS WE

00:13:33.946 --> 00:13:35.147
DELIVER INCREMENTAL WINS THAT

00:13:35.214 --> 00:13:37.082
WE NEVER FORGET- THAT WE NEED

00:13:37.149 --> 00:13:37.983
TO GO OUT AND SEE HOW THAT

00:13:38.050 --> 00:13:43.355
TECHNOLOGY. IS BEING APPLIED IN

00:13:43.422 --> 00:13:44.857
REAL LIFE. AND YOU KNOW YOU

00:13:44.924 --> 00:13:45.824
MEANT THAT. WHEN I MET WITH AND

00:13:45.891 --> 00:13:47.092
I MEANT TO GET NAME OF THAT

00:13:47.159 --> 00:13:47.660
DENTAL. TO MAKE SURE THAT I

00:13:47.726 --> 00:13:52.831
DON'T TO. END UP THERE- THANK

ALTHOUGH I MIGHT ADD THAT

00:14:02.908 --> 00:14:04.310
DENNIS OBVIOUSLY KNEW HOW TO

00:14:04.376 --> 00:14:05.811
GET HIS JOB DONE DESPITE THE

00:14:05.878 --> 00:14:07.446
TECHNOLOGY THAT OBVIOUSLY

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:09.448
DOESN'T ALWAYS WORK- I DIDN'T

00:14:09.515 --> 00:14:11.917
CATCH THE STORED FIRST I

00:14:11.984 --> 00:14:14.720
THOUGHT HE WAS WE'RE GOING TO.

OKAY BUT THAT IS A VERY GOOD

00:14:16.922 --> 00:14:18.991
IT'S A VERY GOOD EXAMPLE I

00:14:19.058 --> 00:14:21.193

USING COBALT- WHICH I THINK. I

00:15:00.165 --> 00:15:02.167
LEARNED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT-

00:15:02.234 --> 00:15:04.536
WHEN I WAS IN GRADUATE SCHOOL-

00:15:04.603 --> 00:15:08.707
IN. THE PRIOR MILLENNIA AND SO.

00:15:08.774 --> 00:15:09.842
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD

00:15:09.908 --> 00:15:11.777
JUST SHARE WITH US HOW. YOU

00:15:11.844 --> 00:15:14.213
KNOW HOW ANTIQUATED OR OUR OUR

00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:16.115
SYSTEMS ARE SOFTWARE AND

00:15:16.181 --> 00:15:19.818
HARDWARE SYSTEMS. AT ANTIQUATED

00:15:19.885 --> 00:15:21.854
WHAT IS THE SORT OF THE

00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:25.291
MODERNIZATION ROLL OUT- FOR

00:15:25.357 --> 00:15:27.660
BOTH THE PLATFORMS. THAT WE ARE

00:15:27.726 --> 00:15:30.763
A USING AND THAT ALSO- THAT ARE

00:15:30.829 --> 00:15:34.066
CALIFORNIA CUSTOMERS- ARE

00:15:34.133 --> 00:15:35.834
REALLY DEPENDENT UPON AND CAN

00:15:35.901 --> 00:15:36.402
YOU JUST SHARE A LITTLE BIT

00:15:36.468 --> 00:15:38.337
ABOUT HOW THAT'S- HOW THAT IS

00:15:38.404 --> 00:15:39.672
GOING TO WORK BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:15:39.738 --> 00:15:40.906
SO MANY DEPARTMENTS YOU HAVE SO

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:43.375
MANY DEPARTMENTS. THAT YOU HAVE

00:15:43.442 --> 00:15:49.315
TO MONITOR- AND SUPPORT. THANK

00:15:49.381 --> 00:15:51.450
YOU FOR THE QUESTION- SO WHEN

00:15:51.517 --> 00:15:54.653
COBALT WAS- IMPLEMENTED THE

00:15:54.720 --> 00:15:55.621
NICE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT WAS

00:15:55.688 --> 00:15:57.389
HARDWARE AGNOSTIC RIGHT SO IT

00:15:57.456 --> 00:15:58.724
WAS IT DID TRANSACTIONS

00:15:58.791 --> 00:16:00.392
EXTREMELY WELL BETTER THAN ANY

00:16:00.459 --> 00:16:03.595
OTHER TECHNOLOGY AND WAS AT- AT

00:16:03.662 --> 00:16:05.898
AT THAT HAS THE BEST TIME THE

00:16:05.964 --> 00:16:07.766
BEST THE BEST- CUTTING TO

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:09.902
LANGUAGE YOU COULD USE. AND SO

00:16:09.968 --> 00:16:11.437
WE DO WE HAVE FOURTEEN

00:16:11.503 --> 00:16:12.171
DEPARTMENTS THAT STILL USE

00:16:12.237 --> 00:16:14.340
COBALT- THE SYSTEMS ARE

00:16:14.406 --> 00:16:15.507
PERFORMING EXACTLY THE WAY THEY

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.810
WORK AND THE TRANSACTIONS ARE

00:16:17.876 --> 00:16:18.811
PERFORMING AT A VERY HIGH

00:16:18.877 --> 00:16:22.081
SPEED- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT-

00:16:22.147 --> 00:16:23.215
THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE PROBABLY

00:16:23.282 --> 00:16:26.085
AWARE OF THIS THANKS 95% OF OUR

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.886
ATM TRANSACTIONS ARE STILL.

00:16:27.953 --> 00:16:31.357
USED ON USING COBALT- AND 45%

00:16:31.423 --> 00:16:32.725
OF THE BANKS FOR THEIR NEED A

00:16:32.791 --> 00:16:35.461
PRIMARY SYSTEMS NEWS COBALT-

00:16:35.527 --> 00:16:37.996
WHAT I LOOK FOR IS IT MEETING

00:16:38.063 --> 00:16:40.332
THE NEEDS OF HER CONSTITUENTS-

00:16:40.399 --> 00:16:41.934
I THINK T'S NOT THE TECHNOLOGY

00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:43.736
THAT I WORRY SO MUCH ABOUT IT'S

00:16:43.802 --> 00:16:45.504
THAT WE HAVE THIS HUGE. YOUR

00:16:45.571 --> 00:16:48.207
PEOPLE ARE RETIRING- OR THEY'RE

00:16:48.273 --> 00:16:49.441
NOT AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO

00:16:49.508 --> 00:16:51.443
SUPPORT THE SYSTEMS AND SO OUR

00:16:51.510 --> 00:16:53.879
JOB. YOU HAVE SEVERAL CHOICES

00:16:53.946 --> 00:16:55.314
AS A DEPARTMENT AND MANY OF

00:16:55.381 --> 00:16:56.582
THESE ARE THIRTY FORTY YEARS

00:16:56.648 --> 00:16:59.151
OLD AND IT REQUIRES RE CODING-

00:16:59.218 --> 00:17:00.586
IN YOUR BUILDING SOMETHING FROM

00:17:00.652 --> 00:17:03.722
THE GROUND UP I. AT DEPARTMENT

00:17:03.789 --> 00:17:05.023
TECHNOLOGY WHAT I LIKE SO MUCH

00:17:05.090 --> 00:17:07.192
IS THAT WE HAVE THE LATEST IBM

00:17:07.259 --> 00:17:08.660
TECHNOLOGIES AND WE HAVE THE

00:17:08.727 --> 00:17:10.729
OPPORTUNITY TO HELP DEPARTMENTS

00:17:10.796 --> 00:17:12.998
MODERNIZE THEIR APPLICATIONS

00:17:13.065 --> 00:17:13.966
THAT OCCURRED WITHIN THEIR

00:17:14.032 --> 00:17:15.901
CURRENT ENVIRONMENT- WE DON'T

00:17:15.968 --> 00:17:17.436
HAVE TO WAIT TILL YOU KNOW A

00:17:17.503 --> 00:17:18.904
BIG BANG WHERE IT HAS TO GO

00:17:18.971 --> 00:17:20.606
COMPLETELY INTO THE CLOUD SO I

00:17:20.672 --> 00:17:21.340
THINK THERE'S DEFINITELY

00:17:21.407 --> 00:17:23.075
INCREMENTAL WINS. ON THAT WE

00:17:23.142 --> 00:17:25.210
CAN BE PUTTING AND PLACE AND

00:17:25.277 --> 00:17:27.212
NOT NOT WAIT FOR EVERY SINGLE

00:17:27.279 --> 00:17:28.514
ONE OF THOSE APPLICATIONS TO BE

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:30.315
REGRETFUL- I THINK THAT WOULD

00:17:30.382 --> 00:17:31.984
BE A VERY LONG TIME AND IF WE

00:17:32.050 --> 00:17:34.153
APPROACH IT THAT WAY- I THINK

00:17:34.219 --> 00:17:35.220
IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR

00:17:35.287 --> 00:17:36.555
US AS A STATE TO GET ACROSS THE

00:17:36.622 --> 00:17:38.056
FINISH LINE WE HAVE TO LOOK FOR

00:17:38.123 --> 00:17:39.958
THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. TO PULL

00:17:40.025 --> 00:17:40.759
DIFFERENT PIECES OF THE

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.594
REPORTING PART OF IT IF IT'S A

00:17:42.661 --> 00:17:44.563
CERTAIN PART OF THE APPLICATION

00:17:44.630 --> 00:17:46.899
THAT RUNS- PARTS OF THE DATA

00:17:46.965 --> 00:17:48.200
THERE'S OPPORTUNITIES TO BREAK

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:50.436
THAT UP AND TO PROVIDE A LOW

00:17:50.502 --> 00:17:56.675
CODE- SOLUTIONS TO THOSE

00:17:56.742 --> 00:17:57.276
DEPARTMENTS. GREAT THANK YOU

00:17:57.342 --> 00:17:58.110
FOR THAT I HAVE TO SAY AND I.

00:17:58.177 --> 00:17:59.411
CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO OFFEND

00:17:59.478 --> 00:18:02.181

STUFF IS COMPLEX AND IF YOU

MAKE A BIG SPLASH WHEN REALLY

00:18:55.934 --> 00:18:57.236
WE SHOULD BE. FOCUSED ON THE

00:18:57.302 --> 00:18:59.671
FOUNDATIONAL. WITH THAT IN MIND

00:18:59.738 --> 00:19:00.939
I JUST WANT TO GET SOME OF YOUR

00:19:01.006 --> 00:19:02.508
THOUGHTS ON WHAT WE'RE TRYING

BROADBAND. YOU KNOW WE ARE ON A

00:19:13.218 --> 00:19:15.621
TIMELINE BASED ON. RESOURCES

00:19:15.687 --> 00:19:16.822
WERE GETTING FROM THE FEDERAL

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:18.257
GOVERNMENT AND WHAT'S OUTLINED

00:19:18.323 --> 00:19:19.992
THERE. I JUST LOVE YOUR

00:19:20.058 --> 00:19:21.460
THOUGHTS A LITTLE BIT ON HOW

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:22.961
YOU'RE GONNA BE AN INTEGRAL

00:19:23.028 --> 00:19:25.564
PART OF THAT OBVIOUSLY. HOW YOU

00:19:25.631 --> 00:19:27.566
WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON THAT

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:31.270
AS WE- GET READY TO EXPAND.

00:19:31.336 --> 00:19:33.105
INTO UNDERSERVED AREAS AND DO

00:19:33.171 --> 00:19:34.540
IT AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE BUT

00:19:34.606 --> 00:19:36.408
KIND OF MEETING THAT- THAT

00:19:36.475 --> 00:19:37.709
POINT THAT YOU MADE ABOUT LET'S

00:19:37.776 --> 00:19:40.078
DO IT RIGHT LET'S MAKE SURE

00:19:40.145 --> 00:19:40.846
THOUGHT JUST THOUGHTS GENERAL

00:19:40.913 --> 00:19:44.783
THERE'S NO. SPECIFIC QUESTION

00:19:44.850 --> 00:19:45.417
THEY'RE JUST TRYING TO GET YOUR

00:19:45.484 --> 00:19:47.819
PERSPECTIVE. THIS IS AN

00:19:47.886 --> 00:19:49.888
EXCITING TIME- OBVIOUSLY THE

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:53.158
PANDEMIC HAD. HIGHLIGHTED THAT

00:19:53.225 --> 00:19:54.726
WE KNEW THAT THE DIGITAL VITAL.

00:19:54.793 --> 00:19:56.695
WAS VERY PRESENT IN OUR LIVES.

00:19:56.762 --> 00:19:58.797
BUT WHEN EVERYONE WAS THEN-

00:19:58.864 --> 00:20:00.232
REQUIRED TO STAY HOME AND

00:20:00.299 --> 00:20:02.167
REALLY RELIED ON TECHNOLOGY

00:20:02.234 --> 00:20:04.536
INTERNET. IT WAS EVEN MORE-

00:20:04.603 --> 00:20:05.971
GLARING AND IT IS JUST A

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:08.173
WONDERFUL EXCITING TIME TO BE-

00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.408
PARTS DEPARTMENT A PART OF

00:20:09.474 --> 00:20:11.376
CALIFORNIA TO HELP. ADDRESS

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:12.711
THOSE THOSE UNDERSERVED AND

00:20:12.778 --> 00:20:15.080
UNSERVED- IN THE COMMUNITIES

00:20:15.147 --> 00:20:17.950
AND SO. JUST FOR- YOURSELF AND

00:20:18.016 --> 00:20:19.384
FOR THE AUDIENCE- WHEN I WORKED

00:20:19.451 --> 00:20:21.687
AT CORRECTIONAL HEALTHCARE-

00:20:21.753 --> 00:20:23.922
THOSE PRISON SYSTEMS ARE ALMOST

00:20:23.989 --> 00:20:25.023
LIKE CITIES FROM. AMONG

00:20:25.090 --> 00:20:27.826
THEMSELVES AND WE NEED TO MOVE-

00:20:27.893 --> 00:20:29.294
A LARGE IMAGES FROM ONE

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:31.663
INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER- THE

00:20:31.730 --> 00:20:33.165
BROADBAND THAT WE HAD A FIBER

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.700
WE HAD BETWEEN THE INSTITUTIONS

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:35.934
FROM CRESCENT CITY ALL THE WAY

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:37.803
DOWN TO BLANK NEAR. THE MEXICO

00:20:37.869 --> 00:20:40.672
BORDER- WAS NOT SUFFICIENT AND

00:20:40.739 --> 00:20:41.840
SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:20:41.907 --> 00:20:43.942
COME TO THE TABLE WITH AS I HAD

00:20:44.009 --> 00:20:46.211

TIME YESTERDAY- AND- VERY

00:37:50.635 --> 00:37:52.303
INTERESTING THIS WORK THAT IS

IN FRONT OF YOU- AND I REALLY

00:37:54.905 --> 00:37:57.008
ONLY HAVE- TWO QUESTIONS. THE

00:37:57.074 --> 00:37:59.310
FIRST ONE IS WHICH WE TALKED

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:00.845
ABOUT A LITTLE BIT YESTERDAY.

00:38:00.911 --> 00:38:03.214
CAN YOU TALK ABOUT- THE

00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:05.883
POSSIBLE ROLE THAT- CRYPTO

00:38:05.950 --> 00:38:10.488
CURRENCY- MAY PLAY. AND HOW WE

00:38:10.554 --> 00:38:13.190
LIVE AND HOW WE- PROTECT HOW WE

00:38:13.257 --> 00:38:15.059
NEGOTIATE CREDIT- THIS IS

00:38:15.126 --> 00:38:16.093
SOMETHING THAT WE'RE HEARING

00:38:16.160 --> 00:38:18.929
ABOUT MORE AND MORE. CITIES ARE

00:38:18.996 --> 00:38:20.898
GETTING INTO THE CRYPTOCURRENCY

00:38:20.965 --> 00:38:23.134
SPACE AND IT'S ONLY A MATTER OF

00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:25.770
TIME BEFORE THOSE KINDS OF-

00:38:25.836 --> 00:38:27.638
CONVERSATIONS ARE ELEVATED TO

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:29.306
THE STATE LEVEL SO LET YOUR

00:38:29.373 --> 00:38:31.642
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT. YES THANK

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:32.877
YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR THE

00:38:32.943 --> 00:38:36.213
QUESTION- CRYPTOCURRENCY IS IN

00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:37.948
THE NEWS A LOT A LOT OF PEOPLE

00:38:38.015 --> 00:38:39.283
SCRATCH THEIR HEADS WHEN THEY

00:38:39.350 --> 00:38:42.153
SEE THE WORD AND DON'T QUITE-KNOW WHAT IT IS IT IS A BLANKET

00:38:42.219 --> 00:38:44.055
TERM. FOR A TECHNOLOGICAL

00:38:44.121 --> 00:38:46.090
INNOVATION THAT IS SHOWING UP

00:38:46.157 --> 00:38:48.492
IN MORE THAN ONE KIND OF WAY IN

00:38:48.559 --> 00:38:50.127
FINANCIAL SERVICES ON THE

00:38:50.194 --> 00:38:51.328
TECHNOLOGY THAT UNDERGIRDS

00:38:51.395 --> 00:38:52.930
CRYPTO CURRENCIES COULD HAVE AN

00:38:52.997 --> 00:38:54.765
IMPACT ON DEPOSIT TAKING AND

00:38:54.832 --> 00:38:57.468
LENDING ONE PAYMENT PROCESSING-

00:38:57.535 --> 00:38:59.136
AND SO THERE IS NO ONE SIZE

00:38:59.203 --> 00:39:00.938
FITS ALL APPROACH TO ADDRESSING

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:03.407
THAT. I HERE AT THE DEPARTMENT-

00:39:03.474 --> 00:39:05.676
WE ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGING IN

00:39:05.743 --> 00:39:07.678
THIS SPACE INDEED THIS IS

00:39:07.745 --> 00:39:09.246
OUTSIDE OF MY PARTICULAR

00:39:09.313 --> 00:39:10.481
DIVISION I DON'T HAVE AS MUCH

00:39:10.548 --> 00:39:13.217
OF A DIRECT ROLE IN SUPERVISING

00:39:13.284 --> 00:39:15.186
CRYPTO CURRENCY AS A TECHNOLOGY

00:39:15.252 --> 00:39:17.154
HOWEVER IDO KNOW IN SOME OF

00:39:17.221 --> 00:39:19.490
OUR OTHER DIVISIONS WE HAVE

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.258
SOME. LICENSEES THAT ARE

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:23.127
LOOKING TO CRYPTOCURRENCY AS A

00:39:23.194 --> 00:39:25.696
SOLUTION TO THEIR BUSINESS

00:39:25.763 --> 00:39:27.698
MODEL I AND WE HAVE TO TAKE A

00:39:27.765 --> 00:39:29.533
MEASURED APPROACH HERE BECAUSE

00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:30.968
THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACETS TO

00:39:31.035 --> 00:39:32.269
CRYPTOCURRENCY GET BECAUSE IT

00:39:32.336 --> 00:39:34.472
SHOWS UP IN FINANCIAL SERVICES

00:39:34.538 --> 00:39:36.173
IN MORE THAN ONE WAY WE NEED

00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:41.912
TO. TAKE A MEASURED APPROACH.

00:39:41.979 --> 00:39:42.980
LOOK CASE BY CASE. I HAVE A

00:39:43.047 --> 00:39:44.815
PARTICULAR. USE CASE- TO THE

00:39:44.882 --> 00:39:46.917
PATH. AND SO THERE ARE SOME BIG

00:39:46.984 --> 00:39:48.719
QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW TO REGULATE

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:50.755
I WILL ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE IN

00:39:50.821 --> 00:39:52.923
DISCUSSIONS WITH AND REGULARLY

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.325
TALK WITH OUR STATE AND FEDERAL

00:39:54.391 --> 00:39:55.926
PARTNERS BECAUSE THIS ALTHOUGH

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.061
MANY OF THESE COMPANIES OUR

00:39:57.128 --> 00:39:58.829
HOUSE RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA.

00:39:58.896 --> 00:40:00.164
THERE ARE NOT JUST STATEWIDE

00:40:00.231 --> 00:40:01.732
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE GROWTH OF

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:02.767
THIS MARKET BUT THERE ARE

00:40:02.833 --> 00:40:04.101
ATIONAL AND ACTUALLY EVEN

00:40:04.168 --> 00:40:05.736
INTERNATIONAL IMPLICATIONS FOR

00:40:05.803 --> 00:40:07.104
HEALTH FINANCIAL REGULATORS GET

00:40:07.171 --> 00:40:08.539
THEIR ARMS AROUND. THESE

00:40:08.606 --> 00:40:10.741
TECHNOLOGIES AND DETERMINE. HOW

00:40:10.808 --> 00:40:11.942
BEST TO REGULATE DONE BECAUSE

00:40:12.009 --> 00:40:14.078
AT THE END OF THE DAY. AS WITH

00:40:14.145 --> 00:40:15.880
ANY OTHER INNOVATION WE NEED TO

00:40:15.946 --> 00:40:17.515
ENSURE THAT WHERE THERE ARE

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.550
BENEFITS ARE THAT WE ARE

00:40:19.617 --> 00:40:21.152
KNOWLEDGE DOES BUT WE ALWAYS

00:40:21.218 --> 00:40:22.787
NEED TO ENSURE. THAT THESE

00:40:22.853 --> 00:40:24.221
TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATIONS ARE

00:40:24.288 --> 00:40:26.257
NOT CREATING SYSTEMIC RISK OR

00:40:26.323 --> 00:40:28.092
POSING HARM TO CONSUMERS

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.693
BECAUSE WE DO NOT WANT A

00:40:29.760 --> 00:40:30.661
PARTICULARLY THOSE WHO COME

00:40:30.728 --> 00:40:31.529
FROM OUR UNDERSERVED

00:40:31.595 --> 00:40:34.532
COMMUNITIES. TO BE GUINEA PIGS

00:40:34.598 --> 00:40:36.100
FOR SO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION

00:40:36.167 --> 00:40:37.468
SO THERE REALLY IS A DELICATE

00:40:37.535 --> 00:40:39.570
BALANCING ACT THERE- BUT AGAIN

00:40:39.637 --> 00:40:41.639
WE ARE TAKING. A VERY MEASURED

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:43.240
APPROACH AND GATHERING THAT

00:40:43.307 --> 00:40:45.276
DATA AND I ANTICIPATE THAT AS

00:40:45.342 --> 00:40:47.244
WE LEARN MORE AND AS WE ENGAGE

00:40:47.311 --> 00:40:48.612
MORE WITH STAKEHOLDERS ARE

00:40:48.679 --> 00:40:49.713
THINKING WILL OF ALL AND OUR

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.515
POLICY WILL FALL ALONG THE WAY.

00:40:51.582 --> 00:40:53.450
YEAH THANK YOU FOR THAT. IT'S

00:40:53.517 --> 00:40:56.120
BEEN ON MY MIND MOSTLY BECAUSE-

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.856
CITIES- IN FLORIDA FOR EXAMPLE

00:40:58.923 --> 00:41:01.025
AND IN SOME OTHER STATES. ARE

00:41:01.091 --> 00:41:03.928
NOW ALLOWING. CRYPTO CURRENCY

00:41:03.994 --> 00:41:05.996
TO BE USED TO PAY FOR- CITY

00:41:06.063 --> 00:41:08.265
SERVICES. AND SO I CAN ONLY

00:41:08.332 --> 00:41:10.301
IMAGINE THAT THAT IS SOMETHING.

00:41:10.367 --> 00:41:11.635
THAT OTHER CITIES AND OTHER

00:41:11.702 --> 00:41:13.070
STATES WILL BEGIN TO LOOK INTO

00:41:13.137 --> 00:41:18.475
SO I ALWAYS THINK IT'S GOOD. TO

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:19.076
BE IN FRONT OF THE EIGHT BALL

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:19.743
RATHER THAN. BUT IT I CERTAINLY

00:41:19.810 --> 00:41:22.046
A- EXPERTISE INTHE CONSUMER

00:41:22.112 --> 00:41:24.048
PROTECTION SPACE I THINK- WE

00:41:24.114 --> 00:41:26.217
NEED MORE OF IT AND- THERE'S

00:41:26.283 --> 00:41:27.785
BEEN SOME GOOD BILLS. THAT

00:41:27.852 --> 00:41:30.621
HAVE- PAST- IN THIS LEGISLATURE

00:41:30.688 --> 00:41:32.423
RECENTLY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:41:32.489 --> 00:41:34.992
ARE PROTECTING OUR- CONSUMERS.

00:41:35.059 --> 00:41:36.594
ARE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE

00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:38.863
SOME GOOD FAITH ACTORS SOME

00:41:38.929 --> 00:41:40.264
GOOD FAITH LENDERS. IN

00:41:40.331 --> 00:41:41.866
CALIFORNIA WHO ARE PLAYING BY

00:41:41.932 --> 00:41:44.168
OUR RULES. BUT WITH SOME

00:41:44.235 --> 00:41:46.270
ADVANCES IN THE- FINANCIAL

00:41:46.337 --> 00:41:50.007
TECHNOLOGY. AS AT CALIFORNIA

00:41:50.074 --> 00:41:53.544
CONSUMERS CAN JUST GO- ONLINE

00:41:53.611 --> 00:41:55.880
OR GO OUT OF STATE AND SO WHAT

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:57.014
ARE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW YOU

00:41:57.081 --> 00:41:58.315
CAN PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S

00:41:58.382 --> 00:42:01.118
CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS AND

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:03.354
ELEVATE AND SUPPORT ARE OF GOOD

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:05.556
FAITH CALIFORNIA LENDERS. YES

THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE

00:42:06.690 --> 00:42:07.958
QUESTION THAT IS OUR MISSION

00:42:08.025 --> 00:42:09.293
NOW IS DO YOU HAVE P. I. VERY

00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:11.395
VERY CLEARLY STATED. IN THE C.

00:42:11.462 --> 00:42:12.930
C. F. P. L. WE HAVE A DUAL

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.899
MISSION TO PROTECT CONSUMERS

00:42:14.965 --> 00:42:16.333
AND FOSTER RESPONSIBLE

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.369
INNOVATION WHEN TECHNOLOGY

00:42:18.435 --> 00:42:20.871
OUTPACES THE LAW AS IT. IS WANT

00:42:20.938 --> 00:42:23.340
TO DO- THERE CAN BE A CONUNDRUM

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:24.541
FROM UNFAIR COMPETITION

00:42:24.608 --> 00:42:26.677
STANDPOINT WHERE THERE IS

00:42:26.744 --> 00:42:28.846
REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY THERE

00:42:28.913 --> 00:42:30.781
COULD BE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE

00:42:30.848 --> 00:42:33.417
OF RESPONSIBLE INNOVATORS NOT

00:42:33.484 --> 00:42:34.285
KNOWING WHICH RULES ARE

00:42:34.351 --> 00:42:36.020
SUPPOSED TO PLAY BY WHICH CAN

00:42:36.086 --> 00:42:38.155
INFORM ATTENTION INHERIT THEIR

00:42:38.222 --> 00:42:40.224
INVESTMENT DECISIONS ALSO FOR

00:42:40.291 --> 00:42:41.892
RULE AT THE DEPARTMENT IS TO

00:42:41.959 --> 00:42:44.662
ENSURE. THAT WE ARE LEVERAGING

COMPLIANCE ISSUES AND CONCERNS

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:59.944
ARE BECAUSE AS WE CAN MOVE

00:43:00.010 --> 00:43:00.978
FORWARD AND UPDATE OUR
