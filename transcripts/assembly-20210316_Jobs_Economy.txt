AT THIS POINT SEEN NINE ARE WE CAN GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO AGENDA ITEM TO. OUR FIRST SPEAKER I'VE WE CAN BEGAN- BY OPENING HIS AUDIO VIDEO SETTING. FOR OUR ASSEMBLY TECHNICIANS I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT THERE IS A POWER POINT PRESENTATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OUR PORTION. I'M HERE MY ERROR. LOL NOTHING. LIKE THAT SO WE ARE NOT AT IT BUT WE DO NOT HAVE POWER POINT PRESENTATION FOR THIS AGENDA ITEMS LET ME GO AHEAD AND INTRODUCE MISTER BRYANT YOU ALERT DEPUTY LEGISLATIVE ANALYST WITH THE OFFICE AS A LEGISLATIVE ANALYST HE DOES COVER A NUMBER OF IMPORTANT DEPARTMENTS INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND THE FINANCING AUTHORITIES WITHIN THE TREASURER'S OFFICE MOST RECENTLY THE L. A. O. RELEASED A FRAMEWORK FOR EVALUATING THE STATE ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROPOSALS- THAT DOES EMPHASIZE TIME WHEN. TIMELY MESSED HER JEAN AND ENSURING THAT RECOVERY ACTIONS DO NOT INADVERTENTLY EXASPERATED PREEXISTING INEQUITIES. I MISTER YOU ARE HAS BEEN USING THIS FRAMEWORK IN DISCUSSING KEY ELEMENTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC RECOVERY PACKAGE AS WELL AS PROVIDING. PROVIDING US WITH THE PRELIMINARY LOOK AT HOW THE ONE POINT NINE TRILLION DOLLAR AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN AND THEY'RE- SUPPOSED TO TRILLION DOLLAR FEDERAL SIMON MITIGATION AND PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN COULD BE LEVERAGE FOR A MORE INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY IN CALIFORNIA. MISTER YOU ARE ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU FOR JOINING. US THIS MORNING HIS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. THANK FOR HAVING OUR OFFICE OF HER JUST IN THIS AREA TODAY- YOU KNOW THE DRAMATIC AG DOWN FOR BY THE NINE AND IS PROMPTED AS YOU MENTIONED A VARIETY OF FEDERAL AND STATE A PROPOSALS AIMED AT PROMOTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY. I NEVER RESPONSE TO- THESE PROPOSALS ARE OFFICE TO DEVELOP A FRAMEWORK FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO EVALUATE- THESE VARIOUS ACTIONS. MY PRESENTATION TODAY I WILL SUMMARIZE OUR AND THEN APPLY IT TO SOME PAUL AND A FEW ERROR- ARE FRAMEWORK GENERALLY IS A SO OF. WE THAT'S HELP FOR THOSE. TO ASK. ABOUT PROPOSAL IN AT. RISK THE FOR TWO QUESTIONS ARE MORE BY THE FACT THAT UNLIKE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHICH CAN FUND ECONOMIC STIMULUS THROUGH DEFICIT SPENDING. ANY STATE SPENDING ON AN ACTIVITY OR PROJECT COMES AT THE DIRECT COST OF REDUCE STATE SPENDING ON OTHER ACTIVITIES. AND THESE ARE SENDING REDUCTIONS CAN MAKE IT HARD TO ASSUME THAT ANY STATE SPENDING. AIMED AT GROWING THE ECONOMY WILL ULTIMATELY ACHIEVE ITS GOAL. FOR THIS REASON THERE IS A HIGH NEED FOR THE STATE TO GET THE BEST BANG FOR ITS BUCK IF YOU WILL AND SO TO DO SO WOULD BE SUGGEST. ASKING A FEW QUESTIONS- FIRST ASSEMBLY DOES THE STATE SPENDING TARGET THE PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. A MASS WHY WHAT'S THE RATIONALE FOR THIS FOCUS OVER SAY A FOCUSING ON BOOSTING CONSERVE MATERIALS AND GENERALLY OR- PROMOTING A CERTAIN- STRATEGICALLY IMPORTANT SECTOR OF THE OF THE STATE LET ME. GIVE YOU A FEW REASONS- FIRST- MANY WORKERS AND BUSINESS OWNERS THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. HAVE INVESTED A LOT OF TIME AND RESOURCES INTO BUILDING A TRADE OR BUSINESS. AND THEY COULD FACE SIGNIFICANT COSTS- IF THERE WILL TYPICALLY FORCE TO TRANSITION INTO A NEW OCCUPATION OR NEW SECTOR AS A RESULT. OF THE PANDEMIC. AND SO BECAUSE OF THIS- HELPING BUSINESS OWNERS AND WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN DISPLACED BY THE PANDEMIC RESUME THEIR PRIOR ROLES MAYBE THE QUICKEST WAY TO GET THEM BACK TO WORK IN MANY CASES- SECOND. UNLIKE PAST RECESSIONS WHICH REMARK BY A MAJOR STRUCTURAL SHIFTS IN THE ECONOMY THINK- THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE CUTBACKS IN THE EARLY NINETIES OR THE REAL THING FINANCING TRACTION DURING THE GREAT RECESSION. RIGHT NOW IT'S TOO EARLY TO TELL WHETHER THE CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WILL LEAD TO PERMANENT LONG TERM CHANGES IN THE STATE'S ECONOMY- OR WHETHER THE SLOWDOWN HAS BEEN- MORE TRANSITORY RESPONSE. TO THE EMERGENCY OF THE PANDEMIC. THE STATE MAY ULTIMATELY SEE STRUCTURAL SHIFTS AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC BUT AT THE MOMENT ANY ATTEMPT TO GAUGE WHERE THE SHIPS MIGHT OCCUR- WILL JUST BE GUESSES ARE WITH LITTLE HISTORICAL PRECEDENT TO DRAW ON- FINALLY THE DATA WE HAVE ON BUSINESS TRENDS DURING THE PANDEMIC- SUGGESTS THAT NEW BUSINESS FORMATION IN CALIFORNIA. HAS ACTUALLY QUICKLY SNAPPED BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS. AND IN ADDITION WE SEE THAT DURING TWENTY TWENTY. BUSINESS FORMATIONS IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUE TO EXCEED NATIONAL ARMS AND FOR ALL THESE REASONS WITH YOU KNOW WE SUGGEST TO FOCUS ON. TRYING TO GET ASSISTANCE AND RELIEF TO THE PEOPLE BUSINESSES WHO HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC- THE SECOND QUESTION WE SUGGEST ASKING TO ENSURE THE STATE IS GETTING THE BEST BANG FOR ITS BUCK IS WHETHER OR NOT THE STATE SPENDING ARE. A COMPLEMENTING RATHER THAN DUPLICATING FEDERAL EFFORTS- LET ME GIVE YOU A RECENT APPLICATION OF THIS PRINCIPLE IN THE RECENTLY ADOPTED GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS- THE GOVERNOR INITIALLY PROPOSED TARGETING SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS IN DIRECT PAYMENTS TO. RECIPIENTS OF THE STATE'S EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT. IN THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS ARE OFFICE SUGGESTED- THAT THE STATE PAYMENTS SHOULD BE TARGETED TO A GROUP THAT TO DATE HAD BEEN EXCLUDED. FROM THE VERY BROAD FOR RELIEF EFFORTS AND IN PARTICULAR THE- WE'RE- HE ABOUT UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS. ARE INCONSISTENT WITH THIS- THE ULTIMATE GOLDEN STATE SIMILIS A PROGRAM THAT WAS PASSED BY THE LEGISLATURE LAST MONTH INCLUDED ENHANCED RELIEF. OTHER WAS TARGETED TO UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN LEFT OUT OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS. ANOTHER SET OF QUESTIONS- THAT WE WILL OFFER ATTEMPTS TO GAUGE WHETHER THE BENEFITS OF A PROPOSAL MAYBE ALTERNATELY BE GREATER OR LESS THAN THEY MAY INITIALLY APPEAR- FIRST IS IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER HOW LARGE THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE BOTH. COST FOR STATE AGENCIES AND COST TO- APPLICANTS OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. OF AN ECONOMIC STIMULUS PROGRAM IDEALLY SHOULD BE A SMALL SHARE OF THE OVERALL COST- BUT A SMALL PROGRAM WITH A COMPLICATED ENROLLMENT PROCESS MAY HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS IN THE SKIN. DIMINISH THE AMOUNT OF FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR DELIVERING THE INTENDED BENEFITS SO THERE'S ALWAYS AN IMPORTANT TRADE OFF TO BE CONSIDERED ABOUT- YOU KNOW THE LEVEL OF DETAIL AND NUANCE THAT THE PROGRAM CAN INCORPORATE VERSES THE ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. THAT WE'RE PLACING ON PARTICIPANTS AND STATE AGENCIES- RELATEDLY WE SUGGEST TAKING ACCOUNT OF WHETHER PROPOSAL- WOULD BE A NEW OR EXISTING PROGRAM A NEW PROGRAMS WILL TAKE TIME AND RESOURCES TO SET UP AND THIS AGAIN CAN LESSEN THE OVERALL ECONOMIC BENEFITS OVER PROGRAM IN CONCERT IN CONTRAST. TO THE EXPANDING EXISTING PROGRAM OR INSTITUTION CAN BE LEVERAGED OF THESE CONCERNS ARE LESS AND- WE ALSO SUGGEST ASKING ENSURING- ARE WE AVOIDING. UNNECESSARY DUPLICATION OF EFFORT OUR BEFORE CREATING A NEW PROGRAM TO THE STATE SPEND STATE FUNDS ARE TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR POLICYMAKERS TO TAKE STOCK OF THE EXISTING A RELATED EFFORTS AT FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS- HAVING MANY SIMILAR PROGRAMS SPREAD ACROSS DIFFERENT STATE AGENCIES ARE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT- CAN BE INEFFICIENT IT CAN BE CONFUSING FOR PEOPLE OR BUSINESSES THE PROGRAMS ARE INTENDED TO BENEFIT. ARE WE ALSO SUGGEST ASKING WHETHER THE PROGRAM WILL EFFECTIVELY INCREASE PRIVATE SECTOR HIRING INVESTMENT- WHERE THE WHERE THE GOAL PROGRAM IS TO ENCOURAGE CERTAIN PRIVATE SECTOR ACTIVITIES- IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONSIDER- ENSURE THAT THE INCENTIVE PROVIDED IS LARGE ENOUGH. IMPROPERLY TARGETED TO ACTUALLY CHANGE THE DECISIONS OF PEOPLE OR BUSINESSES IN THE WAY THAT IS INTENDED. OUR WE ALSO SUGGEST ASKING A LOOKING INTO WHETHER THEIR CONSTRAINTS. IN THE RELEVANT LABOR MARKETS AND CERTAIN CONDITIONS CAN MAKE ECONOMIC STIMULUS MORE OR LESS EFFECTIVE AND INCREASING EMPLOYMENT FOR EXAMPLE- OUR PROGRAM AIMED AT STIMULUS CAN BE LESS EFFECTIVE WHEN THERE ARE CONSTRAINTS THAT WOULD MAKE HIRING FOR THE PROJECT OR PROGRAM DIFFICULT FOR EXAMPLE. IF UNEMPLOYMENT IS VERY LOW AMONG KEY OCCUPATIONS NEEDED FOR PROJECT. FINALLY I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT ARE HOW MUCH FUNDING WILL BE SPENT OUTSIDE THE STATE- BECAUSE OUR ECONOMY IS CLOSELY INTEGRATED WITH OTHER STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES I CAN BE IMPORTANT DISCUSS WHAT A PORTION. OF THE WORKERS AND MATERIALS WERE PROJECT WILL COME FROM WITHIN CALIFORNIA OF THOSE THAT USE- MORE LOCALLY SOURCED SOURCED WORKERS- OR MATERIALS I'M MORE LIKELY TO HAVE A LARGER IMPACT ON THE STATE'S ECONOMY. AT LEAST IN THE NEAR TERM. WELL THE FINAL TWO QUESTIONS IN OUR FRAMEWORK THAT WE SUGGEST CONSIDERING. AIM TO ENSURE THAT PROGRAM IS PROVIDING BENEFITS WHEN AND WHERE THE LEGISLATURE WANTS THEM. FOR SIMPLY PUT WILL THE BENEFITS TO BE REALIZED QUICKLY. IT STANDS TO REASON I THINK THAT NEW PUBLIC SPENDING IS LIKELY TO BEMORE EFFECTIVE AT STIMULATING THE ECONOMY I DURING IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE SESSION. THE RECESSION STARTED LIKE THE PERIOD THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. AND FOR THIS REASON IT'S IMPORTANT TO CAREFULLY ASSESS AND MAKE PRACTICAL SANCTIONS ABOUT WHEN. THE BENEFITS OF A PROGRAM OR PROJECT CAN BE REALIZED AND WE THINK RIGHT NOW GIVEN WHERE THE STATE IS IN IT AND IT'S RECOVERY IT'S IMPORTANT TO FOCUS ON. BENEFITS THAT CAN BE- THEY CAN BE- DISTRIBUTED INTO THE ECONOMY QUICKLY- WE ALSO SUGGEST ASKING HOW WOULD THE BENEFITS BE DISTRIBUTED ACROSS DIFFERENT- POPULATIONS AND REGIONS OF THE STATE- SOME ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM PROGRAMS TARGET INVESTMENT IN AREAS OF THE STATE WITH HIGH POVERTY AND HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT. I AM WHEN CONSIDERING A PROPOSALS LIKE THESE WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZE THE RULES AND STANDARDS USED TO IDENTIFY- THESE AREAS OF SEVERAL PAST PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN INEFFECTIVE ALONG THESE LINES BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD OVERLY BROAD OR AMBITIOUS TARGETING. ALSO IN THE VEIN OF DISTRIBUTION- WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT. OUR PROGRAMS ARE NOT EXACERBATING EXISTING INEQUITIES ACROSS COMMUNITIES ACROSS REGIONS OF THE STATE AND ONE IMPORTANT- WAY OF THINKING ABOUT TIS IS WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE- DISADVANTAGES OF CERTAIN COMMUNITIES IN ACCESSING PROGRAM FUNDS OR APPLYING FOR FUNDS. AND HOW THOSE DISADVANTAGES CAN BE TAKEN TO AN ACCOUNT IN THE IN THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS- HAVING OUTLINED ARE KIND OF OUR SET OF QUESTIONS LET ME OFFER SOME COMMENTS. ON SOME A RECENT PROPOSALS IN LIGHT OF OUR FRAMEWORK- FIRST OFFER SOME COMMENTS ON A PACKAGE OF BUSINESS TAX INCENTIVES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED AS PART OF HIS JANUARY BUDGET- THESE PROPOSALS INCLUDE A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION OF A SALES TAX EXCLUSION FOR CERTAIN EQUIPMENT PURCHASERS IS MINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA ALTERNATIVE ENERGY AND ADVANCED TRANSPORTATION FINANCING AUTHORITY OR CAVE UP. AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED MILLION FOR THE SO CALLED- MAIN STREET SMALL BUSINESS TAX CREDIT WHICH IS A HIRING CREDIT FOR BUSINESSES THAT FACE REVENUE LOSSES DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE MILLION FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMPETES PROGRAM. TO PROVIDE TWO TYPES OF ASSISTANCE AND A TRACKING OR TRAINING BUSINESSES TO CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR A NEW. GRANT PROGRAM UNDER CALIFORNIA COMPETES. AND A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR ADDITIONAL TAX CREDITS. FINALLY HE PROPOSES A NEW OPTION FOR OWNERS OF S. CORPORATIONS TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR STATE INCOME TAXES. IN A WAY THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO REDUCE THEIR FEDERAL INCOME TAX LIABILITY- AND EVALUATING THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS WE FOUND- THAT THE PROPOSAL'S TO EXPAND KATE FOR A IN CALIFORNIA COMPETES. I DO NOT OFFER BENEFITS THAT ARE WELL TARGETED TO THE BUSINESSES MOST IMPACTED. BY THE PANDEMIC- WELL SOME OF THESE PROPOSED FUNDS COULD BENEFIT FIRMS- THAT HAVE FACED CHALLENGES DURING THE PANDEMIC THE DESIGN OF THESE PROGRAMS DOES NOT EXPLICITLY TARGET A BUSINESSES MOST IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC- NOR DOES IT ENSURE THAT THOSE BUSINESSES ULTIMATELY RECEIVE FUNDING- MORE OVER SOME OF THE IMPACTED SECTORS. OF SOME OF THE MOST IMPACTED SECTORS LIKE LEAVING THE HOSPITALITY AND PERSONAL SERVICES. ARE CATEGORICALLY INELIGIBLE FOR THESE PROGRAMS. WE ALSO FIND THAT THE BENEFITS FROM THESE RIPPLES WOULD NOT BE PARTICULARLY TIMELY- IN MOST CASES THE BENEFITS ARE AWARDED TO FIRMS OVER A NUMBER OF MONTHS OR OFTEN YEARS- RELATEDLY THE PROPOSAL TO AWARD GRANTS UNDER CAL COMPETES FOR THE FIRST TIME RAISES SIGNIFICANT POLICY QUESTIONS THAT WE THINK WARRANT. CAREFUL CONSIDERATION BY THE LEGISLATURE AND MAKES THE PROPOSAL ILL SUITED. FOR THE ACCELERATED TIME'S UP THE ACCELERATEDTIMELINE- THAT WE THINK IS NECESSITATED BY THE STATE'S CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION. ON THE FLIP SIDE. THE MAIN STREET A CREDIT WE FEEL IS- PARTICULARLY WELL TARGETED TO BUSINESSES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED- AND THIS IS ALMOST BY DEFINITION OF WHAT BUSINESSES WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE CREDIT- WE THEREFORE HAVE SUGGESTED THE LEGISLATURE FOCUS RESOURCES ON EXPANDING THIS PROGRAM- AND OPTIONS TO DO SO INCLUDED ARE BROADENING THE ELIGIBILITY TO INCLUDE- NEWLY ESTABLISHED FIRMS- AND INCREASING. THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX CREDIT- PROVIDED FOR EACH NEW EMPLOYEE. ANOTHER KEY APPROACH TO SUPPORTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY THAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVEL. IS INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING- FUNCTIONING AND WELL MAINTAINED PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE IS UNDOUBTEDLY IMPORTANT TO THE STATE'S OUT LONG TERM ECONOMIC PROSPECTS. THAT BEING SAID I THINK WE WOULD REITERATE SOME POINTS- FROM A FRAMEWORK THAT I JUST OUTLINED THAT WE THINK ARE IMPORTANT WHEN THINKING ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE AS A TOOL TO SUPPORT NEAR TERM. ECONOMIC ACTIVITY. FIRST WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CAREFULLY SCRUTINIZE- HOW MANY MORE PROJECTS CAN PRACTICALLY GET STARTED WHILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAIN. DEPRESSED- LANANE PERMITTING AND DESIGN OF MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS. OFTEN TAKES YEARS TO COMPLETE AND GIVEN THE LONG TERM IMPORTANCE OF MAJOR INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS ARE RUSHING THESE PLANNING PHASES MAY NOT REALLY MAKE SENSE IN MANY CASES- AND THIS WILL LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THE STATE CAN GET INTO THE ECONOMY. IN THE NEAR TERM THROUGH NEW INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS- THAT BEING SAID. WAS THIS DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE PROCESS SHOULD NOT BE STARTED NOW- FOR WORTHWHILE PROJECTS- THAT WILL SUPPORT THE STATE'S LONG TERM ECONOMIC GROWTH. THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE IF WE DO SEE A MAJOR FEDERAL INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING PACKAGE GO FORWARD TO SUPPORT THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS AT THE STATE LEVEL- ONE OPTION THOUGH TO EXPAND INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS MORE QUICKLY OUR COULD BE TO FOCUS ON ACCELERATING NECESSARY DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT FACILITIES- ANOTHER QUESTION THAT WE WOULD POSE ABOUT- INFRASTRUCTURE IS A NEAR TERM ECONOMIC RECOVERY TOOL. IS WHETHER THE STATE HAS A STRATEGY IN PLACE TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDS IN A COORDINATED MANNER AND AVOID DUPLICATION OF EFFORT ACROSS AGENCIES- RIGHT NOW WE'RE NOT SO. CONFIDENT THAT SUBJECT A PLAN EXISTS- AND LET ME KIND OF GIVE YOU ONE EXAMPLE THAT IS DRAWN FROM A POT OF MONEY AVAILABLE UNDER THE AMERICAN A RESCUE PLAN- SPECIFICALLY THE A. R. P. INCLUDES. A TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR STATES TO DO INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS THAT DIRECTLY ENABLE. WORK EDUCATION AND HEALTH MONITORING IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC- AND WE THINK THAT THERE ARE SOME KIND OF JUST BASIC UNIT UNANSWERED QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS PART OF MONEY IN THE STATE'S ABILITY TO DEPLOY IT- SPECIFICALLY- WHICH IT'S NOT CLEAR WHICH THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE COORDINATING THE EFFORTS ACROSS STATE AGENCIES TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LEAVING ANY MONEY ON THE TABLE AND THAT PROJECTS- ARE. ARE FOLLOWING SOME SORT OF STRATEGY. WHAT TYPES OF PROJECTS CAN BE STARTED FASTER THAN OTHERS. AND IT'S ALSO NOT CLEAR HOW THE STATE PLANS TO- PRIORITIZE. ANY FEDERAL FUNDING THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE- UNDER THIS PROVISION- FINALLY WE SUGGESTS- CONSIDERING HOW THE STATE'S EXISTING INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN. BOMB CAN ALIGN WITHIN COMPLEMENT ATTENTION FEDERAL EFFORTS- FOR EXAMPLE ARE WE PRIORITIZING STATE PROJECTS. IN AREAS THAT ARE UNLIKELY TO RECEIVE FEDERAL FUNDING- SIMILAR- ARE WE MAXIMIZING OUR ELIGIBILITY AND USE OF FEDERAL FUNDS IN GENERAL- SPENDING FEDERAL FUNDING ON INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECT OR- IN THE PROGRAM IN THE STATE IS LIKELY TO RESULT IN GREATER ECONOMIC BENEFITS FOR THE STATE ECONOMY OVERALL- BECAUSE AS I MENTIONED BEFORE STATE SPENDING COMES WITH THIS THIS DIRECT TRADE OFF OF BEING AVAILABLE FOR OTHER STATE PROGRAMS- SIMILARLY WE SUGGEST CONSIDERING. HOW THE STATE HOW DOES THE STRATEGY ALSO CAN BESTCOMPLEMENT LOCAL INFRASTRUCTURE EFFORTS- SO WITH THAT- THAT KIND OF CONCLUDES MY SUMMARY OF OUR OUR FRAMEWORK AND ITS APPLICATION AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTER YOUR FOR JOINING US TODAY AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING SOME KEY QUESTIONS SUGGESTIONS THAT WE SHOULD BE ASKRI ASKING AND CONSIDERING. I WILL START OFF WELL MAYBE WITH THE QUESTIONER TO AND GIVES OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS AN OPPORTUNITY TO JOIN AND START. AS WE LOOK AT- JUST DISPARITIES AND ACCESSIBLE WHAT DO YOU RECOMMEND AS TO WHAT ACTIONS THE LEGISLATURE THE ADMINISTRATION CAN TAKE TO REALLY MITIGATE THE DISPARITIES. AMONG DIFFERENT BUSINESS OWNER GROUPS I'D SAY WOMEN BUSINESS OWNERS ARE BUSINESSES LOCATED IN RURAL COMMUNITIES HE- YEAH- SO I THINK THAT THERE'S A FEW OPTIONS- YOU KNOW HIGHLIGHTING A FEW POINTS FROM FROM THE FRAMEWORK OUTLINED I THINK ONE THING- THAT THAT CAN BE AN IMPORTANT TOOL IS. HAVING TARGETING OF PROGRAMS OR PRIORITIZATION OF- TECHNOMIC DEVELOPER PROGRAMS BASED ON. WHETHER OR NOT BUSINESSES ARE LOCATED AND HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES- YOU KNOW AND I THINK A LOT OF PROGRAMS AS I MENTIONED I'VE HAD THOSE KINDS OF- PARAMETERS IN THE PAST- IT'S IMPORTANT- THAT YOU KNOW THE WERE SURE THAT THE MORE PUTTING THIS PRIMARIES IN PLACE THOUGH- SINCE YOU KNOW DEFINING THOSE THINGS I NARROWLY ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY IDENTIFY. A PROPERLY IDENTIFY GROUPS THAT ARE MOST IN NEED OF ASSISTANCE- OFTEN THERE CAN BE A TEMPTATION TO DEFINE THOSE- THOSE PARAMETERS VERY A PROBABLY- SO THE FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO MANY PARTS OF THE STATE- INSTEAD OF KIND OF TARGETED AT THAT THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ANOTHER- THREE FOUR ONE IS- ENSURING. THAT ANY ANY PROGRAM THAT DOES HAVE- INVOLVED APPLICATION PROCESS. THERE IS FUNDING SET ASIDE FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR US SMALLER COMMUNITIES ARE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ALSO- OFTEN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE FUNDING FOR- OUR RECENT OUT REACH AND AN EDUCATION FOR BUSINESS OWNERS TO- YOU KNOW WE MAY YOU KNOW MAY MAY NOT HAVE. THE TIME OR RESOURCES TO BE STAYING APPRISED OF ALL YOU KNOW THE KIND OF STATE PROGRAMS THAT MAY BE AVAILABLE TO THEM. THANK YOU MISTER YOU ARE I WILL TURN IT OVER TO. MY RIGHT TO SOMEONE NUMBER BOERNER HORVATH. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- WHEN WE LOOK AT THE TARGETED STIMULUS TO THOSE YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SAID IN YOUR REPORT WHO MAY BE LESS PREPARED TO COMPETE FOR THIS TARGET IS TENUOUS. AT THIS POINT WHAT ARE THE TOP FIVE REASONS OF REGIONS SORRY ONE OF THE FIVE TOP FIVE REGIONS AND INDUSTRIAL CLASSIFICATIONS YOU THINK CAN MOST BENEFIT FROM TARGET STIMULUS IN CALIFORNIA SO IF WE WERE TO BREAK IT DOWN FOR US. WHAT ARE YOUR TOP FIVE. TOP FIVE- I THINK ON THE REGIONAL PEACE I HONESTLY WOULD- I THINK I WOULD HAVE TO I THINK YOU HAVE TO GET BACK ON THE REGIONAL PEACE ON THE SECTORS- I THINK I GUESS IT DEPENDS A LITTLE BIT ON WHAT LEVEL OF INDUSTRIAL CODE- BUT I THINK- FAR AWAY THE THIS THE SECTORS THAT HAVE BEEN. SEEN THE GREATEST IMPACT FROM THE PANDEMIC AND CONTINUE TO SEE THE GREATEST DECLINES IN EMPLOYMENT AND DECLINES IN BUSINESS OUR RECEIPTS. ARE IN LEISURE AND HOSPITALITY- ARTS AND RECREATION AND PERSONAL SERVICES. THAT GROUP BEING- THEY'RE THEY'RE OBVIOUSLY LOTS OF BUSINESSES IN THAT HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC BUT I THINK THAT BUSINESSES IN THOSE SECTORS- THEY CONTINUE TO SEE KIND OF DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACTS ROLE RELATIVE TO OTHER GROUPS AND I MEAN I WOULD BE. HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH- WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AFTERWARDS TO- TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL ON THE ON THE REGIONAL QUESTION SORRY I DON'T I DON'T HAVE KIND OF AT HAND. SOME SOME DETAILED INFORMATION ON THE REGIONAL PEACE. YEAH SO THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF YOU COULD FOLLOW UP AND SPECIFICALLY WHAT WOULD BE INTERESTING IS THE OVERLAP OF THE SECTORS IN THE REGION'S FOR TARGETED STIMULUS SO THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. THANK YOU MISTER YOU ARE. LET ME GO AHEAD AND JUST QUICKLY ASK REQUIRE AS A RELATES TO ALL OF THE FEDERAL AND STATE LOAN PROGRAMS THAT ARE OUT THERE. HAVE YOU HAD A CHANCE TO IDENTIFY ANY GAPS IN FINANCING BEING OFFERED WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF ELIGIBILITY AND CRITERIA AND REQUIREMENTS ARE THERE CERTAIN LOANS. I SIZE THOSE THAT ARE BEING LEFT OUT. ALONG. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THAT'S A THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I THINK THAT- THE LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS- IS AN AREA THAT OUR OFFICE- IS KIND OF I THINK HOPING TO. TO DRILL DOWN INTO A LITTLE MORE IN THE COMING MONTHS- IN LIGHT OF- KIND OF A COLLECTION OF PROPOSALS THE GOVERNOR'S FORWARD- FOR SOME. LOAN GUARANTEE PROGRAMS THROUGH- THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS. OUR GOAL IS SORRY- AND- SO YOU KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF PROGRAMS THERE WITH LOTS OF DIFFERENT MOVING PIECES. YOU KNOW I THINK I DON'T HAVE A GOOD ANSWER FOR YOU RIGHT NOW AND IF THERE ARE CLEAR- GROUPS THAT ARE BEING LEFT OUT- I KNOW THAT LIKE A KEY. OBJECTIVE OF SOME OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS HAS BEEN TO TARGET- GROUPS WHO ARE NOT AVAILABLE OR ARE NOT ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SOME OF THE LARGER FEDERAL PROGRAMS- LIKE- PPP OR IDLE- ARE RIGHT NOW- I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT EARLY TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT SOME OF THOSE EFFORTS BY. THE GOVERNOR AND THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE ACHIEVED THEIR GOAL OF ACTUALLY TARGETING THOSE POPULATIONS. THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS- BUT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE THEY CAN CONTINUE TO MONITOR PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THE LEGISLATURE YOU KNOW DURING BUDGET DELIBERATIONS ON THOSE PROPOSALS. UNDERSTAND I BELIEVE MATH PETRIE-NORRIS. THANK YOU CARE. HI AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY AND- FOR YOUR ANALYSIS PARTICULARLY ON ASTHMA THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS. I THINK I WAS PARTICULARLY STRUCK BY YOUR COMMENTS I REGARDING JUST THE LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE OR COORDINATION AVAILABLE AT THE STATE LEVEL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS- YOU HIGHLIGHTED A NUMBER OF GAP SOME POTENTIAL ISSUES AND- AND HURDLES. DO YOU HAVE ANY PROPOSALS OR SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO BETTER COORDINATE. THAT TYPE OF THAT THAT TYPE OF SPENDING. YEAH I MEAN I THINK- THAT. YOU KNOW THE STATE HAS A INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN THAT WAS RELEASED AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUT- OF RELEASE ALONG WITH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THIS YEAR- AND YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THERE IS THERE ARE SOME OPPORTUNITIES- TO POTENTIALLY- AND ABOUT WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BRING THE ADMINISTRATION AND ASK THEM TO- EVALUATE THAT STRATEGY ONLINE AS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT WE RAISED I THINK- YOU KNOW ASKING THEM TO AYE. YOU KNOW IDENTIFY IN PARTICULAR HOW THE PROJECTS AND THE STRATEGIES THAT HAVE BEEN OUTLINED PLAN- YOU KNOW BASICALLY ASKING THEM TO SUPPLEMENT THAT PLAN WITH INFORMATION ABOUT. HOW THE PLAN COULD OVERLAP- WITH- FEDERAL BILLS THAT ARE COMING IN AND WHAT STRATEGIES THE ADMINISTRATION SUGGEST PUTTING IN PLACE FOR- ENSURING THAT WE'RE DRAWING DOWN THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING FOR THOSE PROJECTS- SO YOU KNOW I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION HAS HAS. STARTED SOME OF THE WORK ALONG HIS LINES- BUT IT'S NOT CLEAR TO US THAT. YOU KNOW AT THE MOMENT THAT A LOT OF THOUGHT HAS BEEN GIVEN TO- HOW HOW THE STATE'S PLAN. WOOD INTERACT WITH- YOU KNOW CONTENT PROPOSED FEDERAL ACTIONS AND HOW WE'RE ENSURING THAT WE'RE MAXIMIZING THOSE DOLLARS. AND IF I UNDERSTOOD YOU CORRECTLY ARE BIG AND IMPORTANTLY MISSING PIECE IS GOOD CLEAR OWNERSHIP. AND RESPONSIBILITY FOR DECISION MAKING AND EXECUTION ACROSS WITH IT INSTEAD OF HAVING DIFFUSE RESPONSIBILITY SCATTERED ACROSS A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT AGENCIES. YEAH YEAH THAT'S RIGHT I HAD AN KIND OF ON IT THE SIMILAR VEIN I. THINK ONE THING THAT I'VE BEEN REALLY STRUCK BY BAD THROUGHOUT THE COURSE OF OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE HAS BEEN ANOTHER THING THAT SEEMS IMPORTANTLY MISSING WHICH IS KIND OF A REAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. AGENCY FOR THE STATE SO IF I UNDER THE DAVIS ADMINISTRATION WHAT WAS IT CALLED THE FOR THE CALIFORNIA TECHNOLOGY TRADE AND COMMERCE AGENCY WAS ELIMINATED AND WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AS A RESULT A- FIVE. AND THAT THE FULL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT INFRASTRUCTURE ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT YOU IN LA- HAVE DISCUSSED ARE THERE OPPORTUNITIES THERE ARE OTHER THINGS THAT THAT WE'RE- MISSING AS A RESULT OF THAT. WELL YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I THINK THAT THE ADMINISTRATION MIGHT SUGGEST. THAT THEY GO BUSINESS CURRENTLY SERVING THAT ROLE AND I THINK MAYBE IN A LOT OF RESPECTS- THEY ARE I THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW- SO YEAH I MEAN I THINK THAT THAT THEY GO IS YOU KNOW- FILLING THAT ROLE TO A LARGE EXTENT- FOR THE STATE- YOU KNOW I THINK MAYBE ONE THING- ONE YOU KNOW POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITY SO TO LOOK AT GOING FORWARD- WITH GO BIZ OR OR- YOU KNOW POTENTIALLY WITH SOME OTHER STATE AGENCY- IS THE- THE EXTENT TO WHICH- THE STATE IS. IS WORKING WITH LOCALS- TO- WORKING WITH LOCALS TO- WORKING ALONGSIDE LOCAL SORRY WITH THEIR LOCAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS- TO AGAIN ENSURE YOU KNOW HOW WHAT WHAT THINGS CAN THE STATE DO SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS HOW CAN WE GET HOW CAN WE ENSURE THAT THERE ISN'T- DUPLICATION OF EFFORT ACROSS THE STATE AND LOCAL PROGRAMS AND MAYBE EVEN TO SOME EXTENT IN THE STATE PLAY A ROLE- AND MAYBE EVEN SOME REGIONAL COORDINATION OF THOSE THOSE LOCAL EFFORTS TO MAYBE ENSURE THAT THERE IS AN- UNHEALTHY COMPETITION HAPPENING AMONGST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. GOT IT AB ONE LAST QUESTION AND AS WE TALKED ABOUT THAT WHAT IS IT TWO WEEKS AGO AND THE LEGISLATURE PASSED IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A SEVEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE YOU TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE SPECIFIC ELEMENTS THAT WERE INCLUDED AS PART OF THAT WERE THERE ANY SPECIFIC POLICY PROPOSALS THAT THAT ENDED UP ON THE CUTTING ROOM FLOOR THAT YOU OR THE L. A. O. WOULD. LIKE TO ENCOURAGE US TO CONSIDER FOR A SUBSEQUENT POTENTIAL INVESTMENT ACTIONS. I THINK THAT RIGHT NOW- THE THING THAT OUR OFFICE IS HIGHLIGHTED AS- KIND OF THE MOST IMPORTANT- ACTIONS FOR THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION TO BE FOCUSING ON IN TERMS OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY I THINK THEY STILL REMAIN- IN THE VEIN OF SUPPORTING THE KIND OF JUST THE OVERALL PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE- WE THINK. KIND OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THE STATE CAN DO FOR BUSINESSES RIGHT NOW- IS TO CONTINUE CONTINUE TO ENSURE AN ORDERLY- ROLLOUT OF THE VACCINES CONTINUE TESTING- TO. CONTINUE TO WORK WITH. INDUSTRY GROUPS TO ENSURE THAT THAT REGULATIONS ADAPT TO THE CHANGING SITUATIONS THAT ARE ALLOWING BUSINESSES. TO COME BACK INTO THEIR OPERATIONS- SO- FOCUSING ON- WHERE. ADDITIONAL SPENDING MAY BE NEEDED FOR VACCINE- DEPLOYMENT FOR- FOR SUPPORTING BUSINESSES TO. REOPEN OPERATIONS- I THINK THOSE ARE KIND OF THE KEY THE KEY AREAS FOR SUPPORTING ECONOMIC RECOVERY GOING FORWARD. I THANK COULDN'T AGREE MORE THANK YOU SO MUCH I MISTER YOU ARE WITH JUST A I APPRECIATE YOUR TIME BEING WITH US THIS MORNING AND LOOK FORWARD TO SOME OF THE FOLLOW UP- THAT WILL BE HAVING. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME LET ME GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO OUR NEXT AGENDA ITEM- LET ME. JUST GIVE A BRIEF FRAMEWORK FOR AGENDA ITEM FOR AS MANY OF YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE STATE'S IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FEDERAL WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT. THE BOARD ALSO PROVIDES ADVICE TO THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE AND JOURNAL THERE'S GENERALLY SERVES AS THE STATE'S PRIMARY PLACE AWARE LABOR BUSINESS AND INDUSTRY AS WELL AS EDUCATION STAKEHOLDERS COME TOGETHER. COVER NINETY DISPLACING EXTREME CHALLENGES ON OUR WORK FORCE COMMUNITY JUST BASED ON NUMBERS RELEASED ON FRIDAY THERE ARE ONE POINT SIX MILLION UNEMPLOYED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA WITH OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND AND NATIONAL YOU AYE OR PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTING CLAIMS. ARE BEING FILED LAST WEEK. SO THIS IS ONE OF THOSE AREAS WERE GOING BACK TO PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS I CAN NOT BE OUR GOALS. MORE THAN HALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR WORKFORCE HAPPY LASSEN A BACHELORS DEGREE. AND MORE STAGNATION IN WAGES HAVE PLACED NEARLY 18% OF THE HOUSEHOLDS IN CALIFORNIA. LIVING ON POVERTY LEVEL INCOMES WE MUST BUILD BACK BETTER. ONE THING IN OUR FAVOR IS THAT THE GOVERNOR WAS AND IS KEENLY AWARE OF THE CALIFORNIA'S WORKPLACE CHALLENGES. MOST RECENTLY HIS FUTURE WORK COMMISSION RELEASED. A REPORT WITH RECOMMENDATIONS TO SUPPORT LONG TERM ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AND BY THE SUMMER- THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD WILL HAVE A WORKFORCE STRATEGY. TO PROVIDE A JUST TRANSITION TO A LOWER CARBON ECONOMY. SO WITH THAT LET'S GO HEADING HERE FROM TIMBER RAINY OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD. I TIM WHEN YOU ARE READY TO BEGIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM CHAIR I HOPE YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY. YES WE CAN. THE TRAFFIC- OPENING I COULDN'T SAID IT BETTER MYSELF- AND I'LL TRY NOT TO REPEAT WHAT YOU SAID BUT BUT BUILT ON IT- AND I'LL BE BRIEF- BECAUSE I WANNA LEAVE TIME FOR QUESTIONS M. AND ALSO BECAUSE ARE MUCH SMARTER PEOPLE ON THE PANEL. THAT COMES AFTER ME AND MY FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES RON MILLER LANCE HASTINGS. SO I'LL QUICKLY COVER WHERE I THINK WE ARE- WHERE WE NEED TO BE AND IDEAS ON HOW TO GET TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. AND WORKING FROM SECRETARY SHOES- AND THE GOVERNOR'S VISION FOR HIRING RECOVERY SECRETARY SEE WHO I SEND MY- ALL MY ENERGY TO BECAUSE SHE'S. ON CAPITOL HILL RIGHT NOW. IN THE MIDDLE OF SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARING SO I WISH HER THE ABSOLUTE BEST. I'M AND IT MAYBE TOOK OFF A FEW OPPORTUNITIES IF I CAN'T SO WHERE WE ARE. IN NOT TO REPEAT. EVERYTHING THAT MR MUELLER WELL LAID OUT IN HIS PRESENTATION ECONOMIC SHOCK. OF THE PANDEMIC HIT. AS WE ALL KNOW THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS THE HARDEST IMMIGRANTS PEOPLE OF COLOR. LOW INCOME WORKERS WOMEN. IN THE PANDEMIC DIDN'T CREATE THESE UNJUST. CONDITIONS AS YOU POINTED OUT MADAM CHAIR- BUT IT EXACERBATED THOSE IT LAID BARE THESE. DEEP INEQUITIES IN OUR ECONOMY. SO I THINK THE STRUCTURAL PROBLEM BECAUSE THAT WAS A QUESTION THAT WAS RAISED. OR A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM AN IMPORTANT ONE THAT WE WANT TO FOCUS ON THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON IS THAT THE NUMBER OF GOOD QUALITY JOBS IN CALIFORNIA. THAT NUMBER IS FAR LESS THAN THAN THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO NEED GOOD. JOBS THE TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH. I THINK IS INADEQUATE. WE TEND TO. APPROACH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT IN A WAY THAT LOOKS KIND KIND OF FROM A PROGRAM CENTRIC PERSPECTIVE- WE TRAIN WE PROVIDE EMPLOYMENT SERVICES- AND THEN WE SEND PEOPLE OUT IN LABOR MARKETS KIND OF ON THEIR OWN IN HOPES THAT THEY CONNECT TO IT. A GOOD QUALITY JOB. WE HOPE THAT WE'VE GIVEN HIM THE WHERE WITH ALL TO BE COMPETITIVE ENOUGH TO LAND A GOOD JOB. PRESIDENT OBAMA WHEN HE SIGNED THAT WORKFORCE INNOVATION OPPORTUNITY ACT. CALL THAT RAINING PRICE WHICH I USE A LOT I THINK IT SUMS IT UP. IN THE MICRO SENSE. THAT WORKS OUT AND WE THINK ABOUT IT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT SITE IS THAT YOU GIVE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WALKS IN THE DOOR A LEG UP IN A COMPETITIVE LABOR MARKET UP FOR GOOD QUALITY JOB THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. AND THAT DOES WORK IN IN IN THAT INDIVIDUAL'S CASE IN THE MACRO IT DOESN'T WORK- BECAUSE WE'RE BUILDING COMPETITION FOR TOO FEW JOBS THAT'S A STRUCTURAL PROBLEM AND IN THE END WHEN WE'RE SUCCESSFUL AT BUILDING COMPETITION FOR TOO FEW JOBS- WE HAVE A DOWNWARD EFFECT ON ON WAGES SO YOU REALLY HAVE TO LINK UP WORKFORCE AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT IN VERY INTENTIONAL WAY- AND OF COURSE AS YOU AS YOU WELL KNOW. THERE ARE VERY REAL HISTORICAL IMPACTS OF PRIVILEGE RACE AND GENDER ARE UNTRUE AND WHAT GROUPS WIN OUT IN THE CONTEXT OF COMPETITION FOR TOO FEW A GOOD QUALITY JOBS SO WHERE DO WE NEED TO BE. THE AS- IF YOU ARE I THINK POINTED FOR THE RECOVERY IS NOT TO RETURN TO THE SAME ECONOMIC INJUSTICES AND INEQUITIES OF THE PAST BUT TO COME OUT STRONGER MORE EQUITABLE AND MORE RESILIENT- WE KNOW THAT. EQUITY WE KNOW THAT SHARED PROSPERITY A CALIFORNIA FOR ALL AS THE GOVERNOR SAYS. IS GOOD FOR THE ECONOMY BROADLY WHEN PEOPLE EARN MORE WHEN THEY HAVE GREATER INCOME SECURITY WHEN THEY HAVE ACCESS TO ONGOING SKILLS TRAINING AND EDUCATION AND THE ABILITY TO BE MOBILE AND ROCK. ARE GREATER INCOME SECURITY AS A RESULT OF THAT. THAT'S GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES IT'S VERY GOOD FOR FAMILY STRENGTHENS FAMILIES- AND IT'S GREAT FOR BUSINESS- HOW DO WE GET THERE ARE. YOU THERE THERE ARE THREE KIND OF MAIN CATEGORIES THAT THAT WE THINK ABOUT WHAT WE'VE GOT TO REALLY BE INTENTIONAL ONE IS TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY JOBS. THROUGH EDUCATION TRAINING BUT ALSO PARTNERSHIPS WITH INDUSTRY. CREATE MORE GOOD JOBS- THROUGH INVESTMENTS INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER WAYS CREEK JUST INCREASE THE NUMBER OF JOBS RELATIVE GOOD JOBS RELATIVE TO THE NUMBER OF BAD JOBS. AND THE NUMBER THREE IS TO IMPROVE EXISTING JOBS. AND I THINK THE TECHNICAL TERM IS TO TURN CRAPPIE JOBS AND GOOD JOBS BUT I WON'T USE THAT TECHNICAL TERM. THE HYBRID APPROACH IS WHAT WE APPLY TO THIS AND IT'S- I USE IN THE IN THE CONTEXT OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S OFTEN. HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT BUT IT'S ALSO APPLICABLES MORE BROADLY I THINK THE CONTRACTING AND PROCUREMENT. AND HOW WE THINK ABOUT INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. THE HYBRID APPROACH. THAT IS A SPECIFIC AN EMERGING FIELD OF PRACTICE IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND HAS. FOUR MAIN PILLARS THAT ARE QUICKLY TALK ABOUT. THE FIRST JOB QUALITY SECOND IS- IS WORKER VOICE THIRTIES EQUITY IN THE LAST SIX CLIMATE ON JOB QUALITY. THIS IS TURNING THE TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT APPROACH KIND OF ON ITS HEAD UPSIDE DOWN SO YOU DON'T START WITH PROGRAMS YOU KNOW PUSH PEOPLE OUT LABOR MARKETS INSTEAD YOU START WITH THE BEST QUALITY JOBS. IN INDUSTRY SECTORS THAT ARE DRIVING REGIONAL EMPLOYMENT. IN THE DNA OF THIS HYBRID APPROACH IS DEEP INDUSTRY ENGAGEMENT. THAT CREATES THE CONDITIONS BOTH FOR WORKERS TRANSMIT ON THE JOB MOVING PEOPLE UP. AND ALSO ACCESS TO QUALITY JOBS FOR NEW HIRES. ESPECIALLY COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY JOBS TRADITIONALLY. THE SECOND IS WORKER VOICE IN AGENCY ON THE JOB ESPECIALLY AS JOBS IN INDUSTRIES CHANGE. DUE TO CLIMATE AUTOMATION AND COVIDIEN PACKS OF COKE WORKERS IN COMMUNITIES WERE MOST IMPACTED NEED A SEAT AT THE TABLE ARE IN CO DOT CO DESIGNING. THE FUTURE WORK AND THEN FINALLY NOT FINALLY EQUITY TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AS I AS I SAID FOCUS ON POPULATIONS. WELL I DIDN'T SAY THIS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT POINT OUT TRADITIONAL WORKFORCE PROGRAMS FOCUS ON POPULATIONS WITH BEARS TO EMPLOYMENT SO WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS. SOCIAL SERVICES PROGRAMS COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO ME BASED ORGANIZATIONS WERE VERY MISSION DRIVEN UP ALREADY ARE ARE TARGETING THOSE WORKERS WHO HAVE. WHO NEED A GOOD JOB THE MOST BUT ALSO NEED THE MOST HELP TO GET THERE. ARE HOWEVER. TO ACHIEVE EQUITY. YOU CAN'T JUST WORK ON THE SUPPLY SIDE ON WHAT WORKERS NEED YOU HAVE TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO JOB QUALITY BECAUSE OF LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE UNDER EMPLOYED UNEMPLOYED OR WORKING HARD TO STATE JUST ABOVE POVERTY OFTEN WORKING MORE THAN ONE JOB. DON'T NEED ACCESS TO. ANOTHER LOW WAGE JOB THAT'S DEAD AND WHAT THEY NEED ACCESS TO YOU IS A GOOD QUALITY JOBS SO THAT'S GOT TO BE OUR FOCUS IF YOU. IF YOU WANT TO ACHIEVE EQUITY ABSOLUTELY HAVE TO PAY ATTENTION TO JOB QUALITY- AND WE DON'T WORKFORCE PROGRAMS IN A WAY THAT PULL PEOPLE INTO GOOD QUALITY JOBS INSTEAD OF PUSHING PEOPLE INTO LABOR MARKETS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES AND THEN FINALLY A CLIMATE SO FOCUS ON INDUSTRIES. OCCUPATIONS WORKERS. AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY CLIMATE- BUT ALSO WORKERS INDUSTRIES AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISRUPTED BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND ALSO CHANGES IN OUR TECHNOLOGY AND AUTOMATION SO NOT VERY QUICKLY I'LL WRAP UP WITH JUST A FEW OPPORTUNITIES. WERE REALLY PUSHING. HARD TO BUILD MORE SECTOR BASED HYBRID TRAIN PARTNERSHIPS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSAL ASK FOR TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO THE STATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO BUILD MORE HIRING ROAD TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS OUT THERE- WE HAVE TWENTY TWO WOULD CALL EACH OR TNCS HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS. IN SECTORS THAT ARE AS DIVERSE AS HOSPITALITY TRADE AND LOGISTICS. AND CONSTRUCTION- WE ALSO HAVE ELEVEN FIRA CONSTRUCTION CREWS PARTNERSHIPS THAT ARE IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONNECT COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS WHO HAVEN'T HAD ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY JOBS. GIVE THEM ACCESS TO STATE APPROVED APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS IN THE TRADES AS WE BUILD OUR BECAUSE OUR INVESTING IS DIMINISHED WE HAVE NOW A MECHANISM TO GET PEOPLE ACCESS TO. SOME OF THE BEST MIDDLE CLASS JOBS THAT DON'T REQUIRE A COLLEGE DEGREE. AND THOSE ARE PARTNERSHIPS IN EVERY REGION BETWEEN BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS THE TRADES- WORKFORCE BOARDS COLLEGES AND UNIVERSAL CONDITIONS I THINK. ABOUT MR MILLER WILL TALK MORE ABOUT THAT. THE SECOND IS PROCUREMENT CONTRACTING IS A SAID APPLYING THOSE PRINCIPLES OF HIGH ROAD- AND THEN FINALLY THE FEDERAL. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. RE REALIZING THE STIMULUS IMPACTS OF THE RECOVERY MONEY. MEANS CREATING PATHWAYS TO GOOD JOBS THAT ARE CREATED FOR THE PEOPLE. WHO MOST NEED THOSE GOOD JOBS AND I'LL I THINK I'LL LEAVE IT THERE IN THE INTEREST OF TIME. THANK YOU SO MUCH RESTRAINING YOU TOUCHED ON SO MANY KEY ISSUES THAT WE DISCUSSED ARE VERY VERY OFTEN- WITHIN THIS BODY AND ALSO WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. I DO HAVE A QUICK QUESTION AS IT RELATES TO OUR TRANSITION TO A LOWER CARBON ECONOMY HOW DO YOU SEE. THE STATE'S TRANSITION TO LOWER CARBON ECONOMY- IMPACTING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AND OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT NEEDS. YEAH IT'S A IT'S DIRECTLY RELATED SO WHAT WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO DO IS LOOKING AT THOSE SECTORS KNOWS COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY OUR MOVE TO WE HAVE A VERY AGGRESSIVE IN GENTING CALIFORNIA TO MOVE TO- NET ZERO- A CARBON TAX SO THAT MEANS MANUFACTURING CONSTRUCTION TRADE LOGISTICS REALLY EVERY SECTOR IN THE ECONOMY. IS GOING TO BE NEEDING TO TRANSITION- AND THAT MEANS ALSO BUILDING A WORKFORCE THAT CAN MAKE THAT TRANSITION TO- AND I WILL POINT OUT THAT MUCH OF THAT FOCUS IS GOING TO BE ON MANUFACTURING THAT SECTOR- WHICH IS ALREADY IN IN IN A PROCESS OF CHANGE I LOOKS VERY YEARS AGO I THINK MISTER HASTINGS WILL TALK ABOUT THAT. IT ALSO CONSTRUCTION MOST OF THE JOBS BETTER HE IN CENTRAL TO- MITIGATING CLIMATE CHANGE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE TRADITIONAL TRADES SO OUR INTENTION AROUND CREATING ACCESS TO THOSE JOBS IN THE TRADES IS VERY DIRECTLY RELATED TO OUR OUR SHIFT TO CLIMATE RESILIENCY- AND I THINK YOU JUST REAL QUICKLY IN ADDITION TO THAT AS WE LOOK AT HOW DO INVESTORS INFRASTRUCTURE DOLLARS COMING IN FROM THE FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WILL CREATE NEW JOBS. IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES AND I THINK IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR US. AS A STATE TO IMPACT EMPLOYMENT KIND OF LIKE WE USED TO DO- WITH GOVERNMENT STIMULUS INVESTMENTS REALLY BEING INTENTIONAL ABOUT IMPACTING ONE. I'M LOOKING AT EARLIER THIS MONTH WE KNOW THAT THE FUTURE WORK COMMISSION RELEASED ITS REPORT AND- ARE THERE PARTICULAR RECOMMENDATIONS AT THIS COMMITTEE SHOULD BE REVIEWING AS THEY WERE AS IT RELATES TO INCLUSIVE ECONOMIC RECOVERY- YEAH I IT'S A GREAT REPORT AND I REALLY ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO GO TO THE LABOR AGENCIES WEBSITE THERE'S A LINK TO THE TO THE REPORT- ON ON THE WEBSITE. L. W. D. EIGHT NO I'M SORRY IT'S LABOR DOT CA DOT GOP- I THINK THE BASIC PREMISE OF THE FUTURE WORK COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS IS NOT WHAT I SAID BEFORE. THAT YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE EQUITY WHICH IS A FOCUS OF THE STATE IN GETTING TO. AN INCLUSIVE HIGH ROAD RECOERY YOU CAN'T ACHIEVE THAT AN EQUITY WE DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO JOB QUALITY SO THEIR NUMBER OF RECOMMENDATIONS IN THERE INCLUDING INVESTING AND HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS THAT GIVE THAT QUESTION OF JOB. JOB QUALITY. I WANT TO MAKE SURE TURN IT TO ANY OF MY- OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME HE- IT IF PETRIE-NORRIS. HI AB TWENTY THANKS SO MUCH FOR JOINING US TODAY. SO I FEEL LIKE THERE IS A HUGE AND I'M SURE WHO CREATE UNREALIZED OPPORTUNITY FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE STATE SO AND THE FOR THE PANDEMIC I THINK YOU YOU POINTED OUT THAT THERE'S TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS COMPETING FOR TOO FEW GOOD JOBS. BUT WE ARE ALSO SEEING JOB GROWTH SLOWING NOT BECAUSE THERE WEREN'T ENOUGH GOOD JOBS WITH BECAUSE THE SKILLS OF OUR LABOR MARKET. AREN'T AT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE FOR TODAY'S INCREASINGLY TECHNOLOGY DRIVEN ECONOMY SO I THINK THERE'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR US. TO INVEST IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE FORGING THIS INCLUSIVE RECOVERY AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE BUILDING BACK BETTER WHICH IS CERTAINLY. A GOAL THAT WE ALL SHARE. I GUESS I WOULD LOVE TO UNDERSTAND FROM YOUR AND YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT ARE THE CONSTRAINTS RIGHT NOW HI IN TERMS OF OUR ABILITY TO INVEST MORE IN. IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND GET MORE. GET MORE FROM FROM THE PROGRAMS THAT YOU'RE RENTING IS IT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING IS IT THAT THERE'S NOT ENOUGH GREAT IDEAS- THERE'S NOT ENOUGH WELL FORMED PROGRAMS OR- WHAT'S WHAT'S THE MISSING PIECE. AND HOW CAN WE HELP FILL IN THOSE DAYS THAT THERE'S GAPS. YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH AT SUCH A GREAT QUESTION- I THERE ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER AND I'LL JUST. I'LL TALK ABOUT A COUPLE- ONE IS ALIGNMENT OF WORKFORCE PROGRAMS- BOTH AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. SO WE DO HAVE A OF A LARGE INVESTMENT IN EDUCATION FOR ANY WORK FOR SERVICES IN THE STATE- IT AMOUNTS TO ABOUT SIX BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY- AND- BUT- A BIG CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE ADDRESSING VERY DIRECTLY BOTH THE IN SACRAMENTO. AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS THE ALIGNMENT AMONG ALL THOSE DIFFERENT SORT OF- INITIATIVES PROGRAMMES AND INTERVENTIONS. SO THAT WE'RE GETTING GREATER SCALE AND IMPACT OF THOSE OUT SO THAT MEANS- WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS INSIDE THE LABOR AGENCY BECAUSE WE HAVE THREE DIFFERENT APARTMENTS FOR RATHER INSIDE LABOR YOU SEE THAT ARE- IN CHARGE OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS OF WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- AND- YOU MAY HAVE SEEN THE PROPOSAL IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR NEW- NEED WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. I'M SO THAT'S ONE WAY. AT THE STATE LEVEL BUT ALSO WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BECAUSE A LARGE SAID INVESTMENT. IN SKILLS TRAINING IS ACTUALLY THROUGH THE COMMITTEE COLLEGE SYSTEM. INSERT AND IS WELL AS OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT THAT. MANAGE AND ADMINISTER WHAT FIRST DOLLARS. AND WE DON'T DO THAT BECAUSE WE- BECAUSE WE PROVIDE SERVICES FROM SACRAMENTO IN FACT ALL THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED LOCALLY AT THE POINT OF SERVICE DELIVERY WHERE PEOPLE MOST NEED HELP AND WHAT BUSINESSES NEED HELP. SO THAT ALIGNMENT IN SACRAMENTO IS GOING TO HELP- MAKE THE ALIGNMENT ON THE GROUND AMONG SERVICES. MORE SEAMLESS SO THAT COMPANIES AND WORKERS. ARE FACING NOT A COMPLEX PATCHWORK OF PROGRAMS BUT ACTION BUT INSTEAD. A NAVIGABLE KIND OF MORE SEAMLESS I WORK FOR SYSTEM THAT THEY CAN GET THE MOST BENEFIT FROM SO I THINK THE FIRST ONE IS IT IS ALIGNMENT THE SECOND ONE IS. SIX BILLION DOLLARS SOUNDS LIKE A LOT BUT IT'S NOT ENOUGH- CALIFORNIA'S A THREE TRILLION DOLLAR ECONOMIES WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WAYS TO REALLY SMARTLY. INVEST MORE DOLLARS I THINK THIS STIMULUS IS GONNA GIVE US A GREAT OPPORTUNITY. TO INVEST IN THINGS THAT WE KNOW WILL WORK BEST NOT LIKE THESE HIRING TRAINING PARTNERSHIPS- IN ADDITION TO THAT. BECAUSE WORK TARGETING UP UP. POPULATIONS THAT ARE MOST VULNERABLE- WE NEED TO BE. ABLE TO INVEST IN WHAT WE CALL SUPPORTIVE SERVICES- SO TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE REALLY GREAT THEY'RE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT OUT SOME OF THE BEST APPRENTICESHIP. BUT- BUT WORKERS WHO ARE. SUPPORTING FAMILIES AND TRYING TO PAY BILLS. I DON'T HAVE THE LUXURY. OF SETTING ALL THAT ASIDE AND GOING TO A TRAINING PROGRAM SO WHAT WE NEED TO INVEST MORE IN AND THERE'S NOT ENOUGH OF THIS NOW- IN THE SUPPORT OF SERVICES THAT INCLUDE INCOME SUPPORTS FOR THOSE WORKERS SO THEY CAN STAY. IN TRAINING AND BENEFIT FROM THAT- AND GET ACCESS TO GOOD QUALITY JOB- IT ALSO OTHER KINDS OF SUPPORTS LIKE TRANSPORTATION HELP- CHILD CARE ASSISTANCE- HELP WITH TOOLS AND MATERIALS- AT. HOUSING ALL OF THOSE THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WE NEED TO REALLY INVEST IN BUT IN CONTEXT OF A QUALITY TRAINING THAT'S LEADING TO A GOOD QUALITY JOBS. THANKS THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER ANY FURTHER PRESENTATION IN REGARDS TO THE WORK FORCE OF OUR DEVELOPMENT YOU JUST MENTION IT COMES TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEVEL THE LOCAL LEVEL AND WE TRAIN THEM FOR THE JOBS THAT ARE THERE AND MY DISTRICT ITS AIRLINE MECHANICS AIRLINES AIRFRAME OF. REPAIRS AND WITH THE CONSTRUCTION PEOPLE OF THE STATE CONSTRUCTION THERE'S HUNDREDS OF JOBS IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY. THAT THEY ARE TRAINED FOR AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IF YOU CALL A PLUMBER IT'S TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET YOUR DRAIN CLEARED. BUT THEY WERE TRAINING THOSE PEOPLE FOR THOSE JOBS THAT ARE RIGHT THERE LOCALLY AND I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE FUNDING TO MAKE SURE YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES THAT YOU HAVE THERE. ANOTHER ONE IS A SOLAR ENERGY FIELDS AT UP THERE'S A BIG INDUSTRY RIGHT NOW. IS TRAINING THOSE FOR MAKING THE MANUFACTURING OF THE SOLAR PANELS AND MAINTENANCE OF THE SOLAR PANELS AND OF COURSE ELECTRIC ELECTRICITY GRID. THAT WOULD BE UPGRADED SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH LOOK FORWARD TO TRYING TO GET YOU ALL THIS. REVENUE AND RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED SO WE GET IT BACK TO THE COMMUNITY LEVEL. THANK YOU JOHN NUMBER. THANK YOU MISTER SMITH I DO I KNOW THAT WE HAVE ONLY A COUPLE MINUTES LEFT HERE AND I DO WANT TO MAYBE AND A WITH. SOME OF OUR COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES YOU KNOW WHAT ARE CALIFORNIA'S. GREATEST STRENGTH IN TERMS OF WORK FORCE IF YOU COULD DYE SHIRT US BE ADVISED. MR ANY. SUCH A GREAT QUESTION- MANY- WE HAVE OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES GREAT STE. CSU AND UC WE HAVE THE STRONGEST SYSTEM COMMITTEE COLLEGES I THINK INS IN THE COUNTRY- COMMITTEE COLLEGES SAVE MY LIFE- THEIR ACCESSIBLE- BUT TRAINING IS INEXPENSIVE. AND IT'S JUST A REALLY HIGH QUALITY SYSTEM WE HAVE REALLY STRONG LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARDS AROUND THE STATE. WHOSE ROLE IS SIMILAR TO OURS AT THE STATE LEVEL OF COORDINATING ALL THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AND CONNECTING THOSE TO WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN LABOR MARKETS WITH BUSINESSES- WE HAVE STRONG. PARTNERSHIPS WITH OUR MANUFACTURING ASSOCIATION BANK MANUFACTURING COMPANIES AROUND THE STATE WE HAVE REALLY STRONG PARTNERSHIPS WITH- THE TRADES TO THE STATE BUILDING TRADES COUNCIL THE LOCAL BUILDING TRADES COUNCILS- I MEAN THE STRENGTHS ARE MANIFOLD. AND OF COURSE CALIFORNIA'S INCREDIBLY DIVERSE ECONOMY. AND I THINK THAT'S A CHALLENGE ALSO BECAUSE WE HAVE TO BE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE A ONE SIZE FITS ALL ACROSS THE STATE THAT THE CHALLENGES IN FRESNO ARE VERY DIFFERENT THAN THE CHALLENGES. ARE IN SANTA CLARA SO- THAT DIVERSITY IS A GREAT STRENGTH. BUT IT'S ALSO- MAKE IT. REQUIRES OF TWO BILLS TO BE REALLY DELIBERATE THAT WE DON'T DRIVE EVERYTHING FROM SACRAMENTO BUT WE INVEST IN PARTNERSHIPS BETTER SECTOR BASIN THAT A REGIONAL. WONDERFULLY PART WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE YOUR TIME AND- YOUR PARTNERSHIP AS WE ARE LOOK AT HOW WE CAN CONTINUE INVESTING. AND IN GREAT QUALITY JOBS AS YOU STATED HI. THANK YOU FOR THIS SEGMENT OF OUR PANEL WE WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM.

IF YOU'RE WOMAN. WILL SERVE ON TAPE HELLO I'M TRACY STAND OFF AND PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE CELEBRATING OUR TWENTY SIX YEAR THIS THIS THIS TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE HERE- I HAVE TO SAY HELLO TO JAMES RAMOS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOUR TRIBE WAS THE FIRST TRIED TO JOIN OUR CHAMBER ARBOR REPRESENT THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE IN TRIBAL ENTERPRISES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AND WE ALSO RUN ON THE LARGEST AMERICAN INDIAN UP PROCUREMENT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER IN THE COUNTRY WE SERVE TWO HUNDRED SIX TRIBESMEN AGAIN THOUSANDS OF AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE. AND TRIBAL ENTERPRISES AND IT I AM A FORMER TRIBAL CHAIRWOMAN OF THE PRAIRIE BAND POTAWATOMI NATION AND CANCELS ALTHOUGH I'M A NATIVE OF CALIFORNIA. AND HAVE OWNED A BUSINESS YEAR FOR THIRTY THREE YEARS NOW WE DO ADVERTISE IN. THE GRAPHICS TOLD AT PRO. SO HAVE A VERY REAL PER OR WITH THIRTY. ARE OUR GOAL IS ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY THROUGH OUR PEOPLE THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE OWNERSHIP AND- WHERE WHERE WE'RE DOING IT WE'RE MAKING IT HAPPEN. WE ARE VERY FORTUNATE TO HAVE. JUST A GREAT- SLADE OF TRIBES AND PARTNERS THROUGHOUT CORPORATE AMERICA GOVERNMENT ENTITIES AND ART AND ART AND OUR MEMBERS WERE WERE RUN BY- AMERICAN INDIAN ALASKAN NATIVE OWNED BUSINESSES OR WHO ARE AT THE CORE OF OUR OUR- OUR GROUP AND- WE'RE- WE'RE AGAIN MAKING IT HAPPEN FOR PEOPLE. WE HAVE A LOT OF. OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR PUSHING FOR PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES WERE REALLY HOPING THE STATE CAN CONTINUE TO OPEN UP WITH. SAFELY WITH KOBE AND- PROTOCOLS THAT- ARE VERY NECESSARY WE'VE BEEN WORKING FOR THE LAST YEAR WE'VE DONE HUNDREDS OF WEBINARS AND BUSINESS CAPACITY BUILDING BUILDING INITIATIVES BUT WE NEED TO GET BACK IN PERSON WE NEED TO GET THE STATE ROLLING. AND WE NEED TO HELP OUR PEOPLE CONTINUE TO GROW AND- AGAIN ACHIEVE ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY THROUGH BUSINESS OWNERSHIP AND POORER PEOPLE AND OTHERS. HAVE HOLY DARSHAN INNER CHAMBER ALONE OVER FIFTY THOUSAND TO SIXTY THOUSAND PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO ARMED WORK WORSE. WERE SMALL MINORITY BUT WE'RE PRETTY DARN MY IDEAS AS THE WE'RE REALLY HAVING A GREAT TIME DOING THIS AND HELPING OUR PEOPLE SO THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY AND I APPRECIATE. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS FOR ME ALL THANK YOU SO MUCH OF A STAFF FOR BEING HERE THIS MORNING WITH US AND DIED SO CURRENT ENCOURAGING TO HEAR THEY WITH THE WORK THAT THE AMERICAN INDIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE IS DOING THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I LET ME GO AHEAD AND OPEN IT UP WITH THAT MAYBE A COUPLE QUESTIONS AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO. OUR COMMITTEE MEMBERS. ARE FOR ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. IF I MAY BE MY OUT FROM HIS WE COULD DO START THE YEAR HERE IS THE MOST SINGLE MOST IN. ACT THE STATE CAN'T. I TO. A SUCCESSFUL. RECOVERY AND IF YOU CAN ALSO WHILE WE'RE AT IT SHARE WHAT YOUR ORGANIZATION'S ECONOMIC RECOVERY PRIORITIES ARE FOR THIS YEAR. THE SINGLE MOST THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION BECAUSE THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT THE STATE CAN DO IS PROVIDE ACCESS TO CAPITAL. AND OF THE FORGIVABLE LOANS AND THE GRANTS ARE GREAT- WE HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF THEM BEING AWARDED TO OUR PEOPLE THOUGH UNFORTUNATELY AT TIMES- THE LATEST ROUND OF THE PPP LOAN I KNOW IT'S A FEDERAL PROGRAM. WITH THE 25% CRITERIA HAS REALLY LIMITED US TO ACCESS TO CAPITAL- SO THAT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT- THE STATE HAS BEEN CLOSED THERE'S REVENUE THERE THAT WE WILL NEVER EVER MAKE UP. SO PEOPLE TALK ABOUT LOANS AND OTHER THINGS WELL YOU HAVE TO HAVE BUSINESS TO GET LOANS OPPORTUNITY RUBBING ELBOWS CONTINUE TO BUILD THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT NEED TO BE BUILT TO BUILD- OPPORTUNITIES AND OPTION CONTRACTS IN THE WARD. FOR PEOPLE IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO US RIGHT NOW- WE'RE REALLY IN FOCUS ONCE WE GET OUT OF THIS WE HOPE ON A BY CALIFORNIA INITIATIVE. WHERE WE CAN ENCOURAGE- YOU FOLKS TO HELP US ENCOURAGE STATE AGENCIES AND COMPANIES TO CONTINUE THE BY CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE THE HIGHEST COST OF LIVING IN THE COUNTRY. AND WE HAVE THE HIGHEST UTILITY RATES IN THE COUNTRY AND- ARE YOU KNOW OUR SALARIES ARE. HIGH TOO SO WE TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVENESS- WE NEED TO FOCUS ON PUTTING THE MONEY BACK INTO OUR COMMUNITIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA WITH PHIL- SO THAT'S ONE OF THE MAJOR THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON. A GERMAN- THIS IS REALLY MAKING SURE THAT OUR PEOPLE- EQUIPPED TO DO BUSINESS AND CONTINUE TO DO BUSINESS BUT WE NEED TO GET BACK TO US AND WE NEED TO DO IT SAFELY SO ONE OF THE- GREATEST- ISSUES THAT WE'VE HAD IS PEOPLE NOT PREPARE ENOUGH FOLLOWING THE- COALBED. SAFETY PROTOCOLS AND- YOU KNOW MASKING UP CALVET AMERICAN INDIANS HAVE REALLY BEEN FIGHTING THIS DISEASE AND IT'S A VERY SAD WE HAVE THE ONE OF THE HIGHEST DEATH RATES AND INCIDENCE OF THE COVETED. INFECTION IN THE COUNTRY SO- BEEN REALLY. JUST MASS UP IN SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO HELP OUR PEOPLE. AND CONTINUE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR CALL. AND CAN TO OFFER BUSINESS IN THE BEST WAY WE CAN SEE FIT. TO MAINTAIN THROUGH THIS- AND IT'S BEEN TOUGH I WILL TELL YOU IT'S NOT EASY. FOR ANY OF US TO CONTINUE ON THIS PROCESS SO. ANYTHING YOU GUYS CAN DO TO HELP US- REBUILD AND TOUCH THROUGH WITH CAPITAL. ACCESS IS. REALLY APPRECIATED- AND THE STATE PROGRAM WERE PART OF THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS RELIEF BRANCH. THAT'S BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT I BELIEVE THERE'S JUST BEEN A LOW AMOUNT OF OUR PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO IT. TO GET GET THAT- THAT BACKGROUND AND I THINK L'INDUSTRIE STRONGER TREMENDOUS PROGRAM AND I CAN'T I CAN'T COMMIT IN THE MANAF- BUT THAT AL GORE AND WE'D LIKE TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THEY'RE LOOKING FOR THAT ALGORITHMS SO WE CAN HELP OUR PEOPLE. ANSWER THE QUESTIONS PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE STRATEGICALLY SO WE CAN- UP TO MORE OF THOSE GRANTS FOR FOLKS IN ROUNDS FIVE AND SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ONE NOTED. HI IF I COULD HAVE POSED THE SAME QUESTION TO MR MILLER JUST FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT IS THAT PROP SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT ACTION THAT THE STATE CONTAINS. THE STATE CAN TAKE ARE TO SUPPORT. THE SUCCESSFUL ECONOMIC RECOVERY. TO RESTORE MR MILLER ON. HELLO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES WE CAN OKAY WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL- BRING BACK THE ECONOMY WE'VE BEEN VERY LUCKY IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. TO US STAY RELATIVELY BUSY. DUE TO OUR TRAINING AND- ABILITY TO ADHERE TO THE PROTOCOLS THAT WERE PUT IN PLACE BY THE CDC. WE WERE ABLE TO KEEP A LOT OF CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS OPEN. OUR OUR MEN AND WOMEN ARE ABLE TO. USE THE PROPER PPD AND WORK ON THE PROJECTS RELATIVELY SAFELY. BUT WE'RE CONCERNED. WITH THE COMING OUT OF THIS IS NOT A DOWNTURN IN THE ECONOMY. THAT- WE GET THINGS GROWING OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE KIND OF HAVE BEEN PUT ON HIATUS BECAUSE THE CLASSROOM. YEAH THE ABILITY TO GET INTO A CLASSROOM. BOB WHAT WE SPEND TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR TRAINING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA APPRENTICES. WE'RE STARTED STICK OUR TOE BACK IN THE WATER GETTING APPRENTICESHIPS OPEN BACK UP. REALLY BEEN SORT OF ONLINE- BUT THE HANDS ON THAT'S REQUIRED IN THE CLASSROOMS HASN'T REALLY BEEN TAKEN PLACE SO IT'S GOING TO START. WHEN IT COMES TO. THE FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE IS WHERE IT'S AT. AND WHILE WE'RE UP ALL IN ON THE ELECTRIFICATION. AND THE GREENING OF THE NEW WORLD. WE CAN'T MAKE THE MISTAKES OF PAST PRACTICE AND LEAVE TECHNOLOGY AND INDUSTRY BEHIND LET'S THEIR IN PLACE ALREADY WE HAVE TO HELP IT ADAPT AND I'M TALKING ABOUT OIL AND GAS I'M TALKING ABOUT ENERGY. AND I'M TALKING ABOUT THE WATER YOU KNOW AS YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN A DESERT WATER IS VERY PRECIOUS TO US IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE HAVE TO HAVE. A MUTUAL FUND WATER CONVEYANCE ENERGY CONVEYANCE AND- ALSO WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CRISIS SO I WOULD ASK- THE IMPORTANT THING IS FOR POLICY MAKERS IN SACRAMENTO. WHEN YOU CREATE THE BILL'S ASK YOURSELF. HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO PROMOTE GOOD. A SKILLED AND TRAINED WORKFORCE. SO THAT WE CAN GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK. THANK YOU SO MUCH AYE MR MILLER LET ME TO QUICKLY TURN IT OVER- TO MISTER HASTINGS FOR THAT SAME QUESTION BUT IF YOU CAN ALSO. PERHAPS ANSWER FROM YOUR ORGANIZATION'S PERSPECTIVE WHAT HAVE BEEN THE THREE BIGGEST CHALLENGES. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY IS GONNA SOUND CLICHE- BUT THE BEST THING THAT THE STATE CAN DO AT THIS MOMENT IS TO GROW THE PIE. AND THAT IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE ECONOMY IS PUT ON A PATTERN OF GROWTH SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND AND MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY IS LISTED I VIDAK: BACK GROWING PART IN IT IT DOES SOUND CLICHE BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY HOW WE'RE GONNA COME OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC LET ALONE WENT- AND HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY OF HOPING THAT THERE'S THIS MIRACULOUS ECONOMIC ACTIVITY THAT SPENT TEN TOP IT JUST RELEASES ITSELF SO WHAT WE CAN DO. TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN ADMINISTRATION IS THAT YOU KNOW CAN INCREASE OUR LOSS AS IT WERE AND I'M GLAD THAT THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS MENTIONED INFRASTRUCTURE AND CAPITAL. BECAUSE THE MTA'S TOP LEGISLATIVE PRIORITY THIS SESSION IS ASSEMBLY BILL NINE OH FOUR WHICH WOULD PROVIDE AN INVESTMENT CREDIT FOR MANUFACTURING CAPITAL AND IT WOULD VARY AMONG THE SIZE OF MANUFACTURED SO WOULD ACTUALLY REWARD SMALLER MANY FACTS WITHIN A SLIGHTLY LARGER INCENTIVE THAN. THE LARGER MANUFACTURER AND HAVING THAT ON THE BOOKS IS A CLEAR SIGNAL FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT MANUFACTURERS AND IS A CRITICAL PART OF THE MONEY AND ONE THAT'S BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN LARGELY OPEN AS MR MILLER INDICATED- DURING THE LAST MONTH NOT EASILY I WILL TELL YOU BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REMAIN OPEN. A LOT OF OUR MEMBERS FALL WITHIN THE CRITICAL MANUFACTURING DESIGNATION AND THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP THEIR OPERATIONS GOING BUT IT IS ONLY WITH ADDITIONAL PP AT THE WORK SITE ADDITIONAL SEPARATION OF EMPLOYEES AND ADDITIONAL CHANGES IN OUR POLICIES AND PRACTICES THAT HAVE. MADE. THAT HAPPEN- BUT WE- IT AND WE BEEN SIX- ALONG THE WAY THOUGH TRAIN SEEMS BE A THEME THAT IS COMING THROUGH FROM ALL OF THE SPEAKERS. CURRENTLY THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL EXISTENCE READY MADE IT'S BEEN THERE FOR A LONG WHILE. AND OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IT HAS BEEN DECLINING IT IS RESOURCES BE MADE AVAILABLE. IF THERE IS A WAY THAT WE COULD PROP THAT UP TO ENSURE. THAT TRUCK THE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE IN FACT MORE FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE EACH YEAR. WOULD BE FANTASTIC- BECAUSE THE MORE SKILLED LABOR THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE IS GOING TO BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY. BOTH IN THE NEAR TERM BUT CERTAINLY IN THE IN THE LONG TERM- FOR THE THREE- IT'S I LOST ON THAT THE LAST SECTION MANAGER. I THINK YOU WANT TO FOCUS ON THE- THAT OUR THREE PRIORITIES. SO IF YOU COULD JUST MAYBE SHARE IT- SO THE THREE CHILD MAYBE CHALLENGES THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT HERE. AS AN ORGANIZATION. OKAY THE CHALLENGES IT IS AN UNKNOWN FUTURE- BUT WILL TURN THAT INTO AN OPPORTUNITY IF WE DO OUR JOBS CORRECTLY BY ENGAGING WITH THE LEGISLATURE- BUT I THINK AB I WANT TO GET THIS POINTED AT LEAST AT SOME POINT THIS MORNING AND THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK RIGHT NOW IS MORE DYNAMIC AND POLITICAL AND THAT IS THE BINARY NATURE OF. THE POLITICAL DISCOURSE IN THE IN THE COUNTRY AND IT IS EITHER A RIGHT OR WRONG YES OR NO- AT AT ASSEMBLY LEFT OR RIGHT WE NEED TO FIND A WAY TO HAVE A DISCOURSE WHERE WE CAN BRING ISSUES TO THE TABLE DISCUSS THEM AND FIND THE BEST PATHWAY FOR SUCCESS AND- ALL PLEDGE YOU KNOW OUR ENGAGEMENT ENACTED IN THAT DISCUSSION TO HOPEFULLY BE PART OF THE SOLUTION NOT PART OF THE PROBLEM. BUT IT'S JUST THAT THE SOCIAL DISCOURSE HAS BECOME SO- TO SIDE AND THAT I THINK WE'RE MISSING SOME OPPORTUNITIES AS A RESULT. THANK YOU SO MUCH IF I COULD TURN IT OVER TO MR ALMOST. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ONE FROM. RON- WITH THE BUILDING TRADES- WHEN YOU TALKING ABOUT THE CRITICISM THAT ARE GOING ON THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HOW WE SEE- SECTORS. THAT HAVE- CALLED ON A STRONGER DEMAND- DURING THIS TIME AND DO YOU SEE THAT DEMAND CARRYING FORWARD- INTO THE COMING YEAR. SO YES I'M NOT. WE'RE ANXIOUS TO GET UP FUTURE PROJECTS STARTED BUT WE SEE AND PRIVATE SECTOR MAYBE A SMALL SLOWDOWN WELL PUBLIC WORKS IS GONNA STILL GO VISITS THAT'S RELATED TO BONDS. SO IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE CONTINUE OUR EFFORT TRAINING BY THE EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANEL. BOB IT IS VERY IMPORTANT TO THE BUILDING TRADES ALSO. BECAUSE OUR EMPLOYERS ARE MADE UP OF EVERYTHING FROM A TWO TWO PERSON SHOP TO MALTA YOU KNOW FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED EMPLOYEES AND TRAINING IS- AND THAT HELPS THE EMPLOYERS THAT THAT TRAINING PANEL AND- THEN IT HASN'T BEEN FUNDED IN THE PAST. FEW YEARS CORRECTLY IT'S GONNA BE MORE IMPORTANT COMING OUT OF THIS- DOWNTURN MORE THAN EVER. MADAM CHAIR JUST FOLLOW UP ON AND SO TO THAT DO WE SEE THE APPRENTICE- PROGRAMS- UNION NONUNION APPROACH- HIGHLY INTO THE K. THROUGH. TWELVE FOR NOW. SO IN OUR AREA WE'RE WE'RE UP HEAVILY INVOLVED IN THE- WITH L. A. U. S. T. WITH OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WITH OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS. BOB THE- FORMALLY INCARCERATED PROGRAMS WE PARTNER WITH THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION- THE FLINT RIDGE CENTER THESE ALL DEAL WITH FORMERLY INCARCERATED TALKS. AND THEN- WE CAN'T FORGET ABOUT OUR VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL COMING OUT OF THE SERVICE. WE WANT TO FIND THOSE- FOLKS GOOD CAREERS IN THE CONSTRUCTION TRADES. AND I THINK THE FUTURE IS BRIGHT- EVERYBODY NEEDS TO SICKENING UPPER STRUCTURE SONG AND WORK TOGETHER ACROSS THE LINES. AND- WE HAVE THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN WASHINGTON NOW SO- INFRASTRUCTURE IS VERY IMPORTANT YUP ELECTRIC CARS AND THE GREEN CLIMATE ARE GREAT BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE ROADS TO PUT THOSE CARS ON OUR ROADS ARE IN DISMAL SHAPE SO THAT WOULD NOT TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WORK- FOR INFRASTRUCTURE. YOU TOO A LOT OF JOB CREATION IN THE FUTURE. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THAT'S NOT A QUESTION FOR- TRACY PRESIDENT OF THE AMERICAN INDIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WE'VE THE LEGISLATURE AND WORKING WITH THE MINISTRATION HAS APPROVED SO- BUSINESS RELATED- GRAPHS. IS GRATTON HOW TO APPLY FOR THOSE GRANTS- TRANSLATING OVER INTO THAT- INDIAN OWNED BUSINESSES HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YES ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF COMING IN VERY WELL FOR US- WE'RE PART OF THE TEAM THAT IS HELPING- PEOPLE APPLY FOR THE GRANTS- AGAIN EARLY CONCERN WAS WHAT ARE THEY LOOKING FOR ON THAT APPLICATION HOW DO IN BE MORE STRATEGIC AND MAKING SURE THAT OUR PEOPLE ARE BEING FOUND- SO IT'S BEEN A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE- WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE A QUERY OF OUR MEMBERS TO SEE HOW MANY HAVE GOTTEN- GRANT TO APPLY FOR THEM AND SO FAR IT ISN'T. REAL- DOESN'T LOOK GOOD BUT- APPARENTLY THE RESULTS OF ONE POINT 9% OF THE GRANTS WENT TO NATIVE AMERICANS BUT- WE DON'T KNOW YOU KNOW IF IT'S BEEN TRULY EFFECTIVE FOR US- BUT ASSEMBLY MEMBER ACCESS TO CAPITAL AND- THESE GRANTS ARE. VERY WELCOME- BECAUSE AS I SAID EARLIER WHEN WITH THE SHUT DOWN THE SLOWDOWNS WERE NEVER GOING TO MAKE THE REVENUE BACK NONE OF THE BUSINESSES ARE THAT WE'VE LOST IN THE LAST YEAR OR SO. AND INCOMES OUT OF THIS PANDEMIC WORK WE'RE STILL NOT THERE YET SO. OF MY PANELISTS AGREED SAYING THE TEACHERS ARE KNOWN A LITTLE BIT FOR US- BUT YOU KNOW WE'RE RESILIENT PEOPLE WALK WILL WILL KEEP PLUGGING ALONG THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I THANK YOU AND- THROUGH THE CHAIR IF THERE'S A WAY THAT WE COULD- HIGHLIGHT AND THROUGH THE COMMITTEE. AS FAR AS WHAT'S- ADDRESSED IN THOSE GRANTS AND HOW WE CAN GET SOME OUT REACH OUT THERE AS FAR AS FILLING OUT THOSE GRANTS TO MAKING SURE THAT- WE HAVE- PROMISE OF GETTING SOME OF THOSE GRANTS BACK INTO THE- INDIAN CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. WHETHER IT'S A SEMINAR WHETHER IT'S SOME SOME TAKE TYPE OF EDUCATIONAL- COMPONENT TO IT. WE DEEPLY FOR. IT THANK YOU CHAIR. YES MONITORED. MISTER OMINOUS. LET ME GO AHEAD AND TURN OVER TO MR SMITH. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GREAT PRESENTE A SMALL AS A RETIRED BUSINESS OWNER AND A PAST CONTRACTOR REALLY APPRECIATE THE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM. BUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO ON CALIFORNIA'S BESIDES HOUSING AND INFRASTRUCTURE BUT I'D LIKE TO ASK. MISTER HASTINGS AND MR MILLER. HOW IS SEEK WELL AFFECTED YOUR ORGANIZATION'S EXPECTING CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS I KNOW IT TAKES FOREVER TO BUILD ANOTHER LANE ON THE HIGHWAY. A REBUILD THE LANE ON THE HIGHWAY AND THEN I DO HAVE A FOLLOW UP FOR OFFICES STAND OFF WHEN WE'RE DONE. SO MAYBE MISTER HASTINGS CAN GO FIRST. IT IT YET THANK YOU- AND I'M GONNA HAVE ADDRESSED THE SITUATION BUT ALSO RAISE ANOTHER ONE IT'S THIS UNIQUE TO THE CURRENT CRISIS SO THE SECRET PROCESS HERE CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN USED TO DELAY PROJECTS OFTENTIMES WITHOUT ACTUALLY GETTING THAT ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT THAT WAS INTENDED WHEN THAT THE LAW WAS PASSED. AND WITH THAT DELAY COMES AT A COST IN BOTH IN THE FORMER PERMITTING AND APPROVALS BUT IT'S BEEN USED AS A TOOL TO DELAY RATHER THAN TO ENGAGE- TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S AN ENVIRONMENTAL. OF PROGRESS MADE ON OTHER PROJECTS- THE BIGGER CHALLENGE FIRST DURING A CRISIS IS BEEN IN OUR VIEW THE OSHA EMERGENCY STANDARDS THAT WERE ADOPTED NINE MONTHS INTO THE CRISIS AND HOW ARE IN FULL EFFECT AND HAVE BEEN A TREMENDOUS NEGATIVE. CONSEQUENCE FOR OUR FACILITIES THAT ARE OSHA COMPLAINT FROM THE GET GO AND HALF PP AS A MATTER OF COURSE IN OUR FUNCTIONS ARE YOU CAN'T WALK INTO A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IF YOU'VE RECENTLY TOURED ONE WITHOUT BE UNINVITED I PROTECTION YOUR PROTECTION AND SHE PROTECTION. FOR YOUR FOR YOUR FEET UP WE'VE NOW ADDED THE ELEMENT OF COURSE OF THE MASK- AND ALL OF OUR FACILITIES SO THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR WAS. EASIER TO TAKE UP THE ADDITIONAL PPE REQUIREMENTS BUT WHENEVER WE ADD A LAYER OF REGULATION THAT IS. CONSIDERED TO BE UNIQUE AND SPECIFIC TO THE CHALLENGE IT JUST ADDS TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF OUR WORK WITHOUT. EVERYONE TAKEN AS AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WE'RE CURRENTLY DOING I TENANTS IMAGE THIS CRISIS OR ANY FUTURE CRISIS SO THAT THE QUESTION REALLY AB WELL THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IS- BLESSES MORE AND I THINK IF THERE'S A MORE COOPERATIVE SPIRIT WHERE WE CAN SIT DOWN YEAR ON A PER PROJECT BASIS AND LOOK AT SEAQUEST. OR ON THE MACRO THE OSHA STANDARDS REALLY HAVE A REASONABLE DISCUSSION AND FIND OUT REALLY WHAT IS BEST FOR I EMPLOYERS WORKERS AND ULTIMATELY CALIFORNIA I THINK. WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO GO. THANK YOU. AND MR MILLER. WELL STE STE SMOKING UP UNDER THAT YES WAS IS ISSUE IN STATE GETS STUCK BUILT. OUR GOAL IS ALL TO- MAKE SURE THE PHONE THAT WORK ON THESE. WELL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE BUILDING THE AFFORDABLE HOUSING CAN AFFORD TO LIVE IN ONE OF UNITS. AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- EVERYBODY HAS GOOD WAGES. SAFETY ON THE PROJECT HEALTHCARE AND A MODEST PENSION AT THE AGE OF THIRTY YEARS OF A CAREER. AND THAT'S NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK EVERYBODY SHOULD ONLY HAVE TO HAVE ONE JOB. I'VE GOT FORTY TWO YEARS IN THE PLUMBING TRADE. AND IT'S AN ATRADIUS BANNED VERY GOOD TO ME. IT'S NOT WHATEVER YOU PUT INTO IT YOU'LL GET OUT OF IT. BUT I WAS ABLE TO RAISE MY FAMILY PUT MY KIDS THROUGH SCHOOL. AND WE GOT A LOT OF THOUGHT BUILT. AND EVERYBODY SHOULD HAVE THAT SAME OPPORTUNITY IN CALIFORNIA I THINK OUR TRAINING PROGRAMS- HELPED SHAPE THEM INDIVIDUALS SO THAT THAT THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO IT- BUT IT DOES TAKE TOO LONG TO BUILD STUFF IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO STREAMLINE THE PROCESS BUT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S GOOD LABOR STANDARDS ATTACHED TO ALL OF THOSE- POLICIES THANK YOU MR MILLER THE OLD ADAGE IN CONSTRUCTION AS YOU'RE DRIVING DOWN THE HIGHWAY YOUR FAMILY GETS TIRED TO SAY AND I BUILT THIS AND I BUILT THAT BUT MOVING ON TO US MRS OF STAND OFF WITH IT JUST LIKE TO SEE IF YOU COME UP ON THE SCREEN FIRST. HELLO OKAY THERE WE GO WHAT DID YOU MENTIONED THE BIGGEST PROBLEM IS CAPITAL I'D LIKE TO WORK WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE THE RESOURCES AND INFORMATION TO GET IT OUT TO YOUR MEMBERS IN THE CHAMBERS SO THEY KNOW WHERE IT IS SO THEY CAN APPLY FOR IT AND IF THEY NEED HELP APPLYING FOR THAT THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS FOR THEM. I APPRECIATE THAT SIR. WE DON'T WE ARE PART OF THE TEAM AND WE'VE BEEN DOING- THOUSANDS OF CALLS HELPING PEOPLE. I THINK THE CONCERN THAT WE HAVE IS WHAT IS THE CRITERIA ACTUALLY FOR GETTING THIS RECORD. I THINK OF THE FIRST LINE THEY HAD- FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY FIVE REPORTED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF GRANTS GO OUT. WHICH IF YOU LOOK AT IT JUST AS AVERAGE OR WHAT THE GRANT WOULD BE. FORTY TO FIFTY THOUSAND BUSINESSES OUT OF FOUR MILLION NUMBER CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESSES WOULD GET. SOME TYPE OF GRANT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERN FOR US- WE JUST NEED TO KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE SECRET SAUCE BASICALLY FORGETTING GRANT. AND HOW DO WE POSITION OUR BUSINESSES FOR REALLY- GETTING THAT ALGORITHM THAT SELECTING THESE BUSINESSES RANDOMLY- SUPPOSEDLY TO- THEIR ATTENTION. SO THANK YOU FOR COMPUTER CONCERN AND- IT'S. IT'S A CHALLENGE SO I WILL SAY THAT. WE WILL WORK HARD FOR YOU THANK YOU BECAUSE AS WE ALL SAY WE'RE TALKING LOW INCOME DIVERSITY PEOPLE OF COLOR YOU ARE IN ALL OF THOSE CATEGORIES SO YOU SHOULD BE RISING TO THE TOP OF THE LEVEL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TRANSCRIBING TURNER'S THANK YOU I THANK YOU ALL FOR AT FOR BEING HERE AND SHARING YOUR PERSPECTIVE THIS IS BEEN A- REALLY REALLY GOOD HEARING THANK YOU CHAIR. I'M SO I WANT TO COME BACK TO THE CONVERSATION AROUND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND- RETRAINING I KNOW THAT THAT SEEM TA AND THE BUILDING TRADES ARE REALLY KEY PARTNERS OF CALIFORNIA'S WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. BOTH OF YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR SOME OF YOUR REMARKS. A NEED FOR US TO INVEST MORE IN I'D IN EMPLOYMENT TRAINING PANELS. ARE THERE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE US DOING TO ACCELERATE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ACROSS THE STATE PARTICULARLY AT THIS INCREDIBLY CRITICAL JUNCTURE. YEAH ABSOLUTELY LET ME GO FIRST MR MILLER. AND I WOULD ACTUALLY WE HAD SECRETARY ACTUALLY SUED OUT OF THE INTECH CENTER. I WHICH IS A PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP WITH CALIFORNIA STEEL HAT COLLEGE AND AS A MODEL- HAVING THAT TYPE OF PROGRAM AND- OFFERED AROUND THE STATE WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. RIGHT NOW IT'S NOT NECESSARILY REPLICABLE THAT THE NEEDS FOR TRAINING IN THE SOUTH PLANMAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE NEEDS AND NORTHERN CALIFORNIA BUT TO IDENTIFY WITH THOSE NEEDS ARE AND DEVELOP A PUBLIC PRIVATE. PARTNERSHIP WOULD BE A GREAT WAY TO GO BECAUSE IT RESIDES YOU KNOW NOT FULLY WITHIN THE GOVERNMENT BUT NOT FULLY WITHOUT AND IT'S A PARTNERSHIP IN ONE THAT IS PROVEN SUCCESS. AND OUR MEMBER CALIFORNIA STEEL INDUSTRIES AS A BIG BENEFACTOR THAT BECAUSE THEY DONATED LAND ADJACENT TO THEIR FACILITY. SO IF WE COULD FIND OTHER PLACES TO REPLICATE THAT MODEL TO SIT ALONGSIDE ETP AND OTHER TRAINING PROGRAMS PARTICULARLY THE LOCAL LEVEL- THAT WOULD BE A HUGE STEP FORWARD CMT IS COMMITTED. TO MAKING THOSE PROGRAMS HAPPEN- AS BEST WE CAN BECAUSE THE NEEDS ARE LOCAL IT'S YOU KNOW THE OLD CLICHE ALL POLITICS IS LOCAL ALL TRAINING IS LOCAL TO. AND THE NEEDS OF THE DIFFERENT AROUND THE STATE BUT ONCE WE IDENTIFY WHAT THOSE ARE IN THE VARIOUS REGIONS I THINK WE'RE OFF TO THE RACES OF AND WE'RE REALLY HAVING AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRAIN. AS MANY CALIFORNIANS. SUPPORT FOR SOME JOBS. CAN MR MILLER. YEP I KNOW IT GOING TO GET OF HEARING ABOUT IT BUT INFRASTRUCTURE IS THE KEY AND- UP. THE GREEN THE GREEN NEW DEAL IN THE STATE. WE'RE ALL ABOUT THAT WE'RE WE'RE THE FOLKS IN THE BUILDING TRADES THAT ARE BUILDING. THE SOLAR FACILITIES OUT IN THE DOCTOR'S. THE WINDMILLS UP ON THE MOUNTAINS. UP WERE ALSO THE THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS THAT WORK IN THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY. AND DESPITE WHAT FOLKS SAY THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY IS NOT GOING ANYWHERE FOR QUITE A FEW YEARS. WE'RE ALL WORKING HARD TO DEVELOP THAT ALTERNATIVE ENERGY SO THAT ONE DAY THAT HAPPENS. BUT WE CAN'T LEAVE BEHIND INDUSTRIES LIKE WE HAVE IN THE PAST. MY DAD WORKED FOR GENERAL MOTORS FOR THIRTY YEARS AND NOW I WORK WITH POLITICIANS IN THE CITY OF SOUTH GATE THAT DON'T EVEN KNOW GENERAL MOTORS CAR PLAN EVER EXISTED. WE'VE HAD SO MUCH MANUFACTURING BELIEVES. BECAUSE THE INDUSTRY IS NOT HERE LIKE IT USED TO BE WE HAVE TO WORK HARD. YEAH RETAKING THE INDUSTRY HELPING THEM- CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS MODEL IF SO BE IT SO THAT THEIR CLEANER. AND IT HERE TO- ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS BUT WE HAVE TO DO IT IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO WORK WE DON'T RUN HIM OUT OF THE STATE. BECAUSE ALL OF THOSE INDUSTRIES THAT LEFT THAT ARE NOT HERE ANYMORE WE CAN GO OUT OF BUSINESS THEY LEFT AND WENT TO ANOTHER STATE. SO WE HAVE TO. I JUST ASK YOU TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. WHEN YOU'RE UPLOADING LEGISLATION TOGETHER. AND JUST JUST ASK YOURSELF WHAT IT IS A GONNA DO TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY INTO THE LOCAL WORKFORCE WE WANT TO TRAIN EACH AND EVERY PERSON THAT WANTS TO GO TO WORK IN CONSTRUCTION. BUT WE HAVE TO HAVE CONSTRUCTION JOBS BEFORE THE MODEL THE END OF THE DAY WE HAVE TO HAVE THAT WAY. TO A CAREER. EXCELLENT THANKS FOR THAT AND I THINK WHAT WHAT I HEAR YOU SAYING AND- I SPACE CERTAINLY AGREE IS. AS WE ARE WORKING TO ACHIEVE A CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE GOALS THERE'S A TON OF OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CREATE GREAT JOBS IN CLEAN ENERGY AND GREEN INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN OVERNIGHT AND SO WE'VE GOT TO MANAGE. THAT SAID THAT TRANSITION AND WE'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE CREATING THAT PIPELINE OF GOOD JOBS. AS THESE NEW INDUSTRIES ARE EMERGING. SEPT I THINK IT'S A SECOND EXCITING OPPORTUNITY THANK. SERVICING INTERNATIONAL QUESTIONS FROM ANY OF THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH PUBLIC TESTIMONY AT THIS TIME I WANT TO THANK EACH OF OUR SPEAKERS.

AND ONE OF THE LARGEST EITHER CALIFORNIA STATE MALL BUSINESS CREDIT INITIATIVES AT THE CCI PROGRAM FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION WE KNOW FIRST HAND HOW TRANSFORMATIVE THE FEDERAL FUND CAN BE TO ENSURE CDFI OTHER LENDERS PROVIDE CAPITAL TO SMALL BUSINESSES OWNED BY PEOPLE OF COLOR WOMEN. AND OTHER UNDER INVESTED POPULATION. THAT COULD SECOND AND SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SIZEABLE ROUND OF SSEC I FUNDING THROUGH THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN HAS THE POTENTIAL TO DRAMATICALLY INCREASE ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR UNDER ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS AHEAD. HE GATHER WE CAN REPLICATE AND BUILD ON CALIFORNIA'S SUCCESSES AS ONE OF THE STATE WITH THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF AFFECT BCI FUNDING GOING TO BUSINESSES AND LOW AND MODERATE INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS FOLLOWING THE GREAT RECESSION.

THAT THESE VERY SMALL WOMEN OWNED BUSINESSES ARE TRULY CIRCULATING THEIR REVENUES MORE THAN TWO TIMES IN LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SO WHEN YOU ARE THINKING OF ECONOMIC INCLUSION AND ECONOMIC IN OUR STATE'S RECOVERY AND IN YOUR DISTRICT PLEASE BE THINKING ABOUT WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS I'D ALSO LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT THE JEDI COMMITTEE HAVE A SPECIAL HEARING SPECIFICALLY ONE BRIEFING SPECIFICALLY ON WOMEN- AND- DELVED INTO SOME OF THE NUMBERS AND DATA THAT WE'VE DEVELOPED HERE AT THE- W. DC NETWORK. THANK YOU. NINE FOURTEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER CERVANTES AND MEMBERS OF THE JEDI COMMITTEE THIS IS NANCY THOUGHT SO- I AM FOLLOWING QUALITY OF THE I'M SUBMITTING THIS TESTIMONY AS CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA WOMEN'S BUSINESS CENTER NETWORK. AS CLAUDIA MENTIONS WERE SIXTEEN CENTERS IN TWENTY ONE LOCATIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE FOURTEEN OF THESE CENTERS RECEIVE STATE FUNDING THROUGH THE GOBIZ TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION PROJECT. IF YOU WANT AN INCLUSIVE ECONOMY TO EMERGE FROM BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL RELIEF EFFORTS AND CERTAINLY IN CONSIDERING- TRANSFORMING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS WE MUST TARGET WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS THERE ALMOST TWO MILLION ON WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS IN CALIFORNIA SO THAT'S ROUGHLY HALF MOST ARE VERY SMALL SELF EMPLOYED BRINGING CRITICAL HOUSEHOLD INCOME. A MAJORITY OF WOMEN OF COLOR FOR THE PAST YEAR THE COVERT INDUSTRY SESSION HAS BEEN AND SHE FASHION WOMEN LOST JOBS AT A HIGHER RATE THAN MEN BECAUSE THEY WILL WORK IN CUSTOMER FACING SECTORS OF THE SERVICE ECONOMY LIKE RESTAURANTS RETAIL EDUCATION HEALTHCARE THEY WERE HIT FIRST AND HARDEST. BLACK AND LYFT NEXT WOMEN WERE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED THIS JOB LOSSES ALSO IMPACTED SELF EMPLOYED WOMEN THOSE OPERATING MICRO AND SMALL IN UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES BOTH. URBAN AND RURAL AND URBAN. W. OF UP AND DOUBLE THE TO EARTH STRUGGLE WOMEN AND TO STABILIZE INSIST BUSINESSES HELP THEM GET THE CAPITAL THAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING TODAY. DAVID THEIR BUSINESSES TO ACCESS NEW MARKETS AND CREATED DIGITAL PRESENCE. WE'VE ALSO SEEN AN UPTICK IN DEMAND FOR HELP IN STARTING A NEW BUSINESS. WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS NEED TO GENERATE HOUSEHOLD INCOME WHILE ASSUMING THE FAMILY CARE GIVING ROLES AS THEY RUN THEIR BUSINESS. DEMAND FOR BUSINESS SUPPORT SERVICES ALSO KNOWN AS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IS BASED AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL AND HAS EXPECT X. EXPONENTIALLY INCREASED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WITH THE CALIFORNIA RELIEF GRANT PROGRAMS THEY RENEWED PPP LOANS TARGETING THE SELF EMPLOYED. NOW WE'RE SEEING A SURGE OF APPLICATIONS FROM STE FOR MORE P. YOU A BENEFITS FOR THE SELF EMPLOYED. I HAVE SUBMITTED THE FULL TESTIMONY SO I THINK I TO SHORTEN THIS BY SAYING- WE'RE ASKING THAT- THE STATE LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE THE EXTENSION OR PERHAPS CODIFIED THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE EXPANSION GRANT PROGRAM. WE ALSO URGE YOU TO EXPAND FUNDING NOW TO RESPOND TO THE INCREASED DEMAND. OF THE CARES ACT INCREASED OUR BUDGETS BY ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS LAST YEAR BUT THIS FUNDING ONE WIND DOWN IT'LL TAKE LONGER THAN THAT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY HEART HARDEST HIT COMMUNITIES TO FULLY RECOVER. SO AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING AND AS WE CONSIDER- OPTIONS FOR A REPOSITIONING THE EFFORTS TO SUPPORT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT HE MUST CONSIDER WOMEN ENTREPRENEURS. IN THIS MIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
