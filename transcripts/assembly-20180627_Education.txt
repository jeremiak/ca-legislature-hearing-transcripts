TO SP TWO TWO SEVEN AS ARE THROUGH TWO SEVEN THANK YOU MUCH -- MISTER CHAIR HAVE MISTER VICE CHAIR -- KILEY AND MISSILE WEBER FROM SAN DIEGO SWELLED MISTER CALDERON FOOT ALTITUDE TO PRESENT US IN THE BUILT A TWO TWO SEVEN A AS YOU KNOW -- MISS ADJOURNMENTS VICE CHAIR LAST YEAR ALL WASHINGTON RUSH TO PASS. HE GROSSLY IRRESPONSIBLE TAX PLAN TO GIVE THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS AND CORPORATIONS A MORE THAN ONE TRILLION DOLLAR TAX CUT. AT OUR EXPENSE. THIS REPUBLICAN TAX SCANDAL LIBERALLY TARGETS AMERICANS IN BLUE STATES QUITE FRANKLY. THOSE STATES HAVE VOTED OVERWHELMINGLY AGAINST A DONALD TRUMP IN THE COULD CAUSE CALIFORNIANS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IN FACT THE AVERAGE CAL FOR TAXPAYER NAY SAY AVERAGE TAX FOR CLASS THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM DEMOCRAT OR REPUBLICAN -- WHAT IT WOULD FOR TRUMP OR YOU SANDERS OR DELUDE CLINTON? THE AVERAGE TAX DEDUCTION USING THIS EXEMPTION SALT STATE AND LOCAL TAX IS ROUGHLY AT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. A YEAR. NOW THAT DEDUCTION HAS BEEN CAPPED TO TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS MEANING ALMOST THREE MILLION SPECIFICALLY. THREE MILLION CALIFORNIANS WILL LOSE OUT ON THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AVAILABLE DEDUCTIONS EACH YEAR ON THEIR FEDERAL TAXES. SENATE BILL TWO TWO SEVEN IS DESIGNED TO ENSURE CALTRANS WOULD HAVE TO FOOT THE BILL. FOR THIS RIDICULOUS TAX GIVEAWAY BY GIVING THEM A CHARVEL OUTLET THAT WILL HELP THEM WHILE HELPING OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. SO BILL TO DO SOME WOULD ALSO CREATE A FUND THAT TAXPAYERS CAN CREEP SHOOT CAN CONTRIBUTE TO WE SHOULD GIVE THEM AN 85% TAX CREDIT ON EVERY DOLLAR THEY COULD YOU IT. IT'S VERY SO MUCH MY MEASURE DEALING WITH CAL GRANTS WHICH I BELIEVE ONE OF YOUR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS NOW WANTS TO ACTUALLY EXTEND THAT TELL A CAL GRANT EXTENSION WITH AT FIFTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR. WHICH IS A LOT OF CALIFORNIA. THEN RELYING ON LONG STANDING FEDERAL CHERNOBYL CONTRIBUTION RULE THE TAXPAYER CAN DEDUCT. THE AMOUNT LISTED ON THEIR CERTIFICATION FROM THE FEDERAL TAXES EXACTLY AS IT WOULD UNDER STATE AND LOCAL TAX DEDUCTION. THAT THE REPUBLICANS CAPPED IN WASHINGTON DC. WE ALSO HAVE A COMPANION CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT OF ITS CHARMS VICE CHAIR OF SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT. TWENTY THREE WHICH PROTECTS ALL OF OUR EDUCATION FUNDING FORMULAS MAKING SURE WE MEET ALL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BEFORE ADMINISTERING THIS CREDIT. ALL IT WOULD BE AT THE STATE AND ITS TAXPAYERS IF WE OFFERED A MENU OF CHERNOBYL OPTIONS SO THEY CAN CHOOSE HOW THEY WANT TO PUT THEIR CHORTLE GIVING TO WORK. TAKEN TOGETHER THIS MEASURE ALONG WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN'S BARRACKS A MEASURE. TWO TWO SEVEN THE VAST MAJORITY I THINK OF EVERY MEMBER I SHOULD VOTE FOR FUN SET FOR YOU THE ILLUSTRIOUS VICE CHAIR OF THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE -- WHAT'S AB -- TWO TWO SEVEN ALONG WITH THAT MOVE IS ANOTHER MEASURE COMING WE'LL OFFER CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS THAT MENU OF OPTIONS HELPING THEM. GIVE TO THE CAUSE OF THEIR CHOICE WITH SHARP I WANT TO BEGIN BY OFFER TO TAKE AN AMENDMENT. TO MAKE -- TWO TWO SEVEN SHOULD SAY SENATE BILL TWO TWO SEVEN CONTINGENT. ON THE VOTERS APPROVAL OF SENATE CONSTITUTIONAL -- AMENDMENT NUMBER TWENTY THREE THAT WAY WE CAN HAVE A CONSTITUTIONALLY BE A GUARANTEE THAT WE PROTECT OUR FUNDING FORMULAS AND HOLD. UP PROP NINETY EIGHT ARE HARMLESS BY DOING SO WE LOVE THE TAXPAYERS OF CALIFORNIA TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE BETTERMENT OF OUR STATE. HOPING CALIFORNIA WHILE THEY HELP THEMSELVES THIS MEASURE WOULD PROTECT OVER THREE MILLION CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS AND CAN ONLY ONLY LET ME UNDERSCORE ONLY BENEFIT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THEREFORE I RECENTLY ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU MANY OTHERS IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL [inaudible] ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR COMMITTEE MEMBERS JENNIFER BAKER WITH THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE IN A POLL OPPOSED TO SPT TWENTY SEVEN AS WELL AS THE COMPANION AS HE TWENTY THREE FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS HIM WHILE WE CERTAINLY DON'T SUPPORT THE RECENT CHANGES TO THE FEDERAL SALT TAXES -- WE UNFORTUNATELY DO NOT SUPPORT THESE MEASURES MOVING FORWARD AS WE DO BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON PROP NINETY EIGHT FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS ALTHOUGH I HAVE TO SAY NOW THAT THE THIS IS GONNA BE CONJOINED WITH THEIR CA. TWENTY SO HOW WE DO APPRECIATE THAT BUT S. B. TWO TWENTY SEVEN DOES NOT RECONCILE THE TAX YEAR BASIS WOULD PROP NINETY EIGHT FISCAL YEAR BASIS. IT ALSO FEELS TO INCLUDE THE BASELINE SUPPLEMENT -- SUB ACCOUNT INTO THE ACTUAL MAINTENANCE FACTOR ITSELF IT ALSO DOESN'T PROVIDE -- FOR WHAT HAPPENS IN THE EVENT THAT THE IRS SAYS THAT -- THEY ARE NOT GOING TO ACCEPTANCE OUT WHAT HAPPENS TO THE FUNDS THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PAID HOW ARE THEY GOING TO BE REALLOCATED HOW'S THAT GOING TO IMPACT PROP NINETY IN EDUCATIONAL FUNDING. ADDITIONALLY IT DOESN'T CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED SCHOOLS RIGHT TO SUPPLEMENTAL SUB ACCOUNT FUNDS SO WE ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS COULD HINDER MANY OF THE PROTECTIONS THAT WERE ESTABLISHED IN PROP NINETY IN FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POSTED THE MEASURE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. SEEN ON THEIR OPPOSITION OVER YOU BEHIND THE THE THE REAL HERE OB I JUST WANTED YOU AYE I DO ONE OF THANK THE AUTHOR FOR POINTING OUT THAT CALIFORNIANS BY AND LARGE GOING TO TAX INCREASE. WITH WHAT SOME CALLED A TAX CUT. RICE THAT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE IN FACT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HEADLINES WEATHER HEADLINES THE FRONT PAGE LA TIMES TODAY -- THERE'S A LOT OF PEOPLE INSIDE WASHINGTON THAT ARE VERY CONCERNED WITH THE RAPID DEBT. THEY THEY THEY DEBT THAT IS GOING RAPIDLY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE OF THIS TAX CUT FOR SOME THE TAX INCREASE FOR OTHERS. SO I THINK THE WHOLE PLAN.

FOR WHY WOULD SAY WOULD YOU NEED HE'S NOT A 3% ARE NOT A 4% IF YOU'RE GOING INTO DEBT TO DO THAT THAT'S JUST A CREDIT CARD. SO AWASH IN A SCENE REALLY NEEDS TO GET OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER.

A DOES INCLUDE FORTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS -- ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR VISUAL AND PERFORMING ARTS EDUCATION IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET -- S. B. NINE THIRTY THREE IS THE VISION FOR THAT FUNDING ON THIS GIVE SCHOOL THE NEED TO JUMP START IN VISUAL PERFORMING ARTS THAT IS NEEDED. THE CALIFORNIA EDUCATION CODE DOES REQUIRE THAT ALL K. TWELVE STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE VISUAL ON PERFORMING ARTS INSTRUCTION HOWEVER YET THAT THE VISUAL AND PERFORMING ARTS DATA PROJECT CONCLUDES ABOUT ONLY 39%. OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS PARTICIPATE ME ARE OUR EMERALD PARTS OF THE STATE IN SOME OF OUR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES.

NICK LEON BALFE THEY SELL YOUR CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. BRIAN HOW WITH CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS WERE IN SUPPORT. THINK YOU'RE MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. AYE WELL I MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT -- YOU TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY -- AYE I'M A BELIEVER IN THE POWER OF OF ARTS EDUCATION AND I AND I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE ABOUT AYE WELL. HOW WORD OF CAUTION THAT THIS SEEMS TO BE -- ANOTHER CATEGORICAL PROGRAM WILL CREAING THAT IS SOMEWHAT AT ODDS I WITH THE SPIRIT OF LCF BATH AND SO I THINK WE NEED DE THINK A LITTLE YOU KNOW MORE BROADLY ABOUT -- IF THIS IS GOING TO BE A PRIORITY ARTS EDUCATION WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO ACTUALLY PROMOTE THAT ONE ALTERNATIVE FOR EXAMPLE MIGHT BE GIVING. LOCAL LAW SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- MORE FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS ABOUT WHAT THEIR OFFERINGS ARE SO IF YOU LIVE WITHIN A DISTRICT MIGHT BE ONE SCHOOL THAT DOES A LOT WITH ARTS EDUCATION AND YOU KNOW THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT AND IF THAT'S NOT IMPORTANT YOU CAN GO TO ANOTHER SCHOOL SO I AM. I VERY MUCH -- YOU KNOW I AND AS WE REVISIT THIS -- ISSUE IN FUTURE YEARS OUT WE SHOULD. THINK HARD ABOUT WHAT THE RIGHT APPROACHES -- BUT TACK WE DO HAVE A MOTION THERE. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND TO THE MOTION IS TO PASSED AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS UP WITH CULTURAL THAT I'M JUST GOING TO STIR AND OBJECT CLOSE AT THE CLOSE A JUST JUST JUST. JUST IN RESPONSE TO A COUPLE OF YOUR COMMENTS A MISTER VICE CHAIR MISTER CHAIR RIGHT NOW -- I U. S. -- YOU YOU YOU YOU OBSERVE THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME DISTRICTS DON'T HAVE. A DIFFERENT ART PROGRAMS AT SOME OTHER SCHOOLS I CAN TELL YOU THAT I'M LONG BEACH WE DO WE HAVE A MEDIA ARTS SCHOOL -- IT'S VERY COMPUTER BASED AND THEN WE HAVE OF THE RENAISSANCE HIGH SCHOOL WHICH IS MORE. THE I GUESS VISUAL ARTS SPACE SO THERE ARE DISTRICTS THAT ARE DEVELOPING THESE PROGRAMS ACROSS THE STATE I DON'T THINK WE WANT TO MANDATE. THAT TO OCCUR FROM SACRAMENTO IS WE DON'T KNOW THE NEEDS OF EVERY LOCAL DISTRICT AND TO YOUR POINT ABOUT CREATING ANOTHER CANNIBAL CORPORAL PROGRAM I DON'T THINK THIS DOES THAT I THINK WHAT THIS DOES IS IT INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR. AND WHAT I FOUND -- DURING MY TIME IN SACRAMENTO IS BETTER THAT WE INCENTIVIZE BEHAVIOR. THEN WE MANDATE BEHAVIORS AND YOU GET MORE SIDE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU INCENTIVIZE IT'S DIFFERENT TYPES OF BEHAVIOR AND AGAIN I THINK THE INTENT HERE IS TO CREATE THAT CAPACITY. AT THE DISTRICT AND SCHOOL SITE LEVEL -- TO TO IT TOO TO CREATE BETTER ARTS PROGRAMS AND ALSO THAT IT THAT IT CAPACITY IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND THEN A YOU KNOW AS WE MOVE DOWN THE TIMELINE WE CAN YOU KNOW MAYBE LOOK AT HOW ELSE CFF CAN TAKE CARE FOR THOSE EFFORTS AS WELL.
