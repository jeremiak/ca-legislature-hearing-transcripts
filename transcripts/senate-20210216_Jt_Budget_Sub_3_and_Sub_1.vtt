MAYBE I SHOULD START WITH THE

BUDGET YEAR. COULD YOU EXPLAIN-

00:19:56.228 --> 00:19:59.932
WHY THAT'S THE RECOMMENDATION.

00:19:59.998 --> 00:20:01.199
MORNINGS A SERVER NOW WITH THE

00:20:01.266 --> 00:20:02.534
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ALL GO

AHEAD AND START WITH SOME

00:20:03.869 --> 00:20:05.137
COMMENTS ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENING

00:20:05.203 --> 00:20:06.171
IN THE STAGE CHIU CHILD CARE

00:20:06.238 --> 00:20:08.273
PROGRAM- BUT NAMELY WHAT WE DO

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:10.142
HERE AT FINANCES THAT WE TRACK

00:20:10.208 --> 00:20:11.710
THOSE NUMBERS ARE SIMILARLY TO

00:20:11.777 --> 00:20:12.678
WHAT OUR COLLEAGUES AT THE L.

00:20:12.744 --> 00:20:14.479
A. OWNS PART OF EDUCATION DO AS

00:20:14.546 --> 00:20:17.082
WELL- AND WE ADJUST THE BUDGET

00:20:17.149 --> 00:20:19.217
CORRESPONDINGLY TO WHAT WE SEE

00:20:19.284 --> 00:20:20.886
HAPPENING TO THE CASELOAD IN

00:20:20.953 --> 00:20:22.321
THE COST PER CASE FOR CHILD

00:20:22.387 --> 00:20:23.755
CARE AND BOTH THE STAGE TWO AND

00:20:23.822 --> 00:20:26.592
STAGE THREE PROGRAM. SO A TREND

00:20:26.658 --> 00:20:27.526
THAT WE HAVE BEEN NOTICING FOR

00:20:27.593 --> 00:20:29.628
AT LEAST THE LAST YEAR OR TWO

00:20:29.695 --> 00:20:31.296
IS THAT THE CASE WILL NUMBER IN

00:20:31.363 --> 00:20:32.965
STAGE TWO HAS BEEN GOING DOWN

00:20:33.031 --> 00:20:34.466
IT'S BEEN DECREASING AND THERE

00:20:34.533 --> 00:20:35.934
ARE CERTAIN POLICY IMPLICATIONS

00:20:36.001 --> 00:20:38.170
THAT BECAUSE THAT ON THAT OUR

00:20:38.236 --> 00:20:39.738
DEPARTMENTAL COLLEAGUES MIGHT

00:20:39.805 --> 00:20:41.773
HAVE A BETTER INSIGHT INTO- BUT

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.109
WE SIMPLY ADJUSTS THE BUDGET

00:20:44.176 --> 00:20:45.177
ALLOCATIONS BASED OFF THOSE

00:20:45.243 --> 00:20:47.079
NUMBERS A STAGE TO HAVE BEEN

00:20:47.145 --> 00:20:48.580
DECREASING STAGE THREE HAS

00:20:48.647 --> 00:20:49.881
ACTUALLY BEEN INCREASING-

00:20:49.948 --> 00:20:51.917
CASELOAD WISE AT LEAST- IN SORT

00:20:51.984 --> 00:20:54.119
OF EQUAL AMOUNTS SO IN THE

00:20:54.186 --> 00:20:56.655
BUDGET YEAR- THE RECOMMENDATION

00:20:56.722 --> 00:20:57.522
AND THE PROPOSAL THAT WE'RE

00:20:57.589 --> 00:20:59.024
PUTTING FORWARD IS TO DECREASE

00:20:59.091 --> 00:21:00.826
STAGE TWO BY THE TRENDS THAT

00:21:00.892 --> 00:21:02.060
WE'RE SEEING AN INCREASE STAGE

00:21:02.127 --> 00:21:04.296
THREE. BY A SIMILAR AMOUNT IT'S

00:21:04.363 --> 00:21:05.998
ALMOST AND THAT- ZERO EFFECT ON

00:21:06.064 --> 00:21:07.633
THE HOW IT WORKS PROGRAMS AS A

00:21:07.699 --> 00:21:08.834
WHOLE AT LEAST BETWEEN STAGE

00:21:08.900 --> 00:21:10.335
TWO AND STAGE THREE- BUT I'LL

00:21:10.402 --> 00:21:12.170
PASS IT OFF TO MY L. A. O. OR

00:21:12.237 --> 00:21:14.239
C. CALLING WILL NOT BE JUST

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:16.608

THE RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:19.611
TRENDS BUT THEY'RE THE ONES

00:21:19.678 --> 00:21:21.880
MORE ABLE TO SPEAK TO WHY THE

00:21:21.947 --> 00:21:26.785
TRENDS. ARE HAPPENING IS THAT

00:21:26.852 --> 00:21:27.319
WHAT YOU'RE SUGGESTING. WE

00:21:37.963 --> 00:21:39.031
TIME BUT YOU'RE NOT PREPARED TO

00:21:39.097 --> 00:21:41.199
COMMENT ON WHY YOU SEE THE

00:21:41.266 --> 00:21:42.834
TRENDS HAPPENING. I'LL

00:21:42.901 --> 00:21:44.903
CERTAINLY LET THEM SPEAK TO-

00:21:44.970 --> 00:21:46.705
SINCE SPEECH YOUR WHAT'S GOING

00:21:46.772 --> 00:21:47.572
ON THE PERSONS THEY HAVE A MORE

00:21:47.639 --> 00:21:49.207
DIRECT LINE- TO WHAT'S

00:21:49.274 --> 00:21:50.375
HAPPENING TO PROVIDERS ON THE

00:21:50.442 --> 00:21:51.476
GROUND I WILL SAY WHEN WE

00:21:51.543 --> 00:21:53.145
DERECHOS CONVERSATIONS WE KNOW

00:21:53.211 --> 00:21:54.813
THAT. THERE ARE CERTAINLY A LOT

00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.314
OF CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE SEEING

00:21:56.381 --> 00:21:58.083
IN THOSE PROGRAMS ONE AT LEAST

00:21:58.150 --> 00:21:59.518
TRY AND THAT WE'RE NOTICING IT.

00:21:59.584 --> 00:22:01.687
EVER SINCE. I WAS TWELVE MONTH

00:22:01.753 --> 00:22:02.888
ELIGIBILITY WAS INTRODUCED IN

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:04.656
THOSE PROGRAMS. I'LL WE MAY BE

00:22:04.723 --> 00:22:07.159
SEEING SOME. SOME FAMILY

00:22:07.225 --> 00:22:08.226
STAYING IN THE STATE RUN

00:22:08.293 --> 00:22:09.327
PROGRAM THE LONGER AS OPPOSED

00:22:09.394 --> 00:22:10.629
TO GOING INTO THE STATE STREET

00:22:10.696 --> 00:22:11.897
PROGRAM SO THAT COULD BE PART

00:22:11.963 --> 00:22:13.298
OF THE REASON WHY WE'RE SEEING

00:22:13.365 --> 00:22:14.566
WHAT WE ARE SEEING. STAGE TWO

00:22:14.633 --> 00:22:17.703
OKAY LET ME GO TO THAT LA- WHEN

00:22:17.769 --> 00:22:18.303
ASKED IF YOU WOULD COMMENT ON

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:23.275
THAT. WHY DO YOU THINK THESE

00:22:23.341 --> 00:22:24.509
TRENDS MIGHT BE HAPPENING- IN

00:22:24.576 --> 00:22:26.845
THE ONE THING ALL I- TO. OF

00:22:26.912 --> 00:22:29.681
COMMON IS. A THESE ESTá. THAT

00:22:29.748 --> 00:22:30.148
YOU KNOW THESE ARE THE

00:22:30.215 --> 00:22:31.149
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES AT

00:22:31.216 --> 00:22:32.851
THIS POINT- BUT THE AGREED UPON

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:35.320
ESTIMATES ARE TRYING TO-

00:22:35.387 --> 00:22:37.255
PREDICT WHAT CASELOAD WILL BE

00:22:37.322 --> 00:22:38.356
IN THE FUTURE SO IT'S BEEN

00:22:38.423 --> 00:22:40.392
QUITE. A DIFFICULT TASK IN THE

00:22:40.459 --> 00:22:42.060
LAST FEW YEARS. I'M WITH THE

00:22:42.127 --> 00:22:43.528
IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OF THESE

00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:44.930
ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THAT

00:22:44.996 --> 00:22:46.832
HAVE CHANGED ON THE CASE THAT

00:22:46.898 --> 00:22:48.600
ESTIMATE SO DRASTICALLY. SO IF

00:22:48.667 --> 00:22:50.869
YOU YEARS AGO- AND THIS PARTNER

00:22:50.936 --> 00:22:51.903
JUST MENTION TWELVE MONTH

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:53.638
ELIGIBILITY SO A FEW YEARS AGO.

00:22:53.705 --> 00:22:55.273
WHEN TOLD WITH ELIGIBILITY WAS

00:22:55.340 --> 00:22:57.609
IMPLEMENTED- FOR STAGE TWO AND

00:22:57.676 --> 00:23:00.245
THREE FIRST- WE REALLY DID SEE.

00:23:00.312 --> 00:23:01.880
A STAGE TWO AND THREE CASELOAD

00:23:01.947 --> 00:23:02.781
REALLY INCREASE QUITE

00:23:02.848 --> 00:23:04.783
DRASTICALLY. I'M IN SO NOW IF

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.418
YOU YEARS DOWN THE LINE. TOLD

00:23:06.485 --> 00:23:07.619
WITH KNOWLEDGE ABILITY WAS NOT

00:23:07.686 --> 00:23:09.688
IMPLEMENTED STAGE ONE. AND

00:23:09.755 --> 00:23:11.790
WE'RE WE'RE SEEING- READ THE

00:23:11.857 --> 00:23:13.091
DATA REFLECTING THAT THE

00:23:13.158 --> 00:23:15.127
STATE'S ESTACIO QUESADILLAS IS

00:23:15.193 --> 00:23:21.066
DECREASING. QUITE DRASTICALLY

00:23:21.133 --> 00:23:23.969
ALL. YEAH MONITORING THE DATA

00:23:24.035 --> 00:23:25.036
SO I THINK IN WORKING. TO LOOK

00:23:25.103 --> 00:23:26.905
INTO AND I'M ANALYZE TO MAKE IT

00:23:26.972 --> 00:23:27.606
TO ENSURE THAT THE ADMIN.

00:23:27.672 --> 00:23:29.107
ESTIMATES REASON. ON THE THAT

00:23:29.174 --> 00:23:31.576
STILL WORK AT. WILL CAN TO DO

00:23:31.643 --> 00:23:33.078
AS WE AS WE HEAD INTO THE

00:23:33.145 --> 00:23:34.679
SPRING. I'M ASKING A MOMENT THE

00:23:34.746 --> 00:23:35.881
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO

00:23:35.947 --> 00:23:37.749
COMMENT BUT LET ME ASK YOU JUST

00:23:37.816 --> 00:23:39.551
ONE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IT SEEMS

00:23:39.618 --> 00:23:41.486
FROM YOUR ANSWER. THAT YOU'RE

00:23:41.553 --> 00:23:42.687
BASICALLY SAYING THESE TRENDS

00:23:42.754 --> 00:23:44.823
WERE IN EVIDENCE FOR A PERIOD

00:23:44.890 --> 00:23:45.857
OF TIME THAT WAS BEFORE THE

00:23:45.924 --> 00:23:48.627
PANDEMIC SO IT'S NOT REALLY A

00:23:48.693 --> 00:23:51.329
PANDEMIC IMPACT. THE YOUR

00:23:51.396 --> 00:23:54.800
NOTING IS RELATED TO THIS

00:23:54.866 --> 00:23:57.969
REDUCTION. YEAH SO- IF SOME OF

00:23:58.036 --> 00:23:59.271
IT COULD BE PANDEMICS ARE NOT

00:23:59.337 --> 00:24:00.839
QUITE SURE YET TO BE ABLE TO

00:24:00.906 --> 00:24:02.007
PARK STYLE KIND OF THE

00:24:02.073 --> 00:24:03.074
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN LIKE

00:24:03.141 --> 00:24:05.076
PANDEMIC RELATED. ON KEESLER

00:24:05.143 --> 00:24:06.912
TRENDS OR PRE PANDEMIC HE SAID

00:24:06.978 --> 00:24:08.146
TRYING BUT WE WILL NOTE THAT WE

00:24:08.213 --> 00:24:11.616
DID SEE. A DECREASE IN IN CASE

00:24:11.683 --> 00:24:12.918
A TRANSCRIPT HAD TO MAKE AND

00:24:12.984 --> 00:24:14.519
THEN ONCE A PANDEMIC STARTED IT

00:24:14.586 --> 00:24:16.421
DID IT DID. THE TRENDS THAT

00:24:16.488 --> 00:24:18.089
BECAME A LITTLE STEEPER OKAY

00:24:18.156 --> 00:24:19.291
LET ME ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:24:19.357 --> 00:24:22.494
EDUCATION IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT

00:24:22.561 --> 00:24:23.895
ON THE STREETS. I THINK WE

00:24:23.962 --> 00:24:25.263
WOULD SHARE AN ECHO WETNESS

00:24:25.330 --> 00:24:28.567
CORTEZ AND- RIGHT YOU SAD THAT

00:24:28.633 --> 00:24:30.135
WE SAW THESE TRENDS START

00:24:30.202 --> 00:24:32.170
BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND WE'VE

00:24:32.237 --> 00:24:35.173
SEEN AND CONTINUE ON THANK YOU.

00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:36.575
THESE ARE POCKET SIZED THAT

00:24:36.641 --> 00:24:37.609
TWELVE MONTH ELIGIBILITY

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:39.744
DEFINITELY PLAYED A ROLE BUT

00:24:39.811 --> 00:24:41.680
WITHOUT A CLEAR PEOPLE HAVE

00:24:41.746 --> 00:24:42.881
STEPPED OVER THE HARD FOR US TO

00:24:42.948 --> 00:24:44.683
ACTUALLY SEE THE DIRECT CAUSE

00:24:44.749 --> 00:24:46.384
EVENTS ALL WE CAN DO IS WORK

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.119
ACROSS SOME OF THE POLICIES

00:24:48.186 --> 00:24:50.355
THAT WERE IMPLEMENTED. AND THAT

00:24:50.422 --> 00:24:50.922
TWELVE MONTHS WOULD BE THE

00:24:50.989 --> 00:24:53.191
LARGEST ONE- AND AT THE SAME

00:24:53.258 --> 00:24:54.826
TIME WITH THE PANDEMIC

00:24:54.893 --> 00:24:56.528
CALIFORNIA FARMERS SERVICES IS

00:24:56.595 --> 00:24:59.197
ALSO NOW. INITIATED THE TWELVE

00:24:59.264 --> 00:25:01.166
MONTH FOR STAGE ONE SO WE MAY

00:25:01.233 --> 00:25:03.768
BE SEEING MORE CHILDREN HELD IN

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.604
STAGE ONE BEFORE THEY MOVED TO

00:25:05.670 --> 00:25:07.205
STAGE TWO ONE THREE. ALL OF

00:25:07.272 --> 00:25:11.343
THOSE TRENDS OR SOMETHING. THAT

00:25:11.409 --> 00:25:12.744
WILL. WATCH OVER ME. HERE'S TO

00:25:12.811 --> 00:25:14.212
REALLY ON YOUR- THE INNER. OF

00:25:14.279 --> 00:25:17.849
BUT POLICY AS WELL AS EXTERNAL

00:25:17.916 --> 00:25:20.185
FACTORS LIKE. THEN LET ME GO TO

00:25:20.252 --> 00:25:22.587
A GLOBAL QUESTION THAT MIGHT

00:25:22.654 --> 00:25:24.022
RELATE TO THIS AND START WITH

00:25:24.089 --> 00:25:27.225
THE L. A. O. IN RESPONSE. I

00:25:27.292 --> 00:25:28.693
WONDER IF YOU HAD DATA ON THE

00:25:28.760 --> 00:25:30.896
NUMBER AND TYPES OF PROVIDERS

00:25:30.962 --> 00:25:32.063
THAT MAY HAVE CLOSED

00:25:32.130 --> 00:25:34.099
PERMANENTLY OR TEMPORARILY

00:25:34.165 --> 00:25:37.102
DURING THE PANDEMIC AND IT AND

00:25:37.168 --> 00:25:39.738
REFLECTING ON THAT- HOW THAT

00:25:39.804 --> 00:25:42.874
MADE HIM. IMPACT RE OPENING OF

00:25:42.941 --> 00:25:45.443
THE STATE'S ECONOMY WHEN WE GET

00:25:45.510 --> 00:25:48.046
TO IT HELLO. ERROR AND SO THERE

00:25:48.113 --> 00:25:49.547
IS ACTUALLY SOME INFORMATION

00:25:49.614 --> 00:25:51.650
PROVIDED IN YOUR AGENDA- ON

00:25:51.716 --> 00:25:53.551
THIS EXACT QUESTION ON PAGE SIX

00:25:53.618 --> 00:25:54.619
I'M SO ONE THING I'LL NOTE

00:25:54.686 --> 00:25:56.454
ABOUT THIS DATA IS THAT THIS IS

00:25:56.521 --> 00:25:58.556
THE ENTIRE WORLD. OUR LIFE OF

00:25:58.623 --> 00:26:00.258
THE STATE'S LICENSE I'M CHILD

00:26:00.325 --> 00:26:01.593
CARE PROVIDER IN THE STATE A

00:26:01.660 --> 00:26:02.227
COUNTRY THAT APARTMENT A SOCIAL

00:26:02.294 --> 00:26:04.529
SERVICES- SO WHAT THIS IS NOT

00:26:04.596 --> 00:26:06.398
SHOWING YOU IS MORE SPECIFIC TO

00:26:06.464 --> 00:26:07.465
THE SUBSIDIZED CHILDCARE

00:26:07.532 --> 00:26:08.833
PROGRAMS THAT WE ARE TALKING

00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:11.503
ABOUT TODAY IN- IN IN STAGES

00:26:11.569 --> 00:26:13.738
OKAY MORE SPECIFICALLY TO YOUR

00:26:13.805 --> 00:26:17.609
pTO. TWO OR THREE SO- THIS DATA

00:26:17.676 --> 00:26:20.011
SHOWS CAN BECOME YOUR BREAK OUT

00:26:20.078 --> 00:26:22.380
OF AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:24.049
WHO IS OPEN AND OPERATING WHO

00:26:24.115 --> 00:26:26.017
IS TEMPORARY- HOW MANY-

00:26:26.084 --> 00:26:27.185
FACILITIES AND KIND OF HOW THAT

00:26:27.252 --> 00:26:29.421
EQUATES TO THE NUMBER OF SLOTS-

00:26:29.487 --> 00:26:30.889
FOR TEMPORARY CLOSE. AND THEN

00:26:30.956 --> 00:26:33.191
ALSO- IS PERMANENTLY CLOSED

00:26:33.258 --> 00:26:35.226
SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY

00:26:35.293 --> 00:26:36.795
BUT IT THOSE NUMBERS DON'T

00:26:36.861 --> 00:26:39.264
REFLECT ON THE ABILITY TO RE

00:26:39.331 --> 00:26:41.599
OPEN TO HAVE ANY IDEA WHETHER

00:26:41.666 --> 00:26:43.969
THAT'S JUST A- A COMPILATION OF

00:26:44.035 --> 00:26:46.671
CLOSURE. IT IN ANY IDEA WHAT

00:26:46.738 --> 00:26:51.576
WOULD BE READY. TO RE OPEN IF

00:26:51.643 --> 00:26:52.777
WE MOVED TO THAT. YEAH THAT SO

00:26:52.844 --> 00:26:53.645
A QUESTION I KNOW AND HAVE

00:26:53.712 --> 00:26:55.513
ANSWERS THE WAY WE CAN GET SOME

00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:56.815
OF THAT INFORMATION IS THROUGH

00:26:56.881 --> 00:26:58.149
BY RELYING ON SOME OF THE

00:26:58.216 --> 00:27:00.251
SURVEY DATA. SURVEY INFORMATION

00:27:00.318 --> 00:27:01.219
THAT HAS BEEN DONE BY OTHER

00:27:01.286 --> 00:27:04.656
ORGANIZATIONS- AND THEN THE

00:27:04.723 --> 00:27:06.558
SURVEYS HAVE REALLY BEEN.

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:07.692
TRYING TO GET OUT KIND OF WHAT

00:27:07.759 --> 00:27:08.693
ARE THE BARRIERS AND WHAT ARE

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.729
THE ISSUES THAT- CHILD CARE

00:27:10.795 --> 00:27:12.664
PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN FACING. IS

00:27:12.731 --> 00:27:13.765
THAT SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:27:13.832 --> 00:27:15.633
THEY THE SURVEY FINDINGS

00:27:15.700 --> 00:27:17.469
HARVARD HAVE SHOWN IS THAT.

00:27:17.535 --> 00:27:19.137
CHILD CARE PROVIDER FACING

00:27:19.204 --> 00:27:21.172
HIGHER COSTS FROM CLEAN

00:27:21.239 --> 00:27:23.041
PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT.

00:27:23.108 --> 00:27:24.776
BUT THEY'RE ALSO SERVING- FEWER

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:26.544
CHILDREN AND SO THERE WERE THE

00:27:26.611 --> 00:27:28.213
RECEIVING INCOME FROM FROM

00:27:28.279 --> 00:27:30.048
CERTAIN FEWER CHILDREN. LET ME

00:27:30.115 --> 00:27:34.085
ASK IF THE DEPARTMENT. OF

00:27:34.152 --> 00:27:34.652
EDUCATION HAS ANY COMMENT ON

00:27:34.719 --> 00:27:38.623
THAT. AT ONCE AGAIN I THINK WE

00:27:38.690 --> 00:27:40.992
WOULD ECHO. WHAT IT. HAS IT'S

00:27:41.059 --> 00:27:44.396
JUST SAD IN ADDITION MAKING. AS

00:27:44.462 --> 00:27:46.464
WE'VE LOOKED AT THE COMPANY

00:27:46.531 --> 00:27:48.366
ENVIRONMENT WE KNOW. DOT IN THE

00:27:48.433 --> 00:27:50.702
SERVING LESS CHILDREN THAT HAS

00:27:50.769 --> 00:27:53.038
OBVIOUSLY IMPACTED PROVIDERS AS

00:27:53.104 --> 00:27:56.107
WELL. WRITERS REASONABLE ABLE

00:27:56.174 --> 00:27:58.143
TO HOME THIS YEAR AND THAT IS

00:27:58.209 --> 00:28:00.011
SOMETHING THEY REQUESTED FOR

00:28:00.078 --> 00:28:01.880
NEXT YEAR AS WELL USER THAT

00:28:01.946 --> 00:28:03.815
THEY HAVE ACCESSIBILITY BUT

00:28:03.882 --> 00:28:07.085
WITH SERVING LESS CHILDREN AND-

00:28:07.152 --> 00:28:08.553
SMALLER GROUPS FROM THIS IT

00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:09.854
MEANS YOU'RE BRINGING LOS

00:28:09.921 --> 00:28:11.656
RUNNING INTO THE PROGRAM WE

00:28:11.723 --> 00:28:12.490
ALSO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT ARE

00:28:12.557 --> 00:28:14.259
JUST. RIGHT FOR SOME OF THE

00:28:14.325 --> 00:28:15.794
CHILDREN ARE COMING IN PERSON

00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:17.128
WHAT ARE ALSO SERVING MOM

00:28:17.195 --> 00:28:19.030
AREN'T REMOTELY AND SET THAT IS

00:28:19.097 --> 00:28:24.969
ADDING ADDITIONAL COSTS. SO

00:28:25.036 --> 00:28:25.570
WELL WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY.

00:28:25.637 --> 00:28:28.106
THAT IS CLOSE WITH RETURN AND

00:28:28.173 --> 00:28:29.808
COME BACK OPEN. ARMS THAT'S

00:28:29.874 --> 00:28:30.442
SOMETHING I THINK THE CRIME IS

00:28:30.508 --> 00:28:32.377
THE RIGHT NOW AS LOOK TO

GETTING OUT SOMEONE ACCESS

00:28:42.087 --> 00:28:44.222
POINT IN YOU JUST RAISE THE NOT

00:28:44.289 --> 00:28:45.924
KNOW. I THINK IT WAS A TO COME

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:48.626
UP LATER BUT- OF THE FACT THAT

00:28:48.693 --> 00:28:50.962
THEIR NATIONAL COSTS DUE TO

00:28:51.029 --> 00:28:52.564
SOME OF THE THINGS THE PANDEMIC

00:28:52.630 --> 00:28:54.799
HOW ARE THEY BEING COVERED IN

00:28:54.866 --> 00:28:58.503
TERMS OF SORT OF THE STATE

THEY'VE BEEN ABLE TO. I DON'T

00:29:10.849 --> 00:29:11.783
KNOW IF THEY WOULD TELL US THAT

00:29:11.850 --> 00:29:13.284
THEY WOULD COVER THEM BELIEVE

00:29:13.351 --> 00:29:15.120
THAT WE HAVE PUT OUT THE BUDGET

00:29:15.186 --> 00:29:16.988

THE END MAYBE TO. THAT THE- IS

00:30:00.565 --> 00:30:03.535
HELL HARM MEANING THAT THEY

00:30:03.601 --> 00:30:04.836
SERVED A HIGHER NUMBER OF

00:30:04.903 --> 00:30:06.404
PEOPLE BEFORE THE PANDEMIC AND

00:30:06.471 --> 00:30:08.439
THEIR CONTRACTORS STILL HELD IN

00:30:08.506 --> 00:30:09.541
PLACE EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE

00:30:09.607 --> 00:30:11.276
SERVING LESS PEOPLE TO COVER

00:30:11.342 --> 00:30:13.611
THE COSTS THAT MIGHT COME. FROM

00:30:13.678 --> 00:30:15.580

THE TEN AGAIN PRECIADO

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:29.060
PRESENTATION I DID ONE DELVIN-

00:30:29.127 --> 00:30:31.296
TO FOLLOW UP WITH- THE CHAIRS

00:30:31.362 --> 00:30:32.964
QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NUMBERS

00:30:33.031 --> 00:30:34.365
HERE FOR STAGE ONE TWO AND

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:35.633
THREE. AND I CERTAINLY

00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.771
UNDERSTAND- IN YOUR

00:30:39.837 --> 00:30:42.473
PRESENTATIONS- BUT I GUESS YOU

00:30:42.540 --> 00:30:43.608
DON'T WANT YOUR EXPLANATIONS

00:30:43.675 --> 00:30:47.645
AND I HAVE SEEN THAT- WITH

00:30:47.712 --> 00:30:48.947
TWELVE MONTHS ELIGIBILITY YEAH

00:30:49.013 --> 00:30:49.847
YOU HAVE MORE PEOPLE STAYING

00:30:49.914 --> 00:30:51.316
STAGE ONE VERSUS PROGRESS IN

00:30:51.382 --> 00:30:53.351
STAGE TWO BUT I WOULD ALSO MAKE

00:30:53.418 --> 00:30:55.353
NOTE THAT THE- THIS. IS TRULY

00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:57.288
MAINLY DISPLACEMENT WE WOULD

00:30:57.355 --> 00:30:59.224
SEE A LARGE INCREASE THE STAGE

00:30:59.290 --> 00:31:00.191
ONE COMMENSURATE WITH THE

00:31:00.258 --> 00:31:03.194
DECREASE IN STAGE TWO. SO BUT

00:31:03.261 --> 00:31:04.495
WE DON'T SEE THAT SO SOMETHING

00:31:04.562 --> 00:31:06.831
ELSE IS GOING ON- BECAUSE WE

00:31:06.898 --> 00:31:08.800
HAVE A TWO POINT FOUR ENTRIES.

00:31:08.866 --> 00:31:11.035
IN STAGE ONE FOR PROJECTED BUT

00:31:11.102 --> 00:31:12.470
THEN AT EIGHTEEN POINT 5%

00:31:12.537 --> 00:31:13.771
DECREASE AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE

00:31:13.838 --> 00:31:15.073
ACTUAL RAW NUMBERS YOU CAN SEE

00:31:15.139 --> 00:31:17.008
ALSO THAT THE- THE ACTUAL RUN

00:31:17.075 --> 00:31:18.843
NUMBERS- THERE'S A BIG CHANGE

00:31:18.910 --> 00:31:21.579
HERE TOO. RIGHT SO EIGHT

00:31:21.646 --> 00:31:24.582
HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN UP VERSUS

00:31:24.649 --> 00:31:26.351
TEN THOUSAND DOWN. SO- SO

00:31:26.417 --> 00:31:28.052
PERHAPS CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT

00:31:28.119 --> 00:31:29.187
AND ALSO I GUESS THE OTHER

00:31:29.254 --> 00:31:30.822
THING IS HE DIED IN SUB THREE

00:31:30.888 --> 00:31:32.624
WE ALSO- HAD A PRESENTATION

00:31:32.690 --> 00:31:34.692
EARLIER ON CAL WORKS. I GUESS

00:31:34.759 --> 00:31:35.493
WHEN THE QUESTIONS WHEN THE

00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:36.894
MYSTERIES I SHOULD SAY BECAUSE

00:31:36.961 --> 00:31:37.829
WE DIDN'T REALLY GET A GOOD

00:31:37.895 --> 00:31:39.197
EXPLANATION WAS THAT THERE WAS

00:31:39.264 --> 00:31:40.965
A FALLEN CAL WORKS KNOWING THAT

00:31:41.032 --> 00:31:42.967
STAGE ONE STAGE TWO ARE.

00:31:43.034 --> 00:31:46.671
POTENTIALLY. ENTITLEMENTS FOR

00:31:46.738 --> 00:31:48.506
PEOPLE ON CAL WORKS. HOW MUCH

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:52.677
OF THIS IS DUE TO- EIGHT EIGHT

00:31:52.744 --> 00:31:54.279
PROJECTION THAT POWER DOESN'T

00:31:54.345 --> 00:31:55.313
GOING TO INCREASE LIKE WE

00:31:55.380 --> 00:31:56.614
THOUGHT IT WAS WITH THE

00:31:56.681 --> 00:31:58.950
PANDEMIC BUT I GUESS THAT LAMB

00:31:59.017 --> 00:32:00.685
I GUESS I'M CONCERNED THAT ONCE

00:32:00.752 --> 00:32:01.586
PEOPLE RUN OUT THEIR EMPLOYMENT

00:32:01.653 --> 00:32:03.354
SO FOURTH WE WEREN'T SURE THAT

00:32:03.421 --> 00:32:04.822
CAO WORKS WASN'T GOING TO SIR

00:32:04.889 --> 00:32:06.958
JUMPING UP. AND WHEN THAT WAS

00:32:07.025 --> 00:32:09.394
GOING TO HAPPEN SO- AND PERHAPS

00:32:09.460 --> 00:32:10.962
MAYBE BY MAY REVISE IT HAVE

00:32:11.029 --> 00:32:12.964
BETTER NUMBERS- BUT I THINK.

00:32:13.031 --> 00:32:14.766
THIS MAY ALSO BE PARTIALLY TIED

00:32:14.832 --> 00:32:16.234
TO THIS MYSTERY ABOUT WHY CAO

00:32:16.301 --> 00:32:18.136
WORKS HASN'T GONE UP AS MUCH IS

00:32:18.202 --> 00:32:19.537
EXPECTED AND WE NEVER GOT A

00:32:19.604 --> 00:32:21.539
REALLY GOOD ANSWER FOR THAT AND

00:32:21.606 --> 00:32:22.173
I THINK PEOPLE ARE STILL TRYING

00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:24.075
TO FIGURE IT OUT. GEN SO CAN

00:32:24.142 --> 00:32:25.476
THERE BE A KEY PLEASE COMMENT

00:32:25.543 --> 00:32:27.578
ON. BOTH ALL OF THE

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:29.947
DISPLACEMENT ISSUE AS WELL AS-

00:32:30.014 --> 00:32:32.083
HOW MUCH IS TO BE AFFECTED BY-

00:32:32.150 --> 00:32:33.651
POTENTIAL CHANGES AND CAL WORKS

00:32:33.718 --> 00:32:36.654
THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE

00:32:36.721 --> 00:32:37.188
ANTICIPATING- IN THE NEXT

00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:41.659
FISCAL YEAR. THERE'S A SERVER

00:32:41.726 --> 00:32:42.760
NOW FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.162
FINANCE SO I'LL JUST GO AHEAD

00:32:44.228 --> 00:32:45.763
AND START AND SAY THAT I DO

00:32:45.830 --> 00:32:46.931
THINK WE AGREE THAT THE

00:32:46.998 --> 00:32:48.833
MYSTERIES THAT WE SEE ARE. ARE

00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:50.168
VERY DIFFICULT TO TEASE OUT WE

00:32:50.234 --> 00:32:52.170
DON'T HAVE EXACT DATA ABOUT

00:32:52.236 --> 00:32:53.504
EXACTLY WHAT IS HAPPENING IN

00:32:53.571 --> 00:32:54.539
THE PROGRAMS IN TERMS OF THE

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:56.207
POLICY CHANGES THAT HAPPEN. AND

00:32:56.274 --> 00:32:57.508
HOW THAT AFFECTS CASELOAD IN

00:32:57.575 --> 00:32:58.910
COST PER CASE SO THAT'S

00:32:58.976 --> 00:32:59.744
SOMETHING WE TRY TO TEASE OUT

00:32:59.811 --> 00:33:02.113
EVERY YEAR- AND THAT'S WHY WE

00:33:02.180 --> 00:33:03.114
WORK SO CLOSELY WITH OUR

00:33:03.181 --> 00:33:04.115
COLLEAGUES FOR TO AND TRY TO

00:33:04.182 --> 00:33:05.183
UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING

00:33:05.249 --> 00:33:07.251
AND SOMETIMES. WHAT WE SEE IN

00:33:07.318 --> 00:33:09.120
THE DATA DOES NOT REFLECT WHAT

00:33:09.187 --> 00:33:10.355
WE THINK WOULD HAPPEN AND SO WE

00:33:10.421 --> 00:33:11.923
JUST MAKE OUR BEST ESTIMATES

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:13.624
BASED OFF THAT- AND YOU ARE

00:33:13.691 --> 00:33:15.026
CORRECT IN MAY REVISION WE WILL

00:33:15.093 --> 00:33:16.828
HAVE UPDATED CASELOAD NUMBERS

00:33:16.894 --> 00:33:17.829
AN UPDATED COST PER CASE

00:33:17.895 --> 00:33:19.130
NUMBERS AS WELL. SO WE'LL HAVE

00:33:19.197 --> 00:33:21.065
A LITTLE BIT ABOVE MORE REFINED

00:33:21.132 --> 00:33:23.468
ESTIMATE THEN- AND YEAH SO I

00:33:23.534 --> 00:33:24.902
WOULD JUST SAY THAT THOSE ARE

00:33:24.969 --> 00:33:26.471
ALL THINGS THAT WE AGREE ARE

00:33:26.537 --> 00:33:27.805
ALSO MYSTERIES THAT WE TRY TO

00:33:27.872 --> 00:33:29.407
FIGURE OUT AND WE DON'T HAVE.

00:33:29.474 --> 00:33:31.542
GREAT NUMBERS ARE. PARTICULARLY

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:32.810
CONSIDERING THAT THE

00:33:32.877 --> 00:33:34.112
INTERACTION EFFECT OF A LOT OF

00:33:34.178 --> 00:33:35.613
THESE TWO IS REALLY. DIFFICULT

00:33:35.680 --> 00:33:37.248
FOR US TO PART. SO WE'RE

00:33:37.315 --> 00:33:38.983
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT AND

00:33:39.050 --> 00:33:39.851
WHAT MORE UPDATED NUMBERS IN

00:33:39.917 --> 00:33:41.619
ME. AND I GUESS THE FOLLOW UP

00:33:41.686 --> 00:33:43.388
IS IF WE HAVE GUESSED WRONG BY

00:33:43.454 --> 00:33:49.494
MAY- AND WHEN WE WILL HAVE

00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:51.295
UPDATED NUMBERS IN MAY AND THEN

00:33:51.362 --> 00:33:52.363
TO THE EXTENT THAT CURRENT YOUR

00:33:52.430 --> 00:33:53.431
NUMBERS LOOK A LITTLE BIT

00:33:53.498 --> 00:33:54.565
DIFFERENT AS WELL WE TRY TO

00:33:54.632 --> 00:33:55.566
REMAIN AS RESPONSIVE AS

00:33:55.633 --> 00:33:58.936
POSSIBLE- TO ANNIE BUDGET

00:33:59.003 --> 00:33:59.537
REVISIONS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN

00:33:59.604 --> 00:34:03.341
FOR THESE PROGRAMS. OKAY ANY

00:34:03.408 --> 00:34:05.243
OTHER COMMENTS FROM. OTHER

00:34:05.309 --> 00:34:07.845
FOLKS. SURE I CAN'T COMMENT ON

00:34:07.912 --> 00:34:10.681
THE SERLIO. R. ONE THING I DID

00:34:10.748 --> 00:34:12.884
WANT TO MENTION IS THAT IN OUR

00:34:12.950 --> 00:34:14.252
WOULDN'T LEAD YOU INDEPENDENT

00:34:14.318 --> 00:34:15.853
ESTIMATES OF COLOR CHILD CARE

00:34:15.920 --> 00:34:17.688
AND FOR STAGE ONE THIS IS YOUR

00:34:17.755 --> 00:34:19.023
KIND OF HERE REACHED ON AT THE

00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:20.191
HEART OF THE ISSUE ONE OF THE

00:34:20.258 --> 00:34:22.126
THINGS THAT WE CONSIDER IS THE

00:34:22.193 --> 00:34:23.428
OVER ALL KIND OF WORKS

00:34:23.494 --> 00:34:26.264
AGREEMENT INTO OUR- STAGE ONE

00:34:26.330 --> 00:34:28.232
INTERSTAGE ONE ESTIMATES THAT

00:34:28.299 --> 00:34:29.267
ARE STAGE ONE ESTIMATES REALLY

00:34:29.333 --> 00:34:30.935
DO FEED INTO OUR STAGE AND

00:34:31.002 --> 00:34:31.903
STAGE TWO AND STAGE THREE

00:34:31.969 --> 00:34:33.638
ESTIMATE SO. THAT IS SOMETHING

00:34:33.704 --> 00:34:34.839
THAT WE WILL CONSIDER WHEN WE

00:34:34.906 --> 00:34:36.240
WHEN WE CAN DOCTOR INDEPENDENT

00:34:36.307 --> 00:34:37.542
ESTIMATES AND WE COMPARE THOSE

00:34:37.608 --> 00:34:39.076
TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S I'M AS

00:34:39.143 --> 00:34:40.278
AS WE CONTINUE ALONG THIS

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:41.979
BUDGET PROCESS OKAY SO ONE OF

00:34:42.046 --> 00:34:42.680
THE THINGS THAT MIGHT BE

00:34:42.747 --> 00:34:45.783
HELPFUL AS BY MAY IS MAYBE SOME

00:34:45.850 --> 00:34:47.718
SPARKLE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES I

00:34:47.785 --> 00:34:49.420
KNOW YOU DO YOUR BEST GUESS BUT

00:34:49.487 --> 00:34:50.788
SERVE A RANGE OF THINGS THAT

00:34:50.855 --> 00:34:53.090
MIGHT HAPPEN. GIVEN WHAT YOU

00:34:53.157 --> 00:34:54.759
KNOW WEEDS SENSOR STILL BIT OF

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.160
A MYSTERY ON CAL WORKS OF

00:34:56.227 --> 00:34:56.928
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN ACCOUNT

00:34:56.994 --> 00:34:57.995
WORK SO HOPEFULLY SOMEONE'S

00:34:58.062 --> 00:34:59.464
DELVING INTO UNEMPLOYMENT DATA

00:34:59.530 --> 00:35:01.632
AND OTHER TYPES OF THINGS. AND

00:35:01.699 --> 00:35:03.067
LOOKING AT SAYING OKAY WELL

00:35:03.134 --> 00:35:04.535
THIS IS A RANGE OF THINGS THAT

00:35:04.602 --> 00:35:07.805
MIGHT HAPPEN- AND- SO WE CAN IN

00:35:07.872 --> 00:35:09.640
THE- PERHAPS BETTER ANTICIPATE

TEND TO GIVE US IN A NUMBER BUT

00:35:13.511 --> 00:35:14.579
THE QUESTION IS HOW GOOD IS

THREE- CAN YOU CAN THERE BE AN

00:35:37.401 --> 00:35:38.636
EXPLANATION AS TO WHY THAT

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:39.837
PROJECTION WHEN THE NUMBERS

ONGOING SLOTS REMAINS THE SAME

00:36:28.519 --> 00:36:29.554
IT IS IN FACT A LITTLE BIT

00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:32.223
HIGHER WITH THE NEW PROPOSITION

00:36:32.290 --> 00:36:32.757

00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:44.936
HOPING THAT BY JULY FIRST- WILL

00:36:45.002 --> 00:36:46.504
BE IN A SITUATION WHERE YOU

00:36:46.571 --> 00:36:48.506

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:49.440
THAT THE TECHNICALLY THEY ARE

00:36:49.507 --> 00:36:51.008

WHOSE- VOUCHERS ARE EXPIRING

00:36:57.148 --> 00:36:58.816
THE CENTRAL WORKERS. THAT THE

00:48:48.058 --> 00:48:48.425
SEEMS TO BE SEVERELY

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:54.164
UNDERFUNDED. HI SIR BERNARD THE

00:48:54.231 --> 00:48:55.599
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO THE

00:48:55.666 --> 00:48:57.868
REGIONAL MARKET RATE- THE

00:48:57.934 --> 00:48:59.469
SURVEY IS CONDUCTED EVERY TWO

00:48:59.536 --> 00:49:02.372
YEARS- TO CAPTURE THE MOST

00:49:02.439 --> 00:49:04.241
RECENT INFORMATION ABOUT HOW

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:06.510
MUCH CHID CARE COSTS IN THE

00:49:06.576 --> 00:49:09.046
FIELD- AND- THERE THERE'S NO

00:49:09.112 --> 00:49:10.647
STATUTE THAT DOESN'T THERE'S AN

00:49:10.714 --> 00:49:11.915
INTENT BUT SAYS THAT WE WILL

00:49:11.982 --> 00:49:13.350
UPDATE TO THE MOST CURRENT RATE

00:49:13.417 --> 00:49:15.285
AND- WE CURRENTLY ARE NOT AT

00:49:15.352 --> 00:49:18.322
THE MOST RECENT SURVEY RATE- AT

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:19.890
TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN- BUT-

00:49:19.956 --> 00:49:20.657
STILL IT'S NOT THAT WE HAVE

00:49:20.724 --> 00:49:22.959
MORE CONVERSATIONS ABOUT RATES-

00:49:23.026 --> 00:49:24.461
THROUGH. THIS BODY TO THE

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:25.696
LEGISLATIVE PROCESS WITH OUR

00:49:25.762 --> 00:49:26.930
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE UNION

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.398
WILL WILL BE RESPONSIVE TO

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:30.167
THOSE BUT AT THIS POINT IN THE

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:33.937
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSALS ARE

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:34.404
NOT PROPOSING ANYTHING

00:49:34.471 --> 00:49:35.539
DIFFERENT AT THIS TIME. OKAY SO

00:49:35.605 --> 00:49:37.307
IF I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY YOU

00:49:37.374 --> 00:49:40.010
SAID IT SHOULD BE REEVALUATED

00:49:40.077 --> 00:49:41.878
EVERY TWO YEARS BUT IT HAS NOT.

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:45.415
IS THAT CORRECT. THERE'S AN

00:49:45.482 --> 00:49:46.950
INTENT TO DO SO ON THE LANGUAGE

00:49:47.017 --> 00:49:49.186
AT THE VERY LEAST- BUT THERE'S

00:49:49.252 --> 00:49:50.687
NOTHING THAT SAYS THAT- IN

00:49:50.754 --> 00:49:52.456
MINISTRATION TO UPDATE IT ON TO

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:55.325
THE TO THE MOST CURRENT ONE- SO.

00:49:55.392 --> 00:49:57.561
IT IS NOT AT THE MOST UPDATED-

00:49:57.627 --> 00:49:58.929
ARMOR SURVEY THAT THERE

00:49:58.995 --> 00:50:00.397
CURRENTLY IS RIGHT NOW. IN A

00:50:00.464 --> 00:50:01.531
NEW SURVEY IS BEING CONDUCTED

00:50:01.598 --> 00:50:02.966
AS WELL IT'S A LITTLE PUSHED

00:50:03.033 --> 00:50:04.768
OUT BECAUSE OF CO IN NINETEEN-

00:50:04.835 --> 00:50:07.037
BUT AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:07.604
PROPOSING ANY CHANGES TO THE

00:50:07.671 --> 00:50:10.440
RATES. SO JUST TO FOLLOW UP

00:50:10.507 --> 00:50:11.975
QUICKLY THERE'S AN INTENT TO DO

00:50:12.042 --> 00:50:14.344
IT BUT IT HASN'T BEEN DONE IS

00:50:14.411 --> 00:50:14.878
THAT BASICALLY WHAT YOU'RE

00:50:14.945 --> 00:50:19.983
SAYING. YES BUT THAT'S WHAT THE

00:50:20.050 --> 00:50:21.451
LANGUAGE OF THE MARKET. THANK

00:50:21.518 --> 00:50:23.720
YOU WHY IS THAT I'M JUST KIND

00:50:23.787 --> 00:50:25.288
OF CURIOUS I GENERAL TROUBLE

00:50:25.355 --> 00:50:28.825
YES. NON RECOGNIZING YOU TO ASK

00:50:28.892 --> 00:50:32.295
A QUESTION REYES ALL. HER

00:50:32.362 --> 00:50:35.899
QUESTION WAS WHY IS THAT. THANK

00:50:35.966 --> 00:50:39.102
YOU FOR CLARIFYING SO WE DO PAY

00:50:39.169 --> 00:50:40.804
ATTENTION VERY CLOSELY UNTIL

00:50:40.871 --> 00:50:41.805
YOU KNOW THE STRUGGLE THAT ARE

00:50:41.872 --> 00:50:42.773
HAPPENING IN THE CHILD CARE

00:50:42.839 --> 00:50:44.574
FIELD AND IN TERMS OF THE

00:50:44.641 --> 00:50:46.576
REIMBURSEMENT RATE ON THERE BUT

00:50:46.643 --> 00:50:48.278
A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS ABOUT

00:50:48.345 --> 00:50:50.313
ALIGNING THE RAIDS ABOUT MAKING

00:50:50.380 --> 00:50:51.848
A MORE EQUITABLE I BELIEVE THE

00:50:51.915 --> 00:50:52.949
MOST RECENT CHANGES THAT WE

00:50:53.016 --> 00:50:54.484
MADE HAD TO DO WITH ADJUSTMENT

00:50:54.551 --> 00:50:56.353
FACTORS FOR. INFANTS AND

00:50:56.420 --> 00:50:57.521
TODDLERS WHICH WE HEARD FROM

00:50:57.587 --> 00:50:59.122
THE FIELD HAS BEEN VERY

00:50:59.189 --> 00:51:01.892
HELPFUL- AND LOCAL THE NINETEEN

00:51:01.958 --> 00:51:03.126
HAPPENED LAST YEAR TOO THERE IS

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:04.461
EVEN MORE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT YOU

00:51:04.528 --> 00:51:06.496
KNOW WHAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:51:06.563 --> 00:51:08.432
WANTS TO DO IN TERMS OF YOU

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:09.266
KNOW BEING THERE FOR THE CHILD

00:51:09.332 --> 00:51:12.002
CARE FIELD- AND PROTECTING YOU

KNOW OUR FISCAL PICTURE AS WELL

00:51:13.870 --> 00:51:16.306
SO. TO THE EXTENT THAT A LOT OF

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:17.474
THESE CHANGES ARE HAPPENING THE

00:51:17.541 --> 00:51:18.809
FIELD WAS CALLED THE NINETEEN

00:51:18.875 --> 00:51:19.543
WITH THE TRANSITION WITH

00:51:19.609 --> 00:51:22.145
DIFFERENT THINGS LIKE THAT THE

00:51:22.212 --> 00:51:22.712
QUESTION OF THE CONVERSATION

00:51:22.779 --> 00:51:24.147
ABOUT RACE. I'M SURE WILL COME

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:25.248
UP AGAIN IT'S MENTIONED A

00:51:25.315 --> 00:51:26.450
LITTLE BIT IN THE MASTER PLAN

00:51:26.516 --> 00:51:29.419
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT THERE

00:51:29.486 --> 00:51:30.020
ARE MORE CONVERSATIONS IN THE

00:51:30.086 --> 00:51:32.122
FUTURE WILL CERTAINLY- YOU

00:51:32.189 --> 00:51:33.623
MEMBER OF THOSE AS WELL BUT IN

00:51:33.690 --> 00:51:34.357
TERMS OF WHAT'S IN THE

00:51:34.424 --> 00:51:37.461
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WE'RE NOT

00:51:37.527 --> 00:51:38.061
PROPOSING ANY CHANGES AT THIS

00:51:38.128 --> 00:51:39.629
TIME. SO MOVING FORWARD WHAT

00:51:39.696 --> 00:51:40.730
WOULD BE THE BEST COURSE OF

00:51:40.797 --> 00:51:42.866
ACTION TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

00:51:42.933 --> 00:51:46.369
THESE. FEES UPDATED. SO THAT WE

00:51:46.436 --> 00:51:50.006
COULD SEE MORE EQUITY AND MORE-

00:51:50.073 --> 00:51:50.574
CONSTANT RELIABILITY IN THE

00:51:50.640 --> 00:51:58.181
FUNDING. SANTA WITH THE

00:51:58.248 --> 00:51:59.216
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

00:51:59.282 --> 00:52:01.184
EDUCATION TESTS YOU BUILDUP LET

00:52:01.251 --> 00:52:05.155
pTHE TWENTY SIXTEEN RIGHT NOW

00:52:05.222 --> 00:52:07.457
BUT WE DO HAVE TO TWENTY

00:52:07.524 --> 00:52:09.292
EIGHTEEN REGARDING OUR- BUT

00:52:09.359 --> 00:52:10.594
WHAT ABOUT OUR TWENTY TWENTY

00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:12.262
SURVEY HAS BEEN PUSHED OUT DUE

00:52:12.329 --> 00:52:17.501
TO THE PANDEMIC AND SO MANY OF.

00:52:17.567 --> 00:52:19.669
THE PROGRAMS CLOSE. OPENCLOSE

00:52:19.736 --> 00:52:21.338
WE HAVE ASKED X. OF THAT

00:52:21.404 --> 00:52:22.839
DEPARTMENT OF GENERAL. AND ARE

00:52:22.906 --> 00:52:24.074
HOPING THAT THEY GRANT THAT

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:25.475
EXTENSION WHICH MEANS WE WOULD

00:52:25.542 --> 00:52:28.245
THEN HAVE. A NEW MARKET RATE

00:52:28.311 --> 00:52:32.582
FOR. ONE FULL. MEMBERS RATE THE

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:34.484
ADMINISTRATION JUST. DID IT

00:52:34.551 --> 00:52:36.186
INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY PARKING

00:52:36.253 --> 00:52:38.121
THE TODDLER CARE I'M NOT HAS

00:52:38.188 --> 00:52:39.289
HELPED STABILIZE THAT END OF

00:52:39.356 --> 00:52:41.157
THE SPECTRUM THE PRESCHOOL

00:52:41.224 --> 00:52:42.526
RIGHT HAS NOT BEEN ADDRESSED.

00:52:42.592 --> 00:52:44.127
YEARS SO I MENTIONED THAT

00:52:44.194 --> 00:52:45.996
EARLIER IN MY TALKING POINTS IS

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.931
THAT ACTUALLY LOWER THAN THEIR

00:52:47.998 --> 00:52:49.432
REGIONAL MARKETING FOR EXEMPTS

00:52:49.499 --> 00:52:51.401
CARE PROGRAM SO WHEN YOU THINK

00:52:51.468 --> 00:52:54.738
OF. THE HIGH QUALITY STANDARDS

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.239
FOR THE CALIFORNIA. LOWER AND

00:52:56.306 --> 00:52:59.976
MANY. OF LICENSE FROM. THERE'S

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:00.977
A LOT OF INEQUITIES AS LOOK

00:53:01.044 --> 00:53:03.613
ACROSS THE FIELD IN RIGHT. SO

00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.049
HOW SOON CAN WE SEE IF WE WERE

00:53:06.116 --> 00:53:07.884
TO MOVE FORWARD MAKING SURE

00:53:07.951 --> 00:53:08.718
ASSURING THAT WE HAD THIS

00:53:08.785 --> 00:53:11.087
INCREASED. TO HAVE THE MOST

00:53:11.154 --> 00:53:13.123
UPDATED AMOUNT STE OF THE

00:53:13.189 --> 00:53:15.725
REGIONAL MARKET RATES. HOW SOON

00:53:15.792 --> 00:53:17.193
COULD WE SEE THAT IN EFFECT HOW

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:29.940
LONG. DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION.

00:53:30.006 --> 00:53:31.207
S. SETTING OF RATES IS NOT

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:31.908
SOMETHING THE DEPARTMENT OF

00:53:31.975 --> 00:53:35.478
EDUCATION IS TO PROVIDE A

00:53:35.545 --> 00:53:36.980
TWENTY EIGHTEEN JOB MARKET RATE

00:53:37.047 --> 00:53:39.215
OKAY BUT THAT WOULD REALLY BE

00:53:39.282 --> 00:53:42.819
ANYA AND- I JUST PICTURE WERE-

00:53:42.886 --> 00:53:43.420
I'M ACTUALLY ADDRESSING HIGH

00:53:43.486 --> 00:53:49.125
WHAT'S OURS. I THINK- TROUBLE

00:53:49.192 --> 00:53:49.726
STRUGGLING TO FIGURE OUT WHEN

00:53:49.793 --> 00:53:51.861
THIS ACTUALLY GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:53:51.928 --> 00:53:53.663
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT THAT'S

00:53:53.730 --> 00:53:54.698
WHAT'S BEING INTERESTED IN THE

00:53:54.764 --> 00:53:56.366
ANSWER AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY

00:53:56.433 --> 00:53:58.068

00:53:58.134 --> 00:54:00.470
ADDRESS HER QUESTION OF MINE

00:54:00.537 --> 00:54:03.206
THIS WILL ACTUALLY HAPPEN. I

00:54:03.273 --> 00:54:04.407
CAN SPEAK TO THAT SERVER TYPES

00:54:04.474 --> 00:54:06.109
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

00:54:06.176 --> 00:54:08.345
I'M SO TYPICALLY WAY AND- THERE

00:54:08.411 --> 00:54:10.013
HAVE BEEN RATE INCREASES OF TO

00:54:10.080 --> 00:54:10.847
HAPPEN THROUGH THE BUDGET

00:54:10.914 --> 00:54:12.582
PROCESS I'M SURE THE LAST TIME

00:54:12.649 --> 00:54:14.117
THERE. REGIONAL MARKET RATE

00:54:14.184 --> 00:54:16.152
WAS- WAS INCREASED- THAT WAS

00:54:16.219 --> 00:54:17.721
DONE- THROUGH THE BUDGET

00:54:17.787 --> 00:54:19.823
AGREEMENT. THAT WAS PASSED AT

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:22.125
THE END OF JUNE HAS ACTIVE JULY

00:54:22.192 --> 00:54:24.327
ONE BUT THE ACTUAL RATE CHANGE

00:54:24.394 --> 00:54:26.363
WASN'T IMPLEMENTED UNTIL-

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:27.964
JANUARY MID YEAR WHICH GAVE THE

00:54:28.031 --> 00:54:29.466

PERIOD TO- TO. IMPLEMENT KIND

00:54:34.104 --> 00:54:34.838
OF THE CHANGES THAT ARE

00:54:34.904 --> 00:54:36.306
ASSOCIATED WITH THE RATE AND

00:54:36.373 --> 00:54:37.907
HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERS YOUR

00:54:37.974 --> 00:54:39.275

01:37:59.506 --> 01:38:02.209
BE BACK FILL POSITIONS ACCEDI-

01:38:02.276 --> 01:38:03.611
SO THE ADMINISTRATION NOTES IT

01:38:03.677 --> 01:38:05.279
WOULD NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT STAFF

01:38:05.346 --> 01:38:06.347
TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAMS

01:38:06.413 --> 01:38:08.048

01:38:13.721 --> 01:38:14.855
COMMENTS REGARDING PROPOSED. SO

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:16.323
WE WOULD KNOW THAT TODAY

IT'S CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE

01:38:28.936 --> 01:38:31.372
RESOURCES AND STAFFING NEEDED-

01:38:31.438 --> 01:38:32.673
WE ALL WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT THE

01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:34.575
COSTS WE ARE AWARE OF SO THE

01:38:34.642 --> 01:38:35.776
THIRTEEN MILLION A NOTED TO

01:38:35.843 --> 01:38:36.844
BACK FILL POSITIONS THAT CD

01:38:36.910 --> 01:38:38.412
EAT. ARE MUCH HIGHER THAN

01:38:38.479 --> 01:38:40.481
ANTICIPATED GIVEN THAT EXCEED

01:38:40.547 --> 01:38:41.782
THAT EXCEEDS THE COST OF THE

01:38:41.849 --> 01:38:42.683
PROPOSAL THAT THE

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:44.218
ADMINISTRATION WITHDREW LAST

01:38:44.285 --> 01:38:45.719
YEAR DUE TO COST CONCERNS AN

01:38:45.786 --> 01:38:48.122
OX. ASSEMBLY REFERRING TO THE

01:38:48.188 --> 01:38:49.456
PROPOSAL TO CREATE A NEW

01:38:49.523 --> 01:38:50.524
DEPARTMENT TO ADMINISTER THESE

01:38:50.591 --> 01:38:53.294
PROGRAMS- THE PROPOSAL SHIFTED

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.729
TO GO UNDER DSS. FOR AT THE

01:38:55.796 --> 01:39:01.669
COST. DUE TO COST CONCERNS- AND

01:39:01.735 --> 01:39:02.970
THEN SELECTING NO REGARDING THE

01:39:03.037 --> 01:39:04.505
CALL OF THE- IS THAT THE COSTS

01:39:04.571 --> 01:39:06.173
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH BEING ABLE

01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.508
TO MAINTAIN THE SAME LEVEL OF

01:39:07.574 --> 01:39:08.976
ADMINISTRATION BUT JUST HAVING

01:39:09.043 --> 01:39:10.411
THAT ADMINISTRATION HAPPENED

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:11.345
WITHIN A DIFFERENT STATE

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:13.280
DEPARTMENT THE COSTS ARE NOT

01:39:13.347 --> 01:39:14.715
ASSOCIATED WITH ANY SPECIFIC

01:39:14.782 --> 01:39:16.483
IMPROVEMENTS TO STATE LEVEL

01:39:16.550 --> 01:39:17.918
ADMINISTRATION. THE WE

01:39:17.985 --> 01:39:19.086
RECOGNIZE THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:19.153 --> 01:39:20.821
APPROVED THIS TRANSITION AS

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:22.756
PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE

01:39:22.823 --> 01:39:24.124
BUDGET PACKAGE GIVEN THE

01:39:24.191 --> 01:39:25.459
INFORMATION WE KNOW SO FAR THE

01:39:25.526 --> 01:39:26.593
LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO

01:39:26.660 --> 01:39:28.128
RECONSIDER CONTINUING WITH THE

01:39:28.195 --> 01:39:30.631
TRANSITION. AS PLANNED AND HAD

01:39:30.698 --> 01:39:31.532
SEVERAL OPTIONS MOVED TO MOVE

01:39:31.598 --> 01:39:33.834
FORWARD. THE FIRST OPTION IS TO

01:39:33.901 --> 01:39:35.202
STOP THE TRANSMISSION SO THE

01:39:35.269 --> 01:39:36.770
LEGISLATURE COULD DECIDE THAT

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:37.871
TRANSITIONING CHILD CARE

01:39:37.938 --> 01:39:39.840
PROGRAMS AND THE C. A. C. F. HE

01:39:39.907 --> 01:39:41.775
THE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM- TO DS

01:39:41.842 --> 01:39:43.911
US IS NO LONGER A PRIORITY. SO

01:39:43.977 --> 01:39:45.212
THIS WOULD FREE UP THIRTEEN

01:39:45.279 --> 01:39:46.714
MILLION ONGOING GENERAL FUND

01:39:46.780 --> 01:39:47.614
RELATIVE TO THE GOVERNOR'S

01:39:47.681 --> 01:39:48.916
BUDGET PROPOSAL THAT WOULD BE

01:39:48.982 --> 01:39:51.785
AVAILABLE TO SUPPORT A

01:39:51.852 --> 01:39:53.287
LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES. THE

01:39:53.354 --> 01:39:54.088
SECOND OPTION FOR THE

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:55.789
LEGISLATURE WOULD BE TO DELAY

01:39:55.856 --> 01:39:57.157
THE TRANSITION. THIS WOULD

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:58.292
ALLOW THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:39:58.359 --> 01:40:00.027
FOCUS THE ENTIRE ATTENTION ON

01:40:00.094 --> 01:40:02.096
THE PANDEMIC RESPONSE. AND PLAN

01:40:02.162 --> 01:40:03.063
FOR THE TRANSITION ON THE

01:40:03.130 --> 01:40:04.665
SLOWER TIME LINE WEEDING

01:40:04.732 --> 01:40:06.133
DELAYING THE TRANSITION UNTIL A

01:40:06.200 --> 01:40:07.768
YEAR AFTER THE COUP IN NINETEEN

01:40:07.835 --> 01:40:09.403
OR AGENCY DECLARATION AS AND IT

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:11.305
WOULD BE A REASONABLE APPROACH.

01:40:11.372 --> 01:40:12.106
ON THE IN THE THIRD OPTION

01:40:12.172 --> 01:40:13.707
WOULD BE TO MODIFY THE SCOPE OF

01:40:13.774 --> 01:40:15.409
THE TRANSITION. THE LEGISLATURE

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:16.810
COULD REDUCE THE NUMBER O

01:40:16.877 --> 01:40:18.212
POSITION OF NUMBER PROGRAM

01:40:18.278 --> 01:40:20.614
SHIFTING TO DS US. IF THE

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:21.682
LEGISLATURE DOES DECIDE TO TAKE

01:40:21.749 --> 01:40:23.250
THIS APPROACH WE RECOMMEND

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:24.885
KEEPING THE C. A. C. F. P. THE

01:40:24.952 --> 01:40:26.420
NUTRITION PROGRAM THAT'S BEING

01:40:26.487 --> 01:40:28.856
PROPOSED TO MOVE AT CD- KEEPING

01:40:28.922 --> 01:40:30.958
NOT PROGRAM THAT. SO AND THAT'S

01:40:31.024 --> 01:40:32.526
GIVEN THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

01:40:32.593 --> 01:40:34.161
THIS FUNDING. THE COSTS

01:40:34.228 --> 01:40:35.629
ASSOCIATED WITH SHIFTING THIS

01:40:35.696 --> 01:40:37.030
PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY. THE

01:40:37.097 --> 01:40:38.932
LEGISLATURE COULD FURTHER

01:40:38.999 --> 01:40:39.833
MINIMIZES SCHOOL OF THE

01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.702
TRANSITION MY ALSO SHIFTING.

01:40:41.769 --> 01:40:43.771
CERTAIN CHILD CARE PROGRAM CITY

01:40:43.837 --> 01:40:45.439
EXCESS OF THIS LIKE JUST AN

01:40:45.506 --> 01:40:47.107
EXAMPLE OF THIS WOULD BE-

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:48.876
MOVING POWER STAGES TWO AND

01:40:48.942 --> 01:40:50.744
THREE- AND HAVING THE REST OF

01:40:50.811 --> 01:40:52.079
THE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS

01:40:52.146 --> 01:40:53.781
MAINTAIN THAT CD. AND TAKING A

01:40:53.847 --> 01:40:55.015
SMALLER SET OF PROGRAMS COULD

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:56.617
BE MORE MANAGEABLE FOR THE

01:40:56.683 --> 01:40:58.118
ADMINISTRATION AT THIS TIME.

01:40:58.185 --> 01:40:59.386
WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE DOES

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:01.121
DECIDE TO DO- WOULD YOU

01:41:01.188 --> 01:41:01.955
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE

01:41:02.022 --> 01:41:03.624
CONSIDERS MAINTAINING THE SAME

01:41:03.690 --> 01:41:05.993

01:58:54.393 --> 01:58:56.562
ARE SOME NUANCES ARE LIKE THE

01:58:56.629 --> 01:58:58.264
NITTY GRITTY COMPONENTS OF

01:58:58.331 --> 01:58:59.632
WHERE STAFF ARE AND WHERE'S THE

01:58:59.699 --> 01:59:01.801
FUNDING APPROPRIATION THAT DIVE

01:59:01.868 --> 01:59:04.337
INTO THAT JULY TIME PERIOD THAT

01:59:04.403 --> 01:59:06.005
YOU WE FLAGGED AS SOMETHING

01:59:06.072 --> 01:59:07.306
THAT NEEDS TO BE LOOKED AT MORE

01:59:07.373 --> 01:59:08.574
CLOSELY THERE ARE ALSO SOME

01:59:08.641 --> 01:59:10.042
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT DATABASE

01:59:10.109 --> 01:59:11.711
CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE

01:59:11.777 --> 01:59:13.179
ESPECIALLY AROUND THINGS LIKE

01:59:13.246 --> 01:59:15.481
THE PAYMENTS AND IN REGARDS TO

01:59:15.548 --> 01:59:17.817
THE CULTURE WE WOULD SAY JUST

01:59:17.884 --> 01:59:19.919
ASK- WHAT CAN. ART DIRECTOR

01:59:19.986 --> 01:59:22.788
JOHNSON AND HIS TRAVIS I'D BOTH

01:59:22.855 --> 01:59:24.524

01:59:24.590 --> 01:59:25.291
TO SUPPORTING CHILDREN AND

01:59:25.358 --> 01:59:26.092
FAMILIES I THINK THERE'S A

01:59:26.158 --> 01:59:28.628
SHARED PASSION AND COMMITMENT

01:59:28.694 --> 01:59:30.363
TO THE FIELDS THERE THE

01:59:30.429 --> 01:59:31.230
CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF

01:59:31.297 --> 01:59:33.165
EDUCATION HAS OPERATED EARLY

01:59:33.232 --> 01:59:35.001
LEARNING CARE PROGRAMS SINCE

01:59:35.067 --> 01:59:37.336
WORLD WAR TWO SO FAR OUR

01:59:37.403 --> 01:59:40.006
CULTURE IT REALLY IS THAT FROM

01:59:40.072 --> 01:59:41.507
BIRTH IT'S PART OF AN

01:59:41.574 --> 01:59:43.276
EDUCATIONAL CONTINUE M. AND

01:59:43.342 --> 01:59:46.279
WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON EARLY ADD

01:59:46.345 --> 01:59:48.447
AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SUPPORT

01:59:48.514 --> 01:59:50.750
NARROWING OR PREVENTING THE

01:59:50.816 --> 01:59:52.385
ACHIEVEMENT GAP. SO PEOPLE COME

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:54.820
AND BE COMMITTED TO EDUCATION

01:59:54.887 --> 01:59:57.490
AS PART OF THE WAY IT IS IN SO

01:59:57.557 --> 01:59:58.791
I WOULD SEE THE CITY CULTURE

01:59:58.858 --> 02:00:00.760
THAT'S UNIQUE ACROSS STATE

02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:02.795

EDUCATION FOR SPECIFIC REASON

02:00:07.366 --> 02:00:08.935
