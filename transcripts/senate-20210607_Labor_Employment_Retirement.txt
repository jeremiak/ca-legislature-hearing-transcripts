VISA EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE ALL EASILY FARMWORKERS WITH WRITTEN NOTICE OF KEY STATE AND FEDERAL EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR RIGHTS. DURING FEDERAL AND STATE EMERGENCIES AND DISASTERS. LAST YEAR MORE THAN TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND FOREIGN FARMWORKERS WERE IMPORTED BY ROUGHLY ONE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA GROWERS AND FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS UNDER THE H. TWO A. FEDERAL VISA PROGRAM. THIS NUMBER HAS BEEN INCREASING ANNUALLY THESE TO ME FARMWORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ARE LARGELY RECRUITED IN MEXICO ARE TIED TO A SINGLE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYER WHO PROVIDES THEM WITH HOUSING MEALS AND TRANSPORTATION TO WORK SITES. MANY IS TO YOU IS TO WORKERS I'VE NEVER BEEN TO CAL BEFORE. ANOTHER SPEAK OR READ ENGLISH. IF YOU'RE FIRED FOR ANY REASON THEY'RE SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE DEPORTATION WHICH IS A POWERFUL DISINCENTIVE TO REPORT ANY ABUSE OF BURKE PLEASE CONDITIONS THEY ARE SUBJECTED TO. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN SEVEN SIMPLY REQUIRES H. TWO AM PLAYERS TO PROVIDE EASILY FARMWORKERS ON THEIR FIRST DAY OF WORK. A SHORT COMPREHENSIVE WRITTEN SUMMARY OF KEY LABOR TRANSPORTATION RELATED. HOUSING AND HEALTH AND SAFETY LAWS IN SPANISH. AND FOR QUESTION IN ENGLISH. THE BILL ALSO DIRECTS THE LABOR COMMISSIONER DEVELOP A TEMPLATE CONTAINING THE SUMMARY AND A POSTER ON THE WEBSITE FOR EACH TO EMPLOYERS TO USED TO COMPLY WITH THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT. H. B. EIGHTY SEVEN CREATES A SEPARATE LEGALLY COMPLIANT WORKPLACE FOR AGE TWENTY FARMWORKERS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT ON THIS BILL IS MARK SHOT THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION. CYNTHIA RICE DIRECTOR OF LITIGATION ADVOCACY AND TRAINING FOR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER- WE WILL MOVE INTO THE LEAD SUPPORT WITNESS MARC SCHECHTER. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS- MARKS OUT THE CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL- THE BILL ADDRESSES A SINGULAR PROBLEM FACED BY AGE TO A FARMWORKERS TO ENTER CALIFORNIA UNDER FEDERALLY APPROVED JOB OFFERS. THAT OFTEN INCLUDE TERMS THAT UNDER STATE LAW ALL RIGHT THE FALSE OR MISLEADING OR INACCURATE WITH NO STATE OR FEDERAL AGENCY CHARGED WITH PROVIDING AFFORDABLE GAS WORKERS WITH CORRECT INFORMATION. IN FACT IN RECENT AND ROUGHLY 50% OF THE NEARLY THREE HUNDRED JOB OFFERS WE REVIEWED IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY EMPLOYERS FALSELY STATED THAT RESIDING IN EMPLOYER HOUSING CREATES NO TENANCY. BEEN MISLEADINGLY STATED THAT RIDING IN THE EMPLOYERS BOX FROM HIS HOUSING COMMITTEE NIELSEN'S VOLUNTARY IMPLYING THAT IT IS NOT COMPENSABLE BY MANY OTHER EMPLOYERS FAILED TO DISCLOSE THAT OVERTIME PAY IS REQUIRED AND OTHERS INACCURATELY STATED WHEN OVERTIME PAY APPLIES. BASED AT. AB EIGHT EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN IST PRESS SIMPLY A FARMER CORRECTIVE NO STATURE PROPOSED TO GATHER AS CHAIRMAN SAID. I OF COURSE MEAN FOR MAKING INTO A SINGLE WRITTEN NOTICE- PROVIDED TO WORKERS IN SPANISH ON THEIR FIRST DAY OF RUSSIA BUT NAY BRIEFLY ADDRESSED THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE FOR S. B. ELEVEN OH TWO MINING. WHICH IS BILL CLOSELY TRACKS FIRST THE GOVERNOR STOPOVERS BUT HE SUPPORTED THE POLICY OF S. B. ELEVEN OH TWO BUT HE FELT THAT IT GENERALLY DIDN'T GIVE THE AGENCY SUFFICIENT AUTHORITY RIGHT JUST LANGUAGE OF THE NOTICE TO ADDRESS NEW OF APPEAL LOG. PART OF ELEMENTS IN CASE ROSS AS THE BILL IN OUR LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE STATES- WE ADDRESS ALL OF THOSE ISSUES SECOND. ALTHOUGH THE VETO MESSAGE DIRECTED THE LABOR AGENCY FOR THE BALLOT BUT NOTICE CONSISTENT WITH THIS BILL I'M GONNA KILL THE GOVERNOR LACKS THE LEGAL AUTHORITY IN A VETO MESSAGE TO MANDATE THAT THE NOTICE BE DISTRIBUTED BY EACH EMPLOYER. EVERY H. TWO A. FARMWORKER THE DISTRIBUTION OF THAT NOTICE IF IT IS EVER DEVELOPED. IT'S ENTIRELY VOLUNTARY ONLY EIGHTY FIVE SEVEN RIDE YES B. ELEVEN OH TWO. REQUIRES A BIT FROM PEOPLE INTO THE OF EVERY. AND WE WERE. ASK THREE I. BOATS NAY. THANK MR SACK- SINCERO ARE YOU TO TESTIFY. AS LEADOFF LEAD SOME WITNESS. I YES I AM GOOD MR CARE MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS CYNTHIA RIGHT I'M A DIRECTOR OF LITIGATION FOR CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE WE REPRESENT HAVE RECOVERED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR H. TWO A. WORKERS. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN DOES NOT CHANGE THE CASE ON DEFINITION OF COMPENSABLE TRAVEL TIME FOR H. TWO A. WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA ALL TIME SPENT UNDER THE CONTROL OF AN EMPLOYER MUST BE COMPENSATED. IN COURT IN REALLY AND MAKE CLEAR THAT EXTENDS TO TRAVEL TIME. IN CASE OF LIKE THOSE REFERENCED IN THE COMMITTEE REPORT S. CHELSEA AND ALKON CAR. REJECTED THE NOTION THAT IS A QUESTION OF WHETHER THAT TIME IS CHARACTERIZED AS MANDATORY OR VOLUNTARY. RECOGNIZED BUT IN AT LEAST THREE CHOICE IS NO CHOICE AT ALL. AND THAT COMPENSABLE WITTY TURNS ON WHETHER THE EMPLOYER CONTROLS WHEN WHERE AND HOW THE EMPLOYEE GETS TO WORK. H. TWO A. WORKERS ARE BROUGHT INTO THIS COUNTRY BY THEIR EMPLOYERS AND ARE ASSIGNED TO SPECIFIC HOUSING SITE THEY HAVE NO CARS NO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION IS AVAILABLE. AND THEIR ACCESS TO OTHERS WITH LIMITED. EMPLOYERS CONTROL THEIR AGE TO A CRUISE BY TELLING THEM WHEN AND WHERE TO REPORT NOT TO A FIELD OF WORK LOCATION BUT FOR BUSTER VAN. RIVERSIDE BAND TAKEN TO THE WORK SITE SOMETIMES AN HOUR AWAY. AFTER THE FIELD WORK ENDS WORKERS WAIT AGAIN FOR THE EMPLOYER TO SEND THE BUS TO COME AND PICK THEM UP AND TAKE THEM BACK. THEY ARE UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE EMPLOYER DURING THIS ENTITLED TIME ENTIRE TIME AND ARE ENTITLED TO BE PAID FOR THAT TIME. THEY'RE PAID AT THE REGULAR RATE OF PAY WHICH FOR H. TWO A. WORKERS ACCORDING TO FEDERAL H TWO A. LAW. IS THE ADVERSE EFFECT WAGE RATE. A HIGHER RATE OF PAY SET SPECIFICALLY TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT A FINANCIAL INCENTIVE TO REPLACE US WORKERS. WITH H. TWO A. FOREIGN WORKERS. THE OPPONENTS OF THE BILL SEIZE UPON THE FOLLOWING TERRY LANGUAGE OF MOORLAND BUT IGNORE ITS ANALYSIS AND THE TWENTY YEARS OF KESA APPLYING IT TO A BALL SITUATIONS. THEY DO SO TO PROTECT EMPLOYERS WHO CURRENTLY IN THEIR CONTRACT LANGUAGE AND ON PLACARDS AND THEIR BUSES. PRESENT AN ILLUSORY CHOICE BY STATING THAT TRANSPORTATION IS VOLUNTARY WHEN NO REAL ALTERNATIVES EXIST FOR THESE WORKERS. CURRENTLY AND UNDER PROPOSED SECTION TWENTY EIGHT TEN POINT FIFTY FIVE OF THE BILL H. TWO A. WORKERS WHO HAVE TRUE ALTERNATIVES TO GET TO WORK AND ARE NOT REQUIRED TO TAKE THE BUS. ARE NOT ENTITLED TO COMPENSATION JUST AS THEY ARE NOT UNDER CURRENT LAW. AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN MERELY ENSURES THAT WORKERS ARE ADVISED OF THESE AND OTHER WELL ESTABLISHED RIGHTS AND DESERVES YOUR EYEBALLS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU ARE MOVING NOW TO WITNESSES SO- MAYBE HERE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM WAS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB FIFTY SEVEN. TWENTY ONE HERE WISHES THIS SPEAKER TESTIFIED ON BEHALF OF THE BILL- SEEN NONE WILL MOVE TO THE OVERFLOW ROOM- WE DO NOT HAVE WITNESSES THEY'RE WAITING TO SPEAK US WILL GO TO THE MODERATOR NASA MODERATOR. AT THE POLICE QUEUE UP ANYONE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. THE END UP PLEASE LET US KNOW HOW MANY YOU HAVE IN THE QUEUE. THANK YOU MISTER TURNER AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN YOU MAY PRESS ONE AND THEN GENERAL AT THIS TIME. CURRENTLY WE HAVE ONE PARTY IN THE QUEUE. OUR WITH ONE OTHER TWENTY ONE THIRTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATT BOBBY AFTER THE CALIFORNIA TEAMSTERS AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU- WE'RE GOING TO NOTE MOVED TO OPPOSITION. IT OPPOSITION WITNESSES- UNDERSTAND THAT TO BE MATTHEW ALLEN IN BRIAN LITTLE- MISTER ALAN ARE YOU AVAILABLE. GOOD AFTERNOON MR GERM AVAILABLE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PROCEED WE CAN REFINE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE I MATTHEW ALLEN WITH WESTERN GROWERS ASSOCIATION AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSED TO EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN- SINCE IT'S FAR MORE THAN A STRAIGHTFORWARD NOTIFICATION BILL- OUR FOCUS SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE OF- TRAVEL TIME- THE BILL CHANGES A LOT ON TRAVEL TIME TO CREATE THE NEW RIGHT THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE LONG STANDING ESTABLISH JUDICIAL PRECEDENT- THE BILL FALSELY STATE THAT IS DECLARATORY THE EXISTING LAW. WHEN IN REALITY THE BILL- IS CHANGING A LOT ABOUT EXPANDING DEFINITION OF VOLUNTARY AND MANDATORY APPLE TIME. AS THE CITED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN BRILLIANT VERSUS ROPE ASKING IN TWO THOUSAND. BY DOING SO AB EIGHT EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN ADD NEW SITUATIONS WHERE BY TRAVEL TIME WOULD BE REQUIRED TO BE PAID TO THE H. AWAY EMPLOYEE. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL GOES WELL BEYOND EXISTING COURT DECISIONS BY REQUIRING THAT THE TRAVEL TIME BE PAID AT THE REGULAR RATE OF PAY. IS NOT UNNOTICED VISITING RIGHTS SINCE CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THAT TRAVEL TIME DEBATE COMPLICATED AT NO LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. FINALLY AS REGARDS THE- GOVERNOR NEWSOM VETO. THE BILL- DOES SIGNIFICANTLY MAYOR S. B. ELEVEN OH TWO FROM LAST YEAR THAT WAS VETOED. I INTERVIEWED A MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN. THE EMPLOYEE NOTIFICATION TEMPLATE THAT WAS CONTEMPLATED UNDER ELEVEN OH TWO- SINCE THAT AS THAT PROCESS THAT CAN BE MORE READILY- TAKEN CONSIDERATION CHANGES AND EACH TO A GOVERNING LAW. AND ANY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT THE GOVERNOR'S DIRECTION OUTLINED IN THE BE THE MESSAGE. SHOULD PROCEED AFFORD WITHOUT THE INTERFERENCE OF EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY COMMENT TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU A BRIAN LITTLE- HE WOULD BE NEXT IF YOU'RE AVAILABLE. KAREN CAN YOU HEAR ME YES PLEASE PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN- AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M BRING A LITTLE REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU WE OPPOSE AB FIFTY SEVEN BECAUSE IT MAKES UNNECESSARY AND COSTLY CHANGES IN THE LAW THAT WILL APPLY TO AGRICULTURAL EMPLOYERS WHO TURNED TO THE H. TWO A. TEMPORARY VISA PROGRAM TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT NUMBERS OF EMPLOYEES TO OPERATE THEIR FARMS. AB EIGHT FIVE SEVEN CREATES A RIGHT THAT DOES NOT EXIST IN CURRENT LAW AND COMPOUNDS THE PROBLEM BY REQUIRING EMPLOYERS TO NOTIFY EMPLOYEES OF THIS NONEXISTENT RIGHT WELL AB FIFTY SEVEN FALSELY STATES THAT IT IS TO CLEAR TORRENT EXISTING LAW IT ACTUALLY CHANGES THE LAW BY EXPANDING THE DEFINITION. OF ONTARIAN MANDATED TRAVEL TIME BOTH OF WHICH WERE DEFINED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT OR MORRELL PACKING IN TWO THOUSAND. IF AB FIFTY SEVEN AS NEW SITUATIONS WHEREBY TRAVEL TIME BE REQUIRED TO BE PAID BY H. TWO EMPLOYEES. FIFTY SEVEN GOES WELL BEYOND REAL PACKING BY REQUIRING THE TRAVEL TIME BETWEEN AT THE REGULAR RATE OF PAY. THIS IS ANOTHER INSTANCE WHERE AB FIFTY SEVEN IS NOT CLEAR TO THE EXISTING LAW. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES TO TRAVEL TIME TO COMPENSATE AT NO LESS THAN THE PPLICABLE MINIMUM WAGE. AB FIFTY SEVEN REQUIRES CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS TO FURNISH ANOTHER DISCLOSURE TO THE RICH TO A EMPLOYEES OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. THIS ADDITIONAL NOTICES REDUNDANT AND UNNECESSARY BECAUSE H. TWO EMPLOYEES ENJOY THE SAME RIGHTS PROTECTIONS UNDER STATE FEDERAL LAWS TO MEXICAN POLICE. FEDERAL H. TWO A. PROGRAM WAS REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE H. TWO EMPLOYEES OF THE WRITTEN COPY THE RICH TO A CONTRACT IN THEIR NATIVE LANGUAGE BY THE FIRST DAY OF WORK. INCLUDING INFORMATION ABOUT READY TO PAY BUT IT'S CALCULATING PAY AND ALLOWANCES CLAIMED AS PART OF THE MINIMUM WAGE INCLUDING MEAL ALLOWANCES. FOR THE MORE THE SPECIFIED INFORMATION THAT WAS PROVIDED AND THE LAWS ARE REQUIRED TO BE PROVIDED. TO EACH TO EMPLOYEES UNDER THE LAW. EIGHTEEN FIFTY SEVEN THE SYSTEM. SOME TO ASK ELEVEN A TWO FORMER SENATOR BILL MINING FOR LAST YEAR. WHICH IS VETOED BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM. IN VETO MESSAGE THE GOVERNOR DIRECTED CALIFORNIA LABOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGENCY TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN. EMPLOYEE NOTIFICATION TEMPLECOMBE COMPLETED EIGHTY EIGHT FIFTY SEVEN. SINCE IT IS A PROCESS THAT CAN BE MORE READILY TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION CHANGES IN H. TO A GOVERNING LAW. AND ANY FUTURE COURT DECISIONS. AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AGENCY TO IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S INSTRUCTIONS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WE'RE GOING TO.

HE AND- SENATOR LAYERED. I HAD A QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR CAN I ARE TOTALLY UNDERSTAND. OR WHAT THIS BILL WAS IS TRYING TO ADDRESS AND- MATT IS THE THING I WAS TRYING TO UNDERSTAND BETWEEN THE DIFFERENT WITNESSES. IS IT MY PREDECESSOR DID VERY SIMILAR BILL LAST YEAR THAT WAS VETOED. AND THE GOVERNOR HAD CERTAIN EXPRESS THINGS HE SAID ABOUT VETOING I'D LIKE TO KNOW WHAT THE STATUS IS OF HIS OWN ADMINISTRATION DOING WHAT HE SAID IN A VETO MESSAGE CAN COME OF ALL WE HEARD IT FROM ONE OF THE WITNESSES SAID THE CURIOUS TO HEAR FROM YOU HOW YOU THINK THIS BILL IS DIFFERENT AND HOW IT ADDRESSES THE VETO MESSAGE SO THAT. YOUR FEELING BETTER ABOUT ITS PROSPECTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CENTER THERE- IF WE DON'T WORK WITH ADMINISTRATION ON THIS BILL THE TRUSTED A NUMBER OF AREAS I THINK THE MOST CRITICAL ONE IS GIVEN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER MORE DISCRETION TO CHANGE OR UPDATE THE MODEL NOTICE AND I CAN UNDERSTAND FROM THE GOVERNOR'S PERSPECTIVE- WHY WOULD BE AN ISSUE- TO NOT GET THAT KIND OF DISCRETION. AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL COMPONENTS IN ADDITION TO WORKING ON THE- THE CLARITY IN THE GUIDANCE THAT WOULD BE GIVEN AS TO WHAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED COMPENSABLE- TRAVEL TIME AND NOT A COULD NOT ALSO KEY COMPONENT IS THAT TO SAY. TRANSLATIONS BONTA REVERSES MANDATED WOLF HOW DO YOU DEFINE THAT AND SO CERTAINLY WORKING MORE CLOSELY WITH THE ADMINISTRATION IN TERMS OF- THAT KIND OF CLARITY- TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT THAT THAT THAT THE WEEKLY CASTANET APPROPRIATELY OVER THOSE WORKERS THAT TRULY ARE- TAKING MANDATED A TRANSPORTATION FOR ALL PRACTICAL PURPOSES. AND IS HE DOING IS THIS ADMINISTRATION DOING THAT TEMPLATE THAT HE SUGGESTED IN THE VETO MESSAGE WE'RE WORKING WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ON. THAT INCLUDING SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS AS WELL. SO THIS BILL MY BE IN ALL. AND OF A WAY TO REACH TO THE- YES- ABSOLUTELY I THINK THAT WE HAVEN'T RECEIVED- A SENSE THAT- THE- WE HAVE RECEIVED AS SENSORS EITHER OR IN FACT THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE THE GUIDANCE NEEDED MESSAGE WAS LAST SEPTEMBER. AND WE'RE IN JUNE OF THE NEXT YEAR AND THE TEMPLATE HASN'T BEEN DONE THAT'S CORRECT THAT IN SORT OF. DEFAULTS TO YOUR BILL PRESS FORCING THE ISSUE. ABSOLUTELY AND I THINK THAT IT BUT IT'S NOT LIKE YOU KNOW IT IS STILL VERY COLLABORATIVE PROCESS PUTTING THIS BILL IS PROVIDING THAT VEHICLE- THAT OTHERWISE YOU KNOW IT TOO IT WOULD NECESSARILY OCCURRENCE I THINK THAT. GIVEN THE FACT THAT- SUBSEQUENT TO THE VETO- THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO COMMUTE IS MOVING FORWARD UNDER NEW VEHICLE- OF THAT WE DID HAVE A VERY POSITIVE CONVERSATIONS GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION BUT TO YOUR POINT I WOULDN'T ANTICIPATE. THAT MOVEMENT WOULD OCCUR ABSENT THE BILL. I NOT A AND MISSED CHAIR JUST MAKE A COMMENT. I THINK THAT EXCHANGE MAKES THE CASE FOR THE BILL HERE TODAY OF MY NORMAL WEIGHT THE LATER IT GETS INTO SESSION THE MORE I GET IRRITATED ABOUT WORKS IN PROGRESS AND WE HAD ONE ON THE- SENATE FLOOR LAST WEEK FOR A LONG TIME- AND IT AND YET I THINK THIS IS A GENUINE CASE THAT. SORT OF MAKES THE CASE FOR THAT BECAUSE YOU ARE TRYING TO WORK THIS OUT SO. I THINK THAT'S- GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY WE SUPPORT THE WORKING OUT PART OF THIS AND ALL BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL WHEN WE GET TO THAT. MOMENT THANK YOU- OTHER COMMENTS CONCERNS QUESTIONS CENTERED RUSSELL. THANK YOU THANK THE AUTHOR VERY MUCH IN I THANK THE- SENATOR FROM ARE YOU MONTEREY OR SANTA CRUZ. EITHER ONE OKAY THE MODERATE- AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION- THERE'S A NUMBER OF ISSUES ONE IS. SOME OF THE LEGAL ISSUES THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE AND I WAS REALLY GLAD TO SEE THE EXCHANGE AND THAT YOU HELPING CLARIFY THAT THAT PIECE. AND THEN THERE'S THE PIECE OF HOW IT IS THAT THESE WORKERS ARE TREATED THAT WOULD PUSH US IN THE DIRECTION OF HAVING TO COME UP WITH ARE WE GIVEN THE KIND OF GIVING THEM THE KIND OF NOTICE AND INFORMATION THAT THEY SHOULD HAVE. A AND THAT'S BEEN I MEAN THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS I THINK- AND- HAVING WHEN HE YOU KNOW MAKING THAT CLEAR OVER THE YEARS IT'S OVER AND OVER IF SUCH RESISTANCE THAT THESE WORKERS WHO COME IN FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY SERIOUSLY DO YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE TO BE ABLE TO REPORT THIS OR THAT OR ASK QUESTIONS THEY HAVE TO BE GIVEN THAT TO THEM IN THE WAY THAT. THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY'LL BE COMPLETELY PROTECTED FROM THAT AND THE ISSUE OF THE TRANSPORTATION I REMEMBER AND THIS IS MANY MANY YEARS AGO THE DIFFERENCES AMONGST US EVERY WORK ON THE FIELD BETWEEN THOSE WHO WERE HERE AND THOSE WHO ARE BEING OR BEING BROUGHT IN FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY THE DIFFERENCES IN THE WAY THEY WERE WE WERE TREATED- AND ESPECIALLY ON THE ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION BECAUSE HIS DON'T GO TO THE CORNER AND SAM TO TAKE YOU KNOW NUMBER TWENTY EIGHT DOWN THE THIS FIELDER THIS ORCHARD. I MEAN YOU'RE COMPLETELY COMPLETELY AT THE DISPOSAL OF WHEN WHERE HOW ALL OF THAT IS DONE- BY THE EMPLOYER SO- THERE'S BOTH THE PRACTICAL SIDE- AND THE MORAL SIDE AND THEN THERE'S OF COURSE THE LEGAL ISSUES THAT YOU HAVE TO ADDRESS SO. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. BRINGING THIS FORWARD FOR ON SO MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF WORKERS. OKAY ANYTHING ELSE MEMBERS SERVE MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE. I'M SEEN NONE- ASSEMBLY MEMBER YOU'RE WALKING CLOSE IF YOU LIKE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN APPRECIATE THE CALL TO QUESTIONS REGARDING THAT THE GOVERNOR'S ADMINISTRATION AND- TO FOLLOW UP ON OUR- SENATORS ARE SO WHO.

OF OF THE GROWERS IN A ON THE AUTOPLAY PARKING FACILITIES PEOPLE COME AND GO ON THEIR TIME IN THEIR SCHEDULE AND THAT'S FINE- BUT LET'S NOT CALL VOLUNTARY BUT THIS IS NOT LIKE- SPEAKING OF SILICON VALLEY WITH A CHAIR AND I HELD FROM. THE GOOGLE AND APPLE EMPLOYEE LIVING IN SAN FRANCISCO HAVING A CHOICE TO DRIVE TAKE CALTRAIN OR OR TAKE THE COMPANY OF A BUS. TO THE TO WORK- IT'S OF IT'S A QUITE TO THE CONTRARY THE ONLY VOLUNTARY ASPECT OF THIS THEY CAN CHOOSE TO GO ON THE BUS AND GO TO WORK FOR THE COUNTRY'S TEN OUT OF A JOB. AND SO THE REALITY IS THAT THIS IS. REALLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE- RELEASED UP. NOT JUST NOTICE- BUT COMPANY. AND MANNER THAT ACTUAL. WHAT'S HAPPENING IN REAL WORLD.

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MODERATOR- WE'RE GONNA COME BACK NOW TO THE COMMITTEE HAVING CONCLUDED ALL TESTIMONY ON THE ITEM- ANYONE ON THE COMMITTEE WISHES TO SPEAK MEDAVOY SURE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- I DO HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON A V. SIX- SIX SIXTEEN THE IKE TO SHARE WITH OUR MEMBERS. THE SENATE HAS MADE OUR UTMOST PRIORITY THIS YEAR TO PROTECT THE INTEGRITY OF OUR CONSTITUENTS TO MAKE DECISIONS FOR THEMSELVES. AND TO MITIGATE WHAT MAY BE PERCEIVED AS COERCION INTIMIDATION OR HARASSMENT DURING VOTING PROCESSES AND VACCINATIONS. I'VE BEEN PART OF THAT. REMOVING THE ABILITY TO BE ANONYMOUS FROM ANY VOTING PROCESS WOULD ALLOW FOR UNDUE INFLUENCE BY PARTIAL PARTIES AND THEY WOULD COMPLETELY STRIP EMPLOYEES OF THEIR RIGHT TO A SAFE SPACE. TO EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO VOTE OR NOT TO VOTE. IT IS ALSO CRITICAL THAT WE PROTECT EMPLOYEES RIGHTS TO PRIVACY. I'M URGING MY COLLEAGUES TODAY TO CONTINUE WHAT WHICH WOULD WITH WHAT WE HAVE DONE THUS FAR ENJOINING CONTINUE TO UPHOLD HARD WORKINGS CALIFORNIANS RIGHTS TO PRIVACY SAFETY AND AN ELECTION PROCESS THAT IS ROOTED IN INTEGRITY. FOR THESE REASONS I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER LAYERED. HI THANK YOU MATT MISTER CHAIR APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY. AND I THINK THAT TO OUR- THE AUTHOR WAS PROBABLY GOING TO ADDRESS ALL THIS IN THE CLOTHES BUT IT KEEPS COMING UP AND SO MAYBE WE SHOULD GET RIGHT AT IT NOW BECAUSE- I READ THIS SIMPLY AND IN CONVERSATIONS UNDERSTOOD THE SIMPLY. THE DISTRICTS IN EXISTING PROCESS AND JUST ALLOWED TO BE DONE REMOTELY AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT EVERYBODY'S DRAWING CONCLUSIONS AND TO WHAT THAT MEANS AND THAT SOMEHOW THERE ISN'T A RIGHT TO PRIVACY OR THERE ISN'T ARE CONFIDENT. I WONDER IF YOU COULD JUST SPEAK DIRECTLY TO IT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S THE HEART OF THE TESTIMONY. THAT WE RECEIVED. THIS SALUTE PLEASE HAVE HOW MORE PRIVATE. AND PROTECTED CAN IT BE IF YOU CAN TAKE A BALLOT HOME. FILL IT OUT IN PRIVATE DO IT YOUR WAY AND THEN DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GOING TO MAIL IT BACK AND NO ONE KNOWS WHETHER NOT YOU MAIL IT BACK NO ONE KNOWS WHAT YOU DO WITH THAT BALLOT THAT IS THE ULTIMATE. IN PRIVACY- OF FARMWORKER NOW CAN GO TO THE POLLING PLACE. A LOT ABOUT. IN THE EXISTING PROCESS CAN TAKE IT WITH THEM. DECIDE LATER WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE GOING TO MAIL IT IN. THAT'S ALL THIS BILL IS SO THIS SPECTER OF BOOK OF LACK OF SECRECY LACK OF A SECRET BALLOT. IS RHETORIC. AND SIMPLY NOT TRUE. THERE'S NOTHING MORE PROTECTIVE OF SOMEONE'S RIGHTS. SECRET BALLOTS PRIVACY AND TO BE ABLE TO TAKE A BALLOT HOME. PHILADELPHIA DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO MAIL IT IN. AND AS YOU KNOW IN THESE KINDS OF ELECTIONS WHAT'S REQUIRED IS A NUMBER OF YES VOTES ESSENTIALLY JUST LIKE HERE. WE HAVE THIS HABIT OF STAYING OFF OF A- BUT IT'S STILL EARLY WE STILL NEED TWENTY ONE VOTES HERE. FORTY ONE IN THE ASSEMBLY TO PASS A BILL IF YOU DON'T VOTE IT DOESN'T CAP SAME THING HERE. YOU DON'T MAIL IT IN. IT DOESN'T COUNT. SO THE PRIVACY THE SECRECY. IS PROTECTED I WOULD ARGUE EVEN STRONGER IN THIS CASE. BECAUSE THE FARMWORKER DOESN'T HAVE TO GO INTO POLLING PLACE. WHICH IS AT A GROWER FACILITY. WHICH IS IT IS IT OFFICIAL LOCATION THEY CAN PICK UP THE BALLOT TAKE IT HOME PUT IT IN AN ENVELOPE PROVIDED BY. THE LABOR SECRETARY AND GOES TO THE LABOR SECRETARY WHO'S OBLIGATED. BY THE- TAYLOR BE SORRY THE AGRICULTURAL LABOR RELATIONS BOARD IT WAS OBLIGATED TO MAINTAIN THE PRIVACY IN THE SECRECY OF THAT BALANCE. SO IT IS A IN FACT A SECRET BALLOT. IN A PROCESS THAT IS MEANT TO FACILITATE THE ABILITY OF FARMWORKERS TO MAKE DECISIONS ON THEIR OWN OUTSIDE OF OUTSIDE PRESSURES. VOTE AT A PLACE OF THEIR CHOOSING. AND JUST MAIL IT IN IT WORKS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS WHY WE HAD WE CHECKED THIS WITH. THEN SECRETARY OF STATE ALEX BETWEEN. THE DOES THIS WORK. AS A SAFE AND LEGAL VOTING MECHANISM ANY SAID YES IT DOES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. WHEN IT WAS INTRODUCED WHILE HE WAS THE SECRETARY OF STATE SO STILL SICK ABOUT. AND IT IS IN IMPROVE PROCESS FOR FARMWORKERS TO BE ABLE TO TRULY MAKE AN ELECTION. THANK YOU. DECEMBER CENTER WHERE DIGITAL FOR. YOU KNOW ONE OF THE DANGERS IN THIS BUSINESSES IF YOU ASK SOMEBODY TO CHARACTERIZE THE MOTIVES ARE STATEMENTS OF OTHERS AND HOW THEY GOT THERE BUT I THINK YOU WERE JUST VERY CLEAR. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THAT'S AT THE HEART OF THIS ARE. THE ONE I FIRST AGREED CO AUTHOR OF THIS IT SEEMS SIMPLE TO ME AND I'VE BEEN SURPRISED BY THE PUSHBACK AND I THINK YOU JUST SAID. UP VERY CLEARLY AND I TAKE THAT AT ITS WORD I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE'S- A MARK INCREASED ABILITY FOR COERCION OR OTHER THINGS THANK YOU FOR YOUR APARTMENT. OKAY OTHER- QUESTIONS DRAWS OF. OUR ARE I JUST A COUPLE OF THINGS- ARTICULATIONS ALWAYS GO FLYING AROUND WHEN IT COMES TO. SOMEBODY'S RIGHT TO VOTE WE SEE IT HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY HERE- WHAT WILL INCREASE THE ABILITY OF MORE. PEOPLE TO VOTE AND FOR WILL DECREASE THE ABILITY OF PEOPLE TO GO VOTE. I JUST WANT TO ASK YOU YOU COULD EXPLAIN WITH ALL THESE ACCUSATIONS THAT SOMEHOW THERE'S GOING TO BE- VIOLATIONS OF YOU KNOW THE WORKERS RIGHTS AND- COERCION. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS- DOES ANY OF THE PROCESS WITH REGARDS TO HOW YOU HANDLE THOSE KINDS OF ACCUSATIONS DOES THAT CHANGE AS A RESULT OF THIS BILL OR MAYBE YOU CAN TALK ABOUT THAT A LITTLE BIT. HI I HAVE A HARD TIME ANSWERING FOR SOMETHING I DON'T UNDERSTAND AND I DON'T SEE IN THIS BILL. CORES IN AS LONG BEEN A CHALLENGE IN UNION ELECTIONS AND THAT PRESSURE COMES FROM BOTH SIDES. AND THE REASON THAT WE SET UP THE VOTING PROCEDURES WE HAVE IS TO ALLOW FARMWORKERS TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS. AT THE TIME OF THE ELECTION. ALL WE'RE DOING HERE IS GIVING THEM THE ABILITY TO FILL OUT THAT BALLOT. AND MAIL IT IN ON THEIR OWN TIME IN THEIR OWN WAY UNDER THEIR OWN CONTROL. THAT'S SUPPORT THIS BILL. WHAT I JUST WANT TO ADD ON HAVING BEEN THROUGH MANY MANY UNION- WITH WORKPLACE ELECTIONS- THE IDEA OF BEING ABLE TO VOTE IN THE PRIVACY OF YOUR HOME- IS QUITE EXTRAORDINARY AND I THINK BEGINS TO BALANCE YOU TALK ABOUT THE POWER OF COERCION IT'S NOT A CO WORKERS THAT COURT CHORUS ME- IT'S WHO HAS THE POWER TO FIRE ME OR WHO HAS THE POWER TO. TAKE OTHER ACTIONS AGAINST ME THAT'S REAL POWER OF COERCION- BUT- HAVE YOU BEEN THROUGH MANY MANY HUNDREDS OF WORKPLACE ELECTIONS- BEING ABLE TO FILL OUT YOUR BALLOT AT HOME- TAKE YOUR TIME. NOBODY'S THERE OR IF YOU WANT SOMEBODY TERE IF YOU DON'T WANT WHATEVER YOU WANT IT'S AND YOU ARE IN CONTROL OF YOUR HOME. WHICH IS REALLY DIFFERENT FROM HAVING TO WALK INTO THE WORKPLACE. FOR THE MANAGEMENT EMPLOYER ARE ALL THERE- THAT THAT'S A VERY SCARY SITUATION FOR MANY WORKERS SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SENATORS WILL GO BACK TO PROVIDE SURE. I DO SO FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES- HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT. THAT THERE COULD BE REPRESENTATIVES THAT ARE ALLOWED TO FILL OUT THE BALLOT AND DELIVER IT TO- TO A WORKER. AND BE ABLE TO RETRIEVE IT AND TAKE IT OR TURN IT BACK IN IS NOT PART OF THIS IS THIS BILL NO. INTEREST STILL FARMWORKERS CAN GO TO A POLLING PLACE WHICH IS AGAIN AT THE PLACE OF EMPLOYMENT. AND THEY CAN CAST A VOTE THEIR- CURRENT PROCEDURE. WHERE THEY CAN TAKE A BALLOT. THEY DON'T HAVE TO TAKE A FILLED OUT BALLOT THEY CAN FILL OUT THE BALLOT THEY CAN TAKE IT HOME. WITH AN ENVELOPE. THAT IS PROVIDED BY. THE LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WITHIN FISH LEVEL. THIS IS STILL OVERSEEING BY THE BOARD. THEY CAN TAKE IT HOME THEY CAN FILL IT OUT IF THEY NEED ASSISTANCE IN FILLING IT OUT. BECAUSE THEIR LANGUAGE CHALLENGES WHICH WE HAVE. WITHIN FARMWORKERS COMMUNITIES QUITE OFTEN. THEY CAN SEEK ASSISTANCE. AND WE WANTED TO KNOW WHO HAS ASSISTED THEM. SO THERE COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH ONE PERSON WHETHER IT'S EMPLOYER OR OTHERS. ASSISTING A LITTLE BIT TOO MUCH THAT WOULD BECOME APPARENT HERE BUT THAT'S FOR THE LABOR DETAILER BE TO FIGURE OUT BECAUSE THE FORMER CRITICS AT HOME FILLS. THEY MAY GET SOME ASSISTANCEAGAIN FILLING IT OUT FINE AS WE DO I'M SURE WE ALL HELP OUR FRIENDS AND FAMILY FILL OUT. BALLOTS BECAUSE THEY CAN BE COMPLICATED BUT THEY HAVE TO SIGN IT AND THEY HAVE TO RETURN. THEY MAIL IT BACK SO THEY'RE IN CONTROL OF THAT BALANCE. I DON'T HAVE TO MAIL IT BACK IF THEY FEEL THAT THEY'RE BEING PRESSURED. UNDULY BY ANY OF THE PARTIES. THEY DON'T HAVE TO MAIL IT BACK AND NO ONE WILL EVER KNOW. HOW MORE SECRETS THAT HOW MORE PRIVATE IS THAT THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS THEN. IS AYLER B. WHO COLLECTED TALLIES IT HOLDS THEM SECRET. AS THEY DO WITH ANY OTHER ELECTION. AND THEN THE RESULTS WITH INTEL. THANK YOU SIR THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL PROVIDES COMMERCENTRE SORRY JUST OF. ASSEMBLY MEMBER STANDING Q. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE. THE SOME MEMBERS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS- I'M A PROUD TO BE ONE OF THE PRINCIPAL COAUTHORS ON THE BILL- THE PART OF THAT IN THAT HASN'T CHANGED- THROUGHOUT THE COURSE HERE IS THE- HAVING- GROWN UP IN IN A FAMILY AND IN THE BUSINESS OF. ORCHARD FARMING AND BEING A GROWER- I AM A VISUAL PERSON AND I HATE I FEEL AS ANECDOTAL AS IT SOUNDS- THAT THE ISSUE OF A BALLOT ACCESS. IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT- FOR THE FOR THIS DEMOGRAPHIC OF WORKER AND ALWAYS HAS BEEN I THINK THE INDICES OF. OF THAT STRUGGLE THAT OF THAT CHALLENGE IN INVALID ACCESS OR PER PRETTY EVIDENT OVER THE YEARS SO WHILE I RESPECT HIM DEEPLY YOU KNOW THE CONCERNS OF GROWERS AND OTHERS AND TESTIFIED IN OPPOSITION BECAUSE- I SUPPOSE FROM A BUSINESS STANDPOINT- THEY THEY HAVE THEIR POINT OF VIEW IN. AND AND WHILE I RESPECT THAT- AGAIN I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON A PROVIDING THESE WORKERS SOME WITH THIS BILL OF THE KIND ABOUT POLITICS IS ACCESS THAT HOME. IT REALLY WE SHOULD EXPECT PEOPLE TO HELP SO THANK YOU- IT'LL. TURN TO YOU UP FOR YOUR CLOTHES.
