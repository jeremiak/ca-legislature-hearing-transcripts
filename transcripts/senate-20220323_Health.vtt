00:17:17.703 --> 00:17:19.638

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:23.609

. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE CENTER

00:17:28.981 --> 00:17:30.449
NEW INJURY THIS FORWARD I THINK

00:17:30.516 --> 00:17:32.651
OF ALL JOIN IN THE CHORUS AS- MY

00:17:32.718 --> 00:17:34.119
COLLEAGUE FROM THE CENTRAL

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:35.187
VALLEY SAID. OFTEN TIMES WHEN

00:17:35.254 --> 00:17:36.789
THE- WEATHER STARTS GETTING HOT

00:17:36.855 --> 00:17:38.891
PEOPLE GO OUT AND THAT WHEN THAT

00:17:38.957 --> 00:17:40.159
WATER STILL COMING DOWN IN OUR

00:17:40.225 --> 00:17:42.161
RIVERS. FROM THE MOUNTAINS AND

00:17:42.227 --> 00:17:43.562
IT'S ICE COLD AND PEOPLE GOING

00:17:43.629 --> 00:17:45.864
IN AND- OFTEN TIMES- TRAGIC.

00:17:45.931 --> 00:17:48.200
TRAGEDIES HAPPEN- I WOULD LOOK

00:17:48.267 --> 00:17:49.468
AT THE ACTUAL SCREENING TOOL BUT

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.403
I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I

00:17:51.470 --> 00:17:53.672
KNOW ABOUT IN MY OWN DISTRICT IS

00:17:53.739 --> 00:17:55.541
A LOT OF THE TIMES THE KIDS WHO

00:17:55.607 --> 00:17:57.409
DROWN ARE KIDS OF COLOR SO WHEN

00:17:57.476 --> 00:17:58.377
WE TALK ABOUT. EQUITY ISSUES. I

00:17:58.444 --> 00:17:59.711
THINK THIS IS INCREDIBLY

00:17:59.778 --> 00:18:00.646
IMPORTANT- WE HAVE OVER THE

00:18:00.712 --> 00:18:02.481
YEARS D. FUNDED A LOT OF OUR

00:18:02.548 --> 00:18:03.482
POOLS AND- RECREATIONAL

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:05.517
ACTIVITIES. I THINK THOSE ARE

00:18:05.584 --> 00:18:06.919
THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT WE

00:18:06.985 --> 00:18:07.886
REALLY WHEN WE'RE THINKING ABOUT

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:09.521
SOME LIKE THIS REALLY BEEF UP.

00:18:09.588 --> 00:18:11.123
THE AMOUNT OF COMMUNITY POOLS WE

00:18:11.190 --> 00:18:12.624
HAVE SWIM LESSONS FOR KIDS. I

00:18:12.691 --> 00:18:14.059
KNOW IN MY DISTRICT RIGHT WE

00:18:14.126 --> 00:18:15.561
LIVE ON THE DELTA ON THE WATER.

00:18:15.627 --> 00:18:17.463
AND THERE ARE SO MANY KIDS WHO

00:18:17.529 --> 00:18:18.831
DON'T KNOW HOW TO SWIM BECAUSE

00:18:18.897 --> 00:18:20.699
THEY DON'T HAVE ACCESS IN THEIR

00:18:20.766 --> 00:18:21.467
NEIGHBORHOOD. THEY DON'T HAVE IN

00:18:21.533 --> 00:18:23.402
THEIR BACKYARD. AND SO PEOPLE GO

00:18:23.469 --> 00:18:25.137
OUT TO LAKES AND RIVERS AND

00:18:25.204 --> 00:18:25.737
RESERVOIRS AND RIVERS WHEN IT

00:18:25.804 --> 00:18:27.739
GETS REALLY COLD. REALLY HOT-

00:18:27.806 --> 00:18:28.807
AND THEN OFTEN TRAGEDIES. IN

00:18:28.874 --> 00:18:30.509

WE'LL FIND THE- THE DATA. IS

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:40.819

PEDIATRICIAN I MYSELF HAVE SEEN

TRAGEDIES HAPPEN BUT ALSO MAKE

00:19:03.642 --> 00:19:07.513
NOTE OF THAT- THESE DROWNINGS-

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:08.981
THEY ARE PREVENTABLE IF WE

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.949
UNDERSTAND HOW THEY HAPPENED.

00:19:11.016 --> 00:19:13.218
DOES IT'S NOT ABOUT BLAME. ALL

00:19:13.285 --> 00:19:14.853
RIGHT I THINK IT'S VERY

00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.355
IMPORTANT- PARENTS ARE DOING THE

00:19:16.421 --> 00:19:18.490
BEST THEY CAN. BUT IT'S AOUT

00:19:18.557 --> 00:19:20.058
BEING SURE WE TAKE THE STEPS WE

UNDERSTAND HOW THEY HAPPENED AND

00:19:21.527 --> 00:19:23.295
TAKE THE STEPS NECESSARY TO

00:19:23.362 --> 00:19:25.597
PREVENT A FACTORY PRESET YOUR-

00:19:25.664 --> 00:19:26.932
PREVIOUS WORK IN THE LEGISLATURE

00:19:26.999 --> 00:19:31.036
TO- TO REQUIRED THAT- WE PUT IN-

00:19:31.103 --> 00:19:32.638
THE SYSTEMS IN PLACE WE PUT IN

00:19:32.704 --> 00:19:34.039
THAT WHETHER IT'S THE- VERY

00:19:34.106 --> 00:19:35.040
YOUNG THE FENCES OR WHATEVER

00:19:35.107 --> 00:19:37.409
ELSE THEY NEED TO DO TO SO THAT

00:19:37.476 --> 00:19:38.510
PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE CASE

00:19:38.577 --> 00:19:39.778
CHILD FALLS INTO A POOL OR

00:19:39.845 --> 00:19:41.480
OTHER. BODY OF WATER AND THAT

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:44.182
THAT THEY MIGHT BE AT RISK OF

00:19:44.249 --> 00:19:44.816
DROWNING. SO THIS IS ESSENTIAL

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:47.553
STEP- TO SURE WE UNDERSTAND HOW

00:19:47.619 --> 00:19:49.888
DROWNINGS HAPPENED AND THEN WE

00:19:49.955 --> 00:19:51.890
CAN TAKE THE STEPS TO HELP

00:19:51.957 --> 00:19:54.660
PREVENT THEM. SO THESE ARE NOT

00:19:54.726 --> 00:19:56.828
JUST ACCIDENTS- THESE ARE THINGS

00:19:56.895 --> 00:19:58.697

SCREEN DOES NOT TEST FOR

FENTANYL BECAUSE IT IS A

00:25:55.921 --> 00:25:57.789
SYNTHETIC OPIOID. HAD WE KNOWN

00:25:57.856 --> 00:25:58.990

PROFIT MARGIN IN HERE FOR

01:54:45.345 --> 01:54:46.813
SOMEONE. I DON'T THINK IT'S THE

01:54:46.879 --> 01:54:47.647
LOCAL COVERED ENTITY OR THE

01:54:47.714 --> 01:54:50.717
PERSON WHO'S IN THE DEAD CENTER

01:54:50.783 --> 01:54:51.818
OF LOS ANGELES SERVICING THEM.

01:54:51.884 --> 01:54:54.587
PEOPLE IN OUR SOCIETY. IT'S

01:54:54.654 --> 01:54:56.256
SOMEWHERE UP THE CHAIN AND I'M

01:54:56.322 --> 01:54:57.857
JUST TRYING TO FIGURE THAT OUT

01:54:57.924 --> 01:54:59.259
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:54:59.325 --> 01:55:01.194
MECHANISMS ARE IN PLACE. TO MAKE

01:55:01.261 --> 01:55:03.196
SURE THAT THEY CAN EARN FORTY

01:55:03.263 --> 01:55:05.832
DOLLARS DOESN'T EXIST- I THINK

01:55:05.898 --> 01:55:08.134
IT DOES EXIST. AND SO MY

01:55:08.201 --> 01:55:14.173
QUESTION IS THAT- FOR. ARE THEY

01:55:14.240 --> 01:55:15.708
COVERED ENTITY. IN SOME OF THIS

01:55:15.775 --> 01:55:17.410
MAY SOMEHOW AND THERE. THAT FOR

01:55:17.477 --> 01:55:18.678
A SERVER. FOR THE COMMUNITY THAT

01:55:18.745 --> 01:55:19.979
THEY SERVE. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

01:55:20.046 --> 01:55:21.581
OUT HOW THAT THREE NINE FORTY

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:23.816
BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT MARGIN IS

01:55:23.883 --> 01:55:24.884
IN THERE. WHEN WE'RE GIVING-

01:55:24.951 --> 01:55:27.820
DRAGS. ON THREE FORTY B. WE'RE

01:55:27.887 --> 01:55:29.722
GIVING THREE FORTY B. DRUGS AT A

01:55:29.789 --> 01:55:30.990
DISCOUNTED RATE TO LOCAL

01:55:31.057 --> 01:55:32.959
COMMUNITY SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS%

01:55:33.026 --> 01:55:35.061
OR HOSPITALS OR CLINICS. THAT

01:55:35.128 --> 01:55:35.962
ARE SERVING THE MOST VULNERABLE

01:55:36.029 --> 01:55:38.231
MERGERS AND MY SIDE OF OUR

01:55:38.298 --> 01:55:41.534
SOCIETY THAT MAKES SENSE. YEAH I

01:55:41.601 --> 01:55:44.170
MEAN I THINK JUST TO BE CLEAR SO

01:55:44.237 --> 01:55:45.138
THERE IS SOME SAVINGS THERE

01:55:45.204 --> 01:55:47.006
THAT'S GENERATED BY THE COVERED

01:55:47.073 --> 01:55:48.908
ENTITY WHEN THEY PURCHASE A DRUG

01:55:48.975 --> 01:55:50.310
AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE. THE

01:55:50.376 --> 01:55:52.211
CONTRACT PHARMACY RECEIVES A

01:55:52.278 --> 01:55:54.414
PORTION OF THAT SAVINGS POOREST

01:55:54.480 --> 01:55:56.749
DISPENSING THAT MEDICATION THOSE

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:59.385
CONTRACTS VARY DEPENDING ON THE

01:55:59.452 --> 01:56:01.354
COVERED ENTITY IN THE PHARMACY

01:56:01.421 --> 01:56:04.023
BUT THE MAJORITY OF THAT SAVINGS

01:56:04.090 --> 01:56:06.426
STAYS WITH THE COVERED ENTITY.

01:56:06.492 --> 01:56:07.960
AND THEN THEY'RE REQUIRED TO USE

01:56:08.027 --> 01:56:10.129
THAT THAT SAVINGS TO EXPAND

01:56:10.196 --> 01:56:12.498
ACCESS TO SERVICES FOR

01:56:12.565 --> 01:56:14.400
UNDERSERVED PATIENTS. OKAY SO

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:16.803
THAT MAKES SENSE TO ME AND THAT

01:56:16.869 --> 01:56:17.637
ANSWERS MY QUESTION I THINK SO

01:56:17.704 --> 01:56:19.505
FROM A COVERED ENTITY AT LOS

01:56:19.572 --> 01:56:20.807

I'M ABLE TO GET. TAKE CARE OF

01:56:27.447 --> 01:56:28.781
THE PEOPLE THAT ARE UNDERSERVED

01:56:28.848 --> 01:56:30.817
AND THEN I CAN IN TURN. USE

I'M NOT THAT I PERSONALLY AWARE

01:57:36.949 --> 01:57:38.818
OF THIS IS US THIS IS A STATE

01:57:38.885 --> 01:57:41.220
LAW SO THERE'S I THINK BELIEVED

01:57:41.287 --> 01:57:41.854
TO. HANDLE ALL THE DETAILS OF

01:57:41.921 --> 01:57:43.623
THE LAWSUITS BUT- INTENDED IT'S

01:57:43.689 --> 01:57:45.992
BASED AROUND- YOU KNOW WHO. WHO

01:57:46.058 --> 01:57:48.861
QUALIFIES AS A COVERED ENTITY AT

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:50.229
CENTER AND THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S

01:57:50.296 --> 01:57:52.365
A FEDERAL ISSUE OKAY I THINK. WE

01:57:52.432 --> 01:57:53.933
WILL THIS BILL ACTUALLY CALLS

01:57:54.000 --> 01:57:55.034
FOR WHATEVER THE FEDERAL

01:57:55.101 --> 01:57:58.104
DEFINITION IS WELL IN FORCE

01:57:58.171 --> 01:57:59.739
AGAINST. SO WHATEVER DILIP

01:57:59.806 --> 01:58:01.007
BALCOMBE THE LAWSUIT IS

01:58:01.073 --> 01:58:02.542
REGARDING WHO GETS THE FIND IT

01:58:02.608 --> 01:58:04.243
THAT'S WHAT'S BILLED BY TWO.

01:58:04.310 --> 01:58:06.279
THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR IT

01:58:06.345 --> 01:58:07.480

01:58:07.547 --> 01:58:08.915
TRY TO UNDERSTAND THE THREE TO

01:58:08.981 --> 01:58:10.416
FORTY BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE

01:58:10.483 --> 01:58:12.819
WAS. ROUGHLY THREE TO FOUR WHERE

01:58:12.885 --> 01:58:14.554
IS IT GOING. YEAH AND IF I MAY

01:58:14.620 --> 01:58:17.757
JUST MAKE A COMMENT ABOUT THAT-

01:58:17.824 --> 01:58:19.625
I MEAN- THE- AND THEY SAY THAT'S

01:58:19.692 --> 01:58:22.261
PROFITABLE AGAIN THE MONEY THAT

01:58:22.328 --> 01:58:25.131
COMES OUT OF THE FROM THE

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:26.899
DISCOUNT RATE FROM BETWEEN THAT

01:58:26.966 --> 01:58:28.768
THAT THAT THAT COVERED ENTITIES

01:58:28.835 --> 01:58:31.370
GET. BY LAW. THEY HAVE TO SPEND

01:58:31.437 --> 01:58:34.173
IT SO IT'S ME CAUGHT WE CAN CALL

01:58:34.240 --> 01:58:35.107
PROFIT BUT FIRST HONESTLY AS A

01:58:35.174 --> 01:58:36.843
NOT FOR PROFIT BUT THEY HAVE TO

01:58:36.909 --> 01:58:38.511
SPEND IT ON EXPANDING PATIENT

01:58:38.578 --> 01:58:40.513
CARE SERVICES AGAIN OFTENTIMES

01:58:40.580 --> 01:58:42.014
THEY'RE SPENDING IT ON THINGS

01:58:42.081 --> 01:58:43.749
THAT WE DON'T EXPLICITLY

01:58:43.816 --> 01:58:44.584
REIMBURSE. SO THAT'S THE

01:58:44.650 --> 01:58:46.052
CONSPIRACY THE MAIN REASON FOR

01:58:46.118 --> 01:58:48.955
THIS BILL IS TO BE SURE WE DON'T

01:58:49.021 --> 01:58:49.722

WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS SINCE

01:58:51.357 --> 01:58:51.924
NINETEEN NINETY TWO. SO I THINK

01:58:51.991 --> 01:58:53.459
THAT THAT WE DON'T WANT TO SEE

WITH YOU AND I THINK SERRA GROVE

02:02:52.665 --> 02:02:54.633
IN TERMS OF SAYING THAT WE WANT

02:02:54.700 --> 02:02:55.601
TO BE SURE THE SAVINGS SKILLS

02:02:55.668 --> 02:02:57.536
HELP PATIENTS. RIGHT I MEAN

02:02:57.603 --> 02:02:58.471
THAT'S THE PURPOSE OF THE

02:02:58.537 --> 02:02:59.939
DISCOUNT IN FACT THAT'S WHY THE

02:03:00.005 --> 02:03:02.174
LAW. ON THREE FORTY V. SAYS.

02:03:02.241 --> 02:03:03.709
THAT THE QUAKE JUST CAN'T SPIT

02:03:03.776 --> 02:03:05.745
OUT ANYTHING THAT IS THEY NEED

02:03:05.811 --> 02:03:10.416
TO. SPEND ON THINGS THAT THAT

02:03:10.483 --> 02:03:11.717
THAT SUSPICIONS. AND OF YOU KNOW

02:03:11.784 --> 02:03:13.486
POTENTIAL. AND SO FORTH ARE OUT

02:03:13.552 --> 02:03:15.621
THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN IN PLACE

02:03:15.688 --> 02:03:16.622
SINCE NINETEEN NINETY TWO RIGHT

02:03:16.689 --> 02:03:17.757
SO THERE ARE- SO- YOU CAN TELL

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:19.658
ME HOW MANY STORIES OF FRAUD AND

02:03:19.725 --> 02:03:21.594
SO FORTH I'M NOT SAYING THAT

02:03:21.660 --> 02:03:23.362
DOESN'T EXIST AT ALL BUT- YOU

02:03:23.429 --> 02:03:24.797
KNOW THE- THE AGENCY THE FEDERAL

02:03:24.864 --> 02:03:25.364
AGENCY RESPONSIBLE YOU KNOW

02:03:25.431 --> 02:03:27.066
THEY'VE BEEN MONITORING THIS

02:03:27.133 --> 02:03:29.268
PROGRAM. THEY'VE DONE AUDITS AND

02:03:29.335 --> 02:03:31.737
SO FORTH- THEN THE QUESTION IS

02:03:31.804 --> 02:03:35.007
THAT- L. WHO SHOULD BE THE ONES

02:03:35.074 --> 02:03:37.676
TO MONITOR. THE FRAUD RIGHT- SO

02:03:37.743 --> 02:03:39.044
CERTAINLY THE FEDERAL AGENCY

02:03:39.111 --> 02:03:40.646
THAT'S RESPONSIBLE THREE FORTY

02:03:40.713 --> 02:03:43.182
P. PROGRAM- IS. IS INVOLVED- THE

02:03:43.249 --> 02:03:43.849
HEALTH RESOURCE SERVICE

02:03:43.916 --> 02:03:46.986
ADMINISTRATION. THEY MONITOR

02:03:47.052 --> 02:03:48.988
DATE DO AUDITS IT'S CETERA. THE

02:03:49.054 --> 02:03:50.790
QUESTION IS THAT THERE'S A THE

02:03:50.856 --> 02:03:52.992
POINTED OUT A LITTLE EARLIER IS

02:03:53.058 --> 02:03:54.794
THAT. SO THE PBMS IN THE

02:03:54.860 --> 02:03:56.195
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES

02:03:56.262 --> 02:03:57.563
CERTAINLY ARE SO THAT YOU KNOW

02:03:57.630 --> 02:03:59.632
ARE INTERESTED IN ACTUALLY DOING

02:03:59.698 --> 02:04:00.599
THAT ROLE SO THE QUESTION IS

02:04:00.666 --> 02:04:02.835
WHY. WHAT YOUR AFTER ALL IT'S

02:04:02.902 --> 02:04:04.370
THEIR DID NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT

02:04:04.436 --> 02:04:05.805
THEY'RE NOT FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

02:04:05.871 --> 02:04:06.806
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS THE

02:04:06.872 --> 02:04:07.873
ONE WHO NEGOTIATES WITH THE

02:04:07.940 --> 02:04:09.875
PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES FOR

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:10.743
THREE FORTY DISCOUNTS ALREADY SO

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:12.378
INTERESTED. AND NOW SUDDENLY

02:04:12.444 --> 02:04:15.147
BEING THE ENFORCERS- IT JUST OUT

02:04:15.214 --> 02:04:16.682
OF THEIR OWN YOU KNOW IS IT JUST

02:04:16.749 --> 02:04:18.551
OUT OF THE GOODNESS OF THEIR

02:04:18.617 --> 02:04:20.452
HEART NOW AND MAYBE- BUT- I

02:04:20.519 --> 02:04:22.421
WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE

02:04:22.488 --> 02:04:24.089
WANT TO BE SURE THAT THERE

02:04:24.156 --> 02:04:25.291
ISN'T. THAT WE DON'T

02:04:25.357 --> 02:04:27.026
DISADVANTAGE THE PATIENTS WHO

02:04:27.092 --> 02:04:27.927
ARE IN THE THREE FORTY B.

02:04:27.993 --> 02:04:29.428
PROGRAM BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY

02:04:29.495 --> 02:04:30.429
HAVE AN AGREEMENT FEDERAL

02:04:30.496 --> 02:04:31.730
GOVERNMENT THAT THEY'RE GETTING

02:04:31.797 --> 02:04:32.631
A DISCOUNT RIGHT AND- YOU KNOW

02:04:32.698 --> 02:04:34.466
THE PBMS THEY WORK IF THEY HAVE

02:04:34.533 --> 02:04:37.870
REBATES AND SO FORTH. AND SO THE

02:04:37.937 --> 02:04:39.405
QUESTION IS THAT. YEAH I'M

02:04:39.471 --> 02:04:40.773
CERTAINLY OPEN TO AGAIN WORK

02:04:40.840 --> 02:04:42.174
WITH THE OPPOSITE. SPOKE TO

02:04:42.241 --> 02:04:43.475
SAYING WE WANTED WE STAMP OUT

02:04:43.542 --> 02:04:45.444
FRONT RIGHT WE WANT THAT MONEY

02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:46.879
TO GO- PROPERLY TO THE PATIENTS

02:04:46.946 --> 02:04:48.347
WHO NEED HELP RIGHT AND AGAIN

02:04:48.414 --> 02:04:50.182
THIS PROGAM'S BEEN AROUND FOR A

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:51.784
LONG TIME. SO WE WANNA BE SURE

02:04:51.851 --> 02:04:52.885
THAT'S WHERE THE MONEY GOES AND

02:04:52.952 --> 02:04:54.520
SO THERE'S THINGS WE CAN DO TO

02:04:54.587 --> 02:04:58.591
GET. THAT DONE ARE YOU SURE THAT

02:04:58.657 --> 02:05:00.893
THAT'S GREAT. WELL I DON'T WANT

02:05:00.960 --> 02:05:01.694
TO HAVE HAPPEN THOUGH IS WE TRY

02:05:01.760 --> 02:05:03.729
DON'T WANT TO. THEMSELVES WHO

02:05:03.796 --> 02:05:04.730
ARE THE PATIENTS OF THE COVERED

02:05:04.797 --> 02:05:05.865
ENTITY TO BE DISADVANTAGED

02:05:05.931 --> 02:05:07.566
BECAUSE- NOW WHAT'S HAPPENING IS

02:05:07.633 --> 02:05:08.467
WE HAVE ENTITIES MAY HAVE OTHER

02:05:08.534 --> 02:05:10.202
INTERESTS AS WELL. IN FINDING

02:05:10.269 --> 02:05:11.804
OUT THIS INFORMATION THAT MAY BE

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:12.638
USED TO DISADVANTAGE THEM TO

02:05:12.705 --> 02:05:14.273
MAKE THE DRUGS LESS AVAILABLE TO

02:05:14.340 --> 02:05:15.507
THEM. RIGHT BECAUSE AFTER ALL

02:05:15.574 --> 02:05:16.408
THEY'RE NOT GETTING MAKING AS

02:05:16.475 --> 02:05:18.611
MUCH MONEY ON THESE BECAUSE THEY

02:05:18.677 --> 02:05:20.579
HAVE TO GIVE A DISCOUNT. SO THE

02:05:20.646 --> 02:05:22.181
QUESTION IS WHICH AND- ARE THE

02:05:22.248 --> 02:05:23.215
BEST ENTITIES. TO ACTUALLY TRACK

02:05:23.282 --> 02:05:25.217
THE FRONT. AND SO CERTAINLY

02:05:25.284 --> 02:05:27.486
HAPPY TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION-

02:05:27.553 --> 02:05:29.588
TO SAY YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT KIND

02:05:29.655 --> 02:05:31.257
OF REPORTING NEEDS TO HAPPEN IF

02:05:31.323 --> 02:05:33.292
WE DON'T. YOU KNOW DON'T- IF YOU

02:05:33.359 --> 02:05:33.926
THINK THAT COVERED ENTITIES WHO

02:05:33.993 --> 02:05:34.793
ACTUALLY ARE LEGALLY

02:05:34.860 --> 02:05:36.128
RESPONSIBLE- DEAL THAT DID THAT

02:05:36.195 --> 02:05:37.363
THERE'S INSUFFICIENT OVERSIGHT

02:05:37.429 --> 02:05:38.530
OVER THEM OR SOMETHING LIKE

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:39.765
THAT. LET'S HAVE THAT

02:05:39.832 --> 02:05:43.602
CONVERSATION BUT I DID WANT TO

02:05:43.669 --> 02:05:45.271
ALSO BE SURE THAT. THE ENTITIES

02:05:45.337 --> 02:05:46.772
ARE DO OVERSEE THIS RIGHT SO YOU

02:05:46.839 --> 02:05:48.007
THAT THAT. THAT THIRD

02:05:48.073 --> 02:05:49.441
APPROPRIATE ENTITIES THAT ARE

02:05:49.508 --> 02:05:50.709
DOING THE OVERSIGHT AND THAT

02:05:50.776 --> 02:05:52.478
THEY DON'T HAVE OTHER INTERESTS

02:05:52.544 --> 02:05:54.813
THAT MAY CONFLICT WITH. ACCESS

02:05:54.880 --> 02:05:58.050
TO THESE MEDICATIONS. SO I DID

02:05:58.117 --> 02:05:59.251
THAT SO I THINK THAT'S- THE

02:05:59.318 --> 02:06:00.953
THAT'S THE- THAT'S- AND THEN

02:06:01.020 --> 02:06:02.554
CERTAINLY AGAIN. NOW THIS IS THE

02:06:02.621 --> 02:06:04.189
FIRST COMMITTEE- SELL PRE

02:06:04.256 --> 02:06:05.457

02:06:05.524 --> 02:06:07.059
OPPORTUNITY TO WORK. WITH THE

AGAIN. WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT IN

02:06:12.131 --> 02:06:13.399
THE REASON I DECIDE TO CARRY

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:14.767
THIS BILL WHEN THE WHEN THE

02:06:14.833 --> 02:06:16.802
SPONSORS APPROACH ME IS THAT I

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:18.570
WANT TO BE SURE. THAT WE DON'T

02:06:18.637 --> 02:06:19.838
HAVE. CUTS IN THESE SERVICES.

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:22.174
RIGHT BECAUSE AS THIS IS IT SAYS

02:06:22.241 --> 02:06:24.343
THIS THINGS MOVING ALONG. THE

02:06:24.410 --> 02:06:25.544
THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM WHICH

02:06:25.611 --> 02:06:27.546
AGAIN HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:28.914
NINETEEN NINETY TWO IS A BIT

02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:29.481
UNDER ATTACK BECAUSE WHAT

02:06:29.548 --> 02:06:30.582

UNFORTUNATELY THERE YOU KNOW

02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:38.590
THAT THAT. THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

02:06:38.657 --> 02:06:40.492
PEOPLE WHO WHO DO ARE JUST AS

02:06:40.559 --> 02:06:42.728
YOU KNOW WHO WHO ARE NOT. HIGH

02:06:42.795 --> 02:06:44.330
INCOME AND SO FORTH TO DEPEND ON

02:06:44.396 --> 02:06:46.398
THESE MEDICATIONS. AND AND ALSO

02:06:46.465 --> 02:06:48.634
AS THE IRONICALLY EVEN AS- SOME

02:06:48.701 --> 02:06:49.535
MEDICATIONS YOU KNOW NEW

BECOME. EVER MORE. TO THE TO

02:06:58.043 --> 02:07:00.846
PATIENTS WHO ARE THREE FORTY B.

02:07:00.913 --> 02:07:02.481

WITH FOLKS- BUT- I THINK WE ALL

02:07:08.020 --> 02:07:10.122
SHARE THE SAME GOAL. AND I

02:07:10.189 --> 02:07:10.990
HAVEN'T EVEN DISAGREED THAT.

02:07:11.056 --> 02:07:13.892
LET'S GO AHEAD. YEAH AND- THAT.

02:07:13.959 --> 02:07:15.494
THE SERVICES THAT THESE PATIENTS

02:07:15.561 --> 02:07:17.696
GET. DON'T GET CUT AND THAT WE

02:07:17.763 --> 02:07:19.631

MAKE THAT AVAILABLE NOW IT'S YOU

02:07:29.174 --> 02:07:30.509
KNOW ONE THING I WOULD ALSO JUST

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:32.411
SORT OF POINT OUT IS THAT. THIS

02:07:32.478 --> 02:07:34.513
IS THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT THESE

02:07:34.580 --> 02:07:36.482
OTHER SERVICES. THAT'S ALL

02:07:36.548 --> 02:07:37.082
BIGGER DISCUSSION AND I WOULD

02:07:37.149 --> 02:07:38.117
STAND ON THAT I THINK THERE'S

02:07:38.183 --> 02:07:39.818
SOME DEBATE ABOUT THAT. GOSH WE

02:07:39.885 --> 02:07:40.719
MORE EXPLICITLY FUNDED INSTEAD

OF MAKING IT IMPLICITLY FUNDED

02:07:42.454 --> 02:07:44.289

DO IT THE OTHER WAY. THAT'S THE

02:07:49.528 --> 02:07:53.465
ONLY. FOR A- DISCUSSION. WELL

02:07:53.532 --> 02:07:55.367
THAT. LET'S HAVE THIS CUT

02:07:55.434 --> 02:07:56.869

NINETEEN NINETY TWO BUT- IT. MY

02:08:37.743 --> 02:08:40.245
QUESTION. OKAY NOW THAT I THIS

02:08:40.312 --> 02:08:42.448
CASE THAT I HAD SAID RECENTLY.

02:08:42.514 --> 02:08:44.249
BUT THIS HAD DOES NOT TO DO IT

02:08:44.316 --> 02:08:46.085
CALIFORNIA HAS TO DO WITH

ARKANSAS RIGHT. AND I BELIEVE IN

02:08:47.252 --> 02:08:48.420
YOU NEED TO CORRECT ME IF I'M

02:08:48.487 --> 02:08:49.788
WRONG THAT. THEY FOUND THAT

02:08:49.855 --> 02:08:51.557
THERE IS- IT THERE'S A

02:08:51.623 --> 02:08:53.492
DISRUPTION TO THE FEDERAL THREE

I'D LIKE THAT THE RECENT RULING

02:09:03.969 --> 02:09:06.238
WHICH ISN'T A VIRUS VERSUS HAS

THE STATEMENT THAT 60% WERE SENT

02:12:01.847 --> 02:12:03.749
OUT OF STATE IS THAT. MEDITATION

02:12:03.815 --> 02:12:04.683
CENTER STATED THAT BECAUSE THE-

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:05.917
SEA WAS HEADQUARTERED OUT OF

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:07.586

I'LL JUST MOVE FORWARD CLEARLY.

02:12:21.533 --> 02:12:22.801
THERE'S A LOT OF LINGERING

02:12:22.868 --> 02:12:24.036
QUESTIONS FOR ME AGAIN NOT

BECAUSE IT IT'S A BAD BILL OR

02:12:25.704 --> 02:12:27.673
ANYTHING IT'S JUST THAT IT IS A

02:12:27.739 --> 02:12:28.907
VERY INTENSE CONVERSATION WE'VE

02:12:28.974 --> 02:12:29.908
HAD HERE AT THE TOP. I HAVE

02:12:29.975 --> 02:12:31.777
EVERY CONFIDENCE AND- SENATOR

02:12:31.843 --> 02:12:33.745

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:34.880
OPPOSITION THAT HE JUST DATE

02:12:34.946 --> 02:12:36.682
ITSELF I'LL JUST LEAVE IT AT

02:12:36.748 --> 02:12:38.750

ANOTHER. THANK YOU. AND IF YOU.

02:12:50.962 --> 02:12:53.098
AND LONG TIME I THINK ON THE

02:12:53.165 --> 02:12:55.033
POINT OF COLLECTING DATA AT ALL

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:56.902
I WILL SAY IS THAT I THINK DATA

02:12:56.968 --> 02:12:58.870
CAN BE COLLECTED TO ASSESS FRONT

02:12:58.937 --> 02:13:01.506
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT IT COULD

02:13:01.573 --> 02:13:02.908
JUST BE COLLECTED- AND IN THE

02:13:02.974 --> 02:13:04.476
ROOM AND IT'S ALSO USEFUL IS TO

02:13:04.543 --> 02:13:05.610
UNDERSTAND YOUR YOU KNOW PATIENT

02:13:05.677 --> 02:13:07.112
NEEDS AND UNDERSTAND WHERE THE

02:13:07.179 --> 02:13:08.647
TRENDS ARE AT YOU KNOW IN TERMS

02:13:08.714 --> 02:13:10.482
OF THE MEDICINES- AND SO FORTH

02:13:10.549 --> 02:13:12.784
SO I KNOW THAT THAT'S BEEN A BIG

02:13:12.851 --> 02:13:14.619
POINT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT- THE

02:13:14.686 --> 02:13:17.155
ABILITY TO. TO TRACK- AND

02:13:17.222 --> 02:13:19.725
REQUEST DATA THAT'S USED AND SO

02:13:19.791 --> 02:13:21.593
I WANT TO TAKE IT NOT JUST FROM

02:13:21.660 --> 02:13:25.430
BLENDS IT'S ONLY BECAUSE- ONCE

02:13:25.497 --> 02:13:26.698
THE TRACK FRAUD AS WELL AS

02:13:26.765 --> 02:13:30.569
BECAUSE IT TAKES. THING THE

02:13:30.635 --> 02:13:31.703
MEDICINE THE BEING USED. BUT

02:13:31.770 --> 02:13:34.506
MICHAEL. HAS TO DO WITH A THEME

02:13:34.573 --> 02:13:37.008
THAT THAT HAS COME UP SO MUCH AT

02:13:37.075 --> 02:13:38.043
TODAY WHICH IS THEABILITY TO

02:13:38.110 --> 02:13:39.845
HAVE CONTRACTS WITH PHARMACIES

02:13:39.911 --> 02:13:42.013

02:13:42.080 --> 02:13:43.515
UNIQUE YOU KNOW MULTI COUNTY

02:13:43.582 --> 02:13:46.785
VERY LARGE AND I HAVE A URBAN

02:13:46.852 --> 02:13:49.688
HUBS I HAVE RULE HUGS- AND

CERTAINLY GET ACCESS TO

02:13:52.491 --> 02:13:53.625
AFFORDABLE MEDICINES FOR THE

02:13:53.692 --> 02:13:56.161
NEEDIEST. WHICH IS WHAT THIS IS

02:13:56.228 --> 02:13:58.964
TRYING TO DO- HAS ALWAYS BEEN AN

02:13:59.030 --> 02:14:00.065
ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT TO US BUT

02:14:00.132 --> 02:14:01.933
ALSO PRESENTSQUITE A NUMBER OF

02:14:02.000 --> 02:14:04.236
COMPLICATIONS SO AS I HEARD THIS

02:14:04.302 --> 02:14:05.804
CONVERSATION ABOUT CONTRACTING

02:14:05.871 --> 02:14:07.906
WITH PHARMACIES- I THINK ABOUT

02:14:07.973 --> 02:14:10.075
THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT AND

02:14:10.142 --> 02:14:13.011
I REPRESENT ME BE ABOUT EIGHTY

02:14:13.078 --> 02:14:13.912
NINE NINETY ZIP CODES AT

02:14:13.979 --> 02:14:16.415
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. AND AT

02:14:16.481 --> 02:14:19.818
LEAST HALF OF THOSE IF NOT MORE

02:14:19.885 --> 02:14:22.020
DON'T HAVE CONTRACTS WITH

02:14:22.087 --> 02:14:24.222
PHARMACIES IN MY LOCAL COMMUNITY

02:14:24.289 --> 02:14:25.891
AND SO YOU SEE THAT YOU FOR

02:14:25.957 --> 02:14:28.527
EXAMPLE HOSPITALS MAY HAVE TO OR

02:14:28.593 --> 02:14:31.897
CHOOSE TO. CONTRACT OUT OF STATE

02:14:31.963 --> 02:14:33.732
AND NOT WITH MY LOCAL PHARMACY

02:14:33.799 --> 02:14:35.834
SO I'M NOT SURE WHO TO ASK UNTIL

02:14:35.901 --> 02:14:38.270
AND SO I'M CAN YOU RESPOND AND

02:14:38.336 --> 02:14:40.138
HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT SOME OF

02:14:40.205 --> 02:14:42.073
THE CONTRACTS WITH FAR ARE ARE

02:14:42.140 --> 02:14:44.042
GOING HELLO FOR IN. THEIR

02:14:44.109 --> 02:14:45.811
HAPPENING OUT OF STATE AND HOW

02:14:45.877 --> 02:14:47.646
DOES ONE THINK ABOUT THAT IN

02:14:47.712 --> 02:14:48.580
TERMS OF WHAT IT COULD PROVIDE

02:14:48.647 --> 02:14:50.615
WHAT IT MEANS TO THE ALTERNATE

02:14:50.682 --> 02:14:52.284
GOAL THAT I SHARE WITH YOU WHICH

02:14:52.350 --> 02:14:53.985
IS HOW TO GET AFFORDABLE.

02:14:54.052 --> 02:14:56.688
MEDICINE TO THOSE YOU KNOW WHO

02:14:56.755 --> 02:14:57.823
MOST NEED IT CAN YOU JUST

02:14:57.889 --> 02:14:59.458
COMMENT ON THAT AND HELP ME

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:01.460
THINK THROUGH AN ISSUE LIKE THAT

02:15:01.526 --> 02:15:03.862
YEAH AND AN ATTACK- BEAR FOR

02:15:03.929 --> 02:15:05.831
VALVE THE NATIONAL ANSWER AND

02:15:05.897 --> 02:15:07.032
HAVE A FOLLOW UP HERE BECAUSE

02:15:07.098 --> 02:15:09.568
I'D THINK FOR. MANY COVERED

02:15:09.634 --> 02:15:11.369
ENTITIES THEY'RE STRUGGLING WITH

02:15:11.436 --> 02:15:13.638
THE SAME ISSUE YOU ARE RIGHT IF

02:15:13.705 --> 02:15:18.577
YOUR. MANAGER IS VERY LARGE. IF

02:15:18.643 --> 02:15:20.779
YOU IN THE HOUSE. THAT MEANS I

02:15:20.846 --> 02:15:21.613
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE THEIR WAY

02:15:21.680 --> 02:15:23.381
OFF. YOU YOU'RE ONE CLINIC- OR

02:15:23.448 --> 02:15:25.050
WHATEVER IT IS TO GET TO THEIR

02:15:25.116 --> 02:15:25.650
MEDICATION THINK ABOUT REFILLS

02:15:25.717 --> 02:15:27.686
AND SO FORTHRIGHT. SO IT MAY

02:15:27.752 --> 02:15:29.154
MAKE MORE SENSE IN ORDER TO

02:15:29.221 --> 02:15:30.455
SERVE THE POPULATION THAT THEY

02:15:30.522 --> 02:15:31.690
HAVE CONTRACTS WITH MULTIPLE

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.225
OTHER YOU KNOW PHARMACY SAID

02:15:33.291 --> 02:15:34.826
THAT THAT BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT TO

02:15:34.893 --> 02:15:36.761
BE ALL SET UP THEIR OWN PHARMACY

02:15:36.828 --> 02:15:38.763
EVERYWHERE RIGHT IN THE HOLE IN

02:15:38.830 --> 02:15:40.866
THE WHOLE AREA. SO I CONTRACT

02:15:40.932 --> 02:15:41.433
PHARMACY MAY MAKE SENSE NOW

02:15:41.500 --> 02:15:42.767
EXACTLY DO THE CONTRACT WITH AND

02:15:42.834 --> 02:15:44.703
WHY. THAT'S THE L. THAT'S NOT

02:15:44.769 --> 02:15:47.973
REALLY MUCH- I DON'T MAKE THOSE

02:15:48.039 --> 02:15:48.807
KIND OF DECISIONS- SO WHY DO

02:15:48.874 --> 02:15:49.975
THEY CHOOSE THE CONTRACT WITH

02:15:50.041 --> 02:15:51.710
ONE PHARMACY AND NOT ANOTHER.

02:15:51.776 --> 02:15:53.645
BUT MAYBE I'LL GO AND PASS IT TO

02:15:53.712 --> 02:15:56.381
MISS TYPE OF TALK ABOUT EXACTLY

02:15:56.448 --> 02:15:57.949
HOW. SOLID COVERED ENTITIES SITE

02:15:58.016 --> 02:16:00.685

02:16:03.455 --> 02:16:05.257
THEY CONTRACT WITH THE PHARMACY.

02:16:05.323 --> 02:16:06.591
YEAH I MEAN APPRECIATE THE

02:16:06.658 --> 02:16:07.726
CONCERN ABOUT HOW THE STATE

THIS CONCERNS WILL BE HAPPY TO

02:16:12.831 --> 02:16:14.866
HAVE MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS

02:16:14.933 --> 02:16:16.968
FOR I CAN SPEAK FROM A P. LA OUR

LAW. NO I I'M FAMILIAR WITH WITH

02:25:24.849 --> 02:25:26.451
HIP- BUT I'M I'M TALKING IN

02:25:26.517 --> 02:25:29.220
TERMS AND CONTEXT OF THIS PIECE

02:25:29.287 --> 02:25:31.289
OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE- SEE MY

02:25:31.355 --> 02:25:32.857
CONCERN AND THE WAY I MAY BE A

02:25:32.924 --> 02:25:35.026
MIS READ IT BUT IT SAYS HERE

02:25:35.093 --> 02:25:36.194
THIS BILL PROHIBITS THE PHARMACY

02:25:36.260 --> 02:25:37.528
BENEFIT MANAGER FROM IMPOSING

A SPECIFIED PHARMACY IN

02:25:45.436 --> 02:25:48.306
CONNECTION WITH DISPENSING COVER

02:25:48.372 --> 02:25:49.474
DRUGS SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE

02:25:49.540 --> 02:25:51.609
OUT IF THE SPECIFIED. PHARMACY

02:25:51.676 --> 02:25:55.446
IS THE- THE BUSINESS- ASSOCIATE

02:25:55.513 --> 02:25:56.814
THAT IS COVERED UNDER COVERED

02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:58.616
ENTITIES OR IS IT SOMETHING

02:25:58.683 --> 02:26:00.284
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT. I THINK IT

02:26:00.351 --> 02:26:01.786
SAID THEY WERE THEY WERE TALKING

02:26:01.853 --> 02:26:03.888
ABOUT THE CONTRACT PHARMACY WITH

02:26:03.955 --> 02:26:05.089
THE- COVERED ENTITY OKAY.

02:26:05.156 --> 02:26:06.557
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT ALSO ON THE

02:26:06.624 --> 02:26:08.626
BILL IT GOES ON TO DEFINE A

02:26:08.693 --> 02:26:12.296
SPECIFIED PHARMACY AS WELL SO. I

02:26:12.363 --> 02:26:14.398
WANTED TO GET MORE MORE CLARITY

02:26:14.465 --> 02:26:17.034
ON THAT AND I THINK THAT- ON MY

02:26:17.101 --> 02:26:18.536
FROM MY POINT OF VIEW I THINK

02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:21.939
THERE'S A- THERE'S A LOT MORE

02:26:22.006 --> 02:26:23.641
THAT WE NEED TO DO IN TERMS OF.

02:26:23.708 --> 02:26:24.642
LOOK WE JUST HEARD EARLIER TODAY

02:26:24.709 --> 02:26:26.944
AND THIS COMMITTEE THAT WE HAVE

02:26:27.011 --> 02:26:28.246
EIGHT EIGHT SENTINEL- EPIDEMIC

02:26:28.312 --> 02:26:31.382
WE HAVE. AN OPIOID CRISIS IN THE

02:26:31.449 --> 02:26:34.652
UNITED STATES AND- WE HAVE TO

02:26:34.719 --> 02:26:36.154
ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S-

02:26:36.220 --> 02:26:37.855
BAD ACTORS OUT THERE NOTHING

02:26:37.922 --> 02:26:41.826
THAT ANYONE IN THIS. IS- BUT I

02:26:41.893 --> 02:26:42.860
YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE SOME

02:26:42.927 --> 02:26:45.329
ACCOUNTABILITY WHEN IT COMES TO

02:26:45.396 --> 02:26:47.932
DISPENSING OP ED YOU NOTE DRUGS

02:26:47.999 --> 02:26:50.201
AND MY CONCERN IS THAT. ALONG

02:26:50.268 --> 02:26:53.337
THIS WAY IN THIS PATH THAT WE

02:26:53.404 --> 02:26:56.140
ARE POTENTIALLY. EXPOSING MORE

02:26:56.207 --> 02:26:59.277
INDIVIDUALS IN IT TO ACCESS.

02:26:59.343 --> 02:27:00.745
DRUGS THAT MAYBE THEY SHOULDN'T

02:27:00.811 --> 02:27:03.247
BE ACCESSING THAT WILL HAVE BAD

02:27:03.314 --> 02:27:05.650
ACTORS- BECAUSE IT I'M ASSUMING

02:27:05.716 --> 02:27:07.218
THAT THERE'S ALREADY BAD ACTORS

02:27:07.285 --> 02:27:09.554
AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALREADY AN

02:27:09.620 --> 02:27:11.155
EFFORT. AN AUDIT THAT. TAKES

02:27:11.222 --> 02:27:14.125
INTO ACCOUNT AND REMOVE THOSE

02:27:14.192 --> 02:27:18.563
BAD ACTORS FROM THE PROCESS. SO

02:27:18.629 --> 02:27:20.464
I I'M CONCERNED THAT IF

02:27:20.531 --> 02:27:23.501
EXPANDED- THAT THAT YOU KNOW

02:27:23.568 --> 02:27:25.403
WE'LL WE'LL HAVE THAT THERE BE

02:27:25.469 --> 02:27:28.339

02:27:30.942 --> 02:27:32.944
