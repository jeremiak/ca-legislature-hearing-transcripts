01:16:09.564 --> 01:16:13.435
IN CALIFORNIA AND THE BE-

01:16:13.502 --> 01:16:15.804

01:16:15.871 --> 01:16:16.905
RECENT PASSAGE OF AB NINETEEN

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:18.707
FIFTY. I DON'T RECALL HOW YOU

01:16:18.774 --> 01:16:19.608

AGAINST IT- YOU CORRECT IF I'M

01:16:22.110 --> 01:16:24.379
WRONG I BET PERHAPS SOME OF THE

01:16:24.446 --> 01:16:25.881
DA'S OF THE WARDENS WOULD HAVE

01:16:25.948 --> 01:16:28.383
BEEN AGAINST IT AS WELL- SO I

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.352
DON'T KNOW IF IT'S FAIR. TO ASK

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.386

01:16:31.453 --> 01:16:34.056

OF THE ONE YEAR PROBATIONARY

01:16:42.230 --> 01:16:46.335
PERIOD WHEN HAVE THEY GIVEN.

01:16:46.401 --> 01:16:48.170
PROBATIONARY PERIODS OF

01:16:48.236 --> 01:16:51.840
DIFFERENT DURATION. AND THE

01:16:51.907 --> 01:16:55.210
EFFECTIVENESS OF ONE OF THOSE

01:16:55.277 --> 01:16:56.845
PERIODS WHEN HAVE THEY SAID

01:16:56.912 --> 01:16:57.646
WELL THIS IS A ONE YEAR

01:16:57.713 --> 01:16:59.314
PROBATIONARY PERIOD I SEE IN IT

01:16:59.381 --> 01:17:02.050
AN EXAMPLE IN THE ANALYSIS OF

01:17:02.117 --> 01:17:04.820
THE THREE YEAR AND A BIG FINE

01:17:04.886 --> 01:17:07.456
THAT HAPPENED- IN ELDORADO-

01:17:07.522 --> 01:17:09.524
COUNTY. IF SO COULD YOU CALL

01:17:09.591 --> 01:17:12.427
WALK ME THROUGH HOW THEY PURSUE

01:17:12.494 --> 01:17:13.729
THE DIFFERENT LENGTHS OF

01:17:13.795 --> 01:17:15.030
PROBATIONARY PERIOD AND WHAT

01:17:15.097 --> 01:17:18.333
THE RECIDIVISM IS FOR THAT FOR

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.535
US TO CONSIDER WALKING BACK A

01:17:20.602 --> 01:17:22.871
VERY SIGNIFICANT REFORM JUST

01:17:22.938 --> 01:17:25.040
PASSED. A FEW MONTHS AGO. YOU

01:17:25.107 --> 01:17:28.477
KNOW ALL THAT- PERHAPS- LARRY

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.579
WOULD BE ABLE TO SPEAK TO THAT

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:33.482
AS A FORMER DA- AS YOU KNOW

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:34.850
NINETEEN FIFTY WAS A VERY BROAD

01:17:34.916 --> 01:17:36.385
ACROSS THE BOARD I DON'T EVEN

01:17:36.451 --> 01:17:39.287
THINK IT WAS REALLY THE INTENT

01:17:39.354 --> 01:17:40.689
TO DO THIS FOR THESE TYPES OF

01:17:40.756 --> 01:17:42.090
CRIMES AND SO WE'RE JUST TRYING

01:17:42.157 --> 01:17:43.658
TO SAY HEY FOR THESE CRIMES

01:17:43.725 --> 01:17:44.860
LET'S TAKE THAT BACK TO THE

01:17:44.926 --> 01:17:46.561
THREE YEAR PROBATION. AND

01:17:46.628 --> 01:17:47.963
REALLY WHAT PROBATION DOES IT

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.564
TAKES WHETHER HUNTING THEY WILL

01:17:49.631 --> 01:17:51.166
NOW NO LONGER BE ABLE TO HUNT

01:17:51.233 --> 01:17:53.001
FOR THOSE THREE YEARS NO MATTER

01:17:53.068 --> 01:17:55.137
HIS LIVELIHOOD PERHAPS WE GOT

01:17:55.203 --> 01:17:56.171
YOU KNOW PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING

01:17:56.238 --> 01:17:58.273
THIS OVER AND OVER AGAIN AND

01:17:58.340 --> 01:17:59.641
MAYBE ONLY. YOU KNOW. LOSING

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:00.942
LOSING THEIR LICENSE FOR ONE

01:18:01.009 --> 01:18:03.045
YEAR MINIMAL PENALTIES. THAT

01:18:03.111 --> 01:18:05.380
DOESN'T REALLY DETER PEOPLE

01:18:05.447 --> 01:18:07.149
FROM DOING THIS AGAIN. APPS CAN

01:18:07.215 --> 01:18:08.517
AND I THINK FOR THE FORMER DA

01:18:08.583 --> 01:18:10.052
I'D LOVE TO HEAR THAT THAT

01:18:10.118 --> 01:18:12.154
COMMENTARY BUT ALSO IF THEY'RE

01:18:12.220 --> 01:18:14.890
WILLING TO POACH WELL WHY NOT

01:18:14.956 --> 01:18:16.024

01:18:16.091 --> 01:18:18.226
ANYHOW SO TO JUST DESCRIBE YOU

01:18:18.293 --> 01:18:19.161

01:18:19.227 --> 01:18:21.196
CRIMINAL ELEMENT THINKING

01:18:21.263 --> 01:18:24.933

CHAIRMAN THANK YOU. WELL THE

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.037
OF. AS I UNDERSTAND IT THE

01:18:29.104 --> 01:18:30.939
LEGISLATION THAT SHORT THE

01:18:31.006 --> 01:18:31.540
PROBATIONARY PERIOD DID CARVE

01:18:31.606 --> 01:18:33.542
OUT EXCEPTIONS. ONE OF THOSE

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:35.377
EXCEPTIONS WAS FOR DO YOU WHY.

01:18:35.444 --> 01:18:36.845
DO YOU WHY DID DRIVING UNDER

01:18:36.912 --> 01:18:38.613
THE INFLUENCE OBVIOUSLY HAS A

01:18:38.680 --> 01:18:39.781
LONGER PROBATIONARY PERIOD

01:18:39.848 --> 01:18:41.516
BECAUSE- AGAIN IT'S A HIGH FIND

01:18:41.583 --> 01:18:43.318
A NEEDS TO BE PAID OFF. BUT IT

01:18:43.385 --> 01:18:45.554
ALSO GIVES THE ABILITY TO. FILE

01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:47.189
A PROBATION YOUR ANSWERS SOME

01:18:47.255 --> 01:18:48.757
SORT OF VIOLATION THE FUTURE

DRIVING WITHOUT A LICENSE EVEN.

01:18:50.525 --> 01:18:52.060
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT THAT

01:18:52.127 --> 01:18:52.861
WOULD VIOLATE THE TERMS OF A

01:18:52.928 --> 01:18:54.696
PROBATION. MISDEMEANOR

01:18:54.763 --> 01:18:55.964
PROBATION IS REALLY NOT A BIG

01:18:56.031 --> 01:19:00.001
DEAL. IT'S A PROBATION TO THE

01:19:00.068 --> 01:19:00.602
COURT ONLY THEY'RE NOT RESPOND

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:01.770
OR NOT- GOING BACK TO PROBATION

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:04.206
OFFICER. IT'S ONLY TO A COURT.

01:19:04.272 --> 01:19:05.674
AND IT IS LIKE OF SOMETHING

01:19:05.740 --> 01:19:07.576
COMES UP AND- THEY WANT TO COME

01:19:07.642 --> 01:19:08.910
BACK AND GET IT WE'RE TALKING

01:19:08.977 --> 01:19:10.545
ABOUT HERE. IS WE'RE TALKING

01:19:10.612 --> 01:19:11.947
ABOUT WHAT I WOULD MUCH RATHER

01:19:12.013 --> 01:19:13.782
HAVE FELONY PROVISIONS. FOR

01:19:13.849 --> 01:19:16.384
COMMERCIAL POACHING- BUT AS

01:19:16.451 --> 01:19:17.886
LONG AS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

01:19:17.953 --> 01:19:20.288
THE YOU KNOW THE HIGH FINES

01:19:20.355 --> 01:19:22.157
AND- AND BROOKE PROHIBITIONS WE

01:19:22.224 --> 01:19:24.593
NEED SOME WAY TO ENFORCE IT.

01:19:24.659 --> 01:19:25.327
AND PROBATION IS THE EASIEST

01:19:25.393 --> 01:19:26.795
WAY TO ENFORCE IT. BECAUSE OF

01:19:26.862 --> 01:19:28.597
PROBATION VIOLATION IS A

01:19:28.663 --> 01:19:29.931
HEARING BEFORE A JUDGE WITH A

01:19:29.998 --> 01:19:31.233
LOWER STANDARD OF PROOF IT

01:19:31.299 --> 01:19:32.868
DOESN'T REQUIRE A JURY TRIAL.

01:19:32.934 --> 01:19:34.703
AND BRING ALL THE PEOPLE AND TO

01:19:34.769 --> 01:19:36.138
PROVE UP OF. A PROBATION

01:19:36.204 --> 01:19:37.372
VIOLATION SO IT'S A LOT EASIER

01:19:37.439 --> 01:19:38.907
PROVEA PROBATION VIOLATION OR

01:19:38.974 --> 01:19:41.243
DISPROVE UP. US A SEPARATE

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:44.079
OFFENSE. AND YOU KNOW AGAIN

01:19:44.146 --> 01:19:45.413
THEY NEED THE TIME TO PAY OFF

01:19:45.480 --> 01:19:46.348
THE FINE SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:19:46.414 --> 01:19:49.451
A HIGH FINES WE NEED TO HAVE

01:19:49.518 --> 01:19:50.385
TIME TO PAY MORE. SO IT TOOK

01:19:50.452 --> 01:19:52.854
YOU CAN. APPROACH THE POINT

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:56.358
ABOUT WHEN YOU HAVE SOUGHT ONE

01:19:56.424 --> 01:19:59.094
YEAR OR TWO YEAR OR THREE YEARS

01:19:59.161 --> 01:20:01.263
AND HOW THAT DOES IN FACT.

01:20:01.329 --> 01:20:04.633
AFFECT BEHAVIOR OF THE POACHER.

01:20:04.699 --> 01:20:06.668

NOT REALLY IMPACT A CHANGE IN

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:16.478
BEHAVIOR. OR IS THAT JUST A

01:20:16.545 --> 01:20:20.582
PUNITIVE MEASURE- YOU KNOW WE

01:20:20.649 --> 01:20:21.583
DON'T HAVE AN OF GAME AWARDS IN

01:20:21.650 --> 01:20:23.018
THE STATE IS IT IS WE HAVE VERY

01:20:23.084 --> 01:20:24.586

WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND THEY DO

01:20:30.592 --> 01:20:31.927
COME BACK AND THAT DOES HAVE AN

01:20:31.993 --> 01:20:33.728
IMPACT ON WHAT HAPPENS IN THE

01:20:44.639 --> 01:20:47.042

01:20:47.108 --> 01:20:50.145
NATIONWIDE- SYSTEM THAT TARGETS

01:20:50.212 --> 01:20:54.349

CAN PICK THEM UP HERE AND WE

01:20:54.983 --> 01:20:56.351

OUT OF STATE. MANY TIMES YEAH

01:20:58.019 --> 01:20:59.254
AND I THINK THIS FOR ME TO BE

01:20:59.321 --> 01:21:00.789
HELPFUL IN LEARNING ABOUT THIS

01:21:00.855 --> 01:21:02.123
THIS PROBATION IS A VERY

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.892
DIFFERENT PUNITIVE MEASURE.

01:21:03.959 --> 01:21:05.694
THAN WHAT WE ARE TYPICALLY

01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:06.995
THINKING ABOUT WHEN WE THINK

01:21:07.062 --> 01:21:08.730

01:21:12.801 --> 01:21:13.835
THAT'S TRUE YEAH. I THINK I

01:21:13.902 --> 01:21:15.870
WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. AND ONLY

01:21:15.937 --> 01:21:17.839

01:52:26.406 --> 01:52:27.707
ABSOLUTE MOST OPTIMISTIC

01:52:27.774 --> 01:52:31.144
SCENARIO FOR MARICULTURE. IS

01:52:31.211 --> 01:52:33.680
THREE TO FOUR YEARS PER PROJECT.

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:35.215
BUT MORE REALISTICALLY IT COULD

01:52:35.281 --> 01:52:37.383
TAKE OVER A DECADE. THAT'S ALL

01:52:37.450 --> 01:52:39.185
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THE DATA IN

01:52:39.252 --> 01:52:41.821
THE PAST TEN YEARS ABOUT TWENTY

01:52:41.888 --> 01:52:43.356
FIVE THOUSAND NEW OIL WELLS HAD

01:52:43.423 --> 01:52:45.358
BEGUN OPERATION IN CALIFORNIA.

01:52:45.425 --> 01:52:47.594
IN THAT SAME TIME FRAME EXACTLY

01:52:47.660 --> 01:52:51.798
ZERO. ZERO NEW SHELLFISH OR SEE

01:52:51.865 --> 01:52:54.167
WE FARMS HAD BEGUN OPERATION.

01:52:54.234 --> 01:52:54.834
AND SO THAT IS WHY THIS

01:52:54.901 --> 01:52:56.369
LEGISLATION PROPOSES TO CREATE

01:52:56.436 --> 01:52:59.038
A PILOT PROGRAM. DETEST AN

01:52:59.105 --> 01:53:00.240
ALTERNATIVE MORE STRAIGHT

01:53:00.306 --> 01:53:02.475
FORWARD APPROACH THE

01:53:02.542 --> 01:53:02.976
CALIFORNIA'S MARICULTURE

01:53:03.042 --> 01:53:05.678
PERMITTING. AND IT WOULD DO SO

01:53:05.745 --> 01:53:07.413
WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE HIGH

01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:10.083
INBOUND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS

01:53:10.150 --> 01:53:11.918
THE INDUSTRY CURRENTLY ACHIEVES.

01:53:11.985 --> 01:53:13.253
THIS LEGISLATION REQUIRES THAT

01:53:13.319 --> 01:53:15.288
CALIFORNIA'S LEADING REGULATORY

01:53:15.355 --> 01:53:18.391
AGENCIES FOR. OCEAN FARMING FOR

01:53:18.458 --> 01:53:21.694
MARICULTURE. TO COLLABORATIVELY

01:53:21.761 --> 01:53:23.329
WORK TOGETHER IN ADOPTED THE

01:53:23.396 --> 01:53:25.465
REGULATIONS FOR THIS PROPOSED

01:53:25.532 --> 01:53:27.834
PILOT PROGRAM. PROVIDING THEM

01:53:27.901 --> 01:53:29.969
WITH THE DISCRETION TO IDENTIFY

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:31.304
THE RIGHT MANAGEMENT PRACTICES

01:53:31.371 --> 01:53:33.573
TO BE DEPLOYED. TO IDENTIFY

01:53:33.640 --> 01:53:35.508
ALLOWED SPECIES FOR BOTH

01:53:35.575 --> 01:53:36.042
RESTORATION AND COMMERCIAL

01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:38.378

01:53:40.146 --> 01:53:41.481
LOCATIONS FOR POTENTIAL

01:53:41.548 --> 01:53:44.951
OPERATIONS. THE RESULT I HOPE

01:53:45.018 --> 01:53:46.052
IS THAT THERE WILL BE AN

01:53:46.119 --> 01:53:47.020
INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:53:47.086 --> 01:53:48.788

ISSUE WE KNOW THAT THERE IS

02:07:21.700 --> 02:07:22.835
DEFINITELY A NEED FOR

02:07:22.901 --> 02:07:24.370
SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE AND

THAT WE HAD- AND ESPECIALLY

02:07:28.974 --> 02:07:30.976
OVER THE RECENT DECADES- BUT

02:07:31.043 --> 02:07:31.677
IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE GET IT

02:07:31.744 --> 02:07:33.245
RIGHT SO THAT WE DON'T. CREATE

02:07:33.312 --> 02:07:36.015
A- AND THAT- NEGATIVE. ON THE

02:07:36.081 --> 02:07:37.816
ENVIRONMENT ON THE QUALITY OF

02:07:37.883 --> 02:07:38.884

CONSUMPTIVE- SEAFOOD- SELF THIS

02:07:44.356 --> 02:07:46.392
IS ONE OF THOSE- THAT YOU KNOW

02:07:46.458 --> 02:07:48.027
WE HAVE TO IMPORT US MOSTLY

02:07:48.093 --> 02:07:49.728
FROM INTERNATIONAL RESOURCES-

02:07:49.795 --> 02:07:51.130
WHY NOT BE ABLE TO FIGURE OUT A

02:07:51.196 --> 02:07:54.199
WAY TO USE OUR- OUR- THE COAST

02:07:54.266 --> 02:07:55.834
RIGHT OFF OF. THOSE MAILS

02:07:55.901 --> 02:07:57.302
MARCOS IN A AND A MORE IN A

02:07:57.369 --> 02:08:01.240
SMARTER WAY- BY THIS BILL FIRST

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:02.608
OF ALL I WANT APPRECIATE IS

02:08:02.674 --> 02:08:05.277
NARROWED- TO SELFISH AND MORE

02:08:05.344 --> 02:08:06.712
IMPORTANTLY TO HELP WHICH WE

02:08:06.779 --> 02:08:08.180
KNOW IS- STARTED TO DISAPPEAR

02:08:08.247 --> 02:08:09.281
OFF OUR COASTLINE IT'S

02:08:09.348 --> 02:08:10.816
IMPORTANT WE CAN'T- THING

02:08:10.883 --> 02:08:11.917
STREAMLINED TO BE ABLE TO

02:08:11.984 --> 02:08:13.852
PROTECT BOTH OF THOSE. WELL

02:08:13.919 --> 02:08:14.853
PROTECT THE RESOURCE AND THEN

02:08:14.920 --> 02:08:18.057
ALSO BE ABLE TO GROW- ITSELF-

02:08:18.123 --> 02:08:19.858
HAS CRAFTED RIGHT NOW I'VE GOT

02:08:19.925 --> 02:08:21.827
A COUPLE OF ISSUES THAT I WANT

02:08:21.894 --> 02:08:23.028
I WANT WANT TO GET TO YES AND I

02:08:23.095 --> 02:08:23.762
JUST HOPE THAT I HAVE A

02:08:23.829 --> 02:08:24.563
COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO

02:08:24.630 --> 02:08:25.531
CONTINUE TO WORK ON SOME OF

02:08:25.597 --> 02:08:28.267
THESE- POINTS- ONE THIS PILOT

02:08:28.333 --> 02:08:29.601
ESTABLISHES A MINIMUM NUMBER

02:08:29.668 --> 02:08:30.903
AND THAT'S FIVE. OF THESE

02:08:30.969 --> 02:08:32.204
TRACKS- BUT IT DOESN'T

02:08:32.271 --> 02:08:33.272
ESTABLISH A MAXIMUM SO

02:08:33.338 --> 02:08:35.140
THEORETICALLY THERE COULD BE

02:08:35.207 --> 02:08:35.974
TWO HUNDRED OR MORE AND THEN

02:08:36.041 --> 02:08:37.509
YOU GET TO A POINT OUT THAT IT

02:08:37.576 --> 02:08:38.610
DOESN'T FEEL LIKE A PILOT

02:08:38.677 --> 02:08:39.745
ANYMORE FEELS LIKE A FULL BLOWN

02:08:39.812 --> 02:08:42.147
OPERATION- SO I'D ENCOURAGE YOU

02:08:42.214 --> 02:08:43.549
TO WORK WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:44.950
FIGURE OUT WHAT MAYBE THAT

02:08:45.017 --> 02:08:45.951
REASONABLE MAXIMUM NUMBER

02:08:46.018 --> 02:08:47.853
SHOULD BE- AND RELATED TO THAT

02:08:47.920 --> 02:08:48.954
A DISTANCE REQUIREMENTS

02:08:49.021 --> 02:08:50.722
BETWEEN. THE DIFFERENT TRACKS

02:08:50.789 --> 02:08:52.057
SITE SO YOU DON'T HAVE FIVE

02:08:52.124 --> 02:08:53.292
RIGHT NEXT TO EACH OTHER KIND

02:08:53.358 --> 02:08:55.194
OF DEFEATS THE PURPOSE OF. A

02:08:55.260 --> 02:08:58.163
THAT SECONDLY- IT REQUIRES

02:08:58.230 --> 02:09:00.666
ENVIRONMENTAL I'M LOOKING FOR

02:09:00.732 --> 02:09:01.800
MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS

02:09:01.867 --> 02:09:03.302
BASICALLY STUDY ABOUT WHERE

02:09:03.368 --> 02:09:04.903
THESE ARE GONNA BE LOCATED- AND

02:09:04.970 --> 02:09:06.371
MAYBE THIS IS INFERRED BUT

02:09:06.438 --> 02:09:07.406
NOTHING IN THE BILL RIGHT NOW

02:09:07.473 --> 02:09:09.541
ACTUALLY WOULD- IT WOULD

02:09:09.608 --> 02:09:12.077
REQUIRE- DONE. THE REGULATORY

02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:13.645
AGENCY TO HAVE TO CONTINUE

02:09:13.712 --> 02:09:20.652
ENVIRONMENTAL. MONITORING SO

02:09:20.719 --> 02:09:21.286
THE LAST THING THAT WE WANT. IS

02:09:21.353 --> 02:09:21.954
TO GO AHEAD AND GIVE THE- LIGHT

02:09:22.020 --> 02:09:22.588
AND THEN HOW SOME. ENVIRONMENT

02:09:22.654 --> 02:09:23.655
EFFECT THE SIR. AREA AN OFFER-

02:09:23.722 --> 02:09:24.723
SO I REALLY WANT TO SEE THAT

02:09:24.790 --> 02:09:25.858
STRENGTH AND TO MAKE SURE THAT

02:09:25.924 --> 02:09:27.226
WE HAVE A REQUIREMENT FOR

02:09:27.292 --> 02:09:30.863
ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING-

02:09:30.929 --> 02:09:34.099
CONDITIONS- THAT. ALSO WOULD-

02:09:34.166 --> 02:09:36.068
THAT WOULD WOULD REQUIRE. A

02:09:36.135 --> 02:09:38.604
TEMPORARY HALT. IN OPERATIONS

02:09:38.670 --> 02:09:40.005
SHOULD WE SEE SOME SORT OF

02:09:40.072 --> 02:09:41.874
ENVIRONMENTAL METRICS-

02:09:41.940 --> 02:09:43.675
NEGATIVELY AFFECTED. DURING THE

02:09:43.742 --> 02:09:45.844
COURSE OF ITS OPERATION-

02:09:45.911 --> 02:09:47.846
THIRDLY- YOU KNOW SENSITIVE

02:09:49.548 --> 02:09:50.482
FOR THE ROLE THAT OUR COASTAL

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:51.517
COMMISSION THE OCEAN PROTECTION

02:09:51.583 --> 02:09:53.685
COUNCIL AND OTHERS TO PLAY- BUT

02:09:53.752 --> 02:09:54.686
I ALSO UNDERSTAND WINE TO BE

02:09:54.753 --> 02:09:55.921
ABLE TO STREAMLINE THIS SORT OF

02:09:55.988 --> 02:09:57.156
MINIMUM AND LIKE TO. BE ABLE TO

02:09:57.222 --> 02:10:00.359
SEE- THE REQUIREMENT FOR DFW TO

02:10:00.425 --> 02:10:02.561
CONSULT. WITH THESE TWO

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:03.662
ORGANIZATIONS OR OTHERS THAT

02:10:03.729 --> 02:10:05.864
MAYBE. TO THEIR POINTS HAVE HAD

02:10:05.931 --> 02:10:07.065
A LOT OF EFFORT A LOT OF

02:10:07.132 --> 02:10:09.168
DEVELOPMENT. A LOT OF FUN AND

02:10:09.234 --> 02:10:10.669
WE APPRECIATE THAT THOUGHT.

02:10:10.736 --> 02:10:11.937
INTO THE WORK THAT WE HAVE FOR

02:10:12.004 --> 02:10:15.040
AQUACULTURE- AND THEN- YOU KNOW

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:16.842
THROUGH THAT. IF YOU KNOW I

02:10:16.909 --> 02:10:17.643

02:10:17.709 --> 02:10:19.144
POINTS IN HERE ABOUT A REPORT

02:10:19.211 --> 02:10:21.180
TO THE LEGISLATURE- IF THINGS

02:10:21.246 --> 02:10:23.482
ARE LOOKING WELL AND- I KNOW

02:10:23.549 --> 02:10:24.483
THE NEXT REPORT WILL COME OUT

02:10:24.550 --> 02:10:26.185
IN THE YEAR TWENTY THIRTY- IF

02:10:26.251 --> 02:10:27.352
THERE IS A DIFFERENT DATE. YOU

02:10:27.419 --> 02:10:28.720
WANT TO LOOK AT THAT POSSIBLY

02:10:28.787 --> 02:10:30.589
SHOW THAT PILOT IS WORKING ON A

02:10:30.656 --> 02:10:33.392
VERY SMALL SCALE- THAT- THAT WE

02:10:33.458 --> 02:10:34.493
MIGHT BE ABLE TO REVISIT THIS

02:10:34.560 --> 02:10:36.328
ISSUE AND- AND SEE ABOUT A

02:10:36.395 --> 02:10:37.596
SCALING UP AGAIN BUT IF

02:10:37.663 --> 02:10:39.531
EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD. LIKE CB

02:10:39.598 --> 02:10:40.933
HAD COMMITMENT TO WORK ON SOME

02:10:40.999 --> 02:10:42.334
OF THESE ISSUES ABSOLUTELY NO I

02:10:42.401 --> 02:10:43.502
REALLY APPRECIATE THE CALMEST

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:45.370
AND AGREE WITH ALL THAT- YOU

02:10:45.437 --> 02:10:47.105
SUGGESTED. YOU KNOW AND WE-

02:10:47.172 --> 02:10:48.941
HAVE ENGAGES STAKEHOLDERS FROM

THE BILL- AND- WE- WILL

02:10:53.445 --> 02:10:54.479
CONTINUE TO ENGAGE WITH THEM.

02:10:54.546 --> 02:10:55.714
YOU KNOW BUT I THINK SOME OF

02:10:55.781 --> 02:10:56.949
THESE SUGGESTIONS AT THE

02:10:57.015 --> 02:10:58.517
COASTAL COMMISSION IS. CUT OUT

02:10:58.584 --> 02:10:59.785
THAT'S NOT TRUE. THE

02:10:59.851 --> 02:11:01.153
LEGISLATION IF YOU LOOK AT THE

02:11:01.220 --> 02:11:02.087
LEGISLATION SPECIFICALLY

02:11:02.154 --> 02:11:05.724
STATES. THAT IT- I BELIEVE

02:11:05.791 --> 02:11:10.362
IT'S- THE DEPARTMENT OF- A

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:11.496
VISION WILDLIFE THAT THEY ARE

02:11:11.563 --> 02:11:13.665
TO. CONSULT THAT THERE TO WORK

02:11:13.732 --> 02:11:14.466
WITH ALL OF THE REGULATORY

02:11:14.533 --> 02:11:18.470
AGENCIES- THAT- YOU KNOW WORK

02:11:18.537 --> 02:11:21.039
IN THIS SPACE IN THIS AREA. OF

02:11:21.106 --> 02:11:22.541
OCEAN FARMING. THAT THEY ARE

02:11:22.608 --> 02:11:24.076
GOING TO WORK TOGETHER. TO

02:11:24.142 --> 02:11:26.311
CREATE THIS MULTI AGENCY ADOPT

02:11:26.378 --> 02:11:27.713
THESE MULTI AGENCY REGULATIONS

02:11:27.779 --> 02:11:29.414
TO GOVERN THIS PILOT PROGRAM.

02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:30.649
AND SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU TALK

02:11:30.716 --> 02:11:32.684
ABOUT C. CO YOU TALK ABOUT. THE

02:11:32.751 --> 02:11:35.020
COASTAL ACT ALL OF THOSE.

02:11:35.087 --> 02:11:39.057
ISSUES ARE TO BE- TAKE PLACE.

02:11:39.124 --> 02:11:40.792
DURING THIS THIS. THIS

02:11:40.859 --> 02:11:42.394
PROMULGATION OF THE REGULATIONS

02:11:42.461 --> 02:11:43.262
THAT'S GONNA GOVERN THIS

02:11:43.328 --> 02:11:45.397
PROGRAM. YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE

02:11:45.464 --> 02:11:47.532

PARAMETERS. OF A- OF

02:11:58.343 --> 02:12:01.246
OPERATIONS- SO THAT WAY IF YOU
