AND I MISTER CRAWFORD IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO WELCOME THE PEOPLE THAT ARE HERE WITH YOU AND GO AHEAD AND GO INTO YOUR COMMENTS AND STATEMENT. THEY WILL TURN IT OVER TO THE COMMITTEE WELCOME THANKS SO MUCH. BOTTOM PRO TEM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR TODAY. I AND FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF MY CONFIRMATION. I AM TRULY HONORED TO BE APPOINTED BY THE GOVERNOR TO SERVICE NOW TO RESOURCES SECRETARY AND REALLY EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU MY APPROACH TO THE WORK -- AS A PRO TEM INVITED ME I'D SET UP A TIME AND BYE TO ME TOO I WANTED TO INTRODUCE MY FAMILY FIRST -- MY WIFE LISA. IN A WAVE ON MY DAUGHTER CALLA WHO IS HIDDEN BEHIND THAT THE FIRST ROW HARDWARE COLORING. SHE MAY OR MAY NOT GET VERY BORED WITH HER PAPA -- TALKING -- AND MY MOM -- DALE WHO'S VISITING FROM MICHIGAN HER FIRST TIME IN SACRAMENTO AND ARE GOOD FAMILY FRIEND I. T. -- LEVITT MALL TIA WAS LAST IN ADVOCATING AND OVER LUNCH DONT DOWNSTAIRS SHE DID ANNOUNCE THAT SHE'S GOING TO BE A GOVERNOR ONE DAY SO. CIRCA TWENTY FORTY TWO OR TWENTY FORTY SIX PROBABLY GIVEN HER AGE. I'M. AND BEFORE I BEFORE I SHARE WITH YOU MY VISION AND MY APPROACH I I JUST WANNA TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WOMEN AND MEN AT THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. I WERE BIG AGENCY -- TWENTY SIX BOARDS DEPARTMENTS IN COMMISSIONS NINETEEN THOUSAND STAFF STRONG. AND THE PROGRESS THAT I'M EXCITED TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS REALLY THE PRODUCT OF THEIR WORK -- OVER YEARS AND SOMETIMES DECADES. AND IT'S BEEN HIGHLIGHTED MY FIRST COUPLE MONTHS ON THE JOB TO ACTUALLY MEET A LOT OF STAFF -- THAT I WOULDN'T HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO MEET AND ELEVATOR AROUND THE BUILDING AND LEARN OF THEIR WORK AND THEIR CAREERS I ACTUALLY I IN THERE AND THE PASSION SO I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THEIR WORK SOMETIMES IT'S AN HONOR TO BE ABLE TO TALK ABOUT THE WORK THAT -- THAT WE'RE DOING TOGETHER AND THAT'S ONE OF THE HOUSE OF PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING THE HARD WORK ON THE FRONT LINES -- SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. IT'S AN IMPORTANT MOMENT. FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE A RANGE OF CHALLENGES -- THREATS TO NATURAL RESOURCES ARE GROWING AS YOU KNOW CLIMATE CHANGE ISWORSENING DROUGHT FLOODS WILDFIRES. SEA LEVEL RISE IN COASTAL EROSION THREATEN OUR COMMUNITIES OUR COASTLINE. ARE RISING TEMPERATURES IN THE SO CALLED HEAT ISLAND COMPLEX ARE GONNA THREATEN PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES. ARE IN YEARS AND DECADES TO COME. AT THE SAME TIME OUR POPULATION IS GROWING YOU KNOW UPWARDS OF FIFTY MILLION PEOPLE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DECADES. OUR ECONOMY IS EXPANDING ALREADY THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY IN THE WORLD. THOSE ARE OF COURSE VERY GOOD THINGS BUT THEY DO PLACE DEMANDS ON OUR NATURAL RESOURCES I INCLUDING WATER AND LAND. I'M AND THEN AND THEN THIRDLY AS THESE CHALLENGES HAVE EVOLVED OVER RECENT DECADES OF FUNDING HAS NOT NECESSARILY KEEP KEPT PLATE PACE. I PARTICULARLY GIVEN FEDERAL DIVESTMENT IN AREAS LIKE A WATER INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WHILE WE WERE WE HAVE THOSE CHALLENGES TO CONTEND WITH I THINK E'RE REALLY WELL POSITIONED TO TACKLE THEM HEAD ON OUR FIRST AND FOREMOST WE HAVE A LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR WHO HAVE PRIORITIZED AND CONTINUE TO PRIORITIZE NATURAL RESOURCES. THINK ABOUT -- WILDFIRE AND FOREST MANAGEMENT PRIORITY RIGHT NOW AND SENATE BILL NINE A ONE THAT'S REALLY PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK FOR THAT. AS AN EXAMPLE. CALIFORNIA VOTERS HAVE ALLOCATED OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE LAST DECADE FOR NATURAL RESOURCES. COURSE PROPOSITION ONE THE WATER BOND IN TWENTY FOURTEEN MOST RECENTLY PROPOSITION SIXTY EIGHT I IN JUNE. AND THEN MAYBE MOST PROBABLY CALIFORNIANS FROM MY PERSPECTIVE REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT WE'RE WORKING TO DO WHAT NATURAL RESOURCES. AND THAT IS PROTECT OUR ENVIRONMENT I IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY ALLOW US TO UTILIZE OUR NATURAL RESOURCES FOR THE BENEFIT OF OUR QUALITY OF LIFE AND IN OUR ECONOMY. SO WHAT WE HAVE CHALLENGES I THINK WE'RE REALLY WELL POSITIONED. TO ADDRESS HOSE CHALLENGES. THEY'LL BE TO PRIORITIES -- THAT WILL GUIDE OR SHAPE A LOT OF MY WORK I IT HOPEFULLY IN IN COMING MONTHS AND YEARS. I'M ONE IS -- TO HELP OUR COMMUNITIES ARE NATURAL SYSTEMS BECOME MORE RESILIENT TO THESE CHALLENGES. I'M SO NATURAL RESOURCES ON THE A REAL TRINITY OF THREATS THE FLOODS THE DROUGHTS THE WILD FIRES. AND I THINK WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS IN CALIFORNIA TO PROTECT PEOPLE THE COMMUNITIES ARE FROM. THOSE IMPACTS ON THOSE THREATS IN OUR NATURAL SYSTEMS THE FISH AND WILDLIFE THAT DEPEND ON THEM -- WE THINK ABOUT THE INTENSE FOCUS THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE HAVE ON PROTECTING COMMUNITIES FROM WILDFIRE. I IN THE WAKE OF THE CAMPFIRE IN THE TRAGEDY IN PARADISE. THAT'S ONE CURRENT COMPELLING EXAMPLE OF THE RESILIENCE THE TYPE OF WORK WE NEED TO DO BUILDING RESILIENCE. THE SECOND BROAD PRIORITY IS TO BETTER CONNECTOR STRENGTH IN THE CONNECTION BETWEEN PEOPLE AND NATURE PEOPLE AND NATURAL PLACES. I'M REALLY EXCITED TO FOLLOW THE LEGISLATURE'S LEAD ON HELPING TO IMPLEMENT. A VISION TO EXPAND PARK ACCESS TO ALL CALIFORNIANS PARTICULARLY THOSE CALIFORNIANS THAT LIVING COMMUNITIES NOW THAT HAVEN'T -- TRADITIONALLY BEEN ABLE TO ENJOY PARKS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THOSE PARTS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES. SO AS WE BEGIN THIS WORK -- AND AS I HOPE TO BEGIN THIS WORK I MEAN I'LL I'LL APPLY AT LEAST FOUR BROAD PRINCIPLES. NOT. TO TO THESE PRIORITIES. NUMBER ONE IS TO BE GUIDED BY SCIENCE -- WE ARE LUCKY TO BE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS IN THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HAVE. NOW TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT IS COMPLICATED AND SO AND EVERYTHING FROM WATER TO FISH AND WILDLIFE TO FORESTRY WE NEED TO WE NEED TO BE GUIDED BY YOU KNOW OBJECTIVE SCIENCE AND MONITORING [inaudible] SECOND PRINCIPLE. THAT I REALLY WANT TO BRING TO THE WORK IS TO BREAK DOWN SILOS ACROSS DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES. AND MY EXPERIENCE IN STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENT IS OFTENTIMES IN SUCH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS EITHER CAN BE REALLY A DISCONNECT. AMONG THE DEPARTMENTS AND AGENCIES AND SO WHILE WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARD THE SAME MAN OFTENTIMES THERE'S DUPLICATION OR CONFLICT I WHEN WE'RE WHEN WE'RE NOT WORKING TO BE INTEGRATED. THIRD PRINCIPLE IS TO PRIORITIZE COLLABORATION WITH FOLKS OUTSIDE OF GOVERNMENT. SO TO GET OUT OF THAT BUBBLE THAT IS SACRAMENTO AND ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND -- THE IMPACTS OF OUR WORK I'M GROUPS LIKE OF FARMERS AND FORESTERS AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION GROUPS. HI COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. SO WE NEED TO GET OUT THERE ACTUALLY IN PROACTIVE EMPHASIS ON COMMUNITIES -- THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM PAST CONVERSATIONS. SO THAT REALLY SPEAKS TO THE THE ELEVATION OF EQUITY I ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AND IN THE FOURTH PRINCIPLE I THINK WHICH IS IMPORTANT THIS ROLE IS TO BUILD A REALLY STRONG TEAM. BUILDING ON THE TALENTED WOMEN AND MEN WE HAVE A THE AGENCY ALREADY MY GOAL IS TO BUILD A DIVERSE TEAM -- WITH A SET OF LEADERS -- THAT KNOW THEIR WORK -- AND THAT WANT TO MAKE CHANGE AND EMPOWER THEM TO EAD. I THINK THEY NEED TO DO REALLY. FOR THINGS FIRST IS REALLY SICK TO UNDERSTAND ALL VIEW POINTS I AM THE ISSUES THAT WE FACE. ARE SECONDLY IS TO ROLL UP SLEEVES AND ACTUALLY DIRECTLY ENGAGE IN PROBLEM SOLVING -- AND TO AVOID. AN APPROACH WEBER JUST HAVE US AGAIN IN THE RESOURCES AGENCY REACTIVE BUT MUCH MORE PROACTIVE. NOW COMMUNICATE CAN CONSTRUCTIVELY INDIRECTLY. I AND THEN LASTLY MAKE DECISIONS IN A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT AND DECISIVE WAY. THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO GET DONE AND MY GOAL FOR OUR TEAM TO COMMUNICATE WITH YOU ON THE LEGISLATURE OTHER AGENCIES STAKEHOLDERS. GATHER INFORMATION WE NEED TO AND THEN REALLY MAKE DECISIONS AND MAKE PROGRESS IMPLEMENTING POLICIES MADE IN THIS BUILDING AND BY THE GOVERNOR. SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THE WORK AND AM EXCITED ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU HAVE. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET ME START WITH THE GOOD SENATOR TO MY RIGHT HERE SENATOR ROTH. pCRAWFORD CONGRATULATIONS. YOU HAVE A VERY VERY IMPRESSIVE -- EDUCATIONAL BACKGROUND AND SEEMS TO ME FROM REVIEWING YOUR CREDENTIALS AT YOUR WORK EXPERIENCES EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT AND RELEVANT TO THE TEST THAT -- YOU'VE BEEN -- DESIGNATED TO PERFORM SO CONGRATULATIONS AND I DO LOOK FORWARD TO OF A MAKING THE MOTION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME TO CONFIRM YOUR APPOINTMENT. WITH FOR THIS IS NOT YOUR FIRST RODEO WITH RESPECT TO HAVING TO DEAL WITH NATURAL DISASTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THAT WITH THE PER [inaudible] ADMINISTRATION. SO AND BASED ON THAT EXPERIENCE VERY VERY. INTENSE EXPERIENCE I'M SURE. WHAT OURS OURS SPECIFIC OPTIONS WITH RESPECT? TO ATTEMPTING TO REDUCE THE SCOPE OF THESE FOREST RELATED DISASTERS THE CERTAINLY HAVE BEEN OUR IMMEDIATE PAST AND LOOK TO BE OUR FUTURE. PERHAPS VERY VERY FAR DISTANT FUTURE. YEAH SO FROM MY PERSPECTIVE WE HAVE TO PURSUE AN ALL OF THE ABOVE APPROACH AND I'LL TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS. YOU KNOW WE'RE REALLY FACING A DOUBLE WHAMMY WHEN IT COMES -- TO WILDFIRE THREATS. ON THE ONE HAND WE HAVE DRYER FORESTS WE HAVE AN EPIDEMIC OF TREE MORTALITY -- WE HAVE HEIGHTENED RISKS OF THESE MEGA FIRES I LIKE WE SEEN. AND AT THE SAME TIME OUR DEVELOPMENT PATTERNS IN CALIFORNIA HAVE WORKED TO SUPPRESS FIRES TO PROTECT LIVES OVER A CENTURY. I AND SO WE HAVE FOREST'S THAT ARE -- REALLY IN -- AND THE FIRES WITH EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AS YOU KNOW TWENTY EIGHTEEN EASILY THE MOST DEVASTATING. WILDFIRE YEAR IN TERMS OF LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY. SO PART OF THE ANSWER IS ACTUALLY ACTIVE MANAGEMENT OF OUR FORESTS -- BOTH AROUND COMMUNITIES AND MORE BROADLY AT THE LANDSCAPE LEVEL. GOVERNOR NEW SOME ON HIS FIRST FULL DAY IN OFFICE ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER DIRECTING CAL FIRE TO IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO DO RIGHT NOW. TO PROTECT VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- SO WE DON'T HAVE THE TRAGEDY OF WE MINIMIZE THE RISK OF THE TRAGEDY OF PARADISE HAPPENING THIS FIRE SEASON. ARE IN SO CAL FIRE ISSUED -- A SET OF RECOMMENDATIONS AND I'M SPENDING A LOT OF MY TIME RIGHT NOW WORKING TO GET THIRTY FIVE EMERGENCY PROJECTS ON THE GROUND AROUND COMMUNITIES TO PROTECT TWO HUNDRED ON A BOOK COMMUNITIES. SO THERE'S WORK IN THE FORCE THAT WE NEED TO DO. BUT THERE'S ALSO WORK IN THESE COMMUNITIES THAT WE NEED TO DO -- AS I HAD A CHANCE TO TALK TO SOME OF YOU ABOUT -- THE NATURE OF SOME OF THESE FIRES IS -- HEAVILY WIND DRIVEN EVENTS SO IN SOME FLAMING EMBERS -- FLOATING HEAD OF THE FIRE LINE TWO THREE MILES -- AND SO WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE HOME HARDENING I THAT IS THINGS THAT WE CAN DO WITH OUR EXISTING HOUSING STOCK NEW HOUSING STOCK TO PROTECT THOSE -- HOMES ARE FROM IGNITING. AND WE ALSO NEED TO REPAIR COMMUNITIES -- OBVIOUSLY -- THERE ARE YOU KNOW ALMOST A HUNDRED PEOPLE LOST THEIR LIVES IN PARADISE BUT WHAT'S LAST KNOWN IN PARADISE IS THAT WAS A COMMUNITY THAT HAD REALLY. THRILLED QUITE EXTENSIVELY ON EVACUATIONS. AND PART OF THE REASON WHY THERE WEREN'T MANY MORE DEATHS IS THAT ACTUALLY THAT COMMUNITY EVACUATED VERY QUICKLY. AND I WOULD ARGUE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE VULNERABLE TO WILDFIRE THAT ARE NOT AS WELL PREPARED -- SO WE HAVE TO WORKERS YOU KNOW CAL FIRE IS PART OF THE SOLUTION BUT WE HAVE TO WORK ACROSS AGENCIES -- WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO LEADING THAT EFFORT. WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING YOU DO THAT CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM. THE VICE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR -- WE HAD A CONVERSATION ABOUT MY CONCERN ABOUT AG NOT GETTING ENOUGH WATER BECAUSE THEY TAKE A LOT OF WATER AND IT'S ONLY ABOUT AND YOU'RE SURE TO ME THAT THAT WE'RE GONNA BE GOOD ON THAT. I'M JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE I HEARD HIM THIS MORNING FOR THE FIRST TIME I MIGHT BE MISSING PREP PRONOUNCING HIS NAME I I WANT TO KNOW IF YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT HE'S A HE'S A PROFESSOR UC DAVIS DR FRANK. MEANT LOTION -- NOTHING REALLY WITHIN SO HE SELL BE HE IS ALL ABOUT SUSTAINABLE AGRICULTURE AND ANDHOW WE CAN REDUCE OUR OUR OUR OUR CARBON FOOTPRINT THROUGH THAT I LOVE TO PUT YOU GUYS TOGETHER. I IT WAS INCREDIBLY FASTENING HIS HIS TWITTER HANDLE. IS A G. H. G. GURU. AND SO I SURF ALL HIM TODAY SO I I RECOMMEND THAT SO. HE DOES GREAT SO I WANT SO MUCH ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE OBVIOUSLY AND I BET YOU KNOW I'M SOMEBODY THAT BELIEVES THERE'S CLIMATECHANGE I MEAN I THINK THERE'S ENOUGH DATA THERE -- BEEN WITH FARMERS IN NAPA OVER CHANGED OUT THERE OF RYE OTHER VARIETALS BECAUSE THEY CAN'T GROW CHARDONNAY ANYMORE. I'VE BEEN IN CHILE WHERE THE ARTISANAL FISHERMEN HAD TO CHANGE WHAT KIND OF FISH THEY ARE CATCHING AND I'VE BEEN DOWN THE GPL -- YOU KNOW TRACKING JASON NINE WHICH TAX OF SEA LEVEL RISE. I THINK HERE WE DO ANY IN HOW WE DRESS IT IS TOO MUCH ON THE REGULATORY AND TAXATION SIDE. AND NOT ENOUGH ON ON THE INSIDE ANY. AREAS WE SEE WHERE WE COULD BE PROVIDING AND INCENTIVES TO TO REDUCE GLOBAL EMISSIONS YEAH I'LL ANSWER THAT QUESTION ACTUALLY BRIDGE YOUR FOR YOUR FIRST COMMON IF I COULD. SO. YOU KNOW FROM FROM MY PERSPECTIVE AND CERTAINLY TAKING THE LEAD FROM THE GOVERNOR WE NEED A BALANCE WATER POLICY AND ABOUT -- WATER POLICY THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF CITIESAND TOWNS. ARE KANA ME AGRICULTURE IN THE NATURAL ENVIRONMENT. AND SO IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE ACTUALLY HELP CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE I CONTINUE TO THRIVE. I'M SOME FOLKS BROUGHT A NUMBER THAT SAYS AGRICULTURE IS ONLY 2% OF GDP WHY THEY USE AS MUCH WATER WHEN I ANSWER IS. YOU KNOW GROWING FOOD AND FIBER. TAKES A LOT OF WATER I AND WE OBVIOUSLY ALL NEED THAT -- A LARGE REGION OF OUR ECONOMY WITH FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS CENTRAL VALLEY DEPENDS ON THAT AS THEIR LIFEBLOOD AND OF COURSE THE LIFEBLOOD OF AGRICULTURE IS WATER -- SO WHILE WE MODERNIZE OUR OUR WATER INFRASTRUCTURE WATER MANAGEMENT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH AGRICULTURE SO IT CAN IT HAS A WATER CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE. YOUR POINT ON CLIMATE CHANGE. AND WHERE YOU CAN ACTUALLY FIND INCENTIVES AGRICULTURE ISA IS A REALLY IMPORTANT SECTOR THAT'S A PARTNER I'M ACTUALLY REDUCING EMISSION REDUCTION AND MUTE A REDUCING EMISSIONS AND CAPTURING. OUR CARBON -- WE CAN CREATE INCENTIVES FOR FARMING PRACTICES THAT ACTUALLY GENERATE ANCILLARY REVENUE STREAMS FOR FARMERS -- IN WAYS THAT ACTUALLY SEQUESTER CARBON AND PROVIDE A HABITAT BENEFITS -- DISKETTES TALKED ABOUT AS ECOSYSTEM BUDDY A STEWARD OR RANCHER A FARMER AND THERE ARE A STEWARD OF THE LAND YES THERE RAISING FOOD THEY MIGHT BE RAISING LIVESTOCK OR CROPS. BUT THEY'RE ALSO -- MAKING MONEY I CONTRIBUTING TO OTHER PUBLIC VALUES INCLUDING OUR CLIMATE EFFORTS IN PROVIDING HABITAT FOR EXAMPLE A THREATENED. SPECIES SO I'M REALLY EXCITED ON IT WITHIN THE AGENCY MORE NOT FUNDAMENTALLY REGULATORY AGENCY TO REALLY EXPLORE WHERE THERE CAN BE WIN WIN VOLUNTARY INCENTIVES. MADAM MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AS QUESTIONS LOOKING FORWARD TO VOTING FOR YOUR CONFIRMATION TODAY CONGRATS THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR BATES. THANK YOU AND AGAIN MISTER CRAWFORD CONGRATULATIONS AND WE HAD A GREAT CONVERSATION NOW. WHEN YOU CAME OUT AND VISITED US FIGHTING HIM [inaudible] YOU KNOW. MORE THAN PERSONALLY OR PERSONALLY OF THAT I THINK OF THAT TIME I SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO YOU ABOUT TWO ISSUES FLUBS CERTAINLY FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES. A SENATOR WILK CONCERNED ABOUT CHILD CLIMATE CHANGE IN IN MY COMMUNITY AT SEA RISE. AND OTHER AREAS MANY THAT'S BEEN APPROPRIATED THROUGH A CONSERVANCY AND BASICALLY GONE MORE NORTH SIDE TO SAN FRANCISCO. AND I'M HOPING THAT YOU'LL TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IN TERMS OF THE RESOURCES THAT WILL BE NEEDED DOWN IN OUR SOUTH COAST AREAS. THEY HAVE A LOT OF YOU KNOW SAND REPLENISHMENT ISSUES WE HAVE REVETMENT ISSUES SO YOU SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT YOUR YOUR FOCUS ON THAT ISSUE GO FORWARD BECAUSE THAT CERTAINLY PART OF THE WHOLE -- COMPREHENSIVE LOOK AT CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT IT'S DOING -- SPECIFICALLY TO VARIOUS REGIONS FIRST. TOTALLY AGREE WE NEED A A PORTION -- FUNDING -- ACROSS THE STATE -- AND THERE HAS BEEN I THINK A VALID CRITICISM IN THE PAST ACROSS PROGRAMS -- THAT -- SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOST POPULOUS REGION THE STATE DOESN'T GET AT INAPPROPRIATE -- SHARE RESOURCE AND I KNOW SOME ENTITIES INCLUDING THE STRATEGIC GROWTH COUNCIL HAVE REALLY DONE A DEEP DIVE IN UNDERSTANDING -- HOW WE CAN BE SURE THE FAIR APPORTIONMENT SO YES ABSOLUTELY RESOURCE AGENCY ARE REALLY ALLOCATE A LOT OF BOND FUNDING YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT ON THAT? AND THEN ON SEA LEVEL RISE. ABSOLUTELY -- THIS IS A HUGE UNDER RECOGNIZE CHALLENGE WITH COASTAL COMMUNITIES RIGHT NOW AND A TERRIBLY EXPENSIVE. ONE THE STATE'S APPROACH IN THE AGENCY'S APPROACH IS NUMBER ONE TO REALLY -- HELP LOCAL COMMUNITIES UNDERSTAND THE SCIENCE RIGHT IS TERRIBLY COMPLICATED AND WHAT COMMUNITIES ONE UNDERSTAND IS WHAT WILL THE IMPACT BE ON OUR BEACHES ON OUR MARINO AS YOU KNOW ON A COASTAL AREAS AND SO. WE WORK TO REALLY TAKE WHAT IS COMPLICATED PLANETARY SCIENCE AND DOWNSCALE IT SO LOOKS SO LOCAL LEADERS CAN ACTUALLY MAKE DECISIONS ON THAT. AND THEN BUILDING OFF THAT ARE -- REALLY LIKE A A GUIDE BOOK OR A PLAY BOOK FOR DECISION MAKING -- ON ON SEA LEVEL RISE SO THE GOAL IS TO PROVIDE A LOT OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE THE SMALLER COMMUNITIES THAT REALLY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES TO HAVE THAT EXPERTISE IN HOUSE. BUT THEN WE NOW HAVE OBVIOUSLY UP TO HELP COMMUNITIES BE ABLE TO AFFORD THE CHANGES THAT THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE. AND I'LL BE CAN'T CANDID I DON'T THINK THAT YOU KNOW RESOURCES% EXIST YOU KNOW RIGHT NOW IN BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND STATE GOVERNMENTS TO TO FULLY ADDRESS. ALL THE CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE BUT I'M CERTAINLY -- COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO ADVANCE THE POLICIES IN THE GUIDANCE BUT THEN ALSO FIND WAYS TO DEVELOP RESOURCES TO HELP COMMUNITIES LIKE YOURS THAT ARE. WILL BE FACING THIS THIS ARE THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE MORE AND MORE IF. AND I THINK IT HAPPENED WHAT WILL WE RECEIVED A LOT OF WARNINGS BUT ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WAS HERE. AND SEEING IT SIGNIFICANTLY THIS YEAR OBVIOUSLY Là WITHOUT THE RAINFALL WE'VE HAD. A VERY QUICKLY SECOND QUESTION A WE DID DISCUSS THE ISSUE OF CLARK'S WHICH IS ANOTHER BIG. ARM. CONCERNED AREA LOG IN MY COMMUNITY AND IN PARTICULAR I'LL AGAIN OB MORE THIS NOR SAN DIEGO AREAS WHERE WE HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THAT WANT TO PARTNER. WITH STATE PARKS ON THE BEACH -- THE STATE PARKS ALONG THE BEACHES AND THERE'S NOT BEEN. LET'S SAY ON A GOOD COOPERATIVE BY ENGAGEMENT AND I KNOW YOU OF TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND ARE. COMMITTED TO YOU KNOW MAKING I'LL BRING YOU MORE THE LOCALS ARE ON BOARD AND BEYOND NOT HELPING WITHOUT SO. JUST ON THE RECORD IF YOU CHAIR YOU OUT ON THAT BE DID -- TO THE SENATE WE HAVEN'T SOLVED IT YEAH WAS FOUR YEARS AGO SO YEAH. WELL FIRST OF ALL I'M REALLY EXCITED AND ENERGIZED TO HELP CONTINUE TO IMPROVE UR STATE PARKS THE TALK ABOUT REALLY CONNECTING PEOPLE -- AND ARE OUTDOORS STATE PARKS ARE REALLY THE POINT OF THE SPEAR AT THAT AND IF YOU THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS WHERE YOU ACTUALLY YOU KNOW SEE BENEFIT. PARKS STATE PARKS I'M PARTICULARLY IN YOUR DISTRICT GIVEN ALL YOUR STATE BEACHES I MEAN HUGE COMMUNITY ASSET. I THINK THE PARKS DEPARTMENT OUR STATE PARKS HAS HAS BUT ALSO CONTINUES TO NEED TO TAKE THE APPROACH THAT EACH PARK. NEEDS TO BE MANAGED OBVIOUSLY TO A STANDARD BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THE LOCAL CHARACTER OF THOSE PARKS. I'M IN THE COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ARE SOMETIMES EITHER FORMAL PARTNERS OR INFORMAL PARTNERS AS WELL AS THE CONCESSIONAIRES AND THE VENDORS -- WHO ARE ACTUALLY PART OF THE CULTURAL FABRIC OF THOSE PARKS IT'S A PART OF A CHALLENGE WITH THE STATE PARKS DEPARTMENT IS? REALLY WORKING TO MODERNIZE ITS SYSTEMS TO ENSURE A STRONG FISCAL OVERSIGHT -- OF ALL OF IT PARKS SO HOW DO WE MODERNIZE THOSE CONTRACTS -- BUT BRING BUT BUT SENSITIVE TO YOU KNOW THOSE UNIQUE CONCESSIONAIRES SO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT AND I THINK IT'S WORK WHERE THE KIND OF THE ROLLING UP SLEEVES NATURE OF THE JOB COMES THEN WHICH IS. YOU KNOW MY TEAM AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY WANTS TO HELP. YOU ALL I PROBLEMS OFF AS YOU THANK YOU I CONSTITUENTS HERE CERTAINLY I YOU BàN OUT THERE ALREADY TALKING ABOUT THAT ARE VERY EXCITED. SO THANK YOU AGAIN CONGRATULATIONS AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND WELCOME SECRETARY CROWFOOT -- HAS A NICE RING TO IT IN A ONE WELCOME YOUR FAMILY AS WELL AND FRIENDS AND THANK THEM FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND SHARING YOU WITH. THE PEOPLE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY AND WE COVERED. A LOT OF GROUND IN YOU'VE MENTIONED SOME OF IT TODAY -- THE BIG PICTURE INCREASED COSTS FOR FIRE SUPPRESSION MORE INVESTMENT. IN PREVENTION AND HARDENING COMMUNITIES -- FROM A PUBLIC SAFETY PROTECTIVE POINT OF VIEW. IS YOUR AGENCY IN THE DEPARTMENT YOU'LL DIRECT ADEQUATELY RESOURCE FOR THE GREATER DEMANDS THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS BRINGING TO OUR STATE AND OUR PLANET. WELL I WILL TELL YOU -- AND THANK YOU THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR ACTUALLY THROUGH SB NINE A ONE YOU KNOW ALLOCATING TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR OR OR PROPOSING TO ALLOCATE TO A MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS. THAT REPRESENTS SKILLED OF RESOURCES THAT'S GOING TO ALLOW CAL FIRE TO DO THE FORCE WORK AROUND THESE VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES -- BUT DIRECTLY I THINK IT'S AN OPEN QUESTION ABOUT HOW WE'RE GONNA RESOURCES BROADER WILD FIRE SAFETY IN FORCE MANAGEMENT -- CHALLENGE ARE WE HAVE -- WILDLANDS IN THE STATE ABOUT A THIRD OF IT'S FORESTED IN OAKLAND AT CETERA. AND A LOT OF THAT -- I WOULD ARGUE NEEDS TO BE MANAGED AND THAT'S OF A SCALE -- THAT FRANKLY DWARFS THE GENERAL FUND ABILITY. AND SO THEN THE QUESTION IS. HOW DO YOU DEVELOP? INCENTIVES I TO GET LOCAL COMMUNITIES I AND OTHER PARTNERS ON THE LAND TO ACTUALLY MANAGE THE LAND. I. IN SO BIO ENERGY FOR EXAMPLE IS ONE I POTENTIAL SOLUTION THAT'S BEEN DISCUSSED I THINK IT'S A BROAD POLICY DIALOGUE THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE IN COMING YEARS. BUT I THINK THAT AND I KNOW THAT THANK THINKS THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR WE HAVE RESOURCES RIGHT NOW THAT WE NEED TO PROTECT THESE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU IN. THAT'S KIND OF THE CRISIS FRONT MAN THERE'S OUR ONGOING. MAINTENANCE AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FOR PARKS ESPECIALLY BUT OTHER. ON RESOURCES UNDER YOUR OVERSIGHT AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND SEE HOW WE CAN. MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT. ON THE LOSING END OF A TREADMILL NOT INVESTING ENOUGH IN OUR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE TO WHERE THE COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE THE THOUGHT SON. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE CHALLENGES WELL I I THINK THE KNOWLEDGE KNOWLEDGE THEM AS A CHALLENGE -- I MENTIONED OVER TEN BILLION DOLLARS OF GENERAL OBLIGATION BOND FUNDING THAT VOTERS HAVE APPROVED I AND THAT FUNDING IS REALLY VALUABLE. I ENDED HAS GENERALLY BEEN FOR A ONE TIME CAPITAL. INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE TYPICALLY WHAT GEO BONDS OR SPEND TIME. IN SO ONE AREA THAT I'M FOCUSED ON IS REALLY UNDERSTANDING WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES WE NEED TO OPERATE AND MAINTAIN. OUR ASSETS WHETHER IT'S A PARK OR IT'S A FOREST LAND OR YOU KNOW IT'S A WILDLIFE PRESERVE -- BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT TO DO IS SPEND A LOT OF RESOURCES ON UPGRADING ASSET OR OR DEVELOPING AN ASSET AND THE NOT MAINTAINING IT. SO THAT'S AN AREA OF FOCUS IN COMING MONTHS AND YEARS THANK YOU AND THEN JUST A FINAL QUESTION IF I MIGHT YOU MENTIONED. FIRE FLOOD IN C. RISE AS CRISES FACING OUR STATE -- I KNOW YOU'VE ALSO ADDRESS THE CRISIS OF CLEAN SAFE DRINKING WATER AND CLOSE TO A MILLION CALIFORNIANS. FLEA MAYBE YOUR THOUGHTS ON HOW WE PRIORITIZE THIS SEASON WHAT ROLE YEAH OR AGENCY MY EARLY JUST FOLLOWING THE GOVERNOR'S -- YOU KNOW LEAD ON THIS. YOU KNOW I THINK WE ALL ACKNOWLEDGE THE CRISIS IN OUR MIDST -- YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S LAST DIRECTLY RELATED TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND MORE DIRECTLY RELATED TO NATURALLY OCCURRING -- YOU KNOW POLLUTION AND SOME YOU KNOW CONTAMINATION OVER TIME BUT I THINK MOST ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S AN IT'S AN ISSUE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH. I AND THE GOVERNOR SAID ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS HE'S HOPING. I THINK -- REASONABLE MINDS HAVE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION AROUND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS IT. I AND WOULD CERTAINLY -- DEFERRED TO THE POLICY MAKERS EXACTLY HOW THAT GETS DONE -- BUT I JUST KNOW YOU KNOW GIVING VOICE TO THE GOVERNOR'S INTENSITY ON THIS WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY -- BE PART OF A SOLUTION THAT CAN ENSURE THAT YOU KNOW BEGINNING. THE END OF THE YEAR -- THERE'S ACTUALLY A PATHWAY TO ENSURING THOSE FOLKS THAT LIVE IN HOMES WITH TOXIC WATER I'M ACTUALLY WILL GET RELIEF. THANK YOU AND I APPRECIATE YOUR ON GOING WORK ON THAT. LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU IN YOUR AGENT SENIOR DEPARTMENTS. AND I WOULD MAKE A MOTION BUT I THINK MY COLLEAGUE ALREADY RESERVED THE SPACE TO DO THAT SAW THE FOR BACK TO THE CHAIR THANK YOU.

WHAT ARE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGES RIGHT NOW FACING YOU WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY CHALLENGES BUT THAT WAS TOP OF YOUR LIST AND OBVIOUSLY?
