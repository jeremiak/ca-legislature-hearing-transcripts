THAT A SITUATION OF A LENGTHY

IMPACTS THE ECONOMY AND

EVERYDAY LIVES OF CALIFORNIANS.

NATURE OF THE CALL THE NINETEEN

THE RESPONSE TO THIS EMERGENCY.

00:56:40.330 --> 00:56:41.698
RAISES QUESTIONS AROUND WHETHER

00:56:41.765 --> 00:56:42.699
THE STATE'S EMERGENCY LAW

00:56:42.766 --> 00:56:44.467

00:56:47.237 --> 00:56:47.704
COMMENTS ON SUCH POTENTIAL

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:49.205
CHANGES. THERE'S REALLY TWO

00:56:49.272 --> 00:56:50.540
BROAD CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:52.742
OF AND CHANGES THAT COULD BE

00:56:52.809 --> 00:56:53.610
MADE TO THE STATE'S EMERGENCY

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:56.146
LIGHTS. I'M IN ONE CATEGORY THE

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:57.781
LEGISLATURE COULD MAKE CHANGES

00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.849
TO LIMIT THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:56:59.916 --> 00:57:01.918
EMERGENCY AUTHORITIES. HOWEVER

00:57:01.985 --> 00:57:03.253
THIS WOULD LIKELY LIMIT THE

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:06.156
STATE'S ABILITY TO RESPONDING

00:57:06.222 --> 00:57:08.391
NIMBLY TO EMERGENCIES. I NEVER

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:09.659
HAD A GREAT CHANGES THAT COULD

00:57:09.726 --> 00:57:11.127
BE CONSIDERED WOULD BE TO

ADDING IN CHECKS AND BALANCES

00:57:18.968 --> 00:57:20.870
TO INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY AND

00:57:20.937 --> 00:57:21.404
TRANSPARENCY OF EMERGENCY

00:57:21.471 --> 00:57:23.606
DECISION. FOR EXAMPLE REQUIRING

00:57:23.673 --> 00:57:25.241
REPORTING ON EMERGENCY SPENDING

00:57:25.308 --> 00:57:26.843
WE GET THE LEGISLATURE

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:27.710

RESPONSE TO EMERGENCIES. I

00:57:31.581 --> 00:57:32.782
WOULD ALSO AVOID CIRCUMSTANCES

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:33.683
WHERE THE LEGISLATURE HAS

00:57:33.750 --> 00:57:35.318
REQUESTED INFORMATION BUT THE

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.320
ADMINISTRATION IS NOT PROVIDING

00:57:37.387 --> 00:57:39.055
IT IN A TIMELY MANNER. OTHER

00:57:39.122 --> 00:57:40.690
CHANGES COULD INCLUDE REQUIRING

00:57:40.757 --> 00:57:42.058
ADMINISTRATION TO INFORM THE

00:57:42.125 --> 00:57:43.493

00:57:44.127 --> 00:57:46.429
SPENT. OR PLACING LIMITS ON

00:57:46.496 --> 00:57:47.463
TOTAL SPENDING TO ENSURE THAT

00:57:47.530 --> 00:57:48.598
THE TOTAL SPENDING ON

EMERGENCIES DOES NOT HAVE

00:57:49.999 --> 00:57:51.835
OVERALL BUDGETARY IMPACTS THAT

00:57:51.901 --> 00:57:52.402
COULD UNDERMINE LEGISLATIVE

00:57:52.468 --> 00:57:54.404
PRIORITIES. THAT CONCLUDES MY

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:55.572

ENHANCEMENTS THAT WERE PASSED

00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:51.854
AS PART OF THE CARE IS ACTIVE

00:59:51.921 --> 00:59:53.756
AND THEN LATER PERSONALLY

EMPLOYED. THE STATE REALLY DOES

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:09.372
NOT HAVE. A ROLE IN DETERMINING

01:00:09.439 --> 01:00:11.808
HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED-

01:00:11.874 --> 01:00:12.976
THE STATE IS REALLY JUST KIND

01:00:13.042 --> 01:00:14.811
OF A PASSED THROUGH FOR THOSE

01:00:14.877 --> 01:00:16.012
FUNDS AND THAT'S WHY THEY'RE

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:17.113
INCLUDED HERE. BUT FOR THE

01:00:17.180 --> 01:00:18.881
REMAINDER OF THE GRAPHIC THIS

01:00:18.948 --> 01:00:21.117
STATE HAS VARYING DEGREES OF

01:00:21.184 --> 01:00:22.485
AUTHORITY AND ABILITY TO

01:00:22.552 --> 01:00:23.686
INFLUENCE HOW THOSE FUNDS ARE

01:00:23.753 --> 01:00:25.054
BEING SPENT AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:00:25.121 --> 01:00:27.457
IN PARTICULAR- HAS SORT OF

01:00:27.523 --> 01:00:28.658
DIFFERENT ROLES DEPENDING ON

01:00:28.725 --> 01:00:29.359
WHICH PART OF MONEY WE'RE

01:00:29.425 --> 01:00:30.760
TALKING ABOUT DESPITE THE FACT

01:00:30.827 --> 01:00:32.862
THAT. EVEN WHEN WE FOCUS ON THE

01:00:32.929 --> 01:00:34.630
REMAINING IECES. THIS IS

01:00:34.697 --> 01:00:36.766
REALLY AGAIN MOSTLY AN

01:00:36.833 --> 01:00:41.170
OVERWHELMINGLY. MAJORITY

01:00:41.237 --> 01:00:42.271
FEDERAL MONEY. SO JUST GIVE A

01:00:42.338 --> 01:00:44.574
CALL OF EGGS THE- RELIEF I ARE

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.843
C. ALFA. WELL PASSED AS PART OF

01:00:46.909 --> 01:00:48.478
THE CARE IS ACTIVE PROVIDED

01:00:48.544 --> 01:00:49.612
NINE AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS

01:00:49.679 --> 01:00:51.347
TO THE STATE. AND ON THE

01:00:51.414 --> 01:00:53.716
LEGISLATURE DID ALLOCATE SIERRA

01:00:53.783 --> 01:00:55.351
THREE WOULD BE TWENTY TWENTY

01:00:55.418 --> 01:00:56.519
TWENTY ONE BUDGET PROCESS. BUT

01:00:56.586 --> 01:00:57.787
THERE WAS ALSO CONTROL SECTION

01:00:57.854 --> 01:00:59.188
LANGUAGE THAT WAS PROVIDED AS

01:00:59.255 --> 01:01:00.323
PART OF THAT ALLOCATION

01:01:00.390 --> 01:01:01.958
ALLOWING THE ADMINISTRATION TO

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:04.494
RE DIRECT- GOT FUNDING IF IT

01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.661
WAS CLEAR THAT IT WOULD NOT BE

01:01:05.728 --> 01:01:07.330
ABLE TO BE SPENT BY THE END OF

01:01:07.397 --> 01:01:08.197
THE FISCAL YEAR WHICH IS THE

01:01:08.264 --> 01:01:09.665
DEADLINE. FOR THE FEDERAL

01:01:09.732 --> 01:01:12.635
GOVERNMENT SET FOR AND SPENDING

01:01:12.702 --> 01:01:16.005
CRF MONEY. ANOTHER IS SORT OF-

01:01:16.072 --> 01:01:17.440
IMPORTANT EXAMPLE WHEN WE THINK

01:01:17.507 --> 01:01:18.708
ABOUT A THIRTY ON THE ROLE OF

01:01:18.775 --> 01:01:20.977
THE STATE LEGISLATURE. AND THE

01:01:21.044 --> 01:01:23.112
EXECUTIVE BRANCH IS THE STATE

01:01:23.179 --> 01:01:24.347
FUNDING PIECE AND THIS IS THE

01:01:24.414 --> 01:01:26.115
PIECE THAT SEAN AND BROWN. AN

01:01:26.182 --> 01:01:27.150
IMPORTANT NOTE BEFORE I TALK

01:01:27.216 --> 01:01:29.085
ABOUT A THIRTY IS THAT. THAT

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:30.386
YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S LIFE THERE

01:01:30.453 --> 01:01:32.055
IS ABOUT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS.

01:01:32.121 --> 01:01:33.723
BUT THE ACTUAL STATE GENERAL

01:01:33.790 --> 01:01:35.425
FUND IMPLICATION OF THAT IS

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:37.260
GOING TO BE. PERHAPS A QUARTER

01:01:37.326 --> 01:01:39.162
OF THAT AMOUNT AND THE REASON

01:01:39.228 --> 01:01:40.663
THAT IT'S- THAT IT'S LOWER IS

01:01:40.730 --> 01:01:41.664
THAT THE STATE WILL EVENTUALLY

01:01:41.731 --> 01:01:45.234
BE. REIMBURSED ABOUT 75% BY THE

01:01:45.301 --> 01:01:46.069
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR THESE

01:01:46.135 --> 01:01:47.637
OUTLAYS BUT- THEY ARE STATE

01:01:47.703 --> 01:01:50.106
DIRECTED AND- THE STATE HAS.

01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:53.609
SORT OF A LOT OF DISCUSSION AND

01:01:53.676 --> 01:01:54.177
HOW TO SPEND THIS MONEY. SO

01:01:54.243 --> 01:01:55.244
THIS THIS FUNDING HAS REALLY

01:01:55.311 --> 01:01:56.579
BEEN ALLOCATED IN A COUPLE

01:01:56.646 --> 01:01:58.381
DIFFERENT WAYS BUT- PRIMARILY

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.350
THROUGH- THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH'S

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.119

01:02:21.671 --> 01:02:23.439
DIVIDED IT INTO SIX DIFFERENT

ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS

01:20:46.474 --> 01:20:47.943
TO CITIES AND COUNTIES THAT

01:20:48.009 --> 01:20:48.877
WERE BELOW THE POPULATION

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:50.579
THRESHOLD. SET BY THE US

01:20:50.645 --> 01:20:52.647
TREASURY SO IF I HEARD YOU

01:20:52.714 --> 01:20:55.283
CORRECTLY THE TWENTY TWO

01:20:55.350 --> 01:20:56.985
JURISDICTIONS IN THIS STATE

01:20:57.052 --> 01:20:59.421
CITIES AND COUNTIES ABOUT FIVE

01:20:59.487 --> 01:21:00.021
THOUSAND RECEIVE SOMEWHERE IN

01:21:00.088 --> 01:21:01.623
THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF ALMOST SIX

01:21:01.690 --> 01:21:05.794
BILLION DOLLARS. THE STATE

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.829
RECEIVED ALMOST TEN BILLION AND

01:21:07.896 --> 01:21:08.730
I'VE THAT PASSED AROUND TWO

01:21:08.797 --> 01:21:10.765
BILLION TO SMALLER TOWNS AND

01:21:10.832 --> 01:21:12.801
CITIES IS THAT. REASONABLY

01:21:12.867 --> 01:21:15.303
ACCURATE. AT THAT THAT IS

01:21:15.370 --> 01:21:16.738
CERTAINLY BETTER CERTAINLY ONE

01:21:16.805 --> 01:21:18.940
COMPONENT OF THE PASTORS TO

01:21:19.007 --> 01:21:20.041
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WE ALSO

01:21:20.108 --> 01:21:22.978
DIRECTED AT ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED

01:21:23.044 --> 01:21:25.347
FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. TO DATE

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:27.315
TO CITIES AND COUNTIES TO

01:21:27.382 --> 01:21:29.417
ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS- WHICH IS

01:21:29.484 --> 01:21:30.986
A VERY HIGH RISK POPULATION IN

01:21:31.052 --> 01:21:33.321
RELATIONSHIP TO PREVENT AND WE

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:34.789
HAVE FOUR POINT FIVE BILLION

01:21:34.856 --> 01:21:36.791
DOLLARS TO LOCAL EDUCATION

01:21:36.858 --> 01:21:39.594
AGENCY. SO THE VAST MAJORITY OF

01:21:39.661 --> 01:21:42.597
THE STATE FUNDS WENT TO

01:21:42.664 --> 01:21:43.865
JURISDICTIONS OF A LOCAL LEVEL.

01:21:43.932 --> 01:21:47.102
OKAY BUT- IT WOULD BE FAIR TO

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:49.571
POINT OUT THAT. SMALLER

01:21:49.638 --> 01:21:52.774
JURISDICTIONS GOT A PORTION OF

01:21:52.841 --> 01:21:53.341
THE NIGHT AND A HALF BILLION

01:21:53.408 --> 01:21:57.712
DOLLARS. ALONG WITH WHATEVER

01:21:57.779 --> 01:21:59.080
PORTIONS THAT MONEY WENT TO

01:21:59.147 --> 01:22:01.650
STATEWIDE INTERESTS. WILD

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:04.486
LARGER JURISDICTIONS GOT THAT

01:22:04.552 --> 01:22:05.553
SAME BENEFIT FROM NINE HALF

01:22:05.620 --> 01:22:07.522
BILLION AND ADDITIONALLY AN

01:22:07.589 --> 01:22:09.958
ADDITIONAL SIX OR FIVE POINT

01:22:10.025 --> 01:22:11.059
SIX OR FIVE POINT EIGHT I CAN

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:13.628
CALL THE NUMBER YOU CITED ON IT

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.563
CERTAINLY AT FIRST BLUSH WOULD

01:22:15.630 --> 01:22:17.165
STRIKE THIS MEMBER OF THE

01:22:17.232 --> 01:22:19.067
LEGISLATURE. THAT WE DIDN'T

01:22:19.134 --> 01:22:21.136
NECESSARILY ACTED WE DISTRIBUTE

01:22:21.202 --> 01:22:23.038
THIS MONEY THROUGHOUT THE STATE

01:22:23.104 --> 01:22:25.607
AND THAT PERHAPS SOME RURAL

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.342
JURISDICTIONS WERE IN THE

01:22:27.409 --> 01:22:29.444
POSITION TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

01:22:29.511 --> 01:22:32.414
THEIR CONSTITUENTS OR CERTAINLY

01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:36.718
AT THE- DISCRETION OF WHETHER

01:22:36.785 --> 01:22:38.019
NOT THE STATE WAS GOING TO PASS

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.387
FUNDS DOWN THROUGH THEM- IF

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:40.889
THEY ASKED FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:42.891
CERTAIN THINGS WHILE. LARGER

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:45.593
JURISDICTIONS. WERE ABLE TO

01:22:45.660 --> 01:22:46.161
MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR OWN

01:22:46.227 --> 01:22:49.431
FUNDING. THAT IS ANY PART OF

01:22:49.497 --> 01:22:49.998
WHAT I JUST SAID AND UNFAIR

01:22:50.065 --> 01:22:55.337
STATEMENT. D. B. DISTRIBUTION

01:22:55.403 --> 01:22:57.639
FAR LOCAL ENTITIES WAS INCLUDED

01:22:57.706 --> 01:22:59.174
IN THE BUDGET PASSED BY THE

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.308
LEGISLATURE AND SIGNED BY THE

01:23:00.375 --> 01:23:03.011
GOVERNOR. AND WE FEEL THAT IT

01:23:03.078 --> 01:23:04.346
IS A VERY EQUITABLE

01:23:04.412 --> 01:23:05.847
DISTRIBUTION BASED ON THE

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:09.117
CONCENTRATION OF PUBLIC PLACES.

01:23:09.184 --> 01:23:09.651
IN OUR LARGEST POPULATION

01:23:09.718 --> 01:23:12.187
CENTERS. THAT WAS BASED ON THE

01:23:12.253 --> 01:23:13.421
DATA AT THAT TIME INTERESTING

01:23:13.488 --> 01:23:16.925
SO. TO FINANCE THIS

01:23:16.991 --> 01:23:19.160
ADMINISTRATION USE ANY EQUITY

01:23:19.227 --> 01:23:20.829
METRICS TO TARGET THOSE FUNDS

01:23:20.895 --> 01:23:22.030
TO AREAS OF THE STATE FOR

01:23:22.097 --> 01:23:22.797
EXAMPLE THAT HAVE A

01:23:22.864 --> 01:23:24.666
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

01:23:24.733 --> 01:23:25.266
UNEMPLOYED OR PEOPLE LIVING IN

01:23:25.333 --> 01:23:28.570
POVERTY. THAT WOULD NOT BE

01:23:28.636 --> 01:23:30.271
ALLOCATION FORMULA THAT WAS

01:23:30.338 --> 01:23:30.905
AGREED UPON WITH THE

01:23:30.972 --> 01:23:32.941
LEGISLATURE AND THERE ARE

01:23:33.007 --> 01:23:34.743
CERTAINLY OTHER AREAS OF

01:23:34.809 --> 01:23:36.678
FUNDING THAT CAN HELP AND KIND

01:23:36.745 --> 01:23:38.046
OF ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE HIGH

01:23:38.113 --> 01:23:40.715
NEED. AND WE DID SO IN SOME OF

01:23:40.782 --> 01:23:42.417
THE CDC FUNDING THAT WAS

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:43.918
ALLOCATED TO LOCAL PUBLIC

01:23:43.985 --> 01:23:46.821
HEALTH STATISTICS. M. PURSUANT

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:48.923
TO THE- FEDERAL FUNDING THAT

01:23:48.990 --> 01:23:52.927
WAS AVAILABLE. ONE LET ME DRILL

01:23:52.994 --> 01:23:54.729
DOWN FURTHER DID WE TAKE INTO

01:23:54.796 --> 01:23:57.031
ACCOUNT IN ANY OF OUR METRICS

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:58.500
THE DEGREE TO WHICH A WORK%

01:23:58.566 --> 01:23:59.834
FORCE IN ANY PARTICULAR

01:23:59.901 --> 01:24:02.003
JURISDICTION IS CONSIDERED.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:04.539
ESSENTIAL SUCH AS- IN MY

01:24:04.606 --> 01:24:07.575
DISTRICT- MY COLLEAGUE CECILY

01:24:07.642 --> 01:24:08.743
ARE ENCOURAGED DISTRICT WE HAVE

01:24:08.810 --> 01:24:09.711
A LOT OF AGRICULTURIST BY

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.279
DISPROPORTIONATE NUMBER

01:24:11.346 --> 01:24:12.447
AGRICULTURE WORKERS WHO HAD TO

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.549
CONTINUE TO FEED THE STATE

01:24:14.616 --> 01:24:17.252
DURING THIS. ACADEMIC THIS

01:24:17.318 --> 01:24:18.219
EPIDEMIC AND I KNOW MY

01:24:18.286 --> 01:24:20.121
COLLEAGUE MISTER RANDALL FROM

01:24:20.188 --> 01:24:22.090
FRESNO APPRECIATES THAT ASPECT

01:24:22.157 --> 01:24:23.892
OF WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TOO AND

01:24:23.958 --> 01:24:25.360
I'LL TELL YOU. FROM MY

01:24:25.427 --> 01:24:26.528
PERSPECTIVE REPRESENTING A

01:24:26.594 --> 01:24:28.363
ROLLER COASTER COMMUNITY I'VE

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.532
HAD SOME COLLEAGUES. IN THIS

01:24:30.598 --> 01:24:34.369
INSTITUTION WHO HAVE TAKEN THE

01:24:34.436 --> 01:24:36.404
TIME TO PONTIFICATE. AND BE

01:24:36.471 --> 01:24:39.574
ACCUSATORY. AND YET THEY DIDN'T

01:24:39.641 --> 01:24:40.875
SEND ANY OTHER P. P. FROM SAN

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.544
DIEGO THEY DIDN'T SEND ANY

01:24:42.610 --> 01:24:46.414
THEIR MONEY FROM SAID. SO THIS

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:48.650
IS AN ISSUE I REALLY FEEL

01:24:48.716 --> 01:24:50.919
STRONGLY ABOUT IN RETROSPECT

01:24:50.985 --> 01:24:54.222
THAT WE MAKE SURE GOING FORWARD

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.124
IN EMERGENCY SITUATIONS THAT

01:24:56.191 --> 01:24:57.425
EVERY CALIFORNIAN CAN HAVE

01:24:57.492 --> 01:25:01.663
CONFIDENCE. NOT THAT THE STATE

01:25:01.729 --> 01:25:03.298
GOVERNMENT WILL THROUGH THE

01:25:03.364 --> 01:25:04.666
BUDGET PROCESS OR THE

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:07.302
ADMINISTRATION- PAST MONEY DOWN

01:25:07.368 --> 01:25:08.703
TO THEM BUT RATHER HAVE SOME

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.605
MONEY TO DEAL AND ADDRESS

01:25:10.672 --> 01:25:12.707
SERIOUS ISSUES HAPPENING AT

01:25:12.774 --> 01:25:14.609
HOME BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW WE GET

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:16.578
A PASTOR SITUATIONS THERE ARE

01:25:16.644 --> 01:25:19.047
DELAYS THERE ARE COMPLICATIONS

01:25:19.113 --> 01:25:22.584
THERE IS BUREAUCRACY. AND

01:25:22.650 --> 01:25:25.253
HOPEFULLY WHEN ELLIE- GETS US

01:25:25.320 --> 01:25:27.555
SOME INFORMATION ON OR AT LEAST

01:25:27.622 --> 01:25:29.290
THE BEST INFORMATION WE HAVE OF

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:31.292
HOW EQUITABLE THESE FUNDS HAVE

01:25:31.359 --> 01:25:35.563
BEEN. WE CAN DEVELOP AUTOMATION

01:25:35.630 --> 01:25:36.965
SOME METRICS GOING FORWARD THEY

01:25:37.031 --> 01:25:38.299
WOULD MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF OUR

01:25:38.366 --> 01:25:40.001
CONSTITUENTS ARE TREATED.

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:43.204
FAIRLY AS FUNDING GOES BECAUSE

01:25:43.271 --> 01:25:45.039
WE ALL KNOW NOT BEING PREPARED

01:25:45.106 --> 01:25:47.909
GOING INTO DISASTERS WHEN-

01:25:47.976 --> 01:25:48.743
WE'RE MAKING IT UP AS WE GO

01:25:48.810 --> 01:25:51.412
AND- THAT'SWHEN POLITICS%

01:25:51.479 --> 01:25:53.481
INSERTS ITS UGLY HEAD INTO

01:25:53.548 --> 01:25:55.483
POLICY AND WE END UP WITH. THE

01:25:55.550 --> 01:25:56.851
COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE TO

01:25:56.918 --> 01:25:57.919
HAVE THE LARGEST POLITICAL

01:25:57.986 --> 01:26:01.990
POWER- GETTING THE LION'S SHARE

01:26:02.056 --> 01:26:03.324
THE RESOURCES ALL LIVE. IN MY

01:26:03.391 --> 01:26:04.626
TIME THAT THE COMMITTEE MISTER

01:26:04.692 --> 01:26:05.860
CHAIRMAN AND PASS IT ON TO THE

01:26:05.927 --> 01:26:07.295
NEXT MEMBER. THANKS MISTER

01:26:07.362 --> 01:26:11.165
MONTE. I THANK YOU MISTER

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:12.734
CHAIRMAN I HAD A QUESTION FOR

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:16.037
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND.

01:26:16.104 --> 01:26:17.171
THERE HAS BEEN YOU KNOW

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:18.206
OBVIOUSLY OVER THE LAST COUPLE

01:26:18.273 --> 01:26:19.507
MONTHS A LOT OF FRUSTRATION THE

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:21.442
LEGISLATURE ABOUT THE LACK OF

01:26:21.509 --> 01:26:24.746
LEGISLATIVE INVOLVEMENT IN

01:26:24.812 --> 01:26:27.015
DECIDING HOW THESE OF FUNDS ARE

01:26:27.081 --> 01:26:29.250
DISTRIBUTED AND- IN

01:26:29.317 --> 01:26:31.052
PARTICIPATING IN THE STATE'S

01:26:31.119 --> 01:26:33.421
RESPONSE. M. A. R. I THINK THAT

01:26:33.488 --> 01:26:34.756
THE LEGISLATURE WAS VERY CLEAR

01:26:34.822 --> 01:26:36.391
WHEN WE PASSED SB EIGHTY NINE A

01:26:36.457 --> 01:26:38.326
FEW MONTHS AGO. THE DELEGATION

01:26:38.393 --> 01:26:39.060
OF AUTHORITY THAT WE WERE

01:26:39.127 --> 01:26:42.764
GIVING TO THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH

01:26:42.830 --> 01:26:44.265
THERE WERE CERTAIN KINDS OF IS

01:26:44.332 --> 01:26:45.533
THE SPENDING AUTHORITY THAT WE

01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:48.403
RECOGNIZE LEGISLATIVE PRINT THE

01:26:48.469 --> 01:26:49.637
THERE ARE OTHER KINDS OF

01:26:49.704 --> 01:26:50.738
RESPONSE FUNDING THAT WE WANTED

01:26:50.805 --> 01:26:52.640
TO BE A PART OF IT

01:26:52.707 --> 01:26:53.274
UNFORTUNATELY THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:26:53.341 --> 01:26:55.243
FINANCE. IS REALLY NOT GIVEN

01:26:55.310 --> 01:26:56.678
THE LEGISLATURE THAT ROLE I

01:26:56.744 --> 01:26:58.246
MEAN WE'VE GOT A REPORTING

01:26:58.313 --> 01:27:01.182
REQUIREMENT. THE EXECUTIVE

01:27:01.249 --> 01:27:03.484
BRANCH HAS BEEN REPORTING THE

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:04.485
LEGISLATURE WHEN SPENDING

01:27:04.552 --> 01:27:06.387
DECISIONS ARE MADE BUT NOT

01:27:06.454 --> 01:27:08.556
INVOLVING THE LEGISLATURE IN

01:27:08.623 --> 01:27:09.724
MAKING THOSE SPENDING DECISIONS

01:27:09.791 --> 01:27:11.326
SO THE L. A. ALWAYS LAID OUT

01:27:11.392 --> 01:27:13.161
SOME PRETTY STARK. OPTIONS FOR

01:27:13.227 --> 01:27:16.831
US WE COULD- WE COULD PASS A

01:27:16.898 --> 01:27:18.533
RESOLUTION TO END THE

01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:20.068
DECLARATION OF EMERGENCY THAT

01:27:20.134 --> 01:27:20.702
WOULD BE ONE THING WE COULD DO

01:27:20.768 --> 01:27:22.203
PRETTY DRACONIAN- WE COULD

01:27:22.270 --> 01:27:23.871
CHANGE STATE LAW TO MAKE SURE

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:24.472
THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN

01:27:24.539 --> 01:27:26.741
IN THE FUTURE EMERGENCY- BUT

01:27:26.808 --> 01:27:28.876
I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT. THE

01:27:28.943 --> 01:27:30.011
DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY RIGHT

01:27:30.078 --> 01:27:31.613
NOW AND SO MY QUESTION FOR THE

01:27:31.679 --> 01:27:33.514
DELAY OFFICE DO YOU UNDERSTAND

01:27:33.581 --> 01:27:35.049
WHY WE ARE SO FRUSTRATED ABOUT

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:37.619
THIS AND WHAT WHAT CAN WE DO TO

01:27:37.685 --> 01:27:40.188
BE MORE OF A PARTNER WITH YOU.

01:27:40.254 --> 01:27:44.359
IN MAKING SPENDING DECISIONS.

01:27:44.425 --> 01:27:45.827
ACTRESS HEATHER OR DEPARTMENT

01:27:45.893 --> 01:27:49.197
FINANCE AGAIN. AND WE HAVE BEEN

01:27:49.263 --> 01:27:50.665
REPORTING AND PROVIDING

01:27:50.732 --> 01:27:52.634
NOTIFICATION LETTERS AS NOTED

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.068
CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING LAW

01:27:54.135 --> 01:27:55.503
WE'VE ALSO BEEN PROVIDING

01:27:55.570 --> 01:27:58.373
FISCAL UPDATES- AS FAR BACK AS

01:27:58.439 --> 01:28:00.041
WHEN CONTROL SECTIONS OF. THIS

THOUGHT THE LEGISLATURE WAS

01:29:08.743 --> 01:29:10.978
VERY CLEAR WHEN WE PASSED SB

01:29:11.045 --> 01:29:12.113
EIGHTY NINE IN ARTICULATING THE

INVOLVED IN THOSE DECISIONS.

01:29:23.191 --> 01:29:23.891
BECAUSE WE HAVE A

01:29:23.958 --> 01:29:25.793
CONSTITUTIONAL- A

01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:27.595
CONSTITUTIONAL OBLIGATION TO

01:29:27.662 --> 01:29:29.197
NOT ONLY KNOW ABOUT THE

01:29:29.263 --> 01:29:34.802

CONTINUE THIS DISCUSSION WHICH

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:49.417
I THINK. IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO

01:29:49.484 --> 01:29:50.218
THE DISCUSSIONS WE ARE HAVING

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:52.453

THAT WE NEED TO BE

01:30:06.768 --> 01:30:09.303
INTROSPECTIVE ABOUT BECAUSE-

01:30:09.370 --> 01:30:10.872
THIS WILL NOT BE THE LAST TIME

01:30:10.938 --> 01:30:12.273
THAT WE HAVE. THE KIND OF

01:30:12.340 --> 01:30:13.608
EMERGENCY THAT REQUIRES THIS

01:30:13.674 --> 01:30:15.243
KIND OF SHARED OVERSIGHT

01:30:15.309 --> 01:30:17.078
RESPONSIBILITY AND I THINK WE

01:30:17.145 --> 01:30:18.346
NEED TO WORK THESE KINKS OUT SO

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:19.213
THEY WERE BETTER PREPARED NEXT

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.249
TIME. BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN VERY

01:30:21.315 --> 01:30:23.384
FRUSTRATED ABOUT. ABOUT OUR

01:30:23.451 --> 01:30:25.153
LACK OF IN OF INVOLVEMENT IN

01:30:25.219 --> 01:30:27.221
MAKING THESE DECISIONS AND- AND

01:30:27.288 --> 01:30:29.023
REALLY FEELING LIKE- THAT'S

01:30:29.090 --> 01:30:32.260
SOMETHING THAT THE LEGISLATURE

01:30:32.326 --> 01:30:32.760
HAS AN OBLIGATION TO BE

01:30:32.827 --> 01:30:33.761
INVOLVED IN AND THEN THE KIND

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:35.196
OF A SIMILAR QUESTION FOR THE-

01:30:35.263 --> 01:30:37.231
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST OFFICE IF

01:30:37.298 --> 01:30:38.800

IS A LEGISLATORS THAT WE COULD

01:30:47.909 --> 01:30:50.444
TAKE TO TRY TO VOTE ENGAGE MORE

01:30:50.511 --> 01:30:52.446
IN THIS PROCESS- BUT I'M

01:30:52.513 --> 01:30:53.414
WONDERING IF THERE IS NO MIDDLE

01:30:53.481 --> 01:30:55.116
GROUND BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY

01:30:55.183 --> 01:30:57.351
ENDING THE DECLARATION OF THE

01:30:57.418 --> 01:30:58.920

01:30:58.986 --> 01:31:01.756
REPERCUSSIONS BEYOND JUST THE-

01:31:01.823 --> 01:31:04.725

KIND OF MIDDLE GROUND OBVIOUSLY

CHANGING STATE LAW WOULD APPLY

01:31:10.998 --> 01:31:12.099
TO FUTURE EMERGENCIES NOT TO

01:31:12.166 --> 01:31:14.101
THIS ONE AND WOULD REQUIRE YOU

01:31:14.168 --> 01:31:14.669
KNOW THE CONCURRENCE OF THE

01:31:14.735 --> 01:31:16.437
EXECUTIVE BRANCH- WOULD WHEN WE

01:31:16.504 --> 01:31:18.105

THERE ARE WAYS THAT. THE L. A.

01:31:20.641 --> 01:31:23.110
O. HAS A HAS MAYBE THOUGHT OF.

01:31:23.177 --> 01:31:24.745
THAT WE COULD FIX THIS PROCESS

01:31:24.812 --> 01:31:26.514
AND MORE INVOLVED THE

01:31:26.581 --> 01:31:27.114

pABLE TO RESPOND TO THE

01:31:54.809 --> 01:31:55.343

THE WELL AS WHAT IS PLANNED FOR

01:32:55.236 --> 01:32:57.538
THE FUTURE I'M IS EXACTLY THE

01:32:57.605 --> 01:32:58.539
KIND OF INFORMATION THE

01:32:58.606 --> 01:33:01.676
LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE ABLE.

01:33:01.742 --> 01:33:03.077
TO ENGAGE MEANINGFULLY WITH THE

01:33:03.144 --> 01:33:04.178
ADMINISTRATION THROUGH

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.080
OVERSIGHT HEARINGS OR OTHER-

01:33:06.147 --> 01:33:07.915
AVENUES THAT YOU HAVE THAT

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:09.317
WITHOUT HAVING THAT INFORMATION

01:33:09.383 --> 01:33:11.118
OF WHAT HAS BEEN SPENT AND WHAT

01:33:11.185 --> 01:33:13.254
THEY PLAN TO SPEND. YOU DON'T

01:33:13.321 --> 01:33:14.355
EVEN HAVE THE BASE INFORMATION

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:18.392
THAT- IS REALLY NECESSARY FOR-

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:19.293
REALLY STRONG LEGISLATIVE

01:33:19.360 --> 01:33:21.062
ENGAGEMENT HI I'M IN THIS

01:33:21.128 --> 01:33:22.463

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:24.432
IMPACTFUL MEANINGFUL CONSISTENT

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:27.101
WAY. AND SO AND YOU KNOW THAT'S

01:33:27.168 --> 01:33:30.905
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE RAISE.

01:33:30.972 --> 01:33:31.472
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IS

01:33:31.539 --> 01:33:32.039
COMMITTED TO PROVIDING THESE

01:33:32.106 --> 01:33:33.174
ARE PER ON A MONTH BASIS. AND

01:33:33.240 --> 01:33:35.409
THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED YET YOU

01:33:35.476 --> 01:33:37.078
KNOW THEY'RE WORKING TOWARDS IT

01:33:37.144 --> 01:33:39.180
AND IT'S COMPLICATED BUT- I'M

01:33:39.246 --> 01:33:40.014
IS GOING TO BE IMPORTANT FOR

01:33:40.081 --> 01:33:41.082
YOU TO UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE

01:33:41.148 --> 01:33:42.783
NOT ABLE TO DO THIS- AND WATER

01:33:42.850 --> 01:33:44.885
THOSE CHALLENGES AND WHAT STEPS

01:33:44.952 --> 01:33:46.754
NEED TO BE TAKEN. TO OVERCOME

01:33:46.821 --> 01:33:48.789
THOSE CHALLENGES ARE BECAUSE

01:33:48.856 --> 01:33:50.191
JUST HAVING THAT THAT BASELINE

01:33:50.257 --> 01:33:52.059
OF INFORMATION IS REALLY THE

01:33:52.126 --> 01:33:54.061
FIRST I'M NECESSARY STOP. I'M

01:33:54.128 --> 01:33:55.663
IN OVERSIGHT AND ENSURING THAT

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.565
IT SHOWS WHAT THEY SPENT AND

01:33:57.631 --> 01:33:58.566
WHAT WHAT ARE SOME THE OUTCOMES

01:33:58.632 --> 01:34:00.101
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AND WHAT

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:02.036
THEY'RE PLANNING TO DO AND WHAT

01:34:02.103 --> 01:34:02.803
ARE SOME OF THE EXPECTED

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.505
OUTCOMES ASSOCIATED WITH THAT.

01:34:04.572 --> 01:34:05.873
I JUST UNDERSTANDING THAT IS

01:34:05.940 --> 01:34:07.108
GOING TO ALLOW FOR A LOT MORE

01:34:07.174 --> 01:34:09.243
AND MEANINGFUL INVOLVEMENT OF

01:34:09.310 --> 01:34:11.412
THE LEGISLATURE. I'M IN TERMS

LEGISLATURE. THAT'S NOT THE WAY

01:34:17.852 --> 01:34:19.286
THE FUNDING IS CONSTRUCTED ON

01:34:19.353 --> 01:34:20.821
IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET BUT

01:34:20.888 --> 01:34:22.023
THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT

01:34:22.089 --> 01:34:22.723
YOU COULD THINK ABOUT GOING

01:34:22.790 --> 01:34:24.759
FORWARD. I'M EITHER CHANGING

01:34:24.825 --> 01:34:25.593
THE STRUCTURE OF EMERGENCY

01:34:25.659 --> 01:34:27.928

IN SOME CASES BY HUNDREDS OF

01:37:53.300 --> 01:37:54.935
MILLIONS OR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:37:55.002 --> 01:37:56.470
AND SO THINGS ARE OBVIOUSLY

01:37:56.537 --> 01:37:58.472
INVOLVING RICK VERY RAPIDLY AND

01:37:58.539 --> 01:38:02.076
AS- WE LEARN MORE ABOUT ON KOBE

01:38:02.142 --> 01:38:03.310

01:38:03.377 --> 01:38:04.945
FURTHER DEVELOPS ITS PLANS TO

TIMELY INFORMATION AND THE

01:38:18.392 --> 01:38:20.027
OTHER THING IS IT WOULD BE VERY

01:38:20.094 --> 01:38:22.229
IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. I'M IN

01:38:22.296 --> 01:38:23.664
THESE UPDATES IT'S COMBINING

01:38:23.731 --> 01:38:24.999
FUNDING FROM LAST FISCAL YEAR

01:38:25.065 --> 01:38:26.433
WITH PLANNED FUNDING FOR THIS

01:38:26.500 --> 01:38:28.269
FISCAL YEAR IT'S UNCLEAR HOW

REMAINS. I'M WHAT DOES ASK HIM

01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:33.907

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:35.342
END OF THE FISCAL YEAR AND THEN

01:38:35.409 --> 01:38:36.377

01:38:36.443 --> 01:38:38.445
OUTCOMES AND A LOT OF FINDINGS

01:38:38.512 --> 01:38:40.447
BEEN SPENT ON PROCUREMENT OF

01:38:40.514 --> 01:38:41.749

WHICH OF TALK ABOUT IN THE NEXT

01:38:42.983 --> 01:38:44.585
PANEL. BUT HOW MUCH HAS BEEN

01:38:44.652 --> 01:38:45.853
SPENT AND WHAT WAS PURCHASED

01:38:45.919 --> 01:38:48.222
FOR THAT AND- HOW MUCH REMAINS

01:38:49.556 --> 01:38:50.758
QUESTIONS IT'S NOT REALLY CLEAR

01:38:50.824 --> 01:38:52.960
FROM THOSE UPDATES- AND SO

01:38:53.027 --> 01:38:54.928
GETTING FATTER INFORMATION AND

01:38:54.995 --> 01:38:57.231

01:39:03.604 --> 01:39:05.606
CERTAIN CONSISTENCY WITH THE

REPORT SO THAT. YOU CAN COMPARE

01:39:11.478 --> 01:39:12.046
MONTH TO MONTH AT THIS POINT IT

01:39:12.112 --> 01:39:13.914
SEEMS LIKE THE DATA JOHN. A BIT

01:39:13.981 --> 01:39:14.481
OF ALL OF THE PLACE SO IT'S

01:39:14.548 --> 01:39:17.685

01:39:20.654 --> 01:39:22.823
BETWEEN AUGUST AND NOVEMBER.

01:39:22.890 --> 01:39:24.058

REST OF THE FISCAL YEAR SO

01:39:33.467 --> 01:39:34.301
THAT'S GOING TO BE REALLY

01:39:34.368 --> 01:39:35.569
IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE

01:39:35.636 --> 01:39:38.005
TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IF WE SPENT

01:39:38.072 --> 01:39:39.006
WHAT DID THAT GET US WHAT WE

01:41:09.530 --> 01:41:12.166
DUMPED. BUT AS AS YOU MENTIONED

01:41:12.232 --> 01:41:14.134
MAYBE IT'S- TO HIGH LEVEL NOT

01:41:14.201 --> 01:41:16.670
SPECIFIC ENOUGH. IT'S ALSO

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:20.140
DIFFICULT TO DISCERN. SO I'LL

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:21.642
JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE I MEAN

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:25.212
WE COULD GIVE ANYBODY. YOU KNOW

01:41:25.279 --> 01:41:26.880
MILLIONS OF DATA POINTS BUT

01:41:26.947 --> 01:41:27.948
FRANKLY IT DOESN'T TELL US

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:30.350
ANYTHING UNLESS YOU ACTUALLY

01:41:30.417 --> 01:41:33.287
SYNTHESIZE IT AND CAN COMPARE-

01:41:33.353 --> 01:41:35.989
INFORMATION. SO IF YOU KNOW FOR

01:41:36.056 --> 01:41:39.293
EXAMPLE- HERE WE ARE WE HAVE A

01:41:39.359 --> 01:41:40.360
PROBLEM AT THE UNIVERSITY

01:41:40.427 --> 01:41:44.798
CALIFORNIA THE UNIVERSITY.

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:45.365
CALIFORNIA JUST GIVE EXAMPLE

01:41:45.432 --> 01:41:45.966
EVERY YEAR. THEY WERE PASS A

01:41:46.033 --> 01:41:48.035
BUDGET. BUT THEY NEVER. ENTERED

01:41:48.101 --> 01:41:48.936
THE REGENTS WHAT THE ACTUALLY

01:41:49.002 --> 01:41:50.871
SPEND MONEY ON TO EVERY YEAR

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.072
THEY GO THIS YEAR'S BUDGET WAS

01:41:52.139 --> 01:41:53.340
THIS AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET

01:41:53.407 --> 01:41:55.309
WITH THIS BUT NO ONE EVER TOLD

01:41:55.375 --> 01:41:55.809
THEM WHAT. WHAT WHAT WAS

01:41:55.876 --> 01:41:58.345
ACTUALLY SPENT. SO I THINK WHAT

01:41:58.412 --> 01:42:01.215
WE'RE- SAYING TO YOU IS- IN

01:42:01.281 --> 01:42:02.449
YOUR MIND YOU'RE GIVING US

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:06.253
INFORMATION. WHAT WE'RE SAYING

01:42:06.320 --> 01:42:07.321
IT'S HARD TO COMMUNICATE IS

01:42:07.387 --> 01:42:09.089
THAT THE INFORMATION IN THE

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:11.658
FORMAT IS PRESENTED MAY MAKE

01:42:11.725 --> 01:42:14.061
YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR MEETING YOUR

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:16.563
LEGAL OBLIGATIONS. BUT IT

01:42:16.630 --> 01:42:18.799
REALLY DOESN'T FOR FILL THE

01:42:18.866 --> 01:42:21.235
TRANSPARENCY IN THE DEMOCRATIC

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:22.736
IN THE OPEN THIS OBLIGATION

01:42:22.803 --> 01:42:25.172
THAT WE HAVE AN OPEN SOCIETY.

01:42:25.239 --> 01:42:25.772
SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:42:25.839 --> 01:42:28.742
TRYING TO ASK IF YOU CAN WORK

01:42:28.809 --> 01:42:32.312
WITH THE L. A. O. TO. GET THE

01:42:32.379 --> 01:42:35.616
REPORT FORMAT THAT- IS A LITTLE

01:42:35.682 --> 01:42:38.018
MORE LOW LEVEL A LITTLE MORE

01:42:38.085 --> 01:42:39.853
INFORMATIVE IT'S SOMETHING THAT

01:42:39.920 --> 01:42:43.423
IS- MORE EASILY DIGESTIBLE.

01:42:43.490 --> 01:42:45.259
BECAUSE JUST AS AS I'M ON THE

01:42:45.325 --> 01:42:46.760
RECEIVING END OF THESE LETTERS

01:42:46.827 --> 01:42:48.862
THERE'S JUST SORT OF LIKE. DOES

01:42:48.929 --> 01:42:50.564
SHE JUST- IT'S JUST PAPER JUST

01:42:50.631 --> 01:42:52.599
COMING THROUGH THE DESK IT

01:42:52.666 --> 01:42:55.903
DOESN'T REALLY. MEANS THAT MUCH

01:42:55.969 --> 01:42:57.905
FROM AN OVERALL PICTURE. SO I

01:42:57.971 --> 01:42:59.373
THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:42:59.439 --> 01:43:01.508
TO CONTINUE TO WORK ON AND WHAT

01:43:01.575 --> 01:43:03.076
WE WHAT WE UNDERSTAND IN THE

01:43:03.143 --> 01:43:04.144
SPRING WE WERE STILL STRUGGLING

01:43:04.211 --> 01:43:07.114
JUST TO CONTAIN THINGS NOW THAT

01:43:07.180 --> 01:43:09.216
AT LEAST HAS THE STATE HAS HAD

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:10.217
SOME SUCCESSES WOULD HAVE

01:43:10.284 --> 01:43:12.386
MANAGING AS BEST AS WE COULD

01:43:12.452 --> 01:43:13.854
THE PANDEMIC. IT WOULD BE

01:43:13.921 --> 01:43:16.857
HELPFUL TO TAKE THE TIME TO

01:43:16.924 --> 01:43:18.292
MAKE SURE THAT WERE TAKEN A

01:43:18.358 --> 01:43:20.227
LOOK BACK AND MAKING SURE THAT

01:43:20.294 --> 01:43:22.462
WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT WHAT

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:23.030
WAS SPENT AND THEN TRY TO

01:43:23.096 --> 01:43:25.933
FIGURE OUT WHAT. WHAT WE PLAN

01:43:25.999 --> 01:43:28.068
ON SPENDING MOVING FORWARD.

01:43:28.135 --> 01:43:30.037
YEAH I KNOW WHERE I AM. ALWAYS

01:43:30.103 --> 01:43:31.238
ALWAYS HAPPY TO KEEP TALKING

01:43:31.305 --> 01:43:33.607
THE WITH THE L. A. L. WE HAVE I

01:43:33.674 --> 01:43:35.108
JUST I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:35.809
WE HAVE INVOLVED IN THE

01:43:35.876 --> 01:43:38.679
REPORTING SO WE DO HAVE- MORE.

01:43:38.745 --> 01:43:40.347
MORE LINES AND MORE SPECIFICITY

01:43:40.414 --> 01:43:42.416
THAN WHEN WE STARTED SO WE ALSO

01:43:42.482 --> 01:43:43.650
CONTINUE TO REFINE HOW WE

01:43:43.717 --> 01:43:45.886
PRESENT IT TO MAKE IT. AS

01:43:45.953 --> 01:43:47.087
USEFUL AS POSSIBLE AND FIND

01:43:47.154 --> 01:43:48.322
THAT BALANCE OF LIKE YOU SAID

01:43:48.388 --> 01:43:50.757
BE DIGESTIBLE- BUT ALSO HAVING

01:43:50.824 --> 01:43:51.959
THE INFORMATION THE FOLKS ARE

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:53.994
LOOKING FOR SO. AND WE'LL

01:43:54.061 --> 01:43:55.362
CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:57.297
DON'T CONTINUE- AS WE WORK ON

01:43:57.364 --> 01:43:59.199
IT HURT TO REFINE THAT FORMAT

01:43:59.266 --> 01:44:01.768
AND SEE WHAT. IS THAT AT A

01:44:01.835 --> 01:44:03.170
HELPFUL WAY TO COMMUNICATE THAT

01:44:03.236 --> 01:44:04.905
INFORMATION AND THEN IF IT IF

01:44:04.972 --> 01:44:06.406
YOU FOR THAT AGAIN. I MEAN WHAT

01:44:06.473 --> 01:44:08.241
WE HOPE IS THAT THESE CHANGES

01:44:08.308 --> 01:44:10.110
BE COMMUNICATED BETWEEN FINANCE

01:44:10.177 --> 01:44:12.045
AND L. A. ALL IN. THAT WE DON'T

01:44:12.112 --> 01:44:13.747
HAVE TO HAVE. IT OVERSIGHT

01:44:13.814 --> 01:44:15.515
HEARING I THINK A LITTLE BIT OF

01:44:15.582 --> 01:44:17.651
OUR FRUSTRATION IT FEELS LIKE-

01:44:17.718 --> 01:44:19.353

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:20.821
SERIOUSLY UNTIL WE START

01:44:20.887 --> 01:44:21.655
SCHEDULING OVERSIGHT HEARING

01:44:21.722 --> 01:44:25.025

01:44:27.127 --> 01:44:28.495

02:01:48.934 --> 02:01:50.569
THAT ABSOLUTELY THE FOCUS AND

02:01:50.636 --> 02:01:52.705
REALLY AKA A CORE COMPONENT OF

02:01:52.772 --> 02:01:53.639
THE ORGANIZATION IS TO LOOK

02:01:53.706 --> 02:01:55.574
AHEAD- WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S

02:01:55.641 --> 02:01:56.642
CALLED ADVANCE PLANNING LOOKING

02:01:56.709 --> 02:01:58.611
DOWN THE HORIZON- I'M NOT

02:01:58.678 --> 02:02:00.513
TRYING TO. MINIMIZE OR

02:02:00.579 --> 02:02:02.148
MARGINALIZE THE INCREDIBLE

02:02:02.214 --> 02:02:03.883
IMPACT IN EVERY CORNER OF OUR

02:02:03.949 --> 02:02:05.484
SOCIETY THAT IS AFFECTED BY

02:02:05.551 --> 02:02:07.219
THIS DISEASE IN THE DECISION

02:02:07.286 --> 02:02:09.355
MAKING- THAT WE DO NOW AND HOW

02:02:09.422 --> 02:02:11.590
THAT AFFECTS LATER- BUT WE-

02:02:11.657 --> 02:02:13.125
ABSOLUTELY ARE ARE LOOKING

02:02:13.192 --> 02:02:14.894
AHEAD AND WE HOPE THAT WE CAN

02:02:14.960 --> 02:02:17.697
CONTINUE TO FIND WAYS TO- TO

02:02:17.763 --> 02:02:18.964
WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO

02:02:19.031 --> 02:02:19.999
TALK ABOUT TALK THROUGH THAT

02:02:20.066 --> 02:02:21.467
TOGETHER I KNOW WE'VE HAD.

02:02:21.534 --> 02:02:23.436
SEVERAL FORUMS AN UPDATE

02:02:23.502 --> 02:02:25.471
SPECIALIZED- DISCUSSIONS AND IF

02:02:25.538 --> 02:02:27.106
ENOUGH ADVANCE PLANNING IS ONE

02:02:27.173 --> 02:02:30.109
OF THEM THEN WE'RE OPEN TO- TO

02:02:30.176 --> 02:02:31.677
HAVING A DIALOGUE ABOUT THAT

02:02:31.744 --> 02:02:33.813
BUT- YOU KNOW ART OUR JOB BACK

02:02:33.879 --> 02:02:35.614
HELLO YES IS ALSO TO MANAGE THE

02:02:35.681 --> 02:02:37.349
RECOVERY FROM DISASTERS NOT

02:02:37.416 --> 02:02:40.352
JUST THE RESPONSE AND- MAYBE

02:02:40.419 --> 02:02:42.021
THAT MANIFESTS TRADITIONALLY

02:02:42.088 --> 02:02:43.889
AND THINGS LIKE WILDFIRES IN

02:02:43.956 --> 02:02:44.724
THE REBUILDING AND DEBRIS

02:02:44.790 --> 02:02:47.193
CLEANUP- BUT CERTAINLY IT COMES

02:02:47.259 --> 02:02:49.829
INTO PLAY HERE- IT IS JUST- NOT

02:02:49.895 --> 02:02:50.996
SOMETHING THAT IS TYPICAL AND

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:52.998
BY ANY STRETCH AND LOOKING AT.

02:02:53.065 --> 02:02:55.434
THAT YOU KNOW ECONOMIC RECOVERY

02:02:55.501 --> 02:02:56.869
AND KEEPING THEM IN MIND ALL OF

02:02:56.936 --> 02:02:59.371
THE ELEMENTS THAT AFFECT PEOPLE

02:02:59.438 --> 02:03:01.340
IN THIS TYPE OF EVENTS BEYOND

02:03:01.407 --> 02:03:02.708
THE HEALTH AND THAT'S EXACTLY

02:03:02.775 --> 02:03:05.978
WHAT OUR ROLE IS TO DRAW IN THE

02:03:06.045 --> 02:03:08.047
US THE ALL OF THE ELEMENTS OF

02:03:08.114 --> 02:03:09.949
STATE GOVERNMENT- BRING IN THE

02:03:10.015 --> 02:03:11.984
FEDERAL RESOURCES AND

02:03:12.051 --> 02:03:13.686
IMPORTANTLY MOST IMPORTANTLY

02:03:13.753 --> 02:03:15.087
WORK WITH OUR COMMUNITIES WE

02:03:15.154 --> 02:03:16.388
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:17.523
WHICH ARE VERY UNIQUE ACROSS

02:03:17.590 --> 02:03:20.826
CALIFORNIA. AND DO THAT WORK IN

02:03:20.893 --> 02:03:22.328
REAL TIME AND ALSO LOOKING

02:03:22.394 --> 02:03:24.764
AHEAD SO- MAYBE THAT ISN'T

02:03:24.830 --> 02:03:25.631
SPECIFICALLY ANSWER THE

02:03:25.698 --> 02:03:26.732
QUESTION ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:28.367
DOCUMENT A PIECE OF PAPER BUT-

02:03:28.434 --> 02:03:29.635
THE FACT THAT OF ADVANCE

02:03:29.702 --> 02:03:33.005
PLANNING A LOOKING AHEAD IT AT

02:03:33.072 --> 02:03:34.406
WHAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO. DO

02:03:34.473 --> 02:03:35.641
IN ORDER TO ALTERNATELY OVER

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:37.309
COMMON AND MOVE FORWARD FROM

02:03:37.376 --> 02:03:39.145
THIS. THIS PARTICULAR BAND IS

02:03:39.211 --> 02:03:40.880
AS IMPORTANT AS WHAT WE'RE

02:03:40.946 --> 02:03:42.681
DOING IN REAL TIME IMMEDIATELY

02:03:42.748 --> 02:03:44.416
TO RESPOND- TO THINGS ARE

02:03:44.483 --> 02:03:46.152
CHANGING EVERY DAY. IN TERMS OF

02:03:46.218 --> 02:03:48.020
CASES AND HOW WE'RE SUPPORTING

02:03:48.087 --> 02:03:49.588
OUR COMMUNITIES TO MANAGE THOSE

02:03:49.655 --> 02:03:52.024
SO. I'M JUST HAPPY TO. TO I

02:03:52.091 --> 02:03:53.759
TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AND HOW WE

02:03:53.826 --> 02:03:56.328
CAN AND DOES COMMUNICATE AND

02:03:56.395 --> 02:03:58.664
COORDINATE. IN THAT AREA IN THE

02:03:58.731 --> 02:03:59.865
FUTURE AND I DON'T KNOW SUSAN

02:03:59.932 --> 02:04:01.000
HAS ANYTHING TO ADD BUT SHE'S

02:04:01.066 --> 02:04:03.235
HERE IN THE- ROOM. WITH ME AS

02:04:03.302 --> 02:04:12.378
WELL. I WOULD JUST ADD THAT THE

02:04:12.444 --> 02:04:14.313
BLUEPRINTS IF. THAT THE

02:04:14.380 --> 02:04:16.115
BLUEPRINT THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

02:04:16.182 --> 02:04:18.150
IS DESIGNED TO HELP US TO.

02:04:18.217 --> 02:04:19.885
REALLY UNDERSTAND THE IMPACTS

02:04:19.952 --> 02:04:22.154
AND TO LOOK AT. BOTH THE HEALTH

02:04:22.221 --> 02:04:23.956
AND- PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH

02:04:24.023 --> 02:04:25.825
CARE IMPACTS ON SO AS WE LOOK

02:04:25.891 --> 02:04:28.727
THROUGH. THAT PLAN OF HOW WE-

02:04:28.794 --> 02:04:29.795
USE SURVEILLANCE AND

02:04:29.862 --> 02:04:31.497
EPIDEMIOLOGY TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:04:31.564 --> 02:04:33.799
DISEASE TRANSMISSION. AND

02:04:33.866 --> 02:04:35.901
PEOPLE COUNTIES MOVE FROM TIER

02:04:35.968 --> 02:04:37.636
FORWARD OR BACK BASED ON THAT

02:04:37.703 --> 02:04:39.538
TRANSMISSION CASE RATE AND-

02:04:39.605 --> 02:04:41.273
TEST POSITIVITY OF TWELVE WELL

02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:42.908
OTHER HEALTH EQUITY MEASURE.

02:04:42.975 --> 02:04:44.276
THAT THAT TYPE TRAITS THE

02:04:44.343 --> 02:04:46.412
ABILITY TO REALLY CONTROL ON

02:04:46.478 --> 02:04:47.546
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE

02:04:47.613 --> 02:04:49.148
DISEASE AND AS YOU KNOW WE'RE

02:04:49.215 --> 02:04:51.217
SEEING. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN AN

02:04:51.283 --> 02:04:52.484
INCREASE IN CASES AND

02:04:52.551 --> 02:04:54.320
HOSPITALIZATIONS RIGHT NOW. AND

02:04:54.386 --> 02:04:56.088
SO REALLY PLANNING FOR THAT AND

02:04:56.155 --> 02:04:58.190
REALLY PUTTING IN PERSPECTIVE-

02:04:58.257 --> 02:04:59.758
ALL OF THOSE PIECES THAT NEED

02:04:59.825 --> 02:05:02.161
TO BE IN PLACE FROM. THE APTIAN

02:05:02.228 --> 02:05:03.495
SURVEILLANCE TO TESTING TO

02:05:03.562 --> 02:05:07.199
CONTACT TRACING. AND THEN ON TO

02:05:07.266 --> 02:05:08.434
VACCINE PLANNING. WHEN I

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:09.768
STARTED I HAD BROUGHT UP FDR

02:05:09.835 --> 02:05:12.204
BECAUSE I REALLY BELIEVE HE

02:05:12.271 --> 02:05:13.372
HELPED US THROUGH THE GREAT

02:05:13.439 --> 02:05:14.974
DEPRESSION TO LOOK TOWARDS THE

02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:17.443
SOCIAL SAFETY NET AS- SOMETHING

02:05:17.509 --> 02:05:19.378
THAT HELPED OUR COUNTRY DURING

02:05:19.445 --> 02:05:21.447
TIMES OF THE DAY. AND SO MY

02:05:21.513 --> 02:05:24.450
QUESTION IF I CAN IS HOW ARE WE

02:05:24.516 --> 02:05:26.418
MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE DOING

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:28.087
ALL WE CAN FOR THE SOCIAL

02:05:28.153 --> 02:05:30.356
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. THAT

02:05:30.422 --> 02:05:31.023
WOULD GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE

02:05:31.090 --> 02:05:33.325
SPECIFICALLY. WE HEARD TODAY

02:05:33.392 --> 02:05:36.061
HOW UNEMPLOYMENT IS THE NUMBER

02:05:36.128 --> 02:05:38.864
ONE COST DRIVER WITHIN. WHAT WE

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:40.399
ARE SPENDING OUR RESOURCES ON.

02:05:40.466 --> 02:05:41.934
BUT THOSE SAME PEOPLE WHO ARE

02:05:42.001 --> 02:05:44.036
RECEIVING UNEMPLOYMENT HAVE WE-

02:05:44.103 --> 02:05:45.905
TALKED OR THOUGHT ABOUT THEIR

02:05:45.971 --> 02:05:47.673
HOUSING NEEDS THEIR FOOD

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:50.209
INSECURITY AND- OTHER SERVICES

02:05:50.276 --> 02:05:52.344
THAT THEY MAY HAVE NEEDS IN

02:05:52.411 --> 02:06:02.254
THIS TIME OF CRISIS. SO AT

02:06:02.321 --> 02:06:06.158
THINK WE ARE TRYING TO LOOK. WE

02:06:06.225 --> 02:06:07.693
ARE TRYING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT

02:06:07.760 --> 02:06:09.061
ALL OF THOSE THINGS WE'VE HAD

02:06:09.128 --> 02:06:10.896
WE'VE ON IS TO HAVE NUMBER OF

02:06:10.963 --> 02:06:12.798
PROGRAMS ACROSS SOCIAL SERVICES

02:06:12.865 --> 02:06:14.733
IF YOU LOOK AT HOUSING TO LOOK

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:16.468
AT DELIVERY OF FOOD FOR

02:06:16.535 --> 02:06:18.470
SPECIFIC POPULATIONS AND WE DO

02:06:18.537 --> 02:06:19.872
AGREE THAT YOU KNOW SOME OF THE

02:06:19.939 --> 02:06:21.674
HARDEST HIT POPULATIONS ARE HIT

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:24.576
ON MULTIPLE FRONTS FROM PAY-

02:06:24.643 --> 02:06:26.512
YEAH PAY DISPARITY TO YOU KNOW

02:06:26.578 --> 02:06:28.480
HOUSING TO FOOD PROGRAMS AND IF

02:06:28.547 --> 02:06:30.516
WE KNOW THAT. IF WE WANT FOLKS

02:06:30.582 --> 02:06:32.017
TO GET THROUGH THIS AND ALSO TO

02:06:32.084 --> 02:06:33.585
ISOLATE QUARANTINE AS NEEDED IF

02:06:33.652 --> 02:06:35.888
THEY ARE EXPOSED OR IN FACT AT

02:06:35.955 --> 02:06:36.989
THAT ALL OF THOSE THINGS NEED

02:06:37.056 --> 02:06:39.024
TO WORK TOGETHER ONE OF THE

02:06:39.091 --> 02:06:40.926
CATALYSTS- INDEED FOR THIS WAS

02:06:40.993 --> 02:06:42.861
A HEALTH EQUITY MEASURE TO MAKE

02:06:42.928 --> 02:06:44.863
SURE THAT AS WE- PROGRESS AND

02:06:44.930 --> 02:06:46.732
DO BETTER IN THE STATE THAT ALL

02:06:46.799 --> 02:06:48.534
CALIFORNIANS DO BETTER AND NOT

02:06:48.600 --> 02:06:49.735
HEALTHEQUITY MEASURE WAS

02:06:49.802 --> 02:06:53.138
INSTITUTED FOR THAT VERY REASON

02:06:53.205 --> 02:06:53.605
TO LOOK AT THAT SOCIAL

02:06:53.672 --> 02:06:55.074
DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. EARLIER

02:06:55.140 --> 02:06:56.909
ON OUR CHAIR HAD ASKED ABOUT

02:06:56.976 --> 02:06:58.577
WHAT GAPS EXIST AND I BELIEVE

02:06:58.644 --> 02:07:00.379
IT ASKED FINANCE ABOUT IT AND I

02:07:00.446 --> 02:07:02.748
WANTED TO GIVE BOTH THE PH AND-

02:07:02.815 --> 02:07:05.417
YEAH SO CHANCE TO. ANSWER WHAT.

02:07:05.484 --> 02:07:07.820
GAPS THEY'VE NOTICED IN OUR-

02:07:07.886 --> 02:07:09.421
DELIVERY OF CARE DURING THIS

02:07:09.488 --> 02:07:12.391
PANDEMIC AND- WHAT'S BEING DONE

02:07:12.458 --> 02:07:18.030
TO MEET THOSE GAPS. BETWEEN I

02:07:18.097 --> 02:07:19.765
THINK WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TRYING

02:07:19.832 --> 02:07:22.735
TO ADDRESS EVERY GAP AS WE- WE

02:07:22.801 --> 02:07:24.903
HAVE NOTICED THEM I THINK THAT.

02:07:24.970 --> 02:07:26.972
CLEARLY ONE OF THE GAPS THAT WE

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.741
CONTINUE TO GUARD AGAINST AS

02:07:28.807 --> 02:07:29.975
TRYING TO CONTROL DISEASE

02:07:30.042 --> 02:07:31.744
TRANSMISSION SO THAT OUR HEALTH

02:07:31.810 --> 02:07:35.047
CARE SYSTEM STAYS- ABLE TO DEAL

02:07:35.114 --> 02:07:36.415
WITH THE PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

02:07:36.482 --> 02:07:37.883
FACT THAT AND SO I THINK THAT.

02:07:37.950 --> 02:07:40.185
NATIONALLY YEAH THERE ARE NOT

02:07:40.252 --> 02:07:41.954
ENOUGH STAFF IN- AND HEALTH

02:07:42.021 --> 02:07:44.456
CARE AND SO HOW DO WE MAKE SURE

02:07:44.523 --> 02:07:46.091
THAT WE TITRATE SORT OF OPENING

02:07:46.158 --> 02:07:47.826
UP SECTORS LOOKING AT WHAT

02:07:47.893 --> 02:07:49.261
WE'RE DOING SO THAT WE CAN KEEP

02:07:49.328 --> 02:07:50.796
THE NUMBER OF FOLKS IN OUR

02:07:50.863 --> 02:07:52.664
HEALTH CARE INSTITUTIONS OR IN

02:07:52.731 --> 02:07:55.501
OUR HOSPITALS PARTICULARLY- YEP

02:07:55.567 --> 02:07:56.735
KEEP OUR HEALTH SYSTEM STRONG

02:07:56.802 --> 02:07:57.669
ENOUGH TO DEAL WITH THE

02:07:57.736 --> 02:07:59.738
EVERYBODY COMING IN. SO I GAP

02:07:59.805 --> 02:08:01.240
IF THIS GETS BIGGER IT WILL

02:08:01.306 --> 02:08:02.574
OBVIOUSLY BE HOW CLINICAL

02:08:02.641 --> 02:08:04.276
STAFFING AND SO WE'RE DOING

02:08:04.343 --> 02:08:05.844
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO ADDRESS

02:08:05.911 --> 02:08:09.214
THAT BUT IT WILL BE A NATIONAL

02:08:09.281 --> 02:08:10.649
PROBLEM. SO I LOVE THE WAY THAT

02:08:10.716 --> 02:08:13.252
YOU ANSWER THAT AND IF I COULD

02:08:13.318 --> 02:08:13.919
I WOULD SAY WE'VE NEED A

02:08:13.986 --> 02:08:16.121
FEDERAL PARTNER TO HELP TO LEAD

02:08:16.188 --> 02:08:17.990
DURING THIS CRISIS AND REALLY

02:08:18.057 --> 02:08:20.692
WOULD. LOOK TO THEM TO HELP US

02:08:20.759 --> 02:08:21.527
TO MEET ANY GAPS THAT MAY

02:08:21.593 --> 02:08:24.696
EXIST. NOW SINCE YOU MENTIONED

02:08:24.763 --> 02:08:27.099
PROVIDERS. YOU KNOW I'M A

02:08:27.166 --> 02:08:29.401
RECOVERING POSITION I ACTUALLY.

02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:31.236
PROVIDED CARE MYSELF BUT

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:32.571
HAVEN'T BEEN IN THE R. FOR A

02:08:32.638 --> 02:08:34.373
NUMBER OF REASONS. AND SO NOW I

02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.674
ACTUALLY LIKE TO THINK OF MY

02:08:35.741 --> 02:08:37.242
SISTER WHO STILL IS PRACTICING

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:39.945
AND HI SIR SHE'S A NURSE

02:08:40.012 --> 02:08:41.814
EDUCATOR THERE. AND I THINK A

02:08:41.880 --> 02:08:44.450
LOT ABOUT THE PANDEMIC FIFTEEN.

02:08:44.516 --> 02:08:46.485
THAT THIS TAKES WEEKS IT TAKES

02:08:46.552 --> 02:08:49.221
MONTHS IT IS NOT EASY ON THOSE

02:08:49.288 --> 02:08:51.657
WHO ARE. WORKING IN THE MIDST

02:08:51.723 --> 02:08:53.158
OF THIS EVERY DAY AND SO MY

02:08:53.225 --> 02:08:55.027

02:16:25.477 --> 02:16:26.778
OBVIOUSLY WHEN YOU HAVE A

02:16:26.845 --> 02:16:28.146
HUNDRED AND TWENTY LEGISLATORS

02:16:28.213 --> 02:16:30.181
THAT ARE TOUCH IT'S VERY

02:16:30.248 --> 02:16:32.551
DIFFICULT FOR EVERYBODY TO FEEL

02:16:32.617 --> 02:16:34.753
THAT SAME LEVEL OF OWNERSHIP

02:16:34.819 --> 02:16:36.021
AND OBVIOUSLY THE SCALE OF

02:16:36.087 --> 02:16:37.689
WHICH IS TO ME THAT YOU'VE

02:16:37.756 --> 02:16:39.491

02:16:39.558 --> 02:16:40.325
NEVER HAD TO DEAL WITH AND

02:16:40.392 --> 02:16:41.693
HOPEFULLY WE NEVER WILL HAVE TO

02:16:41.760 --> 02:16:42.561
YOU KNOW HAVE TO DEAL WITH

02:16:42.627 --> 02:16:45.263
THIS. SORT OF SCOPE AGAIN CAN

02:16:45.330 --> 02:16:50.335

PLAN MAKING TO. KIND OF ADAPT

02:16:54.639 --> 02:16:58.843
TO THE- SIZE OF A EMERGENCY.

02:16:58.910 --> 02:17:00.579
AND THANK YOU APPRECIATE THE

02:17:00.645 --> 02:17:02.581
QUESTION AND ABSOLUTELY OUR

02:17:02.647 --> 02:17:04.482
SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED IT'S BEEN

02:17:04.549 --> 02:17:06.918
AROUND IN CALIFORNIA FOR A LONG

02:17:06.985 --> 02:17:08.587
TIME KNOWING THAT WE HAVE. A

02:17:08.653 --> 02:17:11.489
MULTI HAZARD FOCUS AND- YOU

02:17:11.556 --> 02:17:12.691
KNOW AND IT WAS DESIGNED WITH

02:17:12.757 --> 02:17:14.259
IN MIND YOU KNOW THE ABILITY TO

02:17:14.326 --> 02:17:15.160
BE FLEXIBLE FOR WHATEVER WE

02:17:15.226 --> 02:17:16.928
FACE BUT YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY

02:17:16.995 --> 02:17:18.663
RIGHT IT'S REALLY UNPRECEDENTED

02:17:18.730 --> 02:17:20.265
ICERTAINLY IN MY EXPERIENCE TO

02:17:20.332 --> 02:17:21.499
HAVE SOMETHING THAT NOT ONLY

02:17:21.566 --> 02:17:22.968
REACHES WE'VE HAD DISASTERS

02:17:23.034 --> 02:17:23.602
THAT HAVE TOUCHED EVERY

02:17:23.668 --> 02:17:25.337
CALIFORNIA ALL AT ONCE WE'VE

02:17:25.403 --> 02:17:25.971
HAD FLOODS WE'VE HAD THOSE TYPE

02:17:26.037 --> 02:17:27.505
OF THINGS BUT THIS ONE- WITH

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:29.708
THAT SO MANY FACETS OF IT. AND

02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:31.042
THAT ARE AFFECTING EVERY PART

02:17:31.109 --> 02:17:33.311
OF SOCIETY REALLY IS UNUSUAL

02:17:33.378 --> 02:17:35.413
AND- A CHALLENGE TO MAKE SURE

02:17:35.480 --> 02:17:36.314
THEY WERE COHESIVE AND

02:17:36.381 --> 02:17:39.084
COORDINATED AND- AS RESPONSIVE

02:17:39.150 --> 02:17:40.752
OR AM IN COMMUNICATING OUR

02:17:40.819 --> 02:17:43.421
RESPONSIVENESS. AS AS THE SAME

02:17:43.488 --> 02:17:44.789
WAY THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO

02:17:44.856 --> 02:17:45.957
SUCCESSFULLY AS YOU MENTION AND

02:17:46.024 --> 02:17:46.925
WILD WILDFIRES AND EARTHQUAKES

02:17:46.992 --> 02:17:47.792
THINGS ARE LITTLE MORE

02:17:47.859 --> 02:17:50.695
GEOGRAPHICALLY CENTRIC- SO I

02:17:50.762 --> 02:17:51.396
CAN SAY THAT AND WE LEARNED A

02:17:51.463 --> 02:17:53.565
LOT- YOU KNOW A LOT OF THIS WAS

02:17:53.632 --> 02:17:55.233
UNPRECEDENTED WE DIDN'T KNOW WE

02:17:55.300 --> 02:17:56.735
DID THINGS DIDN'T GO PERFECTLY.

02:17:56.801 --> 02:17:58.303
AND HOPEFULLY WE'VE IMPROVED

02:17:58.370 --> 02:17:59.604
AND ADJUSTED I'VE SEEN THAT

02:17:59.671 --> 02:18:00.772
HAPPEN JUST WITH A DIFFERENT

02:18:00.839 --> 02:18:03.008
FORMS THAT WE'VE- HAD WE YOU

02:18:03.074 --> 02:18:04.275
KNOW WITH THE LEGISLATURE WITH

02:18:04.342 --> 02:18:06.044
THE COUNTIES WITH- ARE

02:18:06.111 --> 02:18:06.811
DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT

02:18:06.878 --> 02:18:08.913
STAKEHOLDERS THAT ARE INVOLVED-

02:18:08.980 --> 02:18:11.249
I THINK THAT- ANOTHER THING

02:18:11.316 --> 02:18:13.184
THAT IS- YOU KNOW KIND OF

02:18:13.251 --> 02:18:16.121
IMPORTANT TO SAY IS THAT WE

02:18:16.187 --> 02:18:18.623
ARE. ADJUSTING THEIR RESPONSE

02:18:18.690 --> 02:18:20.825
AND- BRINGING THAT STATE FAMILY

02:18:20.892 --> 02:18:23.061
TOGETHER TO ANTICIPATE AND THEN

02:18:23.128 --> 02:18:25.263
REACT TO IT IN IN YOU KNOW KIND

02:18:25.330 --> 02:18:26.564
OF A ONE TEAM ONE FIGHT THIS

02:18:26.631 --> 02:18:28.366
VERY COULD HAVE EASILY BEEN-

02:18:28.433 --> 02:18:29.300
DIFFERENT AGENCIES DOING

02:18:29.367 --> 02:18:30.669
DIFFERENT THINGS. ALL

02:18:30.735 --> 02:18:31.870
RESPONDING TO SOMETHING THAT'S

02:18:31.936 --> 02:18:33.705
HAPPENING IN OUR WORLD AND THAT

02:18:33.772 --> 02:18:35.674
REALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT-

02:18:35.740 --> 02:18:36.574
THERE COULD BE TREMENDOUS

02:18:36.641 --> 02:18:38.410
OVERLAP OR CONFLICT THAT CAN

02:18:38.476 --> 02:18:39.878
ARISE WITHOUT WE'RE ALLOCATING

02:18:39.944 --> 02:18:42.080
OUR RESOURCES. AND WE KNOW THAT

02:18:42.147 --> 02:18:43.181
WE KNOW THAT FROM EXPERIENCE

02:18:43.248 --> 02:18:44.749
WITH OTHER KINDS OF EVENTS OR

02:18:44.816 --> 02:18:46.951
FOR MANAGING MULTIPLE EVENTS

02:18:47.018 --> 02:18:49.187
ALL AT ONCE THAT THE BEST WAY

02:18:49.254 --> 02:18:51.956
TO DO THAT IS TO CENTRALIZE AND

02:18:52.023 --> 02:18:53.191
TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE UNIFIED

02:18:53.258 --> 02:18:54.092
IN OUR STATE SAID THAT WERE

02:18:54.159 --> 02:18:55.760
UNIFIED IN HOW RESPONDING TO

02:18:55.827 --> 02:18:59.564
YOU. AND TO YOUR CONSISTENT

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:02.100
CONSTITUENTS SO I DO IN ORDER

02:19:02.167 --> 02:19:03.868
TO. SO MUCH. AS IS SOMETHING

02:19:03.935 --> 02:19:05.970
THAT WE ARE UNDERSTANDING IS

02:19:06.037 --> 02:19:07.939
EVOLVING AND WE'RE WILLING TO

02:19:08.006 --> 02:19:10.442
AND HAVE ADJUSTED. AS THIS

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:13.845
PANDEMIC HAS EVOLVED AND- ARE

02:19:13.912 --> 02:19:14.846
LOOKING FORWARD TO A WHOLE

02:19:14.913 --> 02:19:17.215
NOTHER- COMPONENT OF IT TO THAT

02:19:17.282 --> 02:19:19.017
WILL BE A TREMENDOUS

02:19:19.084 --> 02:19:21.553
TREMENDOUS- ASSET IN GETTING

02:19:21.619 --> 02:19:23.655
PAST THIS PANDEMIC OR AT LEAST

02:19:23.722 --> 02:19:25.457
GETTING. IMPROVING THE- OUR

02:19:25.523 --> 02:19:26.524
ABILITY TO CONTEND WITH THAT

02:19:26.591 --> 02:19:28.026
WHICH IS THE VACCINE PLANNING.

02:19:28.093 --> 02:19:30.261
SO ALL OF THAT ADJUSTMENT

02:19:30.328 --> 02:19:33.131
HAPPENS IN REAL TIME- IT IS

02:19:33.198 --> 02:19:34.299
GOING TO REMAIN A CHALLENGE

02:19:34.365 --> 02:19:35.967

02:19:36.034 --> 02:19:38.103

COLLEAGUE MISTER COOPER- MADE

02:22:05.550 --> 02:22:06.684
THE POINT THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:22:06.751 --> 02:22:08.086
CAN WHAT ROLE WE PLAY IN THE

02:22:08.152 --> 02:22:14.192
WRONG VACCINE- I'M CURIOUS. IS

02:22:14.259 --> 02:22:17.195
THE VACCINE- SAFETY SIGN

CONSIDER VIEW WORKERS THAT OU

NEED TO CALIFORNIA IS THAT

02:22:20.265 --> 02:22:21.299
SOMETHING OTHER STATES ARE ALSO

02:22:21.366 --> 02:22:26.037
DOING. AND ESTABLISHING I GUESS

02:22:26.104 --> 02:22:26.804
KIND OF THE PROTOCOL REFER

02:22:26.871 --> 02:22:29.207
WORDY WITH WHICH TO THE ROLLOUT

02:22:29.274 --> 02:22:33.544
OR OR POTENTIALLY BLOCK ACCESS

02:22:33.611 --> 02:22:34.445
TO FDA APPROVED VACCINE. THAT'S

02:22:34.512 --> 02:22:35.680
LIKE A SPACE MAY LEGISLATION TO

02:22:35.747 --> 02:22:38.783
PLAY A ROLE OR MAYBE NOT-

02:22:38.850 --> 02:22:41.452
BUNKERS TO UNDERSTAND THAT

02:22:41.519 --> 02:22:54.832
BETTER. AWESOME A SCIENTIFIC

02:22:54.899 --> 02:22:58.636
SAFETY COMMITTEE I'M AND SO WE

02:22:58.703 --> 02:23:00.004
YEAH WE ARE WORKING WITH SOME

02:23:00.071 --> 02:23:01.706
OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON OUR

02:23:01.773 --> 02:23:03.308
COMMITTEE ARE ALSO WORKING AT

02:23:03.374 --> 02:23:05.143
THE NATIONAL LEVEL WE HAVE ACT

02:23:05.209 --> 02:23:07.312
THEY WILL HAVE ACCESS TO FTA

02:23:07.378 --> 02:23:09.914
INFORMATION REAL TIME WE EXPECT

02:23:09.981 --> 02:23:11.716
THAT YOU KNOW WE WOULD. LIKELY

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:13.584
COME TO THE SAME CONCLUSIONS AS

02:23:13.651 --> 02:23:15.086
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BUT WE

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:16.287
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE

02:23:16.354 --> 02:23:18.256
REVIEWED ALL OF THE DETAIL AND

02:23:18.323 --> 02:23:19.557
WE THINK THAT THAT'S THE BEST

02:23:19.624 --> 02:23:21.659
WAY TO BUILD TRUST- WE HAVE OUR

02:23:21.726 --> 02:23:23.528
OWN CALIFORNIANS IS TO MAKE

02:23:23.594 --> 02:23:24.462
SURE THAT WE HAVE LOOKED AT ALL

02:23:24.529 --> 02:23:27.966
OF THAT SAME. SCIENTIFIC

02:23:28.032 --> 02:23:28.533
INFORMATION AND WE HAVE ACTS

02:23:28.599 --> 02:23:30.635
LOOKING UP THAT. THE TUBE THAT

02:23:30.702 --> 02:23:32.437
TRUST AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH

02:23:32.503 --> 02:23:34.038
ACTIVATION CERTAINLY MAKES

02:23:34.105 --> 02:23:35.406
SENSE BUT IT JUST KIND OF

02:23:35.473 --> 02:23:36.774
BRINGS I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M

02:23:36.841 --> 02:23:38.676
ASKING IS YOU CAN UNDER WHAT

02:23:38.743 --> 02:23:40.345
AUTHORITY CAN WE DO THAT CAN

02:23:40.411 --> 02:23:43.348
STATES- BONTA DOES THAT INVOLVE

02:23:43.414 --> 02:23:44.983
THE LEGISLATURE IS NOT

02:23:45.049 --> 02:23:47.218
SOMETHING THE GOVERNOR CAN DO-

02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:50.822
UNILATERALLY- I'VE BEEN I WOULD

02:23:50.888 --> 02:23:52.223
HOPE THE EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID

02:23:52.290 --> 02:23:53.458
IS TRUE WHICH IS FARTHER SELVES

02:23:53.524 --> 02:23:54.359
WHERE WE'RE COORDINATING WITH

02:23:54.425 --> 02:23:55.760
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. ARE SOME WE

02:23:55.827 --> 02:23:57.628
HAVEN'T SEEN A LOT OF THESE

02:23:57.695 --> 02:23:58.429
PAST FEW YEARS BUT HOPEFULLY

02:23:58.496 --> 02:24:00.398
WE'RE GOING TO SEE- HERE GOING

02:24:00.465 --> 02:24:02.066
FORWARD BUT IN THE CASE THAT WE

02:24:02.133 --> 02:24:02.934
DON'T ARRIVE AT THE SAME

02:24:03.001 --> 02:24:06.537
CONCLUSION. WHERE DOES THAT

02:24:06.604 --> 02:24:09.374
LEAVE US. I THINK WE'RE

02:24:09.440 --> 02:24:10.908
EXPLORING THAT ARE ON AND WE DO

02:24:10.975 --> 02:24:12.143
HAVE A NUMBER OF LEGAL ISSUES

02:24:12.210 --> 02:24:13.911
THAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO. I WE

02:24:13.978 --> 02:24:15.380
HOPE THAT WON'T BE THE CASE BUT

02:24:15.446 --> 02:24:17.548
IF THAT WERE TO ARISE I THINK

02:24:17.615 --> 02:24:18.583
THAT IT WOULD BE MORE ABOUT THE

02:24:18.649 --> 02:24:20.551
EDUCATION OF WHAT VACCINE WE

02:24:20.618 --> 02:24:22.687
THINK. IS SAFEST AND WHY AND

02:24:22.754 --> 02:24:25.323
WHO IT'S SAFE FOR. ON BUT I

02:24:25.390 --> 02:24:26.324
THINK THE LEGAL ISSUES ARE

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:28.393
STILL ON. UNRESOLVED AND WE'RE

02:24:28.459 --> 02:24:29.627
CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT

02:24:29.694 --> 02:24:31.329
HAPPY TO SHARE THAT INFORMATION

02:24:31.396 --> 02:24:33.831
AS WE RESOLVE THOSE ISSUES.

02:24:33.898 --> 02:24:39.337
OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY MISTER

02:24:39.404 --> 02:24:42.573

ALL RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER

02:24:47.278 --> 02:24:49.547
CHAIRMAN AND- FIRST I JUST WANT

02:24:49.614 --> 02:24:51.716
TO AGREE WITH. THE REMARKS OF

02:24:51.783 --> 02:24:54.352
MY COLLEAGUES FROM MERCED- WITH

02:24:54.419 --> 02:24:58.089
REGARD TO THE EARLIER PANEL-

02:24:58.156 --> 02:24:59.757
WE'VE SEEN GRABBED A GREAT

02:24:59.824 --> 02:25:03.461
DISPARITY. BETWEEN THE MONIES

02:25:03.528 --> 02:25:04.629
THAT WERE MADE AVAILABLE TO

02:25:04.695 --> 02:25:07.331
MORE URBAN AREAS AND THOSE TO

02:25:07.398 --> 02:25:09.133
MORE RURAL AND I. I WANTED TO

02:25:09.200 --> 02:25:11.369
JUST ADD TO THAT WHAT WE ALSO

02:25:11.436 --> 02:25:14.005
SAW. WAS A DELAY IN THE MONEY

02:25:14.072 --> 02:25:15.440
GETTING SENT OUT TO THOSE RURAL

02:25:15.506 --> 02:25:17.975
COUNTIES AND THAT THAT MONEY

02:25:18.042 --> 02:25:20.211
WAS PARCELED OUT SLOWLY. AND IT

02:25:20.278 --> 02:25:22.780
WAS GIVEN BUT TO THE URBAN

02:25:22.847 --> 02:25:23.548
COUNTIES IT WAS GIVEN AS A

02:25:23.614 --> 02:25:25.950
COMPLETE- FUNDING EARLIER IN

02:25:26.017 --> 02:25:28.086
TIME. WHICH WAS EXTREMELY

02:25:28.152 --> 02:25:31.656
PROBLEMATIC- FOR RURAL COUNTIES

02:25:31.722 --> 02:25:32.857
WHO ARE ALREADY SUFFERING.

02:25:32.924 --> 02:25:34.892
THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC AND THE

02:25:34.959 --> 02:25:38.129
LOSS OF REVENUE. ALL THE SAME.

02:25:38.196 --> 02:25:40.798
NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT- THE

02:25:40.865 --> 02:25:42.800
URBAN PARTS OF THE STATE HAVE

02:25:42.867 --> 02:25:45.103
EXPERIENCED WE ALL EXPERIENCE

02:25:45.169 --> 02:25:49.774
THOSE THINGS- AND TO DELAY THE

02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:50.808
CARE IS ACT FUNNY NOW AS WAS

02:25:50.875 --> 02:25:53.444
DONE- WAS JUST COMPLETELY

02:25:53.511 --> 02:25:55.313
WRONG. NOT TO MENTION THE FACT

02:25:55.379 --> 02:25:56.481
THAT THERE IS SUCH A

02:25:56.547 --> 02:25:59.050
DISPROPORTIONATE DIFFERENCE. IN

02:25:59.117 --> 02:26:01.819
THE FUNDING. YOU'RE LISTENING

02:26:01.886 --> 02:26:03.054
TO THAT PANEL I THINK IT IS

02:26:03.121 --> 02:26:04.322
IT'S JUST BECOME VERY

02:26:04.388 --> 02:26:06.491
ABUNDANTLY CLEAR TO ME. THAT

02:26:06.557 --> 02:26:07.892
THERE IS NO PARTNERSHIP

02:26:07.959 --> 02:26:09.994
WHATSOEVER. BETWEEN THE

02:26:10.061 --> 02:26:11.729
GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE

02:26:11.796 --> 02:26:14.031
RIGHT NOW. I MEAN WE'VE JUST

02:26:14.098 --> 02:26:15.032
HOW MANY TIMES DO WE HAVE TO

02:26:15.099 --> 02:26:17.835
HEAR. FROM THE EXECUTIVES THAT

02:26:17.902 --> 02:26:19.971
FROM THE AGENCIES THAT THEY

02:26:20.037 --> 02:26:22.373
BASICALLY HAVE JUST GONE BEYOND

02:26:22.440 --> 02:26:24.175
THE AUTHORITY GRANTED TO THEM

02:26:24.242 --> 02:26:25.643
THAT THEY CONTINUE TO SPEND

02:26:25.710 --> 02:26:27.245
MONEY WITHOUT YOU KNOW GIVING

02:26:27.311 --> 02:26:28.679
THE PROPER NOTICE WITHOUT

02:26:28.746 --> 02:26:30.915
HAVING THE PROPER CONSULTATION.

02:26:30.982 --> 02:26:32.550
WITH THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE

02:26:32.617 --> 02:26:33.684
CONTINUE TO DO IT THEY JUST

02:26:33.751 --> 02:26:35.853
TELL US HERE TODAY. WE'RE SORRY

02:26:35.920 --> 02:26:37.455
ABOUT THAT I WILL TRY TO DO

02:26:37.522 --> 02:26:40.224
BETTER IN THE FUTURE- BUT THERE

02:26:40.291 --> 02:26:41.993
THERE REALLY IS NO PARTNERSHIP

02:26:42.059 --> 02:26:43.661
WHATSOEVER THEY KEEP SAYING

02:26:43.728 --> 02:26:46.364
THERE'S A PARTNERSHIP. BUT THE

02:26:46.430 --> 02:26:46.864
REALITY IS SOMETHING FAR

02:26:46.931 --> 02:26:50.301
DIFFERENT AND IT'S I THINK IT'S

02:26:50.368 --> 02:26:52.136
TIME FOR US IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:26:52.203 --> 02:26:53.938
TO UTILIZE OUR POWER THE POWER

02:26:54.005 --> 02:26:56.407
OF THE PURSE WE CAN PULL

02:26:56.474 --> 02:26:59.177
FUNDING BACK AWAY FROM THEM WE

02:26:59.243 --> 02:27:02.680
CAN- ALSO. SIR OUR OUR POWERS

02:27:02.747 --> 02:27:04.215
TO RESTRICT HIS AUTHORITY UNDER

02:27:04.282 --> 02:27:08.586
THE EMERGENCY. SERVICES ACT-

02:27:08.653 --> 02:27:11.923
NOBODY WANTS TO DO THAT. BUT

02:27:11.989 --> 02:27:13.291
WHAT WE'RE CONTINUE TO SEE IS A

02:27:13.357 --> 02:27:15.326
COMPLETE ABUSE OF THE AUTHORITY

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:16.794
AND THE MONEY IN THE FUNDING

02:27:16.861 --> 02:27:18.396
THAT HAS BEEN GRANTED AND

02:27:18.462 --> 02:27:20.298
WITHOUT THE PROPER CONSULTATION

02:27:20.364 --> 02:27:21.499
WITH THE LEGISLATURE I THINK

02:27:21.566 --> 02:27:26.871
IT'S TIME FOR US TO ACT. NOW

02:27:26.938 --> 02:27:29.740
GET INTO THE SECOND PANEL I

02:27:29.807 --> 02:27:31.909
JUST WANT TO EXPRESS. YOU ARE

02:27:31.976 --> 02:27:33.945
MY COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO I WILL

02:27:34.011 --> 02:27:36.280
AGREE WITH HIM THAT THE INITIAL

02:27:36.347 --> 02:27:39.050
RESPONSE HERE. SAVE LIVES THE

02:27:39.116 --> 02:27:40.851
FLATTENING OF THE CURVE.

02:27:40.918 --> 02:27:43.588
RESPONSE I THINK EVERYBODY

02:27:43.654 --> 02:27:46.824
AGREES WAS THE RIGHT DECISION.

02:27:46.891 --> 02:27:48.092
AND HELP TO ENSURE THAT OUR

02:27:48.159 --> 02:27:49.660
HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WAS PREPARED

02:27:49.727 --> 02:27:51.529
FOR THE CASE IS THAT- THAT WE

02:27:51.596 --> 02:27:53.264
ALTERNATELY SIDE NOT THEN BUT

02:27:53.331 --> 02:27:56.000
IN JULY. JUNE JULY WHEN WE SAW

02:27:56.067 --> 02:27:58.269
THE SPIKE IN CASES WE FLATTEN

02:27:58.336 --> 02:28:00.071
THE CURVE. ONLY TO SEE THOSE

02:28:00.137 --> 02:28:03.441
CASES COME IN JUNE AND JULY. IN

02:28:03.507 --> 02:28:04.642
OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM WAS

02:28:04.709 --> 02:28:06.143
BETTER ABLE TO HANDLE IT.

02:28:06.210 --> 02:28:07.979
NOBODY UNDERSTANDS THIS

02:28:08.045 --> 02:28:10.681
BLUEPRINT METRIC. AND I AND I

02:28:10.748 --> 02:28:12.316
AND I AND I JUST WANT TO JUST

02:28:12.383 --> 02:28:13.818
SHOW THIS SHOW THIS VERY

02:28:13.884 --> 02:28:15.753
CLEARLY FOR EVERYBODY. WHAT

02:28:15.820 --> 02:28:17.555
DOES IT MEAN WHEN THEY COUNTY

02:28:17.622 --> 02:28:19.523
GOES BACK TO PURPLE RIGHT NOW.

02:28:19.590 --> 02:28:20.491
WE'RE GOOD WE'RE STARTING TO

02:28:20.558 --> 02:28:21.859
SEE A RISING CASES WHICH

02:28:21.926 --> 02:28:23.461
EVERYONE HAD TALKED ABOUT AND

02:28:23.527 --> 02:28:26.897
ANTICIPATED WE'RE GOING TO SEE

02:28:26.964 --> 02:28:28.599
A RISE IN CASES IN THE FALL

02:28:28.666 --> 02:28:30.368
NOBODY I DON'T REMEMBER ANYBODY

02:28:30.434 --> 02:28:32.303
SAYING THAT WE WOULD NOT SEE

02:28:32.370 --> 02:28:33.304
RISING CASES THIS IS COMPLETELY

02:28:33.371 --> 02:28:36.107
ANTICIPATED. AND OUR HEALTH

02:28:36.173 --> 02:28:40.111
CARE SYSTEM IS READY TO PROVIDE

02:28:40.177 --> 02:28:41.579
FOR AND RESPOND TO THAT RISE.

02:28:41.646 --> 02:28:44.982
IN CASES. ONLY SEE THAT RISING

02:28:45.049 --> 02:28:48.152
CASES. MANY OF WHICH THE SOURCE

02:28:48.219 --> 02:28:49.787
OF THOSE CASES ARE PRIVATE

02:28:49.854 --> 02:28:53.958
GATHERINGS. THE RESULT OF GOING

02:28:54.025 --> 02:28:55.693
BACK TO PURPLE IS NOT TO GO

02:28:55.760 --> 02:28:57.595
FIND THE SOURCE OF THOSE CASES

02:28:57.662 --> 02:28:59.163
AND TO TRY TAKE MITIGATING

02:28:59.230 --> 02:29:01.432
EFFECTS TOWARDS THOSE ACTUAL

02:29:01.499 --> 02:29:03.534
CASES THAT WERE SEEN. NO THE

02:29:03.601 --> 02:29:05.636
ARBITRARY COMPLETELY ARBITRARY

02:29:05.703 --> 02:29:07.905
RESPONSES TO SHUT DOWN SMALL

02:29:07.972 --> 02:29:09.840
BUSINESS AGAIN. WHO'VE ALREADY

02:29:09.907 --> 02:29:11.075
BEEN WHO ARE ALREADY ON THE

02:29:11.142 --> 02:29:12.910
BRINK OF GOING OUT MANY OF THEM

02:29:12.977 --> 02:29:13.678
ALREADY HAVE GONE OUT OF

02:29:13.744 --> 02:29:15.946
BUSINESS. BECAUSE OF THE LAST-

02:29:16.013 --> 02:29:18.916
SHUT DOWN. AND TO SHUT DOWN

02:29:18.983 --> 02:29:21.852
CHURCHES. WHICH ALSO THERE'S

02:29:21.919 --> 02:29:24.488
BEEN NO SOURCES OF AN OUTBREAK

02:29:24.555 --> 02:29:26.590
DUE TO CHURCH SERVICES

02:29:26.657 --> 02:29:28.192
CERTAINLY HAVE NOT SEEN THAT IN

02:29:28.259 --> 02:29:33.364
MY REGION. AND SO THESE ARE THE

02:29:33.431 --> 02:29:35.299
THINGS THAT WEE SEEN. THIS

02:29:35.366 --> 02:29:36.967
ARBITRARILY SHUT DOWN THAT HAVE

02:29:37.034 --> 02:29:39.270
NOTHING TO DO MEANWHILE EVERY

02:29:39.337 --> 02:29:41.339
HOOK EVERY LOAN LOWE'S AND HOME

02:29:41.405 --> 02:29:44.141
DEPOT- IN OTHER BUSINESSES THAT

02:29:44.208 --> 02:29:46.410
ARE SOMEHOW DEEMED ESSENTIAL

02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:48.446
KEEP GOING ON YOU KNOW FULL

02:29:48.512 --> 02:29:50.681
BLAST PEOPLE IN THEIR EVERYDAY

02:29:50.748 --> 02:29:52.717
SOMETIMES ARE MASSIVE TIMES OR

02:29:52.783 --> 02:29:55.586
NOT- YEAH THERE THERE IS

02:29:55.653 --> 02:29:57.755
ABSOLUTELY NO CONNECTION AND

02:29:57.822 --> 02:30:00.925
NEXUS TO. THE CONSEQUENCES OF

02:30:00.991 --> 02:30:03.160
MOVING BACK TO A PURPLE TEAR

02:30:03.227 --> 02:30:04.395
AND WHAT WE'RE ACTUALLY SEEING

02:30:04.462 --> 02:30:08.165
ON THE GROUND. SO I KNOW I

02:30:08.232 --> 02:30:09.467
DON'T THINK THAT WHAT WE HAVE

02:30:09.533 --> 02:30:10.401
PUT IN PLACE RIGHT NOW THIS

02:30:10.468 --> 02:30:13.070
BLUEPRINT IT'S NOT SAVING LIVES

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.472
IT'S ACTUALLY MORE

02:30:14.538 --> 02:30:16.540
FUNDAMENTALLY HURTING LIVES.

02:30:16.607 --> 02:30:18.342
BECAUSE WE ARE SEEING RISES IN

02:30:18.409 --> 02:30:20.177
IN SUICIDE WE ARE SEEING RISE

02:30:20.244 --> 02:30:23.013
IN YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH A 60%

02:30:23.080 --> 02:30:24.982
INCREASE IN BUTTE COUNTY AND

02:30:25.049 --> 02:30:26.617
USE USE NEEDING MENTAL HEALTH

02:30:26.684 --> 02:30:30.921
SERVICES- WE ARE SEEING. PEOPLE

NOT GOING INTO GET CARE- THAT

02:30:33.457 --> 02:30:35.259
THEY NEEDED AND IN HOSPITALS

02:30:35.326 --> 02:30:38.162
AND HEALTHCARE FACILITIES- THE

02:30:38.229 --> 02:30:39.830
DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE

02:30:39.897 --> 02:30:41.665
OTHER SIDE OF THIS BLUEPRINT.

02:30:41.732 --> 02:30:45.569
METRIC FAR OUTWEIGH ANY

02:30:45.636 --> 02:30:46.771
BENEFITS THAT IS PROVIDING. AND

02:30:46.837 --> 02:30:47.838
I WOULD JUST LIKE TO HEAR I

02:30:47.905 --> 02:30:50.207
MEAN. ANYBODY IN PUBLIC HEALTH

02:30:50.274 --> 02:30:51.909
CAN TELL ME HOW IN THE WORLD.

02:30:51.976 --> 02:30:53.344
THAT IT MAKES SENSE THAT THAT

02:30:53.411 --> 02:30:55.079
THE THAT THE RESPONSE SHOULD BE

02:30:55.146 --> 02:30:56.647
TO SHUT DOWN SMALL BUSINESSES

02:30:56.714 --> 02:30:59.316
AND CHURCHES. AND THAT SOMEHOW

02:30:59.383 --> 02:31:01.152
THAT IS GOING TO MITIGATE.

02:31:01.218 --> 02:31:02.686
LEAVING EVERYTHING ELSE OPEN

02:31:02.753 --> 02:31:04.355
ESSENTIALLY LEAVING ALL OTHER

02:31:04.422 --> 02:31:07.258
THINGS OPEN- YES WE'RE TELLING

02:31:07.324 --> 02:31:09.260
PEOPLE NOT TO GATHER PRIVATELY

02:31:09.326 --> 02:31:12.029
BUT THEY'RE STILL DOING IT- YOU

02:31:12.096 --> 02:31:14.665
KNOW SO. THE ONLY PEOPLE THEY

02:31:14.732 --> 02:31:15.332
GET PUNISHED ON YOUR SYSTEM

02:31:15.399 --> 02:31:19.236

OWNERS THAT'S WHO ENDS UP

02:31:27.678 --> 02:31:29.413
GETTING AS A PRACTICAL MATTER

02:31:29.480 --> 02:31:32.082
SHUT DOWN INTO THE SYSTEM AND-

02:31:32.149 --> 02:31:35.286
AND FEEL THE FULL BRUNT OF THIS

02:31:35.352 --> 02:31:37.521
ARBITRARY RESPONSE MEANWHILE

02:31:37.588 --> 02:31:39.623
NOTHING ELSE HAPPENS CASES

02:31:39.690 --> 02:31:42.359

MANAGE THEM JUST LIKE WE DID

02:31:44.195 --> 02:31:46.330
LAST TIME. AND SOMEHOW THAT'S

02:31:46.397 --> 02:31:47.498
SUPPOSED TO BE A RESPONSIBLE

02:31:47.565 --> 02:31:49.467
WAY TO DEAL WITH THIS CRISIS

02:31:49.533 --> 02:31:51.969
I'M SORRY I DON'T SEE IT AND

02:31:52.036 --> 02:31:54.505
NONE OF MY CONSTITUENCY. SO I

02:31:54.572 --> 02:31:55.639
WOULD LIKE TO HEAR FROM PUBLIC

02:31:55.706 --> 02:31:57.708
HEALTH HOW IS IT I MEAN IT ALSO

02:31:57.775 --> 02:31:59.276
IS VERY BIASES OF EVENT

02:31:59.343 --> 02:32:00.678
COUNTLESS CONVERSATIONS WITH

02:32:00.744 --> 02:32:04.715
YOU. BIASED AGAINST RULE AREAS-

02:32:04.782 --> 02:32:05.716
I UNDERSTAND THERE'S GOING TO

02:32:05.783 --> 02:32:08.652
BE A NEW WORLD METRIC BUT IT

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:09.220
DOESN'T TAKE AWAY FROM THIS%

02:32:09.286 --> 02:32:10.855
ARBITRARY NATURE. OF THE

02:32:10.921 --> 02:32:14.458
RESPONSE- AND HOW IT NEGATIVELY

02:32:14.525 --> 02:32:16.827
IMPACTS ONLY CERTAIN PARTS OF

02:32:16.894 --> 02:32:18.362
SOCIETY AND ONLY CERTAIN

02:32:18.429 --> 02:32:20.998
INDUSTRIES. IT DOESN'T SEEM TO

02:32:21.065 --> 02:32:23.734
HAVE ANY REAL NEXUS TO.

02:32:23.801 --> 02:32:25.436
RESPONDING TO THE CASES THAT

02:32:25.503 --> 02:32:29.139
WERE SEEN ON THE GROUND. AND IS

02:32:29.206 --> 02:32:30.574
IT ANY WONDER WHY WERE SEEN

02:32:30.641 --> 02:32:33.544
PEOPLE JUST NOT FOLLOWING. I

02:32:33.611 --> 02:32:35.946
MEAN I WOULD LOVE ANY RESPONSE

02:32:36.013 --> 02:32:37.882
THAT MAKES ANY KINDOF SENSE-

02:32:37.948 --> 02:32:40.384
FROM PUBLIC HEALTH. AND AGAIN

02:32:40.451 --> 02:32:42.152
WE HAD NO WE AS THE LEGISLATIVE

02:32:42.219 --> 02:32:45.122
BODY OF HAD ABSOLUTELY NO INPUT

02:32:45.189 --> 02:32:47.758
INTO THIS. AB HAVE NO ABILITY

02:32:47.825 --> 02:32:49.026
TO ESTABLISH A EVEN THOUGH THAT

02:32:49.093 --> 02:32:50.961
WE ARE THE LAW MAKING BODY OF

02:32:51.028 --> 02:32:53.264
THE LAND BUT- ONE GROUP OF

02:32:53.330 --> 02:32:55.199
BUREAUCRATS IN PUBLIC HEALTH.

02:32:55.266 --> 02:32:56.800
IS TO DECIDE THIS ISSUE FOR

02:32:56.867 --> 02:32:59.069
EVERYBODY. THROUGHOUT SOCIETY

02:32:59.136 --> 02:33:00.271
YOU CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S

02:33:00.337 --> 02:33:02.006
A LOT OF FRUSTRATION SO PLEASE.

02:33:02.072 --> 02:33:03.874
EXPLAIN TO ME WHY YOUR METRIC

02:33:03.941 --> 02:33:05.776
MAKES ANY KIND OF SENSE. AND

02:33:05.843 --> 02:33:07.478
HOW ARE RESPONDING TO THIS

02:33:07.545 --> 02:33:16.353
CRISIS. SO I WILL START AND SAY

02:33:16.420 --> 02:33:18.722
THAT THE BLUEPRINT IS DESIGNED

02:33:18.789 --> 02:33:20.591
TO ENSURE A SLOW PROGRESSION

02:33:20.658 --> 02:33:22.993
FORWARD TO LIMIT THE MOBILITY

02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:24.395
ACROSS THE STATE WE ONLY HAVE

02:33:24.461 --> 02:33:26.463
SO MANY TOOLS IN OUR TOOLBOX OF

02:33:26.530 --> 02:33:28.933
WHAT WE CAN. DO TO SLOW THAT

02:33:28.999 --> 02:33:31.168
MOBILITY AND YOU'RE RIGHT WE

02:33:31.235 --> 02:33:32.136
WISH THAT EVERYBODY WOULD HE

02:33:32.202 --> 02:33:34.238
ADHERE TO THE M. HE EYES THAT

02:33:34.305 --> 02:33:35.372
WE PUT IN PLACE THE MASKING THE

02:33:35.439 --> 02:33:37.942
SOCIAL DISTANCING THE

02:33:38.008 --> 02:33:38.442
LIMITATION ON HOUSEHOLD

02:33:38.509 --> 02:33:39.777
GATHERINGS. BUT THERE ARE

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:41.145
INDEED YOU KNOW THOSE ARE

02:33:41.211 --> 02:33:43.013
CAUSING TRANSMISSION BUT

02:33:43.080 --> 02:33:44.682
TRANSMISSION IS BEING CALLED IN

02:33:44.748 --> 02:33:46.050
SOME OF THESE OTHER SETTINGS AS

02:33:46.116 --> 02:33:47.618
WELL AND AS WE DO FURTHER AND

02:33:47.685 --> 02:33:49.386
FURTHER RESEARCH AND COLLECT

02:33:49.453 --> 02:33:50.654
INFORMATION ON OUTBREAKS THERE

02:33:50.721 --> 02:33:52.289
ARE EXAMPLES OF OUTBREAKS IN

02:33:52.356 --> 02:33:53.824
SOME OF THESE OTHER SECTORS AS

02:33:53.891 --> 02:33:55.559
WELL. RETAILERS THAT YOU HVE

02:33:55.626 --> 02:33:56.860
BUT I AM SOME OF THE

02:33:56.927 --> 02:33:58.362
RESTAURANTS AND OTHER THINGS SO

02:33:58.429 --> 02:33:59.496
WE'VE TRIED TO DO A RISK

02:33:59.563 --> 02:34:01.432
ANALYSIS AND LOOK AT WHERE WE

02:34:01.498 --> 02:34:03.467
CAN OPEN MORE SAFELY AND AS YOU

02:34:03.534 --> 02:34:05.336
PROGRESS THROUGH THE TEARS. TO

02:34:05.402 --> 02:34:07.271
CONTINUE TO OPEN ON BUT AS YOU

02:34:07.338 --> 02:34:09.239
MOVE BACK WE THINK THAT YOU

02:34:09.306 --> 02:34:10.674
KNOW IT IS ESSENTIAL TO LIMIT

02:34:10.741 --> 02:34:11.809
THAT MOVEMENT SO THAT WE CAN

02:34:11.875 --> 02:34:13.077
KEEP TRANSMISSION DOWN AS MUCH

02:34:13.143 --> 02:34:15.746
AS POSSIBLE- WE HAVE PUT IN

02:34:15.813 --> 02:34:18.115
PLACE THE SMALL COUNTY METRIC.

02:34:18.182 --> 02:34:19.917
NOVEL BUT LOOKS AT ON ACTUAL

02:34:19.984 --> 02:34:21.885
CASES RATHER THAN CASE RATE TO

02:34:21.952 --> 02:34:23.821
ALLOW A LITTLE MORE FLEXIBILITY

02:34:23.887 --> 02:34:25.155
IN OUR RURAL COUNTIES WE HAVE

02:34:25.222 --> 02:34:27.558
LOOKED AT OBSERVATION PERIOD SO

02:34:27.625 --> 02:34:29.059
THAT WE COULD SEE IF DATA WAS

02:34:29.126 --> 02:34:30.594
TRENDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

02:34:30.661 --> 02:34:33.097
WE- WERE ON WE'VE WAITED A

02:34:33.163 --> 02:34:34.732
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME BEFORE

02:34:34.798 --> 02:34:35.633
MOVING BACK TO THE SMALL

02:34:35.699 --> 02:34:38.035
COUNTIES- AND GIVE THEM TIME TO

02:34:38.102 --> 02:34:39.970
SORT OF. ADJUST TO MINOR

02:34:40.037 --> 02:34:42.306
FLUCTUATIONS IN THEIR DATA SO

02:34:42.373 --> 02:34:44.141
WE ARE VERY MUCH COMMITTED TO A

02:34:44.208 --> 02:34:46.377
SLOW RE OPENING OF CALIFORNIA

02:34:46.443 --> 02:34:47.611
TO KEEP THE TRANSMISSION DOWN

02:34:47.678 --> 02:34:50.114
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE- YOU KNOW

02:34:50.180 --> 02:34:51.849
IT'S IT IS AT A ONE FOR ONE

02:34:51.915 --> 02:34:52.583
MATCH FOR EVERY SECTOR AND

02:34:52.650 --> 02:34:54.418
EVERY. TEAR AND EVERY BUSINESS

02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:56.420
NOW BUT WE'RE DOING OUR BEST TO

02:34:56.487 --> 02:34:58.255
UNDERSTAND THAT THE LIMITING OF

02:34:58.322 --> 02:35:03.627
MOBILITY ACROSS THE SECTORS.

02:35:03.694 --> 02:35:04.061
DOES HELP TO REDUCE

02:35:04.128 --> 02:35:07.431
TRANSMISSION. FOLLOW UP ADD TO

02:35:07.498 --> 02:35:10.768
THAT. EVEN IF I'M FOLLOWING

02:35:10.834 --> 02:35:12.069
YOUR REASONING AND YOU'RE

02:35:12.136 --> 02:35:14.038
TRYING TO LIMIT MOVEMENT WHY

02:35:14.104 --> 02:35:17.174
JUST RESTAURANTS YEAH WHY JUST-

02:35:17.241 --> 02:35:20.678
BARBER SHOPS NAIL SALONS- I

02:35:20.744 --> 02:35:22.880
MEAN CERTAINLY THERE'S MOVEMENT

02:35:22.946 --> 02:35:26.050
IN LARGE BIG BOX STORES I MEAN.

02:35:26.116 --> 02:35:27.351
THERE'S NOTHING IN YOUR METRIC

02:35:27.418 --> 02:35:29.787
THAT SHUTS THEM DOWN. I'M SURE

02:35:29.853 --> 02:35:30.721
THERE ARE PEOPLE YOU KNOW THERE

02:35:30.788 --> 02:35:31.955
ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE CONTINUING

02:35:32.022 --> 02:35:34.324
TO TRAVEL TO DIFFERENT PARTS OF

02:35:34.391 --> 02:35:36.160
THE STATE AND I'M HAND PLEASE

02:35:36.226 --> 02:35:37.327
I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU

02:35:37.394 --> 02:35:38.996
BECOME MORE RESTRICTIVE PLEASE

02:35:39.063 --> 02:35:41.031
DON'T READ THAT IN MY COMMENTS.

02:35:41.098 --> 02:35:43.567
AT ALL BUT IF THAT'S TRULY THE

02:35:43.634 --> 02:35:45.002
CASE HOW COME THERE'S NO

02:35:45.069 --> 02:35:47.471
RESTRICTION ON ON TRAVEL- TO

02:35:47.538 --> 02:35:49.139
DIFFERENT. TO DIFFERENT

02:35:49.206 --> 02:35:51.542
COUNTIES AND LOOKING AT OTHER-

02:35:51.608 --> 02:35:53.177
SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY THAT

02:35:53.243 --> 02:35:55.479
ALSO RELY ON MOVEMENT. AND

02:35:55.546 --> 02:35:57.414
PEOPLE GATHERING IN IN CERTAIN

02:35:57.481 --> 02:36:00.784
PLACES- I GET IT IT MAKES NO

02:36:00.851 --> 02:36:02.920
SENSE YOU'RE ONLY FOCUSING ON

02:36:02.986 --> 02:36:06.323
ONE PART OF THE COMMUNIST IT IS

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:06.924
THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HURT

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:08.192
THE MOST. THROUGHOUT SINCE

02:36:08.258 --> 02:36:09.760
MARCH THEY'RE THE PEOPLE THAT

02:36:09.827 --> 02:36:10.694
HAVE BEEN SHUT DOWN MULTIPLE

02:36:10.761 --> 02:36:13.263
TIMES. AND I ARE GOING TO GO

02:36:13.330 --> 02:36:14.932
SHUT THEM DOWN ONCE AGAIN. I

02:36:14.998 --> 02:36:16.567
MEAN I HATE TO KEEP USING IT

02:36:16.633 --> 02:36:18.569
BUT LOWE'S AND HOME DEPOT OR

02:36:18.635 --> 02:36:21.772
OPEN RECORD YEARS. RECORD YEARS

02:36:21.839 --> 02:36:23.640
AND THE SMALL BUSINESSES IN THE

02:36:23.707 --> 02:36:25.743
STATE ARE GETTING DESTROYED.

02:36:25.809 --> 02:36:27.811
AND I DON'T UNDERSTAND LIKE YOU

02:36:27.878 --> 02:36:29.880
KNOW HOW DID YOU MISTER

02:36:29.947 --> 02:36:31.915
GALLAGHER YEAH. WE DO HAVE TO

02:36:31.982 --> 02:36:33.383
HURRY UP SURGED IF YOU ASK A

02:36:33.450 --> 02:36:35.686
QUESTION PRECIADO IT AND THEN

02:36:35.753 --> 02:36:36.186
TRY TO GET OUT FROM THE

02:36:36.253 --> 02:36:38.589
SPINELLI. WELL I MEAN STOP THE

02:36:38.655 --> 02:36:40.090
SIMPLE QUESTION IS WHY DOES

02:36:40.157 --> 02:36:41.825
THIS APPLY TO. MANY OTHER

02:36:41.892 --> 02:36:43.227
SIMILAR TYPE OF INDUSTRIES

02:36:43.293 --> 02:36:44.828
ACROSS THE BOARD YOU'RE ONLY

02:36:44.895 --> 02:36:48.098
FOCUSING. ON RESTAURANTS NAIL

02:36:48.165 --> 02:36:50.067
SALONS SMALL BUSINESSES. THAT'S

02:36:50.134 --> 02:36:51.602
WHO HAS TO SHUT DOWN WE GO BACK

02:36:51.668 --> 02:36:54.238
TO PURPLE. AND YOU'RE TELLING

02:36:54.304 --> 02:36:54.772
PEOPLE CAN GATHER IN THEIR

02:36:54.838 --> 02:36:56.540
CHURCH. EVEN THOUGH NONE OF

02:36:56.607 --> 02:36:57.975
THOSE THINGS AND MAKE CONNECTED

02:36:58.041 --> 02:37:04.982
OUTBREAKS. FIRST OFF START BY

02:37:05.048 --> 02:37:06.083
SAYING SOME OF THOSE THE EIGHT

02:37:06.150 --> 02:37:07.651
WE ARE SEEING EVIDENCE OF

02:37:07.718 --> 02:37:08.852
OUTBREAKS AND SOME OF THOSE

02:37:08.919 --> 02:37:10.654
FACTORS THERE ARE ALSO A LOT OF

02:37:10.721 --> 02:37:12.222
OTHER SECTORS THAT CAN'T OPEN

02:37:12.289 --> 02:37:14.958
UNTIL WE GOT TO- EITHER THE

02:37:15.025 --> 02:37:16.627
ORANGE OR YELLOW TIER SO IT'S

02:37:16.693 --> 02:37:18.462
NOT JUST A FOCUS ON SOME OF

02:37:18.529 --> 02:37:20.898
THOSE BUSINESSES BUT- I'M WE

02:37:20.964 --> 02:37:21.598
AGREE THAT SOME OF THOSE

02:37:21.665 --> 02:37:23.801
BUSINESSES ARE. DO POSE SOME

02:37:23.867 --> 02:37:25.169
RISKS WHERE PEOPLE CAN'T BE A

02:37:25.235 --> 02:37:26.603
MATH CAN'T NECESSARILY BE

02:37:26.670 --> 02:37:29.306
DISPENSED- AND THEN WE HAVE TO

02:37:29.373 --> 02:37:30.974
MEASURE AND BALANCE THAT WITH

02:37:31.041 --> 02:37:32.609
SOME OF OUR CENTRAL SERVICES

02:37:32.676 --> 02:37:34.478
WHERE PEOPLE DO NEED TO GET

02:37:34.545 --> 02:37:36.013
FOOD AND DO NEED TO GET OTHER

02:37:36.079 --> 02:37:38.081
THINGS JUST TO DO THAT TO BE

02:37:38.148 --> 02:37:40.050
ABLE TO CONDUCT DAILY LIFE SO I

02:37:40.117 --> 02:37:41.518
THINK THAT. IT'S A BALANCING

02:37:41.585 --> 02:37:43.520
ACT THERE'S NO PERFECT ANSWER

02:37:43.587 --> 02:37:44.855
ON BUT WE'RE DOING THE BEST WE

02:37:44.922 --> 02:37:46.757
CAN TO TRY TO- SLOW THE

02:37:46.824 --> 02:37:48.125
MOVEMENT AND TO SLOW

02:37:48.192 --> 02:37:50.761
TRANSMISSION AND SO WE CONTINUE

02:37:50.828 --> 02:37:52.129
TO EVALUATE THAT WE HAVE

02:37:52.196 --> 02:37:53.997
ALLOWED AND MORE THINGS AS WE

02:37:54.064 --> 02:37:55.666
LOOK AT THE RISK ADJUSTMENTS

02:37:55.732 --> 02:37:57.467
AND LOOK AT. HOW ON BUSINESSES

02:37:57.534 --> 02:37:59.269
HAVE COME TO US AND EXPLAIN HOW

02:37:59.336 --> 02:38:00.838
THEY CAN OPEN MORE SAFELY WE

02:38:00.904 --> 02:38:02.039
HAVE MOVED SOME THINGS BACK

02:38:02.105 --> 02:38:04.107
INTO PURPLE HERE AND ALLOW THEM

02:38:04.174 --> 02:38:06.877
TO OPEN ON ME AND SO I THINK

02:38:06.944 --> 02:38:09.146
IT'S A CONTINUING DIALOGUE ON

02:38:09.213 --> 02:38:10.414
AND WITH THE BUSINESS SECTORS

02:38:10.480 --> 02:38:11.481
WE'VE TRIED TO WORK VERY

02:38:11.548 --> 02:38:12.449
CLOSELY ACROSS THE

02:38:12.516 --> 02:38:14.251
ADMINISTRATION. AND EACH OF THE

02:38:14.318 --> 02:38:16.420
BUSINESS SECTORS TO UNDERSTAND-

02:38:16.486 --> 02:38:17.955
WHAT THEY CAN PUT IN PLACE WHAT

02:38:18.021 --> 02:38:22.359
ON AND. CONTINUE TO MODIFY OUR

02:38:22.426 --> 02:38:24.795
GUIDANCE. THANK YOU WE HAVE A

02:38:24.862 --> 02:38:25.662
QUICK QUESTION FOR MISS

02:38:25.729 --> 02:38:26.897
AGUIAR-CURRY THE MEGA MOVES TO

02:38:26.964 --> 02:38:27.731
THE NEXT AND I'LL MAKE IT REAL

02:38:27.798 --> 02:38:29.933
QUICK AND THIS IS FOR- MISS

02:38:30.000 --> 02:38:32.736
FANELLI- ONE OF THE TOPIC THAT

02:38:32.803 --> 02:38:34.471
COMES UP. IN MANY OF OUR RURAL

02:38:34.538 --> 02:38:37.241
COMMUNITIES IS OUR- US SNIFFS

02:38:37.307 --> 02:38:40.244
IN THOSE- RESIDENTIAL HOMES

02:38:40.310 --> 02:38:42.012
THAT CONTINUE TO HAVE HIGHER

02:38:42.079 --> 02:38:44.047
RATES. THE THROW OFF OUR

02:38:44.114 --> 02:38:45.983
SMALLER COMMUNITIES NUMBERS AND

02:38:46.049 --> 02:38:47.851
THEREFORE CLOSING SOME OF OUR

02:38:47.918 --> 02:38:49.920
SMALL BUSINESSES- WHAT ARE WE

02:38:49.987 --> 02:38:51.855
DOING TO I MEAN. WE SEEM TO

02:38:51.922 --> 02:38:53.457
HAVE A HOT BED IN SOME OF OUR

02:38:53.523 --> 02:38:55.459
COMMUNITIES FOR THOSE. AND

02:38:55.525 --> 02:38:57.160
NUMBER ONE- WOULD BE GREAT TO

02:38:57.227 --> 02:38:59.229
HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY WITH-

02:38:59.296 --> 02:39:01.498
THOSE NUMBERS THAT DON'T AFFECT

02:39:01.565 --> 02:39:03.467
THE REST OF COMMUNITY. COLLEGE

02:39:03.533 --> 02:39:05.669
AND IF I AM SURE YOU'VE BEEN

02:39:05.736 --> 02:39:06.336
THIS IS FROM BROUGHT UP

02:39:06.403 --> 02:39:08.238
NUMEROUS TIMES BUT- YOU KNOW

02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:09.172

STATED EARLIER THAT WE HAD TO

03:01:04.987 --> 03:01:06.722
