THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TODAY- HEY YOUNG CATCHER WAS INVOLVED THE A WHOLE YET KING AT AND I'VE TAKEN A OCT TAKE THE AFTER A NOCTURNAL CLICK. OFF TODAY SO I'M DOCTOR CATCH WRESTLING BALDY I AM WHO BY AMERICAN CREDIT FROM NORTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ROLLED IN THE WHO THE VALLEY TRIBE- AND WHEN I INTRODUCED MYSELF I ALSO SAY I'M KENYON ON WHICH IS THE WHO BY WAY OF SAYING. I'M A PERSON I'M A HUMAN BEING- BUT ACTUALLY MEANS I'M A CORN EITHER. BECAUSE WE SAID THAT IF YOU WANTED TO BE A HUMAN BEING YOU HAD TO EAT ACORNS- I ACTUALLY. GET TO CHEAT A LITTLE BIT TODAY- THEY ASKED ME TO COME AND SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT CALIFORNIA HISTORY AND- SHOW UP FIRST A SHORT VIDEO THAT WE CREATED A BUT I'M WHAT STATE AS PART OF THE PLACE BASED LEARNING COMMUNITIES THAT WE WORK WITH. A COUPLE STATE WE'RE DOING SOME REALLY AMAZING THINGS WITH PLACE BASED LEARNING AND THERE ARE NUMBER FRESHMAN IN THE SCIENCES WHO COME IN AND THEIR FIRST YEAR AND NOW BECAUSE OF THE WORK WE'VE BEEN DOING WITH THE SCIENCE DEPARTMENTS. AND THE SCIENCE FRESHMAN NOW I'LL TAKE A NATIVE AMERICAN STUDIES WORSE. PART OF- LEARNING ABOUT THE SCIENCES ESPECIALLY WITH LIKE A LOT OUT. AND SO THE SPEECH. THAT TEXT FOR UNDERSTANDING OF ARMENIAN HISTORY WHEN THEY COME IN- THEIR FRESHMAN YEAR THEY HAVE MORE OF AN IDEA OF WHAT THEY'RE SORT OF WORRIED ABOUT AND- LEARNING OF. CALIFORNIANS TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT WAS THE DATE. CALIFORNIA HAS ALWAYS BEEN A POPULOUS PLACE IS HOME RIGHT NOW TO A HUNDRED AND NINE TWO HUNDRED ELEVEN TRIBES BUT BACK THEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT TRIBES EVERYWHERE. THERE IS NO EMPTY SPACE OF WILDERNESS THAT EXISTS IN THIS PLACE THAT WE CURRENTLY CALL CALIFORNIA. THE WAY YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE CALIFORNIA INDIANS EVERYWHERE. IS THAT EVERY PLACE HAD A NAME. THERE WAS NOT MOUNT TEN OR A FIELD OR REGION THAT THERE WASN'T A TRIBE WHO HAD ALREADY. FOR THE SCIENCES I THINK THAT THE LAND BRIDGE THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SORT OF A FIRST POINT OF. KNOWLEDGE ABOUT NATIVE PEOPLE. BUT THERE ARE MANY STUDIES THAT HAVE SHOWN THAT THERE WERE AS HUMANS IN THIS SIDE OF THE AMERICAS. OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND YEARS AGO. WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT. THAT IS AROUND THE SAME AMOUNT OF TIME IN WHICH THEY SAY PEOPLE WERE SORT OF FIRST LEAVING AFRICA. AND SO AND WE'RE ASKING PEOPLE TO COMPLICATE HOW THEY UNDERSTAND WHO WE ARE AS INDIGENOUS PEOPLES HERE WHAT WE SAY IS WERE FROM THIS PLACE. THAT'S A REALLY TRUE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE WE ARE A PART OF THE LAND AND THE LAND IS US AND WE- DIDN'T MIGRATE FROM SOME OTHER PLACE WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN THERE. WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN A PART OF OUR LAND. AND NOT ABOVE IT HELLO IT BUT- EQUAL TO AND WE HAVE A ROLL. BAR RULES COME FROM. THAT ENGAGEMENT COME FROM. SEEING WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE TO MAKE THINGS THE BEST WAY THEY CAN. ALL THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO UNDERSTAND BECAUSE I THINK SOMETIMES THEY THINK. CALIFORNIA PEOPLE ARE HERE BUT THEY'RE NOT REALLY DOING MUCH WITH THE SPACE THERE'S- SO MUCH EVIDENCE OF AGRICULTURE THERE'S EVIDENCE OF LARGE AREAS IN WHICH THEY'RE TENDING TO THERE'S EVIDENCE OF WAYS IN WHICH THEY'RE SHAPING WHAT WE NOW THINK OF. THE NATURAL LANDSCAPE. AND THEN CONVERSATION HAPPENS. DOLLARS THEY CALL IT INVASION. SO WE'RE BEING INVADED. WHEN CAN VERY- IS FIRST ON ONE OF HIS SHIPS AND FIFTEEN HUNDREDS BURNING OF THE LAND IS WHAT ACTUALLY GAVE AWAY PEOPLE ON THAT LAND THAT WAS LIKE THE FIRST THING THAT YOU KNOW COLONIZER SALAS OR TRADITIONAL. LANDS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THREE WEEKS OF DESTRUCTION FROM THE START OF THESE WAVES. THERE'S NOT REALLY A TIME PERIOD IN WHICH CALIFORNIA INDIANS CAN RECOVER FROM WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THEM. THE FIRST WAVE OF DESTRUCTION IS THE SPANISH MISSION SYSTEM. THE BILL THE FIRST MISSION AND SAN DIEGO. THERE'S TWENTY ONE MISSIONS THAT THEY BUILD IN TOTAL DISS FATHER IN A PRESS ERA AND THEY'RE BRINGING PEOPLE INTO THE MISSIONS IN THE HOPES THAT THEY CAN CREATE THIS LABOR FORCE TO BE ABLE TO ESTABLISH THIS. EXTENSION OF SPAIN. MISSION SYSTEM IS EFFECTIVELY ENSLAVEMENT SYSTEM OF CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE. THAT MISSIONARIES BRING ALONG WITH THEM SPANISH SOLDIERS THE SOLDIERS. ARE WRITTEN ABOUT IN THESE RECORDS AS- BEING PERPETRATORS OF SEXUAL VIOLENCE. NOT ONLY AGAINST WOMEN BUT ALSO CHILDREN. UNIVERSE ARE ACTUALLY TALKED ABOUT THAT IN HIS JOURNAL LIKE THEY'RE SEXUALLY ASSAULTING WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN FRONT OF PEOPLE. AND WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO STOP THEM THEY GET SHOT I MEAN IT'S A VERY VIOLENT TYPE OF SITUATION. THE MISSION I'M SORT OF STOPS AROUND SAN FRANCISCO SO UP HERE IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WHAT THEY SAY ABOUT US IS WE WERE CONTACTED RELATIVELY LATE. IN THAT SORT OF COLONIZATION CYCLE. WAIT I CONTACT WITH THEM EXPLORE SO WOULD COME THROUGH PEOPLE THAT WERE LOOKING MOSTLY FOR GOLD AND AT A POINT THEY FIND GOLD AND THIS IS WHERE YOU GET THE SORT OF LIKE MASSIVE INFLUX OF THE GOLD RUSH. AND IT JUST CAME LIKE OVERNIGHT AND IT CAME IN HARD. AND LIFE JUST CHANGED DRASTICALLY IN JUST IMMEDIATELY AND A LOT OF WAYS FOR CALIFORNIA PEOPLE. THEY'RE NOT HERE SO THAT THEY CAN SET UP A COLONY OR SO THAT THEY CAN ESTABLISH A LABOR FORCE THEY WANT GOALS THEY WILL KILL WHOEVER IS IN THE WAY THEY WILL TAKE A PART WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE TAKEN APART. THEY'LL DO WHATEVER IT TAKES. THE THING ABOUT THE GOLD RUSH THAT P. O. THINK ABOUT IS THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY AN ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION AS WELL. AND ON TOP OF THAT THEY ARE SETTING UP A POLITICAL SYSTEM AND THE STATE SSTEM OF LAWS AND GOVERNANCE THAT WILL LEGALIZE THE GENOCIDE THAT THEY WANT TO COMMIT AGAINST CALIFORNIA EIGHTEEN PEOPLE. OUR FIRST LOOK PETER BURNETT. ALL THIS HUGE POPULATION OF INDIANS AND STATE AND SO HE'S THE ONE THAT YOU KNOW CHARGE THE WAR OF EXTERMINATION CALIFORNIANS. THEN WE LOST YOU KNOW PROBABLY AROUND 80% OF OUR TOTAL POPULATION IT IS JUST A SHORT PERIOD OF YEARS. THERE IS SAYS ONE OF THE RESOURCES YOU WANTED WHAT WOULD MAKE HIM RICH FASTER. IS TO ASKING THE TRIBE TO HELP MORE SYSTEM THE CIVIL SINCE TRY PRIME WILL JUST GET TO THIS REGIS AND WEBER I'M OUT WE'RE GONNA MASSACRE WE'RE GOING TO HEAR THE FOR OURSELVES. EACH REGION OF CALIFORNIA IS ALLOWED TO SET THEIR OWN SORT OF WHAT ARE WE GONNAPAY FOR SCALP OR HEAD. BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADVERTISEMENT. WHAT YOU SEE IS THAT THEIR ADVERTISING THEM AND THINGS LIKE FIVE DOLLARS A HEAD AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS PER SCALP. THE FIRST YEAR THAT THEY DO THIS. THEY PAY ONE MILLION DOLLARS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYS THAT IT HAS PAID ONE MILLION DOLLARS FOR KILLING ANY PEOPLE THE SECOND YEAR THEY DO IT IT'S ONE MILLION DOLLARS. IN THIS REGION EVERY SINGLE TRIBE IN THIS REGION WOULD HAVE SOME KIND OF STORIES ABOUT THE VIOLENCE THAT CAME OUT OF THE GOLD RUSH. MY GREAT GRANDFATHER HINO HIS HIS FAMILY IS FROM CREDIT COUNTRY. HIS GREAT UNCLE HAD. HIS MOM HAD LIVED TO THE GOLD RUSH AND HE WAS BORN SORT OF LIKE AT THE TAIL END OF THIS PERIOD OF TIME. AND HE WOULD ALWAYS SAY TO MY MOTHER. IN REMEMBER GRANDDAUGHTER- YOUR HERE BECAUSE SOME MINOR WAS A BAD SHOT. LIKE THAT'S HOW CLOSE IT IS TO WHO WE ARE. WHEN WATER CONTENT GET ABOUT ALL IN RELATION TO FORGET ABOUT ALL THE SCIENCES AND WE HAD TO FORGET ABOUT ALL THE FALL LOSS OF THESE WE HAD TO BRING IT ABOUT EVERYTHING. THOSE INGRAINED PROS FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. TWO SHATTERED EXISTENCE THIS IS TAKING HIS FROM YOUR FAMILY AND TAKE ON BOARDING SCHOOLS. AND THIS IN THE YOU WERE NOT A PRACTITIONER CULTURES YOU'RE NOT TO. FRAZIER TRADITIONS YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO PRACTICE YOU KNOW I HATE TO SAY THIS WITH THE WHITE MAN'S RELIGION YEAR YOU WERE GOING TO CHRISTIANIZE YOU YOU'RE GOING TO FOLLOW OUR GUIDE. I KNOW NUMBER PRODUCT OF FOR SIMULATION. I KNOW I WAS STRIPPED OF. SOME OF THEM SMARTEST INFORMATION A HUMAN BEING COULD HAVE. I KNOW I DON'T HAVE THAT NOW. I KNOW IT'S ATTAINABLE OVER TIME. AND WE'RE ON THE RIGHT PATH. THERE'S ALL THESE GREAT MOMENTS OF NATIVE PEOPLE MAKING SURE THAT THEY WERE TRYING TO HOLD ON TO THINGS LIKE FIGHTING BACK AND MAKING PLANS FOR THE FUTURE. IT'S PALPABLE IN HUMBLE COUNTY. AMERICAN ESPECIALLY WE HAVE SOME ISRAELI TRIES WERE PUT THROUGH A LOT IT WASN'T JUST THE WE ASKED IT WAS HERE- BUT YEAH. WE'RE ALL PUT THROUGH A LOT DURING THE EARLY YEARS. HERE WE ARE GROWING. ROOM STRONGER NATIONS ARE WORKING TOGETHER AND WITH EACH OTHER. TO CREATE A POSITIVE THING. AND NOT ONLY LESS WORKING WITH EACH OTHER SISTER TRIES WE'RE WORKING WITH CITIES THE GOVERNMENT SAYS AROUND US THE SCHOOLS AGES YOU. TO MAKE THIS MORE POSITIVE. HUMBLE STATE UNIVERSITY IS WITHIN THE ABORIGINAL TERRITORY OF THE WE ARE PEOPLE AND THEN WE HAVE SEVERAL OTHER LARGE TRIBES AROUND HERE THE THREE LARGEST IN CALIFORNIA THE COUNTRY THE IRAQ IN THE LOOP ON. SO BEING THAT WE ARE IN THE BACKYARD OF THREE OF THE LARGEST TRIBES WE CAN DRAW AND PARTNER WITH SOME OF OUR LOCAL TRIBES. TO BRING THAT EXTRA EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT TO OUR STEM AND NATURAL RESOURCE. HERE THE INDIAN NATURAL RESOURCE SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING PROGRAM AND DIVERSITY INSTEAD WE GO BY INTERCEPT PLUS. OUR SERVICES GENERALLY PROVIDE NAVIGATIONAL SUGGESTIONS TO STUDENTS ASSISTING THEM NAVIGATE THE COLLEGE OF NATURAL RESOURCES AND SCIENCES. WE OFTEN OR IN REACHING THAT EXPERIENCEWITH EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES COMING FROM- INDIGENOUS PERSPECTIVE SO BRING IT UP OUR ANCESTORS PRACTICES AND TECHNIQUES OF MANAGING LANDSCAPES MELDING THEM MORE BREEDING THEM IN WITH THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD IN INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES. IN NATIVE STUDIES FOR DOING A SORT OF BROAD SPECTRUM OF WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LEARN FROM INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND CULTURES AND KNOWLEDGE IS SO THAT WE CAN BUILD A BETTER WORLD BUILD A BETTER WAY OF KNOWING. IT'S ABOUT HOW WE LEARN WITH AND FROM NATIVE PEOPLE INSTEAD OF. DISCIPLINES HISTORICALLY THAT ARE FOCUSED ON THE STUDY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE. MY PATERNAL GRANDMOTHER WAS ONE OF THE FOUNDERS AND THE INDIAN TRIBAL EDUCATION PERSONAL PROGRAM HI TECH- BACK IN THE LATE SIXTIES AND EARLY SEVENTIES. HER INTERVENTION OTHER MOTHERS AND GRANDMOTHERS THE WERE THE ONES THAT KIND OF STARTED A LOT OF OUR OTHER-COMMUNITY PROGRAMS ARE HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS ARE EDUCATION PROGRAMS I ALWAYS THINK IT'S A PRETTY AMAZING STORY ONE OF THOSE WOMEN ARE INCLUDED. I'M HAD ATTENDED BOARDING SCHOOLS AND FOR THOSE WOMEN TO COME BACK FROM THAT AND STILL UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEEDED HEALTH AND WE NEEDED EDUCATION AND WE NEEDED A STRONG COMMUNITY. WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE INDIAN TRAVEL EDUCATIONAL PERSONAL PROGRAM IN NINETEEN SERVICES WOMEN WITH MOXIE THEY COME FROM A GENERATION OF WOMEN WHO HAVE BEEN HAPPY TO JUST HOLD THAT STRING FOR SUCH A LONG TIME. IN PART OF THE WORKERS TRIBAL PEOPLES HAD WE BACK IN TAP INTO THAT BECAUSE IT'S ALWAYS THERE WE COME FROM A LONG LINE OF THOSE FOLKS WHO WERE MOVING FORWARD AND I'VE HAD TO. KEEP THEIR DIGNITY KEEP THEIR PRIDE. AND ALTHOUGH IT HURTS. WE'RE STILL DOING NOW. THAT HAPPENED FOR THE YOUNG PEOPLE TRAVEL PEOPLE IN PARTICULAR BUT ALSO FOR NON AND- TO HEAR THAT TO. THIS NOT ALL HISTORICAL TRAUMA NUMBER GOVERNMENT. KNOW WHAT'S IN STORE FOR TRAUMA WE'RE STILL HERE AND WE'RE NOT GOING ANYWHERE. WE'RE STILL LEARNING WE'RE STILL WONDERING THING I LIKE I LIKE TO GIVE BEHIND THE SCENES INFORMATION ABOUT THE MAKING OF THE VIDEO AND THERE'S A SCENE IN THERE ME TEACHING MY STUDENTS AND I LOVE THAT FOOTAGE BECAUSE- THEY NEVER WRITE NOTES. ARE LIKE REALLY LOOK LIKE THEY'RE SUPER INTO WHAT I'M SAYING IN IN THAT THAT VIDEO WHENEER I'M SAYING ANYTHING YOU SEE THEM ALL GO LIKE. REALLY FAST BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING FILMED. SO THE WHOLE. THE WHOLE TIME THEY WERE BEING FILMED. EVERY TIME I'D SAY SOMETHING THEY GO ALL IN THAT ALL RIGHT AND THEY LOOK REALLY REALLY INTO IT SO I WAS LIKE ANY VIEWS THAT IN MY FILE. I THINK ONE REASON WHY I MADE THIS VIDEO IS BECAUSE WE WANTED TO GIVE PEOPLE A WAY TO BE INTRODUCED TO CALIFORNIA AND IN HISTORY- BUT WE ALSO WANTED TO REMIND THEM THAT- THE CALIFORNIAN IN HISTORY THAT WE TELL IS NOT JUST ABOUT. GENOCIDE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT SORT OF THE DEATH AND DESTRUCTION IT'S KIND OF ABOUT THEWAYS IN WHICH WE ARE. THRIVING TODAY AND THE IMPORTANCE OF WHO WE ARE AS CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE TODAY. AND WHEN WE SHOWED THE VIDEO IN PUBLIC SPACES WHAT WE LIKE TO DO IS TO GUIDE PEOPLE PASSED. THE MOMENT. THE FIRST BEING INTRODUCED TO THE HORROR EPICNESS OF WHAT HAPPENED IN THE STATE OF. AN IN SOME OF. THE MORE HORRIFIC ACTS OF VIOLENCE THAT HAPPENED AGAINST CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE TO FOUND WHAT BECAME THE STATE. AND THEY WILL SERVE NOT MOVE PAST THAT PART. AND STAY. AND STAY THERE AND THEN NOT BE ABLE TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS THAT WE'RE ACTUALLY STILL HERE STILL DOING MANY THINGS IS STILL VERY INVOLVED- IN OUR LAND MANAGEMENT PRACTICES. AND IN BUILDING THE FUTURE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND SO IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US WHEN WE SHOW THE VIDEO TO ALWAYS POINT THAT. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE THINK ABOUT HOW THE VIDEO ENDED WITH THE MESSAGE OF. WHO WE ARE TODAY AND NOT SORT OF JUST ENDED IN THIS DISCUSSION OF CALIFORNIA HISTORY IS REALLY TRAGIC MOMENT. OF AN ATTEMPTED GENOCIDE OF AN ENTIRE PEOPLE. I'M I WANT. MY TO THE PO TODAY WITH. THE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO FISH KILL IN THE TRINITY IN KLAMATH RIVERS. THE REASON WHY IS THAT I REMEMBER VERY CLEARLY IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO STANDING UP THE HILL AND LOOKING OUT OVER THE TRINITY IN KLAMATH RIVERS. I WITH MY GRANDFATHER. MY GRANDFATHER'S NAME WAS MILTON WEALTHY. HE WAS A FORESTER I'M IN A TREE FALLER AND PROBABLY THE TOUGHEST GUY THAT I KNEW. IN MY LIFE HE'S A TELL ME A STORY ABOUT HOW ONE TIME A TREE STARTED FALLING WHILE HE WAS STILL ON THE TOP F IT. AND HE RAN DOWN THE ENTIRE TREE SO THAT NOTHING WOULD HAPPEN TO HIM AND THEN JUMPED OFF OF IT. AND JUST BROKE HIS WRIST. HE WAS SUPERMAN. ME AND IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER ORDER. NUMBER TRIPS TO THE LOW WATER FLOWS THAT HAPPENED. WITH THE DAM WE EXPERIENCE THE FISH CAN. OBSERVE HOUSES OF FISH. ARE THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEAD FISH SITTING ON THE SHORES OF OUR RIVER. AND WE WALKING OUT AND BROWN. HAD WHAT. YOU ARE. MY GRANDFATHER WHO HAD NEVER MY LOVE SCENE CRIED HIS VOICE CRACKED HE SHED TEARS AND HE SAID WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR FUTURE WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR OUR WORLD. IT BECOMES IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE HISTORY OF GENOCIDE IN THE STATE IS WHAT BUILT THE POLICIES THAT CONTINUE THINGS LIKE THE SEIZURE OF OUR WATER THE BUILDING OF DAMS THE WAYS IN WHICH WE POURED AND THEY POURED MERCURY INTO THE WATER THAT WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH WE ARE STILL DEALING WITH. PERCUSSIONS OF WHAT HAPPENED DURING THE SYSTEM AND THE GOLD RUSH AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD WHEN I TEACH CALIFORNIA HISTORY. AND I'M INVITED TO SORT OF TRAIN A LOT OF PEOPLE ON HISTORY. I TRY TO HELP THEM UNDERSTAND AND SHOW THAT HISTORY IS STILL INFORMING WHAT'S HAPPENING TODAY. AND TO ENCOURAGE THEM TO KEEP GOING ON AND NOT TO THINK THIS IS THE ONLY INFORMATION THAT THEY NEED TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING IN OUR COMMUNITY. PEOPLE HAVE WRITTEN MANY. THIS I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO READ. BUT THE TWO THAT I ALWAYS ELL PEOPLE TO START WITH OUR GENOCIDE IN NORTH WEST CALIFORNIA. BY JACK NORTON AND BAD INDIANS BY DEBORAH MARANDA. I THINK I'S IMPORTANT TO POINT OUT THAT THE MISSION MYTHOLOGY THAT'S FOR REDDING CALIFORNIA THROUGH OUR MISSION PROJECT AND I MISSION CURRICULUM TEACHES PEOPLE THAT THE MISSION SYSTEM WAS BE NINE. BUT IT IS NOT THE CASE IN FACT SEXUAL ASSAULT OF A WOMAN WITH ONE OF THE FIRST ACTS RECORDED BY MISSIONARIES AS A RESULT OF THE SYSTEM. THIS YEAR ALSO MARKS THE FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY OF JACK NORTON GENOCIDE IN NORTH WEST CALIFORNIA NORTON IS A WHO BUT CHEROKEE SCHOLAR AND WHAT HE VIEWED WITH THAT WHAT HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE GENOCIDE HE USE SETTLER ARCHIVES TO PROVE THAT. HE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE MOST HORRIFIC THINGS THAT HAPPENED TO OUR PEOPLE TO MY PEOPLE AND FAMILY THINGS LIKE MASSACRES THE INDISCRIMINATE KILLING OF WOMEN AND CHILDREN AND THE CREATION OF LAWS THAT ALLOW THEM TO A SLAVE. CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE IN THE CALIFORNIA ENTERED THE STATE THE MAN KNOWS THE STATE. LOOK AT THE WAY RECORDS HUMBOLDT COUNTY WHAT YOU DOUBT. THAT MOST PEOPLE IN SLAVE UNDER THESE LAWS AND CAL. WERE ACTUALLY CHILDREN. AGES SEVEN TO TWELVE AND MOST OF THOSE WERE YOUNG GIRLS. SO REALLY THEY HAD CREATED A SYSTEM OF SEX SLAVERY IN WHICH THEY WERE TRADING AT YOUNG WOMEN AMONGST EACH OTHER. THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE TODAY WE STILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE REPLICATIONS OF THIS IF YOU LOOK AT THE FACT. THAT WE ARE THE MOST LIKELY GROUP OF PEOPLE TO BE RATE IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA WE ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO GO MISSING. AND MURDERED WE ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO BE TRAPPED IN THE THAT'S THAT'S THAT DON'T ESCAPE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS IS THE LASTING THIS IS THE LAST THING. HAPPENED THREE GENOCIDE. I WE ARE FORCED TO PROTECT OUR YOUNG GIRLS TO. THEM WAY ONCE AGAIN TO PROTECT THEM. NOT JUST THROUGH LEGISLATION BUT THROUGH THE WAY THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND US AND KNOW THAT WE ARE PEOPLE. WE CONTINUE TO ALSO HAVE TO FIGHTFOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND OUR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. THE GOLD RUSH WAS DESTRUCTIVE TO THE ENVIRONMENT LANDS RECEIVED AS A RESULT OF THE GOLD RUSH AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. THAT STILL TRACE THEIR RIGHTS TO LAND AND OWNERSHIP OF LAND AND WATER BACK TO THE GOLD RUSH. LOOK AT THE WAY. THEY WERE. I'M LEAD. TIME IT WAS AS A DIRECT RESULT OF KILLING AND MASSACRES OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE. AFTER MASSACRE SETTLERS WOULD ENTER THE REGION THEY WOULD MAKE UP DOCUMENTS AND THEY WOULD SAY THAT THEY NOW OWNED THAT LAND AND ONLY TO THOSE RESOURCES. TRACING BACK ANY TYPE OF OWNERSHIP TO THE CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH ERASES THE VIOLENCE THAT IT TOOK TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. IF WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT TWO THREE HEALING IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN'T SPEND THE NEXT FEW YEARS JUST TESTIFYING TO OUR HISTORIES. FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT WE NEED TO BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP CONCRETE ACTIONS AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT WHILE WE HAVE THE EAR OF OUR NEW GOVERNOR WE HAVE TO REMIND HIM THAT OUR WORK IS ON GOING. THAT WE HAVE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME AND THAT WE SHOULD BE INTO BECAUSE WE ARE STILL HERE. AS LEADERS YOU HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEARN MORE ALSO BE ACCOUNTABLE TO INDIAN PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND NOT ONLY WHAT ABOUT OUR HISTORY BUT OUR ONGOING ISSUES WITH WATER. SAM AND REMOVAL OUR YOUTH ARE WOMEN AND FUTURES NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE THE HIGHEST RATE OF SUICIDE IN THE COUNTRY. WE ARE LESS THAN ARE THE MOST LIKELY TO COMMIT. I HAD A- GROUP. THE NATURE. WOMEN ARE ONES WHO ARE FORCED TO DO. WITH THE POLICIES THAT ARE PASSED THAT DON'T PROTECT US. THERE ARE PARTS OF THE YEAR WHEN OUR WATER IS TOXIC TO US BECAUSE OF THE SEIZURE OF WATER TO BUILD RESERVOIRS FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND AGRICULTURE. WE LIVE THIS EVERY DAY. I WAS INVITED TO HELP YOU ALL OVER VIEW CALIFORNIAN IN HISTORY. BUT I ASK YOU TO PLEASE BE MINDFUL THAT THROUGHOUT MY LIFE I HAVE ALWAYS BEEN REMINDED THAT WE ARE STILL HERE. AND WE MUST. BUILD OUR FUTURES WITH OUR PAST. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT PRESENTATION. JUDY QUESTIONS- COMMENTS OR ANYTHING FROM ASSEMBLY MEMBERS SEVERAL WOMEN CARILLO. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THAT A WONDERFUL PRESENTATION AND VIDEO- A PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED BEFORE AND I LOVE YOUR THOUGHTS IS HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT THE INCLUSION OR THE HISTORY OF. CALIFORNIA BEING THREE TIMES COLONIZED SO X. AGO I'M SORRY SPAIN MEXICO UNITED STATES AND HOW DO WE WILL WE'RE TRYING TO TALK WITH SOME OF MY MEDINA ABOUT ETHNIC STUDIES. HOW DO WE INCORPORATE- HELP SUGGEST THAT WE AS LEGISLATORS TACKLE THAT THAT SUBJECT. I'D I THINK ONE THING THAT I FIND REALLY IMPORTANT ABOUT CALIFORNIA IS TO CONSIDER IT AS- LIKE AN AMALGAM OF HISTORY SO ANYTHING THAT YOU CAN TALK ABOUT IT HISTORY ACTUALLY COMES TO. TO PLAY A LOT IN CALIFORNIA WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THE MISSION SYSTEM THAT WHAT HAPPENED WITH LIKE THE MEXICAN RANCHERAS SYSTEM AND THEN ALSO THE GOLD RUSH OTHER THINGS CONVERGE TOGETHER IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY ALSO HAPPEN IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. AND THEY AFFECT A LOT OF DIFFERENT PEOPLE SO WHEN YOU'RE TALKING BUT SAY A THE MISSION SYSTEM I'VE FINING REALLY INTERESTING MOMENTS OF THINKING ABOUT WHO ARE THE ACTUAL PEOPLE THAT ARE INVOLVED. IN THE SPANISH SIDE OF IT IF YOU LOOK AT THE SPANISH SOLDIERS WE HAVE AN ASSUMPTION OF WHO THEY MIGHT BE THEY TEND TO ACTUALLY BE. A LOT OF THEM ARE- LIKE PEOPLE OF COLOR IN SLAVE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE FORCED INTO THIS SOLDIER SYSTEM BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY TO GET TO MOVE UP THE CASTE SYSTEM. THERE'S A LOT REALLY INTERESTING MOMENTS TO THINK ABOUT THE INTERSECTION ALLERGY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY- AND I ACTUALLY THINK LEARNING ABOUT CALIFORNIA INDIAN HISTORY. LENDS ITSELF REALLY WELL TO ETHNIC STUDIES AS A CURRICULUM BECAUSE OF HOW INVOLVED- SO MANY DIFFERENT PEOPLE WERE IN THE BUILDING AS HAS. I THINK IT CAN IN MY MIND WE HAVE TO CENTER CALIFORNIA INDIANS FIRST BECAUSE WE ARE YOU OFTEN THEM. THE MOST ARE BASED SO THE ONES AT. I THINK ARE JUST IN THE PAST. AND WE NEED TO BILL ANY LIMIT THE FOR ALSO AN ACTIVE PART WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU OF FOR THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA. KIND OF FOLLOWING UP ON AN MISCARRY OF. I GREW UP- HI THIS NATIVE AMERICAN WORD MEANING NEST NOT SURE WHAT LANGUAGE VENTURA COUNTY. I REMEMBER AS A YOUNG MAN- MAKING MOCCASINS AND BEAT IT SO IN THE BEADS. AS A BOY SCOUT IN I GREW UP IN CATHOLIC SCHOOL BUILDING THE MISSIONS BUT I GROWING UP. IN OJAI THOUGHT THAT I HAD TO TRAVEL TO ARIZONA. IF I HAD INTEREST IN NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE. I WENT TO COLLEGE AND I GOT A MASTERS IN HISTORY OF WHICH I'M VERY PROUD OF. IT OF THE GETTING A MASTERS IN HISTORY AT UC RIVERSIDE A PLACE THAT THAT HAS- EXCELLENT PROGRAM AT NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY BUT I GO BACK TO HOW I GREW UP AND NOT EVEN KNOWING THE EXISTENCE LEARN ABOUT THE EXISTENCE. OF NATIVE AMERICANS IN. ELEVEN MILES WERE PROBABLY IN THE SAME PLACE WHERE I GREW UP- YOU KNOW IT WAS ONLY AFTER GETTING ELECTED TO THE LEGISLATURE I REALLY DO THINK THAT I LEARNED THE SHOE MUCH PEOPLE- INVENTOR AND THEIR HISTORY IN THE ISLANDS OFF THE COAST OF VENTURA. AND HAVE BEEN VERY WELL IMPRESSED WITH CHANNEL ISLANDS EFFORTS TO INCORPORATE LIKE YOU HAVE IN THE VIDEO SCIENCE A NATIVE AMERICAN EXISTENCE AND PRESENCE IN THE SCIENCE RESEARCH THAT THEY CONDUCT. IN THE CHANNEL ISLANDS. BUT I AM STILL- YOU KNOW IT IS SO UNFORTUNATE I BELIEVE AS AN EDUCATOR. AS A LEGISLATOR THAT THE TWELVE MINUTES OF VIDEO THAT YOU SHOWED HERE. IN MY LIFETIME WAS NEVER EVER. TALK TO ME SO THAT WHEN I LEARNED ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA MISSIONS. IT WAS ALMOST TO THE EXCLUSION OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN PEOPLE I RECOGNIZED I THINK A PICTURE OF THE BOARDING SCHOOL IT LOOK LIKE SHERMAN. INDIAN BOARDING SCHOOL THAT IS IN RIVERSIDE IN THE DISTRICT THAT I NOW REPRESENT AND I THINK THAT THERE WAS A PICTURE OF THEIR OF THE OF THE- OF THE BOARDING SCHOOL IN RIVERSIDE SO I VERY MUCH HOPE THAT IT IN OUR EFFORT TO CREATE A CURRICULA- OF ETHNIC STUDIES FOR THE HIGH SCHOOL THAT. THIS HISTORY NATIVE AMERICAN HISTORY I WILL BE YOU KNOW A. VERY MUCH CENTERED AS YOU SAID IN THAT CALIFORNIA HISTORY BECAUSE IT IS A CENTRAL PART OF THE HISTORY BUT UNFORTUNATELY IN MY LIFETIME WHEN THAT WAS NEVER EVEN MENTIONED. THANK YOU A SEVERE MEDINA ASSEMBLY WOMAN- MANAT MONIQUE LIMON HAS JOINED US THANK YOU AND I REGRET THAT HAD TO GET HERE LATE BUT AS TIMING WOULD HAVE IT'S A ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALMOST AND I WERE PRESENTING AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE ON A WAY TO FIND FUNDING TO CREATE AND NATIVE AMERICAN. CURRICULUM FOR K. TWELVE- AND IT WAS A BILL THAT PASSED A COUPLE YEARS AGO BUT THE FUNDING WASN'T THERE AND SO- A THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER ROBERTS HAS TALKED A BIT ABOUT. HOW YOU RECTIFY HISTORY AND IT'S NOT JUST TO SHOW INTENT BUT TO ALSO PROVIDE RESOURCES TO MAKE SOME OF THIS REALITY- I APPRECIATE YOUR HEARING- WHAT MORE WE CAN DO AND HOW DIFFERENTLY WE CAN THINK ABOUT PRESENTING AN UNTOLD HISTORY UNTOLD STORY THAT IS VERY MUCH PRESENT- IN VERY MUCH REAL- IT TO THE FIRST PEOPLE'S HERE. SO I THINK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND I REGRET THAT I HAD IN THIS VIDEO THAT EVERYONE'S REFERENCE- BUT BUT I DO THINK YOU OF FOR ENHANCING ADVANCING THIS CONVERSATION. AND I DID WANT TO POINT OUT ONE THING THAT I LEARNED A LOT FROM DOING THESE KINDS OF PRESENTATIONS IS HOW MUCH THE FOURTH GRADE MISSION PROJECT IN A IMPACTS ON HOW PEOPLE KNOW INDIAN PEOPLE AND SO. WHEN PEOPLE SAY OH IT'S JUST IN THE FOURTH GRADERS ALONG. WITH MY STUDENTS COME IN THAT'S WHAT THEY INTERNALIZED WAS THEIR FOURTH GRADE MISSION PROJECT AND EVEN IF IN HIGH SCHOOL THEY LEARNED AFTER THAT SOME OTHER THINGS ABOUT THE MISSIONS. THEY STILL REALLY TALK ABOUT FOR THE FOURTH GRADE IS VERY INFLUENTIAL ON THEM AS STUDENTS. AND SOMETIMES PEOPLE WORRY THAT YOU CAN'T TEACH THE REAL MISSION HISTORY IN THE FOURTH GRADE. BUT MY DAUGHTER- WHEN SHE HAD TO DO HER FOURTH GRADE MISSION PROJECT- DECIDED TO DO THE SAN DIEGO MISSION. AND WHAT SHE WAS GOING TO DO IS BUILD IT AND THEN SET IT ON FIRE AND THEN TURN IN THE ASHES OF THAT PROJECT BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT THE COOLEY I HAD DONE WHEN THEY REVOLTED THEY HAD SET THE MISSION ON FIRE. AND WE BOTH SAID IT WOULD BE HISTORICALLY ACCURATE- AND INSTEAD SHE BUILT THE MISSION AND PUT FLAMES UP THE SIDE AND SHE WROTE HER REPORT ABOUT THE COOLEY AYE REVOLTS AND RESISTANCE TO THE MISSION SYSTEM. ANSWERING ALL OF THE QUESTIONS OF THE FOURTH GRADE CURRICULUM BUT IN A WAY THAT CENTERED INDIGENOUS PEOPLES AND IT WAS VERY POWERFUL THE WATCHER DO THAT AND TO ALSO THEN SEE WHAT SHE SAID TO STUDENTS. SO I KNOW THAT FOURTH GRADERS CAN HANDLE IT AND I KNOW THAT WE CAN'T JUST TAKE OUT. THIS IDEA OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THESE COMPLEX CONVERSATIONS AND WHEN I ASKED HER LIKE DID IT MAKE YOU FOR SATURDAY THAT MAKE YOU THINK SOMETHING BAD AND SHE SAID NO. IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT CALIFORNIA INDIANS ARE REALLY STRONG PEOPLE. AND I WANT HER TO LEARN THAT FROM OUR STATE CURRICULUM I WANT ALL STUDENTS TO LEARN THAT. AND SHE WAS LIKE IT MADE ME REALIZE THAT WE WERE ALWAYS FIGHTING. AND THAT WE KNEW WE WERE GOING TO. OR SO SHE INTERNALIZES THAT OF THE MESSAGE OF WE WERE ALL DYING TO. WE WERE VERY VERY STRONG PEOPLE AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE SHOULD DO WITH OUR CURRICULUM IS EMPOWER ARE USED TO THINK ABOUT NATIVE PEOPLE THAT WAY. EXCELLENT THANK YOU AND I WANT TO GIVE A- SPECIAL RECOGNITION TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEMOND FOR AUTHORING WAS IT LAST YEAR THE BILL THAT ACTUALLY. THAT ACTUALLY TACKLED- THE MISSION PROJECT IN THE SUGAR CUBE PROJECT WHICH I ALSO DID- IN. THIRD OR FOURTH GRADE- REPRESENTATION MATTERS.

FROM THE GOVERNMENT GET THAT INDIAN MY. HAVE YOU SEEN A BECAUSE I HAVEN'T SEEN IT I HAVEN'T SEEN IT SO WHAT WE'LL BE TALKING A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT AND SOME OF THE OTHER THINGS HAVE BEEN GOING ON. FIRST OF ALL YOU'RE A- CULTURE RISEN THANK YOU DOCTOR ISN'T THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATION. AND I HAVE A TEN YEAR OLD SON WHO'S IN FOURTH GRADE. AND I'M ALSO GONNA DO THE SAN DIEGO MISSION. AND THE BURNING. AND ALL THE THINGS THAT WENT WITH THAT. BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE. ARE NOT VICTIMS. OUR PEOPLE HAVE RESISTED CONTINUE TO RESIST AND WE LIVE TODAY. SO. TO TALK ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED WE AS NATIVE PEOPLE HAVE HAD TO INDOOR THREE WAVES OF ENCROACHMENT. FIRST SUSPEND THEIR HERE FOR ABOUT FIFTY YEARS FOR FURTHER CAME OF SEPTEMBER TWENTY SEVENTH FIFTEEN FORTY TWO THEY DID A- THEY DO A PAGEANT IN SAN DIEGO EVERY SEPTEMBER CABRILLO COMING IN- THESE THAT PEOPLE DRESSED UP AS COOLEY AYE GENUINE SELECTING IN FRONT OF THEM THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN WILL HAPPEN ACTUALLY WAS A LOT OF THURMOND GOT SHOT BY COMMUNITIES. WHO ENCROACHING INTO OUR TERRITORY. AFTER THAT. THEY CAME BACK AGAIN AND SEVENTEEN SIXTY NINE THE MISSION WAS CREATED WAS BURNED DOWN NOVEMBER FIFTH SEVENTEEN SEVENTY FIVE. THE A DURING THE MEXICAN REVOLUTION MEXICO WAS FINALLY- GAINED INDEPENDENCE THEY WERE GONNA SECULARIZED EMISSION BUT THEY MAKE THESE ESTANCIAS TO COMBAT PEOPLE CONTINUED ATTACKS. SAN DIEGO MISSPELLED THREE TIMES TO CALL ME I TAX LAST TIME IT WAS REPELLED BY A BRITISH SCHOOL IN THE BAY. WELL THEN THE MEXICAN AMERICAN WAR CAME. UP TO ME AS TO ACTIVELY FIGHTING AGAINST MAX AND AMERICANS CAME- JOE KERN GOT. HE WAS STUCK IN SAN DIEGO WHO'S GOMEZ I CAME TO HIS AID THEY SAID THAT THEY WOULD. HELP THE NATIVE PEOPLE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO WIN THE WAR. WHEN THAT HAPPENED. GOVERNOR THE FIRST GOVERNOR HERE THE CALIFORNIA HE WAS THE ONE THAT STARTED THE GENOCIDE UNAIDED NATIVE PEOPLE THAT WAS FOLLOWED BY GOVERNMENT DO. WHAT HAPPENED THEN WAS AN M. PRIOR TO THE GOLD RUSH THE NATIVE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA OF. THE POPULATION WAS 80% OF THE STATE. AND SOMETHING ABOUT CALIFORNIA IS CALIFORNIA HAS MORE LANGUAGE AND CULTURAL DIVERSITY THAN ANY OTHER PLACE IN THE WORLD ASIDE FROM PAPUA NEW GUINEA. THAT SPEAKS. TO THE DIVERSITY HERE IN THE STATE AND YOU KNOW OF EVERYTHING THAT WENT WITH IT. A FEW YEARS AFTER GOLD RUSH. 80% OF THE PEOPLE WERE GONE. THEY HAD BEEN KILLED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT GENOCIDE IT WAS I MEAN AN INCREDIBLE PROPORTIONS. SCHWARZKOPF CAME SO HE WAS HIRED BY BY STATE TO DEVELOP EIGHTEEN TREES TO MAKE EIGHTEEN TREATIES. THE TREATY OF SET I BELIEVE- MISTER RAMOS SURE WERE YOU UNDER THE TREATY OF TEMECULA ARE YOU YOUR UNDER DIFFERENT TREATY. WAS A DIFFERENT ONE THAN THE TREE OF TEMECULA CAME. OKAY AND THEN THE TREATY OF SAN ISABLLE CAME IT WAS- IT WAS SIGNED JANUARY SEVENTH 1-540-184-0218 FIFTY TWO. AND A PROMISES A RESERVATION FROM THE MEXICAN BORDER BUT A VERY CLOSE TO RIVERSIDE COUNTY. THIS WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A RESERVATION AND THE RESERVATIONS WERE CREATED IN ORDER TO GIVE THE NATIVE PEOPLE. AN OPPORTUNITY. TO I MEAN TO LIVE WE HAD THE RESOURCES THE ENVIRONMENTAL RESOURCE OF WHAT WE COULD SUPPORT OURSELVES. WHAT IS EIGHTEEN TREATIES WERE NOT RATIFIED. HUGE LANGRES TOOK PLACE IN YOU GOTTA REMEMBER THIS WAS ON THE EVE OF THE CIVIL WAR. SO LET OF PEOPLE COMING INTO CALIFORNIA HAD CONFEDERATE LEANINGS. SO WHAT WAS GOING ON WAS THEY WERE BASICALLY PETITIONING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT IF YOU SEND US. YOUR TREATED FOR GOING TO SIDE WITH THE CONFEDERACY. SO THOSE TREATED TO NEVER RATIFIED. SO WHAT HAPPENED WAS AND OUR PEOPLE DID NOT ABROGATE ON ANY PROVISIONS OF THOSE TREES WE NEVER BROKEN PROVISIONS WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE STATE GOVERNMENT HUGE LAND GRABS TOOK PLACE. SO WHAT SAVED US WELL I'M I'M NOT EVEN AS A SAVED AS WHAT HAPPENED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE RESERVATIONS CAME BY EXECUTIVE ORDER. THAT CAME FROM ULYSSES S. GRANT. AND. SEN THE RESERVATIONS THAT WERE CREATED AN IF ANY OF YOU ARE AWARE OF SAN DIEGO SAN DIEGO AS MORE RESERVATIONS IN ANY OTHER COUNTY IN THE COUNTRY WE HAVE A- RESERVATIONS. WELL SAID THE SMALLEST RESERVE A- BUT THESE DIVISIONS THAT WERE CREATED WERE NOT CREATED FOR US TO BE SELF SUFFICIENT. THERE CREATED BASICALLY TO TELL US TO QUESTION THE PEOPLE. AND I'M SURE THE RESERVATIONS UPPER WERE EVEN SMALLER. SO WITH THAT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE HERO WITH THE PEOPLE WELL AS- YOU KNOW YOU LIVE IN A CERTAIN AREA. AND LARGE ENOUGH POPULATION SMALL ENOUGH AREA YOU'RE GONNA DEPLETE THE RESOURCES OF THAT AREA SO WHAT IS HAPPENING DâN. THE BUREAU OF INDIAN AFFAIRS TO THE ANY COMMISSIONS WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING IN SUPPLIES. MANY OF THOSE SUPPLIES WENT TO THE GOLD RUSH. TO SUPPLY PEOPLE TO SUPPLY PEOPLE OUT THERE PEOPLE WERE STARVING ON THE RESERVATION PEOPLE HAD TO GO AND- ENGAGING CATTLE RUSTLING OR DOING WHATEVER THEY COULD IN ORDER TO FEED THE FAMILIES THIS IS HOW BAD IT GOT. AND ALSO SOME DATA AB ONE EIGHTEEN SEVENTIES EIGHTEEN EIGHTY. THIS WAS THE START OF THE BOARDING SCHOOL ERA COLONEL PRESS. HE'S THE ONE THAT MADE THE FAMOUS SAYING KILL THE INDIAN AND SAVE THE MAN THEY WERE TAKING CHILDREN AWAY FROM THE COMMUNITIES AND THIS WAS HAPPENING OF AS LATE AS THE NINETEEN FORTIES NINETEEN FIFTIES. I KNOW IT TOOK AWAY AND THEY WILL CUT THEIR HAIR. AND. WHEN I TALK ABOUT CUTTING THE HAIR IT MEANS MORE THAN THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THIS. THIS IS PART OF WHO WE ARE IN OUR CREATION STORIES WE HAVE THE SAME CREATION STORIES. IT TALKS ABOUT THE WILDCAT HAD A LONG TAIL BUT WHEN THE CREATOR DIED BECAUSE STILL IN MOURNING SO WE DO THAT SO WHEN YOU CUT SOMEBODY'S HERE YOU. YOU PUT SOMEBODY IN MORNING. YOU PUT SOMEBODY A AND A SENSE OF LAWS. pWHAT IT WAS ILLEGAL FOR US TO PRACTICE OUR RELIGION. AND IT WAS ILLEGAL TO PRACTICE OUR I'M TO SPEAK OUR LANGUAGE. IT WASN'T UNTIL THE FREEDOM OF AMERICAN INDIAN RELIGION ACT WAS PASSED IN AUGUST ELEVENTH OF NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. THAT WE HAD THE SAME PROTECTION AS ANYBODY ELSE. AS EVERYBODY ELSE IN THIS COUNTRY. AND WAS UNTIL THE NINETEEN NINETIES THERE ARE LANGUAGES WERE PROTECTED. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT WE HAD. NO OTHER RESERVATIONS IS A SAID WE KNOW WE DO OF. IT WAS DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO SUSTAIN ON THAT RESERVATION THE LANDS THAT WERE PUT. REMEMBER OUR PEOPLES WERE FROM THE COAST ALL THE WAY TO THE DESERT. SO THE BEST LANDS THE NATIVE PEOPLE REJECTED WERE FORCIBLY REMOVED PUSHED ON TO THESE LANDS HAD NOBODY WANTED. THESE LANDS AT WERE VERY DIFFICULT TO SUSTAIN. SO AS THIS STARTED HAPPENING. THE GOVERNMENT CAME IN AND THEY WERE TAKING CHILDREN AWAY FOR THE BOARDING SCHOOLS THEY WERE COMING BACK MANY OF THEM DID WHAT I CALL COACH WHICH THEY WOULD SPEAK IN THE LANGUAGE AND THEN WHEN THE WHEN AND IT WOULD BE PUNISHED FOR SPEAKING THEIR LANGUAGE THEY WERE TALKING ENGLISH TO THEM. BUT WHAT THEY IT HAD A DELAYED AFFECT WHAT WOULD HAPPEN WAS WHEN THEY WENT HOME THEY WOULD TELL THEIR SIBLINGS YOU'RE GONNA BE GOING TO BOARDING SCHOOL NEXT DON'T TALK OUR LANGUAGE THEY'RE GOING TO HURT YOU JUST TALK IN ENGLISH SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT. THAT WERE TAKING PLACE. NOW REMEMBER I TOLD YOU- THE FREEDOM OF AMERICAN INTO RELIGION ACT WAS. WAS WAS PASSED IN AUGUST ELEVENTH NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THIS. PROTECTION OF LANGUAGE CULTURE AND RELIGION. MEANS NOTHING IF YOU HAVE NO MORE LANGUAGE CULTURE RELIGION LEFT TO PROTECT. THEY WERE STILL I MEAN IT WAS IT YOU KNOW THEY WERE STILL IN OF PIECES OF IT GOING. NO WE TALKED ABOUT YOUR TEACHER. AND YOU KNOW HOW HE KEPT IT GOING. SO BACK TO THE RESERVATIONS THE RESERVATION TO A HARD PLACE TO LIVE ON. WAS VERY DIFFICULT AND NO RUNNING WATER NO ELECTRICITY ON THE SENATE BY RESERVATION I REMEMBER- A JIM WAS MADE. AND THAT WAS THE PLACE WHERE PEOPLE WOULD COME AND TAKE SHOWERS TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE SOMETIMES IT WILL COME TO COOK. IT WAS A HARD PLACE TO LIVE. AND MY UNCLE HE TOLD ME WHEN HE WENT TO BOARDING SCHOOL. HE SAID THAT HE WAS TAKEN ALL THE WAY TO- THEY HAD SEEN BOND OFFICE. A IN IN BANNING AND THEN THEY ALSO HAD SAN FRANCISCO IN ARIZONA. AND THEY WOULD TAKE- NATIVE CHILDREN TO THE DIFFERENT DIVISIONS MANY OF THEM ESCAPED. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE PROBLEMS THAT THAT WE HAD THERE. ALSO IN OUR COMMUNITIES NATIVE COMMUNITIES ON THE RESERVATION. DEVELOPING THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN ORDER TO SUPPORT THE POPULATION. WITHOUT ELECTRICITY WITHOUT RUNNING WATER IT CAN BE DIFFICULT AND PEOPLE TEND TO CONGREGATE WHERE THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THE SERVICES ALSO ANOTHER THING THAT'S HAPPENING THAT YOU ALL KNOW OF IS WE ARE GOING INTO A DROUGHT OR WELL IT'S ON A RESERVATIONS ARE SEARCHING HOWEVER BECAUSE WE'RE ON A FAULT LINE THAT WATER IS GOING INTO THE- INTO LAKE HENSHAW. AS GOING INTO THE VISTA WATER DISTRICT SO IT'S SERVING MEMBERS IN COMMUNITY HOWEVER WITH THE WATER THAT'S COMING FROM US WE ARE NOT ABLE TO GET THAT WATER TO HELP OUR PEOPLE. OTHER THINGS LANGUAGE THERE. BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED TO CREATE LANGUAGE PROGRAMS FOR FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND THIS IS HELPING US. HOWEVER IT'S DIFFICULT IF ANY OF YOU- SPEAK MORE THAN ONE LANGUAGE YOU KNOW THAT THE ONLY WAY TO REALLY- A REVIVAL LANGUAGE A REVERSE LANGUAGE SHIFT IS TO IMMERSION. REAL QUICK ON THE NUMBERS O MY PEOPLE ON BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER OF THE UNITED STATES AND MEXICO THERE'S FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FOUR. NINE OF THAT FOUR THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR THERE'S APPROXIMATELY FORTY THREE WAS TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE. AND MOST OF MARIN BAJA. SO IN ORDER TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS WHERE WE CREATED COOLEY AYE COMMUNITY COLLEGE. FOR EDUCATION BECAUSE OUR PEOPLE WERE NOT LEARNING OUR STORY THEY WERE NOT LEARNING OUR HISTORY IN THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR US. YOU SEE YOU KNOW YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE MISSIONS AND HOW YOU LEARN ALL THE INDIANS LOVED IT WHICH WAS A YOU KNOW A- THE TOTAL FALSE. WE'RE DIGITAL CULTURE WE'RE TEACHING OUR HISTORY. AND NOW WE WANT TO BRANCH OFF. WE WANTED NO JUST LIKE WHAT YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT. YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW GET THIS YOU KNOW. GET OUR OUR OUR STORY. YOU KNOW TEACHING THE STORY ABOUT THE MISSIONS AND A GOLD RUSH IN THE ATROCITIES THAT TOOK PLACE TO THE PEOPLE IN THE- THE TRUE STORY. SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THOSE FEW DAYS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR. ME THE TIME TO SPEAK TO ALL OF YOU. AND AS WE SAY IN MY LANGUAGE. THE BUYER COME UP SHORT. NOBLE MONEY WITHOUT NEW YORK CON KNOW WHAT ARTICLE HON. THE BILL LATER J. AKON RESUME TO CREATE A WATCH OVER ALL OF YOU AS YOU CONTINUE TO WALK THIS PATH. THIS PAST OF TRUTH. A STRAIGHT PATH. AND THE CREATOR BLUSHING THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M DOCTOR STANLEY FOR THAT- DISCUSSION AND TRUE FACTUAL DISCUSSION OF THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE AND THE SEVENTY EIGHT WHEN CULTURE THEN WAS COMING FOR WHAT CULTURE WAS LEFT BECAUSE OF THE CHASTISING THE TOOK PLACE AGAINST PEOPLE WITHIN THOSE BOARDING SCHOOLS ARE SPEAKING THEIR OWN LANGUAGE ONE OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT FORWARD AND EXPLAINING THE FEDERAL PROCESS OF HOW- SOME TRIBES HAVE THE FOR RECOGNITION- WITH US ALSO IS- ASSEMBLY WOMAN BLANCA RUBIO. JUST JOINED US. THANK YOU THANK YOU. YEAH THANK YOU I WAS- WATCHING AND I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR THAT I WAS A FOURTH GRADE TEACHER FOR ABOUT EIGHT YEARS PRIOR TO COME TO THE ASSEMBLY AND I WAS ONE OF THE TEACHERS DAD HAD TO ASSIGN THE MISSION PROJECT AND I ALWAYS TRY TO EMPHASIZE TO MY STUDENTS THAT- THEY DIDN'T HAVE TO PAY COMMISSION THEY COULD PICK THE TRIED THAT WAS NEAR THAT MISSION AND TELL THEIR STORY AND I A- MEXICAN AMERICAN I WAS BORN IN MEXICO AND PRETTY WHEN I WAS A KID SO I KNOW YOU KNOW A LITTLE BIT OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH BUT- I'M GONNA TALK TO MY STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR I'M ACTUALLY. YOU KNOW ABOUT WHAT ARE THE OF AMERICA WE'RE GOING. ANOTHER THING. CHAIR IS THAT STORIES HISTORY BOOKS ARE NEVER IN BY THE LOSER. IT'S ALWAYS WEBER ONE. IT WOULD GETS TO TELL THE STORY OF WHATEVER IT MAY BE AND SOUL SO TRYING TO CHANGE THAT I WOULD ASK THEM TO DO RESEARCH ON THE TRIBE THAT WAS NEAR WHATEVER THE MISSION THAT THEY WERE CHOOSING- BUT UNFORTUNATELY THOSE STORIES ARE. ARE VERY MINIMAL YOU KNOW WE NEED TO EXPERTS AND- TO GO TO ACTUAL RESERVATIONS TO GET THE TRUE STORY SO EVEN THE RESEARCH THAT THEY WOULD DEAL WITH STILL. YOU KNOW THEY WERE FINE. THEY WERE GREAT- BUT SO I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND ALSO AS A SECOND LANGUAGE LEARNER I UNDERSTAND. THE VALUE OF THE IMMERSION. HOWEVER WHAT CAN WE DO YOU KNOW IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO TRY AND HELP REVIVE THOSE LANGUAGES I HAVE BEEN TO SEVERAL RESERVATIONS WHERE. WHERE THEY'RE DOING THEIR OWN YOU KNOW THEY HAVE THEIR OWN CURRICULUM THEIR OWN YOU KNOW FLASH CARDS ALL OF THAT. BUT IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO. HELP IN THAT. TRYING TO REVIVE YOUR LANGUAGES. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP. AS FAR AS LIKE TO NOTE DEVELOPING CURRICULUM CURRICULUM DEVELOPMENT AND AS I SAID EARLIER CALIFORNIA'S SUCH A DIVERSE STATE. IT IS IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO WORK WITH THE NATIVE GROUPS IN THE AREA TO GET AN ACCURATE I MEAN AN ACTOR DEPICTION OF THE HISTORY. AS FAR AS LANGUAGE THIS IS A WHEN I THINK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT COOLEY AYE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS WE'VE pACCREDITED CLASSES AND WE'VE BEEN BRINGIN IN HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. SO WHAT THEY DO IS RATHER THAN TAKING SPANISH OR ANOTHER THEY'RE TAKING THEIR OWN NATIVE LANGUAGE AND THEY'RE THEY'RE LEARNING THAT AND AS THE ACCOUNTS FOR NOT JUST FOR HIGH SCHOOL CREDIT BUT ALSO FOR COLLEGE CREDIT. SO BEING SUPPORTIVE OF THAT CAN BE IN SUPPORT OF A NATIVE EDUCATION. AND GOING AND VISITING THE DIFFERENT COMMUNITIES IN THE AREA YOU KNOW GIVING THEM A VOICE. THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU. SO NO ONE COULD YOU I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- YOU MENTIONED THAT THERE YOUR. THERE'S POPULATIONS IN BAJA SO AND THE COUNTRY OF MEXICO. ASSEMBLYMEMBER YOU CHAIR THE BY THE BY NATIONAL COMMITTEE ON RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN CALIFORNIA AND MEXICO RIGHT AND THIS IS THE NEW PRESIDENT OF MEXICO I'M LOW JUST ESTABLISH FOR THE FIRST TIME THE FIRST- MEXICAN INDIGENOUS OUT COMMISSION. THAT WOULD- ADDRESS ISSUES ON CULTURE LANGUAGE- TRADITION- AND REALLY- RECOGNITION AND I I'D IDENTITY AND I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THAT IN SOME WAY WITH THE BY NATIONAL COMMITTEE. IF I MAY IN SEPTEMBER- WE'RE GONNA CONVENE TO THAT- WE'RE GONNA CONVENE LEGISLATORS OF BOTH SIDES OF THE BORDER. THE CALIFORNIA- THE ALL THE U. S. MEXICAN BORDER. AND LEGISLATORS FROM THE FROM FROM THAT SIDE OF THE BORDER AS WELL AND- I WILL BE CHAIRING THAT THAT- GATHERING AND- CERTAINLY THIS MIGHT BE A TOPIC THAT I CAN PRESENT- FOR DISCUSSION AT THE SEPTEMBER THE GATHERING OF LEGISLATORS FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE US MEXICAN BORDER- WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF DEVELOPING THAT PROGRAM. AND WITH YOUR HELP I WOULD VERY BE VERY HAPPY TO TRY TO INCORPORATE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. FOR OUR SEPTEMBER GATHERING. OF AND WHEN IT WAS THANK YOU BOTH FOR- FOR YOUR COMMENTS YOU KNOW JUST WHAT YOU'RE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT- I JUST WANNA SAY YOU DON'T WANT TO LOSE ALTHOUGH THAT'S OUT THERE ABOUT WHAT'S GOING ON. WELL MILLION BONTA. A GET US OUT OF WILL WOULDN'T WHEN CALLISTO IDEA FOR A BOILER THE HINT THERE YEAH THE HAND IN THE CAN A- LOCAL GUY BY BY KEY NEW LOCAL TO ME. THE COCOPAH. THIS IS A DOES OUR LOCAL NO OBVIOUSLY. SO THESE ARE SOME OF THE THINGS THAT YES WE CAN TALK ABOUT WE DO WORK AND ALSO PASS AND WE PASSED. THAT IS A BIG PROBLEM THAT THAT WE HAVE AT TIMES- OF- YOU KNOW WHAT ONE OF THE THINGS YOU'RE AT THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER CUT RIGHT THROUGH. COOLEY AYE TERRITORY SO THE YOU KNOW AND- SOME OF MY RAMOS YOU KNOW WHEN WE GET TOGETHER WHEN WE'RE SINGING AT WICKS AND WE NEED SINGER SO CALM. THERE'S MANY TIMES THE REASON I LEARNED AS SPEAKS SPANISH WAS I GO I'M A SINGER AND I GO DOWN TO BOTHER TO GO SOON- BUT I CAN TELL YOU GOTTEN THAT LOTUS. TO SING IN THE WICKS. AND IT IS IMPORTANT YOU KNOW TO HAVE THAT TO HAVE THAT CONNECTION. WE SAY OUR CULTURE IS LIKE A NICE GUY A POT THAT WAS SHATTERED. AND EACH COMMUNITY HAS A PIECE OF THAT. WHEN WE COME TOGETHER WE MAKE A STRONG BUT YES I WOULD LOVE TO. TO WORK WITH WHAT YOU. KNOW THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION AND- THE REALISTIC RIGHT OUT OF THE BORDERS AND NOW WE SEE- THE UNITED STATES WE SEE THE BORDERS OF THEIR STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOWEVER BACK IN TIME THERE WAS NO BORDERS AND PEOPLE FREELY ROAM. ON FOLLOWING THE PLANT LIFE FOLLOWING LIFE OF CULTURE THAT'S THERE AND IT BY PEOPLE AND NO DOES NOT KNOW THOSE BORDERS RIGHT THE CULTURE STILL EXIST. WHEN IT THANK YOU- FOR THAT PRESENTATION OUR NEXT- SPEAKER. IS MERRY LOPEZ KEY FOR. A MEMBER OF THE SAN LUIS REY BAND OF MISSION INDIANS AND COMMISSIONER. AND SECRETARY FOR THE CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION. SHALL SPEAK TO THE PERSPECTIVE OF NON FAYE RECOGNIZED INDIAN TRIBES. AND IT REALLY GOES- IN SYNC WITH WITH YOUR PRESENTATION WE TALK ABOUT BORDERS AND BOUNDARIES WE SEE THOSE AREAS NOW TODAY PHILLY RECOGNIZED BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT. CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE AS A WHOLE THAT WHEN THE FIRST EXPLORATION STARTED COME THROUGH WITH THE RUSHED IN THE SPANISH AND THEN THE MEXICAN RULE. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT A HIGH POPULATION OF CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE THEN CAME THE GOLD RUSH 80% DWINDLE DOWN. SO MERRY LOPEZ- KEY FOR. WILL BE ABLE. TO GUIDE US THROUGH THAT DISCUSSION. FOR THAT'S NOT A LOT. AND GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME AT CHAIRMAN RAMOS MEMBERS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE- BEING INVITED TO TALK ABOUT CALIFORNIA NOT REALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND IT'S A LARGE GROUP- YOU'VE YOU PROBABLY KNOW THAT THERE IS TO ADD DISTINCT TYPE OF TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED AND NOT REALLY RECOGNIZED OTHERS A HUNDRED AND NINE. OF FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND THEIR SIXTY TWO NINE PHILLY RECOGNIZE TRIBES I AM CURRENTLY ON THE LIST OF TRIBES MAINTAINED BY THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION. AND SO NOT BARELY RECOGNIZED TRIBES REPRESENT A THIRD OF TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA. AND IT BEGS THE QUESTION WHAT WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE AND WHY- BECAUSE AT JUST AS AS YOU GREW UP ASSEMBLYMEMBER MEDINA- YEAR EXPERIENCE IS VERY COMMON- SOMETIMES FAIRLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES DON'T KNOW THE EXISTENCE OF NON BARELY RECOGNIZED TRIBES- BEAN INVISIBLE. IS A REALITY AND TRYING TO BREAK THAT INVISIBILITY IS SOMETHING TRIBES NOT FOR THE RECOGNIZE TRIES WORK TOWARDS EVERY DAY. AS YOU KNOW MY NAME IS MERRY LOPEZ KIEFER- I EMPIRE WE KITCHEN WHICH IS LISTEN YOU. I AM A MEMBER OF THE SAN LUIS REY BANNER MISSION INDIANS IT IS ONE OF SEVEN THE SANYO TRIBES- YOUR TRIBES IN OUR TERRITORY WHO ARE ALL FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED. OUR TRIBE IS NOT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED MAINLY BECAUSE WE WOULD NOT LEAVE OUR VILLAGE. OF KATJA WHICH IS WHY YOU HAVE THE SALAS THREE MISSION. THE KING OF THE MISSIONS- IT WAS OUR VILLAGE THAT MADE THEM WANT TO MAKE THEIR FISH MISSION THERE AND. IT WAS AN UNDERSTANDING WITH THROUGH THE TREATY A TO MACULA THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO STAY THERE- WHEN THE TRIBES PARTICULARLY SALAS RACE SIGN THAT TREATY A TO MACULAR WHICH IS ALSO KNOWN AS TREATY QUE. IT WAS EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND THE TREATY'S FATE WAS NOT KNOWN TO THE TRIBES UNTIL THEY WERE UNSEALED IN NINETEEN OH FIVE. IN ME BETWEEN THAT TIME YOU HAD THE LANDS CLAIM ACT- YOU HAD THE LAND COMMISSION COMING DOWN THE TRIBES TO NOT MAKE LAND CLAIMS BECAUSE WE HAD TREATIES. ABOUT WHERE OUR LAND WISE AND IT WASN'T UNTIL THE NINETEEN HUNDREDS WHERE MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WHO WAS THE CAPTAIN OF OUR TRIBE AT OUR VILLAGE. WE WERE FORCEFULLY EVICTED. BECAUSE OR LAND WAS VERY VALUABLE WE ARE ON THE COAST IT'S NOW KNOWN AS THE CITY OF OCEANSIDE. AND WE HAD. MANY AGRICULTURAL LANDS THAT WE HAD WORKED AND HAD NEVER LEFT WE WERE THAT VILLAGE WAS OURS. OUR HOME SINCE TIME IMMEMORIAL. TODAY SALAS REYES- ANCESTRAL TERRITORY WHERE WE ARE ARE ACTIVELYENGAGED WITH THE- GOVERNMENTS WITHIN THAT TERRITORY IS COMPILED TEN CITY OF OCEANSIDE CITY OF CARLSBAD CITY THAN SYNODUS. THIS THE SAN MARCOS ESCONDIDO AN UNINCORPORATED COMMUNITIES WITHIN NORTHERN COUNTY SAN DIEGO. AS A COMMISSIONER ON THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE pCOMMISSION I AM PRIVILEGED AND THAT I GET TO INTERACT WITH A LOT OF OTHER TRIBES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED NOT REALLY RECOGNIZED BUT I HAVEN'T REALLY DEFINED WHAT A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE IS- AT FAIRLY RECOGNIZE TRIED HAS A SPECIAL TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH THE- US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. THEY ARE RECOGNIZED AS SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY ARE OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT FOR HOUSING EDUCATION ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND HEALTH CARE. NOT FOR THE RECOGNIZED TRIBES ARE NOT PROVIDED THESE- RESOURCES- BECAUSE WE DO NOT HAVE THAT TRUST RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. IN ORDER TO HAVE THAT TYPE OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOT BARELY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN CALIFORNIA WOULD HAVE TO APPLY FOR FEDERAL RECOGNITION PETITION ACKNOWLEDGEMENT. TO DO SO WOULD BE HAVING TO ENGAGE IN TO AN INCREDIBLY FLAWED PROCESS THAT IS ACTUALLY A DESIGNED TO NOT ALLOW US TO BE BETTER RECOGNIZED AND THIS WAS EVIDENCED IN THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN FINAL REPORT BY THE ADVISORY COUNCIL ON CALIFORNIA INDIANS TO THE US CONGRESS- AND THAT WAS IN OVER TWO DECADES AGO. IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. BUT GIVEN THAT I TRIED TO JUST TO TERMINATION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANT TO PETITION FOR FEDERAL RECOGNITION IS REALLY AN IS A QUESTION ON THAT GOES TO THEIR OWN SOVEREIGNTY- THEIR INHERENT SOVEREIGN- DECISION TO DECIDE WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR PEOPLE. YOU MAY NOT KNOW A FEDERAL RECOGNITION APPLICATION. CAN COST UP TO TWO MILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE OF WHAT IS ENTAILED IN IT THE NASA CITY FOR PROFESSIONAL HISTORIANS ANTHROPOLOGISTS ARCHAEOLOGISTS GEOGRAPHERS JEAN GENEALOGISTS ON THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WON'T TAKE YOUR WORD FOR IT. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE REGULATIONS ARE WRITTEN IN A WAY THAT WILL NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ITS OWN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S ROLE OR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIANS ROLE IN THE GENOCIDE- OF CALIFORNIA INDIANS SO TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THOSE REGULATIONS. IT'S IN AN IMPOSSIBLE FEAT SO. IT'S A TRIBES DECISION TO FILE A PETITION. IT WAS REALLY GOES TO THEIR OWN- DECISION AS A SOVEREIGN GOVERNMENT TO DECIDE IF THAT'S IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THEIR PEOPLE BECAUSE- IF YOU HAVE MONEY. WHAT IF YOU WANT TO SPEND IT ON LANGUAGE PROGRAMS CULTURAL PROGRAMS CREATING A PLACE FOR YOU ALL TO GATHER WHERE IT'S SAFE- OR OR DO YOU WANT TO. GO FOR FEDERAL RECOGNITION. HI IT'S AN INCREDIBLY PERSONAL DECISION FOR THE TRIED. SO ANY TIME YOU SEE- REQUIREMENTS THAT TO BE CONSIDERED A TRY BE HAVE TO BE PETITIONING FOR FEDERAL RECOGNITION- I JUST ASK YOU TO TAKE THAT IN CONSIDERATION- BECAUSE THAT MAY NOT BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE TRIBE. IT DOESN'T MAKE THEM LESS OF A TRIBE. ON SOME OF THE BIGGEST STRUGGLES. FACING ON FAIRLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES IN MY OPINION BECAUSE I CAN'T SPEAK TO EVERYONE. PLEASE DON'T ASK ME TO. BESIDES THAT THE PERVERSE FEDERAL RECOGNITION- PROCESS IS ONE NOT HAVING THE ECONOMIC RESOURCES TO PRESERVE THE CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL HERITAGE- AND LACKING PROTECTION SPECIFICALLY I TO KEEP THEM THEIR CHILDREN. AT IN THEIR TRIBAL COMMUNITIES UNDER THE INDIAN WELL FOR CHILD. WELFARE ACT ALSO KNOWN AS A BLACK. BEING ABLE TO. I'M GONNA TACKLE THE FIRST BECAUSE THE OTHER ONE IS PRETTY INVOLVED. RIGHT NOW UNDER CALIFORNIA'S WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION THREE OH SIX POINT SIX THE COURTS ARE ALLOWED- DISCRETION AS TO WHETHER OR NOT A NOT REALLY RECOGNIZE TRIED CAN BE INVOLVED IN DEPENDENCY PROCEEDINGS. FOR A AT AN INDIAN CHILD THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED AN INDIAN. UNDER A GLASS IF BUT FOR THE POLITICAL STATUS OF THEIR TRIED. THIS DISALLOWS TRIBES TO TRULY BE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING THAT IS INHERENT TO THEIR ABILITY TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN AND THE MEMBERS OF THEIR TRIBES. SO ONE OF THE BIG STRUGGLES IS WHY IS THAT DISCRETIONARY. AND I KNOW JUST FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE BY BEING THE TRIBE'S CHIEF LEGAL COUNSEL WE HAVE REQUESTED INVOLVEMENT ON SEVERAL ISSUES BUT BECAUSE IT IS THE COURTS. DISCRETION IF WE ARE GOING TO BE INVOLVED OR NOT WE ARE NOT. SO THAT'S ONE OF THE STRUGGLES IS HOW HOW CAN WE STAY IN A COMMUNITY. AND BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR MEMBERS AND OUR CHILDREN- IF SUCH INVOLVEMENT IS NOT AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT. AS FAR AS. THAT THE LACK OF ECONOMIC RESOURCES TO TRULY PROTECT AND PRESERVE OUR CULTURAL AND SPIRITUAL LEGACIES AND- IS IT GOES TO. IT GOESBACK TO OUR HISTORY AS NON RECOGNIZED TRIBES WE DON'T HAVE A LAND BASE- WE HAVE A LOT OF EMPTY PROMISES THAT WERE GIVEN TO US THAT WE SHOULD HAVE PLANNED- AND IT'S NOT A COINCIDENCE THAT YOUR LARGEST MATCH OF TOP METROPOLITAN AREAS HAVE NO FAMILY RECOGNIZED TRIBES LOS ANGELES SAN FRANCISCO- AND IT'S NO ACCIDENT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES ALONG. SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA'S COAST. AND WE WERE THERE- IN FACT WE ARE STILL THERE. IN FACT A MAJORITY OF NON FAIRLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES STILL LIVE WITHIN THEIR ANCESTRAL TERRITORY- WHICH I'M SURE YOU CAN IMAGINE IS NO SMALL FEAT GIVEN HOW EXPENSIVE IT IS TO LIVE IN THE STATE- WE ARE BUSINESS OWNERS WERE TEACHERS ARE MUSICIANS. WE ARE SCHOLARS WERE LAWYERS ON AND WE'RE MECHANICS. WE ARE IN BAD IT- WE'VE NEVER LEFT AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ALWAYS. HOW WE LIKE TO PRESENT OURSELVES TO THE GOVERNMENT'S THAT WE HAVE TO WORK WITH. IN OUR CULTURE LIVES THROUGH S. BECAUSE IT'S A LIVING CULTURE. I AND SO IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE BE ABLE TO- HAVE. LANGUAGE PROGRAMS IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WERE ABLE TO RECLAIM WHAT HAD BEEN FORCEFULLY TAKEN FROM US I BELIEVE- DOCTOR RODRIGUEZ AND MENTIONED. THAT THERE WAS A LANGUAGE PROGRAM BUT ONLY FOR FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES- AND THAT'S A SHAME GIVEN THAT WE ARE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE SUCH A HISTORY THAT'S FRAUGHT WITH VIOLENCE AND TOWARDS OUR OUR NATIVE PEOPLE BUT THAT'S THE KIND OF PROGRAMS THAT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE TO ALL CALIFORNIA INDIANS AND ALL TRIBES. BECAUSE. I'M NOT REALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE SHOULDN'T BE TREATED AS A SECOND CLASS GOVERNMENT A SECOND CLASS CITIZEN IF YOU'RE A MEMBER OF A TRIBE- WE NEED TO BE SEEN WE NEED TO BE HEARD. BECAUSE OUR STORIES. AND OUR HISTORY IS ARE THE SAME AS ARE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED- COUNTERPARTS. WE ALL WERE. VICTIMS OF ATTEMPTED GENOCIDE- MY GRANDFATHER MY GREAT GRANDFATHER WHO I MENTION WAS OUR CAPTAIN WOULD TELL HIS CHILDREN TELL HIS GRANDCHILDREN DO NOT TELL ANYONE WHO YOU ARE DON'T TELL THEM YOU'RE INDIAN ARE YOU WILL BE TAKEN TO BOARDING SCHOOL- AND THAT STOCK. SO TO MY MOTHER AND HER SISTERS WOULDN'T SAY BECAUSE THEY WERE TOLD BY THEIR LEADER DON'T- AND BECAUSE THEY HAD COUSINS WHO WERE TAKEN- AND SO MY GENERATION REPRESENTS THE FIRST ONE. THAT CAN BE PROBABLY INDIGENOUS BECAUSE MY GRANDMOTHER WAS NOT ALLOWED TO BE. AND WE FIGHT EVERY DAY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRESENCE IS KNOWN BECAUSE I YOU SAID WE'RE STILL HERE. SOME OF THE EXAMPLES OF WHERE. WHERE WERE CONFLICTED OR WE'RE WE'RE BATTLING THE STRUGGLES IS THAT. WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR THE PASSAGE OF AB FIFTY TWO- REQUIRING LEAD H. SEEK RELIEF AGENCIES TO CONSULT WITH TRIBES EARLY ON IN THE PROCESS OF LAND DEVELOPMENT SO THAT IF OUR- TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCES ARE GOING TO BE NEGLEYIMPACTED THERE'S A REAL CHANCE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT CAN BE MODIFIED TO AVOID THAT IMPACT- IN UNFORTUNATELY- TROUBLE REPRESENTATIVES. IN ORDER TO HAVE TRUE IMPACT YOU HAVE TO HAVE MULTIPLE MEETINGS. WITH OUR PLANNERS LEE AND DECISION MAKERS- TROUBLE REPRESENTATIVES ARE NOT COMPENSATED ARE THE ONLY ONES AT THE TABLE WHO ARE NOT BEING PAID FOR OUR KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERIENCE- OUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF. SECRET MITIGATION MEASURES THAT ARE CULTURAL CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE THAT ARE REQUIRED BY THE LAW. THAT THEY PRESENT- THEY HAVE INCLUDED IN THEIR DOCUMENTS- SO WHETHER WE'RE MEDIAN UNDER SB EIGHTEEN AB FIFTY TWO OR EXECUTIVE ORDER BE TEN ELEVEN- THE TRIBES ARE BEING COMPENSATED SO IT'S AT YOUR OWN ECONOMIC LOSS TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION SO A TRIBE. WHO'S ALREADY. NOT IN WHO IS NOT FLUSH WITH MONEY. HAS TO MAKE A DECISION. IF THEY'RE GOING TO PARTICIPATE IN THE PROCESS TO PROTECT SACRED SITES. AND TAKE THAT ECONOMIC LOSS OR THEY'RE NOT GOING TO AND THEN HAVE TO. BEING A DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES IN THE FUTURE. BUT. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW THIS BIT I'M GONNA SING YOU DON'T. BUT MOST BARELY RECOGNIZE TRIBAL MEMBERS ARE NOT ABLE TO BE COMPENSATED BY THEIR TRIED. AND SO THEY REPRESENT THEIR TRIBES UNDER NO FEE ARE VOLUNTARY BASIS- AND SO. THEY HAVE TO HAVE DAY JOBS IN SO. HUH AND WITH THERE ARE NO SPECIFIC GRANTS AVAILABLE FOR- THE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES CAN APPLY FOR A GRANT OR FUNDING FOR TRIBAL HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICERS- THERE'S OTHER GRANTS I'M NOT SAYING THEY'RE NOT COMPETITIVE GRANTS TO GET THAT KIND OF FUNDING- BUT THEY'RE JUST PLAINLY NOT AVAILABLE TO NOT FREELY RECOGNIZE STRIPES. AND SO. THEY HAVE TO SACRIFICE THEIR OWN LIVELIHOODS TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK- AND I KNOW I AM AS A CALIFORNIA CITIZEN AS A CALIFORNIA INDIAN WOMAN I AM GRATEFUL FOR THEIR SACRIFICES- TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THE LEGACY OF THEIR ANCESTORS- ANOTHER CONCERN I KNOW. ANOTHER CONCERN WE HAVE AND I JUST HAVE TO GET THIS LAST ONE OUT AND THAT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE OF- IS UNDER THAT CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN GRAVES AND REPATRIATION ACT. AN UNDER NOW PRO WHICH IS THAT THE FEDERAL VERSION OF IS THE MAIN VERSION AND NON FAIRLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES ARE NOT ABLE TO- REPATRIATE THEIR ANCESTORS. I'M LAST A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES SPONSORS THEM. AND EATING THEN YOU HAVE TO GET THE SECRETARY OF INTERIORS APPROVAL OF FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO REPATRIATE YOUR ANCESTORS UNDER CAL KNACK PRESS. NOT FOR THE RECOGNIZED TRIBES AND FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES ARE LIKE. CALIFORNIA'S STATED THEIR INTENT THEY WANT US TO HAVE OUR ANCESTORS BACK BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE THEY BELONG THEY NEED TO BE REBURIED. UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE WE ARE NOT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED WE HAVE NO LAND BASE. OUR LANDS WERE VALUABLE THAT'S WHY WE'RE NOT. IT IS WE HAD TO BE AND THEY WERE TAKEN SO OUR ANCESTORS CAN'T GO BACK TO MOST LIKELY WHERE THEY CAME FROM BECAUSE NOW IT'S NOT CULTURALLY APPROPRIATE IT'S BEEN DEVELOPED IT'S NOT SAFE. SO WE NEED LAND SO THAT WE CAN RE BURY THE ANCESTORS THAT YOU WANT TO REPATRIATE TO US AND WE WANT YOU TO REPATRIATE TO S. SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT I KNOW THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED AT- WITH AS PRESIDENT JANET NAPOLITANO OVER AT THE UC SYSTEM. BECAUSE IT'S COOL. AGAIN GREAT THAT WE'RE AT A PLACE NOW WHERE THE STATE WANTS TO REPATRIATE OUR ANCESTORS TO US SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A PROPER BURIAL WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT- AND TAKEN OFF THE SHELVES. BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE NEED A PLACE TO PUT THEM AND IT NEEDS TO BE SAFE- AND SO THAT THAT WAS A CONCERN. I NEEDED TO BRING TO YOU AS WELL AS- SAFE ACCESS. TO LANDS FOR HARVESTING AND GATHERING FOR OUR TRADITIONAL PRACTICES OF NATIVE PLANTS- RIGHT NOW THAT IS ONLY. TRULY AVAILABLE TO FINALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES BECAUSE OF THE USE THE FEDERAL PARKS AND TO BE ABLE TO GATHER THE NOT REALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES ARE NOT ALLOWED AND TO DO THAT- AND SO WE ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE NEED TO WORK WITH STATE PARKS- TO DO THAT AND THAT'S- THROUGH MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING AS A PARTNERSHIP. I'M BUT I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE IT ON A NEGATIVE. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA- HAS MADE GREAT STRIDES IN A SALAS RAY BAN EMISSION INDIANS IS VERY GRATEFUL- FOR THOSE STRIDES TO TRY TO. A RIGHT THE WRONGS OF THE PAST BECAUSE TODAY AS A CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBE THAT'S ON THE LIST MAINTAINED BY THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION WE HAVE. CONDUCTED THOUSANDS OF GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT CONSULTATIONS WITH LOCAL AGENCIES TO PROTECT OUR CULTURAL RESOURCES AND SACRED SITES. THANK YOU WE HAVE CONSERVATION EASEMENTS TO PROTECT THOSE SITES BECAUSE OF CALIFORNIA LAW. AND WE ARE ABLE TO- REBURY OUR ANCESTORS WITH DIGNITY RESPECT- THROUGH THE MOST LIKELY TO SENATE STATUTE AS WELL AS CAL MAG PRADA. AND WE'RE ABLE TO ENTER INTO A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT MEMORANDUMS OF UNDERSTANDING WITH FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCIES TO PRACTICE PER CARD- PROTECT OUR SITES. WE CAN DO ALL OF THIS BECAUSE WE'RE CALIFORNIA INDIANS ON THAT LIST. AND THERE'S OTHER TRIBES THAT DO A LAND TRUST NOW SO. I SEE WHERE WE CAN GO TOGETHER I JUST ASK THAT YOU SEE YES AND EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT FAIRLY RECOGNIZED EVEN THOUGH WE'RE NOT- GAMING TRIBES WERE NOT WE DON'T HAVE LOBBYISTS.

WHERE THE ONLY FEDERAL RECOGNIZE TRY RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO COUNTY RIGHT RIGHT HERE ON THIS LAND SO THANK YOU FOR THAT LANDING KNOWLEDGE MEN AS WELL. SONY GIVE ME A BRIEF HISTORY ABOUT AND HO VIEW FEDERAL TERMINATION POLICY ON CALIFORNIA TRIBES. AND THIS IS A OVERVIEW AND TRIBAL PERSPECTIVE OF PERSONAL STRUGGLES ANDKNOWLEDGE IS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE- MY LANDS OF THE HISTORY OF THIS AREA I MAY SOUND LIKE A BROKEN RECORD WITH SOME OF THE PAST TESTIMONY AT YOU YOU'VE JUST HEARD WITH THREE DIFFERENT PRESENTATIONS BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. FOR THE CONTEXT TO EXPLAIN OUR TRIBAL HISTORY AND HOW FEDERAL TERMINATION POLICIES AFFECTED CALIFORNIA TRIBES AND WILL RANCHERIA IN PARTICULAR. JUST A FEW BLOCKS FROM HERE CENTERS FOR IT WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE LATE EIGHTEEN THIRTIES. IT IS LATE MUCH OF THE LOCAL NATIVE POPULATION. TO WORK AT THE FORT IN OTHER PROPERTIES THAT SUTTER OWN IN THE VALLEY. IN EIGHTEEN FORTY EIGHT JUST UP THE AMERICAN RIVER ABOUT SIXTY MILES TO THE EAST OF US. GOLD WAS DISCOVERED AT SUTTER'S MILL. THIS WAS THE BEGINNING OF THE CALIFORNIA GOLD RUSH OF EIGHTEEN FORTY NINE. WE HAVE MANIFESTED AS THE SWEEPING ACROSS THE CONTINENT WE HAVE THE INTERCONTINENTAL RAILROAD CONNECTING THE EAST COAST TO THE WEST COAST. AND IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY WITH THE MASS IMMIGRATION OF PEOPLE NEVER BEFORE SEEN WITH DREAMS OF STRIKING IT RICH XIN CRANING THE FERTILE LANDS FOR THEIR HOMES. CALIFORNIA BECAME THE THIRTY FOR STATE IN THE UNION. IN. THIS MASS IMMIGRATION THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ESPECIALLY RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO AT THE EPICENTER. WAS THE ULTIMATE DEMISE OF ARMY WORK IN MISSION AND PEOPLE OF THIS AREA. ARE FERTILE HUNTING GROUNDS AND GATHERING SPOTS WERE EVER RUN BY THE IMMIGRANTS. ARE TRIBAL ANCESTORS HAD A VACATE THESE AREAS THE CALL HOME AND VACATE TO THE FOOTHILLS OF THE SIERRA S. IN EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE AND FIFTY TWO. EIGHTEEN TREATIES WERE SIGNED BY REPRESENTATIVES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND TRIBAL LEADERS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. RIGHT HERE LOCALLY TREATY J. IN PARTICULAR SIGNED BY OUR ANCESTORS FROM THIS AREA JUST FORTY FIVE MILES TO THE SOUTHEAST ON THE FORKS OF THE CONSUMERS RIVER. THIS TREATY WOULD ESTABLISH TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND SQUARE ACRES OR WELL OVER FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE MILES OF RESERVATION. FOR THE ME WHAT PEOPLE. THESE TREATIES WERE NEVER RATIFIED BY THE UNITED STATES SENATE. THIS IS THE FIRST TERMINATION POLICY OF CALIFORNIA IN MY OPINION. OUR TRIBE'S RIGHT TO CO EXIST WITH THE AND OUR ANCESTRAL LANDS IN IN HARMONY WITH OUR NEW NEIGHBORS THE IMMIGRATION PROBLEM THAT WE'RE HAVING. IN THE EIGHTEEN FIFTIES. FIRST GOVERNOR CALIFORNIA WAS ELECTED GOVERNOR PETER BURNETT. HE CALLED FOR THE EXTERMINATION AND ULTIMATE GENOCIDE OF THE INDIGENOUS POPULATION UP AND DOWN CALIFORNIA FOR BOUNTIES FUNDED BY THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGAIN OUR TRIBAL AFFILIATIONS THE ME WHAT THE NATION ON THE PART WHEN TO. AND THE MIGHTY PEOPLE RIGHT HERE AT THE EPICENTER OF THAT SECOND TERMINATION POLICY. IT SPREAD ACROSS CALIFORNIA DECIMATING ALL TRIBAL GROUPS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. BY THE EARLY NINETEEN HUNDREDS MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION NATIVE AMERICAN INDIGENOUS PEOPLES PARRIS BECAUSE A US TERMINATION POLICIES AND DECISIONS OF THE PAST ALL THAT WIPING OUT OUR HERITAGE AND OUR RACE. SO AT THAT TIME TO DEAL WITH THE LAMMAS INDIAN POPULATION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEGAN CREATING RANCHERIAS. THERE'S FOR VARIOUS GROUPS OF LANDLESS INDIGENOUS POPULATIONS AROUND THIS AREA. WE SURVIVED THE GENOCIDE THE PREVIOUS DECADES OF OPPRESSION. SO IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT A RANCHERIA IT'S A SMALL TRACT OF LAND GIVEN THE SAME STATUS AS A RESERVATION. BUT IT'S ON A MUCH SMALLER SCALE. WILL RANCHERIA IN PARTICULAR WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN TWENTY EIGHT IT WAS THIRTY EIGHT ACRES. AS OPPOSED TO THE FOUR HUNDRED SQUARE MILES THAT TREATY J. OF NINETEEN FIFTY ONE. WOULD HAVE PROVIDED FOR THE TRIBAL PEOPLE. ALL THE TRIBES THAT SURROUND US IN THIS PART OF THIS AREA ARE PART OF THE RANCHERIA ERA. UNITED AUBURN INDIAN COMMUNITY THUNDER VALLEY CASINO SHINGLE SPRINGS BANNING ME WORKING THE ANSWER RED HOT CASINO JACKSON BANTER ME WORKING ITS JACKSON RANCHERIA CASINO I AM THE ENEMY WORKING IAN'S ONE INVEST ABANDON ME LOOKING AS THEY HAVE HARRIS RING CONN- NOT RAIN CONCERT AT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SORRY CHAIRMAN- AND- IT WILL RANCHERIA BY RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO. AND WE'VE GOT ACROSS THE RIVER YESTERDAY HE BàN IN THE WILL- MUCH GUY WHEN TUNING IS EXCUSE ME AND THEY HAVE THE CACHE CREEK CASINO. THERE'S MANY OTHERS SO IN THE LATE NINETEEN FIFTIES UNITED STATES STARTED ANOTHER TERMINATION POLICY IT WAS CALLED THE CALIFORNIA RANCHERIA ACT OF NINETEEN FIFTY EIGHT. THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT EFFECTIVELY TERMINATED FORTY ONE TRIBES INCLUDING RULED RANCHERIA AND BY NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR MORE CALIFORNIA TRIES WERE ADDED TO THE LIST OF TERMINATION. WITH THIS TERMINATION POLICY IN A RANCHERIA ACTORS PROMISES OF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENT OF ROADS WATER SYSTEMS AND OTHER SERVICES. EDUCATIONAL GRANTS AND JOB TRAINING. LANCE TO BE ASSIGNING DEEDED TO INDIVIDUAL FAMILIES LIVING ON THE RANCHERIAS WATER RIGHTS WERE GONNA BE RELINQUISHED AND ALL ACCESS TO FEDERAL INDIAN PROGRAMS WERE TO BE TERMINATED. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NEVER LIVED UP TO THEIR FEDERAL TRUST RESPONSIBILITIES AS PROMISED LEAVING TRIBAL MEMBERS LIVING ON THE RANCHERIAS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES WITHOUT ADEQUATE SERVICES INFRASTRUCTURE. AND OUTSTANDING PROPERTY TAX BILLS FOR DECADES OF THE PAST FROM THEIR RESPECTIVE COUNTIES TO KEEP THEIR LAND ASSIGNMENTS. SO IN EIGHTY THREE THERE IS A HISTORIC LANDMARK CASE CALL THE TELLY HARPER CASE THAT SUED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT FOR NOT FOLLOWING THROUGH WITH ITS TRUST RESPONSIBILITIES AND PROMISES. SEVENTEEN TRIBES RESTORED TO FULL FEDERAL STATUS FROM THAT CASE. WHAT RANCHERIA WENT TO THAT COURT CASE BUT WE COULDN'T THEY WOULD ALLOW US TO ENTER ANY- ANY ACTION ON IT SO THAT BEGAN OUR FIGHT FOR RESTORATION FROM THAT HISTORIC CASE. IT TOOK OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS UNTIL TWO THOUSAND AND NINE FOR WILL RANCHERIA TO BE FULLY RESTORED TO FULL FEDERAL RECOGNITION. WE ARE THE HUNDRED NAY TRIBE IN HUNDRED OUT OF A HUNDRED NINE TRIBES FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT DOES THAT MEAN. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MY LIFETIME. I COULD ACTUALLY CHECK A BOX I HATE SAYING THAT WITHOUT THE QUESTION OF SOME FEDERAL AGENCY THAT I'M NATIVE AMERICAN. I ALWAYS KNEW MY ANCESTRAL HERITAGE WHO I AM WAS NEVER AFFORDED THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES WITHOUT THAT FEDERAL RECOGNITION. ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IN DENTAL SERVICES EDUCATIONAL SCHOLARSHIPS AND GRANT OPPORTUNITIES ONLY FOR FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBAL MEMBERS HOUSING SERVICES AND MANY OTHER BENEFITS. THIS IS WHAT RESTORATION MENTOR TRIBE IN GENERAL. BUT ON A LARGER SCALE WE NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTRACT WITH THE FEDERAL GOVRNMENT AGENCIES LIKE IHS INDIAN HEALTH SERVICES FOR PROGRAMS AND MEDICAL NEEDS FOR TRIBAL MEMBERS CONTACT WITH HUD HOUSING URBAN DEVELOPMENT FOR HOUSING HOMELESS ISSUES CONTRACT WITH EPA- ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY FOR BILLIARD ABILITY TO PROTECT TO MONITOR PRECIOUS RESOURCES AND OUR TRIBAL LANDS. IRVINE IN AFFAIRS WE CONTRACT WITH TO PROVIDE GOVERNMENTAL SUPPORT TO WRITE EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES INDIAN CHILD WELFARE PROTECTIONS ELDER SERVICES AND SUPPORT SOCIAL SERVICES FOR. YOU SERVICES AND SUPPORT TRIBAL COURT FUNDING TO PROVIDE OVER MATTERS THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT OUR TRIBE OR TRIBAL MEMBERS. AND OVERALL SUPPORT TO GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURE. BEING FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED ALLOWS US THE ABILITY TO RAISE REVENUE TO LEVY TAXES ON FEDERAL TRUST LAND. THE ABILITY THE NOTION NEGOTIATE WITH ANY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES SUCH AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS AN EQUAL SOVEREIGN NATION. THE RIGHT TO GOVERN OURSELVES. SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY AND SELF SUFFICIENCY. SO ON ONE FOOT NOW WHEN THE TRIBE WAS RESTORED IN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE WE WERE LANDLESS WE HAD TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS CALLED LAND INTO TRUST THAT'S A NEED FOR PROCESS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR TO REGAIN HISTORICAL ANCESTRAL TERRITORY FOR THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT OR HOUSING OR TO CREATE A TRIBAL HOME BASE. WE WERE FINALLY SUCCESSFUL IN A DECISION ON THE LAST DAY OF THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION IN JANUARY OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. WE FINALLY PUT THIRTY SIX ACRES OF LAND IN A TRUST FOR THE TRIBES. NEARLY SIXTY YEARS AFTER BEING TERMINATED AND LANDLESS. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THAT. THE GENERATIONAL PROBLEMS OF THAT SYSTEMIC FROM THOSE TERMINATION POLICIES THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT'S ON CALIFORNIA TRIBES ON OUR NATIVE PEOPLE. OUT OF ALL THE ETHNIC GROUPS NATIVE AMERICANS HAD THE WORST STATISTICS AND MANY NEGATIVE CATEGORIES SOMETIMES WERE NOT EVEN COUNTED AT ALL AND- THERE'S A LACK OF TRUST OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. LACK OF TRUST AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OUR CULTURE OUR WAYS ARE LANGUAGE WAS ALL BUT STRIPPED AWAY OUR IDENTITY OF WHO WE ARE. WE'RE ALL BUT DESTROYED. OUR ANCESTRAL LANDS ALL BUT STONE AWAY WITH SO MANY BROKEN PROMISES OF TERMINATION. SO IN CONCLUSION WHEN YOU SEE LEGISLATION COME ACROSS YOUR DESK OR YOU ASKED TO VOTE ON LEGISLATION OR INITIATIVES THAT INVOLVES TRIES ON GAMING ON EDUCATION ON ANY CHILD WELFARE ON HOUSING AND ANY ANOTHER OF DIFFERENT ISSUES THAT FACE OUR TRIBES. I WANT YOU TO REMEMBER THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND HOW WE GOT HERE. I WANT YOU TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY. TO RECOGNIZE OUR LOSS OF ANCESTRAL HOMELANDS. AND BEAT SUPPORT OF OUR QUEST TO RESTORE THOSE TRIBAL LANDS ONE ACRE AT A TIME. AND I WANT YOU TO NOT FEEL SORRY ABOUT THE PAST BUT HOW YOU AS LEADERS OF THIS GREAT STATE TO WORK SIDE BY SIDE WITH TRIBES TO REALIZE A BETTER TOMORROW. TO UNDERSTAND THE REAL HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA TRIBES AND WHAT TERMINATION POLICIES DID TO US AS A RACE AS TRIBAL NATIONS AND WORK TOGETHER TO CHANGE THESE HORRIBLE POLICIES INTO HOPE IN SHADES FOR GENERATIONS TO COME. TING INCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT- PRESENTATION. AND THE DISCUSSIONS THAT WE'VE HAD- UP TO THIS POINT. WITH THE DIFFERENT PRESENTERS- A CATCHER REASONING VOLLEY- DOCTOR STANLEY RODRIGUEZ- MERRY LOPEZ KEY FOR AND CHAIRMAN HITCHCOCK BRING INTO THE PERSPECTIVE OF. THE HISTORY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA PEOPLE AS A WHOLE AND- REALLY. TRYING TO EDUCATE THE STATE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THAT WHEN. THERE'S AN INADVERTENT DISCOVERY OF NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS REMAINS THAT ARE CLOSE TO A FAIT RECOGNIZED TRIBE MOST LIKELY DESCENDANTS ARE NOTIFIED. BUT ALSO WHEN REMAINS ARE FOUND IN POPULATED CITIES SUCH AS LOS ANGELES OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THERE IS NO FERRY RECOGNIZED TRIBES DOESN'T MEAN. THAT THERE ISN'T TRIBES THAT ARE THEY'RE WILLING TO- REBURY RESPECTFULLY THEIR ANCESTORS SO AN ANCESTORS OF CALIFORNIA PEOPLE AREN'T COVERED THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THIS DISCUSSION THAT WE'RE HAVING TALKS ABOUT IN TRYING TO BRING THAT KNOWLEDGE THAT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE INADVERTENT DISCOVERY OF NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS. THAT IT INCLUDES ALL CALIFORNIA PEOPLE FROM THE FEDERAL RECOGNITION TO THE NON RECOGNITION TO THE TERMINATION ACT THAT NOW HAS A FEDERAL COMMISSION MOVING FORWARD. BUT YET WE KNOW AS IT WAS ALLOCATE ME PUT THAT FEDERAL RECOGNIZE RESERVATIONS AREN'T IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AREN'T ON THE COAST RIGHT ART IN AREAS THAT ARE BEING DEVELOPED. SO THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION IS REALLY CENTER AROUND. THAT DISCUSSION OF THE INVERTED DISCOVERY AND HONORING OUR ANCESTORS OUR ANCESTORS OF MAKING SURE THAT THEIR VOICES PUT A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD OF OTHER ARCHAEOLOGISTS DIRECTORS OF ORGANIZATIONS SO THAT WHEN THAT COMES TOGETHER AND WE SAT THROUGH A LOT OF COMMISSION HEARINGS TOGETHER. WE SEEN THAT. LEVERAGE I BELIEVE THESE TYPES OF HEARINGS THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS IS PUTTING US BACK TO WHERE WE NEED TO BE. IN THE NEXT SPEAKER- THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE COME UP WILL PUT ALL THAT TOGETHER- INTO SOMETHING THAT WE CAN- DEFINITELY- MOVE FORWARD ON. AND THAT'S LARA MARANDA WHO'S THE CHAIR OF THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION SO LET'S CLEAR THE WAY AND LET LAURA COME UP. IN THANK YOU LARA FOR. AGREED TO COME IN LARA IS GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT DEFINING CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES FOR INCLUSIVITY. AND. LARA AROUND AS A MEMBER OF THE CHINA BAND IN THE SANYO INDIANS IN NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION CHAIR. SHE WILL HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW TO BE INCLUSIVE AS WE WORK TO DEFINE THE CUT WHAT CONSTITUTES A CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBE THANK YOU. SURE WOMEN MARANDA FROM THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERE HEY GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU FOR THAT INTERACTION- ASSEMBLY MEN CHAIRMAN ALL OF YOUR TITLES- I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR. THE FORMATION OF THIS SELECT COMMITTEE- JUST THINK IT'S SO IMPORTANT- I'VE BEEN% WORKING IN THE AREA OF. LEGISLATIVE WORK ON CULTURAL RESEARCHERS PROTECTION SACRED SITES PROTECTION- HUMAN REMAINS FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS- I'M A LAWYER A TRIBAL LAWYER WORK FOR MY TRIBE BUT I'VE ALSO WORKED FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER TRIBES. AND HAVE BEEN FORTUNATE TO BE A TECHNICAL CONSULTANT TO- MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE ON A NUMBER OF BILLS CONCERNING SACRED SITES- THAT MOST LIKELY DESCENDANTS STATUTE OF- WHEN HUMAN REMAINS ARE FOUND. AND THE KNACK FOR STATUTES THAT ARE THE CALIFORNIA BASED- REPATRIATION STATUTES I WAS ALSO ASSEMBLYMAN GATOS TECHNICAL ADVISER ON AB FIFTY TWO WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH THE MOST RECENT. PIECE OF LEGISLATION- VERY- PRO PROTECTION OF TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN STATE LAW OF TRIBES AS GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES THAT ARE ENTITLED TO CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON ISSUES THAT AFFECT THEIR CULTURAL RESOURCES- WE ALSO GOT. TRIBAL CULTURE RESOURCES IN THE SEA QUEST THE STATE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY ACT AS A NEW CATEGORY OF RESOURCES THAT DESERVE PROTECTIONS JUST LIKE BIOLOGICAL RESOURCES WETLANDS AND OTHER RESOURCES THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT CALIFORNIA. SO THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF MY HISTORY- AND KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE THAT I BRING. TODAY I'M I'M WEARING THE HAT. AS NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION CHAIR. AND JUST SORT OF WANTED TO TALK ABOUT- SOME OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE PRESENTLY DEALING WITH AND THAT ARE SORT OF FEELING LIKE THEY'RE ON THE HORIZON FOR THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE AND- ASSEMBLYMAN RAMOS HAS BEEN A BIG SUPPORTER OF WARNING TO ASSIST WITH THAT. THE COMMISSION. THE. THE COMMISSION JUST LAKE WE'RE ENVISIONING THIS COMMITTEE CAN BE A GREAT RESOURCE TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE MEMBERS ON ISSUES OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN CULTURE SO THE HERITAGE COMMISSION HAS- BEEN EXISTENCE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS- ALMOST FORTY YEARS WE CELEBRATED OUR- THE FORTIETH I THINK WAS OUR FORTIETH ANNIVERSARY ORDER A COUPLE YEARS AGO YEAH. TONY JUST MORE THAN THAT. YEAH I AM BUT BUT THIS IS A REAL IT FORTY YEARS IS A LONG TIME BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT IN THE CONTEXT OF OVERALL HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT THAT LONG- AND THAT WAS THE TIME WHEN THE AND I'M SURE YOU I THINK AT THIS COMMITTEE RECEIVED A BRIEFING ON SORT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COMMISSION. MAYBE AT THE LAST HEARING- BUT BUT FOR PURPOSES OF JUST CONTEXT HERE AND TIMING IT WAS ONLY THE FORTY YEARS AGO THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA STARTED RECOGNIZING THROUGH STATE LAW THAT NATIVE AMERICAN REMAINS DESERVED PROTECTIONS SO WE'RE TALKING VERY RECENT RECENT HISTORY AND THROUGH THAT THAT PIECE. OF US HAVING IS THAT- VAST AMOUNT OF KNOWLEDGE OF THE LAST FORTY YEARS OF ASSISTING TRIBES WITH THESE ISSUES. THE COMMISSION ALSO STANDS AS A RESOURCE TO ALL OF YOU- ON ON ISSUES OF SACRED SITES PROTECTION AND CULTURAL ISSUES FOR TRIBES AND I JUST WANTED OFFER THAT AS WELL BECAUSE PART OF OUR COMMISSION DUTIES IS ACTUALLY TO PROVIDE- RECOMMENDATIONS THE LEGISLATURE ON CERTAIN ISSUES SURROUNDING CERTAIN SUBJECTS THE SURROUNDING SACRED PLACES. AND REPATRIATION. I WANTED TO TALK ABOUT IT A SORT OF CURRENT ISSUE AND IT THEY'RE BOTH RELATED A ONE OF THEM IS- WET AND ASSEMBLYMAN RAMOS HAD- IDENTIFIED IS THE DEFINITION OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES. AND FOR THE CONTEXT HERE FOR PURPOSES OF AND WE HAD THIS THIS ARC OF HISTORY OF THE UNIQUE STATUS AND HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA. AND HOW TRIBES HAVE BEEN REMOVED FROM THEIR LANDS AND HOW THEY'VE BEEN FORCEFULLY EVICTED AND REMOVED AND THEIR TIES TO THEIR CULTURE HAD BEEN FORCIBLY REMOVED ALTHOUGH I FEEL LIKE THE TRIBES HAVE DONE. THE TREMENDOUS AND IT'S A TESTAMENT TO US WERE ALL SURVIVORS OF CULTURAL TRAUMA THAT WE'VE CAPPED OUR TRADITIONS AND CULTURES ALIVE- BUT IT'S BEEN AT- AT THE FIGHTING OF ICE BEING CUT OFF FROM THEM. SO THAT IN THAT CONTEXT THAT WE'VE HAD I WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE SORT OF MODERN DAY. PROBLEMS OR CHALLENGES THAT TRIBES ARE FACING BECAUSE OF THE UNIQUE HISTORY AND- ONE OF THOSE THINGS IS BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE STATUS AND THE STANDING AND STATE LAWS TO THEN GO ON AND PROTECT YOUR CULTURE RESEARCHERS YOUR SACRED SITES IN YOUR HUMAN REMAINS. ANDMARY HAD TOUCHED BRIEFLY ON SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT A NON RECOGNIZED TRIBE MIGHT HAVE AND- RECOGNIZED TRIBES HAVE SIMILAR ISSUES- SO IN TALKING ABOUT. THESE THINGS IT'S THE DEFINITION OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES AND THEN ALSO IN CONTEXT OF REPATRIATION AND IN PARTICULAR THE CALIFORNIA KNACK PER BILL ARE ARE THE CALIFORNIA NOW PRO LAW AND AS IT RELATES TO REPATRIATION OF HUMAN REMAINS- THAT THE REPATRIATION OF HUMAN REMAINS A PROTECTION OF HUMAN REMAINS. IS A PRETTY CURRENT ISSUE RIGHT NOW IN THE RECENT YEARS THERE'S BEEN- A NUMBER OF CONCERNS BY TRIBES OF THEIR ABILITY TO USE THE FEDERAL LAW- AND THE STATE LAW TO. IT TO ENABLE RICK THESE INSTITUTIONS AND MUSEUMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- NAMELY HE UC SYSTEM TO REPATRIATE REMAINS THAT ARE BEING HOUSE THERE. MY COMMISSION MY COMMISSION HAS A VERY UNIQUE ROLE WITH REGARD TO- THE STATE REPATRIATION AND THE FEDERAL PATRIATION LAW WE ARE ACTUALLY- LOOKED AT AS- THE OVERSIGHT GROUP- THAT WE HAVE THE BOB THE OBLIGATION AND THE ROLES TO ASSIST IN IMPLEMENTATION OF REPATRIATION WE ACTUALLY CAN ORDER REPATRIATION OF HUMAN REMAINS AND CULTURAL ITEMS BY STATE THAT ARE HOLDING THEM. AND WE ALSO CAN HELP IMPLEMENT THE FEDERAL LAW WE CAN ACTUALLY REPORT IF WE THINK THAT STATE- INSTITUTIONS AND MUSEUMS ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE FEDERAL AND STATE LAW WE CAN REPORT TO THE FEDERAL OVERSIGHT COMMISSION AND THEN WE CAN BRING PEDAL TO THE PENALTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR NON COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. THE REASON THIS IS THE- AND THIS IS FOR PURPOSES OF OUR OTHER WE HAVE TO A COUPLE OF OTHER KEY ROLES ONE OF THEM AS WE CAN HELP MEDIATE DISPUTES IF THAT IF THE TRIBES THAT ARE TRYING TO CLAIM REPATRIATION OF THEIR ANCESTORS OR THEIR TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES ARE HAVING ISSUES. WITH THE MUSEUMS ARE INSTITUTIONS WE CAN STEP IN AND MEDIATE DISPUTES WE CAN ASSIST WITH- OF IDENTIFICATION OF TRIBES AND GROUPS TO TALK TO WITH THE MUSEUMS AND INSTITUTIONS SO WE PLAY A KEY ROLE IN FACILITATING THIS. AND I DID THIS TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT SO CALIFORNIA NOW PRESS. I DON'T KNOW IF THE I MEAN I THINK YOU ALL ARE FAMILIAR WITH THAT IT WAS IMPLEMENTED IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE. AND THEN ASSEMBLYMAN STEINBERG AUTHORED THIS BILL AND IT WAS MAINLY TO DEAL WITH THE UNIQUE. CIRCUMSTANCES OF CALIFORNIA INDIANS IN THAT THEY WEREN'T ABLE TO USE THE FEDERAL LAW. TO REPATRIATE THEIR HUMAN REMAINS FROM THESE INSTITUTIONS. AT THAT TIME THE UC WAS ONE OF THE- I GUESS VOLATORS AND UNFORTUNATELY UC BERKELEY STILL HOLDS AS OF A TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT NINE THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED SETS OF HUMAN REMAINS. OF THOSE THEY ARE SAYING THAT 86% OF THOSE THEY DON'T KNOW THE CULTURAL AFFILIATION AND FOR PURPOSES OF THE LAW THAT MEANS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TO REPEAT TREAT THEM BECAUSE THEY CLAIM THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE DESCENDED FROM. THEY ALSO HAVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND THIS WAS IN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN REPORT ON- UC CAMPUS CAP IT KNACK PER ACTIVITIES THAT THEY ALSO HAVE THIRTEEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE- ASSOCIATED FUNERARY OBJECTS AND THOSE- THAT'S THE TECHNICAL LEGAL TERM BUT- FROM A TRIBAL PERSPECTIVE WE THINK OF THOSE IS BURIAL GOODS AND GRADE GOODS IN SACRED ITEMS- THEY HAVE OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND OF THOSE ITEMS. OF WHICH 72% THEY SAY ARE CULTURALLY UNAFFILIATED MEANING THEY DON'T KNOW WHO TO REPEAT THEIR REPATRIATE THEM TO OR THEY SAY THAT THERE ISN'T AN EXISTING PRESENT DAY GROUP. THAT CAN SHOW THAT THERE CULTURALLY AFFILIATED WITH THOSE ITEMS THIS IS A HUGE PROBLEM- BERKELEY HAS AT THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM HAS ONE OF THE LARGEST NAGS PRO IMPLEMENTED COLLECTIONS IN THE NATION. AND THIS IS ON A SCALE AND THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM HAS ADMITTED THAT THEY'VE SAID WE DON'T WE WE'RE NOT A CAN TO OTHER EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA. OUR COLLECTIONS ARE ON A SCALE THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO THE AMERICAN MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY OR THE SMITHSONIAN WE'RE TALKING A LARGE COLLECTION HERE THAT HAS A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE OF HOW IT'S GOING TO BE TREATED HOW WE CAN A TACKLE THIS ISSUE. BECAUSE PRESENTLY THERE ARE NUMBER OF TRIBES THAT ARE TRYING TO INVOKE THE STATE CAL KNACK PRATT TO GET THESE THINGS FOR PATRIOT IT BECAUSE THE STATE CAL NOW PER ADDS SOME EXTRA ELEMENTS OF THE FEDERAL LAW DOESN'T ADD THAT RECOGNIZES THIS WHOLE ARC OF UNIQUE. TERMINATION AND GENOCIDE HISTORY THAT YOU'VE HEARD OF THERE'S- THERE'S AN AND A PIECE ABOUT STATE LANDS AFFILIATION AND THAT REALLY GIVES THE ABILITY FOR THESE INSTITUTIONS TEND NOT HAVE A STRICT CHRONOLOGICAL AND CONNECTION BUT TO HAVE AN OVER ALL- UNDERSTANDING BASED ON TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE IN HISTORY- OF THEIR TIED TO THESE ITEMS. MAKING IT EASIER FOR THEM TO SHOW THEIR CULTURAL FILIATION AND FOR THEM TO THEN RETURN HOME AND GET REPATRIATED- AND THE ISSUE IN TWO THOUSAND AND ONE AND UP UNTIL NOW REALLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA NOW PER IS THAT ALTHOUGH IT HAD SOME GREAT LANGUAGE AND IT WAS NEVER FUNDED. AND IT NEVER REALLY GOT IMPLEMENTED- AND THE COMMISSION- WE GET WE ARE RECEIVING- REQUEST PRESENTLY TO START IMPLEMENTING THAT LAW AND THE COMMISSION WE HAVE OVERSIGHT TO GET THAT GOING- THE PRESENT DAY ISSUE IS THERE ARE THERE SOME THINGS SENSE THE LAW IS. A LITTLE DATED AND THE FEDERAL LAW HAS BEEN UPDATED SENSE THEN THAT THERE ARE SOME LANGUAGE THINGS THAT. IT NEED TO BE BROUGHT UP TO DATE- AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT AT THIS POINT AND ONE OF THEM IS THE DEFINITION O CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES. THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT- WHAT IS PRESENTLY BEING PROPOSED IS THIS INCLUSIVE DEFINITION OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES. AND I JUST WANTED TO GIVE SOME BACKGROUND ON THAT TO SET SOME CONTACTS FOR HOPEFULLY SOME SOME- CHANGES AND LEGISLATIVE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO BE COMING- SOON ABOUT THAT. NOW WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN I'M TALKING ABOUT IN THIS CONTEXT CALVET DEFINITION CALIFORNIAN IN TRIBES I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT FEDERAL RECOGNITION OR STATE RECOGNITION OR- ANY ENTITY ANY STATE ENTITY BEING THE LEGISLATURE OR THE HERITAGE COMMISSION OR ANY STATE AGENCY DESIGNATING WHO IS INDIAN AND WHO IS NOT INDIAN OR WHO IS A TRIBE AND WHO IS NOT A TRIBE- I AM BECAUSE THAT IS A FEDERAL RECOGNITION PROCESS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T HAVE A ROLE IN. SOWHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT IS DEFINING WHO IS A CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBE FOR PURPOSES THAT BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE LAWS THAT GIVE TRIBES IN NEED OF PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO PROTECT THEIR RESOURCES REPATRIATE THEIR RESOURCES PROTECT THEIR SACRED SITES SO THIS IS ALL ABOUT THAT AND CURRENTLY THE HERITAGE COMMISSION HAS A CONTACT LIST- THAT. THAT WE DEFINE AS CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES AND THAT CONTACTLESS HAS BASICALLY BEEN ENOUGH FACTS. SENSE. TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR. WITH THE PASSAGE OF A OF A LAW CALLED SB EIGHTEEN WHICH WERE AMENDMENTS INTO THE PLANNING LAW THAT ALLOWED TRIBES TO CONSULT WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ABOUT PROTECTION A PLATE SIT THEIR SACRED SITES WINS CITIES AND COUNTIES UP DID THEIR GENERAL PLAN UPDATED THEIR GENERAL PLANTS. THEN THEY WOULD CONSULT WITH TRIBES TRIED TO TELL THEM WHERE SENSITIVE AREAS WERE AND HOW THEY COULD DO PROACTIVE PLANNING TO AVOID- PROTECT THESE SITES. AND AT THAT TIME THE BILL THE LEGISLATURE PUT INTO PLACE A PROCESS- TO DEFINE OKAY WHO WERE THE ELIGIBLE TRIBES THAT ARE GONNA BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CONSULTATION WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO PROTECT THEIR SACRED PLACES. WE KNOW THE UNIQUE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA IT CAN'T JUST BE RACKING FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBES- AND I WAS ONE OF THE TECHNICAL PEOPLE- ALONG WITH IT IT AT MANY OTHERS THAT PUSHED FOR AN OVER INCLUSIVE DEFINITION. TO RECOGNIZE THE UNIQUE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIA AND SO WHAT THE PROCESS THAT ENDED UP BEING CODIFIED WAS THAT THE NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION AS AN EXPERT. IN CULTURAL RESOURCES TRIBAL RESOURCES- SENSE THE EARLY EIGHTIES WOULD BE THE STATE AGENCY THAT WOULD THEN TAKE ON THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CREATING THIS CONTACTLESS FOR CONSULTATION PURPOSES AND WE DID THAT. AND THAT THEN GOT CARRIED INTO- AB FIFTY TWO WHICH IS THE THAT LOG THE AMENDMENTS AND TO SEEK WHAT. AND SO WE ALSO DESIGNATE- WE USE THAT SAME CONTACT LIST THAT WE DESIGNATE TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS WHICH TRIBES THEY ARE TO CONSOLE WITH ON PROTECTION OF TRIBAL CULTURAL RESOURCES WHEN THEY'RE IMPACTED BY. ANY DEVELOPMENT THAT SUBJECT TO SEA QUEST. SO THE COMMISSION. AND IN EVEN BEFORE. TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THE COMMISSION HAS BEEN IDENTIFYING WHAT'S CALLED MOST LIKELY DESCENDANTS UNDER THE NADIR UNDER THAT NATIVE AMERICAN HUMAN REMAINS LAW- SO. THE COMMISSION HAS THE FORTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN IDENTIFYING WHOSE CULTURALLY AFFILIATED. AND TERMS OF WHO'S ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CARING AND THAT INTO THE REPATRIATION STATUTES. AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE- IT JUST AS BACKGROUND- BUT WHEN WE WENT THROUGH THE DISCUSSIONS OF HOW DO YOU DEFINE TRIBES FOR PURPOSES OF THE STATE LAWS. THERE WAS TALK IN THE BEGINNING ABOUT ACTUALLY TRYING TO WRITE A DEFINITION OF CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES AND THE LEGISLATURE CREATING THAT DEFINITION BACK IN THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND IT WAS QUICKLY REALIZED THAT- DID THE TRIBES DIDN'T WANT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SAYING WHO WAS A TRIBE AND WHO WASN'T. AND THE STATE OF THE LEGISLATURE DID NOT REALLY WANT THAT TASK EITHER IT'S NOT IT'S NOT UP TO THEM IT'S AT ITS OUT OF THAT PER VIEW SENTENCE OF FEDERAL FEDERAL ISSUE BUT HOW THE COMMISSION DOES IT IS THAT WE IT'S BASICALLY THE TRIBES SELF IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE AND WHERE THEIR TERRITORIES ARE. AND WE DO THAT BASED ON TWO MAIN CRITERIA ONE IS THAT I AM SHOWING THAT THEY ARE DESCENDED FROM A HISTORICAL CALIFORNIA TRIBE AND THE OTHER IS THAT THEY HOLD THEMSELVES OUT AS A TRIBAL GOVERNMENT AND THEY OPERATE THAT WAY. AND IF THEY CAN SHOW THOSE THINGS AND SHOW AND IT'S SUBMIT THOSE DOCUMENTS- THE COMMISSION PUTS THEM ON THE LIST OF WHO IS A CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBE FOR PURPOSES OF YOU KNOW CONSULTATION ON THESE CULTURAL RESOURCES ISSUES AND WE'VE NOT HAD ANY COMPLAINTS THAT THAT PROCESS ISN'T WORKING. M. IT'S YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE EVERY DAY SORT OF YOU KNOW ISSUES OF THAT OF ADMINISTRATING THIS AND WE'VE BEEN UNDER FUNDED FOR SO LONG BUT THE OVERALL FEEDBACK THAT THE COMMISSION HAS RECEIVED IS THAT THIS PROCESS IS WORKING FOR THE CONSULTATION PLEASE SO WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE WANTING TO CARRY THAT THROUGH TO THE REPATRIATION PIECE- BECAUSE RIGHT NOW. THE REPATRIATION LAW IT IS JUST A WOEFULLY OUT OF DATE AND THERE IS AN EXISTING DEFINITION UNFORTUNATELY AND THE LAW AS IT EXISTS THAT IS JUST. IT'S NOT EVEN COMPLAIN WITH FEDERAL LAW AT THIS POINT IT'S JUST AN OLD DEFINITION SO WE'RE LOOKING TO BRING THAT UP TO DATE- IT'S A WAY THAT. WE CAN HELP GET THE ANCESTORS HOME QUICKER- BY OVER IT BY BEING INCLUSIVE IN OUR DEFINITIONS OF WHO WE CONSIDER OUR CALIFORNIA INDIAN TRIBES FOR PURPOSES OF STATE LAW. WE WANT TO. AND IN DO THAT IN A WAY THAT GETS THESE ANCESTORS HOME- SO I'D- MOVE. THE REASON FOR GIVING YOU KNOW ALL THAT BACKGROUND. IS TO IS TO SET UP THIS PIECE OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT- WE MOVE FORWARD WITH AN INCLUSIVE DEFINITION WITH- THE COMMISSION AS THEENTITY THAT HAS THE EXPERTISE TO WORK WITH TRIBES TO FACILITATE THESE TYPES OF DISCUSSIONS AND TO ENABLE- CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO GET THE ANCESTORS BACK HOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU. SHOWN AROUND UP IN YOU YOU TOUCHED ON THE ISSUES AND CERTAINLY WE'VE BEEN WORKING TOGETHER A NATIVE AMERICAN HERITAGE COMMISSION FOR SOME TIME I'M NOT SURE FORTY YEARS BUT WE'VE BEEN THERE TOGETHER WORKING ON THE ISSUES THAT ARE THERE AND A LOT OF TIMES- WE SEE TESTIMONY COME BEFORE THE COMMISSION WHAT ARE TRAVEL- MEMBERS CALIFORNIA TRAVEL MEMBERS. WILL SAY THAT. CERTAIN THINGS ARE ARE ASSOCIATED WITH WITH THE BURIAL RIGHT WITH REMAINS THAT ARE THERE. AND REQUEST ALL THAT TO BE- COMING BACK TO THE TO THE TRAVEL- CALIFORNIA PEOPLE BUT THEN DISAGREEMENT HAPPENS BETWEEN. DEPARTMENT HEADS ARCHAEOLOGIST- UC'S OF WHAT THEY CONSTITUTE TO BE. NATIVE AMERICAN- REMAINS AND THE ASSOCIATED- GRAVES THAT GO WITH IT AND WHEN THAT DISCUSSION HAPPENS. USUALLY IT'S THE SIDE OF THE UC'S IN THOSE THE END UP PREVAILING OVER THE DISCUSSION WITH A TRAVEL- MEMBERS THAT ARE THERE. SO. AS THIS LEGISLATURE CONTINUES TO DIVE IN TO ADDRESSING ISSUES AND DEFINITIONS OF GIVING THE CALIFORNIA INDIAN PEOPLE THE WHERE WITH ALL TO BE ABLE TO COME IN EQUALLY OR GREATER. THAN THESE DEPARTMENT HEADS OR EVEN THE UC'S RIGHT WHEN IT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REPATRIATION ITEMS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THOSE ISSUES- YOU BROUGHT UP AN INCLUSIVE DESK DEFINITION. WHICH COMES BACK TO THE WHOLE PRESENTATION FROM- FROM MISTER STANLEY RODRIGUEZ TO A MERRY LOPEZ KEEPER AND CHAIRMAN HITCHCOCK INTO YOURSELF. OF THE OVERVIEW OF THE CALIFORNIA PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE'RE% FOCUSING STRICTLY ON. CULTURAL RESOURCES CULTURAL PRESERVATION AND IN INVERNESS COVERAGE OF HUMAN REMAINS THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. SO WE DO LOOK AT AND WE WILL WORK TOGETHER AND LOOK AT THE HERITAGE COMMISSION AS BEING ABLE TO. LOOK AT THE INCLUSIVENESS OF THOSE DEFINITIONS BUT IT'S BECAUSE- OF THE INADVERTENT DISCOVERY. THAT'S BEING DONE THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND GIVING THE WAY BACK TO THE ORIGINAL PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ALL CALIFORNIA PEOPLE WHEN IT COMES TO THE THAT THOSE DISCUSSIONS OF WHAT CONSTITUTES- REMAINS WHAT CONSTITUTES ASSOCIATE BURIAL GOODS WITH THEM AND WHEN THE TRIBAL PEOPLE ELDERS ARE SAYING ALL THIS. IS ASSOCIATED WITH IT THEN I THINK THE WEIGHT OF THAT SHOULD BE WITH THE TRIBAL ELDERS. DEFINITELY AND I THINK. THE ONE OF THE LORD ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT YOU POINTED OUT WHEN TRIBES- ARE TO- CONSOLE WITH THESE INSTITUTIONS ESPECIALLY THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY THE ARCHAEOLOGISTS OPINIONS ARE GIVEN GREATER WEIGHT THAN THE TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE AND THE TRIBAL HISTORY AND SO. IT IT RELATED TO HAVING AN INCLUSIVE DEFINITION AND THE AND THE PEOPLE AT THE TABLE THAT NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE IS ALSO THE RESPECT- AND THE INCLUSION AND HOPEFULLY LEGISLATIVELY MANDATED INCLUSION OF TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE- INTO THOSE DECISIONS BECAUSE- THEY TRY TO REMOVE FROM THE LANDS AND NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN AND LOS TIES AND LOST SOME OF THAT INFORMATION. BUT THEY DO HAVE INFORMATION THEY DO HAVE PLACE NAME INFORMATION THEY DO HAVE VALID- HISTORIES SONGS LANGUAGE ORAL HISTORIES- MY TRIBE WAS RECENTLY- DENIED A CLAIM AT TO REPEAT TREAT FROM THE PHOEBE HEARST MUSEUM AND WE WERE TOLD THAT OUR ORAL HISTORY WAS NICE POETRY. BUT THAT IT WASN'T ENOUGH PROOF TO ESTABLISH CULTURAL AFFILIATION. AND SO THIS JUST YOU KNOW HAPPEN AT ABOUT A YEAR AGO SO WE'RE TALKING PRESENT DAY. SITUATIONS AND WHERE A FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED TRIBE. LOT OF RESOURCES LAWYERS- A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT CAN HELP TO NAVIGATE THE SYSTEM'S BUT UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ARE FEVER RANG- AT THEIR SCIENTIFIC OPINIONS OVER THE TRIBAL KNOWLEDGE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO BRING A GEATER BALANCE AT BACK INTO THOSE SITUATIONS. AND GET THE ANCESTORS HOME- ANOTHER PIECE THAT YOU BROUGHT UP ABOUT THE- ABOUT THE- CLAIMS OF THE OF THE- MOST LIKELY DESCENDANTS- IS A CURRENT PROJECT THAT I DON'T I MEAN I KNOW YOUR ON THE COMMITTEE FOR THE CAPITAL ANNEX PROJECT.

WE KNOW THIS WAS BUILT ON A FLOOD PLAIN OF SORTS AND THERE'S PROBABLY GOING TO BE INADVERTENT DISCOVERIES IN A LOT OF ISSUES GOING ON HERE SO THAT'S A THAT'S ANOTHER PIECE WHERE YOU KNOW WE CAN BE WE CAN BE LEADERS IN THAT ROLE OF SETTING UP. A KEY- KEY PROCESSES THAT CAN BE USED AS MODELS- FOR HOW YOU CONSULT WITH TRIBES AND INCLUDE THEM IN- IN ACTIVITIES THAT ARE AFFECTING THEIR CULTURAL RESOURCES. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION ALL THE PRISONERS FOR- EDUCATING THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ON THE HISTORY OF CALIFORNIAN PEOPLE AS A WHOLE. IS OR ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I HAVE A SO MAYBE A COMMON AND A QUESTION. I WAS AT THE UC REGENTS MEETING WHEN I THINK IT WAS YOUR CHAIR OF THE CHINA WHO WHO A PRESENTED ON ON THE PHOEBE- HERS MUSEUM AND I KNOW THAT CHAIR- JOHN PET IS WORKING CLOSELY CHAIR JOHN BETTIS OF THE UC REGENTS IS WORKING CLOSELY WITH HIM. TO TRY TO DO BETTER. YES IN THAT ASPECT AND I DID HAVE ONE QUESTION- IF I MAY TO MARY I'M NOT SURE IF SHE IF I COULD HOW HOW DOES A OF TRIED. WHO LOSES ITS LAND. AND NOT AND NOT FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED AS YOUR YOUR EXAMPLE HOW HOW ARE THEY ABLE TO STAY- YOU KNOW MAINTAIN. AT TOGETHER AND MAINTAIN CULTURE LANGUAGE HOW HOW DO THEY DO THAT. FIRST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ASKING- BECAUSE TO PERSEVERE THROUGH EVERYTHING THEY'VE GOT WE'VE GONE THROUGH. IT. IT BLOWS MY MIND- TO BORROW A PHRASE FROM THE YEAR I WAS BORN. WHAT. WHAT MY GREAT GRANDFATHER DID NOT LACK WAS THE. HE DID NOT SUFFER FROM A POVERTY OF THE IMAGINATION. HE WAS ONE WHO. WHO FIRMLY BELIEVED THAT WE WERE ALLOWED. OUR LAND BACK AND HE INSTILLED IN MY ELDERS THE FACT THAT WE ARE A PEOPLE WE ARE A TRIBE AND WE MUST TAKE CARE OF ONE ANOTHER AND SO WHEN HE PASSED ON A WENT TO MY GREAT AUNT AND MY FROM MY GREAT AUNT IT WENT TO MY AUNT AND- A COUSIN WHO JUST- THE LEADERSHIP WHO ACTUALLY JUST RECENTLY PASSED- OUR CAPTAIN WRESTLE FROM. LAST WEEK. AND IT'S FAMILY GATHERINGS- SO WHEN I GREW UP I THAT THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DOING I THOUGHT THEY WERE JUST FAMILY PICNICS AND BUT THEY WERE ACTUALLY TRIBAL GATHERINGS- BECAUSE EVENING THEN THEY WEREN'T. THEY DIDN'T FEEL IT WAS SAFE. FOR US TO TOTALLY KNOW EVERYTHING- WE ARE VERY PROTECT WE ARE VERY. CLOSE KNIT- OUR TRIBE AND- WE HAVE ARE STORY TELLERS WHO HAD LEARNED FROM THEIR GREAT GRANDMOTHERS AND GRANDFATHERS THE STORIES AND THEY WOULD SHARE THOSE STORIES BUT BASS- UNFORTUNATELY. A LOT OF THE LANGUAGE. WAS LOST BUT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REGAIN ACKNOWLEDGE- RECAPTURE IT FREE CLAIM IT AS OUR OWN AGAIN- THROUGH. OUR SISTER TRIBES. AND THEIR PROGRAMS AND IN FACT I'M SO JEALOUS WHEN I HEAR DOCTOR RODRIGUEZ SPEAK IN HIS NATIVE TONGUES I'VE ACTUALLY PERSONALLY BEEN TAKING LANGUAGE CLASSES ONLINE. FOR OVER TWO AND A HALF YEARS- THROUGH A PROGRAM THAT WAS DEVELOPED BY PITANGA. ALMOND SO I'M INCREDIBLY GRATEFUL FOR OUR OUR SISTER TRIBES FOR BEING ABLE TO KEEP THAT. ONE OF THE EXCITING PARTS ABOUT BEING CALIFORNIAN TO IN TODAY- AS A MEMBER OF MY OWN TRY IT IS. A LOT OF THE KNOWLEDGE THAT IS SHARED BY THE OF THE LISTEN YOU KNOW AS THROUGH DIFFERENT ANTHROPOLOGISTS AND ETHNOGRAPHERS- THEY CAME BACK FROM INFORMANTS INFORMANTS WERE- TRIBAL PEOPLE- AT THE DAY IN WHO NEEDED THE MONEY. TO SURVIVE AND SO THEY WOULD SHARE WITH THESE ETHNOGRAPHERS- WORDS LANGUAGE HI IMPORTANT PLACES- IN THE CULTURE- SPECIFICS CEREMONIES WHAT THEY MEANT AND WHAT WE'RE LEARNING IS BILLS WERE ACTUALLY SALAS RAY. MEMBERS AND THEY WERE SHARING THAT INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THEIR FATES WERE GOING TO BE. BUT THEY WANTED IT TO BE FOUND ONE DAY. AND SO NOW IT'S SAFE FOR US TO COME BACK AND WE CLAIM THAT INFORMATION AND SO THAT WE CAN BECOME STRONGER WITH IT. IT SUCKS A STORY A FULL CIRCLE AND- BECAUSE OF THEIR PERSEVERANCE WE CAN CONTINUE IT AND PROVIDE IT TO MY OWN CHILDREN AND HOPEFULLY MY GRANDCHILDREN. THREE BOYS SEEN A NUMBER NOW. BUT. IT'S DEFINITELY ONE OF THOSE STORIES- WHERE IN ORDER FOR OUR TRIED TO STILL BE A TRY IT TAKES A STRONG COMMITMENT TO ONE ANOTHER AND A BELIEF ANNA THAT AND HOPE. THAT WE WILL. ATTAIN WHAT IT IS THAT WAS- TASKS- BECAUSE OUR LAND WAS OURS FOR EVER. AND WE HAD. TO BE FOR TO BE TAKEN AWAY THE WEIGHT WISE AND THEN FOR US TO STILL BE FIGHTING FOR OUR PLACE. IT HAS TO BE ACT FIVE SORRY THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER- AND THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE CENTERS AND DOCTOR A CATCHER IS IN BALI THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND IT AND LIGHTNING. THE HISTORY OF THIS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA PEOPLE AS A WHOLE. AT THIS TIME WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND SEE IF THERE'S ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. I DID WANT TO SAY ONE THING AND THAT IS THEM BECAUSE I WROTE ACTUALLY A PAPER ABOUT THIS WHICH I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU ALL TO LOOK INTO. THERE WAS A PIECE OF LEGISLATION PASSED THE YEAR BEFORE KNACK PRO WAS PASSED FEDERALLY IN CALIFORNIA CALLED AB TWO FIVE SEVEN SEVEN. HAS PASSED THE TIME BY. A LEGISLATOR HIS NAME WAS RICHARD KATZ. IT WAS DIRECTLY TO ENCOURAGE ANY CALIFORNIA INSTITUTION TO RETURN INDIGENOUS HUMAN REMAINS IF THEY RECEIVED ANY SORT OF FUNDING FROM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. IT WAS FAR MORE. INFORMED AND ALSO HAD A LOT MORE TEETH THAN THAT PRESS ANYTHING AND ACTUALLY THAN THE CURRENT CAL MAG PRESS. AND IT ACTUALLY HAD IN IT- FINES FOR INSTITUTIONS THAT DIDN'T COMPLETE REPATRIATION OF THOSE REMAINS WITHIN LIKE TEN YEARS. AND HE ACTUALLY PASSED IT BECAUSE AT THE TIME HE WAS WORKING WITH CALIFORNIA INDIANS AND HE WAS A MAN OF JEWISH DESCENT AND HE SORT OF UNDERSTOOD THAT THIS CONNECTION BETWEEN THE HOUSING OF REMAINS. AND THE HOLOCAUST AND GENOCIDE THAT IT HAD THAT THIS HAPPENED WAS UNACCEPTABLE AND THE BILL PASSED IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE AND WAS GOING TO BE APPROVED IN AT THE TIME GOVERNOR DEUKMEJIAN VETOED IT. AND HE DID THAT BECAUSE THE UC SYSTEM STEPPED IN AND WROTE A SERIES OF LETTERS SAYING THAT IT WOULD DESTROY THE EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION. IF THEY RETURN TO THAT NUMBER OF REMAINS TO CALIFORNIA IN PEOPLE. SO HE HAD WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH CALIFORNIANS TO DEVELOP THAT LEGISLATION IT'S ALL STILL IN EXISTENCE YOU CAN READ THE WHOLE THING. THERE'S LIKE THAT THE WHOLE THING WAS PASSED AND THEN DID MASON VETOED IT SO I. WOULD SAY THAT THAT LEGISLATION ALREADY EXISTS IT WAS ALREADY PASSED IT WAS ALREADY IN SUPPORT LIKE THERE WAS A LOT OF SUPPORT IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR IT. HE WAS ONLY THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME THAT WE DID IT. AND THERE'S A LOT OF INFORMATION OUT THERE ABOUT HOW YOU CAN TAKE THAT AND DEVELOP LEGISLATION THAT ACTUALLY IS REALLY POWERFUL FOR THE RETURN OF REMAINS- NOW. BECAUSE HE HAD ALREADY. DONE THAT IN CONSULTATION WITH TRIBAL GROUPS AT THE TIME. THANK YOU OF ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT. NOT REALLY.
