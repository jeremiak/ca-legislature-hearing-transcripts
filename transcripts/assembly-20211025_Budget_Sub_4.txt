RELATING TO UPDATES WITH. AND REFORMS TO THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. ADDITIONALLY WE WELCOME THE CHAIRS OF THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE ASSEMBLY MEMBER RUDY SALAS AND SENATOR JOHN LAYERED. AND I RESPECTED MEMBERS IN ATTENDANCE TODAY. THE CONCERNS OVER THE DEPARTMENT'S HANDLING OF UNEMPLOYMENT AND DISABILITY INSURANCE DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES ARE VERY. WELL DOCUMENTED. FEW ISSUES MATTER MRE TO CALIFORNIANS THAN A PROPERLY FUNCTION EDT. IN THESE TIMES OF ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY MANY FAMILIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE RELY ON TIMELY UNEMPLOYMENT PAYMENTS TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND FOOD ON THEIR FAMILY'S TABLE. THE PANDEMIC HAS CLEARLY DEMONSTRATED. THAT SAFETY NET PROGRAMS LIKE EDT HAVEN'T NEEDED LONG OVERDUE STRUCTURAL REFORMS THIS IS THE FIFTH HEARING. ON EDT. AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AS MANY NECESSARY TO ENSURE THE DEPARTMENT IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE. NO CALIFORNIANS HAVE TO FALL THROUGH THE GAPING HOLES OF A SAFETY NET DESIGNED. FOR ECONOMIC SECURITY. THE ECONOMIC FORECAST FOR CALIFORNIANS PROVIDE. ROOM FOR CONCERN AS WELL CALIFORNIA IS REPORTING. MORE THAN EIGHTY THOUSAND UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS FILED FOR THE WEEK ENDING OCTOBER SIXTEENTH REPRESENTING THE STATE'S HIGHEST TOTAL. IN SIX MONTHS. WELL EDIE'S BACKLOG HAS BACKLOG HAS FALLEN DRAMATICALLY APPROXIMATELY ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY NINE THOUSAND CLAIMS ARE IN THE THIRD WEEK BACKLOG AS OF OCTOBER NINTH. ADDITIONALLY NEW REPORTING LAST WEEK SHOW THAT SOME CLAIMANTS HAVE BEEN WAITING FOR UP TO TWENTY SIX WEEKS. FOR AN INITIAL ELIGIBILITY INTERVIEW THIS IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR THIS BODY REQUESTED THAT THE STATE AUDITOR LOOKING TO THE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS AND MADE A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO IMPROVE FUNCTIONALITY. UNDER THE DIRECTION OF THE LECTURE ASSEMBLY MEMBER SALAS WE WILL REVIEW THE PROGRAMS MADE. FOLLOWING THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDIT RELEASED IN JANUARY. AT TODAY'S HEARING WE WILL HEAR AND BOTH THE STATE I AND THE DEPARTMENT ON PROGRESS MADE IN THOSE IMPROVEMENTS. I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THE WORK OF THIS LEGISLATURE TO IMPROVE DEPARTMENT OPERATIONS. THIS BUDGET YEAR LOAN WE APPROVED SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION. FOR ADDITIONAL EDT STAFFING TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD BACKLOG FIVE POINT FIVE MILLION TO IMPLEMENT DIRECT DEPOSIT OPTIONS. ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION TO IMPROVE MULTI LINGUAL AXIS SIX MILLION. TO IMPROVE SECURITY BY REMOVING SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS FROM MAIL DOCUMENTS ELEVEN POINT FOUR MILLION TO FUND THE PLACEMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRAINED STAFF IN AMERICAN JOB CENTER STATEWIDE. IN ADDITION WE EXTENDED THE SUNSET DATE FOR CURRENT PAID FAMILY LEAVE WAGE REPLACEMENT RATE FOR ANOTHER YEAR WITHOUT THIS ACTION CURRENT. PAID FAMILY LEAVE WE TREAT THAT 70% FOR THOSE MAKING LESS THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTY PERCENT. FOR THOSE MAKING MORE THAN TWENTY TWO THOUSAND WILL REVERT TO THE PRE TWENTY EIGHTEEN RATE OF FIFTY FIVE PERCENT. WE ALSO SAW A NUMBER OF PIECES OF LEGISLATION SIGNED INTO LAW THAT ADDRESS EDT CONCERNS. AB TWELVE REQUIRES STATE AGENCIES NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1-202-020-2020 THREE. TO STOP SENDING ONGOING UNITED STATES MAIL TO INDIVIDUALS THAT CONTAINED. THE INDIVIDUAL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER UNLESS THE NUMBER IS TRUNCATED TO WITH THE LAST FOUR DIGITS AB FIFTY SIX CODIFIES VARIOUS RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE STATE AUDITOR REPORTS RELATED TO EMPLOYMENT. DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT'S EDT PRACTICES. ABOUT PERSONAL INFORMATION ON OUTGOING MAIL CROSS MATCHING AGAINST INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS INFORMATION OVERPAYMENTS AND BACKLOG CLOSE. AB ONE TEN REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION. TO PROVIDE THE NAMES AND SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS TO CURRENT INMATES TO THE EDT DEPARTMENT TO PREVENT. PAYMENTS ON FRAUDULENT CLAIMS FOR UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION BENEFITS AND WOULD REQUIRE EDT TO CROSS MATCH THAT INFORMATION BEFORE ANY PAYMENT OF UNEMPLOYMENT COMPENSATION BENEFITS AS PROVIDED. AB THREE NINE SEVEN REQUIRES EIGHTY DEEP BEFORE DISQUALIFYING AN INDIVIDUAL AND SUBJECT SUBJECT SUBJECT TAKING. THAT PERSON TO A PERIOD OF INELIGIBILITY FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BENEFITS TO PROVIDE NOTICE TO THE INDIVIDUAL. OF THE PROPOSED THAT TERMINATIONS AND REASONS FOR IT THIS BILL ALSO GIVES INDIVIDUALS THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT ANY ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENTS NOTED IN THE PROPOSED A TERMINATION BEFORE A FINAL NOTICE OF DISQUALIFICATION. AB THREE NINETY REQUIRES EDT TO DEVELOP AN IMPLEMENTATION OF RECESSION PLAN TO PREPARE FOR INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE COMPENSATION BENEFITS DUE TO AN ECONOMIC RECESSION. THIS WORK HAS HELPED REDUCE BACKLOG AND PROVIDE EASY DEAL WITH THE STAFF AND RESOURCES IT NEEDS TO PROVIDE SERVICES DURING THESE UNPRECEDENTED TIMES AND AMEND. IT IS CLEAR THAT THERE IS MORE WORK TO BE DONE I HOPE THAT TODAY'S HEARING WILL BE. BOTH GIVE US N UPDATE ON DEPARTMENT. FUNCTION HIGHLIGHT AREAS WHERE IMPROVEMENT IS NEEDED AND BEGIN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A PLAN FOR THE FUTURE. WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO ALLOW MEMBERS PARTICIPATING IN TODAY'S HEARING TO MAKE ANY. OPENING REMARKS. PLEASE LET ME KNOW IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH BETWEEN OURS. THANK YOU. YEAH. YOU SHOULD BE OKAY ALL RIGHT HI MIKE WE'RE READY ALL RIGHT WELL GOOD MORNING AND GOOD MORNING EVERYONE I AM ASSEMBLY WOMAN KIND OF PETRIE-NORRIS AND I CHAIRED THE ASSEMBLY'S ACCOUNTABILITY AND ADMINISTRATIVE REVIEW COMMITTEE AS WE ALL KNOW WHEN HE COVERED NINETEEN PANDEMIC STRUCK AND BUSINESSES ALL ACROSS OUR STATE WERE- FORCED TO SHUTTER THEIR DOORS MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS WERE LEFT UNEMPLOYED AND CALIFORNIA'S EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT FACED AN UNPRECEDENTED SURGE IN. CLAIMS AND- AS CHAIR CARILLO NOTED IT'S BEEN QUITE WELL DOCUMENTED THAT TO THE DEPARTMENT WAYS COMPLETELY UNPREPARED FOR THIS DELUGE AND THE FALLOUT- WAS HEARTBREAKING WE SAW MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS DESPERATE. FOR BENEFITS AND UNABLE TO. I GET PHONE CALLS ANSWERED EMAILS RETURNED OR PAYMENTS RECEIVED. THE REASON THAT AT THAT ARE COMMITTEE AND THAT I PERSONALLY HAVE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE IS BECAUSE WHEN AN AGENCY. FAILS THIS WAY WHEN AN AGENCY ONE OF OUR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES FAILS THIS BADLY I BELIEVE THAT IT BREAKS THE PUBLIC TRUST IT REALLY ERODES PEOPLE'S FAITH IN GOVERNMENT AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE BEEN SO FOCUSED ON EDT SINCE THE EARLY STAGES OF THIS PANDEMIC I. ENSURING THAT WE ADDRESS THE IMMEDIATE FAILURES ENSURING THAT WE ADDRESS THE ROOT CAUSES OF THESE ISSUES AND ENSURING THAT WE TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO MAKE SURE THIS NEVER HAPPENS AGAIN- FOR CALIFORNIANS SO LOOKING FORWARD TO TODAY'S CONVERSATION TODAY TASTE HEARING AND RECEIVING AN UPDATE ON PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN MADE. ON CUSTOMER SERVICE ON PROCESS AND OPERATIONS AND ON IMPROVING FRAUD PREVENTION STRATEGIES AS WELL NOT SO WITH THAT. WILL OPEN UP FOR WHO'S EVER NEXT THANK YOU.

WHICH IS WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY AND QUITE FRANKLY HELP WITH COURAGE DDD TO EMPLOYMENT FIXES. IT'S BEEN OVER A YEAR AND A HALF SINCE UNEMPLOYMENT FIRST SPIKED BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. AND IT'S BEEN OVER SIX MONTHS NOW SINCE THE STATE AUDITOR PRODUCE THE AUDIT REPORT. THAT WE REQUESTED REGARDING EDTA. IN THAT REPORT THE STATE AUDITOR MADE. MANY RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WOULD HELP ENSURE CALIFORNIANS ARE RECEIVING THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TODAY I'M HOPING TO HEAR FROM EDT IN THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE. ON WHETHER OR NOT SIGNIFICANT PROFIT FROM PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE- ON WHETHER CALIFORNIANS ARE RECEIVING THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. AND WHETHER FRAUD IS BEING HELD IN CHECK. YOU KNOW I TELL YOU BASED ON THE STREAM OF CALLS MY OFFICE CONTINUES TO RECEIVE- MANY FROM FRUSTRATED CONSTITUENTS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I'M GUESSING THAT ALL THE PROBLEMS AND ISSUES HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY RESOLVED EVEN AFTER ALL THIS TIME IT'S PAST. THAT SAID WE ALL WANT EDT TO BE SUCCESSFUL MY COLLEAGUES AND I AUTHORED AT THE GOVERNOR SIGNED A NUMBER OF COMMONSENSE MEASURES. TO IMPROVE EDT. OUR COLLECTIVE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE EDT IS STEPPING UP TO PROTECT TAXPAYERS STOP FRAUD.

THANK YOU AGAIN ASSEMBLY WOMAN CARILLO ASSEMBLY MEMBER- PETRIE-NORRIS PROVIDING J. LASKIN ALLOWING US TO PARTICIPATE TODAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER SALAS SENATOR. THANK YOU FOR. LET'S SEE IF THAT WORKS. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MADAM CHAIR AND I TO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE AND BOB I WAS GOING TO DO EXACTLY WHAT CHAIR SALAS DID MANAGE KNOWLEDGE OUR AUDITOR FOR LIKE THE SERVICE AND I WORKED WITH HER AS A CHAIR OF JAIL LIKE WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AS A CABINET SECRETARY AND NOW. AND SHE HAS REALLY LED THE WAY ON MAJOR ISSUES AND REALLY HELP THE LEGISLATURE DRESS THEM DURING HER TENURE AND SHE WILL HAVE BIG SHOES TO FILL A FILL I'M ALSO. AMAZED AT THIS IS THE LAST HEARING IN THISROW OF HAVING CHAIRED MANY BUDGET HEARINGS IN THIS FROM HAVING STARTED MY CAREER OUT AS AN EMPLOYEE OF THE GUY WHOSE PICTURES BEHIND THEIR- BEFORE THE CHAIR MIGHT HAVE BEEN BORN. MMHM IT I HAVE STARED AT IT MANY TIMES AND I HOPE THAT THAT- PICTURE MAKES IT TO THE NEW. OF BUILDING. A WE HAD A HEARING ON THE MAJOR AUDIT THAT WAS DONE AT J. WACK. AND DURING THAT MANY OF US OUTLINED THE HARDSHIPS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCED BY OUR CONSTITUENTS AND PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE. I DON'T WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF US STAND BY THEM BUT THEY STILL EXIST IN MANY WAYS AND- AND THE WHOLE STORY OF A- A PROFESSOR LIVING IN HER CAR- UP TO HAVE A CAR PHONE RATE. IT COULD NOT GET THE MONEY TO JUST MAKE IT THROUGH THAT WAS REALLY POWERFUL ONE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT I THINK. MOTIVATE US TO TAKE THE ACTIONS WE HAVE TO TAKE. AND I APPRECIATE THE DISPLAY OF SHOUT OUT FROM- SURE SALAS BECAUSE BASICALLY SINCE THAT HERE AND MANY OF US. TOOK AUDIT RECOMMENDATIONS PUT THEM INTO LEGISLATION AND THEY HAVE BEEN ENACTED AND SIGNED. IN AND THE ONE THAT I DID WAS REALLY THE AUDITOR AFTER SIMILAR THINGS HAPPENED IN THE GREAT RECESSION OF TWO THOUSAND NINE MADE A SIMILAR RECOMMENDATION. IT WAS INDEED HERE TO BUY THE GOVERNOR AT THE TIME. IT WASN'T HERE TO BUY THE NEXT GOVERNOR AND NOW THIRD GOVERNOR IS FACING THE EXACT SAME THING. OF I SAY THAT TO POINT OUT THAT THIS ISN'T ONE GOVERNOR THIS IS BIPARTISAN WHAT WHAT HAS GONE ON HERE. BUT BASICALLY. OF THE BILL THAT WAS CO AUTHORED. BY PEOPLE OF BOTH SIDES OF THE ISLAND BOTH HOUSES. REALLY SAID THAT WILL BE READY. ARE ON AN ONGOING OF ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT BASIS. TO BE READY ANYTIME THERE'S AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WITH THE STEPS THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO GEAR UP IMMEDIATELY AND I. APPRECIATE EVERYBODY. ON THE DICE IS A CO AUTHOR VOTED FOR IT AND I THINK THAT AS WE HEAD INTO TODAY'S HEARING. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE TAKEN SOME OF THE STRONGEST FIRST STEPS AS OUTLINED BY THE CHAIR IN THE BUDGET. AND OUTLINED BY THE CHAIR OF J. LACK OF- WITH REGARD TO POLICY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO THE TESTIMONY. A TO SEE WHAT FURTHER STEPS WE MIGHT HAVE TO DO. TO BOTH DEAL WITH THE REMAINING PROBLEMS NOW AND THE FACT THAT THIS WILL NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN SO THANKYOU AGAIN FOR. INVITING ME THANK YOU SENATOR AND NOW THE VICE. CHAIR BUDGETS BEFORE MISTER LUCKY. WHAT I YOU OF MADAM CHAIR PER. FOR ORGANIZING- THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT HEARING IN. PERMISSION TO USE A PROP. YEAH PERMISSION TO USE A PROPER QUICKLY. AS I JUST INDICATED EACH OF YOU MY FRUSTRATION THAT I'D LIKE TO EXPRESS TO YOU AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT HAS TO DO WITH THE FRAUDULENT DISPERSED. PAYMENTS BUT TOLD. HELLO BILL. DOLLARS AND I KNOW THIS IS HARD TO DIFFICULT AND HARD AND DIFFICULT TO PROCESS. BECAUSE WE HEAR REFERENCES TO NUMBERS ALL THE TIME AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE OF CAPTURED. IN THEIR MIND THE ENORMITY OF THE AMOUNT OF MONEY THERE'S BEEN ISSUED. ERRANT WAY. TO UNDESERVING PEOPLE. OF THIS WASTE OF MONEY COULD A PURCHASED. SIXTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE CALIFORNIA HOMES. AT THE MEDIUM PRICE POINT PAID FOR CALIFORNIA HOME. AND IT KIND OF ALSO PAID FOR FOUR YEARS OF SCHOOLING AND THE UC UNIVERSITY AND THOSE THAT TOTAL OF STUDENTS WOULD AMOUNT TO TWO THOUSAND SIXTY FIVE. AND IT'S ALSO FOR BILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE ENTIRE OPERATING BUDGET OF THE CSU SYSTEM. INSTEAD OF THOSE DAYS WHERE THE OPPORTUNITIES THIS MONEY IS GOING TO UNDESERVING PEOPLE BUT A PURCHASE LUXURY GOODS AND ALL SORTS OF SQUANDERS. THERE'S ABSOLUTELY NO REASON THAT IT INDEED CONTINUES TO CODDLE THESE OFFENDERS BY PAYING THEM THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO THIS ONGOING PANDEMIC. OUR DISTRICT OFFICE CONTINUES TO DO THE JOB OF THE DAY. MY OFFICE HAS PERSONALLY ALERTED THE DEPARTMENT TO SEVERAL CASES THAT WERE OBVIOUSLY- FRAUDULENT LETTERS LIKE TO SHARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES REAL QUICKLY. THE LARGEST BOONDOGGLE WE UNCOVERED WAS A CLAIM FILED BY KIMBERLY L. WILL COLOR KIMBERLY L. SHE WAS PAID FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS A WEEK PLUS THREE HUNDRED AND FEDERAL BENEFITS FOR THREE MONTHS. WINNER CLAIMS STALLED SHE OPENED ANOTHER CASE IN KANSAS WHAT ARE LAYS ON TO SCRUTINIZED HER CLAIM SHE DISCOVERED OVER ONE HUNDRED FRAUDULENT CLAIMS ALL LISTED THE SAME. APARTMENT UPON FURTHER INVESTIGATION THE LIES ON AND HER MANAGER HAVE SHUT DOWN OVER TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY FRAUDULENT CLAIMS SPANNING SIX STATES. THE WORK OF THESE CLAIMS ARE STILL ON GOING AND THERE WERE NO IDEA WAGE VERIFICATION REQUIRED. WHICH IS COMMON IN THESE CASES. ANOTHER EXAMPLES TRC WHO HAD OF VIRGINIA'S DRIVER'S LICENSE AND APPLIED FOR BENEFITS IN AUGUST. AFTER APPLYING SHE SAID IN SIX REQUEST TO BACKDATE YOUR CLAIM AFTER BEING REFUSED FIVE TIMES WITH DOCUMENTATION IN HER FILE. THE SIX THE TAP WAS BACKDATED TO MID MARCH THE PAID OUT FOR THREE MONTHS. SHE WAS DISQUALIFIED SEVERAL TIMES AND THERE WERE MULTIPLE PEOPLE AT THE SAME ADDRESS. BUT THROUGH THE ASK YOU D. D. SYSTEM SHE WAS ABLE TO RECEIVE A HUNDRED SEVENTY FOUR DOLLARS A WEEK. PLUS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN FEDERAL BENEFITS. BUT MANY MORE EXAMPLES AND I'M NOT GOING TO. BURDEN YOU WITH AT THIS PARTICULAR MOMENT HOWEVER EDT HAD NOT DETECTED ANY OF THESE CASES. AN UNPAID AMOUNT UNTIL MY OFFICE STEPPED IN AND ASK QUESTIONS EDT PERSONNEL TOLD US THAT THESE CASES REPRESENT RED FLAGS AND THAT THE SYSTEM. IS OKAY. BUT NOTHING HAS BEEN DONE TO REALLY STOP AT THAT WE'RE AWARE OF. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION AHEAD AND IN THIS MEETING TO SEE HOW THAT WE CAN OF COURSE BASIC GUARDRAILS. ON THESE PARTICULAR FUNDS PROVIDED BY TAXPAYERS EIGHTEEN MONTHS INTO THE PANDEMIC. SO THE WE DO NOT FILL THE THIRTY DUMP TRUCKS WITH WASTED PAYMENTS. AND THAT'S ALL I HAVE MEANT. THANK YOU MR LACKEY I THINK YOU POINT OUT A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM THAT IS. A BIPARTISAN ISSUE THAT WE HAVE ALL BEEN TRYING IS. TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR- WE WILL BEGIN OUR PANEL NO FIRST WE WOULD OUR FIRST PANEL WE WILL NOW HEAR FROM OUR STATE AUDITOR MISS ELAINE HOWELL AND HER STAFF UP HARRIS ON THEIR UPDATES TO THE AUDIT AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. WELCOME. HOPEFULLY THIS IS ON. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIRED CARILLO PETRIE-NORRIS AND CERTAINLY CHAIR SALAS- FOR. YOU KELLY HI THE VOLUME OF THAT PLEASE. OKAY WELL I'LL SPEAK UP THEN- SO FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS ELAINE HALL IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR TO MY RIGHT IS BOB HARRIS MR HARRIS WAS THE AUDIT MANAGER ON THIS PARTICULAR PROJECT I KNOW OUR- THE SERGEANT HAS HANDED OUT. COPIES OF THE AUDIT REPORT AND A HAND OUT RELATED TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS MISTER HARRIS WILL STEP YOU THROUGH. THE HAND OUT RELATED TO THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE STATUS OF DD'S PROGRESS AND CERTAINLY ON THE LAST PAGE OF KNOWLEDGE IN A LOT OF LEGISLATIVE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE. WHAT I INTEND TO DO VERY QUICKLY. IS TO GIVE YOU A BRIEF. OVERVIEW ARE REFRESHER OF THE ISSUES THAT WE IDENTIFIED IN THE TWO ARTISTS WE ISSUED IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE- AS YOU KNOW THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. APPROVED AN EMERGENCY REQUEST IN THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY IN SEPTEMBER. WE COMBINE THAT WITH OUR HIGH RISK AUTHORITY TO GIVE US THE ABILITY TO CONDUCT. A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT OBJECTIVES- AND LOOKING AT EDT. SO THREE KEY AREAS I'M GOING TO TALK ABOUT THE FIRST IS THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS. THE SECOND IS RELATED TO THEIR CALL CENTER AND THEIR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND THE THIRD AREAS LOOKING AT FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION WHAT THEIR EFFORTS WERE WHAT TOOLS THEY USE IT CENTER. SO THE FIRST ISSUE RELATED TO CLAIMS PROCESSING THIS HAS BEEN A HISTORIC AS CENTER LAYERED INDICATED. AFTER THE RECESSION BACK IN TWO THOUSAND NINE THE LEGISLATURE ASKED US THROUGH THE JOINT LEGISLATIVE AUDIT COMMITTEE. ASKED US TO CONDUCT AN AUDIT OF EDT AND ITS ABILITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS PARTICULARLY IN A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE IS A RECESSION. UNEMPLOYMENT INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY. WE ISSUED A REPORT IN MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN AND FOUND THEY HAD STRUGGLES IN. PROCESSING CLAIMS THEY HAVEN'T ASSESSED THEIR STAFFING THEIR CALL CENTER WAS. PERFORMING VERY POORLY ANSWERED LESS THAN 10% OF THE CALLS THAT GOT WORSE DURING THE PANDEMIC. BUT THEY REALLY STRUGGLE SO WE MADE A VARIETY OF RECOMMENDATIONS TO EDT TO IMPROVE. THEIR CALL CENTER TO PROVIDE TRAINING TO THEIR STAFF TO AUTOMATE CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THEIR CLAIMS PROCESSING. WE CONDUCTED A FOLLOW UP ON IT NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWELVE UNFORTUNATELY FOUND SOME OF THE SAME- ISSUES STILL HAPPENING. STRUGGLING WITH PROCESSING CLAIMS THEY HAD IMPROVE THEIR CALL CENTER SOME BUT THEY ACTUALLY LOST SOME IMPORTANT FUNCTIONALITY AND I'LL TALK ABOUT THAT. WHEN I TALK ABOUT THE ISSUE RELATED TO THE CALL CENTER. SO WE CONDUCTED THIS AUDIT AGAIN ON. AT THE DIRECTION OF THE LEGISLATURE AND CERTAINLY UNDER HIGH RISK IT ALREADY. AND FOUND AGAIN THEY WERE CONTINUING TO STRUGGLE TO PROCESS CLAIMS AND CERTAINLY IN THE PANDEMIC. ALL OF THE ISSUES THAT EDT HAD EXPERIENCE IN THE PAST WERE EXACERBATED BECAUSE YOU YOU HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE. SEEKING HELP SEEKING UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS THROUGH THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT. SO WHEN WE LOOK AT THEIR ABILITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS WE FOUND THAT CLOSE 250% OF THOSE CLAIMS. WERE GETTING KICKED OUT WHERE THEY HAVE TO MANUALLY DO SOME ANALYSIS AND DO SOME WORK WITH STATE THE PARTICULAR CONSTITUENT WHO IS TRYING TO GET BENEFITS. AND THAT JUST DIDN'T WORK IT WAS JUST TAKING WAY TOO LONG. TO TRY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS. WHAT DO YOU DO EIGHTY DID DO. AFTER AT THE RECOMMENDATION BASED ON THE STRIKE TEAM AT THE GOVERNOR PUT TOGETHER. WAS USING ID ME SO THAT REALLY DID ASSIST IN HELPING. VERIFY IDENTITIES OF INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE THAT WAS A HUGE ISSUE. AS FAR AS THE- ABILITY PROCESS CLAIMS SO THAT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY WHAT UP OTHER THINGS EDT DID IS THEY SUSPENDED CERTAIN THINGS- SUCH AS ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS. OTHER ISSUES THAT TEST TO- QUICK AND GET THOSE CLAIMS PROCESS MORE QUICKLY EXPEDITE PROCESSING OF CLAIMS. THOSE ARE THINGS THAT THEY CAN NOT DO. LONG TERM BECAUSE IF THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SOME OF THOSE THINGS BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC. THERE WERE SOME A PANDEMIC PROGRAMS THAT CAME OUT OF CONGRESS THAT WERE NEW PROGRAMS. SUCH AS THE POOR PROGRAM. PANDEMIC UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE AND THIS IS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SELF EMPLOYED. SO THERE'S REALLY A DIFFICULT ABILITY TO CONFIRM THEIR- THEIR INCOME THEIR WAGES- SO EDT SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO DO THAT LET'S JUST GO AHEAD AND GET SOME OF THOSE CLAIMS PROCESS UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THOSE. ULTIMATELY ENDED UP AS FRAUDULENT CLAIMS SO THE CLAIMS PROCESSING PRACTICES WERE REALLY- THEY CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE- AND CERTAINLY AS I SAID THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATED THOSE PROBLEMS. NOW THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I JUST MENTIONED IS THEY DELAYED CERTAIN CRITICAL WORK. TO TWO KEY THINGS SUSPENDING ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS THIS IS A REQUIREMENT THAT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE ABLE AND AVAILABLE TO WORK. AND FOR ABOUT A TEN MONTH PERIOD BETWEEN MARCH AND DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY THEY SUSPENDED THOSE REQUIREMENTS DIDN'T EXPECT PEOPLE TO PROVE THAT SO. NOW THEY HAVE WHEN WE ISSUED THE REPORT. IT AFFECTED ABOUT TWO POINT FOUR MILLION CLAIMANTS WILL CLOSE TO TWELVE MILLION ISSUES- THE REASON WE IDENTIFIED THIS IS THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR WHEN THEY BECAME AWARE THAT EDT HAD SUSPENDED THIS REQUIREMENT. TOLD THE STATE YOU CAN'T DO THAT YOU'VE GOT TO REQUIRE THESE FOLKS TO. DETERMINE YOU KNOW SUBMIT THINGS TO SO THAT YOU CAN DETERMINE THEY ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE BENEFITS. SIMILARLY THERE'S A PROCESS WHERE SOMEONE HAS TO SUBMIT A BI WEEKLY CERTIFICATION EVERY TWO WEEKS I AM SEEKING EMPLOYMENT I'M TRYING TO GET A JOB. EDT SUSPENDED THAT AS WELL FOR ABOUT AN EIGHT WEEK EIGHT WEEK PERIOD BETWEEN MID MARCH OF TWENTY TWENTY. AND MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY AGAIN- THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF LABOR BECAME AWARE OF THIS- HAD CONCERNS AND INFORM THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU CANNOT DO THAT YOU'VE GOT TO REINSTITUTE THOSE. SO THAT SITUATION THERE IS ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN MILLION CLAIMANTS AFFECTED BY THAT SO HUGE DEFERRED WORKLOAD THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THE ART REPORT MISTER HARRIS WILL TALK ABOUT. SOME OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO WORKLOAD PLANNING HOW ARE YOU GOING TO ADDRESS YOUR ABILITY TO PROCESS CLAIMS AS THEY CONTINUE TO COME IN. BUT NOW DEAL WITH THIS DEFERRED WORKLOAD THAT YOU HAVE SO YOU HAVE BASICALLY ACCUMULATED BECAUSE YOU SUSPENDED THOSE THOSE TWO KEY- CONTROLS KEY PARTS OF YOUR PROGRAM. SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY ISSUES RELATED TO PROCESSING YOU KNOW ESTABLISH. IDENTIFYING WHAT YOUR WORKLOAD IS THEY DEFERRED SOME THINGS NOW THEY HAVE THAT WORKLOAD. SKEWS ME ON TOP OF THEIR EXISTING WORKLOAD. THE CALL CENTER THE SECOND ISSUE THAT WE TALK ABOUT IN THE REPORT. AS YOU KNOW HOW MANY OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS TRY TO CALL EDT TO TRY TO GET ASSISTANCE CAN'T EVEN GET THROUGH. WHEN THEY DO GET THROUGH THEY GET AN INDIVIDUAL WHO PERHAPS HASN'T WORKED FOR EDT VERY LONG CAN'T ANSWER THEIR QUESTIONS- THERE WASN'T THE ABILITY FOR CONSTITUENTS TO CALL IN AND LEAVE A NUMBER SO THAT THEY COULD BE CALLED BACK. THAT WAS ONE OF THE- ASCENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY. THAT THEIR PRIOR SYSTEM HAD THEIR NEW SYSTEM HABIT BUT THEY HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED THEY HAVEN'T ESTABLISHED IT. SO THERE WAS NO CALL BACK OPTION THERE WERE NO PRE RECORDED MESSAGES FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO MAYBE JUST WANTED. TO GET A QUESTION ANSWERED AND IT IF THERE WAS AN AUTOMATED SYSTEM THAT ALLOWED THEM TO GET THAT ANSWER. THEN THEY WOULDN'T BE FRUSTRATED BY BEING ON HOLD OR HAVING TO CALL BACK OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN. TO TRY TO GET THROUGH TO. TO AN INDIVIDUAL- SO THIS THIS PERFORMANCE EVEN IF IT WAS IT WAS POOR BEFORE THE PANDEMIC IT JUST GOT. MISERABLE I MEAN WAS LESS THAN 1% OF PEOPLE WERE GETTING THROUGH TO SOMEONE AND IMAGINE TRYING TO GET THROUGH AND THEN GETTING TO SOMEONE WHO. DOESN'T HAVE THE NECESSARY TRAINING NO FAULT TO THEM THEY THEY DID HIRE MORE PEOPLE BUT THOSE PEOPLE DIDN'T HAVE THE EXPERTISE. TO HELP FOLKS SO YOU GET THROUGH AFTER CALLING MULTIPLE TIMES. AND THEN YOU TALK TO SOMEONE WHO CAN'T HELP YOU. VERY FRUSTRATING FOR CONSTITUENTS. THE OTHER THING IS WE IDENTIFIED THIS BACK IN TWENTY TWELVE AND TWENTY ELEVEN. THEY WEREN'T ANALYZING ANY FIRST CALL RESOLUTION SO WERE THEY RECORDING OKAY I ANSWERED THE LINE HOUSE CALL AND I WAS ABLE TO ANSWER HER QUESTION. LET'S RECORD THAT SO THAT WE KNOW WHAT ARE THE TYPES OF QUESTIONS THAT CONSTITUENTS ARE ASKING FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNEMPLOYED OR ASKING TO GET ASSISTANCE. THAT WOULD IDENTIFY. WAYS TO TRAIN OUR STAFF OR THINGS YOU COULD PUT ON THE WEBSITE AS A FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS SO SOMEONE DOESN'T EVEN NEED TO CALL IN. SO THEY WEREN'T ASSESSING FIRST CALL RESOLUTION THAT IS A BEST PRACTICE OUT THERE IN THE INDUSTRY. THEY WEREN'T TRACKING WHITE PEOPLE WERE CALLING- EDT. AND TRAINING THEIR STAFF AND AGAIN AS I SAID UPDATING THAT FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS. SO WE HAD A LOT OF CONCERNS RELATED TO THE CALL CENTER- WE MADE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO THAT CERTAINLY RELATED TO. USING THE FUNCTIONALITY THAT THAT SYSTEM HAS AS FAR AS ALLOWING FOR A CALL BACK OPTION. PUTTING PRE RECORDED MESSAGES OUT THERE SO THEY NEEDED TO DO A LOT OF THINGS TO REALLY IMPROVE THAT CALL CENTER. THE LAST AREA QUICKLY GO OVER AND THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MR HARRIS'S OF COURSE FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION- WHEN WE ISSUED THE REPORT IN JANUARY WE HAD ESTIMATED ABOUT TEN POINT FOUR BILLION- AND FRAUDULENT CLAIMS AND OR A VARIETY OF REASONS FOR THAT. WE IDENTIFIED. HI NUMBER OF SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES- AS YOU NOW I'M SURE SOME OF YOUR CONSTITUENTS WERE RECEIVING MULTIPLE MAILINGS AT THEIR HOME FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO DON'T EVEN RESIDE AT THAT ADDRESS. WE HAD ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT IN TWENTY NINETEEN. THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY COMMITTEE ASKED US TO LOOK AT EDT SENDING OUT DOCUMENTS WITH FULL SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS. WHY IS THE A FOLLOW UP ON THAT AUDIT NOVEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TO SEE IF THINGS HAD BEEN CORRECTED THEY HAD NOT BEEN SO. YOU HAVE A HUGE ISSUE OF IDENTITY THEFT. AND IN FACT WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDITS- THAT WE ISSUED IN JANUARY. WE HAD IDENTIFIED ABOUT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND CLAIMS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAD SUBMITTED TO EDT SAYING I THANK MY IDENTITY HAS BEEN STOLEN. COMPARE THAT TO CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY NINETEEN IT WAS SIX THOUSAND FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR. SO FOR ABOUT AN EIGHT MONTH WINDOW YOU'VE GOT SEVENTY SEVEN THOUSAND PEOPLE SAYING. I THANK MY IDENTITIES BEEN STOLEN YOU HAVE COUNTLESS OTHER INDIVIDUALS WHO AT THAT POINT TIME MAY NOT EVEN KNOW. THAT THEIR IDENTITY HAD BEEN STOLEN SO A HUGE ISSUE. AS FAR AS- NOT EDT NOT TAKING STEPS WHEN THEY KNEW THEY HAD SOME SUSPICIOUS ADRESSES. WE TALK IN THE AUDIT REPORT. WHERE THEY STARTED TO PUT SOME CONTROLS AROUND THAT BUT EVEN THEN WHEN WE LOOKED AT SOME OF THOSE ADDRESSES WE FOUND SOME THAT HAD NOT BEEN SUSPENDED THAT. WERE CLEARLY SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES SO THEY HADN'T TAKEN THE APPROPRIATE STEPS. TO TRY TO CLAMP DOWN ON. ON SOME OF A FRAUD THAT WAS OCCURRING. TO HIGH PROFILE ISSUES YOU'RE WELL AWARE OF THE BANK OF AMERICA WITH THE BENEFIT CARDS. FROZE OVER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND ACCOUNTS. OUR ISSUE IS I'S IMPORTANT TO BE ABLE TO FREEZE THOSE ACCOUNTS BUT YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THE NATURE OF. HOW MANY OF THOSE WERE LEGITIMATE BENEFIT BENEFICIARIES VERSUS ACTUAL POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT. SO THERE ARE PICKED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAD THEIR ACCOUNT FROZEN. THAT WERE LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS BUT EDT AND DIDN'T WORK WOULD BE OF A TO COME UP WITH A PROTOCOL FOR. LET'S CLEAR SOME OF THESE TO FREE UP THOSE ARE YOU KNOW ON FREEZE THOSE ACCOUNTS. SO WE REALLY HAD SOME CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THEY WERE WORKING WITH B. OF A- TO DETERMINE WHICH COUNTS SHOULD BE FROZEN WHICH SHOULD BE UNFROZEN THEY JUST. BASICALLY THE PENDULUM WAS SWINGING ONE WAY OR THE OTHER LET'S FREEZE EVERYTHING NOW LET'S ON FREEZE EVERYTHING IT WASN'T A GOOD STRATEGIC APPROACH. THE SECOND HIGH PROFILE ISSUE OF COURSE IS THE CROSS MATCHING- THIS IS WHERE. EDT WAS NOT CROSS MATCHING ITS INFORMATION WITH OUR STATE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS. AND CERTAINLY NOT WITH LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AS WELL AS LOCAL FACILITIES. DURING THE AUDIT WE AYE AYE WE IDENTIFIED ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS THAT HAD BEEN SENT OUT PAID OUT. UNDER THE NAMES OF INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY HAVE HAD THEIR IDENTITY STOLEN SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS MAY BE FRAUDULENTLY. OBTAINING BENEFITS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WERE CONCERNED ABOUT WHEN WE LOOKED WE FOUND A NATIONAL STUDY THAT HAD BEEN DONE IN TWENTY SIXTEEN WHERE THEIR WORKS UPWARDS OF THIRTY FIVE THIRTY SIX STATES THAT WE'RE DOING THIS CROSS MATCHING. AND IN FACT EDT BACK THEN HAD NOTIFIED THE LEGISLATURE THIS IS SOMETHING WE WANT TO DO. BUT HAD NEVER REALLY FOLLOWED THROUGH WITH IT- SO IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT SOME OF THE LEGISLATION ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE THIS WILL BE A HUGE CONTROL THAT WILL ALLOW EDT. TO IDENTIFY THOSE CROSS MATCHES AND THEN BE ABLE TO INVESTIGATE AND HOPEFULLY PREVENT. OF FRAUD IN THE FUTURE. AT THE LAST ISSUE RELATED TO FRAUD DETECTION AND PREVENTION WE WANT TO LOOK AT THEIR STRUCTURE WHAT KIND OF FRIED. A PROGRAM DOES EDT HAVE AND THEN WHEN YOU LOOK IN THE AUDIT REPORT. AND WE PRESENTED THIS SENATE AND A FIGURE THERE ARE A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT UNITS IT'S A BASICALLY A PATCHWORK. THERE ISN'T AN OVER. OVERVIEW OR ARE AN INDIVIDUAL OR UNIT THAT HAD RESPONSIBILITY FOR COORDINATING ALL THE FRAUD DETECTION PREVENTION EFFORTS. THAT EDT WAS ENGAGING AND IT WOULD. INDIVIDUALS HAD TO COMMUNICATE ACROSS DIFFERENT BRANCHES DIFFERENT UNITS WITHIN THE DAY IT WAS. IT WAS NOT AN EFFECTIVE PROCESS SO WE FELT THAT THEY NEEDED TO ESTABLISH A CENTRALIZED UNIT. ET WAS NOT MEASURING. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS PROVOKED PREVENTION AND DETECTION TOOL SO IT DIDN'T KNOW WHICH TOOLS WORK BETTER THAN OTHERS DO WE NEED TO CONTINUE USING THIS TOOL IS IT REALLY EFFECTIVE. IF THIS ONE'S NOT EFFECTIVE THEN LET'S NOT INVEST MORE RESOURCES IN THAT PARTICULAR TOOL. AND THE FINAL ISSUE RELATED TO THAT IS IF YOU'RE NOT ASSESSING YOUR TOOLS. YOU DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADJUST YOUR EFFORTS DURING A HIGH DEMAND- TIME FRAME. FOR EXAMPLE WE TALKED IN THE MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN REPORT AND THE FOLLOW UP. IN TWENTY TWELVE. ABOUT THAT RECESSION PLAN YOU NEED TO HAVE A RECESSION PLAN RECESSION HAPPENS EVERY FIVE TO SIX YEARS. SO YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN IN PLACE TO DEAL WITH THAT NOBODY CERTAINLY EXPECTED. THE THIS COUNTRY IN THIS WORLD TO HAVE TO BE DEALING WITH A PANDEMIC OF THIS. OF THIS ENORMITY BUT YOU IF WE HAD HAD A RECESSION PLAN. AT LEAST WE AS A STATE EDT WOULD HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS STAFFING. WHAT KIND OF WORKLOAD ISSUES DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS IT CETERA SO. AGAIN WE FEEL THAT THAT RECESSION PLAN WOULD HAVE TIED INTO SOME OF YOUR PREVENTION DETECTION TOOLS. WHICH ONES ARE AFFECTED WHICH ONES WE WANT TO KEEP USING. WHICH ONES ARE WE MORE COMFORTABLE BASICALLY DIALING BACK SO WE CAN FREE UP SOME OF THOSE STAFF TO DO OTHER THINGS. SO THOSE ARE THAT'S GOOD. VERY QUICK HOPEFULLY OVERVIEW A REFRESHER ON THE TWO ARTISTS THAT WE YOUR- JAN. OF TWENTY TWENTY. BECAUSE WE DID THESE AUDITS UNDER OUR HIGH RISK AUTHORITY AND CERTAINLY THE EMERGENCY I REQUEST THAT MEMBERS SIGNED ON. WE GET UPDATES FROM EIGHTY D. EVERY NINETY DAYS- MISTER HARRIS HAS BEEN. WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN FACT I THINK HE GOT SOME UPDATES S RECENTLY AS THIS PAST FRIDAY. I WAS GETTING EMAILS FROM HIM- SAYING HE WAS STILL WORKING WITH THE DUTY TO GET SOME FRESH CURRENT INFORMATION FOR THESE COMMITTEES TODAY. SO WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MISTER HARRISON HILL STEP YOU THROUGH THE HAND OUT THAT. WE PROVIDED TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU CHECK CORREO- ATTRIBUTES YOU NORRIS ENSURE SALAS- MY NAME IS BOB HARRIS I'M A PROJECT MANAGER MR HERS BEFORE YOU BEGIN WHICH OF THE DOCUMENTS ARE YOU REFERRING TO I'LL BE STEPPING THROUGH THIS HAND OUT- IT'S LEAR WHAT I THINK WITH THAT CLAIM PROCESSING. YES THIS THIS HAND OUT WE PROVIDE MY NAME'S BOB HARRIS WITH THE STATE OUT OFFICE I'M A PROJECT MANAGER- THIS HANDOUT IS THE MORNING I'LL BE WALKING YOU THROUGH. THE PROGRESS E. D.'S MATED ADDRESSING THE RECOMMENDATIONS. THERE ARE ESSENTIALLY THE FIRST THREE PAGES COVERS THE SAME SUBJECT AREAS THE STATE AUDITOR JUST COMMENTED ON CLAIMS PROCESSING THE CALL CENTER AND THEN FRAUD PREVENTION. AND DETECTION THE FINAL PAGES A SUMMARY OF THE LEGISLATIVE ACTIONS THAT WERE TAKEN THIS PAST YEAR- BY THIS COMMITTEE. CHAIR PETRIE-NORRIS TRISTE ALICE CENTER LAYERED- TO ADDRESS AREAS OF CONCERN THAT WE KNOW TO WHERE WE SAID THERE NEEDED TO BE LEGISLATIVE ACTION TAKEN. ALSO NOTE THERE ARE SEVERAL OF THE E. D. D. RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE DIRECTLY TO ET DE THAT THE LEGISLATURE ALSO ADOPTED AS PART OF LEGISLATION PARTICULARLY. ENSURE SALAS IS AB FIFTY SIX SO- THOSE IN ADDITION TO BEING RECOMMENDATIONS WE ARE CONTINUING TO FOLLOW UP ON ARE NOW ALSO STATUTORY REQUIREMENTS FOR EDT OR WILL BE. IN THE COMING YEAR- I'LL STEP THROUGH EACH OF THE SUBJECT AREAS ONE BY ONE IN A MOMENT BUT FIRST THERE'S A THERE'S A THREAD THAT RUNS THROUGH ALL OF THEM AND THAT'S ESSENTIALLY THIS. EDT HAS MADE NOTABLE PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE AREAS OF CONCERN THAT WE FOUND DURING OUR AUDITS. BUT SIGNIFICANT STEPS NOTE STILL NEED TO BE TAKEN TO ADDRESS AREAS OF RISK. WHERE IF HE DOESN'T CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THROUGH ON SOME OF THE INITIAL POSITIVE FIRST STEPS IS TAKEN. THEN IT WON'T FULLY REALIZE THE BENEFITS FOR CALIFORNIANS THAT NEED ITS ASSISTANCE. SO YOU'LL SEE THAT KIND OF THEME THROUGHOUT ALL THREE AREAS WE'LL START WITH CLAIMS PROCESSING ON PAGE ONE OF THE HAND OUT. IN THIS AREA EDT HAS TAKEN STEPS PARTICULARLY TO ADDRESS. THE PROBLEMS THAT WERE CAUSING CLAIMS TO NOT BE PROCESSED EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. YOU'LL SEE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF THAT PAGE UNDER THE JUNETWENTY TWENTY ONE. AREA THAT THEY HAVE ALREADY IDENTIFIED KEY PROBLEMS WITH IT SYSTEMS. THAT WERE CAUSING HANG UPS IN CLAIMS PROCESING. IMPROVEMENTS THAT THEY CAN MAKE TO MAKE SURE THE CLAIMS ARE PROCESS MORE EFFECTIVELY. BUT THAT WERE IN MARKING THOSE EITHER PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED RIGHT NOW OUR AND- IN THE CASE OF IDENTIFICATION THE IDENTIFICATION IS DONE. NOW EDT NEEDS TO CARRY OUT THOSE AND HIS SYSTEM IMPROVEMENTS SO THEY'VE MADE GOOD PROGRESS IN RECOGNIZING WHICH PARTS OF THEIR IT SYSTEMS COULD MAKE CLAIMS PROCESSING MORE EFFECTIVE. NOW THEY NEED TO GO AHEAD AND CARRY OUT THOSE SYSTEM CHANGES. EDT IS ALSO PRESENTING A MUCH MORE TRANSPARENT PICTURE ON ITS PUBLIC WEBSITE NOW. OF THE CLAIMS BACKLOG DURING THE AUDIT WE FOUND THAT THE CLAIMS BACKLOG NUMBERS ON EDIE'S WEBSITE WE'RE NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE THEY DIDN'T SEPARATE OUT THE CLAIMS THAT WERE BACKLOGGED TO DO DVD DIS IN ACTION. VERSES THOSE WERE EDIE HAD CONTACTED THE CLAIMANT AND WAS NOW WAITING TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTS BACK FROM THE CLAIMANT. THE PUBLIC WEBSITE NOW DOES A MUCH BETTER JOB AT SEGREGATING THOSE TWO POPULATION SO THAT THE PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE CAN HAVE A MUCH BETTER UNDERSTANDING. OF WHAT EDIE'S BACKLOG LOOKS LIKE. I WANT TO FOCUS ON THE DEFERRED WORKLOAD THAT THE STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED A MOMENT AGO SO IT'S TRUE DURING THE PAST THE HEIGHT OF THE PANDEMIC EDT SUSPENDED WORK IN TWO KEY AREAS THAT WE KNOW IN THE AUDIT REPORT. THEY STOPPED MAKING ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS VIRTUALLY ALL OF THEM. AND STAY FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME STOPPED RECEIVING THESE REGULAR ONGOING CERTIFICATIONS OF CONTINUED ELIGIBILITY. DOES REPRESENT AN ENORMOUS BACKLOG OF WORK THE EDT NOW NEDS TO PROCESS AND SO WE MADE SEVERAL RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT HOW IT COULD DO SO. THE ENCOURAGING THINGS THAT IT'S ALREADY DONE TO IMPLEMENT OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FIRST IT'S COMPLETED A RISK ASSESSMENT OF THAT DEFERRED BACKLOG SO WE WANTED THEM TO GO THROUGH AND IDENTIFY AMONGST ALL OF THE DEFERRED WORK WHAT IS THE HIGHEST RISK FOR POTENTIALLY HAVING BEEN OVERPAID OR IMPROPERLY PAID. SO WHEN YOU'RE NOT DOING ELIGIBILITY TO HER DETERMINATIONS YOU COULD POTENTIALLY PAY SOMEBODY WHO'S NOT ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE. BENEFITS OR MAYBE NOT FOR ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT THEY WERE. PROVIDED SO EATING FIRST IN ORDER TO PROCESS THIS ENORMOUS BACKLOG NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS THE HIGHEST RISK WORK IN THE BACKLOG THEY'VE DONE THAT NOW THEY HAVE. THAT RISK ASSESSMENT COMPLETED. THEN THEY'VE GONE AHEAD AND ALSO DEVELOPED A WORKLOAD PLAN FOR HOW TO PROGRESS THROUGH THAT WORKLOAD. SO NOW THEY HAVE DEVELOPED A TIMELINE BY WHICH THEY EXPECTS TO PROGRESS THROUGH THAT WORK. IT CONTRACTED OUT FOR ASSISTANCE TO COMPLETE THAT WORK AS WELL AS OTHER ON GOING HIGHER THAN NORMAL WORKLOADS THAT THEY'RE FACING. THE BIGGEST AREA OF RISK NOW REMAINS THAT EDIE HAS TO ACTUALLY EXECUTE THAT WORKLOAD PLAN SO WE'LL BE CONTINUING TO FOLLOW UP WITH THEM TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY STAY ON SCHEDULE. THERE IS A WINDOW WITHIN WHICH EDT HAS. TIME TO RECOUP IMPROPER PAYMENTS TO REQUEST REPAYMENT OF FUNDS THAT SHOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PAID. BUT THAT WINDOW WILL EVENTUALLY CLOSE AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT EDT COMPLETE ITS- ASSESSMENT AND CONDUCTING OF THIS BACKLOG WORK. BEFORE THAT WINDOW CLOSES THEIR WORK LOT LOAD PLAN RIGHT NOW HAS THEM SCHEDULED TO DO SO. NOW WE NEED TO SEE THEM CARRIED OUT THAT WORKLOAD PLAN. SO THAT'S CLAIMS PROCESSING ON THE SECOND PAGE OF THE HANDOUT WE'LL TALK ABOUT THE CALL CENTER. AND THE THINGS THAT EDT IS DONE TO IMPROVE ITS- ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS CALL CENTER EFFECTIVELY. IT HAS ADDED THOSE CONVENIENCE FEATURES THAT WERE LACKING WHEN IT. ADOPTED A NEW CALL CENTER SYSTEM. SO IT IS ADDED THE PRE RECORDED MESSAGES IF IT'S ADDED THE ABILITY TO RECEIVE A CALL BACK- INSTEAD OF WAITING ON HOLD SO THOSE ARE POSITIVE CONSUMER FACING. IMPROVEMENTS THAT HELP THE EXPERIENCE B. JUST SLIGHTLY BETTER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE CALLING FOR ASSISTANCE. IN ADDITION EDT HAS AT LEAST ADOPTED THE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES NEEDED. TO PROPERLY ASSESS ITS CALL CENTRE WORKLOAD SO THAT IT CAN BETTER ASSIST CLAIMANTS THROUGH NON CALL CENTER OPTIONS. KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE A SUCCESSFULLY HELPING PEOPLE WHO DO YOU CALL THEM. THE FIRST TIME THEY CALL. WHAT'S IMPORTANT NOW THOUGH IS THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE ONLY AS GOOD AS CARRYING THEM OUT SO WE'LL SEE TOWARDS THE BOTTOM OF PAGE TO. THE AREAS WERE STILL ASSESSING IS PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ARE PENDING IMPLEMENTATION ARE THE AREAS OF REGULARLY REVIEWING THE DATA THAT THEY ARE NOW ABLE TO COLLECT. WHEN EDIE DOES CONDUCT REGULAR REVIEWS OF THIS DATA ARE THEY ASSISTING CLAIMANTS THE FIRST TIME I CALL WATER CLAIMANTS CALLING ABOUT. THAT WHAT OTHER CLAIMANTS CALLING ABOUT DATA WILL HELP THEM DO TWO THINGS IT WILL HELP THEM BETTER TRAIN CALL CENTER AGENTS ON THE MOST COMMONLY REQUESTED ITEMS FOR ASSISTANCE. AND THAT IT WILL ALSO HELP THEM PROVIDE THOSE NON CALL CENTER SERVICE OPTIONS. TO SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO CALL THE CALL CENTER THEY CAN HELP THEMSELVES THROUGH EDIE'S WEBSITE. THAT'LL HELP CLAIMANTS RECEIVE MORE TIMELY ASSISTANCE IT'LL ALSO REDUCE THE VOLUME OF PEOPLE CALLING EDIE'S CALL CENTER. SO IMPORTANT FIRST STEPS HERE IN THE AREA OF THE CALL CENTER BUT EDIE NOW HAS TO CONDUCT THIS REGULAR DATA REVIEW AND USE IT TO ACTUALLY IMPROVE THEIR OPERATIONS. AND THEN LASTLY ON THE THIRD PAGE THE AREA FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION. AGAIN GOOD EARLY FIRST STEPS FROM EDT THEY'VE IMPROVED THEIR COORDINATION WITH BANK OF AMERICA THEY HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE WAY OF REVIEWING THE ACCOUNT ACTIVITY NOW WHICH ACCOUNTS ARE FROZEN WHICH ACCOUNTS ARE BEING UNFROZEN WHY ARE THOSE ACCOUNTS BEING FROZEN OR UNFROZEN THEIR SYSTEMS FOR TRACKING ALL THAT INFORMATION ARE IMPROVED SINCE THE TIME WE WERE DOING OUR AUDIT. THEY'VE ALSO PROVIDED CLEAR INFORMATION ON THEIR WEBSITE. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHOSE IDENTITIES WERE STOLEN HOW TO RESOLVE THEIR PENDING TAX LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF THAT. SOME OF THESE BENEFITS ARE TAXABLE BENEFITS. IF YOUR IDENTITY WAS STOLEN AND YOU NEVER ACTUALLY RECEIVE THEM YOU MAY BE FACING A TAX LIABILITY THAT YOU DON'T ACTUALLY. OWN EDIE'S PROVIDED CLEAR INSTRUCTIONS NOW ABOUT HOW TO CONTACT THEM AND GET YOUR ISSUE RESOLVED SO GRAND REALLY GOOD FIRST STEPS. WITH RESPECT TO FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION I WANT TO FOCUS ON TWO AREAS ONE IS THE CREATION OF A FRAUD UNIT AS THE STATE AUDITOR MENTIONED. A MOMENT AGO WHEN WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT EDIE'S FRAUD PREVENTION APPROACHES A PATCHWORK PATCHWORK APPROACH. IT WAS DEPENDED ON SIX DIFFERENT UNITS WITH A NEEDY ALL COORDINATING EFFECTIVELY WITH ONE ANOTHER SO WE RECOMMENDED THEY CREATE A FRAUD UNIT TO CENTRALIZE. THAT VIEW OF FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION. AND THIS IS ACTUALLY IN LINE WITH FRAUD PREVENTION BEST PRACTICES SO THAT UNIT NEEDS TO BE TASKED WITH THE RIGHT. RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEN ENABLED WITH THE RIGHT AUTHORITIES. THE GOD NEWS IS EDT IS DONE THAT THEY HAVE CREATED THAT UNIT. THEY HAVE TASKED IT WITH THE RIGHT RESPONSIBILITIES AND THEY HAVE ASSIGNED AT THE PROPER AUTHORITY WHATWE'RE WAITING ON NOW IS THE FOR THAT UNIT TO BE FULLY STAFFED. THEY ARE RECRUITING THE MISTER HARRIS THAT OR YOU CONTINUE ON THIS IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND IMPACTFUL IS THERE A WAY THAT- SOME FOLKS CAN ACCESS THIS DOCUMENT ONLINE IS AVAILABLE ON YOUR WEBSITE. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS THIS DOCUMENT THE STOCK. WE CAN MAKE IT AVAILABLE IT IS NOT ON THE WEBSITE RIGHT NOW ALL OF THE INFORMATION ABOUT EACH RECOMMENDATION IS ON THE WEBSITE BUT NOT IN THIS FORMAT. SO THE RECOMMENDATION STATUS IS ON THE WEBSITE THIS FORMAT WE CAN ABSOLUTELY MAKE IT AVAILABLE. OKAY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND OTHERS HAVE ACCESS TO THE STOCK MINUTES HERE READING THROUGH IT. OKAY THANK YOU ALL WRAP UP SO EDIE'S FRAUD UNIT GOOD FOR STEPS WE JUST NEED TO SEE THEM STAFF THE UNIT THEY'VE BEEN RECRUITING FOR THAT UNIT THEY JUST NEED TO FILL THE POSITIONS NOW AND THAT WILL HAVE BEEN A FULLY IMPLEMENTED RECOMMENDATION ONCE THEY DO SO. LASTLY ASSESSING WHICH FRAUD PREVENTION AND DETECTION TOOLS ARE EFFECTIVE VERSUS THOSE THAT ARE NOT YOU'LL SEE IN THE HAND OUT THIS IS UNDER THE MAY TWENTY TWENTY ONE HEADING THIS IS A FULLY IMPLEMENTED RECOMMENDATION THE REASON FOR THAT IS EDT NOW HAS A ROBUST PLAN FOR HOW IT WILL ASSESS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS TOOLS AND THEY SHOWED US EARLY SIGNS THAT THEY ARE IN FACT CARRYING THAT PLAN OUT. THEY JUST STARTED SO THIS IS ANOTHER AREA WHERE THEY'RE GONNA NEED TO CONTINUE TO SUSTAIN THE EARLY PROGRESS THAT THEY'VE MADE AND THIS IS NOW A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT AS WELL. BILL COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. LAST JULY. A DOCTOR THIS IS A STATUTORY REQUIREMENT EDT HAS TO REPORT BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE REGULARLY ABOUT ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS SO THERE'S STATUTORY ACCOUNTABILITY NOW EDT NEEDS TO FOLLOW THROUGH WITH ITS ASSESSMENTS- AND WILL KEEP TABS ON THEM FOR THAT AS WELL. THAT'S THE CONCLUSION OF MY SUMMARY BUT I BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS MEMBERS MIGHT HAVE ABOUT. THESE RECOMMENDATIONS OR THE STATUS. OF THEM RIGHT NOW. JACKIE YEAH YOU YOU INDICATED THAT THE HIDEOUS IN THE FORMATION OF CREATING THIS OF FRAUD UNIT AND THAT THEY'VE FORMULATED IT IS OR ANY PROJECTION AS TO WHEN THEY MAY BE. STAFFING THIS UNIT. I WOULD DEFERRED EDT ON WHEN THEY EXPECT TO BE FULLY STAFFED I KNOW WE'VE SEEN RECRUITMENT EFFORTS THEY'VE ADVERTISED POSITIONS- FOR THAT UNIT SO- AND IT'S- THERE ARE PARTIAL STAFFING IT'S JUST NOT. CLOSE TO FULL STAFFING YET. OKAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THAT. THANK YOU FOR THAT OVERVIEW AND UPDATE- I THINK IT'S IT IS GOOD TO HEAR THAT THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS IS MADE ON MANY OF YOUR HOT SPOT ON RECOMMENDATIONS. DOES SEEM LIKE THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT WORK REMAINING AND THAT. IN SUMMARY THAT THERE THE PLANS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT STILL NEED TO BE OPERATIONALIZED. BOB HAS THE PACE IF THEY'RE PART OF PROGRESS FELT. FAST SLOWER WHAT YOU WOULD HAVE EXPECTED. WELL WE'VE WE'VE PLACED AND IT'S IN THE DOCUMENT BUT EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS HAD EXPECTED TIME FRAMES WITHIN WHICH WE WANTED THEM TO ACCOMPLISH THESE TASKS EDT APPEARS TO HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING THOSE TIMELINE SO TO THAT END I WOULD SAY. FOR THE MAJORITY OF THESE IT'S BEEN ON PACE WITH WHAT WE ARE EXPECTING THEM TO ACCOMPLISH. I KNOW WE'VE BEEN DOING WE'VE BEEN HAVING HEARINGS FOR. GOSH ABOUT SIXTEEN MONTHS SO IT CAN OFTEN SEEM FRUSTRATINGLY SLOW- FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT IN THESE THINGS BUT- GOOD TO HEAR THAT THERE IS ON TRACK WITH THE PROJECT PLAN THAT YOU SET OUT. AND APPLE I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU- THIS HALL AS YOU WALK THROUGH KIND OF THAT THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE ON IT HE YOU POINTED OUT WHICH BUT CENTER LAYERED IN WITH MANY OF US HAVE THAT MANY OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THINGS THAT. WERE IDENTIFIED. TEN YEARS AGO FIVE YEARS AGO TWO YEARS AGO. WHAT AT ITS WHAT ADVICE WOULD OU LEAVE US WITH TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT SITTING HERE AGAIN TEN YEARS FROM NOW HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY FOLLOW THROUGH AND ACTUALLY IMPLEMENT THE CHANGES THAT ARE GOING TO ENSURE THAT THAT THAT THIS IS THE LAST TIME WE DEAL WITH THIS FIASCO. WELL I WAS GOING TO FALL ON THE ANSWER MISTER HARRIS IS GAVE IN AND THE DISCUSSION YOU JUST SIXTEEN MONTHS OF HEARINGS THE LEGISLATURE WHAT WHAT MY OFFICE HAS BEEN DOING MORE AND MORE IN THE LAST FEW YEARS IS FOCUSING ON MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE. BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE IT AT THE STATE AUDITOR DOES NOT HAVE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WE CAN'T FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION TO DO CERTAIN THINGS BUT CERTAINLY WE CAN PARTNER WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE STRONG OVERSIGHT TO GIVE YOU THE INFORMATION YOU NEED. TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT WE NEED TO PUT THIS IN STATUTE AND IT'S NOT JUST EIGHTY IT'S OTHER STATE DEPARTMENTS IF THEY HAVE SOMETHING IN STATURE THAT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO DO THEIR MUCH MORE INCLINED TO DO IT THEN IF THE STATE AUDITOR TELLS AND TO DO IT NOW I. EIGHTY I THINK AND THERE ARE DISCUSSIONS WITH THEM OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST YEAR OR TEN MONTHS THAT WE'VE BEEN AFTER WE ISSUED THE REPORT HAS BEEN VERY RESPONSIVE TO A LOT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT WE MADE SOME OF THE PROGRESS. HAS BEEN SLOWER THAN WE WOULD LIKE AS AS MR HARRIS SAID. SOME OF IT'S ON PACE SOME OF IT IS A LITTLE TOO SLOW. LIKE WE'RE EXPECTING SOME THINGS AND JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT YOU HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE SOME OF THAT IS I. T. THEY HAVE A LEGACY SYSTEM MOST. WORKFORCE DATA SYSTEMS ACROSS THE COUNTRY OUR LEGACY SYSTEMS SO WE HAVE TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT AND TRY TO IMPROVE THAT. BUT MY THOUGHTS OR MY OBSERVATION IS. I THINK. STRONG LEGISLATIVE OVERSIGHT WHICH WE HAVE SEEN IN THE LAST YEAR AND A HALF. AND A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN MY OFFICE AND THE LEGISLATURE AND MAKING SURE THAT IF THERE ARE THINGS WE THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. YOU KNOW AN ACT TO TRY TO. TRY TO GET INTO STATE LAW. IT WILL COMPEL A DEPARTMENT LIKE ANY DAY AND SOME OF THE OTHER DEPARTMENTS THAT WE OUGHT IT. TO ACTUALLY DO THINGS THE OTHER THING IS OUR FOLLOW UP PROCESS AND HAVING THESE KINDS OF HEARINGS WHERE. THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS I MEAN THAT THEY WERE CONTACTING MISTER HARRIS. ON THURSDAY I MET WITH HIM BEFORE I WORK FROM HOME ON FRIDAY AND HE WAS. CALLING ON FRIDAY EDIE'S TRYING TO STILL GET ME SOME INFORMATION BECAUSE THEY KNEW. THIS HEARING WAS HAPPENING AND THEY WANTED US TO BE ABLE TO SAY. YEAH THEY'VE MADE PROGRESS AS FAR AS PUTTING A PLAN TOGETHER PUTTING THAT WERE- THAT FRIED UNIT TOGETHER THEY'RE STARTING TO STAFF A UNIT. SO I THINK PERSISTENT OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW IT'S A LOT OF WORK BECAUSE YOU HAVE A LOT OF RESPONSIBILITIES. BUT PERSISTENT OVER STATE BY THE LEGISLATURE BY THE VARIOUS COMMITTEES. AND CERTAINLY PUTTING THINGS INTO STATE LAW. AND THEN USING THIS OFFICE. LONG AFTER I'M GONE THIS OFFICE IS GOING TO BE FINE. I'M GONNA MISS IT I'M HONORED TO HAVE SERVED AS LONG AS I DID- BUT I THINK THAT PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE THE TALENTED STAFF THAT THAT THE OFFICE HAS. WILL WILL ALLOW YOU TO YOU AS MEMBERS TO CONTINUE TO STAY ON TOP OF THIS ISSUE. AND OTHER ISSUES THAT THAT CALIFORNIA FACES. THANK YOU FOR THAT WE VALUE YOUR PARTNERSHIP AS WELL. WELL WE CAN CELEBRATE YOUR RETIREMENT I'M NOT SURE I'M READY TO. HAVE I'M NOT READY TO THERE JUST YET INSTITUTIONAL KNOWLEDGE ON EDT AND THE FRAMEWORK THAT IT'S TAKEN US TO GET HERE I THINK IT'S SO INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT I'M SURE WE'LL WE'RE GONNA BE RELYING ON YOU EVEN. AFTER YOU YOUR HOPES ARE MEANT I'M NOT ANYWHERE AND I WOULD JUST SAY- MISTER HARRIS WHEN YOU GET A MOMENT OR WHEN YOUR OFFICE GETS A MOMENT IF YOU CAN SEND IT IS VERY- FOUR SHEETS OF COMPREHENSIVE DATA. TO MICHAEL ON ON BUDGET STAFF SO THAT WE CAN PUT IT UP ON THE WEBSITE AS WELL THAT WOULD BE. INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AS THERE'S FOLKS CURRENTLY RIGHT NOW IN IN REAL TIME ASKING ASKING FOR THE INFORMATION SO AS. SOON AS YOU CAN PLEASE LET US KNOW. SALAS MARK. THANK YOU CHAIR- AND MY- AT AGREE MORE YOU PER ACCOUNTABLE IT'S A MAY THAT ONE WE SET A HEARING HOW MUCH WORK GETS DONE RIGHT BEFORE THE HEARING SO THAT THEY HAVE SOMETHING TO REPORT ON SO I WANTED TO DELVE INTO SOMETHING THAT YOU AND MR HER SEXUALLY TOUCHED UPON- YOU KNOW THE REPORT CONCLUDED THAT EDIE'S FAILURE TO PLAN FOR RECESSION HINDERED ITS RESPONSE TO THE SURGEON CLAIMS. SO THE REPORT RECOMMENDED THE EDT MEDIALLY BEGIN MODELING WORK FLOW PROJECTIONS AND DEVELOP STAFFING PLANS AROUND CERTAIN SCENARIOS GIVEN THE CYCLICAL NATURE THAT YOU BOTH SPOKE ABOUT THE ECONOMY AND UNEMPLOYMENT HE DOES A LITTLE PERPLEXED TO THE EDT DIDN'T ALREADY HAVE PLANS FOR DEALING WITH THE ECONOMIC DOWN TERMS OF SPIKES IN UNEMPLOYMENT. SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT EDT IS PROVIDED YOU IN TERMS OF WORKLOAD PROJECTIONS AND STAFFING PLANS IN THE AND IF YOU COULD SPEAK TO THE QUALITY AND POTENTIAL EFFECTIVENESS OF ANY NEW WORKLOAD OUR STAFFING PLANS TO ADDRESS A LOT OF THESE ISSUES I KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT AT A AT A BIG LEVEL BUT I'M JUST WONDERING HAVE YOU ACTUALLY SEEN THEM PUT TEAMS TOGETHER- YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR LIKES TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW A STRIKE TEAM FOR INSTANCE HAVE YOU SEEN THAT APPLE DEPARTMENT. TO START WORKING THROUGH THESE ISSUES. SO WE'VE ONLY SEEN THAT APART CLAIM THAT IT'S WERE ON THIS THEY'VE NOT THEY'VE NOT CLAIMS TO US THAT THEY ARE DONE IN THIS AREA- THE DEPARTMENTS TALK TO US ABOUT. FORMING A WORKLOAD FORECASTING UNIT AND WORKING WITH A CONTRACTOR TO TRY AND DEVELOP WHAT THEY CALL WHAT IF SCENARIOS- TO PREDICT ITS WORKLOAD- BUT CERTAINLY THIS IS ONE WHERE WE'RE WE'RE NOT SAYING THEY'RE EVEN PARTIALLY DONE YET THIS IS A PENDING RECOMMENDATION AND WE'VE ONLY SEEN VERY. EARLY STATEMENTS FROM THE DEPARTMENT ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO ADDRESS THAT PROBLEM. GOT IT BUT YOU HAVEN'T SEEN ANY WORKPLACE TEAMS OR MANAGERS BEING ASSIGNED TO ACTUALLY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. SO THE DEPARTMENTS CLAIMING THAT WE WERE JUST NOT SEEN THE DOCUMENTATION AT. OKAY ALL RIGHT THAT'S QUESTION WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THE NEXT PANEL ON DVD THAT. I WANTED TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION IF I COULD YOU KNOW THE OTHER. REPORT PROVIDED A LITANY OF GREAT RECOMMENDATIONS YOU KNOW AND THAT APPROVING EASY THESE EFFORTS. TO PROCESS CLAIMS MANAGE WORKLOAD AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE. AT THE CALL CENTERS. BUT JUST THRESHOLD OVERALL ON A SCALE OF ONE TO TEN YOU KNOW ONE BEING AWFUL TEN BEING GREAT FOR I WOULD JUST SAY EDIE'S PERFORMANCES. IN IMPLEMENTING THESE RECOMMENDATIONS RIGHT NOW. SO AGAIN THEY'VE THEY'VE STAYED MOSTLY NOT ENTIRELY ON SCHEDULE WITH THE ROAD MAP THAT WE LAID OUT FOR THEM- CERTAINLY. CONTINUED. THIS LEGISLATIVE HEARINGS IN THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE ATTENTION THAT'S BEEN BROUGHT TO THEM OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS. SHE LAST FEW MONTHS. OKAY AND I WAS JUST TRYING TO DO THE MATH AND I THINK. BASED OFF OF WHAT YOU PROVIDED- YOU KNOW. THE COMMITTEE HERE TODAY YOU KNOW THIRTEEN OUT OF TWENTY ONE THAT'S LIKE 62% OF IT ACTUALLY BEING DONE. IS THAT CORRECT. THAT SOUNDS ABOUT RIGHT I HAVEN'T I HAVEN'T DONE THAT SPECIFIC NOW BUT YES OKAY ALL RIGHT AND I WANTED TO ASK ANOTHER QUESTION WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED UPON IT TOO MUCH BUT I KNOW MY OFFICES RECEIVE CALLS YOU DON'T ADDITION TO HELPING PEOPLE PROCESS THEIR CLAIMS THROUGH EDT. BUT ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS THAT- PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CALLING ABOUT IT WE'VE BEEN ASSISTING TO IS THE UTILITIES BENEFITS. SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT RIGHT JUST BCAUSE THEY BUT FOLLOWING UP UNDER THAT YOU AYE. SO IT'S ONE OF ASK AND YOU KNOW IT WHAT LET ME JUST LET ME FRAME IT THE RIGHT WAY SO OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT PERTAINS TO EDIE'S BENEFIT SYSTEMS MODERNIZATION PROJECT WHICH IS A PROJECT TO MODERNIZE EDIE'S YOU WHY AND OTHER BENEFITS SYSTEMS. THIS PROJECT BEGAN IN TWENTY SIXTEEN BUT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR AND THE OTHER REPORT YOU THOUGHT EDT BY JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE SHOULD AT LEAST IDENTIFY THE ELEMENTS OF THE OF THE BENEFITS SYSTEM MODERNIZATION PROJECT THAT CAN ASSIST DVD AND MAKING TIMELY PAYMENTS AND CAN BE IMPLEMENTED. INCREMENTALLY AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDED ELEVEN POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS TDD TO REFOCUS ON THIS PROJECT AND I BELIEVE THE EDT HAS IMPLEMENTED THIS RECOGNITION WE HAVE ALLOCATED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO HELP SO COULD YOU PLEASE JUST TRY TO SUMMARIZE WHAT INCREMENTAL MODIFICATIONS EDT HAS IDENTIFIED OR IMPLEMENTED TO IMPROVE ITS CLAIMS PROCESS. AND THAT JUST KIND OF THE IMPACTS THAT THAT'S GOING TO HAVE. SO IT WE HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU. WITH THE INFORMATION ABOUT THE SPECIFIC AREAS THAT EDIE'S IDENTIFY CAN BE AND INCREMENTALLY IMPLEMENTED BUT THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED THE PORTIONS OF THE B. S. M. PROJECT. THAT THEY CAN IMPLEMENT INCREMENTALLY THAT WOULD PROVIDE MORE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO FOLKS- IN GETTING THEIR CLAIMS PROCESS BUT TO THE SPECIFIC AREAS AND THERE WERE SIX OF THEM THAT THEY IDENTIFIED- THAT THEY COULD IMPLEMENT IN A MORE TIMELY FASHION WE'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU WITH THAT INFORMATION- ALL RIGHT THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT IT'S STILL WITH THE LEGISLATURE ALLOCATES RESOURCES FOR THIS YEAR WE EXPECT TO SEE RESULTS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SALAS. IN MY OPENING REMARKS I MENTIONED THAT WE HAD THE LEGISLATURE HAD. ALLOCATED A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR. ADDITIONAL STAFFING AND A TOTAL OF. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD BACKLOG. BUT AUDITOR HOW YOU MENTIONED BRIEFLY AND ISSUE RELATED TO I. T. AND TECHNOLOGY TESE LEGACY. OF PROGRAMS THAT DON'T FUNCTION IN TODAY'S SOCIETY. I'M CURIOUS IF- YOU CAN SHARE. TIMELINE IN TERMS OF WHAT WILL IT TAKE TO IN MANY WAYS. TURN THIS TITANIC AROUND- AND REALLY IMPROVE THE TECHNOLOGY WITHIN EDT. SO THAT WE HAVE A MORE MODERN SYSTEM THAT CAN REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE NEEDS OF THE STATE- I KNOW IT CAN'T HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. BUT I REALLY DO BELIEVE THAT WE NEED TO SET GOALS AND WE NEED TO MEET THOSE GOALS. IN ORDER FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO SHIFT AND REALLY TO BE ABLE TO ENSURE THAT THE SAFETY NET. THAT REALLY SHOULD JUST BE A FUNCTIONING SAFETY NET. DOESN'T HAVE PEOPLE FALLING THROUGH IT BECAUSE OF THESE GAPING HOLES WITHIN THE SAFETY NET AND A LARGE PART OF THAT. IS SIMPLY NO MATTER HOW MANY PEOPLE WE PUT BEHIND IT HOW MANY PEOPLE WE HIRE. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TRAINED. TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SIX POINT THREE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT AND HIRING PEOPLE. WHAT'S THE USE IF THE SYSTEM IS SO SLOW. THAT IT CAN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT A NEW WORK FORCE OR THE NEED FROM PEOPLE REQUIRING ASSISTANCE FROM EDT. MISTER HARRIS CAN ASSIST ME WITH THIS BUT AS HE JUST INDICATED THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AN INCREMENTAL APPROACH. SO ONE OF ONE OF BASED ON MY EXPERIENCE AS THE AUDITOR AND LOOKING AT A LOT OF I. T. PROJECTS IN CALIFORNIA OBVIOUSLY. THE SYSTEM'S EDT SYSTEM IS HUGE AND THEY NEED TO DO T INCREMENTALLY SO I THINK WHAT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A TIME FRAME BECAUSE WE WOULD NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE INCREMENTS THAT THEY'VE IDENTIFIED THAT ARE. CRITICAL MISSION CRITICAL- SO WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHEN WE LOOK AT DEPARTMENTS THAT WANT TO UNDERTAKE AND I. T. PROJECT EITHER DESIGNING A NEW PROJECT OR IMPLEMENTING CHANGES TO AN EXISTING PROJECT. IS SCOPE CREEP SO YOU MADE USE ME YOU MAY SAID WE'RE GOING TO DO AN INCOME AND CROWN- PROSTATE WE'RE GONNA USE AN INCREMENTAL PROCESS WHICH THE DEPARTMENT TECHNOLOGY- ADVISES START SHOULD PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO EDT- BUT WHAT WE HAVE TENDED TO SEE IS HERE ARE MISSION CRITICAL THINGS THAT WE NEED TO FIX AN EDT SYSTEM. BUT THEN THE VENDOR GETS IN ITS AS WELL WOULD BE NICE TO HAVE THIS NICE TO HAVE THAT NICE TO HAVE THAT THEN YOU GET THE SCOPE CREEP NOW YOUR YEARS AND YEARS AWAY FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. THE MISSION CRITICAL ARE CHANGES THAT WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ACCESSING THE SYSTEM SO WHAT I BELIEVE SHOULD HAPPEN IS. EDT IDENTIFYING THIS INCREMENTAL APPROACH AND THEN SETTING TIMELINES WHAT ARE THE SPECIFIC TIMELINES FOR US BEING ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE MISSION CRITICAL CHANGES TO THE SYSTEM AND LET'S HOLD ON TO THAT AND NOT ALLOW ANY SCOPE CREEP- THOSE ARE NICE TO HAVES AND WE CAN DO THAT DOWN THE ROAD BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA GET MONEY TO DO THAT UNTIL YOU ACCOMPLISH THIS. BECAUSE THESE ARE THE THINGS THAT YOU AS THE AGENCY AND WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT ACKNOWLEDGE A DETERMINED ARE THE THINGS THAT NEED TO BE IMPROVED MODERNIZE ETCETERA LET'S MAKE SURE THAT GETS DONE SO I THINK THE LEGISLATURE WOULD BE ABLE TO. PROVIDE OVERSIGHT. BUT ALSO HOLD ON YOU KNOW THE PERSON BRING JUST. WE GET YOU MONEY DO THESE THINGS. YOU NEED TO GET THOSE THINGS DONE BEFORE WE'RE WILLING TO. PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND MISTER SALAS TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION RELATED TO- SOME OF THE WORKLOAD STAFFING AND PLANNING THOSE ARE AREAS THAT WE FELT AS WE SAY ON THIS HANDOUT. THEY NEED TO DO THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE REPORT. YOU KNOW I MEAN YOU'VE BEEN PROCESSING UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS FOR DECADES YOU KNOW WHAT YOU NEED TO DO TO PROCESS CLAIMS SO. AS WE HAVE ON HERE WERE SAYING PENDING WHICH MEANS THEY HAVEN'T MADE MUCH PROGRESS SO. IF THAT'S AN AREA THAT I WOULD FOCUS ON I WOULD BE DISAPPOINTED IN THEIR PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THEY NEED TO PUT THAT WORKLOAD PLAN TOGETHER. AND PROJECTIONS BECAUSE- HOW DO YOU DETERMINE HOW MANY STAFF YOU WANNA HIRE HOW DO YOU DETERMINE HOW MUCH MONEY YOU NEED THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE. SO THAT WE CAN HIRE THE APPROPRIATE STAFF WHAT KIND OF TRAINING DO WE NEED TO PROVIDE TO THESE FOLKS IF WE'RE GOING TO MODERNIZE THE SYSTEM. WHAT KIND OF TRAINING TO OUR STAFF NEED TO YOU TO HAVE TO BE ABLE TO USE THAT SYSTEM AS EFFICIENTLY AS POSSIBLE SO. THEY HAVE MADE PROGRESS IN YOUR RIGHT IT'S ABOUT SIXTY FIVE PERCENT- IT THIRTEEN OUT OF TWENTY ONE- SO BUT BUT AREAS AS FAR AS PLANNING PROJECTIONS ANALYSIS. IS WHERE IN SOME AREAS THEY'VE DONE WELL IN SOME AREAS THEY HAVE DONE HAVE NOT DONE AS WELL- AND THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE FELT THEY NEEDED TO ADDRESS IMMEDIATELY AND- YOU KNOW HERE WE ARE IT'S OCTOBER. SO HOPEFULLY THAT ANSWERED BOTH BOTH YOUR QUESTIONS MEMBERS. THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS FIFTY TWO NORTH. I KNOW IN YOUR AD JANUARY AUDIT YOU HAD A ESTIMATE OF FRAUD THAT WAS I THINK TEN POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS HAVE YOU REVISED THAT ESTIMATE. NOW WE'VE NOT THAT'S THE ESTIMATE AT THE TIME WE COMPLETED THE AUDIT WOULD NOT COME BACK TO REVISE THAT. IF YOU HAVEN'T LOOKED AT THE DIFFERENT TACK INTO. REFINING THEM NO ALTHOUGH EDT ITSELF AROUND THE SAME TIME WE PUBLISH THE AUDIT- ESTIMATED THAT IT COULD BE AS MUCH AS THIRTY BILLION BUT NOW WE HAVE NOT COME UP WITH A SEPARATE. CHECK INTO THAT WITH OUR NEXT PANELIST. OKAY IF THERE ARE NO ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS AND FOR YOUR TESTIMONY TODAY WE WILL MOVE ON TOWARDS ADAM PANEL NUMBER TWO. THANK YOU. MUCH OF IT SHOULD BE PERFECT FOR ME I JUST GOT IT OKAY WE HAVE FOR THOSE OF YOU WATCHING ONLINE WE HAVE RECEIVED THE FOUR PAGE DOCUMENT- PROVIDED BY THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE AND THAT SHOULD BE UP ON OUR WEBSITE VERY SHORTLY IF YOU'RE WATCHING ONLINE AND WANT TO SEE IT SHOULD BE A VERY SOON. ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA START WITH OUR PRESENTATION FOR A PANEL NUMBER TWO IF WE HAVE DIRECTOR OF EDT DIRECTOR SIGNS ONLINE. AS WELL AS THE REST OF HER STAFF AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. MORE GLOBAL INTRODUCED THAT STAFF AS WE GO ALONG AS WELL AS ALEJO. CHARACTER SIGNED GOOD AFTERNOON. REMEMBERS CHAIRS ONE CHER APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. I AM I AM BY THE DISCUSSIONS AND REPORT OF THE LEGISLATOR- AUDITOR DAHLE. STATE AUDITOR AND THE REASON FOR THAT IS THAT ALL RIGHT TO WHO- WAS OUT AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN- DURING THE TIME OF THE PANDEMIC WELL I CAME TO. BE WITH THE DEPARTMENT IN JANUARY AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE FRUSTRATIONS THE PEOPLE HAVE HAD. FOR WAITING FOR IMPROVEMENTS. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT. A SUBSTANTIAL IS THE AUDITOR STAFF SENATORS SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE HAVE BEEN COMPLETE. APPROXIMATELY 70% ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATION. SO FOR THE RECORD I AM WE JUST SCIENCE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT AND WITH ME TODAY ARE IMAGE AMY FAULKNER WHO IS OUR CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF OPERATIONS. CHRIS YES STATEN OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE BRANCH DEPUTY DIRECTOR KEVIN METALIK CHIEF OF FISCAL PROGRAMS DIVISION EXCUSE ME DEPUTY DIRECTOR FOR LEGISLATIVE AFFAIRS AND WHAT MANY OF YOU HAVE MET HIM AND CALEB CORRAL CHIEF OF THE FISCAL PROGRAMS DIVISION THEY WILL BE AVAILABLE TODAY TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS. SO NOW TO MURRAY. 70% OF THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMPLETE. WE HAVE MET EVERY DEADLINE. AND THOSE REMAINING ARE EITHER NOT YET DO OR THEIR PRIVATE CATERED S. AND HIS. LARGE AS THE AUDITOR STAFF SAID ONE PART COMPLETE AND THE OTHER REQUIRING MONITORING OF A TRUMP. HAVING BEEN IN STATE GOVERNMENT OFTEN KNOWN FOR FORTY YEARS I SAY THAT- MONITORING IS. IS EVERY DEPARTMENT COULD YOU COULD. IT'S A VALUABLE TO EVERY DEPARTMENT- DISTRICT THREE RECOMMENDATIONS ARE 68% PERCENT COMPLETE WE'RE ON TRACK TO REACH 75% BY DECEMBER A 100% OF THE SHORT TERM RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMPLETE A 100% OF THE NEAR TERM RECOMMENDATIONS ARE COMPLETE. AND THE LONG TERM OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE ALL THE TRUCKERS. BEHIND THOSE NUMBERS ARE IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS SOME OF WHICH OF THE STATE ARCHER'S OFFICE AS MENTIONED ALREADY. LAUNCHED LAUNCHED A VIRTUAL CALL BACK FEATURE TO CUT DOWN CLAIMANTSTWO WEEKS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO WAIT ON THE PHONE. WE DEPLOYED OUR IDENTITY VERIFICATION AND FRAUD FILTERS THAT BLOCK A HUNDRED AND TWENTY BILLIONDOLLARS IN FUNCTIONS. WE ELIMINATED THE BACKLOG OF ONE POINT SIX CLAIM ONE POINT SIX CLAIMS MILLION CLAIMS FROM LAST YEAR WHEN WE SET UP THE- WE SET UP A FORM TEN NINETY NINE G. INFORMATION HELPLINE TO HELP CLAIMANTS WITH TAX QUESTIONS REGARDING THE FATHER WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. AND IT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION WE'RE OVERHAULING OUR BENEFITS SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES TO DELIVER SERVICES. FOCUS FIRST ON THE CLAIMANT'S NEEDS. DURING THE PANDEMIC IT BECAME VERY CLEAR THAT WE NEED TO REFOCUS OUR IT MODERNIZATION WHICH HAD BEGUN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC TO BE CLAIMANTS CENTER. A REVIEW OF OUR BENEFIT PROGRAM RULES AND BUSINESS PROCESSES WHICH IS THE FIRST STEP. TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A NEW I. T. SYSTEM HAS BEGUN THIS MONTH AND SOME CHANGES HAVE ALREADY BEEN MADE. I APPRECIATE THE CONTINUED PARTNERSHIP WE'VE HAD WITH THE LEGISLATURE DURING THIS PANDEMIC UNION LEADERSHIP AND ACTIONS WILL HELP US CONTINUE TO MAKE IMPROVEMENTS. BOTH WITH BUDGET ALLOCATIONS AS A CHAIRPERSON MENTIONED AND LEGISLATION. TODAY WE ARE STRONGER MORE EFFICIENT AND HAVE PUT IN PLACE IMPROVEMENTS THAT WILL HAVE LASTING BENEFITS. LEGISLATURE HAS CODIFIED MANY OF THESE KEY IMPROVEMENTS AND A SPECIAL THANKS TO THOSE PRESENT TODAY WHO STEP FORWARD TO DO THAT. MY EMPLOYMENT IN THIS NEW LEGISLATION AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE STRIKE TEAM. AND THE STATE AUDITOR. THIS DEPARTMENT IS BEING TRANSFORMED. WE ARE PAYING BENEFITS FASTER ANYMORE IN IN A MORE SECURE WAY. WE PAID A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN BENEFITS TO MILLIONS OF PEOPLE OVER THE PANDEMIC THAT'S FOUR TIMES AS MUCH AS THE WORST TWO YEARS OF THE GREAT RECESSION COMBINED. WELL FOR FILLING THE CSA AND STRETCHING RECOMMENDATIONS WE IMPLEMENTED MAJOR NEW UNANTICIPATED FEDERAL PROGRAMS.% SINCE JANUARY WE WERE PAYING THREE MILLION PEOPLE. ABOUT ONE POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS PLUS A WEEK. WE HIRED OVER SIX THOUSAND WORKERS DURING THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING MORE THAN THIRTEEN HUNDRED OFFICE TECHNICIANS AND CALL CENTER EXPERTS SINCE MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. WE IMPLEMENTED THE AMERICAN RESCUE PLAN FASTER THAN PROMISED INCLUDING DELIVERING P. YOU SEE BENEFITS FOR SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. IN JUNE WE AUTOMATED THE BENEFIT YEAR RENEWAL. THE BENEFIT YEAR END IN JULY WE INSTITUTED A PAY NOW POLICY TO HELP CLAIMANTS WITH INDIAN CLAIMS THAT HAS EXPEDITED SINCE THAT TIME PAYMENT FOR NEARLY FOUR. HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMS. AT THE END OF THE MOST OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS SEPTEMBER THE FOURTH AUTOMATICALLY EXTENDED AN ADDITIONAL WEEK TO THE FETID PROGRAM FOR THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CLAIMS. WE ALSO PUT A STOP TO THE UNPRECEDENTED LEVELS FRAUD ACTIVITY FROM TWENTY TWENTY WE KNOW HOW THE SYSTEM IS MORE SECURE THAN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. THE MOST IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT TWENTY TWENTY WAS AN ANOMALY. A CRIMINAL ASSAULT ON THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM ACROSS THE COUNTRY. WE CLOSED THE DOOR TO THAT. FRONT LAST YEAR IN A STE NEW FOR PREVENT. MEASURES INCLUDE ID ME THOMPSON WRITERS NEXT. CAN WAS THE FIRST STATE DO THIS. CRIMINAL HAVEN'T GIVEN UP. WE CONTINUE TO AND STRENGTHEN FRAUD FOR TO PREVENT FROM SPEED PAYMENT NOT AFFECT CLAIMANTS BUT AS YOU YOUR OFFICE STAFF KNOW LIKE THEY HAVE BEEN DOING WITH E. G. D. WE HAD A- A NEW WAVE FOR. CLAIMS JUST THE END OF THE FEDERAL PROGRAM SO. WE'RE STILL WORKING ON A TO. ENSURE THAT DATA THOSE KINDS OUR GREAT ARE NOT PAID. WE HAVE BEEN GREAT WE CURRENTLY IN. IN. SEVEN HUNDRED. LOCAL FRAUD CASES ACROSS THE STATE. WE ALSO BROUGHT IN FORMER US ATTORNEY MCGREGOR SCOTT TO HELP US HOLD BROADER FRAUDSTERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS LAST YEAR. GREGOR SCOTT HAS LED NUMEROUS LARGE SCALE CRIMINAL PROBES IN HIS MANY YEARS AS A STATE AND FEDERAL PROSECUTOR. WITH HIS DATE WE ARE IN POWERING MORE PROSECUTORS TO CRACK DOWN ON THOSE WHO ENGAGED IN CRIMINAL ACTIVITY LAST YEAR. WE HAVE ALSO TAKEN STRONG STEPS TO IMPROVE OUR MULTI LINGUAL SERVICE. WITH THE SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATURE WE ARE INVESTING MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INTERPRETER AND TRANSLATION SERVICES. FOR EXAMPLE EDT EXPANDED ITS LANGUAGE LINE CONTRACT INCLUDES FRONTLINE STAFF TO MAXIMIZE ACCESS TO LANGUAGE LINE SERVICES. MAJOR INVESTMENTS ARE ALSO BEING MADE TO EXPAND TRANSLATIONAL VITAL DOCUMENTS INTO MULTIPLE LANGUAGES MANY KEY FORMS HAVE ALREADY BEEN TRANSLATED. OUR CALLS HONOR EXPENDED EXPANDED LANGUAGE LINES HAVE BEEN INCREASING WEEKLY. THE CALL CENTER REMAINS A CHALLENGE. WE RUN THE CALL CENTER TWELVE DAYS OR WEEKS SEARCH TWELVE HOURS A DAY SEVEN DAYS A WEEK ASTRID MORE THAN TEN MILLION CALLS DURING THE PANDEMIC STILL THE LEVEL OF WEEKDAY CALLS STILL OVERWHELMS THE SISTER. IN JULY THERE WERE ABOUT THREE MILLION CALLS A WEEK. IT'S NOW DOWN TO A MILLION BUT LET ME CLARIFY THAT NUMBER BECAUSE PERCENTAGES ARE ALWAYS TAKEN FROM THE LARGEST NUMBER. THAT NUMBER REPRESENTS A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND FORTY UNIQUE COLORS LAST WEEK. THE STAFF ANSWERED A HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWO OF THOSE CALLS WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 95% OF THE CALLS. THE REST WERE REPEAT CALLS OR ROBOCALLS THE AVERAGE SPEED IN ANSWERING HAS IMPROVED NOW TO EIGHTEEN MINUTES THE CALL THE ALL VALUE ON WEEKENDS AND IN THE EVENINGS HAS DROPPED SUBSTANTIALLY. WE ARE IMPROVING IMPROVING SERVICE QUALITY SO THAT WE CAN RESULT CALLER ISSUES THE FIRST TIME. THIS IS AN IMPROVEMENT BUT THE OBO CALLS AND THE REPEAT CALLS CAN STILL OVERWHELM THE SYSTEM DURING THE WEEK DAYS. THE FEDERAL PROGRAMS OVER WE SEE LESS CALL STRUCTURE TRAFFIC IN THE EVENINGS AND THE WEEKENDS. MEANWHILE THE PAPERWORK WE NEED TO COMPLETE TO GET PEOPLE PAID REMAINS. SO WE ARE EXPLORING WAYS TO BE ABLE TO REJECT REDIRECT THE EVENING AND WEEKEND RESOURCES SO THAT WE CAN PAY PEOPLE EVEN FASTER. WELL WE'RE CHANGING POLICIES AND AUTOMATING. THINGS ARE NOT IMPROVING FAST ENOUGH FOR SOME. THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES AHEAD. DETERMINATION INTERVIEWS AS I MENTIONED WE LARGE TO PAY NO POLICY IN JULY TO GET FUNDS TO CONTINUE CLAIMS- PASTOR FRAUD FILTERS AND WE'RE WAITING MORE THAN CHAU TWO WEEKS FOR PAYMENT. WE HAVE PAID SINCE THEN NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CLAIMS UNDER THIS CHANGE IN POLICY. SOME OF THOSE CLAIMANTS ARE WAITING FOR DETERMINATION INTERVIEWS BUT THEY ARE BEING PAID. WELL CONTINUED CLAIMANTS ARE NOW PAID WORK FOR DETERMINATION ELIGIBILITY REMAINS FOR EXAMPLE. CLAIM WAGE INFORMATION. EMPLOYER PROVIDED MAY CONFLICT WITH WHAT THE CLAIMANT PROVIDED OR WE NEED TO ESTABLISH WHY A PERSON LEFT A JOB WHEN THEY QUIT OR WERE FIRED THESE KEY ISSUES REQUIRING INTERVIEWING THE CLINT. THESE INTERVIEWS ARE NOW SCHEDULED FOR TWENTY SIX WEEKS OUT WHICH IS COMPLETELY UNACCEPTABLE. ONCE AGAIN HALF OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE BEING PAID. WE ARE TARGET TRAINING TWO HUNDRED ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES TO HANDLE THE MOST COMMON ISSUES REQUIRING INTERVIEWS THEY WILL BEGIN IN MID NOVEMBER WE ARE ALSO COLD COAL CLEAN DIRECT CLAIMANTS DIRECTLY WHENEVER WE CAN RESOLVE. THE ISSUES IN THAT WAY AND WE ARE IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING A FORM THAT WILL BE SENT OUT TO THOSE WAITING FOR DETERMINATIONS WHICH MAY COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE NEED TO HAVE AN INTERVIEW. IN COMPARISON THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMANTS NEVER NEED AN INTERVIEW. 85% OF CUSTOMERS DURING THE PANDEMIC WERE PAID WITHIN ONE WEEK OF CERTIFIED FOR BENEFITS. THAT'S NO COMFORT TO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WAITING. IN SUMMARY WE HAVE CHANGED I AM A POLICIES AND PROCEDURES STREAMLINED PROCESS SINCE WE ARE AUTOMATING EVERYTHING WE CAN AND DEVELOPING PARALLEL I. T. SYSTEMS. ADDING MORE NEW FEATURES TO THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CALL CENTER. ARE WE SATISFIED NO WE ARE NOT. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CHANGES UNTIL THINGS ARE COMPLETE. I ESPECIALLY I WANT TO POINT OUT THAT I HAVE ALWAYS WELCOMED IN THIS DEPARTMENT IS ALWAYS WELCOMED THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE STATE AUDITOR THE STRIKE TEAM AND THE LEGISLATURE I'VE SPENT MANY HOURS ON CALLS WITH LEGISLATORS TALKING ABOUT THEIR IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS AND THEY HAVE COME THROUGH. WE ARE USING THE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE STRIKE TEAM RECOMMENDATIONS. AS A BLUEPRINT A ROAD MAP FOR HOW TO IMPROVE. IT WILL CONTINUE TOWARDS WORKING IMPLEMENTING ALL THE RECOMMENDATIONS IN FULL. YOU KNOW I THE IDEA THAT THE EDT IS DOING THE DOING THESE THINGS TO ACCOMMODATE OR RESPOND TO A HEARING IS THERE ARE UNFORTUNATELY NOT COMPLETELY ACCURATE EDT IS DOING THESE THINGS BECAUSE WE SEE THAT THERE ARE THE RIGHT THINGS TO DO. WE HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL LEADERSHIP TEAM NOW WE ARE HARD WORKING EMPLOYEES THEY ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE CLIENTS AND YES WE HAVE FAILED IN SOME SENSE IN SOME SITUATIONS. BUT WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICES. RESHAPED THE PARTNERSHIP WILL DEVELOP WITH THE LEGISLATURE DURING THIS TIME AND I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK LEGISLATIVE STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THEY HAVE DONE TO ASSIST. OUR CLIENTS WHO ARE YOUR CONSTITUENTS THIS. THE SITUATION WITH THE PANDEMIC WAS AN ALL HANDS ON BOARD SITUATION. YEAH PEOPLE HAVE STEPPED UP MAKING EFFICIENTLY TO HELP. THANK YOU. THANK YOU DIRECTOR SIGNS FOR THAT REPORT TO ME TO OPEN IT UP TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE DYESS- MISTER LUCKY. HELLO DIRECTOR SCIENCE THANK YOU FOR JOINING US TODAY AND- LISTENING TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY I KNOW IF YOU HAD A CHANCE TO. SEE THE- THE PROP AND I HAVE DISPLAYED HERE BUT WILL. IT ACTUALLY- ADDRESSES. THE THE FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN- DISPERSED BY YOUR YOUR DEPARTMENT AND THIS IS ONE OF THE- THE MORE CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATIONS IT'S ABOUT ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. AND WHAT I HAVE DISPLAYED HERE TWENTY NINE INDUSTRIAL. DUMP TRUCKS THAT WOULD IF THEY WERE FILLED WITH HUNDRED DOLLAR BILLS WOULD REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY. THAT HAS BEEN- PAID OUT AND FRAUDULENT CLAIMS. AND AN ORDER TO DISPERSE THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY. LINE UP ALMOST SEVENTEEN THOUSAND PEOPLE AND GIVE THEM ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A HOME WITH THE MEDIAN PRICE. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WOULD BE A WONDERFUL THING BUT WHAT'S HAPPENED IS THESE A FALL INTO THE HANDS OF PEOPLE WHO DO NOT DESERVE THAT KIND OF PAYMENT. AND I. I DID HEAR FROM THE AUDIT TEAM AND IT'S BEEN INDICATED THAT- THEY'VE SUGGESTED HE RESPONDED FAVORABLY. TOWARDS A FORMING A AFFRONT INVESTIGATIVE UNIT AND I WAS WONDERING. WHEN WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THE HIRING THOSE PEOPLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I AM VERY APPRECIATE TO THE DISTRESSED ABOUT HER. BOB THE NUMBER OF FRAUD CLAIMS THAT WERE PAID I JUST HAVE TO SAY AND I'VE I'VE SPOKEN TO A NUMBER OF STATE DIRECTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY. THERE'S NOT ONE STATE THEY DID NOT EXPERIENCE A SUBSTANTIAL. AMOUNT OF FRAUDULENT CLAIMS I THINK IN ARIZONA THEY HAD JOHN. TEXAS THEY HAD 14% OF THE CLAIMS WERE FRAUDULENT IN ARIZONA IT WAS CLOSE 234% SO WE HAVE ALL HAD DIFFICULTY WITH THIS. IN A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THOSE CLAIMS. WE WERE WAS BASICALLY AN ASSAULT BY CRIMINAL GANGS OUTSIDE THE COUNTRY AND INSIDE THE COUNTRY AND- WE'VE DONE QUITE A BIT TO STOP THAT YOU KNOW THIS IS AN INSURANCE PROGRAM AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE FAMILIAR WITH INSURANCE YOU KNOW THEIR INSURANCE PROGRAMS. ARE OFTEN TARGETED FOR FROM THE UNIT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT REQUIRED GETTING. HR APPROVALS WELL IN REACTIVE CONSTRUCTED ESTABLISH THE POLICIES ARE THOSE OF. WE WILL BE GOING TO MOVE PEOPLE INTO IT- LET ME ASK MY CHIEF DEPUTY OF OPERATIONS WHAT HER THOUGHT IS ABOUT THE TIMELINE. ANY. GOOD AFTERNOON THANKS FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY I'M EXCITED TO BE IN FRONT OF ME ALL TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT ATVS PROGRESS AS IT PERTAINS TO THE AUDITOR RECOMMENDATIONS I AM AS IT PERTAINS TO THE DESIGNATION OF THE FRAUD UNIT SPECIFICALLY- WE ARE CURRENTLY STILL WORKING WITH OUR CALIFORNIA OUR SKINNER GETTING RESOURCES DIVISION- TO EXECUTE ON THE MOVEMENT OF STAFF INTO THESE POSITIONS- AND ALSO WILL MANAGER ONE LEVEL POSITIONS I'M FOR THIS YEAR AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT IT BE FULLY STAFFED BY THE. END OF NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR. YEAH WE DEFINED VERY IMPORTANT WE HAVE STAFF THAT ARE MOVED INTO THE UNIT AS OPPOSED TO NEW HIRES- BECAUSE WE HAVE FOLKS THAT ARE. FAMILIAR WITH THE PROGRAM IN POSSESS THE KNOWLEDGE SKILLS AND ABILITIES. TO EXECUTE. AT THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE UNIT AS A WHOLE. I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR- QUESTION. YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH N. TO BE CLEAR THAT THE DIRECTION AND TIMELINE AS WE MOVE FORWARD AND SETTING GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS IS THAT B. THE FRAUD UNIT WILL BE FULLY VETTED AND FULLY STAFFED BY END OF NOVEMBER OF THIS YEAR. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S A CONFIRMATION. THAT'S CORRECT THANK YOU MISTER SALAS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU DIRECTOR FOR JOINING US FOR TODAY'S HEARING WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND ANSWERING QUESTIONS- THE NEW EARLIER YOU SAID. YOUR DEPARTMENT WAS OUT LIKE 70% LIMITING EVERYTHING AND YOU KNOW WHAT I. SPOKE WITH THE AUDITOR OF THE PREVIOUS PANEL I THOUGHT THIRTEEN OUT OF TWENTY ONE- THINGS BEING IMPLEMENTED THAT'S LIKE 62% SO LOVE TO SEE WHAT THAT. ADDITIONAL 8% AND REALLY GET TO THE HUNDRED PERCENT. OF FULLY IMPLEMENTATION OF ALL THE AUDITORS RECOMMENDATIONS BUT IT WILL. GO AHEAD SENATOR I CAN ASSURE YOU THAT THEY WILL BE MET. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT- I WANTED TO TOUCH ON SOMETHING YOU TALKED ABOUT EARLIER YOU TALKED ABOUT THE BACKLOG IN THE BACKLOG THAT WE HAD A- LAST YEAR AND THE AMOUNT THAT IT WAS. YOU KNOW BUT AND HE ALSO TOUCHED ON THIS YOU KNOW THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE THAT ARE STILL WAITING ON EDT TO GET THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. YEAH LAST I CHECKED I THINK YOU JUST CONFIRMED IT IN YOUR TESTIMONY. WAS THAT THERE WAS A BACKLOG OF PENDING. THAT THE BACKLOG OF PENDING CLAIMS THAT ARE TWENTY ONE DAYS OR OLDER WAS NEARLY A. HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CLAIMS. I'LL WELL THAT CURRENT NUMBER BY ON A PLANE AS MUCH THAN IT WAS A MY AGO. HI THIS IS STILL SIGNIFICANT OF UNRESOLVED CLAIMS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE REASON FOR THE CONTINUED BACKLOG AND WHAT IS THE ANTICIPATED. TIME FRAME FOR DEALING WITH THE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND. BEFORE I HAVE STAFF ASK THAT- ANSWERED LET ME SAY THAT- THERE HAS ALWAYS BEEN SOME BACKLOG WITH THE- SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT HAVE TO BE RESOLVED ARE VERY COMPLICATED. AS A MATTER OF FACT I WAS SURPRISED TO HEAR THIS MYSELF. ALTHOUGH IT DOES EXPLAIN SOME THINGS NEXT SOMETIMES IT COULD TAKE AS MANY AS A HUNDRED ITEMS TO CLEAR. OF HELD. FOR APPLYING THE RULES OF THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR ARE EXTREMELY COMPLICATED. AND EACH INDIVIDUAL HAS TO BE REVIEWED AS AN INDIVIDUAL ARE THERE ARE LIKE NOT GENERAL RULES FOR EVERYONE SO. THAT'S THAT'S A PART OF IT YEAH I'LL- AND I APPRECIATE THE DIRECTOR I'M JUST TRYING TO GET OUT BECAUSE I REMEMBER AT THE LAST HEARING YOU TOLD US THAT THE BACKLOG WOULD BE CLEARED BY THE END OF JAIL AND THEN THE END OF JUNE WAS THE END OF SUMMER. AND NOW THAT WE HAVE. EXCUSE ME SIR. LOG I THINK THEY ARE THE BACKGROUND THAT YOU'RE THINKING ABOUT IT THERE ARE THERE'S A BACKLOG AND THERE'S THE DEFERRED WORK OR WHAT THE WHAT THE- WHAT THE- STATE AUDITOR WAS TALKING ABOUT HIS THE DIFFERENT LOCAL. I CAME TO THE HEARING TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE WHAT THE DEFERRED WORK ALL DAY BOTH THE AUDITOR AND THE AUDITOR'S STAFF MENTIONED. AND WE CAME TO THE LEGISLATURE AND ASK FOR FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THOSE WITHIN A YEAR AND THE LEGISLATURE WE- ARE THIS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR LOSSES. IN THE PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE TRAFFIC'S NOT HAVING SCARY IT'S SO WEIRD CHESAPEAKE THAT THE DEFERRED BOOK ON WOULD BE- COMPLETED ONE YEAR. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU FOR THAT CLARIFICATION AND I COULD. AND SO THE DEFERRED WORKLOAD WOULD BE COMPLETED WITHIN A YEAR OF WHEN YOU REQUESTED THE RESOURCES FROM THE LEGISLATURE AND THAT WOULD GIVE A SINGLE MAJOR IT WILL BE. WHAT WHEN THE ALLEGED WHEN THE- BUDGET WAS APPROVED HER. SO THAT WAS KIND OF THE REQUEST BUT WHEN THE BUDGET WAS APPROVED SO THAT WOULD BE JULY. TO HIRE THOSE PEOPLE. SO I BELIEVE THAT'S JULY CORRECT. WHOA BY THE END OF THE HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND CLAIMANTS WITH THE TWENTY ONE DAYS OR OLDER. WHAT'S THE ANTICIPATION FOR THOSE CLAIMS. WELL AS YOU KNOW THIS IS KIND OF INTERESTING WINNER WHEN I READ CDSS THE SAME ISSUE- ALMOST ABOUT HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE ON- ONE CAL WORKS SO D. R. THIS IS NOT A HUNDRED AND FORTY THOUSAND. PAUL WHO IS A LIKE A BLOCK OF PEOPLE IN USE IS GOING THROUGH THAT WHERE THERE WERE ALWAYS GETTING NEW PEOPLE IN. SO TO GIVE YOU A COMPLETE- YOU KNOW LIKE ON A DEFINITE WINNER OF THE HUNDRED YOU KNOW I THINK. TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY THIS IS EXPLAINED TO MORE IN DETAIL I'M GOING TO ASK THE STAFF TO. EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW THIS WORKS PLEASE THANK YOU. WHO. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CRISTIAN FRAME THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FRENCH DEPUTY DIRECTOR THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE- I CAN SPEAK TO THE- LIQUIDATION AND WORKLOAD OF THE- DEFERRED WORKLOAD AS WELL AS SOME OF THE EFFORTS WERE DOING DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE WORKLOADS I MEAN WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS FRUSTRATING FOR CONSTITUENTS TO WAIT TWENTY SIX WEEKS FOR AN INTERVIEW AND WE AGREE THAT IT'S CERTAINLY NOT ACCEPTABLE I'M A WHAT WE ARE DOING TO REDUCE THE WAIT TIME OR ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR THE INTERVIEW ALL TOGETHER IS TO AS DIRECTOR SIGNS MENTIONED PARTY TRAINED THE RECENT GROUP OF STAFF THAT ARE OVER THE TOP ISSUES REQUIRING AN INTERVIEW FOR CONSTITUENTS. COLD CALLING CAN. TO OBTAIN INFORMATION THAT MAY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR AN INTERVIEW ALL TOGETHER. AND WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THE LEGISLATURE WE RECEIVE THE FUNDING TO ASSIST US IN COMPLETING THESE DEFERRED. AND PERSPECTIVE WORKLOADS WHICH INCLUDES THE INTERVIEW SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY INTERVIEW WORK WHAT. WE ARE ONBOARDING HUNDREDS OF AGENTS EVERY TWO WEEKS- PROVISIONING IN PROVIDING TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MEET THE TARGET- I DO WANT TO ENSURE COVERED A LITTLE BIT OF CLARIFICATION AS FAR AS- THE- WE RECEIVED A BUNCH THE FUDGE IT. SO YOU THINK WE RECEIVED THE BUDGET. AUTHORITY AND THE FUNDING AND WENT AND RELEASED A REQUEST FOR QUOTE. THAT CONTRACT WAS SIGNED IN JANUARY I'M SORRY IN SEPTEMBER OF THIS YEAR AND- WE EXPECT TO COMPLETE WITHIN ONE YEAR OF. OF THE CONTRACT ITSELF BEING AWARDED SO IT'S WHEN YOU'RE FROM SEPTEMBER FIRST JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THE- AND IF I COULD JUST FOLLOW UP ON THAT- THE PEOPLE THAT YOU'RE ONBOARDING THESE ARE GONNA BE PEOPLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY RESOLVE CLAIMS BECAUSE I CAN TELL YOU A LOT OF TIMES WHEN PEOPLE ARE CALLING. MY OFFICE AND I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES OFFICES AS WELL. IT'S ALWAYS. IT'S ALWAYS SOMETHING THAT CAN'T BE ANSWERED OR- THE CLAIM CAN'T REACH WAS ALL MEANT. ON LIKE THAT PHONE CALL OR THAT INTERVIEW. SO THE FOLKS THAT ARE BRINGING ON BOARD YOU'RE LOOKING AT. MORE MORE SENIOR PEOPLE THAT CAN ACTUALLY START RESOLVING THESE CLAIMS IS THAT WHAT I'M HEARING. SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE ACTUALLY CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH WE'RE OPERATING AND I'M WORKING THIS WORKLOAD I'M VERY SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE OUTLINED ITEMS IN THE RECESSION PLAN SO WHAT WE'RE DOING IS PROVIDING TARGET SPECIFIC TRAINING. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY FOUNDATION- IN CORE OF THE FOR THESE DEFERRED WORKLOAD VENDOR AGENTS THAT'LL BE ABLE TO ASSIST US IN TACKLING THE ADMINISTRATIVE- INFORMATION COLLECTION- SO THAT SPECIFIC INFORMATION DISCARDED TRAINING AND IT WE ARE MOVING- ANY OF THE ADDITIONAL ENHANCED AND SEPARATE ISSUES THAT WOULD TYPICALLY COME WITH. A STATE EMPLOYEE- ONBOARDING IN TRAINING- BROWN. AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IS ENSURING THAT ONCE THE INFORMATION IS COLLECTED AND OBTAINED IN A MORE EXPEDITIOUS MANNER GIVEN THE LEVEL AND NUMBER OF AGENTS THAT WE'RE ONBOARDING EVERY TWO WEEKS WE DON'T HAVE CITY STAFF AT ALL LEVELS TO FINALIZE THE EDUCATION. I'M AN INTERVIEW AND LIQUIDATE THE WORK LEFT. I HOPE THAT HELPED. MISSTATEMENT JUST TO A POINT OF CLARIFICATION ON STATE EMPLOYEES TO MISTER SALAS THIS QUESTION. THE GROUP THAT YOU ARE ONBOARDING TO HELP WITH THE TWENTY SIX WEEK- AND CONTINUED DELAYS AND- THE INTERVIEW ELIGIBILITY THAT'S PART OF THAT THE CONTRACT OF NON STATE EMPLOYEES NON UNION EMPLOYEES THAT ARE COMING IN TO SUPPORT. THE WORKLOAD OF EDT IS THAT CORRECT- A PORTION ALSO A DIRECTOR SIGNS MENTIONED THE TWO HUNDRED AGENTS- ARE THEY STATE STAFF THAT WERE ALSO TARGET TRAINING SEPARATE AND APART SO WE'RE MANAGING AND WORKING TO- WORK THIS WORKLOAD IN TWO DIFFERENT AND CONCURRENT. AVENUES TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN WORK THIS WORKLOAD FAST OKAY. I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT OF CLARIFICATION AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH- GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS AS TO WHAT THE WORKLOAD- AND WORK FORCE LOOKS LIKE. IN TERMS OF TURN AROUND OR- FOLKS THE MAKE COMMAND OR MAY NOT STATE OR WHAT IT ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE SO WE'RE LOOKING AT A TWO DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORK FORCE WE'RE LOOKING AT LONG TERM STATE-EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE BEEN. PART OF THE EDT SYSTEM FOR QUITE SOME TIME THAT HAVE INSTITUTIONAL AND INHERIT KNOWLEDGE THAT ARE PART OF. THE STATE WORKFORCE AND THEN WE'RE LOOKING CONCURRENTLY. ADD SUPPLEMENTAL WORK FORCE THAT'S CONTRACT BASE THAT'S NON UNION NON STATE EMPLOYEES HOW CAN WE ARE HOW ARE YOU DETERMINING. UNDER THAT WORK FORCE. HOW EXPEDITIOUSLY- THERE. MOVING THROUGH THE BACKLOG OR IS THERE A DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF. RAINING. THERE IS WE CERTAINLY A PULL UP PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FOUNDATION AND TRAINING FOR THE US STATE STAFF THAT WE WILL HAVE AND THAT HAVE BEEN ASSISTING US DURING THE PANDEMIC WE HAVE A SEPARATE AND APART- TARGET TRAINING WITH RESPECT TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION FOR THESE INTERVIEWS SPECIFICALLY- THE ELIGIBILITY INTERVIEWS- AND SO WHAT WE HAVE PUT TOGETHER IS- EIGHT. WORK LIQUIDATION PLAN AS THE AUDITOR OF SPOKE TO THAT ALLOWED US TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE BENCHMARKS THAT WILL ALLOW US TO COMPLETE AND WORK THIS WORKLOAD UTILIZING BOTH OF. THE STATE STAFF AND CONTRACTORS STAFF TO ENSURE WE MEET THAT ONE YEAR- EXPECTED TIMELINES. THANK YOU MISTER KNIGHT I APPRECIATE THE CLARIFICATION ESPECIALLY FOR THE MEMBERS OF THIS DIET AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH. WITH CREATING THE BENCHMARK NECESSARY FOR EDT IN TERMS OF THE ACCOUNTABILITY MEASUREMENTS OF THE WORK FORCE BEHIND ET DE BOTH OF WHICH ARE STATE EMPLOYEES. AS WELL AS CONTRACTED EMPLOYEES THIS IS THE FIRST TIME. THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS ENTERED INTO A CONTRACT OF NONUNION STATE EMPLOYEES WORKING FOR A DEPARTMENT WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT FOR US. TO UNDERSTAND IN TERMS OF ACCOUNTABILITY TRANSPARENCY AND WHO ULTIMATELY IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CALLS FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS SO TO MISTER SALAS THIS POINT. WHEN OUR STAFF GETS CALLS AND WE NEED THEN OUR DISTRICT OFFICES MOSTLY GETS CALLS AND THEN WE RE DIRECT THEM TO EDT. HOW ARE WE TO INSURE THAT WE ARE SPEAKING TO A- STATE. A TRAINED WHICH IS AS YOU MENTIONED A DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT OF TRAINING VERSUS A CONTRACTED EMPLOYEE WHICH WE HOPE WILL GET TO THE SAME LEVEL OF EFFICIENCY. AS A STATE EMPLOYEE. RIGHT SO I COULD CERTAINLY ALLOW- KEVIN TO ADD A LITTLE BIT AS FAR AS A LEGISLATIVE PARTNERSHIP WE HAVE WITH CONSTITUENT OFFICES BUT WE WILL HAVE THE VENDOR AGENCY CONTRACTED STAFF SEPARATE APART WORKING ON BE. THE WORKLOAD DEFERRED AND SOME OF THE PROSPECTIVE WORKLOADS WE WILL CONTINUE OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH THE STATE STAFF ARE LIAISING WITH YOUR OFFICES AND- THAT WILL MEAN THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN THE CONTINUITY OF THE INFORMATION AND THE SKILL SET THAT- WE HAVE PROVIDED. BUT WILL ALSO ENSURE THAT IT IS SEPARATE AND APART SO THAT- THE SPECIFIC- SKILLED. SKILLED EIGHT UP STATE STAFF ARE AVAILABLE I'M TO PROVIDE THAT CONSISTENT SUCCESS- OF- TRAINED EXPERIENCE TO THE OFFICES. THANK YOU FOR THAT AND THANK YOU MEDICARE FOR THE CLARIFICATION OBVIOUSLY AT THE END OF THE DAY WE WATER CONSTITUENTS TO GET THE ANSWERS THAT THEY NEED SO THAT THEY COULD GET THEIR CASE IS RESOLVED BUT IN HEARING- YOU KNOW THE RESPONSE IT. DOES BEG THE QUESTION ON WORKFORCE I'M WONDERING WHAT THE RETENTION LEVELS ARE. AT AT AT EDT RIGHT NOW BECAUSE IF YOU'RE ALWAYS HIRING HIRING YOU KNOW THERE'S OBVIOUSLY THAT LEARNING CURVE TO HELP RESOLVE THESE ISSUES HAVE YOU HAD A PROBLEM WITH THE RETENTION IS AN ISSUE THAT ARE NON ISSUE. I'M JUST CURIOUS THOUGH JUST BECAUSE OF THE RESPONSES. GARCIA BEFORE YES AND LET ME JUST SAY THAT ONE OF THE THINGS- PROBABLY- ALL. ARE REASSURED THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS THAT. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE HAVE A VERY OLD LEGACY SYSTEM. WE HAVE BEEN DOING CARILLO IMPROVEMENTS ON IT BECAUSE WE CAN'T WAIT FOR. WITH AND ART WE ARE LAW OF OUR PROCESS IS SIMPLE THAT WILL ALLOW EXPERIENCED AND MATURE STAFF MERIT STAFF TO BE ABLE TO CLOSE THE CASES WHEN SO WHAT YOU KNOW OUR LONG TERM GOAL WHICH IS TO INSURE AS MUCH AS AUTOMATED AS POSSIBLE TO ALLOW FOR FEWER PEOPLE TO HAVE A MORE. IMPORTANT IMPACT CLOSING THESE CASES MOST OF THE THINGS THAT WERE DONE AT EGP BEFORE THE PANDEMIC UNFORTUNATELY. WHAT PAPERWORK. UNDERSTOOD SO IS THERE A ISSUE WITH PERSONNEL AND WORK FIRST THOUGH IN TERMS OF RETENTION WITH WORKERS IS AT A NON ISSUE IS THAT AN ISSUE AT AT THE DEPARTMENT. LET ME JUST SAY THAT ABOUT. HAVING EXPERIENCE BOTH IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND THE PRIVATE SECTOR. IN A CALL CENTER THERE IS YOU- GENERALLY THIRTY PERCENT. TURNOVER EVERY YEAR. SO IN THAT RESPECT WE ARE WE ARE IN THE SAME SITUATION AND I MUST SAY THAT YOU KNOW. EDT WHEN I WAS NOT HERE LAST YEAR WAS UNDER QUITE A PRESSURE COOKER AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF PEOPLE CHARTER. WE HAD MANAGER STEPPED DOWN SO WHAT WE DID LISTEN STAFF. UNDERSTOOD YEAH I LOOK FORWARD OBVIOUSLY WE'RE GONNA WANT TO DELVE INTO SOME OF THOSE ISSUES TO TRY TO HELP BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE JUST WANNA GET HELP FOR CONSTITUENTS. BUT I DID WANT TO ASK A QUESTION BECAUSE ONLY A THREE QUESTIONS AND- BUT YOU HAD. MENTIONED THE BENEFITS MODERNIZATION YOU DID IN YOUR OPENING AND YOU JUST REFERENCED IT RIGHT NOW. YOU KNOW- THE LEGISLATURE IS ALLOCATED TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AT TWO EDT TO REFOCUS ON THE BSM PROJECT YOU MIGHT. ASK YEAH THE FIRST PANEL. AT THIS QUESTION EARLIER BECAUSE IT STARTED BACK IN. TWENTY SIXTEEN SO IT'S LIKE THAT FIVE YEARS THAT. SO IF ONE TO ADD WHERE YOU EXT THIS TO BE ABLE. TO SAID WE'RE TRY TO ADAM FOR TRY TO- YOUR HOME IT AND THIS NEW BENEFITS. D. SEE THAT. COMING COMPLETELY. SOON YOU SAID YOU'VE USED SOME SOME ASPECTS OF IT ALREADY. THERE ARE YES. WE SIGNED OUT. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF IMPROVEMENTS THAT WOULD THAT WOULD MEAN THAT WE AUTOMATE. FOR SOME PAPERWORK PROCEDURES IN ADDITION TO THAT WE ARE WE HAVE A PARALLEL I. T. SYSTEM- AND IN THAT PARA WHAT IT SYSTEM WE SOMETIMES MOVE. SOLUTIONS TO A PROBLEM OR NOT A NATION INTO THE PARALLEL IT SYSTEM SO THAT WE'RE NOT OVER BURDENING MAINFRAME. SO THAT THAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. IN ADDITION TO THAT WE HAVE EVERY TIME WE CHANGE OF POLICY WE NEED TO DO IT EVERYTHING COSTS ARE CHEAP. SO YOU KNOW THIS YEAR IN ADDITION TO MAKE ANY CHANGES WE HAD TO MAKE WE ALSO HAD THESE NEW FEDERAL PROGRAMS THAT WE HAD TO IMPLEMENT AND THEN WE HAD TO THE COMMISSION. SHOW UP WHAT WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW BILLS AND THANKS TO THE LEGISLATURE. IS OUT WE WERE GIVEN FUNDS TO. REVIEW ALL OUR BUSINESS PROCESSES IN OUR BUSINESS RULES NOW FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE. FAMILIAR WITH T PROGRAMS AND I KNOW. BECAUSE OF OVERSIGHT YOU ARE. WELL THE IMPLEMENTATION OF AN IT SYSTEM. IS 80% GETTING THE BUSINESS RULES RIGHT IN TRAINING THE STAFF AND 20% IMPLEMENTATION. SO YOU WILL YOU'LL SEE THAT IN THIS COMING YEAR WE WILL COME TO YOU WITH THIS THESE BUSINESS RULES OR REVIEW AND REVISION ARE DONE. WE WILL COME TO YOU AND ASK YOU FOR FUNDS TO LOOK AT THE INITIATION OF THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM. OKAY SO WE'VE WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON FOR FIVE YEARS WOULD YOU SAY WERE HALFWAY THERE WERE ALMOST THERE ONCE WE GET THESE BUSINESS RULES DONE AS A JOURNALIST AND KIND OF WERE RANDOMLY OFFICER HOW MUCH MORE. YOU ALSO ONE OF THE REASONS THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE BUSINESS RULES REVIEW AND SUCH A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME FOR A RELATIVELY COMPLEX. PROGRAM COLLUDING YOU IPFL. TAX BRANCH AND DINNER DIAZ YES BECAUSE WE'RE TAKING SOME OF THE WORK DONE ON THE BSM SYSTEM OVER THESE NUMBER OF YEARS SO THAT'S ALLOWING US TO TRUNCATE THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT WILL BE DOING THESE BUSINESS RULES PROCESSES. ARE SO- AS YOU MAY REMEMBER. THE B. S. M. WAS. OKAY DURING THE BECAUSE THE STAFF WAS WORKING ON IT WAS NEEDED TO CLEANING. SO THAT WHY IT WAS- THAT'S WHY IT WAS IT. SO DO YOU SEE THIS FALL AMPLE THEN YEAR ONCE COME BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH THE B. S. EMERALD TRIANGLE I DON'T SEE IT FULLY IMPLEMENTED- I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED MUCH FASTER THAN YOU SEEN SOME I. T. SYSTEMS ARE. PARTICULARLY BECAUSE IN THE OLD DAYS WE USED TO USE WATERFALL WHICH IS WE WORKED AND WORKED AND WORKED ON IT AND THEN. WE. ARE UNVEILED IT TO THE PUBLIC. WE'RE USING ASSIST CALLED AGILE NOW. AND WE WILL BE IMPLEMENTING THINGS. IN IN PHASES SO NO YOU WON'T SEE THE ENTIRE. SITUATION BUT IT WILL TAKE ME PROBABLY TAKE ANOTHER COUPLE OF THE- ABSOLUTELY FULLY IMPLEMENTED BUT IT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED IN STAGES. OKAY WELL WE'LL FOR THE COMING KEEPING TABS ON THAT OBVIOUSLY THE QUICKER THE SM PROJECTS ONLINE OR FULLY IMPLEMENTED IT HELPS WITH THE TURN AROUND AND WAIT TIMES FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS TO ACTUALLY GET THE CASE RESOLVED. AS HAD ONE FINAL QUESTION IF I MAY. YOU TALKED ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF CALLS THAT YOU GUYS A PROCESS I THINK YOU SAID IT WAS TEN MILLION CALLS SHE HAS OF DONE THROUGH THE CALL CENTER. AND I WAS JUST WONDERING BECAUSE I KNOW I BELIEVE IT WAS EITHER THE LEGISLATURE OR THE STRIKE TEAM. THAT HAD A REPORT TALKING ABOUT HOW MANY OF THE CALLS RECEIVED A CALL CENTERS ACTUALLY HELPED REACHED A RESOLUTION FOR THE PERSON CALLING IN FOR THEIR CLAIM AND IT WAS. ABYSMALLY LOW IT WAS LIKE LESS THAN 5% NOW YOU SAID NOW YOU GUYS OF PROCESS TEN MILLIONS DE ARE YOU KEEPING STATISTICS ON THAT'S FINE YOU'RE GETTING ALL THESE CALLS IN YOUR ANSWERING THEM BUT ARE YOU RESOLVING THE CASES. AND DO YOU HAVE STATISTICS ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE'RE TRYING TO GET ON WITH THE PERSONNEL QUESTIONS IS ARE WE HAVE OKAY PEOPLE ACTUALLY ANSWER AND RESOLVE CASES SO THAT PEOPLE ARE WAITING TWENTY SIX WEEKS. YOU KNOW FOR AN INTERVIEW- EXCITER. OKAY I THINK I'M GONNA ALL REFER THIS THE CHIEF OR TO DEPUTY OF THE. FAULKNER AND CHIEF DEPUTY DIRECTOR OVER- SO YES THANKS TO THE CSA RECOMMENDATION WE HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO OUR CALL CENTER WHICH INCLUDES IMPLEMENTING A POLICY FOR TRACKING AND MONITORING THEIR RATE OUR FIRST CALL RESOLUTION. AND WE REVIEW THESE DATA ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO ENSURE WE'RE PROVIDING EFFECTIVE ASSISTANCE TO CALLERS PENSION SYSTEM. I DON'T KNOW IF YOU'D LIKE ELABORATE ON THAT AND GARCIA. YES ABSOLUTELY SO- OF COURSE WE ARE PUTTING A FEW- ENHANCEMENTS WOULD HAVE ROLLED OUT SOME ENHANCEMENTS AND WE ALSO ARE WORKING TO OUR RELEASE SOME SOME ADDITIONAL ENHANCEMENTS THAT ALLOW US NOT ONLY TO. PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO CUSTOMERS- THEIR BODY IN AN ATTEMPT TO AND HOPEFULLY ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A CONSTITUENTS TO CALL IN- AND SOME OF THE THINGS WE PUT IN PLACE TO ENSURE- WE HAVE THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEM IS TO WE BROUGHT OUT OUR VIRTUAL HOLD WHICH- HAS BEEN SPOKEN ABOUT- TODAY WE HAVE RELEASED A MOBILE FRIENDLY. UPGRADE THAT ALLOWS CONSTITUENTS TO UPLOAD DOCUMENTS APPLY FOR BENEFITS SUBMIT THE BI WEEKLY ELIGIBILITY CERTIFICATION- VIEW PAYMENT HISTORY AND PAYMENT STATUS ALL FROM THEIR MOBILE DEVICE- AND WE'VE ALSO RELEASED THE CLAIM STATUS TRACKER TRACKER- ON ARE YOU AYE ONLINE WHICH PROVIDES CONSTITUENTS WITH THE STATUS OF THE CLAIM- THAT'LL HELP WITH UNDERSTANDING- WHERE THEIR CLAIM FALLS WITHIN- IT. ANY KIND OF PENDING ELIGIBILITY ISSUE THAT IS REQUIRING AN INTERVIEW I'M A PHONE INTERVIEW THAT HAS BEEN SCHEDULED OR THAT HAS PASSED IT IS PENDING A DECISION. OR WEEKS THAT THE CONSTITUENT CONSERVE I- ALL OF THIS IN- IN CONCURRENT SESSION WITH LAUNCHING THE VOICE OF THE CUSTOMER WHICH ALLOWS US TO TRACK CUSTOMER QUESTIONS AND PROACTIVELY PROVIDE THOSE ANSWERS IN THE. CHAT BOX AND ON ON OUR WEBSITE. OTHER THANK THANK YOU FOR EXT THE BUT I'M JUST TO GET AT. YOU KNOW THE NUMBER LIKE. WITHIN TWO OR THREE PHONE CALLS X. AMOUNT OF CLAIMANTS CASES ARE RESOLVED DID YOU GUYS KEEP THOSE STATISTICS THIRTY OR NOT. I THINK DURING THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. IT WAS THE REASON THAT THE STATE ORDERS TO RIMAC RECOMMENDED THAT I'M NOT SURE THAT. IT THAT WAS KEPT DURING THAT TIME BUT IT IS BEEN INITIATED NOW SPEAK INITIATED THAT OKAY YEAH BECAUSE I THINK THOSE ARE METRICS THAT HELP US WITH THE LEGISLATURE TO HELP US. YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY WITH THE PUBLIC AS WELL WHO WOULD WANT TO KNOW THOSE. THOSE NUMBERS THANK. YES SENATOR SENATOR SALAS. I JUST LIKE TO REITERATE THIS OF. WE WELCOME ANY OUR THOUGHTS AND IDEAS FROM THE LEGISLATURE OF IT AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED I HAVEN'T RUN THIS IS MY FOURTH DEPARTMENT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST ROBUST PARTNERSHIPS THAT I'VE HAD AS A DIRECTOR AND YEAH ARE WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT YEAH WE'RE JUST TRYING TO RESOLVE ISSUES MAKES GOVERNMENT WORK MORE EFFICIENT FOR THE CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. I KNOW THAT THAT. THE MEMBERS ON THE DIETS ARE ANXIOUS TO ASK ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS AS WELL. BEFORE WE MOVE WE MOVE ON I JUST I WANNA POINT OF CLARIFICATION. BUT IT WAS MENTIONED THAT 30% OF THE CALL CENTER STAFF- THERE'S THAT THERE'S A RETENTION ISSUE WHERE WHAT IS WHAT IS THE TRAINING TIMELINE. TO HIRE. INDIVIDUALS INTO THE CALL CENTER I WANT TO GET A BETTER UNDERSTANDING IN TERMS OF RETENTION UNDERSTANDING- TRANSPARENCY AND ULTIMATELY HELP THE HELP THE GOES INTO THE PEOPLE THAT ARE CALLING CALIFORNIANS ARE CALLING INTO THE CALL CENTER IN TERMS OF RECEIVING EIGHT. SO IF THERE'S A 30% RETENTION ISSUE WHAT IS THE TIMELINE IN WHICH NEWS NEW INDIVIDUALS ARE BEING TRAINED INTO THE CALL CENTER. GARCIA WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THE CALL AND- MAY MAY I POINT OUT THAT- 30% AS I SAID IS A TRADITIONAL- STATISTIC OUR CALL CENTERS PRIVATE AND IN PUBLIC. YES TO ADD A LITTLE BIT MORE TO THAT WE ARE SEEING THAT 30% OF TUITION RATE AND UNFORTUNATELY WE HAVE HAD OUR- OUR AGENTS ON THE FRONT LINES ARE PROVIDING SERVICES TO CONSTITUENTS- SEVEN DAYS A WEEK TWELVE HOURS A DAY WHICH CERTAINLY HAS LED TO- INCREASED- FATIGUE AND FRUSTRATION AS WELL AS MUCH AS WE DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SUPPORT OUR INTERNAL STAFF WITH THE NECESSARY RESOURCES AND TRAINING. ON THE TYPICAL TRAINING FOR OUR- OUR NEW LOOK ONBOARDED EMPLOYS APPROXIMATELY FOUR MONTHS AND THAT ALLOWS- DIFFERENT METRICS AND ON THE JOB TRAINING TO ENSURE THAT THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT FROM THEIR DIRECT MANAGER I'M TO BE ABLE TO FIELD MANY OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT COME UP WHEN WE DO HAVE SOME SHADOW- TRAINING SIDE BY SIDE THAT WILL ENSURE THAT WE PROVIDE SOME REINFORCEMENT TO STUFF AS WELL SO THAT WE CAN IN. SUPPORT STAFF AND ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING SUCH LONG HOURS. THANK YOU FOR THAT AGAIN JUST THE I WANT TO POINT OUT JUST THE COMPLEXITIES OF ONBOARDING TRAINING. OF ANY DEATH. AND HOW IT CAN HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE LONG CALL CALL TIMES AN- INTERVIEW. IT INTERVIEW PROCESS AND WHATEVER THAT LOOKS LIKE IT TAKES FOUR MONTHS TO TRAIN INDIVIDUALS TO GO INTO THE CALL CENTER CALL CENTER AND THERE'S A 30% RETENTION- ISSUE THEN THAT'S CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT COMPLICATES. ASSISTING CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE CALLING IN. AND SO I JUST I WANNA MAKE THAT VERY CLEAR THAT THAT IS THAT IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- MISTER KELLY YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS. I YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH- GOOD AFTERNOON THAT DIRECTOR OF ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE LARGE WORKLOAD FOR YOUR DEPARTMENT IS THE VERY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN CALIFORNIA- WHICH HAS REMAINED- MUCH HIGHER HERE THAN IN OTHER STATES THAT RETURN TO RELATIVELY NORMAL LEVELS AND- WE NOW HAVE THE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT IN THE COUNTRY. WHY THAT IS. I THINK TO GIVE YOU ARE AS ACCURATE. RESPONSE ON THAT AS POSSIBLE LET ME JUST SAY IN GENERAL. WE ARE ALL AWARE OF THE DIFFICULTIES THAT PEOPLE ARE. HAVING WITH HIRING BUT WE ALSO THERE ARE A LOT OF DIFFICULTIES BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB. ONE OF THE CENTRAL OF THEM IS THERE A FOR WOMEN ESPECIALLY. A CHILD CARE. YEAH I'M GONNA HAVE A CALEB OR OF ANY WHICH OF YOU WOULD LIKE TO. HANDLE THAT. YEAH THIS IS CALEB MORAL- CHIEF OF THE FISCAL PROGRAMS DIVISION FOR UNITY I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- I DON'T KNOW IF I CAN REALLY RESPOND TO WHY CALIFORNIA IS PERHAPS WORSE OFF THAN THAN OTHER STATES WHAT I CAN SAY IS THAT THE RECOVERY IN CALIFORNIA LIKE OTHER STATES HAS BEEN A LOT- QUICKER THAN WHAT WE PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED- I KNOW THAT ECONOMIC RATES ARE PROJECTED- UNEMPLOYMENT RATES MOVING INTO THE NEXT CALENDAR YEAR ARE PROJECTED TO BE A LOT LOWER THAN WHAT THEY PREVIOUSLY WERE- AS I THINK ALL OF YOU MEMBERS THAT HAVE SPOKEN ABOUT. THIS RECESSION WAS ONE THAT WAS VERY UNIQUE AND THAT THE ONSET OF IT WAS SO QUICK AND THAT THE- IMPACT TO- CLAIMANTS IN THE STATE- WAS SO RAPID AND SUDDEN AND IT CAUSED MASSIVE INCREASES IN UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM WHICH WAS VERY DIFFERENT FROM THE GREAT RECESSION AND THEN WHAT WE'RE ALSO SEEING ON THE BACK END IS THE RECOVERY IS DIFFERENT THAN WHAT THE RECOVERY WASN'T ADDRESS RECESSION AS WELL WHICH WAS A LOT MORE GRADUAL WE'RE SEEING A MUCH MORE SON RECOVERY THEN WHAT WAS DEFINITELY PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED AND I CAN- INDICATE THAT. IT LEAST CURRENT PUBLIC ECONOMIC FORECAST DUE TO ANTICIPATED HEADING INTO THIS NEXT CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE PERHAPS DIPPING DOWN INTO ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF PERCENT LEVEL- OUT AS AN AVERAGE FOR THE STATE AND THEN BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE I'M MOST MAJOR- ECONOMIC INDICATORS AND FORECASTS ARE PREDICTING UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS TO BE BACK TO- ALMOST PRE PANDEMIC LEVELS- HELP HOVERING. IN THE MID 4% RANGE. I HOPE THAT HELPS AND YOUR QUETION. WELL I DON'T REALLY SEE HOW- WE HAD A QUICK RECOVERY OUR UNEMPLOYMENT RATE HAS BARELY BUDGED THIS YEAR WHERE AS IN OTHER STATES IT'S BEEN DIFFERENT AND SO HE HAS A QUESTION FOR YOU MAYBE FOR THE DIRECTOR I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE LITERALLY LOST IN THE COUNTRY AND SO OTHER STATES HAVE DONE A BETTER JOB OF GETTING PEOPLE-BACK TO WORK. WHAT IS IT YOU THINK THAT THEY'RE DOING THAT WE'RE NOT. ACTUALLY I DON'T THINK THAT THE- THEY'RE DOING ANYTHING SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT THAN WE'RE DOING OF WE'VE HAD AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF WORKERS WHO QUIT THEIR JOBS AND DECISION BY WORKERS NOT TO JOIN THE LABOR FORCE THAT'S HAPPENING ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. AND JOB. WE LOST A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION. A FROM YOUR BUSINESSES- THE ONE AREA THAT WE ARE SEEING SOME IMPROVEMENT IS THE AREA THAT WAS THE HARDEST HIT LAST YEAR AND THAT WAS- HOSPITALITY AND- ENTERTAINMENT I THINK SO- RIGHT YOU KNOW IT'S A GOOD QUESTION. WE HAVE A RESEARCH TEAM THAT WE CAN TAKE A LOOK MORE CLOSELY AT THE QUESTION THAT YOU ASKED. SO THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I CAN SAY RIGHT NOW SO WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU ON. I'M HAPPY TO ALLOW RATE A LITTLE BIT DIRECTOR SIGNS- I'M AMY FAULKNER AGAIN CHIEF DEPUTY OF OPERATIONS. SO WE DO HAVE ECONOMIST AT THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT THAT ARE REGULARLY MONITORING. IRON POINT RATE AND FLUCTUATIONS OF THE M. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. AND TRACKING HOW CALIFORNIANS DOING AS OPPOSED TO THE NATION. AND ACCORDING TO THEIR KIND OF ANALYSIS. AND REVIEW OF THE LATEST WORK FORCE THERE ARE SEVERAL TRANSCEND HAVE KIND OF HAMPERED. THE RAPID DECLINE OF THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. SOME OF THOSE TRENDS INCLUDE A BUSINESS HIRING TRENDS. INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS AS THE DIRECTOR MENTIONED. INCREASES IN THE NUMBER OF WORKERS THAT QUIT JOBS AND THE DECISIONS OF WORKERS JUST SIMPLY NOT TO JOIN THE LABOR FORCE. AND IN TERMS OF THE BUSINESS HIRING TRENDS- THERE FOLLOWING RESEARCH PUBLIC AVAILABLE RESEARCH. THAT HAS KIND OF SAID THAT FIRMS HAVE REDUCED UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS DURING THE RECESSIONARY PERIODS. AND THAT THEY'VE UNDER UTILIZED EMPLOYEES ON THEIR PAYROLL SO INSTEAD OF CREEK INCREASING THE NUMBER OF WORKERS IN THE SHORT TERM. SOME BUSINESSES ARE LOOKING TO UTILIZE THEIR CURRENT WORKFORCE. BEFORE ADDING NEW EMPLOYEES. I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR KIND OF ALLUDED TO YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA BABY BOOMERS AND PEOPLE BETWEEN NINETEEN FORTY SIX TO NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR THAT CONTINUE TO REQUIRE. AND RETIRE IN INCREASING NUMBERS. AND THERE'S IMPLICATIONS THERE AS IT PERTAINS TO THE STATE EMPLOYMENT. THE STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE. I THINK IN THE TO THE THERE IS MOST GIVE FOR NUMBER. TO THE LABO AND- INCLUDE TAKING FOR. SCHOOL ENROLLMENT AND DISABILITY. WHEN WE CAN GET TO THE NUMBERS ON IF YOU'D LIKE THAT THAT BE GREAT THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENT TO LOOKING INTO THIS ISSUE CLOSELY I KIND OF STRUGGLE TO UNDERSTAND HOW IT IS IN THE CENTRAL ISSUE- THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS FOCUSED ON- NOT ONLY BECAUSE- IT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT MEASURE OF OUR- STATE'S ECONOMIC HEALTH BUT ALSO BECAUSE THE BEST WAY TO DEAL WITH- YOU KNOW THE UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIM BACKLOG IS TO HAVE YOUR UNEMPLOYMENT CLAIMS. ASIDE JUST ABSOLUTELY UNDERSTAND WHY THAT ISN'T THE TOP PRIORITY OF THE DEPARTMENT. WELL ONE OF THE THINGS. IS SO YOU SO. YOU KNOW OUR EDG IS NOT JUST UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WE ALSO HAVE A WORKFORCE SERVICES BRANCH. AND THEY HAVE DONE A SUBSTANTIAL OUT REACH. ARE TO THE COMMUNITY TO GET PEOPLE BACK TO WORK WE OFFER TRAINING PROGRAMS AND WE FUND. LOCAL ORGANIZATIONS. TO DO TRAINING PROGRAMS. ONE OF THE THINGS THAT'S HAPPENING IS THAT PEOPLE ARE WAITING TO GET A BETTER JOB. IT DOESN'T MEAN NECESSARILY THAT THEY HAVE THE SKILLS. TO FOR FILL THAT JOB. SO YOU KNOW I JUST TALKED TO MY- OUR DEPUTY OVER THERE. AND THEY ARE SURPRISED AT THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE NOT TAKING. THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET ADDITIONAL TRAINING. SO OUR- WE ARE OUT THERE ARE POUNDING THE PAVEMENT TRYING TO GET PEOPLE JOBS WE WORK YOU KNOW IN OUR AMERICAN. JOB CENTERS WE HAVE PEOPLE THERE ARE WORKING WITH PEOPLE TO GET THE BETTER JOBS AND JOB WE'RE JUST NOT GETTING THE UPTICK THAT WE EXPECTED. THANK YOU ARE THAT ON ANOTHER TOPIC THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TRUST FUND MY- UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE DEBT TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ON TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS NOW AND THAT- THAT BUSINESSES ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT THROUGH INCREASED PAYROLL TAXES IS THAT. CORRECT DO YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT. YES I APPRECIATE THE QUESTION- SO I CAPABLE FISCAL OFFICER THREE D. YOU'RE CORRECT THE CURRENT- OUTSTANDING TRUST FUND DEBT FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT NINETEEN POINT EIGHT BILLION AS OF THE END OF LAST WEEK. AND THAT THE EXISTING MECHANISM TO PAY DOWN A TRUST FUND AT WHICH WAS THE SAME MECHANISM THAT EXISTS IN FEDERAL LAW AND HOW WE CLIMBED OUT OF DEBT- AFTER THE GREAT RECESSION IS THROUGH- FEDERAL UNEMPLOYMENT TAX ACT CREDIT REDUCTIONS THAT'S THE FEDERAL TAX ID EMPLOYERS PAY TO THE IRS- FOR YOU I TAXES. AND THAT WILL START TO BE INCREASED COMING TAX YEAR TWENTY TWENTY TWO- MOST EMPLOYERS PAY THAT TAX THE BEGINNING OF THE FOLLOWING YEAR SO MOST EMPLOYERS WILL START TO SEE THAT HIGHER INCREASED FEDERAL TAX COMING ON JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND JUST TO BE CLEAR THE PORTION OF THAT. DEBT THAT HAS RESULTED FROM THE FRAUD. THAT TOO WILL BE- IT PAID BACK THROUGH INCREASED PAYROLL TAXES ON THE PART OF THE EMPLOYERS. IS THAT CORRECT. TO WHAT EXTENT FEDERAL YOU AYE BENEFITS HAVE BEEN PAID OUT FRAUDULENTLY IN THE REGULAR YOU AYE PROGRAM ANYTHING CONTRIBUTED TO THAT TRUST FUND DEBT THAT IS PART OF THAT OVERALL- TRUST FUND THAT APPLICATION. MARIN TO THAT- A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FROG ADA. WAS PAID OUT OF. IN THE FEDERAL PROGRAM THE P. WAY PROGRAM. AND THE FINAL QUESTION. OF ALL THE FOLKS ALL THE EMPLOYEES AT I. D. D. L. MANAGEMENT OR OTHERWISE DO YOU KNOW ROUGHLY HOW MANY HAVE BEEN TERMINATED FOR SUB STANDARD JOB PERFORMANCE SINCE HE BECAME DIRECTOR. I'D HAVE TO I'D HAVE TO GET SOME STATISTICS ON THAT. GENEROSA INCIDENT IS IT YOU KNOW SINGLE YOUNG DOUBLE DIGITS NO I DON'T AND I DON'T HAVE ANY SENSE THAT IT'S AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT. AN UNUSUAL AMOUNT MEANING A HIGH AMOUNT. YES OKAY I MEAN I THINK SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THE PROBLEMS THE EDS HAD MAYBE THERE'S ROOM FOR- SOME PERSONNEL CHANGES- OKAY I'M SORRY I COULD NOT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE ASKING I'M SORRY SO- LET ME. LET ME SAY THIS. THE ISSUE ADD. IS NOT. THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN EXCEPTIONAL GROUP OF PEOPLE. WHO ARE DEDICATED TO GETTING THIS WORK DONE. AND THAT THEY ARE COMPETENT WE HAVE A LIBRARY THAT OUR STAFF IS VERY COMPETENT NOT I CAN SAY THAT BECAUSE I RUN ALL THE DEPARTMENTS. OKAY SO THERE'S NO LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN THIS DEPARTMENT. IF YOU GO BACK TO WHAT THE STATE ARBITRATION IT REALLY IS WAS A FAILURE OF SYSTEMS. THE BUSINESS RULES THAT YOU TO DATE HAS BEEN OPERATING UNDER. THE LEGACY SYSTEM THAT IT HAS HAD TO CONTEND WITH. THE NEW RULES AND NEW PROGRAMS WERE ON A GESTURE THAT CAME TO EDT THOSE WERE A LARGE PART OF THE PROBLEMS FOR EDT. SO IT IS IT IS NOT THE PEOPLE. IT WAS THE SYSTEMS THAT YOU DD WAS OPERATING UNDER. THAT CREATED THE PROBLEM IN ADDITION TO HAVING TO DEAL WITH A STAGGERING WORKLOAD. ARE THERE ANY WAYS IN WHICH YOU KNOW YOU COULD BE GIVEN GREATER. CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY OVER HOW YOU MANAGE YOUR PERSONNEL- THAT YOU THINK WOULD LEAD TO A BETTER PERFORMANCE OF THIS AGENCY OR THE OTHERS THE RUN- FOR THAT MATTER WILL. THINK IT'S A WONDERFUL QUESTION- AND- I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE MADE CHANGES. BUT I MEAN IN TERMS OF WHAT IS A LIAR. WHAT YOU TO DO UNDER EITHER STATE LAW OR THE RELEVANT- CONTRACTS. HAVING BEEN A CIVIL SERVANT. OFTEN IN FORTY YEARS LET ME SAY THAT. THERE IS A BALANCE BETWEEN ATTRACTIONS ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES AND OF THE KINDS OF PROCESSES THAT HAVE TO BE UNDERTAKEN TO MOVE EMPLOYEES OUT OKAY. R. IF YOU TALK TO ANYONE WHO KNEW ME AS A DIRECTOR BEFORE. THEY CAN TELL YOU. I HAVE MOVED AS MANY AS TWO HUNDRED PEOPLE. AT A TIME OUT OF THE DEPARTMENT SO I AM RELUCTANT I HAVE PLENTY OF FLEXIBILITY AND I WILL I AM ALSO HERE TO TELL YOU IF PEOPLE ARE. ON OUR STEM. ARE BEING INAPPROPRIATE. WITH ANY CRIME OR THEY'RE NOT GETTING THEIR JOB DONE IT COMES TO MY ATTENTION. AND IT'S VERY SELDOM THAT WE HAVE HAD TO. FIRE PEOPLE FOR INCOMPETENCE. VERY SELDOM. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I'M THANK YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS THAT I'D LIKE TO JUMP INTO- THAT BEFORE I DO AND I DON'T WANT TO BEAT A DEAD HORSE BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO BE TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT'S HAPPENED AND I THINK YOU SAID THAT THE FAILINGS WERE THE RESULT OF SYSTEM FAILURES THE ACTUAL TITLE OF THE AUDIT THAT WE'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT. ACTUALLY IS CALLED EDIE'S POOR PLANNING AND INEFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT LEFT UNPREPARED TO ASSIST CALIFORNIANS UNEMPLOYED BY COVERED NINETEEN SHUT DOWN SO JUST RESPONDING TO YOUR LAST RESPONSE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT MOMENT THAT APT AT OKAY A COUPLE OF VERY SPECIFIC QUESTIONS TO FIRST IN FRAUD WHAT IS YOUR UPDATED ESTIMATE OF- THE FRAUD THAT WAS PERPETRATED THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC. OF THE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PAID OUT. TWENTY BILLION IS ESTIMATED TO BE FRAUDULENT. TWENTY BILLION OKAY. AND I'M I KNOW IT IN YOUR OPENING REMARKS YOU YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU'VE DONE QUITE A BIT TO STOP THIS. AT BEYOND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF CROSS CHECKING WITH CDCR WHICH I'M REALLY FAMILIAR WITH CAN YOU. ARTICULATE WHICH SPECIFIC PROGRAMS. THAT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED OR WHAT SPECIFIC CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO MAKE OUR FRAUD DEFENSES MORE ROBUST. ABSOLUTELY ASSEMBLY RUNNING- WE HAVE- WE HIRED ID ME- AND THOMSON REUTERS BOTH OF WHICH COMPANIES ARE ARE THAT WERE CONSIDERED FOR THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IN THEIR NEW- FRAUD PREVENTION BUDGET WILL PROB FIVE PREVENTION PROCUREMENT. WE HAVE ID ME I'M HERE THOMSON REUTERS. AND WE HAVE ACCENTURE THAT HAS BEEN HELPING US TO REFINE AND REVIEW THE STANDARDS THAT BOTH PROGRAMS BOTH ID ME THOMPSON WRITERS ARE USING. THANK YOU I'M AND THEN JUST BACK TO THE CONVERSATION THAT WE WERE HAVING EARLIER ABOUT FIRST CALL RESOLUTION AND- I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF STEPS IMPLEMENTED Q. RACK FIRST CALL RESOLUTION. WHEN SO WHAT IS THE CURRENT FIGURE FOR THE NUMBER OF CALLS THAT ARE RESOLVED FIRST TRY. CAN YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT. I DO I AM I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER BUT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A SERVICE LEVEL AGREEMENT INTERNALLY TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN RESOLVE OUR FOR OURS THE FIRST CALL RESOLUTION- BY AT LEAST 60% AND EVERY ATTEMPT- WE SEEM TO BE MEETING THAT I CAN PROVIDE- ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AS FAR AS THAT THE STATISTICS ARE THE INFORMATION SHORTLY AFTER WONDERFUL THANK YOU YES IF WE CAN CAN FOLLOW UP WITH THAT THAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. AND I'M ON THE AT DEFERRED AT WORKLOAD ISSUES SO. I BELIEVE YOU SAID THAT THERE'S A PLAN TO RESOLVE AT THAT DEFERRED WORKLOAD OVER THE COURSE OF THE NEXT AS ITS BY SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AS THE AUDITOR POINTED OUT THE WINDOW FOR US TO ACTUALLY. FIVE I GUESS RESOLVE CLAIMS THE PREP FOR PAID OUT MISTAKENLY DOES NOT REMAIN OPEN FOREVER WHAT IS THE WINDOW RIGHT WHICH THAT BACKLIT THE AD DEFERRED WITH WORKLOAD HAS TO BE RESOLVED. WHAT'S THE DROPPED IT HERE. YES SO WE DO HAVE A YEAR FROM THE BENEFIT YEAR END FOR THAT COLLECTION THE OVERPAYMENT ESTABLISHMENT TO OCCUR FOR THE- FOR THE NON FOUGHT FOUGHT WE DO HAVE THREE YEARS FROM THAT BENEFIT YOUR AND FOR ANY FRAUD OR FALSE THAT IS IDENTIFIED IN THE STOP LIST. OKAY SO THAT WOULD BE THIRD READING MEANT. EITHER THIS END OF THIS YEAR FIRST SOME OF THAT SO WITH EVERY TIME AT THE END OF THIS YEAR. IT IT'S THE BENEFIT YEAR END WHICH MEANS IF- A CLAIM WAS UP THE BENEFIT YOUR BEGAN IN MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY- IT'S ONE YEAR FROM THE BENEFIT YOUR END SO IT'S MAY OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AGAINST THE CLOCK AND IT'S ONE YEAR FROM MAY OF THIS YEAR. AND CRISTINA WOULD YOU OKAY THEREFORE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OVERPAYMENT AND THE COLLECTION OF THE OVERPAYMENT. YES SO- WE HAVE THAT THE TIME FRAME IN WHICH THAT PARAMETER COMES INTO PLAY IS JUST THE ESTABLISHMENT WE CAN CONTINUE COLLECTION EFFORTS BEYOND THAT TIME FRAME I'M SO LONG AS IT'S ESTABLISHED WITHIN THAT PERIOD OF TIME. OKAY UNDERSTOOD THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT AND I'M- WE'VE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF OUR- ABILITY TO I THINK CONTINUE TO TRACK AND ADDS IT TO MONITOR THE PROGRESS THAT'S BEING MADE AND TO FULFILL OUR OUR ROLES- AS SAID. AS THE ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE AND- THE AUDIT COMMITTEE AND THE UP BUDGETS OF FOR COMMITTEE. DO YOU HAVE THAT ESTIMATES. ORTEGA'S COMMITMENTS OF WENDY'S REMAINING RECOMMENDATIONS ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETED SO I THINK THERE'S EIGHT OF TWENTY ONE THAT ARE EITHER. PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED ARE PENDING- EITHER IF YOU CAN TAKE THEM OFF NOW THAT WOULD BE GREAT IF NOT IF YOU CAN INCLUDE THAT AS A POINT OF FOLLOW UP. IN NON. THAT THE COMING DAYS. WELL AS THE BUZZER OF THE PARTRIDGE DR SAID EARLIER THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO BE MONITORED OVER TIME SO- WHICH WE WOKE UP- BUT THEY'RE GONNA BE MONITORED OVER TIME SO THE FIRSTPART OF IT IS A COMPLETE IS COMPLETE BUT THE REST HAS TO BE SOUGHT. THE DECISION OF THE STATE AUDITOR FOR WHAT. CONSTITUTES SUFFICIENT OVER TIME. THE IMPLEMENTATION. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY IN THEIR HANDS. AND I'M I'M JUST MEANING I'M LITERALLY JUST MEAN AT WHAT POINT I WANT TO KNOW LIKE FOR HIM I THINK WE'VE GOT EIGHT RECOMMENDATIONS I WANT TO KNOW HOW WHICH OF THEM ARE GONNA BE DONE IN NOVEMBER DECEMBER JANUARY IT'S SATURDAY- SO THAT WE CAN UNDERSTAND AND WHEN WE CAN SAY OKAY THIS IS DONE. AND WE'RE DONE. AND AS I SAID THAT'LL PROBABLY BE IN THE IN THE PURVIEW OF THE STATE AUDITOR. BECAUSE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO DO IT THE STATE AUDITOR HAS TO DECIDE WHEN THEY'LL BE SATISFIED. THAT WE'VE MET OF THE DEAD YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE SATISFIED THEN THAT THE- PROCEDURE IS SUFFICIENTLY IN PLACE IT WILL CONTINUE. I UNDERSTAND COMPLETELY WHY. THEY'RE DOING THAT. IF OUR EDIE WAS. RAISED IN PREVIOUSLY IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND THE THING DIDN'T GET COMPLETE OR SOMETHING WENT WRONG. ANOTHER REASON REASON TO HAVE. THEM THE NEW YORK POINTS CARD- THEN- THE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO MEET THE ARE SATISFIED OF THIS ARE. THEY FEEL THIS IS NOT PERMANENTLY IN PLACE BECAUSE AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED THERE PERMANENTLY IN PLACE. UNDERSTOOD AND CERTAINLY THE STATE AUDITOR WILL PLAY A ROLE IN DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THE CONDITIONS OF SATISFACTION HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN MAPPED. BUT MY QUESTION FOR YOU IN YOUR DEPARTMENT. IS WHAT IS YOUR TIMELINE. FOR FULLY IMPLEMENTING EACH OF THE REMAINING ITEMS THAT ARE ON THIS LIST. WE WILL MEET THE STATE AUDITOR'S DEADLINES BUT YOU'VE ALREADY MISSED THE STATE AUDITOR'S DEADLINES NO WE HAVE MET THE STATE AUDITOR'S DEADLINE IN ESTABLISHING A POLICY BUT THEY'RE NOT RISKING TO MONITOR OVER TIME THE IMPLEMENTATION WHICH I LIKE I SAID I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND. AND SOME OF THE I THINK GO THERE ARE FEW OF THESE IN THE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT ARE NOT DO YOU. THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION ASSEMBLY WOMEN PETRIE-NORRIS. THEIR TIMELINES FOR EACH OF THEIR RESPECTIVE RECOMMENDATIONS VERY. AS SOME OF THEM HAVE CSA IMPOSE DEADLINES IN WHICH THE EDB FULLY INTENDS TO MEET. AND SOME OF THEM DO NOT HAVE A CSA IMPOSE DEADLINES THEY HAD ETT IMPOSE DEADLINES. SO WE PROVIDED A DAY IN WHICH WE INTEND TO- TO FULLY MEET. SEVEN THANKS VERY OKAY AND THE DIRECTORS ABSOLUTELY CORRECT THAT. WE DON'T SEE FULL IMPLEMENTATION UNTIL WE MEET THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE CSA OPERATOR AND THAT AS BEEN A PARTNERSHIP IN A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THAT WE GREATLY APPRECIATE. AND WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO SEE THAT ALL. TWENTY ONE TWENTY THREE OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE FULLY IMPLEMENTED. OKAY AND PERHAPS I CAN THEN MAYBE I CAN TURN TO THE AUDITOR'S OFFICE WITH THE FOLLOW UP THEN ON THIS SO. IT THERE THERE ARE EIGHT OF THESE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT. ARE LISTED AS EITHER. PENDING OR PARTIALLY IMPLEMENTED. HAVE YOU ESTABLISHED UPDATED TIMELINES FOR WHEN YOU EXPECT DOES NOT SEE ANY RECOMMENDATIONS TO BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED. BOB HARRIS FOR THE STATE AUDITOR'S OFFICE SO THE TIME LINES THAT WE EXPECT HAVE NOT CHANGED OR OR MOVED- I THINK THE INFORMATION THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR AND WE CAN GO THROUGH ANY SPECIFIC ONE RIGHT NOW- EDT HAS PROVIDED AN ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE TO US FOR EACH OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT'S UP ON OUR WEBSITE RIGHT NOW I ALSO HAVE IN FRONT OF ME IF YOU HAVE A SPECIFIC QUESTION ABOUT ONE OF THEM. OR WHICHEVER ONES OF THEM I COULD I COULD GIVE YOU WHAT THEY'VE PROVIDED TO US RIGHT NOW IN TERMS OF THEIR ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE AND I DON'T THINK WE NEED TO GET TO THAT HABIT YOU'RE SAYING THERE IS IN FACT AN ESTIMATED COMPLETION DATE THAT DOES EXIST THAT THEY PROVIDED TO AFFECT UNDER FULL SO WE WILL. ADD CYCLE BACK ON ON THOSE SPECIFICS THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT AND I WOULD SAY- TO BACK TO- AT. EDT AB I THINK ON A SIMILAR VEIN WE TALKED A BIT ABOUT THE B. S. M. PROJECT AND I UNDERSTAND THAT. I WE'RE GOING TO BE TAKING AN AGILE APPROACH AND WE ARE GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTING THIS INCREMENTALLY WHICH- I THINK IS. IS EXACTLY WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING- AS THE AUDITOR HAD MENTIONED WE NEED TO MAKE SURE FOCUSING ON. THE MOST MISSION CRITICAL ELEMENTS. AND I THINK THAT AS A FOLLOW UP TO THIS HEARING. POSSIBLY EVEN AS A TOPIC OF IT AND- HAVE A NEXT HEARING. UNDERSTANDING HOW THAT BSM IS GOING TO UNFOLD. WHAT IS MISSION CRITICAL. AND WHAT CAN WE WHAT ENHANCEMENTS AND IMPROVEMENTS CAN WE EXPECT TO SEE WHEN. I THINK WOULD BE REALLY PRODUCTIVE. AGAIN NOT LOOKING FOR RESPONSE AND THAT NOW JUST FOLLOWING AT FLAGGING THAT. FOR FOLLOW UP AS WE AT. YOUR WORD. AND CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE SERVICE THAT WE'RE OFFERING. TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. I THINK IT'S AN EXCELLENT IDEA. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER SALAS NE HAD A FOLLOW UP QUESTION. THANK YOU RETURNS ONCE ASKED THE QUESTION AND SOMETHING THAT I KNOW HAS BEEN ADDRESS JUST YET. WHAT I WANTED TO ASK ABOUT AND ON ON THE ISSUE OF BANKING. RIGHT TO THE START OF THE PANDEMIC YOU KNOW EDT DEBIT CARDS ISSUED BY THE BANK OF AMERICA HAS BEEN A HEADACHE FOR. SO MANY CALIFORNIANS THE DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN CONNECTED TO BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN FRAUD AND FRUSTRATED CALIFORNIANS IS FUNDS HAVE BEEN FROZEN IN FACT THERE'S A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. REGARDING THE THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS TO BUY THEIR BENEFITS WHEN THEIR BANK OF AMERICA CARDS WERE FROZEN SO I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE RATIONALE- MADAM DIRECTOR JUST FROM EDT TO RENEW THE CONTRACT WITH BANK OF AMERICA. WAS IT WOULD CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THE DEBIT. DEBIT CARE SERVICE. OKAY THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION I BROUGHT IN A SPECIALIST IN CONTRACTS NOT TO SUPPORT WAY OUR ALREADY EXCEPTIONAL CONTRACTS STAFF. TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE BANK OF AMERICA CONTRACT- WE ARE EXTENDED IT BECAUSE WE DIDN'T WANT TO SEE A DISRUPTION IN SERVICES FOR OUR CLIENTS- I THINK THE- EARLIER IN THE HEARING SOMEBODY GAVE A NUMBER OF THE- NUMBER OF CARS THAT WERE FROZEN AND IT WAS ABOUT SIX HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ACCOUNTS DURING THE PANDEMIC. FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND OF THOSE. COULD NOT BE VERIFIED AND THEREFORE REMAIN FROZEN. A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND WERE VERIFIED AND ARE BEING PAID. WE HAVE ALL WE HAVE A MUCH. STRONGER RELATIONSHIP WITH BANK OF AMERICA RIGHT NOW AND I THINK WE EVER HAD THEY ARE THE MORE COOPERATIVE WITH US FOR THE INFORMATION THAT WE'RE SEEKING FROM THEM ABOUT THESE CARDS THE FREEZING BLOCKING A CART. AT THE SAME TIME. WE ARE PREPARING RFP. TO LET IN A FEW MONTHS FOR DIRECT DEPOSIT. DR RIGHT NOW IF SOMEBODY CATCHES WITH BANK OF AMERICA TO HAVE IF THEY HAVE AN ACCOUNT THEY HAVE THE MONEY PUT IN DIRECT DEPOSIT IN YOUR ACCOUNT OR THEY CAN HAVE CHOOSE TO HAVE. THE BANK CARD. LOADING WITH THE MONEY. THAT'S YOUR QUESTION YEAH NO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THE RELATIONSHIP AND HOW IT IMPROVES LIKE I DO APPRECIATE THAT SO DOES THAT MEAN WE WORK THROUGH THE NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT WE'VE READ AND HEARD ABOUT FROM OUR CONSTITUENTS RIGHT A LOT OF IT A LOT OF IT WAS A DEBIT CARDS- THE ADDITIONAL FEES THAT THEY HAD TO. BUT THEY HAD TO AND CURRENT BECAUSE OF THE DEBIT CARDS AND THEN YOU JUST TOUCHED UPON MY NEXT QUESTION. ABOUT DIRECT DEPOSITS ARE WE GONNA ALLOW DIRECT DEPOSIT SO THAT WE AVOID THE DEBIT CARD KIND OF FIASCO THAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH SINCE THE PANDEMIC. YES WE WILL EVENTUALLY WELL IT WILL TAKE- THIS IS NOT AN OVERNIGHT- OVER TOP OF A CHANGE. IN AND DAY OUT WELL AS I SHOULD REDEVELOPMENT ARE A FEW RIGHT NOW. THE THANK YOU TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR GIVING US THE MONEY. TO IN. ADD TO OUR I. T. SYSTEM SO THAT WE COULD ACCOMMODATE THIS CHANGE. BUT IT'S PROBABLY A COUPLE OF YEARS OR. A COUPLE OF YEARS OKAY THAT'S WHO WILL BE WAY PASSES PANDEMIC I GUESS WE'RE GETTING READY FOR THE NEXT. RECESSION BECAUSE YOU KNOW. IT'S A LITTLE FRUSTRATING BECAUSE YOU SEE LIKE PLACES LIKE MARYLAND OR MASSACHUSETTS AND WASHINGTON THESE OTHER STATES THAT I AM ABLE TO DO THE DIRECT DEPOSIT. RIGHT AWAY AND IT'S JUST YOU KNOW BEGS THE QUESTION WHY WE COULDN'T DO THAT AND STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH. AS TECHNOLOGICALLY AS ADVANCED AS WE LIKE TO SAY WE ARE WHY WE COULDN'T DO THIS FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS AND THEN ACTUALLY AVOID SOME OF THE- THE FEES FROM DEBIT CARDS AND ALL OF THE DEBIT CARD FIASCO IN ACCOUNTS BEING FROZEN NOT FROZEN IN GETTING TO THE RIGHT INDIVIDUALS- JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. YOU KNOW. I UNDERSTAND I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING I KNOW IT'S FRUSTRATING AT SOME POINT THE STATE DECIDED THE DEBIT. CARDS WOULD BE A BETTER ALTERNATIVE. FOR COMPLIMENTS. IT I THINK THAT KIND- WITH REGULAR HAS BEEN IN PLACE FOR FIVE OR SIX YEARS NOW. AND THERE WERE NOT THE SAME ISSUES THAT WE IN CHARACTER INDEPENDENT. WE ALSO DIDN'T HAVE DURING THOSE SAME YEARS CRIMINAL. RINGS ASSAULTING THE U. Y. SYSTEM HERE. RIGHT AND WHILE AND WHILE- OTHER STATES HAVE DIRECT DEPOSIT I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THAT IT DID NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT. DOING THESE OUT CONTRACTS FOR DIRECT DEPOSIT ARE COMPLICATED THEY'RE ALL KINDS OF RULES AND REGULATIONS THAT GO. AND ANDY AND THE OTHER THING IS THAT THERE ARE NOT A WHOLE LOT OF- THANKS OUT THERE THE ONE IT IS BUSINESS. YEAH YEAH WELL THAT'S JUST MY HOPE THAT SHE REACHED OUT TO PERHAPS YOUR COUNTERPARTS IN. CALIFORNIANS YOU WILL BE VERY GLAD TO HEAR THAT WE HAVE DONE ALL THOSE THINGS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER SALAS I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF FINAL QUESTIONS BUT BEFORE WE GO INTO THAT I WANNA JUST THANK THE STAFF THAT'S IN THE ROOM- FOR ALL OF THEIR SUPPORT IN PUTTING THIS BUDGET HEARING TOGETHER WE'VE GOT A LITTLE BIT OVER TIME AND SO I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PANELISTS AT EDT I KNOW WE HAVE THE OFFICE OF FINANCE AS WELL AND THE LEGISLATIVE ALL UP.

WHAT OTHER RESOURCES ARE NEEDED FOR EDT TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN MANAGE THE SPIKE AND WE'RE NOT SURE WHAT THE FUTURE IS GOING TO LEAD TO BUT THAT IS A VERY REAL SITUATION RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE TRYING TO MANAGE IN TERMS OF EFFICIENCY AND GETTING BACK TO THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. WHO RIGHTFULLY DESERVE SOME HELP. SO I GUESS I'LL I'LL TURN IT OVER TO YOU DIRECTOR SIGNS HOW ARE YOU MANAGING THE SIX MONTHS BIKE. AND THEN TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES ARE ARE NECESSARY AND NEEDED AT THIS TIME.

MONTHS THAT I HAVE BEEN DIRECTOR- YOUR ARE YOUR CRITICISMS YOUR SUGGESTIONS. APPLE ALL BEEN VERY WELCOME. SO. I WANT TO POINT OUT I THINK YOU KNOW THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE COMPLICATED AN EDT. SO ONE OF THE REASONS FOR THE SPIKE IS AT THE FEDERAL BENEFITS AND- SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON FEDERAL BENEFITS. BURKE CAME ON THEN OFF FEDERAL BENEFITS AND DURING SOME PORTION OF TIME. WORKED AND THEY- THEY GENERATED FUNDS SOME PEOPLE DID NOT. AT THE END FEDERAL BENEFITS WE ENCOURAGE THOSE PEOPLE WHO MIGHT QUALIFY TO REAPPLY- AS HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL WE HAD A COMBINATION OF PEOPLE WHO DO QUALIFY AND A LARGE PORTION PEOPLE WILL DO NOT. WE ALSO HAD A LARGE WITH A FRAUDULENT APPLICATIONS. ALL THE REST OF THAT I'M GONNA LEAVE FOR OGRESS HERE TO EXPLAIN. THE SPIKE WHEN I WENT THERE I THINK YOU HAVE TO KEEP THOSE TWO THINGS IN MIND. YES THERE WAS EDTA- TO ADD TO IT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT DIRECTOR- PREVIOUSLY- SPOKE ABOUT A CHANGING AND ADJUSTING THE WAY IN WHICH WOULD PREFER PERFORM OUR WORK. WHICH I REFERENCED IS A PART OF- THE LEGISLATION AND SOME OF THE SEASON RECOMMENDATIONS AS FAR AS THE FRAMEWORK TO ESTABLISH A RECESSION PLAN- ADJUSTING THE WAY IN WHICH WE'RE PERFORMING OUR WORK INCLUDES- SOME OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE ARE. CHANGING THE WAY IN WHICH WE- COMPLETE. ELIGIBILITY INTERVIEWS WHERE WHERE ARE CURRENTLY LOOKING AT ENSURING THAT WE CAN- TILT THE PROCESS TO ALLOW THE CUST THE CONSTITUENT TO PROVIDE THE NECESSARY INFORMATION BEFOREHAND THEREFORE ELIMINATING AN INTERVIEW- AND ALLOWING US TO MAKE A DECISION WITHOUT AVAILABLE INFORMATION- WITH THEIR RESPONSE INFORMATION. WE ARE CONTINUING TO LOOK AT- CROSS TRAINING ANY OPPORTUNITIES TO CROSS TRAIN STAFF- IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN- CONTINUE ALONG WITH THE BENDER THE CONTRACTOR VENDOR TO LIQUIDATE THIS WORKLOAD. WE ARE PUTTING OUR PROCESSES AND OUR FRAMEWORK IN PLACE TO ENSURE THAT- WE CAN PREPARE FOR THE END AND IT NEXT COMING SPIKED IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT. THE ON. HOW TO MAKE UNEMPLOYMENT ASSISTANCE PROGRAM CERTAINLY WAS A NEW ONE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THAN ANYTHING WE'VE EVER HAD IT WITHIN THE U. I. PROGRAM.
