MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT BASIC

00:11:34.427 --> 00:11:36.095
BIO IS A LITTLE BIT OF HISTORY

00:11:36.162 --> 00:11:38.297
ON OUR EVOLUTION AS A

00:11:38.364 --> 00:11:39.565
TECHNOLOGY COMPANY BECAUSE I

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:42.001
THINK IT MIRRORS. THE THREATS

00:11:42.068 --> 00:11:44.904
THAT WE'RE SEEING EMERGE OVER

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:45.438
TIME IN THE CYBER SECURITY

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:49.809
SPACE. YEARS AGO BEFORE HELLO

TO NETWORKS ENTERED THE CYBER

00:11:51.177 --> 00:11:54.113
SECURITY SPACE. CYBER SECURITY

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:56.248
WAS DELIVERED IN A SPECIFIC WAY.

00:11:56.315 --> 00:11:58.484
PRODUCTS WERE CREATED TO DEFEAT

00:11:58.551 --> 00:12:01.620
ROMERO CYBER IDENTIFIED CYBER

00:12:01.687 --> 00:12:04.123
SECURITY THREATS AND THAT WAS

00:12:04.190 --> 00:12:05.958
NO LONGER WORKING AS THE

00:12:06.025 --> 00:12:09.728
INTERNET BECAME- AND ACCESS TO.

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:11.197
THE INTERNET AND THE USE OF THE

00:12:11.263 --> 00:12:12.598
INTERNET AS A TOOL OF COMMERCE

00:12:12.665 --> 00:12:14.834
COMMUNICATION. AND

00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.736
SOCIALIZATION GROUP AND SO THE

00:12:17.803 --> 00:12:19.738
FIRST PHASE OF OUR TECHNOLOGY

00:12:19.805 --> 00:12:22.408
EVOLUTION AT PALO ALTO NETWORKS

00:12:22.475 --> 00:12:24.176
WAS THAT WE DEVELOPED A BEST IN

00:12:24.243 --> 00:12:27.113
CLASS NEXT GENERATION FIREWALL

00:12:27.179 --> 00:12:27.947
A PIECE OF TECHNOLOGY

00:12:28.013 --> 00:12:30.950
EQUIPMENT- THAT IS USED FOR

00:12:31.016 --> 00:12:32.985
NETWORK SECURITY BUSINESSES AND

00:12:33.052 --> 00:12:34.353
ENTERPRISES AND GOVERNMENT

00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:36.622
INSTITUTIONS. WHAT MADE THAT

00:12:36.689 --> 00:12:38.624
DID WHAT MADE THAT DIFFERENCE.

00:12:38.691 --> 00:12:40.459
OR REVOLUTIONARY WITH A LEAF IS

00:12:40.526 --> 00:12:41.694
THAT IT ALLOWS FOR THE

00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.796
INTEGRATION OF SECURITY

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:46.132
CAPABILITIES ACROSS THE NETWORK

00:12:46.198 --> 00:12:47.933
AS OPPOSED TO USING SPECIFIC

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.569
PRODUCTS TO DEFEAT SPECIFIC

00:12:50.636 --> 00:12:53.005
CYBER THREATS SO THAT WAS EIGHT

00:12:53.072 --> 00:12:55.207
S. EACH CHANGE IN THE WAY CYBER

00:12:55.274 --> 00:12:59.078
SECURITY. WAS IT WAS WAS

00:12:59.145 --> 00:13:00.513
APPROACHED. THE NEXT PHASE. OF

00:13:00.579 --> 00:13:03.249
MATCHED HOW THREATS AND THE USE

00:13:03.315 --> 00:13:06.018
OF THE INTERNET EVOLVED. AS YOU

00:13:06.085 --> 00:13:09.588
KNOW MUCH OF- INTERNET FACING

00:13:09.655 --> 00:13:12.358
COMMERCE AND EVEN IN CONSUMER

00:13:12.424 --> 00:13:15.127
USE IS EMPOWERED BY CLOUD

00:13:15.194 --> 00:13:17.396
NETWORKS- THESE CALL NETWORKS

00:13:17.463 --> 00:13:18.797
ARE PROVIDED BY A VARIETY OF

00:13:18.864 --> 00:13:20.666
INSTITUTIONS BUT YOU KNOW SOME

00:13:20.733 --> 00:13:23.068
OF THE MOST NOTABLE AMAZON. WEB

00:13:23.135 --> 00:13:26.005
SERVICES GOOGLE CLOUD MICROSOFT

00:13:26.071 --> 00:13:28.741
AND THERE ARE OTHER CLOUDS THAT

00:13:28.807 --> 00:13:32.311
DISTRIBUTE- COMPUTING

00:13:32.378 --> 00:13:34.847
CAPABILITY. ANY EXTRAORDINARILY

00:13:34.914 --> 00:13:37.650
EFFICIENT MANNER. WHAT NEEDED

00:13:37.716 --> 00:13:38.918
TO HAPPEN WAS IF WE WERE GOING

00:13:38.984 --> 00:13:41.987
TO DISTRIBUTE THAT- COMPUTER

00:13:42.054 --> 00:13:43.956
CAPABILITY THAT TECHNOLOGY WE

00:13:44.023 --> 00:13:46.125
NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE COULD

00:13:46.192 --> 00:13:48.794
PROTECT DISTRIBUTED FLOW OF

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.362
INFORMATION AT THE SAME TIME

00:13:50.429 --> 00:13:52.031
AND SO THE NEXT BIG PHASE OF

00:13:52.097 --> 00:13:53.566
OUR DEVELOPMENT OR TECHNOLOGY

00:13:53.632 --> 00:13:55.201
DEVELOPMENT WAS TO MATCH THE

00:13:55.267 --> 00:13:59.305
USE OF CLOUD- AS A TOOL FOR

00:13:59.371 --> 00:14:01.707
FAR- COMPUTING CAPABILITY AND

00:14:01.774 --> 00:14:04.843
TECHNOLOGY. SO NOW WE SHOULD.

00:14:04.910 --> 00:14:08.414
ARE UNIFIED WAY THE USE OF THE

00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:09.381
USED BY GOVERNMENT BY

00:14:09.448 --> 00:14:13.552
INDIVIDUALS AND BY COMPANIES.

00:14:13.619 --> 00:14:14.386
THE USE OF CLOUD NETWORKS. THE

00:14:14.453 --> 00:14:16.622
THIRD BIG M. O. EVOLUTION WHICH

00:14:16.689 --> 00:14:18.123
I THINK IS THE FRONTIER OF

00:14:18.190 --> 00:14:19.825
CYBER SECURITY AND I THINK IT'S

00:14:19.892 --> 00:14:21.293
IMPORTANT TO REALLY FOCUS ON

00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.229
THIS BECAUSE IT MATCHES UP.

00:14:23.295 --> 00:14:24.296
WITH THE EMERGING THREATS THAT

00:14:24.363 --> 00:14:27.099
WE'RE SEEING IS THE USE OF.

00:14:27.166 --> 00:14:33.872
MAPPING OKAY ALEX DESCRIBE THAT-

00:14:33.939 --> 00:14:36.875
AUTOMATED DETECTION AND SO THIS

00:14:36.942 --> 00:14:38.644
IS ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE TO

00:14:38.711 --> 00:14:41.413
HELP DETECT THREATS BEFORE THEY

00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:43.616
GET TO SOMEONE'S NETWORK AND

00:14:43.682 --> 00:14:46.051
AUTOMATION FOR YOUR SECURITY

00:14:46.118 --> 00:14:48.787
OPERATIONS THAT IS THE FRONTIER

00:14:48.854 --> 00:14:50.856
OF CYBER SECURITY AND THAT IS

00:14:50.923 --> 00:14:52.391
WHERE WE HAVEN'T WE'VE INVESTED

00:14:52.458 --> 00:14:54.026
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS JUST OVER

00:14:54.093 --> 00:14:55.961
THE PAST THREE YEARS TO BECOME

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:57.930
BEST IN CLASS IN THAT FRONT

00:14:57.997 --> 00:14:59.965
HERE. AND SO THINK ABOUT

00:15:00.032 --> 00:15:03.035
MAPPING THIS WAY YOU YOU-

00:15:03.102 --> 00:15:04.236
YOU'VE CERTAINLY HEARD OF THE

00:15:04.303 --> 00:15:05.471
INTERNET OF THINGS THIS IS THE

00:15:05.537 --> 00:15:06.772
ATTACHMENT OF BILLIONS AND

00:15:06.839 --> 00:15:09.475
BILLIONS OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF

00:15:09.541 --> 00:15:13.212
DEVICES TO BROADBAND NETWORKS

00:15:13.279 --> 00:15:14.713
EVERYTHING FROM- HEALTH

00:15:14.780 --> 00:15:16.749
DETECTOR THAT YOU MIGHT WEAR ON

00:15:16.815 --> 00:15:18.717
YOUR WRIST TO INDUSTRIAL

00:15:18.784 --> 00:15:23.188
CONTROL SYSTEM ON A FREIGHTER

00:15:23.255 --> 00:15:23.789
SHIP OUT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

00:15:23.856 --> 00:15:28.160
OCEAN. BECAUSE NOW BILLIONS OF.

00:15:28.227 --> 00:15:30.262
DEVICES HANG OFF THE INTERNET

00:15:30.329 --> 00:15:31.864
WE HAVE TO GET VERY SMART ABOUT

00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:33.666
THE WAY YOU DO TO PROTECT THEM

00:15:33.732 --> 00:15:35.334
BECAUSE EACH ONE OF THEM.

00:15:35.401 --> 00:15:37.469
PRESENTS ARE ACTUALLY IS THE

00:15:37.536 --> 00:15:39.738
POINT OF VULNERABILITY IN THE

00:15:39.805 --> 00:15:42.675
SYSTEM. SO WHAT WE BELIEVE

00:15:42.741 --> 00:15:44.710
STRONGLY IN IS YOU HAVE TO KNOW

00:15:44.777 --> 00:15:46.945
YOUR VULNERABILITIES ARE BEFORE

00:15:47.012 --> 00:15:48.814
YOU CAN PROTECT THAT AND SO WE

00:15:48.881 --> 00:15:49.481
ALONG WITH OTHERS IN OUR

00:15:49.548 --> 00:15:51.317
INDUSTRY. HAVE DEVELOPED

00:15:51.383 --> 00:15:53.319
MAPPING TECHNOLOGY TO HELP YOU

00:15:53.385 --> 00:15:55.321
FIND WHERE YOUR VULNERABILITIES

00:15:55.387 --> 00:15:57.790
ARE AND THEN DEPLOY DETECTION

00:15:57.856 --> 00:16:00.192
AND DEFEAT CAPABILITIES TO USE

00:16:00.259 --> 00:16:02.027
SMART AND DDOT ARTIFICIAL

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:03.062
INTELLIGENCE ANOTHER SMART

00:16:03.128 --> 00:16:04.863
TECHNOLOGIES TO DEFEAT THE

00:16:04.930 --> 00:16:07.066
VULNERABILITIES BEFORE THEY GET

00:16:07.132 --> 00:16:07.633
TO THOSE WILL BE CALL IN

00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:09.401
POINTS. THAT IS THE NEXT

00:16:09.468 --> 00:16:10.969
FRONTIER SO THAT IS THE

00:16:11.036 --> 00:16:14.106
EVOLUTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IN

00:16:14.173 --> 00:16:14.673
MATCHES THE EVOLUTION OF THE

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:15.541
THREAT. SO LET ME BRIEFLY GO

00:16:15.607 --> 00:16:18.010
OVER STRESS WHAT ARE THE SOME

00:16:18.077 --> 00:16:19.678
OF THE BIGGEST THREATS AND

00:16:19.745 --> 00:16:20.245
EMERGING THREATS THAT WE'RE

00:16:20.312 --> 00:16:23.382
SEEING- ONE ALREADY ALLUDED TO

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:26.719
RANSOMWARE. I THINK IT IS. THE

00:16:26.785 --> 00:16:28.187
BEST WAY TO DESCRIBE RANSOMWARE

00:16:28.253 --> 00:16:30.422
IS THAT IS THAT HE IS A SCOURGE

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:31.824
USED TO ACTUALLY BE A BIT OF A

00:16:31.890 --> 00:16:34.626
HOBBY. WHERE THE AVERAGE RANSOM

00:16:34.693 --> 00:16:35.661
WAS TWO OR THREE HUNDRED

00:16:35.728 --> 00:16:37.563
DOLLARS. IN THE FIRST SIX

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:39.231
MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE BY

00:16:39.298 --> 00:16:40.466
CONTRAST THE AVERAGE RANSOM

00:16:40.532 --> 00:16:42.468
DEMAND ROSE FIVE HUNDRED

00:16:42.534 --> 00:16:45.904
EIGHTEEN PERCENT. TO FIVE POINT

00:16:45.971 --> 00:16:46.672
THREE MILLION DOLLARS. THE

00:16:46.739 --> 00:16:50.242
AVERAGE RANSOM IS NOW OVER FIVE

00:16:50.309 --> 00:16:51.310
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS.

00:16:51.377 --> 00:16:54.780
SO IT IS IT IS NOT IT IS THIS

00:16:54.847 --> 00:16:57.049
IS WHY I CALLED A SEARCH. ONE

00:16:57.116 --> 00:16:58.283
OF THE MOST NOTABLE RANSOMWARE

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.318
ATTACKS OF THIS YEAR WAS THE

00:16:59.385 --> 00:17:01.286
COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK. THAT

00:17:01.353 --> 00:17:03.989
DISRUPTED OIL PRODUCTION- FOR A

00:17:04.056 --> 00:17:05.758
SYSTEM THAT PROVIDED NEARLY 45%

00:17:05.824 --> 00:17:08.060
OF THE FUEL PROVIDED THE WAY TO

00:17:08.127 --> 00:17:10.596
THE EAST COAST. A SECOND MAJOR

00:17:10.662 --> 00:17:11.930
EMERGING THREAT RELATES TO

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:13.198
INDUSTRIAL CONTROL CONTROL

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:15.467
SYSTEMS SO ABSOLUTE AS I

00:17:15.534 --> 00:17:16.802
ALLUDED TO A MOMENT AGO THESE

00:17:16.869 --> 00:17:18.470
ARE THE SYSTEMS PHYSICAL

00:17:18.537 --> 00:17:21.039
SYSTEMS LIKE PUMPS. THAT UNDER

00:17:21.106 --> 00:17:22.174
TO UNDERPIN CRITICAL

00:17:22.241 --> 00:17:24.977
INFRASTRUCTURE LIKE A WATER

00:17:25.043 --> 00:17:25.544
SYSTEM OR ELECTRIC ELECTRIC

00:17:25.611 --> 00:17:27.179
SYSTEM. THESE INDUSTRIAL

00:17:27.246 --> 00:17:29.381
CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE A NEW

00:17:29.448 --> 00:17:31.750
SIGNIFICANT EMERGING THREATS IN

00:17:31.817 --> 00:17:33.352
THE CYBER SECURITY SPACE A

00:17:33.419 --> 00:17:34.987
RECENT EXAMPLE- CENTER

00:17:35.053 --> 00:17:36.889
REFERRED. TO IT ALREADY IS THIS

00:17:36.955 --> 00:17:38.090
OLD SMART WATER TREATMENT

00:17:38.157 --> 00:17:39.691
FACILITY BREACH IN FLORIDA

00:17:39.758 --> 00:17:41.293
EARLIER THIS YEAR WHERE TAX

00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:43.395
GAIN ACCESS TO SYSTEMS THAT

00:17:43.462 --> 00:17:44.763
CONTROL THE MIXTURE OF SODIUM

00:17:44.830 --> 00:17:47.366
HYDROXIDE IN THEWATER SUPPLY.

00:17:47.433 --> 00:17:49.067
AND THEY WERE ABLE TO MAKE IT

00:17:49.134 --> 00:17:50.269
ONE HUNDRED TIMES HIGHER THAN

00:17:50.335 --> 00:17:52.204
NORMAL. ESSENTIALLY CREATING

00:17:52.271 --> 00:17:53.872
THE POSSIBILITY THIS ACTUALLY

00:17:53.939 --> 00:17:55.941
POISONING THE WATER. THAT'S

00:17:56.008 --> 00:17:57.075
BECAUSE THESE INDUSTRIAL

00:17:57.142 --> 00:17:58.343
CONTROL SYSTEMS ARE ARE

00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:00.179
MANIFOLD AND YOU HAVE TO KEEP

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:03.482
UP WITH THEM YOU HAVE TO

00:18:03.549 --> 00:18:04.116
PROTECT ESPECIALLY ALL OF THEM.

00:18:04.183 --> 00:18:05.551
THE OUR SUPPLY CHAIN ATTACKS

00:18:05.617 --> 00:18:07.886
THESE ATTACKS THAT SEEK TO

00:18:07.953 --> 00:18:08.987
DAMAGE AN ORGANIZATION BY

00:18:09.054 --> 00:18:11.023
TARGETING THE LESS SECURE

00:18:11.089 --> 00:18:13.859
ELEMENTS IN ITS SUPPLY CHAIN

00:18:13.926 --> 00:18:18.664
SO. ENTERPRISE MIGHT AT BEST IN

00:18:18.730 --> 00:18:19.898
CLASS CYBER SECURITY CAPABILITY.

00:18:19.965 --> 00:18:23.435
WHAT IF ITS SUPPLY CHAIN HAS

00:18:23.502 --> 00:18:26.772
IDENTIFIABLE- BONNEVILLE

00:18:26.839 --> 00:18:28.874
RESENTED CYBER ATTACKERS ARE

00:18:28.941 --> 00:18:31.210
LIKELY TO FIND IT AND EXPLOIT

00:18:31.276 --> 00:18:32.911
THE MOST NOTABLE SUPPLY JACK'S

00:18:32.978 --> 00:18:34.947
SPY TRAINING TAX OF LATE WAS

00:18:35.013 --> 00:18:36.882
THE US SOLAR WINDS TACK SURE

00:18:36.949 --> 00:18:38.851
YOU'VE ALL HEARD THAT- THIS IS

00:18:38.917 --> 00:18:40.519
OUR ATTACKERS MOST LIKELY FROM

00:18:40.586 --> 00:18:43.355
RUSSIA RABAL TO COMPROMISE-

00:18:43.422 --> 00:18:44.323
WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN A SUMMER

00:18:44.389 --> 00:18:46.258
ROUTINE SOFTWARE UPDATE FROM A

00:18:46.325 --> 00:18:48.760
TRUSTED SOURCE. WELL SAID THIS

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.562
OFFER WAS DOWNLOADED AND

00:18:50.629 --> 00:18:51.730
EXECUTED AS FOLLOWS THE

00:18:51.797 --> 00:18:55.467
NETWORKS. THAT DOWNLOADED THE

00:18:55.534 --> 00:18:57.269
SOFTWARE. AND FOURTH ALL WE THE

00:18:57.336 --> 00:18:58.670
CAN IMPORTANT THREAT THAT WE

00:18:58.737 --> 00:19:00.305
FACE IS SOMETHING WE CALL ON

00:19:00.372 --> 00:19:02.574
OUR ABILITY EXPLOITATION. THAT

00:19:02.641 --> 00:19:03.842
BASICALLY IS A FANCY WAY OF

00:19:03.909 --> 00:19:05.811
SAYING SOFTWARE CAN CHANGE WE

00:19:05.878 --> 00:19:07.513
CAN ASSESS SOME OF THOSE

00:19:07.579 --> 00:19:09.214
WEAKNESSES ARE KNOWN SOME OF

00:19:09.281 --> 00:19:11.116
THEM ARE NOT REAL. AND IT

00:19:11.183 --> 00:19:15.020
TANKERS SEEK THEM OUT. AND THEY

00:19:15.087 --> 00:19:16.655
REALLY WHAT THEY DO. IS THEY

00:19:16.722 --> 00:19:19.291
FIND VULNERABILITIES BECAUSE

00:19:19.358 --> 00:19:21.126
USERS OF THE SOFTWARE HAVE NOT

00:19:21.193 --> 00:19:23.495
DONE THIS SIMPLE THING OF

00:19:23.562 --> 00:19:26.131
PATCHING SOFTWARE PATCHES THAT

00:19:26.198 --> 00:19:28.000
HAVE ALREADY BEEN PUSHED OUT.

00:19:28.066 --> 00:19:29.401
SO WE CALL THESE UNMITIGATED

00:19:29.468 --> 00:19:31.136
VULNERABILITIES IN SOFTWARE AND

00:19:31.203 --> 00:19:33.906
THEY POSE A SERIOUS THREAT. TO

00:19:33.972 --> 00:19:35.507
OUR INFRASTRUCTURE JUST THIS

00:19:35.574 --> 00:19:38.610
WEEK. ACTUALLY JUST ONE WEEK

00:19:38.677 --> 00:19:42.147
AGO I BELIEVE- THE GUARDIAN US

00:19:42.214 --> 00:19:44.816
GOVERNMENT THIS IS A THE- CYBER

00:19:44.883 --> 00:19:46.084
SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE

00:19:46.151 --> 00:19:48.687
SECURITY AGENCY HOSTED A SET OF

00:19:48.754 --> 00:19:50.622
KNOWN VULNERABILITIES AND

00:19:50.689 --> 00:19:52.591
DIRECTED FEDERAL AGENCIES TO

00:19:52.658 --> 00:19:55.060
CLOSE THEM THROUGH AVAILABLE

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:57.262
SOFTWARE PATCHES. ENTERPRISES

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:59.264
HOWEVER ARE NOT GOOD ENOUGH AND

00:19:59.331 --> 00:20:00.465
OFTEN DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT

00:20:00.532 --> 00:20:02.334
PROCESSES AND HYGIENE BREAK IN

00:20:02.401 --> 00:20:03.769
PLACE TO ENSURE THAT

00:20:03.835 --> 00:20:07.205
VULNERABILITIES ARE CLOSED EVEN

00:20:07.272 --> 00:20:07.806
WHEN PATCHES ARE AVAILABLE. SO

00:20:07.873 --> 00:20:09.474
FINALLY JUST A FEW THOUGHTS ON

00:20:09.541 --> 00:20:11.376
WHAT POLICY MAKERS CAN DO OR

00:20:11.443 --> 00:20:13.278
WHAT THEY MIGHT CONSIDER- MIGHT

00:20:13.345 --> 00:20:15.180
CONSIDER AS WE FACE THESE

00:20:15.247 --> 00:20:17.883
EMERGING THREATS. FIRST OF ALL

00:20:17.950 --> 00:20:19.685
WE ENCOURAGE POLICYMAKERS TO

00:20:19.751 --> 00:20:22.821
INCENTIVIZE THE ADOPTION OF

00:20:22.888 --> 00:20:23.322
WHAT WE CALL A SECTORAL

00:20:23.388 --> 00:20:25.223
FRAMEWORKS. THE NATIONAL

00:20:25.290 --> 00:20:26.391
INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND

00:20:26.458 --> 00:20:28.393
TECHNOLOGY FOR INSTANCE HAS

00:20:28.460 --> 00:20:30.829
ADOPTED A WELL KNOWN CYBER

00:20:30.896 --> 00:20:32.864
SECURITY FRAMEWORK. THERE ARE

00:20:32.931 --> 00:20:35.167
SIMILAR FRAMEWORKS. THESE ARE

00:20:35.233 --> 00:20:37.869
GUIDEPOSTS EASIER THESE ARE

00:20:37.936 --> 00:20:40.372
PLAIN BOX IF YOU WILL FOR

00:20:40.439 --> 00:20:42.274
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF EXISTING

00:20:42.341 --> 00:20:44.409
TECHNOLOGY TO SECURITY. TO

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:45.644
SECURE YOUR NETWORKS WHETHER

00:20:45.711 --> 00:20:46.478
YOU'RE IN A GOVERNMENTAL

00:20:46.545 --> 00:20:48.380
INSTITUTION OR OTHER FORM OF

00:20:48.447 --> 00:20:50.849
ENTERPRISE. SECOND WE THINK

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:52.484
THAT IN THE RANSOMWARE SPACE

00:20:52.551 --> 00:20:57.856
THERE SHOULD BE SMART FORMS OF

00:20:57.923 --> 00:20:58.690
REQUIRED INCIDENT REPORTING. TO

00:20:58.757 --> 00:21:00.926
OFTEN- IF YOU CAN BELIEVE IT OR

00:21:00.993 --> 00:21:02.861
NOT THESE RANSOMWARE ATTACKS

00:21:02.928 --> 00:21:05.931
COMING GO. RANSOM IS PAID

00:21:05.998 --> 00:21:08.200
VULNERABILITIES ARE KNOWN BUT

00:21:08.266 --> 00:21:09.368
THERE ISN'T ENOUGH.

00:21:09.434 --> 00:21:11.937
COLLABORATIVE COMMUNICATION

00:21:12.004 --> 00:21:14.139
BETWEEN THE VICTIM. AND THEY

00:21:14.206 --> 00:21:16.174
TRULY ARE VICTIMS AND LAW

00:21:16.241 --> 00:21:16.842
ENFORCEMENT ANOTHER

00:21:16.908 --> 00:21:19.444
GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS THIRD

00:21:19.511 --> 00:21:21.113
KNOWING THE THREATS GET

00:21:21.179 --> 00:21:24.583
INFORMED- MANY MOST MOST LARGE

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:25.350
GOVERNMENT INSTITUTIONS ALL

00:21:25.417 --> 00:21:26.952
HAVE A SECURITY TEAM THE

00:21:27.019 --> 00:21:28.553
LEADERS OF THOSE INSTITUTIONS

00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:29.855
SHOULD BE TALKING THAT SECURITY

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:31.757
TEAM. AND THE SECURITY TEAM

00:21:31.823 --> 00:21:32.758
SHOULD BE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF

00:21:32.824 --> 00:21:34.626
EXPERTISE OUTSIDE OF THEIR

00:21:34.693 --> 00:21:37.562
ROUND. FOR INSTANCE JUST TODAY

00:21:37.629 --> 00:21:39.331
ARE KIND OF PALO ALTO NETWORKS

00:21:39.398 --> 00:21:42.100
ARE UNIT FORTY TWO- RESEARCH

00:21:42.167 --> 00:21:43.935
TEAM PUBLISHED A REPORT

CYBERSECURITY HAS GONE FROM A

00:24:20.659 --> 00:24:23.361
RELATIVELY BACKWARD ISSUE TO

00:24:23.428 --> 00:24:24.863
TOP NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT.

00:24:24.930 --> 00:24:26.832
THIS MOVE ALSO DEPENDING ON

00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:28.600
WHERE I USED TO WORK DIRECTLY

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:30.502

IMPACTS OF DATA. BREACH OR THE

00:24:40.645 --> 00:24:41.580
IMPACTS OF RENTAL. TAYLOR EVEN

00:24:41.646 --> 00:24:43.515
OF HOSPITAL TURNING AWAY.

CYBER. IN SOME CASES THIS IS

00:24:47.185 --> 00:24:48.954
EVEN LED TO INSTANCES OF DEATH

00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.655
OR BODILY HARM AND PEOPLE ARE

00:24:50.722 --> 00:24:52.791
TAKING NOTICE REMARKABLY IN A

00:24:52.858 --> 00:24:54.292
RECENT NATIONWIDE POLL OF

SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:24:58.930 --> 00:25:00.398
WELL. THAT'S A TOP HIGH

00:25:00.465 --> 00:25:01.566
PRIORITY FOR THE BUILD BACK

00:25:01.633 --> 00:25:03.335
BETTER PROPOSAL BUT FULLY ONE

00:25:03.401 --> 00:25:05.170
QUARTER PLACING IN THE TOP

00:25:05.237 --> 00:25:06.071

LIKE. THIS IMPACTS ALL OF US

00:25:08.807 --> 00:25:12.377
AND SO I THINK THE SOLUTIONS.

00:25:12.444 --> 00:25:12.978
WILL ALSO REQUIRE ALL OF US.

00:25:13.044 --> 00:25:14.746
BATTERIES HER NUMBER HACKER

00:25:14.813 --> 00:25:15.947
GAINED ACCESS TO THE COMPUTER

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.849

SYSTEM. THAT SAME ACCESS WILL

00:25:27.926 --> 00:25:29.694
BE A SUCCESSFUL PERSON IN TOWN

CASES EVEN VISIBLE DAMAGE. BUT

00:25:37.936 --> 00:25:39.004
THE CHALLENGE FOR DEFENDERS AS

00:25:39.070 --> 00:25:40.272
YOU TRY TO PREVENT HACKERS FROM

POSSIBLE. FORTUNATELY THERE ARE

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:49.814
SOME PRACTICES CAN BE IN

CYBER HYGIENE. WELL THERE'S NO

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.085
WAY TO GUARANTEE PREVENTION

00:25:54.152 --> 00:25:55.287
ACTIONS CAN BE TAKEN THAT YOU

OFFER YOUR INSIGHTS- RIGHT NOW

00:32:02.086 --> 00:32:05.256

PRIVATE BUSINESS TO DISCLOSE TO

00:32:08.359 --> 00:32:10.328
THE FEDERAL AUTHORITIES. ARE

00:32:10.395 --> 00:32:12.030
THAT THEY HAVE BEEN HACKED OR

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:14.899
HAVE PAID OUT OF SOME SORT OF

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:21.172

00:32:25.810 --> 00:32:27.578
QUICK ANSWER THEY MIGHT MAYBE

00:32:27.645 --> 00:32:29.614
CAN SUPPLEMENT AND THEN- THE

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:32.216
SHORT ANSWER IS I DON'T KNOW

00:32:32.283 --> 00:32:33.584
THAT I COULD GIVE YOU A-

00:32:33.651 --> 00:32:37.288
ABSOLUTELY- UNIFORM ANSWER FOR

00:32:37.355 --> 00:32:39.624
EVERY SITUATION. BUT GENERALLY

00:32:39.691 --> 00:32:41.426
SPEAKING THE ANSWER IS IT

00:32:41.492 --> 00:32:44.128
DEPENDS ON THE TYPE OF DATA

00:32:44.195 --> 00:32:46.864
THAT WAS IF ANY DATA WAS

00:32:46.931 --> 00:32:51.235
BREACHED. AND EXFILTRATE IT

00:32:51.302 --> 00:32:51.869
SUCH THAT DATA BREACH LAWS ARE

00:32:51.936 --> 00:32:54.539
IMPLICATED. THEY ARE RANSOMWARE

00:32:54.605 --> 00:32:57.108
ATTACKS FOR INSTANCE WHERE THAT

00:32:57.175 --> 00:32:58.643
IS NOT IMPLICATED BECAUSE- THE

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:02.013
RANSOM IS PAID IN FULL AND THE

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:04.916
ATTACK IS- REVERSED FOR THE

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.184
SYSTEMS ARE MADE AVAILABLE AND

00:33:06.250 --> 00:33:07.552
THERE'S NO EXFILTRATION OF

00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:11.022
DATA. SO RIGHT NOW WHEN THAT

00:33:11.089 --> 00:33:12.990
HAPPENS THERE IS NO UNIFORM

00:33:13.057 --> 00:33:15.059
LEGAL SCHEME THAT REQUIRES

00:33:15.126 --> 00:33:17.128

AND BE ENGAGED WITH ONE ANOTHER

00:33:25.837 --> 00:33:26.838
SO THAT THEY CAN DETERMINE

00:33:26.904 --> 00:33:28.172
WHETHER OR NOT THERE IS A

00:33:28.239 --> 00:33:30.274
PATTERN OF OR THERE MIGHT BE. A

00:33:30.341 --> 00:33:33.344
COMMON SOURCE- THAT IS- SERVING

00:33:33.411 --> 00:33:36.714
AS THE ACTOR. IN YOUR OPINION

00:33:36.781 --> 00:33:37.515
DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE.

00:33:37.582 --> 00:33:39.951
FAVORABLE FOR AT THE FEDERAL

00:33:41.319 --> 00:33:46.290
LEVEL. FOR THERE TO BE- LAW

00:33:46.357 --> 00:33:48.993

00:33:49.060 --> 00:33:51.796
ILLEGAL TO EITHER PAY. R.

00:34:03.608 --> 00:34:05.877
SCENARIOS DO YOU THINK THAT.

00:34:05.943 --> 00:34:08.646

GIVE YOU A YEAH SO EARLIER THIS

00:34:10.882 --> 00:34:13.651
YEAR- IF PALO ALTO NETWORKS CO

DEFEATING RANSOMWARE. AND WE'RE

00:34:26.831 --> 00:34:27.899
ALIGNED WITH WHERE THAT TASK

00:34:27.965 --> 00:34:29.133
FORCE CAME OUT THAT ONE OF THE

00:34:29.200 --> 00:34:31.302
THORNIEST TOPICS THAT THE TASK

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:33.671
FORCE CONFRONTED WHAT WAS THIS

00:34:33.738 --> 00:34:36.240
TOPIC OF SHOULD THERE BE A

PROHIBITION. ON PAYING RANSOM

00:34:40.044 --> 00:34:41.846
IN THE SHORT ANSWER IS IT WOULD

00:34:41.913 --> 00:34:43.815
BE WE'VE WE'VE WHERE THE TASK

00:34:43.881 --> 00:34:45.650
FORCE CAME DOWN IS IT WILL BE

00:34:45.716 --> 00:34:47.385
VERY DIFFICULT AND POTENTIALLY

00:34:47.452 --> 00:34:49.287
COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO IMPLEMENT

00:34:49.353 --> 00:34:51.823
THAT RULE MAINLY BECAUSE YOU

00:34:51.889 --> 00:34:54.492
WOULD FORCE. INSTITUTIONS IT

00:34:54.559 --> 00:34:56.227
MIGHT NOT BE READY OR CAPABLE

00:34:56.294 --> 00:34:57.328
OF DEFEATING RANSOMWARE

00:34:57.395 --> 00:34:59.697
RANSOMWARE ATTACK IS TO BE

00:34:59.764 --> 00:35:03.367
LEFT- ESSENTIALLY ON GUARD AND

00:35:03.434 --> 00:35:06.137
DEFENSELESS AND SO IT'S HARD TO

00:35:06.204 --> 00:35:08.072
SAY THAT IN EVERY CIRCUMSTANCE

00:35:08.139 --> 00:35:10.007
YOU WOULD WANT TO DISABLE AN

00:35:10.074 --> 00:35:11.609

RANSOMWARE THE REASON WHY THE

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:16.514

CRITICAL ENTITIES HEALTH CARE

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.197
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND

00:35:33.264 --> 00:35:34.265
THIS MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:36.901
IMPOSE. EIGHT ABSOLUTE BAN ON

00:35:36.968 --> 00:35:39.003
RANSOMWARE PAYMENTS WE THINK

00:35:39.070 --> 00:35:40.705
THE BETTER THING IS TO GET

00:35:40.771 --> 00:35:44.308
PEOPLE PREPARED. USE TECHNOLOGY

00:35:44.375 --> 00:35:45.676
USE GOOD SYSTEMS USED TO TYPE

00:35:45.743 --> 00:35:47.645

00:35:47.712 --> 00:35:49.947
ABOUT TO PREPARE SO DID YOU

00:35:50.014 --> 00:35:51.415
DON'T FACE A HOBSON'S CHOICE

00:35:51.482 --> 00:35:52.316
AND FINALLY THE ANSWER YOUR

00:35:52.383 --> 00:35:54.719
OTHER QUESTION WE DO BELIEVE

00:35:54.785 --> 00:35:56.554
THAT APPROPRIATE INCIDENT

00:35:56.621 --> 00:35:58.923
RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS ARE WE

00:35:58.990 --> 00:36:00.224
THAT THAT THAT SHOULD BE

00:36:00.291 --> 00:36:01.626
REQUIRED AND THERE ARE LAWS

00:36:01.692 --> 00:36:03.160
BEING DISCUSSED IN THE U. S.

00:36:03.227 --> 00:36:05.263
CONGRESS RIGHT NOW. ON THAT

00:36:05.329 --> 00:36:12.136
TOPIC. AND WE SUPPORT THAT NO

00:36:12.203 --> 00:36:13.371
NO CLUE THE PYRAMID COLLEAGUES

00:36:13.437 --> 00:36:14.805

00:36:15.473 --> 00:36:16.507
SOME MINISTRIES IS THIS IS BUT

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:17.141
IT'S STILL SOME SORT OF CALLOUS

00:36:17.208 --> 00:36:20.177
SO I SECURE. AGENCY EITHER AS A

00:36:20.244 --> 00:36:22.446
STANDALONE OR A- SUPPORTED

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:25.249

PROPERLY STAFF CERTAINLY

00:36:28.185 --> 00:36:30.421
ELIGIBLE FOR FEDERAL GRANTS. I

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:32.390
THINK WOULD BE A SMART MOVE

00:36:32.456 --> 00:36:35.159
FORWARD- MY LAST QUESTION IS DO

00:36:35.226 --> 00:36:36.027
YOU THINK THAT THERE SHOULD BE

00:36:36.093 --> 00:36:40.965
AN- ENHANCED PENALTIES. HI IF

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:41.566
THERE ARE ATTACKS ON CRITICAL

INFRASTRUCTURE. WHETHER IT BE

00:36:44.068 --> 00:36:45.002
AT THE STATE LEVEL OR THE

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:47.305
FEDERAL LEVEL THAT IF YOU DO

00:36:47.371 --> 00:36:50.341
MOVE INTO THE AREA OF- HEALTH

00:36:50.408 --> 00:36:52.910
CARE OR GREED OR ENERGY- THAT

00:36:52.977 --> 00:36:54.579
THOSE ARE AREAS AND I KNOW MY

00:36:54.645 --> 00:36:56.147
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT- THE

00:36:56.213 --> 00:36:58.783
PRESIDENT BIDEN WAS PROPOSING A

00:36:58.849 --> 00:37:01.118
HANDS OFF POLICY WITH- WITH

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:03.421
RUSSIA THAT THERE'S A TOLERABLE

00:37:03.487 --> 00:37:06.324
AMOUNT OF. A BREACH THAT

00:37:06.390 --> 00:37:08.693
AMERICANS THIS CAN SUSTAIN BUT

00:37:08.759 --> 00:37:10.962
IF YOU GO AFTER THESE AREAS

00:37:11.028 --> 00:37:12.496
THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED A

00:37:12.563 --> 00:37:14.432
OVERT AND PROVOCATIVE MOVE

00:37:14.498 --> 00:37:16.901
NECESSITATING A- AT THE FEDERAL

00:37:16.968 --> 00:37:18.836

PENALTIES FOR ATTACKS THAT HIT

00:37:24.141 --> 00:37:26.777

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:40.858
ELEVATE. THEM TO MATCH. AS I

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:41.625
MENTIONED ON THIS HAPPENED

00:42:41.692 --> 00:42:43.327
RECENTLY I THINK WE WILL BE

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:45.663
ABLE TO FIND A LOT MORE ROOM-

00:42:45.729 --> 00:42:46.964
WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO BRING ALL

00:42:47.031 --> 00:42:48.098
OF THEM TO JUSTICE BUT I DO

00:42:48.165 --> 00:42:49.600
THINK WE WILL. HAVE THE TOOLS

00:42:49.667 --> 00:42:51.101
TO BE BACK WE MAY BE ABLE TO DO

00:42:51.168 --> 00:42:52.603
THINGS DIPLOMATICALLY WORK WITH

00:42:52.670 --> 00:42:54.238
INTERNATIONAL PARTNERS AND

00:42:54.305 --> 00:42:56.106
AGAIN. WE SEE A LOT MORE THAT.

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:57.474
THE SAMPLE THAT WE WILL BE AND

00:42:57.541 --> 00:42:59.543
I THINK IT'LL BE- I THINK IT

00:42:59.610 --> 00:43:01.178
WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE SO THAT'S-

00:43:01.245 --> 00:43:01.879
THAT'S GREAT YOUR SECOND

00:43:01.946 --> 00:43:04.114
QUESTION IS A GREAT ONE AS

00:43:04.181 --> 00:43:06.617
WELL- I WOULD ADD ONE OTHER

00:43:06.684 --> 00:43:08.452
LEVEL OF NEW WANTS TO THAT- I

00:43:08.519 --> 00:43:10.521
JUST RECEIVED ONE OF THESE. YOU

00:43:10.587 --> 00:43:12.923
KNOW FAKE. CREDIT CARD- EMAILS

00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.592
THE OTHER DAY ON AND- IT

00:43:15.659 --> 00:43:18.529
pADDRESS IS BECAUSE THE ATTACKER

00:43:18.595 --> 00:43:22.366
HAD- ALL. ACCESS THE SCHOOL

00:43:22.433 --> 00:43:24.535
SYSTEM IN SOUTH DAKOTA- AND

00:43:24.601 --> 00:43:27.871
WAS. USING THEIR SYSTEM. AS A

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:30.140
LAUNCHING POINT TO SEND. OUR

00:43:30.207 --> 00:43:32.042
STATE EMAILS LOOKING FOR ARE

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:33.277

AND THEN GIVE THEM MY BANK

00:43:34.278 --> 00:43:35.546
ACCOUNT INFORMATION. SO IT'S

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:37.414
NOT JUST THE BANK IN THE AMOUNT

00:43:37.481 --> 00:43:38.482
OF TIME I HAVE HEARD THE VICTIM

00:43:38.549 --> 00:43:46.724

POSTURE UNDER WHAT'S GOING ON

00:44:00.070 --> 00:44:04.942
THINGS AND PUMP. THAT'S WHY I

00:44:05.009 --> 00:44:05.542
THINK WE NEED TO KIND OF LOOK

00:44:05.609 --> 00:44:06.744

JUST A FEW QUICK ANSWER FOR.

00:44:14.551 --> 00:44:15.319
FIRST OF ALL I AGREE IT IS IT

00:44:15.386 --> 00:44:17.821
IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO IDENTIFY.

00:44:17.888 --> 00:44:19.390
THE ATTACKERS AND THEREFORE

00:44:19.456 --> 00:44:23.327
PROSECUTIONS ARE A REAL. BUT WE

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:26.563
ARE SEEING SOME SUCCESS IN THE-

00:44:26.630 --> 00:44:28.699
DESTRUCTION OF THEIR NETWORKS

00:44:28.766 --> 00:44:31.201
SHE'S RIGHT. AS YOU MAY HAVE

00:44:31.268 --> 00:44:34.138
SEEN A FAIR A LARGE PERCENTAGE

00:44:34.204 --> 00:44:35.572
OF THE RANSOM PAID IN THE

00:44:35.639 --> 00:44:38.442
COLONIAL PIPELINE ATTACK WAS

00:44:38.509 --> 00:44:41.612
RECOVERED AND THAT'S BECAUSE

00:44:41.678 --> 00:44:44.014
LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- THE- ON

00:44:44.081 --> 00:44:45.649
THE BROADER LONG FORCE FEDERAL

00:44:45.716 --> 00:44:48.285
LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY. USED

00:44:48.352 --> 00:44:50.187

DISRUPTED THE FINANCIAL SUPPLY

00:44:57.628 --> 00:44:59.496
CHAIN IF YOU WILL THAT THE

00:44:59.563 --> 00:45:01.065
ATTACKER WAS USING I THINK

00:45:01.131 --> 00:45:02.099
WE'RE GOING TO SEE MORE OF

00:45:02.166 --> 00:45:05.035
THAT. BEFORE WE SEE MORE

00:45:05.102 --> 00:45:08.772
PROSECUTIONS. AS FOR THE- WHAT

00:45:08.839 --> 00:45:10.641

00:45:16.914 --> 00:45:18.882
WHICH IS COLLABORATION AND PART

OR AND OUR PARTNERSHIP. WE'VE

00:45:21.051 --> 00:45:23.687
SEEN A GREAT DEAL OF BENEFIT

00:45:23.754 --> 00:45:25.622
FROM A PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:45:25.689 --> 00:45:28.325
COOPERATION AND COLLABORATION

00:45:28.392 --> 00:45:29.827
IN DEFEATING CYBER SECURITY OR

00:45:29.893 --> 00:45:31.195
AT LEAST PREPARING

00:45:31.261 --> 00:45:33.030
ORGANIZATIONS TO GET THEIR

00:45:33.097 --> 00:45:34.465

AND OTHER AGENCIES OF THE

00:45:44.741 --> 00:45:47.111
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHEN- YOU

00:45:47.177 --> 00:45:48.979
RECALL EARLIER SHE THIS YEAR

00:45:49.046 --> 00:45:51.148
THERE WAS A- VULNERABILITY

00:45:51.215 --> 00:45:52.916
IDENTIFIED WITH MICROSOFT

00:45:52.983 --> 00:45:54.985
EXCHANGE SERVERS. WE WERE ABLE

00:45:55.052 --> 00:45:58.188
TO HELP IDENTIFY WHERE THE-

00:45:58.255 --> 00:46:01.058
VULNERABLE SOFTWARE INSTANCES

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:03.827
WERE. AND WE DID SO IN A

00:46:03.894 --> 00:46:05.562
LEGALLY COMPLIANT FASHION AND

00:46:05.629 --> 00:46:07.164
THEN WE'RE ABLE IN A LEGALLY

00:46:07.231 --> 00:46:09.633
COMPLIANT FASHION TO SHARE THAT

00:46:09.700 --> 00:46:10.200
WITH THE RIGHT GOVERNMENTAL

00:46:10.267 --> 00:46:12.970
AGENCIES. AND THEY WERE ABLE TO

00:46:13.036 --> 00:46:14.805
COMMUNICATE THAT YOU DISTRIBUTE

00:46:14.872 --> 00:46:16.473
FASHION TO POTENTIALLY

00:46:16.540 --> 00:46:19.109
VULNERABLE INSTITUTIONS AND

00:46:19.176 --> 00:46:20.611
USERS THAT WAS A GOOD

00:46:20.677 --> 00:46:21.712
COLLABORATION I THINK THERE

00:46:21.778 --> 00:46:23.347
NEEDS TO BE MORE THAT I THINK

00:46:23.413 --> 00:46:24.882
THERE'S DEFINITELY A ROLE FOR

00:46:24.948 --> 00:46:26.583
STATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN THOSE

00:46:26.650 --> 00:46:28.152
COLLABORATIONS FINALLY YOUR

00:46:28.218 --> 00:46:29.853
POINT ABOUT. A PHISHING SCAMS

00:46:29.920 --> 00:46:31.021
IN THE ROLE WHAT WHAT

00:46:31.088 --> 00:46:34.191
RESPONSIBILITY TO DO- DO THE DO

00:46:34.258 --> 00:46:36.460
THE TWO COMPANIES HAVE I THINK

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:38.595
ANY CONSUMER FACING COMPANY

00:46:38.662 --> 00:46:40.264
NEEDS TO HAVE GOOD HYGIENE

00:46:40.330 --> 00:46:41.965

00:46:42.032 --> 00:46:43.901
BANKS HAVE. EXCELLENT HYGIENE

00:46:43.967 --> 00:46:47.971
PRACTICES THERE'S ALSO A HUGE

00:46:48.038 --> 00:46:48.939
EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT. I THINK

00:46:49.006 --> 00:46:50.040
THE CONSUMER FACING

00:46:50.107 --> 00:46:51.175
ORGANISATIONS DO A LOT OF

00:46:51.241 --> 00:46:53.076
EDUCATING THEIR CONSUMER BASE

00:46:53.143 --> 00:46:54.378
TO SAY THESE ARE THE TYPES OF

00:46:54.444 --> 00:46:56.079

COLLABORATION AND DATA SHARING-

00:49:58.028 --> 00:49:58.562
AND THAT KIND OF STUFF WILL

00:49:58.628 --> 00:50:00.230
ALWAYS BE REALLY HELPFUL IT

00:50:00.297 --> 00:50:03.166
CANNOT BE UNDERSTATED- AND THEN

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:05.369
YOU CAN ALSO REQUIRE STATE. AND

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:06.103
LOCAL ENTITIES TO MEET A

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:08.939
CERTAIN LEVEL OF HYGIENE- YOUR

00:50:09.005 --> 00:50:22.386
SECURITY STANDARDS- THEMSELVES-

00:50:22.452 --> 00:50:22.986

LEGAL- OR MAY. AGAIN LEADING

00:50:39.302 --> 00:50:40.871
THE IN THINGS LIKE THAT RUGE.

00:50:40.937 --> 00:50:44.441

COOPERATION COLLABORATION AND

00:50:52.048 --> 00:50:52.616
THIS IS WHAT'S THIS

00:50:52.682 --> 00:50:58.088

COLLABORATION COOPERATION- BUT

00:51:05.061 --> 00:51:06.630
I'M ALSO HEARING THAT. WHEN

00:51:06.696 --> 00:51:09.366
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW TO BEEF

00:51:09.433 --> 00:51:11.735
UP CYBERSECURITY PROTOCOLS-

00:51:11.802 --> 00:51:12.636
THERETHERE'S A LOT OF

00:51:12.702 --> 00:51:14.604
DIFFERENT PROCESSES THAT WE

00:51:14.671 --> 00:51:15.839
WOULD WANT THE PRIVATE SECTOR

00:51:15.906 --> 00:51:16.940
TO TOP WHETHER THAT SOME OF THE

00:51:17.007 --> 00:51:19.242
WAR GAME TYPE SELF ASSESSMENTS

00:51:19.309 --> 00:51:22.112

00:51:29.853 --> 00:51:31.588
GOVERNMENT POLICIES STATE

00:51:31.655 --> 00:51:32.956
GOVERNMENT POLICY THAT CAN HELP

00:51:33.023 --> 00:51:34.791
ENCOURAGE TAKE UP. OF SOME OF

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:36.026
THESE BASIC CYBERSECURITY

00:51:36.092 --> 00:51:36.993
PRACTICES THAT WE KNOW ARE

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.695
LACKING ACROSS LARGE SWATHS OF

00:51:38.762 --> 00:51:40.063
THE PRIVATE SECTOR I'M NOT SURE

00:51:40.130 --> 00:51:42.532
IF YOU MR MCNERNEY- YOU KNOW

00:51:42.599 --> 00:51:43.900
CAN WE SEE INSURANCE USING A

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:45.502
LOT OF PLACES AS A WAY TO TRY

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:47.404
TO INCENTIVIZE A PRUDENT

00:51:47.471 --> 00:51:48.371
PRACTICES ARE BEST. BEST

00:51:48.438 --> 00:51:50.207
PRACTICES WHETHER THAT'S CAR

00:51:50.273 --> 00:51:51.174
INSURANCE HEALTH INSURANCE OR

OTHERWISE- WE KNOW WE GET

00:51:52.642 --> 00:51:54.478
PREMIUMS FOR YOU KNOW- GETTING

00:51:54.544 --> 00:51:56.213
IN ACCIDENTS OR OR TRAFFIC

00:51:56.279 --> 00:51:58.048
INCIDENTS OR WHATNOT. DO YOU

00:51:58.114 --> 00:51:59.483
SEE A SIMILAR ROLE FOR CYBER

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:00.617
INSURANCE AS MAYBE BEING A

00:52:00.684 --> 00:52:03.687
PATHWAY TO- INCURSION PRIVATE

00:52:03.753 --> 00:52:05.288
COMPANIES TO ADOPT BEST

00:52:05.355 --> 00:52:07.424
CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES. AND IF

00:52:07.491 --> 00:52:09.159
SO- MAYBE COLLABORATE ALSO

00:52:09.226 --> 00:52:09.960
ELABORATE ON WHAT THE

00:52:10.026 --> 00:52:11.528
GOVERNMENT CAN DO TO ENCOURAGE

00:52:11.595 --> 00:52:14.965
MORE CYBER INSURANCE BECAUSE

00:52:15.031 --> 00:52:15.632
THIS IS SUCH A NASCENT INDUSTRY.

00:52:15.699 --> 00:52:17.601
YEAH THANK YOU SENATOR- I DO

00:52:17.667 --> 00:52:19.369
FEEL THAT WAY IF I CONTINUE TO

00:52:19.436 --> 00:52:21.438
BE TO BE DIRECT- I DON'T KNOW

00:52:21.505 --> 00:52:22.405
THAT THE CYBER INSURANCE

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:23.440
INDUSTRY HAS BEEN ALL THAT

00:52:23.507 --> 00:52:25.509
HELPFUL IN THIS REGARD YES-

00:52:25.575 --> 00:52:26.710
IT'S RELATIVELY IMMATURE

00:52:26.776 --> 00:52:29.546
INDUSTRY- AND SPOTTING

00:52:29.613 --> 00:52:32.048
RANSOMWARE- WHICH IS CALLED A

00:52:32.115 --> 00:52:33.517
SURGE EARLIER TODAY I THINK IS

00:52:33.583 --> 00:52:35.185
EXACTLY RIGHT. THAT IS CHANGE

00:52:35.252 --> 00:52:37.120
THE MARKET I THINK IT IS AND IT

00:52:37.187 --> 00:52:38.855
SHOULD NOT BE MARKET IS-

00:52:38.922 --> 00:52:40.724
BECAUSE INSURERS- TO KIND OF

00:52:40.790 --> 00:52:42.259
WAKE UP TO THE CHALLENGES IN A

00:52:42.325 --> 00:52:43.593
WAY THAT MAYBE DIDN'T BEFORE.

00:52:43.660 --> 00:52:44.728
BECAUSE THE LOSSES ARE SO

00:52:44.794 --> 00:52:46.229
TREMENDOUS RIGHT AND REALIZED

00:52:46.296 --> 00:52:48.331
IMMEDIATELY IN A VERY LARGE AND

00:52:48.398 --> 00:52:49.599
SO WE'RE STARTING TO SEE A

00:52:49.666 --> 00:52:51.601
CONTRACTION IN THE MARKET- A

00:52:51.668 --> 00:52:53.203
LESSENING OF SUPPLY OR DEMAND

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:55.372
IS GOING UP- AND THAT IS

00:52:55.438 --> 00:52:57.440
ACTUALLY A LEADING- YOU KNOW

00:52:57.507 --> 00:52:58.708
THOSE OF US THAT ARE THAT ARE

00:52:58.775 --> 00:52:59.676
CONTINUING TO OFFER CYBER

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:01.545
INSURANCE. I HAVE A BIGGER HAND

00:53:01.611 --> 00:53:03.747
IN IN WHAT WE ARE YOU KNOW KIND

00:53:03.813 --> 00:53:05.482
OF REQUIRE OF OUR CUSTOMERS.

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:07.484
AND OUR VISION I DO THINK THE

00:53:07.551 --> 00:53:08.685
MARKET IS HEADED THIS WAY IS A

00:53:08.752 --> 00:53:10.353
LOT MORE LIKE YOU DESCRIBE.

00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:12.989
WITH DRIVERS INSURANCE OR OR

00:53:13.056 --> 00:53:15.158
LIFE INSURANCE WERE YOU CAN'T

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:17.193
ENGAGE IN RISKY BEHAVIOR

00:53:17.260 --> 00:53:18.929
EXPECTS. TO GET LIFE INSURANCE

00:53:18.995 --> 00:53:21.631
YOU CAN'T GO YOU KNOW- LIGHTING

00:53:21.698 --> 00:53:22.966
AND EXPECT THAT LIFE LIFE

00:53:23.033 --> 00:53:25.101
INSURANCE RIGHT- CYBERSECURITY

00:53:25.168 --> 00:53:27.637
INSURANCE IS HEADED THAT WAY-

00:53:27.704 --> 00:53:29.839
LAST YEAR- WAS COMPLETELY

00:53:29.906 --> 00:53:31.808
DIFFERENT STORY I'VE- BEEN

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:32.442
TELLING YOU SOMETHING DIFFERENT

00:53:32.509 --> 00:53:33.643
AND THIS WAS LAST YEAR. BUT

00:53:33.710 --> 00:53:35.812
THIS YEAR LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IF

00:53:35.879 --> 00:53:36.479
YOU KNOW AS I MENTIONED MY

00:53:36.546 --> 00:53:46.156
TESTIMONY YOU DON'T HAVE MULTI.

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:46.690
FACTOR AUTHENTICATION YOU

00:53:46.756 --> 00:53:47.524
PROBABLY CAN'T- THAT IS NEW

00:53:47.591 --> 00:53:49.292
DATA ON THIS AND I THAT TREND I

00:53:49.359 --> 00:53:50.760
THINK HE'S GOING TO- AND SO

00:53:50.827 --> 00:53:52.562
THIS THAT IS MOST HELPFUL TO US.

00:53:52.629 --> 00:53:54.864
THE SHARES WERE. IN DAY. SO TO

00:53:54.931 --> 00:53:55.498
THE EXTENT THAT THE- THE STATE

AND- HELP US- YOU KNOW JACK'S.

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:00.804
TO WHAT CONTROLS ARE THE MOST

00:54:00.870 --> 00:54:02.072
IMPORTANT TO PREVENT ANY

00:54:02.138 --> 00:54:04.641
BREACH- WHAT DID DAMAGES LOOK

00:54:04.708 --> 00:54:06.409
LIKE. THOSE KINDS OF THINGS

00:54:06.476 --> 00:54:08.745
THAT WILL HELP US DETERMINE-

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:09.746
YOU KNOW WHAT OUR UNDERWRITING

00:54:09.813 --> 00:54:12.415
STANDARDS SHE BASED ON THOSE

00:54:12.482 --> 00:54:14.050
THINGS ARE REALLY GOING TO- AND

00:54:14.117 --> 00:54:16.419
THEN YOU KNOW AGAIN AS I

00:54:16.486 --> 00:54:18.288
MENTIONED. ARE REQUIRING. OR

00:54:18.355 --> 00:54:19.456
REQUESTING A WHATEVER YOU WANT

00:54:19.522 --> 00:54:21.658
TO DO THAT THAT- STATE AND

00:54:21.725 --> 00:54:22.759
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE AN

00:54:22.826 --> 00:54:24.461
ELEVATED- CYBER SECURITY LEVEL

00:54:24.527 --> 00:54:26.363
OF HYGIENE BEFORE BY THE WAY

00:54:26.429 --> 00:54:27.697
MANY MUNICIPALITIES ARE

00:54:27.764 --> 00:54:29.633
QUALIFIED FOR CYBER INSURANCE.

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:31.434
ON IT VERY HARD TO GET IT-

00:54:31.501 --> 00:54:32.435
BECAUSE THE CONTROLS ARE SO

00:54:32.502 --> 00:54:35.105
POOR RIGHT SO- YOU KNOW HAVING

00:54:35.171 --> 00:54:37.140
THEM I HAVE THE RESOURCES AS

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.141
WELL AS THE UNDERSTANDING OF

00:54:38.208 --> 00:54:39.142
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO

00:54:39.209 --> 00:54:40.410
INCREASE OUR CYBERSECURITY

00:54:40.477 --> 00:54:42.245
POSTURE. ALL RIGHTS ARE AND

00:54:42.312 --> 00:54:43.213
HAVE YOU BEEN IN DISCUSSIONS

00:54:43.279 --> 00:54:44.314
WITH COMMISSIONER LAWRENCE

00:54:44.381 --> 00:54:46.783
OFFICE AROUND- WHAT WE CAN DO

00:54:46.850 --> 00:54:52.255
TO. BEEF UP AND. AND REALLY

00:54:52.322 --> 00:54:52.822
EXPAND US EVER INSURANCE. US

00:54:52.889 --> 00:54:53.456
SENATOR WE HAVE NOT YET OTHERS

00:54:53.523 --> 00:54:55.392
MAY- I KNOW ARE ON OUR LIST.

00:54:55.458 --> 00:54:57.961
BUT- OUR COMPANY'S NOT. BAD AND-

00:54:58.028 --> 00:54:58.828
I WANT TO TAKE THIS QUESTION

00:54:58.895 --> 00:55:00.196
YOU MISTER BYRD IN A SLIGHTLY

00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:01.464
DIFFERENT WAY. YOU KNOW WHAT I

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:03.333
THINK AGAIN TO THE POINT OF NOT

00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.501
JUST COLLABORATION COOPERATION

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:05.869
BUT BEGINNING FOR THE PRIVATE

00:55:05.935 --> 00:55:08.271
SECTOR TO. YOU JUST A TOP BASIC

00:55:08.338 --> 00:55:09.539
CYBERSECURITY PROTOCOLS IT'S

00:55:09.606 --> 00:55:11.141
GREAT TO HAVE STANDARDS BUT- I

00:55:11.207 --> 00:55:13.076
THINK AN IMPORTANT. NEXT STEP

00:55:13.143 --> 00:55:14.477
IS TO ENSURE THAT R TRY TO

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:16.846
INCENTIVIZE- PRIVATE COMPANIES

00:55:16.913 --> 00:55:18.415
TO TAKE UP THOSE MEASURES AND I

00:55:18.481 --> 00:55:19.683
GUESS. YOU KNOW WHEN I THINK OF

00:55:19.749 --> 00:55:21.317
POLICY WE THINK OF CARROTS AND

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:23.186
STICKS. WHAT THE CARROTS AND

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.087
STICKS YOU THINK MIGHT BE

00:55:24.154 --> 00:55:25.255
HELPFUL COMING FROM THE STATE

00:55:25.321 --> 00:55:26.956
GOVERNMENT THAT MIGHT INCREASE

00:55:27.023 --> 00:55:30.260
ADOPTION OF CYBER SECURITY BEST

00:55:30.326 --> 00:55:33.530
PRACTICES. WELL FIRST I THINK

00:55:33.596 --> 00:55:36.733
THAT- I'LL FOCUS PRIMARILY ON.

00:55:36.800 --> 00:55:40.270
CARROTS. ONE ONE THING IS OUR

00:55:40.336 --> 00:55:42.739
TOP DOWN LEADERSHIP. I THINK

00:55:42.806 --> 00:55:45.909
THAT. ABOUT ONE ONE VALUABLE

00:55:45.975 --> 00:55:47.377
ACTIVITY THAT STATE GOVERNMENT

00:55:47.444 --> 00:55:50.146
CAN DO. IS ENSURE THAT ITS OWN

00:55:50.213 --> 00:55:52.582
HOUSES IN ORDER FROM A CYBER

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:54.250
SECURITY STANDPOINT- THAT

00:55:54.317 --> 00:55:55.652
DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN

00:55:55.719 --> 00:55:57.721
SPENDING AND- YOU KNOW.

00:55:57.787 --> 00:56:00.190
LAVISHLY ON EVERY SINGLE PIECE

00:56:00.256 --> 00:56:02.125
OF NEW TYPE OF TECHNOLOGY. BUT

00:56:02.192 --> 00:56:04.461
THERE ARE SOME THESE FRAMEWORKS

00:56:04.527 --> 00:56:04.994
ARE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT I

00:56:05.061 --> 00:56:07.731
THINK. EVALUATING THEM AND

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:12.001
ENSURING WITH YOUR OWN- CYBER

00:56:12.068 --> 00:56:14.370
PROFESSIONALS THAT YOU ARE JUST

00:56:14.437 --> 00:56:17.741
HOLDING- CYBER SECURITY

00:56:17.807 --> 00:56:19.542
PROTECTION ON YOUR EXISTING IT

00:56:19.609 --> 00:56:21.277
SYSTEMS BUT YOU ARE REALLY

00:56:21.344 --> 00:56:22.946
MAKING IT AN INTEGRAL PART OF

00:56:23.012 --> 00:56:26.282
YOUR PROCUREMENT PLANS AND YOUR

00:56:26.349 --> 00:56:27.283
TECHNOLOGY ROADMAPS. SIX

00:56:27.350 --> 00:56:29.452
PURSUANT TO ALREADY ESTABLISHED

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:30.553
FRAMEWORKS THAT WE KNOW CAN

00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:32.322
WORK I THINK IT'S A IT'S A

00:56:32.388 --> 00:56:34.891
GREAT WAY TO INCENTIVIZE GOOD

00:56:34.958 --> 00:56:38.561
BEHAVIOR. TO I THINK YOU HAVE

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:39.996
TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE RESOURCE

00:56:40.063 --> 00:56:41.164
CONSTRAINTS AND FIGURE OUT

00:56:41.231 --> 00:56:43.099
WHERE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS

00:56:43.166 --> 00:56:45.668
EXIST WHY WHY AREN'T CERTAIN

00:56:45.735 --> 00:56:48.938
BUSINESSES- ASSESSING OUR OR

00:56:49.005 --> 00:56:51.007
EMPLOYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND

00:56:51.074 --> 00:56:52.509
FIGURING OUT WHERE THOSE

00:56:52.575 --> 00:56:55.111
RESOURCE HOLES ARE- IF THERE IS

00:56:55.178 --> 00:56:56.579
A SIGNIFICANT OR LEGITIMATE

00:56:56.646 --> 00:56:58.481
RESOURCE PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW

00:56:58.548 --> 00:57:01.284
WHETHER A MANDATE ALONE WOULD

00:57:01.351 --> 00:57:04.587
SOLVE IT AND SO- I GUESS THAT

00:57:04.654 --> 00:57:05.789
LEADS TO THE THIRD POINT WHICH

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:07.323
IS YOU CAN'T PROTECT SOMETHING

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:07.924
YOU DON'T KNOW NEEDS

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:11.261
PROTECTING. SO I THINK THAT-

00:57:11.327 --> 00:57:13.563
FIGURING OUT YOU KNOW WAYS TO

00:57:13.630 --> 00:57:15.265
USE TECHNOLOGY TO IDENTIFY

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:16.833
WHERE THE MOST VULNERABLE

00:57:16.900 --> 00:57:19.068
SYSTEMS ARE- AND THEN

00:57:19.135 --> 00:57:21.371
PRIORITIZING THOSE SYSTEMS IS A

00:57:21.437 --> 00:57:23.773
GOOD WAY TO AT LEAST MARSHAL

00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:26.609
RESOURCES- AND THEN FINALLY I

00:57:26.676 --> 00:57:30.146
WOULD FOCUS ON- PARTNER- I

00:57:30.213 --> 00:57:32.782
THINK THAT A- COLLABORATION

00:57:32.849 --> 00:57:34.818
THAT INVOLVES. THE UNIQUE.

00:57:34.884 --> 00:57:37.220
CAPABILITIES AS PARTICULARLY

00:57:37.287 --> 00:57:38.588
LAW ENFORCEMENT ENFORCEMENT

00:57:38.655 --> 00:57:40.523
CAPABILITIES OF GOVERNMENT WITH

00:57:40.590 --> 00:57:42.091
THE KNOWLEDGE OF CYBER SECURITY

00:57:42.158 --> 00:57:44.327
COMPANIES HAVE- TO UNDERSTAND

00:57:44.394 --> 00:57:47.397
EMERGING THREATS AND THE LAW

00:57:47.463 --> 00:57:52.235
THE- VISIBILITY THAT. PRIVATE

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.803
INDUSTRY CAN US INTO THE- THEIR

00:57:53.870 --> 00:57:55.004
THEIR RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS I

00:57:55.071 --> 00:57:57.273
THINK A PARTNERSHIP IN THAT

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:57.841
AREA IS THE BEST WAY TO MOVE

00:57:57.907 --> 00:58:01.711
FORWARD. GOT IT THANK YOU

00:58:01.778 --> 00:58:04.414
MISTER BYRD- SO MOVING TO THE I

00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.649
GUESS PUBLIC SECTOR- YOU KNOW

00:58:06.716 --> 00:58:07.884
WHEN WE THINK ABOUT GOVERNMENT

00:58:07.951 --> 00:58:09.152
PROTECTING ITS OWN HOUSES YOU

00:58:09.219 --> 00:58:11.054
PUT MISTER BYRD WHAT ARE SOME

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.822
OF THE BEST PRACTICES THAT WE

00:58:12.889 --> 00:58:14.724
SEEN FROM OTHER COUNTRIES OR

00:58:14.791 --> 00:58:15.758
OTHER JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS

00:58:15.825 --> 00:58:17.493
STATES LIKE. ARE THEIR MODELS

00:58:17.560 --> 00:58:19.195
THAT WE CAN LOOK TO THAT THAT

00:58:19.262 --> 00:58:21.064
MIGHT HELP INFORM US AS WE

00:58:21.130 --> 00:58:21.664
PROCEED DOWN THE LINE HERE IN

00:58:21.731 --> 00:58:26.736
CALIFORNIA. FRIDAY YES. SIR

00:58:26.803 --> 00:58:31.074
WOULD YOU MISTER BYRD. I JUST

00:58:31.140 --> 00:58:32.876
HAVE TO THINK ABOUT SPECIFIC

00:58:32.942 --> 00:58:37.447
INSTANCES OF- I WOULD I WOULD

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:40.783
SAY THE MOST NOTABLE THAT COMES

00:58:40.850 --> 00:58:42.952
TO MIND IS SMETHING THAT WE'RE

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:44.587
FAMILIAR WITH AND THAT IT

00:58:44.654 --> 00:58:45.889
PROBABLY DESERVES A LITTLE BIT

00:58:45.955 --> 00:58:47.857
OF STUDY IS THAT THERE IS A-

00:58:47.924 --> 00:58:50.026
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP IN

00:58:50.093 --> 00:58:53.229
THE NORTH JUST IN NORTH DAKOTA

00:58:53.296 --> 00:58:55.498
DESIGNED TO INTEGRATE- THE

00:58:55.565 --> 00:58:56.933
CYBER SECURITY CAPABILITIES

00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.002
ACROSS AGENCIES ACROSS ACROSS

00:58:59.068 --> 00:59:01.070
INSTITUTIONS AND IT'S DONE IN A

00:59:01.137 --> 00:59:02.605
PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP. I

00:59:02.672 --> 00:59:05.275
WOULD SAY THAT IS A GOOD MODEL

00:59:05.341 --> 00:59:08.311
FOR HOW A STATE STATE ACTORS

00:59:08.378 --> 00:59:10.546
CAN INCENTIVIZE GOOD BEHAVIOR

00:59:10.613 --> 00:59:12.348
AND THEN HELPED PUSH RESOURCES

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:14.684
OUT TO WHERE IT'S NEEDED MOST-

00:59:14.751 --> 00:59:18.354
ALSO I CAN I THINK WE CAN'T.

00:59:18.421 --> 00:59:19.956
IGNORE IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

00:59:20.023 --> 00:59:22.792
INCENTIVES HOW TO HOW TO INSURE

00:59:22.859 --> 00:59:24.427
THAT CYBER DEFENSES ARE PUSHED

00:59:24.494 --> 00:59:26.162
OUT MORE HOLISTICALLY TO WHERE

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:28.298
THEY'RE NEEDED THEN THE

00:59:28.364 --> 00:59:30.667
RECENTLY ENACTED OR ARE SOON TO

00:59:30.733 --> 00:59:35.638
BE SIGNED- INFRASTRUCTURE

00:59:35.705 --> 00:59:36.372
LEGISLATION. I HAVE SEVERAL

00:59:36.439 --> 00:59:38.374
INTERESTING. REGARDING CYPRUS I

00:59:38.441 --> 00:59:40.576
THINK THE TOTAL AMOUNT-

00:59:40.643 --> 00:59:42.612
APPROPRIATED FOR CYBER SECURITY

00:59:42.679 --> 00:59:44.447
IS ROUGHLY TWO BILLION DOLLARS.

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.382
BUT THEY ARE THERE IS A STATE

00:59:46.449 --> 00:59:49.919
OR LOCAL PROGRAM GRANT PROGRAM

00:59:49.986 --> 00:59:52.155
ESTABLISHED BY THAT LAW. WE

00:59:52.221 --> 00:59:52.922
THINK IT COULD BE A REALLY

00:59:52.989 --> 00:59:56.225
COMPELLING- ELEMENT OF THAT LAW

00:59:56.292 --> 00:59:58.161
TO OVERCOME RESOURCE

00:59:58.227 --> 01:00:00.563
CONSTRAINTS- AT THE STATE BUT

01:00:00.630 --> 01:00:01.898
ALSO PARTICULARLY AT THE LOCAL

01:00:01.965 --> 01:00:03.967
LEVEL SO THAT GRANT PROGRAM IS

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:06.536
SOMETHING THAT. I THINK EVERY

01:00:06.602 --> 01:00:08.404
OF STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:00:08.471 --> 01:00:11.975
INSTITUTIONS SHOULD PROBABLY

01:00:12.041 --> 01:00:14.277
GET- INFORMED ABOUT. AND I

01:00:14.344 --> 01:00:16.179
SHOULD PROBABLY RELYING ON

01:00:16.245 --> 01:00:18.214
CYBER SECURITY EXPERTS TO HELP

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:20.450
IDENTIFY THE BEST WAY TO MAKE A

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:22.986
GRANT REQUEST. MENTAL HEALTH

01:00:23.052 --> 01:00:24.821
CENTER HOW TO ADD TO THAT

01:00:24.887 --> 01:00:26.456
REALLY QUICKLY I'M A BIG FAN OF

01:00:26.522 --> 01:00:29.926
EXERCISING- AND SO- YOU KNOW TO

01:00:29.993 --> 01:00:31.060
THE EXTENT YOU'RE ABLE TO USE

01:00:31.127 --> 01:00:32.428
POWER WE ASKED OF THE NATIONAL

01:00:32.495 --> 01:00:35.698
GUARD. TO GO THROUGH CYBER

01:00:35.765 --> 01:00:36.232
INCIDENT I KNOW I THINK I

01:00:36.299 --> 01:00:38.835
ALWAYS BEEN A VERY BIG ONE I'LL

01:00:38.901 --> 01:00:41.104
GO THROUGH THAT AND IT. WILL

01:00:41.170 --> 01:00:42.905
BECOME APPARENT RIGHT YOU MAY

01:00:42.972 --> 01:00:44.907
NOT BE JUST TECHNOLOGICAL MEDIA

01:00:44.974 --> 01:00:46.476
PEOPLE YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH OF

01:00:46.542 --> 01:00:47.310
THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT

01:00:47.377 --> 01:00:48.644
PLACES MAYBE THEY DON'T HAVE

01:00:48.711 --> 01:00:50.380
THE RIGHT TRAINING OR COULD BE

01:00:50.446 --> 01:00:52.715
PROCESSES RIGHT- SO I WOULD SAY

01:00:52.782 --> 01:00:54.217
PEOPLE PROCESS AND TECHNOLOGY

01:00:54.283 --> 01:00:57.120
AND DO A- DO A COUPLE EXERCISES

01:00:57.186 --> 01:00:58.554
AND SEE WHAT SHAKES OUT AND

01:00:58.621 --> 01:01:04.360
THEN I THINK HE'S- GOING. TO

01:01:04.427 --> 01:01:05.194
COME UP WILL BECOME VERY. GREAT

01:01:05.261 --> 01:01:05.762
THANK YOU I'M JUST TWO MORE

01:01:05.828 --> 01:01:07.663
QUESTIONS- FIRST- GOING. TO THE

01:01:07.730 --> 01:01:09.399
QUESTION A STANDALONE AGENCY-

01:01:09.465 --> 01:01:11.000
YEAH WE KNOW THAT THERE IS THE

01:01:11.067 --> 01:01:13.069
WORKING GROUP ON ACCOUNT- YES-

01:01:13.136 --> 01:01:14.971
BUT- WHAT WOULD YOU SEE IS THE

01:01:15.038 --> 01:01:16.706
KEY ATTRIBUTES AND RESOURCES

01:01:16.773 --> 01:01:18.741
AND OTHER CHARACTERISTICS. IF

01:01:18.808 --> 01:01:20.143
WE WERE TO TRY TO CREATE AN

01:01:20.209 --> 01:01:21.611
EFFECTIVE AND ROBUST.

01:01:21.677 --> 01:01:22.845
STANDALONE AGENCY WHAT WOULD

01:01:22.912 --> 01:01:23.646
THAT LOOK LIKE FROM YOUR

01:01:23.713 --> 01:01:26.416
PERSPECTIVE- AND YOU KNOW

01:01:26.482 --> 01:01:27.183
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO ADAPT TO

01:01:27.250 --> 01:01:30.420
ONGOING- YOU KNOW DEVELOPING-

01:01:30.486 --> 01:01:32.588
TRANSFORMING THREATS WHAT. WHAT

01:01:32.655 --> 01:01:35.425
ARE THE CHARACTERISTICS THAT WE

01:01:35.491 --> 01:01:36.059
NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT FOR A

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.094
STANDALONE AGENTS. I'LL START

01:01:38.161 --> 01:01:40.396
WITH YOU MR MCNERNEY. THANK YOU

SOME LESSONS MAYBE FROM FROM

01:01:43.533 --> 01:01:44.934
THE FEDERAL EXPERIENCE HERE

01:01:45.001 --> 01:01:47.203
IT'S A REALLY TOUGH QUESTION-

01:01:47.270 --> 01:01:48.371
CYBER SECURITY IS VERY COST

01:01:48.438 --> 01:01:50.907
CUTTING- YOUNG CALLOW YES HAS A

01:01:50.973 --> 01:01:53.076
TREMENDOUS- PART OF THIS AS I

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:54.510
MENTIONED THE NATIONAL GUARD

01:01:54.577 --> 01:01:57.080

EXPECTED TO TAKE LESSONS FROM.

01:02:02.385 --> 01:02:02.885
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WITH

01:02:02.952 --> 01:02:05.021
ADAM HOW'RE I NEED TO SEE LIKE

01:02:05.088 --> 01:02:10.193
SEA SALT- AND GIVEN IT. WE YOU

01:02:10.259 --> 01:02:12.061
HAVE MORE ABOUT IBM HOW TO

01:02:12.128 --> 01:02:16.065
SEVERAL. ONE OF THE- THAT SPACE

01:02:16.132 --> 01:02:17.467
WORKS AND ALL OTHER THEIR THEIR

01:02:17.533 --> 01:02:19.135
SCIENCE YOUR REQUIREMENTS. YEAH

01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.571
I LOVE THE MODEL OF THIS ARE WE

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:23.706
HAVE A NEW STANDARD COMMERCE-

01:02:23.773 --> 01:02:25.174
THAT WORKS CLOSELY WITH THE

01:02:25.241 --> 01:02:26.809
PRIVATE SECTOR TO COLLECT DATA

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.911
ANALYZE DATA- AND PUT OUT

01:02:28.978 --> 01:02:30.480
STANDARDS. AND THEN FINALLY YOU

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:31.481
KNOW WE'RE SEEING RIGHT NOW AN

01:02:31.547 --> 01:02:33.182
EXPERIMENT WITH A NEW NATIONAL

01:02:33.249 --> 01:02:34.217
CYBER RECORD THAT IS HAPPENING

01:02:34.283 --> 01:02:36.652
RIGHT- SOMEONE HAS A YEAR TO

01:02:36.719 --> 01:02:38.821
THE PRESIDENT. OUGHT TO HELP-

01:02:38.888 --> 01:02:39.822
YOU KNOW SHOW THAT THIS IS

01:02:39.889 --> 01:02:41.824
REALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE- AND THE

01:02:41.891 --> 01:02:43.359
DRIVE DOWN DECISIONS ARE YOU

01:02:43.426 --> 01:02:44.627
FROM THE TOP ALL THE WAY ON

01:02:44.694 --> 01:02:46.596
DOWN SO. I THINK ANY ONE OF

01:02:46.662 --> 01:02:47.763
THOSE THINGS MAYBE ALL THOSE

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:48.965
COULD BE CERTAIN FOR CALIFORNIA

01:02:49.031 --> 01:02:50.366
CONSIDER GANGS IT'S SUCH A

01:02:50.433 --> 01:02:52.635
CROSSCUTTING ISSUE- EFFECTS SO

01:02:52.702 --> 01:02:59.308
MANY DIFFERENT AGENCIES.

01:02:59.375 --> 01:02:59.876
PRIVATE SECTOR AND PEOPLE AS

01:02:59.942 --> 01:03:01.644
WELL. MR THOUGHTS. REALLY QUICK

01:03:01.711 --> 01:03:02.712
NUMBER ONE I THINK YOU'VE GOT

01:03:02.778 --> 01:03:04.981
TO YOU KNOW THIS INSTANCE-

01:03:05.047 --> 01:03:07.783
AGENCY TO HAVE BUILT IN

01:03:07.850 --> 01:03:10.253
SKEPTICISM MEANING IT'S IT

01:03:10.319 --> 01:03:12.522
NEEDS ITS OWN RED TEAM SO THAT

01:03:12.588 --> 01:03:15.091
IS CONTINUALLY EVALUATING THE

01:03:15.158 --> 01:03:16.926
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

01:03:16.993 --> 01:03:19.962
OF THE AGENCY THAT'S BECAUSE

01:03:20.029 --> 01:03:21.797
THE ATTACK. MELODIES THE

01:03:21.864 --> 01:03:23.366
ATTACKERS CAPABILITIES ARE

01:03:23.432 --> 01:03:25.668
EVOLVING SO QUICKLY IF YOU WANT

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:28.504
TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE SOME

01:03:28.571 --> 01:03:31.107
SOME BUILT IN. HE PROBABILITY

01:03:31.174 --> 01:03:33.476
TO CHALLENGE YOUR ASSUMPTIONS

01:03:33.543 --> 01:03:35.411
AND ENSURE THAT YOU ARE ALWAYS

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.713
IT'S NOT THE POINT THE MOST UP

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.881
TO DATE INFORMATION UPSTART

01:03:38.948 --> 01:03:41.551
TECHNOLOGY YOU'RE AWARE OF IT.

01:03:41.617 --> 01:03:43.219
AND THERE ARE RESOURCES

01:03:43.286 --> 01:03:44.620
AVAILABLE INSIDE AND OUTSIDE

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:49.158
GOVERNMENT TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:03:49.225 --> 01:03:50.726
BUT DIDN'T INFORMATION ABOUT

01:03:50.793 --> 01:03:52.395
TECHNOLOGY AND THE MOST UPDATED

01:03:52.461 --> 01:03:54.830
INFORMATION ABOUT THE TAX

01:03:54.897 --> 01:03:56.999
THAT'S ONE THING THE SECOND

01:03:57.066 --> 01:03:58.935
THING IS- MAKE SURE THAT THIS

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:02.538
AGENCY. ONE OF ITS PRIMARY

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:06.576
MISSIONS IS EDUCATION. IT NEEDS

01:04:06.642 --> 01:04:09.979
TO BE THE SOURCE FOR SMALL

01:04:10.046 --> 01:04:12.281
BUSINESS LARGE BUSINESS OTHER

01:04:12.348 --> 01:04:14.250
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IT NEEDS TO

01:04:14.317 --> 01:04:17.086
BE THAT SOURCE THAT CAMPBELL H.

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:19.622
YES REQUEST FOR UNDERSTANDING

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.991
INFORMATION BUT ALSO PUSHES OUT

01:04:22.058 --> 01:04:25.361
INFORMATION SO THAT- YOU HAVE

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:27.863
THE MOST INFORMED- GROUP OF

01:11:25.614 --> 01:11:26.615
IMPROVEMENT IN THE

01:11:26.682 --> 01:11:28.851
CYBERSECURITY RESILIENCE OF THE

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:30.319
ORGANIZATION. AND LEADING TO

01:11:30.386 --> 01:11:31.887
REPEATED EMBARRASSMENTS AS THE

01:11:31.954 --> 01:11:33.656
ORGANIZATION FALLS VICTIM TO

01:11:33.722 --> 01:11:35.491
RANSOMWARE. OR BREACH OF

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.626
CONFIDENTIAL DATA OR SOME OTHER

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:40.396
CYBER ATTACK. AS A PERSONAL

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.798
EXAMPLE I CAN SHARE THAT AS CEO

01:11:42.865 --> 01:11:44.833
OF THE UNITED STATES AIRFORCE.

01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:46.702
I FOUND THAT DESPITE SPENDING

01:11:46.769 --> 01:11:48.637
ALMOST TWO BILLION DOLLARS

01:11:48.704 --> 01:11:50.472
ANNUALLY FOR CYBER SECURITY.

01:11:50.539 --> 01:11:51.774
THE NATIONAL SECURITY AGENCY

01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:53.776
AROUND SO I WAS ABLE TO EASILY

01:11:53.842 --> 01:11:56.378
PENETRATE OUR CYBER DEFENSES

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:56.945
AND THEIR ANNUAL PENETRATION

01:11:57.012 --> 01:11:58.781
TEST. I KNEW THAT THE AIRFORCE

01:11:58.847 --> 01:12:00.683
HAD LOTS OF BRIGHT BRIGHT CYBER

01:12:00.749 --> 01:12:03.052
SECURITY EXPERTS AND ALMOST

01:12:03.118 --> 01:12:03.686
EVERY SECURITY TOOL IN

01:12:03.752 --> 01:12:05.721
EXISTENCE. YOUR OVERALL

01:12:05.788 --> 01:12:07.222
SECURITY POSTURE WAS

01:12:07.289 --> 01:12:09.758
EMBARRASSINGLY WEAK. I ASKED

01:12:09.825 --> 01:12:10.793
THEM TO SAY WHERE SHOULD I

01:12:10.859 --> 01:12:12.661
START THE ADVICE THEY PROVIDED

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:15.064
WAS START WITH STRENGTHENING

01:12:15.130 --> 01:12:16.832
DEFENSES AGAINST THE MOST

01:12:16.899 --> 01:12:19.401
COMMON ATTACK PATTERNS. WE DID

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:20.302
THIS OVER THE NEXT EIGHTEEN

01:12:20.369 --> 01:12:22.204
MONTHS THE RESULT WAS MUCH

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:24.673
IMPROVED SECURITY. BETTER

01:12:24.740 --> 01:12:26.675
OPERATIONAL SYSTEM AVAILABILITY

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:30.379
AND SURPRISINGLY LOWER ****

01:12:30.446 --> 01:12:31.714
THIS IS WHAT I AM REFERRED TO

AS A NO BRAINER. C. I. ****

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.085
DEVELOPED A BEST PRACTICE THAT

01:12:36.151 --> 01:12:37.820
WE STRONGLY BELIEVE IS THE WAY

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:40.689
TO AVOID COSTLY DISJOINTED AND

01:12:40.756 --> 01:12:41.223
INEFFECTIVE CYBERSECURITY

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:43.726
EFFORTS. IN ESSENCE THIS BEST

01:12:43.792 --> 01:12:45.728
PRACTICE IS THE ANSWER TO WHERE

01:12:45.794 --> 01:12:47.996

THE STATE. BY MAKING FINDINGS

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.821
OF THE STUDY WERE THE FOLLOWING.

01:15:25.888 --> 01:15:28.190
FIRST A FEW STATES HAVE CYBER

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.925
SECURITY GOVERNANCE EFFECTIVELY

01:15:29.992 --> 01:15:32.194
ENSURES THAT THEIR CYBER RISK

01:15:32.261 --> 01:15:34.062
IS MANAGED TO A LEVEL AND IN

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.831
WAYS THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED

01:15:35.898 --> 01:15:37.566
THROUGH GOVERNANCE PROCESS SEES

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.835
AS ACCEPTABLE TO THE GOVERNOR

01:15:39.902 --> 01:15:40.535
AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE.

01:15:40.602 --> 01:15:43.705
SECOND IF YOU COMMONLY AGREED

01:15:43.772 --> 01:15:45.540
INDICATORS OR METRICS SUGGEST

01:15:45.607 --> 01:15:47.142
TO DISCUSS CYBERSECURITY

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.511
OPERATIONS WITHIN THE STATE AND

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.446
THOSE THAT DO EXIST ARE USED

01:15:51.513 --> 01:15:54.249
INTERMITTENTLY. FINALLY THERE

01:15:54.316 --> 01:15:55.684
WAS CLEAR RECOGNITION OF THE

01:15:55.751 --> 01:15:57.719
NEED TO EXPAND GOVERNANCE

01:15:57.786 --> 01:16:00.389
BEYOND STATE LEVEL AGENCY

01:16:00.455 --> 01:16:02.691

01:16:25.614 --> 01:16:27.015
STRONG GOVERNOR EXECUTIVE

01:16:27.082 --> 01:16:28.850
LEADER IS VERY VALUABLE PERHAPS

01:16:28.917 --> 01:16:31.353
ESSENTIAL. IMPROVING CYBER

01:16:31.420 --> 01:16:32.854
SECURITY ACROSS THE STATE IS

01:16:32.921 --> 01:16:34.489
NOT A ONE OR TWO TERM AFTER

01:16:34.556 --> 01:16:36.491
LEGISLATION IS NEEDED TO CODIFY

01:16:36.558 --> 01:16:38.493
AND FORMALIZE THE NECESSARY

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:41.964

01:17:18.600 --> 01:17:20.635
STATE OF CYBERSECURITY ACROSS

01:17:20.702 --> 01:17:23.005
THEIR STATE. DURING A STUDY WE

01:17:23.071 --> 01:17:24.373
FOUND THAT STATE SENATE

01:17:24.439 --> 01:17:25.607
IMPLEMENTED THE CORE

01:17:25.674 --> 01:17:26.508
RECOMMENDATION RECOMMENDED

01:17:26.575 --> 01:17:28.477

01:17:28.543 --> 01:17:30.579
PROGRESS IN IMPROVING STATEWIDE

01:17:30.645 --> 01:17:33.348
CYBERSECURITY. LET ME CLOSE BY

01:17:33.415 --> 01:17:35.283
SAYING THAT I HAVE REVIEWED

01:17:35.350 --> 01:17:36.985
YOUR BIOGRAPHIES AND I REALIZED

01:17:37.052 --> 01:17:38.053
THAT NONE OF YOU ARE CYBER

01:17:38.120 --> 01:17:40.555
SECURITY EXPERTS IN THAT CYBER

01:17:40.622 --> 01:17:42.657
SECURITY IS A VERY COMPLEX VERY.

01:17:42.724 --> 01:17:44.159
I ENCOURAGE YOU TO CUT THROUGH

01:17:44.226 --> 01:17:46.294
THE FOG OF MORE. AND KEEP YOUR

01:17:46.361 --> 01:17:49.998
ACTIONS SIMPLE AND FOCUSED. TO

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:50.966
SUMMARIZE OUR FIRST

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:52.200
RECOMMENDATION WOULD BE TO

01:17:52.267 --> 01:17:53.435
ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR

01:17:53.502 --> 01:17:55.871
ESSENTIAL CYBER HYGIENE FOR ALL

01:17:55.937 --> 01:17:57.706
SYSTEMS AND NETWORKS WHY. THIS

01:17:57.773 --> 01:17:59.641
IS NOT THE FINAL STEP BUT IT IS

01:17:59.708 --> 01:18:01.109
ACHIEVABLE BY ALMOST ANY

01:18:01.176 --> 01:18:01.843
ORGANIZATION AND THE

01:18:01.910 --> 01:18:05.080

COLLEAGUES THE CYBER SECURITY

01:20:10.572 --> 01:20:13.608
ENVIRONMENT IS EVOLVING AND HAS

01:20:13.675 --> 01:20:15.644
BECOME INCREASINGLY HOSTILE AND

01:20:15.710 --> 01:20:18.446
INCREASINGLY COMPLEX. AND ON

01:20:18.513 --> 01:20:20.715
THE LEVEL OF THREAT IS NOT

01:20:20.782 --> 01:20:25.754
FULLY RECOGNIZED. BY MANY LOCAL

01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:26.288
GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. BUT

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:27.389
CHALLENGES FOR LOCAL

HOSPITAL DISTRICT'S EDUCATIONAL

01:20:32.794 --> 01:20:35.030
DISTRICTS ARE OTHERS. OFTEN

01:20:35.096 --> 01:20:37.532
HAVE TO DO WITH A LACK LACK OF

01:20:37.599 --> 01:20:40.235
KNOWLEDGE OR EXPERTISE THEY

01:20:40.302 --> 01:20:41.203
DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY DON'T

01:20:41.269 --> 01:20:44.306
KNOW- AND A LACK OF RESOURCES

01:20:44.372 --> 01:20:45.607
DEDICATED TO THEIR IT

01:20:45.674 --> 01:20:48.310
INFRASTRUCTURE. LOCAL

01:20:48.376 --> 01:20:50.679
GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES- ARE

01:20:50.745 --> 01:20:52.714
OFTEN OPERATING WITH OUTDATED

01:20:52.781 --> 01:20:54.683
EQUIPMENT SERVERS COMPUTERS AND

01:20:54.749 --> 01:20:56.818
SOFTWARE MAKING THEM HIGHLY

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:58.620
VULNERABLE TO CYBER SECURITY

01:20:58.687 --> 01:21:01.489
ATTACKS AND IN ADDITION AS

01:21:01.556 --> 01:21:03.525
NOTED THERE IS A KNOWLEDGE GAP

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:06.127
AND I NEED TO BRING SPECIALIZED

01:21:06.194 --> 01:21:09.764
CYBERSECURITY RESOURCES TO BEAR.

01:21:09.831 --> 01:21:12.133
ANOTHER MENTIONED EARLIER IS

01:21:12.200 --> 01:21:14.269
THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENT ENTITIES

01:21:14.336 --> 01:21:16.404
MAY BE UNDER INSURED AGAINST

01:21:16.471 --> 01:21:20.542
CYBER RISKS. ACCORDING TO- AS

01:21:20.609 --> 01:21:22.577
SURVEYED BY A RANSOMWARE

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.879
PROTECTION UNDER THE PUBLIC

01:21:24.946 --> 01:21:27.682
SECTOR LAGS BEHIND OTHER IN THE

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:29.184
PERCENTAGE OF ENTITIES THAT

01:21:29.251 --> 01:21:31.219
CARRY CYBER INSURANCE AND THE

01:21:31.286 --> 01:21:32.654
PERCENTAGE OF ENTITIES THAT

01:21:32.721 --> 01:21:34.456
CARRY RANSOMWARE COVERAGE WITH

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:38.260
ONLY ABOUT FIFTY PERCENT. HI

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:40.028
KAREN RANSOMWARE COVERAGE. THAT

01:21:40.095 --> 01:21:42.230
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THE COST OF

01:21:42.297 --> 01:21:43.898
CYBER SECURITY INCIDENT AND

01:21:43.965 --> 01:21:45.867
THAT IS BEFORE TAKING INTO

01:21:45.934 --> 01:21:49.070
ACCOUNT THE LOST PRODUCTIVITY

01:21:49.137 --> 01:21:50.639
RESULTING FROM A RANSOMWARE

01:21:50.705 --> 01:21:53.875
ATTACK WHICH IN SEVERAL CASES

01:21:53.942 --> 01:21:56.745
IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE HAND-

01:21:56.811 --> 01:21:58.046
DISABLE THE CITY'S

01:21:58.113 --> 01:22:00.982
INFRASTRUCTURE FOR FORTY SIX

01:22:01.049 --> 01:22:02.484
WEEKS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. NOW

01:22:02.550 --> 01:22:04.219
IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS

01:22:04.286 --> 01:22:06.488
DEFINED THE CONCEPT RECOVERY

01:22:06.554 --> 01:22:08.456
FROM THEIR OWN BUDGET THAT

01:22:08.523 --> 01:22:09.691
CHALLENGE CAN BECOME

01:22:09.758 --> 01:22:11.526
INSURMOUNTABLE IN PARTICULAR

01:22:11.593 --> 01:22:13.295
FOR SMALLER MUNICIPALITIES OR

01:22:13.361 --> 01:22:17.332
COUNTIES. THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:20.702
CYBER INSURANCE IS BECOMING

01:22:20.769 --> 01:22:23.538
MORE DIFFICULT- PREMIUMS ARE

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:25.840
INCREASING- THERE ARE REPORTS

01:22:25.907 --> 01:22:28.777
INCREASED BY 25% TO TWENTY

01:22:28.843 --> 01:22:29.544
TWENTY ONE AND ARE EXPECTED TO

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.746
RISE FURTHER AND AS NOTED

01:22:31.813 --> 01:22:33.648
EARLIER INSURERS ARE REVIEWING

01:22:33.715 --> 01:22:35.116
THE SECURITY PROFILES OF THE

01:22:35.183 --> 01:22:37.652
ORGANIZATIONS THAT THEY ENSURE

01:22:37.719 --> 01:22:40.488
AN EVENTUALLY- ENTITIES WITH AN

01:22:40.555 --> 01:22:42.424
ADEQUATE SECURITY SIMPLY WILL

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:44.626
NOT BE INSURABLE. I GUESS THAT

01:22:44.693 --> 01:22:46.828
CONTEXT LOCAL GOVERNMENT

01:22:46.895 --> 01:22:48.430
ENTITIES ARE INCREASINGLY

01:22:48.496 --> 01:22:51.599
BECOMING TARGETS OF ATTACKS-

01:22:51.666 --> 01:22:56.671
ALTHOUGH- BRICKWORKS VERY

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.441
ACCORDING TO- SELF ALWAYS

01:22:59.507 --> 01:23:01.676
AROUND MORE PROTECTION BENDER-

01:23:01.743 --> 01:23:03.144
RANSOMWARE ATTACKS HAVE

01:23:03.211 --> 01:23:06.781
INCREASED CLOSE 25100% SINCE

01:23:06.848 --> 01:23:09.918
TWENTY SIXTEEN AND- DEPENDING

01:23:09.984 --> 01:23:11.286

THESE ATTACKS CAN HAVE WIDE

01:23:27.669 --> 01:23:30.638
RANGING IMPLICATIONS- AND

01:23:30.705 --> 01:23:31.406

MANY CYBER SECURITY ATTACKS ARE

01:23:40.448 --> 01:23:42.250
NOT REPORTED. BECAUSE THERE IS

01:23:42.317 --> 01:23:45.520
NO LAW THAT CURRENTLY REQUIRES

01:23:45.587 --> 01:23:48.590
THEM TO BE RECORDED- THERE ARE

01:23:48.656 --> 01:23:49.891

WHAT WHAT. SHOULD WE BE DOING-

01:31:26.414 --> 01:31:28.449
WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTING

BE- IT WAS LAST BEFORE APPEARS

01:31:37.225 --> 01:31:38.593
TO BE LEGITIMATE BUT IT IS NOT

01:31:38.659 --> 01:31:40.194
THAT DOES DO YOU BELIEVE

01:31:40.261 --> 01:31:41.429

PARTICULARLY FINANCIAL

01:31:48.135 --> 01:31:49.904
INSTITUTIONS DO SOMETHING IN

01:31:49.971 --> 01:31:52.306
ADDITION TO WHAT THEY'RE DOING

01:31:52.373 --> 01:31:56.110

01:31:56.177 --> 01:31:57.378
WELL SENATOR THIS IS JOHN

GILLIGAN LET ME LET ME START

01:31:59.447 --> 01:32:02.350
WITH. A COUPLE OF COMMENTS- I

01:32:02.416 --> 01:32:04.619
THINK THAT- AS I MENTIONED IN

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:07.889
MY TESTIMONY- SEVERAL STATES

01:32:07.955 --> 01:32:09.223
SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND

01:32:09.290 --> 01:32:11.392
PROVIDING LEGISLATION. THAT

01:32:11.459 --> 01:32:14.462
DEFINES EXPECTATIONS FOR ALL

01:32:14.528 --> 01:32:15.863
PRIVATE SECTOR ORGANIZATIONS

01:32:15.930 --> 01:32:17.765
THAT DO BUSINESS WITHIN THE

01:32:17.832 --> 01:32:20.368
STATE WITH REGARD TO YOU KNOW I

01:32:20.434 --> 01:32:21.402
USE THE TERM ESSENTIAL CYBER

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:23.571
HYGIENE. YEAH I WAS VERY VERY

01:32:23.638 --> 01:32:24.739
EACH OF THESE LAWS HAVE A

01:32:24.805 --> 01:32:26.340
SOMEWHAT BROADER DEFINITION BUT

01:32:26.407 --> 01:32:29.343
IT'S AN ABSENCE SORT OF BASIC-

01:32:29.410 --> 01:32:31.646
CYBER SECURITY CONTROLS ARE

01:32:31.712 --> 01:32:34.482
SAFEGUARDS. ARE HAND THE

01:32:34.548 --> 01:32:36.050
MOTIVATION THAT IS PROVIDED IN

01:32:36.117 --> 01:32:38.219
THE LEGISLATION IS IF IN FACT

01:32:38.286 --> 01:32:41.255
YOU IMPLEMENT THE SAFEGUARDS.

01:32:41.322 --> 01:32:43.424
IF THERE IS AN ARTIFACT OF AN

01:32:43.491 --> 01:32:46.661
ATTACK OR BREACH MAN- YOU WILL

01:32:46.727 --> 01:32:50.097
BE GIVEN SAFE HARBOR AND- AND-

01:32:50.164 --> 01:32:51.499
AND THE RESPONSE IN THE

01:32:51.565 --> 01:32:53.434
LAWSUITS THAT MAY ARISE FROM

01:32:53.501 --> 01:32:55.636
THAT. AND THAT BECOMES A PRETTY

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:56.971
SIGNIFICANT MOTIVATOR IN THE

01:32:57.038 --> 01:32:59.340
SHORT TERM. I THINK IN THE LONG

01:32:59.407 --> 01:33:00.875
TERM AS WE TALKED ABOUT IN THE

01:33:00.942 --> 01:33:02.910
PREVIOUS PANEL I THINK THE US

01:33:02.977 --> 01:33:06.480
CYBER INSURANCE- COMMUNITY- CAN

01:33:06.547 --> 01:33:09.250
PROVIDE AN ENORMOUS MOTIVATOR-

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:11.686
FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR. BUT I

01:33:11.752 --> 01:33:14.455
THINK AS WAS MENTIONED BY MR

01:33:14.522 --> 01:33:16.924
AMERICAN ARMY. THE INTO WE GET

01:33:16.991 --> 01:33:19.493
SOME BETTER DATA- IT'S GONNA BE

01:33:19.560 --> 01:33:20.528
A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT BUT I

01:33:20.594 --> 01:33:22.196
THINK IN THE SHORT TERM.

01:33:22.263 --> 01:33:24.966
LEGISLATION THAT- REINFORCES

01:33:25.032 --> 01:33:27.401
THE IMPORTANCE AND PROVIDES IT

01:33:27.468 --> 01:33:29.470
THIS POINT VOLUNTARY ADOPTION.

01:33:29.537 --> 01:33:35.376
OF. YOUR WORK WERE OUT OR

01:33:35.443 --> 01:33:38.112
SAFEGUARDS IS REALLY SORT OF A

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:40.181
PRUDENT WAY TO GET THE BALL

01:33:40.247 --> 01:33:42.516

YES I AGREE THAT THERE IS A

01:33:52.593 --> 01:33:55.830
NEED TO ALIGN THE CYBER

01:33:55.896 --> 01:33:57.064
SECURITY STANDARDS WITH

01:33:57.131 --> 01:33:58.532
REQUIREMENTS OF INSURANCE

01:33:58.599 --> 01:34:01.535
COMPANIES TO INSURE. SO THAT

01:34:01.602 --> 01:34:03.771
LOCAL ENTITIES CAN IN FACT BE

01:34:03.838 --> 01:34:07.041

I KEEP GETTING TOLD BY EVERYONE

01:36:37.925 --> 01:36:39.293
WHO KNOWS CYBERSECURITY THAT

01:36:39.360 --> 01:36:41.028
GOOD HYGIENE IS THE BEST WAY TO

01:36:41.095 --> 01:36:43.430
AVOID CYBER ATTACKS- BUT I

01:36:43.497 --> 01:36:44.765
WONDER FOR LOOKING AHEAD TEN

01:36:44.832 --> 01:36:45.799
YEARS IF THAT'S STILL GOING TO

01:36:45.866 --> 01:36:46.867
BE THE CASE AND I JUST BE

01:36:46.934 --> 01:36:48.102
INTERESTED IN EITHER YOUR

01:36:48.169 --> 01:36:48.602
THOUGHTS ARE BOTH YOUR

01:36:48.669 --> 01:36:50.638
THOUGHTS. ON THE QUESTION OF

01:36:50.704 --> 01:36:51.906
SORT OF WHAT WE'RE THE CYBER

01:36:51.972 --> 01:36:53.073
ATTACKS THE FUTURE GONNA COME

01:36:53.140 --> 01:36:55.543
FROM IN PARTICULAR I REMEMBER

01:36:55.609 --> 01:36:56.610
READING SOMETHING IN THE

01:36:56.677 --> 01:36:58.512
FINANCIAL TIMES NOT SO LONG AGO

01:36:58.579 --> 01:37:00.748
THAT JUST PORTENDED A LOT TO

01:37:00.814 --> 01:37:03.083
DO- CHINA HAD WON THE A. I. WAR

01:37:03.150 --> 01:37:05.019
I THINK IN A NUMBER OF UN

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:06.954
NAMED- PENTAGON FOLKS AND SAID-

01:37:07.021 --> 01:37:09.290
AND- GIVEN THE INCREASING USE

01:37:09.356 --> 01:37:11.358
OF A. I. IN IN INCREASING

01:37:11.425 --> 01:37:14.195
SOPHISTICATED CYBER ATTACKS-

01:37:14.261 --> 01:37:15.696
YOU KNOW HOW HOW BIG A ROLE

01:37:15.763 --> 01:37:17.264
SECOND PLAY GOING FORWARD AND

01:37:17.331 --> 01:37:20.801
WHAT. CAN WE DO AGAINST AGAINST

01:37:20.868 --> 01:37:22.803
THOSE TYPES OF ATTACKS. SENATOR

01:37:22.870 --> 01:37:25.973
THANK YOU- LET ME YEAH MAYBE

01:37:26.040 --> 01:37:28.275
PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:31.245
THAT MAY HELP YOU- WHEN YOU

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:32.680
TRYING TO MITIGATE AGAINST

01:37:32.746 --> 01:37:36.150
CYBER ATTACKS- WHAT YOU FIND IS

01:37:36.217 --> 01:37:39.920
THAT- THE ATTACKERS GO AGAINST

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:44.725
THE EASIEST ROUTE- AND SO. WHEN

01:37:44.792 --> 01:37:46.126
WE TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF

01:37:46.193 --> 01:37:48.529
CYBER HYGIENE THIS IS SORT OF

01:37:48.596 --> 01:37:51.098
THE BASICS THE FOUNDATIONS AND

01:37:51.165 --> 01:37:53.334
SO I SENT ANOTHER WAY I'M

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.069
SPENDING LOTS OF MONEY ON FANCY

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:57.471
TOOLS AND TRYING TO ADDRESS

01:37:57.538 --> 01:37:58.939
SOME OF THE MORE SOPHISTICATED

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:02.776
ATTACKS. IS USELESS IF IN FACT

01:38:02.843 --> 01:38:04.211
YOU HAVEN'T DONE THE BASICS

01:38:04.278 --> 01:38:06.146
BLOCKING AND TACKLING BECAUSE

01:38:06.213 --> 01:38:08.749
WHAT YOU FIND IS. THE BASIC

01:38:08.816 --> 01:38:12.586
BLOCKING AND TACKLING THE

01:38:12.653 --> 01:38:13.721
HYGIENE AS WE DISCUSSED. IS

01:38:13.787 --> 01:38:16.590
WHAT'S NECESSARY TO TAMP DOWN

01:38:16.657 --> 01:38:19.260
THE GREAT MULTITUDE OF ATTACKS

01:38:19.326 --> 01:38:20.661
AND IT'S ONLY WHEN YOU TAMP

01:38:20.728 --> 01:38:22.863
THEM DOWN BUT YOU CAN KIND OF

01:38:22.930 --> 01:38:24.665
LESSEN THE NOISE AND YOU CAN

01:38:24.732 --> 01:38:25.866
START TO FOCUS ON THE MORE

01:38:25.933 --> 01:38:28.002
SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS SO IT

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:30.104
REALLY IS A- REVOLUTION. BUT

01:38:30.170 --> 01:38:31.905
YOU MUST START WITH HYGIENE IF

01:38:31.972 --> 01:38:33.774
YOU DON'T HAVE HYGIENE AS I

01:38:33.841 --> 01:38:35.943
SAID IT'S REALLY. NOT A GREAT

01:38:36.010 --> 01:38:37.711
VALUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS THE

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:39.513
SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS BECAUSE

01:38:39.580 --> 01:38:40.881
IN MANY CASES YOU'RE LOOKING

01:38:40.948 --> 01:38:42.783
FOR A NEEDLE IN A HAYSTACK AND

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:44.485
IT'S A VERY NOISY ENVIRONMENT

01:38:44.551 --> 01:38:47.788
WITH ALL THE ATTACKS- I THINK.

01:38:47.855 --> 01:38:49.390
I DID I WOULD WANT TO HAVE ONE

01:38:49.456 --> 01:38:51.158
COMMENT TO ABOUT ARTIFICIAL

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:51.892
INTELLIGENCE I THINK YOUR

01:38:51.959 --> 01:38:53.661
OBSERVATION ABOUT YOUR MANAGER

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:56.130
IS A GOOD ONE- THERE HAVE BEEN

01:38:56.196 --> 01:38:59.433
A LOT OF- EFFORTS AND- AND YOU

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:00.901
KNOW COMPANIES LIKE PALO ALTO

01:39:00.968 --> 01:39:02.403
AND OTHERS ARE INCREASINGLY

01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:05.572
USING. ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE

01:39:05.639 --> 01:39:08.876
BOTH TO HELP DEFEND- AND WE

01:39:08.942 --> 01:39:10.411
KNOW THAT ATTACKERS ARE

01:39:10.477 --> 01:39:11.578
STARTING TO BUT IT'S STILL A

01:39:11.645 --> 01:39:13.614
BIT EARLY ARE STARTING TO USE

01:39:13.681 --> 01:39:17.951
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE. ARE ON

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:18.752
THE OFFENSIVE SIDE. AND SO I

01:39:18.819 --> 01:39:21.288
THIS IS AN AREA THAT. SERVED TO

01:39:21.355 --> 01:39:23.857
ME SORT OF INDICATES THAT WE

01:39:23.924 --> 01:39:26.026
GOTTA GET MOVING QUICKLY AND IN

01:39:26.093 --> 01:39:27.761
DOING THE BASICS OF BLOCKING

01:39:27.828 --> 01:39:30.564
AND TACKLING BECAUSE- AS

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:33.200
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE ISSUES-

01:39:33.267 --> 01:39:35.836
IT WILL ADD BY THE ATTACKERS.

01:39:35.903 --> 01:39:36.870
IT'S GOING TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE

01:39:36.937 --> 01:39:38.806
DIFFICULT TO BE ABLE TO

01:39:38.872 --> 01:39:41.108
IDENTIFY THEM. AND I THINK ON

01:39:41.175 --> 01:39:43.977
THE POSITIVE SIDE AS COMPANIES-

01:39:44.044 --> 01:39:46.380
PALO ALTO FIRE RIGHT-

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:47.948
CROWDSTRIKE CONSIDERING USING

01:39:48.015 --> 01:39:49.817
ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE.

01:39:49.883 --> 01:39:51.251
THEY'RE ACTUALLY ABLE TO PICK

01:39:51.318 --> 01:39:52.720
UP SOME OF THE MORE

01:39:52.786 --> 01:39:55.189
SOPHISTICATED ATTACKS. THAT ARE

01:39:55.255 --> 01:39:57.157
NOT BEING PICKED UP BY WHAT I

01:39:57.224 --> 01:39:58.659
WOULD CALL BASIC CYBER HYGIENE

01:39:58.726 --> 01:40:00.694
SOFTWARE I'VE BEEN- CLEARING IN

01:40:00.761 --> 01:40:02.629
MY- MY RESPONSE TO YOUR

01:40:02.696 --> 01:40:06.467
QUESTION. NO EXCELLENT RESPONSE

THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MR. GIVE

01:40:07.901 --> 01:40:10.704
ME THE ANSWER. I WOULD JUST ADD

01:40:10.771 --> 01:40:13.374
THAT I THINK IT'S CRITICAL TO

01:40:13.440 --> 01:40:14.675
IT IS GOING TO BECOME

01:40:14.742 --> 01:40:16.310
INCREASINGLY SPACE CAT IT AS

01:40:16.377 --> 01:40:18.278
FREE AS WE NOW ON BOTH SIDES OF

01:40:18.345 --> 01:40:19.446
THE AISLE BOTH THE CYBER

01:40:19.513 --> 01:40:22.015
ATTACKERS AND ITS DEFENDERS-

01:40:22.082 --> 01:40:23.550
THERE WILL BE ARTIFICIAL

01:40:23.617 --> 01:40:25.786
INTELLIGENCE INVOLVED IN. ON

01:40:25.853 --> 01:40:28.122
BOTH- FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:30.724
AISLE AND I THEREFORE IT'S

01:40:30.791 --> 01:40:32.126
CRITICAL I THINK TO PUT CENTER

01:40:32.192 --> 01:40:35.129
HYGIENE IN PLACE NOW BECAUSE

01:40:35.195 --> 01:40:36.530
WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FUTURE TEN

01:40:36.597 --> 01:40:38.198
YEARS FROM NOW OUR CITIES ARE

01:40:38.265 --> 01:40:40.000
GOING TO BE DIGITAL AND THE ALL

01:40:40.067 --> 01:40:41.969
THE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ATTACK

01:40:42.035 --> 01:40:43.203
AND THE IMPLICATIONS OF CYBER

01:40:43.270 --> 01:40:45.539
ATTACKS ARE GOING TO BE EVEN

01:40:45.606 --> 01:40:46.607
FAR MORE THAN WHAT WE SEE EACH

01:40:46.673 --> 01:40:52.579
DAY. SO I COMMEND. THE WORK OF

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:53.547

INSURANCE AND CYBER SECURITY

01:40:58.786 --> 01:41:01.255
INSURANCE AS A KEY. CONDUIT TO

01:41:01.321 --> 01:41:02.956
TRYING TO GET A DIFFERENT

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:04.591
ACTORS IN OUR VERY DIVERSE

01:41:04.658 --> 01:41:06.493

HYGIENE PRACTICES OR OTHER- YOU

01:41:10.030 --> 01:41:12.399
KNOW ACTUALLY BASED- PRACTICES

01:41:12.466 --> 01:41:14.902
AGAINST CYBER ATTACKS- AND I

01:41:14.968 --> 01:41:16.003
OTHER THAN DATA WHICH I THINK

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:17.237
YOU BOTH MENTIONED ISN'T AS

01:41:17.304 --> 01:41:18.672
BEING IMPORTANT FOR DETERMINING

01:41:18.739 --> 01:41:21.208
THE RISKS HERE. WHAT ELSE CAN

01:41:21.275 --> 01:41:22.876
WE BE THINKING ABOUT AS FAR AS

01:41:22.943 --> 01:41:25.412
STANDING UP MORE CYBER SECURITY

01:41:25.479 --> 01:41:28.081
INSURANCE AND MAKING THIS MORE

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:32.519
OF A UBIQUITOUS- THING. DAVID

01:41:32.586 --> 01:41:34.621
LET ME START AND- AND TRY TO

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:37.458
UNPACK A LITTLE BIT WHEN WE SAY

01:41:37.524 --> 01:41:39.226
NEED MORE DATA WHAT DO WE NEED-

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:41.728
SO IN FACT- MY ORGANIZATION

01:41:41.795 --> 01:41:43.230
CENTER FOR INTERNET SECURITY

01:41:43.297 --> 01:41:45.032
HAS HAD ONGOING DISCUSSIONS

01:41:45.098 --> 01:41:47.501
WITH RESILIENCE INSURERS- AND

01:41:47.568 --> 01:41:50.771
OTHERS. BUT AND OUR OBJECTIVE

01:41:50.838 --> 01:41:51.772
HAS BEEN AS WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:53.907
IN THIS HEARING. TO GET TO THE

01:41:53.974 --> 01:41:56.376
POINT WHERE. THE INSURANCE

01:41:56.443 --> 01:41:58.145
COMPANY IS ABLE TO OFFER

01:41:58.212 --> 01:42:00.647

THAT IMPLEMENT CERTAIN- SUCH

01:42:04.017 --> 01:42:06.753
CYBERSECURITY PRACTICES- WHEN

01:42:06.820 --> 01:42:09.389
WE SAY THERE'S NO DATA- THE

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:11.191
CYBER SECURITY OR THE INSURANCE

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:12.693
INDUSTRY IS ALL ABOUT MANAGING

01:42:12.759 --> 01:42:14.661
RISK AND SO THEY ARE VERY

01:42:14.728 --> 01:42:17.664
WILLING. TO OFFER DISCOUNTS IF

01:42:17.731 --> 01:42:20.100
THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE THAT

01:42:20.167 --> 01:42:22.336
DOING A. B. C. AND D. E. R.

01:42:22.402 --> 01:42:24.571
REDUCES RASK AND THEN WHAT THEY

01:42:24.638 --> 01:42:26.073
HAVE TO DO IS UNDERSTAND TO

01:42:26.139 --> 01:42:28.809
WHAT EXTENT. DOING YOU KNOW ABC

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:30.210
INDY SO FOR EXAMPLE

01:42:30.277 --> 01:42:31.578
IMPLEMENTING CYBER HYGIENE

01:42:31.645 --> 01:42:33.247
THAT'S SORT OF BEEN THE

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:33.780
DISCUSSION WE'VE HAD WITH

01:42:33.847 --> 01:42:35.716
RESILIENCE. WHAT'S THE

01:42:35.782 --> 01:42:37.150
PERCENTAGE OF DISCOUNT SHOULD

01:42:37.217 --> 01:42:40.387
BE 10% 20% AT CENTER. IN ORDER

01:42:40.454 --> 01:42:42.422
TO BE ABLE TO GET THE DATA AND

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:43.657
I THINK IT WAS MENTIONED IN THE

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:45.826
PREVIOUS PANEL. YOU NOT ONLY

01:42:45.893 --> 01:42:48.161
NEED TO KNOW WHAT WAS-

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:49.997
IMPLEMENTED BUT YOU ALSO NEED

01:42:50.063 --> 01:42:51.665
TO KNOW WHAT WAS THE STATE OF

01:42:51.732 --> 01:42:55.102
THE SYSTEM. THAT WAS BREACHED-

01:42:55.168 --> 01:42:57.371
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO DROP I'M

01:42:57.437 --> 01:42:59.006
VERY FINE GRAINED CORRELATION

01:42:59.072 --> 01:43:01.208
BETWEEN OKAY WAS THIS

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:03.544
PARTICULAR SO AN ORGANIZATION

01:43:03.610 --> 01:43:05.712
MAY FOR EXAMPLE IMPLEMENTED

01:43:05.779 --> 01:43:06.780
CYBER HYGIENE IN EIGHTY

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:09.049
PERCENT. BUT THEY MISSED 20%

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:11.418
AND SO WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO DO

01:43:11.485 --> 01:43:13.020
IS TO WORK WITH IN PARTICULAR

01:43:13.086 --> 01:43:14.254
SINCE WE HAVE A CLOSE

01:43:14.321 --> 01:43:15.322
RELATIONSHIP WITH LOCAL

01:43:15.389 --> 01:43:18.258
ORGANIZATIONS IS. AS THEY ARE

01:43:18.325 --> 01:43:19.826
AND THEY HAVE A SUCCESSFUL

01:43:19.893 --> 01:43:22.129
ATTACK OR BREACH MAY PROVIDE US

01:43:22.195 --> 01:43:23.597
BASICALLY INFORMATION THAT

01:43:23.664 --> 01:43:25.332
DESCRIBES WHAT WAS THE STATE OF

01:43:25.399 --> 01:43:26.733
THE ENVIRONMENT WHAT CYBER

01:43:26.800 --> 01:43:28.268
SECURITY SAFEGUARDS CONTROLS

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:31.004
WERE IN PLACE- WHAT WAS THE-

01:43:31.071 --> 01:43:32.839
THE- THE- THE STATE OF THE

01:43:32.906 --> 01:43:35.108
SOFTWARE ETCETERA. AND THROUGH

01:43:35.175 --> 01:43:37.044
THAT ANALYSIS WORKING WITH THE

01:43:37.110 --> 01:43:42.683
INSURANCE. COMPANY WE THINK AND

01:43:42.749 --> 01:43:43.483
THE ROLE OF JIM FUTURE WE

01:43:43.550 --> 01:43:44.051
SHOULD BE ABLE TO START TO

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.953
PROVIDE STUDENTS. AND I. AS WAS

01:43:46.019 --> 01:43:47.454
MEANT BY MISS MAC- THE

01:43:47.521 --> 01:43:49.289
INSURANCE OR INSURANCE INDUSTRY

01:43:49.356 --> 01:43:50.857
RIGHT NOW FOR CYBER SECURITY IS

01:43:50.924 --> 01:43:52.893
REALLY STRUGGLING BECAUSE- THE

01:43:52.960 --> 01:43:54.528
SPATE OF RANSOMWARE ATTACKS IS

01:43:54.595 --> 01:43:56.063
REALLY CHANGE THEIR BUSINESS

01:43:56.129 --> 01:43:57.965
MODEL DRAMATICALLY- THAT'LL

01:43:58.031 --> 01:44:00.467
SETTLE DOWN- BUT I THINK-

01:44:00.534 --> 01:44:01.602
HOPEFULLY WHEN WE GET THAT

01:44:01.668 --> 01:44:02.736
SETTLED DOWN WILL BE IN A

01:44:02.803 --> 01:44:05.138
POSITION WHERE. THE INSURANCE

01:44:05.205 --> 01:44:06.607
ORGANIZATIONS ONE WILL BE

01:44:06.673 --> 01:44:09.042
MOTIVATED- AND BECAUSE I WILL

01:44:09.109 --> 01:44:10.444
TELL YOU A LITTLE OVER A YEAR

01:44:10.510 --> 01:44:14.381
AGO. WHEN I WENT TO INSURANCE

01:44:14.448 --> 01:44:15.549
COMPANIES THEIR ANSWER WAS. YOU

01:44:15.616 --> 01:44:16.717
KNOW DON'T TALK TO ME ABOUT

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:18.085
OFFERING DISCOUNTS RIGHT NOW

01:44:18.151 --> 01:44:20.087
WE'RE SELLING SO MUCH CYBER

01:44:20.153 --> 01:44:20.854
SECURITY INSURANCE AND IT'S THE

01:44:20.921 --> 01:44:22.723
MOST PROFITABLE. PRODUCT WE

01:44:22.789 --> 01:44:25.692
HAVE- BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:26.660
GOING TO JEOPARDIZE IT BY

01:44:26.727 --> 01:44:28.795
PUTTING ANY ROADBLOCKS IN THE

01:44:28.862 --> 01:44:30.697
PROCESS WELL THE LAST YEAR AS

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:32.532
YOU PROGRAM THE HEARING TODAY.

01:44:32.599 --> 01:44:34.501
THAT'S CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND

01:44:34.568 --> 01:44:35.702
SO A LOT OF COMPANIES ARE

01:44:35.769 --> 01:44:37.337
GETTING OUT OF THE MARKET

01:44:37.404 --> 01:44:39.306
BECAUSE OF THE- THE REST BUT I

01:44:39.373 --> 01:44:41.041
THINK IS THAT SETTLES DOWN. I

01:44:41.108 --> 01:44:42.509
THINK WE'RE ON A PATH TO BEING

01:44:42.576 --> 01:44:44.378
ABLE TO GET TO THE TYPES OF

01:44:44.444 --> 01:44:46.079
INFORMATION WE NEED TO BE ABLE

01:44:46.146 --> 01:44:47.581
TO START TO OFFER DISCOUNTS.

01:44:47.648 --> 01:44:49.016
AND I AND I THINK THAT'S GOING

01:44:49.082 --> 01:44:50.751
TO BE ONE OF THE MOST POSITIVE

01:44:50.817 --> 01:44:53.086
MOTIVATORS TO GET- BOTH
