YEAH I WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A MORE

00:38:01.212 --> 00:38:01.779
FUNDING FOR ACTIVE

00:38:01.846 --> 00:38:03.247
TRANSPORTATION I WOULD SAY THAT

00:38:03.314 --> 00:38:04.782
ARE ACTIVE TRANSPORTATION-

00:38:04.849 --> 00:38:05.616
PROJECTS HAVE BEEN

00:38:05.683 --> 00:38:06.917
OVERSUBSCRIBED FOR THE LAST FEW

00:38:06.984 --> 00:38:08.452
YEARS WE'VE GOT CITIES ACROSS

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:09.654
THE STATE AGENCIES ACROSS THE

00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:11.756
STATE WHO HAVE PROJECTS THAT ARE

00:38:11.822 --> 00:38:12.923
SHOVEL READY READY TO GO THAT

00:38:12.990 --> 00:38:14.925
WILL SAVE LIVES FOR THEIR

00:38:14.992 --> 00:38:17.261
CONSTITUENTS- BUT THEY ONLY

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:19.163
HAVEN'T BEFORE BECAUSE- OF A

00:38:19.230 --> 00:38:31.042
LACK OF FUNDING. YEAH IT'S FUNNY. OKAY NO PROBLEM SORRY WE'RE

00:38:31.108 --> 00:38:33.110
JUST TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME

00:38:33.177 --> 00:38:34.912
TECH TECHNOLOGICAL ISSUES HERE-

00:38:34.979 --> 00:38:36.914
I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

00:38:36.981 --> 00:38:39.517
THE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY

00:38:39.583 --> 00:38:44.321
MILLION DOLLARS A SO OF I DO

00:38:44.388 --> 00:38:46.390
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE

00:38:46.457 --> 00:38:47.058
SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

00:38:47.124 --> 00:38:48.426
DOLLARS PROPOSED FOR INCENTIVE

00:38:48.492 --> 00:38:49.427
GRANTS TO TRANSIT AND RAIL

00:38:49.493 --> 00:38:50.995
AGENCIES TO PROVIDE FREE

00:38:51.062 --> 00:38:52.997
TRANSPORTATION MONTHS AND IT

00:38:53.064 --> 00:38:53.831
SOUNDS VERY LAUDABLE AND OF

00:38:53.898 --> 00:38:55.232
COURSE THERE ARE YOUR SOME

00:38:55.299 --> 00:38:56.801
SPECIFIC POPULATIONS THAT CAN

00:38:56.867 --> 00:38:58.669
BENEFIT FROM FREE TRANSIT MANY

00:38:58.736 --> 00:38:59.770
OF THEM ALREADY RECEIVE THAT

00:38:59.837 --> 00:39:01.072
THROUGH VARIOUS PROGRAMS ACROSS

00:39:01.138 --> 00:39:03.274
THE STATE HOWEVER. WHEN YOU DO

00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:05.042
WE DO FOCUS GROUPS WITH TRANSIT

00:39:05.109 --> 00:39:06.911
RIDERS AND WE ASK THEM WHAT THEY

00:39:06.977 --> 00:39:08.012
WANT TO SEE FREE TRANSIT IS

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:10.047
RARELY EVEN ON THE LIST WHAT

00:39:10.114 --> 00:39:12.249
TRANSIT RIDERS CONSTANTLY SAY IN

00:39:12.316 --> 00:39:13.350
THIS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE

00:39:13.417 --> 00:39:15.953
STATE THAT THE FARES ARE NOT A

00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.755
BARRIER TO PEOPLE TAKING

00:39:17.822 --> 00:39:19.023
TRANSIT. AND IT'S NOT A PRIORITY

00:39:19.090 --> 00:39:20.424
FOR THOSE RIDERS BUT WHAT THEY

00:39:20.491 --> 00:39:22.593
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS MORE-

00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:24.328
COMPREHENSIVE SERVICE THEY WOULD

00:39:24.395 --> 00:39:26.163
LIKE TO SEE SERVICE THAT IS AT

00:39:26.230 --> 00:39:27.231
MORE CONVENIENT TIMES AN

00:39:27.298 --> 00:39:28.999
EXPANDED TIMES THEY DON'T HAVE

00:39:29.066 --> 00:39:30.468
TO WAIT THEY WANT TO SEE CLEANER

00:39:30.534 --> 00:39:31.435
PUBLIC TRANSIT AND THEY

00:39:31.502 --> 00:39:33.671
CERTAINLY WANT TO SEE SAY FOR

00:39:33.738 --> 00:39:35.306
PUBLIC TRANSIT SO I WOULD

00:39:35.372 --> 00:39:36.373
STRONGLY SAID MINISTRATION

00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:38.342
CONSIDER ALL TRANSIT AGENCIES TO

00:39:38.409 --> 00:39:40.344
INSTEAD USE THESE FUNDS TO

00:39:40.411 --> 00:39:42.546
INCREASE THE SERVICE THAT THEY

00:39:42.613 --> 00:39:43.781
OFFER TO IMPROVE THE SERVICE

00:39:43.848 --> 00:39:45.416
THAT THEY OFFER- AND MAYBE

00:39:45.483 --> 00:39:47.451
TARGET FREE TRANSIT JUST CERTAIN

00:39:47.518 --> 00:39:48.219
POPULATIONS WHO SAY THAT THEY

00:39:48.285 --> 00:39:50.221
NEED IT. BUT TO ALLOW THEM THE

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:52.923
FLEXIBILITY TO USE THAT MONEY TO

00:39:52.990 --> 00:39:54.558
IMPROVE TRANSIT SO THAT MORE

00:39:54.625 --> 00:39:56.794
PEOPLE WANT TO USE IT- THE

00:39:56.861 --> 00:39:58.496
LEGISLATIVE ANALYST TO RAISE

00:39:58.562 --> 00:39:59.864
CONCERNS ABOUT USING GREENHOUSE

00:39:59.930 --> 00:40:02.299
GAS REDUCTION FUNDS FOR PROJECTS

00:40:02.366 --> 00:40:03.701
THAT WOULD QUALIFY AS CAPITAL

00:40:03.768 --> 00:40:05.369
OUTLAY UNDER THE STATE

00:40:05.436 --> 00:40:06.604
APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT INCLUDING

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:08.139
HIGH SPEED RAIL TRANSIT PROJECTS

00:40:08.205 --> 00:40:09.173
AND INCENTIVES FOR HEAVY DUTY

00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:11.442
VEHICLES I WOULD LIKE TO EXPLORE

00:40:11.509 --> 00:40:13.477
SWAPPING GIGI R. F. FOR GENERAL

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:15.246

00:40:15.312 --> 00:40:17.448
OUTLAY PROJECTS AND USED EACH

00:40:17.515 --> 00:40:18.783
YEAR AFTER CLIMATE RELATED

00:40:18.849 --> 00:40:20.217
ACTIVITIES FOR THE NON

00:40:20.284 --> 00:40:21.952
EXCLUDABLE PROJECTS. THIS WOULD

00:40:22.019 --> 00:40:23.320
REDUCE OVERALL GENERAL FUND

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.455
SPENDING SUBJECT TO THE STATE

00:40:24.522 --> 00:40:27.424

TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWO AND

00:40:31.228 --> 00:40:33.264
TWENTY THREE. I'M SHIFTING GEARS

00:40:33.330 --> 00:40:34.765
TO ANIMALS FOR A MOMENT-

00:40:34.832 --> 00:40:36.267
HIGHWAYS OR MAJOR BECAUSE OF

00:40:36.333 --> 00:40:38.302
WILDLIFE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.069
THERE ARE ALSO A MAJOR

00:40:39.136 --> 00:40:40.738
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE DECLINE OF

00:40:40.805 --> 00:40:42.273
WILDLIFE POPULATIONS THAT BECOME

00:40:42.339 --> 00:40:43.574
ISOLATED BY HABITAT

00:40:43.641 --> 00:40:45.176
FRAGMENTATION I LOSE

00:40:45.242 --> 00:40:46.277
CONNECTIVITY THROUGHOUT THEIR

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:48.045
RANGE AND THIS OBSTACLES TO

00:40:48.112 --> 00:40:49.346
WILDLIFE MOVEMENT IS ALSO A

00:40:49.413 --> 00:40:51.248
MAJOR THREAT TO PUBLIC SAFETY.

00:40:51.315 --> 00:40:52.616
ON AVERAGE FIVE PEOPLE ARE

00:40:52.683 --> 00:40:54.552
KILLED AND OVER TWO HUNDRED AND

00:40:54.618 --> 00:40:56.220
FIFTY PEOPLE ARE INJURED IN

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:57.855
CALIFORNIA IN REPORTED VIEW

00:40:57.922 --> 00:40:58.556
WILDLIFE VEHICLE COLLISIONS

00:40:58.622 --> 00:41:00.791
EVERY YEAR I APPRECIATE THAT THE

00:41:00.858 --> 00:41:02.092
GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING THAT WE

00:41:02.159 --> 00:41:03.327
PROVIDE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS TO

00:41:03.394 --> 00:41:05.196
THE WILDLIFE CONSERVATION BOARD

00:41:05.262 --> 00:41:06.564
FOR THE FISH PASSAGE WILDLIFE

QUARTERS PROGRAM WHEN THE NEED

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.201
FOR THIS PROGRAM IS TOO GREAT

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.369
AND I WOULD PROPOSAL WE ALLOCATE

00:41:12.436 --> 00:41:12.903
AN ADDITIONAL ONE HUNDRED

00:41:12.970 --> 00:41:14.271
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT

00:41:14.338 --> 00:41:15.105
PROGRAM. FOR A TOTAL OF A

00:41:15.172 --> 00:41:16.307
HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION

00:41:16.373 --> 00:41:17.374

00:41:17.441 --> 00:41:19.310
BLOOM I KNOW YOU HAVE BEEN A

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:20.811
HUGE CHAMPION OF THIS ISSUE OVER

00:41:20.878 --> 00:41:21.979
THE YEARS SO I'VE I'M JUST HERE

00:41:22.046 --> 00:41:24.215
TO SAY LET'S GIVE IT MORE MONEY

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:25.749
BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT

00:41:25.816 --> 00:41:27.918
IS. I WAS I KNOW I'M SPEEDING UP

00:41:27.985 --> 00:41:29.153
OKAY- IT'S GREAT TO SEE THE

SPENDING TO TACKLE THE CLIMATE

00:41:34.859 --> 00:41:36.627
CRISIS AND SUPPORT CLEAN ENERGY.

00:41:36.694 --> 00:41:38.229
IT'S MY HOPE THAT WE'RE NOT ONLY

00:41:38.295 --> 00:41:39.063
MAKING CONSENT OF MONEY

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:40.965
AVAILABLE BUT THAT WERE ALSO

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:41.799
LEVERAGING THE AVAILABILITY OF

00:41:41.866 --> 00:41:43.434
INCENTIVES TO CREATE ROBUST

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.069
POLICY FRAMEWORKS SO THAT CLEAN

00:41:45.135 --> 00:41:46.570
ENERGY SOLUTION PROVIDERS CAN

00:41:46.637 --> 00:41:48.873
CONTRIBUTE TO SCALE AND THRIVE

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:50.474
WHEN INSTEAD OF MONEY MIGHT NOT

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:51.275
BE AVAILABLE IN FUTURE BUDGET

00:41:51.342 --> 00:41:53.177
YEARS. AND WHILE I SUPPORT

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:54.511
INCENTIVES FOR CLEAN DISTRIBUTED

00:41:54.578 --> 00:41:56.914
ENERGY RESOURCES WE ALSO NEED TO

00:41:56.981 --> 00:41:58.816
TAKE A HARD LOOK AT HOW TO MAKE

00:41:58.883 --> 00:42:00.117
SURE THESE RESOURCES CAN PROVIDE

00:42:00.184 --> 00:42:01.652
RELIABILITY AND VALUE AND

00:42:01.719 --> 00:42:03.587
SATISFY RELIABILITY CONCERNS

00:42:03.654 --> 00:42:05.055
THAT WE HEAR FROM THE CALIFORNIA

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:07.658
INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR

00:42:07.725 --> 00:42:08.425
SYSTEMS OPERATORS. SOLAR AND

00:42:08.492 --> 00:42:10.094
STORAGE CREATE THE ABILITY FOR

00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:12.463
CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE THEIR CARBON

00:42:12.529 --> 00:42:13.330
FOOTPRINTS. AND TO MEET THEIR

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:14.965
CLEAN ENERGY AND RECITE THE

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:16.467
RESILIENCY LEADS. ABOUT

00:42:16.533 --> 00:42:18.002
INCENTIVES ALONE WON'T SCALE

00:42:18.068 --> 00:42:19.003
THIS DISTRICT WON'T SCALE

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:21.205
DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES AND

00:42:21.272 --> 00:42:22.139
WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE THESE

00:42:22.206 --> 00:42:23.841
RESOURCES PROVIDE VALUE TO THE

00:42:23.908 --> 00:42:25.376
WHOLE GRID. TO ENSURE THAT

00:42:25.442 --> 00:42:27.544
CUSTOMERS WHO CAN'T. PARTICIPATE

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:29.914
DIRECTLY IN SOLAR CAN ALSO

00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.082
PARTICIPATE IN ALSO BENEFIT AND

00:42:32.149 --> 00:42:34.485
IN WHAT THEY PROVIDE. AND

TRANSPORTATION ROUTE. TO CONNECT

00:42:47.197 --> 00:42:48.799

SECTION. OF THE L. A. RIVER.

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.650
THAT IS YET TO BE FULLY FUNDED

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:09.053
IS IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY

00:43:09.119 --> 00:43:10.020
WHICH IS HOME TO ALMOST TWO

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:10.487
MILLION PEOPLE. WERE

00:43:10.554 --> 00:43:11.789
APPROXIMATELY THIRTEEN MILES OF

PATH REMAIN INCOMPLETE. THIS

00:43:14.124 --> 00:43:15.426
MAJOR SEGMENT WHEN COMPLETED

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:17.061
WILL CREATE A ROUTE THAT WILL

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.629
ALLOW FOR CAR FREE AND SAFE.

00:43:18.696 --> 00:43:20.564
MOBILITY FROM CANOGA PARK ALL

00:43:20.631 --> 00:43:22.366
THE WAY TO LONG BEACH. AND

00:43:25.269 --> 00:43:26.537
RIVERS PROXIMITY TO CHEAP TO

00:43:26.603 --> 00:43:28.205
KEEP TRANSIT STATIONS AND MAJOR

00:43:28.272 --> 00:43:30.441
BUS ROUTES WILL ALLOW USERS OF

00:43:30.507 --> 00:43:32.042
THIS. L. A. RIVER WAY TO

00:43:32.109 --> 00:43:33.210
SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE

MOBILITY THROUGH THE L. A. METRO

00:43:35.412 --> 00:43:35.846
SYSTEM AND THEN WE HAVE

00:43:35.913 --> 00:43:37.348
TRIBUTARIES THAT WILL ALSO OFFER

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:38.949
FUTURE SPINE INTERNET

00:43:39.016 --> 00:43:39.883
CONNECTIVITY. THE MANY

00:43:39.950 --> 00:43:41.752
NEIGHBORHOODS WE CAN GREEN UP

00:43:41.819 --> 00:43:43.120
THESE AREAS MANY OF WHICH ARE

00:43:43.187 --> 00:43:44.855
PART POOR. AND SO I THINK THAT

00:43:44.922 --> 00:43:46.590
THAT IS A VERY PRUDENT

00:43:46.657 --> 00:43:48.625
INVESTMENT TO DOUBLE DOWN ON THE

00:43:48.692 --> 00:43:49.927
HUGE INVESTMENTS OF THE CITY OF

00:44:10.347 --> 00:44:12.282
COMMITTEE CHAIRED BY YOU MISTER

00:44:12.349 --> 00:44:13.951
BLUMEN AND THE STAFF AS IS

00:44:14.018 --> 00:44:16.587
GENERALLY EARNED MY RESPECT- IN

00:44:16.653 --> 00:44:18.088
TERMS OF HANDLING A LOT OF

00:44:18.155 --> 00:44:19.990
COMPLICATED ISSUES AND THE WAY

00:44:20.057 --> 00:44:22.259
WE RUN THE MEETINGS AND THEN THE

00:44:22.326 --> 00:44:23.160
PRESENTATIONS THAT WE'VE MADE I

00:44:23.227 --> 00:44:24.962
FELT AS A NEW MEMBER JOINING US

00:44:25.029 --> 00:44:26.797
JOINING A VERY. SMOOTH RUNNING

00:44:26.864 --> 00:44:29.133
OPERATION SO THANK YOU

00:44:29.199 --> 00:44:31.435
SINCERELY- I ONLY WANT TO

00:44:31.502 --> 00:44:33.604
MENTION TWO THINGS ONE THE

00:44:33.670 --> 00:44:36.640
IMPENDING- PEAK HOUR GRID

00:44:36.707 --> 00:44:39.143
SHORTAGE THAT- THE GOVERNOR HAS

00:44:39.209 --> 00:44:42.579
RECENTLY MADE US AWARE OF- I.

00:44:42.646 --> 00:44:44.581
BELIEVE THAT- YOU KNOW ONE

00:44:44.648 --> 00:44:46.050
APPROACH TO THAT IS STIFF

00:44:46.116 --> 00:44:48.685
CONTINUE FOSSIL FUEL- BUT I

00:44:48.752 --> 00:44:50.854
THINK ANOTHER APPROACH THAT- I

00:44:50.921 --> 00:44:53.323
HOPE WE CAN MAXIMIZE IS THAT THE

00:44:53.390 --> 00:44:55.492
MORE STORAGE WE HAVE THE MORE WE

00:44:55.559 --> 00:44:57.795
CAN STORE THE ENERGY THAT- WE

00:44:57.861 --> 00:44:59.696
HAVE AN ACCESS DURING NON PEAK

00:44:59.763 --> 00:45:02.566
HOURS- THE BETTER OFF WE'LL BE

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.169
DURING THOSE SHORTAGE PERIODS IN

00:45:05.235 --> 00:45:06.303
THE LAST- FOSSIL FUEL

00:45:06.370 --> 00:45:08.205
CONSIDERABLE KEEP ONLINE. SO

00:45:08.272 --> 00:45:12.342
GIVE AN EXAMPLE I HOPE THAT THE

00:45:12.409 --> 00:45:13.444
ADMINISTRATION. WELL WILL DO

00:45:13.510 --> 00:45:16.113
SAYING THAT PRIORITIZE PROJECTS

00:45:16.180 --> 00:45:19.616
THAT HAVE STORAGE FOR EXAMPLE-

00:45:19.683 --> 00:45:22.052
EVEY CHARGING STATIONS IF WE

00:45:22.119 --> 00:45:23.520
COULD PRIORITIZE EVEY CHARGING

00:45:23.587 --> 00:45:25.489
STATIONS THAT ALSO INCLUDES

00:45:25.556 --> 00:45:28.358
STORAGE IN THEIR PLANNING SO

00:45:28.425 --> 00:45:30.194
THAT WE COULD COUNT ON THEM TO

00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:32.029
USE THEIR STORIES AT EIGHT

00:45:32.096 --> 00:45:32.930
O'CLOCK IN THE EVENING DURING

00:45:32.996 --> 00:45:34.998
PEAK HOURS AND THEY COULD CHARGE

00:45:35.065 --> 00:45:37.968
UP THE THERE- THEIR BATTERIES

00:45:38.035 --> 00:45:40.370
DURING NON PEAK HOURS- THE OTHER

00:45:40.437 --> 00:45:42.506
THING THAT I WOULD JUST. HOPE

00:45:42.573 --> 00:45:45.142
THAT WE CAN PRIORITIZE IS- JUST

00:45:45.209 --> 00:45:48.078
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KEEP

00:45:48.145 --> 00:45:50.380
PLANNING AHEAD DURING THE

00:45:50.447 --> 00:45:52.216
PRESENTATION OF THE GOVERNOR

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:54.184
SAID PROPOSAL WE WERE TOLD IT

00:45:54.251 --> 00:45:56.453
TAKES SIX YEARS ON AVERAGE FOR

00:45:56.520 --> 00:45:59.123
THESE PROJECTS TO COME ONLINE-

00:45:59.189 --> 00:46:01.191
AND IF IT TAKES SIX YEARS WE

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.559
SHOULD MAKE SURE WE'RE PLANNING

00:46:02.626 --> 00:46:05.395
SIX YEARS OUT- AND THAT MEANS

00:46:05.462 --> 00:46:08.031
EVERY AGENCY THAT IS INVOLVED

00:46:08.098 --> 00:46:10.234
NEEDS TO HAVE US AS A STRONG

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:11.902
SENSE OF ACCOUNTABILITY TO THAT

00:46:11.969 --> 00:46:14.071
LONG RANGE PLANNING. AND WITH

00:46:14.138 --> 00:46:16.106
THOSE TWO THINGS L. RELINQUISH

00:46:16.173 --> 00:46:19.409
THE REST OF MY TIME THANK YOU

00:46:19.476 --> 00:46:20.577
VERY MUCH THANK YOU ASSEMBLY

00:46:20.644 --> 00:46:24.181
MEMBER. MR FONG. I THANK YOU

00:46:24.248 --> 00:46:28.619
MISTER CHAIR- MY REVIEW OF THE

00:46:28.685 --> 00:46:31.688
MAY REVISION- I THINK HIGHLIGHTS

00:46:31.755 --> 00:46:33.757
THE FACT THAT I THINK THERE ARE

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:35.092
SIGNIFICANT MISSED OPPORTUNITIES

00:46:35.159 --> 00:46:37.494
ON SEVERAL VITAL ISSUES- WHICH

00:46:37.561 --> 00:46:39.696
RIGHT NOW IN OUR STATE WE'RE AT

00:46:39.763 --> 00:46:41.698
CRISIS LEVELS CALIFORNIANS ARE

00:46:41.765 --> 00:46:43.066
FACING THE THIRD YEAR OF A

00:46:43.133 --> 00:46:45.202
DEVASTATING DROUGHT. THE BONE

00:46:45.269 --> 00:46:46.637
DRY A DROUGHT CONDITIONS WILL

00:46:46.703 --> 00:46:48.739
pMAKE OUR ENERGY CRISIS FAR WORSE

00:46:48.805 --> 00:46:50.474
ROLLING BLACKOUTS ARE A LIKELY

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.943
POSSIBILITY GAS PRICES ARE OVER

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.678
SIX DOLLARS PER GALLON- IT WILL

00:46:54.745 --> 00:46:56.446
INCREASE UNFORTUNATELY ON JULY

00:46:56.513 --> 00:46:59.316
FIRST BECAUSE OF THE INACTION OF

00:46:59.383 --> 00:46:59.850
THE LEGISLATURE AND WATER

00:46:59.917 --> 00:47:01.351
RESERVES ARE DRAINING. THE

00:47:01.418 --> 00:47:03.620
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION FAILS TO

00:47:03.687 --> 00:47:05.989
ADEQUATELY ADDRESS THE CRITICAL

00:47:06.056 --> 00:47:07.958
NEEDS EVERYBODY WILL WHILE BY

00:47:08.025 --> 00:47:10.093
PREVENTION TO WATER STORAGE TO

00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.663
GAS PRICES- AND THE IMMEDIATE

00:47:12.729 --> 00:47:14.364
RELIEF THAT'S NECESSARY THERE

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.099
WHILE BY PREVENTION FUNDING

00:47:16.166 --> 00:47:18.602
ACTUALLY DECREASED FROM LAST

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:21.405
YEAR- WHERE THE BUDGET HAVE ONE

00:47:21.471 --> 00:47:23.207
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IT

00:47:23.273 --> 00:47:24.975
NOW GOES TO SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:47:25.042 --> 00:47:26.577
DOLLARS THERE'S NO FUNDING FOR

00:47:26.643 --> 00:47:28.245
ABOVE GROUND WATER STORAGE THIS

00:47:28.312 --> 00:47:31.148
YEAR. AND THE STATE'S SHARE OF

00:47:31.215 --> 00:47:32.382
THE DIESEL SALES TAX IS BEING

00:47:32.449 --> 00:47:34.585
SUSPENDED BUT NO IMMEDIATE GAS

00:47:34.651 --> 00:47:36.186
TAX RELIEF FOR THE EVERYDAY

00:47:36.253 --> 00:47:38.789
CALIFORNIA AS CONDITIONS GET

00:47:38.855 --> 00:47:41.158
GRAMMAR CALIFORNIANS CANNOT

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:43.360
AFFORD TO WAIT ANOTHER THREE

00:47:43.427 --> 00:47:44.695
YEARS FOR WATERS FOR NEW WATER

00:47:44.761 --> 00:47:45.262
STORAGE AND THEY CERTAINLY

00:47:45.329 --> 00:47:46.797
CANNOT WAIT OUT ANOTHER WILDFIRE

00:47:46.863 --> 00:47:49.366
SEASON BEFORE THE STATE COMMITS

00:47:49.433 --> 00:47:51.501
TO SERIOUS WILDFIRE PREVENTION I

00:47:51.568 --> 00:47:52.869
RECENTLY WAS IN THE SEQUOIA

00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:55.239
NATIONAL FOREST 19% OF OUR

00:47:55.305 --> 00:47:57.975
ICONIC. GIANT SEQUOIAS HAVE BEEN

00:47:58.041 --> 00:48:01.979
DESTROYED. IF WE DON'T. ACTIVELY

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:07.351
STREAMLINED- PREVENTION. ARE WE

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:09.286
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE EXISTS AS A

00:48:09.353 --> 00:48:10.988
STATE FOR ALLOWING ALL OUR GIANT

00:48:11.054 --> 00:48:13.090
SEQUOIAS TO BE DESTROYED AND

00:48:13.156 --> 00:48:15.425
TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE EVEN MORE

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:16.593
IN THE IMMEDIATE FUTURE IS THE

00:48:16.660 --> 00:48:17.928
GAS TAX INCREASE GOING INTO

00:48:17.995 --> 00:48:20.264
EFFECT ON JULY FIRST

00:48:20.330 --> 00:48:21.331
CALIFORNIANS ARE HURTING AS OUR

00:48:21.398 --> 00:48:23.467
FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS GROW. THE

00:48:23.533 --> 00:48:25.035
NEED FOR SUSPENDING THE GAS TAX

00:48:25.102 --> 00:48:26.770
IS IMMEDIATE AND WITH MORE AND

00:48:26.837 --> 00:48:28.572
MORE STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY

00:48:28.639 --> 00:48:30.374
TAKING ACTION CALIFORNIA IT

00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:32.342
SHOULD DO THE SAME I WILL ALSO

00:48:32.409 --> 00:48:33.977
SAY THAT WE NEED TO ALLOW FOR

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:35.545
MORE ENERGY PRODUCTION

00:48:35.612 --> 00:48:36.980
ESPECIALLY IN THE AREAS OF OIL

00:48:37.047 --> 00:48:40.217
AND NATURAL GAS CALIFORNIA. IS A

00:48:40.284 --> 00:48:42.786
ENERGY ISLAND. IF OTHER STATES

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.821
INCREASE THEIR OIL NATURAL GAS

00:48:44.888 --> 00:48:46.356
PRODUCTION TO SECURE THEIR

00:48:46.423 --> 00:48:48.759
ENERGY SUPPLY. IT DOES NOT MEAN

00:48:48.825 --> 00:48:50.460
THAT THAT PRODUCTION WILL COME

00:48:50.527 --> 00:48:52.095
TO CALIFORNIA WE DON'T HAVE THE

00:48:52.162 --> 00:48:53.397
PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:55.432
TRANSPORTATION COSTS MAKE IT

00:48:55.499 --> 00:49:00.570
ECONOMICALLY- YEAH OUT OF THAT

00:49:00.637 --> 00:49:01.338
DOESN'T ALLOW IT TO ECONOMICALLY

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:04.174
PENCIL OUT. SO WE HAVE TO DO. A

00:49:04.241 --> 00:49:06.877
PRODUCTION HERE. IN CALIFORNIA

00:49:06.943 --> 00:49:08.879
THIS HAS TO BE A PRIORITY. AND

00:49:08.945 --> 00:49:12.149
NOT- AND WHEN WE AS A STATE

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:13.183
CANNOT BE PUTTING UP ADDITIONAL

00:49:13.250 --> 00:49:14.818
ROADBLOCKS. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T

00:49:14.885 --> 00:49:19.056
ACT. THEN THE FOREIGN RELIANCE.

00:49:19.122 --> 00:49:22.225
ON ENERGY SUPPLY IN OIL NATURAL

00:49:22.292 --> 00:49:23.994
GAS AS A STATE IN CALIFORNIA

00:49:24.061 --> 00:49:25.762
WILL ONLY GO UP. AND I HEAR THIS

00:49:25.829 --> 00:49:27.331
FROM BOTH SIDES OF THE AISLE

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:28.465
THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.600
FOREIGN RELIANCE ON ENERGY BUT

00:49:30.667 --> 00:49:32.836
IT'S BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES-

00:49:32.903 --> 00:49:34.304
AND THE LACK OF INVESTMENT IN

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:36.406
ENERGY PRODUCTION IN. IN IN THE

00:49:36.473 --> 00:49:38.275
OIL AND NATURAL GAS SPACE THAT

00:49:38.342 --> 00:49:40.610
IS ONLY MAKE THAT WORSE. SO WE

00:49:40.677 --> 00:49:41.878
HAVE A LESS THAN A MONTH TO PUT

00:49:41.945 --> 00:49:43.747
TOGETHER A BUDGET THAT PROVIDES

00:49:43.814 --> 00:49:46.416
REAL SOLUTIONS. HONEST RESPONSES

00:49:46.483 --> 00:49:47.050
TO THE PROBLEMS FACING

00:49:47.117 --> 00:49:49.453
CALIFORNIA'S I HOPE THAT THERE

00:49:49.519 --> 00:49:51.321
WILL BE ADDITIONAL HEARINGS- I

00:49:51.388 --> 00:49:52.923
HOPE THAT WILL BE A CONFERENCE

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:54.424
COMMITTEE THAT WE CAN. HAVE

00:49:54.491 --> 00:49:56.793
BEFORE THE PUBLIC- AND HAVE THIS

00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.095
AND HAVE MORE DISCUSSIONS ON

00:49:58.161 --> 00:49:59.730
THIS AT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO

00:49:59.796 --> 00:50:01.264
CONNECT. AT TO WILDFIRE

00:50:01.331 --> 00:50:03.300
PREVENTION IT NEEDS TO COMMIT TO

00:50:03.367 --> 00:50:05.869
INVESTING AND WATER STORAGE NEW

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:07.204
AND ADDITIONAL WATER STORAGE

00:50:07.270 --> 00:50:10.107
NOW. AND GIVING DRIVERS A TAX

00:50:10.173 --> 00:50:15.212

MESSAGE ON THAT. IS BECAUSE THEY

01:21:22.644 --> 01:21:24.079
ARE SO. TO THINK OF THE MAYOR.

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:25.347
PER IN CON. OF YOUR

01:21:25.413 --> 01:21:26.514
TRANSPORTATION. A PACKAGE

01:21:26.581 --> 01:21:28.917
DECISIONS- AND MAKE SURE THAT

01:21:28.984 --> 01:21:30.185
THOSE DECISIONS ALIGN WITH EACH

01:21:30.252 --> 01:21:32.354
OTHER. ON THE RESOURCES SIDE

01:21:32.420 --> 01:21:35.323
THERE IS A LOT- A LOT OF FUNDING

01:21:35.390 --> 01:21:37.292
MAJOR INCREASES NEARLY ALL ONE

01:21:37.359 --> 01:21:39.628
TIME. SOME IS FOCUSED ON

01:21:39.694 --> 01:21:41.496
IMMEDIATE- PRESSING NEEDS THINGS

01:21:41.563 --> 01:21:43.932
LIKE DROUGHT WILDFIRES AND

01:21:43.999 --> 01:21:45.166
POTENTIAL ENERGY SHORTAGES THE

01:21:45.233 --> 01:21:47.302
THAT WE MAY SEE THIS SUMMER. AND

01:21:47.369 --> 01:21:48.937
SOME. QUITE A BIT OF IT FOCUSES

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:51.139
ON LONGER TERM AT- CHALLENGES

01:21:51.206 --> 01:21:53.942
AND STATE GOALS LIKE ENERGY-

01:21:54.009 --> 01:21:55.744
DECARBONISATION AS WELL AS WATER

01:21:55.810 --> 01:21:57.946
RELIABILITY. SO OVERALL WE THINK

01:21:58.013 --> 01:21:59.581
THE GOVERNOR'S FOCUSES ON A

01:21:59.648 --> 01:22:00.782
REASONABLE SET OF ISSUES WE

01:22:00.849 --> 01:22:02.550
THINK THERE'S MERIT IN FOCUSING

01:22:02.617 --> 01:22:04.252
ON CLIMATE RELATED CHALLENGES WE

01:22:04.319 --> 01:22:06.087
THINK THERE'S MERIT IN A- HAVING

01:22:06.154 --> 01:22:07.789
A MIX OF SHORT AND LONGER TERM

01:22:07.856 --> 01:22:09.724
ACTIVITIES- AS WELL AS FOCUSING

01:22:09.791 --> 01:22:11.860
ON ONE TIME RATHER THAN GONE

01:22:11.926 --> 01:22:14.863
GOING. ACTIVITIES BECAUSE- OF

01:22:14.929 --> 01:22:16.197
SOME OF THE FUTURE BUDGET

01:22:16.264 --> 01:22:17.832
UNCERTAINTIES SO JUST A MOMENT

01:22:17.899 --> 01:22:20.769
ON THAT. IT THE OVERALL APPROACH

01:22:20.835 --> 01:22:23.071
YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU THIS YEAR IS

01:22:23.138 --> 01:22:24.139
A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT BECAUSE

01:22:24.205 --> 01:22:25.640
OF THIS NEW EMERGING ISSUE OF

01:22:25.707 --> 01:22:27.409
THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:30.445
FOR SAL. CONSTRAINTS ACCORDING

01:22:30.512 --> 01:22:32.881
TO THE CONSTITUTION IS A NEED TO

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:34.082
SPEND A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

01:22:34.149 --> 01:22:35.684
FUNDING ON WHAT ARE CONSIDERED

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:38.720
SALIX GLUTAMYL ACTIVITIES OR TAX

01:22:38.787 --> 01:22:40.655
REFUNDS SO AB. ACTIVITIES THAT

01:22:40.722 --> 01:22:42.424
ARE EXCLUDABLE FROM THAT LIMIT

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:43.892
OR THINGS LIKE CAPITAL OUTLAY.

01:22:43.958 --> 01:22:45.827
AND EMERGENCY SPENDING SO YOU'VE

01:22:45.894 --> 01:22:48.129
GOT QUITE A BIT OF THAT IN THIS

01:22:48.196 --> 01:22:49.064
SUB COMMITTEE- BUT THEN THERE

01:22:49.130 --> 01:22:50.865
ARE ALSO PROPOSALS THAT ARE THAT

01:22:50.932 --> 01:22:52.600
ARE SUBJECT TO THE LIMIT. I WE

01:22:52.667 --> 01:22:54.235
WANT TO HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU THAT

01:22:54.302 --> 01:22:55.804
WE THINK THERE'S ABOUT THREE

01:22:55.870 --> 01:22:56.905
POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS

01:22:56.971 --> 01:22:58.940
UNADDRESSED SELL REQUIREMENTS IN

01:22:59.007 --> 01:23:00.542
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. WE

01:23:00.608 --> 01:23:02.777
STRONGLY RECOMMEND THAT YOU- DO

01:23:02.844 --> 01:23:04.512
NOT PASS A BUDGET THAT DOESN'T

01:23:04.579 --> 01:23:05.780
ADDRESS THOSE ROOT. IN PART

01:23:05.847 --> 01:23:07.882
BECAUSE OF WHAT IT SETTING FOR

01:23:07.949 --> 01:23:10.952
BUDGET YEAR PLUS ONE. AT TWENTY

01:23:11.019 --> 01:23:12.887
THREE TWENTY FOUR WE HAVE SOME

01:23:12.954 --> 01:23:14.356
CONCERNS AB TO HIGHLIGHT FOR

01:23:14.422 --> 01:23:16.391
YOU. AND KIND OF TWO PARTS ONE

01:23:16.458 --> 01:23:19.627
IS RELATED TO THE SOUTH WE SEE

01:23:19.694 --> 01:23:21.196
PRETTY SIGNIFICANT SALVAR

01:23:21.262 --> 01:23:23.064
FIREMAN'S INTO THREE TWENTY FOUR

01:23:23.131 --> 01:23:24.933
ABOUT TWENTY BILLION DOLLARS IS

01:23:24.999 --> 01:23:26.601
OUR CURRENT ESTIMATE. AND WE'RE

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:27.268
NOT FORECASTING THE SIZE OF THE

01:23:27.335 --> 01:23:29.104
SURPLUS THAT YOU HAVE RIGHT NOW

01:23:29.170 --> 01:23:30.105
WE'RE ONLY FORECASTING ABOUT A

01:23:30.171 --> 01:23:31.773
TWO BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS SO WE

01:23:31.840 --> 01:23:34.642
THINK YOU MAY FACE A REALLY BIG

01:23:34.709 --> 01:23:35.243
CHALLENGE AND HOW YOU ADDRESS

01:23:35.310 --> 01:23:36.378
THOSE REQUIREMENTS IN BUDGET

01:23:36.444 --> 01:23:38.747
YOUR PLUS ONE. ONE WAY TO DO TO

01:23:38.813 --> 01:23:40.749
PREPARE FOR THAT IS TO PUT MORE

01:23:40.815 --> 01:23:42.183
FUNDING AND RESERVES SO TO THE

01:23:42.250 --> 01:23:44.619
DEGREE YOU CAN LOOK AT YOUR KIND

01:23:44.686 --> 01:23:46.388
OF NON SALLY EXCLUDABLE

01:23:46.454 --> 01:23:49.090
ACTIVITIES. AND TRY AND FIND

01:23:49.157 --> 01:23:51.126
ADDITIONAL FUNDING AND THAT SIDE

01:23:51.192 --> 01:23:52.060
OF THE BUDGET TO PUT INTO

01:23:52.127 --> 01:23:53.962
RESERVES WE THINK IT WILL PUT

01:23:54.028 --> 01:23:55.196
YOU IN A BETTER POSITION- COMING

01:23:55.263 --> 01:23:58.533
TO BUDGET. PLUS ONE. ALL WORSE

01:23:58.600 --> 01:23:59.934
SOME PRETTY CONCERNING SIGNS OF

01:24:00.001 --> 01:24:04.305
A- RECESSION ON THE HORIZON- SO

01:24:04.372 --> 01:24:06.408
WE ALSO THINK THAT THAT IS YET

01:24:06.474 --> 01:24:07.876
ANOTHER REASON TO. GIVEN THAT

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:10.645
UNCERTAINTY TO TRY AND PUT

01:24:10.712 --> 01:24:12.113
YOURSELF IN A BETTER POSITION.

01:24:12.180 --> 01:24:14.849
SO THE STORE ON ON YOUR BY

01:24:14.916 --> 01:24:16.584
THINKING ABOUT THE EXCLUDABLE

01:24:16.651 --> 01:24:17.452
ACT AND THEN EXCLUDABLE IS SLOW

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:19.988
DIFFERENT- BUT OVERALL WE

01:24:20.054 --> 01:24:20.789
CONTINUE TO STAY FOCUSED ON YOUR

01:24:20.855 --> 01:24:22.190
PRIORITIES IN YOUR PRIORITIES

01:24:22.257 --> 01:24:24.392
MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE

01:24:24.459 --> 01:24:25.660
GOVERNOR'S AS AS WAS EVEN NOTED

01:24:25.727 --> 01:24:26.961
EARLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE-

01:24:27.028 --> 01:24:29.097
YOU MAY WANT TO SPEND MORE ON.

01:24:29.164 --> 01:24:31.433
WILDLIFE ARE ON WATER STORAGE-

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:33.902
AND LESS ON SOME THE GOVERNOR'S

01:24:33.968 --> 01:24:35.904
PRIORITY SO USED YOU ALWAYS HAVE

01:24:35.970 --> 01:24:37.338
THAT. TO MAKE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS

01:24:37.405 --> 01:24:39.808
BOTH ON THE EXCLUDABLE SIDE AS

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:42.310
WELL AS THE NON EXCLUDABLE SIDE.

01:24:42.377 --> 01:24:42.911
SOME OTHER CONSIDERATIONS WITH

01:24:42.977 --> 01:24:44.245
THAT SUGGEST THINKING ABOUT OUR

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:47.215
CAPACITY FOR DE. AND LOCALS TO

01:24:47.282 --> 01:24:48.750
IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS

01:24:48.817 --> 01:24:50.785
ESPECIALLY GIVEN LARGE

01:24:50.852 --> 01:24:52.787
INVESTMENTS RECENTLY- IF THERE

01:24:52.854 --> 01:24:55.356
ARE NEW. NEW PER. ESPECIALLY ON

01:24:55.423 --> 01:24:56.891
THE NON X. SIDE THAT ARE

01:24:56.958 --> 01:25:00.094
PROPOSED ME- HAVE A MUCH HIGHER

01:25:00.161 --> 01:25:02.263
WE WOULD SEE HAVE A HIGHER FOR

01:25:02.330 --> 01:25:03.531
CAN. WE TO THOSE ARE NOT SPENT

01:25:03.598 --> 01:25:05.600
GIVEN THE TRADE OFFS- TIMING HOW

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.569
QUICKLY DO YOU NEED TO MAKE SOME

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:09.370
OF THESE DECISIONS- SPECIAL ON

01:25:09.437 --> 01:25:11.239
THE TRAILER BILL SIDE BUT BUT

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:11.973
ALSO FOR SOME OF THESE LARGE

01:25:12.040 --> 01:25:14.442
INVESTMENTS- WHAT. DO YOU NEED

01:25:14.509 --> 01:25:17.212
TO DECIDE THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND

01:25:17.278 --> 01:25:18.580
WHAT COULD TAKE EITHER A FEW

01:25:18.646 --> 01:25:19.747
MONTHS THIS SUMMER OR MAYBE

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:21.783
ABOUT DEFERRING SOME DECISIONS

01:25:21.850 --> 01:25:24.986
UNTIL NEXT YEAR- WE SUGGEST

01:25:25.053 --> 01:25:26.387
THINKING ABOUT REPORTING

01:25:26.454 --> 01:25:27.755
LANGUAGE AND EVALUATION

01:25:27.822 --> 01:25:29.290
ESPECIALLY FOR SOME OF THE NEW

01:25:29.357 --> 01:25:30.792
PROGRAMS TO MAKE SURE YOU

01:25:30.859 --> 01:25:31.826
UNDERSTAND WHAT HE WHAT. WE'RE

01:25:31.893 --> 01:25:33.094
GETTING FROM OUR STATE

01:25:33.161 --> 01:25:35.129
EXPENDITURES- AND TO INFORM

01:25:35.196 --> 01:25:37.165
FUTURE INVESTMENTS. AND THEN

01:25:37.232 --> 01:25:38.700
FINALLY JUST A COMMENT ABOUT THE

01:25:38.766 --> 01:25:39.868
GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND AS

01:25:39.934 --> 01:25:41.469
ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN-

01:25:41.536 --> 01:25:43.505
MENTIONED WE DO THINK THERE IS.

01:25:43.571 --> 01:25:45.173
OPPORTUNITY TO USE G. JEFF AND

01:25:45.240 --> 01:25:46.508
GENERAL FUND STRATEGICALLY IN

01:25:46.574 --> 01:25:48.076
PART TO HELP WITH SOME OF THE

01:25:48.142 --> 01:25:49.978
CELL REQUIREMENTS THINKING ABOUT

01:25:50.044 --> 01:25:51.212
WHICH ACTIVITIES ARE FUNDED WITH

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:54.048

R. F. AVAILABLE BEYOND WHAT'S IN

01:25:58.453 --> 01:25:59.921
THE GOVERNOR'S PACKAGE WE THINK

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.456
THERE'S ABOUT. BASED ON OUR

01:26:01.523 --> 01:26:02.056
HIGHER REVENUE ESTIMATES ABOUT

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:03.658
ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION YOU

01:26:03.725 --> 01:26:05.760
MIGHT HAVE AVAILABLE TO SPEND-

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.095
ON DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES.

01:26:07.161 --> 01:26:08.796
WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

01:26:08.863 --> 01:26:12.133

01:26:15.937 --> 01:26:18.106
QUICK STATEMENT I'D LIKE TO MAKE

01:26:18.172 --> 01:26:19.407
ABOUT. OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:19.474 --> 01:26:20.808
PROPOSALS ON THE- CLEAN ENERGY.

CLEAN ENERGY. AND PREVENTING

01:26:26.214 --> 01:26:27.782
DISRUPTIONS ARE AT TOP AND

01:26:27.849 --> 01:26:30.451
URGENT PRIORITY- OF. ALL

AND GET THIS DONE. GIVEN THE

01:26:43.031 --> 01:26:44.966
URGENCY. BUT IT JUST SEEMS TO ME

01:26:45.033 --> 01:26:47.068
THAT WITHOUT PUBLIC INPUT. I

01:26:47.135 --> 01:26:49.103
DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN GET IT

01:26:49.170 --> 01:26:50.004

WHAT ARE THE ASSETS. YEAH I

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:45.145
STOOD THERE ARE. BROADLY AT.

01:39:45.212 --> 01:39:46.513
THREE STRATEGIES THAT THE DEVICE

HAS. SAID IN A TALK TO ONE BY

01:39:48.682 --> 01:39:50.684
ONE SO THE FIRST ONE IS THAT THE

01:39:50.751 --> 01:39:51.852
W. R. IT'S ABOUT FOUR FOUR POINT

01:39:51.919 --> 01:39:55.389
TWO BILLION UP FORTY W. R. APPLE

01:39:55.456 --> 01:39:57.991
. STRATEGIC RESERVE AT SWITCHING

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:59.927
. BROADLY THINGS- ONE TO KEEP.

01:39:59.993 --> 01:40:00.861
OUR THOSE RESOURCE THAT ARE

01:40:00.928 --> 01:40:02.730
CRITICAL FOR TYERMAN THAT COULD

01:40:02.796 --> 01:40:05.099
BE HELD ON. IN THIS OUT OF MY-

01:40:05.165 --> 01:40:07.868
INSURANCE. ARE A SECOND PART OF

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:08.736
THE STRATEGIC ASSETS WOULD

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:10.971
INCLUDE. BUILDING ARE BRINGING

01:40:11.038 --> 01:40:13.340
IN MORE SKILLED IN THE GROUND-

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:15.609
SIMILAR TO. WHAT THE IDEA OF

01:40:15.676 --> 01:40:16.910
YOUR HAVE DONE PREVIOUSLY BUT

01:40:16.977 --> 01:40:19.747
IT'S BEEN PRETTY- BEST GENSETS

01:40:19.813 --> 01:40:22.983
OR- OUT OF MARKET. AFTER CLEAN

01:40:23.050 --> 01:40:25.018
ENERGY AT PEOPLE THIRTEEN THAT

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:26.954
SO THERE ARE TWO BUCKETS THERE.

01:40:27.020 --> 01:40:30.157
FOR CC- WE HAVE ABOUT NINE

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:31.692
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. IN IN

01:40:31.759 --> 01:40:33.794
ENSURING THAT WE HAVE THE WHAT.

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:35.462
DISTRIBUTED ACTIVITY BACKUPS-

01:40:35.529 --> 01:40:37.731
BUT OFFICERS WELL AS I SAID

01:40:37.798 --> 01:40:39.733
APPLE. TO THE DISTRIBUTED ENERGY

01:40:39.800 --> 01:40:41.602
BACK ABOUT THAT INCLUDES THREE

01:40:41.668 --> 01:40:44.338
COMPONENTS. SO ONE WOULD BE. ALL

01:40:44.405 --> 01:40:46.540
THREE ARE ARE AIMED AT- THEY- ON

01:40:46.607 --> 01:40:47.174
BACK OF GENERATION IN

WHICH IS ABOUT FOURTEEN THOUSAND

01:40:50.210 --> 01:40:52.579
MEGAWATTS. TO DEPEND ON THEM

01:40:52.646 --> 01:40:53.714
GETTING GETTING EMERGENCY

01:40:53.781 --> 01:40:55.349
SITUATIONS SO THE FIRST ONE OF

01:40:55.416 --> 01:40:57.718
THAT WOULD BE. PROVIDING A

01:40:57.785 --> 01:40:59.853
MEDICATION EQUIPMENT CLICK I SEE

01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.789
ARE STILL PUT ON EXISTING-

01:41:01.855 --> 01:41:03.590
GENSETS THAT COULD BE AVAILABLE

01:41:03.657 --> 01:41:06.026
BY DOING EMERGENCIES AT TWO IT

01:41:06.093 --> 01:41:08.362
STARTED TO. FUNDING SO PROVIDING

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:10.464
INCENTIVES FOR EARLY PLACEMENT

01:41:10.531 --> 01:41:12.433
OF. A POSSIBLE- BACK GENERATORS

01:41:12.499 --> 01:41:14.201
BUT BRINGING THEM INTO A CLEAN

01:41:14.268 --> 01:41:16.637
PORTFOLIO BUT ALSO FUNDING NEW

BACK OF GENERATIONS THAT ARE

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:19.807
CLEAN. AT FACILITIES THAT ARE

01:41:19.873 --> 01:41:21.575
STRATEGIC AND NEED. AND THE

01:41:21.642 --> 01:41:23.143
SECOND ELEMENT OF THAT WOULD BE

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:26.013
ON THE SUPPLY SIDE- PUTTING. IN

01:41:26.079 --> 01:41:27.815
ADDITIONAL GENERATION CLEAN

01:41:27.881 --> 01:41:30.417
GENERATION EXISTING FACILITIES

01:41:30.484 --> 01:41:31.885
THAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN ABILITY

01:41:31.952 --> 01:41:34.188
OPPORTUNITY. BUT ALSO INCREASING

01:41:34.254 --> 01:41:36.723
THE OVERALL. EFFICIENCY OF THE

01:41:36.790 --> 01:41:49.002
EXISTING THERMAL. POWER AND TO

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:50.737
THINK OUT A LITTLE BIT MORE. AND

01:41:50.804 --> 01:41:52.172
THE ELEMENT THANKS FOR DEMAND

01:41:52.239 --> 01:41:53.307
FOR SUPPORT. WHICH OF THE

01:41:53.373 --> 01:41:55.576

VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT. IN IN

01:42:00.914 --> 01:42:02.416
IN TERMS OF THE DIESELS TEXAS-

01:42:02.483 --> 01:42:04.084
IF YOU'RE GOING TO SPEND THE

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:05.219
SALE TAX OF DIESEL IS

01:42:05.285 --> 01:42:06.353
DEPARTMENT. YOU CAN ASSIST THE

01:42:06.420 --> 01:42:07.521
STATE'S OF THE DIESEL SELL

01:42:07.588 --> 01:42:08.822
THAT'S WHY DO THE SUSPENSION FOR

01:42:08.889 --> 01:42:12.125
AND GASOLINE. ARM SO JACOB KERN

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:14.862
A FIVE- THE WE DECIDED GO WITH

01:42:14.928 --> 01:42:18.432
THE D. SALES. I'M FOR NOT THREE

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:20.367
THE FIRST ONE THAT. THE STATE

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.402
ACTUALLY DOESN'T APPLY A-

01:42:22.469 --> 01:42:24.805
GENERAL FUND TAX RATE ON THE

01:42:24.872 --> 01:42:26.740
SALE OF GAS. THERE ARE OTHER

01:42:26.807 --> 01:42:28.809
SALES TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO

01:42:28.876 --> 01:42:31.411
GASOLINE SALES BY DUSTIN FOR THE

01:42:31.478 --> 01:42:32.846
LOCALS AND SO WE DON'T

01:42:32.913 --> 01:42:34.781
NECESSARILY HAVE THE SAME AMOUNT

01:42:34.848 --> 01:42:37.651
OF CONTROL OVER- GAS TAX

01:42:37.718 --> 01:42:38.685
REVENUES FOR GENERAL FUND

01:42:38.752 --> 01:42:41.788
PURPOSES. AS WE DO PRODUCE OR

01:42:41.855 --> 01:42:44.458
AVENUES. YEAH OTHER PART OF THE-

01:42:44.525 --> 01:42:49.096
OKAY WAS BAD. THAT GAP OUR BUT

01:42:49.162 --> 01:42:50.497
HISTORICAL DIESEL AND GASOLINE

01:42:50.564 --> 01:42:52.099
PRICE RIGHT NOW IS EXTREMELY

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:54.201
HIGH AND THAT'S BECAUSE WE HAVE

01:42:54.268 --> 01:42:56.169
A LOT OF COUNTRIES THAT USE

01:42:56.236 --> 01:42:57.471
DIESEL FOR A HIGHER PROPORTION

01:42:57.538 --> 01:42:59.172
OF THEIR VEHICLES I'M NOT GOING

01:42:59.239 --> 01:43:01.775
THROUGH A BIT OF A SUPPLY CRUNCH

01:43:01.842 --> 01:43:02.876
RIGHT NOW AND SO THE GAP BETWEEN

01:43:02.943 --> 01:43:04.478
GAYS ALL AND- GASOLINE PRICES

01:43:04.545 --> 01:43:06.280
HAS GROWN TO HISTORICALLY HIGH

01:43:06.346 --> 01:43:09.216
LEVELS. WE THOUGHT DIESEL NEEDED

01:43:09.283 --> 01:43:12.853
SOME EXTRA ATTENTION. SPECIALLY

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:14.555
GIVEN THE DIRECT IMPACT DIESEL

01:43:14.621 --> 01:43:17.424
CAN HAVE ALL AND I'M GONNA TO

01:43:17.491 --> 01:43:18.191
INFLATION BECAUSE DIESELS

01:43:18.258 --> 01:43:19.726
OBVIOUSLY TO TRANSPORT A LOT OF

01:43:19.793 --> 01:43:22.963
FRIENDS AROUND- AND SURVEYS THAT

01:43:23.030 --> 01:43:25.499
IS A BIG CONTRIBUTOR TO THE

01:43:25.566 --> 01:43:27.301
PRICE OF- CONSUMER GUIDES TO SO

01:43:27.367 --> 01:43:28.835
THAT'S THE PERFECT SEGUE TO MY

01:43:28.902 --> 01:43:30.938
OBVIOUS QUESTION WHICH IS IF YOU

01:43:31.004 --> 01:43:34.274
BACK FAILED. THE SALES TAX- THE

01:43:34.341 --> 01:43:35.275
DID THE DEAL DIESEL SALES TAX

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:36.910
SUSPENSION AND THE FACT THAT

01:43:36.977 --> 01:43:38.445
GASOLINE ALSO NEEDS TO BE THE

01:43:38.512 --> 01:43:39.413
PRICE REDUCTION BECAUSE YOUR

01:43:39.479 --> 01:43:41.248
KNOWLEDGE THEY'RE GOING UP WHY

01:43:41.315 --> 01:43:43.850
NOT BACK FILL INS IS THE PLACE

01:43:43.917 --> 01:43:48.488
TO SPEND THE GAS TAX. THE

01:43:48.555 --> 01:43:51.959
STATE'S GAS TAX- RIGHT NOW WE

01:43:52.025 --> 01:43:54.227
RETRACTED- ON OUR DOUBTS

01:43:54.294 --> 01:43:56.630
PROPOSAL TO A GAS TAX REBATE

01:43:56.697 --> 01:43:59.800
THAT'S INTENDED TO. PROVIDE THE

01:43:59.866 --> 01:44:03.403
RELIEF FOR. CALIFORNIA DRIVERS

01:44:03.470 --> 01:44:04.371
MAKING DOUBTS ABOUT OUR AND MORE

01:44:04.438 --> 01:44:07.274
TARGETED WAY I'M- PROVIDING THAT

01:44:07.341 --> 01:44:09.643
REALLY WITHOUT- CRICKETING

01:44:09.710 --> 01:44:11.378
COMPLICATED BUDGET MECHANISMS

01:44:11.445 --> 01:44:14.548
AFTER THE FACT- OKAY YOU SEE THE

01:44:14.615 --> 01:44:16.783
IRONY THAT YOU BACK FILLED THE

01:44:16.850 --> 01:44:19.519
SUSPENSION OF THE DIESEL SALES

01:44:19.586 --> 01:44:21.488
TAX BECAUSE YOU'RE CONCERNED

01:44:21.555 --> 01:44:23.657
ABOUT THE PRICE OF DIESEL BOND

01:44:23.724 --> 01:44:25.692
PRODUCTS INFLATION BUT THEN YOU

01:44:25.759 --> 01:44:27.728
DON'T USE THE SAME LOGIC FOR

01:44:27.794 --> 01:44:29.730
GASOLINE WHICH MORE PEOPLE

01:44:29.796 --> 01:44:31.765
ACTUALLY USE- TO THE STATE. AND

01:44:31.832 --> 01:44:33.700
THE L. L. ACTUALLY SAYS THAT

01:44:33.767 --> 01:44:34.835
REDUCING THE FUEL TAXES WILL

01:44:34.901 --> 01:44:37.104
MOST DIRECTLY TARGET- THOSE

01:44:37.170 --> 01:44:38.805
AFFECTED BY HIGH GAS PRICES

01:44:38.872 --> 01:44:39.740
BECAUSE IT'S LINKED TO THE

01:44:39.806 --> 01:44:42.643
AMOUNT OF CONSUMPTION SO I KNOW

01:44:42.709 --> 01:44:43.744
THAT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION BUT

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.846
I JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THAT

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:47.848
