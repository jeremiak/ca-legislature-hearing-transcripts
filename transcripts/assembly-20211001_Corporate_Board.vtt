TALKED ABOUT THE GLASS CEILING

00:37:43.427 --> 00:37:45.129
FOR ASIAN PACIFIC ISLANDERS-

00:37:45.196 --> 00:37:46.597

00:37:46.664 --> 00:37:47.865
WE EXAMINED MANY DIFFERENT

00:37:47.932 --> 00:37:51.469
FIELDS AT WHERE. BASICALLY YOU

00:37:51.535 --> 00:37:55.272
SAW. API TO- CERTAIN

00:37:55.339 --> 00:37:57.475

PERHAPS WERE WELL REPRESENTED

00:38:02.279 --> 00:38:03.614
IN CERTAIN FIELDS LIKE

MANAGEMENT POSITIONS C. SUITES

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:17.628
AND BOARDS. AND I THINK THAT

00:38:17.695 --> 00:38:19.296
THE REASON I BRING THIS UP IS

00:38:19.363 --> 00:38:21.832
THAT- YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO'S

00:38:21.899 --> 00:38:23.901

AND CERTAINLY I'M NOT SAYING

00:38:34.011 --> 00:38:34.979
THAT THERE AREN'T CERTAIN

00:38:35.046 --> 00:38:36.714

FOR MANY COMMUNITIES OF COLOR

00:38:37.381 --> 00:38:39.617
WHERE THERE ARE. THERE ARE NOT

00:38:39.684 --> 00:38:40.584
ENOUGH OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:38:40.651 --> 00:38:42.086
ADVANCEMENT OF STRUCTURAL

00:38:42.153 --> 00:38:44.622
RACISM HAS PREVENTED- PEOPLE OF

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:46.023
COLOR FROM BEING ABLE TO EVEN

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:47.825
GET ON TO THE ENTRY RONNING'S

00:38:47.892 --> 00:38:50.161

THE API COMMITTEE WHERE FOR

00:38:52.596 --> 00:38:53.964

PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO ASCEND INTO.

00:38:59.870 --> 00:39:02.106
SOME OF THOSE YOU KNOW A

00:39:02.173 --> 00:39:03.074
PROFESSIONAL POSITION AND SO

00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:05.976
FORTH. THAT THE PIPELINE IS NOT

00:39:06.043 --> 00:39:09.447
THE ISSUE. AND THAT'S AN EXCUSE.

00:39:09.513 --> 00:39:12.116
THE PIPELINE IS THERE SO WHY IS

00:39:12.183 --> 00:39:14.085
IT IN MY OWN FIELD OF MEDICINE

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:16.353
THAT WELL WHAT IS THAT WHILE

00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:19.123
YOU SEE REPRESENTATION AT LEAST

00:39:19.190 --> 00:39:19.724
FOR CERTAIN SUBSEGMENTS AMONG

THE FACULTY. WE LOOK AMONG

00:39:22.293 --> 00:39:25.062
MEDICAL SCHOOL DEANS. THE I

00:39:25.129 --> 00:39:26.697
THINK WE'VE ACTUALLY FOUND ONE.

00:39:26.764 --> 00:39:28.666
RIGHT A LOT OF CREDIT MEDICAL

00:39:28.733 --> 00:39:30.701
SCHOOLS IN UNITED STATES. RIGHT

00:39:30.768 --> 00:39:31.669
AND THEN LET'S TALK ABOUT

00:39:31.736 --> 00:39:33.738
CORPORATE BOARDS AGAIN IN FACT

00:39:33.804 --> 00:39:35.706
IF YOU TAKE TECHNOLOGY WHERE

00:39:35.773 --> 00:39:37.708
SUPPOSEDLY AGAIN ONLY CERTAIN

00:39:37.775 --> 00:39:38.843

00:39:38.909 --> 00:39:40.644
COMMITTEE ARE WELL REPRESENTED.

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.747
IN THE TECH FIELD YOU DON'T SEE

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:45.750
THEM IN THE C. SUITES AND THE

00:39:45.816 --> 00:39:47.918
BARS AND IN FACT. IT IS AND IF

00:39:47.985 --> 00:39:49.587
YOU TAKE OUT THE ONES WHO

00:39:49.653 --> 00:39:50.721
ACTUALLY FOUNDED THE COMPANIES

00:39:50.788 --> 00:39:52.490

THE FOUNDERS OF THE COMPANIES.

00:39:55.459 --> 00:39:58.929
THEN THE NUMBERS EVEN WORSE. SO

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:00.097
IT'S NOT BECAUSE OF LACK OF

00:40:00.164 --> 00:40:02.433
TALENT AND I KNOW OUR COMMUNITY

00:40:02.500 --> 00:40:02.967
STRUGGLES WITH THE MODEL

00:40:03.033 --> 00:40:04.935
MINORITY MYTH. IT'S NOT LACK OF

00:40:05.002 --> 00:40:07.872
TALENT IT'S NOT LACK OF

DEGREE THAT THOSE OPPORTUNITIES

AFFORDED OUR COMMUNITIES. IT'S

00:40:13.410 --> 00:40:16.914
FRANKLY RACISM. AND SO WE NEED

ONLY HAVE AND SUPPORT A DIVERSE

01:08:54.730 --> 01:08:56.665

FUTURE OF DIVERSE LEADERS

01:09:00.669 --> 01:09:01.837
THROUGH THE DIVERSITY OF THE

EMPLOYEE WORK FORCE AND

01:09:03.572 --> 01:09:05.508
PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT LEADERSHIP

01:09:05.574 --> 01:09:08.010

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:11.146
THE NEXT SLIDE. UP ESTHER HAVE

01:09:11.213 --> 01:09:13.616
PROVIDED A GREAT UPDATE ON THE

01:09:13.682 --> 01:09:15.885
IMPACT TO THE NUMBER OF WOMEN

01:09:15.951 --> 01:09:18.087
ON CALIFORNIA BOARDS- THAT ARE

01:09:18.153 --> 01:09:19.455
HEADQUARTERED HERE IN THE STATE

01:09:19.522 --> 01:09:20.723
OF CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS THE

01:09:20.789 --> 01:09:22.691
NUMBER OF PORTS SEATS HELD BY.

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:24.527
OTHER UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS

01:09:24.593 --> 01:09:25.461
I'M NOT GOING TO GO THROUGH THE

01:09:25.528 --> 01:09:28.664
NUMBERS- AND NO SHE POINTED OUT

01:09:28.731 --> 01:09:31.500
HOW LOW THE LATINO- OF.

01:09:31.567 --> 01:09:33.402
REPRESENTATION IS ON BOARDS

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:36.539
AGAIN ASIANS ARE ALSO DOWN AT

01:09:36.605 --> 01:09:38.841
THE AT THE LOW PERCENTAGES OF

01:09:38.908 --> 01:09:41.844
THAT GROUP AS WELL. SO IN STATE

01:09:41.911 --> 01:09:43.746
OF FOCUSING MORE ON THE NUMBERS

01:09:43.812 --> 01:09:45.814
I WANTED TO SHARE SOME THOUGHTS

01:09:45.881 --> 01:09:48.884
ON HOW. WE AND THE LEGISLATURE

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.786
COULD FURTHER IMPROVE ON THE

01:09:50.853 --> 01:09:52.588

01:20:38.700 --> 01:20:41.203
COMBINING DIVERSITY DATA OR

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.818
WOMEN SOMETIMES WILL GIVE

01:20:56.885 --> 01:20:58.320
HERE'S HOW WOMEN ARE DOING BUT

01:20:58.386 --> 01:21:00.555
WE ALSO NEED TO DISAGGREGATE.

01:21:00.622 --> 01:21:03.658
ARM THE NUMBER OF WOMEN AS WELL

01:21:03.725 --> 01:21:04.859

FOR ALL. AND HOW WE'RE DOING

01:21:11.399 --> 01:21:13.101
FOR WOMEN OF COLOR THOSE ARE A

01:21:13.168 --> 01:21:14.836
COUPLE OF RECOMMENDATIONS BUT I

01:21:14.903 --> 01:21:16.705
COMPLETELY AGREE AND- CONCUR

01:21:16.771 --> 01:21:20.809

DEMOGRAPHIC. CALIFORNIA IS

01:23:34.376 --> 01:23:36.945
DISTINCT IN THAT WAY- IF YOU

01:23:37.011 --> 01:23:38.546
LOOK AT THE OVERALL CALIFORNIA

01:23:38.613 --> 01:23:40.949
STATISTICS LATINOS HOLD TWO

01:23:41.015 --> 01:23:43.318

01:24:00.769 --> 01:24:02.837
NATIONWIDE IT SHOULD BE CLOSER

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.607
TO FOUR PERCENT- BUT WE DO HAVE

BECAUSE IT'S RAINING- IN THE

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:25.353

COMPLETELY WE WERE TRENDING

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:51.212
THERE I THINK THERE COULD BE A

01:30:51.279 --> 01:30:55.316
LOT MORE. MORE INCLUSION. CHECK

01:30:55.383 --> 01:30:57.785

SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX ISSUES

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:01.622
GIVEN OUR TECHNOLOGY GIVEN

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:03.691

ALMOST. YEAH GOING TO PROVIDE A

01:31:09.697 --> 01:31:10.765
GREAT DEAL OF VALUE IN THE

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:13.134
BOARDROOM. COMPARED TO SOMEONE

01:31:13.201 --> 01:31:14.735
WHO IS IN A C. OR FORTY YEARS

01:31:14.802 --> 01:31:16.270
AGO I'M JUST GIVING AN EXAMPLE

01:31:16.337 --> 01:31:17.905
OF COURSE AND IT WOULD BE

01:31:17.972 --> 01:31:20.908
VALUABLE TO BUT THERE IS- SOME

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:24.011
TRAINED TO LOOK AT OTHER- SKILL

01:31:24.078 --> 01:31:27.715
SETS ARE WE'VE BEEN ON IN SOME.

01:31:27.782 --> 01:31:29.917
THE DATABASE IS NATIONWIDE

01:31:29.984 --> 01:31:32.253
WE'RE SEEING- AN INCREASE OF

01:31:32.320 --> 01:31:33.988
LATINO APPOINTMENTS IN OTHER

01:31:34.055 --> 01:31:36.157
YOU LOOK AT ALL THE STATES. AND

01:31:36.224 --> 01:31:38.326
OF THE NEW APPOINTMENTS THIS IS

01:31:38.392 --> 01:31:40.027
IN THE LAST SIX MONTHS OR TWO

01:31:40.094 --> 01:31:43.965
HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FOUR- 40%

01:31:44.031 --> 01:31:45.166
OF THE APPOINTMENTS FOR LETTING

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:47.268
US. WHICH IS HIGHER THAN IT'S

01:31:47.335 --> 01:31:50.371
TRENDING HIGHER AND 43% OR

01:31:50.438 --> 01:31:52.840
FIRST TIME DIRECTORS SO THERE'S

01:31:52.907 --> 01:31:54.675
SOME. PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED THAT

01:31:54.742 --> 01:31:56.277

01:31:58.112 --> 01:31:59.914
ANOTHER ANOTHER. WE ARE SEEING

01:31:59.981 --> 01:32:02.984
A TREND IDENTIFYING FIRST TIME

01:32:03.050 --> 01:32:07.455
DIRECTORS. IN TERMS OF OVERALL

01:32:07.521 --> 01:32:09.724
TURNOVER EXCEEDS. THERE IS NOT

01:32:09.790 --> 01:32:11.592
SOME REPORTS LIKE HEIDRICK AND

01:32:11.659 --> 01:32:13.227
STRUGGLES MEASURES MEASURES IS

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:14.695
THAT THEIR SEARCH FOR ALL AND

01:32:14.762 --> 01:32:16.797
OTHER SEARCH FORUMS MEASURE.

01:32:16.864 --> 01:32:18.766
YOU KNOW HOW MANY APPOINTMENTS

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:21.469
OPENED UP AND TURNED OVER IN A

01:32:21.535 --> 01:32:23.938
SINGLE YEAR AND THE AND THEY

01:32:24.005 --> 01:32:26.173
BALK AT THE FORTUNE FIVE

01:32:26.240 --> 01:32:28.142
HUNDRED OF THE FORTUNE FIVE

OF SEATS REPRESENTED BUT I

01:32:42.223 --> 01:32:44.058

01:32:44.125 --> 01:32:45.893
OF THOSE REPORTS WOULD GIVE YOU

01:32:45.960 --> 01:32:48.029

SEATS TURN OVER. IN FACT I

01:32:50.331 --> 01:32:52.600
THINK IT'S VERY MUCH ACTUALLY

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:53.100
THIS ONE DID YOU WANT TO

01:32:53.167 --> 01:32:54.402

03:02:00.776 --> 03:02:02.211
SINCE THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES

03:02:02.278 --> 03:02:03.912
THE COURT HAS UPHELD THE USE OF

DIVERSE WORK. THE MAKE UP OF

03:02:26.068 --> 03:02:27.336
THE HIGH COURT IS DRASTICALLY

03:02:27.403 --> 03:02:27.903
DIFFERENT THAN EVEN A DECADE

03:02:27.970 --> 03:02:31.273

AFFIRMATIVE ACTION WE JUST

03:04:44.273 --> 03:04:46.275
COMES AT THE TAIL END TO FORCE

03:04:46.341 --> 03:04:47.342
A CHOICE BASED ON RACE OR

03:04:47.409 --> 03:04:49.378
