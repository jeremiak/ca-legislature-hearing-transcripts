WE'RE NOT USUALLY THIS ORGANIZED

FUNDS PROVIDED FOR THE COMMUNITY

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:46.145
COLLEGES WOULD BE OBLIGATED.

00:05:46.212 --> 00:05:47.080
CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:05:47.146 --> 00:05:48.648
ADMINISTRATION'S CRITERIA FOR

00:05:48.715 --> 00:05:49.949
CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING FOR A

00:05:50.016 --> 00:05:51.751
STATEWIDE THE PROJECT

00:05:51.818 --> 00:05:53.119
RECOMMENDED FOR FUNDING ADDRESS

00:05:53.186 --> 00:05:54.987
CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE FIRE

00:05:55.054 --> 00:05:56.289
LIFE SAFETY ISSUES.

00:05:56.355 --> 00:05:57.356
WELL FIRE LIFE SAFETY ISSUES

00:05:57.423 --> 00:05:58.624
AREN'T NECESSARILY THE SOLE

00:05:58.691 --> 00:06:00.393
REASON FOR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.394
PROJECT TO BE CONSIDERED FOR

00:06:01.461 --> 00:06:02.862
FUNDING IT SHOULD BE A

00:06:02.929 --> 00:06:04.263
SIGNIFICANT DRIVER.

00:06:04.330 --> 00:06:05.698
WHEN DETERMINING WHICH PROJECTS

00:06:05.765 --> 00:06:07.266
TO BE FUNDED THE ADMINISTRATION

00:06:07.333 --> 00:06:08.801
CONSIDERS WHETHER A REQUESTING

00:06:08.868 --> 00:06:10.503
DISTRICT CAN PROVIDE SOME LEVEL

00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:11.904
OF FUNDING MATCH OR IF THERE ARE

00:06:11.971 --> 00:06:13.473
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

00:06:13.539 --> 00:06:14.707
PREVENTED DISTRICT FROM

00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:15.708
CONTRIBUTING?

00:06:15.775 --> 00:06:16.676
AN EXAMPLE OF THE LATTER WOULD

00:06:16.743 --> 00:06:17.944
INCLUDE REDWOOD COMMUNITY

00:06:18.010 --> 00:06:19.345
COLLEGE DISTRICT A SMALL

00:06:19.412 --> 00:06:20.246
DISTRICT WAS SIGNIFICANT

00:06:20.313 --> 00:06:23.082
INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS RESULTING

00:06:23.149 --> 00:06:24.617
FROM RECENT SEISMIC ANALYSES --

00:06:24.684 --> 00:06:25.618
WE NOTE THAT CONCERNS HAVE BEEN

00:06:25.685 --> 00:06:26.619
RAISED ABOUT THE

00:06:26.686 --> 00:06:27.787
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSED

00:06:27.854 --> 00:06:29.122
APPROACH AND THAT IT WOULD

00:06:29.188 --> 00:06:30.690
CREATE -- I BELIEVE THAT --

00:06:30.757 --> 00:06:32.925
CREATE A DISINCENTIVE FOR

00:06:32.992 --> 00:06:33.626
DISTRICTS TO MAINTAIN THE

00:06:33.693 --> 00:06:36.062
FACILITY -- HOWEVER WE DISAGREE

00:06:36.129 --> 00:06:38.297
THAT -- COLLEGES WOULD PURPOSELY

00:06:38.364 --> 00:06:39.198
ALLOW THEIR BUILDINGS TO FALL

00:06:39.265 --> 00:06:41.167
INTO DISREPAIR IN ORDER TO

00:06:41.234 --> 00:06:42.535
ACCESS THE REMAINING ONE POINT

00:06:42.602 --> 00:06:44.971
THREE BILLION AND ON OBLIGATED

00:06:45.037 --> 00:06:49.542
PROP FIFTY ONE FONT -- WE WOULD

00:06:49.609 --> 00:06:50.910
ALSO NOTE THAT -- FOR PART OF

00:06:50.977 --> 00:06:51.444
THE REASON IS BECAUSE THE

00:06:51.511 --> 00:06:52.645
COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALREADY KNOW

00:06:52.712 --> 00:06:54.380
IT'S A SIXTEEN POINT SIX BILLION

00:06:54.447 --> 00:06:55.448
DOLLAR.

00:06:55.515 --> 00:06:56.783
NEED IN STATE FUNDS ARE SO AS

00:06:56.849 --> 00:07:01.154
WELL IN EXCESS OF WHAT REMAINS.

00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:02.321
WELL I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT I

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:04.090
THINK I'LL WAIT TO EVERYBODY

00:07:04.157 --> 00:07:08.661
ELSE THE PRESENTS -- ROLE WITH

00:07:08.728 --> 00:07:10.496
THE LA -- SO WE HAVE TO TO

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:11.697
GENERAL -- COMMENTS ON UNRELATED

00:07:11.764 --> 00:07:12.932
TO COMMIT CALLED FACILITIES.

00:07:12.999 --> 00:07:15.301
FIRST IT'S MORE OF A HIGH LEVEL --

00:07:15.368 --> 00:07:16.402
SHOULD TERMS OF THE TOTAL NUMBER

00:07:16.469 --> 00:07:17.870
OF PROJECTS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN

00:07:17.937 --> 00:07:19.138
THIS BUDGET.

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.339
I'M AS WE NOTED IN OUR ANALYSIS

00:07:20.406 --> 00:07:21.941
THERE -- THIS ADMINISTRATION OF

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:22.775
THE PROOF SUBSTANTIALLY MORE

00:07:22.842 --> 00:07:24.343
PROJECTS THAN THE PREVIOUS

00:07:24.410 --> 00:07:25.745
ADMINISTRATION HAD INCLUDED.

00:07:25.812 --> 00:07:27.213
WE THINK THIS IS A STEP IN THE

00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.748
RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK WE HAVE --

00:07:28.815 --> 00:07:29.615
CONCERNS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS

00:07:29.682 --> 00:07:31.450
THAT -- THERE WERE NOT VERY MANY

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:32.985
PROJECTS APPROVED IN THE BUDGET

00:07:33.052 --> 00:07:33.886
AND THAT THAT MEANS WE WOULD BE

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:36.189
A VERY SLOW PACE TO EXHAUST THE

00:07:36.255 --> 00:07:37.723
TWO BILLION DOLLARS FROM PROP.

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.591
FIFTY ONE I'M EVEN NOW WITH

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:40.259
THESE ADDITIONAL -- PROJECTS

00:07:40.326 --> 00:07:41.360
APPROVED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:07:41.427 --> 00:07:43.062
BUDGET WERE STOLEN PACE FOR

00:07:43.129 --> 00:07:45.264
ABOUT EIGHT OR NINE YEARS UNTIL --

00:07:45.331 --> 00:07:46.933
PROP FIFTY ONE FUNDING WOULD BE

00:07:46.999 --> 00:07:48.334
COMPLETELY EXHAUSTED.

00:07:48.401 --> 00:07:48.935
AND WE THINK THAT THE

00:07:49.001 --> 00:07:50.336
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER --

00:07:50.403 --> 00:07:51.537
APPROVING EVEN MORE PROJECTS IN

00:07:51.604 --> 00:07:53.472
THE IN THE BUDGET CONSIDERING

00:07:53.539 --> 00:07:55.842
THAT THE THE REASON WHY --

00:07:55.908 --> 00:07:56.475
PROPERTY ONE FUNDS HAVE BEEN SO

00:07:56.542 --> 00:07:57.810
SLOW IN GETTING ROLLED OUT IS

00:07:57.877 --> 00:07:59.445
NOT BECAUSE OF THE MAN FROM THE

00:07:59.512 --> 00:08:00.980
COLLEGES AS YOU CAN SEE FROM

00:08:01.047 --> 00:08:02.248
YOUR AGENDA.

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:03.149
ON PAGE TWENTY SEVEN IS A AN

00:08:03.216 --> 00:08:04.517
ENTIRE PAGE OF PROJECTS THAT

00:08:04.584 --> 00:08:05.351
HAVE BEEN APPROVED BY THE

00:08:05.418 --> 00:08:06.819
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT WERE

00:08:06.886 --> 00:08:08.221
NOT INCLUDED IN THE BUDGET.

00:08:08.287 --> 00:08:09.488
I'M SO WE DO THINK THAT YOU ARE

00:08:09.555 --> 00:08:10.556
YOU MIGHT ANT TO CONSIDER

00:08:10.623 --> 00:08:13.426
ADDING ADDITIONAL -- OFF OF THE

00:08:13.492 --> 00:08:19.732
ONE BOND SPENDING TO TO FIND

00:08:19.799 --> 00:08:21.901
MORE PROJECTS.

00:08:21.968 --> 00:08:24.203
AND THE THE SECOND ISSUE IS --

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:25.271
MR GOVERNMENTS IN LITTLE BIT AS

00:08:25.338 --> 00:08:25.905
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE

00:08:25.972 --> 00:08:27.473
THE WAY THAT FINANCE IS LOOKING

00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:29.175
AT THESE -- LEASING LACKED THE

00:08:29.242 --> 00:08:30.243
LIFE SAFETY CRITERIA AS A FILTER

00:08:30.309 --> 00:08:30.877
FOR DECIDING WHICH PROJECTS TO

00:08:30.943 --> 00:08:33.613
INCLUDE -- WE ARE CONCERNED THAT --

00:08:33.679 --> 00:08:34.747
THE THE FIFTH MEANS THAT THERE

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:36.649
ARE SOME PROJECTS -- THAT ARE

00:08:36.716 --> 00:08:38.517
THAT IT THAT IT YOU KNOW YOU'RE

00:08:38.584 --> 00:08:39.452
APPROVING A PROJECT IN SOME

00:08:39.518 --> 00:08:41.287
DISTRICTS WHERE THEY DONE A POOR

00:08:41.354 --> 00:08:42.955
JOB OF MAINTAINING THE BUILDINGS --

00:08:43.022 --> 00:08:44.190
BUT THE THE CHANCES OF IT HAS A

00:08:44.257 --> 00:08:45.424
LONG ESTABLISHED APPROACH -- TO

00:08:45.491 --> 00:08:46.559
PROVING PROJECT AND THEY HAVE A

00:08:46.626 --> 00:08:48.027
LIFE FIFTY CATEGORY SPECIFICALLY

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:49.595
TO HAVE SOME SPECIFIC RULES.

00:08:49.662 --> 00:08:51.297
AND THEN THEY HAVE SEVERAL OTHER

00:08:51.364 --> 00:08:52.098
CATEGORIES THAT ARE NOT ABOUT

00:08:52.164 --> 00:08:53.633
LIFE EITHER ABOUT INCREASING

00:08:53.699 --> 00:08:55.301
INSTRUCTIONAL CAPACITY AND

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:58.170
MODERNIZING FACILITIES -- WE

00:08:58.237 --> 00:08:59.672
DON'T THINK THAT WITH THOSE

00:08:59.739 --> 00:09:00.840
THOSE CATEGORIES THERE NEEDS TO

00:09:00.907 --> 00:09:01.807
BE THERE ADDITIONAL LIFE FIFTY

00:09:01.874 --> 00:09:02.909
LINES AND THE WAY THAT THE THE

00:09:02.975 --> 00:09:04.644
THIS APPROACH PLAYS OUT IS THAT

00:09:04.710 --> 00:09:08.381
YOU MIGHT HAVE. FOR EXAMPLE --

00:09:08.447 --> 00:09:09.448
TO TO DISTRICTS WHERE

00:09:09.515 --> 00:09:10.650
APPLICATIONS TO HAVE A THIRTY

00:09:10.716 --> 00:09:12.151
YEAR OLD BUILDINGS MODERNIZED.

00:09:12.218 --> 00:09:13.052
AND EVERYONE DISTRICT HAS DONE A

00:09:13.119 --> 00:09:15.121
GOOD JOB OF MAINTAINING THEIR

00:09:15.187 --> 00:09:16.389
BUILDING SO THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

00:09:16.455 --> 00:09:17.356
ANY LIKE SAFETY ISSUES.

00:09:17.423 --> 00:09:19.659
THEY ARE WOULD BE WOULD GET LEFT

00:09:19.725 --> 00:09:21.694
PRIOR EVEN A DISTRICT WHO'S

00:09:21.761 --> 00:09:23.129
THIRTY YEAR OLD BUILDING IS IN

00:09:23.195 --> 00:09:25.331
PAIN -- DISREPAIR I'M SO WE HAVE

00:09:25.398 --> 00:09:27.300
CONCERNS ABOUT SENDING THE WRONG

00:09:27.366 --> 00:09:27.934
SIGNALS TOOK TO COMPLETE COLLEGE

00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.936
OF AND SO WE WE WOULD RECOMMEND --

00:09:30.002 --> 00:09:30.870

OUR MOST RECENT FIVE YEAR PLAN

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:54.453
ESTIMATES THE NEED OF THIRTY

00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.087
BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT

CURRENT PROGRAM TO MEET.

00:11:05.164 --> 00:11:05.831
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:11:05.898 --> 00:11:06.665
THAT.

00:11:06.732 --> 00:11:08.667
MOST CAPITAL OUTLAY FUNDING

INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING IN THE

00:11:09.969 --> 00:11:12.371
SYSTEM IS LOCAL FUNDING SO WE

00:11:12.438 --> 00:11:14.607
ARE BUILDING ON LOCAL FUNDING --

00:11:14.673 --> 00:11:16.142
WITH THE STATE BOND PROGRAM

00:11:16.208 --> 00:11:17.576
THROUGH PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE

00:11:17.643 --> 00:11:18.811
DISTRICTS ALSO GENERATE

00:11:18.878 --> 00:11:19.979
SIGNIFICANT FUNDING FROM OTHER

00:11:20.046 --> 00:11:22.515

CAN'T MEET THAT THIRTY BILLION

00:11:30.089 --> 00:11:31.524
DOLLAR DEMAND TODAY AND SO WE GO

00:11:31.590 --> 00:11:33.259
THROUGH A PROCESS OF THE SYSTEM

00:11:33.325 --> 00:11:36.228

FUTURE ACTIONS RELATED TO

00:13:44.156 --> 00:13:45.891
CAPITAL OUTLAY -- THEY WERE

00:13:45.958 --> 00:13:47.726
NOTED IN YOUR AGENDA -- WE ARE

00:13:47.793 --> 00:13:49.895
WORKING TO SEE HOW OR

00:13:49.962 --> 00:13:52.364
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS I CAN

00:13:52.431 --> 00:13:54.633
FURTHER THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

00:13:54.700 --> 00:13:56.569
IN THERE TO REALLY -- ISSUES

00:13:56.635 --> 00:13:58.137
THAT WE ARE MOST INTERESTED IN

00:13:58.204 --> 00:13:58.938
THINKING ABOUT HOW

00:13:59.004 --> 00:14:00.372
INFRASTRUCTURE MIGHT BE BETTER

00:14:00.439 --> 00:14:02.241
INTEGRATED TO SUPPORT

00:14:02.308 --> 00:14:04.176
COMPREHENSIVE GUIDED PATHWAYS --

00:14:04.243 --> 00:14:05.678
WHETHER THIS DISTINCTION BETWEEN

00:14:05.744 --> 00:14:07.446
INSTRUCTIONAL SPACE AND SUPPORT

00:14:07.513 --> 00:14:08.814
SPACE CONTINUES TO MAKE SENSE.

00:14:08.881 --> 00:14:09.915
AND THEN WHETHER IN OUR

00:14:09.982 --> 00:14:11.217
PRIORITIZATION OF PROJECTS WE

00:14:11.283 --> 00:14:12.751
SHOULD BE CONSIDERING THE EQUITY

00:14:12.818 --> 00:14:14.353
GAPS THAT WE SEE ACROSS REGIONS

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:15.821
ACROSS GROUPS OF STUDENTS.

00:14:15.888 --> 00:14:17.156
THE VISION FOR SUCCESS

00:14:17.223 --> 00:14:19.291
IDENTIFIES REGIONS -- OF

00:14:19.358 --> 00:14:20.693
PARTICULARLY LOW PERFORMANCE THE

00:14:20.759 --> 00:14:22.361
EMINEM HIGHER THE CENTRAL VALLEY

00:14:22.428 --> 00:14:24.830
THE FAR NORTH AND WE ARE LOOKING

00:14:24.897 --> 00:14:26.699
AT WAYS IN WHICH WE MIGHT THINK

00:14:26.765 --> 00:14:28.067
ABOUT HOW THOSE GAPS.

00:14:28.133 --> 00:14:30.202
ARE AFFECTED BY THE ACCESS TO

00:14:30.269 --> 00:14:31.704
QUALITY FACILITIES THESE

00:14:31.770 --> 00:14:33.606
DISCUSSIONS ARE VERY PRELIMINARY

00:14:33.672 --> 00:14:35.040
AND WE WILL SEE -- WE WILL BE

00:14:35.107 --> 00:14:36.809
SEEKING CONSULTATION TO OUR

00:14:36.875 --> 00:14:39.979
FORMAL INTERNAL STAKEHOLDERS

00:14:40.045 --> 00:14:41.714
CONSTANT CONSULTATION PROCESS.

00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:42.815
HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS.

00:14:42.881 --> 00:14:45.251
WELL LET ME START BY ASKING THIS

00:14:45.317 --> 00:14:47.186
QUESTION WHY DON'T WE BEFORE I

00:14:47.253 --> 00:14:49.221
GET INTO HOW THIS FACILITY

00:14:49.288 --> 00:14:50.456
ALLOCATION.

00:14:50.522 --> 00:14:52.358
FUND MONEY ALLOCATION PROCESS

00:14:52.424 --> 00:14:54.493
WORKS WORKS WHICH I COULD

00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:56.128
CONFESSES CONFUSING TO ME.

00:14:56.195 --> 00:14:58.530
WHY DON'T WE JUST ISSUE THE REST

00:14:58.597 --> 00:15:00.566
OF THE BONDS?

00:15:00.633 --> 00:15:03.802
SO THE REST OF THE BONDS AND

00:15:03.869 --> 00:15:05.237
HAVE A PRIORITY LIST IN.

00:15:05.304 --> 00:15:07.006
APPROPRIATE PRIORITY LIST WILL

00:15:07.072 --> 00:15:09.575
GET TO THAT AND START AT THE TOP.

00:15:09.642 --> 00:15:11.243
AND THEN FIX WHAT WE CAN AND

00:15:11.310 --> 00:15:12.845
THEN.

00:15:12.911 --> 00:15:13.712
FIGURE OUT WHAT THE NEXT STEP IS

00:15:13.779 --> 00:15:19.585
GOING TO BE.

00:15:19.652 --> 00:15:21.754
AND I'M NOT BEING CRITICAL -- I

00:15:21.820 --> 00:15:23.422
APPRECIATE EVERYTHING THAT

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:25.190
ADMINISTRATION IS DOING.

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:26.091
TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

00:15:26.158 --> 00:15:27.192
FLOWING THROUGH THE PIPELINE TO

00:15:27.259 --> 00:15:29.128
GET SOME OF THESE BUILDINGS AND

00:15:29.194 --> 00:15:30.629
PROJECTS.

00:15:30.696 --> 00:15:31.630
BUILDING FIXED IN PROJECTS --

00:15:31.697 --> 00:15:35.000
GOING SO BUT I AM CURIOUS AS TO

00:15:35.067 --> 00:15:36.902
IT'S A RELATIVELY.

00:15:36.969 --> 00:15:38.671
SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY GIVEN THE

00:15:38.737 --> 00:15:41.740
MONEY WE DEAL WITH HERE.

00:15:41.807 --> 00:15:44.476
YEAH -- I'LL BE HAPPY TO TAKE A

00:15:44.543 --> 00:15:46.912
OR AT LEAST TAKE THE FIRST STEP --

00:15:46.979 --> 00:15:49.114
ANSWERING THIS AND CAN GUIDE ME

00:15:49.181 --> 00:15:52.151
IF I'M GOING A BIT OFF COURSE

00:15:52.217 --> 00:15:53.886
YOU KNOW YOU HAD ME [inaudible]

00:15:53.952 --> 00:15:56.655
BUT THE BOND IT MEASURE ITSELF

00:15:56.722 --> 00:15:57.623
REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A

00:15:57.690 --> 00:15:58.824
LEGISLATIVE APPROPRIATION AND

00:15:58.891 --> 00:16:00.159
SOUNDS LIKE YOUR QUESTION IS WHY

00:16:00.225 --> 00:16:02.027
NOT JUST ONE LET JUST LET ONE

00:16:02.094 --> 00:16:03.996
APPROPRIATION. TWO BILLION OR

00:16:04.063 --> 00:16:06.065
STAY THE REMAINING ONE POINT SIX

00:16:06.131 --> 00:16:07.099
BILLION.

00:16:07.166 --> 00:16:09.168
COMMITTEE COLLEGE PROJECTS.

00:16:09.234 --> 00:16:11.637
AND I THINK -- PART OF THE

00:16:11.704 --> 00:16:12.805
CONCERN FROM THE MINISTRATIONS

00:16:12.871 --> 00:16:14.206
SIDE WOULD BE JUST KIND OF THE

00:16:14.273 --> 00:16:15.507
LEVEL OF REVIEW TO MAKE SURE

00:16:15.574 --> 00:16:17.476
IT'S THE HIGHEST QUALIFYING

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:19.611
PROJECTS BUT THAT'S PRETTY MUCH

00:16:19.678 --> 00:16:21.080
RESTATING SOME OF THE THINGS

00:16:21.146 --> 00:16:22.314
THAT CONCERNS THAT WE'VE HAD

00:16:22.381 --> 00:16:23.382
OVER TIME.

00:16:23.449 --> 00:16:27.486
ON THE OTHER ONE IS A BIT MORE --

00:16:27.553 --> 00:16:29.054
MAYBE A BIT MORE INTO THE WEEDS

00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:30.856
BUT IT'S THE NATURE OF HOW WE

00:16:30.923 --> 00:16:33.959
SELL THE BONDS THAT IS THE

00:16:34.026 --> 00:16:36.028
TYPICAL PRACTICE IN CAPITAL

00:16:36.095 --> 00:16:38.230
OUTLAY WEATHER'S BOND FUNDED OR

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:39.398
OR CAST FUNDED.

00:16:39.465 --> 00:16:40.632
THAT YOU ONLY PROVIDE THE

00:16:40.699 --> 00:16:42.401
AUTHORITY FOR THE PHASES THAT

00:16:42.468 --> 00:16:45.170
ARE NEEDED SO FOR EXAMPLE

00:16:45.237 --> 00:16:47.339
THERE'S THERE'S FIVE CONTINUING

00:16:47.406 --> 00:16:49.775
PROJECTS THAT ARE NOT FUNDED.

00:16:49.842 --> 00:16:50.876
FOR FOUR OF THEM IT'S JUST

00:16:50.943 --> 00:16:52.511
BECAUSE THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT

00:16:52.578 --> 00:16:53.712
THEY'RE NOT READY THEY'RE NOT

00:16:53.779 --> 00:16:56.215
EXPECTED TO ADVANCE TO THE POINT.

00:16:56.281 --> 00:16:56.915
WHERE THEY WOULD NEED TO

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.384
CONSTRUCTION I SEE SO YOU NEED

00:16:58.450 --> 00:16:59.918
TO RETAIN ENOUGH FUNDS?

00:16:59.985 --> 00:17:01.353
BUTTER AVAILABLE FUNDS IN THE

00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:03.122
FUTURE TO COMPLETE PROJECTS THAT

00:17:03.188 --> 00:17:04.790
YOU'VE ALREADY STARTED.

00:17:04.857 --> 00:17:09.962
IF YOU SPEND IT ALL YOUR BOND

00:17:10.028 --> 00:17:11.230
FUNDS.

00:17:11.296 --> 00:17:12.164
ON THE PRELIMINARY WORK IN THE

00:17:12.231 --> 00:17:13.198
PARTIAL WORK ON THE PROJECT AND

00:17:13.265 --> 00:17:14.166
YOU HAVE A BUNCH OF UNFINISHED

00:17:14.233 --> 00:17:16.502
STUFF LAYING AROUND THE STATE IS

00:17:16.568 --> 00:17:16.702
THAT.

00:17:16.769 --> 00:17:17.269
THAT'S FINE WAY MCEACHERN'S

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.537
THAT'S WHAT WE'RE DOING OKAY I

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:21.507
GET THAT.

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:23.108
SO THEN LET ME TALK ABOUT.

00:17:23.175 --> 00:17:24.877
LET ME TALK ABOUT THIS RATHER OF

00:17:24.943 --> 00:17:28.180
CONFUSING TO ME PROCESS WHEREBY

00:17:28.247 --> 00:17:29.314
THE CALIFORNIA.

00:17:29.381 --> 00:17:31.450
COMMUNITY COLLEGE ANSWERS OFFICE

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:34.553
ORDERS PRIORITY IN TERMS OF OF

00:17:34.620 --> 00:17:35.554
HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OTHER

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.922
PROJECTS THAT NEED TO BE

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.057
ADDRESSED.

00:17:39.124 --> 00:17:40.426
AND THEN THE LIST GOES.

00:17:40.492 --> 00:17:41.960
TO THE FIRST FLOOR [inaudible]

00:17:42.027 --> 00:17:44.096
AND THEN.

00:17:44.163 --> 00:17:45.831
A NEW LIST POPS OUT AT LEAST

00:17:45.898 --> 00:17:48.634
THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING.

00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:50.102
SOMETIMES THE PROJECTS ARE

00:17:50.169 --> 00:17:51.670
REORDERED SOMETIMES THERE

00:17:51.737 --> 00:17:53.505
ADDITIONAL PROJECTS THERE OF NEW

00:17:53.572 --> 00:17:55.507
PROJECTS ARE ADDED IN ALL

00:17:55.574 --> 00:17:57.576
PROJECTS REMOVED [inaudible]

00:17:57.643 --> 00:18:02.314
I THINK -- IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT

00:18:02.381 --> 00:18:05.984
IS PROPOSED TO BE FUNDED FELL.

00:18:06.051 --> 00:18:07.319
I WOULD SAY THAT THE

00:18:07.386 --> 00:18:09.288
ADMINISTRATION'S LIST IS WOULD

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:11.690
BE A SUBSET OF THE COMMUNITY

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.759
COLLEGES THAT MISSION.

00:18:13.826 --> 00:18:14.626
OKAY SO.

00:18:14.693 --> 00:18:16.094
THEY GIVE YOU ONE THROUGH TWENTY

00:18:16.161 --> 00:18:18.330
AND YOU WHAT COMES AT THE END OF

00:18:18.397 --> 00:18:20.365
YOUR PIPE IS ONE THROUGH.

00:18:20.432 --> 00:18:21.333
TEN BUT IT MIGHT NOT BE THE

00:18:21.400 --> 00:18:22.968
FIRST TEN YOU SKIP AROUND IN THE

00:18:23.035 --> 00:18:24.703
LIST AND IT MIGHT BE THE NUBER

00:18:24.770 --> 00:18:25.838
ONE AND NUMBER THREE AND NUMBER

00:18:25.904 --> 00:18:27.172
SIX IN.

00:18:27.239 --> 00:18:29.341
NUMBER NINE AND NUMBER TEN

00:18:29.408 --> 00:18:30.609
WHATEVER THE NUMBERS ARE TO GET

00:18:30.676 --> 00:18:31.677
THE TEN PROJECTS IS THAT ABOUT

00:18:31.743 --> 00:18:34.813
RIGHT -- WE WOULD HAVE A WE

00:18:34.880 --> 00:18:37.049
WOULD HAVE A DIRECT.

00:18:37.115 --> 00:18:39.218
IT WOULDN'T BE QUITE AS SIMPLE

00:18:39.284 --> 00:18:40.452
AS A SAYING.

00:18:40.519 --> 00:18:42.154
OKAY COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE'RE

00:18:42.221 --> 00:18:43.722
JUST GOING TO IMPROVE THOSE THAT

00:18:43.789 --> 00:18:45.858
ARE PRIME NUMBERS -- AND AND

00:18:45.924 --> 00:18:47.493
SAID WE'LL LOOK AT EACH ONE

00:18:47.559 --> 00:18:48.760
INDIVIDUALLY BASED ON OUR

00:18:48.827 --> 00:18:50.262
CRITERIA.

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:53.799
AND SO IN THIS CASE OTHER.

00:18:53.866 --> 00:18:56.101
THIRTY NINE NEW REQUEST ABOUT

00:18:56.168 --> 00:18:57.469
FIFTEEN MET THE ADMINISTRATION'S

00:18:57.536 --> 00:18:58.871
CRITERIA ORDERS MIKE HERE'S MY

00:18:58.937 --> 00:19:02.941
CONCERN -- K. THROUGH TWELVE

00:19:03.008 --> 00:19:06.245
IZZY EQUALLY -- BOGGLING TO MIND

00:19:06.311 --> 00:19:07.312
BOGGLING TO ME BUT THIS IS

00:19:07.379 --> 00:19:09.481
PARTICULARLY SO BECAUSE I CAN'T

00:19:09.548 --> 00:19:11.016
FIGURE OUT WHEN.

00:19:11.083 --> 00:19:12.618
DISTRICTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:19:12.684 --> 00:19:14.052
DISTRICTS COME TO ME.

00:19:14.119 --> 00:19:15.954
NOT IN THIS CAPACITY BUT IN THE

00:19:16.021 --> 00:19:17.155
PAST.

00:19:17.222 --> 00:19:18.891
DISTRICTS THAT AREN'T EVEN IN MY

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.225
SENATE DISTRICT.

00:19:20.292 --> 00:19:21.426
AND ASK ME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE

00:19:21.493 --> 00:19:23.729
SELECTION CRITERIA AND HOW ONE

00:19:23.795 --> 00:19:25.197
DISTRICT MADE A LIST AND HOW THE

00:19:25.264 --> 00:19:27.165
OTHER DIDN'T AND HOW.

00:19:27.232 --> 00:19:28.534
THEY RUN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:30.269
ONE DISTRICT IS ON THE COMMUNITY

00:19:30.335 --> 00:19:31.937
COLLEGES LIST BUT IT DOESN'T.

00:19:32.004 --> 00:19:33.505
MANAGE TO MAKE ITS WAY TO THE

00:19:33.572 --> 00:19:36.041
FINAL DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LIST.

00:19:36.108 --> 00:19:37.276
AND I DON'T HAVE AN EXPLANATION

00:19:37.342 --> 00:19:38.844
FOR THEM.

00:19:38.911 --> 00:19:41.179
BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

00:19:41.246 --> 00:19:43.482
THE THE SELECTIONS ARE MADE AND

00:19:43.549 --> 00:19:45.884
TO BE FRANK -- I'VE NEVER REALLY

00:19:45.951 --> 00:19:48.787
HAD A EXPLANATION.

00:19:48.854 --> 00:19:50.689
WHEN I ASK QUESTIONS THAT I'VE

00:19:50.756 --> 00:19:52.658
BEEN ABLE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:55.527
AND THEN IN TURN ARTICULATE BACK

00:19:55.594 --> 00:19:56.061
TO THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

00:19:56.128 --> 00:19:57.262
APPROACHED ME?

00:19:57.329 --> 00:19:58.897
AS TO WHY THEY DIDN'T GET PICKED

00:19:58.964 --> 00:20:00.966
BECAUSE THIS IT WILL LOOK AT THE

00:20:01.033 --> 00:20:01.533
HEALTH THE HEALTH AND SAFETY

00:20:01.600 --> 00:20:02.034
PROJECT.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:03.201
AND IT MAY BE A MATH AND SCIENCE

00:20:03.268 --> 00:20:05.737
BUILDING.

00:20:05.804 --> 00:20:07.306
BUT THEN I SAID WELL LOOK THIS

00:20:07.372 --> 00:20:09.041
DISTRICT OVER HERE ON THE COAST

00:20:09.107 --> 00:20:10.642
THAT DISTRICT GOT A MAT MATH AND

00:20:10.709 --> 00:20:11.777
SCIENCE BUILDING THAT HAD A

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:13.245
HEALTH AND SAFETY.

00:20:13.312 --> 00:20:17.149
ISSUE IS THE SAME PRIORITY ONE

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:17.716
TWO THREE FOUR WHATEVER YOU

00:20:17.783 --> 00:20:20.452
CLASSIFY THEM AS OUR FINANCE

00:20:20.519 --> 00:20:22.888
WHOEVER HAS A CLASSIFICATION.

00:20:22.955 --> 00:20:24.823
AND I SAY I DON'T KNOW.

00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:27.292
AND I'M I GUESS I'M.

00:20:27.359 --> 00:20:28.994
I'M I I OWN A LECTURE I GUESS

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.096
WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT WE

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:33.165
FIGURE OUT A WAY TO DO. TO

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.800
DESIGN A PROCESS.

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:37.336
THAT IS MORE TRANSPARENT WE'RE

00:20:37.402 --> 00:20:39.137
GOING IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:20:39.204 --> 00:20:40.872
DISTRICTS HAVE A CLEAR

00:20:40.939 --> 00:20:42.207
UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE

00:20:42.274 --> 00:20:43.508
STANDARDS ARE.

00:20:43.575 --> 00:20:44.610
THAT THEY HAVE TO MEET

00:20:44.676 --> 00:20:46.044
RECOGNIZING WILL NEVER HAVE

00:20:46.111 --> 00:20:47.479
ENOUGH MONEY.

00:20:47.546 --> 00:20:49.414
THAT HAS A PRIORITIZATION SYSTEM

00:20:49.481 --> 00:20:51.283
ATTACHED TO IT SO THEY CAN SORT

00:20:51.350 --> 00:20:52.517
OF FIGURE OUT WHETHER THEY'RE IN

00:20:52.584 --> 00:20:56.088
THE TOP 25% OF THE BOTTOM 25%.

00:20:56.154 --> 00:20:57.456
AND THEY KNOW WHAT THE CHANCES

00:20:57.522 --> 00:20:59.257
ARE SO AT THE END OF THE DAY

00:20:59.324 --> 00:21:00.726
WHEN THEY'RE DISAPPOINTED.

00:21:00.792 --> 00:21:02.561
AS OBVIOUSLY SOME OF THEM ARE

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:04.262
GOING TO BE THEY UNDERSTAND.

00:21:04.329 --> 00:21:05.964
WHY THE DIS DISAPPOINTMENT IS

00:21:06.031 --> 00:21:07.299
FLOWING THEIR WAY I'LL GIVE YOU

00:21:07.366 --> 00:21:08.934
AN EXAMPLE NOT THIS IS NOT IN

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:10.769
THE SENATE DISTRICT?

00:21:10.836 --> 00:21:11.903
SO IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ME

00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.873
PERSONALLY -- DISTRICT CAME TO

00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:15.674
ME THEY SAID WE HAVE A WE HAD A

00:21:15.741 --> 00:21:17.275
VERY WE HAD A HIGH PRIORITY

00:21:17.342 --> 00:21:18.543
HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE HAVING

00:21:18.610 --> 00:21:20.145
TO DO WITH THE SCIENCE BUILDING --

00:21:20.212 --> 00:21:21.747
GROSS ANATOMY LABS AND ALL THIS

00:21:21.813 --> 00:21:23.515
OTHER STUFF THAT APPARENTLY THEM

00:21:23.582 --> 00:21:24.950
I DON'T KNOW WHETHER WAS H. FEES

00:21:25.017 --> 00:21:26.318
VENTILATION ISSUE OR WHAT.

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:27.185
THEY HAD TO MOVE ALL THOSE

00:21:27.252 --> 00:21:29.554
THINGS OUT AND THEY SET HIM UP

00:21:29.621 --> 00:21:32.257
IN PORTABLES.

00:21:32.324 --> 00:21:34.026
WHAT THEY TOLD ME I DON'T KNOW

00:21:34.092 --> 00:21:34.359
WHETHER IT'S?

00:21:34.426 --> 00:21:35.460
ACCURATE.

00:21:35.527 --> 00:21:37.195
I'M JUST REPORTING.

00:21:37.262 --> 00:21:39.164
IS IT BECAUSE THEY RELOCATED

00:21:39.231 --> 00:21:40.565
THEIR LABS IN PORTABLE

00:21:40.632 --> 00:21:42.668
FACILITIES ON THE CAMPUS AT CUT

00:21:42.734 --> 00:21:45.637
THEM OUT OF THE PROCESS.

00:21:45.704 --> 00:21:46.838
FOR OBTAINING A HEALTH AND

00:21:46.905 --> 00:21:47.239
SAFETY.

00:21:47.305 --> 00:21:50.575
OF A PROJECT APPROVAL IN THIS

00:21:50.642 --> 00:21:51.843
SYSTEM WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NOW

00:21:51.910 --> 00:21:53.311
AGAIN I DON'T KNOW WHETHER

00:21:53.378 --> 00:21:54.446
THAT'S ACCURATE OR NOT.

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:56.782
BUT IF IT IS OR EVEN PART OF IT

00:21:56.848 --> 00:21:58.350
IS ACCURATE I THINK THAT'S

00:21:58.417 --> 00:22:00.052
SOMETHING WE NEED TO LOOK AT SO

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.019
YOU HAVE A IF YOU HAVE A

00:22:01.086 --> 00:22:02.888
DISTRICT IS ATTEMPTING TO KEEP

00:22:02.954 --> 00:22:04.156
PEOPLE SAFE.

00:22:04.222 --> 00:22:05.857
EVEN ON A TEMPORARY BASIS AND

00:22:05.924 --> 00:22:09.027
THEN DOESN'T QUALIFY -- FOR

00:22:09.094 --> 00:22:11.329
CONSIDERATION OR APPROVAL ON ONE

00:22:11.396 --> 00:22:14.833
OF THESE PROJECTS LIST -- MAYBE

00:22:14.900 --> 00:22:15.667
THERE WERE HIGHER PRIORITY

00:22:15.734 --> 00:22:18.136
PROJECTS -- MAYBE THERE WAS A

00:22:18.203 --> 00:22:19.705
REASON.

00:22:19.771 --> 00:22:21.606
BUT THE DIFFICULTY IS THE

00:22:21.673 --> 00:22:23.408
REASONS NOT CLEARLY COMMUNICATED

00:22:23.475 --> 00:22:24.876
TO THE DISTRICT SO THEY DON'T

00:22:24.943 --> 00:22:26.044
REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT THE

00:22:26.111 --> 00:22:28.580
PROBLEM IS.

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.048
AND THEN THEY COME TO PEOPLE IF

00:22:30.115 --> 00:22:31.650
SOMEBODY LIKE ME AND I CAN'T

00:22:31.717 --> 00:22:33.318
EXPLAIN IT EITHER SO.

00:22:33.385 --> 00:22:35.287
I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS THAT

00:22:35.353 --> 00:22:40.158
WE FIGURE OUT -- A BETTER WAY.

00:22:40.225 --> 00:22:44.096
TO DISCONNECT WHEN IT COMES.

00:22:44.162 --> 00:22:45.497
TO IDENTIFYING THESE PROJECTS

00:22:45.564 --> 00:22:46.865
GRADING THEM SCORING THEM

00:22:46.932 --> 00:22:48.700
LISTING THEM.

00:22:48.767 --> 00:22:51.236
BECAUSE IT'S IT'S ALMOST LIKE I

00:22:51.303 --> 00:22:51.870
DON'T KNOW THE SELECTION OF THE

00:22:51.937 --> 00:22:53.705
POPE.

00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:54.906
IN A PUFF OF SMOKE COMES OUT OF

00:22:54.973 --> 00:22:56.241
THE TOP OF THE CAPITAL AND WE

00:22:56.308 --> 00:22:57.843
GET A LIST AND NOBODY REALLY

00:22:57.909 --> 00:22:58.643
KNOWS.

00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:00.312
WHO VOTED FOR WATER HOW YOU MADE

00:23:00.378 --> 00:23:01.613
IT TO THE LIST AND?

00:23:01.680 --> 00:23:03.515
AND IF IT'S NOT YOUR LIST YEAH

00:23:03.582 --> 00:23:04.783
THEN YOU CAN EXPLAIN IT

00:23:04.850 --> 00:23:06.251
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:23:06.318 --> 00:23:07.652
SYSTEM.

00:23:07.719 --> 00:23:12.224
AND I DON'T KNOW -- WHAT HAPPENS

00:23:12.290 --> 00:23:13.759
ON THE FIRST FLOOR I RESPECT

00:23:13.825 --> 00:23:15.293
WHAT HAPPENS ON THE FIRST FLOOR

00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:16.661
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO BE ABLE

00:23:16.728 --> 00:23:19.064
TO COMMUNICATE [inaudible]

00:23:19.131 --> 00:23:21.600
TRY MAYBE.

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:22.167
BEFORE WE GO ON IF YOU DON'T

00:23:22.234 --> 00:23:24.236
MIND.

00:23:24.302 --> 00:23:24.536
SO.

00:23:24.603 --> 00:23:25.137
HE'S ALWAYS HEAR PEOPLE TALK

00:23:25.203 --> 00:23:26.004
ABOUT BREAKING DOWN SILOS AND I

00:23:26.071 --> 00:23:27.539
USED TO REALLY NOT UNDERSTAND

00:23:27.606 --> 00:23:28.840
THAT AND THOUGHT IT MADE NO

00:23:28.907 --> 00:23:30.609
SENSE UNTIL I GOT THIS JOB.

00:23:30.675 --> 00:23:32.244
AND IT IS SHOCKING HOW PEOPLE

00:23:32.310 --> 00:23:35.080
WORK IN SILOS AND TO THE CHAIR'S

00:23:35.147 --> 00:23:36.882
POINT WE WE DON'T COMMUNICATE

00:23:36.948 --> 00:23:39.384
WITH EACH OTHER THEN WE GET LEFT

00:23:39.451 --> 00:23:41.119
WONDERING WHAT'S HAPPENING -- I

ALWAYS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S

00:23:43.789 --> 00:23:46.258
HAPPENING BUT TO RICHARD'S POINT

00:23:46.324 --> 00:23:48.026

00:23:54.232 --> 00:23:55.300
LIST.

00:23:55.367 --> 00:23:57.169
THE EXAMPLE THAT YOU GAVE IT IS

00:23:57.235 --> 00:23:59.104
INCREDIBLE I MEAN WE JUST I

00:23:59.171 --> 00:24:00.405

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:05.710
BAD NEWS.

00:24:05.777 --> 00:24:07.078
AS LONG AS YOU TELL THEM WHAT'S

00:24:07.145 --> 00:24:08.814
GOING ON AND THEY UNDERSTAND

00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:10.982

00:24:48.753 --> 00:24:49.221
WE'VE BEEN RE SUBMITTING

00:24:49.287 --> 00:24:51.423
PROJECTS POPS OF PROJECTS THAT

00:24:51.489 --> 00:24:52.891
HAVE BEEN ON OUR APPROVED LISTS

00:24:52.958 --> 00:24:54.059
THAT WERE INCLUDED IN THE

00:24:54.125 --> 00:24:55.493
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUR PRACTICES

00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.761
BEEN -- TO TO RESUBMIT PROJECTS

00:24:56.828 --> 00:24:58.296
ARE THEIR CONDITIONS UNDER WHICH

00:24:58.363 --> 00:25:00.498
THOSE PROJECTS MIGHT DROP OFF

00:25:00.565 --> 00:25:02.300
THE LIST AND IN IN IN.

00:25:02.367 --> 00:25:03.668
IN WHAT WOULD THOSE CONDITIONS

00:25:03.735 --> 00:25:05.036
BE IT SO TO THE EXTENT THE

00:25:05.103 --> 00:25:06.538
INFRASTRUCTURE NEED NO LONGER

00:25:06.605 --> 00:25:07.973
EXISTS BUT IF IF THAT IS A VERY

00:25:08.039 --> 00:25:10.008
LIMITED -- SET OF PROJECTS SO IT

00:25:10.075 --> 00:25:12.277
IS OUR PRACTICE IN GENERAL WOULD

00:25:12.344 --> 00:25:14.079
BE TO RESUBMIT. TEN MAYBE I'M

00:25:14.145 --> 00:25:16.781
JUST I THINK THAT YOUR POINT --

00:25:16.848 --> 00:25:18.416
TO BOTH OF THE POINTS -- I THINK

00:25:18.483 --> 00:25:19.084
THERE ARE SOME CRITICAL

00:25:19.150 --> 00:25:21.253
QUESTIONS THAT THERE IS INSURED

00:25:21.319 --> 00:25:23.722
AGREEMENT ACROSS THE PARTIES

00:25:23.788 --> 00:25:25.490
HERE -- ABOUT.

00:25:25.557 --> 00:25:26.591
HOW WE APPROACH THIS YEAR TO

00:25:26.658 --> 00:25:28.627
YEAR I THINK THE CORE ONE ONE

00:25:28.693 --> 00:25:30.195
CORE ONE IS HOW MUCH MONEY?

00:25:30.262 --> 00:25:32.197
ARE WE GOING TO SPEND IN A GIVEN

00:25:32.264 --> 00:25:33.732
YEAR -- SEARCH YOUR POINT ARE WE

00:25:33.798 --> 00:25:35.066
SPENDING ALL TWO BILLION AND

00:25:35.133 --> 00:25:37.269
PROP -- PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE

00:25:37.335 --> 00:25:39.671
FUNDS ARE WE SPOT APPORTIONING

00:25:39.738 --> 00:25:41.973
IT OUT OVER SOME PERIOD OF YEARS

00:25:42.040 --> 00:25:47.145
I THINK THERE IS WE'VE HAD WE

00:25:47.212 --> 00:25:48.613
HAD SOME PLANS INITIALLY.

00:25:48.680 --> 00:25:49.714
THE SUSPENDED OVER A FORTY FIVE

00:25:49.781 --> 00:25:50.749
YEAR PERIOD THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

00:25:50.815 --> 00:25:52.083
DIFFERENT ON THE GOVERNOR'S

00:25:52.150 --> 00:25:52.684
EIGHT TO NINE YEARS AND SO.

00:25:52.751 --> 00:25:53.885
I THINK THAT'S A KEY QUESTION

00:25:53.952 --> 00:25:54.920
THAT AFFECTS HOW WE WHAT WE TELL

00:25:54.986 --> 00:25:56.488
COMMUNITY COLLEGES I THINK THAT

00:25:56.554 --> 00:25:58.023
THE OTHER QUESTION IS.

00:25:58.089 --> 00:25:59.858
ONCE YOU DECIDE ON THAT POT HOW

00:25:59.925 --> 00:26:01.826
MUCH HOW DO YOU PRIORITIZE

00:26:01.893 --> 00:26:03.328
PROJECTS WITHIN THAT POT.

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.129
BUT I WILL SAY YOU KNOW I THINK

00:26:04.195 --> 00:26:06.164
WE SHARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:26:06.231 --> 00:26:07.399
THAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

00:26:07.465 --> 00:26:09.567
OFFICE IS RAISED THAT A FIRE

00:26:09.634 --> 00:26:12.971
LIFE SAFETY -- CRITERIA CREATES --

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:15.073
CONCERNING INCENTIVESWHEN MOST

00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:16.775
OF THE MONEY IS LOCAL SO WHAT

00:26:16.841 --> 00:26:18.343
ARE YOU SPENDING YOUR LOCAL

00:26:18.410 --> 00:26:19.778
MONEY ON ND AND WHAT INCENTIVES

00:26:19.844 --> 00:26:23.415
THAT IS A CREATE -- TO TO MAKE

00:26:23.481 --> 00:26:25.650
SURE YOUR FACILITY IS --

00:26:25.717 --> 00:26:29.054
SUFFICIENTLY -- CONCERNING -- TO

00:26:29.120 --> 00:26:30.522
TO RECEIVE STATE FUNDS HOW TO

00:26:30.588 --> 00:26:31.856
YOUR POINT ABOUT KIND OF JUST

00:26:31.923 --> 00:26:33.725
THIS QUESTION OF WHAT WE TELLING

00:26:33.792 --> 00:26:36.094
COLLEGES SO. TO GROSSLY

00:26:36.161 --> 00:26:38.430
OVERSIMPLIFY THIS PROCESS -- YOU

00:26:38.496 --> 00:26:40.532
KNOW WE MAY SEND TWO PROJECTS TO

00:26:40.598 --> 00:26:41.533
THE GOVERNOR ON TO THE

00:26:41.599 --> 00:26:43.435
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE BECAUSE WE

00:26:43.501 --> 00:26:45.704
THOUGHT THEY WERE ESPECIALLY

00:26:45.770 --> 00:26:46.237
IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS SOME

00:26:46.304 --> 00:26:47.172
ROLLING.

00:26:47.238 --> 00:26:48.540
OUT BOTH COLLEGES HAVE

00:26:48.606 --> 00:26:50.075
SIGNIFICANT ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:26:50.141 --> 00:26:50.742
LET'S SAY EQUAL ENROLLMENT

00:26:50.809 --> 00:26:55.313
GROWTH BOTH NEEDED NEW CLASSROOM

00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:58.883
FACILITIES -- I THINK IN

00:26:58.950 --> 00:27:00.285
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT AND

00:27:00.352 --> 00:27:00.885
SHOULD KIND OF WAY AND BUT YOU

00:27:00.952 --> 00:27:01.453
KNOW THAT WHEN THEY GET TO

00:27:01.519 --> 00:27:03.655
FINANCE THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH

00:27:03.722 --> 00:27:05.357
PLANS GOES AWAY.

00:27:05.423 --> 00:27:06.558
AND MEDIA OUT LIFE FIRE LIFE

00:27:06.624 --> 00:27:07.492
SAFETY ONCE THAT BEGINS TO GET

00:27:07.559 --> 00:27:07.759
APPLIED.

00:27:07.826 --> 00:27:08.526
AND SO THIS PROJECT THAT WE SENT

00:27:08.593 --> 00:27:11.196
BECAUSE WE THOUGHT IT WAS THE

00:27:11.262 --> 00:27:11.830
HIGHEST PRIORITY FOR ENROLLMENT

00:27:11.896 --> 00:27:12.630
GROWTH.

00:27:12.697 --> 00:27:13.631
ACTUALLY MIGHT DROP OFF THE LIST

00:27:13.698 --> 00:27:15.133
BECAUSE ENROLLMENT GROWTH WASN'T

00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:16.901
THE LANDS AND THE OTHER PROJECT

00:27:16.968 --> 00:27:18.670
MIGHT GO FORWARD BECAUSE THAT'S

00:27:18.737 --> 00:27:19.237
THE DIFFERENT LINES FINANCE

00:27:19.304 --> 00:27:20.205
SUPPLIES.

00:27:20.271 --> 00:27:22.173
I WILL JUST CLOSE BY SAYING YOU

00:27:22.240 --> 00:27:23.908
KNOW I THINK WE ARE THE WE HAVE

00:27:23.975 --> 00:27:24.776
THE LEAST AUTHORITY IN THERE

00:27:24.843 --> 00:27:26.044
ACROSS THE PLAYERS IN THE ROOM

00:27:26.111 --> 00:27:27.212
SO.

00:27:27.278 --> 00:27:27.712
YOU KNOW I THINK IF THE

00:27:27.779 --> 00:27:29.881
DIRECTION WAS WE WANT ONLY

00:27:29.948 --> 00:27:31.649
PROJECTS THAT ADDRESS FIRE LIFE

00:27:31.716 --> 00:27:32.150
SAFETY I THINK THAT'S A

00:27:32.217 --> 00:27:33.351
CONVERSATION WEEK WE WOULD HAVE

00:27:33.418 --> 00:27:35.453
THE SYSTEM OF YOU KNOW MAYBE WE

00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.888
SHOULD BEGIN TO PRIORITIZE ONLY

00:27:36.955 --> 00:27:39.157
ON FIRE LIFE SAFETY.

00:27:39.224 --> 00:27:40.825
AGAIN THOUGH I THINK THOSE -- I

00:27:40.892 --> 00:27:41.726
THINK WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

00:27:41.793 --> 00:27:43.194
INCENTIVES AND WOULD WANT TO

00:27:43.261 --> 00:27:44.429
HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE OLD --

00:27:44.496 --> 00:27:45.964
BEFORE WE DID THAT WELL IT SEEMS

00:27:46.031 --> 00:27:47.065
TO ME THERE A COUPLE WAYS TO DO

00:27:47.132 --> 00:27:48.700
IT THE NEXT TIME THERE'S A BOND

00:27:48.767 --> 00:27:49.701
ISSUE WE COULD.

00:27:49.768 --> 00:27:51.202
DO WHAT WE'VE DONE IN OTHER BOND

00:27:51.269 --> 00:27:53.004
ISSUES WHICH IS I THINK WHICH IS

00:27:53.071 --> 00:27:54.773
SPECIFIED THAT CERTAIN PORTIONS

00:27:54.839 --> 00:27:56.041
OF THE BOND WE USE BOND FUNDS

00:27:56.107 --> 00:27:57.542
WILL BE USED FOR THIS AND

00:27:57.609 --> 00:28:01.179
CERTAIN PORTIONS BE USED.

00:28:01.246 --> 00:28:02.213
FOR SOMETHING ELSE KNOW THAT.

00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:02.847
THAT SORT OF ELIMINATES

00:28:02.914 --> 00:28:03.548
FLEXIBILITY.

00:28:03.615 --> 00:28:05.450
IN THE PROCESS AND I'M ONE FOR

00:28:05.517 --> 00:28:07.519
FLEXIBILITY JUST AS I'M ONE

00:28:07.585 --> 00:28:09.554
GENERAL OF ONE FOR LOCAL CONTROL

00:28:09.621 --> 00:28:10.555
WE CAN DO IT SO.

00:28:10.622 --> 00:28:12.690
I'D BE A LITTLE RELUCTANT TO DO

00:28:12.757 --> 00:28:14.059
THAT BUT YOU SEE I WOULD SEEM

00:28:14.125 --> 00:28:15.693
SEEMS TO ME THAT WE OUGHT TO

00:28:15.760 --> 00:28:17.162
COME TO SOME AGREEMENT.

00:28:17.228 --> 00:28:19.597
AS TO WHAT PORTION OF THE MONEY.

00:28:19.664 --> 00:28:20.832
OUGHT TO BE GENERAL USE FOR LIFE

00:28:20.899 --> 00:28:22.667
SAFETY ISSUES AND WHAT PORTION

00:28:22.734 --> 00:28:24.235
CAN BE USED FOR ENROLLMENT

00:29:47.585 --> 00:29:50.188
DID A REALLY BAD JOB WHILE WHILE

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:51.856

LIFE SAFETY NEEDS IN THE END

00:30:09.807 --> 00:30:10.909
THAT FACILITATES GUESS IF YOU

00:30:10.975 --> 00:30:12.510
VISITED IT YOU WOULD KNOW THAT

00:30:12.577 --> 00:30:14.279
THERE'S FIRE.

00:30:14.345 --> 00:30:15.346
FORTUNATELY THEY'RE SO MANY IT --

00:30:15.413 --> 00:30:20.952
BUT IT IT WAS -- SO THAT BEING

00:30:21.019 --> 00:30:22.420
THE CASE THE THE NEXT STEP WOULD

00:30:22.487 --> 00:30:24.489
BE APPROVAL OF THE LEGISLATURE --

00:30:24.556 --> 00:30:26.824
BUT BY THE LEGISLATURE AND AND

00:30:26.891 --> 00:30:28.259
STANDING BY TO GO FROM THERE

00:30:28.326 --> 00:30:30.728
ONCE THAT IS DONE SO JULY -- ONE

00:30:30.795 --> 00:30:32.530
WE GO INTO THE BASICALLY THE

00:30:32.597 --> 00:30:34.365
PUBLIC WORKS BOARD FACE THE

00:30:34.432 --> 00:30:35.867
CHANCES OFFICE WILL WILL THE

00:30:35.934 --> 00:30:37.168
MINUTE -- FUNDING IT GETS

00:30:37.235 --> 00:30:39.704
ENCUMBERED AND IT'S OFF AND

00:30:39.771 --> 00:30:41.239
RUNNING.

00:30:41.306 --> 00:30:43.408
AWESOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:44.442
I ALSO JUST WHILE I HAVE IT ON

00:30:44.509 --> 00:30:45.410
WANTED TO SAY THAT CHRISTIAN IS

00:30:45.476 --> 00:30:46.611
PRETTY ACCURATE IN IN THAT AND

00:30:46.678 --> 00:30:47.512
ROMAN CATHOLIC POPULATION

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.547
EXAMPLE -- THERE'S A LOT OF

00:30:49.614 --> 00:30:52.183
COMMUNICATION THAT WE HAVE WITH

00:30:52.250 --> 00:30:54.786
THE CHANCES OFFICE DURING OUR

00:30:54.852 --> 00:30:55.853
VALUATIONS.

00:30:55.920 --> 00:30:57.355
BUT THAT SAID THE ADMINISTRATION

00:30:57.422 --> 00:30:59.324
PERSPECTIVE IS THAT THE

00:30:59.390 --> 00:31:00.825
ENROLLMENT ISSUE SHOULD BE DEALT

00:31:00.892 --> 00:31:02.760
WITH LOCALLY THAT SINCE WE HAVE

00:31:02.827 --> 00:31:04.562
A FIXED PART OF STATE FUNDS WE

00:31:04.629 --> 00:31:05.763
SHOULD BE AT AND THAT STATE

00:31:05.830 --> 00:31:08.266
FUNDS JUST A FRACTION OF THE THE

00:31:08.333 --> 00:31:09.801
OVERALL NEED EVEN WHEN.

00:31:09.867 --> 00:31:11.836
TAKING LIKE MODERNIZATION THING --

00:31:11.903 --> 00:31:13.371
THIS FIRE LIFE SAFETY IN THERE

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:14.872
THAT WE FEEL THAT THE STATE

00:31:14.939 --> 00:31:17.075
FUNDS SHOULD BE ENSURING THAT

00:31:17.141 --> 00:31:19.077
THE THE STAFF STUDENTS AND

00:31:19.143 --> 00:31:20.578
FACULTY THAT ATTEND THESE

00:31:20.645 --> 00:31:21.779
COLLEGES OR SAY.

00:31:21.846 --> 00:31:23.147
I DON'T NECESSARILY DISAGREE

00:31:23.214 --> 00:31:24.048
WITH THAT I GUESS OR SOME

00:31:24.115 --> 00:31:25.450
EXCEPTIONS DEPENDING ON THE

00:31:25.516 --> 00:31:26.818
DEMOGRAPHICS AND WHAT

00:31:26.884 --> 00:31:28.119
COMMUNITIES WERE TALKING ABOUT

00:31:28.186 --> 00:31:29.120
SUMMER.

00:31:29.187 --> 00:31:30.555
MORE ABLE THAN OTHERS TO BEAR

00:31:30.622 --> 00:31:34.626
THE LOAD OF OF LOCAL MEASURES

00:31:34.692 --> 00:31:38.229
BUT BUT I I MICHAEL.

00:31:38.296 --> 00:31:40.298
MY COLLEAGUE'S QUESTION.

00:31:40.365 --> 00:31:43.034
RAISES A POINT AND THAT IS HOW

00:31:43.101 --> 00:31:45.536
DO WE COMMUNICATE TO TWO

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:47.939
DISTRICTS AROUND THE STATE.

00:31:48.006 --> 00:31:50.141
WHAT GOOD PROPOSALS ARE?

00:31:50.208 --> 00:31:51.576
WHAT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR IN

00:31:51.643 --> 00:31:53.511
TERMS OF?

00:31:53.578 --> 00:31:54.445
THE PROPOSED THE KIND OF

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:56.247
PROPOSALS THAT FLOAT TO THE TOP

00:31:56.314 --> 00:32:00.852
AND AND RECEIVE APPROVAL -- AM I

00:32:00.918 --> 00:32:02.754
MAKING SENSE DO WE DO YOU

00:32:02.820 --> 00:32:04.188
COMMUNICATE BECAUSE YOU HAVE

00:32:04.255 --> 00:32:06.591
DISTRICTS OF VARYING SIZES AND

00:32:06.658 --> 00:32:08.326
I'M SURE SOME HAVE FLEETS OF

00:32:08.393 --> 00:32:09.761
PEOPLE WHO UNDERSTAND.

00:32:09.827 --> 00:32:11.963
HOW THIS PROCESS WORKS AND SOME

00:32:12.030 --> 00:32:13.631
PROBABLY DON'T?

00:32:13.698 --> 00:32:15.166
AND EVERYBODY SHOULD YOU KNOW

00:32:15.233 --> 00:32:17.101
COME TO THE TABLE WITH AN EQUAL

00:32:17.168 --> 00:32:19.304
OPPORTUNITY SO.

00:32:19.370 --> 00:32:21.506
YET IF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

00:32:21.572 --> 00:32:23.574
SYSTEM THE SYSTEM OFFICE DOESN'T.

00:32:23.641 --> 00:32:24.909
DOESN'T REALLY HAVE A GRASP OF

00:32:24.976 --> 00:32:26.244
WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND DEPARTMENT

00:32:26.311 --> 00:32:27.845
OF FINANCE THEN YOU'RE GOING TO

00:32:27.912 --> 00:32:29.080
BE UNABLE.

00:32:29.147 --> 00:32:30.615
TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES WITH THE

00:32:30.682 --> 00:32:32.817
COMMUNITY THE HUNDRED AND

00:32:32.884 --> 00:32:33.551
FOURTEEN OF THEM THAT WE HAVE

00:32:33.618 --> 00:32:36.321
AROUND. FIFTEEN SKEWS ME ONLINE

00:32:36.387 --> 00:32:38.856
RIGHT -- HOPEFULLY THEY DON'T

00:32:38.923 --> 00:32:41.392
HAVE ANY.

00:32:41.459 --> 00:32:42.694
LIFE SAFETY AND MAINTENANCE

00:32:42.760 --> 00:32:44.729
NEEDS JUST YET.

00:32:44.796 --> 00:32:47.265
I DON'T THINK SO WE'LL HERE SOON --

WE HAVE A STAFF OF THAT WORKS ON

00:32:53.671 --> 00:32:54.972
WITH THE DEPARTMENT FINANCING

00:32:55.039 --> 00:32:56.774
CAPITAL OUTLAY REQUEST AFTER WE

00:32:56.841 --> 00:32:58.343
RUN THROUGH OUR PROCESS AGAIN

00:32:58.409 --> 00:33:01.446
WHICH WE THINK -- YOU KNOW TRIES

00:33:01.512 --> 00:33:03.314
TO AS OBJECTIVELY USING STATED

00:33:03.381 --> 00:33:04.849
CRITERIA -- DETERMINE THE

00:33:04.916 --> 00:33:06.217
HIGHEST PRIORITIES YOU KNOW WE

00:33:06.284 --> 00:33:07.318
ARE WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT

00:33:07.385 --> 00:33:08.986
OF FINANCE TO MAKE THE CASE FOR

00:33:09.053 --> 00:33:11.255
THOSE PROJECTS AND HOPEFULLY --

00:33:11.322 --> 00:33:14.425
WRITING SUFFICIENTLY COMPELLING --

00:33:14.492 --> 00:33:17.261
BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSALS TO GET

THE REQUEST FOR FINANCE.

00:33:23.067 --> 00:33:24.535
SO FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE

00:33:24.602 --> 00:33:26.170
CONTACTED ME AND THINK THEY WERE

00:33:26.237 --> 00:33:27.405
DROPPED FROM THE LIST AND WERE

00:33:27.472 --> 00:33:28.673

ALL TO FIGURE OUT WHAT HAPPENED.

00:33:36.013 --> 00:33:36.748
YES.

00:33:36.814 --> 00:33:38.249
PERFECT ONE FINAL QUESTION ON

00:33:38.316 --> 00:33:39.817
THIS BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO THE

00:33:39.884 --> 00:33:41.819
NEXT ISSUE AND THAT'S THE THAT'S

00:33:41.886 --> 00:33:43.888
THE FUTURE ACTION PEAS.

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:46.057
AND YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THE

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:49.127
ANALYSIS TALKS ABOUT -- VISION

00:33:49.193 --> 00:33:51.763
FOR SUCCESS LOW INCOME ENGLISH

00:33:51.829 --> 00:33:55.166
ESL STUDENTS THE CARD SERVICES

00:33:55.233 --> 00:33:56.434
SERVICE CENTER -- OBVIOUSLY.

00:33:56.501 --> 00:33:58.035
A VERY VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF

00:33:58.102 --> 00:33:59.504
COMMUNITY COLLEGE EDUCATION.

00:33:59.570 --> 00:34:01.406
THERE ARE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN

00:34:01.472 --> 00:34:03.074
THE STATE THAT ARE LOCATED IN

00:34:03.141 --> 00:34:04.876
AREAS THAT ARE NOT QUITE OF DEMO

00:34:04.942 --> 00:34:07.645
GOOD DEMOGRAPHICALLY CHALLENGED.

00:34:07.712 --> 00:34:09.614
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY WILL BE

00:34:09.680 --> 00:34:10.415
THAT THOSE DISTRICTS WILL BE

00:34:10.481 --> 00:34:12.750
DISADVANTAGED WHEN IT COMES.

00:34:12.817 --> 00:34:16.687
TO THIS -- BOND FINANCE THE

00:34:16.754 --> 00:34:18.723
MAINTENANCE IMPROVEMENT.

00:34:18.790 --> 00:34:21.526
PEACE SO I WOULD JUST I WOULD.

00:34:21.592 --> 00:34:23.027
OPEN BY SAYING WE ARE -- EARLY

00:34:23.094 --> 00:34:25.329
IN OUR PROCESS WE CERTAINLY NEED

00:34:25.396 --> 00:34:26.731
TO SEEK MORE CONSULTATION FROM

00:34:26.798 --> 00:34:28.166
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN

00:34:28.232 --> 00:34:30.201
WORKING WITH A WORKER PRIMARILY

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:32.370
OF CHIEF BUSINESS OFFICIALS.

00:34:32.437 --> 00:34:34.205
AND FACILITIES DIRECTORS ON

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:36.641
ALTERNATIVES -- I THINK IT FITS

00:34:36.707 --> 00:34:38.409
INTO THIS CONVERSATION BY SAYING

00:34:38.476 --> 00:34:41.312
OF THE THIRTY BILLION WE EXPECT.

00:34:41.379 --> 00:34:42.914
MUCH OF IT MOST OF IT WILL BE

00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:44.182
FUNDED LOCALLY.

00:34:44.248 --> 00:34:45.983
WE ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

00:34:46.050 --> 00:34:47.418
STATE FUNDS ARE GOING TO BE

00:34:47.485 --> 00:34:49.554
LIMITED AND SO HOW DO WE BEST

00:34:49.620 --> 00:34:54.459
PRIORITIZE -- THE PROJECTS THAT --

00:34:54.525 --> 00:34:55.059
THAT CAN BE FUNDED WITH STATE

00:34:55.126 --> 00:34:56.961
FUNDS TO YOUR EARLIER POINT

00:34:57.028 --> 00:34:57.762
COMMUNITIES HAVE DIFFERENT

00:34:57.829 --> 00:34:59.864
ABILITY TO RAISE LOCAL FUNDS AND

00:34:59.931 --> 00:35:01.499
SO WE THINK ABOUT IT -- THAT IT

00:35:01.566 --> 00:35:03.968
WOULD BE REASONABLE TO CONSIDER

00:35:04.035 --> 00:35:06.437
THAT COMMUNITIES -- THE PROPERTY

00:35:06.504 --> 00:35:09.006
TAX BASE IS A WAY OF THINKING

00:35:09.073 --> 00:35:09.574
ABOUT WHAT CAN BE GENERATED

00:35:09.640 --> 00:35:10.608
LOCALLY.

00:35:10.675 --> 00:35:12.443
AND WE THINK THE CASE HAS LONG

00:35:12.510 --> 00:35:13.878
BEEN MADE WE'VE MADE THE CASE

00:35:13.945 --> 00:35:14.979
THAT FACILITIES ARE AN IMPORTANT

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:16.481
PART OF IMPROVING STUDENT

00:35:16.547 --> 00:35:18.583
SUCCESS SO THAT WE SHOULD THINK

00:35:18.649 --> 00:35:19.917
OF IT AS A KEY LEVER.

00:35:19.984 --> 00:35:22.153
AS WE THINK ABOUT OUR GOAL TO

00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.387
BUY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE CLOSE

00:35:23.454 --> 00:35:26.424
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS ACROSS REGIONS

00:35:26.491 --> 00:35:28.326
ACROSS -- PARTICULARLY --

00:35:28.392 --> 00:35:29.627
HISTORICALLY DISADVANTAGED

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:31.562
GROUPS SO I THOUGHT YOU KNOW

00:35:31.629 --> 00:35:35.199
WHAT WE HAVE OF SCENTED AS AN

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:36.133
ALTERNATIVE AS ONE IDEA FOR THE

00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:36.968
SYSTEM.

00:35:37.034 --> 00:35:38.503
IS BEGINNING TO INCORPORATE

00:35:38.569 --> 00:35:41.372
MEASURES OF NEED -- AND THEN

00:35:41.439 --> 00:35:43.007
ALSO BEGINNING TO THINK ABOUT

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:45.776
HOW DO WE RE FRAME OUR CATEGORY

00:35:45.843 --> 00:35:48.012
SO THAT DISTRICTS ARE FORCED TO

00:35:48.079 --> 00:35:49.680
CHOOSE BETWEEN -- WHETHER A

00:35:49.747 --> 00:35:51.616
FACILITY IS -- COMPETES AS AN

00:35:51.682 --> 00:35:52.717
INSTRUCTIONAL FACILITY OR AS A

00:35:52.783 --> 00:35:54.018
SUPPORT FACILITY TODAY UNDER

00:35:54.085 --> 00:35:55.820
GOTTA PATHWAYS MORE AND MORE OF

00:35:55.887 --> 00:35:56.921
OUR FACILITIES HAVE INTEGRATED

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:59.156
PURPOSES AND WE THINK THAT MAKES

00:35:59.223 --> 00:36:01.192
SENSE -- TO FURTHER -- THE

00:36:01.259 --> 00:36:03.427
VISION FOR SUCCESS SO -- I THINK

00:36:03.494 --> 00:36:05.296
THESE WILL BUILD ON THESE WILL

00:36:05.363 --> 00:36:07.098
BE INCREMENTAL CHANGES TO THE

00:36:07.164 --> 00:36:09.800
EXISTING WAY IN WHICH WE

00:36:09.867 --> 00:36:11.235
ALLOCATE FACILITIES DOLLARS

00:36:11.302 --> 00:36:12.770
PRIOR TEST FACILITIES DOLLARS

00:36:12.837 --> 00:36:15.172
BUT CERTAINLY -- YOU KNOW IF YOU

00:36:15.239 --> 00:36:16.274
ALL WERE THE GOVERNOR GONNA USE

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:17.942
DIFFERENT CRITERIA THAT I THINK

00:36:18.009 --> 00:36:18.543
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE TO HAVE

00:36:18.609 --> 00:36:19.210
THAT.

00:36:19.277 --> 00:36:20.645
CONVERSATION WITH YOU SO WE ARE

00:36:20.711 --> 00:36:22.480
PERPETUATING -- THIS

00:36:22.547 --> 00:36:23.948
INCONSISTENCY BETWEEN WHAT WE

00:36:24.015 --> 00:36:24.916
PROPOSE AND WHAT THE

00:36:24.982 --> 00:36:26.551
ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE

00:36:26.617 --> 00:36:29.921
INCLUDED THE BUDGET WELL I THINK

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:30.755
I'LL BE LOOKING TO YOU.

00:36:30.821 --> 00:36:31.322
THE FOLKS AT THIS TABLE TO

00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:32.356
PROVIDE SOME SUGGESTIONS IN THAT

00:36:32.423 --> 00:36:34.225
REGARD I MEAN.

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:35.459
YOU ARE CERTAINLY THE EXPERTS

00:36:35.526 --> 00:36:36.694
AND DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

00:36:36.761 --> 00:36:38.729
CERTAINLY HAS A VARIETY OF

00:36:38.796 --> 00:36:40.398
THINGS ON THE PLATE THAT OF

00:36:40.464 --> 00:36:42.166
FINANCE HAS TO BALANCE INCLUDING

00:36:42.233 --> 00:36:43.200
DEBT SERVICE AND ALL THE REST

00:36:43.267 --> 00:36:44.969

NEW TIS FUTURE ACTION BUSINESS

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:47.939

PERHAPS HARDSHIP PERHAPS FAILURE

00:36:50.141 --> 00:36:51.876
TO PASS INABILITY TO PASS LOCAL

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:53.511

REASONS THAT BOND MEASURES

00:36:58.950 --> 00:37:01.218

HELLO.

00:39:52.356 --> 00:39:54.625
BOTH THE AWAY -- AND HAD A HAND

00:39:54.692 --> 00:39:55.726
ALL PUFFED UP IT'LL USE WITH

00:39:55.793 --> 00:39:56.894
KIND OF A SUBSET OF SOME OF

00:39:56.961 --> 00:39:58.929
INFORMATION WITHIN YOUR AGENDA --

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:00.264
USE -- AS THE BASIS FOR MY

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.866
PRESENTATION BUT ACTUALLY I'LL

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.901
SKIP OVER TO PAGE THREE ON OUR

00:40:03.968 --> 00:40:06.737

DON'T HAVE WE DON'T HAVE ANY

00:40:09.106 --> 00:40:10.374
CONCERNS WITH THE COMPONENTS THE

00:40:10.441 --> 00:40:12.076
ENROLLMENT GROWTH FUNDING IN THE

00:40:12.143 --> 00:40:13.978
IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WE'LL

00:40:14.044 --> 00:40:15.312

OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT.

00:40:16.714 --> 00:40:19.016
WANT TO TALK ABOUT -- TWO THINGS

00:40:19.083 --> 00:40:21.285
ONE IS -- ON AN EIGHTEEN

00:40:21.352 --> 00:40:22.586
NINETEEN APPORTIONMENT SHORTFALL --

00:40:22.653 --> 00:40:24.188
FOR THIS YEAR -- AND THEN I'LL

00:40:24.255 --> 00:40:25.055
TALK ABOUT SOME OF OUR

00:40:25.122 --> 00:40:26.290
ASSESSMENT AND RECOMMENDATIONS

00:40:26.357 --> 00:40:32.930
REGARDING SOME MODIFICATIONS TO

00:40:32.997 --> 00:40:35.232
THE FUNDING FORMULA.

00:40:35.299 --> 00:40:36.834
ON THE FIRST ARM IN ARM UNDER

00:40:36.901 --> 00:40:38.302
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ON THEIR

00:40:38.369 --> 00:40:39.970
RESPECTIVE SHORTFALL -- FOR

00:40:40.037 --> 00:40:41.405
PERFORMANCE IN -- IN THE CURRENT

00:40:41.472 --> 00:40:42.606
YEAR OF ESTIMATE IS SIXTY NINE

00:40:42.673 --> 00:40:43.374
MILLION SO THERE'S THERE'S NOT

00:40:43.440 --> 00:40:44.942
ENOUGH GENERAL FUND -- TO COVER

00:40:45.009 --> 00:40:45.509
THE FULL COST OF THE FUNDING

00:40:45.576 --> 00:40:46.744
FORMULA.

00:40:46.811 --> 00:40:47.444
AND THIS IS DRIVEN BY -- AND

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:50.114
HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED -- COSTS

00:40:50.181 --> 00:40:50.948
REGARDING THE STUDENTS ACROSS

00:40:51.015 --> 00:40:52.416
ALL OCCASION WHICH IS THE

00:40:52.483 --> 00:40:53.651
PORTION OF THE FORMULA BASED ON

00:40:53.717 --> 00:40:55.319
STUDENT OUTCOMES -- AND AND THIS

00:40:55.386 --> 00:40:56.854
THIS -- INCREASE I THINK IT'S

00:40:56.921 --> 00:40:58.155
PARTLY WHAT'S DRIVEN AND MANY OF

00:40:58.222 --> 00:40:59.290
THE PROPOSALS TO TRY T CAP --

00:40:59.356 --> 00:41:01.125
FUNDING AND TO LOOK AT THE DATA

00:41:01.192 --> 00:41:04.929
AND RELIABILITY OF THAT OF THAT

00:41:04.995 --> 00:41:07.498
DATA.

00:41:07.565 --> 00:41:08.432
THAT THE CHANCES OFFICE HAS AN

00:41:08.499 --> 00:41:10.267
AN ESTIMATE OF THE SHORTFALL

00:41:10.334 --> 00:41:11.535
THAT'S EVEN HIGHER THAT'S BASED

00:41:11.602 --> 00:41:13.838
ON THERE A PRELIMINARY WITH

00:41:13.904 --> 00:41:15.506
I'M LOOKING AT DATA AS OF THE

00:41:15.573 --> 00:41:17.508
END OF FEBRUARY -- THEIR FORMULA

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:18.475
FUNDING FROM THE COSTS ARE EVEN

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:19.844
HIGHER IT'S ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:41:19.910 --> 00:41:20.444
FORTY THREE MILLION ABOVE WITH

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:21.212
THOSE IN THE BUDGET.

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:21.812
AND THEN THEY ALSO PROJECT --

00:41:21.879 --> 00:41:24.315
LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED PROPERTY

00:41:24.381 --> 00:41:26.483
TAX REVENUES.

00:41:26.550 --> 00:41:27.218
I'M I THINK WE WE WE WERE JUST

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:28.185
POINT OUT ONE I THINK IN TERMS

00:41:28.252 --> 00:41:29.687
OF THE LOCAL PROPERTY TAX

00:41:29.753 --> 00:41:31.021
REVENUE WE WOULD SAY THAT -- THE

00:41:31.088 --> 00:41:32.189
THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT THAT HE

00:41:32.256 --> 00:41:32.857
WANTED THIS PART OF THE YEAR IS

00:41:32.923 --> 00:41:34.658
CONSISTENTLY UNDER REPORTED

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:36.427
DISTRICTS -- BOTH SCHOOL AND

00:41:36.493 --> 00:41:37.628
COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT ND

00:41:37.695 --> 00:41:39.163
TO UNDER REPORT FROM SPECIFIC

00:41:39.230 --> 00:41:40.831
REVENUES -- REDEVELOPMENT

00:41:40.898 --> 00:41:41.565
REVENUES AT YOU RIGHT FROM THE

00:41:41.632 --> 00:41:43.100
NEWS AND SO WE WOULD EXPECT THAT

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:44.802
THAT'S NOT AS MUCH OF AN ISSUE --

00:41:44.869 --> 00:41:46.003
WHEN YOU GET TO MAIN YOU GET

00:41:46.070 --> 00:41:47.872
UPDATED INFORMATION?

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.340
BUT THE THE HIGHER COSTS OF THE

00:41:49.406 --> 00:41:53.711
FUNDING FORMULA THE TEXAS

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:55.613
OFFICES USING THEM THE THE

00:41:55.679 --> 00:41:56.513
LATEST AVAILABLE DATA WE THINK

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.348
THAT'S AN ACCURATE REFLECTION OF

00:41:57.414 --> 00:41:58.983
OF A SHORTFALL YOU'LL HAVE IN IN

00:41:59.049 --> 00:42:00.084
THE CURRENT YEAR.

00:42:00.150 --> 00:42:01.318
THAT'S THE THREE HUNDRED MILLION.

00:42:01.385 --> 00:42:01.986
I AM WHAT WE THINK OF THE THREE

00:42:02.052 --> 00:42:03.888
IN A MILLION ABOUT A HUNDRED AND

00:42:03.954 --> 00:42:04.588
FORTY THREE MILLION IS

00:42:04.655 --> 00:42:05.556
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT THAT IS

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:06.457
HIGHER COSTS OF THE FORMULA.

00:42:06.523 --> 00:42:07.491
THAT WE THINK IS A REAL

00:42:07.558 --> 00:42:08.158
SHORTFALL YOU HAVE WHETHER IT'S

00:42:08.225 --> 00:42:08.826
MORE TO THREE HUNDRED MILLION WE

00:42:08.893 --> 00:42:10.794
THINK IT DEPENDS ON WHETHER THE

00:42:10.861 --> 00:42:12.930
PROPERTY TAX ISSUE IS REALLY --

00:42:12.997 --> 00:42:14.999
JUST THE UNDER REPORTING OF ONE

00:42:15.065 --> 00:42:16.667
POINT IN TIME OR WHETHER IT'S

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.202
REALLY IN A SYSTEMIC ISSUE.

00:42:18.269 --> 00:42:19.370
WITHIN THE HUNDRED FORTY THREE

00:42:19.436 --> 00:42:23.107
SERVE A MINIMUM THAT YOU SHOULD

00:42:23.173 --> 00:42:26.143
EXPECT THAT THAT WILL BE USEFUL.

00:42:26.210 --> 00:42:27.177
FOR JUST A COUPLE A COUPLE

00:42:27.244 --> 00:42:27.711
COMMENTS IN TERMS OF YOUR

00:42:27.778 --> 00:42:29.179
CONSIDERATION WE KNOW THAT THE

00:42:29.246 --> 00:42:30.180
ADMINISTRATION IS INDICATING

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:30.848
THAT THEY WILL WAIT TILL MADE TO

00:42:30.915 --> 00:42:31.715
FEEL REVENUES ARE BEFORE THEY

00:42:31.782 --> 00:42:32.449
DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT.

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.118
THEY WILL BACK FILL -- THE

00:42:34.184 --> 00:42:34.852
SHORTFALL.

00:42:34.919 --> 00:42:35.319
I'M.

00:42:35.386 --> 00:42:36.553
SORRY IT MIGHT BE ONE OF THE BIG

00:42:36.620 --> 00:42:38.689
DECISIONS YOU HAVE WHEN YOU GET --

00:42:38.756 --> 00:42:39.690
TO YOUR YOUR BUDGET BECAUSE THAT

00:42:39.757 --> 00:42:40.925
IS WHETHER OR NOT YOU WANT TO

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:41.525
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

00:42:41.592 --> 00:42:42.726
BACK FILL.

00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:44.194
I'M COVERING THE SHORTFALL DOES

00:42:44.261 --> 00:42:45.462
HELP SGNAL SUPPORT FOR THE NEW

00:42:45.529 --> 00:42:47.398
FUNDING FORMULA AND THE FOCUS ON

00:42:47.464 --> 00:42:49.066
IMPROVING STUDENT OUTCOMES IN

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:51.001
THE COMMITTEE CALL SYSTEM -- BUT

00:42:51.068 --> 00:42:52.736
IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE NOT TO

00:42:52.803 --> 00:42:53.971
COVER THE SHORTFALL THERE WILL

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:56.440
BE -- SOME ADJUSTMENT TO COMMUTE

00:42:56.507 --> 00:42:59.476
COLLEGE AMOUNT OF OF FUNDING

00:42:59.543 --> 00:43:00.945
FORMULA AMOUNT THAT THE RECEIVED

00:43:01.011 --> 00:43:01.645
YEAR.

00:43:01.712 --> 00:43:02.613
AND THAT THE CHANCES OF AS

00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.580
INDICATED THEY WOULD -- TRY TO

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.649
ASSURE THAT EVERY DISTRICT GOT

00:43:05.716 --> 00:43:06.951
AT LEAST WHAT THEY GOT LAST YEAR

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.320
PLUS COLA WHICH IS ALSO -- TIED

00:43:09.386 --> 00:43:09.820
TO WITH A HOLD HARMLESS

00:43:09.887 --> 00:43:11.055
PROVISION THAT THAT WAS INCLUDED

00:43:11.121 --> 00:43:13.157
IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET AS WE

00:43:13.223 --> 00:43:14.825
TRANSITION TO THE FORMULA.

00:43:14.892 --> 00:43:15.826
COLLEGES ARE -- DISTRICTS ARE

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:17.227
SUPPOSED TO BE RECEIVING AT THE

00:43:17.294 --> 00:43:19.029
BARE MINIMUM A SEVENTEEN

00:43:19.096 --> 00:43:20.130
EIGHTEEN PLUS COLA FOR THE FIRST

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:21.665
THREE YEARS OF PERIOD.

00:43:21.732 --> 00:43:22.900
I'M READING THAT SORT OF

00:43:22.967 --> 00:43:26.170
DIFFERENT THAT APPROACH -- FROM

00:43:26.236 --> 00:43:26.837
A PROJECT THAT THE FEW

00:43:26.904 --> 00:43:28.572
REASONABLE GIVEN THAT THERE ARE

00:43:28.639 --> 00:43:29.406
SOME DISTRICTS -- MY WHOLE ARE

00:43:29.473 --> 00:43:30.741
RECEIVING FOR EXAMPLE DOUBLE

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.508
DIGIT INCREASES UNDER THE NEW

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:32.776
FORMULA.

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:33.944
THOSE DISTRICTS MIGHT BE MORE

00:43:34.011 --> 00:43:35.546
EASILY ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE SOME

00:43:35.612 --> 00:43:37.014
OF THESE OPERATIONS IN THE

00:43:37.081 --> 00:43:38.048
MIDDLE OF THE YEAR BECAUSE MANY

00:43:38.115 --> 00:43:39.183
OF THEM DIDN'T KNOW THAT THEY

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:46.991
WERE GETTING.

00:43:47.057 --> 00:43:48.892
FUNDING WITH HIGH BECAUSE ALL OF

00:43:48.959 --> 00:43:50.928
THE THE THE THE LAST THE LAST

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:51.895
MINUTE CHANGES THERE ARE A LOT

00:43:51.962 --> 00:43:53.030
LIKE MACHINES THE FORMULA IT IS

00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:53.864
VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT LOOKED

00:43:53.931 --> 00:43:54.264
LIKE IN JANUARY.

00:43:54.331 --> 00:43:55.666
AND SO WE DON'T THINK A LOT OF

00:43:55.733 --> 00:43:56.834
COLLEGES REALLY EXPECTED THE M.

00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:58.168
AND BUDGETED FOR THE THINGS THAT

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.837
MIGHT BE MORE EASY EASIER FOR

00:43:59.903 --> 00:44:01.305
THEM TO ACCOMMODATE.

00:44:01.372 --> 00:44:02.072
I'M.

00:44:02.139 --> 00:44:04.208
THAT I WANT TO MOVE ON INTO THE

00:44:04.274 --> 00:44:05.242
OURS OF MEN OF FIVE THE

00:44:05.309 --> 00:44:07.244
PROPOSALS TO YOU -- CHANGE THE

00:44:07.311 --> 00:44:08.979
THE ACTUAL FORMULA ITSELF IN A

00:44:09.046 --> 00:44:10.547
MOVE TO PAGE.

00:44:10.614 --> 00:44:11.181
FIVE SO ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS

00:44:11.248 --> 00:44:11.749
WE DID WHEN WE HEARD OF THE

00:44:11.815 --> 00:44:12.683
PROPOSAL AND WE KNEW THAT IT WAS

00:44:12.750 --> 00:44:15.853
COMING FROM SOME CONCERNS ABOUT --

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:17.287
THE ISSUES WITH THE DATA AS IT --

00:44:17.354 --> 00:44:19.089
AND AND YOU KNOW THE EIGHTEEN

00:44:19.156 --> 00:44:20.824
NINETEEN BUDGET IS USING --

00:44:20.891 --> 00:44:22.593
WE'RE USING ONE YEAR DATA IN A

00:44:22.659 --> 00:44:23.527
REHEARSAL USING SEVENTEEN

00:44:23.594 --> 00:44:24.895
EIGHTEEN OUTCOMES DATA TO DECIDE

00:44:24.962 --> 00:44:25.863
HOW MUCH EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:44:25.929 --> 00:44:27.164
FUNDING -- DISTRICTS WILL

00:44:27.231 --> 00:44:28.899
RECEIVE THAT DATA CAME IN HIGHER

00:44:28.966 --> 00:44:30.467
THAN EXPECTED AND A BATTERY SOME

00:44:30.534 --> 00:44:31.602
CONCERNS ABOUT WHETHER THE STATE

00:44:31.668 --> 00:44:32.436
OUT THERE SOME ISSUES WITH THE

00:44:32.503 --> 00:44:33.470
DATA.

00:44:33.537 --> 00:44:34.071
SO WE WANTED TO LOOK BACK AND

00:44:34.138 --> 00:44:35.105
SAY IT SO IS THIS SOMETHING NEW

00:44:35.172 --> 00:44:36.073
IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S JUST

00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.107
STARTED TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE

00:44:37.174 --> 00:44:39.243
NEW FUNDING FORMULA OR IS THIS

00:44:39.309 --> 00:44:40.477
SOMETHING THAT IS SORT OF A

00:44:40.544 --> 00:44:42.446
INHERENT -- COMPONENT OF THE

00:44:42.513 --> 00:44:43.781
DATA SO THIS CHART THAT WE HAVE

00:44:43.847 --> 00:44:45.282
YOU ON PAGE FIVE SHOWS YOU THAT

00:44:45.349 --> 00:44:46.383
WE WENT BACK TEN YEARS AND LOOK

00:44:46.450 --> 00:44:46.583
THAT.

00:44:46.650 --> 00:44:47.785
THIS IS -- SPECIFICALLY

00:44:47.851 --> 00:44:49.887
ASSOCIATE DEGREES THOUGH WE IF

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:50.954
WE DID THE CHART FOR CERTIFICATE

00:44:51.021 --> 00:44:52.289
THAT WOULD LOOK ALMOST IT WOULD

00:44:52.356 --> 00:44:53.857
LOOK VERY SIMILAR.

00:44:53.924 --> 00:44:54.892
JUST LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE

00:44:54.958 --> 00:44:57.594
YEAR TO YEAR FLUCTUATIONS IN IN

00:44:57.661 --> 00:44:58.729
IN THESE AWARDS PER YEAR.

00:44:58.796 --> 00:45:00.898
AS YOU CAN SEE ON WE HAVE ONE

00:45:00.964 --> 00:45:01.465
LINE OF THE STATEWIDE LINE

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:02.599
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE STABLE

00:45:02.666 --> 00:45:04.134
THAN THE OTHERS BUT STILL CAN

00:45:04.201 --> 00:45:05.536
VERY ANYWHERE FROM.

00:45:05.602 --> 00:45:08.672
FROM 0% INCREASE 213% INCREASE

00:45:08.739 --> 00:45:09.673
PER YEAR.

00:45:09.740 --> 00:45:10.374
AND THEN WHEN YOU GO TO

00:45:10.441 --> 00:45:12.309
INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS WE CHOSE

00:45:12.376 --> 00:45:13.410
THREE RANDOM DISTRICT OF A

00:45:13.477 --> 00:45:15.345
BIGGER FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM JUST

00:45:15.412 --> 00:45:16.280
TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA.

00:45:16.346 --> 00:45:17.247
YOU CAN SEE PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:19.216
FLUCTUATION FROM YEAR TO YEAR IN

00:45:19.283 --> 00:45:21.085
TERMS OF THE THE THE OUTCOME SO.

00:45:21.151 --> 00:45:22.453
THIS DOES RAISE ISSUES OF IF

00:45:22.519 --> 00:45:23.720
THIS IS THE THE THE WAY WE'RE

00:45:23.787 --> 00:45:24.321
DISTRIBUTING FUNDING TO

00:45:24.388 --> 00:45:24.955
DISTRICTS.

00:45:25.022 --> 00:45:26.723
DO WE WANT TO CREATE THE

00:45:26.790 --> 00:45:28.192
UNCERTAINTY BOTH FOR THE STATE

00:45:28.258 --> 00:45:29.593
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.395
WHAT COSTS ARE BUT THEN ALSO FOR

00:45:31.462 --> 00:45:32.796
DISTRICT THEMSELVES DISTRICTS

00:45:32.863 --> 00:45:34.598
ART -- FROM THE INTENT OF THE

00:45:34.665 --> 00:45:35.332
NEW FUNDING FROM THE WAS TO

00:45:35.399 --> 00:45:37.167
CREATE GREATER INSTABILITY AND

00:45:37.234 --> 00:45:38.669
AND PREDICTABILITY IN FUNDING.

00:45:38.735 --> 00:45:40.504
OR DO KILL WEEDS WHAT WHAT

00:45:40.571 --> 00:45:42.206
CAUSES THIS THESE WIVES WHAT

00:45:42.272 --> 00:45:43.674
HAPPENS IS THAT WE DO SO WE DID

00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:45.509
TALK TO A FEW -- DISTRICTS TO

00:45:45.576 --> 00:45:46.610
GET A FENCE AND WE DON'T THINK

00:45:46.677 --> 00:45:47.744
WE CAN POINT PINPOINT WHAT'S NOT

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:49.313
BECAUSE THEY'RE THE NUMBER ONE

00:45:49.379 --> 00:45:50.114
CAUSE IN TERMS OF WEIGHT.

00:45:50.180 --> 00:45:50.814
BUT THEY WERE KIND OF THREE

00:45:50.881 --> 00:45:52.349
CATEGORIES OF OF REASONS WHY

00:45:52.416 --> 00:45:54.885
THIS THIS COULD BE THE CASE ONE

00:45:54.952 --> 00:45:57.020
IS THE DATE OF NOT ACCURATE --

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.989
BEFORE THE FUNDING FORMULA WAS

00:45:59.056 --> 00:46:01.058
ADOPTED THIS WAS SIMPLY LOW

00:46:01.125 --> 00:46:01.925
STAKES THE THAT'S NOT AUDITED BY

00:46:01.992 --> 00:46:02.893
AN EXTERNAL ENTITY OR WAS IT

00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.994
USED FOR ANY.

00:46:04.061 --> 00:46:05.262
FUNDING DECISION SO IT'S NOT

00:46:05.329 --> 00:46:06.797
SOMETHING THAT THERE'S BEEN A

00:46:06.864 --> 00:46:08.665
LOT OF SCRUTINY ON SIR COULD BE

00:46:08.732 --> 00:46:20.911
THAT THEY'RE JUST THE DATA IS

00:46:20.978 --> 00:46:23.680
JUST NOT AN ACTOR HISTORICALLY.

00:46:23.747 --> 00:46:25.449
IT COULD ALSO HAVE WE CHANGE

00:46:25.516 --> 00:46:26.250
THAT NOW.

00:46:26.316 --> 00:46:28.252
I THINK THE CHANCES OF IT ISN'T

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:29.887
IS IS GOING TO INCLUDE OUR THERE

00:46:29.953 --> 00:46:30.754
WILL BE AUDIT THEIR ANNUAL

00:46:30.821 --> 00:46:31.388
FINANCIAL AUDITS THE DISTRICTS

00:46:31.455 --> 00:46:31.922
MUST DO I MOVING FORWARD

00:46:31.989 --> 00:46:33.957
BEGINNING IN NINETEEN TWENTY MY

00:46:34.024 --> 00:46:34.591
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE WILL

00:46:34.658 --> 00:46:35.259
BE AN AUDIT.

00:46:35.325 --> 00:46:35.859
THAT DEBT THIS DATA WILL BE

00:46:35.926 --> 00:46:36.860
AUDITED OF PART OF THAT SO THAT

00:46:36.927 --> 00:46:41.598
SHOULD HELP ADDRESS SOME OF

00:46:41.665 --> 00:46:43.233
THOSE CONCERNS WELL.

00:46:43.300 --> 00:46:44.301
UNLESS THE AUDIT.

00:46:44.368 --> 00:46:45.536
REFLECTS THAT THE DATA IS

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:46.737
ACCURATE AND WE HAVE THESE WIDE

00:46:46.803 --> 00:46:47.771
SWINGS AND THEN SO MY QUESTION

00:46:47.838 --> 00:46:48.672
MY FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS THAT I

00:46:48.739 --> 00:46:50.140
GUESS IT PROBABLY SHOULDN'T GO

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:51.708
TO YOU BUT I'LL.

00:46:51.775 --> 00:46:54.611
YOU FREAKING SO OUR ADDRESS YEAH.

00:46:54.678 --> 00:46:55.379
WHAT ADDITIONAL DATA POINTS WHAT

00:46:55.445 --> 00:46:59.283
ADDITIONAL IT'S I THINK THE

00:46:59.349 --> 00:47:00.117
CHANCELLOR'S ALSO HIRED A

00:47:00.184 --> 00:47:01.185
FIGMENT TO DO A REVIEW THIS

00:47:01.251 --> 00:47:03.287
SPRING OF OF OF A RANDOM SAMPLE

00:47:03.353 --> 00:47:04.655
OF DISTRICT AND ALL LET THEM

00:47:04.721 --> 00:47:05.522
TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:47:05.589 --> 00:47:06.156
LATER?

00:47:06.223 --> 00:47:06.823
BUT YOU ARE ALSO HELPING SET UP

00:47:06.890 --> 00:47:08.892
MY POINTS THAT I WANTED TO TALK

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:11.929
ABOUT WHAT IS THE BEST YES IS

00:47:11.995 --> 00:47:13.230
THAT IS SUCH THAT YOU.

00:47:13.297 --> 00:47:13.864
I APPRECIATE THAT.

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:14.431
SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OTHER

00:47:14.498 --> 00:47:15.165
THINGS THAT WE HEARD FROM

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:16.700
COLLEGES ARE POSSIBLE REASONS

00:47:16.767 --> 00:47:18.135
ONE IS JUST SOMETIMES THERE'S

00:47:18.202 --> 00:47:19.503
LAGS INWINDOWS REPORTED SO FOR

00:47:19.570 --> 00:47:21.438
EXAMPLE -- IT MIGHT BE THAT

00:47:21.505 --> 00:47:23.173
TYPICALLY A DISTRICT IS

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:23.874
PROCESSING THEIR ASSOCIATE

00:47:23.941 --> 00:47:24.942
DEGREES IN MAY AND JUNE OF A

00:47:25.008 --> 00:47:26.109
FISCAL YEAR.

00:47:26.176 --> 00:47:27.077
AND WHEN YOU'RE FOR WHATEVER

00:47:27.144 --> 00:47:32.916
REASON THERE'S A LAG THEY DON'T

00:47:32.983 --> 00:47:33.450
GET TO THEM UNTIL JULY AND

00:47:33.517 --> 00:47:34.551
AUGUST.

00:47:34.618 --> 00:47:35.352
THE MONTH OR TWO MONTH DELAY

00:47:35.419 --> 00:47:36.420
MAYBE FOR A STUDENT DOESN'T MEAN

00:47:36.486 --> 00:47:37.154
MUCH. FOR THE PROGRAM DOESN'T

00:47:37.221 --> 00:47:38.121
MEAN ANYTHING BUT FROM OUR

00:47:38.188 --> 00:47:38.989
PERSPECTIVE INTO THE DATA IT

00:47:39.056 --> 00:47:40.624
LOOKS LIKE YOU DROP ONE YEAR AND

00:47:40.691 --> 00:47:41.425
THEN YOU CAME BACK UP ANOTHER.

00:47:41.491 --> 00:47:42.025
SO IT COULD BE THAT THERE ARE

00:47:42.092 --> 00:47:42.759
SOME OF THESE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:47:42.826 --> 00:47:43.694
ISSUES THAT ARE MAKING THE STATE

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.861
A LOOK THE WAY IT IS.

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:45.495
AND THEN THE OTHER ISSUE IS THAT

00:47:45.562 --> 00:47:47.030
SOMETIMES ARE JUST LOCAL

00:47:47.097 --> 00:47:48.632
DIFFERENCES IN WHAT'S GOING ON

00:47:48.699 --> 00:47:51.001
SO FOR EXAMPLE YOU MIGHT IMAGINE.

00:47:51.068 --> 00:47:52.569
YOU'RE IN A COLLEGE IN A IN AN

00:47:52.636 --> 00:47:56.340
AREA THAT'S HAD IMPROVEMENTS OR

00:47:56.406 --> 00:47:57.874
OR PROBLEMS IN THEIR RECORD AND

00:47:57.941 --> 00:47:58.909
ECONOMICALLY AND THAT MIGHT

00:47:58.976 --> 00:47:59.910
AFFECT THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS TO

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:01.211
ENTER THE SYSTEM SO YOU MIGHT

00:48:01.278 --> 00:48:02.446
HAVE A BIGGER COHORT OF STUDENTS

00:48:02.512 --> 00:48:03.513
WHEN YOU'RE.

00:48:03.580 --> 00:48:04.281
IN A SMALLER COVER DISTANT THE

00:48:04.348 --> 00:48:06.316
NEXT THAT MIGHT AFFECT HOW WHAT

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:07.050
YOU SEE AS AL COMES DOWN THE

00:48:07.117 --> 00:48:08.318
ROAD.

00:48:08.385 --> 00:48:09.820
YOU ALSO COULD IMAGINE THAT IF I

00:48:09.886 --> 00:48:11.922
FOR EXAMPLE CS YOU MIGHT CHANGE

00:48:11.989 --> 00:48:12.923
ITS POLICIES ON TRANSFERS MIGHT

00:48:12.990 --> 00:48:14.558
DECIDE THAT THEY'RE GOING.

00:48:14.625 --> 00:48:15.425
TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF

00:48:15.492 --> 00:48:16.460
TRANSFER STUDENTS THAT THEY

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:17.894
ADMIT.

00:48:17.961 --> 00:48:18.762
THAT'S GOING TO THEM THAT MIGHT

00:48:18.829 --> 00:48:19.863
RESULT IN NEIGHBORING COLLEGES

00:48:19.930 --> 00:48:21.632
HAVING TRANSFER NUMBERS GO UP

00:48:21.698 --> 00:48:23.000
THESE ARE ISSUES THESE ARE REAL

00:48:23.066 --> 00:48:24.434
CHANGES AND SO IT'S IT'S

00:48:24.501 --> 00:48:26.203
FLUCTUATING BUT IT'S BASED ON

00:48:26.270 --> 00:48:27.604
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING OUT IN

00:48:27.671 --> 00:48:28.772
THE IN THE IN THE WORLD.

00:48:28.839 --> 00:48:29.373
WELL YEAH I WOULD BET THAT IF

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:35.746
IT'S IF IT'S BUREAUCRATIC --

00:48:35.812 --> 00:48:37.948
UNCERTAINTY OR LACK OF SPEED THE

00:48:38.015 --> 00:48:39.616
MONEY FLOW WILL PROBABLY TEND TO

00:48:39.683 --> 00:48:41.418
SPEED THAT UP YEAH THAT COULD BE

00:48:41.485 --> 00:48:42.152
ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT I THINK

00:48:42.219 --> 00:48:43.820
THAT POTENTIALLY COULD BE IT

00:48:43.887 --> 00:48:44.921
COULD BE A WAY TO ADDRESS THAT

00:48:44.988 --> 00:48:45.355
I'M.

00:48:45.422 --> 00:48:46.823
SO OUR RECOMMENDATIONS ON WE

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:47.658
HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE

00:48:47.724 --> 00:48:49.226
TH SHE WON RELATED TO THIS

00:48:49.293 --> 00:48:51.061
POSITION WE DO THINK THAT THE

00:48:51.128 --> 00:48:52.462
THE STEPS TO THE CHANCELLOR'S

00:48:52.529 --> 00:48:54.464
OFFICE IS TAKING -- TOO INCLUDE

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:55.766
AUDIT GUIDELINES AROUND THIS

00:48:55.832 --> 00:48:56.967
DATA AND TRAFFIC NOT TO REVIEW

00:48:57.034 --> 00:48:58.135
AND MAKE SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

00:48:58.201 --> 00:48:59.202
FOR HOW THE PROCESS CAN IMPROVE

00:48:59.269 --> 00:49:01.438
WILL IMPROVE THE DATA ACCURACY I

00:49:01.505 --> 00:49:02.506
THINK IT WILL HELP US FEEL MORE

00:49:02.572 --> 00:49:03.106
COMFORTABLE AT THE DATA WE'RE

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:04.241
GETTING IS.

00:49:04.308 --> 00:49:05.342
WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THE

00:49:05.409 --> 00:49:06.209
FIELD BUT WE DON'T KNOW THAT

00:49:06.276 --> 00:49:08.178
THAT NECESSARILY WILL DEAL WITH

00:49:08.245 --> 00:49:09.279
THE FACT THAT DETECT THE STATE A

00:49:09.346 --> 00:49:10.480
COMPLEX RATE AND SO WHAT WE

00:49:10.547 --> 00:49:12.716
RECOMMEND IS THAT THE DISTANCE

00:49:12.783 --> 00:49:13.317
OF VALIDATION BECAUSE CREATED

00:49:13.383 --> 00:49:14.551
USING A THREE YEAR ROLLING

00:49:14.618 --> 00:49:15.819
AVERAGE AS OPPOSED TO WHEN

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:16.953
YOU'RE OUT OF TIME.

00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:17.854
SO THAT THAT PROVIDES A LITTLE

00:49:17.921 --> 00:49:18.955
BIT OF A SMOOTHING EFFECT SO YOU

00:49:19.022 --> 00:49:20.590
DON'T HAVE THESE WILD SWINGS UP

00:49:20.657 --> 00:49:21.591
AND DOWN.

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:22.292
OR EVEN IF YOU DO FROM YEAR TO

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:24.695
YEAR THAT IT'S NOT REFLECTED IN

00:49:24.761 --> 00:49:27.264
THE AMOUNTS THAT WERE IS

00:49:27.331 --> 00:49:28.432
DISTURBING TO DISTRICTS.

00:49:28.498 --> 00:49:29.800
THE THE NEXT RECOMMENDATION THAT

00:49:29.866 --> 00:49:30.434
WE HAVE IS THAT YOU RELATED TO

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:31.234
THE CAP SO WE RECOMMEND

00:49:31.301 --> 00:49:33.737
REJECTING THE PROPOSAL TO CAP

00:49:33.804 --> 00:49:35.572
THE THE THE STUDENTS ACROSS

00:49:35.639 --> 00:49:37.641
ALLOCATION AT 10% GROWTH PER

00:49:37.708 --> 00:49:38.475
YEAR.

00:49:38.542 --> 00:49:39.509
OUR CONCERN THERE IS THAT THERE

00:49:39.576 --> 00:49:40.811
ARE SOME DISTRICTS THAT MIGHT BE

00:49:40.877 --> 00:49:41.411
GROWING AT THAT RATE BECAUSE

00:49:41.478 --> 00:49:42.045
THEY'RE ACTUALLY MAKING GENUINE

00:49:42.112 --> 00:49:43.647
IMPROVEMENT THAT WE DON'T WANT.

00:49:43.714 --> 00:49:45.582
TO DISCOURAGE THAT -- SO WHAT WE

00:49:45.649 --> 00:49:46.550
RECOMMEND IS THAT THE

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:47.884
LEGISLATURE EXPLORE OTHER

00:49:47.951 --> 00:49:49.052
ALTERNATIVES FOR COST

00:49:49.119 --> 00:49:51.988
CONTAINMENT THAT THAT -- WOULD

00:49:52.055 --> 00:49:52.923
NOT NECESSARILY REMOVE THE

00:49:52.989 --> 00:49:54.224
STRONG INCENTIVE FOR SOME

00:49:54.291 --> 00:49:55.792
DISTRICTS SO THERE ARE A NUMBER

00:49:55.859 --> 00:49:57.060
OF DIFFERENT THINGS APPROACHES

00:49:57.127 --> 00:49:58.528
YOU COULD TAKE THEIR ONE

00:49:58.595 --> 00:49:59.196
SPECIFIC THING THAT WE RECOMMEND

00:49:59.262 --> 00:50:01.064
IS -- LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF

00:50:01.131 --> 00:50:02.199
OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING THAT'S

00:50:02.265 --> 00:50:03.834
GENERATED BY ANY INDIVIDUAL

00:50:03.900 --> 00:50:05.902
STUDENT IN ANY PARTICULAR YEAR

00:50:05.969 --> 00:50:07.537
TO THE HIGHEST DEGREE EARNED

00:50:07.604 --> 00:50:09.272
SUFFER OR THE HIGHEST ORDERED SO

00:50:09.339 --> 00:50:11.375
FOR EXAMPLE YOU EARNED. TWO

00:50:11.441 --> 00:50:12.342
ASSOCIATES DEGREES IN A

00:50:12.409 --> 00:50:12.976
CERTIFICATE IN A YEAR WE WOULD

00:50:13.043 --> 00:50:14.478
JUST GIVE YOU FUNDING FOR ONE OF

00:50:14.544 --> 00:50:15.112
THE ASSOCIATE DEGREES

00:50:15.178 --> 00:50:16.713
I MEAN THE IDEA THERE IS THAT WE

00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.815
DON'T WANT COLLEGES TO TO JUST

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:21.418
START SORT OF FINDING STUDENTS

00:50:21.485 --> 00:50:22.619
WE KNOW ALREADY GONNA GET TO THE

00:50:22.686 --> 00:50:23.887
SYSTEM AND JUST FINDING NEW

00:50:23.954 --> 00:50:24.788
CERTIFICATE THE NEW DEGREES TO

00:50:24.855 --> 00:50:26.256
ADD. TO IT TO INCREASE FUNDING

00:50:26.323 --> 00:50:26.923
THAT'S NOT KIND OF THE INTENT OF

00:50:26.990 --> 00:50:28.558
THE FORMULA WE WANT TO BE

00:50:28.625 --> 00:50:30.327
REWARDING -- DISTRICTS THAT ARE

00:50:30.394 --> 00:50:31.661
GETTING MORE STUDENTS TO

00:50:31.728 --> 00:50:32.963
COMPLETE WITH WITH EITHER A

00:50:33.029 --> 00:50:44.508
DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE SO WE

00:50:44.574 --> 00:50:45.075
THINK THIS WOULD HELP REDUCE

00:50:45.142 --> 00:50:46.943
BECAUSE IN A WAY THAT STILL

00:50:47.010 --> 00:50:48.879
ENCOURAGES STUDENT ODD COLLEGES

00:50:48.945 --> 00:50:50.614
TO INCREASED IN THREE TH -- TO

00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:53.617
THOSE OF THE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS

00:50:53.683 --> 00:50:54.217
THAT WE HAVE AND I'M HAPPY TO

00:50:54.284 --> 00:50:56.853
ANSWER THE QUESTION. TOO MANY

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.121
COLLEGES OF LIKE TO INTERESTED

00:50:58.188 --> 00:50:59.322
IN YOUR COMMENT ON THE LA AS

00:50:59.389 --> 00:51:01.124
RECOMMENDATIONS AND AND ALSO

00:51:01.191 --> 00:51:03.126
WHEN WILL WE HAVE DATA.

00:51:03.193 --> 00:51:04.494
THAT IS ACCURATE.

00:51:04.561 --> 00:51:05.195
ON WHICH TO BASE SOME FINAL

00:51:05.262 --> 00:51:05.796
DECISIONS ON WHAT THE FINAL

00:51:05.862 --> 00:51:07.197
VERSION OF THIS.

00:51:07.264 --> 00:51:08.532
STUDENT SUCCESS FUNDING PLAN

00:51:08.598 --> 00:51:10.801
LOOKS LIKE HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE.

00:51:10.867 --> 00:51:12.202
TO COLLECT DATA TO DETERMINE.

00:51:12.269 --> 00:51:13.503
HOWARD WHAT WHAT'S GOING ON AND

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:14.304
WHO WERE GONNA HURT BY DOING

00:51:14.371 --> 00:51:16.006
WHAT WE DO AND SO WE HAVE DATA

00:51:16.072 --> 00:51:17.040
TODAY WE FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:18.375
WE'RE USING THE SEVENTEEN

00:51:18.442 --> 00:51:19.709
EIGHTEEN OF THE STATUTE SAYS TO

00:51:19.776 --> 00:51:21.445
YOU SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN CAL'S OF

00:51:21.511 --> 00:51:22.879
BOTH THE LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND

00:51:22.946 --> 00:51:23.680
WHAT WE'RE CALLING THE

00:51:23.747 --> 00:51:24.014
SUPPLEMENTAL.

00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:26.016
ALLOCATION AND THEN THE OUTCOMES

00:51:26.082 --> 00:51:28.285
AND THE STUDENTS XSL CATION I

00:51:28.351 --> 00:51:29.319
THINK THE CONCERN THAT'S BEEN

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:31.955
RAISED IN THE BUDGET IS -- THAT

00:51:32.022 --> 00:51:32.856
DATA.

00:51:32.923 --> 00:51:35.325
SUBMITTED AS PART OF OUR NORMAL --

00:51:35.392 --> 00:51:36.626
ANNUAL REPORTING PROCESS SEES

00:51:36.693 --> 00:51:38.195
NOW HAS A NEW LEVEL OF

00:51:38.261 --> 00:51:39.796
SIGNIFICANCE OF THAT IT DIDN'T

00:51:39.863 --> 00:51:42.399
BEFORE AND IS THAT DATA --

00:51:42.466 --> 00:51:44.367
ACCURATE AND SO I THINK WHAT

00:51:44.434 --> 00:51:46.002
WERE SO WE'VE SAID IS THAT'S AN

00:51:46.069 --> 00:51:47.571
IMPORTANT QUESTION THE ANSWER WE

00:51:47.637 --> 00:51:49.105
ASKED THE FISCAL CRISIS

00:51:49.172 --> 00:51:50.474
MANAGEMENT ASSISTANT ASSISTANCE

00:51:50.540 --> 00:51:52.742
TEAM TO PRODUCE A REPORT TO DO A

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.511
REVIEW OF A SAMPLE OF DISTRICTS --

00:51:54.578 --> 00:51:56.179
INTO PRODUCER REPORT FOR US AND

00:51:56.246 --> 00:51:57.280
SO WE'LL HAVE THAT REPORT IN

00:51:57.347 --> 00:51:59.483
EARLY MAY THAT -- HOPEFULLY CAN

00:51:59.549 --> 00:52:01.518
INFORM OUR FINAL DELIBERATIONS --

00:52:01.585 --> 00:52:05.355
TO THE DISTRICTS HAVE THE

00:52:05.422 --> 00:52:07.023
OPPORTUNITY TO SUBMIT.

00:52:07.090 --> 00:52:08.325
TO CORRECTED DATA WE HAVE -- WE

00:52:08.391 --> 00:52:09.192
HAVE WE GAVE DISTRICTS THE

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:10.126
OPPORTUNITY THIS YEAR TO SUBMIT

00:52:10.193 --> 00:52:12.729
A CORRECTED DATA -- FOR

00:52:12.796 --> 00:52:13.263
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN MOVING

00:52:13.330 --> 00:52:15.899
FORWARD -- PART OF THAT FAKE MAD --

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.767
CHARGES TO COME UP WITH SOME

00:52:17.834 --> 00:52:19.135
PROTOCOLS THAT WE SHOULD PUT IN

00:52:19.202 --> 00:52:21.471
PLACE I WOULD EXPECT THAT ISSUES --

00:52:21.538 --> 00:52:22.572
LIKE THAT.

00:52:22.639 --> 00:52:23.807
OKAY AND THEN WE HAVE THE THREE

00:52:23.874 --> 00:52:26.076
YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE ISSUE AND

00:52:26.142 --> 00:52:28.378
THEN WE HAVE THE WHAT I WILL

00:52:28.445 --> 00:52:29.713
CALL THE LABELING ON OF

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:30.714
ASSOCIATE DEGREES AND

00:52:30.780 --> 00:52:32.349
CERTIFICATES AS PART OF THE

00:52:32.415 --> 00:52:34.417
FUNDING MECHANISM.

00:52:34.484 --> 00:52:35.919
THOUGHT SHOULD I WALK THROUGH I

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:37.721
CAN WALK THROUGH -- AND AND I

00:52:37.787 --> 00:52:39.689
THINK I MAY ADDRESS SOME OF IT

00:52:39.756 --> 00:52:42.092
THOUGH I WILL BE SAYING IT.

00:52:42.158 --> 00:52:44.594
I ALSO THINK -- THESE SAME

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:45.161
THINGS OTHERS HAVE SAID IN

00:52:45.228 --> 00:52:45.962
DIFFERENT WAYS SO I WILL DO THAT

00:52:46.029 --> 00:52:47.264
QUICKLY BUT I'M WORKING THROUGH

00:52:47.330 --> 00:52:49.266
THIS PACKET -- AND I'M STARTING

00:52:49.332 --> 00:52:51.902
ON PAGE.

00:52:51.968 --> 00:52:57.374
TWO THE PART THAT I JUST -- YES --

00:52:57.440 --> 00:52:59.843
THE PART THAT I WANT TO MAKE

00:52:59.910 --> 00:53:01.811
SURE THAT.

00:53:01.878 --> 00:53:04.748
WE COVER IS THAT -- YOU KNOW

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.449
WHAT WHY DID WE DO THIS IN THE

00:53:06.516 --> 00:53:08.184
FIRST PLACE AND I THINK WE AS

00:53:08.251 --> 00:53:08.885
THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY

00:53:08.952 --> 00:53:11.187
COLLEGES HAD THREE GOALS ONE TO

00:53:11.254 --> 00:53:12.522
ENCOURAGE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:13.757
VISION FOR SUCCESS.

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:15.458
ESPECIALLY CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT

00:53:15.525 --> 00:53:17.627
GAPS -- FOR THOSE GROUPS WHO

00:53:17.694 --> 00:53:18.094
HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:20.430
MARGINALIZED A SECOND TO VERY

00:53:20.497 --> 00:53:22.232
EXPLICITLY PROVIDE DISTRICTS

00:53:22.299 --> 00:53:23.767
SERVING HIGHER NUMBERS OF LOW

00:53:23.833 --> 00:53:25.402
INCOME STUDENTS WITH ADDITIONAL

00:53:25.468 --> 00:53:26.536
FUNDING.

00:53:26.603 --> 00:53:28.238
AND THEN THIRD TO MAKE BEANS --

00:53:28.305 --> 00:53:31.241
DISTRICTS TO MAKE FUNDING TO

00:53:31.308 --> 00:53:32.242
DISTRICTS.

00:53:32.309 --> 00:53:34.611
MOST USEFUL BEST ABLE TO SUPPORT

00:53:34.678 --> 00:53:35.712
THAT -- IMPROVEMENTS TO ASTON

00:53:35.779 --> 00:53:37.914
SUCCESS BY MAKING THEM STABLE

00:53:37.981 --> 00:53:39.382
PREDICTABLE AND FLEXIBLE.

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:41.251
AND SO THE YOU KNOW THE PART OF

00:53:41.318 --> 00:53:43.153
THIS AND I'M GOING TO THE BOTTOM

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:44.588
OF THE SLIDE OF PAGE.

00:53:44.654 --> 00:53:46.056
TWO IS THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY

00:53:46.122 --> 00:53:48.625
IT IS A IN SOME WAYS VERY SIMPLE

00:53:48.692 --> 00:53:50.026
FORMULA WE ARE COUNTING THE

00:53:50.093 --> 00:53:51.127
NUMBER.

00:53:51.194 --> 00:53:53.396
OF FACTORS A VARIETY OF THINGS

00:53:53.463 --> 00:53:54.664
THAT WE ARE COUNTING.

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:56.166
AND WE ARE NOW MULTIPLYING THEM

00:53:56.232 --> 00:53:58.301
BY A RATE THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:53:58.368 --> 00:54:00.337
PUT INTO -- THE LAW THE RATES

00:54:00.403 --> 00:54:02.939
WERE DESIGNED SO THAT ABOUT 70%

00:54:03.006 --> 00:54:03.773
OF THE MONEY IN THE FIRST YEAR

00:54:03.840 --> 00:54:05.575
WOULD GO TO THE ENROLLMENT BASE

00:54:05.642 --> 00:54:07.043
THE BASE ALLOCATION.

00:54:07.110 --> 00:54:09.846
ABOUT A 20% WOULD GO TO THE

00:54:09.913 --> 00:54:10.914
ALLOCATION THE SUPPLEMENTAL

00:54:10.981 --> 00:54:11.815
ALLOCATION FOR LOW INCOME

00:54:11.881 --> 00:54:16.019
STUDENTS ABOUT 10% FOR THE FOR

00:54:16.086 --> 00:54:18.088
THE STUDENTS XSL OCCASION -- I

00:54:18.154 --> 00:54:19.189
THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO

00:54:19.255 --> 00:54:20.924
KNOW THAT YOU SET THE THE RATES

00:54:20.991 --> 00:54:22.492
OF THE STATUTE THE PROPOSAL THIS

00:54:22.559 --> 00:54:25.061
YEAR IS TO CHANGE THOSE RATES.

00:54:25.128 --> 00:54:26.563
I'M MOVING OUT OF PAGE THREE ONE

00:54:26.630 --> 00:54:28.698
OF THE THINGS -- WE HAVEN'T

00:54:28.765 --> 00:54:30.734
TALKED AS MUCH ABOUT TODAY IS

00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:32.135
THE PROVISIONS AROUND FUNDING

00:54:32.202 --> 00:54:33.470
STABILITY THAT WERE INCLUDED

00:54:33.536 --> 00:54:35.205
THESE ARE OFTEN CALLED THE HOLD

00:54:35.271 --> 00:54:35.939
HARMLESS.

00:54:36.006 --> 00:54:38.508
SO FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:39.242
WHAT WE ARE.

00:54:39.309 --> 00:54:41.144
ACTUALLY APPORTIONING TO

00:54:41.211 --> 00:54:43.179
DISTRICTS IS EITHER THE AMOUNT

00:54:43.246 --> 00:54:45.382
THAT THE FORMULA CALCULATED. FOR

00:54:45.448 --> 00:54:48.118
WHAT THEY RECEIVED IN TWENTY

00:54:48.184 --> 00:54:51.454
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN ADJUSTED BY A

00:54:51.521 --> 00:54:52.722
CHANGE IN THE COST OF LIVING.

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:55.058
IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY WE HAD

00:54:55.125 --> 00:54:55.959
A THIRD -- PROVISION RELATED TO

00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:59.295
STABILITY THAT SAYS IF YOUR

00:54:59.362 --> 00:54:59.929
TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FUNDING

00:54:59.996 --> 00:55:01.464
FORMULA CALCULATION WAS HIGHER

00:55:01.531 --> 00:55:02.799
WE WILL GIVE YOU WHAT YOU GOT --

00:55:02.866 --> 00:55:05.402
WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IN TWENTY

00:55:05.468 --> 00:55:05.969
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN TO PROVIDE

00:55:06.036 --> 00:55:06.770
YOUR GEAR STABILITY.

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:07.671
AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM

00:55:07.737 --> 00:55:09.039
OF PAGE THREE WHEN WE THINK

00:55:09.105 --> 00:55:10.473
ABOUT HOW FUNDS ARE DISTRIBUTED

00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.409
UNDER THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA.

00:55:12.475 --> 00:55:14.544
YOU'LL SEE MOST OF THE MONEY.

00:55:14.611 --> 00:55:16.379
VERY SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE

00:55:16.446 --> 00:55:16.913
MONEY CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.381
STATUTE IS GOING TO THE BASE

00:55:18.448 --> 00:55:20.350
ALLOCATION OF MORE THAN FIVE

00:55:20.417 --> 00:55:21.718
BILLION DOLLARS.

00:55:21.785 --> 00:55:23.753
ABOUT A YOU KNOW ONE POINT FIVE

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.055
BILLION DOLLARS IS GOING TO THE

00:55:25.121 --> 00:55:26.623
SUPPLEMENTAL LOCATION LESS THAN

00:55:26.690 --> 00:55:27.657
A BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

00:55:27.724 --> 00:55:29.225
STUDENT SUCCESS.

00:55:29.292 --> 00:55:30.794
WITH A SMALL AMOUNT IS NECESSARY

00:55:30.860 --> 00:55:32.295
TO MAKE SURE THAT DISTRICTS ARE

00:55:32.362 --> 00:55:34.230
BEING HELD HARMLESS.

00:55:34.297 --> 00:55:35.331
THE OTHER PART THAT I'M MOVING

00:55:35.398 --> 00:55:37.534
TO PAGE FOR THAT -- WE HAVEN'T

00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:39.169
TALKED AS MUCH ABOUT IS THAT --

00:55:39.235 --> 00:55:40.103
YOU KNOW THINKING.

00:55:40.170 --> 00:55:41.204
WORKING WITH FINANCIAL

00:55:41.271 --> 00:55:42.806
INCENTIVES IS COMPLICATED --

00:55:42.872 --> 00:55:45.942
THERE IS A POTENTIAL -- FOR YOU

00:55:46.009 --> 00:55:47.744
KNOW UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES YOU

00:55:47.811 --> 00:55:49.045
KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.347
STATUTE LAST YEAR ENACTED -- WAS

00:55:51.414 --> 00:55:53.349
A SET OF PROVISIONS THAT WERE

00:55:53.416 --> 00:55:55.952
INTENDED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:55:56.019 --> 00:55:57.253
THE WORK DISTRICTS WERE DOING ON

00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.888
THEIR BUDGET WAS ALIGNED WITH

00:55:58.955 --> 00:56:00.156
THE GOALS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN

00:56:00.223 --> 00:56:01.591
THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO THE

00:56:01.658 --> 00:56:03.827
STATUTE REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO

00:56:03.893 --> 00:56:04.761
ADOPT GOALS.

00:56:04.828 --> 00:56:05.662
THAT ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE

00:56:05.729 --> 00:56:06.996
STATE'S GOALS OF IMPROVING

00:56:07.063 --> 00:56:08.665
OUTCOMES IN CLOSING ACHIEVEMENT

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:09.532
GAPS.

00:56:09.599 --> 00:56:11.634
THEN TO ALIGN THEIR LOCAL PLANS

00:56:11.701 --> 00:56:13.536
FOR HOW THEY'RE SPENDING MONEY --

00:56:13.603 --> 00:56:15.038
WITH THOSE GOALS AND ALIGNING

00:56:15.105 --> 00:56:16.506
THEIR BUDGETS WITH THOSE PLANS

00:56:16.573 --> 00:56:18.641
SO I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS

00:56:18.708 --> 00:56:20.210
THAT WE ARE HOPING -- YOU KNOW

00:56:20.276 --> 00:56:22.145
HAPPENS MOVING FORWARD IN A

00:56:22.212 --> 00:56:23.213
PLACE WHERE OUR OFFICE NEEDS TO

00:56:23.279 --> 00:56:25.315
PLAY AS A ROLE IS SUPPORTING

00:56:25.381 --> 00:56:27.650
DISTRICTS HAVING CONVERSATIONS

00:56:27.717 --> 00:56:30.620
ABOUT HOW DO YOU BEST MEET THE

00:56:30.687 --> 00:56:31.921
THE INCENTIVES THE FINANCIAL

00:56:31.988 --> 00:56:35.325
INCENTIVES THAT ARE CREATED IN

00:56:35.391 --> 00:56:35.792
THE FUNDING FORMULA.

00:56:35.859 --> 00:56:37.293
DOING SO IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS

00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:38.361
THE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING

00:56:38.428 --> 00:56:39.529
THAT THE WORD THAT YOUR STUDENTS

00:56:39.596 --> 00:56:42.132
NEED -- TO TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES.

00:56:42.198 --> 00:56:45.802
I WILL SKIP OVER -- TO PAGE FIVE

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:47.470
THAN I DID TALK THROUGH SO I'M

00:56:47.537 --> 00:56:48.905
LOOKING AT THE SIDE THAT SAYS

00:56:48.972 --> 00:56:50.373
CONSIDERATION OF US -- FUNDING

00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:52.809
FORMULA MODIFICATIONS SCF

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:54.611
MODIFICATIONS.

00:56:54.677 --> 00:56:55.979
AND SO TO YOUR POINT MR CHER YOU

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.347
KNOW WE ARE SPENDING A LOT OF

00:56:57.413 --> 00:56:58.782
TIME WITH THE WORK GROUP -- THAT

00:56:58.848 --> 00:57:00.350
INCLUDE SYSTEM STAKEHOLDERS TO

00:57:00.416 --> 00:57:01.351
WORK THROUGH THE GOVERNOR'S

00:57:01.417 --> 00:57:03.720
PROPOSALS AND TO WORK THROUGH

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:05.321
THE ALLEY -- ALTERNATIVES AND

00:57:05.388 --> 00:57:06.356
OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT HAVE

00:57:06.422 --> 00:57:08.625
COME UP -- FROM OTHER SYSTEM

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.393
STAKEHOLDERS.

00:57:10.460 --> 00:57:11.694
THE LIST IS IN YOUR AGENDA OF

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.797
THE FULL LIST OF QUESTIONS THAT

00:57:13.863 --> 00:57:15.732
WE ARE -- CONSIDERING AND ON

00:57:15.799 --> 00:57:17.167
THIS SLIDE I'VE I'VE BROKEN THEM

00:57:17.233 --> 00:57:19.702
UP INTO TWO CATEGORIES ONE IS.

00:57:19.769 --> 00:57:21.571
KIND OF STRUCTURAL ISSUES

00:57:21.638 --> 00:57:23.706
GENERALLY -- WHAT TYPES OF

00:57:23.773 --> 00:57:24.707
CONSTRAINTS SHOULD WE PUT ALL

00:57:24.774 --> 00:57:26.509
THE FORMULA SHOULD WE PUT ON A

00:57:26.576 --> 00:57:28.344
YEAR OVER YEAR -- CAP ON THE

00:57:28.411 --> 00:57:29.779
STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION I

00:57:29.846 --> 00:57:31.781
THINK WE SHARE SIMILAR CONCERNS

00:57:31.848 --> 00:57:32.949
IN THE ALLEY -- RAISED ABOUT

00:57:33.016 --> 00:57:34.584
THAT PARTICULAR CAP BUT I THINK

00:57:34.651 --> 00:57:35.785
WE ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S

00:57:35.852 --> 00:57:37.453
IMPORTANT FOR THE FOR THE

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:38.822
FORMULA TO BE FINANCIALLY

00:57:38.888 --> 00:57:41.591
SUSTAINABLE THAT THERE'S LIMITS

00:57:41.658 --> 00:57:45.028
ON HOW MUCH THE COST WOULD GROW

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:46.596
YEAR FOR YEAR.

00:57:46.663 --> 00:57:47.997
UP WE AGREED WITH THE LA THOSE

00:57:48.064 --> 00:57:49.899
CONCERNS ABOUT THE FLUCTUATION

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:51.768
AND DATA PARTICULARLY FOR THE

00:57:51.835 --> 00:57:53.336
STUDENT SUCCESS ALLOCATION AND

00:57:53.403 --> 00:57:54.871
HOW MUCH THAT CHANGES YOUR FOR

00:57:54.938 --> 00:57:57.540
YOUR WE THINK IT'S REASONABLE.

00:57:57.607 --> 00:57:59.442
TO USE SOME TYPE OF AVERAGE OF

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:01.077
DATA OVER MULTIPLE YEARS IT'S

00:58:01.144 --> 00:58:02.445
WHAT WE DID IN THE SPACE

00:58:02.512 --> 00:58:04.080
ALLOCATION ON THE ENROLLMENT

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.148
SIDE OF THE FORMULA WHERE WE

00:58:05.215 --> 00:58:07.217
SAID. FOR A FOR A MOMENT FOR

00:58:07.283 --> 00:58:09.185
FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS

00:58:09.252 --> 00:58:10.820
WORKING ACCOUNT USING A THREE

00:58:10.887 --> 00:58:12.355
YEAR CALCULATION THAT LOOKS AT

00:58:12.422 --> 00:58:15.792
THREE YEARS OF ENROLLMENT TO

00:58:15.859 --> 00:58:18.027
DETERMINE THE LEVEL OF FUNDING --

00:58:18.094 --> 00:58:19.863
AND THEN ON THE STUDENT SUCCESS

00:58:19.929 --> 00:58:21.130
ALLOCATION -- A CORE ISSUE THAT

00:58:21.197 --> 00:58:22.765
RE RAISED -- LAST YEAR WAS THIS

00:58:22.832 --> 00:58:24.300
KILLING OF AWARDS FIRST IS

00:58:24.367 --> 00:58:26.269
COUNTING OF STUDENTS AND SO I

00:58:26.336 --> 00:58:30.206
THINK IN GENERAL WE AGREE WITH --

00:58:30.273 --> 00:58:31.441
YOU KNOW THE THE THE ALLEY OWES

00:58:31.507 --> 00:58:32.976
RECOMMENDATION THAT WE SHOULD BE

00:58:33.042 --> 00:58:35.111
COUNTING SOMETHING LIKE THE

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:36.713
HIGHEST AWARD THAT A STUDENT

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.748
EARNS IN A GIVEN YEAR -- IN

00:58:38.815 --> 00:58:40.884
ORDER -- TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:58:40.950 --> 00:58:43.553
FOCUS REMAINS ON GUIDED PATHWAYS

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:44.687
THAT LEAD A STUDENT TO BE

00:58:44.754 --> 00:58:50.660
TO THE

00:58:50.727 --> 00:58:52.161
FOR BOB THERE ARE FEW OTHER --

00:58:52.228 --> 00:58:52.929
ISSUES THE GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY

00:58:52.996 --> 00:58:55.565
HAS A PROPOSAL TO KILL TRANSFER

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:57.066
STUDENTS DIFFERENTLY TO HELP

00:58:57.133 --> 00:58:58.801
THIS TRANSFER STUDENT ONCE.

00:58:58.868 --> 00:59:00.603
IN THE DISTRICT WHERE THEY LIVE

00:59:00.670 --> 00:59:01.638
ONE OF THE CONCERNS WE'VE HAD

00:59:01.704 --> 00:59:03.139
ABOUT THAT PROPOSAL AND THAT

00:59:03.206 --> 00:59:04.574
HAVE BEEN RAISED OR STAKEHOLDER

00:59:04.641 --> 00:59:06.209

NO DOUBT IT'S A IT MAKES ME

01:00:30.059 --> 01:00:32.195
REALIZE -- MANY PEOPLE COULD --

LAST ATTENDED.

01:00:40.536 --> 01:00:42.105
OR THOUGHT SOME THRESHOLD THAT

01:00:42.171 --> 01:00:43.506
SAYS WILL KILL THE STUDENT AT

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.274
ANY DISTRICT WITH A STUDENT AT

01:01:08.364 --> 01:01:10.166
THAT THE DATA IS VALID AND

01:01:10.233 --> 01:01:11.968
RELIABLE -- WE PASS THE FAKE NOT

KNOW WITH ONLINE STUDIES I WORRY

01:09:26.395 --> 01:09:28.430
A LITTLE BIT ABOUT STUDENTS JUST

01:09:28.497 --> 01:09:30.299
BEING BEHIND THE SCREEN.

01:09:30.366 --> 01:09:31.534
HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE

01:09:31.600 --> 01:09:34.236
THEY'RE ABLE TO SOCIALLY ENGAGE --

01:09:34.303 --> 01:09:36.372

YEAH AND THAT'LL YOU KNOW --

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:42.278
AFTER MY LIFE AFTER I SOLD MY

01:09:42.344 --> 01:09:44.446
LAST COMPANY AT THE END OF

01:09:44.513 --> 01:09:44.980
TWENTY FIFTEEN I ENDED UP

01:09:45.047 --> 01:09:45.848
WORKING WITH THE BILL MELINDA

01:09:45.915 --> 01:09:47.650
GATES FOUNDATION FOR A COUPLE OF

01:09:47.716 --> 01:09:50.019
YEARS -- AND I RAN A PORTFOLIO

01:09:50.085 --> 01:09:51.353
THAT INVESTED IN DEVELOPMENTAL

01:09:51.420 --> 01:09:54.290
EDUCATION DIGITAL LEARNING --

01:09:54.356 --> 01:09:56.725
ADVISING -- FINANCIAL SECURITY

01:09:56.792 --> 01:09:59.028
ETCETERA -- AND WHAT WE'VE

01:09:59.094 --> 01:10:00.195
LEARNED THROUGH STUDY AFTER

01:10:00.262 --> 01:10:01.997
STUDY WHICH HAVE ALREADY KNOWN

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:05.000
BUT BUT REALLY -- REINFORCED --

01:10:05.067 --> 01:10:06.068
THIS INFORMATION THAT PEOPLE WHO

01:10:06.135 --> 01:10:08.103
TYPICALLY DIDN'T DO WELL IN

01:10:08.170 --> 01:10:09.572
TRADITIONAL EDUCATION.

01:10:09.638 --> 01:10:11.707
DO NOT PERFORM WELL ON A PURELY

01:10:11.774 --> 01:10:13.208
ONLINE EXPERIENCE.

01:10:13.275 --> 01:10:15.511
SO WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS USE

01:10:15.578 --> 01:10:17.780
TECHNOLOGY. FOR WHAT IT DOES

01:10:17.846 --> 01:10:20.249
BEST WHICH IS TO DELIVER.

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:22.184
REAL TIME IN A FLEXIBLE WAY WHEN

01:10:22.251 --> 01:10:24.486
PEOPLE NEED IT WHENEVER THAT IS.

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:25.888
THE RIGHT CONTENT THAT THEY CAN

01:10:25.955 --> 01:10:29.024
REVIEW AND MASTER AND COMPLETE

01:10:29.091 --> 01:10:30.626
THEIR ASSESSMENTS ONLINE FOR

01:10:30.693 --> 01:10:33.295
EXAMPLE BUT IT MAY BE THAT

01:10:33.362 --> 01:10:34.530
SOMEBODY -- EVEN.

01:10:34.597 --> 01:10:36.165
THROUGH THEIR MOBILE DEVICE GETS

01:10:36.231 --> 01:10:38.200
THE RIGHT CONTENT TO TAKE YOU

01:10:38.267 --> 01:10:42.271
KNOW LEARN THE NEXT THING

01:10:42.338 --> 01:10:43.305
QUICKLY AND EASILY.

01:10:43.372 --> 01:10:44.173
BUT THAT IS NOT A SUBSTITUTE FOR

01:10:44.239 --> 01:10:45.574
FOLKS HAVING APPLIED LEARNING

01:10:45.641 --> 01:10:47.776
EXPERIENCES ON THE JOB WHICH IS

01:10:47.843 --> 01:10:49.211
WHY PAID WORK EXPERIENCE

01:10:49.278 --> 01:10:51.180
EXPERIENCE OR APPRENTICESHIP IS

01:10:51.246 --> 01:10:52.581
CRITICAL TO OUR MODEL.

01:10:52.648 --> 01:10:54.650
AND ADDITIONALLY WHY WE NEED TO

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.285
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SUCCESS

01:10:56.352 --> 01:10:57.586
SUPPORTS ONCE THEY'RE EVEN

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.188
PLACED INTO THE JOB BECAUSE A

01:10:59.254 --> 01:11:00.289
LOT OF FOLKS IF THIS IS THE

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:02.191
FIRST TIME THEY'VE BEEN IN THIS

01:11:02.257 --> 01:11:03.525
KIND OF WORK ENVIRONMENT NEED.

01:11:03.592 --> 01:11:05.060
ONGOING COACHING AND OTHER

01:11:05.127 --> 01:11:06.462
SUPPORTS.

01:11:06.528 --> 01:11:10.799
AND AND AND SO I I WOULD

01:11:10.866 --> 01:11:12.968
ACTUALLY CALL IT MORE ACCURATELY

01:11:13.035 --> 01:11:14.670
A BLENDED LEARNING EXPERIENCE

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.538
WHICH MEANS ONLINE PLUS IN

01:11:16.605 --> 01:11:19.174
PERSON THE ALSO THE FOLKS WERE

01:11:19.241 --> 01:11:21.310
SERVING -- TYPICALLY DON'T HAVE

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.879
NETWORKS THEY GET THEM INTO

01:11:23.946 --> 01:11:25.314
GETTING INTERVIEWED ARE

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:27.383
CONSIDERED FOR JOBS EVEN -- AND

01:11:27.449 --> 01:11:28.951

ACTUALLY WE GET OUR JOBS TO

01:11:32.655 --> 01:11:33.155
REFER ALL FROM FRIENDS AND

01:11:33.222 --> 01:11:34.256
FAMILY.

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:35.224
SO IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT

01:11:35.290 --> 01:11:36.392
NETWORK IT'S KIND OF CHICKEN AND

01:11:36.458 --> 01:11:38.961

01:12:37.886 --> 01:12:39.455
MENTIONED -- AND IS THERE A

01:12:39.521 --> 01:12:41.690
SINGLE POINT OF CONTACT IN THE

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:44.526
IN REGIONS OR COMMUNITIES.

01:12:44.593 --> 01:12:46.295
IS IT THE SAME CONTACT THAT YOU

01:12:46.361 --> 01:12:47.896
GO TO IS THAT THE WORKFORCE

01:12:47.963 --> 01:12:49.998
DEVELOPMENT BOARD REGIONALLY FOR

01:12:50.065 --> 01:12:53.569
EXAMPLE -- I'M I'M INTERESTED

01:12:53.635 --> 01:12:56.105
BECAUSE YOU KNOW FRANKLY I THINK

01:12:56.171 --> 01:12:57.573
WE FACE THE SAME ISSUES.

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:59.375
WHEN WE START TALKING ABOUT THE

01:12:59.441 --> 01:13:01.310
THE CONSORTIUM THAT WE HAVE

01:13:01.376 --> 01:13:01.844
AROUND THE STATE THAT ARE

01:13:01.910 --> 01:13:07.082
DEALING WITH -- CTP -- IT'S THE

01:13:07.149 --> 01:13:11.653
A CRITICAL ISSUE AND AS I

01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:14.056
LEARNED BACK WHEN I LAUNCHED SF

01:13:14.123 --> 01:13:15.824
WORKS IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES

01:13:15.891 --> 01:13:18.660
AS A RESPONSE TO WELFARE REFORM.

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.797
AND FOCUSING ON HARD SKILLS --

01:13:21.864 --> 01:13:23.465
THE DEVELOPMENT AND TRAINING AND

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:25.000
DELIVERY OF HARD SKILLS TO GET

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:26.902
PEOPLE OFF WELFARE INTO LIVING

01:13:26.969 --> 01:13:29.271
WAGE JOBS WHAT I LEARNED AT THAT

01:13:29.338 --> 01:13:30.606
POINT IN TIME IN ROCKEFELLER

01:13:30.672 --> 01:13:32.508
READY CASE STUDY ABOUT ON THIS

01:13:32.574 --> 01:13:34.543
MODEL WHICH IS THAT YOU HAVE TO

01:13:34.610 --> 01:13:36.945
WORK WITH EMPLOYERS AND SPECIFIC

01:13:37.012 --> 01:13:38.480
SHOPS ON THE FRONT END.

01:13:38.547 --> 01:13:39.815
BECAUSE EMPLOYERS DON'T HAVE

01:13:39.882 --> 01:13:42.451
CONFIDENCE OR EVEN KNOWLEDGE OF

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.385
WHAT.

01:13:43.452 --> 01:13:44.953
COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:46.355
EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:48.190
OTHERS ARE DOING TO REALLY

01:13:48.257 --> 01:13:50.192
PREPARE THEM FOR THEIR JOBS THEY

01:13:50.259 --> 01:13:52.027
JUST DON'T HAVE CONFIDENCE.

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:54.530
IN KNOWING THAT -- PEOPLE HAVE

01:13:54.596 --> 01:13:56.465
CERTAIN KINDS OF THEY DON'T EVEN

01:13:56.532 --> 01:13:58.000
KNOW WHAT A LETTER GRADE FROM

01:13:58.066 --> 01:13:59.334
ONE INSTITUTION TO ANOTHER

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:00.769
REALLY REPRESENTS ENOUGH THE

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.938
FORM OF THIS PERSON BEING READY

01:14:03.005 --> 01:14:03.605
FOR THEIR JOB.

01:14:03.672 --> 01:14:04.506
SO.

01:14:04.573 --> 01:14:06.809
THAT REALLY BE GETS -- THE FACT

01:14:06.875 --> 01:14:08.377
THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE EMPLOYERS

01:14:08.443 --> 01:14:10.512
WITH THE JOBS WHERE THEY CAN'T

01:14:10.579 --> 01:14:12.548
FIND ENOUGH SKILLED PEOPLE AND

01:14:12.614 --> 01:14:13.782
RETAIN THEM.

01:14:13.849 --> 01:14:16.518
ON AND THEY NEED -- TO WORK WITH

01:14:16.585 --> 01:14:18.620
A PLAYER LIKE US TO SUPPLY AND

01:14:18.687 --> 01:14:20.556
FILL THE NEEDS THAT THEY CAN'T

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:21.523
SEEM TO FILL.

01:14:21.590 --> 01:14:24.026
IT'S IT'S NOT EASY.

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:26.595
BUT IT IS I THINK N IMPERATIVE

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.363
THIS IS THE ONLY WAY THAT I KNOW

01:14:28.430 --> 01:14:29.298
HOW TO MAKE IT WORK.

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:32.801
AND WHAT I WILL SAY IS THAT --

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:36.972
MANY OF OUR COMPANIES -- IN --

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.473
IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA ARE AWARE

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:39.708
OF THE FACT THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:14:39.775 --> 01:14:42.344
ABLE TO FIND AND RETAIN THE

01:14:42.411 --> 01:14:43.679
RIGHT TALENT.

01:14:43.745 --> 01:14:45.080
ALL LONG ENOUGH AND

01:14:45.147 --> 01:14:46.315
UNFORTUNATELY A LOT OF THOSE

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:47.482
COMPANIES ALTHOUGH THEY'RE

01:14:47.549 --> 01:14:48.517
SITTING ON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS

01:14:48.584 --> 01:14:51.353
CASH DON'T NECESSARILY INVESTED

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:52.921
INTO CALIFORNIANS.

01:14:52.988 --> 01:14:55.290
OFTENTIMES THEY OUTSOURCE THOSE

01:14:55.357 --> 01:14:56.625
JOBS THE OTHER PLACES.

01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:58.460
SO EVEN IN OUR FIRST TRAINING

01:14:58.527 --> 01:15:01.830
PROGRAM IT'S A VERY INTERESTING --

01:15:01.897 --> 01:15:03.365
CASE STUDY BECAUSE MEDICAL

01:15:03.432 --> 01:15:06.034
CODING IS A VERY WELL PAYING JOB

01:15:06.101 --> 01:15:06.768
TODAY.

01:15:06.835 --> 01:15:07.803
BUT A LOT OF THOSE JOBS ARE

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:09.605
BEING OUTSOURCED TO INDIA AND

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:10.839
OTHER COUNTRIES.

01:15:10.906 --> 01:15:13.075
AND A LOT OFTHOSE JOBS -- WILL

01:15:13.141 --> 01:15:15.077
ALSO BECOE OBSOLETE IN THE NEXT

01:15:15.143 --> 01:15:17.479
DECADES BECAUSE MEDICAL CODING

01:15:17.546 --> 01:15:18.947
WHICH IS LABOR INTENSIVE NOW

01:15:19.014 --> 01:15:21.950
WILL BE HANDLED BY A I AND A LOT

01:15:22.017 --> 01:15:23.218
OF NEW TECHNOLOGY.

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:25.988
SO I NEED TO USE THAT AS AN INCH

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:28.190
IN ILLUSTRATION.

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.558
AND A POINT WITH OUR LAWYER

01:15:29.625 --> 01:15:31.126
ADULT LEARNERS BUT IT IS YOUR

01:15:31.193 --> 01:15:32.828
ENTRYWAY INTO THE HEALTH CARE

01:15:32.895 --> 01:15:33.929
PATHWAY.

01:15:33.996 --> 01:15:35.397
IT IS THE BEGINNING OF YOUR

01:15:35.464 --> 01:15:37.733
CAREER PATH IT'S NOT THE FINAL

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:39.001
DESTINATION.

01:15:39.067 --> 01:15:41.436
ALL WE KNOW FROM STUDIES TODAY.

01:15:41.503 --> 01:15:43.672
THAT THE AVERAGE EMPLOYEE TODAY

01:15:43.739 --> 01:15:45.474
WHO'S AROUND THE AGE OF YOU KNOW

01:15:45.540 --> 01:15:48.677
EARLY TWENTIES WILL HAVE

01:15:48.744 --> 01:15:49.978
SEVENTEEN JOBS IN FIVE DIFFERENT

01:15:50.045 --> 01:15:51.313
SECTORS OF INDUSTRY THROUGHOUT

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.247
THEIR CAREER.

01:15:52.314 --> 01:15:54.383
SO THAT MEANS LIKE MY MOTHER HAD

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:56.952
ONE JOB WORKING FOR THE IRS FOR

01:15:57.019 --> 01:15:57.552
THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND IT WAS

01:15:57.619 --> 01:15:59.521
LITERALLY THE SAME JOB FOR

01:15:59.588 --> 01:16:00.188
THIRTY FIVE YEARS.

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:03.458
AND I LIKE TO SAY I'VE HAD

01:16:03.525 --> 01:16:04.593
PROBABLY THIRTY FIVE JOBS.

01:16:04.660 --> 01:16:05.160
AND IT'S A REALLY DIFFERENT

01:16:05.227 --> 01:16:06.595
WORLD WE LIVE IN NOW AND YOU CAN

01:16:06.662 --> 01:16:08.363
CALL THE GIG ECONOMY CAUGHT THIS

01:16:08.430 --> 01:16:09.398
OR THAT.

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:10.866
WHAT I FOUND IS A LOT OF

01:16:10.933 --> 01:16:12.901
EMPLOYERS FEEL LIKE HAT MAY BE

01:16:12.968 --> 01:16:15.537
A WAY OF -- TAKING A PASS ON

01:16:15.604 --> 01:16:17.773
INVESTING IN OUR WORK FORCE AND

01:16:17.839 --> 01:16:19.474
WHAT'S HAPPENING IS INCREASINGLY

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.209
MORE PEOPLE ARE GETTING

01:16:21.276 --> 01:16:23.211
DISCONNECTED FROM FULL TIME

01:16:23.278 --> 01:16:25.447
EMPLOYMENT WITH BENEFITS.

01:16:25.514 --> 01:16:26.715
IT'S LIVING WAGE SHOULD WEAR

01:16:26.782 --> 01:16:28.784
THAT ALLOWS FOR THEM TO THRIVE

01:16:28.850 --> 01:16:30.319
AND SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES.

01:16:30.385 --> 01:16:32.521
AND SO WE REALLY I THINK HAVE TO

01:16:32.587 --> 01:16:33.522
IMPRESS UPON THE BUSINESS

01:16:33.588 --> 01:16:35.524
COMMUNITY.

01:16:35.590 --> 01:16:36.258
AND I DO HAVE A STRATEGY FOR

01:16:36.325 --> 01:16:39.294
THAT -- THAT GETS THEM TO INVEST

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:41.196
IN OUR PEOPLE AND OUR ADULT

01:16:41.263 --> 01:16:44.266
WORKERS AND AND INVESTING IN

01:16:44.333 --> 01:16:46.668
THEM TO DO BE ABLE TO TO NEW

01:16:46.735 --> 01:16:48.637
JOBS THAT THEY'VE JUST CREATED --

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:50.973
IN THE WAY THAT WE DO THAT IS I

01:16:51.039 --> 01:16:53.175
THINK WE MAKE A BUSINESS CASE.

01:16:53.241 --> 01:16:54.710
SO RECENTLY ACCENTURE DID A

01:16:54.776 --> 01:16:56.979
RETURN ON INVESTMENT STUDY FOR

01:16:57.045 --> 01:16:59.114
THE COMPANY DISCOVER WHICH IS A

01:16:59.181 --> 01:17:00.782
FINANCIAL.

01:17:00.849 --> 01:17:02.718
CARD CREDIT CARD.

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:03.552
AND THEY FOUND THAT WHEN

01:17:03.618 --> 01:17:05.520
DISCOVER WAS WILLING TO PAY FOR

01:17:05.587 --> 01:17:07.756
PEOPLE'S ONGOING EDUCATION.

01:17:07.823 --> 01:17:09.558
THEY HAD BETTER RETENTION AND

01:17:09.624 --> 01:17:10.692
LOYALTY FROM THEIR EMPLOYEES

01:17:10.759 --> 01:17:12.361
THEY ALSO HAD EMPLOYEE

01:17:12.427 --> 01:17:14.062
SATISFACTION IMPROVE.

01:17:14.129 --> 01:17:15.831
THERE ARE MANY DIFFERENT CASES

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.099
TO BE MADE AND WE'RE RIGHT NOW

01:17:17.165 --> 01:17:18.633

THAT SORT OF ON A STATEWIDE

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:38.787
BASIS SO WE HAVE CONSISTENCY.

01:22:38.853 --> 01:22:40.889
YOU KNOW FROM CHICO DECEMBER TO

01:22:40.955 --> 01:22:42.424
DENOTE TUNED.

01:22:42.490 --> 01:22:45.393
IRVINE TO SAN DIEGO AND AN

01:22:45.460 --> 01:22:48.229
EMPLOYER WITH ONE SITE WERE

01:22:48.296 --> 01:22:49.030
TWENTY FIVE SITES IN THE STATE

01:22:49.097 --> 01:22:51.199
WOULD KNOW. TO GO TO THIS

01:22:51.266 --> 01:22:53.034
PARTICULAR GROUP AND SAY.

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:56.171
I CAN'T FIND AN X. Y. Z..

01:22:56.237 --> 01:22:58.073
AND I'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE OF THAT

01:22:58.139 --> 01:22:59.307
I NEED.

01:22:59.374 --> 01:23:01.710

COULD THEN PASS IT TO YOU PASS

01:23:03.978 --> 01:23:06.448
IT TO THE EDUCATIONAL CONSORTIA.

01:23:06.514 --> 01:23:08.416
AND WE COULD BEGIN TO MEET JOB

01:23:08.483 --> 01:23:10.418
NEEDS ON A MORE ORGANIZED BASIS

01:23:10.485 --> 01:23:11.519
I THINK AT LEAST THAT'S MY

01:23:11.586 --> 01:23:13.521
PERCEPTION IN THE STATE OF

01:23:13.588 --> 01:23:15.523
CALIFORNIA IS THAT DOABLE.

01:23:15.590 --> 01:23:17.125
THAT IS DOABLE GENERAL RIGHT AND

01:23:17.192 --> 01:23:18.426
I THINK THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL --

01:23:18.493 --> 01:23:19.994
VISION AS WELL I THINK IT'S SO

01:23:20.061 --> 01:23:22.430
IMPORTANT WHAT I'VE SEEN AGAIN

01:23:22.497 --> 01:23:24.432
THROUGH SOME OF MY RESEARCH EVEN

01:23:24.499 --> 01:23:26.968
IN STATES WHERE -- THE LABOR

01:23:27.035 --> 01:23:29.137
INFORMATION IS MORE READILY

01:23:29.204 --> 01:23:30.839
AVAILABLE TO THE EDUCATIONAL

01:23:30.905 --> 01:23:33.808
COMMUNITY -- THERE'S A HUGE LAG

01:23:33.875 --> 01:23:35.944
BETWEEN -- WHAT EMPLOYERS ARE

01:23:36.010 --> 01:23:37.979
DOING REAL TIME CREATING NEW

01:23:38.046 --> 01:23:43.718
JOBS THAT HAVE NEW COMPETENCIES

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:44.719
ATTACHED TO THEM?

01:23:44.786 --> 01:23:45.820
AND HOW IT GETS ACTUALLY

01:23:45.887 --> 01:23:47.389
PUBLISHED OR ORGANIZED IN A

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:49.124
DATABASE WHICH IS USUALLY TWO OR

01:23:49.190 --> 01:23:50.191
THREE YEARS OUT OF TOUCH BY THE

01:23:50.258 --> 01:23:52.026
TIME IT'S ACTUALLY UPDATED.

01:23:52.093 --> 01:23:53.194
AND THEN WHEN IT HOW DOES IT

01:23:53.261 --> 01:23:54.696
MEAN WHEN DOES IT GET TRANSLATED

01:23:54.763 --> 01:23:56.131
TO SOME KIND OF INSTRUCTION

01:23:56.197 --> 01:23:57.399
SYSTEM.

01:23:57.465 --> 01:23:59.267
WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE ETHER AND

01:23:59.334 --> 01:24:02.036
SO THE SYSTEM IS UNFORTUNATELY --

01:24:02.103 --> 01:24:03.905
UNDER DEVELOPED RIGHT NOW AND I

01:24:03.972 --> 01:24:05.840
THINK THAT WITH TODAY'S

01:24:05.907 --> 01:24:07.876
TECHNOLOGIES ESPECIALLY.

01:24:07.942 --> 01:24:09.010
WELL THERE ARE LOTS OF EMERGING

01:24:09.077 --> 01:24:11.146
TECHNOLOGIES BUT WE HAVE A WAY

01:24:11.212 --> 01:24:12.781
WHERE WE COULD ACTUALLY PUT THAT

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:13.882
ONLINE.

01:24:13.948 --> 01:24:16.217
AND TAKE TAKE THE WITH THE OTHER

01:24:16.284 --> 01:24:17.719
BENEFITS OF MEDITATED TAKE THAT

01:24:17.786 --> 01:24:19.421
THAT INFORMATION AND MAKE IT

01:24:19.487 --> 01:24:21.723
AVAILABLE TO PEOPLE --

01:24:21.790 --> 01:24:23.224
THROUGHOUT THE STATE REAL TIME

01:24:23.291 --> 01:24:24.259
AND I THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE A

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:26.728
HUGE CONTRIBUTION TO THE ENTIRE

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:28.997
WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY

01:24:29.063 --> 01:24:30.231
BECAUSE I WAS READING IT FOR YOU.

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.800
I WAS READING IT THE LOGISTICS

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:34.202
INDUSTRY AND AND INLAND SOUTHERN

01:24:34.269 --> 01:24:40.308
CALIFORNIA THAT NEEDS.

01:24:40.375 --> 01:24:40.942
TWENTY TWENTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES

01:24:41.009 --> 01:24:43.611
I'VE TRIED OTHER GOOD JOB BUT I

01:24:43.678 --> 01:24:44.245
THOUGHT WELL WHAT IS WHAT DOES

01:24:44.312 --> 01:24:44.546
THAT MEAN.

01:24:44.612 --> 01:24:45.914
WHAT WHAT WHAT KIND DO YOU DO

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:46.581
WHAT YOU KNOW WHAT TYPES OF JOBS

01:24:46.648 --> 01:24:47.449
WHAT JOBS SKILLS ARE REQUIRED

01:24:47.515 --> 01:24:49.217
FOR THE?

01:24:49.284 --> 01:24:49.818
TWENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN IT

01:24:49.884 --> 01:24:51.886
IT'S IT'S IT'S TWENTY THOUSAND

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:52.954
FOOT DATA.

01:24:53.021 --> 01:24:54.556
BUT THAT'S NOT HOW YOU PLAN AN

01:24:54.622 --> 01:24:56.191
EDUCATIONAL THAT'S RIGHT.

01:24:56.257 --> 01:24:57.492

IN THE SENSE THIS PROGRAM IS

INTENDED TO SERVE AS AN

01:28:17.392 --> 01:28:20.128
INCENTIVE FOR COLLEGES CAN PROOF

01:28:20.194 --> 01:28:23.231
CAN SUPPORT.

01:28:23.297 --> 01:28:24.198
FINANCE TO SHED THE GOVERNOR IS

01:28:24.265 --> 01:28:25.199
PROPOSING TO AUGMENT FUNDING FOR

01:28:25.266 --> 01:28:26.467
THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE

01:28:26.534 --> 01:28:27.735
PROGRAM.

NEED.

01:28:32.373 --> 01:28:33.941
OUR OFFICE DOES HAVE A NUMBER OF

01:28:34.008 --> 01:28:35.276
CONSENSUS PROPOSAL.

01:28:35.343 --> 01:28:37.612
WHICH ARE LISTED ON PAGE

01:28:37.679 --> 01:28:38.913
EIGHTEEN OF YOUR CONTACT.

01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:41.582
TOWARD THE BOTTOM.

01:28:41.649 --> 01:28:43.051
THE FIRST OF OUR THREE CONCERNS

01:28:43.117 --> 01:28:46.320
IS LARGELY A MATTER OF TIMING.

01:28:46.387 --> 01:28:47.522
BECAUSE THE STATE FIRST FUNDED

01:28:47.588 --> 01:28:50.224
THIS PROGRAM IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:28:50.291 --> 01:28:51.693
NINETEEN IT'S TO SEND TOO SOON

01:28:51.759 --> 01:28:52.427
TO VALIDATE THE OUTCOMES

01:28:52.493 --> 01:28:54.395
UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT IT'S HAD

01:28:54.462 --> 01:28:55.063
ON COLLEGE ENROLLMENT

01:28:55.129 --> 01:28:57.932
FINANCIALLY PARTICIPATION AND

01:28:57.999 --> 01:28:59.434
SKIP OUTCOMES.

01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:00.735
AND WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:01.669
THINK IT MAY BE PREMATURE TO

01:29:01.736 --> 01:29:03.237
EXPAND THE PROGRAM AND NEARLY

01:29:03.304 --> 01:29:05.973
DOUBLED FUNDING.

01:29:06.040 --> 01:29:08.109
OUR SECOND CONCERN IS MRE

01:29:08.176 --> 01:29:10.111
DISTRIBUTIONAL NATURE.

01:29:10.178 --> 01:29:11.345
AS THE SUBCOMMITTEE KNOWS WELL

01:29:11.412 --> 01:29:13.081
THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF

01:29:13.147 --> 01:29:15.049
UNMET FINANCIAL NEED RIGHT NOW

01:29:15.116 --> 01:29:16.651
AMONG COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS.

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:18.252
PARTICULARLY WHEN IT COMES TO

01:29:18.319 --> 01:29:20.021
NON TUITION COSTS WHICH ARE OF

01:29:20.088 --> 01:29:21.122
COURSE NOT COVERED BY THE BOARD

01:29:21.189 --> 01:29:23.491
OF GOVERNORS WHO EVER.

01:29:23.558 --> 01:29:25.393
GIVEN THAT THE GOAL HERE IS TO

01:29:25.460 --> 01:29:27.095
INCREASE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

01:29:27.161 --> 01:29:29.530
WE THINK THAT IT MAY MAKE SENSE

01:29:29.597 --> 01:29:30.965
TO START WITH ADDRESSING THE

01:29:31.032 --> 01:29:32.533
UNMET NEED IN THE SYSTEM.

01:29:32.600 --> 01:29:34.569
BEFORE TURNING TO EXPANDING FEE

01:29:34.635 --> 01:29:36.003
WAIVERS FOR STUDENTS WITH OUT

01:29:36.070 --> 01:29:38.639
NEED.

01:29:38.706 --> 01:29:40.608
I THEIR CONCERN JUST RETURNS TO

01:29:40.675 --> 01:29:41.309
THE POINT THAT THE COLLEGE

01:29:41.375 --> 01:29:42.944
PROMISE PROGRAM IS INTENDED TO

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:44.412
INCENTIVIZE COLLEGES TO IMPROVE

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:45.413
SKIN SUPPORT.

01:29:45.480 --> 01:29:46.514
HERE WE JUST NOTE THAT THE

01:29:46.581 --> 01:29:48.149
LEGISLATURE HAS ALSO ENACTED

01:29:48.216 --> 01:29:51.052
NUMBER OF REFORMS INCLUDING THE

01:29:51.119 --> 01:29:51.853
SKIN CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA.

01:29:51.919 --> 01:29:53.888
THAT PROVIDE LARGER INCENTIVES

01:29:53.955 --> 01:29:55.523
FOR COLLEGES TO IMPROVE STUDENT

01:29:55.590 --> 01:29:57.191
SUPPORT NOW COMES.

01:29:57.258 --> 01:29:58.459
SO FOR THESE REASONS WE DO

01:29:58.526 --> 01:29:59.594
RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:01.262
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO AUGMENT

01:30:01.329 --> 01:30:01.896
FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGE PROMISE

01:30:01.963 --> 01:30:05.500
PROGRAM.

01:30:05.566 --> 01:30:06.367
AT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE

01:30:06.434 --> 01:30:07.935
SHARED THERE IS ALSO A RELATED

01:30:08.002 --> 01:30:09.103
PUZZLED PROVIDE FIVE MILLION IN

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.004
ONE TIME FUNDS.

01:30:10.071 --> 01:30:11.506
EXPAND OUTREACH RELATED TO THE

01:30:11.572 --> 01:30:13.975
COLLEGE PROMISE AND OTHER

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:14.809
STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS.

01:30:14.876 --> 01:30:15.309
OUR OFFICE IS CURRENTLY

01:30:15.376 --> 01:30:17.245
REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL AND WILL

01:30:17.311 --> 01:30:18.346
BE SURE TO KEEP THE COMMITTEE

01:30:18.412 --> 01:30:20.148
AND STAFF UPDATED AS WE REACH AN

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:21.616
ASSESSMENT.

01:30:21.682 --> 01:30:22.517
THANK YOU WOULD BE HAPPY TO TAKE

01:30:22.583 --> 01:30:24.786
QUESTIONS.

01:30:24.852 --> 01:30:26.654
I'M SURE HELLO.

01:30:26.721 --> 01:30:27.922
THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

01:30:27.989 --> 01:30:31.092
SO AS WE SEE IN THE EXAMPLE OF

01:30:31.159 --> 01:30:33.327
TUITION ONLY ACCOUNTS 45% OF

01:30:33.394 --> 01:30:35.763
TOTAL COST OF GOING TO A

01:30:35.830 --> 01:30:36.364
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:30:36.430 --> 01:30:38.733
SO MY QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:40.668
THE ELLIE -- SEES A ROLE FOR A

01:30:40.735 --> 01:30:42.336
TARGETED GRANT PROGRAM.

01:30:42.403 --> 01:30:44.071
THAT ADDRESSES THE NON TUITION

01:30:44.138 --> 01:30:46.340
COSTS FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:48.843
STUDENTS.

01:30:48.910 --> 01:30:50.378
WELL THE ANSWER THAT QUESTION

01:30:50.444 --> 01:30:52.113
AND OUR ASSESSMENT OF THIS

01:30:52.180 --> 01:30:53.948
PARTICULAR PROPOSAL OFFICE HAS

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:56.317
IN THE PAST EXPLORED OPTIONS TO

01:30:56.384 --> 01:30:58.152
EXPAND ON TUITION COVERAGE. FOR

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:58.686
STUDENTS AT THE COMMUNITY

01:30:58.753 --> 01:31:00.888
COLLEGES AND AT OTHER PUBLIC

01:31:00.955 --> 01:31:02.190
SEGMENTS.

01:31:02.256 --> 01:31:03.825
I HAVE A FEW YEARS AGO RELEASED

01:31:03.891 --> 01:31:04.792
RECORD ON CUTTING IT UP FOR

01:31:04.859 --> 01:31:05.760
COLLEGE PUZZLE THAT EXAMINES

01:31:05.827 --> 01:31:06.627
THAT KIND OF MODEL.

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:08.229
AND WE DID THAT AT THE REQUEST

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:09.730
OF THE LEGISLATURE.

01:31:09.797 --> 01:31:11.065
THERE ARE ALSO A FEW EXISTING

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.433
PROGRAMS FUNDED THROUGH

01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:13.835
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS

01:31:13.901 --> 01:31:16.504
THAT ARE LISTED ON PAGE FIFTEEN

01:31:16.571 --> 01:31:17.772
OF YOUR AGENDA.

01:31:17.839 --> 01:31:19.307
THAT SEEK TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE

01:31:19.373 --> 01:31:21.409
NON TUITION COSTS FACED BY THE

01:31:21.475 --> 01:31:21.676
STUDENTS.

01:31:21.742 --> 01:31:23.578
BUT EVEN WITH THESE PROGRAMS IN

01:31:23.644 --> 01:31:25.279
PLACE MANY STUDENTS YOU HAVE

01:31:25.346 --> 01:31:26.747
UNMET NEEDS AS YOU KNOW.

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:29.450
VERY GOOD SO I DO HAVE A BILL.

HELP FIND A SOLUTION FOR NON

01:31:33.287 --> 01:31:34.689
TUITION COSTS.

01:31:34.755 --> 01:31:36.023
AND MY HOPE IS THAT OF COURSE

01:31:36.090 --> 01:31:37.058
BECAUSE THE GOVERNOR'S DESK AND

01:31:37.124 --> 01:31:38.793
HE SIGNS IT I JUST HAVE A REAL

01:31:38.860 --> 01:31:40.695
CONCERN THAT YOU KNOW IN THE

01:31:40.761 --> 01:31:43.264
EXAMPLE THAT YOU -- PROVIDED ON

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:45.132
PAGE NINETEEN IT'S JUST SO

01:31:45.199 --> 01:31:47.702
CLEARLY LAYS OUT THE TUITION IS

01:31:47.768 --> 01:31:50.004
JUST SUCH A SMALL FRACTION OF

01:31:50.071 --> 01:31:51.873
WHAT THE STUDENTS -- NEED TO

01:31:51.939 --> 01:31:53.407
COME UP WITH AND PAY IN ORDER TO

01:31:53.474 --> 01:31:54.375
GO TO COMMUNICATE COMMITTEE

01:31:54.442 --> 01:31:55.076
COLLEGE THERE'S HOPE THAT WE CAN

01:31:55.142 --> 01:31:57.445
ALL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT

01:31:57.511 --> 01:31:58.679
AND LOOK AT THE OTHER THINGS

01:31:58.746 --> 01:31:59.747
THAT OUR STUDENTS NEED SO THAT

01:31:59.814 --> 01:32:00.448
THEY CAN.

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:03.951
COMPLETE THEIR DEGREE OR THEIR

01:32:04.018 --> 01:32:04.252
CERTIFICATE.

01:32:04.318 --> 01:32:07.221
THANK YOU.

01:32:07.288 --> 01:32:09.557
WE WILL LIVE. ZERO IT YOU GO

01:32:09.624 --> 01:32:11.092
COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THEN I

01:32:11.158 --> 01:32:12.994
HAVE AN OBSERVATION BUT SOUNDS

01:32:13.060 --> 01:32:15.263
GOOD I'M GONNA GO BACK TO THE

01:32:15.329 --> 01:32:16.264
PACKET A AHEAD OF WE HAVE

01:32:16.330 --> 01:32:17.531
PREPARED AND START ON PAGE SEVEN

01:32:17.598 --> 01:32:19.300
AND THEN I THINK I'LL BE TAKING

01:32:19.367 --> 01:32:22.270
A A BROADER VIEW OF COLLEGE

01:32:22.336 --> 01:32:23.604
AFFORDABILITY -- THAT WE'VE

01:32:23.671 --> 01:32:25.606

01:32:27.341 --> 01:32:28.409
SENATOR OUT THIS GOES TO TO YOUR

01:32:28.476 --> 01:32:30.211

WE'VE SHOWN YOU TWO CHARTS THERE.

01:32:34.148 --> 01:32:35.783
I THINK -- WHAT WE SEE IN THOSE

CHARTS IS THAT WE SERVE A -- AN

01:32:39.253 --> 01:32:41.088
OLDER POPULATION OF STUDENTS

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:42.256
STUDENTS WHO ARE COMING TO

01:32:42.323 --> 01:32:45.726
HIGHER EDUCATION DIRECTLY FROM

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:46.560
HIGH SCHOOL.

01:32:46.627 --> 01:32:47.261
MORE THAN 40% OF OUR STUDENTS

01:32:47.328 --> 01:32:49.330
ROACH OVER THE AGE OF TWENTY

01:32:49.397 --> 01:32:50.665
FIVE AND IT IN ITS SKEWS

01:32:50.731 --> 01:32:52.266
SIGNIFICANTLY OLDER GENERALLY.

01:32:52.333 --> 01:32:53.167
WE ALSO SEE ON THE RIGHT THAT WE

01:32:53.234 --> 01:32:56.003
SERVE A CONSIDERABLY DIVERSE

01:32:56.070 --> 01:32:58.272
STUDENT POPULATION WITH A NEARLY

01:32:58.339 --> 01:33:00.241
HALF OF OUR STUDENTS IDENTIFY AS

01:33:00.308 --> 01:33:01.142
LATIN ACTS.

01:33:01.208 --> 01:33:04.545
AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THAT.

01:33:04.612 --> 01:33:06.047
YOU KNOW A COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:06.881
IN THE STATE'S POLICIES AROUND

01:33:06.948 --> 01:33:08.416
CULTURE FORTY ABILITY I THINK WE

01:33:08.482 --> 01:33:10.685
YOU KNOW WE CARE A LOT ABOUT WHO --

01:33:10.751 --> 01:33:12.286
THE EQUITY ISSUES ASSOCIATED

01:33:12.353 --> 01:33:13.754
WITH -- OURS INSTITUTIONS ARE

01:33:13.821 --> 01:33:15.456
SERVING AND HOW AFFORDABLE IT IS

01:33:15.523 --> 01:33:16.057
BEEN.

01:33:16.123 --> 01:33:18.392
US ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE SEVEN

01:33:18.459 --> 01:33:21.128
AGAIN WE TALKED ABOUT -- NO THE

01:33:21.195 --> 01:33:22.330
INFORMATION SHARED THIS

01:33:22.396 --> 01:33:24.432
CONVERSATION HAS FOCUSED ON

01:33:24.498 --> 01:33:27.768
TUITION -- AND WE I THINK ARE

01:33:27.835 --> 01:33:29.971
VERY -- PROUD OF A HISTORY OF

01:33:30.037 --> 01:33:32.139
LOW TUITION AND OF THE FACT THAT

01:33:32.206 --> 01:33:34.175
MOST OF OUR STUDENTS -- NEARLY

01:33:34.241 --> 01:33:35.977
HALF OF OUR STUDENTS.

01:33:36.043 --> 01:33:37.278
DON'T PAY TUITION.

01:33:37.345 --> 01:33:40.715
AB NINETEEN I THINK THE ONE

01:33:40.781 --> 01:33:41.349
THING I WOULD WANT TO KNOW TODAY

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:41.916
MOVING TO PAGE.

01:33:41.983 --> 01:33:45.686
DOES THAT MEAN JUST INTERRUPT

01:33:45.753 --> 01:33:47.621
AND I APOLOGIZE BUT DOES.

01:33:47.688 --> 01:33:48.823
DO YOU CAPTURE ALL OF THOSE WHO

01:33:48.889 --> 01:33:50.257
HAVE FINANCIAL NEED.

01:33:50.324 --> 01:33:52.293
WITH I GUESS WHAT YOU WE USED TO

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.894
CALL THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS

01:33:53.961 --> 01:33:54.595
WAIVER.

01:33:54.662 --> 01:33:55.997
SO WITHOUT THAT THEN WE HAVE A

01:33:56.063 --> 01:33:57.832
DEFINITION OF FINANCIAL NEED AS

01:33:57.898 --> 01:33:59.500
PART OF THE PROGRAM AND WE SAY

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:01.202
IF YOU HAVE FINANCIAL NEED YOU

01:34:01.268 --> 01:34:02.803
HAVE YOUR TUITION WAVED.

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:04.472
US STUDENTS WOULD ALSO HAVE

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:06.507
THEIR FEES WAIVED OB IF THEY

01:34:06.574 --> 01:34:08.509
RECEIVED -- OTHER FORMS OF

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:10.911
PUBLIC ASSISTANCE OR IF THEY

01:34:10.978 --> 01:34:12.146
FALL BELOW CERTAIN INCOME

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.382
THRESHOLDS SO WE'VE TAKEN CARE

01:34:14.448 --> 01:34:15.883
OF THOSE WITH.

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.651
WHAT I WOULD CALL FINANCIAL NEED

01:34:17.718 --> 01:34:19.720
WE HAVE FOCUSED CROSSES AT THE

01:34:19.787 --> 01:34:24.725
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CORRECT?

01:34:24.792 --> 01:34:25.793
I MEAN THE ROUGH BUT IT'S ONE OF

01:34:25.860 --> 01:34:27.228
THE OF COURSE.

01:34:27.294 --> 01:34:28.295
I'M ON THE TOP OF PAGE IT I

01:34:28.362 --> 01:34:29.096
WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT

01:34:29.163 --> 01:34:30.898
ALTHOUGH A B. -- NINETEEN THE

01:34:30.965 --> 01:34:31.432
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE

01:34:31.499 --> 01:34:33.968
PROGRAM TALKS -- IT IS IT IS

01:34:34.035 --> 01:34:34.702
BEEN LARGELY TALKED ABOUT AS A

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:36.670
FREE TUITION PROGRAM IF YOU LOOK

01:34:36.737 --> 01:34:38.339
AT THE GOALS -- THAT THE

01:34:38.406 --> 01:34:40.941
LEGISLATURE SAT IN A B. NINETEEN

01:34:41.008 --> 01:34:42.343
THE GOALS ARE MUCH BROADER --

01:34:42.410 --> 01:34:43.744
AND THEY ARE VERY CONSISTENT

01:34:43.811 --> 01:34:45.046
WITH THE BOARD'S VISION TO

01:34:45.112 --> 01:34:46.614
INCREASE COLLEGE PREPARATION FOR

01:34:46.680 --> 01:34:48.416
STUDENTS TO IMPROVE PREPARATION

01:34:48.482 --> 01:34:50.351
FOR IN DEMAND JOBS TO INCREASE

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:51.085
TRANSFER.

01:34:51.152 --> 01:34:52.953
AND ELIMINATE EQUITY GAPS ACROSS

01:34:53.020 --> 01:34:54.021
REGIONS IN ACROSS GROUPS OF

01:34:54.088 --> 01:34:55.222
STUDENTS.

01:34:55.289 --> 01:34:56.490
AND SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

01:34:56.557 --> 01:34:57.625
PROGRAM THERE'S A SET OF

01:34:57.691 --> 01:34:58.926
PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:34:58.993 --> 01:35:00.194
THEY PARTNER WITH LOCAL

01:35:00.261 --> 01:35:03.097
EDUCATION AGENCIES THAT USE THE

01:35:03.164 --> 01:35:04.131
ABLE MAN OUR REFORMS TO

01:35:04.198 --> 01:35:06.000
DEVELOPMENTAL EDUCATION THEY

01:35:06.067 --> 01:35:07.435
PARTICIPATING GOTTA PATHWAYS.

01:35:07.501 --> 01:35:08.736
AND THEY MAKE SURE THAT STUDENTS

01:35:08.803 --> 01:35:10.271
HAVE ACCESS TO THE RANGE OF

01:35:10.337 --> 01:35:12.306
FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE

01:35:12.373 --> 01:35:15.910
INCLUDING FEDERAL LOANS -- WHICH

01:35:15.976 --> 01:35:17.078
IT WE ARE I THINK OUR POSITION

01:35:17.144 --> 01:35:18.846
THERE HAS VERY CLEARLY BEEN WE

01:35:18.913 --> 01:35:20.781
DON'T -- WE WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE

01:35:20.848 --> 01:35:21.482
AN ENVIRONMENT AND WE'LL TALK

01:35:21.549 --> 01:35:23.984
LATER ABOUT -- OUR PLAN FOR HOW

01:35:24.051 --> 01:35:25.719
YOU REDUCE -- BORROWING BUT THAT

01:35:25.786 --> 01:35:27.488
STUDENTS WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS

01:35:27.555 --> 01:35:29.323
TO FEDERAL LOANS -- ARE OFTEN

01:35:29.390 --> 01:35:32.093
FORCED INTO LESS DESIRABLE WAYS

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:33.527
OF BORROWING OR INTO WORKING

01:35:33.594 --> 01:35:39.767
UNREASONABLE AMOUNTS OF OURS TO

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:42.403
MEET THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS.

01:35:42.470 --> 01:35:43.571
AND SO THAT'S HOW THE STILL BE

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:44.405
INSTITUTIONS GET INTO THE

01:35:44.472 --> 01:35:45.339
PROGRAM -- THEY CAN USE THE

01:35:45.406 --> 01:35:46.207
MONEY TO WAIVE TUITION FOR THOSE

01:35:46.273 --> 01:35:46.874
STUDENTS WHO ARE FIRST TIME FULL

01:35:46.941 --> 01:35:47.508
TIME STUDENTS BUT THEY CAN USE

01:35:47.575 --> 01:35:48.976
IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES THAT ALSO

01:35:49.043 --> 01:35:49.910
WOULD.

01:35:49.977 --> 01:35:51.645
ALLOW THE INSTITUTION TO MEET

01:35:51.712 --> 01:35:52.613
THOSE GOALS.

01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:54.014
AND SO IF YOU GO TO THE TOP OF

01:35:54.081 --> 01:35:55.683
PAGE NINE I WOULD JUST NOTE OF

01:35:55.749 --> 01:35:57.251
THE PROGRAM IN THE CURRENT YEAR

01:35:57.318 --> 01:35:58.185
WAS FUNDED WITH FORTY SIX

01:35:58.252 --> 01:35:58.686
MILLION.

01:35:58.752 --> 01:36:01.322
WE ALLOCATED MOST OF THE DOLLARS --

01:36:01.388 --> 01:36:02.857
THE COLLEGES BASED ON THE NUMBER

01:36:02.923 --> 01:36:04.258
OF THOSE FIRST TIME FULL TIME

01:36:04.325 --> 01:36:05.526
STUDENTS WHO WEREN'T ALREADY

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:07.595
RECEIVING FEE WAIVERS BUT WE

01:36:07.661 --> 01:36:09.630
ALSO TOOK INTO ACCOUNT -- THE

01:36:09.697 --> 01:36:11.098
ENROLLMENT AT THE COLLEGES AND

01:36:11.165 --> 01:36:12.733
THE NUMBER OF POCKET RECIPIENTS

01:36:12.800 --> 01:36:14.735
OF THE COLLEGES IN NINETEEN

01:36:14.802 --> 01:36:15.903
TWENTY UP THE LEVEL OF

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:17.171
PREPARATIONS OF EIGHTY MILLION

01:36:17.238 --> 01:36:18.539
OF THE GOVERNOR PROPOSES.

01:36:18.606 --> 01:36:20.808
WE WOULD LIKELY -- ALLOCATE

01:36:20.875 --> 01:36:22.376
FUNDING -- OLD WE BASED ON THE

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:25.279
NUMBER FOR FIRST TIME FULL TIME

01:36:25.346 --> 01:36:26.714
STUDENTS.

01:36:26.780 --> 01:36:27.815
ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- NINE WE

01:36:27.882 --> 01:36:29.316
PRODUCED A CHART THAT IS VERY

01:36:29.383 --> 01:36:30.985
SIMILAR TO THE CHART AND THE

01:36:31.051 --> 01:36:31.952
AGENDA THE CHART ON THE AGENDA

01:36:32.019 --> 01:36:33.654
LOOKED AT SAN DIEGO MESA COLLEGE

01:36:33.721 --> 01:36:36.056
WE LOOK HERE AT RIVERSIDE CITY

01:36:36.123 --> 01:36:36.757
COLLEGE.

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.759
AND AGAIN THE SAME POINT THAT A

01:36:38.826 --> 01:36:40.194
VERY SMALL -- FOR ALL OF

01:36:40.261 --> 01:36:41.529
REGARDLESS OF THE STUDENTS

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:43.597
LIVING SITUATION LESS THAN 10%

01:36:43.664 --> 01:36:46.333
OF THE FUNDS OF THE COST OF

01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.701
ATTENDING A COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:36:47.768 --> 01:36:50.404
ARE THOSE COSTS OF TUITION AND

01:36:50.471 --> 01:36:52.006
FEES.

01:36:52.072 --> 01:36:53.774
ON PAGE TEN I JUST WANT TO GO TO

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:55.376
YOUR POINT SENATOR ROTH -- THERE

01:36:55.442 --> 01:36:56.710
ARE BARRIERS IN THE CURRENT CAL

01:36:56.777 --> 01:36:58.712
GRANT PROGRAMS THAT MAKE IT VERY

01:36:58.779 --> 01:37:00.314
UNLIKELY THAT A STUDENT AT THE

01:37:00.381 --> 01:37:02.116
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.417
WOULD RECEIVE A CHARACTER AND

01:37:03.484 --> 01:37:05.186
THE PRIMARY BERRIER -- IS THAT

01:37:05.252 --> 01:37:06.587
IN ORDER TO BE ENTITLED TO AN

01:37:06.654 --> 01:37:08.522
AWARD THE STUDENT MUST ROLAND

01:37:08.589 --> 01:37:12.026
COLLEGE NO LATER THAN ONE YEAR

01:37:12.092 --> 01:37:13.327
AFTER HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATION.

01:37:13.394 --> 01:37:14.328
IF A STUDENT DOES NOT GET AN

01:37:14.395 --> 01:37:16.797
ENTITLEMENT THEY ARE COMPETING

01:37:16.864 --> 01:37:19.300
FOR ONE OF TWENTY SIX THOUSAND

01:37:19.366 --> 01:37:20.067
AWARDS.

01:37:20.134 --> 01:37:21.669
IN A RECENT ANALYSIS SHOWED THAT

01:37:21.735 --> 01:37:23.404
MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.372
STUDENTS OUR COMPETING FOR THESE

01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:26.707
AWARDS.

01:37:26.774 --> 01:37:27.741
SO IT'S LESS THAN A WATT

01:37:27.808 --> 01:37:29.243
INTENTIONS.

01:37:29.310 --> 01:37:31.245
AND THEN -- BECAUSE THE CAL

01:37:31.312 --> 01:37:33.180
GRANT PROGRAM IS LARGELY LINKED

01:37:33.247 --> 01:37:35.282
TO TUITION VERY FEW COMMUNITY

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.251
CALL A VERY FEW OF THE DOLLARS.

01:37:37.318 --> 01:37:39.386
I GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:37:39.453 --> 01:37:39.920
STUDENTS.

01:37:39.987 --> 01:37:42.189
SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM OF

01:37:42.256 --> 01:37:43.624
PAGE TEN ARE WE SHOW ON THE LEFT

01:37:43.691 --> 01:37:45.326
HAND SIDE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

01:37:45.392 --> 01:37:46.527
WHO WERE RECEIVING AWARDS.

01:37:46.594 --> 01:37:48.162
SO NEARLY A MILLION STUDENTS

01:37:48.229 --> 01:37:50.864
RECEIVE THE CALIFORNIA COLLEGE

01:37:50.931 --> 01:37:51.232
PROMISE GRANT.

01:37:51.298 --> 01:37:53.334
AROUND A HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:37:53.400 --> 01:37:55.069
STUDENTS RECEIVE CALTRANS.

01:37:55.135 --> 01:37:56.136
ALSO WE'VE DECIDED THAT THE

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:57.705
STUDENTS RECEIVE THE CALLS FROM

01:37:57.771 --> 01:37:58.872
SCREENER FINANCIALLY NEEDY --

01:37:58.939 --> 01:38:01.375
BUT ARE LESS THAN 10% OF THEM

01:38:01.442 --> 01:38:03.077
ARE RECEIVING CAL GRANTS BUT IF

01:38:03.143 --> 01:38:04.612
YOU LOOK AT THE RIGHT SIDE.

01:38:04.678 --> 01:38:06.313
OF THE VERY FEW OF THE CALIBER

01:38:06.380 --> 01:38:07.815
OF DOLLARS ARE GOING TO

01:38:07.881 --> 01:38:09.216
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO

01:38:09.283 --> 01:38:10.951
WITH WE IN TERMS OF COMMUNITY

01:38:11.018 --> 01:38:15.656
COLLEGE IN CALGARY A REFORM.

01:38:15.723 --> 01:38:16.890
IT IT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE.

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:18.559
MORE THAN JUST INCREASING THE

01:38:18.626 --> 01:38:20.928
NUMBER OF COMPETITIVE AWARDS

01:38:20.995 --> 01:38:22.930
CORRECT WE BELIEVE AS I RECALL

01:38:22.997 --> 01:38:25.232
IF WE TOOK THE SECOND YEAR OF

01:38:25.299 --> 01:38:26.467
THE PROMISE MONEY WE COULD

01:38:26.533 --> 01:38:28.369
PROBABLY DOUBLE THE COMPETITIVE

01:38:28.435 --> 01:38:31.205
AWARDS MAYBE. TO FIFTY THOUSAND

01:38:31.272 --> 01:38:32.706
FROM TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND OR

01:38:32.773 --> 01:38:33.607
SOMETHING LIKE THAT POTENTIALLY

01:38:33.674 --> 01:38:35.075
I WOULD SAY ONE OF THE CONCERNS

01:38:35.142 --> 01:38:36.777
WE HAVE IN THIS CONVERSATION --

01:38:36.844 --> 01:38:39.046
AND SENATOR LABOR THIS BILL --

01:38:39.113 --> 01:38:40.414
NOTES THIS IN ITS INTENT NOT

01:38:40.481 --> 01:38:41.649
ONLY DO COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:38:41.715 --> 01:38:43.450
STUDENTS RECEIVED VERY LITTLE

01:38:43.517 --> 01:38:44.752
AND FINANCIAL AID BUT OUR

01:38:44.818 --> 01:38:46.353
INSTITUTIONS ARE FUNDED AND VERY

01:38:46.420 --> 01:38:47.821
LOW LOW LEVELS OF PER STUDENT

01:38:47.888 --> 01:38:49.823
FUNDING COMBAT SPECIALLY

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.292
COMPARED TO UC AND CSU.

01:38:51.358 --> 01:38:53.060
EVEN LOWER COMPARED TO K. TWELVE

01:38:53.127 --> 01:38:54.895
AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:56.463
WOULD -- HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT A

01:38:56.530 --> 01:38:58.198
PROPOSAL LIKE THAT -- IS THAT WE

01:38:58.265 --> 01:38:59.733
WOULD BE TAKING PROPOSITION

01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:00.701
NINETY EIGHT DOLLARS POTENTIALLY

01:39:00.768 --> 01:39:02.403
IN USING IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES

01:39:02.469 --> 01:39:03.871
WHAT OUR INSTITUTIONS NEED THAT

01:39:03.937 --> 01:39:05.372
ONEY.

01:39:05.439 --> 01:39:06.807
TO AND SO I THINK WHAT SENATOR

01:39:06.874 --> 01:39:09.343
LABORS BILL WE ARE VERY MUCH

01:39:09.410 --> 01:39:11.345
SUPPORT -- THEY APPROACH CENTER

01:39:11.412 --> 01:39:12.680
LATEST TAKEN IN HER BILL -- OF

01:39:12.746 --> 01:39:14.248
ALLOCATING FUNDING OUTSIDE OF

01:39:14.315 --> 01:39:15.749
THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED TO

01:39:15.816 --> 01:39:17.551
SUPPORT THE THE ISSUES OF

01:39:17.618 --> 01:39:18.919
AFFORDABILITY AT COMMUNITY

01:39:18.986 --> 01:39:21.255
COLLEGES BUT I MEAN I MY POINT

01:39:21.322 --> 01:39:22.690
WAS THE MAGNITUDE OF THE DOLLARS

01:39:22.756 --> 01:39:24.391
IT IS LISTED AS INCREASING THE

01:39:24.458 --> 01:39:25.392
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM WE

01:39:25.459 --> 01:39:26.493
HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT THE

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:29.196
COMPETITIVE GRANT PROGRAM DOES.

01:39:29.263 --> 01:39:30.564
VIS A VIS OMMUNITY COLLEGES

01:39:30.631 --> 01:39:37.071
BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE IT'S NOT

01:39:37.137 --> 01:39:38.972
NECESSARILY THE FEE.

01:39:39.039 --> 01:39:40.908
IT'S THE LIVING EXPENSES EVEN

01:39:40.974 --> 01:39:43.010
FOR STUDENTS WHO GOT WHO --

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:45.012
RECEITA WHO WINDOW THE THE PRICE

01:39:45.079 --> 01:39:45.579
TO GET THAT COMPETITIVE CAL

01:39:45.646 --> 01:39:46.380
GRANT THEY GET A VERY SMALL

01:39:46.447 --> 01:39:47.047
AMOUNT OF MONEY AT THE COMMUNITY

01:39:47.114 --> 01:39:47.981
COLLEGE OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED

01:39:48.048 --> 01:39:49.616
DOLLARS IS THE LIVING STIPEND

01:39:49.683 --> 01:39:50.317
THAT THAT.

01:39:50.384 --> 01:39:51.151
THAT THOSE STUDENTS WOULD

01:39:51.218 --> 01:39:55.956
RECEIVE DEMEANOR UP AND DOWN AND

01:39:56.023 --> 01:39:56.790
OUT.

01:39:56.857 --> 01:39:57.991
SOMEONE PAGE -- ELEVEN WE'VE

01:39:58.058 --> 01:39:58.792
JUST COMPARE THEIR ENROLLMENT

01:39:58.859 --> 01:40:00.361
ACROSS THE THREE PUBLIC SEGMENTS

01:40:00.427 --> 01:40:02.262
WHERE YOU SEE THAT ENROLLMENT

01:40:02.329 --> 01:40:03.297
EARLY AND ENROLLMENT IF HOW

01:40:03.364 --> 01:40:03.731
GREAT RECIPIENTS IS

01:40:03.797 --> 01:40:04.932
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER AT THE

01:40:04.998 --> 01:40:05.933
COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO THE CAL

01:40:05.999 --> 01:40:07.468
GRANT FUNDS THAT ARE ALLOCATED

01:40:07.534 --> 01:40:09.336
ACROSS THOSE -- THREE INSTITUTE

01:40:09.403 --> 01:40:11.438
A THREE SEGMENTS WHERE THE WERE

01:40:11.505 --> 01:40:13.474
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RECEIVES

01:40:13.540 --> 01:40:15.409
BY FAR -- OF LOS MEDI CAL GRANT

01:40:15.476 --> 01:40:17.044
FUND AGAIN FOR THOSE TWO

01:40:17.111 --> 01:40:18.412
PURPOSES AND AND I WOULD SAY WE

01:40:18.479 --> 01:40:19.913
MAKE THIS COMPARISON NOT TO SAY

01:40:19.980 --> 01:40:21.148
THAT.

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:22.750
OTHERS SHOULD RECEIVE LESS BUT

01:40:22.816 --> 01:40:23.884
TO SAY THAT WE KNOW HOW TO

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:26.253
PROVIDE AID TO STUDENTS IN OTHER

01:40:26.320 --> 01:40:27.988
PLACES WERE JUST NOT PROVIDING

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:29.223
IT TO THIS SEGMENT.

01:40:29.289 --> 01:40:31.859
THAT IS SERVING A CONSIDERABLY A

01:40:31.925 --> 01:40:33.293
VERY DIVERSE POPULATION IN A

01:40:33.360 --> 01:40:34.962
POPULATION OF OLDER STUDENTS WHO

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:38.832
HAVE FACED THE HIGHEST BIDDERS

01:40:38.899 --> 01:40:40.167
TO ACCESS.

01:40:40.234 --> 01:40:40.834
AND SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE IMPACT

01:40:40.901 --> 01:40:42.736
ON THE BOTTOM OF PAGE -- ELEVEN

01:40:42.803 --> 01:40:43.604
YOU'LL SEE THAT ACROSS TE THE

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:45.339
INSTITUTE FOR COLLEGE ACCESS AND

01:40:45.406 --> 01:40:46.473
SUCCESS DID AN ANALYSIS AND

01:40:46.540 --> 01:40:47.674
SHOWS THAT IN.

01:40:47.741 --> 01:40:49.309
ALL NINE REGIONS WHERE THERE'S

01:40:49.376 --> 01:40:51.779
AN UNDERGRADUATE UC CAMPUS.

01:40:51.845 --> 01:40:54.615
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:40:54.681 --> 01:40:55.783
DON'T HAVE THE LOWEST IN THAT

01:40:55.849 --> 01:40:57.484
PRICE FOR THE LOWEST INCOME

01:40:57.551 --> 01:40:59.386
STUDENTS AND IN SEVEN OF THOSE

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:00.487
REGIONS THEY'RE THE MOST EXPECT

01:41:00.554 --> 01:41:03.857
A EXPENSIVE OPTION FOR STUDENTS.

01:41:03.924 --> 01:41:05.159
ON PAGE TWELVE WE'LL TALK ABOUT

01:41:05.225 --> 01:41:06.794
THIS MORE THE NEXT AGENDA ITEM

01:41:06.860 --> 01:41:08.629
BUT THERE'S AN IMPACT NOT ONLY

01:41:08.695 --> 01:41:09.596
ON STUDENT SUCCESS.

01:41:09.663 --> 01:41:11.265
BUT ON THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR

01:41:11.331 --> 01:41:12.299
STUDENTS WHILE THEY'RE ATTENDING

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:14.501
COLLEGE ARE THE HOPE CENTER --

01:41:14.568 --> 01:41:15.736
FOR COLLEGE COMMUNITY AND

01:41:15.803 --> 01:41:18.639
JUSTICE DID A A STUDY OF BASIC

01:41:18.705 --> 01:41:20.007
NEEDS SECURITY IN OUR COLLEGES.

01:41:20.073 --> 01:41:21.341
AND FOUND THAT HALF OF OUR

01:41:21.408 --> 01:41:22.676
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WERE

01:41:22.743 --> 01:41:24.044
FITTED SECURE IN THE PAST THIRTY

01:41:24.111 --> 01:41:26.146
DAYS 60% WERE HOUSING IN

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:28.081
SECURITY AND SECURE AND NEARLY

01:41:28.148 --> 01:41:30.484
ONE IN FIVE FOR HOMELESS IN THE

01:41:30.551 --> 01:41:32.119
PREVIOUS YEAR.

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:33.120
SO THAT ALL LEADS US.

01:41:33.187 --> 01:41:35.556
TO OUR BIG CALL FOR REFORM WE'VE

01:41:35.622 --> 01:41:39.793
GOT SHOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:41:39.860 --> 01:41:41.862
FINANCIAL AID BASED ON FINANCIAL

01:41:41.929 --> 01:41:43.764
NEED NOTHING ELSE.

01:41:43.831 --> 01:41:44.998
THAT THEY SHOULD BE THAT

01:41:45.065 --> 01:41:46.166
FINANCIAL AID SHOULD BE LINKED

01:41:46.233 --> 01:41:47.434
TO THE TOTAL COST NOT JUST

01:41:47.501 --> 01:41:48.602
TUITION AND FEES.

01:41:48.669 --> 01:41:49.903
AND THAT IT SHOULD BE AVAILABLE

01:41:49.970 --> 01:41:51.438
EQUITABLY ACROSS EDUCATIONAL

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:53.173
GOALS NOT NECESSARILY FOCUSED

01:41:53.240 --> 01:41:55.375
ONLY ON STUDENTS SEEKING DEGREES

01:41:55.442 --> 01:41:56.643
ARE -- TO TRANSFER TO A FOUR

01:41:56.710 --> 01:41:58.479
YEAR INSTITUTION BUT ALSO THOSE

01:41:58.545 --> 01:42:01.081
WHO COME TO OUR COLLEGES WITH

01:42:01.148 --> 01:42:02.049
CAREER TECHNICAL EDUCATION GOALS.

01:42:02.115 --> 01:42:03.917
AND SO ON PAGE THIRTEEN JUST TO

01:42:03.984 --> 01:42:07.888
CLOSE -- WE THINK -- SP TWO

01:42:07.955 --> 01:42:09.089
NINETY ONE US AUTHORED BY

01:42:09.156 --> 01:42:11.191
SENATOR LLEVA IS THE RIGHT WAY

01:42:11.258 --> 01:42:13.794
TO GO WE ARE VERY PROUD TO

01:42:13.861 --> 01:42:15.329
FOLLOW IN HER LEADERSHIP.

01:42:15.395 --> 01:42:17.231
ON THESE ISSUES ESSENTIALLY THE

01:42:17.297 --> 01:42:19.132
BILL CREATES A NEW GRANT PROGRAM

01:42:19.199 --> 01:42:20.601
THAT WE CONSIDER THE TOTAL COST

01:42:20.667 --> 01:42:21.568
OF ATTENDANCE.

01:42:21.635 --> 01:42:23.637
SUBTRACT OUT WHAT WE EXPECT

01:42:23.704 --> 01:42:25.639
STUDENTS ND FAMILIES TO PAY AS

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:28.375
WELL AS WHAT THE WHAT OTHER

01:42:28.442 --> 01:42:29.743
RECEIVING AND CURRENT GRANTED.

01:42:29.810 --> 01:42:32.412
AND THEN THAT DIFFERENCE THAT

01:42:32.479 --> 01:42:33.247
UNMET NEED.

01:42:33.313 --> 01:42:34.047
WOULD BE PROVIDED IN THE FORM OF

01:42:34.114 --> 01:42:35.816
A NEW GRANT THAT WOULD PHASE IN

01:42:35.883 --> 01:42:37.484
OVER SIX YEARS.

01:42:37.551 --> 01:42:39.086
AND SO THE ASK OF THIS COMMITTEE

01:42:39.152 --> 01:42:40.921
OBVIOUSLY -- MR SURE WE WOULD

01:42:40.988 --> 01:42:41.822
LOVE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE BILL

01:42:41.889 --> 01:42:43.991
BUT ALSO TO INCLUDE TWO HUNDRED

01:42:44.057 --> 01:42:44.491
FIFTY MILLION.

01:42:44.558 --> 01:42:46.527
IN THE BUDGET FOR NINETEEN

01:42:46.593 --> 01:42:47.194
TWENTY TO SUPPORT THE FIRST YEAR

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.161
OF IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT PER

01:42:48.228 --> 01:42:49.296
DOES IT ELIMINATE THE

01:42:49.363 --> 01:42:51.064
DISTINCTION BETWEEN ENTITLEMENT

01:42:51.131 --> 01:42:52.666
GRANTS AND COMPETITIVE GRANTS

01:42:52.733 --> 01:42:53.934
FOR PURPOSES OF COMMUNITY

01:42:54.001 --> 01:42:55.536
COLLEGE OF FUNCTIONAL YES IT

01:42:55.602 --> 01:42:57.104
DOESN'T ELIMINATE THE STATUTES

01:42:57.170 --> 01:42:58.205
BUT FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE

01:42:58.272 --> 01:42:59.606
STUDENT THE STUDENT WOULD NO.

01:42:59.673 --> 01:43:00.974
LONGER IF THE STUDENT RECEIVED A

01:43:01.041 --> 01:43:02.309
CAL GRANT THAT WOULD OFFSET THE

01:43:02.376 --> 01:43:03.810
TOTAL COST IF IT DOESN'T WE

01:43:03.877 --> 01:43:05.012
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO

01:43:05.078 --> 01:43:06.446
MAKE UP THE DIFFERENCE BUT STILL

01:43:06.513 --> 01:43:08.949
YOU'D HAVE YOUR LIMITED TO

01:43:09.016 --> 01:43:10.651
TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND COMPETITIVE

01:43:10.717 --> 01:43:11.184
GRANTS SO IF YOU'RE NOT.

01:43:11.251 --> 01:43:12.920
IF YOU'RE NOT.

01:43:12.986 --> 01:43:14.121
A COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENT

01:43:14.187 --> 01:43:15.422
WITHIN A YEAR OF GRADUATING FROM

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:17.524
HIGH SCHOOL AND A LARGE PORTION

01:43:17.591 --> 01:43:20.394
OF YOUR FOLKS OR NOT YEAH -- SO

01:43:20.460 --> 01:43:21.862
THEY GET MORE UNDER THIS PROGRAM

01:43:21.929 --> 01:43:23.497
THAT IS SO YES THEY RECEIVE A

01:43:23.564 --> 01:43:25.566
COMPETITIVE RIO REGARDLESS SO

01:43:25.632 --> 01:43:27.334
THIS PROGRAM IS TO SAY --

01:43:27.401 --> 01:43:30.003
THERE'S A LOT OF REASONS WHY --

01:43:30.070 --> 01:43:32.172
IT'S DIFFICULT TO UNWIND ALL OF

01:43:32.239 --> 01:43:33.273
THESE DECISIONS WE'VE MADE

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:34.474
PREVIOUSLY.

01:43:34.541 --> 01:43:36.043
BUT FOR THE FROM THE PERSPECTIVE

01:43:36.109 --> 01:43:38.245
OF THE STUDENT FINANCIAL AID --

01:43:38.312 --> 01:43:39.746
SHOULD BE AWARDED EQUITABLY IT

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:40.747
SHOULD BE THOSE DECISIONS SHOULD

01:43:40.814 --> 01:43:42.082
BE BLIND TO THE STUDENT THEY

01:43:42.149 --> 01:43:43.417
SHOULD SUBMIT A A FINANCIAL AID

01:43:43.483 --> 01:43:45.285
APPLICATION WE CALCULATE THEIR

01:43:45.352 --> 01:43:46.553
NEED WE LOOK AT WHAT THEY'RE

01:43:46.620 --> 01:43:48.555
GETTING ALREADY AND THEN WE GIVE

01:43:48.622 --> 01:43:51.491
THEM A AN AMOUNT TO GO -- TO

01:43:51.558 --> 01:43:52.259
CLOSE THAT GAP [inaudible]

01:43:52.326 --> 01:43:54.361
PERFECT.

01:43:54.428 --> 01:43:55.028
LET ME ASK YOU.

01:43:55.095 --> 01:43:55.195
SIR.

01:43:55.262 --> 01:43:56.863
I'M GOOD.

01:43:56.930 --> 01:43:58.932
IF I COULD HAVE SAID IT BETTER

01:43:58.999 --> 01:43:59.232
THANK YOU.

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:01.301
I WILL USE THIS NET PRICE FLOOD

01:44:01.368 --> 01:44:02.369
THAT PRICE FOR LOWEST INCOME

01:44:02.436 --> 01:44:04.738
STUDENTS IS THAT BECAUSE THE

01:44:04.805 --> 01:44:06.340
COST OF LIVING IN PARTICULAR

01:44:06.406 --> 01:44:07.407
AREAS.

01:44:07.474 --> 01:44:08.842
AND THE AND THE LACK OF FOR

01:44:08.909 --> 01:44:10.210
EXAMPLE DORMITORIES AND

01:44:10.277 --> 01:44:12.479
COMMUNITY COLLEGES NO IT REALLY

01:44:12.546 --> 01:44:14.414
IS AT THE POINT THERE IS THAT

01:44:14.481 --> 01:44:16.216
THE TOTAL COST IS ACTUALLY

01:44:16.283 --> 01:44:17.951
RELATIVELY SIMILAR ONCE YOU TAKE

01:44:18.018 --> 01:44:19.353
AWAY THE TUITION -- THE

01:44:19.419 --> 01:44:20.654
DIFFERENCES INTUITION ACROSS

01:44:20.721 --> 01:44:22.422
SEGMENTS OF THE OTHER COSTS OF

01:44:22.489 --> 01:44:24.524
ATTENDANCE -- FOOD HOUSING

01:44:24.591 --> 01:44:26.627
TRANSPORTATION ARE RELATIVELY

01:44:26.693 --> 01:44:28.528
SIMILAR CROSS SEGMENTS AND SO

01:44:28.595 --> 01:44:30.697
STUDENTS FACE SIMILAR TOTAL COST

01:44:30.764 --> 01:44:31.999
BUT THEY FACE THEY HAVE

01:44:32.065 --> 01:44:33.467
DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT AMOUNTS

01:44:33.533 --> 01:44:34.735
OF FINANCIAL AID AVAILABLE TO

01:44:34.801 --> 01:44:35.302
THEM.

01:44:35.369 --> 01:44:36.837
WITH STUDENTS AT THE UC WRIST --

01:44:36.903 --> 01:44:38.372
HAVING AVAILABLE THE MOST

01:44:38.438 --> 01:44:39.373
FINANCIALLY.

01:44:39.439 --> 01:44:40.641
AND SO WHEN YOU SUBTRACT OUT

01:44:40.707 --> 01:44:42.476
THAT AID -- YOU FIND THAT

01:44:42.542 --> 01:44:43.944
COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN MANY

01:44:44.011 --> 01:44:45.379
PLACES IN MOST PLACES ARE THE

01:44:45.445 --> 01:44:51.018
MOST EXPECT EXPENSIVE I SHOULD

01:44:51.084 --> 01:44:51.685
BE VERY INTERESTING STATISTIC --

01:44:51.752 --> 01:44:53.353
INTERESTING.

01:44:53.420 --> 01:44:56.289
OKAY I DON'T THINK I HAVE -- ANY

01:44:56.356 --> 01:44:58.725
OTHER QUESTIONS ON THIS.

TO CONDUCT THIS STUDENT SURVEY

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:02.375
AROUND BASIC NEEDS.

01:48:02.442 --> 01:48:04.978
A 50% OF THE STUDENTS REPORTING

01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:06.646
OF HUNGER IN THE PREVIOUS THIRTY

01:48:06.713 --> 01:48:08.915
DAYS 60% REPORTING HOUSING IN

01:48:08.982 --> 01:48:11.618
SECURITY AND 19% REPORTING.

01:48:11.685 --> 01:48:14.087
HAVING EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS

01:48:14.154 --> 01:48:17.991
IN THE PREVIOUS TWELVE MONTHS.

01:48:18.058 --> 01:48:19.860
THE REASONS THERE IS AN INCREASE

01:48:19.926 --> 01:48:21.728
IN HUNGER AND HOMELESSNESS AMONG

01:48:21.795 --> 01:48:23.463
COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND

01:48:23.530 --> 01:48:24.631
AGAIN CHRISTIAN IT'S ALREADY

01:48:24.698 --> 01:48:25.966
ALLUDED TO THIS IS THAT.

01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:26.833
THEY DON'T RECEIVE ENOUGH

01:48:26.900 --> 01:48:28.802
FINANCIALLY TO COVER THE TRUE

01:48:28.869 --> 01:48:30.637
COST OF ATTENDANCE -- AND THIS

01:48:30.704 --> 01:48:31.972
IS ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR LOW

01:48:32.038 --> 01:48:34.241
INCOME STUDENTS WITH ZERO

01:48:34.307 --> 01:48:35.809
EXPECTED FAMILY CONTRIBUTION --

01:48:35.876 --> 01:48:37.410
ACCESS TO PUBLIC BENEFITS IS

01:48:37.477 --> 01:48:39.312
OFTEN COMPLICATED AND IT'S HARD

01:48:39.379 --> 01:48:40.680
FOR STUDENTS TO NAVIGATE THE

01:48:40.747 --> 01:48:42.749
SYSTEM'S TO APPLY FOR AND

01:48:42.816 --> 01:48:44.217
RECEIVE THE BENEFITS FOR WHICH

01:48:44.284 --> 01:48:45.685
THEY'RE LIKELY ELIGIBLE.

01:48:45.752 --> 01:48:47.187
AND THEN THE COST OF LIVING IN

01:48:47.254 --> 01:48:49.256
CALIFORNIA IN A SPECIFICALLY

01:48:49.322 --> 01:48:50.757
AROUND HOUSING HAS INCREASED

01:48:50.824 --> 01:48:52.158
PRETTY DRAMATICALLY OVER THE

01:48:52.225 --> 01:48:53.260
LAST NUMBER OF YEARS.

01:48:53.326 --> 01:48:54.861
LET ME ASK A QUESTION ABOUT THE

01:48:54.928 --> 01:48:56.997
SURVEY I'M LOOKING AT OUR

01:48:57.063 --> 01:48:58.331
ANALYSIS AND I'M NOT A NUMBERS

01:48:58.398 --> 01:49:00.133
PERSON WHICH IS WHAT I ONCE WAS

01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:05.038
A LAWYER BUT SO THE SURVEY. 50%

01:49:05.105 --> 01:49:08.108
FOOD IN SECURE 60% HOUSING AND

01:49:08.174 --> 01:49:11.745
SECURE. 19% HOMELESS AND THEN --

01:49:11.811 --> 01:49:13.413
ANALYSIS INDICATES THE SURVEY

01:49:13.480 --> 01:49:15.815
FOUND THAT 22% OF FOOD IN SECURE

01:49:15.882 --> 01:49:17.784
STUDENTS RECEIVED [inaudible]

01:49:17.851 --> 01:49:21.154
SNAP BENEFITS HELP FRESH SCENT

01:49:21.221 --> 01:49:24.557
AND 8% WHO RECEIVED WHO

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:25.792
EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS

01:49:25.859 --> 01:49:27.761
RECEIVED HOUSING -- ASSISTANCE

01:49:27.827 --> 01:49:34.601
SO. 22% VERSUS 50% WHO REPORT

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:37.137
FOOD AND SECURITY AND 8% VERSUS

01:49:37.203 --> 01:49:38.705
19% WHO [inaudible]

01:49:38.772 --> 01:49:43.209
OF HOUSING AND SECURITY.

01:49:43.276 --> 01:49:44.978
THERE IS A DELTA.

01:49:45.045 --> 01:49:46.513
IF I'M READING IT RIGHT.

01:49:46.579 --> 01:49:47.981
WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CLOSE WHAT

01:49:48.048 --> 01:49:49.582
WHAT IT WHAT IT COUNTS FOR THE

01:49:49.649 --> 01:49:52.352
DELTA AND WHY AREN'T MORE OF THE?

01:49:52.419 --> 01:49:53.954
STUDENTS WHO.

01:49:54.020 --> 01:49:56.189
REPORT FOOD AND SECURITY --

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:58.158
RECEIVING SAT BENEFITS IS THERE

01:49:58.224 --> 01:49:59.693
A REASON WELL I THINK THAT THE

01:49:59.759 --> 01:50:03.129
HOUSING ISSUE THE THIS SNAP ON

01:50:03.196 --> 01:50:04.230
CASE OKAY HOW FRESH IS A

01:50:04.297 --> 01:50:07.100
COMPLICATED BENEFIT TO ACCESS

01:50:07.167 --> 01:50:09.569
AND IT'S BASED ON A NUMBER OF

01:50:09.636 --> 01:50:10.870
VARIABLES.

01:50:10.937 --> 01:50:13.106
HISTORICALLY STUDENTS TAKING SIX

01:50:13.173 --> 01:50:15.375
OR MORE UNITS WERE.

01:50:15.442 --> 01:50:17.010
ESSENTIALLY DEEMED IN ELIGIBLE

01:50:17.077 --> 01:50:18.278
UNLESS THEY COULD VERIFY THAT

01:50:18.345 --> 01:50:19.879
THEY WORKED TWENTY HOURS PER

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:22.048
WEEK ON AVERAGE EIGHTY HOURS PER

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:22.983
MONTH.

01:50:23.049 --> 01:50:24.351
AND FOR MANY OF THE STUDENTS

01:50:24.417 --> 01:50:27.053
THAT WAS CHALLENGING -- TO

01:50:27.120 --> 01:50:28.788
PROVIDE THAT CUT THE TYPE OF

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.757
INFORMATION TO THE COUNTIES AM

01:50:30.824 --> 01:50:32.559
BACK IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN A

01:50:32.625 --> 01:50:34.627
BILL PASSED WHICH WAS.

01:50:34.694 --> 01:50:35.228
NINETEEN THIRTY THAT ALLOW THE

01:50:35.295 --> 01:50:37.097
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES TO

01:50:37.163 --> 01:50:40.300
CREATE A LIST OF PROGRAMS.

01:50:40.367 --> 01:50:42.736
THAT WOULD -- NEARER EMPLOYMENT

01:50:42.802 --> 01:50:45.438
TRAINING PROGRAMS AND GIVE

01:50:45.505 --> 01:50:49.943
STUDENTS AN EXEMPTION. FOR THE

01:50:50.010 --> 01:50:51.611
TWENTY HOUR WORK WORK ROLE --

01:50:51.678 --> 01:50:52.245
AND SO THE DEPARTMENT IN

01:50:52.312 --> 01:50:53.146
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE NUMBER OF

01:50:53.213 --> 01:50:54.414
STAKEHOLDERS CAME UP WITH A

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:57.017
PRETTY COMPREHENSIVE LIST OF

01:50:57.083 --> 01:50:58.985
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND PROGRAMS

01:50:59.052 --> 01:51:00.120
AT FOUR YEAR SCHOOLS.

01:51:00.186 --> 01:51:01.654
THAT WOULD EXEMPT STUDENTS FROM

01:51:01.721 --> 01:51:03.656
HAVING TO WORK THIS TWENTY HOURS

01:51:03.723 --> 01:51:05.158
OR EIGHTY HOURS PER MONTH --

01:51:05.225 --> 01:51:09.095
IT'S OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:51:09.162 --> 01:51:11.131
THESE NEW PROVISIONS HAS BEEN

01:51:11.197 --> 01:51:12.432
SLOW.

01:51:12.499 --> 01:51:13.767
WHEN WAS IT?

01:51:13.833 --> 01:51:15.935
IT WELL THE BILL TO CREATE A

01:51:16.002 --> 01:51:18.438
WORK GROUP TO BEGIN WORKING ON

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:22.809
THE ISSUE -- PAST I BELIEVE IN.

01:51:22.876 --> 01:51:23.510
TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN NOW THE

01:51:23.576 --> 01:51:26.046
WORKGROUP DID THE WORK AND A AND

01:51:26.112 --> 01:51:27.814
A VERY ROBUST WORK TO COME UP

01:51:27.881 --> 01:51:29.349
WITH A VERY COMPREHENSIVE LIST

01:51:29.416 --> 01:51:30.650
BUT IT WAS JUST WITHIN THE LAST

01:51:30.717 --> 01:51:32.018
YEAR AND A HALF.

01:51:32.085 --> 01:51:33.820
THAT THAT INFORMATION HAS BEEN

01:51:33.887 --> 01:51:35.522
FORMALIZED AND DOCUMENTED AND

01:51:35.588 --> 01:51:37.290
ROLLED OUT TO THE COUNTY SO WHAT

01:51:37.357 --> 01:51:38.725
HAPPENS IS STUDENTS COME.

01:51:38.792 --> 01:51:40.160
THEY FILL OUT THEIR APPLICATION

01:51:40.226 --> 01:51:42.362
THEY GO TO THE COUNTY OR THE YOU

01:51:42.429 --> 01:51:43.997
KNOW GET ON THE PHONE WITH THE

01:51:44.064 --> 01:51:45.231
COUNTY FOR AN INTERVIEW.

01:51:45.298 --> 01:51:48.368
AND IF ALL -- AND AND OBVIOUSLY

01:51:48.435 --> 01:51:50.503
ELIGIBILITY IS COMPLICATED IT'S

01:51:50.570 --> 01:51:52.238
IT'S MULTI VARIANT THERE'S MANY

01:51:52.305 --> 01:51:53.506
MANY FACTORS THAT GO INTO

01:51:53.573 --> 01:51:54.941
DETERMINING YOUR ELIGIBILITY FOR

01:51:55.008 --> 01:51:56.643
CAL FRESH IT'S NOT JUST SIMPLY

01:51:56.709 --> 01:51:58.545
WHETHER YOUR STUDENT AND YOU

01:51:58.611 --> 01:52:00.213
MEET THE INCOME GUIDELINES RIGHT.

01:52:00.280 --> 01:52:01.514
IT'S A FULL.

01:52:01.581 --> 01:52:04.417
PROCESS THAT STUDENTS HAVE TO GO

01:52:04.484 --> 01:52:08.721
THROUGH -- I THINK IT TAKES TIME

01:52:08.788 --> 01:52:10.156
FOR CHANGES.

01:52:10.223 --> 01:52:13.827
OF THIS MAGNITUDE TO REALLY --

01:52:13.893 --> 01:52:16.763
COME FULL CIRCLE WITHTHE FRONT

01:52:16.830 --> 01:52:18.598
LINE WE CAN WORK ON THAT.

01:52:18.665 --> 01:52:20.767
THE YEAR AND A HALF LONG ENOUGH --

01:52:20.834 --> 01:52:23.269
I'D LIKE TO KNOW HOW WE MOVE

01:52:23.336 --> 01:52:24.804
THIS THING ALONG I MEAN IT'S CAL

01:52:24.871 --> 01:52:27.307
FRESHEN SNAPPER NOT WITHIN THE

01:52:27.373 --> 01:52:28.842
JURISDICTION OF THIS BUDGET

01:52:28.908 --> 01:52:30.810
SUBCOMMITTEE RIGHT I KNOW WHOSE

01:52:30.877 --> 01:52:32.011
COMMITTEE THEY ARE.

01:52:32.078 --> 01:52:33.680
I WOULD SAY JUST IN FAIRNESS TO

01:52:33.746 --> 01:52:34.914
THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES

01:52:34.981 --> 01:52:37.584
THEY'VE BEEN VERY VERY PROACTIVE

01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:38.718
ABOUT WORKING WITH THE DIFFERENT

01:52:38.785 --> 01:52:40.386
INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION

01:52:40.453 --> 01:52:43.056
IN CALIFORNIA -- THEY'VE REALLY

01:52:43.123 --> 01:52:45.024
ARE WORKING DILIGENTLY TOWARDS

01:52:45.091 --> 01:52:46.426
DEVELOPING STUDENT FRIENDLY

01:52:46.493 --> 01:52:48.361
POLICIES THAT STAY WITHIN THE

01:52:48.428 --> 01:52:49.195
GUIDELINES OF THE FEDERAL

01:52:49.262 --> 01:52:50.763
GOVERNMENT BECAUSE SNAP IS A

01:52:50.830 --> 01:52:53.266
FEDERALLY GOVERNED PROGRAM.

01:52:53.333 --> 01:52:55.034
IN TERMS OF ELIGIBILITY.

01:52:55.101 --> 01:52:55.635
CURTIS AND AND I WANT TO MAKE

01:52:55.702 --> 01:52:56.536
SURE THAT

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:57.971
EMPHASIZE THE DISTINCTION THERE

01:52:58.037 --> 01:53:00.440
PROBABLY TWO BUCKETS OF ISSUES

01:53:00.507 --> 01:53:02.375
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH ONE THAT

01:53:02.442 --> 01:53:04.811
IS UP DIFFICULT TO NAVIGATE THE

01:53:04.878 --> 01:53:06.246
ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS USED TO

01:53:06.312 --> 01:53:08.815
GET BENEFITS AND ARE IN NEED.

01:53:08.882 --> 01:53:09.516
COLLEEN AND COLLEAGUES ARE

01:53:09.582 --> 01:53:11.484
WORKING VERY HARD ON THAT THERE

01:53:11.551 --> 01:53:14.287
ARE ALSO POLICY PRESUMPTIONS

01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:15.855
THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR

01:53:15.922 --> 01:53:19.192
STUDENTS. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:53:19.259 --> 01:53:21.194
BENEFITS AND AND THE WORK THAT

01:53:21.261 --> 01:53:23.029
COLLINS MENTIONED WE HAVE MADE

01:53:23.096 --> 01:53:24.597
PROGRESS THERE BUT THERE IS.

01:53:24.664 --> 01:53:27.133
I THINK A A NEED TO THINK ABOUT

01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.968
POLICIES IN THIS AEA TWO ABOUT

01:53:29.035 --> 01:53:30.837
WHETHER WE HAVE HAD A THERE'S

01:53:30.904 --> 01:53:32.205
BEEN A LONG STANDING ASSUMPTION

01:53:32.272 --> 01:53:33.873
THAT IT WOULD BE -- STUDENTS IN

01:53:33.940 --> 01:53:35.308
GENERAL IF YOU'RE TAKING MORE

01:53:35.375 --> 01:53:36.943
THAN SIXTY UNITS WOULD NOT BE

01:53:37.010 --> 01:53:39.078
ELIGIBLE AND LESS YOU MET OTHER

01:53:39.145 --> 01:53:40.513
CRITERIA.

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:41.814
WELL I GUESS WHAT I'M ASKING IS

01:53:41.881 --> 01:53:43.583
I MEAN I'D LIKE A LIST OF THINGS

01:53:43.650 --> 01:53:47.187
THAT NEED TO BE FIXED I MEAN.

01:53:47.253 --> 01:53:48.188
2028%.

01:53:48.254 --> 01:53:50.490
MY MATH IS CORRECT CORRECT IS A

01:53:50.557 --> 01:53:52.625
LOT OF YOUNG PEOPLE OR NOT SO

01:53:52.692 --> 01:53:54.727
YOUNG PEOPLE.

01:53:54.794 --> 01:53:56.429
WHO ARE HUNGRY?

01:53:56.496 --> 01:53:58.097
AND YOU KNOW THAT'S JUST

01:53:58.164 --> 01:54:00.934
INTOLERABLE. TO ME AND IF WE

01:54:01.000 --> 01:54:05.572
NEED TO MAKE POLICY CHANGES --

01:54:05.638 --> 01:54:06.940
WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE POLICY

01:54:07.006 --> 01:54:08.875
CHANGES THAT WE CAN MAKE.

01:54:08.942 --> 01:54:10.410
IF WE NEED.

01:54:10.476 --> 01:54:12.645
TO INCREASE THE FUNDING TO THE

01:54:12.712 --> 01:54:14.180
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM.

01:54:14.247 --> 01:54:16.849
MOVING DOWN TO THE DISTRICTS.

01:54:16.916 --> 01:54:18.518
TO FUN NAVIGATORS TO HELP US

01:54:18.585 --> 01:54:21.688
STUDENTS NAVIGATE THIS PROCESS --

01:54:21.754 --> 01:54:23.022
THEN I'D LIKE TO KNOW ABOUT IT

01:54:23.089 --> 01:54:25.325
BECAUSE I THINK OF ALL THE

01:54:25.391 --> 01:54:27.427
THINGS THAT WE DEAL WITH UP HERE --

01:54:27.493 --> 01:54:29.028
INCLUDING ALL THOSE WHO WE'VE

01:54:29.095 --> 01:54:31.731
BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY --

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.166
HUNGER IN THE UNITED STATES OF

01:54:33.233 --> 01:54:35.635
AMERICA IS JUST NOT SOMETHING

01:54:35.702 --> 01:54:37.804
THAT I'M WILLING TO TOLERATE SO.

01:54:37.870 --> 01:54:38.805
AND I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE

01:54:38.871 --> 01:54:40.440
N. AS A BY THE WAY WITH THE

01:54:40.506 --> 01:54:42.075
HOUSING ASSISTANCE WE HAVEN'T.

01:54:42.141 --> 01:54:44.277
TALKED ABOUT THAT BUT I SUSPECT

01:54:44.344 --> 01:54:46.179
THERE'S A SIMILAR SET OF

01:54:46.246 --> 01:54:47.513
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT.

01:54:47.580 --> 01:54:49.782
THAT CREATE THIS GAP BETWEEN

01:54:49.849 --> 01:54:52.652
819% AND WE NEED TO FIX THAT.

01:54:52.719 --> 01:54:53.853
I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE

01:54:53.920 --> 01:54:55.054
LINK BETWEEN THIS AND THE

01:54:55.121 --> 01:54:57.290
PREVIOUS ITEM THAT BOTH FOOD AND

01:54:57.357 --> 01:54:59.359
HOUSING OR ITEMS IN THE COST OF

01:54:59.425 --> 01:55:00.593
ATTENDANCE THAT IS ADDRESSED BY

01:55:00.660 --> 01:55:01.694
FAN FINANCIAL AID.

01:55:01.761 --> 01:55:02.862
AS BETWEEN NINETY ONE WOULD

01:55:02.929 --> 01:55:05.465
CLOSE THAT GAP AND SO WE VERY

01:55:05.531 --> 01:55:06.599
FIRMLY BELIEVE THERE'S A LINK

01:55:06.666 --> 01:55:08.534
BETWEEN THESE ISSUES AND THAT

01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:08.801
STUDENTS.

01:55:08.868 --> 01:55:10.169
ARE WE CAN.

01:55:10.236 --> 01:55:11.571
HELP TO ADDRESS FOOD AND HOUSING

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:13.106
AND SECURITY BY EXPANDING

01:55:13.172 --> 01:55:15.141
FINANCIAL AID FOR STUDENTS RIGHT.

01:55:15.208 --> 01:55:17.277
AND I'M FULLY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

01:55:17.343 --> 01:55:20.280
USE OF THE GENERAL FUND FOR THAT

01:55:20.346 --> 01:55:21.247
PURPOSE BUT THERE'S OTHER MONEY --

01:55:21.314 --> 01:55:22.982
THAT I DO NOT INTEND TO LEAVE ON

01:55:23.049 --> 01:55:24.117
THE TABLE JUST BECAUSE THE

01:55:24.183 --> 01:55:25.084
BUREAUCRACY CAN'T MOVE FAST

01:55:25.151 --> 01:55:29.656
ENOUGH -- MAYBE. TO GET IT TO

01:55:29.722 --> 01:55:31.357
THE STUDENTS WHO NEEDED OR OR WE

01:55:31.424 --> 01:55:33.159
NEED TO MAKE POLICY CHANGES TO

01:55:33.226 --> 01:55:34.494
MAKE THOSE.

01:55:34.560 --> 01:55:36.296
STUDENTS WHO ARE EXPERIENCING

01:55:36.362 --> 01:55:37.997
FOOD AND HOUSING AND SECURITY.

01:55:38.064 --> 01:55:40.099
OF QUALIFIED TO RECEIVE THOSE

01:55:40.166 --> 01:55:41.567
BENEFITS.

01:55:41.634 --> 01:55:43.036
THANK YOU I THINK THE NAVIGATION

01:55:43.102 --> 01:55:45.338
PIECE ON PUBLIC BENEFIT AXIS IS

01:55:45.405 --> 01:55:45.938
IS.

01:55:46.005 --> 01:55:47.974
DEFINITELY WORTH RECOGNIZE OR

01:55:48.041 --> 01:55:51.477
WILL WE WILL VISIT REVISIT THAT --

01:55:51.544 --> 01:55:52.478
WHEN WE GET DOWN?

01:55:52.545 --> 01:55:54.514
TO BREAST TAX AROUND HERE I

01:55:54.580 --> 01:55:56.582
DIDN'T MEAN TO INTERRUPT YOU

01:55:56.649 --> 01:55:57.183
MELLOW THAT'S FINE [inaudible]

01:55:57.250 --> 01:56:00.720
NO APOLOGIES -- SO WE ARE

01:56:00.787 --> 01:56:02.121
SUPPORTIVE OF FINANCIALLY REFORM

01:56:02.188 --> 01:56:03.389
IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF STUDENT

01:56:03.456 --> 01:56:05.458
FRIENDLY POLICIES THANK YOU -- I

01:56:05.525 --> 01:56:06.459
DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER

01:56:06.526 --> 01:56:07.894
QUESTIONS ON THAT PARTICULAR

01:56:07.960 --> 01:56:10.096
ITEM IN REGARD TO THE HOUSING

01:56:10.163 --> 01:56:11.831
IT'S A SIMILAR SCENARIO WHERE

01:56:11.898 --> 01:56:15.501
THE RULES THAT GOVERN HOUSING

01:56:15.568 --> 01:56:18.871
AND HOMELESS RESOURCES -- THEY

01:56:18.938 --> 01:56:22.709
ARE TRADITIONALLY FOCUSED ON

01:56:22.775 --> 01:56:27.146
PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCISE ARE MORE --

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:29.515
OUR HOMELESS CHRONIC HOMELESS

01:56:29.582 --> 01:56:29.982
PEOPLE STUDENTS AREN'T

01:56:30.049 --> 01:56:31.050
NECESSARILY.

01:56:31.117 --> 01:56:34.387
IDENTIFIED AS HOMELESS THE THE

01:56:34.454 --> 01:56:36.589
THE ARE PEOPLE THAT ARE COUCH

01:56:36.656 --> 01:56:39.692
SURFING OR LISTENING OR SLEEPING

01:56:39.759 --> 01:56:40.259
IN THEIR CAR OR SLEEPING IN

01:56:40.326 --> 01:56:41.894
THEIR CAR.

01:56:41.961 --> 01:56:43.363
SO WHAT WE KNOW WITHIN THE I

01:56:43.429 --> 01:56:45.131
UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS A

01:56:45.198 --> 01:56:45.765
PROCESS HERE.

01:56:45.832 --> 01:56:48.601
FIRST FLOOR OF PURE.

01:56:48.668 --> 01:56:51.070
GOVERNMENT AGENCIES.

01:56:51.137 --> 01:56:51.704
IN TERMS OF WHAT YOU DO AND WHAT

01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:52.805
YOU.

01:56:52.872 --> 01:56:54.907
WHICH CAN DO WHAT YOU DO DO AND

01:56:54.974 --> 01:56:56.743
WHAT YOU CAN'T DO.

01:56:56.809 --> 01:56:58.678
BUT IS SOMEBODY GOING TO SUGGEST

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:00.880
SOME CHANGES TO THIS PROCESS SO

01:57:00.947 --> 01:57:02.882
WE CAN ADDRESS THESE ISSUES UP

01:57:02.949 --> 01:57:05.151
HERE OR ARE YOU ALL GOING TO

01:57:05.218 --> 01:57:07.286
RELY ON PEOPLE LIKE ME WHO MAY

01:57:07.353 --> 01:57:08.654
NOT KNOW ENOUGH.

01:57:08.721 --> 01:57:11.023
TO DESIGN A CHANGE WE DO HAVE

01:57:11.090 --> 01:57:13.860
AND WE DO HAVE A WORK GROUP THAT

01:57:13.926 --> 01:57:15.027
IS CALLED THE STUDENT

01:57:15.094 --> 01:57:17.363
ELIGIBILITY WORKGROUP AND IT

01:57:17.430 --> 01:57:18.564
CONSISTS OF A NUMBER OF

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:19.766
STAKEHOLDERS PEOPLE FROM THE

01:57:19.832 --> 01:57:21.134
FOOD BANK PEOPLE FROM ALL

01:57:21.200 --> 01:57:23.069
SECTORS OF EDUCATION PEOPLE FROM

01:57:23.136 --> 01:57:24.737
THE DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES.

01:57:24.804 --> 01:57:26.839
AND OUR SOLE CHARGE IS TO LOOK

01:57:26.906 --> 01:57:29.509
AT POLICIES AND PRACTICES AROUND

01:57:29.575 --> 01:57:30.777
HOW TO STUDENTS GET ON THE COW

01:57:30.843 --> 01:57:32.311
FRESH AND POSSIBLY OTHER PUBLIC

01:57:32.378 --> 01:57:35.214
BENEFITS -- AND SO I THINK THAT

01:57:35.281 --> 01:57:36.649
GROUP WOULD BE THE BEST GROUP TO

01:57:36.716 --> 01:57:37.717
TRY TO FORWARD SOME

01:57:37.784 --> 01:57:39.318
RECOMMENDATIONS IF.

01:57:39.385 --> 01:57:41.421
I LOOK FORWARD TO RECEIVING THEM.

01:57:41.487 --> 01:57:42.722
WHETHER THEIR BUDGET RELATED OR

01:57:42.789 --> 01:57:44.023
NOT IF THEY'RE NOT I'LL PASS

01:57:44.090 --> 01:57:45.391
THEMON TO THE PEOPLE WHO DEAL

01:57:45.458 --> 01:57:46.793
WITH THOSE ISSUES AND IF THEIR

01:57:46.859 --> 01:57:48.795
BUDGET RELATED -- I KNOW WERE TO

01:57:48.861 --> 01:57:49.529
TAKE THOSE [inaudible]

01:57:49.595 --> 01:57:52.331
THANK YOU.

01:57:52.398 --> 01:57:54.333
SO I HAVE ANOTHER ITEM ON NOT

01:57:54.400 --> 01:57:55.868
TRIVIALIZE YOU TO MOVE FORWARD

01:57:55.935 --> 01:57:57.403
WITH THAT -- SO FOR MENTAL

01:57:57.470 --> 01:57:58.771
HEALTH SERVICES JUST A LITTLE

01:57:58.838 --> 01:57:59.839
BIT OF BACKGROUND INFORMATION

01:57:59.906 --> 01:58:01.407
CURRENTLY ACROSS THE COMMUNITY

01:58:01.474 --> 01:58:03.876
COLLEGE SYSTEM WE HAVE.

01:58:03.943 --> 01:58:04.777
SEVENTY A BRICK AND MORTAR

01:58:04.844 --> 01:58:06.446
HEALTH CENTERS -- MANY OF WHOM

01:58:06.512 --> 01:58:08.014
PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:09.882
TO STUDENTS -- SOME OF THE

01:58:09.949 --> 01:58:11.317
COLLEGES HAVE STANDALONE

01:58:11.384 --> 01:58:13.486
PSYCHOLOGICAL SERVICES AND BASED

01:58:13.553 --> 01:58:16.789
ON RESEARCH THAT WE CONDUCTED IN --

01:58:16.856 --> 01:58:17.523
TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN PRIOR TO

01:58:17.590 --> 01:58:19.158
THE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS

01:58:19.225 --> 01:58:20.593
BECAUSE WE DID RECEIVE.

01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:21.894
TEN WE RECEIVED FOUR AND A HALF

01:58:21.961 --> 01:58:23.563
MILLION IN THE SEVENTEEN

01:58:23.629 --> 01:58:25.198
EIGHTEEN BUDGET AND TEN MILLION

01:58:25.264 --> 01:58:27.233
IN EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET TO

01:58:27.300 --> 01:58:30.102
PROVIDE SERVICES TO STUDENTS --

01:58:30.169 --> 01:58:31.971
BUT JUST AS A LITTLE BACKGROUND --

01:58:32.038 --> 01:58:33.306
SOME OF THE COLLEGES HAVE

01:58:33.372 --> 01:58:34.640
STANDALONE PSYCHOLOGICAL

01:58:34.707 --> 01:58:37.510
SERVICES ON CAMPUS -- BASED ON

01:58:37.577 --> 01:58:38.611
RESEARCH THAT WE DID WE

01:58:38.678 --> 01:58:39.912
IDENTIFIED NINETY OF THE

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:41.080
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT WERE

01:58:41.147 --> 01:58:43.049
OFFERING SOME LEVEL OF MENTAL

01:58:43.115 --> 01:58:43.583
HEALTH SERVICES TO THEIR

01:58:43.649 --> 01:58:46.385
STUDENTS -- IN SEVENTEEN EIGHTY

SUICIDE PREVENTION AND EARLY

ADMINISTRATIVE DELAYS IN GETTING

THE CONTRACTS IN PLACE THOUGH

CURRENTLY ALL TWENTY SEVEN OF

01:59:45.811 --> 01:59:47.079
THOSE PARTICIPATING COLLEGES.

01:59:47.146 --> 01:59:48.981
ARE WELL INTO OPERATIONAL ICING

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:51.217
THEIR FUNDS.

01:59:51.284 --> 01:59:54.320
AND FOR THE EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:56.289
FUNDS WE DISTRIBUTED THOSE TWO

01:59:57.623 --> 01:59:59.091
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THROUGH OUR

01:59:59.158 --> 02:00:00.860

STUDENTS AND TO CREATE FORMAL

02:00:11.904 --> 02:00:13.806
PARTNERSHIPS WITH THE COUNTY

02:00:13.873 --> 02:00:17.109
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO -- I WOULD

02:00:17.176 --> 02:00:18.511
SAY ALL THE COLLEGES HAVE

02:00:18.578 --> 02:00:20.880
PROTOCOL -- REGARDING CRISIS

02:00:20.947 --> 02:00:22.048
INTERVENTION FOR STUDENTS

02:00:22.114 --> 02:00:23.583
PRESENTING WITH IMMEDIATE MENTAL

02:00:23.649 --> 02:00:25.084
HEALTH CRISIS.

02:00:25.151 --> 02:00:26.385
OF THE MAJORITY OF THE COLLEGES

02:00:26.452 --> 02:00:29.555
HAVE ESTABLISHED TEAMS ON CAMPUS

02:00:29.622 --> 02:00:31.457
TO ADDRESS STUDENTS IN NEED --

02:00:31.524 --> 02:00:32.758
THEY'RE CALLED BEHAVIORAL

02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:34.393
INTERVENTION TEAMS ARE CRISIS

02:00:34.460 --> 02:00:38.364
INTERVENTION TEAMS -- THEN I'M

02:00:38.431 --> 02:00:40.333
NOT SURE A WAIT AND SEE IF YOU

02:00:40.399 --> 02:00:42.301
HAVE QUESTIONS I HAVE ANSWERS TO

02:00:42.368 --> 02:00:42.935
WHAT I THINK MIGHT BE QUESTIONS

02:00:43.002 --> 02:00:45.137
BUT I REALIZE THAT EACH

02:00:45.204 --> 02:00:46.372
COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS A

02:00:46.439 --> 02:00:48.007
STANDALONE AND DISTURBED AS A

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:51.477
STANDALONE ENTITY S. HERE.

02:00:51.544 --> 02:00:52.845
THE THE THE COLLEGES MAKE HEALTH

02:00:52.912 --> 02:00:54.847
INSURANCE AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY

02:00:54.914 --> 02:00:57.183
COLLEGE STUDENTS TO SOME OF THEM

02:00:57.249 --> 02:00:58.718
ALL OF THEM NONE OF THEM.

02:00:58.784 --> 02:01:00.319
IT COVERS MENTAL HEALTH BUT HAS

02:01:00.386 --> 02:01:01.887
NO HEALTH COMPONENT TO IT THE

02:01:01.954 --> 02:01:04.690
COLLEGES DO NOT OFFER INSURANCE

02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:06.859
THE THE THERE'S A THEY DO WORK

02:01:06.926 --> 02:01:08.394
WITH VENDORS WHO CAN PROVIDE

02:01:08.461 --> 02:01:09.729
INSURANCE AND BUT THAT'S

02:01:09.795 --> 02:01:10.796
PRIMARILY TARGETING

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:12.198
INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS WHO ARE

02:01:12.264 --> 02:01:13.265
REQUIRED TO HAVE HEALTH

02:01:13.332 --> 02:01:14.367
INSURANCE.

02:01:14.433 --> 02:01:15.835
AS PART OF THEIR ENROLLMENT THE

02:01:15.901 --> 02:01:17.370
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

02:01:17.436 --> 02:01:20.306
I THINK THE SCHOOLS -- DO WORK

02:01:20.373 --> 02:01:21.440
WITH THE STUDENTS TO HELP THEM

02:01:21.507 --> 02:01:24.644
GET ENROLLED IN A CGA AND MEDIC

02:01:24.710 --> 02:01:25.544
COW.

02:01:25.611 --> 02:01:28.848
BUT WE DON'T MAN DATE THAT --

02:01:28.914 --> 02:01:30.216
THAT THEY HAVE INSURANCE I MEAN

02:01:30.282 --> 02:01:31.684
THE GOVERNMENT MANDATES THAT

02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:32.618
THEY HAVE INSURANCE BUT THE

02:01:32.685 --> 02:01:34.620
SCHOOLS DON'T.

02:01:34.687 --> 02:01:35.888
AND I REALIZE IT'S DIFFICULT

02:01:35.955 --> 02:01:38.624
BECAUSE OF THE ARCHITECTURE OF

02:01:38.691 --> 02:01:39.825
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN

02:01:39.892 --> 02:01:41.394
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:42.962
INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS WITH LOCAL

02:01:43.029 --> 02:01:44.296
GOVERNING BOARDS AND THIS AND

02:01:44.363 --> 02:01:46.032
THAT BUT IS THERE ANY

02:01:46.098 --> 02:01:48.034
CENTRALIZED COLLECTION OF DATA

02:01:48.100 --> 02:01:49.402
THAT THE ENABLES THE SYSTEM

02:01:49.468 --> 02:01:51.504
OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE TO EVALUATE

02:01:51.570 --> 02:01:53.372
WHETHER THE PROVISION.

02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:55.307
OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- THE

02:01:55.374 --> 02:01:57.276
NUMBER OF PROVIDERS ON CAMPUS

02:01:57.343 --> 02:02:00.613
THE WAIT TIMES -- AND ALL THE

02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.715
REST OF THAT THAT WE TAKE A LOOK

02:02:02.782 --> 02:02:04.950
AT AND YOU SEE IN THE C. ISSUES

02:02:05.017 --> 02:02:06.152
SEE ISSUE SYSTEM.

02:02:06.218 --> 02:02:07.853
THE THE THE THE THE DATA

02:02:07.920 --> 02:02:09.655
INDICATES THAT THERE IS A THERE

02:02:09.722 --> 02:02:11.023
ARE PROGRAMS IN PLACE THAT ARE

02:02:11.090 --> 02:02:12.425
MEETING THE NEEDS OF YOUR

02:02:12.491 --> 02:02:15.361
STUDENTS HOW HOW DO WE DO THAT --

02:02:15.428 --> 02:02:16.896
FOR QUESTION -- IT'S A FAIR

02:02:16.962 --> 02:02:18.130
QUESTION I WOULD SAY WE ARE NOT

02:02:18.197 --> 02:02:19.799
DOING IT SYSTEMATICALLY TODAY WE

02:02:19.865 --> 02:02:22.535
HAVE FOLKS -- YOU KNOW WHO IT

02:02:22.601 --> 02:02:24.837
AND WE HAVE A REGULAR

02:02:24.904 --> 02:02:27.606
EXPENDITURE REPORTING SO IN MANY

02:02:27.673 --> 02:02:29.508
WAYS WE WOULD KNOW THE TYPES OF

02:02:29.575 --> 02:02:31.243
RESOURCES THAT ARE BEING PUT ON

02:02:31.310 --> 02:02:32.678
DIFFERENT PARTS OF CAMPUSES.

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:34.413
WE KNOW THE TYPES OF EMPLOYEES

02:02:34.480 --> 02:02:37.216
THAT ARE SPREAD ACROSS CAMPUSES.

02:02:37.283 --> 02:02:39.318
WE HAPPENED HISTORICALLY DONE

02:02:39.385 --> 02:02:40.152
THE ANALYSIS.

02:02:40.219 --> 02:02:45.458
TO OB. TO LINK THAT TO STUDENT.

02:02:45.524 --> 02:02:47.626
TO STUDENT OUTCOMES THAT ARE OF

02:02:47.693 --> 02:02:48.160
INTEREST TO US OR AT LEAST

02:02:48.227 --> 02:02:49.195
STUDENT.

02:02:49.261 --> 02:02:50.996
EXPERIENCES THAT ARE INTEREST OF

02:02:51.063 --> 02:02:52.665
INTEREST TO US AND WE PROBABLY

02:02:52.732 --> 02:02:54.400
DON'T HAVE THE DATA ON A

02:02:54.467 --> 02:02:55.835
SYSTEMATIC BASIS.

02:02:55.901 --> 02:02:58.504
OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AT A

02:02:58.571 --> 02:02:59.705
AT A LEVEL THAT WOULD ALLOW US

02:02:59.772 --> 02:03:01.540
TO DO THAT IN WAYS THAT WOULD BE

02:03:01.607 --> 02:03:05.511
INFORMATIVE TO POLICY MAKERS --

02:03:05.578 --> 02:03:06.479
HERE THINK IT IS.

02:03:06.545 --> 02:03:07.713
IN CONJUNCTION WITH VARIOUS

02:03:07.780 --> 02:03:09.281
FUNDING SOURCES WE'VE ASKED FOR

02:03:09.348 --> 02:03:12.118
DATA -- BUT I THINK THAT'S

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:13.886
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE

02:03:13.953 --> 02:03:14.820
WOULD BE HAPPY TO A CAN OF

02:03:14.887 --> 02:03:16.322
CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH YOU

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:17.256
ABOUT ABOUT HOW WE DO IT HOW

02:03:17.323 --> 02:03:18.791
WHAT WHAT DATA SHOULD WE BE

02:03:18.858 --> 02:03:20.059
COLLECTING.

02:03:20.126 --> 02:03:21.894
MORE SYSTEMATICALLY TO GIVE US

02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:22.928
THE TYPES OF INSECTS THAT WOULD

02:03:22.995 --> 02:03:24.597
INFORM YOUR YOUR WORK MEANS SO

02:03:24.663 --> 02:03:28.100
IF IF FOR EXAMPLE IF THE IF WE

02:03:28.167 --> 02:03:30.269
WERE TO ASK DO YOU THINK THAT

02:03:30.336 --> 02:03:32.404
GIVEN THE THE INVESTMENT THAT

02:03:32.471 --> 02:03:33.706
THE STATE MAKES IN THE COMMUNITY

02:03:33.773 --> 02:03:34.974
COLLEGE SYSTEM THAT.

02:03:35.040 --> 02:03:36.909
WE'RE DOING ENOUGH TO ADDRESS

02:03:36.976 --> 02:03:38.277
THE MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS AND

02:03:38.344 --> 02:03:39.645
ISSUES OF OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:03:39.712 --> 02:03:41.747
STUDENTS.

02:03:41.814 --> 02:03:43.315
AS A QUESTION AND THE ANSWER

02:03:43.382 --> 02:03:45.084
WOULD BE I THINK WE HAVE LOTS OF

02:03:45.151 --> 02:03:47.219
EVIDENCE THAT -- OUR COMMUNITY

02:03:47.286 --> 02:03:48.821
COLLEGE STUDENTS ARE FACING

02:03:48.888 --> 02:03:50.689
ISSUES RELATED TO MENTAL HEALTH

02:03:50.756 --> 02:03:54.059
I DON'T THINK WE BUT I I I DEALT

02:03:54.126 --> 02:03:55.227
TO THE QUESTION OF ARE WE DOING

02:03:55.294 --> 02:03:57.696
ENOUGH I DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE --

02:03:57.763 --> 02:03:59.832
A GOOD SENSE -- OVER LONG

02:03:59.899 --> 02:04:01.634
PERIODS OF TIME -- OUTSIDE OF

02:04:01.700 --> 02:04:03.869
THE DATA THAT COLLEEN COLLECTS

02:04:03.936 --> 02:04:06.338
AND AND I WE'VE SHARED -- ABOUT --

02:04:06.405 --> 02:04:08.140
WHAT TRENDS LOOK LIKE WHAT

02:04:08.207 --> 02:04:09.875
SPECIFICALLY?

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:12.144
VARIES ACROSS COLLEGES I'M SO I

02:04:12.211 --> 02:04:13.445
THINK IT TODAY.

02:04:13.512 --> 02:04:15.381
WE ARE TRYING TO YOU KNOW WE TRY

02:04:15.447 --> 02:04:16.849
TO MAKE DO WITH THE INFORMATION

02:04:16.916 --> 02:04:18.818
THAT WE HAVE BUT CERTAINLY -- I

02:04:18.884 --> 02:04:19.318
DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE

02:04:19.385 --> 02:04:20.519
SYSTEMATIC ANSWERS FOR THOSE

02:04:20.586 --> 02:04:22.087
KINDS OF QUESTIONS FOR EXAMPLE

02:04:22.154 --> 02:04:24.790
WITH THE EXTREME AND DO WE KNOW

02:04:24.857 --> 02:04:25.157
SUICIDE RATES.

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:27.726
WE DO NOT.

02:04:27.793 --> 02:04:30.830
SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS MEAN

02:04:30.896 --> 02:04:32.164
THAT THERE'S A HIGH DEGREE OF

02:04:32.231 --> 02:04:33.966
STRESS IN EDUCATION AT ALL

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:35.301
LEVELS FROM.

02:04:35.367 --> 02:04:39.138
I GUESS ALMOST PRE.

02:04:39.205 --> 02:04:40.539
TO THE END OF THE LINE ON IT AT

02:04:40.606 --> 02:04:45.110
HIGHER EDUCATION -- WE'RE IN IN

02:04:45.177 --> 02:04:46.545
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SETTING IT

02:04:46.612 --> 02:04:49.548
SOUNDS LIKE WE AND I'M INCLUDING

02:04:49.615 --> 02:04:51.050
THE LEGISLATURE IN THIS

02:04:51.116 --> 02:04:52.451
CONVERSATION.

02:04:52.518 --> 02:04:54.420
WE ARE SORT OF ALLOWING OR

02:04:54.486 --> 02:04:57.590
FORCING -- STUDENTS AND STUDENT

02:04:57.656 --> 02:05:00.492
GROUPS. TO INTERACT WITH LOCALLY

02:05:00.559 --> 02:05:02.194
ELECTED BOARDS TO TRY TO GET

02:05:02.261 --> 02:05:04.263
LOCALLY ELECTED BOARDS TO DO THE

02:05:04.330 --> 02:05:05.931
RIGHT THING.

02:05:05.998 --> 02:05:09.068
COLLECT DATA RESPONDED DATA.

02:05:09.134 --> 02:05:10.769
INPUT PROGRAMS IN PLACE AND

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.705
SERVE A PIECEMEAL BASIS AROUND

02:05:12.771 --> 02:05:14.206
THE STATE AND AND I DO

02:05:14.273 --> 02:05:15.908
UNDERSTAND THE ARCHITECTURE OF

02:05:15.975 --> 02:05:16.909
THE SYSTEM THAT WE'RE DEALING

02:05:16.976 --> 02:05:19.044
WITH BUT PERHAPS WE OUGHT TO

02:05:19.111 --> 02:05:21.480
HAVE A CONVERSATION UP HERE.

02:05:21.547 --> 02:05:22.982
ABOUT A MORE REGULARIZED

02:05:23.048 --> 02:05:24.516
APPROACH.

02:05:24.583 --> 02:05:25.818
TO MENTAL HEALTH AND COMMUNITY

02:05:25.885 --> 02:05:27.753
COLLEGE CAMPUSES AND OBVIOUSLY

02:05:27.820 --> 02:05:28.487
THAT.

02:05:28.554 --> 02:05:30.189
AS WITH EVERYTHING ELSE INCLUDES

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:32.858
MONEY BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:35.060
HAVING SOME SORT OF DATA SYSTEMS

02:05:35.127 --> 02:05:36.996
SO WE CAN FIGURE OUT WHO'S DOING

02:05:37.062 --> 02:05:38.163
WHAT WHERE.

02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:40.799
WE'RE DEFICIENCIES OCCUR ARE ARE

02:05:40.866 --> 02:05:43.335
OCCURRING AND HOW WE DIRECT

02:05:43.402 --> 02:05:46.305
MONEY -- TO THOSE AREAS TO THOSE

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:48.073
DISTRICTS TO THOSE REGIONS THAT

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:48.807
HAVE.

02:05:48.874 --> 02:05:50.509
NEEDS THAT ARE BEING MET AND

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:52.544
IT'S SORT OF HARD TO ADDRESS

02:05:52.611 --> 02:05:54.146
THAT ISSUE.

02:05:54.213 --> 02:05:55.581
IF WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE FOR OR

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:56.615
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEMS

02:05:56.682 --> 02:05:58.550
ARE AND THAT'S NOT YOUR FAULT WE

02:05:58.617 --> 02:06:00.219
PROBABLY HAVEN'T FUNDED YOU. TO

02:06:00.286 --> 02:06:02.721
TO DO THAT I'D LIKE TO TALK TO

02:06:02.788 --> 02:06:04.623
THE SYSTEM AND THE CHANCELLOR

02:06:04.690 --> 02:06:06.058
ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN

02:06:06.125 --> 02:06:09.495
ORDER TO GET A BETTER HANDLE.

02:06:09.561 --> 02:06:11.730
ON A MENTAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH

02:06:11.797 --> 02:06:13.399
OF OUR STUDENTS AND OUR OWNER

02:06:13.465 --> 02:06:15.167
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAMPUSES.

02:06:15.234 --> 02:06:16.635
AND WHAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IF

02:06:16.702 --> 02:06:19.405
ANY WE NEED TO DIRECT DOWN THERE.

02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:20.639
TO ADDRESS THOSE WERE DOING IT

02:06:20.706 --> 02:06:23.342
WAS THE ISSUE WERE DOING THE UC

02:06:23.409 --> 02:06:24.944
MEDICALLY DIFFERENT SYSTEMS.

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:27.279
DIFFERENT ARCHITECTURE EASIER TO

02:06:27.346 --> 02:06:28.113
GET DATA.

02:06:28.180 --> 02:06:29.548
BUT I DO THINK WE NEED TO TAKE A

02:06:29.615 --> 02:06:31.350
LOOK AT THIS AND I THINK WORKING

02:06:31.417 --> 02:06:34.520
WITH -- WITH THOSE DISTRICTS UP

02:06:34.586 --> 02:06:35.387
FOR US WOULD BE AN IMPORTANT

02:06:35.454 --> 02:06:36.855
CONVERSATION ALSO TO UNDERSTAND

02:06:36.922 --> 02:06:38.457
WHAT THAT CONVERSATION IS

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:40.326
LOCALLY WHAT THE PRESSURES --

02:06:40.392 --> 02:06:42.094
DISTRICTS ARE FACING AND AND HOW

02:06:42.161 --> 02:06:44.196
DO WE MAKE THIS A PRIORITY FOR

02:06:44.263 --> 02:06:45.831
DISTRICTS TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO

02:06:45.898 --> 02:06:47.199
ADDRESS -- AT THE LOCAL LEVELS

02:06:47.266 --> 02:06:48.167
RIGHT.

02:06:48.233 --> 02:06:49.635
THERE'S A FEW ITEMS THAT I JUST

02:06:49.702 --> 02:06:50.970
WANT TO SHARE AND I DON'T HAVE

02:06:51.036 --> 02:06:52.137
THAT IN FRONT OF ME BUT WE DO

02:06:52.204 --> 02:06:55.174
HAVE SOME STATISTICS FROM RAND --

02:06:55.240 --> 02:06:57.343
WHO DID A STUDY OF OUR

02:06:57.409 --> 02:06:58.210
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:06:58.277 --> 02:06:59.712
STUDENT HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH WAS

02:06:59.778 --> 02:07:00.612
FUNDED THROUGH THE MEDICAL

02:07:00.679 --> 02:07:02.147
SERVICE ACT PROP SIXTY THREE

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:02.915
DOLLARS?

02:07:02.982 --> 02:07:05.217
SO WE CAN PROVIDE SOME DATA IT'S

02:07:05.284 --> 02:07:06.852
NOT SYSTEM MY DATA.

02:07:06.919 --> 02:07:09.221
BUT IT DOES REFLECT I'M PRETTY

02:07:09.288 --> 02:07:10.622
HIGH RATES OF ANXIETY AND

02:07:10.689 --> 02:07:12.191
DEPRESSION THAT ARE IMPEDING THE

02:07:12.257 --> 02:07:13.859
STUDENTS ACADEMICALLY SO THAT

02:07:13.926 --> 02:07:16.462
MIGHT BE HELPFUL -- I WOULD SAY

02:07:16.528 --> 02:07:18.163
ALSO COULD PROVIDE THAT DECIDE

02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:20.032
WHERE WOULD I GO TO REVIEWING --

02:07:20.099 --> 02:07:21.533
AND SOMETHING ELSE I THINK IT'S

02:07:21.600 --> 02:07:22.634
WORTH NOTING THAT THERE IS AN

02:07:22.701 --> 02:07:25.004
ASSEMBLY BILL RIGHT NOW 1-689-

02:07:25.070 --> 02:07:26.238
WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR THE USE OF

02:07:26.305 --> 02:07:27.973
PROPS SIXTY THREE FUNDS

02:07:28.040 --> 02:07:30.676
SPECIFICALLY FOR ALL -- THREE

02:07:30.743 --> 02:07:32.911
SEGMENTS OF HIGHER EDUCATION AND

02:07:32.978 --> 02:07:35.647
SO PREVIOUSLY YOU KNOW BACK IN

02:07:35.714 --> 02:07:36.281
TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WE DID HAVE

02:07:36.348 --> 02:07:38.283
GRANT MAKING PROCESS USING PROPS

02:07:38.350 --> 02:07:39.752
SIXTY THREE DOLLARS SPECIFICALLY

02:07:39.818 --> 02:07:41.420
FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS --

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:42.654
I JUST THINK IT'S IT'S THE

02:07:42.721 --> 02:07:43.889
IMPORTANT.

02:07:43.956 --> 02:07:47.659
THING TO LOOK AT THAT ARE AN HSA

02:07:47.726 --> 02:07:48.827
FUNDS ARE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE

02:07:48.894 --> 02:07:52.898
ACT FUNDS -- DOING THEIR SHARE --

02:07:52.965 --> 02:07:54.299
TO SUPPORT CAN BE COLLEGE

02:07:54.366 --> 02:07:55.868
STUDENTS IN GENERAL AND SO WE

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:59.972
HAVEN'T HAD THAT FUNDING FOR

02:08:00.039 --> 02:08:01.306
MANY MANY YEARS AND SO IT'S

02:08:01.373 --> 02:08:03.442
ASSEMBLY BILL SIXTEEN EIGHTY

02:08:03.509 --> 02:08:04.076
NINE WELL OF COURSE BUT BUT THE

02:08:04.143 --> 02:08:04.343
I THINK.

02:08:04.410 --> 02:08:05.511
MONEY IS A GOOD THING RIGHT AND

02:08:05.577 --> 02:08:07.312
THAT'S GOOD BUT I THINK WE NEED

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:09.114
TO HAVE THE PROCESS IN THE

02:08:09.181 --> 02:08:10.149
ARCHITECTURE IN PLACE.

02:08:10.215 --> 02:08:11.617
TO ASSESS WHERE THE MONEY'S

02:08:11.683 --> 02:08:13.552
GOING MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO

02:08:13.619 --> 02:08:14.620
THE RIGHT PLACE.

02:08:14.686 --> 02:08:15.888
GATHER SOME DATA ON HOW IT'S

02:08:15.954 --> 02:08:17.589
BEING UTILIZED AND THEN MAKE

02:08:17.656 --> 02:08:20.259
ADJUSTMENTS. TO ENSURE THAT THE

02:08:20.325 --> 02:08:21.660
THE MONEY'S BEING DIRECTED TO

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:23.062
THE PROBLEM AREAS THAT'S ONE OF

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:24.530
THE ISSUES WE HAVE WITH PROP

02:08:24.596 --> 02:08:26.265
SIXTY THREE RIGHT NOW.

02:08:26.331 --> 02:08:28.901
IN ALLOCATION TO COUNTIES.

02:08:28.967 --> 02:08:30.569
SOME SPEND IT SOME DON'T SOME

02:08:30.636 --> 02:08:32.137
HAVE NINE HUNDRED MILLION IN

02:08:32.204 --> 02:08:34.106
RESERVE SOME OF A HUNDRED AND

02:08:34.173 --> 02:08:35.707
THIRTY SIX MILLION IN RESERVE.

02:08:35.774 --> 02:08:37.843
SO THAT'S THE SITUATION THAT WE

02:08:37.910 --> 02:08:39.645
DON'T WANT TO REPLICATE.

02:08:39.711 --> 02:08:42.314
IN IN HIGHER EDUCATION WE NEED

02:08:42.381 --> 02:08:43.749
TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MONEY GOES

02:08:43.816 --> 02:08:45.417
DOWN AND FIXES PROBLEMS AND YEAH

02:08:45.484 --> 02:08:46.952
AND AND THIS IS NOT COMING FROM

02:08:47.019 --> 02:08:49.154
A PERSPECTIVE OF OF DATA AND

02:08:49.221 --> 02:08:50.422
RESEARCH IT IS COMING FROM A

02:08:50.489 --> 02:08:51.757
PERSPECTIVE OF HAVING WORKED

02:08:51.824 --> 02:08:53.092

02:08:58.864 --> 02:08:59.465

WORKS AS WELL IS THE DEMAND SIDE

02:20:06.598 --> 02:20:07.766
FOR EXAMPLE IN THE IN THE

02:20:07.832 --> 02:20:09.400

THE DASHBOARD AND I SEE THAT.

02:33:23.894 --> 02:33:25.062

02:45:52.742 --> 02:45:54.210
BUT IT DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY

02:45:54.277 --> 02:45:56.513
AT THIS POINT T. DISAGGREGATED

02:45:56.579 --> 02:45:58.748
DATA BY FUNDING SOURCE IF YOU'RE

02:45:58.815 --> 02:46:00.216
ASKING SPECIFICALLY.

02:46:00.283 --> 02:46:01.818
HOW DO WE KNOW WHICH STUDENTS

02:46:01.885 --> 02:46:04.187
BENEFITED FROM SEATED WE

02:46:04.254 --> 02:46:05.388
WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO TELL YOU

02:46:05.455 --> 02:46:07.190
THAT EXCEPT WE DID WE JUST

02:46:07.257 --> 02:46:08.725
STARTED TO IMPLEMENT A SURVEY

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:11.861
SYSTEM -- WITH OUR WITH OUR

02:46:11.928 --> 02:46:13.797
GRANTEES AND THAT'S WHERE THIS

02:46:13.863 --> 02:46:17.934
DATA CAME FROM -- WE DID A FOR

02:46:18.001 --> 02:46:18.835
FIRST WE DID A ADAM.

02:46:18.902 --> 02:46:22.205
A SURVEY TO DO ENROLLMENT DATA

02:46:22.272 --> 02:46:23.973
TO SEE WHAT TYPES OF OUTCOMES

02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:25.642
THAT WE DID GET WHAT WE COULD

02:46:25.709 --> 02:46:28.111
GET -- AND SO THIS IS JUST THE

02:46:28.178 --> 02:46:29.479
ENROLLMENT DATA AND THEN WE'LL

02:46:29.546 --> 02:46:31.481
BE ROLLING OUT ANOTHER SURVEY TO

02:46:31.548 --> 02:46:33.483
OUR FOLKS SPECIFICALLY WITH THE

02:46:33.550 --> 02:46:36.186
TAG -- TO GET TO GET THAT DATA

02:46:36.252 --> 02:46:38.188
AS WELL WE ALMOST NEED A SYSTEM

02:46:38.254 --> 02:46:39.356
THAT WORKS WITHOUT THE NEED FOR

02:46:39.422 --> 02:46:41.658
SURVEYS RIGHT EXACTLY SO I MEAN

02:46:41.725 --> 02:46:43.593
THE THE EXISTING SYSTEM THAT WE

02:46:43.660 --> 02:46:44.894
HAVE DOES IT IT.

02:46:44.961 --> 02:46:45.929
IT CAN TELL YOU HOW MANY

02:46:45.995 --> 02:46:47.664
STUDENTS ARE ENROLLED K. THROUGH

02:46:47.731 --> 02:46:49.099
TWELVE I GUESS HER AND ROLLED IN

02:46:49.165 --> 02:46:50.100
C. T..

02:46:50.166 --> 02:46:51.701
CAN IT TELL YOU HOW MANY OF

02:46:51.768 --> 02:46:54.137
THOSE STUDENTS SECURE JOBS IN

02:46:54.204 --> 02:46:55.705
THE FIELD IN THE C. T. THAT DOES

02:46:55.772 --> 02:46:58.341
NOT IT DOES NOT GIVE US THE

02:46:58.408 --> 02:46:59.409
FOLLOW UP.

02:46:59.476 --> 02:47:02.245
ON THE WEATHER OF SOMEBODY WHO'S

02:47:02.312 --> 02:47:04.514
IN A MANUFACTURING RELATED C. T.

02:47:04.581 --> 02:47:06.616
PROGRAM WINDS UP AS A PRIEST AT

02:47:06.683 --> 02:47:08.351
STARBUCKS OR WHETHER THEY'RE

02:47:08.418 --> 02:47:09.719
ACTUALLY INTO.

02:47:09.786 --> 02:47:11.688
WE DO FIRMS ARE PERFECT FOR

02:47:11.755 --> 02:47:13.990
PERKINS WE DO -- BECAUSE THAT'S

02:47:14.057 --> 02:47:15.458
TRADITIONAL DATA WE'VE ALWAYS

02:47:15.525 --> 02:47:18.595
COLLECTED FOR PERKINS -- BUT NOT

02:47:18.661 --> 02:47:20.964
FOR STATEWIDE CT.

02:47:21.030 --> 02:47:21.765
YES SIR I DID ME I MEAN TO CUT

02:47:21.831 --> 02:47:22.866
YOU WANNA THAT'S THAT'S

02:47:22.932 --> 02:47:25.135
PERFECTLY FINE NO -- IT'S I

02:47:25.201 --> 02:47:26.202
THINK I THINK THE THE TWO

02:47:26.269 --> 02:47:27.670
LEGISLATIVE PIECES THAT ARE HERE

02:47:27.737 --> 02:47:29.139
THAT WERE REPORTING ON A REALLY

02:47:29.205 --> 02:47:30.707
DESIGNED TO SORT OF HELP US TO

02:47:30.774 --> 02:47:32.142
BEGIN TO CREATE THAT THAT.

02:47:32.208 --> 02:47:33.877
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHERE DO WE

02:47:33.943 --> 02:47:35.445
CONNECT THE SYSTEMS IN TERMS OF

02:47:35.512 --> 02:47:37.180
THE DATA POINTS IN OTHER WORDS

02:47:37.247 --> 02:47:38.448
WHAT ARE THE RELEVANT PIECES.

02:47:38.515 --> 02:47:40.350
BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE

02:47:40.417 --> 02:47:41.918
COLLEGE AND CAREER INDICATORS

02:47:41.985 --> 02:47:43.319
THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THE CAGE

02:47:43.386 --> 02:47:44.354
WILL SYSTEM.

02:47:44.421 --> 02:47:45.088
AND THEN HOW TO THOSE SORT OF

02:47:45.155 --> 02:47:47.257
RELATE BECAUSE WE KNOW FULL WELL

02:47:47.323 --> 02:47:48.725
THAT PART OF THE COLLEGE --

02:47:48.792 --> 02:47:50.960
INDICATOR IS -- LIKE DUAL

02:47:51.027 --> 02:47:55.432
ENROLLMENT -- WHICH IS.

02:47:55.498 --> 02:47:56.032
A GOOD WAY TO SORT OF MEASURE

02:47:56.099 --> 02:47:56.733
WHETHER STUDENTS ARE MAKING

02:47:56.800 --> 02:47:58.334
PROGRESS IN COLLEGE ATTAINMENT

02:47:58.401 --> 02:47:59.202
SO.

02:47:59.269 --> 02:48:00.537
WHAT WE'VE DONE NOW THAT'S THE

02:48:00.603 --> 02:48:02.639
GOAL YEAH IF THAT'S THE GOAL SO

02:48:02.705 --> 02:48:03.907
I MEAN THE SORT OF METRICS THAT

02:48:03.973 --> 02:48:05.742
WE HAVE IN STRONG WORK FOR US

02:48:05.809 --> 02:48:07.744
WE'RE TRYING TO INSURE THAT

02:48:07.811 --> 02:48:08.878
THEY'RE CONNECTING?

02:48:08.945 --> 02:48:10.780
AND PART OF THAT WORK IS IT'S

02:48:10.847 --> 02:48:11.948
THE LONGITUDINAL THAT YOU'RE

02:48:12.015 --> 02:48:13.116
TALKING ABOUT.

02:48:13.183 --> 02:48:14.784
IT'S INSURING THAT THE DATA MO

02:48:14.851 --> 02:48:17.420
USER IN PLACE TO TO TO SAY THAT

02:48:17.487 --> 02:48:19.522
CAL PADS CAN TALK TO THE

02:48:19.589 --> 02:48:20.423
COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN MY S.

02:48:20.490 --> 02:48:21.157
SYSTEM.

02:48:21.224 --> 02:48:23.359
SO THAT WE CAN CREATE SORT OF A

02:48:23.426 --> 02:48:25.094
OF A PIPELINE BECAUSE THIS IS A

02:48:25.161 --> 02:48:26.563
PIPELINE CREATION RIGHT IF

02:48:26.629 --> 02:48:27.997
THERE'S ANYTHING THAT THESE TWO

02:48:28.064 --> 02:48:29.499
PIECES OF LEGISLATION ARE

02:48:29.566 --> 02:48:30.800
DESIGNED TO DO.

02:48:30.867 --> 02:48:32.168
IS TRY TO CONNECT THE SYSTEMS

02:48:32.235 --> 02:48:33.770
WHEN WE GO TO OTHER STATES AND

02:48:33.837 --> 02:48:35.238
PRESENT ON THIS.

02:48:35.305 --> 02:48:36.539
IS NOT A LOT OF OTHER STATES

02:48:36.606 --> 02:48:38.041
THAT ARE CONNECTING THAT THE

02:48:38.107 --> 02:48:39.375
SECONDARY TO POST SECONDARY

02:48:39.442 --> 02:48:42.312
SYSTEM RIGHT SO WE ALSO NEED THE

02:48:42.378 --> 02:48:44.747
END RIGHT AND WE NEED TO HAVE

02:48:44.814 --> 02:48:45.315
THE DATA.

02:48:45.381 --> 02:48:46.249
THE OUTCOME DATA IN ORDER TO

02:48:46.316 --> 02:48:49.052
DEVELOP TO EVALUATE THE

02:48:49.118 --> 02:48:50.820
EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF

02:48:50.887 --> 02:48:52.155
THE VARIOUS PROGRAMS THAT WE'RE

02:48:52.222 --> 02:48:55.058
FINDING AND BE AGILE ENOUGH. TWO

02:48:55.124 --> 02:48:56.960
SHIFTS TO PIVOT FROM PROGRAM

02:48:57.026 --> 02:48:58.528
BETA PROGRAM BE IF A IS NOT

02:48:58.595 --> 02:48:59.729
WORKING.

02:48:59.796 --> 02:49:01.531
OR WERE PRODUCING PEOPLE WERE

02:49:01.598 --> 02:49:04.200
TURNING OUT A PRODUCT THAT THAT

02:49:04.267 --> 02:49:04.667
INDUSTRY DOESN'T NEED

02:49:04.734 --> 02:49:04.968
[inaudible]

02:49:05.034 --> 02:49:06.436
RIGHT.

02:49:06.503 --> 02:49:07.971
YEAH THERE'S CERTAIN PROGRAMS

02:49:08.037 --> 02:49:09.739
THAT A K. THROUGH TWELVE SYSTEM

02:49:09.806 --> 02:49:11.074
WILL BE ABLE TO OFFER BETTER

02:49:11.140 --> 02:49:12.609
THAN A COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN AND

02:49:12.675 --> 02:49:13.943
VICE VERSA SO.

02:49:14.010 --> 02:49:15.211
WHERE IS THE DEVELOPMENTAL NEED

02:49:15.278 --> 02:49:16.746
OF THE STUDENT IN TERMS OF THEIR

02:49:16.813 --> 02:49:18.147
TRAJECTORY AND I THINK THAT'S

02:49:18.214 --> 02:49:19.382
THE QUESTION TO GET OUT THERE

02:49:19.449 --> 02:49:20.683
AND IF I CAN JUST JUMP IN HERE

02:49:20.750 --> 02:49:21.751
TO REMEMBER ALEXANDER WITH

02:49:21.818 --> 02:49:23.453
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- YOU

02:49:23.520 --> 02:49:25.522
DIDN'T KNOW WHAT THE GOVERNOR'S

02:49:25.588 --> 02:49:27.757
PROPOSAL -- TO PROVIDE TEN

02:49:27.824 --> 02:49:28.424
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE CREATION

02:49:28.491 --> 02:49:29.259
OF THIS.

02:49:29.325 --> 02:49:31.895
AT CRADLE TO CAREER -- MINOR

02:49:31.961 --> 02:49:33.396
TIDAL DATA SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY

02:49:33.463 --> 02:49:34.831
THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH MANY OF THE

02:49:34.898 --> 02:49:36.566
GOALS THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING --

02:49:36.633 --> 02:49:38.568
TO GET THAT NO FOR THIS YEAR

02:49:38.635 --> 02:49:39.235
THAT WE'VE BEEN HAVING

02:49:39.302 --> 02:49:41.304
DISCUSSIONS ON YOU KNOW FOR THE

02:49:41.371 --> 02:49:42.872
PAST YEAH I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY

02:49:42.939 --> 02:49:44.908
YEARS -- BUT JUST REALLY BEING

02:49:44.974 --> 02:49:46.409
ABLE TO TRACK -- AS STUDENTS

02:49:46.476 --> 02:49:48.645
PROGRESS AS THEY GO FROM K.

02:49:48.711 --> 02:49:49.812
TWELVE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE

02:49:49.879 --> 02:49:50.980
INTO THE WORK FORCE AND REALLY

02:49:51.047 --> 02:49:52.448
FINDING OUT YOU KNOW WHERE THEY

02:49:52.515 --> 02:49:54.117
END UP ALONG THAT EDUCATIONAL

02:49:54.183 --> 02:49:57.020
PATHWAY -- WITH REGARDS TO THESE

02:49:57.086 --> 02:49:58.621
TWO PROGRAMS SPECIFICALLY -- IN

02:49:58.688 --> 02:49:59.856
RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE DATA

02:49:59.923 --> 02:50:01.491
DEFICIENCIES THAT THAT HAD BEEN

02:50:01.558 --> 02:50:02.725
IDENTIFIED IN PREVIOUS YEARS

02:50:02.792 --> 02:50:03.993
THERE WERE SOME IMPORTANT

02:50:04.060 --> 02:50:05.995
CHANGES THAT WERE MADE LAST YEAR --

02:50:06.062 --> 02:50:07.864
IT FOR BOTH PROGRAMS AND ONE OF

02:50:07.931 --> 02:50:09.399
THE KEY CHANGES WAS REALLY THE

02:50:09.465 --> 02:50:11.134
INCORPORATION OF THE CALIFORNIA

02:50:11.200 --> 02:50:12.936
WORKFORCE AND JOINT ADVISORY

02:50:13.002 --> 02:50:13.770
COMMITTEE.

02:50:13.836 --> 02:50:15.738
AND FOR BOTH OF THESE PROGRAMS

02:50:15.805 --> 02:50:17.740
THAT COMMITTEE IS ASKED TO GO IN

02:50:17.807 --> 02:50:19.309
AND REVIEW THE DATA METRICS THAT

02:50:19.375 --> 02:50:21.377
ARE REQUIRED TO BE REPORTED ON

02:50:21.444 --> 02:50:22.879
BY A GRANT APPLICANTS.

02:50:22.946 --> 02:50:24.347
AND TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AS

02:50:24.414 --> 02:50:25.014
TO IF THEY'RE THE MOST

02:50:25.081 --> 02:50:27.083
APPROPRIATE METRICS ENSURING

02:50:27.150 --> 02:50:27.550
THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY

02:50:27.617 --> 02:50:28.751
COLLECTIBLE.

02:50:28.818 --> 02:50:30.086
AND THEN ALSO LOOKING AT WHETHER

02:50:30.153 --> 02:50:31.821
NEW METRICS NEEDED TO BE ADDED

02:50:31.888 --> 02:50:33.423
AND SO AS OUR DATA SYSTEMS

02:50:33.489 --> 02:50:34.891
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP.

02:50:34.958 --> 02:50:35.925
THE HOPE IS THAT WE'LL BE ABLE

02:50:35.992 --> 02:50:37.727
TO INCORPORATE MORE CAREER

02:50:37.794 --> 02:50:39.963
MEASURES INTO -- INDICATORS LIKE

02:50:40.029 --> 02:50:41.331
THE COLLEGE AND CAREER AND

02:50:41.397 --> 02:50:42.665
REALLY HAVE THAT DATA THAT WE

02:50:42.732 --> 02:50:44.200
NEED TO MAKE AN INFORMED

02:50:44.267 --> 02:50:45.802
DECISIONS AT THE STATE LEVEL.

02:50:45.868 --> 02:50:52.141
IT'S REALLY A CONNECTIVITY ISSUE

02:50:52.208 --> 02:50:53.309
ISN'T IT BECAUSE WE HAVE THESE.

02:50:53.376 --> 02:50:54.110
THESE ENTITIES THESE

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:54.677
ORGANIZATIONS THESE SYSTEMS

02:50:54.744 --> 02:50:55.912
WORKING IN THE SAME.

02:50:55.979 --> 02:50:56.546
YOU KNOW ENVIRONMENT BUT YOU'RE

02:50:56.613 --> 02:50:58.014
WORKING AND SO THE QUESTION IS

02:50:58.081 --> 02:50:59.716
HOW YOU CONNECT.

02:50:59.782 --> 02:51:00.783
AND OPERATE IN THE MOST

02:51:00.850 --> 02:51:03.052
EFFICIENT WAY TO INSURE THAT

02:51:03.119 --> 02:51:05.221
YOUR SERVICING YOUR CUSTOMER

02:51:05.288 --> 02:51:07.924
CLIENT WHICH IN YOUR CASE IS.

02:51:07.991 --> 02:51:10.126
OF THE STUDENTS SERVICE AND MAKE

02:51:10.193 --> 02:51:11.828
SURE THAT YOU DELIVER TO THEM

02:51:11.894 --> 02:51:13.029
THE PRODUCT THAT THEY THINK

02:51:13.096 --> 02:51:14.697
THEY'RE GONNA GET WHICH IS AN

02:51:14.764 --> 02:51:16.532
EDUCATION THAT GETS THEM.

02:51:16.599 --> 02:51:18.534
A GOOD PAYING JOB IN A FIELD

02:51:18.601 --> 02:51:19.736
THEY WANT TO WORK IN.

02:51:19.802 --> 02:51:21.070
WHETHER THEY'RE A HIGH SCHOOL

02:51:21.137 --> 02:51:23.006
GRADUATE OR A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:51:23.072 --> 02:51:25.441
GRADUATE OR SOMETHING BEYOND OR

02:51:25.508 --> 02:51:26.676
SOMETHING IN BETWEEN.

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:28.144
AND THAT'S REALLY THE ISSUE IT

02:51:28.211 --> 02:51:29.646
REQUIRES DAY THAT REQUIRES

02:51:29.712 --> 02:51:30.947
EVERYBODY TO TALK TOGETHER IN

02:51:31.014 --> 02:51:32.115
THE DATA.

02:51:32.181 --> 02:51:33.783
TO BE ACCESSIBLE BY EVERYONE AND

02:51:33.850 --> 02:51:34.517
THEN.

02:51:34.584 --> 02:51:36.953
SOME OF I WEIGH TION OF PROGRAMS

02:51:37.020 --> 02:51:38.388
AND THE MONEY THAT WE SPEND AND

02:51:38.454 --> 02:51:40.056
THE RE DIRECTION OF THAT MONEY

02:51:40.123 --> 02:51:42.592
IF THEY'RE BETTER WAYS.

02:51:42.659 --> 02:51:45.294
TO USE THAT MONEY BUT ANYWAY

02:51:45.361 --> 02:51:46.629
GREAT JOB I DID I DO YOU.

02:51:46.696 --> 02:51:48.798
ANYBODY HAVE ANYTHING ELSE.

02:51:48.865 --> 02:51:51.401
GREAT PRESENTATION LOOK FORWARD

02:51:51.467 --> 02:51:55.171
TO WORKING WITH YOU THANK YOU.

02:51:55.238 --> 02:51:57.907
ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT IS ADULT

02:51:57.974 --> 02:52:00.943
EDUCATION.

FOCUSED ON THE LAST TWO THREE

02:59:06.402 --> 02:59:08.104
YEARS HAVE BEEN THE STRUCTURAL

02:59:08.170 --> 02:59:10.506
ISSUES DESCRIBE THAT MEANS WE

02:59:10.573 --> 02:59:12.708
ADULT EDUCATION WAS RE IMAGINE

02:59:12.775 --> 02:59:13.943
AND REGIONAL COMES.

AS RITA CONSORTIA AND WAS TO BE

02:59:15.744 --> 02:59:17.379
BASED ON METRICS SO WE VIEW

02:59:17.446 --> 02:59:19.482
THOSE AS STRUCTURAL ISSUES THAT

02:59:19.548 --> 02:59:20.716
NEED TO BE ADDRESSED.

02:59:20.783 --> 02:59:23.018
SO WE'VE INVESTED AND CAPACITY

BUILDING WITHIN OUR REGIONAL

02:59:23.686 --> 02:59:25.488
CONSORTIA SO THEY COULD DO THE

02:59:25.554 --> 02:59:26.856
KIND OF PLANNING.

WITH THEIR STAKEHOLDERS MONKS

02:59:28.657 --> 02:59:30.526
THE PROVIDERS THOSE ARE SEVEN

02:59:30.593 --> 02:59:34.530
ONE CONSORTIUMS OVERSEE THREE

02:59:34.597 --> 02:59:36.198
HUNDRED FIFTY PROVIDERS -- BEEN

02:59:36.265 --> 02:59:37.399
ALSO A BIG KEY TO THIS ACTUALLY

02:59:37.466 --> 02:59:38.901
BECOMING UP A SYSTEM OF A

02:59:38.968 --> 02:59:40.469
PROGRAM MADE UP OF TWO SYSTEMS.

02:59:40.536 --> 02:59:42.304
ARE THE METRICS AND THE DATA

02:59:42.371 --> 02:59:45.074
THAT WE WE ACTUALLY REQUIRE OUR

02:59:45.141 --> 02:59:46.442
PROVIDERS TO REPORT.

02:59:46.509 --> 02:59:48.811
AND GLAD TO SAY THAT BUT DURING

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:50.146
THE LAST THREE YEARS WE'VE

02:59:50.212 --> 02:59:51.714
CREATED A UNIFORM DATA

02:59:51.780 --> 02:59:53.182
COLLECTION SYSTEM.

02:59:53.249 --> 02:59:55.684
WHICH WAS A PROVIDER FOR THAT WE

02:59:55.751 --> 02:59:57.119
TITLE TO THAT SEE THE LOCAL CITY

02:59:57.186 --> 02:59:58.254
FOR MANY YEARS.

02:59:58.320 --> 03:00:00.055
SO THEY ACTUALLY BECAME A

03:00:00.122 --> 03:00:02.024
UNIFORM DATA COLLECTION PROVIDER

03:00:02.091 --> 03:00:03.192
FOR THE KP TWELVE FOR THE STATE

03:00:03.259 --> 03:00:06.529
PROGRAM AS WELL -- LAST YEAR --

03:00:06.595 --> 03:00:08.130
WE ACTUALLY REQUIRED OUR

03:00:08.197 --> 03:00:13.135
COLLEGES TO PARTICIPATE WITH THE

03:00:13.202 --> 03:00:16.338
ACTUALLY YOUR PRIOR THE LAST

03:00:16.405 --> 03:00:17.273
YEAR WE HAVE.

03:00:17.339 --> 03:00:18.007
ACTUALLY JUST RELY ON THERE ARE

03:00:18.073 --> 03:00:19.341
EXISTING REPORTING SYSTEM TO

03:00:19.408 --> 03:00:20.442
MEET OUR REPORTING NEEDS FOR

03:00:20.509 --> 03:00:22.978
ADULT EDUCATION SO ARE WE NOW

03:00:23.045 --> 03:00:24.813

03:00:24.880 --> 03:00:27.816
R. OUR OUR WEEK OUR PROVIDER

03:00:27.883 --> 03:00:30.386
CROSSES AND ALL THAT DATA --

03:00:30.452 --> 03:00:32.821
GETS REPORTED UP TO TO A FILE ON

03:00:32.888 --> 03:00:35.424
THAT'S PRESENTED UTILIZING A

03:00:35.491 --> 03:00:36.825
PLATFORM THAT WE REFER TO IN A

03:00:36.892 --> 03:00:38.294
LARGE BOARD AS ADULT EDUCATION

03:00:38.360 --> 03:00:39.195
PIPELINE.

03:00:39.261 --> 03:00:42.031
AND THAT DATA IS UTILIZES.

03:00:42.097 --> 03:00:44.767
ALARM ARCADY TRIAL DATA AT THE

03:00:44.833 --> 03:00:47.203
VALIDATE SARAH TRANSITION DATA

03:00:47.269 --> 03:00:49.572
WHAT AM I A SYSTEM -- AND THEN

03:00:49.638 --> 03:00:52.174
ACTUALLY -- VALIDATES WITH EDT

03:00:52.241 --> 03:00:53.309
TAXING NOW THAT WE COULD

03:00:53.375 --> 03:00:57.346
ACTUALLY PORT WAGE GAINS -- IT

03:00:57.413 --> 03:00:58.447
AND PUT THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY

03:00:58.514 --> 03:00:59.915
WORKING THAT OUT TWO QUARTERS

03:00:59.982 --> 03:01:01.016
AFTER EXIT.

03:01:01.083 --> 03:01:06.355
THINGS THAT WE CANNOT TELL YOU

03:01:06.422 --> 03:01:06.922
IN THE PAST REGARDING ADULT

03:01:06.989 --> 03:01:08.524
EDUCATION -- SO AND THAT THE

03:01:08.591 --> 03:01:10.125
PLATFORM IS WHAT WE UTILIZE TO

03:01:10.192 --> 03:01:11.794
NOW MOVING FORWARD TO REPORT Q..

03:01:11.860 --> 03:01:12.695
ON THE LEGISLATURE AND THE

03:01:12.761 --> 03:01:14.196
GOVERNOR -- BUT ALSO IT PROVIDES

03:01:14.263 --> 03:01:15.898
A PLATFORM THAT'S USABLE FOR

03:01:15.965 --> 03:01:17.266
CONSORTIUMS OUR PROVIDERS.

03:01:17.333 --> 03:01:18.867
SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE ACTIONABLE

03:01:18.934 --> 03:01:21.003
DATA IN WHICH THEY COULD UTILIZE

03:01:21.070 --> 03:01:23.138
FOR THEIR THREE YEAR PLANNING

03:01:23.205 --> 03:01:23.906
WHICH THEY HAVE UNDER WAY IN

03:01:23.973 --> 03:01:25.407
WHICH THAT'S PART OF OUR

03:01:25.474 --> 03:01:26.976
STRUCTURAL WORK THAT WE DID IS

03:01:27.042 --> 03:01:28.344
THAT WE ACTUALLY CREATED BY

03:01:28.410 --> 03:01:29.612
THREE YEAR PLANNING PROCESS.

03:01:29.678 --> 03:01:32.448
THAT HAS FOUR COMPONENTS TO IT

03:01:32.514 --> 03:01:35.017
ONE IS THEY ACTUALLY -- DO AN

03:01:35.084 --> 03:01:36.585
ASSESSMENT OF THE RESOURCES

03:01:36.652 --> 03:01:38.120
REGIONALLY AMONGST THEIR

03:01:38.187 --> 03:01:40.456
PROVIDERS AMONGST APPROACH THEIR

03:01:40.522 --> 03:01:42.224
THEIR PARTNERS SUCH AS THE THE

03:01:42.291 --> 03:01:43.459
CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

03:01:43.525 --> 03:01:45.027
BOARD SYSTEMS.

03:01:45.094 --> 03:01:46.061
AND THEN ALSO THEN THEY ACTUALLY

03:01:46.128 --> 03:01:47.563
CAN DO CONCERTS LOOK AT THE

03:01:47.630 --> 03:01:48.931
NEEDS OF THEIR COMMUNITY

03:01:48.998 --> 03:01:51.166
ACTUALLY LOOK AT THE REGION.

03:01:51.233 --> 03:01:52.635
THE LABOR MARKET INFORMATION

03:01:52.701 --> 03:01:53.969
WE'VE MADE A LOT OF VESTMENTS

03:01:54.036 --> 03:01:55.337
AND MADE A LOT OF DATA AVAILABLE

03:01:55.404 --> 03:01:56.105
WE ARE ON LABOR MARKET

03:01:56.171 --> 03:01:57.306
INFORMATION JUST TO GET THE

03:01:57.373 --> 03:01:58.440
CONVERSATION GOING.

03:01:58.507 --> 03:02:00.643
WE WANT THEM TO WORK WITH THE

03:02:00.709 --> 03:02:01.210
LOCAL WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

03:02:01.277 --> 03:02:02.011
SYSTEM.

03:02:02.077 --> 03:02:03.345
THEN AFTER THAT ACTUALLY COME UP

03:02:03.412 --> 03:02:04.813
WITH SOME STRATEGIES.

03:02:04.880 --> 03:02:06.448
AND THEN AFTER THAT PILOT SOME

03:02:06.515 --> 03:02:08.751
NEW IDEAS -- SO THAT'S KIND OF

03:02:08.817 --> 03:02:10.252
THE STRUCTURAL THINGS WE'VE DONE

03:02:10.319 --> 03:02:12.154
TO ACTUALLY MOVE -- ACHIEVE I

03:02:12.221 --> 03:02:14.323
THINK SOME ACCOMPLISHMENTS AS A

03:02:14.390 --> 03:02:20.129
10% INCREASE IN SERVICES AND SO

03:02:20.195 --> 03:02:22.298
ON WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE.

03:02:22.364 --> 03:02:22.631
LET.

03:02:22.698 --> 03:02:23.399
ME JUST ASK THIS QUESTION I MEAN

03:02:23.465 --> 03:02:24.233
BEYOND DATA COLLECTION

03:02:24.300 --> 03:02:26.068
COMPILATION THINGS LIKE THAT --

03:02:26.135 --> 03:02:27.836
V. L. A. -- MENTION SOME.

03:02:27.903 --> 03:02:31.807
EXISTING ISSUES -- IN TERMS OF

03:02:31.874 --> 03:02:33.742
MAKING THE TWO IN ESSENCE THE

03:02:33.809 --> 03:02:35.277
COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM IN CASE

03:02:35.344 --> 03:02:37.746
OF TWELVE WORK SMOOTHLY TOWARD

03:02:37.813 --> 03:02:40.316
ACCOMPLISHING A COMMON GOAL HERE

03:02:40.382 --> 03:02:41.817
IN ADULT EDUCATION ONE WAS.

03:02:41.884 --> 03:02:43.485
EARLY A FUNDING ISSUE THE OTHER

03:02:43.552 --> 03:02:44.153
IS THERE.

03:02:44.219 --> 03:02:45.521
MUST BE A CREDENTIALING

03:02:45.587 --> 03:02:48.223
QUALIFICATION ISSUE -- ALLOWING

03:02:48.290 --> 03:02:50.926
INSTRUCTORS TO SERVE CROSS TEACH

03:02:50.993 --> 03:02:52.995
SO TO SPEAK IN DIFFERENT

03:02:53.062 --> 03:02:53.896
ENVIRONMENTS.

03:02:53.962 --> 03:02:55.698
MAYBE YOU COULD DISCUSS SOME OF

03:02:55.764 --> 03:02:57.399
THE IMPEDIMENTS THAT THAT IF IF

03:02:57.466 --> 03:02:59.501
THAT'S THE RIGHT WORD -- THEY WE

03:02:59.568 --> 03:03:01.437
HAVE STRUCTURALLY HERE IN THE

03:03:01.503 --> 03:03:03.105
STATE.

03:03:03.172 --> 03:03:06.275
THAT CREATES SOME ISSUE WITH

03:03:06.342 --> 03:03:08.844
RESPECT TO HAVING -- SMOOTHLY

03:03:08.911 --> 03:03:10.813
RUNNING ADULT EDUCATION.

03:03:10.879 --> 03:03:13.615
SYSTEM INVOLVING PARTICIPANTS

03:03:13.682 --> 03:03:14.483
FROM DIFFERENT COMING FROM TO

03:03:14.550 --> 03:03:16.285
THE PROCESS FROM DIFFERENT

03:03:16.352 --> 03:03:17.986
DIRECTIONS THE FIST QUESTION --

03:03:18.053 --> 03:03:19.421
CERTAINLY AND I'D LIKE TO CALL

03:03:19.488 --> 03:03:20.456
IT A CHALLENGE.

03:03:20.522 --> 03:03:22.858
VERSES AN IMPEDIMENT BECAUSE IT

03:03:22.925 --> 03:03:24.226
IT IS A CHALLENGE AND I'D LIKE

03:03:24.293 --> 03:03:26.595
TO TALK OF IT -- CREDENTIALING

03:03:26.662 --> 03:03:28.630
THE TEACHER QUALIFICATION PIECE

03:03:28.697 --> 03:03:29.365
FIRST.

03:03:29.431 --> 03:03:31.467
CURRENTLY -- INDIVIDUALS THAT

03:03:31.533 --> 03:03:33.902
TEACH IN A K. ADULT.

03:03:33.969 --> 03:03:36.772
SYSTEM ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE A

03:03:36.839 --> 03:03:40.109
CURRENT CREDENTIAL ISSUED BY CTC.

03:03:40.175 --> 03:03:41.677
IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM

03:03:41.744 --> 03:03:42.945
THEY HAVE TO MEET MINIMUM

03:03:43.011 --> 03:03:45.314
QUALIFICATIONS. ONE OF THOSE

03:03:45.381 --> 03:03:47.816
MINIMUM QUALIFICATIONS CAN BE

03:03:47.883 --> 03:03:49.284
THE FACT THAT THEY HAVE A

03:03:49.351 --> 03:03:50.886
TEACHING CREDENTIAL.

03:03:50.953 --> 03:03:52.621
IF THEY ARE -- AND IT'S UP TO

03:03:52.688 --> 03:03:54.123
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHOOSE

03:03:54.189 --> 03:03:55.858
WHICH QUALIFICATION THEY'RE

03:03:55.924 --> 03:03:58.293
GOING. TO TO RECEDE THE OTHER

03:03:58.360 --> 03:04:00.429
CHALLENGE IS THERE'S A PAY

03:04:00.496 --> 03:04:01.597
DIFFERENTIAL.

03:04:01.663 --> 03:04:03.098
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES RE ABLE

03:04:03.165 --> 03:04:04.600
TO PAY THOSE TEACHERS AT A

03:04:04.666 --> 03:04:06.335
HIGHER RATE.

03:04:06.402 --> 03:04:08.570
THAN MANY OF OUR KD ADULT SCHOOL

03:04:08.637 --> 03:04:10.406
DISTRICTS ARE ABLE TO PAY THEIR

03:04:10.472 --> 03:04:11.607
TEACHERS.

03:04:11.673 --> 03:04:12.908
AND THAT HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE

03:04:12.975 --> 03:04:14.843
FOR THAT PAID PIECE AND THEN TO

03:04:14.910 --> 03:04:16.011
BRING INSTRUCTORS FROM THE

03:04:16.078 --> 03:04:18.313
COMMUNITY COLLEGE INTO OUR K.

03:04:18.380 --> 03:04:19.648
TWELVE CABLE SYSTEM.

03:04:19.715 --> 03:04:22.451
THEY HAVE TO THEN GO AND GET A

03:04:22.518 --> 03:04:23.452
CREDENTIAL BECAUSE IN ORDER TO

03:04:23.519 --> 03:04:26.021
TEACH AND BE ON THE PAYROLL THEY

03:04:26.088 --> 03:04:27.089
HAVE TO HAVE THAT CREDENTIAL AND

03:04:27.156 --> 03:04:29.057
WE ARE LOOKING AT SOME WAYS

03:04:29.124 --> 03:04:31.126
THROUGH OUR ADULT EDUCATION

03:04:31.193 --> 03:04:32.628
ASSOCIATIONS TO COME UP.

03:04:32.694 --> 03:04:34.863
WITH WAYS TO EASE THAT BURDEN

03:04:34.930 --> 03:04:36.932
BECAUSE THERE IS A COST TO TO GO

03:04:36.999 --> 03:04:38.934
AND GET YOUR CREDENTIAL.

03:04:39.001 --> 03:04:40.836
UP. TO THREE FOUR FIVE THOUSAND

03:04:40.903 --> 03:04:43.338
DOLLARS. TO GET THAT CREDENTIAL

03:04:43.405 --> 03:04:45.140
AND SO IT IS A COST TO THOSE

03:04:45.207 --> 03:04:46.442
TEACHERS WHO ARE THEN GOING TO

03:04:46.508 --> 03:04:47.576
BE MAKING.

03:04:47.643 --> 03:04:49.478
NOT A NOT A LOT OF MONEY TO

03:04:49.545 --> 03:04:51.447
RECOUP THAT IN THE FUTURE SO

03:04:51.513 --> 03:04:52.848
WE'RE LOOKING AT WAYS

03:04:52.915 --> 03:04:53.148
[inaudible]

03:04:53.215 --> 03:04:54.850
TO STREAMLINE THAT.

03:04:54.917 --> 03:04:56.952
I REALIZE THE SENSITIVITY OF

03:04:57.019 --> 03:04:59.154
THIS QUESTION OF BUT IT WOULD

03:04:59.221 --> 03:05:00.689
SEEM TO ME THAT MAYBE THIS IS A

03:05:00.756 --> 03:05:01.924
CONVERSATION THAT WE NEED TO

03:05:01.990 --> 03:05:05.194
HAVE AT LEAST IN TERMS OF I MEAN

03:05:05.260 --> 03:05:06.495
I GUESS IT DEPENDS ON WHAT WE'RE

03:05:06.562 --> 03:05:07.863
TRYING TO TEACH AND WHO WERE

03:05:07.930 --> 03:05:09.064
TRYING TO TEACH.

03:05:09.131 --> 03:05:10.732
AND IS IT US THIS IS A

03:05:10.799 --> 03:05:12.267
SPECIALIZED.

03:05:12.334 --> 03:05:14.837
AREA OR TO OUR SUBJECT AREA

03:05:14.903 --> 03:05:15.604
WHERE.

03:05:15.671 --> 03:05:17.072
IT WOULD IT WOULD.

03:05:17.139 --> 03:05:19.041
BE VERY DIFFICULT TO NECESSARILY

03:05:19.107 --> 03:05:20.776
HAVE SOMEBODY CREDENTIALED IN

03:05:20.843 --> 03:05:22.044
THE CONTEXT OF K. THROUGH TWELVE

03:05:22.110 --> 03:05:23.979
AT A PARTICULAR DISTRICT BECAUSE

03:05:24.046 --> 03:05:25.581
MAYBE DON'T TEACH THAT OFTEN.

03:05:25.647 --> 03:05:26.748
MAYBE THERE THAT THAT MANY

03:05:26.815 --> 03:05:28.383
STUDENTS INTO TEACHING IT AND

03:05:28.450 --> 03:05:30.152
THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE MIGHT HAVE

03:05:30.219 --> 03:05:31.086
SOMEONE AVAILABLE IN A

03:05:31.153 --> 03:05:32.521
SPECIALIZED AREA TO TEACH A

03:05:32.588 --> 03:05:33.889
PARTICULAR COURSE.

03:05:33.956 --> 03:05:40.329
AND IT WOULD SEEM SORT OF AND

03:05:40.395 --> 03:05:44.466
DIFFICULT TO REQUIRE. EIGHT TO

03:05:44.533 --> 03:05:45.100
TWELVE TEACHING CREDENTIAL UNDER

03:05:45.167 --> 03:05:47.236
THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES ON THE OTHER

03:05:47.302 --> 03:05:49.171
HAND IF YOU'RE TEACHING ENGLISH --

03:05:49.238 --> 03:05:50.506
IN YOUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE

03:05:50.572 --> 03:05:53.008
INSTRUCTOR AND THEY WANT TO PUT

03:05:53.075 --> 03:05:53.642
YOU OUT OF SIGHT SHE WON A CASE

03:05:53.709 --> 03:05:56.311
OF TWELVE CAMPUS TO KEEP TEACH

03:05:56.378 --> 03:05:57.212
ENGLISH WELL THAT'S SOMETHING

03:05:57.279 --> 03:05:59.281
THAT. EIGHT TO TWELVE RB

03:05:59.348 --> 03:06:00.883
TEACHING.

03:06:00.949 --> 03:06:02.217
THEN I WOULD THINK THAT THAT

03:06:02.284 --> 03:06:03.552
WOULD BE A DIFFERENT SCENARIO OR

03:06:03.619 --> 03:06:06.255
MY COMMENTS MAKING SENSE SUIT SO

03:06:06.321 --> 03:06:07.256
THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT

03:06:07.322 --> 03:06:09.391
YOU'RE TEACHING SO THEY ARE --

03:06:09.458 --> 03:06:11.894
IN THE CREDENTIALING SYSTEM A

03:06:11.960 --> 03:06:14.563
TEACHER TEACHING INDICATED OLD

03:06:14.630 --> 03:06:15.931
SCHOOL CAN HAVE.

03:06:15.998 --> 03:06:18.734
HE A MULTIPLE SUBJECT OR A HIGH

03:06:18.800 --> 03:06:21.303
SCHOOL TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND

03:06:21.370 --> 03:06:22.538
THAT ALLOWS THEM TO TEACH ADULTS

03:06:22.604 --> 03:06:24.106
AND IT'S VERY SPECIFIC ON THEIR

03:06:24.172 --> 03:06:25.307
CREDENTIAL.

03:06:25.374 --> 03:06:26.341
THEN THERE IS WHAT'S CALLED A

03:06:26.408 --> 03:06:28.310
DESIGNATED SUBJECTS CREDENTIAL

03:06:28.377 --> 03:06:30.779
IN THE THAT IS FOR SOMEONE WHO.

03:06:30.846 --> 03:06:32.047
HAS A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN

03:06:32.114 --> 03:06:33.448
WISHES TO PERHAPS WORK WITH

03:06:33.515 --> 03:06:35.350
ADULTS WHO ARE LEARNING ENGLISH

03:06:35.417 --> 03:06:36.718
AND THEY WANT TO COME BACK AND

03:06:36.785 --> 03:06:37.619
TEACH.

03:06:37.686 --> 03:06:39.855
WRAPS THE RETIRED NOW AND AND

03:06:39.922 --> 03:06:41.423
THEY WANT TO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

03:06:41.490 --> 03:06:43.225
DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT AND SO

03:06:43.292 --> 03:06:44.326
THEN THEY HAVE TO GO THROUGH

03:06:44.393 --> 03:06:46.395
COURSE WORK TO EARN THAT

03:06:46.461 --> 03:06:47.963
DESIGNATED SUBJECTS CREDENTIAL.

03:06:48.030 --> 03:06:49.231
THE COURSE WORK REALLY FOCUSES

03:06:49.298 --> 03:06:50.966
ON AND GO G. IN THE TEACHING O

03:06:51.033 --> 03:06:52.167

AND ADULT LEARNERS VERSUS

03:06:54.136 --> 03:06:56.638
TEACHING CHILDREN WELL MAYBE

03:06:56.705 --> 03:06:57.372
MAYBE I NEED TO ASK A DIFFERENT

03:06:57.439 --> 03:06:58.407
QUESTION.

A SHORT TERM THEY HAVE TO BE

03:08:32.234 --> 03:08:34.403

BECAUSE THEY WANT TO HIRE.

03:10:43.431 --> 03:10:44.699
THAT THAT MAKES THINGS DIFFICULT.

03:10:44.766 --> 03:10:47.536

THE SYSTEM PROBABLY WE NEED TO

03:11:33.882 --> 03:11:34.349
TAKE A LOOK AT THE SYSTEM

03:11:34.416 --> 03:11:36.351
CONSISTENT WITH THE POLITICS

03:11:36.418 --> 03:11:37.519

03:11:41.523 --> 03:11:43.391
THERE'S A WAY TO MAKE THIS A

03:11:43.458 --> 03:11:45.327
LITTLE MORE AGILE WITHOUT

03:11:45.393 --> 03:11:47.362
STEPPING ON ANYBODY'S TOES AND

03:11:47.429 --> 03:11:49.764
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE

03:11:49.831 --> 03:11:52.567
PROPERLY CREDENTIALED AND AND

03:11:52.634 --> 03:11:54.035
AND MY MAKING SENSE I MEAN FOR

03:11:54.102 --> 03:11:56.605
EXAMPLE IF YOUR C. D. E. PROGRAM

03:11:56.671 --> 03:11:57.672
YOU HAVE YOUR TEACHING.

03:11:57.739 --> 03:11:59.574
SOMEONE YOU YOU NEED TO TRAIN

03:11:59.641 --> 03:12:01.343
SOME PEOPLE IN THE ADULT

03:12:01.409 --> 03:12:02.510
EDUCATION PROGRAM.

03:12:02.577 --> 03:12:04.079
AS OPPOSED TO WHATEVER WE WERE

03:12:04.145 --> 03:12:05.680
TALKING ABOUT EARLIER.

03:12:05.747 --> 03:12:08.316
IN IN COMPUTERIZED LOGISTICS

03:12:08.383 --> 03:12:10.018
WAREHOUSE MANAGEMENT.

03:12:10.085 --> 03:12:12.420
WHAT I NEED?

03:12:12.487 --> 03:12:13.421
TO TEACHING CREDENTIAL AND I'M

03:12:13.488 --> 03:12:14.689
GOING TO DO IT IN THE CASE YOU

03:12:14.756 --> 03:12:16.157
TO ON THE CASE TO TWELVE CAMPUS

03:12:16.224 --> 03:12:18.059
DO I NEED A TEACHING CREDENTIAL

03:12:18.126 --> 03:12:20.428
FOR THAT YES YOU DO.

03:12:20.495 --> 03:12:22.364
AND WHAT SORT OF BURDEN DOES

03:12:22.430 --> 03:12:24.833
THAT IMPOSE ON A CASE TO TWELVE

03:12:24.900 --> 03:12:26.034
DISTRICT IF THEY NEED TO HIRE A

03:12:26.101 --> 03:12:26.935
CASE TO TWELVE INSTRUCTOR WITH

03:12:27.002 --> 03:12:29.070
THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL TO TEACH

03:12:29.137 --> 03:12:30.472
A COMPUTERIZED.

03:12:30.538 --> 03:12:33.308
LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT COURSE.

03:12:33.375 --> 03:12:36.211
ONCE EVERY TWO YEARS.

03:12:36.278 --> 03:12:37.412
IF THEY WOULD CREATE A LARGE

03:12:37.479 --> 03:12:39.447
BURDEN ON THAT ON THAT DISTRICT

03:12:39.514 --> 03:12:42.183
HOWEVER. TO TEACH A C. T. E.

03:12:42.250 --> 03:12:44.185
PROGRAM ON THE K. TWELVE

03:12:44.252 --> 03:12:46.521
DISTRICT YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE.

03:12:46.588 --> 03:12:49.658
A STANDARD KATE.

03:12:49.724 --> 03:12:50.492
TWELVE CREDENTIAL YOU WOULD HAVE

03:12:50.558 --> 03:12:52.427
A DESIGNATED SUBJECTS CREDENTIAL

03:12:52.494 --> 03:12:53.261
WHICH MEANS THAT YOU'RE AN

03:12:53.328 --> 03:12:54.696
EXPERT IN.

03:12:54.763 --> 03:12:55.864
THAT AREA THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

03:12:55.931 --> 03:12:57.232
FIELD EXPERIENCE AND WORK

03:12:57.299 --> 03:12:58.600
EXPERIENCE.

03:12:58.667 --> 03:13:01.336
IN THAT AREA OF LOGISTICS SO

03:13:01.403 --> 03:13:02.804
THAT YOU ARE AN EXPERT IN YOUR

03:13:02.871 --> 03:13:04.539
BRINGING THAT INFORMATION TO THE

03:13:04.606 --> 03:13:06.241
STUDENTS HOW EASY IS IT TO GET

03:13:06.308 --> 03:13:08.043
THAT SORT OF CREDENTIAL IT'S

03:13:08.109 --> 03:13:10.145
VERY CHALLENGING AND I KNOW THAT

03:13:10.211 --> 03:13:10.745
MICHELLE MACINTOSH COULD HAVE

03:13:10.812 --> 03:13:11.579
SHARED THAT.

03:13:11.646 --> 03:13:13.515
CD INCENTIVE GRANT WILL AS WELL

03:13:13.581 --> 03:13:14.215
I GUESS THAT'S WHAT I'M

03:13:14.282 --> 03:13:15.617
SUGGESTING CHALLENGING TOO

03:13:15.684 --> 03:13:17.485
BECAUSE WE WE CAN'T IT'S HARD TO

03:13:17.552 --> 03:13:19.487
BE COMPETITIVE SALARY WISE.

03:13:19.554 --> 03:13:20.855
WE CAN'T WE'RE NOT GONNA SOLVE

03:13:20.922 --> 03:13:22.590
THAT PROBLEM TODAY BUT I I DO

03:13:22.657 --> 03:13:23.825
THINK IT'S SOMETHING WE NEED TO

03:13:23.892 --> 03:13:24.826
THINK ABOUT.

03:13:24.893 --> 03:13:25.994
AND HAVE BRING ALL THE

03:13:26.061 --> 03:13:27.295
STAKEHOLDERS TO THE TABLE

03:13:27.362 --> 03:13:28.263
INCLUDING THE ONES THAT ARE

03:13:28.330 --> 03:13:29.931
PROTECTIVE OF CREDENTIALING AS

03:13:29.998 --> 03:13:31.032
THEY SHOULD BE.

03:13:31.099 --> 03:13:32.467
ABOUT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN

03:13:32.534 --> 03:13:33.969
APPROPRIATE CASES WE HAVE THE

03:13:34.035 --> 03:13:35.236
FLEXIBILITY.

03:13:35.303 --> 03:13:36.972
TO TEMPT IN THE SPECIALIZED

03:13:37.038 --> 03:13:42.510
AREAS NOT ESL NOT.

03:13:42.577 --> 03:13:43.178
SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT ARE

03:13:43.244 --> 03:13:43.878
TRADITIONALLY.

03:13:43.945 --> 03:13:44.346
IN THE CASE YOU TWELVE

03:13:44.412 --> 03:13:44.946
ENVIRONMENT.

03:13:45.013 --> 03:13:47.048
BRING SPECIALIZED PLAYERS TO THE

03:13:47.115 --> 03:13:48.984
TABLE SO WE'VE WE'VE THE NEEDS

03:13:49.050 --> 03:13:51.319
OF ADULT STUDENTS AND THE NEED

03:13:51.386 --> 03:13:54.689
OF FOLKS IN THE MARKETPLACE.

03:13:54.756 --> 03:13:56.057
JUST ADD.

03:13:56.124 --> 03:13:58.059
ANOTHER EXAMPLE MY COLLEAGUE

03:13:58.126 --> 03:13:59.427
MENTIONED.

03:13:59.494 --> 03:14:01.529
DIFFERENCE IN FEES IN COURSE

03:14:01.596 --> 03:14:02.764
FEES.

03:14:02.831 --> 03:14:04.366
THESE ARE TWO SYSTEMS ADULT

03:14:04.432 --> 03:14:06.301
EDUCATION COMMUNITY COLLEGES

03:14:06.368 --> 03:14:08.703
THAT BIT AND CO EXISTED IN KIND

03:14:08.770 --> 03:14:11.172
OF PARALLEL TRACKS.

03:14:11.239 --> 03:14:12.707
FOR DECADES AND NOW LET YOUR

03:14:12.774 --> 03:14:14.609
LEGISLATURE RECENTLY MADE THE

03:14:14.676 --> 03:14:16.444
DECISION. TO TO HAVE THEM WORK

03:14:16.511 --> 03:14:19.647
TOGETHER CONSORTIA AND TO TO

03:14:19.714 --> 03:14:20.982
LEVERAGE EACH OTHERS COMPARATIVE

03:14:21.049 --> 03:14:23.818
ADVANTAGES AND STRENGTH TO WORK

03:14:23.885 --> 03:14:24.319
TOGETHER.

03:14:24.386 --> 03:14:26.454
IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT AND IT'S

03:14:26.521 --> 03:14:28.323
AND THERE STILL ARE INEQUITIES

03:14:28.390 --> 03:14:30.025
AROUND THE STATE FOR STUDENTS

03:14:30.091 --> 03:14:31.626
BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T FULLY AID AS

03:14:31.693 --> 03:14:33.061
A STATE WE HAVEN'T FULLY

03:14:33.128 --> 03:14:34.763
INTEGRATED.

03:14:34.829 --> 03:14:36.631
THESE PROVIDERS YOU TO BE ABLE

03:14:36.698 --> 03:14:38.033
TO WORK TOGETHER AN EXAMPLE IS

03:14:38.099 --> 03:14:39.634
WITH THE COURSE FEES STICKING

03:14:39.701 --> 03:14:41.036
WITH THE EXAMPLE OF THE

03:14:41.102 --> 03:14:42.237
CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT.

03:14:42.303 --> 03:14:46.341
PROGRAM [inaudible] FOUR

03:14:46.408 --> 03:14:47.709
COMMUNITY COLLEGES THEIR NON

03:14:47.776 --> 03:14:50.011
CREDIT ADULT INSTRUCTION THEY

03:14:50.078 --> 03:14:52.313
ARE PROHIBITED BY LAW FROM

03:14:52.380 --> 03:14:54.315
CHARGING COURSE FEES.

03:14:54.382 --> 03:14:57.852
WERE AS FOR FOR ANY OF THOSE

03:14:57.919 --> 03:15:01.423
ADULT EDUCATION COURSES BUT FOR

03:15:01.489 --> 03:15:04.025
FOR THE K. TWELVE ADULT SCHOOLS

03:15:04.092 --> 03:15:05.393
THEY ARE PERMITTED TO CHARGE

03:15:05.460 --> 03:15:06.895
COURSE FEES FOR CORRECT

03:15:06.961 --> 03:15:08.396
TECHNICAL EDUCATION.

03:15:08.463 --> 03:15:09.864
SO FOR A CERTIFIED NURSING

03:15:09.931 --> 03:15:12.067
ASSISTANT YOU ARE SOMETHING WE

03:15:12.133 --> 03:15:14.269
LOOK AT IS YOU GO -- TO SAY LONG

03:15:14.335 --> 03:15:16.771
BEACH AND A CERTIFIED NURSING

03:15:16.838 --> 03:15:18.673
ASSISTANT PROGRAM AT LONG BEACH

03:15:18.740 --> 03:15:19.574
CITY COLLEGE -- NEARBY

03:15:19.641 --> 03:15:21.810
COMMUNICORP WHICH WOULD BE FREE

03:15:21.876 --> 03:15:23.411
TO THAT STUDENT BUT IF THEY GO

03:15:23.478 --> 03:15:24.846
THROUGH THE ADULT SCHOOL COULD

03:15:24.913 --> 03:15:25.880
COST.

03:15:25.947 --> 03:15:29.017
A THOUSAND MORE DOLLARS IN FEES

03:15:29.084 --> 03:15:30.118
TO GO THROUGH THAT PROGRAM.

03:15:30.185 --> 03:15:32.053
IN IN THE SAME AREA ANY ADULT

03:15:32.120 --> 03:15:33.688
SCHOOLS WILL TELL YOU NOT THEY

03:15:33.755 --> 03:15:35.023
DON'T CHARGE BECAUSE THEY WANT

03:15:35.090 --> 03:15:36.491
TO THE CHARGE BECAUSE THEY DO

03:15:36.558 --> 03:15:38.326
NOT GET AS MUCH MONEY STATE

03:15:38.393 --> 03:15:41.362
MONEY. FOR INSTRUCTION AS THE

03:15:41.429 --> 03:15:43.198
COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

03:15:43.264 --> 03:15:44.999
TO AS MY COLLEAGUE.

03:15:45.066 --> 03:15:46.668
MISS KING MENTIONED.

03:15:46.734 --> 03:15:49.337
YOU DO NOT HAVE WE DO NOT HAVE A

SET AMOUNT.

03:15:50.738 --> 03:15:52.107
PER STUDENT A STANDARD AMOUNT

03:15:52.173 --> 03:15:54.142
PER STUDENT CURRENTLY IN THE

03:15:54.209 --> 03:15:55.477
COMMITTEE COLLEGES VERSUS ADULTS%

03:15:55.543 --> 03:15:56.911
SCHOOLS YOU HAVE WERE ALL OVER

03:15:56.978 --> 03:15:58.513
THE MAP ON ON THE ADULT SCHOOLS

03:15:58.580 --> 03:16:00.648
AND WHAT THEY GET FUNDED NOT

03:16:00.715 --> 03:16:01.850
IT'S NOT.

03:16:01.916 --> 03:16:02.951
EIGHTY EIGHT RIGHT CORRECT THEY

03:16:03.017 --> 03:16:04.819
GET THEY GET A AN AMOUNT TO THE

03:16:04.886 --> 03:16:06.254
CONSORTIUM THE CONSORTIUM

03:16:06.321 --> 03:16:07.555
DECIDES.

03:16:07.622 --> 03:16:09.224
HOW MUCH THE PROVIDERS GET THE

03:16:09.290 --> 03:16:10.692
PROVIDERS?

03:16:10.758 --> 03:16:12.660
A SERVICE STUDENTS THEY CAN

03:16:12.727 --> 03:16:14.696
SERVE AS MANY AS THEY CAN.

03:16:14.762 --> 03:16:16.131
IN ANY WITH THE ADULT SCHOOLS

03:16:16.197 --> 03:16:17.699
AND SO YOU REALLY DO HAVE

03:16:17.765 --> 03:16:18.766
DIFFERENCES DIFFERENT

03:16:18.833 --> 03:16:20.602
EXPERIENCES DIFFERENT FEES

03:16:20.668 --> 03:16:21.436
CHARGED DIFFERENT FUNDING

03:16:21.503 --> 03:16:24.339
AMOUNTS PROVIDED TO THE TO THE

03:16:24.405 --> 03:16:25.640
ADULT EDUCATION.

03:16:25.707 --> 03:16:27.809
ENTITIES JUST DEPENDING ON

03:16:27.876 --> 03:16:28.943
WHETHER THEY'RE AN ADULT SCHOOL

03:16:29.010 --> 03:16:30.612
COMMUNICATION WHERE THEY ARE SO

03:16:30.678 --> 03:16:32.046
JUST ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF SOME OF

03:16:32.113 --> 03:16:33.982
THE INEQUITIES THAT EVENTUALLY

03:16:34.048 --> 03:16:35.350
LEGISLATURES GONNA NEED TO

03:16:35.416 --> 03:16:36.684
GRAPPLE WITH I THINK.

03:16:36.751 --> 03:16:38.820
TO WE THINK IN ORDER TO TO

03:16:38.887 --> 03:16:39.888
REALLY HAVE A SYSTEM THAT'S

03:16:39.954 --> 03:16:41.489
COHESIVE COHERENT WORKING

03:16:41.556 --> 03:16:42.991
TOGETHER IN A COLLABORATIVE WAY

03:16:43.057 --> 03:16:44.192
SO IS THE SOLUTION TO

03:16:44.259 --> 03:16:45.760
STANDARDIZE THE APPROACH OR TO

03:16:45.827 --> 03:16:47.295
GIVE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IS

03:16:47.362 --> 03:16:48.329
THE SAME DISCRETION THAT THE

03:16:48.396 --> 03:16:50.098
CASE YOU TWELVE OPERATION AND WE

03:16:50.165 --> 03:16:51.399
THINK THEY DID.

03:16:51.466 --> 03:16:52.934
THE BEST WAY FORWARD WOULD BE TO

03:16:53.001 --> 03:16:54.302
STANDARDIZE THE FEET TO THE TO

03:16:54.369 --> 03:16:56.237
ASSURE THE ADULT SCHOOLS THAT

03:16:56.304 --> 03:16:57.172
THEY'RE GOING TO GET A CERTAIN

03:16:57.238 --> 03:16:58.773
AMOUNT OF FINDING.

03:16:58.840 --> 03:17:00.308
OF GENERAL FUND AMOUNT AND

03:17:00.375 --> 03:17:01.509
HAVING MORE MORE THE

03:17:01.576 --> 03:17:03.044
STANDARDIZATION LIKE WE HAVE

03:17:03.111 --> 03:17:06.981
CURRENTLY WITH CANELO SHE'S

03:17:07.048 --> 03:17:07.515
UNITY COLLEGES TO RECOVER

03:17:07.582 --> 03:17:07.815
[inaudible]

03:17:07.882 --> 03:17:08.583
COST.

03:17:08.650 --> 03:17:09.384
WELL CURRENTLY THE COMMUNITY

03:17:09.450 --> 03:17:12.020
COLLEGES GET ENOUGH FUNDING.

03:17:12.086 --> 03:17:13.655
FROM THE STATE AND AND AND AND

03:17:13.721 --> 03:17:15.323
JUST OVERALL FUNDING THAT THEY

03:17:15.390 --> 03:17:18.359
CAN PROVIDE INSTRUCTION SERVICES

03:17:18.426 --> 03:17:19.227
STUDENTS WITHOUT CHARGING THAT

03:17:19.294 --> 03:17:21.996
FEE WHERE IS THE ADULT SCHOOLS.

03:17:22.063 --> 03:17:24.165
NOT NECESSARILY THE CASE THEY

03:17:24.232 --> 03:17:26.768
HAVE TO CHARGE FEES. TO TO MAKE

03:17:26.834 --> 03:17:29.470
UP FOR THAT THE LACK OF FUNDING

03:17:29.537 --> 03:17:30.905
ARE CURRENTLY GETTING IN MANY

03:17:30.972 --> 03:17:33.675
CASES.

03:17:33.741 --> 03:17:34.242
I'LL LEAVE THAT TO THE FIRST

03:17:34.309 --> 03:17:36.978
FLOOR.

03:17:37.045 --> 03:17:38.680
ANYTHING ELSE.

03:17:38.746 --> 03:17:40.648
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN.

03:17:40.715 --> 03:17:42.250

QUESTIONS I APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR

03:17:44.752 --> 03:17:46.187
PRESENTATION AND LOOK FORWARD TO

03:17:46.254 --> 03:17:47.922
FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THIS

03:17:47.989 --> 03:17:55.263
ISSUE THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:57.031
LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE A PUBLIC

03:17:57.098 --> 03:18:00.401
COMMENT.

03:18:00.468 --> 03:18:16.651
LIKE A REAL

03:18:24.025 --> 03:18:24.192
[inaudible]

03:18:24.259 --> 03:18:26.861
OKAY.

03:18:26.928 --> 03:18:28.396
EVERYBODY CUED UP SO THIS IS A

03:18:28.463 --> 03:18:31.899
PUBLIC COMMENT I NORMALLY DON'T --

03:18:31.966 --> 03:18:34.535
SET TIME LIMITS BUT I WOULD ASK

03:25:33.487 --> 03:25:34.522
WORK FORCE.

03:25:34.588 --> 03:25:35.990
WE THINK THOUGH TO HOLD THESE

03:25:36.057 --> 03:25:37.858
DOLLARS ACCOUNTABLE THERE NEEDS

03:25:37.925 --> 03:25:40.294

THEY NO LONGER HAVE THAT

03:25:47.868 --> 03:25:49.270
CAPACITY.

03:25:49.336 --> 03:25:50.538

03:25:50.604 --> 03:25:52.807
PUSHING FOR ONE SIDE OF THE COIN

03:25:52.873 --> 03:25:54.842
IS THE DOLLARS THE OTHER SIDE IS

COALITION OR COALITION HAS BEEN

03:26:06.220 --> 03:26:07.722
VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE C. T.

INCENTIVE CURRENT PROGRAM OVER

03:26:09.223 --> 03:26:09.957
THE YEARS.

THROUGH SEE TECH.

03:26:15.830 --> 03:26:17.331
WE BELIEVE THAT C. TAKE HAS BEEN

03:26:17.398 --> 03:26:18.933
SUCCESSFUL IN PROVIDING ONGOING

03:26:18.999 --> 03:26:21.035
FUNDING TO K. TWELVE PROGRAMS

03:26:21.102 --> 03:26:22.703
WITH ANNUAL ACCOUNTABILITY THAT

03:26:22.770 --> 03:26:24.105
ENABLES US TO MAINTAIN.

03:26:24.171 --> 03:26:25.673
AND IMPROVE CT PROGRAM

03:26:25.740 --> 03:26:27.341
SYSTEMATICALLY IN A WAY THAT THE

03:26:27.408 --> 03:26:28.476
INCENTIVE GRANT WAS.

03:26:28.542 --> 03:26:29.910
ON DESIGNS AND WE ALSO BELIEVE

03:26:29.977 --> 03:26:31.378
THAT THE C. TAKE METRICS ARE

03:26:31.445 --> 03:26:33.047
CLEAR IN FOCUS ON THE ELEMENTS

03:26:33.114 --> 03:26:34.982
THAT MAKE UP HIGH QUALITY CTP

03:26:35.049 --> 03:26:36.584
WHICH INCLUDES RELATIONSHIPS

03:26:36.650 --> 03:26:38.419
WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES. FOR

ARTICULATION DUAL ENROLLMENT

03:26:39.553 --> 03:26:40.554
ETCETERA.

03:26:40.621 --> 03:26:41.922
THE STRONG WORK FORCE PROGRAM IN

03:26:41.989 --> 03:26:43.357
THE MEANTIME WE BELIEVE HAS ONLY

03:26:43.424 --> 03:26:45.292
ADDED ANOTHER LAYER OF

03:26:45.359 --> 03:26:46.761
BUREAUCRACY THAT DOESN'T DO.

03:26:46.827 --> 03:26:48.295
AND THAT DOES NOT ADD VALUE TO

03:26:48.362 --> 03:26:50.631
HIGHLY EFFECTIVE SEE TV PROGRAMS.

03:26:50.698 --> 03:26:52.933
AND WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS

03:26:53.000 --> 03:26:55.202
ABOUT THE GROUND METRICS WHICH

03:26:55.269 --> 03:26:55.836
ARE THE SAME AS THE COMMUNITY

03:26:55.903 --> 03:26:57.238
COLLEGE STRONG WORKFORCE PROGRAM

03:26:57.304 --> 03:26:59.039
METRICS WHAT THAT MEANS FOR K.

03:26:59.106 --> 03:26:59.907
TWELVE PROGRAMS.

03:26:59.974 --> 03:27:01.442
IS THAT THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

03:27:01.509 --> 03:27:03.077
PROGRAMS WILL BE DEMONSTRATED

03:27:03.144 --> 03:27:05.012
FOR MANY YEARS SOMETIMES AS MANY

03:27:05.079 --> 03:27:06.547
AS FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS BECAUSE

03:27:06.614 --> 03:27:08.215
THE METRICS OCCUR ONLY AFTER

03:27:08.282 --> 03:27:09.650
STUDENT COMPLETES COMMUNITY

03:27:09.717 --> 03:27:10.151
COLLEGE.

03:27:10.217 --> 03:27:12.219
AND FINALLY HAT -- THE CATO

03:27:12.286 --> 03:27:17.625
STRONG WORK FIRST PROGRAM

03:27:17.691 --> 03:27:19.593
METRICS ALSO.

03:27:19.660 --> 03:27:20.694
DO NOT AND CONSIDER STUDENTS TO

03:27:20.761 --> 03:27:21.162
ENROLL IN UNIVERSITY

03:27:21.228 --> 03:27:21.729
APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ARE

03:27:21.796 --> 03:27:22.296
OTHER PATHWAYS OUTSIDE OF

03:27:22.363 --> 03:27:22.930
COMMUNITY COLLEGE AFTER THEY'VE

03:27:22.997 --> 03:27:24.431
COMPLETED HIGH SCHOOL THANK YOU.

03:27:24.498 --> 03:27:26.734
THANK YOU SIR.

03:27:26.801 --> 03:27:28.269
I AM A COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY

03:27:28.335 --> 03:27:30.571
MEMBER -- I TEACH MATH -- AT

03:27:30.638 --> 03:27:32.239
YOUR BOW COLLEGE IN HAYWARD MY

03:27:32.306 --> 03:27:34.208
NAME IS DAVE OKAY I'M ALSO THE

03:27:34.275 --> 03:27:36.076
PRESIDENT OF THE SHIP -- LAST

03:27:36.143 --> 03:27:37.511
PROCEED AS FACULTY ASSOCIATION.

03:27:37.578 --> 03:27:38.712
I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT THE

03:27:38.779 --> 03:27:40.247
FUNDING FORMULA AND SPECIFICALLY

03:27:40.314 --> 03:27:41.682
THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION

03:27:41.749 --> 03:27:43.050
APART THAT'S BASED ON FINANCIAL

03:27:43.117 --> 03:27:43.918
AID.

03:27:43.984 --> 03:27:45.286
AND I APPRECIATE THE DESIRE TO

03:27:45.352 --> 03:27:46.787
DEVOTE 20% OF FUNDING TO

03:27:46.854 --> 03:27:48.489
RECOGNIZE AND SUPPORT LOW INCOME

03:27:48.556 --> 03:27:49.390
STUDENTS.

03:27:49.456 --> 03:27:51.926
BUT 20% IS A VERY LARGE SLICE

03:27:51.992 --> 03:27:52.960
GIVEN THAT IT WAS SET UP IN

03:27:53.027 --> 03:27:54.228
ESSENTIALLY TO ROB PETER TO PAY

03:27:54.295 --> 03:27:55.362
PAUL.

03:27:55.429 --> 03:27:56.530
AND I ASK YOU TO WRAP YOUR BRAIN

03:27:56.597 --> 03:27:58.265
AROUND THE IDEA THAT UNDER.

03:27:58.332 --> 03:28:00.034
THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION SOME

03:28:00.100 --> 03:28:02.303
DISTRICTS WILL LOSE AS MUCH AS

03:28:02.369 --> 03:28:03.737
10% OF THEIR TOTAL FUNDING.

03:28:03.804 --> 03:28:05.306
WHILE OTHERS WILL GAIN AS MUCH

03:28:05.372 --> 03:28:07.007
AS A 10% WHEN FULL THAT IS

03:28:07.074 --> 03:28:09.143
ALMOST A 20% SWING IN THE

03:28:09.210 --> 03:28:10.711
NUMBERS THAT I PASSED OUT OR TO

03:28:10.778 --> 03:28:11.912
TO SUPPORT THAT CLAIM.

03:28:11.979 --> 03:28:13.514
THE LOSER DISTRICTS TEND TO BE

03:28:13.581 --> 03:28:15.816
IN HIGH CST REGIONS -- WHERE IT

03:28:15.883 --> 03:28:17.451
IS HARDER FOR STUDENTS TO

03:28:17.518 --> 03:28:19.119
QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID -- AND

03:28:19.186 --> 03:28:21.055
THAT IS IT IS THE CASE EVENWHEN

03:28:21.121 --> 03:28:22.223
STUDENTS.

03:28:22.289 --> 03:28:23.490
WE STILL HAVE STUDENTS WHO DON'T

03:28:23.557 --> 03:28:24.959
QUALIFY FOR FINANCIAL AID EVEN

03:28:25.025 --> 03:28:25.993
THOUGH THEY FACE FOOD AND

03:28:26.060 --> 03:28:28.229
HOUSING AND SECURITY SO THERE'S

03:28:28.295 --> 03:28:29.129
A BIG DISCONNECT THERE THAT WERE

03:28:29.196 --> 03:28:29.496
THERE.

03:28:29.563 --> 03:28:30.865
IS STILL EXIST AND IT DOESN'T

03:28:30.931 --> 03:28:32.166
LOOK LIKE IT'S GONNA GET CLOSE

03:28:32.233 --> 03:28:34.168
BY THE FUNDING FORMULA.

03:28:34.235 --> 03:28:35.836
BUT IN HIGH COST REGIONS THOSE

03:28:35.903 --> 03:28:37.104
DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE HIGHER

03:28:37.171 --> 03:28:38.973
STAFFING COSTS AND WHILE MOST OF

03:28:39.039 --> 03:28:40.040
THESE DISTRICTS ARE ON HOLD

03:28:40.107 --> 03:28:41.542
HARMLESS FOR THE MOMENT -- THE

03:28:41.609 --> 03:28:43.777
CLIFF IS LOOMING IF THIS FLAW IS

03:28:43.844 --> 03:28:45.112
NOT FIXED MANY OF THESE

03:28:45.179 --> 03:28:46.213
DISTRICTS WILL BE FORCED INTO

03:28:46.280 --> 03:28:48.182
DRACONIAN CUTS AND ALL OF THEIR

03:28:48.249 --> 03:28:49.683
STUDENTS WILL SUFFER INCLUDING

03:28:49.750 --> 03:28:50.551
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF

03:28:50.618 --> 03:28:51.318
STUDENTS.

03:28:51.385 --> 03:28:53.120
WITH THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION

03:28:53.187 --> 03:28:55.155
WAS INTENDED TO SUPPORT NOW I'VE

03:28:55.222 --> 03:28:56.323
DONE SOME WORK ON AS A MATH GUY

03:28:56.390 --> 03:28:58.325
DO AT WORK ANALYZING BUDGETS FOR

03:28:58.392 --> 03:29:00.160
DISTRICT AND SO ON I'VE ACTUALLY

03:29:00.227 --> 03:29:01.562
TRIED MODELING SOME SUPPOSE IT'S

03:29:01.629 --> 03:29:04.164
IMPOSSIBLE FIXES TO THIS PROBLEM

03:29:04.231 --> 03:29:04.899
AND IT'S ACTUALLY NOT THAT HARD

03:29:04.965 --> 03:29:05.766
TO DO.

03:29:05.833 --> 03:29:06.734
I MEAN OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A PRICE

03:29:06.800 --> 03:29:08.669
TAG ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT I I

03:29:08.736 --> 03:29:10.671
ACTUALLY BELIEVE THAT THE THE

03:29:10.738 --> 03:29:13.040
COST FOR FIXING THIS IS LESLIE

03:29:13.107 --> 03:29:15.342
VAN EXTENDING THE CURRENT HOLD

03:29:15.409 --> 03:29:16.777
HARMLESS IN PERPETUITY.

03:29:16.844 --> 03:29:17.978
SO THEY CAN BE DONE FOR LESS

03:29:18.045 --> 03:29:19.680
COST THAN THAT -- BUT I THINK WE

03:29:19.747 --> 03:29:21.148
HAVE TO FIX THIS OTHERWISE A LOT

03:29:21.215 --> 03:29:22.316
OF STUDENTS WILL SUFFER.

03:29:22.383 --> 03:29:24.084
THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU

03:29:24.151 --> 03:29:29.523
FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME DOWN

03:29:29.590 --> 03:29:30.925
AND TALK TO US.

03:29:30.991 --> 03:29:32.092

EXCELLENT -- AND THOROUGH

03:29:34.728 --> 03:29:36.063
ANALYSIS MY NAME IS LIZ THAT

03:29:36.130 --> 03:29:37.164
NEVER IT AND WITH THE MYTHOLOGY

03:29:37.231 --> 03:29:37.665
CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING

03:29:37.731 --> 03:29:39.733
CALIFORNIA IN COLLEGE DISTRICTS --

03:29:39.800 --> 03:29:40.935
WE FIRST ONE IN A MENTION THAT

03:29:41.001 --> 03:29:42.303
WE ARE VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE

03:29:42.369 --> 03:29:44.238
STRONG COAL THAT IS PROVIDED AND

03:29:44.305 --> 03:29:45.906
APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION'S

03:29:45.973 --> 03:29:47.875
APPROACH -- TO PERSON STIRS

03:29:47.942 --> 03:29:51.011
SPECIFICALLY THAT PERSON THE

03:29:51.078 --> 03:29:52.479
SISTERS CONTRIBUTION -- AND WE

03:29:52.546 --> 03:29:53.314
SUPPORT THOSE MEASURES WE DO

03:29:53.380 --> 03:29:55.516
WANT -- TO MENTIONED THAT IN THE

03:29:55.582 --> 03:29:56.216
LETTER THAT WILL BE WE'VE

03:29:56.283 --> 03:29:58.585
PROVIDED THE OUTLINE A FEW

03:29:58.652 --> 03:30:01.822
SENSIBLE MODIFICATIONS TO THE US

03:30:01.889 --> 03:30:03.590
STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA.

03:30:03.657 --> 03:30:04.625
ONE OF THE KEY ONES THAT I WANT

03:30:04.692 --> 03:30:05.960
TO HIGHLIGHT IS THAT WE ARE

03:30:06.026 --> 03:30:07.294
RECOMMENDING THAT THE TOTAL

03:30:07.361 --> 03:30:10.264
COMPUTATIONAL REVENUE.

03:30:10.331 --> 03:30:10.831
FOR TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

03:30:10.898 --> 03:30:11.832
PLUS THE COLA BE ADOPTED AS A

03:30:11.899 --> 03:30:13.500
NEW BASE FOR DISTRICTS AS A WAY

03:30:13.567 --> 03:30:16.370
OF A STABILIZING DISTRICTS --

03:30:16.437 --> 03:30:19.573
FROWNED AT FUTURE LOSSES -- AND

03:30:19.640 --> 03:30:20.808
WE OUTLINE IF IF YOU OTHER

03:30:20.874 --> 03:30:22.743
MODIFICATIONS WERE ALSO VERY

03:30:22.810 --> 03:30:24.778
CONCERNED WITH A PROPERTY TAX

03:30:24.845 --> 03:30:27.281
REVENUE -- ESTIMATES THAT WERE

03:30:27.348 --> 03:30:28.649
HIGHER THAN WAS ACTUALLY

03:30:28.716 --> 03:30:30.017
ALLOCATED TO DISTRICTS AND WE

03:30:30.084 --> 03:30:31.685
HOPE THAT THE MAY REVISE THAT

03:30:31.752 --> 03:30:33.921
CAN BE CORRECTED -- SO THAT CUTS

03:30:33.988 --> 03:30:36.423
TO SERVICES ARE NOT MADE -- AND

03:30:36.490 --> 03:30:38.158
THAT WE DON'T HURT STUDENTS THAT

03:30:38.225 --> 03:30:38.926
WERE ACTUALLY TRYING.

03:30:38.993 --> 03:30:39.460
TO HELP.

03:30:39.526 --> 03:30:40.961
AND THEN LASTLY I'LL MENTION

03:30:41.028 --> 03:30:42.997
THAT -- SIMILARLY TO YOU WE ARE

03:30:43.063 --> 03:30:44.732
VERY PERPLEXED WITH THE APPROACH

03:30:44.798 --> 03:30:46.800
THAT HAS BEEN TAKEN TO A

03:30:46.867 --> 03:30:48.469
FACILITY SPENDING AND THE SLOW

03:30:48.535 --> 03:30:51.872
RELEASE OF PROP FIFTY ONE

03:30:51.939 --> 03:30:52.773
RESOURCES.
