00:46:01.425 --> 00:46:03.794
ACTUALLY.

00:46:11.235 --> 00:46:12.703
I AM A FORMER PRODUCER FORMER

00:46:12.769 --> 00:46:14.138
DIRECTOR.

00:46:14.204 --> 00:46:15.639

THE MOVIE INDUSTRY.

00:46:42.599 --> 00:46:44.001

00:46:44.067 --> 00:46:45.435
ARE OTHER ALTERNATIVES THAT CAN

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:46.637

00:46:53.010 --> 00:46:54.845
HARMED THAT THE FILM DOES

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:56.480
ENCOURAGE SMOKING WHICH I

00:46:56.547 --> 00:46:58.081
BELIEVE AND BUT I JUST DON'T

00:46:58.148 --> 00:46:59.483
BELIEVE THAT.

00:46:59.550 --> 00:47:00.884
WE SHOULD BE IN A POSITION OF

00:47:00.951 --> 00:47:02.286
TELLING THE DIRECTOR PRODUCER

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:03.420

THAT YOU BRING THIS OFFICE IS

00:48:37.314 --> 00:48:38.682
THAT -- THE

00:48:38.749 --> 00:48:41.752
RATING SYSTEM IS NOT.

00:48:41.818 --> 00:48:44.321
A THAT CENSORSHIP SYSTEM IT'S

00:48:44.388 --> 00:48:46.790
ACTUALLY TO INFORM PARENTS RIGHT

00:48:46.857 --> 00:48:50.093
OF WHAT --

00:48:50.160 --> 00:48:50.961
WHAT --

00:48:51.028 --> 00:48:53.397
THERE'D THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT BE

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:55.432
EXPOSED TO RIGHT AND IT'S THE

00:48:55.499 --> 00:48:58.468
PARENTS TO JUDGE --

00:48:58.535 --> 00:49:00.370
WHAT THEY THINK IT'S ACCEPTABLE

00:49:00.437 --> 00:49:01.905
FOR THEIR CHILDREN TO WATCH SO I

00:49:01.972 --> 00:49:03.473
SEE A LOT OF UNDER THIRTEEN

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:04.541
CHILDREN SHOW BUT PEACHY

00:49:04.608 --> 00:49:07.577
THIRTEEN MOVIES --

00:49:07.644 --> 00:49:09.479
AND THAT SIR --

00:49:09.546 --> 00:49:10.614
AND I THINK THEY'LL TO CERTAIN

00:49:10.681 --> 00:49:12.316
EXTENT WILL HAVE IDEAS BE SURE --

00:49:12.382 --> 00:49:14.384
PARENTS THE RATING SYSTEM IS THE

00:49:14.451 --> 00:49:15.819
EXISTING SYSTEM THAT THE MOTION

00:49:15.886 --> 00:49:17.654
PICTURE INDUSTRY USES TO INFORM

00:49:17.721 --> 00:49:18.889
PARENTS OF THE PARENTS ARE AWARE

00:49:18.955 --> 00:49:20.123
OF WHAT THEIR CHILDREN MIGHT BE

00:49:20.190 --> 00:49:21.391
EXPOSED TO BEFORE.

00:49:21.458 --> 00:49:22.793
IN A MOVIE BEFORE THEY OF COURSE

00:49:22.859 --> 00:49:24.261
STEED MOVIE.

00:49:24.328 --> 00:49:24.895
AND THAT THAT'S WHY I THINK THIS

00:49:24.961 --> 00:49:26.930
IS A APPROPRIATE AND AS WAS

00:49:26.997 --> 00:49:28.398
MENTIONED BY MY WITNESSES AND

00:49:28.465 --> 00:49:29.733
WE'RE DOING THIS IS A RESOLUTION

00:49:29.800 --> 00:49:31.702
OR NOT DOING THIS IS A STATUTE

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.070
BECAUSE WE'RE HOPING THAT WE CAN

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:34.304
WORK WITH THE MOTION PICTURE

00:49:34.371 --> 00:49:35.472
INDUSTRY.

00:49:35.539 --> 00:49:37.541
RECOGNIZING THAT DEPICTIONS OF

00:49:37.607 --> 00:49:39.943
SMOKING OF EVIDENCE IS THERE TO

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:42.546
SHOWS THAT CAN CAUSE A REAL HARM

00:49:42.612 --> 00:49:44.081
AND SO WHY APPRECIATE.

00:49:44.147 --> 00:49:47.117
ARTISTRY I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO

00:49:47.184 --> 00:49:47.751
PEOPLE NEED BE WHERE THE PLATES

00:49:47.818 --> 00:49:50.020
OF CONSEQUENCES AND PARENTS NEED

00:49:50.087 --> 00:49:51.021
TO KNOW AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE

00:49:51.088 --> 00:49:52.189
SAYING THAT WE SHOULD DO THROUGH

00:49:52.255 --> 00:49:53.490
THE RATING SYSTEM WE'RE NOT

00:49:53.557 --> 00:49:55.492
TRYING TO LIMIT --

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:57.361
DIRECTORS FROM.

00:49:57.427 --> 00:49:59.329
WHAT THEY DECIDE TO FINALLY

00:49:59.396 --> 00:50:01.631
CHOOSE TO DO IN THE MOVIES?

00:50:01.698 --> 00:50:03.367
SO THE JUST AS A FOLLOW UP I WAS

00:50:03.433 --> 00:50:06.103
LOOKING IN THE THE TIME

00:50:06.169 --> 00:50:07.404
COMMITTEE REPORT AND IT WAS

00:50:07.471 --> 00:50:09.172
SAYING MENTIONING THAT BECAUSE I

00:50:09.239 --> 00:50:10.173

00:50:11.408 --> 00:50:14.177
STANDARD BUT IN TWO THOUSAND

00:50:14.244 --> 00:50:15.078
SEVEN ADULTS SMOKING WAS A

00:50:15.145 --> 00:50:16.880
FACTOR IN THE RATING SYSTEM AND

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:18.615
YOUTH SMOKING HAS ALWAYS BEEN

00:50:18.682 --> 00:50:20.050
CONSIDERED IN THEIR WAITING.

00:50:20.117 --> 00:50:21.551
SO WHY LIKE CONSIDER IT THAT'S

00:50:21.618 --> 00:50:24.521
WHY I WAS ASKING TO THEY LISTED.

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:25.922

ENTER.

00:51:18.842 --> 00:51:20.110
I ACTUALLY THINK.

00:51:20.177 --> 00:51:21.978
THAT THE MEMBER FROM LA --

00:51:22.045 --> 00:51:23.580

00:51:23.647 --> 00:51:24.514
AND WAS MUCH MORE ARTICULATE

00:51:24.581 --> 00:51:26.817
THAN THAN I WILL BE ON THIS --

00:51:26.883 --> 00:51:28.485
BUT I DO BELIEVE DOCTOR PAN THAT

00:51:28.552 --> 00:51:29.653

00:51:37.060 --> 00:51:38.995
PHILOSOPHICAL I'M I'M NOT SURE

00:51:39.062 --> 00:51:40.764
THAT IT THAT IT'S THE PLACE OF

00:51:40.831 --> 00:51:42.299
THE LEGISLATURE TO TO START TO

00:51:42.365 --> 00:51:44.601
GET INTO THESE SPEECH ISSUES.

00:51:44.668 --> 00:51:46.002

THOUGH I DON'T.

00:51:47.003 --> 00:51:48.772
IF I HAD CHILDREN I WOULD WANT

00:51:48.839 --> 00:51:51.141

00:51:51.208 --> 00:51:52.843
THAT IT WASN'T COOL TO TO SMOKE

00:51:52.909 --> 00:51:54.077

THAT IS A PHYSICIAN I KNOW THAT

00:53:07.851 --> 00:53:10.020
SMOKING IS A OBVIOUSLY IS

00:53:10.086 --> 00:53:11.388
VARIOUS.

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:12.522
IT IS A SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC AT

00:53:12.589 --> 00:53:14.190
ONE OF OUR MOST SERIOUS PUBLIC

00:53:14.257 --> 00:53:15.892
HEALTH ISSUES UMP THE REACHED

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:18.028
THAT THE DATA IS AND WHAT WE

00:53:18.094 --> 00:53:19.629
WANT IS IS THAT WE WANT.

00:53:19.696 --> 00:53:21.298
TO AND ASK THAT THE MOTION

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:23.033
PICTURE INDUSTRY BE ENGAGED.

00:53:23.099 --> 00:53:24.568
AND TRYING TO LIMIT EXPOSURE TO

00:53:24.634 --> 00:53:26.369
DEPICTIONS OF SMOKING BECAUSE WE

00:53:26.436 --> 00:53:28.171
KNOW IT CAN CAUSE ACTUAL HARM --

00:53:28.238 --> 00:53:30.073
SO -- I

00:53:30.140 --> 00:53:30.607
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:31.808
PARENTS ACTUALLY NO I MEAN THIS

00:53:31.875 --> 00:53:33.076
IS NOT ABOUT LIMITING ARTISTS

00:53:33.143 --> 00:53:34.377
EXPRESSION THIS IS ABOUT FUTURE

00:53:34.444 --> 00:53:35.946
PARENTS KNOW MANY OF US ARE

00:53:36.012 --> 00:53:37.013
PARENTS HERE.

00:53:37.080 --> 00:53:38.915
AND THAT WE SEND A CHILD. TO A

00:53:38.982 --> 00:53:40.216
MOVIE AND WE SEE RATING SYSTEM

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:41.685
WE OFTEN USE THE RATING SYSTEM

00:53:41.751 --> 00:53:42.953
IS A WAY TO HELP US JUDGE

00:53:43.019 --> 00:53:44.254
WHETHER OF MOVIES APPROPRIATE

00:53:44.321 --> 00:53:45.388
NOT FOR CHILDREN.

00:53:45.455 --> 00:53:47.390
OF WE AND SO I THINK IT'S

00:53:47.457 --> 00:53:49.092
APPROPRIATE FOR US --

00:53:49.159 --> 00:53:50.393

00:53:53.663 --> 00:53:55.599
PARENTS ARE AWARE AND ARE GIVEN

00:53:55.665 --> 00:53:57.968
THAT KIND OF INFORMATION THAT

00:53:58.034 --> 00:53:59.603
