THERE IS NO INCENTIVE FOR A PROPERTY OWNER ON THE COMMERCIAL SIDE TO TRY AND MOVE A TENANTS OUT OF THEIR SPACE RIGHT NOW- THERE'S NOT A HUGE LINE OF PEOPLE COMING IN AND THERE'S A SYMBIOTIC RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE COMMERCIAL AND THE- THAT LANDLORDS AND TENANTS HOWEVER THERE ARE SOME VERY SMALL COMPANIES THAT EVEN WITHOUT ASSISTANCE OR THEY MIGHT BE IN A PROPERTY WHERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING SOME HELP FROM THE LANDLORD. WHERE PROGRAMS LIKE THIS I WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL VERY APPRECIATED WE VERY MUCH LIKE THE CONCEPTS WITHIN AB ELEVEN FORTY SIX THIS IS VERY MUCH LIKE THE RESIDENTIAL PROGRAM THAT WAS VOTED ON AND PASSED EARLIER THIS YEAR AND LAST YEAR AND THAT IT HAPPENED FUNDING BEHIND IT IT WOULD DIRECTLY HELP LANDLORDS WHO ARE WORKING WITH THEIR TENANTS TO DO THINK THAT A PROGRAM LIKE THIS WILL BE HELPFUL TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PULLED OUT OF THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

A MANAGER YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS ECONOMIC DEVELOPERS FINANCE PROFESSIONALS AND EVEN THE OFFICE OF THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYSTS AGREE THAT SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY THE CORONA VIRUS PANDEMIC. AB FIFTEEN SEVENTY ONE A COMMITTEE BILL DELIVERS REGULATORY RELIEF TO SMALL BUSINESSES DURING A STATE OF EMERGENCY. BY EITHER EXEMPTING SMALL BUSINESSES FROM COMPLIANCE UNTIL AFTER THE STATE OF EMERGENCY OR IN THE CASE THAT REGULATION IS NECESSARY TO ADDRESS THE EMERGENCY OR SERIOUS AND IMMEDIATE HEALTH AND SAFETY ISSUE. PROVIDING SMALL BUSINESSES WITH SUFFICIENT TIME TO LEARN ABOUT AND IMPLEMENT ANY NEW REGULATION. ONE ESTIMATE IS THAT MORE THAN NINETEEN THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY CLOSED IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF WHICH WERE OWNED BY WOMEN AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE TAKE CONCRETE STEPS TO SUPPORT SMALL BUSINESSES DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS IS LIMITING NEW REGULATIONS TO ONLY THOSE THAT ARE MOST UNNECESSARY. IN THE CASE WERE NEW REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY AGENCIES THAT NEED TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE CHALLENGES SMALL BUSINESSES FACE. DURING EMERGENCY AGENCIES SHOULD CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE OUTREACH METHODS FACILITATING GROUP PURCHASING OR OF SCARCE PRODUCTS AND FUNDING SMALL BUSINESS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE PROVIDERS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. IN A DECLARED SAY OF A GOVERNMENT ROLE MAKING SHOULD NOT BE KIND- CONDUCTED IN A SMALL IN A BUSINESS AS USUAL MANNER. SO WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS MISTER PHILIP REMOVE ONE.
