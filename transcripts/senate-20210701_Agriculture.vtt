AND IS ALSO RECORD REFLECTED IN

00:10:26.759 --> 00:10:28.527
AB FORTY FIVE THE FARM BUREAU

THEIR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL SO

00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.869
WE'RE PLEASED TO REPORT THAT

00:10:36.936 --> 00:10:37.403
I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE REAL

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.371
QUICKLY THAT THERE'S THREE

00:10:38.437 --> 00:10:39.338
OBJECTIVES THAT WE'RE TRYING TO

GET TO WITH THIS BILL. NUMBER

00:10:41.207 --> 00:10:41.974
ONE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE

00:10:42.041 --> 00:10:44.110

WHICH IS WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW-

00:10:49.782 --> 00:10:51.117
IT PROVIDES A LOT OF CONSUMER

00:10:51.183 --> 00:10:52.218
SAFETY REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:54.787

IN A JUMPSTART AN INDUSTRY

00:10:59.258 --> 00:10:59.925
THAT'S GOING TO BE VERY

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:00.826
FRUITFUL FOR THE STATE OF

THE ISSUE THAT WE ALL AGREE ON.

00:11:32.391 --> 00:11:33.726
NUMBER TWO IS THAT THERE IS

00:11:33.793 --> 00:11:36.162

CALIFORNIA'S LATEST BABY NOT

00:43:18.329 --> 00:43:19.563
QUESTION THE CONSOLE BECAUSE IT

00:43:19.630 --> 00:43:20.631
SEEMS IN THE LANGUAGE OF THE

00:43:20.698 --> 00:43:22.433
BILL GIVES YOU OPTIONS THERE.

00:43:22.499 --> 00:43:31.875

00:43:35.879 --> 00:43:37.348
IS LINES IT HAS IT BUT THE WAY

00:43:37.414 --> 00:43:38.816
THE BILL IS WRITTEN IT SAYS

00:43:38.882 --> 00:43:39.850
THAT THAT SHOULD BE DECLARED BY

AN UNDERSTANDING- ON THE

OF. THE REASON WE'RE HERE

00:50:36.099 --> 00:50:39.336
TODAY. IS A LACK OF SPECIFICITY

00:50:39.403 --> 00:50:41.671
IN EXISTING LAW THAT CREATED A

00:50:41.738 --> 00:50:43.640

00:52:23.206 --> 00:52:25.275
YOUR ABILITY TO EXPLAIN THIS-

00:52:25.342 --> 00:52:28.445
AND WHERE YOU WANT TO GO THAT.

00:52:28.512 --> 00:52:30.247
ANY TIME THERE'S A DISAGREEMENT

00:52:30.313 --> 00:52:31.781
AND YOU END UP IN FRONT OF

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:32.582
SOMEBODY THAT'S GOING TO HAVE

00:52:32.649 --> 00:52:33.917
TO MAKE A DECISION AND IT'S

00:52:33.984 --> 00:52:37.921
USUALLY A JUDGE- THE STATUTORY

00:52:37.988 --> 00:52:39.890
CONSTRUCTION IS THAT WE MEAN

00:52:39.956 --> 00:52:41.858
EXACTLY WHAT THE WORDS MEAN AND

00:52:41.925 --> 00:52:43.159
THAT IF WE ADDED EXTRA WORDS WE

00:52:43.226 --> 00:52:44.895
MEANT THOSE EXTRA WORDS TO MEAN

00:52:44.961 --> 00:52:46.730
SOMETHING SO. I ALWAYS ERR ON

00:52:46.796 --> 00:52:48.598
IT ON THE SIDE OF LET'S MAKE IT

00:52:48.665 --> 00:52:52.936
SIMPLE. AND AND CLEAR AND I

00:52:53.003 --> 00:52:54.638
REALLY APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'RE

00:52:54.704 --> 00:52:55.972
TRYING TO DO ASSEMBLY MEMBER

00:52:56.039 --> 00:52:57.841
BECAUSE THE MORE THAT PEOPLE

00:52:57.908 --> 00:53:00.176
UNDERSTAND WHAT THEY'RE BUYING

00:53:00.243 --> 00:53:01.311
WHAT'S IN THE BOTTLE. THE

00:53:01.378 --> 00:53:05.482
BETTER IT IS- AND- SO I FRANKLY

00:53:05.549 --> 00:53:06.883
DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR THE

00:53:06.950 --> 00:53:07.984
ENTIRE SENTENCE BUT I AM

00:53:08.051 --> 00:53:11.755
PREPARED TO- TO- TO SUPPORT

00:53:11.821 --> 00:53:13.757
EITHER THAT OR OR THAT CONTINUE

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:14.491
GETTING RID OF THE WORDS

00:53:14.558 --> 00:53:16.326
CONTAINING SO- I DON'T KNOW FOR

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:18.628
MOTIONS BEEN MADE BUT- BUT IF

00:53:18.695 --> 00:53:21.197
IT HAS. IF IT HAS NOT- I'M

00:53:21.264 --> 00:53:22.265
PREPARED TO MAKE A MOTION THAT

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:23.833
WE JUST TAKE THE SENT TO SEND

00:53:23.900 --> 00:53:25.969
US OR WE ADVISE IT THAT'S WHAT

00:53:26.036 --> 00:53:27.203
WE THINK SHOULD BE DONE IT GOES

00:53:27.270 --> 00:53:27.704
TO ANOTHER COMMITTEE NOT

00:53:27.771 --> 00:53:29.439
CONNECTS COMMISSION OFF. OFF

00:53:29.506 --> 00:53:32.409
ALWAYS DECIDE WHETHER THEY LIKE

00:53:32.475 --> 00:53:33.009
IT IN THERE OR NOT I MEAN IT.

00:53:33.076 --> 00:53:35.879
IT'S NOT. I THINK THAT THERE'S

00:53:35.946 --> 00:53:39.082
ROOM FOR BOTH. BOTH OPTIONS BUT

00:53:39.149 --> 00:53:40.483
I THINK THE STATUTORY

00:53:40.550 --> 00:53:42.586
CONSTRUCTION IS SUCH THAT WE

00:53:42.652 --> 00:53:43.186
SHOULD JUST TAKE THE SENTENCE

00:53:43.253 --> 00:53:45.055
OUT. OKAY RECOMMEND I'M OKAY

00:53:45.121 --> 00:53:46.156
WITH THAT YEAH AND I THINK

00:53:46.222 --> 00:53:48.358
THAT'S THAT'S WEIRD THIS MATTER

00:53:48.425 --> 00:53:51.194
EVEN IN ITS LAST MINUTE-

00:53:51.261 --> 00:53:53.129
MANIFESTATION WHAT WE WERE

00:53:53.196 --> 00:53:55.899
EXPECTING THAT THIS PARTICULAR

00:53:55.966 --> 00:53:58.301
SHE WOULD PROBABLY BE RESOLVED-

00:53:58.368 --> 00:53:59.302
THROUGH THE NEXT THROUGH THE

00:53:59.369 --> 00:54:00.537
NEXT CMMITTEE HAVING GONE

00:54:00.604 --> 00:54:03.873
THROUGH SO MANY. CHANGES FROM

00:54:03.940 --> 00:54:06.209
THE ORIGINAL DRAFT SO I THINK

00:54:06.276 --> 00:54:06.977
YOU CAN KIND OF GET A SENSE

00:54:07.043 --> 00:54:11.381
THAT- BASED ON THE COMMENTS

00:54:11.448 --> 00:54:11.948
THAT I'VE HEARD THAT TO WORK

00:54:12.015 --> 00:54:15.118
CONTAINS. IS SUPERFLUOUS BOND

00:54:15.185 --> 00:54:17.420
IN PERCENTAGE CALIFORNIA OLIVE

00:54:17.487 --> 00:54:20.557
OIL IS- APPROPRIATE. BUT I

00:54:20.624 --> 00:54:22.058
WOULD LEAVE IT TO THE AUTHOR

00:54:22.125 --> 00:54:25.228
ODD TO RESOLVE. THIS VERY VERY

00:54:25.295 --> 00:54:27.597
SMALL ISSUE COMPARED TO WHERE

00:54:27.664 --> 00:54:29.399
WE STARTED FROM. AS IT MOVES

00:54:29.466 --> 00:54:31.935
THROUGH ON THE NEXT COMMITTEE

00:54:32.002 --> 00:54:32.936
ANY OTHER FOR ANY OTHER

00:54:33.003 --> 00:54:35.538
COMMENTS. AND MISSOURI I WOULD

00:54:35.605 --> 00:54:37.140
JUST NOTE THAT. THE SENTENCE

00:54:37.207 --> 00:54:38.808
ABOVE TALKS ABOUT THE MINIMUM

00:54:38.875 --> 00:54:39.442
PERCENTAGE WHICH I ALWAYS

00:54:39.509 --> 00:54:41.344
THOUGHT WAS A- SAFER PHRASE

00:54:41.411 --> 00:54:42.479
MYSELF BECAUSE OF THE GOOD

00:54:42.545 --> 00:54:44.014
PROTECTED THE- PRODUCER FROM

00:54:44.080 --> 00:54:45.582
ANY KIND OF LITIGATION THAT WAS

00:54:45.649 --> 00:54:47.751

SENSES EXTRA. IT KIND OF ITS

00:54:52.989 --> 00:54:54.591
VISIT I THINK TOO PRESCRIPTIVE

00:54:54.658 --> 00:54:55.959
I THINK THAT IT DOES REQUIRE

00:54:56.026 --> 00:54:57.360
THE MINIMUM PERCENTAGE OF OLIVE

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:59.529
OIL AND THE SIZE AS THE WORD

00:54:59.596 --> 00:55:00.764
CALIFORNIA GETS A VERY CLEAR

00:55:00.830 --> 00:55:03.199

CLARIFICATION OF WHAT'S ABOVE.

00:55:25.922 --> 00:55:28.491

00:55:32.762 --> 00:55:35.699
ACTUALLY RIGHT SO- FROM THERE

00:55:35.765 --> 00:55:38.601
AND- I WOULD JUST SAY IT TO DO

00:55:38.668 --> 00:55:40.003
A BEHOLDEN ON THE FLYBRIDGE OF

00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:40.937
THIS ARE GOING TO BE A

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:41.805

EVENTUALLY THERE WAS A- A

00:58:30.073 --> 00:58:31.474
COMPROMISE BILL THAT I THINK

00:58:31.541 --> 00:58:33.643

HAVE SINCE REVISED POLITICAL

00:59:00.536 --> 00:59:03.907
