IN ANY INDIVIDUAL WHOSE DESTRUCTIVE MAY BE REMOVED FROM THE HEARING ROOM OR FROM THE REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVE THE CONNECTIONS MUTED. SO BEFORE WE GET OUR PRESENTERS- TO INTRODUCE THE TOPIC I'LL MAKE A NOTE THAT WAS JUST TWO YEARS AGO ON JANUARY TWENTY SIX TWENTY TWENTY. THE CDC CONFIRM THE VERY FIRST CASE A COMB IT IN CALIFORNIA. AND ON FEBRUARY SIXTH TWENTY TWENTY A PERSON FROM SAN JOSE BECAME THE FIRST COPA DATA IN THE UNITED STATES DUE TO MYOCARDITIS FROM THE NOVEL CORONAVIRUS INFECTION. AND IN A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS THE CDC HAS REPORTED AS OF YESTERDAY. SEVENTY NINE MILLION A 1-006-500-0300 EIGHT KOBE CASES IN THE UNITED STATES. AND. NINE HUNDRED FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY TWO CONFIRMED DEATHS FROM COPD NINETEEN. THIS INCLUDES OVER ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN. YOUR BID OVER A MILLION EXCESS DEATHS IN THE U. S. DURING THE PANDEMIC. NOW GIVEN THE HORRIFYING NUMBERS A PANDEMIC DEATHS MUCH OF THE FOCUS ON ADDRESSING THE PANDEMIC HAS BEEN. ON INCREASING THE DEATH TOLL DUE TO THE CORONA VIRUS OR DUE TO OVERWHELMED HOSPITALS AND INTENSIVE CARE UNITS. HOWEVER DEATH AND HOSPITALIZATIONS ARE NOT THE ONLY SERIOUS CONSEQUENCE OF KOBE LEAD TO HIGHER RATES OF PERSISTENT DISABILITY SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS LONG COATED. RECENTLY THE UNITED KINGDOM THE OFFICE OF NATIONAL STATISTICS SHOW THAT A RAPID RISE IN THERE WAS A RAPID RISE IN LONG TERM ILLNESS IN PEOPLE AGED SIXTEEN TO SIXTY FOUR OF THE LAST TWO YEARS. WITH MORE THAN A THIRD OF THE WORKING AGE PEOPLE IN THE UNITED KINGDOM SUFFERING FROM LONG TERM ILLNESS. THE STUDIES ALONG KOVAN INDICATE THAT OVER A QUARTER OFPEOPLE INFECTED WITH KOBE. DEVELOP ONE OR MORE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS LASTING MONTHS SOMETIMES. EVEN GREATER SIX MONTHS AFTER INFECTION. INCLUDINGPEOPLE WHO WERE INITIALLY ASYMPTOMATIC ONLY HAD MILD ACUTE SYMPTOMS. SO IN ADDITION TO THAT WHAT IS THE RESEARCH REVEALING ABOUT THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES OF BEING INFECTED WITH THIS CORONAVIRUS. MANY PATIENTS REPORT NEW OR ONGOING NEUROLOGICAL SYMPTOMS AFTER COVE INFECTION INCLUDING CHANGES IN SMELL OR TASTE BRAIN FOG INCLUDING REDUCED ATTENTION AND MEMORY FATIGUE HEADACHE MUSCLE PAIN SLEEP PROBLEMS DIZZINESS AND MOOD CHANGES. A RECENT OXFORD STUDY OF BRAIN SCANS TAKEN BEFORE AND AFTER CO INFECTION FOUND BRAIN SHRINKAGE. AND COGNITIVE FUNCTION DEFICITS ALSO BEEN LAND LINKED WITH NEW PSYCHOTIC EPISODES IN PATIENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE SEVERE ACUTE LUNG DAMAGE REQUIRED PROLONGED VENTILATION INTENSIVE CARE ECMO OR EVEN DOUBLE LUNG TRANSPLANT THE ONES WE HEAR ABOUT. THE NINETEEN CAN ALSO CAUSE LONG TERM LUNG DAMAGE RESULTING IN PERSISTENT SHORTNESS OF BREATH. THE STUDY OF VETERAN AFFAIRS THE ISSUE OF THE CODE FACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH AN INCREASE IN TWENTY CARDIO VASCULAR PROBLEMS OVER A YEAR AFTER INITIAL INFECTION. EVEN IN PATIENTS WITH MILD DISEASE OR WHO ARE AT LOW RISK OF CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE. THE RISK OF HEART FAILURE INCREASED BY 72% HEART ATTACKS BY 63% MYOCARDITIS BY 510038% IN STROKE BY 52% QURBAN MAY ALSO-TRIGGER ON GOING AUTO IMMUNE RESPONSE CHRONIC INFLAMMATION. THE FACT OVER SEVEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED CHILDREN DEVELOP THIS YEAR'S CONDITION CALLED MULTI SYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME IN CHILDREN SOMETIMES KNOWN AS M. I. S. C. SIXTY THREE CHILDREN. WE'VE GOTTEN IN MY S. C. HAVE DIED. IN FACT THE MAJORITY OF M. I. S. T. PATIENTS ARE LATINO OR BLACK. M. I. C. M. I. S. C. AS A CONDITION. FOLLOW FOLLOWING COINFECTION WHERE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE BODY BECOME INFLAMED TO CLEAN THE HEART LUNGS KIDNEYS BRAIN AND SKIN EYES AND GOT. NOW DIABETES IS A RISK FACTOR FOR COVER NINETEEN INCUMBENT INFECTIONS BEEN ASSOCIATED WORSENING DIABETES SYMPTOMS. HOWEVER CHILDREN WHO HAVE BEEN INFECTED WITH COVE IT ALSO BEEN OBSERVED TO BE MORE THAN TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE DIAGNOSED WITH DIABETES. PREGNANT WOMEN AT HIGH RISK FOR SEVERE DISEASE UNTIL THE NINETEEN UNTIL THE INFECTION IN PREGNANT WOMEN ASSOCIATE WITH A THREE FOLD INCREASE IN STILLBIRTH. AS WELL AS A FIVE TIME RISK OF DEATH FOR THE WOMAN HERSELF. IN ADDITION COVER NINETEEN AFFECTION PREGNANT WOMEN'S ASSOCIATE WITH INCREASED RATES OF VERY PRETERM BIRTH WITH RESULTING IN INCREASED RISK OF INFANT COMPLICATIONS. NOW THERE'S BEEN A MINUTE THAT KOBE BAXEEN MAYBE ASSOCIATE INFERTILITY WHICH IS UNTRUE BECAUSE ACTING DOES NOT CAUSE INFERTILITY HOWEVER THE CORONA VIRUS ITSELF. IN FACT THE TEST SEASON **** INCUMBENT INFECTION IN MEN ASSOCIATE WITH LOWER SPERM COUNTS. THE SIX FOLD INCREASE IN ERECTILE DYSFUNCTION POST CODE PROBLEMS HAVE BEEN REPORTED. LONG TERM DISABILITY FROM COVE IN NINETEEN CARRY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL COST TO THE STATE SOCIETY AS WELL AS OF COURSE PERSONAL SUFFERING OF PATIENTS IN CHALLENGES FOR PARENTS AND CAREGIVERS. CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING INCREASED HEALTH CARE COSTS REDUCTION OR LOSS OF EMPLOYMENT INCREASED COSTS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION DISABILITY SUPPORT PROGRAMS. IN GREATER DEMAND FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. IS ESTIMATED AS MUCH AS 30% OF COVERT HELP BURN COULD RISE IN COVERT INDUCED DISABILITY. NOW COVERED NINETEEN HAS ONLY BEEN WITH US FOR A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS SO DEFINITIVE DATE ON THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF CO INFECTION IS STILL LIMITED. THE WHAT SCIENTISTS HAVE RAY LEARNED. INDICATES THAT THE LONG TERM BURDEN OF COPING INFECTION IS LIKELY TO BE VERY LARGE FOR BOTH FAMILIES AND SOCIETY AS A WHOLE. AFFECTING MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS. THUS WE SHOULD TAKE EVERY EFFORT TO PREVENT PEOPLE ESPECIALLY OUR CHILDREN FROM EVER BEING INFECTED OR RE INFECTED BY THIS VERY SERIOUS DISEASE. SO THIS HEARING A BREAK PLEASE BRING TOGETHER EXPERTS TO SHARE WHAT WE KNOW WE STILL HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF COVERT INFECTION IN LONG COATED. WITH THAT I WOULD NOW LIKE TO GIVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE CHAIR OF OUR OF OUR PANDEMIC RESPONSE COMMITTEE SENATOR NEWMAN TO MAKE SOME OPENING REMARKS AS WELL. SENTIMENT AND THANK YOU SENATOR PAYNE AND THANK YOU IN ADVANCE TO ALL OF THE PARTICIPANTS IN TODAY'S INFORMATION HEARING. ON LONG COVE IT. FOR THE PAST FOURTEEN MONTHS I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF SERVING AS THE CHAIR OF THE SENATE SPECIAL COMMITTEE. ON PANDEMIC EMERGENCY RESPONSE IN THAT CAPACITY I'VE BEEN GRATEFUL FOR THE PARTICIPATION SUPPORT CENTER PAN. AND OTHER COLLEAGUES AS WE GRAPPLE WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF PANDEMIC RELATED ISSUES. AS THEY HAVE ARISEN. OVER THE COURSE OF THE FIRST TWO YEARS OF THIS UNPRECEDENTED PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY THE OVERALL FOCUS. OF PUBLIC HEALTH POLICIES HAS UNDERSTANDABLY BEEN GEARED TOWARD CONTAINING THE PANDEMIC. AND ADDRESSING ITS PROFOUND AND FREQUENTLY TRAGIC IMPACTS. NOW AS THE STATE CONTINUES TO SHIFT TO THIS NEXT PHASE OF PANDEMIC MANAGEMENT. POST ONLY KRON IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE NOW START TO GET READERS ATTENTION TO UNDERSTANDING AND TREATING LONG COVE IT. IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS TO COME. AS WE WERE HERE TODAY THE SCIENTIFIC COMMUNITY'S KNOWLEDGE OF LONG COVERT IS DEFINITELY BETTER TODAY THAN IT WAS A YEAR AGO. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH MORE THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ESPECIALLY IN THE AREA OF TREATMENT. MUCH IS STILL BEING DISCOVERED ABOUT THE STARS KOBE TO VIRUSES SENATOR PAYNE IS NOTED- BUT WE DO KNOW NOW THAT THE VIRUS IS REACH CAN BE THROUGHOUT THE BODY. AND ITS IMPACT CAN BE CAN BE BOTH DEVASTATING AND CHRONIC FOR MANY PEOPLE DEALING WITH LONG COVER THEIR CENTERS CAN BE DIFFUSED AND PUZZLING. MAKING IT EVEN MORE CHALLENGING FOR THEM TO GET THE CARE THEY NEED. OFTEN THESE PATIENTS HAD NOTHING PHYSICALLY WRONG WITH THEM BEFORE THEY CONTRACTED COVERT SO LIVING WITH LONG COVE IT. IS LIFE ALTERING SOME OF THESE PATIENTS ARE WITH US TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THEY FACE DAY TO DAY. THEIR STORIES MATTER. AS DAILY CASE DEATH RATES CONTINUE TO IMPROVE I URGE ALL OF US TO BE AS ATTENTIVE AS POSSIBLE. TO THE KINDS OF RISKS AND BARRIERS THESE PATIENTS FIND THEMSELVES FACING. THERE ARE NO EASY SOLUTIONS OR ANSWERS TO LONG COVE AS YOU HERE TODAY BUT WE DO KNOW THAT THE IMPACT WILL BE FELT ACROSS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS. AND HAVE SUBSTANTIAL IMPLICATIONS FOR POLICIES IN FOR PEOPLE AFTER TODAY'S HEARING WE HOPE TO HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF HOW CALIFORNIA. CAN ENGAGE WITH THEIR MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THESE PATIENTS ARE NOT LEFT FURTHER BEHIND TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES AS WE ENTER THIS NEXT PHASE A- OF THE PAY. THANK YOU AGAIN TO ALL THE PANELISTS. FOR YOUR TIME AND EFFORTS THANK YOU MR CHAIR FOR THIS TIME TO COMMENT. AND I LOOK FOR TODAY'S CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN- DO ANY OF THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO ARE PRESENT WISH TO MAKE ANY OPENING REMARKS. C. NINE THEN WE'LL GO AHEAD AND BEGIN WITH OUR FIRST PANEL OF- ON THE OVERVIEW OF LONG COATED AND- WE'RE PLEASED TO WELCOME A DOCTOR STEVEN DEEKS PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR LONG TERM IMPACT OF INFECTION. WITH NOVEL CORONAVIRUS STUDY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO AND DR SINDHU BEHIND US PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF LOS ANGELES- WELL COME AND- PLEASE- I GUESS WE'LL START WITH DOCTOR DESE- PLEASE BEGIN YOUR PRESENTATION AND WILL ALLOW QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS AFTER THE PRESENT AFTER EACH PANEL. SO DOCTOR TAKES. THANK YOU KAREN PENCE I'M GOING TO- JUST THREE SLIDES HERE AS I AS I WALK THROUGH SOME OF THE BIG PICTURE OVERVIEW OF WHAT'S BEEN HAPPENING- OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS- AND I THINK THE STORY ABOUT HOW WE GOT HERE IS IMPORTANT AND SENATE PANEL DISCUSSES IN SOME DETAIL AS WELL. BUT WE'RE NOW TWO YEARS INTO THIS PANDEMIC. MMHM AND THE FOCUS IS CLEAR NOW SHIFTING FROM THE MANAGEMENT OF THE Q. SYNDROME TO THE SORTING OUT CHRONIC LINGERING CONSEQUENCES OF THE ORIGINAL AFFECTION. BUT IF YOU GO BACK IN TIME AND AT THE STORE I THINK IS INFORMED OF WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED IS THAT THE FIRST CASES OCCURRED. IN MARCH AND APRIL SO FOR ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO. AND THERE WAS THIS IMMEDIATE FOCUS ON DEALING WITH PEOPLE IN THE HOSPITAL FOR OBVIOUS REASONS. AT THAT TIME WE HAD ANOTHER. NUMBER OF OTHER GROUPS WERE AWARE. THAT THESE TYPES OF INFECTIONS WE MIGHT ACTUALLY RESULT IN LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES WE'VE SEEN THIS WITH OTHER VIRAL INFECTIONS WE'VE SEEN IT WITH BACTERIAL INFECTIONS LIKE LYME DISEASE- WE NEVER QUITE FULLY UNDERSTOOD WHAT HAPPENED THE PAST BUT WE HAD A VAGUE SENSE BACK IN THE DAY THAT SOMETHING MIGHT HAPPEN SO WE- PUT TOGETHER COHORT WORRY BEGAN TO ENROLL PEOPLE. WHO BASICALLY SURVIVING JUDE SETTING AND JUST STARTEDTO FOLLOW THEM FORWARD IN TIME AND THERE WERE TWO YEARS INTO THIS AND I'M I'M ACTUALLY A BIT ABOUT WHAT WE LEARNT. BUT WHAT HAPPENED NEXT AFTER THIS WAS IN IN ON THE FIRST FEW MONTHS ON SOCIAL MEDIA. THESE REPORTS JUST EXPLODED AND THEN THESE ADVOCACY GROUPS. BUT A FEW OF HIM YOU'RE GONNA HEAR FROM TODAY FORMS. EVEN THE SPRING AND THE SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY IN THESE GROUPS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY EFFECTIVE. IN GETTING THE WORD OUT THROUGH THE NATIONAL MEDIA AND ALSO THROUGH VARIOUS DIFFERENT STAKEHOLDERS PARTICULARLY GOVERNMENTS- THE UK GOVERNMENT HAS INVESTED MASSIVELY IN NOW. AS OF ABOUT A YEAR AGO THE U. S. GOVERNMENT IS NOW INVESTING ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS. INTO THE STUDY OF THIS PROBLEM LONG COAT IT. AND ITS MANAGEMENT- AND THAT'S RECOVERY MISSION OF WHICH I CAN GO INTO SOME DETAIL. SO THAT'S HOW WE GOT HERE. SO WHAT WE KNOW WE DON'T REALLY KNOW THAT MUCH. WE KNOW. WE KNOW THAT THIS IS REAL OKAY IN THE FIRST YEAR SO THERE WAS A LOT OF PUSHBACK FROM MEDICARE. WHETHER THIS WAS ACTUALLY REAL THAT NOT PEOPLE SAYING. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF ANXIETY A LOT OF STRESS A LOT OF ISSUES GOING ON IN THE BACKGROUND. DUE TO THE PANDEMIC AND THEN EVERYBODY'S HEALTH IS BEING AFFECTED- AND THAT WHAT PEOPLE ARE COMPLAINING ABOUT WAS NOT DUE TO THE VIRUS. BUT DUE TO THE PANDEMIC I DON'T THINK ANYONE BELIEVES THAT ANYMORE. PEOPLE NOW HAVE THEIR OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES FOR THE MEDICAL DATA ARE NOW BECOMING VERY STRONG. EIGHT SUBSET OF PEOPLE. AND THE NUMBER AND THE FREQUENCY IS ALL OVER THE MAP. I THINK IT'S PROBABLY IN THE FINAL BUT ANYWAY A SUBSET. OF ADULTS. WHO ACQUIRE THIS INFECTION. WILL MEET A STANDARD DEFINITION NOW LONG CODE WHAT IS THAT DEFINITION OF THE WHL BASICALLY SAYS. THAT THESE SYMPTOMS HAVE TO PROCESS THREE BALD WITHIN THE FIRST THREE MONTHS. LAST FOR A COUPLE MONTHS. HAVE NO OTHER EXPLANATION. NOT HAD BEEN PRESENT BEFORE THE START OF THE WEEK AND HAVING SOME IMPACT ON PEOPLE'S DAY TO DAY LIVING. AND THAT'S- THAT'S VAGUE BUT IT'S BASICALLY I THINK A FAIR ASSESSMENT OF WHERE WE ARE. N. SOURCE COULD BE TO SPREAD THROUGHOUT THE BODY- AND SO IT'S PERHAPS NOT TOO SURPRISING NOW THAT SOME WILL LINGER EFFECTIVELY DEALING WITH ARE QUITE SYSTEMIC. THERE ARE DIFFERENT. M. ALL THE PEOPLE STARTING THEIR SERBIAN REALIZES THERE'S THESE DIFFERENT. CLUSTERS THERE'S A DIFFERENT FLAVORS RIGHT PEOPLE HAVE A NEUROLOGIC. VERSION OF THIS WITH THE BRAIN FOG IN THE ROCK AT THE AND SO FORTH. OTHERS HAVE SUCH A SYNDROME THAT'S KIND OF SIMILAR TO CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME. WITH DISABLING FATIGUE AND ALSO THEIR FAMILIES AND SO FORTH- THERE'S A STRONG. DISTINCT CARDIO VASCULAR. FLAVOR OF THIS IN WHICH PEOPLE HAVE. HEART RATE PROBLEMS AND BLOOD PRESSURE PROBLEMS AND DEVELOP THANK YOU CARDIFF COMPLICATIONS I SENT A TANDEM MENTIONED- AND THERE'S A C. A UNIQUE SYNDROME CALLED POTS THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY WAS. PROBABLY ONE THE EASY ONE TO DIAGNOSE AGAIN IT'S A IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HAS TO DO WITH THE HEART RATE. AND THE HONEST. THESE ARE. THESE ARE DIFFERENT FLAVORS BUT THERE'S A FAIR AMOUNT OF OVERLAP. BUT THE KEY THING ABOUT. THIS THE SENTENCES THAT THEY'RE REALLY HARD TO DIAGNOSE. I'M A FEW OF THEM AND PEOPLE COME IN THE CLINIC AND DESCRIBE WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT THERE'S NO X. RAYS IS NO BLOOD TESTS THERE'S NO WAY TO OBJECTIVELY PROVE WHAT'S GOING ON AND IT'S A BIG CHALLENGE FOR CLINICIANS AND PATIENTS. WHAT'S THE REASONS AND INCLUDING TRYING TO GET PEOPLE- ALL OF FIVE FOR A DISABILITY AND SO FORTH. SO HERE THE BIG HERE THE QUESTION RIGHT AND NO ANSWERS HOW WE GOT THE FINEST WE DON'T HAVE A DEFINITIVE WAY TO DIAGNOSE THE SYNDROME WE CAN'T DEFINE IT WE CAN'T MEASURE IT WE REALLY AN'T STUDY THIS IS A BIG DEAL. WHO'S AT RISK. ALMOST ALL THE STUDIES ARE BASICALLY SHOWING THAT THE- THE MORE SICK YOU ARE DURING THE- DURING ACUTE INFECTION. THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO HAVE WON BECAUSE OF IT BUT- NEARLY PEOPLE WHO ARE MINIMALLY SYMPTOMATIC. ARE AT RISK OF DEVELOPING LOCALLY JUST A LOW RISK WOMEN SEEM TO GET MORE THAN MEN- VARIOUS DIFFERENT COMORBIDITIES INCLUDING DIABETES ARE ALSO AT HIGHER RISK. WHAT IS THE NATURAL HISTORY IT'S ALL OVER THE PLACE TO SLOWLY GET BETTER OVER TIME. BUT CERTAINLY THERE'S A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHOSE SYMPTOMS PERSIST AND HAVE SOUGHT AFTER TWO YEARS OTHER PEOPLE WAXING ME. I'M NOT NOT THAT WILL CHARACTERIZE WELL VACCINES PREVENT LONG COOK IT. THAT APPEARS TO BE LIKELY TO BE TRUE ALL THE COLOR STUDIES THAT HAVE BEEN. FOR THE DAY SUGGEST ABOUT THAT PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN VACCINATED BECOME INFECTED. CAN GET LONGER BUT BUT THE RATES ARE ABOUT 50% LEVEL. ANTIVIRAL THERAPIES DURING THE ACUTE INFECTION PREVENTS LONG BECAUSE OF IT WE HAVE NO IDEA. I SUSPECT THAT THIS WILL BE TRUE BUT WE REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY DATA. THE BIG QUESTION IS- MICRON RIGHTS IS THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE BUT GOT NO MICRON IS SO MASSIVE. WE'RE ALL REALLY WORRIED ABOUT THIS- AND AT THIS POINT TIME WE JUST HAVE NO REAL DATA TO SAY WHETHER OR NOT PEOPLE WILL HAVE THE- MICRON VERSION ARE GONNA GET A LOT OF IT. THERE ARE DEFINITELY REASONABLE TO BE OPTIMISTIC THAT IS NOT GOING TO ACTUALLY BE AS STRONG AS SOCIAL BUT AGAIN WE JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT IS THE MECHANISM. THAT'S ACTUALLY OUR AREA EXPERTISE. THERE ARE FOUR OR FIVE DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO PLAY. IT'S CERTAINLY PROBABLY GONNA BE MULTIPLE FACTORS. AND FINALLY HOW SHOULD THIS BE MATCH THERE IS A GROWING. THERAPEUTIC RESEARCH AGENDA SMALL STUDIES THAT ARE EMERGING- BUT RIGHT NOW MOST OF THE MANAGEMENT. IS REHABILITATION PHYSICAL THERAPY MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FINANCIAL SUPPORT AND SO FORTH. MY PERSONAL OPINION. THAT WHAT. PEOPLE WHO ARE DEALING WITH WELCOME BUT NOW NEED MOST. IS A- THERE IS A CLINIC WHERE THEY CAN GO TO. A HOLISTIC APPROACH. GET ACCESS TO INFORMATION IT ACCESS TO CLINICAL TRIALS GET ACCESS TO THERAPY- GET ACCESS TO HELP WITH THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT ECONOMIC ISSUES. YOU KNOW IN THESE CLINICS ARE POPPING UP. BUT I'M I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'LL HAVE THE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE THAT EMERGE OVER TIME. THAT WILL HELP. ADDRESS THIS ISSUE BECAUSE IT'S SORELY NEEDED. SO I'M GONNA STOP THERE. AND TURN IT BACK TO YOU. SENATOR OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH- DOCTOR DIXON WILL NOW MOVE ON TO DOCTOR BEHIND US- FROM CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES WELCOME. I GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M DOCTORS INTO MY HEART YES I'M ONE OF THE PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE PHYSICIANS AT CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL LOS ANGELES I'M ALSO. C. H. A. P. PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR ON THE RECORD STUDY THAT DR DEEP SUSPENSION. SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC TODAY. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC I HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN CARING FOR PATIENTS. FORMULATING EVIDENCE BASED GUIDELINES AND PARTICIPATING IN MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAMS. TO CARE FOR PATIENTS WITH COPD NINETEEN AND IT'S THE CREDIT SINCE THE START OF THE PANDEMIC AT CHLA BEING SEEN OVER ONE THOUSAND CHILDREN. WITH OVER NINETEEN AND ALL OF THESE NEARLY TWO HUNDRED HAVE NEEDED. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT OKAY I'M TWENTY TWENTY CHILDREN STARTED PRESENTING WITH A NEW SINGLE CALLED MULTISYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME IN CHILDREN R. M. I. S. C. M. I. C. IS A RARE TYPEOF IMMUNE RESPONSE TO THE STAR SCHOOL RITUAL INSPECTION. THAT UP TO SEVERAL WEEKS AFTER IT CUTE RIGHT AND THAT'S FOR SURE OUR INJECTION CHILDREN CAN PRESENT WITH AN ACUTE FEBRILE ILLNESS CARDIAC ISSUES WHICH CAN INCLUDE SEVERE CARDIAC DYSFUNCTION AS WELL AS CORONARY ABNORMALITIES AND SHOCK. MISSY CAN BE SERIOUS AND THE ONE THAT WORKS FORTUNATELY MOST CHILDREN WHO ARE DIAGNOSED WITH THIS CONDITION HAVE GOTTEN BETTER MEDICAL CARE. AS OF MARCH FIRST THE CDC HAS REPORTED SEVEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE TO SIX IN THE IN THE UNITED STATES WITH SIXTY THREE DEATHS OUR TEAM AT CHLA HAS CARED FOR ONE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX PATIENTS SO FAR. NYSE AND THIS ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN 60% OF PATIENTS IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AND TWO POINT 5% OFF THE M. I. S. T. PATIENTS THE NATIONAL. SIXTY OH FOUR PATIENTS HAVE NEEDED I SEE CAN'T AND UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE. TO WE HAVE SEEN THAT M. I. S. C. STRIPS MINORITY. COMMUNITIES DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE THAN 52% OFF A PATIENT PATIENTS HAVE BEEN LET YOU KNOW AND THIS PROBABLY REFLECTS THE FACT THAT THESE PATIENTS ARE ALSO DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY COURT NINETEEN OVERALL. DO MOST CHILDREN RECOVER FROM M. I. S. C. THE LONG TERM CONSEQUENCES ARE ON THE- WE CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE THESE CHILDREN CLOSELY AND I AM I S. IT CLINIC IST CLINIC WE STARTED GETTING MORE AND MORE CONTACTS FROM PATIENTS P. M. DIS I WANT TO KNOW SYNDROME IN CHILDREN WHICH REALLY DID NOT FIT INTO THE M. I. S. C. TRACTORS THESE CHILDREN HAD LINGERING SYMPTOMS LONG AFTER THE- INSPECTION. EVEN IF THE INITIAL INFECTION WAS WITH MY SYMPTOMS OR NO SYMPTOMS AT ALL. THIS IS AS YOU HOOKED UP TO EACH STATE THERE IS NO EFFORT TO ASTRONOMICAL BIT LONG HAUL COAL WHICH ARE SCIENTIFICALLY S. POSTER TWO BY THE- IN NINETEEN OUR CLASS. SYMPTOMS OF LONG CORD AND VERY DIVERSE AND WE LAUNCHED NEW SYMPTOMATOLOGY EVERY DAY. MORE COMMONLY SEEN SYMPTOMS IN CHILDREN IN OUR CLINICS HAVE BEEN SEVERE FATIGUE HEADACHES SHORTNESS OF BREATH. CHEST PAIN OR PALPITATIONS DIFFICULTY CONCENTRATING WHICH IS ALSO CALLED BRAIN FOG MUSCLE PAIN ENGINES AND SMELL OR TASTE MANY OF THESE CHILDREN BUT PREVIOUS TO COMPLETE BECAUSE- I'M DOING VERY. WELL IN SCHOOL. AND AFTER DEVELOPING THE SYMPTOM THERE ON TO PARTICIPATE IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES ARE. MEDIA STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE PREVALENCE OF. LONG HAUL IT IS IN CHILDREN IS BETWEEN FIVE AND 50% HOWEVER WE STILL HAVE A LOT TO LEARN ABOUT THE LOCAL CHILDREN AND LARGER LONGITUDINAL STUDIES ARE REQUIRED TO UNDERSTAND THE TRUE PREVALENCE. AND I'M HOPING THE COLOR WILL BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE THIS AND UNDERSTANDING THE TRUE PREVALENCE OF IT. I HAD ESTABLISHED A LONG RECOVERY CAN'T CLINIC AT CHLA AND THIS IS ONE OF THE VERY FEW CLINICS IN THE COUNTRY THAT OFFERS LONG COLERIDGE. ALONE COULD CARE FOR PATIENTS WE HAVE HAD SEVERAL PATIENTS AND PARENTS PRESENT TO A CLINIC IN TWO YEARS FRUSTRATED IN THEIR SEARCH FOR MEDICAL CARE FOR THEIR CHILDREN. JENNIFER THIS PATIENCE IS COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING AND NEEDS CLOSE COORDINATOR COORDINATION BETWEEN A MULTI DISCIPLINARY TEAM WHICH OUT INSTITUTION AT OUR INSTITUTION SO FAR HAS INCLUDED INFECTIOUS DISEASES CARDIOLOGY NEUROLOGY. PULMONOLOGY AND SLEEP MEDICINE BEHAVIOR HAS RE HAB AND SOCIAL WORK THE GOAL OF THERAPY IS TO HELP PATIENTS TRANSITION BACK TO BABY ACTIVITIES AS RECOVERY PROGRESS. AND THIS IS VERY INDIVIDUAL AND CAN TAKE. WEEKS AND SOME PATIENTS. MONTHS AND ON THIS. SO EVEN THOUGH WE ARE JUST WHEN BEN B. MAYBE MOVING. THE WITH REGARDS TO LONG CORBETT I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ONLY SEEN THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG SYMPTOMS OF LONG CORPORATE ARE KEEPING CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL AND THEIR PARENTS OUT OF SCHOOL. AND POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH IMPACT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND RESOURCES BOTH FOR CLINICAL CARE AND CONTINUED RESEARCH EFFORTS. TO UNDERSTAND THE PREVALENCE OF THE DISEASE MECHANISMS OF DISEASE SO THAT WE CAN DEVISE OPTIMAL TREATMENTS AND PREVENTION TECHNIQUES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OUR PRESENTERS- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY WELL I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND AGAIN REALLY APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. SO I GUESS- DR D. X- YOU TALKED ABOUT. THE IMPORTANCE OF AND ACTUALLY JUST HEARD ALSO FROM DOCTOR BEHIND US ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF- I GUESS CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE RIGHT I MEAN THIS IS THAT YOU TOLD IS A COMPLEX DISEASE IN FACT I THINK YOU'RE YOU EVEN MENTION. WE DON'T REALLY HAVE A DEFINITION A LOG OF IT BECAUSE A LOT OF VARIATION AND SO FORTH MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO THAT FIRST- WHAT. SO WHERE ARE WE ON THE PATH TO ACTUALLY BETTER DEFINING THIS DISEASE AND YELL OUT OF SUPER IN ORDER TO COLLECT UP EMAIL LOGICAL DATE AND SO FORTH WE DO NEED DEFINITIONS RIGHT I THINK YOU WERE. INVOLVED WITH- WHEN HIV FIRST ARE- CAME OUT AND SO FORTH HE SPEAKS TO WHAT WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO. ONE TWO TO BE ABLE TO DO BETTER. THE FIRM RESEARCH ON WHAT LONG COVE IT IS SO IN TERMS OF DEFINITIONS. AND THEN. THE SECOND AND THEN MAYBE ALSO HAVE DOCUMENTED THIS FOLLOW UP ON THIS. IN TERMS OF. THE SETTING UP THE INFRASTRUCTURE OF THE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE. WHICH IT TO BOTH COLLECT DATA BUT ALSO PROVIDE THE- COMPLEX CARE MEAN TO SO MANY SPECIALISTS INVOLVED AND SO FORTH- THAT'S NOT AVAILABLE I MEAN I THEY EVEN HERE IN SACRAMENTO. YOU'RE WE'RE WE'RE HAVING THE HEARING. AND I USED TO WORK AT UC DAVIS CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL. NOW THAT THERE'S A LIMITED NUMBERS OF SPECIALISTS- THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND THAT THE DETACHED OF SPECIALS ARE READY PRETTY TAXED WITH DISEASES BEFORE- AND THEN WE CAN TALK ABOUT OTHER SPECIALS FOR ADULTS AND SO FORTH- PRIOR TO. THAT BECAUSE OF IT AND NOW WE HAVE ONE AND THAT THE ISSUE LOG OF IT BUT MADE A- PRETTY EASY ONE TO START OFF BY TALKING ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF ACTUALLY. DEFINING THAT RESEARCH IS GETTING THE DEFINITIONS AND THEN- THEN MOVING TOWARD ACTUALLY GETTING PEOPLE ACCESS TO. HIGH QUALITY CARE. IN THE FACE OF. THE UNCERTAINTY RELATED TO THIS DISEASE- SO. THOSE ARE TWO VERY BIG QUESTIONS PROBABLY THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT QUESTIONS IN ACTION LINKS- SO THE FIRST QUESTION REALLY ISN'T HAVING THE FINEST- AND AGAIN WE DON'T I DON'T REALLY HAVE A GOOD ANSWER TO THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE DOING THESE DEEP DIVES PERSPECTIVES COHORTS AND THE RECOVERY INITIATIVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE HOPE IS THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY WITH MULTIPLE DIFFERENT IMAGING MULTIPLE DIFFERENT PROCEDURES ASKING MILLIONS OF DIFFERENT QUESTIONS WILL COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS CRISP AND CLEAR THAT WILL DEFINE WHAT THIS IS I'M A LITTLE BIT SKEPTICAL THAT WILL DO THAT. I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE GOING TO BASICALLY HAVE TO COUNT ON QUANTIFYING HOW PEOPLE FEEL. NOW THAT'S- THAT'S THAT'S DOABLE BUT THE ISSUE THAT WE'RE GONNA CONFRONT HERE AGAIN IS THAT. OR TO USE THAT INFORMATION TO SAY SOMEONE QUALIFIED FOR DISABILITY. YOU KNOW SO SECURITY MINISTRATION ALWAYS WANT SOME HARD FACTS EXACTLY WHY ARE THEY DISABLED- TRANSACTION PART OF THE MEETING. THAT'S HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON NEXT WEEK TODAY MEETING FOR THE SUBSEQUENT ADMINISTRATIONS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW THEY'RE GOING TO FIND THIS- CLINICALLY. AND ANOTHER BIG ISSUE ABOUT THE DEFINITION. IS THAT UNLESS WE HAVE A- FOR SELECT PRECISE WAY TO MEASURE LONG COULD GET. IT'S REALLY HARD TO GET INDUSTRY TO ENGAGE TO DEVELOP THERAPIES. RIGHT I'M NOT ON THE DOORS OF ALL THE DRUG ME SAYING YOU GUYS GOT TO GET HIM OFF WE NEED. THERE'S ALL THESE THINGS WE CAN BE DOING AND THEY SAY OKAY FINE. WE'RE COMMITTED. WHAT'S THE END POINT HOW WE GONNA BASICALLY PROVED TO THE FDA THAT ARE DRUG WORKS. AND THAT'S NOT EASY TO DO WHEN YOU HAVE THESE BIG TYPES OF SYMPTOMS RIGHT. AND UNTIL WE HAVE A PRECISE WITH THE FINEST IT'S REALLY GOING TO HARD TO GET IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO DEVELOP THE TREATMENT. WHICH TAKES ME TO THE NEXT QUESTION WHICH IS THE ISSUE OF HAVING TO CARE FOR PEOPLE NOW. SO YOU THAT YOU MENTIONED I DID I WAS A H. I. V. DOCK BACK IN THE NINETIES. IN WHICH- WE HAD A SIMILAR SITUATION RIGHT WE HAD. YOU KNOW A MILLION PEOPLE UNITED STATES WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM HIV THEY RUN THESE PRIMARY CARE CLINICS THEY DIDN'T HAVE ACCESS TO GOOD CARE AND HAVE ACCESS TO EXPERTISE. THE INFECTION WAS A- DEFECT IN ALL PARTS OF THEIR LIFE INCLUDING YOUR ABILITY TO WORK. STIGMA MENTAL HEALTH. SUBSTANCE ABUSE ALL THESE ISSUES WERE SORT OF INTERTWINED INTO A DISEASE THAT WAS MORE MEDICAL IS ALSO. A SOCIAL ECONOMIC ISSUES. AND OUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR PEOPLE WITH HIV MANY FORMER MARGINALIZED- FROM DIFFERENT UNDER REPRESENTED COMMUNITIES. OUR ABILITY TO CARE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS SEMANTICALLY APPROVAL WILL DEVELOP THE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE MANY OF THEM FUNDED BY THE GOVERNMENT- INCLUDE RYAN WHITE INITIATIVE AND I DO THINK THAT IF WE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO THAT NOW PUT TOGETHER THE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE THAT THEY CAN DEAL WITH ALL ASPECTS OF THIS ISSUE AND THAT WILL ALLOW EVERYBODY TO ATTEND INCLUDING THOSE WITHOUT INSURANCE. THAT WOULD BE A GREAT SUPPORT. THANK YOU AND GOOD LUCK ON THIS DO YOU WANT TO DRESS AS USUAL. YES I AGREE THE CHECK THE CHALLENGE REALLY LIES IN HOW WE EXPECTED TO FIND. SO IS THAT THE CDC AND THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION DEFINE IT DIFFERENTLY BUT WE DO NEED A DEFINITION TO WORK WITH THESE PATIENTS AND TO BE ABLE TO. GIVE THISDIAGNOSIS TO PATIENTS SO FAR AS A WORKING DIAGNOSIS FOR AN HOUR BUT CLEANING WE USE IT TO SAY THAT ANY CHILD WHO HAS HAD NEW RECURRING OR ONGOING SYMPTOMS FOR ME FOUR WEEKS AFTER THE FIRST INSPECTION. IF THE IF THEY WERE TO MEET THIS CRITERIA AND WE THE OTHER COULD YOU HEAR ME USE THAT IS THAT THESE SYMPTOMS SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE SYMPTOMS WERE NOT PRESENT PRIOR TO THE CALL WITH INSTRUCTIONS. BENJAMIN THIS CRITERIA WE DON'T SEE THEM IN ALONG WITH THE CLINIC AND THE OTHER QUESTION ABOUT CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE SINCE WE HAVE STARTED THIS AND JUST AS YOU MENTIONED PEDIATRIC SPECIALISTS ARE OVERSTRETCHED. IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO HAVE A WHOLE SET OF SPECIALISTS BEING ABLE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CARE WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN THIS PROCESS SO I THINK THE BETTER INFRASTRUCTURE BETTER FUNDING INTO DEVELOPING THIS S. AT CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE WILL. BE OF GREAT BENEFIT TO THE PATIENT. THANK YOU A CENTER. THANK YOU MR- I APPRECIATE THE INFORMATION THAT IS BEING PRESENTED TODAY BUT I HAVE A QUESTION IN PARTICULAR AS IT PERTAINS TO EDUCATION I KNOW THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT THE PHYSICAL SIDE EFFECTS FOR CHILDREN AND I'M JUST WONDERING IF THERE IS PLANS TO PARTNER WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS TO GATHER DATA ONE OF THE- OFTEN WHERE IT'S USED HERE IS BRAIN FOG NOT ONLY IN ADULTS BUT IN CHILDREN AS WELL. AND I'M HEARING ANECDOTAL DATA FROM- EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS SO I'M JUST WONDERING WHAT THERE'S A PLAN IN PLACE SO WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE ARE ACTUALLY IN REAL TIME GATHERING THE INFORMATION FROM TEACHERS AND INSTITUTIONS- I DON'T THINK WE CAN FIND A SOLUTION UNLESS WE HAVE THAT INFORMATION SO I WANT TO TURN IT OVER TO YOU TO SEE WHAT YOU CAN SHARE. THE COMMANDERS SOUNDS LIKE MY PHONE YOUR BILL WORK. YES I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I THINK IT'S- A REALLY IMPORTANT QUESTION. WE DON'T HAVE ANYTHING IN PLACE RIGHT NOW BUT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT SHOULD DEFINITELY BE EXPLORED. WE HAVE HAD PATIENTS AND CLINIC AND AS WE SAID BEFORE THESE CHILDREN LOOK EXTERNALLY LOOK RATHER. THERE IS NOTHING TO SAY THAT THEY SUFFER FROM THIS CHRONIC CONDITION. SO HAVING THIS PARTNERSHIP WITH EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS INCREASING AWARENESS SO THAT EDUCATORS CAN INSTITUTIONS OUT OF THERE AND CAN'T CAN MAKE THE NECESSARY. AND THIS IS. CHANGES THAT THESE CHILDREN ACQUIRE WOULD BE A GREAT HELP AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THAT WOULD BE VERY HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE AND- MAKE IT HAPPEN. THANK YOU. OTHER QUESTIONS- SO ACTUALLY A DOCTOR NEEDS A- AND ACTUALLY DOCUMENT ON THIS. I KNOW THAT IS WHAT I THINK QUESTIONS OUT THERE AND AGAIN IT'S RELATED TO THE FACT THAT WE DON'T WE DON'T HAVE A DEFINITION OF DEFINITION CONSISTENT- BUT YEAH I DID SAY MY OPENING REMARKS BECAUSE NO DIFFERENT DIFFERENT RESEARCHERS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD HAVE FOUND DIFFERENT FREQUENCIES. OF LONG COVE IN I GUESS WITHOUT DEFINITION IT'S HARD TO SAY WHAT PERCENTAGE IT ACTUALLY IS BUT CAN YOU MAYBE SHED SOME LIGHT AS TO- YOU KNOW HOW BIG HOW BIG OF A PROBLEM IS THIS- AND WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE HAVING THESE LONG TERM SYMPTOMS NEEDING THESE SORTS OF PORTS AND SO FORTH AND CERTAINLY. AS LEGISLATORS WE WANNA BE SURE WERE THAT THE STATE IS PREPARING IS IT GOING TO BE PROVIDING SERVICES IN FACT THE NEXT PANEL YOU'LL BE HEARING FROM PATIENTS AND- AND ADVOCATES ABOUT THAT WHAT WHAT FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE WHAT ARE SOME OF THE THINGS WE AS A STATE SHOULD BE ANTICIPATING GIVEN WHAT YOU'RE SEEING AND THE FREQUENCY AND HOW OFTEN. HOW MANY PATIENTS ARE BEING AFFECTED IN TERMS OF PREPARING TO SERVE- THE THESE THAT PATIENTS IN THESE FAMILIES- YOU KNOW. HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE TALKING A- YOU KNOW WE'LL POPULATE FORTY MILLION THE STATE OBVIOUSLY THAT SOME OF IT DEPENDS ON HOW. MUCH WE IF THERE'S A FUTURE VARIANT HOW MUCH WE CONTINUE LET SPREAD WE JUST GOT OFF THE OMICRON WE'VE BEEN THROUGH SO MANY DIFFERENT WAYS- BUT- HE- SO I REALIZE IT MAY BE. A LITTLE BIT THE- RECEIVE SOME GUESS WORK INVOLVED BUT YOU'RE TRYING TO CLOSE THE THINGS WE GOT TO EXPERTS WHO CAN MAYBE AT LEAST GIVE US. AT LEAST A BALLPARK RANGE OF WHAT WE SHOULD BE THINKING ABOUT THE BURDEN OF LONG COVE IT. WILL NEED TO ADD THAT THE STATE WOULD NEED TO DRESS. OKAY I'LL- I'LL I'LL GIVE MY OPINION. OKAY YES ITS OPINIONS. NINETEEN IN BASED ON THE DATA WHICH IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. AND ALSO BASED ON WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR CO WORKERS. SO I THINK. I THINK I'M THE FIRST TWO OR THREE WAYS. IS WHERE I THINK THE GREATEST BURDEN OF AMENDMENTS DISABLING DISEASE. KIRK PEOPLE ARE VACCINATED THEM WE DON'T HAVE TREATMENT WE WEREN'T MASKING THEY WERE HI VIRUS EXPOSURES. SOME OF THE SICKEST PEOPLE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH IN OUR COURTS OUR FROM THE FIRST WAVE- I MADE FROM THE SECOND WAVE. YOU KNOW ONE DELTA CAME AROUND. A LOT OF PEOPLE REQUIRING DELTA WHEN THEY WERE- VACCINATED AND DATE. I'M PRETTY SURE. THEIR RISK OF DEVELOPING LONG COVERED NO QUESTION BUT THE RATES ARE MUCH LOWER. I'M AT THE NOW AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN ON THE GROUND AND THAT'S THE BIG UNKNOWN AGAIN MY GUESS IS THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO SEE A LOT OF DISEASE ON THE GROUND BUT AGAIN WE DO NOT NOT. SO I WOULD I WOULD SAY IF YOU'RE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND TEN MILLION PEOPLE BECOME INFECTED- I WOULD PROBABLY SAY A COUPLE MILLION ARE DEFINITELY GOING TO HAVE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS. BUT DISABLING DISEASE THAT PERSIST FOR MORE THAN A YEAR. THAT'S WHAT I THINK IS IT WORTH A LOT OF THE ATTENTION IS IN TERMS OF THE MEDIA AND WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE CLINICS AND THIS BILL AND SO FORTH. THAT'S PROBABLY GONNA END UP BEING A FEW PERCENTS I'M I'M GUESSING THAT WE'RE TALKING. I GET MY MATH RIGHT YOU KNOW SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE. IF YOU HAD A THOUSAND PEOPLE AT LEAST IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. COULD END UP. WITH PROFOUND. RESIDUAL DISEASE AS HAVING A- BIG IMPACT ON THEIR DAY TO DAY LIFE. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. I CAN UNDERSTAND YOU I TAKE A SHOT AT THAT QUESTION. YEAH THAT WAS ADULTS I MEAN I MEAN I HAVE NOTHING I KNOW NOTHING ABOUT CHILDREN. A OUT OF IT WITH CHILDREN IT GETS A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED THAT I'VE I MEAN THE ADULT CALENDAR WHAT LONG CORBETT- IT HAS BEEN LONGER. WITH ME WE ARE ONLY JUST STARTING TO EXPLORE THIS DIAGNOSIS AND PEDIATRICS. SO I WOULD SAY IT THE INFORMATION IS B. GET IN PEDIATRICS EVEN MORE LACKING THAN THAT AND IT DOES. BUT WHAT I CAN WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT JUST AS DR PEAKS THAT WE ARE NOW SEEING PATIENTS WERE HAVING LONG CALL WHICH AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE FIRST RATE. OUR ONLY DATA SO THERE IS A LARGE MORE WE WILL SEE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND JUST SINCE THE THIS- CLINIC OPEN WHICH WAS PROBABLY THE LAST FOUR MONTHS WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN FORTY FIVE PATIENTS IN OUR CLINIC. WE HAVE. CALLS FROM ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. SURE AND PARENTS TO BE SEEN AND NOT. SO THERE IS REALLY A HUGE NEED. AND IN TERMS OF PERCENTAGES BECAUSE THE STUDIES HAVE LOOKED AT SYMPTOMS AT DIFFERENT TIME DURATIONS. FROM THE INITIAL INFECTION THAT'S WHY THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE SO WE REALLY NEED SOME KIND OF A LONGITUDINAL STUDY TO UNDERSTAND THAT BETTER. BUT IF I WERE TO GUESS I WOULD PUT THE NUMBER SOMEWHERE BETWEEN TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT. OF THOSE WHO GET INFECTED. HAVE LOCAL IT. NO I APPRECIATE THAT- I WOULD ALSO AND MAYBE YOU CAN DO JUST TO SORT OF FOLLOW UP TO THAT DOCTOR BEHIND US- YEAH WE'VE BEEN SINCE WE'VE ACTUALLY SEEN INCREASED RATES. OF INFECTION IN CHILDREN WITH ADULT AND- THE CRIME RATE SO FOR WHATEVER REASON THAT MORE MORE IN CHILDREN NOW- AND THEN- AND THE VACCINATION RATES- FOR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN STILL FAIRLY LOW I THINK WE'RE WE'RE LIKE. THAT 30% OF THEM 23% SO WE STILL WAYS TO GO THERE AND THEN WE CAN'T VACCINATE CHILDREN UNDER FIVE AND I DON'T NOBODY CAN TOUCH ON WHAT ABOUT THE YOUNG CHILDREN- WHETHER THAT- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THERE. AND THEN IN THE MEDIA JUST AS FOR YOUR LAST- CONCLUDING PART OF YOUR YOUR YOUR RESPONSE- NOT SO MANY PEOPLE SAID WELL BECAUSE IT'S NOT SERIOUS IT'S LIKE THE FLU AND COLD AND YOUR INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST YOU'RE SEEING THESE PATIENTS- MAYBE YOU CAN THE BALLENGER REMARKS WITH- WHAT'S YOUR OPINION OF- PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT. YEAH SO COOL. LONG HOLDING POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE SEEN. ALMOST MORE THAN 90% HAD READY MIGHT BE SYMPTOMATIC. SO THAT'S WHY I KIND OF HESITATE TO SAY THAT MOST LIKELY ON THE GROUND WILL NOT RESULT IN A LONG LINE OF LONG BECAUSE REALLY THE BIG SUBSET OF PATIENTS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR CLINIC REALLY HAD VERY MILD WINDS AND JUST AS YOU MENTIONED MANY MORE CHILDREN GOT INFECTED DURING THE ON THE GROUND. AND IT'S TO BE SEEN SO I WOULD HESITATE AND SAYING THAT WE WOULD NOT EXPECT. MORE SEVERE LOCAL WITH WITH ON THE GROUND I THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE. SO MY IN FACT DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU CANNOT HAVE SECRETLY BOTH OPERATIONS WITH NYSE. AMBITIONS WITH LONG HOLD IT HAD. MOSTLY BETTING MINE IN FICTION AND IN MANY CASES WHAT UNDERWENT ALREADY HAD EXTRACTIONS IT WAS ONLY ON QUESTIONING THAT REMEMBER ALL HOLES EXCLUSION. SO MY LEG INFECTION IS NOT EQUIVALENT TO NOT HAVING PROBLEMS. DOWN THE DOWN THE LINE. AND IT SHOULD BE READY- AWARE OF THIS. THE VACCINATION THERE IS THIS DISCUSSION THAT VACCINATION- MAY NOT BE THAT USEFUL IN CHILDREN SINCE THE ILLNESSES MIGHT. BUT I WOULD ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO THINK BEYOND THE ACUTE INFECTION. THE C. CREDIT WHICH CAN BE REALLY. A LIFE THREATENING AND SEVERE AND- LIFE CHANGING FOR CHILDREN. SO IS THE CO THE C. AS THE FLU OR A OR A- NOT NOT I THINK OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS WE HAVE WE HAVE SEEN MORE THAN ENOUGH EVIDENCE OF THAT. WE NEED TO BE REALLY CAREFUL AND PROTECT OUR CHILDREN EVERYBODY THAT CAN CAN. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU THANKS SO MUCH STUFF ON THIS THANK YOU DOCTOR DEEKS IS THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY THANKS VERY MUCH FOR YOUR PRESENTATIONS- NEXT WE'LL MOVE ONTO OUR SECOND PANEL IT'S- ON LIVING ALONG COVE IT THE PATIENT FAMILY PERSPECTIVE.

MY DAUGHTER MYSELF NEVER WANTED ME MEMBER- AND I'M VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING IT IS EMOTIONAL FOR ME TO HEAR. BECAUSE GETTING CARE FOR OUR DAUGHTER HAS BEEN NOTHING- SHORT OF.

AFTER BEING HOME AND QUITE CAN'T CALIFORNIA VERY CAREFULLY WE SENT THEM BACK TO THE UNIVERSITY OF ALABAMA WHERE THEY ATTEND COLLEGE. AND THEN WITHIN TWO WEEKS OF BEING BACK ON CAMPUS. BOTH OF OUR DAUGHTERS TESTED POSITIVE FOR KOBE- FOR THE VACCINATIONS WERE AVAILABLE. THEY WERE SICK WITH A FEVER FOR ABOUT A DAY LOST THEIR SENSE OF TASTE AND SMELL AND THEN WITHIN FIVE DAYS WE'RE BACK TOTALLY NORMAL- WE KIND OF GOT LUCKY LIKE THEY HAD WEATHERED IT. EASILY AND WE FELT VERY FORTUNATE THAT YOU KNOW. WHAT'S GONNA HAVE A LONG TERM EFFECT FOR THEM- JUST SO YOU KNOW PRIOR TO. FLOOR AND HAVING TO COPE WITH IT. NINETEEN SHE HAD NEVER EXPERIENCED ANY PSYCHIATRIC EPISODES OF DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. SHE IS ATTENDING COLLEGE ON A FULL ACADEMIC SCHOLARSHIP SHE'S EXTREMELY SOCIAL RIGHT WARM ENGAGING. BECAUSE SHE'S IN A SORORITY HAS BEEN IN LEADERSHIP POSITIONS- NO UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS- PHYSICALLY ACTIVE. AN ATHLETE VERY FAT. AND THEN ABOUT SIX WEEKS LATER- AFTER HER FIRST CALL MADE POSITIVE TEST- CAME THE SUDDEN ONSET OF EXTREME ANXIETY THAT WAS CRIPPLING- HER TWIN SISTER CALLED F. VERY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR TICKET STUDENTS HOW. THEY TREATED HER LIKE SHE WAS LIKE A COLLEGE KID BASICALLY HAVING LIKE PSYCHOSIS AND MENTAL BREAKDOWN- WITHIN A COUPLE DAYS SHE WAS ALMOST CATATONIC SHE WAS HAVING A HARD TIME SPEAKING COULDN'T ANSWER BASIC QUESTIONS. CAN ORGANIZE HER THOUGHTS SO I JUMP ON A PLANE THAT GOT OUT THERE AND PICK A NEW DOCTOR. AND SHE BASICALLY SUGGESTED THAT BECAUSE WE LIVE IN LA AND THEY HAVE MORE EXPERIENCE WITH COAL BED THAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY GET A HOME THE LEAD GUY AND A PLAIN. BATTER BACK- WENT RIGHT TO THE AMERICAN EXPERIMENT MISSION HOSPITAL IN ORANGE COUNTY AND AGAIN WE'RE TREATED LIKE WE HAD A COLLEGE KID WITH HAVING. A MENTAL HEALTH BREAKDOWN OR- PREGNANT OR HAD. DONE DRUGS. PLEADED ON PANELS THOSE ONLY TESTS THAT WERE DONE LIKE SCREENER FOR GOD MAKING SURE SHE WASN'T PREGNANT. I'M VERY HUMILIATING FOR HER- VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE. AND THEN DO A COLD READ TO MY HUSBAND WAS ALLOWED TO BE IN THERE WITH US WITH THE BANK FOR THEM TO LET ME BE THERE BECAUSE IT WAS STILL EARLY DAYS. OKAY SHE THANK GOD WE HAVE- A WONDERFUL PEDIATRICIAN WHO WE'VE KNOWN SINCE SHE WAS FOUR YEARS OLD BASKETBALL HOOP- FOLLOWED UP WITH THAT KIND OF THAT WAS ON A SUNDAY ON MONDAY MORNING AND HE HAD ADMITTED TO THE CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL OF ORANGE COUNTY SHE ENDED UP SPENDING EIGHT DAYS LATER AND I DID A WHOLE BATTERY OF TESTS AND QUICKLY REALIZED THAT SHE HAD ON THE SIDEWALK AT THE HER BRAIN HAD ACTUALLY FALLEN FOR A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO HERE IT WAS VERY NEW THEY WERE KIND OF EVEN I'M SURE EXCEPT THAT EVERY SINGLE TASK THAT THEY RAN HAD- WITH NEGATIVE WHICH IS. AWESOME SHE HAD NO UNDERLYING CONDITIONS HOWEVER COLD IT WAS STILL POSITIVE- ALMOST SEVEN WEEKS LATER. WELL SO WE WERE VERY FORTUNATE THAT IN THE HOSPITAL THEY HAD GIVEN HER SOME MEDICATION FOR ANXIETY LIKE A FAST ACTING ONE AND ALMOST TRIGGERED HER THE COMMODITY OF CATATONIC STATE AND WITHIN THIRTY MINUTES OF BEING ON THE MEDICATION SHE WAS ABLE TO EXPLAIN TO US WHAT. HOW SHE WAS FEELING HAS TRIED TO FIND A GLASS WALL HAS SHE COULDN'T COMMUNICATE. AND SHE WAS BACK TO HERSELF THOUGH. WE GOT OUR A LOT OF CARE- AND. AFTER YOU KNOW SEVERAL. DIFFERENT DOCTORS NEUROLOGISTS PSYCHIATRISTS THERAPY- WE CAN'T QUOTE AND SHE WAS DOING WELL SHE FINALLY- HAD AN ON OFF AFTER THIS PAST FALL- HE HAD BEEN QUEUING UP AND DOING GREAT- BACK TO HER KIND OF LIVELY ENERGETIC SELF I'M FULLY VACCINATED BOOSTED AND THEN ON JANUARY SECOND TWENTY TWENTY Q. SHE- THE POSITIVE AGAIN- I GUESS I SHOULD I SHOULD GO BACK AND I'LL SAY THAT IN AUGUST WE WERE CONCERNED. TO KIND OF GET A BASELINE FOR WHAT WAS HAPPENING COGNITIVELY FOR HER SO WE PAID FOR AND ARE LOGICAL EDUCATIONAL ASSESSMENT AND I WOULD BE FINE WITH THAT LEARNED HAD BEEN IDENTIFIED AS GIFTED WHEN SHE WAS YOUNG. SO WE KNEW THAT OUR I. Q. WAS SHOWING LIKE IN THE NINETY EIGHTH PERCENTILE AND THE DOG WHICH OFFER MASS TRANSIT CHILD WHAT WE DIDN'T HAVE A BASELINE FOR WHAT'S HER EXECUTIVE FUNCTIONING BUT HER TEST RESULTS CAME BACK THIS YEAR WITH. HER WORKING MEMORY WITH AN IS NOT HOW SHE WAS EVER GROWING UP POOR IN WAR- AND SO I THINK THAT WAS A BIG BECAUSE OF THE ANXIETY SHE HAD THAT. HI VISIBILITY VERSUS WHAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH COMPLETELY DIFFERENT SO SHE HAS TO LEARN HOW TO. RE LEARN HOW TO LEARN- WHICH IS NOT EASY AT TWENTY THE GOOD NEWS IS HER BRAIN IS STILL YOUNG AND SHE HAS A COUPLE MORE YEARS. TO HEAL BUT- JANUARY SECOND SHE ACTUALLY TESTED POSITIVE FOR A SECOND TIME EVEN THOUGH SHE- SAID. AGAIN SHE WAS FAIRLY THICK WE WOULDN'T EVER CATHETER EXCEPTIONS THE CLOSE CONTACT FOR SOMEONE ELSE- AND- WITHOUT SHOES OKAY AGAIN AND THEN- FRIDAY. THIS PAST WEEK.

FOR THERAPY YOGA- EVERY COGNITIVE BEHAVIOR THERAPY AND THEN WE ARE WE ARE TRYING EVERYTHING TO HELP OUR KIDS. GET HER LIFE BACK- AND- IT'S HARD BECAUSE SHE IS OVER EIGHTEEN- AND SHE FALLS AND THAT'S VERY UNUSUAL CATEGORY OF NOT QUITE BEING AN ADULT- AND NOT QUITE BEING A KID AND- SHE WE HAVE STRUGGLED TO GET HER HELP- THAT IS MEANINGFUL AND IT IS ALSO VERY. CHALLENGING TO EXPLAIN TO PEOPLE THAT THIS IS ACTUALLY A REAL- AND THAT. AND I'M I MEAN. YOU KNOW WE LIVE IN CALIFORNIA BUT HAVING THE EXPERIENCE NOW DAMAGE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A TOOTH THAT DOCTORS RIGHT YES BUT DOCTORS WHERE SHE'S LIVING THERE. THEY JUST AREN'T EVEN INFORMED ON THAT AT ALL SO THE FACT THAT YOU ARE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE AND- I MEAN THAT MAKES ME VERY HOPEFUL FOR THE FAMILIES THAT ARE LIVING WITH THIS BECAUSE- IT'S A IT'S A NIGHTMARE AND SO- PROFESSIONAL DIAGNOSIS NOW WHO'S BEEN BOTH COPING I LOGICAL THINKER- BUT- I MEAN.

GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH HI MY NAME IS ANGELA MEDICARE OSCARS AND TODAY I'M HERE TO SPEAK OF A DISABLED FORMER ATHLETE. MONACO WITH PATIENT AND PRESIDENT OF BALI BODY POLITIC THE GRASSROOTS PEACE OF MIND ORGANIZATION AT THE FOREFRONT. OF LONG COAT WITH ADVOCACY FUELED BY OUR SUPPORT GROUP OF OVER TEN THOUSAND PATIENTS WORLDWIDE. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND STAFF FOR INVITING ME TODAY. BEFORE GETTING HOGAN NINETEEN HERE IN LOS ANGELES ON MARCH TWENTY TWENTY HOURS A RUNNER FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES. IN FACT THE MORNING OF THE DAY I FIRST STARTED FEELING SICK I HAD GONE FOR A GREAT THREE MILE RUN. IT'S BEEN NEARLY TWO YEARS OF CODE NINETEEN SOMETIMES AND I HAVE. THAT I'M NOT SURE WHEN I'LL BE ABLE TO. EXPERIENCE AN INCREASINGLY SCARY SET UPS AND DOWNS INCLUDING SEVERE LEVELS OF BLOOD CLOCKS A SERIES OF MINI STROKES. BRAIN SWELLING SEIZURES PAINFUL HEART PALPITATIONS SEVERE SHORTNESS OF BREATH. EXTREME CONFUSION AND NUMBNESS IN MY FACE HANDS AND LEGS THAT PROGRESSED TO AN INABILITY TO WALK FOR SEVERAL DAYS. AND AT MOMENTS UNABLE TO SPEAK- I ALSO DEVELOPED NEW ONSET ANAPHYLAXIS AFTER EVERY MEAL- AND JUST HEARING STEPHANIE I DESCRIBED HER DAUGHTER'S EXPERIENCES YOU ARE- DIRECTLY. ARE SIMILAR TO MY TO REALLY GET. COMPETENT COMPASSIONATE CARE ESPECIALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC- FROM ANY OF THE MAJOR HOSPITALS IN LOS ANGELES- IT WAS QUITE A TERRIFYING TIME AND I SURVIVED. ALL OF THOSE- SYMPTOMS INCLUDING THE MINI STROKES FROM MY BED- I pSEVERAL ONGOING CHRONIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING LIKELY A MILD FORM OF MYALGIC AND STUFF ON MY LATEST M. EAT. ALSO KNOWN AS CHRONIC FATIGUE SYNDROME OR ME CFS AT THE NARROW IMMUNE CONDITION WHOSE HALLMARK SYMPTOM IS POST EXERTIONAL SYMPTOM EXACERBATION WHICH MEANS WHEN I PUSH MYSELF PAST A DYNAMIC THRESHOLDS. I WILL EXPERIENCE A RELAPSE OF MY WORST SYMPTOMS LIKE INSOMNIA BRAIN FOG AND CONFUSION SLEEP APNEA HEART PALPITATIONS. AND SEVERE MIGRAINES I HAVE DEVELOPED A STRICT HASTING REGIMEN THAT ALLOWS ME TO WORK FROM HOME. MORE THAN FULL TIME REALLY- BUT I DON'T DO MUCH ELSE I DON'T SOCIALIZE I DON'T ENJOY MY OLD HOBBIES. AND I DON'T EVEN LEAVE MY HOME ESPECIALLY NOW THAT I'M CONSIDERED HIGH RISK. FOR COMPLICATIONS FOR A SUBSEQUENT REGULAR INSPECTION AS YOU DO HEARD- ON MY ME AT LEAST HALF TO KNOW IT THIRDS OF SURVEY UNCOVERED COULD NOT WORK FULL TIME THE VAST MAJORITY OF PATIENTS EXPERIENCE DEEP PETITE ALONG WITH NEUROLOGICAL AND COGNITIVE SYMPTOMS THAT MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DRIVE MAKE DECISIONS REMEMBER INSTRUCTIONS FOLLOW CONVERSATIONS AND PLAN AHEAD. THE BOOKING AND BROOKINGS INSTITUTE RECENTLY ESTIMATED THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION WORKERS ARE OUT OF THE WORK FORCE DUE TO LONG COALBED WHICH REPRESENTS AN ASTOUNDINGMAJORITY OF THE ESTIMATED TWO POINT TWO MILLION PEOPLE BUT THE LABOR FORCE IS MISSING FROM ITS PRE PANDEMIC SIZED. EVEN BEFORE KOBE TO ME CFS WHICH IS EXTREMELY DEBILITATING AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT OVERLAP WITH ONE KOBE AFFECTED ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND OUR CAR AND COST OUR ECONOMY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN LOST WAGES AND MEDICAL EXPENSES THERE ARE ONLY ABOUT SIX AND THE CFS SPECIALISTS PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA WHICH MEANS THAT CALIFORNIANS LIKE ME. AFFLICTED WITH ME CFS OFTEN WAIT UP TO TWO YEARS BEFORE BEING EXAMINED BY A SPECIALIST MANY NEVER GET TO SEE ONE AT ALL AND THIS TREND IS NOW ABSOLUTELY OCCURRING WITH ONE KOBE. I'M IN THE MILD END OF THE SPECTRUM OF DISABILITY HAVE LONG pCOOPERATED I HAVE BEEN PART OF SUPPORT GROUPS LISTENING SESSIONS AND NEWS REPORTS OF PATIENTS WERE UNABLE TO WORK AT ALL WHO ARE HOMEBOUND LIKE ME OR EVEN BED BOUND. UNABLE TO CARE FOR THEMSELVES BECAUSE THE ACT OF MAKING A MEAL LEAVES THEM WITH FEVERS AND PAIN SO SEVERE THEY ARE COMPLETELY TAKEN OUT FOR THE REST OF THE DAY THESE PATIENTS HAVE FAMILIES THAT ARE OFTEN PARENTS AND BREADWINNERS THEIR ACCESS TO BENEFITS IS NONEXISTENT BECAUSE LONG COVE IT WAS NOT EVEN A DIAGNOSABLE CONDITION UNTIL OCTOBER NEARLY TWO YEARS INTO THE PANDEMIC DESPITE THE MEDICAL RESEARCH ON POST VIRAL CONDITIONS LIKE ME CFS CHRONIC LYME AND EVEN AIDS. HAS EXISTED TO GUIDE CLINICIANS IN CARING FOR PATIENTS. WITH INFECTION TRIGGERED THE QUALITY. WE MUST BUILD ON THE SUCCESS RESEARCH AND NOT TO FRAME LONG IT AS AN ENTIRE NEW PHENOMENON. MY FRIEND AND COLLEAGUE HANNAH DAVIS FROM THE PATIENT LED RESEARCH RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE- WHO ARE STUDYING LONG COVE IT HAS STARTED ALL OF MY TESTS CAME UP NORMAL UNTIL I WENT TO AN EMMY CFS DR. AND THEN NONE OF MY LABS WERE NORMAL. THAT'S TRUE FOR ME AS WELL I WAITED A YEAR TO SEE A SPECIALIST WHO CAN DIAGNOSE AND TREAT MY CONDITION NAMELY MAST CELL ACTIVATION SYNDROME. AND SHE HAS WORKED WITH PATIENTS WITH POST VIRAL ILLNESS SUCH AS M. CAST IN MECS FAST FOR YEARS AND HAVE TO WAIT LIST A MILE LONG. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE VIRUS HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR BOTH ECONOMICALLY AND IN TERMS OF THEIR HOUSE. THIS MEANS THAT THERE ARE LIKE MILLIONS OF LONG COVE IN PATIENTS WHO BEAT HER BECAUSE OF INCOME OR IMMIGRATION STATUS. REMAIN UNIDENTIFIED OR UNSUPPORTED WITH THEIR NEW JUST ABILITIES BY THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. EMPLOYERS AND SCHOOLS. I ALSO DID WANT TO NOTE THAT FAST ESTIMATES SHOW THAT IT ABOUT 30% OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE HAD COPA NINETY REPORTED AT LEAST ONE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS. UP TO SIX MONTHS AFTER INFECTION. THAT MEANS A CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S TWO POINT SIX MILLION SURVIVING COPD PATIENTS IN CALIFORNIA. TWO POINT SIX MILLION PATIENTS ARE EXPERIENCING SYMPTOMS OF LONG COLD BED- IT WHICH ARE VARIED AND OBVIOUSLY ARE DIFFICULT TO TREAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE A HISTORY OF TREATING PERSISTENT. INFECTIOUS CHRONIC ILLNESS SO TOGETHER WITH THE DISABILITY AND CHRONIC ILLNESS COMMUNITIES LONG COVERED PATIENTS NEED CALIFORNIA TO DO THE FOLLOWING. THE FIRST IS TO ADDRESS THE CLINICAL CARE CRISIS AND LONG COAL BED AND RELATED POSTS VIRAL ILLNESSES LIKE ME CFS. CALIFORNIA'S CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE MUST BE CREATED. THE CENTER SHOULD BE LOCATED THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND SHOULD PROVIDE ADEQUATE CARE CONDUCT RESEARCH AND ENGAGE IN EDUCATION TRAINING AND OUTREACH. TO POLICIES THAT ENSURE THAT ALL PATIENTS WITH COMPLEX CHRONIC ILLNESS. HAVE ACCESS TO THE BEST POSSIBLE PRIMARY AND SPECIALIST CARE FULLY COVERED BY PRIVATE INSURANCE AND MEDICAL. AND IN THE CASE OF COVER NINETEEN REGARDLESS OF HAVING A POSITIVE TEST. DUE TO TESTING ISSUES THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY IN POOR BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES. THREE ENSURE THAT LONG COVERED PATIENTS ARE ABLE TO ACCESS STATE DISABILITY INSURANCE BENEFITS. EVEN IF THEY DO NOT HAVE A POSITIVE TEST GIVEN THE PERSISTENT TESTING ISSUES. FOR REQUIRE COMMERCIAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH PLANS WITH GUIDANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN CAL AG JUST. TO CONDUCT EXTENSIVE OUTREACH AND EDUCATION TO PROVIDERS AND BENEFICIARIES ABOUT THE SYMPTOMS. OF LONG PROBATE AND GUIDE IT'S ON HOW TO ACCESS. FIVE CREATE AN FOR PROVIDERS AND MEDICAL STUDENTS INCLUDING MEDIC HELP PROVIDERS TO RECEIVE ONGOING CLINICAL EDUCATION ON COMPLEX CRACKED AND CHRONIC INFECTION. INFECTION INITIATED ON THAT SAYS AND FINALLY AT SIX STRONGER ENFORCEMENT OF EMPLOYER IN SCHOOL ACCOMMODATIONS FOR LONG CARPET AND OTHER CHRONIC CHRONICALLY ILL PATIENTS WHO MAY BE ABLE TO WORK OR GO TO SCHOOL IF THEY HAVE ACCESS TO TELEWORK OR DISTANCE LEARNING. CAN HAVE ADOPTED SCHEDULES ARE PROVIDED WITH REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS INCLUDING MASKING REQUIREMENTS FOR THEIR COLLEAGUES WITH WHOM THEY SHARE INDOOR SPACE. AND HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RESTRUCTURE THEIR ASSIGNMENTS OR JOBS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU THANK YOU THIS FAST WITH THIS- AND- AGAIN THANK YOU ALSO FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY AS WELL- WITH ALL OF US AND YEAH I KNOW HOW CHALLENGING THAT IS IN THIS PUBLIC FORUM TO SHARE SOMETHING SO PERSONAL AS WELL. LET'S NOW MOVE ON TO JENNIFER STARK- PATIENT IN MANAGING ATTORNEY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE- COMMITTEE FOR INVITING ME TO SPEAK TODAY. MY NAME IS JENNIFER STARK AND I'M THE MANAGING ATTORNEY OF THE MENTAL HEALTH PRACTICE GROUP AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. I'M HERE TO SPEAK ABOUT MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCES WITH LONG COVETED. AND IMPORTANCE OF AFFORDING DISABILITY ACCOMMODATIONS AND PROTECTIONS. FOR THOSE WHO ARE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY IT. ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO TO THE DAY I BECAME SICK. AT THE TIME I WAS ON PARENTAL LEAVE AND BARELY LEAVING THE HOUSE BECAUSE I NEEDED TO CARE FOR MY FOUR MONTH OLD DAUGHTER AND I WAS ALREADY CONCERNED ABOUT THE VIRUS. HOW THE STATE'S LOCKDOWN ORDERED GONNA JUMP BACK JUST ONE WEEK PRIOR. I LIKELY WOULD HAVE BEEN SPARED THE VIRUS AND THE CONTINUING TOLL IT TAKES. I WAS SICK FOR APPROXIMATELY THREE WEEKS. WELL ALL MY SYMPTOMS TRACKED THOSE OF KOBE AND I NEVER RECEIVED A POSITIVE TESTS-BECAUSE TESTS WERE NOT AVAILABLE FOR PEOPLE LIKE ME. REALLY LEAVE THE BED BUT I DID NOT REQUIRE HOSPITALIZATION. IN THE WEEKS AFTER HAVING COME IN I FEEL EXTRAORDINARILY GRATEFUL FOR HAVING RECOVERED AND MOVED BEYOND- SUCH A FRIGHTENING EXPERIENCE. BUT APPROXIMATELY TWO AND A HALF MONTHS LATER I DEVELOPED BREATHING PROBLEMS AGAIN. I WONDER DO YOU KNOW WHETHER I MIGHT HAVE CALLED IT A SECOND TIME. PROSPECT IT SEEMS NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE BECAUSE I HADN'T LEFT THE HOUSE. I WENT IN I GOT TESTED FOR KOBE AND FOR CODY ANTIBODIES AND BOTH CAME BACK NEGATIVE. DOCTORS HAD NO EXPLANATION FOR ME. I'M SEVERAL IT I WAS BASICALLY TOLD JUST TO TAKE AN ANTACID- SEVERAL WELL MEANING FRIENDS AND FAMILY EXPRESSED DISBELIEF THAT I AND EVERYONE HAD KOBE OR ANYTHING RELATED TO IT. THEY WONDERED WHETHER THE EXTREME FATIGUE THAT I WAS EXPERIENCING WHICH IS AKIN TO HAVING MONO WAS SIMPLY DUE TO HAVING A NEW CAR. THE QUESTION THE SERIOUSNESS OF MY SYMPTOMS RECURRING LOW GRADE FEVERS SHORT TERM MEMORY LOSS BRAIN FOG. DIFFICULTY BREATHING RACING HEART BEAT DIGESTIVE PROBLEMS ANXIETY DEPRESSION. ACCORDING TO THEM BECAUSE I WAS MANAGING TO KEEP WORKING AS A LITIGATOR AND I DIDN'T NEED TO AND I DIDN'T COMPLAIN VERY OFTEN. I SEEMED FINE. THEY SOON I WAS MERELY EXAGGERATING OR BEING A HYPOCHONDRIAC. WHEN I WENT TO A DOCTOR TO EXPRESS CONCERN TO MY SCHOOL AND I IN SCHOOL AND HOSTED IN TURN RUFFLED PURPLE AND MADE IT DIFFICULT TO WALK. THEY ME THAT I SHOULD JUST STOP WEARING FLIP FLOPS. THIS IS THE BEGINNING OF WEEKS MONTHS AND NOW YEARS OF- PEOPLE JUST BELIEVING ME AND MY EXPERIENCE HAS. SIMPLY BECAUSE SCIENCE HAS NOT CAUGHT UP TO THE LIVED EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE WITH LONG HAVE HAD RECURRING WAVES OF SYMPTOMS THAT WE NOW RECOGNIZE EMBLEMATIC OF LONG IT. IS WIDE RANGING SYMPTOMS OF AFFECTED ME FROM HEAD TO TOE I SPENT MONTHS TRYING TO GET A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENTS AND MEETINGS WITH SPECIALISTS. IN WHAT FEELS LIKE A GAME OF WHACK A MOLE. AFTER WAITING FOR MORE THAN THREE TO FOUR MONTHS TO SEE A NEUROLOGIST MY SYMPTOMS MOVE TOO MUCH FROM MY BRAIN TO MY LUNGS. BY THE TIME I GOT TO MEET WITH THE PULMONOLOGIST MY SYMPTOMS HAD MOVED TO MY JOINTS AND SO ON. I REQUEST YOU REFERRALS TO SEE THE LONG HOPING UNITED UCSF. BUT INITIALLY DIDN'T QUALIFY BECAUSE I WAS NEVER HOSPITALIZED. I'M NOT ON THE LIST FOR AN APPOINTMENT WITH YOUR SCHEDULE MORE THAN NINE MONTHS AGO AND UCSF HAS ALREADY CANCELLED. ONCE I'M STILL WAITING. I'VE BEEN LIVING WITH LONG COVERED FOR ALMOST TWO YEARS NOW AND HAVE YET TO BEAT ME WITH ANY MULTI DISCIPLINARY DOCTORS WHO CAN HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND. IN FACT THE LONG CALL BUT IS HAVING ON MY BODY. AND WHAT IF ANYTHING I CAN DO TO TREAT IT. THE IMPACT OF HAVING LONGER BUT IT'S HAD ON ME MENTALLY AND PHYSICALLY IT'S HARD TO QUANTIFY. BUT I FEEL COMPARATIVELY LUCKY MANY PEOPLE WITH LONG KOBE HAVE HAD FAR MORE DEVELOPED DEBILITATING DEBILITATING EXPERIENCES. AND I'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO WORK. AT ALL. THIS HAS TAKEN IT. ON MY- AND I. TO TAKE FARM SICK THAN EVER. YOU KNOW THINK. AND I CHANGING. AND DOCTORS AND- I'VE OPTED OUT OF CERTAIN CAREER OPPORTUNITY. I'M CONCERNED THAT THAT SYMPTOMS MIGHT RETURN. AND I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO PERFORM THE TASKS NECESSARY. DESPITE THE SETBACKS I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO KEEP WORKING BECAUSE I HAVE A JOB THAT OFFERS FLEXIBILITY MAKES REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. IF I WERE IN A DIFFERENT WORKPLACE REFUSE TO OFFER THESE ACCOMMODATIONS I MAY HAVE NEEDED TO QUIT SEVERAL MONTHS AGO. THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST DISABLING ADVANCE IN UNITED STATES HISTORY IMPACT THE CODE NINETEEN HAS HAD ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ESPECIALLY THE BLACK LIKE NEXT IN AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES. MAKES THE NEED TO RESPOND TO THIS DISABLING EVENT IN A WAY THAT'S SQUARELY ADDRESSES SOCIO ECONOMIC INEQUALITY ABSOLUTELY VITAL. BASED ON MY OWN EXPERIENCES IN THE WORK I'VE DONE A DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA FOR MANY STATES THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA MUST HATE TO ADDRESS THIS CRISIS. WE'VE ALREADY FEEL HEARD A FEW OF THOSE AND I JUST WANNA ECHO SUPPORT. I'M BUILDING ON WHAT SEVERAL OTHER PANELISTS AMARI SAID. FIRST THERE NEEDS TO BE CLEAR RECOGNITION THAT LONG CODE CAN BE DEEMED A DISABILITY UNDER THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT. WHICH TRIGGERS THE NEED TO PROVIDE ACCOMMODATIONS. DESPITE THE OFTEN INVISIBLE NATURE OF THIS CONDITION IT MUST BE CLEAR TO BUSINESSES SCHOOLS AND EMPLOYERS. THE PEOPLE WHOSE LONG COVERED QUALIFIES AS A DISABILITY MUST BE AFFORDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS FROM DISCRIMINATION. THE REASON ACCOMMODATIONS AS ANY OTHER PERSON WITH A DISABILITY UNDER THE ADA AND REHABILITATION. THERE ALSO NEEDS TO BE FAR MORE RESEARCH ON LONG PROBATE THIS IS A BIG FOCUS ON UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND UNDERLYING HEALTH CONDITIONS. AND AS WE'VE ALREADY HEARD THERE IS A NEED FOR EXPANDED TREATMENT OPTIONS INCLUDE MULTI DISCIPLINARY TREATMENT TEAMS ACCESS CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE. BUT A REDUCTION OF UNNECESSARY BARRIERS TO TREATMENT AND REIMBURSEMENT SUCH AS ELIMINATING THE NEED FOR HOSPITALIZATION OR PROOF OF THE POSITIVE CONTEST. AND THERE HAS TO BE CONTINUOUS FEEDBACK LOOP WITH LEADING REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PATIENT COMMUNITIES INFORMING RESEARCH AND POLICY DECISIONS. HOW MANY OF TE PROBLEMS THAT PEOPLE WITH LONG KOBE AND ARE EXPERIENCING ARE NOT NEW TO THE DISABILITY COMMUNITY. THIS IS A NEWLY POLITICAL PROBLEM GIVEN HOW MANY MORE PEOPLE ARE NOW GOING TO BE IMPACTED. FOR ME THE SCARIEST PART OF ALL OF THIS IS THAT WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE FUTURE HOLDS. WHILE I AM THANKFULLY ONLY EXPERIENCING WHAT SEEMED TO BE MINOR LONG COVERED SOMETHING RIGHT NOW. I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT TOMORROW NEXT MONTH OR NEXT YEAR MIGHT BRING. WHETHER LONG COVERED WILL BECOME A LIFELONG CHRONIC CONDITION FOR ME EARLY TO EARLY MORTALITY. WHETHER MY TIME WITH MY TWO YOUNG CHILDREN WILL BE CUT SHORT OR MY ABILITY TO BUILD A MEANINGFUL CAREER WE HOLD. NO ONE KNOWS. I HOPE THAT OTERS DON'T HAVE TO CONTINUE TO NAVIGATE THESE TERRIFYING QUESTIONS IN A WAY THAT I HAVE LARGELY ALONE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR ARCA AND THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY AS WELL AND- YEAH AND- END OF IT SAID IT. IT'S ALWAYS CHALLENGING TO DO IN THE PUBLIC ENVIRONMENT TO SHARE YOUR PERSONAL STORIES. AND I WANNA THANK ALL OUR PANELISTS- FOR BEING HERE AND FOR SHARING WITH US SO THAT- WE- THERE'S A LEGISLATURE CAN. I TRY TO- HOPEFULLY MAKE PROGRESS AND- AND ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT YOU'VE RAISED- I'M NOT SURE WHO HAD A MICROPHONE UP FIRST BUT OKAY SIR LATER. THANK YOU SENATOR PAM I JUST WANT TO REITERATE MY THANKS TO THESE THREE AMAZING WOMEN WHO SHARED THEIR STORIES ALL AT DIFFERENT POINTS IN THEIR LIFE. AND I JUST HOPE AS HARD AS IT MAY BE THAT THEY WILL KEEP SHARING THEIR STORIES. BECAUSE I'VE HEARD OF LONG COVERT BUT HEARING THE ACTUAL DETAILS AND HOW DISRUPTIVE IT IS TO THEIR LIVES WE ALL NEED TO HEAR THAT SO THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S REAL. THAT IS HAPPENING AND THAT WE HAVE TO FIND A WAY TO TACKLE IT. I DON'T REMEMBER WHICH OF THE THREE WOMEN STATED THAT ONE POINT SIX MILLION. PEOPLE ARE OUT OF WORK RIGHT NOW DUE TO LONG COVE IT. I THINK THAT WAS SHOCKING TO ME AND IT- THAT PROBABLY HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHY THERE'S SUCH A SHORTAGE OF WORKERS RIGHT NOW. WHEN WE ADD THAT TO THE ALMOST ONE. MILLION PEOPLE WHO HAVE DIED DUE TO A COVERED- IT'S NO WONDER THAT WE'RE HAVING A HARD TIME GETTING THE WORK FORCE- BACK UP AND RUNNING SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO THESE THREE BRAVE WOMEN. BECAUSE IF WE DON'T KNOW BETTER WE CAN'T DO BETTER THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU SIR LIVER CENTER RUBIO. THANK YOU MR PRESIDENT I ALSO WANT TO THANK THESE WONDERFUL INDIVIDUALS FOR SHARING THEIR STORY I KNOW IT'S NOT EASY BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THEY DO. YOU KNOW WHAT. REALLY SET OUT TO ME AS I BELIEVE THAT- SOME OF THE- THE TWO LADIES I SPOKE FIRST SAID THAT THEY HAD ALREADY BEEN BOOSTED AND THEN THEY GOT COLD FEET AGAIN AND I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT SINCE THERE'S SO MUCH MISINFORMATION I HEAR IT CONSTANTLY. FROM OUR YOUTH AND ADULTS SAYING THAT THEY WANT TO GET COVERAGE IS TO GET IT OVER WITH AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IT'S NOT JUST GETTING CALL OF IT. BUT IT'S ALSO DEALING WITH THESE LONG TERM EFFECTS AND THE FACT THAT THEY WERE GOT IT. AFTERTHEY WERE ALREADY SICK I JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT POINT THAT. IT'S CLEAR THAT YOU DON'T KNOW IF IT'S GOING TO COME BACK AGAIN. I HEARD EARLIER TODAY AGAIN SOMEONE WANTS TO GET COVERAGES BECAUSE THEY WILL NOT GET IT AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR STORIES I THINK THAT THAT PUTS. THAT PUTS IT IN PERSPECTIVE AND I THINK THAT LEARNING FROM YOUR STORIES WE NOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO AND- WILL DO WHAT WE CAN TO CONTINUE THE RESEARCH AND TRY TO. FIGURE OUT SOLUTIONS BUT ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SENATOR RUBIO CENTER WINNER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I ALSO JUST WANT TO THANK- PEOPLE TODAY BUT ALSO IN IN GENERAL OF THE LONG HAULERS- WHO HAVE BEEN- SUFFERING ARE OFTEN THE LAST TWO YEARS- AND WHO HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING AND SOMETIMES I KNOW IT FEELS LIKE THEY'RE YELLING INTO. THE VOID- ESPECIALLY FOR PEOPLE WHO- KAKU VERY EARLY- IN SPRING SUMMER TWENTY TWENTY- WHEN WE KNEW ALMOST NOT ME SO LITTLE ABOUT THIS VIRUS IN GENERAL AND WE WERE IN A FIRE DRILL EMERGENCY TRIAGE MODE- TO YOU KNOW STOP PEOPLE FROM. DYING TO STOP TO STOP THERE. IN OTHER LUNGS FROM DISSOLVING EFFECTIVELY- AND WE WERE NOT AS A SOCIETY REALLY PAYING- ENOUGH ATTENTION THE PEOPLE WHO HAD RECOVERED AND- IN QUOTES FOR COVERED UP OR NOT REALLY RECOVERED- AND WE'RE EXPERIENCING THESE LONG TERM. EFFECTS AND I KNOW IT'S IT WAS SO FRUSTRATING FOR SO MANY MONTHS STILL AS IN TERMS OF. GETTING THREE MEN AND SOMETIMES GETTING THE- HEALTHCARE SYSTEM TO TAKE THEM SERIOUSLY. AND WE KNOW THAT EVEN BEFORE COVERT FOR PEOPLE WITH POST VIRAL- SYMPTOMS WHETHER FROM A MONO OR OR FROM OTHER- VIRUSES THEY WERE NOT TAKEN- SERIOUSLY CONSISTENTLY AND PEOPLE WERE TOLD THAT THEY WERE SUPPOSED- HAD A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE OR THEY WERE JUST- OVERLY SENSITIVE OR THEY WERE MAKING IT UP- AND- AND I THINK- ONE OF THE THERE'S NOTHING GOOD ABOUT COVERT BUT AT LEAST COVE IT HAS. SHINED A BRIGHT LIGHT ON- POST FILES- PROBLEMS ARE NOT JUST FOR COVERED BUT FOR OTHER VIRUSES AND I REALLY HOPE. THIS LEADS TO DRAMATIC INVESTMENT AND RESEARCH ODDS FIGURE OUT. HOW WE PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING WHEN SOMEONE HAS A VIRAL INFECTION AND HOW WE TREAT OUR PEOPLE AFTER THE FACT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY- AND PLEASE KEEP ADVOCATING. AND HOLD ALL OF US ACCOUNTABLE. THE OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS I DID HAVE A QUESTION I WANTED TO BECAUSE- ANSWER CAME FROM THE FIRST PANEL AND- MAYBE WELL DO IS I'LL START WITH THAT FIRST WITH THEM THE STARK BECAUSE YOU ALSO HAVE YOUR HAT ON AS WEARING- DISABILITY RIGHTS AND- I DO SEE. THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I SEE- CITY GREETERS HAND UP SO DID YOU WANT TO DO I RESPOND TO ONE OF THE SENATORS WHO JUST SPOKE. AT SO MAYBE I'LL LET YOU GO FIRST AND THEN I'LL POST MY QUESTION HOW IS THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH- I GUESS I THINK- I APPRECIATE INPUT FROM BOTH OF THE OTHER. WOMEN WHO SPOKE ON THEIR- ON THEIR JOURNEY WITH US. I JUST THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT ONE I THINK THAT WAS BROUGHT UP THAT NEVER OCCURRED ME AND MY EDUCATIONAL HAT AND MY PARENTS HAD THE SAME TIME. IT CAN BE DONE PROBABLY VERY QUICKLY IS TO IDENTIFY WHAT WE CAN DO IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM TO HELP THESE KIDS- ONLY BECAUSE I'M AN EDUCATOR AND I KNEW. THAT WE COULD GO TO THE OPERA DISABILITY. THROUGH MY DAUGHTER TO THE UNIVERSITY TO GET HER EXTENDED TIME. EXCUSED ABSENCES BECAUSE SOME PROFESSOR STILL. LIKE STILL YOU. KNOW HE MISSED THREE CLASSES YOUR GREAT GOT. I WHEN IT. TO A DIFFERENT. BUT I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE AT ONE POINT WE WERE TOLD BY THE UNIVERSITY COAL BED- WILL NO LONGER BE AN EXCUSE. MMHM AND THAT WAS VERY STARTLING BECAUSE SO THEN WE ACTUALLY HAD A OKAY SHE HAS ANXIETY. SO THAT WAS IT I DON'T THINK BUT COMFORTABLE WITH GIVE HER ACCOMMODATION BUT THEY DID NOT WANT YOU CALL THAT AS A- AS A WAY FOR HER TO GET. ACCOMMODATION THAT SHE ABSOLUTELY NEEDED TO HAVE AND- YOU KNOW AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE I KNOW THAT WE CAN BE AFFECTION BIBLE PORTION THAT MAYBE SOMETHING THAT PARENTS DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT'S AVAILABLE TO THEM- I SPEAKING FAST MAY NOT KNOW THAT THOSE ACCOMMODATIONS. ARE GOING TO BE NECESSARY FOR SOME OF THE KIDS- WHO ARE GOING TO BE TRAVELING WITH THEM I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO GET THAT IDENTIFIED BY. MY POSITION THAT. THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH AND ACTUALLY THAT WAS KIND OF REFERRED TO THE QUESTION ABOUT THE PROS WHICH ACTUALLY INVOLVE ME ABOUT THESE I'M GONNA START OFF WITH- THE STARK- AND- PARTIALLY BECAUSE ALSO YOU YOU HAVE YOUR HATS ON AS A- AS- A AS A- BEING AN ATTORNEY AT DISABILITY RIGHTS- AND- THEN THEY GO OUT AND THEN WE'LL HAVE THIS VAST QUIZ AND ACTUALLY MYSTERIES IF YOU WISH TO. COMMENT ON IT AFTER HEARING THE OTHER ANSWERS. SO THIS WHOLE ISSUE ABOUT WHO QUALIFIES FOR SERVICES RIGHT NOW- IT ENDED YOU MENTIONED- SIR HE TALKED ABOUT THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW YOU YOU YOU GOT TOLD EARLY ON SO THERE WAS NO TESTING AVAILABLE ARE VERY LIMITED TESTING AND I REMEMBER WHEN HE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TESTS. AND SOMETIMES EVEN NOW SOMETIMES IT'S A BIT OF A CHALLENGE TO- SO WHAT DO YOU SEE FROM FROM. THE POLICY POINT OF VIEW FROM. OUR PERSPECTIVE IS AS LEGISLATORS WE SHOULD BE DOING IN TERMS OF- I GUESS. BE SURE PEOPLE AT. TO THE SERVICES THEY NEED- YEAH HI HOW. DO PEOPLE SAY WELL WE NEED TO HAVE SOME GATEWAY RIGHT WE HAVE TO SOME DEFINITIONS SOME SOMETHING IT JUST CAN'T BE. COMPLETELY WIDE OPEN. BUT AND MAYBE THIS IS IT- BUT- BUT CLEARLY WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF WE HAVE DEFINITIONS LIKE YOU HAVE TO HAVE A POSITIVE TESTER AND BUYS OR SOMETHING IN MANY. AND I THINK EACH OF YOU LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT. YOU HAD BUNCH OF TESTS AND THEY'RE ALL NEGATIVE RATE THAT YOU CLEARLY HAVE SYMPTOMS AND SO FORTH- WHAT WHAT. WHAT HOW SHOULD WE APPROACH THIS FROM A POLICY POINT OF VIEW IN TERMS OF BEING FREE FOR PEOPLE HAVE ACCESS. TO SERVICES WHO ARE PEOPLE OF DISABILITIES RELATED TO- TO COVET OR LONG CODE OR POST CODE- DISEASE. SO HOW CAN HOW WE ADDRESS THAT GAP. I'M THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW I'LL BE INTERESTED IN WHAT OTHER PEOPLE TO SAY I DON'T. CLAIM EXPERTISE IN THIS ROUND BUT- YEAH I WOULD SAY THAT- YOU KNOW SOME OF WHAT I BELIEVE DOCTOR DIETZ MENTIONED EARLIER IN TERMS OF- LOOKING AT SYMPTOMS- SEEMS LIKE. A YOU KNOW A REALLY GOOD APPROACH- AND ALSO BEING REALLY COGNISANT OF. YOU KNOW THE DEFICIENCIES. IN TERMS OF- RECOGNIZING WHAT IS NORMALLY BEEN REQUIRED TO QUALIFY AND WHAT DOES NOT WORK IN THIS CONTEXT SO AS YOU SAID. RECOGNIZING THAT TESTING WAS NOT AVAILABLE AND THAT THERE CONTINUE TO BE LIMITS WITH TESTING RECOGNIZING THAT. HOSPITALIZATION IS NOT A PROXY FOR- WHETHER OR NOT SOMEBODY CAN HAVE LONG PROGRAM. RECOGNIZING THAT ANTIBODIES IS NOT NECESSARILY PRESS THE STAR. I THINK LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THE SYMPTOMS EVEN IF IT'S IN PERFECT. THAT TEND TO- THEY TEND TO YOU KNOW CORRELATE TO WITNESS. AND NOT- CREATING. UNNECESSARY HURDLES. ON OBSTACLES PARTICULARLY RECOGNIZING THE TREMENDOUS- SOCIAL SOCIOECONOMIC INEQUALITY. THAT PREVENTS MANY PEOPLE FROM. I'M GOING THROUGH AND YOU KNOW. CHECKING THE BOXES THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE OTHERWISE NECESSARY. READ ALSO BE REALLY INTERESTING ISN'T VASQUEZ'S OPINION BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE. SHE HAS EVEN MORE EXPERIENCE IN THIS REALM AND I FEEL LIKE I HAVE WHILE I AM AN ATTORNEY AND I CAN TALK ABOUT. KNOW WHAT IS REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW QUALIFY AS HAVING A DISABILITY UNDER THE ADA- I FEEL LIKE MUCH OF THAT MY EXPERIENCE HERE HAS BEEN. AS AN INDIVIDUAL NOT THE PATIENT. I'M I GUESS I WOULD JUST ADD ONE THAT. THE FRUSTRATE. OF FEELING LIKE I HAVE- DOES THE DESPERATION FOR TREATMENT THE DESPERATION FOR LIKE CREDIBILITY FOR PEOPLE TO BELIEVE WHAT I'M SAYING- AND NOT BEING ABLE TO POINT TO ANYTHING TANGIBLE HAS BEEN- A TREMENDOUSLY CHALLENGING PIECE OF THIS IS LED TO ALSO- YOU KNOW A LOT OF MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES. AND SO I THINK- JUST RECOGNIZING THE WAY THAT- STIGMA PLAYS INTO THEIR EYES AND RECOGNIZING THAT- YOU KNOW SOME OF THE NEED TO. DEFINE PEOPLE CAN LEAD TO ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES AND ALSO MAKE IT MORE OR- LESS LIKELY THAT PEOPLE EVEN CARE. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I AND AGAIN I. T. SERVICES ARE I THINK OUR EXPERTS HAD MENTIONED- THE FIRST PANEL MENTIONED THAT CERTAINLY COMES EVEN PEOPLE VERY MILDER PRACTICALLY SYMPTOMATIC. CAN ALSO DEVELOP LONG CODES OF THIS IDEA OF HOSPITALIZATION IS THE THRESHOLD OF THE SOUTHWEST. YES ON THE TAKE A GREAT QUESTION- THAT THE FIRST THING I'LL I'LL NOTE IS THAT- IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT IN THE BODIES- ARE ARE. NOT THE BEST WAY TO- IDENTIFY A PREVIOUS INSPECTION- AND IN FACT ESPECIALLY IN LONG COALBED THERE SEEMS TO BE SOME SORT OF CONNECTION BETWEEN NOT- WHAT'S CALLED CERRO CONVERTING NOT CREATING ANTIBODIES- OR SUFFICIENT ANTIBODIES OR TIMELY ANTIBODIES. AND LONG COVERT SYMPTOMS AGAIN PROBABLY NOT BE THE SAME THAT CAUSES LONG HOLD IT BUT THERE'S CERTAINLY SOME ASSOCIATION AND IT SEEMS REALLY PREVALENT IN OUR COMMUNITY- ALONG WITH PATIENTS WHERE- DESPITE NO MATTER WHEN WE'RE BEING TESTED WE ARE NOT- WE ARE NOT- AT PRODUCING. A DETECTABLE ANTIBODIES SO I REALLY REALLY WANT TO CAUTION POLICYMAKERS FROM- FROM USING TESTING AS A MEANS OF GATE KEEPING BOTH OUR CLINICAL CARE. RESEARCH COHORTS AND- AND BENEFITS BASED ON TESTING BECAUSE IT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT SENSITIVE ENOUGH TO. PICK UP EVEN THE MAJORITY OF ONE CALL THAT PATIENT I WOULD I WOULD SAY- IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW HOW DO WE ENSURE THAT FOLKS. ARE YOU KNOW. TRULY SICK TO GET- GET BACK THE FIFTH I WOULD I WOULD CHALLENGE POLICYMAKERS TO THINK ABOUT THE HISTORY OF MEDICAL GAS LIGHTING AND- UNDERMINING OUR PATIENT- NARRATIVES OF THEIR OWN ILLNESS AND REALLY CHALLENGE. YOU KNOW THE STATE AND POLICY MAKERS TO BELIEVE PATIENTS AND- YOU KNOW THEY ARE THE EXPERTS ON THEIR OWN EXPERIENCE AND THEIR BODIES I MEAN THERE WAS A HUGE- THERE'S A HUGE HISTORY OF. NOT JUST UNDERMINING WOMEN'S HEALTH EXPERIENCES AND DIMINISHING THEIR PAIN AND THEIR- THEIR NARRATIVES OF THEIR OWN SUFFERING- BUT THERE IS ALSO A VERY- A VERY STRONG- ANTI- AIDS. MOVEMENT IT'S THE NIHILISM EVEN JUST FOR RECENTLY SO I IT IS. IT FOR ME. I A DIAGNOSIS ONCE- ESPECIALLY ONCE IT'S DEVELOPED- MUST BE INCLUSIVE THAT MUST BE INCLUDED IN SORT OF BENEFITS EVALUATION- FOR EXAMPLE THERE'S NO TEST TO- DEFINE MIGRAINE. BUT PEOPLE THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO ARE DISABLED AND NOT FIND MY GREEN TO RECEIVE LONG TERM DISABILITY BENEFITS AND SO I WOULD REALLY STRONGLY ENCOURAGE US AGAIN IF POLICYMAKERS TO ACCEPT THAT LONG HOPE IT CAN BE CLINICALLY DEFINED BY. YOU KNOW SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHAT TO LOOK FOR BY YOU KNOW BY POST BY ROLE. AT EXPERT. AND NOT SPOTS WHERE I WOULD PUSH POLICYMAKERS TO GO IS TO CREATE A STRONG CLINICAL DEFINITION OF ONE KOVIC AND THEN EDUCATE DISABILITY- ADMINISTRATORS AND AUDITORS BECAUSE OFTEN WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM OTHER PATIENTS I MYSELF HAVE NOT. APPLIED FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS ALTHOUGH I HAVE I DO HAVE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR MY EMPLOYER- DIET THAT DISABILITY EVALUATORS ARE OFTEN QUICK TO UNDERMINE CLINICAL DIAGNOSES- EVEN WHEN DOCTORS ARE ARE ARE VERY THOROUGH AND FOR RENT AND DOCUMENTING A PATIENT'S DISABILITY IS- SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE NOT JUST. EDUCATION ON THAT CLINICIANS WHO ARE YOU KNOW SUPPORTING PATIENTS IN APPLYING FOR DISABILITY BENEFITS BUT WE NEED A MASSIVE. EDUCATION EFFORT ON DISABILITY ADMINISTRATORS AND AUDITORS- WHO WHO EVALUATE THESE CLAIMS AND MAKE DECISIONS BECAUSE- I THINK ALSO A LOT OF INSTITUTIONAL GENDER BIAS AND RACE AND ETHNICITY BIAS OFTEN COME INTO PLAY WHEN EVALUATING THESE CLAIMS AS WELL. AND THAT'S IT THANK YOU FOR CALLING THANK YOU AND MISTER PETERS DID YOU WANT. TO MAKE ANY ADDITIONAL REMARKS- THE THIS ISSUE. NO I THINK AT THE END THEY WERE VERY WELL SPOKEN TO I JUST THINK IT'S SOMETHING BE VERY HOT- THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT- THE COMBINATION BETTER DUE TO PEOPLE THAT NEED THEM ESPECIALLY IN AN EDUCATIONAL SETTING- I AVAILABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BUT YES THAT WAS THE LAST TIME YOU SAID EARLIER THANK YOU YOU KNOW I JUST WANTED TO ADD ON TO WHAT MS VASQUEZ SAID ABOUT- BELIEVING PEOPLE M. BELIEVING WOMEN IN PARTICULAR IT KIND OF REMINDS ME OF FIBROMYALGIA BEFORE THAT WAS- READILY DIAGNOSABLE I HAD A VERY GOOD FRIEND WHO IT TOOK ALMOST TEN YEARS FOR HER TO GET THAT DIAGNOSIS SO YES WE HAVE TO BE OPEN TO NEW THINGS I WANT TO BELIEVE PEOPLE I JUST DON'T THINK PEOPLE. GO TO THE DOCTOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE NOTHING BETTER TO DO AND MOST PEOPLE ON LIVE THEIR HEALTHIEST AND BEST LIFE AGAIN THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS ON THIS PANEL. HELLO THANK YOU ALL VERY SO VERY MUCH AND AGAIN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORIES- MISTERS I'M HOPING YOUR DAUGHTER LAUREN. IS GOING TO GET BETTER SOON I KNOW SHE'S- AND THEN ALSO- THIS PAST CHRISTMAS STAR HOPEFULLY THAT- YOUR SYMPTOMS HOPEFULLY WE CAN. STILL BE SOME RESOLUTION SOMETIME- AND- AGAIN PREACHER YOU TAKING THE TIME ALL OF YOU TAKING YOUR TIME OUT TO ADVOCATE AND SPEAK OUT SO WE CAN HEAR YOUR STORIES AND- AND HOPEFULLY- LEARN FROM THEM TO PURSUE- BETTER POLICIES. SO AGAIN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ARE WE GONNA MOVE IT ONTO OUR THIRD PANEL- ON STATEWIDE PLANNING PREPARATION RESPONSE SO AS WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH KOVIN- WHAT ARE WE DOING TO TRY TO ADDRESS LONG BECAUSE OF IT. AND PLEASE WE HAVE TWO PANELISTS WE HAVE DOCTOR COUPON WHO IS THE- CALIFORNIA STATE EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND DEPUTY DIRECTOR. FOR THE CENTER FOR DISEASES AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH. AND DOCTOR JOANN ELMORE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR OF INNOVATIVE SUPPORT FOR PATIENTS WITH SARS CODE TO INFECTIONS REGISTRY AT THE UNIVERSE ACCOUNT FORMULA LOS ANGELES. SO START WITH DOCTOR PUN WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR PANDA NEWMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR HAVING ME THIS AFTERNOON. I WANTED TO POSE ALSO AND JUST ECHO THE HUGE THANKS TO THE PRIOR SPEAKERS FOR SHARING THEIR EXPERIENCES THAT REALLY IS- HELPFUL AND MEANINGFUL TO ALL OF US AND TAKES A LOT OF COURAGE TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M HERE TODAY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH INFORMATION ABOUT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO ASSESS STUDY AND PREVENT POST CODE CONDITIONS. AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF OUR ACTIVITIES AND PLANS TO EVALUATE AND ADDRESS THE BROADER IMPACTS OF THIS DEVASTATING PANDEMIC ON CALIFORNIANS. AS WE TRANSITION INTO THIS NEXT PHASE OF THE PANDEMIC AND IMPLEMENTATION OF A SMARTER PLAN. THERE ARE SEVERAL KEY AREAS FOR CALIFORNIA TO FOCUS ON. IN ADDITION TO UNDERSTANDING THE DIRECT PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF INFECTION WITH SARS COULD BE TO- THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING TODAY AND FOCUSING ON- WE ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE LONG TERM HEALTH. ECONOMIC AND SOCIETAL CONSEQUENCES OF LIVING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. FOR BOTH SURVIVORS AND THOSE WHO DID NOT EXPERIENCE INFECTION. WE NEED TO ADDRESS RESEARCH ANALYSIS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE PANDEMIC. AND COMMUNITY LEVEL SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. AS WELL AS EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESSOF ECONOMIC EMPLOYMENT AND OTHER SOCIAL POLICY MEASURES. ON MITIGATING THE NEGATIVE EFFECTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON COMMUNITIES AND INDIVIDUALS. FINALLY THERE NEEDS REMEMBER STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT PUBLIC HEALTH AND ACADEMIC COLLABORATION TO ALIGN AND PRIORITISE APPLIED RESEARCH THAT BENEFITS ALL CALIFORNIANS. REQUESTING A CONCEPT PAPER TODAY TO OUTLINE OUR INITIAL THOUGHTS ON HOW OUR STATE SHOULD USE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO BUILD ON AND EXPAND OUR ACADEMIC PARTNERSHIPS TO DEVELOP A SUSTAINABLE INFRASTRUCTURE TO COLLABORATE AND LEAD TO LONG TERM IMPACT STUDY ALONG WITH OTHER RESEARCH ANALYSIS TO HELP US LEARN FROM THIS EXPERIENCE. AND BE BETTER AND MORE PREPARED FOR THE NEXT SURGES AND FUTURE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCIES AND PANDEMICS. WHILE WE'RE CONTINUING OUR RESPONSE TO THE ACUTE COMBAT IMPACTS OF COVER NINETEEN. WE ARE INVOLVED IN EFFORTS TO UNDERSTAND AND ADDRESS THE LONG TERM IMPACTS OF COME IN NINETEEN THE FOCUS OF OUR HEARING TODAY. THERE WERE MORE THAN EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION REPORTED CASES OF COMMON NINETEEN IN CALIFORNIA. ANALYSTS NINE HUNDRED CASES OF MULTI SYSTEM INFLAMMATORY SYNDROME IN CHILDREN INCLUDING A TAX. BECAUSE NOT ALL CASES ARE REPORTED THE ACTUAL NUMBER INFECTIONS IS MUCH HIGHER. WHILE THE PROPORTION. SAUDIS AS WAS RECENTLY DISCUSSED IT'S LIKELY THAT A LARGE NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS WILL BE AFFECTED. WE ALSO KNOW THIS DISEASE HAS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED SOME POPULATIONS MAGNIFYING PRE EXISTING DISPARITIES. WELL THE LONG TERM BURDEN OF POST CODE CONDITIONS ENOUGH WINDOW ON THE COVER NINETEEN PENNOCK HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE AN ENORMOUS DISABLING EVENT IN ADDITION TO BEING A CAUSE OF ACUTE ILLNESS AND DEATH. SO WHAT IS THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DOING TO EDUCATE AND INTERVENE. PREVENTION OF COURSE IS STILL INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT STUDIES AND FOUND A VACCINATION REMAINS THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT INFECTION THE STARS COULD BE TOO AND HAVE A LITTLE ON THE POST CODE CONDITIONS. CITY PAGES WORKING TO PROMOTE VACCINATIONS AND BOOSTERS ADAPTED DATE AS THE KEY ELEMENT TO PREVENT POST CODE CONDITIONS. AS WELL AS RECOMMENDING MASKING THAT HAS GOOD FRIEND FILTRATION. THOSE ARE SMARTER PLAN LAYS OUT AFTER SHOT THE MASKING AWARENESS IS THE NEXT ESSENTIAL STRATEGY. TO THAT END WE HAVE TAKEN SEVERAL ACTIVITIES TO KEEP ASSESSING COMMUNICATING AND COORDINATING ON POST CODE CONDITIONS. SOME OF THESE AWARENESS EFFORTS INCLUDE. WORKING AND COLLABORATION WITH UCSF AND UCLA ON THE INSPIRE STUDY WHICH YOU'LL HEAR A LOT MORE ABOUT DR ELMAR. A CDC SPONSORED STUDY AND AGAIN SHE'LL DESCRIBE THAT AND MORE DETAIL- WE'VE BEEN COLLABORATING WITH UCLA SINCE AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND WITH UCSF SINCE DECEMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND OUR PARTNERSHIP WITH ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA INSURERS THAT A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF THE STATE WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE INSPIRE COVERT. AND AGAIN YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT WITH THE NEXT BIGGER. AS FAR AS COMMUNICATION. WE'VE DEVELOPED VAGUELY ASK QUESTIONS- WE JUST RECENTLY LAUNCHED A WEB PAGE AND SOCIAL MEDIA MATERIALS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT LONG COVERED. IT JUST WENT LIVE ON DECEMBER TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND WE WILL PROVIDE THAT LINK AND I CAN ADD IT TO THE CHILD LATER AS WELL. WE'VE ALSO PARTNERED WITH RESOLVE TO SAVE LIVES TO SHARE THEIR VOICE IS ALONG COVERED CAMPAIGN. WHICH CONTAINS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCES OF PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH POST ACUTE COVERED AND IT FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO AGE GROUP. THE VIDEOS AND SOCIAL MEDIA MESSAGES IN THIS CAMPAIGN ARE PART OF OUR LONG COOK COMMUNICATION TOOL KIT. WHICH IS DESIGNED TO BE USED BY LOCAL HEALTH PROJECTIONS AND OTHER PARTNERS AND ENCOURAGE AGAIN THE OTHER SPEAKERS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS AS WELL AND- JUST AS TODAY ADDING THESE PERSONAL TESTIMONIES ARE SOME OF THE MOST MEANINGFUL WAYS TO. TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT TO PEOPLE. WE'RE ALSO PLANNING OUT REACH TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS AND THE PUBLIC AS WELL AS GENERAL EDUCATION MATERIALS WERE PREPARING THESE AND EXPECTED TO BE READY IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO. WE HAVE A DETAILED PLAN INCLUDING INFORMATIONAL FLYERS BROCHURES ADDITIONAL ONLINE CONTENT AND TRAINING WEBINARS ABOUT LONGER BUT- AND THEN FOR OTHER INTER AGENCY COORDINATION WERE PARTICIPATING AGAIN IN THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA LONG CODE WORKING GROUP. INITIALLY CONVENED BY THE UC OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT TO COORDINATE POST CODE CARE AND RESEARCH ACROSS THE UC SYSTEM. WE'VE BEEN INVITED TO JOIN DUE TO OUR EXISTING RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN HE SAID HE- AND OUR DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPING COLLABORATION WITH INSPIRE. SOME OTHER POSSIBLE NEXT STEPS ARE TO EXPAND OUR SURVEILLANCE EFFORTS- SO WE WANT TO ADOPT A MULTI FACETED APPROACH TO MEASURING THE BURDEN OF POST CODE CONDITIONS IN THE STATE. THERE ARE DIFFERENT STRATEGIES THAT WILL BE NEEDED TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS AND OF THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC IN CALIFORNIA. WE COULD ACTUALLY WORK TO DEVELOP THE CALIFORNIA CONSENSUS CASE DEFINITION AND CONSIDER MAKING CLOTHES BECAUSE THE CONDITIONS REPORTABLE DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA. WE ALSO COULD USE A CASE CONTROL STUDY FRAMEWORK TO GATHER DATA ON POST CODE CONDITIONS AND THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR DATA COLLECTION FROM A REPRESENTATIVE SAMPLE OF STATE RESIDENTS WITH AND WITHOUT HISTORY OF INFECTION. AND THEN AS I OPEN WITH ME REALLY ALSO WANT TO STUDY THE BROADER SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS PANDEMIC. WE ARE CONSIDERING THAT IT JUST SAYS THAT BROADER IMPACT AND HOPE TO LAUNCH EFFORTS WITHIN THE NEXT SIX MONTHS. IMPORTANT QUESTIONS TO CONSIDER ARE THE IMPACTS ON PERSONS WHO LOST FAMILY MEMBERS. DEFERRAL OF CARE FOR CHRONIC DISEASES DIFFER- HEALTH SCREENINGS. MENTAL HEALTH IMPACTS AND LOSS OF TIME AT SCHOOL FOR CHILDREN. WILL PARTNER WITH FEDERAL AND OR ACADEMIC ORGANIZATIONS ON BROAD SURVEYS OF PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA. POLICY ASSESSMENTS AND OTHER COLLABORATIVE RESEARCH TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS OF THIS PANDEMIC ON CALIFORNIANS. WE'RE VERY COGNIZANT OF SOCIETAL IMPLICATIONS BEYOND PUBLIC HEALTH INCLUDING THE NEED TO CONSIDER ACCESSIBILITY ADAPTABILITY AND ACCOMMODATIONS AND SURVIVORS TELLING LIES. AS IT RELATES TO EDUCATION EMPLOYMENT AND MORE. I OPPOSED TO CONSERVE PAPER US FOR ADDITIONAL INPUT AND FEEDBACK BY MARCH EIGHTEENTH AFTER WHICH TIME A LOT OF WORK GROUP OF PARTNERS AND FURTHER DEFINE PRIORITY STUDIES TO- RESOURCE AND WORK ON. AND I WAS STUCK THERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SO MUCH LOCKED UPON A NOTES MOVE ONTO DR ELMAR. WITH A VIEW TO. UCLA WELCOME. THANK YOU. WELL I AM WAS ASKED TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE INSPIRE STUDY AND I WANT TO STEP BACK AND SAY THAT- ONE OF THE BENEFITS OF THE PANDEMIC IS IT'S BRINGING US ALL TOGETHER IT'S BRINGING LEGISLATORS AND PATIENTS AND FAMILY MEMBERS AND CLINICIANS AND SCIENTISTS WE ALL HAVE A COMMON GOAL AND WE WANT TO WORK ON THIS TOGETHER AND I THINK BY JOINING FORCES AS UCLA HAS DONE WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH IN OUR ONE STUDY. YOU KNOW I THINK TOGETHER THE OUTCOME WILL BE BETTER SO IT HAS BEEN A PLEASURE COLLABORATING WITH THE STATE I WILL REFER EVERYONE TO OUR WEBSITE FOR UCLA STUDY IT'S INSPIRE LIKE TO BREED I. N. S. P. I. R. E. WE'RE RECRUITING OF QUITE A FEW THOUSAND PATIENTS AND WE HOPE TO HAVE INFORMATION THAT WE CAN SHARE WITH THE STATE IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. WE ARE RECRUITING PATIENTS AT THE TIME OF KOBE TESTING AND A UNIQUE FEATURE OF THE STUDY IS THAT WE HAVE WELCOME AND POSITIVE AND KOBE NEGATIVE INDIVIDUALS SO WE HAVE A CONTROL. I WAS ASKED. IN THINKING ABOUT WHAT YOU WANTED ME TO SAY TODAY I WAS ASKED TO TALK ABOUT. WHAT WE KNOW WHATWE DON'T KNOW AND WHAT MY SUGGESTIONS WOULD BE. SO TO START WITH WHAT WE KNOW. WE NOW NO LONGER EXISTS AND THIS IS A MONUMENTAL STEP FORWARD BECAUSE TRULY A YEAR AGO. PHYSICIANS AND SCIENTISTS DIDN'T BELIEVE IN SUCH AN ENTITY AND THIS IS IMPORTANT. AND THIS VALIDATES THE REALLY- HEARTFELT COMMENTS BY OUR THREE EARLIER SPEAKERS. THEN THE SECOND TOPIC IS WHAT WE DO NOT KNOW AND WHAT WE NEED TO STUDY- ALMOST EVERYTHING THERE IS BASICALLY. AN INFORMATION VOID WE DO NOT KNOW WHAT ARE THE MAIN FEATURES OF LONG CALLED IT WE DON'T KNOW HOW COMMON IT IS. I KNOW YOU WERE ASKING EARLIER SPEAKERS WHAT THEIR ESTIMATE IS WHAT PERCENTAGE IT MIGHT BE EVEN IF IT'S ONLY 5% OF PEOPLE THAT GET CODE HAVE LONG CALLED IT THAT IS AN ASTRONOMICALLY LARGE AND IMPACTFUL NUMBER- SO THE PERCENTAGES THAT ARE BEING REPORTED 510% TO FIFTY PERCENT- WE DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW IF IN THE FUTURE. TEN YEARS FROM NOW. WE MAY SEE LONG TERM EFFECTS FROM CODED THAT WE HAD EVEN ANTICIPATED THINK ABOUT SHINGLES BUT MANY OF US DEAL WITH DECADES AFTER- WE- WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DIAGNOSE LUNG KOBE. NOW THIS MAY SEEM STRANGE TO SOME IN THE AUDIENCE WE HAVE A C. D. C. IN A W. H. O. CASE SURVEILLANCE CRITERIA AND THESE ARE USEFUL WHEN YOU'RE STUDYING THINGS OUT BEFORE WE KNEW WHAT CAUSED AIDS. AND WE HAD CASE CRITERIAS BEFORE WE KNEW HOW TO DIAGNOSE LEGIONNAIRES DISEASE OR LYME DISEASE WOULD HAVE CASE CRITERIAS. AND SURVEILLANCE THAT WE THEN WOULD STUDY BUT THAT IS THAT IS NOT THE SAME THING IS WHEN I'M A DOCTOR I'M SEEING PATIENTS IN CLINIC AND I WANT TO KNOW HOW DO I DIAGNOSE I DON'T HAVE A BLOOD TEST I DON'T HAVE AN X. RAY. THAT WILL DEFINITIVELY TELL ME THAT THIS IS DUE. TO THE EARLY KOBE DISEASE AND WE NEED WE NEED HELP- WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE RISK FACTORS ARE. FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF LONG COATED. AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO TREAT. THERE'S BASICALLY THIS INFORMATION VOID IT'S KIND OF LIKE A PERFECT STORM PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE ANXIOUS AND SUFFERING THERE'S NOT ADEQUATE SUPPORT FOR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE MORE PATIENTS WE DON'T HAVE CAPACITY AND WE NEED TO SUPPORT COLLECTION OF HIGHER QUALITY EVIDENCE. IN ADDITION TO BEING A PHYSICIAN AND SEEING PATIENTS IN CLINIC I'M ALSO AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST AND NOW THAT WE HAVE THE PANDEMIC PEOPLE HAVE HEARD OF THAT WORD AN EPIDEMIOLOGIST I BASICALLY LIKE TO STUDY HOW TO DIAGNOSE AND TREAT DISEASES AND HOW TO DO A BETTER JOB. AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU S. GENEALOGIST. THIRTY ONE KOBE IS NOT EASY THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS- IT IS UNIQUELY CHALLENGING- ONE REASON HAS TO DO WITH ALL THE WASTE IT HAS CHANGED OVER TIME. EARLY ON WE COULDN'T EVEN DIAGNOSED WE DID HAVE DIAGNOSTIC CAPABILITIES THEN THERE BEEN THESE NEW ADDITIONS OF DIFFERENT TREATMENTS THAT HAVE COME INTO PLAY WE DON'T KNOW HOW THOSE WILL AFFECT SUBSEQUENT LONG CORRECT. THEN WE HAVE NEW VACCINES NOW WE HAVE DIFFERENT VARIANTS AND SO WE NEED TO LEARN HOW THESE EVOLVING CHANGES OVER TIME WE'RE GOING TO IMPACT LONG KOBE. I WILL BE FOR THE AUDIENCE TO A PAPER THAT I PUBLISHED YESTERDAY ACTUALLY IN THE ANNALS OF INTERNAL MEDICINE IT'S ONLY IT'S SHORT ONLY TWO PAGES LONG AND IT DESCRIBES SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT SCIENTISTS ARE GONNA HAVE AND WE NEED TO PAY ATTENTION AND BE CAREFUL AND STUDIES. I AM WORRIED THAT SOME OF THE EARLY STUDIES HAVE BEEN LOW QUALITY AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB PATIENTS TO SURVIVE. AND IT HAS BEEN MENTIONED BY OTHERS DISPARITIES IN HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE. THE PANDEMIC IS MAKING IT WORSE AND I'M VERY CONCERNED AS A POSITION OF THE PANDEMIC INCLUDING HIGHER INFECTION RATES AND HIGHER HOSPITALIZATION RATES IT HAS FALLEN DISPROPORTIONATELY ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ALREADY VULNERABLE. TO INEQUITIES IN HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW SO WE HAVE LONG KNOWN DISPARITIES AND I THINK THAT NEW INEQUITIES IN BOTH THE DEVELOPMENT THAT PRESENTATION AND DOCUMENTATION OF LONG CORBETT I THINK IT'S GONNA BE ECCENTRIC PROBLEMS- THE INVOLVING LONG KOBE CASE DEFINITION IT'S GOING TO BE INFLUENCED BY. PATIENTS THAT WE'RE SEEING IN CLINICS. NOT EVERYBODY CAN GET IN THE CLINICS IT'S GOING TO BE INFLUENCED BY HIS PARTICIPATING IN RESEARCH. AND BECAUSE MARGINALIZED GROUPS OFTEN RECEIVE LESS TIMELY DIAGNOSIS SO THEY OFTEN HAVE THEIR SYMPTOMS UNRECOGNIZED OR UNDOCUMENTED. I'M WORRIED THAT LONG CODE MAYBE UNDER DESCRIBED IN THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY VULNERABLE. I'LL CLOSE WITH THREE PRACTICAL SUGGESTIONS FOR OUR STATE FIRST IS REALLY. NOT SELF EVIDENT OUR BEST DEFENSE IN PREVENTING CODE IS WITH VACCINATIONS AND SO I ENCOURAGE US TO CONTINUE OUR REALLY IMPRESSIVE STATEWIDE EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EFFORTS. MY SECOND SUGGESTION IS- REALLY SIMPLE. WE NEED SMOKE DETECTORS. MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE US CANNOT SMELL NOW BECAUSE THEY'VE HAD CALLED IT THIS IS WAS ONE OF THE FIRST LONG COALBED. YOU KNOW SYMPTOMS THAT BECAME APPARENT. YOU KNOW I'VE I'VE DIAGNOSED KOBE IN PATIENTS THAT. CALL ME UP BECAUSE THEY SAID THEY HAD A CUP OF COFFEE AND TEY COULDN'T SMELL THE CAFFEINE IN THE COFFEE AND THEY WONDERED WHY AND I SAID GO GET TESTED FOR COLD AND THEY HAD KOPEN. AND NOW A YEAR LATER THEY STILL CAN'T SMELL- IN ADDITION TO HAVING A REDUCED YOU KNOW QUALITY OF LIFE YOUR SENSE OF TASTE YOUR ENJOYMENT YOU CAN'T SMELL THE FLOWERS. YOU CAN'T SMELL FIRES AND SO A SIMPLE SUGGESTION IS- RAMPING UP OUR EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS- REGARDING SMOKE DETECTORS IT'S ESTIMATED THAT THERE ARE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE IN THE U. S. NOW THAT I HAVE REDUCED. SENSE OF SMELL THIS AND KNOWS ME UP. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT 95% OF PEOPLE THAT HAVE IT ONLY LASTS FOR A FEW WEEKS TO MAYBE A FEW MONTHS. BUT IT'S NOT THE 225% HOW PERSISTENT AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW LONG BUT I HAVE SOME PATIENCE IT. IT'S DEFINITELY PERSISTENT FOR TWO YEARS. NOT MY FINAL SUGGESTION WILL BE. RESONATING WITH EARLIER COMMENTS IT HAS TO DO WITH THE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE. FOR MANY YEARS I HAVE WORKED IN DOING RESEARCH IN CANCER AND HIV AND SEEING PATIENTS WITH CANCER AND HIV. IN THE U. S. WE PROVIDE OUTSTANDING QUALITY OF CARE AND WE HAVE AMAZING STRIDES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE IN RESEARCH ENDEAVORS. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THESE ARE USUALLY DONE ON THE BACKBONE OF. COMPREHENSIVE CANCER CENTERS OR CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE FOR HIV CARE. WE WE'RE UNDERSTAFFED AND UNDER POWERED YOU KNOW I THINK A LOT OF THE LONG COLD MEDICATIONS THEY NEED TO GET FUNNELED INTO PRIMARY CARE TO START WITH AND THAT IS BECAUSE THERE'S SUCH A WIDE RANGE OF SYMPTOMS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH LONG COAT AND THEN WE NEED CARE COORDINATORS AT THE CENTERS THAT CAN HELP YOU NAVIGATE THROUGH ALL OF THE MANY SOME SPECIALISTS FROM CARDIOLOGISTS TO A NEUROLOGIST WE DIDN'T NEED SUPPORT FOR PHYSICAL THERAPISTS REHABILITATION AT THEIR BEST THEN WE NEED SOCIAL WORKERS TO HELP THESE PEOPLE WITH THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND FINANCIAL ISSUES. I THINK THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH SYSTEM IS POISED TO TAKE ON SUCH A ROLE. THE UC SYSTEM IT'S REALLY A CROWN JEWEL IN OUR STATE IT'S LARGE IT'S MASSIVE. AND THE HEALTH SYSTEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH ACADEMIC POWERHOUSES FOR RESEARCH THE SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE IN THE SCHOOLS OF PUBLIC HEALTH- THIS. NETWORK IS UNLIKE ANY OTHER IN THE COUNTRY. SO I WOULD REALLY WANT TO SECOND OR THIRD THIS IDEA OF CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE. I SHOULD SAY THOUGH THAT- I HEARD SOME OF THE PATIENTS TALK ABOUT HOW THEY COULDN'T GET IN TO SEE ANYONE. THAT IS A REAL ISSUE NOW AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE. MANY OF THE POSITIONS ARE VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME TRYING TO HELP OUT AND SO- I REALLY THINK THAT GOING FORWARD ALL WORKING TOGETHER- I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN IMPROVE PRESS. I WANNA THANK EVERYONE FOR BRINGING THE TOPIC OF LONG CODED TO THE FOREFRONT WE HAVE A LONG HAUL AHEAD OF US AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE'S SUPPORT AND ENCOURAGEMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH- DR- MORE- QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS- CENTER NEWMAN. THANK YOU MR CHAIR SHOW PROFESSIONAL FIRST THANK YOU TO BOTH OF THE PANELISTS SAID DR POT IT'S BEEN A YOU KNOW JUST A PLEASURE WORKING WITH YOU- AS ONE OF THE LEADERS LET'S SAY CORNER A GROUP OF LAST YEAR- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY AND ALSO OUR- OUR COMPLIMENTS WE'VE ALL BEEN COMPANY HERE ON THIS ONE FOR GLASSES THAT MATCH YOUR BACKGROUND SO WELL. AND DR- MORE I- YOU KNOW TO YOUR POINT ABOUT LOSING ONE'S SENSE OF TASTE I ACTUALLY- TECH COVE AND I LOST MY SENSE OF TASTE OFFERED A COUPLE OF DAYS AND IT WAS IT IT'S HARD TO APPRECIATE WHAT YOU'VE BEEN THROUGH IT JUST HOW. IMPACTFUL THAT IS IT WAS A BUILDING ON THAT I'D LIKE TO ASK BOTH OF YOU TO SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH DIMENSIONS. OF LONG COVE IN PARTICULAR AS WE AS WE THINK ABOUT- THE YOU KNOW THE WAYS IN WHICH WE SHOULD INTEGRATE AND OORDINATE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE- YOU KNOW THE OTHER PHYSICAL. NEEDS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED TODAY SHOULD BE INTEREST IN BOTH YOUR COMMENTS HERE. SURE I'LL START AND JUST SAY YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY I THINK AND SOME OF THEM BECAUSE HERE'S HOW MULTI DISCIPLINARY. THIS IS GOING TO NEED TO BE NOT ONLY FOR THE HEALTH AND MENTAL HEALTH THAT BUT ALL THE OTHER IMPACTS AS WELL IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF EFFORTS TO IMPROVE OVERALL INTEGRATION OF MENTAL HEALTH AND- AND MEDICAL. HEALTH AND I THINK AS A STARTER HOME OR MENTION I THINK WE'RE JUST SCRATCHING THE SURFACE ON A LOT OF THE IMPACTS OF. LONG HOOD AND OTHER IMPACTS OF CODE IN GENERAL- SO. THINK AGAIN ARE INTENDED TO BE VERY MULTI DISCIPLINARY- ACROSS DIFFERENT HEALTH DISCIPLINES AS WELL AS- OTHER- SOCIAL SERVICES OTHER POLICY MAKERS AT CETERA. THE PANDEMIC ITSELF HAS LED TO AN INCREASE AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES CERTAINLY MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE DEPRESSED AND ANXIOUS- I THINK THAT THIS OBVIOUSLY WILL NEED TO BE A KEY COMPONENT OF THE CENTERS AND SUPPORT- VOICES OF THE PATIENTS NEED TO BE HEARD WITH COMPASSION AND THEY NEED ACCESS TO INFORMATION AND ACCESS TO CLINICAL TRIALS AND I THINK IF OF OUR COMMUNITY HEARS THAT WE WANNA ALL WORK TOGETHER YOU KNOW WILL IT WILL BE BETTER IN THE END- IF YOU THINK ABOUT DEPRESSION WE ALSO HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THE HEALTH CARE WORKERS. YOU KNOW THEY'RE TIRED IT'S BEEN A LONG TWO YEARS FOR EVERYONE. I APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK. EARLIER THANK YOU SENATOR PAN THANK YOU TO BOTH OF THE DOCTORS FOR THEIR EXPERTISE A DOCTOR ELMORE I HAD A QUESTION WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT WE DON'T KNOW THE MAIN FEATURES OF LONG COVE IT HOW ARE WE GOING ABOUT FIGURING OUT WHAT THOSE ARE- THIS IS GOING TO SEEM OVERLY SIMPLISTIC I'M NOT A DOCTOR DO IS PEOPLE COME IN DO YOU ASK THEM DID YOU HAVE COVERED AND THEN MAYBE IT'S KIND OF LIKE A CHECKLIST OF WHAT THEY HAVE AND DON'T HAVE THE DO YOU CROSS REFERENCE THAT WITH WHAT OTHER FOLKS HAVE TO HOPEFULLY COME UP WITH SOME DATA. IN THE FUTURE THAT CAN HELP MORE EASILY DIAGNOSED LONG COVERED. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION- I SUSPECT IN THE END THERE ARE GOING TO BE MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF LONG COVE IT NOSE MIA THE INABILITY TO SMELL BUT THAT IS VERY IMPACTFUL. OTHERS MAY JUST HAVE NEUROLOGIC SOME MAY HAVE CARDIAC SOMEBODY JUST TEMPERAMENTAL LOGIC. AND IN THE STUDIES FOR EXAMPLE IN THE INSPIRE STUDY WE ARE HAVING PATIENTS FILL OUT SURVEYS REALLY LONG LIST OF SYMPTOMS AND THEY CHECK OFF WAT SYMPTOMS THEY HAVE AND THEN WE'RE FOLLOWING THEM FORWARD EVERY THREE MONTHS TO FIND OUT ARE THOSE SYMPTOMS STILL PRESENT ARE THEY GOING AWAY FOR THE DEVELOPING NEW SYMPTOMS AND WHEN YOU ARE ABLE AND HAVE THOUSANDS OF PATIENTS PARTICIPATING IN HELPING YOU IN THIS STUDY. YOU THEN CAN COMPARE THE RATE OF SYMPTOMS IN THOSE THAT HAD COAL BED TO THE RATE AND THOSE THAT WERE COMMON NEGATIVE WE'RE RECRUITING PATIENTS AT THE TIME WHERE THERE THEY THINK THEY'RE SYMPTOMATIC WITH AN ACUTE CO INFECTION YOU KNOW THERE THEY'VE GOT A FEVER A COUGH DON'T FEEL WELL- AND THEN WE TAKE THEM REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE COMMON POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE AND SO THIS WAY YOU HAVE CONTROLS AND THERE'S A CERTAIN LOW RATE BACKGROUND A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE HAVE HEADACHES EXCEPT HER BUT WHEN YOU CAN COMPARE THE RATE. GOING FORWARD OVER MONTHS TO A. YEAR OR TWO. AND YOU SEE. FIVE SYMPTOM POP OUT AS BEING STATISTICALLY SIGNIFICANT AND MUCH MORE COMMON IN PEOPLE THAT HAD KOBE. THAT'S HOW YOU GET THE ANSWER. BUT YOU'RE RIGHT IT'S VERY CONFUSING- AND SCIENTIFICALLY IT'S A MESS ALL OF THE PUBLICATIONS ARE USING DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS- AND SO IT'S HARD TO COMPARE IT'S LIKE YOU'RE COMPARING APPLES TO ORANGES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU SIR RUBIO. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- I HAVE A SIMILAR QUESTION TO THAT OF A MY COLLEAGUE THAT JUST HAS TO QUESTION IT JUST SEEMS THAT THE INFORMATION IS ALL OVER THE PLACE AND I RIGHTFULLY SO THIS IS SOMETHING NEW AND EVERYONE'S DEALING WITH DIFFERENT THINGS BUT JUST BASED ON THE STORIES THAT STACYAND ANGELA AND JENNIFER SHARED. OB SORRY THERE'S A LOT THAT WE'RE LEARNING FROM THESE CASES AND IN PARTICULAR THE INS FIRE STUDY I'M JUST CURIOUS HOW ARE WE GETTING INFORMATION DOWN TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION AND YOU'RE LEARNING AS YOU GO BUT I'M JUST STILL TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW DO WE FIND A CENTRALIZED PLACE. WHERE ALL THIS INFORMATION IS READILY AVAILABLE FOR EVERYONE YOU KNOW AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- SO THEY CAN CONTINUE TO SORT OF MONITOR IN THEIR OWN WAY IS THERE CONNECTIONS CAN YOU HELP ME UNDERSTAND HOW ARE WE CONNECTING ALL THE PIECES FROM LOCAL I. HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO OUR STATE TO THE STUDY THAT INSPIRE IS DOING AND ALL THE STORIES THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM. FROM OUR PATIENTS HOW ARE WE MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE'S HEARING THE SAME THING INSTEAD OF EVERYONE AND I THINK I HEARD YOU SAY IT'S A MESS WE'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE THAT WAS SOMETHING YOU SAID HOW DO WE BRING IT TOGETHER I WANT YOU TO HELP US UNDERSTAND OR HELP YOU HOW DO WE BRING IT TOGETHER SO EVERYONE HAS THE SAME INFORMATION. YEAH I CAN. TAKE DOWN AN EARLY START I THINK- YOU KNOW CERTAINLY AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR LOCAL VETERANS WE ACTUALLY JUST WITHIN A COUPLE- ACTUALLY RECENTLY- PRESENTATIONS ARE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ABOUT KIND OF THE WORK WE'RE DOING ESPECIALLY THIS NEW OUT REACH EFFORTS- AROUND THE PUBLIC COMMUNICATIONS AND MORE INFORMATION- AND THEN AS THE BALLS AND- AND ONE THING I MENTIONED JUST TO. TO REITERATE AND IT WILL COURSE BE TALKING TO YOU KNOW IF THE CDC IS GONNA COME UP WITH A COMMON CASE DEFINITION OR NOT. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION TODAY ABOUT THE CHALLENGES OF THAT BUT- IF WE DO DO THAT EITHER NATIONALLY OR OR AT THE STATE LEVEL WE CAN. WORK TO COLLECT THAT DATA- MORE COMPREHENSIVELY AT A MINIMUM WITHIN CALIFORNIA AND THEN WORK WITH OUR OUR PARTNERS TO KIND OF RECEPTIONIST US THE OTHER THING THAT ACTUALLY WE HAVE. JUST LAUNCHED RECENTLY AS WELL IS- IN KIND OF OUR STATEWIDE SYSTEM THAT HAS- CASES AND CONTACTS AND ACTUALLY THERE ARE WAYS TO KIND OF SEND AUTOMATED SERVICE. ABOUT POST CODE SYMPTOMS SO THAT IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN LAUNCHED- WE'RE JUST NOW STARTING TO. INCREASE UTILIZATION OF IT BUT IT'S ANOTHER WAY WE CAN TRY TO HAVE MORE CONSISTENT DATA COLLECTION ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN OF COURSE YOU KNOW AS MENTIONED EARLIER BUT REALLY THE OTHER KIND OF. LINK THAT NEEDS TO BE THERE IS HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS ARE SEEING PATIENTS AND REALLY HAVING ALL OF THAT- SORT OF ALL OF US. REALLY QUICK MEETING ORGANIZED. TOGETHER THANKS. I CAN TELL TO THAT THAT THE- UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF THE PRESIDENT- THEY HAVE CONVENE TO HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS FROM. ALL OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SCHOOL OF MEDICINE. AND WE HAVE REGULAR MEETINGS WE ARE SHARING. BEST PRACTICES FOR AT LEAST WHAT WE THINK IS THE BEST PRACTICE- WITH THIS VOID OF INFORMATION AND WE DISTRIBUTE THE INFORMATION TO ALL OF THE ACADEMIC HEALTH CENTERS ON FOR EVERY ORGAN SYSTEM LIKE FOR SOMEONE THAT COMES IN WITH NEUROLOGIC SYMPTOMS OR SOMEONE THAT COMES IN WITH CARDIAC HEART RATE INSTABILITY OR SOMEONE THAT COMES IN WITH. CHANGE IN THEIR TOES COLORS TO PURPLE WHAT IS THE SUGGESTED STANDARDIZED EVALUATION AND WHAT ARE SOME EARLY IDEAS FOR TREATMENT OPTIONS THAT MIGHT HELP AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO SHARE INFORMATION AND WE'VE EVEN HAD DISCUSSIONS ON HOW WE- AS EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS WE HAVE A COMMITMENT. TO HELP EDUCATE ALL OF THE MANY OTHER PROVIDERS IN OUR STATE WHO DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME INFORMATION WE HAVE- I KNOW- JUST A WEEK AGO I WAS GIVING A TALK TO ALL OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. IN THE DEPARTMENT OF MENTAL HEALTH IN LA COUNTY- I GAVE THAT TALK WITH THE PROFESSOR OF NEUROLOGY AND A PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT UCLA SO WE'RE WE'RE SLOWLY TRYING TO GET THE WORD OUT BUT I THINK YOUR QUESTION IS SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO CONSIDER FURTHER. THANK YOU. THANKS THE OTHER QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS BRIEF QUESTION AND THAT WE ARE SORT OF COMING CLOSE TO THE END OF OUR TIME SO I WANNA BE SURE WE GET OUR LAST ENOUGH TIME FOR LAST PANEL HERE BUT- SO ON A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN I MEAN IT WAS IT YOU SEE- UC DAVIS. AND I CAN IMAGINE THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS LISTENING TO THIS AND IF WE ARE AGAIN VERY SYMPATHETIC TO ALL THE PATIENTS YOU KNOW WHEN THE EXPERTS ARE SAYING WHAT'S STILL A MASS FOR THE DEFINITION IS AND THEN MEANTIME WE'RE EXPECTED TO FILL OUT PAPERWORK CERTIFYING AT THE RISK OF UP ALLOW LICENSE IT'S AT AROUND AT DOWN SOMEONE'S. NEEDS QUALIFICATION FOR DISABILITY ETCETERA AND STILL SORT OF VAGUE OUT THERE WHAT KIND OF SUPPORT OR WE CAN PROVIDE A TICKET FROM A CHAIR POSITIONS TO BE ABLE TO AND IT MEANS THAT THEY NEED AN ACCESS TO MULTI DISPLAY TEAM ALL RIGHT THEY CAN TRY TO PUT ONE TOGETHER THROUGH REFERRALS BUT- WHICH I NEED TO GIVEN THE NUMBERS THAT'S HAPPENING WITH SOMETHING MORE SYSTEMATIC. SO THAT THE PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS COULD HAVE MORE CONFIDENCE THAT ACTUALLY CAN HELP THE PATIENTS MORE AS WELL I THINK YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET KEEP WE'RE JUST TRYING TO FIGUREOUT BUT OFTEN TIMES THE BURDEN OF QUOTE UNQUOTE CERTIFYING SUPPORT FALLS ON HIS PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS WHO- YOU KNOW WHAT TO SAY YES BUT THEN AT THE SAME TIME. THEY FEEL LIKE THAT NO I CAN'T DO THE WHOLE VALUATION MYSELF AND ESPECIALLY IF THE EXPERTS THAT WE WERE HEARING FROM THEIR LIKE IT'S ALL OVER THE MAP WELL HOW'S THAT FRONTLINE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS TO FIGURE OUT ON THEIR OWN RIGHT- SO. MAYBE I GUESS THE QUESTION IS THAT OUR SUGGESTION IS THAT THE STATE SET UP MULTI DISCIPLINARY EVALUATION TEAMS THAT PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR CAN REFER TO WHETHER TO USE YOUR SOMETHING BUT IT'S GONNA AND WE HAVE TO HAVE A LOT MORE CAPACITY WE CAN'T HAVE LIKE OH BY THE WAY AND EXPLAIN IN SIX MONTHS. JUST I GUESS IN THE SAME WAY WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE IN THE D. YOU CAN I CAN REFER SOMEONE TO REGIONAL CENTER YOU KNOW I MAY MAKE AN INITIAL DIAGNOSIS I THINK THE CHILD HAS AUTISM SIMILAR DEVELOPED A DELAY BUT ACTUALLY THEY CAN DO AN EVALUATION AND START BEGINNING SERVICES SO- I CAN YOU CAN USE IS THAT MAYBE OUR ASSETS THAT HAVE- DUCK POND. IS. THERE SOME CONSIDERATION OF THAT- GOING ON IN AND IN SOME THIS. OF AT ST I WOULDN'T SAY SIT C. P. H. BUT AT. A YOU AWARE DISCUSSIONS. THAT NATURE. I'M NOT AWARE YET OF ANY OF THOSE LIKE TAKE THAT BECAUSE BACK IN. HELLO OKAY ALL RIGHT AND THEN I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU SEE- I MEAN AGAIN I KNOW YOU HAVE REFERRED FROM UCLA ETCETERA BUT- I MEAN IS THERE SOME THOUGHT ABOUT BASICALLY BUT DOES MEAN OPENING THE DOORS YOU HAVE A LOT OF PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS OUT THERE SAYING I'M TRYING TO STRUGGLE I HAVE A PATIENT WHO SEEMS LIKE THEY HAVE LONG COVETED. YOU KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE THAT TESTS ARE NEGATIVE A LOT CETERA BUT WHO CAN I SEND THEM TO GET A MORE DEFINITIVE VALUATION AND I AM ABLE TO DO IN MY OFFICE. WELL WE HAVE A- TSUNAMI OF PATIENTS THAT. WANT TO GET IN AND THAT WILL BE COMING. AND RIGHT- IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF IN THE STATE THERE WAS. A BETTER SUPPORT FOR THIS. THANK YOU. OKAY SO SOUNDS LIKE AN IDEA I MEAN I REALIZE THAT DOZENS OF OLD WORKFORCE ISSUES BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW HOW DEEPLY SURE WE ASSURE ACCESS. TO SERVICES AT CETERA AND HOW TO PROVIDE SUPPORT. TO PEOPLE SO THAT WE CAN BE SURE AT LEAST. WE CAN GET A QUALIFIED FOR EXISTING SERVICES OBVIOUSLY AS WELL AS DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL SERVICES ARE NECESSARY. ALL RIGHT- SEE NO THE QUESTION LOOKS AT THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH BOTH OF YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION LOOKING FORWARD TO FOLLOWING UP AND AGAIN WE CAN ALSO APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION ON TO INSPIRE REGISTRY AS WELL. CAN BE EXTREMELY VALUABLE TO ALL OF US. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'LL MOVE ON TO OUR LAST PANEL ON LONG TERM COSTS AND CONSEQUENCES IN RIPLEY'S WE HAVE. DR GREG IT IS CONFIRMED HIS MEDICAL DIRECTOR AT MAYO THE MAYO CLINIC COVERT ACTIVITY REHABILITATION PROGRAM AND THEN ALSO A DOCTOR JENNIFER KAMINSKI WHOSE- DEPUTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER RIVERSIDE COUNTY THE PRIME PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALSO PUBLISHED I'D DONE NUMEROUS- PAPERS AS WELL ARTICLES AROUND THE LONG TERM COST CONSEQUENCES A CODED AND SO LET'S BEGIN WITH THAT DOCTOR FINNISH CULTURAL- FROM THE MAYO CLINIC THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND- SPEAKING TO US IN CALIFORNIA. READ BY MEMBERS OF THE SENATE COLLEAGUES AND PATIENTS THANK YOU FOR SHARING PART OF YOUR DAY WITH ME I'M REALLY ONORED TO BE HERE. SO AGAIN MY NAME IS A GREAT MINISTER SHARON AND I'M AN OCCUPATIONAL AND AEROSPACE MEDICINE PHYSICIAN AT THE MAYO CLINIC IN ROCHESTER MINNESOTA. ALSO THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR FOR OUR CALL THAT ACTIVITY REHABILITATION PROGRAM. AND WE HAD THE PEASURE TO VISIT WITH PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM LONG HAUL COVE IT SINCE ABOUT MAY OF TWO THOUSAND TWENTY. AND I WANTED TO SHARE SOME INSIGHTS INTO LOCAL MADE IT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. AS AN OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE PHYSICIAN. WE'VE HEARD TODAY FROM MANY COLLEAGUES AND EXPERTS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE PATIENTS ABOUT THE KINDS OF SYMPTOMS. THAT PEOPLE EXPERIENCE WITH LONG HAUL CODED. IN THEIR STORIES ARE ACCURATE WITH WHAT WE HAVE SEEN ALSO IN OUR PATIENT POPULATIONS HERE. IN THIS SLIDE YOU CAN SEE A DISTRIBUTION OF THE KINDS OF SYMPTOMS THAT WE HAVE SEEN THE PATIENTS IN OUR CARPET CLEANING CAN AGAIN AT THE VERY TOP. OUR FATIGUE AND RESPIRATORY COMPLAINTS BUT THAT'S ONLY THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG WE ALSO SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF NEUROLOGICAL ISSUES. A LOT OF BRAIN FOG AS WELL AND SLEEP ISSUES AS WELL AS TROUBLES WITH MENTAL HEALTH. NOW WHEN MOST PEOPLE THINK ABOUT LONG HAUL PROVE IT. WHAT THEY THINK ABOUT ARE THE SYMPTOMS LIKE THIS BUT IN REALITY THIS IS ONLY ONE HALF OF THE PICTURE. AND THE OTHER HALF AND WHAT I WOULD ARGUE IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT. IS HOW THIS CONDITION REALLY IMPAIRS THE ABILITY OF THE PATIENT TO LIVE THEIR LIVES. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON FROM THE VERY BEGINNING AS AN OCCUPATIONAL MEDICINE CLINIC. AT THE TIME OF PRESENTATION OVER 30% OF OUR PATIENTS REPORTED DIFFICULTIES WITH SOME OF THE MOST BASIC ACTIVITIES OF LIFE ON A DAILY BASIS. THINGS LIKE BEING ABLE TO TAKE A SHOWER OR BE ABLE TO PUT THEIR CLOTHES ON OR USE THE BATHROOM. 82% REPORTED DIFFICULTIES WITH THE MORE ROUTINE THINGS LIKE. GOING GROCERY SHOPPING OR TAKING CARE OF HOUSEHOLD CHORES. WERE GOING TO WORK. NOW 63% OF THE PATIENTS THAT WE HAVE SEEN OUR CLINIC HAD BEEN ABLE TO GET BACK TO WORK BY THE TIME THEY STARTED HERE WITH US. AND THAT SOUNDS PROMISING BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT AT THE TIME THAT WE DID THE SURVEYING THE AVERAGE TIME BETWEEN THE INFECTION AND PRESENTATION WITH OUR CLINIC WAS THREE MONTHS. SO ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THIS IS THAT AFTER THREE MONTHS FROM INFECTIONS START ONLY A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN HALF OF PATIENTS ARE GETTING BACK TO THEIR LIVELIHOOD. ON TOP OF THAT OF THOSE PATIENTS THAT ARE BACK MANY OF THEM WERE WORKING REDUCED HOURS OR HAD OTHER KINDS OF WORK RESTRICTIONS. AGAIN THIS IS WHAT WE HAVE SEEN HERE IN OUR OWN CLINIC BUT THIS IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH WHAT'S BEEN FOUND AT OTHER CLINICS ACROSS THE UNITED STATES AND ACROSS THE WORLD. SO FOR EXAMPLE IN MOUNT SINAI AND WHICH IS ONE OF THE FIRST LOCALLY CLINICS IN THE COUNTRY- THIS IS A DIAGRAM THAT COMES IN THEIR PATIENT POPULATION WHICH YOU CAN SEE IN THE DARK BARS ARE- EMPLOYMENT STATUS BEFORE COATED. IN A LIGHT GRAY BARS AFTER. IN WHICH YOU CAN SEE IS OF COURSE THE FULL TIME WORK IS DECREASING AS TIME GOES ON PART TIME WORK GOES UP. RESUME PLAYMATE GO UP AND THOSE WHO ARE RETIRED GOAL OF. AND AS FOR THE LONGEVITY OF THESE KINDS OF FUNCTIONAL LIMITATIONS THERE IS NOT GOOD NEWS. AS MENTIONED EARLIER WE'RE ALMOST NOW TWO YEARS ALICE INTO TRYING TO MANAGE THIS CONDITION AND WE DO HAVE THE INFORMATION NOW ABOUT HOW PATIENTS ARE DOING. OVER THE LONG TERM BIKE THE STUDY THAT CAME OUT OF NEW YORK. LOOKING AT HOW FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY PATIENTS WERE DOING TWELVE MONTHS AFTER THEY WERE DISCHARGED FROM THE HOSPITAL. AND WHAT WE SEE FROM THAT SURVEY IS THAT 41% OF PATIENTS REPORTED WORSE HEALTH STILL THAN THEIR BASELINE BEFORE CALLED IT. 45% ALMOST HAVE PERSISTENT SYMPTOMS MORE ALARMING THEIR FUNCTION WAS ALSO LIMITED 36% REPORTED DIFFICULTIES WITH CARRYING THEIR GROCERIES ALMOST 40% HAD TROUBLES WALKING UP A FLIGHT OF STAIRS. SO THE FUNCTIONAL DEFICITS THEY CAN STICK AROUND FOR QUITE A LONG TIME. A QUESTION I'M OFTEN ASKED WHEN THIS INFORMATION IS PRESENTED AS WHY ARE PATIENTS WITH LONG COAT WOULD LOSING THEIR JOBS. MOST WOULD THINK THAT THE ANSWER IS PRIMARILY TIME AGENTS ARE JUST NOT GETTING BETTER FAST ENOUGH. HOWEVER IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT GETTING SOMEONE BACK TO WORK EVOLVES MORE THAN JUST MAKING SOMEONE FEEL BETTER. THERE ARE MULTIPLE FACTORS AT PLAY WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTERACTION BETWEEN WORK AND HEALTH NEEDS WHY I HAVE A JOB IN HIS CAREER. FOR EXAMPLE MANY EMPLOYERS ARE VERY CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN DO TO HELP EMPLOYEES. WITH LONG HAUL CODE WOULD COME BACK TO WORK SUCCESSFULLY. THE USUAL RESPONSE BY EMPLOYER GROUPS WHEN CHALLENGED WITH THIS CONDITION. WELL PLEASE DON'T COME BACK UNTIL YOU ARE 1100% BETTER. WHAT I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF US START THE DAY WITH 1100% OF FEELING WELL WHEN IT COMES TO OUR WORK SO THIS IS A VERY DIFFICULT CHALLENGE FOR MANY EMPLOYEES. SO THE POINT I REALIZE AGAIN THAT THERE ARE SO MANY THINGS THAT ARE LEFT TO BE ADDRESSED IN ADDITION TO MEDICAL CARE. TO HELP PEOPLE GET BACK TO THEIR LIVELIHOODS. IN THE MEANTIME WITH THIS KIND OF DATA AND BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE CLINICS. I AM WORRIED THAT WE'RE GONNA BE FACING A TIDAL WAVE OF PATIENTS UNABLE TO RETURN TO WORK FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF TIME DUE TO LONG COATED. AND I REALLY FEAR WHAT THIS MAY DO TO OUR WORLD AS WE KNOW IT. WE DID HAVE A PREVIEW OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN DURING THIS LAST HOLIDAY SEASON. MANY OF YOU REMEMBER THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF HOLIDAY FLIGHTS YOU MAY CANCEL AT THE WORST TIME. DUE TO PATIENTS- HE'S MADE DUE TO FLIGHT CREWS. AND PILOTS BEING OUT OF WORK DUE TO OVERCROWDING. WE ALSO HEARD STORIES OF. FIRE DEPARTMENTS IN CINCINNATI HAVING TO WORK OVERTIME BECAUSE OF THE STAFF SHORTAGE. SO THERE IS A POTENTIAL IMPACT ON OUR WORLD OUR SOCIETY OR ECONOMY. DUE TO THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM LONG COATED. OF COURSE THE WORKFORCE ISSUES ONLY ONE OF MANY CHALLENGES AND THEY MY COLLEAGUES THEY HAD MENTIONED SOME OF THESE ALREADY SOLVED JUST IN BRIEF. ONE THING THAT I DO WORRY ABOUT VERY MUCH SO IS THAT WE ARE NOT SEEING ALL PATIENT POPULATIONS. REPRESENTED IN THIS GROUP INCLUDING INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE COMING FROM OTHER KINDS OF JOBS LIKE. MORE LABOR INDUSTRIES AND SO FORTH. WE ALSO DON'T HAVE A GOOD WAY OF ASSESSING IMPACTS ACROSS THE NATION OR A STATE WIDE FASHION. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PROVIDERS TO HELP MANAGE THIS CONDITION AND PROBABLY MOST ALARMING. THIS IS NOT RARE. TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE KIND OF. PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AHEAD OF US WITH THIS CURRENTLY AS OF THIS WEEK- BEEN SEVENTY NINE MILLION COVER NINETEEN CASES IN THE UNITED STATES ALONE. HERE THE MAYO CLINIC JUST LIKE OUR FIRST PRESENTER WE ESTIMATE CONSERVATIVELY BASED ON THE RESEARCH CONSERVATIVELY ESTIMATE THAT TEN TO TWENTY PERCENT. OF INDIVIDUALS WITH COVER NINETEEN ARE GOING TO COME DOWN WITH LONG ALL COOL. SO THAT'S SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION PEOPLE. BASED ON OUR CLINIC EXPERIENCE AS WELL AS RESEARCH IS OUT THERE WE ANTICIPATE THAT 30% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WILL HAVE LONG TERM DIFFICULTIES GETTING BACK TO THEIR NORMAL WORK. AND THAT IS ROUGHLY TWO POINT THREE SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE OUT OF WORK DUE TO LOW HOW COOL IT FOR MANY MONTHS OR INDEFINITELY. SO THE CHALLENGE AHEAD OF US WITH LOCAL WHICH IS MORE THAN JUST A HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES A CHALLENGE FOR OUR SOCIETY. IN OUR ECONOMY AS A WHOLE. WITH THAT I WILL PAUSE AND- NEIL TO OUR NEXT PRESENTER. THANK YOU OUR DOCTOR SHOULDN'T SPEAK. WELCOME THANK YOU. I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT LONG COVE IT IT'S A TOPIC THAT I'VE BEEN RESEARCHING BIRTH FOR THERE IS EVEN A NAME TO PUT TO THE SENTENCE. NOW AS YOU HEARD HERE TODAY IT'S IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND THAT NOT EVERYONE HAS THE PRIVILEGE OR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE ABLE TO RETURN TO LIFE AS USUAL- CALIFORNIANS WHO ARE SUFFERING. MY NAME IS DR JENNIFER STEVENS THE ANIMAL DOUBLE BOARDED PREVENTIVE MEDICINE AND LIFESTYLE MEDICINE PHYSICIAN SERVING AS A DEPUTY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER FOR RIVERSIDE COUNTY. IT HAD MORE THAN WHERE WE'VE HAD MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CALLED NINETEEN RELATED THAT. I OVERSEE THE DIVISION OF INFECTIOUS DISEASE COMMUNITY HEALTH PLANNING AN EQUITY AND SERVE AS A MEDICAL ADVISER FOR A LOCAL COMPANY IN RESPONSE. I'M SPEAKING ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE ON LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. BEFORE JOINING RIVERSIDE COUNTY AROUND SIX MONTHS AGO I WORKED AT THE CDC AS AN EPIDEMIC INTELLIGENCE SERVICE OFFICER. OR IS DEPLOYED TO THE LATE TO QUALIFY OR POST KOBE CONDITION UNIT. IN THIS ROLE I WROTE THE CDC'S INTERIM GUIDANCE FOR HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS EVALUATING IN CARING FOR PATIENTS WITH POST ON THE CONDITIONS. MY FEEDBACK FROM THE-BODY POLITIC SURVIVOR CORPS AND THE PATIENT LED RESEARCH COLLABORATIVE. I'VE ALSO AUTHORED MULTIPLE PUBLICATIONS ON POST CODE CONDITIONS AREN'T LONG KOBE. AND HELP INFORM THE DECISION TO CONSIDER LONG CODE AS A DISABILITY AND TO CREATE. AN ICD CARCASS COMPETITION. WHAT TIME CALLED NINETY IS LOOKED AS A VIRUS THAT PEOPLE EITHER SURVIVE OR DIE FROM. THERE'S A LOT THAT FALLS IN BETWEEN. IT IS SHOWING THAT THERE ARE WIDESPREAD IMPACTS THE PHYSICAL HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND QUALITY OF LIFE. AND WHILE IT WAS ONCE THOUGHT THEY COULD NINETEEN WAS PRIMARILY A DISEASE OF THE LUNGS WE'VE COME TO LEARN THAT THE EFFECTS OF CARBON NINETEEN. ARE MUCH MORE WIDESPREAD. PEOPLE CAN. EXPERIENCE A VAST NUMBER OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF SYMPTOMS AS A BEEN DESCRIBED THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR AND- MANY OF THESE SYMPTOMS CAN BE DIFFICULT DIFFICULT TO DESCRIBE. AND STUDIES SUGGEST THAT LONG BECAUSE IT MAY BE MORE COMMON IN WOMEN. AND SO IT BECOMES EVEN MORE IMPORTANT FOR US TO PAUSE AND LISTEN TO THESE EXPERIENCES AND TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AS A STARKLY WE KNOW THAT WOMEN. PARTICULARLY WOMEN OF COLOR. HAVE UNFORTUNATELY EXPERIENCED MEDICAL RACISM AND SEXISM WHETHER SYMPTOMS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED. IMPORTANTLY JUST AS THERE BEEN DISPARITIES IN COMMON NINETEEN CASES IT'S INTOXICATED THAT SIMILAR DISPARITIES HAVE AND WILL EXIST FOR LONG BECAUSE OF IT. IT MEANS THAT OUR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE LIKELY TO EXPERIENCE HISTORICAL AND CURRENT DISPARITIES NOT RELATED TO KOBE. DISPARITIES RELATED TO Q. CODE NINETEEN AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT ALSO ADDITIONAL BURDEN OF LONG COMMENT. SOME OF THE KEY ACTIVITIES THAT HELP DEPARTMENTS HAVE DONE AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO IN ORDER TO PREVENT LONG COMMENTS. INCLUDE THE SAME ACTIVITIES THAT HELP PREVENT COMMON NINETEEN. THROUGHOUT THE PANDEMIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES TO PROVIDE VACCINATION TESTING NOVEL THERAPEUTICS. AS WELL AS GUIDANCE ON MASKING ISOLATION QUARANTINE VENTILATION HAND WASHING. WE KNOW THAT THESE STRATEGIES WORK AND WE STRIVE TO PROVIDE THESE PROGRAMS AND THIS GUIDANCE CENTERING ON WE IN OUR MISSION. MANY OF THESE ASPECTS ARE FOUNDED HIGHLIGHTED IN CALIFORNIA SMARTER BLACK. OTHER ACTIVITIES THAT COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS CAN AND HAVE DONE INVOLVED THE RULES EXPERT CONVENERS OF COMMUNITY PARTNERS AND RESOURCES THEY CAN USE THEIR COMMUNICATION PLATFORMS TO SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT LONG CODE ON THEIR WEBSITE EITHER DIRECTLY OR BY LINKING TO THE CDPH WEBSITE POST INFORMATION ON OUR SOCIAL MEDIA MEDIA PLATFORMS. AND SHARE INFORMATION ABOUT LOCAL POSTCODE CARE CLINICS DISABILITY BENEFITS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON FLEXIBLE WORK AND SCHOOL POLICIES. WITH SOME OF THIS GROUNDWORK HAS BEEN DONE HOW DEPARTMENTS CAN HELP SHARE AND BRING THIS INFORMATION TO THEIR TRUSTED COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS SCHOOLS EMPLOYERS AND OTHERS. LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE GREAT AT COMPETING GROUPS CONNECTING THE DOTS SHARING INFORMATION AND PARTNERING WITH THE COMMUNITY. SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC INITIATIVES THAT WE PARTNER ON HERE IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY INCLUDE CONDUCTING POST CODE FOLLOW UP CALLS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALLS. TO LEARN ABOUT THE LONG TERM EXPERIENCES THAT OUR RESIDENTS HAVE AFTER TESTING POSITIVE FOR COMMON NINETEEN. PARTNERING WITH MEMBERS OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN COLLABORATIVE ON BUILDING SUPPORT GROUPS WITH TRAUMA INFORMED APPROACHES. AND HOSTING TRAINING SESSIONS ON MY UNCLE BUT FAR FROM THE TOURISTS AND COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS HAVE BEEN INTEGRAL TRUSTED MESSENGERS THROUGHOUT THE COMMON NINETEEN RESPONSE. REACHING OUR LOT NEXT COMMUNITY INCLUDING MIGRANT AGRICULTURAL WORKERS. AND ACTUALLY IN OUR COUNTY WE PERSONALLY FELT THE EFFECTS OF LONG CALL THAT AS ONE OF OUR COMMON TORRES HAS EXPERIENCED ONGOING EFFECTS OF LONG CALLED IT. SUCH THAT SHE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO BACK OUT INTO THE FIELD AND CONTINUE DOING THE GREAT COMMUNITY WORK SHE HAS A MUCH PASSION FOR. THIS RIPPLE EFFECT CAN BE FELT THROUGHOUT THE COMMUNITY. YOU MUST CONTINUE TO BUILD STRATEGIES AROUND LONG COLD WINTER RECOVERY PLANS CENTERING EQUITY AT THE CORE OF THE STRATEGIES. WE MUST LEARN FROM LESSONS OF PASSOVER POST VIRAL CONDITIONS LIKE THE EXPERIENCES FROM POST POLIO WORK WEST NILE VIRUS. AS WELL AS SOME COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE LONG SUFFERED WITH CONDITIONS THAT ARE OFTEN DOWNPLAYED. LIKE THOSE EXPERIENCING ANY CFS OR MYALGIC ENCEPHALITIS AN IMPASSE. MORE STUDIES ARE NEEDED THAT'S THAT'S CERTAIN AND WE'LL IT'LL LIKELY TAKE TIME BEFORE CENTERS OF EXCELLENCE ARE ESTABLISHED. BUT IN THE MEANTIME WE NEED TO HELP THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING NOW. SO WHAT WITH YOUR SUPPORT FOR OUR STAFF AND PROGRAMS WE CAN PREVENT NEW CARBON NINETEEN CASES NOW WE CAN SHARE CURRENT BEST PRACTICES AND RESOURCES NOW. YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT WITH PLANNING AND BUDGETING FOR SERVICES TO HELP US GROW THESE INITIATIVES AND ACHIEVE THESE GOALS NOT ONLY FOR THE COMMUNITY. BUT WITH THE COMMUNITY. CALIFORNIA HAS A COMBINED AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE THE LEAD. HOW DO WE NEED TO CALIFORNIA. THE FRONT SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK SO VERY MUCH YOUR PRESENT- QUESTIONS COMMITTEE. OKAY ACTUALLY I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU BUT NOW BEFORE I ASK MY QUESTION IS WHERE COME IS THIS IS THE LAST PANEL I DO JUST WANT TO INVITE- THE PUBLIC WHO WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN PUBLIC COMMENT WE DO HAVE A HARD STOP TIME AT THREE THIRTY. TWO IF THEY WANT TO CALL IT NOW PLEASE DIAL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER. EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE FOUR ONE EIGHT FIVE. AND USE THE ACCESS CODE ONE TWO SIX FIVE TWO ONE EIGHT SO JUST ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE CALLING IN THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO DO THAT- SO- DOCTOR VANISH- THERE'S CONCERN E. MENTIONED- TO SERVE I GUESS YOUR ESTIMATE OF- ESSENTIALLY. TWENTY ROUND TWO TWO POINT FOUR MILLION. AMERICANS UNABLE TO WORK ATTENTION LEE- FROM LONG COATED. OUR OUR OUR POST CODED- INDEX AND AS YOU MENTIONED- I THINK WE'RE ABOUT SEVENTY NINE MILLION- KOBE CASES ALTHOUGH OF COURSE SOME PEOPLE SAY THAT'S FINE UNDER ESTIMATE- BUT I THINK. THE AT LEAST I'VE SEEN AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. BECAUSE I'M NOT- PROBABLY ROUGHLY A LITTLE UNDER HALF OF AMERICANS PRIDE HAD COATED- POTENTIALLY- AGAIN IT'S A BIT OF A GAS- WE KNOW THEY'RE SEVENTY NINE MILLION YOU ACTUALLY. REALLY STUCK IT CASES IDENTIFIED- THE ACTUAL NUMBER PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER- BUT- THAT ALSO MEANS. THE TAPE OUT HALF FOR A LITTLE OVER HALF. OVER HALF OF AMERICANS HAVEN'T. HAD BECAUSE OF IT- THIS LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS OF LONG COVE IN AND THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE HAVE A RANGE OF FREQUENCIES AND SO FORTH. WHAT YOU EAT IMAGE SHOULD WE BE WORKING HARDER THIS STOP TO PREVENT THE OTHER HALF FROM ACTUALLY ARE LITTLE OVER HALF FROM GETTING COLD IN THE FIRST PLACE I MEAN WE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. ALL THE SERVICES- FOR THEM WE NEED TO DO THAT THERE'S SO MANY PEOPLE RAVE GOTTEN COBIT OR A HALF BLOCK OF IT. WHAT YOU'LL BE DOING TO. IT YOU KNOW SOME PEOPLE SAID WELL HEY YOU KNOW WHAT'S IT'S OKAY PEOPLE CAN GET KIND OF IT AND- I WILL DEAL WITH IT LATER- BUT- WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME IN TERMS OF THE BURDEN. SHOULD WE BE WORKING HARDER TO TRY TO PREVENT THE CODED SO THAT WE DON'T KEEP ADDING TO THIS BURDEN OF LONG KERR. COVE IN. YES GREAT QUESTION THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I THINK THERE'S THREE MAIN. POINTS THERE THAT I COULD JUST TOUCH ON BRIEFLY FIRST YES THE NUMBERS THAT WE HAVE. FOR THESE ESTIMATES THEIR ESTIMATES DOES THAT. AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO MAY HAVE HAD KOBE. WHO DEMAND ACCESS OF TESTING ESPECIALLY EARLY ON THE PANDEMIC. YOU MAY BE EXPERIENCING THE SYMPTOMS AND ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS AND WE MAY NOT KNOW ABOUT THEM. WHEN IT COMES TO- THE NEXT WAVE HERE YOU'LL WHEN WE HAD- MORE CONCERTS A LOT OF PEOPLE TOOK SOLACE IN THAT THIS CONDITION WAS- OVER THIS PERIOD- TREATED INDIVIDUALS LESS SEVERELY BUT AS WE HAVE HEARD MULTIPLE TIMES OVER TODAY- LET. A SEVERE INFECTION IS NOT REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR SOMEONE TO HAVE. A LOCAL OF IT AND THIS IS OFTEN STILL VERY SURPRISING TO MANY INDIVIDUALS OUT THERE SO I THINK THAT. EDUCATION ABOUT WHO CAN GET LONGER WHO'S AT RISK FOR THIS AND HOW LONG YOU CAN REALLY LAST. IS SOMETHING ELSE THAT WE NEED TO FOCUS IN ON. AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALSO THE VACCINATION BY FAR THE BEST WAY TO NOT GET LOCAL BIT IS TO NOT GET CALLED IT IN THE FIRST PLACE. AND CONTINUING OUR EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE PROPERLY VACCINATED THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO THE RESEARCH. INTO THE PROPER VACCINES. ARE GONNA BE IMPORTED AS WE GO FORWARD. THANK YOU AN INDUCTION IN SKI ME A D. YOU KNOW YOU DESCRIBE YOUR BACKGROUND- OF COURSE YOU WERE YOU KNOW WORKING AT THE CDC BUT YOU'RE ALSO SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND- THE A LOCAL HELP. THE COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS WE DID HEAR FROM THE STATE ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'RE DOING. OR SOME OF THE THINGS THAT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE DOING AND WHAT THESE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NEED FROM THE STATE THAT YOU'RE SPEAKING TO. A STATE SENATORS HERE. WHAT DO YOU WHAT DO YOU NEED FOR- AS AS THIS COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND HEALTH OFFICERS. TO HELP. SUPPORT YOU IN. BOTH DEALING WITH LONG COVETED ADDRESSING LONG COVETED BUT ALSO PREVENTING LONG BECAUSE OF IT SO THAT WE DON'T KEEP ADDING TO THAT THE NUMBERS OF PEOPLE TALK OF IT. SHARKS WELL FROM OUR SIDE YOU KNOW AS WE HAD THROUGHOUT YOU KNOW OUR OUR TIME DEALING WITH A PANDEMIC WHERE WE'RE STILL WORKING ON VACCINES ARE STILL. YOU KNOW WORKING ON TESTING WE'RE STILL. WORKING ON THERAPEUTIC STAFF SUPPORT FOR THOSE ONGOING ACTIVITIES IS VITAL. AND WHAT THAT SUPPORT LOOKS LIKE THAT'S ALSO HELP WITH STAFFING SO WE'VE HAD SOME STAFFING CONCERNS OVER TIME. THE BUILDING UP OFF OF THE WORK FORCE AND HAVING FUNDING TO HELP DO THAT CAN REALLY HELP US TO. ACCOMPLISH OUR OUR ONGOING ACTIVITIES WITH THAT CODE RESPONSE. BUT THEN ALSO AS WE BRANCHED INTO- YOU KNOW NEWER ACTIVITIES AROUND LONG CALL THAT YOU- THERE ARE THERE ARE EFFORTS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE UNDERWAY AS AS I MENTIONED IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY. I'M A LOT OF THOSE FOCUSED AROUND THE EQUITY COMPONENT AND REACHING INTO OUR LOT NEXT COMMUNITY- AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. AMERICAN INDIAN COMMUNITIES- SO BEING ABLE TO HAVE THE STAFF AND HAVE THE RESOURCES TO BE ABLE TO EXPAND. OUR LONGER BUT AFTERWARDS. HELLO WE TRY TO MAKE THAT EVERYBODY'S THE COMMUNITY HAS THIS INFORMATION. INTO THE SCHOOLS INTO THE EMPLOYMENT SECTORS AND- AND MOST IMPORTANTLY INTO ON. THE AREAS THAT ARE OTHERWISE. I HAVE A LARGE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC BARRIERS. AND MAYBE TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU TALKED ABOUT EQUITY- AT TWO TWENTY THREE DO YOU THINK PERHAPS LONG COVE IT MAY BE UNDER DIAGNOSED AND TO ME IS A COLOR AND LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WE TALKED ABOUT IT'S HARD TO DEFINE- PEOPLE. WHAT WE TRY TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBERS AND I KNOW THAT THE DIRECTORS SERVE WIDE VARIATION BUT ALSO WE GET. LESS ACCESSIBLE WHETHER IT'S PRIVATE CARE DOCTORS. OF COURSE THAT MEANS EVEN LESS ACCESS TO MULTI DISPLAY TEAMS OF SPECIALISTS AND SO FORTH AND THEN OF COURSE THAT WE TALKED ABOUT LESS ACCESS TO TESTING AND OTHER TYPE THINGS AND THEN IF I WAS EVEN HAD CALLED IN THE FIRST PLACE- AND HOW OFTEN IT TURNS OUT SOMEONE MAY NOT BE NECESSARILY- HAVE YOU KNOW NOT HAVE A POSITIVE TEST AND STILL HAVE LONG CODE HE MAYBE SPEAK TO. WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO ENSURE THAT THERE WERE ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING- PEOPLE BLOCK OF IT WHO ARE ARE DEFINITELY WHAT THAT THE BURDEN OF LOCAL IT IS AND UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES. SURE I THINK AGAIN THAT DAY THAT GOES BACK TO SOME EDUCATION COMPONENTS AND THE REACH OUT INTO THE COMMUNITIES AND BEING ABLE TO FIND. OUR COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS ARE FAITH BASED ORGANIZATIONS THOSE THAT ARE TRUSTED MESSENGERS. AND BEING ABLE TO DELIVER. THIS INFORMATION. AND I CERTAINLY ANTICIPATE THAT WE'RE UNDER DIAGNOSING AND UNDER EVALUATING. THE AMOUNT OF LONG CODE THAT ARE IN THESE COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AND NOT PART OF THAT COMES FROM MY EXPERIENCE WITH TALKING WITH PEOPLE AND LEADERS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. AS WE WORK ON SOME OF THESE LONG CORPORATE EFFORTS. AND WHAT I'VE HEARD FROM SOME OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS. I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CONCENTRATE IN A REALLY LONG TIME I HAD CALLED IT. AND I'VE BEEN HAVING THIS THIS PROBLEM SINCE THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CONCENTRATE I'VE LOST MY MEMORY BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT IS. SO PEOPLE DON'T HAVE WORDS FOR IT THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY'RE EXPERIENCING THEY JUST KNOW THEY'RE SUFFERING. I THINK THAT'S WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE GET THIS INFORMATION OUT THERE- AND THAT WE'D FINALLY THROUGH ALL OF OUR- TRUSTED PARTNERSHIPS. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE SUFFERING AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT IT'S FROM. BOTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. BOTH THE DOCTOR- MANAGE KRISHAN AND- DOCUMENTS P.
