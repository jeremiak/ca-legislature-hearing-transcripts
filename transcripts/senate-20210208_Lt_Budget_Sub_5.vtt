HARDSHIP IN THE US ELECTED

AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:13:00.045 --> 00:13:01.180
FACING TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT

00:13:01.247 --> 00:13:02.848

WHICH WAS JUST OUTLINED BY THE

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:17.863
OTHER TWO CHAIRS. I DID A

00:13:17.930 --> 00:13:20.166
LITTLE BIT OF SIMPLE MATH THEIR

00:13:20.232 --> 00:13:21.467
HUNDRED FIFTY OPEN CASES BEING

00:13:21.534 --> 00:13:23.402
HANDLED BY MY STAFF CURRENTLY.

00:13:23.469 --> 00:13:25.304
IF THAT WERE THE CASE ON

00:13:25.371 --> 00:13:27.373
AVERAGE. OF FOR THE MEMBERS OF

00:13:27.439 --> 00:13:28.440
THE LEGISLATURE IN THE STATE OF

00:13:28.507 --> 00:13:30.943
CALIFORNIA THAT MEANS THERE'S

00:13:31.010 --> 00:13:31.677
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND CASES. THAT

00:13:31.744 --> 00:13:33.612
ARE BEING WORKED ON AND

00:13:33.679 --> 00:13:37.016
SUPPORTED BY FOLKS IN LOCAL

00:13:37.082 --> 00:13:39.084
GOVERNMENT OFFICES- ORDINARILY

00:13:39.151 --> 00:13:41.086
WOULD NOT. HANDLE THAT KIND OF

00:13:41.153 --> 00:13:43.155
WORKLOAD. AND DO NOT HAVE THE

00:13:43.222 --> 00:13:45.124
EXPERTISE TO DO SO THAT DOESN'T

00:13:45.191 --> 00:13:46.859
EVEN COUNT THE MAYORS AND

00:13:46.926 --> 00:13:47.893

00:13:53.432 --> 00:13:57.870
A BIG BIG ISSUE ALL CONTINUE TO

00:13:57.937 --> 00:13:58.504

00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.623

A HALF TO SIX YEARS. WHEN WE

ISSUED OUR AUDIT REPORT BACK IN

00:23:03.715 --> 00:23:05.383
MARCH OF TWENTY ELEVEN WE LOOK

RECESSION. THAT CALIFORNIA WAS

00:23:15.727 --> 00:23:18.363
SUFFERING FROM- SO WE MADE

00:23:18.430 --> 00:23:20.532
RECOMMENDATIONS TO EDT FOR

PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO REACH TO

00:23:29.441 --> 00:23:31.143

WITHOUT EVEN HAVING TO TALK TO

00:23:33.078 --> 00:23:35.380
AN AGENT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY ET

00:23:35.447 --> 00:23:36.581

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:40.085
PLAN BUT THEY HAVEN'T COMPLETED

00:23:40.152 --> 00:23:41.419
THAT PLAN WHEN THE WHEN THE

PANDEMIC CARE. AND ESSENTIALLY

00:23:43.822 --> 00:23:45.323
THEIR DRAFT PLAN WAS WAS. PUT

ON THE SHELF BECAUSE THEY HAVE

00:23:47.058 --> 00:23:48.393

00:23:48.460 --> 00:23:51.363
OF CLAIMS THAT CAME IN. EARLY

00:23:51.429 --> 00:23:52.697
TWENTY TWENTY SO THAT WAS ONE

00:23:52.764 --> 00:23:53.899
OF OUR FIRST CONCERNS THAT WE

00:23:53.965 --> 00:23:55.433

SO WE'RE NOT SAYING IT WOULD

00:24:25.697 --> 00:24:26.832
HAVE FIXED EVERYTHING THE

00:24:26.898 --> 00:24:28.400
PANDEMIC AS WE ALL KNOW IS

00:24:28.466 --> 00:24:30.235
UNPRECEDENTED BUT CERTAINLY IF

00:24:30.302 --> 00:24:31.336
THEY HAD IMPLEMENTED SOME OF

00:24:31.403 --> 00:24:32.838
THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND MADE

00:24:32.904 --> 00:24:33.405
SOME IMPROVEMENTS TO THEIR

00:24:33.471 --> 00:24:35.340
PROCESSES. THIS IS AND

00:24:35.407 --> 00:24:36.775
DIFFICULTIES THAT CALIFORNIANS

00:24:36.842 --> 00:24:39.544
HAVE BEEN FACING THIS LAST YEAR

00:24:39.611 --> 00:24:41.413
WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN AS SEVERE-

00:24:41.479 --> 00:24:43.515
SO THAT WAS THE FIRST KEY AREA

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:44.649
THE SECOND HERE IS REALLY

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.384
LOOKING AT THE CALL CENTER NOW

00:24:46.451 --> 00:24:48.220
EDT HAS STRUGGLED WITH THEIR

00:24:48.286 --> 00:24:50.121
CALL CENTER FOR YEARS. EVEN

00:24:50.188 --> 00:24:51.723
PREVIOUS TO THE PANDEMIC IT WAS

00:24:51.790 --> 00:24:53.692
VERY DIFFICULT FOR CALIFORNIANS

00:24:53.758 --> 00:24:55.861
TO GET THROUGH TO AN AGENT WHO

00:24:55.927 --> 00:24:57.829
CAN ASSIST THEM OVER THE PHONE

00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:59.297
SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS WE

00:24:59.364 --> 00:25:01.833
MADE IN THE PAST- WERE TO TRAIN

00:25:01.900 --> 00:25:03.768
THOSE AGENTS MORE QUICKLY BACK

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:05.337
WHEN WE CONDUCTED THE AUDIT TEN

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:08.106
YEARS AGO- IT TOOK ABOUT

00:25:08.173 --> 00:25:08.840
THIRTEEN MONTHS TO TRAIN. TRAIN

00:25:08.907 --> 00:25:10.809
SOMEONE THEY STREAMLINE

00:25:10.876 --> 00:25:12.811
STREAMLINE THAT DOWN TO ABOUT

00:25:12.878 --> 00:25:14.579
NINE MONTHS UNDER THE PANDEMIC

00:25:14.646 --> 00:25:15.947
BUT THAT'S STILL A LONG PERIOD

00:25:16.014 --> 00:25:17.282
OF TIME WHEN YOU HIRE SOMEONE

00:25:17.349 --> 00:25:18.650
AND YOU NEED TO TRAIN THEM FOR

00:25:18.717 --> 00:25:20.385
NINE MONTHS BEFORE THEY CAN BE

OUR CALLERS THAT GET IN. BUT

00:25:24.689 --> 00:25:25.857
THE BIG ISSUE WITH THE CALL

00:25:25.924 --> 00:25:27.359
CENTERS PEOPLE EVEN BEING ABLE

00:25:27.425 --> 00:25:29.895

00:25:29.961 --> 00:25:32.430

00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:36.601
BEST PRACTICES THAT ARE OUT

00:25:36.668 --> 00:25:37.969
THERE THAT SOME OF WHICH WE

00:25:38.036 --> 00:25:39.137

PUTTING TOGETHER A FREQUENTLY

00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:57.756
ASKED QUESTION- SEGMENT ON YOUR

00:25:57.822 --> 00:25:59.324
WEBSITE SO THAT AN INDIVIDUAL

00:25:59.391 --> 00:26:00.625
COULD GO TO THE WEBSITE RATHER

00:26:00.692 --> 00:26:02.027
THAN HAVING TO TRY TO GET INTO

00:26:02.093 --> 00:26:03.328
THE CALL CENTER THEY GET THEIR

00:26:03.395 --> 00:26:04.963

ANSWER I DON'T EVEN NEED TO TRY

AND CALL SOMEONE SO THOSE ARE

00:26:12.904 --> 00:26:14.673
SOME OF THAT THE BEST PRACTICES

00:26:14.739 --> 00:26:16.241
THAT WE SUGGESTED YEARS AGO.

00:26:16.308 --> 00:26:17.976
EDT IS STILL NOT DOING THAT

00:26:18.043 --> 00:26:21.780
THEY'RE NOT TRACKING. WHY

00:26:21.846 --> 00:26:22.380
PEOPLE ARE CALLING THEY'RE NOT

00:26:22.447 --> 00:26:23.014

BEST. WHICH IS FIRST CALL

00:26:25.083 --> 00:26:27.218
RESOLUTION HOW OFTEN IS THAT

00:26:27.285 --> 00:26:28.753
AGENT'S ABLE TO RESOLVE THE

00:26:28.820 --> 00:26:30.221
QUESTION OR THE IN THE ISSUE

00:26:30.288 --> 00:26:32.190
THAT PARTICULAR CALLER HAS. SO

00:26:32.257 --> 00:26:33.992
THAT PERSON'S CLAIM CAN

00:26:34.059 --> 00:26:35.560
CONTINUE TO GET PROCESSED AND

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:37.095
THEN EVENTUALLY THAT PERSON

00:26:37.162 --> 00:26:38.596
GETS THEIR BENEFITS. SO THAT'S

00:26:38.663 --> 00:26:39.664
AN INDUSTRY STANDARD THAT WE'RE

00:26:39.731 --> 00:26:45.971

00:26:46.037 --> 00:26:47.539

STILL WERE USING A LOT OF

00:26:53.945 --> 00:26:56.648
MANUAL PROCESSES. NEARLY HALF

00:26:56.715 --> 00:26:57.749
OF THE CLAIMS THAT CAME IN FOR

00:26:59.417 --> 00:27:01.419
MONTHS. HAD TO BE PROCESSED

00:27:01.486 --> 00:27:02.787

DEALT WITH. WITHIN AUTOMATION

00:27:06.491 --> 00:27:08.960
AUTOMATED SYSTEM. SO A LOT OF

00:27:09.027 --> 00:27:11.329
PEOPLE HAD TO. HAVE TO WAIT FOR

00:27:11.396 --> 00:27:12.831

INITIAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS. ARE

00:27:14.933 --> 00:27:17.469

INDIVIDUAL'S IDENTITY AND

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:35.787
MOVING THAT CLAIM FURTHER DOWN.

00:27:35.854 --> 00:27:37.155

HAVE IDEA ME AND THAT'S

00:28:35.046 --> 00:28:36.281
SOMETHING MAYBE THEY SHOULD

CONTINUE TO USE. AND CONTINUE

00:28:38.817 --> 00:28:40.118
TO HAVE THAT AS PART OF THEIR

00:28:40.185 --> 00:28:41.553
AUTOMATION BUT THERE ARE OTHER

00:28:41.619 --> 00:28:42.754
THINGS THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING

00:28:42.821 --> 00:28:44.089
TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO DO

00:28:44.155 --> 00:28:45.890
LIKE THE EXAMPLE I JUST GAVE.

00:28:45.957 --> 00:28:46.891

00:28:46.958 --> 00:28:49.094
THEIR PROCESSES AND SEE ONE OF

00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:50.595

FIVE OR SIX YEARS- THAT'S THE

00:29:01.339 --> 00:29:03.441
TYPICAL CYCLE THAT WE SAW WHEN

00:29:03.508 --> 00:29:05.176
WE LOOK AT RESEARCH SO THERE

00:29:05.243 --> 00:29:06.478

00:29:10.648 --> 00:29:11.382
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF OTHER

00:29:11.449 --> 00:29:12.250
THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO

MILLION CLAIMANTS. ARE TO THE

00:31:03.428 --> 00:31:04.996
TUNE OF ABOUT FIVE POINT FIVE

BILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PAID

00:31:11.135 --> 00:31:12.804
SITUATION WHERE SOME OF THESE

INDIVIDUALS AND WE HAD AN

00:31:14.272 --> 00:31:15.773

00:31:53.711 --> 00:31:54.779
HYPOTHETICAL WE USE IN THE

THAT MONEY BACK. SO FOUR KEY

00:32:14.432 --> 00:32:15.700
ISSUES IN THE FIRST AUDIT

00:32:15.767 --> 00:32:17.001
REPORT THAT WE ISSUE. THE

00:32:17.068 --> 00:32:18.569
SECOND OUR REPORT WE SHOULD

00:32:18.636 --> 00:32:21.072
FOCUS ON FRAUD. DETECTION

00:32:21.139 --> 00:32:22.740
PREVENTION AND CETERA AND AS

00:32:22.807 --> 00:32:25.109
YOU'VE HEARD FROM EDT- YOU KNOW

00:32:25.176 --> 00:32:26.878
THEY HAD A- A PRESS CONFERENCE

00:32:26.944 --> 00:32:29.147

00:32:29.213 --> 00:32:31.149
BILLION OUR AUDIT REPORT TALKED

00:32:31.215 --> 00:32:32.517
ABOUT TEN POINT FOUR BILLION

00:32:32.583 --> 00:32:34.719
DOLLARS. FROM MARCH THROUGH

00:32:34.786 --> 00:32:36.854
DECEMBER EDIE'S NUMBER WAS ARE

00:32:36.921 --> 00:32:39.657
CONTINUING ON INTO JANUARY. WE

00:32:39.724 --> 00:32:41.526
SEE IT. EXPLAINED THAT THESE

00:32:41.592 --> 00:32:43.127
ARE POTENTIALLY FRAUDULENT I

00:32:43.194 --> 00:32:45.229
THINK EDT CAN EXPLAIN I THINK

00:32:45.296 --> 00:32:46.097
THEY BELIEVE IT'S ALL

00:32:46.164 --> 00:32:48.132
FRAUDULENT PAYMENTS UP TO THE

00:32:48.199 --> 00:32:49.500
ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. WE SAID

00:32:49.567 --> 00:32:50.501
POTENTIALLY AT THIS POINT

00:32:50.568 --> 00:32:52.303
BECAUSE HE REALLY HASN'T BEEN

00:32:52.370 --> 00:32:55.073
ABLE TO GO IN. AND PROCESS LOOK

00:32:55.139 --> 00:32:55.973
AT ALL OF THOSE CLAIMS THAT

00:32:56.040 --> 00:32:58.209
WERE PAID OUR EITHER UNDER AN

00:32:58.276 --> 00:33:00.011
UNCONFIRMED IDENTITY A

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:02.347
SUSPICIOUS ADDRESS ARE THE

00:33:02.413 --> 00:33:03.348
EXAMPLES WE HAVE IN THE AUDIT

00:33:03.414 --> 00:33:06.150
REPORT- SO WE DON'T KNOW WE

00:33:06.217 --> 00:33:07.418
CERTAINLY KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE

00:33:07.485 --> 00:33:09.420
IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. IT

00:33:09.487 --> 00:33:10.588
WE FELT THAT THAT NUMBER WOULD

00:33:10.655 --> 00:33:12.390
GROW AFTER WE ISSUED OUR RIGHT

00:33:12.457 --> 00:33:14.158
ARE COMPLETED OUR FIELD WORK IN

00:33:14.225 --> 00:33:15.593
DECEMBER AND THEN ISSUED A

00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:17.028
REPORT IN JANUARY. AND

00:33:17.095 --> 00:33:18.930
CERTAINLY EDT HAS COME UP WITH

00:33:18.996 --> 00:33:20.164
A MORE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER

00:33:20.231 --> 00:33:22.533
HIGHER NUMBER THAN THAN WE HAD

00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:23.267
IN OUR REPORT WHICH DOESN'T

00:33:23.334 --> 00:33:25.536
SURPRISE US- BECAUSE I THINK

00:33:25.603 --> 00:33:31.476
THE KEY ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT.

00:33:31.542 --> 00:33:32.143
UNCONFIRMED IDENTITIES- WELL

00:33:32.210 --> 00:33:33.277
AWARE OF THE SIX. WHERE MY-

00:33:33.344 --> 00:33:34.412
MAILINGS GOING TO SUSPEND

00:33:34.479 --> 00:33:36.481
ADDRESSES SOME INDIVIDUALS ARE

00:33:36.547 --> 00:33:39.717
RECEIVING TWENTY THIRTY- EDT

00:33:39.784 --> 00:33:41.886
CORRESPONDENTS IN THE MAIL AND

00:33:41.953 --> 00:33:42.854
NONE OF THESE INDIVIDUALS LIVE

00:33:42.920 --> 00:33:44.188
AT THIS ADRESS. TRYING TO

00:33:44.255 --> 00:33:45.323
FIGURE OUT WHAT DO I DO WITH

00:33:45.390 --> 00:33:47.358
ALL THIS GET BACK TO EDT SUCKS

00:33:47.425 --> 00:33:49.827
ET DIDN'T SUSPEND OR TAKE

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:52.897
ACTION. UNTIL FAIRLY FAR INTO

00:33:52.964 --> 00:33:54.766
THE- PANDEMIC THEIR FIRST.

00:33:54.832 --> 00:33:57.335
ATTEMPT TO TRY TO PREVENT FRAUD

00:33:57.402 --> 00:33:58.903
WAS IN JULY AND THAT WAS THE

00:33:58.970 --> 00:34:00.805
SUSPICIOUS IDENTITIES AND-

00:34:00.872 --> 00:34:02.273
UNCONFIRMED IDENTITIES AND THEY

00:34:02.340 --> 00:34:04.242
PUT SOME STOP PAYMENT. CONTROLS

00:34:04.308 --> 00:34:05.510
AND THEN IT WASN'T UNTIL

00:34:05.576 --> 00:34:08.246
SEPTEMBER- WHERE THEY STARTED

00:34:08.312 --> 00:34:10.114
HOUSE STOPPING PAYMENTS OUT TO

00:34:10.181 --> 00:34:11.849
SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES WHERE

00:34:11.916 --> 00:34:15.987
MULTIPLE- CLAIM INFORMATION OR

00:34:16.053 --> 00:34:17.755
CLAIM. BENEFITS FOR BEING SENT

00:34:17.822 --> 00:34:19.323
TO THE SAME ADDRESS OR AN

00:34:19.390 --> 00:34:20.625
ADDRESS IT SEEMS VERY

00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:22.193
SUSPICIOUS. SO THAT WAS THE

00:34:22.260 --> 00:34:24.896
FIRST ISSUE. IN THE FRAUD

00:34:24.962 --> 00:34:27.598
REPORT THE SECOND ISSUE WAS A

00:34:27.665 --> 00:34:29.534
COUPLE OF HIGH PROFILE

00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.302
SITUATIONS THAT EDT WAS NOT

00:34:31.369 --> 00:34:33.771
PREPARED FOR- AND DIDN'T HANDLE

00:34:33.838 --> 00:34:35.606
AS WELL AS THEY SHOULD HAVE THE

00:34:35.673 --> 00:34:38.176
FIRST IS RELATED TO THE FROZEN

00:34:38.242 --> 00:34:38.810
ACCOUNTS WORKING WITH BANK OF

00:34:38.876 --> 00:34:41.012
AMERICA. AS WE DISCUSSED IN THE

00:34:41.078 --> 00:34:42.313
REPORT THERE WAS A LOT OF BACK

00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:43.614
AND FORTH BETWEEN BANK OF

00:34:43.681 --> 00:34:45.950
AMERICA AND ET DE- BUT EDT

00:34:46.017 --> 00:34:48.052
DIRECTED BANK OF AMERICA TO

00:34:48.119 --> 00:34:50.221
FREEZE THREE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR

00:34:50.288 --> 00:34:51.055
THOUSAND ACCOUNTS. NOW THERE

00:34:51.122 --> 00:34:52.490
IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO HAVE

00:34:52.557 --> 00:34:53.991
THOSE KINDS OF COMMUNICATION IN

00:34:54.058 --> 00:34:55.493
COORDINATION WITH WOULD BE A

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:57.161
NAY IT WASN'T AS GOOD AS IT

00:34:57.228 --> 00:34:58.863
SHOULD HAVE BEEN AND THE AND

00:34:58.930 --> 00:35:00.064
THE KEY ISSUE THAT WE REALLY

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:02.099
HAD A PROBLEM WITH. OUR IS WHEN

00:35:02.166 --> 00:35:04.001
HE DIRECTED BANK OF AMERICA TO

00:35:04.068 --> 00:35:06.370
FREEZE THOSE THREE HUNDRED

00:35:06.437 --> 00:35:07.004
FORTY FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS IT

00:35:07.071 --> 00:35:09.707
DIDN'T HAVE A PLAN OR A METHOD

00:35:09.774 --> 00:35:11.609
OR APPROACH IT WAS GOING TO USE

00:35:11.676 --> 00:35:13.110
TO ASSESS ALL OF THOSE ACCOUNTS

00:35:13.177 --> 00:35:14.479
AND DETERMINE WHICH ONES WERE

00:35:14.545 --> 00:35:16.614
REALLY LEGITIMATE CLAIMANTS.%

00:35:16.681 --> 00:35:19.450
AND UNFREEZE THOSE ACCOUNTS AS

00:35:19.517 --> 00:35:20.384
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND WHEN

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:21.752
WE COMPLETED OUR FIELD WORK IN

00:35:21.819 --> 00:35:24.055
DECEMBER WE HAD DETERMINED THAT

00:35:24.121 --> 00:35:25.857
ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED OUT

00:35:25.923 --> 00:35:27.358
OF THOSE THREE HUNDRED FORTY

00:35:27.425 --> 00:35:27.959
FOUR THOUSAND ACCOUNTS. HAVE

00:35:28.025 --> 00:35:29.827
BEEN UNFROZEN SO THEY WORK

00:35:29.894 --> 00:35:31.329
ATTENTIVELY A LOT OF LEGITIMATE

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:33.130
CLAIMANTS. WITH FROZEN

00:35:33.197 --> 00:35:35.867
ACCOUNTS- THAT EDT HAD NOT

00:35:35.933 --> 00:35:37.468
REVIEWED AND HAD NOT INFORMED

00:35:37.535 --> 00:35:39.937
SB A- TO. UNFREEZE SO THOSE

00:35:40.004 --> 00:35:41.873
CLAIMANTS. STATEMENT COULD GAIN

00:35:41.939 --> 00:35:44.041
ACCESS TO THEIR BENEFITS. THE

00:35:44.108 --> 00:35:45.209
SECOND KEY ISSUE IS THE

00:35:45.276 --> 00:35:47.545
INCARCERATION DATA- THIS IS

00:35:47.612 --> 00:35:49.280
WHERE EDT WASN'T CROSS

00:35:49.347 --> 00:35:52.350
MATCHING. OUR CLAIMS COMING IN

00:35:52.416 --> 00:35:54.685
WITH INCARCERATION DATA FROM

00:35:54.752 --> 00:35:57.588
CDC ARE AND CERTAINLY FROM OUT

00:35:57.655 --> 00:35:59.757
LOCAL. INDIVIDUALS INCARCERATED

00:35:59.824 --> 00:36:01.592
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL OR

00:36:01.659 --> 00:36:02.360
POTENTIALLY INCARCERATED OUT OF

00:36:02.426 --> 00:36:04.462
STATE. SO WE DIDN'T SEE THAT

00:36:04.529 --> 00:36:06.364
CROSS MATCHING EVEN THOUGH WHEN

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:08.065
WE DID SOME RESEARCH WE SAW

00:36:08.132 --> 00:36:10.001
THAT BACK IN TWENTY SIXTEEN.

00:36:10.067 --> 00:36:11.469
THERE WERE THIRTY FIVE STATES

00:36:11.536 --> 00:36:12.870
DOING THIS TYPE OF CROSS

00:36:12.937 --> 00:36:14.272
MATCHING AND IT'S A VERY

00:36:14.338 --> 00:36:16.507
VALUABLE TOOL. ON TO PREVENT

00:36:16.574 --> 00:36:21.045
FRAUD. EDT WASN'T DOING THAT-

00:36:21.112 --> 00:36:23.180
AND WHEN THEY DECIDED THEY WANT

00:36:23.247 --> 00:36:24.448
TO DO NEEDED TO DO THAT YOU

00:36:24.515 --> 00:36:26.484
KNOW YOU'RE WELL AWARE THAT THE

00:36:26.551 --> 00:36:28.419
DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S IF YOU LOOK

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:30.321
ISSUED A LETTER. SAYING THERE

00:36:30.388 --> 00:36:32.290
ARE MILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF

00:36:32.356 --> 00:36:35.626
DOLLARS POTENTIALLY- GOING OUT

00:36:35.693 --> 00:36:36.894
TO INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS OR

00:36:36.961 --> 00:36:39.096
ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXPANDING

00:36:39.163 --> 00:36:40.498
CAR STRAIGHT INDIVIDUALS AND

00:36:40.565 --> 00:36:42.300
CARCERI INDIVIDUALS IDENTITY

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:44.335
MAY HAVE BEEN STOLEN. OR IT MAY

00:36:44.402 --> 00:36:46.137
BE AN INDIVIDUAL WHO WAS

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:49.006
SEEKING AND ULTIMATELY ABLE TO

00:36:49.073 --> 00:36:52.577
GET BENEFITS- WE LOOKED AT THE

00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:53.878
INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED TO

00:36:53.945 --> 00:36:55.913
PUT TOGETHER THEIR ESTIMATES

00:36:55.980 --> 00:36:57.448
ONCE THEY WERE ABLE TO START

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:58.849
CROSS MATCHING AND THE REASON

00:36:58.916 --> 00:37:01.118
THEY WERE ABLE TO DO SO. IS THE

00:37:01.185 --> 00:37:03.020
ATTORNEY GENERAL HAD TO STEP IN

00:37:03.087 --> 00:37:05.356
AND ESSENTIALLY AUTHORIZED THE

00:37:05.423 --> 00:37:06.190
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS TO

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:08.259
SHARE INCARCERATION DATA

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:09.760
INFORMATION I NEEDED HE WOULD

00:37:09.827 --> 00:37:11.195
NEED TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:37:11.262 --> 00:37:13.264
CROSS MATCHING. THE OTHER STEP

00:37:13.331 --> 00:37:14.765
THAT HE TOOK WAS THEY ENTERED

00:37:14.832 --> 00:37:16.300
INTO A CONTRACT WITH A PRIVATE

00:37:16.367 --> 00:37:18.169
VENDOR WHO HAD ACCESS TO

00:37:18.235 --> 00:37:19.770
INFORMATION ABOUT INCARCERATED

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:21.973
INDIVIDUALS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:37:22.039 --> 00:37:23.908
AND CERTAINLY OUT OF STATE. SO

00:37:23.975 --> 00:37:25.242
THAT WAS AN IMPROVEMENT

00:37:25.309 --> 00:37:26.844
UNFORTUNATELY AGAIN IT CAME

00:37:26.911 --> 00:37:28.813
LATE IN THE PANDEMIC- IS

00:37:28.879 --> 00:37:30.514
SOMETHING THAT EDT HAS KNOWN

00:37:30.581 --> 00:37:32.483
ABOUT FOR A WHILE THEY HAD BEEN

00:37:32.550 --> 00:37:33.718
INFORMING THE LEGISLATURE

00:37:33.784 --> 00:37:36.187
OVERTIME IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN

00:37:36.253 --> 00:37:37.154
TWENTY NINETEEN AND AGAIN IN

00:37:37.221 --> 00:37:38.756
TWENTY TWENTY. IT WAS SOMETHING

00:37:38.823 --> 00:37:40.825
THAT EDT WAS LOOKING TO DO- BUT

00:37:40.891 --> 00:37:42.893
NEVER REALLY MOVED FORWARD AND

00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:45.262
GOT IT DONE AND TILL LATE IN

00:37:45.329 --> 00:37:46.998
TWENTY TWENTY. WHERE THEY WERE

00:37:47.064 --> 00:37:48.532
ABLE TO GET THE INCARCERATION

00:37:48.599 --> 00:37:50.468
DATA FROM CDC ARE ENTERED INTO

00:37:50.534 --> 00:37:52.303
THAT CONTRACT AND THE ESTIMATES

00:37:52.370 --> 00:37:53.971
THEY GAVE US WHICH WE INCLUDING

00:37:54.038 --> 00:37:55.039
THE OUR REPORT WE LOOK AT THEIR

00:37:55.106 --> 00:37:56.774
ESTIMATES. ABOUT EIGHT HUNDRED

00:37:56.841 --> 00:37:58.809
AND TEN MILLION DOLLARS OF

00:37:58.876 --> 00:38:00.578
CLAIMS ASSOCIATED WITH

00:38:00.645 --> 00:38:02.647
INDIVIDUAL AND INCARCERATED

00:38:02.713 --> 00:38:04.949
INDIVIDUALS. SO THAT THAT WAS

00:38:05.016 --> 00:38:09.954
THE SECOND KEY. ISSUE IN THE

00:38:10.021 --> 00:38:10.721
FRAUD AUDIT REPORT. THE THIRD

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:11.522
KEY ISSUE JUST LOOK AT THIS. IN

00:38:11.589 --> 00:38:14.458
THE AND THE- HOW EASY IS

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:16.127
COORDINATING WITHIN THE

00:38:16.193 --> 00:38:18.229
DEPARTMENT- AS FAR AS

00:38:18.295 --> 00:38:20.364
PREVENTION DETECTION OF FRAUD.

00:38:20.431 --> 00:38:22.833
WE FOUND VERY DISJOINTED-

00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:24.068
SITUATION THERE ARE A LOT OF

00:38:24.135 --> 00:38:25.202
DIFFERENT UNITS WE ACTUALLY

00:38:25.269 --> 00:38:27.405
HAVE A GRAPHIC IN THE PACKET

00:38:27.471 --> 00:38:28.305
THAT WE PULLED OUT OF THE ART

00:38:28.372 --> 00:38:30.241
REPORT. NOT EXPECTING YOU TO

00:38:30.307 --> 00:38:32.343
LOOK AT IT BUT IT SHOWS. FOR

00:38:32.410 --> 00:38:33.344
FIVE DIFFERENT UNITS IN SOME

00:38:33.411 --> 00:38:35.246
UNITS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:38:35.312 --> 00:38:37.014
IDENTIFYING IDENTIFYING

00:38:37.081 --> 00:38:39.116
SUSPICIOUS CLAIMS FRAUDULENT

00:38:39.183 --> 00:38:40.651
POTENTIALLY FRAUGHT THEN THEY

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:42.319
HAVE TO NOTIFY A DIFFERENT UNIT

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:43.521
WE NEED TO STOP PAYMENT ON THIS

00:38:43.587 --> 00:38:44.955
PARTICULAR CLAIM. AND THERE

00:38:45.022 --> 00:38:47.224
WASN'T A LOT OF COLLABORATION

00:38:47.291 --> 00:38:48.125
COORDINATION IT'S VERY

00:38:48.192 --> 00:38:51.028
DIFFICULT. TO BE ABLE TO FOR ET

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:53.397
DE TO BE ABLE TO OVERSEE AND

00:38:53.464 --> 00:38:55.366
MAKE SURE OUR OUR FRAUD

00:38:55.433 --> 00:38:56.667
DETECTION AND PREVENTION

00:38:56.734 --> 00:38:58.436
EFFORTS WORKING EFFICIENTLY.

00:38:58.502 --> 00:38:59.570
BECAUSE THERE WERE SO MANY

00:38:59.637 --> 00:39:01.238
DIFFERENT UNITS RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:02.907
SO MANY DIFFERENT THINGS SO WE

00:39:02.973 --> 00:39:04.241
FEEL THEY NEED TO HAVE

00:39:04.308 --> 00:39:06.277
ESSENTIAL IN UMBRELLA UNIT A

00:39:06.343 --> 00:39:08.279
UNIT THAT'S RESPONSIBLE FOR

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:10.181
COORDINATING ALL THE DIFFERENT.

00:39:10.247 --> 00:39:11.882
ACTIVITIES OF THESE DIFFERENT

00:39:11.949 --> 00:39:15.152
UNITS WITHIN EIGHTY DAYS VERY

00:39:15.219 --> 00:39:16.020
DISJOINTED. THE OTHER THING

00:39:16.087 --> 00:39:17.855
THAT WE- TALK ABOUT IN THAT

00:39:17.922 --> 00:39:19.990
SECTION OF THE REPORT IS EDT

00:39:20.057 --> 00:39:22.093
NOT NECESSARILY ASSESSING THE

00:39:22.159 --> 00:39:24.128
AFFECTED EFFECTIVENESS OF THEIR

00:39:24.195 --> 00:39:25.563
FRAUD PREVENTION TOOLS AND

00:39:25.629 --> 00:39:27.198
DETECTION TOOLS. NOW THEY'RE

00:39:27.264 --> 00:39:28.299
REQUIRED TO REPORT TO THE

00:39:28.365 --> 00:39:30.334
LEGISLATURE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS

00:39:30.401 --> 00:39:32.203
ABOUT FRAUD. BUT NOT

00:39:32.269 --> 00:39:34.872
NECESSARILY REQUIRED TO ANALYZE

00:39:34.939 --> 00:39:36.807
THEIR TOOLS AND THEN REPORT OUT

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.476
HOW EFFECTIVE THOSE TOOLS HAVE

00:39:38.542 --> 00:39:40.077
BEEN IN DETECTING AND

00:39:40.144 --> 00:39:42.213
PREVENTING FRAUD. SO WE HAVE

00:39:42.279 --> 00:39:43.514
SOME RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO

00:39:43.581 --> 00:39:45.449
THAT BUT THAT WAS THE THIRD KEY

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.151
ISSUE IN THE AUDIT REPORT THE

00:39:47.218 --> 00:39:48.419
SECOND ON A REPORT HAT WE

00:39:48.486 --> 00:39:50.221
ISSUE RELATED TO. FRAUD

00:39:50.287 --> 00:39:52.123
DETECTION AND PREVENTION. SO

00:39:52.189 --> 00:39:53.691
NOW MEMBERS I'LL TAKE YOU TO

00:39:53.758 --> 00:39:55.926
THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS ARE THAT

00:39:55.993 --> 00:39:57.228
WE MADE TO THE LEGISLATURE

00:39:57.294 --> 00:39:58.662
BECAUSE WE FELT SOME OF THESE

00:39:58.729 --> 00:40:00.631
ISSUES AS I INDICATED EARLIER

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:02.066
IN MY PRESENTATION. WE

00:40:02.133 --> 00:40:04.502
IDENTIFIED BACK IN MARCH OF

00:40:04.568 --> 00:40:05.302
TWENTY ELEVEN WE ISSUED OUR

00:40:05.369 --> 00:40:06.504
FIRST THOUGHT IT WE DID A

00:40:06.570 --> 00:40:08.672
FOLLOW UP ON IT NOVEMBER OF

00:40:08.739 --> 00:40:09.607
TWENTY TWELVE STILL SAW THERE

00:40:09.673 --> 00:40:11.308
WERE SOME. DIFFICULTIES THAT

00:40:11.375 --> 00:40:12.810
EDT WAS HAVING AND THEY WEREN'T

00:40:12.877 --> 00:40:14.011
MAKING ENOUGH PROGRESS IN

00:40:14.078 --> 00:40:15.846
IMPLEMENTING RECOMMENDATIONS SO

00:40:15.913 --> 00:40:17.948
WE THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE.

00:40:18.015 --> 00:40:19.884
SOME STATUTORY CHANGE AS CENTER

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:22.019
NIELSEN AND I KNOW MANY OTHERS

00:40:22.086 --> 00:40:24.421
HAVE EMBRACED THERE'S A LOT OF-

00:40:24.488 --> 00:40:25.890
LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED

00:40:25.956 --> 00:40:27.024
WELL LET ME STEP YOU THROUGH

00:40:27.091 --> 00:40:28.292
OUR KEY LEGISLATIVE

00:40:28.359 --> 00:40:29.994
RECOMMENDATIONS AND WHAT

00:40:30.060 --> 00:40:32.329
SUBJECT MATTER THEY TIED TO. SO

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:34.565
THE FIRST SET OF LEGISLATIVE

00:40:34.632 --> 00:40:37.735
RECOMMENDATIONS ARE TIED TO.

00:40:37.802 --> 00:40:39.904
THE RECESSION PLANNING SO EDT

00:40:39.970 --> 00:40:41.806
NEEDS TO HAVE A COMPREHENSIVE

00:40:41.872 --> 00:40:43.974
RECESSION PLAN AS I SAID. WE

00:40:44.041 --> 00:40:45.709
THE RESEARCH WE LOOKED AT SAYS

00:40:45.776 --> 00:40:47.444
IT RECESSION OCCURS EVERY FIVE

00:40:47.511 --> 00:40:48.946
AND A HALF TO SIX YEARS SO

00:40:49.013 --> 00:40:49.914
YOU'VE GOT TO HAVE A PLAN IN

00:40:49.980 --> 00:40:52.449
PLACE WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO-

00:40:52.516 --> 00:40:54.485
WITH REGARD TO STAFFING WITH

00:40:54.552 --> 00:40:55.820
REGARD TO SOME OF OUR

00:40:55.886 --> 00:40:57.888
PROCESSES. SO THAT WE CAN

00:40:57.955 --> 00:41:00.024
QUICKLY ADJUST TO A SURGEON

00:41:00.090 --> 00:41:03.561
CLAIMS WHEN WE ARE STARTING TO-

00:41:03.627 --> 00:41:04.795
EXPERIENCE A RECESSION IN

00:41:04.862 --> 00:41:07.264
CALIFORNIA SO THEY NEED TO HAVE

00:41:07.331 --> 00:41:09.099
THIS RECESSION PLAN IN PLACE SO

00:41:09.166 --> 00:41:10.201
THEY CAN PUT IT. PUT IT IN

00:41:10.267 --> 00:41:12.469
ACTION WANT TO BE ABLE TO

00:41:12.536 --> 00:41:15.840
RESPOND TO RESEARCH- AND

00:41:15.906 --> 00:41:16.774
UNFORTUNATELY PEOPLE BEING ON A

00:41:16.841 --> 00:41:18.475
AND- SAME THING IN DEALING WITH

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:20.044
STAFFING ISSUES PROCESSES

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.245
ETCETERA WE THINK THAT

00:41:21.312 --> 00:41:22.813
RECESSION PLAN NEEDS TO BE PUT

00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:25.616
IN PLACE. WITHIN A YEAR OF THE

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:27.218
LEGISLATURE ARE PASSING

00:41:27.284 --> 00:41:28.485
LEGISLATION IN THE GOVERNOR

00:41:28.552 --> 00:41:30.154
SIGNING IT AND THAT BILL BEING

00:41:30.221 --> 00:41:31.956
ENACTED INTO LAW. WHAT WE'RE

00:41:32.022 --> 00:41:33.290
GIVING EIGHTY TWELVE MONTHS

00:41:33.357 --> 00:41:34.391
AFTER THAT TO GET THAT

00:41:34.458 --> 00:41:36.260
RECESSION PLAN IN PLACE. THEN

00:41:36.327 --> 00:41:37.328
WHAT WE'RE SUGGESTING SHOULD

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:39.563
ALSO BE IN STATUTE IS EVERY

00:41:39.630 --> 00:41:40.631
THREE YEARS THEREAFTER THEY

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:42.867
NEED TO REASSESS THAT PLAN AND

00:41:42.933 --> 00:41:43.868
DETERMINE WHETHER NEED THEY

00:41:43.934 --> 00:41:45.369
NEED TO MAKE MODIFICATIONS TO

00:41:45.436 --> 00:41:48.272
THE PLAN. IT REALLY IS VERY

00:41:48.339 --> 00:41:48.839
IMPORTANT FOR EIGHTY TO HAVE

00:41:48.906 --> 00:41:51.141
THAT. THE OTHER ISSUE- THAT

00:41:51.208 --> 00:41:53.177
WE'RE RECOMMENDING LEGISLATURE

00:41:53.244 --> 00:41:54.812
REQUIRE EDT TO DO THIS IS

00:41:54.879 --> 00:41:57.214
REGARDING OVERPAYMENTS SO

00:41:57.281 --> 00:42:00.017
REQUIRE EDT TO POST ON ITS

00:42:00.084 --> 00:42:02.253
WEBSITE EVERY SIX MONTHS. OUR

00:42:02.319 --> 00:42:03.354
INFORMATION RELATED TO

00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.488
OVERPAYMENTS HOW MANY

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:05.256
OVERPAYMENTS HAVE THEY

00:42:05.322 --> 00:42:07.458
IDENTIFIED HOW MANY OF THOSE

00:42:07.524 --> 00:42:09.093
INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS HAVE THEY

00:42:09.159 --> 00:42:10.995
NOTIFIED THAT THEY HAVE BEEN

00:42:11.061 --> 00:42:11.762
OVERPAID AND THEY HAVE TO PAY

00:42:11.829 --> 00:42:13.697
THE MONEY BACK. HOW MUCH MONEY

00:42:13.764 --> 00:42:14.498
HAVE THEY RECOVERED FROM THOSE

00:42:14.565 --> 00:42:16.533
INDIVIDUALS HAVE THEY WAIVED

00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:18.502
ANY OF THOSE OVERPAYMENTS THERE

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:21.238
IS THE AUTHORITY. FOR EDT TO

00:42:21.305 --> 00:42:23.173
WAIVE OVERPAYMENTS I THINK IT'S

00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.209
ABOUT A TWO YEAR WINDOW. BUT

00:42:25.276 --> 00:42:26.810
THE CLAIMANT HAS TO SUBMIT A

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:28.445
HARDSHIP CLAIM AND CURRENTLY

00:42:28.512 --> 00:42:29.647
IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT

00:42:29.713 --> 00:42:31.515
PROCESS IS A MANUAL PROCESS SO

00:42:31.582 --> 00:42:34.018
AGAIN. THIS WILL BE ADDED ON TO

00:42:34.084 --> 00:42:36.520
THEIR EXISTING WORKLOAD. WHICH

00:42:36.587 --> 00:42:38.055
ALREADY IS DIFFICULT FOR THEM

00:42:38.122 --> 00:42:39.657
TO MANAGE I TALKED A LITTLE BIT

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:42.192
ABOUT. THE L. ELIGIBILITY

00:42:42.259 --> 00:42:43.494
DETERMINATION ISSUES FOR THOSE

00:42:43.560 --> 00:42:44.862
TOLD TWO POINT FOUR MILLION

00:42:44.929 --> 00:42:46.130
CLAIMANTS THEY HAVE TO DEAL

00:42:46.196 --> 00:42:47.564
WITH. THE ONE POINT SEVEN

00:42:47.631 --> 00:42:49.433
MILLION CLAIMANTS AS FAR AS THE

00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.734
CERTIFICATIONS THAT WERE

00:42:50.801 --> 00:42:54.004
DEFERRED OR SUSPENDED. NOW IN

00:42:54.071 --> 00:42:54.438
ADDITION TO THAT. IN

00:42:54.505 --> 00:42:56.173
COMBINATION THAT THEY'RE GOING

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.842
TO HAVE. I'M SURE INDIVIDUALS

00:42:58.909 --> 00:43:00.511
WHO SUBMIT HARDSHIP CLAIMS

00:43:00.577 --> 00:43:02.279
SAYING I CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY

00:43:02.346 --> 00:43:03.914
THIS MONEY BACK I ACTED IN GOOD

00:43:03.981 --> 00:43:06.016
FAITH PLEASE WAIT THE BENEFITS

00:43:06.083 --> 00:43:07.551
SO WE'RE SUGGESTING IN OUR

00:43:07.618 --> 00:43:08.719
LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:10.020
THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE REQUIRED

00:43:10.087 --> 00:43:11.555
TO DISCLOSE. ALL OF THIS

00:43:11.622 --> 00:43:13.657
INFORMATION ON ITS WEBSITE

00:43:13.724 --> 00:43:15.926
EVERY SIX MONTHS. THE NEXT

00:43:15.993 --> 00:43:18.462
ISSUE IS LESSONS LEARNED THEY

00:43:18.529 --> 00:43:19.263
NEED TO CONVENE A WORKING

00:43:19.330 --> 00:43:21.999
GROUP. TO REALLY REFLECT ON

00:43:22.066 --> 00:43:24.101
WHAT WORKS DURING THE PANDEMIC

00:43:24.168 --> 00:43:25.903
AND WHAT DID NOT WORK AND USE

00:43:25.970 --> 00:43:27.471
THOSE LESSONS LEARNED AS IT

00:43:27.538 --> 00:43:29.873
BUILDS ITS RECESSION PLAN- SO

00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:31.675
THAT CALIFORNIANS DON'T GO

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.277
THROUGH THIS AGAIN CLEARLY THE

00:43:33.344 --> 00:43:35.045
PANDEMIC'S UNPRECEDENTED. BUT

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.747
AS I'VE BEEN SAYING RECESSIONS

00:43:36.814 --> 00:43:37.948
ARE NOT UNPRECEDENTED BAY

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:40.184
COMMENTS THEY ARE CYCLICAL SO

00:43:40.250 --> 00:43:41.385
WE NEED TO HAVE THOSE LESSONS

00:43:41.452 --> 00:43:43.654
LEARNED MEMORIALIZED AND USED

00:43:43.721 --> 00:43:45.189
TO DEVELOP A BETTER ARE

00:43:45.255 --> 00:43:47.458
PLANNING IN THE FUTURE THAT

00:43:47.524 --> 00:43:49.326
RECESSION PLANNER REFERRED TO.

00:43:49.393 --> 00:43:50.894
THE NEXT ISSUES AGAIN ALL

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.229
LEGISLATIVE RECOMMENDATIONS

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:53.530
RELATED TO CROSS MATCHING

00:43:53.597 --> 00:43:56.266
REQUIRING ET DE IN STATUTE TO

01:14:25.727 --> 01:14:26.595
AMERICA WILL BE ABLE TO DISCUSS

01:14:26.662 --> 01:14:28.463
THAT. A LITTLE BIT FURTHER

01:14:28.530 --> 01:14:29.631
TODAY WE ALSO HAVE

01:14:29.698 --> 01:14:30.833
RECOMMENDATIONS THAT THEY NEED

01:14:30.899 --> 01:14:32.568
TO GET DONE BY MARCH THEY NEED

01:14:32.634 --> 01:14:34.636
TO GET DONE BY JUNE. SO WE WILL

01:14:34.703 --> 01:14:37.639
BE ABLE TO HAVE IN REAL TIME

01:14:37.706 --> 01:14:38.941
INFORMATION FOR THE

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:40.976
LEGISLATURE. TO EXERCISE ITS

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:42.911
OVERSIGHT AS IT'S DOING TODAY

01:14:42.978 --> 01:14:44.179
AND FOR THE PUBLIC TO

01:14:44.246 --> 01:14:46.315
UNDERSTAND YES SPEEDY IS MAKING

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:48.884
PROGRESS OR NO THEY'RE NOT- SO

01:14:48.951 --> 01:14:51.086
THAT WE AGAIN. YEAH WITH ALL

01:14:51.153 --> 01:14:52.321

01:14:52.387 --> 01:14:53.288
PRESSURE ON UNITY LET'S GET

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:54.022
SOME OF THESE THINGS

01:14:54.089 --> 01:14:55.958
IMPLEMENTED- I THINK THE

01:14:56.024 --> 01:14:57.025
ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO

01:14:57.092 --> 01:14:58.994
THAT WE HAVE A GOOD WORKING

01:14:59.061 --> 01:14:59.528
RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NEW

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:02.431
DIRECTOR- AND WITH THE NEW.

01:15:02.497 --> 01:15:04.566
MANAGEMENT TEAM AT EDG BUT

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.468
CERTAINLY WE NEED TO SEE SOME

01:15:06.535 --> 01:15:09.504
SOME CHANGE HAPPENING AT EDG

01:15:09.571 --> 01:15:10.873
WITH RESPECT TO THE LEGISLATIVE

01:15:10.939 --> 01:15:12.507
RECOMMENDATIONS FROM TWENTY

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.710
ELEVEN. OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:15.844
I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT

01:15:15.911 --> 01:15:17.112
QUESTION I DON'T KNOW IT LOOKS

01:15:17.179 --> 01:15:18.313
LIKE MY STAFF DON'T HAVE THE

01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:19.448
ANSWER WE CAN GET THAT BACK TO

01:15:19.514 --> 01:15:21.650
THE COMMITTEE. BUT CERTAINLY-

01:15:21.717 --> 01:15:23.919
WE FELT THAT SOME OF THEISSUES

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:25.487
WE IDENTIFIED IN OUR REPORT

01:15:25.554 --> 01:15:31.159
BACK IN MARCH OF. TWENTY ELEVEN

01:15:31.226 --> 01:15:31.693
RELATED TO THE CALL CENTER

01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:32.327
RELATED CLAIMS PRESS ASSISTING.

01:15:32.394 --> 01:15:34.129
MANY OF THOSE RED. WERE TO. AT

01:15:34.196 --> 01:15:34.863
THEY DIDN'T GET A- THEY DIDN'T

01:15:34.930 --> 01:15:36.064
GET THE RECESSED PLAN IN PLACE

01:15:36.131 --> 01:15:37.099
EVEN THOUGH THEY STARTED

01:15:37.165 --> 01:15:39.601
WORKING ON ONE. SO THAT'S WHY

01:15:39.668 --> 01:15:41.603
WE FELT THERE WERE A LOT OF.

01:15:41.670 --> 01:15:43.605
THINGS THAT EDT NEEDS TO DO

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:45.173
THAT WE FELT IT WAS REALLY

01:15:45.240 --> 01:15:47.442
INCUMBENT UPON THE LEGISLATURE

01:15:47.509 --> 01:15:48.210
TO GET THESE REQUIREMENTS IN

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:51.213
STATUTE. SO THAT EDT

01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:53.215
UNDERSTANDS THE SIGNIFICANCE OF

01:15:53.282 --> 01:15:54.650
THIS- AND IT ALLOWS THE

01:15:54.716 --> 01:15:56.618
LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE THAT

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:58.020
ADDITIONAL OVERSIGHT THAT

01:15:58.086 --> 01:16:01.023
ADDITIONAL- YOU KNOW. DIRECTION

TO THE ADMINISTRATION THAT

01:16:02.824 --> 01:16:04.493
THESE ELEMENTS ARE REALLY

01:16:04.559 --> 01:16:05.694
IMPORTANT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:07.396
TO HAVE A RECESSION PLAN. LET'S

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:09.097
NOT KEEP TALKING ABOUT CROSS

01:16:09.164 --> 01:16:10.165
MATCHING WITH INCARCERATED

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.199
INDIVIDUALS WITH BEEN HEARING

01:16:11.266 --> 01:16:12.534

01:16:12.601 --> 01:16:14.236
YEARS. LET'S GET IT DONE WE

01:16:14.303 --> 01:16:15.437
WANT YOU TO REPORT TO THE

01:16:15.504 --> 01:16:17.940
LEGISLATURE- ON HOW EFFECTIVE

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.841
THAT CROSS MATCHING IS WORKING

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.343
HOW EFFECTIVE THOSE TOOLS ARE

01:16:21.410 --> 01:16:22.511
WORKING THEIR REQUIRED

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.546
CURRENTLY REPORTS YOU ANNUALLY.

01:16:24.613 --> 01:16:25.847
ON FRAUD AND WHAT THEY'VE

01:16:25.914 --> 01:16:27.049
ACCOMPLISHED BUT NOT

01:16:27.115 --> 01:16:29.117
NECESSARILY ANALYTICS AS FAR

01:16:29.184 --> 01:16:30.886
AS- WHICH TOOLS ARE WORKING

01:16:30.953 --> 01:16:32.621
BEST. ARE THEY DOING ACROSS

01:16:32.688 --> 01:16:34.856
MANAGING HOW MUCH FRAUD HAS

01:16:34.923 --> 01:16:36.925
THAT PREVENTED. THOSE SORTS OF

01:16:36.992 --> 01:16:37.926
THINGS THAT WE THINK THAT

01:16:37.993 --> 01:16:39.294
RECOMMENDATIONS IN THESE TWO

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:43.432
REPORTS ARE VERY STRONG. WE'VE

01:16:43.498 --> 01:16:44.032
ALREADY SEEN THE LEGISLATURE.

01:16:44.099 --> 01:16:46.201
INTRODUCING NUMEROUS BILLS

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:47.069
WE'VE BEEN GOING THROUGH THE

01:16:47.135 --> 01:16:48.837
ANALYSIS THOSE BILLS A LOT OF

01:16:48.904 --> 01:16:50.539
THOSE BILLS INCLUDE INFORMATION

01:16:50.605 --> 01:16:52.174
FROM ANOTHER AUDIT WE DID LAST

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:55.711

AND DOCUMENTS- AS YOU MAY KNOW

01:16:59.514 --> 01:17:01.650
WE ISSUED A REPORT IN MARCH OF

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:02.451
TWENTY NINETEEN ON THAT ISSUE

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.653
WHERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER BAKER

SAYING I DON'T WANT MY FULL

SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBER ON A

01:17:10.592 --> 01:17:12.027
DOCUMENT COMING TO ME BECAUSE

01:17:12.094 --> 01:17:13.662
OF THAT DOCUMENT ENDS UP GOING

01:17:13.729 --> 01:17:15.831
TO A DIFFERENT. LOCATION THAN

01:17:15.897 --> 01:17:17.132
MY IDENTITY IS POTENTIALLY

01:17:17.199 --> 01:17:19.768
STOLEN AS YOU SAR OR HEARD

01:17:19.835 --> 01:17:21.737

01:17:24.706 --> 01:17:25.474
DOCUMENTS COMING OUT TO THE

01:17:25.540 --> 01:17:27.242
SUSPICIOUS ADDRESSES OR

INDIVIDUALS WHO NEVER FILED FOR

UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE GETTING

ALL OF THESE DOCUMENTS AT THEIR

01:17:32.748 --> 01:17:34.449
PARTICULAR ADDRESS. IT'S REALLY

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:36.251
INCUMBENT ON EDG TO GET THESE

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:38.687
SSNS TRUNCATED OR TO USE A

01:17:38.754 --> 01:17:40.389
UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IS ONE OF OUR

01:17:40.455 --> 01:17:41.823
RECOMENDATIONS I KNOW THERE'S

01:17:41.890 --> 01:17:43.325
LEGISLATION DIRECTED AT THAT

01:17:43.392 --> 01:17:45.560
BECAUSE- WE DID FOLLOW UP WORK

01:17:45.627 --> 01:17:47.029
ON THAT MARCH TWENTY NINETEEN

01:17:47.095 --> 01:17:49.998
NOT IT. IN LATER IN THAT TWENTY

01:17:50.065 --> 01:17:50.632
TWENTY WE SHOULD REPORT

01:17:50.699 --> 01:17:52.868
NOVEMBER AND FOUND THE THREE

01:17:52.934 --> 01:17:57.305
KEY DOCUMENTS THAT HAD.

01:17:57.372 --> 01:17:58.640
MILLIONS OF- MILLIONS GOING TO

01:17:58.707 --> 01:18:00.442
END OF. STILL HAD THOSE FULL

01:18:00.509 --> 01:18:02.744
SSNS WE IDENTIFIED TEN

01:18:02.811 --> 01:18:04.379
DOCUMENTS ANALYZE AND THREE OF

01:18:04.446 --> 01:18:06.681
THEM WAS THE LION SHARE OF

01:18:06.748 --> 01:18:08.250
THOSE DOCUMENTS ARE GOING OUT

01:18:08.316 --> 01:18:09.785
SO IF THEY ADDRESS THOSE THREE.

01:18:09.851 --> 01:18:12.120
BE STRATEGIC EIGHTY ONE OF THE

01:18:12.187 --> 01:18:13.055
THINGS THAT I THINK IS VERY

01:18:13.121 --> 01:18:14.956
IMPORTANT FOR EDG TO GENDER

01:18:15.023 --> 01:18:16.425
STAND I THINK THEY DO THE

01:18:16.491 --> 01:18:17.392
LEGISLATURE THE PUBLIC

01:18:17.459 --> 01:18:19.428
UNDERSTAND EATING NEEDS TO DO A

01:18:19.494 --> 01:18:20.162
RISK ASSESSMENT THEY NEED TO

01:18:20.228 --> 01:18:23.098
UNDERSTAND. WHERE WE INVEST OUR

01:18:23.165 --> 01:18:24.433
RESOURCES WE'RE GONNA WE'RE

01:18:24.499 --> 01:18:27.069

01:18:30.605 --> 01:18:31.973
MILLION CLAIMANTS WERE THEIR

01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.542
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATIONS WERE

01:18:33.608 --> 01:18:34.810

MILLION ISSUES. YOU NEED TO DO

01:18:36.645 --> 01:18:37.879
ONE OF OUR RECOMMENDATIONS YOU

01:18:37.946 --> 01:18:40.582
DEEP DO A RISK ASSESSMENT. IT'S

01:18:40.649 --> 01:18:42.017
OUR ESTIMATE IS GOING TAKEN

01:18:42.084 --> 01:18:43.051
THREE MILLION HOURS TO GET

01:18:43.118 --> 01:18:43.819
THROUGH ALL THOSE TWELVE

01:18:43.885 --> 01:18:45.020
MILLION ISSUES THEY'RE GOING TO

01:18:45.087 --> 01:18:46.221
DO A RISK ASSESSMENT WHICH ONES

01:18:46.288 --> 01:18:47.789
OF THOSE ARE THE HIGHEST

01:18:47.856 --> 01:18:49.524
POTENTIAL FOR FRAUD. WHAT ARE

01:18:49.591 --> 01:18:51.093
THE TYPES OF CLAIMS TYPES OF

01:18:51.159 --> 01:18:52.727
ISSUES THAT WE'VE SEEN

01:18:52.794 --> 01:18:57.299
HISTORICALLY THAT RESULTED. IN

01:18:57.365 --> 01:18:58.233
A CLAIM BEING FRAUDULENT. DO

01:18:58.300 --> 01:18:59.000

IDENTIFIES IT WAS ABOUT A

01:48:38.445 --> 01:48:38.945

IDENTITY AND YOU KNOW WERE

01:48:43.183 --> 01:48:45.785
WERE- POTENTIALLY LEGITIMATE

01:48:45.852 --> 01:48:46.853
CLAIMANTS SO THERE ARE

01:48:46.920 --> 01:48:48.054

FROM EDT WILL ASSESS WHAT

THEY'RE TELLING US. WHY HAVE

THE STATUTORY AUTHORITY TO BE

WAIT TO GIVE AN AGENCY AN

01:49:07.274 --> 01:49:08.275
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPLEMENT

01:49:08.341 --> 01:49:10.377
RECOMMENDATIONS- WE CERTAINLY

01:49:10.443 --> 01:49:11.645
CAN PARTNER WITH THE

01:49:11.711 --> 01:49:12.445
LEGISLATURE OVER THE COURSE OF

01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:15.181
THE NEXT. NINE MONTHS WHERE.

01:49:15.248 --> 01:49:16.449
THE MAJORITY OF THE

01:49:16.516 --> 01:49:17.183
RECOMMENDATIONS NEED TO BE

01:49:17.250 --> 01:49:19.219
IMPLEMENTED. WITH RESPECT TO

01:49:19.286 --> 01:49:21.454
THE THREE YEAR- ASSESSMENT AS

01:49:21.521 --> 01:49:23.490
YOU INDICATED THAT IS REALLY

01:49:23.556 --> 01:49:25.225
RELATED TO THE RECESSION PLAN-

01:49:25.292 --> 01:49:26.192
THE FIRST PART OF THAT

01:49:26.259 --> 01:49:28.094
RECOMMENDATION IS. IF THE

01:49:28.161 --> 01:49:29.863
LEGISLATURE DOES PUT IN STATUTE

01:49:29.930 --> 01:49:31.431
THAT A RECESSION PLAN A

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.400
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN IS REQUIRED

01:49:33.466 --> 01:49:35.201
WE SUGGESTED CERTAIN ELEMENTS

01:49:35.268 --> 01:49:36.503
THAT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THAT

01:49:36.569 --> 01:49:37.671
PLAN LIKE. LOOKING AT YOUR

01:49:37.737 --> 01:49:39.005
PROCESS IS LOOKING AT YOUR

01:49:39.072 --> 01:49:41.541
STAFFING. TO ALLOW FLEXIBILITY

01:49:41.608 --> 01:49:43.777
TO RESPOND TO A SURGE IN THE

01:49:43.843 --> 01:49:46.346
EVENT WE'RE- IN A RECESSION.

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:47.380
BUT THEN EVERY THREE YEARS

01:49:47.447 --> 01:49:48.615
THEREAFTER THE REASON WE

01:49:48.682 --> 01:49:49.349
THOUGHT THREE YEARS WAS

01:49:49.416 --> 01:49:51.251
REASONABLE IS BECAUSE WHEN WE

01:49:51.318 --> 01:49:52.152
LOOKED AT THE CYCLE OF

01:49:52.218 --> 01:49:53.620
RECESSION IT'S FIVE AND A HALF

01:49:53.687 --> 01:49:56.022
TO SIX YEARS. THE OTHER ISSUE

01:49:56.089 --> 01:49:58.425
THAT YOU. ASKED ABOUT AS FAR AS

01:49:58.491 --> 01:49:59.426
YOU KNOW AN AUDITOR EMBEDDED IN

SECTOR SO I DON'T KNOW BUT I

01:50:07.767 --> 01:50:10.103
KNOW CERTAINLY PRIVATE SECTOR.

01:50:10.170 --> 01:50:11.538

BECAUSE I THOUGHT IT WAS GOING

02:13:25.030 --> 02:13:26.698

TRANSLATION HOWEVER. WE HAVE

02:37:05.649 --> 02:37:07.050
CONDUCTED AUDITS IN THE PAST

02:37:07.117 --> 02:37:11.088
