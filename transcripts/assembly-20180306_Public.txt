THE MOTION WAS DO PASSES AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS THE BILL PASSES. PASSAGE GRADUATION PICTURE. AND. MISTER VOEPEL. YOU'RE NEXT. YOU HEARING YOUR NECKS. BLOSSOM CERVANTES OUTSIDE TO. I WILL BE ITEM NUMBER EIGHT. A AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO FIREARMS UNSAFE HANDGUNS MAYBE GET. YES SIR. UP THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE WHICH. INCLUDED MANY LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES OVER EIGHTEEN OTHER LAW ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES AND WHAT THIS. ORIGINAL BILL OF ESSENTIALLY DID WAS ALLOW LAW ENFORCEMENT TO HAVE VARIOUS. WEAPONS THAT. WERE EXEMPT FROM CALIFORNIA LAW FOR UNSAFE HANDGUNS AS LONG AS THEY WERE TRAINED AND HANDLED PROPERLY. ONE OF THE ENTITIES THAT WAS LEFT OUT OF THE EIGHTEEN OTHER LAWN FIRST FORSMAN ENTITIES WAS. THE HARBOR PLEASE FOR SAN DIEGO AND LOS ANGELES I RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR NO HAN SAN DIEGO HARBOR PLEASE. TO INCLUDE THEM UNDER AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO WHICH IS A MINOR TECHNICAL CORRECTION. TO AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE. THANK YOU ORDER ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. A WHIP. A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. WHO? MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRATYLUS UNHAPPY FIREARMS POLICY COALITION. WE HAVE A NUMBER. BUDGET. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS THIS THE IDEA THAT FIREARMS THAT ARE SAFE IN INCOME. THE REST OF THE. ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO. EVERY DAY SERVICE. I AND THEN WE CREATED. ESPECIALLY BRANCHES OR. OVER FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT. ONCE AGAIN. THESE ARE FIREARMS THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED UNSAFE. WE WOULD NEVER ALLOW LONG. THE RIGHT IN A CAR THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED UNSAFE. WE WOULD NEVER ALLOW THEM TO SIT AT A DESK THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED UNSAFE. WE WOULD NEVER LET ME DO ANYTHING OR USE ANY EQUIPMENT THAT HAS BEEN DEEMED UNSAFE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YET THAT IS IN FACT EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE DOING WHAT WE'VE DONE HERE. THEN WITH AB TWENTY ONE SIXTY FIVE WE CREATED A WE CREATED A SECOND TIER OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WHICH BASICALLY SAID ONCE YOU HAVE THE FIREARM. YOU CAN NEVER SELL IT OR GET RID OF IT OR TRANSFERRED UNLESS YOU DO IT TO ANOTHER TIER TO OFFICER NOW HERE'S THE PROBLEM THAT THAT IS CREATED. IS RIGHT NOW YOU HAVE. FF BELLS OR OR PEOPLE WHO MOVED HANDLE THESE UP A PRIVATE PARTY TRANSFERS. WHO HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHERE THE TIER TWO OFFICER OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER WHEN THEY COME IN? THEY HAVE NO IDEA WHERE THEY OBTAIN THE FIRE HOW THEY OBTAIN THE FIREARM IF THEY GOT IT USING THEIR TWO YEAR TO EXEMPTION. WELL THEN THEY CAN'T PRIVATE PARTY TRANSFER TO ANYONE EXCEPT ANOTHER TIER TO OFFICER. BUT IF THEY GOT IT AS A PRIVATE CITIZEN PURCHASED IT FROM SOMEONE ELSE. AS A PRIVATE PARTY TRANSFER WITHIN THE COULD TRANSFER TO ANYBODY. SO DID THE THE CONCERN THAT YOU'VE CREATED HERE IS FIREARMS RETAILERS HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT THE FIREARM THAT THEY ARE TRANSFERRING IS BEING TRANSFERRED LEGALLY. THE OTHER ISSUE IS IS THAT IN TERMS OF DETERMINING WELL IS THIS A VALID OFFICERS DISAPPEAR TO OFFICE OR NOT YOU'VE ADDED ANOTHER BADGE. THAT NGUYEN LAUNCHED WITH THAT WHEN WHEN THE PERSON COMES IN THE SHOW THEIR BAD TO SAY I AM ABLE TO NOW TRAINS FOR THE SPIRAL. THEY HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA WHETHER OR NOT THERE TRANSIT THEIR THEIR LEGALLY TRANSFERRING A FIREARM BECAUSE THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE THE OUR ISSUE IS THAT NUMBER ONE WE SHOULD BE CREATING A DIFFERENT TIERS OF WHEN IT COMES TO WASTE A CONSTITUTIONAL ENUMERATED CIVIL RIGHTS AND THEN WHEN WE DO SO. BECAUSE YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA DOES WILL CALIFORNIA DOES WE OUGHT NOT BE PUTTING FIREARMS RETAILERS AT RISK SIMPLY FOR TRYING TO EXECUTE THEIR MINISTERIAL DUTIES IN IN. THE END THE TRANSFER FIREARMS WE BELIEVE THAT BY ADDING ONE MORE GROUP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OUT WE ARE FURTHER COMPLICATING THE ISSUE IS FOR THESE REASONS. THAT WE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE AND I'VE ALSO. WANTED TO MAKE SURE TO NOTE THAT THE. GUN OWNERS OF CALIFORNIA HAVE ASKED US TO EXPRESS THEIR OPPOSITION AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU SIR. ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. YES. LACKEY. YEAH DOT SPECIFICALLY UNDER THIS DEFINITION DO WE KNOW THAT. WHICH GUNS A HARBOR POLICE ARE TRYING TO ACQUIRE. IN A TOTALLY I UNDERSTAND THEY'RE INTERESTED IN SOME OF THE NEWER GLOCKS I BELIEVE THE GLOCK FIVE O'CLOCK SIX AND THEN ONCE THEY RETIRE OR NEED TO. UPGRADE AGAIN BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGY IS CONSTANTLY CHANGING. THEN THEY WANT TO BE ABLE TO SELL. WHEN I THINK IT. ANY OTHER QUESTION. OKAY I'M. SO THERE'D BE THAT THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDING AND I. AND AND. BASIC BECAUSE. THE D. INDIVIDUALS THAT WILL BE HANDLING. HAVE A HIGHER. PROFICIENCY THE DELIBERATE FIREARMS. SHE LACKEY PROBABLY CAN ATTEST TO THE TYPE OF TRAINING EVEN THE HARBOR POLICE AND POOR POLICE WHO. I ACTUALLY KNOW SEVERAL OFFICERS IN LA PORT. THEIR THEIR THEIR SKILLED WITH BEING ABLE TO HANDLE FIREARMS AND AS OFFICERS I WOULD. I BELIEVE IT. SINCE THEY ALSO ARE CHARGED WITH ARM ENSURING THAT THE WRONG WRONGFUL FARMS DON'T GET INTO INTEROPERATION THEY HAVE TO ENFORCE THAT. I WOULD BELIEVE THAT THEY WILL ALSO TAKE A HIGHER. SCRUTINY AS WITH THAT FIREARM GOES FROM PLACE TO PLACE TO PLACE AND SO. IT'S OBVIOUS WAS AN OVERSIGHT THAT WAS LEFT OUT THE HEART POLICE IMPORT POLICE HOLDING CHAIRS RECOMMEND AN AYE VOTE. LIVE RIGHT BESIDE ME EMOTION. SECOND. WE HAD A MOTION TO GET. UP CULTURAL. ON AB EIGHTEEN SEVENTY TWO THE MOTION IS TO PASS JONES SAWYER AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY I CARILLO.

AND. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY. AND WHAT EVER ONE YOU WANTED TO DO FIRST THREE AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX FIRST OR. A. B. EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY PRESENTING AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX THIS MORNING. FIRST OFF I WANT TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND I WANT TO THANK YOUR COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE ON THIS BILL. THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILLS TO EXPEDITE THE PROCESS OF PROSECUTING SERIAL FENCES OF SEXUAL BATTERY AND STATUTORY RAPE AND TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS. UNDER CURRENT LAW THE PROSECUTION OF CERTAIN CRIMES CAN BE CONSOLIDATED INTO A SINGLE TRIAL IF THE PERPETRATOR COMMITTED THEM ACROSS MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS. THE LIST OF ELIGIBLE CRIMES INCLUDE HUMAN TRAFFICKING DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND CHILD ABUSE HOWEVER THIS LIST DOES NOT INCLUDE SEXUAL BATTERY OR STATUTORY RAPE. THIS MEANS THAT A SURVIVOR WHO ADORED ONE OF THESE OFFENSES MAY BE FORCED TO TESTIFY A MULTIPLE TRIALS AND FORCED TO RELIVE THIS ORDEAL HERE SHE. EXPERIENCED THIS COULD BE VERY TRAUMATIC FOR VOTE OVER SURVIVORS ESPECIALLY CHILDREN. NOT ONLY THAT BUT UNDER CURRENT LAW UNDER. ARE UNDER RESOURCE JUSTICE SYSTEM IT WOULD BE FORCED TO GO THROUGH SEVERAL COSTLY AND TIME CONSULTANT RILES WHICH DELAYED THE PROSECUTION AND PUNISHMENT THESE PERPETRATORS. AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX MOVE THE BILL SOLVE THIS ISSUE BY ADDING SEXUAL BATTERING STATUTORY RAPE TO LESTER CRIMES HELLO JUBAL FOR CONSOLIDATION INTO SINGLE TRIAL. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY ON AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS JUDY TASK GROUP WHOSE HERE ON BEHALF OF THE SAN DIEGO. COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY SUMMER STOCKTON. YEAH. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M JUDY TASCHEN ARE FROM THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SAN DIEGO I WORK OUR SEX CRIMES AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING UNIT. AND I'M JUST HERE TODAY TO ADDRESS YOU ABOUT AB SEVENTEEN FORTY SIX IT'S A VERY SIMPLE LEGISLATIVE FIX TO OUR. SEX CRIMES JURISDICTIONAL JOINDER STATUTE AND WE'RE SIMPLY ASKING TO ADD TO COME TO THIS THING CRIMINAL. COME CODES THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY COVERED BY THE OPTIONAL ON JOINDER. AND THIS IS SIMPLY BE STATUTORY RAPE CHARGE AS WELL AS FELONY SEXUAL BATTERY AND I HAVE PERSONALLY SEEN THE TRAUMA THAT THESE VICTIMS EXPERIENCE WHEN THEY GO THROUGH THESE CRIMES. AND THEN HAVE TO TESTIFY IN COURT ABOUT THEM AND ALL WE'RE DOING IS GIVING THE OPTION OF INCLUDING THESE VICTIMS. IN THE OPTION OF JOINING THEIR CASES AND JOINING THEIR CHARGES WHEN THE PERPETRATOR COMMITS THESE CRIMES ACROSS JURISDICTIONAL LINES BECAUSE AS WE KNOW SEXUAL PERPETRATORS DON'T JUST COMMIT THEIR CRIMES AGAINST ONE VICTIM. OR IN THE SAME JURISDICTION THEY OFTEN CROSS JURISDICTIONAL COUNTIES. AND HAVE MULTIPLE VICTIMS AND SO THIS JUST GIVES THE OPTION OF ADDING THOSE CHARGES TO GATHER AND JOINING THEM IN THE SAME JURISDICTION. IF BOTH JURISDICTIONS AGREE. AND THEN THE JUDGE HAS TO AGREE TO SO YOU STILL GO THROUGH A HEARING WHERE THE JUDGE HAS TO APPROVE IT TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S FAIR TO ALL PARTIES. AND THAT THERE'S NO I'M IN THERE IS NO UNDUE PREJUDICE TO ANY PARTY SO THAT'S IT'S A VERY SIMPLE I'M ADDITION JUST TO INCLUDE THESE OTHER VICTIMS TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE PROTECTED. FROM HAVING TO TESTIFY MULTIPLE TIMES AND TO ENCOURAGE JUDICIAL EFFICIENCY AND TRYING THESE ALL AT ONCE. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO TODAY IN LATE JANUARY OF THIS YEAR A REGIONAL HUMAN TRAFFICKING TASK FORCE BASE OUT OF LOS ANGELES ARRESTED MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED HUMAN TRAFFICKING SUSPECTS IN A STING OPERATION. AS PART OF THE OPERATION LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS SET UP A DECOY ACCOUNT ON FACEBOOK AND OTHER ONLINE PLATFORMS WERE TAKEN ABACK BY THE AMOUNT OF TRAFFIC. THESE ACCOUNTS GENERATED AND IN AUGUST OF LAST YEAR AN ALERT AND. AMERICAN AIRLINES EMPLOYEE AT THE SACRAMENTO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT NOTICE CHIU TEENAGE GIRLS WITHOUT ID'S WERE TRYING TO BOARD A FLIGHT TO NEW YORK WITH NO RETURN FLIGHT. A BUT THE TEAMS WERE TOLD THEY WERE GOING TO BE PAID FOR MODELING AND BE MUSIC VIDEOS BY MAN THEY MET THEIR INSTAGRAM. THE SPECIFIC INCIDENCES POINT TO THE ALARMING TREND IN HUMAN TRAFFICKERS UP BY USING THE INTERNET AND SOCIAL MEDIA BY WHICH A POPULAR SITES SUCH AS FACEBOOK INSTAGRAM TO LOWER POTENTIAL VICTIMS TO THEM. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TO MAKE IT A FELONY TO CONTACT A MINOR WITH THE INTENT TO ENGAGE IN HUMAN TRAFFICKING THIS BILL WILL HELP LAW ENFORCEMENT COMBAT THE GROWING USE OF THE INTERNET BY HUMAN TRAFFICKERS. AND PROVIDE A PIECE OF THE PUZZLE THAT IS THAT THE SOLUTION TO CALIFORNIA'S HUMAN TRAFFICKING PROBLEM COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS A SPONSOR OF THE BILL. ASSISTANT ALAMEDA COUNTY DESCRIPTOR ANY CHARMIN BAKU'S AHEAD OF THE HUMAN TRAFFICKING UNIT. A GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME CHARMAINE BACH. I'VE BEEN WITH THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DE IS OFFICE FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS AND HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN COMBATING HUMAN TRAFFICKING. SINCE EARLY TWO THOUSAND. I WOULD URGE A VOTE FOR THIS BILL WHICH WOULD MAKE IT A CRIME FOR PERSONS TO CONTACT OR COMMUNICATE WITH THE MINOR WITH INTENT TO COMMIT HUMAN TRAFFICKING. AS YOU KNOW OUR OFFICE INDIAN NANCY O'MALLEY HAS BEEN IN THE FOREFRONT OF DESPITE. AND WE'VE LED THE NATIONAL EFFORT TO EDUCATE BRING AWARENESS THERE IS HOWEVER A GAP WITH REGARD TO. CONTACTING MINERS IN THE FOURTEEN TO WHEN YOU ARE IN A AND A PURCHASER SITUATION. WITH THE INTENT TO TRAFFIC THIS WOULD TARGET THAT EXACT AREA WE'VE SEEN A GROWING USE OF THE INTERNET NOW WITH THE INTENT TO LURE CHILDREN. OF WHO UNWITTINGLY FALL PREY. INTO A DESTRUCTIVE AN ASSAULTIVE SITUATION WHERE THIS EXPLOITATION AND ABUSE CAN OCCUR THIS BILL WOULD PROTECT OUR CHILDREN OUR MOST PRECIOUS RESOURCE. I FROM BEING LURED. BY PERPETRATORS FOR THEIR OWN SEXUAL GRATIFICATION. EXISTING LAW MAKES IT A CRIME FOR PERSONAGES THIS WITH THE INTENT TO COMMIT KIDNAPPED OR SEXUAL ASSAULT WE ARE MERELY ASKING THAT YOU PUT THE OBVIOUS INTO THAT STATUTE AS WELL. AND INCLUDE HUMAN TRAFFICKING. I ON BEHALF OF THE ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. BUT THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN RECURSOS ALONG BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THANK YOU. EITHER A WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CATHY SURE. KATHY SURE ON BEHALF OF THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR ADVOCACY AND POLICY. WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO BECAUSE IT UNNECESSARILY CREATES A NEW CRIME ADDRESSING BEHAVIOR THAT IS ALREADY CRIMINAL UNDER EXISTING LAW. PENAL CODE SECTION TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE PROVIDES THAT A PERSON WHO CAUSES INDUCES OR PERSUADES OR ATTEMPTS TO CAUSE INDUCE OR PERSUADE A MINOR. TO ENGAGE IN A COMMERCIAL SEX SEX ACT WITH THE INTENT TO AFFECT A VIOLATION OF SPECIFIED PROVISIONS IS GUILTY OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING. A DEFENDANT WHO COMMUNICATES WITH A MINOR IN AN ATTEMPT TO INDUCE THE MINOR TO ENGAGE IN A COMMERCIAL SEX ACT IS GUILTY OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING UNDER THIS PROVISION. A DEFENDANT WHO TOOK A DIRECT ACTION TOWARDS SUCH A COMMUNICATION BUT FAILED TO CARRY IT OUT. WOULD BE GUILTY OF ATTEMPTED HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE OPPOSE AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO BECAUSE IT WOULD UNNECESSARILY FURTHER COMPLICATE CALIFORNIA'S CRIMINAL LAWS AND DOES SO WITH NO SHOWING THAT IT WILL IN ANY WAY HELPED TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING WE URGE YOU KNOW FOR. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. THE COURT ARMED TO THE ALAMEDA ASSISTANT DA IT SEEMS TO ME THE ACLU MADE A CASE DOES THIS. HOW DOES THIS CHANGE CURRENT LAW WOULD INCREASE PENALTIES OR MAKE IT EASIER TO CONVICT? WHY IS IT THAT YOU WANT THIS CHANGE? BUT USE A MICROPHONE. IT APPROACHES THE. I WAS ONE OF THE CO AUTHORS ACTUALLY OF PROP THIRTY FIVE AND JOHN I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS LAW LOOKS AT IT FROM A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE THE PERSPECTIVE OF. I'D SAY A PURCHASER AS WELL. IN TERMS OF. TARGETING THOSE CHILDREN AS. SOMEWAY IS PURSUING. SOMEBODY IN THAT IT WHO IS A MINOR FOR THE PURPOSE OF PURCHASING SACKS. THAT IS NOT ADDRESSED IN TWO THIRTY SIX POINT ONE WHICH HAS THE INTENT OF SOMEONE BEING A PEN. AND THE TRAFFICKER. WELL WOULDN'T THIS PERSON ALREADY BE. GEN IN JEOPARDY FOR HAVING SEX WITH MINOR. WELL YOU KNOW IT'S A IT'S A PERSON WOULD BE IN JEOPARDY AS A SIX FORTY SEVEN BE WHICH IS A MISDEMEANOR. IN IN OUR STATE AND SO THIS LOOKS OUT IT AND PLACES IT INTO THE CONTEXT IN WHICH IT IS IT IS APPROPRIATELY PLACED. WE HAVE FOR EXAMPLE STATUTORY RAPE AND OTHER CRIMES WE HAVE TWO EIGHTY EIGHT A WITCHES WHEN YOU TOUCH SOMEBODY UNDER THE AGE OF FOURTEEN WITH THE LOOT INTENT. THOSE ARE ALL IN THIS CATEGORY BUT IF YOU'RE IN THE FOURTEEN TO SEVENTEEN RANGE THAT'S NOT COVERED. I JUST FIND IT DIFFICULT TO. VOTE FOR BILLS THAT. YOU NOW HE PENALTIES ON TOP OF PENALTIES SO I'LL BE ABSTAINING THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE ANY MORE QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. OKAY WITH THAT. YOU MAY CLOSE. COLLEAGUES I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE LET'S CLOSE THIS LOOPHOLE IN PROTECT MINERS. THE. AND I UNDERSTAND THE ACLU'S POINT UNDERSTAND. CORKS APPREHENSION ON THE CHAIR IS GOING TO RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE SO WE CAN MOVE THIS ALONG. MCCALL ROLE. AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TO THE MOTION AS YOU PASSED THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY AYE CARDIO. GALILEO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK NOT VOTING QUIRK NOT VOTING SANTIAGO. THE MEASURE PASSED. CUNNINGHAM. YOU HAVE TO MEASURES. ITEM NUMBER ONE AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE. AND OUR ITEM NUMBER TWO AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. MORNING MR CHAIRMAN VERSUS. I'LL TAKE WHICHEVER ONE THE CHAIR LIKES BETTER FIRST WITH AT ONE. WITH THAT BUT I THINK I KNOW WHICH ONE THAT IS. YEAH. AB SEVEN THIRTY AT THE SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE. IT'S NO SECRET. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THAT CALIFORNIA IS A. A. FIGHTING A BATTLE THAT IS REALLY A WORLDWIDE BATTLE AGAINST HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WE HAVE UNFORTUNATELY THE HIGHEST RATE PER CAPITA OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING INCIDENTS REPORTED SAYS MADE THE INDUSTRY'S A HUNDRED AND. FIFTY TWO HUNDRED EIGHTY BILLION DOLLAR WORLDWIDE INDUSTRY. WHAT I'M ATTEMPTING DO IN THIS BILL IN THE THE ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW? IS. STRENGTHEN OUR APPROACH TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN PARTICULAR AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE. SEEKS TO GIVE A TEN YEAR RESTRAINING ORDER FOR VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING. AND VICTIMS OF PANDERING THEIR OVER AGE EIGHTEEN. ALL RIGHT NOW UNDER CURRENT LAW YOU CAN GET YEAR PROTECTIVE ORDER IF. TO TO SAFEGUARD THE VICTIM AYE IT IF THE VICTIMS THE VICTIMS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. NOT THE CASE OF LABOR TRAFFICKING. THAT'S. THE DIST THE DISPARITY THEIR DOESN'T MAKE. A TON OF SENSE TO ME I THINK YOU STILL HAVE. A PSYCHOLOGICAL ELEMENT YOU SAW PEOPLE THEY'RE BEING ABUSED EXPLOITED FOR OTHER PEOPLE'S. PERSONAL FINANCIAL GAIN. TRAFFICKING IS TRAFFICKING IF YOU WILL. THAT TENURE PROTECTIVE ORDER IS AN IMPORTANT PIECE TO GIVE THAT VICTIM STABILITY. AND I CAN TELL YOU HAVING. BEEN A PROSECUTOR. THE SHORT RESTRAINING ORDERS ONE YEAR TO YEAR EVEN THREE YEARS. THERE'S A PSYCHOLOGY AT WORK IT'S SIMILAR ALMOST ANALOGOUS TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PEOPLE. AB AND REALLY BEEN. ABUSED PSYCHOLOGICALLY AND I CAN'T TELL YOU THE NUMBER OF CASES I PROSECUTE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WERE. YOU GIVE A SHORT RESTRAINING ORDER AND AFTER YEAR. THE VICTIMS COMING INTO COURT ARE TALKING TO THE DA'S OFFICE OR THE VICTIM ADVOCATE OFFICE SAYING HEY I WANT THIS RESTRAINT OR LIFTED. BECAUSE THAT PERSON THAT'S ABUSE THEM HAS I'VE GOTTEN. BACK IN TOUCH WITH THEM AND CONVINCE THEM TO TRY TO GET THE PROTECTION UNWOUND. THE TEN YEAR ORDER AND AND I GET A GIVES TIME FOR THAT VICTIM. TO LAUNCH A NEW LIFE. TO GET AWAY AND HAVE THE FULL PROTECTION OF THE STATE. TO GET AWAY FROM THE PERSON THAT'S. EXPLOITED THEM AND I THINK IT BE A POSITIVE STEP FOR VICTIMS OF TRAFFICKING. NOT JUST IN. WELL AND ALL ALL THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND WITH ME IS MISS JUDY TAPPED HER SAN DIEGO DE IS OFFICE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING AGAIN CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. JUDY CASHNER FROM THE SAN DIEGO DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. AND I THEM AGAIN THIS IS A VERY A SIMPLE A SIMPLE FIX TO INCLUDE GROUPS THAT HAVE BEEN EXCLUDED FROM THE OPTIONAL TENURE RESTRAINING ORDER. AND THAT'S ALL WE'RE SEEKING TO DO TODAY ON IS TO INCLUDE THESE BASIC GROUPS WHICH ARE THE ADULT VICTIMS OF PIMPING PANDERING. WHO ARE DESERVING AS OF MUCH PROTECTION AS THE MINERS THAT ARE BETTER PIMPIN PANDERED ON THESE ADULT VICTIMS JUST BECAUSE THEY TURN EIGHTEEN DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY'RE NOT WORTHY OF THAT PROTECTION? AND IT IS OPTIONAL IT'S DISCRETIONARY OF TO THE JUDGE. THEY NEED THE TIME TO GET AWAY FROM THEIR PIMPS AND AS WE KNOW FROM THESE CASES. THESE PANTS EVEN IF THEY'RE SENT TO PRISON% THEY OFTEN CONTINUE TO PIMP THEM FROM PRISON OR WHEN THEY GET OUT OF PRISON SO THAT TENURE ORDER WILL HELP PROTECT THEM TO GIVE THEM THAT SPACE TO BE ABLE TO GET AWAY. FROM THEIR ABUSER OR THEIR PAMPER EITHER TRAFFICKER. I AM ALSO INCLUDED IN THIS OR THE LABOR TRAFFICKING VICTIMS AND. I NOTICED THERE WAS AN OPPOSITION FILED REGARDING THOSE VICTIMS. BUT I DON'T KNOW WHY THEY'RE UNDESERVING OF THIS PROTECTION JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING ARE TRAFFICKED FOR NON SEXUAL PURPOSES THESE VICTIMS OF LABOR TRAFFICKING WHO ARE DAY. THEY'RE MOSTLY IMMIGRANTS THAT ARE WORKING IN THE U. S. ON TEMPORARY VISAS THEY WORK IN AGRICULTURE HOSPITALITY CONSTRUCTION RESTAURANTS. THEY'VE EXPERIENCED SOME TYPE OF FORCE FRAUD COERCION INCLUDING DOCUMENT FRAUD WITHHOLDING OF THEIR DOCUMENTS DISTORTION ABUSE DISCRIMINATION PSYCHOLOGICAL MANIPULATION. AND VIOLENCE AND THREATS AGAINST THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS. SO I'M NOT SURE WHY THEY SHOULDN'T BE INCLUDED IN THIS AS WELL JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT BEING TRAFFICKED ON FOR SEXUAL PURPOSES. SO THOSE ARE THESE THE SIMPLE ON REQUESTS FOR INCLUDING JUST THE SMALL GROUPS OF VICTIMS FOR THIS OPTIONAL PROTECTIVE ORDER FOR UP TO TEN YEARS. THANK YOU OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. GOOD MORNING LUCIA MUCH OR ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SHERIFFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT THINKING. JOHN KEPT KEY ON BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNITED OF CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. SHAWN HOP IN THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. JERRY MEMBERS JONATHON FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. RYAN SOME OF THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. MICHELLE THOMAS OUT ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN SUPPORT. OKAY ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING GANNAWAY. CAPTURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA'S CENTER FOR ADVOCACY AND POLICY WE RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE. UNDER PENAL CODE SECTION ONE THIRTY SIX POINT TO A CRIMINAL COURT HAS THE POWER TO EXTEND ITS JURISDICTION OVER A DEFENDANT FOR A PERIOD THAT MAY EXTEND. FAR LONGER THAN THE DEFENDANT'S SENTENCE OR TERM OF PROBATION BY IMPOSING AN ORDER RESTRAINING THE DEFENDANT FROM CONTACT WITH THE VICTIM FOR UP TO TEN YEARS. THESE ORDERS CAN HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON A DEFENDANT'S ABILITY TO RE INTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY. AS A DEFENDANT MAY RISK VIOLATING THE ORDER UNINTENTIONALLY IF HE RETURNS TO THE VICINITY WHERE THE VICTIM LIVES AND WHERE THE DEFENDANT'S FAMILY AND FRIENDS MAY ALSO LIVE. DURING THE TIME THE ORDER REMAINS IN EFFECT. THE DEFENDANT FACES POTENTIAL FURTHER PENALTIES INCLUDING TIME IN JAIL FOR A VIOLATION OF THE ORDER. BECAUSE THIS POWER IS SO EXPANSIVE THE CLASS OF CASES IN WHICH IT CAN BE EXERCISED IS NARROWLY DEFINED INCLUDING ONLY SPECIFIED DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES SPECIFIED SEX CRIMES AND GANG RELATED CRIMES. THESE CRIMES INVOLVE EITHER A PARTICULAR TYPE OF INTIMATE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DEFENDANT AND THE VICTIM AS WITH DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CRIMES AND BRIDGE REGISTRABLE SENSE OF SEX OFFENSES. OR IN THE CASE OF GANG RELATED CRIMES. SPECIFIC CONCERN ESTA RETRIBUTION AGAINST SOMEONE WHO TESTIFIES AGAINST THE DEFENDANT. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE PROPOSES TO EXTEND THE RESTRAINING ORDER POWER BEYOND THESE NARROW CATEGORIES OF CASES TO CASES INVOLVING HUMAN TRAFFICKING FOR PURPOSES OF LABOR OR SERVICES OR CAMPING OR PANDERING OF ATTEMPTING OR PANDERING OF AN ADULT. THE LEGISLATURE HAS FOUND THAT VICTIMS OF CERTAIN SEX CRIMES AND OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE MAY NEED PROTECTION. BEYOND WHAT IS PROVIDED THROUGH THE PROSECUTION AND SENTENCING OF THAT. BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE DEFENDANT'S IN THOSE PARTICULAR KINDS OF CASES. IN THESE CASES AND ONLY IN THESE CASES HAS THE RISKS TO DEFENDANT'S BEEN CONVERT THEIR RISK TO VICTIMS. BEEN CONSIDERED SO GREAT AS TO WARRANT THE EXTENSION OF THE COURT'S JURISDICTION OVER DEFENDANT POTENTIALLY FOR MANY YEARS AFTER THE END OF THE SAN. WITHOUT LEGISLATIVE RESTRAINT AS TO THE TYPES OF CRIMES FOR WHICH A RESTRAINING ORDER WITH. MAY BE ISSUED SECTION ONE THIRTY SIX POINT TWO WILL BECOME AN AVENUE FOR LINK THE CRIMINAL JURISDICTION OVER MORE AND MORE DEFENDANTS. SADLY THE END RESULT WILL BE MORE OFFENDERS. FACING FURTHER CRIMINAL PENALTIES FOR VIOLATIONS OF THESE ORDERS EVEN WHEN THERE HAS BEEN NO HARM TO THE VICTIM. WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE ON AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY. THANK YOU. ARE TO ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. OKAY RTA QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS YES GONZALEZ FLETCHER. SO I'M JUST I'M. CURIOUS. ARE CONCERNED I GUESS. I I'D HEARD EVERYTHING YOU SAID BUT I'M STILL HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING. WHAT THE CONCERN? FOR THE PERPETRATOR WHAT WHAT HARM IS BEING DONE BY THE BY SOMEBODY WHO LABOR TRAFFICKED SOMEBODY. WHAT WHAT IS YOUR CONCERN THAT THAT INDIVIDUAL WILL STILL BE UNDER THE PURVIEW OF THE COURT? YEAH. SO THEY WILL REMAIN UNDER THE JURISDICTION OF THE COURT FOR UP TO TEN YEARS UNDER ENSLAVING SOMEBODY. SO THEY'D ALREADY BEEN RECEIVED A CENT. WHICH MAY INCLUDE INCARCERATION IT MAY INCLUDE DETERMINE. PAROLE OR PROBATION. ON IT'S NOT THAT THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PUNISHED FOR THE CRIME WE THINK. THAT. FOR THAT FOR THAT TYPE OF CRIME AS OPPOSED TO A SEX CRIME OR DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CRIME. WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THE NEED TO GIVE THE COURT THIS ADDITIONAL POWER FOR AN ADDITIONAL KIND OF OF PUNISHMENT ENOUGH. FOR THAT EXTENDED OF APPEARING. OKAY THANK. THANK YOU. OPINION OF THE TO QUIRK. YEAH I'M I AGREE WITH THE A. IN THIS CASE. ARM YOU KNOW STICK IT TIP ACCORDING TO COMMITTEE OF TYPICAL. PENALTY IS EIGHT YEARS IN PRISON. I THINK AT THAT POINT. HOPEFULLY THE. WE HAVE TO GIVE THIS PERSON A CHANCE. TO REDEEM THEIR LIVES AND PREVENTING THEM FROM GOING BACK TO PERHAPS WHERE THERE HOME WAS PERHAPS WITH THEIR FAMILY WAS TO ME MAKES NO SENSE. AND IT IS MORE LIKELY TO CAUSE RECIDIVISM THEM TO PREVENT CRIME THEREFORE I WILL BE VOTING FOR THIS THANK YOU. ANY OTHER. COMMENT. MISTER CUNNINGHAM REMAINED CLOSE IF I COULD CLOSE MISTER CHAIR JUST ADDRESSING A FEW BRIEF POINTS WERE BROUGHT UP IN THE OPPOSITION THE FIRST. ON THE ISSUE OF AN UNINTENTIONAL VIOLATION OF. PROTECTIVE ORDER THAT JURY INSTRUCTION FOR THIS CRIME. WHICH THIS DOES NOT ALTER IN ANY WAY. A REQUIRES A WILLFUL VIOLATION YOU CANNOT GET PROSECUTED OR CHARGED WITH VIOLATING. WRITTEN OF PROTECTIVE ORDER FOR JUST HAPPENING TO BE IN A MOVIE THEATER WHERE THE PROTECTED PARTIES IN THE MOVIE THEATER. YOU HAVE TO KNOW THAT THE PERSON IS THERE AND COME WITHIN TYPICALLY FIFTY OR A HUNDRED YARDS OF THAT PERSON THAT RESIDENTS THAT'S THAT'S THE WAY THE LAW WORKS ON THE THING SIDE. THIS DOESN'T. CHANGE OUT I DON'T THINK IT WOULD PREVENT SOMEBODY FROM MOVING BACK MEAN WE DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES BUT. FOR THE CASE OF PEOPLE THAT WERE LABOR TRAFFICKED WE ALSO NEED TO GIVE THEM WHERE APPROPRIATE. AS SHE POINTED OUT IT'S AN OPTIONAL THING IT'S NOT AUTOMATIC IN EVERY CASE BUT WHERE THE JUDGE FINDS AN APPROPRIATE. FOR SOMEBODY WHO WAS ENSLAVED AND BROUGHT SOMETIMES BROUGHT TO THIS COUNTRY AGAINST THEIR WILL. AND IS IS EXPLOITED THEY NEED SOME TIME TO HEAL TO REBUILD THEIR LIVES TO GET BACK ON THEIR FEET AND TO KNOW. IF IT'S APPROPRIATE THAT FOR TEN YEARS THEY CANNOT BE CONTACTED BY THE PERSON THAT EXPLOIT. THAT'S ALWAYS SEEKING TO DO HERE I THINK IT'S A GOOD STEP FORWARD IN OUR COLLECTIVE FIGHT AGAINST THIS EPIDEMIC THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU AND. I DON'T KNOW SO DIFFICULT ONE. AND. WHAT GOT ME TO YES IS ONE JUDGE'S DISCRETION DOES NOT AN AUTOMATIC AT BECAUSE REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT IT IS EVEN MORE IMPORTANT? BUT FOR THE ACLU THEN. IMPROPER USE THAT BECAUSE EACH CASE IS IS DIFFERENT IS SEPARATE AND EACH ONE WRITTEN REQUIRES DIFFERENT. PUNISHMENT IN DIFFERENT. TERMS OF HOW YOU YOU MET THAT OUT BUT ALSO HOW YOU HELP VICTIM. AND ON THE VICTIM PART OUT I'M DOING A LOT OF WORK RIGHT NOW MORE TRAUMA INFORMED CARE. AND TRAUMA DOESN'T LAST A WEEK GOOD LAST YEAR BUT THE LAST TEN YEARS. I WILL SUBMIT TO YOU. FOR SOME OF US IT LASTED DECADES AND FOR SOME OF US TRAUMAS GONE FROM GENERATION TO GENERATION TO GENERATION. ON AND SOLD IT IS IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T READ. TRAUMATIZED VICTIMS LIKE LIKE I GET THAT AND I I GUESS THE LAST THING IS REALLY. AN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT BOMB. FROM THE PARTY OF THE OTHER SIDE DAT. DAT. IMMIGRANTS ARE BEING ABUSED IN WAYS THAT ARM. WE SHOULD KEEP THE FORMER EMPLOYER OR WHOMEVER IS DOING TO BE USER AWAY FROM THEM AND THAT IS A REAL THING. AND I'M GLAD THAT DHEA. THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE IS ACKNOWLEDGING THAT IN IN IN THIS BILL SO I'M RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY FIVE THE MOTION IS TO PASSED YOU APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. LACKEY AYE CARILLO. GODLY ALL AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK NOT QUIRK NOT VOTING SANTIAGO. THAT MEASURE PASSED. IF YOU. ITEM NUMBER TWO SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. MISTER CHAIRMAN VERSE SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN SEEKS TO SIMPLIFY WHAT IS SORT OF AN OLD STATUTE THAT'S BEEN RECOGNIZING CASE LAWS BEING UNNECESSARILY COMPLICATED THE. CURRENT DEFINITION AND PENAL CODE TO SIXTY SIX AYE. OF ESSENTIALLY THE CRIME OF PANDERING. HAS SIX SUBPARTS. IT'S GOT A LOT OF PAIN AMBIGUOUS LANGUAGE JUST GOT A LOT A BROAD LANGUAGE IN SUBSECTION SIX INCLUDES THE WORD. ATTEMPT AND THE MINUTE THAT YOU PUT THE WORD ATTEMPT IN THE STATUTE. YOU'RE EXPANDING ITS ITS AMBIT. TREMENDOUSLY SO WHAT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO WITH THIS BILL IS. COLLAPSE THE STATUE INTO A SINGLE DEFINITION OF PANDERING THAT. ACCURATELY DESCRIBES USING THE RIGHT VERBS ALL OF THE CONDUCT THAT COMPRISES. PANDERING IS SIMPLY RECRUIT ENOUGH SOMEBODY INTO THE SEX TRADE. SO. WITH THAT I WOULD. OFFERS SHAUN HOPPING WITH THE DA'S OFFICE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT AND TAKE ANY QUESTIONS ANYBODY ELSE. MR HOFFMAN MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SHAUN OFTEN WITH CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION HERE IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN. AS HE SOME WOMEN SAID THE OBJECT OF THE OF THE BILL IS REALLY TO SIMPLIFY THE PANDERING STATUTE. INTO ONE SUBPARAGRAPH THAT BORROWS LANGUAGE FROM THE EXISTING CASE LAW HAVE OVER A HUNDRED YEARS OF CASE LAW ON THIS STATUTE. TO ADOPT THE MEANING THAT THE COURTS HAVE PLACED ON A STATUTE. WITHOUT MAKING SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES. THEM THE ANALYSIS MENTIONS THE EXISTENCE OF A JURY INSTRUCTION IN CAL CRAM. ELEVEN FIFTY ONE AS A REASON WHY THE BILL MAY BE UNNECESSARY. IF YOU LOOK AT THE USE NOTES OF THAT SAME JURY INSTRUCTION THE. DRAFTERS OF OF CAL CRAM NOTE THAT THE STATUTORY UNDER THE STATUTORY LANGUAGE PROCURE MAY BE A DIFFICULT VERB FOR. JURORS UNDERSTAND IN THE WAY THAT IT'S BEEN INTERPRETED BY COURTS OVER THE LAST CENTURY. IN OF THEIR CONCERNS THAT THERE ARE ELEMENTS. POSSIBLY BEING DELETED I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE INTENT AND I'M SURE THAT THE THE AUTHOR AND CERTAINLY. THE FOLKS CAME UP THE LANGUAGE WOULD BE. WILLING TO TAKE COMMITMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE NOT LESSENING THE BURDEN WE'RE NOT CHANGING THE MEANING OF THE STATUTE WERE STICKING TO THE CASE LAW BUT BUT SIMPLIFYING WHAT'S ON THE BOOKS. AS AS THAT HAS EVOLVED OVER THE LAST HUNDRED YEARS SO FOR THOSE REASONS WERE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DON CAB KIAM BEHALF OF CRIME VICTIMS UNIT OF CALIFORNIANS. YEAH. GEN MEMBERS JONATHAN FELDMAN CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. AS CHAIR RYAN CHAIRMAN THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION SUPPORT. ALAMEDA COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. I GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. NICK BROKE OUT A SECOND ADVOCATES HERE ON. YOU HAVE TO CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. I WILL SEE PDA REPPERT APPRECIATES THE WANT TENSION EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR TO PROPER VENN INDIVIDUALS FROM ENFORCING THE PROSTITUTION. REGRETFULLY MUST OPPOSE COUPLE REASONS UNDERSCORING OUR OPPOSITION TO THIS ONE. NUMBER ONE CPA AGREES WITH THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHEN IT STATES OF THIS BILL AND I QUOTE CARRIES A POTENTIAL FOR OVER BREATH WHICH WOULD RESULT IN CRIMINALIZING CONDUCT BEYOND WHAT HAS BEEN. TRADITIONALLY TREATED AS PANDERING. AT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS. BY REMOVING THE REQUIREMENTS OF FORCE OR THREATS IT WOULD BE CONCEIVABLE THAT A CUSTOMER OR JOHN COULD BE PROSECUTED FOR PANDERING WHICH OF COURSE IS A FELONY OFFENSE. SINCE THE CUSTOMER WOULD BE ENCOURAGING THE PROSTITUTE TO COMMIT A SINGLE ACT OF PROSTITUTION. AS COMMITTEE ANNOUNCES STATES THIS RACE IS A PROBLEM THAT LOWER LEVEL CONDUCT COULD BE PROSECUTED AND PUNISHED AND HIGHER LEVEL THAN WAS INTENDED BY THE STATUTE. CLOSE QUOTE BRANDING THE AMBIT OF OFFENDERS SUBJECT TO STATE PRISON UNDERCUTS THE STATE'S EFFORT TO COMPLY WITH A FEDERAL COURT ORDER MANDATING THAT CALIFORNIA MEET CERTAIN CAPS ON ITS PRISON POPULATION. A SECOND REASON UNDER SWING OPPOSITION IS THIS. THE PROPOSED DEFINITION OF PANDERING UNDER AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN IS VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS. I FOR EXAMPLE UNDER AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN A RUNWAY MINOR WHO WAS LEFT AT HOME TO AVOID ABUSIVE SITUATION. I COULD SAY TO ASSEMBLY SITUATED PEER CAUGHT YOU SHOULD CONSIDER HUSTLING BECAUSE I'M MAKING GOOD MONEY WAS QUOTE. AND SUBSEQUENTLY PROSECUTE FOR PAINTINGS A FELONY. THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AND A VICTIM OF SEX TRAFFICKING. THE REALITY IS THAT MANY WHO ENGAGE IN SELLING SEXUAL SERVICES OF SEPARATE THEIR HEART RENDING PLATES MANY VICTIMS OF SEXUAL TRAFFICKING OF SUFFERED. AND SHOULD NOT BE FOR THE VICTIMIZED BY BEEN CONVICTED OF FELONY PANDERING. WE RECOGNIZE THAT IT'S ALL IN THE PROCESS BUT BE ASKING ABOUT IT THIS TIME THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NATO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. KATHY SURE FOR THE ACLU OF CALIFORNIA CENTER FOR ADVOCACY IN POLICY AND AND ARM POLICY. OUT WE APOLOGIZE FOR NOT HAVING GOTTEN IN A LETTER ON THIS ONE BUT WE ARE IN OPPOSITION FOR THE REASONS STATED BY CBT. THANK YOU. AND WITNESSES GETTING QUESTIONS. GONZALEZ LECTER. SO I'M MISTER CUNNINGHAM BECAME CEO ON SCIENCE. AND IT'S HARD. LIKE TO LOOK IN THE EYE. SO. THE OPPOSITION BROUGHT TWO POINTS THE FIRST OF WHICH I THINK IS WRONG DAY HAD A BILL WANTS THAT. THE COP VETOED THAT. SAYS JOHN SHOULD BE HELD TO A FELONY STANDARD I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE THE PEOPLE ACTUALLY. PURCHASING SACKS WE NEED A. ACTUALLY HOLD RESPONSIBLE HOWEVER THE SECOND POINT IS ONE THAT I THINK I'M. I'M MORE SENSITIVE TAIL AND THAT'S WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK TO ENSURE WERE DEALING WITH. VICTIMS OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS VICTIMS AND SOMETIMES THAT CAUSES THEM TO DO OTHER THINGS THAT. NORMALLY WE WOULDN'T WANT THEM TO DO BUT THEY'RE UNDER A CERTAIN SITUATION WHERE WHERE. I'M A VICTIM OF HUMAN TRAFFICKING BASE OF THEIR SEX TRAFFICKING ON ASCENT OUT TO TO GO RECRUITING ENCOURAGE TOM. MORE GIRLS INTO THIS I WOULDN'T WANT THEM CAPTURED SO. I'M I KNOW THAT THE CHAIR HAS A. RECOMMENDED NO I'M VERY UNCOMFORTABLE I'M VOTING YES OR NO ON THIS BUT I WAS WONDERING. IF THERE'S ANYWAY YOU CAN. WE CAN'T HAVE I'M NOT SUGGESTING. ANY BUT IT'S EARLY IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS BUT IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK ON THAT SECOND PIECE. I'D BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS IF IT WAS ONLY AIMED AT EX IT IF THAT A FACT WOULD ONLY BE THAT. YOU KNOW JOHNSON PEOPLE PURCHASING SACKS WHERE FALLING UNDER THE PANDERING I'M FINE WITHOUT IT'S A SECOND PIECE I'M REALLY CONCERNED WITH AND THE REASON I CAN'T VOTE FOR THIS TODAY. RIGHT. COULD TAKE A MOMENT TO ADDRESS THE RUSSIAN. AB. YEAH SO ONE THING IN LOOKING AT THE SIMPLIFIED DEFINITION WE'RE TRYING TO. AND WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO SIMPLIFY AND NARROWED THE STATUTE. THAT'S THE INTENT I DON'T KNOW THAT WERE QUITE THERE WITH THE LANGUAGE WE HAVE THE WORD. ENCOURAGES INCLUDED WHICH IS PROBABLY. GETTING TO THE. THE THE ISSUE YOU HAVE WITH THAT I MEAN THAT PROBABLY IS A LITTLE BIT OF OVERBRETT THERE ARE POTENTIALLY COULD BE. USES SNARE SOMEBODY WHO'S A VICTIM THEMSELVES. SON I'M MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK ON. NEARING THE STATUTE ELIMINATING THAT TERM IS PROBABLY A GOOD START. I WOULD SAY THOUGH IT'S THE STATUTE NOW. THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE HAS. SIX PRONGS. THE SIXTH OF WHICH. IS. INCLUDES AN ATTEMPT TO PROCURE. YEAH IF BE SUCCESSFUL USED ASK SOMEBODY IF THEY'LL COME WORK FOR YOU AN. IN THE SEX TRADE. AND HE. THEY SAY NO BUT IF YOU CAUGHT ON. SOMEHOW THAT GETS RECORDED YOU CAN BE CHARGED I MEAN. IT IT'S VERY BROAD STATUE THAT STANDS NOW I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO ACTUALLY CAN. NARROW SIGNIFICANTLY AND CLARIFY AND THE PROSECUTORS NOW UNDER THE STATUTE HAVE FULL DISCRETION TO CHARGE. UNDER A BUNCH OF DIFFERENT THEORIES I MEAN THIS WOULD MAKE ONE THING IF YOU CAN MEET IF YOU CAN PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THEY DID THIS THING. WHICH WERE YOU KNOW DEFINING PANDERING ESSENTIALLY THEN. THEN YOU YOU'VE GOT A CASE AS A PROSECUTOR RIGHT NOW THAT THIS GIVES THEM A TON A THEORY ELECTIONS SO AT. I I GUESS I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT. WILL. THE PROPOSED NEW LANGUAGE OF THE STATUTE IS IN ANY WAY BROADENING. THE CRIME I THINK IT'S ACTUALLY NARROWING. BUT I'M HAPPY TO. AS. KINDA TOUGH ONE TODAY. AND I'M HAPPY TO WORK ON AMENDMENTS. ANY OTHER. COMMENT. WORK YEAH ARM. I AM BASING MY JUDGMENT ON WHAT THE ANALYSIS SAYS I THINK YOU ARE BROADENING IT. I DON'T BELIEVE IN THAT FELONY FOR TALENTS IS THAT REALLY WHAT YOUR INTENTION. WELL THE THAT THAT'S ARE ON THE BOOKS ALREADY BEEN. I FELL ON THE FOR PANDERING. ALRIGHT FOR PANDERING BUT. THE ANALYSIS SEEMS TO SAY THAT. JOHNS COULD ALSO BE. UNDER THE WAY YOU'VE WRITTEN THIS ALSO BE. RESPONSIBLE FOR A FELONY WHICH. I DON'T THINK MAKES GOOD SENSE AND AGAIN WERE. WHERE TRYING TO PUNISH OUR WAY OUT OF SOMETHING AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT WORKS? IS THAT NOT YOUR INTENT. CAN MISTER HOFFMAN ADDRESS THAT. NO THAT'S NOT MY INTENT. ALRIGHT. CHAIRPERSON ADDRESS THAT SURE. DIDN'T THE CASE LAW ON WHICH THE LANGUAGES BASED IS PRETTY CLEAR THAT A PERSON CANNOT BE CONVICTED OF PANDERING FOR. A ENACT A SOLICITATION OKAY SO IF IF. THE INTERPRETATION OF THE WAY THAT THIS IS DRAFTED SUGGEST THAT MAYBE THE CASE THAT IS NOT THE INTENT THE INTENSIVE TELLER THIS TO THE CASE LAW WHICH IS PRETTY CLEAR ON THAT POINT THAT THAT IS. NOT AN OUTCOME THAT WOULD BE INTENDED. BY THE AUTHOR WELL INTO LET'S CLARIFIED I REALLY CAN'T VOTE FOR THE BILL. SHOW. I'LL WANT TO HEAR WHAT THE CHAIR HAS TO SAY. THEY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS GO AFTER PEOPLE THAT ARE THAT ARE RECRUITING PEOPLE INTO THE INTO THE TRADE. ARRANGES CAUSES ENCOURAGES INDUCES PERSUADE TO PROCURE. ANOTHER PERSON TO BE A PROSTITUTE. AND. NO WE'RE NOT TRYING TO. THE BECAUSE THE SOLICITATION ASPECTS NOT INCLUDED IN THIS. CORRECTED THAT YOU'RE CLOSING ILLEGAL NOW. THAT NICKLAS VOTE BUT I I THOUGHT I WOULD MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS I. APPRECIATE THAT THE DIALOGUE MORE THAN HAPPY TO WORK ON. AND THEN IT'S THE. GET OUT A SIMPLIFIED STATUTE THAT'S MORE WORKABLE I THINK IN THE COURTROOM AND. I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION FOR OUR. FOR HUMAN TRAFFICKING EFFORTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU AS WELL I'M GOING TO ASK THE COMMITTEE. IS TO VOTE. S. DOWN VOTE NO. AND I WANT TO ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION. SO THAT WE HAVE TIME TO WORK ON IT BREAK OUT AT THE SOURCE. AND WHATEVER ELSE YOU NEED. TAKE TO I THINK YOU HERE'S A WILLINGNESS ON AT LEAST. TWO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT HAVE PROBLEMS WITH THE WORDING I I I I PROBLEMS WITH THE WORDING ALSO. AT A TO POINT WHERE. YOU KNOW UP WHICH CUNNINGHAM YOUR YOUR FORMER PROSECUTOR YOU COULD. TALK ABOUT HOW PEOPLE THAT IN THIS BUSINESS MAKE EXTRA MONEY MONEY DRIVE NEW CARS GOT A NEW HOUSE. AND IF SOMEBODY GOES OUT. AND DOES IT AND NEXT TO YOU KNOW. THEY SAY THAT MR CUNNINGHAM ENCOURAGEMENT THAT'S HOW BROUGHT I THINK THIS IS THAT. SOMEBODY THEY COULD COME AFTER YOU AND SO. BUT I THINK WE NEED TO. BELOW MORE SPECIFIC. AND IN MAKING SURE THAT WE DON'T A SNARE PEOPLE. WHO SOME KNOW DISRESPECTED? THAT A PROSECUTOR MAY HAVE. MAY OVER PROSECUTE OR OURS IN SNEER SOME PEOPLE THAT. MAY NOT HAVE HAD THAT INTENTION AND WHICH IS. TALKING FACT AN OFF THE CUFF SO IF WE. IF WE COULD VOTE THIS DOWN NOW AND THEN YOU WORK WITH. MEMBER THIS COMMITTEE. AND THE COMMITTEE STAFF BECAUSE I'M I'M NOT CERTAIN IF WE HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY WORK WELL WITH YOU ON THIS BILL RIGHT NOW. AND SO OF. I KNOW WE WERE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A LOT OF OTHER RECOMMENDATIONS AND AMENDMENTS THAT GOT A LOT OF BILLS THROUGH TODAY. AND. UNTIL A AT I DON'T THINK COLLEGES LAWSUIT WE JUST NEED TO REGROUP AND COME BACK AGAIN. SUBJECT RECOMMENDING A NO VOTE. IF THERE MOTION. ON AB SEVENTEEN THIRTY SEVEN THE MOTION IS TO PASTOR APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER. JONES SAWYER NO LACKEY LACKEY AYE CARILLO. PATIO NO CONSULTAS LECTURE. GONZALEZ FLETCHER NOT VOTING KILEY. KILEY AYE QUIRK. NO PARK NO SANTIAGO. THAT MEASURE FAILED. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR RECONSIDERATION PLEASE. GRANTED BY IN A GIVEN AYE EURONYMOUS CONSENT. THANK YOU MEMBERS. SO I'M I WILL HAVE. MISTER LACKEY GO UP NEXT. BECAUSE THEY'VE WAITED PATIENTLY. WHAT IF? LARGER JUST STEPPED DOWN. OH OKAY. SO WILL GO WITH. MS GONZALEZ FLETCHER. AND IT IS NOT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB NINETEEN NO THREE IS SIMPLE IT CAME OUT OF. A VERY. SIMPLE SITUATION THAT HAPPENED IN MY COMMUNITY. I'M DONE BY BACK BILLS ARE GUN BUYBACK PROGRAMS WE COULD TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE EFFECTIVE BUT THE PROCESS ARE THE REASON THAT WE DO THEM IS BASICALLY. TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GUNS OUT THERE WHETHER IT'S GUNS IN SOMEBODY'S HOUSE THAT THEY'RE NOT USING WHETHER IT'S BROKEN GUNS WHETHER IT'S LEGAL GUNS ON THE STREET. IT IS A DON'T ASK ANY QUESTIONS TURNING GUNS. I'M IN MY DISTRICT. WHILE THESE GUNS WERE BEING TURNED AND THEY WERE GETTING GIFT CARDS FOR A RETAILER'S. SOMETIMES THAT SOLD GUNS AND AMMUNITION AND IT'S JUST A COMMON SENSE MEASURE THAT I THINK IF OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GUNS THROUGH GUN BUY BACK PROGRAMS THAT WE DON'T THEN. I TURN AROUND AND GIVE A GIFT CARD TO A DEALER OF GUNS OR AMMUNITION SO IT'S COMMON SENSE TO PROTECT TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR MY VOTE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY OTHER WITH ANY WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. HOW YOU DOING? THE MAN WITH THE NEW BEARD. I MEAN HERE. HOW I WISH CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE CRAIG TO LOSE ON BEHALF OF THE FIREARMS POLICY COALITION? YOU OFTENTIMES WE SEE THESE MEASURES. INTRODUCED IN THERE CALLED COMMON SENSE AND THE THE FIREARM INTO SURE FIREARMS CULTURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THESE BILLS HAVE LITTLE TO NO IMPACT ACTUALLY SHOULD BE DEEMED. AS COMMON NONSENSE A THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE ARISES BECAUSE GIVE CARDS TO WALMART WHICH BY THE WAY DOES NOT SELL FIREARMS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER DO SELL IN SOME PLACES THEY DO SELL AMMUNITION. THE THE CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH THIS FIRST OF ALL IT'S JUST THE THEY AND I THINK EVERYONE CAN AGREE THERE'S QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. A GUN BUY BACK PROGRAMS WORK WILL MAYBE THERE ARE I I KNOW THAT THERE'S ENOUGH INFORMATION AS IS PROVIDED IN OUR LETTER THAT DEMONSTRATES THEY ARE NOT IN FACT EFFECTIVE. BUT THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITH GUN BUY BACK PROGRAMS IT IS LITERALLY A WAY FOR CRIMINALS TO DISPOSE OF FIREARMS THAT HAS BEEN USED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME. WITH ABSOLUTELY NO CONSEQUENCES AND NO QUESTIONS ASKED. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE AT THE VERY LEAST BE AMENDED TO REQUIRE THE RECORDING OF SIGNATURES OUR SIGNATURE OF SERIAL NUMBERS AND INFORMATION BALLISTICS INFORMATION ON THESE FIREARMS TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ARE INVOLVED. THEY HAD BEEN INVOLVED IN ANY CRIME BUT WITH THAT ONCE AGAIN THE IDEA PUTTING GOVERNMENT MONEY INTO PUT INTO A PROGRAM. OF THAT IS GOING THAT IS ALLOWS FOR. WEAPONS THAT ARE USED IN THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME IS JUST. LUDICROUS ALL IN THE GUISE OF SAYING WELL WE WANT TO. WE DON'T WE WANT TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF GUNS AND WE DON'T WANT TO PUT AN IMAGE OUT THERE THAT WE SUPPORT. FIREARMS WILL LET'S JUST BE CLEAR OTHER THAN THOSE WHO SELL THE FIREARMS THE NUMBER ONE PROFITEER ARE THE NUMBER ONE GROUP THAT RECEIVED THE MOST RESOURCES FROM GUN SALES AND AMMUNITION SALES. IS THE GOVERNMENT THE NUMBER ONE PURCHASER IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA OF FIREARMS AND AMMUNITION IS THE GOVERNMENT. SO IT IF WE WANT TO. REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE AMOUNT OF AMMUNITION THE AMOUNT OF FIREARMS THAT ARE OUT THERE IF WE REALLY DON'T WANT TO PROMOTE FIREARMS THEN MAYBE IT OUGHT NOT BE A BUSINESS THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PROFIT FROM AND PARTICIPATE IN. IS WITH THIS THAT WE ARE OPPOSE THIS MEASURE UNLESS IT IS AMENDED THANK YOU. THANK YOU MR DELUDE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. HEARING THE. WITNESS TO QUELL THERE IS ONE THING I HEARD WHICH IS SHOULD WE BE. GETTING SERIAL NUMBERS WHEN WE BUY BACK GUNS AND OTHERWISE MAKING SURE THEY HAVE BEEN USED IN A CRIME. I'M NOT QUITE SURE THE EFFICACY OF THAT BUT. YOU'RE NOT SURE EITHER OKAY LIKE I WANTED TO BE CLEAR I I AM NOT HERE I DID NOT CREATE THIS PROGRAM I HAVE MIXED EMOTIONS ABOUT THE GUN BUY BACK PROGRAM BUT. HAVING SEEN THEM. IN MY COMMUNITY I KNOW GUNS ARE ACTUALLY TURNED IN IN A WIDE VARIETY OF GUNS THINGS THAT ARE CLEARLY BROKE AND THINGS THAT LOOK LIKE NORMAL YOU KNOW. AT A HANDGUN AND A HOUSE THAT PROBABLY JUST IT'S BEEN SITTING THERE FOR THIRTY YEARS. THINGS THAT A MOTHER FINDS THAT THERE MAY BE THEIR SON HAD AND THEY DON'T WANNA GET THEIR SON IN TROUBLE. OR DAUGHTER ON THAT THEY FOUND IN THE CLOSET THERE'S NO OTHER WAY TO GET RID OF THIS KIND LEGALLY SO I'M GONNA I'M I'M GONNA COME DOWN AND SAY IF WE'RE TAKING GUNS OFF THE STREET I'M FOR. I'M FOR IT I'M FOR TAKING GUNS OUT OF SOMEBODY'S HOUSE THAT DOESN'T USE IT NO KID FINDS IT BLOWS HIS BRAINS OUT ONE KID IF WE SAY ONE KID I'M FOR ITS GOOD. BUT IF WE'RE GONNA DO THAT. AND ESPECIALLY BECAUSE I READ A STUDY. OUT OF MY MISERY THE UNIVERSITY MISSOURI. WHERE PROFESSOR WENT TO A ST LOUIS BY BACK AND THEY WERE GIVING CASH ABOUT ONE AND WE'LL DEAL WITH THAT LATER? BUT THIS IS JUST ABOUT THE THAT. THE GIFTCARDS BUT AT THAT ONE HE INTERVIEWED PEOPLE AND ASK WHAT THEY WERE GOING TO DO WITH THEIR CASH IN A NUMBER OF THOSE FOLKS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BUY A NEW. PAM. SO AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A PROBLEM AND SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ADDRESS BUT WHAT IT WAS SO OBVIOUS WALMART IS THE LARGEST RETAILER ITEM IN GUNS IN THE NATION. THEY DO SELL AMMUNITION IN CALIFORNIA THAT JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE THAT OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS WOULD ENCOURAGE SOMEBODY TO GO TO A RETAILER THAT SELLS COMES IN AND OR AMMUNITION AND SO THAT'S. THE NARROW FOCUS OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMIC. YOU MAY CLOSE I JUST WANNA CLOSE BY SAYING I RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE WITH THE OPPONENT WHO SUGGESTS I GUESS THAT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD HAVE GUNS UMPS OUT WITHOUT THAT. I DON'T THINK I'LL BE OFFERING UP THAT BILL DESPITE WHAT TO GET GUNS OFF THE STREET. RESPECTFULLY ASK WHEN I ABOUT. AND I AND I WON. IT LOOK I I WE HAVE A BUY. BACK PROGRAM IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES AND IN MY DISTRICT. AT THE COLISEUM WITH A HAVE A BUY BACK PROGRAM THE LINE GOES AROUND THE CORNER. IN FAT THEY RUN OUT OF GIFT CARDS AND MONEY. IF WE COULD BUY BACK ALL. THE GUNS WHICH WE CAN'T BECAUSE WE CAN'T AFFORD IT COULD WE DON'T MAKE A PROFIT. FROM BUYING THESE GUNS BACK IF WE COULD BUY THEM BACK. I IS A MEMBER OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE PUBLIC SAFETY. I PROBABLY WOULD BE ENCOURAGING THAT WE BUY MORE GUNS BACK BECAUSE I THINK THE MORE GUNS YOU TAKE OFF THE STREET. THAT COULD BE HARMFUL TO ANYONE WHETHER SUICIDE OR THE COMMISSION OF A CRIME OR ANYTHING DO WE NEED TO DO THAT. ARM I WISH THE GOVERNMENT COULD MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF BUYING BACK THESE THESE WEAPONS. ON THE OTHER THING IS THAT WHAT MR DELUDE BROUGHT UP IT WOULD I I BELIEVE THEY DO CHECK THE SERIAL NUMBER BUT I'LL DOUBLE CHECK. IF THEY DON'T THEN IT SHOULD BE ADDED TO THE BUY BACK PROGRAM AND. AND AND IF I HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOME LEGISLATION TO DO THAT THEN WE SHOULD. KNOW COLLECTED THEY HAVE SOME KIND OF WAY OF KNOWING WHERE THE GUNS CAME FROM WHEN THEY BUY THEM BACK BUT GET OUT I'LL DOUBLE CHECK. COULD NOT CERTAIN I JUST KNOW IN MY DISTRICT. THEY RAN OUT OF MONEY RIGHT BY BACK GUNS. FROM PEOPLE IN MY AT SOUTH LOS ANGELES IS A CASE YOU DON'T KNOW MY DISTRICT IF AND SEWER. OF THE CHAIRS RECOMMENDED AYE VOTE. IS THERE A MOTION. THEIR SECOND. SECOND. I AB NINETEEN NO THREE THE MOTION IS TO PASS APPROPRIATIONS JONES SAWYER AYE AYE JONES SAWYER AYE LACKEY. I CAN NOT VOTING CARDIO. CARILLO AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE KILEY. KILEY NO QUIRK AYE QUIRK AYE SANTIAGO. THAT MEASURE PASSES. MISTER LACKEY. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE RIGHT THERE. PERFECT YEAH. LAKE ON NEXT YEAR. YOU GO FIRST WHO. AND THEN THE MIKE RGS YEAH RIGHT AND THEN. CHAU CASSIDY. THANK YOU MISTER LACKEY WHENEVER YOU'RE READY TO BEGIN ALRIGHT WELL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT A BE EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE MOVE THE BELL. RUN A GOOD START. THIS LEGISLATION BUILDS UPON EXISTING LAW. THAT WAS APPROVED BY THE LEGISLATURE IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WHICH MADE IT A CRIME FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR THEIR DOG TO ATTACK A GUIDE. SIGNAL OR SERVICE DOGS WELL IT'S ACTIVELY PROVIDING SERVICE TO CHANDLER. UNFORTUNATELY CURRENT LAW FAILS TO ACKNOWLEDGE. THAT THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE SERVICE DOGS EXTEND BEYOND MOMENTS WHEN A DOG IS ACTIVELY GUIDING ITS HANDLER. THE VALUE AND SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DOG DOES NOT DIMINISH SIMPLY BECAUSE A HANDLER DECIDES TO ALLOW THE ANIMAL TO RELAX. WHILE WAITING FOR A BUS OR SITTING AT THE PARK. AB AGED SIXTY FIVE WILL REMOVE THE REQUIREMENT TO THE DOG BE PERFORMING ITS DUTIES AT THE TIME. OF BEING ATTACKED FOR IT TO BE A CRIME. ADDITIONALLY CURRENT LAW ALLOWS DOG OWNERS TO BECOME FIXATED THROUGH THE VICTIMS COMPENSATION FUND FOR VETERINARY BILLS OR THE COST OF REPLACING THE DOG. AB EIGHTEEN SIXTY FIVE WILL ALSO ENABLE THEM TO COLLECT ON MEDICAL EXPENSES INCURRED AND. LOST INCOME RESULTING FROM THE TIME SPENT WITHOUT THE SERVICES OF THE DOG. AND NOW TURN IT OVER TURNED I'M SORRY TURN TIME OVER TO OF THE SPONSORS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR THE BLIND. AND THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND CALIFORNIA. HI I THINK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND MISTER CHAIR. MY NAME IS SHANNON DEL AND I REPRESENT NATIONAL FEDERATION OF THE BLIND CALIFORNIA WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. I AM HAVE A THIS MY SECOND GUIDE DOG AND. MY FIRST GUIDE WAS A TALK TO COUPLE OF TIMES AND. FIRST I WANT TO ADDRESS AND PENAL CODE FIVE NINETY SEVEN FIVE NINETY SEVEN POINT ONE WHICH WAS BROUGHT UP IN OPPOSITION LETTER. THOSE CODES DO NOT SPECIFICALLY SPEAK TO THAT. ISSUE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE THEY SPEAK TO MALICIOUS TORTURE ARM TREATMENT. FOR NEGLECT OF ANIMALS IN. GENERAL. THE EXISTING LAW THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING. ADDING PROTECTION. THAT WORRIED EGGS EXISTING LAW THAT WHERE. DISCUSSING MAKING CHANGES TO SPECIFICALLY PROTECTS. GUIDE SERVICE AND SIGNAL DOGS WHO ARE ATTACKED BY THESE. A DOG THAT SOMEONE OWNS OUR HARBORS. AND DO WE WANT TO ADD THE PROTECTIONS TO THE DOGS IN TRAINING AS WELL AS DOGS WHO ARE. CURRENTLY WORKING BUT WHOSE HOME WHO ARE OUT OF HARNESS WHO ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE AND PERFORMANCE OF THEIR DUTIES WHEN THEY'RE ATTACKED THEM. EVERY DAY I GO TO WORK AND TAKE MY DOG AND PART OF THE IMPORTANCE OF TAKING MY DOG OUT OF HARNESS TO RELIEVE IT. IN PUBLIC BECAUSE OF WHERE I WORK I HAVE TO RELIEVE IN THE PUBLIC AND TAKE MY DOG OUT OF HARNESS EVERYDAY TO DO THAT. AND BECAUSE IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE DOG TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A TIME TO YOU DON'T GO TO THE BATHROOM IN HARNESS YOU ONLY GO TO THE BATHROOM WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF HARNESS. AND. SO THAT'S SOMETHING THE SCHOOLS TEACH US ALL IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SO BY DEFINITIONS ARE DOGS WILL BE OUT OF HARNESSES SOMEWHERE WHERE THEY CAN EASILY BE ATTACKED AND I HAVE HAD MY DOGS ATTACKED. UP NGUYEN RELIEVE PAIN BY DOGS LOOSE AND PUBLIC SO I'M. THIS BILL IS IS VERY IMPORTANT PROTECTING US ON. AND DOGS WHO ARE CURRENTLY IN TRAINING PARA EXPENSIVE THEY COSTS UPWARDS FROM SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EACH DOG. AND SPAY. THERE OFTEN WHEN YOU'RE ATTACKED THE DOGS GO OUT OF SERVICE THERE NO LONGER THEY'RE TRAUMATIZED IT CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE TO WORK ON. THE WIND MY LAST DOG WAS ON FINALLY ATTACK SHE JUST STOPPED WE STOPPED WORKING HER BECAUSE SHE. WAS FEARFUL OF DOGS WHENEVER I COLOR OF PARK. OR. WHEN. WHENEVER THERE WAS ANOTHER DOG SHE WOULD JUST BEGIN INTO SHE SHE COULDN'T FOCUS ON GUIDING ME SHE WOULD JUST. STOP AND START LOOKING AROUND FOR THE OTHER TODD. AND AND I WAS HORRIFIED TO SO IT'S.

ARE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FIRST I'D LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE. AND MY STAFF. FOR THEIR DILIGENT WORK ON THIS BILL. I'M PER COMMITTEE SHOULD. PER COMMITTEE. CAMP SUGGESTIONS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY WILL BE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS BEING DISTRIBUTED TO MEMBERS NOW. TO ALIGN TO BUILD WITH CURRENT LAW. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A. B. NINETEEN FORTY WHICH WILL ALLOW PAROLEES THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN. RE AND TO GRAYSON CREDITS TO REDUCE THE TERM OF HIS OR HER PAROLE. WHILE INCARCERATED FOLK'S HAVE ACCESS TO EDUCATIONAL VOCATIONAL PROGRAMS WHICH UPON COMPLETION CAN BE REDEEMED FOR TIME CREDIT OR SHORTENING A SENTENCE. WHEREAS PRO REQUIREMENTS ARE CURRENTLY TIME BASED AND NOT GOAL ORIENTED AB NINETEEN FORTY WILL INCENTIVIZE INDIVIDUALS TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS. THE BOOK THE BILL LAYS OUT. PACIFIC ON HOW MUCH TIME WE PROBABLY WILL EARN EACH YEAR FOR COMPLETING AN EDUCATIONAL DEGREE COLLEGE COURSE. COMMUNITY SERVICE HOURS GOOD BEHAVIOR OR SOME OF THE PEWS TREATMENT NOT MANDATED BY THE COURT. A. B. NINETEEN FORTY WILL ALSO HELP REDUCED CASELOAD FOR THE ALREADY OVERBURDENED PAROLE AGENTS AFFORDING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON PAROLEES THAT NEED EXTRA ATTENTION ASSISTANCE AND GUIDANCE Y. ALONE DOES ON EDUCATIONAL PATH. TO CONTINUE DRIVING AB NINETEEN FORTIES A MIDDLE GROUND APPROACH MODEL BY THE SUCCESS OF OTHER MORE CONSERVATIVE STATES WITH ME TODAY. IS DAVID MUHAMMAD EJECTED DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM AND MICHAEL MENDOZA POLICY ASSOCIATE WOULD CUT FORTY. I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. IT WOULD JUST BY. GOOD MORNING. TO CHAIRMAN JONES SAWYER AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS DAVID MUHAMMAD OF EXECUTIVE RECTOR OF THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE FOR CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM I'M ALSO A FORMER CHRISTIAN MINISTRY HER IN A NEW YORK CITY WASHINGTON DC IN HEARING CALIFORNIA. WHERE WAS THE CHIEF OPERATION OFFICER OF ALAMEDA COUNTY? I JUST BY TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FORTY A BILL THAT WOULD IMPROVE THE OUTCOMES OF PEOPLE ON PAROLE. EASE THE BURDEN OF OVERWORK PAROLE AGENTS AND INCREASE PUBLIC SAFETY. AB NINETEEN FORTY WILL INCENTIVIZE PAROLEES TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS BY PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT EDUCATIONAL CREDITS. OFFER EDUCATIONAL ACHIEVEMENTS AS WELL AS CREDITS FOR COMPLETING TREATMENT PROGRAMS AND VOLUNTEER SERVICE. THIS BILL WILL ENCOURAGE PEARL LISA FOCUSED ON THEIR OWN DEVELOPMENT TREATMENT. AND REFRAIN FROM CRIMINAL ACTIVITY. MY PASSING AB NINETEEN FORTY CALIFORNIA WILL JOIN THIRTY SIX OTHER STATES IN PROVIDING GOOD TIME CREDITS FOR PAROLEES WHO COMPLY WITH CONDITIONS OF THEIR SUPERVISION. AND STATE FREE FROM CRIME. BUT CALIFORNIA WILL BECOME A LEADER BY TAKING A STEP FURTHER AND INCENTIVIZING ACHIEVEMENT. THE EMPHASIS ON EDUCATION IN THIS BILL IS CRITICAL AND EVIDENCE BASED AID TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RAND CORPORATION STUDY REVEALED THAT PEOPLE IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM WHO COMPLETE IN EDUCATION PROGRAM. WERE FORTY THREE PERCENT LESS LIKELY TO BE SENT BACK TO PRISON THAN THOSE WHO DID NOT. PEARL THE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE INCENTIVES WILL BE INHERENTLY LESS AT RISK TO PUBLIC SAFETY. TO BEGIN WITH. AND THEY WILL ALSO REDUCE THEIR RISK AS THEY EARN COLLEGE CREDITS INCOMPLETE TREATMENT PROGRAMS. AS LOWER RISK PAROLEES EARNED TIME OFF ROLE. THIS WILL ALLOW PAROLE AGENTS TO FOCUS THEIR LIMITED TIME AND RESOURCES ON THE SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO POSE A GREATER RISK TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY. NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISION OF LOWER RISK PEOPLE IS AN EFFECTIVE. A WASTE OF RESOURCES AND ACTUALLY CAUSES WORSE OUTCOMES. ONE STUDY BY THE PEW CENTER ON THE STATE'S DETERMINE THAT AFTER FIFTEEN MONTHS OF CORRECTIONAL SUPERVISION WITHOUT A VIOLATION OR NEW OFFENSE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A PEARL WHO COMMITTED NEW CRIMES SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASES. OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS EIGHTEEN STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE ENACTED EARNED COMPLIANCE CREDITS WITH PROBATION AS A PAROLE THESE WHO CAN EARN THIRTY DAYS OFF OF THEIR SUPERVISION TIME FOR EVERY THIRTY DAYS OFF OF FOR NO VIOLATIONS OF NEW OFFENSES. DETAILED STUDIES IN TWO OF THOSE STATES MISSOURI AND ARIZONA. SHOW THAT THE NEW LAWS WERE ACHIEVING THEIR INTENDED IMPACT PEARL AGENTS CASE HOLES WERE SMALLER CORRECTIONAL SPENDING WAS REDUCED AND THE RECIDIVISM RATE OF THE PEOPLE WHO EARNED EARLY RELEASE DECLINED. CALIFORNIA HAS EVEN IMPLEMENTED A VERSION OF THIS UNDER AB ONE ON NINE PEOPLE RELEASED FROM PRISON ON POST RELEASE COMMITTEE SUPERVISION WHO WOULD HAVE BEEN ON PAROLE BUT ARE NOW UNDER PROBATION. COULD HAVE THEIR THREE YEAR SUPERVISION TERMINATED AFTER JUST SIX MONTHS AND MUST HAVE THEIR SUPERVISION TERMINATED AFTER ONE YEAR IF THERE ARE NO VIOLATIONS OF NEW ARRESTS. AND NOW CALIFORNIA CAN IMPROVE UPON THIS EFFECTIVE PRACTICE AND INCENTIVIZE PAROLEES NOT ONLY TO REFRAIN FROM CRIME BUT TO ACHIEVE SUCCESS. I STRONGLY URGE THIS COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE TO PASS AB NINETEEN FORTY THANK YOU. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ALLOWING ME THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SLIDE SUPPORT OF AB NINETEEN FORTY AS WELL. AT THE AGE OF FIFTEEN ENTRANCE THAT THE ALL PRISON SYSTEMS SERVE CLOSE TO EIGHTEEN YEARS. AND IT BECAME REALLY REAL FOR ME WHEN I EARNED A RELEASE STATES THAT I WAS COMING HOME. I WAS WELL AWARE OF THE CHALLENGES I WAS GOING TO FACE. AND ACTUALLY FACING THOSE CHALLENGES I DIDN'T KNOW TO BE QUITE DIFFICULT BUT THEY HAVE BEEN. I PAROLED CLOSE TO OVER THREE HUNDRED MILES AWAY FOR MY FAMILY AND ALL MY SUPPORT SYSTEM BECAUSE I HAD TO. TO START A NEW LIFE TO START OVER. TO THIS DAY I CAN VISIT MY FAMILY BECAUSE I CAN'T TRAVEL OUTSIDE OF FIFTY MILES. REST ASSURED I HAVE PERMISSION TO BE HERE TODAY. EVEN ALMOST SEVENTY MILES AWAY FROM HOME FOR ME. SO YES I HAVE A CHILD PASSED TO BE HERE. THOSE BARRIERS AND OTHERS MAKE IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO SUCCESSFULLY DISCHARGE PAROLE. AT TIMES YOU HAVE TO DECIDE WHETHER YOU WANT TO WORK FULL TIME OR TRY TO ADVANCE TO EDUCATIONAL DEGREE BY GOING BACK TO SCHOOL. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO DO BOTH. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW SOMEBODY LIKE MYSELF TO EARN EARLIER DISCHARGE. IT'LL GIVE ME THAT SENSE OF ACCOMPLISHMENT THAT I HAVE DONE THIS ON MY OWN. IT WILL GIVE YOU A GOAL TO REACH TOWARDS THIS WILL PROVIDE A A GOAL ORIENTED APPROACH ON PAROLE WHERE PEOPLE CAN. EARNED THAT THIS SHOW YOU SAY THIS IS WHAT I ACCOMPLISHED. AND THAT'S IS OF A CONSUMMATE ACCOMPLISHMENT GOES A LONG WAY EVEN AFTER THAT. I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL. ALTHOUGH MY DISCHARGE A PRO IS NOT FOR CERTAIN BECAUSE I AM ON LIFETIME PAROLE. THIS BILL BECOMES A GOAL THAT CAN REACH FOR A TAKE CHARGE OF AND WORK HARDER TOWARDS. THESE INCENTIVES AND REWARDS GIVE SUBSTANCE TO THE REASONS I SHOULD BE THIS CHARGE. AND PROVIDE A MORE MEANINGFUL EXPERIENCE FOR MYSELF AND OTHERS. SO I STRONGLY URGE FOR YOUR SUPPORT ON THIS BILL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE TIME THAT YOU ARE GIVING US. SORRY.

MORNINGS CHAIR MEMBERS SEAN OFTEN WITH THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. I RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION WHO BAIT AND SWITCH ADDED REALISM OPPOSING THE CHAIR TODAY. UP. WE APPRECIATE INTENT OF THE BILL CERTAINLY. TO CREATE SENTENCE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO REHABILITATE REINTEGRATE INTO THE COMMUNITY. AND CERTAINLY PROCEED THE AMENDMENT. I WAS TAKEN TO GET RID OF THE CREDITS FOR ESSENTIALLY NOT HAVING YOUR PAROLE REVOKED. OR CONCERNS THAT REMAIN. PRIMARILY THAT ALL OFFENDERS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE CREDITS INCLUDE PROMOTERS VIOLENT OFFENDERS SEX OFFENDERS EVEN THOSE ON LIFETIME PAROLE. I THAT'S THAT'S OF CONCERN TO US THE BILL DOES DIRECT THE DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND REHABILITATION AS WELL AS THE BOARD OF PAROLE HEARINGS PROMULGATE REGULATIONS. THAT COULD THEORETICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN OFFENDERS BUT AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE PROPERTY SEVEN REGULATIONS. THAT EXCLUDE SEX OFFENDERS WE THINK IT'S IT'S PROBABLY BEST THAT IF THERE ARE ANY INTENDED DISQUALIFIER IS THAT THOSE BE WRITTEN INTO THE BILL. ULTIMATELY THOUGH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BENEFIT FROM THIS ARE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHOSE OFFENSES WERE SO SERIOUS THAT THEY'VE RECEIVED LENGTHY PAROLE TALES. LOW LEVEL OFFENDERS TO THE EXTENT THAT ANYONE LOW LEVEL. GOES STATE PRISON AND ENDS UP ON PAROLE WOULD LIKELY BE OFF PEARL BEFORE MOST OF THESE CREDITS COULD BE EARNED. AND SO WE WE DON'T SEE THE PUBLIC BENEFIT IN HAVING SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENDERS UNSUPERVISED IN THE COMMUNITY SOONER AS THIS BILL WOULD CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SO FOR THOSE REASONS WE REMAIN OPPOSED. GOOD MORNING TO SHARE MEMBERS JOHN BAKER ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA CORRECTIONAL PEACE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION. AS WAS JUST MENTIONED WE AGREE WITH THE INTENT IN THAT THE PURPOSE BEHIND THIS BILL. CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN INCENTIVIZINGNOW THE RE ENTRY PROCESS. OUR OPPOSITION IS BASED ON THE FACT THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT NOW ON IT EARNED DISCHARGE POLICY. THERE ARE SOME INCONSISTENCIES. BETTER THERE ARE BETWEEN THE POLICY THAT WE'RE WORKING ON IT AND IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND WE DID HAVE A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL. AS WELL AS THE SPONSORS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS. SOME SPACE THERE THERE'S SOME ROOM THERE FOR US TO WORK. TO WORK TOGETHER. WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS HAVE BEEN TAKING. AND. AND WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH AND THROUGH THE REMAINING ISSUES BUT. UNTIL THAT'S INTO THAT HAPPENS WE WE REMAIN OPPOSED. ANY OTHER WITNESSES. I'M SORRY ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YOU MAKE CLOSER OKAY. BUT I'M SORRY. GO AHEAD. SKYLER. THANK YOU SO I THINK THERE IS. YOU KNOW GOOD IDEA. IN THIS BILL THAT. YOU KNOW EARNING REINTEGRATION CREDITS. FOR. THINGS LIKE THAT GETTING A DEGREE OR TREATMENT PROGRAMS OR AYE AYE PROBABLY SOME JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS OR THERE'S A. AND IT IN SPACE TO LINK TO REHABILITATION. REINTEGRATION RECIDIVISM. I THINK THAT THERE'S SOMETHING TO THAT IDEA BUT THEN THIS SEEMS TO ME TO KIND OF GO OVERBOARD AND THEN ALLOWING FOR CREDITS TO BE EARNED FIRST THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WHAT WORKING WITH A GOVERNMENT AGENCY. ANY FORM OF. WORKING FOR A NONPROFIT WITHOUT ANY LIMITATION EVEN VISITING JAILS SIZE SUN WONDERING HOW IT IS YOU KIND OF LANDED ON THAT THE UNIVERSITY YOU HAVE IN THIS BILL OF QUALIFYING ACTIVE. YEAH I THINK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SO. PART IS BILL IS TO. ENCOURAGE INDIVIDUALS FOR RANSOM TO SOCIETY TO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME WITH NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. SOME OF THINGS THAT I DO IS I NAM I VOLUNTEER MY TIME WITH ANTI WAS HIDDEN COALITION. TO GO BACK INTO PRISONS AND ENCOURAGE THE MEN AND WOMEN INSIDE TO DO THE BEST THEY CAN AND AND THIS IS IT AND PROVIDE WORKSHOPS ON. WHAT TO EXPECT WHEN THEY DO COME HOME? AND I BELIEVE THAT FOR ANY MAN OR WOMAN TO. BE ABLE TO VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME AND TO GO BACK INTO FACILITIES. TO BE OF SERVICE TO. THEIR COMMUNITIES TO MAKE THEIR COMMUNITIES SAFER BY. APPEARING THESE MEN AND WOMEN TO COME HOME AND HOW TO COME HOME I THINK THAT'S. SOMETHING THAT EVERYBODY ON PAROLE SHOULD BE INCENTIVIZE TO DO AND WHAT TO DO. I THINK IT ENCOURAGES PEOPLE TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES INSTEAD OF RECLUSIVE FROM THE COMMUNITIES. MANY TIMES A LOT PEOPLE PRO ARE DISCOURAGED. FROM VOLUNTEERING THEIR TIME MORE WORK EVEN HARDER. TO BE NOW STANLEY CITIZENS OF SOCIETY AND ALSO MOST OF THESE. INCENTIVES DO IS TO REALLY ENCOURAGE MEN AND WOMEN TO BE MORE PROACTIVE IN THE COMMUNITIES. AND HELP MAKE IT COMMITTEES EVEN SAFER SO THAT'S WHY IT THE VOLUNTEER TIME FOR. NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS IS IS IN THIS BILL. IT'S A CIVIC IN GAUGE MINT IS DEVELOPMENTAL AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT HAS BEEN FOUND TO RESEARCH TO BE A PART OF WHICH REDUCES RECIDIVISM AND SOLD THE WHOLE PART OF THIS BILL IS TO INCENTIVIZE ACTIVITY ENGAGEMENT TREATMENT THAT WOULD REDUCE AND INSTEAD OF OF RECIDIVISM. AND CIVIC ENGAGEMENT IS A SIGNIFICANT PART OF IT. IBM DOESN'T SEEM THAT IF IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE TO THAT EFFECT I MEAN. YOU KNOW I I AGREE THAT I HAD TO DO WITH THE FIRST GENTLEMAN SAID THAT THESE ARE I THINK THAT WE OUGHT TO ENCOURAGE ME THERE'S KIND OF AN UNLIMITED. AYE UNIVERSITY OF GOOD. HUMAN BEHAVIORS THAT WE COULD POTENTIALLY REWARD AND WHAT I THINK WE NEED TO HONE IN ON IS THOSE THAT HAVE A DEMONSTRABLE LINK. TO REHABILITATION REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND SO YOU KNOW AND I COULD SEE. A FIT BETWEEN ABOUT WHAT THE EVIDENCE SHOWS REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND WHAT WE'RE INCENTIVIZE IN THIS BILL THEN I THINK I CAN GET AROUND TO SUPPORTING IT BUT I'D THIS POINT I'M I'M GONNA WAIT TO SEE HOW IT EVOLVES AND I HOPE THAT YOU'LL. AYE PLEASE PASS MY CONCERNS ON THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU. AND THANK YOU TO THE COALITION FOR BEING HERE TODAY AND TO THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE COME TO YOUR HOUSE THE PEOPLE'S HOUSE AND HEARD YOUR STORIES. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT EVIDENCE YOU ARE THE WALKING EVIDENCE OF WHAT IT MEANS TO. LIVE THAT LIFE WANTS TO GO BACK TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND REALLY CHANGE THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT WHO WE ARE INCARCERATING AS IT HIGHLY IMPACTS PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR TESTIMONIES AND COMING TO OUR STATE CAPITOL IN BEING HERE ONCE AGAIN IN YOUR HOUSE THE PEOPLE'S. I'M ET I THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTIONS AND OF. A FIRST DATE THAT THE CHAIR HAD CONCERNED ABOUT. DOES THE. WHAT WE WERE DOING WAS OVER REACHING ARE GOING TOO FAR AND I THINK? DEE DEE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS TOOK SOME SOME AMENDMENTS DEBT THAT NARROWED IT SO THAT WE WE. LEAST CHAIR HAS CONFIDENCE IN SUPPORTING MOVING ON WITH THIS THAT THE SECOND PART MISTER LACKEY NINE. TO KILEY AND I ARE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE REHABILITATION PROGRAMS AND TWO OF US ARE LOOKING AT HOW THE. GET A SENSE AN AUDIT OR A SENSE OF DUTY WORK DON'T WORK AND. AND I THINK I'VE TALKED TO CCPOA ABOUT THAT SO THE ADAM. IF YOU'RE CONCERNED DUTIES PROGRAM DEFTLY WORKED IT. HAVING SOMEONE GOING TO LOVE VOLUNTEERING DOES IT ACTUALLY WORK IN AND GET SOME DATA. SO THAT WE CAN WE CAN SHOW HOW EFFECTIVE THEY ARE ON THE MOVE FORWARD SO. A. THE THIRD THING I IN THE FINAL THING I KNOW THE AUTHOR OF MR MCCARTY. I TO SPEAK FOR HIM HE'S VERY WILLING TO WORK WITH BOTH CCPOA IN AN IN CALIFORNIA DA'S. TO STRENGTHEN THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE BECAUSE ONE OF YOU WORK WITH THEM AS THEY GO WHEN ONE OF YOU WORK FOR THE COMBINED AARON.
