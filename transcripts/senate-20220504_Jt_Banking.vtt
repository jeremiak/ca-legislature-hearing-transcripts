CREATED THE CFPB. IN THE WAKE OF

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:55.321
THE GREAT FINANCIAL CRISIS SINCE

THE FINANCIAL CRISIS WE HAVE

00:05:56.756 --> 00:05:57.990
SEEN AN INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF

00:05:58.057 --> 00:05:59.959
INNOVATION IN CONSUMER FINANCIAL

00:06:21.914 --> 00:06:23.282

00:37:48.766 --> 00:37:52.370
pREASON WHY I ASK THIS QUESTION

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:54.538
IS BECAUSE- THERE'S INTEREST IN

00:37:54.605 --> 00:37:55.840
ISSUES OF ACCESS AND

00:37:55.906 --> 00:37:57.808
AFFORDABILITY. AND I'M JUST

00:37:57.875 --> 00:38:00.211
CURIOUS TO SEE ANY DATA ON WHAT

00:38:00.277 --> 00:38:02.179
TYPES OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES
