EXPANSION REPRESENTS A MAJOR

00:32:01.453 --> 00:32:04.356 region:rollup2
STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING GREATER

00:32:02.721 --> 00:32:05.557 region:rollup2
AND TIMELY OR CONSUMER ACCESS TO

00:32:04.356 --> 00:32:06.691 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM.

00:32:05.557 --> 00:32:07.926 region:rollup2
EVEN IF YOU ADD ENOUGH SLOTS TO

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:09.194 region:rollup2
THE PROGRAM TO ABSORB THE

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:09.761 region:rollup2
CURRENT WAITLIST WHICH IS

00:32:09.194 --> 00:32:12.164 region:rollup2
APPROACHING THREE THOUSAND

00:32:09.761 --> 00:32:13.265 region:rollup2
PEOPLE. THERE IS NO MAGIC WAND

00:32:12.164 --> 00:32:14.866 region:rollup2
TO GET AWAY THEN INSERT

00:32:13.265 --> 00:32:16.268 region:rollup2
INSTANTANEOUSLY AND ROLLED THOSE

00:32:14.866 --> 00:32:16.935 region:rollup2
PERSONS ON THE WAIT LIST.

00:32:16.268 --> 00:32:18.437 region:rollup2
THOSE PERSONS HAVE THAT

APPLICATION SUBMITTED TO THE

00:32:18.437 --> 00:32:20.672 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

00:32:18.970 --> 00:32:23.074 region:rollup2
SERVICES WHICH THAT TO BE

00:32:20.672 --> 00:32:23.975 region:rollup2
REVIEWED AND APPROVED.

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:25.477 region:rollup2
WE ESTIMATE THAT YES YES THE

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:26.978 region:rollup2
PROCESS ON AVERAGE ONE HUNDRED

00:32:25.477 --> 00:32:32.117 region:rollup2
APPLICATIONS PER MONTH.

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:32.717 region:rollup2
IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THEN.

00:32:32.117 --> 00:32:33.752 region:rollup2
AS A RESULT TOO SOON AND THE

00:32:32.717 --> 00:32:35.120 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT TO TAKE OVER TWO

00:32:33.752 --> 00:32:36.021 region:rollup2

ON THE WAITLIST.

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:37.989 region:rollup2
DURING THAT TIME ADDITIONAL

00:32:36.822 --> 00:32:40.525 region:rollup2
PEOPLE WILL BE APPLYING TO

00:32:37.989 --> 00:32:42.093 region:rollup2
ACCESS THE ALE W. AS THERE IS NO

00:32:40.525 --> 00:32:43.328 region:rollup2
PAS BUTTON ON DEMAND. SO ANYTIME

00:32:42.093 --> 00:32:45.263 region:rollup2
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT WAIT LIST

00:32:43.328 --> 00:32:47.399 region:rollup2
EVEN IF ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS LOTS

00:32:45.263 --> 00:32:49.201 region:rollup2
ARE EVENTUALLY ADDED DE EIGHT CS

00:32:47.399 --> 00:32:49.501 region:rollup2
FINDS ITSELF HAVING TO DIG OUT

00:32:49.201 --> 00:32:50.969 region:rollup2
OF A HOLE.

00:32:49.501 --> 00:32:52.604 region:rollup2
THE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ARE

00:32:50.969 --> 00:32:54.005 region:rollup2
THE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WHILE

00:32:52.604 --> 00:32:55.574 region:rollup2
LONG WAIT LISTS ARE PROBLEMATIC

00:32:54.005 --> 00:32:56.741 region:rollup2
FOR CONSUMERS OF ANY HOME AND

00:32:55.574 --> 00:32:58.443 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM THERE

00:32:56.741 --> 00:33:00.612 region:rollup2
ESPECIALLY PROP PROBLEMATIC FOR

00:32:58.443 --> 00:33:02.113 region:rollup2
PROGRAM TO SERVE OLDER ADULTS.

00:33:00.612 --> 00:33:04.015 region:rollup2
WHERE REMAINING LIFE EXPECTANCY

00:33:02.113 --> 00:33:04.950 region:rollup2
IS OF REAL CONCERN? THE AVERAGE

00:33:04.015 --> 00:33:05.984 region:rollup2
LENGTH OF STAY FOR ELDERLY

00:33:04.950 --> 00:33:07.185 region:rollup2
PARTICIPANTS IS TWO HUNDRED

00:33:05.984 --> 00:33:08.620 region:rollup2
FORTY SEVEN DAYS OR A LITTLE

00:33:07.185 --> 00:33:10.121 region:rollup2
OVER EIGHT MONTHS.

00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.156 region:rollup2
IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS OR MORE TO

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:13.158 region:rollup2
PROCESS EVERYONE ON THE WAIT

00:33:11.156 --> 00:33:14.593 region:rollup2
LIST IT'S REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE

00:33:13.158 --> 00:33:15.760 region:rollup2
THEN THAT NOT EVERYONE ON THE

00:33:14.593 --> 00:33:17.829 region:rollup2
WAIT LIST WILL SURVIVE THE WAIT.

00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.763 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS A SHAME.

00:33:17.829 --> 00:33:21.199 region:rollup2
THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPERATIVE THE

00:33:18.763 --> 00:33:21.766 region:rollup2
LW STAY AHEAD OF THE DEMAND

00:33:21.199 --> 00:33:23.134 region:rollup2

BEHIND.

00:33:23.134 --> 00:33:24.636 region:rollup2
LONG WEIGHTLESS IS ALSO

00:33:23.935 --> 00:33:26.071 region:rollup2
DETRIMENTAL TO PROVIDER

00:33:24.636 --> 00:33:27.439 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATION.

00:33:26.071 --> 00:33:28.406 region:rollup2
WHEN THE A ALL OF YOU COME TO A

PERIOD OF TIME NEW PROVIDERS ARE

00:33:29.841 --> 00:33:32.544 region:rollup2
LESS LIKELY TO ENROLL IN

00:33:31.409 --> 00:33:34.045 region:rollup2
EXISTING PROVIDERS ARE LESS

00:33:32.544 --> 00:33:35.814 region:rollup2
LIKELY TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATING

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:37.449 region:rollup2
OR WILL CHOOSE TO SCALE BACK

00:33:35.814 --> 00:33:39.017 region:rollup2
THEIR PARTICIPATION.

00:33:37.449 --> 00:33:40.051 region:rollup2
OFTEN CHOOSING TO USE THE LW

UNLESS THERE ARE CHANGES

00:33:43.955 --> 00:33:46.491 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WILL LOSE TRUST IN THE

BILL IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:19.784 region:rollup2
SURE THAT THE PUBLIC FINANCING.

UNDULY FAVOR SENDING PEOPLE TO

00:35:21.586 --> 00:35:25.357 region:rollup2
NURSING FACILITIES RATHER THAN

00:35:23.655 --> 00:35:26.925 region:rollup2
TO COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS LIKE

00:35:25.357 --> 00:35:29.294 region:rollup2
RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR

THEIR.

00:35:31.930 --> 00:35:34.733 region:rollup2
SEE THE CURRENT CAP OF

00:35:33.431 --> 00:35:36.167 region:rollup2
ENROLLMENT IS THIRTY SEVEN

00:35:34.733 --> 00:35:37.969 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE

00:35:36.167 --> 00:35:38.703 region:rollup2
STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS

00:35:37.969 --> 00:35:40.305 region:rollup2
OBVIOUSLY JUST A DROP IN THE

00:35:38.703 --> 00:35:42.207 region:rollup2
BUCKET.

00:35:40.305 --> 00:35:44.109 region:rollup2
WHEN YOU COMPARE TO THE. TENS OF

00:35:42.207 --> 00:35:45.410 region:rollup2
THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

00:35:44.109 --> 00:35:46.878 region:rollup2
OF AGING CALIFORNIA'S WE'RE

00:35:45.410 --> 00:35:47.812 region:rollup2
GONNA NEED SUCH ASSISTANCE.

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:49.280 region:rollup2
WE SPOKE ABOUT THE FINANCIAL

00:35:47.812 --> 00:35:50.749 region:rollup2
SAVINGS.

00:35:49.280 --> 00:35:52.150 region:rollup2
AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE

00:35:50.749 --> 00:35:53.952 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATES THE

00:35:52.150 --> 00:35:56.388 region:rollup2
ANNUAL COST OF NURSING FACILITY

00:35:53.952 --> 00:35:58.156 region:rollup2
CARE AT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND

00:35:56.388 --> 00:36:00.692 region:rollup2
DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN THE ANNUAL

00:35:58.156 --> 00:36:02.227 region:rollup2
COST OF ASSISTED LIVING SERVICES

00:36:00.692 --> 00:36:03.161 region:rollup2
AT SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS

00:36:02.227 --> 00:36:04.562 region:rollup2
ANNUALLY

00:36:03.161 --> 00:36:05.930 region:rollup2
SO THE STATE TABLE TO FUND FOUR

00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:07.465 region:rollup2
PLUS.

00:36:05.930 --> 00:36:10.135 region:rollup2
ASSISTED LIVING FOLKS RATHER

00:36:07.465 --> 00:36:11.770 region:rollup2
THAN ONE NURSING FACILITY PERSON

00:36:10.135 --> 00:36:13.104 region:rollup2
SO IT'S A WIN WIN FROM THE

00:36:11.770 --> 00:36:14.906 region:rollup2
CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW FROM

00:36:13.104 --> 00:36:16.474 region:rollup2
THE PROVIDERS POINT OF VIEW. AND

I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST FROM THE

00:36:16.474 --> 00:36:20.879 region:rollup2
STATE'S POINT OF VIEW AS WELL.

00:36:19.411 --> 00:36:22.514 region:rollup2
AND THEN OF A FINAL MENTION

00:36:20.879 --> 00:36:23.815 region:rollup2
ABOUT SOME OF THE OF MAY BE LESS

00:36:22.514 --> 00:36:25.450 region:rollup2
PROMINENT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL

00:36:23.815 --> 00:36:27.318 region:rollup2
THE BILL ADDRESSES SOME

00:36:25.450 --> 00:36:29.054 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT LOGISTICAL ISSUES

00:36:27.318 --> 00:36:30.488 region:rollup2
RELATING TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF

00:36:29.054 --> 00:36:33.091 region:rollup2
THE WAIT LIST. AND THE.

00:36:30.488 --> 00:36:34.926 region:rollup2
.

00:36:33.091 --> 00:36:36.227 region:rollup2
THE EFFICACY OF THE FINANCIAL

00:36:34.926 --> 00:36:37.529 region:rollup2
STANDARDS IT SOMEONE WHO'S

00:36:36.227 --> 00:36:39.030 region:rollup2
WORKED IN THIS FIELD FOR LONG

00:36:37.529 --> 00:36:41.032 region:rollup2
TIME I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVEN

00:36:39.030 --> 00:36:42.267 region:rollup2
AMONG PEOPLE WHO. WORK IN IT

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:43.568 region:rollup2
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:36:42.267 --> 00:36:45.303 region:rollup2
ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM IS

00:36:43.568 --> 00:36:46.671 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO OPERATE IN SOME REAL

00:36:45.303 --> 00:36:47.238 region:rollup2
DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN HOW

00:36:46.671 --> 00:36:48.973 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED OPERATE AND HOW IT

00:36:47.238 --> 00:36:50.275 region:rollup2
DOES.

00:36:48.973 --> 00:36:51.943 region:rollup2
AND IT THIS IS A TREMENDOUS

00:36:50.275 --> 00:36:53.511 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE

00:36:51.943 --> 00:36:55.080 region:rollup2
ISSUES IN THE STAKEHOLDER

00:36:53.511 --> 00:36:56.614 region:rollup2
PROCESS IN THE RENEWAL OF THE

00:36:55.080 --> 00:36:58.450 region:rollup2

00:36:56.614 --> 00:36:59.617 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION BETWEEN D. H. C.

00:36:58.450 --> 00:37:01.553 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS. SO THE

00:36:59.617 --> 00:37:03.154 region:rollup2
PROGRAM WILL WORK WORK MUCH

00:37:01.553 --> 00:37:06.324 region:rollup2
BETTER GOING FORWARD VERY MUCH

00:37:03.154 --> 00:37:07.792 region:rollup2
AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE

MEDI CAL OR OR ARE UNFUNDED.

01:41:00.988 --> 01:41:02.924 region:rollup2
AND THE PROBLEMS ONLY GOING TO

01:41:01.589 --> 01:41:04.425 region:rollup2
GET WORSE.

01:41:02.924 --> 01:41:06.627 region:rollup2
THAT SEEMS STUDIES SUGGEST THAT

01:41:04.425 --> 01:41:07.528 region:rollup2
IN TEN YEARS WE WILL HAVE A

01:41:06.627 --> 01:41:08.996 region:rollup2

I AND MANY OTHER RESIDENTS FACE

01:41:13.834 --> 01:41:16.537 region:rollup2

OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS

01:41:25.146 --> 01:41:28.649 region:rollup2
THE REALITY IS THOUGH THAT WHEN

01:41:28.649 --> 01:41:32.753 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT LOAN BURDEN.

01:41:30.418 --> 01:41:34.221 region:rollup2
ACCORDING TO BE A. M. C. THERE

01:41:32.753 --> 01:41:36.824 region:rollup2
IS THAT AN AVERAGE MEDICAL

01:41:39.694 --> 01:41:42.363 region:rollup2

THAT.

01:41:42.363 --> 01:41:46.834 region:rollup2
SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE.

01:41:44.465 --> 01:41:47.835 region:rollup2
