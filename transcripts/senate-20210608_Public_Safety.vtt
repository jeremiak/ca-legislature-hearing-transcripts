PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS ARE

00:34:14.786 --> 00:34:18.122
GOOD- BUT I'M JUST THINKING

00:34:18.189 --> 00:34:21.559
ABOUT- WHEN WE THINK ABOUT

00:34:21.626 --> 00:34:24.529
PEOPLE THAT ARE INCARCERATED.

00:34:24.595 --> 00:34:26.130
IT IS RARE FOR THEM TO HAVE

00:34:26.197 --> 00:34:27.865
SUCH PROFESSIONAL BACKGROUNDS

00:34:27.932 --> 00:34:30.935

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:47.051
HOW. ARE PRINCIPLES OF A JURY

00:34:47.118 --> 00:34:48.986

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:53.758
FOR ARREST. AND OUR PENAL CODE

00:39:53.824 --> 00:39:55.559
