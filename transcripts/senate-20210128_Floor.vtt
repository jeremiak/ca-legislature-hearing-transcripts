KNOW UNFORTUNATELY WE'VE SEEN A

00:33:42.620 --> 00:33:44.389
CONCERTED EFFORT AROUND THE

00:33:44.455 --> 00:33:46.090
COUNTRY AND I THINK EVERYONE

00:33:46.157 --> 00:33:47.258
KNOWS WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT

00:33:47.325 --> 00:33:49.193
AND WHO I'M TALKING ABOUT TO

00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.329
TRY TO DELEGITIMIZE VOTING IN

00:33:51.396 --> 00:33:54.165
THIS COUNTRY TO TRY TO. TO TRY

00:33:54.232 --> 00:33:57.034
TO RESTRICT WHO CAN VOTE IT'S

00:33:57.101 --> 00:33:58.703
NO LONGER LEGAL TO ACTUALLY

00:33:58.770 --> 00:34:01.139
EXPLICITLY BANNING CERTAIN

00:34:01.205 --> 00:34:03.007
KINDS OF PEOPLE FROM VOTING THE

00:34:03.074 --> 00:34:04.709
WAY THAT WE USED TO IN THIS

00:34:04.776 --> 00:34:06.544
COUNTRY BASED ON RACE OR

00:34:06.611 --> 00:34:09.547
WHATEVER ELSE SO NOW WE SEE

00:34:09.614 --> 00:34:11.082
EFFORTS TO RESTRICT VOTING

00:34:11.149 --> 00:34:12.984
THROUGH OTHER MORE NEFARIOUS

00:34:13.050 --> 00:34:14.752
WAYS IN SOME SENSE BECAUSE IT

00:34:14.819 --> 00:34:16.821
ACCOMPLISHES THE SAME RESULT.

00:34:16.888 --> 00:34:18.756
BUT IT'S NOT EXPLICITLY LABELED

00:34:18.823 --> 00:34:20.625
BLACK PEOPLE CAN'T VOTE FOR

00:34:20.691 --> 00:34:22.693
THIS KIND OF PERSON COUNT VOTER

00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:24.362
THAT KIND OF PERSON CAN VOTE

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:25.630
AND WE THEATER EFFORTS AROUND

00:34:25.696 --> 00:34:27.732
THE COUNTRY WITH THESE VOTER ID

00:34:27.799 --> 00:34:30.201
LAWS WITH- FRANKLY ILLEGAL

00:34:30.268 --> 00:34:33.037
PURCHASE OF VOTERS AND HERE IN

00:34:33.104 --> 00:34:35.306
CALIFORNIA AS WITH OTHER STATES

00:34:35.373 --> 00:34:36.707
WE'RE MOVING IN THE OPPOSITE

00:34:36.774 --> 00:34:39.310
DIRECTION AND MAKE IT EASIER

00:34:39.377 --> 00:34:41.212
FOR PEOPLE TO VOTE NOT HARDER

00:34:41.279 --> 00:34:42.647
AND IF THERE'S ANYTHING WE

00:34:42.713 --> 00:34:43.147
LEARNED FROM THIS LAST

00:34:43.214 --> 00:34:44.882
ELECTION. IS THAT THESE

00:34:44.949 --> 00:34:46.818
ALLEGATIONS OF VOTER FRAUD

00:34:46.884 --> 00:34:49.454
IMPROPRIETIES AND TAKE VOTING

00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:53.057
ARE COMPLETELY BOGUS AND WE

00:34:53.124 --> 00:34:53.758
LEARNED THAT NOT JUST FROM

00:34:53.825 --> 00:34:56.694
DEMOCRATS BUT FROM REPUBLICAN

00:34:56.761 --> 00:34:58.029
GOVERNORS AND SECRETARIES OF

00:34:58.096 --> 00:35:00.731
STATE WHO SAID THE VOTE WAS

00:35:00.798 --> 00:35:03.568
TOTALLY APPROPRIATE AND LEGAL

00:35:03.634 --> 00:35:07.572
AND NOT. FRAUDULENT SO THIS.

00:35:07.638 --> 00:35:09.407
MEASURE TODAY ALLOWS CALIFORNIA

00:35:09.474 --> 00:35:11.843
TO CONTINUE TO MOVE STRONGLY IN

00:35:11.909 --> 00:35:14.445
THAT DIRECTION. OF EXTENDING

00:35:14.512 --> 00:35:16.080
THE FRANCHISE TO MORE PEOPLE

00:35:16.147 --> 00:35:18.282
MAKE IT EASIER FOR PEOPLE TO

00:35:18.349 --> 00:35:21.018
VOTE I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE.

00:35:21.085 --> 00:35:21.652
THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER CENTER

00:35:21.719 --> 00:35:25.122
PAN- MADAM PRESIDENT TO

00:35:25.189 --> 00:35:27.158
SENATORS I TO RISE IN STRONG

00:35:27.225 --> 00:35:29.060
SUPPORT OF S. B. TWENTY NINE-

00:35:29.126 --> 00:35:30.828
HERE IN CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY MY

00:35:30.895 --> 00:35:33.631
COUNTY HERE IN SACRAMENTO WAS-

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.500
ONE THE PILOT COUNTIES FOR A

00:35:35.566 --> 00:35:37.602
VOTE BY MAIL- SEVERAL ACTION

00:35:37.668 --> 00:35:40.872
CYCLES AGO AND- IN FACT IT

00:35:40.938 --> 00:35:42.673
TURNED OUT VERY SUCCESSFULLY.

00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:44.775
AND THERE WAS NO SIGNIFICANT

00:35:44.842 --> 00:35:46.811
EVIDENCE OF ANY PROBLEMS OR

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:49.714
FRAUD- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.482
AS WE LOOK AT OUR ELECTIONS

00:35:51.549 --> 00:35:53.150
THAT PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE IN

00:35:53.217 --> 00:35:55.186
OUR ELECTIONS AND THAT MEANS

00:35:55.253 --> 00:35:56.487
THAT IS COMING ON US AS ELECTED

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:58.322
OFFICIALS NOT TO INSINUATES

00:35:58.389 --> 00:36:01.692
PROBLEMS UNLESS WE CAN PROVIDE

00:36:01.759 --> 00:36:02.793
STRONG EVIDENCE FOR THAT- ARE

00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:04.595
PAST SECRETARY OF STATE IS NOW

00:36:04.662 --> 00:36:06.197
ARE YOU A CENTER AND OUR FUTURE

00:36:06.264 --> 00:36:11.135
SECRETARY OF STATE I'M SURE.

00:36:11.202 --> 00:36:14.472
THE GATE- ANY ISSUES THAT

00:36:14.539 --> 00:36:16.707
ARISE- AND I THINK IT'S

00:36:16.774 --> 00:36:19.143
IMPORTANT THAT IF WE ARE AWARE

00:36:19.210 --> 00:36:20.111
EACH OF US IS ELECTED

00:36:20.177 --> 00:36:22.446
OFFICIALS- ARE AWARE OF

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.849
PROBLEMS THEN WE SHOULD. HAVE

00:36:24.916 --> 00:36:26.684
THEM IVESTIGATED SO WE CAN

00:36:26.751 --> 00:36:29.921
HAVE AN ACTUAL- RULING ON WHAT

00:36:29.987 --> 00:36:31.923
THE LEVEL OF TALENT AS IT IS

00:36:31.989 --> 00:36:34.091
NOW I WILL POINT OUT THOUGH IS

00:36:34.158 --> 00:36:34.959
THAT CERTAINLY THIS HAS BEEN

00:36:35.026 --> 00:36:37.862
DONE. AND IN FACT- ARE- MEDIA

00:36:37.929 --> 00:36:39.397
PAST PRESENT UNITED STATES

00:36:39.463 --> 00:36:41.532
ACTUALLY CONVENED A COMMISSION

00:36:41.599 --> 00:36:43.034
AND THEN DISBANDED WINDOWS NO

00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.303
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES THAT THEY

00:36:45.369 --> 00:36:48.172
FOUND- IN ADDITION THERE BEEN

00:36:48.239 --> 00:36:49.907
NUMEROUS INVESTIGATIONS DONE OF

00:36:49.974 --> 00:36:52.410
ALLEGATIONS HERE IN THIS

00:36:52.476 --> 00:36:54.412
COUNTRY BY. ELECTION OFFICIALS

00:36:54.478 --> 00:36:57.582
OF BOTH PARTIES. WHICH IS

00:36:57.648 --> 00:36:58.015
ESSENTIALLY FOUND NO

00:36:58.082 --> 00:37:01.852
SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS BENDS

00:37:01.919 --> 00:37:03.788
ADDITION WE'VE HAD OUR

00:37:03.854 --> 00:37:06.223
INDEPENDENT PRESS ALSO TRADED

00:37:06.290 --> 00:37:08.593
INVESTIGATIONS AND NOT FOUND

00:37:08.659 --> 00:37:11.429
SIGNIFICATIONS SO I HOPE THAT

00:37:11.495 --> 00:37:13.464
WE WHO ACTUALLY- ARE IN OUR

00:37:13.531 --> 00:37:14.932
POSITIONS BECAUSE OF THE

00:37:14.999 --> 00:37:17.168
ELECTION SYSTEM WE HAVE SO WE A

00:37:17.234 --> 00:37:18.603
PROBLEM TODAY I GUESS WE SHOULD

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.438
QUESTION OUR OWN PRESENCE HERE.

00:37:20.504 --> 00:37:23.107
WE SHOULD CERTAINLY HOLD PEOPLE

00:37:23.174 --> 00:37:24.976
ACCOUNTABLE BUT ALSO WE SHOULD

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:27.812
BE VERY CAREFUL NOT TO

00:37:27.878 --> 00:37:29.680
INSINUATE. SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS

00:37:29.747 --> 00:37:31.549
WHEN THERE IS WE CANNOT PRESENT

00:37:31.616 --> 00:37:33.417
EVIDENCE THAT THEY EXIST AND SO

00:37:33.484 --> 00:37:35.119
WITH THAT I URGE AN AYE VOTE ON

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:37.421
SB TWENTY NINE. THANK YOU

00:37:37.488 --> 00:37:39.190
CENTER PANTS CENTER BRADFORD.

00:37:39.256 --> 00:37:40.391
THINK ABOUT A PRESIDENT I TO

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.526
RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF S. B.

00:37:42.593 --> 00:37:44.095
TWENTY NINE AND- I'M SOMEWHAT

00:37:44.161 --> 00:37:45.363
DISMAYED WHEN I HEAR SOME OF

00:37:45.429 --> 00:37:47.298
THE BOGUS ARGUMENTS ON WHY.

00:37:47.365 --> 00:37:49.133
INDIVIDUALS SHOULD NOT BE

00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:50.434
ALLOWED TO MAIL IN THEIR

00:37:50.501 --> 00:37:52.436
BALLOTS BUT IT'S REALLY IRONIC

00:37:52.503 --> 00:37:54.338
TO ME THAT. MANY OF THE FOLKS

00:37:54.405 --> 00:37:57.541
WHO. ARGUED ABOUT. VOTER

00:37:57.608 --> 00:37:59.310
IRREGULARITIES AND ALL THOSE

00:37:59.377 --> 00:38:00.144
THINGS THAT HAPPEN AT THE TOP

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.646
OF THE BALLOT. THEY WERE QUITE

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:03.147
FINING BEING SWORN IN

00:38:03.214 --> 00:38:05.349
INVALIDATING THEIR ELECTION BE

00:38:05.416 --> 00:38:06.751
IT TO CONGRESO THE STATE

00:38:06.817 --> 00:38:08.586
LEGISLATURE BUT- EVERYTHING

00:38:08.653 --> 00:38:11.088
ELSE AT THE TOP WAS BOGUS SO- I

00:38:11.155 --> 00:38:12.123
THINK YOU NEED TO REALLY LOOK

00:38:12.189 --> 00:38:14.358
AT YOURSELVES AND I. ASK THE

00:38:14.425 --> 00:38:15.026
QUESTION WHO ARE YOU REALLY

00:38:15.092 --> 00:38:17.595
TRYING TO- PREVENT FROM VOTING

00:38:17.662 --> 00:38:18.696
I THINK AS MY COLLEAGUE

00:38:18.763 --> 00:38:21.365
CONCERNS THIS WAS STATED- EVERY

00:38:21.432 --> 00:38:23.434
PLACE THAT. THE SELECTION WAS

00:38:23.501 --> 00:38:27.672
QUESTION- OUTSIDE THE STATE OF

00:38:27.738 --> 00:38:28.272
CALIFORNIA WAS IN COMMUNITIES

00:38:28.339 --> 00:38:30.141
OF COLOR. AND A POOR PEOPLE

00:38:30.207 --> 00:38:33.010
AND- IT IN THIS IS WHO THIS IS

00:38:33.077 --> 00:38:34.412
TARGETING SAME HERE IN

00:38:34.478 --> 00:38:37.248
CALIFORNIA. I'M EXCITED ABOUT

DR WEBER- BECOMING OUR NEW

00:38:40.051 --> 00:38:41.352
SECRETARY OF STATE AND I THINK

00:38:41.419 --> 00:38:43.120
THE ACCOLADES THAT EVEN THE

00:38:43.187 --> 00:38:44.922
FOLKS SPOKE ABOUT DR WEBER'S

00:38:44.989 --> 00:38:46.824
INTEGRITY EVEN THOSE WHO DID

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:49.126
NOT VOTE FOR SPEAKS TO WHY THEY

00:38:49.193 --> 00:38:51.195
SHOULD. VOTE FOR THIS MEASURE

00:38:51.262 --> 00:38:53.097
BECAUSE WE HAVE SOMEONE NOW WHO

00:38:53.164 --> 00:38:54.932
WILL MAKE SURE AND CONTINUE ON

00:38:54.999 --> 00:38:55.900
IN A FINE EXAMPLE OF OUR

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.368
PREVIOUS SECRETARY OF STATE

00:38:57.435 --> 00:39:00.104
MAKE SURE ALL VOTES ARE COUNTED

00:39:00.171 --> 00:39:01.305
HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:39:01.372 --> 00:39:02.740
REGARDING WHAT YOUR PARTY IS

00:39:02.807 --> 00:39:03.941
WHAT YOUR GENDER WHAT'S YOUR

00:39:04.008 --> 00:39:05.509
ECONOMIC STATUS SO I STRONGLY

01:36:07.761 --> 01:36:09.430
LINE IN ALL OF THIS IS THAT IS

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:10.531
THAT OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE BEEN

01:36:10.598 --> 01:36:13.367
DEVASTATED. AND WHILE THE EXACT

01:36:13.434 --> 01:36:15.736

DEBT. THAT IS LOOMING AND IT IS

01:36:24.745 --> 01:36:27.081
GOING AND ACCORDING TO THE- ONE

01:36:27.148 --> 01:36:28.082
OF THE LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.083
AND I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY

01:36:29.150 --> 01:36:30.518
DILIGENTLY WITH. THEIR

01:36:30.584 --> 01:36:32.586
ASSESSMENT OF THE PAST DUE RENT

01:36:32.653 --> 01:36:35.189
IN THEIR REGION IS THAT WITHOUT

01:36:35.256 --> 01:36:37.358
SOME ECONOMIC RELIEF TENANTS

01:36:37.424 --> 01:36:38.592
WILL BE BURDENED BY RENTAL

01:36:38.659 --> 01:36:40.728
RENTAL DEBT. FOR THEIR

01:36:40.794 --> 01:36:41.595
LIFETIME. I MEAN THINK ABOUT

01:36:41.662 --> 01:36:43.998
THAT FOR THEIR LIFETIME. THEY

01:36:44.064 --> 01:36:47.468
WILL NEVER EVER BE ABLE TO PAY.

01:36:47.535 --> 01:36:49.036
PAST RENT DO BECAUSE I'LL

01:36:49.103 --> 01:36:50.938
ALWAYS BE WORRIED ABOUT PAYING

01:36:51.005 --> 01:36:52.039
TO KEEP A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD

01:36:52.106 --> 01:36:52.873
RIGHT NOW UNLESS WE DO

01:36:52.940 --> 01:36:54.575
SOMETHING. TO BE ABLE TO

01:36:54.642 --> 01:36:59.313
PROVIDE THEM. WITH THE RELIEF

01:36:59.380 --> 01:37:00.147
THAT THEY NEED NEED. SO THAT'S

01:37:00.214 --> 01:37:01.782
WHY NEED WE NEED TO ACT NOW TO

01:37:01.849 --> 01:37:03.317
TURKEY FOR NOW RELIEF. WHEN WE

01:37:03.384 --> 01:37:05.286

AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS

01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:15.229
ALL ABOUT IS. TRYING TO KEEP

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:16.997
PEOPLE IN THE HOME IN THE HOMES

01:37:17.064 --> 01:37:18.165
THAT THEY'RE RENTING AT THIS

01:37:18.232 --> 01:37:19.733
PARTICULAR TIME SO FIRST AND

01:37:19.800 --> 01:37:21.268
FOREMOST IT WAS TO EXTEND THE

01:37:21.335 --> 01:37:23.103
MORATORIUM. WE NEED TO ENSURE

01:37:23.170 --> 01:37:24.138
THAT FAMILIES ARE PROTECTED

01:37:24.205 --> 01:37:25.639
FROM BECOMING HOMELESS IN THE

01:37:25.706 --> 01:37:26.407
MIDDLE OF A PUBLIC HEALTH

01:37:26.473 --> 01:37:28.275
CRISIS. THERE IS NO REATER

01:37:28.342 --> 01:37:30.411
PRIORITY SECOND WE WANTED TO

01:37:30.477 --> 01:37:32.112

RENT FROM THEIR TENANTS AND ARE

01:37:37.017 --> 01:37:39.653
AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE. OR

01:37:39.720 --> 01:37:40.921
THEIR ECONOMICALLY

01:37:40.988 --> 01:37:42.489
DISADVANTAGED BECAUSE THEY

REQUIRE THAT INCOME IN ORDER TO

01:37:44.091 --> 01:37:45.492

AND TO MAINTAIN THEIR FAMILY

01:37:47.695 --> 01:37:49.897
NEEDS AS WELL. SO AS WE WERE

01:37:49.964 --> 01:37:51.065
LOOKING AT THE SITUATION WE

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.399

BACK ON THEIR FEET SO THAT THEY

01:37:55.502 --> 01:37:56.937
COULD. THEY WOULDN'T BE SETTLED

01:37:57.004 --> 01:37:59.306
BY THE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN.

01:37:59.373 --> 01:38:01.809
RENTAL DEBT AND FINALLY. ONE OF

01:38:01.875 --> 01:38:02.343

RIGHTS AND TRYING TO PROTECT

01:38:14.922 --> 01:38:17.024
THEM FROM ILLEGAL EVICTIONS.

01:38:17.091 --> 01:38:18.225
THAT ARE HAPPENING ALL OVER THE

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:19.460
STATE AND SO THE ADMINISTRATION

01:38:19.526 --> 01:38:21.061
AGREED TO EXPEDITE. THE

01:38:21.128 --> 01:38:22.997
FINANCIAL RESOURCES THAT WE

01:38:23.063 --> 01:38:25.633

OFFICES WERE STRUGGLING TO HELP

01:38:30.804 --> 01:38:32.373
TENANTS AND THAT WILL BE

01:38:32.439 --> 01:38:34.074
EXPEDITED AS PART OF THIS.

01:38:34.141 --> 01:38:35.542
PROCESS IS NOT IN THIS BILL BUT

01:38:35.609 --> 01:38:37.211
IT IS IN AN AGREEMENT WITH THE

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:39.480
ADMINISTRATION. WE WORKED

01:38:39.546 --> 01:38:40.981
REALLY HARD TO ACCOMPLISH THESE

01:38:41.048 --> 01:38:42.216

LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL

01:38:49.323 --> 01:38:51.125

WOULD HAVE BEEN VERY DIFFICULT

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:27.795
FOR US TO REACH THIS

01:39:27.861 --> 01:39:30.164

LAST AUGUST WE WERE OUT TO- PUT-

01:40:08.802 --> 01:40:10.571
AND- I BELIEVE THAT WAS THE

01:40:10.637 --> 01:40:12.940
THING TO DO WITH THE COPIER

01:40:13.006 --> 01:40:16.210
THAT WE WOULD NOT- IN THIS

01:40:16.276 --> 01:40:17.644
MONTH UNLESS THERE WERE

01:40:17.711 --> 01:40:19.146
SIGNIFICANT PROTECTIONS

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:21.181
AFFORDED TO LANDLORDS. BECAUSE

01:40:21.248 --> 01:40:23.250
YOU CAN'T FIX A PROBLEM IF

01:40:23.317 --> 01:40:23.984
YOU'RE ONLY ADDRESSING HALF OF

01:40:24.051 --> 01:40:28.055
IT I STILL FEEL THAT WAY TODAY.

01:40:28.122 --> 01:40:30.457
THIS FEDERAL FUNDING SOURCE

01:40:30.524 --> 01:40:34.395
IT'S A LITTLE CONFUSING. BUT

01:40:34.461 --> 01:40:34.962
FIRST AND FOREMOST ONE POINT

01:40:35.028 --> 01:40:38.432
FIVE BILLION. THAT'S A JOKE.

01:40:38.499 --> 01:40:39.900
NOW IT'S A GOOD START BUT

01:40:39.967 --> 01:40:41.368
ULTIMATELY WE'RE GOING TO NEED

01:40:41.435 --> 01:40:43.871
MUCH MORE AND I DON'T KNOW THE

01:40:43.937 --> 01:40:46.106
FULL BREADTH OF- MY COLLEAGUES

01:40:46.173 --> 01:40:49.943
BILL SB THREE- AND WHAT THAT

01:40:50.010 --> 01:40:51.879
WILL PROVIDE FOR LANDLORDS. BUT

01:40:51.945 --> 01:40:53.580
I'M HOPEFUL THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:40:53.647 --> 01:40:57.651
HONOR- THE INTERESTS AND- THE

01:40:57.718 --> 01:41:00.387
HOPE THAT WE HAVE GIVEN TO- NOT

01:41:00.454 --> 01:41:01.355
ONLY THE TENANTS BUT ALSO

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:02.956
LANDLORDS CALIFORNIA'S GOING TO

01:41:03.023 --> 01:41:05.092
STEP UP. IN COMPLEMENT THIS

01:41:05.159 --> 01:41:07.294
FEDERAL FUNDING. SO ALL THESE

01:41:07.361 --> 01:41:08.929
FRESNO IS THE AS A QUICK

01:41:08.996 --> 01:41:12.332
EXAMPLE APPARENTLY- IN PHASE

01:41:12.399 --> 01:41:14.234
ONE OF THIS PROGRAM. AND THE

01:41:14.301 --> 01:41:16.670
MEDIAN INCOME IN FRESNO IS

01:41:16.737 --> 01:41:18.238
FIFTY THOUSAND. THAT MEANS

01:41:18.305 --> 01:41:21.642
HOUSEHOLDS EARNING TWENTY FIVE

01:41:21.708 --> 01:41:22.376
THOUSAND WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR

01:41:22.443 --> 01:41:24.211
THIS PROGRAM WE'RE BY THE

01:41:24.278 --> 01:41:26.513
LANDLORD RETROACTIVELY IS ABLE

01:41:26.580 --> 01:41:29.850
TO- ACCUMULATE- IN SATISFIED

01:41:29.917 --> 01:41:32.986
PASS DEBTS FOR THE YEAR- BUT WE

01:41:33.053 --> 01:41:34.388
KNOW THAT IS A VERY SMALL

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:36.657
PERCENTAGE OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE

01:41:36.723 --> 01:41:40.427
RENTING. FOR THOSE HOUSEHOLDS

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.095
OR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND. I THAT

01:41:42.162 --> 01:41:43.130
I THINK A OF SOME THE SAID

01:41:43.197 --> 01:41:45.265
ISRAEL TWO WHERE YOU OF

01:41:45.332 --> 01:41:47.935
COMMUNITIES. AFFECTED BY COBIT

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:49.536
AS TO TURN BY THE HOUSING

01:41:49.603 --> 01:41:50.003
COMMITTEE DEVELOPMENT

01:41:50.070 --> 01:41:51.905
DEPARTMENT. I DON'T EVEN KNOW

01:41:51.972 --> 01:41:53.674
WHAT THAT MEANS I KNOW THAT IT

01:41:53.740 --> 01:41:56.043
WILL FIND ITS WAY OUT IN

01:41:56.109 --> 01:41:57.878
THROUGH ITS SYSTEM. BUT I THINK

01:41:57.945 --> 01:41:58.979
WE NEED A BIT MORE CLARITY ON

01:41:59.046 --> 01:42:01.648
WHAT DISCRETION IN METRICS AND

01:42:01.715 --> 01:42:02.449
THEY'RE GOING TO USE IN ROUND

01:42:02.516 --> 01:42:05.252
TWO. AND FINALLY IN ROUND THREE

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:06.887
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

01:42:06.954 --> 01:42:08.489
CIRCUMSTANCES NOT COVERED BY IN

01:42:08.555 --> 01:42:10.591
ROUND ONE OR TWO WITH INCOMES

01:42:10.657 --> 01:42:13.961
LESS THAN. EIGHTY PERCENT. SO

01:42:14.027 --> 01:42:14.962
WHAT I'M SAYING WITH ALL OF

01:42:15.028 --> 01:42:17.698
THIS IS I'M NOT EXCITED ABOUT

01:42:17.764 --> 01:42:20.367
SUPPORTING THIS ONLY BECAUSE-

01:42:20.434 --> 01:42:22.569
IT IS SO LIMITED BUT I WILL

01:42:22.636 --> 01:42:24.771
SUPPORT IT AND I'M AND VERY

01:42:24.838 --> 01:42:26.540
HOPEFUL. IN FACT I BE PLEADING

01:42:26.607 --> 01:42:28.275
WITH MY COLLEAGUES TODAY. I

01:42:28.342 --> 01:42:29.843
DON'T KNOW WHAT BILLS ARE IN

01:42:29.910 --> 01:42:31.144
THE WORKS RIGHT NOW OR OR

01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:34.314
ADVANCING- SERIOUSLY. BUT I

01:42:34.381 --> 01:42:35.449
BELIEVE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO

01:42:35.516 --> 01:42:37.784
STEP UP AND PROVIDE ASSISTANCE

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:39.419
NOT ONLY TO THE TENANTS WHICH

01:42:39.486 --> 01:42:41.722
WERE DOING. BUT ALSO THE

01:42:41.788 --> 01:42:43.657
LANDLORDS BECAUSE ONE POINT

01:42:43.724 --> 01:42:45.058
FIVE BILLION GIVEN THE NEEDS

01:42:45.125 --> 01:42:47.461
THAT WE BUT HER PROXIMITY-

ANYWHERE FROM FOUR FIVE BILLION

01:42:49.396 --> 01:42:51.632
OR EVEN MORE. THAT THIS WON'T

01:42:51.698 --> 01:42:53.567
BE ENOUGH IF WE ARE SERIOUS

01:42:53.634 --> 01:42:55.269
ABOUT MAKING MAKING CERTAIN

01:42:55.335 --> 01:42:56.537
THAT OUR HOUSING STOCK AND

WRITTEN UNDER THE FEDERAL

01:48:13.253 --> 01:48:13.987
