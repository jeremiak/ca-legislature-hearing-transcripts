WITHIN OUR STATE -- BETWEEN THIS IN OUR PRISON POPULATION IT'S VERY UNFORTUNATE THAT WE'VE SEEN SO MANY FATALITIES IN BOTH OF THOSE COMMUNITIES -- WE WANTED TO REVISIT THIS ISSUE BY TALKING TO BOTH

TOPIC -- FOR CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CODE IN NINETEEN RESPONSE I'M SPECIFICALLY TO -- OUR MOST FEDERAL CALIFORNIANS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS STATED IN PREVIOUS HEARINGS CDPH TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO LEARN FROM EARLY OUTBREAKS AND IMPLEMENT NEW PROACTIVE STRATEGIES AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AS WELL AS TAKING NEW ACTIONS TO IMPROVE TRANSPARENT COMMUNICATION TO THE PUBLIC INCLUDING LAUNCHING OUR NEW SKILLED NURSING FACILITY COVERED NINETEEN WEBSITE AND JULY THAT HIGHLIGHT STRATEGIES -- PROVIDES REAL TIME DATA AND SHARES INTERACTIVE GRAPHS INCLUDING COMPARISON GRAPHS TO US IN OTHER STATES -- ANNA GIVES UP TO DATE FACILITY INFORMATION FOR FAMILIES CONCERNED ABOUT THEIR LOVED ONES IN ABILITY TO VISIT IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT EIGHT CDPH REOPEN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA ON JUNE TWENTY SIXTH BY REQUIRING OMBUDSMAN ENTRANCE AND REQUIRING OUTDOOR VISITATION INDOOR INDOOR LARGE COMMUNAL SPACE VISITATION AND ALL FACILITIES AND MOST RECENTLY AS LATEST AS LAST FRIDAY WE ISSUED A NEW REVISION TO THIS POLICY THAT FURTHER OPENED UP VISITATION OPTIONS FOR IN ROOM VISITATION AND COUNTIES WITH LOWER SPREAD RATES IN OUR MOST RECENT EFFORTS WE FIRST MET WITH LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AS PARTNERS IN ADVANCE AND HOPES THAT WE CAN HAVE BETTER ALIGNMENT OF OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS IN OUR STATEWIDE VISITATION POLICY I'M AS A QUICK HIGHLIGHTS ACTIONS WE TOOK FOR TARGETED NOT CODED NINETEEN TESTING YOUR CO HOARDING IMPLEMENTING ENFORCING COULD NINETEEN MEDICATION PLANTS WE GO ON SITE AND FORCES EVERY FOUR TO SIX WEEKS I'M EXPANDING STATEWIDE INFECTION PREVENTION EDUCATION RESOURCES AND IMPLEMENTING PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS AND REAL TIME ALERTS DASHBOARDS TO MITIGATE HIGH RISK FACILITIES SOME OF THE OUTCOMES OF OUR INTERVENTIONS I'M HERE TO SHARE WITH YOU TODAY IS THAT SO FAR THESE ACTIONS HAVE PROVEN TO BE NOTABLY SUCCESSFUL WAS SIGNIFICANT REDUCTIONS IN CASES AND MORTALITY I SNIFF STATEWIDE WELL EVEN COMMUNITY CASE RATES HAVE HAD SEARCHES IN LATE SUMMER AND EVEN WHEN WE'VE SEEN VARIOUS SPIKES DURING PANDEMICS IN IN THE PANDEMIC OF HOSPITALIZATIONS DESPITE THE HIGH CASE RATES CO CASES AND COUNTIES IN AUGUST AS WELL AS HIGH RATES OF HOSPITALIZATIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN LATE SUMMER THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY CASE RATES MORTALITY RATES CONTINUE TO STABILIZE AND DECLINE INTO THE FALL FOR EXAMPLE IN MAY THE OVERALL MORTALITY RATE IN CALIFORNIA IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WAS EIGHT POINT SIX AND A COMMITMENT MID OCTOBER IT IS NOW REDUCED TO ONE POINT NINE THE COVERT NINETEEN MORTALITY RATE IN MAY IN CALIFORNIA WAS TWO POINT TWO WHICH IS NOW BEEN REDUCED TO OAK POINT FOR WE LOOK AT COMPARISON NAME I'M COMPARING ON CALIFORNIA TO OTHER STATES CALIFORNIA HAS BY FAR THE MOST NEW FACILITIES AND RESIDENTS IN OTHER STATES IN SOME CASES WE HAVE TRIPLE OR DOUBLE WRITTEN SOMETIMES QUADRUPLE THE AMOUNT ON THAT OTHER STATES BUT THE STATE'S MOST SIMILAR TO CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN COMPARE TO AS FAR AS RESIDENT POPULATIONS ARE NEW YORK TEXAS AND FLORIDA WELCOME IN NINETEEN SPECIFIC MORTALITY RATES ARE NOW LOWEST IN NEW YORK NOW AFTER A HUGE SPIKE IN -- OF FEBRUARY AND MARCH CALIFORNIA HAS LOWER KOBE NINETEEN MORTALITY RATES IN TEXAS AND FLORIDA AND CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL SKILLED NURSING FACILITY MORTALITY RATES ARE LOWER THAN ALL STATES BY SIGNIFICANT MARGINS AS OF MID OCTOBER FLORIDA'S MORTALITY RATE IS FIVE POINT ONE NEW YORK IS FOUR POINT EIGHT TEXAS IS FOUR POINT ONE AND CALIFORNIA IS ONE POINT NINE -- HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT IN PREPARE PREPARATION FOR FLU SEASON FOR A POTENTIAL POST FALL WINTER HOLIDAY SPIKE AFTER HALLOWEEN THANKSGIVING EXCEPT TRUCK AND AFTER A POTENTIAL SECOND WAVE SURGE RECENTLY WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME FACILITIES WITH NEW OUTBREAKS NINE MONTHS IN THE PANDEMIC ALTHOUGH WE HAVE FEWER FACILITIES WITH THESE ISSUES WE HAVE LOOKED AT RECENT ROOT CAUSES TO THESE OUT LIARS TO IDENTIFY NEW INTERVENTIONS GOING INTO THE WINTER SEASON THE FIRST NEW INTERVENTION THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THIS WEEK AND NEXT CMS'S PROVIDING TECHNICAL TRAINING AND ASSISTANCE TO ALL OF OUR MANY STAFF OUR NEW STAFF AND EXISTING STAFF ON LEVERAGING FEDERAL REGULATIONS WHICH ARE STRICTER -- IN REGARDS TO INFECTION CONTROL PROCESSES AND INNER VELOP THEM INTO OUR SYSTEMS WE'VE CREATED FOR PANDEMIC RESPONSE THE SECOND -- APPROACH IS THAT WE ARE EXPANDING OUR PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS SOME OF THE MOST RECENT OUT BREAKS THAT HAVE HAPPENED ARE DUE TO UNDER CD PH IS JURISDICTION OUT OF -- OUT OF VIOLATIONS FROM OUR PARTNER -- COMPLIANCE AND REGULATIONS AND SO NOW WE WILL BE EXPANDING SOME OF OUR HIGH RISK PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS DATA BY PARTNERING WITH OTHER DEPARTMENTS LIKE DH CS DEPARTMENT I'M SORRY DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ARE SPOTTING CAL OSHA -- SO THAT WE CAN LOOK AT COMPLIANCE DATA FROM OTHER REGULATORY DEPARTMENTS AND SEE IF THERE ARE HIGH RISK THEMES THAT WE CAN PUT INTO OUR ALGORITHMS WILL ALSO BE INCLUDING FLU OUTBREAK DATA FROM PRIOR YEARS SO THAT WE CAN ALSO INCLUDE THAT AS FAR AS A HIGH RISK FOR AN OUTBREAK AND WILL ALSO BE LOOKING AT CHILD CARE OUTBREAKS WITHIN THE SAME ZIP CODE OF A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AS THAT IS USUALLY AN EARLY INDICATOR OF A COMMUNITY SPIKE I'M AND WE ALSO HAVE NEW OUTBREAK DEMOGRAPHICS THAT WE HAVE ACQUIRED FROM CMS -- THAT WE CAN ALSO USE AS FURTHER DATA TO USE IN A PREDICTIVE MODEL STAFFING WE ARE WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP NEW STAFFING STRATEGIES FOR SEARCH THAT WILL BE PUBLISHED IN UPCOMING OFFICE SAUDIS LETTER SOME OF THE STRATEGIES INCLUDE TARGETING INFECTION CONTROL STRIKE TEAMS TO LOCATIONS WITH SHORT STAFFING TO RE EDUCATE OF PROPER COURTING AND HAVE SURVEYORS REASSESS EMERGENCY STAFFING WAIVERS FOR THOSE FACILITIES WHO HAVE NOT PROVIDED ADEQUATE SAFE STAFFING LEVEL PLANS OR WHO HAVE NOT MAINTAIN STOUT SAFE ENVIRONMENT FOR BOTH STAFF AND RESIDENTS AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST WE ARE PARTNERING WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO LOOK AT -- QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABLY ACCOUNTABILITY SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT INCENTIVES WE'VE NOTICED THAT MANY AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND IN THE HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEM ARE EXPERIENCING BURNOUT AND PANDEMIC FATIGUE AFTER INCREDIBLY LONG HOURS SEVEN DAY WORK WEEKS AN INSURMOUNTABLE STRESSFUL SITUATIONS FOR TEN MONTHS SOME HEALTH CARE WORKERS AND FACILITIES HAVE SWITCHED TO NEW PROTOCOLS ESTABLISHING NEW NORMAL AND HOW THEY OPERATE AND RED PANDEMIC WHEREAS OTHER FACILITIES SADLY ARE STILL STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN THIS LEVEL OF INFECTION CONTROL PRECISION THAT IS REQUIRED AT ALL TIMES PARTICULARLY WHEN WORKING WITH RESIDENTS WHO MAY NOT BE COMPLIANT AND WEARING MASKS OR RESIDENTS WHO MAY WANT TO RECORDED SENSE PART OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS WORKING ON THE CFL WHICH PROVIDES AUSTIN SENTENCE FOR FACILITIES TO DEMONSTRATE COMPLIANCE WITH C. DPH COVERED MEDICATION REQUIREMENTS AND THIS WILL GO INTO EFFECT IN JANUARY CDPH WAS ONLY ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY IMPLEMENT THESE STRATEGIES AND FURTHER STRENGTHEN FACILITY INFECTION CONTROL RESPONSE BY WORKING IN REAL TIME WITH OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS COUNTY LEADERS AND ALSO BY WORKING TOGETHER WITH OUR FELLOW DEPARTMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF AGING DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CAL OSHA JOSH BUT CALLAWAY YES I'M SORRY TO NAME A FEW I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND GERIATRIC SPECIALIST INCLUDING THE DIRECTOR COUNCIL WHICH IS TODAY'S PANEL CHARLENE HERRIN TINA'S ON AS WELL AS TODAY'S PANELISTS LIKE WHITE MIKE WASSERMAN WHO PARTNERS ON WEEKLY STATEWIDE WEBINARS WITH CDPH WE DEEPLY APPRECIATE THESE OPPORTUNISTIC CONTENT ENGAGE WITH SOMETIMES ON A DAILY IF NOT WEEKLY BASIS TO DISCUSS OF SHORT TERM PANDEMIC RESPONSE AND LONG TERM NEEDED REFORMS AND FINALLY BEFORE WE OPEN IT UP TO THE REST OF THE PANELISTS I WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW AND FOR THOSE OF MY STAFF WERE LISTENING TODAY HOW DEEPLY GRATEFUL I AM TO ALL OF OUR C.

P. P. H. HERE AT THE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING A METHODOLOGY TO AUDIT BECAUSE THE NINETEEN RELATED EXPENDITURES AS PART OF OUR ANNUAL CONTRA AUDITING PROGRAMS TO ENSURE THAT FACILITIES ARE SPENDING A TEN PERCENT INCREASE OF FIND AN APPROPRIATE WAY TO MAXIMIZE INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENT CENTER FOR SENIORS HAVING CARE THE AVERAGE MEDICAID INCREASE COUNTRYWIDE WHAT'S FIVE PERCENT IN RESPONSE TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY FOR EXAMPLE OREGON PROVIDED A TEN PERCENT RATE INCREASE FROM APRIL FIRST THROUGH JUNE THIRTIETH OF TWENTY TWENTY THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA PROVIDED A TWENTY PERCENT RATE INCREASE TO NURSING FACILITY THROUGH THE END OF THE NATIONAL PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY WASHINGTON STATE PROVIDED A PER DIEM ADD ON REIMBURSEMENT OF TWENTY NINE DOLLARS WHICH WILL AND THE LAST DATE OF BACK CALENDAR QUARTER IN WHICH THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY AND FOR COMPARISON THE CALIFORNIA TEN PERCENT IN EQUITY ON AVERAGE TO A TWENTY FOUR DOLLAR INCREASE IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE -- THEM OR MEASURE THAT THE IMPACT ON THE RATE INCREASE ON FACILITY THAT THAT HIGH AND YOU TO LACK OF DATA BUT I THINK AS YOU HEARD FROM -- THE PREVIOUS THEIR -- GREAT THING AND -- OUR FACILITY IS NOW WITHIN OUR OUR FACILITY FOR MEDICARE ALL -- CLINICAL LABORATORY PROVIDERS PROVIDING SPECIMEN COLLECTION FOR KOBE NINETEEN TESTING PER RESIDENTS AND STILL THERE THINK THE PHILIPPINES ARE ELIGIBLE TO BILL MACCALLUM THE CLINICAL LABORATORY PROVIDERS ARE ELIGIBLE BILL FOR THE DIAGNOSTIC TESTS AND SPECIMEN COLLECTION SERVICES SEPARATELY EACH FOR KOBE NINETEEN TAPPING FOR STILL NURSING FACILITY WORKERS COVERAGE FOR THE COST OF TESTING WILL BE REVIVED THE SPECIFIC CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE WORKER OR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WORKERS WHICH SPENT ON THE COMING NINETEEN INSPECTION OR WHO HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WOULD COME IN NINETEEN WORKERS CAN BE TESTED AT ANY TESTING PROVIDER AND THEIR HEALTH PLAN MUST COVER THE FULL COST OF THE CAST FIRST BILL NURSING FACILITY WORKERS DO NOT HAVE BEEN DONE OR AND OR A KNOWN OR SUSPECTED EXPOSURE TO SOMEONE WITH CALVIN NINETEEN THEIR STATE REGULATED HEALTH PLAN NOT COVER THEIR CODE IN NINETEEN PASSED HOWEVER THE WORKER MUST GO THROUGH THEIR HEALTH PLAN TO BE TESTED IN THE NETWORK AND THE WORKER IS LIABLE OR NORMAL COST SHARING AGAIN I WANT TO THINK THAT THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME HERE TO TESTIFY AND AND -- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AFTER THE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WE HAVE A DOCTOR MICHAEL WASSERMAN WHO IS A PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE DR OSMAN THANK YOU -- GERMAN CAME COMMITTEE MEMBERS THOSE WHO SAY WE DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS COMING TO NURSING HOMES IN MARCH AND APRIL WEREN'T LISTENING TO THE EXPERTS IN GERIATRICS AND LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE ON MARCH NINTH I TOLD NBC NEWS THAT THE CORONA VIRUS WAS THE GREATEST THREAT TO NURSING HOME RESIDENTS THAT WE'VE SEEN ON MARCH TWENTY FIFTH I TOLD CBS THAT NURSING HOMES COULD BECOME ARE KILLING FIELDS MY EXPERIENCE AS A CLINICAL AND QUALITY EXPERT IN ADDITION TO HAVING BEEN THE CEO OF THE LARGEST NURSING HOME CHAIN IN CALIFORNIA GIVE ME A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE INTO CODE NINETEEN AND THE MEASURES THAT NEED TO BE TAKEN TO REDUCE ITS IMPACT AND DEVASTATION I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLYMAN WORD FOR BRINGING AB TWENTY SIX FORTY FOUR INTO LAW ITS REQUIREMENT OF A FULL TIME EQUIVALENT OF INFECTION PREVENTION US IN EVERY NURSING HOME IS THE TYPE OF WORK FORCE CHANGE THAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT VULNERABLE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS BUT IT'S ONLY THE BEGINNING I COME HERE TODAY IS IMMEDIATE PAST PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE AND CURRENT CHAIR OF OUR PUBLIC POLICY COMMITTEE TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE ACTIONABLE AND SUSTAINABLE AS WE MOVE FORWARD TODAY'S NURSING HOMES ARE ESSENTIALLY MANY HOSPITALS REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY DELIVER POST ACUTE CARE OR PROVIDE LONG TERM CARE TO THE MOST FRAIL COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING POPULATION OF PATIENTS IN OUR HISTORY THE AVERAGE NURSING HOME RESIDENT HAS MULTIPLE CHRONIC CONDITIONS COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT REQUIRES PROFESSIONAL OVERSIGHT AND CARE FROM A BROADER WAY OF CARE GIVERS AND HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS HISTORICALLY A MAJOR ROLE OF THE NURSING HOME ADMINISTRATOR HAS BEEN TO PUT HEADS IN BEDS THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR BY FEDERAL REGULATION IS SUPPOSED TO BE THE CLINICAL LEADER OF A NURSING HOME IN USUAL PRACTICE UNFORTUNATELY MEDICAL DIRECTORS ARE OFTEN SEPARATED FROM CLINICAL POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND DECISIONS REGISTERED NURSES AT PROTEST PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE TRAINED TO ASSESS PATIENTS ARE SOMETIMES NOT AVAILABLE TO MAKE NECESSARY ASSESSMENTS IN REAL TIME HOW DO WE RUN MANY HOSPITALS WITHOUT THE CLINICAL LEADERSHIP AND STAFFING THAT ARE SO VITAL COBIT NINETEEN HAS BRUTALLY EXPOSED THIS WEAKNESS THERE IS NOW AMPLE LITERATURE TO DEMONSTRATE THE TWENTY FOUR HOUR ARE IN COVERAGE AND A MINIMUM OF FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF OUR IN STAFFING RESIDENT PER DAY ALONG WITH ENOUGH ALBION AND CMA COVERAGE LEADS TO FEWER COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS AND DEATHS CONSULTANT PHARMACISTS MUST ALSO BE ENGAGED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT I CAN TELL YOU BASED ON OVER THIRTY YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN THE FIELD OF GERIATRICS THEY'RE HAVING A COMPETENT AND ENGAGE MEDICAL DIRECTOR TO WORK WITH THE NURSING STAFF AND THE INFECTION PREVENTION NEST AS WELL AS THE GUIDED MINISTRY -- SURE OF LITTLE CLINICAL EXPERTISE HAS PLAYED AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN BATTLING THE SCOURGE THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND COUNTRY I AM A FACULTY MEMBER FOR THE AMERICAN BOARD OF POST ACUTE AND LONG TERM CARE MEDICAL DIRECTOR CERTIFICATION COURSE AS I RECENTLY PARTICIPATED IN THE THREE DAY COURSE THAT COMPLETES THE TRAINING ALL I COULD THINK OF WAS WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT WOULD HAVE MADE IF EVERY NURSING HOME IN THE STATE HAD A CERTIFIED MEDICAL DIRECTOR OVER THE PAST EIGHT MONTHS I GUARANTEE YOU THAT IF THAT HAD BEEN THE CASE AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE APPROPRIATE NURSE STAFFING LEVELS FAR FEWER NURSING HOME RESIDENTS WOULD HAVE DIED EVERY NURSING HOME IN THE STATE ALREADY HAS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND NURSING HOME OWNERS ALREADY SPENT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON MEDICAL DIRECTOR STIPENDS BY REQUIRING CERTIFICATION YOU WILL SURE THAT NURSING HOME MEDICAL DIRECTORS HAVE THE TOOLS THE SKILLS AND THE PROFESSIONAL OBLIGADO DR WERE PROVIDED ALL OF WHITE OVERSIGHT DR OSMAN CAN YOU HOLD ON FOR ONE SECOND -- YEAH GETTING A JOB -- -- ONE OF THE REMOTE MEMBERS CANNOT HEAR THE SPEAKER IS THERE A WAY TO CAN YOU CHECK THE AUDIO YEAH -- NO THAT'S PROBABLY BECAUSE OF THE SAME ISSUE YOUR PATIENCE DOCTOR WANTS ME TO JUST HOLD ON ONE SECOND OH NO PROBLEM YEAH TESTING ONE TWO TESTING ONE TWO THE FIRM -- THERE CAN CAN ONE OF THE MEMBERS WHO TEXTED ME JUST TEXT ME BACK GOOD POLICY GIVE KEEPER IF YOU COULD KEEP SPEAKING DR OSMAN JUST TEXT ME BACK TO CONFIRM THAT YOU CAN HEAR DR OSMAN OKAY SO EVERY NURSING HOME IN THE STATE ALREADY HAS A MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND NURSING HOME OWNERS ALREADY SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY ON MEDICAL DIRECTOR STIPENDS BY REQUIRING CERTIFICATION YOU WILL SURE THAT NURSING HOME MEDICAL DIRECTORS HAVE THE TOOLS THE SKILLS AND THE PROFESSIONAL OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE QUALIFIED OVERSIGHT THIS WILL NOT INCREASE COSTS TO THE STATE OR THE INDUSTRY BUT IT WILL IMPROVE QUALITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE BASED LITERATURE THAT DEMONSTRATES A CORRELATION BETWEEN FOR PROFIT STATUS AND THE SIZE OF COVERT NINETEEN OUTBREAKS AND DEATHS THE MOTIVATION FOR PROFIT MUST SOMETIMES BE REINED IN TO AVOID HARMING THE CUSTOMER MANIPULATION OF EXISTING RELATED PARTY TRANSACTION REPORTING CAN ALSO SKEW ACTUAL FACILITY LEVEL PROFITABILITY THIS IS WHY WE MUST HAVE COMPLETE TRANSPARENCY AROUND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE AS WELL AS GIVING STRONG CONSIDERATION TO A MEDICAL LOSS RATIO PARAMETERS FOR NURSING HOMES LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST CNA'S THE TRUE HEROES OF THIS PANDEMIC MUST BE TREATED WITH THE RESPECT AND DIGNITY THEY SO RICHLY DESERVE AND FINALLY EARN A LIVING WAGE I ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO PAY EXTRA ATTENTION TO THE COMMENTS OF NICOLE HOW AND DR CHARLENE HARRINGTON I RESPECT AND VALUE THEIR INSIGHT AND OPINIONS THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS THANK

THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TEAM FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY BEFORE YOU AND THIS DISTINGUISHED SUBCOMMITTEE MY GOAL TODAY IS TO HELP PAINT A PICTURE FOR YOU AND THE OTHER MEMBERS PARTICIPATING TODAY AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE STATE OF LONG TERM CARE IN CALIFORNIA EIGHT MONTHS INTO THE PANDEMIC AND AS WE LOOK AT LONG TERM CARE I WANT US TO THINK OF A BROADER VIEW OF WHAT THIS LOOKS LIKE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT I ASKED WE CONSULT ALL THREE HUNDRED EIGHT THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS LIVING IN LONG TERM CARE IN CALIFORNIA IN BOTH RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITY FOR THE ELDERLY AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SO AS YOU KNOW AS A LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN I ALONG WITH THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE CHARGED WITH ASSISTING RESIDENTS AND FAMILIES TO RESOLVE ISSUES OF THE COLLECT POOR CARE BEDSORES EVICTION AND DISCHARGES AND OFTEN WE ARE THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO FAMILIES HAVE TO TURN TO TO HELP THEM RESOLVE THESE ISSUES BUT FOR NEARLY SIX MONTHS LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN LIKE SO MANY LICENSING AGENCIES WERE PREVENTED FROM ENTERING FACILITIES LEAVING BUT RESIDENTS HIGHLY VULNERABLE TO POOR CARE AND LACK OF SUPPORT ADVOCACY AND I THINK SOMETIMES WHAT WE HEAR THESE HEARINGS WE HEAR THE AMAZING STATE PLANS BUT WE DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND HOW DOES THE FACT THE INDIVIDUALS ON THE GROUND AND SO I LIKE ALL OF YOU DON'T NESTLE PARTICIPATE INDIVIDUAL CARE MEETINGS BUT LAST WEEK I HAD A STAFF OUT ON VACATION AND SO THEY LET THE BOSTON AND HELP OUT AND I HEARD EXACT PERFECT EXAMPLE OF WHAT HAS BEEN GOING ON IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES SINCE OMBUDSMAN HAVE NOT BEEN PART OF THE DAY TO DAY OPERATIONS WE HAD A RESIDENT WHO'D BEEN SKILLED NURSING FACILITY FOR MANY YEARS WHO THE GREAT FAMILY THEY HAD A CARE GIVER THAT HELP TO PROVIDE CARE TWENTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK BUT DURING COLLEGE SHE'D LOST NEARLY TWENTY POUNDS SHE BEGAN TO DEVELOP PRESSURE SORES SO THE FAMILY IN GOOD FAITH GOT MEDICARE HOSPICE INVOLVED THAT IS PAID FOR BY MEDICARE SHE WAS ARTIFICIALLY RT BEING PAID BE A MEDIC CAL THE CARE GIVER THAT WAS COMING IN THE FACILITY WAS OUT FEEDING HER SOME OF HER MEALS EACH DAY AND WAS TAKING THE TIME THAT SHE I NEEDED IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT HER SHE RETAIN WEIGHT I WE TALKED WITH THE SILLY BAD ENSURING THAT SHE HAD ADEQUATE -- WOUND CARE AS WELL AS SOMEONE TO SIT WITH HER JUST TWICE A DAY AND SPEND TWENTY FIVE MINUTES BEATING HER THE RESPONSE WAS WE DON'T HAVE TIME FOR THAT AND I THINK THAT IS THE TRUE STORY OF WHAT WE'RE SEEING WHICH IS FACILITIES MAY BE WELL MEANING WHO ARE VERY BUSY WITHOUT PROPER OVERSIGHT WE'RE SEEING A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN CARE AND THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR RESIDENTS AND I THINK THIS IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF THE ISSUES THE COPA NINETY SIX WEIGHTED THEY'RE NOT HIGHLY TECHNICAL OR COMPLEX THEIR BASIC ISSUES OF STAFFING MANAGEMENT LEADERSHIP AND INFECTION CONTROL NOW IN CALIFORNIA FACILITIES -- THIS SUMMER WHEN THEY WERE PATIENTS WITH ONE COPA NINETEEN FACTION AT THOSE FACILITIES HAD ON AVERAGE TWENTY FIVE PERCENT FEWER REGISTERED NURSES IN THE BUILDING AT THE END OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT SHOULD TELL YOU A LOT OF THINGS BUT ONE OF THOSE THAT ARE AND TAKE NO GUFF AND IF THEY ARE IN BUILDINGS AND PRESENT BUILDINGS THEY DRASTICALLY IMPROVE CARE THE OTHER PART OF IT IS THAT AS OF THIS SUMMER ABOUT NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THE FACILITIES THAT HAD ACTED COLLUDED NINETEEN OUTBREAKS NINETY ONE PERCENT OF THOSE HAD A PRIOR VIOLATION RELATED TO INFECTION CONTROL THAT MEANS THEY WERE CITED FOR ISSUE WHEN THEY KNEW THAT THE LICENSING ENTITY WAS THE BUILDING AND I DON'T THINK THIS TO INDICT THE FACILITIES BUT I DO THIS TO SAY THAT WE'VE HAD A DEMONSTRATED HISTORY OF A LACK OF ENFORCEMENT IN FACILITIES AND WE COULD IDENTIFY WHERE THE PROBLEM ISSUES WERE GOING TO HAPPEN NOW POOR STAFFING IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES WAS AND CONTINUES TO BE THE GASOLINE TO COPE WITH NINETEENTH MATCH WITHIN THE LONG TERM CARE INDUSTRY DIRECT CARE WORKERS ON AVERAGE EARN ONLY ONE TO TWO DOLLARS MORE PER HOUR THAN MINIMUM WAGE TO DO THE MOST CRITICAL WORK THAT WE HAVE TO CARE FOR OLDER AND DISABLED ADULTS THESE DEDICATED PEOPLE WORK SIXTY TO EIGHTY HOURS PER WEEK OUT OFTEN AT MULTIPLE LOCATIONS TO PAY THE MOST MODICUM OF AND MODEST OF RENT AND EXPENSES MEANWHILE YOU MAY HAVE A CARE GIVER BECAUSE OF THE SYSTEM THAT IS WORKING AT MULTIPLE LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES MEANING THEY COULD BE WORKING AT THE FACILITY EIGHT WHERE THERE IS A CURRENT ACTIVE OUTBREAK AND THEY COULD THEN BE GOING TO CARE FOR A FEE AT FACILITY B. AND THIS PRACTICE IS NOT EXPRESSLY PROHIBITED BY OUR LICENSING BODIES NO IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THESE CRITICAL ISSUES I'VE RAISED YOUR DEBT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT A COUPLE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THE FIRST AND I THINK THIS ECHOES DR WATERMAN SENTIMENTS IS WE NEED TO REQUIRE LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES TO IMMEDIATELY RAISE COMPENSATION FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS AND CAREGIVERS THIRTY PERCENT AND I KNOW THAT'S MIGHT SEEM LIKE A LOT TO YOU BUT I WANT TO GIVE YOU A SENSE OF WHAT THAT REALLY IS TALKING ABOUT THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR THESE PEOPLE ARE DOING CRITICAL WORK AND WE NEED TO HELP MAINTAIN AND RETAIN THE INDUSTRY AND AGAIN YOUR PUBLIC BUT NICOLE WE ALREADY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH CARE GIVERS AND THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA TELL YOU A LITTLE BIT A LITTLE WORN WHICH IS THAT I HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT IN CONTRA COSTA COUNTY WE'VE CREATED TO HEALTH CARE CAREER PATHWAY WHICH IS A COMPREHENSIVE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANTS THAT IS BOTH PERSON CENTERED IS BASED IN REALITY AND HAS COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS AND WE HAVE NEARLY A HUNDRED PERCENT GRADUATION RATE AND WE HEAR FROM THE FACILITIES THAT THE C. N. A.'S THAT COMPLETE THAT PROGRAM OR MORE AKIN TO PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN WORKING FOR A YEAR IN THE INDUSTRY AND WHAT'S IMPORTANT ABOUT THAT IS THAT IT'S VERY CHALLENGING TO CREATE CERTIFIED NURSING ASSISTANT PROGRAMS THE REQUIRED -- THE CURRICULUM BY CDPH IS PARTICULARLY PRESCRIPTIVE AND RESTRICTIVE AND ALLOWS VERY LITTLE MOVEMENT FRANKLY NONE FOR WHAT THE REALITIES OF CARE GIVING OUR SO I ASK YOU TODAY TO DEDICATE A STATEWIDE TASK FORCE TO REVIEW THE CURRENT TRAINING PROTOCOLS FOR CNA'S AND ALLOW THIS TASK FOR TO BE BOLD AND TO BE INNOVATIVE AND PROPOSED UPDATES THE TRAINING CURRICULUM AND THE TESTING PROCESS THERE ARE CURRENTLY CNA'S WHO COMPLETED TRAINING DURING QUARANTINE DURING KOBE THEY COMPLETED THEIR TRAINING BUT THEY'VE BEEN UNABLE TO TEST BECAUSE THERE IS SUCH A BACKLOG AT TESTING CENTERS MEANWHILE WE HAVE ISSUE STOPPING WAIVERS TO ALLOW SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO OPERATE AT LESS THAN OPTIMUM STAFFING NEXT I LIKE THIS TO TALK ABOUT THE CREATE COMPREHENSIVE STRAIGHT TEAM I HAVE SEEN WHEN THERE IS AN OUTBREAK THERE IS STILL A GAP BETWEEN THE LICENSING ENTITY BE THAT CDSS WERE C. PH AND LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE THOSE ENTITIES ARE NOT NORMALLY IN FACILITIES EVERY DAY THERE IS A LACK OF DISCERNMENT FOR THOSE BAD ACTORS WHO WOULD CHOOSE TO USE THIS SITUATION TO NOT BE ENTIRELY TRANSPARENT ADDITIONALLY WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM WITH STAFFING ALL TOO OFTEN FACILITIES ARE GIVEN A LIST AND TOLD TO CALL STAFFING AGENCIES WHEN WHAT WE NEED TO AS ENFORCEMENT ENTITIES WE NEED TO CALM WITH TRAINS YOU NAY TO HER TO WORK ON THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY WE CANNOT SIMPLY SEND IN WELL MEANING AND WELL TRAINED EMTS WHO ARE NOT ABLE TO ACTUALLY DO THE WORK AND THIS ACTUALLY PROLONGS THE OUTBREAK AND I BELIEVE DIMINISHES CARE WE NEED TO DIRECT CITY PH ANSI PSS TO ADOPT A MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH AS IT RELATES TO EMERGENCY PLANNING WE CAN NO LONGER SIMPLY SAY TO REVIEW AN EMERGENCY PLAN A FACILITY THERE NEEDS TO BE AN APPROVAL AND A CLEAR DISTINCTION TO ENSURE THAT THEIR PLANS ARE ARE READY FOR EXAMPLE IN CINEMA COUNTY THERE WAS EVACUATIONS AND FACILITIES EVACUATED TO A LOCAL EVACUATION CENTER SLATED FRAIL AND OLDER ADULTS IN THE MIDDLE THE NIGHT TO A PLACE WHERE THEY ARE ON MANY MORE PEOPLE WITHOUT A PLAN TO MOVE THOSE PEOPLE TO ADDITIONAL FACILITIES WE NEED TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHEN WE'RE EVACUATING WHERE RESIDENTS ARE GOING AND THE TRANSPORTATION PLAN TO GET THEM THERE WE ALSO NEED TO GET A CLEAR COMMITMENT FROM BOTH CD PH AND CDSS ABOUT THE RETURN TO NORMAL OPERATIONS AND ENSURE THAT NO ONE REVERTS TO TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WE NEED OUR ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES TO BE ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND TO BE ENFORCING THE REGULATIONS THAT WE THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE SPOT FOR OVER MANY YEARS THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ATTENTION TO THIS ISSUE I HOPE THE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THIS LONG AFTER COPING NINETEEN AGAIN ISSUES WE'RE SEEING HAPPEN TODAY ARE NOT SO MUCH ISSUE OF COCA NINETEEN BUT A FAR TOO LONG WE HAVE NOT GIVEN ENOUGH ATTENTION TO THOSE OLDER AND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCES ABILITIES THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU MICHELLE NEXT WE HAVE DOCTOR CHARLENE HARRINGTON WHO'S A PROFESSOR AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO DR HARRINGTON THANK YOU SIX THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO SPEAK TODAY ON BEHALF OF MYSELF AND MY COLLEAGUES AT UCSF AT KAT CAL HOSPITAL COMPARE AT UC DAVIS AND USC SINCE MARCH CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES HAVE FACED A HUMANITARIAN CRISIS RESIDENTS ARE LESS THAN ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION BUT ACCOUNT FOR TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF ALL CALIFORNIA DEATHS THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT LEGISLATIVE CHANGES CAN BE ADOPTED THAT WILL SAVE LIVES BY ADDRESSING THREE AREAS ONE IMPROVEMENTS IN STAFFING AND WAGES TO INCREASE FINANCIAL TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND THREE INCREASED OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT FIRST MY COLLEAGUES AND I HAVE CONDUCTED TWO RECENT STUDIES AND CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES SHOWING THAT NURSE STAFFING LEVELS ARE THE MAJOR FACTORS THAT PREVENT COBIT INFECTIONS AND DEATHS HIGHER TOTAL STAFFING HOURS AND ARE IN HOURS REDUCE COVET INFECTION AND DEATH RATES BY HALF WE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S MINIMUM STAFFING STANDARD OF THREE POINT FIVE HOURS PER RESIDENT PER DAY IS SIMPLY TOO LOW TO PROTECT RESIDENTS WE URGE INCREASING THE STATE'S MINIMUM STAFFING LAW TO FOUR POINT ONE HOURS PER RESIDENT DAY FOR TOTAL NURSING INCLUDING FORTY FIVE MINUTES OF OUR IN TIME AND TWENTY FOUR HOUR ARE IN COVERAGE WE ALSO STRONGLY RECOMMEND ELIMINATING ALL STAFFING WAIVERS WHICH ONLY SERVED TO REDUCE AND KEEP WAGES LOW IN ADDITION A WE FOUND THAT NURSING HOMES WITH OVER FIFTY PERCENT TURNOVER RATES HAD THIRTY PERCENT MORE WORDS THIRTY PORT PERCENT MORE LIKELY TO HAVE HIGHER INFECTION RATES WE URGE REQUIRING A FIFTEEN PERCENT INCREASE IN NURSING ASSISTANT WAGES IN THE COMING YEAR TO REDUCE TURNOVER TO REDUCE THE STAFFING SHORTAGES AND PREVENT WORKERS FROM WORKING IN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND TO INCREASE WORK PRODUCTIVITY SECOND EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC CALIFORNIA FOR PROFIT NURSING HOMES HAD FOUR TO FIVE TIMES HIGHER COALBED INFECTION RATES COMPARED TO NON PROFIT AND GOVERNMENT FACILITIES PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SPENDING ADEQUATE AMOUNTS OF DIRECT CARE SERVICES SO WE HAVE TWO RECOMMENDATIONS ONE REQUIRING THAT NURSING HOMES SUBMIT AN ANNUAL CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL REPORT BY A CERTIFIED AUDITOR FOR ALL RELATED PARTY ORGANIZATIONS AND ENTITIES INCLUDING PARENT MANAGEMENT AND PROPERTY COMPANIES AND SECOND ESTABLISHING FINANCIAL LIMITS ON ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND PROFITS ON THE ENTIRE NURSING HOME COMPANY SO THAT THE REMAINING FUNDS CAN BE USED FOR DIRECT CARE SERVICES NEW JERSEY HAS JUST PASSED SUCH A LAW REQUIRING NINETY PERCENT OF EXPENDITURES FOR DIRECT CARE SERVICES THIRD CALIFORNIA HAS A LONG RECORD OF THE WEEK SURVEY AGENCY OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT WE RECOMMEND TWO THINGS ONE ESTABLISHING CLEARER QUALITY CRITERIA FOR ANY NEW OWNER OR ANY CHANGES IN OWNERS OR MANAGEMENT OF NURSING HOMES AND ACTUALLY ENFORCING THESE REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO FORCE A SALE OF FACILITIES TO MORE RESPONSIBLE OWNERS WHEN IT BECOMES NECESSARY AND SECOND STRENGTHENING THE OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT IN ESPECIALLY IN IT AT RISK FOR FACILITIES USING PENALTIES BANS ON ADMISSION AND TEMPORARY MANAGERS AND AT RISK FACILITIES INCLUDE THOSE WITH LOW STAFFING HIGH TURNOVER FOR PROFIT OWNERSHIP LARGE FACILITY SIZE AND FACILITIES WITH HIGH PERCENTAGES OF MINORITY RESIDENTS WITH MALE RESIDENTS AND -- OLDER RESIDENTS FINALLY TO PROVIDE BETTER TOOLS FOR MONITORING OVERSIGHT AND POLICIES WE ALSO RECOMMEND HAVING CD P. H. AN ARCH BREAD ASSORTED TO OBTAIN DATA ON RESIDENT CAN'T CHARACTERISTICS AND PAY ROADS STOPPING FROM CMS AND TO MAKE THESE AVAILABLE PUBLICLY AND TO USE THOSE FOR MONITORING HIGH RISK FACILITIES AND FINALLY ESTABLISHING A CENTER FOR CALIFORNIA NURSING HOME RESEARCH THAT COLLECTS AND INTEGRATES RELEVANT DATA AS SOON AS IT BECOMES AVAILABLE IN ORDER TO DO RAPID CYCLE RESEARCH TO SUPPORT POLICY AND LEGISLATIVE DEVELOPMENTS SO IN CLOSING BY ADDRESSING STAFFING AND WAGES TRANSPARENCY AND OVERSIGHT AND ENFORCEMENT THE LEGISLATURE CAN PROTECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS AND STAFF FROM FURTHER COALBED INFECTIONS AND DEATHS AND AT THE SAME TIME IT CAN TACKLE THESE LONG STANDING QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT CALIFORNIA NURSING HOMES HAVE HAD THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH DR HARRINGTON OUR FINAL SPEAKER WILL BE GREAT CORNETTO CEO PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES MISTER CORNET THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES WE REPRESENT OVER NINE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED INTERMEDIATE CARE FACILITIES FOR THE DEVELOPMENT DISABLED IN CALIFORNIA I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE COMMENTS TODAY AND HOW ABOUT HOW SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE RESPONDING TO THE KOBE PANDEMIC AND THE CONTINUING CHALLENGES WE FACED FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND WHAT IMPROVEMENTS IN STATE REIMBURSEMENT OVERSIGHT AT COULD HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE QUALITY OF PATIENT CARE GOING FORWARD I WANT TO START OUT BY JUST FIRST OF ALL THANKING THE TRIP THE THE WORK FORCE THE TREMENDOUS A TIRELESS WORK FORCE AND ALL HEALTHCARE US LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES IN OUR STATE WHO DO THE BEST EVERY DAY TO KEEP OUR FRAGILE ELDERLY POPULATION SAFE AND PROTECTED CAST MEMBERS AND ALL OF OUR LONG TERM HEALTH CARE WORKERS SHOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR THEIR DEDICATION AND SACRIFICE I ALSO WANT TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ALSO ABOUT THE HOW WE HAVE STEPPED UP TO THE PLATE AND WE ARE SEEING SIGNIFICANT STABILIZATION OF PATIENT CARE THROUGH IMPROVED DETECTION CONTAINMENT AND PREVENTION OF CORONAVIRUS YOU HEARD IT STEIN OCCURRED EARLIER IN THE -- HEARING -- GIVE ME A LATEST IT JUST TAKES THEIR WELL OUTLINED IN PAGES FOUR AND FIVE OF YOUR AGENDA AS WELL AS OF YESTERDAY ARE -- THERE WERE ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED UP POSITIVE RESIDENTS OF RESIDENTS IN SKILLED NURSING LEE OUT OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND FRIENDLY A HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND ABOUT SEVEN HUNDRED POSITIVE RESIDENTS AND ONLY ABOUT EIGHT POSITIVE STAFF OUT OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND STAFF TO THERE'S BEEN TREMENDOUS IMPROVEMENT BUT THERE ARE STILL CHALLENGES THAT REQUIRE CONTINUED STATE SUPPORT GOING FORWARD I'D LIKE TO START OUT BY JUST TELLING YOU LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW AND YOU HEARD SOME OF THIS FROM HEIDI FIRST EACH FACILITY IS REQUIRED TO HAVE AND IT HERE TO A COMPREHENSIVE COBIT NINETEEN MITIGATION PLAN APPROVED AND MONITORED BY CDPH MITIGATION PLANS ARE LIVING DOCUMENTS AND THEIR FREQUENTLY UPDATED TO ADDRESS CURRENT CIRCUMSTANCES BACK AT THE TESTING IS ESSENTIALLY REQUIRED ELEMENT OF OF THE FACILITY PREVENTION AND CONTAINMENT OF COVERT NINETEEN RESIDENTS ARE MONITORED DAILY AND ARE TESTED IF THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO A COPA NINETEEN POSITIVE RESIDENT ARE HEALTHCARE WORKERS ANYONE WITH SYMPTOMS IS NOT ADMITTED AND RESIDENTS AND STAFF SHOWS SHOWING SYMPTOMS ARE TESTED IMMEDIATELY IF RESIDENTS OR STAFF OUR COBIT POSITIVE THEY QUARANTINE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS AND FOLLOW SPECIFIC PROTOCOLS SAID CMS AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND CDPH BOTH REQUIRE WEEKLY TESTING OF STAFF WHICH INCLUDES WHICH GET -- COINCIDES WITH MANY LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL TESTING HAS IMPROVED GREATLY IN RECENT MONTHS AND THE RESULTS ARE COMING BACK MORE QUICKLY CDPH AND TO AND TO SEE A MASS AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN WASHINGTON THIRD SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE USING A VARIETY OF REQUIRED -- PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT PP TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTHCARE WORKERS AND RESIDENTS WITH MANDATORY USE OF GALLONS GLOVES AND MASKS THIS PP IS MUCH BETTER AVAILABLE NOW THAN IT WAS IN PREVIOUS MONTHS AND I WOULD RECOMMEND -- S. B. TWO SEVENTY FIVE WHICH PASSED THIS SESSION WHICH REQUIRE STOCKPILING OF PP TO HAVE IT ON HAND FOR FUTURE PANDEMICS FOURTH FACILITIES HAVE INCREASED INFECTION PREVENTION AND CLEANING EACH FACILITY HAS A CLINICAL STAFF MEMBER WITH ADVANCED TRAINING DESIGNATED FOR INFECTION PREVENTION AND CONTROL THE TRAINS OTHER STAFF ON INFECTION CONTROL PROCEDURES EXTENSIVE CLEANING OF RESIDENT ROOMS COMMON AREAS AND HIGH TOUCH SERVICES HAVE ALSO INCREASED AND THOSE OF HELP REDUCE THE POTENTIAL COVERT EXPOSURE I POINT OUT ALSO -- SIX FOUR FOUR WHICH PASSED THIS YEAR AND REQUIRES EACH FACILITY TO HAVE AN INFECTION PREVENTION NEST ON STAFF WE APPROPRIATE TRAINING FOR ALL STAFF MEMBERS FIFTH NURSING FACILITIES HAVE INCREASED STAFFING HOURS TO ALLOW MORE PERSONALIZED RESIDENT CARE AS IN AS COMMUNAL DINING AND GROUP ACTIVITIES HAVE BEEN CANCELED -- SCREENING TESTING AND REPORTING THE CODE BY RICK SCOBEY STATUS OF RESIDENTS AND STAFF TO MULTIPLE AGENCIES ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL STAFF TIME EVERY EXTRA STAFF TIME IS BEING UTILIZED TO FACILITATE RESIDENT INTERACTION WITH FRIENDS AND LOVED ONES ACTIVITY STAFF HAVE TRANSITION TO PROVIDING ROOM VISITS AND ACTIVITIES TO ENGAGE RESIDENTS AND KEEP THEM AS ACTIVE AS POSSIBLE AND FINALLY I WANT TO MENTION VISITATION HALF MY ORGANIZATION STRONGLY SUPPORTS SAFE VISITATION PRACTICES IF THEY ARE IMPORTANT FOR THE EMOTIONAL WELL BEING AND HEALTH OF OUR RESIDENTS WHETHER IT'S OUTDOOR OR INDOOR GUIDELINES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND BY CDPH THE GUIDELINES DEPEND ON THE POSITIVITY RATE NEEDS COUNTY VISITATION BASED ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS OF THEIR HELD MOST OFTEN OUTDOORS WHENEVER PRACTICAL INDOOR VISITATIONS ALLOWED IF THERE IS NO RESPONSE TESTING OR OUTBREAK VISITS ARE CONDUCTED ARE CONDUCTED ONE OF THE TIME LIMIT IS LIMITED AND VISITS ARE HELD IN THE SINGLE ROOM WERE DESIGNATED AREA THE CORE PRINCIPLES ARE MAINTAINED FOR VISITATION TO OCCUR WHICH INCLUDE SCREENING HAND HYGIENE SOURCE CONTROLLED PHYSICAL DISTANCING AND THE LIKE I WANT TO ALSO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR LOOKING AT THE ISSUE IMPORTANT ISSUES OF OF -- NURSING HOME FINANCING AND THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THE SUPPORT OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET AND EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE THAT BILL CONTAINED IMPORTANT REFORMS TO MEDICARE FINANCING FOR NURSING HOMES AND I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW OF THOSE BUT YOU PASSED THIS YEAR YOU CONTINUE THE COST BASE SPECIFIC A COST BASED FACILITY SPECIFIC A MEDIC CAL RATE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE AND YOU IMPROVE FUNDING FOR DIRECT LABOR COST -- YOU MAY NURSING HOME FACILITIES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE CLOVER NINETEEN RESPONSE AS A CONDITION OF RECEIVING ADDITIONAL INCREASE REIMBURSEMENT YOU'RE SURE THAT THE FEDERAL DOLLARS FOR THE PANDEMIC OR UTILIZED AN AUDITING AUDITED FOR SPECIFIC PANDEMIC COST YOU CREATED THE PENALTIES FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE ADDITIONAL PENALTIES THAT ARE NOT CONFER FACILITIES THAT ARE NOT COMPLIANT WITH STAFFING WAIT REQUIRED OUT BUT I WOULD JUST POINT OUT TO EVEN WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS RECENT BUDGET BILL MEDIC CAL STILL UNDER PAYS NURSING FACILITIES FOR PATIENT CARE THEY PROVIDE THE MEDICARE PROGRAM IS THE PRIMARY PAYER FOR NURSING FACILITIES MAKING UP ABOUT SEVENTY PERCENT OF THE LONG TERM CARE POPULATION THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE IS STRUCTURED WITH SIGNIFICANT COST CONSTRAINTS AND LIMITATIONS FACILITIES ARE INCENTIVIZED TO SPEND MORE DOLLARS ON STAFF WAGES BUT THEY ONLY RECEIVE A PORTION OF THOSE COSTS THE MEDIC HELP PROGRAM AS REIMBURSEMENT DUE TO INHERENT CAPITATION ON FUNDING FOR LABOR THERE ARE SOME FACILITIES HAVE AN ONGOING SHORTAGE OF CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS AS WELL AS LV ENDS AND RN'S THIS HAPPENED LONG BEFORE THE COPA HAS BEEN EXACERBATED WITH THE CHALLENGES AS NORTH AS SKIP AS HEALTHCARE WORKERS -- MAY NEED TO QUARANTINE FOR FOURTEEN DAYS CHILD CARE CONCERNS THE FEAR OF CONTRACTING CO THAT HAVE ALSO MADE THIS MORE DIFFICULT BUT EVEN WITH ALL THIS WE HAVE SEEN GREAT PROGRESS IN IN THE CONTROL THE VIRUS TO LOOK AT IMPROVING STAFFING IN NURSING HOMES THAT'S THEM PAIRED THAT THE STATE BE PREPARED TO ACTUALLY PAY FACILITIES FOR THEIR LABOR COST SO THAT THEY CAN AFFORD THE WAGES NECESSARY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN HEALTH CARE WORKERS IN ADDITION THE STATE NEEDS TO ASSIST FACILITIES IN RECRUITING AND RETAINING OF THE NEEDS OF WORK FORCE -- THROUGH WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FINALLY BEYOND LOOKING AT MORE ADEQUATE MEDICAL HEALTH FINANCING FOR LABOR COST WE WANT TO SUGGEST A COUPLE OF OTHER ITEMS -- GOING FORWARD THAT WOULD HAVE AN IMMEDIATE POSITIVE IMPACT CONTINUING TO PRIORITIZE NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS AND STAFF IN EVERYTHING THAT THE STATE DOES OF THIS WILL INCLUDE THE VACCINE THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE VACCINE AND I CAN TALK MORE ABOUT THAT AND THE QUESTIONS THERE'S A LOT OF POSITIVE THINGS HAPPENING AT TO PREPARE FOR THE VACCINE INCREASING THE ACCESS OF NURSING FACILITIES TO TESTING KITS THAT PROVIDE TIMELY RESULTS ALTHOUGH TESTING IS GETTING BETTER THERE ARE STILL HURDLES AND COST CONSTRAINTS ALSO I JUST WANTED TO MENTION A FEW OTHER THINGS FOR THE PURPOSES OF ITS EXISTING AND PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY ALSO RIGHT NOW THERE IS NO CLEAR WEBSITE WHERE ANYONE CAN ACCESS ALL FEDERAL STATE REQUIREMENTS AND LOCAL REQUIREMENTS IN ONE PLACE WE HAVE URGED THE STATE TO DIVERT TO DEVELOP SUCH SUCH A UP A PORTAL SO EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING AT ONCE IN ONE PLACE A DEDICATED PP FOR SKILLED NURSING HOME CARE WORKERS IT'S GOING TO BE IMPORTANT GOING FORWARD AS WE WILL SEE GAPS PROBABLY CONTINUE IN THE AVAILABILITY OF EQUIPMENT AND LASTLY BUT NO LESS IMPORTANT THE STATE MUST PROVIDE FUNDING FOR NURSING FACILITIES TO COVER THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT LIABILITY AND WORKERS COMP RATES DUE TO THE PANDEMIC NURSING FACILITIES RATES ARE SKYROCKETING FOR PANDEMIC COVERAGE AND WHAT IT AND THAT WHEN THEY ARE LUCKY ENOUGH TO EVEN BE ABLE TO FIND INSURANCE COVERAGE IN MOST CASES -- FACILITIES ARE NOT FINDING CHARACTER CARRIERS THAT WILL COVER THEIR LIABILITY OR THEIR WORKERS COMP RISK RELATED TO COPE WITH THE LAST POINT I JUST WANNA MAKE THIS CHAIRMAN OTHERS IS SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE NOT ISLANDS THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE PROVISION OF PROFESSION IS STILL LEARNING A LOT ABOUT THE DISEASE HOW IT SPREADS AND HOW TO CONTAIN IT UNFORTUNATELY NEITHER SNIFFS IN OUR HOSPITALS OUR ISLANDS AND WE ARE ALL PART OF THE COMMUNITY OUR COMMUNITIES OUR EMPLOYEES LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY AS TO THE VENDORS AS TWO PHYSICIANS AND SPECIALISTS AND OTHERS WHEN VISITING RAMPS UP WE WILL HAVE FAMILY MEMBERS FROM THE COMMUNITY TO FACILITIES THAT HAVE TAKEN AGGRESSIVE PREVENTIONS PRACTICES BUT THEY ARE NOT ISOLATED AND WHAT HAPPENS IN THE COMMUNITY FREQUENTLY FINDS ITS WAY INTO BUILDINGS EVEN WITH THE MOST AGGRESSIVE PREVENTION PRACTICES THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD QUESTION FROM THE COMMITTEE MISTER MONTE I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR THE CDPH FORGET MISS STEIN OCCURRED -- BACK OTHERS YOU YEAH I AM BACK THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO I KNOW THAT WE ALL SHARE A CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE LACK OF VISITATION HAS HAD ON THE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PSYCHOLOGICAL HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS OF THESE FACILITIES SO I'M WONDERING IF THE CDPH HAS SOME DATA ON THOSE STATISTICS -- AND EFFECTIVE IS THE LACK OF THE STATIONS HAD ON THEM I BECAUSE I HAVE NOT -- I'VE NOT SEEN ANY DATA ON THAT THANK YOU SENT I WE HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM -- TO LOOK AT DATA -- ONE OF THE PARTNERSHIPS THAT WE'VE HAD WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT AGING IS WORKING WITH -- I'M BUDS MEANT TO FIND -- ARE THEIR CONCERNS I'M FOR THOSE THAT EITHER HAPPENED BACK IN ITS FACILITIES OR WE ARE ALSO PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE OMBUDSMAN SO THAT THEY CAN GET INTO THE FACILITIES -- AND SEE IF WE CAN GO ON OUT ANY TYPES OF QUALITY OF CARE DATA EXCEPT TRUCK -- WE ALSO WHEN WE GO INTO FACILITIES AS LICENSE WE'RE NOT JUST LOOKING AND FACTION PREVENTION WHEN WE'RE THERE WE'RE LOOKING TO SEE ARE THERE ISSUES WITH QUALITY OF CARE OTHER ISSUES WITH LEADERSHIP OTHER ISSUES WITH -- WITH NUTRITION AND THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CITATIONS THAT WE'VE GIVEN THROUGHOUT -- THE COURSE THE PANDEMIC OR HAD TO TAKE EVEN MORE AGGRESSIVE OPTIONS MANAGERS -- OR DOING -- ARE REVOCATION EXCEPT TRACK ON TO THOSE SITUATIONS BUT ONE OF THE THINGS THAT DOES GIVE ME A LITTLE BIT OF HOPE -- AFTER ABOUT WHAT ARE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS OF SOME OF THIS ISOLATION AS WE WERE LOOKING AT OVERALL MORTALITY RATE TO SEE IF THE OVERALL MORTALITY RATE IS HIGHER THIS YEAR -- AND THEN LAST YEAR OR IN PREVIOUS YEARS AND LOOKING AT WHAT THE EFFECTS OF YOU KNOW COPD MORTALITY VERSUS OVERALL MORTALITY -- WE ARE SEEN LOW RATES AND LOWER RATES OF MORTALITY IN OUR AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES COULD BE BECAUSE THE INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES ARE SO MUCH GREATER NOW THAT PERHAPS -- PEOPLE ARE NOT EXPOSED TO OTHER POTENTIAL YOU KNOW AS COMMUNICABLE DISEASES WITH THEN AND AND OTHER THINGS THAT CAN CAN HAPPEN -- BUT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT THERE AREN'T ISSUES WE ARE TRACKING WHAT TYPES OF COMPLAINTS WERE RECEIVING AS WELL AS FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENCES ON AND MOST OF OUR COMPLAINTS AROUND THIS TATIAN -- AND AS I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS A FACTOR IS THAT WHEN WE ISSUED AND RE OPENED FACILITIES ON JUNE TWENTY SIX -- THE STATE MIGHT HAVE YOU KNOW SAID HEY WE'RE REOPENING REQUIRING VISITATION BUT MANY LOCAL CUT CUT PUBLIC AND HEALTH OFFICERS HAD MORE STE -- STRICTER LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH ORDERS THAT RESTRICTED ON BUSSMANN -- WOULD RESTRICT VISITATION ON AND SO WHEN THOSE CAME OUT -- WE THEN STARTED TO MEET WITH PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ONE ON ONE TALK THROUGH WHAT THE CONCERNS WERE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT ISOLATION AND OF COURSE THEY DO AS WELL BUT WE'RE TRYING TO PARTNER TOGETHER ON THE SCIENCE AND USING SCIENCE BASED PRACTICES TO SAY HEY VISITATION SHOULD BE A REQUIREMENT IS IS PATIENT RIGHT -- AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE C. PROTOCOL TO DO SO SO THAT'S WHY BEFORE WE ISSUE THE SECOND VISITATION AFL TO RE OPENED FURTHER WE DID A DIFFERENT PRACTICE WE FIRST MET WITH ALL THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS ASKED FOR THEIR FEEDBACK AND SO WHEN WE ISSUE THAT ON FRIDAY OUR HOPE IS THAT OVER THE NEXT WEEK OR SO WE HOPE THAT THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH STRICTER GUIDELINES WELL NOW WITH THE STATE RE OPENING BUT AGAIN WITH SAFE PRACTICES AND PROTOCOLS THAT WE HAVE LISTED OUT IN OUR POLICY THANK YOU ARE THE REASON I RAISE THE ISSUE IS THAT I HAVE HAD PERSONAL CONTACT FROM QUITE A FEW CONSTITUENTS BUT I'M SURE PROBABLY EVERYONE ON THIS DíAS HAS WELL VERY CONCERNED ABOUT LOVED ONES THAT ARE IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THAT THEY ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH VISITATION WITH AND -- I DO NOT SHARE YOUR CONFIDENCE THAT THE ABRIDGEMENT ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO HIGHLIGHT THE EXTENT OF THIS EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL PROBLEMS BECAUSE THE DATA THAT I HAVE SAYS THAT WE HAD ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND A BUNCH BEEN VISITS TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES A YEAR AGO IN OCTOBER AND THAT THIS MONTH IT'S BEEN AROUND A THOUSAND SO I'M CONCERNED THAT WE MIGHT NOT BE GETTING THE FULL PICTURE OF HOW PERVASIVE THIS PROBLEM IS AND I KNOW THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT SO I DON'T HAVE TO ASK IF WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT THERE IS PROBABLY A PROTOCOL THE CAN BE ESTABLISHED THAT THAT -- ENHANCES VISITATION WHILE STILL PROTECTING THE HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS OF THE FACILITY A GREAT GREAT ALSO MY SECOND QUESTION IS ABOUT THE STATE'S VA FACILITIES VERY LARGE POPULATION IN THEIR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE'VE HAD ANY MAJOR COVERT OUTBREAKS IN THOSE FACILITIES AND I WONDER IF YOU CAN TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THAT IS AND WHAT IT WHAT DISPARITIES MIGHT EXIST BETWEEN THE VA AND THE OTHER SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN THE STATES BECAUSE I FOUND THAT VERY ODD THAT'S AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION -- ABOUT THE THAT THE ACE I CAN TAKE THAT BACK AND LOOK MORE INTO THAT DETAIL BECAUSE I WANT TO BE ABLE TO PULL THAT TO PULL THE DATA ON THAT TO SEE BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION AT THIS TIME TO BE ABLE TO KIND OF SPEAK TO WHY THAT MAY BE A WAY THAT NOT BE IT MAY BE -- BUT I WILL DEFINITELY TAKE THAT BACK IS IT IS IT SOMETHING TO LOOK INTO FOR OUR ANALYTICS OKAY WELL THANK YOU AND IF YOU CAN CALL MY OFFICE ON THAT I I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THAT YEAH NOW THAT IS INTERESTING THAT AND IF THERE MIGHT BE SOME GOOD LESSONS LEARNED THERE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THOSE FACILITIES ARE DOING SOMETHING RIGHT IF WE'RE NOT SEEING THE SAME DEGREE OF OPERATE THERE IS WE ARE ELSEWHERE THANK YOU THANK YOU NEXT GRAB THE DOCTOR REGULAR THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND -- IF I COULD I WANT TO START -- WITH THE THANK YOU AS WELL TO MONEY ACKERMAN WHO HAD GOTTEN INFECTED WHILE WORKING IN A SNAP I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES HAVING BEEN A PROVIDER MYSELF I UNDERSTAND AND APPRECIATE WHAT PANDEMIC FATIGUE LOOKS LIKE AND OFTEN TIMES THAT'S WHEN WE DON'T START APPRECIATING THOSE WERE WORKING SO HARD RIGHT NOW SO MARIA CARMEN I JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE YOU FELT IT FROM US HERE ON THE DIESS THAT WE'RE HERE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP TO SUPPORT YOU BUT I DID WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT CREEK CORNETT SAID BECAUSE HE SAID WE DON'T HAVE A CNA PROBLEM OR WE DID HAVE A CNA PROBLEM BEFORE WE STARTED THIS PANDEMIC AND I THINK WE REALLY HAVE TO LOOK TOWARDS WAYS WE CAN SUPPORT OUR WORK FORCE BE A RETENTION OR RECRUITMENT AND WANTED TO HEAR FROM YOU REGARDING THE WORK FORCE DEVELOPMENT THAT YOU SPOKE ABOUT AND THEN IF I CAN I'M GOING TO BE QUEUING UP NICOLE HOW OLD TO COME UP AND SPEAK ABOUT THE HEALTH CARE PATHWAYS THAT SHE REFERENCED IN HER COMMENTARY SO IF WE COULD START WITH CRANK CORNET ONE YES YES BANK THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA THE WORK FORCE IS WORKFORCE IT'S SO IMPORTANT TO THE SECTOR BUT IT'S NOT JUST US IT'S ALL PRETTY MUCH EVERYONE IN THE ENTIRE HEALTHCARE SECTOR RIGHT NOW WORKFORCE IS A MAJOR ISSUE -- I WAS A MEMBER OF THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STAKEHOLDER GROUP THAT IS JUST FINISH AT WORK AND THERE'S A MAJOR SECTION THERE ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT THIS IS GOING TO TAKE ALMOST A NATIONAL OR OUR STATE STATEWIDE EFFORT IN TERMS OF TRAINING BRINGING IN MORE HEALTHCARE WORKERS ESPECIALLY C. N. A.'S BUT REALLY IN THE NURSING AND AND THE LPN AND RN -- AREAS AS WELL -- AND YOU'VE ALSO HEARD TODAY THAT THE SOME OF THE IDEAS OF PUTTING MORE MONEY IN FOR PAY FACILITIES WOULD LOVE VERY MUCH TO BE ABLE TO PAY MORE BUT AT THIS POINT THERE THEY WILL NEED TO HAVE INCREASES IN RATES TO DO THAT -- THEY'RE JUST THEY'RE JUST NOT ENOUGH MONEY IN THE SYSTEM TO DO THAT -- I KNOW THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- RIGHT NOW AND RIGHT NOW AS WELL I WOULD JUST POINT OUT CALF FOR EXAMPLE WE HAD A -- A GRANT RECENTLY TO ESTABLISH MORSE FACILITY BASED WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT WAS VERY SUCCESSFUL BUT WE ARE SO FAR BEHIND THE CURVE ON THAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE IT'S GONNA TAKE A WHILE THE NOTION OF BEING ABLE TO INCREASE THE WORKFORCE IN A REALLY FAST WAY IS I THINK IT'S VERY DAY DIFFICULT TO MATCH BECAUSE THE STATE AND IN THIS QUESTION WILL BE DIRECTED TOWARDS -- THE STATE BUT WHAT HAVE WE EVER LOOKED AT ANY OUTRAGE OR PR CAMPAIGNS THAT MAY HELP US TO RECRUIT MORE PEOPLE INTO CNA'S -- I THINK IT'S PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT NOW AS WE LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OF OUR STATE TO BE PROVIDING PATHWAYS FOR MANY PEOPLE WHO MAY HAVE CULTURAL OR LINGUISTIC COMPETENCIES HI THIS IS A SENATOR FROM CALIFORNIA PART OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WE HAVE ACTUALLY PUT INTO PLACE I'M TAKING A LOOK AT ALL THE DATA BASE FROM PREVIOUS CNA'S THAT WE HAVE AND TRYING TO MATCH THEM TO FACILITIES WHERE WE SAY THAT THERE ARE OPENINGS WE KNOW THAT THERE'S REGION'S THAT NEED MORE STAFFING -- WE'VE DONE SOME CREATIVE THINGS AROUND THAT AROUND THE PANDEMIC BUT WHEN IT COMES TO -- KIND OF PR CAMPAIGNS I'M ONE OF THE THINGS I WOULD LOVE TO WORK WITH SOME OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS I'M PARTICULARLY AND I'M I'M CHARLENE AND I WANT TO TALK TO NICOLE HOW AFTER THIS -- TO KNOW MORE ABOUT WHAT THEIR PROGRAM DOES BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS I'VE NOTICED THAT WE NEED TO DO AS A STATE IS EVEN PARTNER BEYOND PUBLIC HEALTH BUT PARTNER WOULD LOVE TO PARTNER WITH DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION -- AND START TO PROVIDE VOCATIONAL EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES -- MUCH LIKE WE USED TO YOU KNOW DECADES AGO -- IN EVEN K.

THE END OF OUR ENDED FACILITIES TO AND THE NEED IS ONLY GOING TO GROW I WANT TO APPRECIATE YOUR -- ANSWER AND IF I CAN I WANT TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY STAFF I THINK YOU ARE SETTING AN EXAMPLE THAT MANY OF US WILL WANT TO LOOK AT AND SEE IF THERE'S POTENTIAL FOR US TO SCALE AND SO WOULD REALLY LIKE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE INFORMATION -- WELLNESS DINERS COMING TO THE -- MICROPHONE I I WILL JUST COMMENT THAT THE GRAPH ON PAGE FOUR AND NOTICED SOME CORRELATION BETWEEN WENT ON FUNDS MAN WENT BACK INTO FACILITIES AND WE START NOTICING IMPROVEMENTS BUT WANTED TO JUST APPRECIATE YOU MISS STEIN OCCUR FOR THE SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN BOTH CASES AND MORTALITY IT'S IMPRESSIVE WHAT WERE LOOKING HARD AND JUST WANTS TO MAKE SURE YOU HEAR THAT FROM THOSE OF US HERE ON THE DYESS BUT I WANT TO TURN TO PAGE FIFTEEN IF I CAN AND IN THAT THERE IS DISCUSSIONS REGARDING -- FLU VACCINATIONS FOR SNIFF WORKFORCE AND STAFF AND SO MISDIAGNOSIS HOPING TO SPEAK WITH YOU IF I COULD THERE ARE ESTABLISHED NATIONAL GOALS FOR SMITH'S TO HAVE NINETY PERCENT COVERAGE OF THIS NETWORK FORCING STAFF AND I'M WONDERING WHAT IS CALIFORNIA'S CURRENT WORK FOR STAFF FLU VACCINATION COVERAGE SO CRAIG CORNET MAY PERHAPS BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT MORE INSIGHT TO THIS AS WELL AS WE'VE BEEN TALKING MOST RECENTLY ABOUT FLU COVERAGE I AM AND I BELIEVE IT'S IN THE MID NINETIES -- LAST -- THAT I HAD HEARD -- SO CRAIG OF IT'S JUST IF CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BECAUSE I KNOW THAT YOU HAD TO STOP YES IT'S IN THE UPPER NINETIES ACTUALLY FOR FOR FOR FLU VACCINATION FOR RESIDENTS FOR STAFF IT'S NOT QUITE AS HIGH BUT THE WAY THE RULES OF WORK OVER THE YEARS FOR FLU VACCINATION FOR STAFF IS IT IF STAFF DO NOT REFUSE TO HAVE A A FAX A VACCINATION THEY HAVE TO WEAR ADDITIONAL PP AND MASS WRAP THE ENTIRE FLU SEASON THIS IS GOING TO BE A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION GOING FORWARD NOW OBVIOUSLY ON THE KOBE BAXEEN BUT THE REST OF THE THE VACCINATION FOR FOR RESIDENTS IS IN THE UPPER NINETY PERCENT AND THAT GIVES ME COMFORT CRAIG BECAUSE -- IN THE AGENDA IT HIGHLIGHTS THAT APPROXIMATELY SIXTY PERCENT NATIONALLY IS WHAT THE AVERAGES FOR WORK FORCE OF CALIFORNIA IS LEADING THE WAY ON THAT I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I'M FINAL QUESTION IF I CAN FROM THE STEIN OCCUR AND -- I'M I AM TRYING TO THINK A STEP AHEAD AND -- IF NOT IF WHEN WE HAVE A COVERT NINETEEN VACCINE I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE A DISCUSSION ABOUT PRIORITIZATION AND I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT CONVERSATION FOR US TO THINK ABOUT SHOULD WE BE PUSHING OUR FIRST RESPONDERS TO THE FRONT OF THE LINE BUT I BELIEVE WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK TOWARDS OUR CONGREGATE CARE SETTINGS ARE SNAPS AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR YOUR THOUGHTS ON WHETHER OR NOT AND KOPEN VACCINATIONS WELL ABSOLUTELY AND -- WE DO HAVE A A VACCINE WORK FORCE TASK FORCE RIGHT NOW -- THAT IS LOOKING AT ALL THE PRIORITIZATION IS ACROSS ALL OF OUR HEALTH CARE FACILITIES AS WELL AS LOOKING AT WHO ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS -- THE VACCINE OBVIOUSLY MANY OF THE DIFFERENT OPTIONS OF VACCINES RIGHT NOW -- DO PRESENT SOME CHALLENGES -- FOR EXAMPLE EVEN THE FIZER VACCINE THAT HAS TO BE -- STORED AT SUB SEVENTY DEGREES -- AND THEN CAN ONLY HAVE LIKE A TWELVE HOUR THOUGHT TIME BEFORE THEN YOU CAN -- YOU KNOW VACCINATE OTHERWISE IT'S A LONGER EFFICACIOUS -- SOME HAVE THERE IS LEVELS OF EFFICACY FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF POPULATIONS INCLUDING -- MANY WHO WOULD RESIDE IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY -- AND SO I THINK THE IMPORTANT MESSAGE THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO COME OUT VERY STRONGLY AND CLEARLY IS MUCH LIKE WE HAVE HAD -- COME CAMPAIGNS AND INFORMATION ABOUT HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT YOU MASK EVEN IF YOU'RE YOUNG TWENTY THIRTY HEALTHY YEAR OLD YOU KNOW OUT THERE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT YOU ABIDE AND YOUR DECISIONS AND WEARING A MASK IN WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO DO TO REMAIN PHYSICALLY DISTANCE AND NOT DO THESE HUGE GATHERINGS AND AND SUCH THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS -- ARE SKILLED NURSING RESIDENTS AND OUR MOST VULNERABLE AND SO MUCH LIKE WITH VACCINES -- YOU KNOW WE ENCOURAGE VACCINES FOR ALL AGES IN ORDER TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ON THE VACCINE MIGHT NOT BE AS EFFICACIOUS FOR SO IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE KIND OF LOOK AT IT NOT JUST FROM A PRIORITY TO GET THE VACCINE BUT ALSO I'M HAVING VERY STRONG -- PUBLIC -- SERVICE ANNOUNCEMENTS NOT NONSENSE OUT THERE ABOUT WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT THAT EVERYONE CHOOSES THINGS LIKE VACCINES AND -- AND MASCHINEN PHYSICAL DISTANCING TO PROTECT THOSE -- WHO THEY MIGHT NOT BE A -- THEY MIGHT HAVE INTERACTION WITH THANK YOU FOR DOCTOR REGULAR IF I COULD ADD ON TO THE VACCINE ISSUE IN THE LAST WEEK THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND WASHINGTON HAS ANNOUNCED A PRIORITY ITS PRIORITIZATION FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FACTS THE IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND TIER ONE AND THE VERY FIRST PRIORITY IS GOING TO BE SKILLED NURSING RESIDENTS CONGREGATE CARE RESIDENTS AND STAFF THE STATE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CDC HAS ALREADY ESTABLISHED A PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM TO DISTRIBUTE THE VACCINES AND COME TO THE FACILITIES TO VACCINATE PRESIDENT AS SOON AS THE -- VACCINE IS AVAILABLE AND SAFE AND READY TO GO THAT'S GOING TO BE A HUGE LEAP FORWARD THE STATE WILL BE WORKING WITH FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH THAT THE HOW THEY'RE GOING TO ROLL OUT THE VACCINE FOR THAT FOR HEALTHCARE WORKERS BUT BUT THIS IS WHAT THIS IS WELL UNDERWAY IT IS THAT CAN BE A DAUNTING CHALLENGES YOU CAN IMAGINE AND WE DON'T KNOW WHICH VACCINE IS GOING TO BE THE THE MOST EFFICACIOUS AT THIS POINT SOME HAVE TO BE WAS STORED AT MINUS EIGHTY DEGREES BUT THE THE FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO COME IN TO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TO VACCINATE THE RESIDENTS WILL HAVE ALL OF THAT THEY'LL HAVE THE PP THEY'LL BE ABLE TO DO THOSE VACCINATIONS WE'RE VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU KNOW WE HAVE MISTER FOR HAD SOME QUESTIONS I YES US FOR HAVING THIS -- HEARING UP I GUESS MY FIRST -- GOOD QUESTIONS WILL BE TWO MISSED AND -- THANK YOU FOR ALL YOUR ASSISTANCE FOR US IN THE CENTER VALLEY I THINK HE AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC WE HAD A NUMBER OF CONGREGATE HOTSPOTS -- AND YOU WERE VERY INSTRUMENTAL IN HELPING WITH A NUMBER OF FACILITIES ESPECIALLY KERN COUNTY UNTIL EIGHT -- I DO WANT TO ASK THOUGH IN TERMS OF IT AS YOU AS YOU'VE LEARNED A NUMBER OF LESSONS TO THE PANDEMIC ARE THERE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE COORDINATION BETWEEN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THE COUNTY -- PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS AND -- WE ASK AND THE STATE I KNOW THAT THE AT LEAST MY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN DEALING WITH ONE FACILITY -- TIME IS OF THE ESSENCE AND AS AN OUTBREAK IS HAPPENING WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE IF WE NEED TO MOVE RESIDENTS OUT IF WE NEED TO TEST -- IMMEDIATELY WE HAVE -- WE HAD A CLEARLY AND IN THE SITUATION KERN COUNTY AND THE FACILITY WAS CODE POSITIVE -- AND THERE SEEM TO BE KIND OF LIKE IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A DELAY AND AND AND TRYING TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE ISSUES AND THEN EVENTUALLY -- IT WAS PROBABLY OF A FORTY EIGHT TO SEVENTY TWO HOUR TIME TRYING TO MAYBE UNDERSTAND MAYBE LESSONS YOU'VE LEARNED AND HOW YOU KIND OF ADDRESS THAT IF AT ALL ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION IN FACT THAT THE SCENARIO YOU ARE -- PAINTING OR ONE OF THE VERY FIRST OUTBREAKS THAT I RECALL FROM TO BE ABLE TO CREATE A AND A MORE RESILIENT AND AND MORE AT A QUICK I TURN AROUND WHEN IT CAME TO INTERVENTION AFTER ONE OF THOSE OUTBREAKS ACTUALLY THAT YOU SPOKE OF THIS ACTUALLY WHEN WE STARTED TO DO THE PREDICTIVE ANALYTICS IN CREATING AND URGENT NEEDS DASHBOARD THAT SERVES AS OUR HIGH ALERT SYSTEM WHICH HAS BEEN REALLY HELPFUL AND EFFECTIVE -- BUT TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT WHAT ARE WE THINKING FOR GOING FORWARD BECAUSE I AM EXPECTING A SECOND WAVE I'M SEEN EUROPE HAVE A SECOND WAVE AND SEEN THE EAST COAST OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES -- HAVING THEIR SECOND WAVE I WOULD MINDFUL THAT WE HAVE FLU SEASON I'M MINDFUL THAT WE HAVE MANY HOLIDAYS WHERE WE KNOW THAT MAYBE NOT EVERYONE IS GOING TO COMPLY WITH YOU KNOW JUST IN SEEN IN MASKING -- AND SO WITH THAT I AM ONE OF THE INITIATIVES THAT WE'RE WORKING ON RIGHT NOW IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR HOSPITALS AND OUR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND OUR LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH IS WE ARE PUTTING TOGETHER WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO CALL OUR OUR SEARCH PLANNING -- AROUND SEARCH PATIENT THROUGHPUT SYSTEM FOR YOUR COUNTY AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I NOTICED BACK IN AUGUST WHEN I WAS TRAVELING CENTRAL VALLEY AND MEETING WITH COUNTIES IS THAT I FOUND THAT SOME COUNTIES DID A GREAT JOB OF MEETING WITH THEIR SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND A GREAT JOB MARKET MEETING WITH THEIR HOSPITALS BUT IT WAS VERY RARE THAT I WOULD SEE COUNTIES THAT HAD JOINT -- WEEKLY MEETINGS WITH THEIR ENTIRE WHAT I WOULD CALL HEALTHCARE DELIVERY CONTINUE ONE LOOKING AT ALL OF THE TRANSFER DISCHARGE READMIT ISSUES THAT CAN HAPPEN -- ON A DAILY BASIS AND THESE ARE LONGSTANDING ISSUES THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE PROBABLY THEIR WAY BEFORE -- YOU KNOW CALL THAT THAT OF COURSE EXACERBATED BY KOPET AND SO WE ARE WORKING ON ALL FACILITIES LETTER PROVIDING BEST GUIDANCE AND LESSONS LEARNED THAT WE HAD FROM THE FIRST WAVE ON IT WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS AND HAVING SOME CONCRETE GUIDANCE AROUND TRANSFER AND DISCHARGE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND GO BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN NURSING FACILITIES AS WELL AS READMIT PROCESSES WHEN IS IT SAFE TO RE ADMIT WHEN IS IT NOT BE SO -- SAFE -- THE OTHER THING IS SETTING UP YOUR ALTERNATIVE CARE SITES WITH A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED FROM WHAT WOULD BE BEST USE OF YOUR OFFICER ALTERNATIVE CARE SITE AND AS WELL AS HOW TO BEST USE YOUR EXISTING SPACE -- WHICH IS ACTUALLY THE SAFEST SPACE TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUT IN ALLOWS YOU TO FLEX STAFFING USER STUFF MOST WISELY AND SO WE HAD A LOT OF LESSONS LEARNED THAT FIRST WAVE THAT WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO CODIFY IN WRITING AND THEN BE ABLE TO SHARE IT -- I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH AND -- CAST NCHA THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION SO BRING THE HOSPITALS AND THE TOGETHER TO COME TO CONSENSUS ON WHAT THIS IS ALONG WITH ARCHITECTS DISEASE STOCKS AND NOW WE'RE AT THE POINT WILL BE SHARING IT THE NEXT WEEK -- WITH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS FOR THEIR FEEDBACK AND ONCE WE HAVE THEIR FEEDBACK ON AND THEIR INSIGHTS FROM THE COUNTY LEVEL THEN WE WILL BE ISSUING OUT THIS GUIDANCE AS WELL AS THAT DOING A WEAPON ARE -- FOR BOTH OUR FACILITIES AND OUR OUR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS OKAY I APPRECIATE I MEAN I I WAS JUST THINKING THAT IT IS FROM THAT EXPERIENCE I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE A STRIKE TEAM WOULD BE SENT FIRST AS WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH A NUMBER OF THINGS I KNOW THAT WHEN IT NURSING FACILITY HAS A STAFFING ISSUE THEY GO TO THE COUNTY THE COUNTY THEN TRIES TO FIND STAFF IF THEY CAN'T FIND OUT IF THAT THERE ARE SOME FACILITY AND THIS THAT AND THE COUNTY CAN'T FIND STAFF THEN THEY GO TO YOU AND THEN ENFORCE I HAVE ALL THOSE THINGS ARE EXHAUSTED THEN YOU SENT A STRIKE TEAM I WAS THINKING THAT MAYBE WE REVERSED IT AND SENT A STRIKE TEAM TO STABILIZE EVERYTHING AND THEN I WORK OUT ALL THE OTHER ISSUES ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU KNOW TWENTY FOUR HOURS OR FORTY HOURS IS OF THE S. AND WE HAVE DONE THAT EXACTLY WHAT YOU SAID WE HAVE REVERSED IT WHEN IT WHEN THE SITUATION WARRANTED IT SO WITH THAT URGENT NEEDS DASHBOARD IF WE CALL WE CONTACTED THE WE REALIZE WELL THIS ISN'T URGENT URGENT NEED IT'S NOT ABOUT CALLING A REGISTRY IT'S NOT ABOUT GOING TO YOUR MAILBOX ESTIMATE IANS WE NEED TO SEND AN APPOINTMENT WE DO SENATE APPOINTMENT WE HAVE TEAMS OF EITHER NATIONAL GUARD CAL MATT AND HEALTH CORE THAT WILL SEND AND STABILIZE THE SITUATION WHATEVER -- WHATEVER THE ROOT CAUSE OF WHAT THAT EMERGENCY SITUATION WAS PERFECT AND THEN IN TERMS OF -- WHAT TRIGGERS AN IN PERSON SURVEY ASSESSMENT IT WHEN YOU TRACK THE NUMBERS THAT I'M SURE OF AS WE GET YOU'VE CREATED THIS REAL TIME DOES THAT WHEN SOMETHING OCCURS WHEN YOU SEE SOMETHING DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY -- SEND YOU OUT YOU AUTOMATICALLY SEND A TEAM TO TO DO AN ASSESSMENT OR IS IT A CASE BY CASE BASIS OR HOW DOES THAT WORK WHEN HOW DO YOU DETERMINE WHEN YOU WHEN YOU SEND SOMEONE NO GREAT QUESTION SO WE HAVE A DASHBOARD THAT WE MONITOR AND SEVEN DAYS A WEEK -- OBVIOUSLY IS REPORTED TO -- THEY HAVE TO ENTER IN THEIR DATA IN AZAR DATA COMES IN REAL TIME IT GETS CORRELATED WITH OTHER HIGH RISK INDICATOR DATA THAT WE HAVE COMPILED WE -- COMPARE IT WITH -- THE PAST THREE YEARS OF COMPLIANCE STATUS THAT THEY'VE HAD ANY INFECTION CONTROL ANY CITATIONS THE LAST THREE YEARS THAT GETS PUT IN THE ALGORITHM ANY OUTBREAKS WITHIN A FIVE MILE RADIUS ANY WE'RE GOING TO BE ADDING AS A SAID RECENT FLU DATA -- WE PUT IN ANYONE THAT HAS A STAFFING WAIVER THAT'S CONSIDERED HIGH RISK ANYONE WHO'S HAVING THEIR VERY FIRST CASE EVEN IF IT'S JUST ONE CASE AND IT'S EITHER RESIDENT OR STAFF THAT TRIGGERS US TO IMMEDIATELY GO IN AS WELL BECAUSE WE HAVE FOUND THAT EVEN THOUGH SOMEONE HAS THE BEST LAID PLANS AND WE'VE APPROVED NOT JUST REVIEWED BUT APPROVED THEIR THEIR MITIGATION PLANS WE HAVE ALSO ALSO FOUND THAT IN THAT FIRST TWENTY FOUR HOURS OF GETTING THAT FIRST CASE -- THEY WILL EITHER -- GO WITH THEIR PLANS INTO THEIR PLANS AND EXECUTE THEM PERFECTLY OR THERE COULD BE A FIGHT OR FLIGHT SITUATION WHERE YOU KNOW FEAR OR PEOPLE START TO CALL IN OR THERE COULD BE OTHER ISSUES THAT HAPPENED SO -- THAT'S WHY EVEN JUST HAVING ONE BRAND NEW CASE THAT WORD SET AN IMMEDIATE VISIT AND ENTER INTERVENTION OKAY SO THE OTHER HIGH RISK IT'S ON OUR WEBSITE WE HAVE LOTS OF DIFFERENT HIGH RISK INDICATORS THAT WE'VE ADDED AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADD IN ONE OF THE THINGS THAT JUST RECENTLY HAPPENED AS WE RECENTLY FOUND THAT THERE WERE SOME CITATIONS ARE ROOT CAUSES OF FOR EXAMPLE THEIR STAFF AND THAT'S A CAL OSHA REAGAN SO WHAT WE'RE DOING NOW IS SEEN OKAY WE HAVE ACCESS TO OUR COMPLIANCE DATA BUT IF WE CAN PARTNER ACROSS DIFFERENT DEPARTMENTS TO SEE WHAT OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES THAT ARE ALSO IN THESE FACILITIES IF WE CAN PARTNER AND SHARE ALL OTHER COMPLIANCE DATA THAT WOULD ALSO BE A HIGH RISK INDICATOR TO BE ABLE TO INTERVENE PERFECT AND THEN IN TERMS OF MY LAST QUESTION TO YOU -- AND AND MAYBE -- AND CRACK AND JUMP INTO IS A CONCERN ABOUT TESTING WE CERTAINLY STARTED EARLY WENT AND AND USE CARES OUT BASELINE -- AND THEN OF COURSE NOW THERE'S A GUIDANCE THAT EVERY WHAT EVERY WEEK -- STATUS TESTED AND THEN -- IF THERE'S NO SIT AT THEIR SITUATION IS IT AND AND PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG -- WHAT IS OUR STATUS OF TESTING KITS FOR -- RESIDENTS AND STAFF I KNOW THAT WE WERE KIND OF SHORT I MEAN WE WE KIND OF WERE SHORTAGE OF TESTING KITS IN THE MIDDLE THE PANDEMIC AND THEN AND NOW LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE ENOUGH IS THAT TRUE DO WE HAVE ENOUGH TO DO TESTING ON A REGULAR BASIS TO MEET THE ONE WEEK TWO WEEK TURNAROUND YEAH WE DO WE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE WEEKLY TESTING IN CALIFORNIA -- SO WE ARE I WOULD SAY VERY AGGRESSIVE IN CALIFORNIA WITH THEIR TESTING CMS -- -- DID NOT STATE THAT TESTING WEEKLY WAS NECESSARY IN ALL COUNTIES BUT WE FELT TO BE MORE PREVENTIVE GOING INTO THE WINTER SEASON WE REQUIRE THAT EVERYONE TOSSED OUT WEEKLY BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE THE CAPACITY FOR THAT SAID THIS WEEK ALSO ACTUALLY NOVEMBER FIRST WE RE OPEN OR WE WILL BE OPENING OUR FIRST STATE RUN -- LAB WHICH IS PERKIN ELMER -- AND THEY WILL START WITH THE CAPACITY OF FORTY THOUSAND TESTS A DAY AND BUILD UP OVER THE NEXT MONTHS UP TO YOU KNOW UPWARDS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND TESTS A DAY OUR EXISTING CAPACITY -- SO THAT WE CAN EXPAND TESTING -- THROUGHOUT THE WINTER MONTHS AND GREG DO YOU DID DO YOUR FACILITIES HAVE ACCESS TO ALL THESE TESTS ARE THEY ARE THEY COMFORTABLE IN TERMS OF EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENING THEY THEY ARE DEFINITELY BETTER OFF THAN THEY WERE AT THE THE PC ARE AT AND YOU KNOW AS YOU AS YOU THINK YOU KNOW MISSED FONG THERE'S THERE'S THE PCR TEST WHICH IS THE GOLD STANDARD WHICH IS WHAT CDPH REALLY WANTS THE THE TURN AROUND TIME ON THOSE CAST IS IMPROVED DRAMATICALLY AND AND THEY ARE ABLE TO GET THOSE IN MUCH BETTER WAY THERE ARE CHALLENGES STILL HERE THOUGH I WOULD SAY FOR EXAMPLE SOME OF THE HELP SOME HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS REQUIRED THE THE STAFF TO GO TO THEIR SITE TO BE TESTED VERSUS HAVING THE FACILITY TAKE DO THE TEST AND HOUSE AND SENDING IT TO THE LAB SO THAT THAT TAKES TIME OFF OF THE STAFF TIME TO GET THEMSELVES TESTED SOME WAYS THE OTHER THING I WOULD JUST MENTION TO YOU IS IN A NUMBER OF STATES THEY ARE ALLOWING THE USE OF THE ANTIGEN TEST AND YOU KNOW THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SENT ANTIGEN TEST MACHINES EVERY FACILITY IN THE COUNTRY AND THOSE ARE TURNAROUND BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THAT THE ACCURACY LEVEL IS NOT IS NOT AS GOOD AS A GOOD TURNAROUND IS LIKE FIFTEEN MINUTES OR LESS ALSO MOST FACILITIES ARE NOT UTILIZING WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS HAS PROVIDED THEM IN THAT AREA ARENA BECAUSE THE YET THE STANDARD CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER I WOULD SAY IT'S ARTICLE IT'S ART I I JUST I THINK THAT THE PCR TEST IS THE GOLD STANDARD AND SO IF SOMEONE TEST UNDER THAT CDPH GUIDANCE IF SOMEONE TESTS NEGATIVE THEY HAVE TO FOLLOW UP WITH PCR TEST ANYWAY SO THEY TEST NEGATIVE WITH THE WITH THE ANTIGEN TEST THEY STILL HAVE TO GO GET A PCR TEST SO -- YEAH THE PCR WOULD BE IS PREFERABLE BUT IT IS MUCH MORE COSTLY AND IT IS IT DOES TAKE MORE TIME AND AND SO I THINK THAT IT IS IMPROVED BUT IT COULD GO IT COULD GET BETTER AND IT'S HEIDI SAID THAT THE PERKIN ELMER LAB WE WOULD WE WERE HOPING THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WILL BE A PRIORITY FOR THE USE OF THIS PERKINELMER LAB THAT THE STATE HAS CONTRACTED WITH IT'S GOING TO TURN AROUND A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND TEST DAY I BELIEVE -- AND SO WE'RE HOPING THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND OTHER CONGREGATE CARE FACILITIES COULD BE PART OF THAT IS THE PREFERENCE -- TWO TESTS AT THE FACILITY I MEAN WHAT A MOBILE UNIT IS THAT THE YOUR IS THAT THE YES FROM ME MEMBERS OKAY YES DEFINITELY BECAUSE IT IS THE I THINK THAT IT THAT IS SIMPLER IN SO MANY WAYS TO BE ABLE TO TEST AT THE FACILITY AB VERSES THAT STAFF HAVING TO LEAVE THE FACILITY OR TO GO TO ENOUGH KAISER FOR EXAMPLE -- TO TAP THEIR TEST -- IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER IF THEY COULD DO THAT IN HOUSE AT SOME FACILITIES CAN DO THAT SOME COULD NOT BUT AS YOU KNOW -- THE STATE IS REQUIRED TO HEALTH PLANS TO PAY FOR THE TESTING FOR THEIR FOR A FOREIGN WORKERS AND AND SOME OF THE HEALTH PLANS JUST REQUIRED FOR THAT STAFF TO REQUIRE THEIR PEOPLE COME TO THE THEIR FACILITY FOR TESTING AND JUST LAST I GUESS THE LAST QUESTION TO THE SENATOR IS IN TERMS OF THIS HEARING THAT IT IS IS IS THE PERKINS ELMER LAB ARE THEY GOING TO PRIORITIZE SCOOTERS IN THE CITY STAFF OR RESIDENTS OR BOTH YES WE'RE GONNA BE PRIORITIZING ALL CONGREGATE SETTINGS OF BOTH ONES UNDER AB DEPARTMENT SOCIAL SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH PERFECT THANK YOU AND MAYBE THIS IS MAYBE FOR CRACK BUT MISSED A MISSED AND -- YOU CAN JUMP INTO AYE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THERE IS LIKE A FIVE STAR QUALITY RATING SYSTEM -- FOR NURSING FACILITIES -- YES IS THERE A WAY -- UPDATED -- OR MODERNIZE IT TO MAKE INFORMATION MORE READILY AVAILABLE CRAIG YOU'D MENTIONED THAT YOU WOULD LIKE KIND OF A ONE PORTAL SYSTEM FOR EVERYONE TO HAVE INFORMATION IS THAT PART OF THAT DISCUSSION OR THAT YOU ARE MAYBE ADDRESS THAT THAT TRANSPARENCY YEAH THE FIVE STAR THE FIVE STAR REALLY LOOKS A QUALITY THAT'S REALLY WHAT IT'S IT'S FOCUSED ON AND ALL THE METRICS RELATED QUALITY I THINK WHAT I WAS REALLY TALKING ABOUT WAS ONE PLACE FOR -- THAT EVERYONE CAN UNDERSTAND ALL THE DIFFERENT GUIDES BECAUSE WE GET WE HAVE SOMETIMES WE HAVE FEDERAL GUIDANCE FOR EXAMPLE IN VISITATION WE HAVE FEDERAL GUIDANCE ON VISITATION STATE GUIDELINE VISITATION STATUS TRIED TO MARRY THAT UP BUT AS YOU HEARD THE COLON'S MOTHER SAY THE COUNTIES THAT WOULD THEN HAVE THEIR OWN SET OF GUIDANCE SO THERE THERE'S NO IT'S THERE'S NOT IT'S NOT THERE'S NO WILL ONE STOP SHOPPING AND THAT'S JUST ONE EXAMPLE OF THEIR OTHER REQUIREMENTS TO WEAR THAT SOME COUNTIES -- WILL PLACE -- AND IT MISSION TO BAN ON FACILITIES AND THEN THE STATE OF THE STATE GUIDES MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ON THAT SO I THINK LIKE I SAID FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO SEE IN ONE PLACE ALL THE DIFFERENT GUIDANCE AND REQUIREMENTS WHETHER THEY'RE FEDERAL STATE OR LOCAL AT THE FIVE STAR IS REALLY MORE OF MORE FOR THE CONSUMER -- TO FIND INFORMATION ABOUT THE ABOUT THE AT THE QUALITY OF THE OF THE FACILITIES MS AKERS AT WILL AS A WAY TO KIND OF BLEND IT ALL WHEN YOU GOT THE ONE CITY GET THE PORTAL RIGHT NOW THE DASHBOARD THAT HAS THAT WOULD IT BE ABLE TO WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO ADD EVERYTHING THAT WAS I MEAN ALL THIS INFORMATION TO ONE OR IS THAT IT IS A BETTER TO KEEP IT SEPARATE I GUESS I'M NO SO WE HAVE -- AS FAR AS ALL OF OUR DATA AND INFORMATION THAT'S ON A ONE STOP PORTAL BUT AND WHAT CRAIG'S ALLUDING TO IS WE HAVE OUR ALL OF OUR STATES GUIDANCE ARE ALL FACILITY LETTERS FROM DPH THOSE ARE ALL ON OUR WEBSITE WE CAN ALSO PUT ALL OF OUR FEDERAL FROM CMS -- ON THERE AS WELL THE TRICK IS ON HAVING EVERY -- COUNTY AND EVERY PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER THEN -- THE LINKS THERE ARE HEALTH ORDERS TO OUR WEBSITE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY EVERY COUNTY CAN HAVE YOU KNOW THEIR OWN HEALTH ORDER -- AROUND COVE IT IN SO IT WOULD BE A MATTER OF TRYING TO -- ASK THAT ALL OF OUR INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES WOULD THEN HAVE TO AGREE TO -- POSTING IT ON A STATE WEBSITE WERE LINKING IT OR WE CAN MAYBE EVEN LINK TO ALL OF THE COUNTIES BUT THAT SOMEONE WOULD STILL HAVE TO GO THROUGH OUR WEBSITE TO THEN LOOK AT ALL THE COUNTIES OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING AND AND IN TERMS OF THAT SCENARIO -- HOW DOES THAT HOW DO YOU TELL A CDPH WORK WITH THE COUNTIES OF THE COUNTIES GO STRICT ARE HAVE A DIFFERENCE I WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT HOW DO THEY IS THERE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THERE ARE ARE HOW DO I KNOW YEAH I KNOW ABSOLUTELY IT'S A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS THERE'S BEEN MULTIPLE TIMES YOU HAVE CALLED A PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS AND SHE WALKS THROUGH YOU KNOW OUR WHAT OUR VISITATION GUIDANCE IS WHAT THEIR VISITATION GUIDES AS WHAT ARE THE CONCERNS YOU KNOW FIND -- SOME MIDDLE GROUND OR ONLINE -- AND I NORMALLY YOU KNOW WORKED AGAIN TRYING TO TAKE IT FROM A SCIENCE APPROACH OF CAKE YOU KNOW IF SOMEONE IS SIX FEET APART AND THAT WEARING A MASK AND THEY'RE IN THIS LARGE VENTILATED SPACE YOU KNOW WHAT IS YOU KNOW WHAT IS THE CONCERN BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THAT THAT IS SAFE AS PRACTICE FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A VISITATION AND SO WE TRY TO WALK THROUGH WHAT THE ISSUES ARE BUT THEY ARE DEFINITELY YOU KNOW MULTI FACTORIAL DEPENDING ON WHAT IS GOING ON IN THAT PARTICULAR COUNTY OKAY CO DISCOURAGE COUNTIES FROM ACTING SEPARATELY OR DID YOU HAVE WELL THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY ULTIMATE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT THAT'S THE WAY THAT OUR OUR LOCAL -- PUBLIC HEALTH AND GOVERNMENT IS SET UP A WE DO HAVE DR ERICA PAN -- WHO IS ARE ACTING STATE HEALTH OFFICER OF COURSE AND THAT IS HER ROLE AS WELL TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES IN IN GIVING ON A WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES AS FAR AS DIRECTION BUT NOW WE WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY AS BEST AS WE CAN TO TO GET AS MUCH ALIGNMENT IS POSSIBLE CAN YOU RECOMMEND THIS ITEM YEAH I THINK IT JUST AND JUST ONE QUICK THING I THINK TO TO SHOW YOU HOW DIFFICULT SOME OF THIS CAN BE WHAT IT COUNTY DOES ON FOR EXAMPLE I'M AWARE ONE COUNTY IN THE BAY AREA THIS THAT PARTICULAR ONE PARTICULAR STANDARD FOR EMISSIONS FROM HOSPITALS THAT HAS AN EFFECT OBVIOUSLY AND SNIFFS IN THAT COUNTY BUT IT HAS AN EFFECT ON ALL THE SURROUNDING COUNTIES GIVEN THAT THE BAY AREA FOR EXAMPLE IS A DYNAMIC REGION WHERE PEOPLE MOVED COUNTY THE COUNTY PRETTY PRETTY -- PRETTY OFTEN SO THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK IT'S IT'S A CHALLENGE JUST FOR FACILITIES TO OPERATE IN THAT KIND OF ENVIRONMENT -- WHERE WHERE AND WE UNDERSTAND CLEARLY A LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH DIRECTORS HAVE THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY HERE BUT JUST JUST GETTING A HANDLE ON THE WIDE VARIETY HAS BEEN A CHALLENGE FOR OXFORD FOR FACILITIES TO OPERATE SO IT'S GREAT RECOMMENDED THE PUBLIC OTHER OFFICERS PARKOUR NAY WITH WITH THAT EVERYBODY I GUESS AND IN SOME WAYS IT MAY AND THAT MAY BE PART OF THIS WEEKLY A BEST PRACTICE OF HAVING A WEEKLY KIND OF COORDINATING KIND OF SHARE INFORMATION I GUESS THAT'S THE BEST PRACTICE THAT'S COME OUT OF IT -- -- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MY LAST -- NICOLE I WAS JUST GONNA SAY I KNOW DR WASSERMAN WANTED TO JUMP IN AND IF YOU ARE INTERESTED I'M SORRY I I I IF ANYONE JUMP WANT TO JUMP AND I APOLOGIZE I JUST I'M JUST GONNA MAKE SURE IT'S OKAY WITH YOU THAT'S ABSOLUTELY DR THANK YOU SO MUCH IT IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF A CHALLENGE FROM THE BEING VIRTUAL SO NOT I WONDER I WONDER I ACTUALLY HAD A FEW THINGS I COULD COMMENT ON -- BUT I WANTED TO PREFACE IT WITH A WORD I'VE COME TO UNDERSTAND OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS WHICH IS THE WORD STAKEHOLDER AND I I WANT TO COMMEND CDPH FOR ENGAGING THE GERIATRICS COUNCIL AND CAL TCM WE ARE NOT STAKEHOLDERS WE ARE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND I REALLY CONTINUE TO BE CHALLENGED BY A DISPUTE BYE BYE HOW THE PROCESS WORKS WHERE STAKEHOLDERS DO YOU HAVE THEIR INPUT AND THE SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN DISCUSSIONS THAT DRIVE POLICY THAT MAKE DECISIONS AND I'LL GIVE YOU A FEW EXAMPLES WE DIDN'T HAVE GERIATRICIANS ARE EXPERTS IN LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE ON THE TESTING TASK FORCE AND THAT LED TO SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN KNOWLEDGE REGARDING RESPONSE TO TESTING I'M ALSO I DO WANT TO COMMENT ON THE OVERALL MORTALITY AND I DO AGREE THAT THE STATE HAS DONE AN INCREDIBLE JOB OF PUTTING INTO ACTION A NUMBER OF MECHANISMS AND MITIGATION EFFORTS THAT HAVE REDUCED MORTALITY BUT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU A COUPLE CABBIE ODDS ALMOST MANY OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WERE MADE BY THE EXPERTS IN MARCH AND TOOK TILL JUNE JULY AUGUST SEPTEMBER OCTOBER BEFORE THEY WERE IMPLEMENTED LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED AND -- I I AND THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS DON'T REALIZE AS A GERIATRICIAN LOOKING AT THE NUMBERS FOR EIGHT MONTHS IN THE DATA ONE OF THE REASONS OVERALL MORTALITY HAS GONE DOWN IS IS BECAUSE WE'RE IMPROVING IN OUR EFFORTS BUT IT'S ALSO BECAUSE THE MOST FRAIL MEMBERS OF OUR NURSING HOMES HAVE ALREADY DIED SO AND THEY'RE NOT BEING REPLACED AND SO THE THE DATA I'M NOT SURPRISED THAT MORTALITY RATES ARE LOWER NOW IN THE THE THING THAT CONCERNS ME AS WELL WE'VE MADE IMPROVEMENTS VULNERABLE OLDER ADULTS CONTINUE TO DIE EVERY WEEK AND AND AND AND I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T LOOK AT THEIR SAYS HEY WE'RE DOING GREAT WE ARE STILL LOSING VULNERABLE RESIDENTS WE ARE STILL LOSING FRONTLINE STAFF I I ALSO WANTED TO COMMENT ON THE VA -- I I'VE BEEN IN TOUCH WITH MY VA COLLEAGUES FROM THE BEGINNING AND THE VA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF HAVING GERIATRICIANS INVOLVED HAVING ENGAGE MEDICAL DIRECTORS INVOLVED HAVING ENOUGH STAFFING INVOLVED I DOCTOR TOM YOSHIKAWA I WAS ACTUALLY ON ONE OF OUR EXPERT GROUPS HE'S AT THE VA IN WEST LOS ANGELES -- THAT MADE RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND TESTING THAT WE PUBLISHED AT THE END OF MAY SO I THINK THE VA IS A GREAT EXAMPLE OF WHAT WORKS AND I STRONGLY RECOMMEND WE LOOK AT THAT AS AS AS A POSITIVE THE QUESTION WAS ASKED ABOUT THE VACCINE PRIORITIZATION I ACTUALLY HAD THE HONOR OF SERVING ON THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCE A COMMITTEE THAT MADE RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE ALLOCATION OF VACCINE AND THERE IS NO QUESTION THAT FRONTLINE NURSING HOME STAFF ARE THIS ARE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT GROUPS TO GET VACCINATED BUT WHAT WE'VE ACTUALLY CONVENE ANOTHER GROUP OF EXPERTS TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS AND GIVE GUIDANCE AT THE STATE AND FEDERAL LEVEL BECAUSE WHAT YOU'VE HEARD TODAY IS THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE GOING TO OCCUR WHEN WE START TRYING TO IMPLEMENT THE VACCINE WITH THE FRONTLINE STAFF AND AGAIN THIS IS I KNOW THIS IS NOT NECESSARILY A FORM FOR HEARING ALL THOSE DETAILS I AM HAPPY TO SHARE THAT WITH YOUR STAFF BE EASY IN FACT THE WAY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS SET UP THE PROCESS THEY HAVE BASICALLY GIVEN RESPONSIBILITY TO CVS AND WALGREENS TO VACCINATE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS THEY'VE GIVEN EACH STATE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DECIDE HOW THE NURSING HOME STAFFER VACCINATED AND THAT CREATES AND I'VE ACTUALLY BEEN IN TOUCH WITH SOME OF THE MAJOR VACCINE MANUFACTURERS THEY HAVE BEEN GIVEN A LOT OF GREAT DIRECTION BY THE FEDS SO THERE'S A LOT MORE CONFUSION AROUND THIS THING ANYONE IS TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW AND I AND I THINK THAT'S THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT -- SO THOSE ARE THE THINGS UP TO THIS POINT THAT I I REALLY JUST WANTED TO MAKE SURE I I I I MADE SOME COMMENTS ON AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE THEM I KNOW IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT IN THIS SORT OF SETTING HERE THANK YOU THANK YOU DOCTOR BACK TO MR FONG I THINK I THINK YOU'RE NOT A QUESTION THANK YOU YES I I I DO DIS SHARED HIS ADDUCTOR WATCHMAN'S CONCERNED ABOUT A SENSE OF URGENCY AND TRYING TO MOVE AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE AND AND LEARNING A LOT IS THAT SINCE MY LAST TWO QUESTIONS THAT TO THE HAVE WE QUANTIFIED IT -- WHAT THE SHORTAGE IS -- OF OF LABOR STAFF -- C. N. A.'S -- INTO AT THE STATE I LIVE BEING FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN A RURAL AREA -- YOU KNOW WE CERTAINLY HAVE EVEN MORE -- CHALLENGES WHEN IT COMES TO SHORTAGES OF NURSES SO I I'M -- IS THERE IS THAT WE QUANTIFY THAT IN AND I THINK YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR TESTIMONY BACKLOG OR SOMETHING ISSUE IT TESTING -- -- ARE ARE GETTING CERTIFIED THE CERTIFIED TESTING OUT THAT NOT THE TESTING KOBE BUT THAT THE TESTING OF ACTUALLY GETTING THESE -- CNA'S IN SAID THAT ANSIBLE WORKFORCE CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT AND WITH THAT I I APPRECIATE THE CHAIRMAN'S INDULGENCE IN PATIENTS SO I'M GONNA START WITH YOUR SECOND QUESTION FOR THE FIRST TIME ACTUALLY DEFERRED A CRAG AND HEIDI AT THE SHORT ANSWER IS THAT YES THEY HAVE BUT I THINK THE REAL ANSWER IS MUCH MORE NUANCED SO IN TERMS OF BACKLOG TESTING AT THE HEALTHCARE GROUP PATHWAY WE HAD STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED IN MAY TESTING CENTERS WERE CLOSED WHEN THEY RE OPEN TESTING CENTERS WHICH ARE NOT SUPER PLENTIFUL IN GENERAL THEY WENT BACK TO THE EARLIER APPOINTMENT SO IF YOU GRADUATE IN MAY THE STUDENTS THAT WE WORK WITH JUST BEGAN TESTING LAST WEEK AND THE REMAINDER WILL TAKE THEIR TEST NEXT WEEK NOW WHY THAT'S PROBLEMATIC AND WE WERE ALL LEARNING A NEW NORMAL BUT IT'S PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE AT THE SAME TIME WE WERE ISSUING STOPPING WAIVERS TO FACILITIES AND WE WERE SAYING YOU COULD HAVE A A NURSING ASSISTANT WHICH ESSENTIALLY IS THAT AS YOU NAMES HALFWAY THROUGH TRAINING COME WORK WITH YOU THEY GET PAID LESS THEY CAN'T DO THE FULL SCOPE OF WORKERS THAT WERE ISSUED WAIVERS FOR THAT BUT WE DIDN'T PRIORITIZE HOW WE FIND OUR WAY THROUGH THIS AND I THINK THAT SOMETIMES IT'S A WAY OF THINKING IT'S A WAY OF PROCESSING IT THAT I THINK THAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT THE WHOLE SYSTEM WE WE RELAX REGULATIONS REALLY ARE AT A RAPID CLIP BUT I THINK WE DIDN'T ALWAYS LOOK WHAT'S THE FULL AFFECTED HOW THAT PLAYS OUT I ALSO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE STATE AS AS HARDY SAID THAT THERE ARE -- YOU KNOW THEY'VE IDENTIFIED FORMER C. N. AC WERE CERTIFIED WHO AREN'T WORKING NOW THE REASON THAT WORKING AS A LOT IT WAS ONE OF VERY CHALLENGING WORK IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BUT I WOULD ALSO SAY SOMETIMES THE CULTURE AND VALUE FOR THOSE FOLKS RUN THE FRONT LINE IS NOT ALWAYS WHAT IT SHOULD SO WHEN I HEAR FROM C. N. A.'S WHO WENT INTO THE FIELD AND LEFT PARTLY IT'S THAT THEY WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL IN CHANGING THE CULTURE THEY WOMEN DESIRING TO BE CARE GIVERS BUT THE SYSTEM WAS SET UP WHERE THEY HAD TEN ELEVEN TWELVE WE'LL TO CARE FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD OF TIME AND THEY WERE ABLE TO DO FOR AS EFFECTIVELY AS THEY WOULD WANT PART OF WHAT OUR STUDENTS LEARN HOW TO MANAGE UP WHICH I THINK IS SOMETHING WE ALL LEARN WHICH IS IT WHEN THEY'RE IN A COMFORTABLE SITUATION THE SUPERVISOR WHEN THEY THINK THERE'S A BETTER WAY TO CARE FOR RESIDENT HOW THEY HAVE THAT CONVERSATION RESPECTFULLY HOW THEY RETAIN THAT AUTHORITY AND ENGAGE IN THAT RELATIONSHIP IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE AND THIS IS WHAT I THINK THAT YOU SHOULD REALLY BE AWARE OF IS -- AND I SAY THIS A LOT YOU KNOW MY GRAMMAR WITH GRAMMARLY TO HOTEL MADE SHE DIDN'T FINISH ELEMENTARY SCHOOL YOU KNOW THAT THE MAIDS OF YESTER YEAR OFTEN THE CARE GIVERS UP TODAY AND WE ARE SO LUCKY TO HAVE THEM MANY OF THEM ARE AT THE FIRST IN THEIR FAMILY TO TO BE IN THIS COUNTRY TO BE ENGAGING IN THIS KIND OF WORK AND THEY MAY NOT ALWAYS FEEL CARE COMFORTABLE CHALLENGING AN ASSUMPTION RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S A POWER DIFFERENCE THERE WE NEED TO BE MINDFUL THAT THE REASON PEOPLE ARE NOT WORKING AS CNA'S ISN'T ONLY ABOUT THE CONVERSATION BUT IT IS ABOUT THE COMPENSATION IT'S ALSO ABOUT THE CULTURE THAT WE VALUE FOR CARE GIVERS AND YOUR FIRST QUESTION I'M GONNA SLIDE AWAY AND LET CREGGAN HIGHER HEIDI ANSWER THAT HAS THE TESTING BEFORE THIS THE TESTING NOT BEEN ADDRESSED OR AS AS ARE THEY ROOF THAT THEY STARTED AGAIN OR NO TESTING HAS RESTARTED YES THANK YOU VERY VERY QUICKLY MR FOR THIS FUNKY YOUR QUESTION ABOUT C. N. A.'S -- THE LATEST DATA FROM HOTSPOT I BELIEVE THAT OVER OVER THE NEXT DECADE STATE WILL NEED AT LEAST THIRTY THOUSAND MORE C. N. A.'S ALONG IN THE NEXT DECADE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU I THANK YOU CHAIRMAN THINK THANK YOU MR FONG WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER COOPER NEXT THE DOCTOR WHAT IT IS FULL OF MICHAEL IS CONCERNED ABOUT THE DESTINATIONS OF TWENTY SEVEN PERCENT OF THE DEATHS OCCURRING SNFS OBVIOUSLY THAT SEEMS IMPORTANT AND I HOPE THE -- SINISA BE PRIORITIZED SNIFF RIGHT NOW THAT IT WAS A SHOCK TO CDPH -- THEY HAVE A WEBSITE CHALFONT ST YOU CAN GO LOOK AT ALL THE DIFFERENT COMPLAINTS AGAINST THEM REALLY GET A GOOD IDEA ONE OF THEM WITH A BETTER SNIFFS AROUND SO WE ACTUALLY GOT A REALLY GOOD MORNING IN SEPTEMBER THAT WERE VERY HAPPY WITH SO THANK YOU THE CTF I'M SORRY C. PH FOR THAT -- YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT YOU'LL SEE AMAZING GETTING ON THIS BIG ISSUE THE FUNDING IS NOT THERE WASN'T A FOR DINNER CAL THAT'S ALWAYS BEEN A BIG ISSUE WITH IT BEING CUT IN ANYWHERE I MEAN IT IF YOU PAY PAYS DECENT PEOPLE COME AND THE PROBLEM WITH THE RECRUITING RETENTION IS THE PAY AND IT'S IT'S JUST THERE AND YOU KNOW I GUESS MY QUESTION TO DH CS IS -- WITH LABOR COST BEING CAPPED -- WHY DON'T WE FULLY FUND THE COST OF LABOR FOR SKILLED FOR SNIFFS BANGKOK CAPS ARE INCLUDED IT YOU FIND I'VE TO THAT NINETY THREE PERCENT UP WE NEED A CHANGE IN THE MOST RECENT TO BRING ABOUT COST CAP -- -- AND THEN ADDITIONALLY WE ARE THREE THAT THROUGH THE STATUTE WE ARE LIMITED TO A PERCENTAGE OKAY BUT IT WAS IT WAS STILL ISSUE THAT THAT JUST HAPPENED RECENTLY CORRECT RECTO THAT WOULD THAT BACK BUT MY TAX MONEY THAT WAS PART OF THE CHANGES THAT THAT HAPPENED DURING THAT THE LACK BUDGET CYCLE TO CHANGE HOW WE CALCULATE THOSE -- THAT METHODOLOGY TO INCREASE THAT TO NINETY FIVE THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER HE GAVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO ASK QUESTIONS AND SINCE I WAS NEXT SO I'M GONNA GO AHEAD AND DO THAT -- FIRST WELL THESE ARE THE FIRST COUPLE QUESTIONS ARE GOING TO BE FOR MISDIAGNOSIS BACK ON HERE I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION IS YOU KNOW WE HAVE THE OFFICE OF THESE LETTERS REQUIRING THAT DEEP FULL TIME INFECTION PREVENTION IS -- IS THAT HAPPENING IN EVERY -- SKILLED NURSING FACILITY NOW SINCE ANYBODY OUT THERE I CAN'T SIX SORRY I MUST'VE BEEN ON MUTE OKAY OH SORRY ALSO SORT OF -- QUESTION MARK WHAT -- SO YES WE DID RECEIVE IN JUNE ALL TWELVE HUNDRED FACILITIES TURNED IT THEIR COVERT MITIGATION PLAN -- AND EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE A FEW THAT NEEDED SOME REITERATIONS OFFICIALLY APPROVED ARE THEY ALL WERE EVENTUALLY APPROVED AND THEN WE GO OUT EVERY FOUR TO SIX WEEKS TO THE END VERIFY THAT THEY ARE IN FACT TO DOING -- SO AND ONE OF THOSE PIECES OF THAT MEDICATION PLAN IS THAT FULL TIME INFECTION PREVENTION ROLE -- WE HAVE -- FOUND INSTANCES AND -- ENFORCED WHERE WE DID NOT FIND -- A FULL TIME INFECTION ROLE AFFECTION PREVENTION IS ROLL ON THE EONS BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT THAT IS A KEY KEY FACTOR HERE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF DEDICATED ROLE NOT SOMEONE WHO IS -- I'M GOING TO BE THE DIRECTOR OF NURSING AND TO THE I.

ON THE SIDE -- OR I'M GONNA BE A FRONTLINE YOU'RE A NURSE AND THE AND I KEY ON THE SIDE BUT SOMEONE WHO IS THAT DEDICATED ROLE OKAY THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M THE NEW SURVEY MODEL WITH RESPECT TO THE STATEMENT OF DEFICIENCIES CAN YOU TELL ME WHAT THAT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE AND WILL THE SURVEYORS BE ISSUING CITATIONS AND FINES AS WELL SO I'M ASSUMING YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT THE QUALITY AND SAFETY SURVEY MODEL THAT WILL BE IMPLEMENTING A POST PANDEMIC SO CURRENTLY WE HAVE OUR COBIT MITIGATION PLANS ON THAT WE ARE GOING AND LIKE I SAID EVERY FOUR TO SIX WEEKS AND WHAT WE STARTED TO THINK UP WELL HOW COULD WE PREVENT THIS FROM HAPPENING YOU KNOW AGAIN EVEN IN A POST PANDEMIC WORLD BECAUSE PRE PANDEMIC WE ONLY ENTERED FACILITIES SO WE KNOW THAT ANNUAL IS NOT ENOUGH IF WE LEARNED ANYTHING ITS FREQUENCY IN THE POWER OF PRESENCE AND BEING PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN THESE FACILITIES MORE OFTEN WHICH GARNERS BETTER -- COMPLIANCE IN SO -- THE QUALITY AND SAFETY MODEL YES THEY WOULD BE ISSUING -- ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ON PENALTY CITATIONS ALL -- SERVING THE SAME REGULATOR -- MODEL THAT THEY -- CURRENTLY PLAY THE DIFFERENCE IS THE FREQUENCY AND KEEPING THIS LEVEL OF POST PANDEMIC SO AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEW MODELS HERE THE THE FAMILY THE RESIDENT COMPLAINTS -- ARE THEY GOING TO BE INVESTIGATED THROUGH US A NEW PROCESS AND AND WHAT'S THE CURRENT BACKLOG OF CREE COVE IT INVESTIGATIONS HOW MANY HOW AND HOW LONG IS IT TAKING TO OCCUR GREAT QUESTION SO WHEN I WAS APPOINTED IN DECEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN -- WE IN HYATT HERITAGE EIGHTY I THINK IT WAS AROUND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND BACKLOG OF ALL NON LONG TERM CARE AND LONG TERM CARE COMBINED TO COMPLAINTS AND FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS MOST OF THOSE OF WHICH WERE FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENTS I'M NOT COMPLAINTS AND I WOULD SAY IT WAS ABOUT SPLIT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN NON LONG TERM CARE AND LONG TERM CARE SETTINGS WE PUT TOGETHER A ROOT CAUSE ANALYSIS OF HOW THIS BACKLOG EVEN HAPPENED IN CALIFORNIA -- AND WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SEVERAL ROOT CAUSES THAT WERE THE MAIN IMPETUS FOR THIS AND THEN PUT TOGETHER A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO REDUCE THAT -- EONS WHEN WE WE INITIATED THAT AND THAT WHAT WE CALL THE DEBT FREE TWENTY TWENTY ONE PLAN IN OCTOBER OF TWENTY NINETEEN AND IN JUST A FEW SHORT MONTHS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC KIDDING -- WE WERE UP TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OVERALL TOTAL REDUCTION AND THAT'S NOT JUST OF -- ALL THE BACK LOT COMPLAINTS BUT THAT WAS ALSO INCLUDING THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE MEANING EVERYTHING COMING IN AND EVERYTHING THAT WAS BACK LOCKED BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD TO JUST WORK OFF THE BACKLOG AND THEN CONTINUE TO ACCRUE WHATEVER IS COMING IN SO THAT WAS THE WHOLE UNIVERSE LOOK AT JUST THE BACKLOG THAT WAS IT YOU KNOW MAYBE FIFTY PERCENT ALREADY TAKING CARE OF -- BUT WHAT MATTERS TO ME IS THAT THEN WHEN WE HIT THE PANDEMIC IN MARCH AND APRIL WELL WE WERE TRYING TO GARNER ENOUGH PP FOR STAFF WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO COME UP WITH NEW INFECTION CONTROL PROCESSES AS WELL AS DOING INFECTION CONTROL FEDERAL SURVEYS -- THEN THERE WAS A FEW WEEKS AFTER WE STOPPED AND THEN WE FOCUSED OTHER ACTIVITIES SO UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF OUR BACKLOG WORK -- HAD TO TAKE AND DEDICATED DURING THE FIRST OF THOSE INITIAL MONTHS I'M AND THEN WE WERE ABLE TO -- WE BEGAN THOSE COMPLAIN AFTER RIGHT -- -- -- INVESTIGATIONS WE DO THOSE INVESTIGATIONS IN TANDEM WITH OR IN PARALLEL WITH OUR -- WITH MEDICATIONS OR WE GO OUT ONTO A COVERT MITIGATION SURVEY WE ALSO TAKE ANY COMPLAINTS OR F. RIGHTS THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT FACILITY -- AND THEN THE PLAN IS ALSO POST PANDEMIC AS WE ARE CONTINUING THIS LEVEL OF FREQUENCY TO WORK OFF THE BACKLOG EVEN MORE QUICKLY BY BRINGING THESE COMPLAINTS EVER ARISE WITH US TO THOSE FACILITIES BECAUSE IN ORDER TO DO A FEDERAL INVESTIGATION IT IS REQUIRED THAT YOU GO ON SITE AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO REDUCE TRAVEL TIME WHICH WAS A BIG FACTOR IN OUR GREAT STATE THAT HAS A LOT OF GEOGRAPHICAL AND CHALLENGES WITH YOU KNOW SOME MOUNTAINS THAT WE CAN'T PASS THROUGH THE WINTERTIME EXPECTORANT AND -- A LOT OF RURAL AREAS THAT ARE HARDER TO GET TO THE OTHER PIECE WITH THIS IS THAT WE ARE LOOKING TO RECRUIT NOW THAT WE HAVE SYSTEMS IN PLACE TO DO OUR WORK -- AND AT THAT TELEWORKING WORLD IN MOVING THINGS FROM PAPER TO ELECTRONIC WERE ABLE TO ALSO THEN HAS A FASTER TIME TO TASK AS FAR AS GETTING INFORMATION BACK TO THE FACILITY HAVING A FACILITY ENTER INTO A PORTAL SYSTEM WHERE THEY CAN ACCESS THEIR FINDINGS AND BE ABLE TO ISSUE THEIR PLANS OF CORRECTION ELECTRONICALLY PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC ALL OF THIS WAS DONE BY SNAIL MAIL AND FAX EVEN IN TWENTY TWENTY AND SO THIS IS A BIG HUGE SHIFT AND LEFT THAT WE ARE MAKING A MOVIE IN OUR SURVEY PROCESSES ONE SURVEY IT ONE TYPE OF SURVEY IT AT A TIME -- ONTO AN ELECTRONIC PROCESS SO THAT IS THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS IS THAT THIS FALL WE ARE NOW WORKING TO MOVE OUR COMPLAINT AND AFTER I INVESTIGATION PROCESS INTO AN ELECTRONIC FORMAT SO THAT WE CAN BOTH WORK OFF THE BACKLOG BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY EFFICIENTLY AND BE ABLE TO A MORE TIMELY MANNER TO THE FACILITIES THANK YOU -- NEXT I'VE GOT A COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR MISTER CORNET FEASA PUT AROUND IN THERE THANK YOU YES SIR YEAH -- COUPLE COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU SO WE TALKED ABOUT -- THE NEED FOR MORE MONEY FOR WORK FORCE OBVIOUSLY CHALLENGES WITH OUR MEDICARE RATES AND AND AND SO ON SO -- NOTE NONPROFIT RUN FACILITIES VERSUS FOR PROFIT RUN FACILITIES THEY'RE ALL IN REIMBURSE THE SAME RATES OR ARE THEY NOT OR ARE THEY NOT THEY THERE NOPE NO ONE'S THE INVERSE THE SAME RATES EVER GET TO FILL FACILITY SPECIFIC RATE BUT IS ALSO CONSTRAINED I WOULD ALSO SAY TO THEY ARE VERY DIFFERENT PATIENT MIXES IN IN -- FOR EXAMPLE -- NONPROFIT FACILITIES OVERALL I HAVE ABOUT HALF THE LEVEL OF OF OF MEDICARE PATIENTS THAT FOR PROFIT FACILITIES DO SO MEDICARE OFFICER -- FOR PROFITS AT LEAST TEN DEAD HAVE MUCH MUCH HIGHER MEDICARE HELP A PATIENT -- -- POPULATIONS OKAY -- IS THAT PART OF IT IT'S HARD TO IT'S A LITTLE HARD TO TO DO A DIRECT COMPARISON THAT BUT EACH WEEK WE HAVE FACILITY SPECIFIC RATES BUT I WOULD SAY TO YOU THOUGH IS IS AND YOU HEARD LINDY'S -- MENTIONED THIS EARLIER THE WAY THE REIMBURSEMENT STRUCTURE WORKS IS DE KOSTER CONSTRAINED SO EVEN THOUGH -- THOUGH THAT THERE WAS AN INCREASE IN IN THE YOU LOOK AT WHAT THE INCREASE WAS IT IS STILL FACILITIES ACROSS THE BOARD ARE STILL PAID SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN WHAT THE FULL COST ARE THAT THEY REPORT -- BY BEING ABLE TO DO A DIRECT PASSED THROUGH FOR LABOR COST FOR EXAMPLE IF THE STATE COULD COMPENSATE FOR THE FULL FULL COST OF LABOR THAT WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN ANY KIND OF FACILITY SO THE TEN PERCENT BUMP DIDN'T GO TO LABOR THAN TWO THOUSAND TEN PERCENT TO TEN PERCENT KOBE BOB IT WENT TO IT IT HAS TO BE USED FOR ANYTHING RELATED TO CO THAT IT IS GOING FOR STAFF BONUSES AND STAFF -- STAFF INCENTIVE PAY IS BEING USED FOR OVERTIME IT'S BEING USED FOR THE ADDITIONAL COST OF PP FOR TECHNOLOGY ALL THE THE THE STATUTE REQUIRES -- EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE REQUIRES THAT THAT TEN PERCENT BUT HAS TO BE USED FOR COPD RELATED EXPENSES MANY AND MOST OF THOSE EXPENSES I SUSPECT ARE ALL GOING TO MOSTLY BE IN THAT IN THE AREA OF STAFFING BECAUSE THE STAFF ACOSTA BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY MORE SICK LEAVE FOR EXAMPLE ARE QUARANTINING -- -- FACILITIES ARE MAKING USE OF THE NURSE REGISTRIES THOSE RATES ARE ABOUT TWICE -- ARE SOMETIMES THREE TIMES MORE THEY'RE HAVING TO PAY A LOT MORE OVER TIME AND THEY'RE PAYING BONUSES AT -- STAFF INCENTIVE -- -- PAY TO BUT HE WITHOUT THEIR THEIR LOW WAGES SO I MEAN COMPARED TO THE WORK YOU KNOW THE IT'S I THINK CERTAINLY PEOPLE ON THIS PANEL BELIEVE THAT YOU KNOW THEY SHOULD BE HARPER THERE SHOULD BE HIGHER COMPENSATION SO YOU'RE PROBABLY BE A FOR PROFIT ENTITIES ARE STILL MAKING A PROFIT WELL THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA THOUGH -- MISTER WOULD WE CAN PROVIDE SOME OF THE STATE THE PRODUCT THE PROFIT MARGINS ARE EXTREMELY LOW IN THE ROUND THE ONE THAT NOT EVEN THE I WOULDN'T CALL THE PROFIT MARGINS BUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE US BY DATA ON THIS THERE IN SOMEWHERE AROUND THE ONE PERCENT RANGE AND I WOULD TELL YOU THE BEST INDICATOR OF THIS IS HOW FEW NEW ENTRIES THERE ARE TO THE MARKET I MEAN THERE ARE ALMOST NO NEW SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA EACH YOU CAN COUNT THEM ON ONE HAND -- AND I THINK THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD INDICATOR THAT THAT YOU KNOW IF THIS WAS THAT A BUSINESS WHERE THERE WAS A LOT OF -- A MONEY TO BE MADE YOU SEE A LOT MORE PEOPLE TO MANAGE TO GET INTO THE BUSINESSES AND THAT'S JUST NOT THE CASE WELL BUT WE ALSO KNOW THERE RELATED PARTIES INVOLVED THAT THAT ARE PART OF THE TANGLED WEB OF THE WAY NURSING HOME OPERATORS OPERATE SO IT'S NOT UNUSUAL FOR MY RECOLLECTION THAT THAT AN OPERATOR MIGHT HAVE ITS OWN LAUNDRY SERVICE AT THE CONTRACT THEY MIGHT HAVE ANOTHER CORRECTLY THAT THE BRAND FROM THE SO THERE'S SO THAT ONE PERCENT DOES IT REFLECT THE PROFIT OF THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY BUT THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF OF THE RELATED PARTIES THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S NOT THERE THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO THAT AND IF YOU RECALL THE AUDIT THAT THE STATE AUDITOR DID LOOK AT THAT ISSUE TOO AND FOUND NO ISSUES RELATED TO TO RELATED PARTIES I TWO YEARS AGO SO OKAY YOU'RE CORRECT THAT THERE ARE RELATED PARTIES BUT AGAIN I JUST TO SAY THAT THEIR DAY THEY'RE NOT ALLOWED TO MAKE A PROFIT OFF THAT AND WE WE'RE NOT AWARE OF ANY AGAIN WITH GIVEN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT WHEN I WEAR THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE SO -- JUST AND THIS WOULD BE A RADICAL QUESTIONS YOU PROBABLY CAN'T ANSWER BUT -- I'M GONNA PUT IT OUT THERE ANYWAY -- IF THERE WERE INCREASED AN INCREASE IN THE MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENT RATE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE INCREASE TO GUARANTEE THAT THAT THAT GO TO INCREASE WAGES FOR WORKERS I THINK THAT THE INDUSTRY WITH VERY LAST PROFESSION WOULD VERY MUCH LIKE TO PAY WORKERS MORE I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY QUESTION ABOUT THAT WHAT I SUGGESTED TO YOU IS A DIRECT PASS THROUGH SO IF THE THAT THE STATE WOULD FULLY COMPENSATE WHATEVER THE THE COST ARE OF OF OF STAFF RIGHT NOW THE FACILITIES ARE INCENTIVIZED TO PUT MONEY INTO STAFF THAT THAT THAT THAT'S THEIR INCENTIVE NOW BECAUSE THEY THE THE IF IT THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THEY'RE ONLY REIMBURSED -- AT THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE FOR THE LABOR COSTS REIMBURSED AT THE NINETY FIFTH PERCENTILE BUT JUST BECAUSE THEY EVEN IF YOU GET TO THE HUNDRED A HUNDRED PERCENT HUNDRED PERCENT I DIDN'T GET TO A HUNDRED PERCENT WITHOUT A HIGHER OVERALL RATE THAT DOESN'T GIVE THEM ANY MORE MONEY -- SO BECAUSE THE RATES RIGHT NOW ARE STILL VERY VERY LOW THEY CAN THEY CAN USE MORE OF THE RATE INCREASE THEY HAVE FOR STAFFING THEY COULD DO THAT HAVE ENOUGH MONEY OVERALL IF THE STATE SIMPLY COMPENSATED WITH A DIRECT PASSED THROUGH FOR LABOR THAT WOULD MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WORLD THANK YOU BRIGITTE -- DR WASSERMAN AND THERE'S WITH MY LAST SERIES OF QUESTIONS SO ARE COUPLE QUESTIONS FOR YOU FIRST OF ALL -- CAN YOU TALK ABOUT SNIFFS AND AND THIRD THE THIRD IN OF THE THIRD PARTY ISSUE -- KIND OF THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY I KNOW ABOUT THE AUDIT I'M THE ONE WHO INITIATED THE AUDIT SO -- BUT BUT I'M CURIOUS AS HOW THIS RELATES TO THE CARES ACT AND HOW THE MONEY FROM CARE SECTOR'S BEEN DISTANT DISSEMINATED IN UTILIZED BY SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES YEAH THANK YOU -- CINNAMON -- PRESHEAF THE QUESTION I'M SO I THINK THE CONCERN THAT SOME OF US HAVE HAD IS HOW THE MONEY FROM THE CARES ACT IS ACTUALLY FOR -- FLOWED TO FACILITIES AND WHETHER THAT MONEY IS BEING SPENT A HUNDRED PERCENT TOWARDS DIRECT PATIENT CARE WITH WHETHER IT BE HAZARD PAY WHETHER IT BE PP WHETHER IT BE TESTING AND I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS THERE'S MULTIPLE WAYS THAT MONEY CAN FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD BE SIPHONED AWAY -- FOR INSTANCE -- YOU MENTION RELATED PARTIES -- THE THE COST REPORT DOESN'T CAPTURE ALL RELATED PARTIES NUMBER ONE SO IN ORDER TO REALLY KNOW SOME OF THESE ANSWERS WE NEED FULL TRANSPARENCY ON ALL OF THE RELATED PARTIES SIMILARLY WE NEED TO GET INTO A LEVEL OF DETAIL FOR EXAMPLE WATER FACILITIES PAYING SAY TO A RELATED PARTY SUPPLIER FOR THEIR P. P. ARE THEY PAYING MARKET RATES ARE THEY PAYING OVER MARKET RATES THERE'S A LOT OF WAYS THAT THE THE THE THE SYSTEM THE MONEY CAN BE MANIPULATED AND ALL THE SAME TIME IF IF SOME OF THAT MONEY IS GOING AWAY FROM THE FACILITY IT'S NOT BEING USED TO PAY OUR FRONTLINE STAFF FOR PUTTING THEIR LIVES AT RISK AND AND I THINK THAT'S OF GREAT CONCERN I THINK THERE THE REAL QUESTION HERE IS WE NEED A FULL FULL AMOUNT OF TRANSPARENCY OF ALL THESE ISSUES THANK YOU -- COUPLE THINGS THAT YOU OTHER THINGS YOU MENTIONED IN YOUR COMMENTS -- AND RECOMMENDATION PARTICULAR ONE WAS TWENTY TO TWENTY TWENTY FOUR HOUR ARE IN ON DUTY -- I WAS KIND OF APPALLED TO REALISE AND KNOW AND UNDERSTAND THAT THE FACILITY DOES NOT REQUIRE A TWENTY FOUR HOUR NURSE AND ARE IN A STE AND OUR AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MEDICAL DOCTOR WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT NURSE PRACTITIONERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND ARE IN SO I'M GOING TO GUESS THAT SOME POINT AS THINGS WIND DOWN IN THE EVENING IT'S IT'S L. B. N. C. N. A.'S AND AND YOU KNOW I'M I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT AND I I I I I WOULD IMAGINE THAT MOST CONSUMERS ARE AWARE OF IT WE CERTAINLY WEREN'T AWARE OF IT AND YOU KNOW I I JUST CAN'T HELP BUT THINK THAT A CHANGE IN THAT DIRECTION WOULD BE A DRAMATIC POTENTIAL IMPROVEMENT IN THE QUALITY OF CARE AND THE QUALITY OF THE HEALTH OF THE RESIDENTS SO THAT SOMETHING EARLY CAN BE CAUGHT -- AND AND YOU KNOW THINGS HAPPEN IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT YOU KNOW I MEAN THAT THAT THEY THEY CLEARLY DO AND AND HOSPITALS AND WHEREVER I'M JUST SHOCKED QUITE FRANKLY THAT THERE ISN'T A REQUIREMENT TO HAVE A NURSE AT OUR END IN THE BUILDING TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY AT A MINIMUM -- SO I'D SO YEAH GO AHEAD YOU AND MY WIFE I WAS PREPARING FOR THIS AND SHE HAD THE EXACT SAME REACTION SHE WAS LIKE WAIT A MINUTE I I WOULD ASSUME THIS AND KEEP IN MIND ASIDE FROM THE LEVEL OF ACUITY OF PATIENTS COMING FROM THE HOSPITAL THE RESIDENTS IN OUR FACILITIES HAVE MULTIPLE MEDICAL ISSUES AND AND AND SO THERE'S ACTUALLY A COUPLE KEY POINTS HERE FACILITIES WITH UNDER NINETY NINE BEDS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO HAVE A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN RM AND WE NEED TO CHANGE THAT BECAUSE AS YOU SAID IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT SOMEONE'S NOT FEELING GOOD WHO CAN EVALUATE THEM THAT HAS ANY LICENSED PROFESSIONAL CLINICAL EXPERTISE AND IT MUST BE A REGISTERED NURSE NOW WE HAVE TO GO BEYOND THAT BECAUSE IN LARGER SIZE BUILDINGS THERE MAY BE AN RN LOW SURPRISINGLY EVEN THOUGH IT'S REQUIRED FOR THERE TO BE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN ARE IN FOR FACILITIES GREATER THAN A HUNDRED BADS THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS HAPPEN AND AND I THINK THAT IS SOMETHING THAT REALLY NEEDS TO BE MONITORED BY THE STATE AS WELL BUT EVEN EVEN WITH AN TWENTY FOUR HOUR NURSE AVAILABLE IF THINGS GO WRONG WITH A FEW PATIENTS AT THE SAME TIME IF YOU RESIDENTS AT THE SAME TIME ONE PERSON IS NOT ENOUGH AND AND THAT'S WHERE THE POINT SEVEN FIVE ALL RAN PER TWENTY FOUR HOURS PER RESIDENT PER DAY COMES IN THAT DR HARRINGTON SPOKE OF AND YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE TO REALIZE THAT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT RENTING APARTMENTS HERE WE'RE RUNNING MANY HOSPITALS AND AT THE VERY LEAST WE NEED A REGISTERED NURSE WHO'S AVAILABLE WHO'S NOT PULLED IN MULTIPLE DIRECTIONS AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MY HEART BREAKS FOR THE STORIES I HEARD NICOLE HOW TALL AND AND OTHERS IN TERMS OF WHAT'S GOING ON IN UNDERSTAFFED THE SAUDIS RIGHT NOW THAT WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT AND DURING CODED THERE'S A LOT MORE COMPLEXITY THAN WE'VE EVER HAD IN SO THE NEED FOR THAT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN POINT SEVEN FIVE FULL STAFFING IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL IF WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE EVEN A MODICUM OF CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES THANK YOU -- YOU ALSO TALKED ABOUT THE CERTIFIED MEDICAL DIRECTOR SAID AND YOU ALSO MENTIONED THAT THE COURSE IS NOT TERRIBLY ONEROUS AND MEET WITH IS PROBABLY TECHNICALLY ONEROUS BUT AS FAR AS THE TIME INVOLVED IT'S A THREE THREE DAY COURSE HI AND -- YOU KNOW THINKING ABOUT RURAL COMMUNITIES WHERE WE'RE OFTEN IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT TO EVEN FIND A DOCTOR WHO COULD YOU KNOW WHO WOULD BE WILLING TO BE ON PAPER THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR YOU KNOW ABOUT OTHER POTENTIAL PROVIDERS WHO C° MIGHT BILL TO FILL ROLE LIKE THAT I JUST IN SOME COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW THERE YOU MAY NOT FIND A DOCTOR BUT THERE YOU KNOW MAYBE IT'S A NURSE PRACTITIONER YOU KNOW YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW BUT BUT SOMEBODY WHO COULD BE ON SITE MORE BECAUSE I MY SENSE IS THAT A LOT OF THIS IS THERE ON PAPER MORE THAN THEIR ON SITE AND AND THAT THAT'S IN THERE IT DOESN'T SOUND LIKE FROM YOUR CONVERSATION THAT THERE REALLY IN INVOLVED IN IN DECISIONS AROUND THE MEDICAL TREATMENT OF OF AS FAR AS THE TREATMENT OF THE OF THE REAR OF THE RESIDENCE IT SOUNDS MORE LIKE A AN ADMINISTRATIVE POSITION -- WHERE THEY KIND OF COME IN AND YOU KNOW SIGNED A FEW PAPERS OCCASIONALLY AND THEN AND THEN THEN THEY'RE GONNA GET SO -- YEAH IF THE GOAL IS TO HAVE BETTER CARE THE CERTIFICATION MAKES A DIFFERENCE BUT THEY'RE PROBABLY SETTINGS WHERE IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY DIFFICULT IT'S DIFFICULT NOW BUT EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO GET GET STAFF -- TO TO DO THIS JOB KNOW THAT THAT IS A GREAT QUESTION -- SOME WOMEN AND AND HAS ONLINE COURSEWORK AND THEN IT ENDS WITH A THREE DAY SORT OF WRAP UP -- THEY USED TO BE IN PERSON BUT IS NOW VIRTUAL -- BUT YOU KNOW RURAL AREAS HAVE STRUGGLED REGARDING NURSING HOMES FOR FOR AS LONG AS I'VE BEEN A GERIATRICIAN WHICH IS OVER THIRTY YEARS AND ACTUALLY BACK WHEN I WAS IN COLORADO WE WE ACTUALLY HAD A GRANT TO GO OUT TO RURAL AREAS TO TRY TO HELP PHYSICIANS DEAL WITH THEIR OLDER POPULATION AND SO THIS IS AN ONGOING PROBLEM WHETHER IT'S ACTUALLY HELPING CLINICIANS WHO GO TO THE FACILITIES OR HAVING A MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHO IS ON SITE AT THE FACILITY -- AND IN RURAL AREAS OFTEN THE PERSON WHO SEES PATIENTS IS ALSO GOING TO BE THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHICH HAS SOME OF ITS OWN CHALLENGES BUT I THINK ONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE WARM DURING COLD IT IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE TELEHEALTH TELEMEDICINE VIRTUAL AVAILABILITY IN FACT -- THE FACILITY I MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF -- BECAUSE MY AGENT AND I HAD ASTHMA AS A KID MY WIFE HAS SOME IMMUNO COMPROMISED I HAVEN'T BEEN IN THAT FACILITY SINCE SINCE THE ONSET OF KOBE BUT I HAVE CONTINUE TO INTERACT WITH THE STAFF IN IN AND IN WITH WITH THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FACILITY SO THERE ARE MANY WAYS FOR ANY IN FACT I THINK ONE OF THE SOLUTIONS HERE FOR RURAL AREAS IS GOING TO BE PROVIDING TELEHEALTH TO THE NURSING HOMES FOR BOTH CLINICAL CARE AND MEDICAL DIRECTOR LEADERSHIP AND YOU KNOW TO YOUR TO YOUR POINT MOST MEDICAL DIRECTORS UNFORTUNATELY GET A NICE STIPEND AND FOR THAT STIPEND THEY GO IN AND THEY SPEND AN HOUR OR TWO A MONTH SIGNING PAPERS THAT IS NOT WHAT THE RAGS MEANT THEM TO DO THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO THAT'S NOT WHAT WE NEED THEM TO DO AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT REALLY I FEEL STRONGLY ABOUT YOU KNOW I'M A PROFESSIONAL YOUR PROFESSIONAL IF A PHYSICIAN DOESN'T HAVE THE TOOLS AND THE TRAINING THEN THEY'RE NOT THEY DON'T HAVE THEIR OWN EXPECTATION OF WHAT THEY CAN DO BUT ONCE YOU PUT IN THEIR HANDS THE TRAINING THE TOOLS FOR SKILLS NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF POSITIONS THAT I KNOW WILL TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY SERIOUSLY AND ALL OF A SUDDEN YOU WILL HAVE MEDICAL DIRECTORS WHO ARE GOING TO GET MORE INVOLVED IN WHETHER A FACILITY IS UP TO SPEED STAFFING WISE IN ORDER TO TAKE COMPLEX RESIDENTS -- IS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND I SAID EARLY ON IN COALBED WHEN THE STATE ACTUALLY TRIED TO SEND CODED PATIENTS INTO NURSING HOMES MY MY COLLEAGUE AND I SAID WE'D STAND IN FRONT OF OUR FACILITY AND KEEP THOSE RAT THOSE PEOPLE OUT BECAUSE AS WE ALL KNOW AND THE EXPERTS NEW IN MARCH THE NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ON BRINGING HOPE IT INTO THE FACILITY IT'S VISITORS ITS STAFF ITS VENDORS AND AND SO IF YOU HAVE ENGAGE MEDICAL DIRECTOR WHO'S ACTIVELY INVOLVED WITH THE ADMINISTRATOR WITH THE DIRECTOR OF NURSING AND THEY KNOW THAT THAT PERSON IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLINICAL CARE THEN YOU HAVE AN ADDITIONAL MEANS YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL ICING YEARS BEYOND THE STATE SURVEYORS BEYOND EVERYONE ELSE YOU'VE GOT PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE GOING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION RATHER THAN PART OF THE PROBLEM -- ONE FINAL QUESTION FOR YOU IN THAT SECTOR THANK YOU THANK THE CHAIR FOR INDULGING ME HERE -- IS THE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE LITTLE QUICKLY BACK EARLIER WE TALKED ABOUT THE TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE NEED FOR TRANSPARENCY AROUND HOW THE CARES ACT MONEY MAY HAVE BEEN UTILIZED WAS THERE A FULL ARE YOU WHAT WAS IT WHAT WAS THE FORMULA FOR -- FOR WHAT YOU KNOW HOW WITH HOW NURSING HOMES QUALIFIED TO GET IT AND I BRING THIS UP BECAUSE YESTERDAY WE FOUND OUT IN OUR AFFORDABILITY THAT HOSPITALS HAD THE BEST BALANCE SHEETS GOT THE LION'S SHARE OF THE MONEY BECAUSE OF THEIR MEDICARE POPULATIONS AND SO ON YET THIS THE HOSPITALS THAT PROBABLY NEEDED IT THE MOST I DIDN'T GET THAT YOU KNOW DIDN'T GET ANYWHERE CLOSE TO WHAT THEY NEEDED YET SO IT'S THE YOU KNOW IT'S THOSE WHO HAVE THE GOAL GET MORE GOLD THAN THOSE WHO DON'T DON'T AND SO I'M CURIOUS IN THIS INDUSTRY -- HOW WAS THEM HOW WAS IT HOW WAS THE MONEY DISSEMINATED WHAT WHAT DID THAT LOOK LIKE -- DID THE DID THE THE BIGGEST WEALTHIEST SYSTEMS GET THE MONEY OR WAS IT WAS IT FAIRLY DISSEMINATED I FROZE YOU UP APPARENTLY I'M SORRY I DON'T THINK I DON'T THINK I HAD THAT POWER BUT COME BACK THE MOTIVATIONAL CLEARLY SOMEBODY DID LIKE THE QUESTION I AM THE FOR THE MARKET OKAY THANK YOU THE LION KING YEAH OKAY THAT'S REALLY WEIRD I THINK THIS IS A LIFE OKAY THANK J. THEY'RE RESTARTING THE SYSTEM RIGHT NOW YEAH AND IF THERE IS ANOTHER OKAY I DON'T DID YOU HEAR MY QUESTION BEFORE YOU YOU FROZE THERE WAS SYSTEM SIDE SHOCKING BUT NOW WE CAN'T HEAR YOU HAVE ACTUALLY HEARD THE QUESTION AND THEN IF THEN IF THEN IT FROZE OKAY ALL RIGHT OOPS HANG ON WE LOST YOU KNOW IT'S INTERESTING WHEN WHEN PERHAPS WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW GO AHEAD SO WHEN THE CARES ACT CAME OUT -- THERE REALLY WAS NO IF THEY JUST GAVE THE MONEY OUT AND THERE REALLY WASN'T A LOT OF ATTACHED TO IT -- I THINK THE LARGER ORGANIZATIONS AS YOU SAID WITH THE MOST MONEY THE MOST RESOURCES PROBABLY WERE BETTER ABLE TO ACCESS THOSE FUNDS I I ALWAYS WORRY IN THESE CASES FOR THE NOT FOR PROFITS THE THE MOM AND POPS THE SOLE OWNED FACILITIES IN ORDER WHETHER THEY'RE THEY WERE ABLE TO PUT IN THEIR REQUEST TO GET THE MONEY IN TERMS OF FROM MY UNDERSTANDING FROM TALKING TO ACTUALLY SEE STAFFERS IN CONGRESS THERE WASN'T A LOT ATTACHED TO THIS SO THE MONEY JUST CAME OUT AND AND I THINK A LOT OF FOLKS ARE BEGINNING TO LOOK AT WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED TO IT AND JUST AS YOU JUST AS YOU ARE ASKING THAT QUESTION OKAY THANK YOU WELL I GUESS WE'LL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THAT AND SEE SO DO YOU HAVE YOU HEARD IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT PLAN TO DO ANY AUDIT ON ON ON KERR'S ACTED HOW IT WAS SPENT I'VE ACTUALLY SPOKEN TO CONGRATULATE SUBCOMMITTEE THAT'S THAT'S LOOKING AT THIS AND -- I IT IS IT IS MY BELIEF THAT THEY ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THIS GREAT THANK YOU THANK YOU OKAY NOW WE'RE GONNA GO TO MISTER ZERO THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME WE CAN HEAR YOU PERFECT NICE TO SEE EVERYONE REMOTELY AND THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR HOLDING THIS VERY IMPORTANT MEETING CAN'T BE THERE IN PERSON BUT REMOTELY IDEA MY QUESTIONS ARE PRIMARILY GOING TO BE -- FOR A MISTER CORNET -- MISTAKE OR AND DR WASSERMAN -- BUT BEFORE I GET INTO IT I I DID WANT TO -- ALSO -- A KNOWLEDGE MISS CARMEN AS -- AS DID MY A COLLEAGUE FROM FRESNO -- -- I I FIND IT INTERESTING THAT SHE -- WAS INFECTED IN JULY -- AND THEN HAD THE MISFORTUNE OF CARRYING THAT TO HER FAMILY AND HER LOVED ONES AND TO HEAR ABOUT THE CHALLENGES THAT HER HUSBAND HAS BEEN DEALING WITH -- IT WHEN BY JULY WE HAD ALREADY HAD A COUPLE OF HEARINGS I BELIEVE AT LEAST ONE IF NOT TWO AND AND REGARDLESS OF THE HEARINGS WE WERE WE KNEW THE ALARMING RATES SO I AM -- I THINK IT JUST DRIVES HOME THE FACT THAT EVEN AFTER WE KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT WE HAD STAFFERS -- STRUGGLING AND -- AND I DO APPRECIATE -- MISTER CHAIR FOR BRINGING ON MISS CARMEN ALSO TO TO PROVIDE HER TESTIMONY AND HER STORY IDEA WANTED TO GET INTO A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS MISTER WOOD AND I SEEM TO KIND OF DOCTOR WOULD AND I SEEM TO KIND OF THINK ALIKE IN SOME SOME AREAS SAY PRECIADO HIS QUESTIONS AND ONE OF THE ANSWERS MISTER CORNET GAVE WAS THAT -- FOR THIRD PARTY OR RELATED PARTY COMPANIES IS THAT -- THERE IS NO PROFIT INVOLVED AND AND AND DR WASSERMAN STARTED TOUCHING ON THAT WHICH WHICH BEFORE HE WAS EVEN GONNA SAID I WAS GONNA SAY WELL THERE'S THERE'S MARKET RATES THAT YOU COULD BE SETTING AND JUSTIFYING SO HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT THERE IS NO PROFIT INVOLVED IT IS THERE SOMETHING STATUTORILY WRITTEN YEAH CAN YOU PLEASE ON ME THANK YOU YES YEAH ALL ALL FACILITIES THEIR AUDITED AND THEIR COST THE COST THAT THEY CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR AUDITED SO THE AUDITORS EXCLUDE -- WHAT THEY CONSIDER RE ABOUT -- A PROFIT ON ON THE THOSE THIRD PARTY ON THE ISSUE THE WAY FACILITIES ARE REIMBURSED THEY REIMBURSE TWO YEARS IN ARREARS SO IN OTHER WORDS RIGHT NOW WHAT THEY RECEIVE RIGHT NOW IS BASED ON WHAT THEY SPENT TWO YEARS AGO THOSE ARE ALL AUDITED AND ANY THIRD PARTY TRANSACTION LIKE THAT THIRD PARTY -- -- IT AUDITORS WILL ROUTINELY EXCLUDE CERTAIN COST THAT BETTER WORK SHOW UP ON THERE THAT THE COST AND THAT INCLUDES THE ANY PRODUCT THEY MAKE ON THIS THIRD THIS THIRD PARTY BUT BUT YOU'RE FREE TO PUT WHATEVER RATE FOR THE MONTH FOR THE STAFF A YOUR YOU'RE ABLE TO PUT WHATEVER RATE FOR THE IS THERE A CAP ON THE RATE FOR MARKET RATE ON THE -- -- UP RENTAL OR LEASE YEAH I I'M NOT SURE I CAN GIVE YOU THAT LEVEL OF DETAIL MISTER NAZARIAN I GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I JUST KNOW THAT IS HOW THE AUDITING FUNCTION WORKS THOUGH THAT THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF COSTS THAT ARE THAT ARE EXCLUDED FROM WHAT THAT FACILITY YOU KNOW CAN'T CLAIM -- AND THEN LIKE I SAY ON TOP OF THAT THEN THEN EACH OF THOSE COST OF FACTORS DEPENDING ON THE THE PART OF THE LINE ITEM IT'S UNDER THEY WILL BE REIMBURSED AT THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE MAYBE THE NINETIETH PERCENTILE WHATEVER IT IS AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT THEN THERE'S A LIMITATION ON HOW MUCH THEY CAN ACTUALLY GET BASED ON THE OVERALL IN THE LIMIT THE OVERALL INCREASE IN THE MEDIC CAL RATE SO THEY ARE CONSTRAINED AT MULTIPLE LAYERS I GET THE CONSTRAINTS THAT YOU KNOW CONSTRAINTS ARE PUT INTO PLACE SO THAT WE WE WE TRY TO YEAH WE TRY TO PROVIDE THE BEST SERVICE WE CAN BASED ON THE DOLLARS PROVIDED AND SOMETIMES THOSE AREN'T ENOUGH BUT THEN THERE'S ALWAYS -- -- WAYS TO TO TO TO MOON MANEUVER AROUND THAT -- NEATLY WE RECENTLY IN THE LIGHT AND THIS LAST TERM TOOK STEPS FOR EXAMPLE -- IN IN THE -- A PUBLIC EDUCATION CHARTER REALM WHERE WE SAID IF YOU ARE A OPERATOR OF THE CHARTER SCHOOL YOU CAN NOT OWN THE LAND THAT YOU'RE PAYING LEAST TO SO THAT THAT WAY IT CUTS POTENTIALLY ANY -- ANY ANY POTENTIAL MOTIVES OF MAY BE PAYING A LITTLE BIT MORE THAN THE MARKET RATE OR AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF MARKET RATES FOR LEASE -- ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHEN MARKET RATES ARE AT ALL TIME HIGH WE KNOW THERE'S A THAT THE I COULD NOT WOULD NOT KNOW WE ARE IN AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN IT'S JUST WE HAVEN'T FELT THE FULL EFFECTS OF IT YET AND SO WE CAN BE SETTING PRICES RIGHT NOW YET IN THE IN THE COMING YEARS THAT RATES MAY NOT BE REALLY THE RATES THAT SHOULD BE PAID BECAUSE THE MARKET ISN'T THERE SO THERE'S A LOT OF THESE GAMES MANSHIP THAT UNFORTUNATELY CAN CAN TAKE PLACE -- SO I DON'T KNOW IF -- MY COLLEAGUE DR WOULD WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS BUT BUT I THINK SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF ENSURING THAT -- HOUSING THAT THAT THAT THAT THAT -- -- OWNER OPERATORS ARE ALSO THIS INVESTED FROM OWNERSHIP OF THE PROPERTY -- UP POTENTIALLY HELPS ADDRESS AT LEAST ONE OF THESE ISSUES I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WOULD CARE TO COMMENT MISTER CORNET ON THAT -- BUT I'D ALSO LIKE TO I'D LIKE TO HEAR FROM YOU AS WELL AS FROM DR WASSERMAN YEAH I I WOULD PROBABLY NEED TO UNDERSTAND A BIT MORE WHAT YOU TALK ABOUT I WILL JUST TELL YOU THIS THOUGH DID MANY FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY LESS SO IN CALIFORNIA THAT MANY FACILITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT AND HAVE GONE BANKRUPT OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS THE CAUSE OF THAT HAS BEEN THE READS THE REEDS M. AND THE OWNERSHIP OF THE AT THE OF THE LAND THAT HAS BEEN A MAJOR PROBLEM IN MANY PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE AS THE REEDS HAVE INCREASED THE THE THE LEAST COST -- THAT IS -- SOMETHING THAT THE POLICE ARE NOT BEEN ABLE TO MANAGE -- GIVEN THAT SO I SAID BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT ANYTHING THAT WE LOOK AT HERE GIVEN THE EXPERIENCE WE'VE SEEN OTHER STATES SO YOU'VE YOU'VE YOU'VE SEEN THAT IN OTHER STATES BUT IS THAT BEEN THE ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAS BEEN AN ISSUE IN CALIFORNIA AS WELL UNDERSTAND I DON'T THINK IT HAS BEEN AS DRAMATIC IT TURNS UP AT FORCING FACILITIES INTO FORECLOSURE AND INTO BANKRUPTCY AS MUCH BUT IT IS DEFINITELY AN ISSUE HERE -- BECAUSE WE'VE SEEN THAT THE THE THE BREEDS HAVE RUN UP THE COST YOU KNOW TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY DON'T THAT IT THERE'S DIFFERENT MODELS THERE'S DIFFERENT MODELS OUT THERE SOME FACILITIES -- YOU KNOW ONE OF THEIR IT I JUST THINK OF ONE LOCAL FACILITY HERE THAT'S BEEN A FAMILY OPERATED FACILITY FOR THREE GENERATIONS THAT THAT FACILITY OWNER OWNS THE FACILITY AND ALSO OPERATES THE BUILDING TO IN MANY CASES SOMEONE ELSE OWNS THE FACILITY IT OWNS THE LAND UNDER THE DIRT IF YOU WILL AND THE FACILITY AND AND AND THE OPERATOR THAT HAS THAT OPERATES THE FACILITY AND THEN A MAJOR PART OF WHAT THEY HAVE TO PAY THEM THAT'S HAVE TO PAY THAT THE COST OF THE THE THE LEASE AND -- AND USUALLY TO A REPEAT OKAY WELL I I RAISE THIS BECAUSE I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A CLEAR DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE PERSON WHO OWNS THE PROPERTY AND THE PERSON WHO'S GETTING INTO THE BUSINESS AND IS GONNA MAKE SURE THAT EVERY DOLLAR IS INVESTED FOR THE BEST INTEREST OF THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES -- AND AND THE BEST A PROVIDING THE BEST SERVICE THROUGH A MODEL THAT DAY NO WORKS RATHER THAN MAKING SURE THAT -- -- -- VARIOUS COSTS ARE ARE ADDRESSED AND THEN THERE ISN'T MUCH LEFT FOR FOR THE SERVICES THAT NEED TO BE RENDERED OR PROVIDED IT'S A VERY CLEAR DISTINCTION FOR ME AND I I I I I AGAIN THAT'S WHY WE TOOK STEPS IN THE CHARTER ARENA -- CHAR AT EDUCATION ARENA TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT MOTIVATION WAS NOT NOT THERE SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO ALSO I'M CERTAINLY GONNA WANT TO LOOK AT -- IN THE COMING YEAR BECAUSE -- BESIDES THAT WE WE'VE SEEN THIS IN OTHER SETTINGS IN GROUP HOMES IN MANY OTHER SETTINGS WHERE THE STATE WILL PROVIDE A CERTAIN DOLLARS CERTAIN AMOUNT OF DOLLARS -- AND AND I WONDER TO WHAT EXTENT SOME OF THESE FOLKS WHO CONDUCT THIS BUSINESS ONCE THEIR PROPERTY HAS PAID OFF WILL THEN -- BUT QUITE SIMPLY EVEN EITHER SELL THE BUSINESS OR ABANDON THE BUSINESS SECTOR INTERESTED NOW TO KNOW IF THERE ARE SUCH IF THERE ARE ANY NUMBERS IN IN THAT -- BUT AREAS THAT I WAS EVEN THINKING UP BEFORE THIS HEARING SO I I'D BE VERY CURIOUS TO SEE AS WELL MISTER WASSERMAN DO YOU DO YOU -- WOULD YOU LIKE TO COMMENT ON SOME OF THE QUESTIONS I'M ASKING ABOUT THE RELATED PARTY -- COMPANIES AND AND CERTAIN PRACTICES AND AND AND THE LEVEL OF ENFORCEMENT SO THERE'S A BIT OF A TIME DELAY SO I WAS JUST LISTENING TO THE END OF THE QUESTION PLEASED THAT MISTER CORNET BROUGHT UP THE REIT'S I I COULDN'T AGREE MORE THAT THE REAL ESTATE PRESSURE ON NURSING HOMES HAS BEEN A LONG STANDING ISSUE AND IF YOU ACTUALLY LOOK AT SOME OF THE LARGE EVEN PUBLICLY TRADED NURSING HOME COMPANIES THE READS SIT ON THE BOARDS OF THOSE COMPANIES IF YOU THEN LOOK AT OWNERS OF NURSING HOMES AS WELL AS OWNING NURSING HOMES AND OPERATIONS WHEN YOU HAVE THE SAME PEOPLE OWNING THE LAND OWNING THE REAL ESTATE AND OWNING THE PROPERTY AS MISTER CORNET IS VERY SKILLFUL YOU KNOW VERY CORRECTLY POINTED OUT THEY CAN APPLY PRESSURE TO THE OPERATIONS THAT CAN IMPACT THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED AND OFTEN END UP LEADING THEM INTO BANKRUPTCY IF THE THAT PRESSURE IS TOO GREAT I MEAN THERE THERE ARE MERELY A NUMBER OF EXAMPLES OF THIS OVER THE LAST TWENTY THIRTY YEARS SO I ACTUALLY THINK A MISCONDUCT HAS HAS REALLY -- HELPED EXPLAIN THE FACT THAT THERE ARE NONE TOWARD PRESSURES FROM REAL ESTATE ON THE OPERATIONS OF NURSING HOMES THAT ARE MEANT TO BE PLACES WHERE WE PROVIDE CARE FOR VERY VULNERABLE PEOPLE AND WE REALLY NEED TO LOOK FOR A WAY OF EITHER SEPARATING OUT THIS PRESSURE MAKING CHANGES TO IT -- AND I THINK THERE'S A NUMBER OF -- IDEAS THAT COULD BE OUT THERE VERY INTERESTED TO TO DISCUSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT PRESSURE POINTS AND SEEING -- HOW WE CAN START IMPLEMENTING -- ALL OF THESE DIFFERENT PRESSURE POINTS INTO SOME KIND OF AN EXECUTE HERBAL EITHER POLICY OR LEGISLATION THAT THAT STARTS STARTS -- UNTANGLING CERTAIN INFLUENCES FROM BEING ABLE TO DELIVER THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE AS WELL I I I THINK I THINK IT WOULD ACTUALLY HELP ALSO CALF -- -- -- WITHIN ITS OWN INSTITUTION TO TO BE ABLE TO -- BABIES MAKE THOSE SEPARATIONS DOCTORS -- WASSERMAN YOUR SINCE YOU'RE OUT YOU'RE THERE RIGHT NOW IS -- YOU STARTED TOUCHING ON THE -- THE VACCINE TASK FORCE AND THE IT GERIATRIC YOU KNOW HOW MANY MEMBERS THERE ARE ON THE TASK FORCE SO THE THE GOVERNOR HAS SOME PUT TOGETHER A WORK GROUP TO DETERMINE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THE VACCINE AND KEEP IN MIND MOST THE VACCINES THAT ARE OUT THERE RIGHT THAT ARE BEING TESTED RIGHT NOW -- ONLY ONE TO MY KNOWLEDGE HAS EVEN VENTURED INTO NURSING HOMES TO TO HAVE THEM NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ENTERED INTO THOSE CLINICAL TRIALS I EVEN AMONGST THE OTHER ONES THE UPPER AGE IS OFTEN SIXTY FIVE OR SEVENTY FIVE WE DO HAVE SOME THAT DID GO UP TO EIGHTY FIVE AND THAT'S ENCOURAGING SO THAT'S NUMBER ONE FROM A STARTING POINT SO WHEN WHEN THIS VACCINE GETS APPROVED WE REALLY NEED TO EVALUATE IT AND IN ORDER TO EVALUATE THE SAFETY AND EFFICACY OF THIS VACCINE AS IT RELATES TO OLDER ADULTS WE WILL NEED COLLEAGUES OF MINE MY SEE FOLKS LIKE MYSELF WHO I HAVE EXPERTISE IN GERIATRICS AND LONG TERM CARE MEDICINE AND THERE IS NOT A SINGLE MEMBER OF THE VACCINE WORKGROUP WITH THAT EXPERTISE -- THE MAJORITY OF THE PHYSICIANS ON THAT WORK GROUP OF PEDIATRICIANS WHICH YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE PEDIATRICIANS ARE VERY INVOLVED WHEN IT COMES TO VACCINES BUT WHEN IT COMES TO OPINING ON WHETHER THESE VACCINES ARE GOING TO BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE FOR FOR NURSING HOME RESIDENTS FOR PEOPLE OVER SIXTY FIVE IN OUR OTHER COMMUNITIES WE NEED EXPERTS TO BE PART OF THAT THANK YOU MR WASSERMAN -- ON THE ISSUE OF OF SURVEYORS THEN OCCUR COME BACK CAN YOU EXPLAIN HOW YOU ARE HANDLING ENFORCEMENT RIGHT NOW ABSOLUTELY I'M SO RIGHT NOW WE ARE IN FOR SEEN BIGGEST COMPLAINT INVESTIGATIONS FACILITY WROTE HOARDED INCIDENT INVESTIGATIONS WERE ALSO DOING SURVEYS WHICH ARE STATE I'M SURVEYS WHICH ARE ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES -- -- AND WE ARE ALSO GOING INTO FACILITIES -- IF THERE ARE A HIGH RISK FOR URGENT NEEDS ARE OUTBREAKS IN THAT AND FORESEEN AND INVESTIGATION SURVEY -- WHEN NOT WORDS IT TOO WHEN WE ENTER INTO AN OUTBREAK SITUATION OKAY SO WHAT AND WHAT IS THE END RESULT WHEN SOMEONE IS NOT COMPLYING OR NOT DOING THE THINGS THAT YOU NEED YOU YOU WANT DONE OR YOU HAVE PLACED A CERTAIN PARAMETERS FOR THEM TO MEET WHAT DO YOU WHAT STEPS TO TAKE NEXT SO IF IT IS A A STATE REGULATION THEN WE WILL DECIDE FOR A STATE REGULATION IF THERE IS A SITUATION THAT WARRANTS A FULL ON INVESTIGATION THOUGH FOR LIKE A COMPLAINER FACILITY REPORTED INCIDENT THEN WE USE OUR FEDERAL REGULATIONS AND THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS ARE STRICTER -- AND -- ACCOUNTS I'M A LITTLE BIT MORE WEIGHT TO THEM THEN HONESTLY THAT OUR CURRENT STATE REGULATIONS BECAUSE OF MANY OF OUR TITLE TWENTY TWO -- REGULATIONS NEED TO BE UPDATED SO IN THE LAST SIX SEVEN MONTHS HAVE WE SHUT DOWN ANY FACILITY YOU DO HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT YEAH WE SHUT DOWN THE FACILITY HOW MANY WE HAVE DONE -- WELL I WILL TELL YOU THERE'S A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SITUATIONS SO THERE IS A REPLICATION PROCESS WHICH IS ONE WAY THAT WE DO IT AND WE DID DO A REVOCATION OF A LICENSE COMPLETELY AND PASADENA WHAT WE CALL JOINT ON TEMPORARY EVACUATIONS MEANING THAT WHERE WE HAVE WORKED ALONGSIDE WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER WERE OFTEN THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER IS DOING THE HEALTH ORDER AND WE ARE THEY ARE ON SITE WORKING WITH THEM TO EITHER DECOMPRESSOR FACILITY EVACUATED FACILITY -- AND THEN DEPENDING ON WHETHER OR NOT THE SITUATION AND THEY MAY BE ABLE TO RESUME SERVICES AND THEN ANOTHER ENFORCEMENT ACTION THAT WE'RE TAKING IS PUTTING IN TEMPORARY MANAGERS SO THAT IS A AN INSTANCE WHERE WE HAVE -- A SITUATION THAT WE BELIEVE IS UNSAFE TO THE POINT WHERE WE NEED TO INSTILL A STATE TEMPORARY MANAGER AND THAT TEMPORARY MANAGER THEN TAKES OVER OPERATIONS ON BEHALF OF THE STATE -- INTEL IN SOME CASES IT LED TO A ACTUAL REPLICATION IN OTHER CASES THEY WERE ABLE TO STABILIZE THEY HAD THEIR CITATIONS THEY WENT MOVE THROUGH A DATE AND THEN THEY WERE ABLE TO RESUME -- OPERATING THEIR OWN FACILITY AND THEN WE REMOVE OUR TEMPORARY MANAGER SERVICE BEEN MULTIPLE DIFFERENT TYPES OF I WOULD SAY ON THE CONTINUUM OF ENFORCEMENT DO YOU HAVE NUMBERS GOING BACK TO MY PRE QUESTION AGAIN BUT HOW MANY DO YOU HAVE QUAN NUMBERS ON WHERE YOU ARE WITH THAT THE THREE OR FOUR LEVELS THAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED WILL UP HOW MANY IN EACH CATEGORY YOU HAVE AT THIS CURRENT STATE SO YOU MEAN JUST FOR THE PANDEMIC PERIOD THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SINCE MARCH OKAY YES YES SO WE HAVE ONE FACILITY THAT WE HAVE DONE A FULL REVOCATION AND WE ARE GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS DO NOT HAVE OPERATIONS AT THAT FACILITY WE HAVE ABOUT THREE OR FOUR DIFFERENT FACILITIES THAT WE HAVE ENTERED INTO EITHER A TEMPORARY MANAGER POSITION WHERE WE HAVE ON HOW TO TAKE FOR THE -- THE OPERATIONS TEMPORARILY IT BUT I CAN GET THAT EXACT NUMBER FOR YOU COUPLE OF I WOULD SAY ONLY A HANDFUL OF SITUATIONS WHERE WE HAVE HAD TO I WOULD SAY AGAIN I THINK IT WAS ONLY TWO OR THREE TIMES THAT WE ACTUALLY ENTERED INTO A PARTNERSHIP LET'S SAY WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO DO AND EVACUATION OR D. COMPRESSION IN THOSE SITUATIONS I WAS SKILLED NURSING FACILITY S. OR THE NUMBERS SINCE MARCH HAVE THE NUMBERS OF OF LOCATIONS THAT YOU'D NEED TO TAKE ANY STEPS WITH I COMPETING LEADING LEADING UP TO POTENTIAL REPLICATION -- HAS THIS HAS HAS IT BEEN THE SAME THIS YEAR AS IN ANY OTHER YEAR OR HAS THERE BEEN A INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SO THAT IS THAT'S AN INCREASE IT'S IT'S UNUSUAL THAT YOU WOULD ACTUALLY HAVE TO GET TO THE POINT OF REPLICATING IT LICENSE IN FACT I DON'T THINK IT HAS BEEN DONE WHEN I ASKED MY TEAM WHEN IS THE LAST TIME THAT THIS KIND OF STANCE HAD BEEN DONE IT HADN'T BEEN DONE IN YEARS NOT EVEN FROM I THINK MY PREDECESSOR BUT MAYBE THE PERSON BEFORE THAT -- SO IT WAS A VERY UNUSUALLY -- I GUESS STRICT COURSE OF ACTION THAT WE TOOK BUT I STAND BY THAT IT WAS THE SAFEST COURSE OF ACTION AND IT WAS ONE THAT WE ALSO WERE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO TRANSFER THOSE RESIDENTS SAFELY OVER A PERIOD OF TIME -- AND -- SO WE WILL GO THROUGH THAT THAT ENFORCEMENT PROCESS AND AND SEE THIRD SEE THAT THROUGH THE ENTIRE -- A COURT PROCESS THAT THAT TAKES WAIT WAIT DO THE CLIENTS OF A REVOKED PLACE OR SHUT DOWN PLACE END UP GOING THEY ARE TRANSFERRED IT TO LOCAL -- FACILITIES -- AND WE WORK WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE SAFE SPACES PARTICULARLY WITH COPE IT'S EVEN MORE DIFFICULT RIGHT BECAUSE YOU WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IF YOU HAVE CALL THE POSITIVES THAT YOU WERE TRANSFERRED TO A LOCATION THAT ALREADY HAS A COVERT POSITIVE WING OR WHAT COLOR RED ZONE ALREADY ENACTED IN CO CORK IT APPROPRIATELY -- AND THEN IT YOU'RE MAKING SURE THAT YOU CAST INTO MEDICAL EVALUATIONS TO SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE THAT NEEDS TO BE TRANSFERRED TO A LOCAL GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL AND THEN YOU'RE ALSO DOING EVALUATIONS IN TESTING TO SEE IF FOR THOSE WHO ARE COPING -- NEGATIVES I HAVE NO EXPOSURES CAN THAT BE -- APPROPRIATELY TRANSFERRED -- AND IF YOU REALLY HAVE TO I MEAN OF COURSE OUR OUR FIRST COURSE OF ACTION IS ALWAYS TO TRY TO -- WHAT WE CALLED YOU KNOW ENFORCE AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS IT THERE IS SAFETY AT THE LOCATION -- BUT IF IT IS SO UNSAFE WE MUST BE ABLE TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH A TRANSFER PLAN -- WITH A LOCAL OFFICER BUT HOW DO YOU DEAL WITH THAT CAPACITY ISSUES IF THE OTHER FACILITIES IN THE AREA ARE ALREADY AT CAPACITY HOW WOULD YOU BE ABLE TO INTRODUCE NEW INDIVIDUALS -- IN IN IN INTO INTO INTO THE CARE OF THE ADJOINING FACILITIES SO LUCKILY WE HAVE NOT HAD THAT ISSUE THERE IS CAPACITY AND THERE HAS BEEN CAPACITY IN ALL OF THESE SITUATIONS -- AND IN FACT WITH THE CASE OF PASADENA WITH THE LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH THERE ARE PASADENA MULTIPLE TIMES -- AND DOCTOR AND GO HAS EXPRESSED THAT THEY HAVE THEY HAVE ENOUGH CAPACITY TO WHERE THEY DO NOT NEED THIS PARTICULAR FACILITY TO COME ONLINE AGAIN AND IT WAS IN A STATE I THINK EVEN JUST THE PHYSICAL -- AGE OF THE FACILITY AND THE -- -- HOW IT WAS SET UP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WOULD ENTERTAIN HAVING -- A NEW OPERATIONS AND AT THIS TIME IN THE EXACT THE WAY THAT THEY GOT ACTUAL FACILITY SET UP TODAY ISRAEL IS THE TO THE PASADENA LOCATION NOW SHUT DOWN OR OF WHILE THEY'RE GOING THROUGH THE COURT PROCESS CAN THEY STILL OPERATE YEAH IT'S COMPLETELY SHUT DOWN AND ALL OF THAT RESIDENTS ARE AT OTHER NEARBY FACILITIES WITHIN PASADENA OKAY I I I AT LEAST SINCE THAT'S THE PASADENA IS IN AND URBAN DENSE AREA I I SUSPECT THAT THE FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES WERE WORKING WITH WITH MAYBE THE STATE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR LOVED ONES ARE GETTING TO A NEARBY LOCATION SO THEY ALWAYS DID IT JUST RAISES A LOT OF OTHER ISSUES -- WHAT ARE THE CURRENT TESTING PROTOCOLS FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE LEAVING SKILLED NURSING SO LEAVING TO GO HOME OR YES SO IF A PATIENT HAS THE RIGHT OR RESIDENT HAS THE RIGHT TO BE ABLE TO JUST CHARGE -- AND SO WE DO NOT HAVE YOU KNOW SPECIFIC RULES ABOUT I AM TESTING IF THEY WANT TO DISCHARGED TO GO HOME YOU MEAN MEANING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO ACTUALLY STAY HOME NOT TAKE A PASCO HOME FOR A TIME PERIOD AND THEN COME BACK BUT WELL IN I WAS THINKING IN JUST AND GOING HOME PERMANENTLY BUT BUT BEING DISCHARGED BUT IN EITHER CIRCUMSTANCE I JUST I'M I'M WONDERING IS THERE SOME KIND OF A -- WHETHER AN INTRODUCTION OR EXIT OUT OF THE BILL OUT OF THE CONTAINMENT OF THE BUILDING IS THERE IS THERE TESTING THAT GETS DONE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT STATE THE INDIVIDUAL IS LEAVING IN SOME MOST COMMON EXAMPLE THAT WE HAVE WHERE IT RESIDENT IS LEAVING TEMPORARILY IN COMING BACK IS USUALLY WHEN THEY'RE GOING TO A GENERAL ACUTE CARE HOSPITAL FOR -- AN ACUTE EPISODE OF SOME SORT OF ISSUE AND THEN THE RE ADMITTED BACK INTO THEIR SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHICH IS OFTEN THEIR HOME SO TO SPEAK -- AND SO FOR THAT WE DO NOT REQUIRE TWO SETS OF TESTS WE WOULD JUST REQUIRE ONE TEST SO THAT THEY WILL HAVE THE RESULTS SO THAT THEY KNOW WHERE TO CALL COURTS THAT INDIVIDUAL SO IF THEIR TEST POSITIVE THEN THEY CAN GO INTO THE COVERT POSITIVE COMPORTED WING OF THE FACILITY IF THEY ARE -- CONSIDERED A EXPOSURE FOR SOME REASON FOR IT THAT THEY CAN GO INTO THE YELLOW AND TALKING ABOUT A QUARANTINE TYPE WHEN THEY'RE INTO THE FACILITY -- AND THEN IF IT WAS -- TESTED NEGATIVE THEY COULD GO INTO THE COOK THE GREENS OUT OF THE FACILITY ARE YOU FAMILIAR WITH ANY CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE SOMEONE A RESIDENT WAS LEAVING AND GOING HOME -- AND AND POTENTIALLY BENT AND MAY HAVE BEEN INFECTED AND IT WAS FOUND OUT LATER NOT IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY NOW I KNOW THAT WE SEE A LOT OF THAT AND I'VE HEARD SOME OF THOSE ISSUES MORE SO IN ON DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES CARE FOR THE ELDERLY ARSIA FEES AS WELL AS ASSISTED LIVING IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES YOU OFTEN SEE MORE PEOPLE -- OF COURSE AND HAVING THE FREEDOM TO KIND OF GO IN AND OUT ON ITS LAST SO THAT YOU WOULD SEE THAT IN A SKILLED NURSING FACILITY BUT THE RESIDENTS ARE ARE MORE IN THE ACUTE RANGE OF -- OF ILLNESS AND AND USUALLY NOT -- YOU KNOW LEAVING OR GOING HOME BUT TO THAT POINT AS WE ARE GEARING UP AND PREPARING FOR AND HOLIDAY SEASON AND A SEASON WHERE WE DO TEND TO SEE -- POTENTIAL NURSING FACILITY RESIDENTS TO GO HOME FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME A WE WILL BE AN ISSUE IN ALL FACILITIES LETTER IN THE NEXT FEW WEEKS THAT WE'VE BEEN DRAFTING PRESENTLY WITH OUR INFECTIOUS DISEASE TALKS ABOUT WHAT ARE SOME BEST PRACTICES ABOUT WHAT COULD BE A POTENTIAL WHEN THEY COME HOME OR IF THEY COME BACK TO THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IF THEY HAVE A SOME SORT OF PASS THAT GO IT THEY GO OFF ON HOW TO BEST AND MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE LIMITING THAT EXPOSURE TO OTHERS IN THE RESIDENTS K. CHANGING CHANGING DIRECTION LITTLE BIT BACK TO THE STAFFING ISSUE -- ARE YOU CONTINUING TO OFFER STAFFING WAIVERS FOR A FOR ONE YEAR SO RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A MERCHANT SEE STAFFING WAIVERS -- THAT ARE NINETY DAYS AND EACH NINETY DAYS AND EVEN DURING THAT NINETY DAY PERIOD WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO REASSESS OR REVOKE -- IF WE STILL LIKE THE SITUATION WAS ABUSED OR NOT UNSAFE SITUATION IN A FACILITY AND SO WE DO HAVE THAT PROCESS RIGHT NOW WE DO POST ONLINE ON OUR WEBSITE ALL THE FACILITIES THAT HAVE THOSE WAIVERS AND WE ARE PROCESSING THOSE AS THEY COME IN -- AND -- WE HAVE ABOUT TWELVE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHO REQUESTED AN EMERGENCY STAFFING WAIVER IN THE LAST NINETY DAYS AND I KNOW THAT WE HAD APPROVED -- ALREADY I THINK IT'S SOMEWHERE AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY OF THOSE -- AND THEN THERE ARE OTHERS THAT WE'RE REQUESTING MORE DOCUMENTATION AND -- THERE ARE OTHERS THAT WE WILL BE TO NINE -- BASED OFF OF THEIR PERFORMANCE -- IN THE LAST NINETY DAYS OKAY SO IT'S AT NINETY DAYS AND HOW MANY TIMES CAN CAN A WAIVER BE RECEIVED BY THE SAME COMPANY THERE'S NOT A LIMIT ON THESE EMERGENCY WAIVERS -- BUT AGAIN THAT WE AS THE DAYS GO ON THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES WHAT DID YOU DO IN THE LAST NINETY DAYS WHAT STAFFING -- YOU KNOW BUT AGENCIES WHO DID YOU WORK WITH WHY WHY DO YOU STILL NOT HAVE STAFFING EVEN NINETY DAYS LATER -- PARTICULARLY WHEN WE KNOW AS A STATE RAN AT THE STATE DOES CAN LEVERAGE YOU KNOW -- THE ABILITY TO HAVE ABLE TO DRAW STAFF FROM OUT OF STATE WHEREAS -- MAYBE A SMALL MOM AND POP -- -- SKILLED NURSING FACILITY IN A RURAL AREA MAY HAVE MORE DIFFICULTY LEVERAGING OR FINDING -- STATE I MEAN FINDING -- CONTACTS OR FINDING NEW STAFF THOSE ARE THE THE PEOPLE THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT FOR YOU KNOW STATE WHAT STAFFING WAIVERS BUT OTHER FACILITY SHOULD BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH THE STAFFING PLAN IN THOSE NINETY DAYS TO BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THE SITUATION ON THEIR OWN CHAU DUE TO THE COMPANIES THAT ARE ARE DO YOU DO THE COMPANIES THAT ARE ASKING FOR THESE WAIVERS DO THEY HAVE YOU NOTICED A CERTAIN TREND ARE THEY THE ONE DO THEY OFFER HAZARD PAY IN ORDER TO MAYBE ENTICE OR ATTRACT EMPLOYEES ARE THEY TRY OFFERING INCREASED A ANY TYPE OF MOTIVATION OR INCENTIVES ARE YOU NOTICING ANY TRENDS ARE YOU ASK IS THAT ONE OF THE FACTORS IN THE QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASK TO SEE IF THEY'RE ALSO TAKING THE CERTAIN APPROPRIATE STEPS IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE MAINTAINING A CERTAIN LEVEL OF OF -- OF OF CARE THAT WE'RE ESTABLISHING STANDARDS FOR WE DO ASK FOR THEM TO ROVIRA NARRATIVE AND EXPLAIN EXPLANATION OF WHAT METHODS -- THEY HAVE ALREADY TRIED ON WHETHER THAT IS WHAT KIND OF MARKETING A RECRUITMENT HAVE THEY DONE -- WHAT IS THERE YOU KNOW CURRENT GAP THEIR PAY STRUCTURE YOU KNOW SO THAT WE CAN KIND OF GET A SENSE IS THAT BELOW MARKET IS THAT OUT MARKET IS ABOVE MARKET -- AND WE ASK FOR YOU KNOW WHAT OTHER TYPES OF AGENCIES HAVE THEY TRIED IT THEY TRIED OUTSIDE OF THEIR REGION -- IF THEY'RE RURAL AREA PROCESS WE ALSO ASK IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY RECENT LAYOFFS WARRANTS THAT THERE WAS SOME INDICATIVE REASON THAT THEY THEY COULD HAVE HAD MORE STAFF HAVE YOU NOTICED IF -- IF A FACILITY IS PAYING HAZARD PAY OR INCREASED PAY -- DO THEY FALL INTO THE CATEGORY OF COMING TO YOU FOR WAIVERS YEAH THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION I MEAN THAT'S SOMETHING THAT MAYBE WE COULD SEE IF WE COULD GET DATA ON THE DATA FRONT IT -- INDUSTRY TO FIGURE OUT WHO IS DOING THE -- THE HAZARD PAY BECAUSE THAT I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE SONG TO BE ABLE TO IT OR EVEN A WAY TO GATHER THAT DATA BUT WE CAN SEE IF WE CAN TAKE THAT BACK BECAUSE I THINK THAT WOULD BE AN INTERESTING CORRELATION TO SEE IF IT'S IF THAT IS A TRUE FACTOR THAT'S ACTUALLY BEING HELPFUL OKAY WELL I I'D LOVE TO HEAR THIS FROM IF MISTER CORNET AND MR WASSERMAN ONE OFFERED THEIR THOUGHTS ON ON THESE QUESTIONS ABOUT HAS YOUR PAD LOVE TO HEAR FROM THEM AS WELL YEAH MISTER NAZARIAN VIRTUALLY EVERY FACILITY I'M AWARE OF IN THIS AGAIN THIS TWELVE HUNDRED TWENTY FOUR FACILITIES IN THE STATE I MEAN SO IT'S IT'S HARD TO KIND OF SAY THIS UNIFORMLY BUT VIRTUALLY EVERY FACILITY FACILITY THAT I'M AWARE OF IS PAYING SOME KIND OF HAZARD PAY THEY'VE THEY'RE DOING IT IN DIFFERENT WAYS THEY MAY HAVE DIFFERENT THAT WAY OF DOING IN SOME CASES PAYING A FEW EXTRA YOU KNOW OF A FEW EXTRA HOURLY DOLLARS IN SOME CASES DOING LUMP SUM PAYMENTS THEY'RE ALL CUT ALL OVER THE BOARD BUT I'M TO MINE ALMOST EVERYONE I KNOW I'M AWARE OF THEY'RE PAYING WHAT THEY'RE THEY'RE PAYING WHAT IS REQUIRED IN THE MARKET AND THE MARKET IS IS OBVIOUSLY TIGHT ALREADY AND IT'S NOW IT'S GOTTEN TIGHTER AND THEY'RE TRYING DESPERATELY TO KEEP PEOPLE ON THE JOB SO RIGHT BUT BUT THE PAIN WHAT'S THAT THAT'S A VERY RELATIVE RESPONSE THOUGH MISTER CORNET RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE PAYING WHEN YOU SAY YOU'RE PAYING IN THE MARKET IT COULD BE COULD VERY GIVEN ESPECIALLY THE THE GEOGRAPHY AND THE DEMANDS OF THE STATE SO THE QUESTION NO NOTHING ELSE YEAH GIVEN THAT GIVEN THAT RELATIVITY BUT WHAT'S YOU KNOW I I'M STILL INTERESTED TO KNOW NUMBER WISE WHAT IF THERE'S A DO I'M INTERESTED TO SEE IF THERE'S A CORRELATION BETWEEN COMPANIES THAT ARE GETTING WAIVERS AS AND AND AND COMPANIES WHICH COMPANIES ARE UP PROVIDING THE HAZARD PAY AND IF THERE IS A YEAH WHAT WHAT THE NEXUS OF THAT IS BECAUSE BECAUSE I SUSPECT -- A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE GOING TO BE GETTING PAID THE HAZARD PANDIAN FURTHER TO CONTINUE STAYING OR WILL EVEN MIGRATE BETWEEN FACILITIES BUT I I'M I'M INTERESTED TO HEAR FROM YOU AND TO SOME EXTENT CDPH TO TO VERIFY THAT THAT I WILL TELL YOU THOUGH I WOULD SAY THOUGH IT IT MIGHT SURPRISE YOU BECAUSE I'M AWARE AT THE CITIES FOR EXAMPLE THEY'VE SAID THEY'VE THEY'VE INDICATED THAT THEY PAYING SUBSTANTIALLY THEY'RE PAYING MUCH HIGHER WAGES THE PAYING THEIR ALSO PAYING HAZARD PAY AND THEY WILL GET US SOME DAYS THEY WILL JUST GET A NUMBER OF UP UP STAFF WILL JUST CALL IN AND NOT COMMAND NOT BE ABLE TO COME IN FOR IT FOR DIFFERENT REASONS THAT PART OF THAT IS THINGS THAT ARE DIFFICULT FOR THE STAFF TO DEAL WITH TO -- YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S KIDS ARE DOING REMOTE SCHOOLING I MEAN IF THEY HAVE FAMILY KNOWS ALL THOSE THINGS ARE ARE DIFFICULT ISSUES UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE AND WITH THE SHORTAGE WE HAVE IN WORKFORCE GENERALLY THIS IS JUST DOUBLE DOWN ON THE PROBLEM I HAVE TO ASK FOR A HALL PASS FOR MY WIFE ON MANY OCCASIONS I I THAT I UNDERSTAND I I -- WOULD THAT WOULD THE DOCTORS HERRINGTON AND WASSERMAN WANT TO OFFER SOME THOUGHTS ON ON THIS GOOD YEAH I I DEFINITELY AM YOU KNOW THIS GOES TO THE ISSUE OF HOW HOW WE KEEP AND MAINTAIN C. N. A.'S IN OUR NURSING HOMES AND THERE'S A BIT OF A FALSE NARRATIVE OUT THERE THAT IT'S HARD TO GET GOOD PEOPLE IT'S HARD TO KEEP THEM OKAY BEEN DOING THIS FOR THIRTY YEARS IF YOU FIND REALLY TOP NOTCH FACILITIES FIVE STAR FACILITIES YOU OFTEN FIND C. N. A.'S WHO HAVE BEEN WORKING THERE TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS SO HERE'S THE DEAL IT'S IT'S ABOUT IT'S ABOUT LEADERSHIP IT'S ABOUT RESPECT SO IF YOU HAVE THE RIGHT CULTURE IN YOUR FACILITY AND YOUR C. N. A.'S FEEL RESPECTED AND ACKNOWLEDGED AND CARED FOR AND THEN THE OTHER SIDE OF THAT IS YOU'VE GOT TO PAY THEM A LIVING WAGE IF IF THEY HAVE TO WORK TWO JOBS IT'S GOING TO BE REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO BE THAT COMMITTED TO YOUR FACILITY SO I THINK IT'S A COMBINATION OF ADEQUATE WAGES AS WELL AS -- RESPECT AND STRONG LEADERSHIP FROM THE FACILITY IN TERMS OF ABSOLUTELY RESPECTING AND APPRECIATING THE CNA'S SO I I THINK YOU KNOW PART OF THE FEMALE HERE WHEN IT COMES TO C. N. A.'S IS WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO THIS IS NOT SOMEWHERE WHERE WE JUST SAY OKAY LET'S GIVEN HAZARD PAY AND NOW THEY'RE GONNA COME AND IF THEY'RE NOT TREATED WELL THEN THEY'RE NOT GOING TO COME AND AND AGAIN I'M NOT SAYING THAT THAT THERE IS ANY NECESSARY -- ACROSS THE BOARD GENERALIZATION OF SHE AND IS NOT BEING TREATED WELL WHAT I AM SAYING IS THIS IS SOMETHING THE INDUSTRY REALLY NEEDS TO LOOK AT AND I WOULD INDUSTRY TO DOUBLE DOWN ON EVERYTHING NICOLE HOW SAID ABOUT HOW WE TRAIN THESE FOLKS AND THEN HOW AS FACILITIES WE TREAT THESE FRONTLINE HEROES -- THAT WE NEED SO SO DESPERATELY AND AND I THINK IF WE IF WE TREAT THEM WELL AND PAY THEM WELL I THINK WE WILL NOT HAVE THE STAFFING ISSUES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE AND ONE LAST COMMENT ON THE WAIVERS I'M TO ME I I GET THE WAIVERS FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE I DON'T GET THE WAIVERS AS A CLINICIAN WHEN YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING WE CANNOT PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE LEVEL OF CARE FOR OUR RESIDENTS BUT WE'RE GIVING A WAIVER BECAUSE THE FACILITY HAS TROUBLE GETTING THEM I I I AS A CLINICIAN I ATE I JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT RIGHT GET YOUR ANSWER THANK YOU AND AND MISSED THANK YOU FOR INDULGING ME I REALLY APPRECIATE -- YOU GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY I'LL ONLY HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION BUT WE SEEMS LIKE A I MEANT TO TALK TO HER YEAH YES HE YES OF COULD YOU REPEAT THE QUESTION IT'S VERY HARD TO HEAR ON THIS REMOTE SYSTEM THE QUESTION THE QUESTION GENERALLY WAS AROUND THE ISSUE OF -- OF THE -- AND AND AND OFFERING WAIVERS YOU HEY MAKE HAZARD PAYS -- AND OR INCENTIVIZE GREATER PAYS ALL RIGHT IN FACILITIES WHERE THERE ARE HAS OUR PAYS OR INCREASED PAYS TO STAFF ARE THOSE ALSO THE FACILITIES THAT THEN DO NOT REQUEST WAIVERS MY WANTED TO SEE IF THERE WAS SOME KIND OF THE INTER RELATION -- THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO NOTICE OR OR TRENDS FROM THE RELATIONSHIP THAT WE CAN NOTICE AND AND START SEEING WHO'S ASKING FOR WAIVERS AND IF THEY'RE ASKING FOR WAIVERS HAVE THE EXHAUSTED EVERY AVENUE WHICH IS ALSO INCENTIVIZING EMPLOYEES TO GET PAID MORE SO THAT THEY DO COME TO WORK AND -- SO THAT THAT WAS THE GIST OF IT THAT WAS THE IDEA SELECT SHOWTIME AND ASSIST ON UNDERSTANDING THE QUESTION BECAUSE OF THE REMOTE -- BUT GENERALLY I WANTED TO SAY THAT OF THE SHORTAGE OF WORKERS IS A FUNCTION OF TWO THINGS IN ADDITION TO SOME OF THE THINGS THAT HAVE BEEN MENTIONED IT'S IT'S A FUNCTION OF PAY OUT BECAUSE IF YOU CAN MAKE MORE MONEY AS A JANITOR OR IN IN A FAST FOOD COMPANY WITH LESS STRESS AND LESS -- DANGER OF THEN THERE'S NO INCENTIVE TO GO TO WORK FOR NURSING HOME AND SECONDLY IS THE WORKLOADS OF WE KNOW FROM OUR RESEARCH THAT NURSING ASSISTANT SHOULD ONLY HAVE A SEVEN RESIDENTS AT A MAXIMUM ON THE DAY AND EVENING SHIFT AND MAYBE TWELVE OR FIFTEEN AT NIGHT AND YET MOST NURSING HOMES AND MANY OF THEM ARE ASKING A NURSING ASSISTANTS TO HAVE TWELVE OR EVEN FIFTEEN RESIDENTS TO TAKE CARE OF SO THEY SIMPLY CAN'T GET THE WORK DONE SO IT'S IT'S EXTREMELY FRUSTRATING AND WITH THE LOW PAY OF IT IT MEANS SAID THAT'S THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT CAUSES THE SHORTAGE AND THEN WHEN YOU GIVE A WAIVER IT CREATES A SPIRAL DOWN SO THESE WAIVERS HAVE BEEN COUNTERPRODUCTIVE AND A GOOD EXAMPLE OF THAT IS OF AND ON OCTOBER NINTH AT THE WATSONVILLE POST-ACUTE CENTER RISK OF FACILITY AND THEY ENDED UP HAVING SIXTY ONE RESIDENTS THAT GOT INFECTED AND NINE DEATHS AND -- THAT FACILITY ONLY HAD THREE POINT FOUR HOURS PER RESIDENT DAY SO IT WAS BELOW THE STATE MINIMUM AND OF FIFTEEN MINUTES OF OUR IN TIME PER RESIDENT PER DAY AND THEY WERE GIVEN A WAIVER AND SO THEY USE SPIRAL DOWN ON THEIR STAFFING AND ENDED UP HAVING TO HAVE THE NATIONAL GUARD COME IN SO WE THANK YOU KNOW THERE HAS TO BE A WAY TO GET THE WAGES INCREASED WITH PASS THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS AND TO GET THE WORKLOAD DOWN I EVEN IF THAT HAS TO BE PHASED IN OVER TIME OF HAZARD PAY WOULD MAKE A HUGE DIFFERENCE ESPECIALLY YOU KNOW IN THIS CURRENT ENVIRONMENT AND WE KNOW THAT MANY NURSING HOMES HAVE A GIVEN OUT HAZARD PAY AND THAT HAS RENAMED IT HAS MADE A DIFFERENCE ALTHOUGH WE DON'T HAVE ANY RESEARCH DATA ON IT BUT JUST ANECDOTALLY SO -- -- THIS IS IS IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL OF A PROBLEM HERE AND I THINK OF I WANT TO JUST SAY THAT I THINK A LOT OF THE DALLAS THAT WE'VE HAD THE OVER FOUR THOUSAND DEATHS COULD HAVE BEEN PREVENTED IF WE HAD ASKED NURSING HOMES TO INCREASE THERE ARE IN STAFFING AND THERE'S TOTAL STAFFING DURING THE PANDEMIC AND ASKED THEM TO REALLY INCREASE THE HAZARD PAY AND THEY OVER AT LEAST THREE DOLLARS AN HOUR MORE ON OVERALL PAY IT WOULD HAVE MADE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE INSTANCE THAT ARE YOU SAID THE NATIONAL GUARD CAME IN TO A FACILITY WHO COVER THEIR COST I I DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO WHO COVER THEIR COSTS BUT I MEAN IT'S JUST A SYMPTOM OF WHAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU HAVE LOW STAFFING AND PUT THIS OTHER NURSES IN AN UNTENABLE POSITION AND THEN -- WHEN THEY GET SICK OR THEY'RE EXPOSED TO THE COLD BED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO WORK OR THEY'RE GOING TO LEAVE WORK AND LEAVING THE FACILITY WITH NO OTHER ALTERNATIVE BUT BRINGING IN THE NATIONAL GUARD AND I AM NOT SURE WHO PAID FOR THEM BUT I STE I DOUBT IF THAT WAS THE FACILITY WELL IT WAS SILLY YEAH THE FACILITY IS BUILT ANY TIME THAT WE DEPLOY EMERGENCY STAFFING WHETHER THAT'S HEALTH CORE A MERCHANT SEE -- STAFFING THROUGH OUR NATIONAL GUARD OR THROUGH ACCOUNT THAT TEAMS ALL OF OUR DEPLOYMENTS FOR EMERGENCY STAFFING THE FACILITIES ARE BILLED -- THAT STAFFING AND IS THAT BUILDING AT THE SAME RATE AS THE STAFF WOULD HAVE BEEN GETTING PAID OR IS THERE A DIFFERENCE GREAT QUESTION SO WE BILL AT THE STATE RATE THAT WE GET THOSE STATE CONTRACTS FOR AND WE PASSED THROUGH THAT COSTS DIRECTLY -- ENSUE I'M OFTENTIMES THE STATE CONTRACTS ARE VERY PRICEY THEY'RE EXPENSIVE -- AND SO IT IS DEFINITELY NOT -- IN A FACILITIES INTEREST TO -- HAVE EMERGENCY STAFFING AND AND THAT KIND OF BILL MISTER IS THERE CAN I JUST CONNECT MUCH SAY ONE OTHER THING JUST FOR CONTEXT BECAUSE I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF GOOD TESTIMONY A LOT OF GOOD POINTS HERE I WANT TO MENTION TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE MORE STAFF IN FACILITIES COULD IT COULD WELL BE A GOOD THING THAT I DON'T WANT TO QUESTION THAT AT ALL BUT I DO WANT TO POINT OUT IF YOU LOOK AT THE HISTORY OF THIS PANDEMIC IF YOU HAVE MORE STAFF AND THEY DON'T HAVE P. P. E. AND THEY DON'T HAVE TESTING THAT YOU PROBABLY STILL GOING TO HAVE PROBLEMS AND THAT BECAUSE AND THAT'S WHAT WE SAW IF YOU THINK ABOUT THE PANDEMIC WE'VE HAD FACILITIES THAT HAD VERY HIGH STAFFING LEVELS WERE ABLE TO MAINTAIN HIGH STAFFING LEVELS AND STILL HAD SPREAD BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T HAVE PP THEY DIDN'T HAVE TESTING AND THEY DID NOT KNOW BASED ON THE EARLY GUIDANCE EARLY GUIDANCE SAID THAT YOU HAD TO BE SYMPTOMATIC WHERE YOU PER SPREADING THAT WAS WRONG AND WE FOUND THAT OUT THAT THAT HAPPENED LATER ON IN ADDITION WHEN WE HAD -- EMISSIONS FROM HOSPITALS OF OF -- FOLKS WHO WERE ALREADY POSITIVE RESIDENTS ALREADY POSITIVE -- THAT WERE THERE WE WERE A SYMPTOMATIC THEY WERE SPREADING SO TO THE EXTENT WE HAVE MORE STAFF YEAH THAT THAT'S THAT THAT THAT COULD BE AN ADVANTAGE ON THE ONE HAND ON THE OTHER HAND WITH THE FUNDAMENTALS WE'VE SEEN IN THIS PANDEMIC ESPECIALLY THE FIRST NUMBER OF MONTHS THAT WOULD PROBABLY NOT MADE ANY DIFFERENCE UNFORTUNATELY THANKFULLY WE'RE IN A BETTER SPOT THANK WROTE IN A MUCH BETTER SPOT ON PP WE KNOW MORE ABOUT THAT EVERYBODY KNOWS MORE ABOUT THE VIRUS BUT THIS IS BEEN A STATEWIDE PROBLEM FOR THE ENTIRE HEALTH CARE ANYWAY CRAIG CRAIG ALL DUE RESPECT YOUR YOUR YOUR SEEING THINGS THAT RAISES A LOT OF OTHER QUESTIONS AND AND SO AGAIN I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF OF MY CHAIRS TIME -- YOU KNOW EITHER BECAUSE I I HAVE JUST ONE MORE QUESTION BUT THIS IS LEADING TO A CERTAIN OTHER AREAS AS WELL I MEAN IT YOU WHAT YOU'RE BASICALLY SAYING IS THAT IF YOU KNOW WE DON'T DO ONE SET OF THINGS THEN WE WON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT SOME OTHER THINGS THAT'S WHAT I HEARD AT LEAST THAT'S WHAT I HEARD I DON'T KNOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS HEARD THAT AS WELL BUT BUT YOU KNOW WE WERE HAVING STRUGGLES AS WE'VE HAD MULTIPLE OF THESE HEARINGS IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE SHORTCOMINGS OF OF THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND WHY WE'RE NOT GETTING CERTAIN STANDARDS INTO PLACE YOU KNOW IT OUT ONCE IF WE CAN MEET THOSE WHICH WHICH THEY HAVEN'T BEEN MET YET BUT AS WE'RE MAKING HEADWAY INTO MEETING SOME OF THOSE YOU KNOW -- I THERE'S A PART THAT THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO PLAY AS WELL AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S MEETING THESE CHALLENGES AS WELL SO HELP ME OUT HERE BECAUSE BECAUSE THAT ANSWER IT RAISED MORE QUESTIONS THAN THAN WHAT I CANCER WELL I THINK YOU HEARD THE STATISTICS AT THE BEGINNING AS TO HOW MUCH BETTER WE ARE DOING RIGHT NOW HOW MUCH BETTER WE'RE DOING RELATIVE IN TIME BUT HOW MUCH BETTER WE'RE DOING THAN OTHER STATES AND HAVE A THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T NECESSARILY ADDRESS THE QUESTION WELL IT IT DOES I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I THINK WE DON'T HAVE THOSE VULNERABLE PEOPLE PASSED AWAY ALREADY WELL WE'VE ALREADY WE'VE ALREADY WITH THERE'S ALREADY BEEN A DISSERVICE AND AND I DID AGAIN WE WE MOURN ALL THE EVERYONE HAS PASSED AWAY IN ANY FACILITY AND AGAIN AS I TRIED TO SAY AT THE BEGINNING WE CELEBRATE THE CARE GIVERS WE HAVE HERE AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT HAS NOT HAPPENED ENOUGH EITHER THAT IS THERE'S BEEN AN AWFUL LOT OF FOCUS ON THE HOSPITAL CARE GIVERS AND NOT NEARLY ENOUGH FOCUS ON THAT THE CARE GIVERS AND OUR LONG TERM CARE SETTINGS AS FAR AS WE'RE CONCERNED BUT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THOUGH IN THIS PANDEMIC SOME OF THE THE THINGS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT GIVEN WHAT WE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED SINCE THEN WE WE WERE PET THIS WAS A A PERFECT STORM FORCE FRANKLY WE HAD A PANDEMIC WE DIDN'T KNOW IT BUT NO ONE KNEW ANYTHING ABOUT THE WAS AFFECTING THE HEALTH CARE STRUCTURE ACROSS THE BOARD WE HAD NO PETE NOBODY HAD ANY P. P. ET AND WE DIDN'T HAVE ANY TESTING THOSE THINGS WERE ALL A REAL PROBLEM AND PUT EVERYONE BACK ON THEIR HEELS VERY VERY BADLY FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF MONTHS OUT THANKFULLY THINGS ARE MUCH BETTER ON THOSE FRONTS THAN THEY WERE A PARTICULAR IN THE TESTING OF THE PD IS YOU'VE HEARD ALREADY SO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND IT'S BETTER TO AN INCORRECT I I THINK I MUST TAKE EXCEPTION TO WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BECAUSE PART OF IT IS WE'RE ALSO COMING OFF OF A WHAT ONE OF THE BEST ECONOMIC PERFORMING PERIODS OF TIME WE'VE HAD CONTINUOUS GROWTH IN THE ECONOMY SO WHEN WE'RE SEEING UP THERE WAS A PERFECT STORM YES THERE WAS A PERFECT STORM BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE PERFECT STORM WAS PRECEDED BY NINE YEARS IF NOT MORE OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND BENEFIT AND SO THAT'S THE TIME WHEN WE MAKE THE APPROPRIATE PRECAUTIONS AND INVESTMENTS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE READY FOR INSTANCES LIKE WHAT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH FOR THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S WHERE I'M HAVING A BIT OF A CHALLENGE ACCEPTING THAT RESPONSE HI I COULDN'T AGREE MORE I COULDN'T AGREE MORE AND WE WERE VERY WE WERE VERY PLEASED WITH WHAT HAPPENED IN EIGHTY EIGHTY ONE THIS YEAR TO GIVE US A RATE GIVE OUR FACILITIES RATE INCREASES THEY DIDN'T COME NEARLY THEY WERE NOT NEARLY ENOUGH TO COVER THE COST SO EVEN WITH THE GOOD TIMES THE STATE HAD WE ARE PERSONALLY DID NOT SEE THAT AND AS AGAIN AS I SAY WE'RE BEING REIMBURSED RIGHT OUR FACILITIES BEING REIMBURSED BASED ON WHAT THEY HAD TO PAY TWO YEARS PRIOR TO TO TODAY -- AND GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENED ON ALL COST AND THE LAST TWO YEARS THEY'RE STILL VERY FAR BEHIND SO I BUT I COULD HURT SIXTEEN KERR WITH SO I'LL JUST ASK MY LAST QUESTION AND MR CHERRY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME A THE TIME THAT YOU HAVE -- HOW ARE WE ENSURING THAT OVERSIGHT ISN'T SIMPLY LOOKING AT INFECTION PROTOCOLS -- BUT IT'S ALSO ADDRESSING THE QUALITY OF LIFE INSIDE THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITY SO AND AND AND I WELCOME RESPONSES FROM MISS THEN OCCUR MET MISTER CORNET AS WELL AS -- DR WASSERMAN AS WELL WELL OFTEN WHEN WE ARE IN A FACILITIES TO WORK REQUIRED AND BY OUR DUTIES -- OR STATE SURVEYORS IS THAT EVEN IF WE'RE IN A FACILITY INVESTIGATING WHETHER OR NOT THERE WAS A FLY IN THE SOUP IF WE SEE SOMETHING WHILE WE'RE IN THAT FACILITY THAT WARRANTS CONCERN THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH WHY WE ENTERED THE FACILITY IN THE FIRST PLACE WE HAVE THE RIGHT AND THE DUTY TO EXPLORE THAT AND TO DO A AN INVESTIGATION ON THAT SO EVEN IF WE'RE IN A FACILITY THAT IS ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE SO AN INFECTION PREVENTION IT COULD BE A COMPLAIN TO COULD BE ANYTHING WHEN WE'RE IN THERE IF WE SEE SOMETHING THEN WE MUST FIGHT AND GO FOR IT AND I'VE HAVE IT MANY EXAMPLES OF TIMES UNFORTUNATELY WHERE WE HAVE BEEN INFORMED INFECTION CONTROL SURVEY AND WE WITNESS AND SEE BECAUSE A LOT OF THE SURVEYORS THEY KNOW THESE FACILITIES THEY'VE BEEN IN THERE MULTIPLE TIMES THROUGHOUT THE YEARS AND THEY SEE A RESIDENT WHO LOOKS LIKE THEY'VE LOST WEIGHT AND THEN THAT'S THE FIRST THING AN INDICATION IF THEY START TO DO A FULLER INVESTIGATION OF NUTRITION AND TO SEE IF THERE'S A QUALITY OF CARE ISSUE TO SEE IF THERE ARE MORE -- -- DEEPER ISSUES GOING ON THE FACILITY INFECTION -- -- THAT SITE -- INFECTION I'M A SURVEYS THEY HAVE SOMETIMES LANDED WITH WHAT WE CALL IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY SITUATIONS OR AND I J. AS WHAT WE CALL THEM WHERE WE ARE ISSUE IN IMMEDIATE JEOPARDY SITUATION THAT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PANDEMIC BUT EVERYTHING TO DO WITH POOR LEADERSHIP AND POOR QUALITY OF CARE AND SAY THAT'S JUST YOU KNOW ONE WAY THAT WE'RE ABLE TO SEE IT BUT THE OTHER WAY IS ACTUALLY PARTNERING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF AGING AND WE ACTUALLY REACHED OUT TO THE OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM AND ASK WHAT OTHER FACILITIES ARE CONCERNED WITH WHAT OTHER FACILITIES FOR YOU HAVE HAD ISSUES WITH IN THE PAST SO THAT WE COULD THEN TARGET AND PRIORITIZE VISITS THOSE FACILITIES AS WELL -- AND I THINK THE MORE THAT WE CAN COMMUNICATE WITH THE BEIJING OUR OMBUDSMAN PROGRAM EVEN FURTHER -- WE CAN BE ABLE TO DO A LOT MORE ON BECAUSE THEY WILL SEE SOMETHING IN A DIFFERENT WAY AS WELL AND SINCE -- AND WE'RE PROVIDING AS MUCH TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO GET OUR OUR PARTNERS ARE ARE INVESTMENT BACK INTO THESE FACILITIES I'M SO THAT THEY CAN -- BE EYES AND EARS AS WELL MR GERRY MCGEE TO HOLD OFF ON ONE THING -- WE HAVE TO CLOSE DOWN THE WIFI OR THE -- PUBLIC COMMENT AT SAN FRANCISCO AT FIVE PM SO THERE'S ONE PERSON IN SAN FRANCISCO WHO HAS COME TO GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT IF YOU COULD HOLD ON FROM HER IN THE LAST QUESTION LET'S LET THAT PERSON GIVE PUBLIC COMMENT THANK YOU YOUR ONE MINUTE GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT MY NAME IS FELICIA BARBATO AND I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR EIGHT AND A HALF YEARS AS A HEALTH FACILITIES EVALUATOR NURSE MY JOB IS TO ENSURE THE RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA ARE SAFE WITHIN THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES I AM ALSO A PROUD MEMBER OF SEIU LOCAL ONE THOUSAND I WOULD LIKE TO BRIEFLY DESCRIBE WHAT IT HAS BEEN LIKE TO WORK DURING THE WHOLE OF IT I HAVE BEEN WELL AWARE OF THE POOR INFECTION CONTROL PRACTICES AND QUALITY OF CARE IN MANY OF OUR NURSING HOMES PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC THE HIGH RATES OF DEATH IN THESE FACILITIES DURING THE PANDEMIC UNFORTUNATELY COMES AS NO SURPRISE WHEN I SAW WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN WASHINGTON STATE IN FEBRUARY I KNEW WHAT WAS HEADED OUR WAY SOME CO WORKERS AND I REQUESTED AT THAT TIME THAT WE BE FIT TESTED WITH N. NINETY FIVE MASKS SO THAT WE COULD BE PREPARED TO ENTER NURSING HOMES TO ENSURE SAFETY HOWEVER IN MARCH WE WERE TOLD TO STAY OUT OF THE FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SAFE FIT TESTING BEGAN FOR US IN AUGUST SIX MONTHS LATER WE ARE THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR THE STATE TO ENSURE THE SAFETY OF NURSING HOME RESIDENTS BUT BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF PLANNING AND PROPER EQUIPMENT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO GO IN EARLY IN THIS PANDEMIC TO PROTECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE I BELIEVE MANY LIVES COULD HAVE BEEN SAVED IF WE HAD BEEN ABLE TO DO SO WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT WHAT HAS HAPPENED AND CORRECT IT NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE -- ANY OF THE PUBLIC TESTIMONY IN SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE WE HAVE TO I GUESS SHUT DOWN THERE LET ME ALSO JUST THANK DR HARRINGTON FOR PARTICIPATING IN THE HEARING I I HAD A QUESTION FOR HER AS WELL BUT I'LL WAIT TO ALLOW JUST CONTACT HER DIRECTLY BACK TO YOU MISTER NAZARIAN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT THAT THAT WAS MY LAST QUESTION WHICH WAS BASICALLY YOU KNOW INSURING -- I WE'RE INSURANCE OVERSIGHT -- AND IT'S NOT SIMPLY JUST LOOKING AT INFECTION PROTOCOLS BUT BUT ALSO LOOKING AT ADDRESSING QUALITY OF LIFE AND I WANTED CORNET AND MID DR WASSERMAN TO ALL HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND WE OUGHT WE ALREADY HEARD FROM MISS US THAT OCCUR SO IF -- MISTER CORNET AND DR WASSERMAN WANNA CHIME IN I THANK WELCOME IT AND THANK YOU I DIDN'T KNOW WHO IS GOING TO GO FIRST -- I'M TRYING TO GET MY THE QUESTION REMIND REMIND ME THE TOPIC I DEFER TO DOCTOR LAST NIGHT IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS ON THAT AND THE MISSIONS AND JUST LIKE I SAID JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THE THE THE SURVEYORS ARE IN THE BUILDINGS AT LEAST EVERY SIX WEEKS NOW AND SOME CASES MORE CHECK ON THE MITIGATION PLANS -- AND AND SEE HOW SILLY TO DO IT AND SO IT JUST IN TERMS OF OVERSIGHT I'M NOT SURE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION BUT OKAY YEAH I KNOW I'M I'M GOOD I I I I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHAT THAT OUR BRAVE SOUL WAS WAS SHARING WITH US I'M YOU KNOW I I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT -- AS OF LATE MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN WORKING CLOSELY WITH CDPH WE'VE ACTUALLY BEGUN TO DEVELOP SOME EDUCATION TRAINING FOR SURVEYORS AROUND WORKING WITH DIRECTORS THE CONSULTANT PHARMACISTS -- AND SO WE ACTUALLY REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE EFFORTS AND WE THINK -- TWO MR CHRIS POINT THAT ONE OF THE CHALLENGES OF THE SURVEY PROCESS IS HOW YOU IMPACT FOR LEADERSHIP IN A FACILITY AND AND I THINK YOU BEGIN TO IMPACT OUT BY ASKING MORE QUESTIONS OF ALL THE LEADERS IN THE FACILITY ADMINISTRATOR THE DIRECTOR OF NURSING THE THE MEDICAL DIRECTOR OF THE CONSULTANT PHARMACIST AND SUCH SO OKAY I THINK THERE'S A LOT THAT WE CAN LEARN FROM WHAT'S HAPPENED OVER THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS I I THINK THERE'S BEEN POSITIVE MOVEMENT IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT HOW WE APPROACH THESE PROCESSES I ABSOLUTELY AGREE THAT -- WE NEED TO CONTINUE DOWN THAT PATH AND YOU KNOW WE CAN WE CAN FIND FAULT IN WHAT WE'VE DONE WRONG BUT I THINK WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS START FIGURING OUT WHAT WE WHAT'S NEXT IN AND I I I WILL SURE -- CAL TCM IS ACTUALLY SUBMITTED A GRANT PROPOSAL THROUGH THE CMP FUNDS TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP AND MANAGEMENT TRAINING TO A FACILITY LEADERSHIP TEAM SO AND I I FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT DURING A CRISIS LEADERSHIP IS ABSOLUTELY ESSENTIAL AND I I I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY SPACE AMONGST ALL OF US TO RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU DON'T HAVE STRONG SOLID LEADERSHIP IN A NURSING FACILITY ESPECIALLY DURING A PANDEMIC YOU'RE GONNA HAVE PROBLEMS AND YOU'RE GONNA HAVE POOR OUTCOMES SO I I THINK THAT'S REALLY ONE OF THE KEY AREAS FOR ALL OF US TO BE LOOKING AT THIS IS VERY ARE YOU WANNA DO THAT SERVICE SENATE FOR YOU ARE YOU DON'T I'M I'M DONE WITH THE QUESTIONS THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU HI I WANT TO JUST HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANTED TO GO TO MISS HOLLAND INTO DR WASSERMAN NOW WE HAVE TO SHUT DOWN SAN FRANCISCO BUT YOU ALL ADVOCATED FOR -- YOU KNOW MORE NURSING COVERAGE NURSING ASSISTANT COVERAGE INCREASE IN WAGES I THINK YOU'VE HEARD THE RESPONSE FROM MR JOYCE CORNET IN TERMS OF THE CHALLENGES AND THE DIFFICULTY AND THE SHORTAGE OF -- PEOPLE TO GO HIGHER I GUESS HOW -- YOU SEE HOW THIS RECOMMENDATION HOW WOULD YOU ADVISE US TO -- IMPLEMENT THIS AND WHAT IS STOPPING THIS FROM BEING REALITY TODD BENEFITS SO YOU I KNOW OF THAT DID TO PAY HAZARD PAY WHEN THEY HAVE A VERY SIGNIFICANT PANDEMIC THAT RESULTED IN DOZENS OF DEATHS AND THEY THEY PAID THEIR CNA'S MORE WHILE THEY WERE AN OUTBREAK AND AS SOON AS THE OUTBREAK WAS OVER THEY LOWERED THEIR PAY AND I THINK THAT SPEAKS THE WAY THAT SO MANY CNA'S ARE TREATED SO I THINK IT'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH ONE WE NEED TO IMMEDIATELY CHANGE THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE AND WHILE SOME OF IT CERTAINLY CAN BE PASSED THROUGH AS I ALSO SUPPORT WHAT HAS BEEN -- TALKED ABOUT AROUND REALLY UNDERSTAND THE THE COMPENSATION STRUCTURE AT SKILLED NURSING FACILITY WHERE THE FUNDS ARE REALLY GOING BECAUSE LET'S REMEMBER HOW THEY'RE BEING PAID IT'S THE PEOPLE'S MONEY IT'S OUR MONEY SO I THINK IT'S ABOUT TALK ABOUT RIGHT BUT REVITALIZING AND REVOLUTIONIZING HOW CNA'S ARE TRAINED FOR THEIR EXISTING JOBS I THINK IT'S ALSO ABOUT BUILDING STACKABLE PATHWAYS FOR CNA'S TOO BUT ENTER OTHER FIELDS LIKE LEN R. N. FIELDING TO REALLY LOOK AT WHAT THAT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE AND MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT HAVING THESE REDUNDANT PATHWAYS MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR PEOPLE I ALSO THINK WE THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES LOOK LIKE AS A WORKPLACE WHICH IS WHAT EXACTLY WHAT DR HARRINGTON WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS THAT TWELVE TO FIFTEEN CNA'S ON NIGHT SHIFT IS MUCH MORE AKIN TO WHAT C. N. A.'S ARE CARING FOR ON DAY SHIFT WHEN THERE IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF NEEDS WE NEED TO LOOK AT HOW FOLKS ARE ACTUALLY ABLE TO DO THEIR WORK IT'S BACKBREAKING INTIMATE AND IMPORTANT WORK AND FOR MAKING IT POSSIBLE THEM OF COURSE PEOPLE DON'T STAY I ALSO SUGGEST SURVEYING THE -- CNA'S WHOSE THEY WERE LICENSE WHO ARE NO LONGER WILLING TO WORK IN THE FIELD LET'S NOT SIMPLY SAY OH IT'S BECAUSE OF KIDS ARE ALWAYS BECAUSE OF THAT THAT'S ACTUALLY ACCESS THEM WHAT WAS HARD ABOUT THIS WORK AND WHAT WOULD IT TAKE TO GET THEM BACK INTO THE FIELD SO COULD YOU COMMENT ON JUST BEFORE THE THE SUBJECT ON THE THE SHORTAGE OF YOU HEARD MISTER CORNET TALK ABOUT A THIRTY THOUSAND PERSON -- SHORTAGE IN THE WORKPLACE AND -- I ME I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND -- YOUR -- YOUR FEELING CUENTA STORAGE DEVICE ABOUT HOW TO RESHAPE THE WORKPLACE BUT -- LET'S SAY WE COULD DO THAT HOW WOULD WE GET MORE PEOPLE INTO THAT WORK IN INTO THIS FIELD YEAH I THINK IT'S ALSO PARTLY ABOUT WE COULD LOOK TO SOME OF OUR OUR SCHOOLS WE HAVE A MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY HIGH SCHOOLS AND WE FUNNEL YOUNG PEOPLE INTO THAT FIELD WELL YOU CAN START WITH ANATOMY IN YOUR FIRST YEAR AND BY YOUR SENIOR YEAR YOU COULD BE WORKING ON YOUR CNA PROGRAM CREDENTIALS SO THAT YOU LEAVE OUT WITH ENTRANCE INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGE AND YOU'RE ALREADY SEEING A AND YOU HAVE A JOB AN EXISTING JOB IT ALSO WOULD BE THAT THE CD TRAINING CAN TAKE TIME IF YOU'RE DOING IT WELL IT'S AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME THERE ARE MANY PROGRAMS ARE ONLY A FEW WEEKS AND I HOLD THAT THEY ARE NOT APPROPRIATE OR NOT TRAINING -- I THINK IT'S ABOUT LOOKING AT THAT LIKE GOSH CAN WE DO PAID INTERNSHIPS FOR PEOPLE WHILE THEY'RE TRAINING TO BE A SENIOR I THINK IT'S ALSO EXPANDING THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AS YOU POINTED OUT IN SOME RURAL AREAS IT'S VERY HARD TO BECOME A CNA BECAUSE THERE'S NOT AND ACCESSIBLE SCHOOL I THINK IT'S A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH I DON'T JUST THINK IT'S ONE THING BUT I THINK PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HEAR YOU KNOW THE C. N. A.'S ARE MANY REPORTERS AND SO OFTEN THEY REPORT TO US ANONYMOUSLY BECAUSE THEY'VE MADE OTHER COMPLAINTS THEY'VE ATTEMPTED TO ADDRESS ISSUES OF CARE THAT THEY KNOW ARE WRONG THAT AREN'T REALLY TAKEN SERIOUSLY THE LICENSING LEVEL AND SO I THINK IT'S REALLY ABOUT SAYING THAT THE CNA YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE RESIDENT AND THEN RIGHT OUTSIDE THAT YOU HAVE THE CNA IN TERMS OF LOCUSTS OF CARE AND WE NEED TO VALUE THOSE THINGS SIMULTANEOUSLY AND HELP THEM HELP US TO RESHAPE THE INDUSTRY I KNOW THAT THAT'S A BIT OF A SORT OF A SOFT ANSWER FOR YOU BUT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO START IS THAT -- YOU KNOW UNFORTUNATELY ALL THE THE NUMBERS THE DATA WE DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH OF AN INSIGHT INTO WHAT C. N. A.'S LIVES LOOK LIKE I ALSO WOULD SAY IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT CONTROLLING THE DISEASE OF CODE IN LONG TERM CARE WE HAVE TO GET SERIOUS ABOUT THE LIVES OF WHAT OUR SENIORS ARE DOING OUTSIDE OF WORK WHICH IS THAT MANY OF THEM THEMSELVES ARE LIVING IN SORT OF A HIGHLY PACKED HOUSING WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS WERE ALSO CARE GIVERS THEY'RE ALSO STILL DOING ALL OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE TO DO LIKE GROCERY SHOPPING LIKES KIDS LIKE IF WE WANNA GET SERIOUS ABOUT CONTROLLING DISEASE IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT THE WORKPLACE IT'S WHAT WE'RE EXPECTING THAT PERSON TO DO OUTSIDE OF WORK I FULLY UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I THINK WE WE AS LEGISLATORS HAVE TO FIGURE OUT -- WHAT PROCEDURES OR POLICIES WE CAN IMPLEMENT TO REALLY SCALE -- TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM THIS IS NOT JUST AT IT THIS IS NOT JUST AN ISSUE WITH A FACILITY OR TEN PERCENT THE FACILITIES THIS IS A SYSTEMIC ISSUE ISSUE WITH IN THE INDUSTRY -- AND IN WE'VE HEARD AND WE HEARD FROM MISTER CORNET TALKING ABOUT THE YOU KNOW THERE'S ALWAYS THE CONSTANT DRUMBEAT OF MEDICARE REIMBURSEMENTS AND IF I HAVE A NICKEL FOR EVERY HEALTH PROFESSIONAL THE COMPLAINTS ABOUT MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENTS LIKE A CLOSE THE FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET GAP SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE VERY SYMPATHETIC AND I THINK YOU ARE YOUR POINTS ARE EXTRAORDINARILY WELL TAKEN BEEN ON I'M TRYING TO GET SOMETHING THAT WE CAN GO DO RIGHT SO I THINK THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE BECAUSE I I MEAN I I TOTALLY AGREE WITH YOU I THINK WHAT YOU SAY MAKES SENSE BUT HOW DO WE HOW WE SCALE THAT HOW DO WE GROW THAT DISTANCE VERSES JUST YOU KNOW HAVING HAVING A GREAT STORY AND HAVING YOU KNOW THIRTY -- YOU KNOW THIRTY PEOPLE BEING IMPACTED WHICH I'M NOT SAYING IT'S NOT A PORT IT IS VERY PARK THAT'S HOW YOU DO THINGS BUT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU HAVE HIM TWELVE HUNDRED FACILITIES AND HAVE A SHORTFALL THAT EACH OF THOSE AND THIS FUNDING ALL ACROSS THE STATE HOW DO HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT SO SIR I WOULD SAY I HAVE A PLAN FOR THAT LIKE I WE HAVE A PROGRAM THAT IS REPLICABLE ACROSS THE STATE TO ALLOW MORE QUALIFIED CNA'S TO ENTER THE FIELD IT REQUIRES A FINANCIAL INVESTMENT OF TRAINING IT REQUIRES WRAPAROUND SUPPORT SERVICES FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR CHOIRS US LOOKING OUR REGULATORY EDUCATION SYSTEM TO KNOCK DOWN SOME ARTIFICIAL BARRIERS IN ITS PLACE SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THE WAY I'D FOLLOW UP IS I'D LIKE TO SHARE THE CURRICULUM THAT I HAVE WITH YOU AND SHARE OUR OUTCOMES ACTUALLY EVALUATED BY A FIRM AND TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE SO I THINK IT'S MULTI PRONGED BUT I THINK IT'S A CONTINUING CONVERSATION OF IF I HAVE PERMISSION TO REACH OUT TO YOUR STAFF TO SHARE THIS WITH THEM AND TO CONTINUE THIS CONVERSATION OF HOW IT CAN BE REPLICATED ACROSS THE STATE YOU YOU'RE MORE THE COMMISSION WOULD WELCOME IT AND HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST SO I CAN TELL YOU WHAT IT COSTS ON A LOCAL LEVEL AND THAT'S ENTIRELY NEW ONES BASED ON WHAT THE ADULT EDUCATION STAFF ARE PAID -- AND ALSO THIS TO WHAT WE ALSO ARE SUPPORTED BY A JOHN MUIR COMMITTEE HEALTH FUND FOR THE SHORT TERM AT THE STATE LEVEL I HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT I WOULD SAY I DON'T THINK IT'S ACTUALLY MORE EXPENSIVE THAT WERE ALREADY PROVIDING FOR PEOPLE IN TWO WAYS FIRST OF ALL IN TERMS OF THERE'S ALREADY WE OWE IT DOLLARS BEING ALLOCATED TO ADULT EDUCATION AND -- SUPPORT OF EDUCATION SERVICES I THINK IT'S ABOUT SPECIFICALLY YOU'RE MARKING THOSE FOR ENTRY INTO A LIGHT HOMEOWNERS WITH THIS IS THIS IS BUDGET COMMITTEE WHATEVER PEOPLE GIVE ME WORDS LAST FOR A NUMBER I JUST NEED A NUMBER WITH THE NUMBER NOT BECAUSE IT'S BECAUSE WHEN YOU PUT WORDS INTO A BUDGET THAT MEANS YOU GOT ZERO MONEY SO YOU COULD GET THAT IF YOU WANT TO WITH HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE TALKING I DON'T KNOW I HAVE TO GO BACK AND LOOK AT THAT I CAN MAKE UP A NUMBER BUT IT'S A HUNDRED PERCENT MADE UP AT THIS POINT WELL THAT'S NOT BOCANEGRA NUMBER TWO SO OKAY I WILL GIVE A SENSE OF HOW MUCH IT IS PER PERSON IT ALSO JUST JUST SO YOU KNOW YOU MENTIONED SORT OF ADULT ED JUST REALIZE THAT WE'VE WE'VE WE'VE IN MANY WAYS STARTED TRANSITIONING ADULT AT INTO COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE WE HAD THAT DEBATE VERSES -- ADULT ED IN EITHER K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS ARE HIGH SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN OUR L. AND THAT YOU KNOW KIDS ARE TAUGHT DISTRICTS AND ADULT AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THE REASON WE TRANSITIONED AND AND I THINK YOUR POINT'S WELL TAKEN BUT THE REASON WE TRANSITION IS DURING THE LAST RECESSION WHEN K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS HOW TO MAKE A CHOICE BETWEEN CUTTING K. THROUGH TWELVE PER ADULT THAT THEY UNIFORMLY ACROSS THE BOARD CUT ADULT THAT SO THAT'S WHY WE DECIDED TO KIND OF KEEP IT WITH COMMUNITY COLLEGES SINCE THEY SERVE ADULTS ARE MORE SO I KNOW I WOULD CHANGE IS YOUR OPINION OF TIME WELL I WOULD SAY DURING THE THE SCHOOL WE WORK WITH DURING THE LAST RECESSION WHAT THEY ACTUALLY SAW PEOPLE FLOCKING TO SEE IN A PER TRAINING PROGRAMS BECAUSE THOSE WERE JOBS THAT IT WERE HAD OPENINGS AND THAT COULD BE FILLED AND PEOPLE WHO DONE OTHER JOBS INCLUDING PROFESSIONAL YOU KNOW A MANAGEMENT LEVEL REALLY NEEDED TO WORK SO IN TERMS OF STUDENT COSTS IT'S BETWEEN EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED PER STUDENT DEPENDING ON A COUPLE VARIABLES BUT THAT COVERS FOOD COMPREHENSIVE SUPPORT SERVICES AT TRAINING -- SO I HEAR YOUR POINT AROUND THE ALIGNMENT BUT I ALSO THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT BOTH COMMITTEE COLLEGE AND ADULT EDUCATION THOSE FUND -- BUT IN THE BUDGET BUT I INVITE YOU TO TALK TALK TO MISTER CORNET WHO'S RIGHT NEXT TO YOU BESIDES BEING THE YOU KNOW CO THE THEIR HEALTH FACILITIES HE'S ALSO A BUDGET GROW SO HE CAN HE CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT PARTICULAR YOU JUST YOU JUST HEARD IS A THIRTY THOUSAND PERSON SHORTAGE AND YOU HAVE A PLAN TO SCALE THAT I THINK IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY -- THERE ARE OTHER FIELDS WE HAVE PLENTY OF INDUSTRIES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE A SHORTAGE ROUGHLY DOING WHAT WE CALL IT THIS YEAR THIS MAGICAL TRANSITION SO THIS IS NOT WHAT WE'RE HEARING IN THIS HEARING AND I REALLY WOULD URGE YOU KNOW THE TWO OF YOU TO TALK ALSO FOR OUR MARKET FOR YOU TO TALK WITH OUR COMMITTEE WOULD BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO UNDERSTAND HOW TO YOU KNOW HOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS I'M NOT A DOCTOR ONCE AGAIN JUST GOING BACK TO YOU YOU JUST THE SAME SAME KIND OF QUESTION YOU MENTIONED YOU KNOW MORE MORE ARE IN COVERAGE MORE COVERAGE MORE RESOURCES HOW DO WE HOW HOW DO WE DO IT I ASSUME IF THE THE FACILITIES HAD THE MONEY TO DO THE STATE ALREADY BE DOING IT SO HOW DOES THIS BECOME A REALITY OKAY OKAY -- CAN YOU HEAR ME OK WE CAN HEAR YOU GREAT HAVING A LITTLE FEEDBACK HERE WE GET OKAY SO ACTUALLY I WANNA FRAME THIS TWO WAYS FIRST THE NURSING HOME INDUSTRY IS AT AN INFLECTION POINT RIGHT NOW AND WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING AND AND ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES I'LL GIVE YOU -- IS WHAT ASSEMBLY MAN WHAT DID WITH HIS BILL WE RECOMMENDED THE SECOND WEEK OF MARCH THAT EVERY NURSING HOME IN THE STATE HAVE A FULL TIME INFECTION PREVENTION NEST AND I WILL TELL YOU WHAT WE HEARD FROM VARIOUS FOLKS WAS WE CAN'T AFFORD THAT AND MY RESPONSE WAS YOU CAN'T AFFORD NOT TO THERE IS SOMETHING CALLED INVESTING IN QUALITY SHOW THAT YOU HAVE BETTER OUTCOMES IN YOU SAVE MONEY AND SO ON I I QUESTION THE PREMISE THAT CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN STAFFING NECESSARILY ARE GOING TO LEAD TO A NET LOSS OF MONEY AND YOU KNOW WE HAVE NOT FOR PROFITS THAT DO DO FINE AND SO I HONESTLY THINK THE INDUSTRY NEEDS TO LOOK IN THE MIRROR AND DECIDE AS AS BOTH MISTER NAZARIAN WOULD MENTIONED WHERE DOES THE REAL ESTATE FLOW WHERE THE FUNDS FLOW I SAID I SAID IN THE ASSEMBLY HEARING TO THE HEALTH COMMITTEES BACK IN JUNE THE LARGE NURSING ON CHANGE IN THIS STATEMENT CROSS THE COUNTRY COULD EASILY HAVE LEVERAGED THEIR ASSETS TO ACQUIRE ABUNDANT P. P. E. N. TESTING IN MARCH AND APRIL WHEN THE EXPERTS WERE SAYING THAT'S WHAT WE NEEDED THEY HAD NO FIDUCIARY RESPONSIBILITY TO DO THAT AND THEY DIDN'T ACTUALLY I ONLY TAKE A STEP ON THE FLOOR THERE ARE SOME DARK OPERATORS DR ONE DID SORRY ARE YOU JUST SAYING THEY THEY COULD THEY COULD BRING IN MORE PEOPLE NOW THEY'RE JUST CHOOSING NOT TO BECAUSE OF PROFIT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SEEN THE SAME AMOUNT OF CONSTRUCTION RATES ARE PROBLEMS IN THE NONPROFIT SECTOR THAT IN ESSENCE MAY BE DEALING WITH EVEN UP FOR CLIENTELE SO THAT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING WE COULD DO IT RIGHT NOW IS JUST THE PROFIT MOTIVES GETTING IN THE WAY DISTRICT UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND ACTUALLY THE DATA THERE IS DATA SHOWING -- FEWER OUTBREAKS FEWER DEATHS IN NOT FOR PROFITS VERSUS FOR PROFIT AND LOOK I'M AN ENTREPRENEUR I I BELIEVE IN THE PROFIT MOTIVE ABUSE THAT PRIVILEGE AND I I THINK THE INDUSTRY REALLY HAS TO TAKE A HARD LOOK AT HOW MUCH MONEY IT WANTS TO MAKE AND WHERE IT WANTS TO MAKE IT AND THAT'S WHERE ALL THE OTHER TRANSPARENCY ISSUES COME IN AYE I DON'T THINK THE STATE SHOULD HAVE TO SPEND EXTRA MONEY IN IN IN FACT THE REASON WE RECOMMENDED THAT FULL TIME INFECTION PREVENTION IS BACK IN MARCH WAS IT THAT WOULDN'T COST THE STATE A CENT AND IN FACT IT WOULD TAKE PEOPLE THAT THE NURSING HOMES ALREADY HACKED BECAUSE EVERY NURSING HOME ALREADY HAS AN INFECTION PREVENTION NEST IT'S JUST THAT THEY'RE TYPICALLY PULLED IN TWELVE DIFFERENT ELECTION DIRECTIONS AND NOT ALLOWED TO DO THEIR JOB AND TO BE TO BE VERY HONEST IN A LOT OF WAYS THERE WAS JUST RESISTANCE BECAUSE FOLKS DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT YOU HAVE TO INVEST IN DOING THE RIGHT THING AND PROVIDING QUALITY CARE IN ORDER TO BE PROFITABLE THAT IS WHAT I BELIEVE AND I I THINK THAT IS THAT IS SORT OF A MANTRA I BELIEVE IN AND I TOO WOULD BE HAPPY TO SPEND TIME WITH YOUR STAFF TO IN TERMS OF I LOVE NUMBERS -- SO I AND I I DO BELIEVE THAT THIS INDUSTRY CAN SURVIVE BUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE TO MAKE A HUGE DECISION IN TERMS OF HOW MUCH PROFIT AND WE'RE THAT PROFITS GOING TO BE IF THEY DO WANT TO SURVIVE THANK YOU DR OSMAN JUST FOR ONE SECOND I DON'T HAVE MORE QUESTIONS BUT WE'VE HAD SOME VERY PATIENT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO HAVE TO LEAVE -- SO I AM GOING TO GO OUT OF ORDER AND ALLOW PEOPLE FOR PUBLIC COMMENT TO COME ON UP IN THE ROOM AND FORTY TWO OR TWO ONE LOOKING AT THE PUBLIC IN PEOPLE WON'T COME UP COME UP COME TO THE MIKE IT WILL GIVE YOU WILL GIVE ME A MINUTE AND I'LL CONTINUE MY QUESTIONS GO GO AHEAD SIR FIND NJ AND PROFESSOR -- AND SOMEONE CHIANG AND THEN THE REST OF THE COMMITTEE AND MY NAME IS PATRICK BANKER AND THE OTHER IN SACRAMENTO I AM I SHOULD SAY FUNDED YOUNG PERHAPS YOUR GRANDMA HAD YOU PAINT A STROKES AND PLACE LITTLE GIVES IN THE LAKES THREE TO FIND IN THE BACKYARD PERHAPS YOUR GRANDMOTHER WAS AS BEAUTIFUL AS MINE PERHAPS HE HE SHARED FOOD AND SANG TOGETHER MY GRANDMOTHER PASSED AWAY BEFORE I EXPERIENCED SOME HARDSHIPS ON IT'S EMBARRASSING TO SAVOR BASICALLY I WAS TORTURED FOR ELEVEN MONTHS STRAIGHT TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SIX MONSTER TWENTY FOUR SEVEN CABLE BROKE INTO MY APARTMENT PUT SERVICES ON THE GROUND FOR THE TOP OF A DRUG ON MY DOORKNOB WHICH BASICALLY TORTURED ME WITH SOME KIND OF THE BRAIN VIRUS I DON'T KNOWS DIFFICULT IS MORE DIFFICULT THAN I CAN EVEN DESCRIBE ON BUT I JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT ON -- I'M NOT SURE ABOUT A GIVEN A MEDICATION ARE THE VACCINES TO THE ELDERLY BECAUSE I'M NOT I'M JUST I FEEL LIKE MAYBE WE SHOULD MAYBE CONTENT AND BETTER UNDERSTAND ABOUT WHAT'S ALL IN IT BECAUSE I THINK THERE MIGHT BE SOME KIND OF BIO TECHNOLOGIST MAYBE AND I NOT TRYING TO BLAME ANYBODY I'M NOT MAD AT ANYONE I KNOW THE DOCTORS ARE PERFECT THE WAY GOD MADE HIM I THINK ALL PER THE WAY GOD MADE YET I THINK WE ALL ARE ON I JUST THINK PARTY IN TURKEY'S PART OF MAYBE MAKE MISTAKES BECAUSE SOMETIMES WE GO THROUGH LIFE AND PEOPLE CAN TELL US WHEN I GET ENOUGH BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GOOD LOOKING ENOUGH THAT'S ME OR RICH ENOUGH THAT'S MAYOR SMART NOTHING I DON'T YA OTHER THAN THAT BUT I KNOW THAT'S ME AND I THINK IF YOU IF YOU COULD WRAP UP PLEASE I THINK ROCK ENOUGH TO MAKE ON MADE US AND ON AND ON AND TO THE PERSON TO THE PEOPLE RESPONSIBLE FOR HAVING GONE THROUGH I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY ON MAYBE WE CANNOT WORK ON BUILDING A CULTURE WHERE ALL PEOPLE CAN CAN BE THEIR BEST AND I THINK ALL OF YOU WHO WHOEVER IS RESPONSIBLE I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO BASK IN WHAT YOU DO IN YOUR PRIMARY CREATED TO AND LIKELY TO DELIVER YOUR FEEDBACK CALMLY RESPECTIVELY AND IN PERSON -- AND IT'S NOT I'M NOT WILLING TO LISTEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK APPARENTLY GOTTEN ANYTHING WE THANK YOU CHRISTIAN ANY OTHER PUBLIC COMMENT A MINUTE THAT'S WHAT I GET AND I APPRECIATE THE FLEXIBILITY AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I CAN BE HEARD AND THAT I CAN BE SEEN THERE I AM I I FREQUENT THIS ROOM WELCOME TO DAY TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT OF FLATTENING THE CURVE IT IS EVIDENT YOU HAVE CONTINUED ON THIS PATH TO ENSURE RECEIPT OF CARES AND OTHER GRANT FUNDING I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT WE ARE NOT INTERESTED IN KERR'S MONEY BECAUSE CARE IS MONEY IS BLOOD MONEY IT IS THE BLOOD MONEY OF OUR SMALL BUSINESS IS DYING AND THE FORCED ISOLATION OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE THE ELDERLY AND OTHER POPULATIONS IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES NO AMOUNT OF MONEY IS WORTH THE SACRIFICE THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR HEALTH STATISTICS EMPHASIZED THAT MOST DEATHS ARE NOT BICYCLE THAT BUT WITH COLD IT THE STATE HAS COMBINED THE DATA SETTING THE RATES BY COLD IT ARTIFICIALLY HIGH ONLY SIX PERCENT OF THOSE DEATHS HAD NO COAL MORBIDITY ON THEIR DEATH CERTIFICATES IN ADDITION THE PCR TEST FURTHER INFLATES THE POSITIVITY RATES DUE TO FALSE POSITIVES WE ARE ISOLATING PEOPLE TO THE POINT WHERE THEY ACTUALLY WANT TO DIE HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY WILL BE OKAY WITH THIS CASES ARE NOT ILLNESSES THIS IS THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY WE HAVE TESTED HEALTHY INDIVIDUALS FOR TRACES OF THE VIRUS AND USE THESE TESTS AS RATIONALE TO DECIMATE OUR ECONOMY AND PREVENT PEOPLE FROM EXPERIENCING LOVE JOY AND CONNECTION FRANKLY I'M HORRIFIED BY THE LANGUAGE I'M HEARING ABOUT PEOPLE NEEDING TO SUBMIT TO THE FLU SHOT AND THE COVERT SHOT MANDATED MEDICINE IS A DISGRACE NOW AND FOREVER WE KNOW THIS FROM HISTORY AND THIS IS WHY WE HAVE SIGNED TREATY AFTER TREATY EDIFYING THE IMPORTANCE OF INFORMED CONSENT THERE IS NO MORE BASIC LIBERTY LIBERTY THEN THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHAT GOES INTO OUR BODIES THE UNIVERSAL DECLARATION OF HUMAN RIGHTS WAS ADOPTED IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT AFTER WORLD WAR TWO IN RESPONSE TO ITS MEDICAL AND ETHICAL HORRORS SIMILARLY THE NUREMBERG CODE IN TWO THOUSAND AND FIVE ON BEHALF OF GLOBAL CONSENSUS YOU COULD RUN WHICH INVOLVES ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY THREE COUNTRIES INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES DECLARATION ON BIOETHICS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARTICLE SIX ONE CONSENT DECLARES ANY PREVENTATIVE DIAGNOSTIC AND THERAPEUTIC MEDICAL INTERVENTION IS ONLY TO BE CARRIED OUT WITH THE PRIOR FOR AND YOU MIGHT YOU MIGHT WE GAVE YOU MORE THAN YOUR TIME THANK YOU WE ALSO ALLOWED YOU TO GO OUT OF ORDER SO THANK YOU IN AGAIN THE PUBLIC COMMENT WE'RE ASKING FOR IS ON THE BUDGET COMMITTEE HEARING THERE IS HAPPY TODAY WHICH IS A HEATED OVERSIGHT HEARING AROUND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES THANK YOU NEXT PERSON GOOD AFTERNOON I'M LISA COLEMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION AND I THINK THE LEGISLATORS FOR BRINGING AND KEEPING THEIR EYES ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES THIS CONTINUES TO BE MY PASSION AND AND I'M GLAD IT'S YOURS NOW TO I DID WANT TO SPEAK TO US ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANG IN A SPECIFIC QUESTION ON NUMBERS SO WE'RE EARLIER WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE VA HOT -- VA FACILITIES AND HOW THEY HAVE A VERY LOW RATE OF CODE IN THEIR FACILITIES THEY ALSO HAVE A VERY LOW RATE OF SEEN A TURNOVER THEY HAVE A VERY -- LONGEVITY OF THEIR STAFF THEY'RE PAID STATE WORKERS AND WITH STATE WORKERS THEY GET BENEFITS AND SO WE'RE WE'RE MAKING THAT CONNECTION AND I DON'T THINK ANYBODY HERE WOULD ARGUE THAT A VA HOSPITAL GETS RICHLY PAID ON A PER DIEM ON A DAILY BASIS SO SO THERE'S DOLLARS TO COMPARE WHERE DOES THIS NEED FOR THIRTY THOUSAND CNA'S COME FROM TWO YEARS AGO WHEN THE WHOLE WAIVER PROGRAM FOR STAFF SHORTAGES WAS FIRST BROUGHT UP THE NUMBER WAS FOURTEEN THOUSAND WE ONLY HAVE TWELVE HUNDRED SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WHERE DOES THIS HUGE NUMBER COME FROM SO I DO THINK THAT THE CALL HOUSE PROGRAM IS AMAZING I'VE TALKED WITH THOSE FOLKS ONE OF THE THINGS IN THE BUDGET COMMITTEE I KNOW IT'S VERY DIFFICULT FOR YOU IN GENERAL IS WE SPEND MONEY OVER HERE BUT WE DO NOT SEE HOW WE'RE SAVING MONEY OVER HERE I HAVE MET WITH MANY OF HER -- PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS IF THEY WEREN'T IN THIS PROGRAM LEARNING A SKILL WE WOULD BE PAYING FOR THEM ON WELFARE WE WOULD BE PAYING FOR THEM IN OTHER WAYS INCARCERATIONS AND IN OTHER -- SOCIAL SERVICES THERE IS PRIDE IN DOING A JOB WELL DONE AND I THINK THIS IS A PROGRAM THAT SHOULD BE INVESTED IN ACROSS THE STATE THANK YOU NEXT BE REPLACED GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS THANK YOU UP FOR CONVENING THIS REALLY IMPORTANT HEARING -- MY NAME IS ALEXANDRA SMITH DAVIS I'M WITH LEADING AGE CALIFORNIA SENIOR CARE PROVIDERS INCLUDING SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES I'LL BE BRIEF BECAUSE I THINK

HOURS I MEAN YOU GUYS HAVE BEEN TALKING FOR LITERALLY HOURS BUT I DO HAVE TO KNOW WHICH WOULD BE THINGS THAT ARE WORTH MENTIONING ONE IT IS SO COLD IN HERE I HAVE BEEN FREEZING THE ENTIRE TIME AND I THINK SOMEONE SOMEWHERE SHOULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT NUMBER TWO FRANKLY WE ARE NOT GOING TO HAVE TOO MANY MORE LIVING MEMBERS OF THE BLOOMERS THE EX WHAT THE SILENT GENERATION IF YOU DO NOT STOP THIS I DON'T HAVE A BETTER WAY TO DESCRIBE THIS OTHER THAN STOP THE LINES THE MEDIA MANIPULATION THE IMMENSE CORPORATE THE CATASTROPHE DESTRUCTION THAT A VACCINE IS GOING TO MAGICALLY ON DUTY FOR THE FACT THAT OUR GOVERNOR TARGETED NURSING HOMES TO MURDER SO MANY VULNERABLE RESIDENTS BY STUFFING COBIT CONTAMINATED PEOPLE IN WITH THE ELDERLY THANK YOU ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE PUBLIC OKAY SEEING NONE

ABOUT WHERE THAT THIRTY THOUSAND -- NUMBER CAME FROM BUT THEN ALSO JUST THE FEEDBACK IN TERMS OF -- THE INDUSTRY IN TERMS OF TREATING WORKFORCE BETTER -- YOU KNOW BETTER WAGES THAT THE QUESTION IS IS ON THE WAGES LOWER THAN THAT THEN THEY THEN THEY SHOULD BE BECAUSE THAT YOU KNOW THE INDUSTRY THE FOR PROFIT INDUSTRY VERSUS THE NONPROFIT INDUSTRY IF YOU COULD ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE ISSUES SURE SURE YEAH THE THAT THAT NUMBER'S REALLY FROM AUST POD -- SO YOU KNOW THE DYNAMIC NUMBER BUT THAT'S FROM FROM YOU KNOW THE STATE AGENCY THE STATE WHAT THE THAT COLLECTS THAT DATA DOES THOSE ANALYSES SO YOU
