00:14:22.895 --> 00:14:24.763
FUTURE CASE IN POINT.

00:14:24.830 --> 00:14:26.165
WE ARE APPROACHING THE ONE

00:14:26.232 --> 00:14:27.633
HUNDREDTH ANNIVERSARY.

00:14:27.700 --> 00:14:29.168
OF THE NINETEENTH AMENDMENT

00:14:29.235 --> 00:14:40.179
GIVING WOMEN THE RIGHT TO VOTE.

00:14:40.246 --> 00:14:41.513
GENERATIONS FOUGHT FOR THIS

00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:43.682
RIGHT AND ITS IMPORT CANNOT BE

00:14:43.749 --> 00:14:45.517
OVERSTATED BECAUSE THE RIGHT TO

00:14:45.584 --> 00:14:46.919
VOTE.

00:14:46.986 --> 00:14:48.687
IS THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE.

00:14:48.754 --> 00:14:50.656
IS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE AND

00:14:50.723 --> 00:14:52.191
IT'S THE RIGHT TO BE HEARD.

00:14:52.258 --> 00:14:53.158
ALL ARE NECESSARY ELEMENTS IF WE

00:14:53.225 --> 00:14:56.996
ARE TO OUR BIRTHRIGHT TO JUSTICE.

00:14:57.062 --> 00:14:59.465
MANY OF US ARE HERE TODAY

00:14:59.531 --> 00:15:00.933
BECAUSE OF THE SACRIFICE AND

00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.835
DETERMINATION OF THOSE PAST

00:15:02.901 --> 00:15:04.270
GENERATIONS.

00:15:04.336 --> 00:15:06.105
SO TODAY IN SPEAKING TO YOU

00:15:06.171 --> 00:15:07.773
ABOUT THE STATE OF THE JUDICIARY

00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:09.308
I START WITH THE FACT.

00:15:09.375 --> 00:15:11.944
THAT ABOUT ONE THIRD OF OUR

00:15:12.011 --> 00:15:13.879
JUSTICES AND JUDGES ARE

00:15:13.946 --> 00:15:15.180
RELATIVELY NEW TO THEIR

00:15:15.247 --> 00:15:16.849
POSITIONS.

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:18.284
THANKS TO GOVERNOR BROWN WHO

00:15:18.350 --> 00:15:19.918
BREATHE NEW LIFE INTO THE

00:15:19.985 --> 00:15:22.421
JUDICIARY WITH SIX HUNDRED PLUS

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:24.290

HUNDRED OF THOSE IN HIS FINAL

00:15:25.257 --> 00:15:27.459

00:15:27.526 --> 00:15:29.161
IN THE LAST YEAR THESE NEW

00:15:29.228 --> 00:15:32.231

AND OVER HALF OF THESE

00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:36.835
APPOINTMENTS ARE FEMALE.

00:15:36.902 --> 00:15:38.504
THIS IS TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE

00:15:38.570 --> 00:15:40.472
JUDICIARY NOW IS MORE

00:15:40.539 --> 00:15:42.041

OUR GOALS AND OUR PLANS AND WE

00:15:59.124 --> 00:16:01.293

THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE SERVE.

00:16:33.492 --> 00:16:35.327
REMOTE ACCESS MEANS ONLINE

THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND USE IT

00:16:57.349 --> 00:16:58.450
STATE WIDE.

00:16:58.517 --> 00:17:00.185
THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY INCLUDES

00:17:00.252 --> 00:17:02.221

STATEWIDE FOR OTHER COURTS.

00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:24.309
BECAUSE IMPROVING ONLINE ACCESS

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:25.511
TO JUSTICE IT MAKES SENSE IN

00:17:25.577 --> 00:17:27.913
CALIFORNIA MANY CALIFORNIANS

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:29.581
EXPECT THIS KIND OF SERVICE FROM

00:17:29.648 --> 00:17:30.716
THEIR COURTS.

00:17:30.783 --> 00:17:33.419

00:17:36.088 --> 00:17:37.356
ONLY TAKE US SO FAR.

00:17:37.423 --> 00:17:39.425
JUSTICE WILL ALWAYS REQUIRE A

00:17:39.491 --> 00:17:41.660
HUMAN TOUCH WE WILL ALWAYS NEED

00:17:41.727 --> 00:17:43.695

EACH YEAR WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY

00:18:03.816 --> 00:18:05.684
SEEKING JUSTICE THESE FOLKS NEED

00:18:05.751 --> 00:18:08.086
HELP TO ACCESS OUR COURT SYSTEM

00:18:08.153 --> 00:18:10.289

YEARS AGO WE DECIDED TO STUDY

00:18:30.809 --> 00:18:32.678
THE NEED FOR LANGUAGE ACCESS IN

00:18:32.744 --> 00:18:35.180
THE COURTS WE ISSUED A REPORT.

00:18:35.247 --> 00:18:36.782
WE MADE RECOMMENDATIONS AND

00:18:36.849 --> 00:18:38.450
RECENTLY WE IMPLEMENTED THOSE

BUT WE ARE COMMITTED TO DOING

00:19:32.604 --> 00:19:33.672
THAT WORK.

00:19:33.739 --> 00:19:36.708
EVERY GENERATION IS RESPONSIBLE

00:19:36.775 --> 00:19:39.811
FOR CREATING DEMOCRACY AND NEW.

00:19:39.878 --> 00:19:41.747
A DEMOCRACY THAT IS RELEVANT AND

00:19:41.813 --> 00:19:43.315
RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF THAT

00:19:43.382 --> 00:19:46.652

00:20:07.439 --> 00:20:09.508
FREDERICK DOUGLASS SAID.

00:20:09.575 --> 00:20:12.010
WHERE JUSTICE IS DENIED?

00:20:12.077 --> 00:20:13.645
WHERE POVERTY IS ENFORCED

00:20:13.712 --> 00:20:15.914
IGNORANCE PREVAILS WHERE ANY ONE

00:20:15.981 --> 00:20:18.116
CLASS IS MADE TO FEEL THAT

00:20:18.183 --> 00:20:19.718
SOCIETY IS AN ORGANIZED

00:20:19.785 --> 00:20:22.521

NEITHER PERSON NOR PROPERTY IS

00:20:25.757 --> 00:20:27.626
SAFE.

00:20:27.693 --> 00:20:29.294
WE IN THE JUDICIARY RECOGNIZE

00:20:29.361 --> 00:20:30.762
THIS AND WE NEED TO WORK ON OUR

00:20:30.829 --> 00:20:32.264
OWN CHALLENGES.

00:20:32.331 --> 00:20:34.032
WE MUST ENSURE THAT INCOME

00:20:34.099 --> 00:20:36.134
INEQUALITY DOESN'T TRANSLATE

00:20:36.201 --> 00:20:46.778
INTO A TWO TIERED JUSTICE SYSTEM.

00:20:46.845 --> 00:20:48.947
WE MUST ENSURE THAT FINES AND

00:20:49.014 --> 00:20:51.750
FEES NO LONGER FALL ON THOSE

00:20:51.817 --> 00:20:53.352
LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD THEM.

00:20:53.418 --> 00:20:55.420
WE MUST ENSURE THAT MINOR

00:20:55.487 --> 00:20:57.356
TRAFFIC OFFENSES DON'T TURN FOR

00:20:57.422 --> 00:21:00.559
DRIVERS INTO POOR CRIMINALS.

00:21:00.626 --> 00:21:03.795
WE MUST ENSURE THAT WE KEEP OUR

00:21:03.862 --> 00:21:06.064
WORKPLACES SAFE AND FREE FROM

00:21:06.131 --> 00:21:08.066
DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT IN

00:21:08.133 --> 00:21:09.101
THAT WE TREAT EACH OTHER.

00:21:09.167 --> 00:21:10.402
AT THE PUBLIC WE SERVE WITH

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:12.204
RESPECT.

00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:13.538
WE NEED OUR CHALLENGES IN THE

00:21:13.605 --> 00:21:15.474

PURSUING RECOMMENDATIONS TO ALL

00:21:21.513 --> 00:21:22.447

00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:30.489
TOGETHER.

00:21:30.555 --> 00:21:33.392
