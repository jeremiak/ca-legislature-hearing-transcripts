RECOGNITION OF SURVIVORS OF SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY WHICH IS A DANGEROUS AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICE WITH NO SCIENTIFIC BASIS AND WHICH CAN CAUSE LIFELONG DAMAGE. I AM HERE AS A MEMBER OF THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY. WHOSE LGBTQ IDENTITY CANNOT AND DOES NOT NEED TO BE CHANGED. AND FINALLY I'M HERE WITH IMMENSE GRATITUDE FOR THE MANY HOURS OF COLLABORATION THAT WENT INTO THIS RESOLUTION. IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE EQUALITY CALIFORNIA CO SPONSORED THE BILL THAT ULTIMATELY PROHIBITED LICENSED. HEALTH PROFESSIONALS FROM PERFORMING SO CALLED CONVERSION THERAPY ON PATIENTS UNDER. EIGHTEEN AND SINCE THEN IT MANY OTHER STATES HAVE ENACTED SIMILAR LAWS. DEMONSTRATING A GROWING NATIONAL CONSENSUS THAT THESE PRACTICES ARE DANGEROUS AND DAMAGING. UNFORTUNATELY THESE PRACTICES ARE STILL CARRIED OUT BY PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED TO CARE FOR THE EMOTIONAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL WELL BEING OF OTHERS. BOTH ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. LGBTQ PEOPLE ATTEMPT SUICIDE OF MORE OFTEN EXPERIENCE DEPRESSION MORE OFTEN AND EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS MORE OFTEN. THAN PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT LGBT Q. AND WHY IS THAT. THAT'S BECAUSE WE ARE TOLD BY PEOPLE AND OUR FAMILIES PEOPLE IN OUR SCHOOLS. ONE TOO MANY OF OUR FAITH COMMUNITIES THAT THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WITH US. AND LET ME BE CLEAR IS NOTHING WRONG WITH ME THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH ANY OF US. THE NATION'S LEADING PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATIONS HAVE REJECTED CONVERSION THERAPY AS UNNECESSARY INEFFECTIVE AND HARMFUL AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO DO THE SAME TODAY THANK YOU.

FAR REACHING AND I MAY BE A BIT NAIVE IN PRESUMING THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN BUT I THINK IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IF WE CHANGE THE TONE HERE IT MAY AFFECT. OTHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY I REALIZE -- HELLO I'M KEVIN MEN WAY I'M SORRY -- THANK YOU -- FOR THE REMINDER -- I'M REALLY GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW FOR AND THOSE WORKING WITH HIM -- FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO DIALOGUE -- HI COME FROM A TRADITION THAT IS A CONSERVATIVE TRADITION IN THE CHRISTIAN CHURCH. AND I APPRECIATE HIS WILLINGNESS TO REMAIN IN DIALOGUE I REALIZE THAT HE AND MANY OTHER PEOPLE HAVE FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES WITH MANY CHRISTIAN CHURCHES -- ESPECIALLY WHAT WE BELIEVE ABOUT -- GOD HUMANITY AND SPECIFICALLY HUMAN SEXUALITY YET IN SPITE OF THOSE DIFFERENCES HE HAS BEEN WILLING TO ENGAGE AND REMAIN ENGAGED AND I ALONG WITH MANY PASTORS ARE GRATEFUL FOR THAT. THE RESOLUTION YOU HAVE IS BECAUSE OF THAT WILLINGNESS. TO REMAIN ENGAGED IN HEALTHY DIALOGUE. AND I'M HOPEFUL THAT THIS WILL MARK A PATTERN OF OPEN HONEST RELATIONAL DIALOGUE AMONG PEOPLE WITH FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES -- YOU HAVE A LETTER THAT I'VE READ SO I DON'T -- THAT I'VE WRITTEN SO YOU DON'T I DON'T NEED TO REHEARSE THAT -- TOGETHER WE'RE COMMITTED TO COMPASSIONATE TREATMENT OF ALL PEOPLE. HONEST GRACIOUS TREATMENT OF ONE ANOTHER REFLECTING CHRIST WELL. I KNOW THAT WE LIVE IN AN INCREASINGLY PLURALISTIC CULTURE. I'M ONE PERSON WHO HAS WALKED ALL MY LIFE -- WITH JESUS CHRIST AS MY FRIEND AND GUIDE AND I'VE LIVED UNDER THE AUTHORITY OF GODS WORD INCLUDING THE BIBLE AND YET I RECOGNIZE. THAT I IN THOSE LIKE ME ARE NOT ALONE. IN THIS STATE OR THIS NATION THERE ARE PEOPLE AND EVEN FELLOW MINISTERS. WHO DO NOT SUPPORT MY BEING HERE WITH EVAN AND I ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE PEOPLE WHO -- DO NOT SUPPORT EVAN IN HIS BEING HERE WITH ME AND WITH THIS PARTICULAR RESOLUTION -- I RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE OTHER MEASURES THAT YOU AND OTHERS WILL DEAL WITH WITH WHICH MANY OF US WILL WILL STRUGGLE AND YET. I WOULD LIKE TO THINK THAT THIS PROCESS THIS SMALL MOMENT. THIS DIALOGUE CAN BE ONE SMALL WAY TO SIGNAL THAT WE MAY HONESTLY ENGAGE. IN HEALTHY DIALOGUE OF INTEGRITY FROM DIFFERENT STARTING POINTS. SO I SEEK WAYS TO FULFILL MY MISSION AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE PROCESS. AS THIS HAS BEEN ONE WAY I AM ABLE HOWEVER IMPERFECTLY. TO DO THAT. THERE ARE SOME AROUND WHO ARE NOT SUPPORTIVE AND YET I PRAY THAT OUR DIALOGUE WILL IN FACT BRING GOOD TO THE PEOPLE AND IN MY PRAYER GLORY TO GOD SO I'M HAPPY TO BE HERE.

PRICING NONE OF BRING IT BACK. TO WE HOPE YOU CAN COME TO THE TABLE THANK YOU HELLO MY NAME IS ELIZABETH WANTING AND I CO LEAD AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE QUIP TO LOVE. AND CHANGED. IT WAS ABOUT THIS TIME LAST YEAR THAT WE ARE HERE TESTIFYING AT THE CAPITOL AND HELLO AGAIN. AND I WISH TO THINK ASSEMBLYMAN LOW AND LGBT CAUCUS FOR PURSUING COMMON GROUND THROUGH THIS RESOLUTION. AS I TESTIFIED BEFORE. I CAME OUT AS A LESBIAN IN MY EARLY TWENTIES AFTER QUESTIONING MY SEXUALITY FOR SEVERAL YEARS. WHEN I WAS NEARLY? FORTY I BEGAN EXPERIENCING A SHIFT IN MY SEXUALITY AND MARRIED A MAN. SOME YEARS AFTER COMING OUT. AS A LESBIAN I ATTENDED A PRESBYTERIAN SEMINARY OPENLY LESBIAN AND BECAME PART OF THE LGBT AFFIRMING CHURCH MOVEMENT. WHEN I CAME OUT I WAS AN ORDAINED ELDER IN MY CHURCH AND I RECALL? THE PAINFUL HUMILIATION I EXPERIENCE WHEN I WAS ASKED TO RESIGN THAT POSITION BECAUSE OF MY ORIENTATION. SO LIKE MANY IN THIS ROOM. I'VE HAD EXPERIENCES OF SIDEWAYS GLANCES A HUMILIATING COMMENTS EVEN THOUGH RIGHT NOW MOST OF YOU CANNOT IMAGINE THAT IN MY LIFE. BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCES IN THOSE OF DEAR FRIENDS I REGARD THIS RESOLUTION WITH GREAT CONCERN. MUCH RESONATES. BECAUSE OF MY PAST I SEEK TO GUIDE CHRISTIANS INTO UNDERSTANDING HONOR AND COMPASSION FOR LGBT PEOPLE. NEVER THE LESS. I TAKE EXCEPTION TO THE BELIEF THAT RELIGION IS CENTRAL TO THE HIGH RATES OF SUICIDE AMONG LGBT YOUTH. FOR ME AND MANY OTHERS FAITH RESCUED US FROM SUICIDE. THE EXPERIENCE OF DISCOVERING YOUR DIFFERENT THAN MOST OTHER PEOPLE IS DRAMATIC AND TROUBLING WHETHER YOU HAVE FAITH OR NOT. HOPELESSNESS CAUSES SUICIDE. AND AS I STATED LAST YEAR TO REMIND THE ASSEMBLY THAT THE LESBIAN EXPERIENCE IS MULTI FACETED. THIS RESOLUTION OVERSIMPLIFIES THE FEMALE EXPERIENCE. NOT ALL WOMEN WHO IDENTIFY AS LESBIAN WILL CLAIM THEY WERE BORN THAT WAY. AND MOST STUDIES ABOUT ORIENTATION HAVE FOCUSED ON MEN. MANY WOMEN WILL EXPERIENCE SEXUAL FLUIDITY EITHER TOWARD OR AWAY LESBIANISM DURING THEIR LIVES AS THE APA CONCEDES. SOME WOMEN ACKNOWLEDGE THE ROLE OF SEXUAL ABUSE BY MEN IN THEIR ORIENTATION. IN THAT CASE COUNSELING OFFERS RESOLUTION AND OFTEN RESTORATION. AND HOW ESSENTIAL THAT IS FOR GIRLS IN ARMY TO CULTURE. I WISH TO SAY AGAIN WOMEN AND GIRLS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO SHAPE THEIR OWN SEXUALITY. IN THE SAME WAY THEY HAVE A RIGHT TO ABORTION. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT BE DICTATING CHOICES ABOUT THEIR BODIES. LIKE YOU I SEEK TO CELEBRATE THE DIGNITY OF ALL PEOPLE I BELIEVE MANY IN THE CHURCH IN THE FACE OF THIS CRISIS. ARE SEEKING WAYS TO COMPASSIONATELY UNDERSTAND AND VALUE THE UNIQUE EXPERIENCES OF LGBT PEOPLE BUT I KNOW BECAUSE OF MY EXPERIENCE. AND HUNDREDS LIKE ME THERE'S MORE THAN ONE WAY TO LIVE WHEN YOU EXPERIENCE LGBT. PLEASE REMEMBER THAT THERE ARE MULTIPLE PASS IT CALIFORNIA MUST KEEP OPEN FOR PEOPLE LIKE US. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MEMBERS PUSHING YOUR TIME GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN SOMEONE LOW -- I'M A PASTOR IN IN REDDING. AND I'VE BEEN MARRIED TO MY WIFE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS WE HAVE FOUR CHILDREN TOGETHER -- BUT THAT IS NOT HOW I STARTED OUT LIFE I A NEVER EXPERIENCE ANY OPPOSITE SEX ATTRACTION UNTIL I WAS AROUND THIRTY THIRTY THREE YEARS OLD AND THEIR I REMEMBER ONE OF THE FIRST. ONE OF MY MY BIGGEST MEMORIES AS A CHILD I WAS PROBABLY NINE OR TEN YEARS OLD I WAS FOLLOWING SOME OTHER BOYS OUT TO A FIELD -- ONE OF THE BOYS OPEN UP A BIT BOX PULLED OUT GAY **** SHOWED IT SHOWED IT TO US. AND NO ONE HAD EVER TALKED TO TALK TO ME ABOUT HOMOSEXUALITY AT THAT POINT THIS IS NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE OR SO. NO ONE TO TALK TO ME ABOUT ****. BUT MY CONSCIENCE WAS DEEPLY VIOLATED IN WHAT I SAW. NOW OTHER PEOPLE MIGHT HAVE A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE THAN WHAT I DID. BUT FOR ME WHAT I WITNESSED WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE. MY CONSCIENCE SAID THIS IS NOT OKAY. AND YOU SHOULDN'T BE LOOKING AT THIS. AND WHAT CONCERNS ME ABOUT THIS RESOLUTION. IS IT SYSTEMATICALLY GOES THROUGH AND AND DISCREDITS ANY VIEWPOINT OTHER THAN A FIRMING OF MOVING IN A HOMOSEXUAL DIRECTION. SO FOR ANYONE THAT'S EXPERIENCE ANY ANY MOMENT THIS IS THE WAY I READ IT ANY MOMENTS OF SAME SEX ATTRACTION OR MAYBE TRANSGENDER FEELINGS ARE LIKE THAT ANYTHING LIKE THAT. YOU MUST DEFERMENT AND GO THAT DIRECTION WELL MY LITTLE CONSCIENCE AS A NINE OR TEN YEAR OLD BOY. DID NOT ALLOW ME TO GO THAT DIRECTION. AND NOR DID MY CONSCIENCE EVER ALLOW ME TO GO THAT DIRECTION. AND THAT'S OUR CONSCIENCES WELL ADULTS HERE WE DON'T DETERMINE OUR CONSCIENCES THAT'S THE THING THAT FIRES OFF. AT WILL. I DON'T DETERMINE WHAT I ACTUALLY BELIEVE DEEP INSIDE. I CAN OBEY MY CONSCIENCE OR NOT. AND SO WHAT SCARY FOR ME IS THAT TWO HUNDRED PLUS YEARS INTO AMERICA'S. DEVELOPMENT OF ITS FREEDOMS THAT WE WOULD BE NOW MOVING TO SUPPORT ONE INITIATIVE ARE ONE VIEW POINT SO STRONGLY. THAT WE WOULD ACTUALLY ERODE A PEOPLE GROUPS. RIGHTS. CONVICTIONS. AND THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE FIND. RESPITE IN ELBA LGBT COMMUNITY. THERE ARE ALSO MANY PEOPLE THAT HAVE TRIED THAT AND IT DID NOT BRING WHAT THEY WERE LOOKING. FOR WE WE ENCOUNTER THOSE PEOPLE ALL THE TIME THIS BOOK THAT WE MADE FOR YOU GUYS AND GIRLS -- INCLUDES FIFTY OF THE STORIES OF FRIENDS LIKE OURS WE KNOW HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE. THAT FOUND FULFILLMENT IN MOVING AWAY FROM THAT. I HAD I HAD A A GIRL THAT CAME UP TO ME AT THE END OF MY MINISTERING. IN A CHURCH SERVICE A FEW MONTHS AGO AND SHE SAID. SHE CAME OUTSHE WAS SHE WAS IT'S HARD TO TELL WHETHER SHE WAS MALE OR FEMALE. AND SHE SHE CRIED AND SHE SAID. SHE SAID FOR ANYONE TO REFER TO ME AS A HE OR A SHE FEELS LIKE I'M BEING STABBED WITH KNIVES. AND SHE CRIED AND I PRAYED FOR HER. USING NOPE NO GENDER PRONOUNS. BUT WHAT SHE WAS ASKING FOR ME WAS NOT THAT I USE THE RIGHT PRONOUNS. WHAT SHE WAS SAYING IS CAN YOU HELP ME? BECAUSE SHE WASN'T FEELING OKAY WITH HERSELF. NO MATTER HOW SOMEONE REFERRED TO HER SHE NEED HELP. SHE NEEDED THE CHURCH SHE NEED PROFESSIONAL HELP [inaudible] IN. SO A SOMEONE -- I AM I'M ASKING YOU. YOU MAY HAVE THE VOTES TO PASS THIS BUT I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE THE RIGHT. TO PRESUPPOSE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCES OR TO TELL THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO BELIEVE I TOTALLY SUPPORT. YOUR RIGHT AND EVERYONE YOU REPRESENT TO EXPERIENCE WHATEVER IN LIFE THAT YOU'D LIKE TO I HAVE NO INTENTION TO TAKE THAT AWAY. I JUST AM ASKING THAT MY RIGHT TO MY PEOPLE GROUP WOULD ALSO BE RESPECTED. SO I ASKED FOR A NO VOTE ON THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU THANK YOU AND I'LL ASK WITNESSES TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE NOT INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS PLEASE THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR DIALOGUE WITH INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS. OR ANY OTHER OPPOSITION. AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE A GREAT BURKE CALIFORNIA FAMILY COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. CARMEN FOUGHT ON BEHALF OF THE QUICK TO LOVE I OPPOSE. KRISTER SAM'S ON BEHALF OF EQUIPPED TO LOVE AND I OPPOSE. PASTOR MIKE ROGERS I OPPOSE. BASED ON GOD'S WORD STILL. HI A EVAN MAINTAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING LATE A MOCKS ACTUALLY ON THE SUPPORT SIDE AND WITH VOICES FOR PROGRESS WERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS RESOLUTION AND THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. TIONS COMMON. MISTER GALLAGHER. NONE SO I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR WE'VE HAD SOME. GOOD DISCUSSIONS OF LAST YEAR -- WITH HIS LEGISLATION AND AND I HAVE GIVEN HIM CREDIT AND I CONTINUE TO GIVE HIM CREDIT. FOR HE DID HAVE THE VOTES HE COULD HAVE PUSHED THROUGH THAT BILL LAST YEAR -- AND YOU KNOW BUT I THINK SAW THE VALUE IN HAVING DIALOGUE AND HAVE A DISCUSSION ESPECIALLY WITH THE FAITH COMMUNITY THAT. THE OTHER IS IMPACTED BY THIS AND SO I YOU KNOW I WANT. TO AGAIN GIVE THE AUTHOR CREDIT FOR THAT YOU KNOW THIS YEAR HE AND I HAVE NOT HAD AN OPPORTUNITY REALLY TALK MUCH ABOUT THIS NOT NOT TO ANY BODIES FAULTS BUT JUST. WERE ALL BUSY WITH DIFFERENT -- ISSUES -- SO THIS IS KIND OF OUR THE FIRST TIME WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DISCUSS THIS RESOLUTION -- YOU KNOW I THINK. I THINK FOR ME LIKE I WANT TO CONTINUE THIS DIALOGUE I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT AS MR MANILA BROUGHT UP TO THE THAT THE DIALOGUE DOES CONTINUE. I THINK SOME OF THE THE CONCERNS THAT I HAVE WITH THE RESOLUTION AS IT IS RIGHT NOW IS IT IT SEEMS. TO ME TO LUMP. ALL PRACTICES INTO A DAMAGING CONVERSION THERAPY -- YELLOW. BAND IF YOU WILL -- AND I DON'T THINK THAT ALL PRACTICES ARE YOU KNOW AND I THINK THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE PRACTICES OF FAITH AND I THINK YOU I THINK YOU SEE THAT -- TOO THAT THE THAT THERE ARE LEGITIMATE PRACTICES OF FAITH -- THAT ARE DONE IN A LOVING AND COMPASSIONATE -- WAY -- AND YOU KNOW WE DO NEED TO RESPECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AND I DON'T SEE. YOU KNOW A FIRM STATEMENT OF THAT IN THIS RESOLUTION THAT HEY PEOPLE ARE YOU KNOW FREE TO PRACTICE THEIR FAITH AS THEY BELIEVE AND AND THAT GOES TO PEOPLE FROM ALL DIFFERENT WALKS OF OF LIFE -- I THINK THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE IS JUST -- ANY TIME THAT WE AS A GOVERNMENT ARE SORT OF TELLING. FAITH LEADERS ARE TELLING A CHURCH. YOU KNOW HOW THEY SHOULD OPERATOR HOW THEY SHOULD GO ABOUT PRACTICING THEIR FAITH. YOU KNOW WE IN THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE OBVIOUSLY OUT TO BE PRETTY CONCERNED. ABOUT PROTECTING THE FIRST AMENDMENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION SHOULD NOT BE ABRIDGED -- AND EVEN A EVEN IF EVEN IN A BUT NINE WAY AS THIS I THINK THIS. WE CAN ALL AGREE ON TREATING PEOPLE EQUITABLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE ARE TREATED ACTED WITH THE PEOPLE ARE FIRMS. THAT PEOPLE ARE UP LIFTED -- THAT PEOPLE APPROACH THINGS FROM OF A PLACE OF LOVE AND COMPASSION -- EVEN THOUGH I MIGHT AGREE ABOUT THAT I THINK IT'S TROUBLING WHEN WE START. WE AT LEAST HAVE. TO I THINK SHOULD BE CONCERNED IMPOSSIBLE BUT WHEN WE AS A GOVERNMENT BODY ARE STARTING. TO MAKE ADMONITIONS TO CHURCHES AND RELIGIOUS AND AND AND THE PASTORS CLERICS. RELIGIOUS LEADERS IF YOU WILL -- BECAUSE I THINK WE HAVE THAT IS A SLIPPERY SLOPE LIKE HOW FAR DO WE TAKE THAT TO WE START AS A GOVERNMENT START. ADMONISH TEEN OR TELLING IN FAITH LEADERS WHAT TO DO OR HOW THEY SHOULD PRACTICE THEIR FAITH -- AND I THINK YOU YOU KNOW YOU'VE HEARD FROM PEOPLE THAT HAD IF THEY'VE HAD A DIFFERENT EXPERIENCE -- AND I THINK THAT'S VERY IT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN YEAR -- YOUR MANTRA THAT HEY YOU WANNA RESPECT EVERYBODY'S DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES AND THAT WE DO LIVE IN A PLURALISTIC SOCIETY AND SO THEREFORE WE DO ALSO NEED TO RESPECT. THAT PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES WITH THIS ISSUE -- AND AND RESPECT PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO PRACTICE THEIR FAITH -- YOU KNOW AS THEY AS THEY DECIDE TO DO YOU KNOW AND IN THEIR CONGREGATIONS WITH THEIR FAITH COMMUNITY -- SO. YEAH I'D LIKE TO IF WE COULD WORK ON SOME OF THE LANGUAGE TO THAT TO THAT EXTENT -- YOU KNOW I DON'T SEE THAT IN THE RESOLUTION RIGHT NOW BUT YOU KNOW. FOR ME THAT'S THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS [inaudible] THE STRESS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. AT LAST YEAR WILL END OF THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED ON REGARDING CONVERSION THERAPY. I APPLAUDED THE AUTHOR FOR GOING TO SO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE WERE MANY IN OUR FAITH COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE QUESTIONS. pWILLINGNESS. NOT ONLY TO GO BUT TO ACTUALLY GO AND TO MEET WITH THE STATE LEADERS. WHO WERE COMPLETELY OPPOSED? YOU'RE RIGHT THE AUTHOR HAD THE VOTES. AND THE AUTHOR DECIDED TO CONTINUE THAT DIALOGUE MUCH TO HIS CREDIT. I THINK THAT IT IF IT PASTOR YOUR YOUR COMMENTS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT SAYING THIS IS ALAW THAT'S GOING TO FORCE ANYBODY TO DO ANYTHING. THIS IS A RESOLUTION. FOR THOSE IN IN THE IN THE FAITH BASED COMMUNITY BECAUSE YES THEY ARE THE CAUSE OF THE SUICIDE. BUT MANY PEOPLE DO SEEK THE THE ATTENTION AND THE AFFIRMATION FROM THE VERY CHURCHES WHERE THEY WERE RAISED. IT IS AN IMPORTANT STEP. I THINK THAT -- WITH THOSE A COMMENT ABOUT A MORAL CALL. TO THE PEOPLE TO DIALOGUE AND TREAT EACH OTHER TREAT EACH PERSON WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY. THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS ALL ABOUT. IS AFFIRMING THAT WE AS CALIFORNIANS WANT EVERYONE INCLUDING OUR FAITH BASED COMMUNITY AND INCLUDING A VERY VERY SPECIFICALLY IN THIS RESOLUTION WE WANT ALL CALIFORNIANS TO TREAT EACH OTHER WITH RESPECT. AND DIGNITY. WETALKED ABOUT OF FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES. I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THAT THE PERSISTENCE IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT HERE. BECAUSE THIS THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT AN ISSUE TO JUST SAY OKAY I'M GOING TO CONTINUE DIALOGUING TILL I'M OUT OF OFFICE. THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT TO TOO MANY PEOPLE IT AFFECTS TOO MANY PEOPLE AND IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO WILL TALK ABOUT THIS HEALTHY DIALOGUE WITH DIGNITY AND RESPECT. THE THE THE ONE THING THAT WE HEAR ABOUT OFTEN IS LOVE IS LOVE. AND IF LOVE IS LOVE THEN THIS IS THE RESOLUTION WE DO NEED TO PASS SO I I AM AS A ONE ONE OF MANY OF YOUR CO AUTHORS. I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN. THANK YOU. AND YOU KNOW JUST SORT GOING THROUGH THIS IN REVIEWING THIS ACTUAL IS GOING TO SPEAK BUT I WANT. TO SORT OF ADD MY VOICE TO THIS AND TALK ABOUT WITH THIS THIS ACTUALLY DOES -- THE TO THE IF YOU ACTUALLY READ. THE THE DOCUMENT ITSELF IT SAYS IT RESOLVES THE RESOLUTION CALLS UPON ALL CALIFORNIANS TO EMBRACE THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL BENEFITS OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY ACCEPTANCE. GOOD I MEAN I THINK THAT. CRAP IN I'M NOT A RELIGIOUS EXPERTS -- BUT THAT PRETTY MUCH CROSSES ALL RELIGIONS -- TEACHINGS AND THEN SECONDLY CALLS UPON RELIGIOUS LEADERS TO COUNTS ON LGBT Q. MATTERS FROM A PLACE OF LOVE COMPASSION AND KNOWLEDGE OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL ANOTHER HARMS OF CONVERSION THERAPY. AGAIN -- PRETTY SIMPLE NOT. TAKING THAT NOT BANNING SOMETHING IN NOT HAVING GOVERNMENT. PUT ITS THE IN -- IN A PLACE MAYBE THAT IT SHOULDN'T AND FINALLY CALLS UPON ALL PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS IN CALIFORNIA IN ADDRESSING THE STIGMA OFTEN ASSOCIATE WITH PERSONS WHO IDENTIFIES LGBT Q.. TO MODEL EQUITABLE TREATMENT OF ALL PEOPLE AGAIN A PRETTY SIMPLE I THINK BASIC. KIND -- COMING FROM A KIND LOVING PLACE THAT WROTE THAT RELIGION COMES FROM -- TO SO. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THIS IS -- CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES OF THE LEGISLATURE THESE CONSISTENT WITH THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA -- I'M CERTAINLY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY -- AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING IT I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S IMPORTANT -- TO REFLECT THAT. WHERE PEOPLE COME FROM ON THIS SHOULD BE COMING FROM A PLACE OF COMPASSION SHOULD BE COMING FROM A PLACE OF LOVE AND RESPECT TO WHOEVER'S COMING BEFORE -- WE'RE ALL EQUAL CITIZENS IN THE STATE. I'M REGARDLESS OF SEXUAL ORIENTATION -- AND SO I THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT I'M GLAD THAT YOU BROUGHT THIS AND I THINK THAT. IF YOU LOOK AT THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE NOT WHAT MAY MAY BE. OTHER INTERPRETATIONS OF IT SOMEHOW THAT I'VE GOTTEN OUT IN THE MEDIA OR OTHERWISE IF YOU LOOK AT WHAT THIS SAYS IT ESSENTIALLY SAYS TREAT PEOPLE WITH COMPASSION. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS. IF YOU SOME THE SEPT TREAT PEOPLE WITH COMPASSION THAT'S SOMETHING -- I THINK THAT THIS LEGISLATURE SHOULD STRONGLY STAND FOR SO VERY HAPPY SUPPORT THIS TODAY. THANK YOU THIS FEATURE NORRIS. I JUST WANTED TO ADDRESSING ONE OF THE COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE -- IN YOUR REMARKS. YOU SAID THAT THAT. NONE OF US IS THAT WE HAVE NO RIGHT TO PRESUPPOSE PEOPLE'S CONSCIENCE. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A SENTIMENT THAT WE WERE ALL WHOLE HEARTEDLY AGREE WITH AND I THINK THAT IS VERY MUCH. WHAT THIS RESOLUTION IS SAYING? SO I'VE GOT I'VE GOT TWO CHILDREN THEY ARE TEN AND TWELVE YEARS OLD. WHAT EVER THEIR PATH WHATEVER THEIR AFFILIATION? YEAH. HOWEVER THEY GO THROUGH IN OF THEIR IN THEIR PATH TO ADULTHOOD. I DON'T WANT. ANYONE OF FAITH LEADER. COMMUNITY LATER I DON'T ANYONE. JUDGING NOT. OR RELATING TO THAT AS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED OR SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CONVERTED. SO AS A MOTHER I AM VERY VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION AND AS A LEGISLATOR I'M VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU NO ONE ELSE. RIGHT SEEING NONE MISTER LOOMING CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF FOR THAT FOR THE COMMENTS AS WELL -- FIRST OUT ONE TWO I THANK OF KEVIN I KNOW OF FOR HIS ENGAGEMENT ON THIS ISSUE WHAT YOU HAVE BEFORE US HERE IT WAS IS NOT. THAT THE PRODUCT YOU HAVE BEFORE YOU IS NOT. A DOES NOT COME EASILY -- THERE WERE MANY OF CONVERSATIONS A MANY MANY CONVERSE VERY DIFFICULT CONVERSATIONS TO WHICH FRANKLY THEY WERE. TIME TO WHICH I THOUGHT THIS COULD BE POSSIBLE THAT WE WOULD RESPECTIVELY WALK WALK AWAY. A BECAUSE THE DIVIDE WITH TWO GREAT -- BUT AS A RESULT OF THE WORK IN THE CONVERSATIONS AND OF THE SHARED VALUES -- BE REALIZE THAT WE HAVE MUCH MORE IN COMMON THAN WE HAVE THAT OF DIFFERENCES. AND AGAIN IF I CAN JUST READ. THE OP ED THAT KEVIN READ AND AGAIN KEVIN'S POSITION IS FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICALS AND IS A FORMER BISHOP OF THE FREE METHODIST CHURCH. AND HE STATED THAT REPAIRED OF THERAPY IS WITHOUT EVIDENCE TO IS EFFICACY AND IT IN CONSISTENT WITH CHRISTIAN LIVING. WE SUPPORT THIS OPPOSITION TO THIS PRACTICE BECAUSE THAT HARMS PEOPLE. THIS IS CONTRARY TO THE NATURE OF THE CHRISTIAN MESSAGE WHICH WHILE CALLING FOR THE CHANGE OF ALL PEOPLE TO BE AUDITED ORIENTED TOWARD CHRIST. EVEN AT GREAT SACRIFICE NEED THE FAVORS NOR SUPPORTS ANY PRACTICE THAT CAUSES HARM. AGAIN I THINK TO THE POINT THAT OUR COLLEAGUES MADE THE NOTION OF CONVERSION THERAPY IS ANTITHETICAL TO MY VERY EXISTENCE MY VERY BEING. SITTING HERE -- THAT WE SHOULD BE LOVED AND CELEBRATED AND THAT THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY WRONG THAT SOMETHING SHOULD BE CHANGED THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH. INDIVIDUALS LIKE MYSELF -- MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY. AND AGAIN WHAT YOU HAVE HERE IS. AN EFFORT A TRANSFORMATIVE EFFORT I BELIEVE TO SAYING THAT. MEMBERS OF THE RELIGIOUS COMMUNITY AND MEMBERS OF RELIGIOUS FAITH CAN HOLD HANDS. CAN HOLD HANDS WITH MEMBERS OF THE LGBT COMMUNITY -- THAT WE CAN GET AWAY FROM WHAT WE SEE AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL AND THAT OF DIVIDE PUT OF COMMONALITY -- AND SO THIS IS THE ESSENCE OF LOVE.

FIVE EIGHTEEN DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE RATHER TO NOTE THAT FIVE EIGHTEEN IS FINE. SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTEEN THEM SOMEBODY IS [inaudible] SUPPORT. THIS IS A SIMPLY CLARIFIES EXISTING LAW ON THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THAT THE COURT SHALL AWARD COURT COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY FEES. TO THE REQUESTER SHOULD THE REQUEST TO PREVAIL UNFORTUNATELY IS THE STAFF ANALYSIS POINTS OUT A FEW PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE FOUND THE WAY TO CIRCUMVENT -- THIS LAW BY USING -- NINE NINETY EIGHT OFFERS A TYPE A SETTLEMENT OFFER THAT CAN PREVENT THE RELEASE. OF THIS CLOSABLE DOCUMENTS AND SHIFT ALL THE POST OFFER COST ONTO THE RECORD YOUR QUAESTORS. LET ME BE CLEAR THAT SENATE BILL FIVE EIGHTEEN WOULD NOT PREVENT REQUESTERS AND PUBLIC AGENCIES FROM OFFERING SETTLEMENTS OPPOSITION HAS. CONCERNS ABOUT THE SERIAL LITIGANTS INCREASING IF. SB FIVE EIGHTEEN PASSES HOWEVER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT ALREADY AWARDS ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS. OF PUBLIC AGENCIES FOR CLEARLY FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS BEYOND THIS CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE ONLY ONLY HAVE STATES THAT HAS A FICTITIOUS LITIGANTS LAW WHICH IN THE AGAIN IS ANOTHER KERR. THE LAW HAS EXPLICIT -- PROCESSES AND CONSEQUENCES FOR BEING A REPEAT FILER PURSUING ON THESE ON MERITORIOUS CLAIMS. BIG TEACHES LITIGANTS I CAN BE HELD A CONTEMPT OF COURT AND EVEN THESE SANCTION FOR BAD FAITH. CLAIMS THIS BILL. FIVE EIGHTEEN INSURES THAT OUR PUBLIC RECORDS ACT IS BEING USED AS IT WAS INTENDED AS A WAY FOR CALIFORNIANS TO GET INFORMATION ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT FEARS OF BEING BURDENED BY THE GOVERNMENT COSTS IN. A GYM. THE WORD IS HERE FROM THE ADS CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JIMMY WHAT WITH A CALIFORNIA NEWS PUBLISHERS ASSOCIATION [inaudible] THE ENFORCEMENT A PROVISION IN THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THAT SHIFT FEES FROM. A DEFENDANT AGENCIES TO PLAINTIFFS IS THE ONLY MECHANISM BY WHICH A REQUEST OR HAS TO GET INFORMATION FROM AN AGENCY. THAT OTHERWISE WOULD STONE WALL OR IGNORE THE OF REQUESTERS I REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. AND OFTEN TIMES AGENCIES HAVE OR INCENTIVIZE TO DO THAT IF THEY DON'T WANT TO SING INFORMATION TO BE DISCLOSED -- FOR MY FOLKS ESPECIALLY SINCE THEY LIKE TO GET INFORMATION IN A TIMELY MANNER WHEN THINGS ARE BREAKING. AND IT'S EWS WORTHY AN AGENCY CAN DELAY OF IN AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO PREVENT STORIES FROM BEING -- WRITTEN -- THE WAY THAT THE SETTLEMENT OFFERS IN NINE NINE EIGHT OPERATE THERE THERE WERE INTENDED TO PROVIDE A REMEDY FOR DISPUTES INVOLVING MONEY. AND NOT EQUITABLE REMEDIES OR EQUITABLE DAMAGES. A REQUEST -- WILL NEVER MAKE A NINE NINE EIGHT MOTION BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT INTERESTED IN OBTAINING MONEY OR THERE'S THERE'S NO MONEY IN DISPUTE VERY INTERESTED IN GETTING THE RECORDS. AND AN AGENCY WILL USE A NINE NINE EIGHT MOTION AS A COERCIVE TOOL IN ORDER TO SCARE A REQUEST INTO GIVING UP INFORMATION THEY MIGHT OTHERWISE BE ENTITLED TO UNDER THE LAW -- BUT NONE THE LATCH ARE AFRAID THAT THEY MAY NOT RECOVER ALL OF THE ATTORNEYS FEES AT THE INQUIRER AS A RESULT OF HAVING TO COME FORWARD. AND LITIGATE OF A LEGITIMATE DISPUTE OVER WHETHER THE AGENCY PROPERLY WITHHELD RECORDS -- THIS IS AS PROPOSED -- TO BE AMENDED -- IT'S IT'S A TERRIFIC TOOL -- OR EXEMPTION TO A TOOL THAT WAS NOT OTHERWISE -- INTENDED TO APPLY TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. MOREOVER IT DOESN'T REMOVE ANY OTHER SETTLEMENT OPTIONS FROM THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN AN AGENCY IN A REQUEST -- SIXTY TWO FIFTY THREE POINT ONE OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE REQUIRES OF THE REQUEST DURING THE AGENCY TO MEET AND CONFER EVEN BEFORE LITIGATION IS FILED TO TRY TO RESOLVE OR NARROW POTENTIAL DISPUTES ABOUT THE RECORDS THAT ARE BEING. REQUESTED ARE AND OF COURSE IF LITIGATION IS FILED OF OTHER TYPES OF SETTLEMENTS CAN OCCUR WHERE AN AGENCY CAN -- PREPARE A RESPONSE AND ROLL IT OUT. AS INSTEAD OF WAITING UNTIL ALL THE RECORDS ARE GATHERED BEFORE -- IT IS -- RESPONDED -- TO FOR ALL THESE REASONS. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL ARE GREAT ANALYSIS BY YOUR STAFF VERY THOROUGH -- WE ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU AND SENATOR THERE ARE AMENDMENTS YEAH WE'RE TAKING THOSE MOMENTS RIGHT ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU APOLOGIZE. YEAH. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS MERRY GO USUALLY HARM BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PLUMMET LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. STEVE GORMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY STRONG SUPPORT. Q. ANYONE ELSE AND SUPPORTS. SEEING NONE IS THERE OPPOSITION YEAH. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE DEALING GIVENS WITH THE CALIFORNIA SPECIAL DISTRICTS ASSOCIATION -- IN OPPOSITION TO SB -- FIVE EIGHTEEN WANTED TO SPEAK TO A COUPLE OF THE STATEMENTS. MADE BY THE SUPPORTERS -- ONE WAS THAT THE ONLY INCENTIVE THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE TO RELEASING -- PUBLIC DOCUMENTS IS -- THREAT OF A LAWSUIT. ARGUE THAT -- THEY WANTS TO PROVIDE THAT IN MOST CASES WANT TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC. AS A PUBLIC SERVICE. AND IN RESPONSE TO THE C. P. R. A LAW -- WHETHER THERE WAS A THREAT OF LITIGATION OR NOT -- ADDITIONALLY THERE IT SAYS THAT. THERE WAS NO INCENTIVE -- FOR LAWSUITS FOR A REQUEST -- OTHER THAN TO RECEIVE DOCUMENTS -- THERE IS AN INCENTIVE -- FOR LESS THAN SPEAKER LESS SCRUPULOUS ATTORNEYS WHO ARE JUST LOOK LOOKING TO SEEK ATTORNEY'S FEES FROM PUBLIC AGENCIES. I WOULD SAY THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF REQUEST ARE NOT THOSE TYPES OF REQUESTED THEY ARE LEGITIMATE PUBLIC -- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC SEEKING -- PUBLIC DOCUMENTS. THERE IS NOT A REQUIREMENT TO MEET AND CONFER -- ONE OF THE THE ISSUES WITH CPR A LAWSUIT IS THAT ONCE A REQUEST HER HAS MADE A REQUEST OF A PUBLIC AGENCY FOR FOR DOCUMENTS AND AS SOON AS THEY RECEIVED. A DENIAL OF THOSE RECORDS THEY CAN SUE IMMEDIATELY THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT FOR THE MEMBER OF THE PUBLIC TO WORK WITH THE PUBLIC AGENCY TO NARROW THEIR REQUEST. THERE IS HOWEVER A REQUIREMENT THE PUBLIC AGENCY TRY TO WORK WITH THE REQUEST OR TO NARROW THAT THOSE REQUESTS SO -- NOW TO IT'S A SECTION NINE EIGHT OFFERED A OFFERS ARE VERY RARELY USED AND CPR A CASES -- HOW ARE THEY ARE HELPFUL TOOL IN PREVENTING SERIAL THAT AGAINST FROM EXTORTING PUBLIC AGENCIES -- IN RECENT YEARS ARE DISTRICTS HAVE SEEN AN ENORMOUS INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF CPR A REQUEST -- COMING FROM ALL OVER THE NATION AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF RECORDS THAT ARE BEING SOUGHT IN EACH REQUEST. SOMETIMES YOU CAN MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND RECORDS -- AND MANY RECALL REQUEST THE THE THE IN MANY CASES THE REQUESTS ARE COMING FROM THE SAME -- INDIVIDUAL OR THE SAME GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE A VENDETTA AGAINST A PUBLIC AGENCY AND ARE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES. TO SUE THE AGENCY. IN THOSE CASES A A FOR A CPR A CASE CAN ONLY BE FOUND BE FRIVOLOUS IF IT IS A COMPLETELY WITHOUT MERIT WHICH IS. ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO ACHIEVE AND THAT ONCE THE RECORD HAS BEEN DENIED THERE IS WITH MERIT FOR SOMEBODY TO SEEK THE RECORD -- THROUGH LAWSUIT -- UNDER CURRENT LAW THE THE RECORDS REQUEST THROUGH THE THE BELIEVES THE PUBLIC AGENCIES IMPROPERLY WITHHELD RECORD. THEY MAY SUE IMMEDIATELY AGAIN THERE IS NO MEET AND CONFER -- REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY SHOULD REQUEST TO PREVAIL IN COURT BY HAVING EVEN A SINGLE RECORD RELEASED -- THAT THEY HAD PREVIOUSLY -- THAT A PREVIOUSLY BEEN WITHHELD -- THE C. P. R. A. MANDATES THAT THE COURT AWARD COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY'S FEES TO THE PLAINTIFFS OFFERS A COMPROMISE MADE UNDER SECTION. NINE NINE EIGHT ARE INTENDED TO ENCOURAGE LITIGANTS TO SETTLE THEIR DISPUTE AN AMICABLE AND REASONABLE FASHION TO AVOID EXCESSIVE LITIGATION COSTS. ELIMINATING THIS LITIGATION PRACTICE PRACTICE WOULD DISCOURAGE PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS. BUT SEE PERRY CASES FROM SETTLING BECAUSE THEY WOULD FACE NO CONSEQUENCEFOR REJECTING A REASONABLE AND FAIR SECTION NINE NINE NATO OFFER BUT POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TO GAIN IN FEES. PAID WITH TAXPAYER DOLLARS BY PROCEEDING WITH COSTLY LITIGATION PROCESS EVEN IF ATTORNEY ATTORNEYS CLIENT RECEIVES NO ADDITIONAL BENEFIT. OTHER THAN WHAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OFFERED IN THE SETTLEMENT -- SB FIVE EIGHTEEN CREATES A LOPSIDED BENEFIT TO PLAINTIFF ATTORNEYS. OVER A PUBLIC AGENCIES THAT ENCOURAGE THAT ENCOURAGES COSTLY LITIGATION WHEN A SIMPLE CENTER ELEMENT AGREEMENT WRAP UP PLEASE FOR THESE REASONS WE OPPOSED SB FIVE EIGHTEEN THANK YOU. THANK YOU. MORE YEAH JASON BROWN OF THE HALF THE CALIFORNIA DOWNTOWN ASSOCIATION -- MY ASSOCIATION REPRESENTS THE BUSINESS IMPROVEMENT DISTRICTS OF CALIFORNIA -- THEY DON'T TO ISSUE BUILDING PERMITS THEY DON'T TO HIRE LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS A SIMPLY. ARE THERE TO ENHANCE AND PROMOTE THE DOWNTOWN DISTRICT WHICH THEY SERVE. YET ARE SUBJECT TO THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND COMPLY WITH THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE WE HAVE SEEN AND OUR MEMBERSHIP IS THE ONSLAUGHT OF PUBLIC RECORDS REQUESTS FOR OUR DISTRICTS AND THE CHALLENGES. TO TIMELY RESPOND TO THOSE REQUESTS AND WE'VE SEEN INCREASING LITIGATION -- BY -- TYPICALLY A HANDFUL OF FOLKS THAT THAT THAT HAVE -- THAT ARE USING THE ACT -- TO FURTHER LITIGATE AND WE ARE JUST SIMPLY LOOKING FOR TOOLS -- TO BE MAINTAINED SO WE CAN AT SETTLE ANY DISPUTES. FOR THE YEAR ON ARE ARE NOT WORTHY -- OUTSIDE OF COURT BECAUSE EVERY DOT EVERY TIME WE'RE SPENDING A DOLLAR -- DEFENDING A SUIT IN COURT IS ONE LESS DOLLAR SPENT IN OUR DISTRICTS AND SO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOSING A TOOL. TO REDUCE LITIGATION. AND TO REDUCE THE LEAKAGE OF COSTS THAT TO THE COURT SYSTEM RATHER THAN IMPROVING THE DISTRICTS IN WHICH WE SERVICE AND STUFF THAT REASON WE OPPOSE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE I AM WORKING WITH THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS ALSO IN OPPOSITION. IT'S JUST. A JUST SO THAT I UNDERSTAND THE THE THE APPLICATION OF THIS BILL SO THE BILL IS ACTUALLY SEEKS TO DO AWAY WITH NINE NINETY NINE NINE EIGHT TARA -- SEGMENT OFFERS CORRECT. IN PUBLIC RECORDS ACT CORRECT NOT IN THE IN THIS CONTEXT CORRECT. NOW -- I THINK I HEARD WHAT I HEARD EARLIER WAS THAT -- THERE'S ALREADY EXISTING MECHANISMS TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST. TO AWE ABUSE OR OR FIXATION IS -- LITIGATION UP CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THE ALLEGED -- THE YES MEAN THE DO YOU THINK I THINK THERE'S A FEW STATES IN CAL IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THE BIG TEACHES LITIGANTS CAN BE HELD IN CONTEMPT OF COURT -- WITH -- BY DAY THEY CAN BE SANCTIONED FOR HAVING THEIR BAD CLAIMS ARE BAD FAITH CLAIMS THEY CAN BE -- THEY CAN BE AWARDED ARE THAT THE DEFENDANT CAN BE AWARDED -- ATTORNEY FEES AND COSTS IF THEY'RE CLEARLY FRIVOLOUS CLAIMS THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE -- ELEMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE THAT ARE NOT AVAILABLE IN OTHER STATES SO TO THE OPPONENTS WOODEN WINDOWS SO MEASURES BE SUFFICIENT TO SAFEGUARD AGAINST. ANY POTENTIAL ABUSE. FOR CLEARLY FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS YES BUT UNFORTUNATELY THEY HAVE WHAT IT'S VERY VERY DIFFICULT FOR PUBLIC AGENCY TO HAVE A LAWSUIT TURNOUT BECAUSE IT'S FRIVOLOUS BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS THEY'RE TRYING TO SEEK A RECORD. AND THE RECORD WAS DENIED AND SO IT IS SENT INHERENTLY IT IF SOMEBODY FILING A SUIT SEEKING A RECORD -- IT WOULD NOT BE WITHOUT BE COMPLETELY WITHOUT MERIT WHICH IS THE STAT THE STANDARD FOR TO BE FRIVOLOUS. IT WOULD HELP IN CASES WHERE -- AN AGENCY -- PROVIDED DOCUMENTS. AFTER A CERTAIN TIME PERIOD THAT THE AN EXAMPLE WAS A A SUIT WAS FILED BY A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY. AGAINST A PUBLIC AGENCY THAT THE THAT IT DENIED CERTAIN RECORDS -- PRIOR. ONCE NOTIFIED THAT SUIT WAS COMING THE AGENCY WAS ABLE TO IDENTIFY ADDITIONAL RECORDS ANSWERED AND SUPPLY THOSE RECORDS BACK IN THIS IS I BELIEVE IN THE ANALYSIS. SUPPLY THOSE RECORDS BACK TO THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY THEY CONTINUED ON WITH THEIR SUIT AND WERE SEEKING ATTORNEY'S FEES THAT THE COURT FOUND. THE PUBLICATION SEE ACTED WOULD PROBABLY IN AND GAVE THAT RECORD AS SOON AS POSSIBLE PRIOR TO THE THE SUIT AND SO IN THAT CASE THE SUIT WAS FRIVOLOUS HOWEVER IN THE VAST MAJORITY. OF THESE CASES IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE TO BE CONSIDERED FROM HIS BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEKING A RECORD THAT WAS DENIED. THANK YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS KILEY. BUT JUST SO IT CAN UNDERSTAND HOW THIS WORKS HERE I MEAN THAT IN NINE EIGHT OFFERS ARE USUALLY DONE WHEN OFFER OF OF MONEY RIGHT AND THEN JUDGING BY WHETHER THE FINAL VERDICT AS HERS WAS ALTERNATELY RECEIVED IS LESS OR MORE THAN THAT. AND SO AS FOR THE AUTHOR DO YOU THINK THAT UNDER EXISTING LAW AND NINE NINE EIGHT EVEN. DOES APPLY TO THESE SORT OF SITUATIONS OR IS THAT AN AREA OF AMBIGUITY WELL THERE'S FOUR CASES MISTER CHAIR THERE'S FOUR CASES THAT HAVE COME BEFORE US THE THAT THAT -- PUBLIC AGENCIES HAVE MADE NINE NINE OFFERS JUST FOR REQUEST FOR PUBLIC PUBLIC RECORDS HUNDRED RESIDENTS TO SIT AND THERE'S PRESENT THERE'S A CASE THAT'S CITED IN THE ANALYSIS I THANK YOU SO SO. UNFORTUNATELY YES IT'S IT'S MOST ATTORNEYS I THINK THAT THAT. NINE NINETY EIGHT OFFER SHOULD BE IN A PUBLIC RECORDS ARENA BUT IT IS AND SO YOU JUST COMPARE I MEAN WITH -- I MONEY OFF YOUR LIKE ALRIGHT WE OFFERED TEN THOUSAND YOU GOT -- FIVE THOUSAND IT WHAT YOU YOU SAID WE OFFERED THIS MANY DOCUMENTS AND YOU GOT THAT MANY DOCUMENTS AND THAT'S HOW YOU COMPARE WE KNOW THEY CAN -- THROUGH CHAIR THEY COULD THEY PUT A DOLLAR OFFER IN THERE ALSO MEAN WHICH I REMEMBER THE FEES I TO COVER THE FEES TO THAT YOU'RE COMPARING RIGHT IS WHAT WAS OFFERED IN TERMS OF THE ATTORNEY FEES. AND IT'S THE CHILLING EFFECT WHICH YOU KNOW TO BE CLEAR. MR. AS A MEMBER AND AND CHAIR IS THAT THIS DOESN'T STOP ANY SETTLEMENT FOR ANY LAWSUIT THAT'S GOING OUT THOSE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING ON IT'S JUST WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE NINE NINE EIGHT OFFER. pPORTION OF IT DOES NOT APPLY. I THERE'S OTHER THINGS IN LITIGATION RIDE. RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU. YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS ALL RIGHT SEE NONE CENTER YOU MAY CLOSE I ASSN AYE UNDERAGE AND I VOTE THANK YOU WE STILL NEED A MOTION. THERE'S A MOTION. I WILL SECOND THAT MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER CHOW. CHOW I CHU. CHU AYE GABRIEL HOLDEN. AND I KALRA [inaudible] KILEY.

SEVEN OH SEVEN MISTER CHAIR THIS IS THIS IS AN MEMBERS THIS IS A MILD. ARBITRATION BILL THAT I HAVE BEFORE YOU TAKE SO THIS COULD NOT THAT CONCERNED AT THAT SAY -- OTHER TYPE OF IT BASICALLY PROVIDES. A CRUCIAL PROCESS FOR CONSUMERS AND WORKERS -- TO USE WHEN THEY WHEN THEIR FIRST AND FORCE OUT OF COURT BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY HAVE AN ARBITRATION AGREEMENT AND A PLUMBING CONTRACTOR A CONSUMER CONTRACT AND NOW THEY'RE BEING DENIED THEIR RECOURSE AND AN ARBITRATION THAT. HI STAFF REPORT AS A BRILLIANT -- A JOB OF POINTING OUT THAT MANDATORY ARBITRATION PROVISIONS ARE EVERYWHERE HELLO ALL OVER HALF OF AMERICA'S WORKFORCE SEVEN SIDE FORCED TO SIGN MANDATORY ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AS A CONDITION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT -- WITH WORKERS CONSUMERS BARRED ESSENTIALLY FROM GOING INTO COURTS BUSINESSES ARE ABLE TO STRATEGICALLY WITH FULL PAYMENT AND OBSTRUCT THE PROCEEDING -- AND THE ABILITY TO PURSUE THE CLAIM -- THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT THE POULTRY SITUATION -- THE THE UBER -- CIRCUMSTANCES SB SEVEN OH SEVEN THE SEVEN OH SEVEN LAYS OUT THE PROCESS AND THE PENALTIES FOR THIS TYPE OF BEHAVIOR. THE BILL ALSO ADDS THAT THE SAME REPORTING COURT REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE RICH OF ARBITRATORS DEMOGRAPHICS IS ALREADY REQUIRED FOR THE JUDICIAL BRANCH. HERE WITH ME IS A MIKE AREAS HE'S THE PRESIDENT OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS AND NO LIEBOWITZ -- WITH THE EMPLOYMENT -- LAWYERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND I URGE MY VOTE. THANK YOU FIRST WITH US PLEASE. THANK YOU SHOULD MAKE IT MORE MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MY NAME IS NOLA LEVEL IT'S I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION. TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB SEVEN OF SEVEN AS IT STANDS THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT PROVIDES NO GUIDANCE TO PARTIES. OR ARBITRATORS AS TO WHAT TO DO WHEN A PARTY FORCING ARBITRATION -- IN AN EMPTY BARN IMPLORE E. -- FAILS TO PAY THE REQUIRED FEES TO PROVIDE THAT VENUE. OVER THE YEARS WE HAVE SEEN pFOR PRE YOUR Q. REALLY STRATEGIC REASONS FAILED TO PAY AT THE OUTSET. OR STOPPED PAYING. IN THE MIDDLE OF AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING. THIS TACTIC HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY COMMON PLACE. IN PART BECAUSE THE OFFENDING PARTY KNOWS THE CALIFORNIA ARBITRATION ACT PROVIDES NO REMEDY FOR GRIEF PARTIES. THE TACTIC HAS BEEN USED IN ALL TYPES OF EMPLOYMENT CASES IMPACT IMPACTING BOTH LOW WAGE HOURLY WORKERS. LIKE WORKERS AT CHIPOTLE AND DRIVERS AT UBER AND LIFT. AND HIGHER PAID EXECUTIVES JUST LAST YEAR I EXPERIENCE THIS TACTIC TWICE IN THE SAME CASE. THE CASE WAS SIMPLE AND EXECUTIVE SUING FOR BREACH OF WRITTEN EMPLOYMENT CONTRACT IN MY CASE. THE COMPANY DELAYED PAYING ITS INITIATION FEE WITH JAMS BECAUSE IT DID NOT WANT MY CLIENT TO BE ABLE TO GET ANY DISCOVERY PRIOR TO MEDIATION. THAT WE HAD SCHEDULED TO TRY TO RESOLVE THE CASE. THE COMPANY THE LATE PAYING THAT INITIAL FEE FOR MORE THAN THREE MONTHS. JAMS AS A MATTER OF POLICY WILL NOT EVEN SCHEDULE A STATUS CONFERENCE WITH AN ARBITRATOR UNTIL BOTH SIDES HAVE PAID THEIR INITIATION FEE. WHEN THE CASE DID NOT SETTLE TO MEDIATION THE COMPANY PAID WE PROCEED TO ARBITRATION? SEVEN MONTHS LATER WE ARE ON THE VERGE OF TRIAL. THE COMPANY OUT THE ARBITRATOR FOR A CONTINUANCE THE ARBITRATOR SAID NOT. SO WITH THE COMPANY DO THEY STOP PAYING THE ARBITRATOR'S FEE. OR THE ARBITRATOR DO. THROW UP HIS HANDS AND SAID THAT'S IT EVERYTHING'S OFF CALENDAR I CAN DO NOTHING UNLESS I'M GETTING PAID. I FILED THE MOTION FOR DEFAULT CLAIMING IT WAS BAD FAITH. AND MY CLIENT HAD TO PAY NINE THOUSAND DOLLARS JUST TO GET THE ARBITRATOR HEAR THE MOTION. AND THEN THE ARMATURE DENIED THE MOTION. SAYING THAT THE CARP CALIFORNIA WHICH IS NOT PROVIDED NO REMEDY AND DID NOT PROVIDE FOR A DEFAULT. IN THE MIDST OF THIS THE COMPANY DECIDED TO START PAYING AGAIN. AND THE ARBITRATOR RESET THE TRIAL SO WHAT ARE THE COMPANY GET BY DELAYING THIS THEY GOT EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANTED. AND THEY GOT A NEW TRIAL DATE LATER THAN THE ORIGINAL TRIAL THE COMPANY SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO FORCE CONSUMERS AND EMPLOYEES IN ARBITRATION. BOB RETAINING THE ABILITY TO GAME THE SYSTEM AND MANIPULATE THE FORM. BY PROVIDING PROCEDURAL OPTIONS AND DETERRENCE MECHANISMS SB SEVEN OF SEVEN WILL ALLOW CONSUMERS EMPLOYEES. TO FULLY VINDICATE THE RATES WE URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU EXODUS PLEASE. CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS MIKE AREAS ON THE PRESIDENT THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO MANAGING PARTNER OF MY LAW FIRM. LET'S FACE IT ARBITRATION IS A FORM THAT -- SERIES COULD YOU SPEAK INTO THE MICROPHONE. THERE TO MAKE SURE YOU'RE PART OF OUR RUSHER ARBITRATION LET'S FACE AN ARBITRATION IS A FORM THAT -- ALREADY FAVORS. CORPORATIONS EMPLOYERS AND SO FORTH -- SO IF YOU'RE GONNA HAVE THAT FORM THAT -- IS TAKING AWAY THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL FOR MOST PEOPLE IN THIS STATE. YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT PROCESS IS AS MUCH AS A JADED IS IT IS. OCCURS AT LEAST -- IN A TIMELY FASHION -- ANYBODY THAT IS BRING A CLAIM FOR APPOINTMENT ISSUES AS IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED OR EVEN ON THE CONSUMER SIDE. IF THEY'RE FORCED AN ARBITRATION AT LEAST THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT ABILITY TO PROCEED WITH THAT FORM -- THIS THIS -- SB SEVERAL SEVERAL WELL LEASE PROVIDE AS IS GUARD BEEN TESTIFIED -- AN ALTERNATIVE OR AT LEAST A REMEDY FOR THE DELAY IN DOING SO -- BUT THE OTHER ISSUE THAT I I WANNA DRESS I THINK -- THE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN -- TEST BIKE -- THE WINNERS ARE APPROPRIATE ASKED YOU HAD AFFECTS EMPLOYMENT CASES BUT IT HAPPENS A LOT AND CONSUMER CASES HAPPENS A LOT BECAUSE MANY THE ARBITRATIONS IN CONSUMER CASES HAVE THE SAME PROBLEM AND THAT IS THAT PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO GET A RESOLUTION. CONSUMER CLAIM AND THERE'S A DELAY BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE ABILITY RESOURCES TO DELAY THIS -- I ALSO ADDRESS WHAT'S ANOTHER PART OF THE BILL WHICH I THINK IS IMPORTANT I'VE BEEN PRACTICING LAW FOR THIRTY FIVE YEARS AND WHEN IT FIRST STARTED. THE JUDICIAL SIDE JUDGES WERE OF ALMOST ALL WHITE AND ALL MALE -- THE PROBLEM WE HAVE NOW IN THE ARBITRATION SYSTEM IS THAT'S THE SAME THING BECAUSE MANY OF THE ARBITRATORS TEND TO BE -- LAWYERS ARE PEOPLE IN THE LATER STAGE OF THEIR CAREER AND I IF YOU'RE GOING TO PROVIDE -- ARBITRATION IS A FORM WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT THE JUDGES THAT HEARING CASES IN THE CIVIL SIDE TEND TO BE DIVERSE E NEED MAKE SURE THAT HAPPENS IN THE ARBITRATION SIDE BECAUSE THAT UNFORTUNATELY IS WHERE MANY OF THESE CASES HAD AND I THINK THIS BILL WILL HELP. US AT LEAST AREN'T MOVING -- THAT PROCESS OF INSURING ARBITRATORS AS DIVERSE AS THE PEOPLE WHO ARE ARBITRARY THEIR CLAIMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE [inaudible] IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THERE ARE FLOCKS CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MAP BROUGHT FOR THE TEAMSTERS IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I'D SAY NONE OPPOSITION. MONEY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED -- FIRST I WANTED TO THINK THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS THE BILL WITH A BILL BEEN ABLE ACTUALLY TO RESOLVE A LOT OF THE ISSUES -- IN THE BILL THAT WE HAD WHEN IT WAS OVER IN THE SENATE AND ARE WORKING TO HOPEFULLY COMING TO RESOLUTION ON THE FINAL POINT WHICH IS WHAT QUALIFIES AS A MATERIAL BREACH VERSUS THE GOOD FAITH DISPUTE -- AS THIS BILL IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED IF YOU FAIL TO PAY WITHIN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME NO MATTER IF THAT IS DUE TO THE INTENTIONAL -- DELAY WITH THE REGARDS THE STRATEGY THAT SOME OF THE SPONSORS MENTIONED BEFORE WHICH WE ACTUALLY DON'T CONDONE OR IF YOU'RE JUST INVOLVED IN A GOOD FAITH DISPUTE WITH REGARDS TO A FEE OR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ARBITRATION. AND WHO'S RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT FEAR ACOSTA TREATS AT THE SAME AND IT AUTOMATICALLY SUBJECTS THE PARTY TO SANCTIONS MONETARY SANCTIONS AND AUTHORIZES THE COURT. TO ISSUE MORE SEVERE SANCTIONS AS WELL -- SO WE HAVE A CONCERN ON THAT ISSUE I'M NOT GOING TO SIT UP HERE AND JUSTIFY ANY INTENTIONAL DE -- EFFORT ON BEHALF OF A COMPANY TO FAIL TO PAY ARBITRATION IN ORDER TO PREVENT SOMEBODY A CONSUMER OR EMPLOYEE A GETTING A REMEDY OR JUSTICE IN THIS CASE. BUT WHAT WE DO HAVE CONCERNS WITH IS WITH REGARDS TO WHEN THERE IS A GOOD FAITH DISPUTE -- THERE HAS COME UP SOME ISSUES THAT WE ARE AWARE OF WITH REGARDS TO GOOD FAITH DISPUTE ONE OF THE CASES THAT THEY MENTION AS WITH REGARDS TO THE GIG ECONOMY WORKERS AND DRIVERS WHO ARE PURSUING ARBITRATION AND WILD A LOT OF THOSE CASES ARE MOVING FORWARD AND THAT -- FEES ARE BEING PAID THERE IT HAS BECOME A CONCERN WITH REGARDS TO A LOT OF THESE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN SIGNED UP -- UNBEKNOWNST TO THEM AND THEY PURSUED ARBITRATION AND ACTUALLY DON'T WANT TO PURSUE ARBITRATION OR CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SO THE COMPANY IN THAT SITUATION IS QUESTIONING THEIR PAYMENT OF THE ARBITRATION FEES AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ARBITRATION OF THE INDIVIDUAL THEMSELVES ACTUALLY DOES NOT WANT TO PROCEED WITH THE ARBITRATION -- THERE'S ALSO FEW DISPUTES THAT COME UP WITH REGARDS TO CONSUMER PATRICIAN AS WELL -- SO WITH THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE SPONSORING THE AUTHOR TO TRAIN ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES AND HOPEFULLY COME TO A RESOLUTION WHERE YOU CAN DISTINGUISH BETWEEN A GOOD FAITH DISPUTE IN AN INTENTIONAL DENIAL OF THE PAYMENT OF A FEE -- A COUPLE OF POINTS THAT I DIDN'T WANT TO RAISE JUST TO ADDRESS AS WELL I HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY OF HERE WITH REGARD STARBIRD REGION FIRST I DON'T THINK THIS BILL IS ONLY APPLICABLE -- TO ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS THAT ARE MADE AS A CONTRACTOR BUT HE CHEN MEANING BASICALLY THERE IS A TAKE IT OR LEAVE IT SITUATION I THINK IT'S APPLICABLE TO ANY ARBITRATION AGREEMENT. THAT MAYBE YOU RATE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO BUY CONSUMER EMPLOYEE -- SO I DON'T THINK IT'S JUST WITH REGARDS TO THE FORCED ARBITRATION ISSUE THAT HAS -- COME UP WHICH WE DISAGREE WITH -- AND ALSO A COUPLE OF POINTS WITH REGARDS THE ANALYSIS THAT I WANTED TO JUST RAISE -- IF I MAY. MY WE HAVE A CHANCE -- ONE OF THE COMMENTS IN THERE IS THAT THESE ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS DO NOT NEED TO BE IN WRITING THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT THE CASE WITH REGARDS EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS IS THE SUPREME COURT NUMBER THERE IS A SAID. THAT A DECISION HAS TO BE ISSUED IN WRITING -- THE COMING ALSO IS THAT THESE ARBITRATIONS -- ARE IN A PRIVATE AND ARE NEVER IT PUBLICLY DISCLOSED ACTUALLY IN CALIFORNIA WE DO HAVE A QUARTERLY DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT FOR ALL ALL ARBITRATION COMPANIES TO POST ON THEIR WEBSITE -- A SPREADSHEET A SEARCHABLE SPREADSHEET THAT INCLUDES THE AWARDS THAT HAVE BEEN ISSUED IN ADDITION TO ADD A SEVERAL OTHER REQUIREMENTS WITH REGARDS TO CONSUMER AND EMPLOYMENT ARBITRATION. AND THERE'S ALSO A COMMENT THAT A COMPANY CAN CONTINUE TO RECEIVE AN AWARD FROM AN ARBITRATOR NOBODY WOULD EVER KNOW AGAIN THAT ISN'T A PART OF THE QUARTERLY REQUIRED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. AND BEFORE AN ARBITRATION PANEL IS EVER DECIDED MEANING THE EMPLOYEE OR THE CONSUMER GETS TO PICK THAT ARBITRATOR THEY'RE REQUIRED TO OBTAIN DISCLOSURES ON HOW MANY TIMES THAT ARBITRATOR HAS HADDOCK A CASE WITH THAT COMPANY. AND THE AWARDS AND DECISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN BATES OF THEIR FULLY AWARE BEFORE THEY EVEN PICK THE ARBITRATOR WHAT THE OUTCOMES OF THE PREVIOUS CASES HAVE BEEN. FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WILL ULTIMATELY BE ABLE TO OBTAIN A RESOLUTION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ALRIGHT SAY NONE SENATOR YOU MAY CLOSE YES I THINK IT'S AN IMPROVEMENT AS THE CURRENT SITUATION AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ARE STILL LOOKING FOR A MOTION. THANK YOU WE HAVE A MOTION IS OUR SECOND. ADD A SECOND THANK YOU MOTION IS DO PASS. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE GALLAGHER. CHAO. CHU. CHU AYE GABRIEL HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. OUR AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN OBERNOLTE. OBERNOLTE NO PETRIE-NORRIS REYES. THAT NEEDS A FEW MORE VOTES THREE MORE SO WE'LL PUT IT ON THANK YOU. THANK YOU. SENATOR GLAZER. BRINGS US TO ITEM NUMBER. EIGHT SB. SIX FORTY FOUR MORNING MORNING MR CHAIRMAN THANK YOU FOR A HEARING THIS BILL. SB SIX FORTY FOUR WOULD PROVIDE RENT RENTAL RELIEF TO ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS BASED IN CALIFORNIA. BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF SECURITY DEPOSIT SERVICE MEMBERS REQUIRED TO PAY TO MOVE INTO A RENTAL UNIT. SB SIX FORTY FOUR WOULD ALSO PROHIBIT LANDLORDS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST SERVICE MEMBERS FOR HAVING TO PAY LAST SECURITY DEPOSIT. IN ADDITION -- SB TWO TWO TWO BY SENATOR HILL IN FORCES THIS PROVISION BY PROHIBITING DISCRIMINATION IN THE RENTAL MARKET BASED ON VETERAN OR MILITARY STATUS. CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING CRISIS MAKES IT PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS. TO FOR THE UP FRONT COSTS OF MOVING INTO A RENTAL UNIT IN CALIFORNIA. WITH MILITARY BARRACKS BECOMING SCARCER. THE NEED FOR SERVICE MEMBERS -- TO TO FIND HOUSING IN THE COMMUNITY WHERE THEIR STATION IS INCREASINGLY COMMON -- I THE EFFECT THIS BILL WAS BROUGHT TO ME BY SERVICE MEMBERS FROM CAMP PARK WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT -- IT STATIONED IN DUBLIN. ALTHOUGH SERVICE MEMBERS RECEIVE A BASIC ALLOWANCE FOR HOUSING FOR THE MILITARY IT'S OFTEN NOT ENOUGH TO COVER THE UP FRONT COST OF RENTING IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE SERVICE MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA RECEIVE A LARGER ALLOWANCE. DUE TO THE HIGHER COST OF LIVING IT CAN TAKE MONTHS FOR THE ALLOWANCE -- INCREASE TO TAKE EFFECT WHEN SERVICE MEMBERS MOVE HERE FROM OTHER STATES. THIS FORCES SERVICE MEMBERS DOCTORS OR TO LOANS OR OTHER FORMS OF CREDIT TO PAY THEIR SECURITY DEPOSIT IN FIRST MONTH'S RENT -- THIS MEASURE WILL ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND MAKE SURE ACTIVE DUTY SERVICE MEMBERS ARE ABLE TO AFFORD. RENT WHILE SERVING. THE BILL SUPPORTED BY MANY VETERANS GROUPS INCLUDING THE AMERICAN GI FORUM AND THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES. WITH ME IS A MR NICHOLS ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN GI FORUM FOR CALIFORNIA AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR RIVAL TODAY. THANK YOU CHRISTMAS BUT GOOD MORNING DANA NICKEL WITH READ THE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS REPRESENTING THE FOLLOWING VETERANS GROUPS IN SUPPORT. THE AMERICAN GI FORUM OF CALIFORNIANS AMVETS DEPARTMENT OF CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA STATE COMMANDERS VETERANS COUNCIL VIETNAM VETERANS OF AMERICA CALIFORNIA COUNCIL STATE A COUNCIL. MILITARY ORDER OF MILITARY OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF AMERICA OF CALIFORNIA AND THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COUNTY VETERANS SERVICE OFFICERS IN SUPPORT. OF THE MILITARY ORGANIZATIONS WE ARE PERCENT BELIEVE THAT THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY AND ARE BASED IN THE STATE MERIT YOUR HIGHEST CONSIDERATION FOR THE RENTAL RELIEF THAT SB. SIX FORTY FOUR PROVIDES. WHEN I WAS OUT IN THE AUDIENCE I -- FOUND A STATISTIC THAT SAID THERE'S OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND MILITARY MEMBERS IN CALIFORNIA ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THEM. ARE WITH THE NAVY OR THE MARINE CORPS AND THE NAVY AND THE MARINE CORPS NORMALLY STATION NEAR THE COAST. AND WE KNOW THAT THE NEAR THE COAST IS WORSE FOR THE HIGHEST CONSULATE IN YOUR SOUL -- ALSO. IF. IT IS DIFFICULT TO A DIFFERENT STATE WITH A SHORT NOTICE AFTER BEING STATIONED SOMEWHERE ELSE FOR YEARS BUT SERVICE MEMBERS TO IT AND THEY DO IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTAND. WHAT THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE ARMED FORCES MEANS WHAT IS MORE DIFFICULT FOR SERVICE MEMBERS AND THEIR FAMILIES TO UNDER IS THE STRESSFUL PROCESS OF FINDING HOUSING IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME? WHEN THEY ARE ORDERED TO CALIFORNIA THIS PROBLEM IS COMPOUNDED BY THE LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING? SERVICE MEMBERS MUST HAVE SOME KIND OF RELIEF SB SIX FORTY FOUR IS A FAIR IN THIS IS SHERRY APPROACH TO MITIGATING THE PROBLEM SERVICE MEMBERS FACE WHEN THE MOVE TO CALIFORNIA. THE UNIFORM CODE OF MILITARY JUSTICE ALSO CODIFIES THE STANDARD OF CONDUCT THAT SERVICE MEMBERS MUST FOLLOW WHICH PROVIDE SUFFICIENT PROTECTION FOR LANDLORDS LOOKING TO RECOUP ANY LOSSES. AS MENTIONED BEFORE IF FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ARE NOT MEANT SERVICE MEMBERS CAN FACE A MYRIAD OF DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THE BILL. OKAY WE DO HAVE A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND AND A SECONDS. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS ALEX TAURUS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF VETERANS SERVICE AGENCIES IN SUPPORT THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. I THINK THAT IS THEIR OPPOSITION. I'D SAY NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS MR OBERNOLTE. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AT CENTER I THINK YOU'RE GET AN IMPORTANT ISSUE HERE HAPPY TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL I HAD ONE QUESTION THOUGH IN. A READING THE WAY THAT THE BILL AS DRAFTED -- YOU'VE GOT PARAGRAPH TWO WHICH ESTABLISHES THIS LIMITATION OF ONE MONTH SECURITY DEPOSIT. FOR THE MEMBERS THE ARMED FORCES THAT FIT INTO THIS CATEGORY BUT THEN YOU'VE GOT -- SECTION A THAT SAYS A LANDLORD MAY DEMAND OR RECEIVE SECURITY FROM A SERVICE MEMBER. WHO RENTS RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY IN WHICH THE SERVICE MEMBER WILL RESIDE? IF THE TENANT HAS A HISTORY OF POOR CREDIT OR CAUSING DAMAGE TO THE RENTAL PROPERTY OR ITS FURNISHINGS AND I FOUND THAT VERY CONFUSINGLY WRITTEN BECAUSE I DON'T UNDERSTAND I MEAN. THAT THE LANDLORD ALREADY MAY DEMAND SECURITY FROM THOSE PEOPLE I THINK YOU'RE TRYING TO EXEMPT. LANDLORDS FROM THAT SECTION. IN THE EVENT THAT A SERVICE MEMBER HAS POOR CREDIT HISTORY -- YOU'VE ALSO GOT THIS PARAGRAPH BE THIS SECTION BE THAT SAYS THIS PARAGRAPH DOES NOT APPLY TO A SITUATION IN WHICH THE PROPERTIES MANAGER GROUP OF INDIVIDUALS AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO SAY IN PARAGRAPH A AS WELL BUT IT WASN'T CLEAR TO ME. THROUGH THE CHAIR -- WE DID AMEND THE BILL TO TO TRY TO CLARIFY THIS CORRECTLY AND IF IT'S NOT CLARIFY CORRECTLY I'M HAPPY TO GO BACK AND REVISIT THAT BUT IT'S REALLY MEANT TO EXEMPTS THE IF THEY HAVE A BAD CREDIT RATING. A CREDIT HISTORY -- THIS BILL WOULDN'T APPLY THAT'S THE INTENTION SO IN OTHER WORDS THE PARAGRAPH TO WOULDN'TAPPLY YOU GO BACK TO THE INTERPRETATION OF PARAGRAPH ONE WHICH MEANS THAT THEY CAN A MAN TWO MONTHS REST. THAT'S CORRECT OKAY. OKAY WELL THANKS I JUST I FOUND THAT CONFUSING. AND I'M HAPPY TO CLARIFY AND MAKE SURE IT'S BEEN WRITTEN CORRECTLY BUT THAT WAS THE PURPOSE OF THE AMENDMENT THERE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE SANITY MAKEOVER THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND FOR YOUR CONCERN FOR OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND WHAT THEY GO THROUGH.

TEN SB SEVEN FORTY NINE DO YOU HAVE A PREFERENCE. ALRIGHT SO I'VE NEVER SEVEN SB THANK YOU MORNING. GOOD MORNING GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND UP MEMBERS -- I WANNA START BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES SUGGESTED CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS REFERENCED ON PAGE NINE OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. AND THANK YOUR STAFF FOR THE WORK ON THIS MEASURE. UP IN TWENTY ELEVEN ICE DEVELOPED THE OPERATIONS PERFORMANCE BASED NATIONAL DETENTION STANDARDS WHICH LAYS OUT THE BASIC HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS. DETAINEES SHOULD RECEIVE WHILE IN DETENTION. HOWEVER THE STANDARDS ARE NOT CODIFIED AND THEREFORE NOT CURRENTLY ENFORCEABLE. THERE HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT REPORTS OF HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES IN DETENTION FACILITIES. INCLUDING PHYSICAL AND SEXUAL ABUSE POR ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. LITTLE ACCESS TO LEGAL COUNSEL OVER USE OF SOLITARY CONFINEMENT AND EVEN DEATHS. OVER THE LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR AND DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA HAVE RAISED ALARM MEAN ISSUES AT IMMIGRATION DETENTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA. SINCE MARCH OF TWENTY TEN ICE AS REPORTED TOTAL OF EIGHTY THREE DEATHS NATIONALLY. IN ADULT IMMIGRATION DETENTION CENTERS. IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THERE BEEN AT LEAST. THIRTEEN ASSOCIATED WITH IMMIGRATION DETENTION. INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXPERTS HAVE FOUND THAT IN TWENTY THREE CASES. INADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE CONTRIBUTED TO THESE FATALITIES. THE AUDITOR FOUND THREE CITIES IN PARTICULAR OTHER LANDEL MCFARLAND AND HOLD BILL. SUBCONTRACTED TO PRIVATE OPERATORS NEARLY ALL OF THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES UNDER THEIR ICE CONTRACTS. INCLUDING PROVIDING DETAINEES WITH HOUSING SAFE KEEPING SUBSISTENCE AND MEDICAL SERVICES. THE CITY'S PROVIDE LITTLE OR NO OVERSIGHT OF THE PRIVATE OPERATORS AND SIMPLY PASSED FEDERAL PAYMENTS FROM ICE. TO THESE SUBCONTRACTORS DESPITE THAT FEDERAL INSPECTIONS HAVE FOUND SERIOUS SAFETY PROBLEMS -- SERVICE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROBLEMS AT THESE FACILITIES. FOR EXAMPLE A RECENT FEDERAL INSPECTION OF THE OTHER ALLOWED THE DETENTION FACILITY REPORTED ONE SUICIDE AND THREE SUICIDE ATTEMPTS. INADEQUATE DENTAL CARE AND CURSORY MEDICAL ASSESSMENTS. THESE INCIDENTS OFTEN GO UNADDRESSED AND VICTIMS HAVE NO RECOURSE. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE DIRECTED THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO RVIEW THESE FACILITIES TO PROVIDE GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT THE CONDITIONS OF CONFINEMENT CONFINEMENT. A DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA INVESTIGATION REVEALED THAT WHEN CONDITIONS IN A DETENTION FACILITY FALL BELOW PREVAILING LEGAL AND OTHER STANDARDS IT IS PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES. FOR AMONG THE MOST LIKELY TO SUFFER THE HARMS THAT RESULT -- OF AB SB SIX TWENTY TWO REQUIRES CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES. TO IMMEDIATELY NOTIFY THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL OF ANY DEATH IN CIVIL CUSTODY. THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE WILL ASSUME JURISDICTION OVER THE INVESTIGATION OF THE DEATH AND WILL IMMEDIATELY OPEN AN INVESTIGATION INTO THE CAUSE AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE DEATH. THIS BILL WILL CREATE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE CIVIL DETENTION FACILITIES CURRENTLY OPERATING IN CALIFORNIA. INDEED PRIVATE COMPANIES MAKE BILLIONS IN PROFITS EVERY YEAR FROM INCARCERATED MOTHERS FATHERS CHILDREN AND OTHERS IN OUR BROKEN IMMIGRATION SYSTEM. IT IS EVEN MORE CRUCIAL NOW THAN EVER BEFORE THE CALIFORNIA INSIST ON HUMANE AND JUST TREATMENT FOR ALL INCARCERATED IN OUR STATE. WITNESSES WITH ME TODAY ARE MELISSA CASTRO FROM LOS ANGELES AND WE'RE CELL RES WITH THE IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER AND MEET. INTRODUCE YOURSELF AS WELL THANK YOU THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE -- GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD MORNING -- THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY -- MY NAME IS MELISSA CASTRO AND I'M FROM LOS ANGELES. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT MY EXPERIENCE WITH ICE. JOSE LUCY BUT ARE BOTH STILL WAS MY HUSBAND AND THE FATHER OF OUR NOW FOUR MONTH OLD SON. IN LATE JANUARY TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN HE WAS DETAINED BY ICE AND EVENTUALLY WAS TAKEN TO THE OF THE MONTH -- DETENTION CENTER AND OTHER MONTH OF CALIFORNIA. FOUR DAYS AFTER GIVING BIRTH I RECEIVED A CALL FROM A STATING THAT MY HUSBAND WAS AT THE LOMA LINDA HOSPITAL -- DUE TO A PASSING OUT EPISODE. UPON MY ARRIVAL I WAS INFORMED BY DOCTORS THAT IT WAS ACTUALLY -- HE ACTUALLY HAD SUFFERED FROM A BRAIN HEMORRHAGE. WHILE HE WAS -- AT THE HOSPITAL UNDER ICE CUSTODY HE WAS HANDCUFFED TO THE BED BY HIS FOOT -- EVEN AFTER I WAS INFORMED THAT HE WAS IN AND AN INTENSIVE COMA AND MEDICALLY PARALYZED HE WAS ALSO GUARDED BY -- TWO GUARDS. WHICH WERE INSIDE HIS ROOM THE TWENTY FOUR HOURS. I WAS ALSO INFORMED BY THE GUARDS AND THE DOCTORS. THAT THE DOCTORS WERE NOT ALLOWED TO DISCLOSE ANY INFORMATION TO ME REGARDING WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND. BEFORE HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THAT SPECIFIC HOSPITAL. AS HIS WIFE I WANTED TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO HIM BEFORE HE GOT THERE. WHAT PROTOCOLS WERE TAKEN IN ORDER? TO ENSURE THAT MY HUSBAND RECEIVE THE PROPER CARE. I WAS LATER INFORMED BY THE DOCTORS DURING ONE OF OUR DISCUSSIONS BUT HE WAS IN FACT ACTUALLY TRANSFERRED NOT FROM THE FACILITY BUT FROM A PREVIOUS HOSPITAL. THE NIGHT BEFORE [inaudible] THIS REYES. QUESTIONS FOR MYSELF AND FOR MY FAMILY WHY WAS I NOT INFORMED IMMEDIATELY UPON -- UPON HIS ARRIVAL TO THE FIRST HOSPITAL WHEN DID THE INITIAL INCIDENT OCCUR. HOW LONG WAS HE AT THE AYE FACILITY BEFORE HE WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE HOSPITAL AND WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED THAT LED ICE TO TAKE HIM TO THE HOSPITAL? THESE ARE JUST SOME OF THE FEW QUESTIONS THAT WE ARE STILL. ASKING -- THAT WE DON'T HAVE ANSWERS. TO MY HUSBAND WAS RELEASED FROM ICE BECAUSE CITY WHILE HE WAS STILL IN THE HOSPITAL AND STILL UNCONSCIOUS HE PASSED AWAY TWO WEEKS LATER. AS HIS WIFE. IT PAINS ME TO KNOW THAT HE IS NO LONGER WITH US BUT HE NEVER MET HIS SON. AND THAT WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED AND WHAT CLOSURE. THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS HAS HAPPENED TO A FAMILY. WHILE THEIR LOVED ONE IS UNDER ICE CUSTODY. I'M HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU. TO VOTE IN FAVOR FOR SENATE BILL SIX TWENTY TWO AS NO FAMILY SHOULD HAVE TO SEE THEIR LOVED ONES AND THOSE CONDITIONS ON THEIR FILE FINAL HOURS. WE SHOULD ALL HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TO OUR LOVE ONES THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR TESTIFIED THAT IS A DIFFICULT STORY WE'RE VERY SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHRIS OUR WAYS AND I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB SIX TWO TWO IF PASSED TAX BETH B. SIXTY TWO WOULD ENSURE THAT THEIR SWEPT INVESTIGATION TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY IF THERE IS A DEATH IN CIVIL CUSTODY IN CALIFORNIA. I'M A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY AT THE IMMIGRANT LEGAL RESOURCE CENTER WE SUPPORT THIS SPELL AND ARE PROUD CO SPONSORS BECAUSE OF THE DOCUMENTED SYSTEMIC FAILURES. IN DETENTION MEDICAL CARE -- IN THE LAW AND THE OBVIOUS FACTS THAT SHOW THAT THEIR LACK OF MEDICAL CARE RESULTS INFREQUENT DEATHS AND ATTENTION I'M INCLUDING OVER A DOZEN IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. A RECORD NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE BEING DETAINED IN IMMIGRATION DETENTION NATIONALLY IN FEBRUARY OF THIS YEAR THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL. REPORTED THAT DURING THE LAST THREE YEARS BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE DETENTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA HOUSE MORE THAN SEVENTY FOUR THOUSAND IMMIGRANT DETAINEES.SINCE MARCH TWO THOUSAND TEN ICE HAS REPORTED OVER AT DEATH METAL IMMIGRATION DETENTION AN INDEPENDENT MEDICAL EXPERTS REVIEWING GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS OBTAINED FAR CO SPONSORS HUMAN RIGHTS WATCH. RELATING TO EVENTS LEADING UP TO FIFTY TWO OF THE STATS FOUND THAT IN TWENTY THREE CASES AN ADEQUATE MEDICAL CARE CONTRIBUTED TO THE FATALITY. IN CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDES PEOPLE LIKE MR FERNANDO THE MINGUS BETTY VIA WHO PASSED AWAY IN MARCH OF TWO THOUSAND TWELVE WHILE DETAINED AT THE AUTO ONTO DETENTION FACILITY. KNOWN AS THE MOST DEADLY DETENTION FACILITY IN THE NATION -- IT THIS DEATH OCCURRED FROM RESULTS AND DELAYS IN ADDRESSING AMMONIA WHICH IS A TREATABLE DISEASE -- THERE IS ALSO ANOTHER INCIDENT MR RAO AN ESTIMATE OF THIS RAMEAU'S WHO SUFFERED FROM SYMPTOMS OF CANCER STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN BUT NEVER SAW A DOCTOR IN TOW. A MONTH BEFORE HE DIED IN APRIL OF TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AT THE AUTO ONTO A DETENTION FACILITY. THE DOCTOR WHO WAS CERTIFIED AS WHO WAS CERTIFIED IN MEDICAL ONCOLOGY TOLD ICE INVESTIGATORS THAT WHEN SHE SAW THAT INDIVIDUAL HE HAD THE LARGEST ABDOMINAL MATCH SHE HAD EVER SEEN IN HER PRACTICE WHICH WAS OF IT VISIBLE THROUGH THE ABDOMINAL WALL. ANOTHER CALIFORNIAN MISTER JOSE AYE AYE SERBIA DIED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AN OFFICER AT THE OTTAWA TO DETENTION FACILITY TOLD THE NURSE THAT HE WAS EL AND VOMITING. THE NURSE TOLD THE TOLD HIM THAT SHE DID NOT WANT TO SEE MISTER ICE WITH THE I. BECAUSE SHE DID NOT WANT TO GET SICK. THIS BEGAN A SERIES OF UNCONSCIONABLE DELAYS WHICH TURNED INTO A FATAL HEART ATTACK. ANOTHER CASE MR HEAD OF CREW SANCHES DIED WHILE DETAINED BY THE US MARSHAL SERVICE AS A MATERIAL WITNESS IN THE OTAY MESA DETENTION FACILITY. ACCORDING TO A WRONGFUL DEATH SUIT FILED BY MR CRUISE SANCIOUS FAMILY MISTER CHRIS SANCHEZ BAG FOR CARE BEFORE HIS DEATH AND WAS ONLY GIVEN ASSISTANCE WHEN AN OFFICER HAPPENED UPON HIM AFTER HE HAD COUGHED UP SO MUCH BLOOD THAT. HIS *-(** CHEEKS WERE SOAKED REGRETTABLY THESE ARE JUST A FEW OF THE CASES THAT WE'VE HAD IN CALIFORNIA. AND REGRETTABLY WE'VE HAD A RECENT DEATH -- IN A WHOSE WHOSE WIDOWS RICK IS HERE WITH US TODAY. I WANT TO THANK SENATOR THE RUSSELL FOR PUTTING FOR THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION WHICH WILL HELP TO ENSURE THAT IF ANOTHER DEATH REGRETTABLY HAPPENS -- THAT OUR STATE WILL RESPOND IMMEDIATELY WITH INVESTIGATION AND ANSWERS AS TO THE CAUSE OF DEATH -- TO HOPEFULLY ENSURE THAT SUCH THAT SUCH THAT'S NEVER HAPPEN AGAIN.

THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND I WILL GO TO ITEM NUMBER TEN SB SEVEN FORTY NINE YES PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- FIRST I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR EXCELLENT AND VERY COMPREHENSIVE ANALYIS OF THIS BILL. OF IT ALSO LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS AS DETAILED ON GIVE ME JUST SEVEN AND EIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. SB SEVEN FOUR NINE IS A NARROW APPROACH FOR PUBLIC ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION ABOUT PUBLIC CONTRACTS. AND PROVIDING TRANSPARENCY IN HOW HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS. IN TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT. MY BILL WOULD MAKE CLEAR THAT INFORMATION IN A PUBLIC CONTRACT. THAT IS IN THE POSSESSION OF A PUBLIC AGENCY. PERTAINING TO JOB CREATION JOB QUALITY AND JOB RETENTION AS WELL AS BY AMERICA FEDERAL LAWS COMPLIANCE. IS NOT A TRADE SECRET UNDER THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. IN FACT CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE CONSISTENTLY RULED THAT THIS INFORMATION IS NOT A TRADE SECRET AND IS SUBJECT TO DISCLOSURE. SB SOME FORTY NINE POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE USED IN A RESPONSIBLE WAY. AS A GLOBAL ECONOMIC LEADER CALIFORNIA'S STRIVES TO GOVERN AND PURCHASE FOR THE COMMON GOOD. OUR STATE HAS LONG COMMITTED TO RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING POLICIES BUT TO ACHIEVE FULLY THE GOALS OF RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTING. ACCESS TO KEY INFORMATION IS VITAL. WITHOUT ACCESS TO INFORMATION ABOUT JOBS HOW CAN WE BE POSITIVE THAT ARE PURCHASING POWER REWARDS RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS AND COMPANIES. EARNING PROFITS WITH OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS [inaudible] INCREASINGLY RECORDS RELATED TO WAGES BENEFITS JOB QUALITY RETENTION AND TRAINING PROGRAMS ARE REDACTED FROM PUBLIC DOCUMENTS AT THE REQUEST OF COMPANIES. CLAIMING AN EXEMPTION TO THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT. CALIFORNIANS DESERVE A FAIR RETURN ON OUR TAXES AND THE ONLY WAY TO KNOW IF WE ARE GETTING WHAT WE BARGAINED. FOR IS GETTING INFORMATION RELATED TO JOBS. IN THIS IS BE SEVEN FORTY NINE IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR CALIFORNIA TO BE A LEADER. IN MAKING SURE OUR TAX DOLLARS ARE TRULY CREATING JOBS AND JOB QUALITY. TODAY WE HAVE EXPERTS AS EXPERTS SAID THIRD VS BENJAMIN COLBERT CHECK. UP WILLIE SOLARE SUNAL AND OF THE LAST SHOT BOLEH [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING I'D CHAIR STONE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS BEN KAMAL CHECK I'M ASSOCIATE TURN AT THE LAW FIRM A CRACK INSTRUMENT IN HOLES VERY -- MY PRACTICE CONSISTS OF REPRESENTING UNIONS WORKERS AND NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS. THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT PLAYS A CRUCIAL ROLE IN ENSURING GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY BY PROVIDING THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT RECORDS AND DOCUMENTS. HOWEVER IS BECOME EXCEEDINGLY COMMON FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES THAT RECEIVE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS OR SUBSIDIES TO SUE AGENCIES TO BLOCK DISCLOSURE OF RECORDS RELATED TO HOW THOSE CONTRACTS FOR GRANTED. RECENTLY NEW FIRE THE LARGEST BUS MANUFACTURER IN NORTH AMERICA ATTENDED TO USE THIS TECHNIQUE TO CONCEAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE WAGE BENEFIT AND JOB CREATION. PROMISES THEY MADE TO OBTAIN A FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR CONTRACT FROM LA METRO. THIS IS ESPECIALLY CAN -- CONCERNING CONSIDERING THE GROWING COMMITMENT IN CALIFORNIA -- TO UTILIZE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING SUBSIDY PROCESS SEES -- FOR BROADER SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC IMPACT. PRIVATE COMPANIES ARE WARDED GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND SUBSIDIES IN EXCHANGE FOR MAKING THESE KINDS OF PROMISES TO THE PUBLIC. IF COMPANIES CAN CLAIM THE JOB PROCUREMENT INFORMATION AS A TRADE SECRET THE WORKING PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA CAN'T NO FEES PROMISES ARE BEING CAT. A FURTHER THE ABILITY FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES TO PURSUE COSTLY LITIGATION RESPONSES HE PARA QUEST. MUSCLE THE PUBLIC OUT OF UTILIZING THE CPR A AND PUBLIC AGENCIES ARE FORCED INTO A A DIFFICULT POSITION BETWEEN THEIR CBRE OBLIGATIONS. AND THE THREAT OF COSTLY LITIGATION FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES. SB SEVEN FORTY NINE ADDRESSES BY CLEAR FIND A NARROW CATEGORY OR NARAL CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS -- RELATED TO JOB CREATION IN QUALITY AND PROCUREMENT IT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A TRADE SECRET UNDER THE EXEMPTION THE CPR A THIS BILL SUPPORTING BY EXISTING LAW. WELL BY CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATE EXEMPTIONS FROM THE COMPEL DISCLOSURE MUST BE NARROWLY CONSTRUED. I THE CPR INCORPORATES A TRADE SECRET EXEMPTION ONLY INDIRECTLY THROUGH REFERENCE TO A CONDITIONAL PRIVILEGE AND THE EVIDENTIARY CODE. NO CORPS IN CALIFORNIA HAS FOUND THAT THE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS INCLUDING SB SEVEN FORTY NINE R. TRADE SECRETS UNDER THE CPR A EVEN IF. SIR TO TRADE SECRET UNDER THE SEA PARA YOU MUST THEN DO A BALANCING TEST. BETWEEN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN THE CLOTHES AND DISCLOSURE AND THE CLAIMS TRADE SECRET. THE PUBLIC INTEREST STRONGLY FAVORS DISCLOSURE OF THE DOCUMENTS INCLUDE IN SB. SEVEN FORTY NINE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS CONCLUDED THAT ACCESS TO BID DOCUMENTS IS REQUIRED ON THE CPR. CALIFORNIA STRONG PUBLIC POLICY BECAUSE THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF EMPLOYEE WAGES. AND COURTS OF REGULARLY HELD THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION SUBMITTED TO THE GOVERNMENT IS THIS CLOSABLE. IN THE LAWSUIT BROUGHT BY NEW FLYER THE COURT CONSIDERED THAT PUBLIC POLICY. AND HOW THAT THE PUBLIC INTEREST IN DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION RELATED TO HOW NEW FLYER WITH ABLE TO OBTAIN A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR MAKING THESE KINDS OF PROMISES. OUTWEIGHED ANY POTENTIAL COMPETITIVE HARM RESULTING FROM DISCLOSURE. SIMILARLY THE CATEGORIES OF DOCUMENTS IN SB SEVEN FORTY NINE PROVIDE SIMPLE -- CLEAR FINE -- DIRECTION TO THE COURTS -- SO THAT THE THESE PROMISES MADE TO CALIFORNIA'S COMMUNITIES CAN BE CAPPED. I WANT -- TO SIR I NEED TO TO WRAP UP YES -- THANK YOU HAVE AVAILABLE FOR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU A SERVICE PLEASE MR MEMBERS AS ARE THE OTHER ME HALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL PRADA SUPPORT THIS BILL WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF ADJUSTING PROCUREMENT POLICIES AS A REALLY TO CONSTRUCTION FOR TRANSPARENCY. AND ACCOUNTABILITY -- BUT WE ALSO ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROCUREMENT EASEMENT SO THAT WE ARE BALANCING OUT THE NEEDS OF THE CONTRACTORS WITH THE NEEDS OF THE PUBLICATIONS HE'S. ONE OF THOSE SUCH -- EASEMENTS AS BASICALLY PRE QUALIFICATION. SO A A SCHOOL DISTRICT FOR EXAMPLE HAS TO PRE QUALIFY IT THEIR CONTRACTORS WHEN A CONTRACTOR SEEKS TO WORK ON A STATE BOND FUNDED PROJECT. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THE CONTRACTORS ARE WINNING THE BITS BUT IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO BID THEIR PROVIDING KEY IN NECESSARY INFORMATION SET THE SCHOOL DISTRICT KNOWS WHO THEY'RE ACTUALLY INTO GOING INTO BUSINESS WITH. THAT IS -- WAGE VIOLATIONS HEALTH AND SAFETY THEIR FINANCIAL STANDARD TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE SECURE AND NOT GOING TO ACCEPT THE CONTRACT AND THEN GO BELLY UP THAT INVESTMENT THAT THE STATE BOND -- PAYERS ARE MAKING INTO THAT PARTICULAR PROJECT IS SIGNIFICANT NEW WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE MOST RESPONSIBLE CONTRACTORS ALL THE ONES THAT ARE WORKING ON THOSE PROJECTS. SO THAT'S ONE ANOTHER METHOD IS BEST VALUE WHEN YOU LOOK WHEN YOU LOOK AT BEST VALUE PROJECT YOU'RE NOT DELIVERING IT BASED ON THE LOWEST RESPONSIBLE BIDDER YOU'RE LOOKING AT OTHER FACTORS THAT. BASICALLY THE TERM WITH THAT CONTRACTOR IS GOING TO BE BETTER BETTER IN TERMS OF QUALITY OR OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES LIKE THERE DON'T HAVE WAIT LET WAGE VIOLATIONS A KERRY WORKERS COMP TO HAVE A GOOD HISTORY WORKING. IN THOSE PARTICULAR COMPLEX PROJECTS SO BECAUSE OF THAT MAYBE THEIR BID IS A LITTLE BIT HIGHER BUT YOU'RE GETTING THE BEST VALUE OUT OF IT. BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN YOU'RE SACRIFICING LABOR STANDARDS AND WAGES ALL ALL AND ENCOMPASSING SO WE THINK THAT THE EVOLUTION OF PROCUREMENT PRACTICES AND ALSO PROJECT DELIVERY METHODS SUCH AS MANUFACTURING. NEED TO BE CAUGHT UP TO SPEED AND THIS LAW ENSURES THAT THAT INVESTMENT WITH THERE BEING MANUFACTURED HOMES OR WHETHER IT BE IN -- MANUFACTURED MODULAR BUILDINGS FOR SCHOOLS THAT THE X. THE WAGES AND THE BENEFITS THAT ARE PAID TO THOSE WORKERS ARE NOT POSSIBLE SACRIFICE IN AN EXTENT TO PROVIDE SOME KIND OF SUBSIDY TO THE ACTUAL RECIPIENT. WE THINK THAT OUT AS THE STATE IS A MARKET PARTICIPANT IN A LOT OF THESE INVESTMENTS IT IS INHERENTLY THEIR BEST IN THEIR BEST INTEREST TO ENSURE THAT ACCESS TO PUBLIC INFORMATION. SUCH AS JOB CREATION AND COMMITMENTS ARE ACTUALLY FULFILL FOR THOSE USED WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU ALLOW ONE MORE WITNESS HI GOOD MORNING TWENTY MEMBERS MY NAME IS OF THE WASHABLE AND THE CALIFORNIA SENIOR POLICY COORDINATOR AT DROPS TO MOVE AMERICA. AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL [inaudible] THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT VERY GOOD YES YOU HARM HAVE THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. IGNITES YOUR HERNANDEZ I'M WE HAVE THE COMMUNICATION WORKERS OF AMERICA JUST DISTRICT NINE SUPPORT. STEVE GORMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY STRONG SUPPORT. WE SOLANO WITH MARK ONE OF FIVE UNIT IN FULL SUPPORT. SIR FLUX CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. WRITING THAT IS THEIR OPPOSITION. I KNOW IT'S LATE IN THE MORNING -- GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBER COMMITTEE -- ROBERT MUTRIE WITH CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED -- FIRST OF LUCK I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO THANK STAFF FOR THE FOR ANALYSIS AND FOR THE AMENDMENTS WHICH I DO THINK CLARIFY THE BILL. WHICH IS YOU KNOW CLARITY IS ALWAYS BEST HERE AT LEAST -- WE HAVE FOR PARTICULAR CONCERNS FIRST -- YOU KNOW. TO BE CLEAR WE DO NOT ALLOW I'M NOT HERE TO SAY THAT IN EVERY CASE HAS BEEN ASSERTED THAT THESE ARE YOU KNOW HAVE BEEN TREATED WITH ABSOLUTELY NOT. RIGHT BUT WHAT WE COULD DO THINK IS IMPORTANT IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT HAVING THE JUDICIAL PROCESS RIGHT TO DETERMINE IN A CASE BY CASE BASIS BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE TRADE SECRET LAW. IS A DEFINING CALIFORNIA LAW IS AN IMPORTANT VALUE -- PARTICULARLY AND I I WOULD NOT GET THIS PROBLEMS IF THEY WOULDN'T BE RELEVANT LATER -- TRADE SECRET LAW I BELIEVE AS REFERENCED HAS TWO PRONGS IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT. THE INFORMATION IS VALUABLE TO YOU OR YOUR COMPETITOR -- THAT IT BE KEPT SECRET AND YOU MUST MAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO KEEP IT SECRET -- THAT'S RELEVANT AS I GO FORWARD TO THE NEXT ISSUE HERE -- THE APPLICATION IS BILL GOES WELL BEYOND THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AS HE READ -- BECAUSE OF THE SECOND PROBLEM. BUSINESS OR TO MAINTAIN TRADE SECRET PROTECTION MUST TAKE REASONABLE EFFORTS TO MAINTAIN THE SECRECY THAT INFORMATION. OUR CONCERN EVEN YOU KNOW GOING BEYOND. ERASING THESE CONFIDENTIAL DOCUMENTS FROM SENTRY TRAITS YOUR FASHION ON OF THE ACT. THE PROBLEM IS IF I AS A BUSINESS SUBMIT FOR CONTRACT -- AND TEN YEARS LATER AFTER THE CITY HAS PURGE THEIR RECORDS RETENTION SCHEDULE AND AFTER THEY NO LONGER HAVE THE DOCUMENT. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THAT IT'S NOW WAVE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION IN SUBSEQUENT LITIGATION. BECAUSE IF IF WE ARE ON OPPOSITE SIDES ALLEGATIONS THE DISCOVERY DISPUTE AND THE OPPOSING SIDES AS WELL YOU YOU CAN'T A CERTAINLY TAKEN REASONABLE EFFORTS TO KEEP THIS SECRET. YOU IN FACT GAVE THIS TO PUBLIC ENTITY WHICH BY STATUTE WHICH REQUIRED TO GIVE IT OUT. SO FIRST WE JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHTS THE HASN'T DISCUSSED WE SEE THE APPLICATION GOING FAR BEYOND JUST THE PUBLIC RECORDS ACT HERE AND EVEN AFTER THE CITY NO LONGER HAS A DOCUMENT -- ALSO WE SEE THIS GOING BEYOND THE CONTRACTING ELEMENT -- IT'S BEEN DISCUSSED ON CONTRACTING BUT WE JUST LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THIS LANGUAGE AS WE READ IT. GOES INTO ALSO SO IT'S A TAX INCENTIVE TO PULL BUSINESSES TO CALIFORNIA -- FOR LET'S SEE IF YOU'RE GOING TO APPLY FOR A WAIVER OF SOME SPECIFIC REGULATORY REQUIREMENT YOU WILL SUBMIT DOCUMENTS NOT RESPECT. SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOUT A RACING THAT WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE COMPANY THAT THAT BIDS FOR BIG CONTRACTING GETS IT. MOREOVER WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING WITH THE COMPANY THAT THAT GETS THE CONTRACT ANOTHER IMPORTANT EL ELEMENT IS THIS FORCES BUSINESSES TO MAKE A DECISION BEFORE THEY APPLY FOR THE CONTRACT OR FOR ANY -- ANY INCENTIVE DO I WANT TO WAIVE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION A CALL CALIFORNIA PUBLIC RECORDS ACT AND I'M GOING FORWARD IN THESE DOCUMENTS -- PERIOD FOR THE CHANCE AT THAT CONTRACT WHICH I MAY NOT GET. OR WOULD LIKE TO MAINTAIN THE POTENTIAL THE SORTING TRADE SECRET PROTECTION GOING FORWARD. AND WE BELIEVE THAT DICHOTOMY THAT CHOICE FOR BUSINESSES IT'S IS NOT GOOD FOR PROCUREMENT CALIFORNIA AND IS NOT -- IT'S NOT GOOD FOR THE BUSINESSES OR CALIFORNIA -- FINALLY -- I'D LIKE TO BRIEFLY ADDRESS A A PRIVACY CONCERNS. WE APPRECIATE THE I'M THE LANGUAGE WHICH I BELIEVE IS NOW IN THE BILL I RELATED -- TO KEEPING OUT -- IDENTIFYING INFORMATION WE STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS OF THIS FORCES PUBLIC ENTITIES TO GIVE OUT A RANGE OF INFORMATION WHICH YES WE ALL KNOW EVEN WITHOUT THE NAME. IDENTIFYING INFORMATION CAN STILL BE CONTENT SO WE HAVE CONCERNS THERE WHICH I'M SURE THE AUTHOR IS HAPPY DO YOU KNOW ADDRESSES THAT'S I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE THE CORE. GOAL OF THE BILL -- AND IT TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE COMMENTS BRIEFLY AND I'LL BE DONE -- AS TO THE SECOND NGUYEN IS HIS NAME I THINK YOU STEP DOWN I'M SORRY I DON'T RECALL YOUR NAME -- THERE'S A CUT MADE ABOUT THE BIDDING PROCESS AND WOW THIS WAYS IN HERE. AS FAR AS WE CAN TELL THAT THAT COMMENTS KIND OF OFF BASE RIGHT IN THE BIDDING PROCESS THE THE PUBLIC ENTITY HAS THIS INFORMATION THEY CAN CONSIDER IT. RIGHT THE ISSUE ISN'T WHETHER THEY GET AT THE ISSUES WITH A THIRD PARTY OUR COMPETITORS GET IT AND THAT'S WHERE OUR CONCERN COMES FROM -- AND WITH THAT THAT'S THE REASONS FOR OPPOSITION AND TAKE YOUR TIME. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU COULD JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLACE. MAURICE RISEN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HOUSE WITH ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. DROUGHT COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WERE POST. AMY BLOOMBERG ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES IN OPPOSITION. CAME TO ME TO A TECHNICIAN IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SIGNAL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS [inaudible] RIGHT. THIS FEATURE NORRIS. GOOD MORNING AB SO I IS MANY I CHAIR THE ASSEMBLIES ACCOUNTABILITY COMMITTEE. AND I I SHE EIGHT TO YOUR EFFORT TEN IMPROVE INCREASE TRANSPARENCY TO ENSURE THAT. TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING SPENT EFFICIENTLY AND EFFECTIVELY. IF YOU HAVE TO QUESTION SO THE FIRST IS IF YOU CAN JUST RESPOND TO THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN. THIS WOULD VIOLATE. AND AND EMPLOYEES CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY [inaudible] OKAY. TWO ONE YEAH RIGHT RIGHT AND THEN ALL OF THE POOREST I MEAN I THINK -- OPPOSITION AND STATED THAT YOU KNOW WE'VE INCLUDED A CLARIFYING AMENDMENT AND OBVIOUSLY THAT'S NOT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL -- I DON'T BELIEVE -- THAT THE CONCERN THAT THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE POTENTIALLY IDENTIFYING INFORMATION SUBJECT -- TO SUCH REQUEST IS A VALID CONCERN -- ALL PERSONAL IDENTIFYING WITHIN THE SCOPE OF WHAT IS BEING EXEMPTED FROM -- THIS TRADE SECRET EXEMPTION ARE WHAT IS BEING -- NOT INCLUDED WITHIN THE TRADE SECRET EXEMPTION. AND I'LL JUST ADD THAT WHAT WE'RE SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR IS INFORMATION ABOUT THE NUMBER OF JOBS THE OCCUPATIONS THE WAGES. BENEFITS -- IT'S NOT ABOUT INDIVIDUAL. EMPLOYEES AND WHO THEY ARE AND WHAT THEY ARE AT CLARK TAKE IT'S ABOUT THE TOTAL. BECAUSE THAT'S IN FACT WHAT PUBLIC CONTRACTS TALK ABOUT IS HOW MANY DOBBY GOING TO BE CREATED WE SEE THAT ALL THE TIME RIGHT SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT OKAY SUIT. I'M. THE AMENDMENTS THAT YOU'VE INCORPORATED ADDRESS ADDRESS ADDRESS THAT CONCERN OKAY AND THEN I THINK THE ANOTHER CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED IS THAT -- DISCOVER THIS WOULD GO BEYOND. COMPANIES THAT ARE ENGAGED IN CONTRACTS AND INCLUDE THINGS LIKE -- LIKE CAL COMPETES AND AND THOSE SORTS OF PROGRAMS -- IS IS IS THAT AND AN ACCURATE CONCERN AND YOUR HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO TO THAT CONCERN IN TERMS OF OF THE BROADENING OF THE SCOPE. WHAT YOU WOULD DO THAT MEASURE AND WHY WOULD NOT SAY THAT THAT IS A CONCERN? I THINK -- WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A VERY LIMITED CATEGORY OF DOCUMENTS MORE TALK ABOUT DOCUMENTS THAT ARE ALREADY DISPOSABLE UNDER THE CPR IT? BUT WHEN WE WHAT WERE WHAT WERE EXPLICITLY INCLUDING IN THIS BILL. I WHEN THERE ARE PROMISES BEING MADE IN EXCHANGE FOR SUBSIDIES IN EXCHANGE FOR CONTRACTS. WHERE IN EXCHANGE FOR THE MONEY THAT WE ARE GIVING TO CONTRACTORS THEY SAY WE'RE GOING TO CREATE THIS NUMBER OF JOBS WERE GOING TO PROVIDE A LIVING WAGE JOBS WERE IN PROVIDE THESE BENEFITS -- THAT'S WHEN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THOSE PROMISES -- I I THINK THAT IF WE ARE GIVING OUT TREMENDOUSLY -- YOU KNOW TREMENDOUS I SIZE SUBSIDIES. IN EXCHANGE FOR PROMISES THOSE PROMISES SHOULD BE ENFORCEABLE. SO JUST TO ADD TO THAT -- NOTHING IN THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC AGENCIES TO OBTAIN RECORDS THAT ARE NOT WITHIN THEIR ACTUAL OR CONSTRUCTIVE POSSESSION -- THAT'S REALLY CLEAR AS WELL SO WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO GET. ANY THIRD PARTY RECORDS JUST WHAT'S IN THAT AGENCIES POSSESSION AND CONTROL RIGHT AND FOR THE PURPOSE OF INSURING TO YOUR POINT THAT THE THE PROMISES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE. NOT TO US BUT TO CALIFORNIA TAXPAYERS. CAN I SAY YOU KNOW THESE ARE DOCUMENTS THAT OFTENTIMES THE CONTRACTOR SAYS HOW MUCH IS THE PROJECT AT A COST HOW MUCH ARE YOU GONNA BE PAID FOR RIGHT. WHEN WE ARE CONTRACTING TO EXPLICITLY INCLUDE PROMISES THE GO BEYOND THAT? THOSE PROMISES ARE WHAT SHOULD BE DISCLOSED. AND IT'S REALLY A PRETTY FINITE SMALL A NUMBER OF SCENARIOS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IT'S AN EXCHANGE FOR THESE TAX DOLLARS THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO THESE RECORDS. THANK YOU AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING ABOUT TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FOR THIS IS LONG BEEN A CONCERN IF WE ARE. IN FACT GIVING. TAX BENEFIT OR OTHERS NOT GETTING THE INFORMATION BACK TO BE ABLE TO JUSTIFY THAT IS IS CERTAINLY A A FRUSTRATION AND AND AND IT'S A LITTLE BIT INTERESTING OF AN ARGUMENT BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS SOMETHING IS NOT A TRADE SECRET. BUT THEN FOR A COMPANY TO WANT TO ASSERT THAT AS A TRADE SECRET LATER ON IS TO ME A BIT SPEECHES SO THAT ARGUMENT ABOUT THE EXTENSION. REALLY JUST DOES NOT HOLD ANY WATER AND I THINK THAT'S JUST A AT AN ATTEMPT TO OBFUSCATE HERE A LITTLE BIT. SO I APPRECIATE DID YOU BRING IN THIS FORD I THINK IT'S OF A VERY. GOOD ISSUE AND SOMETHING THAT THAT THAT THE PUBLIC HAS A RIGHT TO KNOW WHEN COMPANIES ARE GETTING THE THE BENEFIT OF OUR TAX STRUCTURE AS WE ARE WANT TO DO. WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION I FEEL TO THOSE PUBLIC TAXPAYERS TO BE ABLE TO ARTICULATE THE BENEFITS THIS IS A TOOL TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION. THANK YOU. FOR THAT YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU AND AND REALLY THIS IS ALSO ABOUT THE MANY MANY COMPANIES. THAT DO HAVE PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE THEY HAVE NOTHING TO HIDE BECAUSE THEY ARE COMING THROUGH. AND LIVING UP TO THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN SO WE EXPECT THAT IN AND THEY'RE DOING IT IN A REALLY POSITIVE CONSTRUCTIVE WAY. IT'S WOULD BE CHAIN FULL OF OTHERS WERE NOT REQUIRED OF OF TO LIVE UP TO THE SAME. END OF THEIR BARGAIN SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK THE I BOOK THANK YOU THANK YOU I'M STILL LOOKING FOR MOTION MOTIONS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS.

TWENTY NINETEEN MEMBERS YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA HAS LONG BEEN A WELCOMING HOME FOR REFUGEES RESETTLED INTO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IS A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT INVOLVING THE FEDERAL STATE COUNTY AND NONPROFIT ENTITIES -- SO IT IS OF UTMOST IMPORTANCE THAT EVERYONE COMES A TABLE AND WORKS TOGETHER IN A UNITED FRONT. HOWEVER AS YOU ALL WELL KNOW THIS IS NOT BEEN THE CASE IN THE FEDERAL LEVEL IN RECENT YEARS -- THE CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAS DRASTICALLY CUT THE NATION'S REFUGEE ARRIVALS AND EFFECTIVELY ELIMINATED ALMOST HALF OF THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT SPOTS IN THE WORLD. THE UNITED STATES IS WELCOME FEWER THAN ELEVEN THOUSAND REFUGEES SO FAR THIS YEAR NEAR NEARLY HALFWAY THROUGH THE YEAR -- AT THIS RATE THE ADMINISTRATION WILL COME NOWHERE NEAR WE SETTLE IN ITS THIRTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUAL GOAL A GOAL WHICH PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE HISTORIC AVERAGE COMMITMENT OF THIS NATION OF NINETY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES. ANNUALLY CONGRESS AND THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO CONTINUE TO STAND BY THIS INCREDIBLY VALUABLE POPULATION AND AS THEY HAVE DONE IN THE PAST WITH ME TODAY IN ORDER IN TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS KATE CHIANG -- AND DINA BOSSA THAT BOSTON SEC. IN THE IN THE VICINITY I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT THE INTERNATIONAL REFUGEE AHEAD INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. ALRIGHT GOOD MORNING EVERYONE HI MY NAME IS KATE CHIANG AND I AM AN ADVOCATE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. I AM HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THE ASSEMBLY JOINT RESOLUTION NINETEEN ON REFUGEES. THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE IS A REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT AGENCY. WITH SEVEN OFFICES ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND MANY MORE NATIONALLY. WE HAVE WORKED HERE PROVIDING RESETTLEMENT SERVICES FOR NEARLY FOUR DECADES. OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THINGS LIKE CULTURAL ORIENTATION HOUSING ENGLISH LANGUAGE EDUCATION JOB PLACEMENT AND MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. THROUGHOUT THAT TIME LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE WELCOME NEWLY ARRIVED REFUGEES AND WE HAVE SEEN THOUSANDS OF CLIENTS REBUILD THEIR LIVES TO BECOME INVESTED AN INTEGRAL MEMBERS OF THEIR NEW COMMUNITIES. AS WAS ALREADY MENTIONED HISTORICALLY THE REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT OUR NUMBERS HAVE ENJOYED BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH AN ANNUAL AVERAGE OF MORE THAN NINETY FIVE THOUSAND REFUGEES RESETTLED EACH YEAR IN FACT THE HIGHEST NUMBER. WAS UNDER PRESIDENT REAGAN. BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE ANYMORE. AS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION HAS HALTED REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND SUBSEQUENTLY SLASH ARRIVAL NUMBERS FOR REFUGEES -- THROUGH TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY NINETEEN WE'RE NOT EVEN ON TRACK TO MEET THE NUMBER SET BY THE PRESIDENTIAL DETERMINATION NUMBER [inaudible] HEARING CALIFORNIA. THAT HAS RESULTED IN A QUEUE CONSEQUENCES BOTH FOR RESETTLEMENT AGENCIES AND THE COMMUNITIES BEING SERVED. A NUMBER OF OFFICES HAVE BEEN FORCED TO CLOSE LAYOFFS HAS RESULTED IN PROGRAMS THAT ARE MEANT TO CONTINUE TO ASSIST REFUGEES FOUR FIVE UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER THEIR ARRIVAL. ARE NO LONGER BEING ABLE TO BE OFFERED IN CERTAIN PLACES. BUT WE ARE NOT WITHOUT HOPE THIS STATE HAS BEEN A NATIONAL LEADER IN SUPPORTING REFUGEES. PASSING LEGISLATION TO EASE ACCESS TO HIGHER EDUCATION. IMPROVING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND PROVIDING FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS WITH LARGE NUMBERS OF REFUGEE CHILDREN. AJ ARE NINETEEN IS ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE STATE'S CONSISTENT STRONG AND IMPORTANT LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE IN THE COUNTRY. WE THANK YOU FOR THAT AND WE GLADLY EXTEND OUR SUPPORT FOR THIS RESOLUTION. THANK YOU. THAT'S WHAT THE SWISS. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE GOOD MORNING. MY NAME IS THE NUMBER STAND SICK AND I AM A REFUGEE VOICE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TODAY TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AJ ARE AND NINETEEN REFUGEES A RESOLUTION THAT DOES NOT ONLY JUST EXTEND WELCOME AND SUPPORT FOR REFUGEES WAS SETTLED HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ALSO CALLS ON THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCREASE THE NUMBERS OF REFUGEES RESETTLED IN THE UNITED STATES. I CAME AS A REFUGEE FROM BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA IN. NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT AND FROM THE VERY FIRST MOMENT I BECAME A MEMBER OF THE SOCIETY. FROM THE VERY FIRST DAY I FELT ACCEPTED SUPPORT IT AND WELCOME. I STARTED WORKING IMMEDIATELY. I HAVE NEVER BEEN A BURDEN TO THE SOCIETY I STARTED WORKING FOR THE INTERNATIONAL RESCUE COMMITTEE. AND I STARTED HELPING THOSE IN NEED [inaudible] SO -- THAT'S WELCOME WAS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I CAN NOT REALLY SEE HAPPENING TODAY. BUT I STILL VIVIDLY REMEMBER THE DAY THAT I IS KATE I WAS FORCED TO ESCAPE. I WAS FORCED TO ESCAPE ON THE DAY WHEN -- WOMEN AND YOUNG GIRLS WERE TAKEN TO THE CONCENTRATION CAMP. SO I WAS ONE OF THE LUCKY ONES TO ESCAPE. AND WE NEED TO REMEMBER THAT REFUGEES DO NOT COME HERE OR DO NOT LEAVE THEIR HOMES BY CHOICE. REFUGEES ARE PEOPLE FLEEING PERSECUTION AND MORE. UNFORTUNATELY THE NEED FOR REFUGEE RESETTLEMENT HAS NOT DECREASED THE UNITED STATES HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN A LEADER. IN RESETTLING REFUGEES AND INVITING REFUGEES AND TO LOCAL COMMUNITIES. WHERE WE HAVE ALWAYS FELT SUPPORTED AND WELCOME? AND IT IS IMPORTANT THAT THE UNITED STATES RETURNS TO ITS ROLE AS A LEADER AND PROTECTING THE WORLD'S MOST VULNERABLE. INCLUDING WOMEN AND CHILDREN. CALIFORNIA IS NOT WALKING AWAY FROM THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE SUPPORT TO REFUGEES AND TO BE ONE OF THE LEADERS HERE IN THE UNITED STATES. THAT I'M REALLY THANKFUL AND GRATEFUL FOR AND TODAY I THANK YOU FOR THE CHANCE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION. AND TO ASK OTHER MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATOR TO EXPAND THEIR SUPPORT TO AJ ARE NINETEEN REFUGEES THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. STEVE GORMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA CIVIL LIBERTIES ADVOCACY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. RIGHT SIGNAL IS THEIR OPPOSITION. SEE NOT BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS WAS KALRA. THANK YOU CHIRLA THANK SOME ROAD WARRIOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THE REALITY IS OUR NATION. TYPICALLY TRADITIONALLY HAS AS WELCOME REFUGEES. DURING OUR HISTORY UNFORTUNATELY WE'RE THE MOMENT IN TIME WITH THAT A DOESN'T NECESSARILY SEEM TO BE THE CASE -- BUT AT A NATIONAL LEVEL AT TIMES BUT CALIFORNIA MUST ALWAYS -- CONTINUE TO BE WELCOMING TO REFUGEES AND MUST LEAD -- BOTH MORALLY -- BUT ALSO THROUGH OUR ACTIONS NOTHING THIS RESOLUTION MAKES IT VERY CLEAR THAT WE WILL CONTINUE. TO BE A WELCOMING COMMUNITY IN A LOVING COMMUNITY AND I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS THE THE WITNESSES FOR MAKING PRETTY CLEAR THAT -- THAT WILL CONTINUE TO STAND BY OUR VALUES AND WITH THAT I'D LIKE TO MOVE THE BILL WITH A RESOLUTION. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ON THE RESOLUTION OTHER COMMENTS QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT SEEING NONE SOBRE MEMORY MAY CLOSE JUST WOULD LIKE THE FAMOUS JAMES PAST TENSE LIKE -- FOR BEING HERE AND I WANT TO THINK I WANTED KNOWLEDGE OF THIS LEGISLATION SPONSORED BY A PET LEGISLATIVE CAUCUS IT HAS THE ENDORSEMENT OF ALL OF OUR AT THE CAUCUSES IN THE LEGISLATURE. SEC BASS PRIVATE [inaudible] THANK YOU. WE DO HAVE A MOTION A SECOND THE MOTION IS THAT THE RESOLUTION BE ADOPTED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE CHOW. CHOW I CHU. CHU AYE CAPER. GABRIEL I HOLDEN. HOLDEN AYE KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY [inaudible] MAIENSCHEIN [inaudible] OBERNOLTE [inaudible] PETRIE-NORRIS. I REYES. REYES AYE. THE BILL IS ADOPTED THANK YOU FOR THE RESOLUTION IS ADOPTED. SO OUR FINAL ITEM OF BUSINESS MR UMBERG ITEM NUMBER THREE SB. SEVENTEEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS THE MORNING. THANK YOU IN PARTICULAR OF COURSE THIS BILL WAS NEAR PERFECT WHEN IT CAME OUT OF THE SENATE BUT IT WAS MADE PERFECT BY YOUR STAFF -- JUST THE MEGA NATHAN. REALLY DIDN'T EXCELLENT JOB OF IMPROVING THE BILL AND LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE ISSUE IS AND THEN WHAT OUR EFFORT IS TO HELP MITIGATE THE ISSUE -- CURRENTLY IN CIVIL LITIGATION. THERE'S A PROCESS I THINK MANY OF YOU ARE AWARE THAT WAY WHERE YOU GATHER INFORMATION YOU GATHER INFORMATION THROUGH SEVERAL DIFFERENT TOOLS TO INTERROGATORIES REQUESTS FOR ADMISSIONS. AND ALSO THROUGH WERE FOR REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS IT IS MY EXPERIENCE THAT THE MOST. USEFUL OF THOSE TOOLS IS OBTAINING THE DOCUMENTS THAT CASES CAN'T BE CERTAINLY CAN'T BE TRIED BUT CAN'T EVEN REALLY BE SETTLED INTO YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION AND TODAY MOST THAT SOME DOCUMENTARY FORM. WITH ITS EMAILS OR DATA OR CORRESPONDENCE WHATEVER IT MAY BE -- SADLY THE DISCOVERY PROCESS IS NOW BEEN AN EXERCISE. MANY TIMES IN GAMESMANSHIP. IN THAT EXERCISE HAS BECOME INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE AN INCREDIBLY TIME CONSUMING IN OUR OWN COUNTY OF ORANGE IT CAN BE AND THIS THIS IS. RELATIVELY ROUTINE FOURTEEN MONTHS FROM THE DAY YOU ACTUALLY REQUEST DOCUMENTS TO THE DAY YOU GET TO A MOTION TO COMPEL SHOULD YOU NEED TO FILE WHAT WHICH IS NOT UNCOMMON. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT DOES TWO THINGS -- ONE I'VE TAKEN THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE RULE TWENTY SIX THE FEDERAL RULES OF CIVIL PROCEDURE AND AND TAKEN. UP SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE FEDERAL RULES AND THE CORP THEM STATE LAW THEY DO NOT BECOME EFFECTIVE UNLESS BOTH PARTIES STIPULATE TO THE MECHANISM AND STIPULATE TO THE REQUIREMENTS. THAT ARE CONTAINED IN THE BILL IN THOSE REQUIREMENTS. ARE SUCH THAT YOU ENGAGED EARLY ON IN COOPERATIVE DISCOVER YOU IDENTIFY WITNESSES YOU IDENTIFY DOCUMENTS TO IDENTIFY INSURANCE POLICIES YOU IDENTIFY A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT GET THE BALL ROLLING SO YOU CAN. GET THE CASE SETTLED THAT'S THE THAT'S THE PORTION OF THE BILL THAT COMES FROM THE FEDERAL RULES OF CRIMINAL EXCUSE ME CIVIL PROCEDURE. TWENTY SIX THE SECOND PART OF THE BILL DEALS WITH. ISSUES WHERE ATTORNEYS ROUTINELY FOR EXAMPLE FILE OBJECTIONS TO REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS WITHOUT REALLY THINKING THROUGH THEY JUST FOLLOW BLANKET OBJECTION. THE OTHER SIDE THAT HAS TO MEET AND FOR THAT PROCESS MAY SEEM SIMPLE BUT IT IS NOT IT CAN TAKE QUITE A LONG TIME. TO GET THE PARTIES TOGETHER IN IT INVITES AGAIN INVITES GAMESMANSHIP AND THEN IN SOME COUNTIES NO YOU HAVE TO GO THROUGH AN INFORMAL DISCOVERY PROCESS. WHICH FURTHER DELAYS BEFORE YOU CAN GET TO THE ACTUAL MOTION TO COMPEL AND THEN YOU CALL TO GET ON THE CALENDAR FOR THE MOTION COMPOUND THAT CAN BE. FOR EXAMPLE LOS ANGELES COUNTY -- YOU CAN BE SIX MONTHS IN ORANGE COUNTY COULD BE FOR MONTHS. AND SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SAYS TO THE COURT THAT WHEN YOU OBSERVE THIS GAMESMANSHIP WHEN YOU OBSERVE FOLKS FILING OBJECTIONS NOT IN GOOD FAITH WHEN YOU SEE FOLKS WERE NOT MEETING GOOD FAITH. WHEN YOU SEE PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT BASICALLY COOPERATING -- IN THE PROCESS AS IT WAS DESIGNED THEN YOU WERE REQUIRED TO SANCTION. AND AND THE SANCTION IS IN ADDITION TO REASONABLE TOURNEY'S FEES IF THE COURT SHOULD SO ORDER. BUT IT PROVIDES FOR THOUSAND DOLLARS SANCTION ALSO -- PROVIDES FOR AN ESCAPE VALVE. SHOULD THE ISSUE BE LITIGATED IN GOOD FAITH SO FOR EXAMPLE ISSUES OVER -- OVER PRIVILEGE THE THERE ARE THERE ARE LEGIT WELL LITTLE GERMAN ISSUES OVER MANY THINGS BUT BUT ARGUMENTS OVER PRIVILEGE CAN BECOME DIFFICULT. AND IN GOOD FAITH THEY CAN LEAD TO GET IT THE COURT FINDS THAT THAT ITS LITIGATING GOOD FAITH THAT THE COURT CAN EXCUSE THOSE SANCTIONS -- I AM A OF PLEASED TO HAVE HAD TIME WITH THEM MANY MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND A AND I WOULD APPRECIATE MY VOTE. THANK YOU AND THERE ARE AMENDMENTS LISTED ON PAGE ELEVEN AND TWELVE DOESN'T ACCEPT THOSE MOMENTS ARE ACCEPTING THEM THANK YOU. RIGHT FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING NANCY TRAVEL WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA. WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE WORKING WITH SENATOR -- BURKE ON THIS BILL IN ALL MY YEARS IN THE CAPITAL I HAVE NEVER SEEN SUCH ENTHUSIASM AND PASSION FOR CIVIL PROCEDURE. AND FOR THOSE ABOUT HIM YEAH FOR THOSE OF US WHO WENT TO WHAT LAW SCHOOL IT IS -- IT'S ACTUALLY PRETTY FUN TO SEE ED AND THERE WILL BE ANOTHER CIVIL PROCEDURE BILL THAT SENATOR I'M BURKE IS BRING YOU THIS STICK COMMITTEE AND JUST TWO WEEKS THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING JOINTLY ON WITH DEFENSE COUNSEL BUT GOING INTO THIS BILL -- WE DO THINK -- IT IS IMPORTANT TO YOU HAVE MORE TEETH IN SANCTIONS TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ABSOLUTELY OUTRAGEOUS ABUSES THAT OCCURRED DURING DISCOVERY AND THE DELAYS. AND AS FAR AS THE OTHER PART OF THE BILL ON THE EARLY EXCHANGE OF DOCUMENTS -- JUST LIKE SENATOR -- BURKE IS PASSIONATE ABOUT CIVIL PROCEDURE MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE ALSO PASSIONATE -- AND THEY ARE THEY WERE CONCERNED ABOUT HAVING A MAJOR CHANGE AND HOW. DOCUMENTS ARE EXCHANGE IN DISCOVERY SO WE APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THIS NEW PROCEDURE ON USED BY STIPULATION AND WE WILL ALL BE ABLE TO SEE. HOW IT WORKS AND HOW MANY DO STIPULATE AND USE THE EARLY EXCHANGE OF DOCUMENTS -- WE HOPE IS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD THERE ALSO CAN. BE A REPORTER SOME DATA COLLECTION ON HOW OFTEN THERE IS A STIPULATION AND HOW MANY PEOPLE CHOOSE TO USE THIS PROCEDURE AS THEY GO THROUGH THEIR CASES THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SEE NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN STONE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BOBBY LEVY AND I'M HERE TODAY AS LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CERTIFIED FAMILY LAW SPECIALIST. ALSO NOTICE A CFL US. A FEARFUL OF THE POSES THE BILL FOR ALL THE REASONS SET FORTH IN OUR FIVE PAGE DETAILED OPPOSITION LETTER HOWEVER AS FOR SECTION. ONE IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. MAKING THE REQUIREMENTS OF SECTION TWO OH ONE SIX POINT. OH NINE OH ONLY APPLY BY STIPULATION OF ALL THE PARTIES TO THE ACTION. IN THAT CASE ACR PHYLLIS WOULD REMOVE ITS OPPOSITION TO SECTION. ONE HOWEVER IT'S THE APPLE EIGHTY UP BELIEVE THAT SECTION TO SELL A PROBLEM. IN THAT IT CREATES A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN ATTORNEY AND CLIENT. ATTORNEYS DON'T HAVE A DOG. IN THE FIGHT BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ESPECIALLY IN FAMILY LAW MANY FAMILY LAW CLIENTS EITHER IGNORE. HARD TO BELIEVE IGNORE ATTORNEY DIRECTIVES TO PRODUCE DOCUMENTS SOME FAMILY LAW CLIENTS ARE NOT GREAT RECORD KEEPERS SOME FAMILY LOCK CLIENTS SIMPLY DON'T WANT TO COOPERATE. SOME FAMILY LAW CLIENTS JUST HAVE TROUBLE GETTING THE INFORMATION -- AND NOT PUTS THE ATTORNEYS IN A IN A POSITION WHERE THEY'RE EITHER FORCED TO WITHDRAW FROM THE CASE BECAUSE THERE NOW. SUBJECT TO POSSIBLE SANCTIONS THAT ARE REPORTABLE TO THE STATE BAR -- AND AND THEY'RE ALREADY SANCTIONS IN DISCOVERY -- THE ANALYSIS -- THAT IS THE MOST RECENT ANALYSIS FOR THE COMMITTEE -- FAILS TO OR MINUTES TO ADDRESS SEVERAL SANCTION PROVISIONS ALREADY IN THE C. C. P.. SPECIFICALLY TWENTY TWENTY THREE POINT OH THREO A COURT MAY IMPOSE MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST ATTORNEY OR CLIENT. FOR ENGAGING IN MISUSE OF THE DISCOVERY PROCESS -- TWENTY THIRTY POINT THREE HUNDRED THE COURT SHALL IMPOSE MONETARY SANCTIONS AGAINST PARTY OR ATTORNEY WHO UNSUCCESSFULLY OPPOSES. A MOTION TO COMPEL WITH REGARDS TO FORM INTERROGATORIES AND THEN C. C. P. -- TO THREE ONE POINT THREE HUNDRED IS ALSO A SHALL PROVISION ON SANCTIONS WITH RESPECT TO A DEMAND FOR PRODUCTION AND THEN IN TERMS OF FAMILY LAW WE HAVE FAMILY CODE -- TWENTY TO SEVENTY ONE AND FAMILY CO TWO SEVENTY ONE IS ONE OF THE MOST POWERFUL CODE SECTIONS IN CALIFORNIA FAMILY LAW. ALLOWS FOR SANCTIONS WHEN A FAMILY LAW LITIGANT OR HIS OR HER ATTORNEY. VIOLATES THE POLICY OF A LOT OF PROMOTE SETTLEMENT OF LITIGATION AND WHERE POSSIBLE TO REDUCE THE COST OF LITIGATION BY ENCOURAGING COOPERATION BETWEEN THE PARTIES. AND THE ATTORNEYS WE BELIEVE THAT SANCTIONING HEARINGS WILL PET ATTORNEY AGAINST CLIENT -- IN THAT HOW DO IT HOW'S THE ATTORNEY GOING TO DEFEND HIM OR HERSELF AGAINST A POSSIBLE SANCTION THAT IS NOW REPORTABLE AGAINST THE STATE BAR. AS A PRACTITIONER I WOULD PROBABLY HAVE TO DOCUMENT ALL MY EFFORTS TO GET THE DOCUMENTS FROM THAT CLIENTS. AND THEN WHEN IT COMES. TO A MOTION AGAINST ME FOR A THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT I WOULD HAVE TO REPORT. THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO HAVE TO COME OUT SO THAT I CAN DEFEND MYSELF AND THAT'S A VIOLATION OF ATTORNEY CLIENT PRIVILEGE SO IT'S REALLY A REALLY UNTENABLE SITUATION IN TERMS OF ALLOWING THE SANCTIONS TO BE IMPOSED ON AN ATTORNEY THAT IS REPORTABLE. ON LIKE ALL THE OTHER DISCOVERY SANCTIONS WHICH ARE NOT -- AND FOR THOSE REASONS IF YOU FLIP OPPOSES THE BILL. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. ALL RIGHT SAY NONE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. ZERO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IS CENTER I JUST WANTED TO BRING YOUTH THANK YOU FOR BRINGING FOR THE SPELL US AS SOMEONE PRACTICE CIVIL LITIGATION CALIFORNIA THINK ANYONE WHO HAS IN THE PAST. DECADE OR BEYOND UNDERSTANDS THAT OUR DISCOVERY PROCESS A SUBJECT TO RAMPANT ABUSE AND GAMESMANSHIP IN A WAY THAT -- NOT ONLY CREATE THIS WHOLE BODY OF COLLATERAL LITIGATION THAT TAKES AWAY FROM THE MERITS BUT IT -- IT REALLY UNDERMINES OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM IT TAKES THE FOCUS AWAY FROM WHERE IT SHOULD BE AND IT DRIVES UP THE COST TO FOLKS IN A WAY THAT'S REALLY UNNECESSARY SO -- I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRING YOUR FOR IT I THINK IT'S IT'S IMPORTANT I I I LIKE THE SUGGESTION OF OF DATA COLLECTION AND I HOPE THAT -- OF THE WE HAVE SOME JUDGES OUT THERE THAT ARE GONNA COURAGE FOLKS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE STIPULATION BECAUSE I THINK WILL BE A MUCH NEEDED CHANGE THE SYSTEM. THANK YOU [inaudible] ADDRESS. I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE HAVING PRACTICED LAW IT THE THE COMMENT THAT WAS MADE THE MOST TURNS DON'T HAVE A DOG IN THE FIGHT. THE GAME AND SHIP. SOME SOMEHOW ELEVATES EVERYBODY TO HAVE A DOG IN THE FIGHT WHICH IS UNFORTUNATE AND I THINK THAT -- A BILL SUCH AS THIS IS IMPORTANT TO LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD I HOPE THAT TO THE CONNECTED THE CONVERSATION CONTINUES THOUGH PERHAPS WITH FAMILY LINE NEVER PRACTICED IN FAMILY LAW. PERHAPS OR SOMETHING SPECIAL ABOUT FAMILY LAW THAT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERED HERE AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE YOU TO CONTINUE IN THE CONVERSATIONS YOU ALREADY HAVE BEEN HAVING. WITH THOSE PRACTICING FAMILY LAW BUT I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS KILEY. THANK YOU SENATOR ME A GOOD CONVERSATION ABOUT THIS BILL AND I MAD SUPPORTIVE OF MOST OF ITS RESIDENTS THE ONE QUESTION THAT I HAD WAS. THAT YOUR AT SORT OF ELEVATING. THE LEVEL OF SANCTION FOR THE ATTORNEY HIM OR HERSELF HEREBY MAKING IT REPORTABLE TO THE STATE BAR SO I JUST WANTED -- TO SEE. WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE WHAT THE IMPLICATIONS OF THAT ARE FOR THE ATTORNEY AND HOW THAT MIGHT AFFECT -- YOU KNOW THE KIND OF DURING THE DISCOVERY PROCESS. IT THANK YOU AS A MEMBER KILEY YET YOU RAISE THE QUESTION THAT'S A THAT'S AN EXCELLENT QUESTION WE RESEARCH DID AFTER OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY. SO THE BILL PROVIDES -- FOR DISCRETION FOR THE COURT TYPICALLY DISCOVERY SANCTIONS ARE NOT REPORTABLE STATE BAR IN THIS CASE THE COURT CAN FIND THAT THE ATTORNEY MUST REPORTED TO THE STATE BAR -- I WOULD EXPECT THAT THAT WOULD BE REPEATED REPEATED DISCOVERY ABUSE -- THE STATE BAR DOESN'T AUTOMATICALLY DISCIPLINE A MEMBER THOUGH SO EVEN IF IT'S REPORTED THERE'S A PROCESS THAT THE STATE BAR WHERE THEY REVIEW IT AND MAKE A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER IT'S WORTHY OF DISCIPLINE. AND ONLY IF IT'S WORTHY OF DISCIPLINE DOES IT GO SO FOR EXAMPLE IF IF ANY OF THE ATTORNEYS ON THE COMMITTEE OF EVER LOOKED AT THEIR OWN -- THEIR THEIR OWN DESIGNATION STATE BAR WEBSITE YOU'LL SEE THAT IT WILL SAY WHETHER TURNS BEEN DISCIPLINED OR NOT DISCIPLINED SO THERE IS ANOTHER PROCESS. BOB AFTER THE SANCTIONS ARE REPORTED TO DISCIPLINE THE ATTORNEY -- IT. SO THERE ARE PRESUMABLY BE I HAVE TO BE SOME FINDING BY THE BAR THERE WAS SOME SORT OF YOU KNOW INTENTIONAL ABUSE OF THE PROCESS IN ORDER FOR THAT TO BE. THAN VISIBLE ON THE HUNT IS RECORD EXACTLY OR REPEATED OR EXACTLY. GIVE OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. CENTER WE HAD LONG DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS SITE A PRESHEAF THAT IN WITH RESPECT TO FAMILY LAW I THINK THERE. THE THE BIGGEST CONCERN THAT I HAD I APPRECIATE YOU TAKE THE AMENDMENT OR THE NUMBER OF UNREPRESENTED LITIGANTS IN THE FAMILY LAW SYSTEM AND I AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THERE ARE CHALLENGES FOR AN AND REPRESENTED LITIGANTS REALLY UNDERSTAND. CIVIL PROCEDURE AND THE NUANCES THERE SO WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO BE CATCHING THEM UP IN THAT. AND AS THE HOUSES POINTS OUT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF SANCTIONS PROVISIOS THAT THE COURTS ARE GOING TO NEED TO HARMONIZE. BUT I THINK YOU'RE PUTTING. AND BECAUSE BOTH PARTIES ARE GONNA ESSENTIALLY NEED TO AGREE TO THIS. THIS WILL BE VERY INTERESTING EXPERIMENT TO SEE HOW THIS MOVES FORWARD AND CHANGES THAT DYNAMIC OF THE LEVEL OF GAMES THAT GET PLAYED. AS WE'RE IN AN ERA WHERE ACCESS TO JUSTICE IS CERTAINLY A CHALLENGE AND IN THE CIVIL SIDE SO MANY. CASES ARE NOT GOING ON ON TIMELY MATTERS IN OF BIRTH IN FRONT OF JUDGE AS ANY EXACERBATIONS OF THAT AND ESPECIALLY EXACERBATIONS THAT TEND TO BE MORE OF GAME PLAYING THAT NOT. I THINK WE DO NEED TO TAKE SERIOUSLY SO I APPRECIATE YOU BEING WILLING TO WAITED TO CIVIL PROCEDURE. AND AND REALLY LOOK AT HOW THE COURTS. AND PARTIES ARE PROCESSING AND MOVING THROUGH THAT THROUGH THEIR LITIGATION PROCESS SO. I APPRECIATE YOU MOVING FORWARD AND WITH THAT. YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND LET ME. REPEAT REITERATE THAT THAT YOUR STAFF HAS MADE THIS BILL MUCH MUCH BETTER -- TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER GABRIEL'S COMMON I DO HOPE THE JUDGES THAT ENCOURAGE PARTIES TO STIPULATE SO THAT WE CAN SEE. WHETHER THIS IS AFFECTED BUT I I BELIEVE FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE COURSES NOTHING MORE DANGEROUS EXPERIENCE. THAT THAT DISCOVERY DOES WORK MUCH BETTER THE FEDERAL COURTS THAN IT DOES IN THE STATE COURTS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS AND AND PERHAPS PART OF IT IS REAL -- TWENTY SIX CONCERNING THE THE FAMILY LAW PRACTITIONERS CONCERNS LUCKILY I'VE NEVER HAD LONG COOPERATIVE CLIENT -- ACTUALLY THAT'S NOT TRUE BOB I'VE HAD MANY UNCOOPERATIVE CLIENTS IT AND THAT. YOU KNOW I I I UNDERSTAND I UNDERSTAND THAT POINT -- AND AT SOME POINT IT DOES BECOME THE OBLIGATION ATTORNEY IF THE CLIENT SIMPLY SAYS I'M NOT GOING TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW I'M JUST NOT GOING TO DO IT THEN THEN THE ATTORNEYDOESN'T HAVE A CHOICE. BUT TO EITHER WITHDRAW OR TO CONVINCE THE CLIENT THAT THEY HAVE TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW THAT'S SIMPLY HOW THE SYSTEM WORKS -- I I WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION -- AND I DO REALIZE THAT THINGS ARE A BIT DIFFERENT AND CERTAINLY -- AS THE CHAIR SUGGESTED WITH THOSE WHO ARE PRO PER IN FAMILY LAW COURT. THAT THERE SHOULD BE SOME CONSIDERATION FOR THEIR IN EXPERIENCE IN THE LAW -- WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU I AM STILL LOOKING FOR MOTION MOTION V.
