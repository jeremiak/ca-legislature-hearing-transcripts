ALSO REYES DISEASE IS GROWING PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS ACCORDING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ZACKS IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO ALZHEIMER'S INCREASED TWO HUNDRED AND 43% FROM TWO THOUSAND TO TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ALZHEIMER'S WAS THE THIRD LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. ACCORDING TO THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION LESS THAN HALF OF THE INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S HAVE BEEN GIVEN A DIAGNOSIS THE LACK OF A DIAGNOSIS LEADS TO A NUMBER OF CHALLENGES RELATED TO PLANNING CARE COST OF CARE AND ENGAGEMENT IN CLINICAL TRIALS. WHILE THE STATE HAS A GERIATRIC CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS AND HAS FUNDED THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOLS TO HELP PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS DIAGNOSE FOR ALZHEIMER'S IT CHALLENGES IN RECEIVING A TIMELY AND ACCURATE ACCURATE DIAGNOSIS CONTINUE TO PERSIST. FOR EXAMPLE ANY SURE MY SURVEY CONDUCTED BY THE ALZHEIMER'S ASSOCIATION REVEALED THAT PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS THE A GROWING ISSUE PRESENTED BY DEMENTIA AND FEEL UNPREPARED MORE THAN HALF SAY THEY ARE NOT THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH DEMENTIA CARE SPECIALIST IN THE AREA TO MEET PATIENT DEMAND AND NEARLY OR ONLY SOMETIMES COMFORTABLE MAKING THE DIAGNOSIS OF ALZHEIMER'S OR OTHER DEMENTIAS. SB EIGHT MORE IMPROVE THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIANS TO RECEIVE A DIGNIFIED DIAGNOSIS AND QUALITY CARE FOR ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA SPECIFICALLY SB FORTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE PROVIDERS TO COMPLETE AT LEAST FOUR HOURS OF CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION CME. ON ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA EVERY TWO YEARS. CALIFORNIA ONLY HAS FIVE HUNDRED AND NINETEEN GERIATRICS FOR SPECIALISTS TO CARE FOR THE FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION PEOPLE AGE SIXTY FIVE AND ABOVE. WE MUST ENSURE THAT ALL AFFABLE PROVIDERS OBTAIN THE NECESSARY TRAINING I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION IS COMMITTEE AND ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO ENSURE THAT THE CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS ARE BALANCED.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND SENATORS ARE INVOLVED WITH THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA FIRST ELECTED TO GIVE A CLEAR SIGN THAT THE BOARD HAS NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BILL HOWEVER DURING ITS LAST MEETING THE BOARD MEMBERS VOICED CERTAIN CONCERNS SENATE BILL FORTY EIGHT. PORT IS CONCERNED THAT PHYSICIANS SHOULD HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO CHOOSE CONTINUING EDUCATION MOST APPROPRIATE TO THEIR PRACTICE AND THAT MANDATING CERTAIN COURSEWORK BY STATUTE MAINLY TO FUTURE PRESSURES TO DO SO ON OTHER MATTERS AND POTENTIALLY CROWD OUT OTHER EDUCATIONAL NEEDS THE CONDITIONS FACED AS THEY SERVE THAT PARTICULAR PATIENT POPULATION. ON THIS TOPIC MISTER CHAIRMAN AS OF ALL OTHER AREAS OF PRACTICE THE BOARD EXPECTS LICENSEES TO ADHERE TO THE STANDARD OF CARE WHEN TREATING THEIR PATIENTS CONTINUING EDUCATION IS AN IMPORTANT PART TO ENSURE THE POSITION TO MAINTAIN THEIR CONFIDENCE. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE OFFICE OFFICE. OFFICER FOR THE POSITIVE DIALOGUE SO FAR THAT WE'VE HAD OVER THESE LAST WEEK AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUE-CONVERSATIONS. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU. NEXT. WHY. THIRTY EIGHT. GOOD MORNING MR CARE MEMBERS OPERATE DOUGHERTY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ACADEMY OF FAMILY PHYSICIANS. IT'S RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB FORTY EIGHT UNLESS IT'S AMENDED TO APPROPRIATELY RECOGNIZE THE THIRTY OF THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA SET EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND THE FLEXIBILITY POSITIONS NEED. AGENTS BENEFIT FROM THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION. WE CERTAINLY SHARE THE AUTHOR'S GOLDEN SHARING THAT PATIENTS SUFFERING FROM ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA RECEIVE APPROPRIATE AND TIMELY CARE BUT WE BELIEVE SB FORTY EIGHT ONE FORTUNATELY NOT THE CHEAPEST LAW INTENDED GOALS. CURRENTLY CRAFTING. REALLY MEDICAL EDUCATION CURRICULUM BE BY DEMONSTRATES CLINICAL AND READ NOT DICTATE BY STATE. FURTHERMORE POSITIONS COME. COURSE NEXUS TO BEST MEET THE NEEDOF THERE'S PATIENT PANEL BETTING AND- WELL EACH WITH TEN IS THERE A- TO THEIR PATIENTS. THE MOST APPROPRIATE AT TO DETERMINE THE OVERALL POSITION EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS IT IS ABOUT QUARTER CALIFORNIA AT SUCH CITY AREA HE ASKED THAT. QUESTION. TWENTY ONE NINETY FOUR.

CONTINUING REQUIREMENTS BOARD SHALL CONSIDER INCLUDING A COURSE ON THE SPECIAL CARE NEEDS OF PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA. LOS OF MY MINUTES ALSO CAN WITH BUSINESS PERFECT CODE SECTIONS ONE NINE ONE FIVE WHICH ALSO GIVES MEDICAL DISCRETION IN DETERMINING AND CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. FOR INTEGRATING MENTAL AND PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS ESPECIALLY AS IT PERTAINS TO EARLY IDENTIFICATION OF MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND EXPOSURE TO TRAUMA IN CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS- MORE CALIFORNIA'S RECENTLY RELEASED MASTER PLAN FOR AGING STATES THAT. ONLY ABOUT 5% OF PROVIDERS IN GENERAL. AFTER TRADING INCLUDING IN A SPACE SMALL PERCENTAGE PROVIDERS WHO HAVE ALREADY PARTICIPATED IN THIS TRAINING OUR FAMILY PHYSICIAN. AS PART OF A FAMILY PHYSICIANS RESIDENCY TRAINING MUST ALSO COMPLETE A MINIMUM OF ONE THIRD. OR ONE HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE HELLO.

THANK YOU MR MODERATOR THANK YOU TO ALL THE WITNESSES WHO'VE TESTIFIED WE WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO. MEMBERS ON THE FLOOR MEMBERS. DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS REGARDING SENATE BILL. FORTY EIGHT- FIRST TRUST NOTICE CENTER EGGMAN. BUT THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR HI I GUESS THE QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR WHY TAKE THE ROUTE OF MANDATING THE- THE COURSE VERSES AS AS THE OPPOSITION SUGGESTED LETTING THEM MEDICAL BOARD DECIDE IF ONE IS NEEDED OR NOT. THREE THANK YOU AND YOU KNOW OUR OUR INTENT IS THAT IS TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION BECAUSE IT'S OFTEN THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS- AND IN THE FAMILY POSITIONS THAT FIRST SEE- THE INDIVIDUALS AND SO. IT IS YOU KNOW PART OF THE- THE MASTER PLAN I THINK AFTER SEEN THE IN MASTER PLAN ON AGING AND HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS- ARE HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS ARE NOT GETTING DINERS WE NEED TO GET DIAGNOSED AND SO ARE OUR INTENT IS REALLY TO SAY LOOK THIS THIS SHOULD BE. SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE HAS SOME FAMILIARITY CERTAINLY WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR THE GENERAL SPECIALIST FOR FAMILY PHYSICIANS TO BECOME A SPECIALIST IN ANYWAYS- WE JUST WANT SOME UNDERSTANDING AND THIS COMES ALSO FROM SURVEYS FROM THE DECISIONS THEMSELVES SAYING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TRAINING OR INFORMATION. I KNOW THAT I'VE HEARD FROM POSITIONS AT THE I'D ABSOLUTELY WELCOME IT'S NOT MY SPECIALTY BUT I'D WELCOME KNOWING SOMETHING AND SO WE'RE TRYING TO IDENTIFY WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE- AS YOU KNOW THIS BILL WAS JUST INTRODUCED THIS IS THE FIRST HEARING SO WE'RE STILL IN CONVERSATIONS TO IDENTIFY. ANY THE CONVERSATIONON WHETHER IT SHOULD BE SHALL OR YOU KNOW- OR MAY I THINK IS PART OF THIS CONVERSATION OF WHAT WILL IT CHEAP AND WE'RE OPEN TO HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IT IS SHE'S AT THE END BECAUSE THE OUTCOME IS FOR MORE PEOPLE TO BE DIAGNOSED. AND I WOULD. AND I KNOW YOU ARE AN AUTHOR AS A LEAD. IN I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORKING ON I KNOW IT'S IMPORTANT- AND WITH I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. BUT PAN. THANK YOU- FAIR AND- FIRST OF ALL I DO APPRECIATE- THE AUTHORS GOALS AND THE SPONSORS SCHOOL OF- TRYING TO IMPROVE- SCREENING AND- AND MANAGEMENT OF- PEOPLE WITH DEMENTIA- AND HOWEVER I DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT THE APPROACH WHICH IS TO MANDATE CONTINUE EDUCATION IS NOT THE APPROPRIATE ONE OR DEFECTIVE WAY OF GOING ABOUT DOING THIS FACT IN THE PAST THIS COMMITTEE HAS- GENERALLY- DISCOURAGED- MANDATING CONCERNING EDUCATION BECAUSE OUT AS A MEDICAL EDUCATOR I TELL YOU THAT ADULT LEARNING PRINCIPLES BECAUSE WE WANT TO PLAY EVIDENCE TO OUR POLICIES. FIGLEY SAY THAT FOR ADULTS THAT SELF DIRECTED LEARNING IS THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO FOR PEOPLE TO LEARN SO MAKING SOMEONE SIT THROUGH A CLASS THAT THEY THEMSELVES- DID NOT CHOOSE BUT ARE REQUIRED TO IS NOT A VERY EFFECTIVE WAY OF TRYING TO- TO IMPROVE THEIR THEIR SKILLS SAID IN FACT I THINK THE I APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM SUPPORTERS BUT I'M NOT SURE THIS IS THE RIGHT SOLUTION. HOWEVER I WOULD SAY THAT- THAT THE ANSWERS ARE THE DRAWCONTRAST ACTUALLY IS FOR EXAMPLE- WE'RE TRYING TO IMPROVE- BECAUSE PETERSON WE'RE TRYING TO PROVE SCREENING FOR ADVERSE HEALTH EVENTS- SO WHAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IS MANDATE THAT PEDIATRICIANS AND OTHER PHYSICIANS TAKE YOUR CHILDREN ARE MANDATED TO SIT THROUGH S. C. C. COURSE ABOUT ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EVENTS BECAUSE SOME ACTUALLY ARE FAIRLY FAMILIAR JUDGE THEREFORE CHOOSE HOWEVER WHAT WE HAVE DONE IS WE'VE ESTABLISHED OUTCOME MEASURES- THROUGH OUR MEDICAL PROGRAM WE'VE- ALSO. SET QUALITY STANDARDS AROUND THAT AND I HOPE THAT THAT'S THE APPROACH THAT THE- THE PROPONENTS MIGHT WANT TO CONSIDER AS AN ALTERNATIVE SIDE THAT BECAUSE IT'S REALLY THE OUTCOME THAT MATTERS IT'S NOT THAT SOMEONE DID SOMEONE TO OF COURSE AND TAKE. THAT OFF THEY SAT THROUGH A COURSE INHOPEFULLY. AND FORTY THIS IS ALSO A HAVING SAN. THIS AND WE CAN ABOUT WIFE OUR VERSUS HOURS OR SIX HOURS- AND IT'S EVERY TWO YEARS. THAT SOMEONE DOES IT JUST TAKE THE SAME COURSE EVERY TWO YEARS IN ORDER TO CHECK OFF THE REQUIREMENTS OF WE'RE NOT EXACTLY- THREE OR KNOWLEDGE OR ACTUALLY TAKING AWAY THEIR OPPORTUNITY TO THAN TO TAKE COURSES AND OTHER THINGS THAT THEY HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. SO I APPRECIATE- THE AUTHORS- GOALS I WOULD CERTAINLY LOOK FORWARD TO THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO- TO WORK WITH YOU A CERTAIN AMOUNT ON THIS BUT FORTUNATE. CANNOT SUPPORT THE BILL AS IT IS AT THIS TIME BUT I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS AND I HOPE THAT- THOSE CONVERSATIONS ARE. BECOME FRUITFUL AND THAT WE CAN. REALLY LOOK AT A BILL THAT ACTUALLY WOULD IMPROVE OUTCOMES FOR- OUT PATIENTS WITH DEMENTIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATE-ROOM. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE CEREMONY I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON THIS BILL- MY FAMILY HAS HAD A DIRECT AND VERY PERSONAL EXPERIENCE WITH ALZHEIMER'S- AND ACTUALLY IT IT COMPLETELY CORRESPONDS TO THE SCENARIO OUTLINED. MY WIFE'S MOM. WAS. ASSESSED IN IMPROPERLY DIAGNOSED FRESHLY THREE YEARS BEFORE FINAL DIAGNOSIS WAS ACTUALLY MADE CLEAR THAT FALSE DIAGNOSIS UNFORTUNATELY GAVE MY FATHER IN LAW THE HOPE. THAT HIS BELOVED WIFE WAS NOT SUFFERING FROM DEMENTIA AND AS A RESULT HE FOUGHT THAT PROCESS FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND AS A CONSEQUENCE- NOT ONLY WAS HER CARE LESS THAN IDEAL BUT THE FAMILY LOST PRECIOUS TIME. WITH THEIR MOM SO I UNDERSTAND YOU'VE OFFERED TO TAKE AMENDMENTS- AND I AM GRATEFUL FOR THAT I COMMEND YOU ON THIS BILL AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK BE ADDED AS A CO AUTHOR RICHMOND FORD. THANK CENTER NEWMAN CENTER OF YOUR MAKEUP. I WANT TO THANK COLLEAGUE FOR I THINK THIS IS I WANT TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM FOR SHARING THAT- PERSONALS IN I WANT TO ECHO HIS SENTIMENTS ABOUT. THE GOALS OF THIS BILL- THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY INCREDIBLY LAUDABLE- I HAD A QUESTION A COUPLE QUESTIONS JUST THE FIRST WITH THIS BILL AS WRITTEN A PLIGHT OF PEDIATRICIANS. RIGHT NOW THE RIGHT NOW THE BILL- ONLY APPLIES. TO FAMILY PHYSICIANS PHYSICIANS ASSISTANTS AND GENERAL INTERNIST NOT. ALL OKAY JUST WANNA MAKE SURE JUST BECAUSE MY STAFF WAS NOT CLEAR FROM THE LANGUAGE IF IT MIGHT ALSO PLAYED PETERSON'S. AND I THINK I WOULD JUST- ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE OPEN AMENDMENTS AND THAT'S WONDERFUL JUST AROUND- TAILORING THE BILL JUST BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I HAVE A NUMBER OF PHYSICIANS IN MY FAMILY AND I THINK THAT THEY- WOULD ECHO SOME OF DR PANTS AND- I'M SORRY MY COLLEAGUE FROM SACRAMENTO'S CONCERNS- JUST AROUND- ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AND SO JUST MAKING SURE THAT. IT THE BILL IS TAILORED AND SO THAT THOSE WHO MIGHT BENEFIT FROM THIS ARE THE ONES RECEIVING IT WOULD BE. AMAZING BUT. I THANK YOU FOR PROPOSING THIS BILL. I THINK IT'S- THANK YOU SO MEN MEMBERS pOTHER. CENTER JONES. I THINK ANY OF TWO OTHER MICROPHONES UP AS WELL MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO SHARE THE- I SHARE THE CONCERNS OF THE OPPOSITION ON THE BILL SO I ALSO WON'T BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT I DO WANT THE FOLKS KNOW THEY'RE PROPOSING A BILL. THAT YOU KNOW I ANNUALLY PARTICIPATE IN THE ALZHEIMER AWARENESS DAY I'VE GOT TO THE PURPLE SASHES IN MY OFFICE RIGHT NOW- SO WE'LL KEEP UP THE EFFORTS OF- OF THAT BUT UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE CONCERNS- I WON'T BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU- CENTER JONES CENTER HER TITLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANT TO COMMEND THREE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD I THINK THAT THERE'S A REAL ISSUE TO ADDRESS HERE. AND BUT I THINK IT ALSO- I HAVE SOME CONCERNS REGARDING THE BILL AND HOW AND HOW IT'S BEING ADDRESSED I THINK WE DEFINITELY NEED TO HAVE A GREAT A CONVERSATION AROUND MEDICAL EDUCATION MEDICAL TRAINING AND CONTINUING EDUCATION- AND- I REALLY WANT TO WORK- WITH THE AUTHOR MOVING FORWARD BUT AT THE MOMENT DOES THE BILL STAND TAKEN NOT SUPPORTED. BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR AND MOVING THIS FALL ALONG THE WAY FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER OF TROUBLES. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK- I WOULD LIKE TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING FORTH SUCH AN IMPORTANT BILL AS SOMEONE WHO- HAS BEEN PERSONALLY TOUCHED IN OUR FAMILY WITH- WITH ALZHEIMER'S AND DEMENTIA I THINK THE GREATEST CONCERN THAT WE HAVE THAT IT TOOK OVER TEN YEARS. FOR OUR FAMILY MEMBER MY GRANDMOTHER IN THIS CASE WHO I HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE WITHIN MEXICO- WAS DIAGNOSED BEFORE SHE WAS DIAGNOSED AND THERE WAS A LOT OF HARM THAT HAPPENED IN THE PROCESS OF. NOT BEING DIAGNOSED BECAUSE WE DID NOT FIRST OF ALL WE'RE NOT VERY AWARE OF ALZHEIMER'S OR DEMENTIA AND- AND IT CREATED A LOT HAVE ACT. IN IN IN THE FAMILY SO. I DO APPRECIATE THE BILL'S I DO UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS OF DOCTOR PAN HOUSE. BUT I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY THAT THE- AUTHOR- HAS IN REGARDS TO AMENDING IT SO THAT IT DOES. ACCOMMODATE SOME OF THE CONCERNS BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE DO NEED MORE AWARENESS IN THE MEDICAL. PROFESSION ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT ARE IN DIRECT CONTACT WITH OUR WITH THE- WITH THE PEOPLE WHO COULD POTENTIALLY HAVE ALZHEIMER'S DEMENTIA SO I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE AWARENESS AND DEFINITELY MORE TRAINING IN. AND DIAGNOSING THE- THE- THE DISEASE WHICH STARTS VERY VERY LIGHT YEAH. INNOCUOUS SO- WITH THAT THOUGH- THANK YOU THANKS TO THE AUTHOR FOR WILLING TO WORK IN AND ACCEPT AMENDMENTS AND IF SHE WOULD ACCEPT A CO AUTHOR BE MORE THAN HAPPY TO SIGN ON TO THIS BILL. AND I DO MOVE- WE HOPE TO MOVE THIS AT BILLBOARD. THANK YOU MA'AM CENTER BECKER. TO RISE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THE POINT THAT THIS IS A GROWING PHENOMENON AS WE LIVE LONGER SAYS MR RIGHT NOW ABOUT ONE THIRD OF THOSE EIGHTY FIVE AND OLDER. HAVE ALZHEIMER'S AND I'VE HEARD ESTIMATES UP TO EIGHT ONE HALF OF FOLKS EIGHTY FIVE AN OLD OLDER WILL GET ALZHEIMER'S THIS IS INCREASING- THE INCREASING ISSUE AND I THINK THIS LEGISLATION IS VERY TIMELY. AND I THINK THE AUTHOR. THANK YOU SENATOR DODD. I YES I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS- FORWARD FOR THE REASONS MY COLLEAGUES OF ARTISTS- DESCRIBED. I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THIS ISSUE ABOUT MAKING THIS COURSE REPEATED EVERY TWO YEARS I DID NOT SEE THAT ANALYSIS I MAY HAVE MISSED IT. BUT I THINK I WOULD HOPE THAT THE AUTHOR WOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THAT- MOVING FORWARD AND- YOU KNOW WILL WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION ON THAT. POINT THANK YOU CENTER DOT ANY OTHER MEMBERS. SO ALONE I GUESS I HAVE A QUESTION AND A COMMENT I GUESS THIS- THIS IS CERTAINLY. TOUCHED US ALL AND IF IT HAS ENDED WILL I. MY MOTHER IN LAW AND MY UNCLE BOTH PASSED FROM ALZHEIMER'S ALZHEIMER'S RELATED COMPLICATIONS SO- I'M ACUTELY AWARE OF THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE AS OBVIOUSLY ARE MY COLLEAGUES IN MANY MANY MANY. THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY MY QUESTION IS GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND CERTAINLY ELSEWHERE PROBABLY THOUSANDS OF THEM ARE PROVIDING PRIMARY CARE TO RESIDENTS IN OUR STATE- EVERY DAY- WAS THERE A REASON THAT- OSTEOPATHIC PHYSICIANS- WERE LEFT. OUT OF THE EDUCATION REQUIREMENT REFERENCED IN YOUR BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU CHAIR YOU KNOW WE AGREED THAT MORE PEOPLE YOU KNOW MORE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD INCREASE THE UNDERSTANDING BUT WE DID WANT TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL- AND WE ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. THE FOR PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS ARE FOR SO MANY THE FIRST STOP IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T MEAN THAT WE CAN AND CONSIDER OTHERS BUT I THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR US TO NARROW AND GIVEN THE FEEDBACK OF THE COMMITTEE I WE ARE HAPPY TO COMMUNICATE- WITH OTHER PROVIDER GROUPS TO POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THEM IN THE FUTURE- BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW OUR GOAL IS TO START SOMEWHERE- AND I THINK THAT THIS IS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING WITH THE BILL GENERALLY IT. STARTS SOMEWHERE AND IT GIVES US POLICY TO DISCUSS AND WE'RE VERY OPEN TO AMENDMENTS WERE OPEN TO HAVING A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO REACH THE OUTCOME- THAT WE ALL WANT AND SO. CERTAINLY AGAIN WE'RE OPEN WE SAW IT IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND ARE OPEN TO DISCUSSIONS. THANK YOU SENATOR AND AS YOU MOVE HOPEFULLY MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD- THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE.

WELCOME SENATOR DODD YOU HAVE ONE BILL TODAY SENATE BILL. TWO SIXTEEN. THIS IS YOUR NOW THAT I MADE IT INTO THE- TO THE MICROPHONE. THIS WAS A TEST IS A TEST I FAILED AT MISERABLY. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. EVERY YEAR 55% OF LICENSE CONTRACTORS CLAIM TO HAVE NO EMPLOYEES AND FILE FOR AN EXEMPTION FROM HAVING WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE FOR THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. HOWEVER THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IN RESEARCH IN ENFORCEMENT CASE DATA DEMONSTRATES THAT MANY CONTRACTORS ARE FALSELY MAKING THAT CLAIM. THIS DRIVES UP THE COST OF WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE FOR THE GOOD ACTORS IT PUTS WORKERS AT RISK WHEN THEIR PLAYER LACKS SUCH INSURANCE. SB TWO SIXTEEN WILL HELP PROTECT WORKERS IN PRECLUDE THE FILING OF WORKERS COMPENSATION EXEMPTIONS FOR CONCRETE. HVAC IN TREE SERVICE CONTRACTORS AND BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE ALL CONTRACTORS TO MAINTAIN WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. REQUIRING ALL CONTRACTORS TO HAVE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE WILL PROTECT WORKERS WHO WERE INJURED ON THE JOB WHETHER THEY'RE WORKING FOR THE CONTRACTOR FOR A DAY A WEEK OR FULL TIME IT LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR LAW ABIDING CONTRACTORS. THE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEMIC PROBLEM OF CONTRACTORS CLAIMING AN EXEMPTION EVEN WHILE HAVING EMPLOYEES HAS LED TO UNFAIR INCREASES IN WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR COMPLY CONTRACTOR EMPLOYEES IN EXPOSES WORKERS AND CONSUMERS TO PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL RISKS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD IS MICHAEL JIM THAT SKI. THANK YOU A SENATOR AS WE PREVIOUSLY NOTED EACH SIDE WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES. ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY SHOULD LIMIT TESTIMONY TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE MEASURES PLEASE PROCEED. DO WE HAVE SOMEONE PRESENTING FROM THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD. OKAY EARLY- CENTER THEY'RE NOT ON THE LINE JUST. IS UPS OKAY WHICH PROVIDES NEXT I HEAR FROM WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY. GOOD MORNING SHARE MEMBERS MIGHT CHEN THAT HE FOR THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD THE BOARD IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR SB TWO ONE SIX. AS THE SENATOR STATED- EVERY YEAR 55% OF LICENSE CONTRACTORS TO FILE AN EXEMPTION CLAIMING THEY HAVE NO EMPLOYEES AND THE ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATIONS DO BEAR OUT THAT MANY OF THEM IN FACT DO. SO THE EXISTING STRUCTURE OF ALLOWING A LICENSED CONTRACTOR TO FILE EITHER PROOF OF INSURANCE OR AN EXEMPTION HAS NOT BEEN EFFECTIVE. NOW THE BOARD IS OF COURSE COMMITTED TO EXERCISING ITS LIMITED AUTHORITY IN THIS AREA AS IT STANDS IT TO PROTECT WORKERS AND TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC IT DOES SO BY TAKING ADMINISTRATIVE OR CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST LICENSED OR UNLICENSED CONTRACTORS. WERE FOUND TO HAVE EMPLOYEES BUT HAVE NO COVERAGE IN PLACE. EVERY YEAR THEBOARD DOES ISSUE HUNDREDS OF STOP WORK ORDERS OR LEGAL ACTION FOR HAVING A FAULT EXEMPTION ON FILE- BUT AFFORD. THIS HAS NOT MOVED THE PROVERBIAL NEEDLE AS A NUMBER OF EXEMPTIONS THAT REMAIN CONSISTENT EVERY YEAR. AND THE BOARD IS SIMPLY NOT STAFF TO AUDIT THE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY THREE THOUSAND OR SO CONTRACTORS WHO CLAIM NOT TO HAVE EMPLOYEES. SO WITH THAT SAID- WE APPRECIATE YOUR AYE VOTE AND I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH. THANK YOU.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GUESS I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR AND I THINK WE'VE ALL. BEEN EXPERIENCING. SURE PROJECTS AROUND THE HOUSE THAT WE'VE HIRED CONTRACTORS FOR. THEM WHAT WHAT HAPPENS- IF SOMEBODY IS JUST A ONE PERSON CONTRACTING ASSOCIATION- ONE PERSON BUSINESS. WELL IF IT. HI MAY- THE YOU KNOW- ALLOW THE- YOU KNOW THE GENTLEMAN FROM STATE CONTRACTORS LICENSE BOARD TO OPINE ON THIS BUT BY MY READING OF THIS IS IF THEY LEGITIMATELY ARE A ONE PERSON OPERATION THAT THEY WOULD EITHER BE GET EXACT OR PERHAPS PAVE THE OFFER FOR THEIR FOR THEMSELVES THE LOOKS AT THE IF YOU STILL. APPEAR SIR HELLO I THANK YOU MY TRINITY FOR THE CONTRACTORS BOARD THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION JUST SOME VERY VERY QUICK BACKGROUND ON OUR LICENSING STRUCTURE SO OUR LICENSES ARE ACTUALLY ISSUED TO THE ENTITY NOT THE INDIVIDUAL SO WE DO ISSUE TO SOLVE OWNERSHIPS CORPORATIONS LLCS JOURNAL PARTNERSHIPS AND JOINT VENTURES HOWEVER THE SOLE OWNERSHIP ENTITY REALLY WORK FOR ALL OF THESE ENTITIES WHAT THAT TELLS YOU IT'S JUST. WHAT PERCENTAGE OF OWNERSHIP THERE IS BUT THERE'S AMPLE EVIDENCE THAT A NUMBER OF SOLE OWNERS HAVE- EMPLOYEES HAS BORNE OUT IN OUR ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS ABOUT 70% OF OUR STOP WORK ORDERS ISSUED ON ACTIVE JOB SITES ARE TO THE SOLE OWNERS WHO HAVE AN EXEMPTION ON FILE AND 66% OF THE LEGAL ACTIONS- THAT ARE TAKEN FOR A FAULT EXEMPTION ARE TO SELL OWNERS SO- WHILE THE BOARD IS CERTAINLY COGNIZANT THAT THERE MAY INDEED AND THERE LIKELY ARE TRUE SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS OUT THERE WAS TRULY SOLD ONE PERSON OPERATIONS THE EVIDENCE BEARS OUT THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER A LARGE NUMBER OF. SOLE OWNERSHIP ENTITIES THAT HAVE EMPLOYEES AND THE OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE DOESN'T TEND TO INDICATE WHETHER OR NOT THEY WILL HAVE EMPLOYEES I HOPE THAT ANSWERS THE QUESTIONS IN ADVANCE- THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE LICENSES I INDICATED TO YOU OUR TEAM. WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE THANKS. SO I HEAR THAT THAT THERE IS NO. EXCEPTIONS WHEN I READ EVERY DAY EVERYBODY HAS TO IT WHETHER A SOLE. OWNER NOT. THANK YOU OF CENTER TO A- S. YES THANK OU MEASURE I- WOULD LIKE TO STAND IN SUPPORT SENATE BILL TWO SIXTEEN WHEN I HEARD NUMBERS THAT WOULD JUST BE GIVEN AS TO WHAT THE LICENSING BOARD. THE FACT THAT THAT SO MANY EMPLOYEES THAT FEEL CONFIDENT WHEN THEY WORK WITH CONTRACTOR THAT THEY WILL BE PROTECTED AND WE ALL KNOW THAT DURING THIS PANDEMIC SO MANY PEOPLE OF THE ESSENTIAL WORKERS WORKING TO BUILD THEM IN OUR ROADS AND WHATEVER THEY WERE DOING- THEY WERE DOING IT WITH A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE THAT GOD FORBID SOMETHING HAPPENS THEIR FAMILIES WOULD BE PROTECTED. AND THE- INSURANCE WOULD BE THERE FOR WORKMAN'S COMPENSATION STATION THIS IS JUST A SMALL FRY A FRAGMENT OF THEIR SUPPORT AND TO FIND THAT THERE ARE SO MANY- THAT ARE NOT PROTECTED IF THIS IS OUR FIRST STEP TO MAKE SURE WE EQUALIZE IT WE LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD SO WITH THAT I URGE THE AYE VOTE.

GOOD MORNING MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE TODAY I PRESENT SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY THREE WHICH IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WILL HELP CORRECT THE LONG HISTORY OF BIAS AGAINST PEOPLE OF COLOR WHEN IT COMES TO OWNING A HOME SB TWO SIXTY THREE REPORTS REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS TO TAKE IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING AS PART OF THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY IS NECESSARY BECAUSE THE HOMEOWNERSHIP GAP FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR IN CALIFORNIA IT'S NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE CONSIDERING THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE EIGHT TWENTY TWENTY REPORT BY THE GREEN LINE INSTITUTE FOUND THAT CALIFORNIA'S BLACK HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE IS 35% AND LET YOU KNOW HOMEOWNERSHIP SEPARATE IS 42% BOTH OF THESE RATES ARE FAR LOWER THAN CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL OVERALL HOMEOWNERSHIP RATE. WE CAN AND MUST DO BETTER TO END THE BIAS THAT IS CAUSING THIS HOMEOWNERSHIP GAP FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR THANKFULLY THERE IS CONSENSUS ON THIS ISSUE THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND THERE IS NO OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. AND TODAY THE PHONE TO TESTIFY HAVE ANNA BUCK THE CALIFORNIA. OF REALTORS. THANK YOU THANK YOU A REMINDER THAT EACH SIDE WILL ONLY BE PERMITTED A TOTAL OF THREE MINUTES ALL OTHERS WISHING TO TESTIFY MUST LIMIT THEIR COMMENTS TO THEIR NAME AFFILIATION. AND POSITION ON THE MEASURES MISBACH. HI GOOD MORNING MISTER KAREN MEMBERS OF THE OMMITTEE MY NAME IS ANNA BACH AND I AM HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. AND YOU'VE HEARD THE BILL'S AUTHOR THIS MORNING AT THE TWO SIXTY THREE AT THE REQUIREMENT OF IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING THROUGH THE EXISTING CONTINUING EDUCATION REQUIREMENTS. FOR REAL ESTATE LICENSEES IT ALSO UPDATE THE CURRENT FAIR HOUSING TRAINING REQUIREMENTS TO INCLUDE ELEMENTS SUCH AS ROLE PLAY SCENARIOS. THAT ALLOW LICENSEES TO WALK IN THE SHOES OF SOMEONE EXPERIENCING HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. LAST SESSION AB TWO FOUR ONE. OUR BY ASSEMBLY COME LONGER DE REQUIRE. IMPLICIT TRAINING FOR SIR HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS. AB TWO FOR TWO BY THE SAME AUTHOR REQUIRED IMPLICIT BIAS TRAINING FOR COURT EMPLOYEES. JUDGES AND ATTORNEYS. JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS AND HEALTHCARE SERVICES HAVE THE POWER TO CHANGE THE PROJECT TO DECORATE THE CHRISTMAS LIGHTS. AND BIAS IN THESE AREAS CAN HAVE THE DISTURBING THE FACT OF UNDERMINING CONFIDENCE IN THESE SYSTEMS. AND IT'S BEEN LIVING THE ACTIVE A HOME. CAN ALSO HE SAID BACK DURING THE PRE LIFE FOR THE VAST OF. PURCHASING A HOME IS LARGEST AND MOST IMPORTANT FINANCIAL TRANSACTION THEY WILL EVER MAKE. IT HAS THE POWER TO SET A FAMILY ON A CORD TO CREATING FINANCIAL SECURITY AND GENERATIONAL WELL. AS AN ORGANIZATION WE WANT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO ENSURE THAT THIS PROCESS IS. AS FAIR AND EXPERIENCE FROM BY AT THE POSSIBLE WHAT IS OF COURSE IMPOSSIBLE TO ELIMINATE IMPLICIT BIAS. TRAINING COURSES GIVE PEOPLE THE OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE AND ADJUST THEIR PATTERNS OF THINKING WITH THE GOAL OF ELIMINATING BIAS. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS PRICES JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND. OTHER STATE APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY TWO THOUSAND REAL ESTATE LICENSEES NOT ALL OF THESE LICENSEES ARE REALTORS BUT WE BELIEVE ALL REAL ESTATE PROFESSIONALS- THE INTERACT. WITH THE PUBLIC IN CONSUMERS- SHOULD BENEFIT FROM THE TRAINING AS AN ORGANIZATION WE HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED LEGISLATION THAT WILL ENHANCE CONSUMER PROTECTION A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION. AND IN RECENT TIMES WE ARE PROUD TO SAY THAT IS ALSO INCLUDED FAIR HOUSING INITIATIVES. IF YOU ARE GREETED MANDELA PROFESSIONALS THAT EVERYONE OPERATE TO THE HIGHEST ETHICAL STANDARDS AND THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY ASKING FOR YOUR I. BOATS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WE WILL HEAR FROM ANY WITNESSES IN THE GALLERY AND I SEE NONE. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WHO WISH TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF SENATE BILL TWO SIX THREE.

THANKS PRAYER I THINK THANK YOU AND US ARE RUBIO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- AND THE CERTAINLY VERY SUPPORTIVE AND- APPRECIATE THE LEADERSHIP OF THE REALTORS I GUESS MY QUESTION IS THAT- IS THERE WHITE TWO HOURS- AND HAVE YOU CONSIDERED INSTEAD OF TURN IT IS AN OUTCOME MEASURE I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE DEVELOP A CERTAIN LEVEL OF KNOWLEDGE OR AWARENESS IS VERSUS A FIXED NUMBER OF HOURS- FOR THE FOR THE- REQUIREMENTS THAT WE'RE ESTABLISHING. THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUGGESTION- YOU KNOW AND I DEFINITELY THINK THIS YEAR APPOINTMENT IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. UNLIKE OTHERS YOU KNOW IT IS A TWO HOUR REQUIREMENT BUT IT IS ALREADY IT'S FOLDED INTO WHAT IT'S ALREADY REQUIRED FOR REALTORS SO WE'RE NOT ADDING EXTRA HOURS. AND AS I HEARD EARLIER IN. YOUR TESTIMONY YOU KNOW WE JUST WANT TO MAKE PEOPLE AWARE AND THERE HAVE BEEN REALLY AGREE JUST CASES IN WHICH- EMAIL PEOPLE OF COLOR HAVE TRIED TO GET IT OUT. LET'S SAY AN ASSESSMENT ON THEIR HOME AND THE OUTCOME IS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT WHEN THEY GET WHITE FRIENDS TO POSE. NOW IS SELLING A HOME I MEAN IN ONE CASE ONE HOME WAS APPRAISED AT HALF A MILLION. DOLLARS HIGHER. THAN WHAT THE BLACK COUPLE HAVE RECEIVED WHEN THEY ARE ENCOURAGED THAT THEIR WHITE. FRIENDS TO POSE AS THE OWNERS AND STAGE THE HOME WITH THEIR FAMILY PICTURES OF WHITE FAMILIES. HALF A MILLION MORE CELL. IT IS NECESSARY AND THE TWO HOURS IS FOLDED INTO THIS ALREADY REQUIRED UP HOURS OF TRAINING. SO IT JUST IS REALLY ABOUT MAKING PEOPLE AWARE AND- AND I THINK IT'S A GREAT START. AS THAT- I- EIGHT AGAIN I SUPPOSE FULLY SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TO SHE AND SIR APPRECIATE THAT- BUILDERS OF CELLS ARE SPONSORS THIS BILL. HI JUST USUALLY SUGGEST PEOPLE LOOK AT OUTCOMES VERSUS. TAKING UP TIME TO SOMEONE COULD SPEND TWO HOURS AND NOT REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT VERSUS SOMEONE COULD ACTUALLY HOPEFULLY EVEN SEE COMPETENCY SOME OTHERS AND AT LAST TIME. AND SO WE'RE NOT JUST TO HELP TIME BUT WITH THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH US REALLY HAPPY WITH THE BILL TO PROTECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU CAN I SURE JUST A LITTLE BIT TO TALK ON TO THAT AND I DO ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT WHAT YOU'RE SAYING BUT THE THERE IS ACTIONABLE STEPS HERE AND- I BELIEVE AS THE WITNESS TESTIFIED FOR HIS ROLE PLAYING AND JUST TO REALLY. HAVE AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT IT IS NOT JUST SOMETHING THAT WE HEAR A STUDENTS TO COME YOU KNOW WE DON'T NECESSARILY. REALLY UNDERSTAND THIS THERE'S REAL PLAIN SOUL WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT OUTCOMES WE HELD TOGETHER INFORMATION AND MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND. WHAT WE NEED TO CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. THANK CENTER BACK. CONTRA THE AUTHOR FOR BILL WERE FIGHTING IMPLICIT BIAS AT MANY LEVELS OF OUR CULTURE AS WAS MENTIONED AT THE BEGINNING THAT WE HAVE WE TACKLE ANOTHER AREAS BUT IT'S ESPECIALLY. FUN HARMFUL IN THIS AREA IN ROB'S COMMITTEES COLORS OF MUSIC COLOR THE MOST BASIC NEED OF A SAFE PLACE TO LIVE. IN MY OWN DISAGREED ON A NUMBER OF. MEETINGS RECENTLY WERE JUST COMING TO GRIPS AYE I'VE LEARNED A LOT. ABOUT THE HISTORY STRUCTURE RACISM AND IN HOUSING AND MY COMMUNITIES- AND THE- DAMAGES INFLICTED ON PEOPLE OF COLOR NOT ONLY THE RED LINE BUT- IT PREVENTED FROM LIVING IN CERTAIN NEIGHBOURHOODS HISTORICALLY. BUT REALLY THAT DENIES A GENERATIONAL WEALTH THAT HOMEOWNERSHIP. BRINGS WHICH BROADENS THE WHICH WIDENS THE RACIAL ECONOMIC DIVIDE IN OUR COUNTRY SO I THINK THIS IS A STRONG STEP FORWARD. AND. I AM IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER JONES. BERMAN I DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL AND SIMILAR TO SB FORTY EIGHT EARLIER I THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO SET A REALLY HIGH BAR AND SHOW SOME RESTRAINT WHEN WERE- INTERFERING WITH THE DIFFERENT BOARDS AND COMMISSIONS AND HOW THEY- ESTABLISH CONTINUING EDUCATION. I CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE AUTHOR- HER CONCERNS AND THAT THE STORY THAT SHE SHARED THAT SHE SHARED WITH ME PERSONALLY- IN IT AND THAT IS A TROUBLESOME STORY- YOU KNOW MAYBE APPRAISERS WE NEED TO BE LOOKING AT AT THEIR CONTINUING EDUCATION PROGRAM AS WELL. I DO BELIEVE THAT- I HAVE A VERY CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE THREE REALTOR ASSOCIATIONS IN MY IN IN MY COUNTY IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY- THAT REPRESENT- A HUGE NUMBER REALTORS. AND I THINK YOU KNOW ALL THREE OF THEIR BOARDS ARE- IT IS THERE'S A LOT OF DIVERSITY ON ALL THREE OF THOSE BOARDS THE- THE SPEAKER AND SUPPORT OF THE- BILL ACTUALLY REYES ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THERE'S- FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY THOUSAND LICENSEES. AND CALIFORNIA AND LESS THAN HALF OF THOSE ARE RECOGNIZED AS CAPITAL ARE REALTORS. AND SO WE'RE PROPOSING YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW THE PROCESS ENTIRE SPECTRUM OF THE INDUSTRY- AND SO THAT THAT RAISES CONCERN FOR ME ONE OF THE OTHER CONCERNS AND I WOULD IF THE AUTHOR WOULD MIND SPEAKING TO THIS- THE ROLE PLAY COMPONENT. YOU KNOW MOST OF THE I THINK ALL OF THE REALTOR CONTINUE EDUCATION NOW CAN BE DONE ONLINE THROUGH THE GRE. AND IS THAT CREATES- A UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCE OR DO A ROLE PLAY SO IF THE SPEAKER WOULD. LIKE TO EXPLAIN THAT I AM CURIOUS ABOUT HOW THE ROLE PLAYED THING WOULD WORK BUT UNFORTUNATELY I CAN'T SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS. AND I KNOW THAT IT DOES YOU KNOW IMPACT ALL THE LICENSEES BUT- I THINK I THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE TO START I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT AND THERE'S DOCUMENTATION SOMETIMES WE DON'T EVEN REALIZE BECAUSE IT'S NOT. SOMETHING THAT W CAN WE THINK ABOUT SO I JUST WANTED TO SHARE THAT CURRENTLY- THERE IS A REPORT THAT CAME OUT THAT SPEAKS TO THE HOMES. AND NEIGHBORHOODS WITH SIMILAR AMENITIES AND LOS ANGELES WERE BLACK MAJORITY NEIGHBORHOODS FOR SEVENTEEN POINT 1% LESS. THEIR WORTH IS LESS 71% JUST FOR BEING A BLACK NEIGHBORHOODS IN THE BAY AREA. LOCATED IN BLUE MUCH NEIGHBORHOOD IS TWENTY SEVEN POINT ONE PERCENT. LESS SO I KNOW THAT THESE ARE NOT THINGS THAT WE TYPICALLY THINK ABOUT IT BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE DISPARITY IN AND OUT OF THE PROPERTY VALUE JUST BECAUSE IT'S A MINORITY COMMUNITY. MY MINORITY OWNED COMMUNITY. IT IS SOMETHING THAT IT IS IT IS REALLY MIND BOGGLING FOR ME PERSONALLY AS A MINORITY. FEMALE AND MISTER JONES AP SHARE COMMENT. BUT IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN AND I THINK THAT JUST HAVING THIS KNOWLEDGE DOESN'T. HURT BUT IT DOES HELP MOVING FORWARD AND THEN I WILL HI WELCOME TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND SEE HOW I CAN MAKE IT BETTER I'M OPEN TO THAT CONVERSATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEND A MAN. THANK YOU SENATOR I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THIS BILL- I THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS. AND I HAVE CONFESSED THIS IS NOT A FIELD I'M SUPER FAMILIAR WITH BUT I HAVE HAD COLLEAGUES IN THE PAST WHO ARE LEADING EXPERTS IN THIS AREA HI AND I THINK THAT SOME OF THE ID HERE IT'S IS THAT A SIMPLICITY IT'S COMES FROM PEOPLE WHO. YOU KNOW THESE ARE NOT THE KKK OR OPEN RACISTS OF THE PASSER THERE PEOPLE THAT ARE WE WOULD CALL GOOD PEOPLE- THEY THEY THINK OF THEMSELVES OF RACE NEUTRAL BUT WE ALL HAVE RACIAL BIASES I HAVE RACIAL BIASES EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM HAS RACIAL BIASES. AND I THINK THE WHOLE POINT OF AN EDUCATIONAL ENVIRONMENT IS TO RECOGNIZE THAT NOW MANY OF US MAY HAVE READ THAT STORY ABOUT. THE BLACK COUPLE IN MARIN. AND THEN IT GOT AN APPRAISAL FOR THEIR HOME. ARE THEY THOUGHT IT WAS LOW AND SO THEY WENT OUT AND GOT A WHITE FRIEND OF THEIRS TO POSE AS THE HOME BUYER- THAT NEXT APPRAISAL THEY HAD WITH THE WHITE THIS PRINCIPLES AT HOME BUYER WAS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS GREATER. HI THIS IS ONE OF MANY EXAMPLES IN THIS ONE WAS VERY STARKLY DOCUMENTED I IT WAS IN THE NEWS THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. BUT IF YOU ARE PARTICULARLY UNDERREPRESENTED MINORITY YOU ARE FACING THIS TYPE OF IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS THROUGHOUT YOUR LIFE AND AS MANY OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE ELOQUENTLY POINTED OUT HOMEOWNERSHIP. IS SO IMPORTANT. FOR BUILDING AT FOR. WEALTH AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT AS A RESULT THAT WE TRY TO DO ALL WE CAN TO AND IMPLICIT RACIAL BIAS. IN THIS REGARD AND SO I THINK THIS IS A GREAT FIRST STEP I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF US TO THINK ABOUT WHAT WE MIGHT DO GOING FORWARD BECAUSE EDUCATION. IS IMPORTANT BUT MAY NOT BE ENOUGH AND I LOOK FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT WHAT WE AS A BODY CAN DO BECAUSE- THIS IS AN IMPORTANT. ASPECT OF. OUR ECONOMIC WELL BEING IN THE STATE. SIDE SUPPORT THIS BILL INTENDED BEFORE THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU SENATOR CENTER ARCHULETA. YES THANK YOU MISTER. I'D LIKE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT SENATE BILL TWO SIXTY THREE WILL OBVIOUSLY OPEN THE DOOR TO REALITY. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT. THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS A PROFESSIONAL. ETHICAL ASSOCIATION DEALING WITH- PROFESSIONAL REAL ESTATE AGENTS. WHO ARE MEMBERS OF THE ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. BUT AGAIN AS- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES MENTIONED THERE'S FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND APPROXIMATELY LICENSED. REAL ESTATE AGENTS ACROSS THE STATE. BUT MAYBE ONLY TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND OUR ACTUAL REALTORS. TO THE REALTORS ASSOCIATION ARE CONSTANTLY GIVING CONTINUING EDUCATION CONTINUOUS TEACHINGS AND GUIDING- OF FAIR PRACTICES BUT THIS BILL. ADDRESSES THE BLANKET ACROSS THE BOARD THAT ALL. PEOPLE WITH REAL ESTATE LICENSE SHOULD BE AWARE OF THIS PRESIDENT BIASES THAT THEY MAY CONTAIN. AT THE TREAT EVERYBODY FAIRLY GIVEN EVERYONE THE EQUAL OPPORTUNITY. SO SOMEONE CAN CROSS THE LINE AND GO TO THE OTHER SIDE OF THE TRACKS PER SE AND PARTICIPATE IN BETTER SCHOOLS BETTER- EDUCATION FOR THEIR KIDS OR BETTER SHOPPING OR BETTER JOBS WHATEVER. AND THAT WOULD JUST MELT TOGETHER AS WE SHOULD AS AMERICANS IT NOT LOOKING THAT ONE'S- SKIN COLOR OR THEIR BACKGROUND OR THE RELIGION OR WHATEVER. IN WE'VE GOT TO OPEN UP THE STORE IN THESE ADDITIONAL HOURS IF THAT WILL HELP. BY ALL MEANS LET'S DO IT THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. IS A SAND YES- THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS TO SAY YES AND I IS A LICENSED REAL ESTATE BROKER AND A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF REALTORS I TO SAY YES. SO I AGREE AS B. TWO SIXTY THREE SHOULD BE ACCEPTED. AND I HOLD PROBABLY HARD TO THE SUPPORT. THANK YOU MR. THANK YOU SENATOR MEMBERS ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OR COMMENTS OF THE AUTHOR. SEEING THAT. THURMOND AS SORRY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN SIR WE HAVE. HAD A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT- THE APPRAISAL OF HOMES AND THERE'S HOMES COMING IN- THE VALUE COMING IN LOWER THAN WHAT IT WOULD COMMAND IF A WHITE COUPLE WERE SHOWING THE HOME AND WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THIS BILL RELATES TO- REAL ESTATE AGENTS BUT. THIS DOESN'T COVERED THOSE WHO DO APPRAISALS OF HOMES RATE. SO IF THAT'S- WHAT WE'RE FOCUSING ON. IT DOESN'T SEEM LIKE IT ADDRESSES- WHERE IN A PART OF THAT PROBLEM IS GENERATING FIRM. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THEM HELLO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENT AND I AND THAT ONLY JUST INDICATES HOW WIDESPREAD THIS THIS ISSUE AS AND WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS ISSUE FROM ALL ANGLES WHEN I SHARED SOME OF THE DATA ALREADY HERE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW THE VALUE OF HOMES AND AS WE SHARED SOMEBODY AND THERE IS A LOT OF EXAMPLES ON THE BOOKS IN TERMS OF REALTORS APPRAISERS. THIS IS ONE ISSUE BUT YOU'RE RIGHT AND I HOPE TO MOVE FORWARD IN THE FUTURE TO TACKLE THE APPRAISER SIDE OF THE ISSUE BYE DAD THANK YOU FOR POINTING THAT OUT I THINK THAT JUSTICE IN PARTICULAR GIVEN THE HISTORICAL AND SOCIAL IMPACTS OF THOSE BIASES IT'S JUST INFORMATIVE AND I THINK AS I STATED EARLIER HE JUST HELPED EVERYONE START THINKING ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND JUST RECOGNIZING YOUR OWN BIASES SO- I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND- THANK YOU. SERMON I AND I THINK THAT LAST QUESTION WAS RAISED BY ONE OF MY COMMENTS AND SO I JUST WANTED TO QUICKLY ADDRESS THAT. OF COURSE THIS BILL REFERS TO REALTORS AND NOT APPRAISERS- BUT I GAVE THAT EXAMPLE AS AN EXAMPLE OF THE EXTENT TO WHICH IMPLICIT BIAS- IS RAMPANT THE REAL ESTATE TRANSACTIONS AT THE STATE. THANK MISTER. THANK YOU I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- CENTER RUBIO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU FARE AND WOULD JUST WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR COMMENTS THOSE THAT ARE SUPPORTIVE AND THOSE THAT HAVE QUESTIONS YOU KNOW I JUST I'M GLAD THAT IT OPENED UP THE CONVERSATION AND WE CAN TO SOLVE DOES RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS AN ISSUE AND I'M OPEN TO DISCUSSING IT WITH MY COLLEAGUES WHO STILL HAVE CONCERNS AND SEE HOW WE CAN MAKE IT BETTER.

AND SO MANY OF THEM BEING DISPOSED OF LIFE BY FOLKS WHO DON'T NEED THEM ANYMORE SO THIS IS A GOOD COMMONSENSE SOLUTION WE NEED THAT SYSTEM SET UP. SO IT'S EASY FOR PEOPLE TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THEIR UNUSED MEDICATIONS FOR OTHER SINCE IT IS A GREAT BILL AND I WOULD MAKE THE MOTION TO MOVE THE BILL WHEN IT'S- WHEN THAT TIME IS. THANK YOU SENATOR SENATE-ROOM. AT DAVIS JACK I WOULD TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR IN THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL THIS IS A CREATIVE INNOVATIVE SOLUTION TO AREAL PROBLEM FOR FAMILIES AND SO- I WILL I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK ME AND IS A CO AUTHOR AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS MEMBERS SACRAMENTO. I ALSO WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUES FOR BRINGING THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE SENATE- THIS BILL REMOVES BARRIERS TO LIFE SAVING MEDICATION WHICH WE KNOW IS ONE OF THE LARGEST ISSUES IN MEDICINE IN THIS COUNTRY BUT I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO DIRECTLY ADDRESS THE CENTRAL ISSUE AT HAND. ASCRIPTION DRUG PRICES THE UNITED STATES ARE MORE THAN TWICE AS HIGH AS IN OTHER COUNTRIES AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG EXPENDITURES ALONE ACCOUNT FOR SEVENTEEN PERCENT. OF THE OVERALL COST OF HEALTHCARE IN THE UNITED STATES. 30% OF AMERICANS WHO CURRENTLY HAVE PRESCRIPTION MEDICINE SAY THEY HAVE SEEN INCREASES IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND OBVIOUSLY THIS FINANCIAL BURDEN IS ONLY INTENSIFIED FOR CANCER PATIENTS AS THE AUTHOR NOTES. ARE CANCER PATIENTS DECLARE BANKRUPTCY AT HIGHER RATES THAN OTHERS. AND ARE SUBJECTED TO IT AMAZING AND HORRENDOUS FINANCIAL HARDSHIPS- THIS ABUSE WILL CONTINUE. UNTIL WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE SO THIS IS A GREAT START I APPRECIATE THE INGENUITY BEHIND THIS- BUT NO ONE IN THIS COUNTRY SHOULD GO BANKRUPT. OR FACE THE POSSIBILITY OF DEATH BECAUSE THEY LACK HEALTH INSURANCE AND I THINK WE NEED TO MOVE IN THAT DIRECTION. HI SIR THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS I INTEND TO VOTE I'D THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU CENTER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SEEING NONE. THE BILL HAS BEEN- WELL CENTER RUBIO WHICH LIKE CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER TURN THINKING TOM MY COLLEAGUES HAVE JOINED THE WHO HAVE JOINED ME AND AN AUTHORSHIP AND NOT JUST ONE ALSO- JUST SAY THAT THAT THIS MEASURE IS VERY NARROW BUT IT'S RELIEF WITH THE HI FOCUS ON SAFETY AND A SOMEONE JUST CURRY STATED IT REMOVES BARRIERS AND IT SAVES LIVES AND TRAGICALLY PATIENTS HAVE DIED BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD THE MEDICATION OR DO NOT GET IT IN A TIMELY MANNER AND SO THIS PROGRAM IS NOT NEW. IT'S BEEN TRIED IN OTHER STATES SUCCESSFULLY AND WE JUST WANT CALIFORNIA TO CATCH UP IN THIS VERY IMPORTANT STAFF AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR RIFLE THANK YOU.

BUT A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND THREE BETWEEN AMERICA CULTURALLY ALLEGING AND THE S. R. T. TO DESIGN THE ARE A EXTENDER PROGRAM. PROVIDES A CAREER PATH FOR RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS TO ADVANCE THEIR PROFESSION AND WHAT IS A DANCE TRAINING- IT ALLOWS THE R. EIGHT. TO ASSIST RADIOLOGISTS IN THE DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING SETTING. THEY ARE UNDER DIRECT SUPERVISION THEY'RE ALLOWED TO PERFORM PATIENT ASSESSMENT. FOR MANAGEMENT SELECTED QUALITY IMAGING PROCEDURES. SENATE ARCHULETA INDICATED THAT YOU'RE NOT HER. FOR MANY FINAL.

GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF CURTIS PLAYING WITH- CALIFORNIANS ARE BOTH. REPRESENTING MORE THAN A HUNDRED THOUSAND BOB YOU'RE READY FOR NURSING SO SORRY FOR THE- ECHO I DON'T HAVE A SPEAKER PHONE NOT SURE WHAT'S GOING ON. HOWEVER- WE- OPPOSE SB THREE SEVENTY SEVEN. MEASURE PROVIDE MORE CONTEST OF ACTION THE OUT THIS ASSISTANCE ALSO EXPANDS THE SCOPE- THIS ONE LIFE PERFECT. WHERE PROJECT CONCERNED ABOUT IT AUTHORIZER GALA JUST- SYSTEM TO ADMINISTER PRESCRIBED DRUGS. FOR INSTANCE THE ADMINISTRATION AND MONITORING OF A PATIENT ON CONSCIOUS SEDATION REQUIRES UNINVITED INTO THE PATIENT SO WHAT'S ISN'T- HUB AND LOGICAL YOU JUST COULD ALSO BE SIMULTANEOUSLY. ADMINISTERING CONSCIOUS SEDATION REQUIRES DIRECT OR IMMEDIATE SUPERVISION THIS BILL ONLY REQUIRES ARE RAISED IN A PRIVATE DRUGS UNDER GENERAL SUPERVISION WHAT DOES NOT MEAN THE PRESENCE OF THE RADIOLOGY WHICH IS VERY DANGEROUS- ULTIMATE WE- QUESTIONED THE NECESSITY OF CREATING THIS. NEW CATEGORY OF HEALTHCARE WORKERS. AND ARE CONCERNED THAT THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW TYPE OF PRACTITIONER WILL LEAD TO MORE RIGHT MANY. AIR FOR RADIO STATION. BOTH POSITION ASSISTANCE AND NURSE PRACTITIONERS CAN FUNCTION IN RADIOLOGY- NON POSITION ACTIVE. THE INTERVENTIONAL RADIOLOGY NURSE PRACTITIONER IS A MASTER'S PREPARED PROVIDER THAT COMPLEMENTS THE ROLE OF THE READY OUT IT. THROUGH THE APPLICATION OF IT AND THIS TECHNICAL SKILLS THE CUTE CARE AND AMBULATORY CARE SAID. IN ADDITION TO POSITION ASSISTANT AT S. PRACTITIONERS. CERTIFIED RADIOLOGY MISSION REFORM SPECIFIED OR I'M SORRY SUPPORT OF SERVICES UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF RADIOLOGISTS BUT THERE ARE NUMBER OF EXISTING ROLES AND PRACTICE OR THE BILL THE SUPPORT RADIOLOGIST WE NEED. ALSO SOME HAVE ASSERTED. BY THE CAREER LADDER FOR RADIOLOGY WILL BE ALLOWED THE TECHNICIAN. HOWEVER BECAUSE THE BILL REQUIRE IN OUR A TO ALL WILL BE A RADIOLOGICAL. THIS BILL WOULD POTENTIALLY UNDERMINE THE EMPLOYABILITY APART. WISH TO GO ON TO BECOME AN RA BECAUSE THERE WOULD BE LITTLE IN A BOY BOTH AT THE SAME TIME. TO SOME CIRCUMVENT THE FOR- FRAGMENTS IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE FOR PATIENTS OFF MEDICATIONS. RESPECT WITHOUT FOR YOUR NOBLE TODAY. THANK YOU NEXT.

NO ONE OUGHT TO SIGNAL IF THEY WISH TO SPEAK MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MR MODERATOR LET'S NOT BRING IT BACK TO- THE CHAMBER AND MY COLLEAGUES FOR QUESTIONS. OR COMMENTS. ADDUCT PAN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- THE I GUESS THE QUESTION FOR- THAT'S ACTUALLY ME WHEN ASKED HERE- SUPPORTERS TO EXPLAIN. SO FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WE HAVE THE RESEARCH TECHNOLOGISTS AND WE HAVE THE- THE RATE THE RADIOLOGY ASSISTANCE BUT NOT. THE LEAST THAT I CAN TELL FROM THE TESTIMONY ANALYSIS IS ACTUALLY. WHAT IS WHAT CAN THE ASSISTANCE TO THAT THE TECHNOLOGIST CANNOT SO WHAT IS THE DISTINGUISHING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHAT THE ASSISTANCE SO WE HEAR THAT YOU KNOW THE SUBSISTENCE AND MORE ADVANCED VERSION OF THE TECHNOLOGIST. AND OF COURSE CERTAINLY IS A POSITION I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE NO NEW DANCES AND SORT OF IMAGING AND SO FORTH. BUT CAN WE CLARIFY AND THOSE SORT OF FLY BY THE OPPOSITION WHAT IS THE ASSISTANT DOING THAT THE TECHNOLOGIST CANNOT THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CLEAR. THAT TO DO THE- AT- THE DOES THIS BILL STRANGE ADDRESS IN TERMS OF- TRYING TO PROTECT. THE- THE NAME SO. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR THE QUESTION A REFER TO MY- EXPERTS YES. FOR EXAMPLE THE FOR EXAMPLE DOCTOR CANOPY RADIOLOGICAL FIFTEEN- WINNER THIRTY CAN CAN HELP. THE IN BETWEEN IN WHICH THE PATTERN BUT THIRTY WILL GO- I WAS THE FIRST TO BOB. B. LEGISLATION VERY CLEAR WE GET THIS. I TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WENT TO THE DOCTOR THE THEY WERE GOING TO OPPOSITION. AND WE'RE WORK CLOSELY WITH THE RADIO. AT AT IF YOU COULD AND THAT'S WHY DO WE- THAT THEY WERE BROUGHT ON BOARD BUT. OUR LADY WORK 50% SENATE ROTH ABOUTWOULD HAVE RESPOND. PERCY SO HERE LIKE THE BALLOT JUST IS LICENSED UNDER A LOT OF READY USING QUICKBOOKS- THEY ARE NOT REALLY YOU KNOW WHAT IT SCOPE OF TO DO ANY OTHER- THERE'S A COUPLE PAY. DISCUSS EXAMINATIONS. OF PERFORMANCE OF. ANY INTERVENTIONAL PROCEDURES SO THE ARE A IS A BAND PRACTICE FOR THE SKILL SETS ARE TAUGHT. AND- EXPERIENCE WITH CLINICAL PRECEPTOR SHIP. DAHLE REALLY BROADENS WHAT IN ARE A CAN TO TERMS OF REPLACING THE RADIOLOGISTS FUNCTION. SO THEY'RE MORE AKIN TO A RESPECT FOR THE A SPECIFIC TO RADIOLOGY. OKAY AND JUST TO CLARIFY BECAUSE THE OPPOSITION SAID THAT WITH THE R. EIGHT V. DOING ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES LIKE ADMINISTERING MEDICATION OR OTHER TYPES OF THINGS ARE NOT. I DON'T BELIEVE THEIR MINISTRY. MEDICATION THERE IS A- IS A LIST OF SERVICES THAT ARE PART OF THIS NATIONAL OCCASIONALLY RIGHT TO YOU. BUT IT IS VERY CONTRAST MEDIA IS SOMETHING THAT ARE HE COULD YOU CAN ALREADY WOULD DO AS WELL BUT THERE ARE MINOR CONVICTION PROCEDURES THAT ARE IS TRYING TO TEACH. OKAY- THEY'RE NOT PRESCRIBING. OKAY THEY'RE NOT INVESTORS CLARIFIED THAT THEY ARE NOT FIGHTING MEDICAL. OKAY BY NO THAT'S VERY HELPFUL I THINK COULD BE GOOD TO HAVE CLARITY ON THAT- CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'D WANT TO. HAVE BE SURE PEOPLE ACTUALLY IDENTIFYING THEMSELVES AND THAT WE DON'T- THE SEARCH FOR PATIENTS AND SO FORTH- IT'D BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME MORE CLARITY BUT I THINK THIS IS CERTAINLY. IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD AND- APPRECIATE THE ANSWERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENTIMENT. THANK YOU MR SO AND CONTINUING ALONG THE LINES OF CENTER PANIC AS I'M A LAYMAN- AND SO. YES MY QUESTION IS A LIMIT. THAT BY INTRODUCING A NEW STATUTORY SCOPE OF PRACTICE I'M STILL UNCLEAR WHAT EXACTLY WHAT WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE A PARTICULAR IN THIS CASE WITH REGARD TO EITHER QUALITY OF CARE OR COST OF CARE DESPITE AYE I'VE MISSED IT- AND I APOLOGIZE- IF IT'S BEEN CLEAR TO THEM. ROTHA BY MAPPING RESPOND AS WELL. PLEASE YES PLEASE DO SURRENDER WHAT THANK YOU FOR NEWMAN AT AN EXCELLENT SO- THIS IS WHY PRESTON AND BALAJI HAS BEEN ENHANCED. BURKE IMAGES THAT RADIO HAS TO. IT A SECURE THAT EXPEDITION CREATES. THEY ARE CURRENTLY USED. TIMES STAFF LIKE A P. A R. AND HE DOES. BUT WHAT ARE EAGER IS THAT BACK IN RADIO SAFE AND THE BACKGROUND IS A RETAIL. TECHNOLOGISTS THE REALLY ENHANCES THE LEVEL OF ASSISTANCE TO GET BY. AND THEIR ADVANCED TRAINING CERTAIN THE KRIMS ON LOMA LINDA AS OUR PROGRAM FOR OVER TWENTY YEARS. AND UNFORTUNATELY OUR REYES THAT COME FROM THAT PROGRAM. CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PRACTICE THE FULLEST OF THEIR TRAINING SO WITH THIS BILL ALLOWS. THE RADIOLOGIST TO CORPORATE IMAGE THEIR PRACTICE. SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT I THINK AT LEAST. ONE OF THE- SOMETHING'S FALLING HERE SO ONE OF THE PREMISES BILL IS THAT THIS WOULD PRECLUDE. PROFESSIONALS WHO UP TO NOW HAVE HAD A ROLE IN THE CONTINUED CARE OF DOING SO IN THE FUTURE UNDER THIS NEW STATUTES. SURGICAL EXPLAINED IS THAT THERE IS. NOT CLEAR TO ME WHETHER THERE'S A NET BENEFIT TO THAT- AND SO STILL NOT A A LITTLE MORE LIGHT ON THAT ARE GONNA BE GRATEFUL. IT DOESN'T IT DOES NOT PRECLUDE. THOSE WHO ARE DOING WHAT THEY DO NOW. WHAT IT ALLOWS THEY ALLOW IT THIRTY OTHER STATES. IS THAT THE R. HAYES WILL BE ABLE TO WORK. IN A MORE ADVANCED WAY WITH THE RADIOLOGIST IN TERMS OF THE SYSTEM IT'S NOT BEING DONE IN CALIFORNIA PARKING PLACE AND THIS ALLOWS IT TO BE DONE- AND OVER. OVERWHELMED RADIOLOGIC PRACTICE BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF A THIRTY OTHER STATES THAT THE BANDS OF JOBS AND HAVE A RADIOLOGIC ASSISTANT. M- IN THEIR IN THEIR JOB AND ALLOW THEM TO FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE. THE MOTOR RADIOLOGY SHOULD BE FOCUSING AND CONCENTRATING ON. THANK YOU MR IS THE DISPLACEMENT. YOU KNOW HOW DO I CHANGE YOU KNOW ONE R. EIGHT CANADAPART OF DEBATE WE HAVE THIRTY ARE KEY. THOSE ARE KEYS COULD YOU TO AS A HAVE. MISPLACE OF. THANKS MISTER THANK YOU- SENATORS CENTER MAN. I WANTED TO JUST FOLLOW UP ON CENTER NEWMAN'S FINAL QUESTIONING- I ALSO THE LAY PERSON I'M NEW TO THIS COMMITTEE- AND I GUESS WHEN I THINK OF OCCUPATIONAL BARRIERS TO ENTRY- MY DISPOSITION ESTATE GENERALLY NOT FAVOR THESE UNLESS THERE'S SOME STRONG REASON TO DO THAT. IN SO I GUESS I'M I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE COST BENEFIT RATIONALE THIS I CAN UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE COST POTENTIALLY A I ASSUME THIS WOULD DRIVE UP MEDICAL COSTS- IT MIGHT LEAD TO SHORTAGES IN THE NUMBER OF OUR IS WE HAVE. A BUT WHAT I'M-HAVING TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING IS WHAT THE BENEFITS ARE I GET THE ARGUMENTS FROM RIGHT WANT THIS BUT I HAVE THERE BEEN ANY ATTEMPTS TO QUANTIFY OR EVEN PROVIDE QUALITATIVE MEASURES OF WHAT THE BENEFITS OF THIS WOULD BE FOR- MEDICAL QUALITY OF CARE FOR PATIENTS FOR TAXPAYERS FOR ANYONE ELSE- I I'D BE VERY INTERESTED TO HEAR THAT. THANK YOU. SO SOUTHERN METHODIST SPONGEBOB ACKERMAN AGAIN SO. I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BE THIS IS DRIVING UP THE COST OF CARE BECAUSE THE PERSON WE DISPLAY CERTAIN HERBS WORK QUICKLY ALEX. WHICH A PROBABLY MORE EXPENSIVE COST HERE AND ALL RIGHT. PLEASE EXPENSIVE SO IT MAKE IT. RAILTRACK'S CORPORATIONS DOESN'T RESEARCH THE COST FOR THIS PURPOSE AND OF BUILDING A RE. WE ALLOW THE R. EIGHT PROVIDE OUR BUNCH OF THE RADIOLOGIST AND DIRECTOR OR ACTION AN ASSESSMENT THINGS THAT ARE ARE KEEPING BE. HAVE THEIR BEEN ANY STUDIES OR RESEARCH HAS TAKEN A ANYTHING YOU CAN POINT TO IT I JUST BE CURIOUS AGAIN ONE OF THE BENEFITS. FROM JUST FROM A PURE QUANTITATIVE PERSPECTIVE WITH THIS PROVIDES LIKE. YOUR TOWN I THINK THAT'S A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT ARE REYES WOULD LOWER THE PROSPECT BUT HAS ANYONE ELSE AT THIS. FINALLY VANGUARD. FOR BUT I GOT IT RIGHT LOOK FOR A STUDY BUT REALLY THAT COLLABORATION HEARD OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS BETWEEN ONE PM ET OURSELVES THE BILL'S BENEFIT IN TERMS OF PRODUCTIVITY AND EFFICIENCY- AND I'D BE HAPPY TO TRY TO FIND YOU SOMETHING TO THE EXTENT THAT WILL HAVE TO FIGURE TIPS BUT- THE- BEEN DONE. IN MANY OTHER STATES HER. MANY YEARS. WITHOUT WE WELCOME DATA COST PERSPECTIVE. THANK YOU TO BE VERY INTERESTED IN THAT ANY DATA THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR. A CENTER JONES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I AT EIGHT CENTER MEN'S CONCERNS ABOUT THE BARRIERS TO ENTRY I SHARE THAT pMY CONCERNS ON THE CONTINUING EDUCATION EARLIER AND THE IN THE LEGISLATURE INSERTING OUR INFLUENCE INTO THESE MATTERS- YOU KNOW I THE LEGISLATURE EVEN I TAKE A MORE RESTRAINED POSTURE- IN THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WHEN IT COMES TO TITLE PROTECTION AND EVENTUALLY EVENTUALLY LEADS TO LICENSING CALIFORNIA HAS THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF LICENSED PROFESSIONS IN THE COUNTRY. AND IS THAT JUST UNDERSCORES YOU KNOW MY-PERSPECTIVE THAT WE NEED TO BE VERY VERY THOUGHTFUL AND SET A HIGH HURDLE- ON THESE TYPES OF ISSUES GOING FORWARD IN LICENSING OR- TITLE RECOGNIZING EVEN MORE PROFESSIONS THERE'S NOTHING IN CURRENT LAW THAT WE ARE EXEMPTS SOMEBODY FROM CALLING THEMSELVES A- RADIOLOGICAL AS- ASSISTANT- SO I CAN SHARE THE CONCERN OF WHAT PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE. BUT WITH ALL THAT SAID- EVEN IF HIS DID- RISE TO THE LEVEL AND JUMP THE HURDLE OF. BEING NECESSARY REQUIRED. FOR CALIFORNIA THE PENALTY ALONE IN THIS BILL. REALLY CAUSES SOME CONCERN THAT WE'RE GOING TO JAIL PEOPLE. FOR VIOLATING THIS POLICY OR FIND THEM UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WHILE THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS. LEADING OTHER. MORE EGREGIOUS. CRIMINALS OUT OF JAIL- I'M I'M REALLY STRUGGLING WITH THAT PENALTY PROVISION OF THE BILL THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR COLLEAGUES ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS CENTER MELINDA'S. I THINK YOU MISTER CHARGES HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE BILL AUTHOR BECAUSE AS- AS- COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS CAME OUT NOW I'M A LITTLE MORE CONFUSED IS THE GOAL OF THE BILL TO. REMOVE LIMITATIONS ON THE SCOPE OF PRACTICE FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS IS THAT THE GOAL OF THE BILL. OTHER THAN YOU KNOW THAT THE TITLE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE HERE. IF YOU RECALL WHEN MY MADE MY PRESENTATION I TALKED ABOUT THE SAFETY. OF AND AT HIGH LEVEL OF SAFETY WHEN IT COMES TO RADIATION. AND THE FACT THAT- SOMEONE WOULD HAVE THE SPECIALTY AS A RADIOLOGIST SYSTEM TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AT THE HOSPITAL TO PROTECT THE RADIOLOGIST AND THE PATIENT- TO BE CERTIFIED TO DO THAT EDUCATED TO DO THAT BUT THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. AND IT AND SOMEONE WHO IS CALLING THEMSELVES THAT RADIOLOGIST ASSISTANT WHICH IS NOT TRAINED NOT AUTHORIZED THAT'S WHERE THE PENALTY COMES IN. BECAUSE WE HAVE TO PROTECT THE CONSUMERS IN THIS OPENS THE DOOR TO THAT AND- THE DIAGNOSIS THAT I MENTIONED THE RADIOLOGISTS- SITTING WITH THE PATIENT AND THE DOCTORS- THAT IS IN THE REALM OF THE OF THE RADIOLOGIST BUT THE SYSTEM. IS TO DO HIS OR HER JOB TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO MAKE SURE THAT ANYONE WHO CALLS THEMSELVES A RADIOLOGIST ASSISTANT. HAS IT HERE TO THE LAW ON THE PRACTICE AND THAT'S WHY THE VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IS WORKING IN THAT SAME DIRECTION AS WE ARE. TO ALLOW THEM TO COME IN AND PROTECT OUR VETERANS AND EVERYONE ELSE SO WE WILL TAKE ANY AMENDMENTS IN THE FUTURE I'D LIKE TO SEE THIS BILL GO FORWARD. SO THEN WE CAN MAKE SURE THE CONSUMER IS WELL PROTECTED. THANK THANK YOU CENTER CENTER EGGMAN. THANK YOU- YEAH I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH A LOT OF- MEDICAL TECHS AT FORT SAM HOUSTON WHEN I WAS GETTING MY MEDICAL TRAINING AT AS FAR AS I KNOW THAT THE MILITARY HAS NOT THAT QUANTIFY. THE PROTECTION THAT YOU COULDN'T NAME YOURSELF SOMETHING THAT OTHERS CAN'T- AND I GUESS I KNOW I'M OFFER TRAVEL PROTECTION BUT I JUST DON'T CREATING NEW ONES RIGHT NOW WE KNOW THERE'S A DEARTH OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS PROFESSIONALS AND A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE NEED TO HELP OUT AND THINGS LIKE THIS. AND I GUESS JUST AS AN ASIDE TO THIS COMMITTEE CAN HEAR THAT BECAUSE PEOPLE MAY NOT KNOW THAT THERE IS NO TITLE PROTECTION FOR SOCIAL WORKERS RIGHT A MASTER'S DEGREE IN SOCIAL WORK PEOPLE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE PHD BUT THERE IS NO TITLE PROTECTION IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW. TRIED BEFORE ALL TRY AGAIN BEFORE WE'RE DONE HERE BUT IT SEEMS TO ME OF SOMEBODY WITH A MASTER'S DEGREE IN A PROFESSION DOES NOT HAVE THE PROTECTION TO CALL THEMSELVES A SOCIAL WORKER AND NOT TO HAVE ANYBODY ELSE WHO MIGHT HAVE A JOB WITH THE TITLE OF SOCIAL WORKER CALL THEMSELVES AT. THAT I DON'T KNOW THAT WE NEED TO BE CREATING HOLDING OUT CATEGORIES AT THIS TIME DURING A PANDEMIC FOR A RADIOLOGIST ASSISTANT BURST A TECHNOLOGIST THOSE ARE MY CONCERNS. THANK. YOU CENTER ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- MISTER CHAIRMAN WE ADDRESS THAT QUICKLY. YES PLEASE. NOW APPROPRIATE TIME PEOPLE'S WORKERS HOWEVER ARE STILL ALLOW. PRACTICE OF THE FULLNESS OF THEIR PER WHAT THIS DOES IS WHAT IT ALLOWS YOU AND WHAT YEAR'S AT THIS WE WERE GOING TO DO MY JOB. AND THEN OUT NOT DO LIFE INSURER TO DIG VITAL PROTECTION AND THAT. BECAUSE BUT BELIEF IS THAT BY RECOGNIZING. YOU CAN. THEY CAN DO WHAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO DO NOW BUT OFFERING WHICH IS TO BE RECOGNIZED AS THEY ARE BUT THE OTHER STATES. TO ASSIST RADIOLOGY. ON THOSE TASKED WITH WHICH THEY ARE SPECIFICALLY QUALIFIED FRAME. AND ALLOW THOSE RADIO. GREAT ON OTHER RESPONSIBLE. IT WILL MAKE IT WILL MAKE THEIR POCKETBOOK. EIGHT EIGHT MORE OPPOSITION AND ALLOW HIGHER MEDICAL DOCTORS. THE FOCUS AND CONCENTRATE ON WHAT THEY- AND THEY WORK ONLY ONLY. THE SUPERVISION HELLO RADIOLOGIST. THANK YOU LET ME ASK IF I SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP LET ME ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS- I I'M OBVIOUSLY- I TRY TO BE SUPPORTIVE OF BILLS MOVING THROUGH THIS COMMITTEE. I'M CONCERNED THAT HAVE BEEN N A VARIETY OF WAYS OVER A VARIETY OF YEARS WITH BARRIERS TO EMPLOYMENT THAT WE- PUT UP HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE AND PARTICULARLY HERE GIVEN THE DEMOGRAPHIC THAT WE'RE ON DEADLY DEALING WITH. SO WHAT'S THE COST OF THIS TRAINING IN THE COST OF THIS EXAMINATION- THAT ARE APPARENTLY REQUIRED IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS REALLY REALLY. RADIOLOGICAL ASSISTANT- DESIGNATION AND TITLE. I DON'T KNOW THE SPECIFIC COST OF THE TEST. BUT I WILL TAKE IN TERMS OF BARRIERS. NOBODY WHO'S WORKING ON THE JOB THEY WANT TO RIGHT NOW AS A TECHNOLOGIST IS IN. IF AN INDIVIDUAL WANTS TO BE A RADIOLOGIC ASSERTS. SO WHAT'S THE COST OF THE AS SOON AS TRAINING THAT'S REQUIRED AND PRIOR TO AN EXAM. WHAT'S THE COST OF THAT. GENERAL BOB ACKERMAN I IT CERTAINLY THEY DON'T KNOW SOMEONE OR MULTIPLE IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE A TWO YEAR PROGRAM GLOBAL OFF BEFORE IT GETS CLOSED FOR YOU NOT FOR MUCH. SO IT'S A TWO BEDROOM MULLIN IS A PER PRO SO IT'S A TWO YEAR PRIVATE. THERE IS OFTEN ELSEWHERE BUT THAT BROKE THE PROPERTY CALIFORNIA. SO WHAT'S THE DRIVING AND IN MOST CASES. SO WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE IN THE AVERAGE PAY RATE BETWEEN A- RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGIST OR TECHNICIAN AND A RADIOLOGICAL ASSISTANT. AGAIN I CAN'T GIVE YOU A SPECIFIC NUMBER BUT OUR KEYS ARE FAIRLY WELL COMPETITION IN CALIFORNIA I WOULD STAY BETWEEN NINETY AND A HUNDRED AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND I THINK IT'S AN ADVANCED LEVEL R. A. YOU BE. AS THAT PICKED UP ON THE VALUE DIFFERENT BRACKET. BUT THOSE ARE NOT EMPLOYED IN CALIFORNIA. WHAT'S PURPOSES NOW I CAN'T GIVE YOU A- OR SALARY RANGER OR BORDER CROSSINGS. WELL I'LL GET TO THE BOTTOM LINE BECAUSE THIS IS THIS WILL TELL YOU WHERE I'M COMING FROM AND SHOULD THIS BILL MOVE OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE I CERTAINLY WANT SOMEBODY TO THINK ABOUT THISAND MY BASIC QUESTION IS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE PARTIES THAT ARE OUT THERE WORKING IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ONE AND TWO. ARE YOU SENATOR ARE YOU CONCERNED. ABOUT CREATING ORPHANS OUT OF THIS EXISTING. CADRE OF. RADIOLOGIC TECHNOLOGISTS AND TECHNICIANS ARE EMPLOYED IN WORKPLACES ALL UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. THOSE ARE TWO QUESTIONS AND THE REASON FOR THE QUESTIONS AS WE HAVE WE HAVE SEEN IT TO SOME EXTENT. IN THE NURSING PROFESSION WORK OUTSTANDING COMMUNITY COLLEGE NURSING PROGRAMS. TURNOUT ASSOCIATE DEGREE IN NURSING. STUDENTS BUT BECAUSE OF A VARIETY OF PREFERENCES IN THE HEALTH CARE. ENVIRONMENT HOSPITALS AND OTHERS PREFER BACHELOR'S DEGREE NURSES. AND THEREFORE CREATE DIFFICULTY FOR OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. GRADUATES OF NURSING PROGRAMS AND I'D CERTAINLY HATE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CREATE. ANOTHER RULE THAT CREATES ORPHANS OUT OF FOLKS WHO WERE WORKING DILIGENTLY IN THE HEALTHCARE PROFESSION UP AND DOWN THE STATE BECAUSE- EMPLOYERS NOW PREFER. TO HIRE RADIOLOGICAL ASSISTANCE BECAUSE THE PAY DIFFERENTIAL MAY NOT BE THAT MUCH. OVER THE OUR TEASER CURRENTLY QUALIFIED IN PERFORMING WORK. HELLO MY QUESTION MAKES SENSE DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO BE EVER RESPONDED TO UNLESS YOU CHOOSE TO RESPOND. SENATOR IF I I'VE I MAY ONCE AGAIN THE TITLE AS THE RADIO SYSTEM AND TO PROTECT THAT TITLE THAT'S THE FOUNDATION BUT ALONG WITH THAT IS THE ELEMENTS OF EDUCATION THE ELEMENTS OF A GROWTH WITHIN THE INDUSTRY. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IS THE FACT THAT THESE PRACTITIONERS ARE THERE TO PROVIDE SAFETY IN RADIATION SAFETY AND ASSISTANCE- FOR THE CONSUMER AND IF THIS BILL GOES FORWARD THEN WHATEVER AMENDMENTS THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PUT TOGETHER TO CONTINUE THE WE'RE OPEN TO THAT. BUT GIVEN THIS OPPORTUNITY WE WILL FIND THAT- ALONG WITH THE VETERANS HEALTH ADMINISTRATION ALONG WITH- LARGE- HOSPITALS AND CLINICS THAT NEEDED TO WELL TRAINED AND CERTIFIED INDIVIDUALS THAT'S WHAT THIS DOOR WILL OPEN. THANK CENTER I SEE NO OTHER MIKES UP. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND I WILL CLOSE WITH THOSE LAST COMMENTS AND RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU'RE ABLE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA- DO WE HAVE A MOTION ON SENATE BILL THREE SEVEN SEVEN CENTER MEN THOSE BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR MAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE PUBLIC SAFETY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. FILE ITEM SEVEN SENATE BILL THREE SEVEN SEVEN SENATOR ARCHULETA. THE PASS AND REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLIC SAFETY ROTH. ROTH AYE MELENDEZ. ARCHULETA LINE FOR TO LET I'D THESE. BAKER DODD I THOUGHT I EGGMAN. FOR TAUGHT AT. HIGH PHOTO ID JONES NO JONES NO LEYVA HI LEYVA EIGHT MILLION FIVE MILLION I NEWMAN. I CHAU ABODE. PAN HI CAN I. THE VOTE CURRENTLY IS- SEVEN EYES ONE NO WILL PUT THIS BILL ON CALL. HE SARGE A LETTER YOU HAVE ITEM NUMBER NINE. YES SIR SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHT FOUR PROCEED. THANK YOU- ONCE AGAIN THANKYOU- GERMAN RAFI COMMITTEE MEMBERS I AM HERE 2% SENATE BILL FOUR EIGHTY FOUR. REGARDING LICENSED PLUMBER LICENSED PLUMBING CONTRACTOR REPAIR EXEMPTIONS EXEMPTION AND I WOULD LIKE TO START BY SAYING THAT I WILL AND HAVE ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THAT WE PUT THAT ON THE TABLE RIGHT AWAY. UNDER CURRENT LAW PLUMBING CONTRACTORS ARE LICENSED BY THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSING BOARD AND ARE CERTIFIED TO PERFORM SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS. AND MAKE REPAIRS BASED ON THEIR INSPECTIONS IN THESE INSPECTIONS ARE NOW BEING REQUIRED TIME AND TIME AGAIN BY CITIES AND COUNTIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. A HOME INSPECTION BY A PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF A HOME. INCLUDED BUT NOT LIMITED TO SOME PLUMBING SYSTEMS ELECTRICAL SYSTEMS HAS SYSTEM HEATING SYSTEMS AND GENERAL MAINTENANCE PERFORMED FOR A FREE IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSFER REAL PROPERTY AND THESE DISCLOSURE REQUIRED- IN MANY FORMS OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION REALTORS. AND THE DISCLOSURES BY THE SELLER TO THE BUYER OR VITAL IN THE TRANSACTION. SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS ARE NOT PART OF A TRADITIONAL HOME INSPECTIONS SEWER LATERAL INSPECTIONS WHICH ARE INTENDED TO IDENTIFY SEWER LEAKS ARE REQUIRED BY AS I MENTIONED CITIES AND COUNTIES. AT THE TIME WHEN THE HOME WAS SOLD AND THE COUNTY RECORDER HAS KNOWLEDGE OF A TRANSFER. EXISTING LAW PROHIBITS HOME INSPECTOR A HOME INSPECTION COMPANY OR EMPLOYEE OF A HOME INSPECTION COMPANY FOR PERFORMING WORK ON ANY HOME. WHICH THEY HAVE EXPECTED IN THE LAST TWELVE MONTHS. THESE PROHIBITIONS ARE IN LAW BECAUSE HOME INSPECTORS ARE NOT LICENSED HOWEVER PLUMBER'S LICENSE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE LICENSING BOARDS ARE ALLOWED TO INSPECT AND REPAIR SEWER LATERAL. DAMAGE CURRENTLY IT IS CONSIDERED UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICE FOR PLUMBING CONTRACTED TO DO BOTH THE SEWER INSPECTION AND THE SEWER REPAIR IF THE COMPANY HAS ALSO CONDUCTED A HOME INSPECTION ON THE SAME PROPERTY. SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR CORRECTS THIS PROBLEM ALLOWS CONSUMERS MORE CHOICES AND ALLOW THEM TO BE MORE INVOLVED TO SAVE TIME SAVE MONEY AND TO REVIEW THE INSPECTION- THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE LICENSE PLUMBER. SENATE BILL EIGHT FORTY FOUR CLARIFIES THAT A LICENSED PLUMBING CONTRACTOR CAN MAKE REPAIRS TO A SEWER LATERAL PIPE. THEY HAVE INSPECTED EVEN IF THEY OR THEIR COMPANY HAS PERFORMED A HOME INSPECTION ON THE SAME PROPERTY. IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SEVEN CHIU PROVIDED AN EXEMPTION FOR LICENSE ROOF INSPECTORS SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR WOULD PROVIDE A SIMILAR EXEMPTION FOR THE SPECIALIST LICENSED PLUMBERS. SENATE BILL FORTY FOUR PROTECT CONSUMERS WHILE ALLOWING THEM TO CHOOSE A LICENSED PLUMBING CONTRACTOR TO CONDUCT THE SEWER LATERAL INSPECTION AND MAKE ANY NEEDED REPAIRS EVEN IF THE PLUMBERS COMPANY HAS PERFORMED HOME INSPECTION ON THE SAME PROPERTY IN THE PAST. FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS TODAY I HAVE TRANSMIT REPRESENTING OUR BILL SPONSORED HOME GUARD TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT VIA THE TELECONFERENCE LINE. THIS BILL HAS NO OPPOSITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTE THANK YOU JACKSON- MISTER SMITH PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS TRANSMIT ON BEHALF OF HOME GUARD SPONSOR OF THE BILL. THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS TO ADDRESS. LOOKING BODY THE WALL ONE DEALING WITH THE REGULATION OF HOME INSPECTORS- ARE UNLICENSED AND THEREFORE PROHIBITED FROM MAKING. ANY REPAIRS UNDER A HOME INSPECTION- AND THE SECOND BODY OF LAW WHICH DEALS WITH LICENSED CONTRACTORS IN THIS CASE PLUMBERS WHO ARE IN FACT ALLOWED TO MAKE REPAIRS BASED ON THEIR INSPECTION- THE PROBLEM EXISTS IF A COMPANY- OFFERS BOTH INSPECTIONS A HOME INSPECTION AND A SEWER LATERAL INSPECTION. THE MERE FACT THAT THEY'VE DONE A HOME INSPECTION ON THE PROPERTY DAMAGE LIMITS THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE A SEWER REPAIR EVEN THOUGH THERE LICENSE UNDER THEIR PLUMBING LICENSE. WE ARE NOT ALLOWING REPAIRS BE MADE UNDER THE HOME INSPECTION REPORT THESE ARE TWO SEPARATE REPORTS- WILL ONLY ALLOWING REPAIRS UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLUMBING LICENSE- IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT EIGHTY SEWER LATERAL INSPECTION IS DONE UP WITH KGO CAMERA AND S THE CONSUMER IS PROVIDED. THE EITHER VIDEO EVIDENCE OR PHOTOGRAPHIC EVIDENCE FOR THE NEED FOR A REPAIR. THERE ARE SEVERAL CONSUMER DISCLOSURES REQUIRED UNDER THE BILL WILL MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO THE CONSUMER THAT IF THEY AUTHORIZED THE REPAIR TO THEIR SEWER LATERAL- THEY ARE NOT AUTHORIZED THE HEATING REPAIRS PROVIDED UNDER THE HOME INSPECTION REPORT SO WE ARE KEEPING BOTH REPORTS- SEPARATELY AND REPAIRS ARE ONLY ALLOWED.

MISTER CHAIR NO ONE IS SIGNALED THAT THEY WISH TO SPEAK THANK YOU LET'S NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE CHAMBER. AND MY COLLEAGUES COLLEAGUES ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS DR PAN. I THANK YOU SHARE- CIRCULAR APPRECIATE- WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO BRING FORWARD I KNOW WE'VE HAD SOME DISCUSSIONS. I GUESS YEAH LEVINE MY CONCERN IS WE HAVE THE CONFLICT OF INTEREST RULES TO PREVENT- ESSENTIALLY CREATING INCENTIVES PARTICULAR FINANCIAL INCENTIVES OR SOMEONE TO. FIND SOMETHING ON INSPECTION REPORT WHICH THEM COULD AFFECT THEIR ABILITY TO SELL THEIR HOME OR THE VALUE OF THEIR HOMES BECAUSE- THE PURCHASER WOULD NOT WANT TO FIGHT YOU KNOW HAVE A DEFECT ON THEIR- AND THEN- THE SAME PERSON'S DOING INSPECTION IS ALSO DOING THE REPAIR. THERE'S PERHAPS AN INCENTIVE FOR THEM TO FIND A PROBLEM RIGHT BECAUSE THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SOME MONEY. AND WHY DO APPRECIATE THAT YOU MENTIONED THAT SOMEONE CAN TAKE A LOOK AT THE VIDEO I MEAN A LAY PERSON IS PROBABLY YOU KNOW THOSE OF A FARMER SAYS WELL THERE'S A PROBLEM THERE- IT HARD FOR A LAYPERSON SAID WELL NO THERE ISN'T AND- BY THE WAY IT'S GONNA SHOW UP ON INSPECTION REPORTS SO I AM GOING TO HAVE TO. YOU KNOW HI IS A- SELLER OF THE HOME. I AM GOING TO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO ANY PURCHASER THAT WELL ACTUALLY I DISAGREED WITH THE PLUMBER- BUT IT'S STILL INSPECTION REPORT SO BASICALLY I'M STUCK AND HAVING REPAIRED- SO CAN YOU TELL ME NOW OF COURSE AGAIN THE OTHER REASON FOR INSPECTION IS TO BE SURE THAT THE PURCHASER HAS AN ACCURATE. ASSESSMENT OF THE PER PROPERTY DEVICE SO CAN YOU EXPLAIN TO ME ASIDE FROM THE VIDEO PART. WHAT IS IT WHAT ARE THE PROTECTIONS THAT PREVENT THE ESSENTIALLY THE PLUMBER WHO IS ALSO BY THE WAY IN THIS CASE EMPLOYEE BY THE INSPECTION COMPANY SO EVEN THOUGH I DIDN'T STAND INSPECTOR THE PLUMBER TO SEPARATE PEOPLE. IF THE PLUMBER WHO IS INDEED WHO'S EMPLOYED BY THE INSPECTION COMPANY IS DOING INSPECTION REPORT- NOT HAVE A CONFLICT OR WHAT KIND OF THINGS ARE YOU DOING TO BEFRIEND BE SURE THERE IS A FINANCIAL CONFLICT BETWEEN THE PERSON DOING THE INSPECTION. AND THE PERSON DOING THE REPAIR TOOL THAT PROFIT FROM CONDUCTING THOSE REPAIRS. THAT WERE ESSENTIALLY- WELL I MEAN IN CITED BY A BECAUSE- A- INSPECTION FINDINGS SO HOW DO WE BE SURE THAT. WE PROTECT CONSUMERS AGAINST A POTENTIAL SALE BEING LEVERAGED TO THANK YOU FOR TO SERVICES THAT- THAT- WELL THAT- MAY NOT HAS TO BE WELL BASICALLY WE SAW I CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR- SOMEONE THE LEVERAGE SOMEONE TO. IT TO MAKE MONEY. CENTER I'M GOING TO GO AHEAD AND ANSWER YOUR QUESTIONS AT THE END OF THE- EXPERT HAS% ANYTHING YOU COULD DO A JUMP IN WITH. BUT AS I MENTIONED EARLIER IN THE DAY THAT ARE MY I AM A LICENSED REAL ESTATE BROKER- I HAVE REPRESENTED- NUMEROUS CLIENTS OVER THE YEARS. AND I'VE WORKED WITH NUMEROUS HOME INSPECTION COMPANIES AND- WE LOOK FOR THE MOST PROFESSIONAL MARCH FEDERAL- HOME INSPECTION COMPANY IF WE COULD FIND. AT THE REPUTATION IS ACROSS THE BOARD- IF IT'S BAD EVERYONE STAYS AWAY FROM IT IF IT'S GOOD EVERYONE WILL GO TO IT AND THAT'S WHERE THE ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. HAS ASSOCIATE MEMBERS WHO ARE IN GOOD STANDINGS THAT'S NUMBER ONE. NUMBER TWO IF THE HOME INSPECTION COMPANY IS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO EMPLOY A LICENSED PLUMBER. THAT WILL COME ON BOARD ONLY IF THE HOME INSPECTION. REVEALS THAT THERE MIGHT BE DAMAGE IN THE LATERAL LINE OR THE FACT THAT THE LATERAL LNE MUST BE INSPECTED FOR THE COUNTY OR CITY REQUIREMENT BEFORE. IT TRANSFERRED BECAUSE WE HAVE TWO SCENARIOS ONE THAT THE HOME INSPECTION TURNED ON THE WATER FAUCETS AND EVERYTHING ELSE IT IT'S SLOW THE PLAN MUST BE AN ISSUE SO SOMETHING MUST BE CAUSINGTHE PROBLEM. THAT THEY RECOMMENDED THAT THE LICENSE A PLUMBER DO. A LATERAL INSPECTION. SO THERE IS THIS CLOSE THAT THEY HAVE SOMEONE ON STAFF THAT CAN DO THAT AND REMEMBER AND I DON'T KNOW THAT YOU KNOW THIS BUT- THE HOME INSPECTION- CONSIST OF THE PLUMBING HEATING ELECTRICAL- THE AND THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES- ALL ACROSS THAT THE HOME BECAUSE- THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS IS LOOKING FOR A GOOD SOLID DISCLOSURE STATEMENT. BY THE SELLER SO IF THE SELLER HAS KNOWLEDGE OF SOMETHING BY LAW THEY HAVE TO DISCLOSE IT IF THEY DON'T. THEN THE INSPECTION WOULD DISCOVER IT AND THAT'S WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT HAVE A GOOD DILIGENT INSPECTION MADE THAT WILL REVEAL THESE THINGS SO WHEN THE HOME INSPECTION REVEALS THAT- IT MUST GO TO THE NEXT LEVEL THE EXPERT THE LICENSE- PLUMBER. THEN HE WILL FIND IT AND THEN HE'LL LOOK AT AND SIT DOWN WITH THE HOMEOWNER AND SAY THIS IS WHAT I FOUND THESE ARE MY RECOMMENDATIONS HERE'S THE VIDEO HERE THE PICTURES. AND YOU HAVE THE CHOICE TO USE THE SERVICES OF THAT PARTICULAR COMPANY OR SOMEONE ELSE AND AS YOU KNOW AS WELL AS I DO THAT ALL OF US HAVE A FRIEND OF A FRIEND. WHO IS A PLUMBER ELECTRICIAN AND SO ON SO MORE THAN LIKELY THE CONSUMER MIGHT GET ANOTHER- BID AND- OR GET THREE BIDS THIS IS WHAT'S RECOMMENDED BY THE ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS THREE BIDS. SO THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT SO THE CONSUMER ALWAYS HAS THE OPTION TO DO THAT. AND SO IN REFERENCE TO ANY CONFLICT OF INTEREST I THINK THE DISCLOSURE BY THE HOME PROTECTION COMPANY THE DISCLOSURE BY THE REALTOR HIMSELF. WITH THE FULL KNOWLEDGE THAT THIS HOMEOWNER HAS THE OPTION TO GET THREE BIDS I THINK THERE'S A PROTECTION THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR. BUT AGAIN THE CONSUMER PROTECTION IS WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR IN THE COURSE OF BEING ABLE TO. MEET THAT STANDARD THAT THE CITY OR COUNTY HAS PUT ON THE TABLE AND NOT ALL OF THEM DO NOT. ALL OF THEM DO. BUT WHEN IT'S REQUIRED THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO IT WITH A LICENSE- PLUMBER. SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING THAT- MY- EXPERT LIKE TO ADD- PLEASE JOIN IN. SURE MISTER CHAIRMAN OKAY WE HEAR THIS IN THE ENTRENCHMENT- THE ONLY OTHER THING I WOULD ADD AND AS REMEMBER BECAUSE OF THE COMPANY OF THE LICENSED PLUMBER- THERE IS ADDED CONSUMER PROTECTION THAT IF THEY FEEL THERE IS ANYTHING FRAUDULENT GOING ON A REPAIRS ARE BEING RECOMMENDED. OR NOT WARRANTED AND AGM FILED COMPLAINTS OR THEY CAN CHECK IN ADVANCE- WITH ON THAT COMPANY TO SEE IF THEY HAVE COMPLAINTS FILED AGAINST THEM AND THE BALL'S MONTHLY THE STATE CONTRACTORS BOARD DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO FIND THE FOUNDER REVOKE A PLUMBER'S LICENSE THAT THEIR- ACT THE FRAUDULENTLY SO THERE IS THAT ACT THAT ADDED. BENEFIT OF KNOWING IN A LICENSE AND TO THE IS BEING REGULATED AND OVERSEEN BY. STATE AGENCIES. OKAY CERTAINLY A UNDERSTAND THAT THE FORMER DEBTS LICENSE SERVICES TO- MAINTAIN THEIR LICENSE- I AM CONCERNED THAT- UNLESS THERE'S SUFFICIENT WORKER PROTECTIONS THAT- IS THAT SUMMER'S ACTUALLY AN EMPLOYEE OF THE SAME COMPANY THAT'S CONDUCTING THE INSPECTION THAT SO THEY'RE BOTH INSPECTOR ANDERSON THE PERSON OFFERING TO FIX SAID THERE IS NO POTENTIAL CHALLENGE UNLESS- YOU KNOW. CONFLICT THERE AND UNLESS. FOR SOME REASON THE PLUMBER- WELL GUESS THE- THE QUESTION IS THAT WITH THE SAME COMPANY THAT STATE INSPECTION ALSO THEN PROFIT BY HAVING THE REPAIR DONE BY THEIR OWN PLUMBER TODAY IN FLOYD I THINK IT'S STILL STILL BIT PROBLEMATIC BUT I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION CERTAINLY AYE YUP BOW TO YOUR SUPERIOR EXPERIENCE IN REAL ESTATE I'VE- PERSONALLY FEEL OF COURSE THAT BIDEN TOLD A COUPLE HOUSES AS AND IN MY LIFETIME- NOT NOT TO USE SLF BUT I AM CONCERNED ABOUT KNOWING HOW IMPORTANT INSPECTOR REPORT IS- TO SELLING A HOUSE- I DO HAVE CONCERNS BUT THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR ANSWER. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN COLLEAGUES- I WOULD REMIND YOU WE ARE NOWAFTER THE HOUR OF TWELVE NOON WE HAVE ALL TURNED INTO PUMPKINS SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WITH QUESTIONS AND THOSE OF YOU RESPONDING I WOULD APPRECIATE IT IF YOU WOULD BE AS CONCISE AS POSSIBLE WHILE GETTING THE INFORMATION THAT YOU NEED IN ORDER TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION SENATOR NEWMAN- ANYTHING CHURCHILL CENTER PROJECT YOU DONE MY WORK FOR ME TODAY- AND I'M HAVING ONE OF THE STATION REMOTE DIGITAL MOMENTS IT WAS ACTUALLY TWENTY SEVENTEEN- HE AND I WERE BOTH ON THE SAME COMMITTEE AND WE HEARD AB THIRTEEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH ACTUALLY. PERTAIN TO ROOFERS AND I THINK PROBABLY COINCIDENTALLY- THE SPONSOR WITH THE SAME COMPANY AS TODAY I SHARE SENATOR PANTS CONCERNED- ABOUT THAT NOT JUST CONFLICT OF INTEREST BUT THE ISSUE PROVIDING THE ASSURANCE TO CONSUMERS THAT THEY'RE NOT SUBJECT TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN A PARTICULAR AT A MOMENT. THAT IS- YOU KNOW THE END OF SORT OF. WITH RISK AND A BIG- IF FROM- PEOPLE MOST FAMILIES- AND SO I HAVE MISSED GIVE. NOT A THIS- BUT ABOUT THE BROADER. CERTIFICATIONS HERE THIS IS PRECISELY WHY IN CALIFORNIA. WHEN YOU HAVE YOUR CAR SMOG CHECKED- THAT THE COMPANY DOING THE CHECK IS NOT ALLOWED TO DO THE REPAIRS. TO PROVIDE THAT SIMILAR ASSURANCE TO CONSUMERS- INSIDE I WILL PROBABLY STAY OF THE BILL TODAY GIVEN THAT- AND I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THIS. THANK YOU SIR AND I SEE- NO OTHER. MIKES UP NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SERRAJ LETTER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES THANK YOU THIS YEAR. ONCE AGAIN- MY COLLEAGUES THIS BILL. IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL IN REALITY BECAUSE THE FACT THAT THE CONSUMER DOES ALWAYS HAVE THE OPTION. AND IT IS ALWAYS DISCLOSED BY THE REALTORS THE HOME INSPECTION COMPANY. THAT THEY CAN'T GET- THE FINAL INSPECTION BY LICENSED PLUMBER OF THEIR CHOICE. SO THE EXEMPTION I THINK WILL- CREATE- AN AWARENESS IT WILL CREATE THE SENSE OF- OF SAFETY. WHEN A PROPERTY IS BEING TRANSFERRED. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. THANK YOU SIR DO WE HAVE A MOTION. ON AS P. FORTY FOUR. ASSEMBLY CENTER DOES.

IN RESPONSE TO THE PANDEMIC THE DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS ISSUED A WAIVER LAST ME TO ALLOW PHARMACISTS TO ORDER AN ADMINISTER COVERED NINETEEN TESTS IN THE STATE. IN AUGUST OF TWENTY TWENTY THE DCA DIRECTOR ISSUED AN ORDER WAIVING SPECIFIED PROFESSIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND AMENDING THE SCOPES OF PRACTICE OF PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACY TECHNICIANS TO ALLOW THEM TO PERFORM. WAIVED POINT OF CARE TEST USED TO DETECT SARS COMMITTEE TOO. ALONG WITH THE WAIVER GUIDANCE WAS RELEASED TO INFORM AND EDUCATE PHARMACIES PHARMACISTS AND PHARMACISTS PHARMACY TECHNICIANS OF CLINICAL LABORATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT APPLY ENTERED THE DCA ORDER. UNDER EXISTING LAW PHARMACISTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO PROVIDE CERTAIN CLIA WAIVED TESTS. THOSE ARE CLINICAL LABORATORY IMPROVEMENT AMENDMENTS CONTEST IN AN EFFORT TO INCREASE INCREASE EFFICIENCY SB FOUR OH NINE SECURES A MORE PERMANENT SOLUTION THROUGH STATUTORY CHANGES THAT FACILITATE THE AUTHORITY FOR PHARMACISTS. TO PERFORM THESE CLIA WAIVED CORBIN AND INFLUENZA TESTING IN A SAFE MATT MATTER. THE BILL FORMALIZES THE DCA ORDER AND AUTHORIZES A PHARMACIST OR A PHARMACY TO PERFORM UNDER SPECIFIED CONDITIONS ANY ASPECT OF AN FDA APPROVED TEST. FOR THE PRESENCE OF SARS COVERED TO THE VIRUS THAT CAUSES COBIT NINETEEN OR INFLUENZA THAT IS CLASSIFIED AS WAIVED UNDER THAT THE CLEAR RULES. MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES INCLUDING THOSE IN MY DISTRICT FACED SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES IN OBTAINING ACCESS TO TESTING AND VACCINES FROM THE ONSET OF THE PANDEMIC. PEOPLE TRAVEL LONG DISTANCES IN ORDER TO OBTAIN PRESCRIPTIONS TESTING AND NOW TO RECEIVE THEIR VACCINES MOST OF OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE AT LEAST ONE PHARMACIES THESE LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN KEY PILLARS IN OUR COMMUNITIES. PRE PANDEMIC AND THROUGH THE PANDEMIC HAVE SERVED AS LIFELINES TO OUR RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY IN RURAL AREAS LIKE MY DISTRICT WERE AFFORDABLE ACCESS TO QUALITY HEALTHCARE IS DIFFICULT TO COME BY. IT IS CRITICAL TO UTILIZE THIS RESOURCE AND THE HIGHLY SPECIALIZED TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE MORE PHARMACISTS TO EXPAND MUCH NEEDED ACCESS TO TESTING IN OUR COMMUNITY. THIS BILL DOES NOT EXPAND THEIR SCOPE OF PRACTICE BEYOND THE CURRENT EDUCATIONAL REQUIREMENTS HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE MEASURE IS ANSATA GRAND WITH THE STATE BOARD OF PHARMACY.
