00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.395
THE TOPIC OF REPARATIONS

00:17:09.461 --> 00:17:10.929
BECAUSE THAT'S PART OF THE FOR

00:17:10.996 --> 00:17:13.499
WHAT FOR ME IS THE GRAY AREA.

00:17:13.565 --> 00:17:15.401
AND IN THE RESOLUTION TO TALK

00:17:15.467 --> 00:17:16.902
ABOUT THE CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT

00:17:16.969 --> 00:17:19.037
IN THE REPARATIONS THAT WERE

00:17:19.104 --> 00:17:22.007
PROVIDED TO THE JAPANESE

00:17:22.074 --> 00:17:25.778
INTERNEES DURING WORLD WAR TWO.

00:17:25.844 --> 00:17:26.245
WHICH I THINK WAS VERY

00:17:26.311 --> 00:17:28.514
APPROPRIATE BUT- THAT IS JUST A

00:17:28.580 --> 00:17:29.348
BIG TURN FOR REPARATIONS TO

00:17:29.415 --> 00:17:30.482
THE- TERMS OF SLAVERY BUT I

00:17:30.549 --> 00:17:31.450
MEAN THERE'S A REALLY IMPORTANT

00:17:31.517 --> 00:17:32.985
DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO

00:17:33.051 --> 00:17:34.653
CATEGORIES BECAUSE- WHEN. THE

00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:36.188
CIVIL LIBERTIES ACT WAS PASSED.

00:17:36.255 --> 00:17:38.123
THERE WERE MANY OF THE JAPANESE

00:17:38.190 --> 00:17:39.892
INTERNEES THAT WERE STILL ALIVE

00:17:39.958 --> 00:17:40.726
AND SO WAS A DIRECT

00:17:40.793 --> 00:17:42.795
COMPENSATION PAID TO THAT

00:17:42.861 --> 00:17:45.898
WHERE. ARE RIGHT NOW THE LAST.

00:17:45.964 --> 00:17:46.565
AFRICAN AMERICAN SLAVE I

00:17:46.632 --> 00:17:48.767
BELIEVE DIED NINETEEN SEVENTY

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:51.203
FOUR SPOKE. A TO ME THERE'S A

00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:51.770
BIG DISCONNECT CAN YOU TALK

00:17:51.837 --> 00:17:54.072
ABOUT WHY YOU THINK. THAT

00:17:54.139 --> 00:17:55.707
EXAMPLE PLIES WHY REPARATIONS

00:17:55.774 --> 00:17:58.010
ARE APPROPRIATE. SO THAT I

00:17:58.076 --> 00:18:00.479
WANTED TO BE CLEAR THAT WE'RE

00:18:00.546 --> 00:18:03.048
WE'RE NOT. AS A BODY IT MAY

00:18:03.115 --> 00:18:04.550
HAVE PERSONAL VIEWS OBVIOUSLY

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:07.519
ABOUT FORTY ACRES AND A MULE WE

00:18:07.586 --> 00:18:08.120
ACTUALLY WE'RE DOING THE MATH

00:18:08.187 --> 00:18:10.122
ON IT. BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT THIS

00:18:10.189 --> 00:18:11.690
BILL IS RIGHT THIS BILL

00:18:11.757 --> 00:18:13.725
SUPPORTS THE COMMISSION THAT

00:18:13.792 --> 00:18:16.395
WILL STUDY WHETHER THESE TYPES

00:18:16.462 --> 00:18:19.264
OF QUESTIONS. WE PLACED IN THE

00:18:19.331 --> 00:18:20.466
EXAMPLE OF JAPANESE INTERNMENT

00:18:20.532 --> 00:18:22.835
BECAUSE IT'S THE MOST MODERN

00:18:22.901 --> 00:18:24.636
DAY EXAMPLE WE HAVE OF COURSE

00:18:24.703 --> 00:18:26.138
YOU KNOW THAT THE FURTHER WE

00:18:26.205 --> 00:18:28.607
GET AWAY FROM THE INSTITUTION

00:18:28.674 --> 00:18:30.442
HAVING NOT ADDRESSED SLAVERY OF

00:18:30.509 --> 00:18:33.111
COURSE EVERYBODY DIES. THAT

00:18:33.178 --> 00:18:33.679
DOESN'T MEAN THE EFFECTS OF

00:18:33.745 --> 00:18:36.915
WHAT HAPPENED DIED AND I THINK

00:18:36.982 --> 00:18:40.152
ABOUT IN IN MY OWN FAMILY. MY

00:18:40.219 --> 00:18:41.386
DAUGHTER WHO IS A DESCENDANT OF

00:18:41.453 --> 00:18:45.524
AFRICAN SLAVES. AFRICAN

00:18:45.591 --> 00:18:48.494
ENSLAVED PEOPLE AND IN HIGH

00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:50.662
SCHOOL HAVING TO HAVE TO DO A

00:18:50.729 --> 00:18:53.298
PROJECT IN AN ON ONE SIDE BEING

00:18:53.365 --> 00:18:55.133
ABLE TO YOU KNOW A WORD

00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:56.435
IMMIGRANT FAMILY BUT BEING ABLE

00:18:56.502 --> 00:18:59.271
TO TRACE EXACTLY IN MEXICO

00:18:59.338 --> 00:19:02.107
WHERE WERE FROM RIGHT I MEAN.

00:19:02.174 --> 00:19:02.708
YOU KNOW. AND WE END UP HAVING

00:19:02.774 --> 00:19:07.179
TO SUBMIT. TERRIBLY ARE PRIVATE

00:19:07.246 --> 00:19:08.981
INFORMATION TO A DNA TEST TO

00:19:09.047 --> 00:19:10.883
TRY TO FIND THE INFORMATION

00:19:10.949 --> 00:19:13.352
BECAUSE NOBODY IN HER FAMILY ON

00:19:13.418 --> 00:19:16.822
THE OTHER SIDE COULD TRACE THAT

00:19:16.889 --> 00:19:17.990
AND I KNOW THAT COULD HAPPEN IN

00:19:18.056 --> 00:19:20.626
A NON OUT THE AFRICAN FAMILY.

00:19:20.692 --> 00:19:22.361
BUT IT TO EVEN TRY TO FIND OUT

00:19:22.427 --> 00:19:23.929
WHERE ON A CONTINENT YOUR

00:19:23.996 --> 00:19:26.365
ANCESTORS WERE FROM BECAUSE

00:19:26.431 --> 00:19:28.800
YOUR HISTORY WAS COMPLETELY

00:19:28.867 --> 00:19:30.068
ERASED BY AN INSTITUTION. IT'S

00:19:30.135 --> 00:19:33.572
PRETTY POWERFUL AND SO I'M A

00:19:33.639 --> 00:19:34.640
LITTLE BIASED IN IN THE AFFECTS

00:19:34.706 --> 00:19:38.377
OF THAT NOW. I THINK I LIKE

00:19:38.443 --> 00:19:40.379
THIS BILL AND IT'S BEEN AROUND

00:19:40.445 --> 00:19:41.480
FOR A LONG TIME THIS IS NOTHING

00:19:41.547 --> 00:19:43.515
NEW BECAUSE IT CALLS FOR

00:19:43.582 --> 00:19:45.584
COMMISSION TO STUDY THIS I MEAN

00:19:45.651 --> 00:19:46.785
I MADE AN ANY JERK REACTION

00:19:46.852 --> 00:19:49.288
BELIEVE YOU NOW YOUR PROMISE

00:19:49.354 --> 00:19:50.556
FORTY ACRES AND A MULE YOU

00:19:50.622 --> 00:19:52.658
WOULD OF THEN BUILT WEALTH AND

00:19:52.724 --> 00:19:54.993
PASS THAT ON TO GENERATIONS.

00:19:55.060 --> 00:19:56.662
THAT IS IN EFFECT AS WELL THERE

00:19:56.728 --> 00:19:58.697
IS NO BILL TWELFTH IN SO MANY

00:19:58.764 --> 00:20:00.299
OF OUR AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:20:00.365 --> 00:20:03.368
COMMUNITIES BECAUSE THERE WAS

00:20:03.435 --> 00:20:04.002
NOTHING TO START WITH THEM WHAT

00:20:04.069 --> 00:20:06.605
WAS PROMISED WAS TAKEN AWAY.

00:20:06.672 --> 00:20:08.273
AND SO THERE ARE A LOT OF A FAX

00:20:08.340 --> 00:20:08.840
I THINK THAT WE COULD TALK

00:20:08.907 --> 00:20:11.176
ABOUT BUT AGAIN THAT'S NOT WHAT

00:20:11.243 --> 00:20:13.478
THIS RESOLUTION DOES IT SIMPLY

00:20:13.545 --> 00:20:17.583
STATES WE CAN SUPPORT THE IDEA

00:20:17.649 --> 00:20:19.585
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT STUDY NESS

00:20:19.651 --> 00:20:21.253
AND COMING. UP REFEREES. RIGHT

00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:24.957
NOT. YES I'M AT BUT REPARATIONS

00:20:25.023 --> 00:20:26.959
COULD BE ADMISSIONS RIGHT AND I

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:27.559
KNOW THAT MAY SOUND SILLY WE

00:20:27.626 --> 00:20:28.994
CAN SAY THERE'S HISTORY BOOKS

00:20:29.061 --> 00:20:31.430
BUT IT SHOULD MISSION OF WHAT

00:20:31.496 --> 00:20:34.700
HAPPENED TO SO MANY. FAMILIES

00:20:34.766 --> 00:20:36.501
WERE TALK ABOUT SEPARATION OF

00:20:36.568 --> 00:20:37.970
FAMILIES AT THE BORDER RIGHT

00:20:38.036 --> 00:20:39.504
NOW AND IT REMINDS ME THIS IS

00:20:39.571 --> 00:20:41.773
NOTHING NEW IN AND US HISTORY

00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.275
AND AS AS CONCERNED AS I AM

00:20:43.342 --> 00:20:45.077
WITH THOSE KIDS WHAT HAPPENED

00:20:45.143 --> 00:20:46.812
IN SLAVE PLANTATIONS IS JUST

00:20:46.878 --> 00:20:48.847
SHOCKING AND THE EFFECTS WE

00:20:48.914 --> 00:20:50.315
KNOW NOW BECAUSE OF MODERN. YOU

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:52.117
KNOW MEDICINE BASICALLY THAT

00:20:52.184 --> 00:20:54.319
THE EFFECTS ON THAT CHILD WILL

00:20:54.386 --> 00:20:55.454
WILL AFFECT THAT CHILD AND

00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.523
POSSIBLY THEIR CHILDREN. THAT

00:20:58.590 --> 00:20:59.358
THAT HAPPENED AND THOSE EFFECTS

00:20:59.424 --> 00:21:00.859
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT DOWN YOU KNOW

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:01.627
TWO CHILDREN WHO WERE RIPPED

00:21:01.693 --> 00:21:03.562
FROM THEIR THEIR MOMS MOMS WHO

00:21:03.629 --> 00:21:05.597
BY THE WAY WERE RAPED IN ORDER

00:21:05.664 --> 00:21:07.799
TO BEAR THAT CHILD. AND SO I

00:21:07.866 --> 00:21:10.402
JUST THINK IT'S TIME IF WE WANT

00:21:10.469 --> 00:21:13.505
TO GET PASSED SO MUCH OF THE

00:21:13.572 --> 00:21:15.040
DIVISION IN THIS COUNTRY AND

00:21:15.107 --> 00:21:17.342
SUMMIT A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING.

00:21:17.409 --> 00:21:24.282
OF WHY I'M ARE THE WAY THEY ARE

00:21:24.349 --> 00:21:24.883
WE TO BE HONEST BUT THE PACKED

00:21:24.950 --> 00:21:28.020
AND I THINK WE START HERE. SURE.

00:21:28.086 --> 00:21:28.954
AGAIN WE ARE NINE FIVE SENATORS

00:21:29.021 --> 00:21:31.723
EVERY JUST AND I THINK THE CRUX

00:21:31.790 --> 00:21:32.791
OF THE THEN IS WHEN WE TALK

00:21:32.858 --> 00:21:33.358
ABOUT WHAT REPARATIONS MAIN

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:33.992
BECAUSE IF WE TALK ABOUT THOSE

00:21:34.059 --> 00:21:34.993
ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES IN THE

00:21:35.060 --> 00:21:35.861
SOCIOLOGICAL CONSEQUENCES YOU

00:21:35.927 --> 00:21:38.063
MENTION I COMPLETELY AGREE IT'S

00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:39.564
SOMETHING THAT SOCIETY NEEDS TO

00:21:39.631 --> 00:21:42.501
ADDRESS A PERSISTENT.

00:21:42.567 --> 00:21:44.336
ACHIEVEMENT GAP WEALTH GAP IN

00:21:44.403 --> 00:21:46.071
EDUCATION GAP THAT WE THAT

00:21:46.138 --> 00:21:47.272
STILL PERSIST IN THE AFRICAN

00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:49.007
AMERICAN COMMUNITY I THINK HAS

00:21:49.074 --> 00:21:50.075
ITS ROOTS IN SLAVERY I THINK

00:21:50.142 --> 00:21:52.277
IT'S VERY APPROPRIATE SOCIETY

00:21:52.344 --> 00:21:54.446
ADDRESS THAT WE ARE DOING SOME

00:21:54.513 --> 00:21:57.215
THINGS WE NEED TO BE DOING MORE.

00:21:57.282 --> 00:21:58.050
THE OF WHAT WE DISAGREE ON IS

00:21:58.116 --> 00:22:00.052
THAT ARE WHEN I READ H. R. R.

00:22:00.118 --> 00:22:01.353
FORTY THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION.

00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.721
IT'S PRETTY CLEAR TO ME THAT

00:22:02.788 --> 00:22:05.557
IT'S NOT ABOUT DECIDING WHETHER

00:22:05.624 --> 00:22:06.291
OR NOT REPARATIONS ARE

00:22:06.358 --> 00:22:08.660
APPROPRIATE IT'S DECIDING. ARE

00:22:08.727 --> 00:22:10.696
ON A METHODOLOGY FOR

00:22:10.762 --> 00:22:12.064
APPROPRIATING MONEY AND

00:22:12.130 --> 00:22:13.365
DISTRIBUTING IT YOU KNOW IT'S

00:22:13.432 --> 00:22:14.966
GONE WAY BEYOND THAT IF THERE'S

00:22:15.033 --> 00:22:15.934
AN ASSUMPTION AN HR FORTY I

00:22:16.001 --> 00:22:18.303
THINK. THAT REPARATIONS ARE A

00:22:18.370 --> 00:22:19.304
GOOD THING AND I THINK THAT WE

00:22:19.371 --> 00:22:21.273
NEED TO TAKE A PAUSE ON THAT SO

00:22:21.339 --> 00:22:22.741
I'LL BE WERE IN RESPECTFUL

00:22:22.808 --> 00:22:25.577
OPPOSITION. TO THIS BUT I JUST

00:22:25.644 --> 00:22:26.945
WANTED THE OPPORTUNITY TO SAY

00:22:27.012 --> 00:22:29.281
THAT THAT IS A NEW OCCASION

00:22:29.347 --> 00:22:34.219
WHERE 95% WERE IN AGREEMENT AND

00:22:34.286 --> 00:22:34.820

THOUGH THIS IS FOCUSING ON A

00:22:44.863 --> 00:22:46.732
DARK HISTORY IN THIS COUNTRY

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:48.734
AND EVEN IN CALIFORNIA ARE

00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:51.903
COMPLICITY IN IT HISTORICALLY

00:22:51.970 --> 00:22:52.437
BECAUSE AS MR OBERNOLTE IS

00:22:52.504 --> 00:22:55.207

HUMANIZATION OF AN ENTIRE RACE

00:23:00.045 --> 00:23:01.580
OF PEOPLE HAS LED TO A LOT OF

00:23:01.646 --> 00:23:04.316
POLICIES THAT PEOPLE TODAY WE

00:23:04.382 --> 00:23:05.317

00:23:05.383 --> 00:23:07.185
TODAY. HOUSING DISCRIMINATION

THIS CASE DISCRIMINATION WE

00:23:11.022 --> 00:23:12.357
HAVE SET PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THIS

00:23:12.424 --> 00:23:16.027
HISTORIC PATTERN. BEHIND WAY

00:23:16.094 --> 00:23:18.663
AND THE REST OF THIS STATE HAS

00:23:18.730 --> 00:23:20.332
BEEN MOVING FORWARD THOSE ARE

00:23:20.398 --> 00:23:21.967
VERY DIFFICULT QUESTIONS TO

00:23:22.033 --> 00:23:23.068
HAVE AND WHAT AN APPROPRIATE

HAPPENED IT IS A VERY HARD

00:23:31.510 --> 00:23:33.712
QUESTION BUT WE CANNOT HONESTLY

BE ABLE TO ADDRESS THE

00:23:36.414 --> 00:23:37.949
INEQUITIES IN CALIFORNIA IT

00:23:38.016 --> 00:23:38.717
WITHOUT HAVING THAT

00:23:38.784 --> 00:23:40.352
CONVERSATION IN FACT IF WE STOP

00:23:40.418 --> 00:23:42.454
TALKING ABOUT THE IMPACT ON

00:23:42.521 --> 00:23:44.689
RATES. IN POLICY THEN IT'S THE

00:23:44.756 --> 00:23:46.391

WHAT OCCURRED THERE I THINK A

00:29:20.592 --> 00:29:21.459
LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T TALK

00:29:21.526 --> 00:29:24.496

00:29:24.562 --> 00:29:25.964
OUT OF CALIFORNIA IN MANY WAYS

00:29:26.030 --> 00:29:28.600
AND THAT IT WAS VERY MUCH AN

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:29.968
IMPETUS BEHIND THE

OUR CONSTITUTION HERE IN

00:29:37.442 --> 00:29:39.978

SAME CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION

00:29:43.148 --> 00:29:43.648
IS LARGELY INFLUENCED OUT OF

00:29:43.715 --> 00:29:46.184
SAN FRANCISCO WHERE THE WORKING

00:29:46.251 --> 00:29:47.652
MAN'S PARTY HAD COME TO POWER

00:29:47.719 --> 00:29:50.088
AND DEMOCRATIC POLITICIANS. IN

00:29:50.155 --> 00:29:52.257
THE STATE WHO WHO PUT THAT INTO

00:29:52.323 --> 00:29:54.792
PLACE AND LARGELY BECAUSE THEY-

00:29:54.859 --> 00:29:58.129
THEY DID NOT LIKE. THAT CHINESE

00:29:58.196 --> 00:29:58.963
IMMIGRANTS CAME HERE AND WORK

00:29:59.030 --> 00:30:01.533
FOR LOWER WAGES. THAN

00:30:01.599 --> 00:30:02.634
THEMSELVES VERY HIGHLY LABOR

00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:07.105
INFLUENCED. INFLUENCE MOVEMENT

RECOGNIZE THE SINGS FOR WHAT

00:30:12.510 --> 00:30:13.912
FOR WHAT IT WAS I THINK WE NEED

00:30:13.978 --> 00:30:15.046
TO BRING THOSE ACCURATE

00:30:15.113 --> 00:30:17.048
DEPICTIONS OF WHAT OCCURRED

00:30:17.115 --> 00:30:18.116
THERE ARE STILL STREETS AND

00:30:18.183 --> 00:30:19.684
BUILDINGS IN SAN FRANCISCO

00:30:19.751 --> 00:30:20.752
NAMED AFTER SOME OF THESE

00:30:20.818 --> 00:30:23.021
FOLKS. WHO ADVOCATED FOR

HEAR A LOT ABOUT THAT IN IN

00:30:31.396 --> 00:30:32.931

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND I

00:41:57.748 --> 00:42:00.751
THINK THE AUTHOR. I THINK THIS

00:42:00.818 --> 00:42:02.152
IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE THAT'S

00:42:02.219 --> 00:42:03.220
VERY CONTROVERSIAL FOR A LOT OF

00:42:03.287 --> 00:42:04.788
PEOPLE AND MEN AND OTHERS

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:06.390
SENSITIVE BUT I MEAN I JUST

00:42:06.457 --> 00:42:09.126
THINK THE CHARACTERIZATION.

00:42:09.193 --> 00:42:10.027
WHAT OTHER STATES ARE DOING AND

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:12.363
I THINK LARGE THE WHAT. THEY'RE

00:42:12.429 --> 00:42:13.330
FOCUSING IN ON HIS THIRD

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:15.966
TRIMESTER ABORTIONS. AND ROW

00:42:16.033 --> 00:42:19.003
ITSELF ACTUALLY LAID OUT THE

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.804
FOUNDATION THAT STATES COULD DO

00:42:20.871 --> 00:42:22.973
MORE. IN THAT THIRD TRIMESTER

00:42:23.040 --> 00:42:24.375
TO PROTECT WHAT WHAT IS A

00:42:24.441 --> 00:42:26.710
VIABLE. FETUS AND TO HAVE THAT

00:42:26.777 --> 00:42:29.713
BALANCE. THAT REASONABLE

00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:31.348
BALANCE BETWEEN THE RIGHTS OF

00:42:31.415 --> 00:42:31.916
THE MOTHER AND THE RIGHTS OF

00:42:31.982 --> 00:42:36.186
THE UNBORN CHILD. BI&lt;c.cyan&gt; CARA&lt;/c&gt;

00:42:36.253 --> 00:42:38.022
CATEGORIZED AS RADICAL I THINK

00:42:38.088 --> 00:42:39.623
THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE A CARROT

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:40.424
CATEGORIZES RADICAL THIRD

00:42:40.491 --> 00:42:42.559
TRIMESTER ABORTIONS. I THINK

00:42:42.626 --> 00:42:43.827
THEY WOULD CHARACTERIZE AS

00:42:43.894 --> 00:42:45.162
RADICAL THE STATEMENTS OF THE

00:42:45.229 --> 00:42:48.365
VIRGINIA GOVERNOR. THAT A BABY

00:42:48.432 --> 00:42:48.933
COULD BE EVEN ABORTED EVEN

00:42:48.999 --> 00:42:51.468
AFTER IT'S BEEN DELIVERED. YOU

00:42:51.535 --> 00:42:52.803
KNOW THOSE ARE VERY RADICAL

00:42:52.870 --> 00:42:54.705
THINGS AND I THINK WHAT A LOT

00:42:54.772 --> 00:42:55.839
OF THESE STATES ARE TRYING TO

00:42:55.906 --> 00:42:57.608
DO IS RECOGNIZE WHAT A LOT OF

00:42:57.675 --> 00:42:59.610
PEOPLE ARE IS THAT. WE ARE

00:42:59.677 --> 00:43:01.045
DEALING WITH PROTECTING WOMEN'S

00:43:01.111 --> 00:43:04.181
RIGHTS BUT WERE ALSO HAVING TO

00:43:04.248 --> 00:43:04.815
RECOGNIZE THAT THERE IS ANOTHER

00:43:04.882 --> 00:43:08.352
LIFE. AT ISSUE HERE AND THAT WE

00:43:08.419 --> 00:43:09.586
DO HAVE TO ACCOUNT FOR AND ROW

00:43:09.653 --> 00:43:12.790
ACTUALLY LAID THAT OUT AND YOU

00:43:12.856 --> 00:43:15.025
KNOW THE AND SO LOOK A LOT OF

00:43:15.092 --> 00:43:17.061
THAT DISCUSSION I THINK NEEDS

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:17.628
TO HAPPEN. I THINK IT SHOULD

00:43:17.695 --> 00:43:20.130
HAPPEN AND PRODUCTIVE ANNA. IN

00:43:20.197 --> 00:43:24.768
A REASONED AWAY YOU KNOW. AS

00:43:24.835 --> 00:43:27.037
OPPOSED TO A REAL ANTAGONISTIC

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:32.276
WAY AS IT TENDS TO END UP. BUT

00:43:32.343 --> 00:43:32.876
YOU KNOW I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.145
GOING ON HERE I ALSO YOU KNOW.

00:43:35.212 --> 00:43:37.715
I FIND IT A LITTLE BIT FOR NAY

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:38.716
ROUTE TO COME IN HERE AND SAY

00:43:38.782 --> 00:43:40.117
SOME OF THOSE THINGS WHEN THEY

00:43:40.184 --> 00:43:42.019
PARTICULARLY HAVE GONE AFTER

00:43:42.086 --> 00:43:43.687

RIGHTS. THEY ARE RUNNING

00:43:48.425 --> 00:43:50.294
LEGISLATURE AND WE COULD STAY

00:43:50.361 --> 00:43:51.261
ON THE TITLE WERE IT NOT GO

00:43:51.328 --> 00:43:52.963

YOUR PERSPECTIVE A PRO LIFE

00:44:24.695 --> 00:44:27.097
GROUPS BUT VERY MUCH CARE ABOUT

00:44:27.164 --> 00:44:27.731
WOMEN WHO ARE IN CRISIS

00:44:27.798 --> 00:44:30.134
PREGNANCIES. AND SO YOU CAN'T

00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.468
REALLY HAVE IT BOTH WAYS NOW

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:34.772
CAN YOU. AND I THINK WE SHOULD

00:44:34.838 --> 00:44:35.239
WE SHOULD STAND UP FOR

00:44:35.305 --> 00:44:35.806
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF ALL

00:44:35.873 --> 00:44:37.341
PEOPLE. AND SO YOU KNOW I JUST

00:44:37.408 --> 00:44:41.345
I'D. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THE

00:44:41.412 --> 00:44:44.648
WAY THIS IS BEING CHARACTERIZED

00:44:44.715 --> 00:44:45.215
IS NOT ACCURATE AS ALL IS ON

00:44:45.282 --> 00:44:51.155
SALE. THIS CAR. ASSEMBLY THANK

00:44:51.221 --> 00:44:52.556
YOU FOR BRINGING THIS

00:44:52.623 --> 00:44:55.325
RESOLUTION FORWARD AND TO

00:44:55.392 --> 00:44:57.227
CHARACTERIZE WHAT OTHER STATES

00:44:57.294 --> 00:44:57.795
ARE DOING IS SIMPLY HAVING A

00:44:57.861 --> 00:45:01.999
DEBATE. OVER THE TIME. OF THE

00:45:02.066 --> 00:45:04.802
IT IS I THINK THE REQUEST THE

00:45:04.868 --> 00:45:06.603
REALITY IS THEY WANT TO HAVE

00:45:06.670 --> 00:45:08.005
ABORTION BAN THEY WANT TO TAKE

00:45:08.072 --> 00:45:10.174
CHOICE AWAY FROM WOMEN THEY'RE

00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:10.741
TAKING FUNDING AWAY THERE'S

00:45:10.808 --> 00:45:13.477
MANY STATES. WE TALK ABOUT THE

00:45:13.544 --> 00:45:14.812
LACK OF ACCESS HERE IN

00:45:14.878 --> 00:45:15.712
CALIFORNIA THERE SOME STATES

00:45:15.779 --> 00:45:18.015
WERE A YET TO LITERALLY GO

00:45:18.082 --> 00:45:19.783
OTHER STATE. IN ORDER TO GET

00:45:19.850 --> 00:45:20.617
THE CLOSEST MOST CONVENIENT

00:45:20.684 --> 00:45:29.693
TEST. I AND SO. AND. IF WE'RE

00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:31.261
GOING TO PROVIDE SERVICES AND

00:45:31.328 --> 00:45:32.429
SUPPORT SERVICES FOR WOMEN IT

00:45:32.496 --> 00:45:36.366
SHOULD BE THERE RIGHT AN

00:45:36.433 --> 00:45:36.934
OPPORTUNITY TO KNOW WHAT ALL

00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:39.002
THE OPTIONS ARE BEFORE THEM.

00:45:39.069 --> 00:45:41.738
AND IT'S VERY SCARY BECAUSE

00:45:41.805 --> 00:45:42.306
THIS COMING FROM THE WHITE

00:45:42.372 --> 00:45:44.174
HOUSE ALL THE WAY DOWN. THE

00:45:44.241 --> 00:45:47.177
EFFORTS TO TRY TO TAKE AWAY A

00:45:47.244 --> 00:45:47.744
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE AND

00:45:47.811 --> 00:45:49.012
THAT'S ALL THAT'S WHAT THIS

00:45:49.079 --> 00:45:50.414
COMES DOWN TO. IS EITHER WE

00:45:50.481 --> 00:45:52.216
BELIEVE IN TRUSTS WOMEN ARE NOT

00:45:52.282 --> 00:45:53.584
AND FRANKLY AND MOST OF THE

00:45:53.650 --> 00:45:54.451
STATE'S AND INCLUDING IN THE

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:56.153
WHITE HOUSE IS OUR MAN FOR

00:45:56.220 --> 00:45:57.421
MAKING THOSE DECISIONS. AND

00:45:57.488 --> 00:45:59.389
ADMITS APPALLING. AND SO IT'S

00:45:59.456 --> 00:46:01.091
EASY TO TALK ABOUT IT AS SOME

00:46:01.158 --> 00:46:03.527
KIND OF POLITICAL DEBATE AND

00:46:03.594 --> 00:46:04.261
WHAT HAVE YOU THE REALITY IS

00:46:04.328 --> 00:46:05.195
THAT WOMEN'S LIVES ARE ON THE

00:46:05.262 --> 00:46:06.930
LINE WITH HIS CHOICE IS BEING

00:46:06.997 --> 00:46:09.766
STRIPPED AWAY. AND IT WILL BE

00:46:09.833 --> 00:46:12.469
HERE IN A VERY DANGEROUS PLACE

00:46:12.536 --> 00:46:14.104
AS IT APPLIES TO LOOK TO A

00:46:14.171 --> 00:46:15.072
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE RIGHT

00:46:15.139 --> 00:46:16.874
NOW. AND SO DEBT TO SOMEHOW

00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:23.213
CHARACTERIZED AS. I THINK

00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:25.883
MISSES THE BOAT ALL TOGETHER

00:46:25.949 --> 00:46:27.451
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S WOMEN

00:46:27.518 --> 00:46:29.186
THAT ARE BEING TARGETED IN MANY

00:46:29.253 --> 00:46:31.522
WAYS THIS IS ONE OF A MINUTE

00:46:31.588 --> 00:46:32.856
WHAT ONE SIGNIFICANT WAY IN

00:46:32.923 --> 00:46:34.358
WHICH WOMEN ARE BEING TARGETED.

00:46:34.424 --> 00:46:35.826
BY THIS ADMINISTRATION AND BY

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:37.828
MANY STATES AND EVEN PEOPLE IN

00:46:37.895 --> 00:46:39.496
OUR OWN STATE APPARENTLY SO I

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:41.098
STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS AND HOPE

00:46:41.165 --> 00:46:43.167
THAT WE ALL CAN AGREE THAT A

00:46:43.233 --> 00:46:45.569
WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. IS

00:46:45.636 --> 00:46:47.371
REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT AND

00:46:47.437 --> 00:46:48.238
THAT WE SHOULDN'T BE OF

00:46:48.305 --> 00:46:51.441
INVADING THEIR PRIVACY AND

00:46:51.508 --> 00:46:52.075
THEIR ABILITY TO MAKE THE RIGHT

00:46:52.142 --> 00:46:52.609
CHOICE FOR THEM AND THEIR

00:46:52.676 --> 00:46:54.778

BRINGING IT FORWARD AND I THINK

00:46:59.216 --> 00:47:01.985
THAT MIS CHARACTERIZATIONS THAT

00:47:02.052 --> 00:47:04.488
ARE OBVIOUSLY CONTINUING SO THE

00:47:04.555 --> 00:47:06.123
