NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEES TO ORDER THE SENATE IS STILL IN SESSION BUT OUT OF RESPECT FOR THE PARTICIPANTS AT THE- PANELISTS AND FOR ALL OF YOU WHO ARE HERE TO WATCH THE PRECEDING THEY'VE ASKED US TO GO AHEAD AND START WITHOUT THEM. THEY WILL JOIN US AS SOON AS THEY ARE I'M ALLOWED TO LEAVE THE FLOOR AND THE ASSEMBLY JUST ARE GOBBLED DOWN A FEW MINUTES AGO SO WE HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS THAT ARE GOING TO BE ON THEIR WAY UP HERE AS WELL BUT OUT OF RESPECT TO ALL OF YOU WERE GOING TO GO AHEAD AND BEGIN- THE SO I DO WANT TO THANK EVERYBODY WHO'S PATRICIA PARTICIPATING TODAY I'D LIKE TO ALSO THANK. THE SENATE AND SENATOR STERN- JOINED TO A- OF. A PRESIDING- OVER THIS HEARING- LAST YEAR AT THE SUMMER OIL FIELD THE FOURTH. HIGHEST PRODUCING OIL FIELD IN CALIFORNIA. LOCATED WEST OF BAKERSFIELD IN KERN COUNTY HAD ONE OF THE LARGEST OIL SPILLS IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. THERE ARE OVER TWO THOUSAND ACTIVE WELLS AT THE SOME RECOIL FIELD OVER SEVEN HUNDRED CYCLIC STEAMING WELLS. THERE BEEN NUMEROUS OIL SPILLS OR SERVICE EXPRESSIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND GROWING CONCERN THAT CURRENT CYCLIC SEEM PRACTICES MIGHT LEAD TO MORE. OF THE SERVICE EXPRESSIONS OR SPILLS. THIS HEARING WILL LOOK AT THE SUMMER OIL SPILL IN THE SERVICE EXPRESSIONS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND THE HEARING WILL ALSO TAKE A BROADER LOOK AT OIL AND GAS REGULATION IN THE STATE. OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS JOGGER HAS FREQUENTLY BEEN. YES WE'LL SAY IN THE DOG HOUSE FOR LAX OVERSIGHT. OF THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY AND FAILURE TO ADHERE TO STATE AND FEDERAL LAW. A. B. TEN FIFTY SEVEN BY LAMAR. ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEMOND. RENAMED DARKER TO CAL JAM AND WE HOPE TO HEAR FROM THE NEW SOME ADMINISTRATION TODAY ABOUT HOW. CAL JOHN WILL BE POLISHED UP TO MAKE IT A SHINING EXAMPLE. OF THE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION OF HOW WE CAN. HOPEFULLY SET THE STANDARD FOR OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION TO MAKE SURE THAT WHATEVER WE DO IN THE STATE IS. AS SAFE AS IT CAN POSSIBLY BE. SO I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR FIRST PANEL I WOULD HAVE ASKED FOR COMMENTS FROM THE PANELISTS BUT THEY'RE NOT HERE YET SO I MAY VERY WELL ALLOW PEOPLE TO COMMENT- AT THE END OF THE PANEL TO GET SORT OF OPENING COMMENTS AS THEY ARRIVE. BUT FOR. THANKS MISTER FLORA WOULD YOU LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. OKAY THANK YOU. VICE CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE HE FOR SO FOR OUR FOR OUR FIRST PANEL WE'RE GOING TO HAVE WE'D CROWFOOT FROM THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY. THE BILL FOR. AND YOU ARE THE ONLY PANELIST THIS PANEL. WELCOME THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE FRIEDMAN- VICE CHAIR FLORA OTHER MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY AND SENATE- I AM GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY TO SHARE I HAD A HAD A BROAD LEVEL ON THE NEWS MINISTRATIONS APPROACH TO BOILING GAPS OVERSIGHT. AND THEN ALSO DETAIL SEVERAL INITIATIVES- THAT WE FIVE WE HAVE UNDER WAY. I INCREASING. THE REGULARITY OF FIELD INSPECTIONS IMPROVING OUR ENFORCEMENT AND OF COURSE ENSURING THAT OUR OPERATORS HERE IN CALIFORNIA TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR SAFELY DE COMMISSIONING THE WELLS SO FIRST PRINCIPLE CONTINUE TO PROFESSIONAL EYES AND STRENGTH AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT I'LL SAY THAT WE'RE BUILDING UPON A STRONG FOUNDATION OF IMPROVEMENTS IN RECENT YEARS- THAN DOG- I INITIATED A RENEW ALL PLAN IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT BEGAN TO IDENTIFY WHERE IT'S RULE MAKINGS ITS REGULATIONS NEEDED TO BE STRENGTHENED AND HOW IT COULD PROFESSIONAL EYES- AN IMPROVED IT'S OVERSIGHT. AND MANY IMPROVEMENTS FOR WENT MERMAID THAT WERE WERE REALLY BUILDING UPON- SO FIRST FROM CORPORATE DOUBLE STRENGTH AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT SECOND PRINCIPLE IS TO ALIGN THE DIVISION- WITH THE STATE'S A LEGAL REQUIREMENT TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND- IN THE VISION TO ACHIEVE CLIMATE NEUTRALITY BY THE MIDDLE PART OF THE CENTURY I AM REALLY UPDATING THE OF THE VISION TAKES TO FOR EXAMPLE REDUCE THE ENERGY FOOT PRINT OF EXTRACTION REDUCE FUGITIVE EMISSIONS COMING FROM EXTRACTION ETCETERA. TO IMPLEMENT THE GOVERNOR'S VISION- FOR OIL AND GAS OVERSIGHT WE HAVE TWO NEW LEADERS AND I'M PLEASED TO INTRODUCE TO YOU HERE TODAY THIS IS I THINK THE FIRST TIME THEY'LL BE TESTIFYING IN FOR THE LEGISLATURE ON THE FIRST BEHIND ME IS DAVID CHIU BAYESIAN GIVEAWAY DAVID SO YOU SEE WHO HE IS WE TESTIFYING IN A MOMENT DAVID COME TO US FROM THE SACRAMENTO AREA COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS. A COP OUT WHERE HE FOR THIRTEEN YEARS FOCUSED AT THE INTERSECTION OF LAND CONSERVE ARE FOR YOU BY FOR BOTH RURAL AND URBAN COMMUNITIES AND ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY WELL IT WILL TALK TODAY ABOUT OBVIOUSLY OIL AND GAS OVERSIGHT BUT ANOTHER CORE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION IS JUST THAT LAND CONSERVATION AND HOW DO WE- PLAN AND SUPPORT LOCAL COMMUNITIES GROWING IN WAYS THAT SUSTAIN THEIR ECONOMIC VITALITY AND ADVANCE ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY. SO DAVID BRINGS EXPERTISE ENVISIONED IN THAT AREA AND IS GETTING UP TO SPEED UP CORD ON ON OIL AND GAS. AS WELL. AND THAT LEAD. THE DIRECTLY OVERSEEING OIL AND GAS ODOR OVERSIGHT IS WHO DO ACTON TALK. ARE WHO GET COMES TO US FROM THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES WHERE HE SERVED AS OIL AND GAS US ADMINISTRATOR. WHO TO WALK IS- HAS THAT BACK EDUCATION AND CAREER AS A PETROLEUM ENGINEER SO BRINGS A HIGH LEVEL OF TECHNICAL SOPHISTICATION- AND ALSO. A LEGACY OF ENVIRONMENTAL ENGAGEMENT OUR HE WAS ONE OF ON GREEN FOR ALL ITS FELLOWS ON FOR EXAMPLE. HE'S BEEN A REGULATOR IN LONG BEACH AND- IN THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES FOR OVER A DECADE SO WE'RE REALLY QUITE FORTUNATE TO HAVE BOTH. I DAVID IN WHO TO WALK IN ANY WILL BE TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. I CHAIR FRIEDMAN YOU MENTIONED ASSEMBLYMEMBER LEE MOANS BILL TEN FIFTY SEVEN THAT UPDATED THE MISSION OF THE DIVISION OVERSEEING OIL AND GAS- WE KNOW THAT DIVISION HISTORICALLY AS DAGR OR THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES AND IT HAS BEEN RENAMED THE CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THAN THE NAME CHANGE ITS ITS MISSION HAS BEEN UPDATED ARE BOTH TO ELEVATE- THE FOCUS OF THE DIVISION ON PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AS WELL AS- THE NEED TO ALIGN THE DIVISION WITH THE STATE'S BROADER CLIMATE AND ENERGY GOALS- SO THE INITIATIVE THAT I'LL TALK ABOUT- NOW INTO ACTION JUST A MOMENT ARE REALLY BEING IMPLEMENTED THROUGH- THIS THIS DIVISION WITH ITS NEW AN UPDATED OUR MISSION I'LL MENTION THAT WE CONTINUE TO BUILD CAPACITY OF THE DIVISION- TO- SAFELY REGULATE- THIS ACTIVITY. I THINK YOUR STAFF REPORT NOTED THAT THIS DIVISIONS THE STAFF HAS HAS TRIPLED IN THE LAST DECADE WHICH REALLY REFLECTS THE NEED AND THE RECOGNITION THAT MORE STAFF IS NEEDED TO ENSURE FULL AND FAIR MEDITATION UP THE STATE'S LAWS AND REGULATIONS ON OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION. SO LET ME TURN TO. A SET UP OF INITIATIVES THAT WERE ANNOUNCED AT THE END OF LAST YEAR THAT REALLY SPEAK TO THAT FIRST PRINCIPLE OF STRENGTHENING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT AND- I'LL FOCUS ON THREE. AND EACH OF THEM REALLY IS- IT IS PRIORITIZING ADVANCING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT THAT IS SCIENCE DRIVEN. SPECIFICALLY PROTECTIVE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY AND OF COURSE ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE. AB THE FIRST REGULATORY ACTION IS A MORATORIUM THAT IS PLACED ON A CERTAIN PRACTICE OF INJECTING HIGH PRESSURE STEAM I INTO THE GROUND I HAD A PRESSURE WHAT'S CALLED ABOVE THE FRACTURE GRADIENT- THIS IS A PRACTICE WHICH WE KNOW AS A CYCLIC STEAMING ABOUT THE FRACTURE PRESSURE. THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE EXPRESSIONS THAT YOU ARE OVER VIEWED IN YOUR INTRODUCTION- A MORATORIUM WAS PLACED ON NEW WELLS- THAT WOULD INJECT USING THIS PRACTICE ON WHILE A REVIEW IS CONDUCTED BY CAL JAM AND THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY. ON THIS PRACTICE TO DETERMINE IF IT IS SAFE TO CONDUCT IN CALIFORNIA AND IF IT IS SAFE TO CONDUCT UNDER WHAT CONDITIONS IS IT SAFE TO CONDUCT- THIS HI PRESSURES SIXTEEN AND ABOVE THE FRACTURE GRADIENT. THAT REVIEW AS I SAID WHAT IT WILL BE AT A TANDEM EFFORT OF CAL JAM AND LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY AND IT IS ANTICIPATED TO TAKE UPWARDS OF SIX MONTHS ARE FOR THAT REVIEW TO TAKE PLACE. THE SECOND REGULATORY ACTION THAT WAS ANNOUNCED IN LATE NOVEMBER IT WAS AYE INITIATING A RULE MAKING ART TO IMPROVE OUR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS. ARE OF COMMUNITY MEMBERS COMMUNITIES AND- FOLKS LIVING ADJACENT TO OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION- OUR ANNOUNCEMENT MADE CLEAR THAT WE ARE STARTING A RULE MAKING WHICH IS THE WAY THAT WE UPDATE TE STATE'S REGULATIONS- FOCUSED ON. IMPLEMENTING NEW HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS- DESIGNED TO INCREASE AND EXPAND PROTECTIONS. ARE GOALS WITH THIS RULE MAKING ARE A TRUE OUR DEBT TO ESTABLISH A TRANSPARENT SET OF RULES. NOT TO UTILIZE THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND DATA. TO ENGAGE I PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITIES AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS THAT'S INCLUSIVE ARE BOTH FOR OUR COMPANIES IN OUR INDUSTRY AND COMMUNITIES ADJACENT TO THESE FACILITIES SO WE ARE PLANNING A VIGOROUS PRE RULE MAKING PROCESS WERE ACTUALLY GOING OUT ACROSS THE STATE TO SEEK OUR SOLICIT. INPUT THAT WILL GUIDE THIS RULE MAKING AND SUPERVISOR AND TALK AND EXPLAIN MORE ABOUT- PUBLIC MEETINGS THAT ARE HAPPENING IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. OUR ANNOUNCEMENT WITH CLEAR THAT WE WILL CONSIDER A FULL RANGE OF PROTECTIVE MEASURES- AND REALLY ALL IDEAS ARE ALL POTENTIAL MEASURES THAT COULD BE PUT IN PLACE- TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY- INCLUDING- THE POSSIBILITY OF- RESTRICTING OUR OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES WITHIN CLOSE PROXIMITY IS OF HOMES AND SCHOOLS INSENSITIVE RECEPTORS. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT- THAT. THEIR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME THROUGH THE RULE MAKING PROCESS WILL BE GUIDED BY AGAIN THAT BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AUTHORITIES SO I KNOW CONCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN DRAWN ABOUT WHAT MEASURES WHAT SAFETY MEASURES BOB MAKES SENSE TO INTEGRATE BUT- THAT WILL OF COURSE BE PART OF WHAT WAS DISCUSSED IN THE PRE RULE MAKING AND THEN. SUBJECT TO THE RULE MAKING PROCESS. AND I'LL MENTION THAT- THIS RULE MAKING WILL COMPLEMENT- THE COMPREHENSIVE AIR MONITORING THAT TAKES PLACE IN COMMUNITIES ARE LOCATED AT NEW OIL AND GAS OPERATIONS UNDER EIGHTY SIX SEVENTEEN. THE THIRD- INITIATIVE AGAIN FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING OUR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT- HAS TO DO WITH PERMITTING ON SPECIFICALLY PERMITTING OF WELL STIMULATION ARE WHICH IS THE TECHNICAL NAME OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING OR FRACKING AS WELL AS UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROLS OR CYCLIC STEAMING- EARLIER IN TWENTY NINETEEN. OUR CONCERNS WERE RAISED ABOUT THE PERMITTING PROCESS OF THOSE PRACTICES- AND SPECIFICALLY WHETHER- THE PERMIT PROCESS WAS BEING CONDUCTED APPROPRIATELY- BY THEN DOCTOR STAFF- THE GOVERNOR TOOK THIS QUITE SERIOUSLY. AND TOOK A SERIES OF ACTIONS- TO ENSURE THAT OUR PERMITTING PROCESS IS INDEED LEGALLY APPROPRIATE AND ABOVE REPROACH- THERE HAS NOT BEEN A- A HYDRAULIC FRACTURING PERMIT OR WELL STIMULATION PERMIT ISSUED- SINCE THOSE CONCERNS WERE RAISED. AND MOVING FORWARD WE WANT TO ENSURE THE VALIDITY OF THE PERMITTING PROCESS AND SO WE ARE. NOT TAKING TO ACTIONS- THAT WERE ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER- THE FIRST IS INITIATING AN AUDIT BY THE OFFICE OF STATE AUDITS AND EVALUATIONS WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- THAT ENTITY WILL REVIEW THE PERMITTING PROCESS FOR THESE PRACTICES. OF SOUP TO NUTS OUT IN COMING MONTHS AND WILL ISSUE A PUBLIC FINDINGS ON THE PERMITTING PROCESS AND WE HOPE I AS AS APPROPRIATE- MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS HOW TO STRENGTHEN THE PERMITTING PROCESS. WHILE THAT SAY AUDIT IS I IS TAKING PLACE- PERMITS FOR THESE PRACTICES- THAT HAVE BEEN SUBMITTED TO CAL JAM I WILL BE. INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED ON A PERMIT BY PERMIT BASIS- BY EXPERTS AT THE LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABORATORY. THE NOTION IS IN ALL FAIRNESS OUGHT TO THE COMPANIES THAT ARE THAT ARE ENGAGE IN THIS PRACTICE WHICH IS LEGAL UNDER STATE LAW. WE ARE. OPEN TO CONTINUING TO APPROVE THOSE PERMITS IF INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED- UNTIL THAT AUDIT IS BACK THAT REALLY. GET ULTIMATELY ASSESSES THE PERMITTING PROCESS MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONFIRMS THE VALIDITY OF OUR PERMITTING PROCESS THAT'S REALLY THE THIRD SET OF REGULATORY ACTIONS TAKEN PLACE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION TO CAL JAMS OUT ROLE IN THE STATE'S EFFORT TO REDUCE CRIME AND- IT GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND CARBON NEUTRALITY AND I'LL MENTION. TO ANNOUNCEMENTS FROM THAT NEWS MY MINISTRATION AND TWENTY NINETEEN- THAT REALLY RAISE THIS QUESTION OF THE TRANSITION TO OUR CLIMATE NEUTRALITY AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR OIL AND GAS SUPPLY. HI THE CALIFORNIA BERMAN PROTECTION AGENCY IS INITIATING TWO INDEPENDENT STUDIES FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ONE FOCUSED ON THIS QUESTION OF. HOW IS- IS OIL AND GAS- POLICY IMPACTED BY A DECLINE IN THE DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS OVERTIME SO REALLY THIS QUESTION OF HOW DO WE MANAGE THE DECLINE OF DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN FOR OUR SUPPLY POLICY. THAT STUDY IT HAS BEEN PUBLICLY SCOPED MEANING IT IT RECEIVED INPUT FROM STAKEHOLDERS ABOUT WHAT THE STUDY SHOULD- SHOULD FOCUS ON. AND IS GETTING UNDER WAY I BELIEVE IN COMING WEEKS A TANDEM STUDY OR COMPANION STUDY ARE ALSO OVERSEEN BY THE- CALLIE PA WILL FOCUS ON HOW WE CAN REDUCE. EMISSIONS TRANSPORTATION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE RECOGNIZING THAT'S GOING TO BE ESSENTIAL TO MOVE TOWARD CLIMATE NEUTRALITY. IN ALLOW BUDGET LAST YEAR'S BY GOV ALSO MADE A FIVE YEAR COMMITMENT REGARDING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT- TO ENSURE THAT AS OUR DEMAND FOR ENERGY CHANGES AND AS THIS TRANSITION TAKES PLACE TO REDUCE THE WARY REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS. THAT OPPORTUNITIES EXIST FOR CALIFORNIANS TO TAKE PART IN THOSE NEW INDUSTRIES AND THAT AT THIS TRANSITION TAKES PLACE NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND. WHO IS IN A WORKING IN IN WHATEVER IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES SO THAT IS A THIRTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OUT THROUGH OUR G. G. R. AFTER A GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND PROGRAMS- EACH YEAR FOR THEEXT FIVE YEARS. LET ME JUST LASTLY SAY THAT- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR SIGNED FIVE BILLS THAT FURTHER STRENGTH AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. ON OIL AND GAS AND THEN BELIEVE LAST WEEK I. WAS IN CLEAR OPPOSITION DE PRESIDENT TRUMP'S EFFORT TO EXPAND OIL AND GAS- EXTRACTION ON FEDERAL LANDS ARE WITHIN THE SOUTHERN SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. SO HOPEFULLY I PROVIDED WHAT ARE OUR OVER ARCHING PRINCIPLES GUIDING OVERSIGHT OF OIL AND GAS AND THEN GIVEN AT LEAST TOP LEVEL SUMMARY OF RECENT INITIATIVE THAT WE HAVE ANNOUNCED. AND WOULD BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT YOU HAVE. THE LONG AND SENATOR. AND THEN LET THEM ON BEHALF OF PLACES THEY WANT AND THEY TO MAKE ANY COMMENTS THE FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL FOR ME TO WATCH THE NEXT CHANNEL I WANT THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE AND- FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AND I'M VERY BY. FOCUS APARTMENT. THREE TWENTY. WHEN WE GOT ON WITH HIM AND IN GENERAL I'M VERY HAPPY TO HEAR ON WHAT SHAPING UP TO BE A VERY COMPREHENSIVE AND I THINK HOMELESS OR THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU. YOU IF YOU HAVE TO DESIGN THE WHAT BUT I HAVE A FEW MORE THAT I WILL YOU KNOW ASK SURE NOW MOVES TO MY KNOWLEDGE FIRST YOU SEE I HAVE USED THAT YOU WERE WORKING IS A LITTLE MORE ON LOOKING AT THE SCIENCE OF THAT DIFFERENT STRUCTURE AND I'M LOOKING PERMIT BY PERMIT. DO YOU ANY KIND OF UP HI AM SORRY OKAY NONE OF THAT WAS HEARD ANYBODY EXCEPT FOR YOU MAYBE EIGHT TO PEOPLE ON THE FRONT ROOM I JUST FOR THE FOLK THAT WERE ON TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHEN I SAY I WANTED I THANK THE SECOND FOR BEING HERE FOR. ADMINISTRATIONS COMPREHENSIVE AND HOLE LIKE A PRO I'M AND THE. THAT WAS PRETTY MUCH AT IT WAS A LONG WAY OF THAT I'M- TO. SEE THEM. WORK ON FULL ON THE THEY- MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE I THINK A THIS AREA YOU KNOW THE- KIND OF OUR FOR OUR- FUTURE I'M WITH REGARD TO OIL AND GAS AND CLIMB. SO MY FIRST WAS A THE WEALTHY. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT A- A MORE RIGOROUS AYE TYPER PERMITTING AND LOOKING PERMIT TO PERMIT. DO YOU ENVISION ANY SCENARIO WHERE YOU WILL EITHER SEVERELY RESTRICTED NEW PERMITS AFTER THE MORATORIUM OR EVEN JUST STOP THE PRACTICE ALL TOGETHER OR IS IT TOO EARLY TO EVEN SPECULATE. WELL FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE THE LEGISLATURE. FOCUSED VERY INTENSELY ON ON THE PRACTICE OF HYDRAULIC FRACTURING IN SENATE BILL FOR- SEVERAL YEARS AGO AND HAS ESTABLISHED YOU KNOW CLEAR LEGISLATIVE OP PARAMETERS AS IT RELATES TO THAT PRACTICE. SO OUR FOCUS HAS BEEN LAST ABOUT REEVALUATING THAT PRACTICE AND IN THIS CASE MORE ABOUT ENSURING THAT VIOLATED THE- THOROUGHNESS OBJECTIVE NOUS OF OUR PERMITTING PROCESS. SO I DON'T ANTICIPATE THAT WITHIN THESE PERMIT BY PERMIT REVIEWS OR WITH IN THIS AUDIT PROCESS. THAT WE WOULD MAKE FINDINGS PROBABLY FURTHER RESTRICTING THE PRACTICE. THIS FOCUSED ON BOTH THE SAY AUDIT AND THE PERMIT BY PERMIT REVIEW IS REALLY ENSURING THAT THE- APPROPRIATE STEPS IN THE PERMITTING PROCESS HAVE BEEN FOLLOWED. OKAY AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN REQUIRED CAL GEMS PURPOSE TO REGULATE OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION TO INCLUDE PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AS YOU MENTION OF SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY. INCLUDING REDUCTION IN MITIGATION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF HYDROCARBON AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES IN A MANNER THAT MEETS THE ENERGY TO NEEDS OF THE STATE HOW DO YOU INTERPRET THAT REQUIREMENT HOW DO YOU SEE. YOUR POLICIES ALTERING TO SATISFY- THAT DEMAND YEAH THE GOVERNOR'S TALKED ABOUT A LONG TERM TRANSITION TO REDUCING OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND- AND ULTIMATELY ACHIEVING CLIMATE NEUTRALITY AND THAT WILL OBVIOUSLY INVOLVE A TRANSITION. ARE AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS I'LL MENTION THAT OUTSIDE OF POLICY MAKING THE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND OIL AND CALIFORNIA'S ACTUALLY DECLINE SINCE THE LATE EIGHTIES- AS I UNDERSTAND IT AS A RESULT OF. MEDICATIONS AND ACTUALLY BEING ABLE TO ADD- BY THE SUPPLY BUT IN ANY EVENT OUR VISION IS THERE IS CLEARLY A TRANSITION THAT NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE. IN ORDER TO ABIDE STATE WATER REDUCE EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN THE STATE DIVISION FOR CLIMATE NEUTRALLY. THAT TRANSITION HOUSE TO BE THOUGHTFUL. AND TAKE I AM YOU SAID IT BOTH BOTH REVIEWS BOTH THOSE WORDS IN TERMS OF THOUGHT FALL. AND TAKE TIME AND THAT WE MEAN. AFTER AN WRECKED AS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF WOMEN IN CAL WORK AS AN. AND ANY TRACK XIN. ARMED THAT CHEFS OUR DEPENDENCE ON AND A SOURCE. ARE WE REALLY HAVE TO PHùON IN A- CONTINUED OPPORTUNE FOR THOSE THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHAT IS KNOWN IN. IN THIS IN THESE POLICY DISCUSSIONS AS A JUST TRANSITION- BUT THEN ALSO RECOGNIZING OUR CONTINUED DEMAND FOR OIL AND GAS IN THE STATE- AS YOU ALL PROBABLY KNOW OUR VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED IS. NOT BEING REDUCED AND HOW WE CONTINUE TO HAVE. HIGH DEMANDS FOR. GASOLINE ABOUT A THIRD OF WHICH IS PRODUCED USING CALIFORNIA A SUPPLY. OUR NEXT STEP TO REALLY NAVIGATING WHAT IS THE PATHWAY- ON THIS INTERSECTION BETWEEN- FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND AND ANY SUPPLY POLICY IS THIS INDEPENDENT STUDY AT THE UC IS INITIATING. AND THAT WILL IDENTIFY OP POTENTIAL PATHWAYS ON THAT COULD INFORM OUR SUPPLY POLICY AS WE REDUCE OUR DEMAND IN COMING DECADES- WE ARE NOT IN A POSITION NOR ARE WE DIRECTING CAL JAM TO BE IN A POSITION TO- MAKE- BLASTING DECISIONS REGARDING. OUR OIL SUPPLY- SHORT OF AN ESTABLISHED PATHWAY THAT'S THAT'S NOT TRANSPARENT AND I AND IN STUDY VERY CAREFULLY. AND I'M CURIOUS ARE THERE ANY OTHER NATIONS AND WE'RE NOT A NATION BUT ARE THERE ANY NATION'S WE CAN LOOK TO WHERE YOU FEEL THAT THEY ARE ACTIVELY TRYING TO MANAGE THAT A DEMAND REDUCTION ANY ANY GOOD MODELS OUT THERE. WELL CERTAINLY I MEAN I THINK CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN REDUCING OUR DEMAND IN THE SENSE THAT WE HAVE- ONE OF THE HIGHEST PENETRATIONS OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE'VE SHIFTED. MANY OF MUCH OF OUR ENERGY GENERATION TO FOLLOW UP ALSO FREE- OF ENERGY. I THINK THAT ARE REALLY STRONG PARTNERSHIPS THAT CALIFORNIA HOUSE WITH BASES ACROSS THE WORLD TO REDUCE. OUR FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND- MUCH MORE COMPLICATED COMPLY. QUESTION ABOUT- HOW TO MANAGE OUR OIL AND GAS SUPPLY- WHILE WE ARE WHILE OUR ECONOMY'S TO ME. THAT RESOURCE. I'M SORRY YOUR WE FIRST SO LEGISLATOR MAN MANDATE REPORTS FROM CAL JAM THE WEEK BEFORE THIS HEARING AND WE APPRECIATE THE RELEASE OF THE REPORTS AND CERTAINLY FOR OUR HEARINGS- PURPOSES IT WAS GOOD TIMING BUT MANY OF THESE REPORTS WERE ALMOST SIX MONTHS LATE AND I'M WONDERING IF YOU'RE LOOKING AT WAYS OF SPEEDING UP THE- TRANSPARENCY IN RELEASE OF INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC AND- WHAT YOU'RE DOING TO ENSURE THAT REPORTS ARE TIMELY IN THAT INFORMATION GETS OUT IN A MORE TIMELY MANNER YEAH WELL SAY. WE NEED TO DO BETTER OUR COMMITMENT IS TO GET THIS TYPE OF INFORMATION NOT TO THE LEGISLATIVE LEGISLATURE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN- IT'S OBVIOUSLY BEEN A YEAR OF TRANSITION AT THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION AND AT CAL JAM I IN SO MUCH OF OUR FOCUS WAS GETTING THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP IN PLACE IN ANNOUNCING THESE INITIATIVES ABOUT MOVING FOR IT I THINK YOU CAN AND SHOULD EXPECT- THAT MORE TIMELY DELIVERY OF INFORMATION THAT YOU REQUEST. THANK YOU NOW ALL TURNED TO A MY- FELLOW MEMBERS- IS THE AMOUNT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I THINK YOU SECRETARY CROWFOOT FOR YOUR PRESENTATION- A COUPLE QUESTIONS OF ITEMS THAT YOU'VE TOUCHED ON AND FIRST YOU TALK YOU MENTIONED THE MORATORIUM. AND THE ANNOUNCEMENT THAT CAME LAST. SUMMER IT IN A YOU KNOW AS A RESULT. OF SOME OF THE CONCERNS- I FROM THE ADMINISTRATION AND OTHERS IN OUR STATE. THE MORATORIUM SPECIFICALLY AS- IT IS RELATED TO STEAM INJECTION- AT BUT IT DOESN'T COVER ALL TYPE OF THE- STEAM INJECTION SO. CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY THE LOW PRESSURE- WAS NOT COVERED UNDER THE MORATORIUM OR WITH THE THOUGHTS ARE FOR YOU KNOW WHERE THE MORE TRAIN WAS REALLY ABOUT PARTIAL USE NOT VERSE IS NOT FULL. YEAH ABSOLUTELY SO THE MORATORIUM ON HIGH PRESSURE STEAM INJECTIONS ABOVE THE FRACTURE GRADIENT. INTENSELY FOCUSED ON THIS CHALLENGE THAT THE STATE IS HAVING WITH SURFACE EXPRESSIONS OR SO CALLED OIL SPILLS WHERE THERE IS UNPREDICTED ON TROLL OIL BUBBLING UP TO THE SURFACE. OUR TECHNICAL STAFF AT JAM BELIEVE THAT THERE IS AN ASSOCIATION IN AT LEAST SOME OF THE OIL FIELDS ARE BETWEEN THIS HIGH PRESSURE STEAM INJECTION ABOUT THE FRACTURE GRADIENT AND THOSE UNCONTROLLED UNPREDICTED OIL SPILLS. REGULATIONS THAT TOOK EFFECT LAST APRIL- SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT SURFACE EXPRESSIONS. AND INSTITUTED NEW RULES TO ELIMINATE SERVICE EXPRESSIONS DESPITE THOSE STRONGER REGULATIONS AS OF APRIL WE EXPERIENCE THIS SPATE OF SURFACE EXPRESSION THROUGHOUT THE SUMMER INCLUDING THE LARGEST. OIL SPILL LAND BASED OIL SPILL IN IN IN RECORDED HISTORY IN THE STATE THE SAME RECOIL SPELL THAT YOU HEAR MORE ABOUT. AS A RESULT OF THAT. OUR TECHNICAL STAFF A CAL JAM ARE RECOMMENDED A MORATORIUM ON THIS PRACTICE ON UNTIL AN INDEPENDENT REVIEW. PLACE I'M- OUT CHEN BUT WITH LAWRENCE LIVERMORE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND IF THAT PRACTICE OF HIGH PRESSURE STEAM INJECTIONS BUT THE FRACTURE GRADIENT CAN BE CONDUCTED SAFELY IF. AND THEN IF IT CAN BE CONDUCTED SAY. WHERE AND HOW IT CAN BE. CONDUCTED SAY. OUR OUR WILL OR ACTUALLY A RESPONSIVE IS TO A LIMB SURF EXPRESSIONS TO ELIMINATE THESE UNCONTROLLED UNPREDICTABLE- LAND BASED OIL SPILLS ARE MORATORIUM HELPS US GET WE BELIEVE GET A HANDLE ON WHETHER THAT PRACTICE IS ESSENTIALLY PART OF THE PROBLEM. AND MORE TRAM AGAIN IT WAS PARTIAL AND I'M JUST CURIOUS WHY THE IT WAS INCLUDED IT WAS IT JUST BECAUSE IT WAS A RESPONSE TO THIS IMMEDIATE OIL SPILL OR WAS IT BECAUSE THERE IS GREATER RESEARCHER CITY THAT'S GOING TO BE DONE ON LOW PRESSURE. SUPERVISOR IN TALK AT A PETROLEUM ENGINEER WILL BE ABLE TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION MORE INTELLIGENTLY THAN I WILL BUT I WILL SAY. THAT THE PRACTICES OF CYCLIC STEAMING BELOW THE FRACTURE GREAT IN AND SEPTIC STEAMING ABOVE THE FRACTURE GRADING WE'RE ACTUALLY BREAKING SUBSURFACE OP- ARE TWO DISTINCT PRACTICES AND IT FELL OUT- ABOVE THE FRACTURE IN WHERE IF OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTS HAVE THE MOST CONCERN LEADING THE FOR SERVICE EXPRESS. Q. AND THE OTHER PIECE THE I WANTED TO AND ARE CHAIR AT TO TOUCH A LITTLE BIT ON IT WAS THE C. C. S. T. S. SUMMARY. AND IN ADDITION TO JUST THE TIMING OF IT I'M ACTUALLY- WANTING TO KNOW WHAT THE NEXT STEPS ARE FOR THE DEPARTMENT IF THERE'S ANY THOUGHTS- THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER FIVE THOUSAND OIL WELLS IN CALIFORNIA- THAT. THAT TO US WE COULD END UP PLAYING THE CLEAN UP COST FOR THAT OUR ORPHAN WELLS SO. IF THAT WERE THE CASE WORST CASE SCENARIO WE'RE LOOKING AT ANYWHERE FROM FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO FIVE TO NINE BILLION DOLLARS- DEPENDING ON- THE YOU KNOW THE OUR ABILITY TO CLEAN UP AND SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU CAN COMMENT. ON HOW YOU KNOW WHAT'S NEXT YEAH SO ACROSS THE COMPANY ARE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY- GOVERNMENTS FACE THIS CHALLENGE OF POTENTIALLY LARGE VERY LARGE- FINANCIAL LIABILITY. OFF FOR- OF WELLS THAT HAVE ESSENTIALLY BEEN ORPHANED ON THAT WERE ONCE OWNED BY A PRIVATE OPERATOR BUT THAT GET LAPPED- HAVE PROBLEMS I THEN GOT NEED TO NOT. AND ACTUALLY STATES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE FACING THIS I WOULD- OBSERVE WE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE THIS CHALLENGE AS WELL. AND SO LJ I'M ACTUALLY BE SEVERAL YEARS AGO I REQUESTED THAT CCS T. WHICH IS THAT CALIFORNIA COUNCIL FOR SCIENCE TECHNOLOGY REALLY OBJECTIVE INDEPENDENT EXPERTS. STUDY THE POTENTIAL FINANCIAL LIABILITY THAT THE STATE HAS- THAT REPORT- THAT WAS JUST RELEASED DEMONSTRATES A SIGNIFICANT OUT OUT. THANKS LIABILITY FOR THIS. I'M OUR RESPONSE IS AT LEAST TWO FOLD- ONE IS TO IMPLEMENT AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN WHICH IS A BILL YOU AUTHORED THE GOVERNOR SIGNS THAT ACTUALLY INCREASES- BINDING REQUIREMENTS I'M COMPANIES. THAT ACTUALLY HAVE TO PUT UP MORE RESOURCES MORE FUNDING TO ENSURE THAT THERE CAN BE SAFE CLEAN UP OF THEIR ASSETS- BUT SECONDLY IT'S ACTUALLY TO BRING IN MORE CAPACITY AT CAL JAM. TO ACTUALLY QUANTIFY WHAT BONDING REQUIREMENT SHOULD BE- THERE'S SOME LEVEL OF SENSITIVITY ONTO A BINDING REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE WE HAVE VERY LARGE COMPANIES IN THIS INDUSTRY AND WE HAVE SMALLER COMPANIES AS YOU KNOW. AND SOME OF THE SMALL COMPANIES ARE CONCERNED WITH WHAT THEY WOULD CONSIDER TO BE EXCESSIVE BONDING REQUIREMENTS SO WE HAVE TO GET THIS RIGHT WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT COMPANIES ARE COVERING THEIR OWN FINAL INCH FINANCIAL LIABILITY BUT DO IT IN A FAIR WAY. SO IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET ACTUALLY RECALL. LEGISLATIVE APPROVAL. POSSESS TO ACTUALLY. ON APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE BONDING UP FOR PRIVATE COMPANIES. WELL IT'S A GREAT TO HEAR THAT IN AND WHILE TEN FIFTY SEVEN- WAS AN INCREASE IN MEAN IT FALLS REALLY SHORT OF THE OF THE POTENTIAL THAT WE SAW IN THE C. C. S. T. REPORT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT YOU KNOW MAXIMUM BONDING THIRTY MILLION VERSUS WHAT WERE POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT- AGAIN WORST CASE SCENARIO WE DON'T KNOW THE CONDITION OF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE ABANDONED WELLS- WHETHER THEY YOU KNOW TYPE OF REMAIN. CAN THEY WILL NEED BUT ANYTHING THAT TO TAXPAYERS FIVE TO NINE BILLION DOLLARS IN A WORST CASE AND- I'M IS FINITELY ALARMING IT MAKES THE THIRTY MILLION INCREASE JUST SEEM LIKE IT'S PENNIES- IN TERMS OF WHAT THE TAXPAYERS HAVE TO CLEAN UP I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THERE'S GONNA BE MORE. ON THE U. YOU SOME NEVER SURE TO. OUR CITY. THANK YOU. MR SACK ARE WELL. TO JOINT COMMITTEE HEARING ARM. I AT THE GOV. AND YOU'RE LEADERSHIP. AS EXPRESSED IN THE YEAR NOVEMBER AT ASSIGNMENTS ANNOUNCEMENT- ON- A SERIES OF MEASURES TO- MADE TO ENSURE THAT OUR OIL. AND GAS EXTRACTION PRACTICES ARE OUR A- A PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS AND- THIS YEAR YOUR YOUR TIMING IS PERFECT WHICH IS DEBATED A- A BILL MY BILL ON- THE ISSUE. OF WHETHER OR NOT STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I SHOULD HAVE- AND MINIMUM HEALTH AND SAFETY. BOB JONES BETWEEN OIL EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES AND- LAW CENTER POPULATIONS LIKE- SCHOOL'S PLAYGROUND. AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES ARM. BUT YOU KNOW I WELL WE I DON'T KNOW FOR A IF YOU. IT TALK MORE A DETAIL INTO OF WELL WHAT YOU IN THE GOVERNOR ARE- ARE CONSIDERING AT THIS POINT IN TERMS OF- VIA THE HEALTH AND SAFETY BUFFER ZONES- SO I'D LIKE TO START WITH THAT. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO AS I MENTIONED THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED IN AND WE ANNOUNCED IN NOVEMBER NOW THE INITIATION OF A RULE MAKING PROCESS- TO IMPROVE UP PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY MEASURES- OF OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION TO PROTECT- COMMUNITIES OF PEOPLE- WE ARE KICKING THAT PROCESS OFF. IN REALLY JUST A FEW WEEKS I BELIEVE WITH OUR FIRST. PUBLIC MEETING IN WHAT WE CALL THE PRE RULE MAKING PROCESS. AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A VERY ROBUST PRE RULE MAKING PROCESS BECAUSE IT LETS US GET OUT ACROSS THE STATE AND TALK TO A COMMUNITIES NEARBY OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION COMPANIES I ENGAGED IN THESE PRACTICES REALLY EVERY MANNER STAKEHOLDER TO GET INPUT- THEN THE CAL JAM STAFF. ACTUALLY TAKE THAT INPUT AND THEN DOES ITS OWN ANALYSIS AROUND- POTENTIAL MEASURES THE ADVOCACY OF THOSE MEASURES AND THE APPROPRIATENESS OF THOSE MEASURES- WE MADE CLEAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE CLEAR WE NEED TO ACCESS. EXPERTS IN I'M NOT ONLY THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY BUT IN PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TO UNDERSTAND WHAT MEASURES ARE MOST APPROPRIATE- WE HAVE NOT FORMED ANY CONCLUSIONS ON WHAT MEASURES ARE WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. TO INCLUDE IN THIS RULE MAKING ON THE ROOM PICKING NEED TO BE A TRANSPARENT SCIENCE BASED VERY CAREFUL PROCESS- TO UPDATE OUR REGULATIONS AND ULTIMATELY A NEED TO BE. A DURABLE OF TO. I'M SO WILL BE A CAREFUL CLASS AND WE WILL MOVE AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN. BUT IN A MANNER YOU ARE. OUT YEAH GEN. I MEASURES THAT ARE BOTH IMPORT APPROPRIATE AND ALL DEFENDABLE. AND IT HAS AS YOU ARE WELL OF. ALLOW OF THE OIL EXTRA ACTIVITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TAKE PLACE AND LOW INCOME COMMITTEES OF COLOR AND OTHER- SO CALLED AND FARMER JUSTICE COMMUNITIES- WHAT WHAT STEPS WILL YOU WILL YOU BE TAKEN TO ENSURE THAT- THERE IS ADEQUATE PARTICIPATION AND INPUT FROM- THESE- DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF- WELL EXTRACTION ACTIVITIES. THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION SO WE'VE WE'VE LISTENED TO LEADERS AND GROUPS REPRESENTING MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES WHO MADE VERY CLEAR THAT- THE PRE RULE MAKING PROCESS HAS TO BE CONDUCTED IN A WAY THAT'S ACCESSIBLE TO ALL CALIFORNIANS SO THAT'S LINGUISTICALLY ASSESSABLE FOR EXAMPLE FOR OUR SPANISH SPEAKING RESIDENTS. WE ALSO NEED TO BE ACCESSIBLE TO OUR FOLKS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO TRAVEL TO SACRAMENTO OR TO OUR BIG CITY SO ARE A SERIES OF WORKSHOPS WILL. HE'S IN CALIFORNIA- INCLUDING MANY THAT HAVE OIL PRODUCTION RIGHT THEY'RE BOTH SMALL AND LARGE AND OUR COMMITMENT IS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE AND ACCESSIBLE TRANSPARENT ARE PRE RULE MAKING PROCESS SO WE CAN. NOT REALLY BENEFIT FROM THE INPUT OF ALL CALIFORNIANS OKAY. AND LAST BUT CERTAINLY NOT LEAST YOU KNOW IN ISSUE THAT TO. YOU AND I HAVE HAVE HAVE TALKED ABOUT INFORMALLY IN AND I'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS WITH MY COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE. YOU KNOW IS THAT ISSUE OF THE JUST TRANSITION THAT YOU TALKED ABOUT- GIVE ME FOR MY EXPERIENCE. THE SO THIS NOT TO CRACK IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE FIGURE OUT A JUST TRANSITION SO THAT WE GET. YOU KNOW ESPECIALLY ARE A- ARE- UNION BROTHERS AND SISTERS TO. TO TRANSITION FROM- FROM THE FOSSIL FUEL JOBS TO- FUTURE CLEAN ENERGY JOBS- IS- IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST POLITICAL CHALLENGES. AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST OBSTACLES THAT I SEE IN TERMS OF. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- ACHIEVING OUR OR CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS ARE ARE THERE- YOU KNOW I KNOW YOU SAID THAT- IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A- THOUGHTFUL NIS AND A LOT OF TIME TO FIGURE THINGS OUT BUT THE ARE ARE THERE ARE THEIR OTHER. STATES THAT- THAT- CAN PROVIDED SOME GUIDANCE IN TERMS OF HOW- WE SHOULD BE PUT PROCEEDING. LICENSES THANK YOU I APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTION AND AS I MENTIONED BEFORE. YOU KNOW THIS TRANSITION AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS IN COMING DECADES REALLY TO ACHIEVE THE STATE LEGALLY MANDATED EMISSION REDUCTION TARGETS CLIMATE NEUTRALITY- REALLY NEED TO TAKE PLACE CAREFULLY. JUST LAST WEEK OR THE WEEK BEFORE SOME OF OUR AT LEADERSHIP FROM- THAT YOU'LL HEAR. LATER AT THIS HEARING WE'RE DOWN IN KERN COUNTY WHICH IS- AN AREA OF THE STATE THAT PRODUCES A LARGE PORTION OF OUR OIL- WHERE. THERE ARE QUITE A LOT OF MIDDLE CLASS JOBS OFFER KERN COUNTY RESIDENTS AND A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THAT COUNTY GENERAL FUND IS DERIVED FROM REVENUES OF OIL AND GAS. AND THEY MADE VERY CLEAR THAT THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT HOW ARE. NOT TRANSITION I IMPACTS THEIR OWN ECONOMY AND JOBS THAT ARE PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND SO OUR COMMITMENT IS TO PARTNER- WITH KERN COUNTY WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES AND REALLY TALK ABOUT- WATER POLICIES ARE. AND WHAT THEY'RE NOT- BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO A LOT OF CONCERN AND- AND ABOUT- SOME OF THESE ACTIONS THAT ARE REALLY NOT RELATED TO THAT TRANSITION- BUT REALLY WORKING WITH THEM- TO CONTINUE TO DIVERSIFY AND STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY OF. TIME I AM VERY EXCITED THAT IT SOUNDS LIKE LEADERS IN BAKERSFIELD FOR EXIT ALL HAVE A REALLY PROACTIVE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. I'M AFTER THERE WERE ON IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT- LEADERSHIP- BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE CONSIDER WHAT. ARE TRANSITION SHOULD BE ARE TOWARDS OTHER SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT WE HAVE A VERY CLEAR PATHWAY FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN THAT ARE. MAKING THEIR LIVING IN THAT INDUSTRY. THANK THANK YOU I HAVE JUST BEEN TO BY SENATORS JACKSON AND NAY CO CHAIR HENRY STERN HE SO I WILL IF IT OF THEM HAVE ANY AND I WILL START WITH THE SENATOR STERN. AT THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND THANKS FOR. PUTTING IN THE HARD WORK ESPECIALLY STAFF GETTING ALL THIS STARTED IN A FEW MONTHS IN THE MAKING HERE FRANKLY WHEN THE- WHEN THE- SIMMER SPILL HAPPENED. YOU KNOW WE WERE WE WERE REALLY INTENT ON BRING YOU GUYS IN RIGHT AWAY DIGGING IN- ESPECIALLY AMIDST ALL THE OTHER CHALLENGES DOG EARED BEEN FACING LAST YEAR WE SAW A CONFLICT OF INTEREST ISSUE ARISES. REPORTS ON DUMMY PERMITS IT WAS A TOUGH YEAR FOR DOGGER LAST YEAR WHICH IS WHY I WAS ACTUALLY. EXCITED THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON STEPPED UP AND HELPED- WITH US AND YOU. I CLOSE THAT CHAPTER AND IT WAS THE END OF DOG SO I'M I'M EXCITED ABOUT TODAY AND I REALLY JUST. ONE YOU TO THANK THE GOVERNOR ON OUR BEHALF FOR NOT HAVING TO GO THROUGH- GOTCHA PROCESS AND- DO THEY DO THIS SORT OF SONG AND DANCE PART OF AN OVERSIGHT HEARING BUT YOU ALL STEPPED IN IMMEDIATELY. TOOK ON THE CONFLICT INTERESTED ISSUE HEAD ON I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK THROUGH THE RESPONSE IN THE SORDID HOURS AFTER SAM RICK AND- RAPID RESPONSE THERE FROM. WHAT IS NOW CAL JAM AND D. O. C. BUT SINCE WE HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF YOU HERE MISTER SECRETARY- I KNOW YOU'RE STARTED TALK ABOUT SOME AS HIGH LEVEL ISSUES AROUND. FOSSIL FUEL DEPENDENCE AND SOME OF THE TENSIONS IN THE STATE. WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WORKING ON FRACKING FEW YEARS BACK. TODAY WE REALIZE THAT. IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT FRACKING. AND THAT THERE ARE COMPLEXITIES WITH STEAM. ESPECIALLY HIGH PRESSURE STATE THAT GOES ABOVE THE FRACTURE GRADING LIKE WE'VE SEEN OUT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- THAT LED TO. THIS MXC AND SO- THE UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROL PROGRAM IS SOME VERY INTERESTED IN I JUST WANTED TO TRY TO GET YOUR- YOUR THOUGHTS I KNOW. THE AGENCY OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS HAS STARTED TO RECOGNIZE THERE'S A THERE'S A CHALLENGED THERE'S A LOT WE DON'T KNOW- THE REPORT YOU ALL RELEASED AND I WAS THRILLED TO SEE I THINK THREE REPORTS ACTUALLY CAME THROUGH IN THE LAST WEEK FROM RESOURCES DO SEE. CAL JIM BUT- ONE OF THEM TROUBLED ME. OUR WHEN IT COMES TO SORT OF THE PROJECT BY PROJECT REVIEW OF ALL THE ACTIVE YOU I SEE GOING ON AROUND THE STATE AND FOR ME MEMBERS UNDERGRAD INJECTION CONTROL IS- IS A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH AT IT'S NOT LIMITED JUST TO FRACKING IT'S A DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATION OF WELLS BUT ESSENTIALLY. ARE YOU I SEE PERMIT AS TO BE OBTAINED FOR A LOT OF THESE LARGE STEAM ORIENTED OPERATIONS- AND WE HAVE ABOUT. CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG NOW. BUT I THINK WE HAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED NINETY SIX ACTIVE YOU I SEE PROJECTS THAT HAVE. BEEN SUBJECT TO- SIR WHAT WOULD YOU GUYS ARE ON A PROJECT BY PROJECT REVIEW AMONG THE THOUSAND OR SO IN THE STATE. AND FROM WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE SEEN I THINK. LESS THAN TEN LET'S JUST SAY I'VE HEARD THE NUMBER NINE I'VE HEARD LESS HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN COMPLETED. THAT MEANS WE'VE WE'VE GOT ABOUT. NINE HUNDRED. SOME ODD MORE TO GO TO REALLY GET OURSELVES AHEAD OF ANY POTENTIAL PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE SO THAT WE DON'T GET CAUGHT OFF GUARD HERE. AND FRANKLY TO HELP THE INDUSTRY TO BE GOOD STEWARDS IN GOOD PARTNERS RIGHT IF WE HAVE BLIND SPOTS OUT THERE AND THEIR OTHER GEOLOGIC CHALLENGES WE GOT TO GET AHEAD OF THAT STUFF- SO I JUST WANTED TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU. TIMELINE COMPLETION SCHEDULE JUST HOW HOW TO GO ABOUT THAT BROADER YOU I SEE PROGRAM IF YOU. AND WHO YEAH WELL WHAT WE CAN EXPECT I GUESS IN THE COMING YEAR I KNOW THERE'S A BUDGET REQUEST AND SOME IS WILL BE ABOUT CAPACITY BUILDING TO WITHIN THE AGENCY BUT- ANY. PROJECTIONS ON ON SIR TIMELINE A MILESTONE FOR THAT BROADER. WAY OLD EXTRACTION PERMIT LANDSCAPE THIS YEAR YEP SO SUPERVISOR AND TOOK WOULD. HAVE MAYBE MORE DETAILED INFORMATION THAN I WOULD BUT LET ME TAKE A CRACK- WHICH IS- WE'VE MADE PROGRESS IMPROVING OUR REGULATIONS ON UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROL INCLUDING A SET OF STRENGTH AND REGULATIONS THAT. THAT WENT INTO EFFECT LAST APRIL. BUT THE DIVISION RECOGNIZES THAT MORE WORK IS NEEDED. AND INITIATED ARE ASKED FOR AND ANOTHER INDEPENDENT REPORT THAT YOU'LL SOON BE RECEIVING FROM THE GROUNDWATER PROTECTION COUNCIL. WHICH IS THE NATIONAL BODY OF EXPERTS- FOCUSED AT IN AND OUT REPORT OF FOCUSES ITS REVIEW ON CALIFORNIA'S UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROL PROGRAM. AND WILL IDENTIFY I. A SERIES COMMENDATIONS TO STRENGTHEN THAT PROGRAM. THAT REPORT. WELL IN. A VERY BROAD TASK FORCE THAT WAS ESTABLISHED THROUGH STATUTE- TO FURTHER RECOMMEND CHANGES TO THE UNDERGROUND INJECTION CONTROL PROGRAM- THAT- TASK FORCE HAS BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY FOR THIS REPORT. AND WHEN IT RECEIVES IT VERY SOON- WILL BENEFIT FROM THE RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THIS DOT NATIONAL BODY THAT'S TAKEN A VERY FOCUSED INTENSE REVIEW OF THE U. I. C. PROGRAM- AND THEN AS I UNDERSTAND THAT- STATUTORILY REQUIRED. TASK FORCE AGAIN COMPRISED OF A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF STAKEHOLDERS WILL ITSELF THEN I RECOMMEND ARE FURTHER STRENGTHENING OF THE OF YOU I SEE REGULATIONS- SO IS THAT SOMETHING. WE GET DONE THIS YEAR. WELL IT'S SOMETHING WE SHOULD MAKE AND I DON'T WANNA MAJOR QUESTION SOMETHING WE SHOULD MAKE PROGRESS ON THIS YEAR WHAT I'M LEARNING. ABOUT OUR RULE MAKING PROCESS IS IT'S VERY CAREFUL AND DELIBERATE HAVE AND SO IN TERMS OF GETTING. UPDATED REGULATIONS FINISH THIS YEAR I THINK THAT'S UNREALISTIC- BUT YOU CAN CERTAINLY ASK OTHERS WHO WHO FOLLOW ME OUT FOR SORT OF MORE DETAILS STEP FORWARD A GOOD WILL DIG IN AND I'M JUST HOPING WE CAN HAVE SOME PRIORITIZATION. IS THERE'S SO MANY WELLS OUT THERE AND WE'RE JUST I MET THE ACTIVE YOU I SEE WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT ABANDONED WELLS AND- YOU KNOW. THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF LIABILITY WE'RE LOOKING AT THERE'S A BIT OF A NEW FRAMEWORK IN PLACE- THANKS TO SOME COLLEAGUES WORK HERE BUT- LET'S TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT A PRODUCTIVE PRIORITIZATION LOOKS LIKE SO THAT. ESPECIALLY THOSE PROJECTS HAVE A REAL PEOPLE IT FACE. RIGHT THAT ARE CLOSEST TO. THAT ARE FRONT LINES- THAT THEY HAVE SOME CERTAINTY ABOUT- WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT- YOU KNOW THIS IS URBAN LOS ANGELES DOWN IN THE LONG BEACH NORTHERN CALIFORNIA RIGHT I BACKYARDS ALL OVER CALIFORNIA WE ARE AN ALL STATE. WE STILL ARE DESPITE ALL OUR- ENERGY GOAL THEN CLUB. RATIONS I THINK IT'S TIME WE GET HONEST ABOUT THIS I GUESS THAT WAS MY OTHER QUESTION IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'VE ALREADY. TOUCHED ON IT SOMEWHAT BUT- YEAH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE TIME LINE OR PLANNING IS AROUND FINISHING THIS CARBON NEUTRALITY STUDY AND HOW TO REALLY WRESTLE WITH THOSE BIG PICTURE ISSUES THEY HAVE A SENSE FOR US OF I KNOW YOU'VE BEEN DOING YOUR- YOUR LISTEN NOW LISTENING TO OUR MEDICAL SCOPING PROCESS. HE WAS KERN COUNTY HEARING THE OTHER DAY. ZOOMING IS PROBABLY FEW MORE SCHEDULE BUT GIVE SAYS SORT OF SENSE OF. HOW YOU GUYS WANT TO. ONE WHAT TIME WHEN YOU WERE WRESTLE WITH THE STUDY ITSELF AND THEN. REALLY WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT YOU YOU OVERSEE NOT JUST OIL AND GAS BUT ALL THE NATURAL AND WORKING LATE IN THE STATE AND- AS FRUSTRATING AS SOME OF THE SETBACKS MAYBE I ALSO THINK THERE'S- SOME HUGE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE THIS STATE A NET- ANNETTE. SEQUESTER CARBON TO ACTUALLY TAKE SOME OF THIS POLLUTION AND REMOVE IT THROUGH BETTER AG MANAGEMENT PRACTICES TO BET FORCE MANAGEMENT- SMARTER USE A BIO MASS OF THINGS THAT- DON'T ACTUALLY DIRECTLY INVOLVE THE OIL INDUSTRY BUT- HOW DOES THAT HELP YOU HELP US PEACE ALL THAT TOGETHER SIR WHAT WHAT DO YOU. WHAT DO YOU GUYS LOOKING AT HERE AND YOUR HEAD. SO WE ARE LOOKING AT COMPLETING- I BELIEVE BOTH OF THE STUDIES THAT I MENTIONED I THINK BEFORE YOU CAME IN ESSENTIALLY TANDEM STUDIES. ARE MANAGED BY OUR SISTER AGENCY CAL CALIFORNIAN BY MY PROTECTION AGENCY. ONE BEING FOCUSED ON. WHAT WHAT IS THE PATHWAY TO CLIMATE NEUTRALITY AS IT RELATES TO FOSSIL FUEL DEMAND AND SUPPLY. NOW WITH A SPECIFIC FOCUS ON AS WE REDUCE OUR BY THE DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS HOW SHOULD THAT INFORM OUR POLICY ON OIL AND GAS SUPPLY IN THE STATE. THAT'S A COMPLEX SORT OF ALMOST ON PRESIDENT A QUESTION. I AND SO OUR APPROACH HAS BEEN TO REALLY BRING IN THE BEST AND BRIGHTEST MINDS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE UC SYSTEM. TO COMPLETE AN INDEPENDENT REPORT OR STUDY TO REALLY EVALUATE PATHWAYS TO ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS. ARE THE TEN THIS THE COMPANION STUDY IS MORE FOCUSED ON WHAT WE NEED TO BE DOING TO INTENSIFY I- LECTURE FOR CATION OF TRANSPORTATION A REDUCTION OF POLLUTION FROM TRANSPORTATION. I AND AGAIN I BELIEVE WE ANTICIPATE DROPS OF BOTH OF THOSE REPORTS TO THIS YEAR. OKAY RIGHT ARM AND LASTLY ALL DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES AFTER THIS- DO YOU HAVE A SENSE WHETHER- THEY'RE GONNA BE ANY. I KNOW THERE'S A MORATORIUM AND IS CURRENTLY ON- ON NEW- PROJECTS- SORT OF ABOVE A CERTAIN FRACTURE GRADIENT ABOVE A CERTAIN PRESSURE GRADIENT- FOR YOU I SEE PROJECTS AROUND THE STATE BUT- THE BROADER ISSUE UNDERLYING IT LITERALLY PHYSICALLY IS THE AQUA FIRST- AND WE HAVE A LOT OF EXEMPT AQUIFER'S IN THE STATE- THAT OUR- IS THE- BEYOND REPAIR. BUT WE HAVE SOME THAT ARE NOT AND TRY TO SQUARE THOSE TWO CATEGORIES AND ARE THOSE REALLY LIST ON THE EXAM DOCTOR FOR LIST SHOULD ACTUALLY BE THERE- ANY THOUGHTS AND JUST SORT OF. GROUNDWATER IMPACT AND WHETHER YOU WILL ANTICIPATE EXPANDING- AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS DO YOU ANTICIPATE ACTUALLY- MAKING IT A NEW REQUEST FOR AQUIFER EXEMPTION EXPANSIONS- HOW HOW ARE YOU FEELING THAT. SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR STATE WATER BOARD IN A REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARDS WHO ARE REALLY ARE KEY PARTNER- ON THIS QUESTION OF ENSURING THAT ANY OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DOESN'T HAVE IMPACTS ON AQUIFERS THAT COULD BE EVEN REMOTELY USED- FOR. HUMAN USE. THAT PARTNERSHIP EXTENDS ALSO TO THE US ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY SO THERE'S QUITE A CAREFUL GROUP OF TECHNICAL EXPERTS THAT ARE ADVISING I THE DIVISION- CAL JAM- ON THIS QUESTION AROUND WHICH AQUIFER'S ARE PROPRIA OIL AND GAS- WE AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE BROUGHT UP BROUGHT ON SUPERVISOR AND TALK- AS OUR NEW OIL AND GAS SUPERVISOR IS HIS. HIS TECHNICAL BACKGROUND IN PETROLEUM ENGINEERING AND HE IS FOCUSING ON THE ON THIS QUESTION WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT OUR OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DOESN'T HAVE IMPACTS ON ON DRINKING WATER AQUIFERS- THERE IS A STRONG REGULATORY FRAMEWORK IN PLACE FOR DOING THAT AND WE JUST NEED TO ENSURE THAT THAT'S IMPLEMENTED TO THE FULLEST EXTENT OF THE LAW. BUT DESPITE THE POINT NO PLAN ON EXPANDING EXEMPTIONS. NO WELL OCT. YEAH I MEAN I THINK IT'S BEST DIRECTED FOR THE SUPERVISOR IN PART BECAUSE THIS THIS REQUEST FOR AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS IS SORT OF WHEN IT ONE OF THE MANY PERMITTING REQUEST THAT WE GET IN THE STATE. FINISHED AND SO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER WE ARE APPROVING NEW AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS THAT I WANT TO SUGGEST THAT THE EXPANDING BUT I THINK HE'S BEST ANSWER. SOUTHERN SOUNDS LIKE SENATE JACKSON GORGEOUS CENTER BOARD IS FOR MY CHANG KEEPING. YOU OFFER ME I CAME IN A LITTLE BIT LATE- THE SENATE WHEN LONGER THAN EXPECTED. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE CONTENTS PLEASURE. I KIND OF WANTED TO. CHATTEL ABOUT. THE LAW FUND ABILITY BECAUSE YOU TALKED ABOUT- THERE'S A UC STUDY THAT'S FORTHCOMING AND THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPLY CALCULATION- WHICH WE ARE COMMON A MOMENT AGO THAT IN MANY RESPECTS WE STILL AREN'T OIL STATE OR AT LEAST INDUSTRIES- ARE RELIANT ON THAT TRADITIONAL FORM OF ENERGY- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS OR RECOMMENDATIONS. ON WHEN WE DO PURSUE AS A STATE A MORE PROGRESSIVE AGENDA- ENVIRONMENTALLY FRIENDLY AGENDA SO ON SO FORTH. THAT WE'VE THAT WE SIMULTANEOUSLY CONTEMPLATE. THROUGH THE STUDY OR THROUGH- INPUTS INTO LEGISLATION ARM AWAIT UNDERSTAND. HOW EXACTLY ARE SUPPLY CALCULATION HE IS GOING TO BE IMPACTED BY A GIVEN PIECE OF LEGISLATION OR A- SHUTTING OFF THE SPIGOT SO ON AND SO FORTH BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS THAT AS WE PURSUE AS WE PURSUE A CLEANER FORM- OF ENERGY AND ALL THAT ALL THE INSTRUMENTS THAT GO INTO THAT. THAT WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO RELY MORE HEAVILY ENGLISH CALIFORNIA ON FOREIGN IMPORTS SO IT'S KIND OF LIKE WERE BLOWING THE LEAVES OFF OUR LAWN TO OUR OUR NEIGHBORS BUT- IN TERMS OF PUBLIC POLICY WE'RE IMPORTING FROM DRACONIAN REGIMES ELSEWHERE IN THE CUT IN THE WORLD. THEY DO NOT LIKE US NOR DO THEY HOLD OUR VALUES TO HEART. SO I GUESS DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS A RECOMMENDATION THAT HOW DO WE BALANCE. THIS DISCUSSION IN SUCH A WAY THAT WE APPRECIATE THE LAW OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND WE CAN DEAL WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF THOSE EVENTS BUT WERE MINDFUL OF THEM BECAUSE MY CONCERN IS THAT WE'RE NOT ALWAYS APPRECIATIVE. OF YOUR WEATHER BEAT THE WORK FORCE- OR THE IDEA THAT WE'RE IMPORTING OIL AND OTHER FORMS OF ENERGY FROM REALLY ROUGH PARTS OF THE WORLD THAT. ARE WORKING AGAINST US IN MANY RESPECTS. THANKS FOR THE QUESTION I WOULD SAY. WE RECOGNIZE THAT FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED TO FOCUS ON EXPANDING CONSUMER CHOICES TO REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOSSIL FUELS SO FOR EXAMPLE. ARE ELECTRIFICATION OF PASSENGER VEHICLES YOUR ELECTRIC CARS SOLAR ON ROOFS ESSENTIALLY FINDING WAYS TO REDUCE OUR OUR DEMAND FOR FOSSIL FUELS WHEREVER THEY COME FROM- ULTIMATELY A WEEK WE NEED TO DO THAT IF WE'RE GOING TO MEET THIS LEGALLY MANDATED TARGET TO REDUCE OUR EMISSIONS EIGHTY PERCENT. THAT BEING SAD IT'S A COMPLICATED QUESTION ABOUT WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE SUPPLY IN CALIFORNIA- RECOGNIZING THAT A WHOLE LOT OF PEOPLE DEPEND ON JOBS IN THE INDUSTRY PARTS OF THE STATE ARE ARE RELYING ON THAT AND THERE IS THIS QUESTION AROUND SIMPLY REPLACING IN STATE PRODUCTION WITH FOREIGN PRODUCTION- IF AT IT IN SOME CONTEST IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES. SO RECOGNIZING THIS IS COMPLICATED TERRIBLY COMPLICATED AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED TO ASK REALLY THIS QUESTION ABOUT WHAT HOW ARE SUPPLY POLICY SHOULD BE IMPACTED BY OUR BROAD CLIMB MICHAEL'S WE'RE REALLY LOOKING TO DO THIS YOU SEE STUDY NOT TO GIVE US THE ANSWERS BUT TO FRAME PATHWAYS THAT WE CAN FURTHER. DIALOGUE ABOUT I'M RECOGNIZING WE KNOW THIS THE TRANSITION IN TERMS OF REDUCING FOSSIL FUEL THAT WE NEED TO MAKE BUT IT HAS TO TAKE PLACE CAREFULLY TO AVOID. CONSEQUENCES WHEN THOSE REPORTS ARE PUBLIC. THE OBVIOUS BE A REALLY GOOD- PRODUCT TO INFORM YOUR THANK YOU CONSIDER A JUST AND ARE ARE INTERACTION I AS IT RELATES OIL AND GAS. AN OVERSIGHT WELL THANK YOU I THINKTHAT IS IMPORTANT AND LOOKING AROUND HERE AND I AM JUST DID A GLASS NIGHT DO TUNING. GEN THERE'S A GREAT I MAKES YOU TO SEE CALIFORNIA IT'S GOING DOWN. ALASKA'S DOWN. SAUDI ARABIA. HAS BEEN IN THE UPPER TRIP STRUCTURING YEAH SO THAT THE LAW FUND YOUR WITH WEEK CREATE A- AND BY HERE WE ARE STILL. PART OF A LARGER FAMILY AND BUNCH ABILITY PLAYS INTO. INTO THAT I THINK THAT'S A FAIR POINT AND WE NEED TO RECOGNIZE- THAT WHETHER YOU KNOW WE'RE GENERATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM GAS IMPORTED FROM SAUDI ARABIA FROM CALIFORNIA WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE CREATING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS SO YOUR POINT IS YOUR POINT IS A GOOD ONE. THANK YOU A SENATOR JACKSON'S. ALL I'D LIKE TO FOLLOW UP IN AFTER FIRST I WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS WHOLE ISSUE OF. THE FACT THAT WE ARE- GRANTING THESE AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS. SO WE HAVE STATE AGENCIES THAT THAT ARE CONSULTED YOU MENTION A FEW OF THEM AND THAT ARE TO REVIEW BEFORE RECOMMENDING THE SHOCK OF FOR EXEMPTIONS TO THE FENCE WELL THAT SHOULD RESULT IN GOOD DECISION MAKING BECAUSE WE ARE CLOSER TO THE ISSUE AND CAN NO MORE PRECISELY WHAT OUR STATE AGENCIES AND REGIONAL AFFAIRS OFFICES ARE DOING. BUT RECENTLY AND IN MY DISTRICT ALONE IN BOTH PARTS OF MY DISTRICT WE HAVE TWO AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS THAT ARE PROPOSED BY CAL JAM THAT HAVE BEEN VERY CONTENTIOUS AND I'M SITTING NEXT TO MY COLLEAGUE THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMON IN WHOSE DISTRICT THOSE TWO VERY CONTENTIOUS AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS ALSO EXIST OR AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. IT WILL BE THE OTHER AT SOME POINT- AND THEY'RE VERY CONCERNED THE COMMUNITIES WHICH IRONICALLY ARE NOT NECESSARILY WHAT YOU'D CALL ENVIRONMENTALLY THREE HAVE GROUPS THERE. AREAS THE RANCHERS. AND THERE IS EVEN MINERAL EXPLOITATION AND SOME OF THEM BUT THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE POPULATIONS AND THE LOCAL PEOPLE WHO ARE SUBJECT TO THE- TO THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THESE EXEMPTIONS. ARE ARE. ACTIVELY TRYING TO GET BETTER DATA BECAUSE THERE IS A STRONG BELIEF BASED UPON EVIDENCE THAT HAS ARISEN THAT THESE ARE AQUIFER'S OUT WITH OIL WASTE WATER ARE- AN IMPACT IN A POTENTIAL DANGER TO THE TO THE- WATER QUALITY AND THEIR DRINKING WATER SUPPLY BUT SO ONE OF THEM IS IN CAT CANYON FOR EXAMPLE. OF THE COMMUNITY THERE IS THAT'S COME TO US AS HAS- HAS INDICATED THEY DON'T WANT THE EXPANSION. OF BECAUSE THEY ARE CONCERNED- THAT IT WILL IMPACT BOTH THEIR WATER QUALITY IN THEIR LOCAL AIR QUALITY TWO HUNDRED NEW WELLS BEING DRILLED THERE- AN ACTION DEBATE. AND YET AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S AN ONGOING STUDY STILL PENDING THERE- BY THE US GEOLOGICAL SURVEY I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S THE SAME ONE THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING EARLIER BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO GET TO THE QUESTION WHETHER- WASTE WATER THAT'S CONVENIENT FOR THE OIL COMPANIES TO STASH UNDERGROUND IS GOING TO BECOME A DRINKING WATER SUPPLY- THAT ARE ALREADY FACING SIGNIFICANT WATER POLLUTION TO WATER QUALITY. ISSUES THIS IS NOT UNCOMMON THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE STATE I'VE JUST PARTICULARLY AWARE OF THIS PROBLEM BECAUSE IT'S IN MY DEATH DISTRICT AND THINGS LIKE HEXAVALENT CHROMIUM. I MEAN WE KNOW THESE ARE- CONTAMINANTS WE KNOW THEY ARE CARCINOGENIC AND YET- THIS KIND TO ALL OF. OUR ENTHUSIASM GRANT EXEMPTIONS A SEEMS TO STILL EXIST WHETHER WE CALL A DOCTOR OR CAL JAMMER WHATEVER WE CALL IT SO I'M PARTICULARLY CONCERNED WITH- WHAT. ARE YOUR POLICY IS GOING TO BE- ESPECIALLY WITH THESE APPROVAL STILL HAPPENING WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO HOLD THE LINE ON THIS UNTIL AT LEAST THIS. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY IS COMPLETED IT SEEMS TO ME THERE IS A- A MOVE TO GRANT EXEMPTIONS. UP OF RATHER THAN TO BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CIRCUMSPECT ABOUT THEM AND I GET CONCERNED WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WELL THE NEED FOR JOBS I MEAN EITHER WE'RE GOING TO MEET OUR GOALS. IN OUR GHG GOALS AND IN OUR- OUR QUALITY THAT YOU KNOW OUR OUR ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY- GOALS OR WE'RE NOT. AND I CHEST THIS THIS NOTION THAT WE HAVE TO WAIT THE TWO HAS HISTORICALLY I THINK BEEN OF THE THUMB HAS BEEN OF FOR THE JOBS. ISSUE RATHER THAN THE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUES NOW I'M NOT SAYING WE GO COLD TURKEY BUT WE'VE RENAMED DAGR CAL JAM WITH THE WITH THE MISSION THAT IT BE MORE CONCERNED ABOUT THE HEALTH ASPECTS OF OIL AND GAS DRILLING AND YET I'M NOT SENSING AND I HAVEN'T HEARD YOU SAY. YET TODAY THAT THAT IS INDEED. THE COMMITMENT IN THE MISSION OF YOUR YOUR WORK. YEAH WELL THANK YOU SENATOR AND HAVE YOU MISSED THE OPENING WHEN I WAS IDENTIFYING REALLY THE TWO PRINCIPLES THAT ARE DRIVING OUR OIL AND GAS OVER STATE- ONE OF WHICH IS A STRENGTH IN REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WITH AN EMPHASIS ON PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT. SO WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER EARLY MON TEN FIFTY SEVEN- AB TEN FIFTY SEVEN- YOU KNOW WE HAVE TAKEN TO HEART AND WE'RE GLAD TO- PARTNER ON THE UPDATE OF. OF CAL GEMS MISSION- I'M NOT SURE IF YOU ALSO HEARD ME EXPLAIN THAT FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THE DIVISION'S HISTORY WE ARE. A FOCUSING A SPECIFIC RULE MAKING ON IMPROVING HEALTH AND SAFETY STANDARDS- TO WITH THAT WITH A FOCUS ON- COMMUNITIES ADJACENT OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION SO. I'M WILL ULTIMATELY NEED TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT WE'RE WHAT WE'RE DOING- TO EMBODY THE MISSION BUT I CAN TELL YOU THE WORK IS UNDER WAY- ON THE ISSUE OF CLEAN AND SAFE DRINKING WATER THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR OBVIOUSLY- LAST YEAR- TO TACKLE THIS PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE WERE COMMUNITIES. I DON'T HAVE ACCESS DICK SAFE DRINKING WATER SO INSURE THAT THAT COMMUNITIES DO HAVE THAT CLEAN SAFE WATER IS. A HUGE PRIORITY I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE NEED TO I CAL JAM ENSURE THAT WE HAVE THE BEST SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION. TO MAKE THOSE TO SIT AROUND WHICH AQUIFER'S ARE SAFE TO INJECT. YOU KNOW TREATED. BOB WATER I LOOK IN THE TO INSTANCES I BELIEVE IN SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THAT YOU REFERENCE- ONES ALSO A FILM MORE. OKAY INVENTOR ACCOUNT OKAY GOT IT- SO WHAT WILL WILL FOLLOW UP I AND TAKE MORE INTO THOSE- DIRECTLY BUT I CAN TELL YOU THERE'S NO ENTHUSIASM NECESSARILY- TO- ISSUE PERMITS ARE ARE OUR APPROACH IS- FULLY IMPLEMENTING THE- LAWS IN THE RULES ON THE BOOKS. IN A FAIR AND THROW AWAY AND CONTINUING TO STRENGTH AND- OUR REGULATIONS. WELL I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT WORKING ON IT THOUGH MAKES ME A LITTLE NERVOUS THE PEOPLE WHO COMMITTED FIFTY YEARS AGO TO COMPLY WITH TITLE NINE ARE STILL WORKING ON IT FIFTY YEARS LATER. I HOPE THAT ISN'T THE ISSUE HAVE TO DO WITH YOUR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT BEING HERE WE WERE. STILL ON THE FLOOR UNDERSTOOD BUT- YOU KNOW TO ME THE PROOF OF THE PUDDING IS ALWAYS IN IN THE IN THE EATING AND I'LL BE VERY INTERESTED TO SEE WHAT. ANNOUNCEMENTS AND PRONOUNCEMENTS YOU MAKE ON ON THIS ISSUE AND PARTICULARLY. ARE WE GONNA BUT WE CAN TRY TO MEET THOSE- GHG REDUCTION GOALS WE GONNA TRY TO BECOME. MORE ENERGY INDEPENDENT. YOU KNOW I CAN'T. SAUDI ARABIA OF PROBABLY THE REASONS IT'S PRODUCTION IS GONE UP OUR MULTI PURPOSE MULTI FOLD. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE CAN ONLY DO WHAT WE CAN DO BUT IF WE ARE REALLY GOING TO MEET AND BE SERIOUS ABOUT THOSE GOALS WE'VE GOT TO SEE. SOME TIME TABLES AND SOME. ACTUAL RESULTS INTO A LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THOSE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER FLORA THANK YOU SECRETARY CROWFOOT APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND TAKE YOUR TIME I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE TODAY SO I'M JUST GONNA KEEP MY REMARKS VERY VERY SHORT BUT IN A FEW CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD REALLY ACTUALLY OVER YOUR POLICY OVER THE LAST YOU KNOW FEW MONTHS I WHEN I START HERE IN TRANSITION WHEN I WHEN THAT WHEN I HEAR THAT WORD TRANSITION FROM FOSSIL FUELS INTO A GREENER ECONOMY COMING FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY WAS OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE. WHAT I ACTUALLY HERE IS COST OF LIVING ISSUES AND SO WHEN I HEAR YOU SAY MINDFUL AND TAKE TIME LIKE I THINK THOSE ARE VERY IMPORTANT THINGS THAT SOME OF OUR COLLEAGUES DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THAT WHEN WE AS AN AGRICULTURE COMMUNITY WHEN WE WERE GROWING THE CROPS AND THE FOOD THAT OUR STATE AND QUITE FRANKLY THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD CONSUME. WHEN WE GO OFF OF THE CHEAPEST FORM OF YOU KNOW FUEL INTO ANOTHER FORM OF TECHNOLOGY. IF THAT. HAS BECOME. A FINE FEASIBLE AND WE'RE NOT THERE YET. IT DOES ONE THING TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT DRIVES UP OUR COST OF LIVING. AS I THINK AS E HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I MIGHT COURAGE MEANT IS THAT WE KEEP THIS IN MIND. BECAUSE I'M NOT SURE AND THIS IS MORE OF A STATEMENT I WOULD LOVE YOUR I MEAN THIS PART IS THE QUESTION. DOES THE ADMINISTRATION- HAVE AN APPETITE. FOR IT AND ALL THE ABOVE TYPE OF APPROACH. UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE GOALS OUT THERE THAT WE WANT TO MEET. BUT DECIMATING THE FOSSIL FUEL COMMUNITY MAY NOT IN ITS ENTIRETY MAY NOT BE A GREAT OPTION EITHER. SO DOES THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE AN APPETITE FOR AND ALL OF THE ABOVE TYPE OF APPROACH. WELL FROM MY PERSPECTIVE. YOU KNOW STATE LAW IS CLEAR THAT WE NEED. TO REDUCE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. EIGHTY PERCENT- BY MID CENTURY. AND I THINK. THE GOVERNOR'S ALSO EMBRACED- THIS TARGET OF CLIMATE NEUTRALITY IN THAT TIME. BOB AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT TRANSITION WE RECOGNIZE THAT- NON POSSIBLE- FUEL FORMS OF ENERGY ARE BECOMING CHEAPER THERE ARE EXPANDING CHOICES AND THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR OUR CLIMATE GOALS. AT THE SAME TIME WHAT I WANT TO BE CLEAR ON IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE THAT TRANSITION. IF APPROACHED IN A IN A NON THOUGHTFUL WAY COULD HAVE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND PART OF OUR GOALS ARE OF COURSE YEAH AS IT RELATES TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS TO ENSURE THE CONTINUED ECONOMIC BY A TAB VITALITY OF COMMUNITIES. SO WE NEED TO DO BOTH. WE NEED TO TRANSIT TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON AND ULTIMATELY YOU KNOW CARBON ECONOMY BUT IN A MANNER ARE PARTS OF OUR STATE BEHIND. AND THAT'S COMPLICATED AND WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS NOW BUT I THINK IT'S AN EVOLVING DIALOGUE- WILL HAVE. HERE IN THE COMING FEW YEARS AROUND WHAT WHAT- WHAT POLICIES ARE NEEDED TO ACTUALLY FOLLOW THROUGH ON AT TOWARD THESE TARGETS BUT IN WAYS THAT MINIMIZE ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN IMPACTS ACROSS THE STATE. NOT I APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER AND I WOULD JUST YOU KNOW AS AS COMING FROM THE INDUSTRY YOU KNOW WHATEVER THE INDUSTRY IN THE JUSTICE CONTINUE ENGAGEMENT OF INDUSTRY TO HELP THE GOVERNOR ME HIS GOALS I THINK IS JUST KIND OF OUR OUR PLEA AND ALL OF THIS. IS LIKE WE HAVE THIS COLLABORATION THIS THIS THIS WORKING TOGETHER THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY BENEFIT YOU KNOW. YOUR TIDES RISE ALL SHIPS. AND I THINK THIS IS ONE OF THOSE EXAMPLES THAT I THINK THERE IS A PATHWAY FORWARD IF WE'RE WILLING TO IT TO IDENTIFIES APPRECIATE YOUR TIME SECRETARY IN. I THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE. YEAH THANK YOU AND I'LL JUST LASTLY SAY YOU KNOW WE WERE REALLY FOCUSED ON MAINTAINING A DIALOGUE WITH ALL MANNER STAKEHOLDERS SO YOU'LL HEAR FROM A REPRESENTATIVE OF- ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITY BASED. ORGANIZATION AND A REPRESENTATIVE OF THE INDUSTRY I THINK IF YOU ASK BOTH OF THEM- THEY'LL TELL YOU THAT THEY HAVE AN OPEN DIALOGUE CERTAINLY WITH OUR AGENCY AND THE DIVISION. BECAUSE THESE ARE COMPLICATED TOPICS WITH SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ACROSS THE BOARD. AND MULTIPLE DIMENSIONS WE JUST HAVE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS INPUT INTO OUR DECISION MAKING. THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. SECRETARY I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THE TIME TODAY YEAH THANK YOU VERY MUCH APPRECIATED I'M GONNA CALL UP OUR NEXT PANEL. WE'RE GONNA LOOK MORE SPECIFICALLY THE SUMMER OILFIELD SERVICE EXPRESSIONS ON THE OIL SPILL- I WILL ALLOW THE PANELISTS TO COME UP AND GIVE A VERY BRIEF. INTRODUCTIONS YOURSELF AND JUST FOR THE BENEFIT OF TIME. IF YOU CAN TRY TO BE AS- A- JUDICIAL WITH YOUR COMMENTS AS POSSIBLE- THAT WOULD BE TERRIFIC WE DO ANOTHER PANEL AFTER YOU AND THEN PUBLIC COMMENTS. SO WE'RE GOING TO HAVE- DAVID ISSUE BOSNIAN DIRECTOR DOESN'T NEED FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSERVATION. SUPERVISOR AND TALK FROM THE STATE OIL AND GAS- SUPERVISOR FOR THE PERMIT OF CONSERVATION. THOMAS COLIN FROM THE OFFICE OF CIVIL PREVENTION AND RESOURCES. AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO FINISH WITH WILLIAM A LACK OF THE VICE PRESIDENT OF CHEVRON. SO I WILL ACTUALLY ALLOW THE THREE- AGENCY OFFICIALS TO DECIDE WHAT ORDER YOU'D LIKE TO SPEAK IN- I GUESS I'LL GO FIRST- I'M DAVID CHIU BAYESIAN I'M THAT DIRECTOR OF THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND- THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY. I WAS APPOINTED DIRECTOR IN OCTOBER AND SWAP. AND HAD A CHANCE TO MEET WITH SOME OF YOU- EARLY EARLY ON THIS YEAR- HAVE MORE MEETINGS ON MY CALENDAR SO I'M REALLY OOKING FORWARD TO LEARNING MORE ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES AND WHAT THE DEPARTMENT CONSERVATION CAN DO TO HELP- I'M ADMITTEDLY NOT AN OIL AND GAS EXPERT- AS SECRETARY GRAVERT MENTIONED- MY CAREER HAS BEEN IN IN LAND USE PLANNING. BOTH URBAN LAND USE PLANNING A ROLE AND USE PLANNING. DIRECT TRYING TO COME UP TO SPEED VERY QUICK I'M SORRY ONE MOMENT WE JUST WANT TO CHECK TO MAKE SURE YOUR MICROPHONE IS ON BECAUSE IT DOESN'T SOUND I AMPLIFIED FROM HERE THE SERGEANTS ARE CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THE TELEVISION IS. STOPPING OKAY MAYBE YOU CAN JUST MOVE A LITTLE CLOSER AS WANT TO BE SURE THE TV PICTURE UP. THANK YOU OKAY. NO PROBLEM. SO I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO TAKE TOWARD COME UP TO SPEED AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- WITH- SUPERVISOR AND TAX HELP IN MY STAFF'S HELP AS WELL AS- DOING FIELD VISITS AND ACTUALLY GOING OUT TO SITES THAT SIM RICK MIDWAY SUNSET AND- SOUTH BILL RICH FIELDS. I TO LOOK AT OPERATIONS AND UNDERSTAND- OIL PRODUCTION MORE INTIMATELY- I BECAUSE INTO THE LA OFFICE NEXT WEEK AS WELL AS THE COST OFFICE THE WEEK AFTER THAT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT ABOUT ME- AS AS A SECRETARY GRAVERT MENTIONED- GREW UP IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY ON A FARM- WE GREW CROPS TO. TO FEED THE DAIRIES IN OUR AREA AROUND TURLOCK- I THEN WAS ABLE TO- GO TO UC DAVIS TO STUDY AGRICULTURAL MANAGER LIKE AN OMICS. AND THEN GO BACK AND STUDY LOCAL AND REGIONAL LAND USE PLANNING- AND THE CONNECTION BETWEEN LAND USE PLANNING AND TRANSPORTATION- AND SO MY CAREER HAS BEEN EMPHASIZING THE LAND USE ECONOMICS- AND- AND HOW TO LEVERAGE THOSE FOR BETTER LAND USE PLANNING- AND IN PARTICULAR LOOKING ON THE URBAN SIDE REALLY FOCUSING ON WAYS TO REDUCE V. M. T. SO SMART GROWTH POLICIES OF GROWING UP NOT. OUT WHICH- INCIDENTLY THAT WORK AT AT- SECRETARY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS THAT I WAS FORTUNATE TO WORK ON BECAME THE UNDERPINNING OF SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE SO. THAT'S ON THE URBAN SIDE ABOUT HAFWAY THROUGH MY CAREER I WAS ABLE TO SWITCH GEARS AND LOOK AT PLANNING FROM THE RURAL SIDE OF THE EQUATION. AND BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW TO MANAGE OUR RESOURCES. ARE NATURAL RESOURCES FOR RURAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PURPOSES- AND- ALSO TO PROVIDE ECOSYSTEM SERVICES AND SOME OF THOSE IMPORTANT ONES THAT WERE ALREADY MENTIONED TODAY- GROUNDWATER RECHARGE AND CARBON SEQUESTRATION IN PARTICULAR- SO I REALLY HAD A GREAT OPPORTUNITY OF. OF CONNECTING URBAN AND RURAL- THROUGH- THROUGH. HERE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY- TO PROMOTE MORE OF A HOLISTIC AND COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH TO PLANNING OUR FUTURE- SO. LOOKING AT MORE EFFECTIVE AND EFFICIENT LAND USE PATTERNS- PROVIDING- THAT DEVELOPMENT THAT WE NEED BUT BALANCING THAT WITH THE CONSERVATION OF OUR NATURAL RESOURCES GOING FORWARD- AND REALLY TO TRY TO AND. OF THE ECONOMIC AND- OUT FOR ALL OF US. SO WHY MY STE A LOT WITH DEPART. PROGRAM ARE TO PLANNING FOR AN INVESTING IN WORKING- LANDS I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THAT CAL JAM. IS SUCCESSFUL IN IMPLEMENTING ITS REGULATIONS- JUST TAKING A QUICK NOTE THAT WHEN DOCTOR WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN FIFTEEN. ARE THE INITIAL FOCUS WAS ON THE RELIABILITY OF HYDROCARBON RECOVERY OBVIOUSLY THAT HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY AND WE ARE NOW IF THE SIZING THE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT AND I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH SUPERVISOR AND TOOK- TO HELP HIM WITH A FURTHER IN THAT THE PROGRESS OF THAT THAT CHANGE A IN CAL JAM. AND SO TO MAKE SURE. THAT HE HAS SUFFICIENT AND WELL TRAINED STAFF WE ARE ADVOCATING FOR MORE POSITIONS A CAL JAM. I TO CARRY OUT OUR NEW MANDATES INCLUDING FEEL INSPECTIONS THOROUGH PERMIT REVIEW ENFORCEMENT DATA MANAGEMENT AND CRITICAL HUMAN RESOURCES TO ENSURE WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH. SAFETY AND THE ENVIRONMENT SO I'M GOING TO. STOP THERE SO THAT SUPERVISOR IN TECH HAS TIME I KNOW THAT WE'RE WE'RE RUNNING SHORT SO I WILL JUST POTS WITH MY COMMENTS THERE BUT I'M GLAD TO TAKE QUESTIONS GOING FORWARD THANK YOU THINK THERE'S ANY NEVER HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

ON CYCLIC STEAM ENHANCE- RECOVERY METHODS AND SURFACE EXPRESSIONS OF THE SLIDE UP THERE DOES HAVE OUR PRIORITIES IN AND TALKS THROUGH A SOME OF OUR BACKGROUND. BUT I'LL GO INTO A CYCLIC STEAM- THERE. WHAT THIS IS THE THERE'S THREE PARTS OF THE SLIDE THIS IS ONE WHILE AND DIFFERENT SCENARIOS CYCLIST IMAGE ACTION THE THERMAL ENHANCE OVER COVER METHOD.

THE SET THERE IS. THE IT IS PRINT FROM THE SAME WELL YOUNG THERE'S A PUMP UNIT AT THE SIR THIS IS A AND PROCESS THE THEY GO SO THE THREE OF THE FACT SEEM JACKSON THREE STAGES FIRST STAGE INJECTION STEAM INTO THE WELL BORE A DURING WHICH TIME OF THE RESERVOIR AND HEAT TRANSFER BEGINS THE SECOND STAGE IS A SOAK PHASE REQUIRES A WILL BE SHUT DOWN FOR SEVERAL DAYS HELLO UNIFORM HE TRANSFUSION.

SERVICE EXPRESSIONS THIS. BUS WIDER FROM THE MIDWEST SUNSET FIELD THIS AND THIS IS AN EXAMPLE OF A HIGH ENERGY INDUCED SURFACE EXPRESSION- YOU CAN SEE OUR OUR FORMAL DEFINITION OF CERTAIN SPECIAL THERE BUT IT'S BASICALLY A SURFACE EXPRESSION IS A FORM OF THE OIL SPILL THAT OCCURS WHEN ALL THE WATER COMES TO THE SURFACE OF THE EARTH OUTSIDE THE OIL AND GAS WELL STEEL AND CEMENT LINED CASING. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THERE BOTH NATURALLY OCCURRING AND HIGH ENERGY OR OPERATIONALLY INDUCED SURFACE EXPRESSIONS THE OPERATIONAL SURFACE EXPRESSIONS THAT WE REGULATE ARE ALWAYS ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH PRESSURE INJECTION OF STEAM INTO SHALLOW OIL BEARING FORMATIONS RECENT REGULATIONS GOVERNING YOU I SEE- THAT WERE INITIATED BY DOCTOR AND BECAME EFFECTIVE APRIL FIRST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- PROHIBIT LEE- BAND SURF EXPRESSIONS FROM OCCURRING. WAS PROCESS BEEN OCCURRING FOR DECADES SECOND STEAM OPERATIONS AT SURFERS EXPRESSIONS CAME INTO UNIQUE FOCUS IN THE PAST TEN YEARS- IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN WEEKS CHRISTMAS WOULD- DAVID TAYLOR AND ALSO WORKER WHO ACTUALLY KILLED WHILE INVESTIGATING SURFACE SUPPRESSION AT THE MINT SUNSET FIELD. THANKS THIS BROUGHT INCREASED FOCUS IN THE DIVISION TO THIS ISSUE EVEN THOUGH I HAVE BEEN HAPPENING FOR DECADES- BEFORE PRIOR TO THE NEW REGULATIONS TAKING EFFECT THE DIVISION RELIED ON SPECIFIC AND DIVIDE INDIVIDUAL UP PERMIT CONDITIONS INTENT TO ENSURE THE OPERATOR SHOULD BE ABLE TO PREVENT SURFACE EXPRESSIONS. THESE CONDITIONS WERE EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING THE NUMBER EXPRESSIONS BUT THEY WERE NOT DONE UNIFORMLY. OR SYSTEMATICALLY. REGULAR REGULATORY PROHIBIT PROHIBITION. MAKES A VERY PRESS OF SURF EXPRESS OF BY. OF REGULATE AT THE- OF OIL AND GAS SUPERVISOR ISSUE CIVIL PENALTIES. EVENTS OVER THE PAST SUMMER CLEARLY INDICATE THE MORE VALUATION OF HEADS OVER COVER POLICIES NECESSARY. WE DO HAVE HERE OSCAR MISTER THOMAS CALLING WITH US GOOGLE GREATER DETAILS ABOUT THE INCIDENT TIME ON ITS PROFITS FROM ALL SPUR. BUT I LIKE TO WALK YOU THROUGH A FEW SLIDES A GENERATED THE MOST ATTENTION. THIS. IS THE SUM WORKING ONE WHY- SURFACE SUPPRESSION AREA- THIS IS A CLUSTER SERVICE PRESS AT THE SUMMER OIL FEEL CALLED ONE WHY. AS YOU CAN SEE HERE THE LARGE VISIBLE FLOW. INTO A DRY STREAMBED- THAT EXPRESS WAS INITIALLY REPORTED BY CHEVRON TO CAL- YES ON MAY TENTH AS A ONE DAY EVENT- THAT WAS RECOVERED ABOUT A HUNDRED FIVE BARRELS. OF WATER AND OIL. SUBSEQUENTLY WAS REACTIVATED AGAIN ON JUNE EIGHTH JUNE EIGHTEENTH ANNA NEARBY EVENT ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD. THE RELEASE IS AFFECTED DRY SEASONAL STREAM BEDS- BUT WERE CONTAINED IN THE AREA WAS CLEANED THIS IS A TIMELINE OF EVENTS. ALL THOSE EVENTS THAT HAD BECOME ACTIVE SINCE AUGUST FIRST- AND THE CLEANUP OF THE SITE FOR COMPLETED ON OCTOBER ELEVENTH. THE TOTAL RECOVERED VOLUME OF FLUID WAS THIRTY ONE THOUSAND SEVEN OR NINETY EIGHT BARRELS OF WATER AND OIL- THAT WE SENT A LETTER TO CHEVRON IN SEPTEMBER. TENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. QUESTION EXTENSIVE pTECHNICAL REPORTS AND DATA RELATED TO CYCLE STEAM OPERATION THAT THE ENTIRE STE SOME RECOIL FEEL. OTHER PURPOSE THAT LETTER WAS ENABLE CAL JIM AND THE NATIONAL LABS TO CONDUCT A FULL ASSESSMENT OF THE FIELDS TO GAIN A HOLISTIC VIEW AND UNDERSTANDING THE CAUSES THESE MULTIPLE SURFACE EXPRESSION. AND MINORITY MISTER BRAZIER BUT I JUST. IT'S IT IS JULY TWENTY SECOND IS THAT THAT'S ACCURATE. HE SAID IT'S NOT JUNE TWENTY SECOND. THAT THE FIRST BULLET. SO IT'S JULY ST THE UNIFIED COMMAND CAME AFTER THE ORDER. WELL I'M SORRY TO INTERRUPT YOU BUT YES SO THE UNIFIED COMMAND IF THAT'S COOL CREEK JULY TWENTY SECOND. AFTER THE ORDER REFORMER MEDIA WORK AT ONE ONE. WHICH IS A CLEAR IN OUR TIMELY THE JULY ELEVENTH THE JULY TWELFTH THE ORDER TO REFORM THE REMEDIAL WORK PRECEDED THE UNIFIED COMMAND ESTABLISHMENT YES WE KNEW WE KNEW ABOUT AND ACTIONS BEING TAKEN BUT WE DIDN'T HAVE A UNIFIED COMMAND ESTABLISHED BEFORE THAT. THE IT WAS SO THAT THE RESPOND AT THE GUN IT HAD BEGUN BUT THAT THAT'S AN ACCURATE TIME LINE OKAY IT'S JUST IT'S YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT TO ORDER MEANS- IF I COMMANDER IF I COMMANDER THEY DIDN'T. GO HAND IN HAND BUT THAT BUT THAT WAS ARE AT THE RIGHT TIME. YEAH SO GOT AND NOT TO SO ASYLUM JUMP PM SO OCTOBER SECOND TWENTY NINETEEN CAL JIM ORDERED CHAIRMAN TO PAY TWO POINT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN CIVIL PENALTIES CHAMBER HAS APPEAL THE OF THAT ORDER- OR THE CIVIL PENALTIES AND IS BEING HEARD BY THE MINISTRY OF LAW JUDGE AT THE OFFICE ADMINISTRATIVE HEARINGS BUT NO RESOLUTIONS BEEN MADE YET- IF I CAN MANIMAL RIGHT OTHER REGULATORY AGENCIES REFORM TO CONTAIN THE SPILL ASSURING HUMAN HEALTH- Y. LAS SAFETY AND CONDUCT CLEANUP. AND THIS NEXT. YOU CAN SEE. SOME OF THE- ACTIONS WERE TAKEN WITH THIS IS AFTERWARDS AND OF THE CLEAN UP- BUT THE OIL CONTAINMENT SO WAS REMOVED AND AKEN TO HOUSES WASTE FACILITY- STILL POSE A SIGNIFICANT FIRST SAFETY HAZARD TO WORKERS CLEANING UP THE SITE FOR HELP PER COW CHEN REGULATIONS A PROFESSION ENGINEER WAS REQUIRED TO EVALUATE AND APPROVE STRUCTURAL GROUND STABILITY BEFORE WORKERS COULD ENTER- THE CLEANUP AREA EACH WORKER HAD- HARNESSES WITH ROPES ATTACHED SPECIAL PROTECTIVE. EQUIPMENT IN CASE OF EMERGENCY EVACUATIONS THERE WAS HEAVY EQUIPMENT THAT MAJOR ASSAULT COMPACTION- WAS SOLID BEFORE PEOPLE WALKED ON ROUTE SO THAT NO ONE WOULD FALL IN- SO THERE WAS A NUMBER AREAS BUT THERE THE- ACTION TAKEN TO MAKE SURE THE SITE WAS SAFE THROUGHOUT THE CLEANUP PROCESS. IN THAT RECENTLY. IT IS THIS AFTERWARDS- NOW IT'S OPPOSE CLEAN UP WE'VE GONE THROUGH AND ON OUR WEBSITE HAVE PUT- MAPS- INTERACTIVE MAP LISTING OF ALL SURFER DISCRETION SO TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN- THERE WAS OTHER SURFACE PRESSON MIDWAY SENSE TO ADVOCATE TRICK OF FOR ADDED MEASURE OF TRANSPARENCY- THERE'S DETAIL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE BILLS ARE WEBSITE IN AN ACT AMOUNTS FOR TRACKING- THE YOU CAN SEE HERE TO G. I. S. THAT IT HAS THE CLUSTERS OF THE DIFFERENT- SURFACE EXPRESSIONS FIELD OPERATOR LOCATIONS DATES ARE ALL ON OUR WEBSITE NOW. AND ALONG WITH A LIST OF ORDERS OF VIOLATIONS THAT WERE ISSUED. A SERVICE EXPRESSES CONTINUE POSE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO HUMAN HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENT THEY'RE DANGEROUS AND UNPREDICTABLE- THE QUARTERLY CAL JIM- COURTLY COUNTERS PLACED A MORATORIUM ON APPROVING HIGH. PRESSURE A SECOND SEEM OPERATIONS BEEN REVIEW OF THE PRACTICE INCOMES IN CONSULTATION WITH EXPERT TO THE MARCH LIVERMORE NATIONAL LAB. UNTIL CAL JIM IN CONSULTATION NATIONAL LAB THAT HAS DETERMINED. THE PROJECT USING CYCLIST INJECTION ABOVE FRACTURE PRESSURE CAN BE IMPLEMENT SAFETY SAFELY NEW PROPOSED PROJECTS USING THIS PRACTICE WILL NOT BE APPROVED. I'M MORE TORN REPLIES NEW PROJECTS AND WELLS THAT INJECTS STEAM UNDERGROUND AT OR ABOVE FRACTURE PRESSURE. WELL SPECIFIC CAUSES. A JEEP C. TO SERVE EXPRESSION STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION. INJECTION A HIGH PRESSURE IS CORRELATED WITH SURFER EXPRESSIONS OBSERVE THE SUMMER AND FALL AND SOME WORK IN THE MIDWAY SUNSET FIELDS. THIS MORE TORRENT DOES NOT AFFECT PROPOSED PROJECT THE U. CYCLIC STEAM AT PRESSURES THAT ARE DEMONSTRATED IN ACCORDANCE REGULATIONS TO TAKE PLACE BELOW THE FRACTURE PRESSURE. THESE OPERATIONS ARE NEEDED TO MAINTAIN RESERVOIR PRESSURE TO PREVENT NEW SURFACE EXPRESSIONS FROM HAPPENING AND ALSO TO PREVENT SERVICE LEVEL SUBSIDENCE FROM OCCURRING. DURING THE MOM MORE TORRENT CAL GYMNASTS ALLOWS WILL REVIEW THE PRACTICE OF HIGH PRESSURE CYCLE STEAM OPERATIONS. ABOUT FRAC PRESSURE TO DETERMINE WHETHER CAN BE PERFORMED SAFELY AND IF SO TO IDENTIFY SPECIFIC CRITERIA TO COMPLY WITH RECENT REGULATIONS. OTHER THREE REVIEW MAY RESULT A NEW SAFETY REQUIREMENTS REFLECT THE SAME ABOUT FRACTURE UPGRADED REGULATIONS. OR INDEFINITE HALT TO THE PRACTICE. AS OF THE REVIEW CAL JIM NATIONAL LOOKING TO EVALUATE. UNDERLYING CONDITIONS AT MIDWAY SUNSET FIELDS WERE SERVICE PRESS HAVE OCCURRED. THIS REVIEW WILL EXAMINE RECORDS AND PHYSICAL CONDITIONS EACH OIL FIELD- WERE SECOND STEAM ABOUT FRAC. HAS CAPEN. WITHOUT AND THEY ALSO LOOK WHERE IT HAS NOT HAPPENED A WHERE THEY HAVE A CYCLIC STEAM ABOVE. THIS BROAD ASSESSMENT CAN HELP TO DETERMINE WHAT WEATHER GEOLOGICAL AND ENGINEERING. CONDITIONS EXIST WITH A PRACTICE CAN BE CONDUCTED SAFELY IN FULL COMPLIANCE OF CAL JIM'S REGULATIONS ONCE THAT REVIEWS COMPLETE I'M GOING TO LAW. YOU'RE DOING FINE ALL RIGHT WE ALREADY HAVE QUESTIONS ALL RIGHT. I DON'T I WILL WAS THEIR- THEIR WRAP UP WHEN YOU LIKE AND WE CAN WE CAN DIG IN FURTHER CENTRO SO THAT SOME OF IT IS THE ANSWER TO SOME OF THE QUESTION GET READY THE RELEASE CAME UP. YEAH ONCE READ COMPLETE CALTRAIN WILL USE THE FINES AND- PUBLICLY THE DISPLAY THE SPOT THE FINE. OF FORM. CONSIDERATION OF NEW MP PERM APPLICATIONS. IF CAL JIM. LAB THE TERM OF THE PRICE COULD BE IMPLEMENTED PROPERLY. IN CERTAIN LOCATIONS- UNDER CERTAIN CONDITIONS THEN YOU PERMITS FOR OPERATING- OPERATIONS MEANING THESE CORRECT HERE WILL BE CLEARED FOR THE PRACTICE. AND MONITOR WHAT NEW PROPOSED PERMIT FOR THIS PRACTICE IN OTHER LOCATIONS MAY REMAIN UNDER REVIEW AND HALTED- I THINK IS AN IMPORTANT STEP TO ENSURING THE OIL PRODUCTION IS CONDUCTED AT. AS SAFELY AS POSSIBLE- AND BUT WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO- AS FAR AS YOU I SEE. YES WE DID RELEASE A- SERIES OF REPORTS PRIOR TO THE HEARING- WE DID- APPROXIMATELY SIX REPORTS OUT LAST WEEK- YOUR INVITATION LETTER. REQUESTED DISCUSSION REFORM UNDERGROUND. REFORMS UNDERGROUND JACKSON CONTROL PROGRAM YOU I SEE WE RECENTLY PROVIDE LEGISLATURE WITH SB FOURTEEN NINETY THREE REPORT. PROVIDE A SERIES OF INDICATORS ON PROGRESS TOWARD USC IMPROVEMENT. THE BIGGEST RECENT CHANGE. USE THAT I'VE ALREADY MENTIONED THE OVERHAUL THE U. I. C. REGULATIONS. THAT TOOK EFFECT THIS PAST APRIL. THE REGULATIONS MODERNIZE CLARIFY AND AUGMENT THE RIVER THE EXISTING REGULATORY STANDARDS FOR YOU I SEE OPERATIONS. OF SECULAR THESE PROVISIONS INCLUDE RICK RIGOROUS MECHANICAL INTEGRITY TESTING TO ENSURE WELLS ARE SAFE AND DO NOT LEAK. APPROVED OVERSIGHT OF OPERATION CONDITIONS AN INJECTION PRESSURES. REQUIRE ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF PROTECTION AND WELL DESIGNED. MORE TRANSPARENCY ANALYSIS OF FLUIDS FLUIDS RESERVOIRS. AND CHEMICALS USED. A COMPREHENSIVE PREVENTION AND RESPONSE REQUIREMENTS FOR SEARCH EXPRESSIONS. OCCURRENCES OR ABSENT AND PRIOR REGULATIONS. OTHER BIG CHALLENGE IS AFFECTED THE- EXECUTING IMPLEMENTING THESE NEW REGULATIONS. AND STATUTORY MANDATES YOU ACTUALLY RETROACTIVE INCLUDES A NEW PROJECT MODIFICATIONS AND PROJECT BY PROJECT REVIEWS. A PROTECTING GROUNDWATER FROM OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES WHEN CAL JOB MOST IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES. THE STATE YOU I SEE PROGRAM OF THE VEHICLE FOR MANAGING THIS. REVIEW WITH EXISTING PROJECTS IT'S CRITICAL TO ENSURING THE PROJECT COMPLY. WITH THE PROVISION OF AN REGULATE THE- IN. ARE TECHNICALLY INTENSIVE TANK INCOME THEY ALSO REQUIRE EXTENSIVE CONSULTATION WITH THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. REGIONAL WATER QUALITY BOARD PURSUANT TO OUR ENERGY TO SEE A MOVIE YOU. OF THE SIDES SLIDES IT HIGHLIGHTS THE RELEASE REPORTS I WON'T REPEAT EVEN FOR TIME BUT THEY'RE LISTED THERE. AS DIRECTOR SHOULD BASIN MENTIONED ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE CRITICAL- THE REASON B. C. P. THAT WE RELEASE AS PART OF THE BUDGET INCLUDES A WORKLOAD ANALYSIS THAT WE'RE FALLING BEHIND IN A FEW AREAS. A CAL JIM STAFF ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THESE MANDATES AND WE DO NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT- AFTER EFFECTIVE IN SB FOURTEEN NINETY THREE REPORT BOTH PROJECT BY PROJECT REVIEWS AN AQUIFER EXEMPTIONS. IMPORTANT PARTS OF MEDIAN OUR COMPLIANCE OBLIGATIONS HAVE- TAKEN LONGER THAN INITIALLY TO INTENT AND ANTICIPATED. I'M COMMITTED TO SEE CITY OF MORE. AGGRESSIVE PACE AND PARTS WERE PURSUING CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT OF THE U. S. C. PROGRAM. AS PRODUCTION DECLINED CALIFORNIA'S NINETEEN NINETY FIVE OPERATION INCREASINGLY RELIANT ON ENHANCE- RECOVERY PROJECT REGULATED BY YOU I SEE REGULATIONS- WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH CALIFORNIA'S LAWS REGULATIONS WHILE INCREASING OUR HEALTH SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFORTS. HERE IN A NEW ERA CAL JIM ORGIES IS NOW GOING THROUGH A TRANSFORMATION TO ALIGN OUR REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WAS STATES CLIMATE CHANGE AND CLEAN ENERGY GOALS. ON CONTINUE I'M COMMITTED TO CONTINUE THESE REFORMS OF THE WORKSTATION AND PEAK OF BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION TO ME OUR ENERGY NEEDS- I WELCOME. ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS. AND COMMON IN. THE FLOOR. WOW ROTH WE'RE GONNA QUESTIONS AFTER EVERYBODY ON BOTH SPEAKS MR CALL I BELIEVE I'M. GOOD EVENING MATTER FAIR. MR CULTURE MONEY ON TOM CALLING APPOINTED UP TO THE TWELVE BY GOVERNOR. AS EVEN F THE OFFICE OF SPELL PREVENT SPOT RESPONSE AND CAL APARTMENT WILDLIFE BEFORE THAT I HAD A THIRTY ONE YEAR CAREER IN THE UNITED STATES COAST COVER MY LAST ASSIGNMENT SCORES CHIEF OF RESPONSE FOR THE ELEVENTH COAST GUARD DISTRICT WHICH IS ALL OF CALIFORNIA THE ASSOCIATED FEDERAL WATERS. SO THERE WE GO. I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY REGARDING A RESPONSE THE SEVERANCE AND RICK SERVICE EXPRESSION. THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE'S OFFICE BILL PREVENTION RESPONSE ROSTER WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN. OKAY UP. CAN ANYONE FOLLOWING THE EXXON VALDEZ AMERICAN TRAITOR MAJOR OIL TANKER SPILLS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL WATERS AND ASSOCIATE NATURAL RESOURCES FROM THE EFFECTS OF SIMILAR SPILLS THROUGH ROBUST COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM OF PREVENTION PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSE ACTIVITIES. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN GOVERNOR BROWN IN THE LEGISLATURE EXPANDED OSCARS PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSIBILITIES TO PROTECT ALL STATE SURFACE WATERS COASTAL AND INLAND INCLUDING SEASONAL OR EPHEMERAL DRY WASHES. OSCAR RECEIVES MORE THAN SEVEN THOUSAND REPORTS OF OIL SPILLS EACH YEAR AND DISPATCHES MEMBERS OF OUR FIELD RESPONSE TEAMS WHICH INCLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT WILDLIFE OFFICERS ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENTISTS AN OIL SPILL PREVENTION SPECIALS TO NEARLY EIGHT HUNDRED STILL SITES PER YEAR. ONE MAY TENTH TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CALLOW YES NOTIFIED US FOR THIS BILL RESULTING FROM THE SURFACE EXPRESSION IN THE IMMEDIATE VICINITY OF. TRUMP PRODUCTION WELL ONE WHY IN SOME RECOIL FIELD IN THE TOWN OF MCKITTRICK POSSIBLY THIRTY FIVE MILES WEST OF BAKERSFIELD MR CALL I'M NOT BE BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN BUZZING UP HERE A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SLIDE. SO IT BECAUSE I KNOW THERE'S GONNA BE QUESTIONS I'M JUST GONNA STOP YOU WHILE IT'S THERE ABSOLUTELY THERE'S NO NUMBERS ON THERE THAT WE CAN READ. CAN YOU PUT THIS IN A LITTLE CONTEXT BECAUSE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS SO WHEN YOU SAY SEVEN HOW MANY SPELLS DID YOU SAY YOUR PROXY SEVEN THOUSAND PORTS A YEAR SO THIS IS A- THREE YEAR PERIOD ACTIVE. YEP TWO THOUSAND TEAM TO STOP TWO THOUSAND. IS THE LEGEND OF THESE OF. THAT CAME INTO THE ABA A WARNING CENTER CALLAWAY THAT THE SEVEN DOLLARS YOU'RE THIS REP ABOUT TWENTY ONE. YES MA'AM BILLS IN THE LAST THREE YEARS AND CAN YOU GIVE US SOME CONTACTS AS TO SIZE WHAT ARE WE TALKING ABOUT HERE THE REQUIREMENT TO REPORT IS ANY OIL TO WATER SO WE DO GET REPORTS ESPECIALLY THE MARITIME COMMITTEE WHICH IS. MORE STATUS NOW IN FAMILIAR WITH OUR- REQUIREMENTS DROPS INDIVIDUAL DROPS AND SO THAT'S WHY WE MIGHT NOT SEND A TEAM TO THE SCENE OF A DROP AND WE WERE NOT GONNA FIND ANYTHING SO JUST SO THAT WOULD TOTAL. CONTACTS YES. WHAT'S THE RIGHT I SO I WITH THE BOTTOM RANGE YOU GOT THE DROPS OF WATER. THE RANGE WHAT'S COME OF AB. OF WHAT SEEING IN THE CPO. PROBABLY BETWEEN TEN. AND HUNDRED. WITH BE THE AVERAGE. MOST OF THE REPORTS ARE ON A TANKER TRUCK. INCENSE ON HIGHER AND ASK. ON WE ALSO HAVE PROBLEM A BIT INTO. FEST ARE WHAT. ON THAT MIGHT MAKE ST OR WITH. TITLE A START BREAK OPEN THAT AN ISSUE THAT WE'RE ALL. SO HOW MUCH OF THIS IS YOUR DOT. INTO RELATED THAN. A FOR. COMP MAN TRIED I'D HAVE TO GIVE A ON. APPROXIMATE I IT'S A OF FAIRLY LOW NUMBER COULD. TO A LOT LOT OF THE ROUTE. THAT WE GET. OTHERS ALL RULES THAT WILL ALLOW. INDUSTRY TO WHEN WE CALLED FIELD WILL. ON THE IF IT'S WITHIN CAN. THEY HAVE TO. IF IT'S I BELIEVE FIVE TWO TWENTY. OR THERE'S MORE THAN THAT IS YOU ON HERE. OUR NUMBER COULD BE. RIGHT OKAY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MA'AM. ALI SO WHERE WAS I WAS SO BACK TO. INITIAL POOR OF A THIS DECEMBER WILL HEARD WE INITIALLY. BARRELS OR ABOUT. HUNDRED OF A MIXTURE OF CRUDE OIL AND OPERA. WA OSCAR DE. RESPOND SMARTBAY. FIELD OFFICE TO THE SITE AND THEY RE. GAVE WITH SEVERAL. DOG AT THE TIME AND CLEAN UP CON. IN THE US. MONTHS. THERE WAS NO STANDING OR FOR WATER WITHIN. AN I'M SORRY I NEVER YOU ALSO TIME LINE ON THAT. IF YOU GIVE US THE IN DATE TO WE GO HERE INITIAL. SAYS WITH A MAKE. I WATCH AS YOU USE ON THE CLEAN A PICTURE. RESTATING THERE'S NO STANDING WATER OR FLOWING WATER WITHIN MILES OF THE SPILL AND ALTHOUGH WAS IN THE VICINITY OF ENDANGERED AND OTHER SPECIES HABITATS THERE WERE AT THE TIME NO OBSERVE WILDLIFE IMPACTS NEVERTHELESS WHILE IF AVOIDANCE MEASURES WERE PUT INTO PLACE AND AS A RESULT OF OSCARS INITIAL EVALUATION OF POTENTIAL A WILDLIFE RISKS. THERE WAS NO DANGER TO THE PUBLIC OR OTHER STATE WATERS. THE SITE WAS CHALLENGING GIVING SERVICE EXPRESSION SOMETIMES ASSOCIATED WITH VERY UNSTABLE SURROUNDING TERRAIN INCLUDING SINKHOLES THE PERCENT OF POTENTIALLY LIFE THREATENING RISK. CONSEQUENTLY A SAFETY BUFFER WAS ESTABLISHED AROUND THE EXPRESSION THE PROHIBITED PERSONNEL FROM ACCESSING THIS BILL AREA. ADDITIONALLY THERE WAS ALWAYS THE THREAT OF EXPOSURE TO EXTREMELY TOXIC HYDROGEN SULFIDE GAS. ON JULY TWELFTH KQED PUBLISHED IN THE ASSOCIATED PRESS PICKED UP A STORY OF THE SENATE SPILL REPORTING EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND GALLONS SPILLED OVER TWO MONTHS. THIS UNDERSTANDABLY TRIGGERED A BARRAGE OF INCREASE FOR THE NEW ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE OTHER MEDIA AND STAKEHOLDERS. AROUND THE SAME TIME THIS BILL WAS DEEMED SAFE ENOUGH TO COMMENCE SPILL RESPONSE ACTIVITIES AND OFFER DOGGER ESTABLISHED A FORMAL UNIFIED COMMAND WE HAVE BEEN RESPONDING AT THIS POINT SIR BUT NOW WE FORMALIZE IT MORE THROUGH THE ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF INTEREST. IN ADDITION TO DIRECTING RESPONSE ACT ACT ACTIONS. THE UNIFIED COMMAND ESTABLISHED A REGULAR REPORTING OF RESPONSE UPDATES TO THE PRESS AND STAKEHOLDERS. GOVERNOR NEWSOME SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND MANY OTHERS VISIT THE SITE AND SAW FIRST HAND THE EFFORTS AND CHALLENGES OF THIS RECOVERY OPERATION. AS PER RESPONSE PROTOCOLS OSCAR WAS THE STATE ON SCENE COORDINATOR TOGETHER WITH DAUGHTER AND PARTICIPATED IN LIAISON AND JOINT INFORMATION CENTER ACTIONS. OSCAR LED THE ENVIRONMENTAL UNIT WHICH ADVICE THE UNIFIED COMMAND REGARDING ALL ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS INCLUDING ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING AND IT'S AN ASSESSMENT WASTE STREAM MANAGEMENT AND CLEANUP STRATEGIES AND POINTS. OFFER ALSO LET A WILDLIFE FRANCE TO MINIMIZE AND RESPOND TO WILDLIFE IMPACTS. WELL IF OF ONCE MEASURES INCLUDING HAZING SPECIFICALLY NOISE PRODUCING ZAHN GUNS AND HIGH INTENSITY LIGHTS. AS WELL AS EXCLUSIONARY FENCING TO PREVENT WILDLIFE FROM GETTING INTO THE OIL AREA. FULL TIME BIOLOGICAL MONITORING WAS CONDUCTED DURING THE DAYLIGHT AND AS MANY AS NINETEEN TRAIL CAMERAS WERE EMPLOYED AT NIGHT TO MONITOR NON TERM. I'M SORRY NOCTURNAL SPECIES. THREE OIL BARN OWLS AND ONE OIL LESSER NIGHTHAWKS WERE CONFIRMED KILLED BY THIS BILL. ADDITIONALLY ONE WORLD RAVEN AND ONE OIL COTTONTAIL RABBIT WERE CAPTURED CLEANED AND RELEASED. HOWEVER ANALYTICAL FUEL FOR FINGERPRINTING DID NOT CONFIRM THAT THE OIL IN THESE ANIMALS WAS FROM SOME RECORD WHY. DURING THE RESPONSE THROWN OVER FLIGHTS RECORDED THE TRACKS OF ONE MEDIUM SIZE MAMMAL THAT HAD CROSSED TO THE OIL AT NIGHT BUT THAT AND THE ANIMALS NEVER DIRECTLY OBSERVED. ON OCTOBER NINTH CONTRACTORS ACHIEVED CLEAN UP AND POINTS AND THE UNIFIED COMMAND WAS TO ESTABLISHED SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE REACTIVATION IF NEEDED. IN THE SUBSEQUENT MONTHS THROUGH PRESENT THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL ADDITIONAL EXPRESSIONS FROM ONE WHY AND OTHER NEARBY WELLS AN OSCAR HAS ALWAYS RESPONDED TO VERIFY APPROPRIATE RESPONSE ACTIVITIES AND WILDLIFE RECONNAISSANCE AND PROTECTIVE MEASURES. OSCAR CONTINUES TO FORGE STRONGER PARTNERSHIP WITH A CALIFORNIA GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT ISN'T. AS WELL AS OTHER STATE FOR ANNA INLAND REGULATORS LIKE THE STATE FIRE MARSHAL FOR PIPELINES AND PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION FOR RAIL. OUR OILED WILDLIFE CARE NETWORK MANAGED BY THE WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER AT UC DAVIS HAS EXPANDED ITS WILDLIFE FREE HAVE NETWORK TO MORE THAN FORTY SENATORS WITH AN EMPHASIS ON BRINGING NEW INLAND FACILITIES ONLINE. I IS THE MINISTRY TO RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR ME TO PERSONALLY SCHEDULED VISIT SENIOR ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS AND LEGISLATORS TO FROM YOUR FAMILIARIZE THEM WITH OSCARS MARITIME PREVENTION. AND STATEWIDE PREPAREDNESS AND RESPONSIBILITIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES. MOST SENIOR GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS ARE FAMILIAR WITH THE MATTER THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND CAL WE MANMADE. EMERGENCIES BUT THE WAY THAT WE RESPOND BY FEDERAL AND STATE LAW AS THE STATE'S TRUSTEE ONE OIL SPILL DIFFERENCE IN IMPORTANT WAYS FROM THESE OTHER TYPES OF RESPONSES. OIL SPILLS HAVE DESIGNATED STATE AND FEDERAL ON SCENE QUARTERS FOR MáS FOR IN THE U. S. COAST GUARD USEPA DEPENDING ON WHERE THE SPILL OCCURS. AND DECISION MAKING DOES NOT START AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. OSCAR CONTINUES TO WITH YET SOME PREVIOUS SEVEN IS. TO CLAY THESE DISTINCT. AND WORK TO ENSURE AN EFFECTIVE IN CORE NEED RESPONSE AND OPEN LINES COMMUNICATION. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SELECT I BELIEVE YOU NEXT. A EVENING CARE CHAIR FREED. I GUESS. I KNOW MY OF THE JOINT LAY COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE ARE TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT THE C. PREVENT OCCURRED YEAR WHY IT HAPPENED WHAT OUR RESPONSE. AND HOW WE ARE TO SICK NAY TO IT FROM A- I AM BILLY LOCKERBIE VICE. SHALL SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY BE UNIT. I OVERSEE THE CO. THERMAL DATA MIGHT OFFER. IN CURRENT CAN. I WAS DEEPLY INVOLVED IN THE SHOW IN CHEVRON'S EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP WHAT WE REFER TO AS THE SIM RICK ONE WHY SEAT. I WORKED IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL AGENCIES INCLUDING CAL JIM ASA PER AND THE KERN COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES DEPARTMENT. ALSO HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF ACCOMPANYING GOVERNOR NEWSOME AND MISTER MARSHALL WHEN THEY VISITED THE SAME RICK FEEL LAST JULY. CHEVRON IS OPERATED IN CALIFORNIA AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. WE HAVE A LONG LEGACY OF SUPPORTING OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE CURRENTLY EMPLOY MORE THAN SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE STATE. AS WELL AS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CONTRACTORS. OUR OPERATIONS GENERATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS EACH YEAR AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE FOR THE COMMUNITIES WHERE WE OPERATE. THE ENERGY INDUSTRY AND CALIFORNIA EMPLOYS FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND PEOPLE WHO EARN AN AVERAGE OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR. AND MANY OF THESE WORKERS DID NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A HIGHER EDUCATION. ALL TOGETHER CALIFORNIA'S OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY REPRESENTS 36% OF THE STATE'S TOTAL DAILY OIL CONSUMPTION. AND CONTRIBUTES ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUE. HISTORICALLY STATEWIDE THERMAL DATA MIGHT PRODUCTION HAS MADE UP JUST OVER 10% OF THE STATE'S DAILY PRODUCTION OF OIL. CHEVRON'S THERMAL DATA MIGHT OPERATIONS SPAN THREE FIELDS IN CALIFORNIA IN A DRY REMOTE PART OF KERN COUNTY ABOUT ELEVEN MILES LONG AND TWO MILES ACROSS. THERE'S NO SOURCE OF DRINKING WATER IN THE FIELDS AND THE CLOSEST TOWN IS FOUR MILES AWAY. AS CONFIRMED BY THE AGENCIES OVERSEEING THE CLEAN UP LAST YEAR'S EVENT DID NOT IMPACT PUBLIC HEALTH OR DRINKING WATER IN ANY WAY. WE TAKE OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO OPERATE SAFELY AND IN A MANNER THAT PROTECTS PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT VERY SERIOUSLY. WE FULLY ACCEPT AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR ACTIONS RELATED TO THE ONE Y. VAN. TO THIS END WE ARE COMMITTED TO STOPPING AND PREVENTING SEEPS CONSISTENT WITH THE STATE'S REGULATIONS ADOPTED LAST APRIL. AND WE ARE MAKING GOOD ON OUR COMMITMENT. WE HAVE IMPLEMENTED AND CONTINUE TO ENHANCE IMPORTANT SAFEGUARDS INCLUDING TWENTY FOUR HOUR SURVEILLANCE TECHNOLOGIES AND EARLY DETECTION PROTOCOLS. TO HELP US IDENTIFY POTENTIAL SEEPS AND TO PREVENT THEM. WE CONSTANTLY MONITOR GROUND MOVEMENT THROUGH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES LIKE TILT METERS AND SATELLITES WITH AERIAL IMAGING. AND WE VALIDATE GROUND STABILITY AROUND ANY ACTIVE SEAT BEFORE ALLOWING PERSONNEL OR EQUIPMENT TO MOVE INTO THE AREA. TODAY AS IN YEARS PAST WE ARE ABLE TO PREVENT VIRTUALLY ALL SEATS AT THE SAME RICK FIELD. THE ONE Y. EVENT THAT OCCURRED LAST MAY WAS A NOTABLE EXCEPTION. WE BELIEVE IT WAS THE RESULT OF A WELL RE ABANDONMENT. A WELL RE ABANDONMENT IS WHEN WE DO ADDITIONAL WORK ON A PREVIOUSLY ABANDONED WELL IN ORDER TO ENHANCE WELL INTEGRITY AND ULTIMATELY REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR SEAT. WE REGULARLY CONDUCT WELL RE ABANDONMENT AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME AT CP AS OCCURRED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS TYPE OF ACTIVITY. SAFETY IS FUNDAMENTAL AT CHEVRON. UPON FIRST IDENTIFYING THIS STEEP ON MAY TENTH WE TOOK IMMEDIATE ACTION TO PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. FIRST WE ASSESSED AND CONFIRM TO SAFETY OF OUR EMPLOYEES I CONTRACTORS AND THE PUBLIC AND EVALUATED HOW BEST TO CONTAIN THE SEAT. WE DIDN'T NOTIFY THE APPROPRIATE STATE AGENCIES AND WORK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE REGULAR UPDATES TO LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS. AND OTHER COMMUNITY MEMBERS AND TO DETERMINE THE BEST PATH FORWARD FOR CLEAN UP IN RESPONSE. WORKING IN CONSULTATION WITH THE AGENCIES WE PUT IN A BERM TO CONTAIN THE AFFECTED AREA AND TO PROTECT THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT. WE ALSO TOOK STEPS RIGHT AWAY TO PROTECT WILDLIFE. FROM THE ONSETWE WORKED IN CONSULTATION WITH OFFERED TO PUT IN PLACE MULTIPLE MEASURES TO KEEP BIRDS AND OTHER WILDLIFE FROM ENTERING THE AREA. DURING THE ONGOING RESPONSE WE WORKED AS PART OF UNIFIED COMMAND TO IMPLEMENT WILDLIFE PROTECTION MEASURES LIKE FENCING AND NOISE DETERRENCE. IN ALL AREAS OF THE CLEAN UP. AND WE HAD FULL TIME BIOLOGICAL MONITORS WORKING ON SITE. DESPITE THESE AGGRESSIVE MEASURES WE REGRET THAT FOR BIRDS DID LOSE THEIR LIVES. ON OCTOBER ELEVENTH OF LAST YEAR UNIFIED COMMAND CONFIRMED THAT THE CLEAN UP WAS COMPLETE. OUR FOCUS SINCE THEN HAS BEEN ON A CORPORATION LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE ONE Y. ADVANCE TO REASSESS AND ENHANCE OUR FIELD WIDE ABANDON THE PROGRAM. THIS INCLUDES REASSESSING ALL WELLS INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN ABANDONED. SO THAT WE CAN INSURE WELL INTEGRITY ACROSS FIELD OPERATIONS AND PREVENT THIS TYPE OF EVENT FROM HAPPENING AGAIN. IN ADDITION TO THE ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN IN RESPONSE TO THE ONE Y. EVENT. WE ALSO HAVE A TEAM OF OVER FIFTY TECHNICAL EXPERTS WORKING TO IMPLEMENT A HOLISTIC FIELD WHY PLAN DESIGNED TO PERMANENTLY STOP WHAT IS REFERRED TO AS GS FIVE SEAT. AT ARTS IN RICHFIELD. WE ARE WELL UNDERWAY WITH THIS PLAN. AS PART OF OUR COORDINATED EFFORTS WITH CAL JIM TO STOP THE GS FIVE SEAT SUMMARY ACTIVATIONS ARE RELEASES HAVE OCCURRED AND MIGHT STILL OCCUR. OUR COMMITMENT TO PERMANENTLY STOP THIS SEAT OUTWEIGHS THE POSSIBLE RISK OF A SHORT TERM STEEP ACTIVATION. THE DAY GS FIVE IS THE ONLY ACTIVE SEAT AT OUR SIMMERING FEEL. WE RECOGNIZE TO THAT THE STATE HAS TAKEN A NUMBER OF ACTIONS INTENDED TO ENHANCE OVERSIGHT OF CYCLIC STEAMING AND THERMAL DATA MIGHT. INCLUDING IMPLEMENTATION OF A MORATORIUM ON NEW WELLS AND AN INDEPENDENT STUDY TO ASSESS THE SAFETY OF EXISTING WELL. WE FULLY SUPPORT TAKING A SCIENCE AND DATA BASED APPROACH. TO EVALUATING INDUSTRY OPERATIONS AND BEST PRACTICES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE IN THIS PROCESS INCLUDING SHARING DATA AND INFORMATION. FOR LAWRENCE LIVERMORE LAB. I'D CHEVRON WE ALSO UNDERSTAND SHARE THE CONCERNS OF CALIFORNIA OTHER GOVERNMENTS AND THE PUBLIC ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE. WE ARE COMMITTED TO ADDRESSING THE RISK OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHILE CONTINUING TO DELIVER THE AFFORDABLE RELIABLE EVER CLEANER ENERGY THAT BENEFITS CALIFORNIANS AND CONSUMERS AROUND THE WORLD. GEN RUN IS TAKING ACTION TO MANAGE OUR GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS BY LOWERING THE COMPANY'S CARBON EMISSIONS INTENSITY. INCREASING OUR USE OF RENEWABLE ENERGY AND INVESTING IN FUTURE IN A IN THE FUTURE TO TARGET BREAKTHROUGH TECHNOLOGIES. AS A COMPANY WE CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN A WIDE RANGE OF TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING EXPANDING EVEY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURES IMPROVING BATTERY TECHNOLOGY AND ADVANCING CARBON CAPTURE. ACHIEVING CARBON NEUTRALITY IS A GLOBAL ISSUE AND WE ENCOURAGE THE STATE TO THINK BROADLY WHEN SETTING A CARBON NEUTRALITY POLICY AND DESIGNING PROGRAMS TO ACHIEVE EMISSIONS GOALS. WE ARE COMMITTED TO BEING AT THE TABLE TO HELP FIND AND BE PART OF THE SOLUTIONS. AS WE MOVE FORWARD CHEVRON WILL CONTINUE TO BE FORTHCOMING AND RESPONSIVE TO ALL LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES. WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR REGULATORS TO ADDRESS ANY ISSUES- IN OUR THERMAL DATA MY FIELDS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK TO ALL OF YOU- BECAUSE MR STERN AND I ARE TAG TEAMING THIS WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO NOW. IS WE'RE GOING TO ASK SOME QUESTIONS FOR THE AGENCY MEMBERS AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO ASK MR LOOK KOBE SOME QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL MOVE ON TO MY COLLEAGUES AND LET THEM ASK QUESTIONS- SO I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR THE AGENCY MEMBERS AND I'LL LEAVE IT TO YOU. AS TO WHO ANSWERS I THINK I THINK ONE OF THE LEAST SPECIFIC TO MR COLUMN. OF FIRST HOW MANY WELLS IN CALIFORNIA YOU ARE ARE YOU AWARE OF THAT ARE USING HIGH PRESSURE STEAM TO BREAK UP OIL FORMATIONS BELOW THE GROUND. AND COMMUTERS ARE CLARIFY ALSO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BREAKING THE OIL FORMATIONS WITH HIGH PRESSURE STEAM DIFFERENT FROM HYDRAULIC FRACKING. AND SHOULD OPERATORS BE REQUIRED TO ALSO COMPLY WITH WELL STIMULATION REQUIREMENTS. THAT'S THE FIRST CLASS ONE QUESTION. RABBITS THREE QUESTIONS UP IN ONE QUESTION. RIGHT SO LET ME. THE IS A- GOOD WALK TO A INTO THE BUT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. A DRUG FRACTURING CYCLIC STEAM. UP SO THIS IS. THERE BOTH. YOU MIGHT CONSIDER ENHANCE COVER STIMULATE TECHNI WITH. HYDRAULIC FOR YOU HAVE HYPER. OR PROP OR SEEN. THAT'S INJECTED INTO A WELL BOARD I ITS PURPOSE CREATING NEW FLOW CHAIR INTO THE- USUALLY IT'S FOR- ROCK DOESN'T HAVE THE PROBABILITY OR THE ABILITY FOR FLUID TO FLOW THROUGH IT THERE IS SOME OF THE DIANA MIGHT- GEOLOGY OUT THERE IF YOU DRILLED A WELL LIKED. TO DEAL WATER WELL YOU COULD DRILL IN THE WATER WOULD COME OUT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY FOR THE FLU THE FLOW WITHOUT. A CRACK IN THE ROCK- HIGH PRESSURE CYCLIC STEAMER CYCLIC STEAM HAVE A SHOW DOES NOT HAVE ANY PROP INTO THE HONEY. KIM IN IT IT A STEAM SO IT'S VAPORIZED WA THAT GOES IN THE GROUND A IT CREATES IT HEATS. THE FOR MAKE. AND SO IT'S A IT'S A STIMULATION TECHNIQUE OF HE MIGHT THINK OF CHANGING. IT'S CALLED THE SCOTT CITY MOLASSE TO. THE WAY THE FOR THE BILL OF MOLASSE TO FLOW. ARE HONEY TO FLOW VERY SLOW BUT HE'D UP IT CHANGE BUT SCOTT HERE IN A GOES DOWN. IN CAN FLOW MORE LIKE WATER THE SO ACTUALLY THE- NOW IT NOT IT A GOOD THROUGH JOB JUST TO WALK GOES INTO A SPONGE. THE STATE GOING TO A AND THE POOR. AND THE SUBS INTERVAL AND HELLO HOUSE FOR THE FOOD HELLO TO THE WOBBLE. IT'S A TO THE AMICK PROCESS CHANGE SECONDS. THAT FORMATION PER. A HEATER FOR HOTTER FOR THE HYDROCARBONS THE FLOW TO THE WELL BORE- IN THREE OF THE SO IT'S- IT'S IT IS. MANY WITH FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT PROCESS IT IS NOT COVERED UNDER ITS BEFORE AS A- WELL STIMULATION TECHNIQUE- IT IT'S NOT REGULATED THAT WAY DO YOU HAVE TO KEEP. INJECTING THE STEAM TO CONTINUE THAT PROCESS ORDERS IT CAN THERE IS A CONTINUE BY ITSELF NATURALLY ONCE THE STIMULATION HAPPENS. IT SO IT THE SO THE CYCLIC STEAM SOMETIME CALL HUFF AND PUFF- HAS THE PART PARTS TO A IF YOU DIDN'T THE STEAM IN THEIR YOU. HAVE NATURAL TO FLOW BACK INTO THE WHILE- IN IT WAS A NATURAL ENERGY THERE'S NO PUMP THERE'S NO SECTION- IT JUST YOU OPEN THE VALVE THE TOP OF THE FOOD COMES OUT. AND SO IN SOME WAYS IF YOU DIDN'T PUT THE STEVEN THERE IT WOULDN'T REACT THAT WAY I WOULD ONE DAY IN THE CURRENT IN. THIS HOW LONG HAVE HOPE I'M WONDERING IF IT CHANGES THE ABILITY FOR THE- MATERIAL TO SORT OF WANT TO REACH THE SURFACE PERMANENTLY OR FOR A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TIME. I'M NOT IN A- YEAH NOT AN OIL ENGINEERS YOU HAVE TO. KNOW I. MEAN IT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION I NOT HEARD. BEFORE OF THE ABOUT THAT WAY BUT IT. I MEAN THAT YOU PUT. HAVE US. ISSUES THAT IF THE POOR SPACES NOT. A REFILL THAT YOU'RE CREATING VOIDS ARE EMPTY SPACE THAT CAN. WITH THAT THE OVER. OF THE PRESS OF THE CROWN ABOVE IT. SLOUGHED NOT AS PA THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHEN THE QUESTION CAME UP LIKE WHY NOT LOW PRESSURE CYCLIC STEAM. BECAUSE HE'S BEEN TO THESE WHEN HE TO PROTECT. OF THEIR- HOW. IN A RELATIVE HOT TEMPERATURES THE SUBSURFACE. THEY TAKE DECADES- TO COOL DOWN AND SO. MUCH OF THE RESERVOIRS ALREADY HOT AND SO IF YOU JUST STOPPED. EVERYTHING WHOLESALE YOU'RE GONNA HAVE. TRIGGER POTENTIALLY SERVICE EXPRESSIONS- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE SUBSIDENCE OF CRACKS AT THE SURFACE- AREAS- THAT WOULD CONCAVE AND- IT. IT IT IT IT WOULD BE WAS CALLED BAD RESERVOIR MANAGEMENT. CRAYONS CONDITIONS. POTENTIAL TRIGGER ADDITIONAL SIR. PRESS THAT WE DON'T TO DO. SO PER. IS INTENSE ENOUGH THAT IT IS CHANGE. THE LOCAL MAKE. UP OF THE FORMATION BELOW. FOR DE. IT THROUGH THE HE IN. AND THEN THE FLU MOVE. SO FLUID AND BUT IT'S A- SOME LIKE ALL MACHINE. THAT YOU KNOW YOU EVERY TIME YOU INJECT THE STEAM THE GROUND IT GOES A DIFFERENT FLOW IN. DIFFER PART OF THE JOB IS NOT A YOU. ADJUSTER AND- OF FINGERING OR DIRECT. SO EVERY TIME YOU DO IT YOU YOU YOU STEAM HIT THE PART OF THE UNDERGROUND. AND SO IT'S THIS ENTERED OF PROCESS- BUT IT IT IT CHANGES BY THE NATURE THE FLUID COMING OUT GROUND IS THE IS THE PHYSICAL CHANGE. FOR ME AS THE SOME OTHER RECENTLY. MADE SERVICE EXPRESSIONS HE LEGAL HOW MANY SERVICE EXPRESSIONS OF WE HAVE. FROM THE BEGINNING OF TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TELL NOW. TWO THOUSAND. TRY NOW. I THINK I HAVE. SO IN ADDITION TO THE ONE Y. THERE'S A SERVER CLUSTER. THERE'S ALSO AIR COMIC MCPHEE THIRTY SIX AREA- THEIR TOTAL EIGHT VANCE IN THE IN THAT IN THE SURFACE EXPRESSION AREA OTHER ON OUR WEBSITE. OTHER THIRD CLUSTER AROUND CASE STATING FIVE- WHICH OF TWO TWO EVENTS. THE SPECIFIC NUMBER. LOOKS LOOKS ABOUT ON THE TWENTY. SERVER EXPRESSION RANGE SO GIVEN THAT THAT THIS IS IT MAYBE LEGAL BECAUSE WE DON'T WANT THEM TO HAPPEN. ARE THE PENALTIES FOR THAT ACTION SUFFICIENT- GIVING THAT THE SERVICE EXPRESSIONS ARE STILL CONTINUING. YEAH AND YOU YOU HAVE DIFFERENT- TYPES NATURE TO SURFACE WITH RUSSIAN SOME CAN BE MEDICATED SAFELY WHERE THERE'S A BERMAN ISOLATED A YOU CAN- DO WHAT'S CALLED A VACUUM TRUCKER BACKTRACKED THE SUCK UP THE FLUIDS WHERE IT'S IN A VERY SMALL AREA- WE DO HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO CIVIL PENALTIES IT'S AT THE DISCRETION OF STATE SUPERVISOR- OUR LARGEST- A SERVER EXPRESSION THAT WAS- AT. THE SUMMER WAS THE LARGEST CIVIL PENALTY THAT WE'VE ISSUED FOR SERVICE RIGHT I GUESS I'M ASKING IT'S CONTINUING DO YOU THINK THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE STRONGER PENALTIES. I THINK PENALTY IS ONE BUT ALSO IS FIRST TIME REQUIRED TO DO ABOUT. REPORT BACK TO IT WERE INCLUDED IN OUR FIELD INSPECTIONS. WE HAVEN'T HAD THE CAPACITY TO RESPOND IN THE PAST- WE ALSO ARE- HAVE HAD OUR RULES IN AND PROVED TO DO CIVIL PENALTIES A STRONGER ENFORCEMENT WE DO HAVE AN ENFORCEMENT UNIT- WE DO HAVE MORE ATTORNEYS OR AND WORK IN OUR OFFICE IT GOT IT. THE DAY WEREN'T THERE THREE FOUR YEARS AGO. THAT'S GREAT THANK YOU. MISTER CALL MY A QUESTION FOR YOU TO QUESTIONS THE FIRST IS WHAT ARE THEIR ENDANGERED ANIMALS WITH THE NEAR THIS PARTICULAR FIELD. YES MA'AM. WHAT ARE THOSE. MORE EFFECT MY CALL GREG BACK THERE COULD. GIVE A SHOT I GREG. BOX KIT FOX RIGHT THERE'S WAY. BIG DIFFERENCE FOR YOU OKAY. THERE THERE ARE WE'RE WHERE AG JUST NEED TO DO ANY AT THIS FOR THE WHILE PLAY. HALL WHERE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THE PICK THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RARE TIME WORLD AND THE AND A AND EVERY DAY THAT WE OUT THE- ON. LIKE THIS MAY WE'RE WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE DEBATE PATTERN WORKING WITH OUR ARE IN WHEN WE OF THOUGHT WELL THINK YOU. TO LEARN ABOUT THIS AND- I THINK. BY VIRTUE THE LOWER NUMBER WHICH I SURPRISED OF US OF A THE DOOR IF AND THEY WERE. THE BIRDS AND WE AND FEW MAMMAL. ON I WOULD I THINK THE IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT'S OF THE BROWN TECTUM LIKE THE ON GUNS IN THE FENCE. GIVEN THE SAME CONCERNS WITH OUSTER THE CRY. ON WORKED. IT'S COMMON TO SEE WILDLIFE AND WE HAVE A OF A CHEMICAL LABORATORY- IN- RITUAL HEARD OVER WHERE WE CAN ACTUALLY TAKE FRANTICALLY THE OIL YOU KNOW FROM THE- FROM YOU THE OTHER CARCASS OR THAT THE LIVE ANIMAL. AND TRY TO CHEMICALLY FINGERPRINT MATCH IT TOO AND IN THE CASE OF THE TWO I MENTIONED IT WAS NOT CONCLUSIVE TO POINT BACK TO THIS PARTICULAR EXPRESSION SO DOES THAT GIVE OFFICIAL WHILE BY A FOR ANY OTHER AGENCY PAUSE THAT IT'S- COMMON TO SEE. BOILED AND DYING ANIMALS OR DEAD ANIMALS OF COURSE. MMHM AND IS I MEAN TO YOU WHAT MEASURES TO TAKE TO TRY TO PREVENT THAT. HALL WELL AGAIN AGAIN WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT AND- AN EXAMPLE BE SOME OF THE ON THE PONDS THAT THE MAJOR OIL COMPANIES ARE. OUT MIGHT HAVE THEY'LL THEY'LL PUT NETTING OVER THE TOP TWO OF OCT TO TRY TO KEEP BIRDS FROM GOING AND I WOULD SING THAT SHINING SURFACE AND COMING IN TO LAND FIGURE MIGHT BE WATER. ON A AND OCCASIONALLY- THERE MIGHT BE A TEAR IN THE NET OR SOMETHING IN THEIR IN THEIR BE BIRDS OF THE WHAT WE CONSIDER AN ILLEGAL TAKE AND WILL- TAKE YOU KNOW. START INVESTIGATION ACTUALLY TAKE CIVIL ACTION AGAINST TOM A COMPANY THAT THAT THAT'S EXAMPLE OF WHAT OF WHAT WE WOULD DO. I'M THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR LET'S WALK THROUGH. LET'S START LET'S START FOCUSED ON SAM RECKON WILL ASSUME OUT A LITTLE BIT BECAUSE I'VE BIGGER QUESTION ABOUT THE OVERALL PERMITTING FRAMEWORK BUT- ONLY BACK TO THE TIMELINE. THIS IS PART OF WHAT. RECORD THE NEED FOR THIS HEARING IN THE FIRST PLACE IS THAT- IT WAS VERY CONCERNING TO ME THAT WE NEEDED. THE NEWSPAPERS TO MAKE AN ISSUE OUT OF THIS IN ORDER FOR IT TO ACTUALLY TRIGGER UNIFIED COMMAND YOU SAID. YOURSELF A MISTER COLIN I BELIEVE YOUR WORDS WERE. YET THE THAT THAT THE NEED TO. BUT SAY. NO NO I KNOW THE TIMING I'M JUST I'M JUST TRYING TO REMEMBER LIKE YOU WERE SAYING THE ACTUAL NEED FOR UNIFIED COMMAND WAS TO DEAL WITH THE MEDIA FIRE STORM NOT WITH THE INCIDENT ITSELF WELL CENTER THAT'S WEIRD SOUNDS BUT TO REASSURE YOU ON THE FORMATION THE UNIFIED COMMAND IN JULY DID IN NO WAY SPEED UP THE RESPONSIBLE FREE OF OIL FOR THE MONITORING OF WILDLIFE WE STARTED MAY TENTH WITH THE INITIAL REPORT AND SEEING THAT THERE WERE AT THE TIME WAS THE TWELVE HUNDRED GALLONS OR SO IN THE ENVIRONMENT. TAKING RESPONSE ACTIONS VERIFYING THAT CHEVRON AND THEY'RE CLEANING CONTRACTORS WERE ON TASK AND DOING THE THINGS THEY NEED TO NOW- BEING WHERE IT WAS AND pTHAT THERE WAS NO WATER AND AT THE TIME I CAN USUALLY NO WILDLIFE IN AND MINIMAL OF CONCERNS YOUNG AT THE BEGINNING WITH SMALLER VOLUME. ROM YEAH WE DIDN'T THE NEED TO MOBILIZE A BUNCH OF PEOPLE DOWN THERE- YOKE ON THIS. BUT WHEN IT HIT THE MEDIA IN WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION WITH LOTS OF QUESTIONS ON WHAT'S GOING ON DOWN THERE- WE NEEDED THE THAT ONE ELEMENT OF THE UNIFIED COMMAND TO THE LIAISON. TO REACH OUT TO- PO TO ALL LOCAL CONCERNS SALE NGOS AND SO FORTH. AND THE PUBLIC INFORMATION SIDE TO REPORT. ON WHAT WE ALREADY HAD BEEN DOING AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO DO. BUT IF THE MEDIA HAD REPORTED ON THIS. IS IT FAIR TO SAY THAT THERE MAY HAVE NEVER BEEN ANY PUBLIC DISCLOSURE OF THIS BILL OR THE RESPONSE. I WOULDN'T SAY IT WAS A OP WE WERE HOLDING BACK ON THE- BUT YOU'RE NOT REQUIRED UNDER LAW TO PUBLICLY DISCLOSE- THAT THAT KIND OF CONTACT LIKE AYE. AYE MR LACK BE MENTIONED THAT THEY CONTACTED CALLOW YES THAT'S REQUIRED UNDER LAW FOR CERTAIN TYPE TO SIR FIX EXPRESSIONS YES SIR BUT THEN IN RESPONSE. ASPER OR CALORIE AS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY PUBLIC DISCLOSURES UNDER UNDER CURRENT LAW NO THE ONLY JOB REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IF THE YACHT THAT WAS PUBLIC SAFETY CONCERNS A SHELTER IN PLACE- QUALITY ON THOSE KINDS OF THINGS YOU KNOW- OTHER AGENCIES BESIDES US FOR YOUR WOULD DEAL WITH THE PUBLIC HEALTH ASPECTS. OF IT NO THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT- I'D HAVE TO LOOK BACK ON. WE DON'T HOLD BACK AS MY AFFECT WE VERY PROUDLY. PUT OUT AND SOCIAL MEDIA FACEBOOK TWITTER INSTAGRAM SO FORTH. ON MOST OF OUR RESPONSES SO I. WOULD NOT BE AT ALL SURPRISED IF. IN THAT PERIOD BETWEEN MAY AND JULY IF THERE WAS SOMETHING THAT WE PUT OUT THERE. WE CERTAINLY WEREN'T AWARE OF IT IF YOU DID PUT IT OUT THERE AND- IT'S SIX I MEAN. IN THE ABSENCE OF DISCLOSURE QUESTIONS ABOUT. SO I WOULD AYE AYE I WONDER GOING FORWARD- EVEN IF YOU ARE DOING A SOLID JOB OF RECOVERING EVEN IF THERE IS ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE- TO CALLOW YES- THE ABSENCE OF THAT. TO THE PUBLIC NOTIFICATION- IT SEEMS LIKE AN ISSUE THAT WE AFTER RESOLVE HERE- IF I MAKE SENATOR ON THESE I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND YOUR POINT ARMED. I THINK ONE OF THE MAJOR TRIGGERS FOR US IS CERTAINLY- ANY TYPE OF OIL WATER SURFACE WATER INTERACTION- AFFECT AND OF COURSE SOME AFFECT WILDLIFE. OF WELL THIS IS WHAT IS CONSIDERED A BLUE LINE JUST BY THE NATURAL. ON A CARVE OF THE TERRAIN IT IS CONSIDERABLE LINE MEANING THAT AT SOME POINT IN THE FUTURE AND YOU KNOW IN MAY IN JULY. IN MCKITTRICK THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE THE DISTANT FUTURE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE WATER FLOWING THROUGH THERE. ON THEIR WHAT'S IN THE PERCEPTION THAT ON THAT THERE NEED TO BE A BLAST OUT THAT YOU KNOW HERE'S THIS BIG SPILL ON BEGAN BECAUSE WE'RE MORE CONCERNED WITH WATER WE DIDN'T. SLOW DOWN- MAKE IT A LOWER PRIORITY TO RESPOND ONLY UNDERSTAND THAT AND I GUESS I'M TRYING TO GET AT. TRYING TO BUILD SOME KIND OF TRUST SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH- SUCH A HUGE EXERCISE EVERY TIME I'D SAY BOTH FOR. THIS CASE THIS IS WHAT THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMITTEE PROBABLY HAS IN THEIR INTEREST AND I WOULD SAY PROBABLY INDUSTRY IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO BE. AS FORTHCOMING AS POSSIBLE AND IF THERE IS DISCRETION TO MAKE THOSE DISCLOSURES- IT SEEMS- PRUDENT BUT IF THEY NEED IT YOU HAVE WE NEED TO SORT OF LOOK AT. REQUIRING ANY THAT DISCLOSURE WE'RE HAPPY TO UNDERTAKE THAT EFFORT AT EIGHT I WANTED TO. IN ADDITION TO THAT THAT TIMELINE I DID I DID WANT TO ASK CAL JIM THOUGH- THIS OF THE PERMIT SURFACE EXPRESSION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN- A REQUEST FOR AN AQUIFER EXEMPTION IN THIS EXACT FIELD WAS GRANTED BY CAL CHEN- MINUTE LEAST ON IN PART IN PART OF THE BASES THAT. OF MISTER COLIN NOTED THAT THE INJECTED FLUID WOULD. IN IN YOUR ESTIMATION ROOM REMAIN QUOTE IN THE AQUIFER OR PORTION THE AQUIFER THAT WOULD BE EXEMPTED. SO. IN TERMS OF. FURTHER REQUEST UNDER WAY SO- WE KNOW GS FIVE YOU MENTION IS ON GOING. HOW MUCH OIL DO WE THINK HAS EITHER SPILLED OR LEAKING- BEEN PRODUCE PRODUCE FROM THESE AUTHORIZED SURFACE EXPRESSIONS- OVER THE PREVIOUS YEARS OTHER ESTIMATES I DON'T KNOW IF I'M ASKING THE RIGHT AGENCY MAYBE OSPREY MAYBE CAL GYM BUT YOU HAVE AN ESTIMATE. OF HOW MUCH WAS ACTUALLY HAS BEEN SPILLED LEAGUE PRODUCED- THROUGH SERVICE EXPRESSIONS OF PASTORS REGARDS WEATHER TOUCHES WATER WILDLIFE OR NOT I KNOW YOU WENT THROUGH THE- SORT OF. TOTAL NUMBER YEAH I'M I'M TRYING TO THINK ABOUT GALLONS HERE OR BARRELS WHAT. I CAN GIVE YOU A SECOND THAT ONE IF YOU WANTED IF YOU WANT TO CONSULT CAN ALSO GET BACK TO THE COMMITTEE THE EIGHT EIGHT YOU KNOW THE LONGER TERM- GS FIVE. BILLY PROBABLY COULD ACT ANSWER HOW MUCH HAS COME OUT OF THERE BUT I GUESS I'M SAYING THAT. OVERALL STATE WANT WHY. FROM YELLOW TO GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT OKAY WE DON'T HAVE AND THEN THE OTHER SORT OF STATEWIDE QUESTION WAS HOW MANY. HOW MANY DRILLING PERMITS IS CAL JAM ISSUED SINCE SAY- TWENTY EIGHTEEN. TO PICK A DATE I GOT THAT. DRILLING PERMITS SENSE TWENTY EIGHTEEN. SO YES. DRILLING PERTH REALLY PERMITS. SAYS LIKE NEW DRILLING RIG DRILLING RE WORK. WELL AT LEAST YEAH I GUESS UNDERNEATH THAT YEAH I MEAN HOW MANY FOR WELL STEM OR A. K. A. FRACKING AND HOW MANY FOR NEW CYCLIC STEAM BUT THE BIG NUMBERS THE ONE I WAS MOST INTERESTED IN. FOR CHECK DON'T HAVE A BROKEN OUT THAT WAY. I DO NOT ALTER THEM REELING PERMITS- I HAVE IT LOWER. CURRENTLY BUT NOT FOR THE TWO YEARS CAN COMPARE BOTH FOR EACH CATEGORY I CAN GET THOSE TO YOU THOUGH OKAY. ENDS. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY PERMITS FOR INJECTION. JUST WITH AN INJECTION CONTACTS HAVE BEEN ISSUED YES. I HAVE WELL STIMULATION PERMIT TOTALS. DEBBIE THE YEAH MORE THE FRACKING CONTEXT I'M SAYING. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT THE U. I. C. STAFF IS SAYING FIVE FIVE NEW PRO TO OKAY LAST FRIDAY FOR SURVIVOR MEANT. IT'S NOT IT'S KIND OF CHEATING YOU YOU YOU CAN ANSWER THE QUESTION. BUT THAT'S YEAH EXACTLY BUT THAT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GET AT THE INDIVIDUAL PERMITS THEMSELVES. JUST TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF THE SCOPE OF ACTIVITY THAT IS UNDER WAY A CAL JIM. THE QUANTITY OF. OIL THAT'S BEEN EMERGING FROM SURFACE EXPRESSIONS WRIT LARGE YEAH BUT BUT AT LEAST- OF NEW DRILLS- AND THE LAST PRESS FOR YEAR AND A HALF IS BEEN. ABOUT NEW DRILLS OKAY- STATEWIDE WITH THAT ARE VARIETY OF AREAS INJECTORS- WASTEWATER DISPOSAL- STEAM STEAM FLOOD. BUT THERE AND I DON'T HAVE CATEGORIZED BY WORK OVER. GOT OR BUT- YEAH OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED YOU SAID SIXTEEN HUNDRED OR SO FIFTEEN NINETY FIFTEEN NINETY. AND AM I ASKING THE RIGHT PERSON IS A YOU ARE MISTER CALLING ON THE WHO WILL GET BACK TO US ON THIS- THIS SORT OF OVERALL SERVICE EXPRESSION HOW MUCH HAS BEEN SPILLED IN CALIFORNIA GALLON TWICE. WE WILL CERTAINLY WORK WITH A WITH CAL GERMAN THAT CENTER ON ONE POINT POINT THAT WELL I'M GONNA COME BACK IF I MAKE LEAST LIKELY YEAH PREVIOUS QUESTION YEAH ALL OF THESE REPORTS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CATS ARE ABLE GET AVAILABLE OF COURSE ON THE WEBSITE. YOU KNOW- SO WOULD BE THERE'S NONE OF THIS IS THE OLD BEHIND ANY TYPE OF FIELD FENCE OR WHATEVER. THERE'S A ON ANOTHER POINT THAT LIKE CAR OFFSHORE WATERS I ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA YEAH ON THE INLAND ALSO HAS NATURAL SEEPAGE AND- AND MY COLLEAGUE FOR CHEVRON- DIS TOLD ME THAT JUST IN THE- THE CATCHER KARI ALONE THERE'S TEN NATURAL SEEPS SO. ON THE- WILDLIFE FEEL THAT WE MIGHT HAVE THE CUT RABBIT. ON STATES THAT HAS SOME SOME OIL ON IT COULD HAVE COME FROM SHORT ONE WAS THAT AND WE KNOW IT WE KNOW THERE'S ALL WE'VE SEEN THE BEVERLY HILLBILLIES LIKE I SAID. YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF OIL IN THIS STATE BUT BUT HOW MUCH FROM NON NATURAL I MEAN THAT'S TAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET AT HERE TOO AND THE CONCERN I HAVE IS THAT EVEN THE LOW ENERGY TRIGGERED SURFACE EXPRESSIONS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY COME FROM THAT HIGH PRESSURE CYCLIC STEAMING. HOW MUCH ARE WE NOT. GETTING AT RIGHT NOW AND THAT MAYBE THIS IS WHERE MISTER LACKEY BE MIGHT HAVE SOME INSIGHT- BUT I KNOW IT'S GOING TO BE LIMITED. TO CHEVRON AND I'M TRYING TO GET SORT OF. THE BROADER. SCOPE OF THE ISSUE HERE. RESHAPE THAT ANALYSIS BROUGHT BACK TO WORK COMMITTEES BECAUSE I THINK. WE WANT TO SCOPE THE PROBLEM. WE DON'T WANNA CHASE- YOU KNOW ISSUES THAT AREN'T THERE ARE RISKS THAT DON'T EXIST BUT- THE FACT IS IN THIS CASE WE GOT A LITTLE BIT LUCKY. RIGHT WE WEREN'T NEAR- AN AQUIFER- MINIMAL WILDLIFE AND COMMUNITY IMPACTS BUT- I GUESS I WANTED TO KNOW FROM. A THE R. PETROLEUM ENGINEER SEEMS LIKE THE BEST PERSON ASK BUT- MITCHELL I COULD BE MENTION. CONCERN ABOUT THIS WELL RE ABANDONMENT POTENTIALLY BEING. WHAT I FOR BETTER LIKE BETTER TERM A ROUTE COSTS- THAT BEING THEIR SORT OF CURRENT CONJECTURE DO YOU DO YOU SHARE THAT THAT OPINION AT THIS POINT. NO WE DON'T KNOW YET WE ARE EVALUATING AND STILL- AS ONE OF THE AREAS WORKING WITH THE NATIONAL LABS UNDERSTAND COMPLEXITY- AYE AYE I'VE NOT SEEN DOCUMENTATION FOR CERTAINTY THAT WHAT THE CAUSE OF THIS BILL. AND SO WITHOUT PREJUDICING THAT ANALYSIS THAN. IT IS THERE IS THERE A CONCERN ABOUT SERVICE EXPRESSIONIST VICTIM THE OVERALL FIELD INTEGRITY HERE IS THAT SOMETHING YOU'RE LOOKING AT IS THE IMPACT AND I AND I TAKE THAT TO MISTER LOCKE B. AS WELL BUT- YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. IF IT'S JUST SIMPLE WELL REVETMENTS ONE THING. BUT IF THIS SURFACE EXPRESSION ISSUE IS SORT OF PRODUCT PART OF A BROADER TREND THAT AFFECT OVERALL FIELD INTEGRITY- IS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT WHEN YOU'RE- DOING YOUR ANALYSIS. THIS IS SPECIFICALLY WHAT WE ARE WE'RE LOOKING AT WITH THE NATIONAL LABS DURING THE MORE TORRENT HERE IT IS WHY IS THIS HAPPENING WEARS A HALFPENNY. WHERE IS IT NOT HAPPENING AND WHY- SO THAT WE CAN HAVE INFORMED REGULATORY DECISIONS OKAY- BUT WE ARE ALSO WORKING TOGETHER ON A REMEDIATION PLAN. TO BRING TEMPERATURE DOWN AT-SOME WRECK- THAT WERE- CHEVRONS INJECTING IS APPROVED BY CAL JIM TO INJECT LOWER TEMPERATURE WATER. TO LOWER THE TEMPERATURE THE RESERVOIR- THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING FOR ABOUT THE LAST SEVEN WEEKS. VERY SEEN ABOUT A I WHICH WE BELIEVE WILL HELP ALLEVIATE A AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE SURFACE EXTRACTION OKAY. AND THEN- MY LAST A QUESTION WAS WHAT I HAD TO SECTOR CROWE FOR ABOUT. JUST THE PAY OF OVERALL YOU I SEE. PROJECT BY PROJECT INSPECTION ARE YOU ALL ARE YOU SATISFIED AT THIS POINT WITH THE PACE THE WORK. NO AND YOU WERE ACCURATE WAS NINE- IT IS HOLE IS WILLIAM ATTIC INADEQUATE AND- I AM- COMMITTED TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING IT- MAKING SURE WE PUT THE RESOURCES ON THAT- ONE OF THE KEY THING FOR US TO THE BUDGET. JEFF BCP OF TRYING TO GET NEW POSITIONS THAT WE HAVE THE RESOURCES- BECAUSE WE HAVE A LOT OF FOLKS ARE WORKING TWO OR THREE JOBS. I WE HAVE A LOT OF VACANCIES RIGHT NOW THAT WE'RE NOT ABLE TO FILL BECAUSE OF OUR HIRING FREEZE. OF THE WE'RE SPENDING OUR- WHAT THE LEASE OUR SAVINGS ON OUR NATIONAL LAB STUDIES. IN THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AND SO WE- WE'RE WE'RE VERY CONSTRAINED AND WOULD LIKE TO DO MORE- BUT WE NEED DISSONANCE RESOURCES WHY. I INTEND TO. ACT ASSIST IN THAT EFFORT THROUGH BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE BUT I DO WANT TO GET A SENSE I HAVE REVIEWED THE B. C. P. AND I KNOW THERE'S NOT A BUDGET HEARING BUT- TIMELINE TO I'D ASK THE SECRETARY THAT BUT- IN YOUR- IN YOUR IDEAL WORLD. YOUR B. C. P. IS BEEN PROPOSED SAY THE LEGISLATURE GRANTED. WHAT WHAT CAN WE TELL THE PUBLIC WHAT IT WHICH OF THE EXPECTATIONS BE IN TERMS OF JUST A TIME LINE FOR. REVIEW AND MAYBE A PRIORITIZATION METHOD THAT YOU'VE GOTTEN MIND AT THIS POINT. YEAH THIS IS THIS IS THE AREA THATSEVERAL CURRENT TECHNICAL VACANCIES AND- IN THE B. C. P. IT'S A THREE YEAR PHASE IN. A HALF IN THE FIRST YEAR AND ANOTHER KIND OF QUARTER QUARTER THE SECOND AND THIRD YEAR. OF COURSE AN IDEAL SCENARIO WE LOVE IT ALL YOUR ONE- BUT WE REALIZE THAT WE WORK IN- THE PUBLIC SECTOR AND- AND HAVE TO. USE YOUR RESOURCES WHETHER AGENCIES- BUT IT'S A IT IS A- EFFORT- THAT I'M FOCUSED ON- IN THE LAST. FEW WEEKS. I'VE BEEN VERY VIGOROUS VIGOROUSLY PUSHING TO GET SOME OF THESE BACKLOG REPORTS OUT- SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO MOVE ON THE NEXT LEVEL. OF THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS IMPLEMENTING THEM WE APPRECIATE THAT AND- AND- I MEAN I GUESS. I DON'T FORCE YOU TO. DRILL DOWN PARDON THE PUN BUT TO DEEPLY. ON A ON A SUPER SUPER PRECISE TIMELINE BUT MEAN WE LOOKED AT FOR INSTANCE THE CCSD REPORT THAT RECOMMENDED SET BACKS- FOR- EXTRACTION NEAR FRONTLINE COMMUNITIES. I'D THERE'S TALK OF FIFTEEN HUNDRED FEET TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED FEET BUT AT LEAST FOR THE U. I. C. INSPECTION PROCESS CAN YOU GET CAN YOU TACKLE THAT CHUNK OF PROJECTS WITHIN THE YEAR WITH ADEQUATE FUNDING. AND I'D LIKE H	A AND WE ASK WHAT IS THAT UNIVERSE OF YOU I SEE WITHIN RANGE OF COMMUNITIES I KNOW THAT MAY BE OUTSIDE OF THE SCOPE OF THE SIM RICK CONVERSATION BUT- WHAT CAN WE EXPECT. WHAT WHAT'S A REASONABLE EXPECTATION FOR THIS YEAR ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE FOLKS WHO LITERALLY LIVE NEXT ORDER WE HAVE A LIST ALREADY OUT THE PUBLIC- THINGS ABOUT FIFTEEN PROJECTS SAID- WE COULD MOVE ON. THAT ARE VARIOUS LEGAL AND TECHNICAL STATES- THERE ALSO ARE- ONES TO HAVE TO HAVE PUBLIC HEARINGS THOSE WHO HAVE HAD PUBLIC HEARINGS AND VARIOUS- STAGES OF THE PROCESS- AND SO- MORE NEW REVIEW OR FOR EXISTING. LISTING OKAY YEAH AND IT I THINK YOU'LL BE VERY DIFFICULT TO PUT A NUMBER ON FOR THIS YEAR TIMELINE ON IT THE HOW MUCH HOW LONG DOES IT TAKE TO DO. THIS ONE PROJECT WHAT WHAT WHAT'S A TAKING HE SAID HEARING THIS PROCESS. WHAT WHAT'S A TAKING YOU ALL RIGHT NOW ON AVERAGE DIVA SENSE MRS MATTER MONTHS. AYE AYES A MATTER OF A DEAR PER PROJECT IF WE HAVE THE APPROPRIATE- STAFF I THINK MATTER MONTHS THIS PURPOSE RAJA PROJECT AND IN THEORY YOU COULD GO IN PARALLEL THEN WHICH WITH A NUMBER OF PROJECTS GOING TO ONCE INSERTED DIFFERENT. CAL JAM EMPLOYEES RIGHT. OKAY HOW WOULD WE ALSO HAVE THE HIGHER GEOTECHNICAL PROFESSIONAL GASSED IN THIS AT THAT WILL COME INTO THE STATE WITH THE- LOWER. POST PEPPER OF RETIREMENT YEAH. WITH THIS SOBERING- SIZE OF A TASK SO WILL BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS BUT I REALLY. I WANT TO TRY TO BE HONEST WITH PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN EXPECT TO LIVE IN THESE COMMUNITIES- I KNOW IF HELP IS NOT ON THE WAY AND THEY DON'T KNOW WITH THE PROJECT YOUR VIEW THEY SHOULD KNOW THAT TOO- I. THAT THAT WAS THE MAIN OF MY QUESTIONS AT THIS. ALTHOUGH I GUESS. IN ORDER ON THAT SET BACK QUESTION TO ME IS THAT SOMETHING THAT THEY CAL JIM HAS BEEN LOOKING AT- I KNOWS IN RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THAT CCSD REPORT. IS THAT WHAT WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT YOUR YOU SAID A HEALTH AND SAFETY PROCEEDING I'M SORRY I THINK WAS A PUBLIC HEALTH CARE HEALTH REAL MAKING US RIGHT TO IS THAT. IS THAT WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THAT PROCEEDING IN TERMS OF ANALYZING. WHERE THERE MAY NOT BE A- RESPONSIBLE OPERATOR HAVE YOU KNOW THE IMPACT IN RISK AND COMMUTER I. SPENT MOST OF THE LAST TWO YEARS OF WORKING ON THIS ISSUE INTIMATELY IN LOS ANGELES YEAH- THERE'S MULTIPLE WAYS THAT YOU CAN DO- A POTENTIAL SET BACK- WE ARE COMING IN WITH NO PRECONCEIVED NOTION OF HOW TO IMPLEMENT SUCH. OR A SET BACK AT ALL BUT IN OUR- OR REVIEW AN OUT REACH NO LAST MONTH- WITH MORE THAN TWO DOZEN- NGO GROUPS- THAT IS OVERWHELMING THE REQUEST THE PEOPLE HAVE TO BE INCLUDED. AND I ANTICIPATE WILL BE INCLUDED THROUGH OUR PUBLIC HEALTH. OF PRE RULE MAKING A FORMAL RULE MAKING PROCESS- I GOT A- COUPLE QUESTION MISTER LUCKY BUT I'LL TURN IT BACK TO MEMBERS IF THEY WANNA. FAVORITE INDULGENCE- I'LL ASK MR LOCKERBIE A FEW QUESTIONS AND TURN IT BACK TO YOU TO ASK MISTER WALKER IS A QUESTIONS AND THEN TO MISS LOAN TASK. ANYBODY'S QUESTIONS THAT YOU ONCE. AND THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE LONGER WE TAKE THE MORE MEMBERS LEAVE. SO REALLY THE MORE OR LESS QUESTIONS YOU END UP WITH SO THERE'S SOME YOU KNOW SORT OF A GOOD NEWS BAD NEWS KIND OF THING- SO I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR YOU- FIRST OF ALL THE ADMINISTRATION IS HOLD WITH THE APPROVAL OF PERMITS- USING HIGH PRESSURE STEAM. AS WE'VE HEARD OVER AND OVER AGAIN- HOW MANY OF CHEVRON'S TO QUICK STATE WELLS. EMMERICH USE HIGH PRESSURE STEAM TO BREAK FORMATION. SO THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WE HAD. TO HUNDRED AND TWO. ACTIVE IN THE- X. THAT WOULD HAVE QUALIFIED FOR CYCLIC STEAMING- ALSO THOUGH AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR WE HAD NO ACTIVE- STEAM INJECTION ONGOING IN THE FIELD AT ALL. AS SUPERVISOR- LOCK- SPOKE TO. WE'RE TRYING TO COOL THE RESERVOIR DOWN RIGHT NOW. AND SO WE'RE INTRODUCING WATER INTO IT- TO COOL DOWN THE RESERVOIR AND NOT STEAM RIGHT AND DID THE WELL THAT YOU WERE ABANDONING GO THROUGH ANY FORMATION THAT HAS HAD HIGH PRESSURE STEAM INJECTED INTO IT. THE WELL- YES THE WELL THAT WE WERE DOING THE REAL BAND IN THE JOB THAT WE WERE LATE THE- THE SEAT TO- AT SOME POINT IN TIME IT WOULD HAVE BEEN ON CYCLIC STEAM. RIGHT SO I GUESS THE BIG QUESTION THAT STILL HAS TO BE ANSWERED IS HOW MUCH DID THE HIGH PRESSURE STEAM CONTRIBUTE. TO THE SERVICE EXPRESSION AND THAT'S STILL UNDER INVESTIGATION THAT STILL WHAT WE'RE LOOKING INTO CORRECT AND WORKING WITH AGENCIES ON THAT PARTICULAR- TOPIC. DOES THE STEAMER YOU INJECT HAVE ANY CHEMICAL ADDITIVES OR IS IT JUST STEAM. NO TYPICALLY THE STAIN THAT WE'RE GOING TO PREP TO INJECT- YOU NEED PURIFIED WATER IF IT'S NOT PURIFIED AND AT THAT POINT IF FORM SCALES AND WHAT HAVE YOU SO IT'S TYPICALLY PURE WATER THAT WERE FORMED A STEAM WITH- AND THEN MY LAST QUESTION FOR YOU SEE HOW EASY. MY LAST QUESTION IS- I WAS JUST CURIOUS BECAUSE YOU MENTIONED THAT YOU WERE CURRENTLY APPEALING THE PENALTIES THE CIVIL PENALTIES AND I'M JUST WONDERING- GIVEN THAT. YOU KNOW YOU. DID SAY THAT YOU'RE ACCEPTING RESPONSIBILITY. ON WHAT GROUNDS ARE YOU APPEALING AND ALTES SO THERE'S- A COUPLE OF THINGS FOR ONE THE TIME PERIOD THAT WE HAVE- I'M TWO. GUS YOU KNOW WHAT. IN THE ORDER IS VERY LIMITED SO IF YOU WANTED TO US THAT. AND I THINK THE TEN DAYS YOU HAVE RISK. AT THAT POINT YOU HAVE TO APPEAL. TO OUR LEGAL WE HAVE WHAT WE HAVE THEM CONCERN WITH- IS THE WAY THE ART OF WAS WRITTEN THAT IT SAID THAT WE HAD- PRESENTED AND I'M GONNA PAIR FACE HERE- SIGNIFICANT- THREAT. TO HUMAN HEALTH OR TO THE PUBLIC HEALTH. SO IT'S NOT THE FINANCIAL AMOUNT THEN THAT IS UNDER- YOU KNOW DISPUTE ON YOUR MIND IT'S MORE OF THE FINDINGS OUR BIGGEST CONCERN IS THE WAY THAT IS WRITTEN. AND AGAIN I WANT TO TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY AS WELL TO POINT OUT EVEN THOUGH WE APPEALED AT NO POINT THAT WE STOP WORKING YOU KNOW IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE AGENCIES. YOU KNOW FOR THE RESPONSE FOR THE CLEAN UP AND TO STOP GS FIVE YEAH I WAS JUST I'M CURIOUS BECAUSE YOU KNOW. THERE IS A CIVIL PENALTY AND IT'S IT. IT IT SOUNDED LIKE THE APPEAL WAS ABOUT THE CIVIL PENALTY- AND BUT YOU'RE SAYING IT'S MORE ABOUT THE- THE FINDINGS ABOUT THE- THE IMPACT ON PUBLIC WORLD AND WHAT THAT MIGHT LEAD TO LATER ON AND- THAT MAKES SENSE. TO ME. A YOU WERE ABLE TO SELL OIL THAT WAS EXTRACTED FROM THE SPILL CORRECT. SO THE ACTUAL. AT ONE WHY- THE WAY WE PROCESS THAT OIL THAT WAS REMOVED- THERE FROM THE DRY STREAMBED IS IT EVENTUALLY MADE IT THROUGH OUR PROCESS FACILITY. RIGHT AND IS THAT- AMOUNT OF. PROFIT OR REVENUE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT WHEN THE PENALTIES ARE ASSESSED. I DON'T KNOW HOW WAS ASSESSED I CAN'T SPEAK TO THAT I CAN TELL YOU THAT WE SPENT- MORE THAN NINE POINT TWO MILLION DOLLARS SO FAR AND IF YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE REVENUE THAT WOULD BE GENERATED- BY THINK IT'S SIXTY- SIX THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED BARRELS THAT WAS ASSOCIATED THEIR OF OIL. WE TAKE A LOOK THE REVENUE THAT'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IT PALES IN COMPARISON TO THE NINE POINT TWO MILLION WE SPENT ON THE RESPONSE I'M DEFINITELY NOT SUGGESTING THAT YOU ARE HAPPY THAT YOU HAD THE SERVICE EXPRESSION DON'T GET ME WRONG. I'M JUST TALKING ABOUT I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE SO THE NEXUS BETWEEN THE AMOUNT OF THE PENALTY AND- A KIND OF- FUTURE- JUST YOU KNOW. OF DISCOURAGEMENT FOR YOU KNOW SERVICE EXPRESSIONS AND YOU KNOW AT I THINK ONE OF THE OTHER THINGS BESIDES THE PHYSICAL LOCATION THAT WERE. GLAD THAT IT HAPPENED IN THIS PARTICULAR LOCATION IS THAT IT WAS CHEVRON TO AN OPERATOR THAT HAS THE WHERE WITH ALL IN THE ABILITY TO DO A REALLY GOOD JOB WITH CONTAINMENT AND CLEANUP SO. I'M NOT AT ALL- DISPUTING ANY OF THAT. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU WITH THAT I'LL TURN IT OVER CHARGES STERN THANKS- SO ALL THE ALL THE OF TAIL ON THE QUESTION I POSED TO THE ADMINISTRATION. REGARDING WELL REMAIN IN MINT VERSES- SIR GEOLOGICAL INTEGRITY SO YOU'RE SAYING YOU THINK IT'S AT THIS POINT SHOULD BE ABLE TO WELL RE ABANDONMENT BUT- EXPLAIN IS WHY YOU DON'T THINK. THAT THE SERVICE EXPRESSION WOULD LEAD TO A LOSS OF SAY GEOLOGIC INTEGRITY FOR THE FIELD OVERALL LIKE WHAT WHAT GIVES YOU SO IN THIS PARTICULAR EXAMPLE- WE BELIEVE THAT ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW IT WAS THE RE ABANDONMENT THAT- THERE WAS A COMPROMISE PORTION OF THE WELL BORE THAT WE WERE WORKING ON WITH THE RE ABANDONMENT AND THAT CREATED A PATHWAY TO THE SURFACE THAT IN THE COMING OUT IN THE DRY STREAMBED. DUE TO ITS VICINITY TO THE SURFACE IT'S M<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt;&lt;/c&gt;</u> SHALLOW AND WHICH IS KIND OF THE PATH OF REACH LEASE RESISTANCE- YOU REFER TO YOU KNOW THE ENTIRE FIELD- AND AGAIN YOU KNOW THIS IS ONE VERY SMALL PINPOINTED PORTION OF THE FIELD- MATTER OF FACT WHEN YOU TAKE A LOOK AT THE PICTURES THAT WERE SHOWN EARLIER- BE IMPACTED SOIL IS ABOUT ONE ACRE IN- IN A FIELD THAT IS TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES. SO YOU KNOW IT IT'S QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE THERE AS FAR AS WHEN YOU LOOK AT THIS ONE EVENT COMPARED TO THE SCALE OF THE ENTIRE FIELD. AND SO WHEN YOU'RE SAYING ONE EVENT IT'S THE IT'S THE EVENT I GUESS ITS REPORT NINETEEN THIRTY FORTY ACCORDING THAT TIME LINE AS THE MATE WHEN IT WAS REPORT ON MAY TENTH YET THAT'S CORRECT. AND THEN SO THE OTHER REPORT THOUGH ON JUNE EIGHTH THERE WAS THE- RE. ON EIGHTEENTH IN ADDITIONAL EVENT REPORT ON JUNE TWENTY THIRD- USING THAT'S ON IN YOUR ESTIMATION UNRELATED TO THE TO THE MAIN EVENT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY'RE ALL RELATED THAT THEY'RE ALL RELATED TO. A AT THE SIMILAR SEAT- INITIATION IF YOU WILL IT'S JUST DIFFERENT FLOW LOCATIONS THAT THEY ARE FLOWING OUT OF. BUT THE LET'S CALL THE JUNE EVENT FOR LACK OF A BETTER TERM IT'S NINETEEN THREE SIX SIX EIGHT BUT- THAT. YOU'RE TREATING THAT TO WILL RE ABANDONMENT AS WELL CORRECT SO ONCE AGAIN AS THAT PATH STARTED MIGRATING UP TO THE SURFACE WE BELIEVE THAT IT BRANCHED OFF INTO SOME OTHER AREAS THAT IT CAN'T MOVING TO POINTS OF LEAST RESISTANCE. BECAUSE THE ORIGINAL FLOW SITE A RECENT POINT WERE EQUIPPED FLOWING AND THEN YOU HAD OTHER FLOW SITES THAT HAD STARTED. SO WE THINK THE FLOW ITSELF WAS STILL ABOUT THE SAME IS JUST COMING OUT OF DIFFERENT LOCATIONS. SO WE'RE LOOKING FOR IT I MEAN DO YOU ANTICIPATE THE NEED TO DO CONTINUOUS FLUID INJECTION OF SOME SORT REGARDLESS OF THE EFFORTS TO COOL THE FIELD OFF RIGHT NOW BUT IN TOWARD IN. IN ORDER MAINTAIN SOME GEOLOGIC INTEGRITY TO THIS THERMAL DATA MIGHT DO YOU THINK THERE'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE A SORT OF. CONTINUOUS EFFORT FOR. FLOODING STEAMING SOME KIND OF- SOME KIND OF ON GOING WORK NO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION I THINK THE PRIMARY GOAL IS GOING TO BE THE JUST A MASS BALANCE OF WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU'RE TAKING OUT YOU HAVE TO REPLACE IT IN THEIR- SO. AGAIN IF YOU'RE GOING TO EXTRACT- OIL AND RESERVOIR FLEW IT THEN IT'S SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE THERE TO REPLACE IT WHEN YOU'RE DOING THE- CYCLIC STEAMING- YOU HAVE THE STEAM THAT'S GOING AND THEY'RE COLLECTING AND REPLACING THE FLUIDS THAT YOU'RE REMOVING. IF YOU GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU SAY I DON'T WANT TO STEAM ANYMORE AND YOU'RE GOING TO TRY TO COOL THE RESERVOIR OFF LIKE WE'RE DOING NOW. BEEN IN THAT POINT WERE INTRODUCING WATER- TO MAKE SURE THAT WERE BALANCING THAT. WE ARE MONITORING TO FEEL VERY CAREFULLY FOR ANY SORT OF GROUND MOVEMENT AND WE DO THIS WITH TILT METERS THAT ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE. AS WELL AS THE- SATELLITE IMAGERY TECHNOLOGY- THAT ALSO MEASURES IT ANYTIME WE SEE ANY SORT OF SUBSIDENCE THEN ONCE AGAIN WAT WE DO IS GO AND ALTER THE INJECTION RATE SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T GET. OUT OF HAND OR OUTSIDE OF THE PARAMETERS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO KEEP IF WE START SEEING UP LIVE. LIKEWISE WE MOUNTED WE START TO MODIFY THE INJECTION AND WE CAN ALSO MODIFY THE WITHDRAWAL RATE AS WELL IN CAN YOU. LACK OF FOR LAYMAN'S TERMS CAN YOU. YOU CATCH UP FAST ENOUGH IF YOUR TILT METERS ARE SAYING HEY THERE'S A PROBLEM. ARE YOU I MEAN WE DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE FEROCITY IN THE INJECTION RATES BUT I MEAN CAN YOU CATCH UP QUICKLY ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY. PREVENT MASSIVE SUBSIDENCE IN TIME- MORE. SO THE PARAMETERS THAT WE LIKE TO STAY WITHIN OR LESS THAN TWO INCHES OF SUBSIDENCE PER YEAR SO IT'S NOT A LOT OF MOVEMENT AND THESE ARE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE AND WE CAN. NOT CATCH UP BUT WE CAN- MONITOR AND MAINTAIN TO WHERE WE MINIMIZE THE GROUND MOVEMENT- THAT'S VERY POSSIBLE- WE'VE HAD SOME CHALLENGES- WHEN THIS SEEPS TOOK PLACE THERE WERE STEAM BLOCKS THAT WERE PUT. AROUND THE ACTUAL STEEP SITES. THAT ARE THERE CALL WHAT STEAM BLOCKS. STEAM BUT IT'S A RADIUS AT WHICH YOU ARE NO LONGER CAN INJECT- OR OR CONDUCT THE CYCLIC STEAMING OPERATIONS AT ONCE AGAIN THAT PRESENTS SOME CHALLENGES THAT ON THAT MASS BALANCE. I ISN'T THAT BECAUSE OF A OF A THAT'S A G. A LOT THERE'S JUST BLOCK BECAUSE OF IT. THE KARACHI ISSUE OR THE STAINED BLOCKS ARE A THEORETICAL WE WOULD LIKE TO DRAW A THEORETICAL RADIUS AROUND A PARTICULAR SITE IN THIS ONE WAS THE- ACTIVE SEEPS AT THAT TIME- AND IT WAS WORKING WITH CAL JAM THAT SAID HEY WE WANT AND EFFECTIVE STEAM BLOCK IN THIS AREA. IT'S NOT A WALL THAT WE BUILD A REGULAR ROWNTREE YEAH UNDERSTOOD IT'S MORE REGULATORY NOT GEOLOGIC CORRECT. OKAY IT'S A THEORETICAL BUT AND WITHIN THAT YOU CAN NO LONGER- AGAIN CONDUCT THE CYCLIC STEAMING OPERATIONS AND SO THAT LIMITS YOUR ABILITIES TO AFFECT THE SUBSIDENCE  TO OFFSET THAT IN THE BACK I'M GONNA ASK I UNCLEAR AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT IT'S GAME BECAUSE I'M NOT AN ENGINEER- HOW LONG IS THIS INSTABILITY LAST I MEAN DO YOU KNOW IS THIS SOMETHING THAT'S NO MATTER WHAT AS YOU TRY TO CALL THIS FIELD ARE WE LOOKING TO TEN YEARS OF THIS TWENTY YEARS OR DO WE NOT KNOW OR ANY YEAR EVERYTHING'S FINE YOU CAN WALK AROUND THERE'S NO DANGER THERE'S NO TILTING. I MEAN HOW LONG THIS IS INSTABILITY THIS FEEL GOING TO. SELL AND BE WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MANAGE THE SUBSIDENCE AND THE UP LIVE TILL IT STOPS YOU KNOW UNTIL WE REACH SOME POINT I SAID HOW LONG DO WE KNOW HOW LONG THAT'S- GOING TO AND I DON'T KNOW THAT- I I'M NOT SURE. YOU KNOW EXACTLY- WHAT THAT TIME WOULD LOOK LIKE BUT ONCE AGAIN YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE THE COOLING PROCESS IS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME NOW- AND IS THIS WITH WHEN YOU SAY SOMETIMES SO IS THAT. A YEAR TEN YEARS MORE THAN A YEAR- BUT I DON'T KNOW PAST THAT POINT AND IS THIS KIND OF INSTABILITY COMMON WITH ALL OF THE FIELDS THAT YOU CYCLIC STEAMING. NO THIS IS VERY UNIQUE TO- THERMAL DATA MIGHT AND THERMAL DATA MY THAT IS NEAR THE SURFACE SO IF IT WERE DEEP ENOUGH DOWN THEN YOU WOULD HAVE ENOUGH OVER BURDEN OVER THE TOP OF IT THAT THIS MAY NOT BE AN ISSUE. IF IT WERE NOT DYNAMITE- ONCE AGAIN THIS MAY NOT POSE AN ISSUE IF IT WERE MORE COMPETENT ROCK AS FOR SANDSTONE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IN OTHER. SO WHAT PER. OF IT WHAT. HAVE WHAT CHEVRON. FALLS WITHIN THIS CATEGORY OF THERMAL DYNAMITE. SO BECAUSE IT THIS IS ONLY UNIQUE TO THIS. TYPE THEN WHAT PERCENT I MEAN IS THIS- THERMAL DATA MY RIGHT NOW REPRESENTS A LITTLE OVER PRODUCTION WHAT ABOUT CHEVRON'S PRODUCTION- FOR US- PRIOR TO THIS IT WAS PRIOR TO THE EVENT- WE READ ABOUT TWENTY THREE THOUSAND BARRELS- OUT OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND SO. REPORTER 20% OF PRODUCTION YEAH LESS THAN A QUARTER YEAH BORN CORD. OKAY. THE RESUME OUT THEN FOR A SECOND OKAY I KNOW YOU OVERSEE MOSTLY SAN JOAQUIN THE BUSINESS SIDE OPERATIONS I DO APPRECIATE YOUR OPENING COMMENTS THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT OF REALITY CLIMATE CHANGE. EN THAT'S A BIG FIRST STEP WITH OUR OIL MAJORS ARE IT HAS BEEN UP TO THIS POINT. BUT RECOGNIZING THAT RISK AND FOSSIL FUELS ROLE IN EXACERBATING THAT RISK. TRYING TO GET A SENSE OF WHAT. I THE CALIFORNIA SCALE COMMITMENTS ARE OR SHOULD MORE GLOBAL COMPANY WIDE COMMITMENTS ARE IN THIS AREA I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE TURN ANECDOTAL EXAMPLES RENEWABLE ENERGY WE KNOW CHEVRONS ACTUALLY VERY LARGE- ENERGY EFFICIENCY CONTRACTOR AND DOES ALL KINDS OF WORK IN THE ENERGY SPACE BUT- COULDN'T HELP BUT BE STRUCK WHEN REP SOLD THE SPANISH OIL. MAJOR ANNOUNCED THEIR COMMITMENT TO GO CARBON NEUTRAL AS AN OIL COMPANIES CHEVRON LOOKING AT THOSE KINDS OF- COMMITMENTS THEMSELVES AND- YEAH SO WE HAVE SEVERAL- CORPORATE WIDE- COMMITMENTS THAT ARE OUT THERE AND LET ME SHARE WITH YOU A COUPLE OF THEM IN AND I'LL GIVE YOU SOME EXAMPLES OF WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH IN CALIFORNIA- FIRST- WE HAVE- TARGETS FOR METHANE AND FLARING EMISSION REDUCTIONS AND THESE OR INTENSITY BASED. FOR METHANE WE PLAN TO REDUCE THAT FROM TWENTY TO TWENTY FIVE PERCENT- WHEN YOU COMPARE TWENTY SIXTEEN NUMBERS TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE SO WE ARE WELL UNDER WAY TO TRY AND ACCOMPLISH THAT FLARING WE'RE GONNA REDUCE BY TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY PERCENT- AND THE SAME COMPARISON BETWEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY THREE. ON AN UPSTREAM- SIDE OF IT WHICH MEANS YOU'RE PRODUCING ARM NOT THE REFINING SIDE- WE ALSO HAVE INTENT THE COMMITMENTS WHERE WE ARE GOING TO REDUCE THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ALL PRODUCTION BY FIVE TO TEN PERCENT- AND ALSO BE A NATURAL GAS PORTION OF THAT- IN THE GREENHOUSE GASSES ASSOCIATED WITH WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE THAT DENSITY BY. FIVE PERCENT. AND AGAIN IT IS COMPARING TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN NUMBERS TO TWENTY TWENTY THREE NUMBERS COOPERATE VERY CURIOUS ABOUT THIS AND THAT IT WAS APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND IT WILL AFFECT COMPENSATE FOR THE IMPORT BY THE IF THOSE- GOALS ARE MET OR NOT MET. AND DO YOU ACTUALLY IN A GREAT A PRICE ON CARBON INTO YOUR INTERNAL MATERIAL RISK METRICS- WE DO- AGAIN EVERY BUSINESS UNIT UNDERSTANDS WHAT THE- COST OF CARBON- WILL BE- ESPECIALLY IF THERE'S CAP AND TRADE IN PLACE- AND THAT IS FIGURE IN TO- BUSINESS PLANS AS WE PLANNED FOR FUTURE WORK AND BUDGET YOU HAVE A NUMBER DO YOU HAVE A- COMPANY WIDE NUMBER THAT YOU ASSUME FOR PASTA. WHEN YOU'RE DOING THAT ANALYSIS. ARIES BUT BY REGION OTHERS REGION BY A- YEAH SO I I'D CHAIRED I TO SHARE WITH YOU AS WELL SO THE THINGS WERE WITH CAL. A TWENTY NINETEEN WE FORM A JOY VENTURE CALLED BY GAS THIS IS WHERE WE TAKE- DIE JESTERS TO DERRY FORMS- THOSE DI DI JESTERS COME ONLINE TO DIGEST THE MEN WHO WERE AND PRODUCE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND THEN THAT NATURAL GAS IS SHARED IN TO THE- EXISTING NATURAL GAS PIPELINE INFRASTRUCTURE- SO THAT IT CAN DISPLACE- YOU KNOW THE TRADITIONAL NATURAL GAS- GOING TO A DIFFERENT SOURCES. LIKEWISE WE ALSO HAVE AT OUR LOSS HEELS- FIELD A SOLO PROJECT THAT'S GOING TO COME ONLINE- HERE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THIS YEAR- AND THIS IS GOING TO PRODUCE- ELECTRICITY THAT IS GOING TO POWER THAT LAW SEALS- FIELD FOR US- AND WE BELIEVE OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS THAT IT'S PROJECTED THAT IT'S GOING TO ELIMINATE- ONE MILLION METRIC TONS OF- OF EMISSIONS OF. CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS. I GUESS THAT THE HIGH. THE HIGHEST LEVEL THOUGH FOR. UNDER THE OLD EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH STILL IN PLACE I'M NOT SAYING IT'S SUFFICIENT. I HAVE FRANKLY THING MORE NEEDS TO BE DONE BUT- DO YOU THINK CHEVRON CAN MEET- THE CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE WELL WITHIN ITS OPERATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. I THINK THAT THAT IS A CHALLENGING TASK FORCE I WANT TO SAY THAT WE CAN'T I'M SAYING THAT THE PATH ON EXACTLY HOW WE WOULD ARRIVE THERE IS NOT A PARENT IF WE OPEN THE APERTURE AND WE SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO DO SOMETHING MORE ON A GLOBAL BASIS AND NOT JUST WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES. OF CALIFORNIA THAT OPENS UP MANY MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO ACHIEVE SOMETHING LIKE THAT. SO THE LAST QUESTION IS REALLY ABOUT. YOUR YOUR OUR OIL MAJOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT. AB T. R. C. IS THE ONLY YOU KNOW CLOSE WE'RE THE ONLY INTEGRATED I BELIEVE THAT'S IT TRYING TO GET THERE THAT'S IT. AND SO. WE NEED TO PUT MORE PRESSURE AN ONUS I BELIEVE ON YOU TO STEP UP AND DO THINGS THAT ARE TRULY INNOVATIVE- AND RECOGNIZE ANY OF OPERATIONS ALL OVER THE WORLD. YEAH THAT THIS TURNING THE PAGE THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR FROM CAL JAM I THINK WE ALSO WANT TO SEE WHAT THOSE GOOD FAITH EFFORTS ARE FROM CHEVRON AS WELL- AND I APPRECIATE SOME OF THE SOME OF THE ISSUES IMAGINE BUT I WILL SAY I'M I'M SOMEWHAT TROUBLED BY WHAT YOU'RE FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP IN TERMS OF CHALLENGING PENALTY AMOUNTS AND THEIR STAND THERE'S-A LAWYER WITH THE TECHNICAL BASIS IS WORRIED ABOUT IT- BUT WHEN THE PUBLIC HEARS THAT YOU'RE CHALLENGING A- BILL TWO POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLAR PENALTY FOR THIS ISSUE. THEY SAY WELL YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF REVENUE WHY CHALLENGE HERE. LIKEWISE THIS WEEKEND IN THE LA TIMES. I HAVE TO BRING IT UP AND I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S WITHIN YOUR PURVIEW BUT- THIS OVERALL SORT OF RELATIONSHIP WITH THE NGO COMMUNITY AND WITH ADVOCATES- ANSWER WHAT KIND A CONVERSATION WE WANT TO HAVE ABOUT. OUR KIND OF FUTURE HERE WITH YOU IN CALIFORNIA. TROUBLED TO LEARN ABOUT THE SUBPOENA PROCESS THAT'S UNDER WAY AGAINST ONE OF THESE NGOS CONSUMER WATCHDOG- AND SO WHAT WE DON'T. WE DON'T WANT TO SEE IS THE- IT WE WANT TO COOPERATIVE SPIRIT AND SOMEWHAT SO. THE CHALLENGING A PENALTY OR THE SUBPOENAING OF A OF AN NGOAGAIN I'M SURE THERE ARE PLENTY OF LAWYERS AND HOUSE HAVE MANY FOLKS YOU HIRE OUTSIDE OF YOUR YOUR HOUSE WHO HAVE PLENTY OF GOOD LEGAL REASONS TO DO WHAT THEY'RE TRYING TO DO. BUT FROM THE PUBLIC PERSPECTIVE. IT IT IT IT STRIKES ONE AS EITHER TURN OVERWHELMING AGENCY THAT'S ALREADY UNDERSTAFFED OR IN THIS NGO CASES ARE THE BIG GUY BEATING UP ON THE LITTLE GUY. IN YOU COMMENT AT ALL ON THE SUBPOENA REQUEST UNDER WAY AND IF YOU EVER ON STILL COMMITTED TO FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT. THAT KIND OF PRACTICE IN IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF HOW IT INTERACTS WITH THE NGO COMMUNITY JERRY STERN I HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE ON THE SUBPOENA THAT SO- AGAIN I'M JUST- NOT NOT AWARE OF IT SO I COULD NOT COMMENT ONE WAY OR ANOTHER. IF YOU DON'T MIND TAKING THAT BACK TO HEADQUARTERS- THAT SOMEONE WE LOVE. SOME KIND OF RESPONSE ON- WE KNOW THE NEWSPAPERS ARE GONNA BE ASKING TOO. BUT WE WANT TO KNOW HOW FAR YOU GUYS WANT TO GO WITH THIS. BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE RECOGNIZE THAT. GOT A FIGHT SOMETIMES THE COURTROOM. BUT IF WE REALLY ARE GOING TO TURN THE PAGE HERE- I AM CONCERNED THAT. WE CAN SAY ONE THING ABOUT SUSTAINABILITY. AND THEN GO. PEOPLE UP ON THE SIDELINES WHEN. NO ONE'S WATCHING NOW NOW FOLKS ARE WATCHING SO- ANYHOW- LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR FEEDBACK ON THAT POINT. AND IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO GIVE A ACTUAL TECHNICAL RESPONSE ON THE CARBON NEUTRALITY QUESTION I THINK THAT WOULD BE. ILLUMINATING FOR US FOR THESE COMMITTEES BECAUSE- YOU HAVE A LOT OF IN HOUSE KNOWLEDGE I MEAN NO ONE PROBABLY UNDERSTANDS. ENERGY AS WELL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS YOUR COMPANY SO WE CAN FIND A NATIONAL LAB REPORT OR TRY A TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO. YOU KNOW. GET CAL JIM GOING INTO THEIR ANALYSIS BUT THEY'RE TRYING TO WALK AND CHEW GUM AND PERMIT OR NOT PERMIT OR ANALYZE IT ALL THE SAME TIME SO. TO EXTEND YOUR FOLKS CAN START TO DO SOME THAT TECHNICAL ANNOUNCE I THINK YOU REALLY HEALTHY FRANKLY FOR HAVING AN HONEST ENERGY CONVERSATION AND- LIKE I SAID I KNOW WE'RE IN ALL STATE- BUT HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING INNOVATIVE HERE. THAT'S NOT GONNA FEEL LIKE BUSINESS AS USUAL I COULDN'T AGREE MORE WE WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING TOGETHER ON THIS ALL RIGHT- WHAT YOU'VE BEEN WAY TOO PATIENT- CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF STUFF THAT'S BEEN GOING ON IN. YOUR DISTRICT OVER THE YEARS IN YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ASSEMBLY MEMBER. YEAH THANK YOU KNOW AND I APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONING I THINK THAT WERE ALL AT LEAST THOSE OF US LEFT ON THE DíAS ARE. ALIGNING AND THINKING THE SAME SO YOU ASK SOME QUESTIONS BUT I DO HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS AND I START WITH THE ADMINISTRATION- YOU HAVE MEANT IN A COUPLE TIMES THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING BUT IT. REQUESTED THAT YOU CAN HIRE- ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS BUT ASIDE FROM HIRING MORE ENFORCEMENT OFF. WERE OTHER DREADED. I IS YOU KNOW ARE WE AS A STATE NOW IMPLEMENTING ARE LOOKING AT- TO INCREASE ENFORCEMENT AND OVERSIGHT. YEAH I THINK THE BUT IS IT IS A BIG OF THAT NOW HAVE RECENTLY CREATED A AND ENFORCEMENT UNIT- THAT'S A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION THAT HAS ENGINEERS AND ATTORNEYS WORKING TOGETHER- AND THAT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS. WE HAVE- AND CAN DO SOME ADDITIONAL VALUATION O LOOK AT A POTENTIAL LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS- LOOK IT ADDITIONAL% WAYS TO- INCREASE OUR FORCE MEANT WE RECENTLY MET WITH US FOR AND TALKED ABOUT THE WAY THEY DO ENFORCEMENT IS DIFFERENT THAN HOW WE DO ENFORCEMENT THERE'S OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CHANGE OUR- PENALTY CALCULATIONS- THAT WILL STAND UP UNDER A- LEGAL REVIEW IN AND DURABILITY- SO THAT WAS A CONVERSATION WE RECENTLY HAD. A IN THE LAST MONTH- BUT THERE'S A THERE'S A NUMBER WHAT THINGS WE CAN STILL DO- FOREIGN FORCE MEN AND THINKING ABOUT- IT WHAT'S THE BEST WAY TO GET THERE IS IT IS IT BIG PENALTIES IS THAT- BOND TEAM IS IT SOMETHING ELSE OF THEIR THEIR I THINK A LARGER CONVERSATION COULD BE HAD ABOUT THAT- WE COULD DO SOME RESEARCH ABOUT THIS- BY DIFFERENT INSURANCE AGENCY TO SEE WHAT IS OUR SKIN WITH THE BEST WITH THE MANAGER- IN ITS- NEW. RISK MITIGATION TOOLS I MEAN WE COULD I THINK THE IDYLLWILD PROGRAM. THERE WERE MORE WELL ABANDONED AS WE ISSUE OVER EIGHT. PER AND TWENTY. AND THEY WERE. WELL A BAND PERMITS AND REALLY PER. AND PART OF THAT- IS THE OF MOVING TO TAKE CARE OF A LEGACY INFRASTRUCTURE. BUT WE'RE ALSO THE VITAL WELL FEES WE'RE BUILDING UP FOR A RESERVE TO BE ABLE TO START. A BAND IN WORKING TOWARDS SOME THE LIABILITY BUT- HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WHILE PEOPLE IN OPERATIONS THAT THEY ARE. MAKING TO TAKING CARE OF THEIR THEIR ASSETS AND NOT LEAVE A TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK SO THERE SOME SOME THINGS WE CAN DO INTERNALLY BUT THE BIGGER- ITEMS THAT STILL ARE UNADDRESSED BY A RECENT REPORT. YOU KNOW THAT HAS LIABILITY BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED MILLION TO NINE BILLION- THAT'S OUT THERE AND THERE IS THERE SOMETHING THAT. YOU KNOW LEASE WE HAVE A POINT. YOU KNOW OF SOME SCENARIOS LOOK AT BUT NOW THE NEXT STEP IS WHAT WE DO TO MITIGATE THOSE RISKS. AND I'M GLAD THAT THAT'S BEING LOOKED AT. YOU KNOW IN PART BECAUSE THEY- OF THE FACT THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF ONE IDLE WHILE- AND THERE ARE OVER THIRTY THOUSAND THAT HAVE NOT. BEEN USED IN FIFTEEN YEARS OR MORE IN THE STATE. I AND THIS IS ONE AND THIS ONE HAS CAUSED FOR A LOT OF GREAT DISCUSSION AND SO- WHEN I HEAR- THAT IT'S COSTS TO IT. SO FAR NINE POINT TWO MILLION- SO TO CLEAN UP- DO WONDER WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. WE NOW ONE MORE THAN ON- GOES- YOU KNOW IT CAUSES THIS LEVEL OF PROBLEM AND THE- COMPANY DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO EVERYTHING THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE- AND THEN YOU HAVE THE ORPHAN WELLS. RIGHT TO HAVE IDLE AND ORPHANED SO A THINK THAT THERE'S A LOT FOR US TO THINK ABOUT. AND I AM GLAD TO HEAR. THAT THERE'S DIFFERENT- APPROACH IS BEING CONSIDERED- IN TERMS OF WHAT E CAN DO TO ENSURE THAT THE TAXPAYERS ON THE HOOK FOR THIS. SO IT IT STRETCHING OVER I'M A JUST WANT TO ASK. MISTER LIKE COULD BE IF YOU CAN JUST- TALK YOU MENTION A COST NINE POINT TWO MILLION TO CLEAN UP THAT'S- AND THAT THIS WAS BILL WAS OVER ONE ACRE pOF THAT TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND ACRES AND THAT YOU HAVE AND FROM YOUR PERSPECTIVE BUT WHAT A CHEVRON AND DOING DIFFERENTLY NOW TO THINK ABOUT THIS THAT IS A LOT OF MONEY TO CLEAN UP ONE ACRE WHEN YOU HAVE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND. AND THIS IS ONE IDYLLWILD WHAT'S BEEN DONE DIFFERENTLY SO FIRST AND FOREMOST IS TO PREVENT THIS FROM EVER HAPPENING AGAIN THAT THAT'S THE- PRIMARY OBJECTIVE THERE AND SO WHAT WE DOING TO DRIVE THAT WE ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH REGARDS TO THE REVIEWS THAT WE'RE DOING ON ALL OF OUR WELLS- WE HAVE NOW REVIEWED- ELEVEN. ELEVEN HUNDRED- IDA WELLS INCLUDING SOME THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED ALREADY AND OUR STUDY IN THOSE VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS- NO CHANCE FOR A NOTHER LEAGUE PATH TO GET TO THE SURFACE OF THE OF THIS ANALYSIS- WE ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH REGARDS TO THE- MONITORING OF THE FIELD I DESCRIBED TO YOU BEFORE ON THE GROUND- MOVEMENT MONITORING. PROGRAMS THAT WE HAVE- WE ARE CONTINUING TO TIGHTEN UP THE FREQUENCY AT WHICH WE DO THAT THE EVALUATION TIME- HOW WE PROCESS THE DATA SO THAT WE ARE MORE RESPONSIVE ON UNDERSTANDING EXACTLY WHAT'S GOING ON AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MONITOR EXACTLY WHEN WE CAN. AT A L. IT'S IN TECH SO THAT ONCE AGAIN WE CAN A IN AND IT A BAN THAT RIGHT AWAY SO DOES NOT BECOME A LEAGUE. AND OR LEAD TO A SEAT. OKAY THANK YOU AND- THE YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S BEEN RECOGNIZED. BY MY COLLEAGUES THAT- ONE OF THE REASON THAT WE'RE HERE IN PART IS BECAUSE THIS IS CHEVRON AND YOU'RE ONE OF THE BIGGEST- COMPANIES HERE IN OUR STATE- BUT IT ALSO MEANS THAT YOU HAVE A CAPACITY TO DO SOME THINGS THAT. OTHER COMPANIES DON'T HAVE- THE CAPACITY TO DO SO WHEN WE HEAR THAT- THAT EVEN A COMPANY AS BIG AS YOU THAT HAS I MEAN PERSON NOW THE HAS TECHNOLOGY ADVANCED STUDIES AND RESEARCH- YOU HAVE THE A BIT. EVEN YOUR STRUGGLING TO KEEP UP WITH- ONE WELL THAT YOU KNOW HAS LEAKED. HOW I MEAN HOW DO WE ALIGN THAT WITH WITH THE IDEA THAT WE I MEAN WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS- YOU'RE A BIG COMPANY YOU CAN DO IT SOME WOULD SAY THAT IF CHEVRON CAN'T DO IT THEN THAT MEANS WE REALLY SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT EVERYBODY ELSE AS WELL. I MEAN. HOW DO WE THINK ABOUT THAT HOW DO YOU HOW CAN YOU HELP US THINK ABOUT THIS THIS ISSUE THAT WE'RE GRAPPLING WITH. WE CAN OPERATE THIS SAFELY WE HAVE BEEN DOING SO FOR MANY YEARS AND WE CAN DO SO FOR MANY YEARS TO COME IT'S A MATTER OF ONCE AGAIN- STAYING- CONSISTENT WITH- SOLID- PRACTICES TAKEN LESSONS LEARNED FROM. EVENTS LIKE WHAT WE JUST HAD AN IMPROVING WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO GOING FORWARD IN THE FUTURE. SO I WOULD SAY THAT YOU JUST HAVE TO STAY CONSISTENT WITH THAT PIECE OF IT AND ONCE AGAIN- MITIGATE- THOSE THINGS OUT THERE THAT CAN LEAD TO POSSIBILITIES- OF SEEPS- AND OUR OTHER- FAILURES. SO WHEN WE- ARE LOOKING AT PARTICULAR AT THIS PARTICULAR SITUATION- THERE WAS. A IN ANNOUNCEMENT ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS THAT THE RELEASE WAS STOPPED- ONLY TO SEE IT RESTART- OVER AND THAT. WE START TO. KIND OF LOSE CONFIDENCE AND SO WHAT WHAT WHAT IS HAPPENING FROM. YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE IS HAPPENING TO ENSURE THAT IT WHEN WE GET AN ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT STOPPED THE RELEASE A STOP TO- THAT WE DON'T SEE IT- CONTINUE. TO RESTORE OVER AND OVER SURE NO THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND- WHAT YOU WERE SEEING AT THAT PARTICULAR POINT WAS THE- AT THAT POINT WE WERE NOT AT EQUILIBRIUM IN THAT WE WERE NOT ABLE TO MANAGE THE SUBSIDENCE BECAUSE WE HAD A STEAM BLOCK THAT WAS IN PLACE. SO I STILL HAVE MY SAME CONDITIONS DOWN HOLE I DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY TO MANAGE MY SUBSIDENCE- BUT BECAUSE OF THE STEAM BLOCK THAT'S THERE I CAN'T INJECT ANYTHING INTO IT- AND SO THERE'S A LONG PERIOD OF TIME THAT GOES WHERE YOU'RE STILL CONTINUE AND SEE THE SUBSIDENCE. AND YOU CAN IMAGINE SQUEEZING A BALLOON OR THROUGH THE TOOTHPASTE- YOU'RE SINKING DOWN RIGHT HERE YOU'RE MOVING- FLUIDS- TO THE OUTSIDES OF IT WHICH LED TO ADDITIONAL SEEPS SITES. AND THAT'S WHAT WE WERE DEALING WITH- WAY SOON AS WE HAD THE ABILITY TO START INTRODUCING WATER AS OPPOSED TO STEAM- WHERE THE WHERE WE WERE ABLE TO START REPLACING THAT WE WERE ABLE TO MANAGE THE SUBSIDENCE- AND ONCE AGAIN WE SAW MORE EQUILIBRIUM TAKE PLACE AND THAT THESE ADDITIONAL SEEPS SITES STOPPED. TO THE POINT THAT RIGHT NOW WE ONLY HAVE ONE THAT IS ACTIVE AND THE ONE Y. HAS NOT HAD ANY SLEEP SITES FOR SOME MONTHS NOW. OKAY THANK YOU AT A YOU KNOW OVERALL I THINK THAT THIS IS BEEN. VERY INFORMATIONAL AND I AND I DO HOPE THAT WE- CONTINUE TO ASK THESE QUESTIONS I FEEL LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE- THE MAGNITUDE OF THE NUMBER OF IDLE AND OR PHÃN. WELLS IS SO GREAT THAT I JUST KEEP THINKING WHAT HAPPENS IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE- WELLS THAT REQUIRED THIS MUCH INTENSITY THAT RIGHT BACK. YOU KNOW RELEASE AT SERVICE EXPRESS TO THE EXTENT THAT THEY- I DO KNOW WHY WE GO THE RE AND HAPPENS PARTICULARLY WITH THE- USERS OF DIFFERENT SIZES- THIS IS CHEVRON BUT THERE ARE OTHER PRODUCERS DIFFERENT SIZES WITH DIFFERENT- CAPACITIES I HAD TO DO PERHAPS NOT IDEAL OR NOT NOT THE SAME- BUT A DIFFERENT AMOUNT. OF YOU KNOW OF INTERVENTION TO TRY TO. REMEDY THE PROBLEM- SO I HOPE THAT WE'RE WE'RE THINKING ABOUT THAT- I A DEFINITELY IT'S- A BIG CONCERN FOR ME- THAT HAS- THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUES AND- I AM. YOU KNOW HAPPY TO HEAR THAT WERE ALSO- GOING TO BE THINKING ABOUT. ON AND YOU KNOW- IMPACT ON THE COMMUNITIES AND- I THINK I'VE HEARD BY BOTH THE ADMINISTRATION AND- CHEVRON TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF SCIENCE SCIENCE AND DATA AND I HOPE THAT WE ACCEPT THE SCIENCE AND DATA- OF ALLYOU KNOW ALL THAT IS OUT THERE I THINK THE C. C. S. T. SUMMARY IS. PRETTY DATA AND RICH- AND THAT TELLS A LOT OF WHAT'S LEFT TO DO SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU SEVEN MEMBER UNLESS THERE'S ANY FURTHER COMMENTS. WE APPRECIATE YOU ALL COMING TO TESTIFY WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO OUR FINAL PANEL BEFORE TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT. SHE HAD IT THANK YOU- SO NEXT WE'RE GOING TO CALL UP. MISS CATHERINE RIOS BOARD WITH THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATIONAS WELL AS INGRID BROS FROM WHO I BELIEVE IS WITH THE CENTER FOR- THE COMMITTED OUT THERE. YEAH SO. ASK YOU FOR SOME OPENING COMMENTS AND I'M SURE WE'LL HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR YOU I DO APPRECIATE IT- MYSTERIES BUT ONCE YOU START THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES. JERRY STERN CHAIR FRIEDMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT REMAIN WITH US. OUR CATTERY AS BOYD PRESIDENT OF THE WESTERN STATES PETROLEUM ASSOCIATION ON IS WHAT'S BY. I'M SPEAKING TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE MEN AND WOMEN IN OUR INDUSTRY WHO SERVE THE COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. WHERE THE OLD STRAIGHT ASSOCIATION IN THE UNITED STATES AND WE REPRESENT BOTH OIL PRODUCERS AND REFINERS ON THE WEST COAST- AND WE- WORK TO ENSURE A RELIABLE. ACCESS TO PATROLMAN PETROLEUM PRODUCTS THROUGH POLICIES THAT ARE SOCIALLY ENVIRONMENTALLY AND ECONOMICALLY RESPONSIBLE. WE THINK IT'S REALLY ANSWER ESSENTIAL THAT THE ABUNDANT SUPPLIES OF AFFORDABLE PETROLEUM BASED TRANSPORTATION FUELS AND OTHER VITAL PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WHICH WE ALL ENJOY WOULD BE SITTING HERE WITHOUT THEM THAT THEY REMAIN AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC AS WE CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS AND I'LL GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF THE DETAILS AS TO WHAT. THE LIVELIHOODS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE AND THE ECONOMIC WELL BEINGS OF MILLIONS MORE REALLY DEPEND ON A VIABLE AND GAS INDUSTRY IN THE STATE. FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE AS WE- GO FORWARD WHERE STATE LEADERS AND UTILITY PROVIDERS AT TIMES WRESTLE WITH POWER IN SECURITIES OIL AND NATURAL GAS REMAIN A FOUNDATION ENERGY RESOURCE FOR THE STATE. THAT WE CAN RELY ON WHEN THE ELECTRICITY GRID GOES BACK DARK AND AIDS AND OBVIOUSLY EMERGENCY AND VITAL SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIA. WE RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF COLLABORATION. AND WE STRIVE TO MEET THE A BIT BUT VICIOUS GOALS OF THE STATE. I WANT TO POINT TO A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF THAT ONE BEING SB THREE NINETY EIGHT OBVIOUSLY THE CAPITA RATE PROGRAM WHICH WE SUPPORTED.ITS COMPANION BILL SB SIX SEVENTEEN WHICH I THINK IS ONE OF THE MOST REMARKABLE THINGS THAT THE STATE OF DONE TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES. AS BEFORE WHICH IS OF COURSE THE WELL STIMULATION- REGULATION SB EIGHTY THREE WHICH IS THE U. I. C. REGULATION SB EIGHTY THREE ALL BLOG TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT THAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW. AND I'VE BEEN HONORED AND APPOINTED BY THE STATE TO SERVE ON MANY OF THESE BROAD AND DIVERSE STAKEHOLDER GROUPS THAT WORK TOGETHER TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROGRAMS THAT INCLUDES. SB EIGHTY THREE AND A. B. SIX SEVENTEEN. AND WE'RE WORKING WITH THE RESOURCES AGENCY AND CAL JAM ON NOT ONLY ALL THE AYE ITEMS IDENTIFIED IN THE PRESS RELEASE BUT ALSO MANY OF THE OTHER EFFORTS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT. ALSO IF YOU SIZE IN THEM IN A MOMENT BUT THERE IS REALLY NOTHING MORE IMPORTANT TO US I THINK AS YOU'VE HEARD IS THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THE COMMUNITIES WHERE THE WOMEN AND MEN OF OUR INDUSTRY WORK. AND LIVE AND RAISE THEIR FAMILIES SO WE'RE PROUD TO BE GOOD NEIGHBORS WERE PROUD TO SUPPORT OUR STATE'S ENERGY INDEPENDENCE. AND WE PRODUCE PROBABLY THE MOST CLEANEST. OF AFFORDABLE ENERGY. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND YOU ARE ALL LEADERS IN MAKING THAT HAPPEN. CALIFORNIA'S ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS DO LEAD THE WORLD AND THE FURTHER STUDY OF WHAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY BEST SCIENCE REAL DATA ABOUT PRODUCTION PRACTICES IN OUR STATE WILL REALLY ONLY RECONFIRM THIS LEADERSHIP THAT YOU ALL HAVE AND WE'LL HAVE YOU HEARD SECRETARY CROWFOOT MENTION THE IMPORTANCE OF REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. SCIENCE HEALTH AND SAFETY AN ECONOMY WE SUPPORT THOSE GOALS AS WELL. BUT WE CAN'T IGNORE THE FRAME WORK WHICH WE ALL LIVE IN I KNOW YOU DON'T IGNORE THE FRAMEWORK IN WHICH WE ALL LIVE SO WHY WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON ALL THESE PERMANENT IMPROVEMENTS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT TODAY. ONE IN SIX CALIFORNIAS STILL STRUGGLE TO AFFORD NECESSITIES. THE AVERAGE FAMILY TO WORKING PARENTS SPENT AND UTILITIES THE AVERAGE TWO BEDROOM IS 55% HIGHER IN CALIFORNIA THAN THE NATION AND ENERGY COSTS ARE A MAJOR FACTOR OF THAT. SO AT THE SAME TIME- THE OIL INDUSTRY IS IN A POSITION. IN A AND FRANKLY A DIRE POSITION BECAUSE THE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AROUND ISSUING PERMITS OF COURSE THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THROUGH THESE PROGRAMS. AND THESE POLICY CHANGES AND THE OIL INDUSTRY'S.REACTION TO THEM AND THE DELAYS IN SACRAMENTO DO LEAD TO REAL LIFE IN PACKS AFFORDABILITY LOST JOBS. LOCAL TAX BENEFITS ENDING. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT WE PRODUCE IN THE TOUGHEST REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING LABOR HEALTH SAFETY STANDARDS IN THE WORLD IN CALIFORNIA BARNUM. SO EFFORTS TO LIMIT ELIMINATE OR DRAMATICALLY KERR PRODUCTION. DOES NOTHING TO ELIMINATE DEMAND. AND ONLY HURTS OUR EFFORTS TO ADDRESS GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE AND DECREASES OUR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE BY ENCOURAGING MORE IMPORTS FROM AREAS WITH LESS STRINGENT ENVIRONMENTAL RAKES. SO JUST PUT UP ONE QUICK SLIDE HERE. SO THE ENERGY DEMANDS OF THE WORLD'S FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY AS YOU ALL KNOW CONTINUE TO GROW WE ARE THE THIRD LARGEST CONSUMER OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS ON THE PLANET. AS A STATE. WITH ONLY CHINA AND THE U. S. IN FRONT OF US NINETY PART 6% OF ALL TRANSPORTATION FUELS IN THE STATE COMES FROM PATROLLING. I ONLY KNOW THAT BECAUSE THIS IS THE CONTEXT IN WHICH WERE HAVING THE CONVERSATION OF WHERE WE GO IN THE FUTURE. FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. SOON TO BE FIFTEEN PEOPLE NOT TO NEARLY FOR FUTURE DRIVE THIRTY MILLION VEHICLES. EVERY DAY. NOW IT'S GREAT WE HAVE ALMOST SEVEN HER THOUSAND LECTURED VEHICLES WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO ELECTRIC VEHICLES FAILED GET INTO DETAILS ON OUR COMPANIES INVESTING AND- MANY ELEMENTS OF THEM. AND WE HAVE AGGRESSIVE GOALS OF FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY TWENTY THIRTY. BUT FIVE MILLION LIKE TRICKLES WE HAVE THIRTY MILLION TURNER PROFESSION ENGINES IT'S A BIT OF A GAP IT'S GOING TO TAKE AWHILE. SO ONE THING WELL KNOWN I SAY THIS OFTEN IS EVERYDAY. WE'LL WAKE UP HOPEFULLY. WE EXPECT THREE THINGS WE TURN OUR LIGHTS ON WE HEAT AND COOL OUR HOMES AND WE DRIVE FROM A TO B. THAT'S EVERYDAY THAT'S A BIG TASK. WHILE WE'RE TRYING TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THESE AGGRESSIVE GOALS. AND HOW THE STATE GOES ABOUT THAT IS SUPER IMPORTANT I DON'T NEED TO TELL YOU THAT. BUT GOVERNOR NEWSOME STATED ALSO AND I THINK YOU HEARD FROM SECRETARY CROWFOOT. THE TRANSITION CANNOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT IT MUST ADVANCE IN A DELIBERATE WAY. TO PROTECT PEOPLE ARE VARMINT AND OUR ECONOMY. SO THE THIRD ONE IS WE CONSUME DAILY JUST PUT IN A CONTEXT AGAIN FORTY TWO MILLION GALLONS OF GASOLINE EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION GALLONS OF DIESEL. CORD WITH JET FUEL- AND CALIFORNIA DRIVE THREE HUNDRED BILLION MILES HERE. AND THAT TO TWENTY SEVENTEEN WAS OUR HIGHEST LEVEL CONSUMPTION BUT HISTORICALLY CONSUMPTION INCREASES WITH IMPROVED ECONOMY. I'LL GET INTO A LITTLE BIT OF. WEEK WEEK AS CALIFORNIANS CONSUME ALL THE OIL WE PRODUCE IN THE STATE SALADA GALLONS A DAY PROCESS BY CALIFORNIA REFINERS SO WE CONSUME EVERY BIT OF IT. BUT IT'S ONLY 30% OF WHAT WE MAKE. AND WE KNOW AND YOU'VE HEARD 70% OF IT COMES FROM. OTHER PLACES TO MEET OUR ENERGY TO MASS NOW I'D LIKE TO FLIP THOSE NUMBERS. I'D REALLY LIKE TO PRODUCE 70% HERE AND REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON OIL ON FOREIGN ORAL. SO BUT THIS IS THE NUMBERS WE HAVE TODAY. SO TO YOUR POINT YOUR QUESTION EARLIER WHERE DO THESE SOURCES OF CRUDE OIL COME FROM THERE'S A CHART SO THESE FOREIGN COUNTRIES SAUDI ARABIA ECUADOR COLOMBIA A ROCK. AS YOU ALL KNOW THAT DON'T POLITE THEY DON'T APPLY CALIFORNIA SAFETY HUMAN RIGHTS LABOR ENVIRONMENT RAKES. WE HEARD EARLIER WE ARE PART OF THE BIGGER PICTURE AND THIS DOES NEED TO BE PART OF THAT CONVERSATION AS WE GO FORWARD. HERE'S JUST SOME OF THE IMPACTS ON WHAT IS THE WHAT ANY KIND OF STATEWIDE BAN WOULD DO. AND IT REALLY HAPPENS WHETHER IT'S BàN OR NOT BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT ISSUED PERMITS IT REALLY ACTS AS A BAND. SO IT WOULD BE A LOSS OF ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION TAX REVENUES TO SCHOOLS PUBLIC SAFETY LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AS YOU HEARD FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND. JOBS NOT JUST JOBS CAREERS. THESE ARE THESE ARE HIGH PAYING CAREER JOBS THAT YOU HAVE YOU HEARD PREVIOUSLY. AND THERE DIVERSE CAREERS FROM ALL SPECTRUMS INCLUDING THOSE WITH HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATIONS ALL THE WAY UP. TO OBVIOUSLY MASTER'S PROGRAMS WITH BENEFITS RETIREMENT PLANS THAT NOT ONLY ARE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN OUR INDUSTRY BUT ALSO FOR. THEIR FUTURE OF THEIR CHILDREN. I'M HAPPY AS PROVIDE TO THE COMMITEE A REPORT CAPITAL MATRIX JUST COMPLETED EXCUSE ME. IT'S LIKE. AND WE CAN GIVE YOU THIS REPORT IT'S THE IMPACT OF STATEWIDE OIL PRODUCTION BAN ON DOWNSTREAM PATROL PETROLEUM MARKETS AND IT ESTIMATED- DEPENDING ON THE TIME PERIOD WE'R TALKING ABOUT INCREASED GAS PRICES FROM SIXTY CENTS TO TWO DOLLARS AND THIRTY THREE CENTS A GALLON. SO PROPONENTS OF BANDS WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA SOURCES AND I WANT TO NOTE THAT EVEN. THAT ENVIRONMENTALLY COSTLY APPROACH IF WE WERE TO DO IT WOULD NOT WORK. SORRY THE REASON BEING THAT OUR STATE IS AN ENERGY ISLAND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE NO PIPELINES TO BRING CRUDE OIL INTO THE STATE SO IT ALL COMES IN BY MARIN TANKER. WE DON'T HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IMPORT CAPACITY TO EVEN BEGIN TO IMPORT A 100% OF OUR ENERGY AS WE HAVE THIS CONVERSATION. SO SINCE THE BAN WON'T REDUCE CALIFORNIA'S DEMAND FOR ENERGY WITHOUT A MASSIVE INCREASE IN IMPORT INFRASTRUCTURE IT WOULD LIMIT COMMUTE. CONSUMER ACCESS TO FUEL AND IT REALLY RESULT IN HIGHER ENERGY COSTS. WHEN WE LOOK AT WHERE WE ARE TODAY HERE'S YOUR TYPICAL GAS PUMP. BEEN IN NO WAY ARE WE SUGGESTING THAT THESE PROGRAMS AREN'T MERITORIOUS. I'M ONLY SUGGESTING THEY HAVE COST AND AFFORDABILITY IMPACTS ON CONSUMERS. CERTAINLY THE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM YOU'RE SEEING THESE ARE TRACKED BY THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION- IS EIGHTEEN POINT FOUR CENTS A GALLON YOU SEE LOW CARBON FUEL CENTER CREEPING UP OVER TIME. AT EIGHTEEN POINT THREE CENT OF COURSE THE HIGHEST- STATE TAXES ON THE TOP AND FEDERAL TAXES AND THEN OTHER- OTHER STATE AND LOCAL SALES TAXES AND THEN THE UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANK BECAUSE SO BEFORE WE EVEN. GET ANY CRUDE OIL AND FIGURE OUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO WITH IT TO MAKE IT INTO A VALUABLE PRODUCT. WHERE THE BUCK EIGHT. SO THAT TELLS YOU. JUST SOMETHING TO THINK ABOUT AS WE GO FORWARD IN THESE PROGRAMS FROM AFFORDABILITY STANDPOINT. THERE ARE. IMPLICATIONS TO CONSUMERS FROM THAT AND WE JUST NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. SO IN CLOSING- I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT WE REMAIN COMMITTED TO THE PROGRESS THAT COMES WITH COLLABORATION INNOVATION AND I'VE BEEN DOING THIS THIRTY SIX YEARS NOW. I HAVE BEEN AROUND SINCE NINETEEN OH SEVEN WHEN WE STARTED BUT I'VE BEEN DOING IT THIRTY SIX YEARS- AND I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU THE IS THE MOST INNOVATIVE. AMAZING CREATIVE PEOPLE I HAVE EVER HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF WORKING FOR. IT'S A VERY EXCITING TIME BECAUSE THEY'RE IN AT ALL. THEY'RE IN OF COURSE MAKING TRADITIONAL CONVENTIONAL FEEL BETTER CLEANER MORE EFFICIENT EVERYDAY CLEANEST BURNING GASOLINE ON THE PLANET I WAS BACK WHEN WE REMOVE SO FRIDAY DIESEL SO BUT OUR OUR- OUR WORLD UP TRICKLING BURN CLEANER BURNING GASOLINE RANKS WITH THEIR RESOURCES BOARD. BUT THEY'RE IN AT ALL THEY'RE IN IT FOR BIO FUELS YOU HEARD IT WHEN THE SOLAR BATTERY TECHNOLOGY. AND I ALWAYS SAY IF NOT US THAN WHO. YOU CALLED ON US TO BE INNOVATIVE AND CREATIVE WE PLAN TO DO EXACTLY THAT. BECAUSE IT'S ALL OF THE ABOVE AND WERE IN AT ALL. INCLUDING WHAT WE DO EACH AND EVERY DAY TO KEEP THE STATE MOVING WHILE WE FIGURE THIS ALL OUT. AND CAN YOU IMAGINE PRODUCING CRUDE OIL AND A CARBON NEGATIVE WAY. BECAUSE WE CAN. WE CAN IMAGINE IT. WE LOOK TO PARTNER WITH THE STATE AND THINGS LIKE CCS I THINK WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS ABOUT CCS PREVIOUSLY VERY EXCITED ABOUT THIS- ON THURSDAY OF THIS WEEK LARGE LVER NATIONAL LABS WILL BE. DOING A PRESS CONFERENCE IN THE CAPITOL ON THEIR REPORT ON CC YES AND THE ABILITY OF CALIFORNIA GIVEN ITS WONDERFUL GEOLOGY TO DO THIS TECHNOLOGY. AND IF THEY WILL ALSO KNOWN IN THIS REPORT WE'VE HEARD IT BEFORE FROM THEM IN PREVIOUS REPORTS THAT WE CANNOT MEET OUR CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS EVEN WITH EVERYTHING WE ARE DOING WITHOUT CCS PERIOD. I'M GONNA DO. SO WE'RE ANXIOUS TO GET ON WITH THAT CONVERSATION WHEN I WAS FOR THE FIRST TIME A WHEN GETS TRADE ASSOCIATION WAS ABLE TO VISIT MADRID FOR COP TWENTY FIVE SO I WAS PRIVILEGED TO DO THAT. SPOKEN THREE PANELS ONE OF THEM WAS CCS AND WE WERE ABLE TO BRING THE CALIFORNIA DELEGATION TOGETHER IN MADRID WITH EXPERTS TO TALK ABOUT THAT. SO WE HAD SECRETARY CROWFOOT SECRETARY CHAIRED BLUMENFELD AND COMMISSIONER- ANDREW MCALLISTER FROM THE ENERGY COMMISSION. TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE GONNA TRY TO DO FOR CCS I JUST WANNA PUT A- CCS PLUG IN THERE BECAUSE I KNOW THE INVITATION ASKED US TO LOOK AT CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS THIS IS GOING TO BE REALLY REALLY CRITICAL. AND WHAT A GREAT THING WE CAN ALL DO TOGETHER AND WORK ON SOMETHING CONSTRUCTIVE. SO WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF BALANCING THE ENVIRONMENT THE ECONOMY. SOCIAL JUSTICE AND THE RIGHT ENERGY MIX. IT IS MY ASSERTION THAT NO POLICY CAN BE SUSTAINABLE WITHOUT ALL FOR. CAN'T HAVE ONE OR TWO OR THREE YOU NEED ALL FOUR SETS SO I LOOK AT POLICIES AND JUDGE THEM. AND YOU KNOW IN GOOD AND I HAVE HAD THE BENEFIT OF- TESTIFYING TOGETHER BEFORE AND I THINK- AT KERN COUNTY IS HEARING I GOT TO GO AFTER ANGER NOT SHE GETS GO AFTER ME SO. WORSE FOR FLIP IN. BUT EVEN AT THAT HEARING WE- THERE'S THINGS WERE NOT GOING TO BRING ON. BUT THERE'S ALSO THINGS WE ARE GOING TO VERY ON AND I THINK THOSE FOR TENANTS ARE PART OF THAT. AND THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY AND A STRONG ENVIRONMENT AND DEAL WITH OUR- SOCIAL JUSTICE ISSUES AND AGAIN SIX SEVENTEENS A WONDERFUL PROGRAM. AND THEN WHAT IS THAT ENERGY MIX REALLY LOOK LIKE AS WE AS WE GO FORWARD SO. WE STRONGLY BELIEVE EVERYONE DESERVES A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AND WE MAY NOT SIR WE MAY NOT SHARE SOMETIMES THE SAME POLITICS BUT WE DO SHARE THE SAME FUTURE. AND I STRONGLY BELIEVE THAT OUR PLANET OUR PEOPLE ARE PROSPERITY AND FRANKLY OUR PROGRESS TOWARDS A SUSTAINABLE FUTURE DEPENDS ON ALL FOUR OF THOSE. AND I APPRECIATE YOU HAVING ME A SEAT AT YOUR TABLE THANK YOU FOR. THANK YOU AND FOR THE ENDURANCE EFFORT HERE TO. THIS PRESSURE. YES THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE INVITATION TO BE HERE THIS OF COURSE IS A IMPORTANT TOPIC IN AN IMPORTANT TOPIC FOR MY ORGANIZATION WHICH IS THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY THE ENVIRONMENT A WE ARE BASED IN KERN COUNTY- AND YOU CAN'T HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OIL AND GAS WITHOUT ALSO BEING A CONVERSATION ABOUT CURRENT I WE WORK DIRECTLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES ON AND WE'RE- GETTING OUR DIRECTIVES FROM THEM- SO IT IS THE RESIDENT OF KERN COUNTY WHO LIVE IN THE MIDST OF OIL AND GAS DRILLING- WHO ARE SAYING THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM. ON THAT THESE HAVE HEALTH IMPACTS AND THIS IS WHAT OUR ORGANIZATION NEEDS TO PRIORITIZE AND THAT'S WHY I'M SITTING HERE TODAY I'M I ALSO HAVE A POWER POINT WHICH I WILL. SHARE WITH YOU SO THE- THIS IS A AT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE. ON TRANSITIONING THE WORK FORCE ENVIRONMENT AND ECONOMY. IN KERN COUNTY AND SO I DO WANT TO START WITH SAYING YES WE HAVE SHARED GOALS- ESPECIALLY WITH THE LABOR FORCE ON IN KERN COUNTY- WE WANT A THRIVING A PROSPEROUS LOCAL ECONOMY WE DO NOT WANT TO SEE KERN COUNTY DECIMATED. WE WANT GOOD WELL PAYING AND SAFE JOBS. ARE WE ALSO WANT HEALTHY PLACES TO LIVE WORK PLAY AND PRAY. WE WANT INVESTED AN INCREASE INVESTMENT IN KERN COUNTY WHICH HAS BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND SO MANY DIFFERENT AREAS I'M AND AGAIN I THINK YOU TALK TO OIL AND GAS WORKERS THEY WOULD SAY THE SAME THING SO WE ARE COMING FROM A PLACE OF SHARED GOALS- EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE PROBABLY DIFFERENT DIFFERENCE OF OPINIONS ON HOW TO.GET THERE. ARM ONE THING ONE PROMISE THAT I'D LIKE TO START WITH. ARM IS THAT AS WE FIGHT NOW TO PROTECT THE STATUS SOME SECTORS ARE FIGHTING TO PROTECT THE STATUS QUO. AND KERN COUNTY- I WOULD ARGUE AND SUBMIT THAT THE STATUS QUO IS NOT GOOD ENOUGH- KERN COUNTY IS A- FAIRLY NON DIVERSE ECONOMY IT IS. VERY DEPENDENT ON BOTH OIL AND GAS EXTRACTION ON AND CONVENTIONAL AGRICULTURE. ON THIS AS YOU KNOW DESPITE THE WEALTH OF THESE RESOURCES IN KERN COUNTY- YOU DO SEE VERY HIGH UNEMPLOYMENT RATES- EVEN THOUGH THE IT HAS BEEN REDUCE IT IS STILL. ON THE NOT QUITE DOUBLE- THE STATE AVERAGE. ARE YOU HAVE HIGH RATES OF POVERTY- TWENTY TWO PER. POINT 6% VERSUS THE CALIFORNIA FIFTEEN PERCENT- AND WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT- BECAUSE THE ECONOMY IS SO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON A NATURALLY DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY- THESE- THESE STATUSES. CAN ONLY ARE AT RISK OF GETTING MUCH WORSE AND WE CAN ONLY. LOOK BACK TO TWENTY FOURTEEN WHEN THE OIL AND GAS. OIL PRICES DROPPED- AND WE SAW A VERY LARGE IMPACTS TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY- SO IT IS. VULNERABLE TO THE OIL AND GAS INDUSTRY THE FUNCTION. THEIR. SO THIS IS WHAT'S HAPPENING ARE IN CALIFORNIA- WE HAVE SEEN A PRODUCTION IN CALIFORNIA AND THAT'S IS ONLY EXPECTED TO CONTINUE- I THINK THE PROJECTIONS ARE ANOTHER 26% IN THE NEXT DECADE. AND THESE PROJECTIONS I BASED ON CURRENT CONDITIONS THIS IS NOT ACCOUNT FOR ANY REGULATORY OR UNEXPECTED MARKET CHANGES SO WE KNOW OF REGARDLESS OF THAT KERN COUNTY AND CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE DECLINING IN ITS PRODUCTION AND THAT HOUSE IMPACTS ON ECONOMIES AND WORKFORCE THAT WE NEED TO ADDRESS REGARDLESS. SO. WHY IS THE OIL FILL OR PRODUCTION DECLINING. FRANKLY THE FIELDS ARE OLD AND THE OIL IS HEAVY. I'M SO WHILE THERE'S A SHALE OIL BOOMS IN OTHER PLACES LIKE TEXAS LIKE NORTH DAKOTA- CALIFORNIA COULD IS MORE EXPENSIVE TO EXTRACT ACCRUED WEIGHTS ARE COMPARABLE TO THE TAR SANDS IN CANADA. SO IN TERMS OF GETTING UP OUT OF THE WATER WE DO NEED TO HAVE A STEAM INJECTIONS IN ORDER TO EAT IT UP OTHERWISE THE CONSISTENCY IS MORE LIKE PEANUT BUTTER ON SO WHEN YOU COMPARE THAT TO OTHER AREAS ARE THERE IS A RELATIVE DISINCENTIVE I'M AND LESS PROFITABILITY FOR THE OIL AND GAS COMPANIES. TO DRILL HERE. IT ALSO MEANS THAT CALIFORNIA'S CREEK CALIFORNIA'S CRUDE IS SOME OF THE MOST HIGHLY IMPACTFUL TO CLIMATE UP COMPARED TO UP FEELS FOUND OTHER OTHER PLACES. SO KERN IS GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THE PRODUCTION DECLINED REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER FACTORS THERE'S NO CHANGING THE AGE OF THE FIELDS AND THERE'S NO CHANGING THE QUALITY OF OUR CREATED. SO WHAT DOES THIS MEAN FOR KERN'S WORK FORCE. WELL HERE THIS IS THAT THESE ARE NUMBERS TO FROM A RECENT WITH BY REPORT ON. SHOWING THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCTION JOBS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT WE ALL HAVE SOME SHARED UNDERSTANDINGS OF THE JOBS THAT ARE AT STAKE AND I HAVE SEEN A LOT OF ELEVATED FIGURES. ARE COMING OUT AND SO I DECIDED TO TAKE WAS WAS NUMBERS- I THINK THERE'S PROBABLY EVEN SOME MORE DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE NUMBERS. ALSO HERE AGAIN WE SEE WHAT THE NATURAL DECLINE IN OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION WE ARE GOING TO SEE. REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF JOBS AVAILABLE. ON SO THAT THIS IS HAPPENING. I'M I WILL SAY THAT A LOT OF THE JOBS FIGURES THAT WE SEE ON A COMING FOR THE OIL GAS INDUSTRY ACCOUNT FOR RETAIL GESTATION JOBS- AND I THINK AS WE MOVE FORWARD WITH THE DIFFERENT REGULATORY PROCESSES. WE NEED TO BE VERY CAREFUL ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A MANAGE DECLINE. TOM SO WE ALREADY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF JOB REPLACEMENT FOR KERN COUNTY AGAIN REGARDLESS OF ANY OTHER ADDITIONAL FACTORS. SO THIS IS THE OF COMPASS A GRAPH OF A COMPOSITION OF THE AGE AND I THINK THIS IS REALLY TELLING ON THIS ACTUALLY FOUR COLUMNS HERE. THE FIRST COLUMN IS A TINY BLUE FLAVOR WHICH REPRESENTS WORK- WORKERS JUST ENTERING THE WORKFORCE. AT UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY TWO. SO WECAN SEE THAT WE'RE NOT GETTING NEW YOUNG WORKERS ENTERING INTO THE FIELD- AND CONVERSELY WE CAN SEE THAT OVER THIRTY FIVE AND OVER QUARTER IS OVER FIFTY FIVE SO THAT'S ACTUALLY VERY GOOD NEWS FOR KERN COUNTY- AS- A SIZEABLE PERCENT OF THE WORK FORCE- WILL. THE SORRY THE WORKFORCE I TRANSITION NEEDS CAN BE OFFSET BY THE OLDER WORKERS LEAVING THE WORK FORCE OVERTIME. THIS IS JUST ANOTHER GRAPH SHOWING THE SAME THING BUT SHOWING THAT THIS TRAJECTORY. HAS HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER THE TIME SO AS THE YEARS GO BY WE HAVE FEWER AND FEWER YOUNG PERSON PEOPLE ENTERING THE FIELD AND WE SEE HIGHER AND HIGHER PERCENTAGES OF OLDER WORKERS SO IN TERMS OF THE ARGUMENTS ABOUT THE WORKFORCE. WE AGREE THAT WE NEED TO HAVE GOOD JOBS- HOWEVER- IN TERMS OF HOW PAINFUL THAT IS GOING TO BE FOR CURRENT I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE WOULD HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS. WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE COST OF LOSING OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION WE NEED TO COMPARE THAT TO THE HEALTH COSTS THAT WE HAVE NOW WITH THE CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES ARE SO HERE'S JUST A QUICK. A GRAPH ON THIS JUST SHOWS OF THE DIFFERENCE IN CHRONIC LOWER RESPIRATORY DISEASE DEATH IN CALIFORNIA SO WE CAN SEE KERN COUNTY JUST ASTRONOMICALLY ABOVE ANY OTHER COUNTY OF THESE ILLNESSES INCLUDE THINGS LIKE OUT SOME THERE IS A AMAZING STATISTIC THAT ONE OUT OF EVERY THIRTY SEVEN PEOPLE IN CURRENT DIED FROM CHRONIC RESPIRATORY DISEASE BETWEEN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. THIS IS TWELVE TIMES HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE STATE- ASTHMA COSTS KERN COUNTY NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION AND HEALTH CARE COSTS AND LOST PRODUCTIVITY EVERY YEAR AND RECENTLY WE JUST SAW ANOTHER STUDY THAT CAME OUT SHOWING THAT DIRTY AIR. COST CALIFORNIA ECONOMY TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY SO WE NEED TO HAVE A HOLISTIC- PICTURE OF THE COST OF OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION. I'M HERE SOME QUICK FLY JUST SHOWING THE RELATIVE- CONTRIBUTION OF OIL AND GAS SO EVERYTHING YOU SEE THERE A WITH THE RED STRIPES THAT'S OIL AND GAS- CONTRIBUTIONS OF THIS IS A MEASUREMENT OF. A TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS OF OIL AND GAS ACTIVITIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR BETWEEN THIRTY AND 60% OF TACK EMISSIONS IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. NOT THAT THAT LARGE ONE IS FROM ALL THE HIDE FOR EXAMPLE. OIL AND GAS FACILITIES ARE ALSO THE LARGEST STATIONARY SOURCES OF DIRECT PM TWO POINT FIVE IN THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. JUST FOR CORPORATIONS CHEVRON AIR ENERGY BERRY PETROLEUM AND PLANES. EXPLORATION ACCOUNT FOR HALF. OF ALL PM TWO POINT FIVE EMISSIONS FROM LARGE STATIONARY SOURCES IN THE VALLEY. OF FOR COMPARISON THIS IS MORE DIRECT PM TWO POINT FIVE THAN IT IS PRODUCED BY ALL PASSENGER VEHICLES AND LIGHT AND MEDIUM DUTY TRUCKS COMBINED. WE ALSO NEED TO CONSIDER COST TO WATER. ON THE IN TWENTY NINETEEN THE STATE WATER BOARD FOUND THAT WATER SUPPLY WELLS IN KERN HAVE. OIL INDUSTRY POLLUTANTS- IN THEM. THERE'S ALSO BEEN RECENT STUDIES SHOWING INCREASED SALINITY. I DID A PRODUCED OUT WASTEWATER DISPOSAL AND KERN OIL FIELDS. IN ADDITION TO THE WATER CONTAMINATION WE ALSO HAVE- THE HIVE WATER USE- IN CALIFORNIA. UP STUDIES DO LINK APPROXIMATE OIL AND GAS WELLS TO HOST OF HEALTH IMPACTS INCLUDING INCREASE WITH OF ASTHMA AND OTHER RESPIRATORY ILLNESSES PREMATURE DEATHS HIGH RISK PREGNANCY AND CANCER- THE CLOSER PEOPLE LIVE TO OIL AND GAS WELLS THE MORE LIKELY THEY WILL BE EXPOSED TO TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS LIKE WE JUST DISCUSSED. ON AND THE MORE ELEVATED THE RISK ASSOCIATED HEALTH EFFECTS AND OF COURSE CHILDREN- ARE THE MOST SENSITIVE POPULATIONS I TO THESE OIL AND GAS WELLS. SO WE NEED A JUST TRANSITION. ARM WE NEED THIS JUST TRANSITION TO BE LED BY WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED. WE NEED TO DO OF WHAT WORKERS NEED TO FEEL WHOLE. ARM AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT BENEFITS ACCRUE TO THE COMMUNITY SO I THINK THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF. MISTAKES MISTAKES MADE IN TERMS OF THE OF THE JUST TRANSITION CONVERSATION BECAUSE WORKERS HAVE NOT BEEN ENOUGH AT THE TABLE MOM AND I THINK IT'S GOTTEN A BAD RAP FRANKLY AT THIS POINT AND SO I THINK WE NEED TO RE BRAND JUST TRANSITION AND DO IT RIGHT IN CALIFORNIA. AND WE NEED TO START IN KERN COUNTY- AND I THINK THAT STARTS WITH LET'S TALK TO LABOR AND THAT HAVE THE BE CENTRAL AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE THERE IN TERMS OF WHAT DO THEY NEED. TO FEEL LIKE THEY ARE OKAY- TRANSITIONING TO A NEW JOB AND A AND A- THE NEW ECONOMY. I IN KERN COUNTY THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE ON THE HORIZON FOR ONE WE SEE A YOUNGER DEMOGRAPHIC AS- HOUSING PRICES RISE ACROSS THE STATE WERE SEEN YOUNG PEOPLE RETURN AFTER COLLEGE WHICH WASN'T DIDN'T USED TO BE THE CASE SO HAVING MORE YOUNG AT COLLEGE EDUCATED OF PEOPLE MOVING IN WE SING A REVITALIZATION OF DOWNTOWN WE'RE SEEING HOTEL GROWTH- OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY A BIT WISE IS A FLEDGLING TECH COMPANY- THERE'S ONE IN FRESNO NOW THERE'S ONE IN BAKERSFIELD- SO THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE IN KERN COUNTY- WE ALSO HAVE WE TALKED A LOT ABOUT ABANDONED. AND ORPHANED WELLS THERE IS A BIG OPPORTUNITIES FOR SOIL REMEDIATION AND CLEAN UP WELL ABANDONMENT AND PLUGGING ON AS WELL AS- WE NEED TO LOOK AT PROPERTY TAXES ON NEWLY EMERGING SECTORS. SO JUST TO. UP FINISH UP WE NEED TO CREATE A JUST TRANSITION AND KERN COUNTY. AND WE NEED TO DEDICATE SIGNIFICANT STATE FUNDS- TO HELP RESIDENTS BUSINESSES AND COMMUNITIES TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES- AND WE NEED TO DO AN ANALYSIS. OF THE ASSETS IN OPPORTUNITIES TO DIVERSIFY THE ECONOMY- THE TAKE AWAY AS THE TRANSITION AWAY FROM OIL AND GAS IN CALIFORNIA IS INEVITABLE. AND IF WE DON'T PLAN FOR IT AND IT'S NOT MANAGED KERN COUNTY IS GOING TO BE LEFT BEHIND AND THE ECONOMY IS GOING TO BE DECIMATED- RIGHT NOW I THINK KERN COUNTY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO BRING IT TO BRING IN SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT ON AND REALLY OPEN THE DOORS TO A BETTER FUTURE FOR CAR. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS RESTAURANT. MR WITH A COUPLE QUESTION ALL RIGHT. SHE THE WORK YOU'VE BEEN DOING OUT IN THE COMMUNITY AND. YEAH THE GRAVITY OF THE HEALTH CHALLENGE AND- SO BRING INFORMATION LIKE WISE ON. OUR PATROLLING ADDICTION. I ALWAYS USE YET THIRD LARGEST CONSUMER OF PETROLEUM IN THE WORLD ALTHOUGH. I THINK THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE MIGHT BE DISPENSED TERMS OF JURISDICTIONS OF. BUT WERE. WE'RE WE'RE VERY DEEPLY. EMBEDDED IN THIS PROBLEM- I GUESS I HAD HAD LESS KIND OF GLOBAL QUESTIONS FOR YOU BOTH AND MUCH MORE SPECIFIC SO I GUESS I'D START WITH MISS RIOS BOYD MAIN. IN TERMS OF JUST. MAKING CAL GEM A JAM TRULY FUNCTIONAL AGENCY. SOME OF THE BACKLOG ISSUES WE TALKED ABOUT TODAY THEY GOT SIX REPORTS OUT THIS LAST WEEK BUT. JUST HOW TO ACTUALLY BUILD TRUST IN THE COMMUNITY RIGHT AND- ESPECIALLY WHEN THE SORT OF. WHEN IT GETS REALLY INTIMATE. ARE YOU HAVE YOU ALL LOOKED AT THEIR THEIR BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL- AND EFFORTS TO BEEF UP THE AGENCIES SORT OF STAFFING CAPACITY AND- YEAH HAVE YOU HAVE YOU TAKEN A LOOK AT IT ARE YOU SUPPORTIVE OF IT. HERE IS TO GET YOUR TAKE ON- HOW TO GET YOU KNOW BEYOND DOGGER AND REALLY GET THAT AGENCY FUNCTIONAL WHICH SEEMS BEYOND THIS SORT OF LARGER QUESTION OF HOW THE FOSSIL FUEL FUTURE GOES. INTO THERE'S PRETTY COMMON INTEREST IN HAVING A FUNCTIONAL AGENCY THERE SO. COMMENTS ON THAT APPRECIATE THE QUESTION YEAH- AND YES WE CERTAINLY AND HAVE I THINK YOU CAN LOOK IN OUR HISTORY THIS ISN'T THE FIRST BUDGET PROPOSAL. TO INCREASE RESOURCES CORRECT- AT THAT APARTMENT SO I THINK WE DON'T WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT MAKING SURE THAT THE AGENCY HAS THE RESOURCES IT NEEDS. TO RE ESTABLISH ITS CREDIBILITY AND TO CONTINUE THIS ENERGY PATHWAY THAT WE HAVE IN THE STATE FOR THE PRODUCTION OF OUR CRUDE OIL HERE LOCALLY. AND OUR ABILITY TO REFINE IT SO- I DO WANT TO CLARIFY ONE POINT THAT I THINK WE PROBABLY DISAGREE ON. AND THAT WOULD BE THAT IT IS INEVITABLE THAT THE PRODUCTION IN THE STATE IS DECLINING AND SHOULD CONTINUE AND SHOULD GO AWAY. THAT IS THE FARTHEST FROM THE TRUTH WE ARE A VERY THE RESERVES AND CURRENT COUNTY ARE STILL AMONG THIS IS RESERVES IN THE GROUND AND YOU CAN TALK TO THE KERN COUNTY TAX ASSESSOR WHO ASSESSES US ON. RESERVES IN THE GROUND- IS THE HIGHEST IN THE NATION IT REMAINS TO BE. IF YOU THIS PRODUCTION THE STATE WERE IT IT RESPONDS REALLY WELL TO INVESTMENT AND SO THE MORE INVESTMENT THAT'S MADE IF YOU CAN MAKE AN ECONOMIC INVESTMENT. THE MORE OR WILL BE PRODUCED IN THAT GRAPH WILL TURN AROUND FROM WHAT IT SHOWING. SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S A NATURAL DECLINE IS DECLINING FOR SEVERAL REASONS ONE OF WHICH IS IF YOU CAN'T INVEST ECONOMICALLY. IT WILL CONTINUE TO APPLY BUT IF YOU CAN IT RESPONSE QUITE WELL TO IT AND HAS FOR YOU KNOW A HUNDRED YEARS. CUT BUT I DO. THAT YOU SEE AND HAVE SEEN CONTINUAL SUPPORT BY THIS INDUSTRY IN ALL FACETS OF ALL THE THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AND- LIKE I SAID IM PERSONALLY INVESTED IN THE SIX SEVENTEEN PROGRAM- WHICH AGAIN. HAVING COMMUNITIES STEP TO THE PLATE AND TAKE LEADERSHIP AS THEY HAVE IS JUST AMAZING. AND TO HAVE THAT ABILITY TO USE SCIENCE. TO PUT MONITORS IN COMMUNITIES FIGURE OUT WHERE THINGS ARE COMING FROM AND THEN WHAT MITIGATION PLANS WERE GOING TO DO TO REDUCE SOME. THAT'S REMARKABLE. ON AND- FOR THAT SO FOR THIS TACK NUMBERS SHE GAVE IN THE PM TWO POINT FIVE ANY DISPUTE WITH THOSE NUMBER I COULD PUT UP AS MANY SHOT SLIDE SHOWING THE ABSOLUTE IMPROVEMENTS IN ALL OF THOSE THAT THIS INDUSTRY IS MADE OVER TIME IN THE GRASS WOULD BE GOING. THIS WAY. SO I GET OUT WE CAN HAVE CONTINUED DISCUSSION ON THAT I THINK YOU WOULD SEE- THE OTHER ONE IS THE KERN COUNTY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT THE MOST AGGRESSIVE PROGRAM THAT THAT THE THAT COUNTY PUT IN PLACE. TO MITIGATE ALL MEASURES UP FRONT FOR TWENTY YEARS OF PRODUCTION. UNBELIEVABLE REMARKABLE PROGRAM THAT KERN COUNTY INITIATED WITH THE- COOPERATION OF THE INDUSTRY- AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'VE DEMONSTRATED. IS COOPERATION IN ALL OF THESE ASPECTS. LIKE I SAID SB EIGHTY THREE IS WRITING A REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR REQUIRED BY A SPEEDY THREE. BROAD BASED STAKEHOLDER GROUP CLEAN WATER WATCH ENERGY SEE EVERYBODY MYSELF- WRITING A REPORT ON UNDERGROUND JUNCTION CONTROL ARE THERE ANY GAPS ARE WE MISSING ANYTHING. BECAUSE IF WE ARE WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO TO PLUG THE- SAME KIND OF A THING WITH THE OR FOR NOT A WELL ISSUE. I CAN SINCE I'VE BEEN DOING THIS FOR A LONG TIME I CAN REMEMBER WHEN YOU ALL ASKED US TO STEP UP TO THE PLATE ON OR FOR NOT A WELL BILL. BILL WHERE WE HAD WE DIDN'T HAVE WE DIDN'T HAVE A FUND. AND WE STEPPED UP PLACE TO PUT I THINK SIX MILLION DOLLARS ON THE TABLE COLLECTIVELY TO. HAVE THAT FUND NOW WE NEED TO GROW IT AND DEAL WITH ISSUE AND ALL WERE REVIEWING THE CCS SUPPORT IF YOU ALL ARE I HAVEN'T. CAN'T SEPARATE YET BUT I WILL- AND SO I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO COMMUNICATE IS THAT THIS INDUSTRY. WHAT STEP THE PLATE ON ALL THESE ISSUES. HE AS YOU VAST TO COME ON THE- TO. GOAL WE REAL A- THERE TO FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT I THINK YOU HEARD FROM OUR MEMBER IN THE PREVIOUS PANEL THAT. WERE WERE ALL ABOUT STEPPING UP THE PLATE FIGURING IT OUT AND I WOULD SAY ON A WORK FORCE- WE'RE VERY EXCITED OF THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT WE HAVE WITH PEOPLE LIKE THE BUILDING TRADES WHO WILL TAKE PEOPLE WITH VERY LITTLE- TRAINING AND EDUCATION PUT THEM THROUGH AN APPRENTICESHIP. PROGRAM TRAIN THEM AND PAY THEM THROUGH THAT TRAINING AND WE'RE ABLE TO OFFER JOBS WHEN THEY COME OUT OF THAT APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAM- IMMEDIATELY SO. I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF EXCITING WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT ISSUES I WOULD SAY AS FAR AS THE YOUNGER GENERATION- WE HAVE A GROUP CALLED THE YOUNG PROFESSIONALS THAT ARE VERY EXCITED ABOUT OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS INDUSTRY I'VE HIRED RECENTLY. HI I'M I'M THINK A QUARTER OF MY STEPS MILLENNIALS NOW WHO ARE IN COMMUNICATIONS WHO ARE IN TECHNICAL ISSUES WHO ARE IN YOU KNOW REGULATORY ISSUES WHO HAVE EXPERTISE AND ENVIRONMENTAL. SO I THINK THERE'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO CONTINUE TO OFFER BROAD OPPORTUNITIES OF EMPLOYMENT AS WE GO FORWARD AND AS I'VE SAID WE DON'T NEED A TRANSITION JUST BECAUSE WE'RE TRANSITIONING RELATIVE TO THE ENERGY MIX BECAUSE WERE ALREADY IN IT. AND ALREADY USE IN OUR WORK FORCE ON IT SO. I THAT'S A PRETTY GOOD JUST. BUT BUT IN TERMS OF. THAT TAKING RESPONSIBILITY. MANTRA I GET THAT. IT MAY IT MAY BE BETTER THAN IT'S EVER BEEN IN YOUR VIEW BUT NO NO. ACTUAL DISPUTE ABOUT. STATIONARY SOURCE PM TWO POINT FIVE CONTRIBUTION OR THE TACK FRONT SO I MEAN THAT'S NO I'M NOT I'M NOT HERE THAT FOR YOU BUT- BUT IN TERMS OF THE HEALTH COSTS. OF I'VE HEARD YOU BRING UP SIX SEVENTEEN. SO WORST WE'RE STRUGGLING STILL WITH FUNDING THERE FRANKLY AND WE'VE SEEN. POULTRY PROGRESS IN MY VIEW- KERN COUNTY YES BUT- I TO STATE WHY WE'RE STILL STRUGGLING AND EVERYONE HAS TO. YOU KNOW YOU'RE GET LUCKY TO GET THE GRANTS AND HOPEFULLY YOU GET SOME SENSE OF WHAT'S ACTUALLY HAPPENING ON YOUR NOSE SO. MAYES INDUSTRY LOOKING AT ANY CREATIVE SOLUTIONS TO. BEYOND EVEN OFFSETTING THE NET HEALTH COSTS ACTUALLY JUST HELPING US GET- A FRAMEWORK IN PLACE THAT'S GONNA BE. FUNDED AND DURABLE- I MEAN WE CAN KEEP GOING BACK TO TAXPAYERS ARE THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUND BUT- IT'S FRUSTRATING HAVE TO EVERY YEAR FIGHT FOR THAT POT I MEAN ANY ANY THOUGHTS ON WELL OTHER THAN WE CONTRIBUTE MAJORLY TO THE GREENHOUSE SURE YOU. RIGHT RIGHT LIKE A PART IN IT ENDS UP GOING OTHER THINGS AND THEY WERE AND WE WANT TO FOCUS ON MITIGATION NOT JUST STRICTLY MONITORING AND THERE IT'S A LARGE AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT THERE'S TOO MANY REQUESTS FOR RIGHT RIGHT SO I THINK PRIORITIZING. HOW YOU SPEND THAT MONEY I WOULD CHALLENGE US ALL TO LOOK FOR INCREASED FUNDING FOR SIX SEVENTEEN WHO DID TEND COMMUNITIES LAST YEAR WE'RE ONLY GONNA HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO DO THREE THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE YEAH SO ANGRY THAT I MADE MY GREW WITH YOU. SO I DO THINK WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO GO FORWARD ON THAT PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE FRANKLY WE HAVE FOUR HUNDRED COMMUNITIES AND WE'VE ONLY DONE TEN. RIGHT RIGHT BUT WHAT WAS WHAT WAS BRILLIANT IN MY MIND ABOUT THAT PROGRAM IN ALL OF YOU PASSING IT WAS THAT IT REALLY IS A FOUNDATION OF WHAT YOU'VE BEEN HEARING THIS WHOLE HEARING WHICH IS. LET SIGN DICTATE THE ANSWER RIGHT WE ALL WE'RE ALL GOING INTO THIS WITH WHAT WE IT MAY BE US IT MIGHT NOT BE A- BUT IF IT IS A STEP TO PLAY FOR TO DEAL WITH. RIGHTS PUT THAT SIGN SIMPLE MAKE COMMENTS WHAT WE DO SO CANNOT HEALTH ISSUES THAT COMMUNITIES ABOUT BILL. SO WE KNOW WE WERE ABOUT AT NIGHT DAMAGE THAT CONTINUED THE. FIRST REMAIN AM. I WAS SIX SEVEN IS JUST ONE TINY PIECE OF. THE MORAL TO DEAL THIS GRAY RIGHT BUT AT I AM AND FROM YOUR- YOUR FOCUS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT- I MEAN IS THERE PROGRESS WE CAN BE MAKING THIS YEAR ON THAT MONITORING FRONT DOOR ON ON DEALING WITH. NOT HAVING IT IS A TAX THE GDR F. ME HAVE YOU GUYS GIVEN ANY THOUGHT TO WHAT. ACTUALLY HE GETTING OUR COMMUNITIES ADEQUATELY. YEAH MONITORS AT THIS POINT WE YOU KNOW MONITORING IS NOT THE ANSWER I MEAN TIME TO COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES NO. YOU KNOW THEY WANT TO SEE THEY WANT TO SEE REDUCTIONS ARE- AND SO THE OVERLY OVERLY FOCUS EMPHASIS ON ON MODERATE MONITORING- WHEN YOU KNOW YOU'RE JUST ADDING TO THE POLLUTION BURDENS ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH. ON AND SO WITHOUT HAVING MANDATED REDUCTIONS I'M A IN COMMUNITIES IT IT IT IT IT'S REALLY TOO LITTLE TOO LATE- SO YOU KNOW I THINK THAT TWO HUNDRED MILLION WAS YOUR ESTIMATE OF HEALTH CARE COSTS WITHIN KERN COUNTY I THINK THAT WAS A STUDY THAT YEAH AND THEN YOU'D- THINK YOU GIVE TWENTY. BILLION FOR AIR POLLUTION WRIT LARGE WHICH IS ALSO MOBILE SOURCES I'M SURE IF IT WAS THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION RELATED TO. I OIL INDUSTRY OPERATIONS SO THAT WAS FOUR MEASURE INTERNET. HEALTH COSTS ON THE HEIRS HAYES AND- YEAH WELL THAT WAS A THAT WAS THE ESTIMATE FOR KERN COUNTY- FOR THE AIR POLLUTION BURDEN- I THINK WE WOULD SUBMIT THAT OIL AND GAS. MAKES UP A SIZEABLE PERCENT OF THAT BUT OF COURSE YOUR HONOR THE ISSUES WITH KERN COUNTY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. IS THERE'S A LOT OF POLLUTION BURDENS CRACKED SO. YEAH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE I GUESS IN IN SUBSEQUENT MONTHS IN IF WE CAN DO THE ANALYSIS ON ON AND MAYBE IT ALREADY EXISTS BUT THE ATTRIBUTION OF THAT COST THAT HEALTH CARE COSTS ON THE OIL SIDE AND WHAT DO YOU RESPONSE REALLY REALLY LOOKS LIKE AND- MAYBE PART OF ITS MONITORING ANDPART OF ITS MITIGATING AND- HOW THAT LOOKS. TRY TO CHIP AWAY AT THAT SORT OF WITH THE SCATTER SHOT APPROACH. THAT SYMBOLIZED ENCOURAGES TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING IN THEM YEAH YOU KNOW OF COURSE LIKE I MEAN HEY WE'RE HESITANCY SHOES YOUR NGUYEN HAS ITS ISSUES OF COURSE. HOW LITHIUM IS DRYING OR ELECTRIC VEHICLE- NAY MATTER HE SAYS THERE ISSUES YEAH SO IT'S NOT JUST. YOU KNOW ALL ENERGY SOURCES HAVE THINGS TO DEAL WITH IT'S A COMPLEX PROBLEM SO LET'S JUST LOOK AT IT IN ITS IN ITS ENTIRETY. B. YES. THOUGHTS ON THE CARBON YOU TRILOGY CONVERSATION IS BRUSH FROM THAT BE MY LAST QUESTION TO YOU HOW DO YOU LOOK AT THE THAT STUDY THE AYE AYE POP UP I MEAN I TUNE INTO SOME OF THE HEARING BUT. LIKE YOU'RE SORT OF UNSATISFIED WITH MONITORING THIS CARBON NEUTRALITY DO YOU SEEM LIKE THE RIGHT ALIGNING GOAL OR OR YOU LOOKING AT A DIFFERENT APPROACH WILL WORK SAID ABOUT THE STUDY- WE ARE- AND THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE'RE LOOKING BOTH AT SUPPLY AND DEMAND BECAUSE THAT REALLY IS GOT TO BE PART OF. THE EQUATION I'M WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO RAMP DOWN OUR DEMAND IN CALIFORNIA THERE'S NO DEBATE THERE- WE ALSO NEED TO RAMP DOWN OUR SUPPLIES SO I THINK- HAVING THOSE STUDIES AND HAVING OPPORTUNITIES TO BE INVOLVED IN IN THE STUDIES I THINK IS REALLY CRITICAL I'M MOST PLEASED THAT THE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT FOLKS AT THE STATE ARE VERY INVOLVED IN IN IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE TO ME THAT'S YOU KNOW THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST PIECES- IS THAT WE MAKE SURE- YOU KNOW THAT WE HAVE KIND OF A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO LOOKING AT THE WORK FORCE- LOOKING AT YOU KNOW RAMPING DOWN PRODUCTION IN A- YOU KNOW. MEASURED AND RESPONSIBLE WAY ON MAKING SURE THAT NOBODY GETS LEFT OUT- SO I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE STATE- AND REVIEWING THIS STUDY SO I THINK IT'S A IT'S A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT IT REALLY IS NOT MUCH MONEY IN THERE- AND IS A BIG A BIG QUINCY MILLION DOLLARS TOWARDS THAT LAST YEAR SOMEONE THREE MILLION YEAH FOR BOTH FOR BOTH- SUCH A MASSIVE PROMOTES A WRIT LARGE WE'RE UNDER SHOOTING IT TERMS OF HOW BRING ALL THIS WORK OUT- WE WERE FINDING CAL JIM RIGHT NOW- THE TREE SO THAT ARE AVAILABLE FOR SICK SEVEN IN THIS OR ANY QUITE TO GOT A- USE UP. WHAT GOT A WRESTLE AT. AND ABOUT THIS CLIMATE OF. EN GET OIL MAJORS TO WAY UP A SERIES. A CHALLENGE THEM I LIKE THERE'S SOME. NEAR TERM OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE HAVE. STRANGELY ALIGNED INTEREST HERE- THAT SEEM LIKE WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO MOVE SOMETHING FORWARD THIS YEAR- YEAH I THINK OF LIKE I WANT KERN COUNTY. TO HAVE KNOWLEDGE AND- SOME POWER OVER WHAT'S IMPACTING THEIR HEALTH BUT- YOU KNOW. YOU DOCTOR WHERE PEOPLE PRAY. I GO TO SYNAGOGUE AND ON PICO IN LA WE GOT. THINGS GO PACIFIC. COAST ENERGY PRODUCERS DOUG MATT. TO SITES RIGHT LA ALL THEY WANT IS A MONITOR RIGHT AND YET THEY'RE GONNA BE BACK A LINE BECAUSE THEY'RE IN LA AND THERE'S OTHER PLACES. BUT THEN YOU GOT A LEASE SO CAN YOU JUST SEEMS LIKE A RAW DEAL FOR COMMUNITIES ACTUALLY. WANT TO KNOW WHAT'S IMPACTING THEM BUT- WE APPRECIATE- YOUR TESTIMONY HERE- MA'AM VICE CHAIR THIS THAT'S ALL- CHAIR I THAT'S ALL I HAD FOR THEM. THANK I JUST HAVE TO THINK QUICK QUESTION THE FOR ONE FROM BOYD. HAVE YOU BEEN GIVEN ANY TIMELINE FOR WHEN THE AUDITS AND REVIEWS ARE GOING TO BE COMPLETE AND I'M JUST WONDERING BESIDES THE SPECULATION AND THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THE- NEW POLICIES FROM THE FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION ARE YOU SEEING ANY IMMEDIATE SORT OF CONCRETE EFFECTS ON YOUR MEMBERS YES THERE ARE SEVERAL MEMBERS WHO HAVE HAD TO- EITHER LAY DOWN A RIG OR- YOU KNOW. HAVE LESS EMPLOYMENT AS A RESULT OF SORT OF WAITING WE HAVEN'T GOT ANY CLEAR FINAL. PERIOD OF TIME WHEN WE'RE GOING TO SEE THINGS FLOWING AGAIN SO- VERY ANXIOUS. TO HEAR THAT FROM THE STATE AS THEY COMPLETE THEIR REVIEWS THROUGH LAWRENCE LIVERMORE NATIONAL LABS I KNOW THOSE ARE ON GOING IN THERE. DETAILED AND THEY TAKE TIME BUT WERE ANXIOUS TO GET THEM COMPLETE I'M CONFINED CONFIDENT THAT. THEY WILL SHOW WHAT THEY ALWAYS SHOW WHICH WE DO SO I'VE BEEN THROUGH EIGHT STUDIES NOW. JUST TO NOTE THE LAST TWO YEARS. HELP OKAY THANK YOU AND THEN FOR MISS BROADS- BRUSHED HIM- OF ALL OF THE DIFFERENT ADMIT- NEW INITIATIVES FROM THE NEWS MINISTRATION IS THERE ANYTHING THAT RISES TO THE TOP TO YOU AS SORT OF THE MOST EXCITING FOR YOUR GROUP YES DEFINITELY THE HEALTH AND SAFETY RULE MAKING- PROCESS- AND ESPECIALLY THE POSSIBILITY A LIKELIHOOD THAT. A SET BACK BOB WILL BE INCLUDED BECAUSE THAT IS THE TOP PRIORITY THAT WE'RE HEARING FROM RESIDENTS BOTH AND CURRENT AND IN LA- THAT THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT TO SAY SO THAT THAT'S WHAT'S MOST EXCITING TO US RIGHT WELL I WANT TO THANK THE TWO OF YOUR MEN. MISCELLANY SO HAVE NO. RIGHT I WANT TO THANK OF YOU FOR COMING AND I WANT TO COMMEND STAFF FOR THE STRUCTURE OF THIS HEARING BECAUSE I. REALLY APPRECIATE- NOW THAT WE'RE KIND OF TOWARDS THE END WE STILL HAVE PUBLIC COMMENTARY. BUT I APPRECIATE THAT WE STARTED WITH THE VERY ASPIRATIONAL- AND VISION OF THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THEN WENT TO LOOKING AT ALMOST SORT OF IN A SNAPSHOT IN TIME OF THE CURRENT SITUATION AND HOW THAT'S UNFOLDING. AND NOW WE HAVE. TWO SPEAKERS WHO AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CHALLENGES BOTH OF CONTINUING. OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION. AND THE CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO RAMP DOWN ON OIL AND GAS EXPLORATION AND- I THINK UNDERSTANDING THOSE COMPLEXITIES THAT IT'S NOT AN EASY. CONVERSATION IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S A QUICK EASY ANSWER THAT'S GOING TO ADDRESS ALL THOSE CONCERNS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE PUBLIC TO UNDERSTAND AS WE CONTINUE. OUR THE STYLE I CAN CONTINUE THE REGULATION- SETTING. A FRAMEWORK THAT WERE IN HERE IN THE CAPITAL SO I THINK YOU BOTH FOR ENDING US ON THAT NOTE. IT WAS REALLY- IS REALLY- VERY CLEAR AND- I THINK REALLY IMPORTANT SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND AS WE MOVE NOW TO PUBLIC- TESTIMONY I WAS ASKED TO READ INTO THE RECORD A LETTER- WHICH I WILL DO- FROM. US SENATOR DIANNE FEINSTEIN SO IF YOU TOLD ME ONE MOMENT THE SENATOR DID ASK US TO READ THIS INTO THE RECORD. SHE GETS THE FOR COMMENT SHE DOESN'T HAVE A TIME LIMIT- SO I WILL BE THIS AS QUICKLY AS I CAN. AND IT. A READ I WOULD LIKE. YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP STYLE SIDE TEARS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEES AND NATURAL RESOURCES. AND RIGHT TO EXPRESS MY STRONG SUPPORT FOR TODAY OVERSIGHT HEARING ON THE SERVER OIL SPILL OUT FUTURE THE- PRINCE'S. FOR CALIFORNIA. SEE WE CANNOT. WHERE TO CLEAN ENERGY FEW. AND TOO MANY SINCE THE ENVIRONMENTAL PASSED KOREAN CALIFORNIA I REMEMBER THIS BARBARA SPILL IN NINETEEN NINE THAT'S BUILD POINT MILLION OF OIL THEN IN NINETEEN SO ONE HUNDRED GALLONS A BUNKER FUEL SPILLED IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY AND IN NINETEEN NINETY AN OIL TANKER SPILLED MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED GALLONS OFF HUNTINGTON BEACH AND TODAY'S TOPIC THE ALMOST ONE MILLION GALLONS OF OIL AND WATER LEAKED IN KERN COUNTY. I COMMEND GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR BLOCKING ALL NEW FRACKING PERMITS UNTIL THEY CAN BE INDEPENDENTLY REVIEWED I ALSO SUPPORT HIS HALTING OF NEW PERMITS FOR HIGH PRESSURE STEAM INJECTED OIL DRILLING ENSURING THAT THESE INVASIVE AND POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS EXTRACTION METHODS ARE SAFE AND WON'T HARM HOME SCHOOLS HOSPITALS AND PARKS IS VITAL TO PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL I CONTINUE TO STRONGLY SUPPORT EFFORTS TO REGULATE THE OIL INDUSTRY'S EXTRACTION PROCESSES PARTICULAR FRACKING SPECIFICALLY THE FRACTURING RESPONSIBILITY IN AWARENESS OF CHEMICALS ACT OF WHICH I AM A CO SPONSOR IN THE U. S. SENATE WOULD CLOSE A LOOPHOLE THAT CURRENTLY EXAMS FRACKING FROM OVERSIGHT BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY THIS BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE WE'RE COMPANIES TO DISCLOSE THE CHEMICAL WITH. THE FACT IN THE. FIRST THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE- PROCESS THE BILL WOULD BE SURE THAT THE- AND FOR WRIST. CAN ROUTE. IF TALKS FRACTURE FRACKING CHEMICALS ARE FOUND IN SURFACE WATER AN UNDERGROUND DRINKING SOURCES. FURTHERMORE I AM COMMITTED TO PERMANENTLY BANNING OFFSHORE DRILLING IN FEDERAL WATERS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA'S TO CALIFORNIA. LAST YEAR I REINTRODUCE THE WEST COAST OCEAN PROTECTION ACT WHICH WOULD PERMANENTLY PROHIBIT OIL DRILLING IN THESE WATERS WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO COASTAL ECONOMIES AND HEALTHY MARINE ECO SYSTEMS. NEARLY 70% OF CALIFORNIANS OPPOSE OFFSHORE DRILLING ACCORDING TO RECENT POLLING BY THE PUBLIC POLICY INSTEAD OF CALIFORNIA. I AM PLEASED TO REPORT THAT OUR BILL RECENTLY PASSED THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES. AS PART OF A LARGER PACKAGE A BIPARTISAN LEGISLATION. MOST CRITICALLY I BELIEVE THAT ALL FUTURE DECISIONS ON FOSSIL FUEL EXPIRATION IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE CONSIDERED THROUGH THE LNS OF THE CLIMATE EMERGENCY FACING US ALL. CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE NATION AND TRANSITIONING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS AND WE MUST ALL TAKE WE MUST TAKE ALL RISK POSSIBLE MEASURES. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE ENVIRONMENT OUR NATURAL RESOURCES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. IT IS MY HOPE THAT THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE REGULATORY AGENCY THAT OVERSEES CALIFORNIA'S OIL INDUSTRY WILL MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE. CHANGING THE NAME OF THE DIVISION OF OIL GAS AND GEOTHERMAL RESOURCES TO THE GEO THE GEOLOGIC ENERGY MANAGEMENT DIVISION AND UPDATING THE AGENCIES PRIORITIES ARE POSITIVE FIRST STEPS. TO INSURE MORE EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND TO EXPEDITE THE REDUCTION OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. I AM HARKIN TODAY. I'M HARKEN THAT TODAY'S HEARING IS BEING HELD AND I COMMEND THE S.
