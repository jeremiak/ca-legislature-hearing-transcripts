00:33:16.694 --> 00:33:18.096
INCOME AND FOR WHOM THE STATUS

00:33:18.162 --> 00:33:19.997
QUO IS NOT PROVIDING GOOD

00:33:20.064 --> 00:33:22.700
SERVICE.

00:33:22.767 --> 00:33:26.904
I'M GOING TO MOVE.

00:33:26.971 --> 00:33:28.106
FAIRLY QUICKLY OF THROUGH THE

00:33:28.172 --> 00:33:29.974
SLIDES BUT I WANTED FIRST TO SAY

00:33:30.041 --> 00:33:31.509
A WORD ABOUT MY SOURCES.

00:33:31.576 --> 00:33:33.711
MOST OF THE INFORMATION --

00:33:33.778 --> 00:33:35.213
THAT I'M GOING TO PROVIDE TODAY

00:33:35.279 --> 00:33:36.981
CAN BE FOUND IN MENTAL HEALTH

00:33:37.048 --> 00:33:39.150
CARE IN CALIFORNIA FOR TOO MANY

00:33:39.217 --> 00:33:40.618
CARE NOT THERE WHICH IS ONE OF

00:33:40.685 --> 00:33:42.120
THE FOUNDATIONS ALMANAC

00:33:42.186 --> 00:33:43.654
PUBLICATIONS.

00:33:43.721 --> 00:33:44.288
THAT WE PUBLISHED ABOUT A YEAR

00:33:44.355 --> 00:33:45.156
AGO.

00:33:45.223 --> 00:33:47.125
AND THOSE COMPILE THE MOST

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:48.659
RECENT AVAILABLE DATE ON

00:33:48.726 --> 00:33:49.827
DIFFERENT TOPICS TO SHINE A

00:33:49.894 --> 00:33:51.262
LIGHT ON THE STATUS OF HEALTH

00:33:51.329 --> 00:33:53.097
CARE IN THE STATE.

00:33:53.164 --> 00:33:53.965
DATA IN THE ALMANAC COME FROM A

00:33:54.031 --> 00:33:55.767
WIDE VARIETY OF SOURCES FEDERAL

00:33:55.833 --> 00:33:57.268
DATA LIKE THE CENSUS --

00:33:57.335 --> 00:33:57.835

HEALTH OFSHE POT AND OTHERS.

00:34:06.778 --> 00:34:07.979
MUCH OF THE DATA THAT WE

00:34:08.045 --> 00:34:09.947
PUBLISHED LAST YEAR'S FROM

00:34:10.014 --> 00:34:11.516
TWENTY FOURTEEN AND TWENTY

00:34:11.582 --> 00:34:12.116
FIFTEEN IT IS STILL THE MOST

00:34:12.183 --> 00:34:12.850
RECENT AVAILABLE.

00:34:12.917 --> 00:34:14.652
BUT THERE HAVE BEEN OBVIOUSLY

00:34:14.719 --> 00:34:15.887
VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES SINCE

00:34:15.953 --> 00:34:18.289
THEN MOST NOTABLY THE EXPANSION

00:34:18.356 --> 00:34:19.290
OF MEDICARE ALL --

00:34:19.357 --> 00:34:20.925
AS WELL AS OTHER CHANGES IN OUR

ENFORCEMENT OF PARITY LAWS AND

00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.028
OTHER THINGS OF THAT IS WORTH

00:34:24.095 --> 00:34:25.196
KEEPING IN MIND.

00:34:25.263 --> 00:34:26.998
I ALSO WANT TO OFFER A FEW

00:34:27.064 --> 00:34:28.266
PIECES OF INFORMATION FROM A

00:34:28.332 --> 00:34:29.967
RECENT STATEWIDE POLL THAT THE

00:34:30.034 --> 00:34:31.269
CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE FOUNDATION

00:34:31.335 --> 00:34:33.905
IN THE KAISER FAMILY FOUNDATION --

00:34:33.971 --> 00:34:35.907
PUBLISHED IN JANUARY WHEN PEOPLE

00:34:35.973 --> 00:34:37.975
WERE ASKED WHAT DO YOU MOST WANT

00:34:38.042 --> 00:34:40.144
THE NEW GOVERNOR AND LEGISLATURE

00:34:40.211 --> 00:34:41.479
TO WORK ON WHEN IT COMES TO

00:34:41.546 --> 00:34:42.447
HEALTHCARE.

00:34:42.513 --> 00:34:44.749
THE TOP RESPONSE WAS MAKING SURE

00:34:44.816 --> 00:34:46.617
PEOPLE WITH MENTAL HEALTH

00:34:46.684 --> 00:34:47.852
PROBLEMS CAN GET TREATMENT.

00:34:47.919 --> 00:34:49.587
SO I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE

00:34:49.654 --> 00:34:51.022
COMMITTEES FOR HOLDING THESE

00:34:51.088 --> 00:34:54.192
IMPORTANT HEARINGS AT THIS TIME.

00:34:54.258 --> 00:34:54.926
AS FAR AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE

00:34:54.992 --> 00:34:55.760
SIDE I'M GOING TO TALK FIRST

00:34:55.827 --> 00:34:56.594
ABOUT PREVALENCE THAN ABOUT

00:34:56.661 --> 00:34:58.229
ACCESS TO CARE AND A LITTLE BIT

00:34:58.296 --> 00:35:01.999
ABOUT MEDI CAL.

00:35:02.066 --> 00:35:04.435
IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ONE IN TWENTY

00:35:04.502 --> 00:35:05.603
FOUR ADULTS IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S

00:35:05.670 --> 00:35:07.138
ABOUT 4% OF ALL ADULTS

00:35:07.205 --> 00:35:08.773
EXPERIENCED A SERIOUS MENTAL

00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.807
ILLNESS.

00:35:09.874 --> 00:35:11.375
THAT'S DEFINED IS A DIAGNOSABLE

00:35:11.442 --> 00:35:13.544
MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR EMOTIONAL

00:35:13.611 --> 00:35:15.246
DISORDER RESULTING IN FUNCTIONAL

00:35:15.313 --> 00:35:16.647
IMPAIRMENT THAT INTERFERES WITH

00:35:16.714 --> 00:35:19.350
OUR LIMITS MAJOR LIFE ACTIVITIES.

00:35:19.417 --> 00:35:21.252
A MUCH LARGER PERCENTAGE ABOUT

00:35:21.319 --> 00:35:23.554
ONE IN SIX OR 15% OF THE

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:24.789
CALIFORNIA DEL POPULATION

00:35:24.856 --> 00:35:26.724
EXPERIENCED ANY MENTAL ILLNESS

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:27.758
AGAIN.

00:35:27.825 --> 00:35:28.960
THEY HAVE A MENTAL BEHAVIORAL OR

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:30.661
EMOTIONAL DISORDER THE

00:35:30.728 --> 00:35:31.195
REGARDLESS OF THE LEVEL OF

00:35:31.262 --> 00:35:32.997
IMPAIRMENT.

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.065
AMONG CHILDREN THOSE WITH THE

00:35:34.131 --> 00:35:36.868
GREEN FIGURES. ONE IN THIRTEEN

00:35:36.934 --> 00:35:38.202
MORE THAN 7% HAD A SERIOUS

00:35:38.269 --> 00:35:39.470
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE THAT'S

00:35:39.537 --> 00:35:41.005
ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT OF THE

00:35:41.072 --> 00:35:43.074
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS DIAGNOSIS

00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:44.175
FOR ADULTS.

00:35:44.242 --> 00:35:45.676
THERE IS NOT AN EQUIVALENT ANY

00:35:45.743 --> 00:35:46.978
MENTAL ILLNESS --

00:35:47.044 --> 00:35:49.046
CATEGORIZATION FOR CHILDREN SO

00:35:49.113 --> 00:35:50.848
THIS IS THE DATA THAT WE HAVE.

00:35:50.915 --> 00:35:51.782
FOR THE MOST PART AND YOU'LL

00:35:51.849 --> 00:35:53.885
HEAR ME SAY THIS A FEW MORE TO

00:35:53.951 --> 00:35:56.487
OVERALL ESTIMATES ARE NOT.

00:35:56.554 --> 00:35:57.922
ARE NOT REALLY AT ALL CHANGED

00:35:57.989 --> 00:35:59.090
FROM THE LAST TIME THAT THE

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:00.491
CALIFORNIA FOUND CARE HEALTHCARE

00:36:00.558 --> 00:36:01.726
FOUNDATION RAN THE STATE A WHICH

00:36:01.792 --> 00:36:03.327
WAS BASED ON TWO THOUSAND NINE

00:36:03.394 --> 00:36:05.096
DATA SO OVERALL WE ARE SEEING.

00:36:05.162 --> 00:36:06.597
CONSISTENT LEVELS OF PREVALENCE

00:36:06.664 --> 00:36:07.865
WHICH IS WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT

00:36:07.932 --> 00:36:10.434
FROM MAJOR CHRONIC ILLNESSES.

00:36:10.501 --> 00:36:12.103
HOWEVER THE RATES DO VERY ACROSS

00:36:12.169 --> 00:36:13.704
THE STATE IN A COUPLE OF WAYS

00:36:13.771 --> 00:36:15.740
FIRST BY REGION THE RATE OF

00:36:15.806 --> 00:36:17.375
SERIOUS EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE

00:36:17.441 --> 00:36:18.509
AMONG CHILDREN THOSE ARE THE

00:36:18.576 --> 00:36:19.577
GREEN BARS.

00:36:19.644 --> 00:36:20.745
VARIES FROM A HIGH OF EIGHT

00:36:20.811 --> 00:36:23.114
POINT 1% SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY DOWN

00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:25.216
TO A LOW OF SEVEN POINT 1% IN

00:36:25.283 --> 00:36:27.585
THE BAY AREA. FOR ADULTS THAT'S

00:36:27.652 --> 00:36:29.320
THE ORANGE BARS THERE'S A RANGE

00:36:29.387 --> 00:36:30.821
FROM ABOUT FIVE AND A HALF

00:36:30.888 --> 00:36:31.556
PERCENT IN THE NORTHERN IN

00:36:31.622 --> 00:36:32.990
SIERRA REGION DOWN TO THREE AND

00:36:33.057 --> 00:36:34.325
A HALF PERCENT IN THE GREATER

00:36:34.392 --> 00:36:35.993
BAY AREA SO THERE IS.

00:36:36.060 --> 00:36:37.695
A IT IS A DIFFERENCE IN FOR A

00:36:37.762 --> 00:36:39.063
QUICK NOTE FOR THE PURPOSES OF

00:36:39.130 --> 00:36:40.731
THIS REPORT NORTHERN AND SIERRA

00:36:40.798 --> 00:36:42.266
WHICH WILL COME BACK TO AGAIN IS

00:36:42.333 --> 00:36:43.334
ONE REGION.

00:36:43.401 --> 00:36:44.468
IT INCLUDES THE COUNTIES NORTH

00:36:44.535 --> 00:36:46.137
OF SACRAMENTO AS WELL AS THE

00:36:46.203 --> 00:36:47.438
EASTERN SIERRA COUNTIES DOWN TO

00:36:47.505 --> 00:36:49.373
THE INLAND EMPIRE.

00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:51.075
AND I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE SLIDE

00:36:51.142 --> 00:36:52.343
BUT AMONG ADULTS CALIFORNIA

00:36:52.410 --> 00:36:54.245
WOMEN WERE MORE LIKELY THAN MEN

00:36:54.312 --> 00:36:55.646
TO EXPERIENCE A SERIOUS MENTAL

00:36:55.713 --> 00:36:57.448
ILLNESS ABOUT FOUR POINT 8%

00:36:57.515 --> 00:36:59.383
VERSUS A THREE POINT 6% FOR MEN

00:36:59.450 --> 00:37:00.084
AND AGAIN.

00:37:00.151 --> 00:37:02.053
THESE RATES ARE LARGELY

00:37:02.119 --> 00:37:04.522
UNCHANGED SINCE.

00:37:04.589 --> 00:37:05.089
TWO THOUSAND NINE THIS SLIDE

00:37:05.156 --> 00:37:06.190
SHOWS VARIATION BY RACE AND

00:37:06.257 --> 00:37:07.525
ETHNICITY CHILDREN ON THE LEFT

00:37:07.592 --> 00:37:09.527
ADULTS ON THE RIGHT CHILDREN WE

00:37:09.594 --> 00:37:10.828
DON'T SEE A TREMENDOUS --

00:37:10.895 --> 00:37:12.730
DIFFERENCE BY RACE AND ETHNICITY

00:37:12.797 --> 00:37:14.599
THERE IS SOME WE SEE GREATER

00:37:14.665 --> 00:37:15.700
VARIABILITY IN THE RATES OF

00:37:15.766 --> 00:37:17.835
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN ADULTS

00:37:17.902 --> 00:37:19.403
BY RACE AND ETHNICITY WITH

00:37:19.470 --> 00:37:21.639
NATIVE AMERICAN AFRICAN AMERICAN

00:37:21.706 --> 00:37:23.240
AND MULTI RACIAL ADULTS.

00:37:23.307 --> 00:37:24.709
EXPERIENCING THE HIGHEST RATES

00:37:24.775 --> 00:37:26.243
ASIAN AND PACIFIC ISLANDERS WITH

00:37:26.310 --> 00:37:27.612
THE LOWEST RATES OF SERIOUS

00:37:27.678 --> 00:37:28.679
MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:37:28.746 --> 00:37:29.947
AND ONCE AGAIN WE SAW THE SAME

00:37:30.014 --> 00:37:32.049
DISCREPANCIES IN TWO THOUSAND

00:37:32.116 --> 00:37:35.786
NINE SO NOT MUCH CHANGE --

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:37.054
CHAIR WOULD MENTIONED PREVALENCE

00:37:37.121 --> 00:37:38.789
VARYING BY INCOME IT'S VERY TRUE

00:37:38.856 --> 00:37:39.890
WE DO SEE SIGNIFICANT

00:37:39.957 --> 00:37:41.192
DIFFERENCES WITH THE HIGHEST

00:37:41.258 --> 00:37:42.293
RATES OF THE LOWEST INCOME

00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.427
LEVELS.

00:37:43.494 --> 00:37:44.795
FOR CHILDREN THE GREEN BARS YOU

00:37:44.862 --> 00:37:46.631
CAN SEE THAT ONE IN TEN CHILDREN

00:37:46.697 --> 00:37:49.333
BELOW THE POVERTY LEVEL SUFFERED

00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:49.834
FROM A SERIOUS EMOTIONAL

00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.168
DISTURBANCE.

00:37:51.235 --> 00:37:52.370
THE ORANGE BARS SHOW ALMOST AS

00:37:52.436 --> 00:37:55.439
MANY ADULTS ABOUT 9% OF PEOPLE

00:37:55.506 --> 00:37:56.440
BELOW A 100% OF THE FEDERAL

00:37:56.507 --> 00:37:57.775
POVERTY LEVEL EXPERIENCING

00:37:57.842 --> 00:38:03.814
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:38:03.881 --> 00:38:04.882
I'VE SAID THE PREVALENCE RATES

00:38:04.949 --> 00:38:06.183
OVERALL ARE UNCHANGED I WANT TO

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.151
SHOW YOU ONE EXCEPTION.

00:38:07.218 --> 00:38:08.519
THE RATES OF MAJOR DEPRESSIVE

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:10.554
EPISODES IN ADOLESCENTS HAVE

00:38:10.621 --> 00:38:13.591
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY IN

00:38:13.658 --> 00:38:15.192
200-082-0009 EIGHT ABOUT EIGHT

00:38:15.259 --> 00:38:17.261
POINT 2% OF TEENS REPORTED

00:38:17.328 --> 00:38:18.996
EXPERIENCING A MAJOR DEPRESSIVE

00:38:19.063 --> 00:38:20.197
EPISODE IN THIS I WANT TO BE

00:38:20.264 --> 00:38:21.332
CLEAR IS NOT.

00:38:21.399 --> 00:38:22.366
THE NORMAL ADJUSTMENTS OF

00:38:22.433 --> 00:38:25.102
ADOLESCENCE AND MOODINESS

00:38:25.169 --> 00:38:25.970
ILLNESS --

00:38:26.037 --> 00:38:28.506
BUT AS YOU CAN SEE IN TWENTY

00:38:28.572 --> 00:38:29.073
FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT

00:38:29.140 --> 00:38:29.974
RATE IS UP TO TWELVE AND A HALF

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:32.176
PERCENT SO SORRY TWELVE POINT 3%

00:38:32.243 --> 00:38:33.244
IN CALIFORNIA.

00:38:33.310 --> 00:38:35.212
OF ONE IN EIGHT ADOLESCENCE

00:38:35.279 --> 00:38:37.682
WHICH IS A 50% INCREASE OVER

00:38:37.748 --> 00:38:38.983
THAT SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.

00:38:39.050 --> 00:38:39.817
WE'VE SEEN THESE NUMBERS

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:42.553
INCREASING NATIONALLY AS WELL --

00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.288
AND IT'S OBVIOUSLY A SERIOUS

00:38:44.355 --> 00:38:46.023
AREA OF CONCERN I SHOULD POINT

00:38:46.090 --> 00:38:46.824
OUT THAT THIS IS FROM A

00:38:46.891 --> 00:38:48.259
DIFFERENT SOURCE THAN THE OTHER

00:38:48.325 --> 00:38:49.560
PREVALENT SLIDE SO THEY MAY NOT

00:38:49.627 --> 00:38:52.463
BE DIRECTLY COMPARABLE THIS IS

00:38:52.530 --> 00:38:55.099
FROM SAMPSON REPORTING.

00:38:55.166 --> 00:38:55.833
ALTHOUGH OUR HEARING TODAY'S

00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.201
FOCUSED ON MENTAL HEALTH WE ARE

00:38:57.268 --> 00:38:58.235
I THINK ALL AWARE THAT VERY

00:38:58.302 --> 00:38:59.637
FREQUENTLY PEOPLE WITH MENTAL

00:38:59.704 --> 00:39:00.938
ILLNESS HAVE CO OCCURRING

00:39:01.005 --> 00:39:02.540
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER.

00:39:02.606 --> 00:39:03.741
AND THAT'S WHAT'S REPRESENTED

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.142
HERE ON THE SLIDE THESE

00:39:05.209 --> 00:39:06.210
STATISTICS SHOW THAT ABOUT A

00:39:06.277 --> 00:39:08.279
THIRD OF ADULTS WITH SERIOUS

00:39:08.345 --> 00:39:09.513
MENTAL ILLNESS ALSO HAVE A

00:39:09.580 --> 00:39:12.183
DIAGNOSED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER.

00:39:12.249 --> 00:39:13.484
FOR YOUTH THAT NUMBER IS ABOUT

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:19.724
10%.

00:39:19.790 --> 00:39:21.659
MOST PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL

00:39:21.726 --> 00:39:23.260
ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE

00:39:23.327 --> 00:39:24.829
DISORDER ARE NOT SUICIDAL.

00:39:24.895 --> 00:39:26.464
BUT MOST PEOPLE WHO DIE BY

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.466
SUICIDE DO HAVE A MENTAL OR

00:39:28.532 --> 00:39:31.068
EMOTIONAL DISORDER AN ESTIMATED

00:39:31.135 --> 00:39:32.403
THIRTY TO UP 270% EXPERIENCE

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.839
DEPRESSION OR BIPOLAR ILLNESS.

00:39:34.905 --> 00:39:36.507
AND ON THE SUBSTANCE USE

00:39:36.574 --> 00:39:37.641
DISORDER SIDE PEOPLE SUBSTANCE

00:39:37.708 --> 00:39:39.243
USE DISORDER ABOUT SIX TIMES

00:39:39.310 --> 00:39:40.978
MORE LIKELY TO COMMIT SUICIDE

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:41.779
THAN THOSE WITHOUT.

00:39:41.846 --> 00:39:43.814
SO SUICIDE STATISTICS ARE QUITE

00:39:43.881 --> 00:39:45.649
RELEVANT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

00:39:45.716 --> 00:39:46.617
MENTAL HEALTH IN CALIFORNIA

00:39:46.684 --> 00:39:47.651
ALTHOUGH THEY REPRESENT

00:39:47.718 --> 00:39:49.653
OBVIOUSLY THE EXTREME EDGE SORT

00:39:49.720 --> 00:39:51.188
OF THE TIP OF THE ICEBERG.

00:39:51.255 --> 00:39:52.723
CALIFORNIA SUICIDE RATE WHICH IS

00:39:52.790 --> 00:39:55.192
BETWEEN TEN AND ELEVEN PER ONE

00:39:55.259 --> 00:39:55.826
HUNDRED THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN

00:39:55.893 --> 00:39:57.428
THE STATE HAS BEEN STABLE FOR A

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.629
LONG TIME THE NUMBERS DON'T

00:39:58.696 --> 00:39:59.797
CHANGE MUCH.

00:39:59.864 --> 00:40:01.031
IT'S LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:01.866
RATE --

00:40:01.932 --> 00:40:03.267
WHICH IS NOT SHOWN HERE.

00:40:03.334 --> 00:40:04.769
BUT YOU CAN SEE THE RATES ARE

00:40:04.835 --> 00:40:06.070
NOT EVENLY DISTRIBUTED IN

00:40:06.137 --> 00:40:07.438
PARTICULAR ON THE VERY

00:40:07.505 --> 00:40:10.207
CONSIDERABLY BY REGION LA COUNTY

00:40:10.274 --> 00:40:14.478
HAS THE LOWEST RATE AT SEVEN PER

00:40:14.545 --> 00:40:15.079
HUNDRED THOUSAND THE NORTHERN

00:40:15.146 --> 00:40:16.514
SIERRA REGION IS THREE TIMES AS

00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:17.548
HIGH AND DOUBLE THE STATE

00:40:17.615 --> 00:40:20.718
AVERAGE.

00:40:20.785 --> 00:40:22.186
SUICIDE RATES ALSO VERY BY

00:40:22.253 --> 00:40:23.120
GENDER.

00:40:23.187 --> 00:40:24.388
AND BY RACE AND RACE AND

00:40:24.455 --> 00:40:25.523
ETHNICITY.

00:40:25.589 --> 00:40:28.092
MALES HAVE THREE TIMES THE RATE

00:40:28.159 --> 00:40:29.927
OF SUICIDE OF WOMEN ALTHOUGH IT

00:40:29.994 --> 00:40:30.694
THIS ISN'T ON THE SLIDE AMONG

00:40:30.761 --> 00:40:32.329
HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS YOU SEE

00:40:32.396 --> 00:40:33.230
MUCH HIGHER RATES --

00:40:33.297 --> 00:40:34.732
SELF REPORTED ATTEMPTS OF

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.901
SUICIDE ARE MUCH ARE TWICE AS

00:40:36.967 --> 00:40:38.736
HIGH AMONG GIRLS AS AMONG BOYS --

00:40:38.803 --> 00:40:40.504
RATES OF SUICIDE ARE HIGHEST BY

00:40:40.571 --> 00:40:43.340
ETHNICITY FOR NATIVE AMERICAN

00:40:43.407 --> 00:40:45.910
AND WHITE GROUPS.

00:40:45.976 --> 00:40:46.811
THAT'S OF THOUGH THERE'S THE

00:40:46.877 --> 00:40:49.647
BLUE BARS ON THE SLIDE.

00:40:49.713 --> 00:40:51.982
I'M NOT GONNA SHIFTED TO TALK TO

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:52.716
A TOPIC I KNOW IS OF UTMOST

00:40:52.783 --> 00:40:53.684
INTEREST EVERYONE HERE WHICH IS

00:40:53.751 --> 00:40:55.119
ACCESS TO CARE FOR MENTAL

00:40:55.186 --> 00:40:56.120
ILLNESS.

00:40:56.187 --> 00:40:58.689
AND I WILL SAY THAT THE NUMBERS

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.291
ARE NOT GREAT --

00:41:00.357 --> 00:41:01.926
THIS SLIDE SHOWS THE JUST OVER A

00:41:01.992 --> 00:41:03.794
THIRD OF CALIFORNIAN AND ADULTS

00:41:03.861 --> 00:41:05.729
WITH A MENTAL ILLNESS RECEIVED

00:41:05.796 --> 00:41:06.997
TREATMENT OR COUNSELING DURING

00:41:07.064 --> 00:41:08.499
THE PRIOR YEAR.

00:41:08.566 --> 00:41:10.334
AND THIS IS A COMPETENT OF DATA

00:41:10.401 --> 00:41:12.403
FROM TWENTY ELEVEN TO TWENTY

00:41:12.469 --> 00:41:13.003
FIFTEEN SO IT'S NOT A SINGLE

00:41:13.070 --> 00:41:15.306
YEAR BUT REPORTING BACK IS A

00:41:15.372 --> 00:41:16.073
SELF REPORT BASED ON THE PAST

00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:16.974
YEAR.

00:41:17.041 --> 00:41:18.475
THIS IS LOWER THAN THE NATIONAL

00:41:18.542 --> 00:41:21.178
RATE WHICH IS ABOUT 43% AND

00:41:21.245 --> 00:41:25.149
AGAIN IS THE SAME AS IT WAS IN.

00:41:25.216 --> 00:41:25.616
TWO THOUSAND NINE THIS

00:41:25.683 --> 00:41:27.351
DIFFICULTY IN ACCESSING CARE WAS

00:41:27.418 --> 00:41:28.853
ALSO REFLECTED IN THE POLL

00:41:28.919 --> 00:41:30.654
RESULTS I MENTIONED EARLIER

00:41:30.721 --> 00:41:32.556
WHICH FOUND THAT ABOUT HALF OF

00:41:32.623 --> 00:41:34.625
CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THAT QUOTE.

00:41:34.692 --> 00:41:36.360
MOST CALIFORNIANS WHO NEED

00:41:36.427 --> 00:41:37.728
MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE YOU

00:41:37.795 --> 00:41:39.196
SERVICES ARE NOT ABLE TO GET

00:41:39.263 --> 00:41:39.930
THEM.

00:41:39.997 --> 00:41:40.965
AND ONE THING WE FOUND IN THAT

00:41:41.031 --> 00:41:43.234
POLL WAS THAT OF HE REPORTED%

00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:44.635
THAT THEY WENT OUT TO TRY AND

00:41:44.702 --> 00:41:45.703
SEEK TREATMENT.

00:41:45.769 --> 00:41:47.304
THEY WERE EVEN MORE LIKELY TO

00:41:47.371 --> 00:41:48.672
SAY THAT IT'S HARD TO GET SO

00:41:48.739 --> 00:41:50.341
THIS IS A PERCEPTION --

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:51.442
IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND

00:41:51.508 --> 00:41:52.476
IT'S BORNE OUT BY PEOPLE'S

00:41:52.543 --> 00:41:54.378
ACTUAL EXPERIENCE.

00:41:54.445 --> 00:41:55.646
I DIDN'T INCLUDE THE SLIDE BUT

00:41:55.713 --> 00:41:56.881
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE I WILL SAY

00:41:56.947 --> 00:41:58.682
THAT FOR ADULTS WITH MAJOR

00:41:58.749 --> 00:42:00.317
DEPRESSION AGAIN THIS SLIDE IS

00:42:00.384 --> 00:42:01.118
FOR PEOPLE WITH ANY MENTAL

00:42:01.185 --> 00:42:01.785
ILLNESS.

00:42:01.852 --> 00:42:03.454
BUT FOR PEOPLE WITH MAJOR

00:42:03.520 --> 00:42:05.055
DEPRESSION ADULTS THE NUMBERS

00:42:05.122 --> 00:42:06.090
ARE REVERSED AND ABOUT TWO

00:42:06.156 --> 00:42:07.892
THIRDS OF PEOPLE DO REPORT

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:09.526
GETTING TREATMENT SO THAT'S GOOD --

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:10.728
AS YOU KNOW DEPRESSION IS ONE OF

00:42:10.794 --> 00:42:11.896
THE MOST COMMON FORMS OF MENTAL

00:42:11.962 --> 00:42:13.330
ILLNESS AND STRONGLY ASSOCIATED

00:42:13.397 --> 00:42:15.666
NOT ONLY WITH SUICIDE BUT ALSO

00:42:15.733 --> 00:42:19.670
WITH CARDIOVASCULAR DEATH --

00:42:19.737 --> 00:42:21.839
LESS PROMISING THOUGH WE SEE --

00:42:21.906 --> 00:42:23.340
THE SAME NUMBERS THESE ARE FOR

00:42:23.407 --> 00:42:24.241
ADOLESCENTS SO I MENTIONED

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:26.010
EARLIER HAVE THIS INCREASED RATE

00:42:26.076 --> 00:42:26.810
OF MAJOR DEPRESSION AS WE'VE

00:42:26.877 --> 00:42:27.544
SEEN.

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:30.180
AND ONLY ONE THIRD OF THOSE

00:42:30.247 --> 00:42:31.282
CALIFORNIA ADOLESCENTS WHO

00:42:31.348 --> 00:42:32.616
REPORTED SYMPTOMS OF MAJOR

00:42:32.683 --> 00:42:34.718
DEPRESSIVE EPISODES DURING THE

00:42:34.785 --> 00:42:36.620
PAST YEAR HAD RECEIVED TREATMENT --

00:42:36.687 --> 00:42:37.988
AND THAT IT CAN IS LOWER THAN

00:42:38.055 --> 00:42:39.657
THE NATIONAL RATE WHERE STILL

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:42.726
LOW BUT IT'S CLOSER 240% THAN

00:42:42.793 --> 00:42:47.765
THE 32% WE SEE HERE.

00:42:47.831 --> 00:42:48.732
MYCO PRESENTERS ARE GOING TO

00:42:48.799 --> 00:42:49.633
SAY A WHOLE LOT MORE AND A LOT

00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:50.234
MORE DETAIL ABOUT OUR PUBLIC

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:51.802
SYSTEMS OF CARE BUT I WANTED TO

00:42:51.869 --> 00:42:53.504
GET A FEW POINTS IN.

00:42:53.570 --> 00:42:55.773
THE FIRST IS THE RELATIVE SIZE

00:42:55.839 --> 00:42:57.374
OF THE ALL HEALTH BUDGET.

00:42:57.441 --> 00:42:59.310
AND THE MENTAL HEALTH BUDGETS NO

00:42:59.376 --> 00:43:01.145
THESE ARE U. S. THIS IS U. S.

00:43:01.211 --> 00:43:02.179
STATUS OF THIS IS REALLY AT A

00:43:02.246 --> 00:43:03.814
HIGH LEVEL WE DON'T HAVE SIMILAR

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:05.182
DATA FOR CALIFORNIA.

00:43:05.249 --> 00:43:06.450
BUT I FIRST WANTED TO POINT OUT

00:43:06.517 --> 00:43:08.085
THE RELATIVE SIZE OF THE SPEND

00:43:08.152 --> 00:43:08.886
HERE.

00:43:08.953 --> 00:43:09.954
TOTAL U. S. MENTAL HEALTH

00:43:10.020 --> 00:43:12.690
EXPENDITURES THIS IS FOR TWENTY

00:43:12.756 --> 00:43:13.257
FIFTEEN WERE PROJECTED TO BE

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:14.725
ABOUT A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SIX

00:43:14.792 --> 00:43:17.061
BILLION DOLLARS THAT 6% OF THE

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.729
TOTAL HEALTHCARE EXPENDITURES

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:20.831
FOR THE NATION SO --

00:43:20.898 --> 00:43:23.534
I TRIED TO MAKE THE SLIDE WITH

00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.501
AS BUT THEN YOU COULDN'T READ

00:43:24.568 --> 00:43:25.269
THE LITTLE ONE SO THEY'RE THE

00:43:25.336 --> 00:43:27.271
SAME SIZE BUT REALLY ONE IS

00:43:27.338 --> 00:43:28.973
REALLY 6% OF THE OTHER.

00:43:29.039 --> 00:43:30.574
THE SECOND POINT IS THAT MUCH

00:43:30.641 --> 00:43:31.508
MORE THAN OTHER KINDS OF HEALTH

00:43:31.575 --> 00:43:33.077
CARE SERVICES MENTAL HEALTH CARE

00:43:33.143 --> 00:43:34.945
SERVICES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH

00:43:35.012 --> 00:43:36.680
PUBLIC PROGRAMS --

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:38.315
IN THE CIRCLE ON THE RIGHT YOU

00:43:38.382 --> 00:43:39.917
CAN SEE THAT MEDICAID AND SO

00:43:39.984 --> 00:43:41.285
CALLED OTHER PUBLIC PROGRAMS

00:43:41.352 --> 00:43:42.086
THAT WOULD INCLUDE FEDERAL

00:43:42.152 --> 00:43:43.387
GRANTS --

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:45.089
ANOTHER FUNDING SOURCES.

00:43:45.155 --> 00:43:46.156
ARE PROJECT WERE PROJECTED TO

00:43:46.223 --> 00:43:47.424
PLAY IT PAID FOR SLIGHTLY MORE

00:43:47.491 --> 00:43:49.059
THAN HALF OF MENTAL HEALTH

00:43:49.126 --> 00:43:52.463
EXPENDITURES AGAIN THIS WAS --

00:43:52.529 --> 00:43:53.063
FOR TWENTY FIFTEEN AND THAT'S

00:43:53.130 --> 00:43:54.298
VERY DIFFERENT FROM WHAT WE SEE

00:43:54.365 --> 00:43:56.066
ON THE OVERALL HEALTH CARE SIDE

00:43:56.133 --> 00:43:57.801
SO -- THIS

00:43:57.868 --> 00:43:59.603
IS A PUBLIC SYSTEM MORE THAN OUR

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:01.839
OTHER HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS EVEN

00:44:01.905 --> 00:44:02.439
MORE THAN OUR OTHER HEALTHCARE

00:44:02.506 --> 00:44:03.273
SYSTEMS.

00:44:03.340 --> 00:44:04.808
AND THIS IS AGAIN A VERY HIGH

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:06.877
LEVEL SLIDE SHOWING THE GROWTH

00:44:06.944 --> 00:44:07.778
IN THE NUMBER OF MEDI CAL

00:44:07.845 --> 00:44:09.680
ENROLLEES WHO ARE SERVED BY THE

00:44:09.747 --> 00:44:11.248
SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM.

00:44:11.315 --> 00:44:12.916
IN MEDI CAL WHICH AS YOU ALL

00:44:12.983 --> 00:44:14.585
KNOW IS RUN BY THE COUNTIES NO

00:44:14.651 --> 00:44:16.186
HERE MUCH MORE ABOUT IN A BIT.

00:44:16.253 --> 00:44:17.955
WELL JUST A FEW YEARS AGO --

00:44:18.022 --> 00:44:19.156
THE ON THE BAR TO THE LEFT OF

00:44:19.223 --> 00:44:20.858
THAT SYSTEM WAS FAIRLY EVENLY

00:44:20.924 --> 00:44:22.292
SPLIT SPLIT BETWEEN CHILDREN AND

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:24.495
ADULTS WITH MEDI CAL EXPANSION

00:44:24.561 --> 00:44:25.696
THE NUMBER OF ADULTS BEING

00:44:25.763 --> 00:44:27.064
SERVED HAS REALLY SOARED.

00:44:27.131 --> 00:44:28.565
SINCE TWENTY TWELVE THE NUMBER

00:44:28.632 --> 00:44:29.700
OF CHILDREN IS INCREASED BY

00:44:29.767 --> 00:44:31.535
ABOUT 17% ADULT NUMBERS HAVE

00:44:31.602 --> 00:44:33.737
INCREASED ALMOST 50%.

00:44:33.804 --> 00:44:35.005
NOW MANY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

00:44:35.072 --> 00:44:36.306
MIGHT HAVE BEEN SERVED ALREADY

00:44:36.373 --> 00:44:37.441
THROUGH OTHER MENTAL HEALTH

00:44:37.508 --> 00:44:38.709
FUNDING SOURCES.

00:44:38.776 --> 00:44:40.077
BUT THEY'RE NOW ELIGIBLE FOR

00:44:40.144 --> 00:44:41.979
MEDI CAL AND ALL OF ITS BENEFITS

00:44:42.046 --> 00:44:43.113
AND THE SHIFT MEANS --

00:44:43.180 --> 00:44:44.181
THAT THEY HAVE ACCESS TO

00:44:44.248 --> 00:44:47.117
PHYSICAL HEALTH CARE SIR I HAVE

00:44:47.184 --> 00:44:49.453
HAD ACCESS TO BEFORE EITHER.

00:44:49.520 --> 00:44:53.457
THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:44:53.524 --> 00:44:54.825
A FUNDAMENTAL.

00:44:54.892 --> 00:44:56.894
TREMENDOUS DISPARITY IN HOW LONG

00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.162
PEOPLE WITH SERIOUS MENTAL

00:44:58.228 --> 00:44:59.863
ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE

00:44:59.930 --> 00:45:01.465
DISORDER AS WELL.

00:45:01.532 --> 00:45:03.767
LIVE IN THE SOCIETY AGAIN THESE

00:45:03.834 --> 00:45:05.069
ARE NATIONAL NOT CALIFORNIA

00:45:05.135 --> 00:45:07.404
STATISTICS BUT AS YOU CAN SEE

00:45:07.471 --> 00:45:08.806
AMERICANS WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL

00:45:08.872 --> 00:45:10.874
ILLNESS DIE TWENTY FIVE YEARS

00:45:10.941 --> 00:45:12.142
EARLIER THAN PEOPLE WITHOUT.

00:45:12.209 --> 00:45:13.610
THE NUMBER FOR SUBSTANCE USE

00:45:13.677 --> 00:45:15.012
DISORDER ACTUALLY SORRY IT'S A

00:45:15.079 --> 00:45:17.247
DUBBED DRUG DEPENDENCE DIAGNOSIS

00:45:17.314 --> 00:45:18.449
IS ACTUALLY HOW THAT STUDY WAS

00:45:18.515 --> 00:45:19.817
DONE -- DIED

00:45:19.883 --> 00:45:21.185
ALMOST TWENTY THREE YEARS

00:45:21.251 --> 00:45:23.387
EARLIER AND IMPORTANT TO NOTE

00:45:23.454 --> 00:45:24.555
THAT FOR THE MOST PART PEOPLE

00:45:24.621 --> 00:45:27.191
ARE DYING NOT OF OVERDOSES OR

00:45:27.257 --> 00:45:29.193
SUICIDE OR ACCIDENTS BUT RATHER

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:30.894
THE SAME THINGS AS THE REST OF

00:45:30.961 --> 00:45:31.962
THE POPULATION ONLY A LOT

00:45:32.029 --> 00:45:33.263
YOUNGER HEART DISEASE.

00:45:33.330 --> 00:45:35.466
STROKE DIABETES AND RESPIRATORY

00:45:35.532 --> 00:45:37.067
PROBLEMS SO ONE THING THAT WILL

00:45:37.134 --> 00:45:38.535
BE CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I THINK

00:45:38.602 --> 00:45:40.270
IN LOOKING AT THE SYSTEM IS HOW

00:45:40.337 --> 00:45:41.205
PEOPLE CAN RECEIVE BETTER

00:45:41.271 --> 00:45:43.207
INTEGRATED CARE PHYSICAL HEALTH

00:45:43.273 --> 00:45:45.275
CARE MENTAL HEALTH CARE

00:45:45.342 --> 00:45:48.378
SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES.

00:45:48.445 --> 00:45:49.513
WE SEE THESE DISPARITIES IN

00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:51.682
HEALTH OUTCOMES REFLECTED IN OUR

00:45:51.748 --> 00:45:53.083
SPENDING THIS IS BACK TO MEN

00:45:53.150 --> 00:45:57.020
MEDI CAL DATA THIS IS FROM --

00:45:57.087 --> 00:45:58.155
TWENTY ELEVEN YOU CAN SEE THE

00:45:58.222 --> 00:46:00.724
TOTAL COSTS OF CARE FOR A PERSON

00:46:00.791 --> 00:46:03.227
WITH DIABETES ALONE IS SORT OF

00:46:03.293 --> 00:46:04.695
ON THE IS ON THE LEFT HAND BAR.

00:46:04.761 --> 00:46:05.996
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE MIDDLE BAR

00:46:06.063 --> 00:46:07.364
THAT SOMEONE WHO HAS DIABETES

00:46:07.431 --> 00:46:09.066
AND ALSO HAS SERIOUS MENTAL

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.667
ILLNESSES AND THE COSTS ARE

00:46:10.734 --> 00:46:12.136
TWICE AS HIGH MORE THAN DOUBLE

00:46:12.202 --> 00:46:13.437
AND FINALLY THE BAR ON THE RIGHT

00:46:13.504 --> 00:46:15.472
HAND SIDE IS A PERSON WHO HAS

00:46:15.539 --> 00:46:17.141
DIABETES AND IS ALSO?

00:46:17.207 --> 00:46:18.342
A HAS SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS

00:46:18.408 --> 00:46:19.610
DIAGNOSIS AND AN S. U. D.

00:46:19.676 --> 00:46:21.578
DIAGNOSIS AND AGAIN THE COST UP

00:46:21.645 --> 00:46:22.980
TO TWO AND A HALF TIMES AS HIGH.

00:46:23.046 --> 00:46:24.982
WHAT I WOULD NOTE HERE IS THAT

00:46:25.048 --> 00:46:26.517
THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE

00:46:26.583 --> 00:46:28.085
THERE IS IN THAT YELLOW BAR

00:46:28.152 --> 00:46:30.454
WHICH IS OTHER MEDICAL CARE IT'S

00:46:30.521 --> 00:46:31.155
NOT?

00:46:31.221 --> 00:46:32.956
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WHICH IS

00:46:33.023 --> 00:46:34.158
JUST A LITTLE BAR BLUE BAR AT

00:46:34.224 --> 00:46:35.058
THE TOP IT'S IN THE

00:46:35.125 --> 00:46:36.193
PRESCRIPTIONS AND ALSO IN THE

00:46:36.260 --> 00:46:37.561
OTHER MEDICAL CARE THAT WE SEE

00:46:37.628 --> 00:46:38.395
THE DIFFERENCE.

00:46:38.462 --> 00:46:40.998
SO AGAIN THIS SUGGESTS THE NEED

00:46:41.064 --> 00:46:42.633
TO LOOK AT HOW WE INTEGRATE CARE

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:44.535
WE ARE ACCRUING COSTS ON THE

00:46:44.601 --> 00:46:46.603
PHYSICAL HEALTH SIDE NOT JUST ON

00:46:46.670 --> 00:46:48.872
THE MENTAL HEALTH SIDE.

00:46:48.939 --> 00:46:50.140
IN CLOSING I REALLY WANT TO

00:46:50.207 --> 00:46:52.042
EMPHASIZE THAT WHILE THESE DATA

00:46:52.109 --> 00:46:54.444
AS A WHOLE DO SHOW CONTINUING

00:46:54.511 --> 00:46:55.979
GAPS IN ACCESS TO CARE.

00:46:56.046 --> 00:46:58.382
AND RISING RATES OF ILLNESS FOR

00:46:58.448 --> 00:47:00.851
SOME POPULATIONS WE KNOW THAT

00:47:00.918 --> 00:47:02.286
PEOPLE WITH SUBSTANCE USE

00:47:02.352 --> 00:47:03.954
DISORDER IN WITH MENTAL ILLNESS

00:47:04.021 --> 00:47:05.055
DO RECOVER.

00:47:05.122 --> 00:47:07.090
THEY WORK AND VOTE AND RAISE

00:47:07.157 --> 00:47:08.892
FAMILIES AND PARTICIPATE FULLY

00:47:08.959 --> 00:47:10.961
IN OUR SOCIETY AND PROVIDERS OF

00:47:11.028 --> 00:47:12.563
CARE ALL OVER THE STATE ARE

00:47:12.629 --> 00:47:13.964
WORKING TO PROVIDE AND ARRANGE

00:47:14.031 --> 00:47:15.566
TOP OF THE LINE CARE FOR PEOPLE

00:47:15.632 --> 00:47:17.100
WHO NEED IT.

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:18.335
AGAIN THE POLL RESULTS I THINK A

00:47:18.402 --> 00:47:20.904
REALLY INSTRUCTIVE HERE ABOUT

00:47:20.971 --> 00:47:23.006
75% OF CALIFORNIANS BELIEVE THE

00:47:23.073 --> 00:47:24.741
COUNSELING AND MEDICAL TREATMENT

00:47:24.808 --> 00:47:26.643
IS EFFECTIVE IN HELPING PEOPLE

00:47:26.710 --> 00:47:27.945
WITH MEDICAL CAN MENTAL HEALTH

00:47:28.011 --> 00:47:28.946
CONDITIONS.

00:47:29.012 --> 00:47:30.280
LEAD HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE

00:47:30.347 --> 00:47:31.448
LIVES.

00:47:31.515 --> 00:47:32.282
I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THOUGH

00:47:32.349 --> 00:47:35.586
THAT OUR SYSTEMS MAKE IT EASY

00:47:35.652 --> 00:47:36.453
FOR PEOPLE TO ACCESS ALL THE

00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.654
CARE THAT WE NEED AND THE

00:47:37.721 --> 00:47:39.323
CALIFORNIA CAN DO BETTER AND DO

00:47:39.389 --> 00:47:39.723
MORE.

00:47:39.790 --> 00:47:41.558
SO I THANK YOU FOR YOU TIME

00:47:41.625 --> 00:47:43.060
TODAY I'M HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

00:47:43.126 --> 00:47:44.861
QUESTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH

00:47:44.928 --> 00:47:46.396
APPRECIATE THAT INFORMATION IS

00:47:46.463 --> 00:47:47.331
SERVED WITH QUESTIONS FROM

00:47:47.397 --> 00:47:47.631
[inaudible]

00:47:47.698 --> 00:47:49.800
PANEL [inaudible]

00:47:49.866 --> 00:47:54.238
MISS WALDRON.

00:47:54.304 --> 00:47:56.707
THANK YOU I'M JUST BRIEFLY WHEN

00:47:56.773 --> 00:47:58.308
YOU WERE SHOWING THE YOU KNOW

00:47:58.375 --> 00:48:00.177
THE RATES OF MENTAL ILLNESS

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:02.846
BETWEEN ADULTS AND CHILDREN IT

00:48:02.913 --> 00:48:05.249
WAS KIND OF STARK IN LEE --

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:07.351
INTERESTING HOW HIGH THE RATES

00:48:07.417 --> 00:48:08.685
ARE IN THE CHILDREN THAT ARE OF

00:48:08.752 --> 00:48:09.886
OF COMING --

00:48:09.953 --> 00:48:11.855
DOES THAT INCLUDE THE SEPT

00:48:11.922 --> 00:48:13.323
FIGURE INCLUDE --

00:48:13.390 --> 00:48:15.626
AUTISM SPECTRUM AS WELL DESIGN

00:48:15.692 --> 00:48:17.227
INCLUDED IN THE MENTAL ILLNESS

00:48:17.294 --> 00:48:19.563
PORTION OR I SHOULD CHECK THAT

00:48:19.630 --> 00:48:20.797
TO BE ABSOLUTELY SURE I DON'T

00:48:20.864 --> 00:48:21.732
THINK IT DOES I THINK THAT

00:48:21.798 --> 00:48:23.500
DEFINITION DOES NOT INCLUDE

00:48:23.567 --> 00:48:24.935
AUTISM ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE

00:48:25.002 --> 00:48:27.204
SOME OVERLAP BUT I WILL CHECK

00:48:27.271 --> 00:48:28.872
AND GET BACK TO THEM.

00:48:28.939 --> 00:48:31.608
MINE I'M ARE THERE OTHER THAN I

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:32.943
ALSO -- I

00:48:33.010 --> 00:48:34.311
KNOW IN THE LAST YEAR SO WE'VE

00:48:34.378 --> 00:48:36.280
LOOKED INTO YOU KNOW THE

00:48:36.346 --> 00:48:38.448
ACQUIRED STRESS OF YOU KNOW

00:48:38.515 --> 00:48:41.018
CHILDREN NOW GROWING UP --

00:48:41.084 --> 00:48:44.288
FORGET THE ACRONYM THAT SEES

00:48:44.354 --> 00:48:48.058
FOUR ACES YES YEAH --

00:48:48.125 --> 00:48:49.192
I WOULD ASSUME.

00:48:49.259 --> 00:48:50.560
THAT THAT'S IN A ONE OF THE

00:48:50.627 --> 00:48:52.963
REASONS WHY I MEAN TO THE AS FAR

00:48:53.030 --> 00:48:55.132
AS THE THE DATA --

00:48:55.198 --> 00:48:56.700
HAVE THE BROKEN IT DOWN YOU KNOW

00:48:56.767 --> 00:48:58.001
TO MAYBE THAT'S WHY SOME OF THE

00:48:58.068 --> 00:48:59.369
REGIONS ARE THAT WAY I DON'T

00:48:59.436 --> 00:49:01.338
KNOW BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE SOME

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:03.473
OF THE URBAN CITIES ACTUALLY

00:49:03.540 --> 00:49:05.175
DOING BETTER THAN THE RURAL.

00:49:05.242 --> 00:49:08.445
YEAH THE DATA THAT WE HAVE --

00:49:08.512 --> 00:49:09.446
COME FROM SORT OF A GOOD A

00:49:09.513 --> 00:49:12.149
COMPLEX ANALYSIS DONE BY CHARLES

00:49:12.215 --> 00:49:13.784
HOLZER AND LONG NGUYEN IS THE

00:49:13.850 --> 00:49:14.618
SAME DATE OF ITS STATE IS USED

00:49:14.685 --> 00:49:16.553
IN THE PAST THEY DON'T ACTUALLY

00:49:16.620 --> 00:49:18.789
ALLOW FOR THAT KIND OF A

00:49:18.855 --> 00:49:21.258
RELATIONSHIP SO I HESITATE TO

00:49:21.325 --> 00:49:23.760
EXACTLY ON ON THE Y. FOR IT --

00:49:23.827 --> 00:49:24.561
BUT IT'S TRUE THERE IS

00:49:24.628 --> 00:49:26.830
SIGNIFICANT VARIATION --

00:49:26.897 --> 00:49:28.799
CERTAINLY BY INCOME AND I THINK

00:49:28.865 --> 00:49:29.232
THAT.

00:49:29.299 --> 00:49:31.268
IT'S NOT NOT A LOGICAL TO ASSUME

00:49:31.335 --> 00:49:34.538
THAT THAT'S IN SOME WAYS RELATED --

00:49:34.604 --> 00:49:35.906
TO TO THE STRESSES OF POVERTY.

00:49:35.972 --> 00:49:37.974
OKAY AND THEN JUST LAST REALLY

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:38.508
QUICKLY --

00:49:38.575 --> 00:49:39.543
BECAUSE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

00:49:39.609 --> 00:49:41.645
COSTS THE OVERALL COST OF THE

00:49:41.712 --> 00:49:43.580
THE PUBLIC YOU KNOW MONIES AND

00:49:43.647 --> 00:49:45.816
AND THE THE COST OF THE

00:49:45.882 --> 00:49:47.150
TREATMENT FOR MENTAL HEALTH.

00:49:47.217 --> 00:49:48.785
WE KNOW THAT THEY WOULD NEED TO

00:49:48.852 --> 00:49:50.287
BE THE WRAPAROUND SERVICES AND

00:49:50.354 --> 00:49:52.222
PEOPLE NEED TO STAY IN THEIR

00:49:52.289 --> 00:49:54.925
TREATMENTS --

00:49:54.991 --> 00:49:57.494
WOULD THE EXTRA COSTS LIKE.

00:49:57.561 --> 00:49:59.429
THE IT THE S. U. D. TREATMENTS

00:49:59.496 --> 00:50:01.164
OR ANYTHING TO DO WITH PHYSICAL

00:50:01.231 --> 00:50:04.034
HEALTH OR SOCIAL BESIDES THE

00:50:04.101 --> 00:50:05.602
PSYCHIATRIC MENTAL HEALTH WOULD

00:50:05.669 --> 00:50:08.205
THAT BE ADDITIONAL COSTS ON TOP.

00:50:08.271 --> 00:50:10.874
OF THE COSTS THAT WAS SHOWN OR

00:50:10.941 --> 00:50:12.642
IS THAT INCLUDED IN THAT.

00:50:12.709 --> 00:50:13.443
AS OF RIGHT IS THIS IN THE MEDI

00:50:13.510 --> 00:50:15.746
CAL DATA OR IN THAT GLOBAL DATA

00:50:15.812 --> 00:50:17.514
IN THE GLOBAL.

00:50:17.581 --> 00:50:18.815
THE GLOBAL DATA REALLY JUST

00:50:18.882 --> 00:50:20.817
BREAKS DOWN THE OVERALL HEALTH

00:50:20.884 --> 00:50:22.085
SPENDING AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:50:22.152 --> 00:50:24.121
SPENDING BY SOURCES BUT IT'S

00:50:24.187 --> 00:50:25.789
VERY HIGH LEVELS SO --

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.157
I THINK THERE'S I I DON'T

00:50:27.224 --> 00:50:29.192
CONSIDER TO BE EXTREMELY PRECISE

00:50:29.259 --> 00:50:31.161
BUT IT DOESN'T INCLUDE SUBSTANCE

00:50:31.228 --> 00:50:32.763
USE DISORDER TREATMENT.

00:50:32.829 --> 00:50:34.898
INFORMATION ON SO THAT WOULD BE.

00:50:34.965 --> 00:50:36.066
IF YOU ADDED THAT IN IT WOULD BE

00:50:36.133 --> 00:50:38.735
MORE THAN THE 6% OF HELL OVER OF

00:50:38.802 --> 00:50:39.870
OVERALL HEALTH CARE SPENDING

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:43.039
THANK YOU IT DOES HIGHLIGHT THE

00:50:43.106 --> 00:50:44.141
ENORMOUS --

00:50:44.207 --> 00:50:45.942
OBSTACLES THAT WE HAVE TO DEAL

00:50:46.009 --> 00:50:51.815
WITH IN THIS ISSUE SO THANK YOU

00:50:51.882 --> 00:50:52.115
[inaudible]

00:50:52.182 --> 00:50:55.419
SHE THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:56.987
FOR YOUR PRESENTATION --

00:50:57.053 --> 00:50:58.822
FEW QUESTIONS HAVE FIRST OF ALL

00:50:58.889 --> 00:51:00.490
IN TERMS OF WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE

00:51:00.557 --> 00:51:01.858
PREVALENCE DATA --

00:51:01.925 --> 00:51:03.627
FOR EXAMPLE YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:51:03.693 --> 00:51:07.164
ADULTS SPIED RECENT DATA SOURCE

00:51:07.230 --> 00:51:08.432
FOR US I HAVE A CHANCE TO GO

00:51:08.498 --> 00:51:09.466
BACK AND LOOK AT THE ORIGINAL

00:51:09.533 --> 00:51:11.935
SOURCE BUT FOR EXAMPLE WE KNOW

00:51:12.002 --> 00:51:13.403
THERE'S TREMENDOUS STIGMA --

00:51:13.470 --> 00:51:14.704
NON THE GENERAL POPULATION BUT

00:51:14.771 --> 00:51:16.306
FOR EXAMPLE THE API COMMUNITY SO

00:51:16.373 --> 00:51:18.608
I DON'T KNOW TO WHAT DEGREE THE

00:51:18.675 --> 00:51:21.478
LOW LEVEL OF ADULTS WITH MENTAL

00:51:21.545 --> 00:51:22.979
ILLNESS AND AMONG ASIANS AND

00:51:23.046 --> 00:51:24.414
PACIFIC ISLANDERS SO LOW IS THAT

00:51:24.481 --> 00:51:25.782
ACTUALLY REALITY OR IS THAT

00:51:25.849 --> 00:51:27.117
BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE

00:51:27.184 --> 00:51:29.319
REPORTING ARE NOT REPORTING --

00:51:29.386 --> 00:51:30.086
SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU CAN

00:51:30.153 --> 00:51:31.421
COMMENT ON THAT.

00:51:31.488 --> 00:51:32.656
YEAH I CAN COMMENT ON A TWO

00:51:32.722 --> 00:51:34.191
POINT OF OBVIOUSLY WE'VE HAD THE

00:51:34.257 --> 00:51:36.193
SAME QUESTION THE THAT I CAN

00:51:36.259 --> 00:51:37.427
SHARE WITH YOU --

00:51:37.494 --> 00:51:38.795
SEPARATELY A DETAILED

00:51:38.862 --> 00:51:40.664
DESCRIPTION OF THE OF THE

00:51:40.730 --> 00:51:42.499
METHODOLOGY FOR THESE --

00:51:42.566 --> 00:51:46.803
RATES THEY'RE BASED ON A SOCIO

00:51:46.870 --> 00:51:47.904
DEMOGRAPHIC RISK MODEL SO

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:48.839
THEY'RE NOT SELF REPORT OR

00:51:48.905 --> 00:51:51.241
SURVEY SO THEY PROBABLY DON'T

00:51:51.308 --> 00:51:52.742
LIKE THEY DON'T --

00:51:52.809 --> 00:51:54.010
THEY ARE AFFECTED.

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:55.645
BY IMMEDIATE STIGMA OF PEOPLE

00:51:55.712 --> 00:51:56.813
NOT DISCLOSING A SURVEY FOR

00:51:56.880 --> 00:51:58.381
INSTANCE.

00:51:58.448 --> 00:52:00.317
BUT I AM.

00:52:00.383 --> 00:52:01.785
I IMAGINE THEY ARE THEY THE

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:04.387
UNDERLYING MODEL IS BASED TO

00:52:04.454 --> 00:52:08.692
SOME YES SO --

00:52:08.758 --> 00:52:10.260
I DON'T WANT TO SPECULATE ON

00:52:10.327 --> 00:52:11.795
EXACTLY HOW THAT BY A SHOWS UP

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:13.964
BUT OKAY WE KNOW THAT WE KNOW

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.098
THAT STIGMA DOES AFFECT.

00:52:15.165 --> 00:52:17.100
IN GENERAL IS A CHALLENGE IN

00:52:17.167 --> 00:52:18.969
GETTING TRUE REPORTS BOTH IN

00:52:19.035 --> 00:52:20.537
SELF REPORTED DATA.

00:52:20.604 --> 00:52:22.405
AND IN --

00:52:22.472 --> 00:52:24.107
THESE DEMOGRAPHIC MORRIS WELL

00:52:24.174 --> 00:52:25.642
AND ALSO I MEAN IT'S NOTJUST

00:52:25.709 --> 00:52:28.144
SELF REPORT IT'S IF YOU'RE

00:52:28.211 --> 00:52:29.746
BASING ON ARE YOU SEEKING

00:52:29.813 --> 00:52:31.414
SERVICES.

00:52:31.481 --> 00:52:33.383
AND ALL THAT FACTORS IN RIGHT

00:52:33.450 --> 00:52:35.151
NOW.

00:52:35.218 --> 00:52:36.052
I KNOW THAT PEOPLE DON'T EVEN

00:52:36.119 --> 00:52:37.521
SEE SERVICES BECAUSE THEY DON'T

00:52:37.587 --> 00:52:40.123
WANT TO ADMIT THAT THAT'S GOING

00:52:40.190 --> 00:52:40.624
ON A FAMILY MEMBERS WILL

00:52:40.690 --> 00:52:41.925
PRESSURE THEM NOT --

00:52:41.992 --> 00:52:43.894
TO THE OTHER QUESTION I GUESS

00:52:43.960 --> 00:52:46.162
AND I KNOW THAT --

00:52:46.229 --> 00:52:47.430
SUMMER WALDRON BROUGHT THIS UP

00:52:47.497 --> 00:52:48.899
AND AND TERMS OF THIS TRANSITION

00:52:48.965 --> 00:52:50.600
FROM CHILDREN BEING AROUND 7%

00:52:50.667 --> 00:52:52.469
AND AND ADULTS --

00:52:52.536 --> 00:52:53.303
YEAH I'D BE INTERESTED IN

00:52:53.370 --> 00:52:55.438
KNOWING HOW MUCH --

00:52:55.505 --> 00:52:56.973
HOW MANY LIKE DEVELOPMENTAL

00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.309
ISSUES GET CAUGHT UP AT IN WHEN

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:00.877
YOU SAY BECAUSE --

00:53:00.944 --> 00:53:02.812
IN THAT DEFINITION ABOUT --

00:53:02.879 --> 00:53:05.015
THEIR EMOTIONAL --

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:08.485
BECAUSE WHAT WHAT'S THAT GETS UP

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:09.953
BECAUSE WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE --

00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:11.655
SOME OF THE MORE I GUESS WELL

00:53:11.721 --> 00:53:13.023
RECOGNIZED --

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.424
MENTAL HEALTH.

00:53:14.491 --> 00:53:16.426
ISSUES LIKE SCHIZOPHRENIA SO FOR

00:53:16.493 --> 00:53:19.796
ACTUALLY IN ADOLESCENCE SO WHEN

00:53:19.863 --> 00:53:21.298
4% THE QUESTION IS IS THAT

00:53:21.364 --> 00:53:22.599
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON IN THAT

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:24.200
TRADITION WHY IS WIRED ADULTS

00:53:24.267 --> 00:53:25.302
ACTUALLY LOWER THAN.

00:53:25.368 --> 00:53:26.670
KIDS WHEN WE ACTUALLY KNOW A LOT

00:53:26.736 --> 00:53:27.904
OF MENTAL ILLNESSES.

00:53:27.971 --> 00:53:29.639
ACTUALLY COME AND ADOLESCENCE OR

00:53:29.706 --> 00:53:31.675
YOUNG ADULTHOOD SO.

00:53:31.741 --> 00:53:33.276
THAT SEEMS LOW COUNTER INTUITIVE

00:53:33.343 --> 00:53:34.444
AND I THINK IT MAY HAVE TO DO

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:35.445
WITH DEFINITIONS.

00:53:35.512 --> 00:53:36.646
I THINK IT DOES HAVE TO DO WITH

00:53:36.713 --> 00:53:39.382
DEFINITIONS AND AND IS SERIOUS

00:53:39.449 --> 00:53:40.283
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE AND

00:53:40.350 --> 00:53:42.485
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS IN ADULTS

00:53:42.552 --> 00:53:43.520
ARE NOT THE SAME I MEAN THESE

00:53:43.587 --> 00:53:43.687
ARE.

00:53:43.753 --> 00:53:45.889
THESE ARE DIFFERENT DEFINITIONS --

00:53:45.956 --> 00:53:48.858
IN THE IN THE DSM --

00:53:48.925 --> 00:53:50.493
I WOULD OFFER A MINUTE.

00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.962
I I THINK MY COLLEAGUES FROM THE

00:53:52.028 --> 00:53:55.665
COUNTIES MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK --

00:53:55.732 --> 00:54:00.203
WELL TO HOW THAT TRANSIT I SEE A

00:54:00.270 --> 00:54:02.572
AND ADULTS BUT KNOW YOUR POINT

00:54:02.639 --> 00:54:03.807
IS WELL TAKEN OBVIOUSLY THAT.

00:54:03.873 --> 00:54:05.075
THERE ARE A LOT OF SERIOUS

00:54:05.141 --> 00:54:06.343
MENTAL ILLNESS DOES DEVELOP AS

00:54:06.409 --> 00:54:07.644
PEOPLE GET OLDER SO YOU WOULDN'T

00:54:07.711 --> 00:54:08.745
NECESSARILY.

00:54:08.812 --> 00:54:09.980
IF THE DEFINITIONS WERE THE SAME

00:54:10.046 --> 00:54:11.214
YOU WOULD NOT EXPECT TO SEE THAT

00:54:11.281 --> 00:54:13.116
DROP OFF BUT THEY ARE DIFFERENT

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:13.717
DEFINITIONS.

00:54:13.783 --> 00:54:14.451
FOR OKAY --

00:54:14.517 --> 00:54:16.086
THE OTHER QUESTION TERMS A

00:54:16.152 --> 00:54:18.655
SUICIDE RATES --

00:54:18.722 --> 00:54:20.890
I SEND IS THAT COMPLETED SUICIDE

00:54:20.957 --> 00:54:23.159
DIVERSES SUICIDALITY BECAUSE ONE

00:54:23.226 --> 00:54:24.494
COULD ARGUE THAT --

00:54:24.561 --> 00:54:25.595
FOR EXAMPLE NO RATES OF

00:54:25.662 --> 00:54:27.130
DEPRESSION ARE HIGHER AMONG

00:54:27.197 --> 00:54:29.633
WOMEN BUT MEN MAY USE MORE

00:54:29.699 --> 00:54:30.867
VIOLENT MEANS OF ATTEMPTING

00:54:30.934 --> 00:54:32.602
SUICIDE THEREFORE MORE LIKELY TO

00:54:32.669 --> 00:54:33.403
COMPLETE IT AND I DON'T KNOW IF

00:54:33.470 --> 00:54:34.371
THAT'S PERHAPS PART OF THE

00:54:34.437 --> 00:54:35.271
REASON WE SEE SOME OF THE

00:54:35.338 --> 00:54:36.606
VARIATION AND ALSO I DON'T KNOW

00:54:36.673 --> 00:54:36.940
IF THAT HAS.

00:54:37.007 --> 00:54:38.041
ANYTHING TO DO ALSO WITH THE

00:54:38.108 --> 00:54:40.310
REGIONAL VARIATION AS WELL IF IT

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:43.113
LOOKING AT SO IT OUTSIDE RATE IS

00:54:43.179 --> 00:54:45.115
IT IT IS IT'S WHAT SUICIDALITY

00:54:45.181 --> 00:54:48.485
COMPARED TO COMPLETION OF

00:54:48.551 --> 00:54:50.286
SUICIDE.

00:54:50.353 --> 00:54:51.154
YEAH THOSE THOSE TWO SLIDES THAT

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.622
SHOWED SUICIDE RATES BY REGION

00:54:52.689 --> 00:54:53.923
AND BY GENDER AND ETHNICITY WORK

00:54:53.990 --> 00:54:55.425
COMPLETED SUICIDE SUICIDALITY

00:54:55.492 --> 00:54:56.292
YOU'RE EXACTLY RIGHT.

00:54:56.359 --> 00:54:57.360
IS IT IS A DIFFERENT THING A

00:54:57.427 --> 00:54:59.763
BIGGER AND IT DOES HAVE THOSE --

00:54:59.829 --> 00:55:01.297
THOSE DIFFERENTIALS IN TERMS OF

00:55:01.364 --> 00:55:02.732
GENDER SO --

00:55:02.799 --> 00:55:03.600
PARTICULARLY TEENAGERS GIRLS

00:55:03.667 --> 00:55:08.772
MORE LAW ASIDE BOYS MORE LIKELY

00:55:08.838 --> 00:55:09.205
TO COMPLETE CITIES.

00:55:09.272 --> 00:55:10.306
OKAY.

00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:11.641
WE CAN WE WON'T GET INTO MEANS

00:55:11.708 --> 00:55:12.509
WE CAN.

00:55:12.575 --> 00:55:13.677
ENGAGE IN TO TRY TO REDUCE

00:55:13.743 --> 00:55:14.944
ACTION COMPLETION.

00:55:15.011 --> 00:55:16.112
AS WELL AS PREVENTION OF

00:55:16.179 --> 00:55:17.981
SUICIDALITY AND FINALLY --

00:55:18.048 --> 00:55:20.283
IN TERMS OF THE FUNDING --

00:55:20.350 --> 00:55:22.052
FOR EXAMPLE FOR MENTAL HEALTH I

00:55:22.118 --> 00:55:22.686
MADE REFERENCE MY INTRODUCTION

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:26.423
MARX IS THIS INCLUDE FOR EXAMPLE --

00:55:26.489 --> 00:55:28.124
THE RESOURCES USED.

00:55:28.191 --> 00:55:29.959
BY CRIMINAL JUSTICE SO WE TALK

00:55:30.026 --> 00:55:31.361
ABOUT THE FACT THAT OUR JAILS

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:32.829
ARE OFTEN ARE MAJOR MENTAL

00:55:32.896 --> 00:55:34.097
HEALTH PROVIDERS COURSE PEOPLE

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:35.398
WONDER INCARCERATED DON'T GET

00:55:35.465 --> 00:55:36.700
MEDI CAL --

00:55:36.766 --> 00:55:38.401
REINCORPORATE IN THAT SPENDING

00:55:38.468 --> 00:55:39.969
AS WELL INTO THIS GRAPH OR IS

00:55:40.036 --> 00:55:43.373
THIS MAINLY LOOKING AT

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:46.643
REIMBURSEMENT --

00:55:46.710 --> 00:55:47.811
FOR SERVICES AND COMMUNITY.

00:55:47.877 --> 00:55:49.379
YET THE THE VERY HIGH LEVEL --

00:55:49.446 --> 00:55:51.281
NATIONAL CHARTS THAT JUST SHOW

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.248
THE OVERALL HEALTH SPENDING

00:55:52.315 --> 00:55:53.316
BUDGET THE OVERALL MENTAL HEALTH

SPENDING BUDGET ARE REALLY

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:55.118
PULLED FROM THE HEALTH CARE

00:55:55.185 --> 00:55:56.920
SYSTEM SO WOULD NOT INCLUDE

00:55:56.986 --> 00:55:58.288
OTHER.

00:55:58.354 --> 00:55:59.923
OTHER SOURCES THAT MIGHT BE

00:55:59.989 --> 00:56:02.692
SPENDING ON ON MENTAL HEALTH

00:56:02.759 --> 00:56:03.326
SERVICES OUTSIDE JUST MAKE NOTE

00:56:03.393 --> 00:56:06.196
THAT PUBLIC SPEND ON MENTAL

00:56:06.262 --> 00:56:07.731
HEALTH IS MUCH LARGER THAN WE

00:56:07.797 --> 00:56:08.898
MAY BE SEEING HERE MAYBE WE

00:56:08.965 --> 00:56:10.300
SHOULD TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT

00:56:10.366 --> 00:56:11.301
THAT CERTAINLY I KNOW.

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:13.203
OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

00:56:13.269 --> 00:56:14.771
SPENDS A LOT OF NOT ONLY EFFORT

00:56:14.838 --> 00:56:15.905

ABOUT WATER APPROACHES ARE AND

00:56:23.379 --> 00:56:24.881
WHAT MUCH WERE.

SHOULD BE SPENDING WE SHOULD BE

00:56:27.016 --> 00:56:28.518
THINKING ABOUT HOW MUCH WE'RE

00:56:28.585 --> 00:56:31.087
CURRENTLY SPENDING NOW THANK YOU

00:56:31.154 --> 00:56:31.387

00:57:47.697 --> 00:57:49.799
DIG DOWN TOO MUCH FURTHER WE CAN

00:57:49.866 --> 00:57:51.234
CERTAINLY LOOK INTO THAT --

00:57:51.301 --> 00:57:52.902
AND SEE WHAT ELSE WE CAN WHAT

00:57:52.969 --> 00:57:54.404
OTHER DATA WE CAN PULL THAT

00:57:54.470 --> 00:57:57.040
GIVES MORE OF A MORE OF A

00:57:57.106 --> 00:57:58.174
PICTURE FOR THE NORTHERN SIERRA

00:57:58.241 --> 00:58:00.476
REGION IN PARTICULAR.

00:58:00.543 --> 00:58:00.944
I GUESS --

00:58:01.010 --> 00:58:02.312
LIKE I DID DID YOU BEGIN TO

00:58:02.378 --> 00:58:03.313
WONDER I THINK WE STRUGGLE IN

00:58:03.379 --> 00:58:04.080
NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH

00:58:04.147 --> 00:58:05.481
PROVIDERS --

00:58:05.548 --> 00:58:06.683
IN GENERAL --

00:58:06.749 --> 00:58:08.418
AND I LOOK AT YOUR DATA IN

00:58:08.484 --> 00:58:10.486
GENERAL THE FOR IT ENJOY A CROP

00:58:10.553 --> 00:58:12.021
ROUGHLY A THIRD OF THE PEOPLE

00:58:12.088 --> 00:58:13.089
WHO WHO.

00:58:13.156 --> 00:58:14.924
ARE UP THERE RECOGNIZES NEEDING

00:58:14.991 --> 00:58:17.794
CARE OR GETTING AT I DO WONDER

00:58:17.861 --> 00:58:18.862
HOW THAT RICK HOW THAT.

00:58:18.928 --> 00:58:20.663
RATE GOES FOR OTHER PARTS OF THE

00:58:20.730 --> 00:58:22.932
STATE OF I KNOW FROM MY AND OUR

00:58:22.999 --> 00:58:24.234
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE IN THE NORTH

00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:25.668
THE NORTH PART OF STATE IT'S

00:58:25.735 --> 00:58:26.803
IT'S HARD GETTING PROVIDERS IT'S

00:58:26.870 --> 00:58:28.905
A REAL CHALLENGE SO --

00:58:28.972 --> 00:58:30.139
YOU BASED A LOT OF DATA WAS

00:58:30.206 --> 00:58:33.009
BASED ON TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:34.244
FIFTEEN NUMBERS.

00:58:34.310 --> 00:58:35.745
ANY IDEA WHAT WHAT THE TRENDS

00:58:35.812 --> 00:58:37.447
ARE WITHOUT.

00:58:37.513 --> 00:58:39.215
YOU KNOW WITHOUT GOING TOO FAR

00:58:39.282 --> 00:58:40.283
OUT ON A LIMB --

00:58:40.350 --> 00:58:42.151
WHERE WHERE DO YOU SEE SOME OF

00:58:42.218 --> 00:58:45.655
THE TRENDS GOING?

00:58:45.722 --> 00:58:46.856
I THINK.

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:48.591
BECAUSE BASED ON WHAT WE'VE SEEN

00:58:48.658 --> 00:58:51.027
IN PAST VERSIONS OF THIS I THINK

00:58:51.094 --> 00:58:52.495
THE OVERALL PREVALENCE OF

00:58:52.562 --> 00:58:54.697
ILLNESS I THINK IS PRETTY STATIC

00:58:54.764 --> 00:58:56.499
AND AGAIN.

00:58:56.566 --> 00:58:57.967
I DON'T THINK THAT'S SURPRISING

00:58:58.034 --> 00:58:58.768
IS -- MENTAL

00:58:58.835 --> 00:58:59.302
ILLNESS IS A MAJOR CHRONIC

00:58:59.369 --> 00:59:02.105
ILLNESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN WITH US

00:59:02.171 --> 00:59:03.806
AND I DON'T EXPECT THAT IT IS IT

00:59:03.873 --> 00:59:04.741
IT.

00:59:04.807 --> 00:59:07.377
IS THAT IT WILL GO AWAY NOR --

00:59:07.443 --> 00:59:09.545
SHOULD THAT BE OUR GOAL --

00:59:09.612 --> 00:59:12.649
I DO THINK THAT WE SHOULD I HOPE --

00:59:12.715 --> 00:59:13.950
WITH THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE

00:59:14.017 --> 00:59:15.551
ALL AND GIVING PEOPLE MORE

00:59:15.618 --> 00:59:16.886
ACCESS TO SERVICES.

00:59:16.953 --> 00:59:18.821
I WOULD EXPECT TO SEE AND HOPE

00:59:18.888 --> 00:59:20.323
TO SEE INCREASED RATES OF

00:59:20.390 --> 00:59:21.324
TREATMENT INCREASED RATES OF

00:59:21.391 --> 00:59:23.693
ACCESS TO CARE FOR PEOPLE BUT I

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.395
THINK THAT REMAINS TO BE SEEN.

00:59:25.461 --> 00:59:26.496
AND I THINK THAT'S A MY

00:59:26.562 --> 00:59:27.697
COLLEAGUES TO FOLLOW UP ON

00:59:27.764 --> 00:59:29.299
ADDITIONAL PANELS WILL MAY HAVE

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:32.402
MORE OF RECENT DATA FROM THE

00:59:32.468 --> 00:59:34.537
MEDICARE PROGRAM IN PARTICULAR.

00:59:34.604 --> 00:59:35.238
I KNOW THAT THE CALIFORNIA

00:59:35.305 --> 00:59:35.738
HEALTH CARE FOUNDATIONS

00:59:35.805 --> 00:59:37.573
WORKFORCE COMMISSION.

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.509

00:59:41.611 --> 00:59:42.812

00:59:44.213 --> 00:59:45.682
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

00:59:45.748 --> 00:59:46.816
IN THE WORK FORCE PERSPECTIVE

00:59:46.883 --> 00:59:48.084
AND THERE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:59:48.151 --> 00:59:50.887
SHORTAGE OF OF A PROVIDERS AND

00:59:50.954 --> 00:59:52.455
SO PART OF THE STRATEGY IS

00:59:52.522 --> 00:59:53.690
OBVIOUSLY TO GET MORE PROVIDERS

00:59:53.756 --> 00:59:54.824

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:51.627
AND THEY INTERACT WITH THE

01:03:51.694 --> 01:03:52.929
COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS OF

FIFTY EIGHT I'LL LET YOU GUESS

01:03:56.632 --> 01:03:58.167
WHICH COUNTIES HAVE CONSOLIDATED

01:03:58.234 --> 01:04:00.102
PLANS BUT THERE'S ONLY FIFTY SIX

01:04:00.169 --> 01:04:01.237
OF THEM --

01:04:01.304 --> 01:04:02.405
AND THERE ARE MEMORANDUMS OF

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:03.739

01:04:03.806 --> 01:04:05.741
HAVE A RECIPIENT PERHAPS WITH A

01:04:05.808 --> 01:04:07.043
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS --

01:04:07.109 --> 01:04:08.778
SUCH AS SCHIZOPHRENIA --

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.213
AND I WILL USE THE COUNTY OF

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.847
MONTEREY AS AN EXAMPLE --

01:04:11.914 --> 01:04:12.982
IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WITH

01:04:13.049 --> 01:04:14.650

SERVICES FOR THAT BENEFICIARY

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:20.890
BUT THE REST OF THE CARE WILL BE

01:04:20.957 --> 01:04:21.691
PROVIDED THROUGH CENTRAL

01:04:21.757 --> 01:04:22.959
CALIFORNIA ALLIANCE FOR HEALTH

WHICH HAS THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

01:04:25.161 --> 01:04:26.262
THEIR OVERALL PHYSICAL HEALTH

01:04:26.329 --> 01:04:27.063
AND SO.

01:04:27.129 --> 01:04:28.598
THE COUNTY AND THE PLAN HAVE TO

01:04:28.664 --> 01:04:30.933
WORK TOGETHER TO COORDINATE THAT

01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:32.301
CARE -- AND

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.202
THEN.

01:04:33.269 --> 01:04:35.605
ALL OF THIS IS FINANCED THROUGH

01:04:35.671 --> 01:04:36.973
AND I KNOW THAT THE AGENDA --

01:04:37.039 --> 01:04:38.374
TALKS ABOUT IT A LITTE BIT AND

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:39.875
I KNOW THAT THE ELIA WILL SPEAK

01:04:39.942 --> 01:04:41.177
TO THIS IN THE SECOND PANEL OR

01:04:41.244 --> 01:04:42.712
THE NEXT PANEL --

01:04:42.778 --> 01:04:45.781
THERE ARE A VARIETY OF FUN

01:04:45.848 --> 01:04:47.383
SOURCES THAT HELP GUIDE THIS

01:04:47.450 --> 01:04:48.551
WORK THAT IS DELIVERED BETWEEN

01:04:48.618 --> 01:04:50.253
BOTH THE MANAGED CARE PLANS AND

01:04:50.319 --> 01:04:51.954
THE COUNTY MENTAL HEALTH PLANS.

01:04:52.021 --> 01:04:53.189

01:04:53.256 --> 01:04:54.657
TWO KINDS OF REALIGNMENTS FUN

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:56.592
FUNDS THERE ARE --

01:04:56.659 --> 01:05:00.029

GENERAL FUND --

01:05:01.530 --> 01:05:03.899
I LIKE TO SAY THAT COUNTIES --

01:05:03.966 --> 01:05:05.067
WHEN SERVING THESE --

01:05:05.134 --> 01:05:07.370
BENEFICIARIES THEY CAN USE WHAT

01:05:07.436 --> 01:05:09.538
WE CALL BRAIDED FUNDING WHICH

01:05:09.605 --> 01:05:10.806
MEANS YOU CAN HAVE.

YOU CAN BILL MEDI CAL FOR

01:05:12.308 --> 01:05:13.242
CERTAIN SERVICES THAT ARE

AUTHORIZED UNDER THE NINETEEN

01:05:15.144 --> 01:05:15.711
FIFTEEN WAIVER ANNA AND COVERED

01:05:15.778 --> 01:05:17.346

01:05:19.682 --> 01:05:20.650
BENEFICIARY.

01:05:20.716 --> 01:05:21.884
IN WHICH THEY CAN USE MENTAL

01:05:21.951 --> 01:05:23.286
HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING

01:05:23.352 --> 01:05:25.288
WHICH IS MORE FUNGIBLE AND MORE

01:05:25.354 --> 01:05:27.290
FLEXIBLE YOU CAN USE BLOCK GRANT

01:05:27.356 --> 01:05:28.224
FUNDING YOU CAN USE COUNTY

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:29.725

MENTAL DISEASE AND THOSE ARE NOT.

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:34.964
CAPABLE THERE'S A LOT OF

01:05:35.031 --> 01:05:36.332
COMPLEXITY --

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.767
I CANNOT STRESS ENOUGH THAT THIS

01:05:37.833 --> 01:05:38.934
IS PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.736
COMPLEX AREAS OF OUR PROGRAM

01:05:40.803 --> 01:05:42.571
THAT WE ADMINISTER BETWEEN US

01:05:42.638 --> 01:05:44.006
AND THE COUNTIES --

01:05:44.073 --> 01:05:45.308
SO THE OVERSIGHT --

01:05:45.374 --> 01:05:47.176
THE MECHANICS THE FINANCING THE

01:05:47.243 --> 01:05:47.943
CLAIMING --

01:05:48.010 --> 01:05:49.211
IS SOMETHING THAT WE DO IN

01:05:49.278 --> 01:05:50.846
PARTNERSHIP WITH THE COUNTIES

01:05:50.913 --> 01:05:51.681
AND THEN --

01:05:51.747 --> 01:05:52.381
VICE VERSA --

01:05:52.448 --> 01:05:53.949
WE ALSO WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH

01:05:54.016 --> 01:06:00.489
THE MANAGED CARE WATER IT --

01:06:00.556 --> 01:06:03.426
TO ALSO BIG POPULATION RULES

01:06:03.492 --> 01:06:04.493
THAT I WOULD --

01:06:04.560 --> 01:06:06.862
REMIND THIS COMMITTEE OF THERE

01:06:06.929 --> 01:06:08.030
IS A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

01:06:08.097 --> 01:06:09.832
PEDIATRIC POPULATION AND THE

01:06:09.899 --> 01:06:11.600
ADULT POPULATION AS IT PERTAINS

01:06:11.667 --> 01:06:12.168
TO SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

01:06:12.234 --> 01:06:13.135
SERVICES.

01:06:13.202 --> 01:06:15.905
SO UNDER ON THE AGENDA WHICH IS --

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.273
DOES A REALLY NICE JOB OF TRYING

01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.374
TO BREAK IT OUT --

01:06:18.441 --> 01:06:20.609
IT PRETTY SIMPLISTIC MANNER IN

01:06:20.676 --> 01:06:22.978
TERMS OF THE SPECIFIC DISEASES

01:06:23.045 --> 01:06:25.648
THAT ARE CATEGORIZED AS MEETING

01:06:25.715 --> 01:06:27.750
THE DEFINITION OF SPECIAL TO

01:06:27.817 --> 01:06:29.585
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. FOR

01:06:29.652 --> 01:06:32.455
CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY

01:06:32.521 --> 01:06:35.057
ONE DO TWO EPS D. T. THESE.

01:06:35.124 --> 01:06:36.726
AND THE SCOPE OF WHAT CAN BE

01:06:36.792 --> 01:06:38.327
PROVIDED TO THAT INDIVIDUAL IS

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:40.529
MUCH BROADER THE STANDARDS ARE

01:06:40.596 --> 01:06:42.865
MUCH MORE FLEXIBLE IN ORDER TO

01:06:42.932 --> 01:06:44.767
DELIVER THOSE SERVICES AND THEN

01:06:44.834 --> 01:06:45.601
ONE AN INDIVIDUAL.

01:06:45.668 --> 01:06:48.037
BECOMES AN ADULT AT THE AGE OF

01:06:48.104 --> 01:06:50.005
TWENTY ONE THE CRITERIA FOR BOTH

01:06:50.072 --> 01:06:51.907
THE SERVICES PROVIDED AS WELL AS

01:06:51.974 --> 01:06:53.976
THE FLEXIBILITY CHANGES --

01:06:54.043 --> 01:06:55.745
FAIRLY DRAMATICALLY AND SO I

01:06:55.811 --> 01:06:56.579
WOULD --

01:06:56.645 --> 01:06:58.581
ARGUE THAT THAT IS ALSO A VERY

01:06:58.647 --> 01:06:59.949
SIGNIFICANT DISTINCTION FOR

01:07:00.015 --> 01:07:01.250
INDIVIDUALS LIKE IF WE WERE

01:07:01.317 --> 01:07:02.785
TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE THAT WAS.

01:07:02.852 --> 01:07:04.320
RECENTLY DIAGNOSED WITH

01:07:04.387 --> 01:07:05.688
SCHIZOPHRENIA AND WE WERE

01:07:05.755 --> 01:07:07.056
WHISPERING --

01:07:07.123 --> 01:07:07.656
ON THE PREVIOUS PANEL IN TERMS

01:07:07.723 --> 01:07:11.360
OF THAT WHEN AN INDIVIDUAL FIRST

01:07:11.427 --> 01:07:13.295
HAS -- AS A

01:07:13.362 --> 01:07:15.030
SCHIZOPHRENIC --

01:07:15.097 --> 01:07:15.598
BEHAVIOR PATTERN --

01:07:15.664 --> 01:07:17.299
EPISODE IS USUALLY AROUND THE

01:07:17.366 --> 01:07:18.934
AGE OF EIGHTEEN OR NINETEEN

01:07:19.001 --> 01:07:20.970
IRONICALLY AND IN SOME CASES --

01:07:21.036 --> 01:07:22.371
TRAGICALLY THAT IS KIND OF AT

01:07:22.438 --> 01:07:24.507
THE END OF YOUR ABILITY TO

01:07:24.573 --> 01:07:25.975
RECEIVE SERVICES UNDER THE EPS

01:07:26.041 --> 01:07:28.944
D. T. TYPE OF SCHEME AS OPPOSED

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:30.946
TO GOING INTO AN ADULT SO --

01:07:31.013 --> 01:07:32.415
I'M HAPPY --

01:07:32.481 --> 01:07:33.582
TO ANSWER MORE QUESTIONS AND

01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:34.617
THEN THE ONLY THING THAT I WOULD

01:07:34.683 --> 01:07:35.851
LIKE TO KIND OF STRESS TO IN

01:07:35.918 --> 01:07:37.787
TERMS OF DATA AND I KNOW THAT --

01:07:37.853 --> 01:07:39.021
WE PROVIDED THIS TO THE

01:07:39.088 --> 01:07:40.156
COMMITTEE AND ARE CERTAINLY

01:07:40.222 --> 01:07:41.657
HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP AS WELL IS

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.225
THAT SINCE WE INSTITUTED THE

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:44.860
MILD TO MODERATE BENEFIT AND THE

01:07:44.927 --> 01:07:46.095
MANAGED CARE PLANS WE HAVE BEEN

01:07:46.162 --> 01:07:47.897
TRACKING THE UTILIZATION ACROSS

01:07:47.963 --> 01:07:50.032
THE PLANS --

01:07:50.099 --> 01:07:50.866
AND HAVE SEEN SOME PRETTY

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:53.002
SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN BOTH

01:07:53.068 --> 01:07:55.771
YOUTH AND ADULT --

01:07:55.838 --> 01:07:58.274
TAKE UP RATES AND SO WHEN YOU

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.708
TALK ABOUT --

01:07:59.775 --> 01:08:02.111
KIDS UNDER THE AGE OF TWENTY ONE

01:08:02.178 --> 01:08:03.145
GETTING CARE THROUGH THE MEDICAL

01:08:03.212 --> 01:08:04.346
MANAGED CARE --

01:08:04.413 --> 01:08:06.348
BENEFIT WE STARTED IN THE FIRST

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:08.317
YEAR TWENTY THIRTEEN FOURTEEN

01:08:08.384 --> 01:08:10.085
WITH ONLY TWELVE THOUSAND NINE

01:08:10.152 --> 01:08:11.387
HUNDRED AND FIFTY SIX CHILDREN --

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:12.822
THAT HAS GROWN TO THE LAST YEAR

01:08:12.888 --> 01:08:16.659
AND SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND

01:08:16.725 --> 01:08:17.359
CHILDREN.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:19.028
ON THE ADULT SIDE IT STARTED

01:08:19.094 --> 01:08:20.830
AROUND THIRTY TWO THOUSAND

01:08:20.896 --> 01:08:22.531
INDIVIDUALS USING THE MILD TO

01:08:22.598 --> 01:08:24.333
MODERATE BENEFIT AND NOW WE'RE

01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:27.503
OVER A HUNDRED AND TWO HUNDRED

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.171
AND EIGHTY SEVEN THOUSAND SO IN

01:08:29.238 --> 01:08:31.140
THE COURSE OF THE YEARS SINCE WE

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.274
HAVE IMPLEMENTED THE AFFORDABLE

01:08:32.341 --> 01:08:34.009
CARE ACT AND INSTITUTED THAT

01:08:34.076 --> 01:08:35.244
BENEFIT --

01:08:35.311 --> 01:08:37.313
WE HAVE SEEN A GROWING AMOUNT OF

01:08:37.379 --> 01:08:38.647
UTILIZATION OF THOSE SERVICES

01:08:38.714 --> 01:08:40.149
WHICH WE THINK IS ACTUALLY --

01:08:40.216 --> 01:08:42.284
A VERY SIGNIFICANT POSITIVE

01:08:42.351 --> 01:08:44.553
BENEFIT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE

01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:45.888
RECEIVING CARE THROUGH THE SHORT

01:08:45.955 --> 01:08:47.656
DOYLE SYSTEM WHICH IS THE COUNTY

01:08:47.723 --> 01:08:48.958
MENTAL HEALTH --

01:08:49.024 --> 01:08:50.559
SYSTEM HAS REMAINED FAIRLY

01:08:50.626 --> 01:08:52.127
STEADY AND STATIC AND SO THAT

01:08:52.194 --> 01:08:53.796
CERTAINLY SUPPORTS THE DATA

01:08:53.863 --> 01:08:55.231
REFERENCE BY C. H. C. F..

01:08:55.297 --> 01:08:56.832
BUT WHAT HAS BEEN INTERESTING IS

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.167
THAT INDIVIDUALS ARE GETTING

01:08:58.234 --> 01:09:00.436
SERVICES IN BOTH AREAS SO THERE

01:09:00.503 --> 01:09:02.638
IS A SMALL AND GROWING NUMBER OF

01:09:02.705 --> 01:09:04.173
POPULATION THAT IS NOT ONLY

01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:05.608
GETTING SERVICES AND THE SPECIAL

01:09:05.674 --> 01:09:06.375
TO MENTAL HEALTH.

01:09:06.442 --> 01:09:08.210
AREA BUT THEY'RE ALSO GETTING

01:09:08.277 --> 01:09:09.845
CARE FROM THEM MANAGED CARE PLAN

01:09:09.912 --> 01:09:11.647
SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY USING BOTH

01:09:11.714 --> 01:09:13.048
SIDES OF THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH

01:09:13.115 --> 01:09:14.984
SYSTEM WHICH WE ALSO THINK IS

01:09:15.050 --> 01:09:16.785
BOTH ENCOURAGING AND POSITIVE.

01:09:16.852 --> 01:09:19.388
SO WITH THAT I WILL STOP AND

01:09:19.455 --> 01:09:24.827
HAPPILY US INTO QUESTIONS.

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:28.130
QUESTIONS UNTIL THE END PANEL

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:30.099

SO THANK YOU FOR TAKING TIME TO

01:09:37.206 --> 01:09:38.207
TRY TO EXPLAIN WHAT IS A VERY

01:09:38.274 --> 01:09:39.208
VERY COMPLEX SERVICE DELIVERY

01:09:39.275 --> 01:09:40.576
SYSTEM AND I THINK I WANT TO SAY

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:41.477
BEFORE I START TALKING ABOUT ALL

01:09:41.544 --> 01:09:42.344
OF OUR COMPLEXITY I THINK THE

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:43.612
FUTURE LOOKS VERY BRIGHT.

01:09:43.679 --> 01:09:44.947
YOU KNOW PARTNERING WITH DH CS

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.015

01:09:46.081 --> 01:09:47.283
CHANGES TO OUR WAIVER AND REDUCE

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.450
THIS COMPLEXITY.

01:09:48.517 --> 01:09:50.319
SO WE CAN YOU KNOW BETTER SERVE

01:09:50.386 --> 01:09:53.489
THE BENEFITS AND FUNDING NOT

01:09:53.556 --> 01:09:54.790
NECESSARILY GO UP.

01:09:54.857 --> 01:09:56.392
SOME OF THIS IS ALREADY IT SAID

01:09:56.458 --> 01:09:58.327
BUT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SYSTEMS

01:09:58.394 --> 01:09:58.994
OVERALL WORK CARVE OUT SO WE'RE

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.963
CONSIDERED A PREPAID INPATIENT

01:10:01.030 --> 01:10:01.730
HEALTH PLAN.

01:10:01.797 --> 01:10:04.166
OUR FIRST OBLIGATION IS COVERING

01:10:04.233 --> 01:10:06.502
ALL IN PATIENT COSTS --

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:08.037
SO WE OPERATE A NETWORK OF

01:10:08.103 --> 01:10:08.671
PROVIDERS YOU GUYS ARE ASKING

01:10:08.737 --> 01:10:09.905
SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT NETWORK

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.807
ADEQUACY AND CERTAINLY WE SEE --

01:10:11.874 --> 01:10:13.442
IN MORE URBAN COUNTIES WE SEE A

01:10:13.509 --> 01:10:14.743
LOT OF PEOPLE WORKING WITH

01:10:14.810 --> 01:10:16.011
CONTRACTED PROVIDERS THAT THAT

01:10:16.078 --> 01:10:17.346
REALLY THRIVE BUT IN RURAL

01:10:17.413 --> 01:10:18.247
COUNTIES.

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:19.982
MANY OF THE COUNTY SYSTEMS ARE

01:10:20.049 --> 01:10:21.850
YOU KNOW SOLELY COUNTY STAFF

01:10:21.917 --> 01:10:23.552
MEMBERS PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES.

01:10:23.619 --> 01:10:24.453
SO THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF

01:10:24.520 --> 01:10:26.388
DIVERSITY IN THE STATE IN ORDER

01:10:26.455 --> 01:10:27.856
TO RESPONSE TO THE DIFFERENT

01:10:27.923 --> 01:10:30.125
GEOGRAPHY.

01:10:30.192 --> 01:10:31.860
THIS IS THAT REALLY IMPORTANT

01:10:31.927 --> 01:10:32.895
GRAPHICS SO DIRECTOR CAN'T

01:10:32.962 --> 01:10:33.929
ALREADY TALKED ABOUT THIS BUT

01:10:33.996 --> 01:10:35.331
OUR WORLD IS KIND OF COMPLICATED

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:37.566
BECAUSE WE'RE SORT OF A SPECTRUM

01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.201
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:10:39.268 --> 01:10:41.303
SO COUNTIES HAVE YOU KNOW THE

01:10:41.370 --> 01:10:42.504
PURPLE IN THE LIGHT I MEAN

01:10:42.571 --> 01:10:43.572
EXCUSE ME THE ORANGE IN THE

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:44.573
LIGHTER ORANGE WITH --

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.141
THE MODERATE AND SEVERE MENTAL

01:10:46.208 --> 01:10:47.576
ILLNESS SO YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.178
THOSE DISORDERS VERY VERY SEVERE

01:10:49.244 --> 01:10:51.447
DEPRESSION BIPOLAR SCHIZOPHRENIA.

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:54.650
WE DO NOT HAVE THE MILD MODERATE --

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:55.651
BUT BEHAVIOR HEALTH IS KIND OF

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:56.819
CONFUSING BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:58.153
STILL STRUGGLING TO SAY WHAT IS

01:10:58.220 --> 01:11:00.289
MILD MODERATE VERSUS SEVERE YOU

01:11:00.356 --> 01:11:00.956
KNOW IT'S NOT LIKE AN A. ONE C.

01:11:01.023 --> 01:11:03.158
SCORE YOU GET AN EXACT NUMBER.

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:04.159
AND YOU CAN SAY THAT PERSON'S

01:11:04.226 --> 01:11:05.494
ALWAYS GOING TO BE EXACTLY THIS

01:11:05.561 --> 01:11:07.296
WAY WE SEE A LOT OF MOVEMENT

01:11:07.363 --> 01:11:08.731
WITH BENEFICIARIES THEIR NEEDS

01:11:08.797 --> 01:11:09.598
CHANGING.

01:11:09.665 --> 01:11:11.200
AND CERTAINLY IF WE'RE NOT ABLE

01:11:11.266 --> 01:11:14.203
TO SERVE THEM WELL CONTINUE ON

01:11:14.269 --> 01:11:14.970
WE SEE PEOPLE BECOMING MORE

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.005
SEVERE.

01:11:16.071 --> 01:11:17.740
AND UTILIZING CRISIS SERVICES

01:11:17.806 --> 01:11:18.507
WHICH IS NOT WHERE WE WANT TO

01:11:18.574 --> 01:11:20.009
SEE PEOPLE WE WANT TO COMING

01:11:20.075 --> 01:11:21.410
INTO OUR OPEN ACCESS STORES.

01:11:21.477 --> 01:11:22.945
YOUR CLINICS ARE SCHOOL BASED

01:11:23.012 --> 01:11:25.214
PROGRAMS NOT TO EMERGENCY ROOMS

01:11:25.280 --> 01:11:25.714
ARE INTERACTING WITH LAW

01:11:25.781 --> 01:11:26.882
ENFORCEMENT.

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:28.384
ALSO COUNTIES --

01:11:28.450 --> 01:11:29.852
HAD PREVENTION FUNDS THROUGH AND

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:32.021
WE JUST SAY DOLLARS THAT PROVIDE

01:11:32.087 --> 01:11:34.223
QUITE A BIT A ROBUST PROGRAMMING.

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:35.791
THIS IS MY ONE OF MY BEST

01:11:35.858 --> 01:11:37.292
EFFORTS TO DESCRIBE HOW

01:11:37.359 --> 01:11:38.594
COMPLICATED OUR FUNDING IS.

01:11:38.661 --> 01:11:41.530
SO EACH PERSON THAT WE SERVE HAS

01:11:41.597 --> 01:11:42.598
A DIFFERENT EIGHT CODE AND EIGHT

01:11:42.665 --> 01:11:43.832
CO DETERMINES HOW MUCH FEDERAL

01:11:43.899 --> 01:11:45.134
FINANCING YOU'RE ABLE TO PULL

01:11:45.200 --> 01:11:46.135
DOWN.

01:11:46.201 --> 01:11:48.370
SO LIKE THE PERSON IN JAIL WE DO

01:11:48.437 --> 01:11:49.938
SOME JAIL SERVICES AS YOUNG

01:11:50.005 --> 01:11:50.806
CLINICIAN I USED TO GO TO THE

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.241
JAIL AND DO ASSESSMENTS TRY TO

01:11:52.307 --> 01:11:54.076
HELP PEOPLE LIAISON OUT THAT

01:11:54.143 --> 01:11:54.810
WOULD NOT BE A CLEAN MOBILE

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:55.978
SERVICE ABOUT BE SOMETHING THE

01:11:56.045 --> 01:11:56.845
COUNTY WOULD DO.

01:11:56.912 --> 01:11:58.180
IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND

01:11:58.247 --> 01:11:59.314
THERE'D BE ZERO DOLLARS

01:11:59.381 --> 01:12:00.315
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT USING

01:12:00.382 --> 01:12:01.884
REALIGNMENT OR OTHER FUNDING

01:12:01.950 --> 01:12:03.819
SOURCES --

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:05.587
BUT EACH PERSON HAS --

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:07.089
IF THEIR NEWLY ELIGIBLE THAT

01:12:07.156 --> 01:12:08.190
HIGHER EIGHT CODE IF YOU'RE

01:12:08.257 --> 01:12:09.391
UNDOCUMENTED THAT'S THE PERSON

01:12:09.458 --> 01:12:11.293
ON THE AND THAT'S 0% SO WHEN

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:13.028
WE'RE SERVING AND DOCUMENTED --

01:12:13.095 --> 01:12:14.063
WE HAVE TO DO THAT WITH OUR

01:12:14.129 --> 01:12:15.631
REALIGNMENT FUNDING SO IT'S KIND

01:12:15.698 --> 01:12:17.166
OF A COMPLEX RUBRIC AS A

01:12:17.232 --> 01:12:18.567
BUSINESS PERSON THERAPIST

01:12:18.634 --> 01:12:20.035
CONVERTED TO BUSINESS PERSON I

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:23.072
USED TO BE YOUNG THERAPIST NOW

01:12:23.138 --> 01:12:26.642
RUN THE SYSTEM.

01:12:26.709 --> 01:12:28.043
NO IT'S IT'S HERE.

01:12:28.110 --> 01:12:29.478
WHO'S THE PERSON ON THE FAR LEFT

01:12:29.545 --> 01:12:30.813
IS THAT THE DATA DOESN'T GIVE ME

01:12:30.879 --> 01:12:35.851
SERVICES YEAH SO YOU KNOW IF.

01:12:35.918 --> 01:12:37.453
SOMETIMES I MEAN ACA'S REALLY

01:12:37.519 --> 01:12:38.554
HELPED US OUT TO THE GROWTH THAT

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:39.521
YOU SEEN WITH A CA BASED ON

01:12:39.588 --> 01:12:40.823
POVERTY BUT WHEN I WAS STARTING

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:42.624
IN THE SYSTEM SO OFTEN YOU'D SEE

01:12:42.691 --> 01:12:44.059
PEOPLE WHERE THE FATHER WOULD

01:12:44.126 --> 01:12:45.761
NEVER BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL.

01:12:45.828 --> 01:12:47.296
YEAH SO EASY IS A BIG GAME

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:48.263
CHANGER FOR US SO YOU HAVE A

01:12:48.330 --> 01:12:49.498
MOTHER ELIGIBLE BASED ON THE

01:12:49.565 --> 01:12:50.933
FACT THAT SHE'S A MOTHER TO BE A

01:12:50.999 --> 01:12:52.234
50% EIGHT CODE THE KID WOULD

01:12:52.301 --> 01:12:53.168
HAVE A HIGHER AID CODE AND THE

01:12:53.235 --> 01:12:54.002
DAD WOULD GET NOTHING.

01:12:54.069 --> 01:12:55.237
AND THEN CLEANING FOR THOSE

01:12:55.304 --> 01:12:56.438
FAMILY SERVICES ON OUR CURRENT

01:12:56.505 --> 01:12:57.973
BILLING ENVIRONMENT CAN BE VERY

01:12:58.040 --> 01:13:00.242
VERY COMPLEX --

01:13:00.309 --> 01:13:02.778
SO YOU'LL OFTEN SEE COUNTY IS DO

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:04.113
THE RIGHT THING FOR THE THE

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:05.481
CLIENT WITHIN WHILE FOLLOWING

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:08.283
ALL RULES ESTABLISHED BY

01:13:08.350 --> 01:13:10.385
JENNIFER CAM.

01:13:10.452 --> 01:13:12.788
FOR FIND IT DIFFICULT BEING NEXT

01:13:12.855 --> 01:13:14.389
YEAR BOX.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:15.290
AND THEN ONE OF THE OTHER KEY

01:13:15.357 --> 01:13:16.959
THINGS I WANT TO POINT OUT.

01:13:17.025 --> 01:13:18.327
IS SO ARE FUNDING RUBRICS WE USE

01:13:18.393 --> 01:13:19.128
ALL THESE DIFFERENT TYPES OF

01:13:19.194 --> 01:13:21.563
FUNDING SOURCES --

01:13:21.630 --> 01:13:23.465
TO PULL DOWN FEDERAL FUNDING.

01:13:23.532 --> 01:13:24.800
SO -- WE

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.034
LOOK AT THE MENTAL HEALTH

01:13:26.101 --> 01:13:28.370
SERVICES ACT WHICH IS ONE POINT

01:13:28.437 --> 01:13:29.705
SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS.

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.840
REALIGNMENT FROM TWO THOUSAND

01:13:31.907 --> 01:13:33.342
ELEVEN ONE POINT THREE NINETEEN

01:13:33.408 --> 01:13:34.476
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT ONE POINT

01:13:34.543 --> 01:13:35.611
THREE WERE USING THOSE DIFFERENT

01:13:35.677 --> 01:13:37.312
LOCAL SOURCES TO PULL AS MUCH

01:13:37.379 --> 01:13:39.014
FEDERAL MONEY AS POSSIBLE SO

01:13:39.081 --> 01:13:41.116
THAT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:41.717
IN A COUNTY WITH HIGH POVERTY

01:13:41.784 --> 01:13:42.451
RATE.

01:13:42.518 --> 01:13:43.886
ALMOST HALF MY POPULATIONS ON

01:13:43.952 --> 01:13:45.554
MEDI CAL I CONSIDER ALMOST A

01:13:45.621 --> 01:13:47.523
MORAL OBLIGATION TO POINT AS

01:13:47.589 --> 01:13:48.857
MUCH FEDERAL FINANCING AS

01:13:48.924 --> 01:13:50.359
POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO MAKE THE

01:13:50.425 --> 01:13:52.728
PROGRAM SUSTAINABLE --

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.062
BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT FEDERAL

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:57.666
FINANCING YOU CAN'T REALLY

01:13:57.733 --> 01:13:59.034
EXPANDED PROVIDE SERVICES WE'VE

01:13:59.101 --> 01:14:00.602
CERTAINLY SEEN DEMANDS FOR

01:14:00.669 --> 01:14:02.905
SERVICES INCREASE.

01:14:02.971 --> 01:14:03.505
THE GOING BACK TO RUNNING A

01:14:03.572 --> 01:14:04.673
WEIRD BUSINESS IN OUR WORLD

01:14:04.740 --> 01:14:06.542
ECONOMY GOES DOWN SAR FUNDING

01:14:06.608 --> 01:14:08.110
GOES DOWN BUT DEMAND GOES UP.

01:14:08.177 --> 01:14:11.914
SO THAT'S THAT'S NOT BEEN FUN.

01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:14.416
VERY VERY COMPLEX FUNDING FOR US.

01:14:14.483 --> 01:14:15.584
WE LOOK AT WHAT WE DOING A

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:17.452
SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES

ALREADY MATURE DOING UP.

01:14:18.453 --> 01:14:19.254
ASSESSMENTS AND PREVENTION

01:14:19.321 --> 01:14:20.756
SERVICES WE'RE DOING A LOT OF

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:21.824
COUNSELING THROUGH AND I JUST

SAY WERE DOING WHAT ARE CALLED

01:14:22.524 --> 01:14:24.026
FULL SERVICE PARTNERSHIPS THAT

01:14:24.092 --> 01:14:25.027
THE WHATEVER IT TAKES MODEL.

01:14:25.093 --> 01:14:26.128
THE PROVIDES A VERY VERY

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:29.131
INTENSIVE SERVICE LEVEL XIN

01:14:29.198 --> 01:14:30.299
PEOPLE MENTION SOME OF THE

01:14:30.365 --> 01:14:31.667
MOBILE RESPONSE TEAMS IN

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:33.235
PARTNERSHIP WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:14:33.302 --> 01:14:35.771
OR COMMUNITY BASED --

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:37.105
SYMBOLS DOING ASSESSMENTS AND

01:14:37.172 --> 01:14:38.240
EMERGENCY ROOM.

01:14:38.307 --> 01:14:38.841
COUNTY BEHAVIOR HEALTH PLANS

01:14:38.907 --> 01:14:40.943
COVER ALL INPATIENT PSYCHIATRIC

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:43.378
SERVICES AND THEN WE ALSO DO

01:14:43.445 --> 01:14:45.380
RESIDENTIAL SERVICES SO IN MY

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:47.015
COUNTY I HAVE QUITE AN EXTENSIVE.

01:14:47.082 --> 01:14:49.218
MEMBER SIDE OF BENEFICIARIES IN

01:14:49.284 --> 01:14:50.485
STATE HOSPITALS ARE I AM D.

01:14:50.552 --> 01:14:51.820
PLACEMENTS WERE YOU YOU'RE NOT

01:14:51.887 --> 01:14:53.355
ABLE TO PULL IN FEDERAL FUNDING

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.623
FUNDING FOR THAT.

01:14:54.690 --> 01:14:55.924
SUCH ALL REALIGNMENT DOLLARS

01:14:55.991 --> 01:14:57.159
THAT'S MY VERY HIGH AND

01:14:57.226 --> 01:14:58.527
BENEFICIARIES THEY CAN'T SAFELY

01:14:58.594 --> 01:15:00.028
BE IN THE COMMUNITY AT A LOWER

01:15:00.095 --> 01:15:01.096
LEVEL OF KERR.

01:15:01.163 --> 01:15:02.564
SO IT'S A VERY EXPENSIVE SERVICE

01:15:02.631 --> 01:15:05.033
LINE THE COUNTIES MANAGE WE

01:15:05.100 --> 01:15:07.803
MANAGE THAT RISK --

01:15:07.870 --> 01:15:08.537
THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:09.605
TERMS OF WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR

01:15:09.671 --> 01:15:10.639
CHILDREN'S I THINK THAT

01:15:10.706 --> 01:15:11.206
COMMITTEE WAS ASKING SOME

01:15:11.273 --> 01:15:11.974
QUESTIONS ABOUT.

01:15:12.040 --> 01:15:13.108
YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT'S THE

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:14.142
DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE

01:15:14.209 --> 01:15:15.577
PREVALENCE RATE FOR KIDS VERSES

01:15:15.644 --> 01:15:16.578
ADULTS.

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:17.913
THE SYSTEM IS MUCH MORE OPEN

01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.848
RESPIRE FOR TO BE VERY OPEN FOR

01:15:19.915 --> 01:15:20.616
CHILDREN.

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:21.750
SO EXAMPLE IN MY COUNTY WE

01:15:21.817 --> 01:15:23.919
ASSESS A 100% OF FOSTER KIDS

01:15:23.986 --> 01:15:24.486
KIDS THAT ARE BROUGHT INTO

01:15:24.553 --> 01:15:25.888
FOSTER CARE.

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:26.889
YOU KNOW TO SEE IF THEY HAVE A

01:15:26.955 --> 01:15:27.823
MENTAL ILLNESS MORE PREVENTION

01:15:27.890 --> 01:15:29.958
PERSPECTIVES WE KNOW IF WE DELAY

THURMOND ACCOUNT IT'S PROBABLY A

01:22:03.518 --> 01:22:04.653
COMBINATION --

01:22:04.719 --> 01:22:06.421
IN SO WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK INTO

01:22:06.488 --> 01:22:08.323

TRYING TO TITRATE AND MAKE SURE

01:22:13.962 --> 01:22:15.864
THAT THE MEDICATION IS ACTUALLY

01:22:15.930 --> 01:22:17.866
APPROPRIATE THEY COULD BE

01:22:17.932 --> 01:22:19.534
WRITING IT IN CERTAIN AMOUNTS

01:22:19.601 --> 01:22:20.035
AND THEN --

01:22:20.101 --> 01:22:21.569
WE ACTUALLY PAY FOR THE PHARMACY

01:22:21.636 --> 01:22:23.405
ON THE MEDICAL SIDE AND SO IT

01:22:23.471 --> 01:22:24.773
DEPENDS ON THE DRUG AND

01:22:24.839 --> 01:22:26.007
DEPENDING ON THE UTILIZATION

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:27.409
CONTROLS THAT WE HAVE FOR THAT

01:22:27.475 --> 01:22:30.145
PARTICULAR SCRIPTS WE MAY HAVE

01:22:32.213 --> 01:22:34.582
FILL OUT TIRES EACH THIRTY DAYS.

01:22:34.649 --> 01:22:35.650
TO YEAH IT DOESN'T DRIVELIKE I

01:22:35.717 --> 01:22:37.218
KNOW THAT WE PROVIDED SOME

01:22:37.285 --> 01:22:38.953

TO THE COMMITTEE AROUND THE CAR

01:22:39.954 --> 01:22:41.656
ABOUT BECAUSE WE PAY FOR ALL OF

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:42.891
THE ANTI PSYCHOTICS ARE NOT

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:44.659
INCLUDED IN THE MEDI CAL MANAGED

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:45.827

IT'S OVER A BILLION DOLLARS AND

01:22:55.670 --> 01:22:57.072
SO SOME OF THOSE PRESCRIPTIONS

01:22:57.138 --> 01:23:00.241
WE PROBABLY ONLY ALLOCATING

01:23:00.308 --> 01:23:00.875

EIGHT IT DOES JUST PROVIDE A

01:23:22.430 --> 01:23:25.467
PARTICULAR HARD TO GET TO THE

THIS IS A FRONTIER UNFORTUNATELY

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:53.895
THAT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO

01:23:53.962 --> 01:23:55.964
FIGURE OUT IN FROM THE EARLIER

01:23:56.030 --> 01:23:57.465
SLIDES.

01:23:57.532 --> 01:24:00.335
BEING CONTINUED GROWTH I DON'T

01:24:00.402 --> 01:24:01.836
KNOW THAT ANYONE HAS A GOOD.

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:04.038
UNDERSTANDING OF WHY OUR SOCIETY

IS PRODUCING.

BUT IT SEEMS LIKE.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:17.585
SOME OF THE EARLY DETECTION AND

01:24:17.652 --> 01:24:20.522
PREVENTION PROGRAMS ARE AT LEAST

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:23.558

THAT SENATOR LEAVE UP I HAD A

01:24:45.980 --> 01:24:47.182

MALE FEMALE CHILD.

01:24:57.659 --> 01:24:58.860
ARE WE TO UNDERSTAND THAT IN A

01:24:58.927 --> 01:25:01.563
FAMILY UNIT.

01:25:01.629 --> 01:25:04.966
RECEIVE CARE BUT THE MALE OR THE

01:25:05.033 --> 01:25:05.200
FATHER.

01:25:05.266 --> 01:25:07.469
DOES NOT.

01:25:07.535 --> 01:25:10.772
YEAH BUT INDIVIDUALLY AS A MALE

01:25:10.839 --> 01:25:12.373
HE CAN RECEIVE CARE IT'S REALLY

01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:14.075
ALL BASED OUR WHOLE WORLD IS

01:25:14.142 --> 01:25:16.444
MEDI CAL EIGHT CODES SO MEDI CAL

01:25:16.511 --> 01:25:17.712
EIGHT CODES ARE WHEN PEOPLE SIGN

01:25:17.779 --> 01:25:19.214
UP FOR MEDI CAL IF THEIR NEWLY

01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:21.216
ELIGIBLE UNDER THE ACA THEY HAVE

01:25:21.282 --> 01:25:22.617
A VERY HIGH REIMBURSEMENT RATE

01:25:22.684 --> 01:25:23.051
BUT THAT'S REALLY.

01:25:23.117 --> 01:25:24.819
ABOUT THEIR LEVEL OF POVERTY AND

01:25:24.886 --> 01:25:26.354
THEN THEIR ABILITY TO RENEW MEDI

01:25:26.421 --> 01:25:27.856
CAL BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO RENEW

01:25:27.922 --> 01:25:29.057
EVERY YEAR.

01:25:29.123 --> 01:25:30.492
AND SO WE OFTEN SEE YOU KNOW

01:25:30.558 --> 01:25:31.926
PEOPLE NOT RESPONDING TO THE

01:25:31.993 --> 01:25:33.595
PAPER WORK AND GETTING IT

01:25:33.661 --> 01:25:35.363
RENEWED AND WE SEE CHANGES IN

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:37.265
ELIGIBILITY SO SOMETHING THAT

01:25:37.332 --> 01:25:38.666
UNFORTUNATELY WE IN BEHAVIOR HOW

01:25:38.733 --> 01:25:40.101
SPEND QUITE A BIT OF TIME ON SO

01:25:40.168 --> 01:25:40.902
MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE

01:25:40.969 --> 01:25:42.537
UNDERSTAND THE WEIRD GOVERNMENT

01:25:42.604 --> 01:25:43.738
FORMS.

01:25:43.805 --> 01:25:46.441
WE'VE ALSO SEEN IN A WEIRD

01:25:46.508 --> 01:25:49.444
GOVERNMENT.

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:50.812
FOR A POLISH KNOWLEDGE SAY THAT

01:25:50.879 --> 01:25:51.946
AND YOU.

01:25:52.013 --> 01:25:54.449
ALL GOVERNMENT FORMS ARE

01:25:54.516 --> 01:25:58.219
WONDERFUL FOR SHORT --

01:25:58.286 --> 01:25:59.554
BUT THEN WE'VE ALSO SEEN SOME

01:25:59.621 --> 01:26:01.089
FEAR RIGHT SO WE'VE ACTUALLY

01:26:01.155 --> 01:26:02.757
SEEN A DECLINE MEDI CAL

01:26:02.824 --> 01:26:04.292
ENROLLMENT SOMEWHAT LOCALLY WITH

01:26:04.359 --> 01:26:05.426
PEOPLE BEING AFRAID BECAUSE

01:26:05.493 --> 01:26:06.661
UNDOCUMENTED CHILDREN ARE

01:26:06.728 --> 01:26:07.562
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT FOR

01:26:07.629 --> 01:26:09.197
AND UNDOCUMENTED FAMILY THAT'S

01:26:09.264 --> 01:26:10.198
THE ONLY WAY SIR THEIR FAMILIES

01:26:10.265 --> 01:26:10.999
KNOWN TO THE GOVERNMENT AND SO

01:26:11.065 --> 01:26:11.299
WE'VE SEEN.

01:26:11.366 --> 01:26:12.300
A DECREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:26:12.367 --> 01:26:13.201
CHILDREN ENROLLED IN MEDICARE

01:26:13.268 --> 01:26:14.168
WE'RE TRYING TO DO SOME PUBLIC

01:26:14.235 --> 01:26:15.270
INFORMATION CAMPAIGNS.

01:26:15.336 --> 01:26:16.704
YOU KNOW TO CHANGE THAT BUT

01:26:16.771 --> 01:26:20.074
THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFICULT CAL.

01:26:20.141 --> 01:26:21.609
SO THE COMPLEX WORLD WHEN I HAVE

01:26:21.676 --> 01:26:23.344
PEOPLE IN HUMANS WALKING INTO MY

01:26:23.411 --> 01:26:24.345
CLINIC.

01:26:24.412 --> 01:26:25.346
AND ABOVE THEM IS DIFFERENT

01:26:25.413 --> 01:26:26.548
NEEDS IN DIFFERENT AID CODES AND

01:26:26.614 --> 01:26:27.749
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE IT ALL

01:26:27.815 --> 01:26:28.983
RECONCILE AT THE END OF THE YEAR

01:26:29.050 --> 01:26:30.084
SO THAT'S WHY WHEN YOU HEAR US

01:26:30.151 --> 01:26:31.719
TALK ABOUT PAYMENT REFORM IN OUR

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:32.554
PASSION FOR THAT.

01:26:32.620 --> 01:26:33.855
WOULD SORT OF LIKE TO LEVEL THE

01:26:33.922 --> 01:26:35.523
PLAYING FIELD AND USE YOU KNOW

01:26:35.590 --> 01:26:36.925
THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE I

01:26:36.991 --> 01:26:38.293
REDUCING A LOT OF THE PAPERWORK

01:26:38.359 --> 01:26:40.061
BURDEN AND POTENTIALLY SERVING

01:26:40.128 --> 01:26:41.863
UP MANY MORE BENEFICIARIES.

01:26:41.930 --> 01:26:43.898
IT IF I IF I MAY IT JUST BRINGS

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:45.066
UP --

01:26:45.133 --> 01:26:46.100
ADDITIONAL STUDIES THAT HAVE

01:26:46.167 --> 01:26:48.603
BEEN MADE THAT HAVE IMPACTED LOW

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:49.938
INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IN

01:26:50.004 --> 01:26:52.540
WHICH THE IN ORDER FOR A MOTHER

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:55.009
OR A CHILD TO RECEIVE AID.

01:26:55.076 --> 01:26:56.444
WHETHER IT'S THROUGH MEDICAL OR

01:26:56.511 --> 01:26:58.012
OTHER TYPES OF SERVICE.

01:26:58.079 --> 01:26:59.681
THE THE FATHER HAS OFTEN BEEN

01:26:59.747 --> 01:27:02.417
EXCLUDED FROM THAT FORMULA.

01:27:02.483 --> 01:27:05.987
AND HAS CREATED A A SYSTEM.

01:27:06.054 --> 01:27:06.888
THAT -- IS

01:27:06.955 --> 01:27:08.022
NOT HELPFUL TO FAMILIES AND SO

01:27:08.089 --> 01:27:09.257
I'M JUST CURIOUS AS TO HOW WE

01:27:09.324 --> 01:27:10.825
FIX IT AND MAKE SURE THAT THE

01:27:10.892 --> 01:27:12.961
FAMILY UNIT ITSELF IS ABLE TO

01:27:13.027 --> 01:27:15.096
RECEIVE CARE ONE AND I MIGHT.

01:27:15.163 --> 01:27:16.097
I MIGHT JUST HAVE BEEN A LITTLE

01:27:16.164 --> 01:27:16.965
BIT --

01:27:17.031 --> 01:27:18.132
BECAUSE THIS IS.

01:27:18.199 --> 01:27:19.267
A HEARING ON MENTAL HEALTH AND

01:27:19.334 --> 01:27:22.737
NOT ON MEDICAL ELEGY WE THERE'S

01:27:22.804 --> 01:27:24.505
MIXED FAMILIES SO --

01:27:24.572 --> 01:27:25.673
WE HAVE MORE GENEROUS

01:27:25.740 --> 01:27:27.675
ELIGIBILITY IN INCOME STANDARDS

01:27:27.742 --> 01:27:29.377
FOR WOMEN AND CHILDREN SO

01:27:29.444 --> 01:27:31.813
DEPENDING ON YOUR STATUS YOU MAY

01:27:31.879 --> 01:27:33.181
BE MEDICARE ELIGIBLE FOR A

01:27:33.247 --> 01:27:34.816
PERIOD OF TIME THAT OTHERWISE IF

01:27:34.882 --> 01:27:36.484
YOU ARE SINGLE YOU WOULDN'T BE --

01:27:36.551 --> 01:27:38.753
SO WE HAVE ACTUALLY FAMILIES IN

01:27:38.820 --> 01:27:40.521
WHICH THE BILL BOTH PARENTS

01:27:40.588 --> 01:27:41.289
COULD BE WORKING BUT BECAUSE THE

01:27:41.356 --> 01:27:42.790
MOTHER'S PREGNANT SHE CAN HAVE

01:27:42.857 --> 01:27:44.826
LESS INCOME SHE CAN HAVE MORE

01:27:44.892 --> 01:27:46.361
INCOME THAN YOU OTHERWISE WOULD

01:27:46.427 --> 01:27:47.996
BECAUSE OF HER PREGNANCY STATUS

01:27:48.062 --> 01:27:48.896
THAT WE WOULD PUT HER INTO MEDI

01:27:48.963 --> 01:27:49.797
CAL.

01:27:49.864 --> 01:27:50.932
THE FATHER MAY BE EARNING JUST

01:27:50.999 --> 01:27:52.967
ENOUGH THAT HE'S NOT ELIGIBLE

01:27:53.034 --> 01:27:54.502
FOR MEDICARE I'LL SO HE'S MAYBE

01:27:54.569 --> 01:27:56.471
COVER TO COVER CALIFORNIA SO WE

01:27:56.537 --> 01:27:58.072
HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES THAT WE

01:27:58.139 --> 01:27:59.941
OURSELVES BLEND --

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:01.776
I WOULD ALSO JUST SAY BASED ON

01:28:01.843 --> 01:28:02.810
THE SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

01:28:02.877 --> 01:28:05.580
SERVICES CRITERIA YOU WOULD HAVE.

01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:07.515
AN ADULT'S LIKE THE FATHER COULD

01:28:07.582 --> 01:28:09.484
BE -- MILDLY

01:28:09.550 --> 01:28:11.085
DEPRESSED AND HE WOULDN'T MEET

01:28:11.152 --> 01:28:12.754
THE MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA

01:28:12.820 --> 01:28:14.188
IN WHICH THE COUNTY WOULD BE

01:28:14.255 --> 01:28:15.623
ABLE TO PROVIDE SERVICES AT ALL

01:28:15.690 --> 01:28:16.991
THAT WOULD FALL TO THE PLANT'S

01:28:17.058 --> 01:28:18.459
RESPONSIBILITY BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:28:18.526 --> 01:28:19.293
GOING TO BE ENROLLED IN A

01:28:19.360 --> 01:28:21.029
MANAGED CARE PLAN EITHER THROUGH.

01:28:21.095 --> 01:28:21.763
MEDI CAL OR THROUGH COVER

01:28:21.829 --> 01:28:23.531
CALIFORNIA AND SO THIS IS WHERE

01:28:23.598 --> 01:28:25.600
IT REALLY DOES GET --

01:28:25.667 --> 01:28:27.669
VERY VERY COMPLICATED BUT I

01:28:27.735 --> 01:28:29.303
THINK YOU KNOW BOTTOM LINE IS IS

01:28:29.370 --> 01:28:31.039
IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE MADE --

01:28:31.105 --> 01:28:33.041
ALMOST FOUR MILLION INDIVIDUALS

01:28:33.107 --> 01:28:34.275
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL THAT WERE

01:28:34.342 --> 01:28:36.277
OTHERWISE NOT ELIGIBLE PRIOR TO

01:28:36.344 --> 01:28:37.745
THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND SO

01:28:37.812 --> 01:28:38.980
THE EXPANSION.

01:28:39.047 --> 01:28:40.948
AND USE OF SERVICES NOT ONLY IN

01:28:41.015 --> 01:28:42.850
THE MANAGED CARE MEDICAL MANAGED

01:28:42.917 --> 01:28:44.018
CARE THEY WERE REFERENCE BUT THE

01:28:44.085 --> 01:28:46.054
AVAILABILITY OF SERVICES OVERALL

01:28:46.120 --> 01:28:47.255
HAVE CERTAINLY CHANGED THIS

01:28:47.321 --> 01:28:49.090
DYNAMIC QUITE A BIT BUT YOU WILL

01:28:49.157 --> 01:28:51.426
ALWAYS -- DO

01:28:51.492 --> 01:28:52.026
YOU ALWAYS HAVE FAMILIES THAT

01:28:52.093 --> 01:28:55.930
ARE IMITATION STATUS --

01:28:55.997 --> 01:28:56.831
ONE PARENT MAY HAVE A HIGHER

01:28:56.898 --> 01:28:57.699
INCOME BUT BECAUSE OF THE

01:28:57.765 --> 01:28:59.233
PREGNANCY STATUS WE MIGHT HAVE

01:28:59.300 --> 01:29:00.902
PEOPLE I'M STRADDLING BETWEEN

01:29:00.968 --> 01:29:02.837
MEDI CAL AND OTHER COVERAGE SO I

01:29:02.904 --> 01:29:03.838
CAN EXAMPLE OF INNOVATION THAT

01:29:03.905 --> 01:29:05.339
WE DO TO MAKE THINGS HAPPEN IN

01:29:05.406 --> 01:29:06.808
MY EARLY INTERVENTION PROGRAM

01:29:06.874 --> 01:29:08.710
SOME OF THE SERVICES MIGHT BE

01:29:08.776 --> 01:29:10.678
BUILT. TO THE CHILD'S BUT THEY

01:29:10.745 --> 01:29:12.580
ARE CALLED COLLATERAL SERVICES

01:29:12.647 --> 01:29:13.181
WERE YOU'RE HELPING THE WHOLE

01:29:13.247 --> 01:29:13.848
FAMILY.

01:29:13.915 --> 01:29:15.183
SO WE DO THAT TO THE EXTENT

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.684
POSSIBLE TO REALLY HELP KEEP

01:29:16.751 --> 01:29:18.052
FAMILIES TOGETHER AND THAT'S A

01:29:18.119 --> 01:29:19.120
REALLY IMPORTANT THING THAT WE

01:29:19.187 --> 01:29:20.221
DO WITH AND ARE ESPECIALLY

01:29:20.288 --> 01:29:21.856
CHILDREN SYSTEM OF CARE.

01:29:21.923 --> 01:29:24.158
THERE ARE SLIGHT WORKAROUNDS

01:29:24.225 --> 01:29:29.030
THAT ARE THE OKAY THANKYOU AND

01:29:29.097 --> 01:29:30.798
I APOLOGIZE I THINK SOME OF US

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:33.601
IN THE SENATE HAVE TO RUN OUT

01:29:33.668 --> 01:29:34.602
FOR TRAINING THAT'S MANDATE IS --

01:29:34.669 --> 01:29:35.403
TO SHORTLY --

01:29:35.470 --> 01:29:38.740
SO FIRST OF ALL I JUST WANT --

01:29:38.806 --> 01:29:39.574
TO ANDMADE THAT --

01:29:39.640 --> 01:29:41.209
DOCTOR CAN'T THAT YOU SAID THAT --

01:29:41.275 --> 01:29:43.211
AND I APPRECIATE THE INCREASE

01:29:43.277 --> 01:29:45.313
THAT THERE'S NOW WHAT AFFECTS ME

01:29:45.379 --> 01:29:45.947
SEVENTY THREE THOUSAND MILD TO

01:29:46.013 --> 01:29:46.881
MODERATE CHILDREN TO BE SERVED

01:29:46.948 --> 01:29:48.750
BY MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE IS THAT

01:29:48.816 --> 01:29:50.218
CORRECT --

01:29:50.284 --> 01:29:52.286
THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY

01:29:52.353 --> 01:29:52.954
THREE THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT ARE

01:29:53.020 --> 01:29:53.488
GETTING MILD TO MODERATE

01:29:53.554 --> 01:29:54.355
SERVICES --

01:29:54.422 --> 01:29:56.791
THEY MAY ALSO --

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:59.427
BE USING SERVICES IN THE SHORT

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:01.696
DOYLE SYSTEM BECAUSE OF THE PST

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:03.397
T. BENEFIT BUT WE HAVE SEEN THE

01:30:03.464 --> 01:30:05.867
UTILIZATION INCREASE FROM.

01:30:05.933 --> 01:30:09.804
LIKE I SAID AS THAT'S ADULTS TO

01:30:09.871 --> 01:30:11.706
GET MY THOUGHTS OUT OF THE WAY

01:30:11.773 --> 01:30:15.042
IT STARTED AT TWELVE THOUSAND

01:30:15.109 --> 01:30:15.877
IT'S I JUST MAKE NOTE I

01:30:15.943 --> 01:30:17.545
APPRECIATE THAT THAT THE

01:30:17.612 --> 01:30:19.013
INCREASE AND THAT THAT'S GOOD --

01:30:19.080 --> 01:30:21.048
THAT WOULD MAKE NOTE THAT IF YOU

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:22.016
JUST ATTACKED THE NAPKIN

01:30:22.083 --> 01:30:23.351
CALCULATION WE HAVE NINE POINT

01:30:23.417 --> 01:30:24.919
THREE MILLION CHILDREN --

01:30:24.986 --> 01:30:26.154
WE WERE JUST PERCENT OF DATA

01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.522
THAT SAYS THAT IT'S PROBABLY

01:30:27.588 --> 01:30:29.891
ABOVE SEVEN POINT 3% HAVE SEVERE

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:31.492
EMOTIONAL DISTURBANCE.

01:30:31.559 --> 01:30:33.995
AND YOU DO THE MATH THAT'S ABOUT

01:30:34.061 --> 01:30:34.562
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND

01:30:34.629 --> 01:30:35.062
CHILDREN.

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:36.664
NOW OBVIOUSLY NOT ALL OF OUR

01:30:36.731 --> 01:30:38.566
MILD MODERATE THERE'S THESE MORE

01:30:38.633 --> 01:30:40.034
SEVERE BUT SET UP BUT MY GUESS

01:30:40.101 --> 01:30:41.202
IS IS THAT --

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:44.605
WE'RE STILL SERVING ONLY A

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:47.475
FRACTION OF THE CHILDREN.

01:30:47.542 --> 01:30:49.877
ERVING. TO BE FAIR THAT'S ONLY

01:30:49.944 --> 01:30:51.512
IF THAT'S ONLY IN THE MANAGED

01:30:51.579 --> 01:30:52.780
CARE MODERATE MODERATE THERE'S

01:30:52.847 --> 01:30:53.915
TWO HUNDRED AND FORTY TWO

01:30:53.981 --> 01:30:54.749
THOUSAND CHILDREN THAT ARE

01:30:54.816 --> 01:30:57.185
GETTING SHORT OIL SERVICES OKAY.

01:30:57.251 --> 01:30:58.886
AND THAT'S ON THAT'S ADDITIVES

01:30:58.953 --> 01:31:00.655
THAT'S OKAY ALL RIGHT SO THE

01:31:00.721 --> 01:31:02.089
OTHER TO A QUESTION I HAVE THIS

01:31:02.156 --> 01:31:03.524
AND I REALIZE WE'RE GOING TO

01:31:03.591 --> 01:31:04.692
HAVE ANOTHER PANEL WITH LA --

01:31:04.759 --> 01:31:05.526
ONE FINANCING BUT SINCE YOU'RE

01:31:05.593 --> 01:31:08.663
HERE AND THERE AND FINANCING --

01:31:08.729 --> 01:31:10.231
YOU DO THE FINANCING SO THE WAY

01:31:10.298 --> 01:31:11.966
WE FINANCE ON THE MEDICAL SIDE

01:31:12.033 --> 01:31:12.800
IS -- BASED

01:31:12.867 --> 01:31:14.836
ON THAT REALIGNMENT DOLLARS HOW

01:31:14.902 --> 01:31:16.470
ARE THOSE DOLLARS ARE BASICALLY

01:31:16.537 --> 01:31:20.808
I GUESS THE QUESTION IS IS THAT --

01:31:20.875 --> 01:31:22.310
OUR IS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY

01:31:22.376 --> 01:31:23.177
AVAILABLE --

01:31:23.244 --> 01:31:25.513
AT EACH COUNTY RELATED TO THE

01:31:25.580 --> 01:31:26.881
ACTUAL NEED IN THE COUNTY.

01:31:26.948 --> 01:31:29.250
OKAY RIGHT SO I THINK THERE'S A

01:31:29.317 --> 01:31:30.318
PROBLEM THERE RIGHT SO I MEAN I

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.919
MEAN I REALIZE THAT WHAT HAPPENS

01:31:31.986 --> 01:31:33.387
IS THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS

01:31:33.454 --> 01:31:35.223
REALIGNMENT OF WATER YOU KNOW

01:31:35.289 --> 01:31:36.557
THAT'S GOING TO CLOSE DOWN A

01:31:36.624 --> 01:31:38.226
WATERFALL RIGHT YOU KNOW IS THE

01:31:38.292 --> 01:31:39.060
SPOT TO SPOT.

01:31:39.126 --> 01:31:40.294
BUT WE DO HAVE A DISCONNECT

01:31:40.361 --> 01:31:42.830
BETWEEN THE FUNDING AND COUNTIES

01:31:42.897 --> 01:31:45.199
AND THE NECESSARY TO DEMAND

01:31:45.266 --> 01:31:46.367
RIGHT DEPENDING ON HOW THAT.

01:31:46.434 --> 01:31:47.802
HOW THE MONEY THE KIND OF FALLS

01:31:47.869 --> 01:31:49.203
DOWN YOU COULD HAVE EITHER MORE

01:31:49.270 --> 01:31:50.905
OR LESS?

01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:52.106
IF WE THE CHALLENGE OF BEING A

01:31:52.173 --> 01:31:54.976
BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDER IS IF

01:31:55.042 --> 01:31:57.879
WE DO REALLY REALLY WELL IF WE

01:31:57.945 --> 01:31:58.613
SO IT'S GOT A DIFFICULT

01:31:58.679 --> 01:32:00.114
RELATIONSHIP I KEEP A LOT OF

01:32:00.181 --> 01:32:01.649
PEOPLE OUT OF JAIL I'M SPENDING

01:32:01.716 --> 01:32:03.217
MORE MY REALIGNMENT DOLLARS ON

01:32:03.284 --> 01:32:04.585
THAT POPULATION.

01:32:04.652 --> 01:32:06.187
AND LIKE YOU ALREADY ARTICULATED

01:32:06.254 --> 01:32:07.388
YOU KNOW THE JAIL SPENDING IS

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:08.723
TOTALLY SEPARATE SO IT'S A

01:32:08.789 --> 01:32:10.558
REALLY BIG CHALLENGE FOR US IS

01:32:10.625 --> 01:32:12.326
COUNTY SYSTEM THAT THE FUNDING

01:32:12.393 --> 01:32:13.828
DOESN'T AT ALL MATCH.

01:32:13.895 --> 01:32:14.829
YOU KNOW THE INCREASE IN

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:16.097
POPULATION AND THE NEED TO AND

01:32:16.163 --> 01:32:17.431
THAT IS WILL TALK ABOUT LATER

01:32:17.498 --> 01:32:18.766
WITH PERFORMANCE METRICS.

01:32:18.833 --> 01:32:20.334
YOU KNOW TWENTY NEW PEOPLE WALK

01:32:20.401 --> 01:32:21.669
THROUGH THE DOOR AND WE JUST

01:32:21.736 --> 01:32:23.204
NEED TO FIGURE IT OUT RIGHT SO

01:32:23.271 --> 01:32:24.705
WHEN DEMAND INCREASES WE JUST

01:32:24.772 --> 01:32:26.607
HAVE TO TRY TO INNOVATE MAKE

01:32:26.674 --> 01:32:28.342
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE BEST WE CAN.

01:32:28.409 --> 01:32:29.410
YOU KNOW AS RESPOND TO NETWORK

01:32:29.477 --> 01:32:32.146
ADEQUACY STANDARDS SO I THINK WE

01:32:32.213 --> 01:32:33.014
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT.

01:32:33.080 --> 01:32:34.849
WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT WE NEED TO

01:32:34.916 --> 01:32:37.485
KNOW WHAT THE NEED IS.

01:32:37.551 --> 01:32:38.252
SIMPLE THING SAY IT'S HOW

01:32:38.319 --> 01:32:39.353
COMPLEX TO DO BUT WE NEED TO

01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.688
FIGURE OUT AND FIGURE OUT WHERE

01:32:40.755 --> 01:32:42.123
TO DISPARITIES ARE RIGHT WHERE I

01:32:42.189 --> 01:32:43.457
THINK YOU KNOW A LOT OF COUNTIES

01:32:43.524 --> 01:32:44.725
I CAN SAY VERY SPECIFICALLY MY

01:32:44.792 --> 01:32:46.761
COUNTY I'M STRUGGLING IS THE

01:32:46.827 --> 01:32:47.762
INCREASED COSTS OF LIKE THE AYE

01:32:47.828 --> 01:32:49.130
INDIAN STATE HOSPITAL.

01:32:49.196 --> 01:32:50.631
PLACEMENT SO LIKE ONE

01:32:50.698 --> 01:32:52.133
REALIGNMENT CATEGORY THAT'S FOR

01:32:52.199 --> 01:32:53.768
THE ADULT POPULATION I GET

01:32:53.834 --> 01:32:55.369
THIRTEEN MILLION AND I SPENT

01:32:55.436 --> 01:32:56.103
TWELVE MILLION LAST YEAR ON

01:32:56.170 --> 01:32:57.238
PLACEMENTS.

01:32:57.305 --> 01:32:58.205
SOME TRYING TO INNOVATE RIGHT

01:32:58.272 --> 01:32:59.473
I'VE DEVELOPED A NEW TEAM THAT'S

01:32:59.540 --> 01:33:00.741
GOING TO TRY TO GET PEOPLE OUT

01:33:00.808 --> 01:33:01.909
OF THAT LEVEL OF CARE.

01:33:01.976 --> 01:33:03.377
BUT AS WE SEE THAT WE'RE KEEPING

01:33:03.444 --> 01:33:04.645
PEOPLE ALIVE LONGER THEY'RE

01:33:04.712 --> 01:33:06.147
GETTING INTO VERY VERY EXPENSIVE

01:33:06.213 --> 01:33:07.615
PLACEMENTS AND BECAUSE THEY ONCE

01:33:07.682 --> 01:33:08.849
HAD A MENTAL ILLNESS.

01:33:08.916 --> 01:33:10.117
THEY'RE ENDING UP COSTING A

01:33:10.184 --> 01:33:11.352
COUPLE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:33:11.419 --> 01:33:12.753
A YEAR WHEN NOW THEY MIGHT HAVE

01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:14.488
TO MENTION OTHER PROBLEMS BUT IF

01:33:14.555 --> 01:33:16.457
I WASN'T PAYING FOR THAT.

01:33:16.524 --> 01:33:17.692
THOSE PEOPLE WOULD LITERALLY BE

01:33:17.758 --> 01:33:19.794
HOMELESS OKAY SO WE NEED TO LOOK

01:33:19.860 --> 01:33:24.131
AT THAT RIGHT WE NEED TO AND

01:33:24.198 --> 01:33:25.666
ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU HAVE SOME

01:33:25.733 --> 01:33:25.967
[inaudible]

01:33:26.033 --> 01:33:27.835
VERY EXPENSIVE.

01:33:27.902 --> 01:33:29.270
STAND EXACTLY HOW YOU KNOW HOW

01:33:29.337 --> 01:33:31.038
WE A BUFFER AGAINST THAT

01:33:31.105 --> 01:33:33.007
VARIATION ESPECIALLY THE SMALLER

01:33:33.074 --> 01:33:34.308
COUNTY THE LESS LIKELY GIVE YOUR

01:33:34.375 --> 01:33:35.042
AVERAGE THAT OUT.

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:35.676
I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION IN

01:33:35.743 --> 01:33:37.878
TERMS OF OVERSIGHT IS --

01:33:37.945 --> 01:33:38.946
AND I APPRECIATE THAT --

01:33:39.013 --> 01:33:39.981
THERE'S A LOT OF INNOVATION

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:41.649
GOING ON DIFFERENT COUNTIES BUT

01:33:41.716 --> 01:33:43.651
ALSO YOU KNOW SOME DO BETTER

01:33:43.718 --> 01:33:44.018
THAN OTHERS --

01:33:44.085 --> 01:33:46.153
I APPRECIATE Là THE THINGS THAT

01:33:46.220 --> 01:33:48.889
YOU MENTIONED BUT AT COUNTY IN

01:33:48.956 --> 01:33:50.624
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:33:50.691 --> 01:33:52.159
NOT IN EVERY COUNTY BUT THERE'S

01:33:52.226 --> 01:33:53.227
A LOT OF DIFFERENCES IN TERMS OF

01:33:53.294 --> 01:33:54.929
WHAT THE COUNTY NEEDS ARE SO SO

01:33:54.996 --> 01:33:56.364
I THINK WE NEED MORE

01:33:56.430 --> 01:33:58.199
ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT WE WE NEED

01:33:58.265 --> 01:34:00.101
TO KNOW AT STATE WHAT IS GOING

01:34:00.167 --> 01:34:01.402
ON IN EACH COUNTY.

01:34:01.469 --> 01:34:02.703
AND ALSO WE NEED TO BE SURE THE

01:34:02.770 --> 01:34:04.839
BEST PRACTICES ARE BEING

01:34:04.905 --> 01:34:07.508
PRACTICED ACROSS THE STATE THAT

01:34:07.575 --> 01:34:08.509
PEOPLE.

01:34:08.576 --> 01:34:09.643
ACCESS TO MENTAL HEALTH AND THE

01:34:09.710 --> 01:34:11.679
QUALITY TO CARE SHOULD NOT BE

01:34:11.746 --> 01:34:12.313
DEPENDENT ON WHAT COUNTY DO YOU

01:34:12.380 --> 01:34:12.580
LIVE IN.

01:34:12.646 --> 01:34:13.981
NOW REALIZE DIFFERENT COUNTIES

01:34:14.048 --> 01:34:14.815
ARE DIFFERENT YOU KNOW YOU HAVE

01:34:14.882 --> 01:34:15.416
DIFFERENT YEAH THE DIFFERENT

01:34:15.483 --> 01:34:17.351
CHARACTERISTICS BUT AT SOME

01:34:17.418 --> 01:34:18.586
POINT AND I THINK THERE'S A

01:34:18.652 --> 01:34:19.754
THAT'S A BIG FRUSTRATION IS IS

01:34:19.820 --> 01:34:21.155
THAT WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:34:21.222 --> 01:34:22.490
VERY CONCERNED ABOUT MENTAL

01:34:22.556 --> 01:34:22.923
HEALTH.

01:34:22.990 --> 01:34:24.392
DEMANDS NEEDS FOR MENTAL HEALTH

01:34:24.458 --> 01:34:25.593
BUT WHAT WE CAN'T WE'RE HAVING

01:34:25.659 --> 01:34:29.597
CHALLENGES IS THAT WE CAN'T --

01:34:29.663 --> 01:34:31.399
MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE.

01:34:31.465 --> 01:34:32.199
IN YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:34.068
HAPPENING ACROSS THE STATE WE

01:34:34.135 --> 01:34:35.436
HAVE THINGS LIKE THE OPIOID OUT

01:34:35.503 --> 01:34:37.004
NO PROBLEM.

01:34:37.071 --> 01:34:40.141
RIGHT IT'S WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO

01:34:40.207 --> 01:34:41.909
HAVE STATEWIDE.

01:34:41.976 --> 01:34:44.111
WAYS OF ADDRESSING THIS RIGHT --

01:34:44.178 --> 01:34:45.880
THERE ARE THINGS YOU KNOW SCHOOL

01:34:45.946 --> 01:34:46.514
MENTAL HEALTH WE SHOULD THEIR

01:34:46.580 --> 01:34:47.681
THIRD VARIETY OF DIFFERENT

01:34:47.748 --> 01:34:48.549
THINGS THAT --

01:34:48.616 --> 01:34:49.984
WELL CERTAINLY I THINK WE WANT

01:34:50.051 --> 01:34:51.018
TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO COUNTIES

01:34:51.085 --> 01:34:52.420
BE ABLE TO DO.

01:34:52.486 --> 01:34:53.788
THINGS THAT ARE MORE TAILORED AT

01:34:53.854 --> 01:34:54.989
SAME TIME THEY ALSO NEED BE HELD

01:34:55.056 --> 01:34:55.523
ACCOUNTABLE THAT THEY'RE

01:34:55.589 --> 01:34:56.924
DELIVERING A CERTAIN LEVEL OF

01:34:56.991 --> 01:34:57.491
SERVICE AND THAT THERE ARE

01:34:57.558 --> 01:34:58.859
CERTAIN LEVEL CONSISTENCY ACROSS

01:34:58.926 --> 01:34:59.894
THE STATE.

01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.961
THE ONE CHALLENGE WITH FUNDING

01:35:01.028 --> 01:35:02.430
THOUGH IS THAT COUNTY IS --

01:35:02.496 --> 01:35:03.664
A LOT OF THE BIGGER COUNTIES DO

01:35:03.731 --> 01:35:05.199
COUNTY GENERAL FUND SO LIKE IN

01:35:05.266 --> 01:35:05.966
MY COUNTY I GET WHAT'S CALLED

01:35:06.033 --> 01:35:07.168
THE MAINTENANCE OF EFFORT WHICH

01:35:07.234 --> 01:35:08.803
IS THE MINIMUM REQUIRED IN ORDER

01:35:08.869 --> 01:35:09.804
TO HAVE A CONTRACT WITH THE

01:35:09.870 --> 01:35:10.304
STATE.

01:35:10.371 --> 01:35:12.173
OTHER COUNTIES HAVE DEVELOPED

01:35:12.239 --> 01:35:14.942
LIKE SALES TAX --

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:17.144
SAN FRANCISCO SAN MATEO COUNTY

01:35:17.211 --> 01:35:18.913
THEY'RE GETTING I THINK HUNDREDS

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:19.780
OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF THAT

01:35:19.847 --> 01:35:21.315
ARE ALSO ABLE TO LEVERAGE SOME

01:35:21.382 --> 01:35:22.883
MORE FEDERAL DOLLARS AND REALLY

01:35:22.950 --> 01:35:24.452
GROW TO MEET THE SYSTEMS NEEDS.

01:35:24.518 --> 01:35:25.753
AND SO SORT OF A LOCAL

01:35:25.820 --> 01:35:27.321
INVESTMENT MENTAL HEALTH VARIES

01:35:27.388 --> 01:35:29.056
DRASTICALLY AND KIND OF CHANGES

01:35:29.123 --> 01:35:30.524
I THINK I DID A PRESENTATION ON

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:32.093
SCHOOL BASED MENTAL HEALTH I'M

01:35:32.159 --> 01:35:32.726
ABLE TO INNOVATE IN THE SCHOOL

01:35:32.793 --> 01:35:34.428
BASED SETTING. FIVE SCHOOL

01:35:34.495 --> 01:35:35.696
PARTNERS THAT HELP PAY FOR IT

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:37.398
ABSENT THAT WOULD REALLY BE

01:35:37.465 --> 01:35:38.432
STRUGGLING AND SO MANY COUNTIES

01:35:38.499 --> 01:35:40.034
COME TO ME AND SAY I WANT TO DO

01:35:40.101 --> 01:35:40.901
WHAT YOU'RE DOING I WANT THEIR

01:35:40.968 --> 01:35:42.570
PERCENT EVERY SCHOOL THAT'S THE

01:35:42.636 --> 01:35:43.571
RIGHT THING TO DO.

01:35:43.637 --> 01:35:44.972
I SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO

01:35:45.039 --> 01:35:45.840
DO IT.

01:35:45.906 --> 01:35:46.740
SO I THINK YOU HAVE A LOT OF

01:35:46.807 --> 01:35:48.442
EAGER PARTNERS THAT SEE WHERE

01:35:48.509 --> 01:35:49.477
THEY WANT TO BE AND HAVE THAT

01:35:49.543 --> 01:35:50.578
PASSION AND THAT THAT

01:35:50.644 --> 01:35:51.779
UNDERSTANDING OF HOW TO BE

01:35:51.846 --> 01:35:53.114
COMMUNITY BASED.

01:35:53.180 --> 01:35:54.882
IT'S JUST A VERY CHALLENGING

01:35:54.949 --> 01:35:56.417
FUNDING RUBRIC TO MAKE A LOT OF

01:35:56.484 --> 01:35:58.352
THESE THINGS HAPPEN AND THEN YOU

01:35:58.419 --> 01:35:59.653
KNOW THE WAY COUNTIES ARE.

01:35:59.720 --> 01:36:01.689
WE ARE AUDITED SEVERAL YEARS

01:36:01.755 --> 01:36:02.957
AFTER THE FACT IS OR FISCAL

01:36:03.023 --> 01:36:04.925
LIABILITIES WE CAN LOSE MILLIONS

01:36:04.992 --> 01:36:06.694
OF DOLLARS BASED ON THINGS THAT

01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.329
HAPPENED FIVE YEARS AGO.

01:36:08.395 --> 01:36:09.263
AND SO THAT ALSO PUTS MANY

01:36:09.330 --> 01:36:10.264
COUNTIES IN A POSITION WHERE

01:36:10.331 --> 01:36:11.966
THEY'RE AFRAID TO INNOVATE BASED

01:36:12.032 --> 01:36:13.934
ON FISCAL RISK.

01:36:14.001 --> 01:36:14.702
WELL.

01:36:14.768 --> 01:36:15.903
I THINK --

01:36:15.970 --> 01:36:18.105
ACTUALLY SINCE YOUR SETS SITTING

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.373
NEXT TO DIRECTOR CAT AND I KNOW

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.741
IN THE BUDGET WE YOU KNOW

01:36:20.808 --> 01:36:22.376
THERE'S LIKE A HUNDRED AND WHAT

01:36:22.443 --> 01:36:23.511
FORTY MILLION OR SOMETHING PANEL

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:27.548
FEDERAL PENALTIES.

01:36:27.615 --> 01:36:29.183
AND WE NEED TO HAVE A BETTER.

01:36:29.250 --> 01:36:30.751
FIGURE OUT HOW WE DON'T AND IF

01:36:30.818 --> 01:36:32.319
IT.

01:36:32.386 --> 01:36:33.554
FIRST IN TERMS OF OUR

01:36:33.621 --> 01:36:35.256
COMMUNICATIONS I REALIZE THE CMS

01:36:35.322 --> 01:36:36.090
IS CAN ALWAYS BE A BIT

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:37.158
CHALLENGING AND SO FORTH.

01:36:37.224 --> 01:36:38.058
BUT I ALSO THINK THAT --

01:36:38.125 --> 01:36:38.826
IT REALIZE THERE'S GONNA BE

01:36:38.893 --> 01:36:42.096
VARIATIONS IN LOCALITIES --

01:36:42.163 --> 01:36:43.464
BUT THE AND I THINK WE NEED TO

01:36:43.531 --> 01:36:45.166
ALSO TALK ABOUT THE FACT THAT --

01:36:45.232 --> 01:36:48.502
AT THERE'S ONLY THERE NEEDS TO

01:36:48.569 --> 01:36:49.870
BE ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THAT --

01:36:49.937 --> 01:36:51.071
WE SHOULD BE ESTABLISHING STATE

01:36:51.138 --> 01:36:52.940
MENTAL HEALTH GOALS --

01:36:53.007 --> 01:36:53.774
THAT --

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:55.509
COUNTIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE

01:36:55.576 --> 01:36:57.011
FOR AND THAT --

01:36:57.077 --> 01:36:58.179
AND AND THAT OF COURSE THE

01:36:58.245 --> 01:36:59.480
STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:00.447
HELP OUT WITH --

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:02.116
FUNDING AS WELL AND TRYING TO

01:37:02.183 --> 01:37:03.884
FIGURE OUT HOW HOW WE DO THIS

01:37:03.951 --> 01:37:05.219
BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY WE CAN'T

01:37:05.286 --> 01:37:06.320
WE ALL RIGHT NOW.

01:37:06.387 --> 01:37:07.354
A LOT OF TIMES WE DON'T KNOW

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:08.956
WHAT'S GOING ON IN PARTICULAR

01:37:09.023 --> 01:37:10.624
COUNTIES WE HAVE A PATCHWORK AND

01:37:10.691 --> 01:37:11.725
THAT MEANS THAT WHAT KIND OF

01:37:11.792 --> 01:37:13.027
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES YOU GET

01:37:13.093 --> 01:37:15.229
DEPENDS ON WHICH COUNTY LIVE ON

01:37:15.296 --> 01:37:17.198
HOW INNOVATIVE.

01:37:17.264 --> 01:37:18.799
YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR BEHAVIOR

NOT SURE THAT DOES POLITICAL

01:37:23.470 --> 01:37:25.206
BOUNDARIES OF THE BEST WAY TO BE

01:37:25.272 --> 01:37:26.340
TRYING TO DETERMINE --

01:37:26.407 --> 01:37:29.910
QUALITY OF CARE AND I REALIZED

01:37:29.977 --> 01:37:30.477

01:39:25.859 --> 01:39:26.827
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT MANY

01:39:26.894 --> 01:39:28.896
COUNTIES HAVE THAT THERE'S A LOT

01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:29.430
OF INNOVATION IN THAT.

01:39:29.496 --> 01:39:32.866
SPACE I CAN TELL YOU WE LOSE SO

01:39:32.933 --> 01:39:34.234
MUCH MONEY ON THOSE.

01:39:34.301 --> 01:39:35.135
AND NOWHERE NEAR FISCALLY

01:39:35.202 --> 01:39:36.470
SUSTAINABLE --

01:39:36.537 --> 01:39:37.371
IN TERMS OF STAFF COVERING THEIR

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:38.672
COSTS THROUGH BILLING CRISIS

01:39:38.739 --> 01:39:40.274
INTERVENTION IS KIND OF LIKE I

01:39:40.341 --> 01:39:42.276
THINK MANY OF YOU ARE SO SAID

01:39:42.343 --> 01:39:42.843
WITH HEALTH AND ON THE THE

01:39:42.910 --> 01:39:44.111
AMBULANCE SYSTEM STRUGGLES IN

01:39:44.178 --> 01:39:45.045
THE SAME WAY.

01:39:45.112 --> 01:39:46.246
HEAR YOU NEED TO BE RESPONSIVE

01:39:46.313 --> 01:39:47.514
AND TIMELY BUT THEN YOU'RE

01:39:47.581 --> 01:39:49.416
PAYING PEOPLE WHO YOU CAN'T

01:39:49.483 --> 01:39:50.617
REALLY OPTIMIZE ALL OF THEIR

01:39:50.684 --> 01:39:51.218
TIME.

01:39:51.285 --> 01:39:51.985
SO.

01:39:52.052 --> 01:39:53.253
I THINK YOU'RE SEEING A LOT OF

01:39:53.320 --> 01:39:54.288
COUNTIES MAKES MY VESTMENTS I

01:39:54.355 --> 01:39:55.122
KNOW LA IS DOING SOME REALLY

01:39:55.189 --> 01:39:56.657
INCREDIBLE THINGS AROUND MOBILE

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:58.058
UNITS THAT ARE FULLY STAFFED

01:39:58.125 --> 01:39:59.393
INCLUDING CONSUMERS THAT ARE

01:39:59.460 --> 01:40:01.195
TREMENDOUSLY INNOVATIVE --

01:40:01.261 --> 01:40:02.329
SO I KNOW THAT THAT'S HAPPENING

01:40:02.396 --> 01:40:03.897
A LOT OF PLACES IN THE STATE

01:40:03.964 --> 01:40:05.165
WERE REALLY COMMITTED TO IT.

01:40:05.232 --> 01:40:06.767
BUT IT'S A VERY CHALLENGING

01:40:06.834 --> 01:40:09.970
THING TO SUSTAIN FISCALLY.

01:40:10.037 --> 01:40:11.572
SO IF -- THE

01:40:11.638 --> 01:40:12.406
COST UP FRONT IS SOMETHING

01:40:12.473 --> 01:40:15.008
THAT'S OF CONCERN BUT IN THE

01:40:15.075 --> 01:40:17.511
LONG TERM IS IT SOMETHING THAT

01:40:17.578 --> 01:40:18.679
PHYSICALLY.

01:40:18.746 --> 01:40:21.014
BABY SOUND IF WE LOOKED AT IN A

01:40:21.081 --> 01:40:21.615
LONG TERM --

01:40:21.682 --> 01:40:23.450
YEAH AS FAR AS IT SHORT OF

01:40:23.517 --> 01:40:25.085
LOOKING AT THE DOLLARS TODAY BUT

01:40:25.152 --> 01:40:26.453
LOOKING HOW.

01:40:26.520 --> 01:40:27.688
TACKLING OF THE CRISIS

01:40:27.755 --> 01:40:29.723
STABILIZATION AREAS NOW AND IN

01:40:29.790 --> 01:40:31.458
THE LONG TERM WOULD HAVE A

01:40:31.525 --> 01:40:31.925
BETTER --

01:40:31.992 --> 01:40:33.627
OUTCOME CAN BE MORE PREVENTIVE

01:40:33.694 --> 01:40:34.762
TO A LOT OF THESE DIFFERENT

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:36.330
SUBPOPULATIONS THAT ARE THERE.

01:40:36.397 --> 01:40:37.664
YEAH SO LIKE I'M WORKING ON

01:40:37.731 --> 01:40:39.199
TRYING TO EXPAND A CHILDREN'S

01:40:39.266 --> 01:40:40.601
MOBILE CRISIS I WAS DOING THE

01:40:40.667 --> 01:40:42.069
FISCAL ANALYSIS IT'LL COST AT

01:40:42.136 --> 01:40:43.003
ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

01:40:43.070 --> 01:40:45.272
PER YEAR ANTICIPATE FIVE HUNDRED

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:46.807
THOUSAND AND MEDI CAL POTENTIAL

01:40:46.874 --> 01:40:48.175
REIMBURSEMENTS.

01:40:48.242 --> 01:40:49.843
I'M LOOKING AT A MILLION DOLLAR

01:40:49.910 --> 01:40:50.411
GAP.

01:40:50.477 --> 01:40:51.712
RIGHT AND SO I'M GOING TO HEDGE

01:40:51.779 --> 01:40:52.880
MY BETS CAN I REDUCE CHILD

01:40:52.946 --> 01:40:54.281
HOSPITALIZATIONS.

01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:55.983
OUT OF COUNTY PLACEMENTS IT'LL

01:40:56.049 --> 01:40:58.919
BE AN EXPERIMENT TO SEE IF I CAN

01:40:58.986 --> 01:40:59.219
SUSTAIN IT.

01:40:59.286 --> 01:41:00.020
RIGHT.

01:41:00.087 --> 01:41:01.355
BUT THAT'S A PRETTY BIG DOLLAR

01:41:01.422 --> 01:41:02.656
AMOUNT TO HAVE IT AS OPERATING

01:41:02.723 --> 01:41:04.391
LOSS FOR A LINE ITEM OF BUSINESS

01:41:04.458 --> 01:41:05.492
IT'S A IT'S A LARGE DOLLAR

01:41:05.559 --> 01:41:07.661
AMOUNT NOW BUT IF THERE'S A WAY

01:41:07.728 --> 01:41:08.896
TO QUANTIFY IT.

01:41:08.962 --> 01:41:10.330
IN THE FUTURE WITH LONG TERM

01:41:10.397 --> 01:41:12.666
APPROACH TO BE INTERESTED TO SEE

01:41:12.733 --> 01:41:13.700
SOME OF THAT THOSE --

01:41:13.767 --> 01:41:15.135
HAD DATA COMING FORWARD NEXT

01:41:15.202 --> 01:41:19.306
QUESTION I I HAVE IS --

01:41:19.373 --> 01:41:19.940
YOU HAVE WALKING HOURS IN THOSE

01:41:20.007 --> 01:41:23.210
THINGS AND SO TARGETING --

01:41:23.277 --> 01:41:25.112
AND AROUND THE DISCUSSION AGAIN

01:41:25.179 --> 01:41:26.480
I NOTICED MONTEREY COUNTY BUT

01:41:26.547 --> 01:41:27.915
THIS IS THE LARGER DISCUSSION.

01:41:27.981 --> 01:41:29.016
THROUGHOUT THE STATE THE

01:41:29.082 --> 01:41:29.917
HOMELESS YOUTH --

01:41:29.983 --> 01:41:32.619
BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN TO

01:41:32.686 --> 01:41:33.754
TWENTY FIVE ARE WE STILL KEEPING

01:41:33.821 --> 01:41:34.988
THAT INSIDE OF SOME OF THE

01:41:35.055 --> 01:41:36.523
COMPONENT DIALOGUE IT'S THEIR

01:41:36.590 --> 01:41:38.258
ALSO YES WE DO HAVE HOMELESS

01:41:38.325 --> 01:41:39.827
OUTREACH PROGRAMS THE HOMELESS

01:41:39.893 --> 01:41:40.294
YOUTH HAS BEEN PRETTY

01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.628
CHALLENGING TO CAN BE VERY

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:43.030
TRANSIENT POPULATION AND THERE'S

01:41:43.096 --> 01:41:44.798
SIGNIFICANT VARIATIONS BETWEEN

01:41:44.865 --> 01:41:45.933
THE COUNTY IS.

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:46.733
ACTUALLY MONTEREY COUNTY HAS A

01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:47.935
PRETTY SIZEABLE POPULATION OF

01:41:48.001 --> 01:41:50.137
HOMELESS YOUTH SAN FRANCISCO BUT

01:41:50.204 --> 01:41:51.171
SOME OF THEM WERE OR RURAL

01:41:51.238 --> 01:41:51.772
COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING WITH

01:41:51.839 --> 01:41:54.541
THAT. TO THE SAME EXTENT THAT'S

01:41:54.608 --> 01:41:55.776
VERY MUCH A SERVICE FOCUS AND

01:41:55.843 --> 01:41:57.377
THEY'D BE ENTITLED TO A FULL

01:41:57.444 --> 01:41:59.880
RANGE OF BENEFITS.

01:41:59.947 --> 01:42:01.448
SO THOSE TWO ARE OR IS IT --

01:42:01.515 --> 01:42:02.649
YOU KNOW SENATOR PAT WAS TALKING

01:42:02.716 --> 01:42:03.784
ABOUT AS FAR AS FINANCIAL

01:42:03.851 --> 01:42:05.185
RESOURCES AND LEVERAGING THE

01:42:05.252 --> 01:42:06.720
MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL TO THE

01:42:06.787 --> 01:42:08.555
STATE TO THE COUNTY --

01:42:08.622 --> 01:42:10.290
BUT I JUST WANT TO OPEN UP THE

01:42:10.357 --> 01:42:12.025
THE DIALOGUE ON ON THOSE TWO

01:42:12.092 --> 01:42:13.560
SUBJECTS YEAH AND SO IT'S LIKE

01:42:13.627 --> 01:42:14.495
WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT WORD MAKING

01:42:14.561 --> 01:42:15.262
A HOMELESS YOUTH PROGRAM THAT

01:42:15.329 --> 01:42:15.929
WE'RE OFTEN PAYING FOR THE FOOD

01:42:15.996 --> 01:42:17.965

PAYING FOR THAT FULL SPECTRUM

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:26.940
AND THAT THAT'S GOOD AND THAT'S

01:42:27.007 --> 01:42:32.713

01:42:39.987 --> 01:42:41.088
I KNOW MODERATES BEEN INNOVATIVE

01:42:41.154 --> 01:42:42.422
IN EARLY WITH CRISIS

01:42:42.489 --> 01:42:44.491
INTERVENTION TEAMS BEHAVIOR

WASN'T COVERED BUT THAT --

01:43:31.939 --> 01:43:32.472

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:19.513
MILD TO MODERATE TO SEVERE AND

01:45:19.579 --> 01:45:22.582
BACK DO WE HAVE ANY.

01:45:22.649 --> 01:45:23.884
YOU KNOW I I THINK WE THE DATA

01:45:23.950 --> 01:45:25.152
THAT I SHARED --

01:45:25.218 --> 01:45:27.187
IN THE CHARTS THAT I HAVE IS

01:45:27.254 --> 01:45:28.455
KIND OF THE BEST WAY THAT WE

01:45:28.522 --> 01:45:29.756
HAVE IT WITH THAT'S THE KIND OF

01:45:29.823 --> 01:45:31.124
OUR ATTEMPTED A PROXY.

01:45:31.191 --> 01:45:31.658
BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE REALLY

01:45:31.725 --> 01:45:33.760
TRYING TO DO --

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:35.629
IS WE KNOW THE ADULTS AND

01:45:35.696 --> 01:45:36.730
PEDIATRIC POPULATIONS THAT ARE

01:45:36.797 --> 01:45:38.298
USING EXCLUSIVELY SHORT OIL

01:45:38.365 --> 01:45:39.633
SERVICES MEANING THERE'S THERE

01:45:39.700 --> 01:45:40.701
SOLELY IN THE SPECIAL TO MENTAL

01:45:40.767 --> 01:45:42.135
HEALTH SERVICES.

01:45:42.202 --> 01:45:43.570
AND THEN WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS

01:45:43.637 --> 01:45:45.172
THAT ARE SOLELY USING THE MILD

01:45:45.238 --> 01:45:46.073
TO MODERATE BENEFIT IN THE

01:45:46.139 --> 01:45:48.108
MANAGED CARE PLAN AND THEN I

01:45:48.175 --> 01:45:49.409
SAID THERE'S A GAP.

01:45:49.476 --> 01:45:50.744
THAT THEY'RE USING AND

01:45:50.811 --> 01:45:52.479
STRADDLING BOTH --

01:45:52.546 --> 01:45:55.182
SYSTEMS AND WITHIN THAT WE PULL

01:45:55.248 --> 01:45:57.951
THE DATA OUT TO SEE HOW MUCH OF

01:45:58.018 --> 01:45:59.319
THE SHORT OIL SERVICES ARE USING

01:45:59.386 --> 01:46:00.620
VERSUS HOW MUCH OF THE MANAGED

01:46:00.687 --> 01:46:02.155
CARE AND THAT OVERLAP.

01:46:02.222 --> 01:46:03.423
AND THAT'S KIND OF OUR BEST

01:46:03.490 --> 01:46:05.459
CLOSEST --

01:46:05.525 --> 01:46:08.028
WAY OF TRYING TO APPROX ME INTO

01:46:08.095 --> 01:46:10.630
IN BETWEEN THE TWO DELIVERY

01:46:10.697 --> 01:46:12.666
SYSTEMS BUT WE DON'T HAVE LIKE A

01:46:12.733 --> 01:46:14.568
HARD AND FAST KIND OF DATA POINT

01:46:14.634 --> 01:46:15.936
THAT WE CAN JUST PULL OT OF OUR

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.537
DATA WAREHOUSE TO SAY OH YEAH

01:46:17.604 --> 01:46:18.805

YEAR THEY'RE EXCLUSIVELY MILD

01:46:24.244 --> 01:46:26.113
YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T EXIST AND

01:46:26.179 --> 01:46:27.347
NOT KIND OF A NEAT OF A FORMAT

01:46:27.414 --> 01:46:29.416
BUT I'M HAPPY --

01:46:29.483 --> 01:46:31.384
TO SURE THAT DATA IF YOU DON'T

01:46:31.451 --> 01:46:32.886

01:46:32.953 --> 01:46:35.822
THANK YOU --%

01:46:35.889 --> 01:46:38.258
SO WHAT HAPPENS LOCALLY WHEN

01:46:38.325 --> 01:46:40.093
THIS WHEN PEOPLE SLIDE AROUND IN

01:46:40.160 --> 01:46:42.429
THE IN THE CONTINUUM OF CARE --

01:46:42.496 --> 01:46:43.497
SO WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH A

01:46:43.563 --> 01:46:44.698
MANAGED CARE PLAN TO WORK ON

01:46:44.765 --> 01:46:46.066
TRANSITIONS IN CARE SO SAY A

01:46:46.133 --> 01:46:47.334
PERSON WAS SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL

01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.336
OR TRYING TO STEP THEM DOWN SO

01:46:49.402 --> 01:46:51.438
WE TRY TO DO A WARM HAND OFF --

01:46:51.505 --> 01:46:52.572
TO THE EXTENT RESOURCES ARE

01:46:52.639 --> 01:46:54.207
AVAILABLE IN THE MILD NETWORK

01:46:54.274 --> 01:46:55.509
AND WE KNOW THAT WE MONITOR

01:46:55.575 --> 01:46:56.576
QUITE CLOSELY THAT BENEFICIARIES

01:46:56.643 --> 01:46:58.111
ARE NOT RECEIVING BOTH SERVICES

01:46:58.178 --> 01:46:59.479
AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE WE'VE

01:46:59.546 --> 01:47:00.847
SEEN THE MANAGED CARE WHEN A

01:47:00.914 --> 01:47:02.215
PERSON.

01:47:02.282 --> 01:47:03.250
ON THEIR OWN VOLITION TRIES TO

01:47:03.316 --> 01:47:05.152
DO THAT WE'VE SEEN AND PRODUCED

01:47:05.218 --> 01:47:06.586
IN NILES AND AND MOVE A PERSON

01:47:06.653 --> 01:47:07.621
BACK OVER.

01:47:07.687 --> 01:47:09.089
SO WE WORK PRETTY CLOSELY TO TRY

01:47:09.156 --> 01:47:10.490
TO MANAGE THAT BUT IT'S COMPLEX

01:47:10.557 --> 01:47:12.492
BECAUSE PEOPLE'S NEEDS CHANGE

01:47:12.559 --> 01:47:16.530
DAY TO DAY THESE ARE HUMANS NOT

01:47:16.596 --> 01:47:18.532

01:47:29.910 --> 01:47:31.344
THE CHALLENGES WE HAVE GETTING

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:32.412

02:05:12.872 --> 02:05:14.573
COUNTIES ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE

02:05:14.640 --> 02:05:15.908
THAN WE WOULD BE EITHER PUTTING

02:05:15.975 --> 02:05:17.443
THEM UNDER CORRECTIVE ACTION

02:05:17.509 --> 02:05:19.778
PLANS OR IN THE CASE OF EITHER

02:05:19.845 --> 02:05:21.413
PERSISTENT OUR ON GOING --

02:05:21.480 --> 02:05:23.148
FAILURE WE WOULD BE LOOKING AT

02:05:23.215 --> 02:05:24.950
OTHER FINANCIAL --

02:05:25.017 --> 02:05:26.819
SANCTIONS ARE PENALTIES THEM FOR

02:05:26.886 --> 02:05:28.220
THESE FOR THESE AND ALL OF OUR

02:05:28.287 --> 02:05:29.054
MANAGED CARE PLANS THAT HAVE TO

02:05:29.121 --> 02:05:30.890
FILE THESE THIS IS NOT JUST

02:05:30.956 --> 02:05:31.523
ISOLATED TO THE COUNTY MENTAL

02:05:31.590 --> 02:05:32.658
HEALTH PLANS.

02:05:32.725 --> 02:05:33.659
I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT QUALITY

02:05:33.726 --> 02:05:35.027
MONEY IN OVERSIGHT AND I KNOW

02:05:35.094 --> 02:05:37.263
THAT WE SHARED A LOT OF DETAIL --

02:05:37.329 --> 02:05:38.430
WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN TERMS OF

02:05:38.497 --> 02:05:40.599
BACKGROUND DATA --

02:05:40.666 --> 02:05:43.903
WE HAVE A BOTH A GROWING AND A

02:05:43.969 --> 02:05:46.305
MORE ADVANCED SCENE SET OF DATA

02:05:46.372 --> 02:05:47.139
METRICS --

02:05:47.206 --> 02:05:48.874
BROKEN DOWN BY POPULATION BROKEN

02:05:48.941 --> 02:05:50.476
DOWN BY AGE BROKEN DOWN BY

02:05:50.542 --> 02:05:52.411
SERVICE CATEGORY AND REALLY WHAT

02:05:52.478 --> 02:05:53.712
I THINK WE ARE TRYING TO DO

02:05:53.779 --> 02:05:56.448
COLLECTIVELY IS TO LOOK AND SAY

02:05:56.515 --> 02:05:57.983
YOU KNOW ARE THERE COUNTIES --

02:05:58.050 --> 02:05:59.184
SUCH AS THE CONVERSATION THAT WE

02:05:59.251 --> 02:06:01.020
HAD ON THE PANEL BEFORE WHERE

02:06:01.086 --> 02:06:02.955
THEIR OUTCOMES APPEAR TO BE

02:06:03.022 --> 02:06:04.056
SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER THAN

02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:05.491
DIFFERENT COUNTY AND WHAT'S THAT

02:06:05.557 --> 02:06:07.259
RELATED TO AND I THINK THAT IT'S

02:06:07.326 --> 02:06:08.394
ONLY THROUGH.

02:06:08.460 --> 02:06:09.728
KIND OF THIS ADVANCEMENT AND THE

02:06:09.795 --> 02:06:11.096
DATA ANALYTICS --

02:06:11.163 --> 02:06:12.665
AND THE MONITORING AND OVERSIGHT

02:06:12.731 --> 02:06:14.500
AS MUCH AND AS HARD AS IT IS TO

02:06:14.566 --> 02:06:16.368
DO IS THAT'S REALLY WHERE WE'RE

02:06:16.435 --> 02:06:18.070
GOING TO START TO SEE KIND OF

02:06:18.137 --> 02:06:19.805
SUBSTANTIVE CHANGE I THINK AND

02:06:19.872 --> 02:06:22.341
THAT'S THE BOTH ARE --

02:06:22.408 --> 02:06:25.110
INTENSE IN TERMS OF COMPLYING

02:06:25.177 --> 02:06:27.713
WITH THE FEDERAL RULES AND BUT

02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:29.682
ALSO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT WAIVER

02:06:29.748 --> 02:06:31.617
RENEWAL AND WHAT WE WANT TO DO

02:06:31.684 --> 02:06:33.218
AS A STATE GOING FORWARD WE

02:06:33.285 --> 02:06:34.753
CAN'T CREDIBLY COME UP WITH A

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.188
PLAN FOR HOW WE WANT TO GET

02:06:36.255 --> 02:06:37.289
THERE IN THE FUTURE IF WE DON'T

02:06:37.356 --> 02:06:37.556
ACTUALLY.

02:06:37.623 --> 02:06:39.558
KNOW WHERE WHERE THE GAPS ARE

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:41.827
NOW AND SO I WOULD SAY THAT ALL

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:42.494
OF THE WORK THAT WE'VE DONE WITH

02:06:42.561 --> 02:06:44.263
THE COUNTIES --

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:45.764
SO FAR HAS BEEN.

02:06:45.831 --> 02:06:47.399
DONE WITH THE INTEREST OF MAKING

02:06:47.466 --> 02:06:50.135
SURE THAT WE KNOW WHAT WE KNOW

02:06:50.202 --> 02:06:51.904
AND HOW CAN WE MEASURE WHAT WE

02:06:51.971 --> 02:06:53.272
WANT TO IMPROVE AND SO.

02:06:53.339 --> 02:06:54.840
THE QUALITY MONITORING AND THAT

02:06:54.907 --> 02:06:56.742
WE HAVE AND AGAIN LIKE I SAID WE

02:06:56.809 --> 02:06:57.910
WE CERTAINLY ARE HAPPY TO

02:06:57.977 --> 02:06:59.645
PROVIDE THE DETAILS THE

02:06:59.712 --> 02:07:00.879
COMMITTEE MEMBERS AS WELL AS

02:07:00.946 --> 02:07:02.448
WELL -- WE

02:07:02.514 --> 02:07:03.882
LOOK AT PENETRATION RATES WE

02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:06.251
LOOK AT APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES

02:07:06.318 --> 02:07:08.220
WE LOOK AT ACCESS --

02:07:08.287 --> 02:07:10.489
THOSE ARE ALL INTENDED TO HELP

02:07:10.556 --> 02:07:11.457
BOTH DR --

02:07:11.523 --> 02:07:13.292
QUALITY NOT ONLY FOR THE COUNTY

02:07:13.359 --> 02:07:14.660
THAT'S ADMINISTERING THE PROGRAM

02:07:14.727 --> 02:07:16.328
BUT ALSO DRIVE AN OVERALL

02:07:16.395 --> 02:07:18.597
QUALITY STRATEGY THAT WE HAVE --

02:07:18.664 --> 02:07:20.199
HELD OURSELVES AND THE AND THE

02:07:20.265 --> 02:07:22.601
COUNTIES ARE ACCOUNTABLE FOR SO

02:07:22.668 --> 02:07:24.036
YOU HAVE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS AT

02:07:24.103 --> 02:07:26.305
THE END OF THIS BUT IT IS A IT

02:07:26.372 --> 02:07:28.273
IS A HEARING TOPIC WORTHY OF A

02:07:28.340 --> 02:07:30.776
GREAT DEAL OF PAPER AND AND DATA

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:35.848
THAT WE WILL PROBABLY AND SO

02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:36.148
[inaudible]

02:07:36.215 --> 02:07:41.286
SO -- SO.

02:07:41.353 --> 02:07:42.721
WE HAVE A FEW DIFFERENT LAYERS

02:07:42.788 --> 02:07:43.789
OF LOOKING AT QUALITY WITHIN THE

02:07:43.856 --> 02:07:44.456
MENTAL HEALTH PLANS IS IMPORTANT

02:07:44.523 --> 02:07:45.891
REMEMBER THAT IS A MENTAL HEALTH

02:07:45.958 --> 02:07:47.026
PLAN WE OPERATE LIKE.

02:07:47.092 --> 02:07:49.361
DIRECTOR CAN'T SAID WE OVERSEE

02:07:49.428 --> 02:07:50.662
ALL THE SAME MANAGED CARE RULES

02:07:50.729 --> 02:07:52.031
PLUS WE DIRECTLY PROVIDE

02:07:52.097 --> 02:07:53.532
SERVICES TO CLIENTS AND THEN

02:07:53.599 --> 02:07:55.334
OVERSEE IT UP ROBUST NETWORK OF

02:07:55.401 --> 02:07:57.069
CONTRACT FOR WRITERS THAT

02:07:57.136 --> 02:07:58.837
ADDITIONALLY PROVIDE SERVICES.

02:07:58.904 --> 02:08:00.472
SO WE DO TRY ANNUAL REVIEWS

02:08:00.539 --> 02:08:02.074
PERFORMED BY DH CS WE ALSO HAVE

02:08:02.141 --> 02:08:03.475
AN ANNUAL EXTERNAL QUALITY

02:08:03.542 --> 02:08:04.676
REVIEW.

02:08:04.743 --> 02:08:06.211
AUDITS --

02:08:06.278 --> 02:08:07.513
AND THEN WE WORK ON OUR NETWORK

02:08:07.579 --> 02:08:08.714
ADEQUACY --

02:08:08.781 --> 02:08:10.616
STANDARDS OVERALL AND ALL THAT'S

02:08:10.682 --> 02:08:12.184
PUBLICLY AVAILABLE SO THE

02:08:12.251 --> 02:08:12.751
TEACHER --

02:08:12.818 --> 02:08:14.753
AUDIT IS PRETTY ROBUST IN TERMS

02:08:14.820 --> 02:08:16.055
OF LOOKING AT OUR SYSTEM REVIEW

02:08:16.121 --> 02:08:17.556
THEY INTERVIEW CONSUMERS TALK

02:08:17.623 --> 02:08:19.024
ABOUT TIMELINESS OF ACCESS

02:08:19.091 --> 02:08:21.026
MEASURE INDICATORS LIKE OUR

02:08:21.093 --> 02:08:22.394
BENEFICIARIES SERVICE PERFORMED.

02:08:22.461 --> 02:08:24.096
THE COST PER BENEFICIARY AND

02:08:24.163 --> 02:08:25.230
THEN HOW WE'RE SERVING SPECIFIC

02:08:25.297 --> 02:08:27.032
POPULATIONS LIKE THE FOSTER CARE

02:08:27.099 --> 02:08:28.133
POPULATION.

02:08:28.200 --> 02:08:29.635
WE ALSO HAVE TO DO --

02:08:29.701 --> 02:08:30.969
PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS

02:08:31.036 --> 02:08:32.337
AT LEAST TWO PER YEAR TO

INNOVATE AND AND ADMINISTRATIVE

02:08:34.273 --> 02:08:35.374
AND CLINICAL DOMAIN.

02:08:35.441 --> 02:08:37.009
SO THAT'S ANOTHER WAY THAT WERE

02:08:37.076 --> 02:08:41.780
CONTINUALLY WERE OUR SYSTEM --

02:08:41.847 --> 02:08:43.549
THEY ALSO LOOK AT TIMELINESS TO

02:08:43.615 --> 02:08:44.983
ACCESS AND TREATMENT POST

02:08:45.050 --> 02:08:47.086
HOSPITALIZATION TIMELINESS AND

02:08:47.152 --> 02:08:48.654
TIMELINESS --

02:08:48.720 --> 02:08:51.123
TO FIRST APPOINTMENTS THIS IS AN

02:08:51.190 --> 02:08:52.391
EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THE CHARTS

02:08:52.458 --> 02:08:53.492
THAT EACH ROW PROVIDED JUST HAD

02:08:53.559 --> 02:08:55.094
MY COUNTY SWEET COMPARED TO

02:08:55.160 --> 02:08:56.462
OTHER MEDIUM SIZED COUNTY IS.

02:08:56.528 --> 02:08:58.230
THE STATE AND WE LOOK AT OUR OUR

02:08:58.297 --> 02:09:00.065
OWN DATA SOMETHING WE ARE

02:09:00.132 --> 02:09:01.433
CONSTANTLY WORKING ON IS OUR

02:09:01.500 --> 02:09:02.601
PENETRATION RATES.

02:09:02.668 --> 02:09:04.036
SPECIFICALLY WHAT I'M WORKING ON

02:09:04.103 --> 02:09:05.737
MY COUNTY IS THE INCREASING

02:09:05.804 --> 02:09:07.873
SERVICES PATINO POPULATIONS OF

02:09:07.940 --> 02:09:09.007

02:09:09.074 --> 02:09:10.709
I'M ALWAYS LOOKING AT YOU KNOW

02:09:10.776 --> 02:09:11.743
WE'RE STARTING TO DO BETTER

02:09:11.810 --> 02:09:12.945
BETTER THAN STATEWIDE AVERAGES

02:09:13.011 --> 02:09:14.113
BUT WE LOOK AT THE PREVALENCE

02:09:14.179 --> 02:09:15.314
RATE A MENTAL ILLNESS WE KNOW

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:16.548
THAT THERE'S THERE'S SO MUCH

02:09:16.615 --> 02:09:19.518
MORE NEED AND SO MUCH MORE.

02:09:19.585 --> 02:09:21.353
AREAS OF GROWTH --

02:09:21.420 --> 02:09:22.821
WE ALSO TWICE A YEAR ON THE

02:09:22.888 --> 02:09:23.922
MENTAL HEALTH SIDE AND ONCE

02:09:23.989 --> 02:09:25.224
YOU'RE ON ALCOHOL AND DRUGS I DO

02:09:25.290 --> 02:09:27.292
CONSUMER SATISFACTION SURVEYS SO

02:09:27.359 --> 02:09:28.861
WE SURVEY PEOPLE AT OUR CLINICS

02:09:28.927 --> 02:09:30.729
AND IN OUR CONTRACTED PROVIDERS

02:09:30.796 --> 02:09:31.396
YOU'LL SEE THAT THE MOST RECENT

02:09:31.463 --> 02:09:32.331
RIVER.

02:09:32.397 --> 02:09:33.966
RESULTS STATEWIDE PUBLISHED BY

02:09:34.032 --> 02:09:35.534
DH CS SHOW.

02:09:35.601 --> 02:09:36.535
THAT WERE SORT OF HIGH STRENGTH

02:09:36.602 --> 02:09:38.871
AND GENERAL SATISFACTION WHERE

02:09:38.937 --> 02:09:41.039
OUR LOWEST RANKING OVERALL AREA

02:09:41.106 --> 02:09:42.241
IS LAW ON HELPING OUR CONSUMERS

02:09:42.307 --> 02:09:43.942
FEEL SENSE OF CONNECTEDNESS

02:09:44.009 --> 02:09:45.344
WHICH IS JUST A REALLY IMPORTANT

02:09:45.410 --> 02:09:46.311
DOMAIN IN TERMS OF PEOPLE

02:09:46.378 --> 02:09:48.480
ACHIEVING THEIR LIFE GOALS AND

02:09:48.547 --> 02:09:50.716
OUTCOMES.

02:09:50.782 --> 02:09:51.650
THE EACH SPECIAL THE MENTAL

02:09:51.717 --> 02:09:53.118
HEALTH PLAN HAS A PERFORMANCE

02:09:53.185 --> 02:09:54.920
DASHBOARD DIRECTOR CAN'T LARGELY

02:09:54.987 --> 02:09:55.787
ALREADY WENT OVER THAT THAT'S

02:09:55.854 --> 02:09:57.189
BOTH A COUNTY IN OVERALL

02:09:57.256 --> 02:09:59.124
AGGREGATE LEVEL FOR THE STATE.

02:09:59.191 --> 02:10:01.059
SO LOOKING AT STEP DOWNS IN CARE

02:10:01.126 --> 02:10:02.761
NEW PEOPLE HOW QUICKLY WERE

02:10:02.828 --> 02:10:04.863
RESPONDING TO SERVICE.

02:10:04.930 --> 02:10:05.964
THIS IS WHAT A NETWORK ADEQUACY

02:10:06.031 --> 02:10:07.432
MAP LOOKS LIKE IN MY COUNTY SO

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:08.267
IT'S ENSURING OUR TIME AND

02:10:08.333 --> 02:10:08.934
DISTANCE STANDARDS WERE

02:10:09.001 --> 02:10:09.968
PRODUCING THESE ANNUALLY IN

02:10:10.035 --> 02:10:12.004
GETTING RECERTIFIED --

02:10:12.070 --> 02:10:12.804
AND IT'S A DIFFERENT LAYERS THIS

02:10:12.871 --> 02:10:14.339
WAS JUST MY PSYCHIATRY MAP BUT

02:10:14.406 --> 02:10:15.741
THERE'S A LAYER SPECIFICALLY FOR

02:10:15.807 --> 02:10:17.576
CHILDREN FOR ADULTS LOOKING AT

02:10:17.643 --> 02:10:19.611
MAKING SURE THAT IT'S IT

02:10:19.678 --> 02:10:20.145
ACCESSIBLE FOR THE ENTIRE

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:22.214
COMMUNITY.

02:10:22.281 --> 02:10:23.215
AND CERTAINLY TELL HEALTH HELPED

02:10:23.282 --> 02:10:24.349
US TO EXPAND THIS NETWORK EVEN

02:10:24.416 --> 02:10:26.084
MORE SO WE USE TELL HAVE QUITE

02:10:26.151 --> 02:10:27.553
EXTENSIVELY IN RURAL AREAS

02:10:27.619 --> 02:10:29.288
REFUNDED TO REALLY SUCCESSFUL.

02:10:29.354 --> 02:10:30.122
IN PARTICULAR THE LATINO

02:10:30.189 --> 02:10:31.623
POPULATION COMING IN FROM THE

02:10:31.690 --> 02:10:34.393
FIELDS THEY REALLY LIKED THAT --

02:10:34.459 --> 02:10:38.297
MORE SO THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

02:10:38.363 --> 02:10:39.965
AND THE BIG QUESTION BECAUSE WE

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:41.066
COULD LOOK AT DASH WAS FOR

02:10:41.133 --> 02:10:42.034
AWHILE I THINK EVEN DIRECTOR

02:10:42.100 --> 02:10:43.502
CAN'T SAYS OUR DASHBOARD OR

02:10:43.569 --> 02:10:44.870
SLIGHTLY OVERWHELMING. FOR THE

02:10:44.937 --> 02:10:46.138
QUESTION IS WHAT DOES THIS DO

02:10:46.205 --> 02:10:47.639
FOR THE CLIENTS THAT WE SERVE.

02:10:47.706 --> 02:10:49.007
YOU KNOW ULTIMATELY WHAT WE'RE

02:10:49.074 --> 02:10:49.908
DOING THE BEHAVIOR HALL SYSTEM

02:10:49.975 --> 02:10:51.109
IS ARE WE INSURING THAT PEOPLE

02:10:51.176 --> 02:10:53.345
HAVE YOU KNOW A PLACE TO LIVE A

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:54.680
PLACE TO HEAL AND PEOPLE AT

02:10:54.746 --> 02:10:56.181
THEIR CONNECTED.

02:10:56.248 --> 02:10:56.882
TO AND SO I THINK WE'VE

02:10:56.949 --> 02:10:58.183
DEMONSTRATED TODAY THAT THERE'S

02:10:58.250 --> 02:10:59.451
QUITE A BIT OF DIVERSITY IN THE

02:10:59.518 --> 02:11:00.719
TYPE OF SERVICES WERE PROVIDING

02:11:00.786 --> 02:11:02.154
IN BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SO WHEN I

02:11:02.221 --> 02:11:03.455

NOT ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN

02:12:56.368 --> 02:12:57.135
THEIR SORT OF LINE WHERE THEY

02:12:57.202 --> 02:12:59.404
TALK ABOUT CONSUMER SATISFACTION

02:12:59.471 --> 02:13:00.138
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF TRENDING

02:13:00.205 --> 02:13:01.840
DOWN ON THAT IT'S MORE FEEDBACK

02:13:01.907 --> 02:13:03.542
ABOUT ON IMPROVING TIMELINESS TO

02:13:03.608 --> 02:13:05.811
SERVICES AT TIMES --

02:13:05.877 --> 02:13:07.612
BUT WHEN WE DO OUR LONG CONSUMER

02:13:07.679 --> 02:13:10.716
PERCEPTION SERVICES LIKE THIRTY

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:14.453
FIVE QUESTIONS --

02:13:14.519 --> 02:13:16.221
ITS A LOT AROUND TRANSPORTATION

02:13:16.288 --> 02:13:17.222

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:18.857
CONNECTEDNESS WHEN I WAS LOOKING

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:19.991
OUR MOST RECENT RESULTS WE

02:13:20.058 --> 02:13:21.860
PERFORMED REALLY WELL ON YOUR

02:13:21.927 --> 02:13:23.462
FAMILY SAYING MY CHILD GOT ALL

02:13:23.528 --> 02:13:24.629
THE SERVICES THEY NEEDED WHEN

02:13:24.696 --> 02:13:27.833
THEY NEEDED THEM --

02:13:27.899 --> 02:13:28.367
BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:13:28.433 --> 02:13:30.969
FINDINGS THAT WE SEE.

02:13:31.036 --> 02:13:33.071
SO THESE OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE.

02:13:33.138 --> 02:13:36.041
OKAY OKAY THERE MY JUST ANSWER

02:13:36.108 --> 02:13:36.641
MY OWN QUESTION HERE SORRY IT

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:38.977
HAPPENED.

02:13:39.044 --> 02:13:41.913
DOCTOR DIRECTOR CAN --

02:13:41.980 --> 02:13:44.916
SO NGUYEN IMAGE WHEN MHP SUBMIT

02:13:44.983 --> 02:13:46.518
BEEN BENEFICIARY STE

02:13:46.585 --> 02:13:49.721
SATISFACTION SURVEY AND WHEN WE

02:13:49.788 --> 02:13:51.590
DID GO OUT TO THE COUNTIES FOR

02:13:51.656 --> 02:13:53.091
THE TRI IN DEALS --

02:13:53.158 --> 02:13:54.760
WE LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF BOTH

02:13:54.826 --> 02:13:56.395
ADMINISTRATIVE DATA AS WELL AS

02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:58.163
KIND OF SOME OF THE QUALITATIVE

02:13:58.230 --> 02:13:59.965
DATA I THINK THAT --

02:14:00.031 --> 02:14:01.400
THE CONSUMER --

02:14:01.466 --> 02:14:03.101
RESPONSES AND FEEDBACK ARE PART

02:14:03.168 --> 02:14:05.303
OF AN OVERALL --

02:14:05.370 --> 02:14:06.204
YOU KNOW A WE MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:06.271 --> 02:14:07.873
THEY'RE DOING THE SURVEYS YOU

02:14:07.939 --> 02:14:08.840
KNOW JUST FROM THAT YOU KNOW

02:14:08.907 --> 02:14:09.975
CHECK IN THE BOX MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:11.109
IT'S BEING DONE.

02:14:11.176 --> 02:14:12.644
BUT I THINK WHAT WE LOOK FOR IN

02:14:12.711 --> 02:14:13.845
THE DOCUMENTATION WITH THE

02:14:13.912 --> 02:14:15.547
COUNTIES IS THE IS THE FEEDBACK

02:14:15.614 --> 02:14:16.882
THAT THEY'RE GETTING SOMEHOW

02:14:16.948 --> 02:14:18.316
EITHER INCORPORATED --

02:14:18.383 --> 02:14:19.885
I KNOW THAT WE HAVE HAD COUNTIES

02:14:19.951 --> 02:14:21.853
WHERE THEY HAVE IDENTIFIED

02:14:21.920 --> 02:14:25.424
THROUGH THEIR SURVEYS --

02:14:25.490 --> 02:14:26.358
GAPS -- FOR

02:14:26.425 --> 02:14:27.993
MAYBE L. G. B. T. POPULATIONS

02:14:28.059 --> 02:14:29.327
FEELING THAT THEY DON'T HAVE YOU

02:14:29.394 --> 02:14:30.662
KNOW THE RIGHT TYPE OF PROVIDER

02:14:30.729 --> 02:14:31.863
IN THAT COUNTY OR SOMETHING AND

02:14:31.930 --> 02:14:34.132
THEN WHEN WE DO THE TRIENNIAL WE

02:14:34.199 --> 02:14:35.500
WOULD BOTH KNOW THAT AS A SURVEY

02:14:35.567 --> 02:14:37.035
RESPONSE BUT THEN ALSO NOTE THAT

02:14:37.102 --> 02:14:38.703
THE COUNTY HAD DONE SOMETHING TO

02:14:38.770 --> 02:14:39.004
EFFECTUATE.

02:14:39.070 --> 02:14:40.372
A CHANGE IN THAT AREA SO

02:14:40.439 --> 02:14:42.641
SOMETIMES IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

02:14:42.707 --> 02:14:44.075
REACTING TO THE SURVEY ITSELF IS

02:14:44.142 --> 02:14:44.976
IS IT'S LOOKING INTO THE

02:14:45.043 --> 02:14:47.012
COUNTIES PROCESS THAT THEY

02:14:47.078 --> 02:14:48.480
INCORPORATED IT AND SOMEHOW

02:14:48.547 --> 02:14:50.015
ADDRESS IT IN A WAY THAT.

02:14:50.081 --> 02:14:50.882
IF IT COULD BE MEANINGFULLY

02:14:50.949 --> 02:14:51.850
ADDRESS THEN THAT WOULD

02:14:51.917 --> 02:14:52.717
CERTAINLY BE SOMETHING THAT WE

02:14:52.784 --> 02:14:54.486
WOULD TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AND AND

02:14:54.553 --> 02:14:55.754
IT WOULDN'T BE A SIGNIFICANT

02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:57.656
FINDING SO WHEN WE DO --

02:14:57.722 --> 02:15:00.292
KIND OF SYSTEM --

02:15:00.358 --> 02:15:02.060
REVIEWS WE NOT ONLY GO IN AND

02:15:02.127 --> 02:15:03.128
LOOK AT LIKE DID YOU FILL THE

02:15:03.195 --> 02:15:04.196
CHART OUT DOES IT HAVE THE

02:15:04.262 --> 02:15:06.298
PATIENCE SIGNATURE DO YOU HAVE

02:15:06.364 --> 02:15:07.532
THE RIGHT CODE YOU KNOW DID YOU

02:15:07.599 --> 02:15:09.067
MAKE THE RIGHT NOTE FOR THAT

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.135
PARTICULAR DAY BUT WHEN WE LOOK

02:15:10.202 --> 02:15:11.536
AT THE OVERALL SYSTEM.

02:15:11.603 --> 02:15:12.637
WE'RE LOOKING AT A KIND OF A

02:15:12.704 --> 02:15:18.276
BROAD PERSPECTIVE AS BOTH.

02:15:18.343 --> 02:15:20.879
BENEFICIARY FEEDBACK --

02:15:20.946 --> 02:15:22.981
YOU KNOW OVERALL COMPLIANCE YOUR

02:15:23.048 --> 02:15:24.049
APPEALS AND GRIEVANCES SO

02:15:24.115 --> 02:15:25.116
SOMETIMES IF THE COUNTY HAD FOR

02:15:25.183 --> 02:15:26.151
EXAMPLE A LOT OF APPEALS AND

02:15:26.218 --> 02:15:27.752
GRIEVANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE

02:15:27.819 --> 02:15:28.887
TO US THAT BENEFITS YEARS I'M

02:15:28.954 --> 02:15:30.489
HAPPY BECAUSE FOR THEM TO

02:15:30.555 --> 02:15:31.690
ACTUALLY GET INTO AN APPEAL

02:15:31.756 --> 02:15:33.091
GRIEVANCE PERIOD THAT WOULD SEE

02:15:33.158 --> 02:15:33.425
THAT.

02:15:33.492 --> 02:15:34.426
YOU WOULD SEE THAT THERE'S

02:15:34.493 --> 02:15:36.161
SOMETHING WRONG THERE SO THEN WE

02:15:36.228 --> 02:15:37.462
WOULD GO BACK TO THE SURVEY DATA

02:15:37.529 --> 02:15:38.964
AND SAY WHAT'S THE PROBLEM AND

02:15:39.030 --> 02:15:40.098
IF YOU SAW THE SURVEY DATA THAT

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:41.299
THE PATIENT WAS SAYING.

02:15:41.366 --> 02:15:42.501
YOU KNOW THERE'S NOT ENOUGH

02:15:42.567 --> 02:15:44.736
CLINICS AVAILABLE AND THE TIME

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:45.937
THEY WILL THAT SOMETHING THAT

02:15:46.004 --> 02:15:47.205
WOULD OBVIOUSLY LEAD THEM TO

02:15:47.272 --> 02:15:48.740
HAVE SO THOSE ARE THE WAYS IN

02:15:48.807 --> 02:15:50.709
WHICH WE WOULD USE THE DATA --

02:15:50.775 --> 02:15:52.177
AND THE RESPONSES THAT KIND OF

02:15:52.244 --> 02:15:53.945
LEADS US TO OTHER PARTS OF THEIR

02:15:54.012 --> 02:15:56.681
OVERALL OPERATION TO SAY IS THIS

02:15:56.748 --> 02:15:58.383
BROKEN OR CAN IT BE IMPROVED.

02:15:58.450 --> 02:15:59.718
SO YOU USING THE INFORMATION

02:15:59.784 --> 02:16:02.053
THAT'S GENERATED BY THE COUNTIES

02:16:02.120 --> 02:16:03.855
AND EVALUATING THAT YEAH ARCHERY

02:16:03.922 --> 02:16:08.860
AND YELLS WE'RE ON SITE.

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:09.861
FOR THREE TO SO YOU HAVE FIVE

02:16:09.928 --> 02:16:10.495
THREE TO FIVE DAYS DEPENDING ON

02:16:10.562 --> 02:16:11.496
THE SIZE OF THE COUNTY WITH THE

02:16:11.563 --> 02:16:13.164
TEAM SO WE ACTUALLY ARE IN THE

02:16:13.231 --> 02:16:15.333
COUNTY LOOKING AND TALKING AND

02:16:15.400 --> 02:16:16.468
GOING OUT TO PROVIDERS OFFICES

02:16:16.535 --> 02:16:17.702
AND DOING SHARPLES AND THINGS

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:19.004
LIKE THAT SO IT'S A PRETTY

02:16:19.070 --> 02:16:19.905
EXTENSIVE REVIEW WHICH IS.

02:16:19.971 --> 02:16:21.640
WHY THEY'RE TRY ANY ELSE WHICH

02:16:21.706 --> 02:16:23.241
IS WE DO A THIRD OF THE COUNTIES

02:16:23.308 --> 02:16:25.076
IN ONE YEAR A THIRD OF THE

02:16:25.143 --> 02:16:25.677
COUNTIES THE NEXT YEAR AND A

02:16:25.744 --> 02:16:26.478
THIRD OF THE COUNTIES?

02:16:26.545 --> 02:16:27.679
SO WE'VE GOT ROTATING BECAUSE IT

02:16:27.746 --> 02:16:30.148
IS -- LABOR

02:16:30.215 --> 02:16:32.384
INTENSIVE TYPE BEFORE CLASS.

02:16:32.450 --> 02:16:35.053
IS OVER THERE TOP LIKE A TOP THE

02:16:35.120 --> 02:16:37.956
TOP THREE STATEWIDE.

02:16:38.023 --> 02:16:40.692
OR OR WHAT THE TOP IT FROM YOUR

02:16:40.759 --> 02:16:42.127
PERSPECTIVE ONE OF THE TOP

02:16:42.193 --> 02:16:45.664
ISSUES THAT YOU SEE CONSISTENTLY --

02:16:45.730 --> 02:16:48.800
I WOULD.

02:16:48.867 --> 02:16:50.535
I WOULD SAY AND PSYCHIATRY

02:16:50.602 --> 02:16:51.970

02:16:54.105 --> 02:16:55.974
IF YOU TALK TO ANYONE --

02:16:56.041 --> 02:16:56.841
ANYWHERE THEY WILL SAY CHILD

02:16:56.908 --> 02:16:57.909
PSYCHIATRISTS ARE ONE OF HE

02:16:57.976 --> 02:16:59.844
MOST DIFFICULT PROVIDERS --

02:16:59.911 --> 02:17:00.912
TO ATTAIN --

02:17:00.979 --> 02:17:02.414
THEY ARE NOT --

02:17:02.480 --> 02:17:06.618
NECESSARILY DEEPLY AN HEALTH

02:17:06.685 --> 02:17:08.453
CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS NOR THEY

02:17:08.520 --> 02:17:10.322
ACTUALLY INVOLVED AND PRIVATE

02:17:10.388 --> 02:17:12.157
COMMERCIAL INSURANCE --

02:17:12.223 --> 02:17:13.391
THAT MUCH SO THERE IT

02:17:13.458 --> 02:17:17.529
EXCESSIVELY HARD TO GET --

02:17:17.596 --> 02:17:18.830
AND THAT'S CONCERNING OBVIOUSLY

02:17:18.897 --> 02:17:20.699
FROM A FROM A ADMINISTRATORS

02:17:20.765 --> 02:17:22.267
PERSPECTIVE WHICH IS IF YOU WANT

02:17:22.334 --> 02:17:23.735
TO TALK ABOUT CHILDREN AND HOW

02:17:23.802 --> 02:17:27.138
DO YOU TRY TO PREVENT --

02:17:27.205 --> 02:17:28.607
MENTAL ILLNESS FROM PROGRESSING --

02:17:28.673 --> 02:17:30.408
PROGRESSING TO A MORE SEVERE

02:17:30.475 --> 02:17:31.710
FORM -- THE

02:17:31.776 --> 02:17:33.211
FACT THAT WE DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH

02:17:33.278 --> 02:17:35.714
CHILD PSYCHIATRIST IN THE STATE --

02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:37.282
IS A IS A DEEPLY CONCERNING AN

02:17:37.349 --> 02:17:38.984
ISSUE FOR US --

02:17:39.050 --> 02:17:40.085
I THINK TRANSPORTATION WAS

02:17:40.151 --> 02:17:41.319
CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT HAS

02:17:41.386 --> 02:17:43.788
ALWAYS CONSISTENTLY COME UP --

02:17:43.855 --> 02:17:45.657
WHICH IN SOME CASES WE ARE

02:17:45.724 --> 02:17:47.492
HOPING WE SOFTEN WE DIRECTED

02:17:47.559 --> 02:17:48.593
THAT MANAGED CARE PLANS TO PAY

02:17:48.660 --> 02:17:49.961
FOR TRANSPORTATION FOR MEDI CAL

02:17:50.028 --> 02:17:51.196
BENEFICIARIES REGARDLESS OF

02:17:51.262 --> 02:17:52.364
WHETHER THE PLAN IS PAYING FOR

02:17:52.430 --> 02:17:53.498
THE SERVICE OR NOT.

02:17:53.565 --> 02:17:54.866
SO -- ARE

02:17:54.933 --> 02:17:56.468
MANAGED CARE PLANS ARE TWENTY

02:17:56.534 --> 02:17:57.469
FOUR CONTRACTING MEDICAL MANAGED

02:17:57.535 --> 02:17:59.304
CARE PLANS HAVE TO PAY FOR

02:17:59.371 --> 02:18:00.872
TRANSPORTATION FOR MEDI CAL

02:18:00.939 --> 02:18:02.140
BENEFICIARIES FOR THEIR COVERED

02:18:02.207 --> 02:18:04.175
ENROLLEES. TO SERVICES WHETHER

02:18:04.242 --> 02:18:05.877
OR NOT THE PLAN IS ACTUALLY PAID

02:18:05.944 --> 02:18:07.045
FOR THOSE SO.

02:18:07.112 --> 02:18:08.847
SPECIAL TO MENTAL HEALTH CARE

02:18:08.913 --> 02:18:12.083
DENTAL CCS --

02:18:12.150 --> 02:18:13.318
YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE THE PLANTS

02:18:13.385 --> 02:18:14.686
ARE NOT RESPONSIBLE AND THAT WAS

02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:17.822
OUR WAY OF TRYING TO ADDRESS

02:18:17.889 --> 02:18:18.456
SOMETHING THAT WE THOUGHT WAS A

02:18:18.523 --> 02:18:19.624
GAP -- I

02:18:19.691 --> 02:18:21.626
THINK OTHER THAN THAT I THINK --

02:18:21.693 --> 02:18:24.496
CRISIS STABILIZATION CRISIS AND

02:18:24.562 --> 02:18:26.898
HAS CONTINUE TO BE AN AREA IN

02:18:26.965 --> 02:18:30.035
WHICH MORE CAN BE DONE --

02:18:30.101 --> 02:18:31.436
PRIMARILY BECAUSE IT COMES IN A

02:18:31.503 --> 02:18:34.539
TIME IN WHICH THE HEALTHCARE

02:18:34.606 --> 02:18:36.307
DELIVERY SYSTEM IS NOT ALWAYS

02:18:36.374 --> 02:18:38.176
KNOWN FOR BEING AVAILABLE YOU

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:40.545
KNOW ON A ON A TIME IN WHICH

02:18:40.612 --> 02:18:41.846
THAT SYNCS UP NATURALLY WITH

02:18:41.913 --> 02:18:43.782
WHEN YOU'RE PEAK CRISIS SEES

02:18:43.848 --> 02:18:45.116
USUALLY INVOLVE WHICH IS.

02:18:45.183 --> 02:18:47.052
TYPICALLY AT NIGHT --

02:18:47.118 --> 02:18:49.721
TYPICALLY ON THE WEEKENDS AND SO --

02:18:49.788 --> 02:18:51.256
COUNTIES ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE

02:18:51.322 --> 02:18:52.424
CRISIS SERVICES BUT NOT

02:18:52.490 --> 02:18:53.925
NECESSARILY THEY'RE NOT REQUIRED

02:18:53.992 --> 02:18:55.527
TO HAVE MOBILE CRISIS SERVICES

02:18:55.593 --> 02:18:56.094
THAT'S UP TO THE COUNTY TO

02:18:56.161 --> 02:18:57.028
DECIDE.

02:18:57.095 --> 02:18:58.129
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY GIVEN THE

02:18:58.196 --> 02:18:59.964
RURAL OR URBAN NATURE OF A

02:19:00.031 --> 02:19:01.866
COUNTY THAT CAN BE --

02:19:01.933 --> 02:19:03.435
MORE DIFFICULT AND I KNOW THAT

02:19:03.501 --> 02:19:04.502
SHASTA HAS CERTAINLY BEEN

02:19:04.569 --> 02:19:07.138
PILOTING A NEW MOBILE CRISIS --

02:19:07.205 --> 02:19:08.840
UNIT THAT HAS A SEEM TO GO VERY

02:19:08.907 --> 02:19:11.443
WELL BUT THOSE ARE SOME OF THE

02:19:11.509 --> 02:19:12.310
THREE THAT IF I HAD A NAME THREE

02:19:12.377 --> 02:19:13.244
THOSE WOULD BE THE TOP THREE

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:16.047
THAT WERE MOST AWARE OF AND AND

02:19:16.114 --> 02:19:18.483
SENSITIVE.

02:19:18.550 --> 02:19:21.286
TO OTHER TYPES OR I MEAN --

02:19:21.352 --> 02:19:23.888
HOW MANY HOW MANY OR WHAT TYPES

02:19:23.955 --> 02:19:26.825
OF ISSUES AND A LEADING CALLS TO

02:19:26.891 --> 02:19:30.195
THE OMBUDSMAN FOR EXAMPLE --

02:19:30.261 --> 02:19:32.330
IT USUALLY IS --

02:19:32.397 --> 02:19:33.698
AROUND.

02:19:33.765 --> 02:19:34.199
ALL OF THE CALLS TO THE

02:19:34.265 --> 02:19:36.367
OMBUDSMAN CAN BE --

02:19:36.434 --> 02:19:38.870
YES CAN BE CERTAINLY DIVERT

02:19:38.937 --> 02:19:40.438
STANDING OF WHAT --

02:19:40.505 --> 02:19:42.173
THE BENEFIT IS --

02:19:42.240 --> 02:19:43.608
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LIKE THE

02:19:43.675 --> 02:19:45.043
PROVIDER --

02:19:45.110 --> 02:19:46.010
SO THEY HAVE A COMPLAINT ABOUT

02:19:46.077 --> 02:19:47.312
THE SPECIFIC PROVIDER LIKE THEY

02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:49.247
WERE RUDE TO ME OR THE OFFICE

02:19:49.314 --> 02:19:51.216
STAFF WOULDN'T RETURNMY CALLS --

02:19:51.282 --> 02:19:53.418
SOMETIMES THEY DON'T LIKE THE

02:19:53.485 --> 02:19:55.787
NATURE OF THE SERVICE THAT HAS

02:19:55.854 --> 02:19:57.188
BEEN --

02:19:57.255 --> 02:19:59.190
DETERMINED APPROPRIATE FOR THEM

02:19:59.257 --> 02:20:03.261
SO IF THEY SOMETIMES IF IT'S A A

02:20:03.328 --> 02:20:04.496
PARENT THAT THINKS THEIR CHILD

02:20:04.562 --> 02:20:05.997
NEEDS A RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT

02:20:06.064 --> 02:20:07.565
AND THE ASSESSMENT IS DONE AT

02:20:07.632 --> 02:20:08.566
THE COUNTY LEVEL IN THE COUNTY

02:20:08.633 --> 02:20:10.802
SAYS THIS IS NOT A THIS IS NOT

02:20:10.869 --> 02:20:12.370
AN INDIVIDUAL THAT IS NEEDING.

02:20:12.437 --> 02:20:14.072
A RESIDENTIAL PLACEMENT --

02:20:14.139 --> 02:20:15.607
YOU'LL HEAR FROM THE ON YOU KNOW

02:20:15.673 --> 02:20:16.508
YOU'LL GET A CALL IN TO THE

02:20:16.574 --> 02:20:18.343
OMBUDSMAN SAYING I DISAGREE --

02:20:18.409 --> 02:20:19.344
MORE OFTEN THAN THAT IS A

02:20:19.411 --> 02:20:22.247
USUALLY A LACK OF UNDERSTANDING

02:20:22.313 --> 02:20:23.448
IN TERMS OF WHERE DO I GO AND

02:20:23.515 --> 02:20:25.216
HOW DO I GET SERVICES WHICH YOU

02:20:25.283 --> 02:20:26.551
KNOW AS I SAID AT THE BEGINNING

02:20:26.618 --> 02:20:29.521
OF MY REMARKS TODAY WE RUN SIX

02:20:29.587 --> 02:20:31.656
DELIVERY [inaudible]

02:20:31.723 --> 02:20:35.727
EVERYONE I THINK WE ARE DEEPLY --

02:20:35.794 --> 02:20:37.295
COMMITTED TO TRYING TO MAKE THAT

02:20:37.362 --> 02:20:38.797
MORE --

02:20:38.863 --> 02:20:40.131
SEAMLESS FOR INDIVIDUALS

02:20:40.198 --> 02:20:42.100
ESPECIALLY THOSE THAT HAVE --

02:20:42.167 --> 02:20:43.501
MENTAL HEALTH OR SUBSTANCE USE

02:20:43.568 --> 02:20:44.736
DISORDER I MEAN THAT IS A REALLY

02:20:44.803 --> 02:20:46.571
DIFFICULT THING TO TRY TO

02:20:46.638 --> 02:20:48.840
NAVIGATE ON THEIR OWN AND SO --

02:20:48.907 --> 02:20:49.541
THAT'S USUALLY WHAT THE

02:20:49.607 --> 02:20:50.942
OMBUDSMAN IS DEALING WITH THIS

02:20:51.009 --> 02:20:51.976
PEOPLE THAT THEY'RE JUST SIMPLY

02:20:52.043 --> 02:20:53.211
ACTION NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS

02:20:53.278 --> 02:20:54.913
AVAILABLE TO THEM AND BY WHICH

02:20:54.979 --> 02:20:57.282
SYSTEM --

02:20:57.348 --> 02:20:58.383
HOW HOW TO HOW TO OUR

02:20:58.449 --> 02:21:00.185
PENETRATION RATES MATCH UP WITH

02:21:00.251 --> 02:21:01.186
PREVALENCE AND?

02:21:01.252 --> 02:21:07.292
HAS A VERY BY COUNTY OBVIOUSLY --

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:09.060
I WILL HAVE TO TAKE A LIFELINE

02:21:09.127 --> 02:21:10.395
ON THAT ONE BECAUSE OUR

02:21:10.461 --> 02:21:12.564
PENETRATION RATES I KNOW FROM A

02:21:12.630 --> 02:21:14.566
STATEWIDE --

02:21:14.632 --> 02:21:16.234
PERSPECTIVE BUT I DON'T KNOW

02:21:16.301 --> 02:21:18.570
FROM MY COUNTY PERSPECTIVE WHAT

02:21:18.636 --> 02:21:19.871
ARE THEY STATEWIDE --

02:21:19.938 --> 02:21:21.039
THEY'RE ABOUT THE SAME FOR BOTH

02:21:21.105 --> 02:21:22.106
PEDIATRIC AND ADULT THE

02:21:22.173 --> 02:21:24.742
PENETRATION RATES ABOUT 4% GIVE

02:21:24.809 --> 02:21:25.743
OR TAKE.

02:21:25.810 --> 02:21:26.377
POINT -- ONE

02:21:26.444 --> 02:21:29.480
POINT TWO ONE ON EITHER SIDE --

02:21:29.547 --> 02:21:30.548
I KNOW THAT --

02:21:30.615 --> 02:21:32.250
THE PENETRATION RATE FOR

02:21:32.317 --> 02:21:34.919
CHILDREN HAS BEEN A CONCERN --

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:36.254
FROM THE ADVOCATE CERTAINLY OVER

02:21:36.321 --> 02:21:37.355
THE LAST FEW YEARS AND THAT THEY

02:21:37.422 --> 02:21:38.990
FELT LIKE THE PENETRATION RATE

02:21:39.057 --> 02:21:40.925
SHOULD BE HIGHER --

02:21:40.992 --> 02:21:44.028
BUT JUST FROM THE STAND LATER

02:21:44.095 --> 02:21:45.330
AND OUR DENOMINATOR HAVE GROWN

02:21:45.396 --> 02:21:47.398
BOTH YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE GOT A

02:21:47.465 --> 02:21:48.766
SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHILDREN

02:21:48.833 --> 02:21:50.735
IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THAT WORD

02:21:50.802 --> 02:21:53.504
NOT PREVIOUSLY AND SO --

02:21:53.571 --> 02:21:55.106
I TEND TO THINK THAT IT'S

02:21:55.173 --> 02:21:57.308
ACTUALLY PROBABLY REFLECTIVE OF

02:21:57.375 --> 02:21:59.577
THAT YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN A VERY

02:21:59.644 --> 02:22:01.212
KIND OF STABLE NUMBER BOTH PRE

02:22:01.279 --> 02:22:03.147
AND POST ACA BUT IT'S ALSO

02:22:03.214 --> 02:22:03.948
REFLECTIVE OF WHAT THE

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:05.216
PENETRATION RATE IS ON THE ADULT

02:22:05.283 --> 02:22:08.653
SIDE WHICH YOU KNOW TO THE

02:22:08.720 --> 02:22:09.954
PRESENTATION BY C. H. C. F..

02:22:10.021 --> 02:22:12.190
WE KNOW KIND OF THE GENERAL

02:22:12.257 --> 02:22:14.659
POPULATION HAS THIS PERCENTAGE

02:22:14.726 --> 02:22:16.261
OF SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND

02:22:16.327 --> 02:22:18.229
BECAUSE IT'S A CHRONIC DISEASE

02:22:18.296 --> 02:22:19.063
AND SO THEREFORE WE WOULDN'T

02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:21.065
NECESSARILY EXPECT THERE TO BE A

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:23.101
HUGE SPIKE IN PENETRATION.

02:22:23.167 --> 02:22:24.335
BASED ON SPECIALTY MENTAL HEALTH

02:22:24.402 --> 02:22:26.504
SERVICES DUE TO A SERIOUS MENTAL

02:22:26.571 --> 02:22:28.806
ILLNESS JUST BECAUSE THAT IS NOT

02:22:28.873 --> 02:22:31.843
NECESSARILY A GROWING --

02:22:31.910 --> 02:22:32.677
A GROWING --

02:22:32.744 --> 02:22:34.812
DIAGNOSIS OR DISEASE STATE I

02:22:34.879 --> 02:22:36.547
THINK WHAT HAS BEEN GROWING AS

02:22:36.614 --> 02:22:38.383
AN INTEREST IN IDENTIFYING

02:22:38.449 --> 02:22:39.984
CHILDREN WITH BEHAVIORAL ISSUES

02:22:40.051 --> 02:22:41.552
EARLIER AND DOING AN

02:22:41.619 --> 02:22:43.221
INTERVENTION EARLIER AND SAID

02:22:43.288 --> 02:22:44.689
THAT IS CERTAINLY AND BUT THAT'S

02:22:44.756 --> 02:22:46.090
DIFFERENT THAN A DIAGNOSIS WITH

02:22:46.157 --> 02:22:47.191
THE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS AND

02:22:47.258 --> 02:22:47.725
SO.

02:22:47.792 --> 02:22:48.760
THAT'S REALLY WHERE A LOT OF

02:22:48.826 --> 02:22:50.028
ATTENTION HAS BEEN PAID BOTH ON

02:22:50.094 --> 02:22:52.330
THE COUNTY SIDE AS WELL AS ON

02:22:52.397 --> 02:22:53.398
THE ADVOCATE SIDE WHICH IS HOW

02:22:53.464 --> 02:22:54.532
DO WE GET TO KIDS.

02:22:54.599 --> 02:22:56.000
AND TRY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH

02:22:56.067 --> 02:22:58.202
SERVICES PRIOR TO THEM BEING

02:22:58.269 --> 02:22:59.070
DIAGNOSED WITH A SERIOUS MENTAL

02:22:59.137 --> 02:23:03.808
ILLNESS IF IF AT ALL POSSIBLE SO.

02:23:03.875 --> 02:23:04.375
IT'S JUST SO IMPORTANT TO

02:23:04.442 --> 02:23:06.010
REMEMBER HOW MUCH OF A CHANGE IT

02:23:06.077 --> 02:23:07.245
WAS WITH A CA RIGHT THE

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:08.179
POPULATION JUST ONE UP SO MUCH

02:23:08.246 --> 02:23:09.747
MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATED SO I

02:23:09.814 --> 02:23:11.215
THINK THAT'S YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE

02:23:11.282 --> 02:23:12.517
A GOOD JOB IN COLLABORATION WITH

02:23:12.583 --> 02:23:13.451
DH CS YOU KNOW KEEPING THE

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:14.285
PENETRATION RATE.

02:23:14.352 --> 02:23:16.054
STABLE AND NOT NOT LOSING GROUND

02:23:16.120 --> 02:23:17.989
BECAUSE FUNDING HASN'T
