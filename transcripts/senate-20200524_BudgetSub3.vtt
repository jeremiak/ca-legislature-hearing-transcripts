CALIFORNIA WHAT IS THE

00:31:46.170 --> 00:31:48.773
ADMINISTRATION PROPOSING GIVEN

00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:49.474

SITUATION- FUND A STATE FUNDS

00:31:52.210 --> 00:31:54.679
GOING TO THE FUTURE- FOR SOME

00:31:54.746 --> 00:31:55.947
OF THESE ACTIVITIES KNOWING

00:31:56.014 --> 00:31:57.548
THAT IT'S NOT GOING TO STOP ON

00:31:57.615 --> 00:32:00.351
JULY FIRST AND- WELL WE MAY NOT

BE ABLE TO SPEAK THE EXACT

00:32:01.619 --> 00:32:03.821
AMOUNT WE MAY NEED TO. THINK

00:32:03.888 --> 00:32:05.290
ABOUT WELL WE SHOULD BE

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.125
ALLOCATING AT LEAST SOME STATE

00:32:07.191 --> 00:32:10.695
FUNDS- AND- SINCE WE LOOKS LIKE

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:12.030
WE'RE STILL PAYING A QUARTER OF

00:32:12.096 --> 00:32:14.932
THE EXPENSES SO IS THAT IN THE-

00:32:14.999 --> 00:32:16.301
IS THAT SOMETHING THAT'S BEING

00:32:16.367 --> 00:32:18.169
PROPOSED AND THAT MAY REVISE

00:32:18.236 --> 00:32:20.071
OUR AS AN INSPIRATION TO

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:21.139
SUPPORTING COMING BACK TO THE

LEGISLATURE FOR THAT- FOR

00:32:22.940 --> 00:32:24.542
FUNDING REQUESTS FOR MS

00:32:24.609 --> 00:32:25.343
ACTIVITIES RELATED TO

00:32:25.410 --> 00:32:34.786
PREPARATION. FOR A COVETED. BUT

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:36.087
WHAT WE HAVE DONE THIS WORK

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.122
TRUST WITH THEM SO WE HAVE NO

00:32:38.189 --> 00:32:41.159
MAJOR REVISION PROPOSALS THAT.

ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AT THIS

00:32:43.961 --> 00:32:47.231
TIME. OKAY SO I DO UNDERSTAND

00:32:47.298 --> 00:32:49.267
THAT- I THINK THE IN THE

00:32:49.334 --> 00:32:50.635
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THERE'S A

00:32:50.702 --> 00:32:53.438
PROPOSAL FOR A GENERAL POOL OF

00:32:53.504 --> 00:32:55.206
MONEY IN RESPONSE TO COVET BUT

00:32:55.273 --> 00:32:56.641
ME FRANKLY SOME OF THESE ARE

00:32:56.708 --> 00:32:59.844
THINGS THAT WE CAN ANTICIPATE-

00:32:59.911 --> 00:33:01.479
AND THEY SAID YES WE'LL HAVE TO

00:33:01.546 --> 00:33:02.547
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON WHAT

00:33:02.613 --> 00:33:04.916
HAPPENS AND DALE CASELOAD AND

00:33:04.982 --> 00:33:06.017
WE HAVE A SECOND SERVES AND SO

00:33:06.084 --> 00:33:07.985
FORTH. BUT FOR IT YOU KNOW WE

00:33:08.052 --> 00:33:09.687
KNOW THAT- AS WE'RE GETTING

00:33:09.754 --> 00:33:11.522
FUNDS FROM THE FEDERAL

00:33:11.589 --> 00:33:13.491
GOVERNMENT- IF THEY'RE COVERING

00:33:13.558 --> 00:33:15.159
THE MAXIMUM 75% WE STILL HAVE

00:33:15.226 --> 00:33:16.060
TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO FUND THE

00:33:16.127 --> 00:33:19.063
REMAINING. 25% AND CERTAINLY- I

00:33:19.130 --> 00:33:20.665
THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO

00:33:20.732 --> 00:33:21.833
BE ENGAGED IN THAT DISCUSSION

00:33:21.899 --> 00:33:23.935
ABOUT HOW WE CAN APPROPRIATELY

00:33:24.001 --> 00:33:26.070
ALLOCATE OUR STATE FUNDS IN A

00:33:26.137 --> 00:33:27.872
WAY THAT ALLOWS US TO ADDRESS

00:33:27.939 --> 00:33:30.441
THECODE- PANDEMIC BUT ALSO OF

00:33:30.508 --> 00:33:32.276
COURSE- PRIORITIZE THAT VARIOUS

00:33:32.343 --> 00:33:34.612
OTHER. EXPENDITURES THAT WERE

YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.950
AS WELL SO- YEAH I THINK HAVING

00:33:39.016 --> 00:33:41.352
THAT KIND OF DISCUSSION AND-

00:33:41.419 --> 00:33:42.420
GAUGE MEN CERTAINLY NOT ONLY ON

THINGS AS WELL. I THINK IT'S

00:33:45.823 --> 00:33:47.125
GOING TO BE VERY IMPORTANT SO

00:33:47.191 --> 00:33:50.661
THAT- OUR LEGISLATURE IS HERE

00:33:50.728 --> 00:33:52.330
YEAH IT IS INVOLVED AND NOW

00:33:52.397 --> 00:33:53.698

01:06:25.247 --> 01:06:28.551
P. E. CHANGING THE PROCEDURES-

01:06:28.617 --> 01:06:29.919
ACTUALLY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

01:07:15.331 --> 01:07:16.198
AND THE RECKLESS BUT FRAMEWORK

01:07:16.265 --> 01:07:19.235
ACTUALLY OFTEN WHAT WE DO IS WE

01:07:19.301 --> 01:07:20.069
IDENTIFY WHEN THERE'S A PROBLEM

01:07:20.136 --> 01:07:22.238
AND THEN. ACT FOR A CORRECTIVE

01:07:22.304 --> 01:07:24.774
ACTION PLAN OR SOME CONSEQUENCE

01:07:24.840 --> 01:07:26.041
TO THAT BUT WE NEED TO BE MORE

01:07:26.108 --> 01:07:28.944
PROACTIVE WE KNOW WHAT'S GOING

01:07:29.011 --> 01:07:31.847
ON RIGHT NOW SO. TO APPRECIATE

01:07:31.914 --> 01:07:32.648
THEIR YOU GOT THESE

01:07:32.715 --> 01:07:33.983
INFORMATIONAL FILINGS I

01:07:34.049 --> 01:07:35.117
APPRECIATE THAT MEANS THAT

01:07:35.184 --> 01:07:36.919
PLANTS HAVE TRIED TO COME UP

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:39.822

01:08:05.414 --> 01:08:06.916

KNOW WE CAN CERTAINLY RECONCILE

01:08:08.184 --> 01:08:10.152

THOSE PARTICULAR. ENTITIES

01:08:22.932 --> 01:08:23.999
THERE MIGHT BE SOME CONCERNS

01:08:24.066 --> 01:08:27.002
ABOUT RAPID PAYMENT BUT- MOST

01:08:27.069 --> 01:08:28.537
PROVIDERS DON'T FALL IN THAT

01:08:28.604 --> 01:08:33.776
CATEGORY AND- THEY'RE SUFFERING-CASH FLOW ISSUES OF THAT A

01:08:33.843 --> 01:08:35.177

INDIVIDUAL WHO'S BEEN ON THE

01:58:57.163 --> 01:58:59.131

PRESENTATIONS. I KNOW THAT

01:59:23.756 --> 01:59:24.690
THERE'S A LOT OF GROUND TO

01:59:24.757 --> 01:59:26.626
COVER- WITH THIS DEPARTMENT WE

01:59:26.692 --> 01:59:29.428
NORMALLY- I THINK TAKE TWO FULL

01:59:29.495 --> 01:59:31.931
HEARING DAYS TO HEAR DCS IN THE

01:59:31.998 --> 01:59:33.900

ANNA OUR CONTRACT. OR SO. LMAO

01:59:39.672 --> 01:59:45.111
COMMENTS. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU

01:59:45.177 --> 01:59:47.647
HEAR ME YES OKAY BEN JOHNSON

01:59:47.713 --> 01:59:49.282
WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S

01:59:49.348 --> 01:59:51.684
OFFICE AND- FIRST I'D LIKE TO

01:59:51.751 --> 01:59:53.686
TURN TO THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

01:59:53.753 --> 01:59:55.755
THE ADMINISTRATION AND OUR

01:59:55.821 --> 01:59:57.757
CASELOAD ESTIMATES- MISS COOPER

01:59:57.823 --> 01:59:59.692
DID A GREAT JOB OF JUST BRIEFLY

01:59:59.759 --> 02:00:00.826
SUMMARIZING THE MAJOR

02:00:00.893 --> 02:00:02.028
DIFFERENCES BUT I'D LIKE TO

02:00:02.094 --> 02:00:04.096
UNDERSCORE- THE SOME OF THE

02:00:04.163 --> 02:00:07.667
REASONS WHY WE QUESTION THE

02:00:07.733 --> 02:00:08.801
ASSUMPTIONS UNDER THE

02:00:08.868 --> 02:00:11.070
ADMINISTRATION'S PROJECTIONS SO

02:00:11.137 --> 02:00:13.606
AS AS MISS COOPER SAID WE ARE

02:00:13.673 --> 02:00:15.541
NOT FAR OFF AND WE REALLY DO

02:00:15.608 --> 02:00:16.976
THINK THAT THEIR OVERALL

02:00:17.043 --> 02:00:19.178
CASELOAD PROJECTIONS ARE IN

02:00:19.245 --> 02:00:20.580
TERMS OF NEW ENROLLEES ARE

02:00:20.646 --> 02:00:22.315
REASONABLE. BUT WHAT WE

02:00:22.381 --> 02:00:25.384
QUESTION IS- THE AMOUNT OF

02:00:25.451 --> 02:00:27.887
GENERAL FUND COSTS THAT THE

02:00:27.954 --> 02:00:32.158
STATE WOULD ACTUALLY ENCOURAGE.

02:00:32.224 --> 02:00:32.758
AS A RESULT OF THESE DO ENROLL

02:00:32.825 --> 02:00:34.126
THE- AND IT'S HERE THAT THE

02:00:34.193 --> 02:00:35.928
ADMINISTRATION ASSUMES THAT A

02:00:35.995 --> 02:00:37.763
VERY SIGNIFICANT SHARE OF THE

02:00:37.830 --> 02:00:40.166
NEW ENROLLEES- WOULD BE SENIORS

02:00:40.232 --> 02:00:42.101
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

02:00:42.168 --> 02:00:44.236
AND THESE DAYS INDIVIDUALS HAVE

02:00:44.303 --> 02:00:46.439
VERY HIGH COSTS OFTEN MORE THAN

02:00:46.505 --> 02:00:49.342
TEN TIMES. THE COST OF OTHER

02:00:49.408 --> 02:00:51.510
ENROLLEES IN THE PROGRAM UNDER

02:00:51.577 --> 02:00:55.448
THE ADMINISTRATION'S.

02:00:55.514 --> 02:00:56.382
PROJECTIONS SENIORS IN PERSON

02:00:56.449 --> 02:00:57.950
WITH THIS. WOULD GROW AT A

02:00:58.017 --> 02:01:00.953
ROUGHLY COMPARABLE RATE AS

02:01:01.020 --> 02:01:03.022
ANOTHER POT LARGE POPULATIONS

02:01:03.089 --> 02:01:04.757
THAT ARE THE THAT IS THE

02:01:04.824 --> 02:01:06.392
CHILDLESS ADULT POPULATION THAT

02:01:06.459 --> 02:01:08.227
HAS A LEGIBILITY THROUGH THE

02:01:08.294 --> 02:01:10.630
OPTIONAL EXPANSION. WE QUESTION

02:01:10.696 --> 02:01:12.665
THIS ASSUMPTION AS WE BELIEVE

02:01:12.732 --> 02:01:15.067
THAT THE CHILDLESS ADULTS HAVE

02:01:15.134 --> 02:01:17.236
R. WELL PARTICIPATE TOO MUCH

02:01:17.303 --> 02:01:18.804
GREATER EXTENT IN THE LABOR

02:01:18.871 --> 02:01:20.640
MARKET AND THEREFORE THERE ARE

02:01:20.706 --> 02:01:22.308
THAT ECONOMIC VIEW THAT THE

02:01:22.375 --> 02:01:23.876
CONDITIONS OF THOSE FAMILIES

02:01:23.943 --> 02:01:25.311
ARE FACING IN THEIR INCOMES ARE

02:01:25.378 --> 02:01:27.613
GOING TO VERY MUCH MORE. WITH

02:01:27.680 --> 02:01:29.215
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE ECONOMY

02:01:29.281 --> 02:01:31.117
THAN US SENIORS WHO MAY BE

02:01:31.183 --> 02:01:33.686
RETIRED AND- INDIVIDUALS WITH

02:01:33.753 --> 02:01:36.622
DISABILITIES WHO WHO MIGHT ONLY.

02:01:36.689 --> 02:01:40.326
MAY NOT WORK FULL TIME. AND SO

02:01:40.393 --> 02:01:42.428
WE BELIEVE THAT IN THAT. SOME

02:01:42.495 --> 02:01:44.764
OF THE SOON TO INDIVIDUALS THAT

02:01:44.830 --> 02:01:45.998
THE ADMINISTRATION IS PUTTING

02:01:46.065 --> 02:01:47.433
INTO THE SENIORS AND PERSONS

02:01:47.500 --> 02:01:49.669
WITH DISABILITIES- CASELOAD

02:01:49.735 --> 02:01:52.104
SHOULD REALLY BE SHIFTED TO A

02:01:52.171 --> 02:01:54.273
DIFFERENT KEESLER CATEGORY.

02:01:54.340 --> 02:01:56.842
SECOND WE FIND IS THAT- THE

02:01:56.909 --> 02:01:58.310
STATE- THE ADMINISTRATION

02:01:58.377 --> 02:01:59.879
ASSUMES THAT A VERY HIGH

02:01:59.945 --> 02:02:02.214
PROPORTION OF NEW ENROLLMENT

02:02:02.281 --> 02:02:04.750
WILL BE FROM- FROM INDIVIDUALS

02:02:04.817 --> 02:02:05.851
WHERE THE STATE PAYS A HIGH

02:02:05.918 --> 02:02:07.887
SHERIFF COST STATE PAYS A HIGH

02:02:07.953 --> 02:02:09.455
SHARE OF COSTS FOR FAMILIES AND

02:02:09.522 --> 02:02:11.290
CHILDREN. AND SENIORS AND

02:02:11.357 --> 02:02:12.858
PERSONS WITH DISABILITY BUT THE

02:02:12.925 --> 02:02:14.326
STATE PAYS QUITE A LOW SHARE OF

02:02:14.393 --> 02:02:16.095
COST FOR THESE DOES CHILDLESS

02:02:16.162 --> 02:02:17.296
ADULTS ARE SPEAKING IN

02:02:17.363 --> 02:02:21.300
PREVIOUSLY AS WELL AS CHILDREN

02:02:21.367 --> 02:02:21.901
FROM HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES.

02:02:21.967 --> 02:02:23.402
CURRENTLY THE CASELOAD IN MEDIC

02:02:23.469 --> 02:02:27.139
HOW- COMPRISE ABOUT 40% OF

02:02:27.206 --> 02:02:28.774
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE LOWER

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:31.177
STATE SHARE OF COST. BUT UNDER

02:02:31.243 --> 02:02:32.678
THE UNDER THE GUN UNDER THE

02:02:32.745 --> 02:02:34.246
ADMINISTRATION'S ASSUMPTIONS

02:02:34.313 --> 02:02:37.149
FOR NEW CASELOAD 80% OF NEW

02:02:37.216 --> 02:02:39.552
ENROLLEES WOULD- HAVE THE

02:02:39.618 --> 02:02:41.454
HIGHER STATE SHARE OF COST AND

02:02:41.520 --> 02:02:43.255
WE DON'T UNDERSTAND. WHY IT

02:02:43.322 --> 02:02:45.024
WOULD BE NECESSARILY SO

02:02:45.091 --> 02:02:46.859
DIFFERENT THAN THE CURRENT

02:02:46.926 --> 02:02:48.794
MEDICARE OKAY SO. MOREOVER WE

02:02:48.861 --> 02:02:50.830
HAVE LOOKED AT. SOME OF THE

02:02:50.896 --> 02:02:54.967
DATA ON- ON HOW MANY LOW INCOME

02:02:55.034 --> 02:02:57.203
PEOPLE OR ADULTS TEND TO HAVE

02:02:57.269 --> 02:02:58.771
CHILDREN WHICH IMPACTS WHETHER

02:02:58.838 --> 02:02:59.905
OR NOT THEY BE PUT IN THE

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:02.108
OPTIONAL EXPANSION CATEGORY OR

02:03:02.174 --> 02:03:04.043
IN THE FAMILY'S CATEGORY. AND

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:07.146
WE FIND THAT A MAJORITY ARE DO

02:03:07.213 --> 02:03:08.848
NOT HAVE YOUNG CHILDREN IN THE

02:03:08.914 --> 02:03:10.683
HOME AND THEREFORE WOULD LIKELY

02:03:10.750 --> 02:03:14.553
BE PUT INTO THE- CHILDLESS

02:03:14.620 --> 02:03:16.322
ADULT CATEGORY. SO THESE THESE-

02:03:16.388 --> 02:03:17.757
DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS HAVE A

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:20.292
MAJOR GENERAL FUND MPACT AND

02:03:20.359 --> 02:03:21.894
THEY INFORM WHY WE RECOMMEND

02:03:21.961 --> 02:03:23.395
ADJUSTING MEDI CAL BUDGET

02:03:23.462 --> 02:03:25.231
DOWNWARD BY SEVEN HUNDRED AND

02:03:25.297 --> 02:03:28.000
FIFTY MILLION ACROSS BOTH

02:03:28.067 --> 02:03:28.968
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AND

02:03:29.034 --> 02:03:31.170
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE'VE TRIED

02:03:31.237 --> 02:03:33.105
ISSUE AS CLOSELY AS POSSIBLE TO

02:03:33.172 --> 02:03:34.907
THE ADMINISTRATION'S GENERAL

02:03:34.974 --> 02:03:37.343
ASSUMPTIONS ONLY ADJUSTING

02:03:37.409 --> 02:03:39.278
REALLY WHERE SOME OF THE NEW

02:03:39.345 --> 02:03:41.380
CASELOAD- NEW INNOVATIVE NEW

02:03:41.447 --> 02:03:43.149
ENTRANTS INTO THE PROGRAM WOULD

02:03:43.215 --> 02:03:45.384
BE PLACED AMONG THE VARIOUS.

02:03:45.451 --> 02:03:47.553
CATEGORIES SO WE TRY TO DO OUR

02:03:47.620 --> 02:03:49.054
WE DO OUR BEST TO ASSUME

02:03:49.121 --> 02:03:50.990
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME COST PER

02:03:51.056 --> 02:03:54.460
CASE AS A AS THE ADMINISTRATION

02:03:54.527 --> 02:03:57.329
WOULD AT LEAST WITHIN THE

02:03:57.396 --> 02:03:58.764
CASELOAD CATEGORIES. WE HAVE

02:03:58.831 --> 02:04:00.666
RECOMMENDED ADJUSTMENT THE END

02:04:00.733 --> 02:04:01.500
THIS STILL INCLUDES A

02:04:01.567 --> 02:04:03.335
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SENIORS

02:04:03.402 --> 02:04:04.570
AND PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES

02:04:04.637 --> 02:04:06.472
AND ROLLING IN THE PROGRAM AND

02:04:06.539 --> 02:04:07.940
ITS STILL ASSUMES A

02:04:08.007 --> 02:04:10.009
DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE

02:04:10.075 --> 02:04:12.645
NEW ENTRANCE WOULD BE FAMILIES-

02:04:12.711 --> 02:04:14.780
AND CHILDREN AS OPPOSED TO THE

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:16.248
LESS EXPENSIVE CHILDLESS

02:04:16.315 --> 02:04:18.617
ADULTS. AS SUCH WE DO BELIEVE

02:04:18.684 --> 02:04:19.552
THAT I RECOMMENDED IT

02:04:19.618 --> 02:04:21.921
ADJUSTMENT IS CONSERVATIVE AND

02:04:21.987 --> 02:04:24.490
CAN WITHSTAND SOME OF THIS-

02:04:24.557 --> 02:04:25.624
PHYSICAL RISK THE STATE WOULD

02:04:25.691 --> 02:04:29.128
FACE SAY IS- NEW ENROLLMENT

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:31.330
WE'RE ACTUALLY EVEN HIGHER THAN

02:04:31.397 --> 02:04:36.168
WHAT THE. ADMINISTRATION IS

02:04:36.235 --> 02:04:38.237
PROJECTING. NOW I'D TURN SOME

02:04:38.304 --> 02:04:39.471
COMMENTS THAT WE SHARED WITH

02:04:39.538 --> 02:04:41.473
THE LEGISLATURE LATE INTO THE

02:04:41.540 --> 02:04:43.375
OPTIONAL EXPAND OUT EXCUSE ME

02:04:43.442 --> 02:04:44.276
THE OPTIONAL BENEFIT

02:04:44.343 --> 02:04:47.847
ELIMINATIONS AS WELL AS SOME OF

02:04:47.913 --> 02:04:50.583
THE REDUCTIONS IN ELIGIBILITY.

02:04:50.649 --> 02:04:52.117
THE FEDERAL LEGISLATION THAT

02:04:52.184 --> 02:04:53.886
PROVIDED AN ENHANCED FEDERAL

02:04:53.953 --> 02:04:56.155
SHARE OF COST FOR THE PROGRAM

02:04:56.222 --> 02:04:57.556
UP TO A CERTAIN CONDITIONS ON

02:04:57.623 --> 02:05:00.059
STAGE BUT THEY MAINTAIN

02:05:00.125 --> 02:05:02.394
ELIGIBILITY LEVELS. IN READING

02:05:02.461 --> 02:05:03.963
SOME GUIDANCE FROM THE FEDERAL

02:05:04.029 --> 02:05:07.099
GOVERNMENT WE FIND IT UNCLEAR

02:05:07.166 --> 02:05:09.301
WHETHER OR NOT FEDERAL RULE

02:05:09.368 --> 02:05:10.903
THAT BANNED THOSE FEDERAL

02:05:10.970 --> 02:05:11.804
CONDITIONS ON THE ENHANCED

02:05:11.871 --> 02:05:14.073
FEDERAL FUNDING COULD ACTUALLY

02:05:14.139 --> 02:05:15.040
YOU SORT OF AFFECTIVELY

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:16.609
PROHIBITED THE STATE FROM

02:05:16.675 --> 02:05:18.944
MAKING BENEFIT. AND ELIGIBILITY

02:05:19.011 --> 02:05:21.247
REDUCTIONS WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING

02:05:21.313 --> 02:05:23.182
THE ENHANCED FEDERAL FUNDING

02:05:23.249 --> 02:05:24.049
NOW THE ENHANCED FEDERAL

02:05:24.116 --> 02:05:25.751
FUNDING BRINGS IN MUCH MORE

02:05:25.818 --> 02:05:27.553
FEDERAL FUNDING THAN THE

02:05:27.620 --> 02:05:29.989
REDUCTIONS TO THE OPTIONAL

02:05:30.055 --> 02:05:31.757
BENEFITS SUCH AS THE SEA BASS

02:05:31.824 --> 02:05:34.193
PROGRAM ADULT DENTAL SERVICES

02:05:34.260 --> 02:05:36.662
AND I AND I AND OTHERS WOULD

02:05:36.729 --> 02:05:40.466
THAT. WOULD RELIEVE THE GENERAL

02:05:40.532 --> 02:05:41.667
FUND. AND SO WE DO HAVE

02:05:41.734 --> 02:05:42.968
OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

02:05:43.035 --> 02:05:44.904
ULTIMATELY WITH THE DEPARTMENT

02:05:44.970 --> 02:05:46.705
ON WHETHER OR NOT FEDERAL

02:05:46.772 --> 02:05:50.209
RULES- WOULD PROHIBIT US

02:05:50.276 --> 02:05:52.344
AFFECTIVELY FROM GETTING RID OF

02:05:52.411 --> 02:05:54.280
THOSE- GETTING RID OF THOSE

02:05:54.346 --> 02:05:56.515
ELIMINATIONS OR REDUCTIONS. AND

02:05:56.582 --> 02:05:59.485
THEN- AND THEN HOW THE STATE

02:05:59.551 --> 02:06:01.754
WILL ORT OF RE BALANCE THE

02:06:01.820 --> 02:06:04.423
OVERALL BUDGET IF IN FACT THOSE

02:06:04.490 --> 02:06:06.992
REDUCTIONS ARE NOT.

02:06:07.059 --> 02:06:09.762
FUNCTIONALLY ALLOWABLE. NEXTEL

02:06:09.828 --> 02:06:12.831
TURN QUICKLY TO THE- THE I. T.

02:06:12.898 --> 02:06:14.366
SYSTEM CHANGES THAT ARE

02:06:14.433 --> 02:06:19.438
PROPOSED IN IT IN MEDIC HAL- WE

02:06:19.505 --> 02:06:21.674
WE'VE- ANALYZE THIS-

02:06:21.740 --> 02:06:23.042
PRELIMINARILY AND FIND THAT THE

02:06:23.108 --> 02:06:24.944
LEGISLATURE HAS ONLY RECEIVED

02:06:25.010 --> 02:06:27.546
SO FAR PRELIMINARY COST

02:06:27.613 --> 02:06:29.315
SCHEDULE AND SCOPE IN

02:06:29.381 --> 02:06:31.183
INFORMATION FOR THE NEW

02:06:31.250 --> 02:06:33.886
MODERNIZATION EFFORTS. AND SO

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:35.287
WE THEREFORE RECOMMEND THAT THE

02:06:35.354 --> 02:06:37.222
LEGISLATURE ADOPT. A

02:06:37.289 --> 02:06:38.824
SUPPLEMENTAL REPORTING LANGUAGE

02:06:38.891 --> 02:06:39.925
THAT WOULD DIRECT THE

02:06:39.992 --> 02:06:42.628
ADMINISTRATION TO REPORT BACK

02:06:42.695 --> 02:06:44.496
TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TIMELY

02:06:44.563 --> 02:06:46.565
MANNER ON TOTAL COST AND

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:50.135
SCHEDULE AND SCOPE OF THE

02:06:50.202 --> 02:06:51.437
MODERNIZATION EFFORT. NEXT TURN

02:06:51.503 --> 02:06:53.172
QUICKLY TO SOME OF THE COVERT

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:56.241
RELATED- POLICY CHANGES SUCH AS

02:06:56.308 --> 02:06:59.478
AN EXPANSION OF COVERAGE-

02:06:59.545 --> 02:07:02.147
ELIGIBILITY FOR THE UNINSURED

02:07:02.214 --> 02:07:03.882
FOUR COVE IN TESTING AND

02:07:03.949 --> 02:07:05.551
TREATMENT AS WELL AS SOME OF

02:07:05.617 --> 02:07:08.120
THE OTHER- NEW FLEXIBILITIES

02:07:08.187 --> 02:07:09.888
HELLO AT THE END MINISTRATION

02:07:09.955 --> 02:07:12.558
IS PURSUING- RELATED TO

02:07:12.624 --> 02:07:13.993
TREATMENT INCLUDING SUCH THINGS

02:07:14.059 --> 02:07:16.495
AS TELEHEALTH OR- A LONG TERM

02:07:16.562 --> 02:07:19.898
CARE TEMPORARY RATE INCREASE-

02:07:19.965 --> 02:07:22.001
THE- THE LET THE ADMINISTRATION

02:07:22.067 --> 02:07:23.302
HAS PROPOSED TRAINABLE

02:07:23.369 --> 02:07:26.872
LANGUAGE- THAT WOULD. AUTHORIZE

02:07:26.939 --> 02:07:28.707
SOME OF THE FLEXIBILITIES FOR

02:07:28.774 --> 02:07:30.809
THE ADMINISTRATION TO PURSUE

02:07:30.876 --> 02:07:32.378
SUCH POLICIES AS THEY COME

02:07:32.444 --> 02:07:35.547
FORWARD AND WHILE WE UNDERSTAND

02:07:35.614 --> 02:07:36.982
THAT SUCH FLEXIBILITIES MAYBE

02:07:37.049 --> 02:07:38.350
REALLY IMPORTANT IN THE CASE OF

02:07:38.417 --> 02:07:41.353
SAY A SECOND WAVE OF HOPE IN

02:07:41.420 --> 02:07:42.287
NINETEEN OVER THE NEXT FISCAL

02:07:42.354 --> 02:07:45.057
YEAR- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS

02:07:45.124 --> 02:07:46.859
THAT THE- THAT THAT A TRAILER

02:07:46.925 --> 02:07:48.360
BILL LANGUAGE DOES NOT PROVIDE

02:07:48.427 --> 02:07:49.128
SIGNIFICANT LEGEND

02:07:49.194 --> 02:07:51.096
OPPORTUNITIES FOR LEGISLATIVE

02:07:51.163 --> 02:07:53.332
OVERSIGHT. OF ANY NEW POLICIES

02:07:53.399 --> 02:07:56.135
AND SPENDING THAT IS ADOPTED BY

02:07:56.201 --> 02:07:57.669
THE ADMINISTRATION SO AT

02:07:57.736 --> 02:07:59.638
MINIMUM THE LEGISLATURE MIGHT

02:07:59.705 --> 02:08:01.707
WANT TO CONSIDER- SOME

02:08:01.774 --> 02:08:02.808
ADDITIONAL REPORTING

02:08:02.875 --> 02:08:04.043
REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO ANY

02:08:04.109 --> 02:08:05.711
CHANGE POLICY CHANGES AND

02:08:05.778 --> 02:08:07.813
FUNDING CHANGING CHANGES THAT

02:08:07.880 --> 02:08:09.882
THE ADMINISTRATION. CHOOSES TO

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:12.618
ADOPT- AND THEN LASTLY WE DO

02:08:12.684 --> 02:08:13.752
HAVE OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS

02:08:13.819 --> 02:08:16.088
ABOUT THE- STATE ONLY CLAIMING

02:08:16.155 --> 02:08:17.856
ISSUE THIS IS THE ONE POINT

02:08:17.923 --> 02:08:19.758
FOUR BILLION THAT THE STATE IS

02:08:19.825 --> 02:08:21.660
NEEDING TO REPAY TO THE STATE

02:08:21.727 --> 02:08:23.062
TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT OUR

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:24.963
QUESTIONS ARE LARGELY ABOUT.

02:08:25.030 --> 02:08:27.132
WHAT PORTION OF THAT IS ONGOING

02:08:27.199 --> 02:08:29.401
VERSES OUT ONE TIME AND REALLY

FIRST WE ARE THE ADMINISTRATION

DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE

02:09:17.916 --> 02:09:20.185

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:21.987
CURRENTLY- IS IN REFERENCE TO

REFLECT THE NEW- ENTERPRISE

02:09:26.492 --> 02:09:28.460
MODERNIZATION EFFORT. AND IT

02:09:28.527 --> 02:09:31.296
REQUIRES- THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:09:31.363 --> 02:09:32.698
PROVIDE QUARTERLY PROJECT

02:09:32.764 --> 02:09:34.700
STATUS I THINK THE GREEN

02:09:34.766 --> 02:09:35.767
CONTRACT INFORMATION ON

02:09:35.834 --> 02:09:41.340
PROJECT. ON. PURPOSE AND COSTS

02:09:41.406 --> 02:09:42.441
SO. WE THINK THAT THAT DRESSING

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:43.976
QUESTIONS ON THE PACKAGE AND

02:09:44.042 --> 02:09:47.746
GREET NEW EFFORT. AND REGARDING

02:09:47.813 --> 02:09:50.382
THE CASELOAD AND MACHINES THAT-

02:09:50.449 --> 02:09:52.151
ELLIE- BROUGHT IN A RECURRING

02:09:52.217 --> 02:09:56.355
CLICKBAIT WE USED THE REMEMBER

02:09:56.421 --> 02:09:58.257
PER MONTH COST AVAILABLE AT THE

02:09:58.323 --> 02:09:59.124
TIME THAT WE DEVELOPED OUR

02:09:59.191 --> 02:09:59.825
ESTIMATE THAT THE

02:09:59.892 --> 02:10:00.859
ADMINISTRATION'S WORKING ON

02:10:00.926 --> 02:10:02.561
UPDATING THE SYSTEM AND WE

02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:03.762
BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO

02:10:03.829 --> 02:10:05.364
A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OUR

02:10:05.430 --> 02:10:06.665
ESTIMATED IN THE EARLY HOURS OF

02:10:06.732 --> 02:10:08.100
APPROXIMATELY THREE HUNDRED AND

02:10:08.167 --> 02:10:10.269
FIFTY MILLION GENERAL FUND AND-

02:10:10.335 --> 02:10:11.904
DOWN FROM THE CURRENT SEVEN

02:10:11.970 --> 02:10:12.638
HUNDRED AND FIFTY NINE DOLLAR

02:10:12.704 --> 02:10:16.808
DIFFERENCE. AND MAINLY WE WANT

02:10:16.875 --> 02:10:18.410
TO JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT WE USED

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:20.145
DATA BASED ON THE LAST

02:10:20.212 --> 02:10:21.747
RECESSION AND THE IMPACTS ON

02:10:21.813 --> 02:10:23.749
THE POPULATION THAT WE REFLECT

02:10:23.815 --> 02:10:25.083
THAT WE THINK WOULD BE A ROLE

02:10:25.150 --> 02:10:29.621
IN. THAT IN MEDIC COW. IS JOHN

02:10:29.688 --> 02:10:31.590
AVAILABLE AND ALL. ON THE ACA.

02:10:31.657 --> 02:10:33.058
OPTIONAL EXPANSION POPULATION

02:10:33.125 --> 02:10:34.126
THERE IS NO DATA AVAILABLE ON

02:10:34.193 --> 02:10:36.728
THAT SINCE IT'S DIFFICULT AT

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:38.830
TWO ON MAKING ASSUMPTIONS IT'S-

02:10:38.897 --> 02:10:42.234
DIFFICULT TO. ESTIMATE D. THE

02:10:42.301 --> 02:10:44.036
TOTAL CASELOAD. IN EACH OF

02:10:44.102 --> 02:10:45.871
THESE POPULATIONS HOWEVER AS

02:10:45.938 --> 02:10:47.439
ELIA NOTED BECAUSE HESE ARE

02:10:47.506 --> 02:10:49.441
CHILDLESS. SINGLE ADULTS THEY

02:10:49.508 --> 02:10:51.210
ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE IMPACTED

02:10:51.276 --> 02:10:53.478
BY UNEMPLOYMENT. HOWEVER I WILL

02:10:53.545 --> 02:10:54.513
NO BECAUSE THEIR TALENTS OF

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.515
GOLD IF THEY DO RECEIVE THE

02:10:56.582 --> 02:10:58.083
MAXIMUM UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

02:10:58.150 --> 02:11:00.285
THEY WOULD BE ABOUT INCOME THE

02:11:00.352 --> 02:11:01.753
INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLDS

02:11:01.820 --> 02:11:03.488
FOR MEDI CAL. AND IF THE CHILD

02:11:03.555 --> 02:11:05.123
A SINGLE GOAL IS EARNING

02:11:05.190 --> 02:11:06.625
MINIMUM WAGE AND NOT WORKING

02:11:06.692 --> 02:11:08.760
FULL TIME THEY'RE ALSO LIKELY

02:11:08.827 --> 02:11:09.761
TO ALREADY BE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI

02:11:09.828 --> 02:11:12.564
CAL. SO WE BELIEVE THAT OUR-

02:11:12.631 --> 02:11:15.601
CASELOAD ESTIMATE IS REASONABLE

02:11:15.667 --> 02:11:18.904
AND ANY- AND ANY CHANGES ANY

02:11:18.971 --> 02:11:19.404
FURTHER CHANGES TO THE

02:11:19.471 --> 02:11:22.040
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE WOULD

02:11:22.107 --> 02:11:25.744
JUST. BE A PURELY RANDOM YES.

02:11:25.811 --> 02:11:29.414
OKAY THANK YOU. CORRECT

02:11:29.481 --> 02:11:29.915

WONDERING IF- WE CAN GET

02:11:40.292 --> 02:11:41.860
COMMENT ON THE RATIONALE FOR

02:11:41.927 --> 02:11:44.696
CUTTING. FUNDING FOR SOME OF

02:11:44.763 --> 02:11:46.665
THE SENIOR PROGRAMS WHEN WE

02:11:46.732 --> 02:11:49.101
HAVE KEPT FINDING- WE'VE LEFT

02:11:49.167 --> 02:11:51.203
UNTOUCHED FUNDING IN THE BUDGET

02:11:51.270 --> 02:11:53.071
RELATING TO THE MARKET TO LESS

02:11:53.138 --> 02:11:56.141
VULNERABLE POPULATION BE

02:11:56.208 --> 02:11:56.775
NINETEEN TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLD I

02:11:56.842 --> 02:11:59.177
THINK UNDOCUMENTED YOUTH-

02:11:59.244 --> 02:12:01.246
CONSIDERING. THE FORMER

02:12:01.313 --> 02:12:03.181
POPULATION IS AT MUCH MORE

02:12:03.248 --> 02:12:06.518
RISK- I'M JUST CURIOUS ABOUT

02:12:06.585 --> 02:12:10.188
THE RATIONALE FOR THAT. OKAY SO

02:12:10.255 --> 02:12:12.224
J. C. COOPER HERE I THINK YOU

02:12:12.291 --> 02:12:14.693
KNOW WHAT- AS WE MENTIONED ALL

02:12:14.760 --> 02:12:17.596
OF THE- PROPOSALS PUT FORWARD

02:12:17.663 --> 02:12:19.731
WERE VERY CHALLENGING AND I HAD

02:12:19.798 --> 02:12:21.433
TO PUT FORWARD AND ESPECIALLY

02:12:21.500 --> 02:12:22.834
AROUND OUR SENIOR POPULATIONS I

02:12:22.901 --> 02:12:24.169
THINK ONE OF THE GUIDING

02:12:24.236 --> 02:12:25.270
PRINCIPLES OF THE

02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:27.873
ADMINISTRATION WAS TO- HAVE

02:12:27.939 --> 02:12:29.675
CLEAR ACCESS AND ELIGIBILITY TO

02:12:29.741 --> 02:12:31.410
MEDICAL SERVICES AND NOT-

02:12:31.476 --> 02:12:33.745
REMOVING THAT THE ELIGIBILITY.

02:12:33.812 --> 02:12:35.847
AND TO THE QUESTION REGARDS THE

02:12:35.914 --> 02:12:37.849
YOUNGER INDIVIDUALS AND THEN.

02:12:37.916 --> 02:12:39.751
AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED BOTH

02:12:39.818 --> 02:12:41.586
THE BASS AN MSSP ARE CONSIDERED

02:12:41.653 --> 02:12:44.022
OPTIONAL BENEFITS AND I'MGIVEN

02:12:44.089 --> 02:12:46.725

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:53.298
SIZE OF THE DEFICIT AS WELL AS

02:12:53.365 --> 02:12:55.033
HAVE A BALANCED BUDGET. WE HAD

02:12:55.100 --> 02:12:57.169
TO PUT FORWARD A RECOMMEND SUMS

02:12:57.235 --> 02:12:58.603
I'M VERY DIFFICULT PRODUCTIONS

INCLUDING BOTH THE BASS AND

02:13:02.074 --> 02:13:02.607

02:13:04.209 --> 02:13:05.711
HIGHLIGHTED IN MY EARLIER

02:13:05.777 --> 02:13:07.979
REMARKS THAT. A LARGE NUMBER IF

02:13:08.046 --> 02:13:09.381
NOT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE

02:13:09.448 --> 02:13:10.716
INDIVIDUALS ARE IN MEDICAID

02:13:10.782 --> 02:13:12.217
MANAGED CARE MEDICARE MANAGED

02:13:12.284 --> 02:13:13.585

02:13:19.658 --> 02:13:20.926
THEY ARE PREVENTING BOTH

02:13:20.992 --> 02:13:22.894
SKILLED NURSING FACILITY AS

02:13:26.932 --> 02:13:28.033
CONSIDERATION THERE AGAIN

02:13:28.100 --> 02:13:29.668
THOUGH I STILL HAVE KIDS I HAVE

02:13:29.735 --> 02:13:31.370
GREAT CONCERN ABOUT THE FACT

02:13:31.436 --> 02:13:32.938
THAT WE HAVE CUT FUNDING TO THE

02:13:33.004 --> 02:13:34.806
VERY POPULATION. THAT HAS BEEN

02:13:34.873 --> 02:13:36.174
HARDEST HIT BY THIS PANDEMIC

02:13:36.241 --> 02:13:39.644
AND IF. PERHAPS THERE IS A

02:13:39.711 --> 02:13:42.848
SECOND WAVE- I JUST I'M NOT. I

02:13:42.914 --> 02:13:44.383
JUST DON'T UNDERSTAND THE

02:13:44.449 --> 02:13:45.984
RATIONALE BEHIND IT BUT NONE

02:13:46.051 --> 02:13:47.719
THE LESS I APPRECIATE YOUR

02:13:47.786 --> 02:13:49.521
COMMENT TO BE LIKE TO ADD ON TO

02:13:49.588 --> 02:13:50.989

02:13:52.657 --> 02:13:54.159
ADDITIONAL QUESTION UNLESS SHE

CARES TO RESPOND- TO MY

02:13:56.695 --> 02:13:59.164
CONCERNS SURE I THINK THAT'S-

02:13:59.231 --> 02:14:01.299
THE OTHER REASON WE ARE-

02:14:01.366 --> 02:14:02.467
ANNOUNCING THE LONG TERM CARE

02:14:02.534 --> 02:14:04.703
AT HOME NEW BENEFITS WHICH WILL

02:14:04.770 --> 02:14:06.872
WILL GREATLY. ALLOW US TO BE

02:14:06.938 --> 02:14:08.507
ABLE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

02:14:08.573 --> 02:14:10.709
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE AT RISK

02:14:10.776 --> 02:14:11.810
ESPECIALLY OUR SENIOR

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:13.145
POPULATION AT RISK IN THEIR

02:14:13.211 --> 02:14:15.180
HOME- WHICH AT THIS TIME IS A

02:14:15.247 --> 02:14:16.615
BETTER PLACE FOR US TO BE

02:14:16.681 --> 02:14:18.817
PROVIDING CARE- AS A LARGE

02:14:18.884 --> 02:14:19.918
NUMBER OF I'M SENIOR

GOING IN. UNTIL VERY YES-

02:14:23.522 --> 02:14:24.656
PROGRAM CENTERS AND SO THE

02:14:24.723 --> 02:14:25.757
DEPARTMENT LOOKS FORWARD TO

02:14:25.824 --> 02:14:26.491
WORKING WITH BOTH THE

02:14:26.558 --> 02:14:27.826
LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS

02:14:27.893 --> 02:14:29.461

02:14:44.609 --> 02:14:45.944
CONFIDENCE AS I WOULD LIKE TO

HAVE A REGARDING THAT PROGRAM.

02:14:49.815 --> 02:14:51.349
BUT I GUESS THE OTHER QUESTION

02:14:51.416 --> 02:14:54.085
IS THERE A CONCERN- ON THE

02:14:58.056 --> 02:15:01.026
THE SWEEPING OF THE- PROP SIX

02:15:01.092 --> 02:15:05.263
FIFTY SIX FUNDING. SO YOU KNOW

02:15:05.330 --> 02:15:06.631

02:16:02.921 --> 02:16:06.625
HAVE FARM WORKERS THAT. DO YOU

02:16:06.691 --> 02:16:08.193
KNOW THERE ARE BUT THE AGE OF

02:16:08.260 --> 02:16:08.860
FIFTY FIVE THEY'RE THE SOLE

02:16:08.927 --> 02:16:10.228
PROVIDERS FOR THEIR FAMILIES

02:16:10.295 --> 02:16:10.996
THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE STILL

02:16:11.062 --> 02:16:15.500
RELYING ON- TO YOU KNOW FOR

02:16:15.567 --> 02:16:17.702
HOUSE SCENE AND FOOD AND- I.

02:16:17.769 --> 02:16:19.571
YOU KNOW I KNOW I KNOW THAT THE

02:16:19.638 --> 02:16:21.406
YOU KNOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND

02:16:21.473 --> 02:16:23.742
YOURSELF- HAVE FOUND. YOU KNOW

02:16:23.808 --> 02:16:28.313
CREATIVE WAYS. TO MAKE THINGS

02:16:28.380 --> 02:16:30.248
HAPPEN AND I'M HOPING THAT. YOU

02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:31.283
REALLY THINK ABOUT YOU KNOW

02:16:31.349 --> 02:16:36.655
THAT THE. AND BEYOND THAT THAT

02:16:36.721 --> 02:16:38.223
NEED HEALTH CARE NOW MORE THAN

02:16:38.290 --> 02:16:40.525
EVER ESPECIALLY IF THERE IS. A

02:16:40.592 --> 02:16:42.761
YOU KNOW AND- IN THE FALL WERE

02:16:42.827 --> 02:16:45.130
EXPECTING A COVETED TO RAMP UP

02:16:45.196 --> 02:16:46.698
AGAIN. I REALLY WANT YOU TO

02:16:46.765 --> 02:16:47.666
CONSIDER THAT THAT THE

02:16:47.732 --> 02:16:49.067
CONSEQUENCES OF NOT PROVIDING

02:16:49.134 --> 02:16:53.171
HEALTH CARE. BEYOND YOU KNOW

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:55.473
WHAT WE HAVE AT THE MOMENT. SO

02:16:55.540 --> 02:16:57.676
I THINK THAT THIS IS. AT A TIME

02:16:57.742 --> 02:16:58.176
WHERE WE CAN REALLY GET

02:16:58.243 --> 02:17:00.312
CREATIVE AND REALLY- PROVIDE

02:17:00.378 --> 02:17:03.181
HEALTH CARE FOR OUR- OUR OUR

02:17:03.248 --> 02:17:06.484
SENIORS THE OTHER THING I

02:17:06.551 --> 02:17:08.119
WANTED TO COMMENT ON IS THE-

02:17:08.186 --> 02:17:09.955
THE CLINIC FUNDING AND- I KNOW

02:17:10.021 --> 02:17:11.189
WE TALKED ABOUT THE- THE

02:17:11.256 --> 02:17:13.058
PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE AND- I'M

02:17:13.124 --> 02:17:14.225
ALREADY BEGINNING TO SEE. OR

02:17:14.292 --> 02:17:15.460
HEAR FROM FROM PEOPLE IN THE

02:17:15.527 --> 02:17:17.596
DISCIPLINE MY DISTRICT- TALK

02:17:17.662 --> 02:17:21.666
ABOUT- LAYOFFS AND- REDUCTION

02:17:21.733 --> 02:17:23.468
IN HOURS AND WHEN YOU HAVE ONE.

02:17:23.535 --> 02:17:26.571
CLINIC AND IN AN AREA FOR AN

02:17:26.638 --> 02:17:29.708
ENTIRE COMMUNITY. THAT THAT'S-

02:17:29.774 --> 02:17:32.978
BAD A MAJOR IMPACT. AND I KNOW

02:17:33.044 --> 02:17:35.580
THAT THERE'S- A CONVERSATIONS

02:17:35.647 --> 02:17:37.315
ABOUT TELL HELPFUL IN RURAL

02:17:37.382 --> 02:17:39.451
CALIFORNIA. THAT'S IT THAT

02:17:39.517 --> 02:17:41.453
DOESN'T ALWAYS NECESSARILY WORK

02:17:41.519 --> 02:17:42.087
SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT THAT

02:17:42.153 --> 02:17:45.056
OUT- THE OTHER THING IS THAT IT

02:17:45.123 --> 02:17:47.759
COMMUNITY BASED ADULT SERVICES

02:17:47.826 --> 02:17:49.227
I THINK. THIS IS SOMETHING ELSE

02:17:49.294 --> 02:17:50.595
THAT I'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT IT

02:17:50.662 --> 02:17:52.564
AT AT LEAST IN MY SENATE

02:17:52.631 --> 02:17:53.098
DISTRICT AND I CAN IMAGINE

02:17:53.164 --> 02:17:56.301
BEYOND. THE ENTIRE STATE. I

02:17:56.368 --> 02:17:57.302
THINK NOW MORE THAN EVER WE

02:17:57.369 --> 02:17:58.770
NEED THIS TONIGHT I UNDERSTAND

02:17:58.837 --> 02:18:00.171
THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU MADE IT

02:18:00.238 --> 02:18:01.906
IN TERMS OF CORPORATE AND- IT

02:18:01.973 --> 02:18:03.808
WHETHER OR NOT TO- FOLKS ARE

02:18:03.875 --> 02:18:05.944
YOU KNOW. GOING INTO THOSE

02:18:06.011 --> 02:18:08.680
PLACES BUT- THE REALITY IS

02:18:08.747 --> 02:18:11.483
THAT- I THINK THAT THAT OUR OUR

02:18:11.549 --> 02:18:12.917
AGENT COMMUNITY DESERVES TO

02:18:12.984 --> 02:18:19.290
LIVE IN DIGNITY. AND THIS THIS

02:18:19.357 --> 02:18:21.960
THEY WANT AND- I THINK THAT IS

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:23.928
SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO

02:18:23.995 --> 02:18:25.530
CONTINUE ADVOCATING FOR. AND

02:18:25.597 --> 02:18:28.166
THEN LASTLY OFONE OF THE OTHER

02:18:28.233 --> 02:18:28.900
THINGS THAT I WANTED TO POINT

02:18:28.967 --> 02:18:32.037
OUT IS. AS AS A CO AUTHOR OF

02:18:32.103 --> 02:18:34.072
THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION. TO

02:18:34.139 --> 02:18:35.240
ELIMINATE THE SENIOR PENDLETON

02:18:35.306 --> 02:18:37.142
THE MEDICAL PROGRAM I. AM

02:18:37.208 --> 02:18:39.244
DEEPLY CONCERNED ABOUT OUR LOW

02:18:39.310 --> 02:18:41.379
INCOME SENIORS AND- JUST

02:18:41.446 --> 02:18:43.214
OVERALL OUR SENIORS AND HERE IN

02:18:43.281 --> 02:18:44.749
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND I

02:18:44.816 --> 02:18:45.717
THINK THAT WE NEED TO DO

02:18:45.784 --> 02:18:47.252
EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT

02:18:47.318 --> 02:18:49.287
THEM. I UNDERSTAND THAT.

02:18:49.354 --> 02:18:51.489
THERE'S YOU KNOW TAKES MONEY

02:18:51.556 --> 02:18:54.759
AND THERE IS. A DEFICIT AND BUT

02:18:54.826 --> 02:18:56.995
I THINK THAT S. NOW IS AN

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:57.962
OPPORTUNITY TO REALLY GET

02:18:58.029 --> 02:18:59.564
CREATED TO REALLY CONTINUE TO

02:18:59.631 --> 02:19:01.766
FIND AND EXPAND THE PROGRAMS

02:19:01.833 --> 02:19:05.670
THAT WE HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU

02:19:05.737 --> 02:19:10.442
SIR HELLO. RIGHT FROM. SO I'VE

02:19:10.508 --> 02:19:12.377
SAID SEVERAL QUESTIONS AND SOME

02:19:12.444 --> 02:19:14.112
COMMENTS AS WELL AND AGAIN

02:19:14.179 --> 02:19:16.114
APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION TO

02:19:16.181 --> 02:19:18.650
THE PARK HEALTH CARE SERVICES-

02:19:18.717 --> 02:19:20.218
I APPRECIATE THAT- YOU ARE

02:19:20.285 --> 02:19:22.454
TRYING TO PRIORITIZE ENSURING

02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:25.557
THAT AS MANY PEOPLE AS WE CAN-

02:19:25.623 --> 02:19:26.791
TO CURRENTLY HAVE COVERAGE-

02:19:26.858 --> 02:19:29.928
CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN THAT I DO

02:19:29.994 --> 02:19:34.966
I DO. YOU KNOW. YEAH WELL IT'S

02:19:35.033 --> 02:19:38.036
THAT'S A BIG CONCERN THAT- YOU

02:19:38.103 --> 02:19:39.804
KNOW THAT- PROPOSAL THAT WAS TO

02:19:39.871 --> 02:19:41.072
EXPAND COVERAGE UNFORTUNATELY

02:19:41.139 --> 02:19:43.541
BECAUSE OF- BUDGETARY SITUATION

02:19:43.608 --> 02:19:46.311
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ON BEFORE

02:19:46.377 --> 02:19:48.113
IN TERMS OF SENIORS. WHO ARE

02:19:48.179 --> 02:19:50.548
UNDOCUMENTED BUT I GUESS AND I

02:19:50.615 --> 02:19:51.950
AND I KNOW THAT YOU LOOK AT

02:19:52.016 --> 02:19:53.651
THESE ISSUES CAREFULLY BUT NOW

02:19:53.718 --> 02:19:56.688
I AM STRUCK THAT- WE DO HAVE

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:59.624
SEVERAL ITEMS HERE THAT IN MY

02:19:59.691 --> 02:20:02.861
MIND- BUT WE SAVE WHAT WE HAVE

02:20:02.927 --> 02:20:04.028
TO DO COMPARES WHAT'S THE COST

02:20:04.095 --> 02:20:06.564
OF THE ALTERNATIVE. SO THE M.

02:20:06.631 --> 02:20:10.168
S. S. P. PROGRAM AND SEA BASS

02:20:10.235 --> 02:20:11.436
YOU KNOW AND THIS IS P. PROGRAM

02:20:11.503 --> 02:20:12.971
AND WE HEARD A BIT OF A

02:20:13.037 --> 02:20:15.874
PRESENTATION EARLIER THIS YEAR-

02:20:15.940 --> 02:20:17.075
THESE ARE SENIORS THAT

02:20:17.142 --> 02:20:19.177
ACTUALLY- ARE ELIGIBLE AND

02:20:19.244 --> 02:20:20.912
WOULD OTHERWISE GO TO A NURSING

02:20:20.979 --> 02:20:22.580
HOME WHICH BY THE WAY MEDIC

02:20:22.647 --> 02:20:24.048
HOUSE ALSO PAYS FOR. IT'S MUCH

02:20:24.115 --> 02:20:27.085
MORE EXPENSIVE- AND SO WE'RE

02:20:27.152 --> 02:20:28.486
CALLING ON ELIMINATING THAT

02:20:28.553 --> 02:20:31.489
PROGRAM AND WELL I THINK-

02:20:31.556 --> 02:20:32.557
APPRECIATE A NEW FOUND

02:20:32.624 --> 02:20:33.625
CONFIDENCE WE HAVE IN OUR

02:20:33.691 --> 02:20:35.059
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE PROGRAMS

02:20:35.126 --> 02:20:36.261
TO TAKE CARE OF THEM THAT

02:20:36.327 --> 02:20:38.196
WASN'T THERE- EARLIER IN THE

02:20:38.263 --> 02:20:40.098
YEAR WHEN WE WERE TALKING ABOUT

02:20:40.165 --> 02:20:42.567
THIS PROGRAM SO- I AM LITTLE-

02:20:42.634 --> 02:20:45.170
I'M- SKEPTICAL ABOUT THE IDEA

02:20:45.236 --> 02:20:49.007
THAT THE- MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE

02:20:49.073 --> 02:20:49.574
PROGRAMS WILL BE ALSO IN THE

02:20:49.641 --> 02:20:50.275
GAPS AND THAT. MANY OF THESE

02:20:50.341 --> 02:20:51.376
PATIENTS WON'T END UP IN A

02:20:51.442 --> 02:20:52.710
NURSING HOME WHICH IT ACTUALLY

02:20:52.777 --> 02:20:56.281
COST US MUCH MORE- YEAH- THE

02:20:56.347 --> 02:20:57.549
SAME WITH CBS PROGRAM IS

02:20:57.615 --> 02:20:59.184
SOMETHING THAT ALSO HELPS KEEP

02:20:59.250 --> 02:21:01.186
PEOPLE OUT- WE'LL TALK ABOUT

02:21:01.252 --> 02:21:03.521
IHS US LATER SO WE WON'T TOUCH

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:04.422
YOU KNOW WE'LL GET INTO THAT

02:21:04.489 --> 02:21:05.824
BUT THAT'S KIND OF SIMILAR

02:21:05.890 --> 02:21:10.395
QUESTION THERE- EVEN THREE

02:21:10.461 --> 02:21:12.597
SAMPLE. SUBSAMPLE WE ALSO HAVE

02:21:12.664 --> 02:21:14.465
NOT REALLY TO SENIORS BUT IN

02:21:14.532 --> 02:21:16.668
THE E. OURS- THE- BEHAVIORAL

02:21:16.734 --> 02:21:17.735
HEALTH COUNSELORS IN THE E.

02:21:17.802 --> 02:21:19.270
OURS AND TO HELP WITH THEIR

02:21:19.337 --> 02:21:21.706
OPIOID CRISIS- AND I THINK WHEN

02:21:21.773 --> 02:21:23.808
WE HEARD THAT. PRESENTATION FR

02:21:23.875 --> 02:21:25.844
THAT INITIALLY. I THINK WE

02:21:25.910 --> 02:21:26.744
HEARD ABOUT HOW OLD THE

02:21:26.811 --> 02:21:29.147
RESEARCHERS PEOPLE HAD PILOTED

02:21:29.214 --> 02:21:29.781
THIS PROGRAM ACTUALLY SAW COST

02:21:29.848 --> 02:21:32.483
SAVINGS. SO I AM CONCERNED THAT

02:21:32.550 --> 02:21:34.385
WE'RE MAKING CUTS- AND

02:21:34.452 --> 02:21:35.386
CERTAINLY IT'S NOT THE MAJORITY

02:21:35.453 --> 02:21:36.487
CUT IS ACTUALLY PROBABLY A

02:21:36.554 --> 02:21:37.856
SMALL FRACTION OF THE CUTS BUT

02:21:37.922 --> 02:21:39.324
THESE ARE CUTS THAT ACTUALLY

02:21:39.390 --> 02:21:41.860
LEAD TO GREATER EXPENSES. TO

02:21:41.926 --> 02:21:43.761
OUR STATE MOVING FORWARD-

02:21:43.828 --> 02:21:44.896
BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENED IS WE'LL

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:45.530
HAVE PATIENTS SHIFTED

02:21:45.597 --> 02:21:46.865
ESSENTIALLY FROM ONE PROGRAM OR

02:21:46.931 --> 02:21:47.999
FUNDING THAT WERE ELIMINATING

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:49.701
OR CUTTING TO ANOTHER PROGRAM

02:21:49.767 --> 02:21:54.539
THAT. WE HAVE THAT WE'RE PAYING

02:21:54.606 --> 02:21:57.876
FOR AS WELL. SO IT I GUESS MY

02:21:57.942 --> 02:22:01.145
IS THAT- HOW DID THE DEPARTMENT

02:22:01.212 --> 02:22:03.715
EVALUATES A V. CUT THESE ARE

02:22:03.781 --> 02:22:05.984
THE OFFSET TO THE CUTS IN TERMS

02:22:06.050 --> 02:22:08.152
OF WHERE THESE PATIENTS MAY END

02:22:08.219 --> 02:22:09.287
UP I MEAN IT DID YOU RESUME

02:22:09.354 --> 02:22:10.755
THAT EVERYONE ON M. S. S. P.

02:22:10.822 --> 02:22:12.156
WOULD NOT END UP IN A NURSING

02:22:12.223 --> 02:22:14.492
HOME BECAUSE MANAGED MANAGED

02:22:14.559 --> 02:22:15.059
CARE WOULD PICK UP OR WHAT

02:22:15.126 --> 02:22:17.562
PERCENTAGE OF- THE SENIORS WHO

02:22:17.629 --> 02:22:19.063
ARE ON M. S. P. BY ELIMINATING

02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:20.598
IT WOULD END UP IN A NURSING

02:22:20.665 --> 02:22:21.766
HOME THAT WAS OUR PROJECTION

02:22:21.833 --> 02:22:23.902
MADE OF THAT IT DIDN'T MAKE A

02:22:23.968 --> 02:22:25.203
DECISION TO MAKE A CUT TO THAT

02:22:25.270 --> 02:22:26.404
ARE CENTRAL TO LIMIT THE

02:22:26.471 --> 02:22:31.876
PROGRAM FRANKLY. AND A PROPOSAL.

02:22:31.943 --> 02:22:34.312
HI SENATOR PAN SO- WE DID NOT

02:22:34.379 --> 02:22:36.614
SCORE ON ANY ADDITIONAL COSTS

02:22:36.681 --> 02:22:38.750
TIED TO- INCREASE SKILLED

02:22:38.816 --> 02:22:40.118
NURSING FACILITY WITHIN THE

02:22:40.184 --> 02:22:42.353
BUDGET JUST TO BE CLEAR- I

02:22:42.420 --> 02:22:45.156
THINK. THE COMBINATION OF BOTH-

02:22:45.223 --> 02:22:46.691
THE MANAGED CARE PLAN WHICH THE

02:22:46.758 --> 02:22:47.959
MAJORITY OF THESE INDIVIDUALS

02:22:48.026 --> 02:22:49.761
AS WELL. AS WELL AS THE OTHER.

02:22:49.827 --> 02:22:51.596
I'M IN COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES

02:22:51.663 --> 02:22:53.197
THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE. IN THE

02:22:53.264 --> 02:22:54.565
PROGRAM THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE

02:22:54.632 --> 02:22:56.534
TO DO TRANSITION PLANNING- OF

02:22:56.601 --> 02:22:58.770
THOSE INDIVIDUALS WITH. AND WE

02:22:58.836 --> 02:23:00.571
DID NOT SCORE ADDITIONAL COSTS

02:23:00.638 --> 02:23:03.007
AND THEN WOULD NOTE- WE THE

02:23:03.074 --> 02:23:03.875
ADDITIONAL WORK AT THE

02:23:03.942 --> 02:23:05.276
DEPARTMENT HAD BEEN WORKING ON.

02:23:05.343 --> 02:23:06.711
WHICH WE UNDERSTAND WAS NOT A

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:08.780
PART OF THE MAY RELY A REVISED

02:23:08.846 --> 02:23:09.681
RELEASE THAT HAS BEEN

02:23:09.747 --> 02:23:11.482
SUBSEQUENTLY- AND NOW THROUGH

02:23:11.549 --> 02:23:13.451
THE LONG TERM CARE AT HOME. I'M

02:23:13.518 --> 02:23:15.820
EXPLORING THAT OPTION- FIRST

02:23:15.887 --> 02:23:18.156
STATEWIDE AND JUST MAKE SURE

02:23:18.222 --> 02:23:19.691
THAT PEOPLEUNDERSTAND THAT

02:23:19.757 --> 02:23:20.692
PROPOSAL WOULD BE A B. BEYOND

02:23:20.758 --> 02:23:21.726
THE PUBLIC HEALTH EMERGENCY

02:23:21.793 --> 02:23:24.028
WOULD BE AN ONGOING. BENEFIT

02:23:24.095 --> 02:23:25.463
THE COMBINATION OF THOSE THINGS

02:23:25.530 --> 02:23:27.198
THIS. IS WHY WE DID NOT SCORE

02:23:27.265 --> 02:23:29.100
THAT- BUT I UNDERSTAND YOUR

02:23:29.167 --> 02:23:30.568
POINT IN REGARDS TO THE

02:23:30.635 --> 02:23:31.302
VULNERABILITY OF THOSE

02:23:31.369 --> 02:23:33.271
INDIVIDUALS. AND IN IN THE

02:23:33.338 --> 02:23:35.940
PROGRAM- AND- THE DIGIT DUE

02:23:36.007 --> 02:23:36.874
DILIGENCE THAT WOULD BE

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:37.909
REQUIRED DURING THOSE

02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:39.377
TRANSITIONS TO ENSURE THAT

02:23:39.444 --> 02:23:42.180
PEOPLE DO NOT. END UP- YOU KNOW

02:23:42.246 --> 02:23:43.781
INAPPROPRIATELY IN INNISFIL

02:23:43.848 --> 02:23:44.649
NURSING FACILITY WHEN IT COULD

02:23:44.716 --> 02:23:47.418
HAVE BEEN AVOIDED. OKAY SO-

02:23:47.485 --> 02:23:48.853
APPRECIATE WHAT YOU SAID I

02:23:48.920 --> 02:23:50.388
THINK THAT I GUESS WHAT I WOULD

02:23:50.455 --> 02:23:52.590
SAY ASK IS THAT. WE NOT

02:23:52.657 --> 02:23:54.525
ELIMINATE THIS PROGRAM BEFORE

02:23:54.592 --> 02:23:56.794
WE SET UP THE OTHER PROGRAM SO

02:23:56.861 --> 02:23:58.663
I. HEAR WHAT YOU SAID ABOUT THE

02:23:58.730 --> 02:24:00.298
LONG TERM CARE AT HOME BENEFITS

02:24:00.365 --> 02:24:02.133
IT'S APPRECIATE ANNOUNCING IT

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:05.670
LAST FRIDAY. I DO HOPE THAT-

02:24:05.737 --> 02:24:07.472
THAT ENDED YOU MENTIONED IF I

02:24:07.538 --> 02:24:08.906
WOULD ACTUALLY BE IMPLEMENTED

02:24:08.973 --> 02:24:10.508
THAT EVEN ON A REALLY FAST

02:24:10.575 --> 02:24:12.777
TRACK UNTIL. THE THIS FISCAL

02:24:12.844 --> 02:24:14.112
YEAR BUT IT WOULD BE YOU KNOW

02:24:14.178 --> 02:24:15.046
ESSENTIALLY IN THE SPRING OR

02:24:15.113 --> 02:24:16.414
MAYBE WE'RE REALLY LUCKY A

02:24:16.481 --> 02:24:19.484
LITTLE EARLIER IN THE SPRING-

02:24:19.550 --> 02:24:21.753
SO BUT I THINK THAT- THAT MEANS

02:24:21.819 --> 02:24:22.286
THAT WE SHOULD. HAVE THE

02:24:22.353 --> 02:24:23.755
OPPORTUNITY TO VET THIS MORE

02:24:23.821 --> 02:24:25.790
THOROUGHLY AS A SUBCOMMITTEE-

02:24:25.857 --> 02:24:27.725
SO PERHAPS NOT PUT THIS INTO

02:24:27.792 --> 02:24:34.732
THE MAY REVISE BUT- IN TERMS OF

02:24:34.799 --> 02:24:35.366
EXPECTING THAT IT'S I. BE THERE

02:24:35.433 --> 02:24:36.134
BUT FOR YOU KNOW WAS BEFORE.

02:24:36.200 --> 02:24:37.068
LEAVE SESSION AUGUST THAT WE

02:24:37.135 --> 02:24:38.136
HAVEN'T OF IT SOME OF THIS.

02:24:38.202 --> 02:24:39.937
MEANTIME THOUGH SOUNDS LIKE WE

02:24:40.004 --> 02:24:40.471
STILL NEED THE M. S. S. P.

02:24:40.538 --> 02:24:41.906
PROGRAM THAT HAPPENS. SO EVEN

02:24:41.973 --> 02:24:42.974
IF WE ARE ABLE TO PUT THIS

02:24:43.041 --> 02:24:45.476
THING IN PLACE. IN JANUARY OR

02:24:45.543 --> 02:24:47.545
FEBRUARY OR WHATEVER HAPPENS

02:24:47.612 --> 02:24:49.180
WE'RE STILL GONNA NEED PROGRAMS

02:24:49.247 --> 02:24:52.016
LIKE M. S. S. P. AND C. BASS.

02:24:52.083 --> 02:24:54.218
AND I DO THINK THAT. I THINK IT

02:24:54.285 --> 02:24:55.186
WOULD BE A REMARKABLE

02:24:55.253 --> 02:24:57.121
ASSUMPTION TO BE ACHE THAT.

02:24:57.188 --> 02:24:58.356
NONE OF THE PEOPLE WE ACTUALLY

02:24:58.423 --> 02:25:00.591
ELIMINATE THE PROGRAM JULY

02:25:00.658 --> 02:25:01.225
FIRST IS BEING PROPOSED IN THE

02:25:01.292 --> 02:25:03.227
MAY REVISE. THAT NONE OF THOSE

02:25:03.294 --> 02:25:05.396
PATIENTS WHO ACTUALLY. RECENTLY

02:25:05.463 --> 02:25:07.198
MSP ALREADY QUALIFY FOR BEING

02:25:07.265 --> 02:25:08.533
ADMITTED FOR LONG TERM CARE

02:25:08.599 --> 02:25:09.667
SERVICES WILL NOT END UP IN A

02:25:09.734 --> 02:25:11.903
NURSING HOME- I MEAN I THINK-

02:25:11.969 --> 02:25:13.438
EVEN EVEN WITH MEDICARE MANAGED

02:25:13.504 --> 02:25:15.540
CARE I'M SURE THAT- TRYING TO

02:25:15.606 --> 02:25:17.642
SAVE SOME OF THEM- THAT. NONE

02:25:17.708 --> 02:25:18.876
OF THEM WOULD ACTUALLY END UP

02:25:18.943 --> 02:25:20.078
THERE AND CERTAINLY IT'S MUCH

02:25:20.144 --> 02:25:21.813
MORE EXPENSIVE THERE SO I THINK

02:25:21.879 --> 02:25:23.014
THE COST OFFSET MAY TURN OUT TO

02:25:23.081 --> 02:25:27.385
BE- AS EXPENSIVE AS THE- THE

02:25:27.452 --> 02:25:28.686
ELIMINATION OF THE PROGRAM SO I

02:25:28.753 --> 02:25:30.388
DID. SO LET'S LET'S FIGURE OUT

02:25:30.455 --> 02:25:31.556
HOW WE PLACE THESE THINGS IN A

02:25:31.622 --> 02:25:32.957
WAY TO ENSURE THAT PEOPLE DON'T

02:25:33.024 --> 02:25:36.027
FALL IN THE GAPS- I DO WANT TO

02:25:36.094 --> 02:25:40.098
TOUCH ON PROP FIFTY SIX. SO

02:25:40.164 --> 02:25:40.731
WHEN PROP FIFTY SIX PASSED IN.

02:25:40.798 --> 02:25:42.633
WRAPS ELLIE- CAN COMMENTS ON

02:25:42.700 --> 02:25:44.502
THIS AS WELL WE HAD THIS

02:25:44.569 --> 02:25:45.970
DISCUSSION BECAUSE THERE WAS

02:25:46.037 --> 02:25:47.438
ORIGINALLY A PROPOSAL SOMETHING

02:25:47.505 --> 02:25:49.273
TO JUST ROLL PROPERTY SIX INTO

02:25:49.340 --> 02:25:51.843
MEDICARE MANAGED CARE. AND I

02:25:51.909 --> 02:25:54.112
THINK THAT IS CONTRARY TO THE

02:25:54.178 --> 02:25:54.712
WILL OF THE VOTERS WHO PASSED

02:25:54.779 --> 02:25:56.280
PROPERTY SIX. I CERTAINLY

02:25:56.347 --> 02:25:58.116
RECOGNIZE WE HAVE A BUDGET

02:25:58.182 --> 02:25:59.550
ISSUE THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY

02:25:59.617 --> 02:26:00.585
WE WANT TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT

02:26:00.651 --> 02:26:01.919
HOW TO WORK IT BUT I THINK

02:26:01.986 --> 02:26:04.288
SIMPLY TO ROLL IT BACK INTO-

02:26:04.355 --> 02:26:06.457
MEDICO. I MADE THIS CLEAR

02:26:06.524 --> 02:26:08.993
WHAT'S BEING PROPOSED IS

02:26:09.060 --> 02:26:11.329
CONTRARY TO WHAT THE VOTERS.

02:26:11.395 --> 02:26:12.964
EXPECTED WHEN THEY VOTED FOR-

02:26:13.030 --> 02:26:16.267
THIS REVENUE SOURCE AND- AND

02:26:16.334 --> 02:26:18.536
THAT'S WHY WE EVENTUALLY IS-

02:26:18.603 --> 02:26:20.505
LEGISLATURE AND- PREVIOUS

02:26:20.571 --> 02:26:23.007
GOVERNOR AGREED THAT WE WOULD-

02:26:23.074 --> 02:26:26.410
BASICALLY. THE SHIRT REDIRECT

02:26:26.477 --> 02:26:28.012
TO ORGANIZE THE FUNDS IN A WAY

02:26:28.079 --> 02:26:30.047
THAT- ADDRESSED WHAT THE VOTERS

02:26:30.114 --> 02:26:34.218
WANTED AND SO- PERHAPS ELLIE

02:26:34.285 --> 02:26:36.220
OKAY IT WOULD YOU CAN YOU

02:26:36.287 --> 02:26:38.089
COMMENT IS- THE REMARKS I MADE

02:26:38.156 --> 02:26:39.056
AND I THINK SOME OF YOU WERE

02:26:39.123 --> 02:26:43.294
AROUND AT THE TIME- IS. THE

02:26:43.361 --> 02:26:45.363
ACCURACY OF WHAT I AM SAYING IN

02:26:45.429 --> 02:26:46.731
TERMS OF THE WAY PROPERTY

02:26:46.797 --> 02:26:49.567
SIXES. IT WAS IT WAS- WRITTEN

02:26:49.634 --> 02:26:51.102
AND PASSED BY THE VOTERS AND

02:26:51.169 --> 02:26:54.005
THE EXPECTATIONS OF THE VOTERS

02:26:54.071 --> 02:26:56.807
FOR PROPERTY SIX. BEN JOHNSON

02:26:56.874 --> 02:26:59.443
AGAIN WITH THE L. A. L. I THINK

02:26:59.510 --> 02:27:01.379
THAT DOES. YOU'RE RIGHT THAT

02:27:01.445 --> 02:27:03.414
THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX- THE

02:27:03.481 --> 02:27:06.017
PIECE FOR MEDIC HAL IS- WRITTEN

02:27:06.083 --> 02:27:07.718
SO THAT IT'S IN YOU KNOW THE

02:27:07.785 --> 02:27:09.587
FUNDING FOR MEDICARE AL IS

02:27:09.654 --> 02:27:12.356
INTENDED TO INCREASE PAYMENTS.

02:27:12.423 --> 02:27:13.858
IN THE FIRST YEAR THAT THE

02:27:13.925 --> 02:27:15.059
FUNDING WAS AVAILABLE THE

02:27:15.126 --> 02:27:17.595
ADMINISTRATION DID PROPOSE- TO

02:27:17.662 --> 02:27:20.631
USE THAT TO OFFSET- GROWTH IN

02:27:20.698 --> 02:27:22.600
THE PROGRAM GENERAL FUND GROWTH

02:27:22.667 --> 02:27:25.670
IN THE PROGRAM. AND ULTIMATELY

02:27:25.736 --> 02:27:28.239
A- AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED

02:27:28.306 --> 02:27:29.440
REALLY BETWEEN THE LEGISLATURE

02:27:29.507 --> 02:27:31.175
AND THE ADMINISTRATION WHICH

02:27:31.242 --> 02:27:33.778
WOULD. PROVIDE A PORTION OF THE

02:27:33.844 --> 02:27:35.179
FUNDING AND A SIGNIFICANT

02:27:35.246 --> 02:27:36.147
PORTION OF THE FUNDING FOR

02:27:36.214 --> 02:27:37.882
PROVIDER PAYMENT INCREASES.

02:27:37.949 --> 02:27:40.151
WHILE ALSO PROVIDING SOME OF

02:27:40.218 --> 02:27:41.652
THE FUNDING TO OFFSET GENERAL

02:27:41.719 --> 02:27:43.554
FUND SPENDING ON GROWTH IN THE

02:27:43.621 --> 02:27:45.790
PROGRAM. AT THAT ARRANGEMENT

02:27:45.856 --> 02:27:48.259
WAS MAINTAINED FOR I BELIEVE

02:27:48.326 --> 02:27:50.428
ONE MORE YEAR BEFORE ACTUALLY

02:27:50.494 --> 02:27:52.363
ALL OF THE FUNDING HAS BEEN

02:27:52.430 --> 02:27:52.897
USED FOR PROVIDER PAYMENT

02:27:52.964 --> 02:27:56.834
INCREASES. US SINCE THEN- SO

02:27:56.901 --> 02:27:58.069
THERE IS SOME LEGISLATIVE THERE

02:27:58.135 --> 02:28:00.004
IS THERE IS A HISTORY OF USING

02:28:00.071 --> 02:28:01.539
IT TO OFFSET GENERAL FUND

02:28:01.606 --> 02:28:03.641
COSTING GROWS. AND IT YOU KNOW

02:28:03.708 --> 02:28:05.476
WELL THERE IS A- THERE THERE

02:28:05.543 --> 02:28:06.544
CERTAINLY IS A NONSTOP

02:28:06.611 --> 02:28:08.746
PLANTATION CLOSET IN IN THIS

02:28:08.813 --> 02:28:12.116
PIECE OF PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX-

02:28:12.183 --> 02:28:14.218
IT'S UNCERTAIN WHETHER OR NOT.

02:28:14.285 --> 02:28:16.387
WE WOULD THE STATE WE MAY HAVE

02:28:16.454 --> 02:28:18.489
TO MAKE YOU KNOW OTHER. PAYMENT

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:22.493
REDUCTIONS ABSENT YOU KNOW. BUT

02:28:22.560 --> 02:28:23.661
I'M USING THIS FUNDING TO

02:28:23.728 --> 02:28:29.367
OFFSET. GROWTH IN THE PROGRAM

02:28:29.433 --> 02:28:30.601
SO. NOW SUPPLICATION CLAUSES.

02:28:30.668 --> 02:28:31.836
SEEM OUR OUR OUR DIFFERENT TO

02:28:31.902 --> 02:28:32.803
EMPLOY BECAUSE BECAUSE IT'S

02:28:32.870 --> 02:28:34.105
HARD TO ALWAYS ESTABLISH WHAT

02:28:34.171 --> 02:28:35.740
THE BASELINE IS BUT- YOU'RE

02:28:35.806 --> 02:28:37.074
RIGHT THAT SORT OF POINT OUT

02:28:37.141 --> 02:28:39.043
THIS THIS ASPECT OF THE SORT OF

02:28:39.110 --> 02:28:40.978
COMPLEX LEGISLATIVE HISTORY.

02:28:41.045 --> 02:28:42.480
OKAY I APPRECIATE THAT

02:28:42.546 --> 02:28:43.881
CERTAINLY WE WANT TO WORK

02:28:43.948 --> 02:28:45.082
DILIGENTLY TO WANT TO WORK WITH

02:28:45.149 --> 02:28:47.184
THE ADMINISTRATION ON THIS

02:28:47.251 --> 02:28:48.152
WOULD CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND AND

02:28:48.219 --> 02:28:50.154
I WAS AROUND TWENTY TEN- THAT

02:28:50.221 --> 02:28:51.889
WE HAVE THAT YEAH WE HAVE TO

02:28:51.956 --> 02:28:53.090
ADDRESS THE BUDGET DEFICIT BUT

02:28:53.157 --> 02:28:54.091
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT

02:28:54.158 --> 02:28:55.526
PROP FIFTY SIX INTEREST.

02:28:55.593 --> 02:28:57.595
STRUCTURE WELL WE CERTAINLY CAN

02:28:57.662 --> 02:28:59.697
CONTRIBUTE TO DRESSING SOME OF

02:28:59.764 --> 02:29:01.198
THE DEFICIT SHOULD BE PRESERVED

02:29:01.265 --> 02:29:03.401
AND IN MANY WAYS- BUT OBVIOUSLY

02:29:03.467 --> 02:29:05.436
ADJUSTMENTS NEED TO BE MADE TO

02:29:05.503 --> 02:29:06.604
FOR THE- CURRENT BUDGET%

02:29:06.671 --> 02:29:08.339
SITUATION- BUT I THINK SIMPLY

02:29:08.406 --> 02:29:09.707
JUST ROLLING INTO MEDICARE OUT

02:29:09.774 --> 02:29:11.475
OF THE WAY THAT'S PROPOSED IS

02:29:11.542 --> 02:29:12.543
CONTRARY TO THE WILL OF THE

02:29:12.610 --> 02:29:13.344
VOTERS AND I THINK IT'S VERY

02:29:13.411 --> 02:29:15.112
IMPORTANT THAT WE- RESPECT THE

02:29:15.179 --> 02:29:15.680
WILL OF THE VOTERS WHEN IT

02:29:15.746 --> 02:29:18.749
COMES INITIATIVES. AND NOW MORE

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:20.885
SPECIFICALLY SOME OF THE ISSUES

02:29:20.951 --> 02:29:22.353
WERE RAISED. REGARDING PROP

02:29:22.420 --> 02:29:24.789
FIFTY SIX- I UNDERSTAND THAT-

02:29:24.855 --> 02:29:27.291
SINCE LEADERS- ELIMINATION OF

02:29:27.358 --> 02:29:28.926
THIS FAMILY PLANNING FUNDING

02:29:28.993 --> 02:29:30.161
THAT WAS ORIGINALLY PART OF

02:29:30.227 --> 02:29:33.531
PROP FIFTY SIX- IF I RECALL

02:29:33.597 --> 02:29:35.466
CORRECTLY WE ACTUALLY GET A

02:29:35.533 --> 02:29:38.336
NINE TO ONE MATCH FOR THAT- SO.

02:29:38.402 --> 02:29:40.037
EVEN WITH THE INCREASED F. MAP

02:29:40.104 --> 02:29:42.473
IF WE ROLL IT INTO THE OVERALL

02:29:42.540 --> 02:29:45.176
MEDICAL PROGRAM THE MATCH I

02:29:45.242 --> 02:29:47.378
BELIEVE DROPS IS. PERHAPS TEACH

02:29:47.445 --> 02:29:49.880
YES COULD COMMENT ON WAS THAT

02:29:49.947 --> 02:29:51.215
STATEMENT INACCURATE THAT WE

02:29:51.282 --> 02:29:52.516
ACTUALLY LOSING MATCH BY

02:29:52.583 --> 02:29:56.187
SHIFTING THE FUNDS FROM. FAMILY

02:29:56.253 --> 02:29:57.355
PLANNING IN HOUSE ORIGINALLY

02:29:57.421 --> 02:29:59.757
USED IN PROPERTY SIX AND-

02:29:59.824 --> 02:30:01.692
PREVIOUS YEAR TO WHAT WE'RE

02:30:01.759 --> 02:30:03.361
PROPOSING NOW WE'RE GONNA BE

02:30:03.427 --> 02:30:05.196
ACTUALLY DECREASING AMOUNT OF

02:30:05.262 --> 02:30:06.731
FEDERAL MATCH WE'RE GETTING.

02:30:06.797 --> 02:30:10.201

MA'AM- AND- REALLY THE PROPOSAL

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:22.346
WAS TO ELIMINATE ALL

SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT- PIECES

02:30:24.915 --> 02:30:26.283
WITH THE FEW REMAINING PIECES

02:30:26.350 --> 02:30:28.519
THAT WERE- RESERVES THROUGH THE

02:30:28.586 --> 02:30:29.387
PROPERTY SIX WHICH BE

02:30:29.453 --> 02:30:35.126

FINANCE COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE

02:30:35.826 --> 02:30:44.001

COMMENTS WITH THE- J. C. AND

02:30:53.778 --> 02:30:54.912
WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT REGARDLESS

02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:56.414
OF THE FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE

02:30:56.480 --> 02:30:58.115
FAMILY PLANNING AND WOMEN'S

02:30:58.182 --> 02:30:58.883
HEALTH PROGRAMS THEY WOULD BE A

02:30:58.949 --> 02:31:01.051
NINE TO TEN MATCH. OKAY SO

02:31:01.118 --> 02:31:03.421
AGAIN TO ME UNLESS YOU'RE

02:31:03.487 --> 02:31:04.321
TELLING ME THAT YOU DON'T THINK

02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:05.656
FAMILY PLANNING'S IMPORTANCE

02:31:05.723 --> 02:31:06.824
AND I WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE

02:31:06.891 --> 02:31:08.826
WITH THAT STATEMENT I'M NOT

02:31:08.893 --> 02:31:09.627
SURE WHERE WE'RE REMOVING MONEY

02:31:09.693 --> 02:31:11.962
FROM THE SYSTEM- BY DOING THAT

02:31:12.029 --> 02:31:14.098
SO I HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE A

02:31:14.165 --> 02:31:14.832
CONVERSATION ABOUT RESTORING

02:31:14.899 --> 02:31:18.102
THAT FUNDING- SINCE WE GET A-

02:31:18.169 --> 02:31:19.470
THIS IS TO GET BETTER MATCH AND

02:31:19.537 --> 02:31:20.738
CERTAINLY I THINK. THAT LET'S

02:31:20.805 --> 02:31:21.539
SEE WHAT ELSE TO TELL ME THAT

02:31:21.605 --> 02:31:22.840
THE DEMAND FOR THOSE SERVICES

02:31:22.907 --> 02:31:24.475
IS NOT THERE BUT I THINK AGAIN

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:25.709
I WOULD STRONGLY DISAGREE AND I

02:31:25.776 --> 02:31:27.745
THINK MANY OTHERS WITH AS WELL

02:31:27.812 --> 02:31:28.579
SO I HOPE WE CAN HAVE THAT

02:31:28.646 --> 02:31:30.981
CONVERSATION- THE OTHER THING

02:31:31.048 --> 02:31:32.283
IS THAT YOU KNOW WE TALKED

02:31:32.349 --> 02:31:33.918
ABOUT THE CASELOAD INCREASE AND

02:31:33.984 --> 02:31:35.019
WE HAVE THIS DISPUTE ABOUT HOW

02:31:35.085 --> 02:31:36.687
MUCH MONEY WILL GET BUT- BUT

02:31:36.754 --> 02:31:38.122
ALSO POINT OUT THAT WITH THE

02:31:38.189 --> 02:31:39.390
CASELOAD INCREASE WE'RE GOING

02:31:39.457 --> 02:31:41.025
TO NEED MORE PROVIDERS. HE JUST

02:31:41.091 --> 02:31:44.762
HAVE PREVIOUSLY HEARD FROM THAT

02:31:44.829 --> 02:31:45.296
WORK WE ACTUALLY HAVE BOTH

02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:46.730
EXISTING. WHO ARE SUFFERING

02:31:46.797 --> 02:31:48.332
FINANCIAL LOSSES AND ACTUALLY

02:31:48.399 --> 02:31:49.800
TALK ABOUT CLOSING DOWN THE

02:31:49.867 --> 02:31:52.336
PRACTICE IS 30% ACCORDING TO A

02:31:52.403 --> 02:31:52.803
CALIFORNIA HEALTH CARE

02:31:52.870 --> 02:31:55.406
FOUNDATION SURVEY. SAME TIME-

YOU KNOW TRY TO GET MORE

02:31:57.575 --> 02:31:59.543
PROVIDERS IN MEDIC HOW- PAID

02:31:59.610 --> 02:32:01.378
THE LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM THAT

02:32:01.445 --> 02:32:02.613
WE HAD IS PERHAPS ONE OF OUR

02:32:02.680 --> 02:32:03.881
MOST SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS AND

02:32:03.948 --> 02:32:05.416
GETTING A PROVIDERS TO TAKE

02:32:05.483 --> 02:32:06.650
MEDICARE WHICH IS STILL A

02:32:06.717 --> 02:32:08.252
FAIRLY POOR PAYER DESPITE THE

02:32:08.319 --> 02:32:09.753
IMPROVEMENTS WE'VE MADE TO IT

02:32:09.820 --> 02:32:12.056
OVER THE YEARS THROUGH PROP

02:32:12.122 --> 02:32:12.623
FIFTY SIX THE ONES THAT WERE

02:32:12.690 --> 02:32:13.657
ELIMINATED BY THE WAY.

02:32:13.724 --> 02:32:15.759
PROPOSING TO ELIMINATE. THE

02:32:15.826 --> 02:32:20.498
THINGS THAT. HELPED US BOLSTER.

02:32:20.564 --> 02:32:23.167
I MORE PROVIDER FOR NOW BUT-

02:32:23.234 --> 02:32:24.969
EVEN SO THAT ASIDE I UNDERSTAND

02:32:25.035 --> 02:32:26.303
THAT- FIRST COHORT WHICH WILL

02:32:26.370 --> 02:32:28.105
CONTINUE TO BE FUNDED- ACTUALLY

02:32:28.172 --> 02:32:29.173
EVEN THOUGH THE REQUIREMENTS

02:32:29.240 --> 02:32:30.541
FOR MINIMUM 30% MEDIC HOW

02:32:30.608 --> 02:32:31.742
THEY'RE TAKING CARE OF LIKE

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:33.177
SIXTY OVER 60% MEDICAL

02:32:33.244 --> 02:32:35.379
PATIENTS- CERTAINLY OF.

02:32:35.446 --> 02:32:36.113
TREMENDOUS RETURN ON OUR

02:32:36.180 --> 02:32:38.616
INVESTMENT- I UNDERSTAND THAT

02:32:38.682 --> 02:32:40.117
IF WE HAD FUNDED AND YOU'RE

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:41.252
PROPOSING FOR ELIMINATION

02:32:41.318 --> 02:32:42.853
COHORT TO THAT WOULD PROBABLY

02:32:42.920 --> 02:32:44.321
COST ABOUT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

02:32:44.388 --> 02:32:45.356
BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY FOR FIVE

02:32:45.422 --> 02:32:46.490
YEARS BECAUSE THE FIVE YEAR

02:32:46.557 --> 02:32:47.925
REPAYMENT SO IN ANY ONE YEAR

02:32:47.992 --> 02:32:52.129
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE- ITS FIFTH

02:32:52.196 --> 02:32:53.898
ACT. SO TO ME IF YOU'RE GONNA

02:32:53.964 --> 02:32:55.900
HAVE A- GREAT YOU KNOW IT COULD

02:32:55.966 --> 02:32:57.001
CASELOAD INCREASE OF

02:32:57.067 --> 02:32:57.902
APPROXIMATELY TWO MILLION

02:32:57.968 --> 02:32:59.904
PEOPLE IN THE MEDIC HOW. WOULD

02:32:59.970 --> 02:33:01.305
YOU WANT TO TRY TO GET AS MANY

02:33:01.372 --> 02:33:03.340
DOCTORS AND OTHER PROVIDERS-

02:33:03.407 --> 02:33:06.243
DENTISTS ADDRESS TO BE WILLING

02:33:06.310 --> 02:33:08.045
TO TAKE THE MEDICARE PATIENTS.

02:33:08.112 --> 02:33:10.147
BECAUSE THERE IT'S- THREE

02:33:10.214 --> 02:33:13.083
THAT'S DOESN'T MAKE SENSE- WELL

02:33:13.150 --> 02:33:14.351
LET'S THINK ABOUT WHAT'S THE

02:33:14.418 --> 02:33:16.453
BEST WAY TO USE OUR MONEY SO-

02:33:16.520 --> 02:33:18.689
SHE WE TAKE IF WE IF WE USE

02:33:18.756 --> 02:33:20.724
THAT MONEY TO PAY FOR THE

02:33:20.791 --> 02:33:22.726
HEALTH OF THE LOAN REPAYMENTS-

02:33:22.793 --> 02:33:24.695
AND THEN YOU SPREAD OUT THAT

02:33:24.762 --> 02:33:27.998
REDUCTION DEAL THAT. THE LOSS

02:33:28.065 --> 02:33:29.066
OF THOSE I GUESS THAT

02:33:29.133 --> 02:33:30.367
REINVESTMENT AS FUNDS IN THAT

02:33:30.434 --> 02:33:33.003
OVER THE REST OF THE MEDICAL

02:33:33.070 --> 02:33:33.604
SYSTEM WHEN WE STILL COME OUT

02:33:33.671 --> 02:33:34.805
AHEAD. THE CONSIDERATION OF

02:33:34.872 --> 02:33:39.877
THAT. SO SENATOR PENN I DON'T

02:33:39.944 --> 02:33:43.981
KNOW THAT THE- YOU KNOW THE

02:33:44.048 --> 02:33:44.582
BUDGET REDUCTIONS PUT FORTH BY

02:33:44.648 --> 02:33:45.149
THE DEPARTMENT OUR DIFFICULT

02:33:45.215 --> 02:33:46.817
INDEED- JUST UNDERSCORE THE

02:33:46.884 --> 02:33:47.651
FACT THAT IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

02:33:47.718 --> 02:33:49.587
WE DON'T VALUE OUR OUR

02:33:49.653 --> 02:33:52.289
PHYSICIANS AND OUR OUR WOMEN'S

02:33:52.356 --> 02:33:53.123
HEALTH AND FAMILY PLANNING

02:33:53.190 --> 02:33:54.825
SERVICES- I THINK THEY WERE

02:33:54.892 --> 02:33:56.493
IT'S JUST DIFFICULT DECISIONS

02:33:56.560 --> 02:33:58.896
ACCORDING AND I THINK WE AND

02:33:58.963 --> 02:34:00.464
YOU KNOW PLAN TO ENGAGE WITH

02:34:00.531 --> 02:34:02.066
THE LEGISLATURE- OVER THE

02:34:02.132 --> 02:34:04.535
BUDGET DECISIONS AND I THINK

02:34:04.602 --> 02:34:06.136

ENSURE THAT WE HAVE ADEQUATE

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:17.581
ACCESS TO SERVICES- IT WHICH IS

02:34:17.648 --> 02:34:18.916
WHY WE WILL HAVE A HEIGHTENED

02:34:18.983 --> 02:34:20.551
REPORTING PIECES TO MAKE SURE

02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:22.252
WE ARE WATCHING THAT VERY

02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:24.254
CLOSELY TO THIS PROCESS AND-

02:34:24.321 --> 02:34:25.956

BECAUSE WE HAVE TO HAVE A

02:34:38.569 --> 02:34:39.870
BALANCED BUDGET BUT WE THINK

02:34:39.937 --> 02:34:41.271
ABOUT WHAT CUTS WE MAKE WE

02:38:46.250 --> 02:38:47.818
HOSPITALS WHICH I THINK IT WAS

02:38:47.885 --> 02:38:49.853
GONNA BE PROBLEMATIC AS WELL.

02:38:49.920 --> 02:38:51.288

IT'LL SAVE THE STATE GENERAL

02:39:07.271 --> 02:39:09.873
FUND. BUT THE COST OF THAT IS

02:39:09.940 --> 02:39:10.874
ACTUALLY PULLING EVEN MORE

02:39:10.941 --> 02:39:12.342

SAVINGS. THAT HAS A MUCHLARGER

02:39:43.707 --> 02:39:45.442
NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE TOTAL

VERY SHORT ON TIME AND- SO WHAT

I APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION-

02:57:20.896 --> 02:57:25.167
IT WILL GO. ON AND COMES FROM

02:57:25.234 --> 02:57:26.869
LA. CONSIDER BALANCE ON YOUR

02:57:26.936 --> 02:57:28.004
CREDIT FROM THE LEGISLATIVE

02:57:28.070 --> 02:57:30.606
ANALYST'S OFFICE I HAVE JUST

02:57:30.673 --> 02:57:32.708
THREE BRIEF COMMENTS- THE FIRST

02:57:32.775 --> 02:57:33.909
IS ABOUT THE BLACK INFANT

02:57:33.976 --> 02:57:35.177
HEALTH PROGRAM WHICH IS ON THE

02:57:35.244 --> 02:57:38.414
AGENDA. IT WASN'T DISCUSSED AS

02:57:38.481 --> 02:57:40.282
SPECIFICALLY VIA THE QUESTIONS.

02:57:40.349 --> 02:57:41.617
I'M AS YOU KNOW THIS PROGRAM

02:57:41.684 --> 02:57:43.819
MAKES EFFORTS TO REDUCE HEALTH

02:57:43.886 --> 02:57:46.088
DISPARITIES BETWEEN AFRICAN

02:57:46.155 --> 02:57:46.922
AMERICAN MOTHERS AND INFANTS

02:57:46.989 --> 02:57:49.091
AND- MOTHERS AND INFANTS IN

02:57:49.158 --> 02:57:51.193
OTHER RACIAL AND ETHNIC GROUPS.

02:57:51.260 --> 02:57:54.597
WE ALSO NOTE THIS TIME A COUPLE.

02:57:54.663 --> 02:57:56.632
DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE

02:57:56.699 --> 02:57:58.601
AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY SO

02:57:58.667 --> 02:58:00.403
WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT

02:58:00.469 --> 02:58:02.071
REMOVING FOR DOING IT OR A

02:58:02.138 --> 02:58:04.273
PROGRAM THAT. INTENTIONALLY

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:06.809
PLAYING IMPORTANT ROLE AT THIS.

02:58:06.876 --> 02:58:08.411
OUR SECOND COMMENT HAS TO DO

02:58:08.477 --> 02:58:12.348
WITH THE LABORATORY- THE

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:13.716
REQUEST FOR FUNDING FOR THE

02:58:13.783 --> 02:58:15.217
CENTER FOR LABORATORY SCIENCES

02:58:15.284 --> 02:58:17.920
AND WE JUST SIMPLY WOULD

02:58:17.987 --> 02:58:19.522
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:58:19.588 --> 02:58:21.123
DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION TO

02:58:21.190 --> 02:58:23.559
TRY TO SEEK FEMA FUNDS FOR

02:58:23.626 --> 02:58:25.928
ELIGIBLE COSTS AT LEAST IN THE

02:58:25.995 --> 02:58:28.864
FIRST YEAR IN TWENTY TWENTY

02:58:28.931 --> 02:58:30.399
TWENTY ONE. AND THEN OUR FINAL

02:58:30.466 --> 02:58:33.069
COMMENT WOULD JUST BE RELATED

02:58:33.135 --> 02:58:34.937
TO SOME OF THE SMALL LOANS FROM

02:58:35.004 --> 02:58:37.606
SPECIAL FUNDS AND- THAT SERVE

02:58:37.673 --> 02:58:38.240

HEALTH- THERE ARE THREE-

02:58:41.644 --> 02:58:43.079
SPECIAL FUNDS THAT WOULD

02:58:43.145 --> 02:58:45.614
PROVIDE THREE MILLION EACH TO

02:58:45.681 --> 02:58:47.883
THE GENERAL FUND. AND THESE

02:58:47.950 --> 02:58:49.151
THREE FUNDS ARE EACH RUNNING A

02:58:49.218 --> 02:58:51.320
STRUCTURAL DEFICIT AND WHILE

02:58:51.387 --> 02:58:54.423
THEIR FUND BALANCES IT APPEARED

02:58:54.490 --> 02:58:55.458
TO BE ABLE TO EASILY

02:58:55.524 --> 02:58:57.593

02:58:59.962 --> 02:59:01.097

PROGRAMMATIC IMPACTS IN THE OUT

02:59:02.998 --> 02:59:06.469

02:59:06.535 --> 02:59:08.504
RESULTING A SHORTAGE OF FUNDING

THE PROGRAM IS HAVING A

03:20:06.461 --> 03:20:08.129
DRAMATIC IMPACT FOR CONSUMERS

03:20:08.196 --> 03:20:09.697
BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX

03:20:09.764 --> 03:20:10.665
HUNDRED PERCENT. WHERE WE SAW

03:20:10.732 --> 03:20:12.533
ENROLLMENT OF OVER THIRTY

03:20:12.600 --> 03:20:13.501

HUNDRED DOLLARS PER HOUSEHOLD

THOUSAND DOLLARS ON AN

03:20:19.240 --> 03:20:21.109
ANNUALIZED BASIS. KEEP IN MIND

03:20:21.175 --> 03:20:23.144
THAT BASED ON THE ELIGIBILITY

03:20:23.211 --> 03:20:24.278
CURVE THAT WAS SET FOR THE

03:20:24.345 --> 03:20:25.747
PROGRAM BY THE COVER CALIFORNIA

03:20:25.813 --> 03:20:27.648
BOARD. OF THESE CONSUMERS EVEN

03:20:27.715 --> 03:20:29.217
AFTER THE SUBSIDIES ARE STILL

03:20:29.283 --> 03:20:31.085
SPENDING BETWEEN TEN AND

03:20:31.152 --> 03:20:32.487
EIGHTEEN PERCENT. OF THEIR-

03:20:32.553 --> 03:20:34.522
ANNUAL INCOME ON PREMIUMS IT'S

03:20:34.589 --> 03:20:36.157
REALLY A REFLECTION OF HOW HIGH

03:20:36.224 --> 03:20:37.692
THE COST OF COVERAGE THEY WERE

03:20:37.759 --> 03:20:40.428
FACING WAS BEFORE THIS PROGRAM.

03:20:40.495 --> 03:20:42.196
WHILE THE ESTIMATED ENROLLMENT

03:20:42.263 --> 03:20:44.632
AMONG THOSE WHO EARN LESS THAN

03:20:44.699 --> 03:20:46.067
4100% OF FEDERAL POVERTY IN THE

03:20:46.134 --> 03:20:47.769
STATE SUBSIDY PROGRAM. TRACKED

03:20:47.835 --> 03:20:50.471
PRETTY WELL TO WHAT WAS

03:20:50.538 --> 03:20:51.072
ESTIMATED ORIGINALLY. TAKE UP

03:20:51.139 --> 03:20:52.907
IN THE FOUR HUNDRED TO SIX

03:20:52.974 --> 03:20:53.908
HUNDRED GROUP HAS BEEN BOTH

03:20:53.975 --> 03:20:55.376
PICK UP AND- A GENERAL

03:20:55.443 --> 03:20:57.445
UNDERSTATEMENT THE SPENDING HAS

03:20:57.512 --> 03:20:59.680
BEEN LESS THAN WAS ANTICIPATED.

03:20:59.747 --> 03:21:00.848
THEY'RE REALLY TWO MAIN REASONS

03:21:00.915 --> 03:21:03.518
FOR THAT. FIRST THE TWENTY

03:21:03.584 --> 03:21:04.585
TWENTY ELIGIBILITY LEVELS WERE

03:21:04.652 --> 03:21:06.254
SET. BASED ON MODELING WE

03:21:06.320 --> 03:21:07.455
REALLY DIDN'T KNOW HOW MANY

03:21:07.522 --> 03:21:08.656
PEOPLE WOULD SIGN UP OR HOW

03:21:08.723 --> 03:21:09.791
MUCH THEY WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

03:21:09.857 --> 03:21:12.460
FOR. AND IF IT TURNS OUT BASED

03:21:12.527 --> 03:21:13.461
ON THE CURVE THAT WAS ADOPTED

03:21:13.528 --> 03:21:15.296
BY THE BOARD AND AGAIN THE

03:21:15.363 --> 03:21:16.864
LIMITS IN THIS EAR THAT YOU

03:21:16.931 --> 03:21:17.965
HAVE TO SPEND IF YOUR INCOME ON

03:21:18.032 --> 03:21:21.135
PREMIUMS TO BETWEEN TEN AND 18%

03:21:21.202 --> 03:21:22.103
OF YOUR INCOME. IT TURNED OUT

03:21:22.170 --> 03:21:23.104
THAT ABOUT HALF OF THE

03:21:23.171 --> 03:21:25.573
CONSUMERS WHO ENROLLED BETWEEN.

03:21:25.640 --> 03:21:26.641
FOUR HUNDRED AND 6100% OF

03:21:26.707 --> 03:21:28.209
FEDERAL POVERTY ARE ALREADY%

03:21:28.276 --> 03:21:30.111
ELIGIBLE FOR COVERAGE THAT.

03:21:30.178 --> 03:21:32.613
COSTS LESS THAN THAT CUT OFF AT

03:21:32.680 --> 03:21:34.081
TEN EIGHTEEN PERCENT. AND AS A

03:21:34.148 --> 03:21:35.817
RESULT THOSE CONSUMERS WERE NOT

03:21:35.883 --> 03:21:37.885
ABLE TO BENEFIT FROM A NEW

03:21:37.952 --> 03:21:39.620
STATE SUBSIDIES. THE SECOND

03:21:39.687 --> 03:21:41.322
REASON THAT ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN

03:21:41.389 --> 03:21:43.491
LOWER IS THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO

03:21:43.558 --> 03:21:45.326
EARNING THIS INCOME RANGE.

03:21:45.393 --> 03:21:46.894
ABOUT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED IN

03:21:46.961 --> 03:21:48.296
THE OFFER EXCHANGE AND COVER

03:21:48.362 --> 03:21:49.764
CALIFORNIA BELIEVES THERE ARE

03:21:49.831 --> 03:21:50.231
QUITE A FEW OF THESE

03:21:50.298 --> 03:21:52.333
INDIVIDUALS. WE THOUGHT THAT

03:21:52.400 --> 03:21:53.234
THEY WOULD SWITCH TO AVAIL

03:21:53.301 --> 03:21:55.236
THEMSELVES OF THE SUBSIDY ON

03:21:55.303 --> 03:21:57.505
EXCHANGE AND THAT REALLY BY AND

03:21:57.572 --> 03:21:59.707
LARGE HAS NOT HAPPENED. WE SEEN

03:21:59.774 --> 03:22:00.608
THAT IN THE MIDDLE OF OPEN

03:22:00.675 --> 03:22:02.109
ENROLLMENT WE WERE WORKING WITH

03:22:02.176 --> 03:22:03.177
OUR INSURER PARTNERS AND

03:22:03.244 --> 03:22:05.279
BROKERS THROUGHOUT THE STATE TO

03:22:05.346 --> 03:22:06.347
IDENTIFY SOME INTERVENTIONS TO

03:22:06.414 --> 03:22:08.616
ENCOURAGE. THOSE CONSUMERS TO

03:22:08.683 --> 03:22:09.650
TAKE UP THE THIS NEW FINANCIAL

03:22:09.717 --> 03:22:11.419
HELP. BUT WE HAD TO PUT THOSE

03:22:11.486 --> 03:22:12.720
EFFORTS ON HOLD IN LIGHT OF THE

03:22:12.787 --> 03:22:15.289
PAINT ENDEMIC. THE TWENTY

03:22:15.356 --> 03:22:15.957
TWENTY ONE ESTIMATES IN THE

03:22:16.023 --> 03:22:17.492
GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISE DO

03:22:17.558 --> 03:22:19.694
ANTICIPATE OUR RENEWAL OF THOSE

03:22:19.760 --> 03:22:21.128
EFFORTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY

03:22:21.195 --> 03:22:24.031
ONE OPEN ENROLLMENT. AND SO WE

03:22:24.098 --> 03:22:25.433
LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO

03:22:25.500 --> 03:22:26.234
WORK TO MAKE SURE ALL

03:22:26.300 --> 03:22:28.169
CALIFORNIANS WERE ELIGIBLE FOR

03:22:28.236 --> 03:22:30.071
THE SUBSIDY CAN BENEFIT. ONE

03:22:30.137 --> 03:22:31.172
ISSUES REALLY HAVE HEIGHTENED

03:22:31.239 --> 03:22:32.507
IMPORTANCE DURING THE RECESSION

03:22:32.573 --> 03:22:34.175
WHEN TOO MANY CALIFORNIANS ARE

03:22:34.242 --> 03:22:36.177
FINDING THAT THEIR INCOME. IS

03:22:36.244 --> 03:22:37.678
LESS THAN EXPECTED IT WOULD BE

03:22:37.745 --> 03:22:39.013
RECALLED THAT IN BOTH THE

03:22:39.080 --> 03:22:39.947
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT UNDER THE

03:22:40.014 --> 03:22:41.883
FEDERAL RULES IN THE STATE

03:22:41.949 --> 03:22:43.050
THAT'S THE PROGRAM. IF YOUR

03:22:43.117 --> 03:22:44.952
INCOME ENDS UP LOWER THAN YOU

03:22:45.019 --> 03:22:46.621
EXPECTED AT THE END OF THE YEAR

03:22:46.687 --> 03:22:47.355
WHEN YOU FIND THE FILE YOUR

03:22:47.421 --> 03:22:50.491
TAXES. YOU CAN ONLY CLAIM A

03:22:50.558 --> 03:22:52.460
STATE SUBSIDY OR OR FINANCIAL

03:22:52.527 --> 03:22:53.961

THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. I'M

03:22:59.333 --> 03:23:01.569
SO PLEASED TO ATTACKS TOGETHER.

03:23:01.636 --> 03:23:03.905
HAVE REDUCED STATE SPENDING ON

03:23:03.971 --> 03:23:05.973
ON THE STAGE OF THE PROGRAM AND

03:23:06.040 --> 03:23:07.542
ARE THE REASON THAT THE MAY

03:23:07.608 --> 03:23:09.510
REVISION PROPOSAL REFLECTS A

03:23:09.577 --> 03:23:10.578
SUBSTANTIAL SAVINGS OF ABOUT A

03:23:10.645 --> 03:23:11.846
HUNDRED. MILLION DOLLARS

03:23:11.913 --> 03:23:14.682
RELATIVE TO WHAT WAS. INCLUDED

QUESTION. FOUR FIVE. YEAH

03:23:29.964 --> 03:23:30.565
ABSOLUTELY SO WHAT IS A TO CAN

03:23:30.631 --> 03:23:31.532
TO GROW PROGRAM. AND WITH

03:23:31.599 --> 03:23:32.433
REGARD TO. WE HAD AN

03:23:32.500 --> 03:23:34.435
ANTICIPATED THAT IN EARLY APRIL

03:23:34.502 --> 03:23:34.936
WHEN THE ESTIMATES WERE

03:23:35.002 --> 03:23:36.170
PREPARED THE PREMIUMS MIGHT

03:23:36.237 --> 03:23:38.539
INCREASE BY OVER 10% IN TWENTY

03:23:38.606 --> 03:23:39.340
TWENTY ONE. BUT WITH THE

TO SEE THAT THE ESTIMATES FOR

03:23:44.445 --> 03:23:45.046
TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE ARE

03:23:45.112 --> 03:23:46.180
FALLING ON THE OTHER HAND IF

03:23:46.247 --> 03:23:47.682
THE RECESSION GROWTH. TAKE UP

03:23:47.748 --> 03:23:48.749
MAYBE INCREASING AND WE

03:23:48.816 --> 03:23:50.251
CONTINUE NOW ON THAT ISSUE.

04:50:34.683 --> 04:50:36.619
GIVEN THAT ONE WE WOULD REQUIRE

04:50:36.685 --> 04:50:38.254

ELIMINATIONS OF THE LEGISLATURE

04:50:50.366 --> 04:50:52.768
COULD CONSIDER IS RATHER THAN

04:50:52.835 --> 04:50:53.736
ELIMINATING THE PROGRAMS ALL

04:50:53.803 --> 04:50:55.805

ALL RIGHT AND THEN I THE. OTHER

04:57:22.324 --> 04:57:25.561
ISSUE DAY. AND A GUIDE RATE WE

04:57:25.627 --> 04:57:27.729
DISCUSS THAT EARLIER THIS BUT-

04:57:27.796 --> 04:57:29.565
HE OFFERS A AND THEN AND THAT'S

04:57:29.631 --> 04:57:35.304
P. I. OUT DC. I DON'T KNOW

04:57:35.370 --> 04:57:37.639
THERE'S ANY ESTIMATE FOR AGING.

04:57:37.706 --> 04:57:39.141
IN TERMS OF THE I. BECAUSE SO

04:57:39.208 --> 04:57:40.809
WE TAKE AWAY THIS PROGRAM WE

04:57:40.876 --> 04:57:42.611
HAVE HAVING PEOPLE. MAYBE NOT A

04:57:42.678 --> 04:57:43.712
HUNDRED AND IN A NURSING HOME

04:57:43.779 --> 04:57:45.047
BUT I HARD TO BELIEVE THAT ZERO

04:57:45.113 --> 04:57:46.582
AND UP TO THE NURSING. SO THESE

04:57:46.648 --> 04:57:48.784
ARE PEOPLE RIGHT HOME. AND ARE.

04:57:48.850 --> 04:57:52.554
SO WE ACCOUNT YEAH SO AGAIN. I

04:57:52.621 --> 04:57:54.489
DON'T THINK WE'RE COUNTING THAT

04:57:54.556 --> 04:57:56.858
OFFSET THE IN THE C. INTO OF

04:57:56.925 --> 04:57:58.293
THAT COST WILL OCCUR FROM

04:57:58.360 --> 04:57:59.361
ELIMINATING PROGRAM. BUT

04:57:59.428 --> 04:58:00.829
PERHAPS YOU SPEAK TO WHAT'S OF

04:58:00.896 --> 04:58:02.464
RESTARTING THESE PROGRAMS THAT

04:58:02.531 --> 04:58:03.432
YOU'RE PROPOSING TO SENSUALLY

04:58:03.498 --> 04:58:05.100
RICH ELIMINATE BOTH CBS AND

04:58:05.167 --> 04:58:10.038
MSSP. IF WE DO GET FEDERAL

04:58:10.105 --> 04:58:10.939
FUNDS WHAT KIND OF. EFFORT YOU

04:58:11.006 --> 04:58:11.607
KNOW WHAT WOULD IT TAKE

04:58:11.673 --> 04:58:12.975
ACTUALLY. THE PROGRAM AGAIN AS

04:58:13.041 --> 04:58:14.409
IT. GOING TO BE BETTER TO KEEP

04:58:14.476 --> 04:58:15.444
THEM. SINCE CAN'T REALLY CLOSE

04:58:15.510 --> 04:58:16.745
AND RIGHT AWAY UNLESS YOU

04:58:16.812 --> 04:58:17.846
REALLY PLAN TO TELL EVERYONE TO

04:58:17.913 --> 04:58:20.148
UNITE AND JULY FIRST WE JUST.

04:58:20.215 --> 04:58:21.750

04:58:21.817 --> 04:58:23.118
THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING WE'D

04:58:23.185 --> 04:58:24.820
ACTUALLY DO OR MAYBE I

04:58:24.886 --> 04:58:27.656
SHOULDN'T SAY THAT. IS THAT.

04:58:27.723 --> 04:58:29.157
WOULD MAKE MENTION OF THAT SO

04:58:29.224 --> 04:58:30.259
MAYBE AGING CAN ADDRESS THAT I

04:58:30.325 --> 04:58:33.495
MEAN. IF EVEN IF THIS WAS

04:58:33.562 --> 04:58:35.197
PASSED. ARE WE JUST. GONNA DO

04:58:35.264 --> 04:58:38.967
JULY FIRST. YES THE DEPARTMENT

04:58:39.034 --> 04:58:39.935
OF AGING HAS BEEN IN

04:58:40.002 --> 04:58:41.003
CONVERSATION WITH BOTH THE

04:58:41.069 --> 04:58:41.570
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE

04:58:41.637 --> 04:58:43.772
SERVICES- AND OUR LOCAL

04:58:43.839 --> 04:58:45.440
PROVIDER NETWORKS OF BOTH A

COMMUNITY BASED SERVICES AND

04:58:46.642 --> 04:58:48.543
MULTI PURPOSE ADULT SERVICES

04:58:48.610 --> 04:58:51.546
ABOUT- WHAT A TIME LINE WOULD

04:58:51.613 --> 04:58:52.781
BE AND YOU ARE CORRECT THAT IT

04:58:52.848 --> 04:58:54.316
WOULD TAKE SEVERAL MONTHS BOTH

04:58:54.383 --> 04:58:57.119
FROM A- REGULATORY PERSPECTIVE

04:58:57.185 --> 04:58:57.853
WORKING WITH THE FEDERAL

04:58:57.919 --> 04:58:59.955
PARTNER CMS YOU GET APPROVAL

04:59:00.022 --> 04:59:00.756
BUT ALSO FROM A HUMAN

04:59:00.822 --> 04:59:02.190
PERSPECTIVE HAVING TRANSITION

04:59:02.257 --> 04:59:03.759
PLANS FOR THE PEOPLE. WHO ARE

04:59:03.825 --> 04:59:07.262
BEING SERVED- AND THE CENTRIST

04:59:07.329 --> 04:59:08.463
THEMSELVES. IN OF THE LESSONS

04:59:08.530 --> 04:59:09.531
LEARNED FROM THE LAST TIME THE

04:59:09.598 --> 04:59:11.667
SHUT DOWN I WOULD. A DIRECTOR

04:59:11.733 --> 04:59:13.869
COURSE OF THOSE ASSOCIATIONS

04:59:13.935 --> 04:59:15.704
WHO CAN WHO CAN POWERFULLY TELL

04:59:15.771 --> 04:59:17.472
THE STORY OF THAT HISTORY BUT

04:59:17.539 --> 04:59:18.307
ALSO THE MASTER PLAN FOR AGING

04:59:18.373 --> 04:59:19.741
A SUBCOMMITTEE ON LONG TERM

04:59:19.808 --> 04:59:22.344
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS. I DID DO

04:59:22.411 --> 04:59:23.879
A REPORT. THE MANY

04:59:23.945 --> 04:59:25.013
RECOMMENDATIONS INCLUDING

04:59:25.080 --> 04:59:26.315
STRENGTHENING THESE NETWORKS

04:59:26.381 --> 04:59:27.349
AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT THEY

04:59:27.416 --> 04:59:30.419
CITE IS THAT- IT HAS TAKEN

04:59:30.485 --> 04:59:32.387
ABOUT A DECADE TO REBUILD. ON

04:59:32.454 --> 04:59:34.756
THE NETWORK SO THESE ARE AGAIN-

04:59:34.823 --> 04:59:36.591
EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT

04:59:36.658 --> 04:59:38.593
CONVERSATIONS AND- TRADE OFFS

04:59:38.660 --> 04:59:39.594
AND I BELIEVE OUR FINANCE

04:59:39.661 --> 04:59:41.596
COLLEAGUES CAN SPEAK TO WHETHER

04:59:41.663 --> 04:59:43.665
THOSE. OTHER COSTS YOU MENTION

04:59:43.732 --> 04:59:45.300
THIS MORNING AGAIN RACE HERE

04:59:45.367 --> 04:59:50.072
ARE ARE IN THE ESTIMATE. OKAY

04:59:50.138 --> 04:59:58.947
FRAN. YES CONSISTENT WITH WHAT

04:59:59.014 --> 05:00:01.483
OUR COLLEAGUE AT THE ACS AND JC

05:00:01.550 --> 05:00:08.056
COOPER OTHER COSTS FOR- ALSO.

05:00:08.123 --> 05:00:09.658
ARE NOT BUILT TEN NOW WE DON'T

05:00:09.725 --> 05:00:12.194
KNOW THAT NUMBER WOULD BE AN

05:00:12.260 --> 05:00:13.862
IT'S IN THE BUDGET OR CURRENTLY.

05:00:13.929 --> 05:00:16.598
NOTHING OR PERCENT OKAY WELL I

05:00:16.665 --> 05:00:18.133
WOULD SO SOUNDS LIKE WE MORE I

05:00:18.200 --> 05:00:19.601
READING OF WHAT THE TWO SAVINGS

05:00:19.668 --> 05:00:20.802
WE BE IF WE TOOK SO A POLICY

05:00:20.869 --> 05:00:22.437
SET UP WITH I NOT SURE A GOOD I

05:00:22.504 --> 05:00:24.473
BUT MORE ACT. WE NEED TO BE IN

05:00:24.539 --> 05:00:26.007
THE TRANSIT TIME WHERE WE HAVE

05:00:26.074 --> 05:00:26.975
CONTINUED FUNDING WE NEED TO

05:00:27.042 --> 05:00:28.744
BUILD IN THE OFFSET. OF THE

05:00:28.810 --> 05:00:30.445
COSTS TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

05:00:30.512 --> 05:00:31.980
WE'RE REALLY REALLY TRULY END

05:00:32.047 --> 05:00:33.115
UP IN TERMS OF SAVINGS IT MAY

05:00:33.181 --> 05:00:34.383
TURN OUT THAT IT'S NOT ACTUALLY

05:00:34.449 --> 05:00:36.585
WORTH THE EFFORT. TO ELIMINATE

05:00:36.651 --> 05:00:38.053
THE PROGRAM FROM A BUT EVEN

05:00:38.120 --> 05:00:39.421
FROM A SIMPLY BUDGETARY POINT

05:00:39.488 --> 05:00:40.722
OF VIEW I THINK MY POLICY POINT

05:00:40.789 --> 05:00:41.523
OF VIEW THERE'S A LOT OF

05:00:41.590 --> 05:00:42.724
REASONS TO SAY WHY THIS WOULD

05:00:42.791 --> 05:00:43.892
BE A BAD IDEA BUT EVEN FROM A

05:00:43.959 --> 05:00:44.926
BUDGETARY STANDPOINT WE NEED TO

05:00:44.993 --> 05:00:51.833
HAVE AN ACCURATE ACCOUNTING. OF.

05:00:51.900 --> 05:00:52.367
WHAT WE SHOULD DO WE COULD

05:00:52.434 --> 05:00:52.934
REALLY EXPECT. SO OKAY ANY

05:00:53.001 --> 05:00:55.437

TO JUST MAKE A CAR. POINT SO ON

05:02:35.537 --> 05:02:38.106
THESE HOLE ON SEO IT TALKS

THAT ACTUALLY IT'S TWO HUNDRED

05:02:50.151 --> 05:02:50.819
THIRTY NINE THE- GENERAL FUND

STANDARDIZING SERVICE AS- AND

05:03:05.700 --> 05:03:07.669
SO ON ME DAY THAT THE APPROACH

05:03:07.736 --> 05:03:09.371
THAT WE TOOK IN IDENTIFYING THE

05:03:09.437 --> 05:03:10.672
STATUS FOR THE TWO HUNDRED

05:03:10.739 --> 05:03:11.673
THIRTY MILLION. WE'VE

05:03:11.740 --> 05:03:12.841
IDENTIFIED THREE DIFFERENT TIER

05:03:12.908 --> 05:03:14.709
LEVELS IT WAS INFORMED BY THE

05:03:14.776 --> 05:03:17.379
RATE STUDY THAT WAS UPDATED AND

05:03:17.445 --> 05:03:19.414
RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR. AND

05:03:19.481 --> 05:03:21.483
BASED ON THAT WE IDENTIFIED

05:03:21.550 --> 05:03:23.118
THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT

05:03:23.184 --> 05:03:23.952
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

05:03:24.019 --> 05:03:26.154
GREATEST AMOUNT OF INCREASES.

05:03:26.221 --> 05:03:29.057
THEREFORE GIVEN AN INDICATION

05:03:29.124 --> 05:03:30.458
OF THE DELTA BETWEEN WHAT THEIR

05:03:30.525 --> 05:03:32.227
CURRENT RATE IS AND THEN HOW

05:03:32.294 --> 05:03:34.663
MUCH THEY WOULD BE NEEDING TO-

05:03:34.729 --> 05:03:36.498
HAD IS AN INCREASE THOSE THAT

05:03:36.565 --> 05:03:37.599
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THE

05:03:37.666 --> 05:03:38.500
GREATEST AMOUNT OF INCREASE FOR

05:03:38.567 --> 05:03:39.501
THOSE THAT ARE IDENTIFIED AS

05:03:39.568 --> 05:03:41.369
NEEDING THAT- THE GREATEST

05:03:41.436 --> 05:03:43.004
RELEASE- ON A PAYMENT

05:03:43.071 --> 05:03:45.473
REDUCTION. AND THEREFORE THEY

05:03:45.540 --> 05:03:46.541
WOULD BE THE PROVIDERS THAT

05:03:46.608 --> 05:03:48.076
WOULD BE RECEIVING A SEVEN

05:03:48.143 --> 05:03:50.045
POINT. FIVE PERCENT- PAYMENT

05:03:50.111 --> 05:03:53.381
REDUCTION AND- GROUPS WE HAVE

05:03:53.448 --> 05:03:54.583
OUR LIVES IT JUST TURNED OFF

05:03:54.649 --> 05:03:55.884
SORRY ABOUT THAT. AND THEN THE

05:03:55.951 --> 05:03:58.887
ELEVEN POINT 5% WAS- FOR THOSE

05:03:58.954 --> 05:04:00.722
IN THE MID RANGE AND THEN FOR

05:04:00.789 --> 05:04:03.258
THOSE SERVICE PROVIDERS- THAT

05:04:03.325 --> 05:04:05.860
WERE IDENTIFIED AS EITHER

05:04:05.927 --> 05:04:08.163
RESEEDING- HELLO UP FIVE

05:04:08.229 --> 05:04:09.864
PERCENT. INCREASE AT THE

05:04:09.931 --> 05:04:12.434
UPDATED RATE STUDY REFLECTED OR

05:04:12.500 --> 05:04:14.235
ACTUALLY HAD A DECREASE THEY

05:04:14.302 --> 05:04:22.744
WERE- GOING. TO BE RECEIVING A

05:04:22.811 --> 05:04:24.279
GREATER LEVEL I THAT YEAR FORT

05:04:24.346 --> 05:04:27.248
PER AND CLARIFY. THE EIGHT

05:04:27.315 --> 05:04:27.983

ACTUALLY DO MODIFY THOSE. THREE

05:05:05.320 --> 05:05:06.621
DIFFERENT SERVICE CODES TO

05:05:06.688 --> 05:05:08.089
ACCOUNT FOR THAT EIGHT POINT

05:05:08.156 --> 05:05:10.091
TWO PERCENT- AND SO THEY WOULD

05:05:10.158 --> 05:05:12.761
HAVE EIGHT EIGHT. RELATED

05:05:12.827 --> 05:05:14.496
REDUCTION AND THEREFORE THERE

05:05:14.562 --> 05:05:16.598
ARE- PAYMENT REDUCTION WOULD

05:05:16.665 --> 05:05:18.867
BE- FACTORING THAT EIGHT POINT

TRENDS- I WANT TO ALSO MAKE

05:05:34.049 --> 05:05:34.783
NOTE THAT THE EXPENDITURE

05:05:34.849 --> 05:05:36.685
TRENDS AND ALSO UTILIZATION

05:05:36.751 --> 05:05:37.986
REVIEW AS A PART OF THAT

05:05:38.053 --> 05:05:38.753
SEVENTY MILLION THAT WE'RE

05:05:38.820 --> 05:05:41.956
IDENTIFYING- WE DO HAVE

05:05:42.023 --> 05:05:42.991

05:05:45.326 --> 05:05:45.827
TWENTY ONE FOR THE EFFECTIVE

05:05:45.894 --> 05:05:47.328
DATE. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

05:05:47.395 --> 05:05:48.263
WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

05:05:48.329 --> 05:05:49.864
START IDENTIFYING SAVINGS THIS

05:05:49.931 --> 05:05:52.167
YEAR- AS I NOTED THERE'S THREE

05:05:52.233 --> 05:05:53.201
DIFFERENT AREAS IN WHICH WE'RE

05:05:53.268 --> 05:05:55.236
GOING TO BE TARGETING- THAT

05:05:55.303 --> 05:05:56.571
SEVENTY MILLION AND IDENTIFIED

05:05:56.638 --> 05:05:58.440
SAVINGS. THE FIRST A

05:05:58.506 --> 05:05:59.607
STANDARDIZATION OF TARGETED

05:05:59.674 --> 05:06:01.676
SERVICES SO WE DO KNOW THAT

05:06:01.743 --> 05:06:03.211
THERE'S BEEN A COUPLE OF THINGS

05:06:03.278 --> 05:06:05.513
THAT WE'VE SEEN THAT OUR TRENDS

05:06:05.580 --> 05:06:08.249
FOR SERVICES. THAT ARE ACROSS

05:06:08.316 --> 05:06:09.017
THE STATE FAMILIES HAVE HAD

05:06:09.084 --> 05:06:10.051
SOME GOOD. ABOUT

05:06:10.118 --> 05:06:12.787
INCONSISTENCIES RACIAL CENTERS

05:06:12.854 --> 05:06:14.055
AND DIFFERENT POLICIES AND I'LL

05:06:14.122 --> 05:06:16.057
GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE FOR RESPITE

05:06:16.124 --> 05:06:23.998
WE BELIEVE BY TAKING A LOOK AT

05:06:24.065 --> 05:06:26.835
HOW WE INSTEAD. SPITZER AS MY

05:06:26.901 --> 05:06:28.570
TO. THAT THAT WOULD BE A TO

05:06:28.636 --> 05:06:30.004
AFFECT SOME SAVING. BUT ALSO BE

05:06:30.071 --> 05:06:30.772
ABLE TO SOME TRY. AND CLEAR

05:06:30.839 --> 05:06:33.041
INTO SERVICE. OF THOSE SIR. THE

05:06:33.108 --> 05:06:33.641
OTHER ONE IS TAKE A LOOK AT A

05:06:33.708 --> 05:06:35.910
FISH SEES WE DO KNOW THAT FROM

05:06:35.977 --> 05:06:37.645
THE RISK. WHEN WE HAD OTHER

05:06:37.712 --> 05:06:38.646
SAVING MEASURES AT THEIR WORST

05:06:38.713 --> 05:06:40.648
GROUP THAT WENT FORWARD THAT WE

05:06:40.715 --> 05:06:41.850
WERE ABLE TO IDENTIFY SOME

05:06:41.916 --> 05:06:43.251
SAVINGS. WE BELIEVE

05:06:43.318 --> 05:06:44.552
IMPLEMENTING SOME OF THOSE

05:06:44.619 --> 05:06:46.387
THAT- ALLOW FOR GREATER

05:06:46.454 --> 05:06:49.023
FLEXIBILITY WILL ALSO BE ABLE

05:06:49.090 --> 05:06:50.425
TO ACHIEVE SOME SAVINGS AN

05:06:50.492 --> 05:06:52.093
EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE THE

05:06:52.160 --> 05:06:53.595
TABOR DAY SERVICE SAYS. THIS IS

05:06:53.661 --> 05:06:55.130
WHERE YOU HAVE AN INDIVIDUAL

05:06:55.196 --> 05:06:57.031
WHO CAN HAVE A PERSON CENTERED

05:06:57.098 --> 05:06:59.234
APPROACH TO THEIR DAY- AND SO

05:06:59.300 --> 05:07:01.202
IT CAN BE- BASED ON IF THEY'RE

05:07:01.269 --> 05:07:03.738
RECEIVING- SIX HOURS A DAY OF

05:07:03.805 --> 05:07:05.573
SERVICE DURING THE WEEK THEY

05:07:05.640 --> 05:07:06.875
MAY ACTUALLY HAVE A MUCH.

05:07:06.941 --> 05:07:08.777
REDUCED NUMBER OF HOURS SERVICE

05:07:08.843 --> 05:07:13.815
BUT THE FLEXIBILITY. TO BE ABLE

05:07:13.882 --> 05:07:15.083
TO. A DRIVE THEIR DATA TO HOW

05:07:15.150 --> 05:07:15.750
THEY WANT TO HAVE THEIR SERVICE.

05:07:15.817 --> 05:07:17.418
WOULD ABOUT TO THE- THIS IS

05:07:17.485 --> 05:07:17.919
PARTICULARLY INTERESTING

05:07:17.986 --> 05:07:20.355
BECAUSE A COUPLE AS WERE HOW TO

05:07:20.421 --> 05:07:21.990
TAKE A LOOK AT THE KHAN.

05:07:22.056 --> 05:07:22.757
SETTINGS AND REDUCING THE

05:07:22.824 --> 05:07:24.726
EXPOSURE OF INDIVIDUALS. THIS

05:07:24.793 --> 05:07:26.261
IS- LIKELY GOING TO BE AN

05:07:26.327 --> 05:07:27.362
OPTION THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE

05:07:27.428 --> 05:07:28.696
ABLE TO EXPLORE NOT ONLY FOR

05:07:28.763 --> 05:07:30.298
COST SAVING MEASURES BUT ALSO

05:07:30.365 --> 05:07:31.966
FOR THE SAFETY OF INDIVIDUALS.

05:07:32.033 --> 05:07:33.201
AS WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

05:07:33.268 --> 05:07:34.736
HOW TO NAVIGATE- LARGER

05:07:34.803 --> 05:07:36.971
CONGREGATE SETTINGS. THE FINAL

05:07:37.038 --> 05:07:38.640
ONE IS ON UTILIZATION. FOR

05:07:38.706 --> 05:07:40.742
INDIVIDUALS- FOR UTILIZATION

05:07:40.809 --> 05:07:42.744
AND SERVICE UTILIZATION WE HAVE

05:07:42.811 --> 05:07:44.078
SEEN AN INCREASE OF OUR AVERAGE

05:07:44.145 --> 05:07:46.080
COST PER CONSUMER WE CERTAINLY

05:07:46.147 --> 05:07:47.749
RECOGNIZE THAT MUCH OF THAT HAS

05:07:47.816 --> 05:07:49.484
TO DO WITH THE COMPLEXITY OF

05:07:49.551 --> 05:07:50.518
THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS THAT

05:07:50.585 --> 05:07:54.422
WE SERVE. BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE

05:07:54.489 --> 05:07:54.956
BY TAKING A LOOK AT. THE

05:07:55.023 --> 05:07:55.523
UTILIZATION PARTICULAR FOR

05:07:55.590 --> 05:07:56.691
THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN OUR

05:07:56.758 --> 05:07:58.326
HIGHEST COST. ON AN ANNUAL

05:07:58.393 --> 05:08:00.495
BASIS- FOR THE FIRST TIME IN

05:08:00.562 --> 05:08:02.030
THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE'VE

05:08:02.096 --> 05:08:04.365
ACTUALLY STARTED SCENE AND- A

05:08:04.432 --> 05:08:06.501
COUPLE OF INDIVIDUALS AND QUITE

05:08:06.568 --> 05:08:08.002
A FEW THAT ARE ACTUALLY GOING

05:08:08.069 --> 05:08:09.037
OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND

05:08:09.103 --> 05:08:11.239
DOLLARS A YEAR. IN EXPENDITURES

05:08:11.306 --> 05:08:12.040
AND WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO TAKE

05:08:12.106 --> 05:08:13.474
A LOOK AT NOT TO REMOVE THE

05:08:13.541 --> 05:08:15.543
SAFETY. NOT TO REMOVE THE

05:08:15.610 --> 05:08:17.278
SUPPORTS THAT ARE NECESSARY BUT

05:08:17.345 --> 05:08:19.447
BUILDING AND- A REVIEW TO MAKE

05:08:19.514 --> 05:08:21.349
SURE THAT ON AN ONGOING BASIS

05:08:21.416 --> 05:08:22.750
IF THE SUPPORTS ARE NEEDED ON

05:08:22.817 --> 05:08:24.452
GOING THAT WE'RE TAKING A LOOK.

05:08:24.519 --> 05:08:26.855
AND TO VERIFY THAT THOSE

05:08:26.921 --> 05:08:27.789
SERVICES AND SUPPORTS ARE

05:08:27.856 --> 05:08:30.458
NEEDED- FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS.

05:08:30.525 --> 05:08:31.659
I'M WORKING WITH REGIONAL

05:08:31.726 --> 05:08:33.761
CENTERS ON THE PLANS WE DO HAVE

05:08:33.828 --> 05:08:35.563
EXPENDITURE TRENDS THAT WE WANT

05:08:35.630 --> 05:08:37.365
SOME- TAKE A LOOK AT THOSE WE

05:08:37.432 --> 05:08:38.633
MOVE FORWARD THOSE ARE THE

05:08:38.700 --> 05:08:39.200
THINGS THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

05:08:39.267 --> 05:08:40.835
IDENTIFYING. IS THAT WHAT ARE

05:08:40.902 --> 05:08:42.470
THOSE EXPENDITURE TRENDS THAT

05:08:42.537 --> 05:08:44.939
ARE OUTSIDE OF. THINGS THAT CAN

05:08:45.006 --> 05:08:46.574
BE EXPLAINED BASED ON POLICY OR

05:08:46.641 --> 05:08:48.376
THINGS THAT CAN BE EXPLAINED

05:08:48.443 --> 05:08:50.511
BASED ON CASE LAW CHANGES- WE

05:08:50.578 --> 05:08:51.813
KNOW THAT WE HAVE INDIVIDUALS

05:08:51.880 --> 05:08:54.115
WHO ARE MOVING FROM SCHOOL AGE

05:08:54.182 --> 05:08:55.683
TO EDUCATION. THAT OFTEN TRY

05:08:55.750 --> 05:08:57.552
AND STRIPES ARE ARE TRENDS IN

05:08:57.619 --> 05:08:59.153
OUR CHANGES AND EXPENDITURES.

05:08:59.220 --> 05:09:00.221
BUT IF WE'RE STARTING TO SEE

05:09:00.288 --> 05:09:01.789
THINGS- BASED ON THOSE

05:09:01.856 --> 05:09:03.024
EXPENDITURES BY REGIONAL

05:09:03.091 --> 05:09:04.125
CENTERS THAT CANNOT BE

05:09:04.192 --> 05:09:05.593
EXPLAINED. THAT IS WHERE WE'RE

05:09:05.660 --> 05:09:06.761
GONNA WANT TO FOCUS THE

05:09:06.828 --> 05:09:08.630
REGIONAL CENTERS- PLANS AND

05:09:08.696 --> 05:09:10.198
IDENTIFYING EXPLAINING THAT AND

05:09:10.265 --> 05:09:11.766
THEN- BUILDING A PLAN TO BE

05:09:11.833 --> 05:09:13.735
ABLE TO MITIGATE. ANYTHING THAT

05:09:13.801 --> 05:09:19.474
IS NOT. NECESSARY OUTSIDE OF

05:09:19.540 --> 05:09:21.409
POLICY. AND NEEDS OF END OF

05:09:21.476 --> 05:09:22.477
CERTAINLY. THE CONCERN AS WE

05:09:22.543 --> 05:09:23.711
MOVE OPERATE. WITH A PROPOSED

05:09:23.778 --> 05:09:25.613
FOR THE RE. OF OPERATE. FOR THE

05:09:25.680 --> 05:09:28.216
REGIONAL CENTERS OUR PROPOSAL

05:09:28.283 --> 05:09:29.384
AS A REDUCTION IN GENERAL FUND

05:09:29.450 --> 05:09:30.952
OF THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS TOTAL

05:09:31.019 --> 05:09:33.554
FUND OF FORTY MILLION- WE

05:09:33.621 --> 05:09:35.290
RECOGNIZE THAT THE HEART AND

05:09:35.356 --> 05:09:36.824
THE THAT THE FOCUS OF WHAT WE

05:09:36.891 --> 05:09:38.626
DO. FIRST SERVING INDIVIDUALS

05:09:38.693 --> 05:09:39.661
IT'S REALLY ABOUT THE SERVICE

05:09:39.727 --> 05:09:42.096
COORDINATORS. AND A VERY LARGE

05:09:42.163 --> 05:09:43.765
SHERRIN PORTION OTHER REGIONAL

05:09:43.831 --> 05:09:45.166
CENTER BUDGET. IS WITH THE

05:09:45.233 --> 05:09:47.368
SERVICE COORDINATION- WE DO

05:09:47.435 --> 05:09:49.270
KNOW HOWEVER THAT. IN TAKING A

05:09:49.337 --> 05:09:51.439
LOOK AT THIS CURRENT YEAR- FOR

05:09:51.506 --> 05:09:53.608
ME REVISED. WE HAVE PROPOSED

05:09:53.675 --> 05:09:56.444
FOR BUDGET YEAR- THE GROWTH OF

05:09:56.511 --> 05:09:57.512
EIGHTEEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS.

05:09:57.578 --> 05:09:59.480
THAT WE ANTICIPATE GROWING

05:09:59.547 --> 05:10:01.816
ABOVE OUR CURRENT- CASELOAD-

05:10:01.883 --> 05:10:04.786
AND WE DO HAVE PROPOSED IN THE-MAY REVISED TO BE ABLE TO

05:10:04.852 --> 05:10:06.621
SUPPORT THAT CASE ON GROWTH. WE

05:10:06.688 --> 05:10:08.556
ALSO HAVE- PROPOSED TO SUPPORT

05:10:08.623 --> 05:10:09.924
THE EXPENDITURE GROWTH THAT

05:10:09.991 --> 05:10:12.393
GOES ALONG WITH THAT- AGAIN NOT

05:10:12.460 --> 05:10:14.162
MINIMIZING THE IMPACT OF A

05:10:14.228 --> 05:10:15.530
REDUCTION OF THIRTY MILLION

05:10:15.596 --> 05:10:16.698
DOLLARS IT DOES REPRESENT

05:10:16.764 --> 05:10:18.666
BETWEEN FOUR AND FIVE PERCENT.

05:10:18.733 --> 05:10:20.535
OF THE REGIONAL CENTER CASE.

05:10:20.601 --> 05:10:21.970
REGIONAL CENTER OPERATIONS

05:10:22.036 --> 05:10:24.205
DOLLARS- CERTAINLY MEANINGFUL

05:10:24.272 --> 05:10:26.040
BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE BASED ON

05:10:26.107 --> 05:10:27.008
THAT AND BASED ON THE OTHER

05:10:27.075 --> 05:10:28.042
SUPPORTS THAT HAVE BEEN PUT

05:10:28.109 --> 05:10:30.278
INTO- THE REGIONAL CENTER

05:10:30.345 --> 05:10:31.646
BUDGET THIS NEXT YEAR THAT THAT

05:10:31.713 --> 05:10:32.914
WOULD BE ACHIEVABLE WITHOUT

05:10:32.981 --> 05:10:34.816
REDUCING SERVICE COORDINATORS.

05:10:34.882 --> 05:10:37.452
THIS WILL TAKE SOME- HARD WORK

05:10:37.518 --> 05:10:38.519
BY REGIONAL CENTERS IN LOOKING

05:10:38.586 --> 05:10:39.787
AT THEIR EXPENDITURES

05:10:39.854 --> 05:10:42.824
IDENTIFYING WAYS- TO BE ABLE TO

05:10:42.890 --> 05:10:44.359
ACHIEVE THOSE SAVINGS. ALONG

05:10:44.425 --> 05:10:45.927
WITH AN EXPENDITURE PLAN WE'RE

05:10:45.994 --> 05:10:47.128
GOING TO BE ASKING REGIONAL

05:10:47.195 --> 05:10:47.996
CENTERS TO SUBMIT TO THE

05:10:48.062 --> 05:10:49.964
DEPARTMENT AN OPERATIONS PLAN

05:10:50.031 --> 05:10:51.599
THAT'S GOING TO BE IDENTIFYING.

05:10:51.666 --> 05:10:52.734
HOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE

05:10:52.800 --> 05:10:54.202
ACHIEVING THOSE SAVINGS BECAUSE

05:10:54.268 --> 05:10:55.236
WE ARE ALSO GOING TO WANT TO

ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE HEALTH

05:12:34.735 --> 05:12:36.637
THROUGH INSTITUTIONAL DEMAND.

05:12:36.704 --> 05:12:38.973
SO IT'S NOT INCOME ELIGIBLE BUT

05:12:39.040 --> 05:12:40.741
ON GETTING THEM ON MEDIC HOW

05:12:40.808 --> 05:12:42.276
BASED ON INTEREST INSTITUTIONAL

05:12:42.343 --> 05:12:44.612
DEMAND AT THAT POINT. WE DO

05:12:44.679 --> 05:12:46.714
HAVE ABOUT FORTY THREE THOUSAND

05:12:46.781 --> 05:12:48.816
INDIVIDUALS THAT- REALLY MAY

05:12:48.883 --> 05:12:51.052
QUALIFY WE RECOGNIZE THAT NOT

05:12:51.119 --> 05:12:53.488
ALL OF THEM WELL- WE ALSO HEARD

05:12:53.554 --> 05:12:55.323
FROM ADVOCATES THAT MUCH OF THE

05:12:55.389 --> 05:12:57.024
CONCERN AS THE COMPLEXITIES OF

05:12:57.091 --> 05:12:58.759
COMPLETING THAT AND NOT WANTING

05:12:58.826 --> 05:13:00.094
TO HAVE. A UNINTENDED

05:13:00.161 --> 05:13:01.662
CONSEQUENCE OF PEOPLE NOT

05:13:01.729 --> 05:13:03.498
RECEIVING SERVICES IF THEY

05:13:03.564 --> 05:13:04.298
DON'T COMPLETE THAT

05:13:04.365 --> 05:13:06.334
APPLICATION. WE DO BELIEVE THAT

05:13:06.400 --> 05:13:07.969
IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO

05:13:08.035 --> 05:13:08.569
MAXIMIZE FEDERAL DOLLARS

05:13:08.636 --> 05:13:11.072
PRICKLY AT THIS TIME. SO WE DO

05:13:11.139 --> 05:13:12.840
WANT TO WORK WITH OUR ADVOCATES

05:13:12.907 --> 05:13:14.142
WE'VE ALREADY STARTED A SMALL

05:13:14.208 --> 05:13:15.910
WORKGROUP. IDENTIFYING WAYS

05:13:15.977 --> 05:13:17.478
THAT WE CAN HELP FAMILIES TO

05:13:17.545 --> 05:13:19.580
MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO

05:13:19.647 --> 05:13:21.182
NAVIGATE THE PROCESS OF THE

05:13:21.249 --> 05:13:22.617
APPLICATION AND WE CAN REMOVE

05:13:22.683 --> 05:13:25.353
THOSE BARRIERS- TWO THINGS ON

05:13:25.419 --> 05:13:27.188
THAT ONE IS THAT IF WE CAN DO

05:13:27.255 --> 05:13:27.722
TRAINING WAS SERVICE

05:13:27.788 --> 05:13:29.223
COORDINATORS MAYBE TRAINING WAS

05:13:29.290 --> 05:13:32.026
STATE COUNCIL REGIONAL OFFICES-

05:13:32.093 --> 05:13:33.561
LOOKING AT OUR COMMUNITY BASED

05:13:33.628 --> 05:13:35.463
ORGANIZATIONS. SO WE CAN HAVE

05:13:35.530 --> 05:13:37.265
OUR FAMILY RESOURCE CENTERS TO

05:13:37.331 --> 05:13:39.066
BE THERE TO SUPPORT FAMILIES.

05:13:39.133 --> 05:13:40.801
BUT ALSO THE CONCERN IS THAT

05:13:40.868 --> 05:13:42.436
THERE IS NOT A DUE PROCESS TO

05:13:42.503 --> 05:13:44.639
BE ABLE TO HELP FOR FAMILIES IF

05:13:44.705 --> 05:13:45.940
THEY DISAGREE WITH THOSE ARE

05:13:46.007 --> 05:13:47.141
ACTUALLY AS WE HAVE BROAD

05:13:47.208 --> 05:13:48.409
AUTHORITY WE HAVE BROAD

05:13:48.476 --> 05:13:50.678
LANGUAGE IN OUR STATUTE. FOR

05:13:50.745 --> 05:13:52.213
THE FAMILIES THAT CAN END

05:13:52.280 --> 05:13:54.482
CONSUMERS CAN APPEAL- ANY

05:13:54.549 --> 05:13:56.083
DECISION BY THE REGIONAL CENTER

05:13:56.150 --> 05:13:57.285
AND THIS WOULD FALL UNDER THAT

05:13:57.351 --> 05:14:00.087
STATUTE. I'M SO HAPPY TO ANSWER

05:14:00.154 --> 05:14:01.122
ANY QUESTIONS ON ANY OF THESE

05:14:01.189 --> 05:14:03.591

THROUGH BUT FOR. THAT WAS. I'M

05:14:22.109 --> 05:14:23.477
THE FIRST IS THAT IT'LL BE

05:14:23.544 --> 05:14:26.881
REALLY. TO KEEP AN EYE ON. THE

05:14:26.948 --> 05:14:28.883
COMBINED EFFECTS OF ALL OF THE

05:14:28.950 --> 05:14:30.117
VARIOUS ACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

05:14:30.184 --> 05:14:32.453
PROPOSED ON THE INDIVIDUALS

05:14:32.520 --> 05:14:34.088

05:14:34.155 --> 05:14:35.756
DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES SH

05:14:35.823 --> 05:14:38.893
SO FOR EXAMPLE- THERE ARE

05:14:38.960 --> 05:14:40.962
PROPOSALS TO REDUCE. PAYMENTS

05:14:41.028 --> 05:14:43.097

SUPPLEMENTAL PROVIDER RATES

05:14:56.377 --> 05:14:57.144
THAT WENT INTO EFFECT IN

05:14:57.211 --> 05:14:59.146
JANUARY. AND TO INCREASE

05:14:59.213 --> 05:15:01.749
FUNDING- RELATED TO COSTS

05:15:01.816 --> 05:15:03.618
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CODE

THE TRANSITION TO RE OPENING-

05:15:24.505 --> 05:15:32.346
ONCE. ONCE IT'S DEEMED SAFE.

05:15:32.413 --> 05:15:33.681
FOR PROVIDERS TO DO SO. IT'LL

05:15:33.748 --> 05:15:35.082
ALSO IMPORT TO LOOK AT OTHER

05:15:35.149 --> 05:15:36.550
AREAS OF THIS BUT THE WILL

05:15:36.617 --> 05:15:38.019
AFFECT. CONSUMER SO DOES TO

IN SUPPORTIVE SERVICES AS A

05:15:43.791 --> 05:15:45.526
GENERIC RESOURCE THEY MUST

05:15:45.593 --> 05:15:47.561
EXHAUST THIS A GENERIC RESOURCE

05:15:47.628 --> 05:15:50.231
BEFORE ACCESSING SUPPORTED

05:15:50.298 --> 05:15:53.934
LIVING SERVICES. IF THE- IF THE

05:15:54.001 --> 05:15:55.269
LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE

05:15:55.336 --> 05:15:57.238
PROPOSED REDUCTION TO IN HOME

05:15:57.305 --> 05:15:59.707
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES HOURS THEN

05:15:59.774 --> 05:16:01.642
WE WILL LIKELY SEE AN INCREASE

05:16:01.709 --> 05:16:04.245
IN THE DDS BUDGET- AS THOSE

05:16:04.312 --> 05:16:06.514
CONSUMERS ACCESS MORE HOURS IN

05:16:06.580 --> 05:16:09.450
SUPPORTED. LIVING SERVICES AND

05:16:09.517 --> 05:16:11.619
TO OUR KNOWLEDGE THOSE- SORTS

05:16:11.686 --> 05:16:14.822
OF IMPACTS HAVE NOT YET BEEN

05:16:14.889 --> 05:16:15.356
ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE STATE

05:16:15.423 --> 05:16:16.057
BUDGET. OUR SECOND POINT IS

05:16:16.123 --> 05:16:19.327
THAT WE RECKON THE VILLAGES AND

05:16:19.393 --> 05:16:22.163
ADMINISTRATION- RECOMMENDED THE

05:16:22.229 --> 05:16:23.798
LEGISLATURE PRIORITIZE AND

05:16:23.864 --> 05:16:26.167
ENSURE CONTINUED SERVICES THAT

05:16:26.233 --> 05:16:27.234
ARE REALLY NEEDED DURING THE

05:16:27.301 --> 05:16:30.371
PUBLIC HEALTH RESPONSE SH- SO

05:16:30.438 --> 05:16:32.573
FOR EXAMPLE- IF IT WILL BE GOOD

05:16:32.640 --> 05:16:34.342
TO GET MORE CLARITY INTO THE

05:16:34.408 --> 05:16:35.843
TYPES OF SERVICES THAT ARE MOST

05:16:35.910 --> 05:16:37.545
IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN CONSUMER

05:16:37.611 --> 05:16:40.781
HEALTH AND SAFETY- AND TO KNOW

05:16:40.848 --> 05:16:42.383
WHAT ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITIES

05:16:42.450 --> 05:16:44.452
THAT MIGHT BE NEEDED. IN THAT

05:16:44.518 --> 05:16:48.389
RESPONSE AND JUST TO GIVE ONE

05:16:48.456 --> 05:16:50.391
EXAMPLE. EVEN IF IT COULD TAKE

05:16:50.458 --> 05:16:51.859
THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE UNIFORM

05:16:51.926 --> 05:16:54.028
HOLIDAY SCHEDULE AS AN EXAMPLE

05:16:54.095 --> 05:16:55.363
EVEN IF IT MAKES SENSE FROM A

05:16:55.429 --> 05:16:57.965
FISCAL PERSPECTIVE. TO ENFORCE

05:16:58.032 --> 05:16:59.433
THE UNIFORM HOLIDAY SCHEDULE

05:16:59.500 --> 05:17:00.701
IT'S UNCLEAR TO US THAT

05:17:00.768 --> 05:17:02.670
REQUIRING THOSE FOURTEEN DAYS

05:17:02.737 --> 05:17:03.904
TO BE THE SAME FOURTEEN DAYS

05:17:03.971 --> 05:17:07.007
ACROSS CONSUMERS AND ACROSS-

05:17:07.074 --> 05:17:09.944
SERVICES IN ACROSS THE STATE-

05:17:10.010 --> 05:17:11.445
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE FROM A

05:17:11.512 --> 05:17:12.680
PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE IT

05:17:12.747 --> 05:17:14.615
MIGHT WORK AT CROSS PURPOSES

05:17:14.682 --> 05:17:17.351
IF- IF PROVIDERS ARE TRYING TO

05:17:17.418 --> 05:17:18.719
STAY UNDER SERVICES ON

05:17:18.786 --> 05:17:20.454
DIFFERENT DAYS AND DIFFERENT

05:17:20.521 --> 05:17:21.655
HOURS AND THAT SORT OF THING.

05:17:21.722 --> 05:17:22.690
OKAY THE THIRD POINT I'D LIKE

05:17:22.757 --> 05:17:24.358
TO MEET IT'S ABOUT THE ROLE OF

05:17:24.425 --> 05:17:26.327
REGIONAL CENTERS HE- REVISED

05:17:26.394 --> 05:17:30.264
BUDGET PROPOSAL. BECAUSE A

05:17:30.331 --> 05:17:30.965
SINGLE TINA REDUCE FUNDING

05:17:31.031 --> 05:17:32.266
REGIONAL. WHILE INCREASING

05:17:32.333 --> 05:17:34.168
THEIR WORKLOAD SO FOR EXAMPLE

05:17:34.235 --> 05:17:35.236
REGIONAL CENTERS WILL BE

05:17:35.302 --> 05:17:36.570
REQUIRED TO CONDUCT A

05:17:36.637 --> 05:17:39.240
UTILIZATION REVIEW. DEVELOP AN

05:17:39.306 --> 05:17:42.109
EXPENDITURE PLAN- DIRECTOR

05:17:42.176 --> 05:17:43.244
MARGARINE JUST MENTIONED THAT

05:17:43.310 --> 05:17:44.945
THEY WOULD ALSO BE REQUIRED TO

05:17:45.012 --> 05:17:47.014
DEVELOP AN OPERATIONS PLAN. AND

05:17:47.081 --> 05:17:48.482
THEY WILL BE EXPECTED TO HELP

05:17:48.549 --> 05:17:50.451
FAMILIES ENROLL IN MEDICARE SO-

05:17:50.518 --> 05:17:51.619
IT SOUNDS LIKE THE PERFORMANCE

05:17:51.685 --> 05:17:53.220
CONTRACTS MAY BE REVISED

05:17:53.287 --> 05:17:55.356
SLIGHTLY- TO TARGET CONSUMER

05:17:55.423 --> 05:17:57.892
OUTCOMES- IN THERE WILL BE A

05:17:57.958 --> 05:17:59.627
TEN MINUTE- IT MINISTRATION

05:17:59.693 --> 05:18:01.462
ASSOCIATED WITH. ENFORCING THE

05:18:01.529 --> 05:18:03.330
FAMILY THE NEW FAMILY FEE

05:18:03.397 --> 05:18:07.601
STRUCTURE- SO THE DEPARTMENT

05:18:07.668 --> 05:18:08.702
HAS INCLUDED A COUPLE OF

05:18:08.769 --> 05:18:12.706
FLEXIBILITY IS TO- SORT OF-

05:18:12.773 --> 05:18:13.808
THAT. IS SOME OF THE WORKLOAD I

05:18:13.874 --> 05:18:15.443
GUESS YOU'D SAY OF THE REGIONAL

05:18:15.509 --> 05:18:17.411
CENTERS ONE IS TO REMOVE A

05:18:17.478 --> 05:18:19.280
CASELOAD. RATIO REQUIREMENT

05:18:19.346 --> 05:18:20.948
THAT'S CURRENTLY IN STATUTE FOR

05:18:21.015 --> 05:18:22.516
CONSUMERS WHO ARE NOT ENROLLED

05:18:22.583 --> 05:18:24.652
IN THE MEDICAID WAIVER. AND WHO

05:18:24.718 --> 05:18:26.120
ARE NOT REALLY START CONSUMERS

05:18:26.187 --> 05:18:28.255
ANOTHER IS TO- PROVIDE

05:18:28.322 --> 05:18:29.957
ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY WHEN IT

05:18:30.024 --> 05:18:31.192
COMES TO PROVIDING REMOTE

05:18:31.258 --> 05:18:33.761
SERVICE COORDINATION OR OR TELE

05:18:33.828 --> 05:18:35.663
SERVICE COORDINATION- WE DO

05:18:35.729 --> 05:18:38.065
HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE-

05:18:38.132 --> 05:18:40.000
PROPOSAL TO REMOVE THE CASELOAD

05:18:40.067 --> 05:18:44.004
RATIO REQUIREMENT. AND ALTHOUGH

05:18:44.071 --> 05:18:44.839
WE AGREE WITH THE DEPARTMENT

05:18:44.905 --> 05:18:46.941
THAT CASELOAD THIS IS WHAT IT

05:18:47.007 --> 05:18:49.810
IS THE ONLY WAY TO. ENSURE

05:18:49.877 --> 05:18:52.413
QUALITY OF SERVICE PROVISION

05:18:52.480 --> 05:18:53.514
THE DEPARTMENT MAINTAINS THAT

05:18:53.581 --> 05:18:55.683
REMOVING THIS RATIO WOULD ALLOW

05:18:55.749 --> 05:18:57.251
REGIONAL CENTERS TO APPROACH

05:18:57.318 --> 05:18:58.819
SERVICE COORDINATION MORE AND

05:18:58.886 --> 05:19:00.821
MORE INNOVATIVE FASHION. OUR

05:19:00.888 --> 05:19:03.023
CONCERN IS THAT WITH THIS-

05:19:03.090 --> 05:19:04.525
SIMULTANEOUS REDUCTION OF

05:19:04.592 --> 05:19:05.626
FUNDING THAT IT'LL SIMPLY

05:19:05.693 --> 05:19:16.804
RESULT IN HIGHER CASELOADS AND.

05:19:16.871 --> 05:19:18.639
NOT INNOVATIVE APPROACHES.

05:19:18.706 --> 05:19:20.641
FINALLY I JUST WANT TO MENTION

05:19:20.708 --> 05:19:22.409
THAT THE MAYOR OF. INCLUDE A

05:19:22.476 --> 05:19:24.545
LOT OF THE STORY TO THE- IN

05:19:24.612 --> 05:19:25.713
TERMS OF. THE ACT DETAILS ASSOC

05:19:25.779 --> 05:19:26.747
WITH FINDING THE EFFICIENT. IN

05:19:26.814 --> 05:19:30.384
THE BUDGET I. AS WELL AS IN THE

05:19:30.451 --> 05:19:31.252
OF G. THAT WILL BE MADE

05:19:31.318 --> 05:19:32.786
REGIONAL CENTER. TO ACHIEVE THE

05:19:32.853 --> 05:19:35.389
SAVINGS A LOT OF THOSE DETAILS

05:19:35.456 --> 05:19:38.092
ARE TO BE DETERMINED. SO WE

05:19:38.158 --> 05:19:39.627
HAVE JUST A COUPLE OF-

05:19:39.693 --> 05:19:42.563
RECOMMENDATIONS- ONE IS THAT IF

05:19:42.630 --> 05:19:44.031
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVES THE

05:19:44.098 --> 05:19:45.966
PAYMENT REDUCTIONS IN SOME OF

05:19:46.033 --> 05:19:46.934
THESE OTHER ACTIONS WE

05:19:47.001 --> 05:19:48.602
RECOMMEND THAT IT ADOPT BUDGET

05:19:48.669 --> 05:19:49.837
LANGUAGE TO REQUIRE THE

05:19:49.904 --> 05:19:52.840
DEPARTMENT. TO REPORT BY MAY OF

05:19:52.907 --> 05:19:54.575
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON HOW THOSE

05:19:54.642 --> 05:19:56.911
ACTIONS HAVE IMPACTED-

05:19:56.977 --> 05:20:02.683
CONSUMERS ACCESS TO SERVICES.

05:20:02.750 --> 05:20:03.684
AND IT SOUNDS. I GLAD TO HEAR

05:20:03.751 --> 05:20:06.053
THE JUST DIRECTOR BY MAY THIS

05:20:06.120 --> 05:20:07.054
THAT THEY BE WORKING WITH THE

05:20:07.121 --> 05:20:08.989
D. S. TASK. TO TRY TO

05:20:09.056 --> 05:20:11.091
UNDERSTAND THE EXPERIENCE OF

05:20:11.158 --> 05:20:12.426
FAMILIES AND CONSUMERS DURING

05:20:12.493 --> 05:20:13.794
THIS PERIOD SO THAT TYPE OF

05:20:13.861 --> 05:20:15.496
INFORMATION INCLUDING THE

05:20:15.563 --> 05:20:16.997
NUMBER OF DATA ON THE NUMBER OF

05:20:17.064 --> 05:20:18.299
CONSUMERS IN EACH CATEGORY

05:20:18.365 --> 05:20:19.366
WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL TO THE

05:20:19.433 --> 05:20:21.468
LEGISLATURE TO MAKE SURE. THAT

05:20:21.535 --> 05:20:23.804
CONSUMERS ARE STILL GETTING

05:20:23.871 --> 05:20:24.371
ACCESS TO THE SERVICES THAT

05:20:24.438 --> 05:20:26.774
THEY NEED- WE ALSO RECOMMEND

05:20:26.840 --> 05:20:27.775
SHOULD REQUIRING THE

05:20:27.841 --> 05:20:29.443
ADMINISTRATION TO NOTIFY THE

05:20:29.510 --> 05:20:31.579
LEGISLATURE- ONCE DDS IS MADE

05:20:31.645 --> 05:20:32.913
SOME OF THE KEY DECISIONS THAT

05:20:32.980 --> 05:20:34.315
ARE YET TO BE DETERMINED SUCH

05:20:34.381 --> 05:20:36.383
AS- HOW EFFICIENCIES WILL BE

05:20:36.450 --> 05:20:37.851
FOUND IN THE PURCHASE OF

05:20:37.918 --> 05:20:39.053
SERVICE BUDGET. AS WELL AS

05:20:39.119 --> 05:20:41.088
THEIR SPECIFIC- CHANGES THAT

05:20:41.155 --> 05:20:41.889
WILL BE MADE TO REGIONAL

05:20:41.956 --> 05:20:44.692
CENTRES OPERATING- BUDGETS

05:20:44.758 --> 05:20:46.794
MOVING FORWARD. AND THEN-

05:20:46.860 --> 05:20:48.028
FINALLY I WOULD JUST MENTION

05:20:48.095 --> 05:20:50.230
THAT WE DO RECOMMEND APPROVING

05:20:50.297 --> 05:20:51.966
THE PROPOSAL TO IN TRYING TO

05:20:52.032 --> 05:20:53.734
ENROLL MORE FAMILIES IN A

05:20:53.801 --> 05:20:55.603
MEDICAID WAIVER PROGRAM SAYS

05:20:55.669 --> 05:20:56.637
THAT WILL ALLOW THE STATE TO

05:20:56.704 --> 05:20:57.771
DRAW DOWN ADDITIONAL FEDERAL

05:20:57.838 --> 05:21:04.578
FUNDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

GENERAL. DEPARTMENT PROVIDE. A

05:21:28.335 --> 05:21:30.471
PLAN FOR CHEATING SAVINGS AND

CONSEQUENCES ASKS SO IT WANTED

05:21:48.288 --> 05:21:50.357
TO PARTNER PROVIDES A- AND

05:21:50.424 --> 05:21:52.526
BUDGET YEAR ALWAYS OPEN TO

05:21:52.593 --> 05:21:54.862
ENGAGE STAKE TO IDENTIFY IT OR

05:21:54.928 --> 05:21:57.164
IS ABOUT STRATEGY AND A FEW

05:21:57.231 --> 05:22:00.501
YEARS ON THE NEXT I WILL ITS

05:22:00.567 --> 05:22:10.911
THE DEPARTMENT DOES. SWITCHING

05:22:10.978 --> 05:22:13.714
THE SAVINGS AT THE END. YOU THE

05:22:13.781 --> 05:22:20.220
RESULTS ARE. WORK OR CONSUMER.

05:22:20.287 --> 05:22:21.422
AND THE LAST POINT I. UNDER

05:22:21.488 --> 05:22:24.258
THAT I ND DIFFICULT SEARCH OF

05:22:24.324 --> 05:22:25.526
TO REDUCE RESULTS OUR

05:22:25.592 --> 05:22:31.765
OPERATIONS THAT. POSIBLES WE TO

05:22:31.832 --> 05:22:33.801
INITIATE THAT PATIENTS THESE

05:22:33.867 --> 05:22:34.735
PERHAPS MAYBE NOT IN THE MEDIA

05:22:34.802 --> 05:22:36.103
SHORTS BUT IN THE LONG TERM

05:22:36.170 --> 05:22:38.639
SUCH. THE RESTRUCTURE OF THE

05:22:38.706 --> 05:22:45.713
COSHAM THAT. THE OUR MAN

05:22:45.779 --> 05:22:48.382
HEADQUARTERS WILL COLLECT SOME

05:22:48.449 --> 05:22:49.850
OF THOSE HE SO I DO THINK THAT

05:22:49.917 --> 05:22:51.552
THERE SOME EFFICIENCIES BE

05:22:51.618 --> 05:22:54.354
GAINED KNOWLEDGE OF THE YES

05:22:54.421 --> 05:23:00.394
WORK WITH X. REVIEWS YOUR.

THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU A

05:23:02.196 --> 05:23:03.831

ALL RIGHT SAY NO QUESTIONS FOR

05:23:05.866 --> 05:23:10.204
CREAM. EIGHT THE PRESIDENT. I

05:23:10.270 --> 05:23:13.040
GUESS. HELLO BUT I GUESS

05:23:13.107 --> 05:23:16.443
ANOTHER I KNOW OF WE HAVE A

05:23:16.510 --> 05:23:18.645
WEIRD WITH SOME BY ISSUE WE

05:23:18.712 --> 05:23:22.583
WERE FOR SOME I WOULD MAKE NOTE

05:23:22.649 --> 05:23:23.717
SOMEONE WITH A BACKGROUND

05:23:23.784 --> 05:23:25.252
QUALITY IMPROVEMENT IS THAT

05:23:25.319 --> 05:23:27.287
WELL CERTAINLY- REDUCTION IN

05:23:27.354 --> 05:23:29.490
RESOURCES MAY STIMULATE SOME

05:23:29.556 --> 05:23:31.825
CREATIVE THINKING OFTENTIMES

05:23:31.892 --> 05:23:33.694
CHANGE IN BEHAVIOR ACTUALLY

05:23:33.761 --> 05:23:34.194
REQUIRES INVESTMENT MORE

05:23:34.261 --> 05:23:36.497
RESOURCES. AND I THINK WE SEEN

05:23:36.563 --> 05:23:37.698
THIS ON REPEATED OCCASIONS

05:23:37.765 --> 05:23:39.466
WHERE SOMEONE SAID WELL IF WE

05:23:39.533 --> 05:23:40.634
ONLY DID THIS WE COULD ACTUALLY

05:23:40.701 --> 05:23:42.503
REDUCE BUT ACTUALLY WHAT THEY

05:23:42.569 --> 05:23:43.670
DID INVEST IN ACTUALLY MAKING

05:23:43.737 --> 05:23:45.506
THE BEHAVIOR CHANGE SO I JUST

05:23:45.572 --> 05:23:47.641
PUT THAT CAUTION OUT THERE

05:23:47.708 --> 05:23:49.910
THAT- CERTAINLY I THINK IT'S

05:23:49.977 --> 05:23:51.211
GOOD TO ENGAGE THE REGIONAL

05:23:51.278 --> 05:23:52.379
CENTERS AND THINKING MORE

05:23:52.446 --> 05:23:53.680
CREATIVELY ABOUT WAYS THEY CAN

05:23:53.747 --> 05:23:55.649
BE MORE EFFICIENT SIMPLY TAKING

05:23:55.716 --> 05:23:58.786
THE MONEY AWAY UP FRONT. MAY

05:23:58.852 --> 05:24:01.255
ACTUALLY DENIED THE RESOURCES

05:24:01.321 --> 05:24:06.560
NECESSARY TO MAKE THE KIND. OF

05:24:06.627 --> 05:24:07.694
CHANGES THAT THE- CENTER MAY

05:24:07.761 --> 05:24:11.565
MAKE THAT LEAD TO SAY AS A SO

05:24:11.632 --> 05:24:13.033
THERE MAY BE THOUGHT OF. HAVING

05:24:13.100 --> 05:24:14.668
SOME TO BE A TO MAKE AN- WHEN

05:24:14.735 --> 05:24:16.970
THERE'S A CLEAR DIRECTION AS TO

05:24:17.037 --> 05:24:18.806
WHAT MAY BE. A CHANGE THAT

05:24:18.872 --> 05:24:20.073
COULD LEAD TO A GREATER

05:24:20.140 --> 05:24:21.008
EFFICIENCIES IN THE FUTURE

05:24:21.074 --> 05:24:23.443
CERTAINLY SOMETHING WEWANT TO

05:24:23.510 --> 05:24:26.079
TRY TO PUSH FOR- I SEE THE-

05:24:26.146 --> 05:24:28.882
TERMS OF. THE PARTS OR SERVICES

05:24:28.949 --> 05:24:30.350
YET DELEO HAD SUGGESTED FOR

05:24:30.417 --> 05:24:32.252
EXAMPLE I MEAN WE ARE TRYING TO

05:24:32.319 --> 05:24:32.753
DEAL WITH SOME BUDGETARY

05:24:32.820 --> 05:24:37.224
ISSUES- THE- FOR EXAMPLE THAT

05:24:37.291 --> 05:24:39.793
ANY WEEDS. NOT NOT A BIG FAN OF

05:24:39.860 --> 05:24:42.196

OF SAMPLE FOR. WE IT MADE IT

05:24:50.304 --> 05:24:51.972
MADE BE HIGHER TO BUILD

05:24:52.039 --> 05:24:54.107
IMPLEMENTED FEES IT HAD TO BE.

05:24:54.174 --> 05:24:55.542
FOURTEENTH DAYS AND PEOPLE ARE

DISTANCING OUR- PHYSICAL

05:24:58.812 --> 05:25:00.380
DISTANCING OR SOME OTHER.

05:25:00.447 --> 05:25:02.449
SCHEDULED ARRANGEMENT TO TRY TO

05:25:02.516 --> 05:25:04.952
MINIMIZE- EITHER EXPOSURE OR

05:25:05.018 --> 05:25:07.020
TREATING THAT FLEXIBILITY. SO

05:25:07.087 --> 05:25:10.557
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

05:25:10.624 --> 05:25:23.170
DEPARTMENTS OPEN TO. HELLO.

THAT HAS BEEN A PROCESS THAT

05:25:42.923 --> 05:25:45.492
WAS USED IN THE PAST AND UNDER

05:25:45.559 --> 05:25:47.661
CURRENT CONDITIONS- WE'RE STILL

05:25:47.728 --> 05:25:51.131
SEEING IT AS A COST SAVING

05:25:51.198 --> 05:25:53.300
MEASURE THAT WE CAN IMPLEMENT-

05:25:53.367 --> 05:25:54.735
WE'RE GOING TO BE CONTINUING

05:25:54.801 --> 05:25:55.636

PROPOSING AS A DIFFERENCE THAN

05:26:03.610 --> 05:26:05.245
WE HAD IN THE PRIOR

05:26:05.312 --> 05:26:07.314
IMPLEMENTATION- WAS WITH

AND THIS WAS- BASED ON

05:26:17.090 --> 05:26:18.959
STAKEHOLDER INPUT OVER THE LAST

05:26:19.026 --> 05:26:20.460
SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT THOSE WHO

INTO THE APPROACH THIS TIME-

05:26:32.339 --> 05:26:33.240
SOME OF THE COST SAVING

05:26:33.307 --> 05:26:35.042
MEASURES HAS TO DO WITH THE

05:26:35.108 --> 05:26:35.575
FACT THAT THINGS ARE IN

05:26:35.642 --> 05:26:37.878
ALIGNMENT AND THAT'S WHERE SOME

05:26:37.945 --> 05:26:38.812
OF THE ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE SO

05:26:38.879 --> 05:26:40.781
IF YOU HAVE INDIVIDUALS THAT

05:26:40.847 --> 05:26:42.916
ARE ATTENDING A PROGRAM AND

05:26:42.983 --> 05:26:44.418
THEN THERE'S RELATED COSTS

05:26:44.484 --> 05:26:47.054
THAT- COME ALONG WITH THAT- BUT

05:26:47.120 --> 05:26:50.991
WE DO- HERE AND ARE OPEN TO

05:26:51.058 --> 05:26:52.292
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW IT IS-

05:26:52.359 --> 05:26:53.327
EVERYTHING ALIGNED WITH.

05:26:53.393 --> 05:27:00.567
CONSIDERATION OUR APPROACH TO-

05:27:00.634 --> 05:27:01.735
RESPONSE TO KOBE. OKAY WELL

05:27:01.802 --> 05:27:03.370
ANYTHING A TO SHOW. AS WELL

05:27:03.437 --> 05:27:05.405
LINE MAKES SOME SAY PUBLIC MAY

05:27:05.472 --> 05:27:06.073
DEMAND THAT THAT WOULD BE

05:27:06.139 --> 05:27:07.574
DANGEROUS SO. AND BY THE THAT

05:27:07.641 --> 05:27:09.576
MY REFLECT ON THE FACT THAT

05:27:09.643 --> 05:27:11.545
THAT MAY BE DRIVING COSTS UP

05:27:11.611 --> 05:27:15.248
EVEN YOU KNOW. THIS RIGHT NOW

05:27:15.315 --> 05:27:16.550
BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN. MYSTERY

SCHEDULE YOU KNOW IS IN SOME

05:27:26.293 --> 05:27:27.694
WAYS AS I THINK THE ADVOCATES

05:27:27.761 --> 05:27:29.162
WOULD POINT OUT IS A SORT OF A

05:27:29.229 --> 05:27:31.465
FURLOUGH OF SORTS BECAUSE THE

05:27:31.531 --> 05:27:33.033
NEED FOR THE SERVICES DON'T.

05:27:33.100 --> 05:27:34.201

RECENTLY THE PORTERVILLE

05:41:00.339 --> 05:41:01.707
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER WAS USED

05:41:01.774 --> 05:41:03.309
AS A SEARCH SITES I WAS JUST

05:41:03.376 --> 05:41:05.011
WONDERING IF. ANY OF THOSE BEDS

05:41:05.077 --> 05:41:09.682
THAT THAT WERE USED IF THEY'RE-

05:41:09.749 --> 05:41:11.417
GOING TO BE USED AS PART OF

05:41:11.484 --> 05:41:14.587
THE- YOU KNOW. THE TRANSITION

05:41:14.654 --> 05:41:17.990
THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR. THANK

05:41:18.057 --> 05:41:20.593
YOU SENATOR D'AMATO- B. THERE'S

05:41:20.660 --> 05:41:21.794
TWO SIDES TO PORTABLE

05:41:21.861 --> 05:41:22.995
DEVELOPMENTAL CENTER THERE'S A

05:41:23.062 --> 05:41:24.664
SECURE TREATMENT SIDE WHICH-

05:41:24.730 --> 05:41:26.532
WHEN WE REFER BEHIND THE FENCE

05:41:26.599 --> 05:41:28.668
THAT REALLY IS LITERALLY BEHIND

05:41:28.734 --> 05:41:29.435
A FENCE SO THAT SAID SECURITY

05:41:29.502 --> 05:41:33.105
AREA- THAT IS- UNPROTECTED- AND

05:41:33.172 --> 05:41:35.107
THEN THERE'S WHAT WE HAD JUST

05:41:35.174 --> 05:41:36.576
MOVED EVERYBODY FROM THE

05:41:36.642 --> 05:41:37.844
AIRPORT TO BUILD GENERAL

05:41:37.910 --> 05:41:39.345
TREATMENT AREA WHICH IS.

05:41:39.412 --> 05:41:41.113
OUTSIDE THAT IS NOT A SECURED

05:41:41.180 --> 05:41:43.182
OR LOCKED SETTING AND SO ON

05:41:43.249 --> 05:41:45.218
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS WE

05:41:45.284 --> 05:41:47.053
HAD JUST OVER TWO HUNDRED

05:41:47.119 --> 05:41:47.620
INDIVIDUALS IN THE GENERAL

05:41:47.687 --> 05:41:49.488
TREATMENT AREA OVER AT PORTER

05:41:49.555 --> 05:41:50.723
BILL THAT WE HAD MOVED TO THE

05:41:50.790 --> 05:41:52.758
COMMUNITY AND AS YOU CORRECTLY

05:41:52.825 --> 05:41:54.560
NOTED THAT WE HAD DEVELOPED FOR

05:41:54.627 --> 05:41:56.429
SURGE CAPACITY OVER A PORTABLE

05:41:56.495 --> 05:41:58.364
IN THAT GENERAL TREATMENT AREAS

05:41:58.431 --> 05:42:00.132
SO IT WASN'T BEHIND THE FENCE.

05:42:00.199 --> 05:42:02.468
SO IT WASN'T A SECURED AREA SO

05:42:02.535 --> 05:42:06.138
THE RESOURCES THAT ARE IN AND

05:42:06.205 --> 05:42:07.673
THAT GENERAL TREATMENT AREA

05:42:07.740 --> 05:42:08.941
WOULD NOT BE APPROPRIATE FOR

05:42:09.008 --> 05:42:10.209
THE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD THEN

05:42:10.276 --> 05:42:12.078
BE MOVING ON TO A SECURE

05:42:12.144 --> 05:42:14.647
TREATMENT SETTING- TO DETERMINE

05:42:14.714 --> 05:42:16.883
COMPETENCY SO USING THAT-

05:42:16.949 --> 05:42:19.218
RESOURCES OUTSIDE WOULD NOT BE

05:42:19.285 --> 05:42:20.720
AVAILABLE BUT WE DO HAVE

05:42:20.786 --> 05:42:22.688
EXISTING UNITS BEHIND THE FENCE

05:42:22.755 --> 05:42:25.124
THAT WE WOULD BE ABLE TO- GO

05:42:25.191 --> 05:42:30.830
AHEAD AND DEVELOP WITH THE USE.

05:42:30.897 --> 05:42:31.364

IMPACT OF WITHDRAWING BEING.

05:43:42.435 --> 05:43:44.303
PROPOSED FUNDING SERVE FOR

05:43:44.370 --> 05:43:45.137
TWENTY TWENTY ONE. M. AND

05:43:45.204 --> 05:43:47.340
THAT'S BASICALLY- NINETEEN

05:43:47.406 --> 05:43:48.541
MILLION DOLLARS SON GENERAL

05:43:48.607 --> 05:43:50.710
FUND THAT THE THAT THE COUNTIES

05:43:50.776 --> 05:43:51.577
WERE EXPECTING TO GET THIS

05:43:51.644 --> 05:43:54.213
YEAR- AS WELL AS THE NINETEEN

05:43:54.280 --> 05:43:54.814
MILLION DOLLARS THAT THEY GOT

05:43:54.880 --> 05:43:58.451
LAST YEAR. NOW WITH THE FEDERAL

05:43:58.517 --> 05:43:59.051
MATCH THAT'S FIFTY SIX MILLION

05:43:59.118 --> 05:44:00.219
DOLLARS. ORIGINALLY THIS MONEY

05:44:00.286 --> 05:44:03.122
WAS TARGETED TO- BRING THE

05:44:03.189 --> 05:44:04.623
LOWEST FUNDED TWENTY ONE

05:44:04.690 --> 05:44:05.191
COUNTIES UP TO THE FUNDING

05:44:05.257 --> 05:44:07.059
METHODOLOGY. WITH THIS

05:44:07.126 --> 05:44:08.060
REDUCTION WE DIDN'T WANT TO

05:44:08.127 --> 05:44:09.729
GIVE IMMEDIATELY GO RIGHT BACK

05:44:09.795 --> 05:44:10.696
TO THE UNDERFUNDED COUNTIES AND

05:44:10.763 --> 05:44:12.298
PULL THAT AWAY SO FROM THE

05:44:12.365 --> 05:44:13.599
METHODOLOGY PERSPECTIVE WE'RE

05:44:13.666 --> 05:44:14.700
TAKING TWENTY FOUR MILLION

05:44:14.767 --> 05:44:15.935
DOLLARS FROM THOSE COUNTIES

05:44:16.002 --> 05:44:17.103
THAT WERE OVER THE FUNDING

05:44:17.169 --> 05:44:19.105
METHODOLOGY. AND THE BALANCE ON

05:44:19.171 --> 05:44:20.172
ABOUT THIRTY TWO MILLION

05:44:20.239 --> 05:44:23.242
DOLLARS FOR THEM TO FIND IT. WE

05:44:23.309 --> 05:44:25.144
THOUGHT THAT WAS A REASONABLE

05:44:25.211 --> 05:44:26.345
EXPECTATION OF THE OVER FUNDING

05:44:26.412 --> 05:44:28.381
COUNTIES WITHOUT OVERLY.

05:44:28.447 --> 05:44:30.649
BURDENING THEM. UNFORTUNATELY

05:44:30.716 --> 05:44:31.784
HAVE THE SMALLER PORTION OF

05:44:31.851 --> 05:44:33.719
THIS OVERALL STATE BUDGET. ONLY

05:44:33.786 --> 05:44:36.422
ABOUT TWENTY FIVE. PERCENT OF

05:44:36.489 --> 05:44:37.556
THE LOCAL TRANSPORT FUNDING SO

05:44:37.623 --> 05:44:40.860
WE CAN FULLY. EXPLORE THEM TO

05:44:40.926 --> 05:44:42.328
COVER THE FULL AMOUNT SO THAT'S

05:44:42.395 --> 05:44:44.163
THE EXPLANATION BETWEEN HOW

05:44:44.230 --> 05:44:46.465
WE'RE BREAKING DOWN. AND RICK

05:44:46.532 --> 05:44:47.700
PULLING OUT FIFTY SX MILLION

05:44:47.767 --> 05:44:49.335
DOLLARS BACK THE SECOND

05:44:49.402 --> 05:44:50.136
QUESTION IS ABOUT THE REPORT

05:44:50.202 --> 05:44:52.538
THE LEGISLATION EFFICIENCIES

05:44:52.605 --> 05:44:53.439
THAT WERE IMPLEMENTING. THERE'S

05:44:53.506 --> 05:44:54.707
SEVERAL INITIATIVES THAT WE

05:44:54.774 --> 05:44:56.075
HAVE GOING ON RIGHT NOW- THAT

05:44:56.142 --> 05:44:58.044
WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO MOVE

05:44:58.110 --> 05:44:59.512
FORWARD THE LARGEST THOSE IS

05:44:59.578 --> 05:45:01.514
THE MIGRATION TO THE CLOUD- OFF

05:45:01.580 --> 05:45:02.915
OF OUR LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HERE

05:45:02.982 --> 05:45:04.850
WHICH WE EXPECT AND HOPE WILL-

05:45:04.917 --> 05:45:05.818
SEE THE SAVINGS THAT WE'RE

05:45:05.885 --> 05:45:07.420
LOOKING FOR. I'M CERTAINLY

05:45:07.486 --> 05:45:08.421
WORKING WITH THE COURTS AND

05:45:08.487 --> 05:45:09.855
THROUGH OUR ELECTRONIC PROCESS

05:45:09.922 --> 05:45:11.390
WE'RE TRYING TO SYSTEMATICALLY

05:45:11.457 --> 05:45:13.426
CHANGEOVER FORMS TOWARDS THE

05:45:13.492 --> 05:45:15.094
SIGNING AND GETTING ELECTRONIC

05:45:15.161 --> 05:45:16.896
DELIVERY OF DOCUMENTS BACK AND

05:45:16.962 --> 05:45:19.231
FORTH TO MINIMIZE- MALAN. AND

05:45:19.298 --> 05:45:22.001
SPEED UP THE DISTRIBUTION AND

05:45:22.068 --> 05:45:22.902
RETURN DOCUMENTS. WE

05:45:22.968 --> 05:45:24.770
IMPLEMENTED TEXT MESSAGING IN

05:45:24.837 --> 05:45:27.173
JANUARY WHICH WAS TO IMPROVE

05:45:27.239 --> 05:45:28.741
THE COMMUNICATION BETWEEN US

05:45:28.808 --> 05:45:30.976
AND OUR CONSTITUENTS- AND WE

05:45:31.043 --> 05:45:32.078
HAVE A FEW SMALLER ITEMS THAT

05:45:32.144 --> 05:45:33.512
ARE GOING FORWARD AS WELL.

05:45:33.579 --> 05:45:34.713
THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE RIGHT NOW

05:45:34.780 --> 05:45:36.682
AND YOUR QUESTIONS. AND ANSWER

05:45:36.749 --> 05:45:37.249
ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YOU MAY

05:45:37.316 --> 05:45:38.918
HAVE. ALL RIGHT WELL THANK YOU

05:45:38.984 --> 05:45:44.356
VERY MUCH. FIRST A COMMENT FROM

05:45:44.423 --> 05:45:46.559
LMAO. I THANK YOU VERY YOU

05:45:46.625 --> 05:45:48.394
AGAIN WITH LUNCH PANELISTS

05:45:48.461 --> 05:45:51.764
OFFICE WAS IN. WHILE THE- IS TO.

05:45:51.831 --> 05:45:53.933
LOCAL TRANSPORTED FUNDING BY

05:45:53.999 --> 05:45:55.034
THIRTY EIGHT MILLION IN THE

05:45:55.101 --> 05:45:56.735
BUDGET YEAR THAT REALLY JUST

05:45:56.802 --> 05:45:57.970
TRANSLATES TO A NINETEEN

05:45:58.037 --> 05:45:59.572
MILLION DOLLAR REDUCTION IN

05:45:59.638 --> 05:46:00.706
THEIR CURRENT BASE FUNDING

05:46:00.773 --> 05:46:02.641
LEVELS AND THE REASON THAT IS

05:46:02.708 --> 05:46:04.009
BECAUSE- IT'S THIRTY EIGHT

05:46:04.076 --> 05:46:05.978
MILLION DOLLARS CONSISTS. OF

05:46:06.045 --> 05:46:07.980
TWO DISTINCT COMPONENTS ONE

05:46:08.047 --> 05:46:09.448
BEING A WITHDRAWAL OF THE

05:46:09.515 --> 05:46:11.617
PROPOSED FUNDING INCREASE MADE

05:46:11.684 --> 05:46:13.752
IN JANUARY WHICH SINCE IT

05:46:13.819 --> 05:46:14.854
HASN'T GONE OUT YET IT WAS A

05:46:14.920 --> 05:46:16.455
PROPOSAL DOESN'T ACTUALLY.

05:46:16.522 --> 05:46:17.723
AFFECT CURRENT BASE FUNDING

05:46:17.790 --> 05:46:20.326
LEVELS. THUS THE REMAINING HALF

05:46:20.392 --> 05:46:21.227
OF THE THIRTY EIGHT MILLION

05:46:21.293 --> 05:46:24.163
DOLLAR PROPOSAL IS TRULY A BASE

05:46:24.230 --> 05:46:25.264
FUNDING REDUCTION BECAUSE IT'S

05:46:25.331 --> 05:46:27.233
NOT IT'S AN ELIMINATION. OF

05:46:27.299 --> 05:46:29.602
NINETEEN MILLION. OF A NINETY

05:46:29.668 --> 05:46:30.236
MILLION DOLLAR FUNDING

05:46:30.302 --> 05:46:31.637
AUGMENTATION THAT WAS PROVIDED

05:46:31.704 --> 05:46:36.208
LAST YEAR AS A PART. OF THE

05:46:36.275 --> 05:46:36.842
TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY BY JACK.

05:46:36.909 --> 05:46:37.409
GIVEN THE DIFFERENT END OF

05:46:37.476 --> 05:46:38.577
THESE TWO COME. ON THE LEDGE

05:46:38.644 --> 05:46:40.946
MAY WANT TO APPROACH BOTH OF

05:46:41.013 --> 05:46:43.349
THEM DIFFERENTLY IN THE CASE OF

05:46:43.415 --> 05:46:45.117
THE BASE FUNDING REDUCTION AS

05:46:45.184 --> 05:46:47.186
THE DEPARTMENT DESCRIBED. THEIR

05:46:47.253 --> 05:46:49.155
APPROACH IS TO MINIMIZE THE

05:46:49.221 --> 05:46:50.789
REDUCTIONS WITHIN THOSE LOCAL

05:46:50.856 --> 05:46:52.158
CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT

05:46:52.224 --> 05:46:53.159
WERE IDENTIFIED TO BE

05:46:53.225 --> 05:46:54.793
UNDERFUNDED PER THEIR NEW

05:46:54.860 --> 05:46:56.195
BUDGETING METHODOLOGY AND WHAT

05:46:56.262 --> 05:46:58.197
THAT I ESSENTIALLY TRANSLATES

05:46:58.264 --> 05:46:59.999
TO IS. YOU WOULD SEE LOCAL

05:47:00.065 --> 05:47:01.400
CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES THAT

05:47:01.467 --> 05:47:02.535
WERE IDENTIFIED TO BE

05:47:02.601 --> 05:47:04.670
OVERFUNDED OR TO HAVE ACCESS

05:47:04.737 --> 05:47:06.438
FUNDS ABOVE THEIR CALCULATED

05:47:06.505 --> 05:47:08.040
FUNDING NEED YOU WOULD SEE A

05:47:08.107 --> 05:47:09.375
GREATER REDUCTION IN THEIR

05:47:09.441 --> 05:47:12.278
BUDGETS- RELATIVE TO THE

05:47:12.344 --> 05:47:13.979
UNDERFUNDED LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT

05:47:14.046 --> 05:47:16.482
AGENCIES. IF THIS WERE DONE IF

05:47:16.549 --> 05:47:17.283
THE REDUCTION OF THE BASE

05:47:17.349 --> 05:47:19.218
FUNDING WERE TO GO THROUGH WE

05:47:19.285 --> 05:47:20.553
GENERALLY AGREE WITH THIS

05:47:20.619 --> 05:47:22.988
APPROACH- IN THAT IT BOASTS

05:47:23.055 --> 05:47:27.326
TRIES TO REDUCE THE- THE

05:47:27.393 --> 05:47:28.994
FUNDING GAPS WITHIN THE

05:47:29.061 --> 05:47:31.030
UNDERFUNDED. LCS STAYS FOR THE

05:47:31.096 --> 05:47:32.164
ADMINISTRATION'S BUDGETING

05:47:32.231 --> 05:47:34.033
METHODOLOGY BUT IT ALSO MAKES

05:47:55.054 --> 05:47:56.956
WANT TO ASK THE ADMINISTRATION.

ARE STILL IN PLACE THOUGH THEY

05:50:31.677 --> 05:50:33.345
ARE BEING AFFECTED BY. THE LOSS

05:50:33.412 --> 05:50:34.880

05:50:39.084 --> 05:50:41.019
DECLINE IN TOTAL OVERALL

05:50:41.086 --> 05:50:41.587

05:50:43.956 --> 05:50:45.190
DECLINE IN COLLECTIONS OVER THE

05:50:45.257 --> 05:50:47.760
SCORE COURSE OF THIS YEAR. OKAY

05:50:47.826 --> 05:50:50.496
WELL I GUESS MY CONCERN. IS

05:50:50.562 --> 05:50:51.930
THAT NOT ONLY OF COURSE WITH

05:50:51.997 --> 05:50:54.133
MISSING AT THE FEDERAL MATCH

05:50:54.199 --> 05:50:56.468

05:50:56.535 --> 05:50:57.569
FROM PEOPLE WHO ACTUALLY ARE

05:50:57.636 --> 05:50:59.037
GOING TO GET. HOPEFULLY MORE

05:50:59.104 --> 05:50:59.538
MONEY INTO THE HANDS OF

05:50:59.605 --> 05:51:01.907

05:51:18.957 --> 05:51:20.859
EXAMINE THAT VERY CAREFULLY.

05:51:20.926 --> 05:51:22.694
BECAUSE ULTIMATELY AND WE'LL BE

05:51:22.761 --> 05:51:24.029
TALKING LATER ON ABOUT CAL

05:51:24.096 --> 05:51:25.230
WORKS AND OTHER TYPES OF

05:51:25.297 --> 05:51:28.000
PROGRAMS WHAT STATE PROVIDES

05:51:28.066 --> 05:51:29.101
DIRECT ASSISTANCE TO. FAMILIES

05:51:29.168 --> 05:51:30.369
BUT THIS IS ALSO ANOTHER MEANS

05:51:30.436 --> 05:51:32.871
BY WHICH WE PROVIDE. ASSISTANCE

05:51:32.938 --> 05:51:34.973
TO OUR FAMILIES AND- THAT WOULD

05:51:35.040 --> 05:51:36.642
BE SURE THAT- YOU KNOW WE

05:51:36.708 --> 05:51:38.310
UNDERSTAND THE TRUE COST OF

05:51:38.377 --> 05:51:40.946
WHAT WERE. ACTUALLY DOING HERE

05:51:41.013 --> 05:51:42.581
SO. YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

05:51:42.648 --> 05:51:44.216
NINETEEN MILLION GENERAL FUND

05:51:44.283 --> 05:51:45.184
FIFTY SIX MILLION TOTAL FUND

05:51:45.250 --> 05:51:46.485
EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY DOES

05:51:46.552 --> 05:51:48.320
THAT FINALLY TRANSLATE INTO

05:51:48.387 --> 05:51:49.855
TERMS OF LOSS OF FUNDS TO

05:51:49.922 --> 05:51:51.557
FAMILIES WHO NEED TO NEED THESE

05:51:51.623 --> 05:51:53.425
FUNDS. THAT HELD IT

05:51:53.492 --> 05:51:55.327
PARTICULARLY CHILDREN SO I JUST

05:51:55.394 --> 05:51:56.328
WANNA BE SURE THAT WE'RE

05:51:56.395 --> 05:51:58.630
LOOKING AT THIS VERY CAREFULLY-

05:51:58.697 --> 05:52:00.532
IN TERMS OF EXACTLY WHAT IS THE

05:52:00.599 --> 05:52:01.900
END RESULTS OF THESE

05:52:01.967 --> 05:52:05.604
REDUCTIONS. AND THEIR ULTIMATE

05:52:05.671 --> 05:52:10.342
IMPACT. ALL RIGHT SO HOPEFULLY

WE CAN GET SOME DATA OR

05:52:12.044 --> 05:52:13.846
INFORMATION ABOUT THAT AS WE

05:52:13.912 --> 05:52:15.948
MOVE FORWARD AND MAKING OUR

05:52:16.014 --> 05:52:17.015
FUTURE BUDGETARY DECISIONS.

05:52:17.082 --> 05:52:20.352
OKAY ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- IT'S

05:52:20.419 --> 05:52:23.255
ACTUALLY IS THERE ANY. FINAL

05:52:23.322 --> 05:52:26.091
COMMENT FROM AGENCY ABOUT ABOUT

05:52:26.158 --> 05:52:27.860
THAT I MEAN IS THERE A WAY TO

05:52:27.926 --> 05:52:28.360
TRY TO GET THAT KIND OF

05:52:28.427 --> 05:52:31.029
INFORMATION. SO THE DECLINE IN

05:52:31.096 --> 05:52:32.130
FIFTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS

05:52:32.197 --> 05:52:33.499
FEDERAL AND STATE MONEY AT AND

05:52:33.565 --> 05:52:35.367
DROP THIS TO R. EIGHTEEN

05:52:35.434 --> 05:52:36.568
NINETEEN BUDGET WHICH IS WHAT

05:52:36.635 --> 05:52:38.070
WE WERE WORKING ON FOR ALMOST

05:52:38.136 --> 05:52:39.204
FIFTEEN YEARS UP TO THAT POINT

05:52:39.271 --> 05:52:40.873
SO WE'RE PRETTY FAMILIAR WITH

05:52:40.939 --> 05:52:43.075
THAT PROCESS AND THE AMOUNT OF

05:52:43.141 --> 05:52:44.343
SOME SUPPORT THAT I CAN PROVIDE

05:52:44.409 --> 05:52:45.844
THE CONSTITUENTS. THE VERY

05:52:45.911 --> 05:52:47.212
LOWEST FUNDED COUNTIES ARE

05:52:47.279 --> 05:52:48.213
ACTUALLY GOING TO BE A LITTLE

05:52:48.280 --> 05:52:49.214
BIT BETTER THAN THEY WERE

05:52:49.281 --> 05:52:51.116
DURING THOSE YEARS THAT DECADE

05:52:51.183 --> 05:52:53.685
OF FLAT FUNDING AND THE HIGHEST

05:52:53.752 --> 05:52:55.153
FUNDED COUNTIES ARE GOING TO BE

05:52:55.220 --> 05:52:55.988
COMING DOWN SO THEY'LL HAVE TO

05:52:56.054 --> 05:52:57.256
MAKE ADJUSTMENTS AND CERTAINLY

05:52:57.322 --> 05:52:58.824
NOT THE BEST SITUATION OR JUST

05:52:58.891 --> 05:52:59.725
SITUATION WE WANTED TO BE AN

05:52:59.791 --> 05:53:01.760
BUT- WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE.

05:53:01.827 --> 05:53:03.128
ADJUSTMENTS AND MEET THE NEEDS

05:53:03.195 --> 05:53:04.062
OF THE COUNTIES AS MUCH AS

05:53:04.129 --> 05:53:06.298
POSSIBLE. OKAY AND I KNOW THAT

05:53:06.365 --> 05:53:07.833
AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE-

05:53:07.900 --> 05:53:09.334
CHILD SUPPORT THE COUNTIES CAME

05:53:09.401 --> 05:53:10.369
TOGETHER TO COME UP THE NEW

05:53:10.435 --> 05:53:11.470
METHODOLOGY THAT'S MORE

05:53:11.537 --> 05:53:13.205
RATIONAL- AND I WAS VERY

05:53:13.272 --> 05:53:15.374
SUPPORTIVE OF THAT- AND I'M

05:53:15.440 --> 05:53:16.208
GLAD TO KNOW THAT THE

05:53:16.275 --> 05:53:17.209
ADMINISTRATION IS TRYING TO

05:53:17.276 --> 05:53:19.244
PRESERVE THAT AS WELL. BUT

05:53:19.311 --> 05:53:22.080
AGAIN- I JUST KNOW THAT BACK

05:53:22.147 --> 05:53:23.248
THEN BEFORE WE DID THE

05:53:23.315 --> 05:53:25.651
AUGMENTATION WE STILL HAD

05:53:25.717 --> 05:53:27.619
OPPORTUNITIES TO COLLECT MORE

05:53:27.686 --> 05:53:30.055
MONEY AND GET IT PLEASE. AND SO

05:53:30.122 --> 05:53:32.024
WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT THAT IN

05:53:32.090 --> 05:53:34.893
TERMS OF THINKING IT. MONEY

05:53:34.960 --> 05:53:37.863
SMART. AND I SPEND A CUTS AND

05:53:37.930 --> 05:53:39.831
REGARD SINCE WE'RE ALSO IS

BE A TRY TO MAKE A. BETTER TO.

05:53:53.612 --> 05:53:55.714
OF THAT MEANS TO CLASS OF FUN

05:53:55.781 --> 05:53:59.117
STUFF. CELL I APPRECIATE THAT

05:53:59.184 --> 05:53:59.685
WE DIDN'T KNOW WE WERE DOING

05:53:59.751 --> 05:54:00.519
THINGS BEFORE BUT I THINK A

05:54:00.586 --> 05:54:02.387
EVEN BACK THEN THAT'S ACTIVE

05:54:02.454 --> 05:54:03.388
THE SETTLED WAS GO AFTER A FOR

05:54:03.455 --> 05:54:04.623
NOT BECAUSE AS MUCH MONEY AS

05:54:04.690 --> 05:54:06.425

SEE THEM PUT IN MORE PERIL THAN

06:03:59.484 --> 06:04:00.885
IS NECESSARY AND HAS THAT BEEN

06:04:00.952 --> 06:04:02.353
CONTEMPLATED GIVEN THE FACT

06:04:02.420 --> 06:04:03.454

JENNIFER TRY YEAH- WITH THE

06:04:23.608 --> 06:04:24.375
DEPARTMENT AND CHIEF DEPUTY

06:04:24.442 --> 06:04:26.444
DIRECTOR- I JUST WANTED TO

06:04:26.511 --> 06:04:27.712
COMMENT THAT THE LEVEL OF CARE

06:04:27.779 --> 06:04:29.714
RATES- ARE A PART OF THE-

06:04:29.781 --> 06:04:31.049
CONTINUUM OF CARE REFORM

06:04:31.115 --> 06:04:33.284
INITIATIVES. AT THEY WERE IN

06:04:33.351 --> 06:04:35.753
INCREASED BETTER RATE OVER WHAT

06:04:35.820 --> 06:04:38.022
EXISTED PRIOR TO C. C. R. FOR

06:04:38.089 --> 06:04:40.425
ALL FAMILIES SO THE BASIC LEVEL

06:04:40.491 --> 06:04:43.127
OF CARE RATE AND THAT IS. NOT

06:04:43.194 --> 06:04:44.796
BEING CHANGED BY THIS PROPOSAL

06:04:44.862 --> 06:04:46.664
IS ALREADY AN INCREASED RATE

06:04:46.731 --> 06:04:48.866
FROM WHERE WE WERE A FEW YEARS

06:04:48.933 --> 06:04:51.903
AGO- AND HOPEFULLY IT'S HELPFUL

06:04:51.970 --> 06:04:53.471
FOR THOSE PURPOSES AT THE SAME

06:04:53.538 --> 06:04:55.807
TIME I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THE

06:04:55.873 --> 06:04:57.775
OTHER ADDITIONAL LEVEL OF KERR

06:04:57.842 --> 06:05:00.011
READ WERE INTENDED TO- TO

06:05:00.078 --> 06:05:01.412
DISTINGUISH AMONG FAMILIES

06:05:01.479 --> 06:05:02.513
WITHIN THAT AND THAT THAT

06:05:02.580 --> 06:05:03.915
CONVERSATION CAN. YOU WORK WITH

06:05:03.982 --> 06:05:05.984
TIME BUT RIGHT NOW IT WOULD NOT

06:05:06.050 --> 06:05:09.220
BE USING A HIGHER LEVEL OF CARE

06:05:09.287 --> 06:05:12.190
GREAT AND- IT DISTINGUISH BUT

06:05:12.257 --> 06:05:13.224
ALL FAMILIES HAVE RECEIVED AN

06:05:13.291 --> 06:05:19.597
INCREASE. BASED ON CPR. I THINK

06:05:19.664 --> 06:05:21.933
YOU I GUESS WHAT I'M GETTING

06:05:22.000 --> 06:05:22.667
THOUGH IS REASON THAT THERE'S

06:05:22.734 --> 06:05:23.801
RATES WERE AND IN THIS

06:05:23.868 --> 06:05:24.736
PARTICULAR PROGRAM WAS

06:05:24.802 --> 06:05:26.271
IMPLEMENTED WAS BECAUSE IT WAS

06:05:26.337 --> 06:05:27.972
THOUGHT TO BE NECESSARY TO CARE

06:05:28.039 --> 06:05:30.908
PROPERLY FOR THESE PARTICULAR-

06:05:30.975 --> 06:05:33.544
YOUTH SO. TAKING IT AWAY IS

06:05:33.611 --> 06:05:35.013
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO HAVE SOME

06:05:35.079 --> 06:05:36.547
SORT OF NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THEM

06:05:36.614 --> 06:05:38.850
AND I JUST AM CURIOUS ABOUT HOW

06:05:38.916 --> 06:05:40.518
WE EXPECT PARENTS IN THE

06:05:40.585 --> 06:05:42.186
RECRUITMENT EFFORT FRANKLY TO

06:05:42.253 --> 06:05:43.421
RICK YOU NEED TO RECRUIT

06:05:43.488 --> 06:05:45.957
PARENTS TO TAKE ON. HE'S WITH

06:05:46.024 --> 06:05:47.625
CHALLENGES LIKE THESE SO THAT

06:05:47.692 --> 06:05:48.760
THEY ARE IN THE HOME AND THEY

06:05:48.826 --> 06:05:50.261
CAN THRIVE AND BE SUCCESSFUL

06:05:50.328 --> 06:05:51.696
AND BUT THE PARENTS ALSO HAVE

06:05:51.763 --> 06:05:53.831
THE AT THE RESOURCES TO CARE

06:05:53.898 --> 06:05:55.633
FOR THEM PROPERLY. I APPRECIATE

06:05:55.700 --> 06:05:57.735
THAT THE ONE THING I- WAITED

06:05:57.802 --> 06:06:00.104
CLARIFY. IS THAT NO ONE WOULD

06:06:00.171 --> 06:06:02.440
BE RECEIVING A RATE. REDUCTION

06:06:02.507 --> 06:06:03.708

HAPPEN IS THAT SOME OF THE

06:06:08.079 --> 06:06:09.447
HIGHER RATES THAT OTHERWISE

06:06:09.514 --> 06:06:11.482
MIGHT HAVE BEEN IMPLEMENTED TO

06:06:11.549 --> 06:06:13.384
ADDITIONAL FAMILIES. THEY WOULD

06:06:13.451 --> 06:06:16.321
NOT BE RECEIVING THAT INCREASE-

06:06:16.387 --> 06:06:18.723
BUT THEY WILL NOT BE RECEIVING

06:06:18.790 --> 06:06:22.960

06:09:43.261 --> 06:09:45.763
FOR- BECAUSE THE LOC PROTOCOL

06:09:45.830 --> 06:09:49.967
TOOL HAS NOT YET BEEN.

06:09:50.034 --> 06:09:50.568
IMPLEMENTED FOR THIS PLACEMENT

06:09:50.635 --> 06:09:52.837
TYPE. I AND IN FACT FOR THE

06:09:52.904 --> 06:09:54.405
ROLL OUT OF THE LOC PROTOCOL

06:09:54.472 --> 06:09:56.073
TOOL HAS ACTUALLY BEEN DELAYED

06:09:56.140 --> 06:09:58.142
INDEFINITELY. SO THE

06:09:58.209 --> 06:09:59.410
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

06:09:59.477 --> 06:10:00.811
REALLY IT WOULD SOLIDIFY THAT

06:10:00.878 --> 06:10:01.812
THIS ROLL OUT WOULD NOT BE

06:10:01.879 --> 06:10:03.514
HAPPENING FOR COUNTY FAMILY

06:10:03.581 --> 06:10:05.383
HOMES IN THE BUDGET YEAR. I'M

06:10:05.449 --> 06:10:06.384
GIVEN THESE TWO DISTINCT

06:10:06.450 --> 06:10:08.853
COMPONENTS ONE ALTERNATIVE THE

06:10:08.920 --> 06:10:10.755
LEGISLATURE COULD CONSIDER

06:10:10.821 --> 06:10:11.956
WOULD BE TO CONTINUE TO

06:10:12.023 --> 06:10:13.858
PROVIDE- LOC SKEWED THROUGH

06:10:13.925 --> 06:10:16.561
FORTS AT THAT THEY USE- SO IN

06:10:16.627 --> 06:10:17.895
OUR VIEWTHIS WOULD CONTINUE

06:10:17.962 --> 06:10:20.364
THEIR CURRENT POLICY- WELL

06:10:20.431 --> 06:10:22.033
SUSPENDING THE ROLLOUT OF LOC

06:10:22.099 --> 06:10:24.001
ISSUED THROUGH FOR. TO NINE

06:10:24.068 --> 06:10:25.703
OTHER DAY PLACEMENTS AND AGAIN

06:10:25.770 --> 06:10:27.038
THIS IS ALREADY BEEN DELAYED

06:10:27.104 --> 06:10:28.406
AND LIKELY WOULD NOT HAVE

06:10:28.472 --> 06:10:29.874
HAPPENED WITHIN THE BUDGET

06:10:29.941 --> 06:10:32.176
YEAR- ANYHOW. WHILE THIS

06:10:32.243 --> 06:10:34.345
ALTERNATIVE WOULD ACHIEVE LESS

06:10:34.412 --> 06:10:35.513
SAVINGS THAN THE

06:10:35.580 --> 06:10:37.481
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL- AND

06:10:37.548 --> 06:10:38.649
ARGUE IT WOULD CONTINUE CURRENT

06:10:38.716 --> 06:10:40.518
POLICY AND WE ARE CURRENTLY

06:10:40.585 --> 06:10:41.886
WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT TO

06:10:41.953 --> 06:10:43.588
UNDERSTAND JUST HOW MUCH THIS

06:10:43.654 --> 06:10:45.323
ALTERNATIVE COULD COST SO THANK

06:10:45.389 --> 06:10:46.624

WE WORK THROUGH. THIS

06:11:10.781 --> 06:11:11.349
PARTICULAR ISSUE ON THE BUDGET.

EARLIER. WE HAVE A BUDGET

06:11:43.314 --> 06:11:45.216
DEFICIT THAT'S REJECTED ME ON A

06:11:45.282 --> 06:11:46.884
MULTI YEAR BASIS SO WE NEED AN

06:11:46.951 --> 06:11:48.819
ONGOING SOLUTIONS TO ADDRESS

06:11:48.886 --> 06:11:50.621
THAT PROBLEM SO THAT'S THE

06:11:50.688 --> 06:11:52.089
REASON WHY MAY REVISION NEXUS

TO MAKE THE POINT THAT S. ISIS

06:12:06.837 --> 06:12:09.173
P. CONSISTS OF BOTH THE STATE

06:12:09.240 --> 06:12:10.808
PROVIDED US IS P. GRANT AND

06:12:10.875 --> 06:12:12.376
THEN ALO THE FEDERALLY

06:12:12.443 --> 06:12:14.478
PROVIDED ASSISTS I GRANT SO

06:12:14.545 --> 06:12:16.280
YOUR AGENDA MAKES NOTE OF THE

06:12:16.347 --> 06:12:17.848
ESTIMATED TOTAL LOSSES ISIS P.

06:12:17.915 --> 06:12:20.484
GRANT LEVELS AS ESTIMATED BACK

06:12:20.551 --> 06:12:23.020
IN JANUARY- RELATIVE TO THE

06:12:23.087 --> 06:12:24.455
JANUARY ESTIMATES THE MAY

06:12:24.522 --> 06:12:27.558
REVISION- SHOWS THAT TOTAL

06:12:27.625 --> 06:12:31.028
SIZES S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS-

06:12:31.095 --> 06:12:32.930
ARE ESTIMATED TO BE LOWER. AND

06:12:32.997 --> 06:12:34.265
THIS IS IN PART DUE TO THE

06:12:34.331 --> 06:12:36.701
PROPOSAL TO NOT PASS THROUGH

06:12:36.767 --> 06:12:38.002
THE FEDERALIST ASIDE COST OF

06:12:38.069 --> 06:12:40.938
LIVING ADJUSTMENT OR COLA IN

06:12:41.005 --> 06:12:41.439
TWENTY TWENTY ONE WHICH

06:12:41.505 --> 06:12:43.808
ESSENTIALLY MEANS REDUCING THE

06:12:43.874 --> 06:12:46.844
STATE S. S. P. GRANTS ARE BY-

06:12:46.911 --> 06:12:48.746
THE AMOUNT OF THE FEDERAL SSI

06:12:48.813 --> 06:12:51.148
COLA IN THE PAST RECESSIONS THE

06:12:51.215 --> 06:12:53.317
STATE WAS ABLE TO REDUCE AS P.

06:12:53.384 --> 06:12:55.286
GRANT LEVELS BY THE FULL AMOUNT

06:12:55.352 --> 06:12:57.054
OF THE FEDERALIST COLA WHICH

06:12:57.121 --> 06:12:58.856
WOULD RESULT IN GRANT LEVELS

06:12:58.923 --> 06:13:00.725
REMAINING FLAT YEAR TO YEAR-

06:13:00.791 --> 06:13:02.226
HOWEVER IN THIS CASE WE WOULD

06:13:02.293 --> 06:13:02.993
NOTE THAT BECAUSE OF THE

06:13:03.060 --> 06:13:05.629
FEDERALLY REQUIRED. MINIMUM

06:13:05.696 --> 06:13:08.165
GRANT AMOUNT TOTAL SIZE IS P.

06:13:08.232 --> 06:13:10.067
GRANT LEVELS MAY ACTUALLY STILL

06:13:10.134 --> 06:13:13.771
SEE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN TWENTY

06:13:13.838 --> 06:13:14.839
TWENTY ONE RELATIVE TO TWENTY

06:13:14.905 --> 06:13:17.174
TWENTY LEVELS- I'M CURRENTLY IN

06:13:17.241 --> 06:13:19.176
THE STATE S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS

06:13:19.243 --> 06:13:20.611
ARE SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE

06:13:20.678 --> 06:13:23.314
FEDERALLY REQUIRED MINIMUM- FOR

06:13:23.380 --> 06:13:24.949
THE MAXIMUM INDIVIDUAL GRANTS

06:13:25.015 --> 06:13:27.451
WERE ABOUT FIVE DOLLARS ABOVE-

06:13:27.518 --> 06:13:28.686
WHEREAS FOR THE MAXIMUM COUPLES

06:13:28.753 --> 06:13:30.354
GRANTS FOR ABOUT ELEVEN DOLLARS

06:13:30.421 --> 06:13:32.223
ABOVE THE FEDERAL MINIMUM. I'M

06:13:32.289 --> 06:13:33.090
SO BASED OFF OF THE

06:13:33.157 --> 06:13:34.725
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATE OF

06:13:34.792 --> 06:13:37.595
THE FEDERAL SSI COLA IT IS OUR

06:13:37.661 --> 06:13:38.996
SIZE MEANT THAT THE STATE CAN

06:13:39.063 --> 06:13:41.098
ONLY DECREASE S. S. P. GRANT

06:13:41.165 --> 06:13:43.734
AMOUNTS BY A PORTION OF THE

06:13:43.801 --> 06:13:45.369
FEDERAL INCREASE TO THE SSI

06:13:45.436 --> 06:13:47.471
GRANTS IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN

06:13:47.538 --> 06:13:49.340
FEDERAL REQUIRED IN ORDER TO

06:13:49.406 --> 06:13:50.641
MAINTAIN GRANT LEVELS AT THE

06:13:50.708 --> 06:13:51.876
FEDERALLY REQUIRED MINIMUM

06:13:51.942 --> 06:13:53.711
AMOUNT. SO AS A RESULT WE

06:13:53.778 --> 06:13:55.212
ANTICIPATE THAT THE TOTAL IS A

06:13:55.279 --> 06:13:57.114
SCIENCE IS P. GRANT LEVELS WILL

06:13:57.181 --> 06:13:58.816
STILL EXPERIENCE AGAIN A SLIGHT

06:13:58.883 --> 06:14:06.157
INCREASE IN TWENTY. TWENTY ONE

06:14:06.223 --> 06:14:07.191
ALBEIT BY A LOWER MOUNT OPTION

06:14:07.258 --> 06:14:09.026
OF THIS FOR. HOWEVER WE WOULD

06:14:09.093 --> 06:14:09.660
NOTE THAT OVER WE ASK KNOW THE

06:14:09.727 --> 06:14:10.995
AND OF THE FEDERAL A CYCLE AND

06:14:11.061 --> 06:14:12.329
DOES THE FINAL OF STATE S. S.

06:14:12.396 --> 06:14:14.698
P. GRANT RIGHT UNTIL THE FALL

06:14:14.765 --> 06:14:18.769
OF TWENTY TWENTY. HEY THANK YOU

06:14:18.836 --> 06:14:24.275
QUESTIONS REMEMBERS RIGHT. SO I

06:14:24.341 --> 06:14:25.376
WOULD JUST MAKE THE OBSERVATION

06:14:25.442 --> 06:14:26.410
I NOTICED SOMETHING WE'VE DONE

06:14:26.477 --> 06:14:29.580
BEFORE PASS BUDGET TIMES- BUT I

06:14:29.647 --> 06:14:33.184
DO. FIND IT- AND- AROUND EXTRA

06:14:33.250 --> 06:14:34.819
RATE WORD THAT ON ONE HAND

06:14:34.885 --> 06:14:36.220
WE'RE HOPING THE FEDERAL

06:14:36.287 --> 06:14:37.154
GOVERNMENT WILL PROVIDE US

06:14:37.221 --> 06:14:41.458
FUNDS- TO FILL AND YOU KNOW WE

06:14:41.525 --> 06:14:43.828
HAVE DISTRIBUTORS WERE GOING TO

06:14:43.894 --> 06:14:44.962
PUT IN PLACE IN THE BUDGET. AND

06:14:45.029 --> 06:14:46.197
YET AT THE IMES WHEN THE

06:14:46.263 --> 06:14:47.531
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DOES GIVE US

06:14:47.598 --> 06:14:48.799
MORE MONEY FOR A PARTICULAR

06:14:48.866 --> 06:14:51.869
PURPOSE IN THIS CASE TO THESE-

06:14:51.936 --> 06:14:54.471
PEOPLE ON. SSI THEN WE TAKE THE

06:14:54.538 --> 06:14:55.806
MONEY AND WE PUT IT SOMEWHERE

06:14:55.873 --> 06:14:58.075
ELSE AND I'M NOT SURE WHAT KIND

06:14:58.142 --> 06:14:59.543
OF MESSAGE WE'RE SENDING WE DO

06:14:59.610 --> 06:15:01.412
THAT- SO I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND

06:15:01.478 --> 06:15:03.013
WE HAVE A BUDGET CHALLENGE AND

06:15:03.080 --> 06:15:05.850
WE'VE GOT TO WORK ON THAT- BUT

06:15:05.916 --> 06:15:08.118
I ALSO KNOW THIS IS A- AREA

06:15:08.185 --> 06:15:09.987
WHERE WE'VE SPENT UNDER FUNDING

06:15:10.054 --> 06:15:11.322
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO LOOK AT

06:15:11.388 --> 06:15:12.323
STRUGGLING WITH TRYING TO

06:15:12.389 --> 06:15:13.023
FIGURE OUT HOW TO GET MORE

06:15:13.090 --> 06:15:14.491
FUNDING TO THESE. THESE

06:15:14.558 --> 06:15:16.360
INDIVIDUALS. WHO HAVE

06:15:16.427 --> 06:15:18.863
DISABILITIES. AND FINALLY WHEN

06:15:18.929 --> 06:15:20.497
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ACTUALLY

06:15:20.564 --> 06:15:22.132
GIVES US SOME MORE MONEY WE ARE

06:15:22.199 --> 06:15:23.567
THEN AT LEAST TAKING A PORTION

06:15:23.634 --> 06:15:27.137
OF IT AWAY. TO FOR OTHER THINGS

06:15:27.204 --> 06:15:30.808
SO- I'D- JUST A- TROUBLED BY

06:15:30.875 --> 06:15:32.376
THAT LET'S JUST LEAVE IT AT

06:15:32.443 --> 06:15:35.012
THAT. FOR RIGHT NOW OKAY AND-

06:15:35.079 --> 06:15:37.248
HOPEFULLY ACTUALLY JESSICA SO I

06:15:37.314 --> 06:15:38.782
UNDERSTAND LOL USED YOU SAID

06:15:38.849 --> 06:15:40.017
THAT WE WON'T ACTUALLY KNOW

06:15:40.084 --> 06:15:42.186
UNTIL THE FALL AS TO EXACTLY

06:15:42.253 --> 06:15:44.188
HOW MUCH BUT- YOUR-

06:15:44.255 --> 06:15:45.489
DETERMINATION BASED ON WHAT YOU

06:15:45.556 --> 06:15:48.959
JUST PRESENTED THAT WE'RE

06:15:49.026 --> 06:15:49.526
PROBABLY NOT REALLY GOING TO

06:15:49.593 --> 06:15:50.828
GET. THE THIRTY THREE POINT

06:15:50.895 --> 06:15:53.664
SEVEN MILLION- GENERAL FUND BY

06:15:53.731 --> 06:15:56.467
SHIFTING IS PROBABLY NOT. AS

06:15:56.533 --> 06:15:57.101
PART OF THE LESSON THAT IS THAT

06:15:57.167 --> 06:16:03.107
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING. I KNOW WHAT

06:16:03.173 --> 06:16:06.243
WE'RE SAYING IS WE CAN PRODUCE

06:16:06.310 --> 06:16:08.045
S. S. P. GRANT LEVELS BY THE

06:16:08.112 --> 06:16:10.047
CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE TOTAL

06:16:10.114 --> 06:16:12.483
FEDERAL SSI GRAIN WHAT. I'M SO

06:16:12.549 --> 06:16:13.550
THAT THIRTY THREE REALLY

06:16:13.617 --> 06:16:15.819
REFLECTS ON THE MAX AMOUNT OF

06:16:15.886 --> 06:16:17.288
SAVINGS WE CAN ACTUALLY GET OUT

06:16:17.354 --> 06:16:19.657
OF THE S. S. P. GRANTS ITSELF

06:16:19.723 --> 06:16:20.157
DO YOU DO TAT FEDERALLY

06:16:20.224 --> 06:16:21.859
REQUIRED MINIMUM THRESHOLD.

06:16:21.926 --> 06:16:23.594
THOSE THINGS ARE LIKELY TO GET

06:16:23.661 --> 06:16:27.231
LESS THAN THAT RIGHT BECAUSE OF

06:16:27.298 --> 06:16:29.566
THAT MINIMUM CORRECT. NO I'M

06:16:29.633 --> 06:16:30.801
THE THIRTY D. REPRESENTS THE

06:16:30.868 --> 06:16:32.102
MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF SAVINGS WE

06:16:32.169 --> 06:16:34.805
COULD GET OKAY. OKAY SO THAT SO

06:16:34.872 --> 06:16:36.307
THAT WE COULD WE WILL GET THAT

06:16:36.373 --> 06:16:37.341
SERVICE THE THIRTY SEVEN

06:16:37.408 --> 06:16:38.075
REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE

06:16:38.142 --> 06:16:39.877
BETWEEN THE MINIMUM WE NEED TO

06:16:39.944 --> 06:16:43.013
GET AND THIS AND HOW MUCH WELL.

06:16:43.080 --> 06:16:45.349
PREVIOUSLY PROVED WRAPPERS FOR

06:16:45.416 --> 06:16:47.785
S. S. P. I YES BETWEEN CURRENT

06:16:47.851 --> 06:16:49.286
LEVELS AND THEN THE FEDERAL

06:16:49.353 --> 06:16:51.588
MINIMUM AND THE DIFFERENCE IS

06:16:51.655 --> 06:16:52.389

WORKLOAD THAT THEY ALREADY

AT. EACH COUNTY. BECAUSE THE

THE 7% REDUCTION- JUST KEY

06:21:05.042 --> 06:21:06.510
QUESTIONS THAT THE LEGISLATURE

06:21:06.577 --> 06:21:07.811
MAY WANT TO CONSIDER AS

06:21:07.878 --> 06:21:09.813
PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ONE-

06:21:09.880 --> 06:21:11.348
WHETHER THIS WOULD BE ALLOWABLE

06:21:11.415 --> 06:21:12.749
UNDER THE NEW FEDERAL RULES

06:21:12.816 --> 06:21:14.685

MEDICAID PROGRAMS ALSO GETTING

06:21:22.659 --> 06:21:24.895
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT

06:21:24.962 --> 06:21:26.730
STEPS THE DEPARTMENT- WOULD

06:21:26.797 --> 06:21:28.398
TAKE TO MITIGATE ANY POTENTIAL

06:21:28.465 --> 06:21:32.369
NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON THE- SAFETY

06:21:32.436 --> 06:21:33.804
AND HEALTH I JUST AS

06:21:33.870 --> 06:21:37.007
RECIPIENTS. AND LASTLY- GETTING

06:21:37.074 --> 06:21:38.375
A BETTER UNDERSTANDING HOW A

06:21:38.442 --> 06:21:39.843
POSSIBLE LITIGATION ON THIS

06:21:39.910 --> 06:21:43.580
POINT COULD AFFECT THE TIMING

06:21:43.647 --> 06:21:45.649
OF THE SAVINGS THEMSELVES. OKAY

06:21:45.716 --> 06:21:47.184
THANK YOU- AND FINANCE ANY

06:21:47.251 --> 06:21:48.852
FURTHER COMMENTS CENTER YOU

06:21:48.919 --> 06:21:51.655
ANSWERED QUESTION NUMBER TWO.

06:21:51.722 --> 06:21:52.256
ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS ON ONE

06:21:52.322 --> 06:21:56.994
AND THREE. NO I DIDN'T ASK HER

06:21:57.060 --> 06:21:59.763
OKAY ALL RIGHT OKAY GOING TO

06:21:59.830 --> 06:22:00.297
COMMITTEE QUESTIONS FROM

06:22:00.364 --> 06:22:04.067
COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NO ALL RIGHT.

06:22:04.134 --> 06:22:08.105
SO THE FIRST OF ALL. I THINK

06:22:08.171 --> 06:22:09.573
SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS

06:22:09.640 --> 06:22:11.208
I MADE ABOUT THE M. S. S. P.

06:22:11.275 --> 06:22:13.076
PROGRAM AT SEA BASS SAME WITH

06:22:13.143 --> 06:22:17.714
HSS. WE DO HAVE- INFORMATION

06:22:17.781 --> 06:22:19.349
THAT- ISIS S. REDUCES

06:22:19.416 --> 06:22:20.884
INITIALIZATION LOUD PEOPLE TO

06:22:20.951 --> 06:22:22.719
STAY AT HOME- WHICH IS LESS

06:22:22.786 --> 06:22:25.822
COSTLY THAN. BEING

06:22:25.889 --> 06:22:28.625
INSTITUTIONALIZED AND THAT'S A

06:22:28.692 --> 06:22:30.327
AND THE LONG TERM CARE FACILITY

06:22:30.394 --> 06:22:32.529
AND I THINK THAT IF WE'RE TRULY

06:22:32.596 --> 06:22:34.064
GOING TO IDENTIFY WHAT THE

06:22:34.131 --> 06:22:36.333
ACTUAL SAVINGS ARE FROM A

06:22:36.400 --> 06:22:38.435
REDUCTION IN SERVICE HOURS WE

06:22:38.502 --> 06:22:40.404
ALSO HAVE TO RECOGNIZE WHAT'S

06:22:40.470 --> 06:22:42.306
THE COST OF THE ALTERNATIVE SO

06:22:42.372 --> 06:22:43.907
THE ALTERNATIVE IS YOU KNOW

06:22:43.974 --> 06:22:45.108
WEEDS NOW WE'RE LIMITED THE

06:22:45.175 --> 06:22:46.543
HOURS AND SELF A CERTAIN

06:22:46.610 --> 06:22:49.279
PORTION. OF PEOPLE WHO THOSE

06:22:49.346 --> 06:22:50.747
HOURS OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

06:22:50.814 --> 06:22:51.648
THEM BE ABLE TO STAY AT HOME

06:22:51.715 --> 06:22:53.216
VERSUS BEING INSTITUTIONALIZED

06:22:53.283 --> 06:22:54.851
WHICH IS MUCH MORE EXPENSIVE WE

06:22:54.918 --> 06:22:58.488
NEED TO FACTOR THAT COST IN. SO

06:22:58.555 --> 06:23:00.524
AND CAN BE HARD TO DETERMINE

06:23:00.590 --> 06:23:02.492
BUT- I THINK WE NEED TO

06:23:02.559 --> 06:23:03.660
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT THEN

06:23:03.727 --> 06:23:06.663
BECOMES A VERY REAL COST. THE

06:23:06.730 --> 06:23:08.665
OTHER ISSUE- AND GUESTS ARE

06:23:08.732 --> 06:23:09.800
SIMILAR TO WHAT I SAID ABOUT A

06:23:09.866 --> 06:23:11.601
SOCIETY IS THAT YES ON ONE

06:23:11.668 --> 06:23:13.070
LEVEL WERE HOPING FOR FEDERAL

06:23:13.136 --> 06:23:14.805
MONEY TO HELP MAKE UP SOME OF

06:23:14.871 --> 06:23:17.774
THE GAPS. AND SO WE WERE DOING

06:23:17.841 --> 06:23:20.344
THIS TRIGGER THING. BUT SAME

06:23:20.410 --> 06:23:21.044
TIME TO THROW MONEY AT THE

06:23:21.111 --> 06:23:23.547
FEDERAL. WELL THE FEDERAL

06:23:23.613 --> 06:23:24.181
GOVERNMENT HAS PROVIDED US AN

06:23:24.247 --> 06:23:26.683
ENHANCED. F. MAP THAT RELATE TO

06:23:26.750 --> 06:23:28.852
THE DISASTER. AND WE'RE TAKING

06:23:28.919 --> 06:23:30.187
SOME OF THOSE FUNDS AND THEN RE

06:23:30.253 --> 06:23:32.422
DIVERTING IT SOMEWHERE ELSE. SO

06:23:32.489 --> 06:23:33.623
THE FEDS COULD COME AND SAY

06:23:33.690 --> 06:23:34.858
WELL BY THE WAY WE DID GIVE YOU

06:23:34.925 --> 06:23:36.159
MORE MONEY HE JUST DIDN'T SPEND

06:23:36.226 --> 06:23:38.328
IT ON WHAT YOU CHOOSE TO SPEND

06:23:38.395 --> 06:23:39.896
IT ON THE ITEM WE ACTUALLY GAVE

06:23:39.963 --> 06:23:41.465
YOU THE ENHANCED PAYMENT FOR.

06:23:41.531 --> 06:23:43.567
SUCH AS I. HSS OR BETTER CAL OR

06:23:43.633 --> 06:23:45.535
SO FORTH YOU DECIDE TAKE THAT

06:23:45.602 --> 06:23:46.269
INCREASE AND SEND IT SOMEWHERE

06:23:46.336 --> 06:23:48.405
ELSE. AND I THINK THAT WEAKENS

06:23:48.472 --> 06:23:50.674
OUR POSITION TO BE ABLE TO ASK

06:23:50.741 --> 06:23:53.777
FOR EVEN MORE FUNDING SO- SO I

06:23:53.844 --> 06:23:54.711
THINK THAT'S THAT'S A BIT

06:23:54.778 --> 06:23:57.114
CHALLENGING AS WELL I MEAN- YOU

06:23:57.180 --> 06:23:58.048
KNOW WE'LL SEE WHAT CONGRESS

06:23:58.115 --> 06:24:02.519
AND- AND SO FORTH THAT. DO AND

06:24:02.586 --> 06:24:03.754
THEN THE OTHER PIECE CERTAINLY

06:24:03.820 --> 06:24:06.757
IS- THE FEDERAL RULES AROUND IT

06:24:06.823 --> 06:24:07.924
AS WELL I KNOW THAT- IS BROUGHT

06:24:07.991 --> 06:24:09.393
THIS UP TO MULTIPLE OCCASIONS

06:24:09.459 --> 06:24:12.863
BUT- WELL I JUST ASK- FINANCE-

06:24:12.929 --> 06:24:14.464
IS DEAD. I MEAN WHAT'S THE

06:24:14.531 --> 06:24:15.632
LEVEL OF CONFIDENCE IN THE

06:24:15.699 --> 06:24:16.700
ADMINISTRATION THAT THE

06:24:16.767 --> 06:24:18.902
PROPOSED CUTS THAT YOU'RE

06:24:18.969 --> 06:24:20.604
MAKING- PARTICULARLY TO.

06:24:20.670 --> 06:24:26.810
CERTAIN PROGRAMS- DON'T VIOLATE

06:24:26.877 --> 06:24:28.378
THE PARAMETERS DASHED WISH FOR.

06:24:28.445 --> 06:24:30.547
US WE THE ENHANCED MAPS A

06:24:30.614 --> 06:24:32.682
RESULT OF THE DISASTER SO WE-

06:24:32.749 --> 06:24:34.418
AS EARLIER POINTED OUT THERE

06:24:34.484 --> 06:24:35.585
ARE OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE TO

06:24:35.652 --> 06:24:37.287
MEET. DOOR TO GET THAT ENHANCED

06:24:37.354 --> 06:24:40.957
F. MAP- CAN YOU SPEAK TO. THE

06:24:41.024 --> 06:24:45.328
MINISTRATIONS- WELL. CONFIDENCE

06:24:45.395 --> 06:24:47.297

UNEMPLOYED AND THEREFORE I HAVE

06:33:08.398 --> 06:33:09.599
A LOT OF WORK READY SKILLS

06:33:09.666 --> 06:33:12.068
ALREADY- A LOT OF COUNTIES AND

06:33:12.135 --> 06:33:13.603
ADVOCATES MADE THE

06:33:13.670 --> 06:33:15.638
COUNTERPOINT. THAT MANY OF

06:33:15.705 --> 06:33:17.774
THESE FOLKS WILL BE COMING FROM

06:33:17.840 --> 06:33:19.642
INDUSTRIES LIKE HOSPITALITY

06:33:19.709 --> 06:33:22.178
SECTOR THAT MAY TAKE A VERY

06:33:22.245 --> 06:33:24.681
LONG TIME TO RECOVER FROM THE

06:33:24.747 --> 06:33:26.783
CURRENT ECONOMIC COLLAPSE BUT

06:33:26.849 --> 06:33:28.685
IN THE US MAY REQUIRE INTENSIVE

06:33:28.751 --> 06:33:30.453
SUPPORT TO RETRAIN FOR OTHER

06:33:30.520 --> 06:33:33.623
DISTRICTS- IT ALSO LOOK BACK AT

06:33:33.690 --> 06:33:34.557
THE STATES EXPERIENCED DURING

06:33:34.624 --> 06:33:35.992
THE GREAT RECESSION AND SAW

06:33:36.059 --> 06:33:37.827
THAT THERE WAS ONLY A MODEST

06:33:37.894 --> 06:33:39.629
DECREASE IN THE REALISATION

06:33:39.696 --> 06:33:40.830
IMPLEMENT SERVICES AT THAT

06:33:40.897 --> 06:33:42.598
TIME. AND THAT REALLY WASN'T

06:33:42.665 --> 06:33:44.400
EVEN AN ORGANIC DECREASE THAT

06:33:44.467 --> 06:33:49.672
WAS SPURRED ON BY DELIBERATE.

06:33:49.739 --> 06:33:50.273

EMPLOYMENT OR YOU THINK THIS IS

06:33:56.846 --> 06:33:57.947
AN AREA WHERE THE LEGISLATURE

06:33:58.014 --> 06:34:00.083
MAY WISH TO CONSIDER MORE

06:34:00.149 --> 06:34:02.151
MODEST REDUCTION OF ONE OF THE

06:34:02.218 --> 06:34:04.854
CRITERIA THAT WE EMPHASIZE IN

06:34:04.921 --> 06:34:06.222
ANALYZING MAY REVISION

PROPOSALS WAS THE LEGISLATURE'S

06:34:08.624 --> 06:34:10.093
INTEREST IN NOT MAKING POLICY

06:34:10.159 --> 06:34:12.395
DECISIONS THAT MIGHT WORSEN THE

06:34:12.462 --> 06:34:14.163
CURRENT ECONOMIC DOWNTURN OR

06:34:14.230 --> 06:34:16.099
DAMPEN FUTURE ECONOMIC

06:34:16.165 --> 06:34:18.768
RECOVERY. SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT

06:34:18.835 --> 06:34:20.737
IS ONE OF THE OF THOSE PROGRAMS

06:34:20.803 --> 06:34:23.139
THAT HAS GENERALLY BEEN SEEN TO

06:34:23.206 --> 06:34:25.408
HAVE A POSITIVE MACROECONOMIC

06:34:25.475 --> 06:34:27.744
SACKED THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

06:34:29.712 --> 06:34:30.880
CAUSING SUBSIDIZED EMPLOYMENT

06:34:30.947 --> 06:34:33.149
DURING THE LAST RECESSION IN

06:34:33.216 --> 06:34:36.085
STUDIES OF THAT- EXPENDITURE

06:34:36.152 --> 06:34:38.388
THAT GENERALLY BEEN POSITIVE SO

06:34:38.454 --> 06:34:40.156
THE LEGISLATURE MAY BE BASED TO

06:34:40.223 --> 06:34:41.791

LEGISLATURE. NEEDS TO BE AWARE

06:34:58.207 --> 06:35:00.810

06:35:16.426 --> 06:35:16.926
GROUND AND STARTED RUNNING.

06:35:16.993 --> 06:35:17.460
