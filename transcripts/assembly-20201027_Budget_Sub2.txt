THE HEARING TODAY IS OT ABOUT DISTANCE LEARNING IN THE ISSUES FOCUSED ON THAT- THOSE ARE DEEP CRITICAL CONVERSATIONS- ON THE ON THEIR OWN WE SAID WE RESPECT DOESN'T SUPPORT THOSE BUT TODAY I'M GONNA ASK MY COLLEAGUES IN THE PANELISTS TO BE LASER FOCUSED ON THE QUOTE ON THIS QUESTION WHAT IS THE STATE'S RESPONSIBILITY ENSURING THE SAFE RETURN OF OUR STUDENTS TO AT LEAST SOME IN PERSON ENGAGEMENT. DURING THIS PANDEMIC SOME DISTRICTS HAVE STARTED SOME WILL START THE NEXT FEW WEEKS LIKE WE HEARD HERE LOCALLY IN SACRAMENTO SOME OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE ANNOUNCED THAT IF THINGS ARE GOING ACCORDINGLY- AS THEY ARE NOW WITH WITH THE NUMBERS ACCOUNTS FOR PUBLIC HEALTH EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE CAN'T JUST RE OPEN WE MAKE SURE IT'S SAFE WE HAVE TO. BALANCE BOTH AT THE FOCUS ON SOCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND PREVENTING COMMUNITY SPREAD- WHEN THE LEGISLATURE PASSED THE FINAL BUDGET IN AUGUST. WE ASSUME THAT IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WITH GOING TO BE THE DEEP. MODE OF CONDUCT EVANS. FOR MOST OF THE STUDENTS FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WE ALL KNOW THAT'S NOT HAPPENING DUE TO THE SECOND WAVE. OF THE CLUB IN NINETEEN AND AT THIS POINT FORTY A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ARE. NOW ALLOWED TO REOPEN A WITHOUT A WAIVER. AND MANY OF THESE ARE LOCAL DECISIONS.

LIMON MEDINA PRESIDENT O'DONNELL YOUR- OKAY THAT'S THE ROLE FOR COURSE FOR THE BUDGET STEP TWO WE HAVE THREE ADDITIONAL MEMBERS JOINING US FOR THE DAY AS GUEST OF THE COMMITTEE NOT SO WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN WITH THE FIRST- PANEL WE'RE GONNA START WITH THE L. A. L. ARE YOU HERE. YES GOOD MORNING MEMBERS A NEARLY WHAT THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE BEFORE I BEGIN MY PRESENTATION WOULD IT BE POSSIBLE TO GET CONFIRMATION FROM THE MEMBERS THAT YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY YES WE CAN AND JUST SO. YOU CAN HEAR US JUST JUST REMINDER FOR ALL THE SPEAKERS ARE ASKING YOU. TO KEEP YOUR COMMENTS FIVE MINUTES PER INDIVIDUAL. FIVE MINUTES PER INDIVIDUAL THANK YOU. OKAY I AM JOINED BY- MY TWO COLLEAGUES FROM THE ALEJO SO WHEN YOU PICK A COVERS PUBLIC HEALTH FOR OFFICE AND EDGAR CABRAL WHO IS THE DEPUTY OF THE K. TWELVE SECTION. SIR THIS MORNING WE'VE BEEN ASKED TO SPEAK ABOUT THE STATUS OF SCHOOL OPENINGS IN THE STATE. AND SHARE ANY BEST PRACTICES FOR HOW THE STATE CAN SUPPORT AS SCHOOLS RE OPENING FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. GENERALLY WHAT WE FOUND IS THAT SCHOOLS ARE RECEIVING A LOT OF GUIDANCE ABOUT WHAT TO CONSIDER FOR RE OPENING. BUT NOT WHAT THEY NEED TO DO TO REOPEN. FURTHERMORE HOUSE SEATS CAN BEST SUPPORT SCHOOL REOPENING AND MITIGATING KOBE NINETEEN TRANSMISSIONS IN SCHOOLS. REMAINS LARGELY UNCLEAR AT OUR USUALLY JUST DUE TO THE SHORT TIMEFRAME WE'VE HAD TO OBSERVE OTHER STATES REOPENING SCHOOLS. I'M BUT WE WILL PROVIDE SOME POTENTIAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE STATE TO HELP SCHOOLS NAVIGATE THIS. UNCHARTED TERRITORY AND WE PROVIDED A HANDOUT SO EVERYONE CAN FOLLOW ALONG WITH OUR PRESENTATION THIS MORNING. THEY HAND OUT IS ENTITLED RE OPENING SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. SO JUST TURNING IT TO THE FIRST PAGE OF. THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PACKAGE ENVISIONED ESSENTIALLY THREE MODES OF DELIVERY OF THE INSTRUCTIONAL DELIVERY. WITH SCHOOL SWITCHING BETWEEN DIFFERENT MODES DEPENDING ON HOW WIDESPREAD THE VIRUS AS- FIRST IS IN PERTH FULL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WHICH IS TRADITIONAL LEARNING WITH TEACHERS AND STUDENTS BACK IN THE CLASSROOM. SECOND IS DISTANCE LEARNING WE'RE ALL LEARNING IS REMOTE AND STUDENTS LARGELY LEARN FROM HOME. AND THEN THIRD IS A HYBRID MODEL WHICH IS A MIX BETWEEN REMOTE LEARNING AND DISTANCE LEARNING. AND THIS IS REALLY INTENDED TO ALLOW FOR PHYSICAL DISTANCING IT BACK IN THE CLASSROOM FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. AT THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET PACKAGE THAT WAS ADOPTED IN JUNE REALLY SET THE EXPECTATIONS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION AS THE DEFAULT. SO DISTRICTS WERE EXPECTED TO OFFER IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO THE GREATEST EXTENT POSSIBLE. TO ALLOW FOR CONTINUITY AND LEARNING. THEIR BUDGET PACKAGE ALSO SET REQUIREMENTS FOR DISTANCE LEARNING. AT THE BUDGET PACKAGE ALSO SUSPENDED REQUIREMENTS FOR ANNUAL INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL FLEXIBILITY TO SCHOOLS. AND ALSO ALLOWED AT SCHOOL IS TO MEET THE MINIMUM INSTRUCTIONAL DAVID. THROUGH A COMPANY OF BOTH PERSON LEARNING AND ADD. LEARNING THE BUDGET ALSO PROVIDED FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS TO HELP SCHOOLS- WITH DISTANCE LEARNING AND SCHOOL RE OPENING. IN AUGUST TO THE GOVERNOR ESTABLISHED A FOUR TIER FRAMEWORK TO HELP GUIDE COUNTY RE OPENINGS AND IS ALSO AFFECTED SCHOOL WE OPENINGS SO THEIR KIDS ARE THE COUNTY'S CALL FALL INTO ONE OF FOUR TIERS. PURPLE WHICH IS WHERE THE VIRAL SPREAD IS MOST WIDESPREAD READ IT WHICH IS WHERE THE VIRAL SPREAD IS SUBSTANTIAL ORANGE WHERE THE VIRAL SPREAD IS MODERATE AND YELLOW WHERE THE VIRAL SPREAD IS MINIMAL. INTO THE TEARS ARE BASED OFF OF COPING NINETEEN CASE RATES PER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE AND TESTING POSITIVITY. SO THERE RE TWO EXCEPTIONS FOR THIS TIERED FRAMEWORK FIRST IS THAT SCHOOLS CAN- BRING BRING BACK SMALL SCOOPS OF STUDENTS WITH HIGH NEEDS AND THESE INCLUDE STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES ENGLISH LEARNERS AND OTHER- STUDENT SUB GROUPS. AND ALSO STUDENTS IN KINDERGARTEN THROUGH GRADE SIX ARE ALLOWED TO COME BACK THROUGH THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WAIVER PROCESS SO WITH PUTTING THOSE TWO EXCEPTIONS ASIDE SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO REOPEN FOR ALL STUDENTS ONCE THE COUNTY IS IN THE RIGHT HERE FOR AT LEAST FOURTEEN DAYS. AND WHAT ALLOWED TO RE OPEN THE ULTIMATE DECISION TO DO SO IS REALLY LEFT UP TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION IN THE CASE OF ALTERNATIVE EDUCATION PROGRAMS AND INDEPENDENTLY OPERATED CHARTER SCHOOLS BUT WE WON'T NOW EVEN THOUGH. I SCHOOLS MAY BE ALLOWED TO OPEN AT THE TIME THAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THAT DECISION AND IMPLEMENT THAT RE OPENING PLANNING TO WORK OUT THE CONDITIONS OF RE OPENING LIKELY DO TAKE SOME TIME. MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. SO THE STATE NOT COAL DATA. ON SCHOOLS HAVE REOPENED FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION THIS FIGURE ON THIS PAGE SHOWS THE SHARE OF K. TWELVE STUDENTS THAT ARE LIVING IN COUNTIES- THAT HAVE. THAT ARE PERMITTED TO REOPEN SCHOOLS UNDER THE TIER FRAMEWORK ON THE HORIZONTAL AXIS ARE THE DATES OF THE STATE UPDATES TO SCHOOL RE OPENING STATUS. OVER ALL YOU CAN SEE THE TREND OVER TIME IS THAT MORE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN ALLOWED TO RE OPEN AND MORE STUDENTS ARE LIVING IN COUNTIES WHERE THEY'RE PERMITTED TO BE OPEN SCHOOLS. THIS LARGELY REFLECTS THE STATE OVER ALL EFFORTS TO LOWER TRANSMISSION AND CASES OF COPING NINETEEN. AS OF OCTOBER NINETEENTH ABOUT HALF OF ALL OF THE STATE'S K. TWELVE STUDENTS ARE IN A COUNTY WHERE SCHOOLS COULD RE OPEN. BUT OUR UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TO DATE MAYBE ONLY A FEW DOZEN OR SO SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE REOPENED IN THE STATE AND MOST OF THE SCHOOLS ARE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION UNDER THE HYBRID MODEL. I'M IN JUST A QUICK NOTE THE DROP THAT YOU SEE BETWEEN OCTOBER TWELFTH AND OCTOBER NINTH NINETEEN IS- RIVERSIDE COUNTY GOING FROM READ IT BACK TO PURPLE. I'M MOVING ON TO THE NEXT PAGE. THE GENERAL WE FIND THAT SCHOOLS HAVE A PLETHORA OF GUIDANCE FROM VARIOUS ENTITIES AT THE STATE LEVEL WE HAVE GUIDANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ADD TO THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAVE A GUIDANCE FROM THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THE CDC. AND THEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE HAVE A GUIDANCE FROM COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION WORKING WITH THEIR LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS. AND HOWEVER AS WE SEE ON THE NEXT PAGE THE GUIDANCE IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT. LEAVING SCHOOL TO MAKE THEIR OWN DECISIONS REGARDING IMPLEMENTATION DETAILS. TO MOVING ON TO THAT NEXT PAGE. HERE YOU CAN SEE A TABLE THAT SHOWS AN EXAMPLE OF RIGHT. YOU CAN SEE AN EXAMPLE OF GUIDANCE ON PHYSICAL DISTANCING THAT'S PROVIDED FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND- ONE SAMPLE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. SO THE GUIDANCE THAT YOU CAN SEE ON THE LEFT MOST COLUMN THE TO FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND ASSIZES MAXIMIZING SPACE BETWEEN STUDENT DESKS. THIS INCLUDES ALLOWING- SIX FEATS OF SIX FEET WORTH OF DISTANCE BETWEEN TASKS BUT IT ALSO ALLOWS FOR OTHER OPTIONS TO CREATE SEPARATION BETWEEN STUDENTS. THESE INCLUDE PROVIDING SUB PARTITIONS BETWEEN DESKS AND ALSO REARRANGING DESK MINIMIZE FACE TO FACE CONTACT. AND THEN IN THAT MIDDLE COLUMN YOU CAN SEE GUIDANCE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH REALLY STRETCHES STRESSES THE SIX SPEED PHYSICAL DISTANCE OBJECTIVES. AND RECOMMENDS THAT SCHOOLS ACTUALLY DETERMINE THE CAMPUS CAPACITY BASED ON THE SUBJECT IT. AND THEN AT THAT THE LAST COLUMN IS- GUIDANCE FROM A SAMPLE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION SERVICE CN'T GUIDANCE STARTS OUT VERY SIMILAR TO THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH EXCEPT IN THE LAST TWO BULLETS WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT. WHEN CULPRITS ARE IN PLACE- THE GUIDANCE ALLOWS FOR SCHOOLS TO RELAX THE SIX FEET RECOMMENDATION AND ALLOWS ESPECIALLY IF IT ALLOWS MORE STUDENTS- TO BENEFIT FROM IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. SO THIS GUIDANCE PRIORITIZES FACE COVERINGS AND STABLE COHORTS OVER PHYSICAL DISTANCING. AS ANOTHER EXAMPLE GUIDANCE WE ALSO CHANGE OVER TIME FOR INSTANCE IN THE JULY SEVENTEENTH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LETTER ON SCHOOL REOPENING. THE COUNT THE DEPARTMENT RECOMMENDED PERIODICALLY TESTING DISTRICT AND SCHOOL STAFF. BUT IN AN UPDATED GUIDANCE RELEASED ON AUGUST THIRD THE DEPARTMENT SAID THE ROLE OF ROUTINE TESTING FOR STAFF AND STUDENTS IT'S CURRENTLY UNCLEAR. I THINK THESE ARE JUST EXAMPLES OF HOW CHALLENGING IT CAN BE FOR SCHOOLS TO NAVIGATE VARIOUS GUIDANCE FROM VARIOUS DIFFERENT ENTITIES. AND HOW TO MAKE SENSE OF HOW ALL OF THIS APPLY TO THEM EXPRESSIONISTIC THE GUIDANCE IS NOT CONSISTENT- SO ALTHOUGH THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS REQUIRES SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO COMPLY WITH DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND- LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDANCE. HOW SCHOOLS. REOPEN AN INTERPRETER EMBLEM IT'S THE GUIDANCE IS LARGELY LEFT UP TO DISTRICT. WOULD BE AND THE NEXT PAGE. SO OFF OF A REVIEW OF THE LATEST RESEARCH THERE ARE STILL MANY UNKNOWNS AND THE GUIDANCE OF BERRIES IT REMAINS UNCLEAR THE BEST PART WHAT THE BEST PRACTICES ARE AND HOW STATES CAN BEST SUPPORT SCHOOLS REOPENING EVEN WHEN SCHOOLS ARE ALLOWED TO REOPEN THIS IS LARGELY DUE TO THE SHORT TIME FRAME AND LIMITED EVIDENCE WE HAVE FOR SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL OPENINGS IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER AND THERE ARE SOME ACTIONS THAT THE STATE CAN CONSIDER TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS LARGELY THIS IS GEARED TOWARDS THE STATE STEPPING IN TO FILL IN ANY POTENTIAL GAPS FIRST MISTAKE PROVIDE MORE TAILORED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOLS I'M RE OPENING PLANS AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THOSE PLANS THIS INCLUDES ON SITE- VIRTUAL CONSULTATIONS FROM A STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICIALS. AND PERHAPS THIS CAN HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE OF TEACHERS. IT'S AND STAFF THAT THE SCHOOLS CANNOT REOPEN SAFELY THAT DISTRICT THAT THE DISTRICT HAS PROPER PRECAUTIONS AND MEASURES IN PLACE TO BOTH MINIMIZE EXPOSURE AND CONTAIN. POTENTIAL OUTBREAKS SECONDLY THE STATE COULD YOU SCHOOL SPECIFIC DATA TO INFORM DECISIONS STARTING WITH TRACKING AND REPORTING COBIT NINETEEN CASES CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF ELEVEN STATES THAT DO NOT REPORT ANY SCHOOL LEVEL DATA. THE STATE COULD ALSO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SUPPORT TO SCHOOLS TO CONTAIN OUTBREAK FOR INSTANCE CASE INVESTIGATION CAN HELP TO DETERMINE WHETHER A TRANSMISSION HAPPENS IN THE SCHOOL OR ELSEWHERE. IN THE STATE ALSO SUPPORT CONTACT TRACING DATA INTERPRETATION AND OTHER RESPONSE MATTERS. LASTLY THE STATE COULD PROVIDE CLEAR GUIDANCE ON KOBE NINETEEN TESTING THIS COULD INCLUDE SUPPORTING OUTSIDE COLLABORATIONS THAT ALLOW SCHOOLS TO DEVELOP TESTING PLANS AND ACCESS ROUTINE TESTING. SCHOOLS IN PLACES LIKE LOS ANGELES AND THE BAY REA MAY HAVE MORE ACCESS TO RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND HIGHER INSTITUTIONS OF EDUCATION THAT MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE. SUPPORT WITH TESTING AND ACCESS TO ROUTINE TESTING FOR OTHER SCHOOLS IN OTHER AREAS OF THE STATE MAY BE MORE CHALLENGING TO FIND ACCESS TO ROUTINE TESTING AND THE SORT OF SUPPORT. THE STATE COULD ALSO PROVIDE MORE GUIDANCE ON RAPID ANTIGEN TESTING AND VACCINES ONCE THEY BECOME AVAILABLE AND MORE WIDESPREAD. WE DO NOT HOWEVER AND THE LAST PAGE THAT THESE ACTIONS COULD REQUIRE ADDITIONAL STATE FUNDING STAFF AND OTHER RESOURCES AND I THINK I'LL JUST STOP THERE BUT I'D BE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK WE'RE GONNA TRY TO GET THE FIRST FOUR AND COME BACK I KNOW I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU. AND NEXT WE HAVE JESSICA HOLMES WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS- JESSICA HOLMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- I'M GOING TO GIVE IT SOME ADDITIONAL BACKGROUND ON THE EFFORTS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION OF TAKEN THUS FAR- TO PROVIDE. THAT SUPPORTS AND RESOURCES TO HELP CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS RE OPEN AND I WILL TRY NOT TO OVERLAP TOO MUCH WITH THE EXCELLENT REMARKS OF MY- L. A. O. COLLEAGUES. I'M AND ALSO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND PUBLIC HEALTH WILL HAVE SOME MORE DETAILED INFORMATION TO SHARE- SO I'LL- TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS HIGH LEVEL. THE ADMINISTRATION IS MINDFUL THAT SCHOOLS NEED CLEAR GUIDANCE AND RESOURCES FROM THE STATE TO HELP THEM RE OPEN. THESE MUST BE PARTNERED WITH A BALANCED MIX OF PROGRAMMATIC AND FISCAL FLEXIBILITY IN RECOGNITION OF DIVERSE LOCAL CIRCUMSTANCES AS WELL AS ACCOUNTABILITY TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE BEING SERVED ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. AS WE NOTED THE STATE HAS ALREADY GONE A LONG WAY TO MEETING THE NEEDS OF SCHOOLS TO REOPEN SAFELY AND THIS IS EVIDENCED BY THE MANY THAT ALREADY HAVE RE OPENED. HOWEVER YOU RECOGNIZE THAT IN A CONSTANTLY EVOLVING SITUATION SUCH AS THE ONE THAT WE'RE IN. THERE'S ALWAYS MORE TO DO AND WE'RE WORKING VERY HARD TO MEET THE NEW CHALLENGES AS THEY ARISE. TO DATE WE HAVE PROVIDED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS. TO HELP THEM ADAPT TO THE CONDITIONS CREATED BY THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. FIRST WE KEPT FUNDING LEVELS FOR K. TWELVE SCHOOLS FLAT FROM TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FUNDING HOLD HARMLESS AND APPORTIONMENT DEFERRALS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT INCLUDED FIFTY FOUR BILLION LASSEN REVENUES OVER THE THREE YEAR PERIOD THAN WAS FIRST ANTICIPATED. WE ALSO PROVIDED AN ADDITIONAL ONE TIME INVESTMENT OF MORE THAN FIVE POINT THREE BILLION FOR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO MITIGATE LEARNING LOSS RELATED TO COPE AT NINETEEN. AND TO PROVIDE STUDENTS SUPPORTS TO ADDRESS BARRIERS TO LEARNING. THESE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED WITH EQUITY IN MND AS WE KNOW THAT THE PANDEMIC AND RELATED RECESSION OF IMPACTED LOWER INCOME FAMILIES THE MOST. AND I'LL STOP HERE FOR A MOMENT JUST TO MENTION THAT- IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITHIN THE ADMINISTRATION. THE NUMBER ONE- FOCUS FOR US HAS REALLY BEEN ON EQUITY AND THAT IS WHY IT WAS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE GOVERNOR. THAT IS FIVE POINT THREE BILLION AT FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESOURCES BE ALLOCATED IN A WAY. WHERE THE MOST FUNDING AND RESOURCES WERE PROVIDED TO OUR LOWEST INCOME ENGLISH LEARNER FOSTER YOUTH. OUR STUDENTS. SCHOOLS WERE A ARE ABLE TO USE THESE FUNDS TO HELP BRIDGE THE DIGITAL DIVIDE ADDRESS HEALTH AND SAFETY CONCERNS. I'M INCREASE LEARNING SUPPORT SERVICES AND INSTRUCTIONAL TIME TO CLOSE LEARNING GAPS RESULTING FROM DISTANCE LEARNING. AND PROVIDE WRAPAROUND SUPPORTS INCLUDING NUTRITION AND MENTAL SERVICES TO HELP STUDENTS OVERCOME BARRIERS TO LEARNING. IN ADDITION THESE FUNDS CAN BE USED IN A VERY IMPORTANT WORK NECESSARY TO REOPEN SCHOOLS. THIS FUNDING WAS AN ADDITION TO ANOTHER ONE POINT FIVE BILLION FEDERAL FUNDS THAT WENT TO TITLE ONE ELIGIBLE SCHOOLS FOR COVERED NINETEEN RELATED PURPOSES AS WELL AS A HUNDRED MILLION PROP NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY COSTS AND SPRING TWENTY TWENTY. FINALLY THE STATE ALSO ALLOCATED NEARLY TWO HUNDRED MILLION. TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS FORTY FIVE MILLION FOR COMMUNITY SCHOOLS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO HEALTH MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL SERVICE SUPPORTS FOR HIGH NEED% STUDENTS. AND SIX MILLION FOR EDUCATIONAL PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT ON HIGH QUALITY DISTANCE LEARNING AND ADDRESSING LEARNING LOSS IN MATHEMATICS SCIENCE ENGLISH LANGUAGE ARTS TEACHER THE PANDEMIC. FINALLY THE CALIFORNIA OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES PROVIDED ALL PUBLIC AND PRIVATE SCHOOLS WITH TWO MONTHS WORTH OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT. TO ASSIST SCHOOLS AND RE OPENING SAFELY. THE STATE ALSO OPENED A STATEWIDE CONTRACT FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY SUPPLIES AVAILABLE FOR ALL LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. EQUIPMENT TO REDUCE COMPETITION AMONG ALLEY ACE. FURTHER THIS THE STATE IS WORKING TO DOUBLE CALIFORNIA'S OVERALL TESTING CAPACITY ENABLING MANY SCHOOLS TO BENEFIT FROM STREAMLINED SUPPLY CHAINS. SPEEDY RESULTS AND BELOW MARKET RATES FOR PCR TESTS. LASTLY HUNDRED TWO STATE DEPARTMENTS DEPLOYED OVER THIRTY FOUR HUNDRED STATE STAFF TO SUPPORT LOCAL CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS INCLUDING AT SCHOOLS THE 97% OF LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO REPORT THAT THEY HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPACITY TO NOTIFY EACH POTENTIAL CONTACT EACH DAY. IN ADDITION TO ALL THESE RESOURCES THE STATE HAS PROVIDED COMPREHENSIVE GUIDANCE AND BEST PRACTICES FOR SCHOOLS TO NAVIGATE THEPANDEMIC SAFELY AND ENSURE THE BEST ACADEMIC OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY'RE LEARNING. IS THAT THE GREEN MADE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND CAL OSHA ISSUED JOINT GUIDANCE ON THE PRECAUTIONS NECESSARY FOR SCHOOLS TO RE OPEN REOPEN SAFELY. FOLLOWED IN JULY BY IS A DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FRAMEWORK TO HELP GUIDE LOCAL DECISIONS ABOUT WHEN SCHOOL SHOULD OPEN AND CLOSE BASED ON LOCAL LOCAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA. FOR COMMUNITIES AT HIGHER RISK OF CARBON NINETEEN SPREAD DEPARTMENT PUBLIC HEALTH PROVIDED A WAIVER OPTION FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS. IN GUIDANCE FOR SERVING SMALL COHORTS OF STUDENTS. THESE OPTIONS ALLOW EVEN THE MOST HEAVILY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES TO PROVIDE TARGETED SERVICES TO OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS. AND THOSE MOST VULNERABLE TO LEARNING LOSS INCLUDING STUDENTS DISABILITIES ENGLISH LEARNERS STUDENTS AT RISK FOR NEGLECT OR ABUSE YOUTH IN FOSTER CAE AND STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT OTHERWISE ABLE TO ENGAGE IN DISTANCE LEARNING. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE CALIFORNIA COLLABORATIVE FOR EDUCATIONAL EXCELLENCE HAVE ALSO DEVELOPED GUIDES AND TOOLS FOR SCHOOLS TO UTILIZE. WHEN PLANNING HOWTO RETURN TO CAMPUS. FINALLY BOTH ENTITIES HAVE PUBLISHED SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND BEST PRACTICES FOR DISTANCE LEARNING TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE ENGAGED AND ARE RECEIVING THE BEST POSSIBLE EDUCATION DURING THIS DIFFICULT TIME. LAST BUT MOST CERTAINLY NOT LEAST THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT PROVIDED LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WITH THE ROAD MAP FOR STAKEHOLDER OUTREACH DURING THE CALL THE NINETEEN PANDEMIC. THROUGH THE CREATION OF THE LEARNING CONTINUITY IN ATTENDANCE PLAN. THROUGH THIS PLAN LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES REQUIRED TO WORK WITH OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES TO DESCRIBE HOW THEY WOULD PROVIDE CONTINUITY OF LEARNING DURING THE COPA NINETEEN PANDEMIC. SPECIFICALLY CALLING OUT HOW THE L. EA WOULD ADDRESS DISTANCE LEARNING LEARNING LOSS. MENTAL HEALTH AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL WELL BEING PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT PEOPLE ENGAGEMENT OUTREACH AND SCHOOL NUTRITION DURING THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR. LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES WERE ALSO REQUIRED TO OUTLINE THEIR EXPENDITURES RELATED TO ADDRESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE CODED NINETEEN PANDEMIC AS WELL AS HOW THEY ARE INCREASING OR IMPROVING SERVICES. FOR OUR ENGLISH LEARNERS YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS PURSUANT TO THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA. AS I MENTIONED BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION AS WELL AS OUR STATE AGENCIES HAVE DONE QUITE A BIT TO HELP SCHOOLS NAVIGATE THIS DIFFICULT YEAR. WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR SCHOOLS TO IDENTIFY NEEDS AND BARRIERS TO SERVICES SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE SUPPORT AND ASSISTANCE IS NEEDED. IN ADDITION TO THESE REAL TIME EFFORTS WE ARE WORKING HARD ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. ACCURATE FINANCE. WHICH WILL REFLECT WHAT I BELIEVE OUR SHARED GOALS OF EDUCATIONAL EQUITY. COAL CHILD SUPPORT. ACADEMIC OPPORTUNITY AND THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF STUDENTS STAFF AND FAMILIES. Q. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE. OKAY THANK YOU. READY GO NOW TO STEPHANIE GREG SIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION I BELIEVE YOU ARE VIA TELEPHONE. YES GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MCCARTY AND MEMBERS OF THE UBCOMMITTEE CHIEF DEPUTY A PUBLIC INSTRUCTION STEPHANIE GREG THANKS THANK YOU FOR INVITING ME HERE TODAY TO DISCUSS HOW THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ARE SUPPORTING OUR SCHOOLS AND EDUCATORS AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE PLAN FOR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION. TO CLASSROOM BASED TEACHING AND LEARNING BY THE END OF THE LAST ACADEMIC YEAR IN THE EARLY MONTHS OF THE COVE IN NINETEEN PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THIS CD WORKED WITH OUR MANY PARTNERS AND STAKEHOLDERS TO DEVELOP STATEWIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE C. THREE OPENING OF SCHOOLS. AT THE TIME WE ALL WERE HOPEFUL THAT OUR STATE COULD REDUCE INFECTION RATES AT A LEVEL THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR THE SAFE RETURN TO CAMPUSES INSTEAD A SURGEON OUTBREAK FORCED EDUCATORS TO PIVOT TURNING OUR FOCUS TO STRENGTHENING DISTANCE LEARNING FOR ALL STUDENTS UNTIL WE FLATTEN THE CURVE IN OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. SINCE THEN THE CP HAD DISABILITY TO NUMEROUS MEETINGS BETWEEN EDUCATION LEADERS AND HEALTH OFFICIALS IN EVERY. TO FOSTER CONSISTENT COMMUNICATION AND UNDERSTANDING OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY DATA NEEDED TO RETURN TO IN PERSON LEARNING. THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ALSO UNVEILED A NEW COUNTY MONITORING SYSTEM FELT COOL TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHEN IT IS SAFER TO RE OPEN BASED ON COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RIGHT. AND WE AGAIN TURN OUR FOCUS IS SUPPORTING OUR SCHOOLS WITH THE SAFE RETURN TO CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION I THINK WE MUST TAKE TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE MONUMENTAL JOB OUR TEACHERS AND EDUCATIONAL LEADERS HAVE DONE IN THE FALL TO STRENGTHEN DISTANCE LEARNING AND GO ABOVE AND BEYOND TO REACH AND MAKE MEANINGFUL CONNECTIONS WITH THEIR STUDENTS. AND AS THIS PANDEMIC HAS EXPOSED AND EXACERBATED INEQUITIES THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY WE ALL AGREE THAT A RETURN TO INSTRUCTION PERSON CAN HELP US RECONNECT WITH OUR MOST INTERNAL BOTH STUDENTS ALREADY ON THE MARGINS. THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT FROM SOCIAL EMOTIONAL PERSPECTIVE I THIS PANDEMIC HAS INCREASED AND INTENSIFIED THE TRAUMA TOO MANY OF OUR STUDENTS. I KNOW HOW MUCH OUR EDUCATORS WANT AND NEED TO BE BACK AT SCHOOL WHEN THEIR STUDENTS WITH THEIR STUDENTS WHEN IT IS SAFE TO DO SO. THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT HAS BEEN CLEAR FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC THAT WE CAN ONLY DEVELOP A SUCCESSFUL PATHWAY TO RETURN TO SCHOOL CAMPUSES IF WE ARE GUIDED BY SAFETY AND SCIENCE FIRST AND FOREMOST THIS IS AN EXTRAORDINARILY COMPLEX UNDERTAKING THAT REQUIRES COLLABORATION A CALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA STAKEHOLDERS. ESPECIALLY AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT A VIRUS THAT PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS BELIEVE WILL BE WITH US WELL INTO TWENTY TWENTY ONE. I'VE CALIFORNIA MAKES STRIDES TO REDUCE CARBON NINETEEN INFECTIONS MOST OF THE COUNTIES ARE MOVING INTO THE RED OR LESS RESTRICTIVE TEARS UNDER THE STATE- PRESS. CLEARING THE WAY FOR MORE AND MORE SCHOOL DISTRICT AND COUNTIES CAN OPEN. HOWEVER IT HAS BECOME CLEAR THAT EVEN WHEN COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION RATES ARE LOWER A SCHOOL DISTRICT PREPAREDNESS FOR IN PERSON LEARNING IS IMPACTED. BY AVAILABLE RESOURCES TO INVEST IN NECESSARY MEASURES TO REMAIN OPEN SAFELY INCLUDING CAT CASTING PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES IMPROVEMENTS. FOR INVESTMENT. THE STATE HAS PROVIDED SCHOOLS WITH A TWO MONTH SUPPLY OF PP. BUT SCHOOLS MUST PREPARE TO REMAIN OPEN FOR THE DURATION OF A PANDEMIC AND WILL NEED MORE. TESTING FREQUENCY AT THE LOCAL DECISION BUT CURRENT CAPACITY ALLOWED VERY FEW SCHOOLS TO TEST EMPLOYEES MORE THAN ONCE A MONTH. IN MANY CASES AT ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS IN FACT IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST JUST CALLED FOR FREQUENT. PROACTIVE TESTING AS THE MISSING PIECE OF SCHOOL RE OPENING AND THE INCREASING RETAIN SCREENING USING RAPID CATHOLIC SCHOOLS SHOULD RANK AMONG OUR MOST URGENT. NATIONAL PRIORITIES. THE CURRENT FRAME ALLOW SCHOOL ABILITY. FOR THE COSTS. BUT DISTRICT HAVE EXTRA CONCERN THAT THEIR HEALTH PLAN PREMIUMS MAY INCREASE PERMANENTLY. IN THE MEANTIME WE KNOW THERE ARE MANY DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO REOPEN AT BEGUN DOING JEFF BACK IN ORANGE COUNTY IMPOSTER COUNTY FOR INSTANCE. THOUSANDS OF STUDENTS HAVE BEEN BACK TO SCHOOL IN MODIFIED OR HYBRID FORMS FOR WEEKS. MANY OTHER DISTRICTS SUCH AS THE LOCALLY THE FULL FROM CURRENT ORBIT CORDOVA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE TAKING A PHASED IN APPROACH BEGINNING WITH SMALL COHORT OF YOUNGER AGE STUDENTS WITH A FULL RETURN INCLUDING. HIGH SCHOOL IN JANUARY. ELSEWHERE MANY OTHER DISTRICTS HAVE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO CONTINUE WITH DISTANCE LEARNING AND TELEVISION YOU WARY TO GIVE THEM TIME TO WORK THROUGH FACILITY UPGRADES SAFETY INVESTMENT. TESTING PROTOCOLS IMPLANTS FOR ENSURING LEARNING CONTINUITY. DISTRICT IN COLLABORATION WITH LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS WILL ULTIMATELY DECIDE WHEN AND HOW TO BEST SERVE THEIR STUDENTS AND HOW TO DO SO SAFELY. IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE WORKED VERY HARD AND HVE BEEN SO CREATIVE IN FINDING SOLUTIONS FOR MOBILE TESTING VANS TO SCHOOL FIGHT FOR TEACHERS TO GET TESTED. TO PUTTING UP OUTDOOR TENTS SO STUDENTS CAN RECEIVE INSTRUCTION OUTDOORS. UNDERSTANDING THAT PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE AN IMPORTANT DRIVER OF THE HEALTH AND VITALITY OF LOCAL COMMUNITIES THE SUPERINTENDENT HOUSE PULLED LABOR GROUP. AND MAYOR'S OFFICE IS FROM SOME OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST CITIES TO SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND FIND WAYS HOW CITIES CAN WORK TOGETHER TO LEVERAGE FUNDS FOR C. FREE OPENING. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE TO FINALIZE THE TESTING PROTOCOL THEY CAN HELP MAINTAIN SAFETY IN A PUBLIC SCHOOL SETTING OVER THE LONG TERM. LAST THURSDAY THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT ALSO ANNOUNCED A PARTNERSHIP WITH GENERAL MOTORS IS COMMITTED TO DONATE FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND COST MATHIS CALIFORNIA'S UNITS. THE MASS DISTRIBUTION WILL BE PRIORITIZED TO COMMUNITIES SHOULD FAMILY A FARMWORKERS ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND TRIBAL COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY THE PANDEMIC. THIS VIDEO CARD. DISTRICT AND FINDING CREATIVE SOLUTIONS WITH SEEN MANY DISTRICTS. THE FIVE THREE DOLLAR A CARE THAT FUNDS FOR THIS PURPOSE MANY SCHOOLS PUT UP TEN TIME OF USE THE FUNDS PLASTIC GLASS PART. THAT MIGHT BE USED TO FUND FOR FISCAL RENTAL IN ORDER TO CREATE AN TO CREATE SMALLER CLASS SIZE. LOOKING AHEAD TO THE WEEKS A MONTH AHEAD. THERE ARE CONCRETE THINGS THE STATE CAN DO TO FACILITATE A SAFE AND SUSTAINABLE TRANSITION TO CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION. INCLUDING PROVIDE CLARITY AROUND TESTING PROTOCOLS AND FREQUENCIES BASED ON PUBLIC HEALTH RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONSIDERING LOCAL AREA. FIGHTING A FRAMEWORK FOR TESTING AND TREATING THAT DOES NOT ADDRESS ONGOING COST TO OUR LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. CONSISTENT TRACKING AND MONITORING STATEWIDE OF SCHOOL OUTBREAKS AND TRENDS SO THAT WE CAN LEARN AND ADAPT FROM THE EXPERIENCES ACROSS CALIFORNIA. WORK FOR THE CD'S ORGANIZATIONAL CAPACITY TO PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL LEARNING SUPPORT AND GUIDANCE TO EDUCATORS IN AREAS OF DISTANCE LEARNING HYBRID LEARNING MODELS EDUCATIONAL TECHNOLOGY SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING AND MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. THE STUDY SUPPLY OR REVENUE STREAM TO ACQUIRE THE NEEDED PP AND VISIBILITY IMPROVEMENTS TO KEEP CAMPUSES SAFE OVER THE LONG TERM. THERE ARE MANY UNKNOWNS IN THE WEEKS AND MONTHS AHEAD BUT I AM CERTAIN OF ONE THING THE RESILIENCY DETERMINATION AND PERSEVERANCE OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL LEADERS TO PUT OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR SAFETY FIRST AS WE WORK TOGETHER TO RETURN TO THE CLASSROOM WE HAVE ALL MISSED SO MUCH. IT IS OUR COLLECTIVE AND SHARED RESPONSIBILITY TO WORK TOGETHER AS WE ARE STRONGER TOGETHER THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND TODAY'S DIALOGUE. THANK YOU STEPHANIE. LAST FOR THIS SECTION WE'RE GOING TO GO TO. DOCTOR ERICA PAN THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH I BELIEVE WE HAVE YOU HERE IN THE CAPITAL. IN ROOM. ONE TWENTY SIX. GOOD MORNING CAN YOU ALL HEAR ME. YES WE CAN'T SEE YOU YET IS THERE YOU ARE OKAY. GOOD MORNING CHEN MEMBERS- I AS YOU JUST MENTIONED UNDER TO ACT UPON AND THE ACTING STATE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICER. I ALSO WANNA LET YOU KNOW I'M A PEDIATRIC INFECTIOUS DISEASE SPECIALIST AND THE PARENTS OF THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND NEAR AND DEAR TO MY HEART ISSUE. SO A LOT OF MY COLLEAGUES HAVE HAD A LOT OF IMPORTANT THINGS SO I'LL TRY TO AND JUST SKIP OVER THOSE AND PROVIDES MORE PUBLIC HEALTH DETAILS FOR YOU THIS MORNING. AS MENTIONED WE HAVE UNVEILED THEIR ADMINISTRATIONS UNVEILED THE BLUEPRINT FOR SAFER KANEMI AT THE END OF AUGUST. AND WITH THIS APPROACH WE HAVE MANAGED TO HAVE A SLOW AND STRINGENT RE OPENING. THE ALLOWED FOR A SAFE AND STABLE RE OPENING OF OUR STATE. AS MANY OTHERS HAVE MENTIONED WE'RE SEEING INCREASES AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD. AND WE MANAGED TO DO THIS SLOW INTERNET APPROACH. TO MAINTAIN STABILITY. SOME OF THE KEY PRINCIPLES JUST AGAIN TO HIGHLIGHT THIS WAS MENTIONED BRIEFLY BEFORE. WE HAVE FOUR DIFFERENT TIERS RATHER THAN JUST AN ON OFF. AND THOSE TEARS HAVE DIFFERENT LEVELS OF COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION. WE USE AT DIFFERENT METRICS WITH TO- MEASURE THOSE DIFFERENT TIERS. AND WE USE CASE RATES TEST POSITIVITY. AS WAYS OF LOOKING WHETHER THERE'S WIDESPREAD TRANSMISSION OR MINIMAL TRANSMISSION IN THE COMMUNITY. THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE WE WANTED TO EMPHASIZE FROM THE VERY BEGINNING WAS IT. ANY COUNTY AS IT SLOWLY REOPENS NEED TO BE IN A SPECIFIC TIER FOR AT LEAST THREE WEEKS. TO SEE STABILITY. BEFORE IT CAN MOVE FORWARD AND ALSO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE COUNTY NEEDS METRICS OF THE LESS RESTRICTIVE HERE. FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS BEFORE I CAN MOVE FORWARD TO THE NEXT YEAR WE ALSO MADE SURE THAT DURING THESE DIFFERENT TIERS IT WASN'T AGAIN JUST THAT CERTAIN BUSINESSES COULD BE OPEN OR CLOSED. WE GRADUALLY ALLOW MORE THINGS TO BE INDOORS VERSUS OUTDOORS AND WITHIN INDOOR SETTINGS ALLOWING MORE MORE CAPACITY FOR. THE TEARS AS PART OF OUR PRINCIPLES. WE ALSO ADDED A HEALTH EQUITY METRIC THAT WE- DEFINED- SEVERAL WEEKS AGO AND THIS IS RALLY AN IMPORTANT MENTOR TO ENSURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE MOST IMPACTED BY THIS PANDEMIC ARE DRESSED IN ORDER TO MOVE FORWARD AS A COUNTY. OTHERS ALSO BRIEFLY MENTIONED AS FAR AS SCHOOL RE OPENING. OF ONCE A COUNTY IS IN THE RED TIER FOR AT LEAST FOURTEEN DAYS SO AGAIN AN EXTRA LEVEL OF STABILITY AND NOT READ HERE- THAT IS WHEN SCHOOLS ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE RE OPEN AT ANY GIVEN COUNTY. AND YOU SAW AN UPDATE AS OF LAST WEEK AND I'D SAY AFTER TODAY'S WILL BE AT LEAST FORTY NINE COUNTIES. IN OUR STATE OF FIFTY EIGHT THEY'LL BE ELIGIBLE IN THE RED DEER. AND ALMOST TWO THIRDS OF OUR POPULATION WILL BE ABLE TO OPEN- AS FAR AS OUR BLUEPRINT AND YOUR TRADEMARK. I ALSO WANT TO EMPHASIZE A LOT HAS BEEN OF THE SIZE AROUND- WHAT ARE THE RESOURCES AND LOCAL. SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION. IT'S ALSO VERY IMPORTANT AS A FORMER LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIAL MYSELF. THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS THERE SIXTY ONE OF THEM AND CALIFORNIA. ARE ALL WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND ARE HELPING EACH OF THESE. SCHOOLS WITH THE REOPENING PLANS AND ASSISTANCE. AND ON THAT NOTE ALSO IS MENTIONED. AS PART OF OUR RE OPENING FRAMEWORK IN JULY. WELL WE SAID THAT SCHOOLS COULD BE ELIGIBLE TO OPEN FOR IN PERSON OR PERSONAL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION IN THE RED TERROR AFTER TWO WEEKS. THE SCHOOLS ARE STILL IN THE PURPLE TERROR. OR THE WIDESPREAD. COULD ALSO APPLY TO THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER FOR A WAIVER FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WOULD THEN GO THROUGH A SET OF CRITERIA AND APPROVE THOSE RE OPEN PLANS THAT THEY WERE SAFE AND THEY FELT COMFORTABLE WITH THE RESOURCES. IN THAT COMMUNITY AND CONSULT WITH. THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT BEFORE MOVING FORWARD. AS OF OCTOBER TWO. SIX WE HAVE OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LEADERS OF AND GRANTED ACROSS THE STATE. AND I ALSO WANTED TO NOTE SO ALL LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS ARE ALL PROVEN NINETEEN CASES ARE ACTUALLY REPORTABLE TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND IN OUR SCHOOL GUIDANCE THAT WE HAVE RELEASED AN UPDATED OVER TIME SCHOOLS ARE MANDATED TO REPORT TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AS WELL WE ARE ACTUALLY TRACKING THIS AND AS OF OCTOBER TWENTY FIFTH. WE ONLY RECORDED TWO SCHOOL RELATED TOPICS THAT HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO THE LOCAL DEPARTMENT AND REPORTED TO THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT THIS FALL FOR A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN CASES. AND AGAIN THERE'S UPDATED GUIDANCE THAT IS ONGOING WE ARE GOING TO- UPDATE AND EVEN MORE THOROUGH GUIDANCE FROM THE PRIOR JULY SEVENTEENTH KIND. BUT IT REALLY OUTLINES ALREADY WHAT TO DO WHEN THERE'S A CASE REPORTED IN THE SCHOOL I WANT TO DO WHEN THERE'S MULTIPLE CASES- AND IN THE UPCOMING ITEMS WERE ACTUALLY GONNA OUTLINED WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE SCHOOL WHAT IS THE ROLE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT. WHAT TO DO WHEN A SPECIFIC- COHORT IS POTENTIALLY EXPOSED AND WATER CRITERIA FOR CLOSING. WE ALSO AS MENTIONED EARLIER- ALLOWED FOR. CODING GUIDANCE THAT AUTHORIZES SMALL GROUP IN PERSON SERVICES AND CONTROLLED SUPERVISED IN INDOOR ENVIRONMENTS. SUCH AS THOSE OPERATED BY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. AND THAT'S AGAIN APPLIES TO SCHOOLS THAT CANNOT REOPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION INCLUDING ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS IN A JURISDICTION THAT I'VE NOT RECEIVED A LARGER SCHOOL WAIVER. AND IN THESE CASES WILL SCHOOL SETTINGS COHORTS ARE STABLE GROUPS OF STUDENTS WITH NO MORE THAN SIXTEEN INDIVIDUALS TYPICALLY IT'S AROUND WO ADULTS AND FOURTEEN CHILDREN- AND THE ELIGIBILITY IS- STUDENTS WERE MEETING FOR TARGETED SUPPORT AND INTERVENTION SERVICES. WELL THE SCHOOL IS CLOSED IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. IS SPECIALIZED SERVICES ARE DETERMINED BY THE ELEAZAR AND CAN INCLUDE OCCUPATIONAL THERAPY SERVICES SPEECH AND LANGUAGE SERVICES MEDICAL SERVICES. BEHAVIORAL SERVICES OR OTHER EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT SERVICES SUCH AS THOSE RELATED TO ENGLISH LEARNER STATUS OR INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS OR OTHER REQUIRED ASSESSMENTS. WE ALSO WANTED TO LET YOU KNOW AS FAR AS SCHOOL CLOSER RECOMMENDATIONS THIS WOULD BE AN UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCES. BUT THIS IS IN THE JULY SEVENTEENTH RE OPENING FRAMEWORK THAT COULD BE BASED ON THE PERCENTAGE OF TEACHERS OUR STUDENTS AND OUR STAFF THAT ARE POSITIVE FOR THE NINETEEN. OR IF THERE ARE MULTIPLE CASES AND LOCAL CO HARD A SCHOOL OR AT LEAST 5% OF THE TOTAL NUMBER OF TEACHERS STUDENTS THAT ARE. TESTED WITHIN A FOURTEEN DAY PERIOD. AND THAT'S 5% BENCHMARK GENERALLY INCLUDE THE DENOMINATOR OF BOTH. STUDENTS AND STAFF. LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AGAIN CAN ALWAYS DETERMINE SCHOOL CLOSURES MARKET FOR OTHER REASONS BASED ON THEIR LOCAL INVESTIGATION AND OTHER LOCAL EPIDEMIOLOGICAL DATA. IF A CONFIRM CODE NINETEEN INFECTION OCCURS IN A CLASS THE SCHOOL CAN IDENTIFY CONTACT AND PORTANTINO EXCLUDED CONTACTS WHICH MAY INCLUDE AN ENTIRE COHORT WHICH IS WHY IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. TO ENFORCE THE COHORT OF COHORTS OF CHILDREN THAT ARE NOT MIXING. EVEN WHEN SCHOOLS ARE OPEN FOR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. WE ALSO RECOMMEND TESTING OF CONTACTS AND PURCHASING SYMPTOMATIC CONTACTS THERE SHOULD ALSO BE DISINFECTION AND CLEANING OF KLOSTERMAN PRIMARY SPACES AND THE SCHOOL COULD POTENTIALLY REMAIN OPEN IF THERE IS NO ON MIXING OF COVERT. THERE'S ALSO ARCADE THAT EACH SCHOOL SITE SHOULD DESIGNATE A LIAISON A SCHOOL NURSE APPLICABLE OR OTHERS WHO CAN HELP COORDINATE MONITORING AND COMMUNICATIONS TO LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL HEALTH OFFICIALS. AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL COMMUNITY. LIAISON SHOULD MONITOR REPORT POSITIVE CASES AND CHECK WHETHER THE SCHOOL APPROACHES THE 5% THRESHOLD DURING A FOURTEEN DAY PERIOD. AS FAR AS CONTACT TRACING RESOURCES. ARE CALIFORNIA CONNECTED CONTACT RAISING PROGRAM ISBUILDING RESOURCES TO SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND THEIR SCHOOL PARTNERS. ARE CAL CONNECTED VIRTUAL AGENT CASE EVERY SERVICE HAS BEEN EXPANDED TO FACILITATE RAPID IDENTIFICATION OF SCHOOL RELATED EXPOSURE EVENTS. INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING- SCHOOL OUTBREAKS OR OTHER TEAMS. THE NEW SURVEY WILL BE AVAILABLE ACTUALLY BEGINNING THIS WEEK. I'VE ALSO BUILT A USER FRIENDLY PORTAL THAT WILL LAW SCHOOL AND DISTRICT STAFF TO SHARE COURT INFORMATION ABOUT SCHOOL AFFILIATED CASES AND EXPOSE CONTACTS WITH THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN REAL TIME. THIS PORTAL WILL BE GOING LIVE ON NOVEMBER FIFTH. BUT ALSO EXTENSIVE. RESOURCES AND SUPPORT BY THE CONTACT TRACING TRAINING COURSE SPECIFICALLY FOR SCHOOL PARTNERS AND OTHER LOCAL COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS. AND THIS IS BEING OFFERED THROUGH OUR UCSF AND UCLA PARTNERS AS PART OF A CO THE NINETEEN VIRTUAL TRAINING ACADEMY. WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING NEW OPERATING DISTRIBUTION COURSES FOR EXPERIENCE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT STAFF WHICH INCLUDES SKILL BUILDING TRAINING SPECIFIC TO MANAGING SCHOOL OUTBREAKS. AND FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS NEEDING ANY DIRECT SUPPORT WAS SCHOOL OPERATES WE ARE DEVELOPING STRIKE TEAMS OF SKILLED DISEASE INVESTIGATORS WHO CAN BE CALLED ON TO ASSIST OR BUILDING OUT A ROVING TEAM OF STATE REDIRECTED CONTRACTORS. WHO CAN SUPPORT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS WITH CONTACT UNIFICATION RELATED TO SCHOOL AFFILIATED OUTBREAKS EXPOSURE. I TESTING TASK FORCE IS ALSO INCLUDED SCHOOL TESTING IN A STRATEGIC PLAN INCLUDING TESTING NEEDS ESTIMATES FOR SCHOOLS. ADDITIONALLY THE TESTING TASK FORCES CONTRIBUTED DISCUSSIONS WITH THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ABOUT SCHOOL TESTING GUIDANCE. THIS IS AN EVER EVOLVING. FIELD AND WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE ONE IN FRANCE AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR PARTNERS. GREATNESS WE'RE ORGANIZING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND SCHOOLS TO ENSURE THE UTILIZATION OF OUR STATE LABS THAT IS- OPENING AS WE SPEAK TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS FOR TESTING ACCESS CAPACITY. EQUITY AND PERSISTENT ABILITY. AND SCHOOLS ARE ALREADY INCLUDED IN THE INITIAL ROLLOUT OF THE STATE LAB PRIORITIES. THE CONFLICT BUT THE WORK OF THE TESTING TASK FORCE THE ADMINISTRATION ALONG WITH OUR STATE BOARD OF THAT AND FROM EDUCATION THANK AGING A WORKING GROUP OF PRACTITIONERS. BOTH FROM LABOR AND MANAGEMENT. AND THE GOAL OF OUR WORKING GROUP'S RECEIVE INPUT THAT WILL MINIMIZE BARRIERS TO BUILDING TESTING STRATEGIES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FOR SCHOOLS. SO IN CLOSING I WOULD JUST HIGHLIGHT THAT SCHOOLS ABSOLUTELY. SHOULD RE OPEN- AND GRADUALLY WHEN ALLOWED WE WANT TO BALANCE THE RISKS OF TRANSMISSION IN THE SCHOOL SETTING WITH THE REST OF LOSS OF LEARNING AND THE STRUCTURE FOR. CHILDREN IN PERSON LEARNING. THEIR EXAMPLES AROUND THE WORLD AND AROUND THE COUNTRY OF SUCCESSFUL SCHOOL RE OPENING WHEN YOU FOLLOW THE KEY PRINCIPLES OF DISTANCING FACE COVERINGS. MAINTAINING COVERTS AND GIVEN ELATION. AND AGAIN WE HAVE ONGOING AN ONGOING UPDATE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOLS AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. AND AGAIN I MENTIONED THAT SCHOOLS- PRACTICALLY TWO THIRDS OF OUR POPULATION IS ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE TO REOPEN SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE HAVE A LARGE PROPORTION OF OUR STATE AND ABSOLUTELY OPEN. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO ENGAGING AND- WHAT IS NEEDED TO CONTINUE TO ENCOURAGE THE REOPENING OF THE SCHOOLS. THANK YOU ARE. THANK YOU OKAY I KNOW IF WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU SPECIFICALLY TO STAY PUT IN SO THIS OF COURSE WAS THE FIRST FOUR FROM THAT THE STATE REALLY PERSPECTIVE AND WE'RE GONNA GET TO. SOME OF THE LOCALS AN EVENT I KNOW I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS FOR EACH OF YOU I KNOW OUR MEMBERS HERE HAVE A LOT SO THAT I THINK IS GOING TO BE A LOT OF ENGAGEMENT RIGHT NOW. I'LL JUST START OUT WITH WITH ONE QUESTION FOR EACH OF YOU AND I WILL GO TO THE OTHERS I MAY COME BACK UP THE FIRST QUESTION FOR THE WILL GO BACK. TO L. A. L. ANY BACK ON. I REQUEST FOR AMY LEE. YES YES YES CHAIR RIGHT YES SO I WAS. FIRST WE'RE ALL INTERESTED IN WHAT POTENTIAL STATE ACTIONS- THERE THERE COULD BE ON RE OPENING SO WHEN YOU OUTLINES YOUR IDEAS AND PAGE FIVE ARE ARE ARE THEY REALLY PUBLIC POLICIES AND PROCEDURES FOR US OR IS IT RESOURCES IN OTHER WORDS WHAT WHAT THE ISSUE IS WHEN THESE DISTRICTS ARE DOING THIS NOW OR WILL DO IT. IS IT MONEY THEY NEED TO DO SOME OF THESE THINGS IS THAT OR IS IT MORE- GUIDANCE AND CLARIFICATION AND EFFORTS THAT WE CAN DO FROM THE STATE TO ASSESS THEM. I THINK DEPENDING ON WHICH SPECIFIC ACTION YOU'RE LOOKING AT IT MIGHT BE A COMBINATION OF ALL OF THOSE SO FOR THEM SOME OF THESE- POTENTIAL ACTIONS THEY ARE MORE RESOURCE HEAVY- THEY MIGHT INVOLVE SENDING A STATE STAFF TO SCHOOLS ARE WORKING WITH SCHOOLS MORE CLOSELY. FOR SOME OF THEM LIKE COULD BE TESTING THAT MIGHT ENTAIL MORE- THE FUNDING. AND SO IT DOES LARGELY VERY. OKAY SO THIS IS GOING TO BE MY BECAUSE FOLLOW UP WITH DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE SECOND BUT FOR YOU. OF COURSE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE THE BUDGET YEAR- WE'RE NOT QUITE HALFWAY DONE. THROUGH THE BUDGET WE WON'T GO BACK AND EDIT THE DOCTOR NEXT BUDGETS WILL NEXT JUNE AND THIS ALL HAPPENING TODAY TOMORROW THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. SO WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STATE SHOULD BE DOING AND THINKING ABOUT THIS WHETHER OR NOT. IT'S MONEY WE CURRENTLY HAVE HERE WE ACTUALLY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF YOU KNOW THE YOU KNOW WE'LL GET TO IN A LITTLE BIT. OF POTENTIAL SECOND ROUND OF FEDERAL MONEY DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO HAVE YOU KNOW- ADJUSTMENT IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO MAKE SURE SCHOOLS. HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. OR. WHAT OTHER STEPS WOULD WE TAKE. AND LET ME ACTUALLY SEND THAT TO MY COLLEAGUE. EDGAR CABRAL. OKAY SO IS HERE. YES I'M HERE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES YES- EVER BROUGHT WITH THEM IS THAT OUR FOCUS YEAH I DON'T THINK WE HAVE IN PREPARING THESE OPTIONS WE KIND OF JUST LAID OUT A FEW OFTHE OPTIONS THAT WE- THOUGHT WE'RE THANKS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER I DO THINK IN ANY OF THESE CASES NONE OF THESE THINGS ARE NECESSARILY QUICK CAN BE DONE QUICKLY SO- ANY OF THE THINGS WOULD REQUIRE TIME AND EFFORT SO FIRST. IN TERMS OF PROVIDING MORE SUPPORT FROM STATE- CDPH YOU WOULD NEED TO GET THE STAFF NECESSARY TO GO DOWN AND PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT AND FOR EXAMPLE TRAIN THEM TO BE READY TO DO THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING LIKE TESTING IT TAKES SOME TIME TO ONE FIGURE OUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THEN- BE ABLE TO- DEVELOP PARTNERSHIPS WITH OTHER ENTITIES SO NONE OF THE THINGS WE'VE NOT SORT OF THING CAN BE DONE VERY QUICKLY RIGHT NOW WITHIN SAY THE NEXT. MONTH OR TWO SO THAT'S OF THESE COULD BE PART OF THAT THEY JANUARY BUDGET CONVERSATION AS WE HAVE A BETTER SENSE OF WHAT THE REVENUE. SITUATION LOOKS LIKE. OKAY THANK YOU LET ME KINDA GO TO THE PROM TO FIND AND THAT THAT SIM QUESTION. CAN WE GET JESSICA. YES HERE WITH US OKAY SO. WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT IF ANYTHING AS WE'RE HEARING FROM THOUSAND DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF RE OPENING AND I AND WE DID OF COURSE AS YOU KNOW IT PUT THE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY IN THE CURRENT YEAR BUDGET. FOR IN THE ONE TIME POT TO- TO HELP DISTRICTS WITH THESE DISTANCE LEARNING NEEDS AND AS WELL AS POTENTIAL RE OPENING. YOU KNOW DO YOU THINK THEY HAVE WHAT THEY NEED. AND POTENTIALLY YOU KNOW IF WE HAVE A CHANCE DO YOU THINK THAT WE WOULD WANT TO LOOK AT. DOING SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN THE- IN THE BUDGET YEAR THE CURRENT YEAR NOT THE BUDGET EXCUSE ME IN THE CURRENT YEAR. TO HELP DISTRICTS OUT THERE TODAY. SO THIS JUST% COMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND YOU ASK A QUESTION THAT- IS IT I THINK THE ANSWER IS CONSTANTLY EVOLVING AS WE AS THE PANDEMIC PROGRESSES AND WE LEARN MORE ABOUT THE NEEDS OUT AND IN THE FIELD. I WOULD SAY THAT OUR BEST DATA POINT FOR THE FISCAL NEEDS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS- IS THE DATA THAT WE'RE COLLECTING CURRENTLY ON THE EXPENDITURE OF THE FIVE POINT THREE BILLION- FUNDS THAT WENT OUT- AND THAT'S A MIXTURE OF FEDERAL FUNDS AS WELL AS- SOME GENERAL FUND. THE MAJORITY OF THAT FUNDING IS FEDERAL CORONAVIRUS REALLY FUN ABOUT FOUR POINT BILLION OF IT. AND THAT NEEDS TO BE EXPANDED BY DECEMBER THIRTIETH THIS YEAR THAT'S PURSUANT TO FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS AND SO THE STATE HAS BEEN. TRACKING VERY CAREFULLY THE EXPENDITURE OF THAT FUNDS BY LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES AND AT THIS POINT. STATEWIDE WE HAVE BEEN ABLE TO TRACK A LITTLE BIT LESS OR APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THOSE FUNDS BEING EXPENDED. CERTAINLY WE HAVE TWO MORE MONTHS LEFT TO THE DECEMBER THIRTIETH DEADLINE BUT- IT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT THAT MONEY HAS RUN SHORT YET. SO WE'RE CURRENTLY TRACKING THAT RESOURCE WISE IT FISCALLY RESOURCE WISE WE BELIEVE THAT SCHOOLS HAVE- WHAT THEY NEED ON A MACRO LEVEL. AGAIN IT'S HARD TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION AS THE SITUATION CONTINUES TO CHANGE WE LEARN. NEW INFORMATION EVERY DAY BUT WE ARE TRYING TO TRACK THE FISCAL HEALTH OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS VERY CAREFULLY I THINK. I'M IN OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH CBO'S GOOD CHIEF BUSINESS pI'VE HEARD LESS OF A CONCERN ABOUT THE CURRENT YEAR FUNDING IN MORE OF A CONCERN ABOUT THE ON GOING FUNDING GIVEN TO CHECK POTENTIAL LONG TERM CHANGES IN ENROLLMENT- SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'VE BEEN HEARING. YEAH WELL I GUESS THE OBSERVATION FOR ME IS THAT WE DON'T HAVE A LOT THE HUGE NUMBER OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE FULLY RE OPENED WE HAVE SOME. AND THE ONES ARE MENTIONED EARLIER. THIS AROUND MY AREA HERE IN THE REGION IN SACRAMENTO THE SMALLER DISTRICTS THE OUT LIARS. SO AS YOU GET THE LARGER DISTRICTS LIKE. THEY'LL GROW JUST ANNOUNCED IN SAC CITY IN SAN JUAN THE TO HAVE PROFIT FIFTY PLUS THOUSAND AND COURSE ARE NOT LIKE SAN DIEGO DELEO STATE- YOU KNOW. WE NEED TO MAKE THE COULD GO REALLY WRONG REALLY FAST AND SO. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T HAVE AN HOOPS LIKE SIX MONTHS DOWN THE LINE AND SO WE HAVE RESOURCES NOW SO. I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE READY AND IF THAT MEANS DOING A CURRENT YEAR ADJUSTMENTS AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T KNOW A LOT OF. MONEY HERE BUT POTENTIALLY WILL HAVE. A NEW OPPORTUNITY FOR FEDERAL CODED TWO POINT NO- STATE ALLOCATION IN THE COMING WEEKS WITH THE ELECTION COMING UP. SO THAT IS A REALITY ONE WE SHOULD THINK ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE ASKING FOR FROM CALIFORNIA IF THAT. IF THAT MATERIALIZES INTO WHAT WE COULD DO TO HELP DISTRICTS RIGHT AWAY. DEALING WITH THE NEEDS OF OTHER PEOPLE HERE THIRD CONTACT TRACING. TESTING RESOURCES FOR VAX VACCINES FOR ITS STUDENTS IN FACT AND STAFF AND THE TEACHERS AND SO FORTH. SO THAT'S JUST TO PUT ON A HORIZON- I WANTED TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS NOW FOR OUR DEPARTMENT. OF HEALTH PERSONNEL THAT THE OTHER MEMBERS- ENGAGE. JUST WANT TO ASK A DOCTOR PAN IS DOWN THERE AND. ONE TWENTY SEVEN. ABOUT BUT TO A CAN GET. HER CHICKEN HEAR. OKAY SO DR PANDA MY QUESTIONS FOR YOU ARE THAT. WE HAVE SOME DISTRICTS SO FAR DOING THIS LIGHT ROUTE NOT LIGHT REAL OPENING BUT AS FAR AS A TOTAL NUMBER OF CALIFORNIANS IT'S LIKE. WHAT TYPE OF TRENDS OUR OBSERVATIONS OR FEEDBACK HAVE WE GOTTEN AS FAR AS HOW IT'S GONE WITH THIS HYBRID LEARNING WITH THE- NOT FULL IN PERSON BUT- YEAH- ADJUSTED IN PERSON. WELL RESPOND WITH A COUPLE COMMENTS I THINK IN GENERAL IT MAKES ABSOLUTE PUBLIC HEALTH SENSE TO DO THIS IN A PHASE WAY AND A GRADUAL RE OPENING SO IT MAKES SENSE TO DO HYBRID IN THE BEGINNING WORK. SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND SCHOOLS ARE FACING IN THEIR YOUNGEST CHILDREN FIRST AND THAT WAS SORT OF THE IDEA BEHIND THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL LABOR AS WELL. WE WENT WE KNOW BOTH THAT THE YOUNGER CHILDREN. ARE THE LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE A SERIOUS INFECTION LEAST LIKELY TO CARRY INFECTION- SO THOSE ARE AND ALSO OF COURSE THE MOST- OFTEN THE MOST DIFFICULT TO HAVE DISTANCE LEARNING- AND AS I MENTIONED YOU KNOW ALL COOKIES IS A REPORTABLE- WE ARE TRACKING AND- YOU KNOW ANY SCHOOL OUTBREAKS HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO US IN ONLY TWO TO DATE HAVE BEEN REPORTED TO US AT THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT FROM OUR LOCAL DEPARTMENT COLLEAGUES. I'M AND CAN ONLY A TOTAL OF SEVENTEEN CASES SO THAT'S VERY ENCOURAGING CONSIDERING THE. NUMBER OF SCHOOLS THAT HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO RE OPEN. AND THEN AS FAR AS- WE HAPPENS WHEN THERE IS BECAUSE INEVITABLY THERE WILL BE. SOME KIDS OR TEACHERS TESTING POSITIVE DO WE HAVE ANY ANY GUIDELINES. AS AS AN EXAMPLE HERE IN ELK GROVE AND LOCALLY THIS IS THE FIRST DISTRICT I SHUT DOWN IN CALIFORNIA IT'S A MASSIVE DISTRICTS PROBABLY FIFTEEN TWENTY MILES WIDE. LITERALLY THERE WERE TWO HIGH SCHOOL KIDS ON THE FARM OF THE DISTRICT THEY WERE FIFTEEN MILES AWAY FROM. MAJORITY OTHER SCHOOLS WHO TESTED POSITIVE IN ENTIRE DISTRICT SHUT DOWN GRANTED THIS WAS EARLY MARCH WE DIDN'T KNOW. THE MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WAS HAPPENING WITH THIS ISSUE SO I THINK YOU KNOW WOULD WE LEARN AS FAR AS HOW THIS GOES SO. WHAT TYPE OF ADVICE ARE WE GIVING AS FAR AS- WHAT THE POLICIES WOULD BE FOR SCHOOLS AND CLASSROOMS AND HOW IT WOULD IMPACT. THE ACTUAL SCHOOL SIRE THE DIFFERENT DECENT SCHOOLS. SURE AGAIN CURRENTLY THE GUIDANCE- FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CASE IS TO OF COURSE NOTIFY. THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT WORK THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND DO CONTACT TRACING. AND DETERMINE WHO IS ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY BEEN EXPOSED DURING THE CASES INFECTIOUS PERIOD. SO THAT VERY WELL MAY INCLUDE AN ENTIRE COHORT AND THIS IS WHY THE PRINCIPLES ABOUT NOT MIXING COLORS AND HAVING STABLE CARDS ARE VERY IMPORTANT. IF YOU KNOW EXACTLY WHO THE STAFF OR STUDENT HAS HAD CONTACT WITH AND THE TWO DAYS PRIOR TO INFECTION AS IN THE LAST. DAYS PRIOR TO BEING ON THE SCHOOL CAMPUS. THEN YOU CAN- QUARANTINE THOSE INDIVIDUALS YOU CAN TEST THEM FIRST AND ESPECIALLY ANYBODY IS SYMPTOMATIC AND THEN QUARANTINE ANYBODY HAS BEEN EXPOSED. AND THEN YOU DON'T NEED TO EXCLUDE ANYONE ELSE FROM THE SCHOOL CAMPUS AND NOT MONITOR VERY CLOSELY. AND AGAIN OUR- OF CURRENT GUIDANCE SAYS THAT YOU KNOW YOU YOU WOULDN'T REALLY CONSIDER CLOSING AN ENTIRE SCHOOL. UNTIL YOU HAD MULTIPLE CASES AND PROBE. OR MORE THAN YOU KNOW REALLY THAT WOULD BE A MORE UNUSUAL CIRCUMSTANCE AND AGAIN WHAT WE HAVE SEEN BOTH- IN THE STATE AND OTHER YOU KNOW OTHER SITUATIONS AS SOMETIMES YOU'LL SEE. YOU KNOW WHEN THERE IS COMMUNITY TRANSMISSION ON THE HIGHER LEVELS OF CAN HENDERSON YOU'RE GONNA SEE. THAT THE TIMES REFLECTED AND STUFF OR STUDENTS BUT IF YOU QUICKLY ISOLATE THEM YOU'D HAVE TO CONTACT QUARANTINE THE CONTACT YOU CAN. ABSOLUTELY PREVENT FURTHER INFECTIONS. THANK YOU I THINK THAT'S HELPFUL AND OF COURSE THE YOU KNOW THE RIGHT COURSE OF ACTION- NOW WE'LL GET TO OTHER MEMBERS ARE START WITH ASSEMBLY. MEMBER CONSULT. FROM LOOKING. AT WHAT WE WILL NEED I HAVE A BIT OF A HERE BECAUSE ALTHOUGH GOT NUMBER TO BEGIN OF HOW MANY COUNTIES COULD CHILDREN LIVED AND HOW MANY COUNTIES THAT COULD REOPEN WE HAVE NO IDEA HOW MANY SCHOOLS IN THE STATE ARE OPEN DAILY. OR SCHOOL DISTRICTS DOES ANYBODY HAVE THAT DATA. LIKE RIGHT NOW SO% WHAT WE'RE SAYING. THERE BEEN SEVENTEEN OPERATE. OUT OF. DO WE KNOW HOW MANY SCHOOLS SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I WILL START AND THEN I DON'T OVER CD COLORS MAY WANNA SAY MORE I KNOW THERE'S BEEN SOM SURVEYS THAT HAVE BEEN DONE- AND RECENT SURVEYS I DID MENTION THAT OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED AND SIXTY WAIVERS HAVE BEEN GRANTED FOR ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS YOU KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL SCHOOLS. OVER ELEVEN HUNDRED OUR SCHOOLS HAVE BEEN. GRANTED WAIVERS ACROSS THE STATE AND THEN AS YOU'RE MENTIONING I THINK THERE ARE OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE RED OR LOWER TIERS THAT HAVE BEGIN TO RE OPEN AS WELL AND THERE IS SOME DATA FROM A RECENT SURVEY THAT I BELIEVE- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES HERE MAY HAVE INFORMATION ABOUT. WHAT THE SCHOOLS THEMSELVES OR THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS NO NOBODY'S MANDATED TO REPORT A CHARTER SCHOOL A PRIVATE SCHOOL SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT'S OPENING THERE'S NO. REQUIREMENT TO WE CAN DO A SURVEY. BUT WE DON'T REALLY KNOW CORRECT. HEY GREG SENT FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. AS WE THERE IS NO REQUIREMENT TO QUEUE FOR DISTRICTS CAN NOTIFY THEIR OPENING PLANS. TO THE STATE. WE DO HOWEVER KNOW WITH OUR TOP TWENTY FIVE DISTRICT THAT REPRESENT DISTRICTS THAT REPRESENTS ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION. OF OUR STUDENTS ARE ALMOST ONE THIRD OF STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA. MANY OF THEM ARE NOT OPENING UNTIL JANUARY THERE ARE A FEW THAT ARE A FEW THAT ARE DOING A PHASED IN. THE OPENING STARTING IN OCTOBER DEPENDING ON THEIR COUNTY THAT THEY'RE IN. AND SO THEY WILL BE FREEZING IN FROM ELEMENTARY TO HIGH SCHOOL AND THEN BY JANUARY ALL OF THEIR STUDENTS WILL BE BACK IN CLASSROOM BASED INSTRUCTION. WE DO HAVE KNOW THAT SOME OF THEM ARE LIKE OUR LARGER ONE DALY UNIFIED CANDY AGAIN UNIFIED. AND FRESNO ARE DOING SMALL COHORT FOR THEIR OPENING AT CURRENTLY. AS THEY LOOK TO DO. IT BASED IN RE OPENING. OKAY I KNOW WE PASS BUT MY COLLEAGUE HAD A BILL ACTUALLY THAT WE PASS BUT GOT HELD UP THAT WOULD HAVE ACTUALLY REQUIRED SCHOOLS TO REPORT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO REOPEN BECAUSE I THINK WHEN WE'RE WORKING WITH A NUMBER LIKE SEVENTEEN WELL THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT WE DON'T KNOW SEVENTEEN OUT OF HOW MANY- IT IT'S- DATA BECOMES USELESS IF WE CAN'TPUT AN END TO SOME COMPARISON- MY OTHER QUESTION IS WHERE IS THIS DATA ON SCHOOL REPORTS OF- CASES LIKE WHERE CAN WE FIND IT. OR IS THIS JUST WHAT WE'VE HEARD ABOUT AT THE STATE LEVEL THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE REPORTED OUTBREAKS AT SCHOOL HOW DO WE KNOW. THE CURRENTLY WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH THIS IS WITHIN OUR SURVEILLANCE DATA WE WILL BE LOOKING AT- HOW WE CAN. WORK WITH A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE MORE INFORMATION AVAILABLE ABOUT THIS OKAY SO IT'S NOT THIS IS ALL RIGHT. WELL I HAVE ONE I HAVE A TON OF QUESTIONS AND I'M SORRY- SO IN THE BEGINNING THE L. A. GAVE US A SAMPLE OF. STATE LOCAL COUNTY LEVEL GUIDANCE- THAT. MIGHT CONFLICT WITH ONE ANOTHER. DO WE HAVE THAT IN ITS GUIDANCE RIGHT BECAUSE NOBODY IS ACTUALLY- CHECKING TO MAKE SURE THE SCHOOLS ARE DOING IN. THIS GUIDANCE IT'S NOT LIKE. COUNTY HEALTH OFFICERS OR ARE THEY SUPPOSED TO BE THIS IS THAT A QUESTION THAT'S COMING UP IN MY COUNTY RIGHT NOW SO- THERE'S GUIDANCE. MAYBE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT CAN FOLLOW THE GUIDANCE MAYBE IT'S NOT PRACTICAL I THINK THAT WAS THE WORD THAT WAS BEING THROWN AROUND- DO WE HAVE LIKE AN ULTIMATE GUIDANCE HERE BETWEEN THE- COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION THE CD AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. FOR SCHOOLS. IS THERE LIKE A FINAL GUIDANCE. ARE YOU DIRECTING IT TO I ALREADY FOR MY HEALTH YES WELL THE L. A. KIND OF LAID IT OUT SO I DON'T KNOW IF THEY ARE ARE SUGGESTING THAT THERE WERE THINGS CONFLICT WE'RE NOT SURE. WHAT THE WHAT WHAT THE SCHOOLS ARE SUPPOSED TO BE DOING. SO BEFORE YOU ANSWER THAT EXHIBIT TECHNICAL THING SO IF ANYBODY WANTS TO ANSWER DO WE NEED TO TELL YOU WHO ARE LOOKING FOR OR CAN ANYBODY JUMP IN AND TALK. SO. IT IS VERY BROAD I BELIEVE ANY OF US CAN JUMP IN AND TALK I THINK I THINK WELL JUST MAKING SURE WE KNOW WITH THE APPROPRIATE PERSON I THINK ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE I WOULD. I WOULD SAY SOME OF THE THERE ARE SOME ASPECTS OF THE CDPH GUIDANCE THAT IS REQUIRED I BELIEVE LIKE THE MASK. REQUIREMENT FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS. AN ABSOLUTE REQUIREMENT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THERE MIGHT BE ANOTHER THAT I CAN'T REMEMBER BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE DETAILS ABOUT HOW YOU IMPLEMENT. THAT THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THIS IS. IT THESE ARE THINGS GOING TO CONSIDER TO TRY TO IMPLEMENT TO THE DEGREE POSSIBLE TO DOESN'T MEAN THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO DO IT. THAT'S THAT'S WHERE MOST OF THE MAJOR DECISIONS ARE ASIDE FROM THE MATHIS YOU. GREAT AND THEN MY FINAL QUESTION FOR NOW I DON'T THINK YOU AND I THINK THIS IS FOR DOCTOR PAN BECAUSE THE- DISCUSSION ABOUT COHORTS WAS REALLY. EXCITING AND INTERESTING. ALTHOUGH I KNOW IT'S JUST A VERY RECENT OUTBREAK- IF IT'S TO UNIFIED IT'S CLEAR THAT THE- OLDER KIDS THEY SUPPOSED TO BE REQUIRED TO BE IN COHORTS BECAUSE I KNOW- WITH SO FAR THAT THEY'VE HAD I THINK FOUR. POSITIVE TESTS IN THE LAST WEEK TWO OF THEM HAVE REQUIRED THEM TO- CORTINA HUNDRED FIFTY KIDS SO CLEARLY- THIS IDEA OF A SEVENTEEN PERCENT. CORE HORROR ARE FIFTEEN FOURTEEN TWO. TEACHERS IS THAT JUST FOR THE WAIVERS FOR THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOLS OR IS THAT SUPPOSED TO BE FOR- THE COUNTIES THAT ARE IN RED WHOSE HIGH SCHOOLS. AND MIDDLE SCHOOLS ARE OPENING UP. I THINK DOCTOR SHOULD. YES CAN YOU ME AHA. OKAY GREAT SO THE KIND OF WILL ANSWER OF YOUR- I SO. OLD AGAIN THE LOCAL UNFORTUNATE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCY AND THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AT A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS HAVE THE ULTIMATE AUTHORITY AROUND THESE THINGS. AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF. YOU KNOW IN IN THE IN THE TIMES TO TRY TO BE AS FLEXIBLE AS POSSIBLE TO HAVE GUIDING PRINCIPLES OF THE GETTING PEOPLE BEGAN ARE AROUND FACE COVERING SO. AS WAS MENTIONED THAT IS A STATE MANDATE THAT FACE COVERINGS MUST BE WORN FOR EVERYONE THIRD GRADE AN OLDER. AND THEN STRONGLY RECOMMENDED FOR KINDERGARTEN THROUGH SECOND GRADE AS WELL. AND THEN THE PHYSICAL DISTANCING SO AGAIN BUT I'M TRYING TO BE AS PRACTICAL AS POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE. YOU KNOW EVERY SCHOOL IS DIFFERENT AND THE SPACE IS DIFFERENT AND THE SIZE THEY'RE DIFFERENT SO. THE AND TO ANSWER YOUR QUESTION ABOUT THE COURT NUMBERS SO THE COURT NUMBERS- ARE REALLY FOR OUR SCHOOLS THAT HAVE NOT YET RETURNED TO FULL TO EVEN PARTIAL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION. TO ALLOW FOR THOSE HIGH NEEDS CHILDREN. OR CHILDREN HAVE SPECIAL NEEDS TO START TO COME BACK. I THINK ONCE YOU GET INTO EVEN THE HYBRID OR PARTIAL IN PERSON INSTRUCTION YOU WE WANTED. TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY AND LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS HAVE ECHOED AND AGAIN I HAVING BEEN A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR SOME MYSELF IT IS REALLY HELPFUL FOR EACH LOCAL DISTRICT. AND LOCAL SCHOOL TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO TRY TO DETERMINE HOW CAN THEY BEST SET UP THEIR CLASSROOMS. TO PHYSICALLY DOESN'T THE CHILDREN TO ALLOW FOR COHORTS AND ALLOW FOR STAFFING AND SAFE WAY- SO IT IS. AGAIN THESE GUIDING PRINCIPLES ARE THE SAME ACROSS ALL THESE DIFFERENT GUIDANCES BUT- TRYING TO ALLOW FOR THAT BALANCE WE'RE ALL TRYING TO BALANCE I THINK THE- THE POTENTIAL FOR. A TRANSMISSION AND PREVENTING TRANSMISSION IN THAT SETTING BUT ALSO. YOU KNOW HOW TO HAVE THE BEST ACTUAL INSTRUCTION. FOR CHILDREN IN THESE IN PERSON SETTINGS. SO I DON'T. THINK FAN JUST ADD IN A ROW THE CALIFORNIA. OF A- GUIDANCE GUIDING WITH BASED ON. THAT PRINT. PUBLISHED BY THE PDP. AND THEN ALL OF. ARE FOR WAS. AROUND THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT. FOR AN INSTRUCTIONAL MODELS. THAT ARE DISTRICTS WOULD BE LOOKING AT AS THEY LOOK TO RE OPEN. AND SO OUR FOCUS WAS MAINLY ON THE EDUCATIONAL COMPONENT OF RE OPENING. THANK YOU AND I JUST DR PAN AGAIN JUST BECAUSE I'M A LITTLE CONFUSED BY ALL THIS AND WHAT'S GOING ON ACTUALLY IN MY COUNTY- IT IS THE COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE POLICING THE SCHOOLS. IF YOU WILL I GUESS THAT'S NOT A GREAT WORD BUT. WELL I'D SAY AT AN EXTREME THE LOCAL HELD HER IN A COUNTY HEALTH OFFICER OR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE CITIES HELLO THIRTY TO CLOSE THE SCHOOL AND CERTAINLY HAVE AUTHORITY TO- TO ENFORCE LOCAL HOLD ON THIS ORDER IS THAT HAVE YOU KNOW COURSES YOU KNOW HAVE A HUGE SPECTRUM SO. I THINK THE ABILITY TO PHYSICALLY ENFORCER PHYSICALLY THE ON SITE IS NOT FEASIBLE FOR LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE THEY'RE ALSO DEALING WITH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT SECTORS- BUT BUT CERTAINLY YOU KNOW ENFORCEMENT IS AN ISSUE IN MANY SECTORS INCLUDING SCHOOLS AND WE'VE DEFINITELY BEEN HEARING ABOUT SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT FOLLOWING THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR STATE HEALTH GUIDELINES. THANK YOU MY LAST QUESTION I PROMISE IS IF THERE SHOULD BECOME A VACCINE IS THEIR THOUGHT PROCESS AS FAR AS- THE BUDGET AND- ANY BILL WOULD HAVE TO BE APPROPRIATED ON- INSURING THE CHILDREN WERE VACCINATED PRIOR TO- RETURNING TO SCHOOL. ANY THOUGHTS ONCE THERE'S A VACCINE HAVE WE STARTED TO THINK ABOUT THE. I THINK IT WOULD BE CHEAPER THAN THE- TESTING EVERY. HE WEEK SERVICE IS DOCTOR PUN AND IF YOU CAN STILL HEAR ME I WOULD SAY IN GENERAL MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS FOR ALL AGES A VACCINE IS SORT OF YOU KNOW THE SAYING THAT WE ARE NOT GOING TO BE CHARGING PEOPLE FOR BACK THEN IT'S GOING TO BE OFFERED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WILL ALSO JUST AS FAR AS EXPECTATION AND LET PEOPLE KNOW THAT YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS TESTING IS GOING ON NOW IS PART IS AN ADULT SO IT'S GOING TO BE SEVERAL MONTHS OUT BEFORE WE CAN ACTUALLY GET PEDIATRIC SAFETY TRIALS. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU. MR ARAMBULA MISTER O'DONNELL. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M I'M GOING TO ADDRESS MY FIRST FEW QUESTIONS TO DR GREGSON WHAT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IF I COULD AND I SHE'S COMING TO THE MIKE I JUST FIRST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING M HERE TODAY IT. IS MY FIRST TIME SITTING ON SUB TO ACTUALLY MY FIRST TIME IN AN EDUCATION HEARING AND WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT IF I COULD TO TALK ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF EDUCATION AT LEAST FOR ME. I WORE THIS MASK ON PURPOSE TODAY BECAUSE I WAS AT A RECENT GROUNDBREAKING WHERE WE HAVE A SATELLITE CAMPUS FOR FRESNO CITY COLLEGE AND AT THAT GROUNDBREAKING WE HAD PASTOR B. T. LEWIS WHO TOLD US IN ARISTOTLE QUOTE. THAT THE ROOTS OF EDUCATION ARE BITTER BT THE FRUITS ARE SWEET. AS I START TO THINK ABOUT ALL THE SACRIFICES THAT HAVE BEEN MADE BY SO MANY PEOPLE SO WE CAN HAVE. OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN EDUCATION. MY GRANDPARENTS WHO NEVER WANTS TO A SINGLE DAY OF SCHOOL SO THAT WE COULD TRY TO. BECOME SOMETHING OURSELF INSPIRES ME TO WANT TO CREATE THOSE SAME OPPORTUNITIES FOR CHILDREN TODAY. BUT I WISH TO SPEAK ABOUT ANOTHER ARISTOTLE QUOTE RIGHT NOW WHICH IS EDUCATION OF THE MIND WITHOUT EDUCATING THE HEART. IS NO EDUCATION AT ALL. AND IT IS IN THAT SPIRIT THAT I WISH TO ASK MY FIRST QUESTION A FEW DOCTOR GREGSON. WHAT IS THE CURRENT STATE OF MENTAL HEALTH FOR CHILDREN AND TEACHERS IN OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM. WHAT ARE THE DRIVERS OF THE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES CHILDREN AND TEACHERS ARE FACING AND HOW IS THIS PROBLEM BEING ADDRESSED. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR YOUR QUESTION AT MENTAL HEALTH HAS BEEN ON OUR MINDS IT SINCE MARCH THIRTEENTH. WHEN OUR SCHOOLS. WERE SHELTERING IN PLACE AND SCHOOL BUILDINGS WERE CLOSED. RCT PRETENDED OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TONY THURMOND HAS THAT MADE IT A PRIORITY TO BRING TOGETHER THE MENTAL HEALTH COALITIONS ACROSS THE STATE. TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE A PATCHWORK. WILL ACROSS THE- FOUR ARE STILL TO ACCESS MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT AND SO HE HAD BEEN DILIGENTLY WORKING WITH THE MENTAL HEALTH COALITION TO ENSURE THAT. ALL OF OUR MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS ACROSS THE STATE ARE CONNECTED WITH EACH OTHER AND CONNECTED WITH DISTRICTS AND THE DISTRICTS ARE UNDERSTANDING WHERE THEY CAN GO FOR THEIR STUDENTS TO TAKEAT MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT. THIS IS A VERY TRAUMATIC TIME FOR OUR STUDENTS AND THE ADULTS IN THE SYSTEM WHO ARE CARING FOR OUR STUDENTS THERE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT AND SHARING THAT WE ARE MAKING MENTAL HEALTH A PRIORITY IS ABSOLUTELY A MUST. IN OUR GUIDANCE WE MADE A HEAVY EMPHASIS ON ENSURING THAT THAT NOT ONLY WILD TEACHERS WERE PROVIDING CONTENT AREA INSTRUCTION THAT THEY WERE ALSO LOOKING AT THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL ASPECT OF THEIR STUDENTS. ENSURING THAT THEY WERE CONNECTING ENSURING THAT THEY WERE. PROVIDING TIME TO CONNECT AND ASK QUESTIONS THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL INSTRUCTIONAL TIME. SEEING HOW THEY'RE DOING I KNOW MANY TEACHERS PROVIDED ASSIGNMENT THAT ASKED STUDENTS TO EXPRESS THEMSELVES AND HOW THEY WERE FEELING IN DIFFERENT WAYS AND SO MENTAL HEALTH IS DEFINITELY A MUST AS FAR AS PRIORITIZING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT FOR THE STUDENTS. AND THE. ADULTS WERE CARING FOR THE STUDENT. YOU FIND DR GREG I DO. REALLY WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE STATE THAT YOU MADE FIRST THAT THESE ARE VERY DRAMATIC TIMES WHETHER OR NOT IT'S THE ECONOMIC DISTRESS THE SOCIAL DISTANCING THE ISOLATION THAT IS OCCURRING THROUGH THIS PANDEMIC. ACES ARE OCCURRING TO OUR CHILDREN TODAY WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO RESOURCES YOU HAD MENTIONED THAT THERE ARE A PATCHWORK OF SERVICES AND THAT- SUPERINTENDENT THURMOND IS WORKING WITH THE COALITION I WOULD LIKE TO IF YOU CAN HE WAS A FORMER COLLEAGUE OF OURS HERE ON THE DIESS. TO EXTEND AN INVITATION TO CONTINUE THOSE CONVERSATIONS WITH OUR OFFICES I SPECIFICALLY WOULD LIKE TO LOOK INTO HOW WE CAN PLANET TAKE AWAY THE SILOS BETWEEN EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROVIDING THE SERVICES THAT ARE NEEDED DURING THESE TRYING TIMES. HOW CAN WE NOW THAT WE START TO BREAK THE SILOS DOWN THINK ABOUT TELEHEALTH IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY NOW FOR US TO CREATE A NEW SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES FOR SOCIAL EMOTIONAL LEARNING THAT IS AN- OPPORTUNITY OUT OF THIS CRISIS AND SO I THINK THAT'S AN AREA I'D LOVE TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH YOUR OFFICE AND WOULD LOVE TO BE ABLE TO FOLLOW UP AS- I THINK THAT'S A MAJOR AREA THAT WE CAN WORK ON NEXT YEAR. BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WAS RECENTLY WITHIN THE LA DAILY NEWS WHICH JUST SHARED SOME INFORMATION FROM A PARENT SURVEY WHICH SHOWED THAT 76% OF PARENTS SAID THEIR CHILDREN AREN'T LEARNING OR MAKING PROGRESS. WITH DISTANCE LEARNING. AND 74% SAID THEIR CHILDREN REGRESSED IN THEIR BEHAVIOR AND DEMONSTRATION OF SKILLS AND FOR CD. DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF THAT DATA POINT IS GENERALLY TRUE ACROSS THE STATE. OR IS THE STATE DATA DIFFERENT. CAN YOU SHARE MORE ABOUT WHAT YOU HAVE DONE TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM WHAT ARE THE BEST PRACTICES THAT EXIST AND WHAT CAN BE DONE TO IMPROVE THE SITUATION. ESPECIALLY FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS. ALL RIGHT TO SAY WE WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION WITH YOU AND FOCUSING ON THE MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORT I THINK THAT WOULD BE A GREAT PARTNERSHIP. IS FAR AS DISTANCE LEARNING AND OUR OUR STUDENTS THAT HAVE NEEDED MORE SERVICES. SPECIFICALLY AROUND SPECIAL EDUCATION ARE ENGLISH LEARNERS OUR STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING READERS THERE HAVE BEEN MANY LEARNING FOR FROM THE SPRING INTO THE FALL MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS TO HAVE PUT IN PLACE DIAGNOSTIC ASSESSMENT. AND PROGRESS MONITORING ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHERE STUDENTS ARE AREAS OF GROWTH OUR ADS AND WHAT THEY NEEDED TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE GETTING THE CORRECT SERVICES FOR WHETHER ACADEMICALLY. MANY OF OUR DISTRICT HAVE BEEN BRINGING OUT THERE BUT BRINGING BACK THEIR MOST STRUGGLING STUDENTS AND SMALL COHORTS SAN DIEGO UNIFIED STARTED BRINGING BACK TO STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND SMALL COHORTS. SAN JUAN UNIFIED IS STARTING THOSE THE ELK GROVE UNIFIED SO MANY OF OUR LARGER DISTRICT IN OUR SMALLER DISTRICTS ARE PROVIDING IN PERSON SUPPORT IN A SAFE MANNER. IN A SMALL COHORT WAY. WE HAVE ALSO THE SCENE PROVIDED GUIDANCE PHYSICAL ON HOW TO ADDRESS THESE. STATE WHO NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE- ACADEMIC STRUCTURE THROUGH OUR MULTI LINGUAL ONLINE DOCUMENTS THROUGH OUR RE OPENING GUIDANCE AND OVER THE HUNDRED WEBINARS WE DID IT THROUGH OUCH FROM MARCH UNTIL THIS POINT IN TIME. YOU KNOW I DID WANNA HIGHLIGHT IF I COULD EARLIER YOU HAD SAID WHAT A MONUMENTAL JOB OR TEACHERS HAVE DONE THIS YEAR AND IF YOU WOULD JUST GIVE ME AN OPPORTUNITY I HAVE THREE KIDS WERE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. AND SO FOR MISS LITTLE MISS LONG QUESTION MISS HUDSON WHO ARE DOING A TREMENDOUS JOB WITH MY DAUGHTERS AND ALLOWING THEM TO GROW RIGHT NOW INTO. YOUNG ADULTS I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT AND RECOGNIZE HOW HARD THE WORK IS FOR TEACHERS AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM TO DO AND- HOW MUCH THEY NEED TO BE SUPPORTED THROUGH THESE TRYING TIMES WHICH IS WHY I'M TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT IF WE CAN BLEND THOSE SILOS BETWEEN EDUCATION AND HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES. BUT THAT WILL BRING ME TO MY THIRD QUESTION BECAUSE I DEAL A FAIR AMOUNT WITH THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. AND SO I WANTED TO ASK IF YOU COULD HOW MANY CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE TO CD HAD HE HAVE IN ITS SYSTEM. AND OF THOSE HOW MANY HELP THE TECHNOLOGY HI EITHER COMPUTER OR WIFI ACCESS IN ORDER TO PARTICIPATE IN ONLINE LEARNING. AND THEN I WILL ASK A VERY SPECIFIC QUESTION AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE DIRECTNESS OF IT. BUT HOW IS THAT ASSESSMENT DETERMINED. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THE TECHNOLOGY. AND IF YOU COULD PLEASE ANSWER THE QUESTION. BY DESCRIBING THE DISTRIBUTION OF RESPONSIBILITIES. THANK YOU FOR YOUR QUESTION REGARDING FOSTER CARE. IT IS WE HAVE OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND FOSTER CARE STUDENTS ACROSS THESTATE AND THAT MADE THAT NUMBER MAY BE A LITTLE BIT OFF BUT THAT IS THE NUMBER WE HAVE IN THIS MOMENT IN TIME AS FAR AS THE DIGITAL COMPONENT OF ENSURING THAT OUR FOSTER CARE YOUTH GET THE DEVICES THAT THEY NEED. C. D. E. HAVE PARTNERED TO DILIGENTLY WITH OUR DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE AND THE MANY. DONATIONS FROM THE DATE THAT HAVE COME FROM THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE. TO ENSURE THAT OUR FOSTER CARE YOUTH WERE PRIORITIZED AND THAT THEY HAVE THE DEVICES THAT THEY NEED. TO OUR DEPARTMENT WORK TO DILIGENTLY WITH FOSTER CARE YOUTH COORDINATORS AT EVERY COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION TO pENSURE THAT EACH EACH FOSTER CARE YOU. GOT THE DEVICE FIRST. THE SECOND PART OF THAT IS HOW DOES THE ASSESSMENT DETERMINED AND HIS RESPONSIBILITIES THAT. R. AS WHETHER OR NOT THE FOSTER CARE YOUTH NEEDED THE DEVICES THAT WAS DETERMINED BY THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY. THEY ARE THEN THE ONES RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT ONCE WE PROVIDE THEM THE DEVICE THE DEVICE GETS IN THE HANDS OF THE STUDENTS WE USE THE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AS A DISTRIBUTION MECHANISM TO ENSURE EACH OF THOSE STUDENTS RECEIVE THEIR DEVICES. AND I WOULD JUST SHARE WITH THE MCCARTY LANDS- CONCERN WHEN WE HAVE SYSTEMS MULTIPLE SYSTEMS NEEDING TO INTEGRATE TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT- WE HAVE THE END GOAL IN MIND. AND SO WE JUST ASK THAT WE ENSURE THOSE RESPONSIBILITIES ARE. DETAILED SO THAT OUR FOSTER KIDS CAN HAVE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES. IF YOU COULD I HAVE JUST A FEW MORE QUESTIONS AND HEADS JUST BECAUSE I DON'T GET TO SIT ON THESE EDUCATION PANELS THAT OFTEN. BUT WHAT IS THE CURRENT SITUATION WITH INDIVIDUALS INDIVIDUALIZED EDUCATION PLANS FOR CHILDREN WITH SPECIAL NEEDS INCLUDING WHETHER ALL CHILDREN'S WITH IT PEAS HAVE BEEN EVALUATED. AND IF THEY HAVE HAD THEIR IEPS MODIFIED IF CD IS NOT TRACKING THAT WHY OR WHY NOT. YEAH WE- A GREAT SETTING AND- AT THE DEPARTMENT WE DO HAVE A MONITORING SYSTEM BOARD INDIVIDUAL EDUCATION PLAN OUR ENTIRE SPECIAL EDUCATION DIVISION SUPPORT EACH OF THE DISTRICTS IN ENSURING THAT THE I. PEAS ARE UP TO DATE AND THAT THOSE SERVICES OUTLINED IN THE IDPS ARE BEING PROVIDED TO THE STUDENTS. EVEN THROUGH THE VERY CHALLENGING TIME WE ARE WORKING DIRECTLY THROUGH OUR CELL PHONES ARE COUNTY OFFICES AND OUR DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS ARE BEING AFFECTED AND TIMELY MANNER AND BEING PROVIDE THE SUPPORTS AND SERVICES THAT. ARE OUTLINED IN THERE I EAT PEAS. JUST BECAUSE I REPRESENT ROULERS I DO. OBLIGATED TO ASK ABOUT THE CURRENT STATUS OF WIFI ACCESS. ACROSS THE STATE FOR ALL CHILDREN AND WHAT IS BEING DONE ABOUT THE SITUATION. WELL WE HAVE BEEN WORKING OUR STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION HAS CALLED FOR THE DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE THAT WAS CHAIRED BY SENATOR LEYVA SEVERAL OTHER ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WERE A PART OF. THIS DIGITAL DIVIDE TASK FORCE AND THEY HAVE BEEN CONNECTING WITH INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS TO ENSURE THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE PROVIDING CONNECTIVITY AT LOWER RATES FAR LOWER INCOME FAMILIES AND ALSO WE ARE WORKING WITH THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION ON ENSURING THAT CAN ACTIVITY IS. SLOWING LIKE ELECTRICITY ACROSS THE STATE WE HAD A HEARING YESTERDAY THAT OUR SUPERINTENDENT PARTICIPATED IN OUTLINING ALL OF THE PLANS IN THE PARTNERSHIP. TO ENSURE THAT OUR CONNECTIVITY'S HAPPENING FOR EVERY STUDENT ACROSS THE STATE BUT THIS IS A COLLECTIVE RESPONSIBILITY AND THAT WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER ON HOW TO DO THAT. BECAUSE THIS IS THAT SOMETHING. THAT OUR STUDENTS DESERVE. IF I COULD I WOULD END WITH THE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT TORKEL QUESTION OR STATEMENT IF YOU COULD BUT- IF WE'RE REALLY LOOKING AT WHAT C. FREE OPENINGS OF SCHOOLS LOOK LIKE. I WOULD OPINE THAT WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT TEACHERS AND PARENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THOSE LOCAL DECISIONS. MOST OF WHAT I HEARD WERE ABOUT SCHOOL DISTRICTS MAKING THOSE DECISIONS AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE PROVIDING THE EDUCATION WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES WHO. ARE EXPOSING THEMSELVES POTENTIALLY TO AN ILLNESS ARE ALSO INCLUDED AND MUST BE INCLUDED IN THOSE DISCUSSIONS. WITH THAT I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW WE DO THE HARD WORK FOR RE OPENING OUR SCHOOLS I BELIEVE THAT'S HOW. WE MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE ROOTS OF EDUCATION SO THAT SO MANY OF OUR KIDS CAN BLOSSOM INTO THE YOUNG ADULTS THAT THEY WILL BECOME. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO ASK QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SOMEONE MEMBER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER O'DONNELL. I THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO ALL THE PARTICIPANTS TODAY'S HEARING I JUST A FEW QUESTIONS- ONE OF THE QUESTIONS I'VE BEEN HEARING FROM A COUPLE CBO IS- IT'S WITH REGARD TO SUPPLEMENTAL. WELL IT'S WITH REGARD TO A POTENTIAL REDUCTION SUPPLEMENTAL CONSECRATION GRANT FUNDING. BECAUSE THE DOCUMENTATION IS A COMING BACK FROM PARENTS THAT IS THE REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION. TO GET BASICALLY COLLECT FREE AND REDUCED MEAL FORMS- THE LOGISTICS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ARE VERY DIFFICULT THIS TIME. ASSEMBLY BILL REALLY HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO FILL THEM OUT QUITE FRANKLY BECAUSE THE MANDATE IS BASICALLY VENDOR TO FEED FOLKS AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. BUT THERE'S A BIT OF A HURDLE HERE AND- ITS- THAT DOCUMENTATION IS REQUIRED. FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO RECEIVE THEIR- CFF THEIR SUPPLEMENTAL CONSERVE GREAT. CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDING- HAVE YOU BEEN HERE YOU MAY THIS MAY BE FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE HAVE YOU. HAVE YOU. HEARD OF THAT CONCERNED YOU HAVE ANY PLANS TO ADDRESS IT I KNOW WE'VE HELD HARMLESS. THE ADA BUT. THIS IS REALLY A SEPARATE ISSUE I WOULD ARGUE. YES YOU SO MUCH ASSEMBLY MEMBER- O'DONNELL SO WE ARE AWARE OF AS SOME CONVERSATIONS AMONG CERTAIN CBO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. WHO HAVE HAD SOME CONCERNS AROUND AND DUPLICATED PERCENTAGES WHICH IS YOU KNOW WHAT WE WERE FOR THAT'S THE SORT OF THE SHORTHAND TERM FOR- THE PERCENTAGES OF STUDENTS THAT GENERATE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS FUNDS AND THE LARGEST OF THOSE BEING THOSE STUDENTS WHO ARE. FOR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEALS ONE OF- ONE OF THE AS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF- THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S PROVIDING A WAIVER TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO ALLOW THEM TO RUN THEIR STE THEIR SUMMER MEAL PROGRAMS INSTEAD OF THEIR NORMAL SCHOOL MEAL PROGRAMS WHICH IS A VERY EXCELLENT THING- BECAUSE IT ALLOWS- EVERYONE'S NO KIDS TO GET FAT AS YOU MENTION. IS THAT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME REQUIREMENTS AROUND FAMILIES FILLING OUT FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEAL APPLICATIONS- TO HELP SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEIR COLLECTION OF THE STATE AT THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION RECENTLY EXTENDED. THE TIME PERIOD BY WHICH SUCH AS SCHOOLS HAVE TO REPORT THEIR FREE AND REDUCED PRICE MEAL ELIGIBILITY BY TWO MONTHS. SO NOW THAT INFORMATION IS NOT DUE UNTIL THE END OF DECEMBER OR START MID DECEMBER I BELIEVE- SO THAT HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT OF VIDEOS THAT'S VERY HELPFUL IN GETTING THE INFORMATION AND- MANY MANY OF OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND WE WOULD EXPECT THIS GIVEN THE ECONOMIC. CONDITIONS THAT WERE AND ARE ACTUALLY REPORTING THAT THEY HAVE MORE. SCREEN REDUCE PRICE NO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS AND FAMILIES THAN THEY HAD IN TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY. SO OUR HOPE IS THAT- SCHOOLS CAN GET THE DOCUMENTATION- OF THEIR FAMILIES PRIOR TO THAT EXTENDED- THAT- MANY SCHOOLS MAY SEE THAT THEY ACTUALLY HAVE HIGHER FREE INTRODUCED PERSONAL PERCENTAGES. THAN OTHERWISE WE THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT IN TERMS OF THEIR ENGAGE WITH FAMILIES. I'M TO BE REACHING OUT AND GETTING THE INFORMATION FROM THOSE FAMILIES SO THAT THEY CAN ALSO ASCERTAIN WHAT OTHER NEEDS AS FAMILIES HAVE. SO AT THIS POINT- WE BELIEVE THAT THE- ADDITIONAL TIME WILL BE HELPFUL IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. GETTING THE PAPERBACK THE PAPERWORK BACK FROM FAMILIES BUT WE ARE AWARE AND ARE MONITORING THIS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. GREAT THANK YOU AND I GET A DISTRICT GETS A CONTINUING CONCERN THAT DISTRICTS HAVE SO I THINK WE NEED TO WATCH CLOSELY. SO THEY DON'T COME UP SHORT YET ARE. ARE SERVING THE SAME THE SAME STUDENTS. I LEX QUESTIONS WITH REGARD TO RE OPENING SCHOOLS- IN IN THE CAR AND I'M NOT SURE WHO THIS QUESTION WHO DO WHO MIGHT JUMP ON THIS QUESTION- BUT CAN COUNTIES IMPOSE REQUIREMENTS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA. DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS A CONDITION FOR REOPENING SCHOOLS. I'LL GIVE AN EXAMPLE LONG BEACH. THE CITY HAS THERE'S THREE CITIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THEIR OWN HEALTH DEPARTMENT- THANKS LONG BEACH PASADENA AND BERKELEY I BELIEVE. BUT THE CITY'S HEALTH DEPARTMENT AS- IT IMPOSED REQUIREMENT THAT APPARENTLY AS I UNDERSTAND IT AND AS OF. THAT COMMUNICATION WITH THE DISTRICT THIS. THEIR FIRMNESS. THAT STUDENTS WILL HAVE TO HAVE THE FLU VACCINE- I GUESS IT'S PROBABLY A SHOT. IF IN ORDER FOR THEM TO RETURN TO SCHOOL. THIS IS DOCTOR PRODUCT RESPONDED. SO CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE DO ONE THING DR REALLY REPEAT THE QUESTION IS CAN CAN. CAN SCHOOL DISTRICTS I'M SORRY CAN CAN'T APART CAN COUNTY SIMPLE REQUIREMENTS BEYOND THOSE REQUIRED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS A CONDITION OF REOPENING SCHOOLS. SERVER TO HELP AND IN THIS CASE IT'S ACTUALLY A CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT ON A COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT. THAT'S THE KIND OF EXPLAINED EVERITT ALTERNATE BACK YOU. SURE HELLO YES- THIS IS STOCKED UPON AGAIN YES A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS ABSOLUTELY YOU'RE RIGHT THERE SIXTY ONE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES AND THREE CITIES. DO HAVE LOCAL AUTHORITY TO BE STRICTER THAN THE STATE HEALTH DEPARTMENT ON ANY ACTUAL- HELLO THIS ORDER FROM THE STATE OR HEALTH OFFICER AND THEY CANNOT ALLOW MORE THINGS AND A LOT OF THE STATE. THE LOCAL OFFICES CAN OFTEN BE STRICTER. SO IS THAT IS IT IN THE END OF YOUR DEFINITION OF BEING STRICTER. IS IT ALLOWABLE FOR A COUNTY HEALTH DEPARTMENT IN THIS CASE THE CITY HEALTH DEPARTMENT TO IMPOSE SUCH A REQUIREMENT THAT A FLU VACCINE BE REQUIRED. YES WELL THE VISITORS CAN ISSUE ORDERS OR REQUIREMENTS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. STILL CONCERNING TO ME THANK YOU. THEN THE NEXT QUESTION IS FOR A- THE TO HEALTH RELATED QUESTION DEPARTMENT HEALTH RECORDED QUESTION- IT HAS TO DO WITH THE GOVERNOR'S PURCHASE OF AT LEAST ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF COVERT TASKS. AND THE QUESTION IS WILL THE ADMINISTRATION ALLOCATE THOSE TESTS TO SCHOOLS AND ALL OF A BASED ON THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY HAVE. IF DAY I GET TO MEET TESTING IS KEY RIGHT NOW WHAT WHAT WE NEED TO TRY TO CONTROL OUR VIRUS MUCH AS WE CAN. GIVEN THAT WE DON'T HAVE A VACCINE SO TEXT TESTING IS. USUALLY I KNOW LA UNIFIED AS A- YOU KNOW THEY DEVELOP A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT PROGRAM MAY BE A MODEL FOR THE STATE EVENTUALLY. BUT THAT. ARE ARE THOSE TESTS THAT THE GOVERNOR IS A- HAS. HAS PURCHASED GO GOING TO GO TO SCHOOL SITES. SERVICES DOCTOR POLLOCK AND WE DO HAVE OUR TESTING TASK FORCE AND- WITH THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEW PERKINELMER LAVALIER ABSOLUTELY WORKING CLOSELY WITH OTHER PARTNERS TO. PRIORITIZE AND WORK WITH LOCAL DEPARTMENTS AND LOCAL SCHOOLS- AROUND TESTING IN THE SCHOOL SETTING. SO IS THE IS ARE THOSE TESTS THAT THE GOVERNOR PURCHASE GOING TO GO TO IS JUST TO SCHOOL SITES OR TO COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND THEN BE DEALT OUT TO SCHOOL SIDES. DID YOU KNOW THAT ANSWER NOW. IF YOU DON'T IT'S OKAY I'M JUST. YEAH I THINK MY ANSWER SPECIFIC TO OUR NEW LAB ARE PERKINELMER LAB IN A LOT OF OUR EXPANDING OUR CAPACITY IN GENERAL FOR A LONGER TERM AND YOU KNOW WE'RE DOUBLING OUR CAPACITY OF PCR TESTING ACROSS THE STATE WITH THIS PURPOSE NUMBER ELEVEN SCHOOLS AND ONE OF OUR TOP PRIORITIES. I'M NOT SURE WHICH SPECIFIC LAB TESTS YOU ARE REFERRING TO BUT WE CAN FIND OUT WELL THE RETURN OF IT'S BEEN IN THE PRESS SOMEONE SENT OUT A PRESS RELEASE THAT SAID THEY'RE GOING TO PURCHASE ALL THESE TESTS AND A GREAT IT WAS. MY QUESTION IS ARE THOSE GOING TO GO TO SCHOOLS. SO WE'LL NEED TO GET BACK TO. OKAY THANK YOU. THAT IS GOING. I KNOW IT QUESTIONS ASKED- EARLIER ABOUT THE TESTING AND THE REAP THE REPORTING OF THAT TESTED TESTING AND THEN THE CASES LINKED TO SCHOOLS AND WILL BE REPORTED OUT OF THE DISTRICT LEVEL AT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT LEVEL EVEN MAYBE THE SCHOOL SITE LEVEL AND OTHERS CONCERNS ABOUT CONFIDENTIALITY ALONG THOSE LINES. BUT AND THEN LUMPING SOME CONCERNED ABOUT LOVING SCHOOL BASED INFECTION WITH OVERALL. COUNTY DATA MIGHT NOT NECESSARILY BE HELPFUL AND I COME FROM A DISTRICT COURT NEXT DOOR THEY'RE OPEN. MY DISTRICT IS SHUT DOWN SO I'M GETTING BEAT UP ON THIS ISSUE PRETTY HANDILY BY PARENTS WHO ARE VERY CONCERNED THAT JUST YOU KNOW A MILE AWAY SCHOOLS ARE OPEN KIDSARE GOING THEIR MODIFIED. THE SCHOOLS AND THAT ARE OPEN THE SCHOOL THAT IS OPEN OF MODIFIED BUT IT'S JUST A- IT'S A REAL CONCERN TO FOLKS TO. LET MY DISTRICT HAVE KIDS LIKE ME SO THAT I THINK YOU THANK YOU. THAT YOU MISTER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANK. THANK YOU MISTER JUST JUST TO REITERATE I THINK A LOT OF MY COMMENTS MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS SCHOOL RE OPENING HAS TO BE I HAVE I WOULD IMAGINE IT'S THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN EACH AND SINGLE EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR DISTRICTS IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY GETTING QUESTIONS. AS ARCHER MENTIONED WE ARE ALL PARENTS OF A PUBLIC SCHOOL CHILDREN AND SO IT'S AN ISSUE THAT WE FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY- I MEAN IT'S SOMETHING THAT REALLY- WE NEED I THINK WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE IN TERMS OF. COORDINATION BETWEEN DEPARTMENTS EDUCATION BUT FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PLUS ALL OUR VARIOUS LOCAL COUNTIES AND THEIR DESTRUCTION OF QUIET THE VERY CHALLENGING ENTERPRISE ESPECIALLY BECAUSE EVERY DISTRICT HAS COMPLETED LOCAL AUTHORITY AND AUTONOMY. BUT I THINK WE HAVE AS A STAY HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING. POSSIBLE TO WORK TO GET OUR SCHOOLS. OPEN SAFELY- IN A MANNER THAT SAY FOR OUR TEACHERS SAY FOR OUR CHILDREN STAY FOR THE STAFF- I KNOW THAT'S ALL OUR GOAL- I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE- DIVIDE IN TERMS OF EQUITY BECAUSE I'M STARTING TO SEE. MANY OF OUR PRIVATE SCHOOLS IN SAN FRANCISCO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE OPENING GUIDELINES ARE STARTING TO OPEN AGAIN. BUT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE VERY SLOW TO DO THAT- I WOULD POINT TO A PARTICULAR MODEL THAT HOUSE- STARTED WORKING IN TERMS OF SOME SUCCESS WHICH IS IN SAN MATEO COUNTY THE OTHER COUNTY THE REPRESENT. WHERE YOU HAVE THE DISTRICTS WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH THEIR- COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND ENSURE THAT THERE IS A PROPER TESTING PROTOCOLS. BEING DEVELOPED- IN THAT TESTING AGAIN JUST TO FOLLOW UP WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM PALM BEACH IS TALK ABOUT THAT TESTING IS PROBABLY. ONE OF THE MAJOR ISSUES FOR TEACHERS AS THEY STRUGGLE WITH WET WEATHER TO COME BACK OR NOT SO IN TERMS OF JUST. GOING TO. BACK TO DOCTOR POND IS YOU KNOW ARE YOU ARE YOU GIVING- GUIDANCE TO THE COUNTIES AND LOCAL DISTRICTS ABOUT- TESTING PROTOCOLS RIGHT NOW I THINK. THE IDEA OR THE CURRENT GUIDELINES PLEASE CREEK FROM WRONG IS TO. TEST TEACHERS POTENTIALLY ONCE EVERY TWO MONTHS MAYBE THAT'S MY LOCAL GUIDANCE PERSISTS AT THE STATE GUIDANCE. BUT ARE YOU ARE YOU STARTING TO- TRY TO DEVELOP GUIDANCE IN RELATION WITH SEEDEATER. LET DISTRICTS KNOW RICK BROTHER YOU KNOW WHAT IS WHAT IS CONSIDERED SAFE TESTING PROTOCOLS FOR OUR TEACHERS AS THEY START TO CONSIDER GOING BACK. SO YES WE ARE WORKING VERY CLOSELY AGAIN WITH- THE WORKGROUP THERE'S A WORKING GROUP WORKING WHETHER TESTING TEST FOR THE MINISTRATION- AND OUR PARTNERS AT. THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND CD AND ALSO- PARTITION OF THE LABOR MANAGEMENT REGARDING TESTING I THINK FOR THE MOST PART RESOURCES THAT WE ACTUALLY HAVE AND THE MOST IMPORTANT. IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN THERE IS A CASE THAT THAT PERSON IS TESTED IN THAT CLOSE CONTACTS ARE TESTED- INTERNET OF PEOPLE ARE TESTED THAT IS AFTER THE PARTY AND THAT IS YOUKNOW THERE ARE PLENTY OF REASONS FOR THAT AS WELL AND THEN. WE ARE CONTINUE TO WORK ON THE INVOLVING TESTING GUIDELINES ABOUT ANY TESTING GONNA. SWIM WITH THIS KIND OF BE RELEASE. WHAT IT IS. THE WORD IT IS ACTUALLY MEETING AND AGAIN THIS THE SCIENCE THAT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE YOU KNOW ACROSS THE NATION AS WELL. SO I'M TAKING THAT AS A I DON'T KNOW WHEN YOU WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF THE SCHOOL YEAR SO I DON'T KNOW HOW. YOU ANTICIPATE LOCAL DISTRICTS WOULD HAVE TO BARGAIN MANY OF THESE CONTRACTS. ONE OF WHICH IS STICKING POINTS IS WHICH IS TESTING- I KNOW YOU'RE NOT A LABOR. LAWYER BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T COME OUT WITH TESTING. PROTOCOLS FOR OUR STATE IT PUTS OUR DISTRICTS IN A VERY TOUGH. POSITIONS A WIN WITH THOSE GUIDELINES BE RELEASED WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF A SCHOOL YEAR AND WITHOUT THIS KIND ON SEPT MIGHT BE VERY VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR SCHOOLS TO OPEN UP. SO AS AS IS ALREADY IN OUR JULY GUIDANCE I THINK THERE ARE SOME POTENTIAL RECOMMENDATIONS THERE AND AS I MENTIONED THE MOST IMPORTANT GUIDELINES AROUND FIRST TESTING OF SYSTEMATIC CASES AND CONTACTS. CAN YOU REFERRAL I APOLOGIZE SINCE JULY FEELS LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO CAN YOU REFRESH MY MEMORY AS TO WHAT THOSE GUYS. GOT WHAT THAT GUIDANCE WAS. SO IT TALKS ABOUT A POTENTIAL IN IT YOU ALSO NEED TO VERY IT BASED ON THE LOCAL CONDITIONS N THE LOCAL I. PENOLOGY THE LEVEL OF SPREAD. OR ONE LITTLE TRANSMISSION AND THE COMMUNITY THAT IS WHY THERE IS NOT A ONE SIZE FITS ALL POTENTIALLY BUT IN THE JULY GUIDANCE WE TALK ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR CONDITION TO BE- TESTING- BELIEVE IT'S 25% EVERY TWO MONTHS IS A BIT OF A CONDITION AND AGAIN THE MOST IMPORTANT RECOMMENDATION THAT WE'VE ALREADY MADE IS TESTING RESOURCES FOR. THIS OUR- CASES AND CONTACTS. I'M SORRY CAN YOU REPEAT THAT THE BLACK THE LAST TWO AGAIN NOT I COULDN'T VERY CLEARLY APOLOGIZE. THE MOST IMPORTANT DOCUMENTATION THERE TO BE TESTING CASES AND CONTACTS IN THE SETTINGS AND NOT IS ALREADY THE RECOMMENDATION. TESTING CASES IN CONTEXT MEANING THAT IF- YOU GET A POSITIVE SOMEONE GETS A POSITIVE TEST- BUT THE CHALLENGES IF YOU'RE TESTING ONLY EVERY TWO MONTHS. SOMEBODY COULD HAVE EXPOSED THE ENTIRE SCHOOL THAT TWO MONTHS. PERIOD. SO AGAIN THIS YOU KNOW I THINK ALL OF THE OTHER THINGS WE TALKED ABOUT AS WELL OUR MODELS THAT WORK FOR IF YOU HAVE EVERYONE'S WEARING FACE COVERINGS USING PHYSICAL SYSTEM SAYING THE COVERT MODELS AND THEN AGAIN WHEN YOU HAVE A CASE YOU CAN IDENTIFY THEM QUICKLY IDENTIFY THE CONTACTS SO THOSE ARE THE MOST IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES. RIGHT BUT- COULD LOOK LET'S LET'S TALK ABOUT TO ENTER YEAH TWO OTHER VERY HIGH CONTACT ENVIRONMENTS WHICH IS WITH PRESENCE AS WELL AS WITH. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES WERE HAVING A HEARING ON SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES TOMORROW- THAT IS NOT THE PROTOCOL FOR HI THERE ARE CORRECTIONS DEPARTMENT OR ARE. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES I'M JUST TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. WHEN YOU BRING. CHILDREN SO THOSE PROBLEMS RIGHT THOSE SETTINGS ARE RESIDENTIAL SETTINGS ARE CONGREGATE LIVING SETTINGS AND IT'S ALSO ALL ADULTS SO AGAIN YOU KNOW I THINK THE OTHER. THING THAT- BUT NOTHING KENNEDY AFTER X. AND OTHERS HAVE CONTINUE TO YOU KNOW THE STUDY IN THE YOU KNOW MORE MORE EVIDENCE SHOWS THAT YOUNG CHILDREN ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE SERIOUS HONEST THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO INFECT OTHERS. I AM IN CONTACT OF EDUCATION- OF RESOURCES YOU KNOW AND- STUDIES LESS THAN ONE LESS THAN 10% OF THE INDEX CASES ARE TYPICALLY CHILDREN TO CHILDREN MUSCLES OKAY JUST READ SO IT'S A VERY DIFFERENT SETTING THAN A RESIDENTIAL SETTING. WITH ADULT AND ELDERLY. NO I COMPLETELY MISSED AND I THINK AS A- WITH YOUNGER CHILDREN I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND- THE REST LEVEL FOR THEM I THINK THE CHALLENGE IS HOW DO YOU CONVINCE THE TEACHERS AND THE JANITORS AND THE- PRINCIPLES IN THE ADMINISTRATORS. IN THE NURSES TO. COME BACK BECAUSE RIGHT NOW- MANY OF THEM ARE CONCERNED ABOUT. GOING BACK. SO THAT IS EXACTLY WHY WE AREN'T IN THIS WORKING GROUP AND WORKING TOGETHER WITH YOU KNOW THE DIFFERENT PARTNERS TO HELP DETERMINE THE BEST. K. LINES IN THE BEST WAY TO GET. TO YOUR POINT TO HELP GET OUR SCHOOLS RE OPEN NON NON UNDERSTAND SO I'VE I'VE I APPRECIATE THAT. YOUR MEETING BUT WE'RE TO BASICALLY WE'RE TWO MONTHS INTO MOST SCHOOL YEAR SO WHEN IS THIS. GOD IS GOING TO BE COMING UP WE ARE WE TALKING LIKE WE GONNA COME OUT IN THE SUMMERTIME AFTER SCHOOL SO WE OFFER I THINK I THINK WHAT I'M TRYING TO CONVEY IS THAT IS NOT A REQUIREMENT OR RECOMMENDATION IN ORDER TO REOPEN SCHOOLS I'M BUT I'M TRYING TO CONVEY THAT PEOPLE ARE WAITING FOR THIS GUY HAS TO GO TO REOPEN THE SCHOOLS AND THAT. YOU HAVE TEACHERS AND THE TEACHERS ARE DISCUSSING THIS WITH EACH OF THEIR DISTRICTS AND AS FAR AS I CAN TELL IN THE VERY LIMITED KNOWLEDGE THAT I HAVE TALKING TO THE FEW DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT IS EVERYBODY IS ALL OVER THE MAP. IN THIS TESTING ISSUE IS CENTRAL TO EVERY BARGAINING DISCUSSION UP AND DOWN THE STATE. SO WHAT I'M TRYING TO CONVEY IS WHAT YOU'RE SAYING HEY. DISTRICTS YOU CAN DO WHATEVER YOU WANT WE'VE GIVEN YOU. A LITTLE BIT OF GUIDANCE BUT NOT REALLY MUCH DIRECTION. AND GO FORTH AND DO YOUR BEST I'M SAYING THAT. BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF GUIDANCE SCHOOLS MOST LIKELY. MAY NOT OPEN UP BECAUSE TEACHERS AND STAFF ARE NOT WILLING TO GO BACK. SO WHERE AREYOU GOING TO BE ISSUING FURTHER GUIDANCE BECAUSE- I THINK AGAIN. LET ME LET ME JUST BE EXTRAORDINARILY CLEAR. YOUR GUIDANCE MAY DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT SCHOOLS WILL RE OPEN OR NOT. SEOUL IS A TASK FORCE GOING TO DO SOMETHING IN THE NEXT WEEK OR TWO OR WE TALK IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THINGS ARE EVOLVING WE KNOW WE WE'RE YOU KNOW WE'RE BUILDING THE PLANE IN MID STREAM WE ALL ADMIT THAT AND WE'RE ALL TRYING TO DO THE BEST WE CAN. BUT I THINK THE ANSWER THAT YOU'VE GIVEN IS COMPLEELY. NOT UNDERSTANDING WHAT DISTRICTS AND TEACHERS NEED. SO WHEN THE TASK FORCE CAN ISSUES GUIDANCE. YEAH SO I THINK WITH TIME. I THINK WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO COME TO AN AGREEMENT TOGETHER ON THIS WITH OUR WORK FORCE WE WITH OUR I THINK YOU HAVE A LEGISLATURE THAT HAS BEEN- LOOKING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION BUT I DON'T KNOW I HAVE BEEN CONTACTED I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF MY OTHER COLLEAGUES HAVE BEEN CONTACTED WORKS. WERE ALL LISTED IN THE PHONE BOOK SO- YES HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU BUT- AGAIN WE HAVE TO. DO THIS LIKE IMMEDIATELY. GET A WE WE'VE WE'VE HEARD THE DEVASTATING EFFECTS OF HOW ON SCHOOL ARE NOT ABLE TO OPEN UP AND AGAIN THIS IS THIS IS ONE OF THE CENTRAL ISSUES TO KEEPING CLOSE KEEPING SCHOOLS CLOSED IN AGAIN I SEE FROM MY OTHER SCHOOLS THAT HAVE THE RESOURCES HAVE THE MONEY DON'T NEED. YOUR ASSISTANCE BUT THAT IS NOT THE WAY OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE SHAPING UP TO BE. SO THEY VERY MUCH NEED SO ARE YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE READY TO MEET TOMORROW AND I'LL JUST SAY THAT TO ME I THINK I THINK ALL OF US READY TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES THERE'S NOT A SINGLE LEGISLATURE THAT I'VE- HEARD OF. THAT HASN'T SAID THAT THIS IS NOT THE NUMBER ONE ISSUE IN THE DISTRICT I MEAN. THIS IS THIS IS GONNA BE THE ONE ISSUE THAT WE ARE CONSTANTLY HEARING FROM EVERYBODY ABOUT. ARMS SO I JUST WANTED TO FOLLOW UP- AND JUST UNDERSTAND WHAT SORT OF TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO- COUNTIES THAT YOU'RE GIVING ASIDE FROM TESTING JUST JUST TO- SORT OF CREATE SOME CONSISTENT PROTOCOLS AND SCHOOLS ARE REOPENING BECAUSE AGAIN. SEEMS TO BE. RATHER BROTHER BROAD AND FAIRLY SHE CAN SYSTEM WHICH I THINK THE CHALLENGE. ARE YOU ASKING ABOUT OVERALL GUIDANCE FOR SCHOOL GUIDANCE IN A VERY SPECIFIC SCHOOL SPECIFIC GUIDANCE THAT WAS ISSUED AS MENTIONED EARLIER THIS SUMMER AND CONTINUES TO BE UPDATED- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO- THE THAT IN THE RE OPENING FREE MARKET ALSO AGAIN TALKS ABOUT WHAT TO DO WITH CASES CONTACTS COHORTS WE ARE AGAIN UPDATING THAT AS I MENTIONED TO REALLY TALK ABOUT- BOOK ROLE OF THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT AND THE REFERRAL OF THAT THE SCHOOLS AND HAVING THE SCHOOL LIAISON. AND REINFORCING THAT IS REPORTABLE AND I ALSO MENTIONED- ALL THE CONTACT TRACING RESOURCES WE ARE ALSO ALLOCATING AS FAR AS TRAINING FOR SCHOOLS HAVING A PORTAL FOR SHARING OF INFORMATION WHEN THERE ARE CASES IN SCHOOL SETTINGS AS WELL AS- HAVING A VIRTUAL ROVING TEAM AT SCHOOL INVESTIGATORS IF NEEDED IF LOCAL APARTMENTS NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR THIS VERY MUCH A LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENT ROLE. TO WORK CLOSELY WITH OUR SCHOOLS AND- AND THERE'S YOU KNOW WE DEAL WITH BOTH LOCAL AND STATE PUBLIC HEALTH HOW PROVIDE ALL KINDS OF ASSISTANT RELATED TO OTHER. INFECTIONS IN SCHOOL THE SETTINGS ALL THE TIME AND WORK CLOSELY WITH THEIR SCHOOLS IN THE SETTINGS OF THIS IS JUST YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THAT'S THERE ARE MORE HER THE INFECTION THAT PEOPLE ARE GOING TO BE WORRIED ABOUT AND FOLLOWING UP ON THAT THESE RELATIONSHIPS EXIST ON A LOCAL LEVEL. AND A LOT OF- CLOSE WORK WITH SCHOOL DISTRICT. IS HAPPENING AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IF YOU ARE JUST GOING TO SEE IF CALLING. OR CD WITH ABLE TO AFTER THAT. AS WELL. ABOUT THE L. A. R. I THINK I WOULD JUST SAY. IF YOU CAN WITH WITH ANY OF THE THINGS THAT WE ARE PRESENTATION I THINK WE TRIED TO HIGHLIGHT. THE FACT THAT LOTS OF THE DECISIONS ARE MADE IT MADE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I THINK WE RECOGNIZE THAT IF YOU WANTED TO GET SOME MORE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE. THAT WOULD BE A LITTLE BIT MORE CONCRETE FOR DISTRICTS YOU DO END UP IN SITUATIONS WHERE FOR MANY DISTRICTS THAT BECOMES. MORE OF A CHALLENGE IN IMPLEMENTING. SOME FOR EXAMPLE MAY NOT NOT HAVE THE FACILITIES BASE TO KEEP. A KID THAT'S GOOD PART. IT'S AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. THAT THAT THAT YOU ALL OF. ME TO THINK THEY'RE GOING TO BE ONE OF THE STATE IN TERMS OF FIGURE OUT WHAT THE BEST WAYS TO OPEN BUT I THINK WE- IT. IT'S IT MISTER THEY'RE WALKING. CONTINUE CONSTANT MONITORING AND EVEN IF THERE WAS MORE SPECIFIC ITEMS. I NEED TO CONSTANTLY MONITOR REVIEW AND SEE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE TO. MAKE SURE THAT THINGS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED- AS AS- THE LAPSES YOU THINK SHOULD HAVE BEEN. THE GREAT FAN I JUST WOULD LIKE TO. THAT OUR- TROOPER. HAS CAN. PEOPLE LOOKING RE OPENING THAT INCLUDES OUR LARGEST CITIES LIKE SAN FRANCISCO AND LA AND TO FOCUS ON DETECTING TRACING AND PP AVAILABILITY ALL AS PART OF EFFORTS TO GET SCHOOLS OPEN. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT HAS BEEN ON HE STARTED A LAST WEEK A WITH THE BIG CITY MAYORS AND BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT WE MUST WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT OUR SCHOOL CAN OPEN SAFELY. THE SUPER TECHNOLOGIST AGAIN URGE YOU TO INCORPORATE- TESTING INTO THOSE CONVERSATIONS I THINK IT'S VERY CRITICAL. AS I'M HEARING FROM FROM MY DISTRICTS AND FROM. MY TEACHERS BUT I THINK IT'S EXTRAORDINARILY IMPORTANT THAT THERE ARE. BECOME SOME GREATER. RAIDER GUIDANCE AROUND TESTING JUST BECAUSE THERE IS THERE IS REAL FEAR BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TELLING EVERYONE TO STAY HOME. AND WE HAVE A GROUP OF ESSENTIAL WORKERS WHO HAVE BEEN ASKED TO GO TO WORK AND WE SEEM WITH THEIR INFECTION RATES ARE SO I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND AS WORKERS ARE BEING ASKED TO LEAVE THEIR HOMES AND GO INTO A WORKPLACE ENVIRONMENT- THEY'RE LOOKING FOR GUIDANCE AND GUIDELINES THAT PROVIDE THEM- WORKPLACE SAFETY SO I THINK IT'S TOTALLY REASONABLE EXPECTATION AND I HOPE THAT YOU ALL. THE CORPORATE THAT INTO YOUR- INTO YOUR- DIALOGUE CORRECT GO BACK TO DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ON THE QUESTION MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH LAST. WHICH IS. TESTING TEACHERS WE'VE MADE A SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHICH THIS COMMITTEE. SIGNED OFF ON TO INCREASE TESTING INFRASTRUCTURE- THAT WAS WHEN THE QUESTIONS WE ASKED- HERE MISS POSNER WAS SIGNED OFF ON THESE LETTERS. SO WE ROLL WHAT. WHAT KIND OF TESTING IS GOING TO GET SET ASIDE FOR. TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS. JUST HOMES DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- SO I'M I'M NOT I'M NOT FAMILIAR WITH WHAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO. MAYBE A BETTER QUESTION FOR- ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN OUR HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES UNIT- HOWEVER I CAN SPEAK TO THE PERKINS ON OUR CONTRACT- THAT- DOCTOR UPON RECENTLY REFERRED TO AND- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THEY'RE WITHIN THAT CONTRACT I KNOW THAT THE PRIORITY IS FOR. I'M LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES- TESTING. SINCE THERE WOULD BE SOME- LEVEL OF PRIDE THAT THAT IS WHAT I'M REFERRING TO IS THAT- I APOLOGIZE I FORGOT THE ORGANIZATIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S NAME. BUT THE- THE CONTRACTS THAT THERE WOULD BE SOME LEVEL OF PRIORITY FOR- PEOPLE WHO WORK IN EDUCATION BERMAN. ABSOLUTELY AND I BELIEVE IT'S DOCTOR UPON TO BE TO GET INTO SPECIFICS BUT CERTAINLY- LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES HAVE THE PRIORITY WITHIN THAT CONTRACT. THANK YOU I FOR ONE LAST QUESTION FOR THE DOCTOR POND- AND FEEL FREE IF YOU WANNA LAUGH RATE ON THAT LAST QUESTION WITH HEAR YOUR RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM LONG BEACH. WHICH WHICH IS- YOU YOU YOU HAVE OUR SCHOOLS ARE NOT O BE OPEN FOR ALL STUDENTS WITH THE COUNTIES IN THE RED TIER. CAN CAN YOU WALK US THROUGH HOW YOU DETERMINED- THAT TEAR WOULD BE. SORT OF. OR JUST BE BASED YOU KNOW WHAT'S WHAT WAS THE REASONING BEHIND BEHIND CHOOSING THAT TEAR PERSON ANOTHER TEAR. SURE AND JUST TO QUICKLY RESPOND YOUR OTHER QUESTION AGAIN TO YOU KNOW AS I EARLIER MENTIONED. AND AS FAR AS OUR TESTING TEST SCORES AND THE NEW- BRANCH LAB FOR THE STATE DEPARTMENT OUR SCHOOLS OUR ABSOLUTE PRIORITY AND AS I MENTIONED WE ARE WORKING CLOSELY AGAIN WITH. EDDIE PRACTITIONERS FROM LABOR AND MANAGEMENT- AND THE BOARD OF EDUCATION AND ADMINISTRATION FOR- THE TESTING RESOURCES AFRICAN ONLINE ABSOLUTELY WAS- AS FAR AS DOUBLING ARCTIC POLICY ONE THAT PRIORITIES IS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE TESTING IN SCHOOLS. FOR THE PARTIES I MENTIONED AS FAR AS OF THE RED TEARS SO. IT WAS A COMBINATION OF LOOKING AT SORT OF BASICALLY CASE ATES AND TEST POSITIVITY SO OUR PRIOR. FUNNY DATA MONITORING LIST WHAT WHAT WE HAD IN THE SUMMER AND IN JULY WE FIRST HAVE THAT RE OPENING FRAMEWORK. WE HAD ALSO SAID THAT A SCHOOL COULD REOPEN AFTER TWO WEEKS OFF OF NOT MONITORING THIS AND- THAT SORT OF GENERAL CUT OFF AT THAT LEVEL OR- A CASE RATE OVER SEVEN AND A TEST POSITIVITY OVER. CENTER SO A LOT IS ABOUT THAT WE DO NOT AS WIDESPREAD COMMITTEE TRANSMISSION. AND OF COURSE THERE'S A HUGE SPECTRUM ABOVE THAT IT COULD BE RIGHT AT THE BORDER OR COULD BE WAY OFF OF THAT SO WE DID SAY. JUST SORT OF BACKING INTO THAT AS WELL THAT AN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL. THE TIMES THEY OPEN AT THE LOWER END OF THAT. AND THAT ONE'S- COUNTY WAS IN A STABLE RANGE AND NOT READ TEAR OR A- PRIOR TO THE FLOOR PLAN WHEN IT WAS JUST OFF ACCOUNTED IN A MINDLESS. YOU'RE OFTEN IN THAT RANGE OF THE- THE RED TEAR THAT RANGE OF CASE THREE AND TEST POSITIVITY AND YOUR STABLE FOR AT LEAST TWO WEEKS OF THAT AT. A LEVEL TWO. ARE CONSIDERING OPENING. THANK YOU JUST A JUST FOLLOW UP. ON THE PREVIOUS QUESTION I THINK IT'S AN FOR AS- WE TO YOU KNOW INCREASE OUR TESTING CAPACITY THE THAT AMOUNT OF. FOR TEN NUMBER YOU KNOW RANGE OF TEST NUMBERS GET COMMUNICATED TO THE DISTRICTS STATEWIDE THEY CAN HAVE SOME LEVEL OF EXPECTATION HOW MANY- TESTING MIGHT HAVE ACCESS TO I MEAN AGAIN THIS IS A VERY CENTRAL ISSUE IS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT- KEEP TEACHERS FROM GOING BACK SO I THINK IF THERE. IS AN EXPECTATION THAT IT'S I DON'T KNOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND TESTS ARE MILLION TESTS OR TEN MILLION WHATEVER THE NUMBER IS ON I THINK THAT WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL SO IT'S NOT AN ABSTRACT WE HAVE. TEST AVAILABLE I MEAN DISTRICTS DISTRICTS HAVE X. NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES INDEX NUMBER OF STUDENTS THEY I THINK THEY REALLY NEED TO KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO JUST ARE THEY ONLY GONNA GET LIKE. FIVE THOUSAND TIMES PER DISTRICT OR THIS CAN BE A LOT. Là MORE SORT REALLY TRYING TO HAVE A NUMERIC. RANGE OF WHAT MIGHT BE POSSIBLE AND OBVIOUSLY THAT CHANGES AS WE RAMP IT UP. BUT AS YOU KNOW I THINK WOULD BE VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU- I KNOW I HAVE MORE QUESTIONS WELL BUT I'M GONNA HOLD OFF BECAUSE I THINK WE GOT TO A LOT AND WE HAVE ONE MORE PANEL. WHICH YOU REALLY WANT TO HEAR FROM. LOCALS MISTER THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND I JUST CAN I JUST MAKE ONE WANT ONE JUST ONE QUICK STATEMENT AND I THINK IT. IS REALLY HE DIDN'T SAY IT BUT I THINK HE- HE SEES IT. AND PROBABLY THE WAY I DO- WE HAVE A GLARING CIVIL RIGHTS ISSUE EMERGING IN THE STATE IN THAT. PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE OPENING AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE NOT. MORE VETTING ON A VACCINE WHAT WE SHOULD PROBABLY DO IS BE MUCH BETTER PREPARED FOR THIS TO BE AROUND FOR SOME TIME AND GET TESTING INDOOR SCHOOLS THAT WE CAN SOMEWHAT. ATTEMPT TO CONTROL THAT ENVIRONMENT BUT THIS IS I THINK THE CONVERSATION YOU'RE HEARING TODAY THE TOPIC I JUST MENTIONED IT IS I THINK. EVERYBODY I WATCH IT BECAUSE IT'S COMMON. YEAH CONVERSELY I'M SORRY CAN I ADD TO THAT BECAUSE I WAS THE ONLY WOMAN ON THIS PANEL I WILL SAY WE KNOW THAT WOMEN ARE BEING DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED BY CHILDREN STAYING HOME TO WERE DROPPING ON THE WORK FORCE TO LARGER NUMBERS IT'S BECAUSE- IT'S- I KNOW. IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GET UP HERE TO DO MY JOB- AND WE HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN OUR JOBS. SO AND I KNOW INFECTS FATHERS TO BED BUT MOTHERS IN PARTICULAR AND WE HAVE SPENT MORE TIME AND WE HAD I THINK CLEAR GUIDANCE ON BARS AND MOVIE THEATRES THAN WE HAVE ON SCHOOLS. WHAT IS ACTUALLY GOING TO BE AVAILABLE FOR THE SCHOOLS THE TESTING WITHOUT SPECIFIC GUIDELINES OR CLEAR GUIDELINES I THINK WHAT'S HAPPENING IS LIKE WE'RE TALKING OF COURSE WHAT I THINK THAT SOUNDS GREAT. BUT IF IT'S NOT REQUIRED THEN WE HAVE SOME SCHOOLS THAT ARE OPENING UP SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPENING UP WITHOUT ANY TYPE OF- JUST MASKS BASICALLY THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED A VISTA UNIFIED. AND THEN EVERYBODY IN THE SURROUNDING. AREA T. PARENTS ARE THINKING OH MY GOD THAT YOU CAN OPEN UP LIKE THAT I DON'T WANT MY SCHOOL TO OPEN UP LIKE THAT SO. WE JUST HAVEN'T BEEN VERY CLEAR WITH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS WE HAVE BEEN CLEAR WITH THEIR TEACHERS. WE'RE NOT SAYING HOW MUCH WE'RE GOING TO- PROVIDE AS FAR AS TESTING- IF COHORTS ARE GONNA KEEP KIDS SAFE THAN REQUIRE COHORTS BUT LIKE LET'S. LET'S BE CLEAR SO KIDS CAN GO BACK TO SCHOOL I THINK RIGHT NOW WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE CREATING THE PERFECT STORM. WHERE PRIVATE SCHOOLS CAN FIGURE IT OUT THEY'VE ENOUGH MONEY TO FIGURE IT OUT. WE HAVE SOME PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE JUST GO IN. LIKE THE WILD WEST IN AND RUNNING INTO PROBLEMS AND THOSE ARE THE STORIES WERE SEEN AND SO. IT'S PREVENTING EVERYBODY ELSE WHO REALLY NEEDS THAT TO GET BACK THESE BIGGER SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO I JUST I IMPLORE- THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. AND I KNOW CITIES TRYING TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE THEY DON'T HAVE THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE CLEAR WITH THE SCHOOL DISTRICT SO THAT THEY CAN HAVE A REAL OPEN PLAN IT'S OUR KIDS. BACK TO SCHOOL. THAT'S ALL THAT'S MY- MOTHERLY PLEASE I THANK AMEN AND ALL THIS FURTHER WHAT I SAID IN THE INTRO JUST AYE. I WENT OVER THAT QUICKLY BUT- THERE ARE A DOZEN OR SO. MAJOR DISTRICTS HERE. IN SACRAMENTO ON THE DEED A STORY JUST TWO DAYS AGO. AND LITERALLY HALF ARE ON THEIR WAY TO RE OPENING. AND THOSE ARE THE HALF OF THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE THE LOWEST NUMBER. OF FREE OR REDUCED LUNCH GETS. SO THE FAMILIES. THAT ARE ESSENTIAL WORKERS. THAT YOU KNOW HAVE SOME. YOU KNOW IT'S- GREAT STRUGGLE IN AND MAKING IT ALL WORK FOR THEIR- THEIR KIDS ARE THE ONES THAT AREN'T. AREN'T DOING WHAT THE WITH THE PRIVATE SCHOOLS ARE DOING SOME NOT SO THERE'S ALL KINDS OF PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES. ON THE WERE ALL IN THE SAME. REGION AS WELL SO AS FAR AS PURPLE AND ORANGE AND RED. BUT A REALITY THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE OPENING. I ESSENTIALLY. OPENING JUST LIKE A PRIVATE SCHOOL SO. THERE IS A HAVE AND HAVE NOT. EQUATION THERE RIGHT HERE LOCALLY. SO WITH THAT WE WENT TO NOW GET TO OUR- SECOND PANEL WE'RE GOING TO START WITH THE SAN DIEGO. COUNTY OFFICE OF ED IN HERE FROM. THERE COUNTY SUPERINTENDENT. DR PAUL- GOT HOLD. THE SECRET MAYBE. MY HAVE. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN MCCARTY. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN CHAIRMAN PARTY MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE AND IN PARTICULAR. ASSEMBLY WOMAN GONZALEZ FLETCHER THANKYOU FOR YOUR CONTINUED SUPPORT LEADERSHIP AND OUR REGION. IN AN EFFORT TO TRY NOT TO. BE REDUNDANT SOME OF THE FOLKS THAT HAVE GONE BEFORE US SAID I FIRST OF ALL JUST WANT TO. THANK THE COMMITTEE AND I THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR COMMITTEE TO PUBLIC EDUCATION HOLD HARMLESS- DURING THE TIME THAT THIS WAS IN QUESTION TO HAVE TO GO THROUGH BUDGET CUTS REDUCTIONS POTENTIAL LAYOFFS ALONG WITH NAVIGATING. THE PANDEMIC WOULD HAVE BEEN EXTRAORDINARY IT'S BEEN CHALLENGING ENOUGH WE'VE EXPERIENCED LOSS IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND- I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMITMENT. TO IT TO GIVE US TIME TO ADJUST TO IT IT IS SO MUCH APPRECIATED THE LOCAL LEVEL- AS OF TODAY WE HAVE THIRTY THREE OF OUR FORTY TWO DISTRICTS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. OPEN TO SOME OR IN PERSON INSTRUCTION WHETHER THAT'S THROUGH ITINERANT SERVICES WITH SPECIAL LEAD APPOINTMENTS- IT FOR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS. OR HYBRID SCHEDULES- BUT IN IN MOST CASES- WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY. EIGHTY TWO TO EIGHTY SIX THOUSAND KIDS IN OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS DISTRICT SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW ON CAMPUSES AS WE SPEAK WE HAVE SEVEN ADDITINAL UP APPROXIMATELY TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. IN OUR CHARTER SCHOOL CAMPUSES. AND AS OF LAST WEE WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH OUR- OF FOLKS IT AT THE COUNTY- HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES AND PUBLIC HEALTH. REPORTED THIRTY NINE CASES OF KOBE NINETEEN WITH POTENTIAL SCHOOL BASED EXPOSURE IN THE PREVIOUS TWO WEEKS. THIS DOES NOT MEAN THAT THOSE CASES WERE CONTRACTED AT SCHOOL. THE VAST MAJORITY WERE CONTRACTED OUTSIDE OF SCHOOL BUT MOST RECENTLY WE ARE AWARE OF TWO OUTBREAKS IN OUR- IN OUR SCHOOLS IN IN BOTH OF THOSE SITUATIONS- THESE WERE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE THE GUIDELINES. OF MASKS DISTANCING WERE NOT FOLLOWED A STAFF PARTY- WITH A POTLUCK WITHOUT MASKS. ANNA IN THE EXPERIENCE THAT- GONZALEZ FLETCHER TOOK YOU WAITED EARLIER- WHEN IT COMES TO STAFF TESTING WE'VE BEEN VERY FORTUNATE. TO HAVE- OUR PUBLIC ART OUR BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SUPPORT TESTING. THEIR FORTY TWO TESTING CENTERS ACROSS THIS COUNTY- FIVE OF THOSE CENTERS HAVE BEEN DEDICATED EXCLUSIVELY. FOR STAFF EMPLOYEES- AND THEY MADE THE COMMITMENT TO TEST- EXACTLY WHAT THE CDPH GUIDELINES STATE THAT'S 50% OF. ALL SCHOOL EMPLOYEES EACH MONTH FOR A 100% EVERY TWO MONTHS- ASSUMING EVERY SCHOOL OR OPENNESS ANY OF COUNTY THAT'S WE HAVE OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND SCHOOL EMPLOYEES. ACROSS OUR COUNTY AND THOSE TESTS ARE ARE. TYPICALLY A HUNDRED DOLLARS EACH. I ARE ARE COUNTY HEALTH WAS ABLE TO. THAT RATE WITH YOU LOOKS DOWN TO FIFTY FOR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES THREE FIFTY DOLLARS TESTING FORTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES A MONTH IS- AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPENSE WE ARE FORTUNATE. THAT THEY MADE THAT COMMITMENT TO OUR SCHOOL EMPLOYEES IN THIS REGION AND WE ARE NOT A- RESPONSIBLE FOR PAYING FOR THAT. I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT JUST RE OPENING SCHOOLS I THINK YOU CAN'T TALK ABOUT REOPENING SCHOOLS WITHOUT. WHAT ARE THE KIDS ARE IN OUR PARENTS OF FAMILIES HAVE GONE THROUGH WE HAD TO SPEND. A LOT OF TIME ON JUST ZERO G. AND SAFETY MEASURES CREATING VIDEOS TO MAKE SURE THAT IT'S THE PARENTS AND STUDENTS. UNDERSTOOD THE DYNAMICS WHEN COMING BACK TO SCHOOL AND WHAT THOSE THINGS MEANT- WE ALSO CREATED A BANK OF RESOURCES TO TALK ABOUT RACE AND SOME OF THE ISSUES. THAT HAVE GONE ON WITHIN OUR COMMUNITIES. WE CAN'T JUST BRING THE KIDS BACK AND DIVE DIRECTLY INTO THE ACADEMICS BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY- WHAT WERE THE WHAT WERE THE THINGS GOING ON IN THEIR RESPECTIVE COMMUNITIES. THAT WE COULD BEST SUPPORT THEM WHEN THEY COME BACK TO SCHOOL AND HOW COULD WE PROVIDE SUPPORT TO TEACHERS AND ADULTS IN THOSE SITUATIONS. ONE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WHEN YOU FOLLOW THE HEALTH GUIDELINES. YOU THERE'S NO WAY WE SAID THIS BACK IN MARCH WE IMMEDIATELY WENT INTO RECOVERY YOU CANNOTBRING BACK MOR THAN THE SAME TIME. AND WITH THAT COMES YEAR AM PM SESSIONS YOUR HYBRID SCHEDULES. AND IMAGINE AN EDUCATOR WHO HAS CHILDREN OF THEIR OWN. COMING BACK TO REPORT ON CAMPUS DEVELOPING. LESSON BANKS. THE KIDS HAVE TO ACCESS ONLINE BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY. WHAT HAPPENS WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN WHEN THE SCHOOLS ARE ONLY OPEN HALF DAY OUR KIDS ARE GOING TO SCHOOL TO THREE DAYS A WEEK. AS A COUNTY OFFICE WE PROVIDE EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS DIRECTLY TO OUR KIDS WHO ARE INCARCERATED. COMMUNITY SCHOOLS HOMELESS FOSTER YOUTH WE ACTUALLY HAD TO BUILD IN CHILDCARE STIPENDS. TO SUPPORT. OUR OWN TEACHERS AND CLASSIFIED STAFF COMING BACK TO WORK. BECAUSE THERE IS NOT. THE ACCESSIBILITY EVEN AFTER FULLY UTILIZING AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. FOR KIDS. TO BE TO GET THAT CHILD CARE THE WHOLE DAY. ONE OF THE OTHER UNINTENDED ANY THINGS THAT WE'VE BEEN- DO WE HAVE WE SET UP SEVERAL TASK FORCES. FOR MOST VULNERABLE KIDS ONE OF THOSE BEEN IMMIGRATION TASK FORCE. AND SINCE MARCH WE HAVE FORTY NINE THOUSAND AMERICAN BORN STUDENTS LIVING NOW IN BAJA CALIFORNIA ALONE. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE CHILDREN ARE FROM CALIFORNIA. AND THE VAST MAJORITY OF THOSE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN ARE FROM SAN DIEGO WE ESTIMATE ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND KIDS WE DON'T KNOW WILL COME BACK WEEK 80% THE JOBS LOST IN OUR REGION OUR TOURISM RETAIL. HIGHER EDUCATION PRIVATE SCHOOLS SO WE ARE ACTUALLY IN THE PROCESS OF BUILDING A BI NATIONAL SCHOOL WHERE KIDS CAN GET A DIPLOMA THAT'S BOTH GOOD IN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES TO SUPPORT OUR KIDS BUT I CANNOT IMAGINE AFTER THE HOLD HARMLESS. EXPIRES WHAT THE FISCAL CLIFF COULD LOOK LIKE NOT JUST FROM A BUDGETARY STANDPOINT BUT ALSO FROM. A LOSS OF EIGHTY A- BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT MANY OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE HAVE LEFT ARE ARE NOT PRESIDING RIGHT NOW IN CALIFORNIA. THEY PREVIOUSLY DID SO I WILL TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE DIGITAL DIVIDE WE HAVE PICNIC MADE INCREDIBLE STRIDES AND HOW WE'RE LOOKING AT THIS IS A BASIC RIGHT JUST LIKE POWER. LIKE WATER ELECTRICITY AND EVEN IF IN A SITUATION WHERE STUDENTS ARE NOW GOING TO BE BACK AT SCHOOL IT IS IMPORTANT MORE THAN EVER A 100% OF THEM ARE CONNECTED. BECAUSE MANY OF THOSE ACTIVITIES WILL STILL CONTINUE IN A VIRTUAL ENVIRONMENT. IN IN MARCH WHEN WE DID A NEEDS ASSESSMENT OF OUR COUNTY. OVER ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS WERE UNDER CONNECTED WE HAVE FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SO ROUGHLY ONE OUT OF FIVE KIDS. AS WE WORK THROUGH THE SITUATION GIVE A COUPLE EXAMPLES OF HOW WE'VE BEEN TREATING. OUR SCHOOLS THAT HAVE OPENED WE HAVE A UGH OUR COUNTY OFFICE. OF HEALTH HAS A CONTACT TRACING TEAM THAT'S DEDICATED TO K. TWELVE EDUCATION- WHEN THEY'VE EXPERIENCED A SOMEONE WHO HAS. BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO TESTED POSITIVE. THE PRESS THE SUPERINTENDENT IS ALERTED. THE PRINCIPAL CLASSROOM SHUTS DOWN. FOR TWO WEEKS IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION THE KIDS BY TEN THIRTY AFTER PICKING UP MATERIALS PIVOT INTO DISTANCE LEARNING FOR FOURTEEN DAYS. RESUME BACK ON CAMPUS. THE VAST MAJORITY OF OUR DISTRICTS HAVE BEEN VERY SUCCESSFUL WITH THE RE OPENING PLANS WHEN FOLLOWING. THE GUIDELINES SET FORTH BY THE STATE WITH MASKS DISTANCING. VENTILATION AND REALLY JUST THE SPIRIT INTENT OF WHAT THAT IS SUPPOSED TO DO AND THAT'S KEEP. SMALLER GROUPS OF KIDS ON CAMPUS AT A TIME I ONCE AGAIN WANT TO JUST THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR ALL OF YOUR SUPPORT. WE MET HAD. A NUMBER OF SITUATIONS WE'VE HAD TO- WE LIKE THE TEST KITCHEN I GUESS IN IN SAN DIEGO HAVE BEEN OPENED FIRST BUT NOW THE SUPPORT WE'VE RECEIVED FROM CVS AND OUR OUR LAWMAKERS IS EXTRAORDINARY. THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME- PRESENT TODAY AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. OKAY THANK YOU WILL CERTAINLY COME BACK TO YOU NEXT WE HAVE. BILL SIMMONS THE PRESIDENT OF THE SAN JUAN TEACHERS ASSOCIATION BELIEVE DOWN HERE IN THE CAPITAL ROOM ONE TWENTY SEVEN. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. HI GOOD AFTERNOON GO HEAD. THANK YOU- I'M BUILT THEM IN A SIXTH GRADE ENGLISH AND HISTORY TEACHER AND PRESIDENT OF THE FAN ONE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF EDUCATIONAL PRACTITIONERS. PRACTITIONERS CAME INTO EDUCATION BECAUSE THEY CARE ABOUT STUDENTS AND WANT THEM TO LEARN AND GROW. ALL OF US WANT TO BE WITH OUR STUDENTS. WHEN IT IF THEY- UNTIL THEN WE HAVE ACCEPTED THE CHALLENGE THAT THIS PANDEMIC HAS CREATED AND WE ARE WORKING TIRELESSLY TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS IN A VIRTUAL CONTACT. PUTTING IN TEN TO TWELVE HOUR DAYS TO GET IT ALL DONE. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT SOME OF THE THINGS ARE ASSOCIATION IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAS DONE TO PLAN FOR CALL RE OPENING. WE LEARNED A LOT FROM LISTENING TO STUDENT. AMYLASE AND STAFF ABOUT THEIR CHALLENGES FROM THE SPRING AND USE THAT FEEDBACK TO IMPROVE DISTANCE LEARNING FOR THE FALL. THERE ARE SEVERAL APPS ACTIONS THAT WE TOOK. WE JOINTLY SELECTED PRACTITIONERS TO DEVELOP A BANKABLE THAN FOCUSING A CENTRAL FAN. THANKS OF STANDARDS ARE THE POWER STANDARDS IN EACH GRADE LEVEL AND CONTENT AREA. THE LESSONS WERE PUT INTO A LESSON BANK THAT COULD EITHER SERVE TO SUPPORT A FLIPPED CLASSROOM OR TO BE USED AS MODEL LESSONS TO LEARN FROM. WE WERE ALSO ABLE TO AGREE UPON A DEFINITION OF THE SYNCHRONOUS TIME. AND CRAFTED OUR AGREEMENT TO ALLOW PRACTITIONERS. CHANGE DESIGN THEIR SCHEDULE TO MEET THE NEEDS OF EACH OF THEIR STUDENTS. THE SCHEDULES WERE MEANT TO BE RESPONSES. AND FLEXIBLE JEFF AS WE WOULD BE IF WE WERE IN PERSON. TO ALLOW TEACHERS TO MOVE BETWEEN THE WHOLE GROUP INSTRUCTION. SMALL GROUP SUPPORT AND ONE ON ONE INTERVENTION. ELEMENTARY STUDENTS ALSO HAVE TIME EACH WEEK WITH A MUSIC R. P. OR FINANCE SPECIALIST IN ADDITION TO TIME WITH THE CLASSROOM TEACHERS. OUR AGREEMENT ALL THE LAYERS AND MORE SUPPORT FOR STUDENTS WHO NEED MORE. IN ADDITION TO TIME WITH THE CLASSROOM TEACHER ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS RECEIVE THIRTY MINUTES OF DESIGNATED BLT INSTRUCTION EACH DAY. STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS RECEIVE THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THEY REQUIRE. SUCH AS SPEECH AND ADAPTIVE PETE. WITH ADDITIONAL LEARNING NEEDS SUCH AS RESOURCE SUPPORT OR INTERVENTION ARE PROVIDED THE SERVICES LIKE EITHER THE CLASSROOM TEACHER ABOVE AND BEYOND THE REQUIRED MINUTES FOR ALL STUDENTS. OR MAYBE PROVIDED BY A SPECIALIST IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CLASSROOM TEACHER. ALSO OUR AGREEMENTS CREATE THE OPPORTUNITY FOR A SOCIAL WORKER OR COUNSELOR TO ADDRESS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS THAT OUR STUDENTS ARE EXPERIENCING. THESE PROFESSIONALS ALSO WITH THIS FAMILY IN SECURING RESOURCES SUCH AS TECHNOLOGY. WHO ARE HOUSING. THE SAME ONE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND THE SAN JUAN UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT ALSO JOINTLY RECOGNIZED THE NEED TO ALLOW EVERY STUDENT AND FAMILY OPTIONS TO MEET THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS THIS SUMMER WE EXPANDED OUR HOME SCHOOL AND INDEPENDENT STUDY PROGRAMS TO MEET PARENTAL REQUESTS FOR A CHOICE OF EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS. OVER ONE THOUSAND STUDENTS HAVE MOVED TO THESE OPTIONS GIVING PARENTS A CHOICE OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS DURING THIS UNPRECEDENTED TIME. WELL THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE HAVE DONE TO SUPPORT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES DURING DISTANCE LEARNING WE CONTINUE TO THOUGHT TO PLAN FOR A PHASETRANSITION TO IN PERSON SERVICES. WE CREATED WAYS TO ALLOW THE RESUMPTION OF ONE ON ONE ASSISTANCE FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION. THEN WE PERMITTED TO FOCUSING ON BRINGING BACK SMALL GROUPS OF STUDENTS THAT RECEIVE SPECIAL EDUCATION SERVICES. THAT WILL BEGIN ON MONDAY NOVEMBER SECOND. OUR WORK NOW FOCUSES ON RETURNING TO IN PERSON SERVICES OUR YOUNGEST YELL STUDENTS. WHILE AT THE SAME TIME REVAMPING OUR HYBRID PLANT. OUR ORIGINAL PLANS THAT WE DRAFTED IN THE SUMMER ARE NO LONGER VIABLE DUE TO CHANGING GUIDELINES STATE REQUIREMENTS. AND ARE LEARNING FROM THOSE WHO ARE ALREADY OPEN. AS WE SHIFT FURTHER IN PERSON SERVICES WE NEED YOUR HELP. FIRST PLEASE CONSIDER CREATING GUIDELINES FOR THE EDUCATIONAL PROCESS BUT AVOID GETTING INTO THE WE- AS YOU CAN SEE BY PROVIDING US WITH A LOOSE FRAMEWORK OF THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF INSTRUCTIONAL MINUTES. WE WERE ABLE TO MEET THE ACADEMIC NEEDS OF INDIVIDUAL STUDENTS AND ADDRESS SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS IN WAYS THAT WERE RESPONSIVE AND ADAPTABLE. IT ALLOWED US TO USE LOCAL INFORMATION TO DRIVE DECISIONS WHICH IS A MUCH BETTER THAN IF WE WERE CONSTRAINED WITH ONE SIZE FITS ALL REGULATION. IF YOU THINK ABOUT NEXT STEPS PLEASE GIVE LOCAL DISTRICTS AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS THE FLEXIBILITY TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS THAT MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR LOCAL STUDENTS. AND FAMILIES. SECOND PLEASE PROTECT OUR SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION FUNDING FOR THE NEXT SCHOOL YEAR BY CONTINUING WITH THE HOLD HARMLESS APPROACH SAN JUAN HAS CONTINUED TO USE THOSE DOLLARS TO ADDRESS THE ACADEMIC SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS BY INCREASING COUNSELORS NURSES SOCIAL WORKERS AND ACADEMIC INTERVENTION TEACHERS AS YOU KNOW THE INFORMATION SOURCE OF MUCH OF THAT FUNDING OMES FROM FREE AND REDUCED MEAL APPLICATION. DURING THIS PANDEMIC FAMILIES ARE NOT COMPLETING THE APPLICATION TO RECEIVE THE MEALS AS THEY HAVE IN THE PAST. MANY OF THEM ARE FOCUSED ON KEEPING OR SECURING EMPLOYMENT OR HOUSING. THE IMPACT ON DISTRICTS LIKE OURS IS THAT THE APPLICATION COMPLETION RATE IS WAY DOWN. THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS IN NEED HAS NOT DROPPED. WELL THE NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS AND FAMILIES HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED. BUT THE NUMBERS FROM THE FORM COVER UP THAT REALITY. WE NEED YOU TO CONSIDER THE UNINTENTIONAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF DOING BUSINESS AS USUAL DURING THIS UNUSUAL TIME. THIRD PROVIDE US WITH THE NECESSARY FUNDS FOR THE THINGS SCHOOLS DID NOT NEED BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC BEGAN. WE NEED TO SEND THE PRECINCT TESTING CAPACITY. AND CONVENIENT TESTING SITE FOR STUDENTS FAMILIES AND STAFF. I KNOW YOU HAVE SEEN THIS INFOGRAPHIC. REGARDING HEALTH CRITICAL TESTING IS TO CONTROL COVERT NINETEEN. THE CURRENT STATUS OF TESTING IS NOT ACCEPTABLE WE NEED RELIABLE CONSISTENT TESTING TO REDUCE THE RISK OF ANY PERSON SCHOOLING AND STUDENTS AND STAFF SAFE. INCREASES FUNDING FOR THINGS SUCH AS DAILY TEMPERATURE TAKING EFFORT TO HE FIRST TO THE AND- WE NEED RESOURCE FOR MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES TO KEEP SCHOOLS CLEAN AND TO BE ABLE TO ALLOW ALL OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES. SHOULD BE ABLE TO FOLLOW ALL THE HEALTH AND SAFETY GUIDELINES. HELP BUILD CONFIDENCE IN OUR LOCAL SCHOOL COMMUNITIES BY MAKING SURE EVERYONE OVER THE AGE OF TWO IS REQUIRED TO WEAR A MASK. IF YOU NEED A MASK TO GO GROCERY SHOPPING. WE NEED THAT IN SCHOOLS. HELP US TO SUFFICIENTLY RESOURCE MEANINGFUL CONTRACT RACING. THAT ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO DO IT IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT WAY IT TAKES ADDITIONAL PERSONNEL TO DO IT IN A TIMELY AND EFFICIENT WAY. FINALLY PLEASE KNOW THAT WE WANT WHAT WE WANT IS TO BE WITH OUR STUDENTS WE WOULD MEAN THE FIRST ONE IS TO BRING ALL STUDENTS BACK. IF IT WERE STATE. WE CARE ABOUT THE EDUCATIONAL AND SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS OF OUR STUDENTS. AND WE CARE ABOUT THEIR PHYSICAL WELL BEING. WE THINK WE CAN ADDRESS BOTH IF YOU HELP US WITH SUFFICIENT RESOURCES MOVING FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU AND NEXT WE HAVE DOCTORS CORBEAU WITH THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS WHO'S GOING TO BE REMOTE. I REMOTE PARTICIPANT. PLEASE BEGIN THANK YOU. OH SORRY IT WAS A LITTLE TOO LATE FROM THE CAMERA YEAH MY NAME IS JACQUES CORPS OF ON THE PEDIATRIC HOSPITALISTS IN ANTIOCH. AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CALIFORNIA. REPRESENTING OVER FIVE THOUSAND PEDIATRICIANS HERE IN THE STATE- FIRST OF ALL I WANTED TO THANK FELLOW CALIFORNIANS FOR BELIEVING IN MASKS. I THINK I'M CURRENT NATIONAL EVENTS HAVE REALLY SHOWN THAT MASKS TO WORK. AND REALLY WE'RE HERE HAVING THIS CONVERSATION AND ABLE TO DO THIS BECAUSE OF THAT HAS CALIFORNIA PEDIATRICIANS WE'VE ASKED THE STATE AND DINNER OF FELLOW PARENTS AND TEACHER COLLEAGUES TO REALLY. IRA TIES- EARLY EDUCATION AND YOUNG LEARNERS TO BE AN IN PERSON IT'S GOING- PARTICULARLY FOR OUR YOUNG LEARNERS THERE'S LESS SERVED BY DISTANCE LEARNING. AND MORE IMPACTED BY DISCIPLINE LEARNING. THE IMPACT OF COVE IT IN THE IN INTENDED AND ATTENDANT MITIGATION. HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY. DEVASTATING TO A LOT OF CHILDREN- WE'RE SEEING COMPOUNDING INEQUITY HUNGER VIOLENCE- INCREASING BECAUSE OF THIS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE- THE SOCIAL ISOLATION AND LONELINESS ON OUR TEENS. IS JUST AS IN THE LAST COUNT TURN INCREASING THE RISK OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY PTSD. IT PEDIATRICIANS- TAKE SAFETY. VERY SERIOUSLY AND WITH THE UTMOST CONSIDERATION OF SAFETY OUR NATIONAL ORGANIZATION STRONGLY RECOMMENDED. THE GOAL OF HAVING STUDENTS PHYSICALLY PRESENT IN SCHOOL- AS THE PRIMARY GOAL FOR RE OPENING. IF THE LONG IT YOU KNOW SO FOR- OUR STATE COLLEAGUES CALIFORNIA PEDIATRICIANS WE FURTHER STATED THAT THE STATE AND TO SHOULD BE PRIORITIZING OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND- I A DON'T SEE HOW. T. K. AND KINDERGARTEN IN THE REMOTE LEARNING ENVIRONMENT. ALL SERVICE ANY OF THE EDUCATIONAL GOALS. ANY OF THE- TRAINING THAT TEACHERS GET TO TEACH THE SOCIAL EMOTIONAL SKILLS THAT THAT CHILDREN NEED TO HAVE FURTHER SUCCESS IN EDUCATION IN LIFE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION HAS BEEN SHOWN TO IMPROVE THE LIFELONG HEALTH- EDUCATIONALIST HAIN MEANT- OF PLACEMENT OPPORTUNITIES. OF CHILDREN AS A THE APPROACH ADULTHOOD- WE CAN'T AFFORD TO MISS THESE OPPORTUNITIES FOR A GENERATION. IN ADDITION TO YOUNG LEARNERS WE ALSO ASK THE STATEMENT TEACHER COLLEAGUES TO. PRIORITIZE SPECIAL EDUCATION. CHILDREN WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES- ADHD OUR PARTICULARLY LESS SERVED BY DISTANCE LEARNING AS WELL AND REALLY SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED FOR IN PERSON LEARNING. AND AS I SAID WE DON'T TAKE THE SAFETY LATELY- I WANT TO GIVE SPECIAL THANKS TO UCSF MEDICARE'S COLLABORATIVE FUND ON REOPENING. AND IN PARTICULAR DR NAOMI BARDOCK BECAUSE THIS IS BEEN. A INTELLECTUAL AND EMOTIONAL JOURNEY. FOR PEDIATRICIANS. WE WERE RIGHT TO CLOSE EVERYTHING DOWN THE BEGINNING- INCLUDING SCHOOLS- BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE WITH AND FOR ONCE- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO. GO VERY FAR TO SEE CHILDREN SPREADING INFLUENZA. BLAKELY HAD AND THEN SOME DATASETS HALF OF. CASES OF INFLUENCE ARE SPREAD BY YOUNG CHILDREN. D. I DON'T NEED TO. TELL A TEACHER OR PARENT THAT HE WE ALL WE ALL- SEE THAT FIVE YEAR OLD RUNNING AROUND WITH THE RAIN KNOWS AND THEN. COMING TO GIVE YOU A HUG AND COFFEE. IN YOUR FACE. AND SO AS THE DATA IS BUILT AS THE AS THE DATE HAS COME OUT ON. OUTBREAKS INFECTIONS- MAKES VARIANCES WITH OTHER COUNTRIES RE OPENING SCHOOLS BOUGHT. THE PANDEMIC. IT WAS VERY DIFFICULT FOR PEDIATRICIANS TO ACCEPT THAT THE CHILDREN PARTICULARLY YOUNG CHILDREN IN ELEMENTARY AID VERY MUCH LESS LIKELY TO SPREAD THIS INFECTION THERE'S EVEN CASE REPORTS WHERE- A CHILD. ELEMENTARY AGE CHILD COMES TO SCHOOL EXPOSES HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE NOBODY WEARING MASKS. AND IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IS CHILD ALSO HAD INFLUENCES SIX PEOPLE GOT INFLUENCE SIX. ADULTS AND CHILDREN GOT INFLUENZA NOBODY GOT COVERT WE- HAVE SUBSEQUENTLY YOU KNOW FOUND IT'S NOT THAT CHILDREN DON'T GET CODE IS NOT THAT THEY DON'T SPREAD CODED TO JUST NOT VERY GOOD AT. AND MASKS WORK- THE CALIFORNIA'S BEEN FANTASTIC IN IN REALLY THE MALTA SAN INTERVENTIONS THAT THAT HELP PREVENT COVERED SPREAD IN SCHOOLS IN OF MASKS SOCIAL DISTANCING HAND HYGIENE AND ALICIA MARKS AND SCHOOLS AND WILL REOPEN SAFELY- WHERE. WELL EITHER. PREVALENCE OR OR OR- FUNDS OR NEGOTIATIONS- MAKE IT DIFFICULT WE REALLY ENCOURAGE THAT AT LEAST PRIORITIZE YOUNGEST LEARNERS. DID FOR THE KINDERGARTNERS. I SHOULD ALSO SAY THE RIVAS HE MENTIONED- IN IN THE PRIOR PANEL THERE IS AN ARTICLE IN THE NEW ENGLAND JOURNAL OF MEDICINE AND ON ON OCTOBER TWENTY FIRST- CALL THE MISSING PIECE I SHOULD NOTE THAT THE AUTHOR TAKES. PERSONAL INCOME FROM BARELY LIFE SCIENCES WHICH IS A GOOGLE SISTER COMPANY THAT SELLS SURVEILLANCE TESTING TO GOVERNMENTS. SO WITH A STRONG RECOMMENDATION FROM. THAT CONFLICT OF INTEREST I SHOULD NOTE THAT BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT. THANK YOU. OKAY THANK YOU OUR FINAL SPEAKER. ED TRUST WEST. RACHEL REPUBLICANS. OKAY. I BELIEVE SHE'S TESTIFIED OKAY HERE WE GO. HI GOOD AFTERNOON. YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND BEGIN. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON I'M SO GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MCCARTY FOR CALLING THIS HEARING MY NAME IS RACHEL REFLOW AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATOR ENGAGEMENT AT THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST AND ALSO FORMER TEACHER SCHOOL ADMINISTRATOR AND LIKE MANY OF YOU I'M A PARENT OF. A CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOLS THIS HAS BEEN A YEAR LIKE NO OTHER AND IT'S SAFE TO SAY THAT SCHOOLS DISTRICTS TEACHERS AND POLICYMAKERS ARE WORKING HARD TO RESPONDTO THE NEEDS OF THE MOMENT. WE AT ED TRUST WEST AND THOSE OF US IN THE EDUCATION EQUITY SPACE ALSO KNOW THAT LONG BEFORE CORONAVIRUS SCHOOL CLOSURES AND DISTANCE LEARNING CALIFORNIA FACED AN EPIDEMIC OF EDUCATION INEQUALITY. IT'S BEEN A SAD REALITY THAT FOR DECADES STUDENTS WHO NEED THE MOST RESOURCES OFTEN GET THE LEAST. WE GIVE STUDENTS OF COLOR AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS THE LEAST ACCESS TO CRITICAL COURSEWORK. HIGHLY QUALIFIED TEACHERS CRUCIAL TECHNOLOGY AND A HOST OF OTHER RESOURCES. WHEN OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR DR ALCIA SMITH ARIANNA FIRST TESTIFIED ABOUT SCHOOL CLOSURES TO THIS COMMITTEE IN APRIL. WE THOUGHT SCHOOL CLOSURES WOULD BE TEMPORARY AND FOR A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME. AND NOW HERE WE ARE HALFWAY THROUGH THE FALL SEMESTER. AND BASED ON A RECENT POLL OF K. TWELVE PARENTS BY ADDRESS WEST WE KNOW THE DISTANCE LEARNING IS NOT WORKING FOR MOST FAMILIES. THE DECISIONS THE CALIFORNIA MAKES RIGHT NOW WILL DETERMINE HOW WE TURN THIS CRISIS INTO AN OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER SERVE ALL STUDENTS. WELL THIS HEARING IS FOCUSED ON THE STATE'S ROLE IN THE SAFE RE OPENING OF SCHOOLS WE URGE THE COMMITTEE AND THE LEGISLATURE TO ALSO KEEP EQUITY CONSIDERATIONS AT THE FOREFRONT. AS WE PLAN FOR AND IMPLEMENT IN PERSON AND HYBRID INSTRUCTIONS. WE MUST REMEMBER THAT THE BEST SOLUTIONS COME FROM THE PEOPLE CLOSEST TO THE PROBLEM. THAT'S WHY ADDRESS WEST CONDUCTED A STATE WIDE PULL ON FAMILY'S EXPERIENCES IN APRIL AND IN OCTOBER. AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD THE PERSPECTIVES OF FAMILIES TO THIS CONVERSATION. IN OUR OCTOBER POLL WE HEARD THAT AT HALF WAY THROUGH THE FALL SEMESTER PARENTS ARE NOT FINDING DISTANCE LEARNING SUCCESSFUL AND THERE ARE CLEAR ISSUES THAT NEED TO BE ADDRESSED AS THE SCHOOL YEAR CONTINUOUS. ONLY 35% OF PARENTS RATE DISTANCE LEARNING AS SUCCESSFUL COMPARED 257% IN OUR APRIL POLL. ADDITIONALLY LOW INCOME PARENTS ARE MORE LIKELY TO RATE DISTANCE LEARNING AS UNSUCCESSFUL. STUDENTS FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND STUDENTS OF COLOR ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE. DISTANCE LEARNING FULL TIME FURTHER LOW INCOME PARENTS AND PARENTS OF COLOR ARE LESS LIKELY TO EVEN HAVE THE OPTION OF FULL TIME IN PERSON LEARNING THAT THEIR CHILD'S SCHOOL IS OFFERING IN PERSON FULL TIME CLASSES WHILE HIGHER INCOME PARENTS REPORT TRIPLE THE ACCESS AT 19% PARENTS AROUND THE STATE ARE SAYING THAT THE DID DIGITAL DIVIDE IS STILL A TOP CONCERN. ALMOST HALF 44% OF PARENTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER THEIR FAMILY WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD INTERNET ACCESS. PARENTS ARE REPORTING THAT THE PANDEMIC IN DISTANCE LEARNING ARE CAUSING HIGHER LEVELS OF STRESS FOR THEM AND THEIR CHILDREN. SIX IN TEN PARENTS SAY THEY ARE VERY CONCERNED. ABOUT ENSURING THAT THEIR CHILD FEEL SAFE EMOTIONALLY AT EASE DURING THIS TIME. THIS HEARING IS COMING AT AN OPPORTUNE TIME THE STATE HAS A CRITICAL ROLE TO PLAY AND HOW WE TURN THIS CRISIS INTO AN OPPORTUNITY. WE HAVE REACHED A POINT NEARLY EIGHT MONTHS INTO THE PANDEMIC WHERE WE MUST BE MORE PROACTIVE AT MANAGING THIS EVER CHANGING LANDSCAPE. BASED ON WHAT WE'RE HEARING FROM FAMILIES ADDRESS WEST HAS THREE SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS FOR HOW THE STATE CAN ADDRESS CHALLENGES PRESENTED BY RE OPENING. SCHOOLS AND HYBRID LEARNING. NUMBER ONE. DIGITAL EQUITY REMAINS A CRITICAL ISSUE. THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DIRECT CD E. TO COLLECT DATA TO DETERMINE REMAINING DEVICE AND CONNECTIVITY NEEDS. AND WORK IN PARTNERSHIP WITH SERVICE PROVIDERS TO MEET THIS NEED. CITY SHOULD PROVIDE CLEAR AND SPECIFIC GUIDANCE ON HOW SCHOOLS AND ELEAZAR SHOULD SUPPORT STUDENTS AND FAMILIES IN MAKING TECHNOLOGY MORE ACCESSIBLE. INCLUDING BY PROVIDING TECHNOLOGY SUPPORT. DISTANCE LEARNING AND HYBRID LEARNING THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD SEPARATE APARTMENTS AROUND THE AMOUNT OF ASYNCHRONOUS AND SYNCHRONOUS INSTRUCTION FOR DISTANCE AND HYBRID LEARNING. AND DEFINED ATTENDANCE AND PARTICIPATION FOR NON PUNITIVE PURPOSES IN SETTING THESE REQUIREMENTS THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSULT PARENTS STUDENTS AND TEACHERS STAKEHOLDERS. AS WELL AS THE MOST RELEVANT RESEARCH ADDITIONALLY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DIRECT THE FEEDING E. TO COLLECT DATA ON INSTRUCTIONAL MODELS THAT SCHOOLS ARE USING. INCLUDING WHICH STUDENTS ARE BEING SERVED BY WHICH MODELS ATTENDANCE AND ENGAGEMENT RATES ALONG WITH OTHER KEY DATA TO HELP GUIDE DECISION MAKING DURING THIS SCHOOL YEAR. THE STATE AND LOCAL DISTRICTS NEED DATA TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS. FINALLY STUDENT AND FAMILY ENGAGEMENT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD DIRECT CD E. AND C. C. E. TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT TO EDUCATORS ON HOW TO BEST ENGAGE FAMILIES AND STUDENTS IN A HYBRID ENVIRONMENT. AS WELL AS HOW TO CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT OF HEALING AND WELLNESS TO SUPPORT SIGNIFICANT STUDENT SOCIAL EMOTIONAL NEEDS AT THIS TIME. IN CLOSING WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO READ THE FINE EDUCATION PRIORITIZE EQUITY AND REBUILD SCHOOLS TO BE PLACES OF HEALING THAT NURTURE STUDENTS SOCIAL EMOTIONAL AND ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT SO THAT ALL STUDENTS CAN THRIVE. ACROSS ALL EFFORTS ONE COMMONSENSE PRINCIPLE MUST APPLY. DIRECT THE MOST RESOURCES TO THE FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES HIT HARDEST. ALL OF THIS WILL REQUIRE FINANCIAL RESOURCES SO WE WILL NEED TO LEVERAGE FEDERAL DOLLARS AND PROTECT STATE EDUCATION FUNDING. THROUGHOUT THE PROCESS ADDRESS WEST IS HERE TO HELP. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU. I WILL NOW GET TO QUESTIONS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS ON THE NEXT AYE PANEL AYE I DO HAVE SOME BUT I'LL START OFF WITH OTHER COMMITTEES MEMBERS FIRST THE FIRST TO HEAR DR ARAMBULA NEXT TO ME WAS TO BEGIN SHARKS ARAMBULA MY FIRST QUESTION IS FOR- BILL SIMMONS. YOU KNOW. BILL UNDERSTAND YOU REPRESENT- TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND WANTED TO SPEAK HYPOTHETICALLY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT'S- ACTUALLY OCCURRING IN MY BACKYARD YOU MIGHT NOT BE AWARE ABOUT IT BUT JUST HOPING YOU CAN SPEAK TO. WHAT YOU WOULD RECOMMEND AS A TEACHER OR SOMEONE WHO'S ON THE FRONT LINES. I HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF REPRESENTING FOURTEEN CITIES WE HAVE THIRTY PLUS DISTRICTS IN FRESNO COUNTY. THE THREE LARGEST ONCE DECIDED NOT TO OPEN BUT SANGER UNIFIED AS OF LAST WEEK DID DECIDE TO OPEN THEIR OWN MENTERI SCHOOL. BUT THEY OPENED WITHOUT CONSULTING THEIR TEACHERS. AND IF YOU LOOK TOWARDS SANGER UNIFIED TEACHERS ASSOCIATION THEY PULLED OVER TWO HUNDRED OF THEIR MEMBERS. OF THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION AND WERE READY TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL. THEY ACTUALLY SAID THEY FELT THAT THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WAS RUSHING. SO MY QUESTION FOR YOU IS WHAT RECOURSE DO TEACHERS HAVE. WHAT OPTIONS DO THOSE WHO ARE ON THE FRONT LINES. HAVE FOR ADVOCATING FOR THEIR STUDENTS AND THEMSELVES IN THE MIDST OF THIS CRISIS. WELL AS YOU KNOW DISTRICTS CAN HAVE THE CHOICE OF REOPENING WE'VE BEEN FORTUNATE IN SAN JUAN BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO- HAVE DISCUSSIONS- WITH THE DISTRICT AND WORK TOGETHER- ON RE OPENING SO THEY HAVE CONSULTED US BUT IF OUR DISTRICT WHERE TO- DECIDE TO RE OPEN IT NEXT WEEK- OUR TEACHERS DON'T HAVE- A LOT OF CHOICE- THEY'RE REQUIRED IT'S PART OF THEIR JOB TO- RETURNED TO WORK. UNFORTUNATELY. THEY DON'T FEEL SAFE- IF THEY DON'T THINK ALL THE SAFETY MEASURES ARE IN PLACE AND- AS WAS MENTIONED EARLIER. THE NEED FOR TESTING SO THAT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND- THAT THEY THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE FEET THAT THEY WOULD FEEL SAFE- IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW I WILL JUST- SAY EARLIER YOU HAD SAID THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE GUIDELINES WITHOUT GETTING INTO THE DETAILS AND- WHILE I AGREE WITH THAT- IN PRINCIPLE AND IN THIS CASE AS WELL. I WOULD BE CONCERNED TOWARDS WHAT TO OUR CHAIRWOMAN OF APPROPRIATIONS DESCRIBED AS A POTENTIAL FOR THE WILD WEST. I THINK YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THOSE WHO ARE IN THE CLASSROOMS I THINK YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE TEACHERS I THINK WE MUST. LISTEN TO THEM FOR US TO DELIVER A GOOD PRODUCT AND SO WHILE I HEAR YOU SAYING THAT TEACHERS DON'T HAVE A DIRECT LINE OF INPUT I THINK THEY SHOULD. AND I THINK WE NEED TO BE INCLUSIVE OF THEIR OPINION IN ALL DECISIONS THAT WE'RE MAKING REGARDING STUDENTS THEY ARE GREAT ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN AND I. STRONGLY BELIEVE WE NEED TO DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE THEIR PARTICIPATION IN THESE DISCUSSIONS THANK YOU MISTER. THANK YOU. A DOLLAR SCANDALOUS. SERVICE GONZALEZ M. VETERANS I GUESS I ASK A NUMBER OF YOU AS WORK WERE IT SEEMS AS FAR LOWER INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR RETURNS IN PERSON- WHAT IF ANYTHING CAN WE DO ABOUT THAT I THINK. I COULD ASK PAUL FROM. THAT COUNTY BOARD I'M SORRY OF MY AS COUNTY SUPER. YES OR AS MISS REPORT FROM AND TRY WELL WHAT WHAT. WHY IS THE REASONING IS THE SCHOOL AREN'T RE OPENING WITH HAVE ENOUGH TO RIO OR IS THERE ARE. A NUMBER OF THESE COMMUNITIES WHO ARE FEELING MORE AND SAFE TO SEND CHILDREN BACK. AND WHAT CAN WE DO TO SUPPORT THEM MORE WE NEED TO. SUPPORT THEM MORE. HELLO THIS IS RACHEL REFLOW- THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I THINK THIS IS WHERE THE LACK OF DATA IS REALLY CHALLENGING BECAUSE IT IS DIFFICULT TO KNOW EXACTLY. WHICH FAMILIES ARE- HAVING WHICH OPTIONS AND MAKING WHICH CHOICES ON A STATEWIDE BASIS WHAT WE DO KNOW FROM OUR POLL IS THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE REPORTING THAT THEY ARE NOT HAVING THE OPTION ON THERE. THE REPORTING THAT THERE OPTION IS AT A MUCH LOWER RATE THAN HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES. AND SO WE CAN PROBABLY DRIVE FROM THAT THAT- COMMUNITIES THAT SERVE- SCHOOLS THAT SERVE LOW INCOME FAMILIES ARE PERHAPS NOT OPENING UP AT THE SAME RATE AS MORE A- MORE RESOURCE COMMUNITIES I THINK IT WOULD ALSO BE IMPORTANT TO COLLECT DATA ON. WHEN SCHOOLS ARE PROVIDING PARENTS WITH AN OPTION TO RETURN TO A HYBRID OR IN PERSON AND FAMILIES ARE CHOOSING TO STAY IN EXTENDED DISTANCE LEARNING WHAT THE REASONS ARE FOR THAT DECISION. IS IT AN ISSUE OF TRANSPORTATION IS THAT AN ISSUE OF CHILD CARE BASED ON THE HYBRID SCHEDULE IS IT AN ISSUE OF CONCERN- FOR HEALTH AND SAFETY OF EITHER THE CHILD OR FAMILY MEMBERS- THE STATE WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT TO THEN BE ABLE TO ANSWER. THE QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT- AND SO WITHOUT THAT DATA IT'S CHALLENGING BUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WE DO RECOMMEND THAT- DISTRICTS COLLECT THIS DATA SO THAT THEY CAN MAKE THE APPROPRIATE. ACCOMMODATIONS TO SUPPORT ALL FAMILIES TO HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO HYBRID OR IN PERSON LEARNING- AND AT THE STATE LEVEL RECOMMENDED THAT THERE BE SPECIFIC GUIDANCE THAT IS REQUIRING LOCALS A LOCAL DISTRICTS TO COLLECT. THIS DATA. THANK YOU. THANK I WANT TO GO BACK TO THE TO OUR REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE SANTA TEACHER ASSOC MISTER SIMMONS. HI BILL YES SIR BILL SUFFERS WAS TO NOTE THAT- UP MY COLOR OVER HERE ASKED WHERE IS SAN JUAN TO SAN JUAN IS ABOUT FIVE MILES TO THE EAST OF HERE.

DOCTOR RAMBLE UP ON AND YOU KNOW THAT THEIR NEEDS AND THE REQUESTED AND FRANKLY REASONABLE REQUESTS AND COMMONSENSE REQUEST FROM. OUR TEACHERS AND FRANKLY OUR COMMUNITY AS AS FAR AS THE RE OPENING AND TESTING AND CONTACT TRACING AND SO FORTH. SO AND I AM A LITTLE BIT CONFUSED BECAUSE A FEW WEEKS AGO I SAW THERE THERE READ THE- SUGGESTION BITER STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION AND I KNOW WE HAVE MULTIPLE CHAPTERS AND- AS FAR AS THE ASK THAT HAVING A VACCINE IN PLACE BEFORE. RE OPENING I DIDN'T HEAR YOU SAY THAT TODAY AND SO I JUST WANT YOU CAN CAN YOU CAN CLARIFY FOR THE RECORD AS FAR AS- WHAT IS FROM OUR CLASSROOM TEACHERS AROUND THE STATE. WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THE REQUEST FROM CALIFORNIA AS FAR AS HAVING A VACCINE IN PLACE AND REQUIREMENTS FOR ITS UTILIZATION FOR OUR SCHOOLS BEFORE WE HAVE RE OPENING. WELL I ONLY REPRESENT TWENTY THREE HUNDRED TEACHERS AND I CAN'T REPRESENT ALL TEACHERS BECAUSE- THERE ARE TEACHERS THAT WOULD COME BACK- TODAY IF PROPER SAFETY MEASURES WERE IN PLACE- BUT THERE ARE MANY TEACHERS THAT ARE FEARFUL AND WOULD WANT- HAVE A VACCINE IN PLACE- IT'S VERY DIFFICULT TO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT COMING BACK IN A HYBRID MODEL WHEN WE LOOK AT THE FACT THAT STUDENTS- I'VE GONE AND LOOKED AT OTHER HYBID MODELS AND THOSE STUDENTS IN OTHER DISTRICTS ARE ACTUALLY. SEEING THEIR TEACHER LAST. HI THEN ARE TEACHERS CURRENT. ARE SOME IN THE DEATH ONE MODEL YOU THOUGH IT'S OVER THERE. AT AND IT'S A LITTLE I. FOR ME TO BE SITTING HERE IN A ROOM- AT THE BOTTOM OF THE STATE CAPITOL- BY MYSELF. WITH WITH A SECURITY GUARD HERE AND- EVERYONE ELSE- DOING THIS VIRTUALLY WITH MARATHON YET WE EXPECT OUR SCHOOLS TO OPEN UP AND- HAVE OUR STUDENTS IN PLACE. AND IT IT JUST IS A LITTLE IRONIC THAT THAT IS THE CASE I MEAN IF YOU CAN'T HAVE ME IN THE SAME ROOM WITH THIS WITH YOUR COMMITTEE I N. OF FIVE PEOPLE. WHAT HOW WHY WOULD IT WHY WOULD YOU THINK THAT- YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BRING STUDENTS BACK INTO A CLASSROOM SO- HAVING THE GUIDELINES- THAT ARE CLEAR AND NOT CONSTANTLY CHANGING. WOULD BE HELPFUL AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS PANDEMIC IS CHANGING RAPIDLY BUT IT'S MAKES IT VERY DIFFICULT TO MAKE PLANS UNDER THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES HAVING TESTING AVAILABLE SO PEOPLE FEEL CONFIDENT. THAT PEOPLE ARE COMING INTO THE SCHOOLS AND THEY'RE SAFE- WOULD BE HELPFUL. ANDPROVIDING ALL OF THE- FUNDING SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT THE SCHOOLS ARE ALL. CLEAN AND WE HAVE ALL THE PROPER PP THAT'S WHAT WOULD BE HELPFUL. OKAY THANK YOU SO YOU ARE OF COURSE A DISTRICT OF FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE IN THERE ARE SIX MILLION FORTY THOUSAND STUDENTS THERE ARE SIX MILLION KIDS IN CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS AND SO THAT THE SNAPSHOT OF A LARGER LARGER SNAPSHOT. SO YOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT- RECENTLY VOTED TO RE OPEN ON THE FIFTH OF JUNE OF JANUARY AND THE I GUESS THE BOARD VOTED ON AND I ASSUME THAT THE TEACHERS ASSOCIATION WAS PART OF THAT EQUATION SO WHAT ARE YOU DOING A YEAR DISTRICT AS FAR AS A TESTING AND IS THAT MEET. YOUR YOUR- HAD A COMFORT LEVEL FOR YOUR TEACHERS IN YOUR DISTRICT. WELL ACTUALLY HAVE NOT- BEEN ABLE TO UNDERGO. WITH THE DESK TESTING PER. RIGHT NOW THE GUIDELINES ARE THAT EVERY- EVERY STAFF MEMBER BE TESTED EVERY WEEK. WHICH WOULD MEAN ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY PEOPLE A WEEK WOULD BE TESTED. I DON'T BELIEVE RIGHT NOW THE DISTRICT HAS SIX HUNDRED FIFTY TESTS AVAILABLE- AND THEY'RE TALKING TO US ABOUT- HAVING. OUR MEMBERS GO TO COUNTY TESTING SITE THERE'S NOT ONE TESTING SITE THAT'S WITHIN OUR DISTRICT NEAR MANY OF OUR SCHOOLS RIGHT NOW IN THE COUNTY. AND SO- THAT PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE- STAFF PERSON SO WE ACTUALLY HAVE A NEGOTIATED THAT YET BECAUSE TESTING STILL SEEMS TO BE THE% BIGGEST CHALLENGE BECAUSE THE AVAILABILITY OF TEST R. R. M. DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE. SELL IT TO WRAP THAT UP FOR YOU FIRSTHAND WHY AND YOU'RE STILL WELL THERE HAVE A REOPEN DATE YOU'RE STILL NEGOTIATING WITH THE WITH YOUR DISTRICT ON SATISFACTORY PROTOCOLS FOR TESTING AND I WOULD ASSUME THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING FOR TEACHERS ACROSS THE STATE. ALL RIGHT I WOULD ASSUME THAT ALSO AND- WE ARE. WEARE ON. RE OPENING WE HAVE FACED THEN ARE RE OPENING SO WE WELL- WE HAVE ALREADY STARTED WITH- ONE ON ONE ASSESSMENT AT SCHOOL SITE AND AS I MENTIONED NEXT WEEK WE ARE RE OPENING FOR SMALL COHORTS OF SPECIAL EDUCATION STUDENTS AND WE ARE WORKING- TO- HOPEFULLY REOPEN SMALL COHORTS OF YALE STUDENTS PRIOR TO JANUARY- BUT- THE LOGISTICS OF RE OPENING A SCHOOL DISTRICT WITH SIXTY FOUR SITE. IN. FORTY THOUSAND IS FAIRLY MONUMENTAL YEAH AND WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO THAT YOU KNOW THE PARENTS IN THE DISTRICT WHO SAY WE'RE STILL WORKING ON IT BUT WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR EIGHT MONTHS AND YOU KNOW KIDS AS DR ARAMBULA NOTED IN DISTANCE LEARNING ARE HAVING A TOUGH TIME I KNOW MY OWN KIDS IN A LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE AS WELL AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE TRYING WE DON'T LET THE PERFECT BE THE ENEMY IN THE GOOD. OF THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD AND YOU KNOW WE'RE STILL OF COURSE MONITORING WHAT LEVEL WERE AT AND RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN THE RED WHICH ALLOWS IT I KNOW ONE DISTRICT IS HOPING TO GET THE ORANGE BEFORE THEY CAN BUT THE RED THEY CAN OPEN OUR STANDING AND SO WHAT DO WE SAY TO THE FAMILIES WHO ARE LIKE HEY PEOPLE ADULTS WE'VE HAD. SIX SURPLUS MONTHS TO GET TO GET IT RIGHT AND TO SAY WE'RE STILL TRYING TO FIGURE IT OUT IS UNACCEPTABLE I AYE AYE WHICH. THE GUEST THAT YOU HAVE HEALTH OFFICIALS THAT CAN ANSWER QUESTION. AS AND YOU HAVE. OFFICIALS STATE. THAT HAVE CHANGED GUIDELINES ON US. SOMETIMES THREE TIMES IN A WEEK AND YOU'RE ASKING THE LOCAL DISTRICT AND LOCAL TEACHERS ABOUT WHY WE'RE NOT OPEN. THIS IS A PANDEMIC. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED A HUNDRED OVER A HUNDRED YEARS. SO WE WANT TO BE WITH OUR STUDENTS THAT'S OUR PREFERENCE. OUR TEACHERS ARE DOING EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO DISTANCE LEARNING TO INTERACT WITH THE STUDENTS IN A POSITIVE WAY. BUT THE CHALLENGES THAT THIS IS A PANDEMIC AND PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND. THAT EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE SAFE. WE HAVE SCHOOLS IN OTHER STATE OF ARIZONA HAD A- MIDDLE SCHOOL THAT THEY HAD TO CLOSE DOWN JUST YESTERDAY OR THE DAY BEFORE. BECAUSE THEY HAD SEVERAL CASES THERE SO EVERY TIME OUR TEACHERS. AND OUR FAMILIES HERE ABOUT THIS THAT'S WHY WE HAVE MORE STUDENTS MOVING TO HOME SCHOOL. BECAUSE PEOPLE ARE STILL NOT FEELING SO. IN THIS FANDOM. OKAY THANK YOU FURTHER QUESTIONS YES MR DAHLE I JUST A COMMENT I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING THE TEACHERS AS A TEACHER- I APPRECIATE YOUR VOICE IN THIS CONVERSATION AND YOU YOUR POINT THAT SHE WERE EXPECTING STUDENTS TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL YET WE WON'T EVEN LET PEOPLE WALK INTO THIS ROOM AND SPEAK TO US FROM FIFTEEN FEET AWAY AS A VERY VALID POINT IT IS A VERY VERY VALID POINT SO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT. AND I JUST SPEAK FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE I USUALLY STOP IN THE FALL OF ONE HAVE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME I CAN'T ACT I'M NOT DOING IT NOW BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO GET ON THE SOON THING I DON'T KNOW WELL ENOUGH. SO I'M NOT DOING THAT NOW BUT I DID HAVE A CHANCE TO THAT IT IS SPEAK MY DAUGHTER'S GOVERNMENT CLASS- HER HIGH SCHOOL GOVERNMENT CLASS AND I TAKE A FROM A TEACHER'S PERSPECTIVE IT WILL FIVE TO NO I WAS LOOKING AT THE KIDS THEY WERE TALKING TO ME AND ASKING ME SOME QUESTIONS IT IS INTERESTING WHEN YOU'RE BEHIND THAT. SCREEN YOU'RE LOOKING INTO STUDENTS HOMES. WHICH YOU NEED TO REALIZE THERE'S JUST. I GUESS BUT ALSO THAT THEY ARE. AND THEY'RE HOME. AND STUDENTS DIFFERING LIVING SITUATIONS I SAW THAT. I BLATANTLY THERE SENT AND BACKGROUND ETCETERA TO MATCH WHEN YOU. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE OTHER OTHER BROTHERS AND SISTERS AT HOME OR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS ETCETERA. SO THIS IS JUST A VERY VERY DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENT. AND I HAVE A LOT OF TEACHER FRIENDS WHO- THE WORKING VERY HARD JUST TO LEARN THE TECHNOLOGY. AND ONE THING% WE HAVEN'T DONE ONE ON CALIFORNIA'S PREPARING FOR ONLINE LEARNING GOING FORWARD I THINK IT'LL BE SOME COMPONENT OF IT GOING FORWARD. BUT MINUTES DURING THE SCHOOL DAY COULD BE AFTER THE SCHOOL THEIR CENTER. BUT WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT THE PLATFORM'S TEACHERS AGO BEGAN TO REALIZE TEACHER OPEN AN EMAIL. OKAY THEN OPEN HILL FROM THE SA HIM HIT IT IN A WORD DOC. AND THEN HAVE TO GRADE IT GOING TO ANOTHER DOCUMENT THEN PUT IT INTO ANOTHER YOU KNOW PUT IT IN A GREAT BOOK. AND MAYBE MAKE SOME OTHER COMMENTS ON THIS THEY CAN BE OPERATING WITHIN THREE FOUR FIVE PLATFORMS. YOU KNOW OVER ONE ESSAY I THINK OF THE TIME ASSOCIATED. IF YOU'VE GOT THIRTY FIVE STUDENTS YOU GOT THIRTY FIVE EIGHTH GRADE ESSAYS THAT HAVE TO BE GRADED. THINK OF THE TIME ASSOCIATED. JUST NOT EVEN IT NOT NOT EVEN YOU KNOW. JUST GRADING THE S. BUT JUST LOGISTICS. WITH GRAY IT. GETTING THROUGH ALL PLOT SO IT IS HURRICANE. SO I JUST WANT THANK YOU AND THANK YOU. REALLY TO THE TEACHERS A CALIFORNIA THANK YOU.

I'M WILL PERISH FOUNDER OF TEN STRANDS AN EDUCATIONAL NONPROFIT THAT IS ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL LITERACY. IN CALIFORNIA'S K. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS. I'M HERE TODAY TO REQUEST THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT SCHOOLS AND UTILIZING THE OUTDOORS SO MORE STUDENTS CAN SAFELY RETURN TO SCHOOL. WE KNOW THE PANDEMIC IS CAUSING STRESS TRAUMA AND SOCIAL ISOLATION. IT'S ALSO CREATING DEVASTATING LEARNING LOSS THAT EXPANDS THE DIGITAL DIVIDE. ONE POINT EIGHT MILLION CALIFORNIA STUDENTS STILL DON'T HAVE ACCESS TO HIGH SPEED INTERNET. SIX HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND STILL DON'T HAVE A COMPUTER OR OTHER DEVICE. THE MAJORITY OUR STUDENTS OF COLOR AND THOSE FROM LOW INCOME FAMILIES. CLOSURES EXACERBATE INEQUALITIES VULNERABLE STUDENTS FACE EVERY SINGLE DAY. THE USE OF OUTDOOR SPACES IS AN EQUITABLE COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGY TO MAXIMIZE THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO CAN SAFELY RETURN TO CAMPUS WHILE FOLLOWING PHYSICAL DISTANCING MEASURES. THAT'S WHY TEN STRANDS AND OUR PARTNERS GREEN SCHOOLYARDS AMERICA SAN MATTEO COE AND UC BERKELEY'S LAWRENCE HALL OF SCIENCE FOUNDED THE NATIONAL COVE ED NINETEEN OUTDOOR LEARNING INITIATIVE. SINCE MAY MORE THAN A HUNDRED PARTNER ORGANIZATIONS AND VOLUNTEERS HAVE JOINED AND ARE HELPING SCHOOLS REOPEN SAFELY AND EQUITABLY USING OUTDOOR SPACES. AB THREE BENEFITS ABOUT OUR LEARNING OUR WELL BEING OUTDOORS GREATLY REDUCES THE RISK OF VIRUS TRANSMISSION. EXPOSURE TO NATURE IMPROVES MENTAL HEALTH BY REDUCING STRESS AND RESTORING THE ABILITY TO PAY ATTENTION. STUDENTS CONNECT WITH THEIR ENVIRONMENT AND WANT TO BECOME STEWARDS. OUTDOOR LEARNING WORKS IN MANY SCHOOL PROGRAMS CORE CURRICULUM LIKE SCIENCE AND HISTORY LIBRARY ART MUSIC GARDEN AND OF COURSE ENVIRONMENTAL EDUCATION. P. AND RECESS LUNCH AND OTHER MEALS BEFORE AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS. OUTDOOR LEARNING IS A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY TO RE OPEN SCHOOLS SAFELY AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ADEQUATE FUNDING FOR IMPLEMENTATION. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU. OKAY OUR FINAL SPEAKER FORTY TWO TO PLEASE BE IN. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE I CAN BE HEARD AND I WOULD JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK THAT YOU DON'T PAY ATTENTION TO YOUR DEVICES THE WAY YOU ARE PAYING ATTENTION TO YOUR DEVICES WITH THE LAST TWO SPEAKERS GOOD I HAVE EYE CONTACT. MY NAME IS SANDRA HAD STRUM. AND I'M MARRIED TO A SAN JUAN PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHER HE WAS IN THE SENATE YESTERDAY WITH ME IN A SIMILAR HEARING AND HE WASN'T ABLE TO GIVE HIS PUBLIC COMMENTS. BECAUSE HE HAD TO LEAVE AFTER WAITING FOR THREE HOURS I'M BACK TODAY WITH THE SAME COMMENT THAT HE HAD WRITTEN THAT I WASN'T ALLOWED TO READ ON HIS BEHALF KEVIN MCCARTY I'M GLAD THAT SCREEN IS SO INTERESTING TO YOU FAR MORE INTERESTING THAN THE PERSON STANDING BEFORE YOU. AND THIS PROVES MY POINT THE SCREENS AREN'T WORKING. THEY'RE HURTING THE CHILDREN. MY HUSBAND IS NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH BILL SIMMONS BILL SIMMONS MAY THINK HE REPRESENTS ALL SAN JUAN TEACHERS BUT HE DOES NOT. MY HUSBAND TEACHES KINDERGARTEN IN THE SAN JUAN SCHOOL DISTRICT AND HE IS NOT IN SUPPORT OF THESE LOCKDOWNS HE NEVER HAS BEEN IN SUPPORT OF THESE LOCKDOWNS HE IS NOT IN SUPPORT OF MASKING CHILDREN. AND WE ARE ALSO THE PARENTS OF FOUR CHILDREN THREE OF WHOM ARE BEING ZOOM SCHOOLED CURRENTLY IN THE SAN JUAN SCHOOL DISTRICT AND DESPITE WHAT YOUR EXPERTS AS THEY WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO A MASKED ENVIRONMENT NOT BECAUSE WE'RE FEARFUL OF THE COATED. THE COVE AND THAT HAS A IS NO LONGER CALLING A PANDEMIC BUT BECAUSE WE KNOW WHAT YOU LEGISLATORS ARE UP TO AND YOUR LITTLE GAME. FROM SELLING OUR CHILDREN TO PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES LOADING THEM UP WITH VACCINES THAT PARENTS DON'T WANT TO SELLING THEM TO TACK MAKING MONEY AT THEIR EXPENSE YEAH FIFTY YOU SHOULD ALL BE ASHAMED OF YOURSELVES. YOUR LITTLE GAME IS OVER THE PARENTS ARE DONE AND YOUR GOING TO NEED TO FIND OTHER WAYS TO FUND YOUR CRIMES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. OKAY WITH THAT NO MORE PUBLIC TESTIMONY AND WE WILL ADJOURN TODAY'S HEARING THANK YOU.
