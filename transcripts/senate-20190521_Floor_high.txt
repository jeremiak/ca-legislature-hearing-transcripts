MISTER MISTER MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FORTY SEVEN BY SENATOR ALLEN AN ACT RELATING TO ELECTIONS. SENATOR ALLEN THE FLOOR IS YOURS MEMBERS THANKS SO MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT -- THIS BILL REQUIRES SIGNATURE GATHERS TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIA VOTERS. WITH THE NAMES OF THE TOP THREE FUNDERS OF AN INITIATIVE CAMPAIGN AT A MOMENT WHEN THAT DISCLOSURE IS CRUCIAL. WHEN PHYSICAL PETITION IS PLACE BEFORE VOTERS AND THEY'RE DECIDING WHETHER TO SIGN IT? TO GIVE YOU A CONTEXT -- IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE HAD THIRTY SEVEN THIS IF THE QUALIFIED FOR CIRCULATION THE PUBLIC TWELVE QUALIFY FOR THE BALLOT. IN TWENTY SIXTEEN A NEAR RECORD SEVENTEEN EMISSIONS APPEAR IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT. EVERY ONE OF THESE TWENTY NINE PROPOSITIONS A QUALIFIED BY SIGNATURE GATHERING DID SO I I ONLY AFTER A MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE WAS SPENT ON PAID SIGNATURE GATHERING WITH VOTERS. REALLY KNOWING WHO THOSE MINERS WORK -- MEMBER TO MEMBER THAT WE PASS TO DISCLOSE ACT WHICH PROVIDE DISCLOSURE NOW FOR A TELEVISION ADS. WE NOW HAVE ALSO PROVED BUT PASSED THE SOCIAL MEDIA DISCLOSE ACT WHICH MAKES IT SO THAT ADDS THAT ARE ONLINE -- THEY REALLY TO POLITICAL MESSAGING IN CAMPAIGNS THE THE TOP DONORS HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED THEIR THIS IS THE SAME THING HERE -- YOU KNOW WHEN YOU GO TO THE MARKET YOU'RE JUST TRYING TO GET SOME LETTUCE IS THE MILKER NOT FROM SANTA MONICA SO WE LIKE TO BUY. HE WON FERRO AND AND FETA CHEESE. ARE THE THREE FOOD GROUPS -- YOU KNOW SOMEONE THRUST INTO YOUR HANDS A A BALLOT YOU KNOW THE PETITION DRIVE IN SAYS THIS IS GONNA SAY WESTERN CIVILIZATION AS WE KNOW IT. HALF THE TIME THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW WHO'S PAYING FOR THE SIGNATURE COLLECTION THEY JUST KNOW THEY'RE GETTING PAID FIVE OR SIX BUCKS. A SIGNATURE AND AND SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS MAKE SURE THAT THE VOTER HAS ACCESS THE BASIC INFORMATION WHO'S PAYING FOR IT COULD BE A UNION COULD BE A COMPANY COULD BE A TRADE ORGANIZATION I DON'T KNOW WHAT -- BUT THE VOTER DOES DESERVE TO HAVE THAT ACCESS SOME INFORMATION THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER ALLEN DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SINGING HEARING NONE MADAM SECRETARY I'M SORRY SENATOR BORCHERS FORGIVE ME THEN SEE THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT JUST FOR CLARIFICATION ON A MAP POSE A QUESTION -- TO AUTHOR YOU HAVE ANY OBJECTION ACCEPTING QUESTION OBJECTION OR BOARD JUST GO FORWARD THANK YOU -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS AS YOU MENTIONED EARLIER WOULD APPLY TO ANY TOP DONOR WHETHER IT'S AN INDIVIDUAL OR AN ENTITY. IS THAT CORRECT. THAT IS CORRECT SUBJECT TO THE YEAR MARKING RULES THAT WE HAD BUILT INTO THE DISCLOSE ACT. YES CAN YOU JUST. IN A PREVIOUS -- ASH AND TELL ME THAT EFFECTIVELY ON WHAT WE DON'T WANT TO ALLOW FOR IS FOR THERE TO BE LIKE SHELL ORGANIZATIONS THAT ARE CREATED SO THAT IF AN INDIVIDUAL OR ENTITY. THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S THE WHOLE LEAF FUNDING AND AN ENTITY. IF YOU DON'T WANT TO HAVE -- YOU KNOW ACME CORPORATION CREATE AN ALLIANCE FOR JOBS PAY FOR IT ENTIRELY AND SOMEHOW BE ABLE TO SEE ALLIANCE FOR JOBS INSTEAD OF ACME CORPORATION OR WERE YOU ACTUALLY UNION TO DO THE SAME. OUT WAS SIMILAR WITH IT WITH IT WITH AN INDIVIDUAL SO -- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE ACTUALLY GETTING WHO'S PAYING FOR IT WHETHER IT'S AN ORGANIZATION A COMPANY A UNION OR AN INDIVIDUAL -- BUT BUT YES IT WOULD APPLY TO ANY ANY OF THOSE -- ENTITIES WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THERE'S NOT. GAMES BEING PLAYED. A SHELL ORGANIZATION BEING CREATED TO HIDE THE IDENTITY OF THAT UNION OR ORGANIZATION OR COMPANY OR INDIVIDUAL SO HYPOTHETICALLY IF THERE WERE THREE TRADE ASSOCIATIONS THAT COMBINED THEIR RESOURCES TO CREATE CALIFORNIA FOR JOBS. WITH THAT DISCLOSE CALIFORNIA FOR JOBS OR WHAT IT RIVER REQUIRE THE THE CONTRIBUTING ENTITIES INTO CALIFORNIA FOR JOBS IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND I CAN GET YOU SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE WAY THE RULES WORK BUT I BUT I BUT BUT ESSENTIALLY. IT HAS TO DO THERE'S A COUPLE FACTORS ONE HAS TO DO WITH YOUR MARKETING. SO -- LET'S SAY THOSE IF THOSE COMPANIES ARE GIVING THAT MONEY TO JOBS PACK FOR EXAMPLE THE CHAMBERS -- PACKED FOR GENERAL USE PURPOSES DURING THE ELECTION. THEN IT WOULD BE JOBS PACKED THAT WOULD BE THE NAME THAT'S ON THERE BUT IF THIS IS BEING DONE SPECIFICALLY FOR THIS PARTICULAR RACE. AND THE MONEY BEING YOUR MORE FOR THAT RACE AND THIS ORGANIZATION IS BEING CREATED JUST TO MESSAGE FOR THAT RACE THEN THOSE INDIVIDUAL OUR COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO BE DISCLOSED. OKAY THERE'S A THIRTY DAY GRACE PERIOD -- FOR UPDATING THE MATERIAL -- OF THE TOP. THREE RIGHT SO THE IDEA IS THAT WE WANTED TO MAKE IT SO THAT IT WASN'T TOO OWNERS FOR THE SIGNATURE GATHERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE WAS. A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF UPDATE BEING MADE IN CASE THERE WERE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE BIG DONORS TO A PARTICULAR CAMPAIGN. BUT WE WANTED TO GIVE THE SIGNATURE GATHERS THE TIME IN THE CONVENIENCE TO BE ABLE TO JUST GO ONLINE PRINT UP -- THE A MONTHLY SHE THAT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO DISCLOSE -- WHO THE DONORS ARE BUT DO SO IN A WAY THAT PROVIDE THEM WITH A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY THANK YOU? THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR ALLEN YOU MAY CLOSE REALLY APPRECIATE THE QUESTIONS I I THINK THAT THE QUESTIONS TO GET WHICH TRANSPARENCY IN JUST MAKING IT SO THAT. PEOPLE WILL KNOW -- WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THEY'RE GIVEN THAT SIGNATURE PETITION OUT AT THE STORE -- WHO'S WHO'S WHO'S PAYING FOR IT. ARE BY THE WAY ALSO PROVIDES FOR ENDORSEMENT SO THAT IF LEGAL WOMEN VOTERS OR ANOTHER ORGANIZATION IS ENDORSED THE MEASURE THEY CAN PUT THAT INFORMATION ON THERE AS WELL. VOTERS NEED TO KNOW WE WE OFTENTIMES YOU NO HAN ON OUR ANALYSES WE GET TO SEE WHO COMES OUT SUPPORTER IN OPPOSITION TO THE THINGS THAT WE VOTE FOR THE VOTERS DESERVE THAT CHANCE TO WE'VE HARD SO MANY STORIES OF PEOPLE BEING. BEING DISSUADED OR BAMBOOZLED OR OR OR OR YOU KNOW MANIPULATED TO SIGN SOMETHING THAT -- THAT THEY MAY BE AGAINST THE VALUES THAT THEY HOLD DEAR THIS IS ABOUT DISCLOSURES ABOUT TRANSPARENCY AND I I I RESPECTFULLY ASK MY VOTE.

SENATE BILL TWO ZERO TWO BY SENATOR WELK AN AXE ROOM LEADING TO ANIMALS SENATOR WILL THE FLOOR IS YOURS SHAKY MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS A RISE 2% SB. TWO OH TWO THE BILL THAT WILL HELP SAVE THE LIVES OF OUR BELOVED ANIMALS. CALIFORNIA'S FACING A SHORTAGE OF ANIMAL BLOOD A RESOURCE THAT IS CRITICAL TO PERFORM LIFESAVING OPERATIONS WHEN ANIMALS ARE SICK OR SEVERELY INJURED. WE ONLY HAVE TWO COMMERCIAL ANIMAL BLOOD BANKS OPERATING IN THE STATE AND THEY ARE RUNNING OUT OF DONORS. THE PROBLEM IS THAT OUR CURRENT. REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ONLY ALLOWS THE PRODUCTION SO BLOOD FROM THESE CLOSED COLONY BANKS. THESE ARE FACILITIES TO KEEP ANIMALS ON THEIR PROPERTY FOR YEARS JUST TO PROVIDE BLOOD. SB TWO OH TWO WILL MAKE AN ALLOWANCE FOR COMMUNITY BASED OWNERS MEANING PRIVATE PET OWNERS WOULD BE ALLOWED TO VOLUNTEER THEIR ANIMALS TO DONATE BLOOD UNDER THE OVERSIGHT OF THE VETERINARIAN. EVERY OTHER STATE IN THE UNION ALREADY ALLOWS FOR COMMUNITY BASED MODEL WHICH HAS PROVEN TO BE SAFE AND EFFECTIVE. BECAUSE CALIFORNIA DOES NOT CURRENTLY ALLOW FOR THIS OUR BLOOD SUPPLY SPACES SERIES DEFICIT THIS BILL WOULD CHANGE THAT AND GUARANTEE THE HEALTH OF THE ANIMALS EVERYWHERE THIS MEASURES NECESSARY TO ENSURE A HEALTHY A BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY BLOOD. FOR OUR CATS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WILL CONSIDER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING NONE IS THERE ANY OBJECTION DOES. I'M SORRY SENATOR STONE YOU WISH TO SPEAK. YEAH JUST A QUICK COMMENT I'M GONNA RECOMMEND MY MY COLLEAGUE FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THAT -- I'M BRINGING AFFORD BECAUSE OF A PERSONAL SITUATION JUST RECENTLY HAPPENED AS YOU DON'T. MANY TIMES WE WE OFTEN VALUE YOUR PETS SOMETIMES MORE THAN SOME OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS THEIR MEMBER OF OUR FAMILY WE LOVE THEM UNCONDITIONALLY AND THEY LOVE US UNCONDITIONALLY. AND JUST A A QUICK STORY -- MY WIFE AND I WE OFTEN GO TO AUCTIONS AND WE OFTEN -- WILL BID ON RESCUE DOGS AND WE WE HAVE THIS BEAUTIFUL -- BEAUTIFUL CANINE THAT WE WE BET ON AND WE HAVE A VACATION PLANNED. AND WE WENT AWAY AND I ASKED MY DAUGHTER IF SHE WOULD TAKE CARE OF THIS. VERY CUTE LITTLE COPIC PUPPY SO AFTER WE GOT BACK -- COUPLE WEEKS LATER I MY WIFE ALSO TALK ABOUT THE WHOLE TRIP WAS. I MISSING THIS PET I WANT TO GET GET THIS DOG BACK. IN A MINUTE I GOT BACK WE CALLED MY DAUGHTER TO PICK UP THE PAT AND SHE SAID THE YOU DON'T HAVE A PET THAT'S MY PET NOW. YOU KNOW SOME MY MY DAUGHTER -- TOOK. OUR CHILD IF YOU WILL ARE BECAUSE I CHILD OUR DOG WHICH CREATED SOME TENSION BETWEEN MY WIFE MYSELF MY I MENTION THIS BECAUSE THIS DOG WAS REALLY A BEAUTIFUL DOG AND OF COURSE WE EMBRACE OUR DAUGHTER KEEPING AT BUT RECENTLY -- TWELVE YEARS OLD TEN YEARS OLD -- HER NAME IS LILY. AND SHE GOT ALL KINDS OF BOXES ALL OVER HER HER ABDOMEN. AND THEY WENT INTO THE VAT AND FOUND OUT THAT SHE HAD -- A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM THAT REQUIRED BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS AND WE TAKE IT FOR GRANTED THAT THE BLOOD IS AVAILABLE FOR HUMAN BEINGS IF YOU NEED IT AND IT'S NOT ALWAYS AVAILABLE FOR CANINES. AND SO LILY I ENDED UP GETTING TRANSFUSIONS -- THE PROLONG HER LIFE UNTIL WE UNDERSTOOD THAT IT WAS REALLY A A FATAL DISEASE BUT I CAN'T STRESS HOW IMPORTANT AT THIS BLOOD SUPPLY IS MADE AVAILABLE TO TO VETERINARIANS TO OFFER TO THEIR THEIR CLIENTS IN THE BEST INTEREST OF PRESERVING THE LIVES OF THEIR LOVE. PETS AND FOR THOSE REASONS -- IN HONOR OF LILY -- MY DAUGHTER'S VERY SPECIAL -- BUT BE IN OUR BELOVED PUPPY -- I STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT SB. TWO ZERO TWO THANK YOU SENATOR STONE. SIR WILK IN HONOR OF LILY OR ANY OTHER. CREATURE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE YES -- YES BETTER PRESENT. I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE -- FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY FOR SHARING I'M GOING TO REFRAIN FROM TELLING MY MY HEY HEY MY DOG STORIES BUT I WILL SHARE ONE I THINK MANY PEOPLE IN OUR CAPITAL COMMUNITY KNOW ROBIN BLACK. AND KNOW WHAT AN ANIMAL LOVER SHE IS SHE HAD A SITUATION ABOUT EIGHTEEN MONTHS AGO WHERE HER BELOVED DOG WAS ILL. WAS HERE IN A PLACE IN SACRAMENTO NEEDED A BLOOD TRANSFUSION -- WAS NOT AVAILABLE SHE HAD TO DRIVE TO DAVIS AND ON THE WAY FROM SACRAMENTO TO DAVIS -- THE DOG PASSED SO THIS IS JUST ANOTHER WAY TO INCREASE THE SUPPLY. OF BLOOD AND DO IT IN A MORE YOU MAIN WAY WHEN WILL WE GIVE BLOOD WE LEAVE OUR HOMES WE GO WE GIVE BLOOD WE COME BACK WE SHOULD ALLOW THIS THE SAME OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR FOUR LEGGED FRIENDS AGAIN RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER WILL CAN ANYONE ELSE HAVE A DOG STORY. NOT TODAY. VERY GOOD ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED IS THERE ANY OBJECTION THE SUBSTITUTING A UNANIMOUS ROLL CALL. SEEING NO CAT LOVERS HERE ICE THIRTY SEVEN NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES. MOVING ON FILE ITEM SIXTY ONE SENATOR HERTZBERG MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL FIFTY ONE BY SENATOR HERTZBERG AN ACT RELATING TO FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND DECLARING THE URGENCY THERE OF TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT BY -- VOTED IN ALL CORNERS A CALIFORNIA THE PEOPLE PASSED THE ADULT USE OF MARIJUANA ACT OF TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN THAT. LET ME BE EXTENDED THE RECREATIONAL USE TO ALL I MEAN THE THE MEDICAL USE TO RECREATIONAL USE PERIOD. THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BILL AND SEE EXACTLY THE SAME BILL WE HAD LAST YEAR. THAT WAS HELD IN COMMITTEE IN THE ASSEMBLY. IS TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING BANKING ISSUE YOU'RE LITERALLY ACCORDING TO SOME MEMBERS OF THIS HOUSE WHO ARE SERVE THOSE AREAS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS BURIED IN BARRELS. THERE ARE STORY AFTER STORY WITH THIS PUBLIC SAFETY RISK WHERE PEOPLE ARE GETTING HELD UP AT GUNPOINT OR SHOT TO TRY TO GRAB CASH THERE'S SO MUCH CASH IN THE SYSTEM. BECAUSE UNDER THE FEDERAL LAW WE HAVE SCARED THESE ARE MARIJUANA IS DEEMED TO BE A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG WHERE THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA SAY IT'S LEGAL AND SO THEY WON'T BANK IT. SO WHAT WE'VE TRIED TO DO HERE WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN BOTH HOUSES. IS TO COME UP WITH IN THE INTERIM. A PROCESS WHERE WE COME UP WITH A LIMITED CHARTER BANK THAT HAS LIMITED PURPOSES THERE ARE CURRENTLY NINE HUNDRED AND TWENTY EMPTY BRANCHES IN CALIFORNIA THAT COULD EASILY BE RENTED FROM FRESNO LOS ANGELES. OXNARD VENTURA RIVERSIDE SANTA CRUZ SAN FRANCISCO YOU CASA EUREKA AND BEYOND THE COULD EASILY BE RENTED SO THE IDEA IS TO CREATE A LIMITED CHARTER BANK THE JEWS FOR PURPOSES. ONE TO ALLOW VENDORS TO CREATE CHECKS TO PAY STATE AND LOCAL TAXES AND FEES TO TO PAY VENDORS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO THEIR CANNABIS BUSINESS THREE TO PAY RENT. AND FOR TO PURCHASE STATE AND LOCAL BONDS AND OTHER DEBT INSTRUMENTS WITH IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE DONE THIS A WAY TO CREATE A CLOSED LOOP SYSTEM. THAT WILL HAVE ITS OWN INSURANCE AND WON'T INNER INTEGRATE WITH THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE FEDERAL SYSTEM OUTSIDE OF HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE SYSTEM WORKS. THIS IS AS CLOSE AS WE CAN GET UNTIL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CHANGES ITS POLICY I BELIEVE WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO STEP FORWARD FOR PUBLIC SAFETY PURPOSES. FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR THE STATE TO INCREASE THE ABILITY TO GAIN TAXES AND THE LIKE. WHICH IS BEEN SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING AS WE'VE SEEN RECENTLY AS A RESULT OF THE PASSAGE OF THIS ACT I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENT THAN -- COLLEAGUES AYE AYE I APPLAUD MY COLLEAGUE ONCE AGAIN FOR USING HIS -- CREED OF MINE TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS AND THIS WE DEFINITELY NEED A SOLUTION IN THIS CATEGORY. AS YOU KNOW MY I BROUGHT FORWARD A RESOLUTION RECENTLY -- THAT WAS PASSED I THINK UNANIMOUSLY OUT OF OF THE LEGISLATURE THAT. BIRDS OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO RECLASSIFY MARIJUANA FROM A SCHEDULE ONE DRUG AND BASICALLY DECLASSIFYING GET. SO THAT WE CAN -- RESEARCH -- MARIJUANA PROPERLY AND SO THAT WE CAN BAND. RIGHT NOW EVERYTHING'S GOING TO BE DONE IN CASH. AND WHEN YOU HAVE A CASH BUSINESS IT BRINGS IN BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR. WHILE I'M SURE WE HAVE SOME HONEST VENDORS OUT THERE THAT WANT TO ENSURE THAT THEY'RE PAYING THEIR TAXES. I CAN GUARANTEE YOU THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS LOSING NOT MILLIONS BUT PROBABLY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IF NOT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS A YEAR IN TAX REVENUE -- BECAUSE THEY SIMPLY CANNOT -- WRITE A CHECK -- TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY GOT TO COME IN WITH WILL BERYL'S TO KERRY AND ALL THE CASH AND IF THEY'RE HONEST HONEST VENDORS AND WANTED. TO ALLOW THE STATE TO RECEIVE THE TAX MONEY. BUT IN ADDITION TO HAVING WILL BARRELS TO CARRY THEIR CASH AND YOU CAN IMAGINE THE FEAR THAT THEY MUST HAVE. IN WALKING AND DRIVING AROUND WITH TENS OF THOUSANDS OR HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS IN THEIR CARS OR TRUCKS -- TO SAFELY GET THE MONEY TO THE APPROPRIATE. ENTITIES TO PAY TAXES ARE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES TO PAY THEIR WAGES. SO THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE UNTIL SUCH TIME THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WAKES UP. AND RE CLASSIFIES MARIJUANA FOR IT'S CERTAINLY LEGITIMATE USES AS A MEDICINE TO TREAT THE AILING -- AND PROVIDES FOR PUBLIC SAFETY IMPROVEMENTS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA TO GET THEIR FAIR SHARE THEIR ON A SHARE OF TAXES IT SHOULD BE PAID ON THIS COMMODITY A FEW OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR FOR THOSE REASONS.

THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE THE FLEXIBILITY -- FOR THESE TEN PILOTS CITIES AND EITHER THE MAYOR OR THE CITY COUNCIL IN EACH OF THESE PILOTS CITIES HAS ASKED TO BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL THEY HAVE SAID. TO US THAT WE WANT THIS FLEXIBILITY -- THEY WILL BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH A PROCESS CAN BE A COMMUNITY -- TASK FORCE -- AND THEN FORMULATE THEIR OWN LOCAL PUBLIC SAFETY PLAN AND TRANSPORTATION PLAN AND ACT AS A CITY COUNCIL -- WORK COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- AND THEN SUBMIT THAT PLAN -- TO THE STATE -- BEFORE -- THE EXTENDED HOURS COULD GO INTO AFFECTS EACH INDIVIDUAL VENUE WOULD STILL HAVE TO APPLY TO ABC PER THE NORMAL PROCESS IS A VERY PROCESS INTENSIVE SITUATION -- AND THERE ARE PLENTY OF GUARD RAILS IN ADDITION CITIES -- WILL HAVE A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IT'S NOT JUST ON ON SWITCH OUR OFF SWITCH FOR THEIR ENTIRE CITY. THEY CAN DECIDE THAT ONLY ONE NEIGHBORHOOD OR ON ST OR ONE DISTRICT WILL BE INCLUDED THEY COULD DECIDE THAT IT'LL ONLY HAPPEN ON FRIDAY SATURDAY NIGHTS OR ONLY ONE NIGHT A YEAR IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANT -- NIGHT LIFE IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY INTO OUR CULTURE AND WE SHOULD GIVE OUR CITIES THE FLEXIBILITY -- TO DECIDE WHEN THAT MY LIFE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER DEBATER DISCUSSION [inaudible] SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I WANTED -- TO THANK THE AUTHOR OF THIS ON THIS BILL -- FOR HIS ATTENTION TO DETAIL AND A WILLINGNESS TO CHAT WITH ME AND THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF FRESNO THE REASON WHY SUPPORT IT THROUGH THE COMMITTEE PROCESS. IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE DRINKING OUR SHOULD ALWAYS BE EXTENDED -- TO WHAT IT IS NOW BUT IT EMPOWERS THE LOCAL AUTHORITIES -- NAMELY -- THE CITY COUNCIL OR THE MAYOR WHATEVER THE RESPECTIVE AUTHORITY MAY BE TO MAKE THE DECISIONS IN THEIR OWN RIGHT THEY MAY DECIDE. TO EXTEND THE HOURS THEY MAY DECIDE NOT TO EXTEND THE HOURS FOR LIMITED IN OTHER FASHIONS AS WAS DESCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR AND THAT IS THE REASON WHY THE CITY OF FRESNO -- HAS SUPPORTED THIS IN EXPRESS THEIR SUPPORT TO ME WHICH IS WHY I'M OFFERING MY SUPPORT -- TO TO THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB -- FIFTY EIGHT TO ME. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THIS IS ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL -- IT'S ALSO ABOUT -- PROMOTING -- TERRORISM IN SOME OF OUR CITIES AS AN EXAMPLE AND CITY OF PALM SPRINGS IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS MEASURE. PALM SPRINGS THE CITY OF FORTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. IT HAS OVER A MILLION TOURISTS. THAT COME IN EVERY SINGLE YEAR -- DROPPING A LOT OF MONEY OFF -- IN SALES TAX IN T. O. T. TAXES AND AND THEY SEE THIS AS AS A WAY TO COMPLEMENT THE THEIR GROWING. TOURISM BUSINESS. THERE. AS THE AUTHOR MENTIONED THERE'S THE EXHAUSTIVE ABC PROCESS THAT. HAS TO BE UNDERTAKEN BEFORE. THEY COULD BE GRANTED THIS. THIS -- OPPORTUNITY TO EXTEND THEIR HOURS BYE BYE. TO BUT REALLY FOR THOSE OF US THAT CAME FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT WE APPRECIATE WHEN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DOESN'T DICTATE. HOW WE DO OUR BUSINESS AND THIS IS ONLY ALLOWING THOSE MUNICIPALITIES A CHOOSE? TO EMBARK ON THESE INCREASED HOURS TO DO SO WE'RE NOT MANDATING THAT THEY DO OR NOT MANDATING THAT THEY DON'T. AND THERE'S AN EXTENSIVE PROCESS TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY DO DO IT. THEY DO IT IN THE SAFEST WAY POSSIBLE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. INTEREST SO FOR THOSE REASONS I URGE A YES VOTE ON SB FIFTY EIGHT APPRECIATE THE OFFER FOR BRINGING FORWARD. THANK YOU CENTER STONE SENATOR CENTER GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I TOO WOULD LIKE TO APPLAUD THE AUTHOR FOR MAKING SURE THAT LOCAL CONTROL IS IN FORCE AND WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LET OUR LOCAL -- INDIVIDUALS ARE LOCAL ELECTED TO MAKE GOOD DECISIONS ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THEIR COMMUNITYBUT I ALSO WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR A MEETING WITH ME AND EN THEM INCLUDING THE TWENTY NINE PALMS MISSION A BAND OF MISSION INDIANS. ALTHOUGH A SOVEREIGN NATION THEY WOULD NEED SOME TYPE OF EXCLUSION BECAUSE OF COMPACT RT NEGOTIATED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN SO I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU PUTTING THAT IN YOUR BILL SO THANK YOU SIR.

SENATE BILL ONE THIRTY BY SENATOR GALGIANI AN ACT RELATING TO FIRE PREVENTION SENATOR GALGIANI THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB ONE THIRTY DIRECTS CAL FIRE TO CREATE. A PERMANENT GRANT PROGRAM TO INSTALL AND IMPLEMENT AN EMERGENCY FIRE SIREN WARNING SYSTEM FOR CITIES THAT ARE DEEMED BY CAL FIRE TO BE AND HIVE. FIRE HAZARD ZONES IN ORDER TO NOTIFY AND ALERT THE PUBLIC IN A TIMELY MANNER. THE SPEED OF RECENT CALIFORNIA WILDFIRES IS FORCING US TOWARDS A MULTI PRONGED APPROACH TO NOTIFY PEOPLE IMMEDIATELY THIS BILL ADDS ANOTHER LAYER TO IMPROVE CURREN ALERT SYSTEMS WHERE OTHER TECHNOLOGIES MIGHT FAIL. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER GALGIANI USER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM IS OUR DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I JUST HAD A FEW CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR BILL -- SENSE OF LANDOWNERS ELECTED TO LIVE IN A WILD FIRES OWN. WHICH IS A PERSONAL CHOICE WHY WHY SHOULD ALL CALIFORNIANS FUND FOR SIRENS. AND WITH SENATE BILL EIGHT THIRTY THREE BY MCGUIRE WHICH WE NOW WE'RE SAYING WE SHOULD HAVE A SECONDARY AGENCY CAL FIRE BE INVOLVED BESIDES THE OFFICE OF INTO OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. AND I JUST WONDER WILL THE SIRENS BE ELECTRIC POWERED OR HAND CRANK TO BECAUSE WE'VE HAD UTILITIES TURNED OFF THE ELECTRICITY [inaudible] AND FOURTHLY AREN'T AREN'T CONCEPTS LIKE THIS BETTER ADDRESSED BY ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS. YOU KNOW I THINK IS A WORTHY BILL BUT I JUST. AS A YOU KNOW KIND OF A LIBERTARIAN LEANING PERSON. I I I DID JUST SEEMS THAT PEOPLE SHOULD OWN THEIR OWN DECISIONS TO BE PERSON RESPONSIBLE. FOR TAKING CARE OF THEMSELVES IF THEY'VE ELECTED TO LIVE. IN A WILDLAND URBAN INTERFACE IS OWN OR IN THE MIDDLE OF A FOREST. AND SO WITH THAT I JUST JUST HAD SOME CONCERNS AND MISGIVINGS ALTHOUGH I THINK IT I AND I UNDERSTAND. WHAT IT'S ABOUT BUT I JUST WONDER WHY? SACRAMENTO SHOULD BE DICTATING THE USE OF THIS. MONEY SO I JUST HAVE A HESITANCY AND I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR FOR BILL THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THANK YOU SIR MORE LIKE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR BORCHERS. I CERTAINLY NOT MATTER PRESIDENT -- CERTAINLY RESPECT -- MY COLLEAGUES -- OUR THOUGHTS DEFINITELY IN A MORE LIBERTARIAN LEANING. BUT I THINK WHEN WE CONSIDER TSUNAMIS EARTHQUAKES EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS SHOULD EXTEND TO THE ENTIRE STATE. AND EVEN THOUGH INDIVIDUALS -- DESIRE TO LIVE WHEREVER THEY CHOOSE I DON'T THINK EVERYONE CAN CONTEMPLATE THE ON CONTEMPLATED. I DON'T THINK WE UNDERSTOOD THE SEVERITY OF THE THE FORCE FIRES ON THE WILDFIRES THAT WOULD IN GULF AS OF THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS. SO I BELIEVE THIS IS A STEP FORWARD I THINK IT'S MERITORIOUS AND CERTAINLY WORTH. LOOKING AFTER -- THE FOLKS THAT LIVE THERE GOD WE COULD ALSO HAVE A SITUATION WHERE -- THERE COULD BE A MASS EXODUS IF WE DON'T MAKE CERTAIN PRECAUTIONS AND PUT THEM INTO PLACE SO I APPLIED -- THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND WOOD BEES WILL BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY. THANK YOU CENTER BORDERS ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE CENTER GALGIANI MAKE CLOTHES -- YES. ONE AND THE COST IS BETWEEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AND WE ARE NOT DICTATING SPECIFICS TO CAL FIRE BUT RATHER ALLOWING FOR THE FLEXIBILITY SO THAT THEY CAN COME UP WITH THE PROGRAM THAT MAKES MOST SENSE. I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE MOVED INTO -- FIRESTONE'S THAT AT ONE TIME WERE NOT WHAT THEY ARE TODAY BECAUSE OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND ALL THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE KNOW BUT I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN NEVER PUT A PRICE ON LIFE. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE MANY THINGS THAT DIDN'T GO AS THEY SHOULD HAVE GONE DURING THESE HORROR FLICK FIRES THAT HAVE OCCURRED BUT WE DO KNOW THAT WITH A SIREN WHEN IT GOES OFF IT ALERTS PEOPLE THAT THERE IS SOMETHING THAT'S WRONG AND THAT THEY SHOULD PAY ATTENTION. SO IF THEY'RE SLEEPING AND SOMETHING HAPPENS AT TWO IN THE MORNING THEY WOULD BE AWAKENED BY A SIREN THERE ARE COMMUNITIES IN THIS STATE WHERE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS IS A KIND OF MONEY TO THEM IF THEY'RE A VERY VERY SMALL COMMUNITY. AND WHILE THEY MIGHT WANT TO TAKE THIS LIFESAVING MEASURE UP FRONT IF THEY DON'T HAVE THE FINANCES TO DO SO RIGHT AWAY THEY'RE PUTTING THEMSELVES AT RISK. I BELIEVE THIS IS A VERY MODEST MEASURE AND AGAIN WE GIVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO CAL FIRE TO PUT INTO PLACE WHAT WORKS BEST AND WE DON'T DICTATE THE EXACT TECHNOLOGY BUT RATHER. A SIREN SO THAT. THOSE WHO ARE IN DANGER ARE AWAKENED AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO RESPOND TO GET OUT SAFELY I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GALGIANI ALL DEBATE HAVING CEASED MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN [inaudible] I ARCHULETA [inaudible] I ATKINS FOR JUST [inaudible] I BRADFORD.

PRICE THIRTY SEVEN NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES FILE ITEM. SEVENTY THREE FILE ITEM SEVENTY THREE SENATOR WIENER. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE READ. SENATE BILL ONE FORTY TWO BY SENATOR WIENER AN ACT RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT SENATOR WIENER. pPRESIDENT. SB. ONE FORTY TWO WE'LL MAKE IT EASIER FOR NEW MOTHERS TO RETURN TO WORK. WHILE ALSO CONTINUING TO BREAST FEED -- THEIR NEWBORNS -- RIGHT NOW TOO MANY WOMEN ARE FACED WITH A CHOICE DO I RETURN TO WORK AND STOP BREAST FEEDING. OR DO I BREASTFEED MY CHILD TO ENSURE THAT CHILD'S HEALTH. AND DELAY RETURNING TO WORK AND THAT IS A FALSE CHOICE ODDS ARE SB ONE FORTY TWO WILL PUT STANDARDS IN PLACE -- TO MAKE SURE THAT -- BED WORKPLACES ARE PROVIDING THE ABILITY FOR WOMEN TO EXPRESS MAIL. OUR RIGHT NOW -- THE RULE IS THAT YOU CAN'T FORCE A WOMAN TO EXPRESS MILK IN A BATHROOM. AND WHILE THAT IS A VERY IMPORTANT MINIMUM STANDARD -- WE NEED TO GO BEYOND -- THE BILL AND IN GENERAL REQUIRES THAT WOMEN HAVE A PRIVATE SPACE AND I CAN BE A TEMPORARY PRIVATE SPACE OR AN ACTUAL ROOM. WITH A TABLE WITH A CHAIR WITH AN ELECTRIC OUTLET -- AND NEARBY RUNNING WATER AND REFRIGERATION IT'S QUITE BASIC. THE BILL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY -- TO BUSINESSES -- BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES. ARKAN CECA HARDSHIP -- IN ADDITION -- WE UNDERSTAND A DIFFERENT EMPLOYMENT SETTINGS ARE DIFFERENT AND SO THE BILL DOES NOT MICROMANAGE HOW THESE PRIVATE SPACES ARE PROVIDED THERE ARE SOME INDUSTRIES BUT ALSO -- RECEIVE -- SPECIAL -- FLEXIBILITY INCLUDING AGICULTURE AND THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY -- WE KNOW -- THAT CHILDREN -- HAVE SAID THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT HEALTH BENEFITS NOT TO BREAST FEEDING -- WE ALSO NOTE THAT IT IS IMPORTANT FOR WOMEN TO BE ABLE TO CHOOSE FOR THEMSELVES WHETHER TO RETURN TO WORK -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM DEBATE OR DISCUSSION WILL START WITH THE SENATOR LEYVA IN AND GO FROM THERE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS AYE RISES THAT CHAIR OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR HIS. STEADFAST SUPPORT OF THIS ITS REALLY SHOCKING WHEN YOU THINK YOU KNOW ERR A WOMAN HAS A CHILD SHE WANTS TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND BREAST FEED THAT CHILD. SHE CAN'T TAKE SIX MONTHS OFF BECAUSE THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS SIX MONTHS PAID LEAVE. SO ALL WE'RE ASKING EMPLOYERS TO DO IS MAKE SURE THERE'S A SPACE SO THAT THE WOMAN CAN EXPRESS FOR MILK AND FEED HER CHILD. OVER THE YEARS I'VE SEEN WOMEN IN CLOSETS I'VE SEEN WOMEN IN THE BATHROOM TRYING TO EXPRESS THEIR MILK. AND IT'S JUST SHOCKING THAT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN WE HAVE NOT DONE A BETTER JOB OF ACCOMMODATING WOMEN WHO ARE LITERALLY RAISING OUR FUTURE SO THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY [inaudible] THANK YOU. SENATOR GROWTH THE FORESHORES THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IN RESPONSE TO MY COLLEAGUES. COMMENTS ABOUT BEING IN THE BATHROOM AND DOING LACTATION THOSE EMPLOYER SHOULD BE CITED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS BECAUSE IT'S AGAINST THE LAW FOR THEM TO DO THAT. IT ISREQUIRED BY EMPLOYERS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A LACTATION STATIONER LACTATION ROOM. AND WE DO PROVIDE THAT TO IN THE WORKPLACE THAT I HAVE AND I KNOW MANY OTHER EMPLOYERS DO. THIS PARTICULAR BILL WILL CREATE A PAGA PENALTY WHICH THIRTY THOUSAND EMPLOYERS ARE SUBJECT TO POCKET PENALTIES WHICH IS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AND IT'S JUST A LITIGATION HELL HOLE FOR EMPLOYERS. POCKET WAS CREATED -- IN TWO THOUSAND AND SIX IN THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION WILL CREATE ANOTHER AVENUE OF OPENING FOR TRIAL LAWYERS TO COME IN AND SAY THEY'RE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL THAT'S BEEN DENIED THE LACTATION STATION BUT THE ONLY THING THAT REALLY INTERESTED IN. OUR THEIR WEIGHT STATEMENTS BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE IN CORRECT THING ON THEIR WEIGHT STATEMENTS WHETHER IT'S A PERIOD A COMMA A DASH OR A DATE. THEY WILL HAVE ALMOST -- MILLIONS UPON MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FINES AND NOT ALMOST THE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF FINES BECAUSE THEY AT IT VERY QUICKLY. THE OTHER THING THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT DO IS IT'S NOT NARROWLY DESIGNED FOR SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES WHEN I HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL. I WAS ACTUALLY AT ONE OF MY CLIENTS SITES WHICH IS A WELDING FABRICATION FACILITY NOT NECESSARILY A WOMAN STILL BUT WOMEN ARE GETTING INTO THAT INDUSTRY. BUT OTHER THE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO EMPLOYEES THAT ARE IN% THAT FACILITY ONLY TWO WERE WOMEN AND THEY OPERATE IN THE OFFICE AND ONE IS A PAINTER AND INDUSTRIAL PAINTER. AND TO REQUIRE BECAUSE OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THAT FACILITY FIVE OR SIX LACTATION STATIONS BASED ON THIS BILL WOULD BE COMPLETELY IRRATIONAL FOR AN EMPLOYER. SO I WOULD ASK THE AUTHOR TO CONSIDER MAKING AMENDMENTS FOR A SPECIFIC EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYERS THAT. I DON'T SEE TRADITIONALLY DON'T EMPLOY WOMEN BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WOMEN ARE GAINFULLY BEING EMPLOYED IN MANY MANY INDUSTRIES. BUT THERE HAS TO BE SOME TYPE OF AN EXCEPTION BASED ON SQUARE FOOTAGE -- JUST BECAUSE THE SQUARE FOOTAGE OF THE FACILITY THAT THAT MAY NOT EMPLOYEE THAT NUMBER OF WOMEN THE OTHER THING IS -- IN THIS BILL LIKE I SAID WHEN I ADDRESS THE POCKET ISSUE THERE'S ALSO THE LITIGATION PORTION OF THIS BILL WHICH IS EXTREMELY HARMFUL TO EMPLOYERS AND ALL WHO WANT TO DO IS BE. TO CREATE A JOB AGAIN I THINK EMPLOYERS SHOULD PROVIDE A LACTATION STATION FOR WOMEN WHO NEED TO HAVE BREAST FEEDING THEY NEED TO BE QUIET IT NEEDS TO HAVE A LOCKED DOOR. IT NEEDS TO BE A PLACE WHERE THEY CAN LACTATE APPROPRIATELY WE JUST RE CONVERTED ONE OF OUR OFFICES BUT AS SO FAR RECLINER IN THEIR AT TV IF SHE WANTED TO WATCH TV BECAUSE WE HAD. THREE WOMEN IN OUR OFFICE IT WAS LIKE TELL THEM TO QUIT DRINKING THE WATER RIGHT BECAUSE THEY WERE. EVERYBODY WAS HAVING BABIES WHICH IS GOOD. AND ANYWAY SO I AT WE COULD BE CONVERTED IN OFFICE AND WE MADE IT VERY ACCOMMODATING AND I THINK EMPLOYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE ENOUGH TO DO THAT. AGAIN THERE IS ALREADY A LEGISLATION IN PLACE IN THE LAW ALREADY SAYS THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT WHICH IS FUNDED BY PAGA SOME WAY. CAN GO OUT AND ENFORCE THESE -- EMPLOYERS TO COMPLY WITH A LACTATION STATION THAT IS APPROPRIATE FOR ALL WOMEN THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR WIENER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS -- FROM THE MINORITY LEADER -- SAYS TO A FEW THINGS FIRST OF ALL EVEN THOUGH IT IS THE LAW NOW THAT YOU CAN'T FORCE A WOMAN TO LACTATE IN THE BATHROOM -- THAT IS A BASELINE STANDARD AND AS THE CENTER OF DECEMBER ANY YOU KNOW COUNTY MENTION. THERE ARE STILL WOMEN WHO ARE LACTATING AND BROOM CLOSET. WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING OUT TO THEIR VEHICLE TO DO IT IN A CAR INALL ON A HOT DAY. WE WITH THE STANDARDS ARE NOT WHERE THEY NEED TO BE -- AND TO BE VERY CLEAR THIS BILL PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY FOR EXAMPLE MULTI UNIT COMMERCIAL SPACE. CAN SARE A LACTATION SPACE IN ADDITION IF YOU ARE LET'S SAY A SMALL RETAIL ESTABLISHMENT YOU COULD EVEN HAVE A TEMPORARY SPACE THAT YOU PUT UP IT DOESN'T EVEN HAVE TO BE A PERMANENT. ROOM WE HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY OVER THE LAST YEAR WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ON THIS BILL IN A MADE AMENDMENTS IN RESPONSE TO FEEDBACK FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY WE WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE AN OPEN DOOR -- AND TO BE FLEXIBLE AND TO BE COLLABORATIVE WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY THEM FINALLY -- THIS BILL DOES NOT CONTAIN DOES NOT CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. THAT WAS REMOVED FROM THE BILL -- IT YOU CAN CURRENTLY TODAY SU UNDER PAGA. FOR IF THE IF YOU'RE BEING FORCED FOR EXAMPLE TO LACTATE AND A BATHROOM THIS DOESN'T CREATE ANY NEW CAUSE OF ACTION IT'S SIMPLY CREATES NEW STANDARDS -- AND THESE ARE STANDARDS OF FRANKLY ARE LONG OVERDUE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

ANTI DISCRIMINATION ORDINANCE RELATING TO EMPLOYMENT. AND OFFER EVEN FURTHER PROTECTIONS THE CALIFORNIA WORKERS. EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION IS RAMPANT IN CALIFORNIA CONSEQUENCES ARE FELT GREAT IS IN BLACK AND BROWN COMMUNITIES WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE CALIFORNIA'S FAIR EMPLOYMENT LAWS WORKERS ARE BETTER PROTECTED FROM DISCRIMINATION BASED ON THEIR RACE.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I ALSO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS BILL I I BELIEVE IN MPOWER MENTION ALLOWING OTHERS TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES. BUT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT CREATING A NEW LAYER OF GOVERNMENTS. AND I'M VERY CONCERNED WHEN THESE EMPOWERED. WITH THOSE EMPOWER GQ'S MISTER ABBAS THROWN RULES AND GUIDELINES THE PAPILLA MANDATE. CONSEQUENTLY MY MISGIVINGS GIVE ME PAUSE ABOUT SB -- TWO ONE EIGHT IF SOMETHING IS GOOD FOR ONE LOCAL GOVERNMENT IT SHOULD BE GOOD FOR ALL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE CHANGED. THEN THEY SHOULD BRING THOSE CHANGES TO US WE WRITE THE BILLS AND THEN EVERYONE UNIFORMLY WOULD BE -- ABIDING BY THE SAME STATUTES AROUND THE STATE SO I I RECOMMENDED NO VOTE ON SB. TWO ONE EIGHT THANK YOU CENTER MORE LIKE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION [inaudible] SENATOR GROVE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MY COLLEAGUE OF MINE MIGHT DOWN I APOLOGIZE. I I JUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL AGAIN. THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS OVERSEAS ALL EMPLOYERS WHICH IT OVERSEAS DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AND LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT. AND THEY HAVE ALREADY IN PLACE BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA PASSED BY THIS BODY. IT'S DISCRIMINATORY STANDARDS FOR EMPLOYMENT AND AND HOUSING YOU CANNOT DISCRIMINATE AGAINST RACE COLOR ANCESTRY NATIONAL ORIGIN RELIGION CREED AGE OVER FORTY DISABILITY MENTAL AND PHYSICAL. SEX GENDER INCLUDING PREGNANCY CHILDBIRTH BREAST FEEDING OR OTHER RELATED MEDICAL CONDITION SEXUAL ORIENTATION GENDER IDENTITY GENDER EXPRESSION. MEDICAL CONDITION GENETIC INFORMATION MARITAL STATUS MILITARY AND VETERANS SERVICES OR POLITICAL AFFILIATION. SO WE ALREADY HAVE THINGS IN PLACE THAT. RESTRICT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYERS SHOULD NOT DISCRIMINATE BUT THEY RESTRICT EMPLOYERS FROM DISCRIMINATING AGAINST ANY EMPLOYEE FOR ANY OF THOSE REASONS. TO ADD ANOTHER LAYER THAT EMPLOYERS WILL HAVE -- TO ADDRESS AND MAKING IT DIFFERENT FROM MULTI IMPLEMENT PLAYERS AND MULTI COUNTY SO MAYBE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SAYS YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T WEAR BLUE SHIRTS OR WHATEVER THE CASE AY BE AND THEN. AND THEN IT'S DIFFERENT IN THE COUNTY THAT YOU OPERATE AND YOU HAVE COMPANIES THAT OPERATE DIFFERENT COUNTIES IT JUST MAKES IT ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR JOB CREATORS TO OPERATE IN THIS STATE. THEY ALREADY HAVE STATE ENFORCEMENT STANDARDS AGAIN ENFORCED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS THAT REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO ADHERE TO THIS. TO THIS STRICT STANDARD WHICH THEY SHOULD BUT TO ALLOW ANOTHER LEVEL OF GOVERNMENT TO HEAR NEW RULES AND NEW REGULATIONS IN DIFFERENT COUNTIES. IT DOESN'T WORK FOR JURISDICTIONAL REASONS FOR EMPLOYERS AND CREATING AN EXTRA LAYER OF GOVERNMENT SO I WOULD ASK THAT. YOU OPPOSE THIS BILL. THANK YOU SIR GROVE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR BRADFORD YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT ASISTIR APPOINTED STATED THERE ARE PLENTY MEASURES IN PLACE BUT CURRENTLY. THOSE APARTMENTS ARE GROSSLY UNDERSTAFFED OVER TWENTY FOUR THOUSAND CLAIMS ARE FILED EACH YEAR. THE MAJORITY OF THEM TAKING NINETY DAYS TO BE RESOLVED AND MANY OF THEM WERE NEVER RESOLVED THIS PROVIDES AN EXTRA LAYER OF MAKING SURE WE IMPLEMENT THOSE STATE AND FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT EXIST. AND EMPOWER LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO DO THE SAME -- WE'RE NOT LOOKING TO CREATE A HODGEPODGE OF REGULATORY -- OVERSIGHT AS RELATES TO DISCRIMINATION BUT ALL IN POWER IN THOSE COMMUNITIES TO DO IT BECAUSE AGAIN. CURRENTLY THE STATE IS UNDERSTAFFED AND OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS UNDERSTAFFED DEALING WITH DISCRIMINATION I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE.

SO AND SOME OF THESE CASES CAN GET PROCESS VERY QUICKLY AND SOME OF THEM TAKE A LONG TIME DEPENDING ON THE ON THE THE DETAILS OF THE CASE SOMETIMES THERE'S A LOT OF EVIDENCE TO BE PRESENTED. IT EIGHT I THINK FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT -- WE MIGHT BE OF DIFFERING OPINIONS WHICH IS IS ENTIRELY OKAY -- MY CONCERN THOUGH IS THAT. FOR pASYLUM CASES THAT CAN CONTINUE ON FOR YEARS AND YEARS THAT. THE USE OF CAL GRANTS FOR THE ELIGIBILITY FOR CREEK CAL GRANTS -- COULD INSTEAD BE GOING -- TO NATIONALIZED -- OR NATURAL BORN U.

TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS SO IT REALLY IS A SMALL -- COST I I I I I WOULD I WOULD SHARE THAT CONCERN IF IT WERE A A LARGER PORTION. OF OF OF OF PEOPLE BY IT IS SUCH A SMALL COSTS AND THERE ARE SOME VERY SYMPATHETIC CASES THAT HAVE COME TO MY ATTENTION THAT. GOT ME TO THE PLACE WHERE I WANTED TO RUN THIS BILL -- ITSELF A IT'S A IT'S IT'S NOT A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S REALLY NOT A LOT OF PEOPLE YOU GOT TO THINK ABOUT IT THERE'S THEY'RE NOT THAT MANY IN THIS CASE. IN IN THIS CATEGORY AND THEN YOU HAVE TALK ABOUT FOLKS WHO WOULD WHO WOULD BE ELIGIBLE AND ENGAGING IN AN EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM LIKE THIS. SO FOR THAT REASONI'M I I I DECIDED TO GET THE BILL.

TO UC AND CSU GRADUATE STUDENTS ALLOWING THEM TO USE EXISTING DREAM LOAN PROGRAM FUNDS. IN TOTAL THERE IT ESTIMATED FIVE HUNDRED STUDENTS IN BOTH THE UC AND CAL STATE UNIVERSITY COMBINED.

TO TO GRADUATE STUDENTS. HOUSE ALWAYS MAKE THIS SAID THAT THIS THIS COMMENT I THINK -- THERE IS ONE YEAR OLD TIME SENATOR BORCHERS YOU'RE SPEAKING ON YOUR OWN TIME YEAH QUESTION A QUEUE YOU KNOW WHEN YOUR CHILD IS MAYOR QUICK STATEMENT -- REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN DISAGREE ON THE SOCIAL BENEFITS -- IN THE ELIGIBILITY FOR THOSE SOCIAL BENEFITS INCLUDING -- SCHOOLING I PERSONALLY AM OF THE OPINION THAT THAT WE SHOULD. NOT IGNORE THOSE THAT ARE HERE -- WITHOUT DOCUMENTATION BECAUSE THAT IS A REALITY ESPECIALLY IN MY IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS VERY MUCH A REALITY -- BUT I HAVE. DIFFICULTY. EXTENDING SOCIAL DOLLARS ARE FOR THOSE THAT ARE WITHOUT LEGAL STATUS. TO THE DETRIMENT OF THOSE THAT HAVE LEGAL STATUS WHETHER THEY'RE NATURAL BORN OR NATURALIZED -- SO I THINK FROM A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT. IT'S ONE THING FOR UNDERGRADUATE. BUT NOW WE'RE AT AN AGE FOR GRADUATE LEVEL EDUCATION. THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS PRESUMPTIVELY ARE CAPABLE OF HAVING BEEN INTEGRATED CAPABLE OF WORKING AND AND IN IMPROVING -- THEIR THEIR PROSPECTS IN THIS COUNTRY SO I THINK -- THERE COULD BE AN ARGUMENT FOR UNDERGRAD THE GRADUATE I THINK IS -- IS ENTITLING -- SOCIAL BENEFITS TO THOSE THAT ARE NOT EVEN ELIGIBLE EVEN IF THEY'RENATURAL BORN OR NATURALIZED AMERICANS THANK YOU.

WHILE THESE BENEFITS OF VISION DENTAL AND HEARING TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL COVERAGE THE INCLUSION OF THESE NON STANDARD BENEFITS INSIDE THE STANDARD MEDIGAP PACKAGE HINDER THE ABILITY OF CONSUMERS. TO MAKE MEANINGFUL COMPARISONS BETWEEN NON MEDICAL BENEFITS DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY IN VARIATION OFFERED BY INSURERS. SENATE BILL FOUR SEVEN SIMPLY PROHIBITS THE PRACTICES AND BEDDING NON MEDICAL BENEFITS INTO THE BODY OF A STANDARD MEDIGAP PLAN. IN LIMIT THOSE BENEFITS TO WRITERS THAT CAN BE SOLD SEPARATELY PRICED SEPARATELY AND HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE OVERALL CLAIMS COST OF A MEDIGAP PLAN. THIS BILL SETS CONSUMER FOCUSED STANDARDS WHICH WILL PROTECT AND ALLOW SENIORS TO FULLY UNDERSTAND ALL ASPECTS OF AN INNOVATIVE PLAN. THAT THEY MAY SEEK TO PURCHASE AGAIN THE BILL DOES NOT GET RID OF THE INNOVATIVE PLANS IT SIMPLY SEGREGATES THEM AS AN INDEPENDENT WRITER. SO HEN YOU'RE COMPARING ONE MEDIGAP PLAN TO ANOTHER.

WORKERS COMPENSATION TO ALL CALIFORNIA PEACE OFFICERS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR EMPLOYING AGENCY. WORKERS COMPENSATION IS SOMETHING THAT EVERY WORKER SHOULD BE ENTITLED. TO ESPECIALLY THOSE WHO INHERENTLY PUT THEMSELVES IN HARM'S WAY DURING THE TIME OF THE OF OF THE CLOCK. CURRENT LAW CREATES PRESUMPTIONS WERE SPECIFIC INJURY OR ILLNESSES ARE LOGICALLY WORK RELATED. BUT GENERALLY AFFORD SEIZE PRESUMPTIONS TO PEACE OFFICERS BASED UPON THEIR EMPLOYING AGENCY RATHER THAN THEIR STATUS AS A DUTIES AS PEACE OFFICERS SO IF YOU WORK AS A PEACE OFFICER ONE FOR ONE AGENCY NOT. AFFORDED THE SAME PROTECTIONS THAN IF YOU WORK FOR AN OTHER AGENCY IT'S THE SAME KIND OF WORK UNFORTUNATELY WE WE DON'T TREAT ALL OFFICERS THE SAME. IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THIS WOULD FIX THAT. OUR STATE PEOPLE CHAVEZ WORKED TIRELESSLY TO PROTECT US AND KEEP US SAFE. WE OWE IT TO THESE OFFICERS TO IN TURN TO WHAT WE CAN TO PROTECT THEM SHOULD THEY BECOME INJURED OR SURE THEY UP UP FIND THEMSELVES.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- WAS ABOUT SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS INVITED. TO GO TO THE STATE ASSOCIATION COUNTY. RETIREMENT SYSTEMS ALSO KNOWN AS SECTORS. AND THEY GIVE ME THE CHALLENGE TO DEBATE MARK SALADINO WHO WAS THE TREASURER TAX COLLECTOR OF LOS ANGELES COUNTY. AND SO THEY COULD THE DEBATE WAS THE DEFINED BENEFIT VERSUS DEFINED CONTRIBUTION AND THEY ALLOWED ME. TO WITH A DEFINED CONTRIBUTION. PERSON SO WE HAD THIS INTERESTING DEBATE I GOT UP AND I SHARED ALL MY CONCERNS ABOUT DEFINED BENEFIT. PLANS AND WHAT KIND OF ABUSES WERE OCCURRING. INCLUDING. HAVING VERY HIGH RATES OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS. AND AND THAT AND THEN IT WAS MARK'S TURN AND MARK IT UP WHEN HE STARTED TALKING ABOUT. SOME OF THE OTHER AREAS THAT NEEDED TO BE IMPROVED AND WHY DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE GETTING TO BE SO EXPENSIVE AND UNSUSTAINABLE. AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT HE BROUGHT UP WAS THE PRESUMPTIVE'S HOW MANY PRESUMPTIVE'S THEY WERE FOR PUBLIC SAFETY. OFFICIALS. AND HOW IT WAS CREATING SUCH HIGH DISABILITY COSTS ARE JUST BECAUSE THIS WAS ANOTHER AREA THAT CAN BE ABUSED SO COLLEAGUES. BRING THAT OVER TO THE WORKERS COMP ARENA I THINK WE'VE GOT TO BE CAREFUL WITH WHAT WE CREATE AS A PRESUMPTIVE WORD NOTHING IS DONE OTHER THAN SAYING BUT YOU ARE IN THIS PROFESSION AND THEREFORE. YOU GET TO GET THIS BENEFIT SO I I THINK WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT WORK CAN BE REDUCED PRESUMPTIVE'S NOT WHERE WE CAN INCREASE THEM. SO I WILL BE A NO VOTE ON SB FOUR ONE SIX THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT.

THAT THEY KNOW THAT WE AS ELECTED AS WHETHER BE CENTERS ASSEMBLY BAND COUNCIL MEMBERS WHATEVER IT MIGHT BE ACROSS THIS NATION ACROSS THE STATE. THAT WE SUPPORT OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORK THEY DO THE SACRIFICES THEY MAKE EVERY DAY. IN THE DANGERS THEY HAVE MAYBE IN THE AUTOMOBILE MAYBE JUST IN THE STREET BUT WHATEVER IT IS THEY NEED TO KNOW THAT WE'RE BEHIND HIM THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I URGE AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR HUESO YOU MAY CLOSE.

A CONDITION IF IT IS NOT WORK RELATED AT THE END THERE'S A PROCESS BUT WALL ALL OUR OFFICERS ARE GOING THROUGH THIS CARE -- THEY THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE ALLOWED TO SPEND -- THIS MONEY OUT OF POCKET. OUR OUR SYSTEM OF HEALTH CARE SHOULD SHOULD SHOULD COVER -- PEOPLE AND AND GIVE THEM THE THE THE CARE THAT THEY NEED BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WHEN WE WE HAVE. A SITUATION IN CALIFORNIA THAT OUR OFFICERS ARE VERY. DANGEROUS POSITIONS AND IT'S HARD HARD GETTING HARDER AND HARDER TO FILL THESE POSITIONS STATEWIDE WE HAVE A LOT OF VACANCIES.

THAT CRISIS OCCURRED AT THE TIME WERE ONLY 15% OF OUR ENERGY MARKET WAS OCCUPIED BY AND SEES OTHER THAN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. PUBLIC A P. UC INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES. AND YET THE IMPACT AS WE KNOW WAS NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY. AND OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS OR ENERGY. LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY. WE NOW HAVE NEARLY 44% OF OUR ENERGY PROVIDED BY EITHER COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATION OR DIRECT ACCESS. AND ALTHOUGH THESE RETAIL CHOICES HAVE GROWN DRAMATICALLY NOT ALL LOAD SERVING IT IS SERVING ENTITIES ARE REGULATED LEAVING THOSE CUSTOMERS POTENTIALLY WITHOUT. KEY CONSUMER AND PRICE PROTECTIONS. LAST YEAR FOLLOWING AN EXTENSIVE SERIES OF PUBLIC UTILITY WORKSHOPS PUBLIC UTILITY COMMISSION WORKSHOPS IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THE FINDING THAT WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR AND DEFINE WHAT WAS CALLED A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. WHICH IS THE SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS BILL. IN ADDITION BY THE GOVERNOR STRIKE TEAM IDENTIFIED IN ITS REPORT THAT HAVING A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT AS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN IN THERE WILD FIRE AND ENERGY FUTURES REPORT. SO THIS MEASURE IN THE LARGER ARCHITECTURE OF WHERE WE'RE GOING AS WE MOVE MORE TOWARD RENEWABLES AND THE AND UNDERLYING ENERGY PROFILE THAT EXISTS IN DELIVERING ELECTRICITY TOOK ALL CALIFORNIANS WE NEED TO PROVIDE FOR A BASIC SAFETY NET FOR ELECTRICITY CUSTOMERS. BY DESIGNATING A PROVIDER OF LAST RESORT. THIS MEASURE DESIGNATES INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES AS PROVIDERS OF LAST RESORT FOR THEIR DISTRIBUTION SERVICE AREAS INCLUDING CUSTOMERS FOR CCA'S AND YES P.

SENATE BILL THREE TWENTY EIGHT BY SENATOR PORTANTINO AND ACTUALLY DO PEOPLE ATTENDANCE SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU ARE MADAM PRESIDENT I MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB -- THREE TWENTY EIGHT A BILL THAT I THINK IS OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. FOR DECADES EDUCATORS HAVE SEARCHED FOR A WAY TO FIND SOMETHING THAT WORKS AND DUPLICATED AND REPLICATED APART ACROSS DEMOGRAPHICS. ACROSS SOCIOECONOMIC STATUS ACROSS [inaudible] GEOGRAPHIC LOCATIONS ACROSS STATES -- THEY'VE ALWAYS STRUGGLE BECAUSE PART OF WHAT MAKES EDUCATION WORK I THE ART OF THE PEOPLE INVOLVED AND IT'S HARD TO REPLICATE. WELL IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AFTER LOOKING AT THREE DECADES THREE DECADES OF RESEARCH THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. RECOMMENDED THAT HIGH SCHOOL AND MIDDLE SCHOOL START TIME BE MOVED [inaudible] DAY. THIRTY AND OVER FOUR HUNDRED SCHOOL DISTRICTS AROUND THE COUNTRY FROM EVERY DEMOGRAPHIC. CHOSE TO FOLLOW THAT RECOMMENDATION OF THE PEDIATRICIANS. AND THE INDEPENDENT THINKERS AT CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. AND THREE DECADES OF RESEARCH AND THEY MOVE THEIR START TIME LATER. AND A REMARKABLE THING STARTED TO HAPPEN. STUDENTS STARTED TO SHOW UP IN CLASSES MORE FREQUENTLY. THEY WERE ALERT. THEY STARTED TO PERFORM BETTER ACADEMICALLY. SO TENANTS WHAT UP GRADUATION RATE WENT UP. AND SOME OTHER REMARKABLE THING STARTED TO HAPPEN. CAR ACCIDENTS WENT DOWN. THE INCIDENCES OF SUICIDAL THOUGHTS WENT DOWN AND I FOR ONE DON'T EVER WANT TO READ IN THE NEWSPAPER READ ANOTHER YOUNG PERSON. WHO'S TAKEN THEIR LIFE THROUGH SUICIDE. AND SO WE KNOW FOR EVERY ADDITIONAL OUR TEENS. SUICIDE GOES DOWN 11%. AND SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE TODAY IS A RESEARCH BASED PROVEN. WAY. TO INCREASE ATTENDANCE AND INCREASE OUR TEENS HEALTH LET ME SAY THAT AGAIN TEST SCORES GO UP. CAR ACCIDENTS AND SUICIDAL THOUGHTS GO DOWN AS LONG WITH DRUG USE MARIJUANA USE OBESITY ALL GO DOWN AS WELL. NOW INITIALLY WHEN IT WAS PROPOSED PEOPLE SAID WELL WHAT ABOUT ZERO PERIOD. WELL WE EXEMPTED OUT ZERO PERIOD. AND THEN THEY SAID WELL WHAT ABOUT. WORKING PARENTS VERY GOOD QUESTION TO ASK AND WE SHOWED THEM THE DATA AND IN PARTICULAR THE RECENT DATA FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON THAT SHOW THE BIGGEST INCREASE. IN ATTENDANCE WAS FROM CHILDREN WORKING PARENT HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE THERE'S A SOCIAL JUSTICE COMPONENT TO THIS BILL AS WELL UNDER THE CURRENT SYSTEM CHILDREN AND WORKING FAMILY HOUSEHOLDS ARE THE MOST SLEEP DEPRIVED CHILDREN. BECAUSE THEY HAVE THE MOST COMPLICATIONS IN THEIR HOUSEHOLD. UNLIKE SUBURBAN CHILDREN WHICH HAVE MORE ADVANTAGES SO THE VERY COHORT. THAT PEOPLE EXPRESSED TO CARE ABOUT SEE SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACADEMIC GAINS AND SOCIAL GAINS AND ATTENDANCE IS INCREASED GREAT QUESTION. THE DATA PROVES ELSE WISE WHEN WE CLARIFIED ZERO PERIOD WHEN WE GAVE IT STAGGER START TIME TO MIDDLE SCHOOL. THE MOST RECENT OBJECTION IS WELL EIGHTY A IS GOING TO SUFFER AGAIN. A GOOD QUESTION TO ASK BUT THE DATA SHOWS THE OPPOSITE ATTENDANCE WILL INCREASE IF THE LA UNIFIED SHOWS A 1% INCREASE IN ATTENDANCE TO THE LATE START. THEY WOULD SEE A TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INCREASE TO THEIR BUDGET. SAID WELL WHAT ABOUT THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS WELL. RAND CORPORATION THAT AN INDEPENDENT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS THAT SHOWS THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY WOULD IMPROVE BY TEN BILLION DOLLARS IN THE FIRST YEAR OF LATE START. HOW MANY BILLS IS THIS FOR PASSED ON SUSPENSIONS WELL GUESS% WHAT SUSPENSIONS GO DOWN DISRUPTIVE BEHAVIOR GOES DOWN OTHER BEHAVIORS IN THE CLASSROOM GO DOWN AFTER THE LATE START? SO FUNDAMENTALLY BY HAVING TEENS SLEEP ACCORDING TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL CLOCK. AND MOVING START TIME ACCORDINGLY WE APPROVE. ATTENDANCE. GRADES AND GRADUATION RATE AND WE DECREASE ALL OF THE THINGS WE DEEPLY CARE ABOUT AND THINGS WE'VE RUN MANY BILLS THAT'S NOT ANECDOTE. THAT'S FACTUAL DATA SUPPORTED THE CONCLUSION SO WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SIR PORTANTINO. ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM [inaudible] SENATOR MORLOCK. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THIS IS IMPORTANT TOPIC SOMEONE NEEDS TO GET UP AND JUST ASK A FEW QUESTIONS TO MAKE SOME OBSERVATIONS I THINK IT WAS. IN THE LOUNGE FOR SOMEONE SAID TO ME. I LIKE PROGRESS IT'S IT'S CHANGE I DON'T LIKE [inaudible] SO A PUSHING BACK THE TIME THAT SCHOOL START. MAKING IT MANDATORY THIS FROM MY UNDERSTANDING NOT OPTIONAL. IS IS A MASSIVE CHANGE THAT WE WILL BE. IMPOSING ON OUR NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE [inaudible] NOT RURAL. SO IF DISRUPTING THE WORK SCHEDULES -- OF PERRANCE IS NOT ENOUGH TO OPPOSE SB. THREE TWENTY EIGHT IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WILL ALSO MAKE A MAD AT A MAJOR IMPACT ON THE TRANSPORTATION FOR GETTING STUDENTS TO SCHOOL. WHICH MEANS THAT THE BUS SYSTEMS FOR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICT WILL ALSO BE MODIFIED AND ARE LOOKING AT INCREASED COSTS. AND I'M REALLY CONCERNED COLLEAGUES ABOUT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEY'RE INCURRING ANYMORE INCREASED COSTS. HAVING LOOKED AT THE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICT. AUDITED FINANCIAL REPORTS IT'S VERY DISCOURAGING AND THE NEW ONES ARE COMING OUT IN THE% BOTTOM. TWELVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THERE. UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT IS GOING UP ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. SO IF THE CLAIMS THAT REVENUES WILL INCREASE THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD FACT. BUT I'M NOT SO SURE IT WILL BE ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE EXPENSES THAT WILL BE INCURRED IN. THE TRANSPORTATION AREA OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT [inaudible] JUNE. THIRTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE SACRAMENTO CITY. UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT HAD AN UNRESTRICTED NET DEFICIT OF FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION. THEY JUST CAME OUT WITH THEIR KAFFIR. A FEW WEEKS AGO. THIS YEAR JUNE THIRTY TWENTY EIGHTEEN IT IS NOW. ONE BILLION. SIXTY FIVE IT'S DOUBLED IN ONE YEAR WHICH COULD BE THE RETIREE MEDICAL WE HAVE SERIOUS FINANCIAL ISSUES. FACING OUR DISTRICT SO BEFORE WE ENCUMBER. THE DISTRICTS ANYMORE LET'S MAKE SURE THEY HAVE STRONG BALANCE SHEETS AND LET'S MAKE SURE THEY HAVE LOCAL CONTROL. AND FOR THOSE REASONS I ENCOURAGE A NO VOTE ON SB. THREE TWENTY EIGHT THANK YOU SIR MORE LIKE SENATOR MITCHELL. THANK YOU CAN A PRESIDENT. BUT CERTAINLY THE SATIN LISTEN TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY GIVE US THE VARIOUS REASONS WHY WE SHOULDN'T SUPPORT THE BILL. IT STRUCK ME THAT AT NO POINT DID ANY OF HIS ARGUMENTS ADDRESS THE NEEDS. OF THE STUDENTS. IN OUR SCHOOL SYSTEM. THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO EDUCATE. OUR KIDS THE ENTIRE SYSTEM. AND SO WHILE I APPRECIATE CHANGES HARD FOR SOME. MANY OF US HAVE TRAVELED AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS SEEN COUNTRIES WHERE KIDS GO TO SCHOOL SIX SEVEN DAYS A WEEK WE'RE CLEAR THAT OUR SEPTEMBER TO JUNE IS BASED ON AN AGRARIAN SYSTEM THAT NO LONGER IMPACTS THE VAST MAJORITY OF SCHOOL STUDENTS IN SCHOOL ACROSS. THIS GREAT STATE. AND YET ON THIS FLOOR WE CONTINUE TO DEBATE SCHOOL READINESS GRADUATION RATES OF THE EMPLOYERS ARE IN OUR DISTRICTS TALK ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT THE NEXT GENERATION OF OF EMPLOYEES ARE INNOVATORS FOR THAT MATTER ARE GOING TO BE PREPARED. TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE GRAY CITY CALIFORNIA. SO I HOPE THAT WE WOULD BE OPEN MINDED ENOUGH. TO RELY ON THE DATA AND RESEARCH. TO REALLY DETERMINE WHAT DO STUDENTS NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. AND BUILD A DISTRICT ANY SYSTEM AROUND THAT. AS OPPOSED TO WHAT HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN OUR PATTERN PRACTICE. AND TO REALLY BE WILLING TO PUSH THE ENVELOPE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DEVELOPING A SYSTEM IN AND FUNDING A SYSTEM. THAT MEETS THEIR FUNDAMENTAL NEEDS FOR THOSE REASONS I AM PROUD TO STAND WITH YOU IN SUPPORT SENATE BILL. THREE TWO EIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR MITCHELL SENATOR MORRELL. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS -- WERE IN A STATE OF FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. TO A LOT OF PEOPLE -- AS WE NOW -- IN THIS -- BILL IS A ONE SIZE FITS ALL. AND I THINK ALL OF US WHENEVER WE SPEAK. TO OUR LOCAL MUNICIPALITIES WE WE ALL TALK ABOUT LOCAL CONTROL AND I'D LIKE TO LEAVE IT WITH LOCAL CONTROL BECAUSE I'VE HAD A NUMBER CALLS FROM. FROM PARENTS M. FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT OPINIONS AND SO I I DO BELIEVE IN LOCAL CONTROL LIKE I DO TRUST THE PARENTS. AS WELL AS THE VERY SCHOOL DISTRICTS MY DOESN'T BUT DISTRICT TO MAKE A BETTER DECISION. TO MAKE THE BEST DECISION FOR THEIR KIDS. AND SO THAT'S WHY I WILL BE A NO VOTE BECAUSE AGAIN I I TRUST THE PARENTS IN THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS -- THE FIGURE THIS OUT SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO. THANK YOU SENATOR MORALE SENATOR PAM. THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH -- MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LIKE KONATA. BUT RATES FOR BRING THIS -- FOR THIS BILL IS BASED ON AS HE OF PRESENT IN THE BEGINNING -- EXTREMELY STRONGLY THE PELLING RESEARCH SHOWING THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A VERY POSITIVE IMPACT. ON OUR KIDS AND OUR ABILITY TO LEARN. AND WHAT WE THINK ABOUT. OUR TEENAGERS WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL WE HAVE A WINDOW OF TIME IN WHICH TO EDUCATE THEM RIGHT LEAD DOWN DAIS. AND IF WE WANT TO BE SURE THAT THEY'RE SUCCESSFUL AND WE OFTEN SAY THAT HERE IN. TO PERHAPS A LITTLE BIT TO ECHO MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOS ANGELES. QUESTION IS IS THAT OUR OUR OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPPOSED TO BE DESIGNED TO HELP OUR STUDENTS. OUR STUDENTS MERELY THERE TO SHOW UP AT A SCHOOL THAT MAY NOT NECESSARILY OPTIMALLY MEET THEIR NEEDS. I APPRECIATE. THAT -- MY GOOD FRIEND IT. IN ORANGE COUNTY MENTIONED WHEN THE SCHOOL DISTRICT MY VERY OWN -- DISTRICT SENATE DISTRICT I WOULD POINT OUT THAT THE CHALLENGES THAT THEY'RE FACING THERE ARE ACTUALLY -- NOT. BECAUSE OF SCHOOL START TIMES IT HAS TO DO WITH OTHER ISSUES -- BUT AGAIN IT WE ARE HERE TO TRY TO BE SURE THAT WE HELP OUR STUDENTS. SO THE EVIDENCE IS THERE THE EVIDENCE IS STRONG. AND THAT IS WHY I AM PROUD -- TO THE ONLY SUPPORT THE BILL TO BE A CO AUTHOR AND I AGAIN WANT TO THANK. MY GOOD FRIEND FOR FOR BEING THIS FOR TO BE SURE WE PUT OUR KIDS FIRST THAT'S WHAT THIS SHOULD BE ABOUT OUR KIDS. AND THEIR LEARNING SHOULD COME FIRST AND WE SHOULD THEN FIGURE OUT HOW WE MAKE -- BASED ON THE EVIDENCE AND HOW WE MAKE. OUR SCHOOLS MOST EFFECTIVE FOR THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR PAN SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I'D LIKE TO APPLY THE AUTHOR FROM THE DILIGENT RESEARCH THAT HE DID DO YOU WANT IT AND THE TO BE HONEST THE FIRST TIME HE CAME TO SPEAK TO ME ABOUT IT I KIND OF JUST LEFT HIM OUT OF MY CHAIR. AM I THOUGHT YOU'RE KIDDING ME BECAUSE I GREW UP IN WE DIDN'T REALLY EVER HAVE A CURFEW BUT WE HAD A WAKE UP TIME RIGHT MY MOM IS THEREFORE CLOCK IN THE MORNING YOU GOT IT YOU DID YOUR CHORES TO DO WE SUPPOSED TO DO. AND THEN YOU WHICH WORK SO AT EIGHT O'CLOCK YOU'RE READY TO GO TO BED -- AND SO I I DID BUT AFTER TALKING TO THE AUTHOR AND LISTENING TO ALL THE DATA IN THE INFORMATION THAT HE PROVIDED THERE IS STUDIES OUT THERE THAT SHOW. THAT -- TEENAGERS THE WAY THEY GROW THE WAY THEIR MIND WORKS -- MELATONIN ISSUES HE DID MAKE A VERY COMPELLING ARGUMENT SO I DID DO THAT DUE DILIGENCE ON MY SIDE REACH OUT TO MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS. BEING FROM A RURAL COMMUNITY AGAIN FROM THE VALLEY MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE VERY VERY MUCH OPPOSED TO IT THE REASON WHY IS BECAUSE IT AFFECTS ED. NINETY END THROUGH TWELFTH GRADE SO THEY'D HAVE TO HAVE TWO SEPARATE TRANSPORTATION BUS SCHEDULES WITH THERE'S VERY LITTLE FUNDING FOR TRANSPORTATION IN THE FIRST PLACE AND IF YOU CAN'T GET STUDENTS. TO SCHOOL TO LEARN -- BASED ON A TRANSPORTATION ISSUE BECAUSE SOME HIGH SCHOOLS ARE YOU KNOW TWELVE FOURTEEN SIXTEEN MILES AWAY FROM WHERE STUDENTS LIVE AND SO THERE'S A HUGE CONCERN ABOUT TRANSPORTATION AND FINDING AND THERE IS A HUGE ISSUE. WITH LOCAL CONTROL AND SETTING THE HOURS AND THEN CONTRACT LABOR AGREEMENTS AS WELL -- WHERE THEY HAVE THE CTA OR THAT THE TEACHERS AT NEGOTIATE WORK SCHEDULES AND SO I DO APPLAUD YOU FOR ALL YOUR DUE DILIGENCE AND THE I I THANK YOU VERY MUCH BUT BECAUSE OF THE DISTRICT A RESPONSE THAT I GOT AND OF COURSE A? YOU KNOW THE DISTRICT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN MY DISTRICT I HAVE TO POSE YOUR BILL BUT I'D I DO THINK YOU WANNA YOU DID BRING ME A LONG WAY SO I APPRECIATE THAT. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN -- LIKE TO ASK A QUESTION THE AUTHOR IN AND TAKE A LOT OF YOU TAKE A QUESTION CENTER PORTENT I WILL TAKE A QUESTION THANK YOU THE GENERAL FUND PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I MEAN RESPONSE TO THE QUESTION IT JUST CAME OUT. ON ICE MASON THE NOTHING IN THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT IF I WAS A SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT ABOUT IT DO WILL START TIME. FOR THE ELEMENTARY'S AT VERSES THE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOLS. NOTHING IN THE BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THE DISTRICT FROM STARTING EVERYBODY THE SAME TIME SO THAT LATER IS THAT CORRECT CORRECT OKAY. THAT WAS THE FIRST THING THE SECOND THING I I JUST WANT TO RESPOND TO THE ISSUE OF THE CONTROL BECAUSE IT'S SOMETHING THAT I SHARE AND I FIND MYSELF -- YOU KNOW NOT VOTING FOR EVERY BILL THAT COMES BEFORE US THAT IMPINGES UPON SCHOOL DISTRICTS OF CONTROL BECAUSE I MYSELF SERVE ON THE SCHOOL BOARD. I AM ALWAYS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THESE KINDS OF ISSUES WHAT BRINGS ME TO SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL IS MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCE HAVING SERVED ON THE SCHOOL BOARD HAVING LOOKED INTO THIS VERY ISSUE BECAUSE I SAW THE SIGN SO YOU SAW -- BUT BACK WHEN I WAS ON THE BOARD AND I LOOKED I KIND OF EXPLORING THE IDEA OF MOVING UP ARE START TIME IN MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND WHAT I WAS TOLD WAS THAT THERE WAS NO WAY WE COULD DO IT OUR ON OUR OWN BECAUSE OF SPORTS SCHEDULES AND THE IMPACT ON ON ON ON THAT WITH REGARDS TO ALL THE OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WE INTERACT WITH AND PLAYED WITH AN ENGAGED WITH. AND SO THIS IS A MOMENT WHERE I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S OKAY FOR US TO BE -- AND PINGING ON LOCAL CONTROL BECAUSE THERE IS A COLLECTIVE ACTION ISSUE HERE -- IT WITH ONE SCHOOL IF IF SCHOOL DISTRICT'S GONNA GO OFF ON THEIR OWN IN DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS IT MESSES UP THE ENTIRE ATHLETIC SYSTEM IN A WAY THAT WILL BE -- VERY PROBLEMATIC AND SO -- THAT THAT THAT THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WHY I THINK -- IT'S IT'S WORTH -- STEPPING IN AND TAKING A STATE ACTION ON ON ON THIS NARROW ISSUE THAT REALLY DOES ULTIMATELY RELATE A GREAT DEAL TO THE BIOLOGICAL PATTERNS AND HEALTH. OF OUR TEENAGERS. THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SENATOR PORTANTINO. IT IS YOUR CLOTHES THANK YOU A MATTER PRESIDENT I CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THE COMMENTS -- DURING MY CLOTHES I KNOW WE WANT TO KEEP MOVING BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT -- FIRST OF ALL THE ACTED THE ECONOMIC QUESTIONS ARE AGAIN THE RIGHT QUESTION TO ASK -- BUT THERE IS NO DATA TO SUPPORT THE NOTION THAT IT'S GOING TO INCREASE COSTS AND ACTUALLY THE RAND CORPORATION STUDY SAYS FOR EVERY DOLLAR SCHOOL DISTRICT INVEST. IN LATE START THEY'RE GONNA RETURN FOR DID FOUR DOLLARS BACK SO THERE'S ECONOMIC DATA TO SHOW THE CONTRARY ON THE BUS SCHEDULES WE TRIED TO BE EXTREMELY SENSITIVE WHICH IS WHY WE SAID A DIFFERENT MINIMUM FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL IN A DIFFERENT MINIMUM. FOR HIGH SCHOOL PRECISELY TO GIVE DISTRICTS THAT FLEXIBILITY. TO WORK OUT THEIR LOGISTICS AND THAT'S A VERY VERY IMPORTANT POINT WE ARE NOT SETTING A HARD TIME. WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT SETS A MINIMUM STANDARD BASED ON RESEARCH FOR HEALTH AND WELFARE? THAT'S NO DIFFERENT THAN SETTING A MINIMUM STANDARD ON LEAD PAINT. OR ON A SPACE THIS YOU SET MINIMUM CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS BASED ON SCIENCE WERE SETTING A MINIMUM HEALTH AND WELFARE STANDARD. BASED ON THE RECOMMENDATION OF PEDIATRICIANS AND THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND THEN FINALLY AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM LOS ANGELES AND THE GOOD PEDIATRICIAN FROM SACRAMENTO POINTED OUT. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT DOING WHAT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF OUR CHILDREN. AND THAT'S NOT A MONETARY CONVERSATION THAT'S A HUMAN. CONVERSATION OUR CHILDREN WILL BE HEALTHIER HAPPIER AND PERFORM BETTER AND FRANKLY TAKE THEIR OWN LIFE. LIFE LESS IF WE DO LATE START AND THE RESEARCHERS IN THEIR CONCLUDING STATEMENT ALWAYS ENDED WITH WE KNOW THERE WILL BE ADULT LOGISTICAL CONCERNS. BUT THE OVERRIDING HEALTH AND WELFARE OF OUR CHILDREN DEMAND THAT WE MAKE THAT STATEMENT NOW I'VE DONE THE IMPOSSIBLE I'VE UNITED RESEARCHERS FROM STANFORD AND CAL. WHO SENT LETTERS IN SUPPORT OF THIS AND I JUST WANT TO READ YOU WHAT IF WITH YOUR PERMISSION PERMISSION TO READ? THE CLOSING STATEMENT. MATTER PRESENT PERMISSION TO READ. WITHOUT OBJECTION GREAT FROM -- MATTHEW WALKER PHD PROFESSOR OF NEUROSCIENCE NEUROSCIENCE AND PSYCHOLOGY DIRECTOR CENTER OF HUMAN SLEEP SCIENCE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY SO ALL THE ABOUT CALIFORNIA'S GO BEARS. HE GOES AS YOU CAN SEE THE SCIENTIFICALLY MEASURABLE SLEEP DEFICIENCY ASSOCIATED WITH EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES RESULT IN MARKED MENTAL PHYSICAL AND ACADEMIC. DAMAGE HE USED THE WORD DAMAGE. IT IS OUR GOAL AS EDUCATORS TO TRULY IS IF OUR GOAL AS EDUCATORS IS TO TRULY EDUCATE. AND NOT RISK THE LIVES. IN THE PROCESS THEN I FEAR WE ARE FAILING OUR NEXT GENERATION WITH UNSUSTAINABLE MODELS OF EARLY SCHOOL START TIMES HE USED DAMAGE AND RISKS TO LIVES. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU FOR AN AYE VOTE TO PUT SCIENCE AND OUR CHILDREN FIRST THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

VICE TWENTY FOUR KNOWS NINE THE MEASURE PASSES. AND WITHOUT OBJECTION WE WILL GO TO FILE ITEM OF ONE OH NINE FILE ITEM ONE OH NINE COLLEAGUES. SENATOR ROTH. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ SENATE BILL THREE OH SEVEN BY SENATOR ROTH AND ACT REALLY IN A WATER. SENATOR ROTH THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT COLLEAGUES. FOR THOSE YOU WERE DOING OTHER THINGS THIS IS THE COULD EASE BILL. BUT THAT WOULD GET YOUR ATTENTION. FOR THE PAST TWENTY YEARS COULD EASE A CORPORATE LANDOWNER IN THE MOJAVE HIS PROPOSED TO PUMP AN AVERAGE OF FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET. OF WATER PER YEAR THAT'S OVER SIXTEEN BILLION GALLONS A YEAR. FOR FIFTY YEARS FROM THE AQUIFER UNDER THE MOJAVE AND SELL IT TO WATER DISTRICTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE AT A PROIT OF COURSE. FOR PURPOSES OF GUARANTEEING WATER SUPPLY TO ABOUT ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND OR MORE. NEW HOMES THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE SCIENCE UNDERLYING THIS PROJECT IS IN SERIOUS CONFLICT AS TO WHAT AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE REALLY IS. AND IF COULD EASE IS WRONG. THAT LEVEL OF PUMPING THE PUMPING PROPOSED. COULD POTENTIALLY DESTROYING. THE MOJAVE DESERT IN THE PROCESS AND BY THE WAY WHEN THE PUMPING STOPS. IMPAIR THE WATER SUPPLY TO THOSE NEW HOMES. NOW THIS BILL SEEKS TO HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON ON THIS MASSIVE WATER EXTRACTION PROJECT. IN THIS VERY FRAGILE ECOSYSTEM THAT HAS EXISTED IN BALLOTS FOR CENTURIES. AND HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON TO ENSURE THAT WE GET THE SCIENCE RIGHT THAT THE SCIENCE IS RECONCILED. THE PROJECT HAS BEEN STALLED. FOR YEARS BECAUSE FRANKLY THE MATH DOESN'T ADD UP. AS I INDICATED KIDDIES WANTS TO PULL FIFTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR OUT AND HAS NEVER CHANGED AS TO THAT AMOUNT. BUT ADMITS THAT THE AQUIFER ONLY REFILLS AT THE RATE OF THIRTY TWO THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR. NOW RENOWNED SCIENTISTS. WORKING WITH THE U. S. GEOLOGICAL SURVEY THE NATIONAL PARK SERVICE AND OTHERS SAY THE REFILL RATE IS MORE LIKE. NOW IF THE CHILL OUT OF THE GEOLOGICAL SURVEY IN THE PARK SERVICE. SCIENCE [inaudible] IS CORRECT. THAT'S AT LEAST FORTY THOUSAND ACRE FEET PER YEAR THAT'S FOURTEEN BILLION GALLONS LESS THAN THE COULD THESE PLANS. PULLING OUT MORE THAN GOES IN. NOW CLEARLY THERE IS A SERIOUS CONFLICT IN THE SCIENCE SOMEWHERE HERE SURROUNDING THIS PROJECT. AND IF COULD DISS MISCALCULATED. THE SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RIGHT NOT ONLY WILL THE ECOSYSTEM IN THE MOJAVE FACE DESTRUCTION BUT AS I INDICATED BEFORE WE HAVE A pSERIOUS PROBLEM WITH THOSE HOMES. HAVE BEEN PROMISED WATER FROM THIS PROJECT. WE THINK THE CONFLICT SHOULD BE RESOLVED BEFORE THE PUMPING STARTS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES NO MORE. NO LESS. NOW YOU. I HAVE HEARD AND LEE OR WILL HEAR A LOT ABOUT SEQUEL. IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS BILL ON THE FLOOR. AND HOW COULD THESE AND IT'S PROJECT OF ONE FIVE OR SIX SIX LAWSUITS. AND THAT THE COURTS ARE RESOLVED HAVE RESOLVED THE SCIENCE CONFLICT IN FAVOR OF GOODIES AND VALIDATED IT'S PUMPING PROPOSAL. UNFORTUNATELY I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT THAT IS SIMPLY NOT THE CASE SEQUEL AS YOU KNOW IS A PUBLIC DISCLOSURE STATUTE THAT REQUIRES PROJECT PROPONENTS AND THE COURTS. TO IDENTIFY ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS OF A PROPOSED PROJECT AND WAYS TO MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS. IN FACT IN REVIEWING THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE FOR AND AGAINST THE PROJECT SUCH AS THE PUMPING RATES HERE. AS THE COURT IN COULD DISS OWN CASE NOTED COURTS ARE NOT PERMITTED TO WEIGH AND RESOLVE CONFLICTS IN THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE PRESENTED. AND THIS IS ESSENTIALLY THE COURTS STATEMENT IN REVIEWING THE LEAD AGENCIES ACTIONS UNDER SEQUEL WE MAY NOT SET ASIDE. AND AGENCIES APPROVAL OF AN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT ON THE GROUND THAT AN OPPOSITE CONCLUSION WOULD HAVE BEEN EQUALLY OR MORE REASONABLE. IN CASE THERE'S ANY DOUBT AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE SINCE I'VE BEEN SAYING THE SAME THING SINCE I GOT INVOLVED. FROM WITH THIS BILL AT THE OUTSET I'M NOT TRYING TO PREVENT THE PUMPING OF WATER FROM THIS AQUIFER BYE KIDDIES OR ANY FUTURE LANDOWNER IN THE MOJAVE I'M FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE NEED. MORE WATER BUT I'M SIMPLY TRYING TO ENSURE THAT ANY PUMPING NOW OR IN THE FUTURE IS DONE IN AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE WAY AND AT AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE RATE. SO AS I SAID I THINK WE SHOULD HIT THE PAUSE BUTTON HERE AND HAVE AN INDEPENDENT TEAM OF SCIENTISTS REVIEW THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE. FOR AND AGAINST THE KIDDIES PROJECT AND RESOLVE THE CONFLICT AND THEN BASED ON THOSE WRITTEN FINDINGS WHICH THIS BILL REQUIRES. SENATE ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE ONE THAT INSURERS AN UNINTERRUPTED SUPPLY OF WATER TO ALL RESIDENTS WHILE PROTECTING A NATIONAL TREASURE IN THIS CASE THE MOJAVE. FROM POTENTIAL MANMADE DESTRUCTION THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. NOW WHY HASN'T KIDDIES MADE AN EFFORT TO RECONCILE THE SCIENCE EARLIER I HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO IDEA. NOW I'M GONNA ATTEMPT TO DEAL WITH SOME OF COULD DISS CLAIMS THAT I'M SURE YOU'VE HEARD I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD A LOT OF THEM. AND I'VE CERTAINLY READ ABOUT A LOT OF THEM IN THE HANDOUTS THAT ARE FLOATING AROUND THIS BUILDING. NOW THE BILL DEALS WITH ADVERSE EFFECTS ON NATURAL OR CULTURAL RESOURCES. COULD HE IS APPARENTLY CLAIMS THAT THE TERM ADVERSE EFFECTS AND THE ADVERSE EFFECTS STANDARD IS AMBIGUOUS. I WILL NOTE THAT THE STANDARD OF ADVERSE EFFECT ISSUES CONSISTENTLY THROUGHOUT SEQUEL AND THE FEDERAL EQUIVALENT WHICH IS DNIEPER. BAND IS REFERENCED EIGHTY TIMES EIGHT ZERO EIGHTY TIMES IN COULD DISS OWN GROUNDWATER MONITORING MITIGATION AND MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR THIS PROJECT. SO THE DEFINITIONS MUST BE FAIRLY CLEAR TO COULD THESE AND OTHERS SINCE COULD THESE PREPARE THE PLAN. KIDDIES EXPRESSES CONCERNS OVER THE USE OF THE TERM CULTURAL RESOURCES IN THIS BILL. APPARENTLY CLAIMING NOT TO KNOW WHAT THAT TERM MEANS. IN FACT THE TERM CULTURAL RESOURCES. IS ALSO USED TO RUN IN SEQUEL. AND IS DEFINED IN DETAIL IN COULD DISS OWN ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT. CHARACTERIZED ARE CATEGORIZED AS ARCHAEOLOGICAL RESOURCES HISTORIC RESOURCES CONTEMPORARY NATIVE AMERICAN RESOURCE IS AND PALEONTOLOGICAL RESOURCES THAT'S WHAT CULTURAL RESOURCES MEANS AND COULD THESE KNOWS THAT BECAUSE COULD THESE TO FIND IT. IN ITS OWN E. I. ARE. YOU MAY HAVE HEARD COULD THESE SAY THAT IF ONE ADDITIONAL MOLECULE OF ADVERSE IMPACT IS FOUND AS A RESULT OF THIS STUDY ONE ADDITIONAL MOLECULE. THAT THE AGENCIES CAN KILL THE PROJECT. IN FACT IN THE CASE OF COMMUNITIES FOR BETTER ENVIRONMENT AND CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION A CASE. INVOLVING SEQUEL GUIDELINES HE E. R. PREPARATION IN A DISCUSSION OF THRESHOLDS OF SIGNIFICANCE IN CUMULATIVE IMPACTS. THE COURT NOTED THE ONE ADDITIONAL MOLECULE RULE IS NOT. THE LAW IN CALIFORNIA. IN FACT IN ORDER TO BE DETERMINATIVE THE ADVERSE IMPACT MUST BE SIGNIFICANT SO ONE MOLECULE SIMPLY WON'T CUT IT. NOW I'VE TRIED TO ADDRESS THE SEQUEL ISSUE AND AND THE OTHER CLAIMS THAT THE BILL IS AIMED AT STOPPING. THE PROJECT'S IMPLEMENTATION. ALTOGETHER BUT THERE'S ONE FINAL. GOODIES CLAIM THAT DISTURBS ME THE MOST. AND THAT'S THE CLAIM THAT A TAX MY INTEGRITY. ASSERTING THAT DURING THIS PROCESS I HAVE FAILED TO UPHOLD THE COMMITMENTS I MADE TO THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE. THE COMMITMENTS THAT I MADE THE KIDDIES IN THE COMMITMENTS I MADE EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. NOW YOU KNOW I'VE I SERVE THIRTY TWO YEARS IN THE AIRFORCE. AND IN THE AIRFORCE OUR MISSION IT SENATE ROTH ONE MOMENT PLEASE. IT IS GETTING A LITTLE NOISY UP IN THE GALLERY I KNOW THERE ARE A LOT OF YOUNG ONES HERE THEY'VE BEEN HERE FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE DAY AND IT'S KIND OF HARD TO STAY QUIET. BUT I WOULD ASK THE PARENTS PLEASE TRY TO KEEP YOUR CHILDREN'S VOICES DOWN OR TAKE THEM OUTSIDE. WELL WE HAVE THIS IMPORTANT DEBATE AND DISCUSSION THANK YOU. THANK ABOUT A PRESENT I CAN CERTAINLY TALK OVER ANYONE. IN MY THIRD QUESTIONS HARD TO LISTEN -- FOR EVERYONE TO I WANT TO HEAR WHAT YOUR WORDS ARE SO PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU MA'AM. THIRTY TWO YEARS IN THE AIRFORCE OUR AIRFORCE CORE VALUES WERE AND CONTINUE TO BE INTEGRITY FIRST SERVICE BEFORE SELF AND EXCELLENCE IN ALL WE DO. I HAVE CERTAINLY TRIED TO FOLLOW THOSE CORE VALUES DURING MY AIRFORCE SERVICE. AND I'VE CERTAINLY TRIED TO DO SO SENSE AND I HOPE THAT YOU THINK I'VE SUCCEEDED. I ALSO HOPE YOU AGREE THAT. AT LEAST MY REPUTATION HERE IS THAT I SAY WHAT I MEAN AND DO WHAT I SAY. SO YOU CAN IMAGINE MY REACTION. AND MY EXTREME DISAPPOINTMENT. WHEN I LEARNED THAT MY INTEGRITY WAS BEING CHALLENGED DURING THIS PROCESS BY COULD COULD THESE CLAIMING THAT I DID NOT HONOR MY COMMITMENTS AND IN LEAST IN ONE CASE THAT I LIVE? I WANT TO TELL YOU AND I'M HERE TO TELL YOU THAT I HAVE TRIED TO WORK WITH KIDDIES THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS. I HAVE SAT THROUGH NUMEROUS MEETINGS BOTH HERE IN THE CAPITAL AND IN THE DISTRICT ATTEMPTING TO WORK OUT. COULD DISS CONCERNS. SO LONG AS WE GET THE RECONCILIATION OF THE SCIENCE I HAVE SAID FROM THE BEGINNING THAT THE ONLY THING THAT I'M INTERESTED IN WITH THIS BILL. IS TO HAVE A TOP DOWN REVIEW OF THE SCIENCE THE CONFLICTS IN THE SCIENCE AND A RECONCILIATION OF THE SCIENCE AND THE SETTING OF AN ENIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING. NO MORE NO LESS NOW DURING THESE VARIOUS MEETINGS AND WE WE STARTED WITH A VARIETY OF AMENDMENTS BEING EXCHANGED INCLUDING THE FIRST ONE WITH COULD THESE WHICH WANTED TO LIMIT THE REVIEW. TO THE SCIENCE IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AND SET THE TIME LINE FOR THAT REVIEW IT SIXTY DAYS. NOW YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THAT IF YOU'RE VIOLATING SCIENCE IN YOUR HIRING HIRING NEW SCIENCE IN TRYING TO RECONCILE SIXTY DAYS IS COMPLETELY UNREASONABLE OBVIOUSLY THAT AMENDMENT DIDN'T WORK. WE WENT BACK AND FORTH AND WENT BACK AND FORTH NOW COULD HE'S ONE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES ADDED TO THIS BILL SO WE ADDED THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES. COULD HE'S ONE OF THE PROCESS SO WE ADDED A PROCESS COULD HE'S ONE OF THE TIMELINE IN A TIME LIMIT PUT ON THE REVIEW WE DID SELL. FRANKLY I COULDN'T AGREE TO EVERYTHING KIDDIES WANTED BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT ELSE I COULD HAVE DONE A CURRENTLY WHAT I DID WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR KIDDIES. SO COLLEAGUES LONG GOING TO BE A LONG DAY I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE I WILL SAY THIS -- I HAVE NOT I DON'T THINK I'VE ASKED FOR YOUR HELP [inaudible] BUT ONE OR TWO TIMES IN THE SIX AND A HALF YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN ON THIS. FOR SO. AND I KNOW THIS IS A DIFFICULT BILL. SO FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO CAN. I WOULD ASK YOUR HELP AND I WOULD REQUEST NAY VOTE IN THIS CASE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR ROTH DEBATE OR DISCUSSION THE SENATOR GORGEOUS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. I WANT. TO FIRST START OFF WITH -- I DON'T HAVE THE INTIMATE KNOWLEDGE ON THIS ISSUE AS MY COLLEAGUE AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL DOES. BUT I CAN TELL YOU FROM WHAT I DO KNOW THIS AUTHOR -- HE IS AN OUTSTANDING INDIVIDUAL AND IF. INTEGRITY WAS EVER QUESTIONS THAT I WOULD QUESTION THOSE THAT MIGHT PUT FORWARD SUCH ALLEGATIONS SO. I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT THAT'S THAT'S PUT OUT THERE. BUT FROM MY STANDPOINT AS A MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWED THIS ISSUE [inaudible] THE SO I SAT ON THE POLICY COMMITTEE ON PARTICIPATING RIGHT IN ONE OF THE MOST DELIBERATE DISCUSSIONS OF THE POLICY QUESTIONS POSED BY THIS BILL -- BOTH SIDES PREVENTED GOOD CREDIBLE POLICY ARGUMENTS AS WE DELIVERY THIS BILL IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME. THAT THERE APPEARED TO BE A PATH FORWARD. A RECONCILIATION OF THE POSITIONS ESPECIALLY ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS I WAS VERY -- EXCITED ABOUT THAT. I REYES TO CONSIDER THE REVIEW SHOULD NOT TRY TO REDO THE SEQUEL PROCESS. I THINK THAT IS ONE OF THE AREAS OF ROB -- WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF HAVING A SEQUEL REVIEW PROCESS? IF THERE WILL BE TRAILER ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEWS ATTACHED AD NAUSEAM -- SO I BELIEVE AT LEAST FROM A LEGAL AND PROCEDURAL STANDPOINT. YOU CAN'T CONTINUE TO ADD ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND LEGAL PROCEDURES. BECAUSE THERE WAS NOT A DESIRED OUTCOME -- I THINK THAT IS KIND OF WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS THAT. INDIVIDUALS THAT WERE CHALLENGING THIS PROJECT WE'RE NOT FINDING THE DESIRED OUTCOME. THAT THEY WERE -- ACCRETING NEW PROCEDURAL AND REGULATORY OBSTACLES TO MAKE THIS THING HAPPEN. BUT AT ONE POINT IN THE HEARING I AGREE WITH OTHER MEMBERS THAT WE SHOULD NOT TRY TO RE WRITE THE BILL IN THE HEARING. AND THERE WAS A CLEAR PATH TO AMENDING THE BILL IN HAVE THE PROPER AGENCY CONDUCT THE REVIEW OF MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT -- WAS A WATER RESOURCES -- WAS ADDED -- I THINK THE IDEA THOUGH. WITHOUT AMENDMENTS AND I THINK. FOLKS WERE WERE APPRECIATIVE THAT WAS INCLUDED. BUT IT WENT BACK TO THE FACT THAT WE STILL DIDN'T WANT TO GO THROUGH OR THE ENTITIES DID NOT WANT TO GO THROUGH THIS PROCESS AGAIN SEE WHAT ONCE. DOES NOT MEAN SEE QUIRK INFINITY -- AND I THINK THAT'S WERE ADD. I IT I DON'T KNOW WHERE THE VOTES ARE ON THIS TODAY AND I KNOW IT'S A CONTENTIOUS ISSUE -- IN A PERFECT WORLD I'D LOVE TO SEE THIS CONVERSATION CONTINUE. I DON'T WISH THAT PROBABLY ON MY WORST ENEMY HOWEVER. SO -- SO SENATOR I I KNOW THAT YOU'VE -- PUT IN A GOOD AMOUNT A LEG WORK ON THIS AND I DON'T KNOW WE'RE THE MEETING OF THE MINDS CAN OCCUR. I'M JUST OF THE OPINION THAT I DON'T THINK WE'RE DONE. BUT IN ITS CURRENT FORM I HAVE TO HONOR SOME OF THE INITIAL REQUEST BECAUSE I THOUGHT THEY WERE REASONABLE. THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXTENSIVE AND FOR THOSE REASONS I WILL RESPECTFULLY OF VOTE AGAINST THE BILL IN SH. AND IF IT SHOULD IT PASS -- THEN I'M HOPING THAT THERE WILL BE A REITERATION IN THE SECOND HOUSE -- BUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK IN THIS PROCESS. SENATOR SKINNER. THANK YOU -- THAT A PRESIDENT MEMBERS I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND IF FOR ME IT IS NOT A DIFFICULT BILLER CONTROVERSIAL BECAUSE IT RECOGNIZES THAT. ONCE THE PLEADED ONCE WE REMOVE FOR GROUND WATER THEN THE AQUIFER. CAN [inaudible] RESTORE. IT IS PRETTY MUCH THE IRREVERSIBLE. AND I THINK FOR THOSE OF US WHO TRAVELED ELSEWHERE IN THE WORLD OR EVEN JUST TRAVELED IN THE SOUTHWEST STATES. WHEN YOU VISIT THE VARIOUS ARCHAEOLOGICAL SITES YOU SEE THAT THEY WERE THRIVING CIVILIZATIONS AND THEN THEY PUT THE EXPLANATION OF WHAT THE? WHAT THE? SCIENTISTS AND OTHERS ARE ANTHROPOLOGISTS AND SUCH YOU STARTED THE SITE. DETERMINE WHAT YOU KNOW WHY DO THESE PEOPLE LEAVE WHY DID THIS -- THRIVING COMMUNITY NO LONGER EXIST AND USUALLY THE EXPLANATION IS DEPLETION OF GROUNDWATER IS A WATER ISSUE. NOW CALIFORNIA DID NOT MEASURE OR MONITOR IT'S GROUND WATER FOR YEARS. WE DID NOT TAKE ACTION. TO EITHER MEASURE OR MONITOR OR LIMIT. THE DEPLETION OF GROUND WATER UNTIL. TWENTY FIFTEEN I WOULD ENCOURAGE ANY MEMBERS WHO ARE THINK THAT PERHAPS OR GROUND WATER. NOT ONLY IN THIS AREA OF MOJAVE MIGHT BE AT RISK BUT ACROSS THE STATE TO LOOK AT STANFORD. UNIVERSITY WEBSITE WHERE THEY SHOW A SERIES OF NASA PHOTOGRAPHS SATELLITE IMAGES USING INFRARED TECHNOLOGY. WHICH SHOW THE STATUS FOR GROUND WATER. ACROSS THE STATE. FIRST IN JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND TWO THEN JUNE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT AND THEN JUNE. TWENTY FOURTEEN IN JUNE TWENTY FOURTEEN PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THE AREAS THAT HAD BEEN GREEN GREEN SHOWING THAT THERE WAS. A AT LEAST SOME GOOD. RESERVE WHETHER IT WAS ADEQUATE OR NOT IS ANOTHER STORY. THAT ENTIRE MAP IS READ. NOW WE KNOW ALSO THAT THAT WAS AT THE HEIGHT OF OUR VERY LONG DROUGHT. BUT IN THE MOST RECENT INFRARED IMAGES IT ONCE AGAIN. SHOWS MOST OF THAT AREA AS READ AND WE'RE NOT JUST TALKING THE MOJAVE. SO. IT TO KNOW THAT AN AREA LIKE THE MOJAVE THAT IS ONE OF OUR MOST RESTRICTED AREAS IN TERMS OF RAINFALL AND RUN OFF SO THE LEAST ABLE. TO RESTORE ITS AQUIFER. THAT WE WOULD AT THIS TIME. NOT SUPPORT A BILL LIKE THIS THAT JUST ALLOWS OUR SCIENTISTS TO COME BACK TOGETHER. AND LOOKED AT WHAT IS THE REAL STATUS OF THE AQUIFER AND WHAT CAN IT REALLY BE SUSTAINED IN TERMS OF THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE PUMPED OUT OF IT. AND WITH THAT I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE [inaudible] SENATOR WIENER. I FIGURE OUT A PRESIDENT -- I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE OF SEVEN WHICH WILL PROTECT OUR DESERT'S FROM TENSELY UNSUSTAINABLE. PUMPING OF GROUNDWATER WITHOUT ADEQUATE ANALYSIS A REVIEW. I CALIFORNIAS DESERT SO SOME OF THE MOST ECOLOGICALLY DIVERSE IN THE WORLD. AND THE HARBOR A GREAT NUMBER OF ENDANGERED SPECIES RANGER RANGING FROM BURROWING AL'S TO AND DEMOCRATS FROM ROSES. I THESE REGIONS ARE ALSO HOME TO SOME OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND OUR STATE. FOR HOME A DRAMATIC SHIFT IN WATER TABLES COULD PROVE DISASTROUS. BY THIS LEGISLATION SIMPLY FORCES THE STATE TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK AT THE REAL IMPACTS OF THE PROPOSED GROUNDWATER EXTRACTION. AS THE LA TIMES IS WRITTEN ON THIS ISSUE QUOTE ONE POLITICS OUT FLYING SCIENCE IT DOESN'T HURT TO ADD A LITTLE MORE SCIENCE. I WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT AND VERY DIFFICULT ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT IDEA OF WANT TO THANK ALL OF YOU FOR TAKING SUCH A HIGH INTEREST IN MY DISTRICT -- I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THE DEBATE ON THE FLOOR MOJAVE DESERT THE KIDDIES PROJECT THE DISEASE ITSELF THE RESIDENTS THE MOJAVE. DESERT THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY THEY ALL BELONG TO THE SIXTEENTH SENATE DISTRICT. AND THE IT'S A PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME AND WE DO WHAT WE CAN KERN COUNTY HAS ALREADY APPROVED A SIGNAL PLAN WHICH WAS PASSED. WE BELIEVE THAT THE THE SCIENCE SHOWS THAT THE SPACE AND IS AN OPEN BASIN AND WILL BE RECHARGED. KIDDIES THE CLIENT IN THE CONSTITUENT IN MY DISTRICT THAT IS WHEN HE DOING THIS PROJECT. HAS THE DELAY IN THE PROJECT BEING PUMPED AND RESOURCE OUT NOW TO PROVIDE OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES. IN THE LOS ANGELES OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AREA WITH NECESSARY WATER IF IT'S NEEDED ESPECIALLY WHEN IF WE GO INTO WATER RATIONING AT FIFTY FIVE GALLONS A DAY. THIS COMPANY WHO IS DOING THIS -- THE REASON WHY IT'S TAKEN SO LONG IS BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN IN COURT FIGHTING LAWSUIT AFTER LAWSUIT AFTER LAWSUIT. TWELVE LAWSUIT. OVER A PERIOD OF YEARS THESE TWELVE LAWSUITS HAVE DELAYED THE EXTRACTION AND THEY HAVE BEEN TO OVER BACKWARDS THEY HAVE ONE EVERY TIME IN COURT. N. AS IT GOES IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU WIN IN COURT AND THE ADVERSARY IS NOT HAPPY WITH IT THEY BRING THE PRODUCT OR THE IDEA TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TO HOPEFULLY. OVERRULED WITH THE COURT SYSTEM HAS SAID. AGAIN COLLEAGUES THIS IS IN MY DISTRICT. THIS COMPANY HAS GONE ABOVE AND BEYOND SCIENCE SHOWS THAT IS AN OPEN BASIN THERE ARE PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT ON BOTH SIDES OF THIS ISSUE WE WANT TO RESET WE WANT TO PROTECT THE MOJAVE DESERT -- TO MAKE SURE IT IS STILL ONE OF THE MOST PRISTINE AREAS IN OUR DISTRICT THAT PEOPLE CAN GO TO BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE PROVIDE WATER TO THE CONSTITUENTS THIS TO THE SOUTH OF US. AND AGAIN THINK ABOUT THAT FOR JUST SICK MAN WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A BASE AN OVERDRAFT THE MOHAVE BASIN IS INCLUDED IN THE SIGMA PROJECT. AND TWELVE LAWSUITS IN OVER A DECADE LATER. THEY HAVE LOST EVERY SINGLE LAWSUIT AND THEY COME TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE LEGISLATURE TOO AGAIN IMPACT MY DISTRICT IN THIS PROJECT IS GONNA. A PROVIDE ABOUT SIX THOUSAND JOBS. WE TOOK -- WE TAKE A VOTE THE OTHER DAY ON THE FLOOR THAT ELIMINATES -- OUR CITIES FROM BRINGING IN FACTORIES WHERE WE HAVE. OR WAREHOUSES WHERE WE HAVE PLACES TO BE ABLE TO BUILD BECAUSE WE ON A LOT OF LAND -- BUT WE DON'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT THE COLD CALIFORNIA STATE A TAXPAYERS PAYING FOR A RE A MANUFACTURER'S CREDITOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT WERE APPLE PAYS WHAT POINT 0003% OF ANY TAX RATE. SO IT'S IN THE VALLEY THE VALLEY IS CONSTANTLY CHORE CHANGED AND THIS IS ANOTHER WAY THAT THIS LEGISLATURE'S COMING INTO MY DISTRICT IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. AND TRYING TO TAKE JOBS WHEN WE ARE DOING EVERYTHING WE CAN TO COMPLY WITH EVERY STATE LAW THAT COMES OUT OF THIS BUILDING. SO I WOULD ASK YOU TO NOT VOTE FOR THIS BILL SAVE THE SIX THOUSAND JOBS UP PULLED WITH THE COURT SAID AFTER TWELVE LAWSUITS. THAT HAVE BEEN FILED IN IT JUST CONTINUES AND NOW THEY'VE COME LIKE I SAID TO THE STATE LEGISLATURE TO GET YOU TO SUPERSEDE WHAT'S HAPPENING. SO I WOULD ASK FOR A NO VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR PORTANTINO. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT EYES RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB -- THREE OH SEVEN AND I ALSO RISE TO COMPLEMENT ITS AUTHOR FROM MY DISTRICT JUST EAST OF MINE -- I DON'T THINK THERE WAS A MORE THOUGHTFUL PERSON TO BE SHEPHERDING THIS THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE'S YOU KNOW THIS -- EFFORT IS HAD A TWO YEAR RUN LAST YEAR THERE WERE SOME PREACH PROCEDURAL ISSUES -- SURROUNDING IT IN THIS YEAR -- THE GOOD -- SENATOR HAS I THINK TRIED -- IN A HERCULEAN EFFORT TO GET ALL SIDES TO WORK TOGETHER -- HE IS SHOWN -- CLASS AND DIGNITY IN THAT PROCESS AND I'M PROUD. TO STAND WITH HIM IN SUPPORT SB THREE OH SEVEN AND HOPE THIS. CONTINUES TO MOVE IN CONTINUES THE CONVERSATION. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. AB MEMBERS I I RISE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE TODAY I WE HEARD IT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE I CHAIR THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCE IN WATER COMMITTEE AND I JUST WANT TO CORRECT A FEW -- RUMORS I GUESS FOR THE RECORD HERE -- WHEN IT COMES TO THE INTEGRITY OF THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE I THINK NONE OF US OUGHT HAVE ANY DOUBT BUT IF IT NEEDS CLARIFICATION? THE COMMITMENTS MADE BEFORE THAT COMMITTEE I BELIEVE HAVE BEEN FULFILLED. AND IF ANYTHING. THE DAYLIGHT WE SAW IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR COMPROMISE IN THAT COMMITTEE HEARING. CAME FROM THE KIDDIES PROJECT PROPONENTS THEMSELVES. I HEARD FROM THEM THAT THEY WERE OPEN TO A PRE PROJECTS SCIENTIFIC REVIEW. AND FROM MY UNDERSTANDING. THAT AMENDMENT IS NOT BEEN AGREED -- TO FOR THE PROJECT PROPONENTS THEMSELVES. IF THEY WERE WILLING AND OPEN TO HAVE THIS PROJECT LOOKED AT WITH AN OPEN INDEPENDENT SCIENTIFIC BODY HAS THIS BEEN PROPOSED. THE OFFER SITTING ON THE TABLE. SO THE CONCERN HERE IS THAT POLITICS IS BLED INTO THE POLICY. AND THIS IS JUST BECOME POSTURE BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ACTUAL SUBSTANCE OF THIS MEASURE. THERE ARE SOME EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RESOURCES ARE SO SPECIAL. THAT WE NEED TO THE TAKE A LOOK AT A SINGLE PROJECT. AND I DON'T LIKE SINGLE PROJECT BILLS WHETHER YOUR OPPOSED TO A PROJECT OR WITH THE SUPPORT OF PROJECT. BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROCESS. I THINK THERE'S A TON OF INTEGRITY TO THIS. I RESPECT WHAT THE SENATE FROM RIVERSIDE IS DONE. AND RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I'VE. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN SENATOR BATES. THANK YU ON MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS ARE I DO RISE COMES UP WITH CONCERNS ABOUT SB. THREE OH SEVEN AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY I REPRESENT THE SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT. BACK IN TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN IN -- TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE DISTRICT TOOK THE LEAD IN THE SECRET PROCESS THIS LEGISLATION JUST LIKE ITS PREDECESSORS WHICH IS AB ONE THOUSAND SP. ONE TWENTY SIX TO CREATE A NEW ADDITIONAL CERTIFICATION PROCESS AND YOU'VE ALL HEARD ABOUT FOR WATER CONVEYED IN CALIFORNIA'S WATER TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. OUR SANTA MARGARITA WATER DISTRICT ACTED PROPERLY IN THE CONDUCT OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT REPORT AS REQUIRED BY SEQUEL -- IN YOU OF HEARD THAT MANY MANY -- LAWSUITS WERE -- ENTERED IN ON THE COURT UPHELD THEIR REVIEW. THAT COULD THESE PROJECT HAS GONE THROUGH EXTENSIVE LITIGATION AND PREVAILED AT EVERY LEVEL. THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY APPEARS TO BE A TAX BILL EXAMPLE OF CHANGING THE RULES OF THE GAME. BEFORE -- BECAUSE BEFORE THE FACT BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE THE OUTCOME. OUR WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO ME PERSONALLY AND TO MY DISTRICT AND I THINK TO ARE. THE FUTURE OF WATER CAN DANCE IS THAT THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY AND I AM ASSUMING AND INTENTIONALLY CONSIDERING THE AUTHOR. KILLS THIS PROJECT AND SAYS THAT PRESIDENT GOING FORWARD FOR ANY OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WOULD HAVE TO DO WITH WATER CAN DANCE. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A SECOND LOOK ARE THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED PERHAPS WILL NOT BEEN. NECESSARILY A COMFORTABLE AND TO THE GOOD AUTHOR BOB THAT CERTAINLY DESERVES SOME CONSIDERATION SO WE DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT. THAT REALLY SHUTS DOWN A PROJECT THAT HAS I THINK THROUGH THAT WOULD BE OUR ALMOST EIGHT YEARS -- WALK THE WALK FOLLOW THE RULE BOOK AND NOW IN THE LAST. MILE IS HAVING SOMETHING THROWN AT THEM THAT COULD BASICALLY SHUT THE WHOLE THING DOWN I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING OF GREAT CONCERN ARE CERTAINLY TO MY DISTRICT TO THE KIDDIES PROJECT PROPONENTS. AND I ALSO THINK TO THIS LEGISLATURE ARE WE NEED TO FIND A SOLUTION AND THIS ONE OUT LACKS ARE CERTAINLY A FEW AMENDMENTS THAT COULD. MOVE IT ALONG IN AND CERTAINLY PROTECT THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED FROM THOSE WHO CURRENTLY OPPOSE. I ASKED -- FOR YOUR NOBLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SITTING IN HEARING NONE. SENATOR ROTH YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS FROM. BOTH SIDES PRO AND CON VERY THOUGHTFUL. A JUST NOT TO BELABOR IT BUT JUST TO REITERATE THERE'S NO REDO OF SEQUEL THERE NO DOCUMENT DUMPSTER NO PUBLIC HEARINGS THERE'S NO. CERTIFICATION PROCESS JUST OF SCIENTIFIC FINDING AS TO WHAT AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SUSTAINABLE PUMPING RATE IS. I WILL SAY THIS FORTUNATELY THE MOJAVE DESERT DOESN'T BELONG TO ANYONE OF US. AND DOESN'T BELONG TO ANY SINGLE SENATE DISTRICT. IT'S A NATIONAL MONUMENT. IN A STATE TREASURER. AND JUST LIKE TOM HOLE IN OUR CALIFORNIA COASTS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE DESERVES SOME SPECIAL ATTENTION SO WITH THAT.

SENATOR HILL THE FLOOR IS YOURS THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN A BILL THAT SEEKS TO REDUCE. MEDICAL DISPUTES AND INCREASED TRANSPARENCY IN THE OPERATION OF MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS WITHIN THE WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORKS OR EMPTY ENDS ARE A KEY TOOL IN OUR WORKERS COMPENSATION SYSTEM TO ENSURE THE INJURED WORKERS GET THE TREATMENT THEY NEED IN A COST EFFECTIVE WAY. M. P. AND ALSO ENSURE THAT WORKERS HAVE ENOUGH CHOICES TO ACCESS MEDICAL CARE WITH PROVIDERS THEY LIGHT HOWEVER MORE AND MORE STAKEHOLDERS HAVE STEPPED FORWARD WITH CONCERNS. ON HOW SOME IN PEONS ARE OPERATING IN THIS STATE. SPECIFICALLY THE CALIFORNIA PHYSICAL THERAPY ASSOCIATION HAS SHARED WITH US MULTIPLE DOCUMENTED INSTANCES OF PHYSICAL THERAPIST BEING PUSHED. TO TAKE EXTREMELY LOW REIMBURSEMENTS UNDER THE THREAT OF RECEIVING FEWER INJURED WORKER REFERRALS. SB FIVE THIRTY SEVEN ADDRESSES THIS RACE TO THE BOTTOM BY SETTING THE FEDERAL MEDICARE FEE SCHEDULE AS THE MINIMUM REIMBURSEMENT HALTING THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM. I'D ALSO LIKE TO ADD THAT SOME IN PEONS HAVE REACHED OUT. WITH SOME TECHNICAL CONCERNS ON HOW THE BILL IS CURRENTLY DRAFTED.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT THERE ARE VERY FEW WORKERS COMP BILLS THAT COME OFF THIS FLOOR THAT I WOULD STAND IN SUPPORT SO I PLUGGED THE AUTHOR. FOR MAKING THINGS A LITTLE BETTER FOR US IS EMPLOYERS BEING ABLE TO HAVE A MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK THAT OUR EMPLOYEES ARE COMFORTABLE WITH THAT PROVIDES GOOD ACCESS. TO CARE WHEN WE HAVE AN INJURED WORKER AND THIS MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE BECAUSE WE DO HAVE A LOT OF QUALITY -- INDIVIDUALS AND COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE ACCESS TO CARE AND THEY HAVE GOOD QUALITY CARE THAT WE DON'T HAVE HONOR IMPIAN NETWORK OR WILL NOT JOIN OR IN PM NETWORK BECAUSE THE FEE SCHEDULE IT'S NEGOTIATED SO LOW. SO I APPRECIATE THIS BILL AND I WOULD ENCOURAGE AN AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION FURTHER DEBATE SENATOR NIELSEN. VOTER PRESENTLY ASIAN JOURNAL THE SENATE I ALSO RISE IN SUPPORT AND I WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE AUTHOR. OVER THE DECADES THE WORKERS COMP BILLS OFTEN PROMISED AS MAJOR REFORMS. HAD FATAL FLAWS.

I THINK THAT THIS BILL IS. OF THE BEST WE CAN GET TODAY BUT IT DOES NOT AS I SEE. HAVE ANY OF THOSE ONEROUS PROVISIONS THAT MAKES THE SYSTEM. MORE LITIGIOUS. BUT RATHER IT HOLDS. THE COURSE OF THE REFORMS WE'VE HELD IN THE PAST. AND WILL BE. A PLUS. NOT A MINUS IRISH IN MY BOOK. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR BORDERS.

THREE SENATE BILL FIVE FORTY TWO BY SENATOR STERN AND ACTUALLY TO WORKERS COMPENSATION. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. WE HAVE A MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA NO WHERE IS THAT CRISIS MORE PRONOUNCED THAN AMONG OUR FIRST RESPONDERS. THE LOSS OF LIFE DUE TO SUICIDE THIS PAST YEAR. OUTPACED THE LOSS OF LIFE ON THE FRONT LINES FIGHTING FIRES MAKING RESCUES IN THE LINE OF DUTY. THIS IS A TROUBLING TREND THAT NEEDS TO BE STOPPED. PART OF THIS ABOUT POLICY IN PART OF ITS BY CHANGING THE STIGMA AROUND MENTAL HEALTH. NEARLY ONE IN FOUR POLICE OFFICERS AND ONE IN SIX FIREFIGHTERS HAVE CONSIDERED SUICIDE. AND 20% OF FIRE SERVICE MEMBERS IN 32% OF LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. HAVE SUFFERED FROM PT POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURIES AT ONE POINT. COMPARED TO AN ESTIMATED 328% OF ALL ADULTS. THESE ARE HARD JOBS. AND A MENTAL HEALTH INJURY A POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY IS AN INJURY JUST LIKE ANY OTHER INJURY. BIKE A DISLOCATED SHOULDER OR BROKEN RISK. BUT THESE HIDE IN THE SHADOWS. AND TODAY. WITH THIS VOTE WE HOPE. WE CAN TELL. OUR FIRST RESPONDERS THAT WE BELIEVE YOU. THAT WE ARE ON YOUR SIDE. AND THAT WHEN YOU GET ARE BACK YOU KNOW WE WILL HAVE YOURS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THOUGHTS AND PRAYERS. THIS BAT PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. SO WE'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD IN THIS LEGISLATION WE KNOW THERE'S SOME CONCERNS AND CONCERNS IT'S STILL OUTSTANDING. IN TERMS OF HOW THE MECHANICS OF THIS WILL WORK AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT. I AM VERY OPEN IN THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND LOOK FOR TO RESOLVING SOME OF THOSE ISSUES -- BUT WE THINK ON THE WHOLE THIS BILL IS A SOLID FRAMEWORK AN IMPORTANT STEP. I RESPECTFULLY ASK DR THANK YOU SENATOR STERN COLLEAGUES IN THE BACK. LET'S PLEASE KEEP THE NOISE DOWN IF WE COULD AND IN THE GALLERY AGAIN. I KNOW THERE'S SOME LITTLE ONES HERE LET'S PLEASE TRY TO MANAGE THEM OR GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOU TO LEAVE. THE BETTER DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SENATOR NIELSEN. BUT A PRESERVATION DONE THE SENATE I DON'T OFTEN SUPPORT SUCH BILLS. BUT I FIND MERIT. IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AND PART OF MY AYE VOTE IS TO BE IN A POSITION TO CONTINUE. THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENT WHICH I'M VERY SENSITIVE. TO AND WHICH HAS BEEN A MAJOR REASON FOR MY OBJECTION. IN YEARS PAST. BUT I MUST CONFESS IS THIS IS ONE THAT KIND OF PULLS AT THE HEARTSTRINGS. KNOWING AS INTIMATELY AS I DO. ARMORED -- MERGES THE PERSONNEL. OF POLICE OFFICERS. THE DEPUTY SHERIFF'S. WHO WALKED DEBATE? IN A FIRE FIGHTERS. ALL OVER THE STATE. ALL OF WHO PUT THEIR LIVES AT RISK. IN A TELLING A MOMENT OCCURRED IN MY OFFICE JUST A VERY FEW YEARS AGO. I HAD SOME POLICE OFFICERS. WIRES. THE MY OFFICE. TALKING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF THEIR JOB AND HOW THE TIDE TURNED AGAINST THEM [inaudible] THEIR HUSBANDS. FOR THE FACT FOR THE AND THEY WERE NOW. MORE AT RISK. THAN EVER BEFORE. AND ONE WOMAN THOUGH LOOKED AT ME AND SHE SAID THAT WHAT ABOUT ME [inaudible] SENATOR. MY HUSBAND'S NAME CANNOT GO UPON THAT MEMORIAL WALL [inaudible] BECAUSE HE COMMITTED SUICIDE. I BRING THAT TO YOUR ATTENTION BECAUSE I'M NOT UNFAMILIAR THOUGH I'VE NEVER BEEN A SWORN. OFFICER I HAVE WALKED THE BEAT. AND I KNOW. THE STRESS THAT IT ENTAILS. AND I KNOW THE DIFFICULTIES. FOR I'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH A VERY VERY PERSONALLY. OF COURSE NOT TAKING IT HOME. THAT WHICH YOU SAW DURING THE COURSE OF YOUR WORK THAT DAY. TO NOT TAKE IT HOME [inaudible] THESE INDIVIDUALS. DESERVE THAT CONSIDERATION. TO MAKE THEIR LIVES THE LIVES OF THEIR FAMILIES. A LITTLE BIT EASIER HIGHER CHEN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU CENTER NIELSEN. SENATOR GROW. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- I WOULD LIKE YOU GUYS ALL I GET THAT IT THIS IS A TUG ON THE HEARTSTRINGS BUT I WANT YOU GUYS TO ALL LOOK AT THE LEGISLATION AND LOOK AT POLICY THAT'S ALREADY IN PLACE. AND THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT IT A CUMULATIVE TRAUMA FROM FIREFIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS. IS A HUGE ISSUE BUT THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH STRICTLY A STRICT PRESUMPTION. PRESUMING THAT ANY CLAIM BROUGHT TO GIVES THE COUNTY IS PRESUMED AUTOMATICALLY TO BE. A POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME CLAIM OR PRESUME TO TO BE A CLAIM. WHAT IS IN PLACE NOW IS THE FIRST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS? SO MEANING THAT IF SOME LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER FIREFIGHTER ANY WORKER FOR ANY MATTER. FILES A CLAIM WITH THE EMPLOYER THE FIRST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IMMEDIATELY STARTS EVEN IF THE COMPLAINT THE CLAIM IS IN DISPUTE. SO THE FIREFIGHTER THE POLICE OFFICER ANYONE ELSE CAN GO TO THE DOCTOR SEE A PSYCHOLOGIST AND THEN. THEY CAN THEY CAN DETERMINE THAT IT IS A WORK RELATED INJURY IN THE FIRST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IS COVERED. BY THE EMPLOYER OR THE COUNTY. THAT IS A PROPER DETERMINATION WHERE YOUR DOCTOR THAT YOU PICK OR THE PSYCHOLOGIST THAT YOU PICK OR THE PERSON YOU DECIDE FOR TREATMENT HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO EVALUATE YOU. TO SAY YES THIS IS A WORK RELATED ISSUE YES THIS DID HAPPEN OVER TIME YES YOU ARE AFFECTED BY THIS AND THAT IS THE FIRST TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AVAILABLE. PASSING THIS BILL SIR CONVINCED THAT PROCESS AND AUTOMATICALLY PRESUMES NO MATTER WHAT. THEY DID IS A CUMULATIVE TRAUMA WORK RELATED POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS SYNDROME -- ISSUE I JUST ASK THAT YOU LET THE LAW THAT IS IN PLACE NOW WITH THIS TEN THOUSAND DOLLAR AUTOMATIC GUARANTEE. PAYMENT OF BENEFITS THAT STARTS IMMEDIATELY UNDISPUTED WHEN THE CLAIM IS FILED. THAT THEY GET TO USE THAT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS GO SEE THE DOCTOR THEY CHOOSE TO SEE WITHIN THE MEDICAL PROVIDER NETWORK AND MAKE SURE. THAT IT TRULY IS A CLAIM AND PROTECT OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM STEPH IS NOT NAM AS SEEN LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIREFIGHTERS WILL FALL FILE FALSE CLAIMS. THAT'S I DON'T I THINK THAT'S ALMOST UNHEARD OF I JUST WOULD ASK YOU TO ALLOW THE LAW THAT IS IN PLACE CONTINUE TO WORK. AND NOT CREATE A PRESUMPTION THAT MAKES IT AUTOMATICALLY PAYABLE BY TE COUNTY I THINK IT AFFECTS OUR COUNTIES AND LOCAL JURISDICTIONS -- AND I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT THERE REALLY IS A MECHANISM ON THE BOOKS TO ALLOW THEM TO HAVE TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS IN IMMEDIATE MEDICAL CARE -- OR PSYCHIATRIC CARE -- AND THEY CAN GO TO THEIR DOCTOR TO GET THAT AND THAT DR CAN MAKING EVALUATION AND DETERMINE TO BE COMPENSATED BOWL AND THEN THE EMPLOYER IS AUTOMATICALLY REQUIRED TO MAKE SURE IT'S COMPENSATED BOWL SO I WOULD APPRECIATE A NO VOTE ON A PRESUMPTION. THANK YOU SENATOR GROVER ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM. SEEING AND HEARING NONE. SENATOR STERN YOU MAY CLOSE. THEY MAY PRESENT AND THANK YOU MEMBERS [inaudible] FOR THE DISCUSSION. I I DO WANT TO MAKE ONE POINT OF CLARIFICATION. THIS BILL WOULD PUT IN PLACE A REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION ABOUT THE POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY SO -- IF THERE IS CONCERN ABOUT -- WHETHER THIS PRESUMPTION WOULD BEING. CONCLUSIVE AND JUST SOLELY BASED ON SAY AN ATTESTATION FROM A FIRST RESPONDER THAT'S NOT THE CASE. THE PREMISE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS THAT. TO PUT THE BURDEN ON A FIRST RESPONDER. TO INITIALLY HAVE TO GO BACK AND BEAR THAT BURDEN TO PROVE THAT IF THEY'RE HAVING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS. OR IF THEY'RE HAVING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES IN THEIR LIVES TO SAY. YOU KNOW WE DON'T BELIEVE YOU THE BURDEN IS ON YOU TO PROVE TO US THAT YOU ACTUALLY HAD THAT INJURY. THEN YOU NEED TO GO BACK AND SHOW EVERY LITTLE PIECE OF DOCUMENTATION BEFORE WE CAN EVEN GET THAT CLAIM GOING. THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE THE WRONG BALANCE AND WE ALREADY HAVE THIS REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION FOR HEART DISEASE TUBERCULOSIS OTHER COMMON CANCERS ACTUALLY THAT ARISE FROM FIREFIGHTERS ARE EXPOSED. TO PARTICULAR CHEMICALS SO WE HAVE THIS KIND OF REBUTTABLE PRESUMPTION ON OUR BOOKS ALREADY -- BUT WE THINK IT OF ITS APPROPRIATE HERE IN THE POST TRAUMATIC STRESS INJURY CONTEXT I DO WANT TO SAY THOUGH THAT. THIS BILL WILL ADD SOME COST THE SYSTEM -- WE HOPE THAT IT WILL. WE HOPE THAT PEOPLE USE THESE SERVICES TO ACTUALLY GET THEMSELVES OUT OF THEIR INJURED STATE -- BUT THE COSTS SHOULD BE EXCESSIVELY MANAGEABLE -- COMPARED TO THE BURDENS THAT THESE FIRST RESPONDERS ALREADY THERE. AND WE THINK IT'S A FAIR FRAMEWORK THAT IS FRAUD PROOF AND YEAH. I I HAVE TROUBLE WITH -- THAT PRESUMPTION THAT OUR FIRST RESPONDERS MIGHT BE. DECEIVING US WHEN THEY SAY THEY HAVE A PROBLEM I THINK THE PROBLEM IS JUST THE OPPOSITE. AND I THINK WE NEED TO GET PAST THAT STIGMA INTO A PLACE WHERE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE PERFECT EVERY DAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO PROFESS. TOTAL TOUGHNESS IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU HAVE BEEN INJURED TODAY IS THE START TO ENDING THAT STIGMA.

SAID ABOUT FIVE SEVENTY FIVE A SENATOR BRADFORD AN ACT RELATING TO CAL GRANTS SENATOR BRADFORD. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. NELSON MANDELA OFTEN STATED THE MOST. POWERFUL TOOL IN CHANGING THE WORLD IS IT EDUCATION. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN IT'S ALSO THE MOST POWERFUL TOOL TO CHANGE ALIVE. THAT'S WHY I'M HERE PRESENTING SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE TO PROVIDE THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CURRENTLY INCARCERATED OPPORTUNITY TO NOT ONLY CHANGE YOUR LIFE WOULD CHANGE THE WORLD AS WELL. INCARCERATIONS SHOULD NOT BE AUTOMATIC DISQUALIFICATION FOR STUDENTS FROM THE CAL GRANT PROGRAM. SB FIVE SEVENTY FIVE REMOVES OUTDATED BARRIERS AND EXPAND ACCESS TO POST SECONDARY EDUCATION OPPORTUNITIES FOR INCARCERATED STUDENTS. THROUGH THE SECOND CHANCE CAL GRANTS WHILE SUPPORTING AFFECT THE REBEL REBEL TATE OF EFFORTS WITH IN OUR CORRECTIONAL INSTITUTION AGAIN OF REHABILITATION IS TO BE REAL EDUCATION HOUSE TO BE PART OF IT. MEMBERS PROVIDING FINANCIAL AID TO INCARCERATED STUDENT IT'S NOT NOTHING NEW HERE IN CALIFORNIA NOR IN THIS COUNTRY. HIGHER ED THE HIGHER EDUCATION ACT OF NINETEEN SIXTY FIVE AUTHORIZED THOSE WHO WERE INCARCERATED TO BE ELIGIBLE. TO RECEIVE A PELL GRANT. BUT UNFORTUNATELY DOING ARE TOUGH ON CRIME. WE ENDED THE PROGRAM. IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN PRESIDENT OBAMA ANNOUNCES SECOND CHANCE PELL GRANT PLY PILOT PROGRAM TO ALLOW THOSE INCARCERATED TO RECEIVE. PELL GRANTS TO BRIDGE PURSUE POST SECONDARY EDUCATION. IMPROVING THAT EDUCATION IS A NON PARTISAN. ISSUE. THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION EXTENDED TO A A BOMB ERA PILOT PROGRAM FOR THE FOURTH TIME THIS YEAR. SO WHY IS CALIFORNIA NOT DOING THE SAME THING WHEN THE BENEFITS ARE CLEAR. STUDENTS TO RECEIVE WHO TO STUDENTS WHO ARE INCARCERATED TO PARTICIPATE. AND CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION HOW WILL 43% LOWER RECIDIVISM RATE. EVERY DOLLAR INVESTED IN CORRECTIONAL EDUCATION RESEARCHERS FOUND. RETURNS FOUR TO FIVE DOLLARS BACK TO SOCIETY CALIFORNIA CURRENTLY SPANS OVER EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR TO HOUSING INMATE. YET FULL TIME EDUCATION FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS COSTS A LITTLE MORE THAN FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHAT EDUCATION ALONE DOES NOT SOLVE OUR ISSUES AS IT RELATES SIR. INCARCERATION IN RECIDIVISM IT IS IMPORTANT COMPONENT WHICH IS WHY YOU WILL SEE A VARIETY OF EDUCATIONAL IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE ORGANIZATIONS IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. THE ABILITY TO HAVE A SECOND CHANCE IS FUNDAMENTAL NOT ONLY TO OUR STATE. BUT TO OUR NATION THIS IS JUST A FAIR PASS AND I I MEAN IN STATING THE SECOND CHANCE CAL GRANT AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR BORCHERS. THE MAN PRESIDENT -- THIS IS THE EARLY THE DAY OF CAL GRANTS -- BUT I WANTED -- TO COMMAND THE AUTHOR. OF FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD -- I DON'T HAVE DATA I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE -- THAT MIGHT JUSTIFY. BUT IT JUST TAKES COMMONSENSE THE THING THAT. YOU GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY WHILE THEY'RE INCARCERATED -- TO BUILD UP SOME SKILLS TO BECOME EDUCATED THAT THE RATE OF RECIDIVISM HAS TO DRAW I CAN'T IMAGINE A SCENARIO WHERE THAT'S NOT THE CASE.

THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- AND SENATORS SB SIX HUNDRED WILL MAKE CLEAR WITHOUT A DOUBT THAT THE STANDARD FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES. WHEN A MEDICALLY NECESSARY TREATMENT MAY DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY BECAUSE -- INFERTILITY ARE COVERED ARE A COVERED BENEFIT BECAUSE THE LAW DOES NOT EXPLICITLY SPELL OUT EACH AND EVERY COVERED SERVICE THERE IS CONFUSION ABOUT WHAT FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS. MANY PATIENTS HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY DENIED COVERAGE DESPITE THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGED HEALTHCARE REPEATEDLY AND CONSISTENTLY OVERTURNING HEALTH PLAN DENIALS OF COVERAGE. FOR FERTILITY PRESERVATION THESE WRONGFUL DELAYS AND THE NILES CONTINUE TO REGULARLY OCCUR AND MULTIPLE HEALTH PLANS HAVE BLATANTLY DEFIED. THE MH SHE'S ORDER TO PAY SPECIFIC CLAIMS COVERAGE WITH PROP APPROVALS FOR CARE IS CRITICAL FOR ACCESS. THE REBEL RELATIVELY HIGH OUT OF POCKET COSTS COUPLED WITH A SHORT WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR UNDERGOING THESE PROCEDURES BETWEEN DIAGNOSIS AND COMMENCEMENT OF TREATMENT. MAKE THEM ON AFFORDABLE FOR MANY PATIENTS WITHOUT INSURANCE OR HEALTH PLAN COVERAGE. FOR SOME PATIENTS THIS POTENTIAL LOSS OF PARENTHOOD IS VERY PROFOUND CAUSING DEPRESSION LOWER QUALITY OF LIFE AND A SOME STUDIES HAVE SHOWN HE EVEN THE WILLING TO STOP FOR LESS EFFECTIVE TREATMENT. OR FAILURE TO ADHERE TO TREATMENT TO TRY TO MINIMUM THE MINIMIZE THE LOSS OF FERTILITY SB SIX HUNDRED IS NECESSARY TO ENSURE THAT PATIENTS CAN OBTAIN FERTILITY PRESERVATION IMMEDIATELY. ENABLING THEM TO FOCUS ON THEIR TREATMENT AN UNDERLYING DISEASE CONDITION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THE SIDE OF DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SEEING AND HEARING NONE. I'M SORRY SENATOR BOARD JUST. MADAM PRESIDENT MAY I POSE A QUESTION TO THE ALL TO ACCEPT THE QUESTION I WANT WITHOUT OBJECTION YOU MAY PROCEED. MAYBE YOU CAN -- OFFER CLARIFICATION ON THIS -- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS CLARIFIES THAT AN INDIVIDUAL OR GROUP HEALTH CARE SERVICE PLAN -- CONTRACTOR HEALTH INSURANCE POLICY THAT COVERS HOSPITAL MEDICAL OR SURGICAL EXPENSES INCLUDE COVERAGE FOR STANDARD FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES. THE STANDARD FERTILITY PRESERVATION SERVICES CAN YOU GIVE ME A QUICK. UNDERSTANDING THAT'S NOT FERTILITY SERVICES ITS FERTILITY PRESERVATION IS THAT. SO IT'S HARVESTING OF EGGS AND SPERM PRIMARILY. TO PRESERVE SOMEONE'S OPTION FOR FERTILITY WHEN THE MANDATES ORIGINALLY CREATED WHEN. CHEMOTHERAPY TREATMENTS WORK. YOU KNOW BECAME THE STANDARD OF CARE THEY WERE ABOUT THIRTY EIGHT COVERED CONSEQUENCES OF CHEMO -- FERTILITY PRESERVATION WAS NOT -- ONE NOW IT WOULD BE COVERED -- I KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS THAT'S COME UP WITH. THE CREATION OF EMBRYOS -- BUT AS THE STANDARD OF FERTILITY PRESERVATION HAS GOTTEN. BETTER AND MORE EFFICIENT -- EGGS ARE JUST AS EFFECTIVE IN SO THAT'S TYPICALLY THE PRIMARY USE FOR PRIMARY CHOSEN FERTILITY PRESERVATION METHOD FOR WOMEN OBVIOUSLY FOR MAN IT'S IT'S DIFFERENT -- SO THAT'S THE STATS THE COVERAGE SO PRESERVING AG'S PRESERVING SPERM ALLOWING THAT PERSON TO GET. CURED. AND THEN CAN HAVE A FAMILY AFTER THEIR CURED OF THEIR CANCER OR OTHER ELEMENT TO FOLLOW QUESTION -- IS -- PURITY TIME THAT I'M SORRY SENATOR WE ACCEPT THE FOLLOWING QUESTION ALL EXCEPT TO FOLLOW THANK. SO IS THERE A PERIOD OF TIME THAT -- THE COVERAGE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE PRESERVATION OF THOSE EGGS IS IT ONLY DURING. THE CANCER TREATMENT OR THE THE TREATMENT. OR IN PERPETUITY IS IT SIGNED ITS PRIOR TO TREATMENT. BUT AFTER BUT AFTER THE TREATMENT IT IS THEN BECOME THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE OF THE INSURANCE CARRIER OR THE INDIVIDUAL TO MAINTAIN THOSE EGGS. IN A FROZEN STATE I THINK THERE ONCE THEY'RE HARVARD AND THEIR FROZEN I I ACTUALLY HAVE. TO TO BE HONEST WITH YOU DON'T KNOW LONG DON'T KNOW THE LONGEVITY OF THAT COMMITMENT BUT TYPICALLY WHOEVER HARBORS SCHISM. THE HAS A CONTRACT WITH THE CRYOGENIC LABORATORY TO FREEZE THEM AND STORE THEM AS PART OF THAT TREATMENT SO I THINK IT'S A BUILT IN COST. FOR A FULL SERVICE FERTILITY PRESERVATION. THAT I THINK WOULD BE IMPORTANT TO FIND OUT -- THIS HITS HOME FOR ME ON A VERY PERSONAL LEVEL -- FOR A COUPLE YEARS MY WIFE WENT THROUGH -- SHE WENT THROUGH A LOT OF TREATMENT [inaudible] AND THIS ISSUE CAME UP. AND IT ADDED INSULT TO THAT INJURY. AND I THINK I I HAVE SOME ISSUES ON A POLICY LEVEL I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY. WHERE? EVERYTHING PLAYS OUT WITH THIS LEGISLATION. BUT I THINK THE ABILITY TO PRESERVE A WOMAN'S RIGHT -- OF OF COUPLES RIGHT TO HAVE CHILDREN. IS SO TANTAMOUNT AND FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR HUMAN CONDITION CONDITION EXPERIENCE. THIS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED A COMPONENT OF THAT SERVICE. THANK YOU SENATOR STONE. THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT AND COLLEAGUES AND I WANT TO THANK. THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING US THREE SIX HUNDRED FORWARD AND I ALSO WANT. TO COMMEND MY MY FRESHMAN SENATOR -- FOR ASKING A LOT OF REALLY GOOD QUESTIONS TODAY AND THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING WE HAVE ISSUES WITH BILLS THAT ARE COMING FORWARD SO I JUST WANNA THROW LITTLE SHOT OUT TO YOU. BUT I WOULD SAY WITHOUT THAT ONE OF THE WORST DIAGNOSES AT A A MAN OR A YOUNG MAN WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IS THAT THEY HAVE TO STICK A CANCER OR A WOMAN HAVING CERVICAL CANCER OVARIAN CANCER. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT ALLOWS SOMEONE THAT GETS THIS DIAGNOSIS AND HAS TO GET WHAT'S CALLED AN ORCHIECTOMY DOCTOR CAN THOSE WITH THAT IS AS WHEN YOU HAVE. THE MALE GENITALS -- BASICALLY -- REMOVE THE **** REMOVED OR IF YOU HAVE SOMEONE WHO HAS TO HAVE A HYSTERECTOMY. OR HAS TO UNDERGO SOME CHEMOTHERAPY THAT CAN CAUSE SOME LONG TERM DAMAGE TO THESE ORGANS. PRIOR TO INITIATING THE THIRD THE SURGERY OR THE CHEMOTHERAPY. ONE CAN PRESERVE THEIR SPERM OR THEIR AEGS. SO THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO BE A PARENT. IN THE FUTURE. THE CHALLENGE WITH THIS WAY OF PRESERVING THE SPERM ARE THE AGES IT IS VERY EXPENSIVE AND WE CAN UNDERSTAND WHY THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WOULDN'T WANT. TO PAY FOR THE SERVICE IN A CERTAINLY OUT OF THE ROOM -- FOR MANY YOUNG COUPLES OR MIDDLE AGE COUPLES FOR THAT MATTER TO PAY FOR THE SERVICES. IT'S A VERY NARROW WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY IF YOU WILL TO ALLOW SOMEONE TO HAVE THE JOYS. AND THE PLEASURE. OF BEING A PARENT OF A CHILD. THIS LEGISLATION WILL ALLOW THOSE COUPLES THAT HAVE ALREADY HAVE THE ODDS STACKED AGAINST THEM IN LIFE WITH THESE. HORRIBLE DIAGNOSES. TO HOPEFULLY. RECOVER FROM THESE DIAGNOSES. BUT ENJOY. THE LOVE AND A PLEASURE OF BEING A PARENT ONE DAY FOR THOSE REASONS WE SHOULD STAND UP AND SUPPORT SB. SIX HUNDRED THANK YOU CENTER STONE ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SIR PORTANTINO SOUNDS LIKE A LOVE FEST YOU MAKE FUNDS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE WHAT ONE COMMENT IN RESPONSE -- HAVING. THIS ABILITY. ALLOWS PATIENTS TO PRESERVE THEIR PRESENT OF FERTILITY AND GET CURED QUICKER THERE'S ACTUALLY ECONOMIC MODELS TO SHOW THAT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL SAVE MONEY. BECAUSE WHEN PATIENTS DELAY TREATMENT OR TRY TO HAVE A BABY IN THE NEXT NINE MONTHS THEY GET SICKER AND HAVE MORE CUTE -- INSTANCES OF HEALTH CARE NEEDS AND IT ACTUALLY COSTS INSURANCE COMPANY MORE AND THE ADVANCES IN FERTILITY PRESERVATION ARE OUT OF THE STRATOSPHERE BETTER THAN THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS AGO WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE.

THE 6% OF FOLKS IN THE U. S. ARE ALLERGIC TO LATEX INCLUDING UP SERVICE WORKERS AN 11% OF THE ELDERLY. WHY IS IT SO MUCH HIGHER AMOUNTS FOOD SERVICE WORKERS WELL IT'S BECAUSE? THERE ARE ALSO REALLY EXPOSED A LOT MORE TO TO LAY TAX I WHICH AND IT'S BECOMING -- RESULTING IN MANY CASES IT WITH A LIFE THREATENING ALLERGY. AND SO FOR THOSE WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM THIS ALLERGY EVEN TRACE AMOUNTS OF NATURAL RUBBER LATEX CAN BE DEADLY. NOW RECOGNIZING THE GROWING THREAT OF LATEX EXPOSURE THE CDC AND THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH RECOMMEND WORKERS QUOTE. USE OF NON LATEX GLOVES FOR ACTIVITIES THAT ARE NOT LIKELY TO INVOLVE CONTACT WITH INFECTIOUS MATERIALS. SUCH AS FOOD PREPARATION ROUTINE HOUSEKEEPING GENTLEMEN IS ETCETERA. AND MANY RESIDENTS OF ALREADY GONE LATEX FREE AS MANY HEALTH CARE AND DENTAL FACILITIES THAT ONE PROTECT OUR STAFF. ALTERNATIVE SUCH AS NITRILE GLOVES OFFER THE SAME AND FOR BETTER PROTECTION AND HERE'S THE THING THERE ARE. MOST OFTEN CHEAPER. SO -- THIS -- PHASES OUT THE USE OF LATEX IN. RESTAURANTS WE'VE HAD LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH FOLKS IN THE RESTAURANT INDUSTRY AND AND THEY ARE NOT IN OPPOSITION.

WHAT MAKE SURE EVERYBODY'S AWAKEN LISTENING I KNOW THAT WE ALL REMAIN FULLY COMMITTED TO MAKING THE PROMPT TESTING OF RAPE KIDS A REALITY WHICH IS WHY I AM BEFORE YOU TODAY WITH THIS RE INTRODUCTION? THE CORE OF SB TWENTY TWO IS ACTUALLY VERY SIMPLE BUT IT WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT ON THE LIVES OF SURVIVORS AND HELP PUT RAPISTS BEHIND BARS. THIS MAJOR SIMPLY CHANGES ONE WORD IN EXISTING LAW BY SAYING THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES AND FORENSIC LABORATORIES SHALL FOLLOW INSTEAD OF SHOULD FOLLOW AS IT CURRENTLY STATES LISTED TIME FRAMES FOR SUBMITTING AND ANALYZING RAPE KIT EVIDENCE. MEMBERS MANY OF YOU KNOW THAT JUST THREE YEARS AGO MY SB EIGHT THIRTEEN WHICH ELIMINATED THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ON RATE WAS SIGNED INTO AW. THOUGH THAT WAS CERTAINLY A HUGE VICTORY THE ROAD TO JUSTICE FOR SURVIVORS OF RAPE AND SEXUAL ASSAULT WILL BE INCOMPLETE IF THE RAPE KITS ARE NEVER TESTED. AND THEY JUST SAID IN A WAREHOUSE OR EVIDENCE LOCKER SOMEWHERE COLLECTING DUST ALL RAPE SURVIVORS TO SPOT DESERVE TO HAVE THE RATE KIDS TESTED PROMPTLY. WHICH CAN IN TURN HELP TO ENSURE JUSTICE IDENTIFIES SERIAL PERPETRATORS AND EVEN EXONERATE THE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED MEMBERS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR STONE THANK YOU BETTER PRESIDENT I PROBABLY STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB TWENTY TWO AND I'M HONORED TO BE A CO AUTHOR WITH -- THAT THE GREAT SENATOR FROM CHINO HILLS AND I APPRECIATE HER STEADFAST.

TO GET THROUGH IN THE GOD THIS WEEK AND NEXT AND I WOULD IMAGINE THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO BE VERY STRONGLY SUPPORTED. BUT I JUST WANTED TO STE THE END UP AND SPEAK TO IT BECAUSE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM TO MACULA POINTED OUT [inaudible] THE IF A PERSON WHO WAS SEXUALLY ASSAULTED. GOES TO THE TROUBLE OF REPORTING IT THAT'S THE FIRST THING% BECAUSE IT'S NUMBER. ONE VERY FEW. SEXUAL ASSAULTS OR EVEN REPORTED. AND THEN THEY ARE WILLING TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THE MAN MEDICAL EXAMINATION AND WE'RE NOT TALKING A SIMPLE MEDICAL EXAMINATION THIS IS AN EXAMINATION THAT TAKES HOURS. AND IS VERY INVASIVE SO THEN THAT PERSON SUBJECT THEMSELVES TO THAT. AND THEN THAT EVIDENCE WHICH IS THEN PUT INTO SOMETHING WE CALL A RAPE KIT WHICH ARE -- REFER TO IS THAT A REFER TO IT AS THE SEXUAL ASSAULT EVIDENCE. AND THEN IT IS NOT THE DNA IF THEN THAT EVIDENCE IS LEFT ON THE SHELF. IN NO DNA IS EVER EXTRACTED. THEN WHY DID THE PERSON GO TO EVEN TO THE TROUBLE OF REPORTING IT WE'RE GOING TO THE MEDICAL EXAMINATION. SO [inaudible] TO INSURER THAT PEOPLE WHO SUFFER SEXUAL ASSAULT HAVE THE CONFIDENCE THAT THEIR CRIME WILL BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. WE MUST TEST ALL EVIDENCE FROM SEXUAL ASSAULTS I ASKED ZERO VOTE.

SEEING AND HEARING NONE ICE THIRTY EIGHT NO ZERO THE MEASURE PASSES FILE ITEM TO TWENTY TWO SENATOR ROSS DO YOU WISH TO TAKE UP THE SIDE OF PASS ON FILE FILE ITEMTO TWENTY THREE SENATOR ALAN. MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE READ FILE ITEM TWO TO THREE SENATE BILL FIFTY NUMBER SENATOR ALAN ACT RELATING TO A THOMAS VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY SENATOR ALAN. MEMBERS -- THE INTRODUCTION OF AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES HAS THE POTENTIAL. TO REVOLUTIONIZE THE HOW WE GET AROUND IN RESHAPING. OUR COMMUNITIES THAT IS SOME EXTRAORDINARY POTENTIAL BENEFITS RIGHT THE THE UNIT THIS INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY MAY DRASTICALLY REDUCE COLLISIONS. ME ENHANCE TRAFFIC FLOW -- THAT CERTAINLY VERY PROMISING. BUT ON THE FLIP SIDE IF NOT THOUGHT FULLY DEPLOYED -- THIS NEW TECH MOBILITY REVOLUTION COULD ACTUALLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACTS -- INCLUDING EXACERBATING CALIFORNIA'S ALREADY SEVERE CLIMB AND AIR QUALITY PLANNING AND CONGESTION CHALLENGES. ARE THERE WAS A RECENT STUDY FOR EXAMPLE THE CAME OUT THAT SHOWED THAT IT AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES ACTUALLY INCREASE. TRAFFIC -- THE THEY DID A STUDY. BASED ON GIVING FOLKS OF A ACCESS TO A FREE SHOW FOR WHO JUST. DRIVING AROUND WHENEVER THEY WANTED TO SEE WHAT SORT OF BEHAVIORS WITH WITH IN SU. AND THE PEOPLE A LITTLE HAVE THEIR DRIVER TO CIRCLE AROUND THE BLOCK SO AS NOT TO HAVE TO FIND PARKING AND PAY FOR PARKING -- YOU KNOW THESE TYPES OF GHOSTS TRIPS COULD UNDERCUT THE CONGESTION BENEFITS THAT WE EXPECT FROM REDUCE COLLISIONS THE OTHER THING IS THEY FOUND IT BECAUSE IT'S SO. NICE AND EASY CAN BE A NOT TO pWILLING TO GET -- BEHIND THE WHEEL AND AND AND TIED INTO A CAR AND AND AND AND DRIVE AROUND. SO THIS BILL CREATES AN INTERAGENCY WORK GROUP TO DELIBERATELY PLAN FOR AUTONOMOUS VEHICLES IN A WAY THAT SUPPORTS OUR GOALS. ARE HOUSING GOALS ARE PLANNING GOALS ARE SEEN THE BILL THE GOALS WITH THE MIND TOWARD AVOIDING POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS IT TAKES A AN ABSOLUTE DOESN'T COME IN WITH AN ATTITUDE THAT -- THIS IS A GOOD THING OR A BAD THING IT JUST SAYS THIS IS COMING. THERE'S A LOT OF POTENTIAL BENEFITS LET'S TRY TO MAXIMIZE THE BENEFITS AND MITIGATE THE NEGATIVES. OUR WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING INDUSTRY GROUPS AUTOMAKERS ENVIRONMENTALISTS -- AND AND AND AND CONSUMER GROUPS AS WELL TO REFINE THE MEASURE TO ENSURE THAT WE GOT OUT AHEAD OF THIS PARADIGM SHIFT IN -- AND BUT DO SO IN A WAY THAT DOESN'T STYMIE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGY AND SO THE MEASURE HAS. RECEIVED BIPARTISAN SUPPORT AND ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. DEBATE OR DISCUSSION DEBATE OR DISCUSSION ON THIS ITEM SENATOR GLAZERS -- OUT OF PRESIDENT NOT A PRESIDENT MEMBERS I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FROM -- SANTA MONICA FOR GETTING IN FRONT OF THE THIS THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT IT MEANS.

ARE THERE ARE -- IMPACTS BEYOND WHICH YOU THINK IDENTIFIED IN THE BILL CERTAINLY -- FOR THOSE WHO CURRENTLY ARE DRIVERS OF VEHICLES IN OUR OUR WORLD. AND THEN IN ADDITION TO PLANNING FOR MANY OF THE ISSUES THAT -- HE RAISES IN THE BILL I THINK PLANNING FOR THE DISPLACEMENT OF WORKERS IS ANOTHER VERY IMPORTANT IMPACT -- THAT SHOULD BE CONSIDERED GOING FORWARD AND I ENCOURAGE YOU TO TO LOOK AT THAT DOING THAT THANK YOU.

I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR WOULD YOU ACCEPT THE QUESTION YES YES WITHOUT OBJECTION THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT -- TO SENATOR I HAVE BEEN -- ENJOYING THIS SUBJECT AND ONE OF THE AREAS THAT WE'VE BEEN EXPLORING IS THE ABILITY MAYBE TO ADD NEW LANES. THAT WOULD PROVIDE AN ABILITY FOR THOMAS VEHICLES -- TO GET THEM OFF OF MAYBE THE MAJOR THOROUGHFARES AND NOT INTERFERE WITH GOODS MOVEMENT-O'DONNELL OTHER ACTIVITIES. WOULD THAT BE CONSIDERED A A POLICY RECOMMENDATION WITH REGARDS TO THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH. YEAH I KNOW THE THE HOLY BOB THROUGH THE CHAIR AT THE MANTA PRESIDENT -- THE THE THE THE THE IDEA HERE IS THAT ALL OF THOSE KINDS OF INNOVATIVE POLICY OPTIONS WOULD BE ON THE TABLE. AND THAT THE OFFICE THE OPR WOULD BE LOOKING AT ALL THESE VARIOUS OPTIONS. AND WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WERE WERE REALLY BEING THOUGHTFUL. I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE. WERE SOME THESE WONDERFUL BUT BUT PROTECT THE DESTRUCTIVE ELECTRIC SCOOTERS HAVE BEEN TO SORT OF LAID OUT ON UNDER THE ON THE CURBS -- AND YOU THERE THERE ARE SOME CHALLENGES HERE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE WE WE ALLOW THIS ROLL OUT IN A THOUGHTFUL WAY AND I WAS REALLY BE SOMETHING THAT THEY WOULD BE CONSIDERING.

AMOUNTS TO AN AUTO BURGLARY. UNDER CURRENT LAW -- THERE'S A QUIRK OR FRANKLY A LOOPHOLE -- DIE IN ORDER TO PROVE IN AUTUMN BURKE WHERE YOU HAVE TO PROVE. THAT THE VEHICLE WAS LOCKED WHICH IS OFTEN IMPOSSIBLE TO DO FOR EXAMPLE IF WITH A RENTAL CAR AT THE TOURIST HAS LEFT. OR IF SOMEONE DOES NOT REMEMBER WHETHER THEY LOCK THEIR CAR -- AND YOU HAVE TO PROVE THAT THE DOOR WAS LOCKED EVEN IF YOU HAVE ON VIDEO SOMEONE PASSING IN THE WINDOW TO GET INTO THE CAR. SO YOU CAN LOSE A PROSECUTION HAVING SOMEONE ON VIDEO PASSING THE WINDOW TO GET INTO THE CAR IF YOU'RE UNABLE TO PROVE BEYOND A REASONABLE DOUBT THAT. THE CAR WAS ALSO LAW.

IT REQUIRES A ELECTRICAL CORPORATION TO COULD LOOK INCLUDE IN THIS WILD FIRE MITIGATION PLAN. A DESCRIPTION OF HOW AND WHERE THEY HAVE CONSIDERED UNDER GROUNDING ELECTRICAL DISTRIBUTION LINES. IN AREAS OF THE HIGHEST WILDFIRE PROBABILITY. SO MUCH OF THE DIFFICULTIES INCLUDING THE CAMPFIRE. WAS RESULT OF A LINE COMING DOWN. THE LADY GENERAL LINES WILL COME DOWN NO MATTER HOW THE CITY IS ANY UTILITY IS AND MAINTAINING THOSE LINES. THE CAMPFIRE WE WERE DEALING WITH A FIFTY MILE AN HOUR WINDS. CHANNEL THROUGH CANYONS THAT INCREASED EVEN THE PHILOSOPHY IN THE PRESSURE. SO WHAT WILL HAPPEN. BUT SIMPLY CONSIDERING UNDER GROUNDING. I BELIEVE IS IMPORTANT. AND THE APPLICATION OF IT WHATEVER'S APPROPRIATE. AND MAKE ARGUMENTS. ABOUT ITS EFFICACY AS WELL. ALSO OPEN UP APPROPRIATION BY THE LEGISLATURE IT WOULD CREATE A WORKING GROUP. TO ASSIST IN DIRECTING THE PROJECT. IMPLEMENTATION. MOST OF THESE FIRES IS OF NOTED OR ABOVE GROUND. THE ARE THE RESULT.

IT IS A GREAT WAY FOR OUR UTILITIES TO HARDEN THEIR INFRASTRUCTURE. WHEN WE CONSIDER THE COSTS OF THIS? IT MUST BE CONSIDERED. AND I WOULD THIS IS WORKING GROUP. CONSIDER SUCH. THE COSTS OF THE FIRES. THE LIABILITY TO THE UTILITY ITSELF. THE COST TO THE COMMUNITY. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND IN MANY CASES AS IS THE CAMP CASE. THE LIVES OF OUR CITIZENS. NOT A MANDATE.

SENATE BILL SEVENTY TWO BY SENATOR UMBERG AN ACCOLADE INTO ELECTIONS SENATOR ON BURKE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. LAST YEAR MARKED THE FIRST TIME. THE CALIFORNIA -- ENACTED ENABLED SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION FOR STATEWIDE ELECTION OF THE LAW. THAT TIME REQUIRED THAT VOTERS AND A COMPLETE A CONDITIONAL VOTER REGISTRATION. AFFIDAVIT AND THEN CAST A PROVISIONAL BALLOT. THIS PROVISIONAL BALLOT WAS TABULATED ONLY AFTER IT WAS CHECKED AGAINST THE SO SECURITY DATABASE AS WELL AS DMV RECORDS -- TO ENSURE THE VOTER HAD NOT ALREADY RECEIVED THE BALLOT ELSEWHERE. IN MANY WAYS THE SYSTEM WORK VERY WELL FOR INSTANCE OVER FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND SAME DAY BALLOTS WERE CAST THE GENERAL ELECTION ALONE. THE SECTORS STATE REPORTS THERE WERE NO REPORT INSTANCES OF FRAUD ASSOCIATED WITH THEM ANYWHERE IN THE STATE. OF THE PROBLEM IS IS THAT THOSE SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION -- AFFIDAVITS AS WELL AS PROVISIONAL BALLOTS COULD ONLY BE CASTED VOTE CENTERS OR AT FOR EXAMPLE THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS OFFICE WHICH WOULD MEAN THAT SOME. PLACE SOME PLACES IN CALIFORNIA TRAVEL HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILES TO GET TO A LOCATION WHERE YOU CAN REGISTER. ON THAT SAME DAY I KNOW FROM MY OWN EXPERIENCE SEEING THE ORANGE COUNTY REGISTRAR VOTERS THAT VOTERS ARE LINED UP FOR MANY HOURS AFTER THE POLLS CLOSE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE. TO CAST THEIR BALLOTS AND EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT OF FRANCHISE NOW WITH THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY DO IS IS IT WOULD ALLOW. FOR SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION -- AT VOTE CENTERS AS WELL AS POLLING PLACES IN THOSE LOCATIONS WHICH CHOOSE NOT TO HAVE. VOTES CENTERS AS WELL AS THE PRE EXISTING LAW AT THE REGISTRAR OF VOTERS EACH COUNTY -- EITHER TONIGHT VOTE. THANK YOU ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR NIELSEN. NOT A PRESENT LATER DOWN THE SENATE TO I'M NOT HERE TO READ DEBATE AN ISSUE THAT I VIGOROUSLY OPPOSE. AND I WILL NOT EVEN DEBATE THAT SOME FOR WE HAVE NOT HAD PROBLEMS. BUT I WILL SAY UNEQUIVOCALLY I AM CERTAIN THAT WE WILL HAVE PROBLEMS. OF ALL THE OTHER STATES AND I UNDERSTAND HERE IN OUR ANALYSIS THERE ARE. SEVENTEEN THAT ALLOW SAME DAY VOTING. ONLY CALIFORNIA DOES NOT REQUIRE PROOF OF IDENTITY [inaudible] A RESIDENCY. WERE THOSE PROVISIONS INCLUDED IN THIS LEGISLATION. THAT AS YOU SHOWED UP AT THE POLLS YOU HAD TO HAVE A PROOF OF IDENTITY AND THE PROOF OF REGISTRATION WHERE YOU LEFT. THEN I'D HAVE SOMETHING TO VOTE FOR BUT SHORT OF THIS. I STATE THAT THIS IS STILL FRAUGHT WITH FRAUD. AND ORIGINAL VOTE. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING ON SENATOR UMBERG YOU MAY CLOSE -- THANK YOU OF MEN PRESENT I AM NOT FAMILIAR WITH SAME DAY VOTER REGISTRATION OR AT LEAST THE DETAILS IN OTHER STATES WHICH PERMITTED. I TAKE YOU AT YOUR WORD -- CENTER NIELSEN THAT SEVENTEEN STATES PROVIDE SAME DAY ROAD VOTER REGISTRATION. HOWEVER IN CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO SHOW AND TO DEMONSTRATE TO ENSURE ALL OF US THAT THOSE VOTES ARE CAST IS PROPERLY. DONE BY CITIZENS THERE IS A CHECK.

SENATE BILL ONE FIFTY NINE BY SENATOR WINNER AN ACT RELATING TO HIV PREVENTION SENATOR WIENER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT ARE CALLING SIDE SP -- ONE FIFTY NINE IS A BILL TO EXPAND ACCESS. TO TO VERY POWERFUL HIV PREVENTION DRUGS CRAP AND PAP CRAP IS PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PAP IS POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS. RAP IS A ONCE DAILY PILL THAT REDUCES RISK OF HIV BY ABOUT 99% ALMOST ENTIRELY ELIMINATING THE RISK OF HIV INFECTION. HAPPY IS A TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE THAT YOU TAKE IF YOU BELIEVE THAT YOU HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO HIV -- TO TRY TO PREVENT THE VIRUS FROM TAKING HOLD IN YOUR BODY -- THESE DRUGS ARE GAME CHANGERS IN OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY TO ELIMINATE NEW HIV INFECTIONS. UNFORTUNATELY -- WE HAVE STRUGGLED IN INCREASING UPTAKE OF THESE IMPORTANT TOOLS PARTICULARLY -- CRAP -- AND PARTICULARLY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING IN OUR POWER TO EXPAND ACCESS. SB ONE FIFTY NINE WILL EXPAND ACCESS IN TWO WAYS -- FIRST TO AUTHORIZE PHARMACISTS WITHOUT A PHYSICIAN'S. PRESCRIPTION TO PROVIDE THE FULL TWENTY EIGHT DAY COURSE OF PAP -- POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS AND THE FIRST THIRTY DAYS OF CRAP. AFTER THIRTY DAYS SOMEONE WILL THEN HAVE TO MAKE SURE THEY HAVE THE BLOOD WORK AND GO SEE A POSITION TO CONTINUE. BOB THIS WILL HELP GET PEOPLE ACCESS EASIER AND GET PEOPLE GOING MORE EASILY -- WE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH -- THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTEE AND WITH THE HEALTH COMMITTEE ON THIS BILL AND I THINK WE'VE COME TO A GOOD STRUCTURE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE PROTECTING PEOPLE'S HEALTH. AND EXPANDING ACCESS THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS BILL IS -- SP ONE FIFTY NINE PROHIBITS BY INSURANCE COMPANIES FROM REQUIRING PRIOR AUTHORIZATIONS TO ACCESS PROP AND PAP. THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO BASIS TO HAVE A PRIOR AUTHORIZATION AND IS SIMPLY THE LAYS ACCESS -- THERE'VE BEEN PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME HIV POSITIVE BECAUSE OF THESE DELAYS -- AND IT'S NOT ACCEPTABLE -- SO COLLEAGUES WE HAVE A BROAD COALITION BEHIND THIS BILL OF HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS IT THE ODD BECAUSE LGBT CIVIL RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. ANY DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR STONE. THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT -- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE FIFTY NINE WHICH I THINK MAYBE ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT BILLS THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE ENTERTAINED THIS THE SESSION. THE BILL INCREASES ACCESSIBILITY TO PREVENTIVE HEALTHCARE THE FIGHT THE SPREAD OF HIV AND AIDS. IN ADDITION IT REMOVES BARRIERS FOR SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIMS SEEKING TIMELY ACCESS TO PASS. BY ALLOWING PHARMACISTS TO PROVIDE THE HIV PRE EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS TO PREP. AND POST EXPOSURE PROPHYLAXIS PAP [inaudible] TWO PATIENTS. IT'S NOT A MERE MYTH BUT A SIMPLE FACT THAT INCREASING ACCESS TO PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE GREATLY FIGHTS THE SPREAD. OF HIV AND AIDS. SO BASICALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS TWO THINGS. IT ALLOWS FOR GREATER ACCESSIBILITY FOR PATIENTS THAT NEED THE ACUTE TREATMENT OF CRAP. BY GOING TO ONE OF FIVE THOUSAND PHARMACY IS A CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA [inaudible] AND TO IT STOPS THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS IS SOMETIMES CAN DRAG ON FOR DAYS. BUT IS VERY IMPORTANT IF THESE DRUGS ARE GOING TO WORK THEY HAVE TO BE TAKE TAKEN IN A VERY TIMELY WAY. THAT'S LESS THAN SEVENTY TWO HOURS FOR THE DRUGS SIMPLY DO NOT WORK. WHEN I WAS WORKING FOR MY DOCTOR PHARMACY DEGREE U. S. C.? I ACTUALLY DID ROUNDS WITH PHYSICIANS AT THE COUNTY USC HOSPITAL. WE OFTEN TOOK MANY THE SAME CLASSES TOGETHER -- AT WITH MEDICAL STUDENTS SUCH AS ANATOMY HISTOLOGY PHYSIOLOGY PHARMACOLOGY BY MEDICINAL CHEMISTRY. IT IS NOT A UNIQUE IDEA THE PHARMACISTS ARE ABLE TO ADMINISTER MEDICATION THE FACT IS MOST OF YOU KNOW YOU CAN GET IMMUNIZED TO JUST ABOUT. ANY PHARMACY IN THE TATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT AS PHARMACISTS THAT ARE SPECIALLY TRAINED. TO DO SO. AND WITH THAT WE OF INCREASE THE THE HERD -- IMMUNIZATION RATE -- PROTECTING OUR OUR COMMUNITIES. AND AT THE END OF THE DAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF SB FOUR NINETY THREE WE CODIFIED INTO LAW. THE PHARMACISTS ARE MODIFIED HEALTH CARE PROVIDERS THUS WE PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE. IN THE DELIVERY OF HEALTH CARE FOR PATIENTS. AS I MENTIONED IS OVER FIVE THOUSAND PHARMACIES AND CITY CALIFORNIA AND MANY. ESPECIALLY SOME OF THESE CHAIN STORES ARE OPEN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A DAY. SO IF THERE IS A THE EMERGENT NEED. FOR PRESS OR PAP. A PATIENT CAN GET THOSE DRUGS -- EASILY. AND IN A TIMELY WAY. LET'S FACE IT. ONE DOESN'T ALWAYS PLANNED ACTS OF PASSION. SOMETIMES THINGS JUST HAPPEN. BUT IF YOU NEED PROP OR PAT. AND YOU NEED TO GO THROUGH A DOCTOR TO GET IT TODAY. ANY NEED TO GO TO THE PRIOR AUTHORIZATION PROCESS CHANCES ARE. YOU MAY NOT GET TO THE INFECTION IN TIME WORD ACTION BECOMES. AN ACTIVE INFECTION. BEYOND SEVENTY TWO HOURS. THE LAYS THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE DRUGS WERE THEY JUST DON'T WORK. LET'S LEAVE IT UP TO THE INDIVIDUALS THAT KNOW WHAT THEY'RE GOING THROUGH AND KNOW THAT THEY WILL. NEED TO GET MEDICATIONS TO PREVENT. THEIR HEALTH FROM DETERIORATING. WE HAVE PROOF THE PHARMACIST CAN TAKE ON MORE PROFESSIONAL ROLES LIKE DESCRIBING AND GIVING INNOVATIONS AND WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO EXPAND THE PROFESSIONAL ROLES. TO PREVENT MORE CASES OF AIDS. WE NEED TO ELIMINATE AIDS JUST LIKE WE ELIMINATED POLIO. WE HAVE THE DRUGS AVAILABLE AND THEY ARE SAFE AND THEY ARE EFFECTIVE. BUT SIMPLY PEOPLE JUST DON'T HAVE ACCESS. AS A SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO MENTIONED THE UPTAKE OF THESE DRUGS UNFORTUNATELY IS LOW MUCH LOWER THAN WE WOULD LIKE AND AGAIN IT GOES BACK TO ACCESSIBILITY AND TIMELY APPROVALS OF THESE DRUGS. WITH THE APPROPRIATE PROTOCOLS AN INCREASE ACCESSIBILITY ESPECIALLY IN AREAS OF COLOR. WHERE WE SEE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE AND PERFECT BROUGHT UNDER ITS OF AIDS ATTRIBUTED TO THE FACT THAT THESE INDIVIDUALS DON'T KNOW? THAT THESE PREVENTED OF DRUGS. ARE READILY AVAILABLE. WE COULD GREATLY REDUCE THE MORBIDITY AND LONG TERM SENTENCE OF PATIENTS THAT WILL COME DOWN WITH THE AIDS VIRUS. THIS BILL NOT ONLY COULD SAVE A LIFE BUT COULD ALSO GIVE HOPE TO THOSE WHO ARE RISK. OF GETTING HIV AND AIDS. THANK YOU TO MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE BEST INTEREST OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WHOLLY SUPPORT SB ONE FIFTY NINE AND KIRCHER AYE VOTE SENATOR PAN. I THANK YOU -- MADAM PRESIDENT SENATORS UP FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO -- FOR CERTAINLY ASSURE HIS GOAL OF TRYING TO ELIMINATE HIV AND ALSO A SHARE HIS GOAL OF INCREASING ACCESS. TO THESE ARE VERY IMPORTANT -- MEDICATIONS THAT ARE NECESSARY TO HELP BOTH LIMIT THE SPREAD AND HOPEFULLY -- LIMIT -- OF WE GET EXCEEDS ELIMINATION OF HIV AND IN FACT -- I THINK IN MANY WAYS I THINK MOST OF THE COMPONENTS OF THE BILL IN FACT I'VE HAD SOME EXCELLENT CONVERSATIONS -- I A SUPPORT MAY SUPPORT STRONGLY AND I APPRECIATE THAT ICE -- THAT HE IS TRYING TO IMPROVE ACCESS TO THESE MEDICATIONS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE NEED TO DO -- UNFORTUNATELY I HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE SUPPORT THE BILL BECAUSE I'VE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT. HOW TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE CLOSE THE LOOP AND BE SURE THAT IT IS PEOPLE ARE SEEKING CARE? THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO GET -- THE HIGH QUALITY CONFERENCE OF CARE THEY NEED NOW I WILL SAY MY GOOD FRIEND TO TO MACULA THAT YES PHARMACISTS HAVE A VERY IMPORTANT ROLE. AND IN FACT PHARMACIST CAN DO A LOT IN FACT I HAVE NO OBJECTION TO THE IDEA THAT PHARMACISTS ARE GOING TO BE DISPENSING. OF BOTH PAP WHICH WE KNOW HAS A TIME LIMIT TIME FRAME IN WHICH SOMEONE HE'S RECEIVED THE MEDICATION SEVENTY TWO HOURS. OR PERHAPS WHICH IS ACTUALLY A MORE PREVENTIVE CARE -- TREATMENT SO IT'S TO PREVENT GETTING INFECTED -- SO THERE'S A LITTLE LESS TIME AGENCY THERE BUT I'M FINE WITH PHARMACISTS ADMINISTERING THAT MEDICATION THE QUESTION THEN BECOMES IS THAT BECAUSE AND I APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE THE ANTI COMMITTEE -- AS WELL AS WELL AS THE HEALTH ME THAT. UNDER THE GUIDELINES OF COURSE -- THERE ARE SCREENING TESTS -- NAMELY RENAL SCREENING TESTS THAT NEED TO BE CONDUCTED -- BECAUSE OF ATTENTIONAL SIDE EFFECTS THAT MIGHT RESULT FROM THE MEDICATION AND IT'S A FAIRLY RARE BUT IT IT'S IT'S A POSSIBILITY THE OTHER THING I WOULD MAKE NOTE THOUGH IS IS THAT ALSO -- PATIENTS WHO ARE GETTING SCREEN WITH THIS TEST EVEN IF THEY DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM CAUSED BY THE MEDICATION THEY COULD HAVE A PRE EXISTING. CONDITION THAT MAYBE EARLY ON THAT AS ONLY IDENTIFIED BY THAT TEST. AND IN THIS BILL THE PHARMACIST WILL BE ADMINISTERING A MEDICATION WHICH IS FINE I'M FINE WITH THAT AND ALSO -- THEN ALSO DOING THE SCREENING TEST. AND THEN THE QUESTION IS WHO'S REVIEWING THE SCREENING TEST RESULTS THIS IS NOT MERELY A MEDICATION LEVEL WHERE YOU GO OUT F THE MEDICATION IS NOW AT A SUFFICIENT DOSE OR NOT. IT'S NOT AN UP AND DOWN TEST THIS IS A SOMEWHAT MORE COMPLEX AND SO IN THOSE CIRCUMSTANCES THEN THE ISSUE ECOMES WELL. WHO IS RESPONSIBLE FOR INTERPRETING TEST AND THEN COMMUNICATING WITH THE PATIENT HAS TO THE ROOT THOSE RESULTS -- AND SO I APPRECIATE THAT IN THE BILL AND DUE TO MENACE ARE TAKEN THE BILL THAT FOR CRAP SO WE'RE GONNA. HAVE TO SIDE WHICH CAN TALK ABOUT WHICH IS THE PREVENTIVE PART THAT IN THAT TREATMENT THAT THEY CAN ONLY GET ESSENTIALLY ONE CYCLE ONE ONE ROUND OF TREATMENTS AND AND WHICH CASE THEY THEN NEED TO SEE -- WHAT THEY COULD GO TO ANOTHER PHARMACY -- BUT WHO WHO DOESN'T COMMUTE YOUNG COMMUNICATE FAR BUT IDEALLY THEY WOULD GO IDEALLY SEEK A A PHYSICIAN OR SOME OTHER -- PERSON -- OF HIS DECISION A POSITION TEAM AND I AND I THINK THAT -- BUT I MY CONCERN IS IS IS THAT BECAUSE ESPECIALLY FOR THE PEOPLE DON'T HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE -- FOR A PRIMARY CARE TEAM TO HAVE A PHYSICIAN NOW THEY'RE THEY'RE GONNA GET A FOLLOW UP RATE THAT THE LAB TESTS WILL GO TO THEM TO GET INTERPRETED. THIS BILL WILL TRY TO EXPAND ACCESS AND I WOULD POINT OUT THAT SO ONE OF THE THINGS I SUGGESTED -- WAS IS THAT. THE PHARMACIST SHOULD HAVE A CLEVER PRACTICE AGREEMENT WITH A POSITION TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A PHYSICIAN WHO ACTUALLY HAS REALLY SHE'S BUT THE PHARMACIST TO HELP. THE FED BY IS THEM TO REVIEW THE TASK TO DO ANYTHING THE PHARMACIST HAS. HAS QUESTIONS ABOUT IN FACT AGAIN WE'RE NOT TELLING THE PHARMACIST THAT THEY CAN'T JUST DISPENSE THE MEDICATION BUT THEY SHOULD HAVE SOMEONE TEY CAN GO REFER TO THERE'S A QUESTION -- NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT THAT WOULD MAKE IT THAT PHARMACISTS MAYBE WON'T DO IT IF THEY HAVE TO GET A CLOUT FACT THIS AGREEMENT. AND THAT IT WAS ALSO SAID THAT WELL PHYSICIANS WOULDN'T AGREE TO DO THIS BECAUSE THE RISK WOULD BE TOO HIGH. ALTHOUGH I POINT OUT THAT OF THE RISK IS TOO HIGH FOR POSITION TO HAVE THIS AGREEMENT AND BY THE WAY THERE'D BE NO LIMITATION ON THE NUMBER PHARMACIST A PHYSICIAN COULD HAVE THIS AGREEMENT WITH -- THEN I WOULD SAY THAT THE PHARMACIST THEMSELVES IF THE PHYSICIANS CANNOT GET THINK THE RISK IS TOO HIGH I'M NOT SURE WHAT IT MEANS FOR PHARMACISTS WHO DOESN'T HAVE ANYONE. THIS BACKING THEM UP. SO I'M NOT ACTUALLY A STAND HERE AND URGE ANYONE NOT TO VOTE FOR THE BILL AND FORTY I CANNOT. BUT I KNOW AND I I CERTAINLY HAVE A LOT OF FAITH MY FRIEND FROM SAN FRANCISCO I HOPE WE CAN TRY TO WORK. THIS ISSUE OUT BEFORE THE BILL BILL ENDS UP ON THE GOVERNOR'S DESK ARE SIGNED INTO LAW BECAUSE I DO THINK THIS IS A CRITICAL PART WE TALK ABOUT TEAM BASED CARE. THIS IS REALLY ABOUT HOW DO WE BUILD THE TEAM TO BE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN GET. HIGH QUALITY CARE SO WITH THAT I AM FOR SHE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO VOTE FOR THE BILL -- TODAY BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR BECAUSE I KNOW WE SHARE THE SAME GOALS I KNOW HE SHARES THAT GOAL -- AND THAT HOPEFULLY WE CAN LAND THIS BILL IN A PLACE THAT -- WILL BE SURE AND I KNOW THAT'S HIS DESIRE TO THAT OF PEOPLE ARE GOING TO GET HIGH QUALITY CARE AND THAT WE'RE GOING TO KEEP PEOPLE SAFE THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION SENATOR GLAZER. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MEMBERS. AT THIS THOUGHTFUL DEBATE ON THE FLOOR TODAY -- WAS REFLECTIVE OF THE THE DEEP. CONSIDERATION AT THIS MEASURE HAD AND CERTAINLY IN FRONT OF THE BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS COMMITTED I'M SURE THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. I IN THAT ACT BROAD CONSULTATIONS WERE UNDERTAKING WITH THE MEDICAL COMMUNITY -- AND WITH OTHERS ABOUT -- THIS ISSUE THAT THE SENATOR FROM SINCE SAN FRANCISCO SO PROPERLY BROUGHT FORWARD TO US. AND AND TWO CONCLUSIONS THAT I SHARE WITH YOU. ONE IS THAT. IN A PERFECT WORLD -- THIS TYPE OF HEALTH CARE WOULD BE DIRECTED BY A PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN. THAT -- FOLKS WOULD HAVE. THAT INITIATE THAT CONTACT BEFORE PROBLEM OCCURS. I CERTAINLY BE ABLE. TO REACH THAT PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIAN WITHIN SEVENTY TWO HOURS AFTER -- THAT THEIR BELIEF THAT A PROBLEM HAS OCCURRED -- BUT THE PRACTICAL NATURE OF THIS IS THAT -- THE PERFECT CAN'T BE THE ENEMY OF THE GOOD -- THAT WAS CAN'T CONCLUSION NUMBER. ONE ISSUE NUMBER TWO WAS THAT -- WE CAREFULLY EXAMINED. THE GUIDELINES FROM THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL IN REGARD TO THESE -- DOSAGES THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED FOR PREP AND FOR PAT. AND THE CONCLUSION THAT -- I CERTAINLY CAME TO I THINK OUR OUR COMMITTEE CAME -- TO IS THAT. THE HEALTH CARE CONSEQUENCES OF ADMINISTERING ONE DOES. TWENTY EIGHT TO THIRTY DAYS -- WAS EXTREMELY EXTREMELY LOW -- TO THAT INDIVIDUAL AND WHILE FOLLOW UP CARE IS RECOMMENDED AND AND IT'S CERTAINLY -- SHOULD BE DONE. THAT AGAIN THE CONSEQUENCES TO THAT INDIVIDUAL -- IF IT WERE NOT TO OCCUR WERE INCREDIBLY SMALL. AND SO THE CHOICE THAT I BELIEVE ARE COMMITTEE MADE -- WAS IT THIS -- SINGLE DOSE FOR PREP AND FOR PAT -- STRUCK THE RIGHT CHORD FOR A PRAGMATIC WAY TO DEAL WITH -- A SERIOUS HEALTH CARE CONSEQUENCE WHICH CITY IS A GOOD AUTHOR OF SAN FRANCISCO IS CORRECTLY IDENTIFIED. AND WITH THAT NUMBERS I PRAISE VISIT THE SENATOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO FOR LEADING ON THIS ISSUE AND I ENCOURAGE AND I'VE OF FURTHER DEBATE AND DISCUSSION SENATOR STONE BETTER PRESIDENT JUST REAL FAST I JUST WANT --TO LET MY COLLEAGUES KNOW THAT -- WHEN WE WENT OF WHEN I WENT TO PHARMACY SCHOOL AND? IN PHARMACY SCHOOLS TODAY WE'RE TALK ABOUT THE INTERPRETATION OF OF LAB RESULTS AND WE CAN ORDER TESTS. AND WE CERTAINLY CAN IT IN IN THIS CASE IF ORDERING OF A BLOOD TEST THAT CAN. HELP IDENTIFY WHETHER NOT SOMEBODY'S HAVING A SIDE EFFECT NAMELY TO THE KIDNEYS WITH RESPECT TO OF ONE OF THESE DRUGS. AND SECONDLY I DON'T WANT YOU TO THINK THAT. WERE YOU KNOW -- INVENTING A NEW. A NEW PROGRAM HERE THERE ARE PROGRAMS THAT EXIST IN WASHINGTON AND THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THAT ALLOW. FOR EITHER. CRAP OR HAPPY. IN SOME CASES ONE BUT NOT THE OTHER IN THESE TWO STATES SO THEY SAW THE WISDOM IN THESE TWO STATES TO REDUCE THE INCIDENCE OF HIV AIDS. AND I HOPE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO DO THE SAME HERE CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU. ANY FURTHER DEBATE OR DISCUSSION. SEEING AND HEARING NONE SENATOR WINNER YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE THE INTELLIGENT AND THOUGHTFUL DEBATE ABOUT THIS AND I'VE ENJOYED MY CONVERSATIONS WITH BOTH. THE CENTER FOR MARANDA AND THE CENTER SACRAMENTO HE'S A CENTER FROM TO MACULA HAS BEEN A GROUP RATE PARTNER IN THIS BILL. ON A TO BE CLEAR -- THE RISK OF RENAL PROBLEMS FROM -- THESE MEDICATIONS IS VERY VERY LOW I THINK EVERYONE ACKNOWLEDGES THAT IT DOES HAPPEN VERY LOW AS WE HEARD -- FROM A PHYSICIAN WHO TESTIFIED IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE WHO IS PROBABLY THE FOREMOST PHYSICIAN EXPR ON PROP IMPACT IN THE WORLD -- THAT WHEN THEY DO RARELY HAPPEN IT'S USUALLY AFTER THREE OR FOUR MONTHS IT DOESN'T REALLY HAPPEN IN THOSE FIRST THIRTY DAYS -- SO THE RISK HERE IS SO INTERNAL TOUGH INFINITESIMALLY LOW IN TERMS OF ADVERSE HEALTH -- AL COME. BUT WE KNOW THAT WE WILL PREVENT HIV INFECTIONS -- AND THE ONE FINAL THING I WANT TO KNOW IN TERMS OF THE SUGGESTION OF A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE IN REAL LIFE COURSE -- AS IT EXPRESSES CENTER IN SACRAMENTO I APPRECIATE THAT IDEA -- WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THAT UNFORTUNATELY IT DOESN'T WORK EITHER PHYSICIANS OR PHARMACIST LIKE ENTERING INTO THESE AGREEMENTS. AND WHEN THE LEGISLATURE FIRST AUTHORIZED PHARMACISTS TO PROVIDE VACCINES BACK IN THE NINETEEN NINETIES A COLLABORATIVE PRACTICE AGREEMENT WAS REQUIRED AND NOT LAW. IT WAS A FAILURE VERY FEW PHARMACISTS AND PHYSICIANS ADDED INTO THOSE THOSE AGREEMENTS AND WITHIN THE LAST TEN YEARS THE LEGISLATURE DELETED THAT REQUIREMENT FROM THE LAW -- I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ALL DEBATE HAVING SEIZED MISTER SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ALLEN [inaudible] I ARCHULETA [inaudible] ATKINS [inaudible] BATES [inaudible] BELL [inaudible] I PORGES [inaudible] I BRADFORD.
