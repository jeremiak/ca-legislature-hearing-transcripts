THIS.

00:27:38.757 --> 00:27:42.895 region:rollup2
OUT.

00:27:40.859 --> 00:27:44.329 region:rollup2
PROBABLY THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE.

00:27:42.895 --> 00:27:46.331 region:rollup2
IN IMPLEMENTING THE PROGRAM

00:27:44.329 --> 00:27:48.167 region:rollup2
THERE'S IS THIS TRANSITION THAT

00:27:46.331 --> 00:27:50.402 region:rollup2
HAPPENED RECENTLY BETWEEN COUNTY

00:27:48.167 --> 00:27:52.371 region:rollup2
OF SERVICE AND COUNT TO COUNTY

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:53.939 region:rollup2
OF RESPONSIBILITY. IT GETS KINDA

00:27:52.371 --> 00:27:55.541 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED BUT UNDER THE OLD

00:27:53.939 --> 00:27:57.209 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:27:55.541 --> 00:27:59.745 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT IN OUR FIELD A

00:27:57.209 --> 00:28:02.047 region:rollup2
CLIENTS TEND TO MOVE THEY THEY.

00:27:59.745 --> 00:28:03.382 region:rollup2
MIGHT SEEK SERVICES IN COUNTIES

00:28:02.047 --> 00:28:05.150 region:rollup2
OTHER THAN THAT I COUNTY WHERE

THEY ARE RESIDE OR WHERE THERE

00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.587 region:rollup2
MEDI CAL WAS ESTABLISHED AND SO

00:28:06.985 --> 00:28:10.188 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A LOT OF MOVEMENT. OF

00:28:08.587 --> 00:28:11.790 region:rollup2
CLIENTS TO GO TO OTHER COUNTIES

00:28:10.188 --> 00:28:13.358 region:rollup2
UNDER THE OLD SYSTEM THE

PROVIDER THAT WAS LOCATED IN IN

00:28:13.358 --> 00:28:16.962 region:rollup2
ONE COUNTY EVEN IF THEY WERE

COUNTIES THAT THAT COUNTY

00:28:18.931 --> 00:28:22.034 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY WAS HAVE THE

SERVICE HAD THE CONTRACT WITHOUT

00:28:23.802 --> 00:28:27.072 region:rollup2
PROVIDER SO THE PROVIDER WOULD

00:28:25.671 --> 00:28:28.774 region:rollup2
BASICALLY. YOU KNOW SEND THE

00:28:27.072 --> 00:28:30.742 region:rollup2
CLAIM TO THE COUNTING WHICH THEY

00:28:28.774 --> 00:28:32.044 region:rollup2
WERE LOCATED THAT I UP COUNTY

00:28:30.742 --> 00:28:33.412 region:rollup2
WOULD PAY THEM AND THEN WOULD

00:28:32.044 --> 00:28:35.314 region:rollup2
WOULD SUBMIT THE CLAIMS TO THE

00:28:33.412 --> 00:28:35.914 region:rollup2
STATE REGARDLESS OF WHERE THE

00:28:35.314 --> 00:28:37.616 region:rollup2
CLIENTS CAME FROM.

00:28:35.914 --> 00:28:39.651 region:rollup2
UNDER THE TRANSITION TO COUNTY A

00:28:37.616 --> 00:28:42.187 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY NOW EACH COUNTY

00:28:39.651 --> 00:28:43.422 region:rollup2
IS RESPONSIBLE TO FOR THE IN THE

00:28:42.187 --> 00:28:44.690 region:rollup2
PEOPLE THAT RESIDE IN THAT

00:28:43.422 --> 00:28:47.192 region:rollup2
COUNTY REGARDLESS OF WHERE THEY

00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:49.328 region:rollup2
GO FOR SERVICES SO THIS MEANS.

00:28:47.192 --> 00:28:50.896 region:rollup2
THAT ONE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE

00:28:49.328 --> 00:28:53.098 region:rollup2
MIGHT HAVE ITS RESIDENTS GETTING

RECEIVE THE TREATMENT THAT WE

00:35:12.978 --> 00:35:16.047 region:rollup2
JUST DON'T THINK MAKES ANY SENSE

00:35:14.913 --> 00:35:18.516 region:rollup2
FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A

00:35:16.047 --> 00:35:20.085 region:rollup2
PROVIDER. IT ALSO DOESN'T MAKE

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.665 region:rollup2
IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY

00:41:40.098 --> 00:41:45.503 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE MAY

00:41:40.665 --> 00:41:51.476 region:rollup2
HAVE.

00:41:45.503 --> 00:41:52.043 region:rollup2
WHY?

00:41:51.476 --> 00:41:53.878 region:rollup2
HOW DID I MISS THAT AN ISSUE

00:41:52.043 --> 00:41:55.413 region:rollup2
ONE?

00:41:53.878 --> 00:41:56.948 region:rollup2
WE WERE TALKING ABOUT.

00:41:55.413 --> 00:41:59.517 region:rollup2
.

00:41:56.948 --> 00:42:00.017 region:rollup2
WE SEE. THAT THE TREATMENT

00:41:59.517 --> 00:42:01.953 region:rollup2
FACILITIES.

00:42:00.017 --> 00:42:03.755 region:rollup2
ARE WE COLLECTING COLLECTING

00:42:01.953 --> 00:42:05.623 region:rollup2
DATA ON THE NUMBER OF PATIENTS

00:42:03.755 --> 00:42:06.891 region:rollup2
ARE BEING DENIED INITIAL ACCESS

00:42:05.623 --> 00:42:08.092 region:rollup2
TO THOSE THAT ARE DISCHARGED

00:42:06.891 --> 00:42:14.265 region:rollup2
FROM TREATMENT AS A RESULT OF

00:42:08.092 --> 00:42:15.867 region:rollup2
THE OF THE CHANGES.

00:42:14.265 --> 00:42:18.136 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THIS IS IN REGARDS TO

00:42:15.867 --> 00:42:21.506 region:rollup2
THE REENTRY FACILITY YES. YES SO

00:42:18.136 --> 00:42:22.673 region:rollup2
I'M WE ARE WORKING AND BETWEEN

00:42:21.506 --> 00:42:25.343 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTIES.

00:42:22.673 --> 00:42:27.078 region:rollup2
AN OURSELVES TO.

00:42:25.343 --> 00:42:29.981 region:rollup2
READ YOU LOOK AT THE GUIDANCE

00:42:27.078 --> 00:42:32.350 region:rollup2

FROM ANYONE BEING REJECTED THIS

00:42:35.286 --> 00:42:36.721 region:rollup2
REALLY WAS.

00:42:35.586 --> 00:42:37.755 region:rollup2
.

00:42:36.721 --> 00:42:39.123 region:rollup2
AN ISSUE IN WHICH WE HAD

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:40.925 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT ELIGIBLE

00:42:39.123 --> 00:42:42.460 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE MEDICAID SERVICES

00:42:40.925 --> 00:42:44.729 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT.

00:42:42.460 --> 00:42:46.431 region:rollup2
ON PAROLE SO THERE WAS A VERY

00:42:44.729 --> 00:42:47.832 region:rollup2
KIND OF FINE LEGAL DISTINCTION

00:42:46.431 --> 00:42:49.100 region:rollup2
BETWEEN THEM AND SO THE

00:42:47.832 --> 00:42:51.402 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THAT WERE.

00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:52.970 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED IN THE LETTER

00:42:51.402 --> 00:42:54.539 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY ARE WE DON'T DISAGREE

00:42:52.970 --> 00:42:55.773 region:rollup2
THERE FIVE ONE C. THREES THEIR

00:42:54.539 --> 00:42:57.809 region:rollup2
TREATMENT FACILITIES THEY'RE

00:42:55.773 --> 00:43:00.211 region:rollup2
LICENSED AND OPERATED AS SUCH.

00:42:57.809 --> 00:43:02.613 region:rollup2
AND SO WE'RE WORKING TO EITHER

00:43:00.211 --> 00:43:03.881 region:rollup2
REVISE OR CLARIFY THE GUIDANCE

00:43:02.613 --> 00:43:05.349 region:rollup2
FOR INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE.

00:43:03.881 --> 00:43:07.118 region:rollup2
.

00:43:05.349 --> 00:43:08.653 region:rollup2
THE INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE WITHIN

00:43:07.118 --> 00:43:10.054 region:rollup2
THE CORRECTIONAL JURISDICTION

00:43:08.653 --> 00:43:12.423 region:rollup2
ARE IN A RE ENTRY PROGRAM AND

00:43:10.054 --> 00:43:15.893 region:rollup2
THERE'S A NUMBER OF.

00:43:12.423 --> 00:43:17.595 region:rollup2
WHO HAD THIS?

00:43:15.893 --> 00:43:19.564 region:rollup2
HAS QUITE STRONG THUNDER AND

00:43:17.595 --> 00:43:21.032 region:rollup2
THERE ARE SEVERAL REENTRY

PROGRAMS OF CORRECTIONS OPERATES

00:43:21.032 --> 00:43:23.835 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S LIKE THE FEMALE

00:43:21.699 --> 00:43:25.203 region:rollup2
OFFENDER PROGRAM THERE'S THE

00:43:23.835 --> 00:43:26.304 region:rollup2
SOMETHING SOMETHING AND SO WE

00:43:25.203 --> 00:43:27.605 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAKE SURE WHEN WE

00:43:26.304 --> 00:43:29.140 region:rollup2
ISSUE THE GUIDANCE TO THE

00:43:27.605 --> 00:43:30.241 region:rollup2
COUNTIES BECAUSE THEY WERE ALSO.

00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.042 region:rollup2
CONFUSED BECAUSE YOU HAD

00:43:30.241 --> 00:43:32.043 region:rollup2

00:43:32.043 --> 00:43:34.912 region:rollup2
FACILITIES BUT THEY WERE UNDER A

00:43:33.544 --> 00:43:36.414 region:rollup2
CORRECTIONAL JURISDICTION SO

00:43:34.912 --> 00:43:37.281 region:rollup2
WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT.

00:43:36.414 --> 00:43:38.649 region:rollup2
THE GUIDANCE THAT WE GIVE TO THE

00:43:37.281 --> 00:43:39.851 region:rollup2

00:44:07.645 --> 00:44:11.115 region:rollup2
WITH CORRECTIONS WE'VE BEEN IN

00:44:08.846 --> 00:44:13.351 region:rollup2

WHAT ARE WE DOING ON THE WORK

00:44:29.433 --> 00:44:32.737 region:rollup2
FOR SIDE OF THE EQUATION AND

00:44:31.068 --> 00:44:33.905 region:rollup2
SHOULD WE BE DOING MORE?

00:44:32.737 --> 00:44:35.940 region:rollup2
SURE SO I THINK.

00:44:33.905 --> 00:44:37.675 region:rollup2
.

00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:39.310 region:rollup2
THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF

00:44:37.675 --> 00:44:41.579 region:rollup2
EFFORT UNDERWAY ON WAS A SISTER

00:44:39.310 --> 00:44:42.180 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF OURS RATE SO

00:44:41.579 --> 00:44:43.114 region:rollup2
AWESOME IT WHICH IS OFFICES

00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:45.316 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND

00:44:43.114 --> 00:44:48.019 region:rollup2
DEVELOPMENT. THEY RUN SEVERAL.

00:44:45.316 --> 00:44:49.287 region:rollup2
WORK FORCE TYPE OF PROGRAMS I

00:44:48.019 --> 00:44:50.855 region:rollup2
KNOW THAT THERE HAS BEEN A LOT

00:44:49.287 --> 00:44:53.324 region:rollup2
OF EFFORT AND INTEREST ON THEIR

00:44:50.855 --> 00:44:55.293 region:rollup2
PART. I'M FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH.

00:44:53.324 --> 00:44:57.461 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS WHICH COULD SPAN THE

00:44:55.293 --> 00:44:59.096 region:rollup2
SPECTRUM OF ALL KINDS OF AND

00:44:57.461 --> 00:45:00.965 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TYPES OF THINGS. WE

00:44:59.096 --> 00:45:02.633 region:rollup2
WORK AND WE CERTIFY THE

00:45:00.965 --> 00:45:03.801 region:rollup2
ORGANIZATIONS

00:45:02.633 --> 00:45:05.403 region:rollup2
TWO CERTIFYING ORGANIZATIONS

00:45:03.801 --> 00:45:06.604 region:rollup2
WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT THAT

00:45:05.403 --> 00:45:07.104 region:rollup2
CERTIFIED DRUG AND ALCOHOL

00:45:06.604 --> 00:45:09.040 region:rollup2
COUNSELLORS THEY'RE NOT

00:45:07.104 --> 00:45:10.708 region:rollup2
LICENSED.

00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:13.110 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE PER SE BUT THEY

00:45:10.708 --> 00:45:14.946 region:rollup2
ARE CERTIFIED AND WE OVERSEE THE

00:45:13.110 --> 00:45:16.881 region:rollup2
CERTIFYING BODIES THEMSELVES.

00:45:14.946 --> 00:45:18.816 region:rollup2
TAKING A STEP BACK FROM ALL OF

00:45:16.881 --> 00:45:21.018 region:rollup2
THAT I THINK THAT WE.

00:45:18.816 --> 00:45:21.285 region:rollup2
HAVE ALWAYS ACKNOWLEDGED THAT

00:45:21.018 --> 00:45:22.587 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T.

00:45:21.285 --> 00:45:24.722 region:rollup2
.

00:45:22.587 --> 00:45:26.724 region:rollup2
YOU CAN'T LIMIT THE NUMBER OF

00:45:24.722 --> 00:45:28.559 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND IN THIS PARTICULAR

00:45:26.724 --> 00:45:29.694 region:rollup2
AREA TO SPECIALTY PROVIDERS AND

00:45:28.559 --> 00:45:31.195 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE BEEN TRYING REALLY

00:45:29.694 --> 00:45:33.197 region:rollup2
HARD TO GROW.

00:45:31.195 --> 00:45:34.999 region:rollup2
THE COMFORT LEVEL OF PRIMARY

00:45:33.197 --> 00:45:36.200 region:rollup2
CARE PHYSICIANS IN PARTICULAR.

00:45:34.999 --> 00:45:37.568 region:rollup2
AND THAT WOULD SPAN FROM

00:45:36.200 --> 00:45:39.437 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE PHYSICIANS TO NURSE

00:45:37.568 --> 00:45:41.105 region:rollup2
PRACTITIONERS AND OTHERS AND SO

00:45:39.437 --> 00:45:42.940 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AN INITIATIVE UNDER WAY

00:45:41.105 --> 00:45:44.342 region:rollup2
THAT'S USING FEDERAL MONEY.

00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:45.910 region:rollup2
CALLED THE HUB AND SPOKE

00:45:44.342 --> 00:45:47.445 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND SO WE HAVE.

00:45:45.910 --> 00:45:49.480 region:rollup2
NINETY MILLION DOLLARS OVER TWO

00:45:47.445 --> 00:45:51.916 region:rollup2
YEARS AND FEDERAL FUNDING WHERE

00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:52.950 region:rollup2
THE THE HUB IS A SPECIALIZED

00:45:51.916 --> 00:45:54.318 region:rollup2
PROVIDER LIKE A NARCOTIC

00:45:52.950 --> 00:45:56.354 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PROVIDER AND THE

00:45:54.318 --> 00:45:58.256 region:rollup2
SPOKES ARE PRIMARY CARE.

00:45:56.354 --> 00:45:59.423 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS AND OR CLINICS OUT IN

00:45:58.256 --> 00:46:02.360 region:rollup2
THE COMMUNITY AND REALLY WHAT

00:45:59.423 --> 00:46:03.928 region:rollup2
THE INTENT IS TO GROW THAT WORK

00:46:02.360 --> 00:46:06.430 region:rollup2
FORCE COMFORT AND.

00:46:03.928 --> 00:46:08.633 region:rollup2
THE AND GROW THE PIPELINE AND

00:46:06.430 --> 00:46:10.201 region:rollup2
CAPACITY BECAUSE IF INDIVIDUALS

00:46:08.633 --> 00:46:11.702 region:rollup2
HAVE A SUBSTANCE USE PROBLEM.

00:46:10.201 --> 00:46:12.737 region:rollup2
WHAT HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN THE

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.371 region:rollup2
RESPONSE FROM A PRIMARY CARE

00:46:12.737 --> 00:46:15.306 region:rollup2
PROVIDER IS IS?

00:46:13.371 --> 00:46:16.440 region:rollup2
I'M GONNA HAND YOU OFF TO

00:46:15.306 --> 00:46:17.942 region:rollup2
SOMEONE ELSE WHO HAS A SPECIALTY

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:20.011 region:rollup2
AND SUBSTANCE USE TREATMENT AND

00:46:17.942 --> 00:46:21.545 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT WE. ALL KNOW THAT

00:46:20.011 --> 00:46:23.247 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST SIMPLY NOT POSSIBLE

00:46:21.545 --> 00:46:25.383 region:rollup2
GIVEN THEN NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS

00:46:23.247 --> 00:46:25.916 region:rollup2
THAT STRUGGLE WITH THIS DISEASE

00:46:25.383 --> 00:46:27.918 region:rollup2
AND SO.

00:46:25.916 --> 00:46:29.320 region:rollup2
A LOT OF WORK BETWEEN OSP HEAD

00:46:27.918 --> 00:46:31.222 region:rollup2
AND WITH OUR FEDERAL GRANT HAS

00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.024 region:rollup2
BEEN AROUND ON INCREASING THE

00:46:31.222 --> 00:46:34.191 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AND AVAILABILITY OF

00:46:33.024 --> 00:46:35.893 region:rollup2
THOSE PROVIDERS.

00:46:34.191 --> 00:46:36.527 region:rollup2
THELAST THING I KNOW IS THAT

00:46:35.893 --> 00:46:38.296 region:rollup2
THERE'S CERTAINLY BEEN AN EYE

00:46:36.527 --> 00:46:40.097 region:rollup2
FOR AN INTEREST IN AND

00:46:38.296 --> 00:46:41.365 region:rollup2
DEVELOPING PEER. SUPPORT

00:46:40.097 --> 00:46:42.733 region:rollup2
SPECIALISTS IN THE LEGISLATURE I

00:46:41.365 --> 00:46:43.734 region:rollup2
THINK THERE'S SOME LEGISLATION

00:46:42.733 --> 00:46:45.002 region:rollup2
THAT IS PENDING THIS YEAR THERE

00:46:43.734 --> 00:46:46.504 region:rollup2
WERE SOME AND A COUPLE OF

00:46:45.002 --> 00:46:48.639 region:rollup2
PREVIOUS YEARS AGO WHERE.

00:46:46.504 --> 00:46:50.174 region:rollup2
IT'S SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO

00:46:48.639 --> 00:46:52.143 region:rollup2
PERMITS PHOTOS IN TERMS OF YOU

00:46:50.174 --> 00:46:54.945 region:rollup2
HAVE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE THE

00:46:52.143 --> 00:46:56.347 region:rollup2
LIVED EXPERIENCE OF ON THEIR OWN

00:46:54.945 --> 00:46:58.049 region:rollup2
STRUGGLES WITH ADDICTION AND

00:46:56.347 --> 00:46:59.850 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH OTHER INDIVIDUALS

00:46:58.049 --> 00:47:01.085 region:rollup2
THAT ARE UNDERGOING A SIMILAR.

00:46:59.850 --> 00:47:03.087 region:rollup2
PROCESS AND SO WE'VE BEEN I'M

00:47:01.085 --> 00:47:04.221 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT HOW WOULD THAT BE.

00:47:03.087 --> 00:47:05.189 region:rollup2
BOTH DEVELOPED FROM A

00:47:04.221 --> 00:47:07.024 region:rollup2
CURRICULUM AND OVERSIGHT

00:47:05.189 --> 00:47:08.626 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON THE FUNDING IS

00:47:07.024 --> 00:47:11.462 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT.

00:47:08.626 --> 00:47:12.029 region:rollup2
HILL TO GET OVER BUT I THINK

00:47:11.462 --> 00:47:13.864 region:rollup2
THAT ALL KIND OF GHOST YOUR

00:47:12.029 --> 00:47:15.966 region:rollup2
LARGER QUESTION WHICH IS WE

00:47:13.864 --> 00:47:16.934 region:rollup2
THINK THAT WE NEED MORE CAPACITY

00:47:15.966 --> 00:47:19.003 region:rollup2
IN THE STATE AND THERE'S A.

00:47:16.934 --> 00:47:20.004 region:rollup2
BUNCH OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES

00:47:19.003 --> 00:47:23.240 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GEARED TOWARDS THAT.

00:47:20.004 --> 00:47:24.742 region:rollup2
IS PRIMARY CARE THE ONLY AVENUE

00:47:23.240 --> 00:47:27.111 region:rollup2
WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT TO

00:47:24.742 --> 00:47:27.678 region:rollup2
TACKLE THIS COMPLEX PROBLEM.

00:47:27.111 --> 00:47:29.747 region:rollup2
IT SEEMS THAT OUR SAFETY NET

00:47:27.678 --> 00:47:32.616 region:rollup2
HAS.

00:47:29.747 --> 00:47:35.119 region:rollup2
A MULTITUDE OF ENTRY POINTS AND

00:47:32.616 --> 00:47:36.854 region:rollup2
I'M JUST REFLECTING BACK ON MY

00:47:35.119 --> 00:47:38.923 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE IN THE ER.

00:47:36.854 --> 00:47:40.958 region:rollup2
AND HOW MANY PEOPLE I SAW WHO

00:47:38.923 --> 00:47:43.361 region:rollup2
CAME TO SEE ME. I WONDER IF

00:47:40.958 --> 00:47:45.663 region:rollup2
THERE'S A PLACE TO DISCUSS

00:47:43.361 --> 00:47:47.565 region:rollup2
DETOXING IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM.

00:47:45.663 --> 00:47:49.200 region:rollup2
ONLY BECAUSE YOU'RE MORE

00:47:47.565 --> 00:47:50.668 region:rollup2
SUPERVISED.

00:47:49.200 --> 00:47:52.970 region:rollup2
YOU'RE ACTUALLY CONNECTED TO

00:47:50.668 --> 00:47:55.306 region:rollup2
EQUIPMENT YOU HAVE THE

00:47:52.970 --> 00:47:58.008 region:rollup2
AVAILABILITY TO DO THE.

00:47:55.306 --> 00:47:59.977 region:rollup2
MORE INTENSE DETOXIFICATION THIS

00:47:58.008 --> 00:48:02.079 region:rollup2
THAT CAN OCCUR IN I'M JUST

00:47:59.977 --> 00:48:04.381 region:rollup2
TRYING TO WAY THROUGH. IF IT'S

00:48:02.079 --> 00:48:06.016 region:rollup2
ONLY PRIMARY CARE THAT WERE

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:08.419 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON OR OFF WERE CAPABLE

00:48:06.016 --> 00:48:10.121 region:rollup2
OF. HAVING A DISCUSSION ABOUT

00:48:08.419 --> 00:48:10.554 region:rollup2
THE MULTITUDE OF AREAS I MEAN I

00:48:10.121 --> 00:48:12.757 region:rollup2
THINK.

00:48:10.554 --> 00:48:14.458 region:rollup2
IT COMES IN A MULTITUDE OF

00:48:12.757 --> 00:48:16.093 region:rollup2
VARIOUS RIGHTS OF THE VOLUNTARY

00:48:14.458 --> 00:48:17.328 region:rollup2
INPATIENT DETOX BENEFIT.

00:48:16.093 --> 00:48:18.796 region:rollup2
.

00:48:17.328 --> 00:48:20.664 region:rollup2
AS US THE BEACH DAY PREVIOUSLY

00:48:18.796 --> 00:48:22.633 region:rollup2
NOTED WAS A BENEFIT THAT WE

00:48:20.664 --> 00:48:24.869 region:rollup2
ADDED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN ON IT

00:48:22.633 --> 00:48:27.304 region:rollup2
IS ONLY IN A HOSPITAL SETTING.

00:48:24.869 --> 00:48:28.305 region:rollup2
DUE TO A LOT OF REASONS AT THE

00:48:27.304 --> 00:48:29.640 region:rollup2
TIME WE DIDN'T HAVE AN AYE ANDY

00:48:28.305 --> 00:48:31.208 region:rollup2
WAIVER BECAUSE WE HADN'T GOTTEN

00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:33.577 region:rollup2
ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER. ON

00:48:31.208 --> 00:48:35.846 region:rollup2
MEDICAID HISTORICALLY HAS A THE.

00:48:33.577 --> 00:48:37.248 region:rollup2
A BIAS TOWARDS IT THEY CALLED

00:48:35.846 --> 00:48:38.816 region:rollup2
AN INSTITUTIONAL BIAS RIGHT

00:48:37.248 --> 00:48:40.184 region:rollup2
MEDICAID PROGRAMS IN THIS IS NOT

00:48:38.816 --> 00:48:42.419 region:rollup2
JUST CALIFORNIA BUT NATIONALLY.

00:48:40.184 --> 00:48:44.722 region:rollup2
MEDICAID FUNDS INSTITUTIONAL

00:48:42.419 --> 00:48:46.590 region:rollup2
CARE THEY DON'T FUND RESIDENTIAL

00:48:44.722 --> 00:48:47.525 region:rollup2
OR LOWER LEVELS OF CARE AND SO

00:48:46.590 --> 00:48:48.793 region:rollup2
WOULD NOT BENEFIT WAS

00:48:47.525 --> 00:48:50.261 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCTED IN TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:48:48.793 --> 00:48:51.629 region:rollup2
IT WAS DONE KIND OF IN THE

00:48:50.261 --> 00:48:54.365 region:rollup2
MINDSET OF WHAT WAS ALLOWED AT

00:48:51.629 --> 00:48:56.300 region:rollup2
THE. UNDER THE FEDERAL GUIDANCE.

00:48:54.365 --> 00:48:58.235 region:rollup2
THAT BEING SAID I THINK THAT.

00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:59.470 region:rollup2
.

00:48:58.235 --> 00:49:01.038 region:rollup2
THE ONLY THING I WOULD WANT TO

00:48:59.470 --> 00:49:03.107 region:rollup2
SAY ABOUT EMERGENCY ROOMS IS THE

00:49:01.038 --> 00:49:04.975 region:rollup2
CAPACITY FOR OTHER TYPES OF BEDS

00:49:03.107 --> 00:49:06.610 region:rollup2
RATE AND OBVIOUSLY WITH THE

00:49:04.975 --> 00:49:09.413 region:rollup2
SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS.

00:49:06.610 --> 00:49:10.347 region:rollup2
AND SOME OF THE INDIVIDUALS

00:49:09.413 --> 00:49:13.384 region:rollup2
THAT COME INTO EMERGENCY ROOMS

00:49:10.347 --> 00:49:15.452 region:rollup2
AND A AND A SERIOUS CASE THERE

00:49:13.384 --> 00:49:16.921 region:rollup2
YOU WOULDN'T WANNA. THERE'S A

00:49:15.452 --> 00:49:18.589 region:rollup2
REALLY LIMITED THAT CAPACITY.

00:49:16.921 --> 00:49:19.990 region:rollup2
THE LAST THING I'LL SAY AND I

00:49:18.589 --> 00:49:21.625 region:rollup2
THINK THAT COMMITTEE HEARD THIS

00:49:19.990 --> 00:49:23.561 region:rollup2
LAST WEEK.

00:49:21.625 --> 00:49:25.663 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF SENATOR MITCHELL'S

00:49:23.561 --> 00:49:27.231 region:rollup2
BILL AND TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:49:25.663 --> 00:49:28.532 region:rollup2
ALLOWANCE FOR SUBSTANCE USE

00:49:27.231 --> 00:49:29.967 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AND.

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:31.836 region:rollup2
SPECIAL TO IN A WHOLE SERVICES

00:49:29.967 --> 00:49:33.504 region:rollup2
AN FQHC SETTINGS AND HOW WE'RE

00:49:31.836 --> 00:49:34.772 region:rollup2
GOING TO DO THE. BOTH THE

00:49:33.504 --> 00:49:36.340 region:rollup2
BILLION AND THE PAYMENT

00:49:34.772 --> 00:49:37.741 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT I THINK

00:49:36.340 --> 00:49:38.209 region:rollup2
THAT THERE'S ELEVEN HUNDRED

00:49:37.741 --> 00:49:40.010 region:rollup2
FQHCS IN THE STATE OF

00:49:38.209 --> 00:49:42.146 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA.

00:49:40.010 --> 00:49:45.516 region:rollup2
CRITICAL BACKBONE OF PROVIDER

00:49:42.146 --> 00:49:46.317 region:rollup2
SUPPORTER AND CAPACITY AND SO.

00:49:45.516 --> 00:49:47.451 region:rollup2
IT THERE'S A HOT BUT THERE'S A

00:49:46.317 --> 00:49:48.719 region:rollup2
ROLE FOR HOSPITALS THERE'S A

00:49:47.451 --> 00:49:50.821 region:rollup2
ROLE FOR CLINICS THERE'S A ROLE

00:49:48.719 --> 00:49:52.523 region:rollup2
FOR PRIVATE PROVIDERS THERE'S A

00:49:50.821 --> 00:49:54.258 region:rollup2
ROLE FOR PEER SUPPORT ANY. THERE

00:49:52.523 --> 00:49:55.793 region:rollup2
IS A FULL KIND OF COMPLEMENT OF

00:49:54.258 --> 00:49:56.961 region:rollup2
BOTH SERVICES AND CAPACITY THAT

00:49:55.793 --> 00:49:59.830 region:rollup2
WE AS A DEPARTMENT THAT MORE

00:49:56.961 --> 00:50:01.232 region:rollup2
BROADLY ARE YOU KNOW ALL KINDS.

00:49:59.830 --> 00:50:03.667 region:rollup2
PITCHING AND ON DIFFERENT

00:50:01.232 --> 00:50:04.535 region:rollup2
ASPECTS OF IT CAN YOU TALK A

00:50:03.667 --> 00:50:05.469 region:rollup2
LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT S. BIRD.

00:50:04.535 --> 00:50:06.270 region:rollup2
.

00:50:05.469 --> 00:50:07.738 region:rollup2
AND.

00:50:06.270 --> 00:50:09.473 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE QUESTIONS WE HAD ON

00:50:07.738 --> 00:50:12.643 region:rollup2
OUR AGENDA WAS IS IT ONLY

00:50:09.473 --> 00:50:14.144 region:rollup2
REIMBURSABLE AND PRIMARY CARE

00:50:12.643 --> 00:50:16.947 region:rollup2
SAID SON I'M TRYING TO.

00:50:14.144 --> 00:50:18.816 region:rollup2
PUSH AGAIN ON PRESS ANGLED BUT.

00:50:16.947 --> 00:50:19.984 region:rollup2
CAN YOU ELABORATE ON WHAT WE

00:50:18.816 --> 00:50:22.286 region:rollup2
HEARD THAT IT'S ONLY ALCOHOL

00:50:19.984 --> 00:50:24.521 region:rollup2
SURE IS IT POSSIBLE FOR US TO

00:50:22.286 --> 00:50:26.524 region:rollup2
CONSIDER WHAT. WOULD HAPPEN IF

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:28.526 region:rollup2
WE WANTED TO EXPAND ITS OR TO

00:50:26.524 --> 00:50:29.927 region:rollup2
INCREASE THE SCOPE SURE. SO.

00:50:28.526 --> 00:50:32.129 region:rollup2
.

00:50:29.927 --> 00:50:33.330 region:rollup2
STEPPING BACKTO TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:50:32.129 --> 00:50:35.165 region:rollup2
WHEN I SAID THAT WE HAD A COUPLE

00:50:33.330 --> 00:50:35.799 region:rollup2
OF BENEFITS WE HAD TO ADD AS A

00:50:35.165 --> 00:50:37.701 region:rollup2
AS A.

00:50:35.799 --> 00:50:39.003 region:rollup2
TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:41.672 region:rollup2
THE ESSENTIAL HEALTH BENEFITS

00:50:39.003 --> 00:50:42.973 region:rollup2
ASPER WAS ONE OF THEM. AND I CAN

00:50:41.672 --> 00:50:45.309 region:rollup2
GET BACK TO YOUR STAFF TO

00:50:42.973 --> 00:50:47.811 region:rollup2
CONFIRM THIS BUT WHEN WE ADOPTED

00:50:45.309 --> 00:50:49.213 region:rollup2
THAT PARTICULAR BENEFIT IT WAS

00:50:47.811 --> 00:50:51.348 region:rollup2
USING THE U. S. PREVENTATIVE.

00:50:49.213 --> 00:50:52.783 region:rollup2
SERVICES TASK FORCE

00:50:51.348 --> 00:50:54.451 region:rollup2
RECOMMENDATIONS SO THEY HAVE A

00:50:52.783 --> 00:50:56.020 region:rollup2
IN BE RECOMMENDATIONS AND SO I

00:50:54.451 --> 00:50:57.388 region:rollup2
THINK WE TOOK WHAT AT THE TIME

00:50:56.020 --> 00:50:59.757 region:rollup2
WAS THE U. S. PREVENTIVE TASK

00:50:57.388 --> 00:51:01.792 region:rollup2
FORCE RECOMMENDATION WHICH WAS

00:50:59.757 --> 00:51:04.028 region:rollup2
PRIMARY CARE SETTING. ALCOHOL

00:51:01.792 --> 00:51:05.763 region:rollup2
AND I THINK THAT IT IS POSSIBLE

00:51:04.028 --> 00:51:07.398 region:rollup2
TO ADD EITHER ADDITIONAL

00:51:05.763 --> 00:51:08.666 region:rollup2
LOCATIONS.

00:51:07.398 --> 00:51:11.268 region:rollup2
OR ADDITIONAL.

00:51:08.666 --> 00:51:13.037 region:rollup2
EITHER ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS

00:51:11.268 --> 00:51:13.971 region:rollup2
IT JUST GETS INTO THAT'S JUST A

00:51:13.037 --> 00:51:15.372 region:rollup2
FISCAL THING WHICH IS

00:51:13.971 --> 00:51:17.107 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE FOR THIS KIND OF

00:51:15.372 --> 00:51:17.675 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER WHETHER

00:51:17.107 --> 00:51:19.944 region:rollup2
YOU WANTED TO EXPAND THAT.

00:51:17.675 --> 00:51:21.845 region:rollup2
.

00:51:19.944 --> 00:51:24.048 region:rollup2
SO WAS THAT DECISION THAT AGAIN

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:25.916 region:rollup2
SHOWS ONLY PRIMARY CARE AND

00:51:24.048 --> 00:51:28.052 region:rollup2
ALCOHOL TRACK AND YOU SAID THERE

00:51:25.916 --> 00:51:29.954 region:rollup2
WERE A AND B..

00:51:28.052 --> 00:51:30.487 region:rollup2
UP I GUESS ALL FOLLOW UP AT A

00:51:29.954 --> 00:51:33.757 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT TIME IF I CAN.

00:51:30.487 --> 00:51:35.092 region:rollup2
.

00:51:33.757 --> 00:51:36.660 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO TRANSITION IF I

00:51:35.092 --> 00:51:39.897 region:rollup2
COULD TO COUNTY OF SERVICE

00:51:36.660 --> 00:51:41.899 region:rollup2
RECESS COUNTY OF RESPONSIBILITY.

00:51:39.897 --> 00:51:42.533 region:rollup2
MAYBE IT WAS BECAUSE ALSO STILL

00:51:41.899 --> 00:51:42.700 region:rollup2
COUNTY LINE.

00:51:42.533 --> 00:51:44.835 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.569 region:rollup2
.

00:51:44.835 --> 00:51:47.504 region:rollup2
I'VE SEEN THIS ONE TOO MANY

00:51:45.569 --> 00:51:49.340 region:rollup2
TIMES YEAH AND I'M WONDERING IF

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:52.776 region:rollup2
THERE'S A STATEWIDE FIX AND

00:51:49.340 --> 00:51:53.077 region:rollup2
LOOKING FOR. REAL ANSWERS IT. IT

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:55.679 region:rollup2
SEEMS THAT.

00:51:53.077 --> 00:51:56.847 region:rollup2
THE ADVOCATE BEFORE IT SAID

00:51:55.679 --> 00:51:58.682 region:rollup2
THAT THERE WERE THREE THAT THEY

00:51:56.847 --> 00:51:59.984 region:rollup2
PLACED ON THE TABLE. IS THERE

00:51:58.682 --> 00:52:01.752 region:rollup2
SOMETHING AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL

00:51:59.984 --> 00:52:03.354 region:rollup2
THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT SO

00:52:01.752 --> 00:52:05.122 region:rollup2
THAT WE'RE NOT. REINVENTING THE

00:52:03.354 --> 00:52:05.856 region:rollup2
WHEEL EACH TIME A COUNTY IS

00:52:05.122 --> 00:52:07.725 region:rollup2
LOOKING TO TO THE US

00:52:05.856 --> 00:52:09.193 region:rollup2
SURE SO ASSEMBLY BILL TWELVE

00:52:07.725 --> 00:52:09.760 region:rollup2
NINETY NINE BY A FORMER

00:52:09.193 --> 00:52:11.095 region:rollup2
ASSEMBLYMEMBER RIDLEY THOMAS

00:52:09.760 --> 00:52:13.163 region:rollup2
WAS.

00:52:11.095 --> 00:52:14.932 region:rollup2
.

00:52:13.163 --> 00:52:17.267 region:rollup2
SUPPOSED TO BE THAT FIX.

00:52:14.932 --> 00:52:19.536 region:rollup2
I THINK IT WAS MULTI YEARS IN

00:52:17.267 --> 00:52:21.105 region:rollup2
THE NEGOTIATING I THINK IT IS

00:52:19.536 --> 00:52:24.775 region:rollup2
STILL FAIRLY NEW I BELIEVE IT

00:52:21.105 --> 00:52:26.844 region:rollup2
WAS SCIENCE TWO SESSIONS AGO.

00:52:24.775 --> 00:52:28.579 region:rollup2
BECAME.

00:52:26.844 --> 00:52:30.848 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE MAYBE A YEAR A YEAR

PREVIOUS JANUARY.

00:52:31.782 --> 00:52:34.852 region:rollup2
.

00:52:33.917 --> 00:52:35.919 region:rollup2
THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS THERE'S

00:52:34.852 --> 00:52:37.388 region:rollup2
THE AB TWELVE NINETY NINE

00:52:35.919 --> 00:52:40.724 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTATION WHICH ESSENTIALLY

00:52:37.388 --> 00:52:42.359 region:rollup2
SAYS WHENEVER AND. RECEIVES

00:52:40.724 --> 00:52:45.462 region:rollup2
SERVICES AND COUNTY IT IS THAT

00:52:42.359 --> 00:52:47.031 region:rollup2
COUNTIES RESPONSIBILITY TO.

PAY FOR THOSE SERVICES.

00:52:47.031 --> 00:52:51.635 region:rollup2
AND I'M SIMPLIFYING IT VISITS

00:52:49.133 --> 00:52:52.803 region:rollup2
COMPLICATED AND THERE'S ALSO THE

00:52:51.635 --> 00:52:54.571 region:rollup2
INTERACTION WITH COUNTY

00:52:52.803 --> 00:52:56.273 region:rollup2

A BIG DISCUSSION ITEM AND SO WE

00:55:05.669 --> 00:55:08.772 region:rollup2

CHILD WELFARE SIDE. AS WELL AS

00:55:11.041 --> 00:55:13.844 region:rollup2
ON THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SIDE

00:55:12.276 --> 00:55:15.012 region:rollup2
ABOUT THOSE FISCAL

00:55:13.844 --> 00:55:15.712 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITIES.

00:55:15.012 --> 00:55:18.282 region:rollup2
THE SAME.

00:55:15.712 --> 00:55:20.651 region:rollup2
KIND OF TENSION APPLIES ON THE

00:55:18.282 --> 00:55:21.718 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE YOU SIDE AND SO I'M

00:55:20.651 --> 00:55:23.053 region:rollup2
SITTING IN BOTH CONVERSATIONS

00:55:21.718 --> 00:55:24.955 region:rollup2
AND I'M NOT SURE THAT WE.

00:55:23.053 --> 00:55:26.490 region:rollup2
COLLECTIVELY HAVE A.

00:55:24.955 --> 00:55:27.858 region:rollup2
I THOUGHT AROUND STATUTORY

00:55:26.490 --> 00:55:29.159 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS BUT CERTAINLY TO

00:55:27.858 --> 00:55:30.928 region:rollup2
THE EXTENT THAT WE IDENTIFY

00:55:29.159 --> 00:55:34.164 region:rollup2
SOMETHING THAT WOULD MAKE THAT.

00:55:30.928 --> 00:55:35.966 region:rollup2
MORE AND NIMBLE IN TERMS OF HOW

00:55:34.164 --> 00:55:38.268 region:rollup2
THOSE FUNDS GET EITHER. RELEASE

00:55:35.966 --> 00:55:39.770 region:rollup2
DISTRIBUTED OR HOW CONTRACTING

00:55:38.268 --> 00:55:41.705 region:rollup2
CAN BE BETTER DONE I THINK.

00:55:39.770 --> 00:55:43.140 region:rollup2
WE WOULD CERTAINLY COME BACK TO

00:55:41.705 --> 00:55:45.008 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATURE ON THE.

00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:47.778 region:rollup2

00:55:47.778 --> 00:55:52.082 region:rollup2
WELL THAT WAS MY.

00:55:49.413 --> 00:55:52.683 region:rollup2
OKAY SOME.

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.684 region:rollup2
MY FINAL QUESTION IF I CAN AND

00:55:52.683 --> 00:55:55.485 region:rollup2
I.

00:55:53.684 --> 00:55:57.020 region:rollup2
.

00:55:55.485 --> 00:55:59.489 region:rollup2
ALWAYS TALK ABOUT OUTCOMES BUT

00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:00.991 region:rollup2
REALLY I'M TRYING TO. FIGURE OUT

00:55:59.489 --> 00:56:04.294 region:rollup2
WHAT IS IT THAT WE'RE DRIVING

00:56:00.991 --> 00:56:06.063 region:rollup2
FOR WITH OUR. CURRENT STATE PLAN

00:56:04.294 --> 00:56:09.199 region:rollup2
WHICH OUTCOMES ARE METRICS ARE

00:56:06.063 --> 00:56:11.001 region:rollup2
WE. WORKING ON IN RELATIONS TO

00:56:09.199 --> 00:56:12.336 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCE ABUSE THAT ARE MAKING

00:56:11.001 --> 00:56:14.304 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCES AND.

00:56:12.336 --> 00:56:15.973 region:rollup2
OUR WE TRACKING ALMOND AND WHEN

00:56:14.304 --> 00:56:17.541 region:rollup2
DO WE EXPECT OUR FIRST DATA

00:56:15.973 --> 00:56:19.776 region:rollup2
POINTS BACK YEAH GREAT QUESTION.

00:56:17.541 --> 00:56:22.379 region:rollup2
SO THE COUNTIES THAT ARE.

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:24.214 region:rollup2
DISSIPATING IN THE ELEVEN

00:56:22.379 --> 00:56:26.850 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN WAIVER AS A CONDITION

00:56:24.214 --> 00:56:28.018 region:rollup2
FOR THE FEDERAL FUNDS AND FOR

00:56:26.850 --> 00:56:29.519 region:rollup2
BEING A WAIVER WE HAVE TO DO AN

00:56:28.018 --> 00:56:31.722 region:rollup2
EVALUATION. SO.

00:56:29.519 --> 00:56:33.056 region:rollup2
UCLA IS OUR.

00:56:31.722 --> 00:56:35.626 region:rollup2
DESIGNATED.

00:56:33.056 --> 00:56:36.226 region:rollup2
ENTITY THAT WILL BE DOING THAT

00:56:35.626 --> 00:56:38.462 region:rollup2
OUTSIDE INDEPENDENT

00:56:36.226 --> 00:56:39.997 region:rollup2
EVALUATION SAID THEY HAVE BEEN.

00:56:38.462 --> 00:56:41.932 region:rollup2
BOTH RECEIVING AND GETTING DATA

00:56:39.997 --> 00:56:42.733 region:rollup2
FROM THE OUTSIDE AND I THINK

00:56:41.932 --> 00:56:43.634 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING TO BE INTERESTING

00:56:42.733 --> 00:56:46.637 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF.

00:56:43.634 --> 00:56:47.771 region:rollup2
DOES THIS EXPERIMENT WORK IS WE

00:56:46.637 --> 00:56:50.207 region:rollup2
HAVE A REALLY GOOD.

00:56:47.771 --> 00:56:50.841 region:rollup2
TEST CASE IN CALIFORNIA NOW

00:56:50.207 --> 00:56:51.975 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE HAVE COUNTIES THAT

00:56:50.841 --> 00:56:53.543 region:rollup2
ARE IMPLEMENTING IT VERSUS

00:56:51.975 --> 00:56:57.547 region:rollup2
COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT.

00:56:53.543 --> 00:56:57.748 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE USING THE.

00:56:57.547 --> 00:56:59.616 region:rollup2
THAT.

00:56:57.748 --> 00:57:00.984 region:rollup2
KEPT.

00:56:59.616 --> 00:57:02.686 region:rollup2
BENEFICIARIES THAT ARE IN THE

00:57:00.984 --> 00:57:04.588 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WHERE THE WEAVER EXISTS

00:57:02.686 --> 00:57:06.223 region:rollup2
HAVE THE ABILITY TO ACCESS THOSE

00:57:04.588 --> 00:57:07.991 region:rollup2
SERVICES IT IS A CASE IT IS

00:57:06.223 --> 00:57:09.860 region:rollup2
LIMITED TO THE RESIDENTS OF THAT

00:57:07.991 --> 00:57:10.694 region:rollup2
COUNTY SO IF YOU ARE AND. I'M

00:57:09.860 --> 00:57:12.996 region:rollup2
FOR SAY.

00:57:10.694 --> 00:57:14.631 region:rollup2
ORANGE COUNTY AND YOU WANT TO

00:57:12.996 --> 00:57:17.234 region:rollup2
PARTICIPATE IN LA COUNTY'S

00:57:14.631 --> 00:57:18.602 region:rollup2
WAIVER IT'S LIMITED ONLY TO THE.

00:57:17.234 --> 00:57:19.870 region:rollup2
RESIDENTS WITHIN THAT COUNTY IF.

00:57:18.602 --> 00:57:20.404 region:rollup2
SERVICE AND THAT'S THAT WAS

00:57:19.870 --> 00:57:22.272 region:rollup2
VERY MUCH.

00:57:20.404 --> 00:57:24.007 region:rollup2
SPECIFIC TO THE FEDERAL TERMS

00:57:22.272 --> 00:57:25.742 region:rollup2
AND CONDITIONS OF THE WAIVER.

00:57:24.007 --> 00:57:27.411 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT ON SOME OF THE

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:28.879 region:rollup2
DATA THAT WE ARE ABLE TO SEE IN

00:57:27.411 --> 00:57:30.147 region:rollup2
THERE IN TERMS OF.

00:57:28.879 --> 00:57:33.116 region:rollup2
POSITIVE OUTCOMES.

00:57:30.147 --> 00:57:35.385 region:rollup2
REDUCTION IN UTILIZATION OF E.

00:57:33.116 --> 00:57:36.119 region:rollup2
R. I'M CERTAINLY WE ARE TRACKING

00:57:35.385 --> 00:57:37.921 region:rollup2
CLOSELY AND.

00:57:36.119 --> 00:57:39.656 region:rollup2
YOU'LL PROBABLY HEAR FROM

00:57:37.921 --> 00:57:41.792 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH

00:57:39.656 --> 00:57:42.793 region:rollup2
LATER AND I I LIKE TO GIVE THEM

00:57:41.792 --> 00:57:45.662 region:rollup2
PROPS ON THEIR APPEAL A

00:57:42.793 --> 00:57:47.130 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD. SO WERE ALSO YOU KNOW

00:57:45.662 --> 00:57:49.966 region:rollup2
AS A STATE INTERESTED IN.

00:57:47.130 --> 00:57:51.335 region:rollup2
EITHER THE. OVERDOSE OR DEATH

00:57:49.966 --> 00:57:53.136 region:rollup2
RATES ASSOCIATED WITH OPIOIDS

00:57:51.335 --> 00:57:55.305 region:rollup2
THE REALLY KEY INDICATOR WE

00:57:53.136 --> 00:57:56.707 region:rollup2
OVERSEE THE AND DO YOU AYE

00:57:55.305 --> 00:57:58.508 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS IN THE STATE SO WE'RE

00:57:56.707 --> 00:57:59.509 region:rollup2
ALSO LOOKING AT OBVIOUSLY RATES

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.844 region:rollup2
OF.

00:57:59.509 --> 00:58:02.346 region:rollup2
ARREST LATE IN A BECAUSE OF

00:58:00.844 --> 00:58:04.581 region:rollup2
IMPAIRED DRIVING SO THERE'S A

00:58:02.346 --> 00:58:06.550 region:rollup2
LOT OF DIFFERENT METRICS THAT WE

00:58:04.581 --> 00:58:09.019 region:rollup2
USE ARE THEY ALL KIND OF ROLLED

00:58:06.550 --> 00:58:09.753 region:rollup2
UP INTO ONE NEEDS. DASHBOARD

00:58:09.019 --> 00:58:11.088 region:rollup2
PROBABLY NOT THE OPIOID

00:58:09.753 --> 00:58:12.055 region:rollup2
DASHBOARD IS ONE THAT I THINK IS

00:58:11.088 --> 00:58:14.691 region:rollup2
REALLY GOOD BUT THE.

00:58:12.055 --> 00:58:15.759 region:rollup2
EVALUATION HAS BEEN SUBMITTED

00:58:14.691 --> 00:58:17.594 region:rollup2

AS WELL AS BECAUSE THAT'S

00:58:20.330 --> 00:58:24.267 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO GETTING. CONTINUED

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:26.503 region:rollup2
SUPPORT FOR THOSE FUNDS IS

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:26.903 region:rollup2
SHOWING THAT IT ACTUALLY WORKS.

00:58:26.503 --> 00:58:27.904 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHO RUBIO.

.

00:58:27.904 --> 00:58:31.308 region:rollup2
THIS IS ALL ABOUT FUNDING.

00:58:29.973 --> 00:58:32.175 region:rollup2
WHEN I WALKED IN THAT WE WERE

00:58:31.308 --> 00:58:34.277 region:rollup2
TALKING ABOUT.

00:58:32.175 --> 00:58:36.847 region:rollup2
THE DIFFICULTIES AND AND SOME

00:58:34.277 --> 00:58:38.382 region:rollup2
OF THE OPERATORS BEING PAID CAN

YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHAT

00:58:38.382 --> 00:58:43.487 region:rollup2
THAT THE HOLD UP IS.

00:58:39.883 --> 00:58:44.254 region:rollup2
WHICH.

00:58:43.487 --> 00:58:48.258 region:rollup2
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

00:58:44.254 --> 00:58:52.529 region:rollup2

00:58:48.258 --> 00:58:55.632 region:rollup2
WHICH WHICH WHICH TO SLIP UP

00:58:52.529 --> 00:58:56.266 region:rollup2
PROVIDED COULDN'T.

00:58:55.632 --> 00:58:57.134 region:rollup2
IT WAS JUST ON THE COUNTY OF

THAT'S THE TWELVE NINETY NINE

00:58:59.936 --> 00:59:03.840 region:rollup2
ISSUE THAT I JUST TALKED ABOUT.

00:59:02.205 --> 00:59:05.208 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S KIND OF WHAT

00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:06.977 region:rollup2
THAT'S JUST WHAT WE WERE JUST

00:59:05.208 --> 00:59:07.611 region:rollup2

MEANTIME WHILE THIS IS HAPPENING

01:00:28.558 --> 01:00:30.794 region:rollup2
THERE'S NOTHING BEING DONE AND

01:00:29.693 --> 01:00:31.862 region:rollup2
THEN THERE AND FROM TO MAKE SURE

THAT THESE GUYS SERVICES ARE

01:00:31.862 --> 01:00:34.764 region:rollup2
BEING PAID FOR SOME PEOPLE ARE

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:36.533 region:rollup2
JUST BASICALLY. NOT RECEIVING

01:00:39.669 --> 01:00:45.742 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR WE HAVE BEEN WORKING.

01:00:42.239 --> 01:00:47.043 region:rollup2
WITH THE COUNTIES TO. VALIDATE

01:00:45.742 --> 01:00:48.979 region:rollup2

01:00:52.916 --> 01:00:55.519 region:rollup2
I THINK THAT THAT COUNTIES HAVE

01:00:55.318 --> 01:00:57.621 region:rollup2
ALSO.

01:00:55.519 --> 01:00:59.556 region:rollup2
BEEN HEARING FROM BOTH THE

01:01:08.965 --> 01:01:13.837 region:rollup2
VARYING DEGREES OF.

RECEPTIVITY FROM THE COUNTIES I

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:16.439 region:rollup2
THINK THAT YOU HAVE SOME

01:01:14.371 --> 01:01:17.607 region:rollup2
POLITICAL. ON ISSUE SOMETIMES IN

01:01:16.439 --> 01:01:19.376 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT COUNTIES WERE BOARDS

01:01:17.607 --> 01:01:21.144 region:rollup2

01:01:19.376 --> 01:01:22.979 region:rollup2
WANT TO CONTRACT FOR THE

01:01:21.144 --> 01:01:25.015 region:rollup2
SERVICES I THINK SOME COUNTIES

01:01:22.979 --> 01:01:25.682 region:rollup2
ARE LESS AND SOPHISTICATED IN

01:01:25.015 --> 01:01:27.284 region:rollup2
THEIR CONTRACT IN A PRESS I CAN

01:01:25.682 --> 01:01:28.552 region:rollup2
YOU CAN YOU REPEAT THAT SO THAT

01:01:27.284 --> 01:01:30.287 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT WILLING TO TO

01:01:28.552 --> 01:01:30.854 region:rollup2
CONTRACT FOR THE SERVICES BUT

01:01:30.287 --> 01:01:31.755 region:rollup2
YET THEY WERE RECEIVING THE

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:32.856 region:rollup2
MONEY.

01:01:31.755 --> 01:01:37.227 region:rollup2
SO THEN WHAT'S HAPPENING TO THE

01:01:32.856 --> 01:01:38.528 region:rollup2
MONEY I'M SO THOSE COUNTIES ARE.

01:01:37.227 --> 01:01:40.230 region:rollup2
GOING TO BE PUT UNDER A

01:01:38.528 --> 01:01:41.898 region:rollup2
CORRECTIVE ACTION PLAN BY US

01:01:40.230 --> 01:01:42.899 region:rollup2
WHEN WE WE'VE HAD NUMEROUS

01:01:41.898 --> 01:01:44.301 region:rollup2
CONVERSATIONS WITH ONE

DO THIS AND THEY HAVE.

01:01:46.670 --> 01:01:50.373 region:rollup2
DECLINED AND SO WE'RE GOING TO

01:01:48.972 --> 01:01:52.275 region:rollup2
THERE IS A MECHANISM IN THE LAW

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:53.410 region:rollup2
THAT ALLOWS FOR US TO TAKE THE

01:01:52.275 --> 01:01:55.211 region:rollup2

01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:53.797 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT KIND OF HELP

01:03:51.928 --> 01:03:55.465 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ALONG AND THEN IF IN THIS

01:03:53.797 --> 01:03:55.999 region:rollup2
CASE WE HAVE ONE COUNTY THAT HAS

01:03:55.465 --> 01:03:58.401 region:rollup2
JUST NOT COOPERATED AND SO

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:59.202 region:rollup2
THERE.

01:03:58.401 --> 01:04:00.837 region:rollup2
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE SOMETHING

01:03:59.202 --> 01:04:02.172 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT HAPPENED SO SO IF THE

01:04:00.837 --> 01:04:03.673 region:rollup2
MONEY IS I'VE TAKEN AWAY FROM

01:04:02.172 --> 01:04:05.775 region:rollup2
FROM THE COUNTIES AND THE STATE

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:06.910 region:rollup2
IS BACK TO. WRITING THE SERVICES

01:04:05.775 --> 01:04:08.278 region:rollup2
WE WILL TAKE THE MONEY OUT OF

01:04:06.910 --> 01:04:09.612 region:rollup2
THE COUNTIES ACCOUNT.

01:04:08.278 --> 01:04:11.147 region:rollup2
I MEAN I UNDERSTAND BUT BUT THE

01:04:09.612 --> 01:04:12.482 region:rollup2
SERVICES ARE NOT BEING ARE NOW

01:04:11.147 --> 01:04:14.150 region:rollup2
I'M I'M PRESUMING THAT THAT

01:04:12.482 --> 01:04:18.188 region:rollup2
SERVICES ARE BEING PROVIDED

01:04:14.150 --> 01:04:18.188 region:rollup2
WITHIN THAT COUNTING FROM STIFF

01:04:18.254 --> 01:04:21.057 region:rollup2
FOR WITH THE COUNTY THEY'RE

01:04:19.656 --> 01:04:23.393 region:rollup2
GETTING SERVICES THROUGH

01:04:21.057 --> 01:04:25.261 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS IN OTHER COUNTIES OKAY

01:04:23.393 --> 01:04:26.763 region:rollup2
AND SO THAT IS THE THAT IS THE

01:04:25.261 --> 01:04:28.565 region:rollup2
RUB IS THAT SOME OF THESE

01:04:26.763 --> 01:04:29.399 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS. ARE WE WORRIED THAT

01:04:28.565 --> 01:04:30.867 region:rollup2
THEY'RE NOT GOING TO RECEIVE

01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:33.470 region:rollup2
FUNDING BECAUSE THAT PARTICULAR

01:04:30.867 --> 01:04:35.271 region:rollup2
COUNTY IS NOT WANTING TO. PAY

01:04:33.470 --> 01:04:37.240 region:rollup2
FOR THEM AND SO WE ARE NOT GOING

01:04:35.271 --> 01:04:38.441 region:rollup2
TO LET THAT HAPPEN RIGHT THAT IS

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:39.943 region:rollup2
WHY WE ARE IN THIS SO WE HAVE

01:04:38.441 --> 01:04:41.344 region:rollup2
THE ASSURANCE THAT EVEN.

01:04:39.943 --> 01:04:43.146 region:rollup2
THAT BAD OF FOLKS ARE GETTING

01:04:41.344 --> 01:04:44.013 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AND ABOUT WHETHER THE

01:04:43.146 --> 01:04:45.415 region:rollup2
COUNTY PAYS SOME OF THE STATE

01:04:44.013 --> 01:04:47.283 region:rollup2
PEACE SOMEDAY WE'LL GET PAID FOR

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:49.986 region:rollup2
THOSE SURPRISE. MY BOTTOM LINE

01:04:47.283 --> 01:04:51.554 region:rollup2
SOME BOTH MY STAFF AND OTHERS IS

01:04:49.986 --> 01:04:53.123 region:rollup2
PEOPLE NEED SERVICES THEY ARE.

01:04:51.554 --> 01:04:54.724 region:rollup2
ENTITLED TO THE SERVICES

01:04:53.123 --> 01:04:55.792 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE RUN AN ENTITLEMENT

01:04:54.724 --> 01:04:57.060 region:rollup2
PROGRAM AND SO THEY'RE ENTITLED

01:04:55.792 --> 01:04:59.028 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE WHAT THEY'RE ENTITLED

01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:00.730 region:rollup2
TO RECEIVE. AND WE WILL TAKE

01:04:59.028 --> 01:05:01.664 region:rollup2
CARE OF IT AND THEN IF WE NEED

01:05:00.730 --> 01:05:04.200 region:rollup2
TO BACK OUT MONEY FROM THE

01:05:01.664 --> 01:05:04.801 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ON THE BACK AND THEN

01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:05.135 region:rollup2
WE'LL DO THAT THAT WERE NOT IN

01:05:04.801 --> 01:05:06.870 region:rollup2
THE.

01:05:05.135 --> 01:05:07.871 region:rollup2
BUSINESS OR INTEREST OF HAVING

01:05:06.870 --> 01:05:09.639 region:rollup2
SERVICES GET TONIGHT WHAT AB AND

01:05:07.871 --> 01:05:10.573 region:rollup2
NOW MY CONCERN THOUGH IS THAT IN

01:05:09.639 --> 01:05:12.642 region:rollup2
THE MEANTIME.

01:05:10.573 --> 01:05:12.842 region:rollup2
Y. WHERE YOU KNOW GOING THROUGH

01:05:12.642 --> 01:05:15.078 region:rollup2
THIS.

01:05:12.842 --> 01:05:16.579 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO IT FOLKS HAVE A MAN

01:05:15.078 --> 01:05:18.314 region:rollup2
GETTING. EITHER SERVICES OR

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:20.984 region:rollup2
PROVIDERS HAVE BEEN PAID FOR SIX

01:05:18.314 --> 01:05:22.786 region:rollup2
MONTHS ITSELF I'M A PROVIDER I'M

01:05:20.984 --> 01:05:24.053 region:rollup2
DISCOURAGED I THINK WAS SAID

01:05:22.786 --> 01:05:25.088 region:rollup2
EARLIER I'M DISCOURAGED FROM

01:05:24.053 --> 01:05:26.990 region:rollup2
PROVIDING SERVICES BECAUSE I

01:05:25.088 --> 01:05:27.657 region:rollup2
HAVEN'T GOTTEN PAID. AND THEN IF

01:05:26.990 --> 01:05:30.260 region:rollup2
I'M.

01:05:27.657 --> 01:05:31.761 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR OF A BENEFICIARY OF

01:05:30.260 --> 01:05:33.563 region:rollup2
THESE SERVICES I'M NOT GETTING

01:05:31.761 --> 01:05:35.865 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES BECAUSE IN THE

01:05:33.563 --> 01:05:36.933 region:rollup2
MEANTIME. THE THE PROVIDERS ARE

01:05:35.865 --> 01:05:38.468 region:rollup2
BEING SKEPTICAL THAT THEY'RE NOT

01:05:36.933 --> 01:05:40.570 region:rollup2
GOING TO GET PAID SO SOMEWHERE

01:05:38.468 --> 01:05:41.137 region:rollup2
ALONG THE LINE THERE'S SOME

01:05:40.570 --> 01:05:41.438 region:rollup2
FOLKS THAT ARE NOT RECEIVING

01:05:41.137 --> 01:05:43.506 region:rollup2
TREATMENT.

01:05:41.438 --> 01:05:44.741 region:rollup2
IS WHAT. KIND OF I'M LOOKING

01:05:43.506 --> 01:05:46.409 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE WE'VE BEEN WORKING

01:05:44.741 --> 01:05:47.677 region:rollup2
ON.

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:49.746 region:rollup2
COUNTY BY COUNTY PROVIDER BY

01:05:47.677 --> 01:05:51.815 region:rollup2
PROVIDER BASIS ON CONTRACTING

01:05:49.746 --> 01:05:53.850 region:rollup2
ISSUES AND SO I'M AT THIS POINT

01:05:51.815 --> 01:05:55.118 region:rollup2
IN TIME I AM NOT AWARE THAT

01:05:53.850 --> 01:05:57.520 region:rollup2
PEOPLE ARE NOT GETTING SERVICES

01:05:55.118 --> 01:05:58.955 region:rollup2
BUT IF YOU HAVE EVIDENCE THAT

01:05:57.520 --> 01:06:00.190 region:rollup2
CONTRARY AND HAPPY TO FRIGHTEN

01:05:58.955 --> 01:06:02.325 region:rollup2
ANNOYED SO I WOULD LIKE. TO SEE

01:06:00.190 --> 01:06:03.893 region:rollup2
IF THERE IS EVIDENCE OFNO I AND

01:06:02.325 --> 01:06:05.562 region:rollup2
I KNOW YOU GUYS HAVE SOME KIND

01:06:03.893 --> 01:06:06.896 region:rollup2
OF A DATABASE I WOULD. PRESUME

01:06:05.562 --> 01:06:08.398 region:rollup2
THAT THAT TELLS YOU HOW MANY

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:09.766 region:rollup2
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN SERVICE AND WE

01:06:08.398 --> 01:06:11.768 region:rollup2
CAN COMPARE FROM THE LAST YEAR

01:06:09.766 --> 01:06:13.369 region:rollup2
TO THIS YEAR OR WHATEVER IT MAY

01:06:11.768 --> 01:06:13.970 region:rollup2
BE. THAT'S NUMBER ONE BUT NUMBER

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:16.239 region:rollup2
TWO.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:19.209 region:rollup2
BE OUT IN TERMS OF OUTCOMES

01:06:16.239 --> 01:06:21.177 region:rollup2
HAVE WE SEEN AN INCREASE AYE AND

01:06:19.209 --> 01:06:22.946 region:rollup2
SERVICES OR AN INCREASE AND.

01:06:21.177 --> 01:06:23.813 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ISSUES THAT THESE

01:06:22.946 --> 01:06:25.415 region:rollup2
FOLKS ARE HAVING BECAUSE THEY'RE

01:06:23.813 --> 01:06:27.917 region:rollup2
NOT RECEIVING SERVICES OR IS

01:06:25.415 --> 01:06:30.086 region:rollup2
THERE ANY NO EVIDENCE OF OF.

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:31.254 region:rollup2
OVERDOSES OR DEATH BECAUSE OF

01:06:30.086 --> 01:06:33.823 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES ARE NOT BEING

01:06:31.254 --> 01:06:34.958 region:rollup2
PROVIDED TO WE KEEP ANY KIND OF

01:06:33.823 --> 01:06:36.426 region:rollup2
IDEA LIKE THAT.

01:06:34.958 --> 01:06:37.327 region:rollup2
SO THE OPI DASHBOARD THAT I

01:06:36.426 --> 01:06:38.661 region:rollup2
REFERENCED EARLIER THAT'S

01:06:37.327 --> 01:06:41.731 region:rollup2
MAINTAINED BY DEPARTMENT PUBLIC

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:43.399 region:rollup2
HEALTH SHOWS OPIOID OVERDOSE AND

01:06:41.731 --> 01:06:45.702 region:rollup2
DEATH RATES BY COUNTY HOME.

01:06:43.399 --> 01:06:48.371 region:rollup2
I THINK GIVEN THE.

01:06:45.702 --> 01:06:49.272 region:rollup2
DOES IT DO A COMPARISON FROM

01:06:48.371 --> 01:06:51.007 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS YEAR AND THE YEAR

01:06:49.272 --> 01:06:52.742 region:rollup2
BEFORE COULD NOT BELIEVE SO BUT

01:06:51.007 --> 01:06:54.143 region:rollup2
I WOULD. I WOULD CERTAINLY DEFER

01:06:52.742 --> 01:06:56.012 region:rollup2
TO MY COLLEAGUES AT THE

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:56.412 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH.

01:06:56.012 --> 01:06:58.248 region:rollup2
.

01:06:56.412 --> 01:06:59.682 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE A WE KNOW HOW MANY

01:06:58.248 --> 01:07:00.283 region:rollup2
UNITS OF SERVICE THAT WE'VE

01:06:59.682 --> 01:07:00.850 region:rollup2
DELIVERED ON A YEAR TO YEAR

01:07:00.283 --> 01:07:04.220 region:rollup2
BASIS.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:05.788 region:rollup2
SO FOR EXAMPLE ENOUGH IN THE

01:07:04.220 --> 01:07:08.024 region:rollup2
DATA THAT I CITED EARLIER.

01:07:05.788 --> 01:07:10.093 region:rollup2
FOR LOS ANGELES COUNTY WITH THE

01:07:08.024 --> 01:07:11.494 region:rollup2
FUNDING SOURCES THAT THEY HAVE

01:07:10.093 --> 01:07:12.462 region:rollup2
RECEIVED UNDER THE ODS WAIVER.

01:07:11.494 --> 01:07:14.464 region:rollup2
THEY'VE DELIVERED APPROXIMATELY

01:07:12.462 --> 01:07:16.299 region:rollup2
THREE MILLION UNITS OF SERVICE

01:07:14.464 --> 01:07:17.734 region:rollup2
AND THAT COULD BE RESIDENTIAL

01:07:16.299 --> 01:07:18.868 region:rollup2
THAT COULD BE OUT PATIENT COULD

01:07:17.734 --> 01:07:20.470 region:rollup2
BE MEDICATIONS HAS TO TREATMENT.

01:07:18.868 --> 01:07:22.672 region:rollup2
I'M ON A COUNTY BY COUNTY BASIS

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:24.440 region:rollup2
WE CAN SAY YEAR OVER YEAR HOW

01:07:22.672 --> 01:07:24.741 region:rollup2
MANY UNITS OF SERVICE WERE

01:07:24.440 --> 01:07:26.676 region:rollup2
DELIVERED.

01:07:24.741 --> 01:07:28.177 region:rollup2
BUT IT ALSO.

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:30.079 region:rollup2
.

01:07:28.177 --> 01:07:32.081 region:rollup2
IS INCLUSIVE OF ALCOHOL OTHER

01:07:30.079 --> 01:07:34.017 region:rollup2
SUBSTANCES I'M SO IT'S NOT

01:07:32.081 --> 01:07:37.887 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY LIMITED TO OPIOID SO

01:07:34.017 --> 01:07:37.887 region:rollup2
THERE'S THERE ARE.

01:07:37.954 --> 01:07:40.857 region:rollup2
HOW MANY UNITS OF SERVICE HAVE

01:07:39.389 --> 01:07:43.960 region:rollup2
BEEN DELIVERED BY THE COUNTIES.

01:07:40.857 --> 01:07:44.827 region:rollup2
I THINK.

01:07:43.960 --> 01:07:46.629 region:rollup2
WOULD REDUCE WHICH. I KNOW I

01:07:44.827 --> 01:07:47.664 region:rollup2
SAID LAST QUESTION BUT THIS IS

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:50.266 region:rollup2
THE LAST QUESTION.

01:07:47.664 --> 01:07:52.568 region:rollup2
REGARDING PROP SIXTY FOUR IT

01:07:50.266 --> 01:07:53.803 region:rollup2
CAN WE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT

01:07:52.568 --> 01:07:55.171 region:rollup2
WHEN WE EXPECT TO START

01:07:53.803 --> 01:07:57.840 region:rollup2
COLLECTING REVENUE SPENDING

01:07:55.171 --> 01:07:59.175 region:rollup2
PRIORITIES.

01:07:57.840 --> 01:08:00.577 region:rollup2
TO SOME OF THE GENERAL

01:07:59.175 --> 01:08:02.111 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS WE HAD THE AGENDA SO

01:08:00.577 --> 01:08:04.314 region:rollup2
CHRIS CUT FROM FINANCE.

01:08:02.111 --> 01:08:05.715 region:rollup2
I BELIEVE THE BUDGET YEAR AND I

01:08:04.314 --> 01:08:07.283 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THAT FORGIVE ME I

01:08:05.715 --> 01:08:07.951 region:rollup2
DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBER OF

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:10.553 region:rollup2
FROM ME BUT I BELIEVE THE BUDGET

01:08:07.951 --> 01:08:13.623 region:rollup2
YEAR DOES. REFLECT SOME REVENUES

01:08:10.553 --> 01:08:13.823 region:rollup2
COMING IN FOR. PROPOSITION SIXTY

01:08:13.623 --> 01:08:15.391 region:rollup2
FOUR.

01:08:13.823 --> 01:08:17.093 region:rollup2
.

01:08:15.391 --> 01:08:19.562 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY FOR DH CSO THE

01:08:17.093 --> 01:08:21.097 region:rollup2
BUDGET HERE DOES NOT REFLECT ANY

01:08:19.562 --> 01:08:24.067 region:rollup2
REVENUE SPECIFICALLY FOR THAT

01:08:21.097 --> 01:08:25.601 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT SO BASED ON THE TAX

01:08:24.067 --> 01:08:26.569 region:rollup2
THAT THE. THE LAW THAT WAS

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:28.905 region:rollup2
IMPLEMENTED.

01:08:26.569 --> 01:08:30.206 region:rollup2
THERE'RE A PRIORITIES TO WHICH

01:08:28.905 --> 01:08:32.809 region:rollup2
WHICH DEPARTMENTS RECEIVE

01:08:30.206 --> 01:08:35.111 region:rollup2
FUNDING DHS BEING NOT IN THE TOP

01:08:32.809 --> 01:08:37.847 region:rollup2
PRIORITY BUT ONE OF THEM.

01:08:35.111 --> 01:08:39.048 region:rollup2
ON THE LOWER END OF THE SPENT

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:41.551 region:rollup2
ON THE PARTY LIST.

01:08:39.048 --> 01:08:42.585 region:rollup2
AND SO THEY HAVE. THOSE ARE NOT

01:08:41.551 --> 01:08:44.721 region:rollup2
CONTEMPLATED FOR EIGHTEEN

01:08:42.585 --> 01:08:48.224 region:rollup2
NINETEEN AT THIS TIME.

01:08:44.721 --> 01:08:49.726 region:rollup2
FOR. THE NEXT FISCAL YEAR HAVE

01:08:48.224 --> 01:08:52.095 region:rollup2
WE ARE IN THE START TO DIG TO

01:08:49.726 --> 01:08:55.031 region:rollup2
SET SOME OF THOSE. PRIORITIES

01:08:52.095 --> 01:08:56.899 region:rollup2
ARE WE. LETTING THE NEXT

01:08:55.031 --> 01:08:58.134 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION DECIDE.

01:08:56.899 --> 01:08:58.835 region:rollup2
HOW IT YEAH I MEAN I THINK

01:08:58.134 --> 01:09:01.304 region:rollup2
THERE'S IT'S A TWO IF IT'S A TWO

01:08:58.835 --> 01:09:03.306 region:rollup2
PART PROCESS RIGHT SO FINANCE?

01:09:01.304 --> 01:09:04.907 region:rollup2
WILL OBVIOUSLY ASSESSED ALL THE

01:09:03.306 --> 01:09:06.376 region:rollup2
REVENUES THAT COME IN ON PROP

01:09:04.907 --> 01:09:07.877 region:rollup2
SIXTY FOUR AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:09:06.376 --> 01:09:10.079 region:rollup2
OTHER BUCKETS THAT HAVE TO BE

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:12.248 region:rollup2
FILLED BEFORE IT COMES DOWN TO

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:12.615 region:rollup2
OUR AND BUCKET. I THINK THEN

01:09:12.248 --> 01:09:14.650 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:15.918 region:rollup2
INITIATIVE BOTH CONTEMPLATES

01:09:14.650 --> 01:09:17.654 region:rollup2
AND THIS IS OUR PROCESS AND

01:09:15.918 --> 01:09:19.022 region:rollup2
THOUGHT GOING FORWARD IS THAT WE

01:09:17.654 --> 01:09:20.423 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE KIND OF BROAD

01:09:19.022 --> 01:09:22.725 region:rollup2
STAKEHOLDER.

01:09:20.423 --> 01:09:24.327 region:rollup2
GROUPS AROUND WHAT THAT MONEY

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.094 region:rollup2
COULD AND SHOULD BE USED FOR

01:09:24.327 --> 01:09:27.530 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I THINK THE INITIATIVE

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:29.265 region:rollup2
KIND OF OUTLINES BROADLY WHAT IT

01:09:27.530 --> 01:09:30.400 region:rollup2
CAN BE USED FOR.

01:09:29.265 --> 01:09:31.601 region:rollup2
.

01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:33.302 region:rollup2
BUT IS A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION.

01:09:31.601 --> 01:09:34.437 region:rollup2
IF IT'S YOU KNOW AND I'M MAKING

01:09:33.302 --> 01:09:35.838 region:rollup2
UP A NUMBER OF ITS NINE MILLION

01:09:34.437 --> 01:09:37.673 region:rollup2
DOLLARS VERSUS NINETY MILLION

01:09:35.838 --> 01:09:38.841 region:rollup2
DOLLARS. THERE'S THERE'S A VERY

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:40.643 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT

01:09:38.841 --> 01:09:41.010 region:rollup2
YOU COULD USE WITH THOSE FUNDS

01:09:40.643 --> 01:09:42.612 region:rollup2
AND SO I THINK.

01:09:41.010 --> 01:09:44.047 region:rollup2
.

01:09:42.612 --> 01:09:44.981 region:rollup2
I WOULD SAY IT'S NOT NECESSARILY

01:09:44.047 --> 01:09:46.049 region:rollup2
WAITING FOR THE NEXT

01:09:44.981 --> 01:09:47.150 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION IS THAT YOU NEED

01:09:46.049 --> 01:09:48.518 region:rollup2
TO HAVE A NUMBER TO KNOW WHAT

01:09:47.150 --> 01:09:50.119 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BEFORE YOU

01:09:48.518 --> 01:09:52.488 region:rollup2
SPEND THE MONEY BECAUSE IT HELPS

01:09:50.119 --> 01:09:54.057 region:rollup2
ALSO. ON SET EXPECTATIONS AND

01:09:52.488 --> 01:09:55.391 region:rollup2
SOME KIND OF FISCAL BOUNDARY

01:09:54.057 --> 01:09:56.626 region:rollup2
AROUND WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:58.461 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING SOURCE.

01:09:56.626 --> 01:10:00.563 region:rollup2
SO I THINK I THINK WE'RE

01:09:58.461 --> 01:10:01.564 region:rollup2
COMMITTED TO THE PROCESS THAT

01:10:00.563 --> 01:10:03.332 region:rollup2
THE INITIATIVE LAYS OUT IN TERMS

01:10:01.564 --> 01:10:03.900 region:rollup2
OF WORKING WITH A LOT OF

01:10:03.332 --> 01:10:05.635 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT PEOPLE TO DEVELOP

01:10:03.900 --> 01:10:07.103 region:rollup2
SOMETHING. WHETHER IT BE USED IN

01:10:05.635 --> 01:10:08.704 region:rollup2
TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OR A

01:10:07.103 --> 01:10:10.073 region:rollup2
COMBINATION ON THAT WE DON'T

01:10:08.704 --> 01:10:11.974 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY WE HAVEN'T STARTED THAT

01:10:10.073 --> 01:10:13.543 region:rollup2
YET BECAUSE WE JUST HAVEN'T.

01:10:11.974 --> 01:10:14.177 region:rollup2
HAD IN IT ANY.

01:10:13.543 --> 01:10:14.377 region:rollup2
CONCRETE FISCAL NUMBERS TO TALK

01:10:14.177 --> 01:10:16.612 region:rollup2
ABOUT

01:10:14.377 --> 01:10:19.449 region:rollup2
TO.

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:19.716 region:rollup2
PLEASE.

01:10:19.449 --> 01:10:21.517 region:rollup2
NO I JUST.

01:10:19.716 --> 01:10:22.785 region:rollup2
.

01:10:21.517 --> 01:10:24.787 region:rollup2
SO THERE HAVE BEEN NO ESTIMATES

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:29.792 region:rollup2
FOR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BECAUSE WE

01:10:24.787 --> 01:10:30.493 region:rollup2
DON'T ASSUME THAT THERE WILL BE

01:10:29.792 --> 01:10:31.094 region:rollup2
ANY FUNDING NOT WHERE I DO.

01:10:30.493 --> 01:10:33.062 region:rollup2
DO WE HAVE ANY ASSUMPTIONS FOR

01:10:31.094 --> 01:10:35.064 region:rollup2
WHAT. WOULD BE THERE FOR THE

01:10:33.062 --> 01:10:36.499 region:rollup2
NEXT FISCAL YEAR SO THAT WE CAN

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:38.468 region:rollup2
HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS ORDER

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:40.002 region:rollup2
THOSE ONLY COME AFTER A YEAR'S

01:10:38.468 --> 01:10:41.838 region:rollup2
WORTH OF RECEIPTS SO THAT WE CAN

01:10:40.002 --> 01:10:42.872 region:rollup2
THEN. PREDICT BASED OFF OF

01:10:41.838 --> 01:10:44.440 region:rollup2
THAT'S CORRECT WE DON'T

01:10:42.872 --> 01:10:46.542 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY HAVE A MULTI YEAR HOW

01:10:44.440 --> 01:10:47.376 region:rollup2

01:14:51.420 --> 01:14:55.424 region:rollup2
FOR A SECONDS IT DOES NOT COME

01:14:53.456 --> 01:14:58.260 region:rollup2
NEAR COUNTING CAR ACCIDENTS

01:14:55.424 --> 01:15:01.130 region:rollup2
SUICIDES INFECTIONS AND OTHER

01:14:58.260 --> 01:15:02.565 region:rollup2

SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND I

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:09.472 region:rollup2
DON'T BELIEVE THAT NUMBER EITHER

01:15:07.570 --> 01:15:11.540 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I CHALLENGE EVERYONE IN

01:15:09.472 --> 01:15:13.809 region:rollup2
THIS ROOM WHO DOES NOT KNOW

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:14.276 region:rollup2
SOMEONE WHOSE LIFE HAS BEEN.

01:15:13.809 --> 01:15:16.612 region:rollup2
SILENTLY TORN APART BY

01:15:14.276 --> 01:15:19.648 region:rollup2
ADDICTION.

01:15:16.612 --> 01:15:22.151 region:rollup2
I SAW THESE PATIENTS EVERY DAY

01:15:19.648 --> 01:15:24.920 region:rollup2
AND I SAW THEM SPIRAL AND THEIR

01:15:22.151 --> 01:15:27.656 region:rollup2
LIVES ON RAVEL AND I WAS ON ABLE

01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:29.792 region:rollup2
TO INTERVENE IN ANY WAY.

01:15:27.656 --> 01:15:31.961 region:rollup2
I'M NOT CHANGED FOR ME TWO YEARS

01:15:29.792 --> 01:15:32.962 region:rollup2
AGO WE HAD A SUBSTANCE USE

01:15:31.961 --> 01:15:34.563 region:rollup2

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:43.005 region:rollup2
LIFELINE AND NOW PATIENTS THAT I

01:15:48.711 --> 01:15:53.549 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SEEN PATIENTS ACTUALLY

01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.016 region:rollup2
SUMMER PATIENTS I DON'T SEE ANY

01:15:53.549 --> 01:15:56.152 region:rollup2

WERE ABLE TO GET THEM INTO

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:03.726 region:rollup2
TREATMENT AND NOW I DON'T SEE

01:16:02.625 --> 01:16:05.995 region:rollup2

01:16:03.726 --> 01:16:07.496 region:rollup2
WE DO HEAR FROM PEOPLE WHO'VE

01:16:05.995 --> 01:16:08.731 region:rollup2
GOT THEIR LIVES TOGETHER WHO'VE

01:16:07.496 --> 01:16:11.100 region:rollup2
GOTTEN OFF THE STREETS

01:16:08.731 --> 01:16:12.334 region:rollup2
WHO APPROVED REALLY TURNED THEIR

01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:13.869 region:rollup2
LIVES AROUND.

01:16:12.334 --> 01:16:15.004 region:rollup2
I CAN TELL YOU THE PATIENT

01:16:13.869 --> 01:16:16.906 region:rollup2
POPULATION THAT WE'VE BEEN

01:16:15.004 --> 01:16:19.608 region:rollup2
SEEING IS A REAL VULNERABLE

01:16:16.906 --> 01:16:21.143 region:rollup2
POPULATION. SEVENTY ONE PERCENT

01:16:19.608 --> 01:16:22.978 region:rollup2
WERE COVERED BY MEDICARE HOW

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:25.481 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY FOUR PERCENT SELF

01:16:22.978 --> 01:16:27.216 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AS HOMELESS.

01:16:25.481 --> 01:16:32.221 region:rollup2
THIRTY THREE PERCENT HAD A DUAL

01:16:27.216 --> 01:16:32.721 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS SO WHERE CONCURRENT

01:16:32.221 --> 01:16:33.355 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIC DIAGNOSIS.

01:16:32.721 --> 01:16:33.989 region:rollup2
SERVICE IS A VERY BOND OF A

01:16:33.355 --> 01:16:35.858 region:rollup2
PATIENT POPULATION THAT WE'VE

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:37.359 region:rollup2
BEEN ABLE TO MAKE A POSITIVE

01:16:35.858 --> 01:16:39.728 region:rollup2
IMPACT ON.

01:16:37.359 --> 01:16:41.730 region:rollup2
YOU HAD MENTIONED MEDICAL DETOX.

01:16:39.728 --> 01:16:44.133 region:rollup2
SO BEFORE WE HAD A SUBSTANCE

01:16:41.730 --> 01:16:46.368 region:rollup2
USED. BEFORE WE WERE LINKING

01:16:44.133 --> 01:16:47.770 region:rollup2
PATIENTS TO TREATMENTS. I WAS

01:16:46.368 --> 01:16:49.238 region:rollup2
DETOXING PATIENTS IN MY

01:16:47.770 --> 01:16:51.140 region:rollup2
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS.

01:16:49.238 --> 01:16:52.842 region:rollup2
FOR NO REASON I WOULD GO THROUGH

01:16:51.140 --> 01:16:54.710 region:rollup2
THE PROCESS BECAUSE THEY HAVE A

01:16:52.842 --> 01:16:56.612 region:rollup2
LONG E. OUR STATE WE WOULD DO

01:16:54.710 --> 01:16:58.114 region:rollup2
OUR DETOX AND THEN I WOULD SEND

01:16:56.612 --> 01:16:59.548 region:rollup2
THEM BACK TO THE STREET ONLY TO

01:16:58.114 --> 01:17:01.517 region:rollup2
RETURN AGAIN.

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:03.185 region:rollup2
SO ALL THAT WORK THAT WE HAD

01:17:01.517 --> 01:17:05.321 region:rollup2
DONE IN THE EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT

01:17:03.185 --> 01:17:07.256 region:rollup2
WAS GOING NOWHERE.

01:17:05.321 --> 01:17:09.024 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT THIS IS A HUGE

01:17:07.256 --> 01:17:11.460 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY THAT THE STATE HAS

01:17:09.024 --> 01:17:13.395 region:rollup2
TO ADDRESS SUBSTANCE USE

01:17:11.460 --> 01:17:16.232 region:rollup2
DISORDERS AT THE MOMENT WHEN

01:17:13.395 --> 01:17:17.967 region:rollup2

ADDICTION TREATMENT AND WHAT%

01:19:13.115 --> 01:19:16.452 region:rollup2
BETTER WAY THAN HAVING ONE OF

CRACK SO.

01:28:22.264 --> 01:28:25.567 region:rollup2
THE FIRST I'M AS IT PERTAINS TO

01:28:24.099 --> 01:28:27.702 region:rollup2
THE NINETY MILLION DOLLARS UNDER

01:28:25.567 --> 01:28:29.304 region:rollup2
THE CURES ACT WHEN WE APPLIED

01:28:27.702 --> 01:28:31.072 region:rollup2

01:28:29.304 --> 01:28:32.641 region:rollup2
WE HAD INCLUDES SOMETHING

01:28:31.072 --> 01:28:34.309 region:rollup2
AROUND SUSTAINABILITY AFTER THE

01:28:32.641 --> 01:28:34.743 region:rollup2
GRANT FUNDS WENT AWAY THAT WAS

01:28:34.309 --> 01:28:35.911 region:rollup2
PART OF THE FEDERAL

01:28:34.743 --> 01:28:38.480 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS.

01:28:35.911 --> 01:28:40.315 region:rollup2
SO IT WAS GIVEN TO STATES WITH

01:28:38.480 --> 01:28:41.550 region:rollup2
THE VERY CLEAR AND EXPLICIT

01:28:40.315 --> 01:28:43.418 region:rollup2
UNDERSTANDING THAT THEY WERE NOT

01:28:41.550 --> 01:28:44.853 region:rollup2

01:28:43.418 --> 01:28:46.321 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO FUND THE SO.

01:28:44.853 --> 01:28:47.556 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY WAS PART OF OUR

01:28:46.321 --> 01:28:50.825 region:rollup2
APPLICATION.

01:28:47.556 --> 01:28:51.026 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF THIS PARTICULAR

01:28:50.825 --> 01:28:52.961 region:rollup2

RATES ARE NOT SET BY US AT THE

01:29:00.802 --> 01:29:04.439 region:rollup2
STATE LEVEL PER SE BECAUSE THE

01:29:02.671 --> 01:29:08.310 region:rollup2
FULL COMPLEMENT OF THOSE DRUGS

01:29:04.439 --> 01:29:10.745 region:rollup2

AND THEY SET RATES

01:29:14.349 --> 01:29:18.486 region:rollup2
SO THE REIMBURSEMENT WOULD BE

01:29:16.384 --> 01:29:20.789 region:rollup2
STRUCTURED UNDER THE COUNTY. I'M

01:29:18.486 --> 01:29:23.058 region:rollup2

01:29:26.428 --> 01:29:30.065 region:rollup2
BENEFIT SO THERE'S.

01:29:28.096 --> 01:29:31.566 region:rollup2
AGAIN IT'S BACK TO THE

01:29:30.065 --> 01:29:32.500 region:rollup2
COMPLEXITY OF THE RELATIONSHIP

01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:33.602 region:rollup2

ABOVE THE PROPOSITION THIRTY

01:29:44.479 --> 01:29:48.183 region:rollup2

HEALTH CRISIS OUR NATION IS

01:34:15.850 --> 01:34:18.820 region:rollup2
THIS WAS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

BE FUNDING ALLOCATED. FROM THE

DEPARTMENT I'M SHE THOUGHT GIVEN

01:42:23.371 --> 01:42:27.708 region:rollup2
THAT THERE THERE WAS A NUMBER OF

01:42:25.106 --> 01:42:29.176 region:rollup2
FUNDING STREAMS COMING IN TO.

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:31.212 region:rollup2

.

01:42:37.451 --> 01:42:40.454 region:rollup2

SERVICE IN ODS COUNTIES THEN

01:42:44.425 --> 01:42:48.429 region:rollup2
IT'S A COUNTY.

01:42:46.761 --> 01:42:49.930 region:rollup2

STATE'S FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY

01:42:55.469 --> 01:42:58.973 region:rollup2

THEY WANT TO PROCEED WITH THAT

01:42:59.840 --> 01:43:02.543 region:rollup2

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:18.259 region:rollup2
SMALLER AMOUNT THAN THE ACTUAL

01:43:16.357 --> 01:43:19.627 region:rollup2

THE RISK OF A FATAL DRUG

OVERDOS AMONG PEOPLE DURING THE

02:03:36.009 --> 02:03:39.579 region:rollup2
FIRST TWO WEEKS AFTER RELEASE

02:03:39.579 --> 02:03:42.282 region:rollup2
ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY NINE

02:03:41.114 --> 02:03:43.917 region:rollup2
TIMES AS HIGH AS THAT OF THE

02:03:42.282 --> 02:03:45.418 region:rollup2
GENERAL POPULATION.

02:03:43.917 --> 02:03:46.986 region:rollup2
A NORWEGIAN STUDY FOUND THAT

02:03:45.418 --> 02:03:48.788 region:rollup2
EIGHTY FIVE PERCENT.

02:03:46.986 --> 02:03:50.490 region:rollup2
OF DEATH IN THE TWO WEEKS AFTER

02:03:48.788 --> 02:03:52.058 region:rollup2
RELEASE WERE FROM DRUG OVERDOSE

02:03:50.490 --> 02:03:53.426 region:rollup2
AND IN NEW YORK CITY JAILS

02:03:52.058 --> 02:03:54.661 region:rollup2
THIRTY SEVEN POINT TWO PERCENT

02:03:53.426 --> 02:03:56.162 region:rollup2

OVERDOSES.

02:03:58.097 --> 02:04:00.767 region:rollup2
THESE HIGH RATES OF OVERDOSE

02:03:59.599 --> 02:04:02.502 region:rollup2
DEATHS ARE DUE TO THE FACT THAT

02:04:00.767 --> 02:04:03.736 region:rollup2
INCARCERATION OFTEN LEADS TO A

02:04:02.502 --> 02:04:05.238 region:rollup2
LOWER TOLERANCE THE TYPES OF

DRUGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE UPON

02:04:05.238 --> 02:04:08.541 region:rollup2

02:04:06.973 --> 02:04:10.810 region:rollup2
PEOPLE USE LESS DRUGS OTHER CARS

02:04:08.541 --> 02:04:12.045 region:rollup2
RATED OR NO DRUGS I HAVE AND

02:04:10.810 --> 02:04:14.280 region:rollup2
ALSO BECAUSE THE DRUGS IN PRISON

02:04:12.045 --> 02:04:16.249 region:rollup2
ARE USUALLY OF LOWER PURITY AND

02:04:14.280 --> 02:04:16.949 region:rollup2
STRENGTHENS STREET DRUGS.

02:04:16.249 --> 02:04:18.918 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE A

02:04:16.949 --> 02:04:19.953 region:rollup2

BIASED HE'S IN OUR SYSTEM

02:21:15.600 --> 02:21:18.637 region:rollup2
COMPARED TO ONE THOUSAND TWO

02:21:17.769 --> 02:21:20.639 region:rollup2

IT'S.

02:21:26.144 --> 02:21:28.980 region:rollup2
JUST KIND OF WITH NOT ONLY

FIFTEEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE.

02:21:34.619 --> 02:21:37.756 region:rollup2

TREATMENT PROGRAMS NOW AND TODAY

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:48.500 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S QUITE A FEW.

02:21:46.465 --> 02:21:49.868 region:rollup2
ON AN ANNUAL BASIS THAT ARE

02:21:48.500 --> 02:21:51.303 region:rollup2
SERVED EVEN THOUGH BETWEEN THE

STATE HOSPITALS AND THE JOB IS

02:21:51.303 --> 02:21:54.339 region:rollup2
COMPANIES TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE

02:21:52.938 --> 02:21:55.841 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU KNOW AN AVERAGE DAILY

HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE LAST YEAR

02:22:01.213 --> 02:22:02.347 region:rollup2
IN THE.

02:22:01.446 --> 02:22:04.015 region:rollup2
.

02:22:02.347 --> 02:22:05.684 region:rollup2
AND THE AGE OF IS COMPLICATED IN

02:22:04.015 --> 02:22:07.519 region:rollup2
TOTAL WE SERVED OVER FIVE

02:22:05.684 --> 02:22:08.687 region:rollup2
THOUSAND HIGHEST HE'S IN THOSE

02:22:07.519 --> 02:22:09.721 region:rollup2
TWO SYSTEMS.

02:22:08.687 --> 02:22:12.290 region:rollup2
AND SO THERE'S BEEN A

02:22:09.721 --> 02:22:13.959 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF INCREASING

02:22:12.290 --> 02:22:16.061 region:rollup2
CAPACITY IN THROUGHPUT ON THOSE

02:22:13.959 --> 02:22:16.661 region:rollup2
BEDS AND IN TURN AND TURN OVER

02:22:16.061 --> 02:22:19.464 region:rollup2
OF WHO WERE TRAINING IN THOSE

02:22:16.661 --> 02:22:21.433 region:rollup2
BEDS. AND LOOKING BACK JUST KIND

02:22:19.464 --> 02:22:22.968 region:rollup2
OF WALKING BACK THROUGH THE AND

02:22:21.433 --> 02:22:24.703 region:rollup2
THE WAIT LIST YOU KNOW IN IN

02:22:22.968 --> 02:22:25.237 region:rollup2
JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND FIFTEEN

02:22:24.703 --> 02:22:26.171 region:rollup2
IT WAS A THREE HUNDRED AND

02:22:25.237 --> 02:22:26.938 region:rollup2
EIGHT.

02:22:26.171 --> 02:22:28.473 region:rollup2
JUNE OF TWO THOUSAND AND

02:22:26.938 --> 02:22:30.242 region:rollup2
SEVENTEEN IT WAS FIVE HUNDRED

02:22:28.473 --> 02:22:30.942 region:rollup2
AND FORTY AND TODAY WE'RE

02:22:30.242 --> 02:22:32.944 region:rollup2
SITTING OUT.

02:22:30.942 --> 02:22:35.080 region:rollup2
LYNN APRIL IS NINE HUNDRED AND

02:22:32.944 --> 02:22:37.149 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO SO WE HAVE ADDED A

02:22:35.080 --> 02:22:39.284 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF CAPACITY

02:22:37.149 --> 02:22:39.918 region:rollup2
BUT CONTINUE TO SEE INCREASING

02:22:39.284 --> 02:22:42.120 region:rollup2
REFERRAL BASE.

02:22:39.918 --> 02:22:42.988 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S WHEN WE STARTED

02:22:42.120 --> 02:22:44.723 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT IT WE'RE NOT BUILDING

02:22:42.988 --> 02:22:47.359 region:rollup2
WHO ARE WAY OUT OF THIS AND SO

02:22:44.723 --> 02:22:48.660 region:rollup2
REALLY HOW DO WE ADDRESS THIS

02:22:47.359 --> 02:22:50.328 region:rollup2
FROM. FROM A DIFFERENT

02:22:48.660 --> 02:22:52.030 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE I'M FIRST FONG WERE

02:22:50.328 --> 02:22:54.933 region:rollup2
WERE OUT OF CAPACITY WENT MONTHS

02:22:52.030 --> 02:22:57.202 region:rollup2
WE AND MAKE THESE PROPOSALS.

02:22:54.933 --> 02:22:58.637 region:rollup2
THIS YEAR THAT'S REALLY THE

02:22:57.202 --> 02:23:00.839 region:rollup2
EXTENT OF CAPACITY IN THE STATE

02:22:58.637 --> 02:23:02.774 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL SYSTEM. AND WE CONTINUE

02:23:00.839 --> 02:23:03.742 region:rollup2
TO YOU KNOW PROPOSED ADDITIONS

02:23:02.774 --> 02:23:05.444 region:rollup2
TO THE JAIL BASS COMPENSATE

02:23:03.742 --> 02:23:07.312 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PROGRAM BUT REALLY

02:23:05.444 --> 02:23:09.514 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT WHAT ARE THOSE OTHER

02:23:07.312 --> 02:23:10.048 region:rollup2
SOLUTIONS AND SO I'M WILL TALK

02:23:09.514 --> 02:23:11.650 region:rollup2
AND IT WILL GO THROUGH THE

02:23:10.048 --> 02:23:13.351 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL'S BUT. AND TO THE

02:23:11.650 --> 02:23:14.486 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS ARE REALLY AND

02:23:13.351 --> 02:23:15.587 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT FOR US THIS YEARAND

02:23:14.486 --> 02:23:17.589 region:rollup2
ONE BEING.

02:23:15.587 --> 02:23:19.157 region:rollup2
A PARTNERSHIP WITH LA COUNTY TO

02:23:17.589 --> 02:23:20.425 region:rollup2
TREAT INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

02:23:19.157 --> 02:23:22.761 region:rollup2
PATIENTS IN THE COMMUNITY.

02:23:20.425 --> 02:23:23.929 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE SECOND BEING THE

02:23:22.761 --> 02:23:26.198 region:rollup2
DIVERSION PROGRAM.

02:23:23.929 --> 02:23:27.966 region:rollup2
WHICH IS LOOKING TOWARDS AND

02:23:26.198 --> 02:23:30.368 region:rollup2
GETTING OUT IN FRONT OF THESE

02:23:27.966 --> 02:23:30.936 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE CYCLING

02:23:30.368 --> 02:23:31.536 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

02:23:30.936 --> 02:23:32.537 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

02:23:31.536 --> 02:23:34.239 region:rollup2
DIVERT THEM FROM THE CRIMINAL

02:23:32.537 --> 02:23:35.674 region:rollup2
JUSTICE SYSTEM AND BEFORE THEY

02:23:34.239 --> 02:23:37.742 region:rollup2
COME TO US AS AN INCOMPETENT TO

02:23:35.674 --> 02:23:39.411 region:rollup2

THAT THE RIVER 'M SHOULD BE

02:23:41.213 --> 02:23:43.582 region:rollup2
RECEIVING AND THE IN THE

02:23:42.814 --> 02:23:45.584 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY.

02:23:43.582 --> 02:23:47.853 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S KIND OF LIKE A HIGH

02:23:45.584 --> 02:23:48.620 region:rollup2
LEVEL OVERVIEW OF AND THE

02:23:47.853 --> 02:23:50.589 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS COMING BY.

02:23:48.620 --> 02:23:51.923 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF THE THE

02:23:50.589 --> 02:23:53.425 region:rollup2
CHALLENGES OF WHERE WE STAND FOR

02:23:51.923 --> 02:23:55.127 region:rollup2
THE WE'VE BEEN DOING A LOT

02:23:53.425 --> 02:23:56.428 region:rollup2
WORKING FEVERISHLY TO TRY TO

02:23:55.127 --> 02:23:57.996 region:rollup2
STEM THE TIDE AND GET OUT IN

02:23:56.428 --> 02:23:59.364 region:rollup2
FRONT. BUT THE REFERRALS DO

02:23:57.996 --> 02:24:01.099 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO INCREASE.

02:23:59.364 --> 02:24:03.101 region:rollup2
FASTER THAN WE CAN OPEN

02:24:01.099 --> 02:24:04.603 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AND AND IT'S NOT JUST A

02:24:03.101 --> 02:24:06.037 region:rollup2
PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S

02:24:04.603 --> 02:24:08.340 region:rollup2
A NATIONAL TREND.

02:24:06.037 --> 02:24:09.975 region:rollup2

MEET THE THE GROWING THE GROWING

02:24:23.288 --> 02:24:25.857 region:rollup2
REFERRALS.

02:24:23.922 --> 02:24:27.859 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S KIND OF THE HISTORY.

02:24:25.857 --> 02:24:29.194 region:rollup2
SO REJECTED A START WITH THE

02:24:27.859 --> 02:24:32.664 region:rollup2

RECOMMENDATIONS ON THESE ICE TEA

02:34:01.966 --> 02:34:04.402 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS ONE ON THE ICE TEA

02:34:02.900 --> 02:34:06.237 region:rollup2
WEIGHTLESS.

02:34:04.402 --> 02:34:07.472 region:rollup2
SECOND ON THE ICY CAPACITY AND

02:34:06.237 --> 02:34:09.173 region:rollup2
THIRD ON ICE T. DAY VERSION I

02:34:07.472 --> 02:34:11.476 region:rollup2
WILL TRY TO GROUP THEM FURTHER.

02:34:09.173 --> 02:34:13.611 region:rollup2
IN THE INTEREST OF BEING CONCISE

02:34:11.476 --> 02:34:14.612 region:rollup2
FIRST ON THE ICE TEA WAIT LIST

02:34:13.611 --> 02:34:15.513 region:rollup2
AS AN APARTMENT XIN THERE'S

02:34:14.612 --> 02:34:17.415 region:rollup2
CURRENTLY NINE HUNDRED AND

02:34:15.513 --> 02:34:19.484 region:rollup2
SEVENTY TWO OR SO PEOPLE ON THAT

02:34:17.415 --> 02:34:20.618 region:rollup2
WAY LESS. AS CURRENTLY DEFINED

02:34:19.484 --> 02:34:22.453 region:rollup2
THAT INCLUDES BOTH PEOPLE

02:34:20.618 --> 02:34:23.488 region:rollup2
WAITING JUST BECAUSE THERE'S A

02:34:22.453 --> 02:34:25.523 region:rollup2
LIMITED.

02:34:23.488 --> 02:34:26.057 region:rollup2
A PASSIVE THE IN STATE HOSPITALS

02:34:25.523 --> 02:34:28.159 region:rollup2
IN JAIL BASED COMPETENCY

02:34:26.057 --> 02:34:29.227 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS BUT IT ALSO INCLUDES

02:34:28.159 --> 02:34:30.995 region:rollup2
SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE BEING

02:34:29.227 --> 02:34:32.196 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO DETERMINE WHERE THE

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:34.499 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT LOCATION

02:34:32.196 --> 02:34:36.200 region:rollup2
FOR THEM IS GOING TO BE.

02:34:34.499 --> 02:34:38.870 region:rollup2
REGARDLESS OF ADDING ADDITIONAL

02:34:36.200 --> 02:34:40.304 region:rollup2
CAPACITY THAT PROCESSING TIME

02:34:38.870 --> 02:34:40.938 region:rollup2
THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THEIR AS

02:34:40.304 --> 02:34:42.640 region:rollup2
THEIR DETERMINE WHERE TO TREAT

02:34:40.938 --> 02:34:44.075 region:rollup2
THEM. THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE

02:34:42.640 --> 02:34:45.676 region:rollup2
ON THAT WAIT LIST EVEN IF WE

02:34:44.075 --> 02:34:46.878 region:rollup2
INCREASE CAPACITY.

02:34:45.676 --> 02:34:48.713 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND IS THAT THE

02:34:46.878 --> 02:34:50.148 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO FIND WHAT IT

02:34:48.713 --> 02:34:51.849 region:rollup2
THINKS IS AN APPROPRIATE

02:34:50.148 --> 02:34:52.950 region:rollup2
DEFINITION FOR THE WAIT LIST SO

02:34:51.849 --> 02:34:54.485 region:rollup2
THAT I CAN TARGET HOW MANY

02:34:52.950 --> 02:34:56.788 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL BEDS.

02:34:54.485 --> 02:34:57.889 region:rollup2
TO ADD AND WE SUGGEST IS

02:34:56.788 --> 02:34:59.323 region:rollup2
DEFINING THE WAIT LIST AS

02:34:57.889 --> 02:35:00.691 region:rollup2
CONSISTING OF THOSE PATIENTS WHO

02:34:59.323 --> 02:35:01.959 region:rollup2
ARE NOT THAT PLACE WITHIN SIX

02:35:00.691 --> 02:35:03.661 region:rollup2
WEEKS OF BEING DECLARED

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:05.463 region:rollup2
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL.

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:07.565 region:rollup2
WHICH IS KIND OF A HIGHER LOW ON

02:35:05.463 --> 02:35:08.1000 region:rollup2
AN AVERAGE OF WHAT IT CURRENTLY

02:35:07.565 --> 02:35:10.368 region:rollup2
TAKES THAT APARTMENT TO PROCESS

02:35:08.1000 --> 02:35:12.403 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY.

02:35:10.368 --> 02:35:13.738 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE LEGISLATURE ADOPT

02:35:12.403 --> 02:35:15.139 region:rollup2
ASSOCIATED BUDGET TRAILER

02:35:13.738 --> 02:35:17.208 region:rollup2
LEGISLATION SO THEY GET

02:35:15.139 --> 02:35:17.775 region:rollup2
REPORTING EVERY MONTH ON HOW

02:35:17.208 --> 02:35:18.943 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THAT WAIT

02:35:17.775 --> 02:35:19.810 region:rollup2
LIST

02:35:18.943 --> 02:35:21.612 region:rollup2
ONCE IT HAS THIS CLEAR

02:35:19.810 --> 02:35:23.114 region:rollup2
DEFINITION IN MIND OF WHAT THE

02:35:21.612 --> 02:35:24.448 region:rollup2
WAIT LIST IS. A GOOD THAT THE

02:35:23.114 --> 02:35:26.584 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE THEM IN A POSITION

02:35:24.448 --> 02:35:28.019 region:rollup2
TO DECIDE HOW MANY BEDS IT NEEDS

02:35:26.584 --> 02:35:29.487 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO REDUCE OR ELIMINATE

02:35:28.019 --> 02:35:31.255 region:rollup2
THAT WAY LAST.

02:35:29.487 --> 02:35:33.090 region:rollup2
SO THEN ON TO DE ICE TEA

02:35:31.255 --> 02:35:35.193 region:rollup2
CAPACITY PROPOSALS. IT THE

02:35:33.090 --> 02:35:36.494 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE DEFINED DICEY WAIT

02:35:35.193 --> 02:35:38.462 region:rollup2
LIST AS.

02:35:36.494 --> 02:35:40.731 region:rollup2
NOT BEING PLACE WITHIN SIX WEEKS

02:35:38.462 --> 02:35:41.332 region:rollup2
WE THINK A LARGE PORTION OF THAT

02:35:40.731 --> 02:35:42.667 region:rollup2
WAY THIS COULD BE SERVICE WITH

02:35:41.332 --> 02:35:44.235 region:rollup2
THE.

02:35:42.667 --> 02:35:45.503 region:rollup2
PELE COUNTY PROGRAM THE

02:35:44.235 --> 02:35:46.938 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OUTLINED AS WELL AS

02:35:45.503 --> 02:35:49.841 region:rollup2
THE EXPANSION OF THE GEL BASED

02:35:46.938 --> 02:35:50.842 region:rollup2
COMPETENCY TREATMENT PROGRAMS.

02:35:49.841 --> 02:35:52.109 region:rollup2
IT IS LIKELY THAT SOME

02:35:50.842 --> 02:35:53.711 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL BEDS WILL BE NEEDED

02:35:52.109 --> 02:35:55.413 region:rollup2
AT A MORE INTENSIVE LEVEL THAT

02:35:53.711 --> 02:35:57.982 region:rollup2
THE STATE HOSPITALS THEMSELVES

02:35:55.413 --> 02:35:59.183 region:rollup2
PROVIDE SO WE DO RECOMMEND. THAT

02:35:57.982 --> 02:36:00.985 region:rollup2
IF. THE WEIGHTLESS WERE DEFINED

02:35:59.183 --> 02:36:02.353 region:rollup2
IN THIS MANNER TO ACTIVATE TO OF

02:36:00.985 --> 02:36:04.188 region:rollup2
THE UNITS AT THEM AT

02:36:02.353 --> 02:36:06.791 region:rollup2
METROPOLITAN STATE HOSPITAL. IF

02:36:04.188 --> 02:36:08.593 region:rollup2
THE WAIT LIST CONTINUES TO.

02:36:06.791 --> 02:36:10.361 region:rollup2
CHANGE AS WE GET TO MY REVISION

02:36:08.593 --> 02:36:12.663 region:rollup2
THE REMAINING UNITS THAT ARE

02:36:10.361 --> 02:36:14.065 region:rollup2
REQUESTED. DO YOU SAGE

02:36:12.663 --> 02:36:16.500 region:rollup2
METROPOLITAN COULD BE ACTIVATED.

02:36:14.065 --> 02:36:18.703 region:rollup2
AT A LATER TIME.

02:36:16.500 --> 02:36:20.238 region:rollup2
ONTO THE JAIL BASED COMPETENCY

02:36:18.703 --> 02:36:21.906 region:rollup2
TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE WOULD JUST

02:36:20.238 --> 02:36:24.008 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE

02:36:21.906 --> 02:36:26.010 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO A DIRECT APARTMENT

02:36:24.008 --> 02:36:27.245 region:rollup2
AT HEARINGS TO UPDATE ON THE

02:36:26.010 --> 02:36:29.213 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATING PROCESS FOR WHICH

02:36:27.245 --> 02:36:30.848 region:rollup2
COUNTIES ARE GOING TO OPERATE

02:36:29.213 --> 02:36:33.784 region:rollup2
THESE PROGRAMS. AND.

02:36:30.848 --> 02:36:35.786 region:rollup2
THERE PROP PROGRESS IN IN THOSE

02:36:33.784 --> 02:36:37.154 region:rollup2
NEGOTIATIONS AND ON THE LA

02:36:35.786 --> 02:36:38.823 region:rollup2
COUNTY PROGRAM SPECIFICALLY

02:36:37.154 --> 02:36:41.025 region:rollup2
GIVEN IT'S A NEW APPROACH WE

02:36:38.823 --> 02:36:41.826 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND PROVIDING THE FUNDS ON

02:36:41.025 --> 02:36:43.728 region:rollup2
A LIMITED TERM BASIS AND INCLUDE

02:36:41.826 --> 02:36:45.029 region:rollup2
A. AN EVALUATION OF THE PROGRAM

02:36:43.728 --> 02:36:46.898 region:rollup2
TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT'S

02:36:45.029 --> 02:36:47.665 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE AND WARRANTS. ONGOING

02:36:46.898 --> 02:36:49.066 region:rollup2
FUNDING.

02:36:47.665 --> 02:36:50.868 region:rollup2
AND THEN ON THE COALINGA

02:36:49.066 --> 02:36:51.636 region:rollup2
EXPANSION.

02:36:50.868 --> 02:36:53.271 region:rollup2
WE WOULD KNOW THAT THE

02:36:51.636 --> 02:36:54.906 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO STAFF

02:36:53.271 --> 02:36:56.374 region:rollup2
THESE FACILITY SIMILAR TO HOW IT

02:36:54.906 --> 02:36:58.209 region:rollup2
STAFF IT'S OTHER INDIO FACILITY

02:36:56.374 --> 02:37:00.278 region:rollup2
SO WE RECOMMEND APPROVING. THE

02:36:58.209 --> 02:37:01.579 region:rollup2
REQUESTED POSITIONS AND FUNDING

02:37:00.278 --> 02:37:02.713 region:rollup2
COVER WE WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT

02:37:01.579 --> 02:37:04.248 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENTS CURRENTLY

02:37:02.713 --> 02:37:05.683 region:rollup2
UNDERGOING A STAFFING STUDY TO

02:37:04.248 --> 02:37:07.451 region:rollup2
DETERMINE APPROPRIATE STAFFING

02:37:05.683 --> 02:37:09.120 region:rollup2
LEVELS ACROSS THE DEPARTMENT.

02:37:07.451 --> 02:37:10.187 region:rollup2
AND SO WE WOULD RECOMMEND

02:37:09.120 --> 02:37:12.256 region:rollup2
PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE IN THE

02:37:10.187 --> 02:37:13.257 region:rollup2
BUDGET TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT

02:37:12.256 --> 02:37:15.259 region:rollup2
TO COMPLETE THAT'S

02:37:13.257 --> 02:37:16.594 region:rollup2
STUDY BY JANUARY TEN TWENTY

02:37:15.259 --> 02:37:18.796 region:rollup2
NINETEEN. SO THAT THE

02:37:16.594 --> 02:37:20.298 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE'S IN A POSITION TO

02:37:18.796 --> 02:37:21.365 region:rollup2
ASSESS THE OVERALL DEPARTMENT

02:37:20.298 --> 02:37:22.566 region:rollup2
STAFFING LEVELS AND MAKE ANY

02:37:21.365 --> 02:37:25.202 region:rollup2
NECESSARY.

02:37:22.566 --> 02:37:27.138 region:rollup2
I BUDGET ADJUSTMENTS.

02:37:25.202 --> 02:37:29.006 region:rollup2
AND FINALLY IN REGARDS TO I T.

02:37:27.138 --> 02:37:30.908 region:rollup2
DIVERSION.

02:37:29.006 --> 02:37:32.743 region:rollup2
WE THINK TRYING TO DEVELOP

02:37:30.908 --> 02:37:34.412 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS TODAY BURKE PEOPLE AWAY

02:37:32.743 --> 02:37:34.779 region:rollup2
FROM STATE HOSPITALS. HOUSE A

02:37:34.412 --> 02:37:37.048 region:rollup2
LOT OF STUFF.

02:37:34.779 --> 02:37:38.582 region:rollup2
MERIT AS IT COULD REDUCE FUTURE

02:37:37.048 --> 02:37:39.884 region:rollup2
COSTS AND BE BETTER FOR THE

02:37:38.582 --> 02:37:41.552 region:rollup2
PATIENTS WHO ARE PARTICIPATING

02:37:39.884 --> 02:37:42.620 region:rollup2
IN THESE PROGRAMS. HOWEVER WE DO

02:37:41.552 --> 02:37:44.055 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND REJECTING THE

02:37:42.620 --> 02:37:45.690 region:rollup2
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS WE CAN

02:37:44.055 --> 02:37:47.491 region:rollup2
FIND THAT IT'S STRUCTURED TO

02:37:45.690 --> 02:37:48.759 region:rollup2
ACHIEVE THE INTENDED BENEFITS OF

02:37:47.491 --> 02:37:50.328 region:rollup2
ICE TEA DIVERSION.

02:37:48.759 --> 02:37:51.862 region:rollup2
THERE ARE THREE REASONS FOR THIS

02:37:50.328 --> 02:37:53.764 region:rollup2
FIRST WE FOUND THAT THE KEY

02:37:51.862 --> 02:37:54.632 region:rollup2
PROGRAM DETAILS ARE UNCLEAR SUCH

02:37:53.764 --> 02:37:56.701 region:rollup2
AS HOW THE FUNDING WILL BE

02:37:54.632 --> 02:37:58.636 region:rollup2
ALLOCATED WHAT SPECIFIC PROGRAMS

02:37:56.701 --> 02:37:59.937 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WILL PROVIDE.

02:37:58.636 --> 02:38:01.872 region:rollup2
WE FOUND THE COUNTY INCENTIVES

02:37:59.937 --> 02:38:02.773 region:rollup2
ARE UNCLEAR SUCH AS WHETHER

02:38:01.872 --> 02:38:04.608 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WOULD BE INTERESTED

02:38:02.773 --> 02:38:06.143 region:rollup2
ENOUGH UP TO PROVIDE MATCHING

02:38:04.608 --> 02:38:07.912 region:rollup2
FUNDING GIVEN THAT FELONY ICE

02:38:06.143 --> 02:38:09.814 region:rollup2
TEA TREATMENT IS FINANCIALLY A

02:38:07.912 --> 02:38:11.148 region:rollup2
STATE RESPONSIBILITY. AND THIRD

02:38:09.814 --> 02:38:13.084 region:rollup2
THE IMPACT OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD

02:38:11.148 --> 02:38:13.617 region:rollup2
LIKELY BE MINIMAL BECAUSE IT

02:38:13.084 --> 02:38:16.020 region:rollup2
WOULD TAKE TIME FOR THESE

02:38:13.617 --> 02:38:17.521 region:rollup2
DIVERSION PROGRAMS TO DEVELOP.

02:38:16.020 --> 02:38:19.123 region:rollup2
AND BECOME EFFECTIVE AND MEASURE

02:38:17.521 --> 02:38:20.591 region:rollup2
WHAT'S WORKING HOWEVER THE

02:38:19.123 --> 02:38:23.094 region:rollup2
FUNDING IS ONLY PROVIDED ON A

02:38:20.591 --> 02:38:24.929 region:rollup2
ONE TIME BASIS AS OPPOSED TO ON

02:38:23.094 --> 02:38:26.530 region:rollup2
A LONGER TERM BASIS AND THERE

02:38:24.929 --> 02:38:27.765 region:rollup2
ISN'T A MEETING FOR EVALUATION

02:38:26.530 --> 02:38:29.166 region:rollup2
OF THESE PROGRAMS FOR THE

02:38:27.765 --> 02:38:30.534 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE TO ASSESS WHETHER

02:38:29.166 --> 02:38:32.303 region:rollup2
THEY'RE EFFECTIVE.

02:38:30.534 --> 02:38:34.271 region:rollup2
SO IT'S AS AN ALTERNATIVE WE

02:38:32.303 --> 02:38:35.439 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT

02:38:34.271 --> 02:38:36.674 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENT TO WORK WITH

02:38:35.439 --> 02:38:39.143 region:rollup2
COUNTIES TO DEVELOP SPECIFIC

02:38:36.674 --> 02:38:41.078 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS. WITH THOSE KEY

02:38:39.143 --> 02:38:42.446 region:rollup2
PROGRAM DETAILS LAID OUT. AND

02:38:41.078 --> 02:38:44.215 region:rollup2
INCLUDING A PLAN TO EVALUATE

02:38:42.446 --> 02:38:45.249 region:rollup2
THEIR EFFECTIVENESS SO THAT THE

02:38:44.215 --> 02:38:46.751 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE COULD DETERMINE

02:38:45.249 --> 02:38:47.651 region:rollup2
THOSE PROPOSALS EITHER IN THIS

02:38:46.751 --> 02:38:49.053 region:rollup2
YEAR'S BUDGET OR IN FUTURE

02:38:47.651 --> 02:38:50.621 region:rollup2
BUDGETS.

02:38:49.053 --> 02:38:52.356 region:rollup2
IF THE LEGISLATURE CHOSE TO

02:38:50.621 --> 02:38:54.091 region:rollup2
APPROVE SUCH PROPOSALS WE

02:38:52.356 --> 02:38:55.393 region:rollup2
RECOMMEND PROVIDING FUNDING ON A

02:38:54.091 --> 02:38:56.694 region:rollup2
LIMITED TERM BASIS OVER A FEW

02:38:55.393 --> 02:38:57.862 region:rollup2
YEARS SO THAT THE PROGRAM CAN

02:38:56.694 --> 02:38:59.330 region:rollup2
START.

02:38:57.862 --> 02:39:01.532 region:rollup2
AND HOPEFULLY BECOME SUCCESSFUL

02:38:59.330 --> 02:39:02.867 region:rollup2
IN NOT REQUIRE A LOCAL MATCH

02:39:01.532 --> 02:39:04.835 region:rollup2
AND TO THE EXTENT THAT A

02:39:02.867 --> 02:39:06.470 region:rollup2
PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE

02:39:04.835 --> 02:39:08.305 region:rollup2
IN A COUNTY WE RECOMMEND THE

02:39:06.470 --> 02:39:09.907 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AT THAT TIME COULD

02:39:08.305 --> 02:39:11.342 region:rollup2
CONSIDER ON GOING FUNDING.

02:39:09.907 --> 02:39:12.910 region:rollup2
IF IF WE HAVE AN EFFECTIVE

02:39:11.342 --> 02:39:14.311 region:rollup2
PROGRAM ON OUR HANDS THAT IT

02:39:12.910 --> 02:39:15.413 region:rollup2
MIGHT BE WORTH CONTINUE IN AN ON

02:39:14.311 --> 02:39:17.214 region:rollup2
GOING BASIS HAPPY TO TAKE ANY

02:39:15.413 --> 02:39:18.282 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS.

02:39:17.214 --> 02:39:25.556 region:rollup2
THANK YOU VERY MUCH DEPARTMENT

02:39:18.282 --> 02:39:27.758 region:rollup2

CHRIS GOT DEPARTMENT FINANCE SO

02:39:27.758 --> 02:39:30.194 region:rollup2
WHILE FINANCING NOTES ARE

02:39:29.660 --> 02:39:32.396 region:rollup2
KNOWLEDGE IS THE ILLEGAL

02:39:30.194 --> 02:39:33.497 region:rollup2

COURSE OF THREE YEARS.

02:39:38.936 --> 02:39:42.640 region:rollup2

02:39:41.772 --> 02:39:44.775 region:rollup2
COUNTIES WITH A LOT OF

02:39:42.640 --> 02:39:46.210 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY TO QUICKLY RAMP UP

THAT THEY MARRY HAVE MANY OF

02:39:50.748 --> 02:39:52.116 region:rollup2
THESE COUNTIES IN WHICH.

02:39:51.916 --> 02:39:53.784 region:rollup2

02:39:52.116 --> 02:39:56.187 region:rollup2
THE FUNDING HAS BEEN PROVIDED

MENTAL HEALTH COURTS AND I

02:40:03.627 --> 02:40:06.730 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS IN PLACE WHERE THEY

02:40:05.529 --> 02:40:07.398 region:rollup2
COULD QUICKLY RAMP UP.

02:40:06.730 --> 02:40:08.933 region:rollup2
AND SO.

02:40:07.398 --> 02:40:10.034 region:rollup2
WE VIEW THIS AS PROVIDING THE

02:40:08.933 --> 02:40:11.202 region:rollup2

QUICKLY RAMP UP AND PROVIDE

02:40:11.202 --> 02:40:14.004 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL SERVICES WERE NEEDED

02:40:13.404 --> 02:40:15.105 region:rollup2
UTILIZING A LOT OF THEIR OTHER

AND THAT.

02:40:20.678 --> 02:40:23.948 region:rollup2
WE VIEW THAT.

YEAR PERIOD.

02:40:37.161 --> 02:40:40.631 region:rollup2
THEN THE ADMINISTRATION.

02:40:38.662 --> 02:40:43.734 region:rollup2
COULD CONTEMPLATE THE ONGOING

02:40:40.631 --> 02:40:44.101 region:rollup2
NATURE OF THEY DIS INVESTMENTS

02:40:43.734 --> 02:40:47.338 region:rollup2
TO THE EXTENT.

02:40:44.101 --> 02:40:48.272 region:rollup2
I MEAN. AT THAT TIME WHERE THE

02:40:47.338 --> 02:40:50.374 region:rollup2
OTHER PARTIES MAYBE.

THAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE.

02:40:54.712 --> 02:40:57.748 region:rollup2
SPECIFICALLY TO BUILDING UP

02:40:56.147 --> 02:40:59.250 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AS THE HOSPITAL'S I

02:40:57.748 --> 02:41:00.618 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT A LOT

02:40:59.250 --> 02:41:02.186 region:rollup2
OF THESE RESOURCES THAT WE'RE

02:41:00.618 --> 02:41:03.754 region:rollup2
CONTINUING TO DO REQUIRE CAPITAL

SERVICES AND A LOT OF THESE

02:41:10.060 --> 02:41:12.897 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE

ARE REALLY FOR THE STAFFING AND

02:41:12.897 --> 02:41:14.532 region:rollup2
SO.

02:41:13.964 --> 02:41:17.568 region:rollup2
JUST WANTED TO MAKE THAT.

02:41:14.532 --> 02:41:18.202 region:rollup2
I.

02:41:17.568 --> 02:41:19.270 region:rollup2
AND TO HAVE A.

02:41:18.202 --> 02:41:22.173 region:rollup2
YEAH.

THANK YOU.

HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY FURTHER

02:41:22.740 --> 02:41:26.677 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS. WE WILL NOW MOVE ON

02:41:24.842 --> 02:41:27.211 region:rollup2
THE PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUE

02:41:26.677 --> 02:41:29.046 region:rollup2
ELEVEN THANK YOU FOR BEING

02:41:27.211 --> 02:41:29.813 region:rollup2
PATIENT. THANK YOU MISTER

02:41:29.046 --> 02:41:31.415 region:rollup2
CHAIRMAN MEMBERS.

02:41:29.813 --> 02:41:32.716 region:rollup2
KOBE PRESIDING AGAIN WITH

02:41:31.415 --> 02:41:34.685 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF

02:41:32.716 --> 02:41:36.186 region:rollup2
PSYCHIATRIC TECHNICIANS AND WE

02:41:34.685 --> 02:41:37.621 region:rollup2
JUST LIKE TO NOTE THAT WE DO

02:41:36.186 --> 02:41:39.256 region:rollup2
SUPPORT EVERYTHING THAT THE

02:41:37.621 --> 02:41:40.257 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT IS TRYING TO DO IN

02:41:39.256 --> 02:41:43.027 region:rollup2
ORDER.

02:41:40.257 --> 02:41:44.094 region:rollup2
TO STEM THIS GROWING I S. T.

02:41:43.027 --> 02:41:46.864 region:rollup2
PROBLEM.

02:41:44.094 --> 02:41:48.299 region:rollup2
HOWEVER. I THINK IT'S VERY

02:41:46.864 --> 02:41:51.702 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE IST

02:41:48.299 --> 02:41:52.770 region:rollup2
REFERRALS ARE FAR OUTPACING OUR

02:41:51.702 --> 02:41:54.471 region:rollup2
ABILITY TO BUILD CAPACITY.

02:41:52.770 --> 02:41:55.806 region:rollup2
I THINK EVENTUALLY THIS

02:41:54.471 --> 02:41:56.607 region:rollup2
LEGISLATURE AND THE

02:41:55.806 --> 02:41:58.209 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION ARE GONNA HAVE TO

02:41:56.607 --> 02:42:00.277 region:rollup2
COME TO THE CONCLUSION.

02:41:58.209 --> 02:42:01.779 region:rollup2
THAT A NEW FACILITY IS GONNA

02:42:00.277 --> 02:42:03.480 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE BILL AT SOME POINT IN

02:42:01.779 --> 02:42:05.649 region:rollup2
TIMEIN THE NEAR FUTURE BECAUSE

02:42:03.480 --> 02:42:06.750 region:rollup2
THERE'S JUST NO WAY. TO HANDLE

02:42:05.649 --> 02:42:08.319 region:rollup2
THE AMOUNT OF REFERRALS THAT ARE

02:42:06.750 --> 02:42:10.721 region:rollup2
COMING IN.

02:42:08.319 --> 02:42:12.456 region:rollup2
ADDITIONALLY AS MANY OF YOU HAVE

02:42:10.721 --> 02:42:14.191 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY TOURED SOME OF THE

02:42:12.456 --> 02:42:15.826 region:rollup2
FACILITIES THE MOST RECENT

02:42:14.191 --> 02:42:17.761 region:rollup2
FACILITY IF YOU TAKE OUT GOING

02:42:15.826 --> 02:42:19.530 region:rollup2

METROPOLITAN. YOU'LL FIND THAT

02:42:28.606 --> 02:42:32.610 region:rollup2

WHERE IT'S HIGHER RISK IF LIKE

02:48:23.226 --> 02:48:25.796 region:rollup2
I SAID IF WE'RE HAVING AN ISSUE

02:48:24.595 --> 02:48:28.665 region:rollup2

THESE POSITIONS AND.

02:48:32.736 --> 02:48:35.505 region:rollup2
IF YOU CAN FIND THAT NUMBER I

02:48:34.504 --> 02:48:36.840 region:rollup2
REALLY WOULD APPRECIATE IT

BECAUSE WE CAN OUT ALL OF THE

02:48:36.840 --> 02:48:38.909 region:rollup2
POSITIONS THAT WE WANT BUT IF

02:48:37.641 --> 02:48:41.111 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T HAVE FOLKS TO FILL

02:48:38.909 --> 02:48:42.512 region:rollup2

02:48:41.111 --> 02:48:43.647 region:rollup2
FORWARD AND I APPRECIATE THE

02:48:42.512 --> 02:48:44.614 region:rollup2
COMMENTS ABOUT HOW MANY BEDS

02:48:43.647 --> 02:48:46.516 region:rollup2

IN IN IN ON THIS CAPACITY SO

02:48:52.823 --> 02:48:56.226 region:rollup2
THAT'S KIND OF A LONG WINDED

02:48:54.024 --> 02:48:58.061 region:rollup2
QUESTION BUT THE THE POINT TO IT

02:48:56.226 --> 02:48:59.796 region:rollup2
IS THAT. WE CAN INVEST ALL OF

02:48:58.061 --> 02:49:02.366 region:rollup2
THIS MONEY BUT IF WE DON'T HAVE.

02:48:59.796 --> 02:49:03.967 region:rollup2
FOLKS.

02:49:02.366 --> 02:49:05.902 region:rollup2
THAT ARE GOING TO FEEL SECURE

02:49:03.967 --> 02:49:06.436 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF THE RATIOS THEN HOW

BEING ARE WE.

02:49:19.383 --> 02:49:21.852 region:rollup2
CHASING OUR TAIL AT THIS POINT

02:49:20.450 --> 02:49:23.954 region:rollup2
BECAUSE AS THE WAIT LIST

02:49:21.852 --> 02:49:25.922 region:rollup2
INCREASE SAYS ARE WE JUST

02:49:23.954 --> 02:49:27.991 region:rollup2

02:53:52.923 --> 02:53:55.959 region:rollup2
AND.

02:53:54.491 --> 02:53:57.861 region:rollup2
AND TO.

02:53:55.959 --> 02:53:59.930 region:rollup2
ENSURE THAT WE.

02:53:57.861 --> 02:54:01.064 region:rollup2
WE CAN FILL THE POSITIONS BUT I

02:53:59.930 --> 02:54:02.365 region:rollup2
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE

02:54:01.064 --> 02:54:04.534 region:rollup2
ALWAYS REGARDLESS OF THE

02:54:02.365 --> 02:54:06.303 region:rollup2
POSITION VACANCIES HAVE TO MEET

02:54:04.534 --> 02:54:07.971 region:rollup2
THE STAFFING MINIMUMS FOR

02:54:06.303 --> 02:54:09.105 region:rollup2
LICENSING AND WE DO MEET THE OF

02:54:07.971 --> 02:54:11.107 region:rollup2
THE STAFFING MATT I'M

02:54:09.105 --> 02:54:12.509 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS FOR FOR LICENSING

02:54:11.107 --> 02:54:16.613 region:rollup2
SO. WE DON'T HAVE THE.

02:54:12.509 --> 02:54:16.947 region:rollup2
THE ABILITY TO TO DROP DOWN

02:54:16.613 --> 02:54:17.347 region:rollup2
BELOW THOSE.

02:54:16.947 --> 02:54:19.182 region:rollup2
.

02:54:17.347 --> 02:54:20.850 region:rollup2
WITH RESPECT TO THE WAIT LIST.

02:54:19.182 --> 02:54:21.818 region:rollup2
AND WE.

02:54:20.850 --> 02:54:24.220 region:rollup2
.

02:54:21.818 --> 02:54:25.488 region:rollup2
IT.

02:54:24.220 --> 02:54:26.256 region:rollup2
THAT'S HARD AND THAT'S HARD TO

02:54:25.488 --> 02:54:28.825 region:rollup2
PROJECT.

02:54:26.256 --> 02:54:31.494 region:rollup2
IT WHETHER ALL OF THIS CAPACITY

02:54:28.825 --> 02:54:33.530 region:rollup2
AND WILL DEFINITELY.

02:54:31.494 --> 02:54:34.998 region:rollup2
.

02:54:33.530 --> 02:54:37.901 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE THE IT'S A PROBLEM I

02:54:34.998 --> 02:54:38.335 region:rollup2
KNOW IT IS I THINK THIS YEAR

02:54:37.901 --> 02:54:39.869 region:rollup2
IT'S.

02:54:38.335 --> 02:54:41.404 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT HERE IN THAT WE ARE

02:54:39.869 --> 02:54:44.674 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE DEMAND SIDE

02:54:41.404 --> 02:54:45.542 region:rollup2
VERSES JUST CAPACITY SO CHANGING

02:54:44.674 --> 02:54:47.010 region:rollup2
THE.

02:54:45.542 --> 02:54:48.645 region:rollup2
THEDIRECTION THAT AN

02:54:47.010 --> 02:54:51.014 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL AND SORT OF CYCLING

02:54:48.645 --> 02:54:52.983 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE STATE HOSPITAL IN

02:54:51.014 --> 02:54:54.451 region:rollup2
AND AND. BEING IN AND BEING

02:54:52.983 --> 02:54:56.252 region:rollup2
IDENTIFIED AS ENCOMPASSING ON

02:54:54.451 --> 02:54:56.820 region:rollup2
TRIAL AND ENDING UP WITH A

02:54:56.252 --> 02:54:59.656 region:rollup2
CRIMINAL.

02:54:56.820 --> 02:55:00.957 region:rollup2
IT WITH CONVICTION OR A YOU

02:54:59.656 --> 02:55:03.660 region:rollup2
KNOW A RECORD OF SOME SORT

02:55:00.957 --> 02:55:04.894 region:rollup2
CYCLING BACK THROUGH THE SYSTEM

02:55:03.660 --> 02:55:06.596 region:rollup2
WE ARE AND.

02:55:04.894 --> 02:55:08.264 region:rollup2
PUTTING THE AND THE RESOURCES

02:55:06.596 --> 02:55:10.500 region:rollup2
INTO THE DEMAND SIDE SO

02:55:08.264 --> 02:55:12.235 region:rollup2
PROVIDING THE COUNTIES THE NEED

02:55:10.500 --> 02:55:13.503 region:rollup2
THE ASSISTANCE TO DATE NO

02:55:12.235 --> 02:55:15.238 region:rollup2
DEVELOP THESE DIVERSION PROGRAMS

02:55:13.503 --> 02:55:16.206 region:rollup2
THAT WILL HOPEFULLY CONNECT

02:55:15.238 --> 02:55:17.907 region:rollup2
THESE INDIVIDUALS IN A

02:55:16.206 --> 02:55:19.075 region:rollup2
MEANINGFUL WAY. AND PROVIDE IN

02:55:17.907 --> 02:55:21.177 region:rollup2
THE MEANINGFUL SERVICES TO KEEP

02:55:19.075 --> 02:55:21.811 region:rollup2
THEM FROM DOING THAT CYCLING

02:55:21.177 --> 02:55:22.746 region:rollup2
THROUGH AND COMING BACK THROUGH

02:55:21.811 --> 02:55:24.814 region:rollup2
THE STATE HOSPITAL

02:55:22.746 --> 02:55:26.983 region:rollup2
SO I THINK WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING

02:55:24.814 --> 02:55:28.685 region:rollup2
WHAT DIET AND.

02:55:26.983 --> 02:55:30.220 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHAT GREAT

02:55:28.685 --> 02:55:32.622 region:rollup2
IMPACT THAT CAN HAVE IT'S HARD

02:55:30.220 --> 02:55:33.923 region:rollup2
TO TELL BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE WE

02:55:32.622 --> 02:55:35.358 region:rollup2
HAVE IT WE DON'T HAVE CONTROL

02:55:33.923 --> 02:55:36.760 region:rollup2
OVER THE REFERRAL SO THEY DO

02:55:35.358 --> 02:55:37.927 region:rollup2
CONTINUE TO GO UP LIKE THEY HAVE

02:55:36.760 --> 02:55:39.295 region:rollup2
IN THE PAST.

02:55:37.927 --> 02:55:40.130 region:rollup2
WHICH WE HOPE THEY'RE NOT

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:41.765 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO SEND

02:55:40.130 --> 02:55:42.432 region:rollup2
THEM OFF ON THAT ON THE FRONT

02:55:41.765 --> 02:55:45.301 region:rollup2
END.

02:55:42.432 --> 02:55:46.970 region:rollup2
IS YOU KNOW WE WE ANTICIPATE

02:55:45.301 --> 02:55:48.505 region:rollup2
BASED ON THE CURRENT REFER ALL A

02:55:46.970 --> 02:55:50.140 region:rollup2
PATTERN THAT WE WE SHOULD SEE OF

02:55:48.505 --> 02:55:51.541 region:rollup2
SUBSTANTIAL DROP OVER THE NEXT

02:55:50.140 --> 02:55:53.276 region:rollup2
COUPLE YEARS. I HAVE WITH ME AS

02:55:51.541 --> 02:55:55.178 region:rollup2
WE BACK TO BEAT THIS CAPACITY IN

02:55:53.276 --> 02:55:56.846 region:rollup2
THE WEIGHTLESS.

02:55:55.178 --> 02:55:57.180 region:rollup2
THEN TO STOP.

02:55:56.846 --> 02:55:59.082 region:rollup2
I VISITED A.

02:55:57.180 --> 02:56:00.417 region:rollup2
.

02:55:59.082 --> 02:56:02.051 region:rollup2
CRUMBLING.

02:56:00.417 --> 02:56:03.486 region:rollup2
INFRASTRUCTURE AYE WHAT FROM

02:56:02.051 --> 02:56:05.889 region:rollup2
WHAT I SAW AND.

02:56:03.486 --> 02:56:06.823 region:rollup2
AT SOME POINT ARE WE GOING TO

02:56:05.889 --> 02:56:08.058 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW IT'S A COSTLY

02:56:06.823 --> 02:56:09.626 region:rollup2
ENDEAVOR AND I BUT I DO HAVE TO

02:56:08.058 --> 02:56:10.727 region:rollup2
ASK A REBIRTH HAVING ANY PLANS

02:56:09.626 --> 02:56:12.462 region:rollup2
ON. ON.

02:56:10.727 --> 02:56:13.296 region:rollup2
YOU DON'T PUT IN SOME MONEY

02:56:12.462 --> 02:56:14.697 region:rollup2
INTO THE MAINTENANCE OF THESE

02:56:13.296 --> 02:56:16.433 region:rollup2
PLACES AND THE ONE THAT I

02:56:14.697 --> 02:56:17.801 region:rollup2
VISITED. THAT REALLY WAS NOT

02:56:16.433 --> 02:56:18.701 region:rollup2
CONDUCIVE TO THE TYPE OF WORK

02:56:17.801 --> 02:56:21.004 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

02:56:18.701 --> 02:56:22.372 region:rollup2
WERE DOING AND SO TO BE HONEST

02:56:21.004 --> 02:56:24.107 region:rollup2
WITH YOU IN MY MIND AND I'M NOT

02:56:22.372 --> 02:56:26.242 region:rollup2
AN EXPERT BY ANY MEANS BUT IN MY

02:56:24.107 --> 02:56:27.110 region:rollup2
MIND THAT THINGS TO BE. YOU KNOW

02:56:26.242 --> 02:56:28.945 region:rollup2
COMPLETELY.

02:56:27.110 --> 02:56:30.880 region:rollup2
TOWARD TORN DOWN AND AND

02:56:28.945 --> 02:56:32.048 region:rollup2
REBUILT I MEAN THAT'S THE ONLY

02:56:30.880 --> 02:56:33.850 region:rollup2
THING THE ONLY WAY I THINK.

02:56:32.048 --> 02:56:35.452 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN.

02:56:33.850 --> 02:56:39.389 region:rollup2
.

02:56:35.452 --> 02:56:41.591 region:rollup2
IT WASN'T EVEN EASY TO ACCESS.

02:56:39.389 --> 02:56:42.959 region:rollup2
AND THE UNITED.

02:56:41.591 --> 02:56:44.461 region:rollup2
DANGEROUS SITUATION IF YOU CAN

02:56:42.959 --> 02:56:46.963 region:rollup2
ACCESS SAID THAT ALSO MEANS YOU

02:56:44.461 --> 02:56:48.097 region:rollup2
CAN GET OUT AND SO SO JUST

02:56:46.963 --> 02:56:49.399 region:rollup2
WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT

02:56:48.097 --> 02:56:50.633 region:rollup2
WAS INCLUDED IN THE COMMENTS

02:56:49.399 --> 02:56:52.268 region:rollup2
BECAUSE I SEE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

02:56:50.633 --> 02:56:53.837 region:rollup2
IS BEING CRITICAL TO. TO THE

02:56:52.268 --> 02:56:55.338 region:rollup2
ABILITY OF OF YOU KNOW FOR THESE

02:56:53.837 --> 02:56:56.473 region:rollup2
WORKERS TO DO THEIR JOB IT WAS

02:56:55.338 --> 02:56:59.142 region:rollup2
AND I WAS JUST REALLY KEEPING I

02:56:56.473 --> 02:57:00.677 region:rollup2
DO HAVE TO. TO TO SAY IT I AM

02:56:59.142 --> 02:57:02.345 region:rollup2
I'M NOT USED TO THAT BUT THE

02:57:00.677 --> 02:57:04.214 region:rollup2
FACILITY I VISITED THE. NURSES

02:57:02.345 --> 02:57:04.414 region:rollup2
STATION WAS IN THE MIDDLE AND

02:57:04.214 --> 02:57:07.117 region:rollup2
THEN.

02:57:04.414 --> 02:57:10.019 region:rollup2
THE THE INMATES WERE SO THEY'VE

02:57:07.117 --> 02:57:10.019 region:rollup2
GOT NOWHERE ELSE TO GO ALSO ALL

02:57:10.086 --> 02:57:14.090 region:rollup2
CIRCLING THE NURSES STATION AND

02:57:11.754 --> 02:57:16.292 region:rollup2
JUST ME. OUTSIDE LIKE WHILE IT

02:57:14.090 --> 02:57:18.461 region:rollup2
JUST FELT LIKE A SHARK CIRCLING

02:57:16.292 --> 02:57:20.463 region:rollup2
AND IT I'D I HONESTLY WAS WAS

02:57:18.461 --> 02:57:21.831 region:rollup2
VERY DISTURBED BY THAT. AND

02:57:20.463 --> 02:57:23.366 region:rollup2
THAT'S THE FIRST THING THAT I

02:57:21.831 --> 02:57:25.268 region:rollup2
THOUGHT OF YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS.

02:57:23.366 --> 02:57:26.236 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THE WORKERS IS HOW

02:57:25.268 --> 02:57:27.470 region:rollup2
DO THEY COME IN EVERY DAY AND

02:57:26.236 --> 02:57:29.606 region:rollup2
NOT ONLY AS A WORKER BUT THE

02:57:27.470 --> 02:57:31.307 region:rollup2
FAMILY MEMBERS IT I FELT LIKE IT

02:57:29.606 --> 02:57:32.609 region:rollup2
WAS A POLICE OFFICER. YOU KNOW

02:57:31.307 --> 02:57:35.245 region:rollup2
WHEN THE THE POLICE OFFICER.

02:57:32.609 --> 02:57:36.179 region:rollup2
GOES OUT TO WORK IN THE FAMILY

02:57:35.245 --> 02:57:38.214 region:rollup2
DOES ENOUGH THEY'RE COMING BACK

02:57:36.179 --> 02:57:38.815 region:rollup2
OR NOT AND I AND THAT'S REALLY

02:57:38.214 --> 02:57:39.649 region:rollup2
HOW I FELT SO I THINK WE NEED

02:57:38.815 --> 02:57:42.118 region:rollup2
TO.

02:57:39.649 --> 02:57:43.153 region:rollup2
REALLY BE MINDFUL ABOUT HOW WE

02:57:42.118 --> 02:57:45.922 region:rollup2
SET THESE TREATMENT PROGRAMS UP

02:57:43.153 --> 02:57:47.757 region:rollup2
AND AND I CAN GO ON ABOUT THEY

02:57:45.922 --> 02:57:49.425 region:rollup2
HOW ARE YOU GOING TO FENDED OFF

02:57:47.757 --> 02:57:51.227 region:rollup2
ON THE FRONT AND I IT'S NOT LIKE

02:57:49.425 --> 02:57:52.595 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW ENDS IN SCHOOL I CAN. I

02:57:51.227 --> 02:57:53.796 region:rollup2
JOIN TORRENTIAL WITH KIDS AND

02:57:52.595 --> 02:57:55.598 region:rollup2
ANTIETAM SO THAT THEY DON'T GO

02:57:53.796 --> 02:57:56.599 region:rollup2
BACK HOW DO YOU PREVENT AND THE

02:57:55.598 --> 02:57:57.834 region:rollup2
BATTLE I LEAVE FOR ANOTHER

02:57:56.599 --> 02:57:59.736 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION AND MAYBE YOU CAN

02:57:57.834 --> 02:58:00.570 region:rollup2
HELP ME BY SENDING ME BE YOU

02:57:59.736 --> 02:58:02.071 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE PROPOSAL IS.

02:58:00.570 --> 02:58:03.706 region:rollup2
SO THAT I CAN READ ABOUT IT I

02:58:02.071 --> 02:58:04.908 region:rollup2
WON'T TAKE TOO MUCH TIME HERE TO

02:58:03.706 --> 02:58:06.776 region:rollup2
DO IT BUT THAT'S ALSO CONCERNED

02:58:04.908 --> 02:58:08.378 region:rollup2
HOW IS IT THAT. YOU KNOW YOU CAN

02:58:06.776 --> 02:58:10.380 region:rollup2
PREDICT WHO'S GOING TO BE.

02:58:08.378 --> 02:58:12.415 region:rollup2
INCOMPETENCE HISSED AS TO STAND

02:58:10.380 --> 02:58:13.983 region:rollup2
TRIAL AND AND BE ABLE TO PREVENT

02:58:12.415 --> 02:58:16.219 region:rollup2
THAT I THAT JUST DOESN'T FIT IN

02:58:13.983 --> 02:58:17.787 region:rollup2
MY MY MIND HOW WE CAN PREVENT

02:58:16.219 --> 02:58:19.522 region:rollup2
SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LIKE I SAID

02:58:17.787 --> 02:58:20.823 region:rollup2
WITH KIDS YOU CAN PREVENTED BY

02:58:19.522 --> 02:58:22.425 region:rollup2
EDUCATING THEM A LITTLE MORE BUT

02:58:20.823 --> 02:58:24.327 region:rollup2
HOW DO YOU HOW CAN YOU PREDICT

02:58:22.425 --> 02:58:25.562 region:rollup2
WHO'S GOING TO BE INCOMPETENT TO

02:58:24.327 --> 02:58:25.762 region:rollup2
STAND TRIAL SO. YOU KNOW IF YOU

02:58:25.562 --> 02:58:27.163 region:rollup2
CAN.

02:58:25.762 --> 02:58:28.631 region:rollup2
LOOK AT THAT SOME OF THOSE

02:58:27.163 --> 02:58:30.233 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS AND PERHAPS SEVENTY

02:58:28.631 --> 02:58:31.901 region:rollup2
SOME INFORMATION SO THAT WE CAN.

02:58:30.233 --> 02:58:33.269 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW BETTER UNDERSTAND HOW

02:58:31.901 --> 02:58:37.740 region:rollup2
THAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN I KNOW.

02:58:33.269 --> 02:58:38.741 region:rollup2
IT'S A DIFFICULT TASK BUT I

02:58:37.740 --> 02:58:39.342 region:rollup2
REALLY DO.

02:58:38.741 --> 02:58:40.643 region:rollup2
I SUPPORT THE PROGRAM ORDERED

02:58:39.342 --> 02:58:42.312 region:rollup2
THAT THE REQUESTS.

02:58:40.643 --> 02:58:43.680 region:rollup2
BUT WITH A TON OF QUESTIONS ON

02:58:42.312 --> 02:58:46.783 region:rollup2
HOW THIS IS GOING TO ACTUALLY.

02:58:43.680 --> 02:58:49.219 region:rollup2
BE IMPLEMENTED.

02:58:46.783 --> 02:58:50.653 region:rollup2
LET HIM MAKE A WEIRD SEGUE IF I

02:58:49.219 --> 02:58:52.989 region:rollup2
CAN PUT IN MEDICINE.

02:58:50.653 --> 02:58:55.491 region:rollup2
YOU EITHER TREATED THE SYMPTOMS

02:58:52.989 --> 02:58:57.760 region:rollup2
ARE TREATED THE DISEASE PROCESS.

02:58:55.491 --> 02:58:59.696 region:rollup2
AND INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL

02:58:57.760 --> 02:59:01.097 region:rollup2
IS A SYMPTOM.

02:58:59.696 --> 02:59:03.032 region:rollup2
IT'S NOT THE DISEASE PROCESS

02:59:01.097 --> 02:59:05.635 region:rollup2
THAT WORD TREATING.

02:59:03.032 --> 02:59:07.770 region:rollup2
AND SO THEN I HAVE TO ASK WHY

02:59:05.635 --> 02:59:09.138 region:rollup2
DID WE END UP IN THIS PLACE AND

02:59:07.770 --> 02:59:10.840 region:rollup2
SO. IT SEEMS LIKE WE HAVE

02:59:09.138 --> 02:59:12.775 region:rollup2
INCREASED CAPACITY WE'VE

02:59:10.840 --> 02:59:14.677 region:rollup2
INCREASED TURNOVER. BUT IT'S THE

02:59:12.775 --> 02:59:16.379 region:rollup2
INCREASED REFERRAL BASE AND SO

02:59:14.677 --> 02:59:17.880 region:rollup2
I'M. WONDERING IF THERE

02:59:16.379 --> 02:59:19.816 region:rollup2
SOMETHING UPSTREAM WERE NOT

02:59:17.880 --> 02:59:20.783 region:rollup2

MY QUESTION IS REALLY GOING TO

02:59:25.989 --> 02:59:30.927 region:rollup2
STAND AROUND.

02:59:28.091 --> 02:59:33.630 region:rollup2
WHAT WERE WEREN'T THESE?

02:59:30.927 --> 02:59:35.999 region:rollup2
PATIENTS ACCESSING SERVICES

PRIOR TO BECOMING AN ICED TEA.

02:59:35.999 --> 02:59:41.437 region:rollup2
IS THERE SOME CORRELATION TO.

02:59:39.035 --> 02:59:43.206 region:rollup2
RECENT MENTAL HEALTH VISITS DO

02:59:41.437 --> 02:59:45.575 region:rollup2
WE HAVE SOME OPPORTUNITY WITHIN

02:59:43.206 --> 02:59:46.175 region:rollup2
THE PREVIOUS SIX MONTHS OF THEM

TO HAVE IMPACT AND WHY I BRING

02:59:49.912 --> 02:59:54.384 region:rollup2
THAT UP IS REALLY AN OPPORTUNITY

02:59:52.215 --> 02:59:55.985 region:rollup2
FOR US TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS

02:59:54.384 --> 02:59:56.853 region:rollup2
DIVERSION PROGRAM. AND SEE IF

02:59:55.985 --> 02:59:58.955 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO

02:59:56.853 --> 03:00:00.556 region:rollup2
MAKE AN IMPACT.

02:59:58.955 --> 03:00:01.791 region:rollup2
YEAH AND I'M I'M JUST BEEN

03:00:00.556 --> 03:00:03.993 region:rollup2

03:00:05.061 --> 03:00:07.664 region:rollup2
TO JUST SECONDS HAD TO TALK

03:00:06.496 --> 03:00:10.400 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE.

03:00:07.664 --> 03:00:12.635 region:rollup2
THE DATA WITH RESPECT TO.

03:00:10.400 --> 03:00:13.236 region:rollup2

TO A TALK ABOUT.

03:00:16.706 --> 03:00:22.245 region:rollup2
THE.

03:00:18.341 --> 03:00:23.279 region:rollup2
THAT JUST TO KIND OF MAKE SURE

03:00:22.245 --> 03:00:24.213 region:rollup2
THERE'S A.

03:00:23.279 --> 03:00:25.915 region:rollup2
THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

03:00:24.213 --> 03:00:27.383 region:rollup2
WHAT WE UNDER STATUTE OR

03:00:25.915 --> 03:00:29.452 region:rollup2
REQUIRED TO DO IN PROVIDE

03:00:27.383 --> 03:00:30.753 region:rollup2
TREATMENT VERSES THE AND

03:00:29.452 --> 03:00:32.121 region:rollup2
TREATMENT THAT'S RECEIVED IN THE

03:00:30.753 --> 03:00:33.723 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY AND WHEN YOU SAY.

03:00:32.121 --> 03:00:36.292 region:rollup2
TREATING THE SYMPTOMS YOU ARE

03:00:33.723 --> 03:00:38.027 region:rollup2
OUR FOCUS IS WHEN WHEN THEY ARE

03:00:36.292 --> 03:00:39.629 region:rollup2
DETERMINED TO BE INCOMPETENT TO

03:00:38.027 --> 03:00:41.364 region:rollup2
STAND TRIAL AND REFERRED TO THE

03:00:39.629 --> 03:00:44.801 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF STATE HOSPITALS.

03:00:41.364 --> 03:00:47.537 region:rollup2
WE ARE OUR GOAL IS IDENTIFYING

03:00:44.801 --> 03:00:48.871 region:rollup2
THE BARRIER TO COMPETENCY.

03:00:47.537 --> 03:00:50.139 region:rollup2
CONTINUOUS ESTIMATE THAT BARRIER

03:00:48.871 --> 03:00:51.708 region:rollup2
IS PROVIDING THE TREATMENT AND

03:00:50.139 --> 03:00:53.309 region:rollup2
WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT THAT

03:00:51.708 --> 03:00:54.477 region:rollup2
BARRIER HAS BEEN RESOLVED. WE

03:00:53.309 --> 03:00:57.180 region:rollup2
IDENTIFY THEM AS BEING OF

03:00:54.477 --> 03:00:58.648 region:rollup2
RESTORED AND SEND THEM ON TO

03:00:57.180 --> 03:00:59.816 region:rollup2
BACK TO COURT TO GO THROUGH

03:00:58.648 --> 03:01:01.484 region:rollup2
THEIR DUE PROCESS IT'S VERY

03:00:59.816 --> 03:01:03.920 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT THAN A COMPREHENSIVE

03:01:01.484 --> 03:01:06.122 region:rollup2
FULL SCALE. YOU AND IT TREATMENT

03:01:03.920 --> 03:01:07.724 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S AN IMPORTANT

03:01:06.122 --> 03:01:10.193 region:rollup2
DISTINCTION BECAUSE WHEN YOU ASK

03:01:07.724 --> 03:01:11.027 region:rollup2
ABOUT YOU KNOW AND TREATING THE

03:01:10.193 --> 03:01:12.795 region:rollup2

AND YOU KNOW THAT THE BEST PLACE

03:01:12.795 --> 03:01:16.699 region:rollup2
FOR THEM TO GET TREATMENT IS TO

03:01:15.131 --> 03:01:17.233 region:rollup2
BACK IT UP AND WHICH IS WHY THIS

03:01:16.699 --> 03:01:19.202 region:rollup2
PROPOSAL IS COMING FOR YOU

TODAY.

03:01:19.202 --> 03:01:25.308 region:rollup2
THE BUT I WOULD WE HAVE DONE A

03:01:22.238 --> 03:01:26.909 region:rollup2
QUITE A BIT OF DATA ANALYSIS AND

03:01:25.308 --> 03:01:27.443 region:rollup2
SO I TALKED. TURN IT OVER TO

03:01:26.909 --> 03:01:28.945 region:rollup2
DOCTOR WERE BURNED TO TALK

03:01:27.443 --> 03:01:29.579 region:rollup2

BEEN STUDYING ARE HIGHEST TEETH

03:01:34.984 --> 03:01:37.887 region:rollup2
POPULATION FOR A LONG TIME SINCE

03:01:37.420 --> 03:01:39.822 region:rollup2
TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN

03:01:37.887 --> 03:01:42.625 region:rollup2
CONJUNCTION. WITH THE UNIVERSITY

03:01:39.822 --> 03:01:43.593 region:rollup2
OF CALIFORNIA DAVIS DEPARTMENT

03:01:42.625 --> 03:01:45.661 region:rollup2
OF PSYCHIATRY IN THE LAW.

03:01:43.593 --> 03:01:46.763 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE BEEN ACTUALLY CODING

03:01:45.661 --> 03:01:48.064 region:rollup2
EVERY SINGLE ICED TEA ADMISSIONS

03:01:46.763 --> 03:01:49.565 region:rollup2
SINCE THAT TIME AND NAPA STATE

03:01:48.064 --> 03:01:51.901 region:rollup2
HOSPITAL OVER FOUR THOUSAND

03:01:49.565 --> 03:01:54.170 region:rollup2
EMISSIONS. OF THUS FAR AND WE

03:01:51.901 --> 03:01:55.338 region:rollup2
HAVE A LOT OF LONGITUDINAL DATA

03:01:54.170 --> 03:01:57.840 region:rollup2
DESCRIPTIVE DATA ON THESE

03:01:55.338 --> 03:01:59.108 region:rollup2
PATIENTS AND. THE SHORT ANSWER

03:01:57.840 --> 03:02:00.009 region:rollup2
IS THERE HAS NOT BEEN AN

03:01:59.108 --> 03:02:02.412 region:rollup2
APPRECIABLE CHANGE IN THEIR

03:02:00.009 --> 03:02:03.713 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSTIC PROFILE IN THE RATE

03:02:02.412 --> 03:02:05.515 region:rollup2
OF MALINGERING IN THE RED

03:02:03.713 --> 03:02:06.983 region:rollup2
COGNITIVE DISORDERS IN THE RATE

03:02:05.515 --> 03:02:08.518 region:rollup2
OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS.

03:02:06.983 --> 03:02:10.787 region:rollup2
HOWEVER WE HAVE SEEN.

03:02:08.518 --> 03:02:12.588 region:rollup2
MARKET INCREASE IN THE NUMBER

03:02:10.787 --> 03:02:15.057 region:rollup2
OR THE PERCENTAGE OF PATIENTS

03:02:12.588 --> 03:02:16.359 region:rollup2
COMING AND WHO'VE HAD. A FIFTEEN

03:02:15.057 --> 03:02:17.994 region:rollup2
OR MORE PRIOR ARRESTS.

03:02:16.359 --> 03:02:18.795 region:rollup2
THAT NUMBER'S GONE FROM AROUND

03:02:17.994 --> 03:02:20.163 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PERCENT OF THE

03:02:18.795 --> 03:02:22.498 region:rollup2
POPULATION TO ABOUT FORTY FIVE

03:02:20.163 --> 03:02:24.500 region:rollup2
PERCENT.

03:02:22.498 --> 03:02:26.269 region:rollup2
SO AS WE DIG DOWN AND LOOK AT

03:02:24.500 --> 03:02:27.703 region:rollup2
THEIR ARREST REPORTS AND THEIR

03:02:26.269 --> 03:02:30.373 region:rollup2
RAPSHEETS WHAT WE'RE SEEING. A

03:02:27.703 --> 03:02:31.908 region:rollup2
QUALITATIVELY AS A PATTERN OF

03:02:30.373 --> 03:02:34.811 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE HAVING THE.

03:02:31.908 --> 03:02:37.213 region:rollup2
UNCONTROLLED PSYCHOTIC SYMPTOMS

03:02:34.811 --> 03:02:39.682 region:rollup2
CORPS IN CRISIS WHO ARE NOT HOW

03:02:37.213 --> 03:02:42.318 region:rollup2
MOST WHO ARE GETTING INTO.

03:02:39.682 --> 03:02:44.053 region:rollup2
ARREST SITUATIONS THAT.

03:02:42.318 --> 03:02:46.155 region:rollup2
ARE RELATED TO THE CONDITIONS

03:02:44.053 --> 03:02:47.390 region:rollup2
OF THEIR HOMELESSNESS POVERTY OR

03:02:46.155 --> 03:02:49.158 region:rollup2
THEIR UNCONTROLLED PSYCHOTIC

03:02:47.390 --> 03:02:51.694 region:rollup2
SYMPTOMS. AND THEY'RE SORT OF

03:02:49.158 --> 03:02:52.795 region:rollup2
RACKING UP MORE OFFENSES

03:02:51.694 --> 03:02:54.130 region:rollup2
MISDEMEANORS AND THEN THEY'RE

03:02:52.795 --> 03:02:55.565 region:rollup2
FINALLY GETTING THAT FELONY

03:02:54.130 --> 03:02:58.768 region:rollup2
CHARGE AND SOMETIMES THOSE

03:02:55.565 --> 03:03:01.037 region:rollup2
CHARGES. ARE AND.

03:02:58.768 --> 03:03:02.572 region:rollup2
I CHARGED AS FELONIES ONCE THE

03:03:01.037 --> 03:03:04.173 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER GETS INVOLVED IN

03:03:02.572 --> 03:03:06.442 region:rollup2
THE PATIENT IS PARANOID IT

03:03:04.173 --> 03:03:07.610 region:rollup2
BECOMES COMBATIVE. SO WITH SO

03:03:06.442 --> 03:03:09.111 region:rollup2
QUANTITATIVELY WE CAN

03:03:07.610 --> 03:03:11.480 region:rollup2
DEMONSTRATE THAT INCREASE AND

03:03:09.111 --> 03:03:13.749 region:rollup2
PRIOR ARRESTS QUALITATIVELY WE

03:03:11.480 --> 03:03:14.684 region:rollup2
CAN TALK ABOUT. OTHER CONDITIONS

03:03:13.749 --> 03:03:16.619 region:rollup2
SURROUNDING THOSE ARRESTS.

03:03:14.684 --> 03:03:17.920 region:rollup2
AND.

03:03:16.619 --> 03:03:19.288 region:rollup2
LOOKING AT THAT SAMPLE WE

03:03:17.920 --> 03:03:21.624 region:rollup2
DECIDED TO TAKE THE COATING

03:03:19.288 --> 03:03:26.395 region:rollup2
PROCESS STATEWIDE TO SEE IF THIS

03:03:21.624 --> 03:03:27.730 region:rollup2
WE GOT THE SAME RESULTS DID.

03:03:26.395 --> 03:03:29.398 region:rollup2
IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT

03:03:27.730 --> 03:03:30.900 region:rollup2
SAMPLE WHICH IS ABOUT FOUR

03:03:29.398 --> 03:03:33.002 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PEOPLE LAST YEAR.

03:03:30.900 --> 03:03:33.870 region:rollup2
WE ADDED IN QUESTIONS ABOUT

03:03:33.002 --> 03:03:35.104 region:rollup2
HOMELESSNESS BECAUSE OF WHAT WE

03:03:33.870 --> 03:03:37.373 region:rollup2
SAW WHEN WE LOOKED AT THE ARREST

03:03:35.104 --> 03:03:39.208 region:rollup2
REPORTS. AND WHAT WE SEE WHAT WE

03:03:37.373 --> 03:03:41.444 region:rollup2
FOUND IS THAT FORTY SEVEN

03:03:39.208 --> 03:03:44.113 region:rollup2
PERCENT OF THE SAMPLE. OF.

03:03:41.444 --> 03:03:44.747 region:rollup2
IC PATIENTS THAT WE ADMITTED.

03:03:44.113 --> 03:03:45.948 region:rollup2
WARNING AND SHELTERED HOMELESS

03:03:44.747 --> 03:03:47.416 region:rollup2
STATUS AT THE TIME OF THEIR

03:03:45.948 --> 03:03:49.185 region:rollup2
ARREST SO.

03:03:47.416 --> 03:03:51.621 region:rollup2
IF THEY WERE STAYING IN A

03:03:49.185 --> 03:03:53.322 region:rollup2
SHELTER ON CITIES COUCH.

03:03:51.621 --> 03:03:54.323 region:rollup2
IN SOMEBODY'S YARD IN THE TEN

03:03:53.322 --> 03:03:55.925 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT COUNT THAT AS ON

03:03:54.323 --> 03:03:58.661 region:rollup2
SHELTER TO THESE ARE THE FOLKS

03:03:55.925 --> 03:03:59.896 region:rollup2
LIVING ON THE STREET. ON JUST

03:03:58.661 --> 03:04:01.664 region:rollup2
ABOUT HALF THE SAMPLE.

03:03:59.896 --> 03:04:03.132 region:rollup2
WE ALSO DID A DATA SHARING

03:04:01.664 --> 03:04:04.300 region:rollup2
AGREEMENT WITH D. H. CS. OF

03:04:03.132 --> 03:04:05.534 region:rollup2
WHERE WE GOT MEDI CAL

03:04:04.300 --> 03:04:06.869 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION DATA TO TRY TO

03:04:05.534 --> 03:04:09.405 region:rollup2
FIGURE OUT TO YOUR POINTS ARE

03:04:06.869 --> 03:04:10.506 region:rollup2
THESE PEOPLE ACCESSING SERVICES.

AND IN THAT.

03:04:10.506 --> 03:04:12.174 region:rollup2
SAMPLE.

03:04:10.740 --> 03:04:13.276 region:rollup2
.

03:04:12.174 --> 03:04:14.744 region:rollup2
FOUR HUNDRED THAT WE DID LAST

03:04:13.276 --> 03:04:16.879 region:rollup2
YEAR WE KIND OF GAVE THE

03:04:14.744 --> 03:04:17.647 region:rollup2
IDENTIFYING INFORMATION D. H.

03:04:16.879 --> 03:04:18.681 region:rollup2
THIS AND THEY GAVE BACK THE

03:04:17.647 --> 03:04:19.849 region:rollup2
UTILIZATION DATA. AND WHAT WE

03:04:18.681 --> 03:04:21.884 region:rollup2
FOUND IS THAT.

03:04:19.849 --> 03:04:23.920 region:rollup2
ABOUT FORTY SEVEN PERCENT DID

03:04:21.884 --> 03:04:25.154 region:rollup2

ARREST.

03:04:28.424 --> 03:04:30.826 region:rollup2
A SO WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS KIND

03:04:29.825 --> 03:04:32.094 region:rollup2
OF THIS COMBINATION OF

03:04:30.826 --> 03:04:34.030 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE

03:04:32.094 --> 03:04:35.831 region:rollup2

MENTALITY.

03:07:29.538 --> 03:07:32.141 region:rollup2
AND THEN THOSE STAY IN IN THE

03:07:30.773 --> 03:07:34.543 region:rollup2
GET RELEASED AND THEY DON'T KNOW

03:07:32.141 --> 03:07:35.444 region:rollup2
HOW TO ACT IN SOCIETY BECAUSE IF

CRIME TO GO BACK IN.

03:07:38.347 --> 03:07:43.786 region:rollup2

THERE'S JUST A LOT OF DATA A LOT

03:07:53.462 --> 03:07:56.899 region:rollup2
IN NUMBERS.

03:07:53.763 --> 03:07:58.567 region:rollup2

START TO GET SOMEBODY TO THE

03:08:28.731 --> 03:08:33.235 region:rollup2
POINT WHERE THEY CAN'T STAND

03:08:30.633 --> 03:08:34.203 region:rollup2
TRIAL. ON THEIR MENTAL HEALTH IS

03:08:33.235 --> 03:08:36.705 region:rollup2
THAT THAT.

03:08:34.203 --> 03:08:38.607 region:rollup2
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY FOCUS OUR

03:08:36.705 --> 03:08:40.009 region:rollup2
EFFORTS IN THE RIGHT SPOTS.

03:08:38.607 --> 03:08:41.644 region:rollup2
IT'S TRAGIC THAT WE HAVE A

03:08:40.009 --> 03:08:43.145 region:rollup2
POPULATION OUT THERE NOW.

03:08:41.644 --> 03:08:45.114 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO

03:08:43.145 --> 03:08:47.216 region:rollup2
MANAGE BUT WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK

03:08:45.114 --> 03:08:48.918 region:rollup2
AT. HOW TO DECREASE IT INSTEAD

03:08:47.216 --> 03:08:52.388 region:rollup2
OF CONTINUALLY FIGHTING AT THE

03:08:48.918 --> 03:08:54.190 region:rollup2
WRONG WAY AS IT INCREASES?

03:08:52.388 --> 03:08:55.825 region:rollup2
YOU'VE VERY PHONY ó ABSOLUTELY

03:08:54.190 --> 03:08:57.993 region:rollup2
AGREE MORE AND I THINK. I THINK

03:08:55.825 --> 03:08:59.295 region:rollup2
THIS BUDGET REFLECTS OUR

03:08:57.993 --> 03:09:02.031 region:rollup2
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF YOUR POINT

03:08:59.295 --> 03:09:03.566 region:rollup2
WITCHES WE CAN'T JUST KEEP

03:09:02.031 --> 03:09:04.800 region:rollup2
BUILDING MORE HOSPITAL BEDS TO.

03:09:03.566 --> 03:09:06.335 region:rollup2
RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN

03:09:04.800 --> 03:09:08.070 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS WHO CLEARLY HAVE

03:09:06.335 --> 03:09:09.038 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT PSYCHIATRIC AND

03:09:08.070 --> 03:09:13.442 region:rollup2
SOCIAL ISSUES THAT NEED

03:09:09.038 --> 03:09:13.709 region:rollup2
ADDRESSING TO STOP THE CYCLE.

03:09:13.442 --> 03:09:14.877 region:rollup2
WILK WHO.

03:09:13.709 --> 03:09:18.113 region:rollup2
.

03:09:14.877 --> 03:09:19.348 region:rollup2
I WOULD BE REMISS NOT TO COMMENT

03:09:18.113 --> 03:09:20.449 region:rollup2
ON THE FACT THAT THE STATE HAS

03:09:19.348 --> 03:09:21.550 region:rollup2
INVESTED A FAIR AMOUNT OF

03:09:20.449 --> 03:09:23.519 region:rollup2
RESOURCES INTO THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:09:21.550 --> 03:09:24.753 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

03:09:23.519 --> 03:09:28.090 region:rollup2
AND THAT THE COUNTIES DO HAVE A

03:09:24.753 --> 03:09:29.859 region:rollup2
RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE.

03:09:28.090 --> 03:09:30.960 region:rollup2
OUT PATIENT THE MENTAL HEALTH

03:09:29.859 --> 03:09:33.095 region:rollup2
SERVICES AS WELL AND.

03:09:30.960 --> 03:09:34.930 region:rollup2
.

03:09:33.095 --> 03:09:37.333 region:rollup2
I GUESS THAT REALLY IS THE

03:09:34.930 --> 03:09:37.833 region:rollup2
QUESTION THE PLO HAS PUT IN

03:09:37.333 --> 03:09:39.268 region:rollup2
FRONT OF US IN IS ASKING

03:09:37.833 --> 03:09:41.537 region:rollup2
POLICIES.

03:09:39.268 --> 03:09:44.807 region:rollup2
IS THIS DIVERSION PACKAGING

03:09:41.537 --> 03:09:46.175 region:rollup2
ANYWAY. SUPERIOR TO THE MENTAL

03:09:44.807 --> 03:09:47.910 region:rollup2
HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE

03:09:46.175 --> 03:09:49.979 region:rollup2
COMMUNITIES ARE GETTING THAT.

03:09:47.910 --> 03:09:51.714 region:rollup2
IS THIS MEANT TO SUPPLANT IT TO

03:09:49.979 --> 03:09:54.883 region:rollup2
WORK TO SUPPLEMENT.

03:09:51.714 --> 03:09:57.786 region:rollup2
THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT.

03:09:54.883 --> 03:10:00.122 region:rollup2
AND I ASK. PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT

03:09:57.786 --> 03:10:02.658 region:rollup2
OF HOW MUCH RESERVES THEY HAVE.

03:10:00.122 --> 03:10:05.027 region:rollup2
AND WONDERING WITH WHERE WE ARE

03:10:02.658 --> 03:10:06.495 region:rollup2
TODAY. IF WE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN

03:10:05.027 --> 03:10:08.163 region:rollup2
BETTER SERVED HAVING SPENT SOME

03:10:06.495 --> 03:10:09.665 region:rollup2
OF THOSE RESERVES AND HELPING TO

03:10:08.163 --> 03:10:13.002 region:rollup2
GET UPSTREAM OF SOME OF THESE

03:10:09.665 --> 03:10:14.069 region:rollup2
ISSUES THAT ARE. BEFORE US NOW.

03:10:13.002 --> 03:10:16.739 region:rollup2
I HAVE CONCERNS WHEN I.

03:10:14.069 --> 03:10:18.907 region:rollup2
.

03:10:16.739 --> 03:10:20.909 region:rollup2
SEE THE SCOPE OF THIS PROBLEM

03:10:18.907 --> 03:10:22.912 region:rollup2
AND THE TRAJECTORY THAT WE HAVE

03:10:20.909 --> 03:10:24.780 region:rollup2
TAKEN AS A STATE. THAT IT SEEMS

03:10:22.912 --> 03:10:26.615 region:rollup2
THAT WE HAVE LED A SYMPTOM

03:10:24.780 --> 03:10:27.182 region:rollup2
FASTER FOR AWHILE.

03:10:26.615 --> 03:10:30.352 region:rollup2
AND HAVE GONE UNTREATED THE

03:10:27.182 --> 03:10:33.055 region:rollup2
TRUE.

03:10:30.352 --> 03:10:34.256 region:rollup2
DISEASE PROCESS WHICH IS.

03:10:33.055 --> 03:10:36.158 region:rollup2
THE MENTAL HEALTH CRISIS THAT

03:10:34.256 --> 03:10:36.859 region:rollup2
OUR STATE FACES.

03:10:36.158 --> 03:10:38.093 region:rollup2
AND.

03:10:36.859 --> 03:10:39.795 region:rollup2
THEME UNTREATED MENTAL HEALTH

03:10:38.093 --> 03:10:41.830 region:rollup2
CRISIS.

03:10:39.795 --> 03:10:44.466 region:rollup2
I GUESS THE QUESTION I'M REALLY

03:10:41.830 --> 03:10:46.368 region:rollup2
TRYING TO DO AGAIN IS SPECIFICS

03:10:44.466 --> 03:10:48.671 region:rollup2
OF THE DIVERSION PROGRAM IF I'M.

03:10:46.368 --> 03:10:51.640 region:rollup2
AND I'D LIKE TO.

03:10:48.671 --> 03:10:53.342 region:rollup2
ASK IF I CAN.

03:10:51.640 --> 03:10:55.010 region:rollup2
THE LA WHAT MADE A SUGGESTION

03:10:53.342 --> 03:10:56.245 region:rollup2
ABOUT SIX WEEKS TO THEN BE

03:10:55.010 --> 03:10:57.446 region:rollup2
DEFINED AS BEING ONTO A WAIT

03:10:56.245 --> 03:11:07.323 region:rollup2
LIST.

03:10:57.446 --> 03:11:09.325 region:rollup2
IS THAT A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME.

03:11:07.323 --> 03:11:11.293 region:rollup2
IS.

03:11:09.325 --> 03:11:13.329 region:rollup2
IS THE

03:11:11.293 --> 03:11:16.098 region:rollup2
WEEKS A REASONABLE TIMEFRAME.

03:11:13.329 --> 03:11:18.067 region:rollup2
ETCETERA.

03:11:16.098 --> 03:11:21.003 region:rollup2
AND THEN ALMOST

03:11:18.067 --> 03:11:22.838 region:rollup2
TRYING LEAD YOU DOWN THE PATH.

03:11:21.003 --> 03:11:25.641 region:rollup2
IS THERE AN OPPORTUNITY IN THE

03:11:22.838 --> 03:11:27.343 region:rollup2
FIFTEEN PREVIOUS ARRESTS.

03:11:25.641 --> 03:11:29.311 region:rollup2
BEFORE SOMEONE GETS DEEMED

03:11:27.343 --> 03:11:32.715 region:rollup2
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL. THAT

03:11:29.311 --> 03:11:35.851 region:rollup2
WE HAVE A REAL OPPORTUNITY TO

03:11:32.715 --> 03:11:38.020 region:rollup2
HELP TO DIVERT AND A FEW.

03:11:35.851 --> 03:11:38.821 region:rollup2
WAIT WAIT WAIT WITHOUT I THINK

03:11:38.020 --> 03:11:41.290 region:rollup2

03:11:38.821 --> 03:11:42.858 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSES.

03:11:41.290 --> 03:11:44.927 region:rollup2
ON ON THE WHITE THE MENTAL

03:11:42.858 --> 03:11:47.329 region:rollup2
ILLNESS IS AN AND I HATE TO USE

03:11:44.927 --> 03:11:49.331 region:rollup2
THE TERM NOT WIRED RIGHT.

03:11:47.329 --> 03:11:51.100 region:rollup2
BUT SOME FOLKS.

03:11:49.331 --> 03:11:53.102 region:rollup2
AND CERTAIN ILLNESSES OR JUST AN

03:11:51.100 --> 03:11:55.070 region:rollup2
AUTOMATIC.

03:11:53.102 --> 03:11:56.105 region:rollup2
I MEAN A I HATE TO SAY IT

03:11:55.070 --> 03:11:56.839 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IT'S TRAGIC BUT WHEN I'M

03:11:56.105 --> 03:11:59.441 region:rollup2
IN THERE.

03:11:56.839 --> 03:12:00.342 region:rollup2
THERE ARE CERTAIN THINGS.

03:11:59.441 --> 03:12:00.976 region:rollup2
THEY COULD BE WRONG WITH

03:12:00.342 --> 03:12:02.511 region:rollup2
SOMEBODY WHERE THERE IS NO HOPE

03:12:00.976 --> 03:12:03.712 region:rollup2
FOR THEM

03:12:02.511 --> 03:12:05.981 region:rollup2
THE AND WE HAVE TO PUT THEM IN A

03:12:03.712 --> 03:12:07.583 region:rollup2
SITUATION THAT'S BEST SUITED TO

03:12:05.981 --> 03:12:08.250 region:rollup2
KEEP THEM SAFE AND KEEP SOCIETY

03:12:07.583 --> 03:12:10.586 region:rollup2
SAFE IS WHILE.

.

03:12:10.586 --> 03:12:13.088 region:rollup2
SO WE ALSO NEED TO LOOK AT THAT

03:12:11.453 --> 03:12:14.423 region:rollup2
BECAUSE THERE'S. THERE'S NO

03:12:13.088 --> 03:12:15.491 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF HELP THAT CERTAIN

03:12:14.423 --> 03:12:16.725 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUALS ARE GOING TO GET

03:12:15.491 --> 03:12:17.960 region:rollup2
THAT'S GONNA MAKE THEM READY TO

03:12:16.725 --> 03:12:19.928 region:rollup2
STAND TRIAL.

03:12:17.960 --> 03:12:21.730 region:rollup2
IT'S JUST NOT GONNA HAPPEN IT'S

03:12:19.928 --> 03:12:24.099 region:rollup2
PHYSICALLY IMPOSSIBLE. AND IT'S

03:12:21.730 --> 03:12:25.367 region:rollup2
A REALITY ASSIGNS.

03:12:24.099 --> 03:12:27.169 region:rollup2
AND IN IT IT'S TRAGIC AT THE

03:12:25.367 --> 03:12:29.638 region:rollup2
SAME TIME.

03:12:27.169 --> 03:12:30.572 region:rollup2

03:12:36.111 --> 03:12:38.213 region:rollup2
BUT.

03:12:36.845 --> 03:12:39.681 region:rollup2

COMPARE AND CONTRAST DIFFERENT

03:12:56.865 --> 03:13:00.869 region:rollup2
DIAGNOSIS.

03:13:00.202 --> 03:13:02.704 region:rollup2

A REALLY PRETTY SPREADSHEET

03:13:11.847 --> 03:13:17.219 region:rollup2
UNFORTUNATELY.

03:13:15.951 --> 03:13:19.855 region:rollup2
SORRY I ASKED ABOUT THE SIX

03:13:17.219 --> 03:13:21.990 region:rollup2
WEEKS THOUGH AND WANTED TO SEE

HOW WE COULD HELP TO GET UP ST.

03:13:21.990 --> 03:13:26.762 region:rollup2
SO WITH RESPECT TO THE SIX WEEKS

03:13:24.593 --> 03:13:29.331 region:rollup2
I MEAN COMPRESSION WHAT OF THE

03:13:26.762 --> 03:13:30.099 region:rollup2
LA DOES PROPOSAL IS AN AND

03:13:29.331 --> 03:13:33.502 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND.

03:13:30.099 --> 03:13:35.504 region:rollup2
WHAT THE GOAL IS A THINK AND WE

03:13:33.502 --> 03:13:37.840 region:rollup2
WOULD HAVE A CONCERN WITH AND

03:13:35.504 --> 03:13:39.408 region:rollup2
SIX WEEKS?

03:13:37.840 --> 03:13:40.409 region:rollup2
GIVEN THAT I. AND THEIR YOU

03:13:39.408 --> 03:13:43.612 region:rollup2
KNOW THERE'S A NUMBER OF FACTORS

03:13:40.409 --> 03:13:45.681 region:rollup2
AT PLAY WITH RESPECT TO AND. AS

03:13:43.612 --> 03:13:48.250 region:rollup2
THE THE WAY LESS STAND AND FIRST

03:13:45.681 --> 03:13:50.085 region:rollup2
OF ALL RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A LOT

03:13:48.250 --> 03:13:52.087 region:rollup2
OF TIME IN A BEFORE SOMEBODY IS

03:13:50.085 --> 03:13:54.590 region:rollup2
ADMITTED TO A STATE HOSPITAL AND

03:13:52.087 --> 03:13:55.791 region:rollup2
SO. AND ADD ANDERSON ENDING THAT

03:13:54.590 --> 03:13:57.593 region:rollup2
RIGHT NOW THAT ISN'T THE RATE

03:13:55.791 --> 03:13:59.161 region:rollup2
LIMITING STEP SO THINGS MAY BE

03:13:57.593 --> 03:14:01.330 region:rollup2
TAKING LONGER FOR US TO PROCESS

03:13:59.161 --> 03:14:03.465 region:rollup2
PAPERWORK BECAUSE. WE DON'T NEED

03:14:01.330 --> 03:14:04.933 region:rollup2
TO PROCESS IT TODAY VERSES EIGHT

03:14:03.465 --> 03:14:07.102 region:rollup2
IF WE HAD SORT OF WAIT TIMES

03:14:04.933 --> 03:14:08.804 region:rollup2
THAT DOT PROCESS WOULD GET I'M

03:14:07.102 --> 03:14:11.440 region:rollup2
CONDONES.

03:14:08.804 --> 03:14:12.074 region:rollup2
WRITTEN FIFTY TWO DAYS I THINK

03:14:11.440 --> 03:14:13.475 region:rollup2
THAT'S HOW MANY DAYS HE SAID THE

03:14:12.074 --> 03:14:14.476 region:rollup2
AVERAGE.

03:14:13.475 --> 03:14:15.410 region:rollup2
INCOMPETENT TO STAND TRIAL IS ON

03:14:14.476 --> 03:14:16.178 region:rollup2
THE WAITING LIST IS THAT

03:14:15.410 --> 03:14:18.814 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE OR WHAT IS AN

03:14:16.178 --> 03:14:19.381 region:rollup2
ACCEPTABLE.

03:14:18.814 --> 03:14:21.250 region:rollup2
AMOUNT OF TIME AND.

03:14:19.381 --> 03:14:23.252 region:rollup2
AND.

03:14:21.250 --> 03:14:23.986 region:rollup2
AND THAT'S UP FOR DEBATE WITH

03:14:23.252 --> 03:14:26.822 region:rollup2
THE COURTS RIGHT NOW.

03:14:23.986 --> 03:14:28.891 region:rollup2
SO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE WE

03:14:26.822 --> 03:14:29.658 region:rollup2
ARE ARE CHALLENGED IS WE DON'T

03:14:28.891 --> 03:14:33.095 region:rollup2
HAVE ANY.

03:14:29.658 --> 03:14:35.030 region:rollup2
A ARE VERY CLEAR.

03:14:33.095 --> 03:14:37.065 region:rollup2
.

03:14:35.030 --> 03:14:39.268 region:rollup2
GUIDANCE FROM ON THIS BECAUSE

03:14:37.065 --> 03:14:40.936 region:rollup2
ULTIMATELY THE WE HAVE BEEN

03:14:39.268 --> 03:14:42.304 region:rollup2
PRIOR UNDER PRIOR COURT

03:14:40.936 --> 03:14:44.139 region:rollup2
DIRECTION TO ADMIT INDIVIDUALS

03:14:42.304 --> 03:14:47.242 region:rollup2
WITHIN THIRTY DAYS.

03:14:44.139 --> 03:14:49.111 region:rollup2
WHO NATIONALLY WE HAVE BEEN YOU

03:14:47.242 --> 03:14:50.846 region:rollup2
KNOW SEEN FEDERAL COURT CASES

03:14:49.111 --> 03:14:52.114 region:rollup2
RESULT IN INDIVIDUAL AND

03:14:50.846 --> 03:14:54.783 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS BEING BEING REQUIRED

03:14:52.114 --> 03:14:55.484 region:rollup2
TO ADMIT WITHIN SEVEN DAYS? AND

03:14:54.783 --> 03:14:57.452 region:rollup2
SO.

03:14:55.484 --> 03:14:59.988 region:rollup2
AND WE ARE CONSTANTLY.

03:14:57.452 --> 03:15:01.657 region:rollup2
BEING BROUGHT BEFORE THE COURTS

03:14:59.988 --> 03:15:04.026 region:rollup2
ON ORDERS TO SHOW CAUSE.

03:15:01.657 --> 03:15:05.661 region:rollup2
WERE IN COURTS DEAL ONLY.

03:15:04.026 --> 03:15:07.796 region:rollup2
AND WHEN WE NEED BECAUSE WE ARE

03:15:05.661 --> 03:15:09.331 region:rollup2
NOT ADMITTING INDIVIDUALS TIMELY

03:15:07.796 --> 03:15:11.200 region:rollup2
AND WE'VE BEEN UNDER COURT

03:15:09.331 --> 03:15:11.800 region:rollup2
ORDERS FROM ANYWHERE FROM TWO

03:15:11.200 --> 03:15:14.369 region:rollup2
WEEKS TO SIXTY DAYS OURSELVES

03:15:11.800 --> 03:15:15.904 region:rollup2
SO.

03:15:14.369 --> 03:15:18.407 region:rollup2
I THINK CITING AS A SIX WEEK

03:15:15.904 --> 03:15:19.775 region:rollup2
TIME FRAME DOESN'T NECESSARILY

03:15:18.407 --> 03:15:21.643 region:rollup2
RECOGNIZE THAT THAT KIND A

03:15:19.775 --> 03:15:23.145 region:rollup2
DYNAMIC THAT WERE IN WITH WITH

03:15:21.643 --> 03:15:25.347 region:rollup2
RESPECT TO THE CORE I'M BUT WE'D

03:15:23.145 --> 03:15:27.883 region:rollup2
BE HAPPY THAT YOU KNOW CONTINUE

THERE'S SOMETHING THAT DOES MAKE

03:15:28.750 --> 03:15:31.820 region:rollup2
SENSE AND.

03:15:30.085 --> 03:15:35.257 region:rollup2
I WANT TO GET THE LA DOES.

03:15:31.820 --> 03:15:36.525 region:rollup2
REASONING BEHIND BY WE HAD SIX

03:15:35.257 --> 03:15:38.527 region:rollup2
WEEKS. WRONG BUT DO WANT TO

03:15:36.525 --> 03:15:40.128 region:rollup2
FOCUS THE CONVERSATION FOR THE

03:15:38.527 --> 03:15:41.897 region:rollup2
REMAINDER OF TODAY IF I CAN ON

03:15:40.128 --> 03:15:44.132 region:rollup2
THE DIVERSION PROGRAM. THAT'S

03:15:41.897 --> 03:15:48.203 region:rollup2
BEFORE US TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN

03:15:44.132 --> 03:15:48.370 region:rollup2
HAVE AS MUCH INPUT INTO IT AS WE

03:15:48.203 --> 03:15:49.238 region:rollup2
CAN.

03:15:48.370 --> 03:15:51.206 region:rollup2

03:15:51.206 --> 03:15:54.409 region:rollup2
DON'T KNOW HOW TO SAY THIS.

03:15:52.808 --> 03:15:56.245 region:rollup2
WITHOUT JUST JUMPING TO IT.

03:15:54.409 --> 03:15:58.447 region:rollup2
.

03:15:56.245 --> 03:16:01.149 region:rollup2
THAT MANY OF THE MEMBER

03:15:58.447 --> 03:16:02.951 region:rollup2
PROPOSALS WE HEARD HAD.

03:16:01.149 --> 03:16:04.253 region:rollup2

THANK YOU MISTER SHARIA OF WITH

WITH RESPECT TO THIS SIX WEEK

03:16:34.783 --> 03:16:39.087 region:rollup2
TIME PERIOD WE AGREE THAT THERE

03:16:37.052 --> 03:16:39.855 region:rollup2
THERE ARE ALTERNATIVE WAYS TO

03:16:39.087 --> 03:16:41.523 region:rollup2
DEFINE THE WILL BE THE

03:16:39.855 --> 03:16:43.959 region:rollup2
WEIGHTLESS IN A WAY THAT REALLY

03:16:41.523 --> 03:16:45.694 region:rollup2
SEPARATES THE PROBLEM OF.

03:16:43.959 --> 03:16:46.495 region:rollup2
PROCESSING PEOPLE TO DETERMINE

03:16:45.694 --> 03:16:48.163 region:rollup2
THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT

03:16:46.495 --> 03:16:50.365 region:rollup2
LOCATION WITH.

03:16:48.163 --> 03:16:52.100 region:rollup2
OUR OUR OTHER PROBLEMS OF NOT

HAVING ENOUGH CAPACITY.

03:16:52.100 --> 03:16:55.537 region:rollup2
AND SO TRYING TO FOCUS IN ON HOW

03:16:54.236 --> 03:16:57.072 region:rollup2
MANY PEOPLE ARE ON THAT WAY LESS

03:16:55.537 --> 03:16:58.874 region:rollup2
BECAUSE WE REALLY DON'T HAVE

03:16:57.072 --> 03:17:01.143 region:rollup2
CAPACITY AND WHAT. CHANGES TO

03:16:58.874 --> 03:17:02.210 region:rollup2
CAPACITY DO WE NEED TO DO IN

03:17:01.143 --> 03:17:03.311 region:rollup2
ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY GET

03:17:02.210 --> 03:17:04.379 region:rollup2
INTO TREATMENT AT THE

03:17:03.311 --> 03:17:06.114 region:rollup2
APPROPRIATE TREATMENT AS QUICKLY

03:17:04.379 --> 03:17:07.215 region:rollup2
AS POSSIBLE.

03:17:06.114 --> 03:17:09.084 region:rollup2
WERE OPEN TO DISCUSSING

03:17:07.215 --> 03:17:09.918 region:rollup2
ALTERNATIVES TO THE SIX WEEK

03:17:09.084 --> 03:17:11.853 region:rollup2
TIME PERIOD WE WANTED TO MAKE

03:17:09.918 --> 03:17:13.188 region:rollup2
SURE. THAT THE DEPARTMENT HAD A

03:17:11.853 --> 03:17:13.989 region:rollup2
SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF TIME TO DO

03:17:13.188 --> 03:17:15.824 region:rollup2
THE WORK THEY NEEDED TO DO TO

03:17:13.989 --> 03:17:17.859 region:rollup2
MAKE SURE THERE.

03:17:15.824 --> 03:17:18.860 region:rollup2
IN THE RIGHT PROGRAM BECAUSE.

03:17:17.859 --> 03:17:19.528 region:rollup2
WE CERTAINLY WOULDN'T WANT TO BE

03:17:18.860 --> 03:17:20.595 region:rollup2
IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE

03:17:19.528 --> 03:17:21.997 region:rollup2
RUSHING PEOPLE INTO THE WRONG

03:17:20.595 --> 03:17:23.699 region:rollup2
PROGRAM.

03:17:21.997 --> 03:17:25.967 region:rollup2
AND SOURCES

03:17:23.699 --> 03:17:27.669 region:rollup2
IF IT'S SIX WEEKS OR SIXTY DAYS

03:17:25.967 --> 03:17:29.004 region:rollup2
IF THE COURT CAME IN AND SAID

03:17:27.669 --> 03:17:30.072 region:rollup2
THERE'S ANOTHER STANDARD. OUR

03:17:29.004 --> 03:17:31.473 region:rollup2
GOAL IS JUST TO MAKE SURE WE

03:17:30.072 --> 03:17:32.974 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS SO THAT

03:17:31.473 --> 03:17:35.610 region:rollup2
WE CAN FOCUS.

03:17:32.974 --> 03:17:36.945 region:rollup2
THE LIMITED RESOURCES WE HAVE ON

03:17:35.610 --> 03:17:38.380 region:rollup2
THAT PROBLEM RATHER THAN TRY TO.

03:17:36.945 --> 03:17:39.614 region:rollup2
ON TACKLE WEIGHTLESS THAT WE'RE

03:17:38.380 --> 03:17:40.282 region:rollup2
NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO

03:17:39.614 --> 03:17:42.818 region:rollup2
ELIMINATE BECAUSE WILL NEED SOME

03:17:40.282 --> 03:17:44.419 region:rollup2
PROCESSING.

03:17:42.818 --> 03:17:46.555 region:rollup2
EARLIER WE HAD HEARD FROM

03:17:44.419 --> 03:17:47.956 region:rollup2
DISABILITY RIGHTS OF A DIVERSION

03:17:46.555 --> 03:17:49.458 region:rollup2

MISDEMEANORS.

03:17:49.458 --> 03:17:53.895 region:rollup2
WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD SPEAK

03:17:50.959 --> 03:17:55.397 region:rollup2
TO THE SUCCESS OF THAT PROGRAM.

03:17:53.895 --> 03:17:57.099 region:rollup2
AND IF THAT'S SOMETHING WE AS A

03:17:55.397 --> 03:17:57.599 region:rollup2
STATE ARE LOOKING OUT

03:17:57.099 --> 03:18:01.136 region:rollup2
CONSIDERING THIS CURRENT

03:17:57.599 --> 03:18:04.005 region:rollup2
TEMPERATURE.

03:18:01.136 --> 03:18:05.373 region:rollup2
ON OCCASION ACTUALLY VISITED

03:18:04.005 --> 03:18:07.175 region:rollup2
THAT PROGRAM DO ON A TALK ABOUT

03:18:05.373 --> 03:18:07.843 region:rollup2
IT A LITTLE BIT. YEAH AND I

03:18:07.175 --> 03:18:08.477 region:rollup2
THINK MAYBE I CAN LIVE TO SINCE

03:18:07.843 --> 03:18:10.912 region:rollup2
HERE EARLIER QUESTION ABOUT THE

03:18:08.477 --> 03:18:12.414 region:rollup2
FLEXIBILITY. I'M AND AND ALSO

03:18:10.912 --> 03:18:14.416 region:rollup2

FUNDS FOR DIVERSION LA ALL

03:18:16.318 --> 03:18:20.288 region:rollup2
QUESTIONS THAT WE'VE GOT ALL

03:18:17.919 --> 03:18:21.890 region:rollup2
GREAT QUESTIONS AND I THINK. AND

03:18:20.288 --> 03:18:23.525 region:rollup2
REALLY THE ANSWER IS WE KNOW THE

03:18:21.890 --> 03:18:25.761 region:rollup2
PATIENT POPULATION WE'VE BEEN

03:18:23.525 --> 03:18:27.729 region:rollup2
STUDYING THE PATIENT POPULATION.

03:18:25.761 --> 03:18:29.965 region:rollup2
WE UNDERSTAND WHO THESE FOLKS

03:18:27.729 --> 03:18:33.068 region:rollup2
ARE AND WHERE UNDERSTANDING MORE

03:18:29.965 --> 03:18:34.069 region:rollup2
AND MORE EVERYDAY ABOUT THE

03:18:33.068 --> 03:18:35.570 region:rollup2
COURSE THAT THERE.

03:18:34.069 --> 03:18:36.471 region:rollup2
I TRAVERSING TO COME TO US WOULD

03:18:35.570 --> 03:18:37.606 region:rollup2
LIKE NOTHING MORE THAN TO SHUT

03:18:36.471 --> 03:18:39.474 region:rollup2
OUR DOORS AND CLOSE DOWN DUE TO

03:18:37.606 --> 03:18:41.510 region:rollup2
LACK OF BUSINESS. AND TO SEE ALL

03:18:39.474 --> 03:18:43.278 region:rollup2
THESE FOLKS SUCCESSFULLY

03:18:41.510 --> 03:18:46.848 region:rollup2
TRANSITION TO THE COMMUNITY.

03:18:43.278 --> 03:18:48.884 region:rollup2
THAT COUNTIES HAVE VARIOUS

03:18:46.848 --> 03:18:52.621 region:rollup2
DIFFERENCE.

03:18:48.884 --> 03:18:54.689 region:rollup2
A DIVERSION PRACTICES IN PLACE.

03:18:52.621 --> 03:18:56.324 region:rollup2
THE CONCEPT OF JAIL DIVERSION IS

03:18:54.689 --> 03:18:57.692 region:rollup2
A FAIRLY WELL STUDIED WELL

03:18:56.324 --> 03:18:59.461 region:rollup2
ARTICULATED.

03:18:57.692 --> 03:19:01.496 region:rollup2
CONSTRUCT.

03:18:59.461 --> 03:19:03.064 region:rollup2
WHERE YOU CAN HAVE DIVERSION AT

03:19:01.496 --> 03:19:04.933 region:rollup2
ANY NUMBER OF POINTS WHERE AN

03:19:03.064 --> 03:19:05.467 region:rollup2
INDIVIDUAL COMES INTO CONTACT

03:19:04.933 --> 03:19:06.701 region:rollup2
WITH THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

03:19:05.467 --> 03:19:07.636 region:rollup2
SYSTEM?

03:19:06.701 --> 03:19:09.404 region:rollup2
AYE THERE HAVE BEEN.

03:19:07.636 --> 03:19:11.339 region:rollup2
NATIONAL STEPPING UP

03:19:09.404 --> 03:19:13.241 region:rollup2
INITIATIVES THE COUNCIL ON STATE

03:19:11.339 --> 03:19:15.644 region:rollup2
GOVERNMENTS AND CERTAIN COUNTIES

03:19:13.241 --> 03:19:16.912 region:rollup2
IN CALIFORNIA HAVE QUOTE UNQUOTE

03:19:15.644 --> 03:19:20.015 region:rollup2
STEPPED UP TO TRY TO.

03:19:16.912 --> 03:19:20.515 region:rollup2
REDUCE THE NUMBER OF A MENTAL

03:19:20.015 --> 03:19:21.316 region:rollup2
HEALTH PATIENTS WHO ARE

INCARCERATED.

03:19:21.316 --> 03:19:24.452 region:rollup2
SO WE DO SEE AND WE'VE BEEN ON A

03:19:24.219 --> 03:19:26.755 region:rollup2
LITTLE.

03:19:24.452 --> 03:19:28.924 region:rollup2
NUMBER FIELD TRIPS LOOKING A

03:19:26.755 --> 03:19:30.692 region:rollup2
COUNTIES HAVE IN PLACE WE DO SEE

03:19:28.924 --> 03:19:33.094 region:rollup2
COLLABORATIVE COURTS WE DO SEE

03:19:30.692 --> 03:19:35.730 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE THE MISDEMEANOR ICED

03:19:33.094 --> 03:19:37.766 region:rollup2
TEA PROGRAM IN IN LOS ANGELES

03:19:35.730 --> 03:19:39.434 region:rollup2
WHICH IS EXTREMELY IMPRESSIVE.

03:19:37.766 --> 03:19:41.336 region:rollup2
WE SEE.

03:19:39.434 --> 03:19:42.437 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW.

03:19:41.336 --> 03:19:43.071 region:rollup2
GOTTA COUNTIES THAT ARE STARTING

03:19:42.437 --> 03:19:44.372 region:rollup2
OUT THE CLEVER OF COURT MODEL

03:19:43.071 --> 03:19:47.676 region:rollup2
BUT DON'T HAVE THE PLACE TO

03:19:44.372 --> 03:19:50.312 region:rollup2
DIVERT TO SAID THERE'S. VARIOUS.

03:19:47.676 --> 03:19:52.347 region:rollup2
DIVERSION EFFORTS BASED ON

03:19:50.312 --> 03:19:53.882 region:rollup2
VARIOUS COUNTY NEEDS IN VARIOUS

03:19:52.347 --> 03:19:55.484 region:rollup2
COUNTY RESOURCES THAT ARE SORT

03:19:53.882 --> 03:19:57.752 region:rollup2
OF BEING STOOD UP.

03:19:55.484 --> 03:20:01.056 region:rollup2
AYE AND THE FLEXIBILITY THAT'S

03:19:57.752 --> 03:20:03.825 region:rollup2
IN THEIR LANGUAGE IS TO ALLOW.

03:20:01.056 --> 03:20:05.427 region:rollup2
US TO SUPPORT THOSE EFFORTS AND

03:20:03.825 --> 03:20:07.162 region:rollup2
GET THE COUNTIES TO THE PLACE.

03:20:05.427 --> 03:20:09.364 region:rollup2
WHERE THEY CAN START DIVERTING

03:20:07.162 --> 03:20:11.132 region:rollup2
MORE OF THE FOLKS THAT WE

03:20:09.364 --> 03:20:12.334 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND USING THESE

03:20:11.132 --> 03:20:13.869 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS THAT ARE ALREADY

03:20:12.334 --> 03:20:15.270 region:rollup2
BEING DEVELOPED IF THAT MAKES

03:20:13.869 --> 03:20:17.305 region:rollup2
SENSE SO THAT BECAUSE WE

03:20:15.270 --> 03:20:17.472 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND THE POPULATION? CAN

03:20:17.305 --> 03:20:19.074 region:rollup2
WE.

03:20:17.472 --> 03:20:20.609 region:rollup2
.

03:20:19.074 --> 03:20:21.943 region:rollup2
ROOT BEER OR RETOOL THE

03:20:20.609 --> 03:20:23.378 region:rollup2
MECHANISMS THEY HAVE A PLACE TO

03:20:21.943 --> 03:20:25.013 region:rollup2
TARGET THE POPULATION THAT WE

03:20:23.378 --> 03:20:27.082 region:rollup2
UNDERSTAND SO WELL AND IN ORDER

03:20:25.013 --> 03:20:28.917 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT NECESSARILY THERE HAS

03:20:27.082 --> 03:20:31.853 region:rollup2
TO BE SOME FLEXIBILITY.

03:20:28.917 --> 03:20:34.956 region:rollup2
I AND AND WE'RE HOPING THAT.

03:20:31.853 --> 03:20:37.325 region:rollup2

INTO LONG TERM COMMUNITY

03:20:55.210 --> 03:20:59.748 region:rollup2
SERVICES AYE WE WERE HOPING THAT

03:20:57.546 --> 03:21:01.883 region:rollup2
THAT COMBINATION OF FLEXIBILITY

03:20:59.748 --> 03:21:04.286 region:rollup2
IN COLLABORATION AROUND HOW. AND

03:21:01.883 --> 03:21:05.387 region:rollup2
AND ACCOUNTABILITY AROUND THE

03:21:04.286 --> 03:21:06.788 region:rollup2
OUTCOMES WOULD.

03:21:05.387 --> 03:21:08.290 region:rollup2
TO BE THE BEST WAY TO APPROACH

03:21:06.788 --> 03:21:08.957 region:rollup2
DIVERSION IF THAT MAKES ANY

03:21:08.290 --> 03:21:11.192 region:rollup2

OVER THE MONEY GOING OUT BUT

03:21:58.673 --> 03:22:00.942 region:rollup2
