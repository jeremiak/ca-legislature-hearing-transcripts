SOMETHING THAT HAS SHOCKED ARE ORANGE COUNTY IN ASIAN AMERICAN COMMUNITIES. WHILE CELEBRATING THE OVERSEAS RETURN OF THEIR FORMER PASTOR CONGREGANTS OF THE TAIWANESE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH GATHERED AT GENEVA PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH IN LAGUNA WOODS. FOR WHAT WAS EXPECTED TO BE AN AFTERNOON LUNCHEON OF HAPPINESS HOPE AND FAITH. AND FOR THOSE WHO ARE UNFAMILIAR WITH LAGUNA WOODS IT'S A SMALL SLEEPY RETIREMENT COMMUNITY- EVERYONE KNOWS EACH OTHER- THE IDEA THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS WOULD HAPPEN IN A HOUSE OF WORSHIP IN A CHURCH. IN LAGUNA WOODS I THINK- IS TERRIFYING AND ANYTHING TO DO SOMETHING THAT HAS REALLY SHOCKED OUR COMMUNITIES- IF IT CAN HAPPEN IN LAGUNA WOODS IT CAN AND WILL HAPPEN AS WE'VE SEEN IN ANYWHERE- AND THE SPECTER OF GUN VIOLENCE OF HATE IS SOMETHING THAT- I KNOW IT'S JUST BEEN- IS SOMETHING THAT HAS AS REALLY DISTURB SO MANY MEMBERS. OF OUR COMMUNITY. WHAT UNFOLDED NEXT WAS ABSOLUTELY HEARTBREAKING A LONE WOLF EXTREMIST INFILTRATORS CELEBRATION- BEGAN FIRING INTO THE CROWD OF ELDERLY PRISONERS. BY ACTING QUICKLY DR CHANG DID NOT TRY TO RUN OR TAKE COVER HE SPRUNG TO ACTION AS OTHERS IN THE ROOM TOOK FIRE. OR SEARCH FOR COVER DR CHANG CHARGES THE SHOOTER TRYING TO DISARM HIM AND IN THE ENSUING SCUFFLE. AS THIS SEQUENCE GUN JAMMED- DR CHANG WAS ABLE TO HELP TAKE HIM DOWN ALTHOUGH HE WAS MORTALLY WOUNDED IN THE PROCESS. NOW THIS GUNMAN HAD CHAINED THE DOORS SUPER GLUED THE LOCKS AND HATED MOLOTOV COCKTAILS THROUGHOUT THIS SO SOCIAL HALL. HIT METICULOUSLY WORKED OUT A SCHEME TO INFLICT THE MOST DAMAGE POSSIBLE AND EXECUTE AS MANY PEOPLE AS HE COULD. WITNESSES SAY THAT WAS BECAUSE OF JOHN'S BRAVERY HIS ACT OF COURAGE THAT THE FELLOW ATTENDEES COULD TAKE CONTROL AND SUBDUE THE SHOOTER. WHEN I'M COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT ARRIVED THEY FOUND THE SHOOTER HOGTIED WITH ELECTRICAL WIRES. AND DISARMED AND IT WAS DUE TO DOCTOR JOHN CHANG'S BRAVERY WHO SACRIFICED HIS ACTIVE OF UNSELFISHNESS- THAT HE THE SHOOTER WAS TAKEN DOWN AND- THIS WAS INDICATIVE OF WHO JOHN CHIANG WAS- THIS MAN WAS A DOCTOR. A HEALER AMANTS OKAY STERN WITH SAFEGUARDING THE REACT.
