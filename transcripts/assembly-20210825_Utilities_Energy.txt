LIKE TO CALL TO ORDER THIS- HEARING TODAY ON BUILDING DECARBONIZATION AN INFORMAL HEARING BY THE ASSEMBLY UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE- I WOULD LIKE TO CALL IT TO ORDER AND WE WERE WE'RE HERE FOR THIS INFORMATIONAL HERE TO DISCUSS BUILDING DECARBONIZATION FOCUSING SQUARELY ON EFFORTS TO DECARBONISE CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING. BUILDINGS BEFORE WE% BEGAN I HAVE SOME HOUSEKEEPING TO GO OVER WE ARE WEARING MASKS AT ALL TIMES HERE IN THE CHAMBER. AND THROUGHOUT THE CAPITOL BUILDING. WE ARE ALSO REQUIRED MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC TO SOCIALLY DISTANCE WHILE INSIDE THE CAPITOL WE HAVE VERY LIMITED SPACE SO OUR PALACE WILL BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY WE ENCOURAGE THOSE WHO ARE WATCHING THE CALL IN DURING THE PUBLIC COMMENT SEGMENT OF THIS HEARING THE CALL IN NUMBER FOR THIS HEARING IS EIGHT SEVEN SEVEN. SIX NINE TWO EIGHT NINE FIVE SEVEN AND THE ACCESS CODE IS. TWO FOUR TWO SIX TWO THREE SEVEN YOU CAN ALSO FIND THIS NUMBER ON THE ASSEMBLY UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE WEBSITE AS WELL AS ON THE TV SCREEN. ADDITION I WILL MAINTAIN DECORUM DURING THE HEARING AS IS CUSTOMARY IN ORDER TO HEAR AS MUCH FROM THE PUBLIC. WITHIN THE TIME AT A TIME WE HAVE. WE WILL NOT PERMIT CONDUCT THAT DISRUPTS OR OTHERWISE IMPEDE THE ORDERLY CONDUCT. OF LEGISLATIVE PROCEEDINGS. AN INDIVIDUAL WHO IS DISRUPTIVE WILL BE REMOVED FROM THE CHAMBER OR REMOTE MEETING SERVICE OR HAVE THEIR CONNECTIONS MUTED WE'RE HERE ARE HOLDING THIS HEARING TODAY AS CALIFORNIA AND THE WORLD GRAPPLES WITH A NEW CLIMATE REALITY. THE U. N. RECENTLY RELEASED THEIR REPORT AGAIN ALERTING US THAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS WIDESPREAD. AND RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING AND WE EXPERIENCED THIS FIRSTHAND AS VAST AREAS OF OUR STATE AND COUNTY AND COUNTRY BURN THE UN REPORT IS GRAHAM BUT PROVIDES HOPE IF WE ACT URGENTLY. WE MUST CONTNUE TO PUSH FORWARD IN OUR FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE WITH GREATER RESOLVE. THE STATE HAS ALREADY ACTED URGENTLY TO CUT EMISSIONS FROM MANY SECTORS WE'RE BRINGING MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES ONLINE AND PAVING THE PATH FOR ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. OVER THE DECADES WE HAVE PRIORITIZE ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN BUILDINGS AND APPLIANCES LEADING TO REDUCTIONS IN THE BUILDING SECTOR. BUT THIS IS NOT ENOUGH. TODAY OUR HEARING WILL FOCUS ON WHAT MORE IS NEEDED TO REDUCE EMISSIONS IN THE BUILDING SECTOR WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR ROUGHLY A QUARTER OF OUR STATE'S GHG EMISSIONS. IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT WE REDUCE THESE EMISSIONS IN ORDER TO MEET OUR STATE'S CLIMATE GOALS WE WILL LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT EFFORTS AND CHALLENGES AROUND EXISTING BUILDINGS. WHICH ARE DISTINCT FROM THE PROGRESS MADE BY LOCAL AND STATE AUTHORITIES TO ELECTRIFIED NEW CONSTRUCTION THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION TO MAKE. THE WORK AROUND NEW CONSTRUCTION IS THE FIRST STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA. FOR MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS OLD. BY TWENTY THIRTY ONLY A SMALL FRACTION OF THE STATE'S BUILDINGS WILL HAVE BEEN BUILT WITH TODAY'S ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS SO THE QUESTION TODAY IS HOW CAN WE REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM OUR EXISTING BUILDINGS AND WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES AHEAD WE ARE HONORED TO HAVE YOUR LOOSE RIVAS OF THE ASSEMBLY NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE TO JOIN US IN THE DISCUSSION TODAY AND FOR HER CARE AND ATTENTION TO THESE ISSUES. I WOULD LIKE NOW TO WELCOME SURE RIVAS FOR HER OPENING REMARKS. THANK YOU CHAIR HOLDEN AND TO YOUR TEAM FOR PUTTING TOGETHER THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING. ON DECARBONISATION AND ALSO PROVIDING MEMBERS OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE TO PARTICIPATE. AS CHAIR OF THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE ON NATURAL RESOURCES I'M COMMITTED TO MITIGATING THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE. IMPROVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND EXPANDING OUR RENEWABLE ENERGY PORTFOLIO HE'S TO BE HERE BECAUSE I THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT AND TIMELY DISCUSSION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE OUR AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS WE HAVE TO TAKE BOLD ACTIONS AND WE MUST BEGIN OR CONTINUE TO DEPARTMENT DECARBONIZE OUR EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. WE DON'T HAVE ANY TIME TO WASTE. CURRENTLY AROUND A QUARTER OF OUR STATE'S TOTAL GREENHOUSE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS COME FROM EXISTING BUILDINGS AND THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE UPGRADES AND IMPROVEMENTS IN THIS SECTOR MUST BE MADE OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY MUST BE IMPROVED OUR SOURCES OF ENERGY THAT POWER THESE BUILDINGS MUST BE CLEAN AND RELIABLE. AND ARE ACTIONS MRS STAIN ARE LONG TERM CLIMATE GOALS. WERE WELL POSITIONED TO MAKE THESE INVESTMENTS AND WE SHOULD BE WE CANNOT ACHIEVE OUR CLIMATE GOALS WITHOUT DECARBONISING OUR EXISTING BUILDINGS. I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PANELISTS ON HOW WE SHOULD MOVE FORWARD AND HOW MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE CAN BE HELPFUL IN OVERCOMING ANY EXISTING CHALLENGES THANK YOU AGAIN FOR- INVITING ME TO PARTICIPATE. BUDGETARY WITH NOW I'D LIKE TO WELCOME OUR PANELISTS I'VE INVITED THE PALACE TO KEEP THEIR REMARKS BRIEF TO ALLOW MORE TIME FOR QUESTIONS AFTER THE PRESENTATIONS FIRST UP WE HAVE COMMISSIONER ANDREW MCALLISTER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. WHO WILL PROVIDE THE FOUNDATION FOR THIS YEAR AND BY DISCUSSING FINDINGS FROM THE INTERVIEW COMMISSION'S RECENT AB THIRTY TWO THIRTY TO REPORT. WELCOME COMMISSIONER. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TERRY HOLDEN HOPEFULLY YOU CAN HEAR ME OKAY WE CAN WE CAN HEAR YOU JUST WELL THANK YOU EXCELLENT EXCELLENT- SO I WANT TO THANK YOU. FOR PUTTING THIS YEAR TOGETHER IT'S VERY- GREAT TO HEAR THAT THE RECOGNITION OF THE ESSENTIAL NATURE OF OUR EXISTING BUILDINGS- AND THE AND HOW CRITICAL THEY ARE TO MEETING OUR CLIMATE GOALS I WILL BE BRIEF THERE'S A LOT TO COVER IN- IN THIS- PRESENTATION- AND I WILL. TRY TO DO IT AS EFFICIENTLY AS I CAN SO- I WOULD LIKE TO- FIRST HIGHLIGHT ASSEMBLY BILL THIRTY TWO THIRTY TWO- THAT IS A- BILLS ASSEMBLY MEMBER TREATMENT FROM SOME IN A FEW YEARS AGO AND WE JUST THAT. TRANSMITTED THE REPORT TO THE ASSEMBLY SO I'M REALLY HAPPY TO HAVE IT HIGHLIGHTED HERE TODAY. SO THE MANDATES.OF THE ASSEMBLY BILL I WAS TO- ASSESS THE POTENTIAL TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM OUR BUILDING STOCK RIGHT LEAST 40% BELOW NINETEEN NINETY LEVELS BY. TWENTY THIRTY. AND SO IT REALLY BRINGS OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE PATHWAYS THAT WILL MAKE THE STOP- ACHIEVABLE- WHAT PATHWAYS WE NEED TO WALK DOWN. TO ACTUALLY. MAKE THAT HAPPEN AND IT IT SOME COSTA STRATEGY TO COST ANALYSIS LOOK AT THESE PATHWAYS WITH A CRITICAL EYE I WOULD NOTE THAT- ANOTHER BILL FROM MY TWO THOUSAND NINE NANCY SKINNER- WHEN SHE WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY AB TWO SEVEN FIFTY EIGHT WE'VE GOT SEVERAL ITERATIONS OF THAT REPORTER THAT PLAN WHICH IS AN EXISTING BUILDING ENERGY EFFICIENCY STRATEGY FOR THE STATE SO THAT ALSO EXISTS WE'VE BEEN DRAWN ON THAT. AS WELL SO BUILDINGS AND BUILDING EMISSIONS AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY R. G. COMPLIMENTS KEY COMPONENTS TO THIS PROGRESS- AS YOU BOTH SAID SYSTEM OUR BUILDINGS EMISSIONS ARE 25% OF THE TOTAL IN THE STATE. OF THOSE A LITTLE LESS THAN HALF FOR DIRECT EMISSIONS AND SO THAT IS ONSITE COMBUSTION AND REFRIGERANTS THERE A MINUTE AFTER AT EACH BUILDING SO WE'VE LOOKED AT- THE LEGISLATION SUGGEST BOTH OF THOSE AS ORGANIZING PRINCIPLES WE LOOK AT MOST OF BOTH OF THOSE ASK BASED. ON THE DIFFERENCES ACTUALLY- IMPORTANT SO THAT ONE OF THE KEY TAKEAWAYS THAT ENERGY EFFICIENCY MAIN- CONTINUES TO BE CRUCIAL- IS A KEY GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION STRATEGY AND IT'S A STRATEGY TO. OPTIMIZE OUR OUR OVERALL STATEWIDE PATHWAY TO LOWER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND SECONDLY HIGHLY EFFICIENT ELECTRIC APPLIANCES IN PARTICULAR HE POPS ARE CRITICAL ESSENTIAL TO MEETING THE STATE'S CLEAN ENERGY AND CHRONICLES. LEVERAGING THE FACT THAT THE ELECTRIC SYSTEM IS ALREADY RAPIDLY DECARBONIZING AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR OUR PS AND SB ONE HUNDRED GOALS SO I'LL JUST GO OVER SOME CONCLUSIONS OF THE ASSESSMENT HERE- THE DO WE REALLY THINK IT'S- I'M SORRY THIS IS A- SORRY THIS HE'S GOT MIXED UP SOMEWHERE I'M NOT SURE HOW THAT HAPPENED BUT SORRY I MUST HAVE PUT AN END TO THEIR BY ACCIDENT SORRY ABOUT THAT NO PRO- YEP. OKAY AREA SO WE HAD AN THE REPORT ANALYZES SEVEN BROAD STRATEGIES SO ELECTRIFICATION IS REALLY PRINCIPLE AMONG THEM AND YOU'LL HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT FROM THE OTHER SPEAKERS FOR SURE. DECARBONISING ELECTRICITY GENERATIONS MENTIONED THAT ALREADY IT'S CRITICAL. DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES CAN PROVIDE ADDITIONAL. REDUCTIONS IN GREENHOUSE GAS- A LOT OF THAT BUILDING CODES AND THERE ARE LOTS OF STATE PROGRAMS AND BEEN A PLACE FOR SOME TIME ON THAT FRONT. REFRIGERANT CONVERSION OVER TO LOWER GWP GREEN GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL FOR DRESS AND REDUCING LEAKAGE OF REFRIGERANTS IS ALSO A KEY STRATEGY AND WE ASSESS THE BAT IN THE REPORT AN INTEGRAL WAY. ENERGY EFFICIENCY AS A- CONTINUES TO BE RIGHT THERE AT THE TOP OF THE LOADING ORDER AND IT'S. ALSO JUST JOB ONE ACROSS THE ECONOMY WE S. THE MAN FLEX AS A STRAY TO USE THE CLEAN CLEAR MOLECULES AND CLEAN CLEAN ELECTRONS PARTICULAR WHEN THEY ARE AVAILABLE IN THE BRIDGE YEAH AND- TRY TO AVOID USING THE HIGHER CARBON ELECTRONS. SO THAT TIME IT IS REALLY IMPORTANT AND INCREASING IMPORTANCE TO UNDERPIN OUR RELIABILITY OF OUR GREAT IN THE STATE AND IS A KEY STRATEGY PRETTY CARBONIZATION AS WELL. AND THE GOVERNOR'S IN THE GAS SYSTEM YOU'LL HEAR SOME ABOUT AS WELL WE CAN'T SUBSTITUTE SOME OF THOSE MOLECULES SO EQUITY WE JUST HAVE TO FOCUS ON EQUITY AND HAS TO BE A FOUNDATION I'LL TALK ABOUT IT'S JUST VERY VERY BRIEFLY ABOUT. WHAT THAT MEANS BUT OUR PROGRAMS REALLY NEED TO FOCUS ON THE FOLKS WHO CAN'T AFFORD THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE WILL- THAT WILL BE- SUGGESTING AND- WE- CAN'T CONVERT THE PROGRAM. APPROACH TO START WITH UNDER RESOURCE COMMUNITIES AND ENCOURAGE THE MARKET TO SCALE UP FROM THERE I THINK THAT'S A- THAT THAT'S REALLY CRITICAL TO GET THE TECHNOLOGIES AT SCALE QUICKLY. IN THE SECTORS THAT CAN LEAST AFFORD THEM AND USE THAT AS A MARKET TRANSFORMATION STRATEGY. A DIRECT COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT CANNOT EMPHASIZE THE NEED TO WORK THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THIS HAPPEN ACROSS THE STATE. AND THEN PROGRAM AND FINANCIAL MECHANISMS TO HELP MAKE ALL THIS HAPPEN. WE WILL NOT REACH OUR CLIMATE GOALS UNLESS WE LOOK AT IT THROUGH AN EQUITY LENS THAT'S A KEY TECHNOLOGIES HIGHLY EFFICIENT ELECTRIC APPLIANCES WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HE PUMPS FOR WATER AND SPACE HEATING INDUCTION STOVES. THAT'S NOT PART OF THE BUILDING CODE BUT IT'S ALSO A KEY. ENABLER IN SOME CASES WE'RE HERE WHERE WE'RE SEEING ACT TO- FULL EXPLICATION. AND ELECTRIC CLOTHES DRYER SIDEKICK OR HEAT PUMP CLOTHES DRIERS ARE NOT QUITE THERE YET BUT THEY'RE GETTING THERE. WILL BE A SOLUTION IN THE FUTURE- WE HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE PANELING THE PANELS AND WIRING. EXISTING BUILDINGS THAT UPGRADE COST IS NOT TRIVIAL- AND SOLAR IT WITH STORAGE NOW TO IMPROVE ITS FLEXIBILITY AND ITS DECARBONISATION ACT. IS ALSO AN ONGOING STRATEGY INCREASINGLY WITH STORAGE AVAILABLE IN THE MARKET. AND IT LOOKS LIKE STABILITY AS I SAID FINANCING MODELS WE DID THE NUMBERS ON HOW MUCH HOW MUCH MONEY ESSENTIALLY IT'S GOING TO COST TO UPGRADE THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK ACROSS THE STATE WERE TALKING. IN THE ORDER OF THIRTY TO FORTY BILLION DOLLARS. OVER THE COURSE OF. THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS OR SO THAT'S A SUSTAIN INVESTMENT THAT WE NEED WE'RE NOT SUGGESTING THAT. THE THE BILL JUST ASSESSMENT RIGHT IT'S NOT IT'S NOT A RECOMMENDATION BUT I THINK THE- IDEA THERE WOULD BE THAT WE HAVE TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE INVESTMENT AND REALLY DO THAT HANDSHAKE BUT PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS AND FIGURE OUT WAYS. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN IN PARTICULAR FOR LOW INCOME AND RENTERS. WORKING WITH THOSE SECTORS DIRECTLY TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THEM. ONE SOLUTION IS TERRACED ON BILL FINANCING WHICH IS A REALLY PRACTICAL SOLUTION THAT HELPS NEWS OFF BALANCE SHEET. CAPITAL BUT GETS THE RECOVERY ON THE UTILITY BILL. SO THAT'S A THAT'S A PROMISING SOLUTION HAVING SOME ARE TRACK NOW IN IN L. YEAH AND WE REALLY AS I SAID NEED TO FOCUS ON PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS. SO I'M GONNA SHOW COUPLE PICTURES- BASICALLY THE TO THE IF YOU LOOK AT THE BOTTOM LINE THAT'S THE ONSITE EMISSIONS REDUCTION. GOAL OF LEVELS. AND IT REALLY ONLY OR TO- SCENARIOS TO PASSWORD STRATEGIES TO GET US THERE THE AGGRESSIVE ELECTRIFICATION AND EFFICIENT AGGRESSIVE ELECTRIFICATION WASTE THE LITTLE OF THE LIGHTER COLOR AT THE TOP IS THE REFRIGERANTS THAT ALSO NEED A SOLUTION TO LOWER THEIR GLOBAL WARMING POTENTIAL- BUT THOSE TWO- AND ALL THE STRATEGIES THAT ARE LISTED ARE THE TWO THAT REALLY GET US WHERE. TO GO TERMS OF REDUCING BUILDING RELATED EMISSIONS BOTH ONSITE AND SYSTEM WIDE AND THEN THIS ONE IS THE SAME SCENARIOS- AND IT LOOKS AT THE COST PER TIME IS THE RED LINE. AND THE SQUARES AND THEN THE OVERALL COSTS AND YOU KNOW YOU CAN SEE THOSE TWO SCENARIOS. HAVE A COST PER TON OF CARBON REDUCTIONS OF ABOUT A HUNDRED FORTY DOLLARS IN THE MID THIRTIES HIGH THIRTIES IN TERMS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INVESTMENT NEEDED. TO MAKE THOSE HAPPEN HI ENERGY EFFICIENCY IS A NEGATIVE COST IT STILL WORKS REALLY WELL BUT THE SCALE OF IT PRETTY CARBONIZATION IS JUST NOT GONNA GET US THERE SO WE SHOULD DO THAT. BUT WE DO NEED TO FOCUS ON. FUEL SUBSTITUTION WITH CLEAN ELECTRICITY WHEREVER POSSIBLE SO EXISTING BUILDINGS THERE- LIST OF CHALLENGES HERE. THE TIMING CONSUMER FAMILIARITY. CAPITALS I MENTIONED. SOME SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES PERHAPS THOSE ARE THOSE WILL GET WORKED OUT- AND ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS RATES WANT TO SURE INSURE REALLY YOU SHOULD SEE SOME OF THE BENEFIT IS THERE FOR RIGHT THE CUSTOMER- SO- WITH THAT SEAT SO HERE THE CONCLUSIONS- SO WE NEED A LARGE SCALE DEPLOYMENT LIKE. THIS NEARLY CONSTRUCTION NEWLY CONSTRUCTED BUILDINGS IF YOU SUGGESTED YOUR HOLDEN HAVE THE LOWEST COST IN ARE REALLY SORT OF THE EASIER PART A PROBLEM. MAKING WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THAT FRONT- SO EFFICIENCY AND PROVEN ABILITY CLOSE ALIGNMENT WITH THE CONVERSATION AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SO. LARGE INVESTMENTS IN THE EXISTING BUILDINGS ARE NEEDED- AND FURTHER LONG TERM. RELIABILITY IMPACTS AS WELL NEED ASSESSING ARE BOTH ON THE GAS SIDE AND SIDE. THE BILL ASKS US TO DO. THAT WE BEGIN THAT WORK WITH THAT WILL CONTINUE NUMBER CERTAINLY CAN IS A KEY PART OF THIS A AS WELL AND THEN THE GAS SYSTEM ROLE ANY INCENTIVES NEED FURTHER REVIEWSUPPER GONNA REALLY SHIFT. FROM ONE FIELD TO ANOTHER WE HAVE TO CAREFULLY PLAN THAT OVER TIME SOME ABOUT SOMETHING ABOUT THAT. WOULD PROBABLY OTHERS SPEAKERS AS WELL AND PERHAPS THE DISCUSSION SO EQUITY IS CRITICAL- COLLABORATION A CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THIS IS A ALL HANDS ON DECK AS BOTH OF YOU AS FOR THE FUTURE HOLD. HI INJURY THAT CENTS ADJUSTED- BROKE THEIR WORKFORCE NEEDS LIKE THOSE WILL COME ALONG WITH MARKET EXPANSION- AND- I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO WORK ALONGSIDE RESPONSES TO BUILDING NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING HELP US-% BERMAN AS ARE VARIOUS STATE EFFORTS AND WE HAVE SOME PROGRAMS TO WITH NEW AFFORDABLE HOUSING THAT ARE HELPING TO PUT RESOURCES INTO ELECTRIFICATION SECTOR. SO I WILL WRAP UP THERE I REALLY APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE WITH YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO BE DOING THAT AND THAT WAS A LOT QUICKLY BUT THAT. YOU CAN REFER TO THOSE SLIDES AT YOUR AT YOUR LEISURE I APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR DOCTOR BEING HERE AND REALLY THE THOUGHTFULNESS BEHIND THE PRESENTATION- AND WE DO LOOK FORWARD TO THE QUEUE IN A- APART WE WILL COME BACK TO YOU AND POSE SOME QUESTIONS. NEXT WE HAVE JOSE TORRES OF THE BUILDING TO CARBONIZATION COALITION WHO WILL DISCUSS THEIR COALITION'S EFFORTS TO DECARBONISE CALIFORNIA'S BUILDINGS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WELCOME MR TAURUS. GOOD AFTERNOON SHAREHOLDER JERRY BUSS AND SOME MEMBERS- WAS IT TOWARDS WITH THE CALIBER CALPERS DIRECTORS WITH THE BIG BUILDING DECARBONIZATION COALITION- JUST A LITTLE BIT ABOUT US THE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION COALITION UNITES BUILDING INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS. WITH ENERGY PROVIDERS BY MENTAL ORGANIZATIONS- LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO POWER CALPERS HOMES AND WORK SPACES BETWEEN ENERGY. SO THE COMMON GOAL FOR OUR DIVERSE MEMBERSHIP. IS TO- FOCUS ON CREATING SAFE AFFORDABLE AND HEALTHY COMMUNITIES THROUGH ALL ACTION BUILDINGS- ASSETS CALIFORNIA DIRECTOR I SIX LETTERS BILLING DEPARTMENT VEHICLE FOR CREATING HEALTHY. AND RESILIENT HOMES FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS AND CENTERING EQUITY. TO PRIORITIZE A MULTI UNIT SO SORRY NOT SURE THE SLIDE SHOW COME ON THE OR EXECUTIVE OUR THANK YOU WORDS LIKE TO. THANKS SO MUCH SO YOU KNOW WHEN WE'RE THINKING OF BUILDING THE ORGANIZATION AND WHAT IT MEANS TO CREATE A SAFE HEALTHY AFFORDABLE AND RESILIENT ALL- YEAH I THINK MISSIONAL CAL SERVER KIND OF PLAIN EVERYTHING OUT IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW BUILDINGS MAKE UP A BIG CHUNK OF OUR GREENHOUSE GAS PORTFOLIO- BUT FR THE MORE- YOU KNOW THESE BUILDINGS ALSO NAY MORE KNOCKS OUT OR PUT. IN OUR CARS AND POWER PLANTS COMBINED WHICH HAVE SEVERE IMPACTS ON HUMAN HEALTH- SO UNFORTUNATE LIKE MANY OTHER THINGS RIGHT THIS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTS COMMUNITIES OF COLOR- AND IT'S IN PART DUE OF COURSE TO- RACISM IT'S ORG ONE JUSTICE BUT ALSO BECAUSE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE IN OLDER SMALLER THAT'S BEEN LAID MORE CROWDED HOMES. USE GAS COOKING EQUIPMENT FOR SPACE AND SO AS WE THINK ABOUT REMOVING THE BUT AND YOU KNOW COMBATING CRIME CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S A COMMUNITY CAN BE IN ONLINE THINK UP BUILDING ACTED LEAD TO THE KITCHEN OF THE KEEP SCHOOLS GOING AT DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. AND ALL CALIFORNIANS RIGHT HAVE HEALTHIER MORE FOR BOTH STATE- NEXT SLIDE PLEASE AND THEN IT IF WE TAKE A STEP BACK AND LOOK AT ALL THE CHALLENGED CALIFORNIANS ARE DEALING WITH RIGHT AND I DON'T HAVE TO SHOULD. TELL YOU THIS RIGHT BUT JUST FOR THE SAKE OF. HIGHLIGHTINGWHY- YOU KNOW BUILDING DECARBONIZATION IS A CRITICAL PIECE- L. THE FOLKS ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED THAT THAT DIRE SITUATION WHEN IT COMES TO WILDFIRES RIGHT BUT WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT HARD TO PRODUCE A LOT OF PROJECTS. TO MAKE THINGS BETTER BUT ONE THING WHERE WE THINK BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION- AND SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY HEAT PUMPS FOR SPACE HEATING. IS WE CAN ENSURE THAT FOLKS GET WEATHER RIGHTS. LEAD VISION POLLUTION FREE HOME RIGHT. IF YOU INSTALL HEAT PUMP WITH ILLUSTRATION. THEN THAT'S ONE WAY TO ENSURE THAT FOLKS PROTECTED FROM OUTDOOR POLLUTION. AND ARE PROTECTED INDOORS WITH THAT LEADALL- EXTREME HEAT- YOU KNOW I KNOW A LOT OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE- BUT A LOT OF MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. CHAIRED BY SOME EXTREME HEAT SO THAT IS THAT WE KNOW THE RECOGNITION OF THE HORRIBLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED IN THE CITY OF NORTHWEST- IN TERMS OF DEBTS AND THE NEED FOR A LOT OF COMMUNITIES TO. OP YOU KNOW. BE ABLE TO COMBAT AGAINST EXTREME HEAT AND AGAIN RIGHT IN THE PATH WICKS BUILDING LOCATION WE CAN KEEP UP SPACE HEATING. CAN NOT ONLY HELP US GET CLOSE TO OUR APARTMENT. GOALS BUT ALSO ENSURE THAT THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT MOST. IN TAKE ON YOU KNOW. REALLY BAD SMOG TAKE ON EXTREME HEAT. AND PROVIDE THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO BE ABLE T FIGHTAGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL TIME AND ALSO PREVENTS IT. GETTING WORSE I'M EXCITED I JUST THE POINT RUN EXTREME WHAT RIGHT PROPER FROM INDICATOR THAT I ON WHETHER HAVE RIGHT SO WHEN I THINK THE COOLING RIGHT COME FROM A DJ COMMITTEE SELF I THINK THE FARMWORKERS INSTRUCTOR WORKERS OR ANYONE FOR THAT MATTER RIGHT AND I THINK THAT WHEN THEY GET HOME RIGHT THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO HAVE RELEASED ABOUT THAT. BACKGROUND TO PROTECT THEM FROM THE SMOKE OUTSIDE AND SOMETHING AND FROM THE EXTREME HEAT AND STUFF THAT DOESN'T EXACERBATE EVERYTHING THAT IS MAKING OUR LIVING CONDITIONS MORE DIFFICULT. CLIMATE CHANGE- EXCITEMENT SO IN A ROAD MAP RIGHT AS WE DISCUSS HOW TO GET TO TWENTY THIRD TWENTY TWENTY FIVE BUT AS WE'VE SEEN RIGHT SB THIRTY TO DEMONSTRATE THAT EVEN FOR A NEW MOVIE. UP YOU KNOW OUR NEW STATE TWENTY THIRTY FIVE CARBON NEUTRALITY GOALS ELECTRIFICATION IS THE ONLY PATH TO GET THERE- AND WE UNDERSTAND THAT WILL BE ELECTRIFYING AT HOME IS THE BIG CHALLENGE RIGHT RECOGNIZE WORKING HARD TO DO THAT BUT WE ALSO WANT HIGH THINK THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALREADY HAVE TAKEN STEPS TOWARDS AN ELECTRIC FUTURE RIGHT THROUGH NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ABOUT FORTY MORE. ARE CONSIDERING THIS. IT ARE CONSIDERED AN EXISTING BUILDINGS. SO THIS PRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE STATE TO PICK UP THE MANTLE AND PROVIDE ACTED OUT OF THE FUNDING SO THOSE COMMUNITIES. WHO NEED IT MOST AND THE PROGRAMMING IN EXISTING BUILDINGS CAN ALSO REAP THE BENEFITS A BILL ELECTRIFICATION. SO YOU KNOW IT'S BEGIN TO ACHIEVE AS WE THINK WE NEED A BIG INVESTMENT- AND SO FAR. THE STATE HAS MADE SOME INVESTMENTS AND BE AND ALTHOUGH TO BE COMMUNITIES VERY THANKFUL. YOU THINK THERE'S MUCH MORE FUNDING NEEDED- YOU KNOW THAT WHEN. 90% OF TECHNOLOGIES COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE WE FEEL LIKE IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY RIGHT- TO THE STATE TO LEVERAGE THE OPPORTUNITIES BE PROCESS PROVIDE IMMEDIATE RELIEF TO LOCAL DISPENSED COMMUNITIES. BY INVESTING IN TECHNOLOGY SUCH AS SO IF YOU OPEN BUDGET FUNDING WE THINK THEY'RE GONNA NEED AND OCT TWENTY NOT THAT HE PLANS TO THE SOLUTION- IT'S ALSO ONE AGAIN ELEVATE. THE MEMORY MUST KEEP IN AND SET HOUSE UP EFFORTS AROUND HUBS IN OTHER OTHER STRATEGIES AS PART OF THE EXTREME HEAT. SOLUTION BUT WANT TO ADD YOU KNOW. HE COMES IN BILLION DECARBONISATION. TO THE MIX AT NC CLARIFY RIGHT- AS WE THINK OF THE ROAD MAP AND GETTING TO TWENTY FORTY FIVE WE UNDERSTAND THESE DIFFERENT APPROACHES RIGHT THAT ARE ALL ABOUT ELECTRIFICATION WHETHER IT'S- TRILLION APPROACHING A WHOLE COMMUNITY THROUGH INVESTMENTS. AND INVESTING IN HEAT PUMPS RIGHT BUT WE THINK THE MOST IMMEDIATE THING WE CAN DO WHILE PROVIDING MULTIPLE BENEFITS AT THIS POINT IS. INVESTING IN PEOPLE SPACEY AND LASTLY BUT NOT. YOU KNOW. NOT GOOD BUT VERY IMPORTANTLY CALIFORNIA MUST COMMIT RIGHT TO EACH IN ORACLE COMMUNITIES AND WORKERS THAT. IT WILL LISTEN AND CENTER EQUITY BEAMS OF ITS WORK. AND CHECKING SOLUTIONS THAT DO NOT COST MORE BUT INSTEAD PROVIDE BENEFIT. AND WE THINK THROUGH CONSISTENT INVESTMENT WE CAN PROVIDE MARKET CERTAINTY. TO OUR MANUFACTURING BUT ALSO CREATE A PLAN. THAT INSURERS YOU KNOW WORKERS. EAT COMMUNITIES AND EVERYONE HAS A CLEAR IDEA OF HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE- AND- ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. FOR YOUR TIME ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE NOW UP WE HAVE SERENITY COMO OF THE HOUSING WHOSE ON EFFORTS TO THE CAR X. MULTI FAMILY AND AFFORDABLE RENTAL UNITS WELCOME IS KUMAR IN HERE A GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS SHANNON DECEMBER QUEMADA AND THE SUSTAINABLE HOUSING POLICY AND PROGRAM MANAGER AT THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP I'M GRATEFUL TO THE ASSEMBLY UTILITY AND ENERGY COMMITTEE FOR GIVING ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK CALIFORNIA HOUSING PARTNERSHIP USE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION AS A KEY FOB FORWARD TO MEET THE STATE'S AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESERVE THE EXISTING MULTI FAMILY AFFORDABLE HOUSING STOCK. LOW INCOME RENTERS WERE PREDOMINANTLY BLACK AND BROWN BATTLEGROUND OF CHINA CHANGE IMPACTS THE FEWEST RESOURCES TO COPE WITH ITS IMPACTS. NONPROFIT HOUSING PROVIDERS WILL LARGELY SO THESE COMMUNITIES ARE PRETTY MAKING AN EFFORT. TO ELECTRIFY THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. VIDAK AND I SEVERAL CONVENING IS HELD INTERVIEWS WITH NONPROFIT AFFORDABLE HOUSING DATABASE AND ONE OF THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE THEIR SAME. PRODUCT OF CATION IT'S JUST A LACK OF STABLE CONSISTENT AND FLEXIBLE FUNDING. THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING TO ELECTRIFY EXISTING BUILDING STOCK AND MORE IMPORTANTLY TO MAKE AN ELECTRIFICATION READY. BY THE LAUGHTER THAT I NEED THERE'S NOT ENOUGH FUNDING FOR. PANEL UPGRADES AND JOHNSON KNOCKED BATES WHO GENERALLY CRESCENTA MAKES THAT ARE INSTALLED SOME OF THESE. EARLY OF EXPENSIVE EQUIPMENT SUCH CLOSE. AND A LOT OF PROGRAMS DON'T COVER THEM BECAUSE THEY ARE PROGRAM METRICS UP TIED TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS AND THESE ARE JUST AND DRUG AND INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES THAT UNDER THE TIE BACK. TO GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS YEAH INSPECTOR THAT BECOME THAT WHEN WE IS ON HOW FIND HOUSING IS PROBABLY SEVEN OF YOU KNOW AS EXTREME CALM AND EXPENSIVE PROVIDERS TO MAKE THAT OF OCCUPATIONS THEY NEED TO SHOW MASSIVE COST PER UNIT AND A TO BRING EXISTING BUILDINGS OUT TO SOME OF THOSE THAT WILL. ALSO BE FINDING THAT HOUSING PROGRAMS SOMETIMES ACTUALLY PENALIZE PROVIDERS OR. PROVIDING ELECTRICITY INTO HOMES LIVING ON SOME OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALSO IN THE WORLD AND THERE'S A NEED FOR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SUPPORT NOT JUST AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS BUT ALSO THE INDUSTRY THAT SEPTEMBER CHANGED ITS CONTRACTORS. ARCHITECTS AND ENGINEERS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING RESIDENTS BOTH RECEIVE THE HEALTH AND SAFETY BENEFITS BUT ALSO NOT BETTING ON DEEP AND BACKS. THE DATA AND DATA PLUS THE LEGISLATURE TO LOOK INTO THE FOLLOWING RECOMMENDATION. ONE IS JUST PROVIDING LOS TAPER AND CONSISTENT FUNDING FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDE ECSTATIC TO FIND AN EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. AND TO FUND. UPGRADES LIKE KIND OF GRAYSON TRANSFORM UPGRADES WHICH GO BEYOND GHG EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS METRICS ONE SUCH PROGRAMS THAT ARE INCOMPATIBLE DAY STATION PROGRAM WHICH CURRENTLY HAS A WEAKNESS TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND HOUSEHOLDS ONE ALL LOWER INCOME ALL LIVING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SECOND IS ENSURING THAT HOUSING PROGRAMS CONSIDER THE LONG TERM HEALTH AND ECONOMIC. IMPACTS OF CAPITAL GAS APPLIANCES INTERESTED IN SCHOOL ESPECIALLY THOSE WITH LOW INCOME RESIDENTS HOMES AND REALLY ALLOWING AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS TO MAKE ELECTRIFICATION OF UPGRADES BY TREATING IT AS A PUBLIC BENEFIT SO IT IS JUST ENSURING THAT WE HAVE ELECTRIFICATION FRIENDLY THREE. AND THE LAST IS PROVIDING ROBUST TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE IN CONCLUSION I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT HEALTHY RECIPE AND ARMS CANNOT BE A LUXURY ATTACKS IT'S NOT FOR THE CONTACT WE HAVE KNOCKED WITH. THE ECONOMIC BURDENS AND ENERGY BURDENS AND THE USUALLY DANCE BURDENS FACED BY LOWER INCOME CALIFORNIANS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING IS PRIORITISED AS A MEANS TO EQUITABLY ELECTRIFYING OF BUILDINGS AND BELIEVE THAT AN EQUITABLE ALLOCATION POLICY. COULD I ADDRESS SOME OF THIS ARTICLE AND MY MENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICES RATHER THAN JUST AS THIS OP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU ON THIS ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY AND HOUSING AND HOW MULTI FAMILY HOMES- CAN BE TRANSITION BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS ONE OF OUR- MAJOR CHALLENGES GOING FORWARD THE NEXT WE HAVE JOSH GREEN OF A. O. SMITH CORPORATION WHO WILL DISCUSS TECHNOLOGICAL CHALLENGES OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL DECARBONISATION WELCOME MR GREEN. AFTERNOON- CHAIR HOLDING CAN YOU HEAR ME YES WE CAN OKAY VERY GOOD- THANK YOU AND- I'M GONNA JUMP INTO A COUPLE OF SLIDES IN MY TESTIMONY BUT- JUST AS A CURSORY MARC LIKE TO THANK. YOU CHAIR HOLDEN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- TERRY OF US- FOR AFFORDING A- SMITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY AND ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY IN OUR FIFTEEN THOUSAND EMPLOYEES AROUND THE WORLD AGAIN WOULD LIKE TO THANK YOU- OR- OUR PARTICIPATION HERE- AS A FOUNDATIONAL MATTER- AO SMITH- WHICH IS BEEN INNOVATING- SINCE ITS FOUNDING. IN EIGHTEEN SEVENTY FOUR IN MILWAUKEE WISCONSIN I'M HERE WE'RE THE LARGEST MANUFACTURER OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL WATER HEATING HYDRONIC HEATING BOILERS- AND POOL HEATERS- WE RECOGNIZE THAT AND APPRECIATE THAT REDUCING THE CARBON INTENSITY OF BUILDINGS- AND IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT AS PART OF BROADER POLICY INITIATIVES TO DECARBONIZE OUR ECONOMY. TO MITIGATE THE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ALONG THOSE LINES WE'VE BUILT AN ANALYTICAL TOOL THAT CAN ASSIST POLICY MAKERS AS WELL AS OUR CUSTOMERS. AND UNDERSTANDING WATER HEATING SOLUTION SCENARIOS- BASED ON STATE LOCAL ENERGY DATA AS WELL AS SITE CONDITIONS- WHEN CONTEMPLATING OR NAVIGATING BUILDING DECARBONIZATION POLICIES- AND OTHER RELATED TO CIVICALLY TO EXISTING BUILDINGS. ANY TRANSITION AWAY FROM UTILIZING NATURAL GAS FOR SPACE AND WATER HEATING TO ELECTRICITY EXCLUSIVELY I THINK AS WE'VE HEARD A PRESENTS SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES- FOR BOTH THE PHYSICAL INFRASTRUCTURE- THE ELECTRICITY GRID MODERNIZATION ISSUES THAT COME ALONG WITH THAT AND QUITE BY CANDIDLY A CONSUMER AWARENESS AND ACCEPTANCE. I'M SO AS IT RELATES SPECIFICALLY- TO IF YOU CAN- CC BY MY CAN YOU SEE MY SLOW SHARE THE WELL- THEY'RE KIND OF MOVING ON THE SIDE THERE THERE ON THE SCREEN BUT THEY'RE NOT OKAY. ALL RIGHT THERE'S I WANT TO MOVE TO JUST THE THREE SLIDES AROUND UP BUT THIS AND OPRY'S AND TATIAN MODE- SO WE CAN HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING SKEWS ME SO AS OUR AS OUR HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS AND THAT'S YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY ONE OF THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGIES- THAT WILL HELP ADDRESS BUILDING DECARBONIZATION. L. A. O. SMITH HAS TECHNOLOGIES TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE BUILDING STOCK CHALLENGES MULTI FAMILY YOU CAN SEE HERE COMMERCIAL LIKE COMMERCIAL KITCHENS RESTAURANTS AND OF COURSE A RESIDENTIAL- SO ONE OF THE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF OPPORTUNITIES BECAUSE THERE IS A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY- WE TALK ABOUT NEW CONSTRUCTION AND ENSURE HOLDEN YOU ADDRESS THIS IS AS WELL AS OTHERS. I'D ALWAYS THE EASIEST TIME TO INSTALL- KEEP UP WATER HEATERS AND MORE INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES- ENTITLED TWENTY FOUR AND CALIFORNIANS- CODE- IS GOING TO HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL INCENTIVES FOR BUILDERS- TO INSTALL HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS THAT'S GREAT- REBATE PROGRAMS ARE FRIENDS AND UTILITY COMMUNITY- ARE VERY ADROIT AT AT IMPLEMENTING ARE ALSO A KEY PIECE- GETTING CONSUMER AWARENESS UP- IS THIS AN OPPORTUNITY CONTRACTOR TRAINING. AND WE ALLUDED TO THIS- AND I THINK ONE OF MY FELLOW PANELISTS TALKED ABOUT THIS IN THE MULTI FAMILY CONTEXT I'M THE RETROFITTING REPLACEMENT CENTER PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY IN PLACE IN CALIFORNIA- THE ACRONYMS OF TACK AND BUILD IN AN ESCAPE- OVER A QUARTER OF A BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING- CERTAINLY OVER THE NEXT. TWO. CONTINUE ON THE TRACK- AS RELATES TO- THE EXISTING STOCK THESE ARE JUST SOME OTHER OPPORTUNITIES THE SLIDES AND I KNOW OUR SLIDES ARE WERE MADE PART OF THE RECORD TO WORK WELL ON THIS- A TO MUCH BUT THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT IN REAL TIME- LAYERED ON TOP OF TITLE TWENTY FOUR HOURS. CODE REQUIREMENTS FOR BOTH SINGLE FAMILY AND MULTI FAMILY WARY OF SMITH ON A SEIZE UP BOTH NEW CONSTRUCTION AS WELL AS RETROFIT REPLACEMENT ACTIVITY- CERTAINLY OVER THE NEXT- TWO YEARS FINALLY CHALLENGES AND I KNOW THAT'S A KEY PART OF OUR- OF THE HEARING TODAY- SO WE TALK ABOUT A LOT OF THE BUILDING STOCK IS OLDER- THERE ARE SPACE CONSTRAINTS AS RESPECTS RELATES TO HEAT PUMP WATER HEATING EQUIPMENT. UP WE HAVE INCENTIVES BETWEEN THE BUILDING. BUILDING OWNERS- CERTAINLY RENTERS- AND WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR OUR SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ESPECIALLY IN THE RESTAURANT. AND LODGING AND HOSPITALITY COMMUNITY. AN END HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS WHILE ARE VERY INNOVATIVE AND CERTAINLY THE MOST EFFICIENT WAY TO KEEP WATER. THEY'RE STILL IN TECHNOLOGY. AND JUST TO GIVE THE COMMITTEE A SCALE. EIGHT MILLION WATER HEATERS THAT ARE SOLD ANNUALLY IN THE UNITED STATES. RIGHT NOW A HUNDRED THOUSAND OF THOSE ARE HEAT PUMP WATER HEATERS. IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT TEN MILLION WATER HEATERS IN THE INSTALL BASE 90% OF THOSE ARE GAS FIRED. SO WE'RE LOOKING AT NINE BILLION WATER HEATERS TO CONVERT IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EIGHT MILLION WATER HEATERS BEING MANUFACTURED ANNUALLY YOU CAN SEE THERE'S A DELTA THERE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED. BUT ALSO AS COMMISSIONER MCALLISTER A REFERENCE ACOSTA. RIGHT THAT'S SOMEWHAT SIGNIFICANT- AND CERTAINLY WE WOULD REFER TO POLICY MAKERS ON THE ECONOMICS OF THE POLITICAL FEASIBILITY OF LONG LASTING FUNDING IN THAT REGARD. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY GOING TO BE NEEDED I CERTAINLY HAS A MANUFACTURER- AND SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF OUR INDUSTRY YEAH WE'RE LOOKING AT OTHER SUPPLY CHAIN MATERIAL ISSUES- GRANTED WE'RE IN THIS KIND OF. CODED YOU KNOW POST CODE EIGHT. A SITUATION- BUT THOSE ARE ALSO CHALLENGES THAT THAT WE'RE WORKING TOWARDS. SO IN CONCLUSION WANTED TO BE EFFICIENT WITH OUR TESTIMONY- CERTAINLY REDUCING CARBON INTENSITY BUILDINGS PART OF A BROADER DE CAR POLICIES. THE QUICK TRANSITION AWAY IS GOING TO HAVE SOME CHALLENGES BUT AGAIN THEY. CAN BE OVERCOME WE DO HAVE TO LOOK AT THE X. X. A RETROFIT MILLION OF HOUSE AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS- BUT A. O. SMITH STANDS READY TO BE A RESOURCE AND A PARTNER AND I JUST WANT TO STRESS THAT- WE'VE HAD WONDERFUL WORKING RELATIONSHIPS CERTAINLY IN THE ASSEMBLY- MANY THE VARIOUS COMMISSIONS WITH COMMISSIONER MCALLISTER AND HIS STAFF. AND WE'RE HERE TO BE A RESOURCE- AND ONCE AGAIN WANT TO THANK YOU- CHAIR HOLDEN. AND THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING US HERE TODAY THANK YOU MISTER GREEN APPRECIATION PRESENTATION. NEXT WE HAVE YURI FRIEDMAN OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS WHO WILL DISCUSS POTENTIAL DECARBONIZATION STRATEGIES APART FROM ELECTRIFICATION. WELCOME MR FRIEDMAN. SHAREHOLDERS WITH THAT CHERRY EVANS COMMISSIONER MCALLISTER THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. I'M GOING INTO A PROJECT MY SLIDES OR AT THE VERY LEAST HELPFUL MY ABSOLUTE BEST TO TRY THAT AND. BUT I CAN'T HELP YOU CAN HELP ME BECAUSE I HAVE A LITTLE STRUGGLING TRYING TO PULL SLIDES UP I WAS WONDERING WHETHER WE SHOP WITH THE SLIDES. WHILE WORKING ON THAT WILL TRY TO ASSIST YOU THIS RESTORING EVERYONE SECOND I'M HOPING THAT WE ARE SIX BEST PHONE FORTUNE WHEN I CUT COULD NOT SEIZE THE MOMENT APOLOGIZE FOR THE DELAY. WE HAVE AN IMAGE ON OUR SCREEN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHERE YOU WANT KNOW WHAT I'D LIKE IT IS VOTE FOR ONE OF THAT- SUPPORTING MEMBERS AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER THE PROJECT MY SLIDE BUT UNFORTUNATELY YEAR ONE SECOND WITHOUT HAVING DIFFICULT YEAH AND WHEN THE SOFTWARE. WELL. CAN CAN YOU PLEASE HELP ME WITH THAT THE PROJECT MY PRESENTATION. I THINK THEY'RE WORKING ON IT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE A PATIENT THAT'S IT LET LET'S GO THE FIRST LANGUAGE. BUT NEXT WEAPONS. THANK YOU IT IS THERE AND AGAIN I APOLOGIZE FOR THE WAY THESE THAT THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT SLIDE THAT FRAME THE CONVERSATION ABOUT DECARBONIZATION IN THE TERMS THAT WE NEED TO DISCUSS SIMILAR TO A COMPLEX. OUR OBJECTIVE AND I'D LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION WITH THEIR RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THIS CHART THE SERVICE CHARGES THE SUMMER ANALYSIS THAT ASKS THE QUESTION. WHAT T WILL TAKE FOR US. ON A GLOBAL SCALE. TO REACH THE GOAL OF LIMITING GLOBAL WARMING HAVE DEGREES AND THE CONCLUSION THAT THEN ELSE'S CONDUCTED BY BLOOMBERG NEW ENERGY FINANCE. REACHED WAS THAT AS YOU CAN SEE ON THE RIGHT HAND SIDE THE CONTRIBUTION OF BALLOT TRUMP'S OF MOLECULES. TO THE ENERGY MAKES IS ABOUT EQUAL BETTER BELIEVE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO KEEP THEM ALL BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS SPENT A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT BEEN ACCOMPLISHED A LOT. IN ADVANCE OF A GENDER OFTEN ALCOHOLS I BELIEVE THE FOR US TO BE SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT SOLUTIONS THAT NOT ONLY LAW CALIFORNIANS REGION'S GOALS BUT THE ULTIMATE ULTIMATELY SERVE AS THE EXAMPLE OF THE MODEL AS A TEMPLATE FOR THE WORLD. WE NEED TO ADVANCE OUR ADOPTION OF THE MOLECULES AS VIGOROUSLY AS WE HAVE ADVANCED. PROBLEMS OF THESE SMALLER THIS IS FAIRLY BROAD SET OF THIS YEAR EMISSION AND THANK WILL NATURAL GAS FIVE. AND HYDROGEN THE BED BLACKBOOK THE BOTTLE OF WATER BOND IN SPECIFICALLY HYDROGEN. EXACTLY IS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING THAT I THINK- YEAH WE CAN TAKE AWAY ASHRAMS BETH ALSO GREEN HYDROGEN UP OYSTER RAP OF THE CHART IN FRONT OF YOU IS NOT A FORECAST IT'S VERY ALLOCATE WHAT HAPPENS WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE RENEWABLE POWER PRICES IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST DECADE. IT'S REMARKABLE THAT THEY DECLINE A FULL ORDER OF MAGNITUDE IN THE SPACE OF ABOUT DECADES. AND THAT IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST COMPONENT OF PASTA GREAT PACKAGE WAS AGREED HYDROGEN IS. IS TAKEN WATER AND USING POWER INCREASINGLY RENEWABLE POWER TO PRODUCE HYDROGEN SO AS RENEWABLE POWER PRICES DECLINE. SO DOES THE COST OF REPACKAGING MAKE IT AFFORDABLE FUEL. THANKS BYE WHICH IMPORTANT ELEMENT IN THIS LIGHT IS THAT- GREEN HYDROGEN CAN BE USED FOR YOU CAPITALIZE MULTIPLE SECTORS. AND AGAIN I WOULD DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION TO THE RIGHT HAND SIDE OF THE SLIDE YOU SEE ALL THE SECTORS BUT PRIVATE TREATMENT BE APPLICABLE IT IS THE PARALYZING TRANSPORTATION. ESPECIALLY HEAVY DUTY TRANSPORTATION WHERE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE THAT SOLUTION OF CHOICE. IT CAN ALSO BE USED AND THEY ARE WHY OUR WEEKS FOR THE PURPOSE OF THIS CONVERSATION IT CAN BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE BUILDINGS AND I'LL SHARE WITH YOU LATER ON SOME OF THE WORK ON. THEIR WEIGHT. AND IN OUR STATE NEXT I PLEASE. AS I TRIED TO SUMMARIZE IN THIS LIVE AT LEAST FOLLOW THE FACTS ABOUT WHAT'S BEING DONE WORLDWIDE EXPLORE USING HYDROGEN FOR FUEL THE DECARBONISATION IN THE U. K. THERE IS A OR ON THEIR WAY TO. EXAMINE CONVERSION OF CALLS HE TOOK LEAVES WHICH MEANS BY FROM METRICS THE THOUSANDS LARGEST CITY IN THE U. K. THE 100% PACKAGE ANOTHER HAVE PROFOUND WAY IS WHAT THEY CALL HIGH FOR. WHICH IS ALSO EXAMINING EVERY PLACEMENTOF MATH AND WITH HYDROGEN THERE IS A VAST OPEN MARSHALL BUILDINGS OUR NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH HAPPENED CAMPUS ARE ACTUALLY WORKING ON BLANDING AND ANOTHER FIFTY FIELD CONDITIONS WHEN THE HYDROGEN NATURAL GAS GREAT. ENABLE DIFFERENT REALIZATION OF AND USE THAT'S HAPPENING IN ONTARIO AND QUEBEC AND BRITISH PHAM ARE CLOSE BEHIND STUDY THAT'S- ANOTHER IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF WHAT FIVE G. AND THE BUILDINGS. IS THEIR FUEL CELLS WHICH RAMAN HIDING. BUT THEY DESCRIBED HIM AS MAY THE FACT IRWIN SIDE WHO WILL SELL THESE AND NATURAL GAS BUT RIGHT NOW MAJOR MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS FUNDS FUNNY. ARE ALL IN ALL OF THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE GOING THROUGH. ON YOUR HYDROGEN FUEL CELLS IN OUR STATE FLAG THE OUR OWN BILL FOR ENERGY RECENT DR THE PHONE BILLS ON HIGHBRIDGE WE ACTUALLY HAVE AN X. OF USING HYDROGEN BUILDINGS. IT'S BEEN BLENDED INTO THAT NATURAL GAS NETWORK AT ON THE CAMPUS OF UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA IRVINE AND WE AT CIRCLE GAS OUR BUILDING RIGHT NOW DEMONSTRATION PROJECT WHICH IS GOING TO DEMONSTRATE THE POTENTIAL HYDROGEN LAST BUILDINGS OR H. TWO HYDROGEN ALL LET'S GO TO NEXT SLIDE PLEASE SO THEY CAN TAKE AWAY AS I'D LIKE TO LEAVE YOU WITH IS THAT WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMBINATION APPROACH NEEDS TO BE HOLISTIC AND WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT BASICALLY WAS A TREMENDOUS FOR ALL FOUR THREE SCHEME TO PROVIDE YOU BUILDINGS WE BELIEVE THERE'S A ROLE FOR US TRONG AND FROM ALL ANGLES IN. APPRECIATION FOR EXISTING BUILDING STOCK WE BELIEVE THIS POLICYMAKERS SUPPOSED TO CAN EVEN PLAY ADVANCED JAVA AND ONE GOAL TO USE THAT WOULD BE ARE YOU WILL GUESS THAT. WOULD INCORPORATE MULTIPLE CLEAN GUEST BATH WAYS AND THE LAST BUT NOT THE LEAST WE BELIEVE AND FEEL STRONGLY THAT CALIFORNIA NEEDS STATEWIDE I DIDN'T STRATEGIES. WHICH IS GOING TO BE INTEGRATED ACROSS THE VARIOUS SOURCES OF FIBER JIM VERY ISSUES. AND ONE EXAMPLE OF THAT APPROACH THAT'S NOT BEING ACTIVELY DISCUSSED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS WELL AS HERE IN CALIFORNIA. IS A CONVERSATION ABOUT INDUSTRIAL HUBS WHICH ARE AT THE POTENTIAL. FOR A LOT OF HYDROGEN SCALE HIM TO MEETING CALIFORNIA THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR ATTENTION THANK YOU MISS FRIEDMAN WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AND CLEARLY HYDROGEN IS PART OF A CONVERSATION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO MAYBE HAVING SOME QUESTIONS THAT'LL BRING US BACK. INTO THAT TOPIC WITH YOU AND OTHERS FINALLY WE HAVE DOCTOR MICHAEL WERE A OF THE WOODS INSTITUTE AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY WHO WILL DISCUSS THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES AS THE STATE FACES THIS DECARBONIZATION TRANSITION WELCOME. DOCTOR WERE THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU'RE HOLDEN AND SHERRY THAT'S FOR INVITING ME TO TESTIFY- BEFORE THIS HEARING TODAY. WE RECENTLY COMPLETED ANALYSIS- FOCUSED ON THE COSTS OF DIFFERENT PATHWAYS. TO DECARBONISATION OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND MORE GENERALLY THE GASTRO FUSION SYSTEM IN CALIFORNIA AND I'M GONNA SHARE SOME INCLUSIONS FROM NETWORK AND MAYBE EXTEND A LITTLE BIT- UPON THEM TODAY- OUR ANALYSIS TARGETED- YOU KNOW QUESTIONS AROUND WHAT RATED PACKS DIFFERENT PATHWAYS TO. NATURAL GAS SYSTEM DECARBONISATION- MIGHT HAPPEN SO WE EVALUATED FOUR SCENARIOS- THE FIRST LOOK AT TITLE TWENTY FOUR AND FOCUSED ON NEW BUILDINGS I WON'T DISCUSS THAT TODAY BUT THE REMAINING THREE FOCUSED ON THE EXISTING BUILDING FULLY ARMED PARTICULAR- WE TRY TO EVALUATE THE RATE IMPACTS TO REMAINING NATURAL GAS CUSTOMERS SO THAT THE FOLKS THAT ARE KIND OF LEFT BEHIND IN A GAS TRANSITION PERHAPS. OF THREE APPROACHES THE FIRST WAS A BAN ON THE SALE OF EXISTING POWER GAS APPLIANCES THE SECOND WAS- INCREASED USE OF. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS HYDROGEN AND- SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS IN THE EXISTING PIPELINE SYSTEM RECOGNIZING CONSTRAINTS ON THE SUPPLIES OF ALL THREE OF THOSE- RESOURCES AND THE THIRD WAS- STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING OF THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEMATIC GOING INTO PARTICULAR NEIGHBORHOODS AND USING SUBSIDIES AND VARIOUS OTHER APPROACHES ELECTRIFYING IN NEIGHBORHOOD IN ORDER TO THEN DECOMMISSIONING GAS SYSTEM THE LAST MILE OF GAS SERVICE WITHIN THAT NEIGHBORHOOD ONCE IT HAD COMPLETELY ELECTRIFIED AND I'LL JUST SUMMARIZE OUR CONCLUSIONS QUICKLY AND THEN AND THEN GO INTO THAT MORE DEEPLY IT THAT THERE ARE NOW THIS IS- SUGGESTS A COUPLE OF THINGS THE FIRST IS THAT BECAUSE OF SAFETY INVESTMENTS THAT ARE. ALREADY GOING TO OCCUR GAS RATES ARE GONNA INCREASE QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE NEXT DECADE. AND THAT'S BAKED IN- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S ALREADY GONNA HAPPEN. AND IT NEEDS TO BE PART OF THE BASE PLAN UNDERSTOOD TO BE. PART OF THE BASE LINE SO. THEY'RE GOING TO BE IMPACTS BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE SAFETY- IMPROVEMENTS AFTER. BOTH SAN BRUNO AND LISA CANYON. THAT ARE GONNA RAISE COSTS AND ALREADY ARE RAISING COSTS FOR RATEPAYERS. INDEPENDENT OF ANY KIND OF- COSTS VARIATION ACROSS THE NATURAL GAS. THE SECOND MAIN CONCLUSION AND WE ARRIVED AT USING- WHEN I SHOULD SAY WE UTILIZED A MODIFIED VERSION OF THE E. THREE- NATURAL GAS RATE MODEL THAT WAS DEVELOPED FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION AS PART OF ITS WORK ON BUILDING DECARBONIZATION EATERY WAS KIND OF NOT SURE MODEL WITH US. AND WE OP AND MODIFIED BOTTLE FURTHER TO UNDERTAKE THE NONSENSE. BUT THE OTHER MAIN CONCLUSION THAT WE COME TO YOU. IS THAT WHAT ALL THREE POLICIES- BUT I JUST I MENTIONED. HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE. BUILDING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. THEY HAVE WIDELY VARYING COSTS IN PARTICULAR- AND APPLIANCE FAN OR IN APPROACH INVOLVED BIOMETHANE JOHN GREEN HYDROGEN AND SYNTHETIC NATURAL GAS APPEAR TO RAISE RATES QUITE SUBSTANTIALLY ALSO WHILE PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT EMISSION REDUCTIONS BY CONTRAST STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING OF THE GAS SYSTEM COULD HAVE MINIMAL EFFECTS ON RATES AND AT THE SAME TIME PRODUCE LARGE EMISSION REDUCTIONS SO THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN OBVIOUS CHOICE BUT I THINK THERE ARE IT'S IMPORTANT RECOGNIZED A COUPLE OF- CABBIE OUTS ONE IS THAT. WE DON'T CONSIDER THE OTHER SIDE EQUATION RIGHT THE COSTS OF THE INCENTIVES THAT ARE GONNA BE NECESSARY TO WHO TO DRIVE- STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING WE ALSO- AND WE POINT TO THIS IN THE REPORT AND I WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND THE WORD THE RECENT MARKETABILITY CARBONIZATION COALITION ON THIS ISSUE WE ALSO DON'T CAREFULLY EXAMINE IN THIS WORK THE COMPLEXITY OF SUCH AN UNDERTAKING AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT COMPLICATIONS WITH HER SHE'S STRATEGIC TO COMMISSION RIDICULOUS OR- THERE NEEDS TO BE THERE ARE PROBABLY NEED TO BE- LEGAL CLARIFICATION. ON THAT YOU TO GAS UTILITIES OBLIGATION TO SERVE- ANY ABILITY- UTILITY TO SUBSTITUTE GAS OR ELECTRIC SERVICE FOR GAS SERVICE NOT THAT GETS INTO YOU KNOW QUESTIONS OF ENERGY LAW AND SECTION FORTY ONE IN THE UTILITY COAT. BUT I THINK. IT'S LIKELY THAT IN ORDER TO CREATE CERTAINTY FOR THE UTILITIES THAT WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THESE LARGE INVESTMENTS- WE NEED TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF. CLARIFICATION FOR THEM THERE ON THE LEGAL SIDE- THE OTHER THE OTHER COMPLICATION THAT WE IDENTIFY AND IT'S IMPORTANT TO ADDRESS IS REALLY ABOUT CHOICE AND HALFPENNY THESE ARE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE WAIT ENERGY SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. AND WE POINT S. AS DO OTHERS TO THE SUCCESS OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY PILOTS. AND IMPORTANT EXAMPLES FOR EMPOWERING COMMUNITIES TO MAKE CHOICES ABOUT THEIR OWN ENERGY FUTURES AND- WE ARGUE THAT- THERE ISN'T THERE IN EVEN AS WE SEEK EFFECTIVE PATHWAYS TO MOVE FORWARD IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT THE STATE THE PC ENERGY COMMISSION- PARTNER WITH COMMUNITIES TO MAKE SURE THAT- THESE CHOICES ARE TAKEN- IN PARTNERSHIP WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE PUBLIC DISCUSSION AND DEBATE AND- WITH SURE INCE'S BACKS FUNDING WILL BE FORTHCOMING TO ALLOW FOR EQUITABLE CONVERSION IF THAT'S THE CHOICE IT'S MADE THE LAST THING I'D SAY CONCLUSION IS THAT ONE IMPORTANT- ASPECT OF OUR EXAMINATION OF RATE IMPACTS IS THAT THEY CAN BE ADDED TO AND SO THERE ARE REAL CONCERNS ABOUT FOR TAKING IN ALL OF THE ABOVE STRATEGY WHEN IT COMES TO BUILDING DECARBONIZATION BECAUSE IF WE IF WE FOR EXAMPLE. ARE PURSUE A TOTAL TWENTY FOUR STRATEGY AND PURSUE- BROWN METHANE STRATEGY AND PURSUE AN APPLIANCE BRAND STRATEGY IT COSTS MAY BE ADDED AND WE MAY FIND THAT- RATE PAYERS WHO ARE UNABLE TO ELECTRIFY OR ENOUGH PERHAPS BECAUSE THEY ARE TENANTS AND LANDLORDS CHOOSE NOT TO. MY FACE ESCALATING RATE IMPACTS DUE TO THE SORT OF COMBINATION STRATEGY WHICH SO OUR CONCLUSION RECOMMENDATION IS THAT BRANCH GROANING OR STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING IS REALLY THE BEST STRATEGY AT THIS THIS POINT IN TIME TO EXAMINE. AND THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR OPPORTUNITIES WITHIN THE GAS SYSTEM TO AVOID INVESTMENTS THAT ARE UPCOMING. BYE BYE- SELECTING AREAS WHERE WORST WE'RE DECOMMISSIONING COULD OCCUR AND ASSISTING HOMEOWNERS AND COMMERCIAL ENTITIES TO MAKE THE TRANSITION AS AS NECESSARY. WE CAN ALSO BY DOING THAT. TYLER APPROACH REALLY LEARN ABOUT WHAT THE BEST APPROACH IS ARE. I JUST INCLUDES- BY SAYING THAT WE'VE DONE THIS BEFORE IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE NUMEROUS EXAMPLES FROM HISTORY MOST NOTABLY THE TRANSITION FOR MANUFACTURE GAS AND NATURAL GAS WORK MAJOR INTERVENTIONS BY UTILITIES WERE MADE- TO SORT OF SWITCH THE WAY THAT ENERGY SERVICES WERE BEING PROVIDED TO. OUR RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THERE ARE PRECEDENTS. THERE ARE CHALLENGING THEY REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EFFORT IN COORDINATION BETWEEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UTILITIES THAT SERVE CUSTOMERS AND THE STATE AND WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT CAN OCCUR. AND THEN WE CAN SEE A FUTURE WHERE OUR BUILDINGS- ARE DOING THEIR PART TO HELP US ACHIEVE OUR TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE CLIENT TARGETS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU DR LAURA AND I'D LIKE TO THANK ALL OF OUR PANELISTS FOR THEIR REALLY COMPREHENSIVE OVERVIEW. AND FOR HIGHLIGHTING THE WAYS THAT WE CAN ADDRESS MANY OF THESE CHALLENGES. MUCH OF THE FOCUS TODAY HAS BEEN ON BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION AS A SOLUTION. TO DECARBONISATION EFFORTS SO QUESTION THAT I LIKE TO THE MOVIES GET A STAR ON THIS- WOULD BE AND TO WHOEVER FEELS UNCOMFORTABLE JUMPING IN ANSWER TO. A SHOULD ELECTRIFICATION REMAIN A CENTRAL FOCUS IF WE'RE DISCUSSING EXISTING BUILDINGS HOW MIGHT OTHER SOLUTIONS LIKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY RETROFITS AND RENEWABLE GAS OR DOCTOR FRIEDMAN BROUGHT UP HYDROGEN BE IMPLEMENTED ALONGSIDE ELECTRIFICATION TO PROMOTE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION WITH THESE BE GOOD CONCURRENT INVESTMENTS WHY OR WHY NOT. AND THAT'S FOR WHOEVER'S JEREMY BUT I'M I'M WONDERING OUR JUST SORRY IN TERMS OF THE- JUST THE INTERACTION HERE SHALL WE ALL MAYBE PUT OUR CAMERAS ON SO WE CAN ALL KIND OF RESPOND PERHAPS ANYWAY WHO ARE SO I THINK I WANT TO KEEP SOMETHING THAT DOCTOR OR A SAD- WHICH IS THAT TIGHT COORDINATION IS REQUIRED- GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY SECTOR WORKING WITH SPECIFIC PEOPLE THERE ON SPECIFIC YOU KNOW BUILDINGS LOADS THAT ARE ON- IN ONE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA SO WE CAN STRATEGICALLY- INVEST IN ELECTRIC SYSTEM- PRUNING COULD GAS SYSTEM THAT'S THE STRATEGY- AND THAT. DOING SO WILL POTENTIALLY ENABLE- ARE IN G. TO THE EXTENT THAT IT'S AVAILABLE AT SOME VOLUME TO FOCUS ON THE HARDEST TO ELECTRIFY SECTORS OUR OUR BUILDING THE CONVERSATION ASSESSMENT FOUND THAT THAT WAS AFFIXED A RELATIVELY EXPENSIVE STRATEGY- AND THAT THE VOLUME OF IT WAS NOT AS WE CURRENTLY UNDERSTAND THAT ENOUGH TO GET US THE BUGS THAT THAT THRESHOLD- BUT- THE HIGH VALUES THERMAL APPLICATIONS THAT ARE HARD TO ELECTRIFY ACROSS THE STATE PARTICULAR INDUSTRY- AND SOME OTHER- IN USES ARE. PLACES WHERE YOU KNOW WITHOUT GEOGRAPHICAL CORRECT YOU COULD- POTENTIALLY FOCUS THOSE QUEEN MOLECULES WHERE THEY ARE RUNNING THE MOST VALUE- SO AGAIN I CAN'T EMPHASIZE ENOUGH THAT THAT COMMUNITY BASED FIRST- AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND IN TIGHT GEOGRAPHICAL COORDINATION ACROSS THE STATE WITH THE RELEVANT UTILITIES OTHER STAKEHOLDERS IS REALLY KEY. FOR DOING THIS. IN AN OPTIMIZED WHAT THANK YOU PERSICA I LOOKED TO MY TO SEE IF ANYONE ELSE DR COURT. THIS IS THE CHAIR'S SEAT AND HE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT TALLER THAN I HAVE. SO COMMISSION MCALLISTER YOU'RE THE PERSON I'D LIKE TO BRING THESE UP TO- FIRST OF ALL WE'VE TALKED ABOUT NATURAL GAS. THE DIFFICULTY WITH EVEN WITH PHASING OUT PERHAPS A PARTICULAR REGION IS THAT THERE'S A HUGE INFRASTRUCTURE BRINGING NATURAL GAS INTO THE STATE- IT CETERA THE COST OF NATURAL GAS FOR THE REMAINING CUSTOMERS IS JUST GOING TO EXPLODE AND SUPPOSE YOU WERE TO GET RID OF YOU KNOW HALF THE NATURAL GAS SYSTEM THE OTHER HALF WOULD JUST HAVE USED COSTS SO I THINK THERE'S A REAL CONCERN THAT HAS TO BE STUDIED DEEPLY TO UNDERSTAND THIS NOW I ALSO AGREE WITH YOU THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IS NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH OF IT TO DO MORE THAN YOU KNOW REDUCE PERHAPS OVERALL- MIND- METHANE SOMEWHAT BUT NOT A WHOLE LOT- I DO THINK HYDROGEN IS A POTENTIAL ANSWER AND CERTAINLY YOU KNOW I WAS IN NEW ENGLAND WHEN THEY MADE THE TRANSITION FROM COAL GAS TO- NATURAL GAS AND THAT WAS EASY YOU KNOW THEY JUST A FEW VALVES WERE SWITCHED ON- THE HEATING SYSTEMS- COOKING SYSTEM AT CETERA WE DON'T KNOW WITH HYDROGEN WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE. WHETHER OR NOT WILL BE ABLE TO USE CURRENT INFRASTRUCTURE JUST MANY QUESTIONS. THAT NEED TO BE ANSWERED SO BEFORE WE START DOWN THAT PATH WE REALLY NEED TO DO A WHOLE LOT OF WORK. SO WHAT WOULD YOU LIKE US SOME COMMENTARY AROUND THOSE ISSUES. SURE A GREAT GREAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO I WAS BASICALLY TRYING TO GET YOU TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE WELL ABSOLUTELY AND YOU BRING UP SOME SOME CRITICAL ISSUES AND THESE ARE NOT EASY ISSUES THERE ARE STICKY AND THEY DO REQUIRE A- SOCIETY LEVEL- YOU KNOW THESE ARE GENERATIONAL SHIFTS IN THE WAY WE DO THINGS IN CALIFORNIA ALONG THE LINES OF RESTRUCTURING ITSELF FOR. YOU KNOW- YOU KNOW THIS THESE ARE LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE TRANSITIONS THEY HAVE TO HAPPEN OVER MANY YEARS AND DECADES- AND SO. SO I AGREE WITH YOU KNOW I THINK OUR NOTICES SHOWS THAT- AND THAT'S IT IT CORRELATES- WELL WITH WHAT DOCTOR WERE PRESENTED- THAT THERE WERE LIKE ON A TRIP AND THIS IS A PRETTY ROBUST. CONCLUSION REGARDLESS OF THE CHANGES AN ABSOLUTE VOLUMES OF NATURAL GAS PROJECT READ THAT WITH LOTS OF ELECTRIFICATION INCLUDING ON THE TRANSPORTATION SIDE AS WELL AS ELECTRIFICATION OF BUILDINGS. THE THERE WILL BE SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ELECTRIC RATES RIGHT NOW LIKE THE BRITS ARE HIGH IN THE INVESTMENT UTILITY TERRITORIES WILL NOW- AND- GAS RATES ARE RELATIVELY. LOW AND SO WE'RE AT THIS POINT WHERE THERE'S NOT QUITE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE TO EMPHASIZE EFFICIENT I WENT TO THE KITCHEN- BUT- WE'RE ON A TRAJECTORY WHERE THE GAS RATES ARE LIKELY TO GO UP MORE QUICKLY THAN ELECTRIC RATES AND AT SOME POINT THOSE CROSS. SO AGAIN HAVE BEEN DOING THAT AND OPTIMAL WAY REQUIRES VERY A LOT OF ATTENTION- AND A LOT OF BOOKS LOCALIZER SPECIFIC PLANNING. BUT I WILL SAY JUST TO CONCLUDE WE ARE DOING A FAIR AMOUNT A LOT ACTUALLY- HYDROGEN ARE EMPTY AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION ON SOME OF THOSE ISSUES LIKE LANDING IN THE SYSTEM. ARE WORKING WITH SO CAL GAS ON ON SEVERAL PROJECTS THERE'S SOME REALLY GREAT STUFF ON HYDROGEN HAPPENING IN LA PARTICULARLY THE HIGH DEAL. THEY'RE MAKING SOME PROGRESS THERE- BUT AGAIN YOU KNOW IF WE'RE LIMITING THIS TO BUILDINGS- I THINK THEY'RE HARDLY CONVERSATION REALLY IS A BROADER MORE. IN THAT OTHER END USES- WILL KIND OF BE THE FIRST- GATEWAY TO. TO FINDING THOSE HIGH VALUE APPLICATIONS FOR HYDROGEN AND FOR OUR ENERGY. INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION- THE WHITE ALL RIGHT I'LL JUST ONE FINAL O THIS THAT EXTREME AMOUNTS OF MY AND YOU BETTER KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING YOU TRY AND PHASE IT OUT WE ALL AGREE ON THAT- AND RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST A CONCEPT GOING TO BRING UP ONE OTHER POINT. YESTERDAY THE ENERGY INSTITUTE AT HAAS- SEVERIN BORENSTEIN AND JAMES BUSHNELL- GAVE A VERY. INTERESTING WEAPON ARE ESSENTIALLY IT WAS A SYMPOSIUM UNIVERSITY SYMPOSIUM LEVEL TALK ON THE SOCIAL MARGINAL COST OF ELECTRICITY VERSUS NATURAL GAS. C. I'LL SEND YOU ONE AS WELL BUT JUST ASKING I'VE NEVER GOTTEN A QUANTITATIVE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION WHY IS THE PRICE TWICE AS HIGH IF WE UNDERSTOOD AT LEAST WITH OTHER STAND NOT THAT WE COULD NECESSARILY REDUCE IT. NOW THE- THE PROFESSORS BROUGHT ABOUT A NUMBER OF WAYS WHERE WE COULD FIX THE PROBLEM SO ONE OF THEM WAS JUST TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF ELECTRICITY FROM THE GENERAL FUND I DON'T THINK THEY'LL BE TOO MANY VOTES FOR THAT HERE. UNLESS YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE SOME SORT OF A SPECIAL SOURCE OF MONEY- IDEALLY IT WOULD BE FOR THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FUNDS BUT WE ALREADY KNOW THERE ARE MANY MORE CALLS ON THAT MONEY THAN ACTUALLY EXIST ANOTHER WAY TO DO THIS WOULD BE DO- SIMPLY LOOK AT THE COST OF THE FIXED COST VERSUS VARIABLE COST SO ANYONE WHO IS USING ELECTRICITY WOULD PAY THE FIXED COST EVERY MONTH WHICH IS PRETTY HIGH IT'S ABOUT SEVENTY DOLLARS A MONTH BUT THEN YOUR VARIABLE COSTS WOULD GO DOWN BUT IT ANY RIGHT THAT WOULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF THE USE OF ELECTRICITY. BEING LESS EXPENSIVE YOUR YOUR LARGER COST IS PROBABLY THE FIXED COSTS AND THE USE WOULD BE THAN LESS EXPENSIVE YOU'D THEN BE ABLE TO. ELECTRICITY COULD COMPETE PRICE WISE. THAT WAS ONE OF THEIR SUGGESTIONS- FOUGHT SO. HOW DO WE GET THE RIGHT PRICE SIGNAL TO USERS OF ELECTRICITY. SO I'LL JUST VERY BRIEFLY- PROVIDED ONE COMMENT IN PARTICULAR OVER TO RESTAURANTS INTO A PERHAPS AS A AS WELL I WE'RE VERY FAMILIAR WITH WITH SEVEN TO WORK ON THIS I WOULD ACTUALLY HIGHLIGHTED SOME OF OUR BUILDING DECARBONIZATION WORK- FUND IT ALSO INTEGRATE WEEK YES WE INTEGRATE ENERGY COSTS THE REPORT AND- YEAH AND OUR OUR YOU KNOW I THINK THERE ARE THERE'S A VERY LEGITIMATE STRUCTURAL QUESTIONS HERE OF COURSE RATE MAKING IS THAT I'M AT THE RESTAURANT UNTIL THESE BY THE UC AND SO. I DO KNOW THAT THEY ARE. LOOKING AT SHE'S AROUND THIS TOPIC TODAY YEAH AS WELL AS ON BOTH ELECTRIC SIDE EMMA GAS SIDE- I GUESS I AM LOOKING AT SORT OF WHAT THE COMPONENTS OF THE RATE BASE ARE FOR PER NEW INSTALLATIONS OF GAS FOR EXAMPLE. DIGGING INTO SOME OF THOSE ISSUES THAT APPROACH- ARE REFERRED TO- BUT PRICING IS AN ONGOING- SORT OF YOU KNOW DANCE IN THIS REGULATORY ENVIRONMENT THAT- YOU KNOW MONOPOLY. THAT REGULATORY BUT I FULLY REGULATED AND IN THE END THEIR COMMISSIONS- HAVE TO WRESTLE WITH AND I THINK HAVING THIS BROADER CONVERSATION ABOUT OUR POLICY DIRECTION. WILL IS ESSENTIAL TO HELP PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK IN WHICH THAT CAN HELP WITH CLEAR INTENTION TO MEET OUR LONG TERM CARBON REDUCTION GOALS- AND YOU KNOW IN THE STATE WE HAVE ELECTRIC UTILITIES AND GAS UTILITIES AND THOSE TO SOMEHOW NEED TO HAVE A CROSSWALK. SO WHAT WITHOUT ANY PETS THAT'S GOING TO WEAR ON IT THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION RIGHT I'VE ONE LAST QUESTION THE AND THEN I'LL HOWEVER MY COLLEAGUES SO OKAY WITH THE COMPRESSOR RIGHT COULD COULD THAT TIME AND THERE'S A LOT I DIDN'T QUITE GIVE IT A FULL ANSWER THE SECOND ONE ONE THING IN RESPONSE TO ASSEMBLYMEMBER QUIRK'S QUESTION I THINK IT'S A REALLY VALID QUESTION AND THERE'S THAT SORT OF BASIC ISSUE AROUND. WHAT WE INCLUDE AN ELECTRIC RATES AND WHAT WE RECOVER FROM TAXPAYERS OTHER OTHER SOURCES IN OTHER WAYS AND- I THINK IT RELIGION THE QUESTIONS TO BE ASKED ABOUT WHETHER. EVERYTHING WE'RE GETTING FROM ELECTRIC RATES SHOULD BE THERE OR WHETHER YOU KNOW MAYBE THE GENERAL FUND IS THE RIGHT PLACE TO BE LOOKING OR THE G. CARE ACT AS YOU SUGGESTED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WORK- ANOTHER QUESTION THAT- I THINK WE NEED TO GET RIGHT. INVOLVES HOW THE TO THE STRUCTURE OF RATES AND HOW RATES ARE COVERED IN AND PROFESSOR BORNSTEIN AND BUSH KNOWLEDGE MADE SOME INTERESTING SUGGESTIONS THEY'VE ALSO MADE INTERESTING SUGGESTIONS PERSPECTIVE ST ENERGY RESOURCES. RECENTLY. AND I THINK ALL OF THIS ON YOU KNOW WITHOUT ENDORSING YOU I THINK WE NEED TO BE THINKING AS A STATE VERY CAREFULLY BECAUSE WE HAVE FACE SOME REALLY UNPRECEDENTED CRISES IN THE POWER SECTOR AS WE ALL NOW AND WE ALL HAD TO DEAL WITH OVER THE LAST FIVE TO TEN YEARS- DOES IT RAISE COSTS AND WE'RE APPROACHING IN A CERTAIN WAY- AND DOES HAPPEN THOSE COSTS ARE PASSED THROUGH TO RAISE RATES TO RATE PAYERS. AND SO I GUESS THE THING THAT I WOULD SAY THAT THE CLAIM THAT I WOULD STAKE IS THAT WE DO NEED TO BE THINKING HOLISTICALLY AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. MY SENSE IS NOT THE COMMISSION. RCT ENERGY COMMISSION THE P. YOU SEE ANY ISO. ARE WORKING TOGETHER TO TRY TO FIGURE THIS OUT AND TO THINK HOLISTICALLY ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. THE ON BOX FROM RATES THIS YEAR WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IN FURTHERING THAT CONVERSATION. THE STAFF WHITE PAPER IN PARTICULAR ALSO WAS VERY HELPFUL. AND I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION IN CALIFORNIA TRYING TO WORK TOWARD SOLUTIONS BUT IT IS NOT EASY YEAH AND- AND- THAT'S PROBABLY GOOD. YEAH I THINK WE CAN ALL GET RESERVE ID'S SO THE MUCH STATEMENT THE FACT THAT YOU KNOW THE RELATIVE TRAJECTORIES OF GAS ELECTRIC RATES- ACTUALLY CAME FROM THE WORK THAT WAS ELABORATE AROUND THAT ON BALK AT SOME OF THE WORK TO BE DONE. THE COMMISSION SO- SO I THINK THAT MIGHT BE THAT THE- THE ENERGY AGENCIES ARE ACUTELY AWARE OF THIS. AND THE ISSUE OF A LIABILITY THAT IS FUNDAMENTAL TO OUR YEAH AND IT GENERAL I PART OF THE HERE WILL BE POLITICAL AND WHATEVER WE DO- BUT WE'D WE'D APPRECIATE GETTING SOME INFORMATION FROM THE AGENCIES AND SOME SUGGESTIONS ON DIRECTIONS TO GO AND- WE DON'T HAVE THAT EXPERTISE HERE THE FINAL QUESTION I'M GONNA RAISE A CONCERN THAT I KNOW I'VE TALKED WITH THE CHAIROF THE COMMISSION A NUMBER OF TIMES YOU HAVE MANDATED- SOLAR ON NEW BUILDINGS. YOU'RE ABOUT TO MANDATE EVEN MORE SOLAR IF THE NEWS ARTICLES I'M READING ARE CORRECT THE PROBLEM IS AND I KNOW THE P. YOU SEE IS LOOKING AT. AT THE- AT THE WAY IN WHICH SUBSIDIZED BUT IT'S SUBSIDIZED TO A FAIRLY LARGE XM SEVERIN BORENSTEIN ESTIMATES THAT ITS TWO CENTS A KILOWATT HOUR NOW FOR EVERY CUSTOMER. FOR THE SUBSIDY SIMPLY FOR THE RESIDENTIAL MA'AM THAT WE'VE BEEN. DOING AND IT COULD BECOME A LOT LARGER AND I'M HOPING BEFORE YOU MAKE THIS DECISION TO FIRST OF ALL IT'S JUST. CHEAPER TO DO UTILITY SCALE SOLAR AND SO TO MANDATE IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY GIVE US MORE SOLAR ENERGY BECAUSE WE'VE ALREADY SAID WE'RE GOING TO. GO TO A 100% RENEWABLES RELATIVELY AND CHANCES ARE WE'RE GOING TO MOVE THAT DATE UP. EVEN CLOSER TO THE CURRENT TIME SO WE'RE GOING TO GO TO ALL RENEWABLE ENERGY WHY ARE WE THOUGHT WHY THEN ARE YOU AND MAYBE YOU'VE GOT A GOOD REASON I DON'T KNOW. WHY THEY'RE YOU MANDATING THAT THE B. BUT BE DONE IN THE MOST EXPENSIVE WAY POSSIBLE ONE OF OUR BIG PROBLEMS WITH CONVERTING OVER TO ELECTRICITY IS SIMPLY THE HIGH COST. SO THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION I'M I'M VERY FAMILIAR WITH THAT WITH PROFESSOR FOR INSTANCE- VIEWS ON THIS WE HAVE WE HAVE. SOME BACK AND FORTH PERIODICALLY ABOUT THIS- AND I AM. YOU KNOW AS THE LEAGUE COMMISSIONER ON THE BUILDING CODE NO I SHEPHERD THIS THESE PACKAGES EVERY THREE YEARS- AND WE JUST AS YOU KNOW ABOUT THAT. TWENTY TWENTY TWO BUILDING CHARACTER EXPANSE PEAVEY. REQUIREMENT MODESTLY BUT IT DOES EXPAND INTO SOME OF YOUR NON RESIDENTIAL SOME NONRESIDENTIAL CATEGORIES IN ADDITION TO THAT SINGLE FAMILY SO THERE ARE BENEFITS ACTUALLY TO DOING IT IN A DISTRIBUTED WAY VERSUS- UTILITY SCALE AND SO. AND THIS ISN'T AN EITHER OR IT'S- IT'S ABOUT WITH ME AND WE NEED WE NEED LARGE SCALE AND WE NEED DISTRICTS- AND- WE IN THE NEXT FINANCIAL INTO THE NONRESIDENTIAL CATEGORIES WE ACTUALLY HEAR THAT WITH BATTERY SYSTEMS. IN OUR ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THIS IS VERY COST EFFECTIVE UNDER CURRENT RATES CERTAINLY FOR END USERS POSTS BOTH RESIDENTIAL. AND NONRESIDENTIAL- BUT THAT EVEN UNDER SO. WIDE ARRAY OF SCENARIOS FOR FUTURE RIGHTS. GIVEN GIVEN THAT THE DECLINING COSTS OF SOLAR THE IN DECLINE ACROSS THE STORE AS WELL THAT THIS WILL REMAIN THE CASE IN IN NEAR FUTURE IN IN THE LONG TERM WITH THE WITH THESE RESOURCE BEING YES THEY WERE SO I WILL JUST POINT OUT THERE IS A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN THE WAY THAT THOSE SORTS REQUIREMENTS INCLUDING OPINION STORAGE BE PARTICULARLY ARE FIVE AND SO IF THE BUILDING IS- HAS A FOOTPRINT WHAT DOESN'T. ALLOW FOR THAT MUCH SPACE AND THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT MULTI FAMILY AND NON RESIDENTIAL ALLOW FOR SOLAR ON THE ROOF AND THERE ARE SOME EXEMPTIONS THERE. ALSO THERE'S A COST EFFECTIVENESS OUT WHERE. CITY UTILITY OF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT FILES WITH US TO SAY HEY THAT'S NOT COST EFFECTIVE- SO. FOR EXAMPLE IT RATES REALLY JUST. NEVER WENT AWAY COMPLETELY DO I COMPLETELY THAT THERE CAN'T GET THEIR A THERE'S A PATHWAY ACTUALLY GET AN EXAM FOR THAT REQUIREMENT IN THE BUILDING CODE AND THAT'S WE DID THAT WE WORK THROUGH THAT AND SHE WITH STATE SO THERE'S A RESILIENCE TO HAVING DISTRIBUTED ENERGY RESOURCES- IF THAT DOES HAVE VALUE- AND SO OVER TIME AS WE HAVE BOTH SMALL SCALE DISTRIBUTED SOLAR STORAGE. AND AGREE THAT WE ALSO NEED LARGE SCALE- YEAH WHICH STORAGE AS WELL- WILL WILL BE- ON BOTH ENDS OF THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE MORE ROBUST- GREAT WELL DO YOU HAVE A STUDY THAT SHOWS WHAT THE SAVINGS ARE BY PUTTING IT ON A ROOF AS OPPOSED TO OUR OR AT LEAST THE COST TRADE OFFS BECAUSE FRANKLY I DON'T BELIEVE YOU'RE GOING TO BE SAFE ABLE TO SAVE MUCH IN TRANSMISSION AND DISTRIBUTION BECAUSE YOU HAVE THE LOCAL SOLAR IF ANYTHING THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE YOU'RE GENERATING THAT AT THE WRONG TIME OF DAY. AND THE OTHER THING IS YOU'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE RENTAL HOMES LIKE THE ONE I LIVE IN I LIVE IN A LARGE RENTAL. APARTMENT AND YEAH BE SUBSIDIZING THE HOMEOWNERS AND I JUST DON'T THINK THAT'S FAIR BUT IF YOU CAN SHOW ME ECONOMICALLY WILL WORK PLEASE SEND ME THE INFORMATION  WE DO KNOW IS THAT FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF THE CONSUMER UNDER A VAST ARRAY OF. SO- BUT I'M HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN A DEEPER DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS- WHAT IS THE TO STOP BECAUSE I THINK WE JUST GO BACK AND FORTH WITH THAT. WE NEED SOMETHING QUANTITATIVE BUT I WILL SAY THIS IS ONLY COST EFFECTIVE FOR THE PEOPLE TO BUY SOLAR BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE PAY THE COSTS AND I THINK WE COULD GO BACK AND FORTH ON THIS BUT UNLESS WE GET SOMETHING QUANTITATIVE. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE AN ANSWER. AND IF I COULD I'M ACTUALLY I DON'T YEAH I THINK IT'S- A BIG DOCTOR COURT PUT A NICE FIVE POINT ON THAT AND I THINK IT IS REQUIRE FOR PROBABLY SOME ADDITIONAL CONVERSATION IF I COULD GO AND I AND I WILL GIVE. ALL OF YOU A CHANCE TO MAKE SOME CLOSING COMMENTS IF YOU CAN MAYBE HOLD. YOUR THOUGHT OF THAT BECAUSE I DO WANT TO TURN TO SOME OF THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO DO HAVE QUESTIONS THAT THEY'D LIKE TO DEPOSE AND SO SURE RIVAS THE FLOOR IS YOURS. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PANELISTS TOWN FOR THEIR PRESENTATIONS AND- THIS OPPORTUNITY TO THINK OF WHAT. HOW DO WE DECARBONISE EXISTING BUILDINGS- THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN THINKING OF IN. YOU KNOW I HAVE BEEN FOCUSED THIS YEAR. ON IN EXTREME HEAT- BELL BUT- STRATEGY FOR THE STATE- THANK YOU TO JOSE- FOR BRINGING THAT UP- DURING HIS PRESENTATION OF BECAUSE I HAVE BEEN THINKING ABOUT HEAT THIS YEAR AND VERY TIMELY BECAUSE OF THE RECENT HEAT WAVES ALL OVER. I'M NOT JUST IN OUR STATE- BUT YOU KNOW IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY THAT. TRADITIONALLY DO NOT HAVE- EXTREME ENDS FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THE COOLING SIDE OF D. CARBON IT DECARBONIZING BUILDINGS AND I KNOW SOME OF YOU TALKED ABOUT HEAT PUMPS AND OTHER ALTERNATIVES TO AIR A LOT OF- RESIDENTS. AND BUILDINGS THATDON'T HAVE AIR CONDITIONING RIGHT NOW AND I THINK OF THAT A LOT OF THE LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS- THAT ARE LEAST LIKELY TO HAVE UNFORTUNATELY HAVE ANY TYPE OF COOLING. I'VE AND- AND IF WE THINK OF A STRATEGY OF LIKE OKAY HOW DO WE PROVIDE COOLING. I DON'T THINK IT NECESSARILY HAS TO BE AIR CONDITIONING I THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE. BOTH GOALS RIGHT OF THE DECARBONIZING EXISTING BUILDINGS AND- PROVIDING. COOLING YOU KNOW AND I AND BECAUSE OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE HEALTH EFFECTS. OF SO OF IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW I THINK OF AN OPPORTUNITY OF EXISTING BUILDINGS MAYBE WHEN THEY'RE LOOKING TO UPGRADE OR THEY HAVE TO REPLACE THEIR EXISTING- AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM WHAT CAN WE DO TO IN EITHER INCENTIVIZE OR PROMOTE- ANOTHER FORM OF CHOLINE OR DO WE NEED MORE RESEARCH IN THIS AREA OF. NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL REPLACE OUR EXISTING AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEMS THAT'S THOSE ARE SYSTEMS THAT THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE INNOVATION OVER THE YEARS RIGHT I IMAGINE THIS IS THE SAME WAY THAT WE CALL THE BUILDING THAT WE DID FIFTY YEARS AGO AND SO I'M JUST CURIOUS ON. COMMENTS ON BACK FROM ANY OF THE PANELISTS. HOLDEN OKAY NOW SHOULD I WAIT PLEASE JUMP IN I THANK THE REVIEWER REFERENCED IN THE CHASE- ADDITIONAL COMMENTS YEAH JERRY WEST THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION COMMENTS AROUND EXTREME HEAT AND AGAIN WOULD ACKNOWLEDGE ALL YOUR WORK ON THE ISSUE- I THINK. YEAH IT IS EXTREME HEAT IS UP YOU KNOW SOMETHING IS CHANGING FAST AND IT'S ONLY GONNA GET WORSE SO I AGREE THAT- TAKING DIFFERENT STRATEGIES AND APPROACH IT FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES IS IMPORTANT WAITED TO TACKLE RIGHT AND I THINK. YOU KNOW WHEN I UP LATE- SO THE WORK THAT YOU ALL ARE DOING AND SAID HI NAY PAN RIGHT IT THINK IT'S FOR COMMUNITY CENTER- AND WE THINK THAT'S THAT'S A GOOD APPROACH RIGHT SPECIALLY BURKE- YOU KNOW SOME MEDIUM LONG TERM RIDLEY TENSELY SIX FORTUNATELY RIGHT BUT IF WE THINK IN ADDITION TO THAT- YOU KNOW AT THAT. KEEP ON SPACE HEATING BE THAT SHORT TERM RELIEF TO LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES TO YOUR POINT RIGHT SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO. WAIT FOR THAT KIND OF RETREAT RIGHT AS THINGS GET WORSE ESPECIALLY IN PLACES WHERE THEY NEED IT ALL RIGHT- AND I THINK- GOING BACK TO THE- DOCTOR WORKERS AND WEBER WORKS COMMENTS AND KEEP MY SPACE IN IT RIGHT UP SOME OF THE ATHLETES STUDIES DEMONSTRATE- CLEARLY IN THERE THAT YOU KNOW THERE IS. OUT. YEAH EITHER SOME STATE OR A TO FOUR DOLLARS WHEN YOU HAVE IT HE PUTS BASS AND ENCONTRA TO THE TRADITIONAL SO I THINK PER I BRING THAT UP TO THAT WHY THERE'S A FOCUS YOU KNOW ON PLANTS BECAUSE WE FEEL LIKE THAT THE DISCUSS IT'S SOMETHING WHERE IS SOMETHING THAT AND OUT MUCH EASIER RIGHT IN AND WORK OUT MY BETTER FOR BOTH THAT NEED MOST WENT OF HEAT OF SPACE AND SO WE THAT'S WHY IT'S IN ORDER TO GET THE MARKET GOING. TO GET THAT WORKFORCE- AND THE STABILITY. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE ACROSS THAT DR WHERE ANOTHER STOP ON TERMS OF THAT SEXUAL TRIMMING. WE THINK HE FARMS ARE ONE WAY TO KIND OF START INVESTING FUNDING NOT ONLY TO KIND OF GET TO THAT LONG TERM APPROACH THAT'S THE BEST APPROACH- BUT ALSO TO START. BUILDING THAT MARKET INSTABILITY NOW IN PROVIDING THOSE BENEFITS THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT MOST- SO I HOPE THAT. YOU KNOW INTEREST YOUR QUESTION ON THIS BUT I THINK THAT SPEAKING WITH. CORPORATE ANY OTHER MEMBERS INCLUDING YOURSELF REQUESTED THE FOURTEENTH ISSUE THANK YOU I GAVE THOSE AND I THINK THIS OF WE HAVE TO CA WORKING ON IT AND INVOLVING- GROUPS THAT REPRESENT ESPECIALLY VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES AND AS YOU MENTIONED LIKE THE GROUPS THAT ARE WORK THAT HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THE COMMUNITY RESILIENCE HUBS I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO. TO ALSO EDUCATE OUR PEOPLE ON OF MORE EFFICIENT TECHNOLOGIES FOR COOLING AND HEATING SO THANK YOU. ANY OTHER MEMBERS THAT WOULD LIKE TO POSE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. I JUST SAID- AND THEN WE'LL GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT I JUST HAD A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS REAL QUICK FOR MISS KUMAR- WATER IN YOUR ESTIMATION THE MAJOR COST BARRIERS AND IMPACTS TO RENTERS AND LOW INCOME FAMILIES. AND HOUSEHOLDS WHEN ELECTRIFYING MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS AND THEN-AND THEN AND THE FOLLOW UP QUESTION IS WHAT WOULD YOU SUGGEST OR ARE THERE ANY CHALLENGES TO DECARBONISING MULTI FAMILY HOMES FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING UNITS. THAT CAN BE ADDRESSED BY THE LEGISLATURE. YET HERE ARE SOME OF THE MAJOR SEARCH ON THE NEW CONSTRUCTION SITE BE ARE SAYING THAT IT'S LARGELY COST NEUTRAL FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING DEVELOPERS TO DO THIS WORK AND ON THE NEW CAR- ON THE EXISTING BUILDING SIDE JUST A SHORT AMOUNT OF WORK AND THE LIMITED OPERATING BUDGET THAT THEY'RE ALL CHAD ITSELF POSES A PROBLEM. AND AS I SAID I THINK OF THE WEIGHT AFFORDABLE HOUSING FINANCING SYSTEM IS SET UP IS PROBLEMATIC AS WELL BECAUSE IN A LOT OF INSTANCES BRANCH YOU OF SWITCHING CAN GET COMPLICATED AND TRICKY WHERE ESPECIALLY IN CENTRAL DOMESTIC OPERATOR HEATING IS WHERE WE ARE SEEING AN ISSUE RIGHT NOW IN EXISTING BUILDINGS. SO TO REPLACE THAT THERE SEEMS TO BE A LOT MORE WORK THAT'S NEEDED AND LAUDABLE AS IT REALLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT WORK AND I THINK ONE OF TE BIGGEST CHALLENGES JUST GETTING FUNDING TO COVER AT LEAST A PORTION OF IT. AND I WOULD SAY SO THE MAIN BATTERY ENERGY SOMETIMES A COST FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING PROVIDERS HAS JUST BEEN. YOU KNOW AS A SWAPPING OUT CENTER MYSTIC OPERATING SYSTEMS. AND DAUGHTERS DATA COMMITTEES IS JUST PROVIDING A LOT MORE FUNDING TO COVER THAT COST WHAT IT IS TO COVER GAPS FUNDING. AND AS I SAID PANEL UPGRADES AND TRANSFORM UPGRADE THROUGH EARLY OF COULD THE COST CAME TO SURFACE PROJECT APPEARS TO BE FEASIBLE AND WILL BE UTILIZED THAT. YOU KNOW THEY HAVE TO CHANGE THAT PROBLEM WHICH IN A LOT OF OLDER PROPERTIES WHICH IS A LOT OF EXISTING MULTI FAMILY STOCK. IT IS REALLY OLD AND FUNDS NEED TO BE UPGRADED AND WE'RE SEEING THAT THE COST IS JUST JUMPING ALL OVER THE PLACE SO WE DON'T HAVE A STEADY OP OPERATING UP AND LOOKED AT COST. AND WE ARE I THINK. WE HEARD IT BEFORE. I THINK REALLY ALSO FIGURING OUT YOU'RE NOT AN ELECTRIC FRIENDLY IT WOULD HELP. HONEST CONSIDER THAT LONG TERM OPERATING COST AND SEE POSITIVE OUT INCOME FLOW. AND THAT COULD REALLY MORE TO READ MOTIVATE THEM TO DO SOME OF THE WORK. ASK WOULD RESIDENTS I THINK THIS IS JUST A VERY CRITICAL UPGRADE AND CHANGE REQUESTS SPOKE ABOUT IT I THINK IT'S NO LONGER A QUESTION OF WHETHER WE CAN ELECTION FIVE THAT WE CAN. PUT IN SOME OF THESE ARE PLANS IS GENERALLY ESSENTIAL. FOR YOU KNOW LOW INCOME RENTERS TO JUST LIVE IN THEIR HOME ESPECIALLY AT A TIME LIKE THIS WHERE YOU KNOW GOING OUT IS NOT AN OPTION. FOR A LOT OF COMMUNITIES BECAUSE OF THE HEALTH CARE IS THAT GOING ON CLOSES EITHER BY FIRES ON MICHAEL WITH. SO A LOT OF. RESIDENTS I JUST SPENDING TIME MANAGEMENT I THINK. YOU KNOW IF THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT I THINGS LIKE INSTALLING HEAT BOUNDS OF INSTALLING. AT CONDITIONING I JUST THINK AND THIS TIME THEY'RE JUST FOR THE PAST LOW BASS SO I THINK EARLY GOOD TRAITS AND REALLY GOOD BATES THE WAY FARM TO THAT ACTIVITY AND. THEY WERE TRICKED HER PRE SHOULD MYSTERY IS ALL GOING BE CHAO ACROSS THE BOARD AND CERTAINLY PAYING ATTENTION TO THE- DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT IT COULD HAVE ON LOW INCOME FAMILIES AND RENTERS WHO CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE INTEGRATING PROPERLY IN THE MODELING AS WE GO FORWARD- I SEE NO OTHER CHERISHED IT'S THEIR PANEL JOSH GREEN NOT MASS MARRIAGES I JUST WANTED TO WEIGH AND- AND ECHO MY FELLOW PANELISTS UP REMARKS AS RELATES TO A MULTI FAMILY HOUSING- YOU KNOW WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE A QUICK MATH- THE PUMP- CENTRAL HEAT PUMP EQUIPMENT- THAT IS- BEING UTILIZED AND MULTI FAMILY- INSTALLATIONS NOT ONLY IN CALIFORNIA BUT- IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND THERE'S SOME OTHER MANUFACTURERS AS WELL THAT. I HAVE A QUICK MATH- BUT THE UNDERLYING FINANCING AND WHEN I HAD REFERENCED- IN MY OPENING REMARKS AND THOSE INCENTIVES ARE KEY- BECAUSE IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT NASCENT TECHNOLOGY BUT ALSO LIMITED- IN FIELD APPLICATIONS IN THESE INSTALLATIONS SO WE'RE STILL LEARNING. RIGHT AS AN INDUSTRY- AND ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT- GREAT ENABLE TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS- ESPECIALLY FOR LOAD SHIFTING- THAT- CAN CERTAINLY HELP THIS WITHOUT WRITTEN BALANCES THE PROVERBIAL ETCETERA BUT I JUST WANT TO HAVE A CERTAINLY ECHO AND REITERATE THAT THE FINANCING MECHANISMS AND FLEXIBILITY THERE ARE GOING TO BE AN VERY IMPORTANT- WE GET A LOT OF FEEDBACK IN THIS REGARD NATIONALLY WITH- ARCHITECTS SPECIFYING ENGINEERS THAT WE WORK WITH IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR- THAT'S KEY AND ONE OF THE THINGS. THAT- COMMISSIONER CALLOUS THERE TALKED EARLIER ON WITH PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE BEEN ASKED- TESTS TO EXPLORE AND THINK ABOUT. IT IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE ENERGY SERVICE COMPANY MODEL RIGHT ESCO MODEL IN TERMS OF- ENERGY EFFICIENCY UPGRADES TO BUILDINGS ARE MOSTLY IN THE COMMERCIAL SECTOR AND- PROVERBIAL MUSH MARKET RIGHT NOW A SIMPLE UNIVERSITIES SCHOOLS HOSPITALS IS THERE A ROLE FOR THAT TYPE OF- FINANCING. OF CORPORATE PARADIGM FOR MULTI FAMILY HOUSING ESPECIALLY FOR- SMALLER OWNERS OF MULTI FAMILY HOUSING- THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE AN INCENTIVIZED- IN TERMS OF A LEASING MODEL. SO AGAIN YOU KNOW FROM A FROM A MANUFACTURER STANDPOINT AND IN THE FIELD EXPERIENCE THAT WE HAVE NOW THE TECHNOLOGY IS THERE AND IT'S BEGINNING TO GROW AND ADAPT AND INNOVATE- BUT TO REALLY- MAKE UP BREAK AND A MULTI HOUSE IN OUR DAUGHTER INCOME TO- WITH WITH RENTERS WE'RE GOING TO NEED SOME MORE FLEXIBILITY ON THE FINANCING PARADIGMS THANK YOU A TOFU PERSICA I WILL NOW MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT- DO WE HAVE BY LOOKING AROUND I DON'T SEE ANYONE IN THE GALLERY WHO'S HERE TO PROVIDE COMMENT- WILL MOVE ON TO WITNESSES WAITING TO PROVIDE PUBLIC COMMENT VIA TELECONFERENCE SERVICE DUE TO ONGOING CO IN NINETEEN SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS WE WILL NEED TO PLACE A TIME LIMIT ON PUBLIC TESTIMONY I'M NOT SURE HOW MANY WE HAVE IN THE QUEUE NOT IN THE QUEUE OKAY SO WE CAN- SKIP OVER THE- WITNESS PRESENTATIONS THE MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROP DANNY INDIVIDUALS WHO WERE- ON LINE WE WERE LIKE 2% PUBLIC COMMENT IF ANY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR LIKE THAT HAVE PUBLIC COMMENT YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AGAIN THAT'S ONE AND THEN ZERO FOR ANY PUBLIC COMMENT. AND WE HAVE ABOUT TWELVE IN Q. AND WE WILL GO TO LINE THIRTY YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANK YOU MICHAEL BOOKER TOMORROW ON THE AFTER THE ACT UNDER G. CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE DISCUSSION AND- WHAT WEFULLY RECOGNIZE THAT MOST OF THE DISCUSSION TODAY HAS BEEN ON THE RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDING SECTOR. THERE HAS BEEN- REPEATED MENTION- IN THIS DISCUSSION AND OTHER DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE ABOUT THE MANUFACTURING. AND FOOD PROCESSING SECTOR A SECTOR THAT'S OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE HARD TO ELECTRIFY SECTOR CALIFORNIA. ANDI REALLY WANT TO FOCUS MY COMMENTS ON THAT- I NOTICED BIG SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA GAS COMPANY HAS CONTINUED TO PRESS THE ISSUE OF DECARBONISATION OF THE PIPELINE. AS A SOLUTION AND I THINK I AGREE WITH MR QUIRK THAT IT MAY HAVE SOME. RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS MAY HAVE SOME LIMITED CAPACITY AND RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. IT IS NOT- RENEWABLE GAS IS NOT I REPEAT A SOLUTION IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR. RENEWABLE GASES FIVE TO TEN TIMES MORE EXPENSIVE CONTENTION. CONVENTIONAL FOSSIL GAS. AND IT'S JUST NOT AN ECONOMIC SOLUTION UNLIKE THE GAS COMPANY WE DON'T GET TO PASS ON A 100% OF OUR COPS. WE CERTAINLY DON'T GET A GUARANTEED RATE OF RETURN OF MADE. IF WE DID WE WOULDN'T BE HAVING THIS DISCUSSION RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO COMPETE AND SO IT'S GOING TO BE VERY IMPERATIVE AS. WE MOVE DOWN THIS PATH I SINGLE LECTURE CASE AND RENEWABLE ARE NOT SOLUTIONS IN THE HARD TO ELECTRIFY SECTOR BECAUSE OF COST AND OTHER CONSIDERATIONS. WE NEED TO FIND SOLUTIONS FOR THAT SECTOR THAT OUR ECONOMIC AN OLD LOVE THE SECTORS TO CONTINUE TO PROSPER HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR VIEWS HOPEFULLY WE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH THAT DISCUSSION RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO PLAY THIS GAME. THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS AND DECARBONISATION PIPELINE IS GOING TO BE A- SOLUTION FOR US. AND THEN FINALLY ELECTRIC RATES ARE MORE THAN DOUBLE P. JUNE ELECTRIC RATES ARE QUICKLY MOVING TOWARDS THREE TIMES THE NATIONAL AVERAGE BUT THE- LATEST RATE INCREASE PROPOSALS THEY'VE UNVEILED IN THE CONCEPT OF UNDERGROUNDING TEN. THOUSAND MILES OF THEIR TRANSMISSION LINES. WHICH WILL COST AN ESTIMATED THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S THE SAME PRICE TAG BUT I THINK YOU HEARD PROFESSOR LAURA. PUT ON- THE- ELECTRIFICATION OF ALL BUILDINGS IN THE STATE SO. THAT'S A HUGE CONCERN FOR US AND WE NEED TO GET ELECTRICITY PRICES UNDER CONTROL AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU STE. OUR NEXT RECORD. THANK THANK YOU WELCOME A YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANK YOU GERALDINE ENSURE RIVAS- I'M PAUL BREMER WITH THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION IN BACK IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN CBRE SPONSORED STUDY THAT LOOKED AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION POTENTIAL OF NEW HOMES VERSUS EXISTING HOMES. MY IS THE CIVIC LEE- WE LOOKED AT THE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS THAT COULD BE MADE FROM A FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN A NEW HOME- BUILT IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN- VERSUS A SIMILAR HOME IT WAS CONSTRUCTED IN NINETEEN NINETY AND THE RESULTS WERE STUNNING- THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT RESULTED IN EIGHT. TIMES THE GHG REDUCTIONS. AND THE OLDER HOME THEN IN THE NEW ONE. AND KEEP IN MIND THE STUDY WAS DONE EIGHT YEARS AGO- INTO GERMAN HOLDEN'S POINT- WE ONLY LOOKED AT ENERGY EFFICIENCY BACK THERE- I REALIZE A LECTOR VACATION HAS REALLY COME ON STRONG RECENTLY BUT- AT THE TIME WE DID THIS STUDY WE ONLY LOOKED AT ENERGY EFFICIENCY. AND KEEP IN MIND ALSO THAT THE CDC HAS UPDATED ITS ENERGY RAW STANDARDS THREE MORE TIMES- INCLUDING THE ROOFTOP SOLAR MANDATE THAT TOOK EFFECT. IN JANUARY OF TWENTY TWENTY SO- WHY WE'VE YET TO UPDATE THE STUDY I IT'S SAFE TO ASSUME. THAT THE SAME FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR INVESTMENT TODAY WOULD READ FAR GREATER RESULTS- THAN IT DID IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN NOW CAN WE REDO A FURTHER REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS A NEW HOMES OF COURSE- IT'S JUST GOING TO COST A LOT MORE- DUE TO DIMINISHING RETURNS. AND IS COMMISSION MCALISTER'S ALREADY SAID THERE'S ENORMOUS GHG REDUCTION POTENTIAL AND THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK- WE ALREADY KNOW THAT AND IF THE STAFF IS POINTED. OUT IN THEIR- BACKGROUND PAPER THERE ARE SIMPLE IN VERY LOW THINGS THAT CAN BE TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AND OLDER HOMES AND APARTMENTS- COCKING IN CEILING WINDOWS DOORS WALLS- PUTTING IN INSULATION WRAP ON THE WATER HEATER- AND CHECKING THE DUCKS SYSTEM- FOR LEAKS. ALL OF THESE ARE VERY LOW COST ITEMS BUT HAVE HUGE- REDUCTION POTENTIAL BOTH GHG- INTO YOUR ENERGY BILL AND REDUCING THE ENERGY BILL OF COURSE- MEANS MORE MONEY IN THE POCKET FOR THE CONSUMER- AND ALSO IS- COMMISSION MCALLISTER SAID. A COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE STAKEHOLDERS ASSEMBLY KEY TO THE SUCCESS. WE NEED TO IMPLEMENT A WAY TO KEEP TRACK OF WHAT UPGRADES ARE BEING MADE TO THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK- AND PERHAPS DO SOMETHING WHAT WE'RE ALREADY DOING IN TERMS OF OUR REGISTRY- WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN NEW HOME CONSTRUCTION. BUT IF WE DON'T KEEP TRACK. OF WHAT WE'RE DOING IN THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK TEN YEARS DOWN THE ROAD WE'RE GONNA BE WONDERING WHERE DO WE NEED TO BE- MAKING THE CHANGES AND WHAT CHANGES NEED TO BE MADE AND LASTLY WE ALSO NEED TO ENSURE THAT THE UPGRADES TO THE EXISTING BUILDINGS ARE CORRECTLY DONE AND ARE INSPECTED BY THE LOCAL BUILDING DEPARTMENTS. THIS IS BEEN ALL HORRIBLE PROBLEM OVER THE PAST DECADE- ABOUT TEN YEARS AGO- WE HELP THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING OFFICIALS- DO A SURVEY AND WE FOUND- THAT UP TO TEN THOUSAND. AIR CONDITIONING UNITS THAT WERE SOLD IN THE LA BASIN. FOUR HUNDRED EIGHTY FIVE HAD PERMITS TAKEN OUT WHEN THEY WERE INSTALLED THAT'S LESS THAN 5% OF THE TOTAL- AND THAT NEEDS TO CHANGE SO IN CLOSING C. B. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR WORK WITH THE CDC. THE LEGISLATURE AND GROUPS LIKE ENERGY SEE- TO REDUCE GHG EMISSIONS AND BOTH NEW AND ESPECIALLY THE EXISTING HOUSING STOCK THANK YOU. THANK YOU I'M GOING TO I'M I BELIEVE THAT THE PREVIOUS TWO SPEAKERS WERE PART OF A MAKING OF A MORE STATED PRESENTATION- I'M GOING TO SUGGEST GOING FORWARD THAT. EACH PUBLIC COMMENT SPEAKER HAS NO MORE THAN TWO MINUTES- TO SHARE THEIR THOUGHTS ARE ASKED A QUESTION. MODERATOR THANK YOU MEXICO. TICKETS NEED MEXICO LINE OF NINETEEN YOUR LINE IS OPEN THANK YOU CHAIRED HOLDEN RELAPSE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS YALI AFRICAN I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS WE HAVE THE YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO REVIEW THE COPPER HAS THE LETTER THAT WAS SUBMITTED LAST WEEK FOR THIS HEARING. OTHER IS ALREADY BEEN CONSIDERABLE DIALOGUE TODAY REGARDING THE COST OF ELECTRICITY AND HEAT PUMP TECHNOLOGY SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO USE THIS MOMENT TO HIGHLIGHT ONE ADDITIONAL IMPORTANT POINT. WE ALSO MAKE OUR WATER I TO BEGIN I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE CURRENT MEDIAN PRICE OF A HOME IN CALIFORNIA IS OVER EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS MAKING THE STATE'S HOUSING MARKET ALARMINGLY UNAFFORDABLE. THE PURSUIT OF ELECTRIFYING EXISTING HOME TO BE A RETROFIT ON RETAIL PROGRAM. WILL ONLY DRIVE UP HOME SALES PRICES AND FURTHER FRUSTRATE THE HOME BUYING PROCESS. AND YOU KNOW AND AS WE HEARD MAJOR POINTS. REPLACEMENTS WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL WORK. SUCH AS AN ELECTRICAL PANEL UPGRADES. WHICH INVOLVES FINDING BIDDING AND SCHEDULING A PROFESSIONAL CONTRACTOR INSTALLATION TIME AND THEN A GOVERNMENT INSPECTION. THE TIME TO COMPLETE ANY UPGRADES OR REPAIRS NEGOTIATED IN A REAL ESTATE TRANSACTION IS ALREADY NARROWLY CONSTRAINED BY THE WINDOW OF TIME. OFFERED BY BUYERS FINANCING COMPANY. WHICH IS OFTEN ONLY A THIRTY DAY WINDOW. TO ADDING ANY REQUIREMENTS OR TRANSACTIONAL PUT LOWER AND MIDDLE CLASS CALIFORNIANS A DISADVANTAGE. AND THOSE WHO ARE PAYING CASH FOR HAVE A SUBSTANTIAL DOWN PAYMENT WILL HAVE MORE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY OVER THOSE USING CONVENTIONAL. FINANCING FOR FHA LOANS IN ADDITION THE REGION AND ONGOING AND MATERIAL SHORTAGES AND SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES HAVE PUT IN SHARP RELIEF. NEED TO SHOP FACTORS THAT WERE ADDED TO THE DELAYS AND INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED SOCIAIS DID WITH HOME SALES BASED RETROFIT MANDATE. TO CONCLUDE THINKING IN MIND THAT AS YOU MOVE FORWARD ANY RETROFIT ON RESELL MANDATE ARE GUARANTEED TO NOT ONLY PRIVATE HOUSING PROJECT COSTS. BUT WILL ALSO SEVERELY DISRUPT THE ABILITY FOR AVERAGE CALIFORNIANS SUCCESSFULLY BY HOME THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION THANK YOU. MAX SPEAKER. GILBERT TO LINE THIRTY FIVE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO POLLING IS VERY INFORMATIVE HEARING TOGETHER I BOUGHT THANKS TO MAKE UP HALF THE PENINSULA CLEAN ENERGY JOINT POWERS ABILITY TWENTY CITIES TOWNS IN THE COUNTY BUT A COMMUNITY CHOICE AGGREGATOR PROGRAM. INSANITARY COUNTY EXPANDING A LOS PONTOS ANDERSON COUNTY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. ACCURATE IN THAT CASE BACKGROUND DOCUMENT THE ELECTRICITY SUPPLIED TO BUILDING STATEWIDE WHICH CURRENTLY CREATED CONTRIBUTED.

WORKING CLOSELY WITH HOMEOWNERS LANDLORDS AND TENANTS TO ELECTRIFY THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK IT'S IN FAMILY HOMES MULTI UNIT DWELLINGS AND COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS OPERATING INCOME ON OUR WEBSITE HOW TO DECARBONISE HOME WRITING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE DESIGNERS AND FACILITY MANAGERS. MANAGERS ON ALL ELECTRIC BUILDING TECHNOLOGIES AND WORKING WITH THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ON BUILDING CODES TO ADVANCE EDUCATION IN NEW AND EXISTING BUILDINGS. IN ADDITION THE INFORMATION PROPER REBATES TO A RESIDENTIAL CUSTOMERS REPLACE THEIR NECK AND GAS WATER HEATERS. PARTISAN CENTERS FOR ELECTRICAL PANEL UPGRADES AND ADD ON INCENTIVES FOR CHARACTER CUSTOMERS. WE KNOW WE NEED TO DO MORE OUR NEXT AVAILABLE OKAY DRESSING A CHALLENGE OF RENTAL UNITS SO DEVELOPING A PILOT. THREE TO THE NEWS ON THE FINANCE EDUCATION AT CALTRAIN NOTED EARLIER. ON BILL FINANCING SHOWS A LOT OF PROMISE AS FINANCING COULD BE TIED TO THE METER AND SURVIVE CUSTOMER TURNOVER. BUT WE NEED A SCALED FINANCE SCHOOL TO MAKE BUILDING RETROFITS PORTABLE. LASTLY AGREE WITH SEVERAL OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY PALESTINIAN ALL HANDS ON DECK APPROACH. COOPERATION COORDINATION WHAT ARE COME HIGHER USE BY BOTH PRIVATE AND PUBLIC AND BUT FOR THE COMMITTEE TIRE BANSURI CALIFON GOALS FOR CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY HER THANK YOU NEXT OF A LINE OF THIRTY ONE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS BRAXTON BRIDGERS AND I'M CALLING ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION FOR ENERGY AFFORDABILITY ALSO KNOWN AS A WE ARE A FIVE OH ONE C. THREE NONPROFIT TECHNICAL SERVICES AND TRAINING ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO ACHIEVING ENERGY EFFICIENCY. GREEN BUILDING PRACTICES AND DEPLOYMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY RESOURCES AND NEW AND EXISTING MULTI FAMILY BUILDINGS. OUR PORTFOLIO PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNITY SERVICES LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM FOR MULTI FAMILY ALSO KNOWN AS LIVE LET. AND APPLY WITH MULTI FAMILY PROGRAM IS A STATEWIDE GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION PROGRAM SUPPORTED BY CAP AND TRADE DOLLARS OFFERS INCENTIVES TO PERFORM DEEP ENERGY RETROFITS AND SOLAR PEAVEY INSULATION. LOW INCOME HOUSEHOLDS. SUCH WORK IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE NET ZERO EMISSIONS AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IN A MANNER THAT IS EQUITABLE AND WHAT'S MORE CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE. WE HELD THE FACT OF CLIMATE CHANGE IN THE FORM OF EXTREME HEAT. AS HE WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE STATE SERIOUS ILLNESSES AND DEATHS RELATED TO UNPRECEDENTED TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE. AND THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WILL PERCENT. FORTUNATELY CALIFORNIA HAS A POLICY WORLD MAP WITH WHICH TO GROUND ITS WORK TOWARD CARBONITE IN THE BUILDING SECTOR. RECENTLY THE CDC RELEASED A BUILDING DECARBONIZATION ATTACHMENT COMPLETE WITH STRATEGIES THAT WILL LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS IN THE STATE AND CONTINUED FUNDING OF DECARBONISATION PROGRAMS IS ESSENTIAL TO THE REALIZATION OF CALIFORNIA'S EMISSION REDUCTION GOALS. WITHOUT THE CORPORATE THE LEGISLATURE AT THE STATE BUILDING SECTOR WILL NOT BE ABLE TO UNDERTAKE THE SUBSTANTIAL. ACHIEVABLE TASK OF RAPIDLY ELIMINATING EMISSIONS FROM THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK EIGHTY EIGHT COMMITTED TO CONTINUING OUR WORK AND PROVIDING AFFORDABLE SOLUTIONS TO DECARBONISE THE RESIDENTIAL BUILDING SECTOR. AND WE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS CRITICAL CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU I CAN TELL THE IT SEEMS LIKE MOST WHO ARE GOING TO BE PRESENTING THEIR- PUBLIC COMMENT HAVE PREPARED STATEMENTS IT APPEARS. AND I'M GOING TO ASK ONCE AGAIN- IF. YOU CAN MODIFY IT TO TWO MINUTES I'M TRYING TO CUT ANYONE OFF BUT I WILL APPRECIATE IF YOU CAN MODIFY YOUR YOUR COM TO FIT A TOMB TIME FRAME. THANK YOU. NEXT WEEK YOU ANNEX ABOUT THE LINE OF THIRTY NINE PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR HOLDEN JERRY BUSS AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS THIS IS MARIAN BERGESON WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL THANK YOU FOR DROPPING THIS IMPORTANT TOPIC- I JUST WANT YOU KNOW TO POINT IN RESPONSE TO THE PRESENTATION TODAY ONE IS- AROUND AND CHERRY BUT- CHERRY THIS IS LEADERSHIP ON COOLING. I THINK THE ANY TIME THE LEGISLATOR THANKS ABOUT COOLING THEY SHOULD THINK ABOUT HEATING AS WELL HE PUMPS CAN DO BOTH THERE'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY IN ALL THE NEW COOLING THAT'S GOING INTO HOMES OR NEW COOLING THAT'S NEEDED- TO HAVE HEATING THERE AS WELL AND THEREBY DISPLACE. THE FOSSEL- HEATING SOURCES IN HOME SO JUST THINKING ABOUT THIS TOGETHER WILL BE REALLY IMPORTANT FOR ANY INCENTIVES- THE LEGISLATURE IS CONSIDERING. SECOND REALLY BRIEFLY IT'S JUST ON HYDROGEN USED IN HOMES I JUST WANT TO NOTE THAT- ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN WOULD REQUIRE THREE TO SIX TIMES MORE RENEWABLE ELECTRICITY'S BEEN HITTING THAT SAME HOME WITH A HIGHLY EFFICIENT HEAT PUMP. IT ALSO REQUIRES YOU GAS PIPELINES TO BE REPLACED WITH UPGRADED PIPES AND APPLIANCES IN THE HOME IT'S NOT A PRACTICAL SOLUTION ABOUT HYDROGEN- HAS BEEN AND PENCIL USES WE SUPPORT IN THE CONTEXT I'D ENCOURAGE THE LEGISLATOR TO FOCUS YOUR TWO G. ON THURSDAY. USE THAT IN A SENSE WAY THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR TIME YOU'RE TO THIS ISSUE THANK YOU WE'RE YOU COMMENTS AND WE ARE NOTE THANK YOU YOUR NEXT OF A LINE OF TWENTY SIX YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. GREAT THANK YOU CHAIRMAN TERRY THIS MY NAME IS JENNIFER HELFRICH AND I'M SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF FURIES WERE IN NONPROFIT. ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION AND WE RUN SOMETHING CALLED THE BUSINESS FOR INNOVATIVE CLIMATE ENERGY POLICY OR BY SEVEN AT WORK THAT THE COALITION OF NEARLY SEVENTY MAJOR COMPANIES MANY OF WHOM HAVE SUBSTANTIAL OPERATION OR HEADQUARTERED IN CALIFORNIA. AND IN THE CONTEXT OF THIS HEARING I WANTED TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION THAT OUR BUSINESS MEMBERS AND PARTNERS HAVE REPEATEDLY CALLED ON CALIFORNIA COULD FEEL AMBITIOUS. BUILDING DECARBONIZATION POLICIES MOST RECENTLY IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND AGAIN IN MAY OF THIS YEAR WE SUBMITTED A LETTER SIGNED BY FIFTY FIVE BUSINESSES AND INSTITUTIONS- AND WE PUT IN THE TITLE TWENTY FOUR DOCUMENT FIFTY FEET. AND WE CAN SHARE IT WITH- YOU ALL AFTER THE HEARING TO THE SIGNATORIES OF THIS LETTER INCLUDED JLL FORTUNE FIVE HUNDRED COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE SERVICES COMPANY. ADOBE DIGNITY HEALTH EBAY PAYPAL I KIA SIERRA NEVADA BREWING UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA ARE YOU TO RECALIBRATE DAVIS VF CORPORATION AND MANY MORE AND I JUST WANT YOU ALL TO KNOW THAT THESE COMPANIES REALLY SUPPORT. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF ROBUST BUILDING DECARBONIZATION POLICIES. I AND- EXPLAIN A LITTLE BIT ABOUT WHY SO- COMPANIES AND INSTITUTIONS THAT WE WORK WITH AND IF WE CAN'T EXCUSE ME I DON'T MEAN TO CUT YOU OFF- BUT I WOULD PREFER IF YOU'RE GOING TO FOCUS IN ON ANY PARTICULAR ELEMENT- THIS IS NOT A PAID ADVERTISEMENT SO IF YOU WANT TO JUST. HAVE A COMMENT YOU HAVE ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS LEFT- RELATIVE TO THE TO THE- PRESENTATIONS TODAY THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED OTHERWISE. WE'LL MOVE ON TO THE NEXT BECAUSE I GUESS I WOULD JUST SAY THAT- RELEVANT I THINK THAT OUR COMPANIES WOULD IT SUPPORT THIS IN THE CD'S KIND OF THINGS AS A BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY. THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA IF WE CAN PURSUE. POLICIES THAT WILL SUPPORT DECRIMINALIZATION IN THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK THEY SEE IT AS- AN- ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY THE TRAIL SPUR INNOVATION AND JOBS AND- HELP. US OUT THERE AND LOOK FORWARD TO SHARING THE LETTER WITH YOU LAW AFTER THE HEARING. THANK YOU SO MUCH X. BAKER THANK YOU NEXT OVER LINE OF TWENTY NINE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD AFTERNOON CHAT HOLDEN AND MEMBERS OF THE UTILITY ENERGY COMMITTEE. I'M SORRY I'M ABILITY NIGHT A DESIGN PROFESSIONAL AND A RESIDENT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IN ORANGE COUNTY. I ALSO SERVE AS THE DIRECTOR OF SUSTAINABILITY AND ADVOCACY PUT YOUR RANGE COUNTY CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS D. A. AT THE LARGEST UP OF THE HAT PROFESSIONALS IN THE NATION THE EIGHT HAD MADE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION AN URGENT PRIORITY AND APPROACH DECARBONISATION EXISTING BUILDING. THROUGH THE READILY AVAILABLE ELECTRIFICATION TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS HE TALKS. I KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THAT RESIDENTS AND TAKING HAVE ALREADY BEGUN ASKING ARCHITECTS THE STRATEGY TO DECARBONISE THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK. FOR EXAMPLE IRVINE BECAME THE FIRST CITY IN ORANGE COUNTY AND ONLY THE THIRD CITY IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA. TO COMMIT. TO CARBON NEUTRALITY BY TWENTY THIRTY. BUT HE THAT HE WHICH HAD ME THE COME TO NEUTRALITY NEEDS GUIDANCE AND STRATEGIES FOR DECARBONISING EXISTING BUILDING CALIFORNIA FIFTIES URGING KERR LEADERSHIP FROM THE STATE ON BASE TO INCENTIVIZE AND STRATEGIZE THE DECARBONISATION OF OUR EXISTING BUILDINGS I HOPE THE PRESENTATION EXPRESS AT THIS HEARING ACTION FROM THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU PAY ATTENTION ANTI Q. THANK YOU NEXT OF A LINE OF TWENTY EIGHT YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. ROSENBERGER HATER I THINK YOU REALLY NEED TO GET FISHING UP FINANCES LIKE WILDLIFE IF YOU YOU HEAR ME. OKAY AND. NEXT THAT WE WILL GO TO A LINE OF EIGHT- SHE DOES ISRAEL GO TO LINE OF TWENTY YEAR LINE OF THE HE GOOD AFTERNOON OF INTO CRUCIAL AREA I'M AND HERKY A RETIRED JOHN AND WEBER CHANGE NOW LOOKING OPEN ON FIVE HUNDRED CAL HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONAL FOCUS ON THE PUBLIC HOW EMERGENCY CUENTA AND RELATED CLIMATE ARE JEFF ABOUT. I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE IN THE WEATHER ARE AT WEST ABOUT YES ON THE TWO PRICE DR FOURTH JEFF DID IF THEY'RE THAT A BASELINE SHE AND IT WAS MENTIONED SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH WHICH IS A LOT OF IT ALONG WITH MARCH PART THREE THAT THAT BATES HE DESCRIBED BASED ON. CALIFORNIA INCOME TAX WE MUCH COMMOTION POSSIBLE ALSO ALONG LINES OF DOCTOR PRESENTATION TODAY I TO COME YOUR ATTENTION TO THE FOOT RECORD ALLEGES THE CASE STRATEGY FOR EQUITABLE GAS WHICH IS FROM THE BUILDING PATIENT CO ON HAS BEEN APPROACH OF HOW HOW SECTOR FOR BY NAME WHAT TWENTY THE GAS TANKERS. THAT LOWER THE SISTER WIVES ACROSS IT WILL LEADING NOBODY AND PARTICULARLY LONG CONNECT SO TAKE A DEEP TO BE THE FIRST TO BE HOLDEN ABOUT FOR THE END CALL OF THE CURRENT CAP INTEREST. THIS APPROACH TO HOLD RECORD BACK USING BECAUSE I WHAT ALL ALLOW TO NORTH COULD AND IN AIR TRUST WITH THE HIGHEST BURDEN FOR DISEASE. AIR POLLUTION AND IT COULD POP BECOME WITH HOLLISTER APPROACH INCLUDING WHETHER IT'S A INFORMATION AND ALREADY A SHORT HEALTH HAZARDS LIKE LATTIMORE I'M SORRY YOUR APPROACH I'M SORRY YOUR YOUR TO MY IS BY PRE YOUR YOUR OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH NEXT TO HER YOUR WATER LINE FORTY YOU KNOW I IS OPEN PLEASE GO SH GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE AND THANK YOU FOR THE TO COMMENT MY IS ANY GRAB AND I WORK THE LOCAL OFFICE OF ARM AND ENDED NON WORKING TOWARD A LOW CARBON FUTURE CALIFORNIANS SPEND ABOUT 90% OF OUR TIME INSIDE BUILDINGS. WITH WELFARE NO BECAUSE THEY HAVE AIR POLLUTION OUTSIDE. TO ENSURE THAT THE ERROR BREEDING INSIDE OUR HOMES AND BUSINESSES IT'S CLEAN AND SAFE. NATURAL GAS AND HYDROGEN COMBUSTION AND IT'S HARMFUL POLLUTANTS LIKE NITROGEN DIOXIDE IN AND AROUND OUR HOME THE ONLY VIABLE PATHWAY Q. SAFE AND HEALTHY BUILDINGS IT BY ELECTRIFIED OUR PLAN IS BOB HYDROGEN MAY PLAY A ROLE IN A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE I DID NOT BELONG ARE BUILDING. EFFICIENT ELECTRIC APPLIANCES AND EQUIPMENT ARE AVAILABLE FOR INSTALLATION TODAY MANY STUDIES SHOW THAT BUILDING ELECTRIFICATION IS THE LEAST COSTLY PATH AFTER GETTING BUILDING POLLUTION. HYDROGEN OF COSTLY AND IT'S FIVE TIMES LESS EFFICIENT IF YOU LOOK HOME COMPARED TO ELECTRIC HEAT PUMP ANY STATE SUPPORT WRITER AND ANOTHER BASED ENERGY STAR STATE SHOULD FOCUS ONLY ON THE HARD TO ELECTRIFY FACTORS LIKE INDUSTRY I DO NOT HAVE THEIR- CARP AND MARKET READY SOLUTIONS AVAILABLE LIKE BUILDING YOU. CALIFORNIA HAS AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS AND NOW IS THE TIME TO ACT. CALIFORNIA BUT COMMIT TO A LONG TERM STRATEGY TO ELECTRIFY EXISTING BUILDING STOCK WE NEED TO CREATE A POLICY THAT INVESTMENT TO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION FROM GAS TO ELECTRIC APPLIANCES ACTUALLY SUPPORTING AND MODERATE INCOME FAMILIES. I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO PRIORITIZE THE ELECTRIFICATION NUMBER BUILDING FACTOR AND MAKE A CLEANER HEALTHIER BUILDINGS FOR ALL. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. THANK YOU NEXT BIGGER AMERICAN FROM LINE TWENTY FOUR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI THIS IS THE SONG WHICH ARE JUSTICE- THANKS SO MUCH CHAIR HOLDEN AND JERRY VOTES FOR SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT COMMITTEE HEARING- I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY THREE POINTS REALLY QUICK SO MY FIRST ONE IS JUST. YOU KNOW FOLLOWING UP ON THANKING YOU FOR HAVING THIS HEARING I ALSO REALLY WANT TO URGE SORT OF A PARADIGM SHIFT IN THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT AND TALK ABOUT THE EXISTING BUILDING THE CAR. FROM A COST TO INVESTMENT- YES UPGRADING ELECTRIFY EXISTING BUILDING STOCK IS EXPENSIVE BUT WE SHOULD FEEL REALLY HELPFUL ABOUT THE INVESTMENT NEEDED IN THIS FRONT HERE EMPLOYING THOUSANDS OF WORKERS IN HIGH ROAD JOBS. DELIVERING COMFORTABLE RESILIENT AND POLLUTION FREE HOMES AND SCHOOLS IS ONE OF THE MOST UPLIFTING ASPECTS OF THE CLEAN ENERGY TRANSITION. AND I THINK THE LEGISLATURE HAS AN ENORMOUS WILL TO PLAYING. COMMUNICATING THAT VISION TO THE PUBLIC AND THEN ALSO THIS INVESTMENT OF COURSE HAS TO START WITH LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. TO MAKE THIS AN OPPORTUNITY DELIVER JUSTICE- ESPECIALLY THE COMMUNITIES WHO ALREADY FACE ENERGY BURDENS AND OCCUPY THE JOB IS THE MOST INEFFICIENT HOMES. SISTER MCALLISTER SAID LIKE THE TRANSITION PORT TO BE EFFECTIVE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON BEING BOTTOM UP AND MY SECOND POINT IS THAT STRATEGIC DECOMMISSIONING OF THE DOCTORS TRADITION SYSTEM AS YOU HEARD IT IS IMPERATIVE IN THE LEAGUE ASML'S COFFEE LINE TO THE GAS SYSTEM CAN BE A TRIPLE WIN FOR CLIMATE RATES AND COMMUNITIES SO THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD REALLY AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE THE STRATEGY IN ADDITION TO LEVERAGING OPPORTUNITIES RIPARIAN COOLING WITH HEATING EYES JERRY BUSES BILL. SET UP TO DO AND FINALLY. I VALUE ALL TO PLEASE BE ON GUARD ABOUT HYDROGEN WE SHOULDN'T BE SPLITTING RESOURCES PUTTING EXPENSIVE GREEN HYDROGEN. IN A SYSTEM THAT WE NEED TO BE DECOMMISSIONING THE SIMPLE FACT OF THE HYDROGEN CAN ONLY BE HANDLED A REALLY SMALL VOLUMES IN THE JOB SYSTEM WHICH HAVE LIMITED CARBON SAVINGS NO AIR POLLUTION BENEFIT. AND ALL THAT STUFF FAR GREATER EXPENSE ELECTRIFICATION SAYS DAVID GREEN HYDROGEN FOR CLEANING SECTORS WE CAN'T ELECTRIFY LIKE SHIPPING AND FERTILISER PRODUCTION. I PROMISE THERE'S NO NEED TO LET IS YOUR TWO HUNDRED AND STATE SCHOOL BOARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH- MODERATOR FROM MODERATOR- I COUNT TWELVE. ARE THERE ADDITIONAL CALLERS ON THE LINE IN A SETTLEMENT HOW MANY WE HAVE SEVEN. IN Q. SEVEN Q. OKAY WELL THEN LET'S MOVE ON TO THE NEXT SPEAKER AND WE'LL SORT OF FREEZE IT AT THE SENATE THANK YOU OVER LINE THIRTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR HOLDEN CARE REVERSE COMMITTEE MEMBERS AND TODAY FOR CENTERS MY NAME IS CHRIS MARTIN RICKETT SUMMER REGISTER ARCHITECT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND PRACTITIONER HERE IN LOS ANGELES I WORK FOR A OFFICE TO FOCUS NOT PORTABLE HOUSING AND- AND WHAT I FAMILY HOUSING. I ALSO SERVE AS THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON THE ENVIRONMENT FOR THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF. THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF ARCHITECTS HERE IN LOS ANGELES THIS YEAR HAS BEEN VERY CHALLENGING WE HAVE TO CONDEMN ACT WE HAD. HEAT WAVES WE'VE HAD FIREWORKS AND I'M HERE TO SPEAK ON BEHALF AND IN SUPPORT OF ELECTRIFYING THE EXISTING BUILDING STOCK AND REYES OUT FOSSIL FUELS MANY OF YOU MAY BE AWARE BUT LOS ANGELES IS SITTING IN ONE OF THE BIGGEST IF NOT THE BIGGEST- WELL IN THE UNITED STATES WILL BECOME OIL WELL WE HAVE. A MASSIVE PRODUCTION WITH- FUEL TERRORIST PLOTS THE POOL OF MANY HEALTH IN OPPOSITION AND COST OF ELECTRIFIED THE BUILDING STOCK BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO FOCUS ON THE HEALTH OF PEOPLE IN SPECIALLY IN THE UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND WHAT IS THE COST DO YOU PUT IN THERE HEALTH NEELAM CANNOT SUPPORT SO IT'S THE STATE'S TO ALSO SUPPORT THAT YOU WITNESS HERE INSTANT LEARNING CALIFORNIA PROBABLY SEE A LOT OF SMOKE COMES IN THE PICTURES OF LAKE TAHOE THIS MORNING SIX RESET WE NEED TO FIGHT AGAINST TRYING CHANGE CONSORTIA COURT THEIR COLLECTIVE IN THE CARBON BUILDING STOCK THANK YOU THANK YOU X. BIGGER THANK YOU MEXICO I KNOW FORTY THREE YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU- SHARON AND ALSO- TERRY THE STRIPPER HAVING CERTAIN- MY NAME'S MCALESTER OKLAHOMA COURT AGREED CURRENT HEALTHCARE CORPORATION A WORLD LEADER IN HEATING VENTILATION AIR CONDITIONING. TO KEEP THE STREAK WHICH SAW THE NEXT TECHNICAL WORK COMMITTED TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY AND THE HARMONIZATION OF OUR EQUIPMENT- AND WE BELIEVE THAT HE BONDS HAVE GREAT PROMISE- FOR MOST SECTORS MOST BUILDING TYPES- WE DO WANT TO KIND OF CARRY OUT RIGHT NOW AT THIS TIME. BUDGET OFFERINGS ARE AVAILABLE FOR ALL CLIMATE ZONES CALIFORNIA OR ALL BUILDINGS INTO THAT AND WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK ON DEVELOPING THIS TECHNOLOGY- AND JUST YOU KNOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SOURCE OF LEGISLATURE AMERICANS ARE VITAMINS TCM ALL- TESTIFY FURTHER- WE ALSO WANT TO ADD THAT CODES AND STANDARDS MATTER. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT WE'RE PUSHING TECHNOLOGY WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT CODES AND STANDARDS KEEP UP AS WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN THE FOOTER INSIDE- YOU WE'VE GONE DEEPER WITH A RECRUITER- GWP REDUCTION BUT WE CANNOT BRING THOSE TO MARKET IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE COLORS ARE NOT UP TO DATE. THE EXTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE TO ELEVATE THIS INDUSTRY MOVING. YOU THANK YOU NEXT WE'LL GO TO LINE OF FORTY FOR YOUR LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS STEVE GOODMAN THE I'M A PRINCIPAL WITHOUT CONSULTING ENGINEERING FIRM IN SAN FRANCISCO NAME GIVEN ABOVE WHAT- SIXTY FIVE YEAR OLD COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA- I'VE PERSONALLY SPENT THE PAST FIVE YEARS IMMERSED IN THE CHALLENGES OF DESIGNING DECARBONIZE. BUILDINGS IN CALIFORNIA- SO I'M A BOOTS ON THE GROUND PRACTITIONER AND I WANT TO ADDRESS SOME THINGS I HEARD TODAY- BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION ALL SAT ON THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR FOR THE- DESIGN PROFESSIONALS PRACTICE CHI DECEIT. TO DECARBONISATION OF THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT THAT'S BEING PUBLISHED BY THE WILLIAM J. WORKING FOUNDATION. AND FUNDED BY GOOGLE MICROSOFT THE AIA CALIFORNIA COUNCIL AND OTHERS. I'M ALSO A MEMBER THE BUILDING DECARBONIZATION TASK FORCE OF THE AMERICAN SOCIETY OF HEATING REFRIGERATION AND AIR CONDITIONINGENGINEERS. WHICH WILL CONVENE IN APRIL OF THIS YEAR TO PROVIDE LEADERSHIP FROM WITHIN THE ENGINEERING COMMUNITY ON HOW TO DECARBONISE THE BUILT ENVIRONMENT SO I TRY TO DO THIS NOT ONLY AS A CALIFORNIA PRACTITIONER BY TALK TO PEOPLE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY. ABOUT THIS PROBLEM. AND CHALLENGE- I CAN SEE THAT 70% OF MY FRM'S CURRENT PROJECTS ARE ALL ELECTRIC BUILDINGS- AND WE DO ALL DIFFERENT BUILDING TYPES STUDENT HOUSING AFFORDABLE HOUSING MARKET RATE MULTI FAMILY HOUSING COLLAPSE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. THERE IS NO TECHNICAL LIMITATION TO WHAT HOW WE ELECTRIFIED BUILDINGS. EXISTING BUILDINGS MARCH TO A DIFFERENT DRUMMER- WHILE MY FIRM DOES ADAPTIVE REUSE OF EXISTING BUILDINGS AND WE DO SORT OF WHOLESALE GOT IT REPLACED. OF INFRASTRUCTURE EXISTING BUILDINGS I CAN TELL YOU NOT A SINGLE ONE OF OUR CURRENT PROJECTS. IT'S AN EXISTING BUILDING UPGRADE. CONVERTING FROM GAS TO ELECTRIC SYSTEMS. SO IN ORDER TO CONVERT ENOUGH EXISTING BUILDINGS FAST ENOUGH WE REQUIRE REGULATORY INTERVENTION. PROMULGATING THE CARBONIZATION REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING BUILDINGS- THERE WAS A QUESTION ASKED ABOUT AFFORDABLE HOUSING- ANIMAL I CAN'T SPEAK.

B. THIRTY TWO THIRTY THREE POINT I'M SORRY OUT THAT EVEN IF ARE IN MY ACCOUNT THE CONCEPT IS ME YOU YOU'VE REACHED FOR TWO MINUTES SO I I'M APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING TO CUT YOU OFF BUT WE'RE TRYING TO KEEP EVERYONE GOALIE TO THE MINUTES BUT WE DO TAKE YOUR COMMENTS IN THE ISSUE ABOUT THE AFFORDABILITY ACCESSIBILITY THOSE CERTAINLY BEEN A THEME THROUGH OF THE PUBLIC COMMENTS SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS- MODERATOR THAT'S RIGHT WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU AT THIS TIME MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR ASSISTANCE IN THAT- AND I ALSO WANTED TO THANK ALL OF THOSE WHO CALLED IN TO SHARE THEIR PUBLIC COMMENT I THINK IT'S VERY INSTRUCTIVE IN PUBLIC HEARINGS LIKE THIS. INFORMATIONAL HEARINGS TO HAVE INPUT FROM THE PUBLIC AND I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT WE HAD THE KIND OF ROBUST INTEREST IN THIS TOPIC THAT DREW SO MANY. WHO HAVE SUCH VALUE COMMENTS AND THOUGHTS AND CERTAINLY CONCERNS ABOUT HOW WE DECARBONISE ON OUR EXISTING BUILDING STRUCTURE INSTANCE STATURE. AND INFRASTRUCTURE SHE SAID. BOB LET ME JUST THANK OUR PANELISTS- POPPING BACK UP I WAS GOING TO. BE MISSED FRIEDMAN YOU I GET THE PRICE FOR HANGING IN THE LOGS BUT IT LOOKS LIKE WE HAVE A GOOD NUMBER OF OUR PALACE THAT ARE STILL PRESENT AND I DO APPRECIATE. FOR PERSONAL YOUR- YOUR INSIGHT AND PERSPECTIVE YOU'RE LEARNING THOUGHTS AROUND THE SUBJECT- THE CONTRIBUTION TO THIS ISSUE IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED AND IT'S GOING TO BE ON GOING. AND I THINK THAT ALL OF YOUR COMMENTS REFLECTED THE CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE IN FRONT OF US. THE TECHNOLOGY THAT NEEDS TO KIND OF GET- INTEGRATED INTO OF PLANNING AND TRANSITIONING AND DECARBONISING OUR EXISTING BUILDING STOCK STOCK. AND I JUST- A VERY GRATEFUL THAT ALL OF YOU HAVE- TAKEN THE TIME TO BE A PART OF THIS PRESENTATION TODAY AND AS YOU CAN HEAR FROM THE- PEOPLE WHO CALL CALLED IN. A AFFORDABILITY AND- ACCESSIBILITY ARE TWO VERY IMPORTANT. ISSUES THAT ARE OUT THERE AND AS WE MOVE FORWARD JUST ON ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF DECARBONISATION AND MAKING THE EFFECTIVE TRANSITION IT'S GOING TO BE. A COST IS GOING TO BE VERY MUCH A PART OF- THE INGREDIENTS SO I. I THANK ALL OF YOU- COMMISSIONER MCALLISTER A THANK YOU FOR. THE THE TIME YOU SHARED WITH DR QUIRK AND HIS A QUESTIONS AND I THINK THERE WAS MAYBE. A POINT OR TWO THAT NEEDED TO BE FINALIZED BUT IF I CAN ASK YOU TO- CHECK IN WITH HIM- I. THINK HE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND IF YOU COULD YES IN THE CONTINUE YOUR KERR SO I DON'T THINK- WE HAVE TIME FOR ANY CLOSING COMMENTS UNLESS THERE'S SOMETHING PRESSING BASED ON WHAT YOU HEARD ANYONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE. TO TAKE A MOMENT TO JUST. GIVE A ONE MINUTE- CLOTHES NOT REQUIRED BUT- IF THERE'S SOMETHING THAT YOU FIND. BASED ON WHAT YOU HEARD OR SOMETHING THAT YOU FELT NEEDS TO GET OUT THERE ON THE RECORD TODAY. FEEL FREE TO- TO MAKE OUT A LAST MINUTE CLOSE CHAIR I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE OF VERY BRIEF POINTS WE HAVE A GREAT PLATFORM TO PROCEED FORWARD ON WE HAVE AN INCREDIBLE COMMUNITY OF THE KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE WE ARE MANY OF THEM IN THE COMMENTS SECTION WE HAVE SEVERAL ON THIS PANEL- AND- THINGS LIKE THAT- PROJECTS AT AT A- SMALL TO MEDIUM SCALE THEY'RE ALREADY OUT THERE. IS A REALLY GOOD BUILDING RETROFIT PROGRAM IN THE DISTANT PAST MUSIC AND THE COACHELLA VALLEY- THAT THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT SOUTH COAST IS FUNDING- THAT IS REALLY SHOWING GREAT SUCCESS FOR EXAMPLE THAT IS A PLATFORM FOR SCALE. WE HAVE A BENCHMARKING PROGRAM THAT COVERS OUR MULTI FAMILY HOMES AND ARE NOT RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS ABOUT THREE THOUSAND SQUARE FEET. WE HAVE A LOT OF INFORMATION AND WE CAN TAKE THAT TO THE NEXT STEP- THE NEXT STAGE BUT WITH SOME BUILDING PERFORMANCE STANDARDS PERHAPS BUT CERTAINLY- TARGETING PROGRAMS TO THE BUILDINGS THAT THE BENCHMARKING PROGRAM IS SHOWING. ARE THE LEAST EFFICIENT. AND SO WE HAVE A LOT OF TOOLS JUST TO GET THOSE TWO EXAMPLES AT OUR DISPOSAL TO TARGET OUR EXISTING BUILDINGS AND IT REPLICATE THE SUCCESS SO IT IS GOING TO TAKE RESOURCES IT IS GONNA TAKE PLANNING AND CONCERTED EFFORT. BUT WE ARE A STATE THAT KNOWS HOW TO DO THIS AND SO WE HAVE A TRACK RECORD. OF BEING ABLE TO MOVE THE NEEDLE ON MARKETS AND ONCE WE DO THAT WE GET A CONSISTENT LONG TERM VIEW OF WHAT OUR POLICY IS GOING TO BE THE MARKETPLACE DOES PICK IT UP AND RUN WITH IT. WE'VE SEEN THAT TIME AND TIME AGAIN IT DOES TAKE THAT CONCERTED MESSAGING AND AN INTENTION PROJECTING FORWARD FOR A DECADE OR MORE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND THE REST OF THE OF THE LEGISLATURE- ON ADVANCING THESE IDEAS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR. LEADERSHIP. I THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP SIERRA LET'S LET'S DISCUSS GREAT MALES MATH AYE JUST WANTED TO ECHO COMMISSIONER MCALLISTER ON ON PLANNING AND BUSINESS CERTAINTY AND CONSISTENCY FOR MANUFACTURERS. THAT'S ABSOLUTELY IMPORTANT- CERTAINLY ON BEHALF OF A. O. SMITH- WERE READY TO- AND BRACES STEP UP TO THE CHALLENGE AND ARE WORKING WITH OUR- OUR FRIENDS AND OUR FRIENDS. AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND AMONGST OTHERS- BUT BUSINESS CERTAINTY IS KEY FOR US SO THAT WE CAN MAKE SURE THAT OUR PRODUCT ENGINEERING AND ROAD MAPPING- FITS THE MARKET- BECAUSE AT THE END OF THE DAY WE DO SELL TO CUSTOMERS AND- WE NEED THAT DEMANDED. OF CERTAINTY IN THE REGULATORY SPACE AND THANKS AGAIN FOR. HAVING US AS A PART OF THIS HEARING. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT. AND IT YES PLEASE. IF IT'S ALL RIGHT- GERALD I'D SAY JUST SAY ONE QUICK THING- I WAS REALLY STRUCK IN THE COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS THAT YOU'RE RIVAS ASKED. ABOUT EXTREME HEAT EVENTS- IT'S IMPORTANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT WHEN- A HOMEOWNER IS CONSIDERING. GETTING AIR CONDITIONING GET A HEAT PUMP IS A NO BRAINER TO KEEP DOES TYPICALLY WILL GO AND CALL HOME. AND IN ADDITION TO THE EXTREME HEAT CONCERNS THAT YOU'RE RIVAS EXPRESSED I THINK IT'S ALSO REALLY IMPORTANT EMPHASIZED THAT. MOVING IN THIS DIRECTION MIGHT ALSO ALLOW FOR A HOME TO HAVE MUCH IMPROVED AIR QUALITY THAT ARE PROTECTED RESIDENTS FROM SMOKE IMPACTS AND THAT'S BECOMING INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE TO BE ADDRESSED IN CALIFORNIA. WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO BUILD TIGHTER HOMES THAT WILL BE ENERGY EFFICIENT. AS WE DO AS WE SHUT THE WINDOWS ON A HOT SUMMER DAY WHEN YOU'RE SMOKING OUTSIDE WE'RE GONNA NEED AIR CONDITIONING. AND DOT SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL WITH A HIGH QUALITY AIR FILTERS TO REALLY PROTECT ITS RESIDENTS ESPECIALLY KIDS RIGHT AND WOMEN. AND SENIOR CITIZENS FROM THE IMPACTS OF SMOKE THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR PUTTING A FINE POINT ON THAT- TOPIC BROUGHT UP BY. THE CHAIR- I WANT TO JUST THINK AGAIN ALL OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND BEFORE AND THAT CONCLUDES OUR AGENDA SO- AS WE MOVE FOR A TOWARDS THE JOURNEY I JUST WANTED TO TAKE A MOMENT.

SHE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR PUTTING ON THIS HEARING ORGANIZING THAT ANY TOUCHING BASES WITH ALL OF YOUR OFFICES AND SO I JUST WANTED TO RECOGNIZE HER- THIS IS- HER LAST HEARING AS A SCIENCE FELLOW. WE KNOW THIS IS GOING TO BE- AN INCREDIBLE LEADER IN THIS SPACE- IN OR OUTSIDE OF THIS BUILDING AND WE LOOK FORWARD AND OR OR- PRIVILEGED TO HAVE A PROGRAM THAT BRINGS US SUCH. TALENTED PEOPLE TO BECOME PART OF THE SCIENCE OF ENERGY AND UTILITY ON THE MARKET PLACE AND SO WE JUST WANT TO GIVE HER- CONGRADULATIONS WERE GREAT YEAR. SHE HAD- COVERT AS OUR FIRST YEAR AND SO THAT WAS NOT FUN DIDN'T GET A CHANCE TO. INTERACT QUITE AS MUCH BUT- SHE'S JUST BEEN.
