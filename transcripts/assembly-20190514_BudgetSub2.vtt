00:41:44.301 --> 00:41:45.202
NECESSARY [inaudible]

00:41:45.269 --> 00:41:47.338
THANK YOU.

00:41:47.404 --> 00:41:47.571
HELLO.

00:41:47.638 --> 00:41:48.906
THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING

00:41:48.973 --> 00:41:49.506
MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAN A

00:41:49.573 --> 00:41:50.941
COUPON WITH THE LEGISLATIVE

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.109
ANALYST'S OFFICE I'LL BE

00:41:52.176 --> 00:41:53.043
SPEAKING FROM A HANDOUT THAT THE

00:41:53.110 --> 00:41:54.478
SERGEANT JUST DISTRIBUTED.

00:41:54.545 --> 00:41:55.880
I THINK THE ADMINISTRATION GIVE

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:56.513
YOU A GOOD OVERVIEW OF THIS MAY

00:41:56.580 --> 00:41:57.481
REVISION.

00:41:57.548 --> 00:41:58.115
THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT THERE

00:41:58.182 --> 00:41:59.617
ARE REALLY. THREE NUMBERS TO

00:41:59.683 --> 00:42:01.018
FOCUS ON THAT KIND OF TELL THE

00:42:01.085 --> 00:42:03.654
TALE OF WHAT'S IN THIS YEAR IS A

00:42:03.721 --> 00:42:04.822
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PACKAGE.

00:42:04.889 --> 00:42:06.557
ARE THE FIRST TO SEVEN HUNDRED

00:42:06.624 --> 00:42:08.125
AND FORTY SIX MILLION THAT'S THE

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.860
INCREASE IN PROPOSITION NINETY

00:42:09.927 --> 00:42:11.095
EIGHT ACROSS THE ENTIRE BUDGET

00:42:11.161 --> 00:42:13.931
PERIOD SO.

00:42:13.998 --> 00:42:14.531
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN TO NINETEEN

00:42:14.598 --> 00:42:15.366
TWENTY I THAT INCREASES MAINLY A

00:42:15.432 --> 00:42:16.667
FUNCTION OF THE ADDITIONAL

00:42:16.734 --> 00:42:18.535
GENERAL FUND REVENUE.

00:42:18.602 --> 00:42:19.570
I THINK MOST OF YOU ARE AWARE WE

00:42:19.637 --> 00:42:20.671
HAD A GOOD REVENUE MONTH IN

00:42:20.738 --> 00:42:22.673
APRIL AND REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE

00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:23.807
UP I'M A BIT Và COMPARED TO

00:42:23.874 --> 00:42:26.644
WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WAS

00:42:26.710 --> 00:42:30.681
IN JANUARY -- TURNING-- TO PAGE

00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:31.982
TWO OF OUR HAND OUT.

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:32.950
I THINK THE NEXT IMPORTANT

00:42:33.017 --> 00:42:34.652
NUMBER IS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:35.753
NINE MILLION THAT'S THE AMOUNT

00:42:35.819 --> 00:42:37.855
OF THE STATE'S FIRST DEPOSIT

00:42:37.922 --> 00:42:40.057
INTO THE STATE SCHOOL RESERVE.

00:42:40.124 --> 00:42:41.425
A LOT OF FORMULAS.

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:42.826
KIND OF UNDER PEN THAT RESERVE

00:42:42.893 --> 00:42:46.397
ACCOUNT BUT THE IDEA IS -- TO

00:42:46.463 --> 00:42:47.531
THE FORMALIST TRY TO RECOGNIZE

00:42:47.598 --> 00:42:49.066
HERE IS WHEN THE GUARANTEE IS

00:42:49.133 --> 00:42:50.834
GOING OUT OF AN ABOVE AVERAGE

00:42:50.901 --> 00:42:52.503
PACE AND SET ASIDE SOME OF THAT

00:42:52.569 --> 00:42:54.772
FUNDING FOR TIGHTER FISCAL TIMES.

00:42:54.838 --> 00:42:56.040
A DEPOSIT THE REQUIRED

00:42:56.106 --> 00:42:57.641
SPECIFICALLY WHEN THE STATE

00:42:57.708 --> 00:43:00.277
RECEIVES CAPITAL GAINS ABOVE

00:43:00.344 --> 00:43:01.612
HAVE ITS LONG TERM AVERAGE.

00:43:01.679 --> 00:43:03.547
AND WHEN THE MINIMUM GUARANTEED

00:43:03.614 --> 00:43:05.115
IS ABOVE THE PRIOR YEAR FUNDING

00:43:05.182 --> 00:43:07.217
LEVEL ADJUSTED FOR CHANGES IN

00:43:07.284 --> 00:43:10.587
STUDENT ATTENDANCE AND INFLATION

00:43:10.654 --> 00:43:11.522
FACTOR.

00:43:11.588 --> 00:43:12.156
AND THEN THE FINAL NUMBER THAT

00:43:12.222 --> 00:43:13.590
WE THINK IS IMPORTANT IS A

00:43:13.657 --> 00:43:14.525
HUNDRED IN NINETEEN MILLION

00:43:14.591 --> 00:43:15.759
THAT'S THE AMOUNT OF THE

00:43:15.826 --> 00:43:17.661
ADDITIONAL FUNDING. FOR THE

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:18.729
GOVERNOR SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:43:18.796 --> 00:43:20.731
PROPOSAL IN JANUARY THAT

00:43:20.798 --> 00:43:22.800
PROPOSAL WAS A COMBINATION OF

00:43:22.866 --> 00:43:25.502
ONE TIME AND I'M GOING SOURCES --

00:43:25.569 --> 00:43:27.871
A REVISION UPS THAT. TO NEARLY

00:43:27.938 --> 00:43:29.807
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION AND MAKES

00:43:29.873 --> 00:43:31.642
ALL THE FUNDING I'M GOING --

00:43:31.709 --> 00:43:32.776
BEYOND THE SCHOOL RESERVE

00:43:32.843 --> 00:43:35.045
DEPOSIT AND TO THE ADDITIONAL

00:43:35.112 --> 00:43:36.447
FUNDING FOR SPECIAL EDUCATION.

00:43:36.513 --> 00:43:37.948
REALLY ALL OF THE REST OF THE

00:43:38.015 --> 00:43:39.249
NEW FUNDING IN THIS PACKAGE IS

00:43:39.316 --> 00:43:40.617
ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:42.686
CHANGES SO COVERING SLIGHTLY

00:43:42.753 --> 00:43:43.187
HIGHER COSTS OF STUDENT

00:43:43.253 --> 00:43:44.388
ATTENDANCE.

00:43:44.455 --> 00:43:47.124
A FEW ITEMS NEW CUSTOMERS SINCE

00:43:47.191 --> 00:43:47.858
JANUARY.

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.026
BEYOND THAT THERE'S REALLY NOT A

00:43:49.093 --> 00:43:50.861
WHOLE LOT OF NEW FUNDING INSIDE

00:43:50.928 --> 00:43:53.564
OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

00:43:53.630 --> 00:43:55.766
PART OF THIS YEAR'S BUDGET.

00:43:55.833 --> 00:43:57.468
I TURNING TO PAGE THREE THIS IS

00:43:57.534 --> 00:43:58.936
REALLY JUST MORE OF A TECHNICAL.

00:43:59.003 --> 00:44:00.237
SUMMARY OF ALL OF THE SPECIFIC

00:44:00.304 --> 00:44:01.805
SPENDING CHANGES TO GET INTO ALL

00:44:01.872 --> 00:44:03.741
OF THOSE IN A SUBSEQUENT HEARING

00:44:03.807 --> 00:44:06.477
SOMEWHAT SPEND ANY TIME ON ON

00:44:06.543 --> 00:44:08.545
THOSE THAT TABLE NOW.

00:44:08.612 --> 00:44:09.480
I TURNING TO PAGE.

00:44:09.546 --> 00:44:11.048
FOUR WE THINK THIS PROVISION

00:44:11.115 --> 00:44:12.383
THIS BEING THE VISION HAS

00:44:12.449 --> 00:44:14.852
SEVERAL POSITIVE ELEMENTS. ONE

00:44:14.918 --> 00:44:17.021
OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS -- I

00:44:17.087 --> 00:44:18.122
ALWAYS WE LOOK AT IS BY THE

00:44:18.188 --> 00:44:19.256
ESTIMATES OF THE MINIMUM

00:44:19.323 --> 00:44:20.290
GUARANTEE REASONABLE BECAUSE

00:44:20.357 --> 00:44:22.292
THAT SET THE TABLE FOR ALL OF

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.460
THE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT WHAT THE

00:44:23.527 --> 00:44:26.697
STATE -- MARK CAN AND WANTS TO

00:44:26.764 --> 00:44:27.231
PROVIDE FOR SCHOOLS IN THE

00:44:27.297 --> 00:44:28.098
COMING YEAR.

00:44:28.165 --> 00:44:29.733
THE ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES

00:44:29.800 --> 00:44:31.235
OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE I

00:44:31.301 --> 00:44:32.870
SLIGHTLY BELOW OURS WE THINK

00:44:32.936 --> 00:44:34.905
THAT'S LARGELY BECAUSE WE HAD

00:44:34.972 --> 00:44:36.940
I'M A LITTLE BIT -- MORE RECENT

00:44:37.007 --> 00:44:37.741
DATA WHEN WE PREPARED OUR

00:44:37.808 --> 00:44:39.676
ESTIMATES WE ALSO HAVE A LITTLE

00:44:39.743 --> 00:44:41.512
BIT OF A DIFFERENT WAY OF

00:44:41.578 --> 00:44:43.247
MODELING THE EFFECTS OF INITIAL

00:44:43.313 --> 00:44:45.516
PUBLIC OFFERINGS OF COMPANIES

00:44:45.582 --> 00:44:47.084
THAT ARE BASED IN CALIFORNIA.

00:44:47.151 --> 00:44:47.851
IT'S BEEN KIND OF A BIG TOPIC

00:44:47.918 --> 00:44:50.821
THE LAST FEW WEEKS AND MONTHS --

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:53.257
SO ACROSS THE SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

00:44:53.323 --> 00:44:53.824
TO NINETEEN TWENTY PERIOD I

00:44:53.891 --> 00:44:55.025
REVENUE ESTIMATES A LITTLE BIT

00:44:55.092 --> 00:44:56.427
HIGHER -- BUT OUR ESTIMATES OF

00:44:56.493 --> 00:44:58.228
THE GUARANTEE I REALLY ONLY A

00:44:58.295 --> 00:44:59.563
TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION

00:44:59.630 --> 00:45:01.231
ABOVE THE ADMINISTRATION OVER

00:45:01.298 --> 00:45:02.699
THAT ENTIRE THREE YEAR PERIOD

00:45:02.766 --> 00:45:04.301
THAT'S ONE OF THE CLOSEST.

00:45:04.368 --> 00:45:06.070
THE CLOSEST I THINK WE'VE BEEN.

00:45:06.136 --> 00:45:07.538
IN MANY YEARS AS FAR AS OUR

00:45:07.604 --> 00:45:09.440
ESTIMATES OF THE GUARANTEE SO WE

00:45:09.506 --> 00:45:10.941
THINK THAT BUT THE MAYOR VISION

00:45:11.008 --> 00:45:14.378
IS A REASONABLE STARTING POINT

00:45:14.445 --> 00:45:16.680
FOR YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS --

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:17.848
THE DEPOSIT INTO THE STATE

00:45:17.915 --> 00:45:18.916
SCHOOL RESERVE IS A SIGNIFICANT

00:45:18.982 --> 00:45:20.284
DEVELOPMENT LOTS OF COMPLEX

00:45:20.350 --> 00:45:22.486
CALCULATIONS -- UNDERMINE THAT

00:45:22.553 --> 00:45:23.487
WE'VE REVIEWED -- BUT THE

00:45:23.554 --> 00:45:25.789
ADMINISTRATION ESTIMATES THAT

00:45:25.856 --> 00:45:26.990
DEPOSIT YOU THINK THEY'D WITH WE

00:45:27.057 --> 00:45:28.125
THINK THEY ADMINISTER THE

00:45:28.192 --> 00:45:29.193
FORMULAS ACCURATELY AND

00:45:29.259 --> 00:45:31.695
CONSISTENT WITH THE INTENT TO

00:45:31.762 --> 00:45:32.863
PROPOSITION.

00:45:32.930 --> 00:45:33.697
TWO AND IT'S WE THINK IT'S

00:45:33.764 --> 00:45:34.765
SIGNIFICANT THAT FOR THE FIRST

00:45:34.832 --> 00:45:36.567
TIME STATE REALLY HAS A

00:45:36.633 --> 00:45:38.402
DEDICATED SOURCE OF FUNDING --

00:45:38.469 --> 00:45:41.071
SET ASIDE NOW SPECIFICALLY TO

00:45:41.138 --> 00:45:42.773
SUPPLEMENT THE MINIMUM

00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:44.108
GUARANTEED DURING TIED TO IT

00:45:44.174 --> 00:45:45.542
ECONOMIC TIMES YES I THINK THAT

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:46.743
COMPLEMENT SOME OF THE THINGS

00:45:46.810 --> 00:45:47.945
YOU'VE DONE ELSEWHERE IN YOUR

00:45:48.011 --> 00:45:51.515
BUDGET TO TRY. TO MOVE THE STATE

00:45:51.582 --> 00:45:54.651
AND EVEN FOR MY FISCAL FOOTING --

00:45:54.718 --> 00:45:55.486
THE MAYOR VISION ALSO REVISITS

00:45:55.552 --> 00:45:56.854
THE MIX OF ONE TIME AND I'M

00:45:56.920 --> 00:46:00.457
GOING PRO PROPOSALS AND THAT'S

00:46:00.524 --> 00:46:01.859
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THAT MIX

00:46:01.925 --> 00:46:03.160
REALLY DETERMINES WHETHER YOU

00:46:03.227 --> 00:46:03.961
HAVE.

00:46:04.027 --> 00:46:05.963
REALLY A STRUCTURAL DEFICIT OR

00:46:06.029 --> 00:46:07.965
SURPLUS GOING INTO.

00:46:08.031 --> 00:46:09.099
YOUR BUDGET DELIBERATIONS IN

00:46:09.166 --> 00:46:11.335
SUBSEQUENT YEARS.

00:46:11.401 --> 00:46:11.935
AND IN THIS AREA WE THINK THE

00:46:12.002 --> 00:46:13.170
MAYOR VISION IS A REALLY MOVING

00:46:13.237 --> 00:46:14.438
IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

00:46:14.505 --> 00:46:15.639
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAD

00:46:15.706 --> 00:46:17.508
PROPOSED SPENDING ABOUT EIGHTY

00:46:17.574 --> 00:46:18.809
MILLION MORE ON ON GOING

00:46:18.876 --> 00:46:21.245
PROGRAMS THAN IT HAD AVAILABLE

00:46:21.311 --> 00:46:22.446
ON GOING WE SOURCES SO A LITTLE

00:46:22.513 --> 00:46:24.014
BIT OF A DEFICIT.

00:46:24.081 --> 00:46:25.582
OVER THE LONG RUN OTHER NAY

00:46:25.649 --> 00:46:27.284
REVISION ELIMINATES THAT AND IN

00:46:27.351 --> 00:46:29.253
FACT IT SPENDS IT BUILDS IN A

00:46:29.319 --> 00:46:30.954
SMALL SURPLUS OF ONE HUNDRED AND

00:46:31.021 --> 00:46:31.722
FIFTY MILLION.

00:46:31.788 --> 00:46:37.227
I HEADING INTO.

00:46:37.294 --> 00:46:37.794
TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND

00:46:37.861 --> 00:46:38.462
THEN FINALLY ON THE PROGRAMMATIC

00:46:38.529 --> 00:46:39.496
SIDE WE THINK THE CHANGES TO THE

00:46:39.563 --> 00:46:40.430
KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANT

00:46:40.497 --> 00:46:42.432
PROGRAM ARE ANOTHER POSITIVE

00:46:42.499 --> 00:46:42.633
STEP.

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:44.468
OUT OUR ANALYSIS AND FOUND THAT

00:46:44.535 --> 00:46:45.769
IT UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM A

00:46:45.836 --> 00:46:47.171
LOT OF THOSE FUNDS ARE GOING TO

00:46:47.237 --> 00:46:48.839
DISTRICTS THAT ALREADY RUN FULL

00:46:48.906 --> 00:46:50.374
DAY KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS.

00:46:50.440 --> 00:46:51.475
AT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL I

00:46:51.542 --> 00:46:52.576
THINK WOULD TRY TO GET THE

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.845
PROGRAM MORE TOWARD YOUR CORE

00:46:54.912 --> 00:46:55.812
INTEREST WHICH WAS INCURRING

00:46:55.879 --> 00:46:58.582
TRAJAN DISTRICTS TO CONVERT FROM.

00:46:58.649 --> 00:47:00.784
A PARTY TO FULL DAY PROGRAMS.

00:47:00.851 --> 00:47:01.652
WE THINK THAT THE MAN FOR THE

00:47:01.718 --> 00:47:02.986
PROGRAM IS STILL LIKELY TO BE

00:47:03.053 --> 00:47:04.688
LESS THAN SIX HUNDRED MILLION SO

00:47:04.755 --> 00:47:06.089
IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR WAYS TO

00:47:06.156 --> 00:47:07.124
FREE UP FUNDING FOR YOUR OTHER

00:47:07.191 --> 00:47:08.992
PRIORITIES YOU COULD CONSIDER

00:47:09.059 --> 00:47:12.963
FUNDING A SMALLER AMOUNT. FOR

00:47:13.030 --> 00:47:15.165
THAT GRANT PROGRAM.

00:47:15.232 --> 00:47:17.100
I FINALLY TURNING TO PAGE FIVE A

00:47:17.167 --> 00:47:17.734
HIGHLIGHT I JUST TOOK CONCERNS

00:47:17.801 --> 00:47:18.368
WE THINK YOU SHOULD BE THINKING

00:47:18.435 --> 00:47:18.602
ABOUT.

00:47:18.669 --> 00:47:20.204
A ONE IS THAT EVEN THOUGH THE

00:47:20.270 --> 00:47:21.371
MAYOR VISION DOES HAVE THIS

00:47:21.438 --> 00:47:22.940
SMALL ONE TIME CUSHION OF ABOUT

00:47:23.006 --> 00:47:24.675
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION.

00:47:24.741 --> 00:47:25.776
THAT'S STILL VERY MODEST IN THE

00:47:25.842 --> 00:47:27.578
CONTEXT OF WHAT YOU'VE DONE

00:47:27.644 --> 00:47:29.213
PREVIOUSLY AND WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN

00:47:29.279 --> 00:47:30.714
IN A RECESSION.

00:47:30.781 --> 00:47:31.815
OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS YOU'VE

00:47:31.882 --> 00:47:33.850
SET ASIDE AN AVERAGE OF ABOUT

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.185
SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR FOR

00:47:35.252 --> 00:47:36.653
ONGOING.

00:47:36.720 --> 00:47:38.622
ACTIVITIES SO -- AN APPRECIABLE

00:47:38.689 --> 00:47:39.756
QUESTION IF THE MINIMUM

00:47:39.823 --> 00:47:40.924
GUARANTEED DROPS.

00:47:40.991 --> 00:47:42.292
A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION IT

00:47:42.359 --> 00:47:43.493
IS SOMETHING THAT COULD VANISH

00:47:43.560 --> 00:47:44.761
VERY QUICKLY IF THE MINIMUM

00:47:44.828 --> 00:47:46.163
GUARANTEE SLOW AS WE HAVE AN

00:47:46.230 --> 00:47:47.497
ECONOMIC DOWNTURN.

00:47:47.564 --> 00:47:48.966
AND SO WE THINK AS YOU REVIEW

00:47:49.032 --> 00:47:50.334
SOME OF THE SPECIFICS BUT

00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:51.635
SPENDING PROPOSALS.

00:47:51.702 --> 00:47:53.270
WHEN I THINK ABOUT -- SHIFTING A

00:47:53.337 --> 00:47:54.771
LITTLE BIT MORE TOWARDS A ONE

00:47:54.838 --> 00:47:56.139
TIME ACTIVITIES AND NOT QUITE AS

00:47:56.206 --> 00:48:00.644
MUCH ON GOING SPENDING AS THE

00:48:00.711 --> 00:48:02.079
GOVERNOR PROPOSES.

00:48:02.145 --> 00:48:04.047
IN TERMS OF SPEND SPECIFIC

00:48:04.114 --> 00:48:04.648
SPENDING PROPOSALS -- WE DO IT

00:48:04.715 --> 00:48:05.249
CAN I CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME

00:48:05.315 --> 00:48:07.217
CONCERNS WITH THE SPECIAL

00:48:07.284 --> 00:48:11.622
EDUCATION GRANT PROPOSAL -- ON

00:48:11.688 --> 00:48:14.358
THIS -- ONE THE CONCERN IS THAT

00:48:14.424 --> 00:48:15.959
THE FUNDING IS ALLOCATED

00:48:16.026 --> 00:48:17.261
ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER ONE OF

00:48:17.327 --> 00:48:18.829
THE FACTORS IN THE PROGRAM IS

00:48:18.895 --> 00:48:19.930
THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO RIDE

00:48:19.997 --> 00:48:22.165
IDENTIFIED WITH A DISABILITY.

00:48:22.232 --> 00:48:24.101
AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT CREATES

00:48:24.167 --> 00:48:25.769
A POOR INCENTIVES BECAUSE

00:48:25.836 --> 00:48:27.404
DISTRICTS THAT ARE SUCCESSFUL IN

00:48:27.471 --> 00:48:29.306
REDUCING THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS

00:48:29.373 --> 00:48:30.540
WITH DISABILITIES.

00:48:30.607 --> 00:48:31.608
WITH EITHER FUNDING DROP UNDER

00:48:31.675 --> 00:48:34.044
THIS PROGRAM AND DISTRICTS THAT

00:48:34.111 --> 00:48:35.812
SORT OF MAINTAIN IDENTIFICATION

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:38.248
RATES -- THEY ACTUALLY CONTINUE

00:48:38.315 --> 00:48:39.950
TO SEE IF THE SAME OR EVEN MORE

00:48:40.017 --> 00:48:41.151
FUNDING.

00:48:41.218 --> 00:48:42.786
AND IT'S NOT JUST POCKET CHANGE --

00:48:42.853 --> 00:48:44.187
THE AMOUNT FOR DISTRICTS THAT

00:48:44.254 --> 00:48:46.857
QUALIFY FOR THIS PROGRAM KIND OF

00:48:46.923 --> 00:48:48.425
ON THE MARGIN EACH ADDITIONAL

00:48:48.492 --> 00:48:49.760
STUDENT THE IDENTIFIER DON'T

00:48:49.826 --> 00:48:52.162
IDENTIFY IS WORTH MORE THAN TEN

00:48:52.229 --> 00:48:53.830
THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT SO

00:48:53.897 --> 00:48:55.499
IT'S A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT --

00:48:55.565 --> 00:48:59.703
FISCAL COMMON SENATE FOR SOME OF

00:48:59.770 --> 00:49:02.072
THESE DISTRICTS -- WHAT WE'VE WE

00:49:02.139 --> 00:49:03.106
THINK YOU'VE GOT SOME OTHER

00:49:03.173 --> 00:49:03.774
OPTIONS THAT MIGHT HAVE BETTER

00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:04.508
ADDRESSED SOME OF YOUR LONG

00:49:04.574 --> 00:49:05.509
STANDING CONCERNS WITH SPECIAL

00:49:05.575 --> 00:49:07.511
EDUCATION -- ONE WOULD BE TO

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:09.379
FOCUS ON FINDING IT EQUALIZATION

00:49:09.446 --> 00:49:10.547
WE THINK THAT WOULD DISTRIBUTE

00:49:10.614 --> 00:49:12.649
FUNDING BOTH MORE BROADLY AND IT

00:49:12.716 --> 00:49:14.284
WOULD ALSO REDUCE THE STRUGGLE

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:15.652
FUNDING INEQUITIES WITHOUT

00:49:15.719 --> 00:49:17.454
CREATING ANY OF THESE.

00:49:17.521 --> 00:49:19.323
KINDS OF INCENTIVE CONCERNS.

00:49:19.389 --> 00:49:20.624

SOMETHING THAT DISTRICTS ARE

00:49:26.396 --> 00:49:28.498
REQUIRED TO DO BUT THERE IS NO

CALL IS BEING DECREASED.

00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:43.266
FROM THREE POINT FOUR SIX TO

00:56:43.333 --> 00:56:45.001
THREE POINT TWO SIX IS THAT

00:56:45.068 --> 00:56:46.169
ACCURATE THAT'S CORRECT.

00:56:46.236 --> 00:56:47.871
IN WHY I FIND THAT UNFORTUNATE I

00:56:47.937 --> 00:56:50.840
THINK THAT BUYS IN TO THE IDEA.

00:56:50.907 --> 00:56:53.109
THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:54.477
THE CEILING IS OPPOSE OF FLOOR

00:56:54.544 --> 00:56:55.612
THERE'S NOTHING THAT SAYS.

00:56:55.678 --> 00:56:58.681
WE CAN'T EVEN INCREASE IT MORE

00:56:58.748 --> 00:57:00.083
THAN THE PROPOSED NOW PROPOSES

00:57:00.150 --> 00:57:01.651
THREE POINT TWO SIX SO I JUST I

00:57:01.718 --> 00:57:02.719
JUST THINK THAT THAT'S

00:57:02.786 --> 00:57:04.020
UNFORTUNATE I THINK SHE WILL OF

00:57:04.087 --> 00:57:07.323
OF THREE POINT -- TWO SIX OKAY

00:57:07.390 --> 00:57:09.025
IF IT EATS INTO THE GENERAL FUND

00:57:09.092 --> 00:57:10.460
THAT GOES BEYOND THE CEILING I'M

00:57:10.527 --> 00:57:11.961
QUITE FINE WITHOUT I THINK

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:13.196
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM SHOULD BE

00:57:13.263 --> 00:57:14.464
FINE WITH THAT.

00:57:14.531 --> 00:57:15.031
BUT AGAIN WILL AND ONE THING

00:57:15.098 --> 00:57:15.932
ONLY COME FOR WHAT IS

00:57:15.999 --> 00:57:16.866
CONSISTENTLY IN THIS HEARING

00:57:18.735 --> 00:57:20.203
CONSISTENTLY ACT.

00:57:20.270 --> 00:57:21.704
AS THOUGH PROPOSITION NINETY IS

00:57:21.771 --> 00:57:25.675
THE CEILING OPPOSED TO THE FLOOR

00:57:25.742 --> 00:57:26.142
SO THAT THAT'S THAT'S

00:57:26.209 --> 00:57:28.812
UNFORTUNATE -- SO IT'S I I WOULD

00:57:28.878 --> 00:57:29.879
SAY THAT'S A LESSER COMMITMENT.

00:57:29.946 --> 00:57:30.647
TO CALIFORNIA STUDENTS AND A

00:57:30.713 --> 00:57:31.681
LESSER INVESTMENT IN

00:57:31.748 --> 00:57:33.516
CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE WHEN WE WE

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:35.585
WHEN WE WE WE DO THINGS LIKE

00:57:35.652 --> 00:57:41.191
THAT -- SOME OF THE QUESTIONS --

00:57:41.257 --> 00:57:42.192
WELL LET'S TALK ABOUT SPECIAL

00:57:42.258 --> 00:57:44.360
EDUCATION THAT AT THIS PROPOSAL

00:57:44.427 --> 00:57:45.762
AS PROPOSED RIGHT NOW IS TOTALLY

00:57:45.829 --> 00:57:48.932
UNWORKABLE -- IT IS REALLY

00:57:48.998 --> 00:57:50.533
UNFORTUNATE -- IT [inaudible]

00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:52.101
IT.

00:57:52.168 --> 00:57:54.304
I I CANNOT SUPPORT IT IT WILL

00:57:54.370 --> 00:57:55.672
DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE AND

00:57:55.738 --> 00:57:57.307
THAT COULD EASE IN OUR SPECIAL

00:57:57.373 --> 00:57:58.741
EDUCATION FINANCE SYSTEM.

00:57:58.808 --> 00:58:00.109
RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A HUGE PROBLEM

00:58:00.176 --> 00:58:01.211
WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS A BEING

00:58:01.277 --> 00:58:02.478
FUNDED ADEQUATELY NOW WE'RE

00:58:02.545 --> 00:58:04.647
GONNA GO OUT ON I MEAN IT'S LIKE

00:58:04.714 --> 00:58:05.815
YOU KNOW YOUR HOUSE ON FIRE

00:58:05.882 --> 00:58:08.017
SOULS AND YOU DECIDE AT THE SAME

00:58:08.084 --> 00:58:08.585
TIME TO ADD ANOTHER ROOM.

00:58:08.651 --> 00:58:10.220
WE NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THE

00:58:10.286 --> 00:58:11.855
PROBLEM THAT YOU HAVE NOW BEFORE

00:58:11.921 --> 00:58:13.790
YOU VENTURE INTO SOMETHING NEW.

00:58:13.857 --> 00:58:15.225
AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DOES.

00:58:15.291 --> 00:58:16.726
AGAIN IT DOES NOT SOLVE THE

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:18.761
PROBLEM OF NOT ADEQUATELY

00:58:18.828 --> 00:58:21.631
FUNDING EXISTING SPECIAL ED.

00:58:21.698 --> 00:58:23.032
SERVICES AND IN THE STATE OF

00:58:23.099 --> 00:58:25.535
CALIFORNIA -- THE PROPOSAL

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:26.769
BENEFITS JUST A FEW DISTRICT I

00:58:26.836 --> 00:58:28.438
WOULD SAY JUST A FEW MANY

00:58:28.504 --> 00:58:28.972
DISTRICTS FOR SURE BUT NOT

00:58:29.038 --> 00:58:31.341
ENOUGH -- WE SHOULD REALLY

00:58:31.407 --> 00:58:33.176
ADDRESS EQUALIZATION.

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:35.912
BEFORE WE LOOK AT AGAIN GOING

00:58:35.979 --> 00:58:37.380
INTO ANOTHER VENTURE OR MAYBE IS

00:58:37.447 --> 00:58:38.781
EQUALIZATION PLUS THIS YEAR

00:58:38.848 --> 00:58:40.116
PLEASE TAKE A STEP.

00:58:40.183 --> 00:58:42.518
THIS YOUR TOWARDS EQUALIZATION I

00:58:42.585 --> 00:58:43.920
GET WHAT'S GOING ON HERE WE ALL

00:58:43.987 --> 00:58:44.821
KNOW THIS IS ABOUT SOME

00:58:44.888 --> 00:58:46.322
DISTRICTS TEETERING.

00:58:46.389 --> 00:58:47.624
AND THAT THAT'S PROBABLY WHERE

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.392
THE SAME BACK AND I THINK WE'RE

00:58:49.459 --> 00:58:50.860
WE MAY NEED TO ADDRESS THAT.

00:58:50.927 --> 00:58:52.862
CERTAINLY A THROUGH THE BUDGET

00:58:52.929 --> 00:58:54.330
PROCESS WITH THE SAME TIME WE

00:58:54.397 --> 00:58:55.965
NEED DRESS THE SPECIALIST SYSTEM

00:58:56.032 --> 00:58:57.500
ACROSS OUR STATE THIS PROPOSAL

00:58:57.567 --> 00:58:58.835
AS IT SITS COULD ACTUALLY.

00:58:58.902 --> 00:59:01.237
ACT AS A DISINCENTIVE TO SERVE

00:59:01.304 --> 00:59:03.473
STUDENTS -- BECAUSE THE WAY I

00:59:03.539 --> 00:59:05.208
SEE IT RIGHT NOW DISTRICTS THAT.

00:59:05.275 --> 00:59:06.042
THERE'S A LOT DISTRICTS THAT ARE

00:59:06.109 --> 00:59:08.011
INVESTING IN SPECIAL EDUCATION

00:59:08.077 --> 00:59:09.712
OUT OF AND ULTIMATELY THAT KEEPS

00:59:09.779 --> 00:59:10.613
OUR SPECIAL ED RATS LOW BECAUSE

00:59:10.680 --> 00:59:11.848
THEY'RE HELPING KIDS EARLY.

00:59:11.915 --> 00:59:13.850
THE CATCHING THEIR NEEDS EARLY

00:59:13.917 --> 00:59:14.951
AND IF THIS MAY ACT AS A

00:59:15.018 --> 00:59:16.486
DISINCENTIVE FOR DISTRICTS TO DO

00:59:16.552 --> 00:59:19.689
THAT I THINK THAT WOULD.

00:59:19.756 --> 00:59:21.024
HARM CHILDREN.

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:21.658
IN OUR STATE AND CERTAINLY HARM

00:59:21.724 --> 00:59:22.926
US ON THE FISCAL FRONT.

00:59:22.992 --> 00:59:24.394
IN -- IN THE LONG RUN I MEAN

00:59:24.460 --> 00:59:26.629
THIS COULD DISCOURAGE EARLY

00:59:26.696 --> 00:59:29.599
INTERVENTION AND INCLUSION.

00:59:29.666 --> 00:59:30.934
S. OF ROSAL SITS TODAY.

00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:32.902
AND IT PUNISHES THE DISTRICTS

00:59:32.969 --> 00:59:34.771
THAT ARE A THAT ARE ENGAGED IN

00:59:34.837 --> 00:59:37.573
THAT ARE VERY PROACTIVE TODAY --

00:59:37.640 --> 00:59:39.342
SO THAT THE THAT'S I HOPE THE

00:59:39.409 --> 00:59:40.710
COMMITTEE WILL TAKE A CLOSE LOOK

00:59:40.777 --> 00:59:41.945
AT THAT PROPOSAL.

00:59:42.011 --> 00:59:43.880
BECAUSE AGAIN I IT'S IT'S JUST

00:59:43.947 --> 00:59:44.447
NOT WORKABLE.

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:47.317
AND IT IS NOT THAT SOUND POLICY

00:59:47.383 --> 00:59:54.490
FROM MY PERSPECTIVE -- I KNOW

00:59:54.557 --> 00:59:55.858
MISTER MEDINA I DON'T LOSE YOUR

00:59:55.925 --> 00:59:56.726
HOUSE YOU MISTER MEDIAN I KNOW

00:59:56.793 --> 00:59:57.860
HAS A BILL THAT'S BEAST

00:59:57.927 --> 00:59:58.494
EQUALIZATION SO AGAIN I HOPE.

00:59:58.561 --> 00:59:59.329
EQUALIZATION IS A MAJOR PART OF

00:59:59.395 --> 01:00:00.830
THIS COMMITTEES CONVERSATION AS

01:00:00.897 --> 01:00:04.801
WE'VE FORMULATE OUR PROPOSAL --

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.369
AND ANOTHER QUESTION FOR THE

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.771
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- DATA

01:00:08.838 --> 01:00:10.006
SHOWS THAT SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS

01:00:10.073 --> 01:00:11.774
ATTRACT MORE LOW INCOME STUDENTS

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:13.142
TO THE TEACHING FIELD BECAUSE

01:00:13.209 --> 01:00:14.377
LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE

01:00:14.444 --> 01:00:16.012
RELUCTANT TO TAKE ON NEW LOANS.

01:00:16.079 --> 01:00:18.147
AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:00:18.214 --> 01:00:20.083
FOCUSING ON LOAN FORGET LOAN

01:00:20.149 --> 01:00:21.317
FORGIVENESS.

01:00:21.384 --> 01:00:22.518
OVER SCHOLARSHIPS AND I DON'T

01:00:22.585 --> 01:00:23.386
KNOW IF THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:25.154
FINANCE HAD ANY COMMENT ON THAT.

01:00:25.221 --> 01:00:26.222
I JUST WONDER FROM A POLICY

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:27.657
STANDPOINT IF WE SHOULD BE GOING

01:00:27.724 --> 01:00:29.792
TO THE PATH OF OF OF

01:00:29.859 --> 01:00:31.761
SCHOLARSHIPS AS OPPOSED TO LOAN

01:00:31.828 --> 01:00:33.229
FORGIVENESS DOES ANYONE WISH TO

01:00:33.296 --> 01:00:36.099
COMMENT ON I CAN I CAN NOT OPINE

01:00:36.165 --> 01:00:37.400
SPECIFICALLY.

01:00:37.467 --> 01:00:39.168
I DON'T COVER THAT THAT AREA I

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:40.870
DON'T KNOW THAT WE HAVE A

01:00:40.937 --> 01:00:42.305
BENEFICIAL COMMENT THAT'S OKAY.

01:00:42.372 --> 01:00:43.506
SO JUST REAL QUICK MISTER DONALD

01:00:43.573 --> 01:00:45.108

01:00:45.174 --> 01:00:46.976

01:01:53.543 --> 01:01:54.610

COMPUTER SCIENCE EDUCATION IS

01:01:56.579 --> 01:01:58.448
GOING TO TAKE PLACE AT THE LOCAL

01:02:15.198 --> 01:02:15.698
AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BECAUSE I

01:02:15.765 --> 01:02:16.899
REALLY THINK.

01:02:16.966 --> 01:02:19.235
THIS CAPACITY HAS TO BE

01:02:19.302 --> 01:02:20.803

YOU KNOW. SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

01:02:27.643 --> 01:02:28.578
DOLLARS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

01:02:28.644 --> 01:02:29.445
ATTACK AGAIN DEVELOP THE

01:02:29.512 --> 01:02:31.380
CAPACITY TO TO DELIVER THIS

01:02:31.447 --> 01:02:33.249
EDUCATION THE LOCAL LEVEL WITH

01:02:33.316 --> 01:02:34.317
THE MONEY MUCH.

01:02:34.383 --> 01:02:36.586
BETTER SPENT THANK YOU AND JUST

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:41.390
ONE OTHER COMMENT ON PROPOSITION --

01:02:41.457 --> 01:02:44.060
SIXTY FOUR IS.

01:02:44.127 --> 01:02:46.696
WE WANT TO SEE I THE PROPOSAL --

01:02:46.762 --> 01:02:47.330
SIX TO SEVEN EIGHTY POINT FIVE

01:02:47.396 --> 01:02:48.598
MILLION IN PROPOSITION SIXTY

01:02:48.664 --> 01:02:49.565
FOUR FUNDS TO SUBSIDIZE

01:02:49.632 --> 01:02:51.367
CHILDCARE FOR SCHOOL AGE

01:02:51.434 --> 01:02:53.169
CHILDREN AND I JUST WONDER.

01:02:53.236 --> 01:02:55.638
WHY WE PUSHING CHILD CARE --

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:57.206
MORE SO THAN THE OUR EXISTING

01:02:57.273 --> 01:02:58.608
ASUS PROGRAM.

01:02:58.674 --> 01:03:00.476
THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WHICH

01:03:00.543 --> 01:03:15.324
TO OPINE ON THE GOOD MORNING

01:03:15.391 --> 01:03:15.992
LISA RESIDENTS GIVE A DEPARTMENT

01:03:16.058 --> 01:03:17.226
OF FINANCE SO IT'S NOT THAT IT'S

01:03:17.293 --> 01:03:18.828
NOT PUSHING A SAYS I THINK THE

01:03:18.895 --> 01:03:19.562
IDEA IS THAT.

01:03:19.629 --> 01:03:20.663
OTHER THOUGHT AS THE EARLIER

01:03:20.730 --> 01:03:23.099
INTERVENTION -- WITH REGARDS TO

01:03:23.166 --> 01:03:25.768
SUBSTANCE ABUSE WOULD BE MORE

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:29.438
ADVANTAGEOUS. FOR ITS GLAZER ONE

01:03:29.505 --> 01:03:29.772
MORE TIME SO.

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:31.140
THE PROPOSAL REALLY WASN'T FOR A

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:32.041
SAYS IT'S A SEPARATE PROGRAM I

01:03:32.108 --> 01:03:34.577
THINK YOU UNDERSTAND THAT ASUS

01:03:34.644 --> 01:03:37.079
IS -- THE IDEA IS THAT THE EARLY

01:03:37.146 --> 01:03:39.749
INTERVENTION WITH REGARDS TO

01:03:39.815 --> 01:03:43.152
SETTING UP AS A CHILD SPACE --

01:03:43.219 --> 01:03:45.188
WOULD LEAD TO BETTER OUTCOMES.

01:03:45.254 --> 01:03:48.758
SO WHETHER OR NOT -- SO WHAT

01:03:48.824 --> 01:03:49.425
WHAT ARE THEY GONNA DO WITH THE

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:50.159
MONEY.

01:03:50.226 --> 01:03:51.561
THEY'RE GOING TO PUT OUT MORE --

01:03:51.627 --> 01:03:53.095
ALTERNATE PAYMENTS LOTS FOR

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:55.731
STUDENTS APPROXIMATELY ABOUT

01:03:55.798 --> 01:03:56.332
EIGHTY FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS FOR

01:03:56.399 --> 01:03:57.900
STUDENTS FOR SLOTS FOR WHAT I'M

01:03:57.967 --> 01:04:01.337
SORRY FIRST FOR CHILDREN. FOR

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:03.472
CHILDCARE PER CHILD CARE YES

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:05.074
THEIR SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN

01:04:05.141 --> 01:04:05.374
[inaudible]

01:04:05.441 --> 01:04:06.876
CORRECT.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:08.678
THE SO THE PROPOSAL IS CHANGED

01:04:08.744 --> 01:04:10.046
SLIGHTLY SINCE THE EIGHT PAGES

01:04:10.112 --> 01:04:11.414
AND AGAIN WE APOLOGIZE FOR THE

01:04:11.480 --> 01:04:12.715
CONFUSION.

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:14.350
WITH THIS CHANGE THERE'S WHAT

01:04:14.417 --> 01:04:15.451
THERE IS MANY THINGS LOOKED AT

01:04:15.518 --> 01:04:16.552
WITH THIS FUNDING AND IT MOVED

01:04:16.619 --> 01:04:19.155
RATHER QUICKLY SO THE TALKING

01:04:19.222 --> 01:04:20.189
POINTS IN THE EIGHT PAGES ARE.

01:04:20.256 --> 01:04:22.325
NOT WHERE WE ARE AT THE PROPOSAL

01:04:22.391 --> 01:04:24.227
AT THIS POINT IN TIME SO THAT

01:04:24.293 --> 01:04:25.361
I'LL TURN IT SO I DON'T ASK HIM

01:04:25.428 --> 01:04:25.928
A QUESTION OF COMMON BECAUSE

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.263
WHAT I HAVE IS HERE THAT IT'S

01:04:27.330 --> 01:04:28.564
EIGHTY POINT FIVE MILLION FROM

01:04:28.631 --> 01:04:30.533
PROP. SIXTY FOUR TO SUBSIDIZE

01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:32.301
CHILDCARE FOR SCHOOL AGE

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.236
CHILDREN.

01:04:33.302 --> 01:04:34.770
AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT SPECIFIC

01:04:34.837 --> 01:04:36.405
PROGRAM THEY WOULD BE TALKING

01:04:36.472 --> 01:04:37.840
ABOUT MAYBE THE CHAIRED AS BUT

01:04:37.907 --> 01:04:41.377
AGAIN I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WOULD

01:04:41.444 --> 01:04:43.179
BE BETTER FOLDED IN ASUS.

01:04:43.246 --> 01:04:44.413
I THAT THAT THAT'S KIND OF MY MY

01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:45.281
QUESTION A YOU KNOW THE ANSWER

01:04:45.348 --> 01:04:47.950
RIGHT NOW -- BUT THAT AND ONE

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:49.619
DAUGHTER'S CLOTHES ON FULL DAY

01:04:49.685 --> 01:04:50.186
KINDERGARTEN SO THESE MISTER

01:04:50.253 --> 01:04:52.688
CHAIR -- THE PROPOSAL MAY BE A

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:54.857
NET NEGATIVE FOR THOSE WHO WISH

01:04:54.924 --> 01:04:56.492
TO PARTICIPATE IN A THE WAY IT'S

01:04:56.559 --> 01:04:58.761
WRITTEN -- BECAUSE IT MAY IMPACT

01:04:58.828 --> 01:05:00.062
FUTURE ELIGIBILITY FOR STATE

01:05:00.129 --> 01:05:02.365
BOND FUNDS FOR SOME SOME LOCALS

01:05:02.431 --> 01:05:02.865
WHO DO.

01:05:02.932 --> 01:05:04.934
TAKE THAT MONEY -- SO THE

01:05:05.001 --> 01:05:06.836
DISINCENTIVE SHOULD BE CORRECTED

01:05:06.902 --> 01:05:07.770
THAT'S RETAIN -- THAT'S FOR

01:05:07.837 --> 01:05:10.906
APPLYING OR GETTING -- SOME OF

01:05:10.973 --> 01:05:14.910
THAT -- NOW 600- MILLION DOLLARS --

01:05:14.977 --> 01:05:19.949
IN -- TO CONVERT THE CANDOR

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:20.583
FACILITY FOR THAT I TURN IT BACK

01:05:20.650 --> 01:05:21.784
TO YOU MISTER.

01:05:21.851 --> 01:05:22.418
THANK YOU I KNOW WE HAVE A FEW

01:05:22.485 --> 01:05:23.252
OTHER QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:24.553
JUMP RIGHT IN YOU CAN STICK

01:05:24.620 --> 01:05:26.122
STICK AROUND HERE FOR FOR THE

01:05:26.188 --> 01:05:27.957
PROP SIXTY FOUR I GUESS THERE'S

01:05:28.024 --> 01:05:29.392
TWO THINGS THAT I WANTED TO

01:05:29.458 --> 01:05:31.460
FOLLOW UP ON ONE THE OBVIOUS

01:05:31.527 --> 01:05:32.261
THING.

01:05:32.328 --> 01:05:34.196
WHEN I VOTED FOR PROP SIXTY FOUR

01:05:34.263 --> 01:05:35.431
ANSWERED ALL OF YOU?

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:36.799
WE THOUGHT TV COMMERCIALS IT

01:05:36.866 --> 01:05:38.934
SAID THREE THINGS WE SHOULD TAX

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.436
MARIJUANA.

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:42.104
WE SHOULD REGULATE MARIJUANA WE

01:05:42.171 --> 01:05:42.938
SHOULD USE THE MONEY FOR

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.106
PROGRAMS LIKE AFTER SCHOOL

01:05:44.173 --> 01:05:46.008
PROGRAMS IT WAS ON THE TV

01:05:46.075 --> 01:05:48.711
COMMERCIAL THE CAMPAIGN BROCHURE.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.012
THE BALLOT STATEMENT.

01:05:50.079 --> 01:05:51.847
WE LOVE CHILD CARE PROGRAMS BUT

01:05:51.914 --> 01:05:53.449
NOT ONCE DID WE TELL THE VOTERS.

01:05:53.516 --> 01:05:55.384
IT WOULD EXPAND CHILDCARE

01:05:55.451 --> 01:05:56.952
PROGRAM SO THAT'S I THINK A BIG

01:05:57.019 --> 01:05:58.421
PROBLEM WITH WHAT WE TOLD THE

01:05:58.487 --> 01:06:01.090
VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA -- NUMBER

01:06:01.157 --> 01:06:02.992

WITH THE ELECTORATE WHAT THAT

01:06:09.632 --> 01:06:10.700
WAS FOR AND I THINK IT'S

01:06:10.766 --> 01:06:12.268
DISINGENUOUS.

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:14.070
AND THEN TO THE SECOND ISSUE MY

01:06:14.136 --> 01:06:16.339
UNDERSTANDING IS THAT REVISED

01:06:16.405 --> 01:06:17.840

THEIR YOU WOULD THINK ARE FOR

01:06:34.223 --> 01:06:35.825
OLDER KIDS WHICH IS WHY.

01:06:35.891 --> 01:06:37.827
THE ASUS PROGRAM MAKES SO MUCH

01:06:37.893 --> 01:06:39.295
SENSE THOSE OF THE POPULATION

01:06:39.362 --> 01:06:41.764
WERE KIDS ARE MOST AT RISK WITH

01:06:41.831 --> 01:06:42.965

01:07:50.032 --> 01:07:52.334
FUNDING IS WOEFULLY INADEQUATE.

01:07:52.401 --> 01:07:54.437
FOR OUR SCHOOLS AND THEN NOW WE

ANGELES TIMES.

01:08:07.583 --> 01:08:10.319
THAT -- THAT TALKS ABOUT HOW.

01:08:33.042 --> 01:08:34.743
NEEDS.

01:08:34.810 --> 01:08:35.411
THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCE IS

01:08:35.478 --> 01:08:37.613
THAT CALIFORNIA ROUTINELY UNDER

01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:39.849

DONALD CONCERNS ABOUT THE

01:10:38.601 --> 01:10:40.869
SPECIALIST CATION I THINK.

01:10:40.936 --> 01:10:42.471
THE EQUALIZATION SHOULD BE OUR

01:10:42.538 --> 01:10:44.139
NUMBER ONE PRIORITY IN TERMS OF

THAT WE'RE SEEING IN OUR IN OUR

01:11:02.791 --> 01:11:03.993
IN OUR DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE

01:11:04.059 --> 01:11:04.893

TO REITERATE I THINK WITH MY

01:11:21.810 --> 01:11:22.611
COLLEAGUES HAVE ALREADY SAID BUT

01:11:22.678 --> 01:11:25.014
I I THINK THE BIGGEST THING FOR

ME IS.

01:11:26.782 --> 01:11:28.550

AND AND I I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY

01:11:40.729 --> 01:11:43.966
WE CAN AT LEAST MOVE TOWARDS --

01:11:44.033 --> 01:11:45.934
EQUALIZATION FUNDING IN SOME WAY

01:11:46.001 --> 01:11:47.703

IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- ANY OF

01:11:52.241 --> 01:11:53.642
THE LA OWES REPORT I THINK JUST

01:11:53.709 --> 01:11:55.711
LAID IT OUT EXACTLY ALL THE

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.379
PROBLEMS YOU'RE ALLOCATING FUNDS

01:11:57.446 --> 01:11:58.547
ACCORDING TO THE NUMBER OF

01:11:58.614 --> 01:11:59.848
STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES.

01:11:59.915 --> 01:12:00.916

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:07.122
EDUCATION SERVICES DOES THAT ARE.

01:12:07.189 --> 01:12:10.092
DOING EARLY INTERVENTION AND AND

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.127
HAVING SUCCESS -- THAT DOESN'T

01:12:12.194 --> 01:12:13.062
SEEM TO ME TO BE THE RIGHT

01:12:13.128 --> 01:12:14.763
APPROACH A NEW CATEGORICAL

01:12:14.830 --> 01:12:16.131
PROGRAM WITHOUT EVEN MORE

01:12:16.198 --> 01:12:17.566
COMPLEXITY. TO THE STATE'S

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:21.170

SUCH AS FUNDING EQUALIZATION

01:12:29.144 --> 01:12:30.379
WOULD DISTRIBUTE THE FUNNY MORE

HISTORICAL FUNDING INEQUITIES

01:12:33.749 --> 01:12:34.983
WITHOUT CREATING FISCAL

01:12:35.050 --> 01:12:36.151
INCENTIVES.

01:12:36.218 --> 01:12:38.287
IT FISCAL INCENTIVES TO KEEP

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:41.523
STUDENTS IN SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:12:41.590 --> 01:12:42.591
MAN I WOULD NOTICE MEETING WAS

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:44.093
SO MYSELF AS HERE LOCALLY I MEAN

01:12:44.159 --> 01:12:45.794
A LOT OF THESE SPECIAL EDUCATION

01:12:45.861 --> 01:12:47.629
TEACHERS ARE NOT JUST DEALING

01:12:47.696 --> 01:12:47.930
WITH KIDS.

01:12:47.996 --> 01:12:50.299
WITH THE CANNOT JUST BE HELPFUL

01:12:50.365 --> 01:12:51.667
THE KIDS THAT ARE IN I. E. PEAS.

01:12:51.734 --> 01:12:53.635
THEY CAN BE HELPFUL KIDS OR DEAL

01:12:53.702 --> 01:12:55.604
WITH A LOT OTHER ISSUES.

01:12:55.671 --> 01:12:57.473
MENTAL HEALTH.

01:12:57.539 --> 01:12:58.307
OTHER THINGS THAT WERE SEEN IN A

01:12:58.373 --> 01:13:00.409
IN OURS IN OUR SCHOOLS -- YOU

01:13:00.476 --> 01:13:01.944
KNOW SO LOOK I JUST THINK THIS

01:13:02.010 --> 01:13:03.512
IS THE COMPLETE WRONG APPROACH.

01:13:03.579 --> 01:13:05.047
AND YOU KNOW I'M REALLY HOPING

01:13:05.114 --> 01:13:07.416
THAT YOU KNOW I I I FEEL LIKE

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:07.950
THAT'S THE TENOR OF THIS

01:13:08.016 --> 01:13:08.784
COMMITTEE.

01:13:08.851 --> 01:13:10.352
AND AND I THINK ALSO ON THE

01:13:10.419 --> 01:13:12.187
SENATE SIDE IS THAT WE PUSH

01:13:12.254 --> 01:13:13.255
FORWARD.

01:13:13.322 --> 01:13:14.857
TOWARDS MORE OF A OF A

01:13:14.923 --> 01:13:18.994
EQUALIZATION FUNDING -- METHOD --

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:19.995
AND SO I AM HOPING THAT WE CA

01:13:20.062 --> 01:13:22.331
DO THAT I WOULD ECHO SOME OF THE

01:13:22.397 --> 01:13:23.732
COMMENTS THAT.

01:13:23.799 --> 01:13:25.334
YOU KNOW MY COLLEAGUE MADE.

01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:27.269
I AM CONCERNED ABOUT WHY NOT

01:13:27.336 --> 01:13:29.705
FOCUS ON ACES I MEAN ACES WE

01:13:29.772 --> 01:13:31.106
WERE JUST HAD A MEETING ON THIS.

01:13:31.173 --> 01:13:33.642
HEARING ON THIS LAST WEEK --

01:13:33.709 --> 01:13:34.510
WHERE WE TALKED ABOUT THESE

01:13:34.576 --> 01:13:35.778
GREAT PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING

01:13:35.844 --> 01:13:37.212
IMPLEMENTED THROUGH THE ASUS

01:13:37.279 --> 01:13:39.848
FUNDING -- AND I FEEL LIKE WE'RE

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:41.450
SORT OF SHORT CHANGING THAT AND

01:13:41.517 --> 01:13:43.252
I THINK WE HAVE.

01:13:43.318 --> 01:13:44.453
TO I REALIZE THAT THE CHILD CARE

01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:46.321
DISCUSSION KINDA GETS CAUGHT UP

01:13:46.388 --> 01:13:50.993
IN THE IN THE PRE K. AND AND BUT

01:13:51.059 --> 01:13:52.728
THEY ARE DIFFERENT.

01:13:52.795 --> 01:13:54.196
THEY ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS

01:13:54.263 --> 01:13:55.731
YOU KNOW AND I I DON'T THINK WE

01:13:55.798 --> 01:13:56.932
SHOULD LOOK AT EDUCATION AS

01:13:56.999 --> 01:13:58.801
CHILD CARE.

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:01.370
NECESSARILY RIGHT -- AND AND

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.004
MAYBE THAT'S SORT OF THE PROBLEM

01:14:02.070 --> 01:14:03.071
LIKE.

01:14:03.138 --> 01:14:05.440
WE ARE EXPECTING MORE MORE MORE

01:14:05.507 --> 01:14:07.276
OF OUR TEACHERS AND EDUCATORS TO

01:14:07.342 --> 01:14:09.378
DO THINGS THAT REALLY ARE.

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:11.847
NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY AND AND

01:14:11.914 --> 01:14:13.982
IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR THEM TO DO

01:14:14.049 --> 01:14:15.651
ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT THINGS.

01:14:15.717 --> 01:14:17.186
AND SO.

01:14:17.252 --> 01:14:18.187
I THINK WE NEED TO REALLY WORK

01:14:18.253 --> 01:14:20.255
ON HOW WE SEPARATE THAT OUT A

01:14:20.322 --> 01:14:21.490
LITTLE BIT CERTAINLY THERE'S

01:14:21.557 --> 01:14:23.792
THERE IS THERE IS A NEED FOR

01:14:23.859 --> 01:14:25.327
WORKING PARENTS.

01:14:25.394 --> 01:14:27.796
CHILD CARE COSTS ARE EXTREMELY

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:30.966
HIGH -- YOU KNOW TO TO FIGURE

01:14:31.033 --> 01:14:32.467
THAT.

01:14:32.534 --> 01:14:33.101
YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOME RESOURCES

01:14:33.168 --> 01:14:34.803
THERE BUT I DON'T WANNA MAKE SET

01:14:34.870 --> 01:14:37.406
UP WITH WHAT ARE LEGITIMATE.

01:14:37.472 --> 01:14:38.874
WHAT WHAT WHAT?

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.876
THE FOCUS OF OUR BUT IT SHOULD

01:14:40.943 --> 01:14:43.111
BE WHICH IS EDUCATING.

01:14:43.178 --> 01:14:45.347
OUR KIDS AND ENSURING THAT THEY

01:14:45.414 --> 01:14:47.316
HAVE THE TOOLS TO SUCCEED -- AND

01:14:47.382 --> 01:14:48.750
THAT THAT'S WHERE OUR EDUCATION

01:14:48.817 --> 01:14:51.520
DOLLARS HAVE TO BE FOCUSED THEY

01:14:51.587 --> 01:14:53.655
HAVE TO BE FOCUSED ON THAT.

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:55.157
ON THAT EFFORT AND SO -- YOU

01:14:55.224 --> 01:14:56.425
KNOW THAT WOULD BE MY COMMENTS

01:14:56.491 --> 01:14:58.360
AND BUT THAT'LL JUST TURNED BACK

01:14:58.427 --> 01:14:59.528
TO THE CHAIR [inaudible]

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:01.830

01:15:04.333 --> 01:15:05.334
BE ALLOWED DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:15:05.400 --> 01:15:07.135
SO I'M ON THE SPECIAL AT I

01:15:07.202 --> 01:15:09.338
CONCUR THAT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT.

WE NEED TO ADDRESS AND PUT MORE

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:14.076

AND HERE FOR FROM DISTRICTS ALL

01:15:21.583 --> 01:15:22.985
OUR DOWNSTATE AND THE NUMBER OF

01:15:23.051 --> 01:15:24.253
STUDENTS AND SPECIAL THAT ARE

01:15:24.319 --> 01:15:26.388
GOING UP AS ARE THE COSTS OF THE

01:15:26.455 --> 01:15:27.956
THE ATTENTION THIS IS IMPORTANT.

01:15:28.023 --> 01:15:30.626
BUT THE REMEDY IN THE PROPOSAL

01:15:30.692 --> 01:15:33.061
JUST ISN'T FAIR -- IT LOOKS LIKE

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:34.696
IT HELPS LOS ANGELES

01:15:34.763 --> 01:15:36.531
SIGNIFICANTLY AND THEY LIKE THE

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:37.733
PROPOSAL AND YOU KNOW THEY'RE

01:15:37.799 --> 01:15:38.333
HURTING.

01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.135
BUT A LOT OF OTHER DISTRICTS ARE

01:15:40.202 --> 01:15:40.936
HURTING AS WELL.

01:15:41.003 --> 01:15:42.871
SO WANTED TO GIVE YOU THE CHANCE

WE MISSING HERE AND AND WHY

01:15:49.044 --> 01:15:50.545
WON'T YOU CONSIDER THE

01:15:50.612 --> 01:15:53.382
EQUALIZATION APPROACH AS OPPOSED.

01:15:53.448 --> 01:15:54.983
TO THE PROPOSAL IN THE BUDGET SO

01:15:55.050 --> 01:15:56.118
FIRST OF ALL LET ME WE

01:15:56.184 --> 01:15:57.686
APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS AND WE

01:15:57.753 --> 01:15:58.520
HAVE BEEN AN ONGOING

01:15:58.587 --> 01:15:59.588
CONVERSATIONS I WILL CONTINUE

01:15:59.655 --> 01:16:01.056
THIS CONVERSATION OUTGOING THIS

01:16:01.123 --> 01:16:04.026
PROPOSAL REALLY IS DEDICATED.

01:16:04.092 --> 01:16:05.994
TO ADDRESS SEEN -- KIND OF

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.829
EQUITY ISSUES IN A SPECIAL

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.798
EDUCATION AND ITS TARGETS THE

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:12.567
HIGH -- IMPACT AREAS SUCH AS

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:14.436
YOUR LOW INCOME SPECIAL

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:16.071
EDUCATION STUDENTS SIR.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:17.439
AND THE FUNDING IS DEDICATED

01:16:17.506 --> 01:16:18.340
REALLY TOOK TRYING.

01:16:18.407 --> 01:16:19.641
TO PROVIDE MORE FUNDING FOR

01:16:19.708 --> 01:16:20.509
EARLY INTERVENTION FOR THE

01:16:20.575 --> 01:16:22.177
STUDENTS THERE AREN'T THAT TEND

01:16:22.244 --> 01:16:23.812
TO HAVE MORE AND HIGHER NEEDS

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:25.147
MAYBE NOT NECESSARILY SPECIAL

01:16:25.213 --> 01:16:26.548
EDUCATION NEEDS BUT IT COULD

01:16:26.615 --> 01:16:28.250
LEAD TO SPECIAL EDUCATION.

01:16:28.317 --> 01:16:33.655
I'M AND IMPROVED OUTCOMES IS IS

01:16:33.722 --> 01:16:35.958
OUR THOUGHT.

01:16:36.024 --> 01:16:37.259
IT IS CERTAINLY NOT THAT WEREN'T.

01:16:37.326 --> 01:16:37.893
EQUITY A GIVE EQUALIZATION IS

01:16:37.960 --> 01:16:38.493
NOT PART OF OUR CONVERSATION

01:16:38.560 --> 01:16:39.494
BECAUSE WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT NOT

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:40.529
ALL DISTRICTS BENEFIT FROM

01:16:40.595 --> 01:16:42.097
EQUALIZATION -- BUT WE DO THINK

01:16:42.164 --> 01:16:43.398
THAT WE'RE WE'RE WILLING TO HAVE

01:16:43.465 --> 01:16:45.100
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS WITH WITH

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.601
REGARDS TO THE FORMULA.

01:16:46.668 --> 01:16:48.403
YEAH.

01:16:48.470 --> 01:16:50.939
I THINK AND THINKING ABOUT THE

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:52.674
OVERALL PROP NINETY EIGHT ISSUE.

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:54.609
I CONCUR WITH OUR EDUCATION

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:56.645
CHAIR MISTER O'DONNELL.

01:16:56.712 --> 01:16:57.612
IN MISTER MARTUCCI WHOSE LEAD IN

01:16:57.679 --> 01:16:59.581
THAT CONVERSATION ON TAKING A

01:16:59.648 --> 01:17:02.451
LOOK AT LCF AFFAN ITS ADEQUACY.

01:17:02.517 --> 01:17:04.186
AND THERE RIGHT IT'S IT'S A

01:17:04.252 --> 01:17:05.654
DISGRACE THAT WORD WOEFULLY

01:17:05.721 --> 01:17:08.090
UNDER FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS --

01:17:08.156 --> 01:17:09.324
FORTY FIRST THE NATION CERTAINLY

01:17:09.391 --> 01:17:10.659
SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS COULD MAKE

01:17:10.726 --> 01:17:12.227
BETTER DECISIONS MY OWN DISTRICT

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:13.595
RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO.

01:17:13.662 --> 01:17:15.597
I THINK THEY MADE -- SOME REALLY

01:17:15.664 --> 01:17:17.165
TERRIBLE BUDGET DECISIONS TO GET

01:17:17.232 --> 01:17:18.834
IN THIS PROBLEM AND THEY NEED

01:17:18.900 --> 01:17:20.569
OWN TO BALANCING THEIR CHECKBOOK

01:17:20.635 --> 01:17:22.237
RIGHT OR WRONG BUT THE BIG

01:17:22.304 --> 01:17:23.672
PICTURE IS THAT.

01:17:23.739 --> 01:17:26.608
WE ARE STARVING OUR OUR

01:17:26.675 --> 01:17:27.743
DISTRICTS WHEN YOU LOOK AT OUR

01:17:27.809 --> 01:17:29.611
HIGH COST OF LIVING AND WHAT THE

01:17:29.678 --> 01:17:31.847
TEACHERS NEED TO GET TO MAKE A

01:17:31.913 --> 01:17:33.615
LIVING WE SAW THE ARTICLE FEW

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:34.449
WEEKS GO IN THAT.

01:17:34.516 --> 01:17:37.552
AREA AND TEACHERS THERE -- THEY

01:17:37.619 --> 01:17:38.520
CAN EVEN.

01:17:38.587 --> 01:17:39.521
IF THEY CAME TO LIVE OUTSIDE OF

01:17:39.588 --> 01:17:42.024
THEIR YOU KNOW GRANDMA'S HOUSE

01:17:42.090 --> 01:17:42.224
SIR.

01:17:42.290 --> 01:17:44.426
JOINING UP AS YOU SAID KITE YOU

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:45.794
KNOW THREE AND FOUR TEACHERS PER

01:17:45.861 --> 01:17:47.996
AN APARTMENT AND THAT'S WHY IT

01:17:48.063 --> 01:17:49.765
COSTS SO MUCH. TO TO RUN OUR

01:17:49.831 --> 01:17:55.470
SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND IN SO MANY

01:17:55.537 --> 01:17:57.439
THEIR COUNTIES ACROSS THIS GUY.

01:17:57.506 --> 01:17:57.939
SCHOOL DISTRICTS ACROSS

01:17:58.006 --> 01:17:58.840
CALIFORNIA NOT TO MENTION YOU

01:17:58.907 --> 01:17:59.441
KNOW ALL THE OTHER FIXED COSTS

01:17:59.508 --> 01:18:01.209
WITH -- RETIREMENT AND HEALTH

01:18:01.276 --> 01:18:03.612
CARE AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

01:18:03.678 --> 01:18:05.580
NEED TO TAKE A LOOK AT I THINK

01:18:05.647 --> 01:18:07.749
MORE THAN JUST THIS BUDGET BUT

01:18:07.816 --> 01:18:08.950
THE TECH TALK IN THE VOTERS

01:18:09.017 --> 01:18:10.685
BECAUSE I I DON'T THINK WE CAN

01:18:10.752 --> 01:18:13.021
COMPLAIN ABOUT WILL FULLY --

01:18:13.088 --> 01:18:14.723
FUNDING OUR SCHOOLS.

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:16.658
AND HAVE THE FUNDING ABOUT HALF

01:18:16.725 --> 01:18:18.894
OF WHAT YOU SAID NEW YORK AND

01:18:18.960 --> 01:18:20.462
MASSACHUSETTS HAVE.

01:18:20.529 --> 01:18:21.463
NOT BE WILLING TO GO TO THEM AND

01:18:21.530 --> 01:18:22.664
SAYING WHAT YOU WILLING TO PAY

01:18:22.731 --> 01:18:24.399
YOU CAN HAVE IT BOTH WAYS.

01:18:24.466 --> 01:18:25.500
SO I THINK WE NEED TO DO THAT

01:18:25.567 --> 01:18:27.235
AND AN UPCOMING BALLOT BUT THE

01:18:27.302 --> 01:18:27.702
PROBLEM.

01:18:27.769 --> 01:18:29.471
IS TODAY AND TODAY WE'RE TALKING

01:18:29.538 --> 01:18:32.174
ABOUT THE NINETEEN TWENTY BUDGET.

01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:35.410
AND I I THINK IT'S SO HARD FOR

01:18:35.477 --> 01:18:36.978
THE AVERAGE VOTER TO UNDERSTAND

01:18:37.045 --> 01:18:38.647
CONSTITUENTS UNDERSTAND THAT WE

01:18:38.713 --> 01:18:40.148
HEAR ABOUT THIS TWENTY PLUS.

01:18:40.215 --> 01:18:42.084
BILLION DOLLARS SURPLUS GRANTED

01:18:42.150 --> 01:18:44.619
MAJORITY OF IT IS ONE TIME.

01:18:44.686 --> 01:18:45.687
AND I KNOW THE GOVERNOR

01:18:45.754 --> 01:18:47.422
RIGHTFULLY HAS TRIED AT THE

01:18:47.489 --> 01:18:49.024
SAYING WE'VE INCREASED FUNDING.

01:18:49.091 --> 01:18:51.726
THE LAST FIVE YEARS BY 50% THIS

01:18:51.793 --> 01:18:53.028
HIGHEST AMOUNT OF FUNDING

01:18:53.095 --> 01:18:54.830
CALIFORNIA HISTORY YOU KNOW TELL

01:18:54.896 --> 01:18:55.897
THAT TO DISTRICTS ARE SENDING

01:18:55.964 --> 01:18:57.065
OUT PINK SLIPS TODAY.

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:58.600
IT DOESN'T REALLY HELP THEM AND

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:00.602
SO WITH ALL WE HAVE AN ALL OF

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:04.272
CALIFORNIA'S -- A PRIORITIES --

01:19:04.339 --> 01:19:06.108
THIS IS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE THIS

01:19:06.174 --> 01:19:07.609
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT'S BEING

01:19:07.676 --> 01:19:12.114
ADEQUATELY -- PRIORITIZED AND SO

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.483
THAT IS -- GREATLY DISAPPOINTING

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:15.450
AND CERTAINLY SOMETHING THAT YOU

01:19:15.517 --> 01:19:16.985
KNOW WORK ATTEMPTING TO ADDRESS

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.421
AS WE CLOSE OUT -- THE BUDGET --

01:19:19.488 --> 01:19:20.989
THIS YEAR.

01:19:21.056 --> 01:19:21.756
THAT'S KIND OF MORE OF A

01:19:21.823 --> 01:19:23.325
COMMENTARY NOT NOT A QUESTION

01:19:23.391 --> 01:19:25.227
THERE.

01:19:25.293 --> 01:19:29.297
I DID WANT -- TO ALSO ASK ABOUT

01:19:29.364 --> 01:19:31.600
THE WHO WHO WAS WHICH YOU TALKED

01:19:31.666 --> 01:19:33.268
ABOUT THE THE ECM PROJECTS THAT

01:19:33.335 --> 01:19:38.039
YOU.

01:19:38.106 --> 01:19:41.176
I'M INTERESTED WHAT WHAT WHAT.

01:19:41.243 --> 01:19:43.745
YEAH SEPARATE QUESTIONS.

01:19:43.812 --> 01:19:44.579
GOTCHA GOTCHA.

01:19:44.646 --> 01:19:46.882
YES SO IN THE PROPOSAL YOU YOU

01:19:46.948 --> 01:19:47.983
THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET AS

01:19:48.049 --> 01:19:50.752
FAR AS THE NUMBER OF SLOTS AND

01:19:50.819 --> 01:19:53.588
RESOURCES AVAILABLE BE CHANGED.

01:19:53.655 --> 01:19:55.690
THE THE OUT YEAR AS YOU ACTUALLY

01:19:55.757 --> 01:19:57.025
YEAH YEAH THE I'M YOU CHANGE THE

01:19:57.092 --> 01:19:59.027
OUT YEAR AND THAT THE PRESCHOOL

01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:01.563
FOR ALL KIND OF PROMISE SO --

01:20:01.630 --> 01:20:04.766
WHY IS IT NECESSARY -- TO TO

01:20:04.833 --> 01:20:07.836
ADDRESS THAT IN THIS YEAR'S --

01:20:07.903 --> 01:20:08.837
BUDGET CONCLUSION WHEN IT'S

01:20:08.904 --> 01:20:11.339
REALLY KIND OF AN OUT YEAR

01:20:11.406 --> 01:20:12.674
CONVERSATION AND COMMITMENT.

01:20:12.741 --> 01:20:13.942
SO I APOLOGIZE SO YOU'RE

01:20:14.009 --> 01:20:16.511
WONDERING WHY WE REMOVETHE

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:17.112
TWENTY THOUSAND DOLLAR SO WITH

01:20:17.179 --> 01:20:18.280
PART OF THE AS YOU KNOW

01:20:18.346 --> 01:20:19.748
BUDGETING BALANCING THE BUDGET

01:20:19.814 --> 01:20:21.650
IS NOT A ONE YEAR -- COMMITMENT

01:20:21.716 --> 01:20:23.518
IT'S IT'S OUT SEVERAL YEARS FIVE

01:20:23.585 --> 01:20:25.253
YEARS I BELIEVE AND ONE OF THE

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:26.588
THINGS WE NOTICED AS WE GOT THE

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:28.123
NOON ECONOMIC INDICATORS IS THAT

01:20:28.190 --> 01:20:29.491
REVENUES ARE DROPPING MORE

01:20:29.558 --> 01:20:31.092
SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE OUT YEARS

01:20:31.159 --> 01:20:32.260
THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED.

01:20:32.327 --> 01:20:33.428
SO IN ORDER TO BALANCE THE

01:20:33.495 --> 01:20:35.697
BUDGET IN THE OUT YEARS WE WE

01:20:35.764 --> 01:20:37.132
REMOVE THE SLOTS NOT NECESSARILY

01:20:37.199 --> 01:20:38.533
THE COMMITMENT TO THE SPOTS BUT

01:20:38.600 --> 01:20:39.868
WE REMOVE THE FUNDING.

01:20:39.935 --> 01:20:41.970
IN ORDER TO KIND OF RE GAUGING

01:20:42.037 --> 01:20:43.438
NEXT YEAR WITH THE NEW ECONOMIC

01:20:43.505 --> 01:20:45.440
INDICATORS ON HOW MUCH THE STATE

01:20:45.507 --> 01:20:47.242
CAN AFFORD GOING FORWARD SO

01:20:47.309 --> 01:20:49.377
THERE IS A COMMITMENT -- INTO IT

01:20:49.444 --> 01:20:50.912
WOULD GET TO UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL

01:20:50.979 --> 01:20:52.214
WE ALSO ARE HOPING THAT THE

01:20:52.280 --> 01:20:53.481
MASTER PLAN THAT'S BEEN UP

01:20:53.548 --> 01:20:55.083
PROPOSED WILL ALSO GIVE US A

01:20:55.150 --> 01:20:56.751
BETTER OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE THE

01:20:56.818 --> 01:20:58.119
PRESCHOOL ARE THE SLOTS THAT ARE

01:20:58.186 --> 01:20:59.321
NEEDED IN THE STATE.

01:20:59.387 --> 01:21:03.491
IT MAY BE T. K. IT MAY BE --

01:21:03.558 --> 01:21:04.059
ZERO FOUR ZERO TO FIVE OTHER

01:21:04.125 --> 01:21:04.859
AREAS SO I THINK ALL IDEAS WE

01:21:04.926 --> 01:21:05.927
NEED A NEEDS ASSESSMENT IN THE

01:21:05.994 --> 01:21:07.662
STATE ON EARLY LEARNING IN THIS

01:21:07.729 --> 01:21:08.930
AREA WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND HOW

01:21:08.997 --> 01:21:10.432
WE CAN BETTER FUND IT WITH NOT.

01:21:10.498 --> 01:21:11.633
ONLY GENERAL FUND BUT LEVERAGING

01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:14.536
OTHER RESOURCES WITHIN THE STATE --

01:21:14.603 --> 01:21:17.205
AND IN DETERMINING WHAT POCKETS

01:21:17.272 --> 01:21:19.040
THE STATE THAT DID THAT OF SORTS

01:21:19.107 --> 01:21:21.176
THAT ARE USUALLY SPOKE UP NEED

01:21:21.243 --> 01:21:22.911
THIS THE MOST SO.

01:21:22.978 --> 01:21:23.812
IT'S NOT THE COMMITMENT.

01:21:23.878 --> 01:21:24.579
THAT'S BEEN REMOVED IT'S JUST

01:21:24.646 --> 01:21:26.281
REALLY AT STEPPING BACK AND

01:21:26.348 --> 01:21:27.048
TAKING A LOOK AT WHAT'S THE

01:21:27.115 --> 01:21:28.750
STATE CAN AFFORD TO DO GOING

01:21:28.817 --> 01:21:30.252
FORWARD AND AS FAR AS THE THE

01:21:30.318 --> 01:21:32.387
ACES CONVERSATION THE AFTER

01:21:32.454 --> 01:21:35.056
SCHOOL -- PROGRAM -- ONE I KNOW

01:21:35.123 --> 01:21:36.491
THAT THE STATE LAST COUPLE YEARS

01:21:36.558 --> 01:21:44.633
HAS TAKEN A LOOK AT ISSUES LIKE.

01:21:44.699 --> 01:21:45.667
I TO ASSESS AND HOME CARE

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.135
INDUSTRY -- CERTAINLY ARE EARLY

01:21:47.202 --> 01:21:47.902
EDUCATION OUR OUR OUR OUR

01:21:47.969 --> 01:21:48.937
PRESCHOOL AND AND CHILD CARE

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:49.804
WORK FORCE.

01:21:49.871 --> 01:21:51.273
AND REALIZE THAT COSTS HAVE GONE

01:21:51.339 --> 01:21:51.906
UP CITIES HAVE ENACTED MINIMUM

01:21:51.973 --> 01:21:53.074
WAGE INCREASES CALIFORNIA.

01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:54.743
HAS IT AS WELL.

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.878
AND YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T

01:21:56.945 --> 01:21:59.414
INCREASE -- REV IF YOU INCREASE

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.182
THE RESOURCES FOR THE PROGRAM

01:22:01.249 --> 01:22:03.051
SIDE TO SIMPLE LAWS OF

01:22:03.118 --> 01:22:05.387
MATHEMATICS AND THE YOUR FEET

01:22:05.453 --> 01:22:07.255
YOU'LL SIR FEWER KIDS SO HOW DO

01:22:07.322 --> 01:22:09.858
YOU ATTEMPT TO RECONCILE THAT.

01:22:09.924 --> 01:22:11.293
WITH OUR STATE AFTER SCHOOL

01:22:11.359 --> 01:22:12.460
PROGRAM.

01:22:12.527 --> 01:22:13.762
AND WE HEARD FROM THEM A FEW

01:22:13.828 --> 01:22:17.232
WEEKS AGO SAYING THAT -- YOU

01:22:17.299 --> 01:22:20.268
KNOW THEY'RE GOING -- TO

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:22.170
DECREASE THE NUMBER OF KIDS

01:22:22.237 --> 01:22:22.771
SERVICE IN OUR COMMUNITY SAID

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:23.605
THAT.

01:22:23.672 --> 01:22:25.473
WON'T HAVE A POSITIVE IMPACT FOR

01:22:25.540 --> 01:22:27.108
FOR FAMILIES FOR STUDENTS SHE

01:22:27.175 --> 01:22:28.543
MEANT.

01:22:28.610 --> 01:22:30.245
FOR PUBLIC SAFETY HAZARD FROM

01:22:30.312 --> 01:22:31.780
ALL OVER ADVOCATE SOME.

01:22:31.846 --> 01:22:33.248
WHAT IS THAT WE HAVE ALSO HEARD

01:22:33.315 --> 01:22:34.749
FROM THE UP THE KIDS AND WE DO

01:22:34.816 --> 01:22:36.951
APPRECIATE AND AND RECOGNIZE THE

01:22:37.018 --> 01:22:38.019
IMPORTANCE OF THE AFTER SCHOOL

01:22:38.086 --> 01:22:39.387
PROGRAM IT'S ALSO A PROGRAM

01:22:39.454 --> 01:22:40.922
THAT'S LEVERAGED AT THE LOCAL

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.257
LEVEL IT'S IT'S SHOULD BE A

01:22:42.324 --> 01:22:44.392
LOCAL PRIORITY TO HAVE HELP?

01:22:44.459 --> 01:22:45.794
FUND THESE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS

01:22:45.860 --> 01:22:46.761
THAT THAT WAS ALWAYS MEANT TO BE

01:22:46.828 --> 01:22:48.296
THE STATE CONTRIBUTION WAS ONLY

01:22:48.363 --> 01:22:51.499
A PORTION OF THE FULL FUNDING --

01:22:51.566 --> 01:22:53.034
BUT AGAIN IT'S IT'S A MATTER OF

01:22:53.101 --> 01:22:54.803
LIMITED ON GOING FUNDING AND THE

01:22:54.869 --> 01:22:58.273
ABILITY TO TAKE THE HUNDREDS OF

01:22:58.340 --> 01:22:59.507
MILLIONS THEY REQUEST.

01:22:59.574 --> 01:23:01.009
UP AWAY FROM SOMEONE ELSE THAT

01:23:01.076 --> 01:23:02.410
ALSO PROBABLY NEED THAT SO I I

01:23:02.477 --> 01:23:03.812
MEAN THAT'S THE SITUATION AND AS

01:23:03.878 --> 01:23:05.080
YOU GO TO BALANCE THE BUDGET

01:23:05.146 --> 01:23:06.314
YOU'RE PUTTING TOGETHER YOUR

01:23:06.381 --> 01:23:07.916
FOURTH YOUR PROPOSAL YOU WILL.

01:23:07.982 --> 01:23:08.917
YOU WILL COME ACROSS THE SAME

01:23:08.983 --> 01:23:09.951
AND WE KNOW THAT AFTER SCHOOL

01:23:10.018 --> 01:23:13.121
PROGRAMS OUR CHILD CARE FOR A

01:23:13.188 --> 01:23:14.556
LOT.

01:23:14.622 --> 01:23:15.457
BROWNLEE -- THAT THE

01:23:15.523 --> 01:23:17.659
PARTICIPANTS IN THOSE PROGRAMS I

01:23:17.726 --> 01:23:19.194
JUST WONDER IF YOU CAN ADDRESS

01:23:19.260 --> 01:23:21.029
THE FACT THAT AS I SAID A FEW

01:23:21.096 --> 01:23:22.997
TIMES BEFORE WHEN WE CAMPAIGNED

01:23:23.064 --> 01:23:24.065
ON THIS WHEN.

01:23:24.132 --> 01:23:25.600
FRANKLY THE GOVERNOR WAS THE

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.436
LEADER IN THIS CAMPAIGN PROP.

01:23:28.503 --> 01:23:29.637
SIXTY FOUR HE TALKED ABOUT AFTER

01:23:29.704 --> 01:23:31.740
SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND I BROUGHT

01:23:31.806 --> 01:23:33.208
THE TV COMMERCIAL HERE.

01:23:33.274 --> 01:23:35.043
LAST HEARING AND I READ THE

01:23:35.110 --> 01:23:35.443
BALLOT STATEMENT.

01:23:35.510 --> 01:23:37.045
I READ THE THE BALLOT ARGUMENTS

01:23:37.112 --> 01:23:40.982
AND IT SAID AFTER SCHOOL

01:23:41.049 --> 01:23:42.617
PROGRAMS AND NEVER SAID.

01:23:42.684 --> 01:23:43.651
CHILD CARE INFANT TODDLER

01:23:43.718 --> 01:23:44.753
PROGRAMS WHICH ARE IMPORTANT I

01:23:44.819 --> 01:23:45.353
DON'T WANT TO MISS THOSE SO.

01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.621
HOW DO YOU RECONCILE THAT THAT

01:23:46.688 --> 01:23:49.924
THE PROMISE TO THE ELECTORATE IS --

01:23:49.991 --> 01:23:51.726
A YEAR AND A HALF LATER AND KIND

01:23:51.793 --> 01:23:52.861
OF IGNORED.

01:23:52.927 --> 01:23:56.030
SO I BELIEVE THAT THE USE WITH

01:23:56.097 --> 01:23:57.031
THE APS LOTS DOES FIT THE

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:58.767
WORDING MAYBE NOT THE TELEVISION

01:23:58.833 --> 01:23:59.801
COMMERCIALS BUT IF YOU READ THE

01:23:59.868 --> 01:24:01.436
ACTUAL PROPOSITION SCHOOL

01:24:01.503 --> 01:24:02.537
RETENTION.

01:24:02.604 --> 01:24:06.307
OF IMPROVED OUTCOMES YOU KNOW.

01:24:06.374 --> 01:24:07.108
ADDRESSED IT LOWER IN SUBSTANCE

01:24:07.175 --> 01:24:08.877
ABUSE ARE ALL PART OF IT -- SO

01:24:08.943 --> 01:24:11.079
WE DO THINK THAT THE AP AND

01:24:11.146 --> 01:24:12.447
GIVING THE SLOTS.

01:24:12.514 --> 01:24:14.616
TOO YOUNG FAMILIES AND HELPING

01:24:14.682 --> 01:24:16.985
THE BASE OF THAT FAMILY -- HAVE

01:24:17.051 --> 01:24:18.653
BETTER CIRCUMSTANCES AS HELPFUL

01:24:18.720 --> 01:24:19.854
A LOT OF SUBSTANCE ABUSE IS

01:24:19.921 --> 01:24:21.890
ACTUALLY DEVELOPED OVER THE

01:24:21.956 --> 01:24:23.758
DEEPER CALAMITY FOR IT IS.

01:24:23.825 --> 01:24:27.729
EARLY IN AGE -- SO WHERE DOES IT

01:24:27.796 --> 01:24:28.329
TELL YOU ANYTHING -- AS THEIR

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:29.364
CATCHER AND TAKING TO PROGRAMS

01:24:29.431 --> 01:24:30.031
AGAINST EACH OTHER READ THE AT

01:24:30.098 --> 01:24:31.433
THE AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAM OR

01:24:31.499 --> 01:24:33.134
SAYING WHAT ABOUT US.

01:24:33.201 --> 01:24:34.803
AND WE DON'T WANT TO THROW.

01:24:34.869 --> 01:24:36.471
YOU KNOW THE A. P. AND CHILD

01:24:36.538 --> 01:24:37.138
CARE.

01:24:37.205 --> 01:24:39.140
FAMILIES UNDER THE BUS AND SO WE

01:24:39.207 --> 01:24:41.276
REALLY ARE COUNTING ON ON THE

01:24:41.342 --> 01:24:43.978
BUDGET TO VALUE BOTH OF THESE.

01:24:44.045 --> 01:24:45.680
AND SO THAT'S THE DISAPPOINTING

01:24:45.747 --> 01:24:47.415
THING IS YOU KNOW WE WE'RE GONNA

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:47.916
HAVE TO BE.

01:24:47.982 --> 01:24:49.784
LOOKING AT THE BAD GUYS SOLUTION

01:24:49.851 --> 01:24:51.686
HERE AND CAN PICKING WINNERS AND

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:54.656
LOSERS WHEN -- I THINK THAT --

01:24:54.722 --> 01:24:56.591
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS

01:24:56.658 --> 01:24:58.460
CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT.

01:24:58.526 --> 01:25:03.998
PROP SIXTY FOUR TALK ABOUT AFTER

01:25:04.065 --> 01:25:05.033
SCHOOL PROGRAMS.

01:25:05.099 --> 01:25:06.835
THEY HAD ONE WORDS ON THE TV

01:25:06.901 --> 01:25:07.569
COMMERCIAL ONE SLOGAN.

01:25:07.635 --> 01:25:08.536
A ONE WORD AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS

01:25:08.603 --> 01:25:08.837
[inaudible]

01:25:08.903 --> 01:25:16.644
NOTHING ELSE -- OKAY

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:16.945
[inaudible]

01:25:17.011 --> 01:25:19.747
YES -- ONE MORE QUESTION FOR THE

01:25:19.814 --> 01:25:22.984
FOR THE LA -- SO YOUR REVENUE

01:25:23.051 --> 01:25:24.619
PROJECTIONS WERE A LITTLE BIT

01:25:24.686 --> 01:25:27.021
HIGHER THAN THE NUMBERS FROM THE

01:25:27.088 --> 01:25:29.224
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE.

01:25:29.290 --> 01:25:30.725
AND IN ORDER STANDING AT DOESN'T

01:25:30.792 --> 01:25:32.727
HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON

01:25:32.794 --> 01:25:35.463
SCHOOLS AND AND PROP NINETY

01:25:35.530 --> 01:25:36.097
EIGHT CAN YOU ELABORATE ON THAT

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:36.764
A LITTLE BIT.

01:25:36.831 --> 01:25:38.733
SURE I'LL DO MY BEST I THINK

01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:40.401
THERE MIGHT BE YOU KNOW WE'RE

01:25:40.468 --> 01:25:41.836
WE'RE STILL KIND OF WORKING WITH.

01:25:41.903 --> 01:25:42.871
THE ADMINISTRATION AND WE

01:25:42.937 --> 01:25:44.472
THINKING ABOUT THE DIFFERENCES

01:25:44.539 --> 01:25:46.040
AND WHY THEY ARE BUT I THINK ONE

01:25:46.107 --> 01:25:49.110
FACTOR IS THAT WE WE PREPARE OUR

01:25:49.177 --> 01:25:50.278
ESTIMATES A LITTLE BIT LATER

01:25:50.345 --> 01:25:51.746
THAN THE ADMINISTRATION SO WE

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.348
HAVE A LITTLE BIT BETTER DATA

01:25:53.414 --> 01:25:54.782
MORE RECENT DATA ON WHAT

01:25:54.849 --> 01:25:56.150
HAPPENED IN APRIL IN SOME OF THE

01:25:56.217 --> 01:25:56.351
MORE.

01:25:56.417 --> 01:25:59.153
RECENT I TAX COLLECTIONS AND WE

01:25:59.220 --> 01:25:59.721
CAN INCORPORATE THAT IN OUR

01:25:59.787 --> 01:26:00.455
OUTLOOK.

01:26:00.522 --> 01:26:02.423
WE ALSO I THINK ANOTHER FACTOR

01:26:02.490 --> 01:26:04.392
IS -- ALL THESE INITIAL PUBLIC

01:26:04.459 --> 01:26:05.827
OFFERINGS OF CALIFORNIA BASED

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:07.362
COMPANIES IT'S A PRETTY

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:09.230
SIGNIFICANT KIND OF REVENUE BUMP

01:26:09.297 --> 01:26:11.099
FROM THAT WE JUST HAVE DIFFERENT

01:26:11.165 --> 01:26:12.734
WAYS OF MODELING AT I THINK OUR

01:26:12.800 --> 01:26:13.268
IS.

01:26:13.334 --> 01:26:14.969
KIND OF MODEL ASSUMES A LITTLE

01:26:15.036 --> 01:26:16.304
BIT MORE SLIGHTLY MORE REVENUE

01:26:16.371 --> 01:26:21.309
FROM THOSE KINDS OF OFFERINGS --

01:26:21.376 --> 01:26:22.176
SO WE'RE STILL KIND OF WORKING

01:26:22.243 --> 01:26:23.278
TO MAKE SURE WE UNDERSTAND ALL

01:26:23.344 --> 01:26:24.212
OF THE PIECES -- BUT WE THINK

01:26:24.279 --> 01:26:26.180
THOSE TWO ARE PART OF IT AND IN

01:26:26.247 --> 01:26:27.949
KIND OF THE BROADER ECONOMIC

01:26:28.016 --> 01:26:29.551
OUTLOOK WE ARE VERY SIMILAR -- I

01:26:29.617 --> 01:26:31.619
THINK FOR LIKE THE REVENUE THAT

01:26:31.686 --> 01:26:33.655
AFFECTS PROPOSITION.

01:26:33.721 --> 01:26:34.188
NINETY EIGHT OR MAYBE TWO

01:26:34.255 --> 01:26:34.822
HUNDRED MILLION.

01:26:34.889 --> 01:26:38.059
BELOW THE ADMINISTRATION AND

01:26:38.126 --> 01:26:38.693
SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN FOUR HUNDRED

01:26:38.760 --> 01:26:42.730
MILLION PER YEAR ABOVE THEM AND

01:26:42.797 --> 01:26:43.264
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN NINETEEN

01:26:43.331 --> 01:26:44.432
TWENTY YOU KNOW THE CONTEXT OF A

01:26:44.499 --> 01:26:45.833
HUNDRED AND FORTY BILLION IN

01:26:45.900 --> 01:26:47.468
GENERAL FUND REVENUE THAT'S

01:26:47.535 --> 01:26:48.603
THAT'S ABOUT AS CLOSE AS YOU'RE

01:26:48.670 --> 01:26:50.638
LIKELY TO SEE IN A IN TWO

01:26:50.705 --> 01:26:52.907
DIFFERENT OUTLOOKS.

01:26:52.974 --> 01:26:53.508
OKAY THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:26:53.575 --> 01:26:55.476
LIMA.

01:26:55.543 --> 01:26:57.078
I THINK I JUST WANTED TO CHIME

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.546
IN -- AS THE VICE CHAIR OF THE

01:26:58.613 --> 01:27:00.214
WOMEN'S CAUCUS ON THE

01:27:00.281 --> 01:27:01.482
CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE KIND OF

01:27:01.549 --> 01:27:02.550
PITTING.

01:27:02.617 --> 01:27:05.453
OF EARLY CHILDHOOD CARE US LOTS

01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:07.589
WITH AFTER SCHOOL SLOTS -- AND

01:27:07.655 --> 01:27:08.690
WHILE.

01:27:08.756 --> 01:27:11.092
I THINK THAT THE THERE HAS BEEN

01:27:11.159 --> 01:27:13.861
JUSTIFICATION MADE THAT LEGALLY

01:27:13.928 --> 01:27:15.997
THE BALLOT LANGUAGE ALLOWS FOR

01:27:16.064 --> 01:27:17.599
THAT I THINK THAT IT'S NOT IN

01:27:17.665 --> 01:27:20.935
THE SPIRIT OF WHAT OUR PARTNERS --

01:27:21.002 --> 01:27:22.604
NINE AND ALSO WHAT THE PUBLIC

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:24.372
THINKS AND SO I WOULD ASKS FOR

01:27:24.439 --> 01:27:26.608
RECONSIDERATION ON THAT FACT I

01:27:26.674 --> 01:27:27.342
GET IT.

01:27:27.408 --> 01:27:28.509
YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN PART OF

01:27:28.576 --> 01:27:30.244
BALLOT INITIATIVES AS WELL AND

01:27:30.311 --> 01:27:32.513
WE CAN LEGALLY JUSTIFY THEM BUT

01:27:32.580 --> 01:27:33.948
IN THE LAST TWENTY FOUR HOURS

01:27:34.015 --> 01:27:35.883
THE CONVERSATION WITH OUR

01:27:35.950 --> 01:27:38.319
PARTNERS IN BOTH -- EARLY

01:27:38.386 --> 01:27:40.555
CHILDHOOD AT CARE -- SPOTS AS

01:27:40.622 --> 01:27:43.925
WELL AS AFTER SCHOOL SPOTS HAS.

01:27:43.992 --> 01:27:46.928

01:27:46.995 --> 01:27:49.330
HEADING OF EACH OTHER -- AND I

01:27:49.397 --> 01:27:50.465
WOULD HOPE THAT.

01:27:50.531 --> 01:27:52.066
WE CAN FIND WAYS TO WORK

01:27:52.133 --> 01:27:52.867
TOGETHER AND MAKE THESE

01:27:52.934 --> 01:27:54.335
DECISIONS COLLECTIVELY BUT I

01:27:54.402 --> 01:27:55.303
HOPE THAT THAT MESSAGES

01:27:55.370 --> 01:27:57.872
UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR PARTNERS WHO

01:27:57.939 --> 01:28:00.475
GO OUT WITH US TO GET BALLOTS

01:28:00.541 --> 01:28:02.110
PASSED. TO MOVE INITIATIVES

01:28:02.176 --> 01:28:05.079
FORWARD TO FIND AND IDENTIFY --

01:28:05.146 --> 01:28:06.681
FUNDING -- SHOULDN'T BE PITTED

01:28:06.748 --> 01:28:07.915
AGAINST EACH OTHER IN A

01:28:07.982 --> 01:28:10.385
SITUATION LIKE THIS -- I THINK

01:28:10.451 --> 01:28:12.153

SO IN SUCH A WAY AND I GET IT

01:28:16.290 --> 01:28:17.625
LEGALLY WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE THE

01:28:17.692 --> 01:28:19.694
BALLOT INITIATIVES ARE PURPOSELY

01:28:19.761 --> 01:28:21.596

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:22.490
GOVERNOR COMFORTABLE WITH

REALLY HAVE A POSITION OUR

01:30:03.264 --> 01:30:03.731
COMMENT TO THAT QUESTION

01:30:03.798 --> 01:30:05.133

COST OF LIVING WHICH I THINK

01:30:34.762 --> 01:30:36.697
REFLECTS THE THE REALITY OF

01:30:36.764 --> 01:30:37.732
LIVING IN THE STATE OF

01:30:37.799 --> 01:30:40.835

DRAMATICALLY HIGHER PER PEOPLE

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.653

ESPECIALLY THOSE ON THE EAST

01:31:01.622 --> 01:31:03.324
COAST DOES THE GOVERNOR HAVE A

01:31:03.391 --> 01:31:06.627
PLAN ON HOW TO INCREASE

01:31:06.694 --> 01:31:09.463
CALIFORNIA'S PER PEOPLE SPENDING.

01:31:09.530 --> 01:31:10.765
I WOULDN'T SAY IT AT THIS POINT

01:31:10.832 --> 01:31:12.633
THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS A

01:31:12.700 --> 01:31:13.901
SPECIFIC PLAN IN TERMS OF YOU

01:31:13.968 --> 01:31:15.236

01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:19.640
CERTAINLY.

01:31:19.707 --> 01:31:20.875
PART OF THE CONVERSATION WE TALK

01:31:20.942 --> 01:31:22.143
