00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.928
I WANT TO BEGIN BY MAKING THREE

00:05:28.995 --> 00:05:29.896
POINTS ABOUT THE BUDGET TODAY.

00:05:29.962 --> 00:05:31.364
THE FIRST IS EXACTLY WHAT MADAM

00:05:31.431 --> 00:05:32.298
CHAIR MENTIONED AT THE START

00:05:32.365 --> 00:05:33.433
WHICH IS THAT THIS IS A BUDGET

00:05:33.499 --> 00:05:33.966
THAT IS BASED ON PHYSICAL%

00:05:34.033 --> 00:05:36.202
STRENGTH AND FISCAL RESILIENCY.

00:05:36.269 --> 00:05:37.136
WE UNDERSTAND THAT BUILDING THE

00:05:37.203 --> 00:05:37.804
SPACE OF FISCAL STRENGTH AS A

00:05:37.870 --> 00:05:39.172
PREDICATE FOR EXPANDING PROGRAMS

00:05:39.238 --> 00:05:40.139
AND MAKING THE INVESTMENT THAT

00:05:40.206 --> 00:05:41.641
WE WANT TO MAKE.

00:05:41.708 --> 00:05:42.208
IN THE GOVERNOR'S INAUGURAL

00:05:42.275 --> 00:05:42.742

WEAPONS.

00:05:46.479 --> 00:05:47.447
AND AS WE ALL KNOW A GOOD HOME

00:05:47.513 --> 00:05:49.148
BEGINS WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION

00:05:49.215 --> 00:05:50.283
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE BEGINNING

00:05:50.349 --> 00:05:51.584
WITH RESILIENCY AT THE VERY

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.152
START.

00:05:53.219 --> 00:05:54.353
THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO MAKE

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:55.955
ABOUT THIS BUDGET IS THAT IT IS

00:05:56.022 --> 00:05:57.457

00:05:59.459 --> 00:06:00.526
SOME OF THE POINTS THAT WERE

00:06:00.593 --> 00:06:02.228
MAKING SOME THE INVESTMENTS THAT

00:06:02.295 --> 00:06:03.896

00:06:11.938 --> 00:06:14.040

INVESTMENTS OVER A PERIOD OF

00:06:18.211 --> 00:06:18.911

00:06:33.526 --> 00:06:36.028
PATIENCE WE BELIEVE THAT LAYING

00:06:36.095 --> 00:06:37.764
DOWN THAT MARKER RIGHT NOW AND

00:06:37.830 --> 00:06:38.731
SAYING THIS IS WHAT WE WANT TO

00:06:38.798 --> 00:06:40.266
DO THIS IS WHAT WE'RE COMMITTED

00:06:40.333 --> 00:06:41.134
TO AND THIS IS HOW WE HOPE TO

00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.635
ACHIEVE IT.

00:06:42.702 --> 00:06:44.337
IS REALLY IMPORTANT.

00:06:44.403 --> 00:06:44.871
IT'S OFTEN SAID THAT WE

00:06:44.937 --> 00:06:45.671
OVERESTIMATE WHAT WE CAN

00:06:45.738 --> 00:06:47.106
ACCOMPLISH IN ONE YEAR OR TWO

00:06:47.173 --> 00:06:48.841
YEARS AND UNDERESTIMATE WHAT WE

00:06:48.908 --> 00:06:50.610
CAN ACCOMPLISH IN FIVE YEARS OR

00:06:50.676 --> 00:06:51.310
TEN YEARS.

00:06:51.377 --> 00:06:52.411
AND WE HOPE BY LAYING DOWN THESE

00:06:52.478 --> 00:06:53.813
MARKERS THE BUDGET COULD MOVE US

00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:55.815
IN THAT DIRECTION.

00:06:55.882 --> 00:06:57.150
THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IS

00:06:57.216 --> 00:06:58.117
THAT THIS IS THE GOVERNOR'S

00:06:58.184 --> 00:07:00.219
BUDGET PROPOSAL IT REFLECTS HIS

00:07:00.286 --> 00:07:01.454
PRIORITIES.

00:07:01.521 --> 00:07:02.588
BUT I HOPE YOU'LL ALSO FIND AT

00:07:02.655 --> 00:07:03.756
THE INITIAL PROPOSAL THAT IT

00:07:03.823 --> 00:07:05.158
REFLECTS SOME OF YOUR PRIORITIES

00:07:05.224 --> 00:07:06.592
AS WELL.

00:07:06.659 --> 00:07:07.760
AS SOME OF YOU KNOW --

00:07:07.827 --> 00:07:10.496
THE GOVERNOR HAS BEEN IN TOUCH.

00:07:10.563 --> 00:07:11.831
AT HIS PRESS CONFERENCE HE

00:07:11.898 --> 00:07:13.800
CALLED OUT SEVERAL YOU BY NAME

00:07:13.866 --> 00:07:14.934
IN TALKING ABOUT SOME HIS

00:07:15.001 --> 00:07:16.102
PROPOSALS.

00:07:16.169 --> 00:07:18.504
SO THAT'S A CONVERSATION THAT HE

00:07:18.571 --> 00:07:19.505
WANTS TO CONTINUE THAT ALL OF US

00:07:19.572 --> 00:07:20.940
IN THE ADMINISTRATION HOPE TO

00:07:21.007 --> 00:07:21.941
CONTINUE.

00:07:22.008 --> 00:07:23.142
AND AS YOU DISCUSS THIS BUDGET

00:07:23.209 --> 00:07:25.611
AS YOU DELIBERATE ON IT AS YOU

00:07:25.678 --> 00:07:26.179
SHAPE IT AS YOU AMENDED.

00:07:26.245 --> 00:07:27.313
WE HOPE THAT WE'LL BE ABLE TO

00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:28.214
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU TO

00:07:28.281 --> 00:07:29.482
MAKE SURE THAT THIS BUDGET

00:07:29.549 --> 00:07:31.450
REFLECTS BOTH HIS PRIORITIES AND

00:07:31.517 --> 00:07:33.019
YOURS.

00:07:33.085 --> 00:07:34.053
AND SO BEGINNING WITH AN

00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:36.789
OVERVIEW OF THE BUDGET WE'VE GOT

00:07:36.856 --> 00:07:37.390
ONE HUNDRED FORTY FOUR BILLION

00:07:37.456 --> 00:07:38.591
DOLLARS IN SPENDING IN OUR

00:07:38.658 --> 00:07:39.625
GENERAL FIND.

00:07:39.692 --> 00:07:40.960
OUT WHEN YOU ADD IN SPECIAL

00:07:41.027 --> 00:07:42.862
FUNDS AND BOND FUNDS THE TOTAL

00:07:42.929 --> 00:07:44.497
COMES TO TWO HUNDRED NINE

00:07:44.564 --> 00:07:46.365
BILLION DOLLARS WE HAVE WHAT THE

00:07:46.432 --> 00:07:47.433
GOVERNOR CALLED AN INTERESTING

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:49.635
SURPLUS OF TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE

00:07:49.702 --> 00:07:51.938
BILLION DOLLARS PROJECTED AT THE

00:07:52.004 --> 00:07:53.406
END OF THE COMING BUDGET YEAR.

00:07:53.472 --> 00:07:55.107
THAT'S A BIG SURPLUS WE ALSO

00:07:55.174 --> 00:07:56.843
KNOW FROM RECENT CALIFORNIA

00:07:56.909 --> 00:07:58.678
HISTORY THAT THE SURPLUS IS CAN

00:07:58.744 --> 00:07:59.612
BE EVANESCENT.

00:07:59.679 --> 00:08:01.347
THAT'S WHY IN THIS BUDGET WE

00:08:01.414 --> 00:08:03.282
HAVE A LARGE RATIO OF ONE TIME

00:08:03.349 --> 00:08:04.617
SPENDING COMPARED TO ONGOING

00:08:04.684 --> 00:08:07.253
SPENDING OVER 86% OF THE BUDGET

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:08.888
FROM THE SURPLUS IS ONE TIME

00:08:08.955 --> 00:08:09.622
SPENDING.

00:08:09.689 --> 00:08:11.424
LESS THAN 14% IS ON GOING

00:08:11.490 --> 00:08:13.726
SPENDING THAT MEANS FOR EVERY

00:08:13.793 --> 00:08:15.294
SIX DOLLARS IN ONE TIME SPENDING

00:08:15.361 --> 00:08:17.096
COMMITTED OUT OF THE SURPLUS WE

00:08:17.163 --> 00:08:18.598
SPEND JUST A DOLLAR FOR ON GOING

00:08:18.664 --> 00:08:19.832
SPENDING.

00:08:19.899 --> 00:08:20.933
AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.602
BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:08:22.668 --> 00:08:23.970
THAT THIS BUDGET IS NOT JUST

00:08:24.036 --> 00:08:25.471
BALANCE THIS YEAR AND AS WE ALL

00:08:25.538 --> 00:08:26.105
KNOW.

00:08:26.172 --> 00:08:26.806
UNDER THE CALIFORNIA

00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.774
CONSTITUTION WE HAVE TO SUBMIT A

00:08:28.841 --> 00:08:29.775
BALANCED BUDGET AND THE

00:08:29.842 --> 00:08:31.077
LEGISLATURE HAS TO ENACT.

00:08:31.143 --> 00:08:32.078
ONE BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE

00:08:32.144 --> 00:08:33.646
SURE THAT THE BUDGET IS BALANCED

00:08:33.713 --> 00:08:34.981
OVER THE FORECAST PERIOD WHICH

00:08:35.047 --> 00:08:37.183
UNDER PROPOSITION TWO IS THE

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:37.850
THREE YEARS FOLLOWING THE BUDGET

00:08:37.917 --> 00:08:38.818
YEAR.

00:08:38.885 --> 00:08:40.686
SO IN OUR PROJECTIONS THE BUDGET

00:08:40.753 --> 00:08:42.622
WE PROPOSED SHOWS A POSITIVE

00:08:42.688 --> 00:08:44.090
OPERATING SURPLUS THAT MEANS

00:08:44.156 --> 00:08:45.524
REVENUES IN THAT YEAR AND

00:08:45.591 --> 00:08:46.926
EXPENDITURES IN THAT YEAR.

00:08:46.993 --> 00:08:51.764
NOT JUST FOR TWENTY NINETEEN AND

00:08:51.831 --> 00:08:52.265
TWENTY AND THAT'S REALLY

00:08:52.331 --> 00:08:53.733
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THIS IS A

00:08:53.799 --> 00:08:55.301
BUDGET ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE

00:08:55.368 --> 00:08:56.769
FACE GROWING RISKS.

00:08:56.836 --> 00:08:57.737
AS GOVERNOR BROWN OFTEN

00:08:57.803 --> 00:08:59.338
MENTIONED WE'RE APPROACHING THE

00:08:59.405 --> 00:09:01.040
LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION SINCE

00:09:01.107 --> 00:09:02.208
WORLD WAR.

00:09:02.275 --> 00:09:03.309
TWO THE STOCK MARKET BOTTOMED

00:09:03.376 --> 00:09:04.977
OUT IN THE SPRING OF TWO

00:09:05.044 --> 00:09:06.512
THOUSAND NINE SO TEN YEARS.

00:09:06.579 --> 00:09:08.447
FROM NOW WILL BE THIS SUMMER AND

00:09:08.514 --> 00:09:09.982
THAT MATCH THE EXPANSION THAT WE

00:09:10.049 --> 00:09:12.184
SAW BETWEEN NINETEEN NINETY ONE

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:13.920
AND TWO THOUSAND ONE WHEN THE

00:09:13.986 --> 00:09:14.854
DOT COM CRASH HAPPENED.

00:09:14.921 --> 00:09:16.722
AND SO WE DON'T KNOW WHEN THIS

00:09:16.789 --> 00:09:18.257
EXPANSION IS GOING TO AND

00:09:18.324 --> 00:09:19.625
THERE'S A FAMOUS SAYING AMONG

00:09:19.692 --> 00:09:20.760
ECONOMISTS THAT.

00:09:20.826 --> 00:09:22.828
THEY PREDICT NINE OUT OF THE

00:09:22.895 --> 00:09:23.562
LAST FIVE RECESSIONS.

00:09:23.629 --> 00:09:25.765
BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT --

00:09:25.831 --> 00:09:27.500
WHAT CANNOT GO ON INDEFINITELY

00:09:27.566 --> 00:09:28.935
AT SOME POINT WILL COME TO A

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.670
STOP AND WE HAVE TO BE PREPARED

00:09:30.736 --> 00:09:32.471
FOR THAT?

00:09:32.538 --> 00:09:33.639
WE SING DIZZYING VOLATILITY IN

00:09:33.706 --> 00:09:34.907
THE STOCK MARKET BUT THE S. AND

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:36.242
P. FIVE HUNDRED WITHIN THE

00:09:36.309 --> 00:09:38.077
BEGINNINGS OF A POSSIBLE TRADE

00:09:38.144 --> 00:09:39.178
WAR WITH CHINA --

00:09:39.245 --> 00:09:40.813
WE HAVE A SHUTDOWN OF THE

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:42.081
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT --

00:09:42.148 --> 00:09:43.749
AND WE'VE A WHITE HOUSE THAT CAN

00:09:43.816 --> 00:09:44.650
OFTEN BE UNPREDICTABLE.

00:09:44.717 --> 00:09:45.918
AND SO WHEN YOU PUT ALL THESE

00:09:45.985 --> 00:09:47.820
THINGS TOGETHER THERE'S A LOT TO

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:50.489
WATCH OUT FOR AND OUR DEPARTMENT

00:09:50.556 --> 00:09:52.725
HAS MODELED A RECESSION SCENARIO

00:09:52.792 --> 00:09:54.493
TO SEE HOW OUR BUDGET WOULD

00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:55.928
WHETHER RECESSION.

00:09:55.995 --> 00:09:57.430
THERE A RECESSION SOONER THAT

00:09:57.496 --> 00:09:58.631
THEY MODELS --

00:09:58.698 --> 00:09:59.799
HAS A RECESSION THAT IS LESS

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:00.700
SEVERE THAN THE RECESSION THAT

00:10:00.766 --> 00:10:02.802
HAPPENED IN TWO THOUSAND AND TWO

00:10:02.868 --> 00:10:03.302
THOUSAND NINE THE GREAT

00:10:03.369 --> 00:10:04.704
RECESSION BUT MORE SEVERE THAN

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.206
THE RECESSION THAT HAPPENED AT

00:10:07.273 --> 00:10:07.807
TWO THOUSAND ONE AT THE END OF

00:10:07.873 --> 00:10:08.674
THE DOT COM CRASH.

00:10:08.741 --> 00:10:10.609
AND UNDER THAT MODEL WE FOUND

00:10:10.676 --> 00:10:14.513
THAT THE FIVE BILLION DOLLARS --

00:10:14.580 --> 00:10:15.881
BEFORE ANY PROPOSITION NINETY

00:10:15.948 --> 00:10:17.350
EIGHT EIGHT ADJUSTMENT AFTER ONE

00:10:17.416 --> 00:10:18.217
YEAR.

00:10:18.284 --> 00:10:20.019
AND SIXTY SIX BILLION DOLLARS

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:21.487
AFTER THREE YEARS --

00:10:21.554 --> 00:10:23.389
SO THAT'S A BIG GAP THAT WE HAVE

00:10:23.456 --> 00:10:24.523
TO BE MINDFUL LOGIC THAT

00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.092
RECESSION COMES OUR WAY.

00:10:26.158 --> 00:10:27.460
AND EVEN WITHOUT A RECESSION

00:10:27.526 --> 00:10:28.728
WE'RE FORECASTING SLOWING

00:10:28.794 --> 00:10:30.496
REVENUE GROWTH ABOUT THREE POINT

00:10:30.563 --> 00:10:32.231
2% ANNUALIZED OVER THE FORECAST

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:33.466
PERIOD.

00:10:33.532 --> 00:10:34.633
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE WANT

00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:36.235
TO BE READY FOR AS WELL.

00:10:36.302 --> 00:10:37.036
AND THAT'S WHY AS THE CHAIR

00:10:37.103 --> 00:10:38.437
MENTIONED WE'RE STARTING WIH

00:10:38.504 --> 00:10:40.940
RESILIENCY THIS BUDGET INCLUDES

00:10:41.007 --> 00:10:41.841
TEN BILLION DOLLARS FROM THE

00:10:41.907 --> 00:10:43.809
SURPLUS AND RESILIENCY

00:10:43.876 --> 00:10:44.143
INVESTMENTS.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:45.511
IN DIGITAL THREE POINT SIX

00:10:45.578 --> 00:10:47.513
BILLION DOLLARS FROM PROPOSITION

00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:48.881
TWO PAYMENTS TO FURTHER BUILD

00:10:48.948 --> 00:10:50.516
RESILIENCY.

00:10:50.583 --> 00:10:51.183
AND LET ME GO TO REACH THOSE IN

00:10:51.250 --> 00:10:52.218
TURN.

00:10:52.284 --> 00:10:53.719
THE FIRST FOUR BILLION DOLLARS

00:10:53.786 --> 00:10:55.488
IS TO PAY OFF BUDGETARY JACKSON

00:10:55.554 --> 00:10:56.856
DEFERRALS AS MANY OF YOU

00:10:56.922 --> 00:10:58.391
REMEMBER WHEN GOVERNOR BROWN

00:10:58.457 --> 00:11:00.426
CAME INTO OFFICE HE POINTED TO

00:11:00.493 --> 00:11:01.694
WHAT HE FAMOUSLY CALLED THE WALL

00:11:01.761 --> 00:11:02.128
OF TAX.

00:11:02.194 --> 00:11:04.330
MORE THAN THIRTY BILLION DOLLARS

00:11:04.397 --> 00:11:05.364
IN BUDGETARY AND RELATED DEBTS.

00:11:05.431 --> 00:11:06.799
THEY'RE STILL OVER TWO BILLION

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.567
DOLLARS OF THAT JACK REMAINING

00:11:08.634 --> 00:11:10.069
AT THE START THIS BUDGET PERIOD.

00:11:10.136 --> 00:11:10.903
THIS BUDGET --

00:11:10.970 --> 00:11:13.873
PROPOSES TO PAY THOSE BUDGETARY

00:11:13.939 --> 00:11:14.707
DEBTS ARE --

00:11:14.774 --> 00:11:17.176
WHEN AND GOVERNOR'S WERE TRYING

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:18.411
TO DO --

00:11:18.477 --> 00:11:20.713
THEY USE.

00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:23.916
WHAT SOME CALL SOME KLAY PUSH A

00:11:23.983 --> 00:11:25.551
PAYMENT INTO THE FOLLOWING

00:11:25.618 --> 00:11:27.019
FISCAL YEAR FOR THAT PAYMENT IS

00:11:27.086 --> 00:11:29.388
STILL THE STATE HAS TO MAKE IT

00:11:29.455 --> 00:11:30.056
BUT IT WASN'T REFLECTED IN THAT

00:11:30.122 --> 00:11:30.856
YEAR?

00:11:30.923 --> 00:11:32.491
THIS BUDGET PROPOSES TO REVERSE

00:11:32.558 --> 00:11:35.027
AND DOES ONE PAYMENT TO CALPERS

00:11:35.094 --> 00:11:36.462
OF SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

00:11:36.529 --> 00:11:37.997
AND ANOTHER A PAYROLL TO FOR ALL

00:11:38.064 --> 00:11:39.565
OF ONE BILLION DOLLARS AND WE'RE

00:11:39.632 --> 00:11:41.133
HOPING BY MAKING THOSE PAYMENTS

00:11:41.200 --> 00:11:42.301
WHEN THEIR SCHEDULE WHEN WE'RE

00:11:42.368 --> 00:11:43.269
SCHEDULE TO MAKE THEM.

00:11:43.335 --> 00:11:44.804
WE CAN FURTHER BUILD RESILIENCY

00:11:44.870 --> 00:11:48.207
AND GET OUR BUDGET ON TRACK.

00:11:48.274 --> 00:11:49.008
THE SECOND THING THIS BUDGET

00:11:49.075 --> 00:11:50.476
DOES IN THE RESILIENCY

00:11:50.543 --> 00:11:51.577
DEPARTMENT IS BILLS RESERVES.

00:11:51.644 --> 00:11:52.978
IT PUTS TWO POINT THREE BILLION

00:11:53.045 --> 00:11:54.480
DOLLARS SINCE THE SPECIAL FINE

00:11:54.547 --> 00:11:56.449
FOR ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTIES AND

00:11:56.515 --> 00:11:57.650
THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:11:57.716 --> 00:11:58.784
THAT'S THE FUN THAT THE DIRECTOR

00:11:58.851 --> 00:11:59.785
OF FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR

00:11:59.852 --> 00:12:01.554
ACCESS IN EMERGENCIES.

00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:02.955
INCLUDING THE RECENT WILDFIRES

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:04.757
THAT WE SAW IN CALIFORNIA IN

00:12:04.824 --> 00:12:06.292
NOVEMBER.

00:12:06.358 --> 00:12:07.393
IT ALSO PUT SEVEN HUNDRED

00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:08.794
MILLION DOLLARS INTO THE SAFETY

00:12:08.861 --> 00:12:10.262
NET RESERVE WHICH I KNOW THE

00:12:10.329 --> 00:12:11.363
CHAIR PLAYED A KEY ROLE IN

00:12:11.430 --> 00:12:13.065
THINKING ABOUT CREATING.

00:12:13.132 --> 00:12:14.300
THIS IS A FINE THAT MAKES SURE

00:12:14.366 --> 00:12:15.868
THAT IN A DOWNTURN WE CAN

00:12:15.935 --> 00:12:17.937
PROTECT OUR MEDI CAL AND CAL

00:12:18.003 --> 00:12:19.438
WORKS PROGRAMS WHICH HELP OUR

00:12:19.505 --> 00:12:21.340
MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS.

00:12:21.407 --> 00:12:22.975
AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE THAT FUND

00:12:23.042 --> 00:12:24.777
CURRENTLY HAS A BALANCE OF TWO

00:12:24.844 --> 00:12:26.245
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS WE'RE

00:12:26.312 --> 00:12:28.380
PROPOSING TO MORE THAN QUADRUPLE

00:12:28.447 --> 00:12:28.981
EIGHT TO NINE HUNDRED MILLION

00:12:29.048 --> 00:12:30.282
DOLLARS.

00:12:30.349 --> 00:12:31.183
THE LAST THING WE DO FOR ON THE

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.118
RESERVE FRONT IS MAKE AN

00:12:32.184 --> 00:12:33.519
ADDITIONAL ONE POINT EIGHT

00:12:33.586 --> 00:12:35.488
BILLION DOLLAR DEPOSIT INTO THE

00:12:35.554 --> 00:12:36.889
BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT.

00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.190
OFTEN KNOWN AS THE RAINY DAY

00:12:38.257 --> 00:12:39.859
FUND AND ONE NOTE THAT I WANT TO

00:12:39.925 --> 00:12:41.861
MAKE HERE IS THAT INITIALLY

00:12:41.927 --> 00:12:43.229
UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN'S LAST

00:12:43.295 --> 00:12:43.796
BUDGET.

00:12:43.863 --> 00:12:45.564
THIS WAS FORECASTED TO REACH ITS

00:12:45.631 --> 00:12:47.666
10% CONSTITUTIONAL CAP UNDER

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.301
PROPOSITION.

00:12:49.368 --> 00:12:50.169
TWO HOWEVER --

00:12:50.236 --> 00:12:51.137
WE RECEIVED OF LEGISLATIVE

00:12:51.203 --> 00:12:52.805
COUNSEL OPINION WHICH THE

00:12:52.872 --> 00:12:54.240
ADMINISTRATION CONCURS WITH

00:12:54.306 --> 00:12:55.741
WHICH BELIEVES THAT THE ONLY

00:12:55.808 --> 00:12:57.977
PAYMENTS THAT APPLY TO THAT 10%

00:12:58.043 --> 00:13:00.146
CAP OR MANDATORY DEPOSITS UNDER

00:13:00.212 --> 00:13:01.514
PROPOSITION.

00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:03.115
TWO BECAUSE ONLY PAYMENTS ARE

00:13:03.182 --> 00:13:06.418
PER SHOULD BE GOVERNED BY ITS

00:13:06.485 --> 00:13:08.787
RESTRICTIONS SO EVEN THOUGH --

00:13:08.854 --> 00:13:10.289
THAT BALANCE OF THE FUND ILL BE

00:13:10.356 --> 00:13:12.124
MORE THAN 10% OF GENERAL FUND

00:13:12.191 --> 00:13:13.292
REVENUES AT THE END OF THIS

00:13:13.359 --> 00:13:14.860
BUDGET YEAR WE BELIEVE THAT

00:13:14.927 --> 00:13:16.395
UNDER LAW WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

00:13:16.462 --> 00:13:18.063
CONTINUE PUTTING MONEY INTO THE

00:13:18.130 --> 00:13:19.165
RAINY DAY FUND.

00:13:19.231 --> 00:13:20.399
SO THAT IT WILL REACH FIFTEEN

00:13:20.466 --> 00:13:21.767
POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS AT

00:13:21.834 --> 00:13:23.435
THE END OF THIS YEAR UP FROM

00:13:23.502 --> 00:13:24.203
THIRTEEN POINT FIVE BILLION

00:13:24.270 --> 00:13:24.904
DOLLARS.

00:13:24.970 --> 00:13:26.272
AND BY THE END OF THE FORECAST

00:13:26.338 --> 00:13:28.007
PERIOD IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY

00:13:28.073 --> 00:13:29.008
THREE IT WILL APPROACH TWENTY

00:13:29.074 --> 00:13:30.509
BILLION DOLLARS AND THAT WILL BE

00:13:30.576 --> 00:13:32.111
A REAL IMPORTANT BUFFER IN THE

00:13:32.178 --> 00:13:33.646
YEARS AHEAD.

00:13:33.712 --> 00:13:35.014
THE FINAL THING THAT THIS BUDGET

00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:37.349
DOES ON THE WERE ON THE PHYSICAL

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:38.551
RESILIENCY FRONT IS MAKE IT BIG

00:13:38.617 --> 00:13:39.685
PAY DOWN.

00:13:39.752 --> 00:13:42.321
OUR RETIREE LIABILITIES AS ALL

00:13:42.388 --> 00:13:43.889
OF YOU KNOW WE HAVE A LARGE

00:13:43.956 --> 00:13:45.157
UNFUNDED LIABILITY.

00:13:45.224 --> 00:13:46.525
AND THE GOVERNOR WANTS TO MAKE A

00:13:46.592 --> 00:13:47.993
PRIORITY TO ADDRESS THAT NOT

00:13:48.060 --> 00:13:49.495
SIMPLY BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT

00:13:49.562 --> 00:13:50.429
THING TO DO --

00:13:50.496 --> 00:13:51.730
NOT SIMPLY BECAUSE IT HELPS US

00:13:51.797 --> 00:13:52.765
MEET OUR PROMISES TO OUR

00:13:52.831 --> 00:13:54.800
RETIREES BUT ALSO BECAUSE OF

00:13:54.867 --> 00:13:56.535
RESULTS IN BIG SAVINGS DOWN THE

00:13:56.602 --> 00:13:57.069
ROAD.

00:13:57.136 --> 00:13:58.337
THE THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:13:58.404 --> 00:13:59.438
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO THE

00:13:59.505 --> 00:14:00.673
CALPERS SYSTEM THAT WE ARE

00:14:00.739 --> 00:14:02.374
PROPOSING WILL RESULT IN SEVEN

00:14:02.441 --> 00:14:04.510
POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN

00:14:04.577 --> 00:14:05.110
SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT THIRTY

00:14:05.177 --> 00:14:05.844
YEARS.

00:14:05.911 --> 00:14:07.079
THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION

00:14:07.146 --> 00:14:08.647
DOLLARS AND CAL STAR IS PAYMENTS

00:14:08.714 --> 00:14:10.049
THAT WE'RE PROPOSING ON BEHALF

00:14:10.115 --> 00:14:10.916
OF THE STATE.

00:14:10.983 --> 00:14:12.384
COMBINED WITH THE PROJECTED ONE

00:14:12.451 --> 00:14:13.819
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS OVER

00:14:13.886 --> 00:14:15.487
THE FORECAST PERIOD WILL RESULT

00:14:15.554 --> 00:14:16.989
IN SEVEN POINT FOUR BILLION

00:14:17.056 --> 00:14:19.091
DOLLARS IN SAVINGS OVER THE NEXT

00:14:19.158 --> 00:14:20.159
THIRTY YEARS.

00:14:20.226 --> 00:14:21.627
WE ALSO PROPOSE CONTINUING WITH

00:14:21.694 --> 00:14:23.662

ON THE LOAN FROM OUR SPECIAL

00:14:28.801 --> 00:14:30.402
FUNDS THAT WAS USED TO MAKE A

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:33.138
SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT TO CALPERS.

00:14:33.205 --> 00:14:34.373
TWO YEARS AGO.

00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:36.375
IN ALL OF THESE AS WE WERE AS WE

00:14:36.442 --> 00:14:36.942
KNOW WE'RE RELYING ON

00:14:37.009 --> 00:14:38.277
PROJECTIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO

00:14:38.344 --> 00:14:39.678
UPDATE THESE NUMBERS THROUGH MAY

00:14:39.745 --> 00:14:40.946
AND JUNE AND IN THE MONTHS TO

00:14:41.013 --> 00:14:42.581
COME.

00:14:42.648 --> 00:14:43.882
WHEN WE GET TO THE IMPORTANT

00:14:43.949 --> 00:14:45.284
BOARD SPENDING PRIORITIES THAT

00:14:45.351 --> 00:14:46.719
THE CHAIR TALKED ABOUT --

00:14:46.785 --> 00:14:47.620
I WANT TO BEGIN AT THE BEGINNING

00:14:47.686 --> 00:14:49.088
WITH EARLY CHILDHOOD WHICH IS

00:14:49.154 --> 00:14:51.624
SUCH A PRIORITY FOR THE GOVERNOR

00:14:51.690 --> 00:14:52.725
AND I KNOW FOR SO MANY OF YOU.

00:14:52.791 --> 00:14:54.193
THIS BUDGET BEGINS WITH A

00:14:54.260 --> 00:14:55.961
LOOKING FOR UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL

00:14:56.028 --> 00:14:58.831
FOR ALL ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIA --

00:14:58.897 --> 00:15:00.499
FOUR YEAR OLDS ON AN ELIGIBLE

00:15:00.566 --> 00:15:02.901
MEANS FAMILIES THAT ARE FROM 85%

00:15:02.968 --> 00:15:04.136
OR BELOW A MEDIAN INCOME.

00:15:04.203 --> 00:15:07.740
THIS BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:08.540
TWENTY FIVE IN GENERAL FUND

00:15:08.607 --> 00:15:09.508
FUNDING THAT'S OUTSIDE OF

00:15:09.575 --> 00:15:11.710
PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT TO ADD

00:15:11.777 --> 00:15:13.078
ADDITIONAL SLOTS.

00:15:13.145 --> 00:15:14.146
AND WE HOPE TO GET OUT OVER THE

00:15:14.213 --> 00:15:16.215
NEXT THREE YEARS TO TWO HUNDRED

00:15:16.282 --> 00:15:16.849
THOUSAND SLOTS SO THAT WE CAN

00:15:16.915 --> 00:15:17.549
ACHIEVE THAT TARGET AND

00:15:17.616 --> 00:15:19.385
UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL. FOR ALL

00:15:19.451 --> 00:15:21.153
ELIGIBLE FOUR YEAR OLDS WERE

00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:22.254
ALSO WE ALSO PROPOSED

00:15:22.321 --> 00:15:23.422
ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT THAT

00:15:23.489 --> 00:15:25.057
APPEAR IN IS WORKING OR IN

00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.659
SCHOOL IN ORDER FOR THEIR

00:15:26.725 --> 00:15:28.193
OTHERWISE ELIGIBLE CHILD. TO BE

00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.029
ABLE TO ACCESS THIS PRESCHOOL

00:15:30.095 --> 00:15:30.963
PROGRAM.

00:15:31.030 --> 00:15:32.998
WE ALSO KNOW THAT MORE THAN 20%

00:15:33.065 --> 00:15:34.733
OF DISTRICTS DO NOT OFFER FULLY

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:36.702
FULL DAY KINDERGARTEN AND WE

00:15:36.769 --> 00:15:38.404
KNOW THAT'S A SPENDING ISSUE BUT

00:15:38.470 --> 00:15:40.072
THAT'S ALSO A CAPACITY AND

00:15:40.139 --> 00:15:40.906
FACILITY ISSUE.

00:15:40.973 --> 00:15:43.042
SO THIS BUDGET PROPOSES AGAIN

00:15:43.108 --> 00:15:45.411
ONE TIME SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

00:15:45.477 --> 00:15:45.911
NINE DOLLARS TO INCREASE

00:15:45.978 --> 00:15:48.113
CAPACITY AND RETROFIT SOME OF

00:15:48.180 --> 00:15:49.515
OUR CLASSROOMS IN OUR SCHOOL SO

00:15:49.581 --> 00:15:50.282
THAT THEIR ADOPTABLE FOR FULL

00:15:50.349 --> 00:15:51.650
DAY KINDERGARTEN.

00:15:51.717 --> 00:15:53.719
AND MORE FAMILIES CAN SEND THEIR

00:15:53.786 --> 00:15:55.521
KIDS.

00:15:55.587 --> 00:15:56.088
HE ALSO PROPOSED A SIMILAR

00:15:56.155 --> 00:15:57.189
INVESTMENT FOR FIVE HUNDRED

00:15:57.256 --> 00:15:58.257
MILLION DOLLARS IN CHILD CARE

00:15:58.324 --> 00:15:59.758
FACILITIES AND THAT ALSO

00:15:59.825 --> 00:16:01.794
IMPROVES TRAINING UP THE CHILD

00:16:01.860 --> 00:16:02.895
CARE WORK FORCE BECAUSE WITHOUT

00:16:02.961 --> 00:16:04.063
CHILD CARE IS A BIG REASON WHY

00:16:04.129 --> 00:16:05.230
FAMILIES ARE FEELING SUCH A

00:16:05.297 --> 00:16:06.932
SQUEEZE IN THIS ECONOMY.

00:16:06.999 --> 00:16:08.100
AND WE WANT TO GET STARTED ON

00:16:08.167 --> 00:16:10.135
THE PATH TO ADDRESS THAT WE ALSO

00:16:10.202 --> 00:16:11.070
INCLUDE --

00:16:11.136 --> 00:16:12.237
FOR THIS CALIFORNIA STATE

00:16:12.304 --> 00:16:14.673
UNIVERSITY WHERE MANY STUDENTS

00:16:14.740 --> 00:16:16.942
WHO ARE ALSO PERRANCE ATTENDS UP

00:16:17.009 --> 00:16:17.476
TO TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN

00:16:17.543 --> 00:16:18.344
MILLION DOLLARS WHICH GOES FOR

00:16:18.410 --> 00:16:19.845
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BUT A LOT

00:16:19.912 --> 00:16:21.580
OF THAT MONEY CAN ALSO GO TO

00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:22.214
CHILD CARE --

00:16:22.281 --> 00:16:23.482
FOR FACILITIES AND OTHER CHILD

00:16:23.549 --> 00:16:24.817
CARE PROGRAMS.

00:16:24.883 --> 00:16:26.352
AND FINALLY WITH ALL OF THESE

00:16:26.418 --> 00:16:28.020
THE GUYS MENTION THE GOVERNOR

00:16:28.087 --> 00:16:28.887
HAS LAID OUT A BOLD AGENDA BUT

00:16:28.954 --> 00:16:30.422
WE KNOW THAT IT CAN ONLY BE

00:16:30.489 --> 00:16:31.256
ACHIEVED AND STOPS.

00:16:31.323 --> 00:16:32.691
SO WE'RE PROPOSING TEN MILLION

00:16:32.758 --> 00:16:34.159
DOLLARS TO REALLY GET UNDER THE

00:16:34.226 --> 00:16:35.894
HOOD AND SEE WHAT IT WOULD TAKE

00:16:35.961 --> 00:16:38.230
TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL PRESCHOOL

00:16:38.297 --> 00:16:38.764
FOR ALL FAMILIES NOT JUST

00:16:38.831 --> 00:16:39.732
ELIGIBLE.

00:16:39.798 --> 00:16:42.000
UNIVERSAL CHILD CARE --

00:16:42.067 --> 00:16:45.704
FULL DAY TO ACHIEVE THOSE SO WE

00:16:45.771 --> 00:16:46.905
HOPE THAT THAT TEN MILLION

00:16:46.972 --> 00:16:48.640
DOLLAR STUDY WILL RESULT IN

00:16:48.707 --> 00:16:50.175
ROBUST REVENUE OPTIONS --

00:16:50.242 --> 00:16:52.144
PROGRAM OPTIONS AND THINGS THAT

00:16:52.211 --> 00:16:53.746
WE CAN PURSUE.

00:16:53.812 --> 00:16:54.380
IN THE MONTHS AND YEARS DOWN THE

00:16:54.446 --> 00:16:55.748
ROAD.

00:16:55.814 --> 00:16:56.815
I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT CAL

00:16:56.882 --> 00:16:58.517
WORKS BECAUSE THIS IS ONE OF THE

00:16:58.584 --> 00:17:00.252
BIGGEST ONGOING SPENDING

00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:02.821
COMMITMENTS AND THIS BUDGET --

00:17:02.888 --> 00:17:05.991
WE PROPOSE INCREASING UP 250% OF

00:17:06.058 --> 00:17:07.359
FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THE

00:17:07.426 --> 00:17:08.927
MAXIMUM GRANT THAT MEANS FOR A

00:17:08.994 --> 00:17:11.430
FAMILY OF THREE IN WHICH ALL

00:17:11.497 --> 00:17:12.064
THREE INDIVIDUALS ARE RECEIVING

00:17:12.131 --> 00:17:12.898
ASSISTANCE.

00:17:12.965 --> 00:17:14.933
THAT GRANT WOULD GO TO EIGHT

00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:15.968
HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT DOLLARS --

00:17:16.034 --> 00:17:17.269
AND THAT'S A BIG COMMITMENT AS I

00:17:17.336 --> 00:17:18.537
MENTIONED IN THIS BUDGET YEAR

00:17:18.604 --> 00:17:20.806
WERE FORECASTING THREE HUNDRED

00:17:20.873 --> 00:17:21.507
FORTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION

00:17:21.573 --> 00:17:22.808
DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND.

00:17:22.875 --> 00:17:24.309
THAT WILL GROW TO NEARLY HALF A

00:17:24.376 --> 00:17:26.278
BILLION DOLLARS IN YEARS TO COME.

00:17:26.345 --> 00:17:27.913
BUT WE THINK THAT'S REALLY

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.881
IMPORTANT AND THE GOVERNOR

00:17:28.947 --> 00:17:30.149
POINTED TO DIE IN HIS PRESS

00:17:30.215 --> 00:17:31.950
CONFERENCE HOW THIS IS A CORE

00:17:32.017 --> 00:17:34.119
COMMITMENT OF HIS ADMINISTRATION

00:17:34.186 --> 00:17:34.720
AND A CORE RESPONSIBILITY OF

00:17:34.787 --> 00:17:35.554
GOVERNMENT.

00:17:35.621 --> 00:17:36.922
WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE

00:17:36.989 --> 00:17:39.124
INCREASING IT 250% OF FEDERAL

00:17:39.191 --> 00:17:40.392
POVERTY LEVEL IN OUR PROPOSAL

00:17:40.459 --> 00:17:41.627
BUT WE ALSO ANTICIPATE FURTHER

00:17:41.693 --> 00:17:43.262
GROWTH THROUGH THE STRUCTURE OF

00:17:43.328 --> 00:17:44.797
REALIGNMENT AND THE CHILD

00:17:44.863 --> 00:17:45.497
POVERTY SUB ACCOUNT.

00:17:45.564 --> 00:17:48.167
SO THAT GRANT WILL CONTINUE TO

00:17:48.233 --> 00:17:49.601
GROW IN THE YEARS TO COME.

00:17:49.668 --> 00:17:50.536
WE ALSO PROPOSE MORE MONEY FOR

00:17:50.602 --> 00:17:52.671
LOCAL CHILD SUPPORT AGENCIES

00:17:52.738 --> 00:17:53.605
NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION

00:17:53.672 --> 00:17:54.907
DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUNDS.

00:17:54.973 --> 00:17:56.041
AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:17:56.108 --> 00:17:57.676
ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE COUNTIES

00:17:57.743 --> 00:17:59.111
THAT ARE LOWER INCOME --

00:17:59.178 --> 00:18:00.179
TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN

00:18:00.245 --> 00:18:01.580
ENFORCE CHILD SUPPORT LAWS AND

00:18:01.647 --> 00:18:02.915
REGULATIONS AND THAT SHOULD

00:18:02.981 --> 00:18:04.249
RESULT IN HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS

00:18:04.316 --> 00:18:05.117
OF DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

00:18:05.184 --> 00:18:06.185
PAYMENTS.

00:18:06.251 --> 00:18:07.820
THAT WILL GO DIRECTLY TO CARE

00:18:07.886 --> 00:18:09.288
IT'S OFTEN OUR MOST LOW INCOME

00:18:09.354 --> 00:18:10.556
NEEDIEST KIDS --

00:18:10.622 --> 00:18:12.124
AND THEN FINALLY I MADE A POINT

00:18:12.191 --> 00:18:13.525
ABOUT STUDENT PARENTS --

00:18:13.592 --> 00:18:15.160
THIS A BIG PRIORITY OF THIS

00:18:15.227 --> 00:18:17.930

A SMALL DEPOSIT ON BEHALF OF A

00:20:52.618 --> 00:20:54.987

SPECIAL EDUCATION IS AN AREA

00:23:44.055 --> 00:23:45.023
WHERE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

00:23:45.090 --> 00:23:46.324
COMMITTED TO COVERING A BIG

00:23:46.391 --> 00:23:47.592
SHARE.

00:23:47.659 --> 00:23:48.827

INCUMBENT ON THE STATE.

00:23:58.136 --> 00:23:59.638
AS MUCH AS WE MIGHT WISH THE

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:00.505
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WOULD HELP US

00:24:00.572 --> 00:24:01.907

00:24:07.646 --> 00:24:08.413
ADDITION AND THIS IS OUTSIDE

00:24:08.480 --> 00:24:10.015
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BUT N

RETIREMENT SYSTEM ON BEHALF OF

00:24:20.392 --> 00:24:21.593
SCHOOL DISTRICTS --

00:24:21.660 --> 00:24:22.861
THAT WE PROJECT WILL SAVE

00:24:22.928 --> 00:24:24.830
SCHOOLS THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:25.463
MILLION DOLLARS IN THIS BUDGET

00:24:25.530 --> 00:24:27.265
YEAR. THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

00:24:27.332 --> 00:24:28.733
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE FOLLOWING

00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:30.168
BUDGET YEAR AND THEN HUNDREDS OF

MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN THE YEARS

00:24:31.536 --> 00:24:33.004
AFTER THAT WE THINK THIS IS

00:24:33.071 --> 00:24:34.973
REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE WE KNOW

00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.341
EVEN WITH THESE BIG INCREASES.

00:24:36.408 --> 00:24:37.943
OUR SCHOOLS ARE UNDER A LOT OF

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:39.010
PRESSURE --

00:24:39.077 --> 00:24:40.612
THEIR PENSION PAYMENTS HAVE BEEN

00:24:40.679 --> 00:24:41.880
RISING FOR THE RETIRED TEETH FOR

WE KNOW THAT'S A LOT AND WE

00:24:50.789 --> 00:24:51.990
THINK THIS THREE BILLION DOLLARS

00:24:52.057 --> 00:24:53.124
WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN

00:24:53.191 --> 00:24:53.959
HELPING THEM.

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.595
MANAGE THOSE COSTS. THREE OTHER

00:24:56.661 --> 00:24:57.662
FINAL POINTS I WANT TO MAKE ON

00:24:57.729 --> 00:24:59.164
K. TWELVE FIRST IS THAT THE

00:24:59.231 --> 00:25:00.732
GOVERNOR CAN TUNING ON A

00:25:00.799 --> 00:25:02.000
PRIORITY THAT HE MENTIONED IN

00:25:02.067 --> 00:25:02.801
HIS CAMPAIGN.

00:25:02.868 --> 00:25:03.702
IS COMMITTING TEN MILLION

00:25:03.768 --> 00:25:06.104
DOLLARS TO A LONGITUDINAL DATA --

00:25:06.171 --> 00:25:07.405
PROGRAM AND THIS AGAIN IS THE

00:25:07.472 --> 00:25:08.974
FIRST STEP IT WILL TAKE A COUPLE

00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:10.075
OF YEARS TO IMPLEMENT.

00:25:10.141 --> 00:25:11.076
BUT IT'S DESIGNED TO MAKE SURE

00:25:11.142 --> 00:25:12.844
THAT WE KNOW HOW OUR KIDS ARE

00:25:12.911 --> 00:25:14.646
DOING FROM CRADLE ALL THE WAY

00:25:14.713 --> 00:25:15.914
THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL THROUGH POST

00:25:15.981 --> 00:25:17.949
SECONDARY EDUCATION AND CAREER

00:25:18.016 --> 00:25:18.750
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE

00:25:18.817 --> 00:25:20.051
DELIVERING ON WHAT.

00:25:20.118 --> 00:25:21.720
WE'RE PROMISING THEM AND ALSO TO

00:25:22.888 --> 00:25:24.356
LEARNING IN SCHOOL AND HOW WE'RE

00:25:24.422 --> 00:25:25.457
EDUCATING OUR STUDENTS IS

00:25:25.523 --> 00:25:26.524
ALIGNED WITH THE NEEDS OF

00:25:26.591 --> 00:25:27.926
CALIFORNIA'S WORK FORCE. TO

00:25:27.993 --> 00:25:29.160
THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HOPE TO

00:25:29.227 --> 00:25:30.629
WORK WITH YOU ON AND DEVELOPING

00:25:30.695 --> 00:25:33.064
THAT SYSTEM AND MAKING SURE IT'S

00:25:33.131 --> 00:25:34.432
SERVING OUR STUDENTS.

00:25:34.499 --> 00:25:35.800
A SECOND POINT IN THIS BUDGET IS

00:25:35.867 --> 00:25:36.501
WE'RE PROPOSING TO MAKE SOME

00:25:36.568 --> 00:25:37.702
AMENDMENTS TO THE CERTIFICATION

FLEXIBILITY IN FUTURE YEARS AND

00:25:46.177 --> 00:25:47.379
I'M HAPPY TO GO INTO SOME DETAIL

00:25:47.445 --> 00:25:48.947
ABOUT THAT IF ANYONE HAS ANY

00:25:49.014 --> 00:25:50.081
QUESTIONS.

00:25:50.148 --> 00:25:51.850
THE FINAL POINT THAT ONE THING

00:25:51.917 --> 00:25:52.450
THAT THE GOVERNOR HEARD A LOT

00:25:52.517 --> 00:25:54.119
BOTH IN HIS CAMPAIGN AND DURING

SOME SENSE THAT THAT MONEY IS

00:26:04.462 --> 00:26:05.797
NOT GETTING OUT THE DOOR TO

00:26:05.864 --> 00:26:07.499

FOR THEM.

00:30:58.957 --> 00:30:59.624
ALSO STRENGTHENING THE

00:31:07.498 --> 00:31:08.399
AS THE STATE MOVES TOWARD BULK

00:31:08.466 --> 00:31:09.534
PURCHASING AND AS MEDI CAL IN

00:31:09.601 --> 00:31:11.336
PARTICULAR TRANSFORMS FROM

00:31:16.174 --> 00:31:17.542
IN OUR BUDGET HOWEVER WE

00:31:17.609 --> 00:31:18.943
UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DETAILS OF

00:31:19.010 --> 00:31:20.111
THIS ARE BEING WORKED OUT AND

00:31:20.178 --> 00:31:22.046
WE'RE NOT PROJECTING ANY SAVINGS

00:31:22.113 --> 00:31:24.148
UNTIL THE OUT YEAR IN TWENTY ONE

00:31:24.215 --> 00:31:24.682
TWENTY TWO THAT'S WHEN WE

00:31:24.749 --> 00:31:25.416
BELIEVE.

00:31:25.483 --> 00:31:28.152
THAT THE SAVINGS WILL ACTUALLY

00:31:28.219 --> 00:31:30.855
KICK IN FOR OUR STATE REINSTATE

00:31:30.922 --> 00:31:32.357
THE MANDATE THAT HAS LAPSED AT

00:31:32.423 --> 00:31:33.925
THE FEDERAL LEVEL --

00:31:33.992 --> 00:31:35.460
FOR THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND

00:31:35.526 --> 00:31:36.728
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE

00:31:36.794 --> 00:31:39.163
THIS IS WHAT KEEPS THE UNINSURED

00:31:39.230 --> 00:31:40.198
RATE LOW --

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.533
PROJECTIONS HAVE SUGGESTED THAT

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:43.635
IF WE DO NOT TAKE THE STATUS OF

00:31:43.701 --> 00:31:44.669
THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED IN THE

00:31:44.736 --> 00:31:46.437
STATE CAN INCREASED BY ALMOST A

00:31:46.504 --> 00:31:47.805
MILLION PEOPLE --

00:31:47.872 --> 00:31:48.940
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE TED THAT

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:50.642
THAT PENALTY CAN KEEP OUR

00:31:50.708 --> 00:31:52.076
HISTORICALLY LOW UNINSURED RATE

00:31:52.143 --> 00:31:54.012
WHERE IT IS --

00:31:54.078 --> 00:31:54.846
AND ANY SO ANY --

00:31:54.912 --> 00:31:56.581
PENALTY REVENUE THAT COMES FROM

00:31:56.648 --> 00:31:58.116
THAT NEW MANDATE WE WILL USE

00:31:58.182 --> 00:31:59.684
THAT TO PUT RIGHT BACK INTO THE

00:31:59.751 --> 00:32:01.052

00:32:14.966 --> 00:32:15.500
THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

00:32:15.566 --> 00:32:16.934
FAMILIES THAT ARE PURCHASING.

00:32:17.001 --> 00:32:18.736
INSURANCE ON THE EXCHANGES WE

PEOPLE IN THIS YEAR.

00:32:23.975 --> 00:32:25.076
IT'S A HUNDRED POINT SEVEN

00:32:25.143 --> 00:32:26.911
BILLION DOLLAR PROGRAM THAT'S

00:32:26.978 --> 00:32:27.512
TWENTY TWO POINT NINE BILLION

00:32:27.578 --> 00:32:29.847
DOLLARS IN OUR GENERAL FUND AND

00:32:29.914 --> 00:32:31.115
WE MAKE A NUMBER OF ADJUSTMENTS

00:32:31.182 --> 00:32:32.183
HERE --

00:32:32.250 --> 00:32:33.151
UNDER PROP FIFTY SIX WERE

00:32:33.217 --> 00:32:34.752
DEVOTING MORE OF THAT MONEY TO

00:32:34.819 --> 00:32:36.187
RATE INCREASES FOR PROVIDERS

00:32:36.254 --> 00:32:37.488
THAT MORE FOR MEDI CAL PATIENTS

00:32:37.555 --> 00:32:39.090
CAN ACTUALLY GET A CHANCE TO SEE

00:32:39.157 --> 00:32:40.391
THE PROVIDERS WHOM THEY ARE

00:32:40.458 --> 00:32:41.926
ELIGIBLE TO SEE --

00:32:41.993 --> 00:32:43.161
WE'RE FORECASTING SOME

00:32:43.227 --> 00:32:44.495
MODERATION IN THE GROWTH OF

00:32:44.562 --> 00:32:46.264
MEDICARE HOW OUR CASE LOAD HAS

00:32:46.331 --> 00:32:47.465
MODERATED SOME OF OUR COSTS

00:32:47.532 --> 00:32:48.466
DECLINED --

00:32:48.533 --> 00:32:50.335
COMPARED TO WHAT WE PROJECTED --

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:52.103
AND ALSO --

00:32:52.170 --> 00:32:52.737
THERE WERE SOME RECONCILIATIONS

00:32:52.804 --> 00:32:55.740
INTER THE TIMING OF THE HOSPITAL

00:32:55.807 --> 00:32:57.442
QUALITY INSURANCE FEE AND THAT

00:32:57.508 --> 00:32:58.910
ACCOUNTS GOING BACK TO THE VERY

00:32:58.976 --> 00:33:00.712
BEGINNING FOR PART OF THAT

00:33:00.778 --> 00:33:02.213
NATURE SURPLUS OF TWENTY ONE AND

00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:03.414
A HALF BILLION DOLLARS THAT

00:33:03.481 --> 00:33:05.550
WE'RE PROJECTING FOR THIS YEAR.

00:33:05.616 --> 00:33:06.617
ONE OTHER MAJOR POINT ABOUT MEDI

00:33:06.684 --> 00:33:07.752
CAL WHICH THE GOVERNOR NOW

00:33:07.819 --> 00:33:09.520
ANNOUNCED JUST AS HE WAS COMING

00:33:09.587 --> 00:33:10.054
INTO OFFICE IS THAT WE'RE

00:33:10.121 --> 00:33:12.223

TWENTY SIX AS YOU ALL KNOW WE

00:33:20.031 --> 00:33:22.100

BETWEEN BIRTH AND AGE EIGHTEEN

00:33:25.370 --> 00:33:26.437
SO THIS WOULD EXTEND THAT

00:33:26.504 --> 00:33:27.438
THROUGH AGE.

00:33:27.505 --> 00:33:29.307
TWENTY FIVE WERE PROJECTING ONE

00:33:29.374 --> 00:33:29.907
HUNDRED NINETY SIX POINT FIVE

MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND

00:33:31.609 --> 00:33:33.978
FOR THAT PROGRAM HOWEVER BECAUSE

00:33:34.045 --> 00:33:35.313
PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW INSURED UNDER

00:33:35.380 --> 00:33:36.914
THAT PROGRAMS WILL NOT NEED TO

00:33:36.981 --> 00:33:38.483
ACCESS AS MANY COUNTY MEDICAL

00:33:38.549 --> 00:33:39.984

NINE CHECKING THAT ABOUT SEVENTY

00:34:48.719 --> 00:34:50.121
MILLION DOLLARS WILL BE THEIR

00:34:54.625 --> 00:34:56.861
HSS CHANGES RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.696
LIKE CAL WORKS THIS IS A BIG

00:34:58.763 --> 00:35:00.465
ONGOING COMMITMENT FROM OUR

OVERALL SURPLUS THAT WILL BE

00:35:03.167 --> 00:35:03.734
THAT WE'RE FORECASTING INTO THE

00:35:03.801 --> 00:35:05.636
YEARS TO COME.

00:35:05.703 --> 00:35:06.537
I HSS SERVES OVER HALF A MILLION

00:35:06.604 --> 00:35:07.905
PEOPLE IN THE STATE AND HELPS

00:35:07.972 --> 00:35:09.841
THEM WITH DOMESTIC AND PERSONAL

00:35:09.907 --> 00:35:11.409
CARE SERVICES THAT THEY CANNOT

00:35:11.476 --> 00:35:13.077
PERFORM ADEQUATELY ON THEIR OWN.

00:35:13.144 --> 00:35:15.112
AND WE'RE PROPOSING TO BIG --

00:35:15.179 --> 00:35:17.181
CHANGES THE FIRST IS A REVISION

00:35:17.248 --> 00:35:18.049
TO THE COUNTY MAINTENANCE OF

00:35:18.115 --> 00:35:18.883
EFFORT --

00:35:18.950 --> 00:35:21.853
THAT WAS AGREED UPON IN --

00:35:21.919 --> 00:35:22.453
TWENTY SEVENTEEN WE UNDERSTAND

00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:23.554
THAT COUNTIES ARE FACING GROWING

00:35:23.621 --> 00:35:24.956
COST COMPARED TO WHAT WAS

00:35:25.022 --> 00:35:26.591
INITIALLY PROJECTED INCLUDING

00:35:26.657 --> 00:35:27.525
FOR SOME INCREASES IN THE

00:35:27.592 --> 00:35:28.826
MINIMUM WAGE AS WELL AS OTHER

00:35:28.893 --> 00:35:31.329
POLICY CHANGES AT BOTH THE STATE.

00:35:31.395 --> 00:35:32.830
AND THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO WE'RE

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:34.966
PROPOSING TO REDUCE THAT AMMO WE

00:35:35.032 --> 00:35:36.067
FOR THE CURRENT YEAR --

00:35:36.133 --> 00:35:37.435
AND THEN CHANGE THE INFLATION

00:35:37.502 --> 00:35:40.137
FACTOR 24% IN COMING YEARS ON

00:35:40.204 --> 00:35:41.806
AND THEN AS A RESULT OF THAT

00:35:41.873 --> 00:35:43.908
REDUCED AND WE COUNTIES CAN

00:35:43.975 --> 00:35:45.243
REDIRECT SOME THAT FUNDING.

00:35:45.309 --> 00:35:46.911
BACK TO COUNTY INDIGENT HEALTH

00:35:46.978 --> 00:35:47.678
AND MENTAL HEALTH AS I WAS

00:35:47.745 --> 00:35:48.946
DISCUSSING --

00:35:49.013 --> 00:35:50.348
SAID THIS IS A BIG COST --

00:35:50.414 --> 00:35:51.249
WE'RE PROJECTING IN THE CURRENT

00:35:51.315 --> 00:35:53.284
YEAR TWO HUNDRED FORTY ONE POINT

00:35:53.351 --> 00:35:54.852
SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT

00:35:54.919 --> 00:35:57.121
WILL RISE TO FOUR HUNDRED SIXTY

00:35:57.188 --> 00:35:58.055
MILLION DOLLARS.

00:35:58.122 --> 00:36:00.391
IN THE OUT YEARS.

00:36:00.458 --> 00:36:03.728
THE SECOND THING THAT WERE DUE

00:36:03.794 --> 00:36:05.663
IN PERCENT CUT TO AYE HSS

00:36:05.730 --> 00:36:06.964
SERVICE HOURS THAT WAS DESIGNED

00:36:07.031 --> 00:36:07.532
TO GOING TO PLACE WITH THE

00:36:07.598 --> 00:36:09.433
EXPIRATION OF THE MANAGED CARE

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:11.602
ORGANIZATION TAX ALSO KNOWN AS

00:36:11.669 --> 00:36:12.670
THE MCO TAX.

00:36:12.737 --> 00:36:14.005
ON THE SET TO TAKE A FACT AND BY

00:36:14.071 --> 00:36:15.439
RESTORING THAT FUNDING WE'RE

00:36:15.506 --> 00:36:17.241
PROJECTING THREE HUNDRED FORTY

00:36:17.308 --> 00:36:17.808
TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

00:36:17.875 --> 00:36:18.876
CURRENT BUDGET YEAR.

00:36:18.943 --> 00:36:21.546
RISING TO OVER FOUR HUNDRED

00:36:21.612 --> 00:36:22.179
SEVENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN THE

00:36:22.246 --> 00:36:23.447
YEAR SO WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE OUT

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:24.215
YEARS BOTH THESE PROGRAMS YOU'RE

00:36:24.282 --> 00:36:25.750
LOOKING AT MORE THAN FOUR

00:36:25.816 --> 00:36:26.384
HUNDRED MILLIONDOLLARS IN EACH

00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:27.184
OF THEM.

00:36:27.251 --> 00:36:28.419
BUT WE THINK THAT IT'S REALLY

00:36:28.486 --> 00:36:29.754
IMPORTANT BECAUSE NUMBER ONE

00:36:29.820 --> 00:36:31.255
THIS IS A CORE RESPONSIBILITY OF

00:36:31.322 --> 00:36:32.156
THE STATE --

00:36:32.223 --> 00:36:32.790
WHEN WE'RE REALIGNING

00:36:32.857 --> 00:36:34.659
RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE TO MAKE

00:36:34.725 --> 00:36:35.560
SURE THAT THE FUNDING IS THERE

00:36:35.626 --> 00:36:37.161
TO PAY FOR THEM AND SECOND MANY

00:36:37.228 --> 00:36:38.663
OF YOU HAVE SERVED AND LOCAL

00:36:38.729 --> 00:36:39.764
GOVERNMENT YOU UNDERSTAND THE

00:36:39.830 --> 00:36:41.365
REVENUE PRESSURES THAT LOCAL

00:36:41.432 --> 00:36:42.300
GOVERNMENTS COUNTIES?

00:36:42.366 --> 00:36:43.768
SPACE AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE

00:36:43.834 --> 00:36:45.703
THAT THEY HAVE THE FREEDOM AND

00:36:45.770 --> 00:36:47.038
THEY HAVE THE FUNDS TO DO ALL

00:36:47.104 --> 00:36:48.005
THE OTHER THINGS THAT THEY NEED

00:36:48.072 --> 00:36:48.539
TO DO.

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:49.774
SO WE THINK THIS IS A BETTER

00:36:49.840 --> 00:36:52.310
AGREEMENT AND WE BELIEVE THAT

00:36:52.376 --> 00:36:55.546
THE STATE CAN AND SHOULD PICK

00:36:55.613 --> 00:36:57.782
THIS UP FROM THE GENERAL FUND.

00:36:57.848 --> 00:36:59.050
SO ON THAT AND CO TAX --

00:36:59.116 --> 00:37:00.518
IT'S PROJECTED TO EXPIRE THIS

00:37:00.585 --> 00:37:00.785
SUMMER --

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:01.986
AND I KNOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE

00:37:02.053 --> 00:37:02.720
QUESTIONS ABOUT IT --

00:37:02.787 --> 00:37:03.654
IN THINKING ABOUT DESCRIBING HOW

00:37:03.721 --> 00:37:05.423
THIS TAX FUNCTIONS I ALWAYS GO

00:37:05.489 --> 00:37:06.123
BACK -- TO

00:37:06.190 --> 00:37:06.991
QUOTATION --

00:37:07.058 --> 00:37:08.125
THAT GOVERNOR JERRY BROWN --

00:37:08.192 --> 00:37:11.162
SAID WHEN YOU.

00:37:11.228 --> 00:37:12.363
VERY FEW PEOPLE UNDERSTAND IT SO

00:37:12.430 --> 00:37:13.364
I'M NOT GOING TO TRY TO EXPLAIN

00:37:13.431 --> 00:37:15.199
IT TO YOU BECAUSE I COULDN'T

00:37:15.266 --> 00:37:17.068
EXPLAIN IT TO YOU IF I WANTED --

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:18.769
TO BUT THE TRUTH IS A LONG STORY

00:37:18.836 --> 00:37:20.972
SHORT THIS IS A TAX --

00:37:21.038 --> 00:37:22.106
NETWORKS WERE NUMBER MECHANISMS

00:37:22.173 --> 00:37:23.741
THAT DRAWS DOWN ADDITIONAL

00:37:23.808 --> 00:37:25.509
FEDERAL DOLLARS ANSWER THE

00:37:25.576 --> 00:37:27.511
QUESTION WE'VE RECEIVED A NOTICE

00:37:27.578 --> 00:37:28.479
WILL BE PART OF A DISCUSSION.

00:37:28.546 --> 00:37:30.481
ON WHY HAVE WE NOT INCLUDED THIS

00:37:30.548 --> 00:37:31.949
IN OUR JANUARY BUDGET PROPOSAL

00:37:32.016 --> 00:37:33.451
AND I THINK THE REASON IS TWO

00:37:33.517 --> 00:37:34.285
FOLD FIRST OF ALL WE WERE

00:37:34.352 --> 00:37:35.653
PUTTING THIS TOGETHER IN

00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:36.988
NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER.

00:37:37.054 --> 00:37:38.289
ON IT SO WE WERE THINKING ABOUT

00:37:38.356 --> 00:37:40.024
WHAT CAN WE COUNT ON WHEN IT

00:37:40.091 --> 00:37:41.659
COMES TO WHAT'S IN OUR BUDGET

00:37:41.726 --> 00:37:43.260
AND WHAT THE REVENUES ARE.

00:37:43.327 --> 00:37:44.629
AND SECOND WE BELIEVE THAT THERE

00:37:44.695 --> 00:37:45.997
WILL BE CONTINUED FEDERAL

00:37:46.063 --> 00:37:47.598
UNCERTAINTY IN TERMS OF

00:37:47.665 --> 00:37:48.566
OBVIOUSLY THE SHUT DOWN IS GOING

00:37:48.633 --> 00:37:50.001
ON BUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

00:37:50.067 --> 00:37:51.969
ALSO HAS TWO BIG WAIVERS THAT

00:37:52.036 --> 00:37:54.071
ARE COMING UP FOR RENEGOTIATION

00:37:54.138 --> 00:37:54.805
THE NEXT YEAR.

00:37:54.872 --> 00:37:56.507
THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER ON

00:37:56.574 --> 00:37:57.842
MEDI CAL FOR A MEDICAID PROGRAM

00:37:57.908 --> 00:37:58.909
THE CURRENT VALUE OF THAT IS

00:37:58.976 --> 00:38:00.544
OVER SIX BILLION DOLLARS OVER

00:38:00.611 --> 00:38:01.579
FIVE YEARS.

00:38:01.646 --> 00:38:03.080
AND WE ALSO HAVE IN NINETEEN

00:38:03.147 --> 00:38:04.448
FIFTEEN BE WAIVER ON BEHAVIORAL

00:38:04.515 --> 00:38:05.983
HEALTH AND THAT SEVERAL BILLION

00:38:06.050 --> 00:38:07.551
DOLLARS AND SO WE WANT TO MAKE

00:38:07.618 --> 00:38:08.653
SURE YOU KNOW IT'S A TOP

00:38:08.719 --> 00:38:10.287
PRIORITY OF OURS. TO GET THOSE

00:38:10.354 --> 00:38:11.455
WAIVERS RENEGOTIATED AND MAKE

00:38:11.522 --> 00:38:12.823
SURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S AND A

00:38:12.890 --> 00:38:14.091
GOOD PLACE SO GIVEN THE

00:38:14.158 --> 00:38:15.726
UNCERTAINTY AROUND THOSE WAIVERS --

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:19.530
WE DIDN'T WANT TO PUT SOMETHING

00:38:19.597 --> 00:38:21.499
ELSE IN THERE RIGHT NOW. ONE

00:38:21.565 --> 00:38:22.700
LAST POINT ON THIS --

00:38:22.767 --> 00:38:25.836
IS ON SSI AND S. S. P. PROGRAM --

00:38:25.903 --> 00:38:26.437
THE CHANGE --

00:38:26.504 --> 00:38:27.638
THAT WAS MADE LAST YEAR TO

00:38:27.705 --> 00:38:28.239
ELIMINATE THE CASH OUT POLICY

00:38:28.305 --> 00:38:30.508
THAT PREVENT.

00:38:30.574 --> 00:38:32.510
CALPERS BENEFITS ON THAT WAS

00:38:32.576 --> 00:38:34.378
CHANGED ON A ONE TIME BASIS --

00:38:34.445 --> 00:38:35.746
WE PROPOSE CHANGING THAT ON AN

00:38:35.813 --> 00:38:37.481
ONGOING BASIS MAKING SURE PEOPLE

00:38:37.548 --> 00:38:39.417
CAN ACCESS THEIR BENEFITS AND

00:38:39.483 --> 00:38:41.085
ANYBODY WHO UNDER THE FORMULA

00:38:41.152 --> 00:38:42.520
MIGHT HAVE RECEIVED REDUCED

00:38:42.586 --> 00:38:44.622
ACCESS TO THESE BENEFITS WOULD

00:38:44.689 --> 00:38:45.923
BE HELD HARMLESS AND CONTINUE AT

00:38:45.990 --> 00:38:47.258
THE SAME LEVEL THAT THEY WERE

00:38:47.324 --> 00:38:47.558
ACCESSING.

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:48.659
BEFORE.

00:38:48.726 --> 00:38:49.860
FINAL POINT IN THE HEALTHCARE

00:38:49.927 --> 00:38:50.928
SIDE -- IS

00:38:50.995 --> 00:38:52.329
ON IMMIGRATION WHICH A LOT OF

00:38:52.396 --> 00:38:53.998
THE FUNDING FLOWS THROUGH THE

00:38:54.065 --> 00:38:55.199
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES --

00:38:55.266 --> 00:38:56.567
WE HAD SEVENTY FIVE MILLION

00:38:56.634 --> 00:38:57.702
DOLLARS IN THE LAST BUDGET YEAR

00:38:57.768 --> 00:38:59.203
WE'RE PROPOSING TO CONTINUE THAT

00:38:59.270 --> 00:39:00.504
ON AN ONGOING BASIS.

00:39:00.571 --> 00:39:02.273
BUT WERE ALSO PROPOSING TWENTY

00:39:02.339 --> 00:39:03.607
FIVE MILLION DOLLARS FOR A RAPID

00:39:03.674 --> 00:39:05.609
RESPONSE FINE TO RESPOND TO

00:39:05.676 --> 00:39:07.545
EMERGENCIES WHEREVER THEY CALM

WE KNOW THAT IN CALIFORNIA THERE

00:40:13.544 --> 00:40:15.713
OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND PEOPLE

00:40:15.780 --> 00:40:16.313
WHO ARE HOMELESS IN OUR STATE

00:40:16.380 --> 00:40:17.047
RIGHT NOW.

00:40:17.114 --> 00:40:18.349
ON AND WE KNOW THAT MORE MONEY

00:40:18.415 --> 00:40:19.884
IS REALLY IMPORTANT BUT IT WILL

00:40:19.950 --> 00:40:21.385
NEVER BE THE SOLUTION BY ITSELF

00:40:21.452 --> 00:40:23.320
SO WE NEED MONEY COMBINED WITH

00:40:23.387 --> 00:40:24.855
STRONG APPROACHES THAT CAN HELP

00:40:24.922 --> 00:40:26.023

AND ALL THIS FUNDING A HUNDRED

00:40:34.298 --> 00:40:35.766
MILLION DOLLARS WOULD GO TO THE

00:40:35.833 --> 00:40:36.333
THIRTEEN BIGGEST CITIES IN

00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:37.234

THE FORTY THREE CONTINUUM'S OF

00:40:50.247 --> 00:40:51.982
CARE THESE ARE AREAS DESIGNATED

00:40:52.049 --> 00:40:53.484
BY THE FEDERAL DEPARTMENT OF

AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT --

00:40:55.152 --> 00:40:56.620
AND THE KEY THING THAT WE WILL

00:40:56.687 --> 00:40:58.055
BE LOOKING FOR IN DESIGNING AND

00:40:58.122 --> 00:40:59.857
GIVING OUT THIS FINDING IS THAT

00:40:59.924 --> 00:41:01.292
THE SOLUTIONS ARE REGIONAL THEM

00:41:01.358 --> 00:41:02.326
AS ALL OF YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.627
BEFORE HE WAS GOVERNOR BEFORE HE

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:05.529
WAS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR --

00:41:05.596 --> 00:41:06.764
SERVED AS MAYOR AND THAT THE

HEAD OF BOTH THE CITY AND ON THE

00:41:08.065 --> 00:41:09.633
COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SO

00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:11.168
HE REALLY CATS AND UNDERSTANDS

00:41:11.235 --> 00:41:12.736
HOW THE SOLUTIONS HAVE TO BE

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.205
REACHED ON NATURE.

00:41:14.271 --> 00:41:16.507
SO THAT WILL BE A CORE PRIORITY.

00:41:16.574 --> 00:41:17.341
ONE OTHER POINT TO MAKE ABOUT

00:41:17.408 --> 00:41:17.842
THIS FUNDING --

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:20.811

BE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT THEY

CAN THEY CAN USE FOR ANY PURPOSE

00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:30.554
THAT THE WEST.

00:41:30.621 --> 00:41:31.755
AND THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT AT

00:41:31.822 --> 00:41:33.023
A TIME WHEN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.658
ARE ALWAYS START FOR FUNDS THAT

00:41:34.725 --> 00:41:35.626
THEY SEE THAT IF THEY DO THE

00:41:35.693 --> 00:41:36.961
RIGHT THING ON HOMELESSNESS AND

00:41:37.027 --> 00:41:38.162
IF THEY WORK WITH LOCAL

00:41:38.229 --> 00:41:39.129
JURISDICTIONS.

00:41:39.196 --> 00:41:40.631
THEY CAN ACESS THIS TWO HUNDRED

00:41:40.698 --> 00:41:41.932
MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL

00:41:41.999 --> 00:41:43.000

CENTERS --

00:41:50.407 --> 00:41:51.675
WITH THE OPERATING THEORY BEING

00:41:51.742 --> 00:41:52.910
IF WE CAN DO IT FOR A SPORTS

00:41:52.977 --> 00:41:54.712
STADIUM HOW WE CAN DO IT TO MAKE

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:56.347
SURE THAT PEOPLE ON THE STREETS

00:41:56.413 --> 00:41:58.015

SINCE THE BUDGET IN PRIOR YEARS

00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.768

00:42:17.835 --> 00:42:19.003
TO MAKE SURE IT'S THERE.

00:42:19.069 --> 00:42:20.738
YEAR AFTER YEAR AND THE LAST

00:42:20.804 --> 00:42:22.006
POINT I'LL MAKE ON HOMELESSNESS

00:42:22.072 --> 00:42:23.941
IS THAT WE'RE PROPOSING A

00:42:24.008 --> 00:42:25.776

00:42:39.456 --> 00:42:40.724
WAYS TO DO THAT.

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:41.392
I ALSO WANT TO TALK ABOUT

00:42:41.458 --> 00:42:42.326
HOUSING BECAUSE WHEN YOU THINK

00:42:42.393 --> 00:42:43.360
ABOUT THE PRIORITIES OF THIS

00:42:43.427 --> 00:42:45.362
ADMINISTRATION --

00:42:45.429 --> 00:42:46.563
AT THE TOP IS YOU KNOW AS

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:47.598

WHOM THAT DREAM IS OUT OF REACH.

00:42:51.669 --> 00:42:53.470
THE REASON AREAS HOUSING COSTS

00:42:53.537 --> 00:42:54.805
AND WE KNOW UNDER THE

00:42:54.872 --> 00:42:56.106
SUPPLEMENTAL POVERTY MEASURE

00:42:56.173 --> 00:42:57.808
NEARLY ONE IN FIVE FAMILIES IN

00:42:57.875 --> 00:42:59.510
CALIFORNIA FALLS UNDER THAT

00:42:59.576 --> 00:43:00.644
POVERTY MEASURE AND A MAJOR

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:02.079
REASON FOR THAT.

00:43:02.146 --> 00:43:03.580
IS HOUSING COSTS AND RUN BURDEN

00:43:03.647 --> 00:43:05.549
FAMILIES SO WE'RE PROPOSING A

00:43:05.616 --> 00:43:08.018
NUMBER OF DIFFERENT INITIATIVES --

00:43:08.085 --> 00:43:08.619
FIRST WE KNOW THAT OUTSIDE OF

00:43:08.686 --> 00:43:11.388
OUR BY THE FOUR BILLION DOLLAR

00:43:11.455 --> 00:43:13.123
BONDS THAT WAS APPROVED LAST

00:43:13.190 --> 00:43:14.258
YEAR THAT INCLUDES ONE AND A

00:43:14.325 --> 00:43:15.659
HALF BILLION DOLLARS FOR MULTI

00:43:15.726 --> 00:43:16.694
FAMILY HOUSING.

00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:17.895
AS WELL AS A BILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:43:17.962 --> 00:43:20.064
VETERANS AND THEN ALSO THE BOND

00:43:20.130 --> 00:43:20.864
THAT I MENTIONED THE NO PLACE

00:43:20.931 --> 00:43:22.700
LIKE HOME BOND WILL MAKE A

00:43:22.766 --> 00:43:23.600
DIFFERENCE ON THE HOUSING SIDE

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:24.234
AS WELL.

00:43:24.301 --> 00:43:26.003
AND THEN FINALLY TWO YEARS AGO

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:27.538
THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED IN THE

00:43:27.604 --> 00:43:29.006
GOVERNOR SIGNED A BILL PROVIDING

00:43:29.073 --> 00:43:30.741
A PERMANENT SOURCE OF FUNDING

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.942
FOR HOUSING REVENUES FROM REAL

00:43:32.009 --> 00:43:33.544
ESTATE TRANSACTION FEES THAT'S A

00:43:33.610 --> 00:43:35.279
COUPLE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A

00:43:35.346 --> 00:43:36.280
YEAR.

00:43:36.347 --> 00:43:37.147
SO AND OUR AGENDA WE'RE

00:43:37.214 --> 00:43:38.248
PROPOSING A SHORT TERM

00:43:38.315 --> 00:43:39.783
INITIATIVE AND A LONGER TERM

00:43:39.850 --> 00:43:40.784
INITIATIVE.

00:43:40.851 --> 00:43:41.952
ON THE SHORT TERM WE'RE

00:43:42.019 --> 00:43:44.288
COMMITTED TO SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY

00:43:44.355 --> 00:43:45.289
NINE DOLLARS TO FLOW TO LOCAL

00:43:45.356 --> 00:43:47.858
JURISDICTIONS TWO HUNDRED FIFTY

00:43:47.925 --> 00:43:49.126
MILLION DOLLARS WILL HELP THEM.

00:43:49.193 --> 00:43:50.527
PLAN FOR INCREASING THEIR

00:43:50.594 --> 00:43:52.229
HOUSING SUPPLY THAT STAFFING

00:43:52.296 --> 00:43:52.730
THAT'S PLANNING THAT'S

00:43:52.796 --> 00:43:55.032
PERMITTING THAT'S REZONING AND

00:43:55.099 --> 00:43:56.633
IF THEY HIT THE MILESTONES THAT

00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.002
WE WORK WITH THEM TO LAY OUT

00:43:58.068 --> 00:43:59.603
THAT'S AN ADDITIONAL FIVE

00:43:59.670 --> 00:44:00.304
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR

00:44:00.371 --> 00:44:01.538
THOSE CITIES AND OTHER LOCAL

00:44:01.605 --> 00:44:02.639
JURISDICTIONS.

00:44:02.706 --> 00:44:04.141
AND GENERAL PURPOSE FUNDING SO

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:05.342
WE BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL HELP

00:44:05.409 --> 00:44:06.977
PUSH LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IN THE

00:44:07.044 --> 00:44:08.746
RIGHT DIRECTION BECAUSE WE NEED

00:44:08.812 --> 00:44:10.681
THEM TO BE THE STATE'S PARTNERS

00:44:10.748 --> 00:44:12.316
IN SOLVING THIS HOUSING CRISIS.

00:44:12.383 --> 00:44:13.984
OVER THE LONG TERM PROPOSING TO

00:44:14.051 --> 00:44:15.853
REVISE THAT RENO GOALS WHICH IS

00:44:15.919 --> 00:44:16.553
REGIONAL HOUSING NEEDS

00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:18.188
ASSESSMENT AND MAKING SURE THAT

00:44:18.255 --> 00:44:19.890
THOSE SCHOOLS ACTUALLY REFLECT

00:44:19.957 --> 00:44:20.791
LOCAL INPUT.

00:44:20.858 --> 00:44:22.292
ARE TIED TO STATE GOALS IN ARE

00:44:22.359 --> 00:44:23.827
DEVELOPED THROUGH A PROCESS THAT

00:44:23.894 --> 00:44:25.529
IS ROBUST AND THAT MAKES SENSE

00:44:25.596 --> 00:44:26.864
SO OUR DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND

00:44:26.930 --> 00:44:27.598
COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT WILL

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:28.432

A NEW PLAN TO MAKE THESE GOALS

00:44:31.001 --> 00:44:32.669
MAKE SENSE LOOK AT LOCAL INPUT

00:44:32.736 --> 00:44:34.204
FOR THEM AND MOST IMPORTANTLY

00:44:34.271 --> 00:44:35.339
OVERTIME WILL ENFORCE THEM AND I

00:44:35.406 --> 00:44:36.573
KNOW THE GOVERNOR HAS GOTTEN A

00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:37.808
LOT OF COMMENTS.

00:44:37.875 --> 00:44:39.643
ABOUT HIS PROPOSAL THAT IN THE

00:44:39.710 --> 00:44:40.177

00:44:40.244 --> 00:44:41.578
SOME OF THIS TRANSPORTATION

00:44:41.645 --> 00:44:44.348

00:44:45.215 --> 00:44:47.017
GOALS THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN IN

00:44:55.459 --> 00:44:56.960
THAT EVERY JURISDICTION KNOWS

00:44:57.027 --> 00:44:58.195
WHAT HE NEEDS TO DO TO SOLVE

00:44:58.262 --> 00:44:59.196
WHAT IT'S BECOME A STATE WIDE

00:44:59.263 --> 00:45:00.664
CRISIS.

00:45:00.731 --> 00:45:06.370
AT THE SAME TIME THE GOVERNOR AS

THE FUNDING MAY BE WITHHELD DOWN

00:45:12.876 --> 00:45:13.744

00:45:13.811 --> 00:45:15.979
THEM TIME SO THAT THEY CAN MEET

00:45:16.046 --> 00:45:16.680
THEIR GOALS.

00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:17.448
THAT THAT FUNDING CAN BE

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:18.582
RESTORED SO THAT'S SOMETHING

00:45:18.649 --> 00:45:19.583
THAT I KNOW WILL BE A

00:45:19.650 --> 00:45:21.385

00:45:55.886 --> 00:45:56.954
CERTAINLY THE GOVERNOR'S TEAM

00:45:57.020 --> 00:45:58.155
FEELS THERE'S NO REASON WHY

00:45:58.222 --> 00:45:59.490
OTHER COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE

00:45:59.556 --> 00:46:00.924

ADDITIONAL FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

00:46:11.702 --> 00:46:13.337
DOLLAR EXPANSION.

00:46:13.403 --> 00:46:13.871

MEDIAN INCOME. TWO FINAL POINTS

00:46:33.857 --> 00:46:34.758
ALL MAKE ON HOUSING ONE IS THAT

00:46:34.825 --> 00:46:35.659
THE GOVERNOR RECENTLY SIGNED AN

00:46:35.726 --> 00:46:36.593

INVENTORY OF ACCESS STATE

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:39.029
PROPERTY WE THINK THIS IS A

00:46:39.096 --> 00:46:40.397
GREAT WAY TO BEAT THESE

00:46:40.464 --> 00:46:41.832
PROPERTIES OUT TO DEVELOPERS ARE

00:46:41.899 --> 00:46:43.800
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THIS IS LAND.

00:46:43.867 --> 00:46:45.536
THAT WE ALWAYS HAVE ALREADY HAD

00:46:45.602 --> 00:46:47.070
IT COULD MAYBE IN PLACES WHERE

00:46:47.137 --> 00:46:48.972
IT'S APPROPRIATE FOR HOUSING AND

00:46:49.039 --> 00:46:50.474
WE CAN SIMPLY BIT OUT OR

00:46:50.541 --> 00:46:52.276
TRANSFER THAT PROPERTY OVER.

00:46:52.342 --> 00:46:53.377
AND GET THAT HOUSING BILLS AS

00:46:53.443 --> 00:46:56.246
SOON AS POSSIBLE THING I'LL

00:46:56.313 --> 00:46:57.681
POINT IS AS A SUCCESSOR TO

WE PROPOSE REMOVING THAT

00:47:12.329 --> 00:47:13.864
THRESHOLD AND COMBINING THIS

00:47:13.931 --> 00:47:15.432
PROGRAM I'M SORRY NOT COMBINING

00:47:15.499 --> 00:47:17.334

BILLION DOLLARS --

WHEN ALL IS SAID AND DONE --

00:48:42.786 --> 00:48:43.587
WE'VE PASSED THE FEDERAL

00:48:43.654 --> 00:48:46.156
GOVERNMENT FOR A 100% COST YEAR

00:48:46.223 --> 00:48:47.491
FOR THEM TO PICK UP ALL OF THEM.

00:48:47.557 --> 00:48:48.659
AFTER THE MOST RECENT PACKAGE

00:48:48.725 --> 00:48:50.027
THEY GAVE US --

00:48:50.093 --> 00:48:52.029
IT WAS 90% AND THAT WAS ACTUALLY

00:48:52.095 --> 00:48:53.263
HARD WIRED INTO FEDERAL

00:48:53.330 --> 00:48:54.531
LEGISLATION --

00:48:54.598 --> 00:48:55.932
MORE TRADITIONALLY --

ARE ASSUMING IN OUR BUDGET --

00:49:01.571 --> 00:49:02.472
THE MOST CONSERVATIVE OF THOSE

00:49:02.539 --> 00:49:04.074
ESTIMATES FOR NOW THAT THE STATE

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:05.609
WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR PICKING

00:49:05.676 --> 00:49:08.645
UP 25% OF THE OVERALL COST --

00:49:08.712 --> 00:49:09.980
I KNOW ON TWITTER THERE WAS SOME

00:49:10.047 --> 00:49:11.248
TALK ABOUT THERE NOT BEING ANY

00:49:11.315 --> 00:49:12.616
FEDERAL ASSISTANCE BUT WE

00:49:12.683 --> 00:49:13.817
BELIEVE THAT --

00:49:13.884 --> 00:49:14.685
THE PRESIDENT AND THE

00:49:14.751 --> 00:49:15.786
ADMINISTRATION WILL FOLLOW THE

00:49:15.852 --> 00:49:17.721
LAW AND CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE

00:49:17.788 --> 00:49:19.456
ACCESS TO THOSE FUNDS.

00:49:19.523 --> 00:49:20.991
ALSO WHEN IT COMES THAT STATE

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:22.392
COST SHARE USUALLY LOCAL

00:49:22.459 --> 00:49:24.461
JURISDICTIONS HAVE TO PICK UP

00:49:24.528 --> 00:49:26.563
25% OF THAT WE'RE PROPOSING

00:49:26.630 --> 00:49:27.664
WAVING THAT REQUIREMENT --

00:49:27.731 --> 00:49:28.665
WE KNOW LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ARE

00:49:28.732 --> 00:49:30.167
ALREADY DEALING WITH THE FIRE

00:49:30.233 --> 00:49:31.468
AND THE STATE WILL PICK UP THE

00:49:31.535 --> 00:49:33.337
FULL SHARE AND THIS SHOULD SAVE

00:49:33.403 --> 00:49:37.607
THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS OVER A

00:49:37.674 --> 00:49:38.775

MONITORING SYSTEM AND AS WE KNOW

00:49:51.521 --> 00:49:52.522
IN EARTHQUAKES EVEN A COUPLE OF

00:49:52.589 --> 00:49:54.057
SECONDS CAN MAKE SUCH A BIG

00:49:54.124 --> 00:49:55.492
DIFFERENCE --

00:49:55.559 --> 00:49:56.093
USING OUR MUTUAL AID SYSTEM IN

00:57:33.583 --> 00:57:34.484
THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND

00:57:34.551 --> 00:57:36.286

TAKE OUT TO USE THE WORD THAT

00:57:37.487 --> 00:57:38.922
THE GOVERNOR USES A LOT A LOT OF

00:57:38.988 --> 00:57:40.456
INTENTIONALITY --

CO ALTER THE ADMINISTRATION --

00:57:43.793 --> 00:57:45.028
AND THIS IS IMPORTANT OF THE

00:57:45.094 --> 00:57:46.196
GOVERNOR BECAUSE HE'S WRITTEN

00:57:46.262 --> 00:57:47.697
ACTUALLY A BOOK ABOUT THIS --

00:57:47.764 --> 00:57:49.599
BASED ON HIS TIME AS MAYOR AND

00:57:49.666 --> 00:57:51.034

00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:53.536

00:57:57.373 --> 00:58:01.177
EDITION --

00:58:01.244 --> 00:58:01.811
SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I KNOW

00:58:01.878 --> 00:58:03.112
WILL BE.

00:58:03.179 --> 00:58:03.446
I ALREADY --

00:58:03.513 --> 00:58:04.948
GOING FORWARD. THREE LAST POINTS

FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE

00:58:06.683 --> 00:58:07.717
CENSUS WE KNOW THERE'S BEEN A

00:58:07.784 --> 00:58:09.085
LOT OF CONTROVERSY AT THE

00:58:09.152 --> 00:58:11.054
FEDERAL LEVEL ABOUT THE CENSUS.

00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.455
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS THERE WE

00:58:12.522 --> 00:58:13.323
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT IN OUR

00:58:13.389 --> 00:58:15.291
BUDGET WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN

00:58:15.358 --> 00:58:16.593
TO GET PEOPLE COUNTED.

00:58:16.659 --> 00:58:17.961
AT SOME POINT FOR HOW WE

00:58:18.027 --> 00:58:19.629
ALLOCATE STATES SERVICES AND

00:58:19.696 --> 00:58:20.830
IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT AT THE

00:58:20.897 --> 00:58:22.498
FEDERAL LEVEL FOR KEEPING THAT

00:58:22.565 --> 00:58:24.200
ADDITIONAL CONGRESSIONAL SEAT --

00:58:24.267 --> 00:58:26.002
WE'VE HAD TEN MILLION DOLLARS

AN ADDITIONAL FUNDING.

00:58:28.705 --> 00:58:29.973
AND FINALLY WE HAVE TWENTY

00:58:30.039 --> 00:58:32.442
MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE THIS IS

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:34.510
THE STATE AMERICORPS PROGRAM AND

00:58:34.577 --> 00:58:35.511
WE PROPOSE.

00:58:35.578 --> 00:58:36.813
INCREASING ENROLLMENT IN THIS

00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:37.981

00:58:48.324 --> 00:58:49.859
EDUCATION.

00:58:49.926 --> 00:58:51.527
SO THAT'S THE BUDGET --

00:58:51.594 --> 00:58:52.962
ONE OTHER THING I'LL SAY IS THAT

00:58:53.029 --> 00:58:54.163
WHEN IT COMES TO EARLY ACTIONS

00:58:54.230 --> 00:58:55.265

AND LET ME LIVE IN OUT RIGHT NOW

00:59:12.115 --> 00:59:13.850
FIRST ARE UPGRADES TO THE NINE

FOURTH IS THE FUNDING FOR THAT

AND THAT THERE'S NO DIVIDE.

01:00:06.936 --> 01:00:09.138

01:01:46.436 --> 01:01:47.737
BRIDGE AT STRUCTURE.

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:48.971
I'LL JUST KNOW THAT THIS IS OUR

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.273
INITIAL ASSESSMENT OF SOME OF

01:01:50.339 --> 01:01:52.341
THESE MAJOR PROPOSALS AND THAT

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:53.576
WE HAVE MUCH WORK IN THE COMING

01:01:53.643 --> 01:01:54.744

ASSESSING WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED

01:01:59.148 --> 01:02:00.116
LOOKING AT THE TRAILER BILL

01:02:00.183 --> 01:02:01.117
THAT'S STILL IN DEVELOPMENT AND

01:02:01.184 --> 01:02:01.984
FALLING UNDER FULLY

01:02:02.051 --> 01:02:04.353
UNDERSTANDING THE IMPLICATIONS

01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:05.588
OF THESE PROPOSALS.

01:02:05.655 --> 01:02:07.023
TURNING TO THE FIRST PAGE THIS

01:02:07.090 --> 01:02:08.925
CHURCH SHOWS THE BREAKDOWN OF

01:02:08.991 --> 01:02:10.093
THE GOVERNOR'S --

01:02:10.159 --> 01:02:11.894
DISTRIBUTION OF DISCRETIONARY

01:02:11.961 --> 01:02:14.030
RESOURCES WE DO A BOTTOMS UP

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.531
TALLYING OF WHAT WE BELIEVE THE

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:17.333
GOVERNOR HAD AT HIS DISCRETION

01:02:17.400 --> 01:02:18.734
TO ALLOCATE IN THE BUDGET.

01:02:18.801 --> 01:02:20.470
WITH UNDER OUR ESTIMATES THAT IS

01:02:20.536 --> 01:02:22.038
TWENTY POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS

01:02:22.105 --> 01:02:23.673
AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR THE

01:02:23.739 --> 01:02:24.740
CONSTITUTIONAL SPENDING

01:02:24.807 --> 01:02:26.809
REQUIREMENTS CHANGES IN CASELOAD

01:02:26.876 --> 01:02:28.177
PROGRAM COSTS AND NEW

01:02:28.244 --> 01:02:30.580
LEGISLATION.

01:02:30.646 --> 01:02:32.115
YOU'LL NOTE THAT THIS IS ABOUT

01:02:32.181 --> 01:02:33.516
SIX BILLION DOLLARS HIGHER THAN

01:02:33.583 --> 01:02:34.917
THE DISCRETIONARY --

01:02:34.984 --> 01:02:37.053
SURPLUS THAT WE ESTIMATED IN

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:38.754
NOVEMBER AND AS WAS ALREADY

01:02:38.821 --> 01:02:40.790
REFERENCE IS LARGELY DUE TO

01:02:40.857 --> 01:02:43.092
LOWER THAN ESTIMATED COSTS IN

01:02:43.159 --> 01:02:47.096
THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM.

01:02:47.163 --> 01:02:48.631
ABOUT HALF.

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.399
OF THESE DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES

01:02:50.466 --> 01:02:52.135
ARE ALLOCATED TO ONE TIME DOT

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:54.504
RELATED SPENDING A QUARTER TO

01:02:54.570 --> 01:02:56.072
ONE TIME FOR DRAMATIC SPENDING

01:02:56.139 --> 01:02:57.440
AND THEN THE REMAINDER SPLIT

01:02:57.507 --> 01:02:59.008
ABOUT FIFTY FIFTY BETWEEN

01:02:59.075 --> 01:03:01.277
DISCRETIONARY RESERVES AN

01:03:01.344 --> 01:03:02.778
ONGOING SPENDING.

01:03:02.845 --> 01:03:04.280
IF YOU TURN TO THE NEXT PAGE

01:03:04.347 --> 01:03:06.582
THIS TABLE SUMMARIZES THE MAJOR

01:03:06.649 --> 01:03:07.950
OP PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:03:08.017 --> 01:03:10.586
BUDGET ON THE NON PROPOSITION

01:03:10.653 --> 01:03:11.454
NINETY EIGHT SAID THE BUDGET SO

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:13.422
EXCLUDING FUNDING FOR K. THROUGH

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:16.092
FOURTEEN SCHOOLS --

01:03:16.159 --> 01:03:17.693
JUST TO TOUCH ON THAT QUICKLY

01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.228
THE LARGEST PROPOSAL I WITHIN

01:03:19.295 --> 01:03:20.496
THE PROPOSITION NINETY A

01:03:20.563 --> 01:03:22.498
GUARANTEE IS TO PROVIDE THE

01:03:22.565 --> 01:03:23.799
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA.

01:03:23.866 --> 01:03:26.002
A ROUGHLY THREE POINT 5% --

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:28.104
COLA ADJUSTMENT --

01:03:28.171 --> 01:03:29.772
AND TO FIND --

01:03:29.839 --> 01:03:34.010
THOSE GRADE FUNDING RATES.

01:03:34.076 --> 01:03:35.811
SO GOING THROUGH THE CHART FIRST

01:03:35.878 --> 01:03:37.713
ON THE DAYTON LIABILITY IS ONE

01:03:37.780 --> 01:03:38.581
OF THE KEY QUESTIONS WILL BE

01:03:38.648 --> 01:03:40.283
EXACT EXAMINING IN THE COMING

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:41.851
MONTHS -- IN

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:42.552
TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S

01:03:42.618 --> 01:03:44.220
PROPOSALS ON THAT MY ABILITIES

01:03:44.287 --> 01:03:45.154
IS WHETHER OR NOT THESE WOULD

01:03:45.221 --> 01:03:46.289
PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE THE

01:03:46.355 --> 01:03:47.890
LARGEST BANG FOR THE BUCK IN

01:03:47.957 --> 01:03:50.826
TERMS OF FUTURE SAVINGS.

01:03:50.893 --> 01:03:52.328
WE ALSO WOULD KNOW THAT --

01:03:52.395 --> 01:03:54.230
IN TERMS OF THE ESTIMATES FOR

01:03:54.297 --> 01:03:55.965
THE SAVINGS ON PAYMENTS THE

01:03:56.032 --> 01:03:57.266
PENSION PLANS THAT WE WOUD

01:03:57.333 --> 01:03:59.302
FOCUS ON THE NET SAVINGS THAT

01:03:59.368 --> 01:04:01.037
THESE ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS --

01:04:01.103 --> 01:04:02.538
COULD PROVIDE AND THAT WE

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.106
UNDERSTAND THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:04:04.173 --> 01:04:05.274
IN THE PROCESS OF GETTING SOME

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:07.009
ADDITIONAL MODELING FROM THE

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:08.778
PENSION SYSTEMS TO UNDERSTAND

01:04:08.844 --> 01:04:10.580
THE RANGE OF POSSIBLE SAVINGS.

01:04:10.646 --> 01:04:12.448
THAT THESE PAYMENTS COULD MAKE

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:14.850
IT COULD NOT PROVIDE.

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:16.352
SO ANOTHER ITEM ON EARLY

01:04:16.419 --> 01:04:17.620
EDUCATION AS A WAS ALREADY

01:04:17.687 --> 01:04:18.921
MENTIONED IS THE PRE SCHOOL

01:04:18.988 --> 01:04:20.356
EXPANSION THE PRE SCHOOL

01:04:20.423 --> 01:04:21.791
EXPANSION AND TURN IT LEAST IN

01:04:21.857 --> 01:04:23.626
ITS EARLY PHASES WHAT TARGET

01:04:23.693 --> 01:04:24.527
CHILDREN --

01:04:24.594 --> 01:04:26.362
WHO THE RESEARCH CLEARLY SHOWS

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:28.231
BENEFITS THE MOST BENEFIT THE

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:29.232
MOST FROM --

01:04:29.298 --> 01:04:31.467
THIS TYPE OF EARLY EDUCATION LOW

01:04:31.534 --> 01:04:32.735
INCOME CHILDREN.

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.337
THE EARLY OTHER EARLY EDUCATION

01:04:34.403 --> 01:04:36.205
PROPOSALS KINDERGARTEN FACILITY

01:04:36.272 --> 01:04:37.907
IS WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.375
FACILITIES THESE ARE LARGELY

01:04:39.442 --> 01:04:40.176
STILL IN DEVELOPMENT WE HOPE TO

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:41.844
KNOW MORE ONCE THE TRAILER BILL

01:04:41.911 --> 01:04:44.547
IS RELEASED.

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:45.715
THE GOVERNOR TAKES A BIT OF A

01:04:45.781 --> 01:04:47.850
DIFFERENT APPROACH WHEN IT COMES --

01:04:47.917 --> 01:04:48.818
TO THE UNIVERSITIES AND

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.586
PROVIDING ONGOING AUGMENTATIONS

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:52.288
IN THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION AS

01:04:52.355 --> 01:04:53.389
WAS ALREADY NOTED THE

01:04:53.456 --> 01:04:54.724
AUGMENTATIONS --

01:04:54.790 --> 01:04:55.591
OUTLINED IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:04:55.658 --> 01:04:57.093
BUDGET OUR FOR SPECIFIC

01:04:57.159 --> 01:04:58.227
ACTIVITIES --

01:04:58.294 --> 01:04:59.428
AND PRIORITIES OF THE

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:01.030
ADMINISTRATION WE THINK

01:05:01.097 --> 01:05:02.665
TARGETING THESE ADDITIONAL

01:05:02.732 --> 01:05:05.034
RESOURCES TO SPECIFIC --

01:05:05.101 --> 01:05:08.137
EXPECTATIONS FROM FROM THE LEDGE

01:05:08.204 --> 01:05:08.871
WE TOOK A MORE ROBUST

01:05:08.938 --> 01:05:10.006
CONVERSATION AND BETTER FISCAL

01:05:10.072 --> 01:05:11.540
ACCOUNTABILITY OF THE

01:05:11.607 --> 01:05:14.510
UNIVERSITY'S.

01:05:14.577 --> 01:05:15.478
IN TERMS OF THE CAL WORKS

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:16.512
AUGMENTATION --

01:05:16.579 --> 01:05:17.913
THE CAL WORKS AUGMENTATION TAKES

01:05:17.980 --> 01:05:19.382
A BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH

01:05:19.448 --> 01:05:20.716
THAN WHAT THE LEGISLATURE LAID

01:05:20.783 --> 01:05:22.285
OUT IN ITS INTENT LANGUAGE LAST

01:05:22.351 --> 01:05:23.252
YEAR.

01:05:23.319 --> 01:05:24.720
AS YOU ALL KNOW THE LEGISLATURE

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:26.689
STATED THAT THAT IT IS IT'S GOAL

01:05:26.756 --> 01:05:28.391
OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD FOR THE

01:05:28.457 --> 01:05:31.027
CAL WORKS GRANT LEVELS REACH 50%

01:05:31.093 --> 01:05:32.728
OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL.

01:05:32.795 --> 01:05:34.397
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL WOULD

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:36.766
INCREASE THE POWER GRANT LEVELS

01:05:36.832 --> 01:05:38.534
250% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY

01:05:38.601 --> 01:05:41.203
LEVEL BUT ONLY FOR A FAMILY OF

01:05:41.270 --> 01:05:42.505
THREE FOR ALL OTHER FAMILY SIZES

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:44.206
IT WOULD REPRESENT A THREE POINT

01:05:44.273 --> 01:05:45.241
1%.

01:05:45.308 --> 01:05:47.343
INCREASE THIRTEEN FORTY THREE

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:48.778
THIRTEEN POINT 1% --

01:05:48.844 --> 01:05:50.813
GRANT INCREASE --

01:05:50.880 --> 01:05:53.382
TO TO THOSE FAMILIES.

01:05:53.449 --> 01:05:54.650
AS WAS ALREADY NOTED --

01:05:54.717 --> 01:05:56.652
THE ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO

01:05:56.719 --> 01:05:58.354
MAINTAIN THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE

01:05:58.421 --> 01:06:01.891
SERVICES 7% SERVICE --

01:06:01.957 --> 01:06:03.926
INCREASE DESPITE NOT --

01:06:03.993 --> 01:06:06.829
MAINTAINING THE MCO TAX.

01:06:06.896 --> 01:06:08.998
UNDER CURRENT LAW THOSE THOSE

01:06:09.065 --> 01:06:10.966
TWO ARE TIED TOGETHER.

01:06:11.033 --> 01:06:13.302
AND THE ADMINISTRATION ALSO

01:06:13.369 --> 01:06:16.806
MAKES A NUMBER OF CHANGES --

01:06:16.872 --> 01:06:18.607
TO THE BOB BUDGET PACKAGE THAT

01:06:18.674 --> 01:06:20.843
WAS PASSED TWO YEARS AGO WITH

01:06:20.910 --> 01:06:21.911
FOR THE IN HOME SUPPORTIVE

01:06:21.977 --> 01:06:24.080
SERVICES PROGRAM.

01:06:24.146 --> 01:06:25.381
THESE CHANGES --

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:27.116
WEAR DRESS WE BELIEVE SOME OF

01:06:27.183 --> 01:06:28.918
THE CURRENT ISSUES AND HOW THAT

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:30.186
PROGRAM IS FUNDED THE LOCAL

01:06:30.252 --> 01:06:31.487
LEVEL HOW --

01:06:31.554 --> 01:06:33.122
COUNTIES RECEIVE FUNDING TO PAY

01:06:33.189 --> 01:06:34.390
FOR THEIR SHARE OF COSTS BUT AT

01:06:34.457 --> 01:06:35.424
LEAST BASED ON OUR INITIAL

01:06:35.491 --> 01:06:36.692
ASSESSMENT IT DOES LOOK LIKE

01:06:36.759 --> 01:06:37.693
COUNTY IS.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:39.462
COSTS WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY

01:06:39.528 --> 01:06:41.397
WITHIN A COUPLE YEARS THROUGH

01:06:41.464 --> 01:06:42.498
THE FUNDING STREAMS THAT THEY

01:06:42.565 --> 01:06:44.667
CURRENTLY PROVIDE RECEIVE IN

01:06:44.734 --> 01:06:48.003
NINETEEN NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT.

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:50.239
I'M MOVING ON TO SOME OF THE

01:06:50.306 --> 01:06:52.908
HEALTH CARE ISSUES WE WOULD JUST

01:06:52.975 --> 01:06:54.076
NOTE THAT --

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.911
THE PENALTY THE INDIVIDUAL

01:06:55.978 --> 01:06:57.346
HEALTH CARE MANDATE PENALTY AND

01:06:57.413 --> 01:06:59.148
THE SUBSIDIES ARE NOT REFLECTED

01:06:59.215 --> 01:07:00.316
IN THE GOVERNOR'S BOTTOM LINE

01:07:00.383 --> 01:07:01.417
BUDGET.

01:07:01.484 --> 01:07:03.486
WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR

01:07:03.552 --> 01:07:04.453
ESTIMATES THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:07:04.520 --> 01:07:05.755
ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:07:05.821 --> 01:07:07.256
DOLLARS WORTH AND REVENUES FROM

01:07:07.323 --> 01:07:09.358
THESE PENALTIES THAT.

01:07:09.425 --> 01:07:10.292
I'VE DONE AT LEAST BASED BASED

01:07:10.359 --> 01:07:11.594
ON OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT SEEMS

01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:13.129
LIKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE WE

01:07:13.195 --> 01:07:14.897
DON'T YET HAVE DETAIL ON HOW THE

01:07:14.964 --> 01:07:16.499
PENALTY REVENUE --

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:17.933
X. WOULD BE DISTRIBUTED FOR THE

01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:23.205
SUBSIDIES BUT WE WOULD NOTE THAT --

01:07:23.272 --> 01:07:24.707
IN.

01:07:24.774 --> 01:07:25.441
THE PENALTY REVENUE AND THE

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:26.909
SUBSIDIES ARE CONFLICTING GOALS

01:07:26.976 --> 01:07:28.043
OVER TIME IF THE PENALTY IS

01:07:28.110 --> 01:07:30.179
EFFECTIVE REVENUE SHOULD DECLINE

01:07:30.246 --> 01:07:31.814
BECAUSE MORE PEOPLE ARE.

01:07:31.881 --> 01:07:33.916
SIGNING UP FOR COVERAGE ON WHICH

01:07:33.983 --> 01:07:36.118
COULD CAUSE SUBSIDIES --

01:07:36.185 --> 01:07:37.453
TO DECLINE OVER TIME AS WELL

01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:39.288
UNLESS THEY ARE GOING TO BE

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:39.889
SUPPORTED THROUGH THE GENERAL

01:07:39.955 --> 01:07:42.158
FUND.

01:07:42.224 --> 01:07:43.292
IN TERMS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PAID

01:07:43.359 --> 01:07:44.927
FAMILY LEAVE PROPOSAL IT'S OUR

01:07:44.994 --> 01:07:46.028
UNDERSTANDING THAT THE INITIAL

01:07:46.095 --> 01:07:48.264
PLAN IS TO DRIVE DOWN SOME OF

01:07:48.330 --> 01:07:49.698
THE RESERVE WITHIN THE

01:07:49.765 --> 01:07:51.467
DISABILITY INSURANCE FUND --

01:07:51.534 --> 01:07:52.935
BUT AGAIN THERE'S NOT DIRECT

01:07:53.002 --> 01:07:54.403
FUNDING FOR THAT PLAN WITHIN

01:07:54.470 --> 01:07:55.871
WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AS

01:07:55.938 --> 01:07:59.141
WAS ALREADY MENTIONED.

01:07:59.208 --> 01:08:00.176
MOVING TO HOUSING --

01:08:00.242 --> 01:08:00.776
THE TAX CREDIT EXPANSION THAT

01:08:00.843 --> 01:08:03.813
WAS SO IT'S SOMETHING THAT THE

01:08:03.879 --> 01:08:05.848
GOVERNOR'S DOES NOT EXPECT WILL

01:08:05.915 --> 01:08:07.216
BE UTILIZED WITHIN THEIR BUDGET

01:08:07.283 --> 01:08:08.584
WINDOW --

01:08:08.651 --> 01:08:10.319
WHILE THERE IS THIS FIVE FIVE

01:08:10.386 --> 01:08:11.454
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR EXPANSION

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.122
WE DON'T SEE --

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:14.857
ANY CHANGES IN REVENUES --

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:16.926
WITHIN THE THE BUDGET WINDOW OF

01:08:16.992 --> 01:08:18.461
OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET MEANING

01:08:18.527 --> 01:08:19.662
THAT THEY DON'T EXPECT THEM TO

01:08:19.728 --> 01:08:21.163
BE CLAIMED WITHIN THAT TIME

01:08:21.230 --> 01:08:23.432
PERIOD.

01:08:23.499 --> 01:08:24.900
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET --

01:08:24.967 --> 01:08:26.669
ALSO RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:08:26.735 --> 01:08:28.037
WHICH POPULATIONS THE

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.371
LEGISLATURE LIKE TO TARGET FOR

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:31.373
HOUSING ASSISTANCE.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:33.209
ROUGHLY ABOUT A QUARTER OF LOW

01:08:33.275 --> 01:08:34.844
INCOME INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE

01:08:34.910 --> 01:08:36.712
RECEIVE SOME FORM OF HOUSING

01:08:36.779 --> 01:08:38.614
ASSISTANCE.

01:08:38.681 --> 01:08:40.449
THERE SIMPLY IS NOT CURRENTLY

01:08:40.516 --> 01:08:41.484
SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO PROVIDE

01:08:41.550 --> 01:08:42.985
EVERY LOW INCOME PERSON IN IN

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.086
THE STATE WITH THIS TYPE OF

01:08:44.153 --> 01:08:45.921
ASSISTANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:08:45.988 --> 01:08:47.857
DOES ALLOCATE IS A MUCH LARGER

01:08:47.923 --> 01:08:50.359
PROPORTION OF FUNDING. TO HIRE

01:08:50.426 --> 01:08:51.927
SOMEONE THERE ARE RELATIVELY

01:08:51.994 --> 01:08:53.662
HIGHER INCOME LEVELS AND THIS

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:55.064
JUST RAISES A QUESTION FOR THE

01:08:55.130 --> 01:08:56.799
LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHO IT

01:08:56.866 --> 01:08:58.934
WOULD LIKE TO TARGET WITH THESE

01:08:59.001 --> 01:09:01.337
LIMITED RESOURCES.

01:09:01.403 --> 01:09:02.805
ON DISASTERS THE GOVERNOR'S

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.006
PROPOSAL --

01:09:04.073 --> 01:09:06.542
RAISES SOME SOME QUESTIONS --

01:09:06.609 --> 01:09:09.111
FIRST WHAT FUNDING SOURCE TO USE

01:09:09.178 --> 01:09:10.012
FOR SOME ACTIVITIES IN

01:09:10.079 --> 01:09:10.813
PARTICULAR THE GOVERNOR'S

01:09:10.880 --> 01:09:13.782
PROPOSAL USES GENERAL FUND. FOR

01:09:13.849 --> 01:09:14.884
SOME ITEMS THAT HAVE

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:16.352
HISTORICALLY BEEN PAID --

01:09:16.418 --> 01:09:19.255
BY SPECIAL FUNDS LIKE THE NINE

01:09:19.321 --> 01:09:21.457
ONE ONE OUR SERVICE IMPROVEMENTS.

01:09:21.524 --> 01:09:22.291
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO

01:09:22.358 --> 01:09:23.392
RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT

01:09:23.459 --> 01:09:25.394
LOCAL ASSISTANCE AND WHAT TYPES

01:09:25.461 --> 01:09:27.263
AND HOW SUSTAINABLE LOCAL

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:29.331
ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS --

01:09:29.398 --> 01:09:29.798
TO THESE --

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:31.200
COMMUNITIES AFFECTED --

01:09:31.267 --> 01:09:32.034
MAYBE.

01:09:32.101 --> 01:09:34.670
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SINCE

01:09:34.737 --> 01:09:35.938
STATE ASSISTANCE.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.373
AND THE LEGISLATURE MAY SIMPLY

01:09:37.439 --> 01:09:38.607
WANT TO CONSIDER WHAT IS

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:40.376
SUSTAINABLE OVER TIME IN TERMS

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:41.810
OF PROPERTY TAX BACK FILLS WHAT

01:09:41.877 --> 01:09:43.212
COMMUNITIES MIGHT WE EXPECT TO

01:09:43.279 --> 01:09:44.847
BE ABLE TO RECOVER FROM THESE

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:46.382
WILD FIRES --

01:09:46.448 --> 01:09:47.716
AND WHAT COMMUTE WHAT TYPES OF

01:09:47.783 --> 01:09:48.884
COMMITTEES MADE ME LONGER

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:51.620
ASSISTANT A LONGER PERIODS OF

01:09:51.687 --> 01:09:53.822
ASSISTANCE SIR COVER.

01:09:53.889 --> 01:09:55.658
LASTLY ON THIS PAGE --

01:09:55.724 --> 01:09:56.992
WE WOULDN'T RECOMMEND --

01:09:57.059 --> 01:09:59.361
SPLITTING THE TAX PROPOSALS AND

01:09:59.428 --> 01:10:01.163
CONSIDERING THEM SEPARATELY --

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:03.399
THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT IS

01:10:03.465 --> 01:10:05.534
ONE THAT IS HARD HAS BEEN HARD

01:10:05.601 --> 01:10:06.702
FOR THE STATE TO ESTIMATE WITH

01:10:06.769 --> 01:10:08.437
US SOME LEVEL OF ACCURACY IN

01:10:08.504 --> 01:10:09.905
TERMS OF THE TAKE UP AND THE

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:11.440
COSTS OVER TIME.

01:10:11.507 --> 01:10:12.441
SIMILARLY THE COOKIE ANY

01:10:12.508 --> 01:10:14.376
CONFORMITY ACTIONS TAKEN BY THE

01:10:14.443 --> 01:10:16.812
LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE AFFECTS ON

01:10:16.879 --> 01:10:18.147
REVENUES THAT MAY CHANGE OVER

01:10:18.213 --> 01:10:19.682
TIME AND HEARING THESE TWO

01:10:19.748 --> 01:10:21.016
POLICY PROPOSALS TOGETHER.

01:10:21.083 --> 01:10:22.718
PRESENTS CHALLENGES --

01:10:22.785 --> 01:10:24.119
IN TERMS OF TRYING TO ARRIVE AT

01:10:24.186 --> 01:10:26.722
A NET NEUTRAL REVENUE NEUTRAL --

01:10:26.789 --> 01:10:29.925
PACKAGE.

01:10:29.992 --> 01:10:32.061
TURNING TO THE LAST PAGE OF THE

01:10:32.127 --> 01:10:33.262
HANDOUT JUST SOME OVER ARCHING

01:10:33.329 --> 01:10:35.564
COMMENTS.

01:10:35.631 --> 01:10:36.732
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OUTSIDE

01:10:36.799 --> 01:10:38.367
LANDS MANY BUDGET PART POLICY

01:10:38.434 --> 01:10:40.069
PRIORITIES EARLY AND MANY OF

01:10:40.135 --> 01:10:41.704
THEM ARE IN KEEPING WITH RECENT

01:10:41.770 --> 01:10:43.806
LEGISLATIVE ACTION.

01:10:43.872 --> 01:10:44.773
THIS PROVIDES THE LEGISLATURE

01:10:44.840 --> 01:10:46.375
KEY OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH

01:10:46.442 --> 01:10:47.409
THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO FORM

01:10:47.476 --> 01:10:48.644
ITS OWN VIEW OF WHAT THESE

01:10:48.711 --> 01:10:50.646
POLICY SHOULD BE OVER THE COMING

01:10:50.713 --> 01:10:53.282
MONTHS.

01:10:53.349 --> 01:10:54.650
WE WERE NOTE THAT THE ONGOING

01:10:54.717 --> 01:10:56.185
COSTS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:10:56.251 --> 01:10:57.620
BUDGET WHICH ARE TWO POINT SEVEN

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:59.321
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:10:59.388 --> 01:11:01.123
IN THE BUDGET YEAR BUT GROWING

01:11:01.190 --> 01:11:02.458
TO THREE POINT FIVE BILLION

01:11:02.524 --> 01:11:03.158
DOLLARS --

01:11:03.225 --> 01:11:06.161
IN THE IN.

01:11:06.228 --> 01:11:06.829
TWENTY TWENTY ONE ARE ROUGHLY IN

01:11:06.895 --> 01:11:09.765
LINE WITH WHAT WE ASKED ALL

01:11:09.832 --> 01:11:11.600
UNDER OUR NOVEMBER ESTIMATES BUT

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.268
THERE ARE AREAS WHERE COST TO

01:11:13.335 --> 01:11:15.704
GROW FOR INSTANCE MANY OF THE

01:11:15.771 --> 01:11:17.039
ITEMS THAT THE GOVERNOR HAS IN

01:11:17.106 --> 01:11:18.273
HIS BUDGET FOR DISASTER

01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.909
MITIGATION OR COVERING RELIEF --

01:11:20.976 --> 01:11:22.745
ARE ONE TIME IN NATURE BUT THEY

01:11:22.811 --> 01:11:24.146
ARE THESE ARE LIKELY TO BE

01:11:24.213 --> 01:11:25.981
ONGOING COSTS FOR THE STATE.

01:11:26.048 --> 01:11:27.149
GIVEN THE FREQUENCY AND THE

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.817
SEVERITY OF DISASTERS OF THE

01:11:28.884 --> 01:11:30.853
STATE IS SEEN OVER THE PAST FEW

01:11:30.919 --> 01:11:32.454
YEARS.

01:11:32.521 --> 01:11:33.822
ALSO JUST NOTE --

01:11:33.889 --> 01:11:34.790
AS WAS BROUGHT UP THAT THE

01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:37.626
AUTHORITY. TO TRANSFER FUNDS OUT

01:11:37.693 --> 01:11:40.396
OF THE SFE YOU TO RESPOND TO

01:11:40.462 --> 01:11:42.064
DISASTERS IS SOMETHING HAT THE

01:11:42.131 --> 01:11:44.233
ADMINISTRATION IS LOOKING TO

01:11:44.299 --> 01:11:45.601
RENEW --

01:11:45.668 --> 01:11:47.069
RATHER QUICKLY IN THIS I THINK

01:11:47.136 --> 01:11:49.438
IS A KEY AREA OF CONSIDERATION

01:11:49.505 --> 01:11:50.806
FOR THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.207
BECAUSE OF THE SIZE OF THE

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:54.610
TRANSFERS THAT MAY HAPPEN AND

01:11:54.677 --> 01:11:58.113
THE TYPES OF BUDGET RESIST SIR

01:11:58.180 --> 01:11:59.548
RESILIENCY QUESTIONS THE

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:00.649
LEGISLATURE WANT TO CONSIDER OF

01:12:00.716 --> 01:12:02.685
OF HOW TO FIND THOSE TYPES OF

01:12:02.751 --> 01:12:03.552
TRANSFERS THERE IS.

01:12:03.619 --> 01:12:05.821
A VERY LARGE TRANSFER AT THE END

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:08.490
OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN THAT I THINK

01:12:08.557 --> 01:12:10.192
RAISES SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW

01:12:10.259 --> 01:12:11.360
TO STRUCTURE.

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:12.695
THE ABILITY OF THE

01:12:12.761 --> 01:12:15.431
ADMINISTRATION TO TAP IMMEDIATE

01:12:15.497 --> 01:12:17.132
BASIS BUT THEN ALSO KEEPS THE

01:12:17.199 --> 01:12:20.669
STATE'S RESERVES INTACT.

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:23.939
ON THE THIS BUDGET DOES.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.607
ALLOCATE A SMALLER SHARE OF

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:27.242
DISCRETIONARY RESOURCES TO

01:12:27.309 --> 01:12:29.812
RESERVES THEM PRIOR BUDGETS.

01:12:29.878 --> 01:12:31.747
ON NET DISCRETIONARY RESERVES

01:12:31.814 --> 01:12:34.083
WOULD BE ABOUT THREE BILLION

01:12:34.149 --> 01:12:34.650
DOLLARS UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

01:12:34.717 --> 01:12:36.218
BUDGET --

01:12:36.285 --> 01:12:37.519
BUT THAT SAID --

01:12:37.586 --> 01:12:38.587
THEY DO TAKE A NEW

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:40.923
INTERPRETATION OF PROPOSITION

01:12:40.989 --> 01:12:42.858
TWO WHICH NECESSITATES I ONE

01:12:42.925 --> 01:12:43.892
POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLAR

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.427
TRANSFERRED TO THE BUDGET

01:12:45.494 --> 01:12:46.428
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THE

01:12:46.495 --> 01:12:48.230
STATE'S CONSTITUTIONAL SAVINGS

01:12:48.297 --> 01:12:49.732
ACCOUNT.

01:12:49.798 --> 01:12:51.600
A CONSEQUENCE OF MAKING THAT

01:12:51.667 --> 01:12:53.202
TRIP TAKING THIS INTERPRETATION

01:12:53.268 --> 01:12:54.770
AND MAKING THAT TRANSFER TO THE

01:12:54.837 --> 01:12:55.304
BSA.

01:12:55.370 --> 01:12:56.472
IS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.307
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING IN THE

01:12:58.373 --> 01:12:59.775
BUDGET YEAR UNDER THE

01:12:59.842 --> 01:13:01.443
ADMINISTRATION'S ESTIMATES THERE

01:13:01.510 --> 01:13:03.245
WOULD BE INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING

01:13:03.312 --> 01:13:08.517
IN THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR WINDOW.

01:13:08.584 --> 01:13:09.118
TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE AS YOU

01:13:09.184 --> 01:13:11.286
KNOW THE LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR --

01:13:11.353 --> 01:13:12.688
AS PER THE BUDGET PACKAGE

01:13:12.755 --> 01:13:14.223
ADOPTED A PLAN FOR THAT

01:13:14.289 --> 01:13:15.591
INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING THAT IT

01:13:15.657 --> 01:13:16.925
ANTICIPATED STARTING IN THE

01:13:16.992 --> 01:13:19.428
BUDGET YEAR.

01:13:19.495 --> 01:13:20.863
CONSEQUENTLY CONCEPT THE

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:22.064
CONSEQUENCE OF THE NEW

01:13:22.131 --> 01:13:23.665
INTERPRETATION OF PROPOSITION

01:13:23.732 --> 01:13:24.600
TWO IS THAT THERE WOULD BE NO

01:13:24.666 --> 01:13:28.537
FUNDING AVAILABLE FOR THAT PLAN.

01:13:28.604 --> 01:13:30.272
WHILE THE GOVERNOR DOES NOT

01:13:30.339 --> 01:13:31.607
DEDICATE --

01:13:31.673 --> 01:13:32.741
A HIGHER SHARE OF DISCRETIONARY

01:13:32.808 --> 01:13:35.410
RESOURCES TO RESERVES --

01:13:35.477 --> 01:13:36.378
THE PAIN OUT OF DEBT AND

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:38.647
LIABILITIES DOES DO IMPROVE THE

01:13:38.714 --> 01:13:41.650
BUDGETS BOTTOM LINE AND REDUCE

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:45.053
COSTS IN THE LONG TERM --

01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.121
ONE THING TO NOTE HOWEVER  <u>I</u>

01:13:46.188 --> 01:13:47.422
JUST IN TERMS OF BUDGET

01:13:47.489 --> 01:13:49.158
RESILIENCY THE CHANGES TO THE

01:13:49.224 --> 01:13:51.293
CERTIFICATION PROCESS DO PRISON

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:52.761
FOR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT DO

01:13:52.828 --> 01:13:54.062
PRESENTS SOME QUESTIONS.

01:13:54.129 --> 01:13:55.531
ABOUT HOW CHANGES IN THE

01:13:55.597 --> 01:13:56.832
GUARANTEE --

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:58.433
WILL BE DEALT WITH WHEN WHETHER

01:13:58.500 --> 01:14:01.036
OR NOT THERE WILL BE ADJUSTMENTS

01:14:01.103 --> 01:14:03.038
WITHIN CURRENT THE CURRENT YEAR.

01:14:03.105 --> 01:14:04.773
ODD -- TO

01:14:04.840 --> 01:14:07.042
ADJUST THE GUARANTEE UP OR DOWN --

01:14:07.109 --> 01:14:08.410
AND WHETHER WHO WILL BEAR THE

01:14:08.477 --> 01:14:09.812
COSTS WHETHER IT'S THE NINETY

01:14:09.878 --> 01:14:11.480
EIGHT SIDE OF THE BUDGET OR THE

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:12.181
NON NINETY EIGHT SIDE OF THE

01:14:12.247 --> 01:14:13.182
BUDGET.

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:15.017
AS YOUR CALL THE CERTIFICATION

01:14:15.083 --> 01:14:16.785
PROCESS --

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:17.386
WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS ADOPTED

01:14:17.452 --> 01:14:21.890
AT RATHER COMPLEX MECHANISM TO

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:23.358
DEAL WITH.

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:25.627
OVER AND UNDER APPROPRIATIONS OF

01:14:25.694 --> 01:14:28.730
THE GUARANTEE OVERTIME --

01:14:28.797 --> 01:14:30.732
WHILE WE'RE ON SCHOOLS ARE JUST

01:14:30.799 --> 01:14:32.100
TWO THINGS TO NOTE THE FIRST IS

01:14:32.167 --> 01:14:34.002
THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL

01:14:34.069 --> 01:14:35.504
DOES NOT PROVIDE.

01:14:35.571 --> 01:14:37.472
A VERY LARGE QUESTION WITHIN THE

01:14:37.539 --> 01:14:38.473
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.242
GUARANTEE THAT IS IT DOES NOT

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.877
ALLOCATE VERY MUCH MONEY TO ONE

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:43.946
TIME SPENDING OVER THE PAST FEW

01:14:44.012 --> 01:14:44.913
YEARS.

01:14:44.980 --> 01:14:45.614
THERE HAS BEEN A PRETTY

01:14:45.681 --> 01:14:47.716
SIGNIFICANT QUESTION WITHIN THE

01:14:47.783 --> 01:14:48.417
NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:50.018
PROTECTING SCHOOLS FROM YEAR TO

01:14:50.085 --> 01:14:51.620
YEAR FLUCTUATIONS SUCH THAT THEY

01:14:51.687 --> 01:14:53.155
DON'T HAVE TO MAKE CUTS TO

01:14:53.222 --> 01:14:54.489
ONGOING PROGRAMS.

01:14:54.556 --> 01:14:55.390
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:14:55.457 --> 01:14:58.160
PROPOSAL THERE IS NOT A VERY

01:14:58.227 --> 01:14:59.595
LARGE QUESTION AT ALL.

01:14:59.661 --> 01:15:00.829
THE SECOND THING I WOULD NOTE

01:15:00.896 --> 01:15:02.664
ABOUT SCHOOLS IS THAT TO DATE

01:15:02.731 --> 01:15:04.399
THERE HAS NOT BEEN A DEPOSIT

01:15:04.466 --> 01:15:07.536
INTO THE SCHOOLS RESERVE ACCOUNT.

01:15:07.603 --> 01:15:10.138
CONSEQUENTLY SHOWED A DOWNTURN

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:11.073
CON.

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:12.341
THERE IS NOT A DEDICATED

01:15:12.407 --> 01:15:14.243
STATEWIDE SAVINGS ACCOUNT FOR

01:15:14.309 --> 01:15:16.311
SCHOOLS CURRENTLY THIS COULD PUT

01:15:16.378 --> 01:15:18.580
PRESSURE ON ANY WITHDRAWALS FROM

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:21.116
THE BUDGET STABILIZATION ACCOUNT --

01:15:21.183 --> 01:15:24.086
FOR SCHOOL SPENDING.

01:15:24.152 --> 01:15:25.587
LASTLY I'LL TOUCH ON REVENUES

01:15:25.654 --> 01:15:27.789
ARE REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE VERY

01:15:27.856 --> 01:15:29.491
SIMILAR TO THE ADMINISTRATION'S

01:15:29.558 --> 01:15:31.026
IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND IN THE

01:15:31.093 --> 01:15:34.062
OUT YEARS VERY SIMILAR.

01:15:34.129 --> 01:15:35.497
THAT SAID WE AND THE

01:15:35.564 --> 01:15:36.999
ADMINISTRATION PUT TOGETHER OUR

01:15:37.065 --> 01:15:38.533
REVENUE ESTIMATES PRIOR TO THE

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.335
DOWNTURN IN THE MARKET AT THE

01:15:40.402 --> 01:15:42.271
VERY END OF LAST YEAR.

01:15:42.337 --> 01:15:44.706
THIS POSES SOME REST.

01:15:44.773 --> 01:15:46.942
UNDER OUR ESTIMATES AND UNDER

01:15:47.009 --> 01:15:48.610
THE CURRENT CONSENSUS OF

01:15:48.677 --> 01:15:50.212
PROFESSIONAL ECONOMISTS IF THE

01:15:50.279 --> 01:15:51.413
STOCK MARKET STAYS AT ITS

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:53.282
ROUGHLY CURRENT LEVEL AND GROW

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:54.349
SOMEWHAT SLOWLY OVER THE CURRENT

01:15:54.416 --> 01:15:54.850
YEAR.

01:15:54.917 --> 01:15:56.084
WE BELIEVE THE REVENUE LOSS

01:15:56.151 --> 01:15:57.419
COULD BE ABOUT ONE TO TWO

01:15:57.486 --> 01:15:59.655
BILLION DOLLARS.

01:15:59.721 --> 01:16:01.390
THIS AMOUNT HOWEVER IS SOMETHING

01:16:01.456 --> 01:16:02.925
THAT LIKELY COULD BE ABSORBED BY

01:16:02.991 --> 01:16:04.426
THE CONSTITUTIONAL WERE SPENDING

01:16:04.493 --> 01:16:05.627
REQUIREMENTS.

01:16:05.694 --> 01:16:07.396
LARGELY UNDER PROPOSITION TWO

01:16:07.462 --> 01:16:09.264
AND WITH SOME REDUCTIONS IN THE

01:16:09.331 --> 01:16:09.765
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:16:09.831 --> 01:16:11.300
GUARANTEE.

01:16:11.366 --> 01:16:12.768
THAT SAID IF THE LOSSES TURN OUT

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.970
TO BE LARGER THERE IS INCREASED

01:16:15.037 --> 01:16:16.738
RISK AND THE THOSE

01:16:16.805 --> 01:16:17.239
CONSTITUTIONAL SPENDING

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:18.774
APARTMENTS NO LONGER WOULD BE

01:16:18.840 --> 01:16:19.908
ABLE TO ABSORB.

01:16:19.975 --> 01:16:21.276
THOSE REDUCTIONS AND THERE WOULD

01:16:21.343 --> 01:16:23.111
BE IMPACTS OF THE BUDGET BOTTOM

01:16:23.178 --> 01:16:25.047
LINE.

01:16:25.113 --> 01:16:26.014
THAT'S THE END OF MY COMMENTS

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:26.515
AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

01:16:26.581 --> 01:16:27.649
QUESTIONS.

HUMAN SERVICES THAT WILL REQUIRE

THAT'S GOING TO TAKE A LOT TO

01:17:33.048 --> 01:17:33.615
TALK ABOUT WHAT THAT WILL LOOK

01:17:33.682 --> 01:17:35.317

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:37.719

01:18:06.415 --> 01:18:07.416
FIRST.

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:08.784
BUT WHEN YOU'RE THINKING OF

01:18:08.850 --> 01:18:11.086

IT'S BETTER THAN OUR SHOES.

01:18:30.038 --> 01:18:31.640
FIRST LET ME OF COMPLIMENTS YOU

01:18:31.706 --> 01:18:32.808
THAT SERVE MY BEEN DOING THIS

01:18:32.874 --> 01:18:33.809
BUDGET STUFF FOR SIX YEARS

01:18:33.875 --> 01:18:34.776
THAT'S THE MOST DETAILED BUDGET

01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:36.278
OVERVIEW I THINK WE'VE HAD IN

01:18:36.344 --> 01:18:37.979
SIX YEARS AND UP WHILE IT WAS A

01:18:38.046 --> 01:18:39.347
FIRE HOSE --

01:18:39.414 --> 01:18:40.348
IT WAS AS MUCH APPRECIATED.

01:18:40.415 --> 01:18:40.982
I HAVE --

01:18:41.049 --> 01:18:42.384
MAYBE THREE QUICK QUESTIONS I

01:18:42.451 --> 01:18:42.951
WASN'T GOING TO ASK ONE ON

01:18:43.018 --> 01:18:45.654
EDUCATION BECAUSE I FIGURED WE'D

01:18:45.720 --> 01:18:47.622
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY.

01:18:47.689 --> 01:18:48.790
TO HAVE SOME CLOSE CONVERSATION

01:18:48.857 --> 01:18:49.758
ON THAT LATER BUT WHITE WINE NO

01:18:49.825 --> 01:18:51.026
DEPOSIT INTO THE SCHOOL

01:18:51.093 --> 01:18:52.994
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT.

01:18:53.061 --> 01:18:53.295
YES SO --

01:18:53.361 --> 01:18:57.065
I'VE HAD DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THIS --

01:18:57.132 --> 01:18:57.632
ON MY TEAM.

01:18:57.699 --> 01:18:59.634
BASICALLY UNDER PROPOSITION TWO

01:18:59.701 --> 01:19:00.469
THERE IS THE BUDGET

01:19:00.535 --> 01:19:02.637
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT AND THEN

01:19:02.704 --> 01:19:04.473
THE SCHOOL STABILIZATION ACCOUNT --

01:19:04.539 --> 01:19:05.640
IT'S TO THE BUDGET BUDGET

01:19:05.707 --> 01:19:06.508
STABILIZATION ACCOUNT THOSE ARE

01:19:06.575 --> 01:19:07.709
THE MANDATORY DEPOSITS THAT

01:19:07.776 --> 01:19:09.377
WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT. FOR

01:19:09.444 --> 01:19:11.012
THE SCHOOL STABILIZATION ACCOUNT --

01:19:11.079 --> 01:19:13.548
DEPOSITS ARE ONLY REQUIRED --

01:19:13.615 --> 01:19:15.217
WHEN A NUMBER OF VERY SPECIFIC

01:19:15.283 --> 01:19:16.885
CONDITIONS ARE MET AND IT TURNS

01:19:16.952 --> 01:19:18.320
OUT THAT WE NEED A NUMBER OF

01:19:18.386 --> 01:19:19.754
THOSE CONDITIONS THIS YEAR SO

01:19:19.821 --> 01:19:21.490
UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHTS

01:19:21.556 --> 01:19:22.958
THREE TESTS WE HAVE TO BE IN A

01:19:23.024 --> 01:19:24.960
TEST ONE YEAR WHICH MEANS THAT?

01:19:25.026 --> 01:19:26.228
THE AMOUNT COMING OUT OF STATE

01:19:26.294 --> 01:19:27.629
BUDGET IS A SET PERCENTAGE OF

01:19:27.696 --> 01:19:29.131
THE WHOLE.

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:29.965
RATHER THAN NECESSARILY

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.433
ADJUSTING FOR PERSONAL INCOME

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:33.168
GROWTH OR GENERAL FUND REVENUE

01:19:33.235 --> 01:19:34.402
GROWTH -- SO

01:19:34.469 --> 01:19:36.104
WE ARE IN A TEST ONE YEAR --

01:19:36.171 --> 01:19:38.006
WE ALSO ELIMINATED ALL

01:19:38.073 --> 01:19:39.407
OUTSTANDING MAINTENANCE FACTOR

01:19:39.474 --> 01:19:41.910
PRIOR TO THE YEARS TWENTY

01:19:41.977 --> 01:19:42.544
FOURTEEN TWENTY FIFTEEN THAT WAS

01:19:42.611 --> 01:19:43.612
ALSO A REQUIREMENT.

01:19:43.678 --> 01:19:45.347
UNDER PROPOSITION --

01:19:45.413 --> 01:19:46.648
TWO BUT THE ONE TEST THAT WE

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:48.049
HAVEN'T MET YET IS THAT THE

01:19:48.116 --> 01:19:50.218
PROPOSITION ONE LEVEL HAS TO BE

01:19:50.285 --> 01:19:52.854
HIGHER THAN THE PROPOSITION TWO

01:19:52.921 --> 01:19:54.256
LEVEL BY GETTING THAT RIGHT

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:54.956
JESSICA.

01:19:55.023 --> 01:19:58.293
YEAH SO THAT'S THE TEST THAT'S

01:19:58.360 --> 01:19:59.694
NOT NOT THIS YEAR AND THE WAY

01:19:59.761 --> 01:20:03.431
COLLATION WORKS WHICH IS BASED

01:20:03.498 --> 01:20:04.099
ON THE GROWTH AND PERSONAL

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:05.133
INCOME --

01:20:05.200 --> 01:20:06.568
ITS FIRST WEIGHED AGAINST TEST

01:20:06.635 --> 01:20:07.669
THREE WHICH IS BASED ON THE

01:20:07.736 --> 01:20:08.870
GROWTH IN GENERAL FUND REVENUES.

01:20:08.937 --> 01:20:10.939
DONE TAKE THE LOWER OF THOSE TWO

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:13.441
TESTS AND PUT IT UP AGAINST TEST

01:20:13.508 --> 01:20:14.876
ONE WHICH IS OVERALL PERCENTAGE

01:20:14.943 --> 01:20:16.444
OF GENERAL FUND REVENUE --

01:20:16.511 --> 01:20:17.913
SO IT TURNS OUT THAT IN THIS

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:20.882
YEAR OUR TEST ONE LEVEL IS

01:20:20.949 --> 01:20:22.184
HIGHER THAN --

01:20:22.250 --> 01:20:25.620
THAT TEST THREE LEVEL BUT

01:20:25.687 --> 01:20:28.156
LOWERED SOME SORRY.

01:20:28.223 --> 01:20:29.257
AM I GETTING THIS RIGHT HIGHER

01:20:29.324 --> 01:20:30.792
THAN THE TEST THREE LEVEL BUT

01:20:30.859 --> 01:20:31.426
STILL LOWER THAN THE TEST TO

01:20:31.493 --> 01:20:32.527
LEVEL SO FOR THOSE REASONS NO

01:20:32.594 --> 01:20:33.461
DEPOSIT IS MANDATED.

01:20:33.528 --> 01:20:35.197
NOW YOU COULD ARGUE --

01:20:35.263 --> 01:20:36.131
SIMILAR TO SOME OF THE

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:37.799
SUPPLEMENTAL DEPOSITS THAT HAVE

01:20:37.866 --> 01:20:39.434
BEEN HAPPENING IN THE PAST FOR

01:20:39.501 --> 01:20:40.902
PROPOSITION TWO WHICH WE ARE NOW

01:20:40.969 --> 01:20:43.305
CHARACTERIZING AS MORE OPTIONAL --

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:44.839
YOU COULD ARGUE WE CAN MAKE AN

01:20:44.906 --> 01:20:46.141
OPTIONAL DEPOSIT INTO THIS

01:20:46.208 --> 01:20:47.909
ACCOUNT IN THIS YEAR AND THAT

01:20:47.976 --> 01:20:49.144
CERTAINLY WOULD BE OFFERED THE

01:20:49.211 --> 01:20:50.745
IMPACT OF ANY FUTURE --

01:20:50.812 --> 01:20:52.480
RECESSION I THINK WHAT THE

01:20:52.547 --> 01:20:53.949
ADMINISTRATION HAS THAT

01:20:54.015 --> 01:20:55.417
DETERMINE A WE FOR NOW IS THAT

01:20:55.483 --> 01:20:57.185
SCHOOLS EVEN WITH THIS MAJOR

01:20:57.252 --> 01:20:58.787
INCREASE IN K. TWELVE FUNDING.

01:20:58.853 --> 01:21:00.589
OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS ARE

01:21:00.655 --> 01:21:02.324
STILL UNDER A LOT OF PRESSURE

01:21:02.390 --> 01:21:03.925
AND OF COURSE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF

01:21:03.992 --> 01:21:05.794
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN LOS ANGELES --

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.329
SO THERE IS AN EMPHASIS RIGHT

01:21:07.395 --> 01:21:08.630
NOW AND GETTING AL THOSE FUNDS

01:21:08.697 --> 01:21:10.398
INTO THE HANDS OF SCHOOLS RIGHT

01:21:10.465 --> 01:21:12.267
NOW WE ARE AWARE THAT THAT THIS

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:13.702
IS AN ISSUE THAT WE WILL HAVE TO

01:21:13.768 --> 01:21:15.170
DEAL WITH INCREASING THE BASE.

01:21:15.237 --> 01:21:17.806
BASE LEVEL GRANT AND THINGS LIKE

01:21:17.872 --> 01:21:21.576
THAT IT FINDS ACT THAT MINIMUM

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:22.677
GUARANTEE LEVEL --

01:21:22.744 --> 01:21:24.479
BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT ARE THREE

01:21:24.546 --> 01:21:25.480
BILLION DOLLAR PAYMENT TO CAL

01:21:25.547 --> 01:21:27.382
STIRS WHILE OUTSIDE OF THE BASS

01:21:27.449 --> 01:21:28.984
GRANT PROVIDES AN ADDITIONAL

01:21:29.050 --> 01:21:31.319
LEVEL OF SUPPORT TO THE TUNE OF

01:21:31.386 --> 01:21:31.886
THREE HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

01:21:31.953 --> 01:21:32.887
DOLLARS IN EACH OF THE NEXT TWO

01:21:32.954 --> 01:21:33.288
YEARS.

01:21:33.355 --> 01:21:34.456
I'M SURE MY COLLEAGUES WILL HAVE

01:21:34.522 --> 01:21:35.824
MORE QUESTIONS AND THEN I'LL

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.158
LEAVE THAT TO THEM I HAVE TO

01:21:37.225 --> 01:21:38.260
HOPEFULLY QUICK QUESTIONS ON

01:21:38.326 --> 01:21:39.427
HEALTH CARE SINCE I WILL NOT

01:21:39.494 --> 01:21:41.663
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO VISIT

01:21:41.730 --> 01:21:42.831
WITH YOU IN A SUBCOMMITTEE ON

01:21:42.897 --> 01:21:44.366
THIS YOU MENTIONED CHANGES TO

01:21:44.432 --> 01:21:45.734
THE MECHANISM.

01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:47.168
BY WHICH THE STATE PROVIDES

01:21:47.235 --> 01:21:50.005
COUNTIES WITH AYE HSS FUNDING

01:21:50.071 --> 01:21:51.039
AND THAT THIS MAN MIGHT.

01:21:51.106 --> 01:21:53.074
HOPEFULLY WILL ALLOW COUNTIES TO

01:21:53.141 --> 01:21:54.743
MOVE MORE MONEY TOWARD MENTAL

01:21:54.809 --> 01:21:56.111
HEALTH SERVICES.

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:59.014
AS YOU MAY KNOW WE HAVE A MENTAL

01:21:59.080 --> 01:22:00.415
HEALTH WITH SEVERAL FUNDING

01:22:00.482 --> 01:22:01.650
DISPARITIES IN THE STATE BUT

01:22:01.716 --> 01:22:02.617
CERTAINLY A MENTAL HEALTH

01:22:02.684 --> 01:22:04.085
FUNDING DISPARITY IN THE STATE

01:22:04.152 --> 01:22:05.954
AS A RESULT OF THE NINETEEN

01:22:06.021 --> 01:22:06.721
NINETY ONE REALIGNMENT.

01:22:06.788 --> 01:22:08.723
WHICH WAS BASED ON POPULATION

01:22:08.790 --> 01:22:10.091
AND CASELOADS AND THERE'S THIS

01:22:10.158 --> 01:22:12.093
WAS A THIRD FACTOR BACK THEN.

01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:13.795
WERE THE FUNDING IN THE COASTAL

01:22:13.862 --> 01:22:15.463
URBAN AREAS --

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.032
AS TENDED TO REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH

01:22:17.098 --> 01:22:18.600
BUT AS THE POPULATION SHIFTS IN

01:22:18.667 --> 01:22:20.068
THE CASELOAD INCREASES IN THE

01:22:20.135 --> 01:22:23.772
INLAND AREAS NORTH CENTRAL AND

01:22:23.838 --> 01:22:24.606
SOUTH.

01:22:24.673 --> 01:22:25.707
THE FUNDING ALLOCATION IS NOT

01:22:25.774 --> 01:22:26.741
KEPT UP WITH THE WITH THE

01:22:26.808 --> 01:22:28.977
POPULATION IN CASE OF GROWTH.

01:22:29.044 --> 01:22:30.045
WILL THIS --

01:22:30.111 --> 01:22:32.213
READING REALIGNMENT SO TO SPEAK

THERE'S THERE'S STILL BASED ON

THAT IS A CONVERSATION WHERE

01:23:16.191 --> 01:23:18.093
WERE OPEN TO I THINK IT IT

01:23:18.159 --> 01:23:20.228
DEFINITELY WILL REQUIRE --

01:23:20.295 --> 01:23:23.264
LOTS OF INPUT FROM FROM THE

01:23:23.331 --> 01:23:25.433

01:26:38.560 --> 01:26:40.261
WAS SIX POINT FIVE MILLION FOR

01:26:40.328 --> 01:26:41.963
THE FIRST YEAR AND FOUR MILLION

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:43.298
GOING FORWARD.

01:26:43.364 --> 01:26:44.799
I WAS WONDERING IF THE FIRST

01:26:44.866 --> 01:26:47.802
YEAR WAS TO BUY A QUICK MINUTE

01:26:47.869 --> 01:26:48.570
AND THAT'S WHY THAT YOU'RE WAS

01:26:48.636 --> 01:26:50.305
HIGHER IN THE GOVERNOR'S

01:26:50.371 --> 01:26:52.941
PROPOSAL IT INCLUDES FIVE POINT

01:26:53.007 --> 01:26:54.208
EIGHT MILLION TO PURCHASE NEW

01:26:54.275 --> 01:26:55.376
EQUIPMENT.

01:26:55.443 --> 01:26:56.844
SO I'M JUST WONDERING IF THAT

01:26:56.911 --> 01:27:00.715
WILL DO AND IS THERE MONEY TO

01:27:00.782 --> 01:27:02.116
MAKE SURE THE RAPE KITS ARE

01:27:02.183 --> 01:27:03.184
ACTUALLY TESTED.

01:27:03.251 --> 01:27:05.019
SO I DON'T HAVE THE DETAIL ON

01:27:05.086 --> 01:27:06.087
THAT WITH ME --

01:27:06.154 --> 01:27:07.622
BUT I'M GONNA TURN OVER TO ONE

01:27:07.689 --> 01:27:14.629
OF MY COLLEAGUES WILL HELP.

01:27:14.696 --> 01:27:15.363
THE AMAZON WITH PERMANENT

01:27:21.636 --> 01:27:23.137
TIME PURCHASE OF EQUIPMENT --

01:27:23.204 --> 01:27:25.073

SCHEDULE FROM THEM --

01:27:33.014 --> 01:27:34.349

01:28:52.427 --> 01:28:53.227
THINGS IN THE ECONOMY.

01:28:56.497 --> 01:28:58.599
YIELD CURVE SINGLE AT SIGNALS

01:28:58.666 --> 01:28:59.167
THAT WE'VE GOT TO BE REALLY

01:28:59.233 --> 01:28:59.534
CAREFUL ABOUT.

01:28:59.600 --> 01:29:03.504

DOWN IF YOU NEED TO YOUR

01:29:07.975 --> 01:29:08.810
PROPOSED BUDGET BECAUSE YOU'RE

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:11.312
YOU'RE REALLY GOING OUT HERE.

01:29:11.379 --> 01:29:13.548
AND IN THE HOW HOW DO YOU SCALE

01:29:13.614 --> 01:29:15.383
IT DOWN YOU GO LIKE 10% EACH

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:15.683
CATEGORY --

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:18.653
HERE'S PROGRAM A THAT WE'RE

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.322
GONNA DROP BABY DO IT ANY YEAR

01:29:21.389 --> 01:29:23.624
TO OUR PROGRAM BE IS GONNA BE

01:29:23.691 --> 01:29:25.960
ELIMINATED DO YOU HAVE A A

01:29:26.027 --> 01:29:27.128
PRIORITY SYSTEM.

01:29:27.195 --> 01:29:28.062
SO NOT A DIRECT SYSTEM RIGHT NOW

01:29:28.129 --> 01:29:28.763
I THINK THE ONE THING THAT WE BE

01:29:28.830 --> 01:29:30.131
WILL BE WATCHING FOR OTHER THEN

01:29:30.198 --> 01:29:31.999
YOU KNOW CLOSELY MONITORING IN

01:29:32.066 --> 01:29:33.234
JANUARY IS A BIG.

01:29:33.301 --> 01:29:35.002
CASH MONTH AND IT'S IT'S HARD TO

01:29:35.069 --> 01:29:36.304
COMPARE THIS LAST DECEMBER TO

01:29:36.370 --> 01:29:38.072
THE PREVIOUS DECEMBER BECAUSE OF

01:29:38.139 --> 01:29:39.807
THE FEDERAL TAX LAW A LOT OF

01:29:39.874 --> 01:29:41.342
PEOPLE PREPAID THEIR PRIOR YOUR

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:41.976
TAXES IN.

01:29:42.043 --> 01:29:44.378
DECEMBER SO THE DECEMBER TWENTY

01:29:44.445 --> 01:29:44.946
SEVENTEEN REVENUES ARE MUCH

01:29:45.012 --> 01:29:46.948
HIGHER THAN DECEMBER TWENTY

01:29:47.014 --> 01:29:47.749
EIGHTEEN SO WE'LL BE WATCHING

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:49.050
THE CASH SITUATION.

01:29:49.117 --> 01:29:50.518
THIS CLOSELY I GUESS WE DON'T

01:29:50.585 --> 01:29:53.755
HAVE A HIGHER THIS POINT THE ONE

01:29:53.821 --> 01:29:54.522
THING THAT WILL BE LOOKING AT

01:29:54.589 --> 01:29:56.090
WHICH I THINK YOU ALLUDED TO AS

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:57.225
WELL AS YOU KNOW THERE'S ALL

01:29:57.291 --> 01:29:58.760
THESE BIG PROPOSALS BUT THEY ARE

01:29:58.826 --> 01:30:00.128
IN THESE ONE TIME AN ON GOING

01:30:00.194 --> 01:30:01.195
SPENDINGS.

01:30:01.262 --> 01:30:02.630
SO ANY CHANGE IN THE REVENUE

01:30:02.697 --> 01:30:04.599
PICTURE WERE ALSO AS WE UPDATE

01:30:04.665 --> 01:30:06.100
OUR FORECAST CAN TRY TO GET A

01:30:06.167 --> 01:30:08.136
SENSE OF HOW MUCH OF THAT NEEDS

01:30:08.202 --> 01:30:09.570
TO BE REDUCTIONS IN A ONE TIME.

01:30:09.637 --> 01:30:11.072
VERSUS HOW MUCH NEEDS TO BE ANY

01:30:11.139 --> 01:30:12.173
CHANGES IN THESE ONGOING

01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:13.741
CATEGORIES THAT ARE THESE

01:30:13.808 --> 01:30:15.443
BROADER COMMITMENTS IN THERE FOR

01:30:15.510 --> 01:30:16.477
A LITTLE BIT HARDER TO HEAR BACK

01:30:16.544 --> 01:30:18.246
BECAUSE THAT CASCADES OVER MANY

01:30:18.312 --> 01:30:19.280
YEARS.

01:30:19.347 --> 01:30:20.515
ACT IT'S GREAT TO BRING IT ALL

01:30:20.581 --> 01:30:22.517

01:30:40.701 --> 01:30:42.136
OPINION SAYING WE COULD FIND

MORE.

01:30:43.938 --> 01:30:44.639
THEN THE MANDATED AMOUNT IN THE

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:46.674

WE BE DOING --

01:30:54.015 --> 01:30:55.950
A A LOT CHANGED TO CHANGE THE

01:30:56.017 --> 01:30:57.985
FORMULA SO THAT THERE'S MORE FOR

01:30:58.052 --> 01:30:59.620
THE SCHOOLS BECAUSE WE GOT L. U.

01:30:59.687 --> 01:31:02.690

01:31:02.757 --> 01:31:04.091
IN I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING IN HERE

01:31:04.158 --> 01:31:05.092
FOR THE FISCAL CRISIS AN

01:31:05.159 --> 01:31:07.428
ASSISTANT MANAGEMENT TEAM OUT OF

01:31:07.495 --> 01:31:08.729
KERN COUNTY THAT WOULD JUMP INTO

01:31:08.796 --> 01:31:11.132
A SCHOOL DISTRICT. TO HELP OUT

01:31:11.199 --> 01:31:12.900
BUT THEY'RE READY.

01:31:12.967 --> 01:31:14.836

PULL THE TRIGGER ON LAUSD AND

01:31:18.706 --> 01:31:21.042
THEN HOW DO WE HOW DO WE FINANCE

01:31:21.108 --> 01:31:22.043
ALL THAT.

01:31:22.109 --> 01:31:23.277
SO I'LL MAKE ONE OR TWO COMMENTS

01:31:23.344 --> 01:31:24.445
IN AND OUT JESSICA SHOULD CHIME

01:31:24.512 --> 01:31:26.914
IN AS WELL I THINK THE FIRST IS

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:27.548
YOU KNOW AS WE WERE DISCUSSING

01:31:27.615 --> 01:31:29.650
WHEN THE MANDATORY DEPOSITS COME

01:31:29.717 --> 01:31:30.218
FROM THAT ACCOUNT THOSE ARE

01:31:30.284 --> 01:31:30.985
WITHIN.

01:31:31.052 --> 01:31:33.554
PROPOSITION --

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:34.155
NINETY EIGHT AND SO THIS YEAR

01:31:34.222 --> 01:31:36.190
GIVEN ALL THE PRESSURES THAT TO

01:31:36.257 --> 01:31:38.292
MAKE SURE ALL THE MY NINETY

01:31:38.359 --> 01:31:38.960
EIGHT MONEY GOES DIRECTLY TO THE

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:39.694
SCHOOLS --

01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.629
THAT CAL STIRS ADDITIONAL THREE

01:31:41.696 --> 01:31:42.897
BILLION DOLLARS THAT'S OUTSIDE

01:31:42.964 --> 01:31:44.332
THE GUARANTEE --

01:31:44.398 --> 01:31:45.366
AND OF COURSE YOU KNOW YOU COULD

01:31:45.433 --> 01:31:46.667
PUT MONEY AND ARE OUTSIDE OF THE

01:31:46.734 --> 01:31:48.469
GUARANTEE BUT AS YOU KNOW

01:31:48.536 --> 01:31:49.804
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE'RE WORRIED

01:31:49.871 --> 01:31:51.606
ABOUT GROWING RISKS --

01:31:51.672 --> 01:31:52.506
RAISING THE BASE OF THE

01:31:52.573 --> 01:31:54.342
GUARANTEE ANY YEAR LIKE THIS --

01:31:54.408 --> 01:31:55.610
CAN BE VERY BENEFICIAL TO THE

01:31:55.676 --> 01:31:57.745
SCHOOLS BUT CAN COME WITH RISKS

01:31:57.812 --> 01:31:59.347
TO THE BUDGET IN FUTURE YEARS.

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:00.448
COMPARE TO SPENDING MONEY AND

01:32:00.514 --> 01:32:01.549
GETTING AT THE MONEY TO THE

01:32:01.616 --> 01:32:03.251
SCHOOLS ALSO BUT ALSO MAKING

01:32:03.317 --> 01:32:04.619
SURE THAT THIS BUDGET IN

01:32:04.685 --> 01:32:06.721
EDUCATION AND ACROSS ALL AREAS

01:32:06.787 --> 01:32:08.623
IS POISED TO WHETHER A DOWNTURN

01:32:08.689 --> 01:32:10.491
SO WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE TO

01:32:10.558 --> 01:32:11.525
RELIEVE THE PRESSURE IS THAT'S

01:32:11.592 --> 01:32:13.227
WHY YOU KNOW WITHIN OUR

01:32:13.294 --> 01:32:14.395

01:32:15.596 --> 01:32:16.898
EXTRA FOR SCHOOLS UNDER THE

01:32:16.964 --> 01:32:18.366
LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA

01:32:18.432 --> 01:32:20.268

01:32:21.702 --> 01:32:23.404
AVERAGE ABOUT AN ADDITIONAL

01:32:23.471 --> 01:32:25.106
FIFTY DOLLARS PER PUPIL --

01:32:25.172 --> 01:32:26.073
SO WE HOPE THAT MAKES A

01:32:26.140 --> 01:32:28.209
DIFFERENCE BUT IN ADDITION TO

01:32:28.276 --> 01:32:31.212

ADDITION IT'S WITHOUT LOGGING TO

01:32:41.589 --> 01:32:43.291

WE ARE IN CONSTANT CONTACT WITH

01:32:48.296 --> 01:32:50.431

01:32:52.900 --> 01:32:53.567
TEAM.

01:32:53.634 --> 01:32:55.336
AND WE BELIEVE THAT HIS CURRENT

01:32:55.403 --> 01:32:58.472
STAFFING LEVELS NEEDS --

01:32:58.539 --> 01:33:00.608
BUT WE'RE CERTAINLY ALWAYS IN

01:33:00.675 --> 01:33:01.108
CONTACT WITH HIM IN AND

01:33:01.175 --> 01:33:02.610
REASSESSING THAT --

01:33:02.677 --> 01:33:04.512
IN ADDITION TO TO WHAT MISTER

01:33:04.578 --> 01:33:06.580
BUSH ONE OF ON SAID --

01:33:06.647 --> 01:33:08.149
I'D LIKE TED TO JUST POINT OUT A

01:33:08.215 --> 01:33:09.050
COUPLE THINGS THAT'S DIFFERENT

01:33:09.116 --> 01:33:10.518
ABOUT PROPOSITION NINETY THIS OR

01:33:10.584 --> 01:33:11.786
THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY SEEN IN A

01:33:11.852 --> 01:33:13.487
VERY LONG TIME --

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:14.722
AND THE FIRST IS --

01:33:14.789 --> 01:33:16.490
OUR DEARTH OF ONE TIME FUNDING

01:33:16.557 --> 01:33:18.059
FOR PROPOSITION.

01:33:18.125 --> 01:33:19.360
NINETY EIGHT SO FOR A LONG TIME --

01:33:19.427 --> 01:33:21.629
WE WERE PAYING BACK THINGS LIKE

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:23.130
MAINTENANCE FACTOR AND SETTLE UP

01:33:23.197 --> 01:33:24.665
INTO PROPOSITION.

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:25.299
NINETY EIGHT AND WE ALSO HAD A

01:33:25.366 --> 01:33:27.168
LOT OF ONE TIME FUNDS THAT CAME

01:33:27.234 --> 01:33:28.502
FROM --

01:33:28.569 --> 01:33:30.104
ESTIMATES OF THE GUARANTEE

01:33:30.171 --> 01:33:31.238
TURNING OUT TO BE A LITTLE TOO

01:33:31.305 --> 01:33:32.306
LOW WHEN WE GOT OUR FOR OUR

01:33:32.373 --> 01:33:34.208
FINAL FACTORS REVENUES THROUGH

01:33:34.275 --> 01:33:36.043
IN PRIOR AND CURRENT YEAR --

01:33:36.110 --> 01:33:37.345
WE'RE ACTUALLY LOOKING AT

01:33:37.411 --> 01:33:38.112
REDUCTIONS --

01:33:38.179 --> 01:33:39.647
IN ONE TIME FUNDING FOR PRIOR

01:33:39.714 --> 01:33:40.748
AND CURRENT YEAR IN THE

01:33:40.815 --> 01:33:41.415
PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT

01:33:41.482 --> 01:33:42.483
GUARANTEE --

01:33:42.550 --> 01:33:43.851
INSTEAD OF INCREASES WHICH WE

01:33:43.918 --> 01:33:45.519
HAVE BEEN USED TO SEEING --

01:33:45.586 --> 01:33:46.854
AND WE HAVE PAID OFF MAINTENANCE

01:33:46.921 --> 01:33:48.856
FACTOR --

01:33:48.923 --> 01:33:51.959
ALMOST COMPLETELY AND OFF ALL OF

01:33:52.026 --> 01:33:52.960
OUR SATELLITE.

01:33:53.027 --> 01:33:54.695
SO A LOT OF TIMES WE WOULD USE

01:33:54.762 --> 01:33:56.564
THAT ONE TIME FUNDING FOR ONE

01:33:56.630 --> 01:33:57.865
TIME PURPOSES SUCH AS FOR

01:33:57.932 --> 01:33:59.500
EXAMPLE WE COULD HAVE USED ONE

01:33:59.567 --> 01:34:01.802
TIME FUNDING FOR PROPOSITION --

01:34:01.869 --> 01:34:03.704
TWO PAYMENTS INTO THAT THE PROP

01:34:03.771 --> 01:34:04.605
NINETY EIGHT RESERVE.

01:34:04.672 --> 01:34:05.906
ON BUT THE REALLY ISN'T MUCH ONE

01:34:05.973 --> 01:34:09.577
TIME FUNDING AVAILABLE THIS YEAR --

01:34:09.643 --> 01:34:10.878
AND IN TERMS OF USING WHAT --

01:34:10.945 --> 01:34:12.146
ON GOING FUNDING --

01:34:12.213 --> 01:34:14.281
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT PRESSURES --

01:34:14.348 --> 01:34:15.016
FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS A LOT OF

01:34:15.082 --> 01:34:16.150
SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUILD THEIR

01:34:16.217 --> 01:34:17.752
BUDGETS ASSUMING THAT THEY'RE

01:34:17.818 --> 01:34:18.452
GOING TO HAVE FULL

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:20.855
IMPLEMENTATION OF COLA FOR LCS.

01:34:20.921 --> 01:34:22.123
FIVE THAT REALLY IS A BIG

01:34:22.189 --> 01:34:23.591
PRIORITY FOR US TOOK THE BIT OF

01:34:23.657 --> 01:34:24.992
A BALANCE THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF

01:34:25.059 --> 01:34:28.662
MAINTAINING ON THE FISCAL

01:34:28.729 --> 01:34:29.230
STABILITY OF OF FUNDING FOR

01:34:29.296 --> 01:34:31.298
SCHOOLS.

01:34:31.365 --> 01:34:32.299
THERE'S ONE OTHER POINT THAT ALL

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:32.967
MAKE AS WELL --

01:34:33.034 --> 01:34:33.934
AND THIS GOES TO A POINT THAT MS

01:34:34.001 --> 01:34:34.702
TWO MADE ABOUT THE BALANCE

01:34:34.769 --> 01:34:36.570
BETWEEN BUILDING RESERVES AND

01:34:36.637 --> 01:34:37.972
MAKING PAY DOWN STATE SAVE MONEY

01:34:38.039 --> 01:34:39.140
IN THE FUTURE.

01:34:39.206 --> 01:34:40.307
AND THERE'S REALLY NO RIGHT

01:34:40.374 --> 01:34:41.976
ANSWER FOR THIS RIGHT SO THAT

01:34:42.043 --> 01:34:43.477
THREE BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE'RE

01:34:43.544 --> 01:34:44.945
SENDING TO CAL STARS ON BEHALF

01:34:45.012 --> 01:34:46.147
OF DISTRICTS --

01:34:46.213 --> 01:34:47.515
YOU COULD IMAGINE A SCENARIO IN

01:34:47.581 --> 01:34:48.916
WHICH YOU PUT THAT INTO A

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:50.484
RESERVE ACCOUNT WHETHER IT'S THE

01:34:50.551 --> 01:34:52.853
P. S. S. S. A. OR SOME OTHER

01:34:52.920 --> 01:34:53.654
RESERVE ACCOUNT AND THEN YOU CAN

01:34:53.721 --> 01:34:55.289
DRAW ON IT IF THERE IS A

01:34:55.356 --> 01:34:56.857
DOWNTURN IN THE NEXT YEAR THAN

01:34:56.924 --> 01:34:58.292
SECOND OR THE THIRD YEAR --

01:34:58.359 --> 01:34:59.660
BUT THE PAY DOWN HAS ITS OWN

01:34:59.727 --> 01:35:00.795
BENEFITS AND I KNOW IN THIS

01:35:00.861 --> 01:35:02.663
PRESENTATION I FOCUSED ON THE

01:35:02.730 --> 01:35:04.265
FIRST TWO YEARS BECAUSE YOU KNOW

01:35:04.331 --> 01:35:05.499
LIKE ALL OF US SCHOOLS WERE

01:35:05.566 --> 01:35:06.534
LOOKING AT WHAT'S DIRECTLY IN

01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:09.770
FRONT OF US AND HOW THEY CAN GET

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:10.204
THROUGH THE YEAR --

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:12.973
BUT REAL TWO POINT THREE BILLION

01:35:13.040 --> 01:35:14.942
DOLLARS IS ACTUALLY DEDICATED

01:35:15.009 --> 01:35:16.143
TOWARD THE OUT YEARS AND IT'S

01:35:16.210 --> 01:35:17.578
DIRECTLY DEPOSITED WITH CAL

01:35:17.645 --> 01:35:19.814
STIRS ON BEHALF OF THE SCHOOLS.

01:35:19.880 --> 01:35:21.115
AND IT ACTUALLY DROPS THEIR

01:35:21.182 --> 01:35:22.616
CONTRIBUTION RATE BY HALF A

01:35:22.683 --> 01:35:24.118
PERCENTAGE POINT SO IF THEY WERE

01:35:24.185 --> 01:35:25.920
GOING TO PAY EIGHTEEN POINT 4%

01:35:25.986 --> 01:35:26.654
OF PAYROLL --

01:35:26.720 --> 01:35:28.255
INSTEAD TO PAY SEVENTEEN POINT

01:35:28.322 --> 01:35:29.924
9% AND THAT'S IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:31.025
TWO THAT'S IN TWENTY TWENTY

01:35:31.092 --> 01:35:33.327
THREE ALL THE WAY THROUGH TWENTY

01:35:33.394 --> 01:35:33.928
FORTY SIX ONE WE ALL HOPE --

01:35:33.994 --> 01:35:35.796
THIS UNFUNDED LIABILITY FOR CAL

01:35:35.863 --> 01:35:38.165
STIRS WILL BE PAID OFF SO YOU

01:35:38.232 --> 01:35:39.333
KNOW THAT.

01:35:39.400 --> 01:35:40.234
IN A SAVINGS IN THOSE OUT YEARS

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:41.402
BY HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT IT

01:35:41.469 --> 01:35:42.903
MAY SAY SCHOOLS ON AVERAGE

01:35:42.970 --> 01:35:45.106
BETWEEN LET'S SAY A HUNDRED OR A

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:45.739
HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS A

01:35:45.806 --> 01:35:46.307
YEAR.

01:35:46.373 --> 01:35:47.842
THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:49.243
AS THE THREE HUNDRED FIFTY

01:35:49.310 --> 01:35:50.311
MILLION DOLLARS THAT SCHOOLS

01:35:50.377 --> 01:35:51.745
WILL SAVE IN THE FIRST TWO YEARS

01:35:51.812 --> 01:35:53.380
BUT THAT MEANS EVERY YEAR AND

01:35:53.447 --> 01:35:54.815
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE WHETHER

01:35:54.882 --> 01:35:55.983
SCHOOLS ARE HAVING A GOOD YEAR

01:35:56.050 --> 01:35:57.685
OR A BAD YEAR ECONOMICALLY IN

01:35:57.751 --> 01:35:58.886
TERMS OF THAT.

01:35:58.953 --> 01:35:59.753
STATE AND NATIONAL ECONOMIC

01:35:59.820 --> 01:36:02.123
PICTURE THEY WILL BE PAYING LESS

01:36:02.189 --> 01:36:02.790
TO MEET THEIR PENSION

01:36:02.857 --> 01:36:03.591
OBLIGATIONS AND THEY WOULD

01:36:03.657 --> 01:36:05.092
OTHERWISE HAVE TO PAY SO WE

01:36:05.159 --> 01:36:05.926
THINK THAT THIS CAN MAKE A

01:36:05.993 --> 01:36:09.430
DIFFERENCE OVER THE LONG TERM.

01:36:09.497 --> 01:36:11.465
AND I FIRM THAT --

01:36:11.532 --> 01:36:13.234
YOU HAVE ON PAGE OF FOR WE HAVE.

01:36:13.300 --> 01:36:15.035
THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN

01:36:15.102 --> 01:36:17.538
REVISED IN THE TWENTY NINETEEN

01:36:17.605 --> 01:36:19.340
TWENTY PROPOSED IN THE PACKAGE

01:36:19.406 --> 01:36:20.574
THAT WE RECEIVED.

01:36:20.641 --> 01:36:21.809
AND THE TOTAL EXPENDITURES ARE

01:36:21.876 --> 01:36:24.812
ALMOST THE SAME A HUNDRED FORTY

01:36:24.879 --> 01:36:26.480
FOR BILLION AND I'M JUST CURIOUS

01:36:26.547 --> 01:36:28.082
YOU YOU PROVIDED.

01:36:28.149 --> 01:36:29.850
SEVEN ADDITIONS TO THIS YEAR'S

01:36:29.917 --> 01:36:31.619
BUDGET ARE THEY ALREADY INCLUDED

01:36:31.685 --> 01:36:34.822
IN THESE TWO COLUMNS SO ONE OF

01:36:34.889 --> 01:36:36.624
MY COLLEAGUES CAN ELABORATE BUT

01:36:36.690 --> 01:36:38.526
SEVERAL OF THE BIG TICKET --

01:36:38.592 --> 01:36:40.094
ITEMS THAT WE PROPOSED IN THIS

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:43.531
BUDGET PAYMENTS TO CALPERS ARE

01:36:43.597 --> 01:36:46.066
ACTUALLY SCHEDULED IN THE TWENTY

01:36:46.133 --> 01:36:46.700
EIGHTEEN NINETEEN YEARS SO THE

01:36:46.767 --> 01:36:47.801
YEAR THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW

01:36:47.868 --> 01:36:49.236
INSTEAD OF THE BUDGET YEAR.

01:36:49.303 --> 01:36:51.038
AND ARE THINKING FOR THAT IS IF

01:36:51.105 --> 01:36:52.673
WE ALREADY HAVE THAT CASH IN

01:36:52.740 --> 01:36:54.775
HAND AND CALPERS PROJECTS AND

01:36:54.842 --> 01:36:57.111
INVESTMENT RETURN OF 7% PER YEAR

01:36:57.178 --> 01:36:58.679
ON ITS INVESTMENTS THERE'S NO

01:36:58.746 --> 01:37:00.381
REASON NOT TO GET THAT MONEY OUT

01:37:00.447 --> 01:37:01.715
THE DOOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND

01:37:01.782 --> 01:37:02.616
SCHEDULED IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO

01:37:02.683 --> 01:37:03.784
I AGREE.

01:37:03.851 --> 01:37:05.252
IT DOES LOOK KIND OF FUNNY IN

01:37:05.319 --> 01:37:07.054
THAT YEAR THE EXPENDITURES OR

01:37:07.121 --> 01:37:08.155
YOU KNOW THE RIGHT MUSIC THINGS

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:08.722
ARE.

01:37:08.789 --> 01:37:09.423
YOU HAVE A TWENTY ONE AND A HALF

01:37:09.490 --> 01:37:10.591
BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS FOR THE

01:37:10.658 --> 01:37:11.458
CURRENT YEAR ON THE ONE HAND ON

01:37:11.525 --> 01:37:12.626
THE OTHER THESE NUMBERS DON'T

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:13.894
SEEM TO BE CHANGING ALL THAT

01:37:13.961 --> 01:37:14.929
MUCH FROM YEAR TO YEAR.

01:37:14.995 --> 01:37:16.463
AND IT BASICALLY HAS TO DO WITH

01:37:16.530 --> 01:37:17.965
HOW THOSE PAYMENTS ARE SCHEDULED

01:37:18.032 --> 01:37:20.234
TO MAYBE WE COULD GET IT A

01:37:20.301 --> 01:37:24.738
DETAILED AT YOU KNOW.

01:37:24.805 --> 01:37:25.372
BREAK DOWN ON HOW THAT WORKS SO

01:37:25.439 --> 01:37:27.408
WE CAN.

01:37:27.474 --> 01:37:28.509
YEAH ASSESS THAT YES THEN THE

01:37:28.576 --> 01:37:29.977
LAST QUESTION IS YOU DID MAKE

01:37:30.044 --> 01:37:31.512
ANY COMMENTS ON HIGH SPEED RAIL.

01:37:31.579 --> 01:37:32.546
IT ALWAYS SEMS TO COME UP SO I

01:37:32.613 --> 01:37:35.583
JUST THOUGHT I'D GIVE YOU THAT

01:37:35.649 --> 01:37:35.883
[inaudible]

01:37:35.950 --> 01:37:42.923
OPPORTUNITIES YES.

01:37:42.990 --> 01:37:43.958
SO THE ADMINISTRATION IS

01:37:44.024 --> 01:37:45.693
OBLIGATED TO PUT OUT A OUTSIDE

01:37:45.759 --> 01:37:46.961
YOUR INFRASTRUCTURE PLAN --

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:47.795
THAT INCLUDES ALL OF OUR

01:37:47.861 --> 01:37:49.129
INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS --

01:37:49.196 --> 01:37:50.064
WHETHER THERE AND RAIL TRANSIT

01:37:50.130 --> 01:37:51.565
ACROSS ALL AREAS THEY WILL BE

01:37:51.632 --> 01:37:52.800
PUTTING THAT OUT AT SOME POINT

01:37:52.866 --> 01:37:54.635
LATER THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY --

01:37:54.702 --> 01:37:56.303
THE GOVERNOR'S PLANS HE STILL

01:37:56.370 --> 01:37:58.105
DELIBERATING --

01:37:58.172 --> 01:37:59.106
FOR THE FUTURE OF THAT HIGH

01:37:59.173 --> 01:38:00.040
SPEED RAIL SYSTEM --

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:02.743
WILL BE IN THAT PLAN SO IT'S NOT --

01:38:02.810 --> 01:38:04.011
THERE IS CURRENTLY AS YOU KNOW

01:38:04.078 --> 01:38:05.312
WHAT CONTINUOUS APPROPRIATION

01:38:05.379 --> 01:38:06.814
UNDER THE CAP AND TRADE

01:38:06.880 --> 01:38:07.781
EXPENDITURE PLAN --

01:38:07.848 --> 01:38:09.617
WE HAVE NOT WEIGHED IN ON THOSE

01:38:09.683 --> 01:38:12.453
CONTINUE SUPER BUT YOU'LL

01:38:12.519 --> 01:38:13.420
CERTAINLY HEAR FROM THE GOVERNOR

01:38:13.487 --> 01:38:15.356
AND HIS ADMINISTRATION ABOUT HIS

01:38:15.422 --> 01:38:16.090
THOUGHTS ON THIS OF LATER THIS

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:16.890
YEAR.

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:18.025
THANK YOU VERY MUCH BOTH OF YOU

01:38:18.092 --> 01:38:19.893
FOR YOUR GREAT PRESENTATIONS

01:38:19.960 --> 01:38:21.395
APPRECIATED.

01:38:21.462 --> 01:38:24.765
THANK YOU WILL HAVE SENATOR BAIL

01:38:24.832 --> 01:38:26.800
FOLLOWED BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE.

01:38:26.867 --> 01:38:27.534
MINIATURE --

01:38:27.601 --> 01:38:29.603
THANK YOU.

01:38:29.670 --> 01:38:31.338
FOR DURING THE HEARING AND AND I

01:38:31.405 --> 01:38:32.906
WANT TO HISTORICALLY.

01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:34.975
NOTE.

01:38:35.042 --> 01:38:36.277
THAT IS VERY RARE.

01:38:36.343 --> 01:38:37.711
THAT WE FIND THE LEGISLATIVE

01:38:37.778 --> 01:38:39.213
ANALYST'S IN THE FINANCE

01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:40.047
DEPARTMENT.

01:38:40.114 --> 01:38:42.783
AGREEING ON REVENUE ESTIMATES.

01:38:42.850 --> 01:38:45.686
AND SO SO I WAS SORT OF CURIOUS

01:38:45.753 --> 01:38:50.157
AS TO AND WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE

01:38:50.224 --> 01:38:52.359
AND THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS.

01:38:52.426 --> 01:38:53.661
THAT -- WE

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:56.897
HAVE TODAY VERSES THE METHODS OF

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:58.632
THE REVENUE PROJECTIONS IN THE

01:38:58.699 --> 01:38:59.767
PAST --

01:38:59.833 --> 01:39:01.802
BECAUSE THERE MUST BE SOME

01:39:01.869 --> 01:39:03.671
CHANGES OR IS THERE.

01:39:03.737 --> 01:39:06.640
ANY OBVIOUS DIFFERENCE IN TERMS

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:08.208
OF THE METHODOLOGY.

01:39:08.275 --> 01:39:10.377
OR DID THE GOVERNOR FINALLY

01:39:10.444 --> 01:39:13.480
AGREED TO THE LEGISLATIVE

01:39:13.547 --> 01:39:15.883
ANALYST'S MATH OKAY SO.

01:39:15.949 --> 01:39:18.485
I WANT TO HEAR I WANT TO HEAR --

01:39:18.552 --> 01:39:21.055
I I I THINK WE THEN AND THEN I

01:39:21.121 --> 01:39:23.257
THINK OVERALL THE PURPOSE OF THE

01:39:23.324 --> 01:39:24.858
QUESTION WOULD BE.

01:39:24.925 --> 01:39:27.861
IS THERE AN AGREEMENT ON LOOKING

01:39:27.928 --> 01:39:28.462
FORWARD --

01:39:28.529 --> 01:39:30.531
WITH [inaudible]

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:32.132
OUR ECONOMY.

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:34.601
AND REVENUE PROJECTIONS OF WHAT

01:39:34.668 --> 01:39:36.537
KIND OF SCENARIOS WE CAN EXPECT

01:39:36.603 --> 01:39:39.807
SO. TO COME UP OVER THE NEXT

01:39:39.873 --> 01:39:41.909
SEVERAL MONTHS AND HOW WE'RE

01:39:41.975 --> 01:39:43.911
GOING TO DISCIPLINE OURSELVES.

01:39:43.977 --> 01:39:44.878
TO TO EVALUATE THAT IN A PROPER

01:39:44.945 --> 01:39:46.814
WAY.

01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.215
SO THOSE ARE MY QUESTIONS ON

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:49.583
REVENUE ESTIMATES THANK YOU I

01:39:49.650 --> 01:39:50.784
WILL JUST TAKE ONE OR TWO POINTS

01:39:50.851 --> 01:39:52.186
AND THEN TURN IT OVER TO AJ

01:39:52.252 --> 01:39:55.155
pOF THE REVENUE THAT THE FIRST IS

01:39:55.222 --> 01:39:56.490
THAT MY BOSS KELLY BOSS OR THE

01:39:56.557 --> 01:39:57.524
DIRECTOR OF FINANCE --

01:39:57.591 --> 01:40:00.060
STARTED HER CAREER AT THE LA OUT

01:40:00.127 --> 01:40:01.562
AS THAT HER PREDECESSOR MICHAEL

01:40:01.628 --> 01:40:03.630
TELLING SO THEY WERE JUST AS

01:40:03.697 --> 01:40:06.233
BEING USED AT YOU AT THE DRAFT

01:40:06.300 --> 01:40:07.401
PARMA FINANCING THE LA --

01:40:07.468 --> 01:40:08.902
THESE NUMBERS ARE MATCHING UP

01:40:08.969 --> 01:40:10.237
AND IT ALMOST MAKES YOU IT MAKES

01:40:10.304 --> 01:40:16.176
YOU CHECK YOUR NUMBERS TWICE

01:40:16.243 --> 01:40:16.710
WHICH WHICH WE ARE KIND OF

01:40:16.777 --> 01:40:20.247
WONDER.

01:40:20.314 --> 01:40:22.082
SO I WAS GOING TO CHECK HIM

01:40:22.149 --> 01:40:25.018
THREE TIMES.

01:40:25.085 --> 01:40:26.887
USUALLY THERE'S A BIG FIGHT AT

01:40:26.954 --> 01:40:28.622
THIS HEARING.

01:40:28.689 --> 01:40:30.357
BETWEEN REVENUE ESTIMATES SUBMIT

01:40:30.424 --> 01:40:32.826
NOT TODAY I THINK THERE'S A LOT

01:40:32.893 --> 01:40:33.927
FASTER.

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:35.062
WHAT'S GOING ON AS AND THE

01:40:35.129 --> 01:40:36.497
SECOND POINT I'LL MAKE --

01:40:36.563 --> 01:40:39.032
WHICH WHICH TABLE I CAN DESCRIBE

01:40:39.099 --> 01:40:40.434
IN MORE DETAIL AS AS MENTIONED

01:40:40.501 --> 01:40:41.235
WE ARE FORECASTING --

01:40:41.301 --> 01:40:42.369
SOME SLOWING GROWTH IN A REVENUE

01:40:42.436 --> 01:40:43.604
THREE POINT 2% OR THE FORECAST

01:40:43.670 --> 01:40:44.571
PERIOD AND THEIR NUMBER OF

01:40:44.638 --> 01:40:45.005
REASONS FOR THIS.

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:46.774
FIRST IS AN EXPECTATION AT THE

01:40:46.840 --> 01:40:47.775
NATIONAL LEVEL OF A SLOWDOWN IN

01:40:47.841 --> 01:40:49.410
GDP GROWTH ON THIS IS A FUNCTION

01:40:49.476 --> 01:40:50.544
OF BOTH --

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.479
WHATEVER AFFECT THE AYE TAX

01:40:52.546 --> 01:40:54.548
REFORM IN DC MAY HAVE HAD --

01:40:54.615 --> 01:40:55.582
THEY MIGHT OF HAD A LITTLE BIT

01:40:55.649 --> 01:40:56.884
OF ASTIMULUS OR PERHAPS EVEN A

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:58.819
SUGAR HIGH THAT WEARS OFF OVER

01:40:58.886 --> 01:41:02.523
TIME NEW INVESTMENTS THAT SOME

01:41:02.589 --> 01:41:03.357
OF THE PEOPLE WHO DROPPED THAT

01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:05.292
BILL ANTICIPATED SO WE'RE NOT

01:41:05.359 --> 01:41:06.059
NECESSARILY GOING TO SEE THE

01:41:06.126 --> 01:41:06.827
GROWTH THERE.

01:41:06.894 --> 01:41:08.162
THAT SOME IN WASHINGTON DC MAYOR

01:41:08.228 --> 01:41:09.563
PROJECTED --

01:41:09.630 --> 01:41:10.764
WE'RE ALSO SEEING RISING

01:41:10.831 --> 01:41:12.599
INFLATION AND ALTHOUGH WHO KNOWS

01:41:12.666 --> 01:41:13.734
WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE WILL

01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:15.736
ACTUALLY DO IN THE SHORT TERM

01:41:15.803 --> 01:41:16.603
FOR ITS FEDERAL FUNDS RATE THIS

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:17.805
YEAR -- OVER

01:41:17.871 --> 01:41:19.440
A PERIOD OF YEARS THOSE INTEREST

01:41:19.506 --> 01:41:21.241
RATES ARE EXPECTED TO RISE AND

01:41:21.308 --> 01:41:21.942
OF COURSE AS ALL OF YOU KNOW

01:41:22.009 --> 01:41:23.444
WHEN INTEREST RATES RISE THAT

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:24.878
RAISES THE COST OF BORROWING AND

01:41:24.945 --> 01:41:26.280
THEN THE ECONOMY IS PROJECTED TO

01:41:26.346 --> 01:41:27.080
SLOW.

01:41:27.147 --> 01:41:28.348
THE LAST THING --

01:41:28.415 --> 01:41:29.883
WHICH CAN BE GOOD FROM A POLICY

01:41:29.950 --> 01:41:31.518
PERSPECTIVE BUT DOES IMPACT A

01:41:31.585 --> 01:41:33.821
REVENUE IS THAT JAY AND IRAN

01:41:33.887 --> 01:41:34.621
ASMAN SAN WHO'S OUR CHIEF

01:41:34.688 --> 01:41:36.590
ECONOMIST HAVE ALSO PROJECTED

01:41:36.657 --> 01:41:37.257
THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE A LITTLE

01:41:37.324 --> 01:41:38.592
MORE GROWTH IN THE MIDDLE OF THE

01:41:38.659 --> 01:41:39.893
INCOME DISTRIBUTION.

01:41:39.960 --> 01:41:41.195
COMPARE TO THE TOP --

01:41:41.261 --> 01:41:42.996
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING AT A

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.097
TIME WHEN TO ME THAT.

01:41:44.164 --> 01:41:46.066
DENSITY ECONOMY GO TO THE TOP

01:41:46.133 --> 01:41:47.534
BUT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW IN

01:41:47.601 --> 01:41:48.836
CALIFORNIA ARE TAX REVENUE

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:49.837
SYSTEM.

01:41:49.903 --> 01:41:50.871
IS PRETTY HEAVILY WEIGHTED

01:41:50.938 --> 01:41:52.439
TOWARD THE HIGHEST INCOME

01:41:52.506 --> 01:41:54.475
EARNERS SAID THAT IT'S EXPECTED

01:41:54.541 --> 01:41:55.876
TO MODERATE THE GROWTH OF

01:41:55.943 --> 01:41:59.847
REVENUE AS WELL AND WITH THAT

01:41:59.913 --> 01:42:02.749
ALTERNATIVE J..

01:42:02.816 --> 01:42:04.084
A GOOD MORNING JAKE CHAMBERLAIN

01:42:04.151 --> 01:42:06.220
A DEPARTMENT FINANCE --

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:09.256
INTO AYE A I AM THE HEAD OF THE

01:42:09.323 --> 01:42:12.125
REVENUE S. MEETING UNIT --

01:42:12.192 --> 01:42:13.727
SO REALLY WE'VE WE'VE BEEN

01:42:13.794 --> 01:42:16.630
FOLLOWING THE SAME MODELS --

01:42:16.697 --> 01:42:18.298
FIVE FIVE WAS I WAS --

01:42:18.365 --> 01:42:19.099
IN CHARGE OF THE REVENUE AS MANY

01:42:19.166 --> 01:42:20.501
UNITS UNDER THE BROWN

01:42:20.567 --> 01:42:22.636
ADMINISTRATION --

01:42:22.703 --> 01:42:24.605
SO WE WERE USING THE SAME MODELS

01:42:24.671 --> 01:42:26.006
REALLY WHAT'S CHANGED SINCE

01:42:26.073 --> 01:42:26.707
SPRING IS THAT --

01:42:26.773 --> 01:42:28.308
I SAID REALLY TWO THINGS ONE

01:42:28.375 --> 01:42:29.476
ALTHOUGH THIS DOESN'T LOOK LIKE

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:30.644
A RIGHT NOW THE STOCK MARKET FOR

01:42:30.711 --> 01:42:33.046
MOST OF THE YEAR HAS

01:42:33.113 --> 01:42:34.114
ADDITIONALLY --

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:36.383
WITHHOLDING HAS BEEN GROWING A

01:42:36.450 --> 01:42:38.785
LOT FASTER THAN --

01:42:38.852 --> 01:42:39.987
THAN WE HAD ANTICIPATED SO EVEN

01:42:40.053 --> 01:42:42.189
THE WAGE GROWTH HAS BEEN PRETTY

01:42:42.256 --> 01:42:43.323
COMPARABLE TO WHAT WE HAD

01:42:43.390 --> 01:42:44.925
ANTICIPATED.

01:42:44.992 --> 01:42:47.194
WITHHOLDING HAS BEEN OUTPACING

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.829
WAGE GROWTH WHAT THAT THE WE WE

01:42:48.896 --> 01:42:51.865
WE INTERPRET THAT HIS THAT.

01:42:51.932 --> 01:42:53.200
MORE THE WAY TRUTH IS GOING TO

01:42:53.267 --> 01:42:54.601
HIGH INCOME INDIVIDUALS.

01:42:54.668 --> 01:42:57.137
WHO PAY AT A HIGHER MARGINAL TAX

01:42:57.204 --> 01:42:57.871
RATE?

01:42:57.938 --> 01:42:59.907
AND SO WITHOUT THAT THAT'S

01:42:59.973 --> 01:43:02.809
THAT'S WHY ARE ARE WRITTEN FOR

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:03.977
CASES BEEN BUMPED UP.

01:43:04.044 --> 01:43:06.146
BUT WE DO NOT --

01:43:06.213 --> 01:43:08.649
LET'S NOT JOB GROWTH.

01:43:08.715 --> 01:43:11.985
PLEASE WAGE GROWTH WAGE NOT JOB

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.054
GROWTH WAGE GROWTH WAITRESS

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:15.389
RIGHT YES --

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:18.559
AND WE DO NOT WE DO NOT BELIEVE

01:43:18.625 --> 01:43:20.861
THAT IT IS SUSTAINABLE FOR THE

01:43:20.928 --> 01:43:22.462
ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THAT.

01:43:22.529 --> 01:43:24.498
THAT -- HIGH

01:43:24.565 --> 01:43:26.199
GROWTH -- IN

01:43:26.266 --> 01:43:27.768
THE IN THE HIGH INCOME HIGH FOR

01:43:27.834 --> 01:43:29.102
THE HIGH INCOME SECTOR.

01:43:29.169 --> 01:43:30.237
AND SO WE DO THINK THAT MORE THE

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.439
WAY TRUTH IS GOING TO BE GOING.

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:36.109
TO THE MIDDLE AND LOWER INCOME.

01:43:36.176 --> 01:43:37.344
LEVELS ARE ARE MORE MORE

01:43:37.411 --> 01:43:39.913
PROPORTIONAL SO WE DON'T.

01:43:39.980 --> 01:43:43.016
A STRONG WE TRUTH ADDITIONALLY --

01:43:43.083 --> 01:43:44.251
EVEN THOUGH WE HAD THE THE

01:43:44.318 --> 01:43:46.019
STRONG CAPITAL GAINS A STRONG

01:43:46.086 --> 01:43:48.589
STOCK MARKET THROUGH MOST OF TWO

01:43:48.655 --> 01:43:49.590
THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE DO EXPECT

01:43:49.656 --> 01:43:50.757
THAT WE DID EXPECT IT TO BE

01:43:50.824 --> 01:43:52.159
SLOWING IT IS ACTUALLY SLOWED

01:43:52.225 --> 01:43:54.261
MORE THAN WE ANTICIPATED SO.

01:43:54.328 --> 01:43:56.496
WHO KNOWS WORK GOES FROM HERE?

01:43:56.563 --> 01:43:58.532
BUT SO THAT.

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:01.501
THAT'S WHY EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE

01:44:01.568 --> 01:44:02.035
BUMPED UP OUR OUR REVENUE

01:44:02.102 --> 01:44:04.938
FORECAST BEYOND WHAT WE HAD IN --

01:44:05.005 --> 01:44:07.240
BACK IN MAY --

01:44:07.307 --> 01:44:09.309
IT IS INDEED WE DO ANTICIPATE

01:44:09.376 --> 01:44:10.877
RELATIVELY SLOW GROWTH FROM HERE

01:44:10.944 --> 01:44:13.280
ON OUT.

01:44:13.347 --> 01:44:14.581
SO I WOULD JUST ADD A COUPLE

01:44:14.648 --> 01:44:14.848
THINGS --

01:44:14.915 --> 01:44:16.850
FOR CONTEXT OF THIS CONVERSATION

01:44:16.917 --> 01:44:18.418
ONE IS THAT --

01:44:18.485 --> 01:44:20.220
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATES

01:44:20.287 --> 01:44:22.222
REFLECT AN INCREASE IN REVENUES

01:44:22.289 --> 01:44:23.190
IN THE CURRENT YEAR THE BUDGET

01:44:23.256 --> 01:44:24.691
YEAR EITHER EXCUSE ME THE PRIOR

01:44:24.758 --> 01:44:25.792
YEAR THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE

01:44:25.859 --> 01:44:27.361
BUDGET YOU'RE THE ACROSS THE

01:44:27.427 --> 01:44:28.161
THREE YEAR WINDOW.

01:44:28.228 --> 01:44:29.630
AND IN LARGE PART THIS IS

01:44:29.696 --> 01:44:30.831
RECOGNIZING.

01:44:30.897 --> 01:44:32.499
REVENUE AND THE ECONOMIC

01:44:32.566 --> 01:44:33.433
CONDITIONS THAT HAVE ALREADY

01:44:33.500 --> 01:44:36.069
TRANSPIRED SO IT IT'S NOT JUST

01:44:36.136 --> 01:44:38.071
ABOUT SORT OF A OUT YOUR ISSUE

01:44:38.138 --> 01:44:39.606
THERE IS SORT OF A BIT OF MORE

01:44:39.673 --> 01:44:41.274
KNOWN QUANTITY ABOUT WHAT WE'VE

01:44:41.341 --> 01:44:43.076
ALREADY EXPERIENCE PARTICULARLY

01:44:43.143 --> 01:44:45.245
AS A MISTER CHAMBERLAIN ALREADY

01:44:45.312 --> 01:44:48.348
MENTIONED IN THINGS LIKE STRONG

01:44:48.415 --> 01:44:50.584
THROUGHOUT. TWO THOUSAND

01:44:50.651 --> 01:44:51.585
EIGHTEEN WE ALSO SAW A PRETTY

01:44:51.652 --> 01:44:53.153
ROBUST JOB GROWTH THROUGHOUT THE

01:44:53.220 --> 01:44:54.521
STATE THROUGHOUT TWENTY EIGHTEEN

01:44:54.588 --> 01:44:56.256
SO SO THERE HAS BEEN GOOD

01:44:56.323 --> 01:44:59.159
EVIDENCE ODD TO THAT EFFECT --

01:44:59.226 --> 01:45:00.594
I LIKE YOU CENTRE BELL WAS ALSO

01:45:00.661 --> 01:45:02.629
VERY SURPRISED AT HOW CLOSE ARE

01:45:02.696 --> 01:45:02.896
REVENUE --

01:45:02.963 --> 01:45:05.198
ESTIMATES WERE --

01:45:05.265 --> 01:45:07.000
ADD TO YOUR LAST QUESTION IN

01:45:07.067 --> 01:45:10.037
TERMS OF PREPARING --

01:45:10.103 --> 01:45:11.738
FOR WHAT WOULD OCCUR IF REVENUES

01:45:11.805 --> 01:45:14.207
DID COME IN LOWER WE TO BRANDON

01:45:14.274 --> 01:45:15.709
A RECESSION SCENARIO FOR THE

01:45:15.776 --> 01:45:17.077
PURPOSES OF OUR OUTLOOK IN

01:45:17.144 --> 01:45:19.946
NOVEMBER --

01:45:20.013 --> 01:45:21.381
AND WE ARE --

01:45:21.448 --> 01:45:23.083
PLAYED OUT TWO SCENARIOS USING

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.317
THE SAME RECESSION AND THEIR

01:45:24.384 --> 01:45:26.319
FIRST SESSION WE USE RETURNED AT

01:45:26.386 --> 01:45:27.487
A MODERATE RECESSION --

01:45:27.554 --> 01:45:29.222
IT WASN'T IT WASN'T IT WAS A

01:45:29.289 --> 01:45:30.791
SOMEWHAT AKIN TO THE DOT COM

01:45:30.857 --> 01:45:31.992
BUST THEY'RE NOT QUITE AS AS

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:33.560
SEVERE --

01:45:33.627 --> 01:45:35.228
UNDER OUR ESTIMATES IN THAT

01:45:35.295 --> 01:45:36.530
SCENARIO --

01:45:36.596 --> 01:45:38.432
A THREE BILLION DOLLAR ONGOING

01:45:38.498 --> 01:45:40.333
AUGMENTATION WOULD BE ABLE TO BE

01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:41.735
SUSTAINED --

01:45:41.802 --> 01:45:45.005
IN TERMS OF THERE BEING ENOUGH --

01:45:45.072 --> 01:45:47.607
RESERVES TO CONTINUOUS --

01:45:47.674 --> 01:45:48.675
SPENDING WITHOUT MAKING CUTS

01:45:48.742 --> 01:45:52.145
THAT SAID OUR ASSUMPTIONS --

01:45:52.212 --> 01:45:52.345
DID --

01:45:52.412 --> 01:45:55.716
INCLUDE AT TEN BILLION DOLLARS

01:45:55.782 --> 01:45:57.718
OF THE SURPLUS THAT WE HAD

01:45:57.784 --> 01:45:59.252
ESTIMATED AND PUTTING THAT INTO

01:45:59.319 --> 01:46:01.722
RESERVE SO WE UNDER OUR AYE

01:46:01.788 --> 01:46:03.056
DOWNTURN SCENARIO DID.

01:46:03.123 --> 01:46:04.524
AS MAY OF A HIGHER LEVEL OF CASH

01:46:04.591 --> 01:46:06.326
RESERVES AS COMPARED TO THE

01:46:06.393 --> 01:46:07.627
GOVERNOR'S BUDGET WERE MORE

01:46:07.694 --> 01:46:09.296
LIABILITIES ARE BEING PAID DOWN.

01:46:09.362 --> 01:46:10.764
OKAY OKAY THAT'S INTERESTING

01:46:10.831 --> 01:46:12.766
THAT YOU'RE STARTING TO LOOK AT

01:46:12.833 --> 01:46:14.067
THAT I LIKE MORE.

01:46:14.134 --> 01:46:15.936
I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT THAT

01:46:16.002 --> 01:46:17.671
WE SPEND A LITTLE TIME ON NOT.

01:46:17.738 --> 01:46:19.339
THE REVENUE ESTIMATES TEAM TO ME

01:46:19.406 --> 01:46:22.676
THE WILL DRIVE THE SPENDING

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:23.944
COURSE SO --

01:46:24.010 --> 01:46:24.978
ADVENTURE I JUST HAD ONE MORE

01:46:25.045 --> 01:46:32.552
QUESTION THE THE GOVERNOR --

01:46:32.619 --> 01:46:33.987
A WONDERFUL --

01:46:34.054 --> 01:46:35.889
VERY PLEASED ABOUT THE HOUSING --

01:46:35.956 --> 01:46:38.158
ONE TIME FUNDS BUT THE QUESTION

01:46:38.225 --> 01:46:41.928
IS -- IS THE

01:46:41.995 --> 01:46:44.197
GOVERNOR INCLUDING.

01:46:44.264 --> 01:46:45.832
ANY ONGOING [inaudible]

01:46:45.899 --> 01:46:50.203
FUNDING. FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:46:50.270 --> 01:46:51.238
IT IN -- FOR

01:46:51.304 --> 01:46:53.607
GOING TO HOLD YOU KNOW JUST.

01:46:53.673 --> 01:46:56.209
STARTING TO DEBATE ON SP ONE

01:46:56.276 --> 01:46:57.110
WHICH OF COURSE I'M FAMILIAR

01:46:57.177 --> 01:47:01.381
WITH -- IF

01:47:01.448 --> 01:47:03.083
WE'RE GOING TO START TO DEBATE

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:04.451
ON I I THINK --

01:47:04.518 --> 01:47:06.052
IT'S KIND OF HARD TO DEBATE IT

01:47:06.119 --> 01:47:07.454
WHEN WE'RE ONLY TALKING THIS

01:47:07.521 --> 01:47:08.522
YEAR'S SERVE ON ONE TIME

01:47:08.588 --> 01:47:08.822
[inaudible]

01:47:08.889 --> 01:47:13.593
FUNDS. FOR HOUSING AND NOT

01:47:13.660 --> 01:47:16.563
REALLY ADDRESSING THE ON GOING.

01:47:16.630 --> 01:47:19.166
NEED FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING.

01:47:19.232 --> 01:47:22.369
AT OF COURSE SB ONE NINETY EIGHT

01:47:22.435 --> 01:47:23.870
NINETY SOME PERCENT OF THE FUNDS --

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:26.306
IN SB.

01:47:26.373 --> 01:47:28.642
ONE OUR FOR LOCAL GOOD WITH THE

01:47:28.708 --> 01:47:29.142
MONEY SO COULD THE LOCAL

01:47:29.209 --> 01:47:31.812
GOVERNMENT IS ACTUALLY ALLOCATED

01:47:31.878 --> 01:47:32.913
FOR THE MAINTENANCE.

01:47:32.979 --> 01:47:34.948
BACKLOG.

01:47:35.015 --> 01:47:37.317
THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG.

01:47:37.384 --> 01:47:39.820
AND I THINK IT IS PARTICULARLY

01:47:39.886 --> 01:47:41.254
CONCERNING THAT.

01:47:41.321 --> 01:47:43.156
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:44.624
HOLDING BACK MAINTENANCE BACKLOG

01:47:44.691 --> 01:47:48.461
FUNDS -- AND

01:47:48.528 --> 01:47:49.830
THEN THE OTHER CONCERN IS THE S.

01:47:49.896 --> 01:47:51.031
B. ONE REVENUE.

01:47:51.097 --> 01:47:53.800
PROJECTIONS WE GOT A NEW STUDY.

01:47:53.867 --> 01:47:56.937
FROM OUR ACADEMIC RESEARCH WE

01:47:57.003 --> 01:47:59.339
PUT MONEY IN ACADEMIC RESEARCH

01:47:59.406 --> 01:48:00.473
AND SB ONE WEEK WE'RE STARTING

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:03.810
TO SEE ALL THESE STUDIES --

01:48:03.877 --> 01:48:05.345
THAT SHOWS MORE INFORMATION THE

01:48:05.412 --> 01:48:07.514
REVENUE PROJECTIONS ACTUALLY

01:48:07.581 --> 01:48:09.749
INCREASE BECAUSE OF THE SP ONE

01:48:09.816 --> 01:48:13.220
REVENUE INCREASES BUT THEN AS WE

01:48:13.286 --> 01:48:14.421
START TO HAVE.

01:48:14.487 --> 01:48:16.656
A FEW ECONOMY IN OUR VEHICLE

01:48:16.723 --> 01:48:17.824
FLEET IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

01:48:17.891 --> 01:48:19.426
THIRTY FOUR MILLION.

01:48:19.492 --> 01:48:21.828
VEHICLES WE START TO SEE MORE

01:48:21.895 --> 01:48:23.063
AND MORE EFFICIENCY.

01:48:23.129 --> 01:48:24.898
OF THE RIVER ACTUALLY DROP SO WE

01:48:24.965 --> 01:48:26.766
ACTUALLY HAVE.

01:48:26.833 --> 01:48:27.167
REALLY --

01:48:27.234 --> 01:48:29.002
ABOUT A TEN YEAR TWELVE YEAR

01:48:29.069 --> 01:48:30.804
PERIOD [inaudible]

01:48:30.871 --> 01:48:35.108
OF TIME. TO ACTUALLY DEAL WITH

01:48:35.175 --> 01:48:37.878
THE MAINTENANCE [inaudible]

01:48:37.944 --> 01:48:39.613
REPAIR.

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:41.381
REHABILITATION BACKLOG WE DON'T

01:48:41.448 --> 01:48:43.283
HAVE AN ONGOING SOURCE OF

01:48:43.350 --> 01:48:45.118
REVENUE.

01:48:45.185 --> 01:48:47.087
WITH THE GASOLINE TAX IT DOESN'T

01:48:47.153 --> 01:48:49.723
EXIST IT'S FOOLHARDY EVEN THINK

01:48:49.789 --> 01:48:50.056
THAT.

01:48:50.123 --> 01:48:53.593
SO I I'M LOOKING.

01:48:53.660 --> 01:48:54.327
FOR IS THERE GOING TO BE AN

01:48:54.394 --> 01:48:56.329
EXPLORATION OF ON GOING

01:48:56.396 --> 01:48:56.630
[inaudible]

01:48:56.696 --> 01:48:58.765
REVENUE.

01:48:58.832 --> 01:49:00.800
THIS NEEDED TO THE DEAL WITH OUR

01:49:00.867 --> 01:49:03.670
HOUSING PROBLEM --

01:49:03.737 --> 01:49:05.538
AND THAT'S THAT'S KIND OF OF THE

01:49:05.605 --> 01:49:07.641
QUESTION.

01:49:07.707 --> 01:49:08.875
AND IS THE LA --

01:49:08.942 --> 01:49:11.077

THE FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET FOR

01:49:16.082 --> 01:49:18.485
HOUSING IS ONE TIME AND ALSO

01:49:18.551 --> 01:49:19.452
SEPARATELY I WOULD --

01:49:19.519 --> 01:49:21.354
WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE THAT --

01:49:21.421 --> 01:49:22.722
STUDY ON SB ONE WE WILL TEST

01:49:22.789 --> 01:49:24.824
WHAT IT'S DONE BY THE MINNESOTA

01:49:24.891 --> 01:49:29.729
INSTITUTE SO THE STATE AND WE WE

01:49:29.796 --> 01:49:30.997
WE ARE GOING TO HAVE A THE

01:49:31.064 --> 01:49:32.232
TRANSPORTATION --

01:49:32.299 --> 01:49:35.001
COMMITTEE HEARING.

01:49:35.068 --> 01:49:37.537
OF TO KIND OF GO OVER

01:49:37.604 --> 01:49:39.940
TRANSPORTATION.

WE'RE GOOD WE'RE GOING TO HAVE

01:49:44.544 --> 01:49:45.345
THE PROFESSORS COME.

01:49:45.412 --> 01:49:46.780
AND TALK ABOUT IT --

01:49:46.846 --> 01:49:50.116
ITS IT'S IT WAS PUBLISHED ITS --

01:49:50.183 --> 01:49:53.853
STOP BY THE MINETA INSTITUTE.

01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:56.189
ARE THE BEST AT PROJECTING --

01:49:56.256 --> 01:49:57.424
THE REVENUES SO WE SEE THE

01:49:57.490 --> 01:50:00.260
REVENUE IS.

01:50:00.327 --> 01:50:01.594
IS NOT A LIKE AN ON GOING

01:50:01.661 --> 01:50:03.229
PERMANENT REVENUE IS KIND OF

01:50:03.296 --> 01:50:04.798
LIKE HOLDS UP FOR A FEW YEARS

01:50:04.864 --> 01:50:07.200
THAT STARTS TO DROP STARTS.

01:50:07.267 --> 01:50:09.035
TO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IF YOU THE

01:50:09.102 --> 01:50:11.705
FUEL ECONOMY CARS GO. TO THIRTY

01:50:11.771 --> 01:50:13.139
FORTY FIFTY MILES.

01:50:13.206 --> 01:50:14.941
A PER GALLON AND MORE MORE

01:50:15.008 --> 01:50:18.178
ELECTRIC OR ARE ARE.

01:50:18.244 --> 01:50:20.213
YOU KNOW THE TIDE OF PETERS OUT

01:50:20.280 --> 01:50:22.916
THE GAS TAX REVENUE.

01:50:22.983 --> 01:50:23.950
SO I'LL MAKE --

01:50:24.017 --> 01:50:24.617
TWO QUICK POINTS AND THEN IF YOU

01:50:24.684 --> 01:50:26.119
WANT TO ADD ANYTHING ABSOLUTELY --

01:50:26.186 --> 01:50:28.288
THE FIRST IS WE DO HAVE --

01:50:28.355 --> 01:50:30.123
AND MISS T MENTION FOR OUR TAX

01:50:30.190 --> 01:50:32.192
CREDIT PROGRAMS THAT'S DESIGNED

01:50:32.258 --> 01:50:33.393
TO BE AN ONGOING CREDIT GOT

01:50:33.460 --> 01:50:34.694
PROGRAM THE FIVE HUNDRED MILLION

01:50:34.761 --> 01:50:36.429
DOLLARS IN TAX CREDITS NOW AS

01:50:36.496 --> 01:50:37.897
MISSED YOU POINTED OUT WE DON'T

01:50:37.964 --> 01:50:39.065
ACCOUNT FOR THAT IN THE BUDGET

01:50:39.132 --> 01:50:41.001
YEAR BECAUSE THE CREDITS ARE

01:50:41.067 --> 01:50:42.402
AWARDED AND THEN THE PROJECTS

01:50:42.469 --> 01:50:42.602
ARE.

01:50:42.669 --> 01:50:43.937
BILLS AND AND THE OWNERS OF THE

01:50:44.004 --> 01:50:45.405
CREDIT SEE THOSE BENEFITS OVER

01:50:45.472 --> 01:50:47.841
TIME SO DOES COST TO THE STATE

01:50:47.907 --> 01:50:49.175
BUDGET COM SEVERAL YEARS INTO

01:50:49.242 --> 01:50:50.210
THE FUTURE.

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:52.045
BUT WE ANTICIPATED OUR BUDGET

01:50:52.112 --> 01:50:53.847
PROVIDING THOSE CREDITS ON AN

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:56.216
ANNUAL BASIS --

01:50:56.282 --> 01:50:56.816
AND AS MENTIONED THAT'S THREE

01:50:56.883 --> 01:50:59.052
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR --

01:50:59.119 --> 01:50:59.986
INCOME HOUSING TAX CREDIT

01:51:00.053 --> 01:51:01.454
PROGRAMSAND EDUCATIONAL TWO

01:51:01.521 --> 01:51:02.355
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR A

01:51:02.422 --> 01:51:05.058
NEW PROGRAM FOR MORE MODERATE

01:51:05.125 --> 01:51:06.726
INCOME AND THERE'S LIKE A THE

01:51:06.793 --> 01:51:07.994
FOR THE CREDIT SHOULD YOU KNOW

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:09.629
EXACTLY SO THAT WAY UP IN REAL

01:51:09.696 --> 01:51:11.598
QUICK IT'S RIGHT.

01:51:11.664 --> 01:51:14.567
UNDER THE OF A BUBBLE THIS.

01:51:14.634 --> 01:51:16.136
RARE BURST ON THE CREDITS ITS

01:51:16.202 --> 01:51:17.604
PEOPLE ARE READY TO GO WITHOUT-THAT'S RIGHT AND WHAT WE'VE

01:51:17.670 --> 01:51:19.572
NOTICED IS THAT THE 9% CREDIT

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.274
PROGRAM IS OVERSUBSCRIBED BUT

01:51:21.341 --> 01:51:23.810
ACTUALLY THIS UP 4% PROGRAM

01:51:23.877 --> 01:51:24.644
WHICH IS A MUCH GENEROUSLY ON

01:51:24.711 --> 01:51:25.812
NOT SO MUCH WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:27.080
FOCUS OUR ATTENTION OVER THERE

01:51:27.147 --> 01:51:27.781
AND WE MAY.

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:29.149
RUN INTO THE SAME PROBLEM IN THE

01:51:29.215 --> 01:51:30.950
FUTURE BUT WE'RE HOPING TO MEET

01:51:31.017 --> 01:51:32.752
SOME OF THAT DEMAND AND THEN THE

01:51:32.819 --> 01:51:34.187
OTHER POINT I'LL MAKE --

01:51:34.254 --> 01:51:35.055
IS -- THE

01:51:35.121 --> 01:51:36.322
GOVERNOR'S BEEN REALLY FOCUSED

01:57:51.531 --> 01:57:52.799
TO HAVE A REDUCTION IN

01:57:52.865 --> 01:57:55.368
GREENHOUSE GASES GASES --

01:57:55.435 --> 01:57:57.737
WE CANNOT DO IT FOR OTHER WORTH

01:57:57.804 --> 01:57:59.572
WILD --

01:57:59.639 --> 01:58:02.608
EFFORTS I SEE THAT THERE'S IN TO

01:58:02.675 --> 01:58:04.477
WORKFORCE TRAINING [inaudible]

01:58:04.544 --> 01:58:07.046
LAUDABLE GOAL.

01:58:07.113 --> 01:58:09.115
THE WIDOWS AND ORPHANS FUND IS A

01:58:09.182 --> 01:58:10.216
LAUDABLE GOAL TO BUT WE'RE

01:58:10.283 --> 01:58:12.318
RESTRICTED ON THE GREENHOUSE

01:58:12.385 --> 01:58:14.987
GASES TO OUR CAP AND TRADE FUNDS

01:58:15.054 --> 01:58:15.788
TO REDUCE ITS --

01:58:15.855 --> 01:58:17.323
JUST FLAGGING IT UNTIL I CAN'T

01:58:17.390 --> 01:58:19.292
BECAUSE THERE'S ALSO TWO HUNDRED

01:58:19.358 --> 01:58:22.595
MILLION AND AB SIX SEVENTEEN

01:58:22.662 --> 01:58:24.197
WHICH IS.

01:58:24.263 --> 01:58:25.898
TALK AIR TOXIC IN CULTURE AIR

01:58:25.965 --> 01:58:27.166
POLLUTANTS ONE REDUCE THOSE BUT

01:58:30.670 --> 01:58:31.971
THIRTY TO CAP AND TRADE FUNDS

01:58:32.038 --> 01:58:34.474

GREENHOUSE GASES SO I'M JUST.

01:58:37.176 --> 01:58:39.378
FIGHTING IT JUST LIKE THE LA --

01:58:39.445 --> 01:58:41.247
TO SPEAK PAY SPECIAL ATTENTION

01:58:41.314 --> 01:58:42.482
TO THAT BECAUSE I THINK THEY'LL

01:58:42.548 --> 01:58:43.683
BE.

01:58:43.749 --> 01:58:45.151
INCREASED AUCTIONS FOR STATE

01:58:45.218 --> 01:58:46.986
VERSUS YOUR ESTIMATE AND THAT

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:49.188

01:58:49.255 --> 01:58:51.190
TO STRATEGICALLY SPEND THOSE TO

01:58:51.257 --> 01:58:52.892
GET THE BIGGEST BANG FOR OUR BOX

01:58:52.959 --> 01:58:54.594
BECAUSE MY COLLEAGUE TALKED

01:58:54.660 --> 01:58:55.127
ABOUT.

01:58:55.194 --> 01:58:57.163
THE ROAD MAINTENANCE WE HAVE

01:58:57.230 --> 01:58:58.798
TWELVE YEARS TO DO SOMETHING ON

01:58:58.865 --> 01:59:01.934
CLIMATE CHANGE AND I SAW SOME.

01:59:02.001 --> 01:59:03.603
GENERAL DISCUSSIONS HERE BUT I

01:59:03.669 --> 01:59:06.839
DON'T HAVE THE PANIC THAT I

01:59:06.906 --> 01:59:07.907
THINK.

01:59:07.974 --> 01:59:09.242
THE WORLD IS WATCHING CALIFORNIA

01:59:09.308 --> 01:59:10.576
TO TAKE ACTIONS ON SO THIS IS

01:59:10.643 --> 01:59:12.245
JUST OUR FIRST DISCUSSION.

01:59:12.311 --> 01:59:13.212

01:59:20.486 --> 01:59:21.287
WITH WHAT YOU SAID THAT IS --

01:59:21.354 --> 01:59:24.357
SPACE SPECIFICALLY FOCUSED ON

01:59:24.423 --> 01:59:26.259
PATHWAYS INTO WHAT WE BELIEVE

01:59:26.325 --> 01:59:27.927
NEEDS TO BE A LOW CARBON ECONOMY

01:59:27.994 --> 01:59:28.961
FOR THE FUTURE.

01:59:29.028 --> 01:59:29.862
JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT IT

01:59:29.929 --> 01:59:31.931
IS NOT A GENERAL JOBS

01:59:44.977 --> 01:59:45.578
HAVE THAT TO HAVE THAT

01:59:45.645 --> 01:59:47.513
DISCUSSION IS JUST IS JUST TO

ACTION AS ACTUAL REDUCTIONS

01:59:52.318 --> 01:59:52.518
RIGHT YES.

01:59:52.585 --> 01:59:54.654

TO THEIR TWO BUCKETS OF TEN

02:02:11.824 --> 02:02:13.793
MILLION DOLLARS I THINK BOTH ARE

02:02:13.859 --> 02:02:14.794
IMPORTANT AND NOT WILL DISCUSS

02:02:14.860 --> 02:02:16.729
EACH OF THEM ONE IS STRICTLY FOR

02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:17.730
EMERGENCY SUPPLIES YOU KNOW

02:02:17.797 --> 02:02:18.898
THESE ARE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED

02:02:18.964 --> 02:02:20.466
WATER RIGHT NOW WHETHER IT'S

02:02:20.533 --> 02:02:23.269
BOTTLED WATER OR AND VIRGINS

02:02:23.335 --> 02:02:26.072
TEXT WELL WATER SYSTEMS.

02:02:26.138 --> 02:02:28.441
AND THEN WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE

02:02:28.507 --> 02:02:30.776
THAT THESE WATER SYSTEMS ARE IN

02:02:30.843 --> 02:02:32.511
COMPLIANCE WITH STATE STANDARDS

02:02:32.578 --> 02:02:33.245
SO THAT THEY DON'T FALL INTO

02:02:33.312 --> 02:02:34.380
DISREPAIR.

02:02:34.447 --> 02:02:35.281
BUT THE BROADER QUESTION I YOU

02:02:35.347 --> 02:02:36.615
ASKED IS YOU KNOW HOW CAN WE

02:02:36.682 --> 02:02:38.117
MAKE SURE THIS IS SUSTAINABLE

02:02:38.184 --> 02:02:39.185
INTO THE FUTURE AND THAT'S A

02:02:39.251 --> 02:02:40.753
CONVERSATION THAT WE WANT TO

02:02:40.820 --> 02:02:41.921
MAKE SURE TO HAVE WITH THE

02:02:41.987 --> 02:02:43.022
LEGISLATURE WE KNOW THE PREVIOUS

02:02:43.089 --> 02:02:44.056
ADMINISTRATION.

02:02:44.123 --> 02:02:45.658
HAD THAT CONVERSATION WITH THE

02:02:45.725 --> 02:02:47.393
LEGISLATURE LAST YEAR ON HOW TO

02:02:47.460 --> 02:02:48.694
HAVE A SUSTAINABLE FUNDING

02:02:48.761 --> 02:02:50.429
SOURCE FOR SOMETHING YOU KNOW

02:02:50.496 --> 02:02:51.363
WHAT COULD BE MORE IMPORTANT IN

02:02:51.430 --> 02:02:52.465
MAKING SURE EVERY PERSON IN

02:02:52.531 --> 02:02:53.799
CALIFORNIA HAS.

02:02:53.866 --> 02:02:55.034
DRINKING WATER THAT IS SAFE TO

02:02:55.101 --> 02:02:55.935
DRINK -- AND

02:02:56.001 --> 02:02:58.003
SO YOU KNOW IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

02:02:58.070 --> 02:02:59.205
WE CAN.

02:02:59.271 --> 02:03:00.439
OUTLINED SOME TYPE OF FEE

02:03:00.506 --> 02:03:01.640
APPROACH IN THE UPCOMING BUDGET

02:03:01.707 --> 02:03:04.043
YEAR BUT WE KNOW THAT SOMETHING

02:03:04.110 --> 02:03:04.677
THAT WILL NEED TO WORK WITH ALL

02:03:04.744 --> 02:03:06.879
OF YOU.

02:03:06.946 --> 02:03:08.581
FROM MATTE ONLY DEPARTMENT

02:03:08.647 --> 02:03:10.049
FINANCE REALLY KIND OF SENATE --

02:03:10.116 --> 02:03:11.550
ANY BETTER I WOULD JUST MAYBE

02:03:11.617 --> 02:03:15.354
UNDERSCORE THE FACT THAT --

02:03:15.421 --> 02:03:16.388
THERE ARE TWO BUCKETS THERE'S

02:03:16.455 --> 02:03:17.757
TEN MILLION FOR THE EMERGENCY

02:03:17.823 --> 02:03:19.325
SUPPLIES THERE'S ALSO TEN

02:03:19.391 --> 02:03:21.327
MILLION DOLLARS FOR TECHNICAL

02:03:21.393 --> 02:03:23.629
COLO ASSISTANCE WHICH DOWN

02:03:23.696 --> 02:03:26.332
PAYMENT JUMPSTART OF THESE OTHER

02:03:26.398 --> 02:03:28.300
CRITICAL TYPE PROJECTS THAT.

02:03:28.367 --> 02:03:31.003
NEED TO HAPPEN WHILE.

02:03:31.070 --> 02:03:33.205
WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OF

02:03:33.272 --> 02:03:35.641
THE LEGISLATURE ON A SUSTAINABLE

02:03:35.708 --> 02:03:38.043
ONGOING A FUNDING SOURCE FOR

02:03:38.110 --> 02:03:40.079
THESE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES

02:03:40.146 --> 02:03:42.214
THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE.

02:03:42.281 --> 02:03:43.282
ASPECT.

02:03:43.349 --> 02:03:45.951
IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE IT A LOT OF

02:03:46.018 --> 02:03:49.288
THESE SMALL COMMUNITIES --

02:03:49.355 --> 02:03:52.591
NEED SOME ADDITIONAL EXPERTISE.

02:03:52.658 --> 02:03:54.927
TO OF DO THE APPROPRIATE NEEDS

02:03:54.994 --> 02:03:56.395
ASSESSMENTS.

02:03:56.462 --> 02:03:59.165
AND TECHNICAL WORK.

02:03:59.231 --> 02:04:01.167
NEEDED TO TO PROVIDE THAT SAFE

02:04:01.233 --> 02:04:03.369
DRINKING WATER THAT IS A A

02:04:03.435 --> 02:04:06.539
PURPOSE OF WHICH SAFE DRINKING

02:04:06.605 --> 02:04:07.740
WATER FEE.

02:04:07.807 --> 02:04:10.543
OF COULD BE APPLIED FOR A AND SO

02:04:10.609 --> 02:04:13.779
AGAIN THIS IS A A JUMPSTART. TO

02:04:13.846 --> 02:04:15.581
DO SO ONGOING EFFORTS. TO AYE

02:04:15.648 --> 02:04:18.784
AYE ASSET BECAUSE SOME YOU KNOW

02:04:18.851 --> 02:04:20.586
IT'S NOT LIKE ONE DAY THIRD THEY

02:04:20.653 --> 02:04:23.155
HAVE BAD WATER I MEAN WHAT

02:04:23.222 --> 02:04:25.157
CONTRIBUTES.

02:04:25.224 --> 02:04:26.192
TO THEM NOT HAVING SAFE AND

02:04:26.258 --> 02:04:27.860
CLEAN WATER IN THESE AREAS AND

02:04:27.927 --> 02:04:29.662
NOT JUST BECAUSE THEY'RE POOR.

02:04:29.728 --> 02:04:30.296
SO.

02:04:30.362 --> 02:04:31.397
WE UNDERSTAND WHAT IS REALLY

02:04:31.463 --> 02:04:32.832
CAUSING.

02:04:32.898 --> 02:04:34.834
THEM NOT TO HAVE SAFE AND CLEAN

02:04:34.900 --> 02:04:36.969
WATER THEN WHAT ARE WE GONG TO

02:04:37.036 --> 02:04:39.605
INVEST IN THAT'S MOST NEEDED TO

02:04:39.672 --> 02:04:42.074
ADDRESS THE THE PROBLEM SO.

02:04:42.141 --> 02:04:42.975
I CAN APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU

02:04:43.042 --> 02:04:45.244
AND I'M I'M REALLY GLAD THAT

02:04:45.311 --> 02:04:46.612
THAT'S BEEN INCLUDED --

02:04:46.679 --> 02:04:48.247
BE STARTED TO ANSWER THE

02:04:48.314 --> 02:04:49.849
QUESTION I THINK ABOUT THE

02:04:49.915 --> 02:04:53.886
ECONOMY AND YOU KNOW THE FUTURE --

02:04:53.953 --> 02:04:55.821
IT SOUNDED VERY DOOMSDAY AND

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:57.923
PEOPLE SEEM TO LIKE OKAY WELL WE

02:04:57.990 --> 02:05:00.860
HAVE TO HAVE A BAD ECONOMY EVERY

02:05:00.926 --> 02:05:01.961
TEN YEARS OR WHICH SAID THINGS

02:05:02.027 --> 02:05:03.162
HAVE TO GO.

02:05:03.229 --> 02:05:07.266
AS IF IT WAS JUST ON A NORMAL

02:05:07.333 --> 02:05:09.401
BUT CALIFORNIA DOESN'T JUST GO

02:05:09.468 --> 02:05:10.502
THROUGH WHAT THE REST OF THE

02:05:10.569 --> 02:05:12.271
COUNTRY'S NORMAL NATURAL CYCLE

02:05:12.338 --> 02:05:14.673
IS WE THINK DIFFERENT WHERE

02:05:14.740 --> 02:05:15.074
WE'RE AHEAD OF IT.

02:05:15.140 --> 02:05:17.276
SO -- I

02:05:17.343 --> 02:05:19.511
THINK IN TERMS OF PROGRESSIVE

02:05:19.578 --> 02:05:22.348
ECONOMIC IDEAS SO THAT.

02:05:22.414 --> 02:05:23.616
PEOPLE ARE JUST BEGINNING TO

02:05:23.682 --> 02:05:25.351
SAVE [inaudible]

02:05:25.417 --> 02:05:30.189
BECAUSE IT'S DOOMSDAY IS UPON US

02:05:30.256 --> 02:05:32.892
BUT WE ACTUALLY ON THE CONTRARY

02:05:32.958 --> 02:05:35.494
ARE PROACTIVE IN INVESTING WHAT.%

02:05:35.561 --> 02:05:38.163
ARE FUNDS IN WHAT WILL.

02:05:38.230 --> 02:05:41.634
PROTECT US AND IN FACT KEEP US

02:05:41.700 --> 02:05:44.103
IN A IN A GROWTH ECONOMY --

02:05:44.169 --> 02:05:45.738
SO IF THERE'S ANYTHING YOU COULD

02:05:45.804 --> 02:05:47.673
ADD TO THAT BUT THE OTHER

02:05:47.740 --> 02:05:50.142
QUESTION IS --

02:05:50.209 --> 02:05:51.577
HOW ALL OF THIS MONEY

02:05:51.644 --> 02:05:53.412
CONTRIBUTES TO THE ECONOMY IN

02:05:53.479 --> 02:05:55.748
THE WELL BEING THROUGH GOOD JOBS?

02:05:55.814 --> 02:05:58.984
SO IS THERE A CONNECTION AS YOU

02:05:59.051 --> 02:06:01.921
DO ALL OF THIS BUDGET --

02:06:01.987 --> 02:06:03.489
TO HOW MANY JOBS ARE CREATED.

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:05.891
BY OUR INVESTMENT BY OUR

02:06:05.958 --> 02:06:08.761
SPENDING AND THE THAT KIND OF

02:06:08.827 --> 02:06:10.763
GOOD JOBS BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT WE

02:06:10.829 --> 02:06:12.531
WANT TO DO RIGHT WE WANT MORE

02:06:12.598 --> 02:06:14.199
PEOPLE TO GO FROM.

02:06:14.266 --> 02:06:16.435
POOR LOW WAGE JOBS TO GOOD PAIN

02:06:16.502 --> 02:06:17.736
MIDDLE CLASS AND UPPER MIDDLE

02:06:17.803 --> 02:06:19.405
CLASS JOBS SO HOW DO WE

02:06:19.471 --> 02:06:21.373
CONTRIBUTE TO ALL OF THIS

02:06:21.440 --> 02:06:22.875
INVESTMENT I THINK.

02:06:22.942 --> 02:06:24.643
OUR RESIDENTS ACROSS THE STATE

02:06:24.710 --> 02:06:26.011
WOULD LIKE TO KNOW.

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:27.680
HOW ELSE TO MY BENEFITING NOT

02:06:27.746 --> 02:06:29.281
JUST FROM THE SERVICE?

02:06:29.348 --> 02:06:32.351
BUT ALSO CAN MORE JOBS OR CREATE

02:06:32.418 --> 02:06:33.719
MORE JOBS ARE CREATED AS A

02:06:33.786 --> 02:06:35.254
RESULT OF THIS IS THERE SOME

02:06:35.321 --> 02:06:36.388
SORT OF CONNECTION --

02:06:36.455 --> 02:06:38.090
ANALYSIS THERE.

02:06:38.157 --> 02:06:39.291
HUESO LET ME --

02:06:39.358 --> 02:06:40.259
TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT BOTH OF

02:06:40.326 --> 02:06:41.126
THOSE --

02:06:41.193 --> 02:06:42.861
POINTS ON THE FIRST YOU'RE

02:06:42.928 --> 02:06:44.563
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THAT ECONOMIC

02:06:44.630 --> 02:06:46.065
ROSE DOESN'T NECESSARILY DIE OF

02:06:46.131 --> 02:06:48.567
OLD AGE AND THERE'S NO FORMULA

02:06:48.634 --> 02:06:49.935
FOR WHEN A BUSINESS CYCLE

02:06:50.002 --> 02:06:51.770
REVERSES AND YOU KNOW WE DON'T

02:06:51.837 --> 02:06:53.339
KNOW YOU KNOW WE ARE PREPARING

02:06:53.405 --> 02:06:54.173
FOR GROWING RISKS BUT THE TREE

02:06:54.239 --> 02:06:54.840
DAYS.

02:06:54.907 --> 02:06:55.874
NOBODY KNOWS --

02:06:55.941 --> 02:06:57.076
WHAT THE ECONOMIC PICTURE WILL

02:06:57.142 --> 02:06:58.610
BE THIS COMING YEAR OR THE YEAR

02:06:58.677 --> 02:06:59.878
AFTER THAT OR THE YEAR AFTER

02:06:59.945 --> 02:07:01.613
THAT AND I THINK YOU'RE ALSO

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:03.315
RIGHT THAT IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE

02:07:03.382 --> 02:07:05.250
SOME UNIX FRIENDS YOU KNOW NOT

02:07:05.317 --> 02:07:06.285
JUST THE OFT CITED STATISTICS

02:07:06.352 --> 02:07:07.219
THAT WERE THE FIFTH BIGGEST

02:07:07.286 --> 02:07:08.420
ECONOMY IN THE WORLD BUT?

02:07:08.487 --> 02:07:09.822
WE HAVE A VERY EDUCATED

02:07:09.888 --> 02:07:11.123
POPULATION --

02:07:11.190 --> 02:07:12.858
OUR PROPORTION OF IMMIGRANTS --

02:07:12.925 --> 02:07:14.159
FOREIGN BORN AMERICANS IN THE

02:07:14.226 --> 02:07:15.995
STATE IS ABOUT DOUBLE THAT

02:07:16.061 --> 02:07:18.797
NATION AS A WHOLE ABOUT 27%

02:07:18.864 --> 02:07:20.466
INSTEAD OF AROUND 14% FOR

02:07:20.532 --> 02:07:21.800
AMERICA I THINK THAT'S A SOURCE

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:23.202
OF STRENGTH WE CLEARLY PUNCH

02:07:23.268 --> 02:07:24.737
ABOVE OUR WEIGHT WHEN IT COMES

02:07:24.803 --> 02:07:25.437
TO INNOVATION --

02:07:25.504 --> 02:07:26.972
PATENTS PER CAPITA SO ALL OF

02:07:27.039 --> 02:07:28.540
THESE THINGS WILL PUT US IN GOOD

02:07:28.607 --> 02:07:29.575
STEAD -- I

02:07:29.641 --> 02:07:31.410
THINK THE ONE RECESS AND YOU

02:07:31.477 --> 02:07:32.211
KNOW WE'VE BEEN WE'VE CLEARLY

02:07:32.277 --> 02:07:33.145
PUT.

02:07:33.212 --> 02:07:34.446
FORWARD WHAT WE THINK IS A BOLD

02:07:34.513 --> 02:07:36.915
A PROGRESSIVE BUDGET BLUEPRINT --

02:07:36.982 --> 02:07:37.950
AS GOVERNOR YOU SOME SAID TO

02:07:38.017 --> 02:07:38.751
MAKE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM REAL

02:07:38.817 --> 02:07:40.686
ONCE MORE WE ARE STILL WANTING

02:07:40.753 --> 02:07:42.187
TO BE VERY CAREFUL BECAUSE YOU

02:07:42.254 --> 02:07:43.489
KNOW WE LOOK BACK TO RECENT

02:07:43.555 --> 02:07:45.157
HISTORY AND WE REMEMBER WHEN.

02:07:45.224 --> 02:07:48.560
OTHERS MADE SIMILAR ARGUMENTS IN

02:07:48.627 --> 02:07:52.598
THE NINETEEN THE BUSINESS CYCLE

02:07:52.664 --> 02:07:53.665
ON AND ONE THING THAT GOVERNOR

02:07:53.732 --> 02:07:55.667
NEWSOME WAS LOOKING AT AND THE

02:07:55.734 --> 02:07:55.868
LA --

02:07:55.934 --> 02:07:57.336
POINTED OUT AND ONE OF ITS

02:07:57.403 --> 02:07:59.271
DOCUMENTS IS THAT THE SURPLUS IS

02:07:59.338 --> 02:08:00.873
SO BIG WE HAVEN'T SEEN A SURPLUS

02:08:00.939 --> 02:08:02.775
LIKE THIS SINCE YOU KNOW

02:08:02.841 --> 02:08:03.709
NINETEEN NINETY NINE OR TWO

02:08:03.776 --> 02:08:04.743
THOUSAND AND WE ALL KNOW WHAT

02:08:04.810 --> 02:08:06.111
HAPPENED RIGHT AFTER THAT SO

02:08:06.178 --> 02:08:07.579
WE'RE NOT FORECASTING ANY SORT

02:08:07.646 --> 02:08:09.048
OF RECESSION AND WE KNOW WE HAVE.

02:08:09.114 --> 02:08:10.516
A LOT OF FRIENDS WE JUST WANT TO

02:08:10.582 --> 02:08:11.850
MAKE SURE THAT WERE CAREFUL SO

02:08:11.917 --> 02:08:12.851
THAT WE CAN MAKE THESE

02:08:12.918 --> 02:08:14.319
INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE BUT IF

02:08:14.386 --> 02:08:15.721
SOMETHING BAD WERE TO HAPPEN

02:08:15.788 --> 02:08:17.156
INCLUDING SOMETHING OUTSIDE OF

02:08:17.222 --> 02:08:19.191
OUR CONTROL INCLUDING A NATURAL

02:08:19.258 --> 02:08:20.959
DISASTER OF SOME TYPE --

02:08:21.026 --> 02:08:22.161
WE WILL BE READY FOR THAT --

02:08:22.227 --> 02:08:23.796
BUT ON THAT SECOND POINT THAT

02:08:23.862 --> 02:08:24.830
YOU MENTION ABOUT JOBS IN THIS

02:08:24.897 --> 02:08:26.231
IS A KEY PRIORITY OF THE

02:08:26.298 --> 02:08:27.466
GOVERNOR WE TALKED A LITTLE BIT

02:08:27.533 --> 02:08:29.034
ABOUT WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BUT

02:08:29.101 --> 02:08:30.803
REALLY THE WAY HE'D YOU SAID IN

02:08:30.869 --> 02:08:31.937
THIS BUDGET IS --

02:08:32.004 --> 02:08:33.639
CRADLE TO CAREER AND HE ACTUALLY

02:08:33.705 --> 02:08:34.907
JUST APPOINTED I DON'T BELIEVE

02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:36.408
THERE WAS A SIMILAR POSITION IN

02:08:36.475 --> 02:08:38.177
THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION BUT A

02:08:38.243 --> 02:08:39.778
SENIOR ADVISER ON HIS TEAM WHO

02:08:39.845 --> 02:08:42.247
FOCUSES SPECIFICALLY ON CRADLE

02:08:42.314 --> 02:08:42.981
TO CAREER NO THAT'S THE JOB

02:08:43.048 --> 02:08:43.515
TITLE.

02:08:43.582 --> 02:08:45.384
AND SO IT'S NOT JUST MORE MONEY

02:08:45.451 --> 02:08:47.019
FOR EARLY EDUCATION MORE MONEY

02:08:47.086 --> 02:08:48.220
FOR K. TWELVEMORE MONEY FOR

02:08:48.287 --> 02:08:49.588
HIGHER EDUCATION BUT IT'S HOW

02:08:49.655 --> 02:08:50.923
ARE THESE ALL LINKED TOGETHER

02:08:50.989 --> 02:08:52.591
AND HOW TO BE ALIGNED WITH THE

02:08:52.658 --> 02:08:53.625
WORKFORCE NEEDS OF THE FUTURE.

02:08:53.692 --> 02:08:55.694
ON THE GOVERNOR ALSO POINTED OUT

02:08:55.761 --> 02:08:56.528
HE WILL BE TAKING OFFICE NEXT

02:08:56.595 --> 02:08:58.430
MONTH BUT AS THE HEAD OF THE

02:08:58.497 --> 02:09:00.032
GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS

02:09:00.099 --> 02:09:04.436
AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT.

02:09:04.503 --> 02:09:07.473
HOW MANY MEN DON SO PROFITS THE

02:09:07.539 --> 02:09:08.774
NEW AMERICA FOUNDATION IT'S LIKE

02:09:08.841 --> 02:09:12.311
A LAYS HOW DO WE MAKE SURE --

02:09:12.377 --> 02:09:15.314
ARE PREPARED FOR NOT JUST ON THE

02:09:15.380 --> 02:09:17.382
COASTS BUT ALL ACROSS THE STATE

02:09:17.449 --> 02:09:18.383
IN FACT TWENTY MINUTES IT WAS

02:09:18.450 --> 02:09:19.518
THE COMMENCEMENT SPEAKER AT YOU

02:09:19.585 --> 02:09:21.019
SEE MORE SIDE ON THIS LAST

02:09:21.086 --> 02:09:22.020
SUMMER AND TALKING ABOUT

02:09:22.087 --> 02:09:23.288
EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES

02:09:23.355 --> 02:09:23.989
EVERYWHERE.

02:09:24.056 --> 02:09:25.424
SO THIS BUDGET IS JUST A DOWN

02:09:25.491 --> 02:09:27.059
PAYMENT ON THAT BUT DEFINITELY

02:09:27.126 --> 02:09:28.627
REST ASSURED THAT THAT WILL BE A

02:09:28.694 --> 02:09:30.395
PRIORITY FOR THE ADMINISTRATION

02:09:30.462 --> 02:09:32.197
GO FORWARD. NINETY SEVEN TWO

02:09:32.264 --> 02:09:34.266
ITEMS AND YOU DON'T HAVE.

02:09:34.333 --> 02:09:34.933
TO ANSWER THEM RIGHT NOW BECAUSE

02:09:35.000 --> 02:09:35.734
I WANT TO BE RESPECTFUL OF OF

02:09:35.801 --> 02:09:37.369
OTHER SPEAKING AND MAY BE JUST

02:09:37.436 --> 02:09:40.038
FOLLOW UP WITH OUR STAFF IS ON

02:09:40.105 --> 02:09:42.708
THE ISSUE OF MEDI CAL.

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.843
ON A NIGHT NOTICE THAT SOME.

02:09:44.910 --> 02:09:48.280
EXPANDED TO ABOUT A HUNDRED

02:09:48.347 --> 02:09:48.747
THIRTY EIGHT THOUSAND

02:09:48.814 --> 02:09:50.983
UNDOCUMENTED WANT TO SEE.

02:09:51.049 --> 02:09:51.984
YOU KNOW.

02:09:52.050 --> 02:09:53.886
WHAT WOULD BE THE ESTIMATES FOR

02:09:53.952 --> 02:09:55.888
A MUCH LARGER LIKE THE ENTIRE

02:09:55.954 --> 02:09:58.423
UNDOCUMENTED WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:09:58.490 --> 02:09:59.992
WE EVENTUALLY AFTER?

02:10:00.058 --> 02:10:01.660
COVER TWO AND A HALF MILLION

02:10:01.727 --> 02:10:05.898
UNINSURED SO THIS IS A COULD BE

02:10:05.964 --> 02:10:07.900
A MAJOR STP NOT JUST A GOOD

02:10:07.966 --> 02:10:10.536
STEP BUT A MAJOR STEP FORWARD.

02:10:10.602 --> 02:10:12.604
SO WHAT WOULD BE THOSE.

02:10:12.671 --> 02:10:17.242
THE COST WITH A GREATER.

02:10:17.309 --> 02:10:21.213
AND THE OTHER THAT LATER IS I

02:10:21.280 --> 02:10:23.615
WANT UNDERSTAND BETTER THE THE

02:10:23.682 --> 02:10:25.884
MCO TAX AND YOU MENTIONED THAT

02:10:25.951 --> 02:10:28.320
AND IN RELATIONSHIP TO WAIVERS

02:10:28.387 --> 02:10:30.055
WHAT THE FED SO.

02:10:30.122 --> 02:10:31.723
I JUST WANT TO GET SCHOOL DONE

02:10:31.790 --> 02:10:33.492
THAT AND UNDERSTAND THAT A WHOLE

02:10:33.559 --> 02:10:35.928
LOT BETTER BECAUSE BY PASSING A

02:10:35.994 --> 02:10:38.564
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:10:38.630 --> 02:10:40.365
IN REVENUE SEEMS LIKE.

02:10:40.432 --> 02:10:41.800
NOT SOMETHING WE COULD JUST DO

02:10:41.867 --> 02:10:43.235
EASILY AND I'M NOT SAYING YOU

02:10:43.302 --> 02:10:45.470
ARE BUT ANYWAY SO IF YOU COULD

02:10:45.537 --> 02:10:47.472
FOLLOW UP WITH US ON THOSE TWO

02:10:47.539 --> 02:10:48.907
ISSUES AND IF I COULD FACE AN IS

02:10:48.974 --> 02:10:49.942
IT AROUND SO I THINK I MENTIONED

02:10:50.008 --> 02:10:51.143
AT THE ON TO THE HEARING THAT

02:10:51.210 --> 02:10:52.744
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE --

02:10:52.811 --> 02:10:54.713
FOR MORE FULL BUDGET COMMITTEE

02:10:54.780 --> 02:10:56.648
HEARINGS AND ONE OF THEM WILL

02:10:56.715 --> 02:10:57.849
VERY LIKELY FOCUS ON HEALTHCARE.

02:10:57.916 --> 02:10:59.618
THE HEALTH PROPOSAL SO WE CAN

NUMBER ONE WHICH WE KNOW IS EACH

02:18:01.906 --> 02:18:02.941
UNIT.

02:18:03.008 --> 02:18:05.176
ESPECIALLY IN THE MOST

02:18:05.243 --> 02:18:07.712
CHALLENGER THE STATE DO NOT HAVE

02:18:07.779 --> 02:18:09.080
ENOUGH PERSONNEL TO BE ABLE TO

02:18:09.147 --> 02:18:10.015
COVER.

02:18:10.081 --> 02:18:11.016
NUMBER TWO BUT WHEN WE TALK

02:18:11.082 --> 02:18:12.150
ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH OF

02:18:12.217 --> 02:18:13.885
FIREFIGHTERS ON IT IS BECAUSE WE

02:18:13.952 --> 02:18:15.920
HAVE FIREFIGHTERS ON THE LINE

02:18:15.987 --> 02:18:17.589
SIXTY DAYS FORTY FIVE DAYS

02:18:17.656 --> 02:18:18.390
THIRTY DAYS.

02:18:18.456 --> 02:18:19.591
AND THE MORE FOLKS THAT WE CAN

02:18:19.658 --> 02:18:21.960
PUT ON THE BETTER SO --

02:18:22.027 --> 02:18:23.228
WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF ACRES

02:18:23.295 --> 02:18:25.397
BURNED SINCE TWO THOUSAND

02:18:25.463 --> 02:18:26.064
FIFTEEN AND WE ARE NOT EVEN AT

02:18:26.131 --> 02:18:27.766
ARMS NINETEEN SEVENTY FIVE

02:18:27.832 --> 02:18:29.601
LEVELS --

02:18:29.668 --> 02:18:31.136
AGAIN I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU

02:18:31.202 --> 02:18:32.704
FOR MOVING WITH THOSE THIRTEEN

02:18:32.771 --> 02:18:33.738
WHICH ALSO GETS HIS ULL TIME

02:18:33.805 --> 02:18:34.939
CREW -- BUT

02:18:35.006 --> 02:18:36.608
I THINK THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE

02:18:36.675 --> 02:18:37.876
TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THOSE

02:18:37.942 --> 02:18:39.744
ADDITIONAL EIGHTEEN ON WHETHER

02:18:39.811 --> 02:18:42.614
IT IS A TWELVE MONTH COMMITMENT

02:18:42.681 --> 02:18:43.181
TWENTY FOUR MONTH COMMITMENT

02:18:43.248 --> 02:18:43.815
BECAUSE I ALSO KNOW THAT

02:18:43.882 --> 02:18:45.350
CALIFORNIA'S TO FIGURE OUT.

02:18:45.417 --> 02:18:46.718
HOW TO BE A TO GET ORDERS IN HOW

02:18:46.785 --> 02:18:48.119
TO BE A TO GET STAFF TRAINED BUT

02:18:48.186 --> 02:18:49.821
IT'S SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH AND I

02:18:49.888 --> 02:18:50.055
WOULD?

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:50.689
HOPE THAT THERE'S GONNA BE TO

02:18:50.755 --> 02:18:52.023
SHOW CONSIDERATION AS WE MOVE

02:18:52.090 --> 02:18:53.758
FORWARD IN THIS BUDGET PROCESS

02:18:53.825 --> 02:18:58.296
THAT WE CAN GET BEYOND THAT

02:18:58.363 --> 02:18:58.930
THIRTEEN AND JUST WANTED TO SEE

02:18:58.997 --> 02:19:02.067
WHAT YOUR THOUGHTS ARE.

02:19:02.133 --> 02:19:06.171

SUBCOMMITTEE'S ABOUT THAT I

02:19:11.209 --> 02:19:11.976
THOSE CONVERSATIONS --

02:19:12.043 --> 02:19:12.544
WE'RE OF COURSE TRYING TO

02:19:12.610 --> 02:19:14.012
BALANCE OUR INVESTMENTS IN A

02:19:14.079 --> 02:19:14.512
NUMBER OF AREAS A FIRE

02:19:14.579 --> 02:19:16.481
PREVENTION AND FIRE SUPPRESSION

02:19:16.548 --> 02:19:17.148

AND IS IN THE ENGINES ARE AN

02:19:18.016 --> 02:19:19.117
IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION AS WELL

02:19:19.184 --> 02:19:21.753
AS OTHER THINGS BUT CERTAINLY

02:19:21.820 --> 02:19:25.523
OPEN TO CONVERSATION EACH YEAR

02:19:25.590 --> 02:19:26.424
BUT HE'S GETTING TO THE BUDGET

02:19:26.491 --> 02:19:27.358
FOR THIS YEAR AND THEN IN FUTURE

02:19:27.425 --> 02:19:28.593
YEARS BUT OVERALL.

02:19:28.660 --> 02:19:30.228
I COMMITTED TO CONTINUE --

02:19:30.295 --> 02:19:31.262
AND AS THE LA --

02:19:31.329 --> 02:19:32.163
SAD AND IN SOME WAYS IN THE

02:19:32.230 --> 02:19:33.064
MEDIA CRITICISM BUT ALSO JUST

02:19:33.131 --> 02:19:34.365
THE WAY THINGS ARE --

02:19:34.432 --> 02:19:35.867
SOME OF THE STEPS THAT WE'RE

02:19:35.934 --> 02:19:37.535
TAKING ON WHAT'S UP WILDFIRES

02:19:37.602 --> 02:19:38.403
ARE JUST DIFFERENT THAN THEY

02:19:38.470 --> 02:19:40.572
HAVE BEEN AND MORE RECENT YEARS

02:19:40.638 --> 02:19:41.773
AND ARE MORE ACROSS SAID IN

02:19:41.840 --> 02:19:43.475
TERMS OF THE PROPERTY TAX BACK

02:19:43.541 --> 02:19:44.209
FILL IN.

02:19:44.275 --> 02:19:45.110
SOME OF THE STEPS OBSTACLES ON

02:19:45.176 --> 02:19:46.377
EMERGENCY SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE

02:19:46.444 --> 02:19:47.312
THAT PATTERN WE THINK IT'S

02:19:47.378 --> 02:19:49.047
REALLY IMPORTANT NINE AND I SEE

02:19:49.114 --> 02:19:53.351
THAT SIGNAL AYE AYE INDIA AND

02:19:53.418 --> 02:19:54.953
TRULY IN.

02:19:55.019 --> 02:19:56.121
NOT JUST SAYING THIS BECAUSE

02:19:56.187 --> 02:19:57.122
YOU'RE HERE I MEAN IT IS

02:19:57.188 --> 02:19:59.724
FANTASTIC THAT WHAT WE SEEM FOR

02:19:59.791 --> 02:20:00.358
THOSE COUNTIES HAVE BEEN HIT AS

02:20:00.425 --> 02:20:01.693
HARD AND I ENTIRE DEPARTMENT

02:20:01.760 --> 02:20:03.061
FINANCING HAS BEEN WONDERFUL

02:20:03.128 --> 02:20:03.561
ESPECIALLY.

02:20:03.628 --> 02:20:04.929
WHEN YOU'RE ALL SO HANDS ON AND

02:20:04.996 --> 02:20:06.564
MAKING SURE THE COMMUTER ABLE TO

02:20:06.631 --> 02:20:07.665
RECOVER AND?

02:20:07.732 --> 02:20:08.800
WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT THE

02:20:08.867 --> 02:20:09.801
RECORD NUMBER BAKER SAID BURN

TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND WE ARE

02:20:11.336 --> 02:20:12.203
NOT VEN BACK TO WHERE WE WERE

02:20:12.270 --> 02:20:12.937

02:20:14.139 --> 02:20:15.573
ARE ON THE ROAD FOR CAL FIRE --

02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:16.775
I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO

02:20:16.841 --> 02:20:18.143
FOCUS ON THAT AND I KNOW THAT IS

02:20:18.209 --> 02:20:19.344
COMMITMENT AND BY THE

02:20:19.411 --> 02:20:21.312
ADMINISTRATION AND I THINK WE

02:20:21.379 --> 02:20:22.313
NEED TO BE ABLE TO GO FURTHER

02:20:22.380 --> 02:20:24.182

02:23:58.596 --> 02:24:00.264
BUT THAT THE STATE NEEDS TO GIVE

02:24:00.331 --> 02:24:02.066
MORE GUIDANCE AND MORE FUNDS TO

02:24:02.133 --> 02:24:04.235
ENABLE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO

02:24:04.302 --> 02:24:05.670
JUST BASICALLY.

02:24:05.737 --> 02:24:07.939
NOT CLOSE THE DOOR ON THESE KIDS

02:24:08.006 --> 02:24:10.575
BECAUSE INVESTING IN THESE KIDS

02:24:10.641 --> 02:24:12.343
CAN REALLY MAN A LOT --

02:24:12.410 --> 02:24:13.745
TO THEIR ABILITY TO THRIVE ON

02:24:13.811 --> 02:24:14.946
THEIR OWN --

02:24:15.013 --> 02:24:16.014
IN THE FUTURE THAT'S WHAT THE

02:24:16.080 --> 02:24:16.881
RESEARCH --

02:24:16.948 --> 02:24:18.116
CERTAINLY SHOWS.

02:24:18.182 --> 02:24:22.286

PENDING THE BAR CHAU STUDIES AS

02:24:28.326 --> 02:24:30.261
MY FIRST QUESTION YES --

DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES --

02:24:35.833 --> 02:24:37.101

CALIFORNIA HAS DONE TO BE A

02:24:52.316 --> 02:24:53.718
PIONEER IN THE SPACE AND THAT'S

02:24:53.785 --> 02:24:54.819
CERTAINLY SOMETHING.

02:24:54.886 --> 02:24:56.621
THAT WE WANT TO REMAIN --

02:24:56.687 --> 02:24:58.056

IT'S ON THE RESEARCH SIDE

02:25:18.743 --> 02:25:20.178
BECAUSE THERE'S STILL SO MUCH

02:25:20.244 --> 02:25:20.778
THAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THE

02:25:20.845 --> 02:25:22.413

02:26:53.371 --> 02:26:54.438
LOOKING TO EXPAND THAT TO

02:26:54.505 --> 02:26:57.375

02:27:26.637 --> 02:27:29.807
TO UTILIZE THAT PROPERTY IN THE

02:27:29.874 --> 02:27:31.475
FUTURE.

02:27:31.542 --> 02:27:32.543
RIGHT TO THE LAST --

IS OF PHARMACEUTICALS AND I I

02:27:55.733 --> 02:27:58.836
THINK IT'S A VERY BOLD --

02:27:58.903 --> 02:28:01.339
IDEA FOR THE GOVERNOR --

02:28:01.405 --> 02:28:04.141
TO AMASS OUR PURCHASES AND TO

02:28:04.208 --> 02:28:06.377
DISCOUNTS ON BEHALF OF THE THE

02:28:06.444 --> 02:28:07.845
STATE I WANTED TO SAY THAT I

02:28:07.912 --> 02:28:09.780
SHARE WITH MY COLLEAGUE --

02:28:09.847 --> 02:28:11.182
SENATOR ROTH THAT --

02:28:11.249 --> 02:28:13.184
THE THREE FORTY THE PROGRAM IS A

02:28:13.251 --> 02:28:16.721
VERY IMPORTANT PROGRAM THAT --

02:28:16.787 --> 02:28:19.824
IT'S DECIMATION CAN CAN CAUSE

02:28:19.890 --> 02:28:21.692
ACTUALLY HOSPITALS TO TO CLOSE

02:28:21.759 --> 02:28:23.561
ESPECIALLY SMALLER HOSPITALS

02:28:23.628 --> 02:28:24.095
THAT.

02:28:24.161 --> 02:28:24.996
ARE BOTH IN --

02:28:25.062 --> 02:28:26.063
CENTER RAS DISTRICT IN MY

02:28:26.130 --> 02:28:27.865
DISTRICT AND IN RIVERSIDE COUNTY

02:28:27.932 --> 02:28:30.101
SO WE WE STAND UNITED AND HOPING

02:28:30.167 --> 02:28:33.204
TO PRESERVE THAT THAT PROGRAM --

02:28:33.271 --> 02:28:34.372
BUT YOU'RE SAYING I ALSO DON'T

02:28:34.438 --> 02:28:35.740
WANT YOU TO RECREATE THE WHEEL

02:28:35.806 --> 02:28:38.009
BECAUSE THERE IS A MECHANISM OUT

02:28:38.075 --> 02:28:39.277
THERE ALREADY.

02:28:39.343 --> 02:28:41.479
BAD CAN --

02:28:41.545 --> 02:28:42.847
GET THE ATTENTION --

02:28:42.913 --> 02:28:44.882
CERTAINLY OF THE DRUG COMPANIES

02:28:44.949 --> 02:28:47.685
AND MAYBE THE STATE OF

02:28:47.752 --> 02:28:48.319
CALIFORNIA JUST FORM ITS OWN P.

02:28:48.386 --> 02:28:51.255
B. THIS THAT OUR NEXT THE

02:28:51.322 --> 02:28:55.026
DISCOUNTS THE DRUG COME.

02:28:55.092 --> 02:28:57.361
UNFORTUNATELY THEY DON'T ALWAYS

02:28:57.428 --> 02:28:58.796
THIS IS.

02:28:58.863 --> 02:28:59.730
FOR THESE --

02:28:59.797 --> 02:29:01.332
MULTI BILLION DOLLAR COMPANY IS

02:29:01.399 --> 02:29:03.000
SET TO TAKE TAKE THE MONEY AND

02:29:03.067 --> 02:29:03.934
YOU KNOW --

02:29:04.001 --> 02:29:06.737
PROVIDE GOOD RETURNS FOR THEIR

02:29:06.804 --> 02:29:08.306
FOR THEIR SHAREHOLDERS HIM WANT

02:29:08.372 --> 02:29:08.906
ONE COMPANY ALONE HAS OF THE

02:29:08.973 --> 02:29:10.207
MARKET VALUE OF FORTY SEVEN

02:29:10.274 --> 02:29:11.375
BILLION DOLLARS.

02:29:11.442 --> 02:29:12.910
I'LL GUARANTEE THE NOT GETTING

02:29:12.977 --> 02:29:13.477
FIFTEEN CENTS A CLAIM FOR A

02:29:13.544 --> 02:29:15.212
PRESCRIPTION IT IS TRANSMITTED

02:29:15.279 --> 02:29:16.614
THROUGH THAT.

02:29:16.681 --> 02:29:18.749
THAT HUB IF YOU WILL TO THE PBM

02:29:18.816 --> 02:29:20.217
ACTS AS A HUB EVERY PRESCRIPTION

02:29:20.284 --> 02:29:21.686
GOES THROUGH THAT HUB. TO ALL

02:29:21.752 --> 02:29:22.186
THE DIFFERENT --

02:29:22.253 --> 02:29:23.554
INSURANCE COMPANIES AND HAVE TO

02:29:23.621 --> 02:29:25.389
PAY THE PRICE SO YOU MAY LOOK AT

02:29:25.456 --> 02:29:26.791
THE MODEL OF THE PBM FOR THE

02:29:26.857 --> 02:29:28.159
STATE OF CALIFORNIA AS A WAY TO

02:29:28.225 --> 02:29:30.227
EXPEDITE THE POSITIONING OF THE

02:29:30.294 --> 02:29:32.096
STATE OF CALIFORNIA --

02:29:32.163 --> 02:29:33.864
TO GET INTO --

02:29:33.931 --> 02:29:36.267
THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING --

02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:37.368
THE COST OF MEDICATIONS IT'LL

02:29:37.435 --> 02:29:43.140
LOWER PRICE FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS --

02:29:43.207 --> 02:29:44.542
I'M A VERY STRONG SUPPORTER OF

02:29:44.608 --> 02:29:45.910
OF CLEAN WATER FOR EVERYONE IN

02:29:45.976 --> 02:29:47.378
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:29:47.445 --> 02:29:48.045
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS

02:29:48.112 --> 02:29:48.713
AN ONGOING COST OF THAT BUT WHEN

02:29:48.779 --> 02:29:49.680
YOU LOOK AT THE BUDGET SURPLUS

02:29:49.747 --> 02:29:52.883
THAT WE HAVE THE CASA PROVIDING --

02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:54.251
THE BOTTLE WATER WHICH I THINK

02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:56.020
IS VERY IMPORTANT AND ULTIMATELY

02:29:56.087 --> 02:29:58.055
FINDING THE ETIOLOGY OF WHAT'S

02:29:58.122 --> 02:29:59.323
CAUSING THE PROBLEMS IN THE

02:29:59.390 --> 02:30:01.759
SPECIFIED AREAS OF THE STATE AND

02:30:01.826 --> 02:30:02.893
THEN COMING UP OF TH CAPITAL

02:30:02.960 --> 02:30:04.228
BROUGH PLAN. TO FIX THEM WHETHER

02:30:04.295 --> 02:30:05.863
IT'S A JOINING THEM TO DIFFERENT

02:30:05.930 --> 02:30:07.732
WATER DISTRICTS AND INCENTIVIZE

02:30:07.798 --> 02:30:09.433
IN THE WATER DISTRICTS PROVIDE

02:30:09.500 --> 02:30:10.568
THAT CLEAN WATER.

02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:12.002
MY POINT HERE IS THAT IT IS

02:30:12.069 --> 02:30:13.804
IMPORTANT BUT I THINK THAT.

02:30:13.871 --> 02:30:15.439
YOU KNOW IN A STATE WHERE WE

02:30:15.506 --> 02:30:19.009
HAVE THIS MINIMAL COST IN

02:30:19.076 --> 02:30:20.411
COMPARISON TO OUR STATE BUDGET

02:30:20.478 --> 02:30:22.046
TO FIX THIS PROBLEM IS THE

02:30:22.113 --> 02:30:22.747
MINIMUS.

02:30:22.813 --> 02:30:24.682
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT MANY OF

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:26.250
OUR CITIZENS ESPECIALLY IN MY

02:30:26.317 --> 02:30:27.818
DISTRICT THEY'RE JUST TAX

02:30:27.885 --> 02:30:28.552
FATIGUE.

02:30:28.619 --> 02:30:30.521
AND WHEN HE HEARD ABOUT IT WATER

02:30:30.588 --> 02:30:31.989
TAX -- THE

02:30:32.056 --> 02:30:33.090
IF THEY FLIP OUT IS A REALLY

02:30:33.157 --> 02:30:35.626
ANOTHER TAX THAT WE HAVE TO

02:30:35.693 --> 02:30:36.293
CONTEND WITH --

02:30:36.360 --> 02:30:39.196
WE HAVE BEEN --

02:30:39.263 --> 02:30:40.331
CHARGING TAXES IN THE STATE OF

02:30:40.398 --> 02:30:42.166
CALIFORNIA THAT WERE --

02:30:42.233 --> 02:30:43.334
IT IN RECENT YEARS THAT WERE

02:30:43.401 --> 02:30:44.502
PROMISED TO BE TEMPORARY THAT

02:30:44.568 --> 02:30:45.936
BECAME PERMANENT SO WE HAVE A

02:30:46.003 --> 02:30:48.472
GOOD STRONG TAX REVENUE IT WOULD

02:30:48.539 --> 02:30:49.340
BE GREAT FOR THIS GOVERNOR

02:30:49.407 --> 02:30:51.108
DIMMED. TO SOMEHOW TAKE A

02:30:51.175 --> 02:30:52.109
LEADERSHIP ROLE SO YOU KNOW OUR

02:30:52.176 --> 02:30:53.677
CITIZENS ARE TAX ENOUGH WE ARE

02:30:53.744 --> 02:30:54.712
GOING TO PROVIDE THIS THE WATER

02:30:54.779 --> 02:30:56.380
AND GUARANTEE THAT EVERYONE IN

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:57.948
CALIFORNIA GETS CLEAN WATER.

02:30:58.015 --> 02:30:59.517
AND WE'RE GONNA INSURED THROUGH

02:30:59.583 --> 02:31:00.885
MONEY THAT IS DEDICATED --

02:31:00.951 --> 02:31:02.286
THROUGH THE GENERAL FUND I HOPE

02:31:02.353 --> 02:31:04.622
THAT THE GOVERNOR WILL DO THAT

02:31:04.688 --> 02:31:06.690
AND THEN LASTLY.

02:31:06.757 --> 02:31:07.291
I WANT TO APPLY THE GOVERNOR

02:31:07.358 --> 02:31:08.592
ONCE AGAIN --

02:31:08.659 --> 02:31:12.530
BECAUSE MANY OF US OR MAYBE USE

02:31:12.596 --> 02:31:14.365
A QUESTION MARK FOR MANY OF US

02:31:14.432 --> 02:31:14.965
WE DIDN'T KNOW IF HE WAS GOING

02:31:15.032 --> 02:31:17.368
TO BE THE THE FISCAL HAWK YOU

02:31:17.435 --> 02:31:18.636
WILL THAT THE GOVERNOR BROWN

02:31:18.702 --> 02:31:20.671
SHOWED HIMSELF TO BE AND AND I

02:31:20.738 --> 02:31:22.406
HAVE TO APPLAUD HIM AS HE IS NOW

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:24.475
DEPARTED. FOR THE ROOT ROBUST --

02:31:24.542 --> 02:31:26.243
FUNDS THAT WE HAVE IN OUR IN OUR

02:31:26.310 --> 02:31:27.711
RESERVES IN THE EVENT A OF AN

02:31:27.778 --> 02:31:29.747
EMERGENCY --

02:31:29.814 --> 02:31:31.682
SO I I WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I

02:31:31.749 --> 02:31:34.051
SUPPORT THE THAT THE THE MONEY

02:31:34.118 --> 02:31:36.387
THAT IS GIVEN TO STIRS UP AND

02:31:36.454 --> 02:31:38.556
23% OF POTENTIALLY THERE.

02:31:38.622 --> 02:31:39.924
A REVENUE IS GONNA BE THE

02:31:39.990 --> 02:31:40.724
PENSIONS AND OVER WHAT THAT

02:31:40.791 --> 02:31:41.559
MONEY GOING TO THE CLASSROOM AND

02:31:41.625 --> 02:31:43.093
CERTAINLY GOING --

02:31:43.160 --> 02:31:45.296
TO KERR'S --

02:31:45.362 --> 02:31:47.698
THREE BILLION DOLLARS THIS

02:31:47.765 --> 02:31:48.966
ADDRESSES THE SYMPTOMS IT

02:31:49.033 --> 02:31:50.835
DOESN'T ADDRESS THE PROBLEMS SO

02:31:50.901 --> 02:31:52.069
WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE TAKING

02:31:52.136 --> 02:31:53.037
BECAUSE WE'RE PUTTING IT ON A

02:31:53.103 --> 02:31:55.139
WOUND FOR PATIENTS GOT ANTI

02:31:55.206 --> 02:31:57.041
COAGULANT THERAPY.

02:31:57.107 --> 02:31:58.943
AND HAS NO WAY TO CLOT RIGHT

02:31:59.009 --> 02:31:59.743
CERTAINLY --

02:31:59.810 --> 02:32:00.377
CENTER PAN UNDERSTANDS WHAT I'M

02:32:00.444 --> 02:32:03.113
SAYING WE NEED TO PROVIDE A BILL

02:32:03.180 --> 02:32:04.448
THAT'S GOING TO COST AND CLOUDY.

02:32:04.515 --> 02:32:06.350
AND THE WAY THAT WE WE WE MAKE

02:32:06.417 --> 02:32:07.318
THAT KILLED ACOSTA CLOTTING AS

02:32:07.384 --> 02:32:09.720
WE HAVE TO FIGURE OUT A PENSION

02:32:09.787 --> 02:32:10.654
SYSTEM IN THE STATE OF

02:32:10.721 --> 02:32:12.022
CALIFORNIA THAT WORKS FOR THE

02:32:12.089 --> 02:32:13.457
WORKERS.

02:32:13.524 --> 02:32:14.825
BUT DOESN'T BECOME AN ONGOING

02:32:14.892 --> 02:32:16.393
LIABILITY FOR THE CITIZENS OF

02:32:16.460 --> 02:32:18.128
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THE

02:32:18.195 --> 02:32:19.230
STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

02:32:19.296 --> 02:32:20.731
AND IT NEEDS TO BE A BIPARTISAN

02:32:20.798 --> 02:32:22.900
SOLUTION SO I HOPE THAT THE

02:32:22.967 --> 02:32:28.072
GOVERNOR SEES THIS IS --

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:29.773
STOPPING UP UP UP AN ACUTE

02:32:29.840 --> 02:32:30.341
PROBLEM BUT THERE ARE SOME

02:32:30.407 --> 02:32:31.041
CHRONIC ISSUES THAT ARE GOING TO

02:32:31.108 --> 02:32:31.809
CONTINUE TO TO LINGER ON IF WE

02:32:31.876 --> 02:32:33.110
DON'T ADDRESS.

02:32:33.177 --> 02:32:35.479
SOME TYPE OF PENSION REFORMS

02:32:35.546 --> 02:32:37.081
THAT ARE TRUE IN THE STATE OF

02:32:37.147 --> 02:32:38.716
CALIFORNIA SO THAT EVERY YEAR --

02:32:38.782 --> 02:32:40.117
WE DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE

02:32:40.184 --> 02:32:41.719
STOCK MARKET HAVING LIKE A

02:32:41.785 --> 02:32:43.487
DECEMBER THAT IT HAD AND

02:32:43.554 --> 02:32:45.022
WONDERING LIKE I HEARD SOMEBODY

02:32:45.089 --> 02:32:45.756
SAY THAT.

02:32:45.823 --> 02:32:47.658
PURSE LOST TEN BILLION ONE DAY

02:32:47.725 --> 02:32:48.592
IN DECEMBER AND IT'S A LOT OF

02:32:48.659 --> 02:32:50.094
MONEY -- WE

02:32:50.160 --> 02:32:52.663
NEED TO HAVE A MORE STABLE --

02:32:52.730 --> 02:32:54.198
MECHANISM OF ENSURING THAT OUR

02:32:54.265 --> 02:32:55.666
RETIREES GET WHICH PROMISE OF

02:32:55.733 --> 02:32:58.469
THEM BUT IN A WAY IN WHICH WE

02:32:58.536 --> 02:32:59.036
CAN AFFORD AT THE STATE OF

02:32:59.103 --> 02:33:01.539
CALIFORNIA I HOPE THE GOVERNOR

02:33:01.605 --> 02:33:02.806
WILL BE OPEN TO THAT

02:33:02.873 --> 02:33:03.107
[inaudible]

02:33:03.173 --> 02:33:10.548
THANK YOU.

02:33:10.614 --> 02:33:11.649

02:33:22.626 --> 02:33:24.028
PRESENTATION --

02:33:24.094 --> 02:33:24.628
PRETTY GOOD FOR YOUR FIRST AT

02:33:24.695 --> 02:33:28.866
BAT -- I I

02:33:28.933 --> 02:33:30.901
WANT TO DO RES.

02:33:30.968 --> 02:33:33.103
A STRUCTURAL ISSUE THAT THAT A

02:33:33.170 --> 02:33:34.538
LINE WAS SOMEWHAT MY COLLEAGUES

02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:36.273
ALREADY BEEN TALKING ABOUT --

02:33:36.340 --> 02:33:38.375
TERMS OF RISK AND LONG TERM

02:33:38.442 --> 02:33:39.276
LIABILITIES IN THIS BUDGET.

02:33:39.343 --> 02:33:42.546
I REALLY PPRECIATE THE EMPHASIS --

02:33:42.613 --> 02:33:44.315
ON TRYING TO BUY DOWN SOME THOSE

02:33:44.381 --> 02:33:46.584
DEBTS AND LIABILITIES I THINK WE

02:33:46.650 --> 02:33:48.719
YOU KNOW ROUGH NUMBERS WERE

02:33:48.786 --> 02:33:50.354
PUTTING --

02:33:50.421 --> 02:33:52.690
YOU KNOW TWENTY BILLION ALMOST

02:33:52.756 --> 02:33:55.225
IN THERE'S ABOUT TWENTY SEVENTY

02:33:55.292 --> 02:33:56.527
FIVE BILLION LEFT IF YOU IF YOU

02:33:56.594 --> 02:33:58.028
ADD IT ALL UP FOR TWITTER

02:33:58.095 --> 02:33:58.862
SEVENTY TWO DEPENDING ON HOW YOU

02:33:58.929 --> 02:34:00.130
DO THE MATH --

02:34:00.197 --> 02:34:03.033
IN OUR DEBT RATIO IS STILL --

02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:05.102
RATHER HIGH COMPARED TO OTHER

02:34:05.169 --> 02:34:06.604
LARGE POPULOUS STATES MAY THINK

02:34:06.670 --> 02:34:08.539
ONLY NEW YORK AND ILLINOIS ARE

02:34:08.606 --> 02:34:09.907
HIGHER BUT BUT WE'RE MAKING

02:34:09.974 --> 02:34:13.410
WE'RE CHIPPING AWAY AT IT --

02:34:13.477 --> 02:34:14.979
BUT THE WAY THE WAY THIS BUDGET

02:34:15.045 --> 02:34:16.246
CATEGORIZES.

02:34:16.313 --> 02:34:19.216
THE CLIMATE CHANGE LIABILITY --

02:34:19.283 --> 02:34:22.019
I I WOULD I WOULD COMMEND YOU.

02:34:22.086 --> 02:34:23.988
TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO REORGANIZE

02:34:24.054 --> 02:34:27.391
THAT THINKING BECAUSE YOU KNOW

02:34:27.458 --> 02:34:29.126
WE WE SORT OF LIST DISASTER

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:30.694
RELATED EXPENSES AS AS A

02:34:30.761 --> 02:34:33.931
DIFFERENT KIND OF LIGHT ITEM.

02:34:33.998 --> 02:34:35.466
BUT AS YOU YOURSELF SAID.

02:34:35.532 --> 02:34:38.502
THE DYNAMIC GENERAL FUND IMPACT --

02:34:38.569 --> 02:34:40.537
WE WE KEEP INCURRING THESE MULTI

02:34:40.604 --> 02:34:42.373
BILLION DOLLAR --

02:34:42.439 --> 02:34:45.275
COSTS YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH THE

02:34:45.342 --> 02:34:47.444
SFE YOU AS TO SORT OF RESPOND WE

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:49.113
DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT'S COMING

02:34:49.179 --> 02:34:50.280
WHEN IT'S COMING.

02:34:50.347 --> 02:34:51.382
AND IT EATS INTO OUR BIGGER

02:34:51.448 --> 02:34:52.650
PRIORITIES WHICH I THINK ARE

02:34:52.716 --> 02:34:53.917
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

02:34:53.984 --> 02:34:56.553
HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES.

02:34:56.620 --> 02:34:57.187
ALL THE INVESTMENT HIGHER

02:34:57.254 --> 02:34:58.822
EDUCATION --

02:34:58.889 --> 02:35:00.190
HEALTH CARE.

02:35:00.257 --> 02:35:01.925
THESE ARE THESE YOUR EXPENSES

02:35:01.992 --> 02:35:04.094
THAT ACTUALLY PAID DIVIDENDS IN

02:35:04.161 --> 02:35:06.830
THE END A YIELD SAVINGS I I IG I

02:35:06.897 --> 02:35:07.831
WOULD ALSO SAY THOUGH THAT.

02:35:07.898 --> 02:35:09.533
THESE INVESTMENTS IN BOTH

02:35:09.600 --> 02:35:12.169
CLIMATE CHANGE MEDICAID STIR

02:35:12.236 --> 02:35:14.672
SUPPRESSION ALSO HAVE SOME OF

02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:16.473
THOSE SAME ELEMENTS RIGHT SO.

02:35:16.540 --> 02:35:18.809
I'M WONDERING AS WE LEAD UP TO

02:35:18.876 --> 02:35:19.877
SAY THE NEXT FULL BUDGET HEARING

02:35:19.943 --> 02:35:20.911
MORE WE DIVE DEEPER INTO THE

02:35:20.978 --> 02:35:22.146
WILD FIRE ISSUE.

02:35:22.212 --> 02:35:24.848
IF WE CAN KIND OF SCOPE JUST

02:35:24.915 --> 02:35:25.516
PULL BACK THE SCOPE A LITTLE BIT.

02:35:25.582 --> 02:35:29.253
AT KIND OF CHANGES EMERGENCY IN

02:35:29.319 --> 02:35:30.354
THE STATE.

02:35:30.421 --> 02:35:31.789
AND IT'S BOTH THE HUMAN

02:35:31.855 --> 02:35:32.756
EMERGENCY IN A AND A FISCAL

02:35:32.823 --> 02:35:34.625
EMERGENCY --

02:35:34.692 --> 02:35:35.926
AND YOU KNOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

02:35:35.993 --> 02:35:37.461
MAYBE A TWO BILLION DOLLAR

02:35:37.528 --> 02:35:39.163
PROJECTION FOR THIS YEAR LAST

02:35:39.229 --> 02:35:41.298
YEAR PROPERTY LOSS ALONE ON

02:35:41.365 --> 02:35:42.733
WE'LL SEE I MEAN ON ON ON THOMAS

02:35:42.800 --> 02:35:44.668
AND AND AND SOME OF THE OTHER

02:35:44.735 --> 02:35:45.369
FIRES WE WERE.

02:35:45.436 --> 02:35:46.704
ABOUT --

02:35:46.770 --> 02:35:47.805
TWENTY WE DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S

02:35:47.871 --> 02:35:49.573
GOING TO STACK UP TO THIS YEAR I

02:35:49.640 --> 02:35:51.275
WAS INSURANCE WILL COVER SAMAN

02:35:51.341 --> 02:35:52.409
FEMA HAS A ROLE.

02:35:52.476 --> 02:35:55.746
BUT HAS THERE BEEN SORT OF ANY

02:35:55.813 --> 02:35:58.849
EFFORT. TO QUANTIFY THE TOTAL

02:35:58.916 --> 02:36:00.651
LIABILITY --

02:36:00.718 --> 02:36:01.952
TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

02:36:02.019 --> 02:36:03.654
THE SAME WAY WE SURE TO DO THAT

02:36:03.721 --> 02:36:05.222
FOR OTHER DEBTS AND LIABILITIES

02:36:05.289 --> 02:36:08.092
AROUND CLIMATE CHANGE RISK WRIT

02:36:08.158 --> 02:36:09.460
LARGE AND I WOULD JUST.

02:36:09.526 --> 02:36:12.162
I WOULD ASK IF IF NOT I KNOW

02:36:12.229 --> 02:36:13.297
WE'VE DONE IT SOME CLIMATE

02:36:13.363 --> 02:36:14.431
ASSESSMENTS OVER THE YEARS I

02:36:14.498 --> 02:36:16.033
BELIEVE WE FINISHED OUR FOURTH.

02:36:16.100 --> 02:36:18.135
LAST YEAR.

02:36:18.202 --> 02:36:19.369
IT'S THE DOCUMENT A SCIENTIFIC

02:36:19.436 --> 02:36:20.571
IN NATURE.

02:36:20.637 --> 02:36:22.439
BUT NOT FISCAL IN THE SAME WAY

02:36:22.506 --> 02:36:23.941
THAT IT REALLY OPERATES THROUGH

02:36:24.007 --> 02:36:25.042
DO F..

02:36:25.109 --> 02:36:26.210
I'D LIKE TO SEE THOSE

02:36:26.276 --> 02:36:28.078
CONNECTIONS GET MADE MORE

COMPREHENSIVE INTEGRATED

02:41:21.805 --> 02:41:24.574
APPROACH ON THE CAL FIRE SITE IS

02:41:24.641 --> 02:41:27.811
WE TALK ABOUT FIVE PREVENTION IT

02:41:27.878 --> 02:41:29.513
CHECKS A BUNCH OF BOXES. ONE IS

02:41:29.579 --> 02:41:30.013
THE CARBON SEQUESTRATION

02:41:30.080 --> 02:41:32.949
BENEFITS OF HAVING A HEALTHY

02:41:36.720 --> 02:41:39.256
NET CARBON --

02:41:39.322 --> 02:41:42.392
THINK OF IT AS OPPOSED TO A

02:41:42.459 --> 02:41:43.660
CARBON EMITTER AND THAT'S WHY

02:41:43.727 --> 02:41:46.163
INVESTING IN THE FIRE PREVENTION

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:47.230

NOT ONLY MAKE SENSE FROM A

02:41:47.898 --> 02:41:49.933
PUBLIC SAFETY PERSPECTIVE BUT

02:41:50.000 --> 02:41:51.168
ALSO FROM A BROADER CLIMATE

02:41:51.234 --> 02:41:52.569
PERSPECTIVE --

02:41:52.636 --> 02:41:53.470
AND THEN OF COURSE THE

02:41:53.537 --> 02:41:55.138
INVESTMENTS --

02:41:55.205 --> 02:41:57.808

02:42:05.148 --> 02:42:07.517
ATTACK THAT PREVENTS THE FIRES

02:42:07.584 --> 02:42:09.386
FROM BECOMING CATASTROPHIC AS

02:42:09.453 --> 02:42:11.254
WELL WHICH ALSO HAS CLIMATE

02:42:11.321 --> 02:42:12.489
BENEFITS AS WELL AS THE PUBLIC

02:42:12.556 --> 02:42:14.157

DOLLAR --

02:46:03.453 --> 02:46:04.954
FROM --

02:46:05.021 --> 02:46:05.522

02:48:45.748 --> 02:48:47.717
FIRST IN PUPIL A PER PUPIL

02:48:47.784 --> 02:48:49.352
SPENDING FOR SCHOOL HEALTH AND

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:50.720
SCHOOL MENTAL HEALTH.

02:48:50.787 --> 02:48:52.889
WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT RIGHT --

02:48:52.956 --> 02:48:56.860
WE ARE WHAT THE LOWEST IF NOT

02:48:56.926 --> 02:48:57.460
THE LOWEST STATES IN TERMS THE

02:48:57.527 --> 02:48:58.294
AMOUNT OF MAY.

02:48:58.361 --> 02:49:00.196
BE MEDI CAL ELLIE A MONEY THAT

02:49:00.263 --> 02:49:01.331
WE DRAW DOWN --

02:49:01.397 --> 02:49:04.200
SO WHY IS IT WHY CAN'T WILL HE

02:49:04.267 --> 02:49:04.834
STILL --

02:49:04.901 --> 02:49:08.805
THAT DO BETTER AT COMPARED.

02:49:08.872 --> 02:49:10.540
TO THE OTHER STATES THAT THAT IS

02:49:10.607 --> 02:49:12.408
FEDERAL MONEY LEóN TABLES AND

02:49:12.475 --> 02:49:13.510
ALL THOSE WE HAVE STATE MONEY

02:49:13.576 --> 02:49:14.110
WE'RE PUTTING IN WILL COUNTY

02:49:14.177 --> 02:49:15.612
LOCAL MONEY WE SHOULD BE TRYING

02:49:15.678 --> 02:49:17.046
THOSE MATCHES DOWN WHY.

02:49:17.113 --> 02:49:17.814
ARE OUR DEPART HEALTHCARE

02:49:17.881 --> 02:49:18.381
SERVICE SHOULD BE ACTIVELY

02:49:18.448 --> 02:49:20.083
WORKING WITH SCHOOL DISTRICTS

02:49:20.149 --> 02:49:21.684
AND OUR COUNTY OFFICE OF

02:49:21.751 --> 02:49:23.419
EDUCATION AND THAT THE PART TO

02:49:23.486 --> 02:49:24.287
SAY YOU KNOW WE WHY ARE WE

02:49:24.354 --> 02:49:25.655
LEAVING THIS MONEY ON THE TABLE

02:49:25.722 --> 02:49:27.223
WE SHOULD BE PULLING THAT MONEY

02:49:27.290 --> 02:49:27.724
IN.

02:49:27.790 --> 02:49:28.525
SO --

02:49:28.591 --> 02:49:29.626
PERHAPS I'M GONNA ASK EACH OF

02:49:29.692 --> 02:49:31.027
YOU TO PASS SPEAK TO WHAT ARE

02:49:31.094 --> 02:49:32.161
SOME OF THE THINGS THAT AND

02:49:32.228 --> 02:49:33.596
AGAIN I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE ALL

02:49:33.663 --> 02:49:38.067
THE WONDERFUL THINGS AND

02:49:38.134 --> 02:49:40.336
ACTUALLY LOOKING AT HOW CAN WE

02:49:40.403 --> 02:49:41.037
TO EVEN MORE.

02:49:41.104 --> 02:49:42.906
WITHOUT EVEN SPENDING MORE FROM --

02:49:42.972 --> 02:49:44.440
THE STATE BUT DRYING DOWN THOSE

02:49:44.507 --> 02:49:45.074
FED OF THOSE OPTIONS ARE FEDERAL

02:49:45.141 --> 02:49:48.044
MATCHES BUILD ON FOOT THE

02:49:48.111 --> 02:49:49.679
GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING A WITH MORE

02:49:49.746 --> 02:49:52.382
RESOURCES SO PERHAPS THAT MAYBE

02:49:52.448 --> 02:49:54.817
THE DRAGONFLY FINANCES BE FIRST

02:49:54.884 --> 02:49:55.552
IN A LA --

02:49:55.618 --> 02:49:57.353
CAN AT TO SEE WHETHER THEY HAD A

02:49:57.420 --> 02:49:58.321
PERSPECTIVE ON THAT.

02:49:58.388 --> 02:49:59.489
ALL MAKE TWO QUICK POINTS BEFORE

02:49:59.556 --> 02:50:00.623
TURNING OVER TO THIS YEAR --

02:50:00.690 --> 02:50:03.459
THE FIRST IS ON A MENTAL HEALTH.

02:50:03.526 --> 02:50:04.861
IS A PRIORITY BUT AS YOU KNOW

02:50:04.928 --> 02:50:05.728
MUCH MORE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS

02:50:05.795 --> 02:50:06.729
MORE THAT WE CAN DO AND ONE

02:50:06.796 --> 02:50:07.397
THING IN THIS ISN'T SPECIFICALLY

02:50:07.463 --> 02:50:08.765
ON PROGRAM FUNDING --

02:50:08.831 --> 02:50:10.600
BUT THE GOVERNOR IS COMMITTED --

02:50:10.667 --> 02:50:12.201
TO APPOINTING A VERY HIGH LEVEL

02:50:12.268 --> 02:50:13.703
ADVISER IN MENTAL HEALTH SOMEONE

02:50:13.770 --> 02:50:15.004
WHO IS A TRUE LEADER IN THE

02:50:15.071 --> 02:50:17.273
FIELD NATIONALLY SO --

02:50:17.340 --> 02:50:18.241
YOU SHOULD BE HEARING ARE WE

02:50:18.308 --> 02:50:19.475
ALSO BE HEARING WHO THAT PERSON

02:50:19.542 --> 02:50:21.444
IS AND WHAT THAT PERSON CAN DO A

02:50:21.511 --> 02:50:22.145
VERY EXCITED ABOUT THAT.

02:50:22.211 --> 02:50:23.346
COUPLE WEEKS --

02:50:23.413 --> 02:50:24.547
SO THAT'S ONE POINT AND THEN I

02:50:24.614 --> 02:50:25.949
THINK ON SECOND POINT MORE

02:50:26.015 --> 02:50:26.549
BROADLY ON MEDI CAL I THINK

02:50:26.616 --> 02:50:28.618
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT ANYTHING

02:50:28.685 --> 02:50:29.953
THAT WE CAN DO TO DRAW DOWN

02:50:30.019 --> 02:50:31.354
FEDERAL DOLLARS AND I THINK FOR

02:50:31.421 --> 02:50:32.422
MANY OF US.

02:50:32.488 --> 02:50:33.656
IT WAS REALLY WHEN THE

02:50:33.723 --> 02:50:34.624
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT WAS IN

02:50:34.691 --> 02:50:37.527
JEOPARDY DURING THE SUMMER OF

02:50:37.594 --> 02:50:38.161
TWENTY SEVENTEEN MARKET SOMEONE

02:50:38.227 --> 02:50:39.095
MULTIPLE POINTS THROUGHOUT THAT

02:50:39.162 --> 02:50:39.562
YEAR.

02:50:39.629 --> 02:50:41.230
THAT WE REALLY SAW HOW DEPENDENT

02:50:41.297 --> 02:50:42.332
THE STATE BUDGET IS.

02:50:42.398 --> 02:50:43.700
ON FEDERAL HOW YOU PLAY IT IT'S

02:50:43.766 --> 02:50:45.735
ALMOST 80% OF OUR OVERALL MEDI

02:50:45.802 --> 02:50:47.303
CAL BUDGET AND HOW WE CAN DO

02:50:47.370 --> 02:50:49.472
EVEN MORE AND SO ONE PRIORITY IN

02:50:49.539 --> 02:50:50.974
THIS BUDGET IS.

02:50:51.040 --> 02:50:56.512
SEEING OTHER WAYS AND WE WE CAN

02:50:56.579 --> 02:50:57.080
DRAW DOWN MEDI CAL AND OTHER

02:50:57.146 --> 02:50:59.983
SOCIAL SIR THE PRODUCTIVE HEALTH

02:51:00.049 --> 02:51:01.818
SERVICES THROUGHOUT FAMILY

02:51:01.884 --> 02:51:03.252
PLANNING THE FACT PROGRAMS AND

02:51:03.319 --> 02:51:04.654
THAT'S THE WAY I BELIEVE I NEED

02:51:04.721 --> 02:51:07.190
TO DOUBLE CHECK THE STRUCTURE-BUT I BELIEVE IT'S ALMOST NINE

02:51:07.256 --> 02:51:09.125
OR TEN TO ONE MATCH.

02:51:09.192 --> 02:51:10.460
YES CORRECT SO I THINK YOU'LL BE

02:51:10.526 --> 02:51:11.361
PUTTING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS

02:51:11.427 --> 02:51:13.329
AND THAT WOULD DRAW DOWN ANOTHER

02:51:13.396 --> 02:51:13.863
FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION

02:51:13.930 --> 02:51:14.163
DOLLARS --

02:51:14.230 --> 02:51:15.298
AND AND THIS IS MORE IN THE

02:51:15.365 --> 02:51:17.333
SOCIAL SERVICES SIDE BUT FOR SSI

02:51:17.400 --> 02:51:19.002
THE TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS

02:51:19.068 --> 02:51:20.169
AS A WAY TO GET MUCH MORE SO

02:51:20.236 --> 02:51:21.337
DEFINITELY WE LOOK FORWARD TO

02:51:21.404 --> 02:51:22.939
WORKING WITH YOU ON THE MENTAL

02:51:23.006 --> 02:51:23.973
HEALTH SIDE IN OTHER.

02:51:24.040 --> 02:51:26.676
PROGRAMS WITHIN MEDI CAL HOW WE

02:51:26.743 --> 02:51:29.479
CAN GET ADDITIONAL DOLLARS.

02:51:29.545 --> 02:51:30.880
I THINK FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AS

02:51:30.947 --> 02:51:32.448
WE KNOW IN OUR OVERVIEW.

02:51:32.515 --> 02:51:33.116
BY NOT --

02:51:33.182 --> 02:51:34.784
EXTENDING THE MCO TAX WE WE

02:51:34.851 --> 02:51:35.952
ESTIMATE THAT THE STATE IS FOR

02:51:36.019 --> 02:51:37.487
GOING ABOUT UP ONE POINT FIVE

02:51:37.553 --> 02:51:38.921
BILLION DOLLARS IN AN ADDITIONAL

02:51:38.988 --> 02:51:40.256
FEDERAL FUNDS WOULD BE A DIRECT

02:51:40.323 --> 02:51:41.691
GENERAL FUND BENEFIT.

02:51:41.758 --> 02:51:43.960
ON WHEN YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTIONS --

02:51:44.027 --> 02:51:46.496
REGARDING AND MEDI CAL DRAWDOWN

02:51:47.163 --> 02:51:47.997
WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO TRY TO

02:51:48.064 --> 02:51:49.365
UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE MORE FULLY

02:51:49.432 --> 02:51:51.167
IT'S NOT ONE WERE PREPARED TO

02:51:51.234 --> 02:51:54.270
COMMENT ON RIGHT NOW.

02:51:54.337 --> 02:51:56.172
AND AND SO I JUST AGAIN I

02:51:56.239 --> 02:51:57.206
APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL THAT'S

02:51:57.273 --> 02:51:58.041

APPRECIATE THAT STEP BY --

02:52:12.989 --> 02:52:14.123

02:52:14.791 --> 02:52:16.325
CAMPAIGN SO FROM THE GET GO THAT

02:52:16.392 --> 02:52:17.894

02:52:17.960 --> 02:52:18.961
AND ULTIMATELY DELTA IMPROVE

02:52:19.028 --> 02:52:20.396
ACCESS TO MEDICAL AND I THINK

02:52:20.463 --> 02:52:21.664

02:52:44.654 --> 02:52:45.488
REGARDING --

02:52:45.555 --> 02:52:46.456
WHETHER THE ADMINISTRATION

02:52:46.522 --> 02:52:48.057
ACTUALLY HAS A COST ESTIMATE OF

02:52:48.124 --> 02:52:49.926
COVERING ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE

02:52:49.992 --> 02:52:51.894
ADULTS AND SENIORS --

02:52:51.961 --> 02:52:54.397
REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS --

02:52:54.464 --> 02:52:55.231
IN ADDITION TO THE IN ADULTS

02:52:55.298 --> 02:52:58.701

AND HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS TWENTY

02:52:59.836 --> 02:53:00.737
SIX AN OLDER WOULD BE INCOME

02:53:00.803 --> 02:53:03.072
ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL BUT FOR

02:53:03.139 --> 02:53:04.173
THE IMMIGRATION STATUS ON THAT.

02:53:04.240 --> 02:53:06.275
I DON'T KNOW THAT I SAW IN THE

02:53:06.342 --> 02:53:08.277

02:53:12.415 --> 02:53:14.083
QUESTIONS AND THEN WE'LL OPEN IT

02:53:14.150 --> 02:53:15.918
UP.

02:53:15.985 --> 02:53:19.255
FOR PUBLIC COMMENT --

02:53:19.322 --> 02:53:20.656
I'M NOT GONNA BE REDUNDANT WITH

02:53:20.723 --> 02:53:21.557
WHAT SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES ASKED

02:53:21.624 --> 02:53:22.258
BUT IT WAS ONE ISSUE THAT I

02:53:22.325 --> 02:53:24.026
DIDN'T HEAR ANYONE SPECIFICALLY

02:53:24.093 --> 02:53:25.061
REFERENCED IN THAT HAVE TO DO

02:53:25.128 --> 02:53:26.162

02:53:26.229 --> 02:53:28.831
EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION.

02:53:33.970 --> 02:53:36.672
AREA EXCEPT EASY.

02:53:36.739 --> 02:53:38.274
AND SO WE'RE CLEAR CASE TO

02:53:38.341 --> 02:53:39.108

02:53:39.175 --> 02:53:41.577

02:53:43.012 --> 02:53:44.981
THE INTEREST --

02:53:45.047 --> 02:53:47.483
AND THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT.

02:53:47.550 --> 02:53:49.118
IN PRESCHOOL FOR ALL I'M GLAD TO

02:53:49.185 --> 02:53:53.589

ADDITIONAL SLOTS.

02:54:02.565 --> 02:54:03.366

A REAL ISSUE AROUND

02:54:13.676 --> 02:54:15.645
AFFORDABILITY AND ACCESS FOR

CALIFORNIA'S.

02:54:23.452 --> 02:54:25.822
YOUNGEST RESIDENTS --

SURE THAT WE'RE NOT IGNORING THE

02:54:38.968 --> 02:54:41.003
ZERO TO THREE YEAR OLDS --

02:54:41.070 --> 02:54:43.239

02:54:46.809 --> 02:54:49.011
CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT BUT

02:54:49.078 --> 02:54:50.046
REALLY WANT TO TALK ABOUT THE

02:54:50.112 --> 02:54:51.647
IMPORTANCE OF THE CONTINUUM OF

02:54:51.714 --> 02:54:53.516
CARE ISSUE --

02:54:53.583 --> 02:54:54.650
ONE QUICK QUESTION I HOPE YOU'RE

02:54:54.717 --> 02:54:56.118
GONNA BE ABLE TO ANSWER FOR ME

02:54:56.185 --> 02:54:56.652
UNDER CALIFORNIA'S TO NAY

02:54:56.719 --> 02:54:58.187
COMMISSION.

02:54:58.254 --> 02:55:00.723
WOULD THE INCREASE ACCESS AWARD

02:55:00.790 --> 02:55:02.658
AMOUNT IMPACT THOSE STUDENTS

02:55:02.725 --> 02:55:04.660
ELIGIBILITY FOR OTHER STATE

02:55:04.727 --> 02:55:06.529
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE CAL

02:55:06.596 --> 02:55:07.663
WORKS TANITH.

02:55:07.730 --> 02:55:08.898
WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A

02:55:08.965 --> 02:55:10.366
SCENARIO WHERE WE CREATE A CLIFF

02:55:10.433 --> 02:55:12.301
AFFECT WE GIVE THE MORE AID AND

02:55:12.368 --> 02:55:14.070
THEY DROP OFF THESE OTHER

02:55:14.136 --> 02:55:15.605
ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS SO WOULD

02:55:15.671 --> 02:55:17.173
THAT INCREASE.

02:55:17.240 --> 02:55:20.409
COMPROMISE THEIR ELIGIBILITY.

02:55:20.476 --> 02:55:22.044
RIGHT SO I WILL I'LL BRIEFLY

02:55:22.111 --> 02:55:22.845
TOUCH N THE ZERO TO THREE AND

02:55:22.912 --> 02:55:23.613
THEN I'LL TURN IT OVER TO MY

02:55:23.679 --> 02:55:25.514
COLLEAGUE CHRIS ON THE STUDENT

02:55:25.581 --> 02:55:27.083
AID AND PERFECT AND OTHER SOCIAL

02:55:27.149 --> 02:55:28.217
SERVICES OKAY.

02:55:28.284 --> 02:55:30.653
QUICK POINTS ON FIRST --

02:55:30.720 --> 02:55:32.622
AS YOU KNOW ONE GOOD THING IN

02:55:32.688 --> 02:55:33.389
ADDITION TO THE GOVERNOR'S ON

02:55:33.456 --> 02:55:34.824
COMMITMENT TO THESE ISSUES IS

02:55:34.891 --> 02:55:36.959
THAT THE NEW CHIEF OF STAFF AND

02:55:37.026 --> 02:55:37.593
ALL LERI --

02:55:37.660 --> 02:55:39.228
THIS IS HER LIFE'S WORK AND

02:55:39.295 --> 02:55:40.730
TERMS OF EARLY CHILDHOOD PAID

02:55:40.796 --> 02:55:43.499
FAMILY LEAVE IN MAKING SURE --

02:55:43.566 --> 02:55:44.133
I THINK SHE'S MORE FAMILIAR THAN

02:55:44.200 --> 02:55:47.270
ANYONE MONEY YOU'VE GOT THE

02:55:47.336 --> 02:55:48.604
PRESCHOOL PEOPLE VERSUS THE

02:55:48.671 --> 02:55:49.739
CHILD CARE PEOPLE IN YOUR AS

02:55:49.805 --> 02:55:51.340
FAMILIAR WITH THIS AS ANYONE

02:55:51.407 --> 02:55:52.642
CITING ONE PRIORITY OF THIS

02:55:52.708 --> 02:55:54.210
BUDGET WAS MAKING SURE THAT

02:55:54.277 --> 02:55:55.878
THERE IS ENOUGH FOR EVERYONE AND

02:55:55.945 --> 02:55:57.246
IT'S NOT SIMPLY FIGHTING.

02:55:57.313 --> 02:55:58.514
FOR SCRAPS OF DOLLARS HERE AND

02:55:58.581 --> 02:55:59.982
THERE BUT IT'S ALL CONNECTED TO

02:56:00.049 --> 02:56:01.717
EACH OTHER AND I THINK YOU KNOW

02:56:01.784 --> 02:56:02.685
WE'VE GOT OUR PRESCHOOL

02:56:02.752 --> 02:56:04.120
INVESTMENT WHICH AS YOU KNOW IT

02:56:04.186 --> 02:56:05.688
IS ALMOST A HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE

02:56:05.755 --> 02:56:06.689
MILLION DOLLARS --

02:56:06.756 --> 02:56:08.524
BUT WE ALSO SEE YOU KNOW THERE

02:56:08.591 --> 02:56:09.525
ARE IN OTHER FOR EXAMPLE NEW

02:56:09.592 --> 02:56:10.927
YORK CITY HAS UNIVERSAL

02:56:10.993 --> 02:56:12.495
PRESCHOOL FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLD

02:56:12.561 --> 02:56:13.496
SO THEY'RE ACTUALLY NOW

02:56:13.562 --> 02:56:14.697
EXTENDING TARA THREE YEAR OLD

02:56:14.764 --> 02:56:15.898
TUNE IN THE STATE BUDGET WE

02:56:15.965 --> 02:56:17.199
DON'T HAVE THAT ROOM YET ITS

02:56:17.266 --> 02:56:18.267
ASPIRATIONAL.

02:56:18.334 --> 02:56:20.069
BUT WE'RE HOPING FOR ZERO TO

02:56:20.136 --> 02:56:22.338
THREE BETWEEN THE HOME VISITING.

02:56:22.405 --> 02:56:24.106
AND THE ACCESS TO CHILD CARE

02:56:24.173 --> 02:56:25.141
WHICH WILL BE A LONGER TERM

02:56:25.207 --> 02:56:26.642
PROPOSITION BUT WHEN THAT FIVE

02:56:26.709 --> 02:56:27.209
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IN

02:56:27.276 --> 02:56:29.312
FUNDING THAT WILL PAVE THE WAY

02:56:29.378 --> 02:56:30.613
TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

02:56:30.680 --> 02:56:31.814
SUPPORTING KIDS NOT JUST ONCE

02:56:31.881 --> 02:56:33.215
THEY TURN FOUR YEARS OLD BUT

02:56:33.282 --> 02:56:34.583
EVEN BEFORE THAT AN EXCELLENT WE

02:56:34.650 --> 02:56:34.784
WILL.

02:56:34.850 --> 02:56:35.751
CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION

02:56:35.818 --> 02:56:37.253
BECAUSE THE OTHER ISSUE WITH

02:56:37.320 --> 02:56:38.788
REGARD TO PRESCHOOL IS IN A

02:56:38.854 --> 02:56:40.356
PRESCHOOL --

02:56:40.423 --> 02:56:41.724
ARE STATE FUNDED PRESCHOOL

02:56:41.791 --> 02:56:44.093
PROGRAMS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS NOW

02:56:44.160 --> 02:56:47.363
OR UNDER UTILIZED BECAUSE STATE

02:56:47.430 --> 02:56:48.798
PRESCHOOL IS THREE HOURS.

02:56:48.864 --> 02:56:50.967
AND I DON'T KNOW MANY WORKING

02:56:51.033 --> 02:56:52.768
MOMS WHO QUALIFY FOR STATE

02:56:52.835 --> 02:56:54.603
PRESCHOOL WHO HAD THE LUXURY OF

02:56:54.670 --> 02:56:56.238
ONLY WORKING THREE HOURS A DAY.

02:56:56.305 --> 02:56:58.374
AND SO IF THE PROGRAM DOESN'T

02:56:58.441 --> 02:56:59.642
INCLUDE --

02:56:59.709 --> 02:57:02.144
WRAPAROUND AND FULL DAY OPTIONS

02:57:02.211 --> 02:57:04.880
ONCE AGAIN THIS INVESTMENT WILL

02:57:04.947 --> 02:57:06.382
NOT HAVE BE AND THE WHY THIS

02:57:06.449 --> 02:57:08.084
WEEK OF MAY BECAUSE IT'LL GO

02:57:08.150 --> 02:57:09.051
UNDER YOU LIES IN STATE

02:57:09.118 --> 02:57:10.786
PRESCHOOL DOLLARS WILL COME BACK.

02:57:10.853 --> 02:57:15.324
AT THE END OF THE YEAR LIKE THEY

02:57:15.391 --> 02:57:18.461
HAVE DONE. FOR YEARS BECAUSE THE

02:57:18.527 --> 02:57:19.395
PROGRAMS THAT ARE UTILIZED

02:57:19.462 --> 02:57:20.363
BECAUSE IT'S NOT MEETING THE

02:57:20.429 --> 02:57:23.332
CURRENT NEED OF THE WORK FORCE

02:57:23.399 --> 02:57:25.134
SELF I'LL LOOK FOR TO HAVE THAT

02:57:25.201 --> 02:57:26.135
ONGOING CONVERSATIONS.

02:57:26.202 --> 02:57:27.203
AND WE KNOW WE HAVE AN ISSUE

02:57:27.269 --> 02:57:28.604
EVEN WITH KINDERGARTEN LET ALONE

02:57:28.671 --> 02:57:30.106
PRESCHOOL ABSOLUTELY BUT ONE

02:57:30.172 --> 02:57:30.973
POINT I WILL MAKE IS THIS NEW

02:57:31.040 --> 02:57:32.341
MONEY FOR PRESCHOOL THESE ARE

02:57:32.408 --> 02:57:34.477
FOR FULL DAY FOR YOUR PRESCHOOL

02:57:34.543 --> 02:57:36.178
SLOTS.

02:57:36.245 --> 02:57:38.948
EXCELLENT YES AND ON CHRIS ON

02:57:39.015 --> 02:57:39.482
THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION

02:57:39.548 --> 02:57:40.016
CERTAINLY.

02:57:40.082 --> 02:57:40.583
SO WILL --

02:57:40.649 --> 02:57:41.117
CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE

02:57:41.183 --> 02:57:42.051
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES ON

02:57:42.118 --> 02:57:45.521
THE QUESTION MY A CODED MEMO THE

02:57:45.588 --> 02:57:46.956
CAME FROM KIM JOHNSON AT THE

02:57:47.023 --> 02:57:48.557
DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES.

02:57:48.624 --> 02:57:49.859
THINK IT WAS IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN

02:57:49.925 --> 02:57:51.627
CLARIFIED THAT CAL GRANTS THAT

02:57:51.694 --> 02:57:53.429
ARE PROVIDED --

02:57:53.496 --> 02:57:55.164
TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE CAL WORKS

02:57:55.231 --> 02:57:57.400
PROGRAM AND WAR CALPERS PROGRAM

02:57:57.466 --> 02:57:59.101
ARE EXEMPT FROM THE INCOME SIDE

02:57:59.168 --> 02:58:00.503
OF THAT EQUATION.

02:58:00.569 --> 02:58:02.104
AND DO NOT IMPACT --

02:58:02.171 --> 02:58:03.472
BUT WILL CERTAINLY FOLLOW UP

02:58:03.539 --> 02:58:04.673
WITH THE DEPARTMENT --

02:58:04.740 --> 02:58:07.676
ON THAT ASPECT.

02:58:07.743 --> 02:58:14.650
I APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible]

02:58:14.717 --> 02:58:15.618
FIFTY IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE

02:58:15.684 --> 02:58:16.886
THAT AS WE INCREASE THE CHAFEE

02:58:16.952 --> 02:58:18.587
GRASSES THAT DOESN'T COMPROMISE

02:58:18.654 --> 02:58:21.023
THEIR OTHER OKAY.

02:58:21.090 --> 02:58:21.824
WILL FOLLOW UP ON THAT.

02:58:21.891 --> 02:58:24.126
WELL LAST QUESTION FOR ME DEALS

02:58:24.193 --> 02:58:25.061
WITH CAL FRESH VERY SENSITIVE

02:58:25.127 --> 02:58:26.395
SUBJECT WITH THE FEDERAL

02:58:26.462 --> 02:58:27.129
GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN.

02:58:27.196 --> 02:58:34.770
OF TWO QUESTIONS --

02:58:34.837 --> 02:58:35.871
WHAT EFFORTS --

02:58:35.938 --> 02:58:37.039
HAS THE ADMINISTRATION GAUGE AND

02:58:37.106 --> 02:58:38.074
TO ENSURE THAT RECIPIENTS

02:58:38.140 --> 02:58:39.041
RECEIVE THEIR BENEFITS WITH THIS

02:58:39.108 --> 02:58:40.242
LITTLE DESTRUCT DESTRUCTION AS

02:58:40.309 --> 02:58:42.378
POSSIBLE DESPITE THE SHUT DOWN

02:58:42.445 --> 02:58:45.147
DO YOU HAVE A PLAN AND AND CAN

02:58:45.214 --> 02:58:46.382
THE LEGISLATURE BE HELPFUL.

02:58:46.449 --> 02:58:48.818
SO ON CAL FOR SPECIFICALLY WE

02:58:48.884 --> 02:58:49.819
BELIEVE --

02:58:49.885 --> 02:58:50.886
AND ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES CAN

02:58:50.953 --> 02:58:53.422
SPEAK IN MORE DETAIL THAT --

02:58:53.489 --> 02:58:54.623
MONEY --

02:58:54.690 --> 02:58:55.458
AFTER JANUARY TWENTIETH WHICH IT

02:58:55.524 --> 02:58:56.425
WITH THREE DAYS FROM NOW ON

02:58:56.492 --> 02:58:58.360
SHOULD BE ABLE TO FIND BENEFITS

02:58:58.427 --> 02:58:59.562
THROUGH THE END OF FEBRUARY

02:58:59.628 --> 02:59:01.497
THAT'S OUR MOST RECENT ESTIMATE

02:59:01.564 --> 02:59:03.432
SO IT GIVES US FIVE OR SIX WEEKS.

02:59:03.499 --> 02:59:05.301
ON THE TRUTH IS WE DON'T KNOW

02:59:05.367 --> 02:59:08.771
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN FITS CON

02:59:08.838 --> 02:59:09.738
MAN -- FOR

02:59:09.805 --> 02:59:10.673
IN TERMS OF BENEFITS DELIVER TO

02:59:10.739 --> 02:59:12.675
PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT FIVE

02:59:12.741 --> 02:59:13.242
HUNDRED TWENTY FIVE MILLION

02:59:13.309 --> 02:59:14.376
DOLLARS A MONTH --

02:59:14.443 --> 02:59:15.778
SO IT'S A BIG DIFFERENCE AND

02:59:15.845 --> 02:59:17.346
IT'S DIFFERENT FROM UNEMPLOYMENT

02:59:17.413 --> 02:59:17.913
WHERE --

02:59:17.980 --> 02:59:19.348
THERE'S THE MONEY FLOWS

02:59:19.415 --> 02:59:21.183
DIFFERENTLY SO WE ARE EVALUATING

02:59:21.250 --> 02:59:22.852
OPTIONS RIGHT NOW WE HAD

02:59:22.918 --> 02:59:23.385
MEETINGS ON THE SHUT DOWN

02:59:23.452 --> 02:59:24.386
YESTERDAY --

02:59:24.453 --> 02:59:25.488
IT'S SOMETHING WHERE WE DON'T

02:59:25.554 --> 02:59:27.356
HAVE A PLAN JUST YET FOR POST

02:59:27.423 --> 02:59:29.859
FEBRUARY BUT WORK CLOSELY

02:59:29.925 --> 02:59:32.328
MONITORING HOW I CAN ADD

02:59:32.394 --> 02:59:35.164
ADDITIONAL DETAIL.

02:59:35.231 --> 02:59:36.465
THAT COVERS MOST THE TYRANTS

02:59:36.532 --> 02:59:37.066
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I JUST

02:59:37.133 --> 02:59:38.267
THEY WERE CONTINUING TO MONITOR

02:59:38.334 --> 02:59:39.101
THE SITUATION AS MY COLLEAGUE

02:59:39.168 --> 02:59:39.902
JUST MENTION THESE ARE FEDERAL

02:59:39.969 --> 02:59:41.237
BENEFITS WE ANTICIPATE TO BE

02:59:41.303 --> 02:59:41.971
ABLE.

02:59:42.037 --> 02:59:42.972
TO CONTINUE FULLY FINING THEM

02:59:43.038 --> 02:59:44.106
THROUGH FEBRUARY AS FAR AS A

02:59:44.173 --> 02:59:45.908
CONTINGENCY PLAN ON GOING AFTER

02:59:45.975 --> 02:59:46.742
THAT.

02:59:46.809 --> 02:59:48.277
LED TO FIGURE OUT IF IT LOOKS

02:59:48.344 --> 02:59:49.879
LIKE THE SHUT DOWN IS GOING TO

02:59:49.945 --> 02:59:51.013
CONTINUE OKAY [inaudible]

02:59:51.080 --> 02:59:53.282
OKAY [inaudible]

02:59:53.349 --> 02:59:57.086
SENATE BILL.

02:59:57.153 --> 02:59:57.953
WELL JUST.

02:59:58.020 --> 02:59:58.587
THINK WE HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

02:59:58.654 --> 03:00:00.489
FOOD ISSUE IS A CRISIS OF

03:00:00.556 --> 03:00:02.591
MAGNITUDE OF HUGE MAGNITUDE IF

03:00:02.658 --> 03:00:04.193
THIS WHOLE THING CONTINUES.

03:00:04.260 --> 03:00:05.794
OUR WE HAVE TO MOBILIZE THE

03:00:05.861 --> 03:00:08.364
COMMUNITY TO GET FOOD TO PEOPLE.

03:00:08.430 --> 03:00:08.898
IF YOU DON'T HAVE FOOD YOU

03:00:08.964 --> 03:00:11.133
STARVE.

03:00:11.200 --> 03:00:12.468
AND I THINK WE HAVE TO GET THE

03:00:12.535 --> 03:00:13.402
COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS

03:00:13.469 --> 03:00:17.072
MOBILIZED --

03:00:17.139 --> 03:00:23.879
I WAS A LITTLE BOY MY MOM USED

03:00:44.233 --> 03:00:46.168

03:00:55.477 --> 03:00:57.112
THE THAT ONE AROUND.

03:00:57.179 --> 03:00:58.981
GOD PEOPLE TO DONATE THE FOOD.

03:00:59.048 --> 03:01:00.849
AND THEY WOULD GET IT IN BAGS.

03:01:00.916 --> 03:01:01.951
AND THEN THEY WOULD LOADED IN

03:01:02.017 --> 03:01:03.519
THE CAR AS THEY HAD A LINE UP OF

03:01:03.586 --> 03:01:04.687
CARS THAT COME IN.

03:01:04.753 --> 03:01:06.155
THEY LOAD UP THE CARS AND THEN

03:01:06.222 --> 03:01:07.723
THEY TAKE IT TO PEOPLE'S HOMES.

03:01:07.790 --> 03:01:12.661
AND SHE SAID YOU KNOW THE AT OUR

03:01:12.728 --> 03:01:13.696
CAR.

03:01:13.762 --> 03:01:14.530
AND I DON'T KNOW I DON'T EVER I

03:01:14.597 --> 03:01:18.634
WAS LIKE TEN YEARS OLD.

03:01:18.701 --> 03:01:22.338
SHE SAID IT WAS SAYS ARE TRAVIS.

03:01:22.404 --> 03:01:25.441
IN SAN JOSE.

03:01:25.507 --> 03:01:25.774
WHEN HE WAS --

03:01:25.841 --> 03:01:28.210
SO USED TO LOAD GROCERIES IN MY

03:01:28.277 --> 03:01:31.814
MOM'S CAR.

03:01:31.880 --> 03:01:34.650
HISTORY CALIFORNIA THERE IS A

03:01:34.717 --> 03:01:36.819
RENEWED IMMOBILIZING.

03:01:36.885 --> 03:01:37.853
THE LEAGUE WE THAT WE GOT TO GET

03:01:37.920 --> 03:01:39.655
THE COMMUNITY.

03:01:39.722 --> 03:01:40.990
MOBILIZED TO FOOD BANKS ALL THE

03:01:41.056 --> 03:01:41.890
NOTE THE THE SOCIAL SERVICE

03:01:41.957 --> 03:01:43.325
ORGANIZATIONS. TO PREVENT PEOPLE

03:01:43.392 --> 03:01:45.661
FROM HAVING ANY KIND OF FOOD.

03:01:45.728 --> 03:01:48.864
PROBLEM THAT'S THAT'S OF THAT

03:01:48.931 --> 03:01:50.432
SORT ESSENTIAL.

03:01:50.499 --> 03:01:51.934
FRANTICALLY FOR THE TOWER CAN.

03:01:52.001 --> 03:01:52.935
CORRECT ME BUT I THINK ONE POINT

03:01:53.002 --> 03:01:54.069
TWO MILLION PEOPLE ARE ACCESSING

03:01:54.136 --> 03:01:55.471
CALPERS BENEFITS ON A MONTHLY

03:01:55.537 --> 03:01:57.206
BASIS NOT ONLY IS THAT YOU KNOW

03:01:57.273 --> 03:01:57.840
FIVE TIMES THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE

03:01:57.906 --> 03:01:58.307
THE STATE EMPLOYEES.

03:01:58.374 --> 03:01:58.941
I BELIEVE IT'S ACTUALLY MORE

03:01:59.008 --> 03:01:59.508
THAN THE NUMBER OF FEDERAL

03:01:59.575 --> 03:02:00.743
WORKERS --

03:02:00.809 --> 03:02:01.844
FOR WHAT NATIONALLY YES THAT'S

03:02:01.910 --> 03:02:03.012
THE SCALE OF THE ISSUE THAT

03:02:03.078 --> 03:02:03.979
WE'RE DEALING WITH THEM AT THE

03:02:04.046 --> 03:02:05.147
SAME TIME THAT FIVE HUNDRED

03:02:05.214 --> 03:02:06.815
MILLION DOLLARS A MONTH YOU KNOW

03:02:06.882 --> 03:02:07.650
IF THIS WERE TO GO ON FOR

03:02:07.716 --> 03:02:08.717
SEVERAL MONTHS YOU'RE TALKING

03:02:08.784 --> 03:02:10.719
SEVERAL BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TAX

03:02:10.786 --> 03:02:12.554
GIVEN THE STRUCTURE OF THE WAY

03:02:12.621 --> 03:02:12.755
THAT.

03:02:12.821 --> 03:02:14.890
PROGRAM STRUCTURE COMPARED TO

03:02:14.957 --> 03:02:17.159
EVEN TEMPORARY BUT MORE

03:02:17.226 --> 03:02:19.061
COMPLICATED TO IMAGINE HOW THAT

03:02:19.128 --> 03:02:20.763
CAN BE REIMBURSED ON AND EVEN IN

03:02:20.829 --> 03:02:22.865
A BUDGET AS ROBUST AS OURS YOU

03:02:22.931 --> 03:02:23.766
KNOW I'M NOT SURE THAT WE CAN

03:02:23.832 --> 03:02:25.234
ABSORB THAT KIND OF HIT OVER

03:02:25.301 --> 03:02:26.402
MULTIPLE MINE SO I THINK IT

03:02:26.468 --> 03:02:27.303
REALLY IS SOMETHING AS YOU.

03:02:27.369 --> 03:02:28.637
MENTIONED SENATOR WHERE WE

03:02:28.704 --> 03:02:29.838
REALLY NEED TO WORK WITH LOCAL

03:02:29.905 --> 03:02:31.540
ORGANIZATIONS AND NON PROFITS

03:02:31.607 --> 03:02:32.641
AND MAYBE SOME OF OUR PRIVATE

03:02:32.708 --> 03:02:34.510
SECTOR PARTNERS CAN STEP UP AND

03:02:34.576 --> 03:02:35.811
THEN OF COURSE AND I THINK YOU

FIRST PLACE THAT'S THAT'S THE

03:02:44.453 --> 03:02:44.620

IN LAST YEAR'S BUDGET THAT MADE

03:02:53.629 --> 03:02:55.964
SSI RECIPIENTS ELIGIBLE FOR

03:02:56.031 --> 03:02:57.533
FEDERAL CALVET COW FOR ACTION SO

03:02:57.599 --> 03:03:00.035

COULD BE AT RISK.

03:03:07.042 --> 03:03:08.344
ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

03:03:08.410 --> 03:03:09.478
POLICY -- I

03:03:09.545 --> 03:03:10.746
HAVE THERE BEEN ANY CHALLENGES

03:03:10.813 --> 03:03:11.613
THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS

03:03:11.680 --> 03:03:15.284
EXPERIENCED IN IMPLEMENTING THAT.

03:03:15.351 --> 03:03:18.354
ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES BECAUSE THE

03:03:18.420 --> 03:03:19.588
ONE POINT IN THAT THIS TO BUDGET

03:03:19.655 --> 03:03:20.289
IS DIFFERENT AS MAKING IT ON

03:03:20.356 --> 03:03:21.557
GOING RATHER THAN ONE TIME AND

03:03:21.623 --> 03:03:22.491

MAKE SURE THAT.

03:03:28.697 --> 03:03:30.165
THAT THE ONE TIME FUNDS WERE

03:03:33.635 --> 03:03:34.002
IT SOUNDS LIKE --

03:03:34.069 --> 03:03:35.070
THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN IS THAT

03:03:35.137 --> 03:03:37.873
WE WILL BE READY TO GO AT THIS

03:03:37.940 --> 03:03:38.874
