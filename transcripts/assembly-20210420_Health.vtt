IT PERHAPS SHOULD HAVE BEEN A

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:48.003
TO YOUR BILL- BUT FAILURE TO

01:11:48.070 --> 01:11:50.305
PASS A BILL THIS YEAR- THAT

01:11:50.372 --> 01:11:51.907
DOES NOT MEAN CALIFORNIA GETS A

01:11:51.974 --> 01:11:54.276
PASS ON THE IMPLEMENTATION-

01:11:54.343 --> 01:11:56.612

AND WHAT FAILURE TO PASS A BILL

01:11:58.580 --> 01:11:59.815
WOULD MEAN IS CALIFORNIA WILL

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:01.717
BE FORCED TO RESPOND WITHOUT

IN PLACE. PUTTING TREMENDOUS

01:12:04.319 --> 01:12:05.421

CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION WOULD

01:12:19.201 --> 01:12:21.136
MEAN CALLS GO UNANSWERED PEOPLE

01:12:21.203 --> 01:12:22.971
MAY NOT RECEIVE NEEDED CARE AND

01:12:23.038 --> 01:12:24.306
OUTCOMES FOR CALLERS COULD BE

01:12:24.373 --> 01:12:26.141

TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE TESTED

RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES. IT'S

04:15:40.758 --> 04:15:43.761
BEEN THAT. THERE IS A LACK OF

04:15:43.828 --> 04:15:45.263
COMMITMENT OF DELIVERY OF

04:15:47.899 --> 04:15:50.334
INDUSTRY WIDE. THERE ARE SOME

PLAYERS THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF

04:15:52.236 --> 04:15:53.938
THE OPPORTUNITY THAT'S WHY

04:15:54.005 --> 04:15:56.607
WE'VE HAD SUCH VULNERABILITY.

04:15:56.674 --> 04:15:59.510

ABOUT A DOZEN DIFFERENT

04:16:13.091 --> 04:16:16.661
SUGGESTIONS. OF HOW WE CAN.

04:16:16.728 --> 04:16:18.563
CREATE AN ENVIRONMENT WHERE

04:16:18.629 --> 04:16:20.832
CARE OF THE AGING POPULATION IN

04:16:20.898 --> 04:16:22.934
THESE FACILITIES IS AT THE

04:16:23.000 --> 04:16:27.705
FOREFRONT. OF. WHAT WHAT

04:16:27.772 --> 04:16:30.641
THEY'RE DESIGNED TO DO AND THAT

04:16:30.708 --> 04:16:31.209
THE DELIVER THE BEST SERVICE

04:16:31.275 --> 04:16:33.411
POSSIBLE. UNFORTUNATELY WHAT'S

04:16:33.478 --> 04:16:35.079
HAPPENED COLLEAGUES IS THAT

04:16:35.146 --> 04:16:36.614
WHEN YOU LOOK AT A LOT OF THESE

04:16:36.681 --> 04:16:40.051
CENTERS. MOST OF THEM ARE MONEY

04:16:40.118 --> 04:16:41.686
MAKERS BECAUSE THEY GET A

04:16:41.753 --> 04:16:43.054
CERTAIN SET SET AMOUNT FROM THE

04:16:43.121 --> 04:16:46.124
STATE. AND IT BECOMES A REAL

04:16:46.190 --> 04:16:47.992
ESTATE VENTURE AT SOME POINT.

04:16:48.059 --> 04:16:49.761
BECAUSE THEY WOULD RATHER MAKE

04:16:49.827 --> 04:16:51.562
THE INVESTMENT INTO THE REAL

04:16:51.629 --> 04:16:53.831
ESTATE PORTION OF THE BUSINESS.

04:16:53.898 --> 04:17:00.037
AND AT SOME POINT WHEN. THEY'VE

04:17:00.104 --> 04:17:01.606
MADE THE PURCHASED OR ACQUIRED

04:17:01.672 --> 04:17:03.941
THE LAND THEY CAN EASILY

04:17:04.008 --> 04:17:05.309
MANEUVER OUT AND DO SOMETHING

04:17:05.376 --> 04:17:08.513
ELSE YEAH SO THIS WAS YET ONE

04:17:08.579 --> 04:17:10.882
MORE STEP IN MAKING SURE THAT

04:17:10.948 --> 04:17:12.216
THERE WAS A FIRM COMMITMENT

04:17:12.283 --> 04:17:13.818
FROM THE BUSINESS. THAT IT'S

04:17:13.885 --> 04:17:15.653
NOT CONTRACTING OUT THAT IT IS

04:17:15.720 --> 04:17:17.822
HIRING SOMEONE. THAT IS

04:17:17.889 --> 04:17:19.557
QUALIFIED AND IS CERTIFIED AND

04:17:19.624 --> 04:17:21.092
IT'S GOING TO CONTINUE AND I
