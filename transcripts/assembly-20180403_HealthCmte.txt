LOOKING AROUND HERE WE HAVE WE DO HAVE AN AUTHOR MISTER KALRA WHICH LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR BILL MISTER CALDERON YOU BE PRESENTING AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE CORRECT IF I WAS TO LISTEN. START WITH TWENTY TO THIRTY THREE I THINK I'M SORRY HOW TO BILLS I APOLOGIZE THINK I'M SORRY. I DO AS CHAIR KNEW THAT THAT WAS YESTERDAY OKAY SO. PLEASE AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THIRTY THREE EXCUSE ME TWENTY TO THIRTY THREE. THANK YOU ASSURE MEMBERS. AS CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE ON AGING OVER THE FALL I HELD A NUMBER OF INFORMATION HEARINGS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE INCLUDING ONE IN SAN DIEGO. THAT WAS IN REGARDS SUPPORTIVE SERVICES FOR SENIORS AT HOME IN THE COMMUNITY. WAS OF THAT HER A HEARING THAT WE LEARNED IN DETAIL ABOUT A PROGRAM WHICH TAKES SENIORS FROM A NURSING HOME. OF GOOD IT DOES NOT CERTAIN NEED THAT LEVEL OF CARE AND PLACE THEM IN ASSISTED LIVING FACILITIES OR. ALLOW SENIORS TO REMAIN AT HOME WITH THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. OR HOW SOMEONE THAT'S AT HOME THAT NEEDS TO BE IN SOME TYPE OF ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. IN THESE CASES. THEY. BENEFIT THE STATE BY BOARDING THE HIGH COST OF A NURSING HOME ESPECIALLY IS THAT LEVEL OF CARE IS UNNECESSARY AND PROVIDES A COSTUMES IS STATE IN DOING SO. THE PROGRAM IS THIS IS A LIVING WAIVER. CURRENTLY THE DEMAND FOR THE A LW PROGRAM HAS OUTPACED SUPPLY AND OPERATES THE WAY THIS WILL PROBABLY TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED INDIVIDUALS ACROSS FIFTEEN COUNTIES. ACCORDING TO THE TWENTY SEVENTEEN LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORT SCORECARD ALMOST ELEVEN PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S UNDER ONE THOUSAND NURSING HOME RESIDENTS ARE ELEVEN THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS. ARE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING LOW CARE NEEDS THESE INDIVIDUALS COULD BE CARED FOR AT HOME IN THEIR COMMUNITY WORN ASSISTED LIVING CITING AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO LICENSE HEALTHCARE FACILITIES. I HAD VISITED. SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND HAVE BEEN TOLD US VERY DIRECTLY BY SOME OF THE MANAGEMENT THAT THEY WISHED AT ANOTHER PLACE. THAT THE SOME OF THE PATIENTS COULD GO THEY DIDN'T NEED THAT COST ABOUT LEVEL CARE. I HAVE A FURTHER MORE. THEY'LL W. PROGRAM FACE NUMBER CHALLENGES TO PREVENT THE PROGRAM FROM REALIZING ITS POTENTIAL INCLUDING LACK OF AVAILABLE PROVIDERS. LOW REIMBURSEMENT RATES AND HAMPER PROVIDER PARTICIPATION LACK OF STATEWIDE OF AVAILABILITY ND INEFFECTIVE ADMINISTRATION A MINISTRY OF REQUIREMENTS. AND AB TWENTY TO THIRTY THREE IS AN ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS ALL THESE ISSUES AB TWENTY TO THIRTY THREE WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF SLOTS AVAILABLE AND THEY'LL W. PROGRAM BY UP TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED. EXPAND GEOGRAPHIC REPRESENTATION OF THE PROGRAM ON A REGIONAL BASIS OUTLINED REQUIREMENTS FOR STAKEHOLDER PROCESS. AND CRITICALLY ADDRESS VARIOUS PROGRAMMATIC ELEMENTS THAT IMPACT ITS EFFECTIVENESS. AB MEMBERS IS ONE OF THOSE UNIQUE PROGRAMS AVOIDS THE HIGH COST OF NURSING HOME STAYS SAVES THE STATE'S. THE STATE MONEY AND ONE THAT WE SHOULD EXPAND AND IMPROVE. ULTIMATELY THESE AND RISKY BETTER CARED FOR AB PLUS CASA PLACING PEOPLE IN A SETTING IN WHICH THEY BELONG I'M VERY GRATEFUL TO THE GOVERNOR. AND HIS PROPOSED BUDGET PRT PROPOSES INCREASING AT THE SLOTS BY TWO THOUSAND AND IN FACT THAT INCREASE OF TWO THOUSAND SLOTS. WILL BE SAVING THE STATE MILLIONS OF DOLLARS BECAUSE THOSE IN SKILLED NURSING WILL BE GIVEN THE FIRST PRIORITY. AND SO THIS PROGRAM EVEN BY INCREASING IT. IT IN THE THE YEARS TO COME TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE CASA BALL DOES HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY ALSO CREATE COST SAVINGS. I HAVE WITH ME TODAY I GEORGE CANARIAN OF SIX BEDS AND AIR CARLOS AND WOOD JUSTICE AN AGING TO TESTIFY AND HELP ANY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE. GO AHEAD GRATED LIKE ABOUT IT. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR VICE CHAIR MEMBERS MY NAME IS GEORGE TICKNER AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING SIX BEDS WHICH IS A STATEWIDE TRADE ORGANIZATION THE REPRESENTS OVER TWO THOUSAND RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. AND ADULT RESIDENTIAL FACILITIES SERVING SIX OR FEWER PERSONS. SIX BUT FACILITIES PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THE ALE W. PROGRAM REPRESENTING APPROXIMATELY FIFTY PERCENT OF THE HELD OF YOU PROVIDERS. I'D LIKE TO START UP I THINK IN THE AUTHOR ASSEMBLY MEMBER KALRA FOR INTRODUCING THIS BILL. AND CHAMPIONING THE ISSUE OF IMPROVING THEY'LL BE PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM'S YET TO SCRATCH THE SURFACE OF ITS POTENTIAL KEY ASPECTS OF THIS BILL WILL HELP THE ELDERLY TAKES STEPS TOWARDS REACHING THE POTENTIAL ITS POTENTIAL IN A COUPLE OF AREAS. FIRST INCREASING THE CAPACITY OF THE PROGRAM TO EIGHTEEN THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED SLOTS IN CONJUNCTION WITH GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION REPRESENTS A MAJOR STEP TOWARD ACHIEVING GREATER AND TIMELY OR CONSUMER ACCESS TO THE PROGRAM. EVEN IF YOU ADD ENOUGH SLOTS TO THE PROGRAM TO ABSORB THE CURRENT WAITLIST WHICH IS APPROACHING THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE. THERE IS NO MAGIC WAND TO GET AWAY THEN INSERT INSTANTANEOUSLY AND ROLLED THOSE PERSONS ON THE WAIT LIST. THOSE PERSONS HAVE THAT APPLICATION SUBMITTED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH THAT TO BE REVIEWED AND APPROVED. WE ESTIMATE THAT YES YES THE PROCESS ON AVERAGE ONE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS PER MONTH. IT'S REASONABLE TO ASSUME THEN. AS A RESULT TOO SOON AND THE DEPARTMENT TO TAKE OVER TWO YEARS TORO ALL PERSONS CURRENTLY ON THE WAITLIST. DURING THAT TIME ADDITIONAL PEOPLE WILL BE APPLYING TO ACCESS THE ALE W. AS THERE IS NO PAS BUTTON ON DEMAND. SO ANYTIME THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT WAIT LIST EVEN IF ADDITIONAL PROGRAMS LOTS ARE EVENTUALLY ADDED DE EIGHT CS FINDS ITSELF HAVING TO DIG OUT OF A HOLE. THE MOST NEGATIVELY IMPACTED ARE THE MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES WHILE LONG WAIT LISTS ARE PROBLEMATIC FOR CONSUMERS OF ANY HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED PROGRAM THERE ESPECIALLY PROP PROBLEMATIC FOR PROGRAM TO SERVE OLDER ADULTS. WHERE REMAINING LIFE EXPECTANCY IS OF REAL CONCERN? THE AVERAGE LENGTH OF STAY FOR ELDERLY PARTICIPANTS IS TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN DAYS OR A LITTLE OVER EIGHT MONTHS. IF IT TAKES TWO YEARS OR MORE TO PROCESS EVERYONE ON THE WAIT LIST IT'S REASONABLE TO CONCLUDE THEN THAT NOT EVERYONE ON THE WAIT LIST WILL SURVIVE THE WAIT. AND THAT IS A SHAME. THIS IS WHY IT'S IMPERATIVE THE LW STAY AHEAD OF THE DEMAND CURVE AS OPPOSED TO LAGGING BEHIND. LONG WEIGHTLESS IS ALSO DETRIMENTAL TO PROVIDER PARTICIPATION. WHEN THE A ALL OF YOU COME TO A GRINDING HALT FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME NEW PROVIDERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO ENROLL IN EXISTING PROVIDERS ARE LESS LIKELY TO CONTINUE PARTICIPATING OR WILL CHOOSE TO SCALE BACK THEIR PARTICIPATION. OFTEN CHOOSING TO USE THE LW ONLY TO FILL THOSE NUMBER OF BEDS IN THEIR FACILITIES ARE CHRONICALLY VACANT. AND SHORT UNLESS THERE ARE CHANGES PROVIDERS WILL LOSE TRUST IN THE PROGRAM. ALSO AFFECTING PROVIDER PARTICIPATION OUR REIMBURSEMENT RATES EXCEPT FOR THE MOST RECENT MINIMUM WAGE INCREASES TIGHT TO SP THREE. LW PROVIDER RATES HAVE BEEN STAGNANT WHEN THEY'LL BE WAS LAUNCHED AS A PILOT PROGRAM IN TWO THOUSAND SIX THE HOURLY MINIMUM WAGE WAS SIX SEVENTY FIVE. AS IT IT INCREASES SEVEN FIFTEEN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN TO EIGHT DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT TO NINE AND TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AND TO TEN DOLLARS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. PROVIDER RATES WERE NEVER ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THOSE INCREASES. ONE ELDERLY PROVIDER RATE BECOME UNCOMPETITIVE FACILITIES WILL INCREASINGLY FAVOR PRIVATE PAY CLIENTS OVER ALE W. CLIENTS. IN CLOSING INCREASING THEY'LL LOBBYIST CRISP CAPACITY EXPANDING ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH AND INCREASED PROVIDER RATES WILL CONTRIBUTE TO A MORE ROBUST PROVIDER ECOSYSTEM. WITH AN INCREASE IN BOTH THE BREADTH AND DEPTH THE PROVIDER PARTICIPATION IMPORTANTLY A MORE ROBUST PROVIDER ECOSYSTEM TRANSLATES. TO GREATER DIRECTLY TO GREATER ACCESS AND CONSUMER CHOICE FOR MEDI CAL BENEFICIARIES RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AYE VOTES. THANK YOU. SIR. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME'S ERIK KARLSSON I'M WITH JUSTICE AN AGING OF THE NONPROFIT. BASED IN OAKLAND AND LOS ANGELES THAT REPRESENTS INTERESTS OF OLDER CALIFORNIANS AND. AN OLDER AMERICANS I WANT TO SPEAK BRIEFLY ON. JUST TWO OR THREE ISSUES ONE IS TO POINT OUT OF COURSE OLDER CALIFORNIA'S OFTENTIMES. JUST PREFER ALTERNATIVES TO NURSING FACILITIES AND THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT THE PUBLIC FINANCING. STRUCTURE OF THE STATE DOESN'T UNDULY FAVOR SENDING PEOPLE TO NURSING FACILITIES RATHER THAN TO COMMUNITY BASED SETTINGS LIKE RESIDENTIAL CARE FACILITIES FOR THE ELDERLY. AND THAT'S THE THE RATIONALE BEHIND THIS BILL THEIR. SEE THE CURRENT CAP OF ENROLLMENT IS THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY JUST A DROP IN THE BUCKET. WHEN YOU COMPARE TO THE. TENS OF THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AGING CALIFORNIA'S WE'RE GONNA NEED SUCH ASSISTANCE. WE SPOKE ABOUT THE FINANCIAL SAVINGS. AND THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ESTIMATES THE ANNUAL COST OF NURSING FACILITY CARE AT SIXTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. IN THE ANNUAL COST OF ASSISTED LIVING SERVICES AT SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY SO THE STATE TABLE TO FUND FOUR PLUS. ASSISTED LIVING FOLKS RATHER THAN ONE NURSING FACILITY PERSON SO IT'S A WIN WIN FROM THE CONSUMER'S POINT OF VIEW FROM THE PROVIDERS POINT OF VIEW. AND I RESPECTFULLY SUGGEST FROM THE STATE'S POINT OF VIEW AS WELL. AND THEN OF A FINAL MENTION ABOUT SOME OF THE OF MAY BE LESS PROMINENT PROVISIONS OF THE BILL THE BILL ADDRESSES SOME IMPORTANT LOGISTICAL ISSUES RELATING TO THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE WAIT LIST. AND THE. THE EFFICACY OF THE FINANCIAL STANDARDS IT SOMEONE WHO'S WORKED IN THIS FIELD FOR LONG TIME I CAN TELL YOU THAT EVEN AMONG PEOPLE WHO. WORK IN IT THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW THE PROGRAM IS SUPPOSED TO OPERATE IN SOME REAL DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN HOW SUPPOSED OPERATE AND HOW IT DOES. AND IT THIS IS A TREMENDOUS OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES IN THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS IN THE RENEWAL OF THE WAIVER TO HAVE AN OPEN CONVERSATION BETWEEN D. H. C. OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS. SO THE PROGRAM WILL WORK WORK MUCH BETTER GOING FORWARD VERY MUCH AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OTHERS IN SUPPORT PLEASE USE YOUR NAME AND. ORGANIZATION PLEASE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FRED MADE ON BEHALF OF CAL PACE THE PROGRAM FOR. ALL INCLUSIVE CARE FOR THE ELDERLY. PROVIDING INTEGRATED CARE SO THAT FRAIL SENIORS CAN LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY.

HEATHER HARRISON WITH THE CALIFORNIA SYSTEM LIVING ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT. JEFF HAMPTON LEADING IT'S CALIFORNIA ALSO IN STRONG SUPPORT. LISA COLEMAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA LONG TERM CARE OMBUDSMAN ASSOCIATION WE WERE SO EXCITED TO HEAR THAT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS GONNA FORWARD THIS BILL. I GET PHONE CALLS FROM FAMILIES THAT ARE FRANTIC TRYING TO FIND PLACEMENT. AND I ALSO GET PHONE CALLS FROM SENIORS WHO ARE FRUSTRATED LIVING IN SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES BECAUSE THEY REALLY DON'T HAVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE THAT THEY COULD HAVE. AT COST SAVINGS TO THE STATE IF THEY WERE ALLOWED TO LEAVE IN ASSISTED LIVING SO WE CAN'T. WE JUST CAN'T SAY STRONGLY ENOUGH HOW MUCH WE SUPPORT THIS BILL. CAROL SUL FROM THE CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON AGING I. ECHO LEASES COMMENTS WE THINK THAT CREATING AS MANY OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO STAY IN COMMUNITY AS POSSIBLE. IS DEFINITELY. ECONOMICAL AND DESIRABLE THINK YOU. LINDA WAY WITH THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND IN THE VERY MUCH AS A SHARE MEMBERS I REALLY APPRECIATE IT AND I JUST KNOW TWO THINGS THAT. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT INCREASED NUMBER OF SLOTS THAT BY ITSELF WON'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM. ABOUT UPDATE DAILY MODERNIZING BUT. THE SAUDIS BECOME. ELIGIBLE SO IN THE PAST. FOR EXAMPLE MAY REQUIRE A KITCHENETTE WHILE SOME OF THE FOLKS ARE JUST LEARNING. IT WOULD NOW THAT IT WOULDN'T CAN EVEN USE ONE OR SHOULDN'T USE ONE ANYWAY AND YET. POSE SOME OF THESE OUTDATED REQUIREMENTS ARE KEEPING US FROM HAVING THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT OF STOCK OF POTENTIAL ASSIST LIVING FACILITIES SEKALI RIGHT NOW IT'S FIFTEEN COUNTIES THIS BILL WOULD EXPAND IT REGIONALLY THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S OF THOSE KINDS I DON'T CURRENTLY HAVE IT.

MOST OF TO THE BILL PASSES EIGHT ZERO THANK YOU VERY MUCH YES RECORDED I TOLD YOU TO APPRECIATE THAT WE DID WE DID THE ROLE. TO HER. THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT THIS POINT. THE NET. I'M SORRY ANOTHER BILL. YEAH. SO I. TRIED TO DO THAT BEFORE SO. I WOULD SAY AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE THAT'S CORRECT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH VERY MUCH I MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE WOULD REQUIRE MANUFACTURERS TO LIST ALL INGREDIENTS ON THE LABELS PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC PRODUCTS. EXCEPT FOR THOSE PROTECTED BY TRADE SECRETS TO PROVIDE OPEN INFORMATION FOR CONSUMERS LINE WORKERS AND THE GENERAL PUBLIC. IS IMPORTANT IN NO THE UNDER CURRENT LAW PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC PRODUCTS THOSE USES LAUNCH ON A DAILY BASIS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE LABELED. THIS BILL IS SIMPLY APPLY THE EXISTING INDUSTRY LABELING REQUIREMENT FOR RETAIL COSMETIC PRODUCTS. PROFESSIONAL COSMETICS. BOB VITO COSMETICS ARE SOLD TO THE PUBLIC FOR LIVESTOCK CONSUMPTION. SPECIAL COSMETIC PRODUCTS ARE USED BY SALON WORKERS FOR UPWARDS OF EIGHT HOURS PER DAY RESULTING IN MANY CASES OF ACUTE. DISAPPEAR HEALTH SYMPTOMS AB TWENTY SEVEN SEVENTY FIVE GIVE SALON WORKERS AND CONSUMERS THE ABILITY TO VIEW INGREDIENTS IN AN OPEN WAY THAT IS ALREADY CENTER DIES. ACROSS OUR FOOD HOME PRODUCTS AND RETAIL COSMETICS. SINCE MY INTRODUCTION OF THIS CONCEPT LAST YEAR. WE'VE REMOVED ALL OPPOSITION A PROBABLY PURSUE THEIR SUPPORT OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL AND THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE. FOR THOSE REASONS I ASKED WE AYE BOAT AND WE'RE GONNA LEAD OFF WITH. IP COULD MISTER CHAIR CATHERINE PORTER POLICY DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY MEALS LONG COLLABORATIVE. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN WOULD AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS. I AM CATHERINE PORTER POLICY DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA HEALTHY NAIL SALON COLLABORATIVE ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FIVE. IT CALLS FOR MORE TRANSPARENCY AND THE CHEMICAL INGREDIENTS IN PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC PRODUCTS. THEY CALIFORNIA HOPING ELSE ALONG COALITION IS. GROUP OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH AND JUSTICE AND WORKERS RIGHTS ORGANIZATIONS AND INDIVIDUAL NAIL SALON WORKERS AND OWNERS. THROUGH COMMUNITY LEADERSHIP PROGRAMS POLICY ADVOCACY AND OTHER ACTIVITIES WE WORK TO IMPROVE THE HEALTH SAFETY AND RIGHTS FOR THE PREDOMINANTLY VIETNAMESE IMMIGRANT WOMEN WORK FORCE IN NAIL SALONS. EVERY WORK DAY FOR LONG HOURS NAIL IN HERE SO ON WORKERS MANY IF NOT MOST OF WHOM ARE WOMEN OF REPRODUCTIVE AGE. YOU SOLVENTS GLUES POLISHES STRAIGHTENERS AND OTHER BEAUTY CARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING CHEMICALS KNOWN OR SUSPECTED TO CAUSE CANCER AND REPRODUCTIVE S. RESPIRATORY NEUROLOGICAL OR OTHER HARM. THESE EXPOSURES ARE EXPERIENCED ON TOP OF THOSE. FROM THEIR OWN DAILY USE OF PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS SHAMPOO LOTIONS HAIR DYES MAKEUP AND MORE. STUDIES SHOW THAT WOMEN IN THE SALON PROFESSIONS ARE AT GREATER RISK OF CANCER THAN THE GENERAL POPULATION. THIS IS ESPECIALLY ALARMING FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN SALON PROFESSIONALS AS AFRICAN AMERICAN WOMEN GENERALLY EXPERIENCE MORE AGGRESSIVE FORMS OF CANCER. HEARING NAIL SALON PROFESSIONALS MAY ALSO BE AT INCREASED RISK OF CERTAIN REPRODUCTIVE HARM SUCH AS LOW BIRTH WEIGHT BABIES AND OF RESPIRATORY PROBLEMS. OTHER MANUFACTURERS ARE LEGALLY REQUIRED TO LIST INGREDIENTS ON THE LABELS OF COSMETIC SOLD AT THE RETAIL LEVEL THEY HAVE NO SIMILAR LEGAL OBLIGATION WHEN IT COMES TO PROFESSIONAL COSMETICS. THIS LACK OF TRANSPARENCY HAMPERS BEAUTY PROFESSIONAL'S ABILITY TO MAKE INFORMED CHOICES ABOUT THE PRODUCTS THEY USE AND MEASURES THEY CAN TAKE TO PROTECT THEIR HEALTH. IT ALSO GETS IN THE WAY OF CUSTOMERS BEING ABLE TO KNOW ABOUT INGREDIENTS USED IN THESE PRODUCTS. AB TWO SEVEN SEVEN FIVE WILL FILL AND IMPROVE THIS LABELING POLICY GAP BY REQUIRING THAT MANUFACTURES LISTING GRADIENTS ON PROFESSIONAL COSMETIC CONTAINER LABELS. WE AND OUR CO SPONSORS BLACK WOMEN FOR WELLNESS WOMEN'S VOICES FOR THE EARTH AND BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS.

IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT ANYONE HIRED AFTER TWO DOZEN EIGHTEEN REPORT THE COUNTY THAT THEY HAVE REVIEWED THIS INFORMATION WITHIN NINETY DAYS TO THIS KIND OF.

WE REPRESENT PATIENTS INVOLUNTARILY HELD IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. WE RECEIVE INVESTIGATE COMPLAINTS OF RIGHTS VIOLATIONS. WE PROVIDE TRAININGS FOR MENTAL HEALTH PROVIDERS TO STAY COMPLIANT WITH REGULATIONS. AND WE INSURE PATIENTS AND LOCKED PSYCHIATRIC HOSPITALS ARE INFORMED OF THEIR RIGHTS. THE JOB OF THE PATIENTS RIGHTS ADMIT ADVOCATE IS TO PROTECT THE CIVIL RIGHTS MENTAL HEALTH CONSUMERS. THE GOAL OF OUR WORK IS TO PRESERVE PATIENT DIGNITY AND IMPROVE QUALITY OF CARE. AB TWENTY THIRTY THREE SIXTEEN WILL IMPROVE THE WORK OF COUNTY PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES BY MANDATING TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR PROFESSION. CURRENTLY THERE ARE NO MANDATED TRAINING REQUIREMENTS FOR OUR KIDS PROFESSION AND ADVOCATES COME FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF EMPLOYMENT BACKGROUNDS. IN A RECENT SURVEY TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF PATIENTS RIGHTS ADVOCATES STATED THEY RECEIVED NO TRAINING AT ALL. NINETY SIX PERCENT OF ADVOCATES.

ELEVEN ZERO YOU BILLS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A SEGMENT. NOW I BELIEVE. DOCTOR ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA WILL BE PRESENTING AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY WHICH IS A BILL TO HELP TO AIM TO RAISE THE INCOME LET LET LEVEL. FOR THE AGED AND DISABLED MEDICAL PROGRAM TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. CREATING PARITY BETWEEN SENIORS AND DISABLED MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES AND OTHER ADULT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THE ACA MOST ADULTS 䍐 THE MEDI CAL. IF THEY HAVE AN INCOME BELOW ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FPL WHICH IS JUST UNDER SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR AN INDIVIDUAL. THE ACA HOWEVER DID NOT CHANGE THE INCOME LEVEL FOR THE MEDI CAL AGED AND DISABLED PROGRAM. WHICH IS A HUNDRED PERCENT FPL PLUS TWO HUNDRED THIRTY DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL ONLY TWELVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS PER MONTH. AS OF NOW THAT'S EQUIVALENT TO ESSENTIALLY A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE. PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. THIS ALSO MEANS THAT A SIXTY FOUR YEAR OLD ADULTS WITH FREE MEDICAL. CAN LOSE IT THE DAY THEY TURN SIXTY FIVE YEARS OLD. A SENIOR WITH AN INCOME EVEN ONE DOLLAR OVER THE HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PERCENT THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL THRESHOLD. IS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAL WITH AN EXPENSIVE SHARE OF COST. THE ONLY WAY FOR THE SENIORS WITH INCOMES ABOVE A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PERCENT FPL. TO ACCESS MEDICAL BENEFITS IS TO PAY HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN A MONTHLY MEDI CAL SHARE OF COST. OF ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS PER MONTH WHICH MANY ARE UNABLE TO DO SO. THIS CREATE A SIGNIFICANT BARRIER TO HEALTHCARE FOR SENIORS TO ACCESS AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY ARE FORCED TO CHOOSE BETWEEN. PAYING FOR RENT AND FOOD FOR THEIR MEDI CAL SHARE OF COST. THIS FORCES MANY SENIORS TO FORGO NEEDED MEDICAL SERVICES COMPELLING THEM TO MOVE INTO SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AT HIGHER COST TO THE STATE. AND AN EVEN HIGHER PERSONAL COST TO THEIR OWN INDEPENDENCE AND WILL BE. RAISING THE AGE AND DISABLE INCOME LIMITS TWO HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL PARTY LIMIT IS THE SIMPLEST AND MOST COST EFFECTIVE WAY. TO ENSURE LOW INCOME SENIORS HAVE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE HEALTH. AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY WOULD ENSURE THAT THE VULNERABLE POPULATION OF LOW INCOME SENIORS ARE TREATED FAIRLY AND CAN HAVE ACCESS TO AFFORDABLE MEDICAL CARE. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT IS LINDA WAY WITH THE WESTERN CENTER FOR LAW AND POVERTY CLEAR RAMSEY FROM JUSTICE IN AGING AND ABROAD. NOW KURT TRIALS FROM DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. PLEASE AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY PROUD CO SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE. UNDER HEALTH REFORM ADULTS LIKE WITH INCOMES UP TO A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICAID HOW. EXCEPT FOR SENIORS INDIVIDUALS SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER ARE SUBJECT TO A LOWER INCOME ELIGIBILITY THRESHOLD OF A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. A DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. THAN TWELVE. TWELVE ENGINE FORTY TWO DOLLARS A MONTH HERE SHE CAN ONLY GET MEDI CAL WITH THE SHARE OF COSTS MEANING. THEY HAVE TO BUT I PAY. I THEIR INCOME MINUS SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS HOT BEFORE MEDICARE HOW KICKS AND A THIS IS BASED ON THE ANTIQUATED IDEA THAT PEOPLE CAN LIVE OFF OF SIX HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH. THIS MIGHT HAVE BEEN TRUE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE WHEN THERE SIX HUNDRED DOLLAR MITNICK STEVE INCOME LEVEL WAS ESTABLISHED BASED CERTAINLY NOT TRUE TODAY. THAT THAT THE GRASS THAT THAT I HAS BEEN SHARED WITH YOU WAS. GRAPH RELEASED BY THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET. UP POLICY CENTER JUST TODAY SHOWING THAT END OF. WHAT A BAD BIRTH YEAR A SIXTY FIVE CAN BE IT SHOWS THAT AN INDIVIDUAL WITH AN INCOME OF THIRTEEN FIFTY? AYE AT AGE SIXTY FOUR IS ELIGIBLE FOR FREE MEDI CAL BUT WHEN'S. HERE SHE TURNED SIXTY FIVE NOW HAS ITS SHARE OF COSTS OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS THAT'S OVER HALF THEIR INCOME WHICH HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MENEM'S CLEAR RAMSEY I'M AN ATTORNEY WITH JUSTICE IN AGING AND I REALLY WANNA FOCUS ON TWO ELEMENTS OF THIS BILL. ONE IS THAT IT IS A VERY EFFECTIVE METHOD MECHANISM TO MITIGATE SENIOR POVERTY AND IT WILL CREATE EQUITY BETWEEN SENIORS AND OTHER ADULT MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. AS YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD IN IN OTHER BILLS THERE'S A GROWING NUMBER OF SENIORS IN CALIFORNIA LIVING IN POVERTY. AND ONE OF THE MAIN DRIVERS UP THIS POVERTY INCREASE IS HIGH MEDICAL COSTS. FREE MEDI CAL IS IN ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO CLEAR MEDICAL COSTS AND TO KEEP THEM DOWN FOR SENIORS. AND AS LINDA MENTIONED RIGHT NOW WE'RE TALKING AT SENIORS WHO ARE BETWEEN TWELVE HUNDRED FORTY TWO DOLLARS AND THIRTEEN HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN DOLLARS A MONTH. SO WE KNOW IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BARELY ENOUGH TO PAY FOR RENT AND FOOD AND IF YOU ADD IN THE HIGH MEDICAL COSTS PEOPLE ARE MAKING DRACONIAN CHOICES BETWEEN FOOD. RENT MEDICINE GOING TO DOCTORS AND PAYING COPAYS. I JUST WANNA HIGHLIGHT FOR YOU WHAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW AND THERE'S THREE TIMELY EXAMPLES THAT HAVE COME ON TO MY DESK WITHIN THE LAST WEEK. FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY FROM LA COUNTY AND FROM ALAMEDA COUNTY. WHERE SENIORS WHO RECEIVED A COLA INCREASE FROM THE SOCIAL SECURITY OF ABOUT TWENTY DOLLARS A MONTH? HAVE BASICALLY NOW STARTING APRIL FIRST FLIPPED FROM FREE MEDICAL WHERE THEY COULD ACCESS THEIR IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES AND THEIR ADULT DAY HEALTH PROGRAM AND ALL THE OTHER MEDICAL. ASSISTANTS ARE NOW IN SHARE COST MEDI CAL. AND ALL OF THEM WERE SITTING WITH THE SHOW OF COST OF SOMEWHERE AROUND SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS A MONTH. SO IN MARCH THEY CAN AFFORD THEIR HEALTHCARE AND IN APRIL NOW THEY CAN'T. AND IF AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY GET YOUR VOTE AND HOUSES THIS IS THE BILL THAT WILL BASICALLY ALLOW THE SENIORS TO ACCESS ALL THE BENEFITS THAT THEY REQUIRE TO LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY. AND TO AVOID INSTITUTIONAL PLACEMENTS. SO THANK YOU WE URGE AYE VOTE. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS KURT CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA. WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO CO SPONSOR THIS LEGISLATIN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT. I'VE BEEN OF ANOMALY THAT. WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO CRACK FOR. FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS THAT JUST SEEMS TO GET A LITTLE WORSE EVERY YEAR. AND SO WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO BE ABLE TO. WORK AGAIN ON TRYING TO. GET THIS FIXED WE'D WE DID THINK IT WAS IMPORTANT TO GET YOU. THE GRAPH THAT OUR FRIENDS AT THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET AND POLICY CENTER PUT OUT AND WHILE WE ORDINARILY DON'T PRINT DOES IN COLOR WE THOUGHT IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR YOU TO SEE. SIXTY FOUR ZERO SIXTY FIVE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY DOLLARS AND SHARING COSTS AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE THE BLUNT EDGE OF. THE IMPACT IS THAT THIS BILL FAXES LIKE YOU.

COMMITTEE MEMBERS TODAY I'M PRESENTING ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR WHICH WOULD ENSHRINE THE HEALTH. HEALTH IN ALL POLICIES TASK FORCE INTO A PERMANENT PROGRAM. THE HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES OR. OF THIS GREAT ACRONYM. HI ATOP. OF TASK FORCE WELL IT REALLY. SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING YOU SAY WE GET UP ON A HORSE. HI AT. TO DO THAT ONE BUT. THIS TASK FORCE WITH THIS TABLET'S BY EXECUTIVE ORDER AND TWENTY TEN BY THEN GOVERNOR SCHWARZENEGGER. THE GIVE YEAH BUT I CAN. IT'S THE THIS TASK FORCE WAS THE FIRST OF ITS KIND IN THE NATION AND BRINGS TOGETHER EIGHTEEN STATE AGENCIES DEPARTMENTS AND OFFICES TO IDENTIFY PRIORITY PROGRAMS POLICIES AND STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE. THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS SOMETHING I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE IS IMPORTANT. THE HIGH UP TASK FORCE PLAYS A CRITICAL ROLE IN CONNECTING AGENCIES OF PROMOTING HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS DECISION MAKING WITHIN AGENCIES. ADDED ALSO PLAYS AN IMPORTANT PART PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO AGENCIES. BECAUSE OF THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HIGH APRS ACTUALLY HELPED CREATE PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE OFFICE OF FARM TO FORK. PROGRAMS THAT TO INCREASE HEALTHY TREES AND SCHOOLS THAT PROVIDE NATURAL CANOPY AND HEAT RELIEF ARE IN THOSE SCHOOLS AND HYPE IS HELPED DEVELOP HEALTH INEQUITY TOOLS AND STATE. TRANSPORTATION PLANNING AS WELL. THE TASK FORCE HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD FOR PROMOTING A HEALTHIER CALIFORNIA IN AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR INSURERS THAT IT'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE ITS GOOD WORK. ON A PERMANENT BASIS WITH ME I HAVE KIM CHEN FROM THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH NETWORK SPONSORED THE BILL AND JUDI ROBINSON FROM. AT THE. DESIGNED FOR ACTIVE SACRAMENTO. PARTICULARLY TENANTS THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH OR PROUD O SPONSOR AND SUPPORT AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY FOUR STEVEN HAS BEEN A KEY STAKEHOLDER IN SUPPORT OF HIGH UP SINCE ITS INCEPTION. TO THE GREAT WORK THEY DO TODAY AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SEE THIS WAR CONTINUE WITH. THIS BILL WE KNOW THAT ON ITS OWN ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE IS NOT ONLY ONE PART OF WHAT KEEPS US HEALTHY IN THEIR MANY OTHER FACTORS THAT CAN SUPPORT A BLOCK A PERSON'S ABILITY TO LEAD A HEALTHY LIFE. FROM WHETHER FAMILIES HAVE ACCESS TO FOODS TO. QUALITY OF THE AIR THAT. PEOPLE BREATHE IN THESE FACTORS ARE BROADLY UNDERSTOOD AS SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH. DECISIONS BY POLICY MAKERS AND GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE CONSIDERATIONS FOR SOCIAL DETERMINANTS CAN HAVE A TREMENDOUS IMPACT ON HEALTH OUTCOMES. AND THE HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES TASK FORCES THE APPROACH THAT SYSTEMATICALLY TAKES THIS INTO ACCOUNT AND AS MISTER BLOOM A SPOKE TO THE STATE TOOK A LEADERSHIP ROLE EIGHT YEARS AGO IS IN ESTABLISHING THE HIGH PASSPORTS. AND WITH THIS BILL WILL MAKE SURE THAT THIS WORK CONTINUES IN A PERMANENT MANNER POPPED INTO A PROGRAM WE ARE SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON HONORABLE TWENTY MEMBERS. THANK YOU YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU IN THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION TO KEEP HEALTH AND ALL STATE POLICIES. MY NAME IS JUDY ROBINSON ON A PRINCIPLE PLANNER CHAIR OF DESIGN TRACTOR SACRAMENTO PART OF THE NONPROFIT WALK SACRAMENTO. ACROSS SECTOR HEALTH AND BUILT ENVIRONMENT TEAM WHO'S BEEN WORKING ACROSS THE REGION STATE AND NATION. TO EMBED HEALTH AND POLICIES PRACTICES AND PROJECTS MY COMMENTS TODAY ARE BASED ON EXPERIENCES WITH DESIGN FRACTOR SACRAMENTO AND THE EXPERTISE WE'VE DEVELOPED THAT ADVANCING IMPLEMENT HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES. OUR WORK STARTED BECAUSE HIGH UP AND IS TO SEE INCLUDED HEALTH QUESTIONS IN THIS EARLY SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES AND URBAN GRINNING GRANT PROGRAMS. BY ANSWERING THESE QUESTIONS WE LEARNED THAT THE WAY THAT WE'VE BEEN BUILDING ARE COMMUNITIES HAS EXACERBATED CHRONIC DISEASE. AND SOCIAL ISOLATION MAKING IT HARDER FOR PEOPLE LIVE HEALTHY AND PRODUCTIVE LIVES. WHAT RESULTED WAS A CREATION OF DESIGN TRACTOR SACRAMENTO COMPRISED OF PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS TRANSPORTATION ENGINEERS LAND USE PLANNERS? WHAT SACRAMENTO IN PRIVATE SECTOR PHYSICIANS INCLUDING IN NEUROSURGEON? DESIGNED FOR AFTER SACRAMENTO WORK WAS SACRAMENTO COUNTY TO ADOPT HEALTH POLICIES IN THEIR GENERAL PLAN AND ADDRESS HEALTH THROUGH ACTIVE DESIGN. AFTER DESIGN AND HEALTH WAS ADOPTED INTO THE COUNTY ZONING CODE AND COUNTY WIDE DESIGN GUIDELINES FIRST IN THE COUNTRY TO CODIFY. HEALTH INTO A DEVELOPMENT CODE. IN THE COURSE OF DOING THIS WORK WE ENGAGED WITH STATE HEALTH AND ALL POLICY STAFF TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE COULD SUPPORT EACH OTHER IN THE WORK. AND WHAT HEALTH LOOKS LIKE IN THE GROUND. WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER WITH STATE HIGH UP STAFF FOR YEARS FINDING WAYS OF STATE POLICY CAN BE IMPLEMENTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE HEALTH HAPPENS. IN SPREADING HIGH AB GOALS WE'VE BEEN BRINGING TOGETHER LOCAL GOVERNMENT HEALTH TRANSPORTATION PLANNING ANOTHER SECTORS SHOWING THEM WITH THEIR WORK INTERSEX AND HOW THEY CAN INFLUENCE POSITIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES BY CONSIDERING HEALTH. IN THEIR POLICIES PRACTICES AND PROJECTS WE SUPPORTED HIGH UP STAFF IN EXPANDING HEALTH QUESTIONS INTO GRANT APPLICATIONS AND IN PARTICULAR EXTRA POINTS. AWARD OF THE CALTRANS ACTED TRANSPORTATION SCORING RUBRICS FOR ENGAGING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS. WHEN COMPLETE IN THE GRANT APPLICATION THIS IS CRITICAL BECAUSE ENGINEERS AND PLANNERS WHO ARE WRITING THE GRANTS HAVE LIMITED KNOWLEDGE OF HOW COMMUNITY DESIGN AND HEALTH ARE LINKED. THERE AND AWARE OF ALL THIS HEALTH DATA THAT'S AVAILABLE AND THEY'RE NOT IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR HEALTH COLLEAGUES. THAT CAN HELP THEM CONNECT THE HEALTH DOTS. THE SCOOP S SCORING RUBRICS ARE DRIVING EDUCATION AND CHANGE AND THE BEAUTY OF INVENTING HEALTH AND ALL POLICIES. AND HOW WE BUILD OUR COMMUNITIES IS OF THE HIGHER UP APPROACH IS EQUITABLE PROVIDES FOR QUALITY OF LIFE FOR ALL. AND HELPS COMMUNITIES BE RESILIENT IN OUR CHANGING CLIMATE.

THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AUTHORITY TO ENFORCE FEDERAL FACILITY STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIED LICENSE CLINICS WHICH IS A CHRONIC AYE DIALYSIS SURGICAL AND REHABILITATION AND CERTAIN DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITY ARE I'M SORRY DISABLED NURSING FACILITIES. THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT AUTHORITY LAPSED TIME DURING THAT GENERATE FIRST OF THIS YEAR. AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY SIX SIX EXTEND THE AUTHORITY UNTIL JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY ONE REQUIRING THOSE FACILITIES TO COMPLY WITH SPECIFIED FEDERAL CERTIFICATION STANDARDS. UNTIL REGULATIONS ARE ADOPTED BY THE DEPARTMENT. THE REINSTATEMENT OF THE ABILITY FOR THE STATE TO ENFORCE FEDERAL STANDARDS PROVIDE A FLOOR IN A BEEF TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SIX WILL ENSURE. THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH CAN ENFORCE BASIC STANDARDS OF CARE PROVIDED IN THESE CLINICS AND REHABILITATION NURSING FACILITIESFOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS MOST OF VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE FOR THIS MUCH NEEDED PROPOSAL WITH ME TODAY I HAVE A CRISPY FOR FROM THE CALIFORNIA DIALYSIS COUNCIL.

THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE PERFECTLY. SO THE MOTION IS TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL WOULD I WOULD I MAIENSCHEIN. MAINTAIN AYE ACTOR CURRY. I HEAR CURRY AYE BONTA. BURKE. BURKE I CARILLO. CARILLO AYE FLORA. FLORA AYE LIMON. THE MOMENT I MCCARTY. MCCARTY AYE NAZARIAN. THE SYRIAN AYE RODRIGUEZ RODRIGUEZ AYE SANTIAGO. STEINORTH. BERMAN. BERMAN I'VE WALDRON. IT'S ELEVEN ZERO YOUR BILL WAS I THINK A MEASURE WHICH RUBIO. THIS POINT WILL GO TO MISTER HIS AREA. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I'LL BE ACCEPTING THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH. ENSURE THAT QUALIFIED DISTRIBUTIONS WOULD NOT BE COUNTED AS INCOME. I HAVE ALSO PROPOSED FINDINGS AND DECORATIONS WHICH REINFORCED THE IMPORTANCE OF SAVING FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. A AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WOULD EXCLUDE THE PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST OF A FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS PLAN. FOR AN ASSET OR A RESOURCES TEST TO DETERMINE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY FOR NON MANAGE AYE POPULATION. UNDER CURRENT LAW THIS GROUP WHICH GENERALLY CONSISTS OF LOW INCOME SENIORS THOSE WITH DISABILITIES AND THOSE AND LONG TERM CARE. REMAIN SUBJECT TO PROPERTY AND INCOME TESTS IN ORDER TO QUALIFY FOR MEDICAL SERVICES. IT'S A GREAT BILL I LIKE IT I HOPE YOU ALL LIKE IT. AND WITH ME AS JAN FLOREY FROM THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. AND SABRINA HAM FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION. JEFF ARE YOU SIR GEN FLORA THE WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY. WHERE THE OLDEST AND LARGEST LEGAL SERVICES SUPPORT CENTER IN THE STATE AND OUR HEALTH TEAM FOCUSES PRIMARILY ON MEDI CAL WE ALSO WORK WITH THE HEALTH CONSUMER ALLIANCES SERVES ALL OF THAT CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CONSUMERS? IN TWENTY FOURTEEN WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT CALIFORNIA SPLIT ITS POPULATION IT TO TO INCOME COUNTING METHODOLOGIES THE FIRST ONE THE MODIFIED ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME. METHODOLOGY IS BASED ON ADJUSTED GROSS INCOME WHICH COMES FROM TAX FILINGS. SO FOR THAT METHODOLOGY THAT APPLIES TO PARENTS CHILDREN AND THE EXPANSION ADULTS WHICH WERE ADULTS THAT FORMERLY HAD NO LINKAGE TO THE MEDICARE PROGRAM. THE ADDITIONAL POPULATION WHICH IS THE SAME POPULATION WE JUST SPOKE ABOUT WITH AB TWENTY FOUR THIRTY. IS NON MATCH I. THOSE ARE ADULTS OVER AGE SIXTY FIVE PEOPLE IN LINKED PROGRAMS SOME PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES WHO ARE INELIGIBLE FOR THE ADULT EXPANSION GROUP BECAUSE THEY'RE ELIGIBLE FOR MEDICARE. AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER SPECIAL POPULATIONS. SO WHETHER A FIVE TWENTY NINE PLANET CAN'T PLAN COUNTS AGAINST US A MEDICO APPLICANT DEPENDS ON WHETHER YOU'RE IN MATCH I MEDI CAL OR NON. ACCOUNT. IN MATCH I MEDI CAL WE DON'T HAVE IN ASSETS TEST ANYMORE IN NON MATCH I MEDI CAL WE DO SO CURRENTLY IT'S YOU KNOW QUESTIONABLE WHETHER IT THAT FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN WOULD COUNT AGAINST YOU. AND THEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE PROPOSED INCOME SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE QUALIFY DISTRIBUTIONS WHEN YOU GO TO USE YOUR FIVE TWENTY NINE PLAN TO ACCESS EDUCATION. IF YOU'RE IN MATCH I MEDI CAL. THIS IS NOT TAXABLE INCOME SO IT DOESN'T COUNT AGAINST YOU IF YOU'RE NOT MATCH I MEDI CAL AGAIN IT CAN COUNT AGAINST YOU AS INCOME. SO AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE IS REALLY JUST ENSURING THAT ALL MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS CAN USE FIVE TWENTY NINE. PLANS TO THE SAME EXTENT MEDI CAL RECIPIENTS SHOULD NOT BE DISCOURAGED FROM SAVING FROM PLANNING FOR THE FUTURE OR FROM USING A DEDICATED EDUCATIONAL FUND. FOR EDUCATIONAL EXPENSES I'D LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THE HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS CLEARLY IN ON THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT THERE WERE SOME IN INTENDED CONSEQUENCES. AND WE THINK THIS IS A GOOD START TO START LOOKING AT THE ASSETS AGAIN. STARTING WITH A TAX ADVANTAGE PLAN THAT ON ONE HAND THE GOVERNMENT IS ENCOURAGING AND THE ON THE OTHER HAND IS PENALIZING SOME PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING THEIR HEALTHCARE BENEFITS. THANK YOU. HI GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU I CHAIRPERSON AND ASSEMBLYMEMBER'S FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS SABRINA HAMMER I'M WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSET BUILDING COALITION. WE ARE. A LOW WE REPRESENT OVER TWO HUNDRED ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS CALIFORNIA THAT ARE COMMITTED TO HELPING LOW INCOME FAMILIES BECOME MORE FINANCIALLY STABLE. AND WE ARE STRONG SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WE RECOGNIZE THAT PUBLIC BENEFITS AND ABILITY TO SAVE SHOULD WORK IN TANDEM TO SUPPORT ECONOMIC MOBILITY. AND FINANCIAL SECURITY FOR LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS. CURLY UNDERSTANDS BY DENYING ACCOUNTS ARE CONSIDERED FOR MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY FOR NON MATCH I. THIS LEAVES LOW INCOME FAMILIES IN A TOUGH SPOT THEY MUST CHOOSE BETWEEN SAVING FOR COLLEGE AND STAYING ELIGIBLE FOR AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE. IT'S APPARENT THAT ASSET LIMITS PRESENTS A SERIOUS BARRIER. TO SAVINGS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES WHO RELY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. CALIFORNIA DEMONSTRATED THEIR COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING FAMILIES TO SAVE FOR COLLEGE OR THE INTRODUCED SCHOLAR SHARE A STATE RUN FIVE TWENTY NINE COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT MANY DECADES AGO. SINCE THEN SCHOLARSHIP HAS WORKED TO HELP OVER. TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS OPEN SAFE AND AFFORDABLE COLLEGE SAVINGS CAPS. JUST THIS YEAR SCOTT WILSHIRE INTRODUCED A. A MATCHING GRANT PROGRAM FOR FAMILIES EARNING LESS THAN SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR. THIS PROGRAM WILL MATCH SAVINGS CONTRIBUTIONS FOR UP TO TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS. WHICH MAY NOT SEEM LIKE A LOT BEFORE LOW INCOME FAMILIES THIS IS A. HUGE STEP FOR THEM. CB SI IS A PROUD PARTNER OF SCHOLARSHIP BECAUSE WE UNDERSTAND THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT AND SAVING FOR THE FUTURE. WE UNDERSTAND THAT STUDENTS WITH AT LEAST FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN COLLEGE SAVINGS IS THREE TIMES MORE LIKELY TO ENROLL HIGHER EDUCATION. AND FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE THAN THOSE WITHOUT A COLLEGE SAVINGS ACCOUNT. AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY FIVE AS A NECESSARY STEP IN REMOVING BEARS. TO COLLEGE SAVINGS FOR LOW INCOME FAMILIES PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS WHO OPEN UP TWENTY FIVE TWENTY NINE. SAVING ACCOUNTS FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN ALSO UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE AND COLLEGE SAVINGS AND THEY SHOULD NOT BE PIN PENALIZED. FOR HELPING THEIR LOVED ONES AFFORD. THE COST OF HIGHER EDUCATION FURTHER RESEARCH HAS SHOWN THAT THE COST OF ATTENDING HIGHER EDUCATION IS A HUGE FACTOR RETENTION RATES AMONG LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WE MUST REMOVE BARRIERS THAT KEEP LOW INCOME FAMILIES FROM SAVING FOR THE FUTURE STATE TO KATHY CLOCK EQUAL OPPORTUNITY FOR AN ECONOMIC MOBILITY AND THE CHANCE TO FOR THE COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE. I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER DESIGN FOR HIS LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR TYPE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHERS TO SUPPORT. OH WEST SAM'S IF UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND STRONG SUPPORT. NO I BOTTOM WITH CALIFORNIA RURAL LEGAL ASSISTANCE FOUNDATION IN SUPPORT. KELLY PARTS OF THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION. THE ONE IN OPPOSITION. NO ONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO. MOTIONS. DO NOT HAVE A MUCH SOME OF WE DO NOW. WHAT THE SECOND WAS? THE TIGER THE MOTION. FRED MATHIS REYES RODRIGUEZ SO. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS ANYONE. SAID MISTER YET IS THAT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF DEBATE ABOUT FIVE TWENTY NINE ACCOUNTS NEVER IN THE HEALTH COMMITTEE. NORMALLY IN THE HIGHER ADDER. AND TAXATION BUT. WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE PEOPLE TO SAVE IN GENERAL AND SAVE FOR COLLEGE IS IS SO KEY INTO. WE DON'T WANT TO HURT PEOPLE'S ON. MEDICAL OPPORTUNITIES IN MEDICAL COVERAGE BY MAKING FOR HAVING THEM INVEST IN THEIR IN THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS COLLEGE. PLANNED SO THIS IS A SMART EFFORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. SEEING NO ONE WILL. WE HAVE A MOTION BY MISTER MCCARTY A SECOND BY MISTER RODRIGUEZ THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MR MAIENSCHEIN. PRESENTING THE FINAL TO LOOK THE DAY. AB TWO ZERO ONE A. THANK YOU I. I RECOGNIZE THE CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF BEFORE I BEGIN I'LL BE ACCEPTING AMENDMENTS DESCRIBED IN THE ANALYSIS TO ALLOW ALL CURRENT HEALTHCARE PRACTITIONERS ELIGIBLE. FOR THE STEVEN M. THOMPSON POSITION CORPS LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM TO APPLY FOR EARLY LOAN REPAYMENTS INSTEAD OF PROVIDING EARLY LONGER PAYMENTS ONLY. TO PSYCHIATRIC TRAINEES. THE SHORTAGE OF PSYCHIATRISTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAS REACHED CRISIS LEVELS AND CALIFORNIA SUFFERING THE FALLOUT. THE NATIONAL COUNCIL FOR BEHOLD BEHAVE ORIEL HEALTH IN ITS TWENTY SEVENTEEN REPORT PROJECTED THE DEMAND FOR PSYCHIATRY WHICH OUTSTRIP SERVICES BY TWENTY FIVE PERCENT IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AS IT NOW STANDS FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF COUNTIES IN THE U. S. HAVE NO PSYCHIATRISTS AND SEVENTY SEVEN PERCENT HAVE A SEVERE SHORTAGE. THE SHORTAGES CREATED CRITICAL WEAKNESSES IN OUR PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT COUNTIES ARE STRUGGLING TO PATCH BY EXPANDING THE ROLES OF OTHER CATEGORIES OF WORKERS. SUCH AS PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND PEER PROVIDERS HOWEVER A LASTING SOLUTION REQUIRES A MORE SUBSTANTIVE FIX THAT REVITALIZES THE FIELD. AND MUST INCLUDE A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO STEER PROMISING STUDENTS INTO CAREERS AND COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRY ENSURING OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO QUALITY PSYCHIATRIC CARE. AB TWENTY EIGHTEEN ADDRESSES THE SHORTAGE BY TACKLING THE HEAVY BURDEN OF DEBT SO MANY STUDENTS SHOULDER AS A PURSUE AN ADVANCED MEDICAL DEGREE. IT IS NOT UNUSUAL IN CALIFORNIA TO FIND PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS IN TRAINING WITH DEBT LOADS THAT EXCEED TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. FOR DECADES GOVERNMENTS HAVE USED LOAN REPAYMENT AND LOAN FORGIVENESS PROGRAMS TO FUEL INTEREST IN HARD TO FILL PRACTICE SECTORS DEEMED VITAL TO THE PUBLIC INTEREST. AB TWENTY EIGHTEEN MORE EXPANSIVE PROGRAMS FOR PSYCHIATRIC RESIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA WHO COMMIT TO WORKING IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF AB TWENTY EIGHTEEN OUR DOCTOR PRETTY A FELLOW WHEN YOU SEE ES DE PROGRAM AND DOCTOR CUNNINGHAM A RECENT GRADUATE OF YOU SEE. CISCO PROGRAM ADRIN SHELTON WITH THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE AND RANDALL HAGER WITH THE CALIFORNIA PSYCHIATRIC ASSESS ASSOCIATION ARE ALSO BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS. THE PRE SCRATCH. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. MY NAME SPREE THE OSHA I AM A FELLOW AT UC SAN DIEGO'S COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRY PROGRAM AND I'LL BE GRADUATING THIS JUNE. I HAVE HAD THE UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO ROTATE AT A NUMBER OF SITES OUTSIDE OF THE TRADITIONAL ACADEMIC MEDICAL CENTER ALL OVER SAN DIEGO COUNTY. SOME OF THOSE INCLUDE THE SURVIVORS OF TORTURE INTERNATIONAL WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT TAKES CARE OF FOLKS WHO ARE HERE SEEKING ASYLUM AFTER HAVING BEEN TORTURED IN THEIR HOME COUNTRIES. I ALSO WORK WITH SAN DIEGO YOU'D SERVICES WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION THAT SUPPORTS WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF TWELVE AND TWENTY FOUR WHO ARE SURVIVORS OF SEX TRAFFICKING. I AM THE PSYCHIATRIST TO THE DEAF COMMUNITY SERVICES OF SAN DIEGO AS WELL AS ONE OF THE DOCKS AT ARE COUNTIES URGENT MENTAL HEALTH WALK IN CLINIC. THE FIFTH SITE THAT A ROTATE OUT. THIS YEAR IS A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER JUST NORTH OF THE MEXICAN BORDER WHERE I WORK WITH PREDOMINANTLY A HISPANIC POPULATION. SO WITH THIS OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH SO MANY DIFFERENT GROUPS OF PEOPLE I HAVE A VERY CLEAR IDEA OF THE DAY DEFICIT THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH STATEWIDE IN TERMS OF HOW HARD IT IS TO GET IN TO SEE A PSYCHIATRIST. THE WAIT TIME TO SEE ME AS AT LEAST ONE TO TWO MONTHS AT MOST OF THESE CLINICAL SITES AND OFTENTIMES. EVEN MORE THAN I. AB A STUDY THAT JUST CAME OUT OF YOU SEE A STUFF A FEW MONTHS AGO SUGGEST THAT OF THOSE PSYCHIATRISTS THAT ARE PRACTICING IN CALIFORNIA ONLY FORTY SIX PERCENT SEE PEOPLE WHO HAVE MEDI CAL COVERAGE. AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE FROM THE SITES THAT I SHARED WITH YOU MOST OF THE PATIENTS THAT I SEE. HAVE MEDI CAL OR OR ARE UNFUNDED. AND THE PROBLEMS ONLY GOING TO GET WORSE. THAT SEEMS STUDIES SUGGEST THAT IN TEN YEARS WE WILL HAVE A FORTY TO FIFTY PERCENT OF THE STATE AND THE PSYCHIATRIST THAT WE NEED. SO THEN THE CONUNDRUM THAT THAT I AND MANY OTHER RESIDENTS FACE IS WHAT DO WE DO WHEN IT COMES TIME TO FINDING OUR FIRST REAL JOB. ALL GRADUATE THIS JUNE WITH A COMMITMENT TO CONTINUING TO SERVE THE COMMUNITY POPULATION WHICH I HAVE. SO MUCH ENJOYED OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS THE REALITY IS THOUGH THAT WHEN I GRADUATE I WILL ALSO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT LOAN BURDEN. ACCORDING TO BE A. M. C. THERE IS THAT AN AVERAGE MEDICAL STUDENT GRADUATION FEE OF TWO OF NEARLY TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. OFTENTIMES IT'S EVEN HIGHER THAN THAT. SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE. COST BENEFIT ANALYSIS OF THE NEED THAT WE KNOW WE NEED TO GET FOLKS TO GO INTO COMMUNITY PSYCHIATRY. BUT WE STILL NEED TO CONSIDER WHAT'S HOLDING THEM BACK. BY PROMOTING SOME TYPE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL EXPAND THE OPPORTUNITY FOR LOAN REPAYMENT WE HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF RESIDENTS WHO LIKE ME WANT TO SERVE IN THIS COMMUNITY BUT CAN DO SO WITH A BIT MORE PEACE OF MIND. SO STRONGLY URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION SO WE CAN CONTINUE TO GIVE HIGH QUALITY PSYCHIATRIC CARE TO THE PATIENTS WHO DESERVE. THANK YOU. VERY MUCH. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US MY NAME IS CARRIE CUNNINGHAM AND I AM AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF PSYCHIATRY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA SAN FRANCISCO. IMPORTANT FAMILY AND COMMUNITY MEDICINE AND PSYCHIATRY WHICH MEANS THAT I HAVE HAD SEVEN YEARS OF TRAINING AFTER MEDICAL SCHOOL ALL THE WHILE ACCRUING STUDENT LOAN INTEREST. AM I SPEAKING STAYS A RECENT GRADUATE OF THE UCSF PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP. I'LL ALSO BE THE INCOMING MEDICAL DIRECTOR AND A COMMUNITY MENTAL HEALTH CENTER. WORK AND MISSION IS TO SUPPORT THE RECOVERY OF SAN FRANCISCO'S HIGHEST REST MENTALLY ILL ADULTS. I'LL BE STARTING THIS POSITION ONLY ONE OUT OF TRAINING WHICH I BELIEVE IS A DIRECT RESULT OF THEIR TREE TRAINING I RECEIVED AS A PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY FOLLOW. IN FACT THE DIRECTOR OF OUR CLINIC IS ALSO A GRADUATE OF THE SAME PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY FELLOWSHIP PROGRAM.

PEOPLE OFTEN HAVE HISTORIES OF INCARCERATION AND HIGH UTILIZATION OF HEALTH CARE SYSTEMS. THIS WOULD LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAM IS CRUCIAL IN ALLOWING RESIDENTS TO CONTINUE TRAINING IN PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY AND SUPPORT FOLLOWS IN CHOOSING TO WORK IN PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEMS. I KNOW ALL TOO WELL THAT PURSUING THIS TRAINING ALSO OFTEN MEANS OCCURRING GREATER STUDENT LOAN THAT. BUT APPARENTLY THIS TRAINING PREPARES US TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE MOST COMPLEX AND VULNERABLE PATIENTS IN OUR SYSTEM. ONE OF THE MANY STORIES ILLUSTRATE THE VALUE PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY THAT I CAN THINK OF IS A YOUNG WOMAN I WORKED WITH THIS YEAR WHO HAS A DIAGNOSIS OF SCHIZOPHRENIA AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER. SHE IS LIVING ENTITLED CAN'T MEANT SLEEPING ONLY ON A MATTRESS OUTSIDE AND WAS FREQUENTLY HOSPITALIZED THE ISSUE IS WELL KNOWN TO PROVIDERS OUR SYSTEM SHE OFTEN DECLINE TREATMENT. UTILIZING THE KNOWLEDGE OF SKILLS ARE DEVELOPED AS A PUBLIC PSYCHIATRY FELLOW OUR TEAM WORKS I WITH HER TOWARDS SCHOOLS OF HOUSING SUPPORTED EMPLOYMENT. AND COORDINATION WITH COMMUNITY SERVICES. CLINICALLY I ALSO LEARNED TO MEET PATIENTS WHERE THEY'RE AT WHICH MAN AT ONE POINT KNOCKING ON THREE DIFFERENT WHITE VANS IN THE TUNDRA LINE TO TRY TO FIND HER TARA REACHED HER. SHE'S NOW SAFELY HOUSED REGULARLY ATTENDING MENTAL HEALTH AND PRIMARY CARE VISITS AND ABOUT TO START EMPLOYMENT PROGRAM.
