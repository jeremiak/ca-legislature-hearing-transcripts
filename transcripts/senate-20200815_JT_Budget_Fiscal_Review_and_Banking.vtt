00:22:11.897 --> 00:22:14.466
LEGISLATION HAS. BEEN AMENDED

00:22:14.533 --> 00:22:16.768
IT VERY SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE

00:22:16.835 --> 00:22:18.336
ORIGINAL PROPOSED VERSION.

00:22:18.403 --> 00:22:19.905
HOWEVER THE MINISTRATION HAS

00:22:19.971 --> 00:22:21.840
NOT PROVIDED AN UPDATED

00:22:21.907 --> 00:22:23.709
ESTIMATE OF THE FUNDING NEEDED.

00:22:23.775 --> 00:22:25.043
TIME TO IMPLEMENT THE PROGRAM

00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:27.145
THAT WOULD ALIGN WITH THE-

00:22:27.212 --> 00:22:28.580
ACTUAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

00:22:28.647 --> 00:22:30.215
THAT'S BEING PUT FORWARD-

00:22:30.282 --> 00:22:32.551
TODAY. AND SO WE THINK THAT THE

00:22:32.617 --> 00:22:34.152
LEGISLATURE WILL WANT TO

00:22:34.219 --> 00:22:35.487
CONSIDER THREE STOPS WHEN

00:22:35.554 --> 00:22:36.688
DETERMINING THE FUNDING IT

00:22:36.755 --> 00:22:38.623
PROVIDES. IF THERE IS AN

00:22:38.690 --> 00:22:41.326
AGREEMENT REACHED ON THE

00:22:41.393 --> 00:22:42.828
TRAILER LEGISLATION. THE FIRST

00:22:42.894 --> 00:22:44.296
I'M IS SCALING THE FUNDING TO

00:22:44.362 --> 00:22:46.264
THE FINAL TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE

00:22:46.331 --> 00:22:48.567
AND THEY JUST SAID THAT-

00:22:48.633 --> 00:22:50.202
PROPOSED FINDING AND THAT THE

00:22:50.268 --> 00:22:51.503
TIME ADMINISTRATION BELIEVED TO

00:22:51.570 --> 00:22:52.637
BE NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:22:52.704 --> 00:22:55.407
LANGUAGE. HASN'T BEEN REALIGNED

00:22:55.474 --> 00:22:58.410
THE NEW VERSION OF THE LANGUAGE

00:22:58.477 --> 00:22:59.010
AND THERE COULD BE ADDITIONAL

00:22:59.077 --> 00:22:59.611
CHANGES THAT THE LEGISLATURE

00:22:59.678 --> 00:23:00.479
WOULD LIKE TO SEE IN THE

00:23:00.545 --> 00:23:01.847
LANGUAGE I'M BEFORE A FINAL

00:23:01.913 --> 00:23:03.982
AGREEMENT IS REACHED. AND SO

00:23:04.049 --> 00:23:05.083
THE FINAL LANGUAGE WE THINK

00:23:05.150 --> 00:23:06.618
SHOULD JUST SCALE AND ALIGN

00:23:06.685 --> 00:23:08.386
WITH WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE

00:23:08.453 --> 00:23:11.423
AGREED UPON TIME TRAILER

00:23:11.490 --> 00:23:13.792
LEGISLATION. SECOND WE THINK IT

00:23:13.859 --> 00:23:15.460
WOULD BE WISE TO NOT COMMIT TO

00:23:15.527 --> 00:23:17.462
FUTURE FUNDING INCREASES. AT

00:23:17.529 --> 00:23:20.031
THIS TIME- ASISTIR NOTED IN

00:23:20.098 --> 00:23:21.600
YOUR STOPPAGE AND THAT THERE'S

00:23:21.666 --> 00:23:23.535
I'M OUT YOUR INCREASES TO THE

00:23:23.602 --> 00:23:25.537
LEVEL OF FUNDING. IN THE

00:23:25.604 --> 00:23:28.140
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL THIS

00:23:28.206 --> 00:23:30.008
ONE'S ACTUALLY BEEN SET ASIDE

00:23:30.075 --> 00:23:32.110
AND AS PART OF THE TWENTY

00:23:32.177 --> 00:23:33.278
TWENTY ONE BUDGET PAN. AND ARE

00:23:33.345 --> 00:23:34.913
RESPONSIBLE TO THE MINISTRATION

00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:36.481
THROUGH EIGHT- JOINT

00:23:36.548 --> 00:23:38.216
LEGISLATIVE BUDGET COMMITTEE

00:23:38.283 --> 00:23:39.951
PROCESS- IN ORDER TO ACCESS

00:23:40.018 --> 00:23:42.387
THOSE FINES. AND THAT BUT WE

00:23:42.454 --> 00:23:43.855
THINK THAT NOT COMMITTING TO

00:23:43.922 --> 00:23:45.690
THE FUTURE OUT YOUR INCREASES

00:23:45.757 --> 00:23:46.191
OF THOSE TIMES WOULD BE

00:23:46.258 --> 00:23:48.727
PRUDENT. HI I'M THIS IS BECAUSE

00:23:48.794 --> 00:23:49.895
THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY

00:23:49.961 --> 00:23:51.263
AROUND WITH THOSE OUT YOUR

00:23:51.329 --> 00:23:53.565
COSTS WILL ACTUALLY BE. I'M FOR

00:23:53.632 --> 00:23:54.699
EXAMPLE THERE ADMINISTRATION

00:23:54.766 --> 00:23:56.568
ESTIMATES IT WILL COVER ABOUT

00:23:56.635 --> 00:23:57.202
NINE THOUSAND NEW COVERED

00:23:57.269 --> 00:23:58.703
PERSONS OFFER FINANCIAL

00:23:58.770 --> 00:24:00.672
PRODUCTS OR SERVICES- BUT

00:24:00.739 --> 00:24:02.707
BECAUSE THIS PROPOSAL REGULATE

00:24:02.774 --> 00:24:04.676
I CURRENTLY I'M REGULATED

00:24:04.743 --> 00:24:06.444
COMMUNITY. THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF

00:24:06.511 --> 00:24:08.013
COVERED PERSONS AND COULD

00:24:08.079 --> 00:24:10.615
DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. I'M AND

00:24:10.682 --> 00:24:11.917
SECOND HAS NOTED. THE

00:24:11.983 --> 00:24:13.151
ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL

00:24:13.218 --> 00:24:14.586
DIFFERS A LOT OF THE DETAILS OF

00:24:14.653 --> 00:24:16.054
HOW THE PROGRAM SHOULD ACTUALLY

00:24:16.121 --> 00:24:17.022
BE IMPLEMENTED. TO THE

00:24:17.088 --> 00:24:19.357
REGULATORY PROCESS AND THE

00:24:19.424 --> 00:24:20.492
WORKLOAD THAT WOULD ACTUALLY BE

00:24:20.559 --> 00:24:21.960
ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING

00:24:22.027 --> 00:24:22.894
THESE NEW PROGRAMS AND

00:24:22.961 --> 00:24:24.830
RESPONSIBILITIES WON'T BE KNOWN

00:24:24.896 --> 00:24:26.398
UNTIL THOSE REGULATIONS HAVE

00:24:26.464 --> 00:24:28.433
BEEN DEVELOPED. AND THREE

00:24:28.500 --> 00:24:35.574
DIFFERING ANY DECISIONS ON HOW.

00:24:35.640 --> 00:24:36.107
YOUR WORKLOAD I'M WOULD BE

00:24:36.174 --> 00:24:36.875
PRUDENT. I AND THEN LAST YOU

00:24:36.942 --> 00:24:37.676
MAY WANT TO CAN IN WITH PENDING

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:40.212
LET IN PARTICULAR NINE OH EIGHT

00:24:40.278 --> 00:24:41.947
BY. RIGHT HOUSE SKI WEIGHED AND

00:24:42.013 --> 00:24:43.515
SIGNIFICANTLY OVERLAP WITH THIS

00:24:43.582 --> 00:24:45.150
PROPOSAL. AND THAT BILL

00:24:45.217 --> 00:24:47.452
REQUIRES A LICENSURE PROGRAM

00:24:47.519 --> 00:24:49.521
FOR DEBT COLLECTORS WHERE ADDS

00:24:49.588 --> 00:24:51.523
THE TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:53.291
REQUIRES A REGISTRATION PROGRAM

00:24:53.358 --> 00:24:55.227
FOR DEBT COLLECTORS. I HAVE A

00:24:55.293 --> 00:24:56.061
WE SHOULD BE TWO DIFFERENT

00:24:56.127 --> 00:24:57.662
PROGRAMS AS SORT OF A LICENSURE

00:24:57.729 --> 00:25:00.332
PROGRAM BEING- A MORE ROBUST

00:25:00.398 --> 00:25:02.234
REGULATORY PROGRAM AND SO IT

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:03.768
MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE TO PROVIDE

00:25:03.835 --> 00:25:07.038
FUNDING. AND DVO OR THE NEW

THE LEGISLATURE IS ALSO GOING

00:25:13.111 --> 00:25:14.613
TO PASS LEGISLATION THAT WOULD

00:25:14.679 --> 00:25:15.981
CHANGE THAT INTO A FULL

00:25:16.047 --> 00:25:18.884
LICENSURE PROGRAM- AND WE WOULD

00:25:18.950 --> 00:25:19.451

00:25:19.517 --> 00:25:20.752

RESTRUCTURING THINGS OF THAT

00:40:56.287 --> 00:40:58.923
NATURE- THERE ARE ALSO OF

00:40:58.989 --> 00:40:59.590

OF SECURITY AN ALLEGATION AND

00:41:19.143 --> 00:41:20.477
AN ALL ALL THINGS OF THAT

00:41:20.544 --> 00:41:24.248
NATURE BUT THE UPSHOT IS THAT.

00:41:24.315 --> 00:41:24.915
LEAVE THE INCREASING INCOME

00:41:24.982 --> 00:41:26.617
HAVE BEEN ALL OVER THE PLACE

00:41:26.684 --> 00:41:29.253
THERE'S THERE HASN'T BEEN-

00:41:29.320 --> 00:41:31.322
GREAT AMOUNT OF RHYME OR REASON

00:41:31.388 --> 00:41:33.524
TO THEM- EXCEPT TO SAY THAT

00:41:33.591 --> 00:41:35.426
THAT THE VOLUME OF COMPLAINTS

00:41:35.492 --> 00:41:37.061
HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER TIME.

00:41:37.127 --> 00:41:38.262
WELL I MEAN SECURITY SOME OF

00:41:38.329 --> 00:41:40.164
THAT'S SEC ON THE FEDERAL LEVEL

00:41:40.231 --> 00:41:41.765
I REALIZE THE STATE HAS

00:41:41.832 --> 00:41:43.267
POTENTIALLY SOME REAL I'M

00:41:43.334 --> 00:41:44.668
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE-

00:41:44.735 --> 00:41:46.103
WHAT THE RATIONALE AND THE

00:41:46.170 --> 00:41:47.838
REASON FOR THIS IS AND THAT'S

00:41:47.905 --> 00:41:49.440
WHY I GUESS MY QUESTION ABOUT

00:41:49.506 --> 00:41:51.175
THE 40% INCREASE IN COMPLAINTS.

00:41:51.242 --> 00:41:52.843
WELL LET ME TRY TO DRILL DOWN A

00:41:52.910 --> 00:41:54.044
LITTLE BIT MORE HAVE ANY OF THE

00:41:54.111 --> 00:41:56.080
ISSUES. HAVE THERE BEEN ANY

00:41:56.146 --> 00:41:58.048

CURRENT LICENSEES THE DPO.

00:42:01.318 --> 00:42:04.088
CANNOT AND HAS NOT. BEEN

00:42:04.154 --> 00:42:04.688
HANDLING IN THE NORMAL COURSE

00:42:04.755 --> 00:42:11.528
OF BUSINESS. HERE. THIS THIS

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.230
THIS GETS INTO- POTENTIALLY

00:42:13.297 --> 00:42:14.465
CONVERSATIONS AROUND

00:42:14.531 --> 00:42:17.334
ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY- WHAT I

00:42:17.401 --> 00:42:21.672
CAN SAY BROADLY IS THAT. THERE

00:42:21.739 --> 00:42:24.241
HAVEN'T BEEN- I WOULD SAY THERE

00:42:24.308 --> 00:42:26.076
HAVEN'T BEEN MARKET CONCERNS

HAPPENING AT THE CURRENTLY

00:42:29.113 --> 00:42:30.814
LICENSE EVEN THIS LICENSE TO

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:34.551
LEVELS- I THINK THE BROADER

00:42:34.618 --> 00:42:38.389
CONCERN IS WHAT TO DO ABOUT-THOSE THOSE AREAS THAT WE

00:42:38.455 --> 00:42:40.724
CURRENTLY ARE UNABLE TO TOUCH.

00:42:40.791 --> 00:42:41.759
WELL THAT'S THAT LEADS TO MY

00:42:41.825 --> 00:42:43.327
NEXT QUESTION THEN WHY NOT JUST

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:45.229
FOCUS ON THE CURRENTLY

00:42:45.296 --> 00:42:47.164
UNLICENSED OR UNREGISTERED

00:42:47.231 --> 00:42:49.566
ENTITIES OF. PERHAPS THAT WOULD

00:42:49.633 --> 00:42:52.569
SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE SIZE

00:42:52.636 --> 00:42:54.071
OF THE BUDGET REQUEST IN THE-

00:42:54.138 --> 00:42:56.206
SIZE OF THE GOVERNMENT. AGENCY

00:42:56.273 --> 00:42:57.741
THAT'S BEING PROPOSED WOULD

00:42:57.808 --> 00:42:59.743
REORGANIZE AGENCY THAT'S BEING

00:42:59.810 --> 00:43:03.514
PROPOSED. THANK YOU SENATOR I

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.650

00:43:06.717 --> 00:43:09.086
SORTS OF INCREMENTAL CHANGES TO

00:43:09.153 --> 00:43:11.922
THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE.

00:43:11.989 --> 00:43:13.257
PROBABLY DO NOT MARKEDLY CHANGE

00:43:13.324 --> 00:43:14.692
THE RESOURCE REQUEST- CURRENTLY

00:43:14.758 --> 00:43:17.661
PENDING- BUT IT DEFINITELY I

00:43:17.728 --> 00:43:19.630
THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT. TO

00:43:19.697 --> 00:43:21.498
RECOGNIZE THAT PART OF WHAT THE

00:43:21.565 --> 00:43:24.635

MORE LEVEL PLAYING FIELD WHICH

00:43:26.070 --> 00:43:28.539

CONSUMERS AS AS WELL AS THE

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:32.876
MARKET PLACE- THE OBJECTIVE IS

00:43:32.943 --> 00:43:35.612

WHAT I WOULD CALL IT AT THIS

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.604
POINT. THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:55:41.671 --> 00:55:43.206
REGULATE QUOTE ANY COVERED

WORD YOU WERE THINKING ABOUT.

00:55:53.550 --> 00:55:54.784
THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT YOU'VE

00:55:54.851 --> 00:55:56.052
DECIDED AND YOU HAVE A PLAN

00:55:56.119 --> 00:55:58.121

ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY WHAT IS

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:05.128
THE ENFORCEMENT AUTHORITY IS A

00:56:05.195 --> 00:56:06.463
STATUTE GOING TO BE THE

00:56:06.529 --> 00:56:08.098
CITATION OF AUTHORITY WHEN

00:56:11.034 --> 00:56:15.271
GOING TO BE A VERY WEAK. BASIS

AND I READ READ THIS AS PURPOSE

00:56:18.174 --> 00:56:20.944
SIMPLY PURPOSEFULLY TRYING TO

00:56:21.010 --> 00:56:23.580
EXEMPT THE AGENCY. FROM THE

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT

00:56:25.415 --> 00:56:27.817
SO YOU CAN RUN AND FUNCTION ON

00:56:27.884 --> 00:56:29.719
UNDERGROUND REGULATION TO DO

FACT OUR BODIES OF LAW HERE.

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:43.399
AND YOU HAVE NOT GIVEN US ANY

00:56:43.466 --> 00:56:46.002
REAL EVIDENCE OF SOMETHING THAT

00:56:46.069 --> 00:56:48.571
IS SO BROKEN. THAT REQUIRES

00:56:48.638 --> 00:56:51.741
SUCH A DRASTIC GROWTH OF A NEW

00:56:51.808 --> 00:56:54.878
AGENCY. N. AS I ASSESS THE

00:56:54.944 --> 00:56:56.880
NUMBERS HERE WE'RE OVER A

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:57.480
HUNDRED P. WISE JUST TO START

00:56:57.547 --> 00:57:03.119
THIS. SHIPPED IN THE CHANNEL.

00:57:03.186 --> 00:57:04.454
AND WE DO NOT HAVE ANY

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:08.258
INDICATION OF GREGIS VIOLATIONS.

00:57:08.324 --> 00:57:12.996
THAT THIS IS SUPPOSED TO FIX.

00:57:13.062 --> 00:57:15.265
AND WHATNOT DIGIT QUOTE

00:57:15.331 --> 00:57:17.267
MILESTONES NEED TO BE CODIFIED.

00:57:17.333 --> 00:57:19.936
SO WE THE LEGISLATURE KNOW

00:57:20.003 --> 00:57:24.207
EXACTLY WHAT YOUR PLANT IS.

00:57:24.274 --> 00:57:26.843
SUFFICE TO SAY THE- PRACTICING

00:57:26.910 --> 00:57:31.080
REMARKS ARE JUST. A SCATTERING

00:57:31.147 --> 00:57:33.316
OF CONCERNS. BUT THERE ARE

00:57:33.383 --> 00:57:35.285
SERIOUS SERIOUS CONCERNS

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.620
COMMISSIONER ALVAREZ. CAN YOU

00:57:37.687 --> 00:57:39.289
PUT ME AT EASE ABOUT ANY OF

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:42.759
THESE OBSERVATIONS. THAT I OR

00:57:42.826 --> 00:57:45.428
MY COLLEAGUES HAVE MADE.

00:57:45.495 --> 00:57:49.299
SENATOR. WHAT I WOULD SAY IS

00:57:49.365 --> 00:57:52.569
RISK. WE NOW WITH THAT

00:57:52.635 --> 00:57:56.039
ECONOMIC- DOWNTURNS AND

00:57:56.105 --> 00:58:01.411
DISLOCATIONS LEAD TO BAD

00:58:01.477 --> 00:58:02.779
BEHAVIOR IN THE IN THE CONSUMER

00:58:02.846 --> 00:58:07.383
FINANCIAL- MARKETPLACE- IT WAS

00:58:07.450 --> 00:58:11.654
AN OBSERVABLE PHENOMENA AND-

00:58:11.721 --> 00:58:14.057
200-082-0009 TWO THOUSAND TEN-

00:58:14.123 --> 00:58:16.993
AND I THINK WE ARE JUST NOW

00:58:17.060 --> 00:58:18.094
STARTING TO SEE THE TIP OF THE

00:58:18.161 --> 00:58:21.231
ICEBERG BY. THE INCREASED

00:58:21.297 --> 00:58:25.201
VOLUME OF CONSUMER COMPLAINTS-

00:58:25.268 --> 00:58:27.904
AND SO I AND I UNDERSTAND- I

00:58:27.971 --> 00:58:30.173
UNDERSTAND SOME OF THE CONCERNS

00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:35.712
ABOUT THE LACK OF GRANULARITY

00:58:35.778 --> 00:58:38.648
AROUND FOR EXAMPLE- THE 40%

00:58:38.715 --> 00:58:41.284
SPIKE IN CONSUMER COMPLAINTS

00:58:41.351 --> 00:58:42.952
BUT I WOULD SUBMIT THAT THE-

00:58:43.019 --> 00:58:45.688
SURGE IN VOLUME- WITHIN THIS

00:58:45.755 --> 00:58:47.624
FIRST QUARTER ESSENTIALLY OF

00:58:47.690 --> 00:58:49.592
THE CODE AND DEMOCRATS- IS

00:58:49.659 --> 00:58:51.160
ITSELF. ILLUSTRATIVE IN

00:58:51.227 --> 00:58:54.931
TELLING- DENSO SENATOR WHAT

00:58:54.998 --> 00:58:56.866
WHAT I WOULD SAY IN THIS REGARD

00:58:56.933 --> 00:59:01.504
IS THAT WE HAVE I BELIEVE WE

00:59:01.571 --> 00:59:04.240
HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET OUT

00:59:04.307 --> 00:59:06.309
HOW DOES- WHAT WHAT IS

00:59:06.376 --> 00:59:08.912
POTENTIALLY- A VERY SEVERE AND

00:59:08.978 --> 00:59:10.747
DISASTROUS. ECONOMIC

00:59:10.813 --> 00:59:13.216
DISLOCATION FOR- FOR CALIFORNIA

00:59:13.283 --> 00:59:17.553
CONSUMERS- AND I THINK WE HAVE

00:59:17.620 --> 00:59:22.091
AN OPPORTUNITY TO- TO CHECK IN

00:59:22.158 --> 00:59:23.459
IN RE VISIT- PROGRESS

00:59:23.526 --> 00:59:25.828
INCREMENTAL STEPS. IF I'M WRONG

00:59:25.895 --> 00:59:27.597
ABOUT THAT PREDICTION I BELIEVE

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:30.600
ME I'M HAPPY TO BE WRONG- BUT I

00:59:30.667 --> 00:59:32.802

THE ATTORNEY. IS FAILING- OR

01:09:41.110 --> 01:09:43.712

INVESTIGATING AND PROSECUTING.

THE LAST DECADE. SO THIS

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:20.469

01:12:25.974 --> 01:12:28.010
SEED OF THE IDEA. OF EXPANDING

01:12:28.077 --> 01:12:30.679
YOUR DEPARTMENT CHANGING. WHAT

REPORT A STATE AUDITOR REPORT.

01:12:39.088 --> 01:12:41.156

01:12:41.223 --> 01:12:48.130
CONCERN ABOUT DODD FRANK. THANK

CONCERNS ABOUT DODD FRANK WERE-

01:12:51.633 --> 01:12:53.469
AS FACTOR BUT CERTAINLY NOT THE

01:12:53.535 --> 01:12:57.306
SINGLE FACTOR- I THINK THE

01:12:57.372 --> 01:12:59.274
UNDERLYING MOTIVATION REALLY

01:12:59.341 --> 01:13:03.912
HAD MORE TO DO WITH WITH THE

01:13:03.979 --> 01:13:05.547

QUESTION PREDATES THE CURRENT

01:13:21.797 --> 01:13:23.832
CODE PANDEMIC- BUT I THINK

01:13:23.899 --> 01:13:24.900
THERE'S A- THERE IS A REAL

01:13:24.967 --> 01:13:26.635
IMPRACTICAL RECOGNITION THAT

01:13:59.034 --> 01:14:02.137
FIELD- AND THEN SECONDLY YOU

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.306
KNOW THE QUESTION IS THAT THE

01:14:04.373 --> 01:14:06.675
SECOND QUESTION- THAT THIS

01:14:06.742 --> 01:14:07.309
PROPOSAL SEEKS THAT THE BALANCE

HOW IT IS. AND WE ENSURE THE

01:14:08.977 --> 01:14:11.280
CALIFORNIA REMAINS A LEADER IN

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:16.118
SERVICES AND THERE AGAIN THERE

01:14:16.185 --> 01:14:17.820
IS A PRACTICAL RECOGNITION OF

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:20.422
THE ACT THAT CALIFORNIA HAS-

01:14:20.489 --> 01:14:22.524
DANIEL LEADER IN INNOVATION

01:14:22.591 --> 01:14:24.293

01:14:45.447 --> 01:14:47.449
THAT THERE IS A TREND THERE

01:14:47.516 --> 01:14:50.953
THAT IS IRREVERSIBLE AND SO IT

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:53.021
IS IN MY VIEW JUST AS IMPORTANT

01:14:53.088 --> 01:14:54.823

WE- THAT THE DODD FRANK ACT IN

01:22:17.399 --> 01:22:20.268
EFFECT INVITED STATES TO

01:22:20.335 --> 01:22:22.437

01:22:22.504 --> 01:22:23.838
BEING PROPOSED HERE AND TO

01:22:23.905 --> 01:22:25.940

IN ORDER TO- PURSUE RESTITUTION

WITHOUT HAVING TO GO TO COURT

01:22:45.694 --> 01:22:51.032
SO I THINK THAT IS BEEN. BUT

01:22:51.099 --> 01:22:52.634
WHATEVER THE QUESTIONS ARE SO

01:22:52.701 --> 01:22:55.770
FAR ASKED IS PRETTY MUCH.

01:22:55.837 --> 01:22:57.072
ASCERTAINED THAT IT MIGHT

01:22:57.138 --> 01:23:02.644
CORRECT. I BELIEVE YOU'RE

01:23:02.711 --> 01:23:07.182
CORRECT SENATOR- THE PROVISION-

01:23:07.248 --> 01:23:08.883
I THINK THE PRINT THE MATERIAL

01:23:08.950 --> 01:23:09.484
PROVISION IN DODD FRANK

01:23:09.551 --> 01:23:11.486
PROVIDES THE STATE REGULATOR

MAY BRING A CIVIL ACTION OR

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:16.191
OTHER PROCEEDING SO THE FACT

01:23:16.257 --> 01:23:17.992
THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE SO YET

01:23:18.059 --> 01:23:19.728
MEANING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:23:19.794 --> 01:23:22.697
DIDN'T ACT YET WE I MEAN YES

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:24.466
CERTAINLY IT'S LOOK WE COULD

01:23:24.532 --> 01:23:26.701
ALLEGEDLY. DISCUSSED WHETHER WE

01:23:26.768 --> 01:23:30.138
FEEL IT'S- RIGHT THIS CURRENT

01:23:30.205 --> 01:23:31.406
MOMENT IS THE TIME TO DO SO

01:23:31.473 --> 01:23:33.575
BUT- THE FACT THAT WE HAVEN'T

01:23:33.641 --> 01:23:36.544
YET ISN'T A MATTER OF THAT IT

01:23:36.611 --> 01:23:40.348
IS NOT AN APPROPRIATE ACTION TO

01:23:40.415 --> 01:23:46.755
DO. N. A. I'M A WELL I SHARE

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:49.290
SOME CONCERNS ABOUT CREATING

01:23:49.357 --> 01:23:51.793
NEW POSITIONS RIGHT NOW IN THIS

01:23:51.860 --> 01:23:54.095
TIME OF- ECONOMIC DOWNTURN I'M

01:23:54.162 --> 01:23:57.031
ALSO QUITE AWARE- IN MY OWN

01:23:57.098 --> 01:23:58.400
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE JUST

01:23:58.466 --> 01:24:01.403
DEALT WITH THE SOME INCREASED-

01:24:01.469 --> 01:24:04.372
PENALTIES FOR I'M GONNA BLOW IT

01:24:04.439 --> 01:24:08.643
THE- OF PRICE GOUGING THE SO.

01:24:08.710 --> 01:24:10.211
THROUGH BASICALLY IN MY OWN

01:24:10.278 --> 01:24:11.713
PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE WE'VE

01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:12.781
BEEN DEALING WITH A NUMBER OF

01:24:12.847 --> 01:24:13.915
BILLS THAT WERE BROUGHT FORWARD

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:16.618
BECAUSE OF EGREGIOUS PRACTICES

01:24:16.684 --> 01:24:18.186
THE VARIOUS ENTITIES HAVE BEEN

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:19.721
ENGAGING IN NOW TO TAKE

01:24:19.788 --> 01:24:21.322
ADVANTAGE OF PEOPLE BECAUSE OF

01:24:21.389 --> 01:24:22.791
THE PRESSURE EITHER THEY'RE

01:24:22.857 --> 01:24:24.659
EXPERIENCING ECONOMICALLY OR DO

01:24:24.726 --> 01:24:26.861
DISCOVERED CRISIS SO IN THAT

01:24:26.928 --> 01:24:30.064
RESPECT. IT I FEEL THE ONE

01:24:30.131 --> 01:24:31.332
COULD MAKE A STRONG ARGUMENT

01:24:31.399 --> 01:24:33.268
THAT WHAT IS BEING PROPOSED

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:35.036
HERE IS NEEDED NOW BECAUSE OUR

01:24:35.103 --> 01:24:37.105
CONSUMERS ARE PARTICULARLY

01:24:37.172 --> 01:24:39.707
VULNERABLE AND ALSO FACING

01:24:39.774 --> 01:24:52.153
PARTICULAR- HARDSHIPS- D. THE

01:24:52.220 --> 01:24:54.856
MAIN QUESTION I THINK WAS

01:24:54.923 --> 01:24:55.890
REALLY BEEN ADDRESSED BECAUSE

01:24:55.957 --> 01:24:57.392
OF THEOTHER ONE I WAS GOING TO

01:24:57.459 --> 01:24:59.994
ASK IS- JUST THAT CONFORMITY

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:01.362
WITH DODD FRANK BUT I THINK

01:25:01.429 --> 01:25:03.264
ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE ADDRESSED

01:25:03.331 --> 01:25:06.234
THAT- AND YOU HAVE JUST

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:09.137
REINFORCE THAT IT'S THAT IT IS

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:12.273
OUR RIGHT. SO I FEEL LIKE THE

01:25:12.340 --> 01:25:14.142
ADMINISTRATION FROM THE

01:25:14.209 --> 01:25:16.144
PERSPECTIVE OF WHAT THE FEDERAL

01:25:16.211 --> 01:25:18.346
LAW ALLOWS US TO DO HAS TAKEN

01:25:18.413 --> 01:25:20.815
THE RIGHT APPROACH THEN I ALSO

01:25:20.882 --> 01:25:23.585
FEEL THAT RIGHT NOW WE ARE

01:25:23.651 --> 01:25:26.521
SEEING THAT- OUR CURRENT BREAKS

01:25:26.588 --> 01:25:29.524
DO YOU HAVE GAPS THAT HAVE LEFT

01:25:29.591 --> 01:25:30.892
THE NUMBER OF PRODUCTS SERVICES

01:25:30.959 --> 01:25:33.628
AND COMPANIES OUTSIDE OF OUR

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.964
DEPARTMENT SECURITY AND THAT

01:25:36.030 --> 01:25:37.932
THIS DOES BUILD ON THE MODEL

01:25:37.999 --> 01:25:39.000
THAT THE FEDERAL CONSUMER

01:25:39.067 --> 01:25:40.335
PROTECTION BUREAU WAS

01:25:40.401 --> 01:25:42.070
ESTABLISHED FOR HOWEVER

01:25:42.136 --> 01:25:44.539
UNFORTUNATELY THE FEDERAL THE

01:25:44.606 --> 01:25:46.541
FEDS HAVE GUTTED THAT SO THAT

01:25:46.608 --> 01:25:49.210
IS ANOTHER ARGUMENT I THINK FOR

01:25:49.277 --> 01:25:51.546
NOW IF THE- IF THE TERM

01:25:51.613 --> 01:25:52.614
PROTECTION BOROUGH FEDERALLY

01:25:52.680 --> 01:25:56.384
WAS WAS OPERATING AS IT WAS

01:25:56.451 --> 01:25:57.185
INTENDED IN FIRST ESTABLISHED.

01:25:57.252 --> 01:25:58.953
PERHAPS THAT WE NEED TO ACT

01:25:59.020 --> 01:26:01.789
RIGHT NOW BUT I THINK THAT

01:26:01.856 --> 01:26:03.925
BECAUSE WERE NOT BEING PROVIDED

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:05.760
THOSE SAFEGUARDS AND BECAUSE WE

01:26:05.827 --> 01:26:07.695
DO KNOW THAT OUR CONSUMERS ARE

01:26:07.762 --> 01:26:12.033
UNDER A LOT OF ODD DID JUDE-

01:26:12.100 --> 01:26:13.635
PRESSURE ALL GUESTS FOR LACK OF

01:26:13.701 --> 01:26:15.670
BETTER WORD THAT IT THIS SEEMS

01:26:15.737 --> 01:26:17.171
TO ME TO BE AN APPROPRIATE

01:26:17.238 --> 01:26:19.507
PROPOSAL RIGHT NOW AS DIFFICULT

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:24.045

OF ONE I DON'T WANT THAT. SO MY

01:29:56.858 --> 01:29:58.392
CONCERN IS THAT WHILE I

CERTAINLY- FIRST OF ALL. I

01:30:00.995 --> 01:30:02.130
APPRECIATE WHAT SENATOR RAZA

IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

PREDATION. IT'S GOING ON BUT

01:30:10.404 --> 01:30:11.773
I'M ALSO VERY CONCERNED THAT

01:30:11.839 --> 01:30:14.008
THAT THIS PROPOSAL HAS NOT BEEN

01:30:14.075 --> 01:30:16.110
VERY WELL THOUGHT OUT. AND SO

01:30:16.177 --> 01:30:17.145
WHAT HAPPENS IS AND THERE'S NOT

01:30:17.211 --> 01:30:18.312
ENOUGH BAND WITH INDIAN

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:20.381
MINISTRATION TO FIGURE THIS ALL

01:30:20.448 --> 01:30:21.449
OUT GIVEN THE STATE IT'S IN

01:30:21.516 --> 01:30:22.984
FRONT OF US. IN FACT I WOULD

01:30:23.050 --> 01:30:26.187
ARGUE. THAT IF PREDATION IS AND

01:30:26.254 --> 01:30:27.622
I'M NOT DISPUTING THAT THAT

01:30:27.688 --> 01:30:28.823
COULD BE AN ISSUE THAT PERHAPS

01:30:28.890 --> 01:30:29.557
THE GOVERNOR OUT CON

01:30:29.624 --> 01:30:31.159
EXTRAORDINARY SESSION SO WE

01:30:31.225 --> 01:30:32.193

01:30:32.260 --> 01:30:34.395
THROUGH THIS. FRANKLY YOU KNOW

01:30:34.462 --> 01:30:35.797
THIS TRYING TO DO THIS IN THE

01:30:35.863 --> 01:30:36.998
LAST MINUTE WITHOUT THINKING

01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:38.199
THESE THINGS OUT I JUST

01:30:38.266 --> 01:30:38.733
PURCHASED A VERY SIMPLE

01:30:38.800 --> 01:30:39.867
QUESTION AS A FOLLOW UP TO A

01:30:39.934 --> 01:30:41.202
QUESTION MY COLLEAGUE. YOU

01:30:41.269 --> 01:30:43.304
REALLY COULDN'T ANSWER CLEARLY.

01:30:43.371 --> 01:30:44.672

01:30:44.739 --> 01:30:45.807
PEOPLE ABOUT WHAT AT THE VOTING

01:30:45.873 --> 01:30:47.375
ON. IF YOU ASK ME TO VOTE ON

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:49.510
THIS I THINK THAT'S A PROBLEM

01:30:49.577 --> 01:30:50.678
SO PERHAPS THE PANEL CAN HELP

01:30:50.745 --> 01:30:51.946
CLARIFY BUT I ALSO THINK WE

01:30:52.013 --> 01:30:54.115
NEED TO HAVE A MUCH. CLEARER

01:30:54.182 --> 01:30:55.583

ESPECIALLY ON THIS MAGNITUDE.

01:31:02.423 --> 01:31:02.957
I'M NOT DISPUTING THE ISSUE OF

01:31:03.024 --> 01:31:03.624
THE PROBLEM BEFORE WE SHOULD BE.

01:31:03.691 --> 01:31:04.425
TO HAVE TO PASS IT I WOULD ALSO

01:31:04.492 --> 01:31:06.561
MAKE NOTE IS. AS AS YOU'VE

01:31:06.627 --> 01:31:07.762
NOTED BEFORE THAT EVEN THOUGH

01:31:07.829 --> 01:31:09.363
YOU HAVE TO SCOUR UNDER DODD

01:31:09.430 --> 01:31:10.898
FRANK THAT THE STATE APPARENTLY

01:31:10.965 --> 01:31:12.066
I'M NOT SAYING THAT MAYBE IT

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.634
WAS EXPENSIVE ENOUGH BUT- DODD

01:31:13.701 --> 01:31:15.536
FRANK APPARENTLY. IT WAS NEVER

01:31:15.603 --> 01:31:17.071
REQUIRES. AT LEAST A STATE

01:31:18.873 --> 01:31:21.209
AGAIN DEFINES EXACTLY WHAT THE

01:31:21.275 --> 01:31:21.809

WHO WOULD BE REGISTRANTS HE AND

01:46:57.077 --> 01:46:58.912
THE LACK OF CLARITY IN THE

01:46:58.979 --> 01:47:00.981
PROPOSAL IS VERY TROUBLING. AS

01:47:01.047 --> 01:47:03.416
THE L. A. L. NOTED THIS DOES

01:47:03.483 --> 01:47:06.219
SEATED A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:47:06.286 --> 01:47:06.787
FORTY TO THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:47:06.853 --> 01:47:09.456
BRANCH. AS SUCH WE THINK THE

01:47:09.523 --> 01:47:11.291
LANGUAGE AROUND REGULATION

01:47:11.358 --> 01:47:12.893
SHOULD BE CLARIFIED.

01:47:12.959 --> 01:47:14.294
SPECIFICALLY THROUGHOUT THE

01:47:14.361 --> 01:47:17.397
BILL IT PROVIDES THAT D. FBI

01:47:17.464 --> 01:47:19.132
MAY PROMULGATE REGULATIONS

01:47:19.199 --> 01:47:21.101
CONCERNING REGISTRATION. MAY

CONCERNING DISCLOSURE. RECORDS

01:47:24.671 --> 01:47:27.274
RETENTION- AND ON AND ON AND

01:47:27.340 --> 01:47:30.443
ON. FRANKLY I DON'T UNDERSTAND

01:47:30.510 --> 01:47:31.511
HOW THE REGULATED COMMUNITY-

01:47:31.578 --> 01:47:34.881
REGISTRANTS CAN ADHERE TO RULES

01:47:34.948 --> 01:47:36.817
THAT THEY DON'T KNOW EXIST.

01:47:36.883 --> 01:47:39.052
THIS IS EASILY RECTIFIED IF THE

01:47:39.119 --> 01:47:41.588
WORD MAY IS REPLACED WITH SHALL

01:47:41.655 --> 01:47:43.156
THROUGHOUT THE PROPOSAL AT

01:47:43.223 --> 01:47:45.892
LEAST THEN. THE REGULATE

01:47:45.959 --> 01:47:46.760
COMMUNITY WOULD HAVE AN

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:48.395
OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN ON THE

01:47:48.461 --> 01:47:50.897
PROCESS AND AT LEAST UNDERSTAND

01:47:50.964 --> 01:47:53.433
WHAT THEY ARE SUBJECT. TO

01:47:53.500 --> 01:47:55.635
SOMETHING THAT SENATOR COUNTY

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:58.305
RAISED. HAD TO DO WITH THE

01:47:58.371 --> 01:48:00.707
NUMBERS OF GROUPS INVOLVED-

01:48:00.774 --> 01:48:01.741
THERE IS ACTUALLY ONE

01:48:01.808 --> 01:48:03.310
ADDITIONAL GROUP OF IRAQIS TO

01:48:03.376 --> 01:48:04.978
BE COVERED BY THIS BILL. AND

01:48:05.045 --> 01:48:07.214
THAT ARE THAT IS COMPANIES OR

01:48:07.280 --> 01:48:10.650
ENTITIES WHO ARE NOT LICENSED.

01:48:10.717 --> 01:48:12.018
BUT WHO ARE REGULATED BY THE

01:48:12.085 --> 01:48:14.221
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE- THERE

01:48:14.287 --> 01:48:15.889
ARE A HOST OF BACKS FROM THE

01:48:15.956 --> 01:48:17.691
CARNEDDAU REESE LEVERING AND

01:48:17.757 --> 01:48:19.593
CHECK CASHIER'S. WHO ARE

01:48:19.659 --> 01:48:21.695
SUBJECT TO AUTHORITY BY THE

01:48:21.761 --> 01:48:23.196
DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE TODAY.

01:48:23.263 --> 01:48:24.798
THE CONCERN WE HAVE THE BILL WE

01:48:24.865 --> 01:48:27.234
WILL CERTAINLY RAISE THIS WITH-

01:48:27.300 --> 01:48:30.971
DPO IS AS DRAFTED. D. O. J.

01:48:31.037 --> 01:48:32.372
COULD BRING AN ACTION FOR A

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:35.609
VIOLATION- FROM ONE OF THEIR

01:48:35.675 --> 01:48:38.144
REGULATED ENTITIES. THE FBI

01:48:38.211 --> 01:48:39.613
COULD THEN BRINGTHE EXACT SAME

01:48:39.679 --> 01:48:41.748
CIVIL ACTION ALLEGING THAT YOU

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:43.516
THAT WHILE ISSUE AGAINST THAT

01:48:43.583 --> 01:48:45.752
SAME EDUCATE. THIS MEANS THE

01:48:45.819 --> 01:48:47.854
ENTITIES ARE ALREADY COVERED BY

01:48:47.921 --> 01:48:49.856
EXISTING LAW WHO ARE UNLICENSED

01:48:49.923 --> 01:48:51.691
WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED- MORE

01:48:51.758 --> 01:48:53.760
STRIDENT OVERSIGHT THAT

01:48:53.827 --> 01:48:54.494
ENTITIES THAT ARE COMPLETELY

01:48:54.561 --> 01:48:56.229
UNREGULATED WE THINK THIS

01:48:56.296 --> 01:48:59.866
pTOO AGENCY SHOULDN'T BE ABLE TO

01:48:59.933 --> 01:49:02.769
GO OUT TO THE SAME ENTITY WITH

01:49:02.836 --> 01:49:05.805
THE EXACT SAME THING. FINALLY

01:49:05.872 --> 01:49:07.107
THERE'S A PROVISION IN THE

01:49:07.173 --> 01:49:07.874
GOVERNMENT COAT THAT'S

01:49:07.941 --> 01:49:09.109
REFERENCED IN THE BILL THAT

01:49:09.175 --> 01:49:11.011
DEALS WITH DUE PROCESS I'M NOT

01:49:11.077 --> 01:49:12.979
SURE IF THIS IS A TYPE OR NOT.

01:49:13.046 --> 01:49:14.414
BUT THE BILL ONLY REFERENCES

01:49:14.481 --> 01:49:16.216
HALF OF THE GOVERNMENT CODE

01:49:16.283 --> 01:49:17.284
LEAVES OUT THE DUE PROCESS

01:49:17.350 --> 01:49:18.885
PROVISIONS THIS IS EASILY

01:49:18.952 --> 01:49:21.421
FIXED. AND THE BILL PROVIDES

01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:23.089
THAT THE DEPARTMENT MAY RECOVER

01:49:23.156 --> 01:49:25.058
ATTORNEY'S FEES AND COURT

01:49:25.125 --> 01:49:28.061
ACTION. IF THEY PREVAIL HOWEVER

01:49:28.128 --> 01:49:29.996
IF THEY LOSE THE PARTY THAT

01:49:30.063 --> 01:49:31.431
PREVAILED IS NOT ENTITLED TO

01:49:31.498 --> 01:49:33.433
ATTORNEYS FEES. WE THINK THIS

01:49:33.500 --> 01:49:36.069
IS INEQUITABLE WE ASK THAT THIS

01:49:36.136 --> 01:49:38.571
BE. FIXED WE PROVIDE ALL THESE

01:49:38.638 --> 01:49:40.607
SUGGESTIONS TO THAT APARTMENT.

01:49:40.674 --> 01:49:42.442
AND WITH TWO WEEKS LEFT TO GO

01:49:42.509 --> 01:49:44.244
WE'VE NOT HEARD BACK ON THEM.

01:49:44.311 --> 01:49:45.512
AND WOULD WELCOME THE

01:49:45.578 --> 01:49:47.047
INVOLVEMENT OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:49:47.113 --> 01:49:48.782
TO RECTIFY THESE PROBLEMS THANK

01:49:48.848 --> 01:49:49.950

01:49:50.016 --> 01:49:53.887

AFTERNOON- BEFORE I OPEN UP TO

01:49:57.457 --> 01:49:58.858
THE FLOOR I WOULD JUST SAY THE

01:49:58.925 --> 01:50:01.061
MISS- BOTTLE I WAS INTRIGUED BY

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:02.329
YOUR COMMENT ABOUT AN ANTI

01:50:02.395 --> 01:50:03.763
DISPLACEMENT CODE OF CONDUCT

01:50:03.830 --> 01:50:05.365
AND SO IF YOU COULD. TO SINCE

01:50:05.432 --> 01:50:07.400
THEN BACKGROUND MATERIALS TO MY

01:50:07.467 --> 01:50:08.935
OFFICE I WOULD APPRECIATE THAT.

01:50:09.002 --> 01:50:11.404
QUESTIONS MEMBERS HAVE.

01:50:11.471 --> 01:50:13.940
QUESTIONS OF THE PANEL. SENATOR

01:50:14.007 --> 01:50:18.578
PAN. THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THE

01:50:18.645 --> 01:50:19.980
PRESENTATION BY THE PANEL ON

01:50:20.046 --> 01:50:21.548
THE DIFFERENT IDEAS AND

01:50:21.614 --> 01:50:23.850
CONCEPTS THAT WERE PUT FORTH I

01:50:23.917 --> 01:50:26.519
GUESS WHY DON'T. WHERE I DON'T

01:50:26.586 --> 01:50:28.722
SEE AND I HOPE THAT WILL HAPPEN

01:50:28.788 --> 01:50:30.390
IS SORT OF A CONNECTION BETWEEN

01:50:30.457 --> 01:50:32.993
THE PRESS. LEAST WHAT IS IN THE

01:50:33.059 --> 01:50:35.095
TRAILER BILL AND SOME OF THESE

01:50:35.161 --> 01:50:36.463
IDEAS WHICH I THINK MANY OF

01:50:36.529 --> 01:50:41.034
THEM ARE VERY GOOD- SO. AS I

01:50:41.101 --> 01:50:42.369
EXPRESSED IN MY EARLIER QUITE

01:50:42.435 --> 01:50:43.803
YOU KNOW QUESTIONS WHY I'M

01:50:43.870 --> 01:50:45.939
CONCERNED IS THAT WERE BEING

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:47.440
ASKED ARE I KNOW THIS

01:50:47.507 --> 01:50:48.441
INFORMATIONAL HEARING WILL

01:50:48.508 --> 01:50:50.310
EVENTUALLY BE ASKED TO VOTE ON

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:54.381
A- TRAILER BILL AND I CERTAINLY

01:50:54.447 --> 01:50:55.582
HAVE SOME CONCERNS WHETHER THIS

01:50:55.648 --> 01:50:58.284
IS REALLY TRAILER BILL VERSUS-

01:50:58.351 --> 01:50:59.819
POLICY BILL THAT WE WON'T GET

01:50:59.886 --> 01:51:01.755
INTO THAT TOO MUCH WE DO DO. IT

01:51:01.821 --> 01:51:03.490
SOMETIMES THINGS HAPPEN BUT BUT

01:51:03.556 --> 01:51:05.291
THAT IT'S NOT VETTED WELL

01:51:05.358 --> 01:51:07.460
ENOUGH AND IN FACT- THAT WAY I

01:51:07.527 --> 01:51:08.661
DON'T WANT TO HAVE HAPPEN IS

01:51:08.728 --> 01:51:10.563
BASICALLY A SORT OF A CATCHALL

01:51:10.630 --> 01:51:11.831
TRAILER BILL THAT SAYS YOU KNOW

01:51:11.898 --> 01:51:12.465
WHAT THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD

01:51:12.532 --> 01:51:15.301
IDEAS OUT THERE- NO LEGISLATIVE

01:51:15.368 --> 01:51:17.704
OVERSIGHT. WE EXPECT INDUSTRIES

01:51:17.771 --> 01:51:18.271
IS GONNA CARRY THEM OUT AND

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:20.106
HOPE THAT YOU DO THAT. RIGHT I

01:51:20.173 --> 01:51:21.107
MEAN I THINK WE NEED TO BE MUCH

01:51:21.174 --> 01:51:23.276
MORE SPECIFIC- THERE NEEDS TO

01:51:23.343 --> 01:51:25.178
BE MUCH MORE SPECIFICITY ABOUT

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:26.946
WHO WILL FALL UNDER THIS I MEAN

01:51:27.013 --> 01:51:28.515
WHEN I POSE THE QUESTION ABOUT.

01:51:28.581 --> 01:51:30.683
THE ODD COMMISSIONER REALLY ANY

01:51:30.750 --> 01:51:31.785
DANCER I THINK WAS A LITTLE

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:34.320
CONCERNING- THAT NEEDS TO BE

01:51:34.387 --> 01:51:35.789
VERY MUCH CLARIFIED WHO FALLS

01:51:35.855 --> 01:51:37.524
UNDER THIS BILL WHAT'S THE

01:51:37.590 --> 01:51:40.260
SCOPE OF THIS AGENCY- I GET IT

01:51:40.326 --> 01:51:41.561
YOU HAVE ON THE OF PEOPLE WHO

01:51:41.628 --> 01:51:44.798
ARE NOT LICENSED DAY OF PRIDE

01:51:44.864 --> 01:51:48.835
THE DETAILED. OVERSIGHT LORALAI.

01:51:48.902 --> 01:51:50.303
WHAT MISSING FOR THERE OVER.

01:51:50.370 --> 01:51:51.271
THAT THEIR CURRENT LICENSE

01:51:51.337 --> 01:51:53.073
DOESN'T COVER ANY WE DON'T WANT

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:53.640
TO HAVE PEOPLE HAVING TO

01:51:53.706 --> 01:51:56.076
RESPOND TO. MULTIPLE AGENCIES

01:51:56.142 --> 01:51:57.377
WHO WHICH MAY EVEN HAVE GIVE

01:51:57.444 --> 01:51:58.711
CONFLICTING GUIDANCE I MEAN

01:51:58.778 --> 01:52:00.313
THAT'S AN ISSUE AS WELL THAT.

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:01.881
THAT WOULD ACTUALLY STYMIE OUR

01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:03.416
LIMIT POTENTIALLY ACCESS TO

01:52:03.483 --> 01:52:05.618
CREDIT THAT PEOPLE CAN GET. AS

01:52:05.685 --> 01:52:08.621
WELL- WE ALSO WE ONLY LIKE TO

01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:10.390
DISCOURAGE. THAT BEHAVIOR THAT

01:52:10.457 --> 01:52:11.825
ISN'T GOOD FOR COMMUNITIES AND

01:52:11.891 --> 01:52:12.559
I APPRECIATE SOME OF THOSE

01:52:12.625 --> 01:52:13.960
PRESENTATIONS WHICH MAY NOT

01:52:14.027 --> 01:52:15.795
STRICTLY BE IN A LENDING

01:52:15.862 --> 01:52:18.231
PRACTICES PER SE BUT ALSO BUT

01:52:18.298 --> 01:52:19.299
YOU KNOW I'M FIGURE HAVE

01:52:19.365 --> 01:52:21.501
INCORPORATE SOME OF THAT- SO I

01:52:21.568 --> 01:52:24.204
GUESS WHAT I JUST SAY IS THAT-

01:52:24.270 --> 01:52:25.772
CERTAINLY THIS INFORMATION

01:52:25.839 --> 01:52:26.606
HEARINGS BEEN RAIN AND

01:52:26.673 --> 01:52:29.809
LIGHTNING- BUT- I. YEAH WE HAVE

01:52:29.876 --> 01:52:31.578
TO DO THIS RIGHT. AND I

01:52:31.644 --> 01:52:33.079
CERTAINLY HEAR THE URGENCY

01:52:33.146 --> 01:52:34.714
ISSUE I'M NOT DENYING THE

01:52:34.781 --> 01:52:36.583
URGENCY BUT THE URGENCY ALONE

01:52:36.649 --> 01:52:38.084
IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO SAY WE'RE

01:52:38.151 --> 01:52:41.121
GOING TO PASS. A BETTER POLICY

01:52:41.187 --> 01:52:42.322
THAT IS THAT IS NOT WELL

01:52:42.388 --> 01:52:43.790
THOUGHT OUT AND IT IT AND

01:52:43.857 --> 01:52:45.792
FRANKLY I DO ALSO WANT TO JUST

01:52:45.859 --> 01:52:47.961
AGAIN SECOND THE- WHAT SENATOR

01:52:48.027 --> 01:52:49.696
RAZA SAID IS THAT IT'S- THE-

01:52:49.762 --> 01:52:51.164
OTHER QUESTION IS THERE TO BAN

01:52:51.231 --> 01:52:53.533
WITHIN THE- ADMINISTRATION TO

01:52:53.600 --> 01:52:54.701
SPEND THE TIME TO DO THIS

01:52:54.767 --> 01:52:56.536
RIGHT. AND RECOGNIZING THAT WE

01:52:56.603 --> 01:52:57.504
ALSO HAVE OTHER PRIORITIES WERE

01:52:57.570 --> 01:52:59.405
DOING NOT SAYING THAT WE CAN'T

01:52:59.472 --> 01:53:01.641
DO THIS. BUT I WANT TO SEE A

01:53:01.708 --> 01:53:02.075
COMMITMENT FROM THE

01:53:02.142 --> 01:53:04.277
ADMINISTRATION. TO REALLY WORK

01:53:04.344 --> 01:53:06.212
THESE THINGS OUT NOT EXPECT THE

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:07.347
LEGISLATURE SIMPLY TO SAY YOU

01:53:07.413 --> 01:53:08.548
KNOW WHAT WE'RE GONNA PASS AND

01:53:08.615 --> 01:53:10.183
OPEN ENDED ONE AND THEN WE'LL

PROTECTION AGENCY HOW CAN YOU

SPEAK TO AT LEAST FOR THE

01:54:13.146 --> 01:54:14.681
REGULATED COMMUNITY THAT

01:54:14.747 --> 01:54:16.616
THEY'RE NOT CAUGHT BETWEEN THE

01:54:16.683 --> 01:54:18.218
CROSSFIRE OF THE STATE AND

01:54:18.284 --> 01:54:19.919
FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS TRYING TO.

01:54:19.986 --> 01:54:22.488
ONE UP EACH OTHER WITH REGARD

01:54:22.555 --> 01:54:23.690
TO TRYING TO PROVIDE FINANCIAL

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:26.292
SERVICES AND CONDUCT BUSINESS

01:54:26.359 --> 01:54:30.129
IN THIS ARENA. THANK YOU

01:54:30.196 --> 01:54:34.434
SENATOR. ONE POINT. IS THE ONE

01:54:34.500 --> 01:54:35.735
I MADE BEFORE WHICH IS THAT

01:54:35.802 --> 01:54:37.103
CALIFORNIA SHOULDN'T HAVE TO

01:54:37.170 --> 01:54:38.371
DEPEND ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:39.672
WASHINGTON IS THE WEATHER

01:54:39.739 --> 01:54:41.474
CALIFORNIANS GIVE PROTECTION

01:54:41.541 --> 01:54:44.410
AGAINST FINANCIAL ABUSE AND THE

01:54:44.477 --> 01:54:46.613
POINT THAT WAS MADE EARLIER BY

01:54:46.679 --> 01:54:50.917
THE QUESTIONS. FROM SENATOR RON

01:54:50.984 --> 01:54:54.554
AND OTHERS WAS THAT THE FEDERAL

01:54:54.621 --> 01:54:56.589
LAW HAD NOT BEEN USED BY THE

01:54:56.656 --> 01:54:58.791
CALIFORNIA AGENCY YEAH I THINK

01:54:58.858 --> 01:55:00.493
THAT'S KIND OF TO BE EXPECTED

01:55:00.560 --> 01:55:02.128
IT'S NOT A NATURAL THING FOR A

01:55:02.195 --> 01:55:03.796
STATE AGENCY TO TRY TO ENFORCE

01:55:03.863 --> 01:55:05.865
FEDERAL LAW AND TRY TO CRAM IT

01:55:05.932 --> 01:55:07.500
INTO EXISTING STATE LICENSE

01:55:07.567 --> 01:55:09.168
ACTIONS AND IT'S NOT

01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:11.004
NECESSARILY A CLEARLY SUBJECT

01:55:11.070 --> 01:55:12.805
THE CALIFORNIA EIGHTY A THE KEY

01:55:12.872 --> 01:55:14.641
HERE IS TO GET THIS PROTECTION

01:55:14.707 --> 01:55:17.143
IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE LAW.

01:55:17.210 --> 01:55:19.579
THE DEPARTMENT KNOWS VERY WELL

01:55:19.646 --> 01:55:21.581
HOW IT CAN WORK WITH THAT IT

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:23.116
KNOWS THE PROPER PROCESSES IN

01:55:23.182 --> 01:55:25.652
LICENSE ACTIONS IT IS SUBJECT

01:55:25.718 --> 01:55:27.053
TO CALIFORNIA'S DUE PROCESS

01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:28.087
PROVISION THE CALIFORNIA

01:55:28.154 --> 01:55:31.524
CONSTITUTION AND ALSO WITH THE

01:55:31.591 --> 01:55:32.125
EIGHTY EIGHT SO THAT'S

01:55:32.191 --> 01:55:33.426
IMPORTANT THE OTHER POINT I

01:55:33.493 --> 01:55:34.861
WOULD MAKE IS WHEN I WAS THE

01:55:34.927 --> 01:55:36.262
DIRECTOR OF THE FEDERAL CFPB

01:55:36.329 --> 01:55:37.997
AND WE WERE MORE AGGRESSIVE

01:55:38.064 --> 01:55:39.932
CLEARLY THEN THE CFPB HAS BEEN

01:55:39.999 --> 01:55:41.434
IT'S ALMOST BEEN PARALYZED IN

01:55:41.501 --> 01:55:43.136
TERMS OF ENFORCING THE LAW. WE

01:55:43.202 --> 01:55:45.471
KNEW WE COULDN'T POSSIBLY ASK

01:55:45.538 --> 01:55:47.206
ALL THE CONCERNS AND ISSUES

01:55:47.273 --> 01:55:49.242
THAT WOULD BEING RAISED IN A

01:55:49.309 --> 01:55:51.377
STATE LIKE CALIFORNIA WE DIDN'T

01:55:51.444 --> 01:55:52.645
KNOW THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AS

01:55:52.712 --> 01:55:55.048
WELL WE WOULD SOMETIMES GET

01:55:55.114 --> 01:55:56.316
REFERRALS AND THINGS AND WE

01:55:56.382 --> 01:56:03.289
WOULD ACT. THE BEST SITUATION

01:56:03.356 --> 01:56:04.390
IS TO HAVE A REAL PARTNERSHIP

01:56:04.457 --> 01:56:06.192
WITH. OFFICIALS ARE OUT FOR

01:56:06.259 --> 01:56:07.327
CALIFORNIA. FOR NOT HAVING TO

01:56:07.393 --> 01:56:08.227
ON WHAT HOW IN WASHINGTON DC

01:56:08.294 --> 01:56:09.729
BUT IF THERE IS APPETITE AND-

01:56:09.796 --> 01:56:11.164
DC TO WERE WITH THEM. BUT

01:56:11.230 --> 01:56:12.231
THERE'S JOIN EFFORTS AND

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:13.333
COOPERATION COOPERATIVE

01:56:13.399 --> 01:56:14.867
FEDERALISM WHICH IS WHAT THE

01:56:14.934 --> 01:56:17.437
DODD FRANK ACT. PROVIDED FOR

01:56:17.503 --> 01:56:18.738
THE CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO ACCEPT

01:56:18.805 --> 01:56:20.206
THIS INVITATION IN ORDER TO

01:56:20.273 --> 01:56:21.774
MAKE THAT REAL AND FRANKLY

01:56:21.841 --> 01:56:23.276
NEEDS TO ACCEPT IT NOW BECAUSE

01:56:23.343 --> 01:56:24.577
IF YOU PUT THIS FACT INTO

01:56:24.644 --> 01:56:26.012
ANOTHER PROCESS. IT'LL BE

01:56:26.079 --> 01:56:27.547
ANOTHER YEAR AND THEN ANOTHER

01:56:27.613 --> 01:56:28.948
YEAR AFTER THAT BEFORE IT

THIS WHOLE CRISIS ALTOGETHER.

01:56:31.818 --> 01:56:33.486
THAT WOULD BE A TRAGEDY FOR

01:56:33.553 --> 01:56:34.721
CALIFORNIANS BUT I THINK

01:56:34.787 --> 01:56:38.658

TO WAIT TILL AFTER THE PANEL

01:57:01.748 --> 01:57:02.782
HAD AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK

01:57:02.849 --> 01:57:03.983
BECAUSE I WANTED TO HEAR WITH

01:57:04.050 --> 01:57:05.651

01:57:09.389 --> 01:57:12.525
HAVE BEEN RAISED IN REGARDS TO-

01:57:12.592 --> 01:57:13.459
THE NEED TO PROTECT THE

01:57:13.526 --> 01:57:15.128
COMMUNITY THERE'S NO QUESTION I

01:57:15.194 --> 01:57:17.430
MEAN THAT THAT IN MY MIND AT

01:57:17.497 --> 01:57:18.164
EASE AND QUESTIONED ITS IT'S

01:57:18.231 --> 01:57:20.233
REALLY WHAT. WHAT D. B. O.'S

01:57:20.299 --> 01:57:22.735
CORE MISSION IS IN AND IN FACT

01:57:22.802 --> 01:57:24.270
ALL OF THE REGULATORY AGENCIES

01:57:24.337 --> 01:57:26.439
THAT LOCAL OVERLOOK LICENSEES

01:57:26.506 --> 01:57:28.541
IN THAT THAT- THAT DO HEIR

01:57:28.608 --> 01:57:31.010
ENFORCEMENT MY CONCERN IS THIS

01:57:31.077 --> 01:57:33.746
AND I. AND I GUESS. THERE'S A

01:57:33.813 --> 01:57:34.881
WOULD TO ME THERE'S THIS

01:57:34.947 --> 01:57:37.917
DISCONNECT. I'M ASSUMING WE

01:57:37.984 --> 01:57:41.287
PASS THIS. TODAY WHENEVER WE

01:57:41.354 --> 01:57:44.323
FINALLY GET IT FOR A VOTE ON

01:57:44.390 --> 01:57:45.858
THE FIRST YEAR IS IT IS A IS A

01:57:45.925 --> 01:57:47.860
SKELETAL COMPOSITION IS WHAT I

01:57:47.927 --> 01:57:51.431
HEARD AND- AND SO TO THINK THAT

01:57:51.497 --> 01:57:54.300
THIS BILL OR THIS TRAILER BILL

01:57:54.367 --> 01:57:56.636
WILL ACTUALLY START IMPACTING.

01:57:56.702 --> 01:58:00.273
THE UNREGULATED UNLICENSED

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:02.875
ENTITIES THAT ARE ACTING RIGHT

01:58:02.942 --> 01:58:04.277
NOW I JUST THINK IT'S

01:58:04.343 --> 01:58:06.012
UNREALISTIC I DON'T I DON'T SEE

01:58:06.078 --> 01:58:07.814
IT HAPPENING IN AND MAYBE I'M

01:58:07.880 --> 01:58:09.749
I'M WRONG BUT- BUT I UNDERSTAND

01:58:09.816 --> 01:58:11.217
HOW THE REGULATORY PROCESS

01:58:11.284 --> 01:58:13.519
WORKS HAVING. SUPERVISED THAT

01:58:13.586 --> 01:58:16.322
BEFORE AND IT TAKES A WHILE TO

01:58:16.389 --> 01:58:20.126
ON. IT TAKES A WHILE BASICALLY

01:58:20.193 --> 01:58:21.294
TO HIRE STAFF TO GET HIM

01:58:21.360 --> 01:58:23.029
TRAINED TO GET HIM WORKING

01:58:23.095 --> 01:58:24.130
TOGETHER TO GET THE REGULATIONS

01:58:24.197 --> 01:58:26.732
IN ORDER. AND THEN TO START

01:58:26.799 --> 01:58:29.569
DOING THAT THE OVERSIGHT THAT'S

01:58:29.635 --> 01:58:31.270
NEEDED THAT'S NOT TO SAY IT'S

01:58:31.337 --> 01:58:34.073
NOT NEEDED. RIGHT NOW I'M JUST

01:58:34.140 --> 01:58:35.842
SAYING THAT THAT I DON'T SEE I

01:58:35.908 --> 01:58:37.210
DON'T SEE IT HAPPENING AND SO

01:58:37.276 --> 01:58:38.244
PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT I

01:58:38.311 --> 01:58:39.912
HAVE IS I THOUGHT THE QUESTIONS

01:58:39.979 --> 01:58:40.480
THAT WERE ASKED TODAY WERE

01:58:40.546 --> 01:58:42.448
EXCELLENT I. I HAD A I'VE GOT

01:58:42.515 --> 01:58:44.617
I'VE GOT A BUNCH AND EVERY

01:58:44.684 --> 01:58:45.718
SINGLE ONE OF A MORE ASKED BY

01:58:45.785 --> 01:58:47.320
SOMEONE ELSE AND SO THE

01:58:47.386 --> 01:58:50.990
CHALLENGE FOR ME IS PROCESS. IS

01:58:51.057 --> 01:58:53.493
THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED THAT

01:58:53.559 --> 01:58:55.928
THE WAY THAT WE STAND UP A

01:58:55.995 --> 01:58:56.896
REORGANIZATION OF THE

01:58:56.963 --> 01:58:58.998
DEPARTMENT BOB IS USUALLY TWO

01:58:59.065 --> 01:59:01.267
FOLD ONE IS IT'S THROUGH THE

01:59:01.334 --> 01:59:03.269
BUDGET I MEAN THROUGH THE- A

01:59:03.336 --> 01:59:05.238
BILLPROCESS YOU GET SOME

01:59:05.304 --> 01:59:06.405
LEGISLATOR TO KERRY THE

01:59:06.472 --> 01:59:07.807
ADMINISTRATION'S BILL AND TO

01:59:07.874 --> 01:59:08.674
TAKE IT TO THE POLICY

01:59:08.741 --> 01:59:11.210
COMMITTEES. OR YOU TAKE UP THE

01:59:11.277 --> 01:59:14.247
PROCESS THAT IS WRITTEN. I

01:59:14.313 --> 01:59:15.248
BELIEVE IT'S IN THE

01:59:15.314 --> 01:59:16.749
CONSTITUTION THE TAKE YOU TAKE

01:59:16.816 --> 01:59:18.518
IT THROUGH THE LITTLE HOOVER

01:59:18.584 --> 01:59:19.952
COMMISSION AND WHAT YOU DO IS

01:59:20.019 --> 01:59:21.654
YOU HAVE A BUSINESS PLAN AND

01:59:21.721 --> 01:59:23.022
THE BUT THE BUSINESS PLAN

01:59:23.089 --> 01:59:25.024
ARTICULATES EXACTLY WHAT IT IS

01:59:25.091 --> 01:59:26.325
YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH

01:59:26.392 --> 01:59:28.828
WITH A REORGANIZATION. IT GOES

01:59:28.895 --> 01:59:29.896
THROUGH THE LITTLE HOOVER

01:59:29.962 --> 01:59:31.531
COMMISSION THEY HOLD HEARINGS

01:59:31.597 --> 01:59:33.933
AND THEN THAT PLAN COMES TO THE

01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.768
LEGISLATURE AND WE EITHER GIVE

01:59:35.835 --> 01:59:37.503
IT THE THUMBS UP OR THE THUMBS

01:59:37.570 --> 01:59:39.038
DOWN WE CAN'T CHANGE IT WE

01:59:39.105 --> 01:59:42.241
CAN'T AMENDED. ON IT IT IT IT

01:59:42.308 --> 01:59:44.076
IT EXISTS AS AS IT TOO IT WAS

01:59:44.143 --> 01:59:45.845
WRITTEN BY THE ADMINISTRATION

01:59:45.912 --> 01:59:47.513
AND NEITHER OF THOSE WORDS WERE

01:59:47.580 --> 01:59:49.549
DOWN HERE AND THAT. THOSE

01:59:49.615 --> 01:59:51.017
PROCESSES GIVE US AN

01:59:51.083 --> 01:59:52.385
OPPORTUNITY TO HEAR THIS CAN

01:59:52.451 --> 01:59:54.554
THIS IN COMMITTEE AND REALLY

01:59:54.620 --> 01:59:56.022
HAVE A GOOD SENSE OF WHO ARE WE

01:59:56.088 --> 01:59:57.657
TRYING TO REGULATE. IT OR THE

01:59:57.723 --> 01:59:59.191
REGULATION WHAT'S THE FRAMEWORK

01:59:59.258 --> 02:00:01.160
FOR THE REGULATION WHO'S GOING

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:02.495
TO DO IT HOW DID IT HOW IS IT

02:00:02.562 --> 02:00:03.729
GOING TO HAPPEN AND THEN WHAT

02:00:03.796 --> 02:00:05.331
IS IT GOING TO COST AND THAT

02:00:05.398 --> 02:00:07.133
HASN'T THAT HASN'T HAPPENED

02:00:07.199 --> 02:00:08.334
WE'VE WE'VE TRIED TO DO IT.

ABOUT SB NINE OH EIGHT PASSES

AND IF IT DOES. WE WOULD TAKE

02:04:17.082 --> 02:04:19.218
THE CONSIDERATIONS OF WHAT THIS

02:04:19.285 --> 02:04:23.122
PROPOSAL COSTS- IF IT PASSES

02:04:23.189 --> 02:04:23.656
AND THEN IF SB NINE AWAIT

02:04:23.722 --> 02:04:26.325
PASSES. THE DEPARTMENT WOULD

02:04:26.392 --> 02:04:27.893
PUT TOGETHER B. C. P. AND THE

02:04:27.960 --> 02:04:29.862
NEXT GOVERNOR'S BUDGET AND TAKE

INTO ACCOUNT THE COST

02:04:30.396 --> 02:04:31.797
DIFFERENCES SO IT WOULDN'T BE A

02:04:31.864 --> 02:04:32.531
DUPLICATION OF COST OR EFFORT

02:04:32.598 --> 02:04:34.166
BUT IT WOULD FACTOR IN THIS

02:04:34.233 --> 02:04:36.769
PROPOSAL AS WELL- AND WE'D LIKE

I'D ALSO LIKE TO. DRESS THE

02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:44.977
PART ABOUT THE ORGANIZATION WE

02:04:45.044 --> 02:04:46.846
DON'T SEE THIS AS A TYPICAL

02:04:46.912 --> 02:04:48.848
WE'RE WE ORGANIZATION IT'S MORE

02:04:48.914 --> 02:04:50.616
OF A ADDITION TO THE DEPARTMENT

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:51.851
SO I THINK IF WE WEREN'T

02:04:51.917 --> 02:04:54.019
CHANGING THE NAME OF BUSINESS

02:04:54.086 --> 02:04:55.387

PROTECTION AND INNOVATION THERE

02:04:57.756 --> 02:04:58.190
MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS

02:04:58.257 --> 02:04:59.558
CONFUSION ON THAT BECAUSE IT'S

02:04:59.625 --> 02:05:01.126
THAT WERE SIMPLY ADDING NEW

02:05:01.193 --> 02:05:02.094
FUNCTION TO AN EXISTING

02:05:02.161 --> 02:05:04.330
DEPARTMENT. SO THAT'S WHY IT'S

02:05:04.396 --> 02:05:05.364
NOT GONE THROUGH THE LITTLE

02:05:05.431 --> 02:05:06.332
HOOVER COMMISSION WE DON'T FEEL

02:05:06.398 --> 02:05:07.900
THAT IT IS THAT WE ARE IF WE

02:05:09.902 --> 02:05:11.337
STAFF TO ENHANCE EXISTING

02:05:11.403 --> 02:05:13.973
