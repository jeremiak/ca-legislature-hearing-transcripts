TO THAT. GOOD MORNING AND WELCOME TO ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY IT IS. MAY FIRST ALREADY. WE ARE GOING TO START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE AND NORMALLY I DO NOT LIKE TO START A SUBCOMMITTEE WITHOUT. AT LEAST REPRESENTED FROM EACH PARTY. BUT THAT DOESN'T SEEM TO BE. HAPPENING HERE. I'M GONNA TAKE THERE ARE FOR BILLS THAT ARE DEALING WITH THE CURRENT SITUATION AROUND LEAD BASED PAINT AND I'M GONNA. I'M GONNA TAKE THOSE FIRST SO THAT'S ITEM NUMBER TWO A. B.. TWENTY SEVENTY THREE ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR. ITEM NUMBER SIX AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE AND. I'VE NEVER EIGHT AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE SO WE WILL MOVE THROUGH THOSE THERE'S SOME COMMONALITY AND I WOULD LIKE TO GET THOSE. DISPENSED WITH SO WHY DON'T WE START WITH. CHOOSE BILL I REMEMBER TO AB TWENTY SEVENTY THREE. AND THEN WE'LL GO THROUGH THE REST OF THEM AND MISS IT YOU PERHAPS YOU CAN. I SOME OF THE SUB TOGETHER ALSO FOR. CERTAINLY OF THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES SO. THIS BILL IS ONE OF A PACKAGE OF BILLS TO ADDRESS A DECADES LONG ATTEMPT BY SEVERAL TOXIC LEAD PAINT COMPANIES. TO ESCAPE RESPONSIBILITY FOR POISONING GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN WITH THEIR PRODUCTS. AND BY WAY BACKGROUND FOR MANY DECADES THERE WERE A HANDFUL OF GIANT PAINT MANUFACTURERS IT SOLD TOXIC LEAD PAINT THE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS. THESE COMPANIES DID THIS KNOWING THE RISK TO HUMAN LIFE BRAIN DAMAGE KIDNEY DAMAGE INFERTILITY. REDUCED ACCUSED DISAPPEARED ABOUT MENTAL DISORDERS AND EVEN DEATH. MANY OF US HER PARENTS WE KNOW THAT CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY SUSCEPTIBLE TO LEAD POISONING THIS IT'S AN ISSUE I STARTED LEARNING ABOUT AS I WATCH MY TWO YEAR OLD SON. NOT ON OUR WINDOW SILL AT HOME. OVER THE YEARS AREN'T THESE COMPANIES MAINLY VIEWED THIS ISSUE AS A PROBLEM PARTICULAR TO LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR THERE ARE. INTERNAL COMPANY RECORDS THAT DESCRIBE THE ISSUE AS A PR PROBLEM NOT A THREAT TO PUBLIC HEALTH FOR EXAMPLE. A NINETEEN FIFTY SIX LEAD PAINT INDUSTRY MEMO DESCRIBED QUOTE A PUBLICITY PROBLEM CONCENTRATED QUOTE IN NEGRO AND PART RICAN FAMILIES. BECAUSE OF THE ACTIONS OF THESE COMPANIES CHILDREN POISONED CHILDREN WERE SPECIALLY VULNERABLE TO LEAD POISONING. IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TEN CITIES AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA. REPRESENTING MANY OF THIS JURISDICTIONS ARE THAT SIT ON THIS JUDICIARY COMMITTEE INCLUDING MY CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO. SUIT THREE PAINT COMPANIES SHORT WILLIAMS CONAGRA AND AND L. INDUSTRIES WHICH BY THE WAY STANDS FOR NATIONAL LEAD. EIGHTEEN YEARS AGO EIGHTEEN YEARS LATER. THE TRIAL COURT FOUND IN AN APPELLATE COURT AFFIRMED THAT THE TOXIC PAINT COMPANY'S NEGLIGENCE CREATED A WIDESPREAD PUBLIC NUISANCE WHICH THE COMPANIES MUST PAY TO ABATE. UNFORTUNATELY THESE THREE COMPANIES ARE STILL TRYING TO ESCAPE LIABILITY TODAY AND. WE HAVE AT THIS TIME A HALF A DOZEN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WHO'VE INTRODUCED BILLS TO ENSURE THAT THE JUDGMENT IS CARRIED OUT. THE PAINT COMPANIES ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE AND OUR NEXT GENERATION OF KIDS IS PART ARE PROTECTED FROM LEAD PAINT. MY BILL AB TWENTY SEVENTY THREE. ATTACKS HOMEOWNERS FROM POTENTIALLY FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT THE PAINT COMPANIES HAVE SUGGESTED THEY MIGHT BRING. IF A HOMEOWNER PARTICIPATES IN THE ABATEMENT PROGRAM CALLED FOR BY THE RESOLUTION OF THIS LAWSUIT. ANY POLITICIAN THERE WERE TWO SENTENCES IN A ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY THREE PAGE DECISION THAT SUGGESTED THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE TOXIC LEAD PAINT COMPANIES MIGHT SUE A HOMEOWNER. FOR MERELY PARTICIPATING IN AN ABATEMENT PROGRAM. ANY HOMEOWNER WHO DOES THE RIGHT THING REMOVES LEAD FROM HER HOME SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT THE THREAT OF A FRIVOLOUS LAWSUIT FROM A DEEP POCKETED PAINT COMPANY. AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT AS MANY HOMEOWNERS AS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATE IN THESE ABATEMENT PROGRAM TO GET LET OUT OF THEIR HOMES. OUR BILL WOULD ENCOURAGE MORE HOMEOWNERS TO PARTICIPATE HELP IMPLEMENT THE COURT'S DECISION EFFECTIVELY AND MAXIMIZE THE USE OF THE ABATEMENT PROGRAM. ARTS WITH THAT HOPEFULLY MY OUR WITNESSES ARE HERE. NEW HOGAN HOLD ON AND ESTABLISH A QUORUM. STONE HERE CUNNINGHAM CHAU. CHIU. THERE. AND ALSO FLETCHER. HOLDEN. KALRA. KILEY. MAIENSCHEIN. PRESS.

THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME ISN'T THAT BETTER CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DECLINED TO HEAR THE CASE AND NOW THERE'S A WHOLE SERIES OF ACTIONS INCLUDING INITIATIVE THAT HE REFERRED TO WHICH.

REYES I THINK YOU COLLEAGUES THAT BILLS OUT THANK YOU MISLIM OWNED PART OF NUMBER SIX AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE. THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS HAD AS YOU'VE HEARD THERE IS A PACKAGE OF BILLS RELATED TO. ADD LED HAVE AS A FORMER AND LET PREVENTION SPECIALIST FOR SANTA BARBARA COUNTY THIS IS AN IMPORTANT ISSUE AND FOR ME AS WELL. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE WOULD REMOVE A SIGNIFICANT HURDLE TO HOLD TO HOLDING PAINT MANUFACTURES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE HARM CAUSED BY THEIR PRODUCTION OF LEAD BASED PAINT. EXPOSURE TO LEAD AS YOU HEARD AND SERIOUSLY HARM THE CHILD HEALTH EVEN A SLIGHT AT YOU ELEVATION IN BLOOD LEVELS CAN REDUCE AYE Q. AND SENT DEVELOPMENT. MILLIONS OF CHILDREN'S ARE BEING EXPOSED TO LEAD IN THEIR HOMES THROUGH AGING LEAD BASED PAINT INCREASING THEIR RISK FOR DAMAGE TO THE BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM SLOWED GROWTH AND DEVELOPMENT LEARNING AND BEHAVIOR PROBLEMS HEARING AND SPEECH PROBLEMS. IN TWO THOUSAND A COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN ONE ON BEHALF OF THE PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST THREE MAJOR PAINT MANUFACTURERS THAT FOUND THAT FORMER LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS RESPONSIBLE FOR PROMOTING LEAD PAINT. A FOR USE IN HOME DESPITE KNOWING THEIR KNOWLEDGE THAT THE PRODUCT WAS HIGHLY TOXIC. AB TWENTY OH THREE WILL ENSURE THAT THOSE AFFECTED BY LEAD BASED PAINT TO ARE ABLE TO RECOVER ABATEMENT COSTS FROM LET ME PAINT MANUFACTURERS IF NECESSARY. BASED ON THE JUDGMENTS OF THE COURT THIS SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE APPROACH WITH ME TODAY IS BELLA TEAM AND THE TS HEALTH OFFICER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF SOLANO COUNTY PUBLIC HEALTH DIVISION. AND JENNY LAM A DEPUTY QUE AT COUNTY COUNCIL PERCENT OCCUR COUNTY TO SPEAK AND ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS GOOD MORNING I'M DOCTOR BELLOMONT CASH AYE ON THE. HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR SOLANO COUNTY COME YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN DEALING WITH HOW TO LEAD POISONING FOR ABOUT THIRTY YEARS AND AND AND I MUST OFFER THAT I'M I'M REALLY REALLY PLEASED TO SEE THE CALIFORNIA ASSEMBLY. ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE IN THIS WAYS TO SOMETHING THAT. THAT I THINK SPEAKS VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE'S I'M CARE FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE STATE. AT AS YOU KNOW LEAD IS DANGEROUS IN ITS TOXIC EXPOSURE TO LET US HARMFUL REALLY TO PEOPLE OF ALL AGES BUT IT IS ESPECIALLY HARMFUL TO YOUNG CHILDREN WHOSE BRAINS ARE STILL DEVELOPING. AT HIGH LEVELS IN THE BLOOD CAN CAUSE SEIZURES COMA AND DEATH HAD MODERATELY BLOOD LEVELS IT CAN DAMAGE THE NEUROLOGIC SYSTEM THE KIDNEYS THE CARDIOVASCULAR SYSTEM IN MULTIPLE OTHER ORGANS. BUT WE ALSO KNOW TODAY THAT EVEN AT THE LOW PAY THAT EVEN AT THE LOWEST LEVELS OF DETECTION IN THE BLOOD. BLOOD LEAD CAN IMPAIR LEARNING MEMORY JUDGMENT IN THINKING IT RESULTS IN LOWERED IQ IN LEARNING DISABILITIES AND DIFFICULTY WITH PROBLEM SOLVING. AND ATTENTION DISORDERS THEIR RESULTS IN GREATER STRUGGLES IN FAILURE DURING A CHILD'S PRIMARY EDUCATION IT RESULTS IN HIGHER HIGH SCHOOL FAILURE RATES. IN A REDUCED SUCCESS IN BOTH ENTERING AND SUCCEEDING IN COLLEGE. AND IN LIFELONG IMPAIRED ECONOMIC SUCCESS IN PRODUCTIVITY. IT IS IN ADDITION VERY CLEARLY AN ISSUE OF INEQUITY AS WELL AFFECTING PRIMARILY CHILDREN IN POOR COMMUNITIES. WE BECOME A WE WE HAVE BEEN AWARE FOR SOMETIME THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO LET FOR CHILDREN. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE DAMAGE DONE TO A CHILD'S BRAIN IS PERMANENT THERE IS NO TREATMENT FOR THE DAMAGE CAUSED BY LET. YOUNG CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO MANY SOURCES INCLUDING CONTAMINATED CULTURAL REMEDIES AND TREATMENTS CERTAIN CONTAMINATED CONSUMER PRODUCTS SOMETIMES TOYS. AND WHILE THESE EXPOSURES COMES ON THE HIGH LEVELS THEY ARE TYPICALLY VERY UNCOMMON. AND AND AFFECT RELATIVELY FEW CHILDREN BY FAR THE MOST COMMON SOURCE OF EXPOSURE. IS THE VERY WIDESPREAD SOURCE OF OF EXPOSURE TO LEAD IN HOUSEHOLD PAINT. FROM THE HOUSEHOLD PAINFUL TO PICK IT BECOMES INCORPORATED INTO HOUSEHOLD DUST ESPECIALLY IN AND AROUND WINDOWS AND DOORS AS WELL AS INTO THE SOIL AROUND THE HOME. AND THESE EXPOSURES SOURCES ARE PERSISTENT SINCE THE LAND ITSELF DOES NOT DETERIORATE. CHILDREN BECOME EXPOSED EFFECTIVELY THROUGH DOING NOTHING MORE THAN GROWING UP IT THROUGH THROUGH THEIR NORMAL GROWTH BEHAVIORS LIKE CRAWLING AND HOBBLING THEY COME INTO CONTACT WITH THE DUST AND THE PAINT DIRECTLY. AND THROUGH PLAYING IN THEIR HOMES AND IN THEIR YARDS THEY'RE EXPOSED TO LET. ARE IN SOLANO COUNTY WITH A POPULATION OF ABOUT FOUR NINE THIRTY THOUSAND AND ABOUT A HUNDRED FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES WE HAVE OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN FIFTY. AND SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND FOUR NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT SO THE ISSUE FOR US IS VERY VERY WIDESPREAD. A STRONG SUPPORT AB TWENTY THREE FOR THE REASONS STATED BY THE AUTHOR AND BECAUSE THIS BILL HELPS FAMILIES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PURSUE PREVENTION OF HAZARDS POSED BY LEAD. AS WELL AS MITIGATION OF THOSE HAZARDS CAUSED BY THE TO PAINT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR ANGER. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE ALTHOUGH THE BILL LARGELY COULD IF I ITS LEGAL PRINCIPLES ARTICULATED BY THE COURT OF APPEAL IN THE. VAN MARK LEAD PAINT CASE BROUGHT BY THE SENATE CLARA COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE ALONG WITH NINE OTHER CITY COUNTY. CITY AND COUNTY OFFICIALS AND IT ENSURE THIS BILL ENSURES THAT THESE IMPORTANT PRINCIPLES ARE NOT RIVERS BY FUTURE COURTS AND IT ALLOWS PLAINTIFFS TO MORE EASILY ESTABLISH THESE ELEMENTS IN FUTURE PUBLIC NUISANCE CASES. THE ONE AREA IN WHICH AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE DEPARTS FROM THE COURT'S DECISION IN OUR CASES WITH RESPECT TO CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE HOLDS THE LEAD INDUSTRY ACCOUNTABLE FOR WHAT IT SHOULD HAVE KNOWN ABOUT THE HEALTH HAZARDS CAUSED BY THEIR PRODUCT. THIS IS PARTICULARLY APPROPRIATE IN THIS CASE WHERE THAT HAS BEEN KNOWN TO BE TOXIC SINCE WELL BEFORE THE TURN OF THE TWENTIETH CENTURY. AS YOU'VE HEARD THE LEAD INDUSTRY WHAT WAS WELL WHERE FOR DECADES THAT THIS PRODUCT BECAUSE LED PETE IS LEAD POISONING IN YOUNG CHILDREN AND DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED YOUNG AND. YOUNG CHILDREN AS WELL AS POOR AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES AND THEY CONTINUE TO SELL THEIR PRODUCT FOR DECADES AFTERWARDS. AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE RECOGNIZES THE COMPANY XIN ESCAPE. RESPONSIBILITY BY BURYING THEIR HEADS IN THE SAND ABOUT THE THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN BEING POISONED BY LEAD PAINT. THE CONTRACT OF KNOWLEDGE STANDARD IS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH GENERAL TORT LAW PRINCIPLES UNDER BOTH NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY CAUSES OF ACTION LIABILITY CAN BE ESTABLISHED WITH CHEST PROOF OF. OF CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE AND UNDER NUISANCE LAWS WELL LIABILITY CAN BE ESTABLISHED THROUGH CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE SO THIS BILL IS ENTIRELY CONSISTENT WITH EXISTING TOWARD LINE WE URGE THAT YOU SUPPORTED AS WELL. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT. YOU JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE FILL OUT WE DON'T ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP THANK YOU. NICHOLAS DELUDE GET THE CITIES OF OAKLAND AND NEVER AND EMERYVILLE AND STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. PAID CALMLY WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. ATTY ON A BRIGHT LINE IN STRONG SUPPORT. MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN SANTA CLARA COUNTY BOARD SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. JACKIE STERN ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. Q. ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OPPOSITION THE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST ON CAP HE WITH MCCUE CAP CAN'T ASSOCIATES HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. A. WHILE THE APPLICATION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE LAWS TO HOMES WITH INTERIOR LEAD BASED PAINT IS CONCERNING WITHOUT QUESTION THE EXPANSION OF THAT SONG LEGAL THEORY AND THE PRECEDENT THAT TWENTY EIGHTY THREE WOULD SET. IS EVEN MORE CONCERNING A PROBLEMATIC FROM A MANUFACTURING STANDPOINT. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THE UNDERLYING CASE WAS SOLELY LIMITED TIME TO INTERIOR LEAD BASED PAINT. AND EXCLUDED EXTERIOR LEAD BASED PAINT OTHER REASON THE COURTS DID THIS OUT WAS THAT THERE WAS INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE PROVIDED. THAT ESTABLISHED HARM RELATIVE TO THE EXTERIOR BASED LEAD PAINT. AND THERE COULD BE OTHER CONTRIBUTING FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH A LEAD IN THE EXTERIOR ENVIRONMENT. WE'RE CONCERNED WITH REGARDS AB TWENTY EIGHT OVER THREE BECAUSE A GREATLY EXPANDS LIABILITY FOR PAINT MANUFACTURERS RETAILERS DISTRIBUTORS WHETHER THE PAIN WAS USED INTERNALLY EXTERNALLY OR WHETHER THERE IS ACTUAL HARM ASSOCIATED AND DETERMINED TO BE THE. RESULT OF THAT LEAD BASED PAINT IN THE HOME. THE LIT THE BILL IS APPLICABLE TO ALL HOMES FURTHER BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION INSTEAD OF THOSE PRE NINETEEN EIGHTY ONE AS ESTABLISHED IN THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION IT EXPANDS THE RISK FAR BEYOND THAT. AND THE BASIS FOR THE LIABILITY AGAINST THESE MANUFACTURERS EVEN THOUGH THE COURT DETERMINED THAT THE PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THAT TIME PERIOD. BASED ON THE FEDERAL BAN OF LEAD BASED PAINT AND THE KNOWLEDGE OF BY HOMEOWNERS OF HEALTH HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THE BILL OF A CRIME FURTHER AB TWENTY EIGHT OH THREE ARMED IT ITS EXPANSION OF PUBLIC NUISANCE LIABILITY COULD ALSO FROM A MANUFACTURING STANDPOINT HAVE A PROFOUND EFFECT ON THE BUSINESS. CLIMATE HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND. COULD SET UP CONCERNING PRECEDENT FROM A STANDPOINT OF MANUFACTURERS. AND DOWN THEIR PRODUCTS OUT BEYOND EVEN LEAD BASED PAINT IN THE FUTURE. THAT WE'RE JUST CONCERNED WITH THE ADDITIONAL NEGATIVE IMPACTS THAT TWENTY YOU KNOW THREE COULD HAVE ON THE HOMEOWNERS THEMSELVES AS WELL. BY DO YOU MEAN THEIR HOMES PUBLIC NUISANCES AS WELL AS THE LOSS OF VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THAT AS WELL. FOR THESE REASONS THAT WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE THANK YOU THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US. MORNING I MY NAME IS HEIDI MCAULIFFE FROM WITH THE AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION. ACA REPRESENTS OVER NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF THE COATINGS MANUFACTURES THE UNITED STATES AND IN CALIFORNIA. ARM WE ARE THE PAIN INDUSTRY EMPLOYS OVER THIRTY SIX THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. THEY RECEIVE AVERAGE WAGES OF ABOUT FORTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS ON THE PAYROLL FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS ABOUT ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS JUST TO GIVE YOU AN IDEA OF THE. THE BREADTH OF THE INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY MANUFACTURES ITSELF PAIN INTO THE STATE. AND FOR THE SAKE OF CLARITY I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF ACA'S MEMBERSHIP. WHILE SHARON WILLIAMS COMPANY IS A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION. AND I'LL INDUSTRIES AND CONAGRA OR NOT SHERMAN WILLIAMS IS A PAINT MANUFACTURER. CONAGRA AND NL INDUSTRIES DO NOT MAKE PAINS AND JUST TO BE CLEAR AS WELL ACA IS NOT A LITIGANT IN THE. COURT OF APPEAL AND THE CALIFORNIA VERSUS CONAGRA LAWSUIT NACA HAS NO INVOLVEMENT AT ALL WITH THE BALLOT INITIATIVE THE HEALTHY HOMES AND SCHOOLS ACT. BECAUSE THE THE BALLOT INITIATIVE IS NOT A PAIN INDUSTRY EFFORT IT ISN'T EFFORT ON BEHALF OF THOSE THREE COMPANIES. THE DECISION AND CALIFORNIA VERSUS CONAGRA IS WRONG OF AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE WHICH PROVIDES FOR EVEN EXPANDED LIABILITY BEYOND THAT. IS INAPPROPRIATE IN DEPRIVED MANUFACTURERS OF BASIC FAIRNESS. ACA AND THE CALIFORNIA PAIN COUNCIL CANNOT. RESPECTFULLY DO NOT SUPPORT TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE IS THIS BILL IMPOSES LIABILITY ON PARTIES. THAT PROMOTED LEAD BASED PAINT WITHOUT ANY DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE PRODUCT AT ISSUE IN THE PERSON MAKING THE CLAIM WE DISAGREE WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION FOR THIS VERY SAME REASON. THE DIRECT LINK BETWEEN THE CONSUMERS HARM IN THE PRODUCT THE BECAUSE THE HARM IS FUNDAMENTAL TO THOSE CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTIONS OF DUE PROCESS AND OF LIBERTY AND PROPERTY FOR ALL. IN LAYMAN'S TERMS DUE PROCESS MEANS THE FAIR TREATMENT IN THE JUDICIAL SYSTEM. OR PREVENTING ARBITRARY DENIAL OF LIFE LIBERTY OR PROPERTY BY GOVERNMENT OUTSIDE THE SANCTIONS THE LAW. ALL INDUSTRIES NOT JUST THE PAIN INDUSTRY DEPEND UPON DUE PROCESS IN ORDER TO ENSURE FAIRNESS AND SETTLEMENT OF DISPUTES. TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE IS SPECIFICALLY DESIGNED TO REMOVE THOSE STANDARDS AND PROCEDURES THAT DEMAND FAIRNESS. OF THE ANALYSIS CLEARLY STATES THIS IN SEVERAL PLACES AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE PROVIDES FOR SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED PRODUCTS LIABILITY. MUCH FARTHER THAN THAT ENVISIONED BY THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION BY INCLUDING EXTERIOR PAINT. A CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE NOT ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND NO RELIANCE ON THE ALLEGE PROMOTION. A AND IT'S UNCLEAR AS TO WHETHER THE ACT OF PROMOTION INCLUDES THE LOCAL STATE AND FEDERAL SPECIFICATIONS THAT REQUIRED THE USE OF LEAD BASED PAINT AND BUILDING. AND MAINTENANCE SPECIFICATIONS OVER THE YEARS. THE ANALYSIS ALSO STATES THAT LEAD BASED PAINT ALWAYS HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE UNSAFE IN THE FUTURE IF IT DETERIORATES. BUT ISN'T THIS TRUE OF ALMOST EVERY PRODUCT IN YOUR HOME. IF ALLOWED TO DETERIORATE CARPETING THAT ISN'T TACK DOWN TO LEAD TO FALLS IN BROKEN HIPS NATURAL GAS HEATING THAT LEAKS RESULTS IN CARBON MONOXIDE POISONING AND DEATH. MEMBER DO YOU NEED TO DROP OUT. JUST ONE LAST COMMENT THAT THERE'S BEEN DECADES OF WORK BY PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROFESSIONALS. BY EPA THE DEPARTMENT OF HUD IN THE US CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL. AB TWENTY EIGHT OF THREE COMPLETELY UNDERMINES THIS WORK OVER RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT CONFUSION. AND SEEMINGLY ENDLESS LITIGATION. WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NAY VOTE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. ADAM LIKELY ON BEHALF THE CAL CHAMBER A JUST REAL QUICK WERE OPPOSED BECAUSE THE BILL ACTUALLY GOES BEYOND THE CASE THAT'S WHY WE'RE OPPOSE. ANYONE ELSE IT UP. SEEING NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. THE ONE I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I THINK THAT DUE PROCESS QUESTIONS ULTIMATELY GET RESOLVE SINCE THEIR HEALTH WE STATE SUPREME COURT DECIDED NOT TO TAKE UP THE CASE THEY WERE SATISFIED WITH THE DUE PROCESS ISSUES AND. THAT THE CASE WAS THE COURTS ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS LIABILITY BUT IT IS INCUMBENT UPON THE LEGISLATURE TO ENSURE THAT. THAT WE ARE ASSIGNING LIABILITY IS AS WE SEE FIT WHERE IN FACT NOT BOUND BY THE COURTS AND THERE PRECEDENTS WERE CERTAINLY INSTRUCTED BY THEM. SO FOR US TO. EXPAND ON WHAT THE COURT TODAY AND ESPECIALLY WHERE WE FIND A PRODUCT TO BE QUITE SO DANGEROUS SAYS. AS LEAD PAINT IS THAT SWELLED WITHIN THE PURVIEW OF THE. LEGISLATURE TO DO SO YOU CAN BE OPPOSE FOR THAT STEP BUT THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING BEYOND THE COURT IS WELL WITHIN OUR PURVIEW AND SOME. THIS LEGISLATURE DOES ALL THE TIME SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK IT'S A IT'S A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR ALL OF US TO. UNDERTAKE AND THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION THAT IT'S THE THREE COMPANIES BRING IN THE THE BALLOT MEASURE NOT NECESSARILY ENTIRE. PAINT INDUSTRY. BUT IT'S ALSO SEEMS TO ME VERY CYNICAL. ATTEMPTS TO GET OUT FROM UNDERNEATH A LIABILITY AND AND SHIFT. TO THE PUBLIC THE RESPONSIBILITY FOR HAVING CREATED SUCH A SIGNIFICANT HARM. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I THINK THAT A NUMBER OF THE SPILLS. I'VE BEEN SPAWNED. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS MISTER KALRA I'M GONNA SAY DETERMINES SHELVES IN A SAKE NOT QUITE SO ELOQUENTLY WHAT YOU SAID BUT ESSENTIALLY HEARD THE COMMENTS YOU MADE AND THAT IS WHAT ALSO SEND IT TO A. SEGMENT OF LIMON I HAD IT'S INTERESTING WHEN YOU WANT ME TO GET HEARINGS IN AND GET TO HEAR COMMENT FROM OUR COLLEAGUES AND YOU LEARN A LOT ABOUT THEIR BACKGROUND AND SAID THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE. EXPERIENCE IN AND THAT MITIGATION AND AND HARM REDUCTION I THINK UP IS IS GREAT FOR ALL OF US. CERTAINLY FOR YOU TO BRING THAT EXPERTISE. AS A COLLEAGUE AND I THINK AS PART OF THE TEAM THAT'S BRING THE PACKETS WERE NOTHING THAT'S THE TIMING IS GOOD IN TERMS OF THE BODY SO. I PER SHAPING THE BILL FOR IT. BUT TO. THANK MISTER CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR. AND YOUR SUPPORTERS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND AND A A CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND FROM THE OPPOSITION. THAT. THAT THERE'S. THEIR NOT SUPPORTIVE OF TRYING TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT THERE'S INITIATIVE THAT COULD COMPLETELY ELIMINATE THE LIABILITY THESE THREE COMPANIES. THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE AUTHOR FEELS LIKE IT'S IMPORTANT FOR WITH THIS AND. AND I WOULD SIMPLY ASK THE OPPOSITION IF THE INITIATIVE PASSES. OF WHAT WOULD YOU HAVE US DO. JOINT HAPPY FOR C. MTA I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT PREPARED TO SPEAK TO THE INITIATIVE SEEMED HAY. IT WOULD BE HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH YOU OFFLINE SO I THINK I THINK THAT'S THE CHALLENGE AND AND WE WOULD LOVE TO HAVE A CONVERSATION WITH THE THREE COMPANIES BUT THEY'RE NOT HERE TODAY. UMP THEY'VE SENT YOU. TO REALLY REPRESENT THEIR PERSPECTIVE. SO THIS IS WHY I THINK WE HAVE WE HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT THIS ENTAILS NOW IF I UNDERSTAND. YOUR ONLY REPRESENTING ONE OF THE THREE COMPANIES BUT YOU'RE NOT ASSOCIATE YOURSELF WITH THE INITIATIVE AT THIS TIME RIGHT. THAT'S CORRECT. THAT QUESTIONS DIRECTED ME THAT'S CORRECT WE REPRESENT SHERMAN WHIMS AS A MEMBER OF THE AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION BUT WE HAVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY OTHER MEMBERS AS WELL OKAY AND AND MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT IS. YOU BELIEVE IT'S IMPORTANT HAVE ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO TO PROVE WHAT HAS BEEN AN INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THING TO PROVE IS THAT RIGHT. JOHN KEPT YOU FOR CMT I THINK THAT'S ONE PIECE OF IT AS WELL AS EXPANDED MY ABILITY TO PERHAPS I EVEN COMPANIES. AYE THAT PERHAPS ARE NOT PARTY TO THE LITIGATION NOT INVOLVED WITH LEAD BASED PAINT AS WELL SO I THINK THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT. AYE COUPLE OF ISSUES AND I IN ADDITION TO THAT. IF I COULD JUST SUBSEQUENT I'M SORRY YOU WITH THE AMERICA IT HIDING MCAULIFFE AMERICAN COATINGS ESOS OKAY* US A QUESTION WHEN YOU WERE TWO YEARS OLD. DO YOU KNOW. WHERE THE PAINT ON THE WALLS OF THE HOUSE ELEVEN WAS FROM? IT'S NOT A QUESTION I CAN ANSWER I I DON'T THINK SO DO YOU KNOW WHO THE MANUFACTURER WAS OF THE PAINT. AGAIN. IT'S NOT A QUESTION I CAN ANSWER. REPUBLICAN FIND THE RECEIPTS TO PROVE WHERE YOU BOUGHT THAT PAINT RIGHT. THAT'S THE ISSUE THAT IS WHY WE ARE HERE. BECAUSE EVERY YEAR YOU HAVE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO HAVE LEAD POISONING. YOU ADD THAT UP FOR DECADES. BILLIONS UPON BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. MILLIONS OF CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE LEAD POISONING HAVE FOUGHT THIS INDUSTRY FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS. AND YOU ARE SHIELDING THREE COMPANIES. THAT WANT TO BUY THEIR WAY. OUT OF PAIN FOR THEIR LIABILITY. IF YOU HAVE A BETTER ANSWERS ON WHAT WE CAN DO WE'RE ALL EARS BUT THIS IS OUR BEST ATTEMPT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. I RESPECTFULLY ASK WOMEN FOR THIS BILL. I THINK THAT AS A MOTION AND A SECOND BY MISTER KALRA. IF YOU OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SING THEM. IS THE ONE YOU MAY CLOSE I JUST WANT TO REITERATE THAT. AT THE WHAT'S BEEN SAID THAT THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S IMPORTANT IT'S AN ISSUE THAT HAS EXISTED I'M IN OUR STATE AND OUR COUNTIES WORKAROUND LET PREVENTION HAS HAPPENED FOR DECADES. ON INCOME AND COUNTIES IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS IS REALLY A RESPONSE I TO THE FACT THAT HOMEOWNERS MAY BE ON THE LINE FOR THIS AND I THINK THE COURTS HAVE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE ON THE LINE. AND AND. THE INITIATIVE WOULD REVERSE THAT AND I THINK THAT THAT IS PART OF OUR RESPONSE AND TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN CODIFY. THE COURTS AYE DECISION IN THIS AND THAT WE ENSURE THAT I ANY LIABILITY AND IT DOESN'T PHAM THE HOME OF CALIFORNIA DOES UPON THE FAULT OF THAT OF CALIFORNIANS. AND INSURERS THAT ON THOSE WHO HAD KNOWLEDGE ON THAT THIS WAS INDEED A TOXIC MATERIALS AND HAD ADAM OUT NEGATIVE HEALTH OUTCOMES. AYE ARE RESPONSIBLE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASPIRIN AYE BUT. THANK YOU. THE MOTION THAT WE HAVE IS DO YOU PATH KALRA PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM CHOW. CHOW I CHIU BY CHIU AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN REYES. REYES I. THE BILL IS OUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WAS CARILLO. OUR ITEM NUMBER EIGHT A. B. TO NINE NINE FIVE. WELCOME. WELL GOOD GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PERCENT AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE. A MEASURE THAT EMPOWERS HOMEOWNERS TO DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN FROM THE DEBILITATING EFFECTS OF LATE LEAD PAINT IN THEIR HOMES. WHICH YOU'VE HEARD. ON FOR. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE ON THE BILL AND I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITEES AMENDMENTS THANK YOU. CERTAIN PAINT MANUFACTURERS KNOWINGLY SOLD LEAD PAINT THAT WAS USED IN HOMES ACROSS THE STATE FOR DECADES. AND WITH THE HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF GENERATIONS OF FAMILIES. ON TOP OF THAT THE PERVASIVENESS OF LEAD PAINT IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. REVEALED THE DISTURBING PRACTICE WARPING COMPANIES CONTINUOUSLY HAVE PUT PROFITS OVER PEOPLE AND OVER THE PUBLIC SAFETY IS HEALTH. IN RESPONSE AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE DOES TWO THINGS. FIRST IT CALLS OUT THE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT FOR WHAT IT IS. A POISON THAT IS A DAMAGE TO PROPERTY AND A HEALTH HAZARD. THE MERE PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT IN OUR WALLS IS A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN BECAUSE ANY DISTURBANCE CAN FLAKE LET US INTO THE AIR. AND WE AND OUR CHILDREN WILL BE THAT. THIS MUST BE DEALT WITH EVENTUALLY AND EVERY HOME. ESPECIALLY AS PROPERTIES BUILT PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ARE REMODELED OR DEMOLISHED AND THAT CANNOT BE DONE WITHOUT DISTURBING THE LEAD PAINT UNDERNEATH ARE ON THE SURFACE OF THE WALTZ. THIS IS A GREAT HEALTH RISKS TO ALL OCCUPANTS. SECOND THE BILLS THAT THE CLEAR AND FAIR STANDARD FOR HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE ACTION. THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF STARTING THE STATUE OF LIMITATIONS TO PURSUE LEGAL ACTION AFTER SIGNING A VAGUE DISCLOSURE FORM IS UNREASONABLE. THE PRESUMPTION THAT LEADS. THE PRESUMPTION THAT LED IT FIFTH CONCERN HOMES AS A FLIMSY COP OUT THAT SEVERELY LIMITS THE TIME FRAME FROM HOMEOWNERS TO TAKE ACTION. AND IS NOT ACTUALLY BASED ON FACT OR KNOWLEDGE OF WHETHER THE LEAD ACTUALLY EXIST. TO RIGHT THIS WRONG AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE SETS THE STARTING POINT FOR TAKING ACTION TO WIN A HOMEOWNER HAS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE OF LEAD PAINT. IN THEIR HOME. AT THAT MOMENT OF DISCOVERY PROPERTY OWNERS WOULD HAVE THE MUCH DESERVED TIME AND ABILITY TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE AND PROTECT THEIR FAMILIES. THE CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL AND PREVENTION THE CDC. STATE THAT THERE IS NO LEVEL THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD IN CHILDREN'S BLOOD. ANY AMOUNT NO MATTER HOW TRACE IS TOXIC. UNFORTUNATELY THESE INJURIES ARE FELT ALL ACROSS OUR STATE FROM EUREKA TO SAN DIEGO. IN LOS ANGELES THE CDC FOUND NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE FIVE PERCENT OF CHILDREN HAVE ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS. IN SOME AREAS OF FRESNO THIRTEEN POINT SIX PERCENT OF CHILDREN TESTED HAVE ELEVATED LEAD LEVELS THAT'S NEARLY THREE TIMES THE RATE FOUND IN FLINT. MICHIGAN. DURING THE CITY'S WATER CONTAMINATION CRISIS WHICH CONTINUES TO THIS DAY. THE GRAVITY OF THIS ISSUE DEMANDS ACTION AND THIS BILL WILL ENSURE HOMEOWNERS HAVE THE LEGAL POWER TO PROTECT THAT SAFETY NOT ONLY FOR THEIR HARD EARNED PROPERTIES BUT MOST CRITICALLY. FOR THEIR FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IS JENNY LAM SANTA CLARA COUNTY COUNCIL AND BELLA MATE THAT'S A DEPUTY DIRECTOR AND. SORRY HEALTH OFFICER DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OF SOLANO COUNTY. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING CAN. THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA IS ALSO PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE. UNDER EXISTING TORT LAW NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT LIABILITY CAUSES OF ACTION ALREADY EXISTS TO HOLD CULPABLE PARTIES RESPONSIBLE FOR INJURY TO PROPERTY THIS BILL SIMPLY ESTABLISHES WHAT WE ALL ALREADY INTUITIVELY KNOW. THAT LEAD PAINT CONSTITUTES A PHYSICAL INJURY TO PROPERTY. NEARLY TWENTY YEARS AGO AT THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE FILED ITS LOOK OUT LAWSUIT AGAINST THE FORMER LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS. AND EARLY ON IN THAT CASE THE PUBLIC ENTITIES THAT WERE INVOLVED INCLUDED CLAIMS FOR NEGLIGENCE AND STRICT PRODUCTS LIABILITY BUT THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED THE DEFENDANT'S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE BASIS THAT THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS HAD RUN. ON APPEAL THE COURT OF APPEAL SUBSEQUENTLY HELD THAT THE CLAIMS HAD NOT YET A CRUDE BECAUSE WE HAD FAILED TO PLEAD THE EXISTENCE OF ANY PHYSICAL INJURY TO OUR BUILDINGS. THIS IS BECAUSE UNDER PREVAILING MUST BE PHYSICAL HARM TO PROPERTY OR PERSONS AND NOT NEAR ECONOMIC LOSS. THIS EXISTING AT CASE LAW IS SIMPLY UNACCEPTABLE. AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE IS A CRITICAL PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WILL ALLOW PROPERTY OWNERS TO SUE FOR DAMAGES TO REMEDIATE THEIR PROPERTIES BUT BEFORE FAMILIES ARE EXPOSED TO DETERIORATE LATE. DETERIORATED LEAD PAINT AND BEFORE THE ATTENDANT HEALTH HAZARDS ACCRUED TO THEIR FAMILIES. AND BY EXTENDING THE TIME IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS MAY BRING ACCLAIM AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE PROVIDES A REASONABLE TIME FRAME FOR LEAD POISONED INDIVIDUALS TO BRING CLAIMS ONCE THEY ACTUALLY HAVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE KEY INFORMATION NECESSARY TO MAKE SUCH A CLAIM. THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITH US BUT. GOOD MORNING DOT BRAILLE MY CASH HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR SOLANO COUNTY. I'M EVERDAY AND TESTIFIED ON THE HARMS OF LEAD BUT I GET ONE AT A COUPLE OF OTHER POINTS WITH RESPECT TO LEAD THAT I THINK ARE GERMANE FOR THIS BILL. IN SOLANO COUNTY AGAIN AT A MEDIUM SIZE COUNTY WE HAD AN AVERAGE OF EIGHTY FIVE CHILDREN PER YEAR OVER THE LAST THREE FOUR YEARS REPORTED WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS AND WE HAD A HUNDRED CHILDREN REPORTED AS RECENTLY AS THREE OR FOUR YEARS AGO. GIVEN THE LOAD RIGHTS OF CHILDREN WHICH WAS LOADED TO VOTE BY ONE OF YOUR MEMBERS OF THE TRUE NUMBERS OF CHILDREN IN MY COUNTY WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEVELS IS CONSIDERABLY HIGHER. AND THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT DIMINISHING IN CALIFORNIA THERE'D BEEN OVER FIFTEEN THOUSAND CHILDREN REPORTED ANNUALLY WITH ELEVATED BLOOD LEAD LEVELS OF THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS AGAIN THESE NUMBERS ARE NOT DIMINISHING. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THESE CHILDREN IN THESE FAMILIES WHO ARE NEW TO THESE HOMES ARE LIVING IN HOMES THAT WERE PAINTED WITH WITH LEADED PAINT FIFTY TWO HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO HUNDRED YEARS AGO. THEY HAVE NO KNOWLEDGE OF THE HAZARDS THAT THEY'RE MOVING INTO AND THEY DON'T HAVE THE ECONOMIC MEANS TO ADDRESS THOSE OR TO MOVE OUT OF THEIR HOMES. AND SO THE EXPOSURES ARE PERSISTENT IN THEIR ON GOING IN THE VERY VERY WIDESPREAD. GIVEN THE DAMAGE COSTS CHILDREN'S BRAINS IS PERMANENT AND THAT THERE IS NO SAFE LEVEL OF EXPOSURE TO LOOK FOR CHILD THE ONLY REASONABLE COURSE OF ACTION IS PREVENTION. AND WHEN IT WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH LET IT HOUSEHOLD PAINT PREVENTION MEANS ABATEMENT THROUGH ITS COMPLETE REMOVAL ARE COMPLETE CONTAINMENT. SO IN ESSENCE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE IS IRREVERSIBLE ADVERSE EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING ON DEFENSES CHILDREN THAT ARE COMPLETELY AVOIDABLE. SO STRONG SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE NINETY FIVE. THAT BUT AGAIN FOR THE REASONS CITED BY THE AUTHOR AND BECAUSE THIS BILL HELPS TO MUCH BETTER CLARIFY THE HAZARDS THAT ARE POSED BY LEADED PAINT AND IT ENABLES FAMILIES TO EFFECTIVELY PURSUE THE PREVENTION THOSE HAZARDS I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR DRIVER. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE IS THEIR OPPOSITION. OKAY ON A BRIGHT LINE IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. IT CALMLY WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. SO WE OUR JACKETS WITH CONSUMER ATTORNEYS IN SUPPORT. BILL ELLIOTT ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP SUPPORT. MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN SANTA CLARA COUNTY BOARDS SUPERVISOR SUPPORT. WE GO TO LOOK AT THE CITIES OF OAKLAND IN EMERYVILLE IN SUPPORT. GEN A PRICE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA LEAGUE OF CONSERVATION VOTERS IT'S PART. ART RODRIGUEZ WITH CENTRAL IMPAIRMENT ALLIANCE IN SUPPORT. I DON'T KNOW SINCE SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BROWN TO HAVE THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AND WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS OP PROPOSAL. OUR CONCERN IS WITH REGARDS TO THE. MANDATE THAT BASICALLY ANY PRESENCE OF LEAD PAINT AND A RESIDENTS IS. A DAMAGE TO THE PROPERTY AFTER EIGHTEEN OR SO YEARS OF LITIGATION THE COURT WAS EXQUISITE. IN THE UNDERLYING CASE THAT ONLY INTERIOR LEAD PAINT CREATED A HAZARD. BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T FIND EVIDENCE OF EXTERIOR PAINT CREATING THAT SAME TYPE OF HAZARD AND SO OUR CONCERN AT THIS THIS IS BROAD ENOUGH TO CAPTURE BOTH INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR PAINT DESPITE THE FINDINGS BY THE COURT AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION. THAT THAT DIDN'T CREATE HAZARDS WE HAVE CONCERNS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE WE ALSO HAVE CONCERNS WITH REGARDS TO LIMITING THIS. WITH REGARDS TO ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE INSTEAD OF THE NORMAL PREMISE OF TORT LIABILITY THAT INCLUDES CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE. AND. WE ARE CONCERNED WITH THE IMPACT THAT THAT WOULD HAVE THE DISCLOSURE IT ISSUE AS WELL THAT'S REYES WHERE IT GIVES NOTICE THAT THIS COULD INCLUDE LEAD PAINT. AND NOT NOT CREATE AN ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE IS ALSO CONCERNED. IF THAT DISCLOSURE IS MEANINGLESS THEN EXIT SIMPLY WHY DO WE HAVE IT. IF IT DOESN'T CREATE KNOWLEDGE AND SO WE ALSO HAVE A CONCERN FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AND FINALLY WITH REGARDS TO DAMAGES. ON THE UNDERLYING CASE I'D DEALT WITH ABATEMENT PUBLIC NUISANCE ABATEMENT IT'S SAID THAT SHARON'S THAT ANY OF THE LEAD PAINT IN THOSE HOMES THAT ARE DESIGNATED WILL BE UTILIZED TO REMEDIATE. THE POTENTIAL HAZARD WHEN YOU'RE DEALING WITH DAMAGES THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE DAMAGES WILL BE UTILIZED TO ABATE THE HAZARD SO WE HAVE CONCERNS FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE AS WELL FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST. THANK YOU. AS CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN DORY ABOUT THE CIVIL DISASSOCIATION CALIFORNIAN OPPOSITION. I WANT TO START BY MAKING. SURE THAT IT'S CLEAR THAT ARE THE BASIS OF OUR OPPOSITION ISN'T ABOUT THE CLEAR DANGER OF LEAD AND LEAD PAINT. WHICH WHILE ONCE WAS CONSIDERED AN INDUSTRY STANDARD AND IS IN FACT PROMOTED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR ITS PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS. A IT WE'VE NOW LEARNED THAT IT'S CLEAR ON AND DANGEROUS HEALTH EFFECTS ARE. HAVE BEEN EXPOSED SO THE ISSUE IS THAT WHEN YOU LOOK AT THESE PACKAGE OF BILLS TOGETHER MANY OF WHICH WE ARE NOT OPPOSING BECAUSE WE'RE SUPPORTIVE OF. OF. REMEDIATING. LEAD PAINT WHERE APPROPRIATE ON THE ISSUE FOR US IS THAT WHEN YOU LISTEN TO THE PROPONENTS AND YOU READ THE ANALYSIS IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS A SIMPLE EXTENSION. OF EXISTING CASE LAW BECAUSE THE FACT THAT DEFENDANTS AND EXACTLY PROVING WHO IS. RESPONSIBLE FOR DAMAGES IS NOT NEW ON IT'S BEEN GOING ON FOR MANY YEARS AND THE COURTS HAVE DEVELOPED A NUMBER OF THEORIES FOR DEALING WITH THAT. WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT THAT THE CASES OF BOTH DAMAGE AND LIABILITY ONE OF THE THINGS THAT COMES UP IS A SIN DEL VERSUS ABBOTT LABS CASE. THAT WAS THE CASE FROM WHERE WE FIRST STARTED LOOKING AT. BOTH MARKET SHARE AND RISK CONTRIBUTION THEORIES. THAT CASE INVOLVED ON THE DRUG DE YES WHICH WAS. PROVEN TO CAUSE CANCER EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PRESCRIBED TO PROVE IT TO LIMIT. AND MISCARRIAGES ON AND IN THAT CASE. THE COURT FOUND THAT THE DEFENDANTS ON MARKETED WHEN THEY KNEW OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT WAS A CARCINOGENIC SUBSTANCE AND THEY WEREN'T VIOLATIVE. OF. FDA WARNING REQUIREMENTS ON ANOTHER CASE IT'S FREQUENTLY CITED IS THOMAS SOURCES MALLET WHICH IS WISCONSIN STATES PURPOSE SUPREME COURT. IN THAT CASE THE COURT HELD THAT THE ORDER TO APPLY IN ORDER APPLY RISK CONTRIBUTION THEORY THE PLAINTIFF WOULD BE CARD SHOW THAT THAT THE LAD THIS IS A LEAD PAINT. PAINT CASE THE LEAD WAS INGESTED THE LEAD BECAUSE THE INJURIES THAT THE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCE THE TYPE OF LOVE INGESTED. AND THAT THE DEFENDANT'S CONDUCT. BREACHED A DUTY AND SO WHERE WORK CONCERN HERE IS THAT IN THESE CASES WHERE RIGHTFULLY THE COURT HAS FOUND THAT IT'S HARD TO PICK. REGULAR DEFENDANT WHO'S AT FAULT ON THEY THEY CONTINUALLY APPLY ON TWO TESTS ONE IS WAS THERE HARM AND TO WAS THERE NEGLIGENCE OR BREACH OF DUTY. AT THIS AS A BILL COUPLED WITH TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR ELIMINATE BOTH OF THOSE ON THAT'S ARE CONCERNED IT'S A BIG EXPANSION OF LIABILITY ON UP FOR A JUST CAUSE BUT THE WRONG APPROACH NOW FOR THOSE. REASONS WE RESPECTFULLY PUPS. THANK YOU ANYWHERE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. I MCAULIFFE AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU. DRAW COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION THEN WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SINGER BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. GOODNESS CARILLO I THANK YOU FOR. BRINGING THIS FORWARD THEN AND AGAIN I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR CONCERNS AND WHEN THAT. WITH THE COURTS LOOKING AT AT ITS PRECEDENT THAT. IS AWAY FOR TO DEFINE MY ABILITY BUT OF COURSE WE ARE NOT SO BAD LOANS WHEN WE'RE DEALING WITH LIABILITY QUESTIONS ESPECIALLY AROUND RISK THAT IS THE JOB OF LEGISLATURE. SHE IS WHY IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION FOR YOU TO ASK FOR US. WHICH YOU. THANK MISTER CHAIR AND. I USUALLY OPPOSITION STAYS FOR QUESTIONS BUT. I'LL JUST ASK MY QUESTIONS OUT TO THE PUBLIC. A GREAT WHERE YOU'RE COMING BACK. SO. QUESTION ARE YOUR ORGANIZATION SUPPORTING INITIATIVE. NO. TAKING A POSITION HAVE NOT TAKEN A POSITION ON THAT QUESTION ARM. SO A ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT IS RAISED BY THE PROPOSED BILL. IS AROUND ACTUAL HARM AND UP I JUST LIKE TO QUOTE AS WAS MENTIONED IN THE ANALYSIS. UP FORMER CHIEF JUSTICE. RONALD GEORGE OF FORMER REPUBLICAN CHIEF JUSTICE RONALD GEORGE ON THIS VERY ISSUE. AND WHAT HE SAID WAS WHY SHOULD A HOMEOWNER HAVE TO WAIT FOR PERSONAL INJURY TO RECOVER DAMAGES ISN'T PER FORMAL TO PAY. A RELATIVELY FEW DOLLARS AT AN EARLY DATE TO CORRECT ASSUME VIEW A SERIOUS SAFETY RISK RATHER THAN WAIT FOR DISASTER TO STRIKE IN FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY TO ASSURE. SO MY UNDERSTANDING OF YOUR POSITION IS THAT. YOU BELIEVE THERE NEEDS TO BE ACTUAL INJURY DEFINED AS CHILDREN WHO EXPERIENCE LEAD POISONING WHO'VE EXPERIENCED. SIGNIFICANT HEALTH RISKS. FOR ONE CAN MAKE THE CASE THAT THIS NEEDS TO BE ABATED IS THAT YOUR POSITION NOW THAT WAS MY POSITION OKAY WILL. THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH DETERMINING THAT LEAD PAINT ON ANY RESIDENTIAL. AREA OF ANY PRESIDENTIAL IS. DEEMED AT A PROPERTY INJURY AND OUR CONCERN WAS THAT IT THE COURT NARROWED AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION TO DO INTERIOR PAINT BECAUSE THAT IS WHERE THE CHILDREN ARE EXPOSED TO IT. AS YOU INDICATED YOUR SON WITH REGARDS THE WINDOWSILL AND THE WALLS. IF IT CHIPS OR FLAKES THE COULD INGEST IT WHEN THEY'RE AROUND ON THE ON THE FLOOR. THIS IT DOESN'T LIMIT IT TO INTERIOR PAINT WHERE THEY'VE SEEN THE HEALTH HAZARD AND IT THE EXTERIOR PAINT THEY I DIDN'T FIND ENOUGH EVIDENCE AFTER EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION TO SUGGEST THAT THAT WOULD BE A HEALTH HAZARD. AND THAT WOULD DEEM IT UP INJURY TO THE PROPERTY BECAUSE THERE IS TOO MANY EXTERIOR BY MENTAL ISSUES AND CONDITIONS THAT COULD CONTRIBUTE. ONTO THE. ISSUE OF LEAD WITH REGARDS TO OUTSIDE THE HOME OUTSIDE THE INTERIOR AND SO THAT WAS OUR POSITION IS THIS BILL DOES NOT DISTINGUISH BETWEEN INTERIOR AND EXTERIOR FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING WHEN AND IT'S A ENTRY TO THE PROPERTY. GENETIC WHAT I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES. THATCH ONE THAT WAS EXPERIENCED DURING THE EIGHTEEN LAWSUIT WAS YOU'RE RIGHT THERE IT WAS DIFFICULT TO PROVE. EXACTLY WHAT HARM CHILDREN WHO ARE INSIDE OR OUTSIDE THE HOUSE HOW THEIR AND JUST TO LET A WHICH IS EXACTLY MY UNDERSTANDING WHY THE AUTHOR WANTS TO MOVE FORWARD TO MAKE IT. A LITTLE BIT EASIER FOR UP FOR TO BE PROVEN BECAUSE WE KNOW COMMON SENSE TELLS US THAT CHILDREN WERE PLAYING RIGHT OUTSIDE HOUSES. ARE JUST AS WHEN THEY'RE ON THE INSIDE OF THE HOUSE MIGHT BE JUST AND LEAD THE ON THE OUTS ON THE OUTSIDE THE HOUSE MIGHT BE DOING THE SAME SO I THOUGHT I THINK WE WOULD MAYBE HAVE A DIFFERENCE OF OPINION ON THAT BUT BUCKLEY DISAGREED BUT YES BUT YOU'RE NOT DISPUTING. THE PORTION THIS BILL HAVING TO DO WITH ACTUAL HARM IS WHAT I ACTUALLY THOUGHT I'D HEARD FROM. FROM YOU SO SO THAT ASPECT OF THE BILL YOU'RE FINE WITH NO WE ARE JUST DISCUSSING BETWEEN TORT LIABILITY FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE I'M SORRY AND SUBJECT PLEASE. REVIEWED DON'T WANNA AND DOMINATE BUT OF THE ISSUE WITH REGARD TO CONSTRUCT KNOWLEDGE VERSUS ACTUAL KNOWLEDGE AND WHEN THAT DISCLOSURE THAT YOU'RE IN A PRE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT HOME THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CLEAN. HAVE LEAD PAINT AND IT WHETHER OR NOT THAT'S ENOUGH TO PUT YOU ON NOTICE I'M THAT YOU NEED TO INVESTIGATING CHOIR AS NORMAL TIGHTLIPPED TORT LIABILITY REQUIRES A BIT OF AN INDIVIDUAL. YET I THINK THAT THE ISSUE ABOUT HARM IS REALLY ABOUT HOW DO YOU MAKE SURE THAT KIDS ARE NOT EXPOSED TO LEAD PAINT. ON A DEMOCRATIC SENATOR DEBORAH TEASES THE ONE WHO CARRIED THE BILL THAT SAID IF YOU ACTUALLY REMEDIATE AND COVER ENCAPSULATE THE LEAD. SO THAT IT IS NOT A RISK. THAT IS HOW YOU. UP PREVENTED SO I THINK THAT THE QUESTION IS ON WANTS TO. TRY TO PUT FORTH A BILL THAT SAYS AUTOMATICALLY THE PRESENCE OF ANY LEAD IN A IN A. AND ANY ONE DROP OF LEAD IN THE HOUSE IS A HEALTH HAZARD IS AN ISSUE WHEN THERE'S LEAD IN THE SOIL THERE'S LET YOUR STRAWBERRIES THERE'S LEAD. ON IN YOUR TOYS ON THAT THAT'S WHERE WE GET ON A TO OUR DISAGREEMENTS ARE IT'S NOT ABOUT IT'S NOT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT YOU SHOULD WAIT TO HAVE KIDS. EXPOSED TO LEAD POISONING IT'S ABOUT THERE ARE MANY WAYS TO. TRY AND MITIGATE THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF LEAD AND WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT STATUTORILY MAKING IT. ANY OUNCE OF LEAD ANYWHERE IN THE HOUSE AS A THE OFFICIAL DAMAGE THAT CAN BE SUED OVER. IS THIS IS THE RIGHT REMEDY. SO AGAIN A AND I'LL ASK A QUESTION THAT I ASKED BEFORE. SO. I HANDFUL LEAD PAINT COMPANIES MADE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS SELLING PAINT WITH LEAD IN IT THAT THEY KNEW WERE GONNA HARM CHILDREN. AND ENTIRE GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN WERE HARMED AND UNDER YOUR LEGAL THEORY THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO BE HELD LIABLE. I DISAGREE WITH THAT GUIDE THE COURT UNDER THE EIGHTEEN YEARS OF LITIGATION THERE'S A BILLION DOLLAR ABATEMENT FUND AGAINST THOSE THREE COMPANIES UNDER THE THEORY PUBLIC NUISANCE TO OVERRIDE OUR ELIMINATE THE HEALTH HAZARDS. ASSOCIATED WITH INTERIOR INTERIOR PAINT USING RESIDENTIAL HOMES WHICH ALL OF THE DATA AND JOURNAL AND ALL OF THE EVIDENCE PRESENTED IN THAT CASE FOCUSED ON IT AND DIGITAL CRIBS TOYS. ALMOND WINDOWSILLS AS BEING THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF LEAD EXPOSURE FOR CHILDREN STONE IN HIS POINT YOU'RE SUPPORTING THAT COURT CASE. I'M NOT SUPPORTING THE QUIRKY SOME JUST YOUR YOUR COMMENT AS IF I APPRECIATED ASSEMBLY MEMBER WAS THAT WE'RE SUGGEST NATION TO BE HELD LIABLE AND I'M NOT SUGGESTING THAT AT ALL I'M JUST SUGGESTING THAT. THIS GOES BEYOND THAT TO INCLUDE EXTERIOR RESIDENTIAL PAINT AND LIMITS BE CONSTRUCTIVE KNOWLEDGE THAT IS UTILIZED IN NORMAL TORT LIABILITY SO OUR CHALLENGE THOUGH IS. FOR THOSE OF US WHO THINK THE COURT CASE OUGHT TO STAND WE HAVE A BALLOT INITIATIVE THAT'S ABOUT TO NEGATE IT. SO WHAT'S YOUR PERSPECTIVE ON WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN. MY PERSPECTIVE IS WELL A COUPLE OF THINGS. I'M NOT. WEHAVEN'T TAKEN A POSITION ON THE BALLOT INITIATIVE BUT I AM FAMILIAR WITH IT AND. IT PROPOSES FROM MY UNDERSTANDING PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT PROPOSES A BOND IN WHICH TO. ELIMINATE. HEALTH HAZARDS INCLUDING LEAD PAINT AND IT SUGGESTS THAT A LED PENA HOME IS NOT A PUBLIC NUISANCE IF THE VOTERS APPROVED THAT THAT'S AN INDICATION OF THE VOTERS THAT THEY DON'T AGREE WITH THE COURT CASE IN THAT THEY DON'T AGREE. THAT THEY SHOULD MOVE FOUR DOES A PUBLIC NUISANCE SO I DON'T I THINK THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD LOOK AT TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT THE VOTERS APPROVE OF THAT THEORY OR NOT AND THEN COME BACK AND DEAL WITH IT FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE. IT COULD BE THAT THE VOTERS MAY BE. DECEIVED ABOUT WHAT THIS MEASURES ABOUT THE FACT THAT IT IS ALLOWING THREE TOXIC PAINT COMPANIES TO ESCAPE THEIR BILLION ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLAR LIABILITY. WITH ONE LINE IN THAT INITIATIVE THAT ELIMINATES WHAT IT TOOK EIGHTEEN YEARS IN THE COURT TO. OVERCOME YEAH I DON'T I BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT IT DEPENDS I GUESS ON HOW THE CAMPAIGN I'M DEVELOPS OVER THE NEXT FEW MONTHS AND WHETHER OR NOT THE VOTERS UNDERSTAND UNIT I MEAN WHAT'S BEING DISCUSSED IN THAT INITIATIVE SO THAT'S WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IT'S. DETERMINAR ON THE WILL OF THE VOTERS THINK ABOUT MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AND AND JUST TO PUT ON THE RECORD A GOOD EXAMPLE OF I THINK WHAT WE'RE HEADED FOR. MY OFFICE HAS RECEIVED THE NUMBER OF LETTERS FROM CONSTITUENTS. THAT WERE ALARMED AT THIS NOTION OF THE. THE SHIFT AND AND THE CREATION OF A OF A PUBLIC NUISANCE. SO WE DUTIFULLY GOT BACK TO THEM TO FIND OUT. WHAT THEY'RE CONCERNED REALLY WAS BECAUSE THEY WERE OUTRAGED AT THE COURT DECISION ACCORDING TO THE LETTER AND YET IN EVERY SINGLE CASE? WHAT THEY TELL US IS WE WANT TO A WEBSITE? TO FIND INFORMATION. THEY DID NOT SEND THE LETTER THEY HAD NO INTENTION OF SENDING A LETTER. SO THIS IS WHY MISTER CHIU BRINGS UP THIS NOTION OF DECEPTION. ONE WHAT WE'RE FACING IS A. VERY CYNICAL POTENTIALLY WELL CLEARLY DECEPTIVE SITUATION BEING FOISTED UPON THE VOTERS OF CALIFORNIA THAT'S GOING TO SHIFT THE PAIN COMES LIABILITY ACCORDING TO THE COURT CASE. TO THE PUBLIC AND IF THAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN AND THE AND THE COURTS ARE GOING TO MAKE FOR THAT THE PEOPLE CALIFORNIA ARE GOING TO. BUY THAT LINE AND MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION THEN THE SETS OF BILLS ARE IN FACT CHANGING THE CALCULATION OF LIABILITY TO ENSURE THAT WE STILL CAN HOLD THOSE WHO ARE HAVE CAUSED TO HARM KNOWINGLY CAUSE THE HARM. ACCOUNTABLE THAT'S THAT'S THE. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM. MEMBERS. ALRIGHT SINGGAH IN THIS CAREER YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU CLEARLY BE THE CONVERSATION AT HAND SHOWS US. THAT THERE IS MUCH TO BE DONE. WHEN THE WITH REGARDS TO LET PAIN AND HOMES I BELIEVE THAT. PROTECTING THE AMERICAN DREAM OF HOMEOWNERSHIP IS ABOUT PROTECTING THE HARD WORKING FAMILIES THAT WANT THE DREAM TO BE A REALITY. AND WANT THEIR FAMILIES AND THEIR CHILDREN TO BE SAFE THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT ABOUT PROTECTING THE CORPORATIONS TO ENSURE THAT THEY ARE NOT LIABLE FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF KNOWINGLY SELLING. LEAD PAINT THAT HAS HOT HAD. INCREDIBLE. ISSUES ON HEALTH WHICH CHILDREN AND WITH FAMILIES ACROSS OUR STATE THIS IS ABOUT THE VALUES OF OUR STATE THIS IS ABOUT HOW WE PROTECT FAMILIES THAT WE PROTECT CHILDREN. AND HOW WE ENSURE THAT WE ARE HOLDING CORPORATIONS ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE DAMAGE THAT THEY HAVE DONE. AND SO RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU OF SILICON FOR MOTION THE MOTION IS TO PASS SECOND AMENDED. WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY HIS ARREST IN THE SECOND BY MISTER TO. CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM NO CHAU. CHAO AYE CHU AYE CHIU AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER. GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN. REYES. REYES I. THAT BILLS OUT. THANK YOU. RIGHT. SO I SEE MISTER BONTA HERE. WE HAVE MISSED BUT YOU HAVE TO BILLS WE'RE DOING THAT THE LEAD BILLS TOGETHER. WE'VE TAKEN THESE AS AS A BLOC AT WHICH IS A LITTLE. OUT OF ORDINARY BUT I SAW MISTER LEVINE HERE SO WHAT I'M WHEN ASKED ABOUT HIS IF YOU PRESENT YOUR LEAD PAINT BILL THAT WE CAN LET MISTER LEVINE GO SINCE HE'S BEEN VERY PATIENT. AND THAT AND THEN DO YOUR SECOND BELL IF YOU DO THAT THEN I THINK WE. TRY TO RESPECT THE FOLKS WHO WERE OR ATTEMPTED DECIDED TO MANAGE THEIR WAY THROUGH OUR COMMITTEE. SO WE'LL TAKE ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWO OH SEVEN FOR. AND THAT WILL. EMPLEADO FOR LESS PAY BILLS OF THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT MORNING STAFF THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR TODAY I KNOW YOU'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT PAIN AND. THIS DIFFERENT POLICY APPROACHES TO ALLOW FOR THOSE THAT HURT BY LEAD PAINT TO ACHIEVE JUSTICE. ACCORDING TO THE FEDERAL CENTER FOR DISEASE CONTROL PREVENTION LEAD PAINT IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF CHILDHOOD. LEAD POISONING AND TOO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN PERMANENTLY HARMED. BY EXPOSURE. TO LEAD THE CDC THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION AND THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS ALL AGREE THAT THERE IS NO. KNOWN LEVEL OF LEAD THAT'S SAFE ANY AMOUNT OF LEAD HURTS OUR CHILDREN. FOR TOO LONG PIC COMPANIES HAVE AVOIDED RESPONSIBILITY FOR PRODUCING SELLING. ST DISTRIBUTING LEAD BASED PAINT INNOCENT VICTIMS OF LEAD POISONING FACE LONG ODDS IN TRYING TO SEEK JUSTICE. EVEN THOUGH THEY ARE CLEARLY HARMED BY A LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURER CURRENTLY EVEN WHEN IT IS CLEAR. THAT MOST WOMEN YOU FACTORS PROVIDED AN DISTRIBUTED WEBSITE PRODUCED AND DISTRIBUTED THE PAINT THAT CAUSED THE INJURY VICTIMS MUST PROVE THE EXACT MANUFACTURER. WHOSE LEAD PAINT THEY INGESTED BUT WITH THE PASSAGE OF TIME THE LOSS OF RECORDS. THAT. THE PAINT COMPANIES OFTEN CONTROL AND THE NUMBER OF MANUFACTURERS IT IS VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO OVERCOME. THIS BURDEN OF PROOF LEAVING TENS OF THOUSANDS OF INNOCENT POISONED CHILDREN WITHOUT COMPENSATION. FOR THEIR INJURIES AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR WILL HELP CHILDREN AND PARENTS STEVE JUSTICE FOR THE PERMANENT DAMAGE INFLICTED ON THEM. AND WILL HELP THEM RECEIVE THE CARE SPECIAL SERVICES THEY NEED AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR WILL CREATE A MORE FAIR. LEGAL PATHWAY FOR ANYONE HURT BY LEAD PAINT. IT JUST THIS BY ADOPTING WHAT'S KNOWN AS A RISK CONTRIBUTION AND IT'S RELATED TO OTHER SIMILAR THEORIES IN THE LAW. AND IN THE MASS TORT CONTEXT THIS MODEL ALLOWS THE PLAINTIFF TO MAKE INITIAL SHOWING. OF HARM AND CAUSATION AND SHIFT THE BURDEN TO LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS TO SHOW THAT THEY WERE NOT. RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INJURY. THIS IS NOT ONLY FAIR BUT THE LEAST WE CAN DO. FOR OUR CHILDREN. WITH ME HERE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT ISABEL ALLEY ARE TO ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP I HAVE ALSO HAVE GINNI LAMP DEBBIE CAN'T COUNTY COUNCIL FOR THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA. AND OFFER TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE SHOULD BE NEEDED I HAVE AYE JAMIE HULING DELAY DEPUTY CITY ATTORNEY OF THE SENSES CHO CITY ATTORNEYS. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE GOOD MORNING TONY LAM CAN FROM THE COUNTY OF SANTA CLARA WHICH IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOR THIS BILL BUILDS ON THE FACTS ESTABLISHED IN THE LAWSUIT THAT YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT THIS MORNING. AND IT'S ALREADY WELL ESTABLISHED THE EGREGIOUS CONDUCT THAT THE LEAD INDUSTRY ENGAGED IN AS WELL IS THE HARDEST TO CHILDREN. AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR HELPS TO ADDRESS THAT. THAT COSTS HAD TO THE VICTIMS OF LEAD POISONING BY ALLOWING THEM TO MORE EASILY ESTABLISH AT THAT THAT. PRODUCER SELLERS TO SHOOTERS AND PROMOTERS BECAUSE THEIR INJURIES AND THEREFORE TRUCK TEEN DAMAGES FOR THEIR INJURIES AS WITH ALTERNATIVE MARKET SHARE LIABILITY. AND ALTERNATIVE LIABILITY THEORIES GENERALLY AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR RECOGNIZES THAT WHEN YOU HAVE INNOCENT VICTIMS WHO THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. HAVE DIFFICULTY IDENTIFYING THE SPECIFIC ENTITY THAT BECAUSE THERE HARM. AND WHEN YOU HAVE DEFENDANTS WHO UNQUESTIONABLY ENGAGED IN TORTIOUS CONDUCT THAT IT IS ENTIRELY APPROPRIATE TO SHIP PART OF THE BURDEN OF PROOF TO THE DEFENDANT'S. A. AB AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR. ALSO RECOGNIZES THAT VIS A VIS INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS THE LEAD INDUSTRY IS IN A SUPERIOR POSITION TO KNOW AND PRODUCE EVIDENCE ABOUT WHERE THEY MANUFACTURED DISTRIBUTED SOLD AND PROMOTED THEIR PRODUCTS. THEY ARE IN A BETTER POSITION TO ABSORB THE COSTS OF THE LEAD POISONING THAT THE CHILDREN HAVE SUFFERED AND THEY CAN AND HAVE INSURE THEMSELVES AGAINST LIABILITY FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. BUT AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR DOES NOT ELIMINATE THE CAUSATION REQUIREMENT IN THESE CASES IT STILL REQUIRES A PLAINTIFF TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF THE PRESENCE OF A PARTICULAR TYPE OF LEAD PAINT PIGMENT AT A PARTICULAR EXPOSURE LOCATION. IT STILL REQUIRES A PART OF PLAINTIFFS TO PROVE THE EXISTENCE OF ESTABLISH SPECIFIC PATHWAY BY WHICH LEAD PAINT PIGMENT WITH ACTUALLY INTERESTED. AND IT STILL REQUIRES A PLAINTIFF TO PROVE THE CAUSAL LINK BETWEEN THE INJECTION OF A LEVEL LEAD PAINT PIGMENT ANTS THE ASSERTED ENTRY. AND A DEFENDANT CAN STILL PROVE THAT IT DID NOT PRODUCE SELL DISTRIBUTE OR PROMOTE THAT LEAD PAINT PIGMENT IN THE RELEVANT GEOGRAPHIC MARKET OR TIME PERIOD. SO NOW AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR DOES NOT ESTABLISH A SLAM DUNK CASE OF ABSOLUTE LIABILITY. IN FACT THE FIRST AND ONLY CASE TO GO TO TRIAL UNDER THE RISK CONTRIBUTION THEORY IN WISCONSIN FOUND THAT THE PLAINTIFF FAILED TO PROVE THAT HIS INJURY WAS ACTUALLY CAUSED BY THE INGESTION OF LEAD PAINT. NO IT IS AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR MAKE EVERY INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURE THE INSURER OF EVERY OTHER MANUFACTURER. WHAT IT DOES DO IS TO ALLOW PLAINTIFFS TO ACTUALLY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THEIR CASES IN COURT AND TO SEEK REDRESS FOR THE CREATURES HOMES THAT HAVE BEEN DONE TO THEM BY THE LEAD INDUSTRY? THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE ALLOW LEO ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THE HAZARDS OF LEAD BOTH IN THIS BILL PACKAGE IN OTHER BILLS IN THE ASSEMBLY. AND THE SENATE. I WANTED TO POINT OUT THE KIDS NOT ONLY LICK WALLS THEY EAT DIRT. AND THEY GET LEAD PAINT CHIPS IN THEM THAT WAY THAT OF LOVE UPON BY THE SIDE OF THE HOUSE SO. THERE'S MULTIPLE AVENUES OUT WE THINK THIS BILL ISN'T SCAPEGOATING ANY PARTICULAR MANUFACTURING WHEN IT IS MORE FAIRLY ALLOCATING THE LIABILITY. AS THE. REPRESENTED FROM SANTA CLARA COUNTY STATED OF SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. CENTRALIZES RIGHT RODRIGUEZ OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY EMPOWERMENT ALLIANCE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE. GOOD MORNING LIANE TREND FOR CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. NICCOLO DELUDE OF THE CITIES OF OAKLAND IN EMERYVILLE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ATTY ON A BRIGHT LINE IS ALSO WORTH MENTIONING BRIGHT LINES COMMUNITY PARTNERS CAN YOU CENTER A PHILIP RANDOLPH INSTITUTE OF SAN FRANCISCO AND STRONG SUPPORT. MICHAEL RIGHT AGAIN AND WE HAVE THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS SANTA CLARA COUNTY IN SUPPORT. ECONOMY THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS IN SUPPORT. IF YOU WANT TO PLACE IN THE CALIFORNIANS FOR. THANK YOU WILL KNOW WHAT OTHER SUPPORTER FROM THE AUDIENCE. OPPOSITION PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JENNIFER BRAGGING ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ARE OPPOSED AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS AND. HEARING THE PACKAGE OF DISCUSSION OF BILLS ABOUT WANTING TO HOLD MANUFACTURERS OF LEAD PAINT. COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR THE EXPOSURE AND THE HAZARD AND HEALTH RISK THAT THE OF COSTS THEIR CHILDREN BUT THIS BILL GOES WAY BEYOND THAT. IT TOUCHES ANY COMPANY WHO AS ANY PART IN THE STREAM OF COMMERCE WITH REGARDS TO LEAD PIGMENT NOT LEAD BASED PAY LEAD BASED PAINT. NOT LEAD BASED PAINT THAT IS UTILIZED IN INTERIOR HOMES OR EVEN AT HOMES AT ALL IT GOES AFTER EVERY COMPANY IN THAT STREAM CONGRESS WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAD. KNOWLEDGE OF ANY HEALTH HAZARDS WHETHER OR NOTTHEY ACTUALLY. PROMOTED MARKETED OR DISTRIBUTED LED PIGMENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR PURPOSES OF LEAD BASED PAINT WHETHER OR NOT THEY ACTUALLY CAUSED THE INJURY. ASSOCIATED WITH ANY HEALTH HAZARDS. ASSOCIATED WITH A CHILD OR ANY INDIVIDUAL WITH REGARDS TO EXPOSURE TO LEAD BASED PAINT WE HAVE A HUGE CONCERN OF THE FACT THAT IT UNDERMINES THE WHOLE EXISTENCE OF TORT LIABILITY AND HOLDING IN THE COMPANY. UP RESPONSIBLE A PRODUCT THAT THEY HAVE CREATED AND THE INJURIES THAT THAT PRODUCT HAS COST AND IF WE CAN GO THROUGH I CAN TOUCH ON HOW WE READ THE BILL AND HOW WE READ HOW BROAD THE EXPOSURE IS UP FOR LIABILITY IN THIS BILL. IT'S BEYOND THE RISK MAP A LIABILITY DOCTRINE THAT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS IT'S BEYOND MARKET SHARE LIABILITY THAT'S DISCUSSED IN THE ANALYSIS I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY. AYE REFERENCE TO ANY PROPOSAL OF SUCH EXTREME TORT LIABILITY AS PROPOSED IN AB TWENTY SEVENTY FOUR SO IF YOU LOOK AT THE FIRST PROVISION OF THE BILL. IT SAYS THAT ANY DISTRIBUTOR MANUFACTURER OR ANYBODY WHO PROMOTED THE TYPE OF LEAD PIGMENT THAT CAUSE THE INJURY THAT'S THE BURDEN OF PROOF THAT THE PLANE PASSED TO ESTABLISH. IT'S NOT LIMITED TO CALIFORNIA SO UNDER THE PROPOSAL A BILL IT DOESN'T SPECIFY THAT YOU HAD TO HAVE IT MANUFACTURED SOLD DISTRIBUTED OR PROMOTED BY PIGMENT IN CALIFORNIA. IN ORDER FOR THEM TO SATISFY THEIR BURDEN WHICH WAS ONE OF THE KEY ROVISIONS ARE KEY ISSUES IN THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO SHOW THAT IT WAS THE ACTUAL LEAD PAINT PIGMENT. THAT WAS DISTRIBUTED MANUFACTURED OR PROMOTED IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAUSED THE INJURY. YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY SHOW THAT YOU MANUFACTURED DISTRIBUTED OR PROMOTED LED PIGMENT FOR PURPOSES AB IN LEAD BASED PAINT INSIDE A HOME. THERE'S ACTUALLY LED PIGMENT WAS UTILIZED FOR A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT REASONS CERAMICS OPINION ON SHIPS OPINION ON BRIDGES THERE IS NO INDICATION THAT ALL LEAD PIGMENT WAS UTILIZED IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSE OF LEAD BASED PAINT ON HOMES. SO WE HAVE A HUGE CONCERN THAT SOMEBODY CAN BE HELD LIABLE UNDER THIS THEORY OF LIABILITY EVEN THOUGH THEY NEVER PRODUCE THE PRODUCT THAT IS AT ISSUE WITH REGARDS TO EXPOSURE TO CHILDREN AND THE HEALTH HAZARDS IT'S CREATED. THERE AND AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE LITIGATION FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS THAT CASE WAS LITIGATED COMPANIES WERE DISMISSED BECAUSE THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT AGAIN THEY NEVER DISTRIBUTED PROMOTED OR MARKETED LED PIGMENT FOR PURPOSES OF LEAD PAINT A RESIDENTIAL HOMES AND SO THE COURT DISMISSED THEM. BOTH COMPANIES UNDER THE THEORY OF LIABILITY WOULD NOW BE BROUGHT BACK IN. ONCE THE PLAINTIFF ESTABLISHES THAT BURDEN OF PROOF WHICH WE% SEE AS AS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. THE BURDEN IS NOW ON THE DEFENDANT TO PROVE A NEGATIVE. THEY HAVE TO PROVE THAT THEY DID IT DISTRIBUTE MANUFACTURER PROMOTE. LED PIGMENTS AND DURING THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD OR THE GEOGRAPHICAL AREA NEITHER ONE OF THOSE RACES OF WHICH ARE DIFFERENT. PROVING A NEGATIVE IS ABOUT CHALLENGING I WOULD SAY IF NOT IMPOSSIBLE I WILL UTILIZE ONE OF THE REPRESENTATIVES FROM THE COMPANIES INVOLVED IN THIS WHO HAVE SAID. WE. A COMPANY THAT I WILL SAY IT WAS NOT AYE INVOLVED IN THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION BUT AS SAID WE OFTEN A KEEP RECORDS OF THINGS THAT WE DO DO WE DON'T KEEP RECORDS OF THINGS THAT WE DON'T DO AND SO PROVING A NEGATIVE IS A HUGE CHALLENGE. BUT LET'S GO EVEN BUT BEYOND THAT. UNDER THIS BILL AGAIN GET LET'S TALK ABOUT A COMPANY THAT DISTRIBUTED LED PIGMENT IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE PURPOSES OF CERAMICS SO THAT SATISFIED THEIR BURDEN OF PROOF AND THEN IT GOES ON TO THEIR AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSE. THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO SHOW NECESSARILY BUT THEY DIDN'T DISTRIBUTE OR MARKET LED PIGMENT IN CALIFORNIA. AND A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHICAL AREA DURING THE RELEVANT TIME PERIOD EVEN THOUGH THEY COULD SHOW IT WAS NEVER UTILIZED FOR THAT THE PACE IT WOULD STILL BE LIABLE. FOR ALL INJURIES ASSOCIATED WITH LEAD PICNIC CALIFORNIA HUNDRED PERCENT MY ABILITY AND THAT'S WHERE THE MARKET CHAIR LIABILITY IN THE RISK BY A BILL THE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THIS IS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY. MEANING IF YOU ARE EVEN ONE PERCENT ON THE HOOK YOU ARE A HUNDRED PERCENT LIABLE FOR ALL INJURIES IT'S NOT ASSOCIATED IT'S NOT ALLOCATED AMONGST THE DIFFERENT COMPANIES. WHO MANUFACTURED THE LIMPING IT'S A ALLOCATED TO YOU ONE HUNDRED PERCENT ON THE HOOK AND THESE ARE INDEED ENTITIES I WANT TO SAY? OTHER WERE BROUGHT UP IN THE UNDERLYING LITIGATION WHO AGAIN HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH CREATING THE PRODUCT LA TIMES LA TIMES PROMOTED THE USE OF LEAD BASED PAINT. BACK WHEN IT WAS UTILIZED IN THE STATE AND I THOUGHT THAT WAS APPROPRIATE FOR HEALTH REASONS OAKLAND TRIBUNE THEY OFFER UP PROMOTED MARKETED LEAD BASED PAINT AS WELL SO BE IT UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. WILL BE A HUNDRED PERCENT ON THE HOOK FOR THAT. HARM CREATED IN THESE HOMES FOR LEAD BASED PAINT EVEN THOUGH THEY NEVER CREATED A PRODUCT SO AGAIN OUR CONCERN IS THIS GOES WELL BEYOND JUST HOLDING THE COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE THAT CREATED LEAD BASED PAINT FOR INTERIOR USE OR EVEN ON THE RESIDENTIAL USE. AND HOLDS ANYBODY LIABLE IN THE STREAM OF COMMERCE EVEN THOUGH THEY WANT TO CREATE THE PRODUCT IT DIDN'T CAUSE ME HARM DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING ASSOCIATED WITH LEAD BASED PAINT FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE MISTER MEMBERS SAID JOHN DORY ON BEHALF OF THE CIVIL JUSTICE AFICIONADOS VISION I WOULD JUST ADD TO. MISS BARROWS ELOQUENT THAT TESTIMONY OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE LIABLE UNDER THIS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR PROMOTING AND WE'RE RECOMMENDING LEAD PAINT. DURING A TIME WHEN PEOPLE WERE. IMPRESSED BY ITS ABILITIES TO HELP SPREAD OUT TO STOP THE SPREAD OF A CONTAGIOUS DISEASES. ON I THINK THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES ON THAT THAT WE ARE MOST CONCERNED ABOUT IS THE WAY THAT LIABILITY WORKS I'VE HEARD A LOT OF COMMENTS. ABOUT HOW ON PINK COMPANIES ON THAT KNOWINGLY A DISTRIBUTED DANGEROUS PRODUCTS ARE TRYING TO ESCAPE THEIR. RESPONSIBILITIES HERE AND THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT THEIR THEIR THEORIES OF LIABILITY UNDER WHICH YOU CAN. YOU KNOW GO AFTER THOSE. INDIVIDUALS IF THAT IS TRUE AND IN FACT THE ONE OF THE. THE GROUND BREAKING CASES ARE A TALK ABOUT INSTANT DEL VERSUS ABBOTT LABORATORIES IT WAS A DRUG CASE. BUT IT'S THE EXACT SAME ALLEGATIONS THAT THERE WAS A DRUG MANUFACTURERS WHO KNEW THAT THE PRODUCT WAS DANGEROUS THEY WERE WORN BY THE FDA ABOUT IT AND THEY CONTINUE TO MARKET IN ORDER TO MAKE A PROFIT. THAT THERE WAS NO NEED TO IN THAT CASE TO SHOW THAT IT INDIVIDUAL MANUFACTURER WAS THE ONE. ON THE OTHER THING THAT WE NEED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT IS THE WAY JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITY WORKS WHICH IS YOU DON'T HAVE TO ACTUALLY FIND THE PERSON WHO ENGAGED IN THE TYPE OF CONDUCT THAT'S BEING ALLEGED HERE TODAY. YOU JUST NEED TO FIND ANYBODY WHO WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THAT IF I'M IF I WAS A A TRUCKING COMPANY AND I WAS DELIVERING PAINT. ON. AT FOR ON BEHALF OF THE MANUFACTURE NOT ONLY MY LIABLE UNDER THIS BILL I'M LIABLE FOR ALL OF THE DAMAGE. I'M SO IF THE IF THE IF THE CONCERN IS THAT THERE IS AN INDUSTRY THAT IS ESCAPING LIABILITY. FOR. YOU KNOW CONDUCT THAT IS. INTENTIONAL OR NEGLIGENT. YOU WOULD HAVE A DIFFERENT BILL IN FRONT. OF THIS IS THE BILL. THAT MAKES ANYBODY ASSOCIATED WITH THAT REGARDLESS OF WRONGDOING A NEGLIGENT THAT'S THE WAY JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITY WORKS IT PUTS ONE DEFENDANT ARM ON THE HOOK FOR ALL OF THE DAMAGES AND SO THOSE ARE CONCERNS. AND WE WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A NOVA. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. JUST GIVE US YOUR NAME AND YOUR AFFILIATION PLEASE. HEIDI MCAULIFFE AMERICAN COATINGS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. AFTER ALL CUT CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SEE NONE OF BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. KILEY. I JUST FOR THE AUTHOR OR ANY OF THE PROPONENTS I'M. I'M STRUGGLING UNDERSTAND THE HOW YOU CAN HAVE. RISK CONTRIBUTION OUR MARKET SHARE LIABILITY WHICH IS KIND OF A NOVEL ENOUGH AYE THEORY IS IT ISN'T AND COMBINE THAT. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY HOW THOSE EVEN GO TOGETHER IN A COHERENT THEORY OF LIABILITY Y. HAS JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITY APPROPRIATE HERE. JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY IS NOT A NEW CONCEPT ENDS IN THE ANALYSIS FOR THE SPELL AND THE COUNSEL FOR THE COMMITTEE NOTED. THAT WISCONSIN ALREADY HAS RISK CONTRIBUTION THEORY APPLIED IN THAT STATE AND JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ALSO APPLIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH RISK CONTRIBUTION THERE. AND I WILL SAY THAT JOINED SEVERAL LIABILITY DOES NOT MEAN THAT A SINGLE DEFENDANT SUDDENLY BECOMES LIABLE FOR THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. IN OUR LAWSUIT THAT YOU'VE HEARD SO MUCH ABOUT JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY ALSO APPLIED WITH RESPECT TO THE DEFENDANT'S UNDER AYE PUB PUBLIC NUISANCE THEORY. AND DEFENDANTS WERE UNDER EXISTING CASE LAW DEFENDANTS COULD PRESENT INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR SHARE OF THE LIABILITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW THE COURT TO APPORTION LIABILITY AMONG THE DEFENDANTS THEY PRESENTED NO EVIDENCE THEY CHOSE NOT TO PRESENT ANY EVIDENCE. IN ORDER TO APPORTION THE LIABILITY AMONGST THEMSELVES AND SO THEN THEY ENDED UP JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE. I THINK IT IS ANYONE IN THE OPPOSITION HAVE ANY. YOU KNOW. THE COMMENTS ON HOW THEIR THEORY OF LIABILITY HERE DESERVE DIFFERS FROM WE'VE SEEN IN THE PAST YEAH I THINK THAT THERE'S TWO THINGS THAT I THINK THAT YOU MADE A GOOD POINT WHICH IS PUTTING THEM TOGETHER IS WHAT THE ISSUE IS. ONE ARM ADD TO THE POINT AT HAND ON WHEN YOU HAVE NAMED DEFENDANTS THAT ARE ALL BEING SUED TOGETHER THAT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO THAT. THE PROBLEM WITH JOINED SEVERAL IS THERE'S NUMBER OF DEFENDANTS WHO ARE NOT AT THE TABLE WHO MAY BE BANKRUPT OUT OF BUSINESS OR NOT SUIT OR OR FOUND SAID SAID THAT CONCERN. JUST. JUST. APPORTIONED AMONG THE NAMED DEFENDANTS DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM THE OTHER THING I'D SAY TO THE WISCONSIN AND THE INCIDENT THAT IS TRUE WHAT WAS SAID. BUT IN FACT THAT THE. STILL REQUIRES DAMAGES AND A BREACH OF DUTY WHICH THESE TWO CASES ELIMINATES WHEN YOU PUT IT ALL TOGETHER. IT'S A IT'S A LIABILITY STORE. IF I JUST MAY FOLLOW UP ON THAT EVEN FURTHER MY UNDERSTANDING IS WITH REGARDS THE WISCONSIN CASE THAT AFTER THAT CASE COME OUT THE LEGISLATURE THE FOLLOWING YEAR PASSED LEGISLATION THAT SAID WE'RE NOT GOING TO UTILIZE MARKET SHARE LIABILITY OR RISK BY BUILDING A LONGER. AND WITH REGARDS TO THAT CASE SPECIFICALLY AGAIN IT WAS THE MANUFACTURERS OF THE ACTUAL PRODUCT THAT WERE INVOLVED NOT ANYBODY WHO TOUCHED AN INSTRUMENT COMMERCE NOT ANYBODY WHO MAY HAVE BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACTUAL MANUFACTURES THE PROJECT IN SOMETHING THAT WAS BROUGHT UP EARLIER BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER. THE INABILITY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONE UMPS WOULD WHOSE PRODUCT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE HOME AT THE TIME THEY IT LIMITED TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS SPECIFICALLY. NOT ANYBODY AGAIN AND THE STREAM OF COMMERCE AND SO THIS BILL GOES FAR BEYOND THAT I'M AND HOLDS ANYBODY WHO'S ASSOCIATED WITH THAT REGARDLESS OF WHETHER CAN THEY ACTUALLY MADE THE PRODUCT. IF YOU AND YOUR QUESTIONS COMMENTS. SEEING NONE STILL LOOKING FOR A MOTION THE MOTION WOULD BE TO PASS A MAKE A MAKE A MOTION AND AND JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS I THINK. ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT MANY OF US ARE GRAPPLING WITH IS HAS TO DO WITH THE QUESTION I ASKED A LITTLE EARLIER WHICH IS. HOW MANY OF US CAN ACTUALLY REMEMBER? WHAT PAINT WAS ON THE WALLS OF OUR HOMES WHEN WE WERE LITTLE KIDS AND IF IT TURNED OUT THAT WE? BECAME POISONED BECAUSE A LEAD PAINT AND OUR BROTHERS AND SISTERS WERE POISONED AND TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN. ARE POISONED AND I CAN'T TELL YOU WHETHER THE PAIN TO MY WALLS FROM SHERWIN WILLIAMS. OR CONAGRA OR. NATIONAL LEAD INDUSTRIES AND THEY FIGHT THIS FOR EIGHTEEN YEARS AN ACCORD WHOLESOME LIABLE AND THEN THEY DECIDE TO GO TO THE BALLOT. AND POTENTIALLY WITH A VOTE IN NOVEMBER THEIR LIABILITY WOULD GO AWAY. THE QUESTION TO YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE NOW THE FACE OF THE OPPOSITION HERE IS WHAT ARE WE THIS AYE IT'S A IT'S A RHETORICAL QUESTION BECAUSE. I ASSUME. YOU HAVE AN ANSWER THAT SUGGESTS THAT INDUSTRY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO PAY FOR THIS. IF YOU HAVE A DIFFERENT ANSWER. HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD PAY IF THEY SHOULD PAY THEIR ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS? THAT'S A DIFFERENT THING BUT MY GUESS IS THAT'S NOT YOUR PERSPECTIVE. OF BUT AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE THAT'S REALLY WHAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GRAPPLE WITH HERE. SO YOU HAVE. AGAIN I JUST REITERATE WE HAVE NO POSITION ON THE BALLOT WE HAVEN'T SUPPORTED THAT AND WE HAVE NO POSITION ON THE UNDERLYING CASE AND SO AGAIN AT THAT CASE STANDS IN THEIR PAIN THE ONE BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE THE COURT FOUND THAT THEY MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCT. THAT HARM THESE INDIVIDUALS SHOULD THAT'S CREEK CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY SPOKEN THEY'VE YEAH BUT IMPORTS SYSTEM HAS SAID. THEY ARE LIABLE FOR ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS NOW THEY'RE GOING TO THE PUBLIC. I'M TRYING TO DECEIVE THE PUBLIC ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING THROUGH DECEPTIVE ADVERTISING BY SENDING. LEGISLATORS OFFICES HUNDREDS OF EMAILS. AND AND A AND PUSHING FORTH MESSAGES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY. PLEASE THE DECEPTIVELY FALSE SO I'D AYE DON'T IT I'M NOT GOING TO DISPUTE THAT I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THOSE EMAILS OR ANYTHING THAT'S GOING ON AGAIN WERE NOT INVOLVED IN THE CAMPAIGN ON THE INITIATIVE BUT HERE. AGAIN I DON'T THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HOLD ANY COMPANY LIABLE FOR THE HARM THAT WAS CREATED BY A DIFFERENT COMPANY THAT CREATED THE PRODUCT SO NO LIABILITY KNOWN FOR THE COMPANIES THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT YET NO LIABILITY I DON'T THINK THAT THEY. ANYONE WHO'S THAT. MARKETED OR PROMOTED LED PIGMENT FOR CERAMICS SHOULD BE WITHHELD ONE HUNDRED PERCENT LIABLE FOR LEAD PAINT THAT WAS UTILIZED INSIDE A HOME AN EXPOSE CHILDREN TO LEAD POISON I DON'T THINK THAT'S A FAIR DUE PROCESS ANALYSIS. IF YOU HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THE PRODUCT THAT YOU SHOULD SOMEHOW NOW BE HUNDRED PERCENT ON THE HOOK THAT'S OUR CONCERN AND I APPRECIATE WE COULD PROBABLY HAVE A LONG DISCUSSION ABOUT THIS. BUT LISTEN AT THE END OF THE DAY THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES ARE THE NEW TOBACCO COMPANIES OF TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN. ANOTHER WORDS AFTER MANY MANY DECADES OF DECEIVING THE PUBLIC KNOWING. AND INTENTIONALLY DECEIVING THE PUBLIC ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THEIR PRODUCTS. THERE NOW TRY TO ESCAPE LIABILITY THROUGH WHATEVER WAY THEY CAN. THEY TRY TO DO TO THE COURT SYSTEM THE COURT SYSTEM FOUND THEM LIABLE NOW THEY'RE TRYING TO GO TO THE BALLOT. WHAT WE'RE SIMPLY SAYING IS ARE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT SOMEONE IS GOING TO PAY FOR TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN WHO ARE BEING POISONED? BY LEAD AND I HAVEN'T HEARD ANYTHING. TO SUGGEST FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE IS A WAY FOR US TO DO THIS. WE'RE HAPPY TO CONTINUE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION TO TRY AND RESOLVE THE ISSUE. BUT I WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH WITH REGARDS TO ALL COMPANIES IN THE STREAM ACCREDITS MBA AND WAITING WAITING FOR THE RIGHT APPROACH BUT WE BEAT SUPPORTIVE. AT TRYING TO LOOK AT A. HOLISTIC. YOU KNOW WHERE'S LEAD COMING FROM POWER KIDS GETTING EXPOSED WHO CAUSED THE DAMAGE HOW MUCH OF IT IS NATURAL WHAT WE DO IS A STATE. WHERE DOES THE FUNDING COME FROM ALL OF THOSE ARE GOOD DISCUSSIONS TO HAVE THAT WOULD BE ONE TO SIT DOWN AT THE TABLE WITH? CREATING LITIGATION AND WE DON'T THINK IT'S GOING TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. AND I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS AT THIS TIME AGAIN COMPANIES WHO MARKETED AT FALSELY ADVERTISE TO CONSUMERS. WHO HAD INTERNAL DOCUMENTS SAYING THEY KNEW THAT THIS WAS GOING TO? THIS WAS GOING TO IMPACT QUOTE NEGRO AND PER WRITTEN FAMILIES. THE IMPACTS THAT WE'VE SEEN AROUND THE STATE ARE AND NOW THEY'RE GOING TO VOTERS. SAYING THAT SOMEHOW HOMEOWNERS OR LIABILITY FOR FOR WHAT'S HAPPENING. WE WE WE DON'T HAVE SOLUTIONS AND AND AND LESS YOU CAN TELL US HOW WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. I THINK WE NEED WE NEED DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO OUT THE SO WITH THAT I AM OF THIS BILL. THANK YOU YOU HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND FROM THE THREATS MISCHA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR I I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY ARE I DO HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK QUESTIONS THAT I MAY. ALTHOUGH THE LANGUAGE SHELL DOES SAY THAT THE INJURED PARTY MAY ESTABLISH A PRIMA FACIE CASE THAT A PARTICULAR PARTY. OUGHT IS THE CAUSE OF THE INJURY OF THE INJURED PARTY PROVES BY PREPONDERANCE OF THE EVIDENCE. THAT A PARTY PRODUCE SOLD DISTRIBUTED OR PROMOTED. THE TYPE OF LEAD PAINT ON PIGMENT THAT CAUSED INJURY MY QUESTION DEALS WITH THE WORD PROMOTED. ARM I I THINK I THINK IT KIND OF TIES BACK TO THE EXAMPLE GIVEN BY THE OPPOSITION AND THAT IS ARE LET'S SAY IF THE LA TIMES DID DAHLE KIND OF PROMOTE. OUR YOU KNOW THE USE OF LEAD PAINT FOR EXAMPLE WHAT DID THE LA TIMES BE A HELD LIABLE. ARE IT IN THIS A SCHEME OF THINGS. AND IF IF IT'S SO YOU KNOW HOW HOW. HOW WHY WOULD IT DOES BUT IT COVER? SO I'M HAPPY TO RESPOND TO THAT AND THE LA TIMES THE OAKLAND SHOULD. OTHER PUBLICATIONS THAT RAN ADS FOR LEAD BASED PAINTS THAT IS SIMPLY ALL THAT THEY DID IT THEY DID NOT AFFIRMATIVELY PROMOTE LEAD PAINT FOR USE IN HOMES IN THE WAY THAT THE. DEFENDANTS IN OUR LAWSUIT DID AND THAT THE WAY THAT THE REST OF THE LEAD INDUSTRY DEAD AND ACTUALLY WERE AS WELL AS LONG AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INDICIA I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS VERTICALLY VERTICALLY. IN INTEGRATED INDUSTRIES WHERE COMPANIES LIKE SHERWIN WILLIAMS AND THEY WENT FROM MINE TO STORE SO THEY WHERE THE PRODUCERS THEY WORD THE DISTRIBUTORS THEY WHERE THE PROMOTERS THEY WERE THE SELLERS. THEY ON THE MINDS THE SMELTERS THE REFINERIES THE RETAIL STORES ETCETERA THEY HANDLED EVERY ASPECT FROM PRODUCTION SET SAIL. AND SO WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PROMOTION WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THOSE TYPES OF PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES WHERE THEY AFFIRMATIVELY PUT OUT THEY CREATED THE ADS THEY DISSEMINATE THE ADS THEY PRODUCED HANDBOOKS AND JINGLES. THAT TOLD THAT CONSUMERS TO USE OUR PRODUCT IN YOUR HOMES WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT NEWSPAPERS THAT SIMPLY PUBLISHED THE ADS THAT WERE CREATED. IF EVERY NEWSPAPER BECAME RESPONSIBLE FOR AND WRONGDOING THAT WAS PERPETRATED BY THE PUBLISHING OF ADS IN THEIR PAPERS THEY WOULD LONG BE OUT OF BUSINESS. AND I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WAY THAT THE FIRST AMENDMENT WORKS I DON'T THINK THAT'S HOW COURTS WOULD INTERPRET THIS STATUTE IF ADOPTED. IT THIS BILL IF ADOPTED. THIS IS ALL SUCH A. I I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THE PROMOTED PASSED. OUR LANGUAGE SO. IN YOUR DEFENSE OF OF MR CAO QUESTION. YOU SUGGESTED THAT THE COMPANY THAT WOULD BE OTHERWISE LIABLE GIVEN THE OTHER VERBS WE USED IN THE US OUT ALSO PROMOTED AND THEN YOU WENT ON TO TALK ABOUT JINGLES AND I'M THINKING PR AGENCIES AND. AND. GROUPS OF PEOPLE THAT MAYBE HAD ZERO KNOWLEDGE ABOUT ON THE DANGERS OF LEAD PAINT. WHO? WHY IS THAT WERE NECESSARY WHO ARE YOU? CAPTURING THAT WOULDN'T OTHERWISE BE CAPTURED ON AND WHY DO WE NEED THE WORD PROMOTED. YET SO I LOOK AT IT I WILL GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND ON THE LAWSUIT THAT WE FILED WITHIN NINE OTHER CITIES AND COUNTIES IN THIS CASE. M. ARE AT HIGHER. PUBLIC NUISANCE BECAUSE OF ACTION WAS PREDICATED UPON PROMOTION SO THAT DEFENDANTS IN OUR CASE WERE FOUND LIABLE FOR CREATING A PUBLIC NUISANCE IN OUR TEN JURISDICTIONS. FOR THEIR. NOT JUST PROMOTE AT PRODUCTION OF LEAD PAINT NOT JUST FOR PUTTING UP DANGEROUS PRODUCT INTO THE STREAM OF COMMERCE NOT JUST FOR SELLING A DANGEROUS PRODUCT BUT FOR THEIR AFFIRMATIVE PROMOTION. OF OF LEAD PAINT WHILE KNOWING ABOUT HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS WHILE KNOWING THAT IT WAS GOING TO CREATE A PUBLIC HEALTH CRISIS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. AND SO BECAUSE OF THAT AFFIRMATIVE PROMOTION THAT WAS FAR MORE EGREGIOUS THAN PUTTING A DANGEROUS PRODUCT INTO THE STREAM OF COMMERCE THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE HELD ACCOUNTABLE FOR AND THAT'S WHAT. EXISTING PUBLIC NUISANCE LAW ALREADY PROVIDES LIABILITY FOR SO SO MAYBE THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SENTENCE SHOULD INCLUDE AND PROMOTED RATHER THAN OR PROMOTED. THAT'S ONE POSSIBILITY ALTHOUGH AND IF YOU AGAIN AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEBODY WHO PROMOTED. LEAD PAINT. THAT YOU NEED THE STAND ALONE TERM PROMOTED WITHOUT TYING IT TO KNOWLEDGE SOME SORT CONSTRUCTING KNOWLEDGE OF OF. MANUFACTURING DISTRIBUTING THAT REQUIRES US TO KEEP AYE I'M. YOU'RE YOU'RE NOT MAKING ME MORE COMFORTABLE YOU'RE MAKING ME MORE UNCOMFORTABLE BECAUSE I AM. UNCLEAR AT WHO YOU'RE ACTUALLY TRYING TO GET OUT AND IT SEEMS THAT THERE COULD BE. FOLKS WHO MAY BE OUR SHOULD NOT BE HELD LIABLE YEAH AND ONE WAY THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO RESOLVE THIS IS BY SAYING. THAT IT'S THE PROMOTERS WHO HAD KNOWLEDGE OF THE HARMS THAT THAT WE'RE GOING TO BEAT THAT WOULD RESULT FROM THE LEAD PAINT THAT THEY ARE PROMOTING. THANK YOU AND I'M TO THE AUTHOR I I ASSUME WE'LL WE'LL SEE SOME OF THESE CHANGES IF THE* OUT TODAY. YEAH GOOD POINT SET SUCH WHAT I'M A LISTENING TO OPPOSITIONS POINTS CONCERNS FROM THAT ARE MY COLLEAGUES AND. I'M TAKING CAREFUL NOTES HERE ABOUT SOME WASTE IMPROVE THE BILL STRENGTHENED TECHNIQUE. THERE HAS BEEN A SECOND WE DO HAVE EMOTIONS. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. RIGHT. SO. MISTRESS IN THIS REMINDS ME SO MUCH OF THE ASBESTOS CASES WE HAD SO MANY PEOPLE WHO WERE INJURED IN TRYING TO FIND THE MANUFACTURERS. TRYING TO FIND THOSE UNTIL FINALLY THAT THE ISSUE WAS RESOLVED I THINK WE ARE HEADED IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WE DO KNOW THAT THE CHILDREN ARE SUFFERING IRREPARABLE HARM. THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE FOR THESE CHILDREN THEY'VE BEEN EXPOSED AND THEY WILL SUFFER THE REST OF THEIR LIVES BECAUSE OF THIS EXPOSURE. AND TO MAKE IT EVEN MORE EGREGIOUS IS THE FACT THAT THE LEAD OR THE PINK COMPANIES KNEW WHAT THEY WERE DOING. THAT'S WHY AFTER THE EIGHTEEN YEARS FINALLY THEY ARE FOUND. A LIABLE THEY'RE TOLD TO PUT THE ONE POINT ONE BILLION DOLLARS UP AS A FUND BECAUSE OF THISIS. THE DAMAGE THEY'VE ALREADY BECAUSE. THERE WERE SOME. STUDIES THAT WERE SHARED WITH US ALSO. IN THE ANALYSIS ABOUT THE COST OF ABATEMENT VERSUS THE COST OF HAVING TO KNOW CARE FOR THESE CHILDREN WHO WERE EXPOSED. BECAUSE OF AND I I I AGREE WITH MY MY COLLEAGUE. WE HAVE TO INCLUDE THE WORD GREED IN THIS. BECAUSE IT WAS THE GREED OF THE THE PAINT COMPANIES KNOWING THAT THEY WERE STILL MAKING MONEY ON THE BACKS ON THE LIVES OF THESE CHILDREN. SO I I'M GLAD THAT YOU'VE INTRODUCES LEGISLATION I'M GLAD THAT THEIR COMMENTS ABOUT SOME WAYS TO MAKE IT BETTER MAKE IT STRONGER. BUT I THINK THE ENTIRE IDEA BEHIND YOUR BILL IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND IT IS SOMETHING NECESSARY. TO HELP THOSE CHILDREN THAT ARE GOING TO SUFFER FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES SO I THANK YOU FOR THE BILL. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS AND I. SEEING NONE MISTER BONTA MIKLOS YEAH I JUST WANNA THANK EVERYBODY FOR THE COMMENTS ABOUT THE OPPOSITION FOR FOR FOR POINTING OUT THEIR CONCERNS MY COLLEAGUES FOR SHARING WITH ME THERE'S. AND I'M GONNA TAKE A CLOSE LOOK AT THESE ISSUES THAT AND REYES AND AND DO OUR BEST AS WE ALWAYS DO IN THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS TO STRENGTHEN THE BILL AND AND MAKE IT TIGHTER. YOU KNOW IT IN THE END. WE HAVE CHILDREN AND OTHERS WHO ARE INNOCENT VICTIMS AND AMBER POISONED. BY PEDDLERS OF LEAD PAINT EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING. AND THERE WAS A DUTY. AND A BREACH OF THAT DUTY BY THE DIFFERENT MANUFACTURERS. AND. WE HAVE A VICTIM WHO'S BEEN HURT. BY A CERTAIN TYPE OF OF LEAD PAINT PIGMENT. AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THE MANY. NEGLIGENT ACTORS IS THE ONE WHO CAUSED IT. THEY DON'T HAVE THE RECORDS TIME IS PAST RECORDS HAVE BEEN. LOST OR MAYBE NEVER EXISTED. AND THEY KNOW THEY'VE BEEN HURT AND SO ALL THIS BILL SAYS IS IN IT WHAT DO YOU DO ON THAT OCCASION DO YOU DO YOU LET. THE NEGATIVE ACTORS STAND AS A GROUP POINT ONE ANOTHER AND SAY IT MAY HAVE BEEN THE OTHER WHAT NOT ME. THAT YOU CAN'T PROVE EXACTLY WHO IT IS WE ALL GET OFF SCOT FREE. THAT'S WRONG. WE HAVE OUR LAW HAS ADDRESSED THAT VERY ISSUE MULTIPLE TIMES WHETHER IT BE WITH THINGS LIKE RACE IPSO LOCKWOOD OR THE SUMMER VERSUS TYPES ALTERNATE LIABILITY CASE. WE'VE WE'VE ADDRESSED THAT AND WE'VE HAD BURDEN SHIFTING IN OTHER OCCASIONS AND AND WE HAVE IT NOW AND AND IT'S A POLICY RECENT AND IT IT SET FORTH VERY CLEARLY IN THE COLLINS CASE. IT SAYS THAT THAT THIS RULE THIS THIS BURDEN SHIFTING WHICH CHEFS. I'M THE BURDEN OF CAUSATION TO THE DEFENDANT. IT REPRESENTS A POLICY DETERMINATION THAT AN INNOCENT PLAINTIFF SHOULD NOT BE WITHOUT REMEDY. BECAUSE HE OR SHE IS UNABLE TO PERFECT TO PROVE WHICH OF THE NEGLIGENT DEFENDANTS BECAUSE THE HEART. EXACTLY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE. THERE WAS NEGLIGENCE HARM WAS CAUSED SOMEONE WAS HURT THEY WERE POISONED AN INNOCENT CHILD IN MANY CASES AND THEY JUST DON'T KNOW WHICH OF THE MANY NEGATIVE ACTORS IT WAS. THE MAJOR ACTORS KNOW WHAT THEY DID THEY HAVE THEIR RECORDS THEY CAN PROVE THAT THEY DIDN'T DISTRIBUTE THE PAINT AND A CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIC AREA OR AT A CERTAIN TIME. THEY HAVE THAT ABILITY TO AND I'M SURE THAT THEY WEREN'T THE ONE. OUT BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE GIVING. THAT THE BAD ACTORS IMMUNITY WHILE WE DISALLOW INNOCENT POISON CHILDREN FROM AND JUSTICE THAT'S WHY WE HAVE THIS BILL. THAT'S WHY I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AGO THANK YOU.

THAT HAS BEEN IN THREE DIFFERENT FACILITIES AND NOW THERE'S BEEN A FOURTH PROGRAM AT A WHICH IS A FEDERAL FOSTER CARE PROGRAM AND THE REASON WHY THAT'S SO IMPORTANT IS BECAUSE. THERE ARE MORE AND MORE CHILDREN WHO ARE NOT RELEASED FROM FEDERAL DETENTION TO FAMILY MEMBERS BECAUSE THEY'RE SO MUCH MORE FEAR IN THE COMMUNITY. OF COMING FORWARD AND SO MANY MORE CHILDREN ARE AND WILL BE. SPENDING MORE AND MORE TIME IN FEDERAL CUSTODY AND SO OBVIOUSLY WE DON'T WANT THOSE CHILDREN IN SHELTERS OUR DETENTION FACILITIES WE WANT THEM AND FAMILY SO THIS THAT. THE COMING ON OF THIS FEDERAL FOSTER CARE PROGRAM HAS BEEN A REALLY GOOD NEWS FOR FORT FOR CHILDREN IN OUR AREA. AND THE PROBLEM IS BECAUSE. THIS PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND OTHERS THAT COULD COME ON ARE BASED IN ANOTHER STATE EVEN OTHER LICENSED HERE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO SERVICE GUARDIANS WHICH PRECLUDES A FORM OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF CALLED SPECIAL IMMIGRANT JUVENILE STATUS. ON AS ADVOCATES FOR CHILDREN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THE CHILDREN THAT WE REPRESENT CAN PURSUE ANY FORM OF IMMIGRATION RELIEF. AVAILABLE TO THEM WE NEVER WANT THEM TO HAVE TO CHOOSE ON TO GIVE ONE OF THOSE FORMS OF RELIEF UP IN ORDER TO TAKE A PLACEMENT THAT'S IN THEIR BEST INTERESTS THESE ARE THE MOST VULNERABLE OF THE VULNERABLE IMMIGRANTS THESE ARE UNACCOMPANIED CHILDREN WHO DO NOT HAVE FAMILY HERE. TO BE RELEASED TO ON AND THEY HAVE EXPERIENCE EXTREME TRAUMA WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY'RE IN THE BEST POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENT. WHICH WE BELIEVE IT'S A ARE THESE FAMILY HOMES AND WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE UP SOMETHING IN THEIR IMMIGRATION CASE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE SERVICES.

SEVENTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIANS RENT THE PLACE THEY CALL HOME. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA LAW ALLOWS LANDLORDS TO EVICT TENANTS WITHOUT PROVIDING A REASON. FOR OF ACTION WITH WITH GROWING HOUSING COSTS LACK OF HOUSING. APPLY IN SHORT EVICTION NOTICES FINDING A NEW PLACE TO LIVE AFTER BEING EVICTED CAN BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT FAMILIES WHO ARE AFFECTED CAN BE PUSHED INTO HOMELESSNESS. OR UNSTABLE SHELTER FOR MONTHS OR YEARS FOLLOWING EVICTION UNJUSTIFIED EVICTIONS BECAUSE LOS DISPLACEMENT AND HARDSHIP ON FAMILIES. ACROSS THE STATE. AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE SEEKS TO PREVENT DISCRIMINATORY ARBITRARY OR RETALIATORY EVICTIONS AND ENSURE THAT EVICTIONS ARE FAIR AND JUST. THIS BILL REQUIRES PROPERTY OWNERS TO PROVIDE TENANTS A CAUSE FOR ADDICTION IN THE NOTICE OF EVICTION. FURTHERMORE THIS BILL WILL HELP ENSURE THAT TENANTS WHO HAVE FOLLOWED THE RULES ABIDED BY THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THEIR LEASE AND PAY THE RENT ON TIME. DO NOT LOSE THE PLACE THEY CALL HOME DUE TO CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP FORECLOSURE OF PROPERTY. OR EXPIRATION OF A FIXED TERM LEASE. THE HISTORY CULTURE AND CHARACTER OF OUR COMMUNITIES SUFFER WHEN RESIDENTS LIVE WITH NO HOUSING SECURITY FORCING THEM TO MOVE FROM HOME. TO HOME AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE WILL HELP PROTECT CALIFORNIAN TENANTS FROM LIVING IN UNCERTAINTY. HOPING THEY ARE NOT UNJUSTLY EVICTED FROM ONE DAY TO THE NEXT JUST CAUSE OF ACTION POLICIES PROTECT MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES SUCH AS THE. ELDERLY LOW INCOME RESIDENTS PEOPLE OF COLOR AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES PROVIDING THEM A STABLE HOUSING IN THE MIDST OF A DEVASTATING HOUSING CRISIS.

WITH ME HERE TODAY IS DEEMED PASSED AN EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR TENET'S TOGETHER CHRIS THE GRACE ASORIO TENET NOW MEDIA. AND MAKE IT A BALLOT DIRECTOR OF ADVOCACY AND ORGANIZING FOR TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING. MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS TEAM PRESIDENT SECULAR DIRECTOR OF TENANTS TOGETHER CALIFORNIA'S STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION FOR RENTERS RIGHTS I WORK COALITION A FIFTY. A LOCAL TENANT ORGANIZATIONS ACROSS THE STATE WORKING TO PROTECT AND ADVANCE THE RIGHTS OF A CALIFORNIA TENANTS TO SAFE DECENT. AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE APPRECIATE AYE MR BONTA AS LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT EFFORT TO BAN ARBITRARY ADDICTION I IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AS WELL AS A MISTER CHOOSE CO AUTHORSHIP OF THE BILL. TENANTS TOGETHER HAS OPERATED CALIFORNIA'S ONLY STATEWIDE RENTERS RIGHTS HOTLINE FOR NEARLY A DECADE UP THROUGH THAT HOTLINE WE COUNSELED OVER TEN THOUSAND A TENANT HOUSEHOLDS. WE DEAL WITH TENANTS EVERYDAY FROM ACROSS THE STATE WHO WERE EVICTED FOR NO GOOD REASON FOR NO REASON AT ALL AND PREDICTION NOTICES THAT DO NOT STATE. BECAUSE FOR OF ACTION AND PARTICULARLY IN THIS HOUSING CRISIS THESE CONVICTIONS ARE HEARTBREAKING. THE LANDLORDS IN THESE VICTIMS DO NOT STATE A REASON FOR EVICTION BECAUSE THE LAW DOES NOT REQUIRE THEM TO DO SO MANY OF OUR CALLERS ARE ABSOLUTELY SHOCKED WHEN THEY CALL OUR HOTLINE. AND FIND OUT THAT IT IS LEGAL IN CALIFORNIA TO VICTOR TENANT WITHOUT EVEN STATE STATING THE REASON FOR THE OBJECTION. MOST OF THE IS NO FAULT OF ACTIONS AND NO BECAUSE OF ACTIONS. ARE IT RETALIATORY SITUATIONS WHERE LANDLORDS HAVE REQUESTED REPAIRS. AND THEN THE LANDLORD THE TENANT REQUEST REPAIRS THE LAMBERT RESPONSE OUT WITH EVICTION NOTICE THAT DOES NOT STATE. THE REASON FOR EVICTION I WANNA POINT OUT ONE THING AND THAT IS FEATURED IN THE OPPOSITION HA ARGUMENTS WHICH IS. THAT SOMEHOW THIS BILL WILL MAKE IT HARDER TO EVICT TENANTS WHO ENGAGE IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THEIR SEPARATE PROVISIONS IN CALIFORNIA LAW. THAT ALLOW FOR EVICTION ON THREE DAYS NOTICE OF TENANTS WHO ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE ENGAGED IN ANY KIND OF MISCONDUCT OR BROKEN THEIR LEASE OR FAILED TO PAY THE RENT. THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THOSE EVICTIONS IN ANY WAY. TWENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE LANGUAGE THE STATE THE REASON IF THEY CHOOSE TO VICTOR TENANTS WITH NOT TOO MUCH TO ASK IT'S A MATTER OF BASIC FAIRNESS. TENANTS SHOULD NOT LOSE THEIR HOMES WITHOUT A REASON STATED IN A NOTICE TO TERMINATE TENDENCY. WE URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. THE MORNING MY NAME IS CRYSTAL SORIA I WAS ONE OF THE TENETS OF FOUR SEVENTY CENTRAL AVENUE AND ALAMEDA WHICH IS HOME TO MOSTLY FILIPINO IMMIGRANT FAMILIES. A IT WAS BEFORE THE CHRISTMAS OF TWENTY FIFTEEN WHEN MY FAMILY AND MY FELLOW TENANTS. ALWAYS HAVE RECEIVED EVICTION NOTICES. AND THE NOTICE DID NOT GIVE ANY SUBSTANTIAL OR JUST RECENT TO AFFECT US. OTHER THAN THAT THEY WANTED TO RENOVATED AND WE HAVE TO RE APPLY TO COME BACK. IN. WHICH WAS NOT EVEN A GUARANTEE BECAUSE THEY WERE GOING TO INCREASE THE RENT FOR ALL UNITS. AND MY FELLOW TENANTS. HAVE BEEN FIGHTING EVICTION ATTEMPTS FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS NOW I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL WHEN I GOT THE EVICTION NOTICE AND I'M NOW HALFWAY THROUGH MY COLLEGE YEARS AND STILL. JUSTICE IS STILL NOT SERVE. AND JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO OUR FIGHT FOR JUST BECAUSE. JUST GOT RESCINDED. IN ALAMEDA AND EVERYDAY THE TENETS OF FOUR SEVENTY ARE STILL IN RISK OF ADDICTION AS WELL AS OTHER TENANTS IN CITIES IN CALIFORNIA. BUT STILL WE RISE. WE RECOGNIZE THE PASSING OR EXTENDING MORATORIUM'S WILL NOT SOLVE THE ROOT PROBLEMS OF THIS ISSUE. AND. SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY AND. NOW I AM HERE SIMPLY ASKING YOU ALL TO PASS A B. TWENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE. SO THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S LANDLORDS WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO. GIVE TENANTS A JUST REASON WHY THEY'RE TRYING TO VEGAS. AND A JEALOUS I CHARGE THEE ALL TO SERVE THE PEOPLE AND. PROVIDE JUSTICE AND PROTECTION FOR ALL TENANTS IN A CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD MORNING MEGAN ABLE WITH TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE. I. THINK YOU MEMBERS FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS BILL. I'M ADVOCACY IN ORGANIZING DIRECTOR OF THE TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE AND WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE TWENTY FIVE. I THE TECH EQUITY COLLABORATIVE IS A MEMBERSHIP ORGANIZATION AND WE REPRESENTS THOUSANDS OF TECH WORKERS IN THE BAY AREA. I. WHEW A BELIEVE THAT THE TECH ECONOMY CAN AND SHOULD WORK FOR EVERYONE. AND WIN VISION OF CALIFORNIA IN WHICH THE GROWTH OF THE TECH SECTOR LEADS TO BROAD BASED ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL RESIDENTS IN OUR STATE RATHER THAN DEEPENING IN EQUITY. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS COMMONSENSE TENANT PROTECTION. IS THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS THAT VISION I WELL THE TECH INDUSTRY DIDN'T CREATE THE UNDERLYING ISSUES THAT ARE CAUSING THE CALIFORNIA HOUSING CRISIS. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE FAST GROWTH OF OUR INDUSTRY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE PUSHING OUT LONG TERM TENANTS. AND RESIDENTS I'M FROM BONE RIPPLE COMMUNITIES. WE FEEL WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO USE OUR VOICE ADVOCATE FOR POLICY YOU. AYE THAT WILL MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERYONE WHO WANTS TO LIVE HERE ACCESS A STABLE HOUSING AND PREVENT DISPLACEMENT. THAT'S THE REASON WHY I'M HERE TODAY AND MY ORGANIZATION IS SUPPORTING THE SPELL. THIS BASIC REFORM HAS DESPERATELY NEEDED TO KEEP TENANTS IN OUR STATE GUARDED FROM BASELESS DISPLACEMENT. NEARLY FORTY SIX PERCENT OF CALIFORNIANS ARE IN LIQUID ASSET POVERTY. MEANING THAT WHEN MIDDLE AND LOW INCOME RESIDENTS RECEIVE IN INCOME SHOCKLEY COULD BE USELESS ADDICTION THEY'RE OFTEN NOT ABLE TO WEATHER THE STORM. WE NEED TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS ARE BECAUSE WE YOU KNOW VERY WELL FROM WHAT HAPPENED ACROSS THE BAY AREA. THAT SO. WE NEED TO PROTECT OUR TENANTS FROM DISPLACEMENT AND THE FIBER OF VIBRANT COMMUNITIES. AS MEMBERS OF THE TECH COMMUNITY WANT TO BE SURE THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS HAVE THE RESILIENCY TO WRITE OUT THE WAVE. AND NOT BE WASHED OUT AND JUST BECAUSE PROTECTIONS I ARE NEEDED NOW.

CLEAR THE TABLES FOR OPPOSITION TO. COME UP AND GIVE MORNING MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS I DEBRA CARLTON WITH THE CALIFORNIA PARDON ASSOCIATION. UNFORTUNATELY A THIS BILL THAT THE PROVIDE ANY PROTECTION. UNFORTUNATELY. FOR THE. INDIVIDUALS WHO CAME TO TESTIFY. IN SUPPORT WE FEAR THAT IT'S SIMPLY GOING TO LEAD AS WE INDICATED. IN OUR LETTER TO INCREASE RENTS I'M NOT SAYING THAT'S RIGHT. I'M SAYING THAT'S THE UNFORTUNATE PART OF WHAT WE DON'T NEED TO SEE RITE NOW IN OUR CURRENT ECONOMIC SITUATION WITH LACK. OF HOUSING FOR INDIVIDUALS TO MOVE TO THIS BILL DOESN'T PREVENT. LAMBERT FROM RAISING THE RENT. BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT JUST BECAUSE WAS CREATED. IN RENT CONTROL JURISDICTIONS. TO PREVENT LANDLORDS FROM SIMPLY RAISING THE RENT. A I'D AND MOVING TENANTS OUT TO RAISE THE RENT. WE ALREADY HAVE STATUTES THAT CREATES A PROHIBITION FOR RETALIATORY EVICTION WE ALREADY HAVE A STATUTE. THE PROHIBITS LANDLORDS FROM TERMINATING A TENDENCY BECAUSE OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE SITUATION. A LANDLORD CAN STILL MOVE IT TURNED OUT TO DO THE REHAB AS WE HEARD EARLIER THIS BILL DOESN'T DO ANY OF THAT. SO FOR ALL OF THOSE REASONS. WE CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THE. THANK YOU ALL TAKE TWO MORE WITNESSES THAT'S WHAT. THE CHAIRMAN OF MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE RUN KINGSTON I REPRESENT FOR REGIONAL APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS. THE SPACE SOUTHERN CITIES ORANGE COUNTY AND. DORK VALLEY. WE TO JOIN IN OPPOSITION THIS BILL. THEIR COUPLE POINTS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO EMPHASIZE. IT'S BILL ENCOURAGES OPEN INTERPRETATION BY EVERY AT A COURT HEARING AN UNLAWFUL DETAINER. IN ANY DISPUTE THERE'S NO GUIDANCE IN THIS BILL. THE CURRENT LAWS ON EVICTION ARE VERY VERY CLEAR THEY'RE DIFFERENT THEN WHAT WE ARE TALKING ABOUT IN TERMINATION EVICTION IS FOR. NON PAY THAT'S THE PRINCIPAL REASON FOR IT. BREACH OF LEAKS. YOU'RE COMMITTING WASTE YOUR. YOU'RE DOING A NUMBER OF OTHER. ELEMENTS WHICH ARE IN VIOLATION AT LEAST ILLEGAL HOLDOVERS THOSE ARE EGGS VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLES. COURTS ADVISED BY THE PARTIES THE LYTIC THE BOTH THE LITIGANTS. THAT INVOLVED IN THE CASE KNOW THE RULES HOWEVER IN THIS THERE ARE NO RULES IT IS THE WILD WILD WEST WHEN YOU GO TO COURT. IF A LANDLORD SPECIFIES WHICH THIS BILL DOES. ANY TYPE OF STATEMENT. THE COURT WILL LEAVE IT TO OPEN INTERPRETATION. EVERY DAY THAT THE ATTORNEYS REPRESENTING THE PARTIES WILL HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THE COURT WILL FIND AS THE RULES OF THE GAME IF YOU WILL. WHAT NEEDS TO HAPPEN IF IT IS A LATE PAY IN THE SLAMMER DECIDES TO? PURSUE AGAINST THAT OF MAYBE ONE COURT SAYS. THERE ARE FOUR LATE PAYS WHICH ARE TOLERABLE GIVE THE TENANT MORE TIME. SECOND THERE ARE SAID THERE WERE TWO POINTS. THERE ARE A LOT OF TIMES WHEN A LAMB OR CHOOSES TO TERMINATE THE TENANCY IT'S THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS Y.. AND THEY DON'T DO THIS IN A MALICIOUS WAY AS HAS BEEN. ALLEGED. THE REASON WHY YOU TERMINATE THE TENANCY THAT THE TENET IS PLAYING THE STEREO CONSTANTLY AT TWO THIRTY AT NIGHT. AND THE OTHER TENANTS THE GOOD TENANTS ARE COMPLAINING. THOSE GOOD TENANTS DO NOT WANT TO ACT AS A WITNESS THEY WILL NOT TAKE OFF FROM WORK. THEY WILL NOT GO TO COURT THEY WILL THEY WILL CHOOSE OTHER ALTERNATIVE PATHS. THEY'LL LEAVE AND VACATE. CAN LEAVING. THE TENANT FOR THE OFFENDING TENET THERE IN RESIDENTS THE QUESTION BEFORE THE COMMITTEE IS WHO ARE WE TRYING TO PROTECT LAMBERTS DON'T DO THIS MALICIOUSLY. THIS CARLTON POINTED OUT THERE A NUMBER OF OTHER LAWS ARE ANTI DISCRIMINATION LAWS WHICH WE HAVE ALWAYS SUPPORTED. RETALIATORY EVICTION PROTECTIONS HABITABILITY THEIR NUMBERS OF LOS. SO WE ARE NOT IN A A MYSTERY OR A BLACK HOLE IF YOU WILL. KNOWING WHAT A LANDLORDS CONDUCT MUST BE AND THEY MUST BEAT STRONGLY ADHERED TO. FOR THESE AND OTHER REASONS. PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE THERE ARE NO GUIDING PRINCIPLES TO THE COURT. AS TO WHAT THE COURT SHALL BE DIRECTED TO CONSIDER WE MUST AND REGRETFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL. IMMEDIATE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SAYS HE PARLOUS AND FOR THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATION OF GREATER LOS ANGELES IN THE SANTA BARBARA RENTAL PROPERTY ASSOCIATION. OFTENTIMES WHEN WE'RE UP HERE WE HERE EXTREME ANECDOTES OF OF SITUATIONS WHICH NONE OF US SUPPORT. THE OVERWHELMING MAJORITY AND I'M TALKIN THAT NINETY EIGHT PERCENT OF LANDLORDS TO NOT EVICT. GOOD TENANTS. HAVING A VACANCY IN YOUR APARTMENT IS WAY MORE COSTLY. OF THAN ANYTHING ELSE. SO IT'S AS A LAST RESORT THAT DAY AND OWNER WLL PURSUE THAT SO CALLED NO FOR NO FAULT THIRTY TO SIXTY DAY. TERMINATION. AND THAT IS AS AS MISTER KING SENATE'S POINTED OUT TO REALLY PROTECT THE OTHER TENANTS AND FOR THE OWNER TO. SUPPORT HIS OR HER DUTY. TO MAINTAIN THE QUIET ENJOYMENT FOR THE OTHER TENANTS. WE DON'T SUPPORT. JUST BECAUSE EVICTION. CITIES ARE ENTITLED TO ENACT JUST CAUSE OF ACTION. IT'S BEEN FIFTEEN OR EIGHTEEN CITIES SOME OF WHICH HAVE RENT CONTROL SOME OF WHICH DO NOT THEY'RE FREE TO DO SO. FOR ITS THE STATE NOW TO IMPOSE ITS WILL ON THIS ISSUE. WE BELIEVE WILL HAVE SO MANY ADVERSE CONSEQUENCES FOR THE GOOD TENANTS. WITH AND WE BUT LIKE THE THE COMMITTEE TO REALLY THINK ABOUT THAT AND FOR THOSE REASONS WE MUST. RESPECTFULLY. OPPOSE THE BILL. I'M LIKE I COULD TAKE MORE TO SOMEBODY BUT YOU CAN JUST GIVE YOUR NAME AND. OPPOSITION THANK YOU JIM LIGHTS ON BEHALF OF THE NATIONAL RENTAL HOME COUNCIL COMPRISED OF COMPANIES THAT OWN A SINGLE FAMILY RENTAL PROPERTIES AND NOW WITH THE POLICIES TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER BONTA WHERE LATE OPPONENTS TO THE BILL. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION AYE MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS PATRON WITH THEIR AND READING ASSOCIATES REPRESENTING THE SAN DIEGO COUNTY APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WERE POSED FOR REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED THANK YOU A GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF CREAM THREE CM HALF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS. WERE OPPOSED TO THE BILL FOR THE REASONS PEOPLE HE'S PREVIOUSLY STATED RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOU KNOW VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SINGLE BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. KALRA. THANK YOU SHARE OF AND THINK YOU OF MISTER BONTA JUST WIND UP IN A CLARIFICATION THE. ONLY CITY IN MY JURISDICTION OF SAN JOSE WE HAVE OUR OWN. OF ORDINANCE REGARDING JUST BECAUSE I WAS PUT INTO PLACE LAST YEAR MY READING OF THE BILL IS THAT. IT IT. WELL REMAINS IN PLACE THEY ALTHOUGH THE LOCAL ORDINANCES BECAUSE SOUNDS DAYS ACTUALLY LIST TWELVE SPECIFIC. INSTANCES OF MINE THAT. JUST BECAUSE CAN BE A VOTE IN ITS AND THEY'RE PRETTY BROAD AND DEAL WITH A NEW SENSE AND ALL OTHER RANGE OF. OF A DIFFERENT ACTIVITIES AND BEHAVIORS INCLUDING GOVERNMENT ORDERS BUT HAVE YOU. THAT BEING SAID I DO LIKE THE FACT THAT IT THAT THE BILL DOES INCENTIVIZE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO TAKE THAT STEP. I THINK THAT. YEAH THAT IF THERE ARE SOME DOWNWARD PRESSURE TO DO THAT. I'D LIKE TO BE A GOOD THING I THINK IT WAS IT WAS AN EASY PROCESS PUBLICITY GO THROUGH BECAUSE THE OTHER A LOT OF PEOPLE IN DIFFICULT HEARINGS BUT I THINK THAT'S THE ROLE OF OF. A LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO GO TO THAT PROSTITUTE BUT IT'S BEST FOR THEM. AND I THINK THAT A LOT OF THE THE. THE ANY DEGREE OF. CONCERN A CRITICISM THAT THIS IS TOO BROAD BECAUSE NOT A SPECIFICITY WELL LOCAL ORDINANCES CAN ADD THAT SPECIFICITY SPECIFICITY AS IT SUITS THEIR JURISDICTION AND THAT'S WHAT SAN JOSE DID AND AND SO GIVEN THE FACT. THAT THIS BILL DOES NOT SUPERSEDE THE WORK THAT WAS DONE. A BY THEJURISDICTION I REPRESENT. I'M CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE SUPPORTING IT AND HOPE THAT OTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TAKE THE ACTIONS THAT. THE DIFFICULT ACTIONS THAT SOUNDS A DID TO COME TOGETHER AS A COMMUNITY AND DETERMINE WHAT WORKS BEST FOR BOTH THE LANDLORDS AS WELL AS THE TENANTS. THE OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS MISERY. I DO WANT TO THANK THE YOUNG WOMAN WHO TESTIFIED EARLIER ABOUT BEING EVICTED AND HER EXPERIENCE I THINK IT'S ALWAYS IMPORTANT TO HEAR THOSE EXPERIENCES. I HAVE A QUESTION FOR THE AUTHOR AND IT GOES ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN JOSE. I KNOW SAN JOSE DOES HAVE A JUST CAUSE. KLAUS. ORDINANCE. IS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION DOES THE BILL NOW REQUIRED THAT EVERY CITY HAVE. JUST BECAUSE. OR DOES IT LEAVE IT TO THE CITIES TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY WANT TO ENACT A JUST CLAUSE ORDINANCE. THE BILL THAT THE COUPLE THINGS ONE IT. IT HAS CLEAR LANGUAGE IN SECTION DE INDICATING THAT THIS BILL. DOES NOT SUPERSEDE OR PREEMPT ANY OTHER ANY LOCAL ORDINANCE SO TO THE EXTENT SAN JOSE OR OTHER CITIES DALY CITY ARE SO UNION CITY ALREADY HAVE JUST BECAUSE ORDINANCES THOSE REMAIN INTACT UNTOUCHED BY. BY THIS THIS MEASURE THIS MEASURE WOULD BE ON THAT REQUIRE STATEWIDE THAT. FOR ANY OF IT YOU NOTICE A COSBY ARTICULATED IN THE NOTICE AND THEN AFTER THAT IT SAYS THREE THINGS. ARE NOT BECAUSE FOR ADDICTION BOB FOR FORECLOSURE CHANGE OF OWNERSHIP AND AND AND OF A OF A FIXED TERM LEASE. UP SO IT IT'S REALLY BARE BONES BUT THE REQUIREMENT AND EXERCISE THAT A LANDLORD ARTICULATE A CAUSE FOR FICTION I THINK WILL REALLY HELP NARROW. OBJECTIONS TO TO FAIR AND JUST WANTS RATHER THAN RETALIATORY OR DISCRIMINATORY OR ARBITRARY OF ACTIONS I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND THAT ALL TENANTS ALL SEVENTEEN MILLION OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA SHOULD ENJOY. A THAT THAT PROTECTION. IT ALSO JUST SAYS THAT IN THREE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE OPTICALLY CONTROVERSY THAT THOSE ARMED DO NOT CONSTITUTE BECAUSE FOR AN ADDICTION AND AFTER THAT EVERY LOCALITY CAN CAN CAN DO NOTHING. AT OR OR BUILD UP ON ON THIS FOUNDATION AS MUCH AS THEY LIKE IN MIDDLE BE UP TO UP TO THEM. AND THEY MAY EVEN IF THEY LIKE THAT DECIDE TO THE PAIR. A JUST CAUSE ORDINANCE WITH WITH RENT CONTROL. SOMETHING THAT WAS ALLUDED TO IN THE OPPOSITION AS AS A SORT OF MORE OPTIMAL PROTECTION FOR TEN BUT WE DIDN'T GO THERE THAT'S UP FOR LOCALS TO DECIDE. AND AND AND THEY MAY IF THEY WISH. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. GONZALEZ FLETCHER MAY BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY I'M. I WAS. I HAVE SOME CONCERNS BUT I AM GONNA BUT YOU SUPPORTING IT OUT MAINLY BECAUSE AND. A WOMAN. NAME CYNTHIA CALLED OUR OFFICE AND. SPOKE IN TOW HAULING YOUR MOM IS A SUPPORTER OF YOUR BILL SPOKEN TO COLLEAGUES MY STAFF AND KNEW THE NUMBER OF FILIPINOS.

THANK YOU I'M GONNA ASK MY MOTHER TO CALL THAT SENATOR THOUSANDS OPPOSITE XO GOT UP BILL. I HAVE A PICNIC. OUR FIRST I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE FOR THE CONVERSATION ON THIS IMPORTANT BILL THERE'S ONE THING IN THE STAFF ANALYSIS THAT I THOUGHT WAS WAS INTERESTING IN AND. OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF NOTED THAT THE APARTMENT ASSOCIATIONS THAT. ARE ARGUING THAT JUST BECAUSE ORDINANCES ARE LOCAL ISSUE THAT SHOULD BE DECIDED BY INDIVIDUAL CITIES. ARE THE SAME ASSOCIATIONS THAT HAVE SPONSORED AND CONTINUE TO SUPPORT THE COSTA HAWKINS ACT. WHICH APPLIES A STATEWIDE ONE SIZE FITS ALL MANDATE TO TO LIMIT RENT CONTROL. AND I I THINK WE ALL APPRECIATE SOME OF THE IRONY IN THAT. BUT I I THINK YOU KNOW WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. WE DON'T KNOW AT THIS TIME TENANTS ARE EXPERIENCING THE MOST INTENSE CRISIS. EVER REALLY OUR STATE HISTORY AND. AND MY HOPE AND I WOULD ASK YOU PART ASSOCIATION TO TO WORK WITH US TO TRY TO CRAFT. TENET LEGISLATION PROVIDE SOME RELIEF BECAUSE FOR THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN TRYING TO MOVE THINGS FORWARD. I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATION IN THE ONGOING DIALOGUE. BUT AT THIS POINT BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED OPPOSITION WE HAVE TO KEEP PUSHING. A TO TO DO WHAT WE CAN AYE MY CITY IS ONE THAT HAS EXPERIENCE JUST BECAUSE. PROTECTIONS ARE CLEARLY THAT HAS NOT HAMPERED. THE RENTAL MARKET IN SAN FRANCISCO OR ANOTHER CITIES THAT WE'VE HAD AND I ALSO APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENTS TO I KNOW ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS.

WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER ONE AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE. CHAU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. OUR FIRST OF ALL I WILL ACCEPT OUT THE AMENDMENTS ON PAGES FIVE AND SIX OF THE ANALYSIS. THIS BILL AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL REQUIRE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCIES OR CCR RATES. TO PATCH VULNERABLE COMPUTER SYSTEMS WILL BE SUBJECT TO A CIVIL LIVE A LIABILITIES AWARDED TO INDIVIDUALS WHOSE DATA WAS COMPROMISE. AUG TWENTY SEVENTEEN EQUIFAX A DATA BREACH RESULTED IN THE LOSS OF HUNDRED AND FORTY SEVEN POINT NINE MILLION U. S. CONSUMERS PERSONAL INFORMATION. PRIOR TO THE BREACH TO YOU UNITED STATES DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY NOTIFY EQUIFAX. OTHER COMPANIES ON MARCH TO A TWENTY SEVENTEEN OF THE NEED. A PATCH SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN SOFTWARE CALL APACHE STRUTS. HOWEVER THAT PATCH NEVER OCCURRED. ARE CONSEQUENTLY BETWEEN MAY THIRTEEN IN JULY THIRTIETH TWENTY SEVENTEEN HACKERS EXPLOITED. ó THE VULNERABILITY TO ACCESS SENSITIVE INFORMATION INCLUDING CONSUMER NAME SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS BIRTHDATES ADDRESSES AND IN SOME CASES DRIVER'S LICENSE. AND ALSO CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THIS BILL AB EIGHTEEN FIFTY NINE WILL REQUIRE A CC ARE A. OF CONDUCTING BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA TO BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT A PATCH OF IT'S A COMPUTER SYSTEM WITHIN THREE DAYS. AND THEN COMPLETE THE SOFTWARE UPDATE WITHIN THE MOST EXPEDIENT TIME POSSIBLE ARE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRIES FOR OUR BEST PRACTICES. BUT NO LONGER THAN THIRTY DAYS. IF IT IS SUBJECT TO A VULNERABILITY THAT POSES A SIGNIFICANT RISK TO THAT SECURITY OF COMPUTERIZED DATA CONTAINING PERSONAL INFORMATION. IF A CCR A FAILED TO PASSED ITS SYSTEM IN A DATA BREACH OCCURS. THE BILL WOULD ALLOW A RESIDENT OF CALIFORNIA WHOSE INFORMATION WAS COMPROMISED TO BRING A CIVIL ACTION TO RECOVER DAMAGES FOR HIS OR HER INJURIES ARE CIVIL. PENALTIES AND ALSO REASONABLE ATTORNEYS FEES AND COSTS THAT WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE. THANK YOU IT WHEN IT SUPPORTS. OH YEAH. GOOD MORNING DANIELLE CANDLE BECAUSE OUR ON BEHALF OF PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IS SEEING NONE IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION. MY IN GRAMMYS FAILURE OF CALIFORNIA AS THE ANNOUNCES NOTES WE DON'T HAVE A POSITION ON THE BELL WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMENDMENTS NOTED THEN THE ANALYSIS AND WE CONTINUE. TO LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO STRENGTHEN THE PROTECTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE BELL. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY POLIQUIN BEHALF THE CONSUMER DATA INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. WHICH REPRESENTS ABOUT A HUNDRED CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE UNITED STATES INCLUDING THE THREE NATIONAL CREDIT BUREAUS. I FIRST WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND COMMITTEE CONSULTANT FOR MEETING WITH US TO DISCUSS YOUR CONCERNS WITH THE LEGISLATION. AS AN INDUSTRY WE TAKE SERIOUSLY THE PREACHERS THAT OCCUR TO OUR SYSTEMS AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE INVESTIGATION OF EQUIFAX BY THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION. THE CONSUMER FINANCE PROTECTION BUREAU AND CONGRESS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND WHAT WENT WRONG AND TO ENSURE THAT SOMETHING LIKE THIS CAN BE PREVENTED IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY THE GRAMM LEACH BLILEY ACT REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ENSURE THE SECURITY AND CONFIDENTIALITY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION. AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GOP ACT THAT TO SEE ISSUES SAFEGUARD RULES WHICH REQUIRES FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UNDER FTC JURISDICTION TO HAVE MEASURES IN PLACE. TO KEEP CUSTOMER INFORMATION SECURE. THE CREDIT REPORTING INDUSTRY ALSO FOLLOWS GOOD BUSINESS PRACTICES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE NATIONAL INSTITUTE OF STANDARDS AND TECHNOLOGY AMONG OTHER NATIONAL STANDARDS. THIS IS IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND AS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY ALL THE CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS IS CONSISTENT WITH THESE PRACTICES AND ASSIST IN PREVENTING PREACHES. RATHER THAN EXPOSING OUR SYSTEM TO OTHER POTENTIAL SECURITY VULNERABILITIES. WE UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF ADDRESSING SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT EACH OF THE VULNERABILITIES HAVE TO BE ASSESSED TO RISK AS WELL. WE APPRECIATE THAT SOME WOMEN'S WILLINGNESS TO FURTHER DISCUSS PRIORITIZING OUR SECURITY RISK. WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WITH OTHER PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. THE CIVIC WAY THE BILL REQUIRES THAT WE SHALL BEGIN TO IMPLEMENT A SOFTWARE UPDATES OR PATCH WITHIN THREE DAYS. WE BELIEVE. THE WORD EMPLOYMENT NEEDS TO BE FURTHER TO. A FINE THE MEAN ASSETS A TO IT ASSESS PLAN AND TEST AS THAT IS A PROCESS THAT TAKES PLACE BEFORE PATCH CAN BEGIN TO BE IMPLEMENTED. WE ARE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THERE COULD BE GOT COMPLICATIONS MANDATING A TIME FRAME THE THIRTY DAYS WITHOUT FLEXIBILITY. FOR EXAMPLE WHAT IF WE FIND OUT THAT A PACK OR SECURITY UPDATE HAD THE BILL THE PROBLEM NAY NEW PATCH OR UPDATE IS NOT READY AT THAT TIME. I WAS STILL OBLIGATED TO AND IT INSTALL THAT PATCH OR UPDATE WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. IN ADDITION THERE HAVE BEEN TIMES IN A SOFTWARE UPDATE OUR PATCH IS NOT OF THE APPROPRIATE RECOURSE BUT UNDER THIS BILL IT IS MANDATED. FINALLY WHEN THE MOST TROUBLING PROVISIONS OF THE BILL IS A CIVIL PENALTY OF FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS FOR EACH PERSON WHOSE INFORMATION COULD BE POTENTIALLY COMPROMISED WITHOUT SHOWING ANY INJURY. WHAT THE ANALYSIS STATED THAT THIS AMOUNT WOULD BE REASONABLE I WOULD SUGGEST OTHERWISE? THINK ABOUT IT WHAT IF WE TAKE THAT BUT FAX EXAMPLE. AND TAKE TEN PERCENT OF THE RECORD RELEASE SAYS CALIFORNIA SHARE. AND ONLY TEN PERCENT OF THOSE PEOPLE FILE TO RECOVER THE FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. THIS WOULD AMOUNT TO A COST OF SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS. THIS IS OVER A QUARTER OF EQUIFAX'S MARKET CAP. THIS PROVISION HAS THE ABILITY TO BANKRUPT COMPANIES. SHOULD THE SAME STANDARD APPLIED TO OUR SCHOOL SYSTEMS UNIVERSITY SYSTEM CITY COUNTIES IN THE STATE. I WOULD THINK NOT BECAUSE THAT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT AND BECAUSE THEY WOULD HAVE TO EACH OF THOSE. THAT'S THE OF ORGANIZATION'S I SHOULD STATE AND GOVERNMENT. CURRENTLY THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS AND OTHER ACTIONS WHICH WE BELIEVE ARE THE PROPER REMEDY. FOR THESE REASONS WE STILL MUST I RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THIS BILL BUT CONTINUE TO WORK WITH A MEMBER IN TRYING TO RESOLVE OUR CONCERNS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. VERY BRIEFLY MISTER CHAIR I'VE BEEN ASKED BY THE CIVIL JUSTICE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA I'M MIKE BELOW TO INDICATE THEY ARE OPPOSED WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THE CIVIL LIABILITY. PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. THANK YOU. YOU SHOULD CHAIR MEMBERS PAUL LET FILTER REPRESENTING EXPERIENCE. WITH SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT. MISTER POLLOCK HAD. STATED OF THIS VERY COMPLEX AREA THINK WE ALL WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET IT RIGHT NOW WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE. ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHALLENGE THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU. NO ONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. SINGH NANDA BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SUCH I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE SWORD I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS WITH THAT. AND WITH RESPECT TO. SOME OF THE THE OPPOSITION KIND OF LOOKING TO CONGRESS AND THE FEDERAL. AGENCIES TO HELP ADDRESS THIS THERE DOESN'T SEEM TO BE IN SOME WAYS A LOT OF PROGRESS BEING MADE THERE YET WE ARE LEFT IN CALIFORNIA. TRYING TO PROTECT. OUR OWN INDIVIDUALS AND AND FOLKS WHO HAVE WHO HAVE SUFFERED IN POTENTIALLY SUFFER SIGNIFICANTLY. FROM SOME OF THAT THE DATA BREACHES AND OFTENTIMES COMPANIES DON'T TAKE IT VERY SERIOUSLY TOO OFTEN THERE WAS A PATCH OF. WELL THAT WASN'T IMPLEMENTED AND I'D. I UNDERSTAND THE ISSUE BECAUSE ARE OFTEN PATCHES THAT ARE QUITE AS STABLE I WOULD HOPE COMPANIES WOULD WOULD NOT RELEASED SOFTWARE PATCHES THAT THAT HAVE NOT BEEN ADEQUATELY TESTED. BUT IN AN ENTERPRISE ROUND THAT OFTEN SOMETIMES IS AN ISSUE AND SO MAYBE THERE IS THERE IS SOME FLEXIBILITY THERE OR WERE WAYS TO ADDRESS THAT IF A LARGE ENTERPRISE. DOES HAVE THE ABILITY TO. TO TEST AND AND UNDERSTAND THAT IF THEY ARE RAISING THAT ISSUE. THE COMPANY RESPONSIBLE FOR THAT FOR THAT PATCH NEED TO TAKE THAT SERIOUSLY AND GET. A REPLACEMENT IN AND AND ULTIMATELY SOLVE THAT PROBLEM. BUT TO JUST IGNORE UPGRADING SOFTWARE IS APPROPRIATE TO NOT TAKE AN APPROPRIATE STEP WHEN THERE'S AN A A VULNERABILITY THAT HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED. SHOULD NO LONGER BE EXCUSABLE BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT COMES UP AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AND IN THE EQUIFAX ROUND WE KEEP LEARNING. AND SO MANY COMPANIES THAT JUST WANNA SAY LOOK THIS REALLY ISN'T OUR PROBLEM AND FACT ARE LOBBYING THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT NOW FOR COMPLETE COMMUNITIES? FROM THESE KINDS OF THESE KINDS OF BRIDGES AND YET THERE'S REAL COST INDIVIDUALS TO OUR CONSTITUENTS. WHEN THERE'S A BREACH AND THAT INFORMATION GETS AROUND IT'S IT'S A VERY VERY SERIOUS ISSUE BUT IT IS COMPLEX AND. AS CHAIRMAN OF YOUR COMMITTEE I KNOW THIS IS THAT YOU ARE ABSOLUTELY TAKING SERIOUSLY AND AND WORKING ON. NOT ANY EASY ANSWERS I'M HOPING THAT THIS BILL DOES MOVE FORWARD THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THE THAT THE DISCUSSION ABOUT SOME OF THE CHALLENGES THAT ARE RAISED HERE. AND WHAT'S APPROPRIATE FOR CALIFORNIA AS WE SEEK TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS IN A MUCH LARGER QUESTION AND A MUCH LARGER PICTURE SO I I APPRECIATE THIS BILL. AND I DO HOPE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO MOVE IT THE RECOMMENDATION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SEE NOW I'M LOOKING FOR A MOTION. MOTION AND A SECOND THANK YOU. CHAU. WITH A THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF MISS CHAIR FOR YOUR COMMENTS AS WELL ULTIMATELY ME CLOSE BY. STATING THAT I WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION IN FACT THAT. YOU KNOW I'M I'M OPEN TO ON. TWEETING OR FINE TUNING SOME OF THE LANGUAGE INCLUDING THE WORD IMPLEMENT I THINK THE INTENT THERE IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE GET THE BALL ROLLING ONCE. ONCE THE ENTITY FINDS OUT THAT THERE'S OF ON ABILITY AND THERE'S A FIX TO GET THE BALL ROLLING WHETHER IT'S THREE DAYS OR WHATEVER IT THE DAY IT IS. ARE WE REMAIN VERY FLEXIBLE ON SOME OF THE. YOU KNOW THE SUGGESTIONS BEING MADE THE REALITY IS THAT WE WE HAVE HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN MILLION PEOPLE IS INFORMATION THAT'S BEING COMPROMISED. AND YES THERE ARE A FEDERAL LAWS OUT THERE THAT PROTECT US ALL CERTAIN ALL INFORMATION BUT YET THERE'S NONE OF THOSE LAWS ACTUALLY PERTAIN TO APPLYING ANY PATCHES. AND THERE'S NO TIMELINE AS WELL SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO TO FORCE TO ESTABLISH SOME KIND OF TIME LINE SAY THAT THE COMPANIES ARE YOU KNOW THEY HAVE A GOT YOU KNOW BASICALLY SOME SOME. YOU KNOW VERY HARD CRITERIA TO THE BASICALLY BASICALLY TO COMPLY WITH THE LAW SO. AND THEY ARE YOU KNOW AND IT ALSO THERE'S LANGUAGE IN THERE THAT SAYS THAT ONCE A VULNERABILITY HAS HAS BEEN DISCOVERED AND THEY. ARE THEY ARE REQUIRED TO START ASSESSING THE SITUATION SO THERE'S NO NEED FOR HIM TO ACTUALLY START IMPLEMENTING AND TOLD THEIR SUSSMAN IS FINISHED WITH. SO DOING GOT ASSESSMENT PERIOD THEY COULD EVALUATE WHETHER OR NOT THAT PATCH IS ACTUALLY SUITABLE OR APPROPRIATE FOR THAT PARTICULAR SYSTEM SO THERE'S A LITTLE BIT OF OF THE WAY THERE AS WELL SO PAY THE PROMISE IS BASICALLY TO YOU ALL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OPPOSITION AND THEN HOPEFULLY I WILL HAVE AYE ABOVE FINAL A PRODUCT THAT'S. ACCEPTABLE TO EVERYBODY THANK YOU. THANK YOU. TO TELL MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED CALL THE ROLL PLEASE STONE BY STONE AYE CUNNINGHAM. CHAU AYE CHAU AYE CHIU. IF YOU AYE GONZALEZ FLETCHER GONZALEZ FLETCHER AYE HOLDEN. HOLDEN I KALRA. KALRA AYE KILEY. KILEY NO MAIENSCHEIN. MAIENSCHEIN AYE RADIUS. REYES I. THAT BILL IS OUT. THANK YOU. AS HE WAS SITTING MISTER CUNNINGHAM ARE YOU READY YET TO PRESENTS. SO WE'LL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER SIXTEEN AB THREE OH FOUR ONE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN BIRDS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB. THIRTY FORTY ONE AND WITH ME TODAY IS MISTER CHRISTOPHER CARLISLE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND. AND LEXI HOWARD WITH THE CALIFORNIA ESCROW ASSOCIATION. PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES ARE GENERALLY IMPOSED BY DEVELOPERS AND THEY REQUIRE. THE INITIAL HOME THANK YOU PROTECT THEIR HOME BUYER AND ALL SUBSEQUENT PRECURSORS TO PAY A FEE UPON TRANSFER. BASED ON A PERCENTAGE OF THE SALE PRICE IN SOME AGREES EXAMPLES. THESE FEES CAN BE UP TO TWO PERCENT OF PURCHASE PRICE OF A HOMER SIXTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME TEN THOUSAND FOR FIVE AND THOUSAND DOLLAR HOME. THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE SEEING IS UNDER FEDERAL LAW PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES THAT DO NOT. PROVIDE A QUOTE UNQUOTE DIRECT BENEFIT AS THAT PHRASE IS DEFINED IN FEDERAL LAW. CAN ACTUALLY DISQUALIFY BUYERS FOR BEING ABLE TO QUALIFY FOR FREDDIE MAC. THIS REDUCES OPPORTUNITY FOR BUYERS AND CAN CAUSE VERY UNWELCOME SURPRISES DURING ESCROW. FOR BOTH BUYERS SELLERS. THIS BILL WOULD SIMPLY PROHIBIT THE IMPOSITION OF PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES THAT DO NOT PROVIDE. A DIRECT BENEFIT AS THE FINE IN FEDERAL LAW IT WILL LINE CALIFORNIA WITH FORTY THREE OTHER STATES THAT ALREADY PROHIBIT THIS. BILL PROTECT BUYERS AND SELLERS AND I'D LIKE TO NOTE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT UNDER TWELVES CFR TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT POINT ONE. WHICH IS THE FEDERAL CODE THAT DEFINES DIRECT BENEFIT. A DIRECT BENEFIT. DOES INCLUDE. A CULTURAL EDUCATIONAL CHARITABLE RECREATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL. AND CONSERVATION TYPE ACTIVITIES SO I DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE A POSITION TODAY BUT I THINK THAT FEDERAL LAW. AND DEFINITION DIRECT BENEFIT ADDRESSES THE CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED TO US PREVIOUSLY I THINK THIS BILL IS VERY SUPPORTABLE AT. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE. THANK YOU FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT CHRIS FOR CARLA WITH VIA CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS FOR STUFF I WANT TO THANK YOUR. CONSULTANT FOR THE VERY. PLEASE ANALYSIS WITH REGARD TO THE ISSUES RELATED TO A PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES. LAST YEAR WE SPONSORED A BILL WITH ASSEMBLY WOMAN REYES TO ALERT FOLKS TO THE FACT OF THE. FEDERAL PROHIBITION ON. GOVERNOR FINANCING FOR PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES THAT DID NOT PROVIDE A DIRECT BENEFIT SOMEONE CUNNINGHAM MENTIONED WHERE. YOU CAN HAVE INSTANCES WHERE SOMEBODY'S LOOKING TO BUY A PLACE ONLY TO FIND THAT THEY CAN'T GET FINANCING. THE OTHER ALTERNATIVE IS WERE YOU MAYBE HAVE AN ALL CASH BUYER AND THEY COME IN WHEN THAT INDIVIDUAL GOES TO SELL THEIR NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO. I THINK ABOUT BEING A BLIND TO GET BYERS BECAUSE THEIR BUYERS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET GOVERNMENT FINANCING. SO FOR THOSE REASONS. WE THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO BAN THESE ON A GO FORWARD BASIS SO THIS WOULD BE ONLY FOR PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES. ESTABLISHED AFTER JANUARY ONE OF TWENTY NINETEEN. BAND THOSE BECAUSE GOVERNMENT FINANCING IS NOT AVAILABLE THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT US PLEASE GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS LEXI HOWARD ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ESCROW ASSOCIATION OUR MEMBERS ARE THE ONES WHO MEET WITH BUYERS AND SELLERS. WHEN THEY ARE SELLING AND BUYING THE PROPERTY THEY ARE ROUTINELY SURPRISED BY PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES WE APPRECIATE THE WORK OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER. RAYOS. LAST YEAR ON THIS WE THINK THAT DOING THIS PROSPECTIVELY ADDS PREDICTABILITY TO THE PROCESS IN A WAY THAT IS APPROPRIATE AND RESPECTFUL OF BUYERS AND SELLERS. RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR APPLAUSE THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. SEEING NONE OPPOSITION. INSERT. GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I'M VICTORIA ROMAN WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WERE NOT IN OPPOSITION BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO JUST RAISE A COUPLE CONCERNS. AND I DO APOLOGIZE THAT WERE LATE TO THE TABLE WE'VE ONLY JUST BEEN MADE AWARE OF THE BILL. BUT. WE WE DO WANT TO MAKE SURE WORTH WERE FOUNDING MEMBERS OF THE TO HONE CONSERVANCY AGREEMENT WHICH WAS A LANDMARK AGREEMENT BETWEEN. LANDOWNERS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND BUSINESSES TO MAKE SURE THAT AS THE TELEPHONE RANCH DEVELOPMENT MOVE FORWARD THAT THERE WAS CONSERVATION OF THE SPECIAL. IMPORTANT LANDS AROUND THE AREA AND PART OF HOW THAT WAS FUNDED WAS WITH PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES AND MY UNDERSTANDING WHILE WE APPRECIATE THAT IT'S NOT THE AUTHOR'S INTENT TO. COVER THAT TYPE OF FEE I THINK THAT THERE COULD BE SOME UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AS OR TRYING TO. CODIFY A FEDERAL RULING INTO STATE LAW AND SO WE JUST WANT TO CONTINUE. TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH OTHER STAKEHOLDERS. AND OTHER CONSERVATION GROUPS AND MAKE SURE THAT IF THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD THAT IT'S NOT INADVERTENTLY PROHIBITING THE THAT TYPE OF FEET. EVEN THOUGH IT IS PERSPECTIVE MY UNDERSTANDING THAT IS THAT AS A HOME IS SOLD IN THIS. DEVELOPMENT BUT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED CREATED HAVING CREATED A FEE AND SO COULD PROHIBIT. FEES EVEN IN THE TONE RANCH AGREEMENT. GOING FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. QUAN OF LET ME DONE WITHOUT ABOUT CALIFORNIA ALSO VARIOUS. BUT WE I'D LIKE PEOPLE. ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH. MY COLLEAGUES AT. THAT MY COLLEAGUE MADE WITH AN RTC ALSO WANT TO BE. MINDFUL THAT WE ARE LATE TO. THE TABLE AND WANT ONE APOLOGIZED NOT ONLY TO THE COMMITTEE BUT ALSO TO THE AUTHOR FOR THIS. LATE TODD CONCERNED WE ARE NOT TAKING A POSITION TODAY. WE WANT TO DO. REGISTER CONCERNS ARE VERY SIMILAR IN THE SAME VEIN THAT. MISS OUR ROME. SUGGESTED WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE MITIGATION THAT MAY OCCUR ON LANDS THAT ARE NOT IMMEDIATELY ADJACENT OR SERVICE. SERVING THE FACTOR COMMUNITY ARE AND IN SPECIFICALLY IT THAT. WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL'S DEFINITION OF DIRECT BENEFIT. OF THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THE USE OF FEES TO BE USED FOR A TO FIND ADDITIONAL MITIGATION. YOU AND WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS PROBLEMATIC SPECIFICALLY AS IT RELATES TO OUR AREAS. FOR. VOLUNTARY MITIGATION OF PROGRAM THAT WE OWE WE'VE HELPED US CREATE LAST YEAR OR TWO YEARS AGO ARE A WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE AB TWENTY EIGHTY SEVEN THAT WOULD. HELP CREATE. MITIGATION IN AREAS THAT WOULD NOT NECESSARILY BE ADJACENT TO. YOU KNOW WHERE THE IMPACT IS AND SO WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THROUGH A LOT TO THAT THROUGH THESE ISSUES. ARMED BUT. UNDERSTAND THAT. WE WORK HERE LATER THAN. WE WHAT I. WANTED TO REALLY THANK YOU THANK YOU OTHERS IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT THING THEN WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE AND JUST EXPLAIN THE COMMITTEE WE HAD PUT THIS ON CONSENT THIS COMMITTEE HAS A BIT OF HISTORY. WITH THIS ISSUE AND. FOR MOST OF THESE FEES IT IT'S REALLY THAT. THE DEVELOPER WHO THEN CREATES A STRUCTURE TO GET REIMBURSED OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND THAT BECOMES. UNFAIR AND FUTURE BUYERS OF THESE PROPERTIES WE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THAT HE IS THERE AND THAT THEY'RE PAYING INTO IT THAT'S SORT OF. IN ITS WORST. CONTEXT. THAT FEDERAL LAW AND WE'RE NOT REALLY CODIFYING A FEDERAL PROGRAM HERE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS TRYING TO PROTECT AGAINST. THESE KINDS A FEES CROPPING UP AND HAVING THIS UNKNOWN UNKNOWABLE. PROCESS THAT NOW. WHEN DAY TRANSACTION HAPPENS AND AND A NEW HOME WAS FOR A HOME IS BEING SOLD. THAT THAT FEE CROPS UP AND ALL OF A SUDDEN THERE'S THERE'S AN OBLIGATION TO PAY. BUT BECAUSE OF. THE FEDERAL STATUTE I THINK THE. ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS IN THE IN THE ISSUES OF FUNDING SIGNIFICANT PROJECTS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT THIS BILL IS IS ULTIMATELY GOING AFTER AN ADDRESS BUT YOUR CONCERNS ARE WELL TAKEN I THINK WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR. TO ENSURE THAT WERE VERY CLEAR ABOUT HOW THAT HAPPENS ANYTHING THAT HAPPENED IN THE PAST IS NOT REALLY OF THIS IS PROSPECTIVE AND I BECAUSE THAT STRUCTURE IS IN PLACE IN THE HOME RANCH I DON'T KNOW THAT. THIS WOULD INTERFERE WITH WITH AS THOSE HOMES OF SOUL BECAUSE THAT'S AN OBLIGATION THAT. RUNS ESSENTIALLY WITH AWAY AND BUT IT'S WORTH ASKING THE QUESTION AND IT'S WORTH CLARIFYING AS WE MOVE THROUGH IT AND SOME OF THE AUTHOR IS. FINE WITH THAT BUT I JUST WANTED TO EXPLAIN WHY. THIS WAS. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO DEAL WITH IN CALIFORNIA SO WE DON'T HAVE THE CITY'S CROPPING UP BUT STILL ALLOW FOR. WHAT THE FEDERAL LAW ALLOWS FOR AND THAT IS TO BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME BROADER COMMUNITY BENEFIT? IN THROUGH MITIGATION FEES ARE ONGOING MITIGATION FEES AS PROPERTIES MOVE THAT'S WHAT WAS CONTEMPLATED THAT'S A STRUCTURE THINK WE WANT TO MAINTAIN A THROUGH THROUGH BILL BUT THEN GET RID OF THESE. UNKNOWN. WHERE THERE REALLY IS NO COMMUNITY BENEFIT THERE'S NO PUBLIC BENEFIT THERE'S NO IT'S JUST SOMEBODY WHO WHO FIGURED OUT HOW TO BUILD INTO THE STRUCTURE? BUY SELL THIS HOUSE AND IF ANYBODY EVER CELLS THIS HOUSE I'M GONNA GET SOMETHING IN MY POCKETBOOK. THAT. NO BE WOULD REASONABLY UNDERSTAND. SO THAT'S WHAT OF FULL LEYVA LANDS AND. THAT THE OPPOSITION I THINK OR. THE QUESTIONS ARE ARE VALUABLE AND THEN MAKING SURE THAT WE. THAT THIS BILL IS IS IS APPROPRIATE IN ITS CONSTRUCT BUT THAT'S WHY THIS COMMITTEE THE ANALYSIS IS WHAT IT IS I THINK THIS IS A VERY APPROPRIATE BELL JUST. CLEARING UP THE ISSUE ON THE CITY'S IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD NEED TO DO BUT ALLAY THE CONCERNS OF OF THE PUBLIC BENEFITS THAT DERIVE FROM PAST FEES AND AND HOW THAT STRUCTURE. WE DON'T WANT TO FRUSTRATE FEDERAL. THE FEDERAL. STRUCTURE THAT WAS PUT. OTHER QUESTIONS HOUSE WAS THAT YOU. THANK MISTER CHAIR I'M GENERALLY SUPPORT OF OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO I WANNA JUST GIVE THE AUTHOR AN OPPORTUNITY. NOW OR I OR ANY OF THE SPONSORS AN OPPORTUNITY TO RESPOND TO THE CONCERNS OF BEEN RAISED I. I I WOULD GUESS THAT THE AUTHOR DID NOT HAVE ANY INTENT OF TRYING TO UNDERMINE THE ENVIRONMENTAL MEDICATIONS THAT WERE LAID OUT IN. IN THE PROPOSED PLAN THAT WAS DISCUSSED. OR TO IMPACT THOSE SORTS OF ISSUES MORE BROADLY BUT IF YOU COULD JUST TAKE A MOMENT AND EXPLAIN YOUR INTENT AND AND AND I KNOW YOU HAVE A COMMITMENT TO WORKING WITH. WITH SOME OF THESE PARTIES TO RESOLVE THE LANGUAGE SO IT CLEARLY DOES DOES WHAT WE ALL WANTED TO DO. YES THANK YOU SO A COUPLE POINTS ON THAT I DON'T THINK. PEOPLE SHOULD BE WORRIED THAT THIS IS THIS BILL WOULD IN ANY WAY FRUSTRATE WHAT TOWN RANCHER ANYBODY ELSE IS TRYING TO DO IN TERMS OF. CONSERVATION AND THOSE SORTS OF THINGS. UP BECAUSE AT THE FEDERAL STATUTE WHICH DEFINES WELL REGULATION THAT THE FINES DIRECT BENEFIT. WE CAN'T REALLY. ALTER THAT BECAUSE IF WE DO. WE CHANGE THE LANGUAGE OF IT AND STATE LAW WE COULD BE IN A SITUATION OR FANNIE MAE AND FREDDIE MAC ARE. ARE NOT TAKING THAT IS VALID AND THEN WE HAVEN'T CURED THE PROBLEM AND THE PROBLEM IS THAT HOME BUYERS AND SELLERS THAT OUR UNSUSPECTING. FIGURE OUT. IN THE PROCESS THAT THEY CAN'T QUALIFY FOR LENDING. THAT'S BACKED BY BY FANNIE AND FREDDIE SO BUT BUT THAT DEFINITION. IS IT IS. IT'S PROVIDED OF DIRECT BENEFIT INCLUDES ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION CONDUCTED IN OR PROTECT THE BURNED COMMUNITY OR ADJACENT CONTIGUOUS PROPERTIES I DON'T THINK THE DEFINITIONS COULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR. INCORPORATING SOME SORT OF. EASE MENTOR WHATEVER IT WOULD BE THAT RUNS WITH THE LAND THAT. PROVIDES FOR THE MAINTENANCE OF A COMMUNITY PARK FOR EXAMPLE OR CONSERVATION OF OPEN SPACE OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. I I I DON'T THINK I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS I APPRECIATE YOU GUYS. RAISING THAT BUT I I DON'T THINK. WHAT WE'RE REALLY SIMPLY TRYING TO DO IS? EXACTLY WHAT THE CHAIR SAID AS. BAN PRIVATE TRANSFER FEES IN CALIFORNIA. LIKE FORTY OF THE FORTY THREE OTHER STATES HAVE DONE. THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY JUST DEFERRED PROFIT FOR BUILDERS THAT THEY GET TWO PERCENT OF THE SALE. IN PERPETUITY EVERYTIME THE THE PROPERTIES TURNED OVER. AND THERE'S REALLY THAT DOESN'T GO TO ANYTHING THAT'S BENEFICIAL FOR ANY HOMEOWNER AND REALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING AND. AS I GOT INTO THIS ISSUE AND STUDY THAT I THINK IT'S A. IT IT'S A PRETTY BIG PROBLEM. IN TERMS OF. PROTECTING BUYERS AND SELLERS. AND THEN I THINK THE WITNESS HAD SOME COMMENTS ON THE IDEA I JUST WANTED TO ADD THAT THE BILL OF SPEAKS TO A PUBLIC TRANSIT FEES ESTABLISHED. AFTER JANUARY ONE TWENTY NINETEEN. NOW I THINK THE POINT THAT THE OPPONENTS OF RAISING IS AS NOT LAWRENCE. WELK THAT'S RIGHT CONCERNS THAT CERTAIN FATTY FOODS. WHERE? AS A ASSEMBLY MEMBER I CAN EVEN POINT OUT THESE THINGS OPERATE IN PERPETUITY SO I THINK WHAT I HEAR BEING SAID IS THAT WHEN. THIRD GENERATION FOR GENERATION IS THAT BEING ESTABLISHED A NEW. AND IF WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT THAT'S SOMETHING YOU KNOW IT'S ESTABLISHED AT THE OUTSET AND THEN EVERY TIME THAT YOU HAVE A SALE THAT'S NOT REESTABLISHED. IT IT GOES BACK TO THE ORIGINAL DATE. THAT MAKE SOME SENSE YEAH AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT YEAH YEAH THAT IF AND IF WE NEED TO CLARIFY THAT. OKAY AND YEAH BUT I JUST CLARIFY I THINK THAT THE ISSUE IS THAT TO HONE RANCHES YOU NO PHASE DEVELOPMENT AND SO SOME OF THE HOMES HAVE EVEN BEEN BUILT YET. SO IT'S NOT A MATTER OF THE RESALE IT'S THE FACT THAT AS THEY ARE SOLD WITH THIS IMPACT FEET RIGHT AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT FEE IS TIED TO A SPECIFIC DATE. PRIOR TO THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS. SO THAT PROGRAM WAS CREATED. BEFOREHAND SO EVEN IF THAT PROPERTY WHICH IS SUBJECT TO THE FEE GET SUBDIVIDED AND SO THAT PROGRAM IS IS ALREADY IN PLACE BUT EVEN STILL BECAUSE OF THE BENEFIT. I'M NOT SURE THAT. THIS BILL WOULD APPLY IN THAT CASE EVEN IF IT IS SET UP BUT THAT'S A QUESTION. THAT'S A LEGITIMATE QUESTION AND YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT YOU GET SATISFIED. I THINK WE'RE PRETTY I THINK WERE OKAY I THINK MISTER CUNNINGHAM SPILL THINGS ARE TO BE OUT OF THE DRESSING THAT'S ABOUT WHAT. WE. IT'S WORTH MAKING SURE. WITH IT AS LONG AS WE DON'T FRUSTRATE THE OVERALL PURPOSE OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT I THINK I THINK. THOSE CONCERNS ARE. ARE VALID AND WE'RE HAPPY TO LOOK AT THE SPECIFIC CASE THAT YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT MY THINK ROCCA. OR OTHER QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS.

ANTHEA HER TAVY EXECUTOR TO THE CALIFORNIA CIRCLE SOCIETY ON BEHALF OF OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN OUR STUFF I'M DEEPLY HONORED. TO BE HERE TO SUPPORT ASSEMBLY MEMBER TAINTS AJ ARE THIRTY SIX. THE DESIGNATION OF SIXTH OF MAY TWENTY EIGHTEEN MARKING THE ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX ANNIVERSARY OF PRESIDENT AUTHORS. SIGNING OF A CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT IN EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT OF CALIFORNIA AND THE NATION'S REMEMBRANCE OF A HEINOUS TARGETED. RACIALLY MOTIVATED STAIN ON OUR STE NATION'S HISTORY. CALIFORNIA REGRETTABLY TOOK BELIEVE IN THIS RACIAL TARGETING THAT RESULTED IN THE UNJUST DENIAL OF CHINESE AMERICANS THEIR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS AND PROHIBITING THEIR PATH TO CITIZENSHIP. IMPORTANTLY THEIR RESISTANCE TO THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT GIVES US HOPE AS IT WAS BRAVE STRATEGIC AND SUSTAINED AS AS OURS. THE FACT THAT OUR CURRENT PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION HAS ISSUED MULTIPLE EXECUTIVE ORDERS TARGETING SPECIFIC COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ESPECIALLY THE MUSLIM COMMUNITY. ONCE AGAIN PUTS US AS A NATION ON THE WRONG SIDE OF HISTORY. THE LINK BETWEEN RACIAL AND RELIGIOUS ANIMOSITIES THAT DRIVE THE PRESIDENT'S EXECUTIVE ORDERS. AND THE CHINESE EXCLUSION ACT OF EIGHTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS DIRECT AND IRREFUTABLE. AJ ARE THIRTY SIX RIGHTFULLY CALLS ON THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION TO REPEAL THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS.

AUTHORED THIS I REPRESENT THE OLDEST CHINATOWN IN OUR COUNTRY. IN SAN FRANCISCO'S CHINATOWN AND HE REPRESENTS OUR WEBSITE NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE WASN'T LONG AGO THAT THERE WERE. A ANTI CHINESE RACIAL PROPERTY COVENANTS THAT PREVENTED SOMEONE LIKE PHIL TING FROM ACTUALLY OWNING PROPERTY IN THE WEST SIDE OF SAN ISCO. ARE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS VERY TIMELY GIVEN WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE NATIONAL CLIMATE TENDA. APPRECIATED WHAT SUPPORT PART. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE. AND THOSE WHO THINK THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I WILL NOTE THE FIRST CHINESE VILLAGE ON THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA WAS IN PACIFIC GROVE WHO'S A CHINESE FISHING VILLAGE. WE THINK OF MONTEREY HAVING BEEN. A FISHING VILLAGE ESTABLISHED BY ITALIAN IMMIGRANTS IT WAS ACTUALLY CHINESE AND THEY BOTH RECENTLY HAVE FOUND SOME EVIDENCE OF THAT VILLAGE. AND PART OF THE REASON THAT IT SEEMS NEW AND PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND WAS BECAUSE OF THE REPRESSION. OF THAT INFORMATION AND THEY WERE NOT ALWAYS WELCOME BUT THERE ARE NUMBER DESCENDANTS OF. THOSE CHINESE FISHERMEN WHO CAME ALL THE WAY OVER TO THE MONTEREY BAY AND STARTED THE FISHING INDUSTRY THAT. HAS GONE THROUGH A LOT OF CHANGES OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS SO THAT THE HISTORY IS IMPORTANT FOR US TO UNDERSTAND THE CONTRIBUTIONS OF. THE CHINESE WHO DID COME OVER TO THIS COUNTRY EVEN EARLIER THAN WE HAD PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. ARE ARE VERY NOTABLE SO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. THINKING MAKES EVEN MORE PROUD TO HAVE GOTTEN MARRIED THE PACIFIC GROVE. SO THERE YOU VERY. FEW ALRIGHT. THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS.
