I DON'T FEEL LIKE I'VE IT WAS BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE A FULL DAY -- FOLLOWED BY A LOT OF FOLKS AND THAT'S A GOOD THING. AND YOU KNOW SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT. THE FUTURE OF WORK AND WORKPLACE INNOVATION -- WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT HOW THE LAW DEFINES A WORKER AND THE REASONING. OF THE COURT IN ESTABLISHING THE A. B. C. TESTING DYNAMAX -- SEEKS TO CREATE A SIMPLER AND CLEARER STANDARD OF WHO AN EMPLOYEE IS FOR BASIC WAGE OVERTIME PROTECTIONS. I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE THAT CLARITY ON HOW THE CLASS I WORKERS IMPORTANT SO THAT EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES ALIKE UNDERSTAND THEIR RIGHTS. AND RESPONSIBILITIES ON THE LAW -- HOWEVER -- CONVERSATIONS ON THE FUTURE OF WORK MUST GO BEYOND DEFINING LEGAL DEFINITIONS WORKER MISS CLASSIFICATION IS SIGNIFICANT AND ONGOING ISSUE WITH REAL ECONOMIC A SOCIAL CONSEQUENCES. FOR EVERY DAY WORKING PEOPLE BUT EVEN SEPARATE FROM THIS ONE ISSUE THERE'S A LOT OF CONVERSATIONS WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE -- BOTH EMPLOYERS EMPLOYEES A CERTAINLY FOLKS IN THIS BUILDING IN TERMS LEGISLATORS ON WHAT THE FUTURE OF WORK MEANS AND AND HOW WE BETTER DEFINE IT. AS IT CONTINUES TO CHANGE -- NOW WE'RE NOT HEARING ANY BILL TODAY AND SO I WANNA LET FOLKS MAKING A BIG MAKE THAT CLEAR TO FOLKS THIS IS NOT ABOUT ANY ONE OR NUMBER OF BILLS.

GET TO THAT IS THE NATURE OF WHAT THE LAW WAS WHAT THE LAW IS TODAY -- WITH OR WITHOUT ANY. LEGISLATION AND SO I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S REALLY CLEAR AND THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW THINGS WORK.

THANK YOUS AMERICANS OSSINING COMMENTS AND CARRILLO. READY GO ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU -- AND SO WITH THAT WE WILL HAVE OUR FIRST PANEL ON THIS IS GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT MORE SUBSTANTIVE. AS WE'RE GONNA ALLOW THE PANELISTS I DO ASK ALL THE PANELISTS ON THIS ONE AND AND SUCH COMPOUNDS. TO STICK TO THE ALLOTTED TIME -- BECAUSE WE DO AGAIN HAVE A HAVE A BIG AND TO HELP UNDERSTAND -- WORKER MISS CLASSIFICATION IN GENERAL. AND SO WITH THAT WE HAVE MY ANTHRO MIDTERM STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS DIRECTOR WITH NATIONAL PLAMEN LÃ  PROJECT -- WILL BE FOLLOWED BY RETIRED JUDGE JOHN TROOP. AND PROFESSOR OF BEING A NEW BALL WITH THE UC HASTINGS SCHOOL OF LAW -- AND WE DO HAVE TIME ALLOTTED AFTER THEY ALL SPEAK. FOR A QUESTIONS OF ANY COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS BUT YOU KNOW IF ANYONE HAS A BURNING QUESTION WHILE THEY'RE SPEAKING CERTAINLY FEEL FREE -- TO GOT A CALL THAT TO MY ATTENTION. SO -- MISS MADE THAT PLEASE. DO I NEED TO DO ANYTHING TO THE FRONT. I DON'T KNOW IS IT ON OKAY GREAT OKAY. OKAY GREAT UP THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR INVITING ME TO OPEN THE CONVERSATION TODAY -- MY NAME AGAIN IS NINTH ARMY THE WITH THE NATIONAL IN A LOT PROJECT THEM IN A BERKELEY OFFICE -- NATIONAL WHEN LOW PROJECT OR NOW IS A NATIONAL LEGAL RESEARCH AND POLICY ORGANIZATION WERE BASED IN NEW YORK -- BUT WE HAVE OFFICES IN WATCH WASHINGTON DC HAVE BEEN AT THE END OF THIS IS THE AWKWARDLY CLOSE GREAT BUT OKAY MAKE SURE. TO TO NATIONAL PLAN LET PROJECT NOW BUT IS BASED IN NEW YORK WE HAVE OFFICES IN WASHINGTON DC SEATTLE BERKELEY AND WE WORK ON ISSUES -- POLICIES WE WORK TO ADVANCE POLICIES THAT SUPPORT THE RIGHTS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORKERS IN LOW INCOME JOBS. AND TO STRENGTHEN PROTECTIONS AND HAS BEEN ON THE WAYS THAT EMPLOYERS STRUCTURE WORK ARRANGEMENTS OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP -- FOR EXAMPLE THROUGH SUBCONTRACTING A TEMPER STAFFING AGENCIES FRANCHISEE MODELS OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR INSTRUMENTS ON ON THE REASON WE FOCUS ON THE STRUCTURES IS THAT THEY ARE TOO OFTEN THE DRIVERS OF LABOR STANDARDS EROSION. AT RISING INCOME AND WEALTH INEQUALITY IN DURING ANY INVOLVING A STRUCTURAL RACISM IN OCCUPATIONAL SEGREGATION AND THE SHIFTING OF POWER AWAY FROM WORKERS SO THAT'S OUR ORGANIZATIONAL INTEREST IN THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE -- AND SO I'M GONNA JUST. I'M SURE UP HERE WHAT I'M GONNA COVER IN THE NEXT FEW MINUTES JUST A REALLY BROAD OVERVIEW I HAVE SOME. REPORT A REPORT -- THAT A LOT OF THE THE MATERIAL AND THE PRESENTATION REFERENCES -- WE'VE A LOT MORE RESOURCES ON OUR WEBSITE AND A LOT OF OTHER THERE'S A LOT OF OTHER GREAT RESEARCH ON THESE ON THE TOPIC SOME IS GONNA. GONNA GIVE A BIG PICTURE AROUND WHAT IS MISS CLASSIFICATION AND I'LL SAY WHAT THAT TERM MEANS WHAT ARE THE CONSEQUENCES FOR WORKERS WHEN THEY'RE MISCLASSIFIED WHAT ARE THE COST TO THE ECONOMY. AND THEN WHAT ARE LEGISLATURE'S AGENCIES COURTS DOING TO RESPOND TO THE PROBLEM THIS CLASSIFICATION AND WHERE DOES THE DYNAMICS DECISION FIT WITHIN THAT CONTEXT. I'M SO MISS CLASSIFICATION IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A WORKER IS PUT INTO THE WRONG CATEGORY WHEN THEY ARE IN EMPLOYEE BUT THEIR EMPLOYER CALLS THEM AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR -- AND OFTENTIMES A WORKER IS MADE ME TO AGREE TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS AS A CONDITION OF HAVING THE JOB -- CERTAINLY SOME EMPLOYERS MAY UNINTENTIONALLY CLASSIFY WORKER AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OUT WHEN IN FACT THEY SHOULD BE AN EMPLOYEE -- BUT TOO OFTEN WE SEE IT HIS WORK -- INTENTIONAL EFFORTS BY EMPLOYERS TO EVADE THE LAW -- IN THE PRACTICE IS ALSO SOMETIMES CALLED PAYROLL FRAUD -- BECAUSE THE EMPLOYERS ARE AVOIDING PAYING AND TO PAYROLL TAXES -- AND I'M USING THE TERM MISS CLASSIFICATION HERE WHICH IS KIND OF A TECHNICAL SOUNDING TERM -- AND I'M USING IT THROUGHOUT THE PRESENTATION JUST FOR KIND OF A SHORTHAND -- BUT I JUST WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT IT'S IT. IT SOUNDS MORE TECHNICAL BUT IT REALLY CAN OBSCURE WHAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE FOR WORKERS AND FOR THE ECONOMY -- IT'S NOT JUST A CLERICAL ERROR -- EMPLOYERS IN AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INDUSTRIES ARE CALLING THEIR WORKERS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND WHAT THAT DOES NOT GOING TO LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL IN JUST A MOMENT WHAT THAT DOES IS IT DENIES WORKERS PROTECTIONS. OF WORKPLACE LAWS THAT APPLY TO EMPLOYEES STATUS NOT A MINUTE CONTRACTOR STATUS I'M AND IT DEPRIVES -- SOCIAL SECURITY MEDICARE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WORKER'S COMPENSATION FUNDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND REDUCES FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL TAX REVENUES. THE PARTY TO BENEFIT ARE THE EMPLOYERS WHO GET TO SAVE AS MUCH AS 30% OF PAYROLL AND RELATED TAXES BY CALLING -- BY MISTAKENLY CALLING WORKERS -- INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS INSTEAD OF EMPLOYEES THE BALANCE IS VERY MUCH HARM TO WORKERS -- SHORTCHANGING OUR GOVERNMENT COFFERS BUT ON THE PRACTICE BENEFITS EMPLOYERS -- AN EMPLOYEE MUST MISS CLASSIFICATION IS A PROBLEM ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND IS PARTICULARLY PREVALENT IN CERTAIN INDUSTRIES WHICH YOU CAN SEE HERE HOME CARE JANITORIAL TRACKING CONSTRUCTION -- AND THE US DEPARTMENT OF LABOR HAS FOUND THAT IS MANY IS 30% OF FIRMS MIS CLASSIFIED THEIR EMPLOYEES AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THEN STATE GOVERNMENT STUDIES -- HAVE OFTEN CITED ESTIMATES THAT ARE EVEN HIGHER BUT IT IT IS HARD TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBERS -- AND AS I SAID WE HAVE A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT GO INTO ALL THE STUDIES AND SUMMARIZE THEM AND LOOK AT LOOK AT THEM -- I HAVE ON A STATE BY STATE BASIS. SO OF COURSE THIS IS TOO SMALL FOR PEOPLE TO SEE I'M SURE BUT IT IS A SCREEN SHOT FROM THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER REPORT THAT LOOKED AT COMMON OCCUPATIONS HELD BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AS THEIR MAIN JOB IN CALIFORNIA. AND SO. AGAIN MAYBE STILL TOO SMALL BUT WHAT YOU SEE THERE IS THE BOTTOM OF THAT LIST WHICH ARE HIGH WAGE UP PROFESSIONS AD WHERE WHERE THE PEOPLE IN THIS PROFESSIONS ARE TYPICALLY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS LIKE DOCTORS AND ENGINEERS AND PSYCHIATRISTS. AND FRANKLY WE'RE NOT REALLY THAT CONCERNED IT ABOUT THEM BEING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THEY HAVE -- THE RESOURCES AND THE BARGAINING POWER AND CAN MAKE THE DECISION TO ENTER INTO THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THAT THE TYPES OF JOBS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT -- WHERE LOOPS EXCUSE ME AND I'M SORRY IS SO SMALL -- THE LOW WAGE POSITIONS. WHERE WORKERS ARE TYPICALLY CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- SO YOU YOU MAY SEE -- IF YOU HAVE REALLY GREAT VISION. THAT. THE SAME GROUPS THAT ARE LISTED HERE THE LOW WAGE PROFESSIONS LOW AND MIDDLE WHICH PROFESSIONS THAT ARE -- THAT WHERE PEOPLE ARE TYPICALLY IN A CONTRACTORS JANITORS HOME CARE WORKERS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS TRUCK DRIVERS. WHICH ARE. IN AS YOU MAY REMEMBER FOR THE PREVIOUS SLIDE THOSE ARE PROFESSIONS THOSE ARE ROLES WHERE A LOT OF WORKERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED -- SO AGAIN JUST I'M I'M SHOWING YOU THE SLIDE TO SHOW THAT THERE'S A RAIL WIDE RANGE IN WHO IS CLASSIFIED AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND WHAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IN PARTICULAR ARE. THOSE WORKERS WHO ARE IN POSITIONS WHERE THEY OFTEN HAVE NO CHOICE ON THEY DON'T NECESSARILY HAVE ACCESS TO ALL OF THE INFORMATION ON THE TRUSTS WHEN THEIR EMPLOYERS TELL THEM THAT THEY'RE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- BUT THE CONSEQUENCE ON PROTECTIONS OUR WHOLE I'M OF WORKPLACE RIGHT [inaudible] TO DEPENDS AN EMPLOYEE. AT SO THE TWO CLASSIFICATIONS OF COURSE ARE EMPLOYED IN AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND ALL OF THE RIGHTS THAT WE TYPICALLY ASSOCIATE WITH WORKING -- MINIMUM WAGE OVERTIME PROTECTIONS ANTI DISCRIMINATION ACCESS TO UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WORKER'S COMP. ALL THOSE THINGS THE RIGHT TO FOR IT TO TO BARGAIN WITH YOUR COLLEAGUES IN A UNION ALL THOSE PROTECTIONS APPLY IF YOU ARE AN EMPLOYEE BUT NOT IF YOU'RE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. SO THE DISTINCTION REALLY MATTERS MISMANAGED AGAIN MEANT THREE MINUTE WARNING TO SIR THANK YOU. THANKS -- I SHOULD HAVE A TIME MYSELF BUT NOW I KNOW BEING TIME -- SO HE THERE'S THERE'S CONSEQUENCES TO WORKERS IT COSTS MORE TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WORKERS HAVE TO PAY INTO THEIR OWN -- INTO A DO THEIR OWN SHARE OF PAYROLL TAXES WHICH IF YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE YOUR EMPLOYER TAKES CARE. IT'S EXPENSIVE TO OUR OUR GOVERNMENT OUR LOCAL FEDERAL AND STATE GOVERNMENT FOR A MISS CLASSIFICATION IS OF THERE. THERE ARE SOME REPORTS CITED UP THERE THAT TOP ONE IS PARTICULARLY STRIKING A YOU A TWO THOUSAND NINE REPORT BY THE U. S. GAO THE ESTIMATES THAT. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR MISS CLASSIFICATION COSTS FEDERAL REVENUES TWO POINT SEVEN TWO BILLION AND THIS WAS AN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX BUT IT'S A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER. ARE SO THERE ARE COSTS TO THE I'M NOT PAYING INTO SOCIAL SECURITY UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE WORKER'S COMP ALL THOSE THINGS -- AND THEN THERE ARE THE ET DE DOES AUDITS EVERY YEAR AND IN THE MOST RECENT AUDIT THE IDENTIFIED FOUR HUNDRED AND SIXTY ONE THOUSAND ON REPORTED EMPLOYEES. THE THE DIVISION OF LABOR STANDARDS ENFORCEMENT ESTIMATES THAT -- MISS CLASSIFICATION CASA STATE SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. I THINK YOU GET THE POINT IT'S VERY COSTLY TO THE GOVERNMENT AS WELL. AND THEN FINALLY IT'S EXPENSIVE FOR OTHER EMPLOYERS THAT PLAY BY THE RULES EMPLOYERS THAT CORRECTLY CLASSIFIED THEIR WORKERS AS EMPLOYEES PAY INTO ALL OF THE FUNDS THAT THEY ARE MADE TO PAY INTO WITH THEY THEY OFFER. THE THE MINIMUM WAGE AND ALL THE OTHER TYPES OF OF PAY THAT WORKERS ARE EMPLOYEES OR DO -- BUT EMPLOYERS THAT DON'T CLASSIFY A THEIR WORKERS AS EMPLOYEES DON'T AND SO THOSE THAT ARE FOLLOWING THE LAW ARE BASICALLY SUBSIDIZING. THE WORKERS THE EMPLOYERS WHO -- ARE ARE CALLING THAT WORKERS AND CONTRACTORS. SO ALL AROUND THE COUNTRY -- INCLUDING AT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT EVEN IN REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS ODD INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WITH CLASSIFICATION HAS BEEN. RECOGNIZED AS A PROBLEM -- FOR THOSE REASONS THAT I TALKED ABOUT -- THE LOSS OF RIGHTS TO WORKERS THE LOSS OF TAX REVENUES AND THE UNFAIR ADVANTAGE FOR US -- THAT THOSE -- THOSE COMPANIES HAVE COMPARED TO THE COMPANIES OF ALL OF THE LAW. I'M IN THE US DEAL WELL DEVOTES RESOURCES TO FIGHTING THIS CLASSIFICATION. AND A NUMBER OF STATES HAVE OF EACH HAVE -- CREATED TASK FORCES AND STUDIES AND TRYING TO GET AT THE PROBLEM TO UNDERSTAND THE THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM. AND OF COURSE THAT BRINGS US TO WHAT OUR STATE DID OUT LAST YEAR -- IN APRIL V. STOCK CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT UNANIMOUSLY DECIDED IN THE DYNAMICS DECISION. THAT THE ABC TEST APPLIES TO WAGE ORDERS AND IT'S CALLED THE A. B. C. TEST BECAUSE THERE ARE THREE PARTS TO IT PARTS A B. AND C.. AND IT'S SIMPLE AND IT'S STRAIGHT FORWARD AND IT'S EASY TO UNDERSTAND -- AND FROM MY ORGANIZATIONS PERSPECTIVE -- AND MY ORGANIZATION HAS BEEN WORKING ON IT FOR A LONG TIME IT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE NEED AT THE POLICY LEVEL TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM IS CLASSIFICATION -- HERE'S ABC PARTS WHICH I'M GONNA JUST SKIP OVER. BECAUSE YOU YOU KNOW YOU CAN READ IT IN THE DECISION -- AND I DID JUST WANT TO DRAW ATTENTION TO THE USE AN A. B. C. TEST IN ONE FORM OR ANOTHER CALIFORNIA JOINS THREE OTHER STATES THAT USE IT -- FOR WAIT AN HOUR PURPOSES BUT IT'S NOT THIS OUT OF THE BLUE TEST. UP IS THAT I TIME YES OKAY AND THERE WILL BE OPPORTUNITY OPERATE ALL THREE FREE THROWS FOR THE QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE THAT THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- NEXT UP WE HAVE -- RETIRED JUDGE JOHN TRUE THANK YOU JUDGE FOR BEING HERE. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND LET ME SET MY STOPWATCH SO THAT I NO CATEGORY. I NAME IS JOHN TRUE I AM RETIRED FROM THE ALAMEDA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. RACER FOR ELEVEN YEARS INCLUDING SIX IN A CIVIL TRIAL DEPARTMENT. I AM NOW ENGAGED TO THE PRIVATE PRACTICE OF MEDIATION AND ARBITRATION. I ALSO TEACH LAW AS AN ADJUNCT PROFESSOR. AT BAY AREA LAW SCHOOLS INCLUDING MY ALMA MATER UC BERKELEY LAW. STANFORD LAW SCHOOL AND HATE UC HASTINGS COLLEGE OF THE LAW. FOR I WAS APPOINTED TO THE BENCH IN TWO THOUSAND THREE I WAS A PRACTICING LAWYER. REPRESENTING WORKERS AND LABOR UNIONS OVER THE COURSE OF ALMOST TWENTY SEVEN YEARS. I'VE ALSO WRITTEN AND SPOKEN EXTENSIVELY ABOUT LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT LAW. ISSUES I HAVE A WRITTEN MY REMARKS WHICH I'LL. GIVE TO THE PANEL. AND MY CV IS ATTACHED TO IT. I WANT TO TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANCE I'VE DYNAMICS FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF A PRACTITIONER. A JUDGE AND A TEACHER. MY OWN INTRODUCTION TO THE COMPLEXITIES OF WORKERS. WORKER CLASSIFICATION INSTRUMENTED COME. HAS A STAFF ATTORNEY FOR A NONPROFIT EMPLOYMENT RIGHTS LAW ORGANIZATION WHICH SPONSORED A LEGAL CLINIC. I FOUND MYSELF REPRESENTING GUARDS CHEN NOW SKI. A MIDDLE AGED DRIVER FOR A SAN FRANCISCO TAXI COMPANY. GUARDS HAD BEEN LET GO BY HIS COMPANY AND HAD APPLIED FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS. HE CAME TO OUR CLINIC WHAT IS APPLICATION WAS DENIED. BY THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT ON THE GROUNDS THAT HE WAS NOT AN EMPLOYEE OF HIS COMPANY. BUT A LESSEE OF ONE OF THEIR CABS OWNERSHIP BY CHEF. BASIS HE WAS THERE FOR GAME TO BE AN INDEPENDENT. CONTRACTOR. WHEN I ASKED HER GUARDS LIVES SO THAT I? FURTHER HE GAVE ME DIRECTIONS TO A STREET OUT IN THE AVENUES. THERE ARE A FEW DAYS LATER I FOUND A BEAT UP CHEVROLET CAPRICE STATION WAGON WHICH HAD LONG AGO SEEN ITS BETTER DAYS. THIS WAS CARS HOME. AND HAD OBVIOUSLY BEEN. THAT FOR SOME TIME. I YOUNG HASTINGS STUDENT WORKING AT OUR CLINIC WAS ABLE UNDER MY SUPERVISION. TO CONVINCING EDT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE TO GRANT YOU WE BENEFITS TO MISTER CHEN OWSKI. SUCCESSFULLY ARGUING THAT THE CAB COMPANY HAD THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THE MATERIAL DETAILS OF HOW GARTH PERFORM HIS JOB. GARTH WAS NOT THE ONLY SAN FRANCISCO TAXI. DRIVER TO COME INTO THE CLINIC. I REMEMBER TALKING TO OTHERS INCLUDING VIVIDLY ENOUGH THE YOUNG WIDOW OF ANOTHER DRIVER WHO HAD BEEN ASSAULTED IN HIS CAB. HE DIED IN SAN FRANCISCO GENERAL HOSPITAL. A CHARITY CASE. HAVING BEEN DENIED WORKERS COMPENSATION BENEFITS FOR THE SAME REASON THAT GARTH COULDN'T GET UNEMPLOYMENT. HE WAS A SO CALLED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. WHEN WE AT THE CLINIC BEGAN TO LOOK INTO THIS WE FOUND SO MUCH TO OUR SURPRISE? THAT THE COURTS HAD ALREADY RESOLVE THIS ISSUE. WE FOUND TO PUBLISH TAXI CAB DECISIONS ONE INVOLVING YOU WE BENEFITS AND THE OTHER WORKERS COMPENSATION. BOTH HELD THAT CAB DRIVERS ARE EMPLOYEES. BOTH ARE STILL IN THE BOOKS THAT ARE PUT NOTED. IN MY PAPER SO WHY WAS IT THAT ALL TAXI CAB DRIVERS WORDS EMPLOYEES WENT TO COURTS OF APPEAL HAD FOUND THAT THEY WORK. AFTER SOME MORE RESEARCH AND SOME ORGANIZING AMONG CAB DRIVERS WE BROUGHT A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT AGAINST FIVE OF THE MAJOR CAB COMPANIES IN THE CITY. TO TRY TO GET AN ANSWER. BY THE TIME OUR CASE WAS FILED THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAD DECIDED BAROLO AND SONS VERSUS DIR. FINDING SHARECROPPING FARM WORKERS TO BE EMPLOYEES WE ACTUALLY CITED THAT CASE IN OUR COMPLAINT. ALONG WITH IT TO PUBLISHED. TAXI CAB DECISIONS SURELY WE LOG ON OUR SIDE. CARRILLO ANNOUNCED THAT THE PRIMARY FACTOR IN MAKING A DETERMINATION OF EMPLOYEES STATUS WAS WHETHER THE EMPLOYER. HAD THE RIGHT TO EXERCISE ALL NECESSARY CONTROL TO USE THE COURTS PHRASE OVER THE OVERALL OPERATIONS OF THE BUSINESS IN WHICH THE WORKER WAS ENGAGED. TO BE SURE THE CASE SAT OUT A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED CHECKLIST OF OTHER FACTORS TO LOOK AT BUT IT MADE IT QUITE CLEAR. THAT. QUOTE THE TEST FOR DETERMINING WHETHER A PERSON RENDERING SERVICE TO ANOTHER IS AN EMPLOYEE OR AN EXCLUDED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. MUST BE APPLIED WITH DEFERENCE TO THE PURPOSES OF THE PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION. ON QUOTE. THIS IDEA OF DEFERRING TO THE STATUTORY PURPOSE WAS AN IMPORTANT SIGNAL WE THOUGHT. OUR LAWSUIT HAD TWO MAIN GOALS FIRST WE WANTED A JUDICIAL DECLARATION THAT THOSE WE REPRESENTED ALONG WITH OTHERS IN SITUATIONS JUST LIKE FAIRS WERE EMPLOYEES. ENTITLED TO THE SAFETY NET. THE LAW PROVIDES WE DID NOT SUIT FOR MINIMUM WAGES OVERTIME PAY OR ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE ENTITLEMENT TO YOU WE BENEFITS WERE APPLICABLE AND TO WORKERS COMP BENEFITS. FOR INJURED DRIVERS ESTABLISHING THESE RIGHTS WE FELT WOULD CLARIFY. THAT THE PUBLIC FACE COULD NOT BE BURDENED AS IT APPARENTLY WAS BEING. WITH A NEED TO SUPPORT UNEMPLOYED OR INJURED WORKERS EMPLOYERS WOULD KNOW THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES. AND WORKERS WOULD NO THERE RIGHT RECEIVED A PUBLIC BENEFIT IN TAKING THE FIRST STEP TO RAISE THE FLOOR. UNDER VULNERABLE MARGINALLY EMPLOYED. MEMBERS OF A PRECARIOUS CLASS OF WORKERS. WITH A BROAD FINDING OF EMPLOYEES STATUS A WHOLE SET OF WORKERS OF COLOR. FEMALE WORKERS IMMIGRANTS AND OTHERS COULD BEGIN TO A CERTAIN RIGHTS. THAT ARE GUARANTEED TO EMPLOYEES BUT DENIED TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WORKPLACES INCLUDING TAXICABS COULD BE MADE SAFER. UNDER OSHA AND OTHER LAWS WAGE THAT COULD BE MORE EASILY ABATED. THE TAXI LAWSUIT WENT ON FOR YEARS AND I'M NOT GOING TO GET INTO IT. BUT CARRILLO AS WE KNOW AS WE KNOW SPAWNED A GREAT DEAL OF LITIGATION IN CALIFORNIA. AND ELSEWHERE AND THAT LITIGATION WAS EXPENSIVE. FRUSTRATING AND AT LEAST IN THE CASES IN WHICH I WAS INVOLVED STRESSFUL. FOR BOTH SIDES. ALTHOUGH THE CASE MADE IT CLEAR THAT WORKER PROTECTIVE LEGISLATION WAS TO BE INTERPRETED. BROADLY THERE REMAIN PROBLEMS. ONE IMPORTANT ONE WAS THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL TEST UNDER BURRELL AS APPLIED TO CLASS ACTION LITIGATION. OUR CLIENTS BORE THE BURDEN OF PROVING THAT THEY SHARED A COMMUNITY OF INTEREST WITH OTHER UNNAMED CLASS MEMBERS AND THEY COMMON LEGAL AND FACTUAL ISSUES PREDOMINATED. MORELLO'S MULTI FACTOR ANALYSIS. USUALLY COMPLICATED THIS PROCESS ONE SENTENCE FROM THE CASE THAT I REMEMBER. BEING USED OVER AND OVER AGAIN IN THE CLASS ACTIONS THAT I HANDLED WAS. EACH SERVICE ARRANGEMENT MUST BE EVALUATED ON ITS FACTS. AND THE DISPOSITIVE CIRCUIT MAY VARY FROM CASE TO CASE THIS NOTION ALONE. LED TO LENGTHY DEPOSITIONS CONVOLUTED WRITTEN DISCOVERY AND JUDICIAL CONFUSION. BY THE TIME I BECAME A JUDGE. IT WAS CLEAR THAT A MULTI FACTOR APPROACH WAS LEADING TO A WIDE VARIETY RESULTS. ENDING ON WHICH FACTORS WERE EMPHASIZED BY THEIR RESPECTIVE COURTS. CARRILLO AND OTHER CASES LIKE THE TAXI DECISIONS WE FOUND WERE EXAMPLES OF A LIBERAL APPLICATION OF THE TEST. BUT OTHER CASES WENT THE OTHER WAY. THE SAME SEEM TO BE THE CASE WHEN IT WILL CAME TO DETERMINING WHETHER TO GRANT OR DENY MOTIONS FOR CLASS CERT. WHILE AYALA VERSUS ANTELOPE VALLEY NEWSPAPERS UP HELD CLASSROOMS CERTIFICATION OR NEWSPAPER CARRIERS PRIMARILY BECAUSE THE RIGHT OF CONTROL EVIDENCE -- BY THE PROVISIONS IN A COMIC CONTRACT OTHER CASES HELD OTHERWISE SOMETIMES IN THE SAME INDUSTRY. WHEN AND WHAT CAME? OUT OF ALL OF THIS FINALLY WAS DYNAMICS AND THE A. B. C. CAT TESS REFERRED TO BY MY COLLEAGUE. OF FROM NOW. THE QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE IS. DOES HE AB TEST ABC TESS MAKE THINGS BETTER. THE COMMITTEE WILL HEAR PROS AND CONS FROM INTERESTED PARTIES THIS MORNING. MY EXPERIENCE AS AN ADVOCATE FOR LOW WAGE WORKERS. SUGGEST THAT IT WILL BE IT WILL MORE ADEQUATELY SERVE THE LEGISLATURE'S INTEREST IN LIFTING THESE WORKERS UP. MY EXPERIENCE AS A JUDGE AND A TEACHER IS IT WILL BRING WELCOME CLARITY. PREDICTABILITY AND ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THIS IMPORTANT AREA OF THE LAW. THANK YOU. AND AS I SAID I HAVE COPIES OF MY STATEMENT FOR THE COMMITTEE OUR TELL PROVIDE AFTER. THANK YOU JUDGE YOU TOOK NINE MINUTES AND FIFTY SECONDS YOU KNOW THAT. THAT THE JUDGE FOR YOU RIGHT HERE RIGHT ON TIME AND SO. WAIT I HAVE ONE MORE QUESTION YEAH -- AND AND BOTH THE THE GET THE COPIES. THE MOBILE WEB BUT ANYWAY -- IN ANY CASE. BOTH THE THE POWER POINTS THAT WE SEE SOME OF THE STUDIES REFERENCE THE COMMENTS HERE -- BY THE JUDGE AS WELL AS SUBSEQUENT SPEAKERS ON THE PLAYER PANEL EMPLOYEE PANEL -- IT WILL MAKE SURE THAT ALL THAT IS AVAILABLE TO FOLKS SO THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU DON'T HAVE TO SCRIBBLE DOWN REFERENCE THIS WAS LATER WILL MAKE SURE THAT ALL THE POWER POINTS AND EVERYTHING REFER TO BRING ALL THE PRESENTATIONS WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE. UP THROUGH OUR OFFICE IN AN ONLINE. AND THEN THE NEXT UP A PROFESSOR DOUBLE. SO I MOVED BECAUSE I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FOLKS IN THIS ROOM PARTICULARLY -- THE SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE AND THE WORKERS HERE WHAT I HAVE TO SAY THAT IN A MINUTE DISPEL SOME MYTHS THAT YOU MAY HAVE BEEN TOLD -- THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TO SHARE MY RESEARCH AND EXPERTISE WITH THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE TODAY. MY NAME IS V. B. TWO BALL I AM ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF LAW AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AT HASTINGS COLLEGE OF LAW WHERE I TEACH EMPLOYMENT LAW -- TO JOINING THE FACULTY AT UC HASTINGS IS A MIKE OKAY OKAY -- PRIOR TO JOINING THE FACULTY AT UC HASTINGS I WAS A POSTDOCTORAL FELLOW AT STANFORD UNIVERSITY ALSO MY UNDERGRADUATE ALMA MATTER I RECEIVED BOTH MY JD AND MY PHD FROM UC BERKELEY SCHOOL OF LAW. FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS I'VE BEEN STUDYING WHAT WE NOW REFER TO AS THE GIG ECONOMY. FROM A LEGAL POLICY AN ANTHROPOLOGICAL LANDS. MY RESEARCH HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN TOP TIER LAW REVIEWS IN PEER REVIEW JOURNALS AND IT HAS BEEN PRESENTED TO POLICYMAKERS AND ACADEMICS AND BOTH THE US AND IN EUROPE. ONE OF MY ARTICLES WAS IN FACT RECENTLY CITED BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT IN THE DYNAMICS DECISION. THERE ARE NUMBER OF MISCONCEPTIONS AND PIECES OF INFORMATION ABOUT THE CALIFORNIA GET ECONOMY THAT I HAVE ON COVERED IN MY MANY YEARS OF ENGAGED LEGAL. AND ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH AND LAW PRACTICE. THE FIRST IS THAT THE GET ECONOMIES NEW KNOWLEDGE AND INNOVATION. IN FACT BUSINESS MODELS INTENDED TO LOWER LABOR COSTS BY UTILIZING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR LABOR. FIRST PROLIFIC PROLIFERATED IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. THE SECOND MISCONCEPTION IS THAT WORKERS MUST BE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN ORDER CHAPS LIKES ABILITY AND BE INDEPENDENT. BASED ON AN ACCURATE LEGAL READING OF THIS DYNAMICS CASE THIS IS FALSE. THE THIRD AND LAST SMITH I WILL DISPEL IS THAT THE DYNAMICS DECISION WILL DESTROY OR TO TYR INNOVATION AND BUSINESS. IT WILL NOT. FIRST WHY FROM HISTORICAL IN LEGAL LANDS IS THE GIG ECONOMY NOT NEW OR TIED TO TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION. THE ANSWER TO THIS LIES IN THE HISTORY OF HOW WE GOT TWO CATEGORIES OF WORKERS. INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND EMPLOYEES FOR THE PURPOSES OF SOCIAL PROTECTIONS. AS I SHOW IN MY RESEARCH AND A SUPREME COURT JUSTICE NEIL GORSUCH POINTED OUT IN HIS RECENT UNANIMOUS NEW PRIME BE ALL OF THE ARE A DECISION. IN THE NINETEEN TWENTIES AND NINETEEN THIRTIES DURING THE GREAT DEPRESSION THOSE WHO LABORED WHETHER THEY WERE TAXI DRIVERS INSURANCE SALESMAN ARTISTS OR FACTORY WORKERS WERE COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS WORKERS OR AS EMPLOYEES. INDEED WHEN THE NEW DEAL WAS PASSED THE TERM INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR DID NOT HAVE A DISTINCT MEANING OUTSIDE AGENCY LAW. IS CHEWING THE INCREASED LABOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW DEAL CLEVER BUSINESS REPRESENTATIVES IN THE MID TWENTIETH CENTURY TURNED TO THE EIGHTIETH CONGRESS FOR A LEGISLATIVE REPRIEVE. MUCH LIKE THEY'RE DOING TO YOU TODAY. EIGHTIETH CONGRESS ALSO KNOWN AS THE DO NOTHING CONGRESS FOR ITS OPPOSITION TO TRUMAN'S NEW DEAL. I WENT ON TO KERR ABOUT SO CALLED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FROM THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT THE SOCIAL SECURITY ACT AND THE NATIONAL LABOR RELATIONS ACT IMPORTANTLY CONGRESS MADE THESE CAR ABOUT DESPITE AN OVER A PRESIDENTIAL VETO. IN JUNE OF NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT PRESIDENT TRUMAN EXPLAINS WHY HE WAS OPPOSED TO ALLOWING BUSINESSES TO ESCAPE LIABILITY TO IN FOR SOME WORKERS. HE SAID THIS RESOLUTION WOULD EXCLUDE FROM THE COVERAGE SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND EMPLOYEES CONSISTING OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE PERSONS WORKING AS COMMISSION SALESMEN. LIFE INSURANCE SALESMEN PIECE WORKERS TRUCK DRIVERS TAXI CAB DRIVERS MINERS JOURNEYMEN TAILORS AND OTHERS. I CAN NOT APPROVED LEGISLATION WHICH WOULD DEPRIVE MANY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AS WELL AS THEIR FAMILIES OF BENEFITS WHEN THE NEED FOR EXPANDING OUR SOCIAL INSURANCE SYSTEM IS SO GREAT. BY THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUSINESS MODEL SPREAD INTO COLD IN A WIDE VARIETY OF INDUSTRIES INCLUDING JANITORIAL SERVICES NAIL SALONS TAXI BUSINESSES AND EVEN SOFTWARE COMPANIES. IN CALIFORNIA FOR MANY DECADES THESE WORKERS HAVE FOUGHT MISS CLASSIFICATION. UNDER WHAT IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO HELLO STANDARD A DERIVATION OF THE COMMON LAW OF AGENCY TEST. A LITTLE UNDERSTOOD REALITY IS THAT CALIFORNIA WORKERS WHO LABOR IN GRAVESTONES CAN BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR SOME LAWS AND EMPLOYEES FOR OTHERS. THERE IS SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PASSED FOR ALMOST EVERY FEDERAL LAW. AND IN CALIFORNIA THE PREVAILING TEST FOR STATE LAW HAD BEEN THE BAROLO TEST. UNDER BAROLO WORKERS WERE EMPLOYEES FOR PURPOSES OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE IF A FACT FINDER DECIDED USING THIS UNWIELDY ELEVEN FACTOR TEST THAT CONSIDERING THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE WORKER WAS AN EMPLOYEE. THE SUBJECTIVE NATURE OF THIS TECHNICALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES TEST HAS LED TO AN INCONSISTENT INCONSISTENT OUTCOMES. ON THE SAME SET OF FACTS BEFUDDLING BOTH BUSINESSES AND WORKERS. NOTE THAT THE MOST CONTESTED PART OF THE DYNAMICS A. B. C. TEST PART BE HIGHLIGHTED HERE. THE ONE THAT IS BEING REPORTED AS BEING THE MOST RADICAL SHIFT IS ACTUALLY ALREADY A FACTOR IN THE BURRELL ATTACHED. DYNAMICS PUTS THE BURDEN ON THE EMPLOYER TO PROVE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS IN SIMPLIFIES THE BRILLO TEST FACILITATING CLEAR CONSISTENT LEGAL DECISIONS ABOUT EMPLOYEES STATUS. BUT NOTICE NOTABLY AND THIS IS IMPORTANT DYNAMICS DOES NOT SIMPLIFY THE TEST FOR ALL CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWS. RATHER THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT WAS VERY CLEAR THAT THE ABC TEST ONLY APPLIES TO CALIFORNIA WAGE ORDERS. IN DOING SO THE COURT COURT WAS RESPONDING TO THIS DYSTOPIAN REALITY THAT DOES LABORING AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN OUR STATE ARE SOMETIMES MAKING LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE. PUTTING A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA FAMILIES WHO STRUGGLE TO PAY THEIR RENT AND WHO PUT TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE. AND THIS BRINGS ME TO MY NEXT POINT. GIVEN THE DYNAMICS DOES NOT APPLY TO CALIFORNIA LAWS OUTSIDE OF WAGE ORDERS. THE THE TEST IN ITS APPLICATION DO NOT RESTRICT WORKER FLEXIBILITY. WHAT THE TEST DOES DO IS AND OUR A WORKER LABORS? SHE GETS THE MINIMUM WAGE AND IF SHE LABOURS FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS IN THAT DAY THEN SHE GETS OVER TIME THAT'S IT. DYNAMICS DOES NOT CHANGE THE TEST FOR EMPLOYEES STATUS FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND FOR OTHER CALIFORNIA EMPLOYEE PROTECTIONS. MAYBE IT SHOULD BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT CONVERSATION. IN GARCIA BE BORDER TRANSPORTATION THE CALIFORNIA APPELLATE COURT AFFIRMED JUST THREE MONTHS AGO THAT DYNAMICS ONLY APPLIES TO WAIT ORDERS AND DOES NOT EVEN EXTEND TO VEHICLE REIMBURSEMENT WALKS. A LOT OF MISINFORMATION HAS PROLIFERATED ACROSS CALIFORNIA INDUSTRY SINCE DYNAMICS WAS DECIDED. AND THIS MISINFORMATION HAS RESULTED IN WHAT I BELIEVE IS A STATE OF HYSTERIA. SMALL BUSINESSES ARE AFRAID THAT THEY WILL BE UP ENDED. AND WORKERS ARE AFRAID THAT THEY WILL LOSE THE FLEXIBILITY THEY NEED. I HAVE TALKED TO PEOPLE FROM FREELANCE JOURNALISTS TO MOONLIGHTING PSYCHIATRISTS TO TRUCK DRIVERS WHO SAY THAT THEY'RE BEING TOLD THAT THE DYNAMICS DECISION MEANS THEY CANNOT DO FREELANCE WORK ANYMORE. AND THAT IS JUST NOT TRUE. CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL WORKERS ARE ALREADY EXEMPT FROM CALIFORNIA WAGE ORDERS. THIS CLASS OF PROFESSIONAL WORKERS INCLUDES MOST DOCTORS ENGINEERS ACCOUNTANTS ARCHITECTS MANY JOURNALISTS AND EVEN ARTISTIC PROFESSIONALS WHO PERFORM WORK THAT IS CREATIVE OR ORIGINAL. THE PROFESSIONAL HAS TO MEET A SALARY TEST AND A DUTY STASHED AND IF SHE DOES THE DYNAMICS AND MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PRODUK PROTECTIONS DO NOT APPLY TO HER. EVEN FOR THOSE WHOM DYNAMICS CLEARLY APPLIES NAIL SALON WORKERS MANY CONSTRUCTION WORKERS UBER DRIVERS DOOR DASH INSTEAD CART WORKERS. THE DECISION DOESN'T MEAN THAT WORKERS HAVE TO WORK SHIFTS AND LOSE THEIR FLEXIBILITY AND FREEDOM. THESE ARE THREATS MADE BY COMPANIES WHO DO NOT WANT TO PAY THE VERY BASIC MINIMUM WAGE. GIVEN HOW EASY IT IS TO TRACK THROUGH AN APP ON A SMARTPHONE. IMPLEMENTING DYNAMICS WILL REQUIRE NOTHING MORE OF COMPANIES THAN PAYING WORKERS MORE OF SHARING MORE OF THE PROFIT PIE WITH THE VERY PEOPLE WHOSE LABOR PRODUCES WEALTH. IF YOU DON'T BELIEVE THE LAW PROFESSOR. LET ME DRAW ATTENTION TO THE ANALYSIS OF A PARTNER AT LIVE LITTLER MENDELSON. THE PREMIER EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER DEFENSE FIRM WHO REPRESENTS MANY MEDIUM TO LARGE BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING UBER WALMART APPLE IT'S SUCHA. HERE'S A PARTNERS WHO SPECIALIZES IN THIS CLASSIFICATION WRITING THAT BECAUSE DYNAMICS ONLY APPLIES TO WAIT ORDERS IT APPLIES ONLY TO WORKERS WHO ARE NON EXEMPT EMPLOYEES. THUS EVEN IF WORKERS ARE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE TEST SO IF YOU DO THE ANALYSIS YOURSELF AND IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE UNDER THE TEST YOU STILL MIGHT NOT GET THE PROTECTION OF THE TEST. IF YOU ARE AN EXEMPT EMPLOYEE. IT APPLIES ONLY TO WORKERS WHO ARE NOT EXACT. HE ALSO SAYS BECAUSE THE WEIGHT ORDERS IMPACT ONLY A LIMITED NUMBER OF ISSUES IT MAY BE OF LITTLE CONSEQUENCE IF A WORKER IS AN EMPLOYEE FOR WHICH PURPOSES SO IF YOU'RE ALREADY MAKING THE MINIMUM WAGE. YOUR GREAT. SO WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT THIS TEST THAT. NOT WORKERS WHO ARE ALREADY MAKING THE MINIMUM WAGE NOT PROFESSIONAL WORKERS WHO ARE EXEMPT FROM WAGE ORDERS AND CERTAINLY NOT THE WORKERS WHO NEED OR WANT FREEDOM AND FLEXIBILITY ON THEIR JOB. THE ONLY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD BE WORRIED ABOUT DYNAMICS ARE COMPANIES THAT AS A MATTER OF BUSINESS PRACTICE UNDER PAY THEIR WORKERS. THESE ARE THE COMPANIES LIKE DOOR DASH AN INSTA CART WHICH ARE ALLEGED TO HAVE TAKEN TIPS FROM CUSTOMERS TO COMPENSATE THE BASE PAY FOR THE DELIVERY DRIVERS. IN LIKE UBER WHICH NUMEROUS STUDIES HAVE REVEALED PAY THEIR WORKERS LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE OF MOST MAJOR CITIES. THESE COMPANIES SAY THAT DYNAMICS IS RETROGRADE THAT IT DISCOURAGES INNOVATION. BUT LET ME BE CLEAR THERE IS NOTHING INNOVATIVE OR KNEW ABOUT UNDER PAYING AN OVER WORKING LABORERS. THE IDEA THAT WHAT WORKERS REALLY NEED IS NOT MINIMUM WAGE PROTECTIONS BUT SOMETHING ELSE ENTIRELY SAY PORTABLE BENEFITS IS FALSE WHATEVER YOU CALL THEM EMPLOYEES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WORKERS LABOR SMALL BUSINESSMEN EVERYONE. EVERY WORKING CALIFORNIAN DESERT THAT CAN SUPPORT THEIR FAMILY. AND LET ME ADD ON THE TOPIC OF PORTABLE BENEFITS THAT THE ACA UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SOCIAL SECURITY A MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME PROTECTIONS ARE ALL PORTABLE BENEFITS WORKERS CAN TAKE THESE FROM JOB TO JOB. IF THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO ADD TO THIS LIST OF WORKER PROTECTION FOR THEM THAT'S GREAT THESE WORKERS NEED PAID VACATION THEY NEED PAID SICK LEAVE BUT PLEASE DO NOT TAKE THE HARD FOUGHT FOR RIGHT. TO A MINIMUM WAGE AWAY FROM THEM THINK. I HAVE JUST ONE LAST WEEK AND ONE LAST THING PUESTO EIGHTY YEARS AGO WHEN HE FOUGHT FOR THE FIRST FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT FAMOUSLY ARGUED THAT NO BUSINESS WHICH DEPENDS FOR ITS EXISTENCE ON PAYING LESS THAN LIVING WAGES TO ITS WORKERS. HAS ANY RIGHT TO CONTINUE IN THIS COUNTRY. TIME AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE NOT CHANGED THIS BASIC PRINCIPLE. THESE INNOVATIVE WELL FUNDED COMPANIES CAN PAY WORKERS WHAT THEY DESERVE BY LAW. IT MIGHT MEAN SPENDING LESS MONEY SETTLING THIS CLASSIFICATION CASES LESS MONEY DOLED OUT TO EXECUTIVES LESS MONEY PAID TO LOBBYISTS BUT THE WORKERS WHO DRIVE THE CARS AND TRUCKS TO CLEAN THE HOMES. WHO BUILD THE BUILDINGS TO DO OUR SERVICE WORK ARE THE ONES WHOSE LABOR PRODUCES WEALTH FOR THIS STATE AND THEY DESERVE AT LEAST THE MINIMUM WAGE? THANK THANK YOU PROFESSOR -- AND WILL OPEN IT UP -- FOR MEMBER BECAUSE I HAVE A COUPLE AND THEN ALL WILL ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS AT ALL. COPIES OF MY YEAH WE'LL WE'LL WE'LL GET THAT. THANK YOU AGAIN ANNE THE OUR PLANS WHEN HAVE YOU WILL MAKE SURE THAT THE IT'S AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC -- SO OF A MISS MADE THE AND IT SOMETHING ONE YEAR CHART SHOW THAT OF A AND THEN YOU INTO LEE IS A GOOD THING THAT THE JUDGE EVEN MADE REFERENCE TO THE FACT THAT. IT'S CLEAR THAT THE CLARITY CAN BE HELPFUL. AND BUT AS A NATIONAL THINK TANK WHAT IS -- ANY -- P. LEARNED ABOUT THE APPLICATION OF THE TEST IN OTHER STATES AS OR AT LEAST TO EMPLOYER CONCERNS. BUT IT'S SWIM FLEXIBLE AND PUT COMPANIES OUT OF BUSINESS OR OR OR INTERRUPT THEIR KIND OF BUSINESS MODEL. SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY THAT THE A. B. C. TEST IS USED IN OVER HALF THE STATES BUT IN SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT CONTEXT DEPENDING ON THE STATE SO. JUST TO BE CLEAR SO -- THE MAJORITY OF STATES USE IT FOR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PURPOSES FOUR STATES INCLUDING CALIFORNIA BUT MAYBE MORE THIS YEAR -- BECAUSE SOME OTHER STATE LEGISLATURES ARE CONSIDERING THE A. B. C. TEST FOR WAGING OUR PURPOSES -- I GUESS I'LL ANSWER YOUR QUESTION WITH SAYING THAT WE DON'T TYPICALLY -- LOOK AT LIKE OUR OUR FOCUS IS ON THE EFFECTS ON WORKERS AND ON THEIR ACCESS TO RIGHTS AND BENEFITS AND AND BASIC STANDARD SO -- I'M NOT SURE I'M THE RIGHT PERSON TO ASK ABOUT I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S OUR ROLE. TO IDENTIFY THAT BUT IT JUST IF YOU'VE I GUESS WE CAN ASK HIM WILL BE EMPLOYERS APPEAR VERY SOON AS WE CAN ASSN THAT AND THEN I AM. A PROFESSOR TO BALK. GIVEN THE EMPHASIS YOU VALIUM AND SOME YOUR CLOSING COMMENTS REGARDING THE GIG ECONOMY DO YOU. DO YOU HAVE ANY INSIGHT AS TO KIND OF THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF THOSE THAT RELY ON THAT FOR THEIR SUSTENANCE. THAT KIND OF WORK YES SO I HAVE -- IN PARTICULAR IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE REFERENCING SORT OF THE TECHNOLOGICALLY ENABLE GET A CONNIE I SPENT YOU KNOW OVER FOUR YEARS -- WORKING ALONG SIDE AND WITH TAXI WORKERS AND SAN FRANCISCO BEFORE THE ADVENT OF UBER AND LEFT AND THEN I SPENT TWO YEARS DOING RESEARCH -- WITH UBER DRIVERS -- WHO WORKED IN SAN FRANCISCO -- THESE FOLKS BECAUSE THEY LACK ANY KIND OF REGULATION BASICALLY -- WITH THE UNLIKE TAXI DRIVERS WHO HAD WHO HAD -- VEHICLE CAPS AND FAIR REGULATION THROUGH THEIR CITIES. MANY OF THEM ARE ESSENTIALLY MIGRANT WORKERS THEY COME UP FROM ORANGE COUNTY AT THE LA AREA TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA -- THEY SLEEP IN THEIR CARS THEY DRIVE SIXTEEN HOURS A DAY -- MANY ARE MAKING LESS THAN THE MINIMUM WAGE THEIR WAGES ARE COMPLETELY UNPREDICTABLE -- AND I TAKE SERIOUSLY THE FACT THAT THEY NEED FLEXIBLE AN INDEPENDENT -- LIVELIHOODS BECAUSE MANY OF THEM ARE LIVING TRANCE NATIONAL LIVES -- THEY ARE A FAMILY -- THEY HAVE FAMILIES THEY ARE ARE USING THIS WORK TO SUPPLEMENT A SECOND JOB -- AND THESE FOLKS OVERWHELMINGLY TELL ME. INTERESTINGLY IN THIS IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SURVEYS AND ETHNOGRAPHY AND MY SURVEY -- RESEARCH I FOUND THAT MANY DRIVERS SAID NO NO WE WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ABOUT BUT THEN WHEN I DID LONG INTERVIEWS WITH THESE DRIVERS THE REASON THAT THEY WANTED TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IS BECAUSE THEY SAID THESE COMPANIES ARE SO HORRIBLE. THAT THEY'RE WORRIED THEIR LIVES WOULD BE EVEN MORE HORRIBLE AS AN EMPLOYEE -- AND OVERWHELMINGLY EVERYONE EVEN PEOPLE WHO SAID THAT THEY THAT THEY NEEDED -- THEY NEEDED THEY WANTED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BECAUSE THEY ASSOCIATED THAT -- STATUS WITH FLEXIBILITY AND SO PART OF WHAT I REALLY WHAT I WRITE ABOUT AND WHAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND IS THAT -- BEING AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR -- BEING AN EMPLOYEE FOR WAGE PURPOSES DOES NOT MEAN THAT YOU HAVE TO LOSE FLEXIBILITY -- INDEPENDENCE IT REALLY JUST MEANS THAT YOU'VE GOT THE WAGE FLOOR. AND AN LITTLE. THANK YOU AND AND AND JUDGE SHOULD THE THE INITIAL QUESTION I HAD FOR MISS MADE THAT JUST REGARDING. THE GIVEN THE FACT YOU BEEN KIND OF IN THE SPACE FOR A VERY LONG TIME -- DO YOU HAVE A SENSE OF WHAT EMPLOYERS ISSUES OF IN THEIR SIMPLICITY BUT WHAT EMPLOYERS ISSUES MIGHT BE. WITH THE A BC ROLE IN TERMS ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBILITY I DO. FROM MY EXPERIENCE -- MEDIATING CASES AND ALSO WHILE I WAS ON THE BENCH AND I HAVE TO SAY THAT. THERE ARE SITUATIONS PARTICULARLY INVOLVING SMALL BUSINESSES. WHEN EVERYONE INVOLVED -- SEEMS TO WANT -- A FLEXIBLE. ARMS LENGTH BUSINESS RELATIONSHIP CHARACTERIZED. BY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS THE THEY SHARECROPPERS IN CARRILLO. OUR FAMILIES WHO MADE THEIR LIVING -- HARVESTING CUCUMBERS -- THEY WANTED THAT. THEY WANTED THAT. HOW THE PROBLEM WAS THAT THEY HAD THEIR KIDS WORKING IN THE FIELDS WITH THEM? AND THAT'S WHAT THE AD DEPARTMENT IN MODESTO INDUSTRIAL RELATIONS NOTICED AND THAT'S WHY THE CASE CAME ABOUT. BUT I'VE SEEN ON THE BENCH OUR CAR WASH -- WORKERS OF YOU KNOW WHO MAKE A LIVING GETTING. A BIG TIPS FROM CARS THEY DETAIL AS WHO WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THEIR EMPLOYER -- DESCRIBES ITSELF AS IT POSSIBLE FOR THESE ENTREPRENEURS. TO DO WHAT THEY DO. SO EITHER THERE IS. THE IT IS NOT A BLACK AND WHITE SITUATION THERE ARE SITUATIONS IN WHICH LEGITIMATE. LAWYERS NOT THE KIND OF PROFESSOR DUVALL DESCRIBES BUT WHERE'S WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE A LIVING AND TRYING TO BE FAIR. TO THOSE WHO WORK WITH THEM -- COULD BE VEXED BY -- THE APPLICATION OF THE A. B. C. TEST ACROSS THE BOARD AS PROFESSOR DO BALL POINTS UT HOWEVER. OF HIS OF LAW ALREADY -- MAKES ALLOWANCES FOR THAT SORT OF A SITUATION AND AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. THANK YOU JUDGE A SUMMER GONZALEZ. HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS FOR SO I WANT TO THANK YOU ALL WAS VERY INFORMATIVE. EVEN FOR SOMEBODY WHO THINKS THEY DEAL WITH THIS EVERY DAY I LEARNED A NUMBER OF THINGS TODAY -- I TO QUESTION I THINK IT WAS THE FIRST PRESENTATION DO WE KNOW -- I THINK THERE WAS SOMETHING ABOUT CLOSE TO HALF A MILLION WORKERS AND SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS OF LOSSES KIND OF THAT ARE. NOT REPORTED IS THAT THE NUMBER WHAT WE BELIEVE TEN NINETY NINE WORKERS WHO AREN'T PAIN IN -- TO APPROPRIATE TAX STRUCTURE. THAT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS NUMBER -- THAT I REFERENCE WAS FROM THAT THE LSC WEBSITE AND AS I UNDERSTAND IT THEY SUBMITTED A BRIEF -- IN THE IN THE DYNAMICS CASE BUT I WASN'T ABLE TO FIND A COPY OF IT SO. I CAN SEE I CAN. POKE AROUND BECAUSE IT IS AN ANTI BEFORE TODAY -- AND SEE IF I CAN FIND SO WE BUT WE HAVE A BELIEF THAT A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE TEN NINETY NINE IS IN A PANIC CONTRACTORS DON'T TO FILL THEIR QUARTERLY REPORTING TAX LIABILITIES PAY THEIR APPROPRIATE NOT MOUNT OF TAXES IS THAT CORRECT. ALL RIGHT ENDS AND THAT IS A RIGHT THAT THE LSE ON THE E. R. ET DE IN NUMBERS -- ARE ALSO PROBABLY RELEVANT FOR THE PURPOSES OF PEOPLE PAYING OR NOT PAYING AYE INTO THEIR TAXES. BECAUSE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I HAVE -- KIND OF PERPLEXED ME IN THESE DISCUSSIONS WHEN PEOPLE D EMAILING ME OR MESSAGING ME ON TWITTER IS THIS I MEAN OUTRIGHT. STATEMENT I DON'T WANT TO PAY TAXES IN FACT LIKE I I LOSE ALL THIS MONEY BECAUSE SUDDENLY I'M GONNA HAVE TO PAY TAXES. BUT IF A WORKER IS IN FACT DOING THAT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE VIOLATING THE LAW CRACKED YEAH OKAY SO I I KNOW ESPECIALLY WITH THE KIND OF UNDERGROUND ECONOMY OF DANCERS I'VE HEARD THAT A LOT. WHICH REALLY CONCERNS ME BECAUSE THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW AND I I READ IT IN STATEMENTS BY YOU KNOW KNOWN FIGURES ON I GUESS AND ALL BEDS. THIS IDEA THAT SOMEHOW THIS SHIP'S YOU'RE RESPONSIBLE I PAY TAXES ON THE WORKER IS NOT TRUE. IS THAT TRUE. THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT RESPOND RIGHT IF THEY'RE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ESPECIALLY THEY HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO PAY TED TO PAY ON THEIR OWN SO IT IS A MATTER OF IS A BEING PULLED OUT OF YOUR PAYCHECK NOW OR ARE YOU PAYING IT AT A DIFFERENT TIME. THAT'S RIGHT EXACTLY I WON I WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT WAS REALLY A CLEAR FOR FOLKS AS WELL. NOW THE DIFFERENCE OF COURSE IS IS THE EMPLOYER'S RESPONSIBILITY THAT'S THE SHIFT WHEN YOU HAVE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR CREDIT YEP. ALL RIGHT ANOTHER QUESTION WITH -- THE WAGE IN ORDER -- RULING AND PREVIOUS RULINGS ON THIS CLASSIFICATION IN EMPLOYER NEVER HAS TO JUST PAY MINIMUM WAGE IS I I KNOW THAT SOUNDS LIKE AN OBVIOUS BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LIKE A A AN EMPLOYER CAN ALWAYS CHOOSE TO PAY MORE THAN MINIMUM WAGE CRACKED. OF COURSE YEAH OKAY WELL THIS IS A TO GET YOUR INCOMING YEAH YOU KNOW TO ME NOW SUDDENLY MY WAGES HAVE BEEN REDUCED TO THE MINIMUM WAGE THE EMPLOYER. OSTENSIBLY IS GETTING THE SAME VALUE OUT OF THAT WORKER THEY HAVE JUST CHOSEN TO PAY THEM LESS IF THEY'RE CHEAP PLANE A MINIMUM WAGE CRACKED YES AND AND I WOULD JUST SAY LIKE AS A AS A BROADER POINT. SOME OF WHAT -- PROFESSOR TO BALL MENTIONED ABOUT SAID EMPLOY WAGES -- BECAUSE OF THE DYNAMICS DECISION THAT'S EMPLOYERS CHOICE ON THE STRUCTURE THINGS THAT WAY YEAH OKAY I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT WAS REALLY CLEAR -- BECAUSE I THINK A LOT OF THINGS ARE SAID I AND I'M SORRY TO GO HERE ON THIS AND I DON'T KNOW IF ANY OF YOU KNOW THE ANSWER TO THIS -- AND ASKING A QUESTION I KNOW THE ANSWER TO IS KIND OF UNFAIR BUT DO ANY OF YOU HAVE ANY DO YOU TRACK THE EXOTIC DANCER LAWSUITS. AND SO IS IN FACT DYNAMICS DID NOTHING TO CHANGE THE POSITION THEY WERE IN BECAUSE IN TWENTY TWELVE THERE WAS A CLASS ACTION TWENTY SEVENTEEN THERE IS A CLASS ACTION RIGHT THIS WAS. THEIR THEIR POSITION AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS FOR SOME PLACE HAD BEEN ALREADY SETTLED LAW IS THAT CORRECT YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THE GO AHEAD OF I MEAN THESE -- THE EXOTIC DANCER LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN GOING ON SINCE AT LEAST THE NINETEEN NINETIES -- IT. IS VERY CLEAR BASED ON MY OWN LEGAL ANALYSIS THAT THESE WORKERS ARE EMPLOYEES UNDER THE WEIGHT ORDERS UNDER WORKERS COMPENSATION LAWS UNDER UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE LAWS. BOTH UNDER THE BAROLO STANDARD THEY HAVE THE COMPLETE THE EXOTIC DANCE COMPANIES HAVE CONSISTENTLY LOST UNDER THE BRELO STANDARD. AS WELL AS UNDER -- UNDER THE A. B. C. TASK THE DYNAMICS TEST SO THE WOMEN THAT I HAVE SPOKEN TO WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THEIR WAGES HAVE DROPPED SINCE THE BUSINESS MODEL HAS CHANGED -- I THINK HAVE BEEN -- IT'S WHAT -- WHAT IS GOING ON IS THAT THE COMPANIES REFUSED TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LABOR? AND ARE TRYING TO MAINTAIN THEIR BOTTOM LINE FOR THEMSELVES -- WILL NOT SHIP APPROPRIATELY SHARING HOW MUCH THEY SHOULD BE SHARING WITH THE WITH THE WOMEN THEMSELVES -- AND SO I I FEEL LIKE THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF MISINFORMATION -- CAN'T PARTICULARLY -- WITH REGARD TO EXOTIC DANCERS. THANK YOU MAY I JUST HAVE ONE THING. TO THAT POINT. OF ONE OF THE YEAH. CHALLENGES OF TRYING TO SOLVE PROBLEMS OF THIS SORT BY MEANS OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION. TED THE MINUTE HAS ALL KINDS OF PROBLEMS IT ONE OF THEM. IS THE EASE WITH WHICH OUR BUSINESSES. ARE ARE CAN TRANSFORM THEMSELVES -- WHEN WE WERE LITIGATING VÃ  ON BEHALF OF TAXI DRIVERS -- WE WE ARGUED THAT THE THE STATE WHICH LASTED FOR A WEEK HAD TO BE RENEWED AT THE END OF EACH WEEK. WAS AN ASPECT OF CONTROL THAT THE COMPANY'S EXERCISED OVER THE DRIVERS WELL WHAT DID THEY DO DURING THE LITIGATION A LENGTH IN THE TERM OF THE LEASE. OR THEY MADE OTHER CHANGES THAT YOU CAN HAVE YOUR COUSIN DRIVE YOU CAN HAVE A HELPER OR WHATEVER -- AND THE SAME THING IS HAPPENING AND OTHER -- INDUSTRIES WHERE AND THIS IS THE GENIUS OF CAPITALISM OF COURSE THAT. THE COMPANIES -- FEEL A LEGAL THREAT AND THEY CHANGE THE WAY THEY DO THINGS TO AVOID THAT THREAT. AND IT IT JUST LEADS. HAS LED TO A MORASS OF LITIGATION AND CHANGING STRUCTURES -- THAT I THINK -- THE A. B. C. TEST HOLDS GREAT PROMISE IN TRYING TO BRING. A LITTLE CLARITY. TO I HAVE A LITTLE QUESTION FLEXIBILITY BECAUSE WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS MY OFFICE A LOT -- AND YOU WORK CLEAR IN THE LAW I'M AS FAR AS FAR AS DYNAMICS GOES IT DOESN'T INTERFERE WITH FLEXIBILITY ON WAIT AN HOUR. I WOULD TAKE THAT A STEP FURTHER BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW -- IN WHAT SITUATION IN AN EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER SITUATION -- CAN AN EMPLOYER NOT BE FLEXIBLE WITH A WORKER IS IS FLEXIBILITY A PORTION OF THE LOT WORKING OF AN EMPLOYER ALWAYS BE FLEXIBLE ON HOURS WORKED TIME PERIOD -- AND AND DESIRE TO WORK. OR IS THERE SOMETHING LAW THAT PREVENTS THAT. SO THE ONLY THING IN THE LAW THAT. THAT REALLY IMPACTS TIME IS OVERTIME PROTECTION SO IF YOU WORK FOR MORE THAN EIGHT HOURS A DAY OR FORTY HOURS A WEEK THEN YOU GET. OVERTIME AND WHEN THE FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT WAS PASSED THE REASON THAT THESE OVERTIME PROTECTIONS WERE INCLUDED WAS NOT JUST SO THAT WORKERS AND MADE MORE MONEY BUT ALSO SAID THAT THEY DIDN'T SPEND ALL OF THEIR TIME. WORKING ALL THE TIME -- THE THAT THE SHIFT THE IDEA OF A SHIP'S TWITCH KANE CAME OUT OF SCIENTIFIC MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES DURING THE INDUSTRIAL REVOLUTION IS NOT ENDEMIC TO HOW WE REGULATE WORK -- FOR EXAMPLE IF -- IF YOU ARE AN ATTORNEY LIKE AND LIKE I AM AND YOU WORK AT A LAW FIRM. YOU CAN LOG YOUR HOURS A NIGHT AID AND GET PAID THAT WAY IF YOU ARE AN UBER DRIVER YOU CAN TURN ON YOUR APP. AND AND THAT THE COMPANY KNOWS EXACTLY HOW LONG YOU'VE WORKED FOR WHAT YOU GET PAID FOR IS THE TIME THAT YOU WORK WHETHER OR NOT YOU WORKING A SHIFT IS A BUSINESS DECISION. THAT IS SEPARATE FROM -- SEPARATE FROM THE THE LEGAL STANDARD SO THIS NOTION OF FLEXIBILITY WHEN PEOPLE SAY I WANT TO DO THIS BECAUSE I WANT A FLEXIBLE WORKPLACE. THAT IS ALWAYS IN THE HANDS OF THE EMPLOYER TO OFFER AN EMPLOYEE OF FLEXIBLE WORK PLACES THAT NOT TRUE YEAH WHETHER I AM WRITING A WHOLE BOOK ABOUT THIS. ABOUT THE MISCONCEPTIONS ABOUT FREEDOM AND FOR EXTRA FLEXIBILITY IN THE WORKPLACE AND WORKERS TAKE THE THEM NOT JUST WORKERS SMALL BUSINESS PEOPLE EVERYONE TAKES THIS IDEA REALLY SERIOUSLY NO ONE WANTS TO BE UNDER THE THUMB OF THE BOSS. NO ONE THAT'S WHY I BECAME A LAW PROFESSOR -- YOU KNOW I I DEEPLY UNDERSTAND THE DIGNITY DIGNITY ISSUES INVOLVED HERE AND AND CONFLATING THESE TWO THINGS BASICALLY PER STANDARDS AND FRIEDMAN FLEXIBILITY. AS AN EMPLOYER LINE THAT -- THAT I THINK A DOES A DISSERVICE TO PEOPLE WHO ARE WHO ARE PRODUCING THE WEALTH FOR THE COMPANIES. SIMMER OF THIS AND ONE OF TIME RIGHT NOW AND ONE MORE QUESTION BETTER OKAY I'M SORRY BECAUSE THESE ARE ALL LIKE I JUST WANT TO GET ON THE TABLE LIKE TRUTHS. SO AS WE MOVE FORWARD WE DON'T WE DON'T OPERATE IN THAT FIELD HOPEFULLY -- SO JUST ONE MORE PLEASE SO -- IS THERE IN FACT IN AGAIN I I JUST WANT AN EXPLANATION AND PROBABLY ANOTHER PANEL COULD SPEAK MORE TO THIS BUT THERE OUR BUSINESS MODELS ARE THERE ARE EMPLOYMENT MODELS WHERE BY. A WORKER WORKS FOR MULTIPLE COMPANIES THROUGH A CENTRALIZED PLACE AND THEIR WORKERS COMPENSATION IS PAID THEIR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE IS PAID AT MINIMUM WAGES THEY HAVE SICK TIME THEY HAVE. VACATION PAY THAT THAT'S TRUE RIGHT THERE IS THAT THE NOTION OF A HIRING HALL OR ON THE AS WE ALWAYS SAY THE INITIAL GET WORKER THROUGH AT A UNION HIRING HALL HAS BEEN AROUND FOR DECADES IS THAT TRUE WHERE WHERE ALL THE PROTECTIONS. THE PROTECTIONS FOR THE STATE WITH THE MONEY COMING AND THE PROTECTIONS FOR THE WORKER AND THE PROTECTIONS FOR THE EMPLOYER TAKING CARE OF IT IN AN PROVIDING. COMPLETE FLEXIBILITY AS THAT IS CORRECT NO THAT'S THAT'S ABSOLUTELY TRUE IN INDEED TAKE MODE OF PAYMENT IS ALSO -- IS IT CAN BE QUITE FLEXIBLE PIECE WORK -- IS. IS STILL AFFECTING STILL WAFFLE AND AS LONG AS THE RATE OF PAY ON A PIECE WORK IS. IS SUCH THAT. MINIMUM WAGES ASSURED -- EMPLOYERS ARE FREE EMPLOYEES ARE FREE. TO WORK BY THE PEACE AND YET IN THAT ASPECT THOUGH THEY'RE STILL BENEFITS THAT ARE ARE OWED IN PAGE TO BOTH THROUGH THE STATE AND TO THE WORKER CRAP EARLY I REMEMBERED OR COMPACTLY NEST LINES FARM WORKER OVER TIME AND ON SICK DAYS THAT STILL EXISTS. RIGHT OKAY THANK YOU GUYS THANK YOU THANK YOU AND AND I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL. FOR BEING HERE AND FOR YOUR AT IT IS -- AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER TO STUFF I KNOW I KNOW I I KNOW THE WEATHER'S PRETTY -- PRETTY CRAZY OUT THERE SAYS WE SWITCH THE PANEL AND BUT AGAIN I WANT TO THANK THIS PANEL AS WELL AS THE THE QUESTIONS WE DO DEFINITELY THE MOST OF THE AREA WE WANT THE MOST FLEXIBILITY AS MEMBERS ASKING QUESTIONS SO. I'LL BE A LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBLE THERE BUT WE STILL WANT TO TRY TO MOVE THIS ALONG ACCORDING TO SCHEDULE. AND SO -- THE NEXT AS THEY MAKE THEIR WAY UP ODDS INTRODUCED THE NEXT PANEL. OF THE INDUSTRIES -- PERSPECTIVE ON DYNAMICS -- AND BOTH OF THE INDUSTRY PANEL AS WELL AS THE EMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE WE COULD HAVE HAD. YOU KNOW HE COULD HAVE TEN TWENTY PEOPLE ON EACH OF THESE PERSPECTIVE SO I APOLOGIZE TO THOSE THAT MAYBE IT WOULD HAVE PREFERRED TO BE ON THE PANEL FOR BOTH OF THE NEXT TWO BATTLES. BUT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO DO SOME PICKING AND CHOOSING I HOPE WE CLEARLY ARE SHOWING SOME DIVERSITY IN THE THE PANELISTS THAT WE HAVE ASKED TO JOIN US AND SO WE DO HAVE JENNIFER BARRERA. THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE COURTNEY JENSEN LÃ  TECHNET. AND THE RESUME DOCTORS AND JOHN NORWOOD BUT THE INSURANCE AGENTS AND FOR THIS BATTLE IN THE NEXT PANEL WAS THE EMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE PANEL -- THE TIME ALLOTMENTS FOUR MINUTES EACH AND THEN WE'LL HAVE OPPORTUNITY FOR QUESTIONS FOR Q. NA AFTER THAT AS WELL AND AND ALSO. SERVICE SIMILARLY TO THE THE LAST PANEL -- ANY PRESENTATIONS POWER POINTS INFORMATION YOU WANT US TO HAVE OR TO BE PUT ON THE PUBLIC DOMAIN -- WILL CERTAINLY MAKE SURE THAT WE DO THAT AS WELL. AND SO -- A JENNIFER WHENEVER YOU'RE READY. I THINK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS GOOD MORNING AND THANKS FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS SUCH AN IMPORTANT ISSUE IS THE DYNAMICS DECISION I DID HAVE PLANNED REMARKS BUT I THINK I'M GONNA JUMP AROUND A LITTLE BIT JUST SOME OF THE DISCUSSION OF THE PRIOR PANEL AND ADDRESSING. THE ISSUES -- AS MENTIONED BEFORE THE BRELO STANDARD WAS THE STANDARD IN EFFECT FOR APPROXIMATELY THIRTY YEARS BEFORE THE DYNAMICS DECISION WAS ISSUED AND DESPITE THAT PRIOR COMMENTS WE BELIEVE THAT IT WAS A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE STANDARD -- THE ELEVEN FACTORS THAT WILL BE REALIZED IN THAT BRELO DECISION WAS THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO MEET EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THOSE FACTORS YOU LOOK THAT KIND OF THE OVERALL -- SITUATION AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THEY FELT MORE ON THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR SIDE OR THE EMPLOYEE SIDE YES WHETHER YOU'RE WORKING IN THE SAME BUSINESS AS THE HIRING AND TO BE WAS A FACTOR BUT IT WASN'T ONE OF THE MANDATORY FACTORS THAT HAD TO BE. MET AND IT WAS LARGELY FOCUSED ON THE RIGHT TO CONTROL THAT THE HIRING A TV HAD OVER THAT INDIVIDUAL THAT WAS A STANDARD IN PLACE FOR OVER THIRTY YEARS AND THEN THIS DECISION COMES DOWN AND OVERNIGHT THE STANDARD IS CHANGED. WITHOUT A LOT OF NOTICE TO EMPLOYERS WITHOUT A LOT TO CLEAN THE SHIFT. THE ABC TEST I'M NOT GONNA ROMANTICIZED BRILLO DECISION I AGREE WITH THE JUDGE'S COMMENTS THAT IT CAUSED A LOT OF CONFUSION AND LITIGATION FOR BOTH EMPLOYERS AND EMPLOYEES. HOWEVER NOW THE A. B. C. TEST IN THE RESTRICTIVE NATURE THAT THE EMPLOYER COMMUNITY THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO ARE FACING IT. BELIEVE IS THAT IT WILL ELIMINATE THE POTENTIAL FOR OPPORTUNITY AND CREATE THE SAME AMOUNT OF LITIGATION OBVIOUSLY BE A FACTOR FOCUSES ON THE RIGHT TO CONTROL WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT THE ROLE OF FACTOR OBVIOUSLY ARBELLA FACTORS OBVIOUSLY FOCUSED ON THE B. FACTOR. THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS THAT THIS IS THE MAIN DISTINCTION I WOULD SAY BETWEEN THE BRELO IN THE A. B. C. YOU HAVE TO SATISFY ALL THREE OF THESE FACTORS IF YOU GET TWO OUT OF THREE IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH YOU HAVE TO SATISFY ALL. THREE AND WELL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES -- THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS -- FOR IT MAY BE QUITE CLEAR FOR EXAMPLE -- WE HAVE EXPERTS APPEAR FROM OTHER INDUSTRIES BUT IN THE HEALTH CARE SITUATION IT WOULD BE VERY DIFFICULT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL PERFORMING MEDICAL SERVICES AT A HOSPITAL TO SAY THEY WEREN'T PERFORMING THE USUAL COURSE OF THE HIRING ENTITY. AND UNDER THAT CIRCUMSTANCE THEY COULD NOT BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR HOWEVER THERE'S ALSO CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE A LOT MORE GRAY AN AMBIGUOUS OF WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE WITHIN THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS WHICH I THINK IS A CHALLENGE OF WHEN -- A STANDARD LIKE THIS IS TO ADOPTED THROUGH A COURT DECISION RATHER THAN THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS IS YOU DON'T HAVE THE BENEFIT OF DEFINING THE FULL SCOPE OF WHAT THAT FACTOR IS. IT'S GOING TO BE DEPENDENT UPON HOW RISK OF DETERMINING WHETHER OR NOT THEY FALL WITHIN THE USUAL COURSE OF BUSINESS AND THE LIABILITIES SIGNIFICANT YOU HEARD FROM THE PRIOR PANEL ALL OF THE WAGE AND HOUR ISSUES THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNEMPLOYMENT TAXES THE WORKERS COMPENSATION INSURANCE. THAT'S ALL BAR BORN BY THE HIRING ENTITY IF THEY FAIL TO CLASSIFY AN INDIVIDUAL CORRECTLY AND SO WE WILL BE A LOSS OF INTEREST IN A OPPORTUNITIES. FOR MILLIONS OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS RIGHT NOW AND WHO DEPEND ON THAT AS THEIR FINANCIAL RESOURCE -- WE TALKED ABOUT THE PROFESSIONALS I WANT TO DRUM TO THAT ISSUE WITH REGARDS THE WAGE ORDERS THE IDA OR NOTION -- AND I AGREED THAT THIS WAS ONLY A BASED UPON WAIT ORDERS WE'D ORDERS WHICH BY THE WAY HAVE NOT BEEN UPDATED REVISED OR REVIEWED FOR UP OVER FOURTEEN YEARS THAT WITH THE I. W. C. WAS DEFENDED IN TWO THOUSAND FOUR SO WE HAVE WAGE ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN REVIEWED. UPON WHICH THIS DECISION IS BASED AND THE NOTION THAT THIS IS ONLY GOING TO BE APPLICABLE TO WAIT ORDERS I THINK IT'S REALLY IFFICULT AND CHALLENGING FROM THE EMPLOYER PERSPECTIVE. THERE SO MUCH CROSSOVER BETWEEN THE WAGE ORDERS AND THE LABOR CODE THAT IT WOULD BE IMPOSSIBLE FOR AN EMPLOYER TO SIT THERE AND TELL AN INDIVIDUAL YOU KNOW WHAT FOR THE WAGE ORDERS WE'RE GOING TO TREAT YOU AS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AN EMPLOYEE. AND FOR THE LABOR CODE VICE VERSA IT'S JUST AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION THAT'S ACTUALLY NOT GOING TO HAPPEN I ALSO RESPECTFULLY DISAGREE THAT THE PROFESSIONALS WHO ARE EXEMPTS UNDER THE WAGE ORDERS ARE THEREFORE NOT. IMPACTED BY THE DYNAMICS DECISION EXEMPTIONS UNDER THE WAGE ORDERS ARE ONLY FOR CERTAIN SECTIONS OF THOSE WAIT ORDERS IT'S OVERTIME MINIMUM WAGE A REST BREAKS IN MIL BREAKS MEANING YOU'RE A SALARIED EMPLOYEE. AND SO YOU'RE EXEMPT FROM THOSE PROVISIONS THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT FROM THE ENTIRE WAGE ORDER AND THEY'RE NOT EXEMPT FROM THE DEFINITION TO SUFFER OR PERMIT WHICH IS THE WHOLE DEFINITION THAT IS FOCUSED ON THE DYNAMICS DECISION BASICALLY. BEFORE YOU EVEN GET TO WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE A SALARIED EMPLOYEE YOU HAVE TO FIRST MAKE THE DISTINCTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AND EMPLOYEE AND THAT'S THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND SO ALL OF THOSE PROFESSIONALS WHO MAY. BE EXEMPTS IF THEY'RE DETERMINED TO BE AN EMPLOYEE UNDER THE WAGE ORDERS MAY NOT EVER GET THERE BECAUSE THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAKE THAT AT NATIONAL DETERMINATION BETWEEN ABC. AND THE DEPEND CONTRACTORS MY TIME READY UP CHEESE AGO I PROMISE OKAY. I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THAT WITH THE RISK OF LIABILITY IN KIND OF THE STRICT NATURE SOME THE WAGE AND HOUR LAWS IN CALIFORNIA IT DOES LIMÃ³N AN EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO GIVE FLEXIBILITY TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS WHICH IS WHY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WANT TO MAINTAIN. IT WOULD BE VERY CHALLENGING FOR EMPLOYER JUST TO SAY SHOW UP WHENEVER YOU WANT YOU CAN LEAVE WITH AN EVER YOU WANT AND STILL MAINTAIN THE BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THEIR BUSINESS. LAST AND FINAL POINT THAT I WANT TO BRING UP -- BUT NOBODY HAS ADDRESSED YET IS RETROACTIVITY THE COURT WHEN IT ISSUED ITS DECISION TO NOT JUST SPECIFIED THT THIS IS ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS ACTUALLY OPENED UP THE DOOR THAT THIS COULD BE APPLIED ON A RETROACTIVE BASIS. AND I THINK IT IS EXTREMELY AND PATENTLY UNFAIR FOR A BUSINESS TO BE HELD RESPONSIBLE FOR A STANDARD THAT HAD NEVER APPEARED BEFORE IN ANY COURT DECISION HAD NEVER APPEARED BEFORE IN ANY STATE STATUTE. AND HOLD THEM RETROACTIVELY LIABILITY FOR COMPLAIN WITH A LOT THE TIME WHICH WAS THE BRELO FACTORS AND SO I THINK IT'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO INTERVENE AND PROVIDE CLARITY ON THIS ISSUE. ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TO RETROACTIVITY IS ABOUT THANK YOU THANK YOU AND AND AND TO BE CERTAIN THIS IS NOT LAST AND YOU'RE GONNA BE HEARD ON THE ROOF AND HAVE A CHANCE. TALKING ABOUT THIS SO PLEASE LIKE YOU KNOW EXCUSE THE THE TIME LIMITATIONS WANNA MAKE SURE THAT WE HEAR FROM. AS MANY FOLKS AS POSSIBLE -- AND THE COURTNEY JENSEN TECHNET ALWAYS HARD FOLLOWING CHEN BUT SO GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS COURT IN JENSEN WITH TECH MATT THANK YOU FOR HOLDING THIS INFORMATIONAL HEARING INVITING TECHNET TO OFFER TESTIMONY. TECHNET REPRESENTS OVER EIGHTY COMPANIES ON THE TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION ECONOMY THE INDUSTRY TAKES THIS DECISION VERY SERIOUSLY GIVEN THE SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IT COULD HAVE ON THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND THE AVAILABILITY OF FLEXIBLE WORK. OPPORTUNITIES TO DATE THERE HAVE BEEN NUMEROUS DISCUSSIONS BETWEEN TECH COMPANIES IN LABOR AND WE APPRECIATE THE COLLABORATIVE NATURE OF THOSE MEETINGS WE BELIEVE PROGRESS IS BEING MADE AND I WANT TO EMPHASIZE OUR CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO FINDING AN INNOVATIVE SOLUTION. AT TECH NOT WE BELIEVE THE ISSUE IS NOT IF WE SHOULD SO IN AN ERA OF FLEXIBLE WORK THE DEBATE IS NOT IF WE OFFER BENEFITS TO WORKERS WHO FREELANCE BUT HOW WE MAKE THOSE BENEFITS DO THE MOST GOOD FOR THE MOST PEOPLE. WHILE ALSO REFLECTING THE ECONOMIC REALITIES AND THE UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES OF WORKERS OUR MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE FOUND COLLABORATIVE THOUGHT PARTNERS IN THE ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE AND LABOR ON A VARIETY OF TOPICS FROM WORKER VOICE TO WORKER BENEFITS. AS SUCH CALIFORNIA UNIQUELY POSITIONED DEVELOP A SOLUTION THAT IS BOTH PRO INNOVATION AND PRO WORKER AND THAT COULD BE A MODEL FOR THE NATION. WHILE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS CHOOSE TO EARN MONEY THROUGH ON DEMAND PLATFORMS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT FLEXIBLE WORK OPPORTUNITIES DO NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT. IN SEPTEMBER TWENTY EIGHTEEN AND NOW SAYS FROM BEACON ECONOMICS FOUND IN CALIFORNIA FIVE EMPLOYEES HAVE BEEN ADDED FOR EVERY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR JOB FROM. TWENTY TEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN FURTHER THE MOST WIDELY RECOGNIZED RESEARCH ON THE GIG ECONOMY THE TWENTY SIXTEEN CATS KRUEGER STUDY WAS RECENTLY UPDATED TO SHOW THAT THE GROWTH. OF ALTERNATIVE WORK ARRANGEMENT HAS ACTUALLY NOT BEEN HAS ACTUALLY BEEN MUCH LESS THAN BELIEVED A TREND IN DATA REPORTED BY THE US BUREAU OF LABOR STATISTICS ALSO. THE BUTTE AND THE BEACON ECONOMICS THEY CONCLUDED THAT A WHOLESALE RE CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS WOULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCES FOR A VARIETY OF DIFFERENT SECTORS IN THE STATE'S ECONOMY. SINCE THE NATURE OF IN RELIANCE ON INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING VARIES BY INDUSTRY A ONE SIZE FITS ALL POLICY IGNORES THE COMPLEXITY AND NEW WANTS OF SUCH WORK ARRANGEMENTS AND THE VALUE THEY BRING TO THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY. WHILE THERE ARE IMPORTANT ON NUANCES EVEN WITHIN THE ON DEMAND ECONOMY ONE CONSTANT IS THAT THE ON DEMAND WORKERS ENJOY THE FREEDOM TO CHOOSE WHEN AND WHERE THEY WANT TO WORK. HOW LONG THEY WILL WORK AND WHICH TRIPS DELIVERIES OR OTHER GIGS THEY WANT TO DO? IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THE COMMONALITY IN THIS DECISION FOR ALL COMPANIES TECH AND NON TECH IS PRONGS BNC OF THE A. B. C. TEST. ASSUMING THAT A COMPANY FAILS THE B. AND OR SEE PRONGS AND THAT COMPANIES WORKERS CAN NO LONGER BE CLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THE EFFECTS WOULD BE AS FOLLOWS COMPANIES COULD NOT SUSTAIN THE FLEXIBLE ON DEMAND MODEL THEY HAVE TODAY IT WOULD NOT BE VIABLE TO LAOS SOMEONE WHO QUALIFIES. FOR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS TO WORK JUST ONE TO TWO HOURS AND AS HIGH. AS A RESULT DELIVERY DRIVER PROVIDERS AND TNC DRIVERS WHICH INCLUDE SINGLE PARENTS WORKERS RETIREES ON FIXED INCOME WHO NEED MORE FLEXIBLE SCHEDULES WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO WORK AT ALL THE IMPACT WE SQUARELY PLACED ON WORKERS WHO CAN'T. OR DON'T WANT TO OBTAIN ANY TYPE OF TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT. WORKERS COULD NO LONGER DECIDE THEY DON'T WANT A LONGER DRIVE OR LARGER ORDER COMPANIES WOULD HAVE TO IMPOSE A HIGHER REQUIREMENT TO BE A SHOPPER DRIVER TO ENSURE EVERY SHOPPER DRIVER CAN DO EVERY ORDER. INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT FLEXIBILITY OF REJECTING ONES THEY CAN'T DO. RECOGNIZING THE SOCIETAL NEED COMPANES HAVE DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE WAYS TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT WORKERS THAT INCLUDE OFFERING OCCUPY OCCUPATIONAL ACCIDENTS DURRANCE HEALTH AND SAFETY PROTECTIONS. UPSCALING OPPORTUNITIES SAME DAY ACCESS EARNINGS AND MORE HOWEVER GIVEN THE STRICT NATURE OF THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA LABOR LAW THERE ARE MANY INHIBITORS TO COMPANIES BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL BENEFITS WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS OF WORKERS. THIS IS WHY WE SUPPORT REFORMS TO MODERNIZE EMPLOYMENT LAW WHICH ENABLE COMPANIES TO PIONEER MORE FORMS OF BENEFITS WITHOUT SACRIFICING THE FLEXIBILITY WORKERS ENJOY. TECHNOLOGY HAS ENABLED A VALUABLE NOT VALUABLE NEW FORM OF WORK THAT GIVES WORKERS THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK FLEXIBLY. TO BUILD THEIR BUSINESSES AND TO EASE THE IMPACT OF INCOME VOLATILITY INNOVATION HAS SUPPORTED MANY WORKERS AND THEIR FAMILIES AS WELL AS RETAIL AND RESTAURANT AND OTHER SMALL BUSINESSES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE ECONOMICALLY THREATENS. THE TECH COMMUNITY HAS ROLLED UP ITS SLEEVES AND WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE DISCUSSIONS WITH WORKERS LABOR AND THIS COMMITTEE. WE THANK YOU FOR ENGAGING WITH US AND WITH YOUR LEADERSHIP WE BELIEVE WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT ALLOWS CALIFORNIA TO CREATE A MODEL THAT IS PRO INNOVATION AND PRO WORKER. THANK YOU FOR DAM. THANK YOU MISS JOHNSON -- UP NEXT REPRESENT DOCTORS. TO MADDEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS TO MATT AND REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS -- I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO COME TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AND OUR ORGANIZED I THINK WITH MISS BERRA KINDA HITTING ON THE POINTS ON HOW THE DYNAMICS DECISION A IMPACTS US ALL FOCUS MORE ON HOW WE'RE STRUCTURED. BOTH HIS EMPLOYERS AND AS WORKERS SO LITTLE BIT OF BACKGROUND IS -- MANY OF YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA LAW DOES NOT ALLOW HOSPITALS TO EMPLOY A PHYSICIAN'S THIS IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS THE BAR ON THE CORPORATE PRACTICE OF MEDICINE. FAR PHYSICIANS ARE ARE NOT EMPLOYEES OF HOSPITALS THERE ARE SOME EXCEPTIONS TO THIS RULE AS A RELEASE TO COUNTY HOSPITALS AND CLINICS AND SOME CHAIRED ORGANIZATIONS. BUT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS WE CANNOT BE EMPLOYED BY HOSPITALS. I'M. HOW WE ARE ORGANIZED IS MERCY FISSIONS FORM TOGETHER AND EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS MEDICAL GROUP SO LET'S SAY FOR EXAMPLE THIS COMMITTEE YOU'RE ALL BURN SUFFICIENT YOU COME TOGETHER TO FORM AN ORGANIZATION? COULD BE CORPORATION COULD BE A PARTNERSHIP AND YOU SAY OKAY WERE INTO STAFF EMERGENCY DEPARTMENTS YOU GO TO HOSPITALS. SUTTER FOR EXAMPLE IN TOWN HERE. WOULD WE AGREE TO STACK YOUR HOSPITAL ON A TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BASIS AND FOR THAT WE RETAINED YOU RETAIN THE RIGHT TO BILL AND COLLECT ON YOUR OWN. SO WHATEVER PATIENTS WALK INTO THE MERGER DEPARTMENT REGARDLESS OF WHAT INSURANCE THEY HAVE OR WHAT THEY DON'T HAVE. THOSE ARE YOUR CUSTOMERS FOR LACK OF A BETTER WORD. I'M AND THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE YOUR BUSINESS A WORKER SIDE IT'S VERY COMMON FOR EMERGENCY PHYSICIANS AS A WORKER TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. AND THIS IS FOR A COUPLE REASONS. MANY OF OUR FOLKS LIKE WORKING IN DIFFERENT FACILITIES SEE MADE SO MYSELF IF I'M AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN I MAY WANT TO WORK AT SAUDER. BUT IT MAY HAVE FAMILY IN MARYSVILLE OR MAY WANT TO DO SOME SHIFTS IN READING SO I COULD COME AND DO SOME SHOWS FOR USE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUT THEN I CAN GO. AND HAVE FLEXIBILITY DO SHIPS IN ANOTHER LOCATION. ON THIS MADE IN THE FIRST PANEL TALKED ABOUT ANOTHER ASPECT WHICH I THINK IS UNIQUE TO PROFESSIONALS PARTICULARLY PHYSICIANS. WHICH IS RESOURCES AND BARGAINING POWER TO BEING HIGHER WAGE EARNERS -- WE ARE IN A POSITION TO PAY FOR THE BENEFITS THAT YOU COMMONLY SEE IN THAT EMPLOYER EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIP -- ON THE BARGAINING POWER PERSPECTIVE AS WE ALL KNOW THERE IS A PHYSICIAN SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. ANOTHER UNFORTUNATE REALITIES THAT GIVES PHYSICIANS SOME BARGAINING POWER SO THEY'RE IN A POSITION WHERE THEY CAN MAKE THAT CHOICE ON WHERE THEY WANT TO WORK. A GOING BACK TO THE HOSPITAL MODELED AND ANOTHER UNIQUE ASPECT IS. WE COME AND WE DON'T PROVIDE ANY OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT THE HOSPITAL JOB AS WELL AS THE SUPPLIES WE MAY HIGHER PHYSICIAN ASSISTANTS SO WE HANDLE THE STAFFING DECISIONS. SO WE DECIDE HOW MANY PHYSICIANS WILL BE AND NOT HOSPITALS THAT'S ANOTHER UNIQUE ASPECT OF THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE HOSPITALS AND PHYSICIAN'S. ARM. OUR FOLKS WE FIND LIKE BEING INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO GETS BACK TO THE POINT OF THEM HAVING THE FLEXIBILITY. TO WORK IN DIFFERENT LOCATIONS -- FROM A BUSINESS PERSPECTIVE IT DOES PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO THE EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN GROUP PARTICULARLY IN RURAL IN THE INNER URBAN AREAS WHERE IT CAN BE HARD TO RECRUIT PHYSICIANS. NOT IT'S BEEN TALKED ABOUT THAT BENEFITS COULD BE AS MUCH AS 30%. THAT CAN BE DIFFICULT FOR A FACILITY IN DOWNTOWN LOS ANGELES WERE 81% OF THE PATIENTS THEY SEE OR MEDI CAL ENROLLEES SO IF YOU'RE TRYING TO RUN A BUSINESS AND YOU HAVE 81% OF YOUR CUSTOMERS ARE MEDI CAL ENROLLEES. ON YOUR YOU WANT TO HAVE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN TERMS OF HOW YOU -- PAY PHYSICIANS SO THAT'S A SNAPSHOT OF HOW WE'RE ORGANIZED I'M GLAD CA FITTED IN UNDER FOUR MINUTES IN OBVIOUSLY AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THAT THE DOT THE DOCTORS LED THE THE THE THE DOCTORS REP IN THE JUDGE -- THEM ON TIME. AND THAT AROUND ON THIS PANEL -- JOHN NOR WOULD WITH THE INSURANCE AGENTS SHERMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU -- JOHN NORWOOD REPRESENTING INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS BROKERS I ALSO HAVE THE PRIVILEGE TODAY OF REALLY SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE ENTIRE INSURANCE INDUSTRY -- I THINK ACROSS ALL LINES OF INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA AND AND THEY NATIONALLY THE DOMINANT AND PREFERRED -- DELIVERY SYSTEM OR SALES MECHANISM FOR INSURANCES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AS FAR AS I KNOW IT'S BEEN THAT WAY FOR OVER A HUNDRED YEARS -- OUR MEMBERS MOST OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IN BUSINESS FOR HIM TO OVER GENERATIONS AND REPRESENT NUMEROUS INSURANCE COMPANIES EITHER HAS APPOINTED AGENTS OR IN HOUSE -- IT AS BROKERS -- THEY HAVE THEIR OWN BUILT ON EMPLOYEES BY THEIR INSURANCE PAY THEIR TAXES ON THE RENEWALS AND CAN SELL THEIR BUSINESSES. THE SAME IS TRUE OF OTHER -- DELIVERY SYSTEMS IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS FOR INSTANCE INSURANCE AGENTS THAT ARE -- ASSOCIATED PRIMARILY WITH ONE INSURANCE COMPANY AND THE LIFE FOR HEALTH BUSINESS OR IN THE PROPERTY CASUALLY BUSINESS SUCH AS STATE FARM FARMERS ALL STATE. THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS REALLY THAT THEY REPRESENT YOUR FEWER INSURERS MADE PRIMARILY THEY'RE PLACING BUSINESS WITH ONE INSURER BUT THEY HAVE OPTIONS WITH REGARD TO PLACING WITH OTHER INSURERS. SOMETIMES THROUGH DIFFERENT KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS SOMETIMES UNDER FOR TRY REFUSALS EXCEPT FOR BUT ESSENTIALLY THEY'RE THE SAME AS OUR MEMBERS THEY RUN THEIR OWN BUSINESSES. THEY OWN THE RENEWALS I CAN SELL THEIR BUSINESSES THAT TYPE OF THING EVEN IN THE DIRECT WRITER SPACE -- BUT THE GUY CODES -- AUTO CLUBS AND THINGS LIKE THAT COMPANIES CAN EMPLOYEE -- OF LICENSE CALL CENTERS AND TO HOME TO SELL AND OR SERVICE OR THEIR PRODUCTS IS A ONE OF A KIND OF VIRTUAL AN INSURANCE BUSINESS DONE THIS COUNTRY. THE INDUSTRY'S PROBLEM WAS DYNAMAX IS OBVIOUSLY THE BEEF HELP PRONG OF THE OF THE OF THE TESTIFIED INSURERS CITY IN A SITUATION WHERE THEY HAVE TO PROVE. THAT AND THEN AN AGENT -- IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR LIKE TO WORK THROUGH ALL WELL ISN'T AGENCY LAW CALIFORNIAN UNDER AGENCY LAW THE AGENT IS IN FACT THE COMPANY -- THEY ARE ABLE TO BIND COVERAGE -- EVEN THOUGH THE AGENT OR BROKER HAS THEIR OWN INSURANCE ARE OWNED BY THEIR BOND IF THE IF THERE'S MALFEASANCE THE LAWYERS GOING TO SELL THROUGH THE INSURANCE AGENT. AS WELL AS THE COMPANY SO THERE REALLY IN THAT POSSIBLE SITUATION AND FOR THAT THOSE REASONS WE STRONGLY FEEL THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. SOME CLARIFICATION FROM -- THE DYNAMICS DECISION -- WE WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP LANGUAGE ON THAT POINT SINCE OCTOBER OF LAST YEAR WE'VE HAD. DISCUSSIONS WITH ORGANIZED LABOR GROUPS AND VARIOUS KEY LEGISLATORS ON THIS ON THIS ISSUE -- I HAVE TO SAY THAT -- WITH. UP TO THIS POINT WE FEEL THOSE DISCUSSIONS ARE GOING VERY WELL -- DO SUBJECT TO SEEING LANGUAGE AND THAT'S EVERYTHING WHICH WE HAVEN'T SEEN YET THAT CONCEPTUALLY WE THINK -- SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IS -- IS -- IS POSITIVE AND ALL RULED IN SOME BROKERS PLAY IN THE IN THE IN IN THIS -- SALES MECHANISM SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH ALL THE OF THIS COMMITTEE AND MEMBERS AND OTHER THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISSIONAL WOULDN'T ALL THE PANELISTS I THINK THAT YOU KNOW FROM. EXOTIC DANCERS EMERGES FROM DOCTOR TO GET WORKERS INTO A MAGIC IT DEMONSTRATES OR THE COMPLEXITY. OF THE ISSUE BUT I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT THAT -- CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING THE PEOPLE AT LEAST ARE ARE TALKING TO ONE ANOTHER BECAUSE WE NEED TO ON AN ISSUE OF THIS. NATURE NO DOUBT ABOUT AND I HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS OR I HANDED OVER. I'M. AND SO. MISTER JENSEN -- BUT BE BE HEARD THE THE PANEL BEFORE TALKING ABOUT KIND OF A I THINK GHOST FASHIONABLE WAS TALKING ABOUT WILD. FREEDOM AND COMPLYING WITH WEIGHT ORDERS ARE TWO DIFFERENT THINGS WE DON'T FLEXIBILITY A COMBINED WAGE ORDERS ARE. FROM TWO SEPARATE THINGS YOU SEE. DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT AND AND I GUESS I I GUESS THE POINT IS THAT IF IF THE WAGE ORDER REQUIRES. BASIC MINIMUM STANDARDS ABOUT CALIFORNIA LAW REQUIRES NO MINIMUM WAGE AND OVERTIME WHAT HAVE YOU. WHO WOULD? WOULD THAT BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE ACCOMPLISHED WITHIN THE BUSINESS MODEL -- THAT PLAYERS -- THEM EMPLOY. THERE'S THE DRIVERS THAT DELIVERY OR WHAT HAVE YOU SO. SO -- I'LL START OFF BY SAYING YOU KNOW CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING AND SO WERE CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH ALL OF THE DIFFERENT PARTS OF THIS -- ISSUE AND ALL THE DIFFERENT PIECES OF BENEFITS SO LIKE CHEN MENTION LIKE WORKING IN A WAGE ORDERS IS JUST ONE PIECE OF IT WE'VE GOT A LOT OF OTHER PIECES THAT NEED TO BE. HASHED OUT BETWEEN DIFFERENT PIECES OF LAW AND SO WHAT WE BELIEVE IS THAT YOU KNOW THERE WE WANT FLEXIBILITY AND STABILITY AND SO HOW DO WE GET THERE -- AND HOW DO WE MAKE SURE THAT WE DO SO IN A WAY THAT THESE BUSINESSES CAN KEEP PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITIES THAT THEIR WORKERS HAVE TODAY -- AND THE THE ABILITY FOR CONSUMERS TO USE THESE PRODUCTS AND SO YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE STILL CONTINUING TO WORK THROUGH THAT PROCESS AND CONTINUING TO WORK WITH OUR MEMBER COMPANIES TO GET THERE -- AND THEY ARE WORKING AND DOING REALLY HARD WORK WITH -- ORGANIZED LABOR TO FIGURE THAT OUT -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND STABILITY CAN BE ACCOMPLISHED -- AND SO WE'RE WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GET THAT OF THE THE FLEXIBILITY BUT ALSO I MEAN HAVING THE BARE MINIMUM MAKING SURE THAT. YEAH AS I A CASE. HAS AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE AT LEAST -- HAS THEIR WORKING EX NUMBER HOURS THAT THEY GET COMPENSATED AT LEAST TO MEET THE THE LAW AND AS IT APPLIES THE WAGE ORDERS. SO I'M NOT GOING TO COMMENT ON SPECIFIC PIECES OF ME AND HIM AND AND I'VE I'M UP HERE REPRESENTING OUR ASSOCIATION AND NOT OUR INDIVIDUAL MEMBERS SO THAT YES YEAH WE'RE WORKING THROUGH ALL THOSE ISSUES -- BUT WHAT I SAID IN THE BEGINNING AS YOU KNOW WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S YOU KNOW IF WE PROVIDE BENEFITS IT'S HOW WE PROVIDE THOSE BENEFITS AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF DEVIL IN THE DETAILS THE ORDER CONTAINED WORK OUT THAT I DON'T MEAN. TO YEAH ACCOUNTS REPRESENT A TRAIN STATION -- INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES BUT AND AND THEN -- MISS BARRERA IS. AS THE THE CASE THE DYNAMICS CASE AS A APPLIES TO WAGE ORDERS THE INDICATED THAT -- BUT THERE'S A LOT OF CROSSOVER LABOR CODE WHAT HAVE YOU NOW IS THAT. A CROSSOVER DRUGS A PRACTICAL APPLICATION OR IS IT A CONCERN THAT THE COURTS WILL. THAT IT'LL BE IN TROUBLE IN A MORE EXPANSIVE VIEW EITHER BUT INTERPRETING DYNAMICS OR SUBSEQUENT. NO COURT RULINGS THAT MAY EXPANDED SO YOU HAVE TO KIND OF BE PREPARED. FOR THAT CROSSOVER YEAH I'M I THINK IT'S A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH -- I KNOW THERE IS A DECISION THAT SAID HEY THE DYNAMICS DECISION WAS ONLY APPLICABLE TO WAIT ORDERS AND NOT LABOR CO CLAIMS IN CERTAINLY WITH THAT CASE ITSELF BASE BUT THE LABOR CO CLAIMS AND THE WAGE ORDER CLAIMS. HOWEVER I'LL GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF HOW DIFFICULT IT WOULD BE TO CROSS OVER THERE'S A PROVISION THAT SAYS YOU HAVE TO REIMBURSE FOR TOOLS IN UNIFORM AND UNDER THE LABOR CODE IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO REIMBURSE FOR ALL EMPLOYEE RELATED EXPENSES. SO IF I BRING A CLAIM -- AND TOOLS UNIFORMED EQUIPMENT SKEWS ME UNDER THE WAGE ORDERS IF I BRING A CLAIM UNDER BOTH. YOU KNOW RIGHT FOR THE SAME EXPENSE AND I AL ALLEGE A CLAIM UNDER THE LABOR CODE PROVISION FOR MY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT AND ONE UNDER THE WAGE ORDER WHAT IS A CAR GOING TO DO WITH THAT. AND ARE YOU GOING TO BASICALLY DENIED THE CLAIM UNDER THE LABOR CODE AND SAY UNDER THE BROILER FACTORS YOUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR BUT ON THE WAGE ORDER YOUR A AN EMPLOYEE AND WHAT I MEAN HONESTLY WHAT IS THE DISTINCTION IN REALITY. MATTER TO SOME EXTENT RIGHT BECAUSE IT'S THE SAME CLAIM IS JUST BEING ALLEGED UNDER A DIFFERENT PROVISION AND AGAIN -- WITH YOUR AN EMPLOYEE UNDER ONE AND NOT INTO THE OTHER IT REALLY DOESN'T HAVE ANY ACTUAL. RESULT THAT'S MEANINGFUL AND DISTINCT AND SO I THINK IT WOULD BE WELL. WHILE THE DECISION -- WOULD BE SEEN AS LIKE OH THIS IS A A FAVOR IN THE GARCIA DECISION DYNAMICS -- JENNER'S I THINK IT JUST ADDS ANOTHER LAYER OF CONFUSION FOR EMPLOYERS -- AND BUSINESSES AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO ARE TRYING TO OPERATE IN THE SPACE ON HOW THEY NAVIGATE AND CLASSIFY INDIVIDUALS. THANK YOU -- MEMBERS. SOME OF HIS OFFICE I JUST WANT TO STATE THAT I TEND TO AGREE WITH YOU MISTER SOUTH AT THAT YEAH. YEAH. I I NEED EVERY. HAVE WE WOULD EVENTUALLY I THINK THROUGH COURTS GET DYNAMAX TO EVERYTHING -- WHICH IS WHAT THE STATE LAW NOW. JUST A REMINDER EVERYBODY I MEAN THAT IS THE STATE OF THE LAW -- SO I HAVE A QUESTION THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ANSWER TODAY AND I TOTALLY UNDERSTAND I'LL TAKE THE ANSWERS LATER BUT AND IN NO WAY STE SHOULD THE SUGGEST. A DIRECTION THAT I MOVING I'M JUST -- OUT OF CURIOSITY IT'S AN INTERESTING QUESTION WITH WITH EASE IS -- FOR ALL THREE OF THE DIFFERENT TYPES OF WORKERS AND I KNOW YOU'RE THE WORKERS UNDER ATTACK ARE KIND DIFFERENT BUT YOU KNOW DRIVER DELIVERY KIND OF THING -- YOUR COMPANIES AN AND YOUR WORKERS [inaudible] WHAT -- WHAT IS THE PROTOCOL OF SOMEBODY GETS HURT ON THE JOB? WHO PAYS FOR THAT HOW'S THAT PAID -- WHAT IS THE PERCENTAGE OF YOUR WORKERS THAT ARE ABLE TO PURCHASE AND SUBSIDIZED HEALTH CARE? HOW MUCH IS THE AVERAGE SALARY OF THE WORKERS IN YOUR FIELD? SO THOSE ARE ALL THREE JUST -- QUESTIONS. AT THE END OF POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH I BEEN TRYING TO GET THIS ANSWER FROM EVERYBODY FOR YEARS HOW MANY OF YOUR WORKERS ARE ON ANY SORT OF PUBLIC BENEFITS CAL FRESH CAL WORKS. PUBLIC HOUSING SUBSIDIZED HOUSING FREE LUNCH -- I DON'T THINK I'LL GET THAT ANSWER BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ASKING FOR A LONG TIME AND A BILL LIKE THAT WAS KILLED -- BUT YOU KNOW WE CAN ALWAYS TRY AGAIN BUT I THINK THESE ARE IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS WHEN WE TALK ABOUT THE STATE'S INTEREST IN WHAT WE'RE DOING HERE -- AND I WOULD LOVE TO HEAR IF YOU IF YOU KNOW ANY OF THOSE ANSWERS ARE BALLPARK IT IF NOT I CAN WAIT TO RECEIVE THOSE SUMMER CREEL [inaudible] HELLO [inaudible] IN. TWO THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- MISS JOHNSON I JUST -- I'M VERY CURIOUS I HAD A RECENT CONVERSATION -- WITH SOMEONE. WERE TALKING ABOUT THE FEDERAL WORKERS WHO ARE NOT -- ABLE TO RECEIVE. NO THEIR CELL -- A POTENTIAL PART TIME JOB SO THAT THEY CAN. PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE PAY THEIR RENT A VERY DIFFERENT I THINK -- SITUATION THE NORMALLY AND SOME ALSO JUST CURIOUS AS TO THE PERCENTAGE OF WORKERS THAT ENTER YOUR WORK FORCE THAT ARE. PART TIME TEMPORARY AND NOT NECESSARILY USING THIS AS A FULL TIME JOB AND WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THAT. AND FULL TIME EMPLOYERS THAT WERE TALK FULL TIME EMPLOYEES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SHOULD HAVE SOME OF THE BENEFITS THAT FULL TIME WORKERS. A SHOULD RECEIVE. YEAH -- WE CAN WE CAN GET BACK TO YOU WITH THEM US SPECIFIC STATISTICS ON THAT BUT JUST A AN INTERESTING PORT -- PORTION OF THAT THE THE DATA AND THE COMMENT I MADE EARLIER ABOUT THE CATS KRUEGER STUDY AND THE YEARS U. S. BUREAU OF STATISTICS LABOR STATISTICS EARLY ON IN THAT CITY FIRST CAME OUT IT WAS DURING THE RECESSION -- AND SO IT SAID THAT THERE IS LIKE THIS FIVE GET KIND OF AND THEN LATER ON BECAUSE OF WE WEREN'T IN THE RECESSION ANYMORE IT WAS ACTUALLY FOUND THAT THAT GROWTH WAS BETWEEN ONE POINT FIVE AND 2%. SO YOU DO SEE THAT DURING YOU KNOW RECESSIONS DOWN TURNS SITUATIONS LIKE WITH THE FEDERAL WORKERS AND I'M NOT GETTING PAID THAT THESE ARE OPPORTUNITIES FOR PEOPLE TO SUPPLEMENT THEIR INCOME OR DEAL WITH THE SITUATION WHEN THEY FIND THEMSELVES UNEMPLOYED OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT -- AND SO I'LL GET BACK TO YOU WITH SOME SPECIFICS ON DATA BETWEEN FULL TIME AND PART TIME AND PEOPLE WHO JUST USE IT -- YOU KNOW AS THEY NEED -- BUT JUST TO GIVE YOU A LITTLE BIT LATER THEIR GERMAN IF I COULD JUST ANSWER AS CONSOLES QUESTION BRIEFLY I THINK FROM OUR MEMBERS STANDPOINT. IN TERMS OF A SOMEBODY GOT INJURED ON THE JOB -- TO THE EXTENT OUR MEMBERS ARE THAT SOLE PROPRIETORSHIPS PARTNERSHIPS TO THINGS LIKE THAT A RUN INSURANCE AGENCIES THERE IN THE INSURANCE BUSINESS SO THEY KNOW ABOUT DISABILITY. INSURANCE AND WAYS TO TAKE CARE OF THEMSELVES FROM THAT STANDPOINT FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES OR EMPLOYEES ALL BE COVERED UNDER EXTENT YOU KNOW EXTENSIVE BENEFITS I DOUBT SERIOUSLY TO DON'T WANT I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE SALARY IS THAT OBVIOUSLY COULD. VARY WIDELY FROM SOMEBODY FRESH OUT OF COLLEGE SELLING LIFE INSURANCE TO SOMEBODY YOU KNOW DOING -- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN IN A NATIONAL BROKERAGE BUSINESS AND SO IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY WIDELY BUT I WOULD DOUBT THAT VERY MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE A ON ANY TYPE OF PUBLIC ASSISTANCE OR BELOW MINIMUM WAGE [inaudible] THANK. YEAH AND JUST FOLLOWING UP ON AS A RECOVERY I THINK THAT THE YOU KNOW WE HEAR ABOUT HOW THE WHOLE SIDE HUSTLE THING AND ALL THAT AND THERE ARE PEOPLE I KNOW PEOPLE THAT WORLD MAYBE FOR FIVE TEN HOURS A WEEK JUST KIND OF SUPPLEMENT. AND THAT CAUSED A WHOLE OTHER ISSUE WHETHER THEIR JOB IS PAYING THEM ENOUGH TO ACTUALLY SURVIVE ON BUT THAT'S A SEPARATE ISSUE. BUT THERE IS A DISTINCTION BETWEEN THOSE THAT ARE KIND OF DOING A JUST A SUPPLEMENTING COME A LITTLE BIT AND AND THOSE THAT ARE REALLY. THIRTY FORTY PLUS HOURS A WEEK AND SO THOSE THOSE HAVE TO GRAPPLE THIS LARGER ISSUE EVEN NOT NESTLE JUST ON THIS ONE ISSUE BUT JUST KIND OF THE WHOLE FUTURE OF WORK CONCEPT TO KINDA HOW PEOPLE ARE ARE WORKING -- WHAT WHAT OUR EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES IN TWENTY NINETEEN VERSUS WHAT THEY WERE TEN YEARS AGO AND YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT ARE THE PUBLIC POLICY RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT? SO THANK YOU SO MUCH ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS SERVICE -- FROM WHAT I SEE FROM YOUR INDUSTRIES -- ONE DIFFERENCE IS THE TYPE OF TRAINING OR SPECIALIZED SKILL RATE THAT. EACH OF YOUR INDUSTRIES HOUSE AND I YOU KNOW LIKE I THINK OF ANY OUR PHYSICIAN THE HOSPITAL. ISN'T TRAINING THE POSITION RIGHT THEY COME IN WITH THE SPECIALIZED SKILL. AND THEY'RE ABLE TO OPERATOR RUN THE EMERGENCY ROOM WHILE -- OTHERS YOU'RE PROBABLY ARE PROVIDING MORE TRAINING -- TO YOUR MEMBERS -- RATE I MEAN SO I GUESS I JUST THINK OF YOU KNOW THAT DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF WHETHER YOU'RE AN EMPLOYEE VERSUS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. TERMS OF THE AMOUNT OF TRAINING AND IF YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS ON THAT. THANK YOU SO REMEMBER TO MAD WITH EMERGENCY BINGE AND YOU'RE CORRECT SO POSITIONS GO TO RESIDENTS TO MEDICAL SCHOOL AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS AND COMING OUT OF RESIN TO BROWN'S AND THEY BEGIN TO WORK IT. DIFFERENT HOSPITALS SO WE'RE NOT RECEIVING ANY ADDITIONAL MEDICAL TRAINING FROM THE FACILITIES THEMSELVES. SO IN THAT SENSE WERE VERY MUCH INDEPENDENT IF WE DO -- RECEIVE ADDITIONAL TRAINING IS DONE TO CONTINUING MEDICAL EDUCATION WHICH AGAIN IS SEPARATE FROM -- HOSPITALS IS NOT DONE ON SITE IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S EACH INDIVIDUAL PHYSICIAN RESPONSIBLE FOR DOING IT ON THEIR OWN. WHAT WHY YOU GUYS ANSWER AND IF YOU COULD ADD TO THIS EIGHT I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT QUESTION AN AS YET? GREATLY SO WHERE WE DO HOLD A LICENSE THAT SO -- HELD OR OVERSEEN BY THE MEDICAL BOARD OF CALIFORNIA IT'S AN FOR OUR MEMBERS IN PET INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS IN THE INDUSTRY IN GENERAL A LICENSED INSURANCE PROFESSIONALS REGULATED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE. AND WE'RE TO GET THAT LICENSE -- SUBSTANTIAL PRE LICENSING EDUCATION AS WELL AS POST LICENSING EDUCATION CERTAINLY ARE ARE -- MEMBERS HELP YOU HELD THEIR SALES PEOPLE ON THEIR EMPLOYEES WITH THE EDUCATION -- BE A WITHIN THE THE AGENCY BUT THEY CAN GET THAT CONTINUE EDUCATION OUTSIDE THE AGENCY EASILY AS WELL. I WOULD JUST ADD TO THAT THAT -- IF THE HIRING ENTITIES ACTUALLY TRAINING ON A PARTICULAR ISSUE WERE PROJECT THAT WOULD PROBABLY GO TO THE CONTROL FACTOR -- WHICH IS THE FIRST FACTOR IN THE DYNAMICS DECISION AND SO THAT COULD -- DISTINGUISH THE TEST RIGHT THERE IF YOU'RE PROVIDING A LOT OF TRAINING TO THOSE INDIVIDUALS IN THAT IN THAT CAPACITY YEAH NOT THEM ECHO WHAT CHEN SAID IN AND THERE IS A DESIRE TO POR PER PRIDE MORE TRAINING BUT IT DOES OFTENTIMES PUT US IN CONFLICT -- AND THEN JUST TO BACK UP A LITTLE BIT SORRY I GO AND I HAVE LESS THAN -- PLUS HOURS A WEEK AND EIGHTY PLUS PERCENT LESS -- DRIVE LESS THAN THIRTY HOURS PER WEEK. THE AND ALWAYS HELPFUL AND WITH COMPANY OR IS THAT. FOR AT ITS TODAY FOR AN INDIVIDUAL COMPANY YET LL ITS FIRST IT HAS SIX AND I'LL GET BACK TO YOU AS OUT OF BROADER BECAUSE THAT IS DRIVERS AND WE ALSO HAVE -- DELIVERY PARTNERS AND WE ALSO HAVE OTHERS THAT WE'VE HEARD IN FACT FROM THE COMPANIES THEMSELVES THAT MULTIPLE PEOPLE WORK FOR MULTIPLE COMPANIES AT THE SAME TIME SO IT'S HOURS WORK FOR SAID IN AN YEAH I MEAN A CONSTRUCTION WORKER MIGHT ONLY WORK FOR ONE COMPANY FOR FIVE HOURS IN. A WEEK BUT MAY BE WORKING FORTY FIVE HOURS A WEEK SO IT FORK ANY CONSTRUCTION COMPANY. THIS IMMIGRANT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND JUST APPOINT A CLARIFICATION WE SAY DRIVERS DO YOU MEAN LIKE FOR LIKE COMPANIES THAT DO. THAT CAN PICK ME UP AND TAKE ME SOMEWHERE ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT LIKE DELIVERY SERVICES SO THAT'S WHAT I'M GONNA GET YOU KIND OF A BREAK DOWN BETTER OF DELIVERY VERSES YOU KNOW DELIVERY AM ACROSS THE INDUSTRY DELIVERY AND THEN ALSO DRIVERS -- TO PROVIDE TRANSPORTATION SERVICES. THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH I REALLY APPRECIATE IT WE ARE OVER AND WE WERE GOING OVER TIME BUT I I THIS BOOK I SAID THIS PORTION THE Q. AND IT IS OUR FIRST PUBLIC YOUR NAME. ON THIS ISSUES I THINK IS REALLY VALUABLE INSTRUCTIVE SO THANK YOU ALL -- AND NEXT UP WE HAVE -- THE EMPLOYEE PERSPECTIVE ON DYNAMICS -- CAITLYN VEGA WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. I THINK A COUPLE OTHER FOLKS COMING FALL YEAH -- THERE IS A CAESAR TIAS FROM THE BUILDING SHE BUILDING TRADES. WHATEVER IT IS THEY FELL. TO SAY SIR D. AS DOUG BLOCK. REDUCING TEAMSTERS AND DAVE WHERE THAT WITH SCA YOU U. S. DE ANSWERS [inaudible] AFTERWARD. AND IF THE EVERY WAY TO GO WILL GO AHEAD AND START WITH -- WITH MISS VEGA WITH THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE. IN THIS IMPORTANT HEARING. I WANNA BEGIN BECAUSE WE'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME OF THE MINIMAL STANDARDS THAT WORKERS ARE ENTITLED TO ENTER CALIFORNIA LAW. SO ONE BEGIN BY JUST NOTING WORKING PEOPLE FOUGHT AND DIED FOR EVERYONE OF THOSE PROTECTIONS FOR A MINIMUM WAGE FOR THE RIGHT TO AN EIGHT HOUR DAY FOR THE RIGHT TO JOIN THE UNION. AND THAT'S WHY MISS CLASSIFICATION IS SUCH A THREAT TO EVERYTHING THAT THE LABOR MOVEMENT BELIEVES IN. IT NOT ONLY TAKES AWAY EVERY RIGHT THAT EXISTS FOR WORKERS. IT TAKES AWAY THE RIGHT OF WORKERS TO COME TOGETHER AND FIGHT TO IMPROVE THEIR CONDITIONS. AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THEY ARE LEGALLY PROHIBITED FROM DOING THAT SO THEY START BELOW THE MINIMUM AND THEY ARE LEGALLY PROHIBITED FROM COMING TOGETHER TO TRY TO MAKE THEIR LIVES BETTER. NOW THE DYNAMICS DECISION I AGREE HAS BEEN -- MISUNDERSTOOD AND MIS CHARACTERIZED. THE DYNAMICS DECISION DOES NOT RESTRICT THE ABILITY OF ANY INDIVIDUAL TO GO INTO BUSINESS FOR THEMSELVES IT DOES NOT AFFECT TRUE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IT DOES NOT STOP ANYONE. FROM STARTING THEIR OWN BUSINESS. MEASURE THE THE DYNAMICS DECISION SPEAKS TO A BUSINESS MODEL WHERE A COMPANY USES AN ENTIRE GROUP OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO DO THE REGULAR WORK OF THEIR BUSINESS. THAT'S WHAT THE COURT IN THE DECISIONS IT. TRUE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS ARE FINE A COMPANY RESTING ABOVE A GROUP OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SETTING THEIR RATES TELLING THEM HOW TO DO THEIR JOB. AND THAT IS WHAT THE COURT IN DYNAMAX SAYS IS NOT OKAY THE THAT KIND OF A COMPANY SHOULD BE AN EMPLOYER. NOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS ISSUE OF FLEXIBILITY THAT SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE REYES. FIRST OF ALL THE CALIFORNIA LABOR CODE HAS MANY PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW FLEXIBILITY THERE'S NOTHING A TRADITIONAL EMPLOYMENT THAT PREVENTS FLEXIBILITY WORKERS NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO ADOPT ALTERNATIVE WORK WEEKS WEAVING DAILY OVERTIME. THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO WAIVE READ LUNCH PERIODS WHEN THEY WERE CONSCIOUS OF LESS THAN SIX HOURS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO MAKE UP TIME LEAVE EARLY ONE DAY WORK LATE THE NEXT SO THEY CAN PICK UP THEIR CHILD FROM SCHOOL. THERE IS FLEXIBILITY IN THE LAW I'M FOR EMPLOYEES BUT I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OTHER KINDS OF FLEXIBILITY THAT WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT YET HERE. IF YOU GET INJURED ON THE JOB AS AN EMPLOYEE YOU ARE ENTITLED TO LIGHT DUTY. IF YOU HAVE A SICK CHILD AS AN EMPLOYEE YOU ARE ENTITLED TO TAKE THAT DAY OFF AND STAY HOME WITH YOUR CHILD. IF YOU HAVE AN ILLNESS OR DISABILITY YOU ARE ENTITLED TO REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. THOSE ARE ALL FLEXIBILITY THAT ONLY EXISTS FOR EMPLOYEES. I THOUGHT ABOUT MY OWN LIFE HAVING BEEN AN EMPLOYEE NOW AT THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION FOR ABOUT FIFTEEN YEARS. IN THAT TIME I'VE HAD TWO CHILDREN I WAS FORTUNATE TO HAVE THE FLEXIBILITY TO HAVE MATERNITY LEAVE TO HAVE DISABILITY LEAVE. TO BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT TIME OFF WITH MY KIDS. WHEN MY DAD GOT CANCER I WAS ABLE TO TAKE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE TO SPEND THE LAST MONTHS OF HIS LIFE WITH HIM? THAT'S BECAUSE AS AN EMPLOYEE I HAVE THAT FLEXIBILITY NONE OF THAT IS AVAILABLE TO INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THAT'S WHY THIS ISSUE MATTER SO MUCH THIS IS ABOUT PEOPLE'S LIVES. THIS IS ABOUT YOUR ABILITY TO TAKE CARE TO DO THE THINGS WE ALL BELIEVE WORKERS SHOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO. THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED HUNDREDS OF LAWS WHETHER IT'S PROTECTING IMMIGRANT WORKERS FROM RETALIATION WHETHER IT'S ENSURING EVERY EMPLOYER PROVIDES PAID SICK DAYS OFF WHETHER IT'S PROTECTING WORKERS. FROM ALL KINDS OF DISCRIMINATION. ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS ARE DENIED ONCE WORKERS MISCLASSIFIED. LASTLY I WOULD SAY THE REASON THAT PROTECTING THIS DECISION IS A TOP PRIORITY FOR THE CALIFORNIA LABOR MOVEMENT. IS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ONLY ABOUT THE INDIVIDUAL LIVES OF MILLIONS OF WORKERS IT IS ABOUT WHAT KIND OF ECONOMY WE ARE GOING TO HAVE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE THE GREATEST LEVELS OF INCOME INEQUALITY. EVER SEEN A CONCENTRATION OF WEALTH AT THE TOP DYNAMICS IS ABOUT REBUILDING THE MIDDLE CLASS EXTENDING RIGHTS TO MILLIONS OF WORKERS AND RAISING WAGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF A MISS VEGA -- NEXT OF HIS IDEAS WITH THE BUILDING TRADES DOCUMENTS CHAIR MEMBERS -- CONSTRUCTION UNIONS ORGANIZED IN THE EIGHTEEN HUNDREDS TO PROTECT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS FROM HAZARDOUS AN ABUSE OF WORKING CONDITIONS. A TYPICAL EMPLOYEE WORKS AND MULTIPOINT FOR MULTIPLE EMPLOYERS AND I MULTI EMPLOYER SETTING AND TRAVELS FROM JOB SITE TO JOB SITE. THESE FACTORS MAKE NONUNION CONSTRUCTION WORK AS AN EASY TARGET FOR LABOR CODE VIOLATIONS UNSAFE WORKING CONDITIONS AND MISS CLASSIFICATION. WE BELIEVE THE DYNAMICS RULING PROTECTS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS LAW ABIDING. EMPLOYERS INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTING AN CONSUMERS WHICH INCLUDES PUBLIC ENTITIES. THE GOVERNMENT FUNDS. INFRASTRUCTURE BECAUSE THIS PURPOSE IS TO SUPPORT PROJECTS WITH THE WHITE SOCIAL BENEFIT. INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT IS A CRITICAL TOOL TO INCREASE ECONOMIC GROWTH RAISE AGES FOR WORKERS AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR OUR COMMUNITIES. WE ARE PROUD OF THE PUBLIC INVESTMENT IN ROAD CONSTRUCTION HOUSING WATER PROJECTS IN SCHOOL FACILITIES. BUT THE THREAT OF MISS CLASSIFICATION DIRECTLY UNDERMINES THE QUALITY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE. AND COMMUNITY BENEFITS. IN FACT CALIFORNIA LAW FOR PUBLIC WORKS PROJECTS DEMONSTRATE THAT ALL TYPES OF EMPLOYERS INCLUDING BROKERS CAN ADJUSTING COMPLY WITH WAGE AND HOUR LAWS. IN ORDER TO BE ELIGIBLE TO BID AND WORK ON A PUBLIC WORKS PROJECT ALL CONTRACTORS INCLUDING OWNER OPERATORS AND ONE PERSON SHOPS MUST REGISTER WITH THE I. R.. AND PAY AN ANNUAL FEE OF FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS. OWNER OPERATORS AND ONE PERSON SHOPS MUST ALSO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PREVAILING WAGE AS WELL AS MAINTAIN IT SUBMITS CERTIFIED PAYROLL RECORDS TO THE DR. REGARDLESS IF THEY HAVE COMMON LAW EMPLOYEES. TO BE CLEAR ALL INDIVIDUALS WHO PERFORMED LABOR ON PUBLIC PROJECTS ARE ENTITLED TO THE PREVAILING WAGE. THESE LAWS WERE DESIGNED TO PROTECT WORKERS PROVIDE THE STATE WITH PROPER ENFORCEMENT TOOLS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S PREVAILING WAGE LOSS. READY MIX COMPANIES AND HAULING TRUMP COMPANIES INCLUDING BROKERS MUST ALSO REGISTER AND COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS. THE STATE RECOGNIZED THE POTENTIAL THREAT OF LOW ROAD CONSTRUCTION MODEL SUCH AS MISS CLASSIFICATION AND ACTED TO PROTECT THE STRAITS INVESTMENT MAXIMIZING POTENTIAL FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH. THESE LAWS ALSO PROTECT THE STATE'S APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM WHICH CURRENTLY HAS SIXTY FIVE THOUSAND CONSTRUCTION APPRENTICES. ALSO IMPORTANT TO NOTE. THAT MISTER CLARK MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS AREN'T ABLE TO ENTER THE APPRENTICESHIP SYSTEM SINCE APPRENTICES ARE CONSIDERED EMPLOYEES IN ORDER TO PROTECT THEIR INTERESTS. MS CLASSIFICATION IS A GROWING PROBLEM. RECENTLY THE STATE BROUGHT THE LARGEST WASTE THAT CASE AGAINS RTV CONSTRUCTION A SUBCONTRACTOR FOR CHEATING OVER ONE THOUSAND WORKERS. ALMOST TWELVE MILLION DOLLARS AND BRITTEN VIOLATIONS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE YEARS. IN ANOTHER CASE INVOLVING THIS VERY SAME PROJECTS RTV. ANOTHER THE STATE BROUGHT ANOTHER CASE TOTALING SIX MILLION DOLLARS FOR A LAWSUIT. OVER TWO HUNDRED FORTY NINE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WERE ABUSE ON THAT PROJECT. THAT BLACK CONTRACTORS CALL CALL CALGARY. CALCULUS FOUND TO HAVE MISCLASSIFIED A HUNDRED AND SEVENTY FIVE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THESE WORKERS WERE THREATENED WITH TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT IF THEY RESISTED SIGNING CONTRACT THE FALSELY STATED THERE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS. MANY STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT CONSTRUCTION WORKERS ARE MAYOR BUT SUBJECT TO WAGE THAT THE MISS CLASS ONE RECENT STUDY SHOWED THAT 70% OF WORKERS IN THE LA RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION SECTOR. EXPERIENCE NON PAYMENT OF OVERTIME AND WAIT STAFF. TODAY WASTE AFTER. IN THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY IMPACTS ONE IN SIX WORKERS. AS WE STRUGGLE WITH THE HOUSING CRISIS IT IS IMPORTANT TO SEE A CLEAR PICTURE. ABOUT OUR INDUSTRY. LATINOS DOMINATE THE RESIDENTIAL SECTOR COMPRISING TWO THIRDS OF THE WORK FORCE. YET ONLY MAKE ABOUT SEVENTY CENTS ON THE DOLLAR AS WHITE WORKERS WITH THE SAME SKILLS. AND BECAUSE OF ISSUES SUCH AS MISS CLASSIFICATION THEY ARE SIGNIFICANTLY MORE LIKELY TO BE UNINSURED AND STRUGGLING WITH HOUSING COSTS. THE STATE ESTIMATE THE MISS CLASSIFICATION BECAUSE AND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. APPLYING IN ENFORCING THE A. B. C. TEST WILL IMPROVE THE WORKING CONDITIONS OF THOSE ARE CURRENTLY MISCLASSIFIED SUFFERING FROM WASTE THAT AND OTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF BEING DENIED THE PROTECTIONS OF THE LABOR CODE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OF NEXT TO DOUG BLOCK THE TEAMSTERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PROUD TO BE REPRESENTING OVER TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND TEAMSTERS IN CALIFORNIA TODAY. AND I WANT TO TAKE YOU BACK TO NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR AND A MILESTONE IN AMERICAN LABOR HISTORY. THAT'S WHEN TEAMSTERS GENERAL PRESIDENT JIMMY HOFFA SIGNED THE FIRST NATIONAL MASTER FREIGHT AGREEMENT. UNITING OVER FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND TRUCK DRIVERS UNDER ONE CONTRACT. THE AGREEMENT PROVIDED LIVING WAGES BENEFITS ON THE JOB PROTECTIONS RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR GENERATIONS OF WORKERS. AND THAT'S WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE TODAY. THE CHOICES WE MAKE HERE WILL DETERMINE WHETHER FUTURE GENERATIONS OF WORKERS ENJOY THE SAME. HOUGH UNDERSTOOD THAT IS EMPLOYERS GOT MORE ORGANIZED ON THE NATIONAL LEVEL THE WORKERS NEEDED TO ORGANIZE SO THEY COULD HAVE EQUAL POWER. SO UNDER RELENTLESS PRESSURE FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY IN NINETEEN EIGHTY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT DEREGULATED TRUCKING. AT THAT TIME THE NATIONAL MASTER FREIGHT AGREEMENT COVERED NINETEEN THOUSAND COMPANIES AND UNIONIZED. IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS ALMOST SEVEN THOUSAND COMPANIES WENT BANKRUPT. WITHIN TEN YEARS NEARLY FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND TEAMSTERS LOST THEIR JOBS. TODAY WE ONLY HAVE THREE COMPANIES AND FORTY FIVE THOUSAND WORKERS LEFT UNDER NATIONAL FREIGHT AGREEMENTS. SO WHAT HAPPENED. TWO WORDS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING. OUT OF THE ASHES OF DEREGULATION THIS BUSINESS MODEL CAME TO DOMINATE TRACKING LEADING TO A REDUCTION IN WORKER POWER WAGES IN THE DECLINE OF A ONCE MIDDLE CLASS OCCUPATION. DEREGULATION HAS BEEN WILDLY SUCCESSFUL FOR BIG BUSINESS ALLOWING LARGE COMPANIES TO PAY MUCH LESS TO MOVE GOODS. THOSE COST SAVINGS HAVE COME FROM A RACE TO THE BOTTOM AS COMPANIES CUT WAGES ALMOST 50% SINCE DEREGULATION. NOW DRIVING A TRUCK FOR MOST HAS BEEN DESCRIBED AS A SWEATSHOP ON WHEELS DRIVERS WORK SIXTY TO A HUNDRED HOURS PER WEEK MAKE LESS THAN MINIMUM WAGE AFTER EXPENSES HAVE NO WORKERS COMP AND NO BENEFITS. SHIFTED THE COST OF BUYING OPERATING AND MAINTAINING TRUCKS ON TO THE BACKS OF THOSE LEAST EQUIPPED TO DO IT. AND THIS COMPROMISES OUR ABILITY TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS IS DRIVERS CAN NOT AFFORD TO BUY CLEAN TRUCKS. COURSE THEY HAVE LITTLE RECOURSE TO DO ANYTHING UNDER LIES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS BECAUSE THEY CANNOT ORGANIZE A UNION. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT CALIFORNIA HAS DONE MORE TO ADDRESS MISS CLASSIFICATION IN TRUCKING THAN ANY STATE. AND SINCE TWENTY ELEVEN PORT TRUCK DRIVERS HAVE FILED AT LEAST A THOUSAND CLAIMS WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER. ALMOST HALF OF THOSE OF LEAD THE DETERMINATIONS THE DRIVERS WERE IN FACT EMPLOYEES. AND THEREFORE OWED OVER FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN STOLEN WAGES AND PENALTIES. THE DYNAMICS RULINGS AGAINST A PACKAGE DELIVERY COMPANY THAT COMPETES DIRECTLY WITH OUR LARGEST EMPLOYER UPS. AT UPS A WORKER WITH A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION EVEN IF THEY HAVE A CRIMINAL BACKGROUND CAN MAKE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FULLY PAID FAMILY HEALTH INSURANCE AND RETIRE WITH A PENSION. UPS POSTED A BILLION DOLLAR PROFIT LAST YEAR SHOWING THAT A COMPANY CAN MAKE MONEY AND TREAT THEIR WORKERS RIGHT. YOU PS ANOTHER GOOD EMPLOYERS SHOULD NOT BE UNDERMINED BY THE CHOICES THIS BODY MAKES. MISS CLASSIFICATION IS AN ATTEMPT TO WEAKEN THE BARGAINING POWER OF WORKERS. UNCHECKED WILL CONTRIBUTE TO EVER WIDENING INCOME INEQUALITY AND INCREASED CORPORATE POWER. THEREFORE WE URGE YOU TO PROTECT AND EXPAND THIS DYNAMICS RULING. AND IN DOING SO TO HELP PROTECT AND REBUILD THE STATE'S MIDDLE CLASS THANK YOU. ALL GOOD REALLY GOOD ON TIME. THEY'RE PHONE -- CUT IT AND AND FINALLY -- DAVE WHERE THE SEIU UNITED SERVICE WERE CHRISTMAS. MORNING I'M SURE. I PROBABLY REPRESENT FIFTY THOUSAND WORKERS IN THE PRIVATE AND PRIVATE SECTOR AND IN SERVICE INDUSTRY AS GENDER SECURITY OFFICERS IN PASSENGER SERVICE WORKERS. WATER PORTS IN CALIFORNIA. EVERY WORKER DESERVES BASIC ECONOMIC SECURITY INCLUDING PROTECTIONS LIKE MINIMUM WAGE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE A WORKPLACE FREE OF DISCRIMINATION HARASSMENT. AND COMPENSATION IF AN INTEGER IN INJURY ON THE JOB THE KERRS. HOWEVER MORE AND MORE COMPANIES AS YOU HAVE HEARD ARE CUTTING CORNERS ON COST BUT YOU CAN THE WORKERS. LIKE DRIVERS JANITORS CONSTRUCTION WORKERS HELP TECHNICIANS OUT OF THESE BASIC PROTECTIONS INCREASE THE BOTTOM LINE AT THE CASA WORKERS AN UNFAIR BUSINESS COMPETITION. WHEN WORKING PEOPLE ARE TRAPPED IN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR STATUS INSTEAD OF RECOGNIZE EMPLOYEES THEY HAVE NO ABILITY FOR WORK RECOURSE TO STAND UP AND DEFEND DEFEND THEMSELVES AND THEIR COWORKERS? WHEN WAGES ARE STOLEN FROM THEM OR WORKERS GET HURT ON THE JOB? MISS CLASSIFICATION OF WORKERS IT INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR FOR THE TILT THE BALANCE OF POWER TO EMPLOYERS AND AWAY FROM WORKERS. GENERAL COMPANIES FRICKLEY MISCLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO THEY CAN AVOID BASIC MINIMUM STANDARDS ON WAGES AND SOCIAL SAFETY NET PAYMENTS. NOT ONLY DOES THIS HARM THE MISCLASSIFIED WORKERS IT CREATES A DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON THE GENERAL INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE WE WORK WITH MANY EMPLOYERS ARE RESPONSIBLE IN THEIR BEHAVIOR AS EMPLOYERS TO THE EMPLOYEES. THE PAY HOURLY WAGES WORKERS COMP AND ADDITIONAL BENEFITS AND ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE TREATED WITH THE DIGNITY DIGNITY AND RESPECT THEY DESERVE. BUT THE SAD TRUTH IS THAT THIS THAT THESE SECTORS OF THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY WHERE THEY ARE NOT PROTECTED BY THE UNION. IN THOSE AREAS OF CALIFORNIA THEY HAVE HAD TO COMPETE FOR BUSINESS WITH GENERAL COMPANIES THAT CAN PROVIDE SERVICES FOR FAR LESS BY MISCLASSIFIED IN THE WORKERS. AND IN THE END XCELERATED THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM. MISS CLASSIFICATION IS RAMPANT IN THE GENERAL INDUSTRY COMPANIES ARE CLEANING OR CHEATING WORKERS OUT OF THEIR BASIC WORKS WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS. THE PRACTICE VARIES FROM COMPANIES THAT PROVIDE GENDERS WITH LEGALLY COMPLEX CONTRACTOR GRANT CONTRACT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENTS TO COMPANIES THAT HIRE JAGGER WITHOUT EVER DISCUSSION THE CLASSIFICATION. BUT AT THE END OF THE YEAR PROVIDE THE WORK WITH THE TEN NINETY NINE MOST OFTEN GENDERS ARE NOT GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY NEGOTIATE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT. THEY ARE TOLD THAT IF THEY WANT TO WORK FOR THE COMPANY THEY HAVE TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. THEY ARE MADE TO SIGN AGREEMENT IN ENGLISH WITH COMPLEX LEGAL JARGON THAT ESSENTIALLY GIVE THE COMPANY SUBSTANTIAL CONTROL OVER THE WORKING CONDITIONS. BECAUSE MOST OF THESE MOST OF THEM. BECAUSE MOST OF THEM. MOST OF THEM MOST OFTEN ARE IMMIGRANTS SPANISH SPEAKING WOMEN EXPLOITED BY THE CAUGHT BECAUSE OF THEIR STATUS THEIR GENDER AND LANGUAGE. IN ALL HONESTY THE CONDUCT OF MANY OF THESE COMPANIES IS CRIMINAL BECAUSE HE KNOWINGLY EXPLOIT THOSE WHO ARE LESS LIKELY TO DEFEND THEMSELVES. FOR EXAMPLE IT WORK IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY WORK CLEANING A JAM AND WAS CLASSIFIED AS AN EMPLOYEE. THE COMPANY LOST THE CONTRACTOR WHEN YOU COMPANY TOOK OVER THE CONTRACT SHE WAS TOLD THAT SHE WOULD BE PAID WITH THE TEN NINETY NINE SHE QUESTION WHY SHOULD BE PAID WITH THE TEN NINETY NINE IF FOR WORK DID NOT CHANGE. CHOOSE DOING USED TO BE PAID WITH THE TEN NINETY NINE AND SHE WAS TERMINATED. RIGHT HERE IN SACRAMENTO WE'RE DEALING WITH THE SITUATION WERE JENNER'S WERE WORKING FOR A LAW ABIDING UNIONIZED GENTLE COMPANY LOS WORK TO ANOTHER COMPANY. THE NEW COMPANY WAS ABLE TO CLEAN FOR FAR LESS BY MISS CLASSIFYING THE WORKERS. MISS CLASSIFICATION IS NOT ONLY IMPACT WORKERS IT'S ALSO A LOSS TO THE STATE IN THE REVENUE IN REVENUE FROM PAYROLL TAXES INSURANCE PREMIUMS. AND UNINSURED WORK ACCIDENTS AND WAGE THEFT FOR LAW ABIDING EMPLOYERS MISS CLASSIFICATION CAN GIVE THEIR UNSCRUPULOUS COMPETITOR UPWARDS TO A 40% ADVANTAGE. THIS IS A DANGEROUS RACE TO THE BOTTOM WHERE'S BURKE IS NOT ONLY LOSE OUT ON BASIC RESPECT WORKPLACE PROTECTIONS BUT NOW THEY'RE ALSO -- BUSINESSES THEY NEVER INITIATED OR CONTROLLED. IT'S A LEGAL FICTION THAT THEY ARE CONTRACTORS IF YOU LOOK. AT THE WORKING CONDITIONS. DYNAMICS PROVIDES CLARITY AND SIMPLICITY THE ISSUE OF WHO IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. THE PROTEST WAS CONFUSING IT REQUIRED A BALANCE OF SEVERAL FACTORS THAT OFTEN LEAD TO INCONSISTENT RESULTS OF WHO WAS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. AT THE END OF IT ALL. YOU LOST ME AT THE OTHER WHAT EVERY AT THE END OF IT ALL EVERYONE LOSES TO WORKERS I'M IS CLASSIFIED LAW ABIDING COMPANIES ARE UNABLE TO COMPETE. WORKERS ARE CHEATED OUT OF THEIR WAGES THAT WORK THAT THEY WORK FOR AND REVENUES LOST BY THE STATE THAT GOES FOR THE SOCIAL PROGRAM FOR OUR RESIDENTS. IF I HAD THE ABILITY TO ROLL BACK THE CLOCK. THEN MAYBE WE WOULD NOT HAVE HAVE TO SPEND THE LAST THIRTY PLUS YEARS TRYING TO REBUILD AN INDUSTRY FOR WORKERS A LOST EVERYTHING BECAUSE THE INTRODUCTION OF SUBCONTRACTING A MASS SCALE THE NINETEEN EIGHTIES. TODAY THE SINGLE GREATEST THREAT TO WORKING PEOPLE'S ABUSE OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTING. THIS NOT WAIT ANOTHER ANOTHER FORTY YEARS RESTORE WHAT WORKERS ARE LOSING NOW IN REAL TIME. IN CLOSING WITH AB. FIVE CALIFORNIA BECAUSE OF A CLEAR CHOICE IN FRONT OF THEM YOU COULD DECIDE TO LISTEN TO UNSCRUPULOUS EMPLOYERS. AND CORPORATE GIANTS THE PROFIT OF THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR SCREAM OR WE CAN LISTEN TO WORKERS EXPERIENCES DIRECTLY AND GIVE THEM THE RESPECT. THERE BURKE DESERVES THE WAGES THEIR LEGALLY ENTITLED TO AND THE BENEFITS AND RIGHTS THEY ARE DUE THANK YOU THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH -- AND JUST CLARIFY WE'RE NOT DISCUSSING AT THIS HEARING ANY PARTICULAR BILL BUT I DO HAVE A A QUESTION ANY OF YOU CAN ANSWER THIS. SO IS A COMMON PRACTICE THAT WORKERS SUBJECT TO MISS CLASSIFICATION ALL SET TO SIGN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS AND AND HOW DOES THAT. AFFECT YOUR ABILITY TO BRING A MISS CLASSIFICATIONS IT. THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION I WOULD SAY THAT AT THIS POINT WE KNOW 70% OF CALIFORNIA WORKPLACES REQUIRE WORKERS TO SIGN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS UPON HIRE. UNDIES ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS ARE PARTICULARLY COMMON. IN TWO AREAS ONE IS LOW WAGE WORK PARTICULARLY RESTAURANTS. AND FAST FOOD. RESTAURANTS IN PARTICULAR I'M IN FACT OFTEN REQUIRE IT IN THE APPLICATION TO WORK THERE IN ADDITION -- MANY COMPANIES IN THE GIG ECONOMY REQUIRE WORKERS TO SIGN ARBITRATION AGREEMENTS RIGHT WHEN THEY SIGN UP THAT MEANS ANY -- CLAIM THAT A WORKER WANTS TO BRING OVER HAVING BEEN MISCLASSIFIED ONLY GOES TO THE EMPLOYERS. PRIVATE ARBITRATOR ANKIT THEY CANNOT GO EITHER TO COURT OR TO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO HAVE THEIR CLAIM RESOLVED. AND MS REGARDLESS OF YOUR ORGANIZATION REPRESENTS. UNIONS ACROSS IN A NUMBER DIFFERENT SECTORS AND CAL BY THESE UNIONS HAVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND THE BENEFITS AND WAGES ARE FAR BEYOND YOU KNOW BUT PRAYED TALK ABOUT HERE IN TERMS A BARE MINIMUM. SO WHY YOU KNOW WHY IS THIS CASE OR THE RAMIFICATIONS OF WHAT COULD HAPPEN GOING FORWARD RELEVANT. DO YOU AND THE MEMBERSHIP YOU REPRESENT. THANK YOU. OFTENTIMES I DO HAVE TO EXPLAIN TO LEGISLATORS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE WORK THAT WE THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION A DOES HERE IN THE CAPITAL IS NOT ON BEHALF OF OUR OWN MEMBERS ARE MEMBERS ARE NOT MISCLASSIFIED OUR MEMBERS ARE IN UNIONS. I'M AND PROTECTED BY THEIR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS BUT WE SPEND MOST OF OUR TIME ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF THE NON UNION WORKERS WHO DO NOT HAVE ANY OF THOSE KINDS OF PROTECTIONS. ABSOLUTELY THERE ARE IMPACTS ON OUR MEMBERS ARE MEMBERS EMPLOYERS ARE HARMED WHEN YOU HAVE THESE A LOW ROAD EMPLOYERS KIND OF CHEATING A LOT IT TAKE TO GET CONTRACTS -- BUT MORE MORE BASICALLY WE BELIEVE EVERY WORKER DESERVES BASIC RIGHTS WHETHER OR NOT THERE ARE ANY UNION AND I WOULD SAY NOT THAT'S NOT ONLY THE CASE. FOR US AS THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION NATIONWIDE I THINK THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST PRESSING ISSUES FOR THE LABOR MOVEMENT EVERY STATE IN THE COUNTRY YOU HAVE UNIONS GRAPPLING WITH. HOW DO WE REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS HOW DO WE TAKE ON OF THE GROWTH IN SUBCONTRACTED WORK IN IN IN THE USE OF INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN COMPANIES REALLY TRYING TO SAY? I DON'T WANT TO HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK OF MY COMPANY THAT'S THE TREND THAT WE'VE SEEN FOR THE LAST FEW DECADES AND I THINK AS A LABOR MOVEMENT THAT IS THE NUMBER ONE MOST IMPORTANT THING FOR US TO ADDRESS [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] ANY. DECEMBER IS ALSO TO QUESTIONS ONE JUST A FOLLOW UP AND IT IT'S TRUE RIGHT THAT IF WITHOUT BEING EMPLOYEES A WORKER HAS NO RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BILL AND POWER THEMSELVES HAVE A VOICE ON THE JOB. THAT'S RIGHT SO I MEAN I DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO SUGGEST THAT WE DON'T WANT MORE UNION MEMBERS WE ABSOLUTELY DO AND I I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE WE THOSE OF US WHO HAVE COME FROM ORGANIZED LABOR KNOWS. IF YOU DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT PLACE THAN HAVE A UNION CONTRACT BECAUSE THEN YOU WON'T NEED THEM TO BE -- IF YOU DON'T WANT LAWSUITS THERE'S A WHOLE BUNCH OF THINGS THAT THAT WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE EMPLOYER BUT I I WANT TO BE VERY TRANSPARENT. I I ABSOLUTELY THINK ONE OF THE REASONS I I IN LIKE DYNAMAX IN LIKE THREE CLASSIFICATION OF EMPLOYEES CORRECTLY IS THAT THEY HAVE THAT FUNDAMENTAL FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHT TO ORGANIZE -- IN THE WORKPLACE. WELL IN FACT I DON'T THINK ANYBODY SAID THAT. THE EIGHTEEN NINETY SHERMAN ANTI TRUST ACT WAS ESTABLISHED TO PREVENT CORPORATE MONOPOLIES. AND THOSE ARE THE SAME LAWS THAT ARE USED WHEN IMMIGRANT WORKERS WHO ARE MISCLASSIFIED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TRY TO COME TOGETHER. TO DO SOMETHING TO IMPROVE THEIR ECONOMIC LOT IN LIFE. SO IT IS A PERVERSE INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IN MY OPINION. THANK YOU AND THEN I HAVE ONE ADDITIONAL QUESTION AND YOU MAY NOT HAVE THE ANSWER TO FIND IT I JUST REALIZED AS YOU WERE SPEAKING -- ALL OF YOU ESPECIALLY IN CONSTRUCTION AND JANITORIAL DO WE KNOW OF I GUESS THE THE I GUESS IT WOULD HAVE TO BE LABOR COMMISSIONER NUMBERS OF OF FOUND MISS CLASSIFICATIONS HOW THE PERCENTAGE OF THOSE THAT IT HAPPENED BE LATINO WORKERS. I CAN SAY THE JANITORIAL INDUSTRY IT'S ALL AT THE NO WORKERS AND PREDOMINATELY WOMEN ON BECAUSE THE GENERAL INDUSTRY IS ABOUT 6265%. WOMEN EMPLOYED. AND SO YOU KNOW THE VICTIMS ARE USUALLY SPANISH SPEAKING IMMIGRANTS WITH. STATUS QUESTIONS AND THEN AS FOR IS THAT CONSTANT CHURN WILL SAY TO THE RACE TO THE BOTTOM AND EXPLOITATION AROUND THAT AROUND THOSE VULNERABILITIES AND EVEN IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY IT'S A GROWING -- PERCENTAGE OF IT'S WORKERS YOU GO DOWN TO THE PORTS IT'S THE UNITED NATIONS DOWN THERE IMMIGRANTS FROM EVERY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD. FOR CONSTRUCTION AND MOST OF OUR PREMISES ARE LATINOS AND IN RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION ALSO MOST OF THE CONSTRUCTION WORKS ON THE THING IS A SMALL. VICE CHAIR. FOR WELL GOOD MORNING AND IT'S IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE CARE THINGS WERE PUT THIS ON AND THERE'S BEEN A LOT DISCUSSED TODAY AND ACTUALLY THROUGH THE LAST WITNESS FOR FIVE MONTHS ON THIS -- ISSUE AND EVEN GOING INTO LAST YEAR AND I THINK WE'RE ACTUALLY MAKING A TREMENDOUS PROGRESS I APPLAUD EVERYBODY'S EFFORTS BOTH LABOR BUSINESS MEETING COMING TOGETHER. TO TO WORK ON THIS -- ISSUE BECAUSE I DO THINK IT'S FUNDAMENTAL TO THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA THAT WE GET THIS FIXED AND GET IT FIXED PROPERLY AND SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT THE WORK THAT'S BEING PUT IN. I DO -- HAVE A FEW -- CONCERNS -- WITH THIS AND HAS. MORE DO WITH THE SMALL GUY. MORE TO DO WITH IT THE THE INDIVIDUALS -- FROM MY COMMUNITY. A LOT OF THE GROUPS WE TALK ABOUT WHETHER IT'S RICK REAL ESTATE AGENTS OR INSURANCE OR ER DOCTORS THEY HAVE THE ABILITY TO TO WORK ON THIS TO FIX IT. TO PROTECT THEIR INDUSTRIES AS I THINK THEY SHOULD AND I'M EXCITED ABOUT THAT. BUT IT WHAT DO WE DO WITH THE THE SMALL INDIVIDUALS -- THE GYM OWNERS THE PLOT IS STUDIOS THAT GROUP OF PEOPLE WHICH I KNOW WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT. BUT I AM CONCERNED THAT THAT WILL WE FORGET ABOUT THEM. WE FORGET ABOUT THEM IN THE SENSE THAT ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY GET SUCKED INTO A DECISION -- THAT'S WE CODIFY HERE THE LEGISLATURE BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND THEN THEY GET STUCK WITH US. AND SO I GUESS -- IS THERE A WAY THAT IF SOMEBODY TRULY WANTED TO BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR WHETHER IT'S A A PERSONAL TRAINER AT THE GYM YOU KNOW THAT'S RENTING SPACE AND THEN YOU KNOW THEY CONTROL OUR OWN HOURS AND ALL OF THOSE THINGS. IS VERY. THAT A SYSTEM A WAY THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO THE TO THE LABOR MOVEMENT IF THEY TRULY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACT AND I HEARD YOU KNOW LANGUAGE BARRIERS WITH AND CONTRACTS AND SHE'S BACK THAT'S UNACCEPTABLE WE WE NEED TO FIX THAT. SO I MEAN SERVICE THE ET DE THAT WOULD BE THE ADMINISTRATOR OF THIS I JUST WOULD LIKE YOUR THOUGHTS ON IS THERE A PATHWAY FORWARD FOR THE SMALL GUYS THAT TRULY WANT TO BE INDEPENDENT AND ARE EDUCATED ON WHAT EXACTLY THAT MEANS. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION MISTER FLORA -- I'VE WORKED ON THIS ISSUE OF MISS CLASSIFICATION EVERY YEAR IN ALL THE YEARS THAT I'VE BEEN HERE AT THE LABOR FEDERATION AND SO -- A FEW YEARS AGO I GOT A CALL FROM A WOMAN NAMED PAT WHO TOLD ME THAT SHE OWNED A SMALL PACKAGE DELIVERY COMPANY IN LOS ANGELES. AND SHE STARTED TALKING TO ME ABOUT THE COMPETITION THAT SHE FACED FROM A LOT OF THE BIG CORPORATIONS THAT MISCLASSIFIED AND SHE WOULD SAY TO ME I TRY TO DO RIGHT BY MY EMPLOYEES I'M A SMALL EMPLOYER. I TREAT THEM WELL WE'RE A FAMILY I TAKE CARE AND LOOK OUT FOR THEM AND YET I LOSE CONTRACTS TO THESE GUYS WHO ARE CHEATING AND BREAKING THE RULES AND SHE WOULD SHE WOULD CHECK IN ON ME EVERY COUPLE MONTHS FOR MANY YEARS I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED TARA. STOPPED HEARING FROM HER SHE'S TO CALL ALL THE TIME AND SAY WHAT ARE YOU DOING ON THIS WHY AREN'T YOU YOU KNOW DOING MORE GET US MORE FUNDING GET US I'M STRONGER LAWS. I REALLY BELIEVE FAIR COMPETITION IS THE KEY FOR SMALL EMPLOYERS YOU HAVE TO HAVE CLEAR RULES THAT CAN BE EASILY ENFORCED OTHERWISE THE BIG COMPANIES ARE ALWAYS GONNA FIGURE OUT THEY'RE GONNA HAVE HR PROFESSIONALS AND LAWYERS AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXPLOIT THE LOOPHOLES AND THE LITTLE GUYS ARE GONNA GET SCREWED AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE ONES THAT LOSE CONTRACTS AND LOSE OPPORTUNITIES. SO I WOULD START WITH SAYING I CAN -- IS IS INCREDIBLY BENEFICIAL TO SMALL EMPLOYERS. I'M HAPPY TO TALK MORE ABOUT SOME OF THE THE CONVERSATIONS I THINK MAYBE OUTSIDE THE HEARING ABOUT KIND OF YOUR SPECIFIC QUESTION BECAUSE I THINK. THE HEARINGS COMBINED TO THIS COOPER DYNAMAX RATHER THAN ONGOING DISCUSSIONS KNOWN THAT'S BEEN APPRECIATE THAT BECAUSE IT. WHEN WE GO TO OUR CHAMBERS AND WE TALK AND AND IT'S PRIMARILY BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU -- LARGE CORPORATIONS WE CAN FIGURE THIS OUT RIGHT I MEAN THEY THEY'VE GOT. LEGIONS OF PEOPLE TOO TOUGH TO WORK ON THIS. IT IS THAT SMALL GROUP THE CHAMBER MEMBERS THAT I AM ACTUALLY VERY VERY CONCERNED ABOUT AND SO LET'S CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND AND APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. I THINK YOU. KNOW THE MEMBERS. OKAY WELL THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH REALLY APPRECIATE IT -- AND IN ALL OF AS WAS INDICATED BY NUMBER OF US UP HERE THESE ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS I THINK PRETTY MUCH EVERY PANELIST. HAS INDICATED THAT AS WELL AND SO -- WE APPRECIATE THE EXPERTISE AND THE PERSPECTIVE OF FROM THAT THE EMPLOYEES SIDE THANK YOU ALL FOR HIM SURE. NOW THERE -- THE NEXT PORTION IS PUBLIC COMMENT -- THERE ARE QUITE A FEW PEOPLE WHO COULD BE OUTSIDE THIS ROOM. THAT WOULD LIKE TO MAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AND MENTION HAVE A VERY HARD STOP -- BECAUSE WE HAVE TO GO TO OUR REGULARLY SCHEDULED A CAUCUS LUNCHEON AND LUNCHES AND SUCH -- MEETINGS -- AND SO WHAT I'M GONNA DO IS I'M GONNA ASK EACH PERSON I HOPE PEOPLE OUTSIDE HEARING AS WELL -- EACH PERSON WILL HAVE THIRTY SECONDS TO IDENTIFY WHO THEY ARE AND AND GIVE -- THEIR PERSPECTIVE AGAIN THIS IS NOT THE FIRST OR LAST TIME YOU HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HEARD. BUT I THINK THAT IDENTIFYING YOURSELF WHO YOU'RE WITH IF YOU ARE WITH THE PARTICULAR ORGANIZATION IF YOU'RE NOT. JUST IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND IF YOU WANT TO EXPRESS A PERSONAL PARTICULAR POINT OF PERSPECTIVE. CERTAINLY FEEL FREE TO DO THAT IF YOU HAVE A PARTICULAR QUESTION THAT YOU WANT US. TO TRY TO ENGAGE WITH IN THE IN THE DAYS AND WEEKS AHEAD CERTAINLY ASK THAT QUESTION BUT I APOLOGIZE BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO BE HEARD. THAT WE'LL JUST HAVE THESE THIRTY SECOND KIND OF LIKE -- BY A GENEROUS ME TO WHERE YOU CAN [inaudible] AND SIR -- TO ON ON YOUR THOUGHTS SO -- BOBBY -- LÃ  HAD. OUR RUNNERS MARCOS OVER AND I HAVE MY BROTHER HERE CHRISTOPHER SO BUT WAS WITH US OF A SON'S TRANSPORT. AND TO TALK ON THE SUBJECT REAL QUICK -- MISTER FLORA AND AS TO WHAT HAPPENS TO THE SMALL INDIVIDUAL WE ARE A SMALL TRUCKING COMPANY INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- WE LISTEN TO THREE PANELS EARLIER TODAY AND I THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE NEED TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE AWAY FROM THIS IS HOW IT'S AFFECTING US DIRECTLY AND HOW AIDS -- EIGHT PLAYS INTO OUR DAY TO DAY WE HEARD FROM -- THE FIRST PANEL THAT 30% OF WORKERS ARE MISCLASSIFIED HOWEVER OF THOSE 30% HOW MANY WERE ACTUALLY SPOKEN -- TO IN ORDER TO FIGURE OUT WHETHER OR NOT THEY WANTED TO GO AHEAD AND GO FORTH WITH BEING THIS CLASSIFIED OR ACTUALLY BE AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR. WE BOTH WENT TO SCHOOL WE BOTH FINISHED UNIVERSITY IT IS OUR CHOICE TO BE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS -- AS FAR AS SAFETY ON THE JOB AND EVERY PROJECT THAT WERE ON YOU KNOW WE THIS BROTHER TO A WORK RELATED INJURY. AND SO FOR US IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THE FLEXIBILITY OF BEING AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR ALLOWS US TO GO TO ON WHICHEVER JOB ON LEAVE WHICHEVER JOB WE WANT TO GO AHEAD AND TAKE. RIGHT NOW THE BIGGEST THE PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN SERVING ON ARE THESE NORTH BAY FOR A DONE THE FIRES UP NORTH. RESPONDED TO THE FIRES IN CINEMA COUNTY RESPONDED TO THE FIRES IN READING AND WE ARE RIGHT NOW LIVING IN CHICO HELPING OUT WITH THE FIRE DEBRIS CLEANUP IN PARADISE.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. GOOD MORNING JOANNE BUT IN COURT REPRESENTING THE SECURITIES INDUSTRY AND FINANCIAL MARKETS ASSOCIATION. MOST CONCERNED WITH THE THE AND IT AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE DYNAMICS DECISION. ON THE INTERNET IMPACT IT'S GIVING. ANY CONTRACTOR MODEL HAS AN OPTION IN OUR INDUSTRY FOR OVER SEVENTY FIVE YEARS. JUST LIKE THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY. THE BROKER DEALERS ANY INFECTION -- HIGHLY EDUCATED. REGULATED BY THE FCC FAN RIGHT AND STATE SECURITIES REGULATORS -- THEY WANT TO OWN THEIR OWN BUSINESS THEY PAY FOR THEIR OWN STAFF -- INDEPENDENT BROKER DEALERS AND THEIR AFFILIATED INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL ADVISERS ARE NOT WHAT DYNAMAX IS ABOUT -- IF THEY ARE NOT EXCLUDED FROM THE DECISION THEY WILL FACE SIGNIFICANT HURDLES OF TRYING TO SATISFY THE A. B. C. TEST THANK YOU THANK YOU. I GOOD MORNING SEAN WAS THE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF INDEPENDENT BUSINESS REPRESENTING ABOUT TWENTY THOUSAND SMALL INDEPENDENT BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE STATE WE'RE FEELING DEEP ANXIETY AND UNCERTAINTY AS A RESULT OF THE DYNAMICS A. B. C. TESTS WERE CURRENTLY FACED WITH. WHO NOT ONLY UTILIZE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS IN A LOT OF THE BUSINESS MODELS BUT ALSO MANY OF OUR MEMBERS WHO ARE SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS? AND SELF EMPLOYED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS THEMSELVES I CAN TELL YOU JUST THIS MORNING HAVE RECEIVED ANOTHER THIRTY MESSAGES REMEMBERS ACROSS THE STATE WHO CAN'T BE HERE A LOT OF EXAMPLES BUT THE UNIFYING POINT IS IT'S ON WORKABLE CURRENTLY WOULD LIKE TO SEE. A FIX FROM THE LEGISLATURE THANK YOU SIR THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING I'M NORI JAVA AND I'M REPRESENTING THE LANGUAGE SERVICES INDUSTRY AND CONFERENCE INTERPRETING IN PARTICULAR WE ARE VERY CONCERNED WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ITS VALUE WITH THE DYNAMAX DECISION FOR WORKERS. BUT OUR INDUSTRY IS GOING TO BE DECIMATED BY THIS BECAUSE WE ARE AN INDUSTRY THAT PROVIDES INTERPRETING SERVICES FOR CONFERENCES AND EVENTS ALL OVER THE WORLD INCLUDING THE HANOI SUMMIT GOING ON RIGHT NOW. THAT INTERPRETER IS AN INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR THEY'RE ONE OF OUR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS AND THE STATE DEPARTMENT FOR BIDS THEM TO BE EMPLOYEES FOR CONFLICT OF INTEREST THREE CENTS. SO PLEASE PUT IT ON YOUR RADAR OUR BUSINESS IS FORTY YEARS OLD WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU. THANK YOU. HI MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS -- I'M JACK FROST AND THE PRESIDENT OF PRO SMALL BIZ CALIFORNIA. A REPRESENT A LOT OF THOSE SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE CHAMBER MEMBERS THAT THE VICE CHAIR REFERENCED EARLIER. I'M SURE YOU'RE AWARE THAT WERE ENJOYING ONE OF THE STRONGEST ECONOMY. ECONOMIES IN OUR HISTORY IN OUR LIFETIME. AND YET SMALL BUSINESSES ARE LEAVING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL. EVER RECORDED. THE DYNAMICS DECISION. COULD IMPACT OVER TWO MILLION ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT COULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS IT'S NOT GOING IN A GOOD DIRECTION. ANOTHER THING I NOTICED THIS MORNING. WAS THAT THERE WERE THREE PANELS. AND ON THE THREE PANELS WE HAD ABOUT FORTY SIX MINUTES DEVOTED TO THOSE THAT ARE IN FAVOR OF THE DYNAMICS DECISION. NOW ONLY ABOUT SIXTY MINUTES DEVOTED TO THOSE THAT ARE AGAINST. THE DYNAMICS DECISION I DON'T THINK THIS SEEMS TO ME. LIKE A FAIR AND BALANCED APPROACH AND I HOPE IT'S FUTURE. COMMITTEE MEETINGS WILL BE MORE BALANCED TO BOTH SIDES OF THE OF THE VIEWPOINT THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTER CHAIRMAN WAS CHRISTMAS KAYLEE ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION CANTIERE CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION -- I THINK THAT THE THE LEGISLATIVE BRANCH SHOULD MAKE A DETERMINATION WHEN WE HAVE SUCH A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE LABOR AND EMPLOYMENT LAWS. ARE WHERE YOU CAN CONSIDER ALL THE FACTORS AND THE BROAD AND SIGNIFICANT SWEEP OF SUCH A DECISION RATHER THAN JUST PARTIES TO THE LITIGATION. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER YOU AGREE WITH DYNAMICS HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE DRESSES THE SIGNIFICANT ISSUE OF RETROACTIVITY VERSUS PROSPECTIVE APPLICATION. OF THIS DECISION AND LASTLY IN OUR COMPARISON LOOKING AT OTHER STATES. I'M NOT AWARE OF A SINGLE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THE PRIVATE ATTORNEY GENERAL LACK PAGA TO DEAL WITH. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING ERR BLACK ON A MAP OF THE WESTERN STATES TRUCKING ASSOCIATION -- WSJ REPRESENTS ABOUT -- THOUSAND COULD A TRUCKING COMPANIES -- PRIMARILY TO THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY ABOUT 45% OF THESE ARE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR OWN ROBBER'S EACH OF WHICH IS REQUIRED TO HAVE A ITS OWN INDEPENDENT MOTOR CARRIER PERMANENT. AND REQUIRE -- IN PRODUCES ON TRUCK DOING OR TO GO AND BUSINESS I'M FORTUNATE TO BE PRONG OF THE A. B. C. TEST WHICH MAKES SAID -- VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE FOR A TRIP ONE TRUCKING COMPANY TO CONTRACT WITH AN OWNER OPERATOR. THAT'S WHAT YOU SEEN THE EFFECT IS THAT PEOPLE ARE JUST REFUSING TO CONTACT WITH THE OWNER OPERATORS IN GENERAL THAT'S WE URGE LEGISLATURE -- TO DEVELOP LEGISLATION TO PROVIDE CLARITY AND NOW PROVIDES ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS. FOR WORKERS IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU CAN YOU CLARIFY ONE THING I'M SORRY. SO YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT COMPANIES WHO HAVE EMPLOYEE IS THERE A BALANCE ON THAT LIKE IF IF YOU AND YOUR COMPANY -- AND I HATE TO GO DOWN THE TERM JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS THOUGHT -- LIKE I KNOW WITH CONSTRUCTION THERE'S LIKE CORPS WORKERS VERSES THOSE THAT BROUGHT IN IS THERE A PERCENTAGE YOU HAVE. IS YOUR YOUR WORKFORCE ONE PERSON THAT'S ACTUALLY THE OWNER TO PEOPLE THE GUY THAT DOES THE BOOKS AND AND THE OWNER THREE PEOPLE THE WOMAN WHO ANSWERED THE PHONE THE GUY THAT DOES THE BOOKS. AND THEN YOU'RE CONTRACTING OUT ALL BUT YOU ARE YOU HAVE THIS. WE ALWAYS HERE MODELS ALL OVER THE PLACE BUT YEAH I OFTENTIMES THE MODEL IS YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES AND WHEN THERE'S AN OVERFLOW NECESSARY ARGUE THERE'S MORE WORK NEEDED. THE CONTRACT OUT WITH ADDITIONAL OWNER OPERATORS TO CITY THINK -- I'M I'M JUST CURIOUS AS A POSSIBLE APPROACH TO NOT DESTROY THIS ENTIRE BUSINESS IS THAT COMPANIES THAT DIRECTLY HIRE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TRUCKERS DURING TIMES OF FLUX COULD. CONTRACT WITH INDIVIDUAL OWNER OPERATORS -- I WAS CERTAINLY HAPPY TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS I'M I I'M JUST KIND OF I'M I'M CURIOUS BECAUSE I KEEP HEARING THESE WORDS AND THEY'RE THEY'RE NOT MAKING SENSE TO ME FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND THE ACTUAL BUSINESS MODEL IS SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET TO THAT. WHAT WHAT WHAT? THE CURRENT BUSINESS MODEL YEAH I UNDER BE I MEAN REALLY IF IT HEART CONTRACT WITH AN ARMED ROBBER [inaudible] I'M SORRY. I AM SO FRUSTRATED BY WHAT MY EXPERIENCE HAS BEEN DEALING OF COURSE WITH ORGANIZING WORKERS ARE OUR WORKERS ATTEMPTING TO ORGANIZE IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY AND WHAT. COMES HERE IN A SAD SO I WANT TO UNDERSTAND YOUR TALK ABOUT COMPANIES THAT HAVE DIRECT EMPLOYEES WHO DRIVE FOR A LIVING. YES OKAY INTO THERE MIGHT BEA PERCENTAGE IN THAT THE THE GROWTH OR THE FLOCKS AND HAVING MORE DELIVERIES COULD BE DONE BY OUTSOURCING THAT WORK.

FOR MANY YEARS TO COME THIS PARTICULAR SUPREME COURT CASE HAS CERTAINLY PUT A PARTICULAR ASPECT OF IT INTO THE FOREFRONT AND THAT'S PART PARTLY WHY OTHER WAS A COMMENT AS TO WHY THERE'S SO MUCH. SO SO MANY FOLKS TALKING THE EITHER IN FAVOR ONE SIDE MORE SO THE OTHER WHILE. THE LOG LAND RIGHT NOW IS DYNAMICS AS IT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO START BY GETTING UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THAT CASE MEANT -- RATHER THAN HEARING DISSENTING OPINIONS TO THE CASE BECAUSE WE ARE NOT.

IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT I THINK -- AND I APPRECIATE EVERYONE THAT SPOKE AS PANELISTS TODAY IN ORDER TO HELP TO SET CONTACTS -- FOR HOW WE'RE GOING TO PROCEED GOING INTO THE FUTURE -- I ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO STAY ENGAGED -- BUT OBVIOUSLY I THINK EVERYONE THAT HAS SPENT THE TIME TO BE HERE TODAY AS WELL AS THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN OBSERVING UP OF THE THE STREAMING OF IT AND WHAT HAVE YOU. UNDERSTAND NOW HOW COMPLEX THIS ISSUE A DID THIS MORNING TRYING OUR BEST. EIGHT AND THERE WILL LIKELY BE ONE OR MORE BILLS WHO KNOWS THAT COMES FORWARD -- BUT TODAY THIS MORNING WAS REALLY ABOUT US AS A COMMITTEE AB STARTING TO GET AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT REALLY -- IS AT STAKE BUT ALSO TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT.
