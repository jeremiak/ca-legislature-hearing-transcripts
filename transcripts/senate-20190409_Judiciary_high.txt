THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- MADAM CHAIR -- SOMETIMES IT TAKES A FEW -- A FEW A FEW GOES OUT AND SO WE'LL GET IT RIGHT THIS TIME I KNOW -- AND I I'M I'M SURE I WANT TO THANK YOU -- AND YOUR STAFF -- PROFUSELY FOR WORKING VERY VERY HARD WITH US -- TO IMPROVE THIS BILL WERE VERY APPRECIATIVE OF OF THAT WORK AND AFTER I THINK IT IS A BETTER BILL. AS A RESULT OF THAT WORK. SENATE BILL -- FIFTY IS AN EFFORT TO ENSURE THAT -- BE HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP PILOT PROGRAM THAT WE PASSED LAST YEAR OF WHICH IS SB -- TEN FORTY FIVE CAN BE -- IMPLEMENTED AS EFFECTIVELY. AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO SAVE LIVES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE. DYING ON OUR STREETS AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. HI THIS IS ABOUT -- A LIMITED NUMBER OF PEOPLE BUT PEOPLE WHO ARE IN CRISIS ON OUR STREETS SEWER. A SEVERELY MENTALLY ILL SEVERELY ADDICTED -- WHO ARE INCAPABLE OF CARING FOR THEMSELVES AND WHO ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACCEPTING VOLUNTARY SERVICES DESPITE MANY EFFORTS TO OFFER VOLUNTARY SERVICES? IT IS NOT PROGRESSIVE OR COMPASSIONATE -- TO ALLOW PEOPLE -- TO UNRAVELED TO DETERIORATE AND ULTIMATELY TO DIE. ON OUR STREETS THE PROGRESSIVE AND COMPASSIONATE THING TO DO -- IS TO HELP THEM. FIND TO BE CLEAR -- WE CURRENTLY DO HAVE A CONSERVATORSHIP Là PROGRAM THAT IS VERY ROBUST IN CALIFORNIA -- AND IT'S CALLED JAIL -- PEOPLE CYCLE THROUGH OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM -- MANY INTERACTIONS WITH THE POLICE WHEN WE SHOULD BE ACTUALLY GETTING THEM IN THE HOUSING. AND SERVICES AND HELPING THEM -- WE INITIALLY INTRODUCED US SENATE BILL -- FORTY AS A VERY -- FOCUS BILL TO ADDRESS A COUPLE OF ISSUES. THAT WE NEEDED TO AFFECTS OFFER MUST BE. TEN FORTY FIVE FIVE AND THEN TO THE WORK OF THIS COMMITTEE -- WE HAVE DONE SOME RESTRUCTURING ON THE BILL -- AND MADE IT EVEN MORE DUE PROCESS HAVING THAN IT WAS BEFORE I SAY HAVE BEEN A GOOD WAY -- AND TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE TRULY FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE IN GREATEST NEED. THE BILL NOW SETS CLEAR STANDARDS FOR INITIATING A CONSERVATORSHIP RENEWING A CONSERVATORSHIP IN FOR ENDING THE CONSERVATORSHIP. RECENT AMENDMENTS WOULD REQUIRE NOTIFICATION OF A POTENTIAL CONSERVATIVE. BUT THERE SEVEN FIFTY ONE FIFTY AND A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD BECAUSE KEEP IN MIND THAT TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS CONSERVATORSHIP. YOU HAVE TO BE FIFTY ONE FIFTY EIGHT TIMES. IN A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD AFTER NUMBER SEVEN YOU WOULD RECEIVE OFFICIAL NOTICE THAT THE NEXT ONE COULD RESULT IN A CONSERVATORSHIP. THE BILL REQUIRES PARTICIPATING COUNTIES -- TO MAKE CONCERTED EFFORTS TO EMPLOY VOLUNTARY SERVICES -- BEFORE THE EIGHTH FIFTY ONE FIFTY HAPPENS THAT WAS -- WE HAD -- LANGUAGE THAT AFFECTED SB TEN FORTY FIVE IT'S NOW EVEN CLEARER. THE AMENDMENTS ALSO CREATE THE OPTION FOR COUNTY -- TO PURSUE A TWENTY EIGHT DAY TEMPORARY CONSERVATORSHIP AFTER THE A FIFTY ONE FIFTY WHICH COULD BE THE MORE APPROPRIATE OPTION IN A GIVEN CIRCUMSTANCE RATHER THAN GOING IMMEDIATELY TO THE PERMANENT. CONSERVATORSHIP. SB FORTY CLARIFIES THE LEGAL PROCESS FOR CONSIDERING THE USE OF ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT -- AND DETERMINING ITS APPLICABILITY TO POTENTIAL CONSERVATIVES RECOGNIZING THAT NOT EVERYONE IS MAD AN APPROPRIATE. CANDIDATE MEDICALLY ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT A WE DON'T WANT TO FORCE COUNTIES TO TRY TO PUT SOMEONE INTO A T. WHEN IT IS MEDICALLY INAPPROPRIATE. AND IN RECENT AMENDMENTS ARE ALSO REQUIRE THE IN ADDITION TO SHORTENING THE CONSERVATORSHIP FROM A YEAR TO SIX MONTHS. ALSO REQUIRES. A STATUS REPORT FOR EACH CONSERVANCY TO THE CORE EVERY SIXTY DAYS -- TO MAKE SURE THAT IF SOMEONE IS RECOVERING -- BEING CONSIDERED TERMINATING THE CONSERVATORSHIP EARLIER. WHEN WE VERY VERY CLEAR ON THAT I UNDERSTAND AND I RESPECT THE OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL? THIS IS A TOOL OF LAST RESORT. THIS IS FOR PEOPLE WERE OTHER TOOLS HAVE FAILED. AND WE WANT TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES I AM A STRONG SUPPORTER OF FUNDING VOLUNTARY SERVICES I CAST MANY VOTES AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. AND AS A SENATOR TO SUPPORT INCREASED SERVICES THAT ARE VOLUNTARY IN NATURE -- AND THIS BILL IN THIS PILOT PROGRAM WILL NOT SUPPLANT THOSE VOLUNTARY EFFORTS -- FOR ME THIS IS ABOUT HELPING THOSE WHO ARE TRULY AT THE END OF THE ROAD AND WE WANT TO SAVE THEIR LIVES. SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. AND WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY HI IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS THE MAYOR OF SAN FRANCISCO LONDON BREED. THANK YOU AND WELCOME MADAM MAYOR WE'RE DELIGHTED YOU'RE HERE AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL AS WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR JACKSON AND THANK YOU TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF COMMITTEE TODAY FOR ALLOW ME AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ABOUT SOMETHING THAT WE KNOW. IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FACING ESPECIALLY MANY OF OUR MAJOR CITIES. THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU SENATOR WINNER FOR YOUR CONTINUED EFFORTS TO ASSIST US IN ADDRESSING -- WHAT WE KNOW IS A REAL CRISIS A CRISIS AROUND HOMELESSNESS A MENTAL HEALTH -- CHALLENGES AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS THAT WE KNOW WHO ARE SUFFERING FROM A COMBINATION OF ALL THREE WHICH IS WHAT BRINGS US HERE TODAY. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE EXPERIENCING JUST ONE OF THESE PARTICULAR SYMPTOMS IT IS CHALLENGING ENOUGH BUT FROM SOMEONE WHO'S EXPERIENCING ALL THREE IT IS BEEN A REAL PROBLEM IN SAN FRANCISCO. THE REALITY IS SAD REPEATING THE CYCLES WHERE PEOPLE ARE LIVING ON THE STREETS CYCLE GOING IN AND OUT OF OUR EMERGENCY ROOMS. AND IN AND OUT OF OUR JAILS OVER AND OVER AGAIN. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT WE CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH AND WHEN I WAS A MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS THERE WERE A NUMBER OF PEOPLE IN MY DISTRICT. THAT WE SPECIFICALLY TRIED TO HELP WITH VERY LIMITED TOOLS TO ADDRESS WHAT WE KNOW IS A REAL CHALLENGE ONE GENTLEMAN IN PARTICULAR. HE WAS WELL KNOWN TO ALL THE NEIGHBORS ALL THE MERCHANTS ALL OF US THE POLICE WE ALL DID OUR VERY BEST TO TRY AND ASSIST HIM. BUT SADLY HE'S STILL OUT IN THE COMMUNITY HE STILL CONTINUES TO STRUGGLE AND IN FACT WHEN HE GETS IS TACK AT THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH HE HAS MONEY GETS TAKEN BY SOME OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD. HE HAS SERIOUS PROBLEMS AND THIS PARTICULAR BILL I'M FIGHTING REALLY HARD BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE HIM GET THE HELP AND THE SUPPORT THAT HE NEEDS -- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT YOU KNOW MANY OF THE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE TRYING TO HELP THEY DON'T NECESSARILY. HAVE THE GUARDIANS THEY DON'T NECESSARILY MAYBE HAVE THE FAMILY SUPPORT -- AND SO WE WERE VERY LIMITED AND GETTING THIS PARTICULAR INDIVIDUAL SUPPORT. SO THE ISSUES THAT HE WAS CLEARLY STRUGGLING WITH WENT UNTREATED AND IS CONTINUING HIS CONDITION CONTINUES. TO DETERIORATE. IT'S BEEN HEARTBREAKING BECAUSE IT WAS CLEAR TO EVERYONE THAT'S INVOLVED THAT HE NEEDED HELP. AND WE ARE NOT ABLE TO USE ANYTHING THAT EXISTS IN TERMS OF THE LAW TO HELP HIM OTHER THAN WHAT WE'RE HOPING -- WILL HELP -- IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL TODAY. THIS IS HAPPENING EVERY DAY WITH PEOPLE ALL OVER THE CITY AND ITS ON HEALTHY AND IT DOES NOT ADDRESS. THE ROOT CAUSES AB PLAY IT ALLOWS THEIR CONTINUED CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE. AND IT PLACES A TREMENDOUS FINANCIAL RESTRAINTS ON OUR RESOURCES IN THE CITY. NOW WE KNOW THAT SB TEN FOUR FIVE HELPS ADDRESS A CRITICAL NEED IN SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE IT DOES OFFER A WAY TO HELP SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS. THIS COULD HAPPEN TO ANY OF OUR FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS OR OURSELVES AT ANY GIVEN TIME BUT OUR CURRENT LAWS MAKE IT NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE TO GET THOSE INDIVIDUALS STABILIZED. AND HEALTHY FOR THE LONG TERM AND I KNOW THAT IF IT WERE ME STRUGGLING WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER I WOULD WANT SOMEONE TO STEP IN AND HELP. ME GT THE SUPPORT THAT I NEED AND THE LAST NUMBER OF MONTHS AS WE'VE WORKED ON IMPLEMENTING SB TEN FOUR FIVE WE'VE IDENTIFIED A FEW AREAS OF THAT BILL. THAT NEEDS SOME ADJUSTMENTS IN TO ENSURE THAT WE CAN SERVE THE POPULATION THAT THE ORIGINAL BILL WAS INTENDED TO SERVE. SB FORTY ADVANCES THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND TO BE CLEAR SB FORTY DOES NOT EXPAND THE POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS ELIGIBLE FOR A HOUSING CONSERVATIVES. IN SAN FRANCISCO THAT NUMBER WOULD REMAIN THE FIFTY TO SEVENTY FIVE PEOPLE THAT WE WANT TO HELP INCLUDING THIS INDIVIDUAL THAT I AM SO DESPERATE TO ENSURE. THAT HE GETS THE SUPPORT AND THE HOUSING THAT HE NEEDS TO THRIVE IN OUR CITY. RATHER THIS BILL REINFORCES THE ORIGINAL INTENT OF SB TEN FOUR FIVE THERE'S A CORE POPULATION OF INDIVIDUALS WHO WE CAN'T HELP TODAY WE WANT TO HELP THROUGH A HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP. AND SB FORTY WILL HELP ENSURE THAT WE CAN REACH THEM AS DRAFTED TODAY AS BE TEN FOUR FIVE WOULD ALLOW US TO HELP FEWER THAN. FIVE INDIVIDUALS NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE OTHER PILOT COUNTIES HAVE IDENTIFIED SIMILAR SMALL NUMBERS AND OUR CITY HAS A LONG HISTORY. OF PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE CARE AND I DON'T TAKE. YOU KNOW THE LIGHTLY THE IDEA OF LIMITING SOMEONE'S CIVIL LIBERTIES AND I KNOW THAT ALL OF YOU DON'T TAKE THAT LIGHTLY EITHER. WE SHOULD ALWAYS TRY TO HELP PEOPLE IN THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE WAYS AND IT IS OUR MORAL OBLIGATION TO DO JUST THAT. BUT WHEN PEOPLE DON'T ACCEPT OUR HELP AND THE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT THEY MAY DIE ON OUR STREETS THEN IT'S REALLY OUR OBLIGATION TO STEP IN. I'M HERE BECAUSE WE HAVE A CHANCE TO MAKE A MEANINGFUL DIFFERENCE BY PROVIDING MUCH NEEDED SERVICES TO OUR HARDEST TO REACH POPULATION WHETHER IT'S LIVES OF SAN FRANCISCANS OR JUST. ONE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE EFFECTIVE IN DELIVERING THE KIND OF SUPPORT THAT WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE OR WE CAN FEEL A DIFFERENCE ON OUR STREETS AND THOSE PERSONS COULD LIVE AND THRIVE IN SAN FRANCISCO. AND I AM HOPEFUL THAT THIS COMMITTEE WILL SUPPORT SB FORTY AND AGAIN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK ABOUT. THIS VERY CRITICAL ISSUE THIS IS JUST THE FIRST STEP IN SEOUL MUCH MORE THAT WE NEED TO DO IN THIS STATE TO ADDRESS MENTAL HEALTH REFORM SO THAT WE CAN REALLY BEGAN TO HELP PEOPLE EVEN BEFORE THEY GET TO SUCH A DIRE. SITUATION ON OUR STREETS THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH. THANK YOU MADAM MAYOR AND TO OTHER ANY OTHER WITNESSES OF RIVER. TELL YOUR MOTOR FROM SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WHO WILL BE BRIEF. YES PLACER WE GAVE A LITTLE CONSIDERATION THE FACT THAT WE HAD THE MAYOR HERE BUT PLEASE IF YOU KEEP IT TO TWO MINUTES FOR LESS THANK YOU. AND GOOD AFTERNOON SURE JACKSON COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS KELLY HERE MOTO I'M THE DIRECTOR SAN FRANCISCO HEALTH NETWORK TRANSITIONS WITH SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. MY TEAM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BURKE FOR PROVIDING APPROPRIATE PLACEMENT FOR INDIVIDUALS WERE PLACED ON CONSERVATORSHIP OR DO NOT HAVE A PLACE TO GO AFTER LEAVING THE HOSPITAL. A SERVICES GOES BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT THE NEW HOUSING CONCERT SHIP ESTABLISHED UNDER SB TEN FORTY FIVE WE'VE ENCOUNTERED CHALLENGES THAT ARE IMPACTING OUR ABILITY TO REACH THE SUBSET OF THE POPULATION IS MOST IN NEED. THE AMENDMENTS PER A PROPOSED IN SB FORTY WILL HELP US REACH THE DISTINCT AT RISK POPULATION UNABLE TO ENGAGE INVOLUNTARY SERVICES AND SO REMAIN SUFFERING. OUT OF CARE I'D LIKE TO OFFER AN EXAMPLE OF SOMEONE IN THIS SITUATION MISS SMITH IS A THIRTY EIGHT YEAR OLD WOMAN WHO IS A BI POLAR DEPRESSION DIAGNOSIS IS AN ACTIVE USER OF METHAMPHETAMINES. SHE SMOKES INJECTS DRUGS IN PUBLIC VERBALLY ABUSES PEOPLE AS THEY PASSED BY HAS VISIBLE OPEN WOUNDS IN STORES AND AS HOSTILE OUT REACH TEAMS IN THE PAST MONTH SHE'S HAD TWO VISITS TO PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY IN ONE VISIT TO THE EMERGENCY ROOM. DURING A RECENT FIFTY ONE FIFTY HOLD SHE WAS AGITATED THREATENING AND HAD PARANOID DELUSIONS OF HARM HER CASE WAS PRESENTED AT A FIFTY TO FIFTY PROBABLE CAUSE HEARING BUT DENIED BECAUSE SHE DIDN'T NOT PRESENT AS AN IMMEDIATE DANGER TO HERSELF OR OTHERS AT THE TIME. AND WAS NOT DEEMED GRAVELY DISABLED. SHE WAS ABLE TO STAY WHERE SHE GOES FOR FOOD AND SHELTER AND THAT SHE WANTED TO BE OUT OF THE HOSPITAL SHE'S GIVING MEDICATIONS OFFERED REFER ON RECONNECTION WITH COMMUNITY PROVIDERS. FOUR DAYS LATER SHE WAS BACK IN PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY FOR HAVING ADDRESSED IN PUBLIC WALKED INTO TRAFFIC AND ACTED AGGRESSIVELY TOWARDS CARS AND PEDESTRIANS. UNFORTUNATELY I COULD SHARE MORE EXAMPLES LIKE THIS INCLUDING ONES OF AGING INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE SERIOUS MENTAL ILLNESS SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AND OTHER CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES OR HIV. SERVICES GO HAS A LONG HISTORY OF PROVIDING COMPASSIONATE KAREN FOLLOWING A RECOVERY ORIENTED MODEL THE CITY CONVENES INTERAGENCY WORK GROUPS TO CREATE CARE PLANS FOR THE HIGHEST UTILIZES OF SYSTEMS. AND SOME AMONG THIS GROUP HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE CITY FOR YEARS WE'VE NOT BEEN ABLE TO HELP THEM STABILIZE THEIR ABILITY FOR SELF CARE HIS DETERIORATED OVER TIME AND THEY'RE NOT IN A PLACE WHERE THEY WILL ACCEPT VOLUNTARY SERVICES. SB FORTY AMENDMENTS WILL HELP US REACH CLIENTS LIKE MISS SMITH WHO DO NOT MEET CRITERIA FOR ASSISTED OUTPATIENT THERAPY BUT NEED ASSISTANCE TO GET TO A BETTER PLACE THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARE THERE OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. IF YOU COME TO THE MICROPHONE GIVE US YOUR NAME. AFFILIATION AND INDICATE YOUR SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA AND STRONG SUPPORT WE WANTED THINK SENATOR WIENER AND MAYOR BREED FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND THE REPRESENTATIVE SANTA MONICA'S PROBABLY RIGHT ACROSS THE WAY AND NATURAL RESOURCES IF YOU WANT TO REMIND AMIR HERE I'M SURE THAT WOULD BE. A NICE GESTURE. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. HI IT IS INACCESSIBLE MIKE FOR WOULD YOU PREFER THAT USE THAT. ONE WORK. THANK YOU THAT'S VERY GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR JACKSON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS JESSICA LEHMAN I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF SAN FRANCISCO SENIOR AND DISABILITY ACTION. AND WE'RE PART OF THE VOLUNTARY SERVICES FIRST COALITION I'M WHICH IS A COALITION OF OVER TWO DOZEN COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS WHO OPPOSE THE EXPANSION OF CONSERVATORSHIP IN THIS WAY UNDER. SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND WE OPPOSE SB. FORTY AND THESE GROUPS INCLUDE THE ACLU DISABILITY RIGHTS PROGRAM THE COALITION ON HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH ASSOCIATION OF SAN FRANCISCO GRAY PANTHERS MANY MORE. AND HIS BASICALLY ALL COMMUNITY GROUPS THAT ARE WORKING WITH HOMELESS PEOPLE PEOPLE OF MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS AND AND PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES AND THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A SPLIT RIGHT NOW BETWEEN THE ELECTED LEADERSHIP. IN SAN FRANCISCO AND THE COMMUNITY AS FAR AS WHETHER THIS IS THE RIGHT APPROACH OR NOT. OUR COALITION IS NOT OPPOSED TO CONSERVATORSHIP AS IT CURRENTLY EXISTS. WE ARE OPPOSED TO THIS PARTICULAR EXPANSION THE MAJOR REASON IS THAT SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE VOLUNTARILY ALL OF OUR ORGANIZATIONS ON THE GROUND HERE EVERY DAY FROM PEOPLE WHO CANNOT GET ACCESS TO HOUSING. ONCE A MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES THERE ARE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WAITING FOR HOUSING THERE ARE PEOPLE WAITING FOR MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES. A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH AUDIT AND SAN FRANCISCO IN TWENTY SEVENTEEN SHOWED THAT 40% OF PEOPLE ARE RELEASED FROM PSYCHIATRIC EMERGENCY SERVICES WITH NO REFERRALS. WE ALSO HAVE A DESPERATE NEED FOR INTENSIVE CASE MANAGEMENT NOT JUST SOMEBODY WHO'S IN AN OFFICE WHO HAS AN APPOINTMENT WITH SOMEBODY WHO'S ABLE TO GET THERE. BUT SOMEBODY WHO WILL GO OUT AND FIND SOMEONE WHERE THEY ARE MAYBE TWO OR THREE TIMES A DAY IF NEEDED AT NIGHT ON WEEKENDS TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE PERSON. TO BUILD A RELATIONSHIP AND BUILD TRUST WITH SOMEBODY WHO HAS BEEN ABUSED BY THE SYSTEM SOMEONE WHO DOESN'T TRUST AUTHORITY. WE HAVE SEEN THIS WORK IN OTHER CITIES WHERE YOU CAN GET THE PERSON TO ACCEPT SERVICES. WE ALSO CAN'T SAY THE PEOPLE ARE INCAPABLE OF ACCEPTING SERVICES WHEN WE KNOW SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE NOT BEEN OFFERED SERVICES. AND SOME PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN OFFERED SERVICES HAVEN'T BEEN OFFER THEM IN A COORDINATED WAY IF YOU GET OUT OF A SUBSTANCE USE PROGRAM BUT YOU STILL DON'T HAVE HOUSING HOW ARE YOU GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY OFF DRUGS WE DON'T HAVE A SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR PEOPLE. WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CUTS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AND THOSE NEED TO BE RESTORED WE NEED TO BE PUTTING OUR MONEY INTO VOLUNTARY SERVICES. BEFORE WE PUT MONEY INTO AN EXTRA ADMINISTERED ADMINISTRATIVE PROGRAM LAKE THIS. WE ALSO KNOW THAT IF SERVICES ARE NOT AVAILABLE IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO GET CAN SERVICE PEOPLE INTO SERVICES WITHOUT DISPLACING OTHERS WHICH MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND SAN FRANCISCO. THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HAS NOT VOTED TO IMPLEMENT SB TEN FORTY FIVE AND SO WE THINK IT'S PREMATURE TO LOOK AT AMENDING IT WITH SB. FORTY WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WITH THE INCREASED INVOLVEMENT OF POLICE AND BY TYING CONSERVATORSHIP TO THE FIFTY ONE FIFTY PROCESS THERE'S A LOT OF ANTI HOMELESS SENTIMENT IN SAN FRANCISCO RIGHT NOW THERE'S A DESIRE TO GET PEOPLE OFF THE STREETS. AND THIS IS THE WRONG WAY TO DO IT WE DESPERATELY NEED SOME PROTECTIONS AND SB TEN FORTY FIVE WAS AMENDED. TO ADD SOME OF THOSE PROTECTIONS THANKS TO YOUR COMMITTEE ON OTHERS. AND ASSISTED OUTPATIENT TREATMENT IS ONE OF THOSE WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD CHANGE THE PROCESS WHERE THE CITY CAN DECLARE THAT A PERSON DOESN'T FIT A. O. T.. RATHER THAN GOING THROUGH THE PROCESS SO WE URGE YOU TO TWO POTS ON THIS LET SAN FRANCISCO LOOK AT WHAT CAN WE DO TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE GET THE SERVICES THAT THEY NEED. IN A WAY THAT RESPECTS THEIR AGENCY THEIR SELF DETERMINATION AND IS MORE EFFECTIVE IN THE LONG RUN THAN INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT. AND PLEASE VOTE NO ON SB FORTY THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS IF YOU COULD BE. PLEASE. THANK YOU COMMITTEE MY NAME'S DE ANDRE DAVIS I'M A SUPERVISING PUBLIC GUARDIAN -- AND US SMALL SPECIALIZED STATEWIDE -- WORK FORCE OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ENGAGE THESEVERELY AND PERSISTENTLY MENTALLY ILL POPULATION -- MANY OF WHOM ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS -- INTO INVOLUNTARY TREATMENT -- UNDER THE O. P. S. ACT. I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF SEIU CALIFORNIA WHICH REPRESENTS NOT ONLY PUBLIC GUARDIANS. BUT ALSO FRONT LINE HOMELESS OUTREACH AND BEHAVIOR HEALTH WORKERS WHO PROVIDE CASE MANAGEMENT AND DIRECT SERVICES TO INDIVIDUALS. EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS MENTAL ILLNESS. OR WHO ARE LIVING WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE DISORDERS. IT IS BECAUSE OF OUR DIRECT EXPERIENCE WITH THESE POPULATIONS THAT WE ORIGINALLY OF POLLS SB. FORTY WE'RE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR AND AND THIS COMMITTEE. FOR IMPROVING SB FORTY BY REMOVING THE LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW. FOR CONSERVATORSHIP BASED SOLELY ON SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. CONSERVATORSHIP TO THE POWERFUL TOOL -- THAT CAN WORK WELL WHEN WHEN THE APPROPRIATE RESOURCES ARE ARE AVAILABLE TO OUR OUR POPULATION. HOWEVER IS NOT A SOLUTION THAT ELVES OUR STATE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE CHANGE. WITH THE CHANGE SB TEN FORTY FIVE PILOT AUTHORIZED LAST YEAR. AND LAID OUT IN SB. FORTY FIRST THE BILL STILL REMOVES THE REQUIREMENT FROM LAST YEAR'S INDIVIDUAL. LAST YEAR THE INDIVIDUALS GO TO LAURA'S LAW. FIRST. IF THAT PEACE IS STILL MISSING THE INTENT TO FOCUS ON COMPULSORY S. UT TREATMENT AT SOME POINT. IF SO WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE INVENTORY OF SERVICE OF THE THE INVENTORY OF SERVICES. LOOKS LIKE THAT. THAT IS INTENDED FOR THE POPULATION AND WHAT WOULD LIKE. AND WHAT IT WOULD LOOK LIKE THROUGH STEP DOWN TO LOWER LEVELS OF CARE. WE CONTINUE TO HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE QUESTIONABLE THERAPEUTIC VALUES OF COMPOSED SOARING -- AS HE TREATMENT IN THE ABSENCE OF A SERIOUS PERSISTENTLY MENTALLY ILL. COR MOBILITY IF YOU IF YOU COULD WRAP IT UP PLEASE. I LIKE TO SPEAK FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE -- TO THE CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLACEMENTS AND THE BAD TO THIS POPULATION -- CERTAIN SERVICES SUCH AS OUR INVOLUNTARY DRUG TREATMENT THOSE SERVICES THOSE ARE FACILITIES CURRENTLY DO NOT EXIST THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY THANK YOU VERY HELPFUL I'M SURE AND I SUSPECT THE MAYOR'S LISTEN CAREFULLY -- BECAUSE WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IS THERE'S JUST A LACK OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES -- FOR ALL THE PEOPLE ACROSS THE VARIOUS -- SPECTRUMS -- AND I'M SURE THAT THAT WAS FOR BY BOTH THE SENATOR AND AND THE MAYOR AND I THINK THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- SO OTHER WITNESSES OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU COME FORWARD PLEASE THE MICROPHONE WITH YOUR NAME AFFILIATION AND STATED OPPOSITION. BUT A TRACKER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WE REMAIN OPPOSE FOR THE REASONS THAT WE'VE STATED ALL ALONG AND PARTICULARLY AS THE THIS BILL WAS AN EFFORT TO UNDO. A. O. T. AS A ESSENTIAL PART OF TEN FORTY FIVE ALL ALONG AND AND SO ALTHOUGH THERE WAS SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS MADE WE APPRECIATE THAT PART STILL -- LEAVES US WITH -- OUR OPPOSITION AND VERY MUCH THANKS TO THE STAFF AND TO THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK YOU DID BRING THE SALON THANK YOU VERY MUCH. TEN FLORA BEHALF OF WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO ECHOING THE SAME SENTIMENTS AND APPRECIATE THE WORK OF THE STAFF. JOINT VENTURE MEMBERS KEVIN BECAUSE THEY'RE CONSERVE LIBERTIES UNION A CALIFORNIA ALSO REGRETTABLY STILL OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. DAVID WILLIAMS MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA WINES FOR RETIRED AMERICANS AND AS HE ARE YOU WE BOTH OPPOSE THANK YOU THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M FOR ADVOCATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES I AM A WHAT WE CALL A TWEENER WE DO NOT HAVE AN OFFICIAL SUPPORT OR OPPOSE POSITION YET WE DO HAVE CONCERNS BUT THE AMENDMENTS AND THE WORK THAT THE COMMITTEE AND AUTHOR HAS. DONE SO FAR IS GREAT PROGRESS AS A WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND BEFORE WE GET TO THE QUESTIONS FROM THE MEMBERS -- THAT WAS A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT WHAT THE BILL WAS LAST YEAR WE'VE MADE -- WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE AUTHOR AND VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS THERE HAVE BEEN. SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO THIS LEGISLATION TO TRY TO PROTECT. OF IN TO PRESERVE THE LPS PROCESS WHICH IS CONSTITUTIONALLY MANDATED -- THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LOWER IS LAW IN THE A. O. T. EFFORT I THINK WE HAVE ADDRESSED AT LEAST IN MAJOR PORTION AND I DO KNOW THE AUTHOR IS. PREPARED TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS HERE THE BILL ADD SODIUM MOST RECENT AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE NOW ACTUALLY INCORPORATED INTO THE BILL. ADD AN OBJECTIVE STANDARD IF THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTOR DOES NOT SEEK A QUARTER FOR THE FOR NAY -- T. -- AND AGAIN THAT IS A PREREQUISITE TO A HOUSING CONSERVATORSHIP UNDER SB. TEN FORTY FIVE THE PRIOR VERSION OF SB A FORTY WOULD HAVE LET THE DIRECTOR MAKE A DETERMINATION WITHOUT ANY ACCOUNTABILITY THAT WAS NOT ACCEPTABLE SO WE'VE ADDED OBJECTIVE FACTORS TO THAT. I THAN COULD GO INTO DETAIL ITEM BY ITEM BY ITEM -- LET ME JUST SUGGEST THAT THIS IS STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT I WOULD SAY THAT -- THAT THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKEN THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE I THINK. WE'LL PUT THIS IN A POSITION THAT IT DOES -- ADEQUATELY ADDRESS LPS ISSUES AND LIKE SO MUCH OTHER WONDERFUL WORK WE DO IT IF THE OPPOSITION ISN'T PLEASE WITH THAT THEY'LL. THEY'LL BRING. IN ALL SUIT AND WILL END UP PERHAPS AGAIN WITH THE STATE SUPREME COURT MAKING THAT DECISION BUT I THINK UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES YOU'VE DONE A A VERY FINE JOB MAKING THIS. A MUCH LESS HARPER AND THEN I FELT LAST YEAR WHEN WE DID AGREE TO MAKE THIS A PILOT BUT I THINK THIS DOES. IMPROVE UPON IT AND A WE HAVE A MORE EFFECTIVE AND MORE CONSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK. AS FAR AS THE COMMENTS ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND I APPRECIATE HER FOR THE MAYOR SAY THE SAME THING. WE'RE NOT DOING AN ADEQUATE JOB ON DEALING WITH MENTAL HEALTH PERIOD. WHETHER IT'S OUR YOUNGSTERS WHO ARE OUT THERE ARE EXPRESSING SUICIDAL IDEATION AT THE AGES OF NINE TO THOSE WHO ARE IN THEIR EARLY AND PRETEEN YEARS COMMITTING SUICIDE. A TO OUR COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THOSE OF OUR YOUTH THE THE WHOLE -- MENTALITY. ALL OF OUR POPULATION HIT HIS SUFFERING FROM SEVERE. STRESS AND AND EVEN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND IT IS. ABOUT TIME WE TOOK THIS IS A VERY VERY SERIOUS A PUBLIC HEALTH PROBLEM. THAT BEING SAID THOUGH THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO ARE NOW TRULY AT THAT DANGEROUS TIPPING POINT AND I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL TRIES TO ADDRESS -- WE DO KNOW THAT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT HAS COME OUT OF I THINK IT WAS -- PROPOSITION -- SIXTY THREE THAT IS AVAILABLE NOW TO COMMUNITIES FOR MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT TO AND I AM CONFIDENT SAN FRANCISCO IS -- IN THE FOREFRONT ON THAT LOS ANGELES HAS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT. IS SITTING THERE WE HAVE TO ASK WHY THAT IS BUT THAT'S NOT THE BILL HERE TODAY -- WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE'S HOW TO TAKE THE MOST SEVERELY -- MENTALLY ILL FOLKS AND GIVE THEM TREATMENT OR PUT THEM INTO SOME KIND OF PROGRAM THAT IS DESIGNED TO TRY TO HELP THEM. AND SO ARE YOU -- AGAIN WANT TO THANK THE SENATOR I WANT TO THANK THE MAYOR WITH WHOM I HAVE SPOKEN I WANT TO ALSO THANK OUR STAFF. OF FOR WORKING VERY VERY HARD ON THIS BILL I GENERALLY I DON'T LIKE TO CHANGE SOMETHING BEFORE IT'S EVEN BEEN PUT INTO PLAY. BUT THERE ARE EXCEPTIONS AND I THINK THIS WAS ONE OF THEM -- SO I I WANTED TO SHARE MY THOUGHTS BECAUSE WE DID TRUST AMEND THIS BILL LAST WEEK IT IS IN PRINT HOWEVER. GIVEN THE PUBLIC AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND I THINK THERE ARE A LOT OF CONCERNS. THAT ARE LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT -- WE CAN CAN TRIGGER CONTINUE TO TRY TO ADDRESS GOING FORWARD AND I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE SENATOR WINNER HE WILL DO THAT SO -- IF THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS WE'LL START WITH SENATOR BORCHARD SHIN AND TO SENATOR ON BURKE. OUR MOTION WITH THE BILL SENATOR UMBERG THE QUESTION OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR FOR BRINGING THIS TO OUR ATTENTION IS A VERY CHALLENGING ISSUE. WOULD YOU CONSIDER GETTING ORANGE COUNTY AS FOR THE PILOT PROJECT. I'M. SAID THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER ON BURKE -- WHEN THIS WHEN I FIRST INTRODUCED AS BE TEMPERED FIVE LAST YEAR -- WE INTRODUCED IT AS A FIFTY EIGHT COUNTY -- PROGRAM -- IN THIS COMMITTEE LAST YEAR WORKING WITH THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE NARROWED IT TO A TO COUNTY PILOT SAN FRANCISCO LOS ANGELES. IN ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS OF EXPANDED TO A THIRD COUNTY. SAN DIEGO -- AND SO -- WELL I THINK THAT THAT IS A VERY REASONABLE CONVERSATION TO HAVE AT THE AT THIS POINT THE THE BILL AS IT WAS IN THEIR LAST YEAR IS A PILOT PROGRAM IN A FEW COUNTIES -- AND YES I IT'S A REMOTE SORT OF WHERE WE ARE IN THE BILL IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT. THE NO OR MAYBE -- YEAH IF YOU'RE. IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE IF YOU ASK ME TO MAKE AN AMENDMENT TO OUT ORANGE COUNTY AND I'M NOT PREPARED TO DO THAT BECAUSE OF THE AGREEMENT. THAT WE STRUCK WITH THE COMMITTEE LAST YEAR TO NARROW IT TO NOT BE OFFICE THAT IS AT A MAYBE -- NO. YOUR AYE AYE I'M NOT PREPARED TO MAKE THAT AMENDMENT -- SENATOR. WELL A PART OF THE PROBLEM IS SO THAT THE BILL THAT WE NEED BY IN FROM THESE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE WE ARE ASKING THEM TO DO A LOT. AND THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO EXPEND THE RESOURCES AND WHAT WE WANTED TO DO IS FIRST. SEE IF THIS IF THIS COULD WORK THIS IS A AN ELEGANT I THINK EFFORT TO TRY TO THREAD A NEEDLE -- AND SO THE I KNOW MANY OF OUR COUNTY SO I HEARD FROM MY OWN COUNTIES THAT WANTED TO BE INCLUDED BUT I THINK AS A START IF THIS IS SUCCESSFUL IT WILL EXPAND AND SHOULD EXPAND. GREAT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WE HAVE A MOTION OF ANY FURTHER COMMENTS SEEING NONE OF SENATOR FOOD LIKE TO CLOSE I THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU TO ALL MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE AND AGAIN THANK YOU THE COMMITTEE STAFF -- I DO I DO THIS -- ONE TO TO MENTION A FEW THINGS -- BECAUSE I MEAN THERE WERE SME INACCURATE STATEMENTS THAT WERE. THAT WERE MADE NOT BY THE COMMITTEE -- TO CLEARLY WE NEED TO INVEST A LOT MORE IN MENTAL HEALTH AND ADDICTION SERVICES. THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT THE SAFETY NET IS NOT WHERE IT NEEDS TO BE. BUT TO TO TO SUGGEST WALKING HERE AND SUGGEST THAT YOU SIMPLY YOU CAN'T GET THOSE VOLUNTARY SERVICES. IN SAN FRANCISCO ON IT IS THAT THAT IS SO IT'S INACCURATE IN THE EXTREME. AND PARTICULARLY WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST IN CRISIS. PEOPLE WHO RIGHT NOW WE ARE INVESTING HUGE RESOURCES INTO THEIR CYCLING THROUGH OUR EMERGENCY ROOM ON A REGULAR BASIS CYCLING THROUGH OUR JAILS. THE VOLUNTARY SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE FOR THIS SMALL UNIVERSE OF PEOPLE ABSOLUTELY BUT THEY ARE NOT CAPABLE OF ACCESSING IT BECAUSE OF THE CONDITION THAT THERE AND O I TAKE ISSUE. WITH THAT STATEMENT BUT THIS IS JUST WE DON'T WANT TO GIVE VOLUNTARY SERVICES WE JUST WANNA CONCERT PEOPLE CONSERVATORSHIP. THE LAST RESORT -- I ALSO -- THERE THERE WAS A SUGGESTION THAT E SHOULD. THAT BECAUSE THE SAN FRANCISCO BOARD OF SUPERVISORS HASN'T VOTED TO OPT ANYA THAT WE SHOULD THE LATEST BE. FORTY TO BE CLEAR OF THE OPPOSITION OF THE SOME OF THE OPPONENTS OF A OF THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS OPTING IN TO US THE TEMPORARY. FIVE IS BECAUSE IT ONLY AFFECTS A SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE AND SO IT'S NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE FOR US TO ACTUALLY OFTEN AND SO NOW WE'RE TRYING TO FIX IT SO THAT IT WILL REACH THE UNIVERSE THAT WE WANT TO REACH AND THEN THEY COME UP HERE. AND SAY WELL THEY HAVE AN OPTED IN YES HE SAID THE LIGHT -- WE WE NEED TO MOVE FORWARD AND GIVE SAN FRANCISCO THAT OPPORTUNITY AND THEN FINALLY -- IN TERMS OF BOUNCE OUT PATIENT TREATMENTS AND SUCH AN IMPORTANT BANG -- I I THINK IT. WOULD BE ON ETHICAL TO FORCE PUBLIC OFFICIALS TO SEEK A O. T. FOR PEOPLE FOR WHOM IT'S NOT MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE. THIS -- IS IMPORTANT STOP FOR OUR CITY AND FOR THE STATE AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST ARRIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER. THE MOTION IS TO PASSED THE SENATE PUBLIC SAFETY.

THEIR CHILDREN -- TODAY -- BECAUSE OF THE LACK OF APPROPRIATE -- I LIKE TO XIN SPACE IN MANY WORKPLACES. NEW MOTHERS ARE OFTEN CONFRONTED WITH THE UNACCEPTABLE CHOICE OF DO I RETURN TO WORK. OR DO I BREASTFEED MY CHILD -- THAT IS A FALSE CHOICE AND WE NEED TO MOVE AWAY. FROM THAT CHOICE -- THERE ARE SO MANY REASONS HEALTH WISE WHY IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR MOTHERS -- TO BE ABLE TO BREAST FEED THEIR CHILD. IN ADDITION WHEN WE WHEN MOTHERS ARE FORCED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE THEY MAY BY THE LAYING RETURNED TO WORK SUFFER ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OR THEY MAY RETURN TO WORK AND THEN HAVE TO START OF PURCHASING FORMULA. WHICH IS VERY EXPENSIVE. THIS ISSUE PARTICULARLY AFFECTS LOWER INCOME WOMEN AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR -- AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT -- ALL MOTHERS HAVE THAT CHOICE TO RETURN TO WORK WHEN THEY'RE READY -- AND NOT HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN BREAST FEEDING WORKING -- THE BILL -- IS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD IT REQUIRES THAT THERE BE A SPACEA PRIVATE SPACE -- FOR LIKE TO FOR EXPRESSING MILK -- WITH THE TABLE AND A CHAIR AN ELECTRIC OUTLET -- AND THEN -- NEARBY -- REFRIGERATION -- AVAILABLE -- THAT SPACE CAN BE FLEXIBLE WE PUT A LOT OF FLEXIBILITY IN THIS BILL PARTICULARLY FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES. AND BUSINESSES EXPERIENCING HARDSHIP FLEXIBILITY FOR BUSINESSES -- THAT ARE CO LOCATED TO SHARE SPACE -- AND ALSO SPECIAL FLEXIBILITY FOR THE AGRICULTURE. SECTOR -- AND ALSO FOR THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY AND WE WORKED ALL THAT OUT LAST YEAR UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE INDUSTRIES THAT OBVIOUSLY A VERY DIFFERENT -- SPACE SITUATIONS ON YOUR TRADITIONAL OFFICE -- SO -- THE I THINK THIS BILL -- IS A GOOD STEP FORWARD WE'RE COMMITTED TO THE ISSUE AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR BY VOTE -- IT BEFORE YOU OF BEFORE YOU INTRODUCE YOUR WITNESSES JUST FOR CLARIFICATION. I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ON PAGES EIGHT AND NINE INCOME AND FIVE IN THE NOW SINCE IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT THANK YOU. ARE FROM GOING TO NOT MANAGER -- AND WITH ME TODAY ARE TWO WITNESSES ARGENTA GEHRY FROM LEGAL AT WORK ENGINE THAT NEWMAN -- BILLOWS FROM THE SACRAMENTO BREASTFEEDING COALITION. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES EACH IF YOU WOULD YES GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME MY NAME IS JENNA GARY AND I'M A SENIOR STAFF ATTORNEY AT LEGAL AID AT WORK WHICH IS AN ORGANIZATION. THAT ADVOCATES FOR THE RIGHTS OF LOW INCOME WORKERS. I'M PROUD TO BE HERE TODAY AS A CO SPONSOR SB ONE FORTY TWO AND-IN STRONG SUPPORT. THE SIMPLY PUT SB ONE FORTY TWO WILL ENSURE ALL LACTATING PARENTS ARE ABLE TO MEET THE MOST BASIC NEED OF THEIR CHILD PROVIDING FOOD. EXISTING LAW DOES REQUIRE. EMPLOYERS PROVIDE LACTATING PARENTS A TIME AND SPACE TO EXPRESS BREAST MILK. BUT THESE VAGUE REQUIREMENTS ARE INSUFFICIENT FOR MOST WORKERS PARTICULARLY LOW WAGE WORKERS WE KNOW ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH DATA THAT A THIRD OF WORKING PARENTS REPORT THAT THEY HAVE NO WORKPLACE BREAST FEEDING SUPPORT. AND PARENTS OF THE LOWER HOUSEHOLD INCOMES ARE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE WORKPLACE READY FOR BREAST FEEDING SUPPORTS THAN THEIR PEERS. ALSO ALTHOUGH ASSEMBLY MEMBER LIMóN STILL FROM LAST YEAR WAS IMPORTANT FIRST STEP IN THAT IT CLARIFIED. CONSISTENT WITH FEDERAL LAW THAT THE SPACE COULD NOT BE A BATHROOM IT SIMPLY DID NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. INDEED AS A COMMITTEE NOW SAYS POINTED OUT IT WAS ALREADY A FEDERAL LAW THAT COULD NOT BE A BATHROOM AND WE THINK WOMEN DESERVE MORE SUPPORT FROM THAT. AT LEGAL AID AT WORK WE HAVE A WORKING FAMILY HELP LINE WHERE WE HEAR FROM THOUSANDS OF WORKERS EACH YEAR THAT ARE STRUGGLING WITH THESE ISSUES AND I JUST WANT TO SHARE THE STORY OF ONE SHE WAS A SERVER IN A RESTAURANT. WHEN SHE RETURNED TO WORK SHE ASKED FOR LACTATION COMBINATIONS THE ONLY PLACE THEY OFFERED HER IT WAS A STORAGE AREA WHEN NO PLACE TO SAY? NO PLACE TO PUT THE BOMB TO PLUG IN THE PUMP -- SO WHEN SHE TALKED TO EMPLOYER AND ASK FOR SUPPORT THE METER CHOOSE BETWEEN NO LONGER BREAST FEEDING OR RISKING HER FINANCIAL SECTOR SECURITY BY LEAVING. NO ONE SHOULD BE FORCED TO MAKE THAT CHOICE AND SB ONE FORTY TWO WILL ENSURE THAT THAT'S A REALITY. THAT'S FOR THESE REASONS RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE BELT. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS GENET NEWMAN VILLAS AND I AM REPRESENTING THE SACRAMENTO BREASTFEEDING COALITION OUR LOCAL COALITION AS WELL AS CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COALITION. THAT IS ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS FOR THIS BILL -- THANK YOU A CHAIR JACKSON MEMBERS FOR HEARING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS LEGISLATION. AS JENNA HAD MENTIONED THE CURRENT LABOR CODE THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE ISN'T QUITE ENOUGH I LIVE IT EVERY DAY BECAUSE I WORK WITH THE LOW INCOME POPULATION I WORK FOR THE WEEK PROGRAM AND HAVE FOR TWENTY SIX YEARS. AND I HAVE MOTHERS THAT COME TO ME AND SAY PLEASE GIVE ME FORMULA ITS FORMULA THAT YOU AND I PAY FOR IS TAXPAYERS BUT I KNOW THAT THOSE BABIES ARE GONNA BE NOT AS HEALTHY THOSE MOTHERS ARE NOT GOING TO BE AS HEALTHY. BECAUSE THEY'RE HAVING TO TAKE THE SECOND CHOICE INSTEAD OF THE FIRST CHOICE WHICH IS THAT A MOTHER SHOULD BE ABLE TO USE HER BREASTS TO MAKE PRESS NOT FOR HER BABY. THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THEY WERE MADE. FOR OKAY IS TO BE ABLE TO FEED BABIES AND WHAT WE'RE ASKING IS THIS LOBBY STRENGTHENED SO THAT NEW. NEW -- CONSTRUCTION CAN HAVE A PLACE WITH INTEGRATED INTO THE WORKPLACE SO THAT MOTHERS DON'T HAVE TO CHOOSE AND BE EMBARRASSED OR HARASS WHEN THEY ASKED THAT QUESTION -- ALSO JUST ADD JUST TO CONSIDER THIS IS A WAY OF CHANGING THE CULTURE SO THAT BREAST FEEDING IS CONSIDERED THE NORM IT'S NOT ABOUT A WOMAN'S CHOICE BECAUSE WOMEN. BY AND LARGE 94% OF WOMEN WANT TO BREAST FEED BUT IF THEY'RE CONCERNED THAT THEY CAN'T AND THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK AND BE ACCOMMODATED. THEY JUST CHOOSE TO DO OTHERWISE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR VOTING GIVING AN AYE VOTE FOR THIS LEGISLATION THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH THOSE IN SUPPORT AND THEN WE'RE GOING TO TAKE A LITTLE RECESS BECAUSE AS YOU'LL NOTE I'M THE ONLY ONE HERE AND I HAVE. TO GO ACROSS THE WAY TO VOTE THEIR LIFTING CALLS IN THE OTHER COMMITTEE SELF. NAME AND AFFILIATION PLEASE BRENT SPENCE ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF OBGYN IS DISTRICT NINE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON JESSICA CENTER ON BEHALF OF EQUAL RIGHTS ADVOCATES THE STRONGER CALIFORNIA ADVOCATES NETWORK AND THE CALIFORNIA EMPLOYMENT LAWYERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. ENTER MEMBERS KEVIN BACK OF AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS WITH THE BILL VERY GOOD THANK YOU. SO -- IS THERE IS THERE OPPOSITION. IMAGES GET A SENSE THERE IS. I'D LIKE YOU IF YOU WOULD WERE GONNA TAKE A FIVE MINUTE RECESS AND THEN WE WILL. RECONVENE MY APOLOGIES BUT THERE IS MUCH CHOICE HERE SO WE'LL BE RIGHT BACK JUDICIARY COMMITTEE. OF WE HAVE HEARD TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. OF SB -- ONE FORTY TWO LACTATION ACCOMMODATIONS IT IS NOW TIME FOR THE OPPOSITION TO STEP FORWARD. AND WILL YOU BE TESTIFYING FOR ONE OR TWO TODAY. FOR TWO OKAY. ALL RIGHT AND AGAIN TWO MINUTES EACH GOOD AFTERNOON GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU SO MUCH CHAIRMAN AND OUR TERROR. AT MEMBER AND MEMBERS AS WELL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY HAS TO FIGHT TODAY. I'M MORE CURTIS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE ALREADY. SYMPATHETIC TO LACTATION ACCOMMODATION ISSUE AND SUPPORTED AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW LAST YEAR WHICH WAS LOW MOANS BILL. HOWEVER WE DO HAVE CONCERNS SPECIFICALLY WITH THIS -- WITH THE REQUIREMENTS LAID OUT N SB ONE FORTY TWO A LOT OF THESE ISSUES WERE NEGOTIATED ON LAST YEAR WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE -- WHEN SB -- WHEN AB NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WHEN INTO LAW THE? YES GOVERNOR GOVERNOR BROWN VETOED A MORE NARROW DOWN VERSION WHICH WAS SB NINE THIRTY SEVEN OF THIS BILL LAST YEAR. AND WE FEEL THAT HIS VETO MESSAGE IS STILL -- SHOULD STILL BE CONSIDERED HE SAID THAT NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX WAS PROVIDING THE REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION FOR LACTATION AND THAT -- SB NINE THIRTY SEVEN WAS NOT WAS NOT NECESSARY AND WE BELIEVE THAT THAT STILL HOLDS TRUE TODAY. I'M NOT ONLY DOES THIS BILL REQUIRE EXTREME BUILDING CODE REQUIREMENTS THAT WOULD COST BETWEEN THIRTY THOUSAND AND A HUNDRED AND FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN EMPLOYER -- AS WELL AS FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR AND MEANS TO FOURTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR MAINTENANCE IT ALSO IS UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATIVE OF PROTECTIONS ARE ALREADY PROVIDED UNDER THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING LAW. WITH REGARD -- TO RECORD DISCRIMINATION AND RETALIATION FOR LACTATION LACTATING MOTHERS. AND THE CONCERN THERE IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING RT REGULATES LACTATION -- RETALIATION IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING ACT AND THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR TO ESSENTIALLY -- DIFFERENT PREPARED DIFFERENT ADMINISTRATIVE -- AUTHORITY ON THIS SO THE LABOR COMMISSIONER COULD COME OUT WITH THEIR OWN AUTHORITY ON THIS AS WELL AS THE DEPARTMENT OF FAIR EMPLOYMENT HOUSING AND EMPLOYERS WOULD NOT KNOW WHICH ONE THEY NEED TO FOLLOW. ADDITIONALLY IT EXPANDS EMPLOYER CIVIL LIABILITY AND THERE'S ALSO TECHNICAL ISSUES WITHIN THE BILL THAT MEET YOUR AMENDMENTS ARE HELPING TO REMEDY BUT NOT ALL OF THEM WILL BE REMEDIED BY THIS. THAT ESSENTIALLY SAID EMPLOYERS UP FOR AUTOMATIC FAILURE FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL STATES THAT IT MUST BE IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO RUNNING WATER HOWEVER AND PRIOR. FOR HIRE -- SUBDIVISIONS OF THE BILL IT SAYS THAT A BATHROOM CANNOT BE USED AS AN ACCOMMODATION SO WHETHER THAT RUNNING WATER CAN BE USED IN THE BATHROOM. IS A CONCERN AS WELL AS THE FREE TALK SIXES AND HAZARDOUS MATERIALS I DO UNDERSTAND THE AUTHOR'S TAKING. AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS THAT ISSUE -- BUT ALSO THERE IS THE BREAK ROOM REQUIREMENT WHERE EMPLOYERS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A REASONABLE PLACE FOR BREAKS AND IF THAT SPACES UTILIZED AS A LACTATION ACCOMMODATION THE LACTATION ACCOMMODATION MUST TAKE PRECEDENCE. AND THEN EMPLOYEES WOULD BE OUT OF A PLACE AT FOR A REASONABLE BREAKS FOR THOSE REASONS WE ARE POST THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW YOU CAN TAKE A BREATH COULD YOU. ALMOST TWO MINUTES VERY THANK YOU CAN I ADD JUST A FEW QUICK POINTS MADAM CHAIR VERY QUICKLY ONE IS -- WE DO APPRECIATE THE AUTHORS ELIMINATION OF THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT IS IT YOU WANT. TO BUT BUT WE ARE AS YOU KNOW WELL MADAM CHAIR -- THE BILL AMENDS THREE LABOR CODE PROVISIONS AND ADDS TWO NEW SECTIONS WHICH OF COURSE CREATES POTENTIAL LIABILITY. UNDER THE PRIVATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL ACT. WE GO ANY FURTHER FOR THOSE WHO MIGHT BE LISTENING AND FOR THE RECORD YOU HAVE TO STATE YOUR SORRY MANAGER KRISTA KAYLEE -- CALIFORNIA AMBULANCE ASSOCIATION THE SECOND ITEM IS IS THAT IN LABOR CODE SECTION TEN THIRTY ONE THAT THE BILL AMENDS RELATED TO LOCATION. WE'D LIKE TO SEE A BROADER UNDUE HARDSHIP EXEMPTION TODAY IT'S LIMITED TO THOSE WITH FIFTY OR FEWER EMPLOYEES. THE THIRD IS IN THE NEW TEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH CREATES REQUIRES THE DEAL AS C. TO CREATE A MODEL POLICY. ALTHOUGH THE LANGUAGE SAYS SOMETHING ALONG THE LINES OF COMPLIANCE WITH IT IS NOT DEEMED A VIOLATION WE'D LIKE TO SEE. GOOD FAITH RELIANCE DEFENSE MADE CLEAR IN THAT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THAT A MODEL ACT AND THEN LASTLY JUST A GENERAL POINT -- THE AUTHOR HIS PATTERN THIS AFTER A SAN FRANCISCO ORDINANCE WHICH IS NOT BEEN IN EFFECT TOO LONG AND WE'D LIKE TO SEE IT PLAY OUT FOR A LITTLE WHILE LONGER. BEFORE WE TAKE THESE PROVISIONS STATEWIDE THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD NAME AFFILIATION AND SIMPLE YOUR OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ERIC PARKER THE CALIFORNIA SCHOOL BOARDS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION OF A WAS PRIMARILY BASED ON THE PRIVATE RIGHT -- WORK A RIGHT SO IF I CAN SAY THAT I'M A RIGHT OF ACTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. WE APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS AND SO WE'RE GONNA BE REEVALUATING OUR POSITION ON THE BILL BUT THAT WAS THE PRIMARY CONCERN WE STILL HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE CONSTRUCTION COSTS ISSUES BUT WILL BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS. GOOD AFTERNOON KATIE HAD SOME OF THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION REPOSE FOR THE REASONS PREVIOUSLY STATED. THANK YOU. HI SEAN LEWIS OF NATIONAL FEDERATION OF IN A BUSINESS REPRESENTING MALL BUSINESS OWNERS ALSO POSED FOR THE COST IN LITIGATION CONCERNS THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] ALL RIGHT. FIGURE BACK TO THE DíAS OTHER ANY QUESTIONS. BY A COUPLE COMMENTS -- SO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS OUT I'M A LITTLE DISAPPOINTED BECAUSE RIGHTS WITHOUT REMEDIES ARE NO RIGHTS AT ALL -- BUT HOPEFULLY THE FE H. ANY OTHER RELEVANT AGENCIES WILL BE ABLE. TO MAKE SURE THAT IF THIS DOES PASS THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN ENFORCE. WHEN WOMEN ARE LACTATING A LITTLE BY WOULD SUSPECT IT'S BEEN AWHILE FOR ME BUT I DID HAVE THAT EXPERIENCE UNLIKE? SENATOR WINNER BUT I'M SURE YOU'VE TALKED TO A NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN THROUGH THAT EXPERIENCE. YOU HAVE A LOT ON YOUR MIND OTHER THAN GOING AHEAD AND TRYING -- TO IN -- IMPLORE AN EMPLOYER TO ALLOW YOU TO BE ABLE TO EXPRESS MILK -- THE NOTION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE TO BE FIGHTING FOR THIS. UP RIGHT. I IS STILL QUITE EXTRAORDINARY EVEN IN TWENTY NINETEEN FOR SO MANY WOMEN ARE IN FACT WORKING WHERE WE KNOW THE BENEFITS OF BREASTMILK FOR CHILD'S WELL BEING WE KNOW THE BENEFITS TO THE MOTHER TO BE ABLE TO BREATH -- BREAST FEED -- I JUST A I I STILL FIND IT JUST ENCOURAGES IN I'M INCREDULOUS THAT E STILL KEP GETTING THIS KIND OF RESISTANCE. WOMEN ARE IN THE WORK FORCE. AND WE WANT WOMEN TO AND FAMILIES TO PROCREATE BECAUSE OTHERWISE THE SPECIES DIES. AND THESE ARE SORT OF FUNDAMENTAL NATURAL PROCESS SEES AN OF WOMEN ARE GOING TO BE WORKING. AND WANTING AND NEEDING AN BEING ENTITLED TO DO THIS -- I THINK WE CAN ALL FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE IT WORK. YOU KNOW WE PUT A MAN ON THE MOON IN LESS THAN A DECADE I THINK WE CAN FIGURE OUT HOW TO FIND AREAS SO THAT WOMEN CAN IN PRIVACY. AND WITH GOOD HYGIENE EXPRESS MAIL FOR THEIR BABIES -- SO. I AM GOING -- TO SUPPORT THIS BILL I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE TO BE A CO AUTHOR THE BILL. ON BEHALF OF THE YOUNGER WOMEN WERE STILL IN THOSE CHILDBEARING YEARS -- AND WOULD LIKE THE TO THE RIGHT TO IN THE OPPORTUNITY IN. THE THE THE RESPECT OF BEING ABLE TO EXPRESS MAIL FOR THEIR BABIES WHILE THEY WORK AS WELL SO THANK YOU AND SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRMAN I THINK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. JUST SO I'M CLEAR. THIS ADDRESSES. FUTURE NEW BUILDING CONSTRUCTION AND REMODELS IT DOESN'T REQUIRE EXISTING OFFICES. TO PROVIDE THIS ACCOMMODATION NO IT REQUIRES BOTH SIR FOR EXISTING OFFICES-- THEY HAVE WOULDHAVE TO DEDICATE SPACE BUT THE BILL PROVIDES EXTRAORDINARY FLEXIBILITY -- YOU YOU DON'T THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO SOME SORT OF RENOVATION THEIR HEARTS OF PROVISIONS PARTICULARLY FOR SMALLER BUSINESSES. THERE ARE PROVISIONS WERE -- COLOCATED OFFICES OUR WORKPLACES CAN SHARE -- AND SO WE WOULD YOU CAN HAVE A TEMPORARY THERE MIGHT BE IF YOU WERE SPACE IT DOESN'T HAVE. A PRIVATE ROOM YOU COULD -- CREATE TEMPORARY PARTITION THAT GETS PUT UP AND TAKEN DOWN. ON AND THEN WE HAVE SPECIAL -- PROVISIONS FOR THE AGRICULTURE -- AND CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRIES BECAUSE EVER UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES -- SO LET THE LAST YEAR. WE WENT WE WORKED. INTENSIVELY WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY -- INCLUDING WITH THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE BUT WITH SPECIFIC INDUSTRIES AND WE TOOK A MANY MANY AMENDMENTS LAST YEAR. TO CREATE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND WE WORK COLLABORATIVELY COLLABORATIVELY TOGETHER -- DAY THE NEW CONSTRUCTION PIECE AS THE BUILDING CODE CHANGE -- AND THAT IS -- FOR WHEN THEY ARE IF YOU'RE BUILDING OR RENOVATING ABOVE A CERTAIN SQUARE FOOTAGE. YOU HAVE TO PLAN FOR IT -- THE ONLYDIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE THE COMMITTEE TODAY -- AND WHAT WAS VETOED LAST YEAR IS THE BUILDING CORPORATE SENATOR SMALL MINOR TECHNICALS -- DIFFERENCES BUT THAT WAS NOT IN THE BILL THAT WAS VETOED IT WAS TAKEN OUT IN THE COURSE OF LEGISLATION LAST YEAR AS WAS DEPRIVE RIGHT OF ACTION. WITH BOTH OF THOSE BACK IN BECAUSE I BELIEVE IN THEM -- THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS NOW OUT AGAIN -- BUT THE BUILDING CODE IS STILL AN BUT EVERYTHING ELSE AND I WAS A LITTLE CONFUSED BY THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE IT -- IT'S NOT THE CASE THAT THIS IS SOMETHING TOTALLY DIFFERENT BILL OTHER THAN HAVING THE BUILDING CODE THANK YOU FOR THE CLARIFICATION IN. MADAM CHAIR MADE REFERENCE TO A MAN ON THE MOON WITH THIS PROVIDE ACCOMMODATION FOR FEMALE ASTRONAUT SIR IS THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW ONLY. WELL THAT MIGHT READ MEET RESISTANCE FROM THE SAME OPPONENTS HERE BUT HOPEFULLY BY THAT TIME. WE WILL HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT OF DAY THAT THIS IS NOT THAT DIFFICULT IT'S JUST A QUESTION OF PRIORITIZING WOULD HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH NASA ON THAT ONE I THINK IT'S TRUE IS NASA STILL IN EFFECT AND AT ANY RATE -- THANK YOU AND QUESTION CENTER WHITE CASKET. THE I THINK THE TRIGGER ON THE REMODEL IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS CAN YOU GIVE ME THE BENEFIT OF YOUR THINKING ON DAD SINCE MY WIFE AND I JUST REMODELED OUR HOUSE ACROSS IS A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS. SO MY CONCERN IS THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN OFFICE BUILDING IS. I AM JUST TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOU'RE THINKING AS YOU KNOW I THINK WE THE TERM WHICH WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS BALANCE THAT THERE IS THERE IS A COST INVOLVED -- AND SO THERE'S A CERTAIN -- A THRESHOLD AND ONE COULD ARGUE IT SHOULD BE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND AND I'M LOOKING IS A MAGIC NUMBER -- BUT WE THOUGHT THAT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND IS A SIGNIFICANT IN OFFICE -- RENOVATION THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE TO DO AND AGAIN IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT LIKE A MONUMENTAL. THING THAT HAS TO BE BUILT INTO IT IT'S JUST. WHILE YOU'RE DOING -- NEARLY COULD YOU DON'T HAVE A ROOM THAT HAS -- A POWER OUTLET IN THAT MAY PUT ONE AND IT'S FOR THE REQUIREMENTS IS BILL. ARE ARE QUITE BASIC IN TERMS OF A TABLE OR CHAIR. AND NEARBY RUNNING WATER WHICH COULD BE A SINK NOT EVEN A FULL BATHROOM NEARBY RUNNING WATER NEARBY. REFRIGERATOR WHICH COULD BE A SMALL LITTLE MINI FRIDGE -- SERVICE AND PRIVACY SO YOU THIS IS NOT. A COMPLICATED. SITUATION. NO NO IN FACT SOME ARE YOU MENTIONED A PARTITION YOU HAVE A BREAK FROM YOU CAN WHAT IS BECAUSE HUNDRED DOLLARS TO GET A PARTITION. PUT IN A PARTITION WILL SIGN THAT SAYS PLEASE DO NOT DISTURB. I MEAN THIS THIS IS NOT THE ROCKET SCIENCE TO PUT A A WOMAN ON THE MOON -- ONE BUT I DID I DID HAVE A QUESTION I WAS A LITTLE CONCERNED AND I REALIZE THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO MAKE THESE ACCOMMODATIONS FOR BUSINESSES AND I APPRECIATE THAT -- BUT IN THE AGRICULTURAL CONTEXT I NOTE THAT THERE THERE'S AN OFFER THAT EVEN A THE LACTATION COULD BE OFFERED IN A TRUCK CAB REALLY. YEAH I CAN ADDRESSES OF THAT ACTUALLY WAS -- TAKEN LAST YEAR FROM AMONG THE BILL THAT IS CURRENT LAW UNDER THE BILL THAT WAS SIGNED LAST YEAR BY THE GOVERNOR -- AND NOW WAS NEGOTIATED WITH THE LIMO AND OFFICE AND AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY I DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHO IT WAS -- BUT IT JUST STATES THAT THAT IS COMPLEX. OFFERING THAT IS COMPLAIN BUT THERE CAN BE OTHER WAYS OFFER THAT THE AG INDUSTRY I KNOW. THE CALIFORNIA BREASTFEEDING COLLISIONS ON A LOT OF WORK THERE YES -- ONE OF THE THINGS THEY'VE DEVELOPED OR THESE -- IT COULD BE A TRUCK BUT IT COULD ACTUALLY BE THEY HAVE THESE TENTS THESE. TENTS THAT HAVE. THE ARE. AERATED AND HAVE GOOD VENTILATION AND HAVE A PLACE FOR THE MOM TO ACTUALLY SIT. I I DON'T LIKE TO USE THE EXAMPLE BUT I WILL IT'S KIND OF LIKE A FORTY PA A PORT A POTTY THAT IT'S FAN IT LOOKS LKE THERE'S NO TOILET IN THERE. IT'S A PLACE FOR THE MOTHER TO SET. IT HAS A LITTLE AREA OF A TABLE FOR HER AND THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A LOOK TRICKLE OUT OUTLETS. SO THAT SHE CAN SIT IN THERE AND PUMP IT IT'S GIVING HER PRIVACY AND THAT IS WORKING AND THEY'VE ACTUALLY DEVELOP THAT AND WORKED IN CONJUNCTION WITH A LOT OF THE AGRICULTURAL INDUSTRY TO HAVE THESE. WHICH IS GREAT. WELL AND AND I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT BECAUSE THE NOTION THAT SOMEONE'S GOING TO GO INTO THE CAB. OF A TRUCK IN EXPRESSED MILK IS JUST IT'S A VISUAL THAT I'M JUST HAVING TROUBLE. WRAPPING MY HEAD AROUND WE ARE -- VENTURE WHICH WERE NAVIGATING THE FACT THAT THERE WAS A LAW THAT WAS SIGNED UNDER LAST YEAR WERE NOT LOOKING TO MESS WITH THAT BILL AND AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER ALONE IS BEEN VERY COLLABORATIVE AND IS A CO AUTHOR OF THIS YES. YES I NOTED THAT ALL RIGHT WELL. THANK YOU IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE IT IS OUR MOTION. ARE WE HAVE A MOTION IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE THE QUESTIONABLE. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO SENATE HOUSING. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL JACKSON HI JACKSON HI PORGES [inaudible] ALAN CABALLERO. MONNING. MONEY AYE STERN.

AND AGAIN WITNESSES TWO MINUTES A TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. AND THE SAME GOES FOR ANY OPPOSITION SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO BEGIN SENATOR HUESO THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU AND THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SB TWO OH EIGHT THE CONSUMER CALL PROTECTION ACT. I'D LIKE TO BEGIN -- BY ALL EXCEPT IN THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS. THIS IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION BILL. THAT IS INTENDED TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIANS CAN HAVE CONFIDENCE. IN THEIR TELL THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. WHEN I HEARD THAT BY 202040% OF EVERY CALL MADE TO YOUR TELEPHONE? IS GONNA BE A ROBO CALL OR A FAKE CALL ALSO KNOWN AS SPOOFING. I SAID WE HAVE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT AND I LEARNED THAT THERE ARE WAYS THAT WE CAN. ENSURE THAT THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN OR GROUP LARGE GREATLY REDUCE. THOSE PERCENTAGES IN THOSE INCIDENCES I'VE. LAST COMMITTEE I I'VE I REMINDED MEMBERS AT THIS CAN BE DONE. THAT CANADA THIS MONTH IS TAKING ACTION TO IMPLEMENT A VERY -- COMPREHENSIVE PROGRAM AND IN THEIR COUNTRY. WE CAN DO IT IN OUR STATE. AND I BELIEVE OF CALIFORNIA TAKES ACTION THE REST OF THE COUNTRY WILL FOLLOW ON THIS VERY. IMPORTANT ISSUE. THANK YOU IN AND BEFORE YOU GO FORWARD AS FOR THE MEMBERS I UNDERSTAND YOU ARE ACCEPTING THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ON PAG. FIVE INCOMING THREE THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE OF THOSE AMENDMENTS BECAUSE IT DOES -- BASICALLY STATE WITH THE LAW ALREADY IS AND WE WE NEEDED TO PUT IT INTO THE BILL BECAUSE OF COURSE -- YOU KNOW THE OPPOSITION IS GONNA. TRY -- TO MISINFORM THAT'S WHAT HAPPENED -- THIS BILL DOES NOT REQUIRE CLICK CALL BLOCKING IN AND WOULD NOT RESULT IN LEGITIMATE CALLS BEING BLOCKED. AND THAT IS ALREADY A REQUIREMENT UNDER UNDER THE LOSS BUT OUR WE'RE WE'RE GLAD TO RESTATE THAT BECAUSE THERE WERE SOME CONCERN MEANT -- EXPRESSED BY MEMBERS OF THE LAST COMMITTEE. AND WE DON'T WANT TO MISLEAD ANYBODY ABOUT WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT SO -- THIS BILL SAYS A DIET DEADLINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF A CALLER ID. AUTHENTICATION -- SYSTEM THAT IS -- NEEDED TO IDENTIFY ILLEGAL ROBOCALLS TO PREVENT HARM TO CONSUMERS AND ALSO THIS BILL ALSO NARROWLY ALLOWS A SI PC TO WORK WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO SUPPORT ACTION AGAINST. ILLEGAL WROBEL CALLER SO WE'RE PUTTING IN AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION THEIR AND THEIR INVOLVEMENT IS ONLY TO ENSURE [inaudible] THAT -- WE BRING UP PEOPLE THAT ARE ENGAGED IN ILLEGAL ACTIVITY TO JUSTICE. SO -- I WANTED TO ASK OF FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE AND OPEN UP TO QUESTIONS VERY GOOD TO HAVE ANY WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT TWO MINUTES PLEASE. HELLO THANK YOU COULD TEAR JACKSON AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS VINCENT LAY -- SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE -- WE FOCUS ON ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT FOR PEOPLE OF COLOR. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT BECAUSE ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT REQUIRES PROTECTING VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES FROM ECONOMIC HARM -- THERE WAS A RECORD FIVE BILLION RUBLE CALLS IN MARCH ALONE AND NEARLY HALF OF THOSE WERE ILLEGAL SCAMS AND FRAUD. YOU KNOW IN THESE ANY SCAMS CALLERS ARE POSING AS IRS AGENTS TO STEAL BANK INFORMATION -- THEY'RE POSING AS COUNTY WORKERS TO STEAL AND CAL FRESH RECIPIENTS EBT BENEFITS SO THEY CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO BUY FOOD FOR THEIR FAMILIES -- SEVENTY THE FTC ESTIMATES 70% OF THE FRAUD -- ORIGINATED PHONE SCAMS COSTING US NEARLY A BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. AND THE MOST TARGET IN THE MOST HARMED BY ALL OF THIS OUR SENIORS AND PEOPLE OF COLOR. AFRICAN AMERICANS AND LATINOS ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE DEFRAUDED BY THESE -- THE SCAMMERS AND THREE TIMES AS LIKELY TO FALL VICTIM TO DEBT FRAUD. NOT ONLY DOES IT ZERO TRUST IN THE PHONE SYSTEM -- EXPOSES THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS TO SCAMMERS AND PREDATORY BUSINESSES. THAT'S WHAT WE ASK YOU TO SUPPORT CALIFORNIANS -- AND VOTE I IS THAT VOTE I ON THIS BILL THANK YOU. VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KARAGIAS SANDERS FROM THE PUBLIC ADVOCATE'S OFFICE FORMALLY THE OFFICER REPAIR ADVOCATES OFFICE. WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SB -- TWO EIGHT MEMBER SPEAKING SPENDING IS INCREASINGLY BECOMING PROBLEM PROBLEMATIC BECAUSE BAD ACTORS ARE DISGUISING THEIR IDENTITY TO MAKE IT MORE LIKELY THAT THE CALL PERSON WILL PICK UP THE PHONE AND POTENTIALLY FALL FOR THE CLAIM THAT THEIR FALL FOR THE SCAM -- THIS BILL SIMPLY REQUIRES TELECOMMUNICATION PROVIDERS TO IMPLEMENT EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES TO VERIFY CALLERS IDENTITY. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WILL HELP PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM SCAMS DECEPTIVEMARKETING PRACTICES AND OTHER ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES I THINK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF THEIR OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. YOU CAN COME FORWARD IF YOU LIKE. WE HAVE PLACE FOR TWO PEOPLE THANK [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. MADAM CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS CAROLINE MCINTYRE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS ASSOCIATION -- WE ARE HERE WITH THE POSITION OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED. TO THE BILL -- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT THE BILL REFERENCES THAT SHAKEN AND STARE. IS ACTUALLY A TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS -- THAT THAT MEMBERS OF MY ASSOCIATION HAVE BEEN ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN TRYING TO AUTHENTICATE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO USE. THE TECHNOLOGY IN ORDER. TO DEAL WITH THE ROBO CALL AND THE GIVES ME AND THAT'S PUTTING PROBLEM WE ALSO RECOGNIZE IT AS A MAJOR ISSUE THE FCC HAS IN FACT ORDERED THE INDUSTRY. TO MOVE TOWARDS AYE AYE IMPLEMENTING -- CALLER IDENTIFICATION ARE COLORED AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGY WE ARE CONCERNED HOWEVER THAT THE BILL REQUIRES US TO DO IT BY JULY ONE OF TWENTY TWENTY AND WE MAY NOT BE READY TO TAKE TECHNOLOGY ITSELF. MAY NOT BE READY -- WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED THAT THE BILL ADDS IN THE C. P. U. C. TO BECOME INVOLVED IN REGULATING IN THE SPACE OR WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I SHOULD SAY TO REGULATE WITH THE SPACE. FEDERAL LAW ALREADY GIVES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AUTHORIZATION TO ENFORCE THESE LAWS THE CALIFORNIA ATTORNEY GENERAL IS ALSO A PART OF A FORTY MEMBER. THE GENERAL TASK FORCE THAT IS WORKING WITH THE AGENCY IN ORDER. TO INSURE THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM SO WE ARE LOOKING FOR A TWO AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL -- ONE WOULD BE TO ELIMINATE THE ROLE OF THE P. C. WE BELIEVE THAT THAT ONLY ADDS ADDITIONAL RED TAPE TO THE PROCESS THAT IS THE NECESSARY. INTO WOULD BE TO PROVIDE THEM -- AT LIABILITY PROTECTION IN CASE WE ARE TO IMPLEMENT THE TECHNOLOGY AND WE END UP BLOCKING A CALL THAT WE SHOULD HAVE OTHERWISE THROUGH. AN EXAMPLE OF THAT WOULD BE A SCHOOL THAT IS LOOKING TO PROVIDE SOME SORT OF EMERGENCY ALERT TO PARENTS ABOUT SOMETHING ON CAMPUS. WE ARE UNABLE TO AUTHENTICATE THE NUMBER AND WE BLOCKED THE CALL. WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT LIABILITY THEN COMING BACK ON TO THE KERRIER. SO AS THE AS A SAD WE DON'T OBJECT TO THE TECHNOLOGY OR BEING REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH THE BELL JUST LIKE FROM AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH LITERATURE MEMBERS. ARE ALSO FOR CTIA THE WIRELESS ASSOCIATION. LET'S STIPULATE EVERYBODY HATES REBEL CALLS. OUR A COMPANIES HATE REBEL CALLS THEY BOUGHT THEIR SYSTEM PEOPLE CALL AND COMPLAIN SO -- SO IT'S NOT AS IF -- WE DON'T HAVE AN INCENTIVE TO TO GO AFTER THE BAD GUYS -- THE ISSUE IS BEING ADDRESSED EFFECTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AS THE ANALYSIS YOU KNOW I THINK I CURLY POINTS OUT. AND AS MISTER MCINTYRE INDICATE -- THERE ALSO AS INDICATED THERE ARE SOME AUTOMATED CALLS LIKE PHARMACY REMINDERS TRAVEL UPDATES OR SCHOOL NOTICES THAT CAN BE USEFUL SO WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL. THAT IT THIS SAYS THIS TECHNOLOGY IS NOT GOING TO BE AN EXACT SCIENCE -- IT IS AN ALGORITHM WHERE OF SAY OKAY IT APPEARS AS IF. THIS IS A ROBOT COLORIST CAM CALL IT TELLS. THE CUSTOMER SHOWS ABOUT THEIR PHONE THAT THIS IS PROBABLY A SCAM CALL -- AND THE CUSTOMER WILL THEN NOT TAKE THE CALL AND IS MS MCINTYRE INDICATED SOMETIMES THAT COULD POTENTIALLY CREATE A PROBLEM. WE ARE WORKING WITH A TECHNOLOGY CALLED STERN SHAKE AND THE WIRELESS INDUSTRY. HE IS ON TRACK -- TO IMPLEMENT THE TECHNOLOGY -- HOPEFULLY BY THE END OF THIS YEAR -- THERE ARE THIRD PARTIES INVOLVED IN THE PROCESS SO IT'S NOT AGAIN BUT WE HAVE TO DEPEND ON OTHER PEOPLE. IT WOULD CREATE A PATCHWORK OF STATE LAWS AND ENFORCEMENT ON A MATTER THAT IS A QUINTESSENTIAL FEDERAL ISSUE WIRELESS CARRIER SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THE IMPORTANT TASK AT HAND. IMPLEMENTING STURGE STERN SHAKEN NEITHER THE PVC NOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS A QUICK TO ENFORCE LAWS. DEALING WITH REBEL CALLS. WE DON'T BELIEVE SB TWELVE EIGHT WILL HASTEN THIS PROCESS -- I'VE BEEN TO BUT DIPLOMATIC APPROPRIATE UNNECESSARY AUTHENTICATION. WHAT WE THINK IT HAS A RISK OF DIVERTING ATTENTION AND FOCUS FROM THAT TASK AND ADD A LAYER OF P. UC REGULATION THAT IS OFTEN OBTUSE? AND WAS PROCEEDS ARE LIKE THE AND CERTAINLY IN THIS CASE UNNECESSARY FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE US BETWEEN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PLEASE STEP FORWARD WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. AM LIMITS ON BEHALF OF CONSOLIDATED COMMUNICATIONS IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL AND AS A SMALL TELEPHONE COMPANY WE'D RESPECTFULLY REQUEST A LONGER IMPLEMENTATION TAKE YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON RENDON PALOMINO ON BEHALF OF SPRING ALSO RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. BOTTOM CHAIR MEMBERS DOMINIC TOMORROW HER BEHALF OF FRONTIER COMMUNICATIONS ALSO IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. HEIDI PERSONALLY ON BEHALF OF VERIZON WE CONTINUE. TO ROBUSTLY ARAB SUPPORT THE INTENT OF THE BILL BUT MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE TODAY THANK YOU. MANAGER MEMBERS MEMORY WITH EIGHTEEN T. IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. APOLOGIES MADAME SHERATON GET UP HERE FAST ENOUGH BUT DANIEL TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK AND THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT ALRIGHT. ANYONE ELSE WITH THE AN OPINION. OKAY LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS ANYONE ON THE DíAS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR OPINIONS. SENATE AROUND. I JUST -- CAN I GET IT I THINK WE ALL ARE TOTALLY IN SUPPORT OF THE THE GOAL HERE AND LOVE THE HASHTAG. HI TELL US JUST A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT HOW YOU YOU'RE WORKING WITH ELDERLY FOR THIS TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE HAVE. TO AS THE WORK ON THE PLATFORMS THAT -- THAT ARE ARE IN QUESTION RIGHT AND SO HOW ARE WE WHAT'S YOUR SENSE OF THE CURRENT STATE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE FOLKS IN THE TELECOM INDUSTRY ABOUT HOW TO REALLY MAKE THIS WORK IN A WAY THAT IS BOTH FEASIBLE -- AND AND MEANINGFUL FOR CONSUMERS AND I MEET WITH THEM AT LEAST ONCE A WEEK -- TO DISCUSS ANY PROVISION OF THIS BILL AND AGAIN -- AND I'M OPEN -- TO THEIR IDEAS -- WE HAVE DISCUSSED THIS. AT LENGTH. AND I STILL FEEL IN ALL OUR CONVERSATIONS -- WE WE NEED AN AND MORE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM ON THE LAW THAT'S WHY I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS ON HOW WE ENFORCE BUT CURRENTLY. THE P. YOU SEE DEALS WITH TELECOMMUNICATIONS -- GENERALLY. AND THEY HAVE -- THE THE THE BEST WAY TO TO AT LEAST IDENTIFY. INSTANCES OF THIS AND WE'RE ALL WE'RE DOING THAT WE'RE NOT TASK IN THE P. YOU SEE. WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN TO WORK WITH THE STATE AND LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO SUPPORT. THE THE ENFORCEMENT OF THE EXISTING NOW CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS WITH IN CALIFORNIA THAT'S BASICALLY ALL WHAT WE'RE DOING WE'RE NOT GOING OUT THERE AND SAY YOU MUST. REGULATE WHAT THIS IS JUST AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO A TO BRING THOSE PEOPLE TO JUSTICE. THAT ARE ENGAGING IN THIS ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. BY NO MEANS AM I SAYING THAT THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS PROVIDERS. ARE ARE THE ONES THAT ARE ARE ARE DO ARE UP TO THE WRONG DOING AND I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE A BILL. THAT FINDS WAYS TO PUNISH THE INDUSTRY NOT AT ALL BUT WE HAVE FOUND A BETTER WAY TO DO THIS AND CANADA IS IS LEADING THE ROLE WHEN YOU SAY. ALL THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S TAKING ACTION FOR A GOVERNMENT HAS NOT TAKEN ACTION THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS NOT EVEN. BEGUN TO TAKE ACTION BUT ISSUED A WARNING TO THE INDUSTRY THAT IF THEY DON'T DO SOME ABOUT THIS THEY WILL TAKE ACTION. THAT THAT'S A WEEK. TAKING ACTION. THERE IS A WONDERFUL A DOCUMENTARY BY BY JOHN OLIVER -- I ENCOURAGE YOU TO WATCH THAT IT JUST REALLY GETS INTO THE DETAILS OF THIS MATTER AND IT HE'S BASICALLY CHALLENGING. LAWMAKERS ACROSS THE STATE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT BECAUSE THE SOLUTION IS AVAILABLE TO US NOW. WHY WE WHY WE HAVE MEMBERS IN THE INDUSTRY SAYING THAT IT'S NOT AND THEY CAN IMPLEMENTED BY THAT DATE? I DON'T KNOW WHY AREN'T THE WORKING ON IMPLEMENTING IT NOW WITHOUT OUR INVOLVEMENT I DON'T KNOW EITHER. IF 40% OF EVERY CALL BEEN ISSUED. A BEING BEING TRANSPARENT OUR PHONES. IS NOT SEEN AS AN ENORMOUS PROBLEM. I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE FOR US TO BEGIN TO WORK TO SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. IF I THOUGHT THAT THEY WERE JUST A AND AGAIN YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU CAN LOOK INTO THIS FOR YOURSELF IF I THOUGHT THAT THEY COULD NOT DO THIS. BY -- JULY OF TWENTY TWENTY YOU KNOW I WOULD NOT PLAY BUT HE'S SUCH A HARD DATE BUT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IS ALREADY OUT THERE AND THEY'VE EVEN COUNTED WHAT Y.. SHAKEN AND STIRS ARE ALREADY DEVELOPING BETTER TECHNOLOGIES AND SAKE SHAKEN SERVE WELL THAT'S IN THE BILL. SHAKEN -- SERVERS OR SOMETHING MORE EFFECTIVE. AND AGAIN OF I UNDERSTAND THAT. ANYTHING THAT REQUIRES THEM TO DO ANYTHING IS NOT SOMETHING THEY'LL AGREE TO IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCE EVEN IF IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S GOOD. YOU KNOW I JUST. I I I THEY'RE NOT OPPOSE I DON'T THINK THEY'RE OPPOSED TO TO DOING THIS THEY'RE JUST SUPPOSED TO HAVE BEEN A LAW. IN THE BOOKS THAT THEY SEE AS A LIABILITY TO THEM AND I UNDERSTAND THAT YOU KNOW IF. IF I WERE IN THEIR SHOES I'D PROBABLY DO THE SAME THING I I'M NOT CRITICIZING THEM AT ALL. BUT THAT THAT IS SOMETHING THAT THEY'LL THEY'LL HAVE TO DEAL WITH. IT IN. FOR US TO BASICALLY ACHIEVE SOME LEVEL OF SANITY. IN OUR IN OUR PHONE SYSTEM THIS IS A MAJOR ISSUE WHEN PEOPLE START TO IGNORE PHONE CALLS AT THE RECEIVING. OR REQUEST WERE IGNORING CALLS. FROM -- LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THEIR SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY HAVE OVER THERE FREIGHTED IT. IT JUST CREATES THIS THIS CHAOS AND OUR PHONE SYSTEM IT'S LITTERED WITH UNCERTAINTY IT REDUCES THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN A TECHNOLOGY THAT. HE IS IS ONE OF THE IS BECOMING ONE OF THEIR LARGEST MONTHLY BILLS. AND I JUST THINK WE CAN DO. SOMETHING BETTER IN CALIFORNIA IF CANADA IS DOING THE-SUCCESSFULLY WHY CAN'T WE TRY. BUT CERTAINLY THE LARGEST MONTHLY BILLS WOULD MEAN WELL OF THE YOUR YOUR LEFT CELL PHONE BILLS ARE ARE PRETTY LARGE. CELL PHONE BILLS ARE BECOMING VERY VERY BIG BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE ARE ARE CONDUCTING THEIR RIGHT OKAY BUSINESS. ON PHONES -- A PHONE IS NOT JUST A PHONE ANYMORE IT'S YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S A C. P. U. OF OUR LIVES. AND AND IT'S BECOME ALMOST ESSENTIAL TO EVERYBODY'S. DAILY LIVES AND AND HAVING 40% OF EVERY I JUST CAN'T GET OVER THAT NUMBER. WE CAN DO BETTER WE SHOULD TRY AND I'M OPEN TO SUGGESTIONS. BUT THE IDEA IS THIS CAN BE DONE WE SHOULD BE DOING THAT WE WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE QUESTIONS BUT I JUST LIKE TO DIRECT YOUR ATTENTION AND WE'LL GO TO SENATOR STERN. THERE WAS A SUGGESTION OF BY I FORGET WHAT PART OF THE INDUSTRY -- THAT THEY HAD TO CONCERNS ONE IS THEY DON'T REALLY LIKE THE P. YOU SEE DOING THIS AND I'M NOT SURE THIS ANYBODY IN THIS ROOM IS OVERWHELMINGLY DELIGHTED WITH THE WORK THAT. YOU SEE THESE DAYS WOULD YOU WOULD YOU CONSIDER OR OR A PLEDGE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH SOME ALTERNATIVE ON ENFORCEMENT. AND THEN ALSO ADDRESS AND I'D BE GLAD TO WORK WITH YOU AS WELL GREAT AND THEN THE SECOND ONE IS THE LIABILITY PROTECTION FOR IMPROPERLY BLOCKED CALLS WOULD YOU ALSO AGREE TO CONTINUE WORKING. ON ON THAT TO THE TO THAT THERE'S A LEGITIMATE CONCERN MIGHT NEED TO MEET. ANYBODY THE BILL PERFECT I THOUGHT THERE WAS A REAL LIABILITY OF THEM BLOCKING CALLS THIS BILL DOES NOT ADDRESS BLOCKING AND THAT'S AGAIN OKAY THEIR MESSAGE JEAN. IS IS IS I UNDERSTAND TO CONFUSE AND SO IF THAT'S SO THEN THAT ISN'T AN ISSUE BUT I THINK THOSE WERE. TO IT WAS CONSIDERED CONCERNS THAT DIDN'T SEEM TO HAVE I THINK SOME RESIDENTS HERE AND IF YOU KEEP WORKING ON THAT THAT'S ALL THAT'S ALL I'D ASK A WORKING SOLVE IN ANY PART OF THE BILL. BUT I WON'T WORK ON SOLVING A PROBLEM THAT DOESN'T EXIST I THAT SENATOR STERN MANAGER MAYBE JUST BUILDING ON THAT. WHAT WHAT ARE THE LIGHT WHAT WOULD THEY BE LIABLE WHAT WITH THE TELL BECAUSE BE LIABLE FOR UNDER THIS LIKE HOW HOW DO HOW DOES THE ENFORCEMENT WORKERS I'M SEEING? I'M LOOKING THROUGH THE ANALYSIS IT'S AUTHORIZING. THE AG TO PROSECUTE ACTIONS FOR VIOLATIONS AND THEN THERE'S HANDLE TEAS. SO THE THE ENFORCEABLE COME FROM P. YOU SEE AND THE AG OR FOR THE P. YOU SEE WOULD GATHER THE AG WOULD ENFORCEAND WHAT WE TRY. TO TRIGGER THAT ENFORCEMENTCAN YOU NOW AGAIN THE BILL ALL THE BILL DOES IS REQUIRE THEM. TO CREATE A CALLER IDENTIFICATION AUTHENTICATION SYSTEM. THAT. IT DOESN'T SAY. THAT IT HAS TO AFFECTED REALLY BLOCK EVERY SINGLE CALL DOESN'T SAY THAT BUT IT IS THAT -- SHAKEN STIRS IS IS TO FIND. AND IT IT'S ALREADY -- THEY'LL EVEN SAY WERE WERE USING SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS ALREADY -- AND AND SOME ARE AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS CHICKEN SISTERS AS A CALLER I. AUTHENTICATION PROTOCOL THAT USES COMPUTER PRAG PROGRAMMING. TO DETERMINE IF THE CALLER HAS BEEN SPOOFED THE PROGRAM IN THE PROGRAMMING IS EMBEDDED INTO TELECOMMUNICATION NETWORK CONTROLS. AND USES INFORMATION ABOUT THE CALL TO DETERMINE THE DEGREE TO WHICH THE CALL IS LIKELY SPOOFED. THE SOFTWARE CAN DETERMINE THE FOLLOWING. THE CALLER ID IS FULLY VERIFIED -- A FREQUENTLY WHEN THE CALLER HAS A CALLER ID IT IS REGISTERED WITH THE A CARRIER FROM WHICH IT IS PLACING THE CALL -- THE SOURCE OF THE CALL IS IDENTIFIED. BUT IT IS NOT KNOWN TO WITH THE CALLER IS AUTHORIZED TO USE A CALLER ID SO FREQUENTLY. THIS OCCURS WHEN BUSINESSES HAVE MANY INTERNET PHONE LINE TO SHARE THE SAME TELECOM TRUNK FOR OUTBOUND CALLS. THE THE PROBE IT GOES ON TO KIND OF DESCRIBE. THAT. ARE THERE IT THERE IS A SYSTEM FOR TRYING TO SEPARATE CALLS THAT HAVE BEEN DIGITIZED AND BETTER. SO. THE TECHNOLOGY EXISTS FOR SURE AND ALL THE BILL REQUIRE. IS THAT THEY IMPLEMENT THIS TECHNOLOGY. SIMPLE SO THEY'D BE THEY'D BE LIABLE. WOULD IF THEY DIDN'T TAKE A SHOT AT IMPLEMENTING IT RIGHT THEY'RE NOT LIABLE IF IT'S BASED ON THE EFFICACY OF THAT TECHNOLOGY IT'S NOT IF IT'S PERFECT OR LESS THAN. IT'S IT'S ART ARE THEY PUTTING FORWARD. A PLAN THAT'S A 100% CORRECT OKAY. THANKS. THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS COMMENTS. CENTER I'M SURE DID YOU HAVE ONE CENTER BUT NO OKAY. ALL RIGHT -- IS OUR MOTION.

THIS AYE YOU'VE BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY FILE ITEM SIX IT IS ALWAYS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE SB TWO TWENTY TWO MADAM CHAIR IS A RE INTRODUCTION OF SB. ONE FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN FROM LAST YEAR WHICH PASSES COMMITTEE AND FALL AND FULL LEGISLATURE WITH BROAD BIPARTISAN SUPPORT IN FACT. SEVEN OF THESE COMMIT CURRENT COMMITTEE MEMBERS HAVE VOTED FOR IT PREVIOUSLY SB TWO TWENTY TWO WOULD PROTECT VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. AND ENSURE THAT LANDLORDS CANNOT DENY HOMELESS VETERANS HOUSING BASED SOLELY. ON THE FACT THAT THEY RECEIVE A RENTAL ASSISTANCE VOUCHERS. US VETERANS IN THOSE CURRENTLY SERVING IN THE ARMED FORCES ARE PROTECTED FROM EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION. BY THE CALIFORNIA FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT HOWEVER THE LAW DOES NOT SPECIFICALLY INCLUDE. VETERANS OR MILITARY PERSONNEL AMONG THOSE WHO ARE PROTECTED FROM HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. ALMOST EVERY OTHER PROTECTED CLASS IN THE FAIR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING ACT IS PROTECTED IN BOTH EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING DISCRIMINATION STATUTES. SB TWO TWENTY TWO WOULD ADDRESS THIS GAP BY ADDING VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL AS A PROTECTED CLASS IN STATUTES RELATING TO HOUSING DISCRIMINATION. THE BILL WILL ALSO ENSURE OUR HEROES ARE NOT DISCRIMINATED AGAINST IN HOUSING AND ARE NOT DENIED HOUSING BECAUSE OF HOW THEY PAY THEIR RENT. OUR VETERANS AND MILITARY PERSONNEL ALREADY FACE SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CHALLENGES THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING DISCRIMINATED AGAINST WHEN TRYING TO FIND A HOME. FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I HAVE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IF YOU COULD GIVE US A TWO MINUTE PRESENTATION. THANK YOU.

SENATOR HILL THAT A VERY GOOD JOB OF MAKING THE CASE -- CABS A IS A VETERANS SERVICE ORGANIZATION THAT FOCUSES ON SERVING THAT'S IN THE AREAS OF HOMELESSNESS MENTAL HEALTH AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT -- IN ADDITION TO MAKING THE CASE THERE'S ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE THAT VETERANS ARE DISCRIMINATED AGAINST -- HOWEVER -- THE WASHINGTON ATTORNEY GENERAL BOB FERGUSON DID A STING TO EVALUATE WHETHER NOT THIS WAS ACTUALLY HAPPENING IN THAT STING THEY I EMAILED FIFTY RANDOM LANDLORDS ASKING THEM. IF THEY COULD USE A HIDE BASH VOUCHER FOR THE PURPOSES OF HOUSING AND TEN RESPONDED -- JUST WITH THE BLANKET WE DON'T ACCEPT THOSE -- IT -- IS HAPPENING IN ADDITION THE URBAN INSTITUTE DID A FIVE CITY PILOT -- STUDY -- FUNDED BY THE US DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT AND FOUND ABOUT YOUR AFFORDABLE HOUSING LANDLORDS THAT SAY YES CAN BE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING IN LOS ANGELES THE STUDY FOUND. THAT 76% OF LOS ANGELES LANDLORDS REFUSED TO ACCEPT WE HOPE YOU'LL PASS THIS VERY VALUABLE BILL TO PREVENT THIS DISCRIMINATION WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MADAM CHAIR MEMBER MIKE MATIC VICE PRESIDENT NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATIONS FOR THE BILL THANK YOU. SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF OF THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH DID YOU SPEAK TO MR A ALLEN ABOUT YOUR PRIOR SUPPORT ON THE BILL THAT HE WASN'T IN THE ROOM. THERE YOU GO JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU'RE ON TOP OF THOSE A CONSTITUENCY OR ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION [inaudible] GOOD AFTERNOON. A GOOD AFTERNOON SURE JACKSON MEMBERS -- CREAM THREE C. ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS -- HERE TODAY WHEN THE POST WAS AMENDED POSITION ON SB. TWO TWO TWO SB TWO TWO TWO IS A REINTRODUCTION OF SB. FOURTEEN TWENTY SEVEN WHICH WAS VETOED BY GOVERNOR BROWN LAST YEAR. THE FIRST COMPONENT OF THE BILL SEEKS TO AMEND THE CALIFORNIA FOR EMPLOYMENT AND HOUSING AT TO INCLUDE VETERAN OR MILITARY STATUS SEE OUR IS PERFECTLY FINE WITH THOSE PROVISIONS. HOWEVER THE SECOND COMPONENT OF THE BILL -- REDEFINED SOURCE OF INCOME TO INCLUDE SECTION EIGHT HUD BASH VOUCHERS -- THIS EFFECTIVELY REQUIRES ALL RENTAL PROPERTY OWNERS TO PARTICIPATE IN SECTION EIGHT UNDER HUD'S VETERAN AFFAIRS SUPPORTIVE HOUSING PROGRAM. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT SECTION IT WAS DESIGNED TO BE VOLUNTARY BECAUSE UNLIKE CASH VOUCHERS SECTION EIGHT ENTAILS EXTENSIVE COORDINATION WITH THE LOCAL HOUSING AUTHORITY. UNIT INSPECTIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS TO TAKE A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF TIME TO FULFILL WELL THE UNITS IT'S VACANT -- MOST NOTABLY SECTION A REQUIRES THE LANDLORD TO ENTER INTO A LEGALLY BINDING CONTRACT KNOWN AS A HOUSING ASSISTANCE PAYMENTS OR HAPPY CONTRACT. SB TWO TWO TWO REQUIRES ALL LANDLORDS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE SECTION EIGHT HUD BASH PROGRAMS BY FORCING THEM TO ENTER INTO A HAVE CONTRACT THE PROVISIONS OF WHICH THEY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO FILL. LAST YEAR SEE OUR WORK WITH THE LEGISLATURE ON AB TWENTY TWO NINETEEN TEN WHICH REQUIRES ALL LANDLORDS ACCEPT CASH VOUCHERS FROM THIRD PARTIES. HOWEVER THAT BILL EXCLUDED SECTION. EIGHT BECAUSE SECTION REQUIRES LANDLORDS TO CONTRACTUALLY ENTER INTO AN AGREEMENT AND SUBJECTS AND OTHER BURDENSOME STANDARDS. SEE OUR AGREES WITH FORMER GOVERNOR BROWN TO VETO MESSAGE THAT THE SECTION EIGHT HAD BASH PROGRAM SHOULD REMAIN VOLUNTARY AND AS A RESULT OPPOSES SB TWO TWO TWO UNTIL THE MANDATORY PARTICIPATION PROVISIONS ARE REMOVED FROM THE BILL. SEE OUR ENCOURAGES THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER ALTERNATIVE PROPOSALS. SUCH AS SB FIVE TWO ONE BY SENATOR PORTANTINO WHICH WOULD ESTABLISH A TAX CREDIT TO INCENTIVIZE MORE LANDLORDS TO VOLUNTARILY PARTICIPATE IN SECTION. EIGHT HOWEVER THIS TIME WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE ON SB TWO TWO TWO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEING AND HEARING NONE WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE DYESS SENATOR ON BURKE. OF THE THANK YOU SENATE BILL -- CENTER GLAZER HAS A BILL -- IT IS SB SIX FOUR FOUR IF YOU SPOKEN TO SENATOR GLAZER ABOUT IT IT IT SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE BOTH FOCUSED ON A SIMILAR ISSUE. I DON'T KNOW I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT IN AN OKAY WELL JUST A JUST A HEADS IDEA -- BUT WE'LL TALK WITH THEM. THANK YOU CENTER THANK YOU ANY OTHER. I JUST LIKE GO I JUST LIKE TO GET CONFIRMATION OF YOU KNOW THIS VOLUNTARY PROGRAM CLEARLY HASN'T WORKED -- AND THERE MAY BE OTHER WAYS AND AND SENATOR HILL YOU MIGHT. CHECK WITH THE SENDER PORTANTINO AND BUT BUT I I'M JUST CONCERNED. AS CERTAINLY WITH TO SAY THIS IS VOLUNTARY JUST ISN'T WORKING I THINK THIS THE STATISTICS ARE PRETTY OVERWHELMING. I WANT TO BE CLEAR THOUGH -- IN CENTERVILLE FEW WOULD CONFIRM THAT THIS BILL DOESN'T FORCE LANDLORDS TO ACCEPT THE V&lt;c.cyan&gt;OF&lt;/c&gt; ASH VOUCHER HOLDER JUST BECAUSE THE PERSON IS OF ASH. A VOUCHER HOLDER IN OTHER WORDS ALL THE OTHER REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE IN PLACE THERE ARE REASONS HAS A BAD CREDIT RATING OR ANY OTHER LAWFUL BASIS ANOTHER WOULD JUST DOESN'T PUT THEM -- GIVE THEM PRIORITY THIS JUST SAYS THEY HAVE A AND SEAT AT THE TABLE IF YOU WILL IF ALL THEIR OTHER -- VISIONS CONDITIONS ARE MET YES THAT'S ACTUALLY TRUE AND I THINK WE NEED TO PUT THIS IN PERSPECTIVE MADAM CHAIR. HERE IN THE REALTORS I I FIND IT ALMOST EMBARRASSING. OF THEIR OPPOSITION BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. ONE THOUSAND EIGHT HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO VOUCHERS IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA EIGHTEEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY TWO VETERANS WHO COULD FIND A HOME WITH THOSE VOUCHERS NOW THERE ARE FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND SECTION EIGHT VOUCHERS IN CALIFORNIA. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SUBSECTION OF SECTION EIGHT THAT APPLIES TO VETERANS AND IT DOESN'T JUST GIVE THEM A HOUSING VOUCHER GIVES OF OTHER SERVICES COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES THAT GO WITH THOSE VOUCHERS THAT THEY NEED -- AND IN ORDER FOR THEM TO GET THAT SO THAT'S FOR AND THERE ARE OVER SIX MILLION. RENTAL HOUSING UNITS. IN CALIFORNIA. SO THIS IS A EIGHT AND WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CHAMBER LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT ASSOCIATION WERE ACTUALLY RENT PROPERTY TO THEM REALTORS SELL PROPERTY THEY DON'T RENT PROPERTY. UP AND MAYBE SOME OF THEM DO BUT WE WORK WITH THE CHAMBER THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND THEY'VE ALL REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION. SO THANK YOU. US SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND JUST REAL BRIEFLY HAS THERE BEEN ANY. INDICATION OF AN INCREASE IN DISCRIMINATION AFTER THE RECENT GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN. IN A FEAR OF LANDLORDS PERHAPS THAT. VETERANS OR ACTIVE DUTY MILITARY WON'T BE ABLE. TO PAY THE RENT THE STUDIES WE'VE SEEN HAVE BEEN BEFORE PRIOR TO THAT TAT TIME MEAN TO ME THAT JUST ADDS TO THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS BILL IS IF THERE'S THE FEAR THAT. MILITARY PERSONNEL OR VETERANS ARE GONNA SOMEHOW. NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO PAY THE RENT BECAUSE OF NOW THE USE OF GOVERNMENT SHUT DOWN THE AS APPARENTLY IN NEW POLITICAL TACTIC SO. AGAIN I'M GLAD -- TO MOVE THE BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU FOR HANGING RIGHT. DID DID YOU HAVE A OMMENT IS AND I JUST WANTED AB ONE STAT THE 76% -- DISCRIMINATION THAT WE MENTION AMONG LOS ANGELES LANDLORDS IF YOU ACTUALLY -- SEGMENT BY THE POOREST NEIGHBORHOODS IT GOES UP 282% HAVE U. S. HOMELESS VETERANS ARE IN CALIFORNIA THE PROBLEM HERE IS MOST ACUTE THIS ADDS TO IT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OF WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR MINING CHICKEN WE ACCEPT THAT.

THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR YOU KNOW WHEN I LEARNED THAT -- WHO GENERALLY -- PEOPLE THAT THE LOW LOW INCOME FAMILIES OFTEN HAVE VERY VERY POOR CREDIT AND I ACTUALLY LEARNED THAT A GROWING PROBLEM IN OUR STATE. IS ON LATE LATE PAYMENTS TO MEDICAL BILLS ARE ACTUALLY RUINING. LOTS OF PEOPLE'S CREDIT. AND AND THIS IS A PROBLEM GROWING PROBLEM IN OUR STATE THAT -- PEOPLE LOW SOCIO ECONOMICS ARE ARE USUALLY. OUR SYSTEM MAKES AN EVEN BIGGER ECONOMIC VICTIMS AND THAT -- WHEN WHEN THEY TRY TO ACCESS CREDIT THEY'RE THEY'RE OFTEN? ONLY HAVE HIGH INTEREST OPTIONS. AND WHEN YOU HAVE BAD CREDIT WHAT OPTIONS DO YOU HAVE TO IMPROVE YOUR CREDIT THERE REALLY AREN'T ANY THE VERY FEW. AND SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE NEED TO BE WORKING ON IN THE STATE IS PATHWAYS TO HELP THESE FAMILIES. IMPROVE THEIR CREDIT THIS BILL SB SIX NINETEEN CREATES A PILOT PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE PROMISE ZONE INITIATIVE PROGRAM. TO ALLOW FAMILIES IN THOSE AREAS TO GET TO PARTICIPATE. IN A RENT REPORTING PROGRAM -- WHERE THEY CAN -- REPORT THEIR MONTHLY RENTAL PAYMENTS. AND WORKING IN CONJUNCTION WITH -- THE OWNERS OF THE APARTMENT STILL ESTABLISH A PROGRAM WHERE THEY WILL THEY WILL REPORT -- ON A MONTHLY BASIS TO ACT EQUIFAX AND ALL THE A CREDIT. AGENCIES SO THAT THIS WILL HELP PEOPLE IN THOSE AREAS ESTABLISH A CREDIT RATING THAT ALL I HELP THEM ACCESS CHEAPER LINES OF CREDIT SHOULD THE NEEDHAM -- IN THE FUTURE SO.

IN IN -- GETTING THE STATE INVOLVED IN AND SUPPORTING PROMISE OF AND THERE APPEARS TO BE NO OPPOSITION TO THE BILLAT THIS POINT LEAST NON WAS REGISTERED TO WHAT WE GO AHEAD WITH YOUR WITNESSES TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH. HORSE YOURS -- THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS -- MY NAME'S JESSICA US SOME COMMUNITY COMMUNITY ORGANIZER WITH MUTUAL HOUSING CALIFORNIA THE PORTABLE HOUSING NONPROFIT.

TRANSUNION AND EQUIFAX AND THIS PARTNERSHIP ONLY TOOK AS ABOUT THREE MONTHS -- TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT IN -- THREE OUT OF OUR NINETEEN COMMUNITIES. AND IT CAUSES ABOUT TWO HUNDRED A MONTH FOR ALL OF THESE THREE COMMUNITIES. AND PRIOR TO THIS PROGRAM 40% OF ALL OF OUR SEVENTY FIVE ENROLLEES DID NOT KNOW HOW TO CHECK THE CREDIT REPORT. AND SIXTY THREE POINT 5% DIDN'T EVEN KNOW THEIR CREDIT SCORE -- SO WE HAVE THIS PROGRAMMING TO SACRAMENTO COMMUNITIES AND ONE IN DAVIS. AND THROUGH THIS PARTNERSHIP OUR RESIDENT MEMBERS US HAVE SEEN AN IMMEDIATE BOOST IN THEIR CREDIT SCORE AFTER ROLLING INTO THE PROGRAM. AND THEY'VE BEEN. ABLE TO MONITOR THEIR SCORE -- SINCE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN WHEN WE STARTED THE PROGRAM. AND THE INITIAL DATA HAS SHOWN THAT THE AVERAGE CREDIT SCORE INCREASE BY FORTY POINT EIGHT YEAH FORTY POINTS AND ABOUT 11% WERE ABLE TO ESTABLISH CREDIT FOR THE FIRST TIME. VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS HI HI MATTER CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS -- ANDREW NO WELL I'M A MUTUAL HOUSING RED IS INDEED -- PARTICULAR THIS PROGRAM IS ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE AND BUILDING THEIR CREDIT AT MY COMMUNITY WE HAVE PEOPLE THAT ARE EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY ONE THAT ARE NOW GETTING CREDIT. BECAUSE OF THEM PAYING RENT ON TIME I THINK THAT'S GREAT WE ALSO HAVE IN DAVIS COMMUNITY ADD TO RESIDENT MEMBERS THAT ARE JUST EIGHTEEN STARTING OFF THEIR STRONG CREDIT IN BUILDING. THEIR OR CREDIT THROUGH MAXIMIZING YOUR CREDIT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM GIVES ME AND OTHER WITH RESTRICTED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVES TO BUILD CREDIT GIVEN. THE RESTRICTIVE INCOME THAT THEY HAVE SOLD WE'RE TRYING TO BUILD IT GIVES SOME OF US ONLY HAVE ONE CREDIT CARD TRYING TO BUILD OUR CREDIT BUT NOW WE'RE DOING BETTER. GREAT AND IT SAYS BE CAREFUL THOUGH YOU KNOW CRITICAL YEAH THEN THEY CAN GET YOU CAN THEY CAN KILL YOU.

WORK IN THIS AREA FOR A WHILE SO IT'S A GOOD IDEA AND WOULD MOVE THE BILL AT THE VERY GOOD. ALL RIGHTS TING NO OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN A WAY SO THERE'S NO. OBJECTION TO THE BILL YOUR SUPPORT VERY GOOD. THE THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE RULES. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON I BORDERS. ALAN. MONNING EYES STERN. STERN I BURKE. UMBERG HIGHWAY CASKEY ACOSTA BY ALL RIGHT THAT THE BILL HAS SIX VOTES WILL LEAVE THE ROLL UP AND THANK YOU SENATOR HUESO. AND NOW YOU MAY LEAVE. ALL RIGHT NEXT UP SENATOR HERTZBERG. FILE ITEM SEVEN SB. TWO TWO NINE WELL I'M SURE YOU HEARD THIS MEASURE AND LABOR COMMITTEE JUST SOME DAYS AGO -- BASICALLY IN A NUTSHELL A GOOD YEAR. BASICALLY TO THAT SHOW. WHAT HAPPENS IS WE'VE GOT THIS EXTRAORDINARILY DIFFICULT PROCESS WHEN SOMEBODY -- IS A WHISTLE BLOWER AND THE NUMBER OF DAYS IT TAKES IT HAS TAKEN HISTORICALLY FOR THEIR CASES EVEN BE HEARD THE IMPACT ON THE EMPLOYEE. WHO STANDS IN GOOD FAITH TO SOLVE A HELL OF A HEALTH ISSUE OR SAFETY ISSUE ON THE JOB? IS PUT IN HARM'S WAY THEIR FAMILY WITHOUT. OFTEN WITHOUT PAY AND SO A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO WE DID A MEASURE IN THIS HERE THAT BASICALLY DID TOO BROAD THINGS ONE GAVE INJUNCTIVE RELIEF POWER WHERE THERE WAS OVERWHELMING EVIDENCE FOR THE LABOR COMMISSIONER TO PROCEED. AND SECONDLY TO OUR GAVE THE LABOR COMMISSIONER POWER TO ISSUE CITATIONS AND PENALTIES DIRECTLY TO ENFORCE. RETALIATORY CLAIMS WERE WHISTLEBLOWER CLAIMS. BUT IN THE PROCESS AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY IS OFTEN THE CASE IN. THE LAWS ALL OF WHEN THE HOME SAYS THE LIFE OF THE LAW HAS NOT BEEN LOGIC IT'S BEEN EXPERIENCE. AND THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE LEARNED IS THAT THERE'S KIND OF A HOLE IN THAT PROCESS THE THE CURRENTLY UNDER THE LAW THE LABOR COMMISSION OF THE LABOR COMMISSIONER DETERMINES. SECTION NINETY EIGHT POINT SEVEN FOUR AFTER INVESTIGATION THAT THERE'S A VIOLATION. THE LABOR COMMISSIONER SHOWER WITH REGIONAL POMPOUS ISSUE CITATION. THERE IS A RIGHT IN THIS BILL FOR SOMEONE TO REQUEST A HEARING WITHIN THE CASE WHERE THEY HAVEN'T. THIS IS WHERE THIS BILL FILLED THE WHOLE. IT SAYS IF NO HEARING IS REQUESTED TO PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH ONE TO WHICH I JUST REFERRED A CERTIFIED COPY THE CITATION MAY BE FILED WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER IN THE OFFICE OF THE CLERK OF THE SUPERIOR COURT. THEN THERE COULD BE AND IN FORCE WE BELIEVED AND STILL BELIEVE THAT WE DO WE REALLY NEED TO TAKE SOME GREATER STEPS TO BETTER PROTECT WORKERS FROM RETALIATION -- THE PROCESS BY LARGE WORKS WELL BUT IT TAKES A VERY LONG TIME MAKE IT TAKES UP TO ABOUT THREE YEARS FOR WORKERS. TO GET ANY KIND OF RELIEF WHEN THAT RETALIATION HAPPENS FOLLOWING IN THEIR DECISION TO REPORT ILLEGAL ACTIVITY. AND WHILE WE DO STAND BY THREE OH SIX IT DID TURN OUT THERE WERE A FEW AREAS IN THE BILL THAT WOULD BENEFIT FROM SOME GREATER CLARITY. HERTZBERG COVER THOSE -- IT ALSO WE THINK MAKES IT PRETTY BUT WE THINK IT'LL IN SOME WAYS REDUCE THE LITIGATION IN THE SYSTEM BECAUSE THE THE PROCESS ENVISIONED BY SB. THREE OH SIX DIDN'T GIVE ALL OF THE THE WORKERS A DEAL IS EXACTLY WHAT THEY NEEDED TO JUST ENFORCE THE CITATION AS IT STANDS IT LIKELY REQUIRES THE FILING OF A LAWSUIT WHEN THAT'S NOT REALLY NECESSARY AND SO WE THINK. THIS BILL WILL TAKE A LOT OF THAT UNNECESSARY LITIGATION OUT OF THE SYSTEM -- IT MAKES A FEW OTHER CHANGES THAT WE THINK WE'LL BOTH PROTECT DUE PROCESS FOR EMPLOYERS BUT MAKE IT SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE A LITTLE BIT MORE FAMILIAR WITH IT LOOKS LIKE. THE PROCESS THAT EXISTS FOR OTHER TYPES OF CLAIMS BEFORE DEAL ESSIE AND OVERALL WE THINK IT IS A LOT OF CHANGE IT PRESENTS A LOT OF CHANGES THAT WE THINK MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK BETTER WE URGE OUR SPORT. YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT IF YOU'D STEP FORWARD WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. VERY CLEAR CHART WITH THE CALIFORNIA PLAN MILLERS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. RIGHT SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. MOTION BY SENATOR UMBERG AND TO OFFER.

JACKSON AYE JACKSON AYE FOR JUST. ALLEN. ALLEN AYE CABALLERO. CARRIER -- AYE MONNING. MONNING AYE STERN. STERN I AM BURKE. NUMBER FIVE WHAT KELSEY MY CAL SKI I ALL RIGHT THE THE BILL HAS SEVEN VOTES AND WE WILL HOLD THE ROLL OPEN FOR THE ACTION THE REMAINDER CENTERS ARE VERY MUCH THANK YOU VERY MUCH. ALRIGHT WE HAVE -- TWO BILLS LEFT BY NON MEMBER AUTHORS THOSE ARE FILE ITEM TEN SB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT BY SENATOR JONES. AND WE HAVE A S. BEEF SEVEN FORTY ONE BY SENATOR GALGIANI FILE ITEM. SIXTEEN NEITHER OF THOSE. FOLKS ARE HERE SO I AM HAPPY TO GO AHEAD AND GO TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE IF WE COULD ASK THOSE OTHER TWO TO COME DOWN OR WOULD JUST KEEP GOING WITH MEMBERS. WE WILL START WITH FILE ITEM FOR WHICH IS SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKIS BILL SB. ONE EIGHTY SEVEN YOU WANT TO DO SO. ALREADY GOOD AFTERNOON SENATOR Y. CASKEY THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS SB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN SIMPLY CLARIFIES THAT THE TERM CONSUMER DEBT AND THE ROSENTHAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. INCLUDES. MORTGAGE DEBT THE ROSENTHAL ACT WAS ESTABLISHED TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM DECEPTIVE DISHONEST AND REASONABLE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES HOWEVER THE LANGUAGE IS SILENT RESPECT WHETHER IT. APPLIES TO PERSONS OR ENTITIES -- TRYING -- TO COLLECT THE MORTGAGE THAT AS SET FORTH IN THE EXCELLENT ANALYSIS WITHOUT THE CLARIFICATION CONSUMERS WITH MORTGAGE THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE HARASSED. THE COURT AND DAVIDSON VERSUS -- TO TERRACE ILLUSTRATES HOW VICIOUS AND CONFRONTATION. CONFRONTATIONAL MORTGAGE COLLECTOR CAN GET THE MORTGAGE COLLECTOR -- SO TERRACE CALLED MR DAVISON'S HUNDREDS OF TIMES IN THE SPAN OF A FEW MONTHS CERTAINLY TO FORT NEGATIVE CREDIT INFORMATION THE CREDIT BUREAUS AND THREATENED TO FORECLOSE IS HOME. THESE CALLS PERSISTED EVEN AFTER HE EXPLAINED THE PAYMENTS WERE ALREADY. COMPLETED FOR THAT THEY WERE NOT YET TO THIS IS AN EGG EXACT TYPE OF HARASSMENT THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE SOUGHT TO PREVENT WHEN ENACTED THE ROSENTHAL ACT. I AGREE WITH THE CURRENT CALIFORNIA COURT MAJORITY THAT MORTGAGE THAT IS INCLUDED IN CONSUMER DEBT SB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN WILL MAKE THIS CLEAR IN ADDITION MY BILL REMOVES THE EXCEPTION THAT ATTORNEYS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ACT -- THIS ADDRESSES THE MULTIPLE CASES OF SOLO PRACTICING ATTORNEYS AND LAW FIRMS HARASSING INDIVIDUALS FOR PAYMENT AND WITH ME IS -- SHARON JAMAL FROM THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD AFTERNOON -- AS YOU HEARD SB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN PROTECTS CONSUMERS WITH MORTGAGE DEBT FROM HARASSMENT AND OTHER ABUSIVE DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES. IN THE SAME VEIN SB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN ALSO PREVENTS CREDITORS FROM FARMING OUT DEBT COLLECTION ACTIVITY TO INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ROSENTHAL ACT. WHY SHOULD A PERSON BE MORE VULNERABLE TO HARASSMENT BECAUSE THEIR CREDIT OR HIRE SOMEONE WHO CAN SIDESTEP THE PROTECTIONS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATUTE? ORIGINALLY THE FEDERAL FAIR DEBT COLLECTION PRACTICES AT ALSO EXEMPTED ATTORNEYS. BUT SOME CREDITORS RESPONDED BY PLACING THEIR ACCOUNTS WITH UNSCRUPULOUS LAW FIRMS AND SEVEN ON ATTORNEY DEBT COLLECTORS THESE LAW FIRMS CAN ENGAGE IN DECEPTIVE AND ABUSIVE COLLECTION PRACTICES WITHOUT RISK OF LIABILITY UNDER THE FDCPA. TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM GROWING HARM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THIS ACTIVITY CONGRESS IN NINETEEN EIGHTY SIX RESCINDED THE ATTORNEY EXEMPTION. AT AB CLC WE REGULARLY TALK TO CONSUMERS HER EXPERIENCE HARASSMENT AND DECEPTIVE PRACTICES BY THOSE WHO ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE RESIN BALL ACT. FULL PROPRIETOR LAW OFFICES AND GENERAL PARTNERSHIPS WE RECENTLY ASSISTED A CLIENT WHO WAS TOO ASHAMED TO COME HERE TODAY TO TESTIFY IN PERSON BUT TOLD ME I COULD SHARE HIS STORY AND HONESTLY. MR S. WAS UNABLE TO PAY BACK ALONE AFTER HE BECAME DISABLED AND WAS LIVING ON SSI FOR MONTHS AND MONTHS HE WAS HARASSED BY SOMEONE WORKING IN A LAW OFFICE HE WAS PRESSURED YELLED AT THREATEN AND REPEATEDLY LIED TO ABOUT WHAT ACTIONS A LAW OFFICE INTENDED TO TAKE TO COLLECT. THE DEBT. THE INSISTENT EVEN CALLED HIM TO PRESSURE HIM TO PAY AFTER WE OFFICIALLY SIGNED ON TO REPRESENT HIM. MANY OF THESE ACTIVITIES VIOLATED THE RESIN OFF ROSENTHAL ACT HOWEVER NEITHER THE ATTORNEY NOR THE LAW OFFICE WAS SUBJECT TO THE REMEDIES ABOUT LAW. ATTORNEYS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE ROSENTHAL ACT THEY'LL BE LITTLE PROTECTION FOR MANY OF OUR CLIENTS LIKE MR ****. AND LIKE BEFORE CREDITORS WILL FLOCK TOWARD SEIZE UNREGULATED AND SKI RELATED ATTORNEYS. WITH RECENT EFFORTS BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SCALE BACK PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS I URGE YOU TO VOTE IN SUPPORT OF SB ONE EIGHTY SEVEN SO CALIFORNIA.

THE FOUR HUNDRED DOLLAR FIGURE AND WE KNOW THAT THE SAID BUT THE SUDDEN CLEANING OUT OF YOUR BANK ACCOUNT TAKES A PERSON WHO IS ON THE EDGE AND PUSHES HER OVER AT NOTHING IN THIS BILL STOPS AT THAT COLLECTED FROM SEEKING REPAYMENT.

VERY GOOD THANK YOU SIR Y. CASKEY GOOD AFTERNOON AND AGAIN TWO MINUTES PLEASE. THANK YOU. THANK LEVEES DEVASTATE PEOPLE'S LIVES IMAGINE ONE DAY GOING TO AN ATM. OR USE YOUR DEBIT CARD AND YOUR ACCOUNT HAS BEEN COMPLETELY WIPED OUT WITHOUT ANY NOTICE. ALL THE CHECKS YOU WROTE FOR RENT AND UTILITIES WELL BOUNCE YOU'RE LEFT WITH THE CHANGE IN YOUR POCKET. AT AB CLC WE REGULARLY TALK TO CONSUMERS -- HAVE EXPERIENCE EXACTLY THIS THE VAST MAJORITY OF THEM HAD EXAM MONEY TAKEN OUT OF THEIR ACCOUNT. WELL CREDITOR CAN ONLY TAKE A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF YOUR INCOME WITH A GARNISHMENT WHEN IT COMES TO LEVY THEY CAN TAKE THE ENTIRE AMOUNT -- AND FROM CLIENTS -- WERE ABLE TO GET THEIR MONEY BACK AFTER MANY MANY MONTHS -- FOR OTHERS IT WAS TOO LATE BY THE TIME I FOUND HELP. I'M FOR QUITE A FEW THE BANK LEVY WAS THE FIRST TIME IT ACTUALLY LEARNED OF THE JUDGMENT -- FOR SOME THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THE LEVY LEAD TO HOMELESSNESS. ONE OF OUR CLIENTS WHO WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY BUT COULD NOT MISS WORK ASKED ME TO SHARE HER STORY. NAME IS TASHA MONIQUE DOWN SAN AND I LIVE IN OAKLAND CALIFORNIA I SUFFER FROM DISABILITIES THAT PREVENT ME FROM OBTAINING FULL TIME EMPLOYMENT. I HAVE EXPERIENCE ENORMOUS HARDSHIP SINCE BECOMING DISABLED AND MY ONLY GOAL IS TO FIND A WAY TO SUPPORT MYSELF AND TO BRING STABILITY TO MY LIFE. EVEN AS I TRY MY HARDEST TO OVERCOME THESE CHALLENGES THE CLOUD OF BANK LEVEES AND JUDGMENTS AGAINST ME REMAINS. THE TO JUDGMENTS ARE NOW OVER TEN YEARS OLD AND BOTH HAVE MORE THAN DOUBLED IN SIZE DUE TO INTEREST FROM TEN THOUSAND COMBINED. TO WELL OVER TWENTY THOUSAND AT NO POINT HAVE I HAD THE FUNDS TO PAY THIS JUDGMENT. MY ACCOUNT WAS FIRST LOVE IT I WAS CONFUSED AND SCARED ALL EIGHTEEN HUNDRED IN THE ACCOUNT WAS TAKEN. AN ADDITIONAL FEE WAS ADOPTED SO I HAD TO PAY THE BANK FIFTY DOLLARS BEFORE I CAN EVEN ACCESS MY ACCOUNT AGAIN. THE LOSS OF EIGHTEEN HUNDRED WAS UNTHINKABLE AND MAN I COULDN'T PAY BASIC BILLS LIKE RENT EVEN NOW THE LOSS OF FIFTY DOLLARS MEANS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHETHER OR NOT I CAN AFFORD GROCERIES. THE ONLY REASON I WAS ABLE TO RECOVER THIS MONEY BECAUSE ONE DAY WHEN I WAS CRYING IN MY CAR AS RESULT OF THE STRESS. I DECIDED TO CAREFULLY READ THROUGH ALL THE PAPERWORK AND REALIZE THAT MY MONEY MIGHT BE EXAM BECAUSE I RECEIVE PUBLIC ASSISTANCE WITH MY HOUSE AND THE NEXT STEPS I HAD TO TAKE WERE UNCLEAR. ALTHOUGH I VENTURA COUNTY BE CLC I FELT THE PAPERWORK ON THE FINAL DAY BUT I HAD TO GO TO SAN FRANCISCO IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK TAKING TIME AND MONEY THAT I DID NOT HAVE. EVEN WITH THE HELP OF AN ATTORNEY IT TOOK ME THREE MONTHS AND MULTIPLE COURT APPEARANCES TO GET MY MONEY BACK I WAS ONLY ABLE TO PAY MY BILLS DURING THIS TIME BECAUSE I BORROWED MONEY FROM FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I WAS ABLE TO RECOVER THAT MONEY BUT CONTINUED HARDSHIP HAS MEANT THAT I RECEIVED THANK LEVEES WHEN THERE'S ONLY TWENTY OR THIRTY DOLLARS IN THE ACCOUNT. EVEN WHEN THE SMALL AMOUNTS ARE TAKEN IN CHARGE THE BANK FEE PREVENTING ME FROM HAVING REGULAR ACCESS TO A BANK ACCOUNT. I THINK YOUR SUPPORT SB SIX ONE SEVEN THANK YOU. SIX WITNESS PLEASE TWO MINUTES THANK YOU MADAM CHAIRWOMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JESSICA BUCKLEY WITH A WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY AND TO KEEP IT BRIEF. YOU KNOW I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE MOST POPULAR BILLS AMONG LEGAL SERVICES THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOTTEN I PERSONALLY GET SEVERAL CALLS AND EMAILS TO CHECK IN ON THE BILL STATUS THEY FREQUENTLY SEE PEOPLE COMING INTO THEIR EVICTION CLINICS. BECAUSE THEY'RE BEING AFFECTED. BECAUSE OF A BANK LEVY -- THEY HAVE PEOPLE COMING IN WHO DID NOT KNOW THAT THEY WERE GOING TO HAVE THEIR BANK ACCOUNT LEVY. YOU WILL HEAR FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT -- THEY KNEW% THEY HAD LOTS OF NOTICE THEY'VE KNOWN FOR YEARS SAVE ALL THIS MONEY. BUT THINK ABOUT IT LOGICALLY IF A PERSON KNOWS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO GET THEIR MONEY TAKEN OUT OF A BANK ACCOUNT. DO THEY LEAVE THEIR MONEY IN THE BANK ACCOUNT. THEY DON'T THE FACT THAT THE MONEY IS BEING LEVIED IS PROOF THAT THEY DON'T HAVE A NOTICE -- MOST OF PEOPLE HAVE THAT IT'S REALLY OLD THEY DIDN'T KNOW EXISTED OR THEY HAVE DEBT FROM A NEW PIECE OF SPOUSE -- OR FROM A PARENT. THEY AREN'T THEY DON'T KNOW THAT THAT IS GOING TO COME THEY DON'T KNOW THE MONEY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO USE FOR RENT IS BEING TAKEN -- SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT -- THAT FROM OUR LEGAL SERVICES AND OUR PARTNERS IN FROM WESTERN CENTER WE URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THE VOICES OF OUR OF OUR CLIENTS IN THIS CASE AND OUR DRIVER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF HUGE STEP FORWARD. BERMAN CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMER COALITION STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON TWO MINUTES TEACHER IF YOU WOULD HI GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR CLIFF BURKE HERE IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF COLLECTORS. I FIND THE NOTION OF DEFENDING BANK LEVEES LESS SYMPATHETIC THAN TALKING ABOUT VICTIMS OF BANK LEVEES. BUT I AM HERE TO POINT OUT TO THE COMMITTEE THAT A BANK LEVY IS A LAWFUL POLLUTION JUDGMENT TOOL USED BY CREDITORS. TO RECOVER JUDGMENTS FOR GOODS AND SERVICES THAT HAVE EXTENDED BY AN EQUAL APPEALING. PERSON IN THE COMMUNITY AND DISTRICTS A BUSINESS THAT LOAN. CREDIT TO AN INDIVIDUAL FOR GOODS OR SERVICES FOR WHICH THEY HAVE NOT BEEN PAID THE BANK LEVY IS A POST JUDGMENT TOOL SO IN ESSENCE. THE DEBT HAS BEEN IN THE COLLECTION PROCESS FOR PROBABLY OVER A YEAR WITH MULTIPLE ATTEMPTS MADE TO CONTACT THE DEBTOR AND TO GET THE DEBTOR TO EITHER AGREE TO A PAYMENT PLAN TO DISPUTE THE DEBT OR TO TO PAY THE DEBTS. ONLY AFTER IT'S BEEN COLLECTION FOR NEARLY A YEAR. DOES THE CREDITOR HAT AND COLLECTION AGENCY HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION AS TO WHETHER TO GO TO COURT AND HER THE COSTS OF GOING TO COURT. FILING FEES AND SAID FOR ITS CENTER ATTORNEY'S FEES TO GO TO COURT. TO GET THE JUDGMENT THE DEBTORS NOTIFIED OF THE JUDGMENT AGAIN. AND THEN THEY TRY TO COLLECT AGAIN IT THEN HAS TO GO BACK TO COURT TO GET RICH. SO IN ESSENCE THIS PROCESS HAS BEEN GONE GONE FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND AT THE OTHER END OF THIS DEBT IS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT BEEN PAID FOR GOOD TUNES SERVICES. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS BILL IS THE NATURE OF THE EXEMPTION. IS THAT IT IS AUTOMATIC. AND IT IS GOING TO BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PREVENT DEBTORS AND OTHER BAD ACTORS FROM USING MULTIPLE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AND MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS. TO MULTIPLY THE EFFECT OF THIS -- EXEMPTION. IN ESSENCE THE PROBLEM WITH HIS BILL IS THE NARRATIVE THE IS THAT IT'S TO PROTECT LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS. BUT HOW MANY LOW INCOME INDIVIDUALS HAVE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IN A FINANCIAL INSTITUTION SITTING IN A CHECKING ACCOUNTS. AND WE HAVE DISCUSSED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS BECAUSE IS A BAD BILL HAS BEEN AROUND FOR OVER TWO YEARS AND AS I PASSED. THE NOTION OF LIMITING THIS BILL TO THOSE WHO ARE TRULY. LOW INCOME WHICH IS WHAT WE WORKED OUT WITH THE OFF THEIR ON HIS BILL THE LIMITED. GARNISHMENT SO CONSUMER DEBTS BUT THERE'S BEEN NO EFFORT TO TRY TO NEGOTIATE THIS BILL DOWN TO LIMIT IT TO ACTUALLY LOW INCOME PEOPLE SO AT THIS POINT WE HAVE TO URGE YOUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER OF OTHER INDIVIDUALS IN OPPOSITION PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS TONY GIPSON I'M HERE IN OPPOSITION FROM ENCORE CAPITAL GROUP WHICH IS A LARGE THAT PURCHASING COMPANY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE INTENTION OF THE BILL IS GOOD WE IN NO WAY ARE OPPOSED TO HELPING LOW INCOME CONSUMERS HAVE EXEMPTIONS. IN FACT IT'S OUR POLICY TO EXEMPTS CONSUMERS WHO ARE OF HARDSHIP FOR GOING TO ANY KIND OF JOB LOSS MEDICAL SITUATION ETCETERA. AND IN FACT SOME OF THE PROPONENTS AS EXAMPLES WOULD BE ALREADY EXEMPT UNDER CURRENT POLICIES FROM WAGE GARNISHMENT AND BANK LEVEES. THANK LEVEES HOWEVER -- YOU HAVE TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EACH OF THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES -- THE IN THIS AUTOMATIC NO QUESTIONS ASKED EXEMPTION -- WHAT IT WOULD DO IS TAKE AWAY THE CURRENT PROCESS WHICH IS ABLE TO DECIPHER DOES SOMEONE NEED THE HELP OR IS THIS GOING TO ALLOW THEM AND OUT AND A WALK AWAY FROM TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS OF DEBT? AND WE SIMPLY CAN'T SUPPORT THIS NO QUESTIONS ASKED EXEMPTION -- THE EXEMPTIONS THAT EXIST IF THE CLAIM PROCESS SOMEONE MUST APPLY THE CREDITORS TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS WELL AS THE COURTS THE FOR THE PERSONAL FINANCIAL SITUATION OF THE CONSUMER. NOW THE REALLY IMPORTANT THING TO NOTE IS THAT THE BANK ACCOUNT OF THE DEBTOR. UNDER FEDERAL LAW UNDER TREASURY LAW IS REQUIRED TO REVIEW THAT TWO MONTHS WORTH OF DEPOSITS IN THE BANK ACCOUNT. TO DECIPHER IF SOMETHING IS EXEMPT SO FOR EXAMPLE IS A SOCIAL SECURITY IS THAT 75% OF WAGES PENSION MEDICARE VETERANS BENEFITS IF THEY ARE ABLE TO TELL THE SOURCE OF THE INCOME IS ANY OF THOSE EXEMPTIONS THE NET OUT THOSE AMOUNTS BEFORE RESPONDING TO THE LEVY. SO TO SAY THAT EVERY SINGLE DOLLAR IN THE BANK ACCOUNT IS BEING LEVIED IS SIMPLY NOT TRUE. WHAT THE CONSUMER DOES FILE FOR IS A NECESSITY OF LIFE OR ANYTHING ADDITIONAL THAT THEY FEEL THE BANK DID NOT THAT OUT AND THAT PROCESS? CREDITORS HAVE TO RESPOND WITHIN TEN DAYS IT IS A QUICK PROCESS IF IT LOOKS LEGITIMATE WE OF COURSE WILL RESPOND AND AND NOT OBJECT WHAT THE CREDITOR OBJECTS TO A BANK LEVY EXEMPTION CLAIM WHEN SOMETHING LOOKS. NOT APPLICABLE BMW CAR PAYMENT IF WE OBJECT TO GOES TO THE COURTS TO DECIDE IN THIRTY DAYS SO WE WE SIMPLY BELIEVE THAT. COULD WE MAKE IT IMPROVE THE CURRENT PROCESS MAKE THE FORMS EASIER PROVIDE THEM IN SPANISH REQUIRED THAT THEY BE PROVIDED TO CONSUMERS ABSOLUTELY BUT WE CAN'T SUPPORT AND NO QUESTIONS ASKED AUTOMATIC CLAIM THANK YOU VERY MUCH OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF YOU'D STEP FOR WITH YOUR NAME AND AFFILIATION. TIM LYNCH ON BEHALF OF THE RECEIVABLES MANAGEMENT ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION. CHRISTINA'S BAGNOLI ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. THAT WAY WHEN ELSE MOST NEVER SEE HERE ON BEHALF OF US CB AMERICA INC IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION PART WILL BRING THIS BACK TO THE DIET SENATOR UMBERG. THANK YOU SENATE Y. CASKEY A COUPLE QUESTIONS ONE JUDGMENT DEBTOR IS IT DEFINED AS AN INDIVIDUAL [inaudible] YES. ALL RIGHT -- THE SECOND QUESTION IS IT IT'S TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS PER ACCOUNT PRIDE -- DEBTOR -- DEBTOR YEAH YOU ONLY GET ONE ACCOUNT LAST YEAR'S BILL -- THERE WAS CONCERN THAT WAS RAISED BY OPPOSITION THAT YOU COULD THE PEOPLE WOULD SPRINKLE ALL THESE DIFFERENT ACCOUNTS OVER WITH MONEY AND AND THAT WE SAID NO AND THAT'S INCLUDED IN THIS BILL IS JUST. ONE TIME. UP NEXT QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT -- TO MISTER BERG'S COMMENT CONCERNING SOME SORT OF MEANS TESTING SLIDING SCALE UNITED DISCUSS THAT. I UNDERSTAND THAT THE THAT'S A CONTINUING CONVERSATION YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE AS THIS BILL MOVES. YEAH WE'VE BEEN WE'VE IT ALL. I DON'T THINK WE TAKE AWAY ANY TOOL WE JUST DON'T ALLOW THE TO WE WE LIMIT THE TOOL MEMBER THIS IS A MADE UP -- PROCESS THAT WE HAVE FOR FOR PEOPLE HAVE JUDGMENTS WE DECIDED THAT WOULD ALLOW CREDITORS TO GOING TO BANK ACCOUNTS IN AND AND TAKE THE AMOUNT. IS TWENTY DIFFERENT STATES TO HAVE TWENTY DIFFERENT LEVELS OF WHAT'S THE BUT NO LOOK COME OUT WHAT'S THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THAT YOU WANT TO HAVE -- FOR THE YOUR SOCIETY THE SOCIETY INDIVIDUALS -- IT'S GOOD TO BE THE SOLE SECURITY HITHER CORRECT THAT'S ALL SECURITY THEY DO LOOK BACK I THINK WE'RE MISSING THE POINT IS THAT PEOPLE'S MONEY IS FROZEN FOR THREE FOUR FIVE MONTHS AND I WOULD SAY FORGET. AMEND THE LOW INCOME PEOPLE AT SIX EXTREMELY. CHALLENGING FOR ANYBODY IF MY BANK ACCOUNT WAS FROZEN FOR THREE MONTHS I'VE BEEN IN TROUBLE I MEAN. IT WAS WITH THE STATE SENATE. PAYCHECK THAT I GET EVERY MONTH SO HERE WE'RE LOOKING AT A BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW TO FIX THIS OTHER THAN HAVE THE THE NO LOOK TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS MEME. LAST YEAR'S BILL WAS FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED TO GET OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE WE GOT TO THE SENATE ASSEMBLY FLOOR FORTY EIGHT HUNDRED I CUT IT TO TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED I CUT IT TO TWENTY ONE FIFTY I'M TRYING TO BAN. NOW I'M AT TWO THOUSAND TO SAY THIS IS THE MINIMUM AMOUNT YOU GET EVERYTHING ABOVE DECK. TO GET YOU KNOW IF THERE'S THREE THOUSAND YOU GET THE ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS SO. THAT'S OUR CHALLENGE WHAT WOULD. SO I UNDERSTAND -- AND TO BE CLEAR. YOU KNOW I I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE AUTOMATIC EXEMPTION AND THEN YOU AND I'VE TALKED ABOUT SOME SORT OF MITIGATION SUCH AS WAS CONTAINED IN WHICH GARNISHMENT THAT AND I UNDERSTAND. MAYBE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG THAT YOU YOU'RE A MINIMAL THAT CONVERSATION AND PERHAPS AMENDING THE BILL OBVIOUSLY NOT TODAY. BUT AT SOME POINT YEAH I MEAN. I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT. I I I I I YOU. KNOW I'VE I'M THINKING AOUT IT AND SAYING HOW DO YOU HAVE KIDS OF ON THE PAYCHECK YOUR PAYCHECK YOU LOOK AT IT AND WE HAVE A META AN AMOUNT THAT'S LIMITED WE'VE BEEN ABLE -- TO CHANGE THE LOSS TO THE LOWEST INCOME FOLKS. ARE ARE PROTECTED BUT YOU TAKE THAT. 75% OF YOUR PAYCHECK AND YOU PUT IN THE CHECKING ACCOUNT THE LEVY A CURSE THEY GET TODAY IT TO LEVY ALL THE AMOUNT SO IT'S WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF THE OF THE WAGE GARNISHMENT A LIMITATION THE WAGE GARNISHMENT -- BUT WE'RE WORKING ON IT WE IT'S IT'S IT'S IN OUR THINK TANK HI I DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT -- WHO HAVE A MEANS TEST Là ON THE BANK ACCOUNT? YOU KNOW -- I I THINK I THINK -- IN A WESTERN CENTER IS REALLY PROUD TO AND I THINK THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS -- TWO OF THE WAGE GARNISHMENT PROJECTIONS WE PUT IN PLACE AND THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WELL DESPITE THAT COMPLAINS THAT THEY WOULDN'T. AND THE CHARGES THAT IT WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO BE WORKABLE SEEMS TO BE WORKING FINE AND PROTECTING LOW INCOME WAGE EARNERS -- THE WE HAVE LOWERED THE AMOUNT. THE TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS -- IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THAT'S HOW MUCH WE THINK PEOPLE CAN SAVE EVERY MONTH AND HAVE THIS LIKE SITTING IN THE BANK THIS IS ACTUALLY TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IS WHAT SOMEBODY MIGHT HAVE EARNED -- LIKE IT IN A AND A CASH PAYMENT LIKE THAT A CONSTRUCTION WORKER ONE OF MY CLIENTS WAS A CONSTRUCTION WORKER AND SO HIS PAYMENTSWENT INTO THE BANK ACCOUNT. AND THAT WAS WHAT WAS LEVY AND HE GOT A NOTICE OF THAT LEVY WHILE HE WAS IN THE HOSPITAL AND HIS WIFE WAS HAVING A MISCARRIAGE. THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW THEY WERE GOING TO GET THROUGH THE NEXT DAY -- AND AND TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS IF YOU'RE LIVING JUST A PAYCHECK TO TO RENT PAYMENT IS NOT THAT MUCH MONEY. ARE WE ARE WE ARE SPONSORS PREPARED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT LESS -- YOU KNOW I I THINK THAT'S BECAUSE SPONSORS WE'RE WILLING TO TO BE WITH OUR OUR CHAMPION AND AND TALK ABOUT IT BUT WE WANT YOU TO UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS NOT AN UNREASONABLE AMOUNT. AND AND AND THE AND THE CONVERSATION THAT IT'S YOU KNOW THE ASSERTION THAT IT'S OKAY WELL FIRST OF ALL THAT MEDICAID AS IN ANYBODY'S BANK ACCOUNT. IS NOT TRUE AND SO TO BE HERE ON TESTIMONY AND SAY THAT YOU LOOK AT THEIR BANK ACCOUNT FOR THE MEDICAID. IS IS IT A FALSE STATEMENT AND SO IT OPENS UP A QUESTION AS TO WHETHER ANY OF THE STATEMENT HAS BEEN TRUE OKAY I BUT I THINK IF WE WANT TO TIME WE CHOSE. EXCUSE ME THE CLUTCHES FOCUS% OBVIOUSLY YOU HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THE AMOUNT IN THE IN THE ANALYSIS ON PAGE -- SEVEN IT THE IT DISCUSSES THE FACT THAT -- THERE ARE SIXTEEN OTHER STATES THE CURRENTLY PROVIDE EXEMPTIONS. ON THE HIGH END MISSISSIPPI AND TENNESSEE PROTECT TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS. ON THE LOW END YOU HAVE -- ARIZONA IN PENNSYLVANIA THIS PROTECTIONS THREE HUNDRED AND WE HAVE STATES LIKE MASSACHUSETTS IN NEVADA WHERE THE EXEMPTION APPLIES AUTOMATICALLY. AS WITH THIS BILL SO WITH SO WHICH THIS IS NOT OFF THE WALL IN TERMS OF ITS. YEAH. THE QUESTION IS IS IS NOT THE AMOUNT THE QUESTION IS HOW IT'S APPLIED IN AND I TAKE YOUR POINT THAT FOR CONSTRUCTION WORKER WHOSE SPOUSES IN THE HOSPITAL HAVING A BABY. WHO HAS ZERO OTHER MEANS THAT THAT THAT TWO THOUSAND DOES NOT ENOUGH BUT BUT THERE ARE SOME SCOFFLAWS AND WE DON'T NEED TO GET INTO IT? WHO WHO DO? INAPPROPRIATELY BENEFIT BUT THE THE NEXT QUESTION IS WITH RESPECT TO THE NOSE OF EXEMPTION BECAUSE OF EXEMPTION GOES AFTER LEVY. THIS IS SOMEWHAT OFF TOPIC BUT SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS IT THE NOTICE OF EXEMPTION OFTENTIMES. THAT CONSUMER DEBT -- THAT THE JUDGMENT IS RENDERED AS WELL AS A AS A DEFAULT JUDGMENT. AND SO AT THAT POINT TIME THE DEFAULT JUDGMENT HAS BE SERVED UPON THE DEBTOR. IT POINT TIME AT THAT POINT TIME IT WOULD SEEM LOGICAL TO PROVIDE THE DEBTOR THE LIST OF EXEMPTIONS RATHER THAN LATER ON DOWN THE ROAD OF BECAUSE OF THE DEBTORS PROVIDED THAT LIST OF EXEMPTIONS AT THAT POINT IN TIME. THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY ACTUALLY FILE FOR ONE OF THE EXEMPTIONS ANYWAY SOMETHING FOR YOU TO CONSIDER IS IS PART OF THE PART OF THE BILL OF UNDERSTANDING THAT THE THE PURPOSE IS TO PROTECT. OF THOSE WHO DESERVE PROTECTION IS DEBTORS. SO ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT. WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT IN YOUR CLOTHES CENTER Y. CASKEY YES -- THIS GUY'S NOT GONNA FALL IF WE PASS THIS LAW MAYBE SOME PEOPLE HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HOUSE BECAUSE THE MONEY'S PROTECTED. THERE IS THERE ARE A VARIETY WAYS THE CREDITORS CAN COLLECT ON THEIR DEBT IF WE'RE FOCUSING ON THE PEOPLE OF MEANS IF YOU CAN GET A SHARE OF TO GO CONFISCATE SOMEBODY'S CAR. AND SALAS IF THEY HAVE MATERIAL YOU HAVE YOU HAVE WAYS OF FILING A LIEN AGAINST SOMEBODY WHO OWNS PROPERTY TO SCARE THEM TO GET THERE THERE'S PEOPLE OF MEANS THEY DID THAT THEY HAVE STUFF THAT YOU CAN. DO YOU CAN REPOSSESS YOU HAVE EVERY COUNTY SHERIFF ALL. FIFTY EIGHT OF THEM HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO IN AND SEES THAT PROPERTY TO IGNORE TO SATISFY THAT JUDGMENT WHICH NOT OFTEN USE I WILL GET THAT BECAUSE IT'S EASY JUST GO IN AND DAY OUT THE BANK ACCOUNTS SO -- WE'RE TRYING TO DO A LITTLE BIT FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THE EDGE AND AND IT -- THE BILL IN FRONT OF YOU IS A WATERED DOWN VERSION OF ITS. COUSIN FROM LAST YEAR THAT WE'VE TRIED TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND TRY TO BE REFLECTIVE OF MEMBERS WHO HAVE SOME CONCERNS ABOUT THIS TO CARVE OUT SOME LITTLE PROTECTION DAD. BUT WE CAN SAY TO THAT THE FOLKS AT THIS MONEY IS IS PROTECTED AND I WILL CONTINUE TO LOOK AT NOTICE THE PEOPLE UNDER THE EXEMPTIONS. WHEN THEY DO GET THE JUDGMENT NAY WITH THE PROBLEM WE HAVE IS A LOT OF PEOPLE THEY GO BY DEFAULT IN THE GOES THE WRONG ADDRESS AND THEY NEVER? AS IN ELSE'S POINTS OUT 40% OF THEM DON'T EVEN KNOW THAT THEY HAVE A JUDGMENT AGAINST HIM SO WITH THAT I WOULD. URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK GODDESS BILL AND I JUST AGAIN IT'S ONE EXEMPTION PER INDIVIDUAL NOT PER BANK ACCOUNTS SO. WITH THAT THE MOTION IS TO PASS THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON AYE JACKSON I BORDERS ALAN. ALLEN I COVER EURO. OF MONNING AYE MONNING AYE STERN. STERN I BURKE. NUMBER I Y. CASKEY. I CASKEY AYE ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS A SIX VOTES WE WILL HOLD THE ROAD OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS AND INVITE. SENATOR JONES WHO IS FILE ITEM TEN SB. FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT IT IS STILL AFTERNOON SO ARE WE SURE GOOD AFTERNOON AND WELCOME. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I UNDERSTAND THAT THE COMMITTEE ASKED FOR A LONG AND LANKY PRESENTATION WITH MULTIPLE DOZENS OF SUPPORTERS ON THIS ISSUE. WELL ALL WE ASK ACTUALLY IS THAT YOU CONFIRM THAT YOU'RE GOING TO ACCEPT THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS ON PAGE FOUR AND COMMENT TO AN PAGE. SIX IN COMMON THREE OF THE ANALYSIS THAT I'M SURE I'D BE HAPPY TO DO SO EXCELLENT AND WITH THAT I'LL JUST DO A QUICK INTRODUCTION -- BILL -- FIVE SENATE BILL FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT UPDATES THE LAWS. GOVERNING TIME SHARES. THIS BILL REMOVES A SEEMINGLY ARBITRARY REQUIREMENT FOR TIME CHER'S TO OFFER LODGING TO POTENTIAL CONSUMERS WITHIN A TWENTY MILE RADIUS. OF THE PROPERTY BEING PRESENTED REMOVING THIS REQUIREMENT WILL ALLOW THE TIME SURE COMPANY TO OFFER MORE ATTRACTIVE ACCOMMODATIONS TO THEIR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY SB FIVE SEVENTY EIGHT EXPAND THE ARBITRATION OPTIONS MEMBERS OF A TIME SHARE AGREEMENT ARE ALLOWED TO USE. CURRENT LAW LIMITS ARBITRATION OPTIONS TO THE AMERICAN ARBITRATION ASSOCIATION HOWEVER OTHER QUALIFIED COMPANIES ARE AVAILABLE THAT OFTEN OFFER. MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED OPTIONS SUCH AS TELECOMMUTING WHICH IS VERY USEFUL IN SITUATION LIKE THIS FOR THE COMPANY AND THE CONSUMER. MOST LIKELY DO NOT LIVE IN THE SAME PLACE WITH ME TODAY IS JOHN CALDWELL REPRESENTING THE AMERICAN RESORT DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATION. AND OVER THERE TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD. IF YOU HAVE I'M JUST HERE FOR ANY QUESTION -- ALL RIGHT THAT'S EVEN BETTER. THE STATEMENT RIGHT RIGHT THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN SUPPORT. ANY WITNESSES IN [inaudible] OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS FROM THE DíAS. RIGHT THE MOTION. MOTION BY SENATOR STERN I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO THOSE AMENDMENTS AND I THINK THAT THE SUNSET CLAUSE WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE -- TO TO MONITOR THE EXEMPTION TO EXISTING RESTRICTIONS OR ON TEMPORARY ACCOMMODATIONS TO SEE THAT THERE ARE NO. ADVERSE EFFECTS ON CONSUMERS AND TO APPRECIATE YOUR DOING THAT. AND JUST POINTING OUT THAT ARBITRATION HAS GENERALLY BEEN DISFAVORED BY THE COMMITTEE BUT BECAUSE IT IS ALREADY THE LAW -- AND THIS BILL IS JUST MERELY -- EXPANDING IT TO INCLUDE THIRD PARTY ARBITRATION ORGANIZATIONS WHICH EXIST OTHER THAN. A TRIPLE A KID HAD THE THE THE INDUSTRY HAS EXPANDED -- SO THAT THERE THERE SHOULD BE THAT OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO HAVE THAT CHOICE SO WITH THAT -- WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS AS AMENDED AND MA'AM SECTOR PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. JACKSON HI JACKSON AYE FORTUS. ALLEN. ALLEN I COVER EURO [inaudible] MONNING. MONNING EYES STERN. STERN I AM BURKE [inaudible] I KELSEY. PART THAT HAS FOUR VOTES OF WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN NEEDS FIVE AND WE'LL WAIT FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS TO GET BACK YOU COLLEAGUES THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WILL NOW GO TO SENATOR ALLEN WHO HAS TO MEASURES UP AND IF WE COULD GET. A CALL TO CENTER GALGIANI IF YOU WOULD LIKE. TO PRESENT WOULD LOVE TO HAVE HER. OH OKAY GLOBAL STAR WAS SENATOR ALLEN AND THEN IF CENTER GALGIANI GETS HERE BEFORE THE NEXT BILL WILL GIVE FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY. RIGHT NOW WE'VE GOT FILE ITEM EIGHT SB THREE NINETY TWO ONE HAZARDOUS MATERIALS. CENTER ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS VIEW THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- SO THIS IS A A BILL RELATING TO GREEN CHEMISTRY. AND THIS BILL UPDATES AND STRENGTHENS OUR GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM IN ORDER TO PROTECT CONSUMERS FROM HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS IN THEIR DAILY LIVES. SO TEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA ESTABLISHED THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WITH VAN. A SIMILAR FEAR IS A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVEN NINE AND AND SENATOR SIMIANS SB. FIVE OH NINE AND THE PROGRAM RECOGNIZE THREE KEY THINGS FIRST OF ALL THE CLIFORNIANS ARE SOMETIMES I KNOWINGLY EXPOSED TO HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS. I IN THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY USE. TO THAT THE STATE HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN PROTECTING -- CALIFORNIANS IN THAT IN THAT IN THAT SENSE. AND THREE THAT USING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE IN A CLEAR TRANSPARENT REGULATORY PROCESS IS THE BEST WAY TO DO THIS. SO THE DEPARTMENT TALK SUBS CONTROL DID YES HE TOOK THE LEGISLATURE'S MANDATE UNDER -- A. B. EIGHTEEN SEVEN NINE AND DEVELOP THE FIRST OF ITS KIND SEE FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN THIS PROGRAM -- FIRST IDENTIFIES CHEMICALS OF CONCERN -- THEN FINDS PRODUCTS WHERE THOSE CHEMICALS MAY BE AFFECTING USERS -- THEN DGSE SUPPOSED TO CALL UPON MANUFACTURES TO FORM AN ALTERNATIVE ANALYSIS. TO FIND CHEMICALS THAT CAN BE SUBSTITUTED TO KEEP FOLKS SAFER WHILE STILL PROVIDING THE PRODUCTS THAT THEY WANT AND NEED. THE GOALS OF THE FREE MARKET TO SEE FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM ARE COMMENDABLE THE WHAT BRINGS ME HERE TODAY -- IT TO PRESENT SB THREE NINETY TWO IS THE PROGRAM'S TIMELINE. HERE'S THE SHOCKING THING AND WE HAD THIS PROGRAM FOR TEN YEARS NOW AND TODAY. NO CHEMICAL NOT SING NOT ONE SINGLE CHEMICAL HAS HAD AN ALTERNATE ANALYSIS COMPLETED UNDER THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM. AND NO REGULATIONS HAVE RESULTED. SO OUR GREAT PROGRAM OF THE BOOKS NOT HELPING ANYBODY OUT YET TEN YEARS IN. AND IN FACT -- THE PUBLIC HEALTH INSTITUTE I TOOK A LONG HARD LOOK AT THE PROGRAM -- LOOKING AT YOUR GREEN CHEMISTRY TEN YEARS IN. AND AND WE'VE GOT A COPY OF IT HERE SOMEWHERE AND AND EFFECTIVELY. BASICALLY LOOKED AT THE AT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE PROGRAM WAS SLOWING IT DOWN WHAT WAS WHAT WAS THE REASONS WHY. WE HAVEN'T HAD A SINGLE ANALYSIS COMPLETED INTO THE PROGRAM IN NO REGULATIONS. SO MY MY BILL BASICALLY COMES OUT OF THAT REPORT IT TAKES SOME OF THE KEY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE REPORT. SO IS TO STRENGTHEN THE PROGRAM AND ALLOW IT TO ACHIEVE ITS GOALS WHAT IS THE BILL TO THE BILL -- GRANTS DGSE CLEAR AUTHORITY TO TEAM PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA FROM MANUFACTURERS AND IF NEEDED THEIR CHEMICAL SUPPLIERS -- IT ADDS A NEW WITH OR DID LISTS OF CHEMICALS OF CONCERN TO FILL GAPS IN THE CURRENT LIST. IT REQUIRES THE TSC TO ADOPT A FIVE YEAR TIMELINE. TO IDENTIFY AND ASSESS PRIORITY PRODUCTS INCLUDING DATA COLLECTION THE FUNCTION BASED APPROACH TO AVOID REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION THIS IS THE TERM OF ART IN THIS AREA. TO REFER TO A SUBSTITUTE CHEMICALS THAT ACTUALLY MAY CAUSE MORE HARM THAN THE CHEMICAL THEY WERE SUBSIDY -- AND THEN IT FINALLY STREAMLINES THE INFORMAL RESOLUTION AN APPEALS PROCESS SEASON CREATES A FAST TRACK. FOR WIN EXISTING STUDIES SUPPORT REGULATORY RESPONSES. AS I SAID SENSIBLE WAY OF TRYING TO STRENGTH AND AND AND BASICALLY GIVE A FACT. TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM THAT WE ADOPTED TEN YEARS AGO AS A LEGISLATURE SO WITH ME HERE TODAY WE HAVE RV CAR FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL AND BILL -- YOU'D FROM THOUGH ENVIRONMENT WHILE WORKING GROUP. WHO ARE BOTH CONTESTANTS FOR THE BILL? THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO ME THE TEACHER IF YOU WOULD. ALLOW YOUR WITH ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP I'M PLEASED TO BE BEFORE THE COMMITTEE WITH SENATOR ALAN EWG CLEAN WATER ACTION AND AND OUR DC ARE THE THREE CO SPONSORS FOR THIS BILL. AND THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCT PROGRAM GOES BACK TO THE BEGINNINGS OF THE PROGRAM INCLUDING PARTICIPATING IN THE MULTI YEAR PROCESS TO ESTABLISH THE FEDERAL REGULATIONS. UNDER WHICH THE DEPARTMENT OPERATES THIS BILL THIS PROGRAM AND THE BILL OR ABOUT REAL WORLD EFFECTS ON ON REAL CALIFORNIANS FOR EXAMPLE SYNTHETIC FLAME RETARDANTS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO CANCER THYROID DESTRUCTION MEMORY. DELAYED MENTAL AND PHYSICAL DEVELOPMENT AT CETERA AN EARLY FOCUS OF THE PROGRAM IS TARGETING THESE CHEMICALS IN CHILDREN SLEEP MAPS. MASS THIS IS BUT ONE EXAMPLE OF WHY THE PROGRAM MUST WORK TO PROTECT THE MOST VULNERABLE POPULATIONS AND EVENTUALLY ALL CONSUMERS. HOWEVER THE REALITY OF THE PROGRAM IS NOT LIVING UP TO ITS POTENTIAL DESPITE CLAIMS IS JUST GETTING STARTED NEED TIMES TO SETTLE INTO WORKABLE RHYTHM. IS ONLY BEEN THREE REGULATORY ACTIONS TO PROD PRODUCT CHANGE IN TEN YEARS NO ALTERNATE ASSESSMENTS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED NO ACTIONS TAKEN. FROM ALL NOTE THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS BEEN RELUCTANT TO REGULATE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS INSTEAD DEFERRING TO THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM. THE LAST DECADE HAS GIVEN US EXPERIENCED IDENTIFY WHERE THE PROBLEMS ARE THE ORIGINAL LEGISLATION IN THE PROGRAM. SO THAT WE CAN FIX BARRIERS AND HOLES THAT WILL MAKE THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM WHEN IT NEEDS TO BE. SB THREE NINETY TO RESPOND DIRECTLY TO WHAT WE BELIEVE IN THE NEEDED REFORMS IN THE PROGRAM -- WE HAVE MET WITH THE OPPOSITION AND NOW WITH THE STAFF AND CENTERS STAFF IT'S A FAIR TO SAY WERE OPTIMISTIC ON CRAFTING AMENDMENTS THAT WILL MEET THEIR CONCERNS AS OUR ONGOING DISCUSSIONS. OF NOW YIELD TO AVI CAR OF AN RBC WILL ADDRESS THE BILL'S SPECIFIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TWO MINUTES PLEASE. HANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS AVINASH CAR I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY AND DIRECTOR FOR STATE HEALTH POLICY WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS -- FOR PRODUCTS PROGRAM IS AN ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ADDRESSING TOXIC CHEMICALS BEFORE THEY BECOME A PROBLEM. THAT IS FOCUSING ON PREVENTING TOXIC EXPOSURES IN THE FIRST PLACE RATHER THAN CLEANING UP AFTER THE FACT THE AND FIXING THE EFFECTS OF EXPOSURE AFTER THE FACT. MY COLLEAGUE BILL AALIYAH AND THE SENATOR HAVE OUTLINED BY THE IMPORTANT ROLE THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM IN PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE SLOW PACE OF THE PROGRAM TO DATE. A RECENT TEN YEAR RETROSPECTIVE OF THE CENTER OUTLINED -- OUTLINED THE TREMENDOUS PROMISE OF THE PROGRAM BUT ALSO THE STRUCTURAL FACTORS THAT ARE HOLDING IT BACK. MAKING A SERIES OF RECOMMENDATIONS FOR IMPROVEMENT. SB THREE NINE TWO ACTS ON THOSE RECOMMENDATIONS WOULD REMOVE SEVERAL THE STRUCTURAL BARRIERS HOLDING THE PROGRAM BACK. ONE KEY ISSUES THE PROGRAM'S LACK OF ACCESS TO PRODUCT INGREDIENT DATA. PROGRAM STAFF HAVE HAD TO RESORT TO GOOGLE SEARCHES AN UNSUCCESSFUL VOLUNTARY INDUSTRY REQUESTS TO GET INFORMATION PRODUCT INGREDIENTS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN LONG DELAYS AND HESITATION TO CONSIDER ALL THE PRINCIPAL INGREDIENTS. THE RESULT HAS BEEN US APARTMENT. AS BETWEEN NINE TO PROVIDE THE DEPARTMENT CLEARER STRONGER DATA COLLECTION AUTHORITY THAT WILL PRESERVE THE TRADE SECRET PROTECTIONS ALREADY IN THE GREEN CHEMISTRY Là. THE SECOND ISSUE IS A LACK OF DEADLINES AND CLEAR REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PROGRAMS OUTLINED TIME LINES FOR ACTION. WHICH A PRIVATE TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THE CURRENT THREE YEAR WORK PLANS ARE VAGUE. AND NOT SPECIFIC ENOUGH TO BE MEANINGFUL. THEY FACILITATE THE LENGTHY DELAYS THAT HAVE BEEN UNFORTUNATE FEATURE OF THE PROGRAM TO DATE. SB THREE NINE TWO WOULD REQUIRE THE AGENCY TO DEVELOP A WORK PLAN TO ADDRESS FIVE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND SUBCATEGORIES IN FIVE YEARS. IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THEM TO DEVELOP TIMELINE FOR THE VARIOUS STEPS INVOLVED. IT WOULD REQUIRE THE CONSIDERATION OF ALL CHEMICALS OF CONCERN THAT SERVE THE SAME PURPOSE A FUNCTION DISS SO THAT WE WILL HAVE THE SITUATION OF REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION AND HAVE THE PRODUCT COME BACK TO THE AGENCY A COUPLE OF YEARS LATER.

WELL GOVERNMENT MAN CHAIR AGAIN -- SO FIRST OF ALL LET ME START BY -- ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENT SUGGESTS THE HOUSES AND I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL -- ELECTED AND I CERTAINLY DO LOOK FOR TO WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE COMMITTEE AS THE POLICY IS PERFECTED -- LOOK WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET MORE. TV'S OUT THERE -- AND AND THAT'S PART OF OUR GOALS IS A STATE ELECTRIC VEHICLES COURSE THE BIG CHALLENGE INVOLVES CREATING MORE OF A CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S ONE OF THE GREATEST. INFRASTRUCTURAL CHALLENGES THAT WE HAVE TO GETTING MORE ELECTRIC VEHICLES OUT -- ON TO OUR ROADS. NOW THIS BILL ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE BY HELPING RENTERS. ACCESS ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING STATIONS BY REFORMING THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENT FOR INSTALLING THEM SO IN CURRENT LAW. IF A RENTER AND LOTS OF PEOPLE ARE RENTERS. WANTS TO INSTALL ANY V. CHARGING STATION THE LANDLORD HAS TO ALLOW IT. HOWEVER CURRENT LAW ALSO HAS A LET ME REQUIREMENTS TO THE LANDLORD CAN DEMAND ON THE PERSPECTIVE YOU THE OWNER BEFORE THEY CAN INSTALL THE NECESSARY CHARGING STATION. AND AND TOO OFTEN -- THEIR REQUIREMENTS AND SERVE TO INTIMIDATE AND CONFUSED TENANTS. NOW I'M FOCUSING ON ONE PARTICULAR -- WHICH IS A REQUIREMENT THAT A RENTER. BE ABLE TO CARRY A ONE MILLION DOLLAR INSURANCE. REQUIREMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THEIR U. V. -- CHARGING STATION NOW THERE IS SIMPLY NO EVIDENCE. THAT E. V. CHARGING STATION INSURANCE IS READILY AVAILABLE NOR IS THERE EVIDENCE OF A SITUATION ARISING WHERE YOU CHARGING STATION INSURANCE. WOULD ACTUALLY BE NEEDED. I BUT THERE ARE -- THE VAST MAJORITY OF LANDLORDS DON'T REQUIRE THIS BUT THERE ARE SOME OUT THERE THAT DO YOU -- AT THIS BILL REFORMS THE INSURANCE REQUIREMENT BY REMOVING THE ONE MILLION DOLLAR MINIMUM IN FAVOR OF A GENERAL REQUIREMENT OF INSURANCE -- THERE BY MAKING THE SWITCH TO T. V. MORE ACCESSIBLE FOR CALIFORNIA TENANTS. IT WOULD BE HERE TODAY I HAVE NOT KENNEDY RENTER I AM A CONSTITUENT OF MINE IS DEALT. WITH THIS PROBLEM FIRSTHAND TRYING TO HIS PART AND SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLE IN HIS APARTMENT COMPLEX. THANK YOU TWO MINUTES IF YOU WOULD. DEFINITELY MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME. HI MY NAME IS MATT KENNEDY I'M A RENTER IN THE WEST LA AREA -- WHO ATTEMPTED TO MAKE THE SWITCH TO ELECTRIC VEHICLE AND I'M HERE TO SUPPORT SB? SIX THREE EIGHT MY PASSION FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND CARBON REDUCTION INSPIRED ME TO FOUND MY OWN COMPANY MODE. WHICH IS DEVELOPING A DEVICE TO FILTER TOXIC PARTICLES FROM CARTEL PIPES. HOWEVER IRONICALLY. I HAD TROUBLE SWITCHING TO CLEAN ELECTRIC VEHICLE MYSELF -- DUE TO THE ONEROUS AND COMPLEX REQUIREMENTS FOR RENTERS IN STATUTE WHICH LANDLORDS ARE QUICK TO ENFORCE. SOME OF THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE ONE A MONTHLY RENTAL AMOUNT FOR THAT PARKING SPACE. TO PAYING ALL COSTS OF INSTALLATION OF THE CHARGING STATION AND IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE PRIOR TO INSTALLATION. THREE PROVIDE A COMPLETE FINANCIAL ANALYSIS AND SCOPE OF WORK REGARDING THE INSTALLATION. OF THE CHARGING STATION AND IT'S INFRASTRUCTURE. AND FOR A WRITTEN DESCRIPTION OF THE MODIFICATIONS CONSISTENT WITH THE PERMITTING CHECKLIST OF THE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY READING THIS GUIDE BOOK. PUBLISHED BY THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH AND THE LIST GOES ON AMONG THESE REQUIREMENTS IS A DAUNTING ONE MILLION DOLLAR INSURANCE APARTMENT FOR THE CHARGING STATION. I FOUND MYSELF WONDER. WHY SUCH REQUIREMENT WAS NECESSARY WHAT KIND OF DAMAGE COULD THE TRANSITION COST? AND IN WHAT SOONER WOULD I BE LIABLE AND NOT THE INSTALLER OR THE MANUFACTURER. WHERE CAN I FIND THIS INSURANCE? AFTER ONLINE SEARCHES YIELDED NOTHING I BEGAN MAKING INCREASED A MAJOR INSURANCE CARRIERS LIKE GEICO STATE FARM. GETTING A VARIETY OF TROUBLING ANSWERS FROM ALL THE CARRIERS. ALL THE CARRIERS WERE UNDERSTAND WE CONFUSE ABOUT THE STATUTORY INSURANCE MINIMUM. AND DID NOT HAVE READILY AVAILABLE POLICIES FOR MEAT THAT'S PURCHASE THAT WOULD SATISFY THE REQUIREMENTS THE CURRENT LAW. FOR RENTERS PARTICULARLY MAKING THE SWITCH TWENTY V. AND INSTALLING THE NECESSARY INFRASTRUCTURE IS COMPLICATED AND EXPENSIVE ENOUGH AS IT IS. THAT'S WHY I STRONGLY SUPPORT AS A SIX THREE EIGHT SENATE RENTERS LIKE ME WHO ARE TRYING TO MAKE THE SWITCH TV'S CAN HAVE MORE FLEXIBILITY IN INSURANCE THEY GET. FURTHER CHARGING STATION AND NOT BE SUBJECTED TO LARGE ARBITRARY MINIMUMS. MEMBERS -- MADAM CHAIR PLEASE JOIN ME IN SUPPORTING SB SIX THREE EIGHT THANK YOU.

WHICH I DO ALL THE TIME REPRESENTING SANTA BARBARA -- THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I THINK THE INITIAL CONCERN WAS THAT THESE THINGS WERE GOING TO BLOW UP OR CAUSE FIRES BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE WE'RE JUST SIMPLY ASKING FOR IS THAT YOU HAVE AN ELECTRICIANS WHO KNOWS WHAT THEY'RE DOING. PUT IN THIS. A SYSTEM WE'VE HAD NO PROBLEMS IN IN MY HOME AND TO FIVE FRANKLY WOULD LIKE. TO SEE THE BILL EXPANDED TO REQUIRE THAT LANDLORDS PROVIDE TV CHARGING STATIONS FOR ANY NEW CONSTRUCTION OR MAJOR REMODELS OF EXISTING RENTAL HOUSING STOCK I MEAN. THIS IS THE WAVE OF THE FUTURE IF WE CHOSE ALL GET IN. ON LINE WITH IT AND I KNOW THAT'S NOT YOUR BILL BUT I FEEL SO STRONGLY ABOUT THIS I MEAN I PLUG IN AND I CAN GET TWO HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY MILES ON A CHARGE -- TO TODAY'S CARS TO THAT I DON'T HAVE A TEST Là TIME. I'M A PUBLIC WE ARE SEEING TREMENDOUS ADVANCES. AND I APPRECIATE THAT YOU ARE TRYING TO DO YOUR PART I SUSPECT A LOT OF PEOPLE WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO DO THEIR PART.

BY UPDATING IN A LINE IN THE PROCESS FOR WHICH MARRIAGE CRTIFICATES AND BIRTH CERTIFICATES ARE PROCESSED CURRENT LAW STILL DISCLOSES THE ORIGINAL OR BIRTH NAME ON THESE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS. AND THEREFORE ALLOWS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF DISCRIMINATION OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE. SB SEVEN FORTY ONE WOULD FIX THIS AND THEREFORE PREVENT TRANSGENDER PEOPLE FROM DISCRIMINATION WHEN ROLLING THEIR CHILD AND SCHOOL APPLYING FOR A LOAN OR ONE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS NEED TO BE DISCLOSED. WITH ME TODAY SALAS KIND KESSLER WITH A QUALITY CALIFORNIA AND AMERICA HAZEN BUSH AN ATTORNEY WHO HAS FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE WITH THE PAIN. AND DIFFICULTY THE PROCESS A TRANSGENDER PERSON GOES THROUGH. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. PRETTY GOOD -- TO I'D LIKE TO INDICATE THERE'S NO OPPOSITION THAT IS BEEN RECORDED SO YOU CAN KEEP IT SHORT AND THAT WOULD BE WONDERFUL. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY MY NAME IS AMIR HIS AMBUSH AROUND US A LAW FIRM IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY THAT FOCUSES ON LGBT INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES. AS A PART OF THAT PRACTICE ISIS TRANSGENDER CLIENTS IN OBTAINING LEGAL NAME AND GENDER CHANGES. I ALSO SPENT FIVE AND A HALF YEARS WORKING FOR THE WILLIAMS INSTITUTE AN LGBT THINK TANK IT YOU SILLY SCHOOL OF LAW. AS A PART OF THAT WORK I DRAFTED AND PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FOR BILLS AND MODEL LAWS THAT IMPACTED THE LGBT COMMUNITY. IN THE LAST YEAR IT WORK FOR THE CLIENT WAS GOING THROUGH AN AMICABLE DIVORCE SHE DECIDED TO TAKE BACK HER MAIDEN NAME. EMOTION -- HUSBAND GREED TO HYPHENATE THEIR CHILDREN'S LAST NAMES AS A RESULT. HOWEVER WHEN SHE ASKED IF SHE COULD MODIFY HER OLDER CHILD BIRTH CERTIFICATES TO REFLECT HER HUSBAND'S GENDER HE A TRANSITION TO MAIL BETWEEN THE BIRTH OF THEIR FIRST AND SECOND CHILD. ALL I COULD TELL THERE WAS THAT IT WOULD COST MORE MONEY AND I COULDN'T GUARANTEE THE OUTCOME. WHICH IS NOT TO MAKE THE CHANGE AT ALL AND HE'S STILL LISTED ON THE CHILD ON THE CHILD'S BIRTH CERTIFICATE AS THE MOTHER OF THE CHILD. ANOTHER CLIENT HEARD ME TO COMPLETE HER NAME GENDER CHANGE ELEVEN MONTHS AGO. SHE RECEIVED HER COURT ORDER OF NAME AND GENDER CHANGE IN MID JULY EIGHT WEEKS AFTER WE FILED A PETITION WITH THE COURT. I GOT CONFIRMATION FROM HER THAT SHE FINALLY RECEIVED HER AMENDED MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE YESTERDAY. MORE THAN EIGHT MONTHS AFTER SHE RECEIVED HER JUDGMENT. IN ORDER TO GET HER NEW MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE WITH THE OLD ONE SEALED AND WITHOUT INDICATIONS OF HER FORMER NAME. I DROPPED IN SUBMITTED A LEGAL MEMO TO THE COURT HAD A FORMAL HEARING BEFORE JUDGE FILED A SEPARATE MOTION GOT THAT ORDER PARTIALLY PROVED SENT THIRTY EMAILS BACK AND FORTH WITH VITAL RECORDS BETWEEN JUNE OF LAST YEAR IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR. YES I COUNTED MADE COUNTLESS PHONE CALLS AND HEARD A VERY CAREFUL LINE BETWEEN BACKING INSISTING AND THREATENING. I SUCCEEDED ON BEHALF OF MY CLIENT AND SHE VERY LIKELY FOR HER HOW TO SIGN A FLAT FEE AGREEMENT WITH ME THE ONLY CHARGE FOR FOR ONE HOUR OF MY TIME. TO MEND HER MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE BUT THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRANSGENDER PEOPLE DO NOT HAVE THE FINANCIAL RESERVES TO HIRE PRIVATE COUNSEL TO COMPLETE THEIR NAME AND GENDER CHANGE PAPERWORK. AND I HONESTLY DON'T THINK THAT HER MARRIAGE CERTIFICATE A MOMENT COULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETE WITHOUT THAT THE ADVOCACY OF A LAWYER. FRANKLY I WASN'T EVEN SURE I COULD DO IT AND I'M NOT SURE EVERYWHERE WOULD GET THE SAME OUTCOME. THEY SHOULD NOT BE THE PROCESS THE CHANGE A SMALL THE FIX IS SIMPLE TRANSACTION BE ABLE TO HAVE THEIR LEGAL NAME AND GENDER CHANGE REFLECTOR PROPERLY ON ALL OF THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE DOCUMENTS NOT JUST THE BIRTH CERTIFICATE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS BRIEFLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ALICE KESSLER HERE ON BEHALF OF A QUALITY CALIFORNIA'S SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND FOR THE VERY COMPELLING REASONS STATED BY MY COLLEAGUE WE WOULD -- JURY LE.

MORNING. MORNING I STERN. STERN I AM A BURKE. Y. CASKEY. PART FORTY ZERO WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH LARA [inaudible] ALL RIGHT -- A NIELSEN. ALL RIGHT PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TO PRESENT SB FIVE SIXTY ONE THIS IS A MEASURE TO ENSURE THE IMPORTANT RIGHTS. PROVIDED BY THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT THE CC PA. CAN BE ENFORCED. AND THEREFORE ENJOYED BY THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA. PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION HAVE ALWAYS BEEN PRIORITIES FOR ME I THINK IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF DEMOCRACY. AND CERTAINLY IT IS EMBEDDED IN OUR CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION. AS AN EXPLICIT FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT. I HAVE WORKED THERE FOR TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY FOR DECADES TO MY LEGISLATION IN MY WORK AS CHAIR. ON THIS COMMITTEE -- IN INTRODUCED LEGISLATION AS FAR BACK AS NINETEEN NINETY NINE TO ADDRESS THIS CHALLENGING WORLD IN WHICH WE LIVE TODAY. AS I MENTIONED CALIFORNIA IS AN EXPLICIT CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO PRIVACY IN CALIFORNIA'S OF SPECIFIC CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT ENSHRINED IN OUR CONSTITUTION OVER FORTY YEARS AGO. IN RESPONSE IRONICALLY TO GROWING FEARS THAT THE WIDESPREAD COLLECTING AND STOCKPILING OF PERSONAL INFORMATION WAS ACTUALLY UNDERMINING CALIFORNIANS ABILITY TO CONTROL THEIR OWN INFORMATION. AND LIVES. IT WAS ACTUALLY THEN THE SENATOR WAS. QUESTION. GEORGE MOSCONI. WHO AS A STATE SENATOR FORTY YEARS AGO SAW THE HANDWRITING ON THE WALL IS TECHNOLOGY WAS EMERGING AND THE THREATS TO POTENTIAL PRIVACY BECAME CLEAR? THOSE FEARS SEEM RATHER PRESIDENT TODAY. DESPITE ITS STATUS AS A FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT OUR PRIVACY HAS BEEN UNDER ATTACK IN RECENT SCANDALS SUCH AS CAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA. THE MASSIVE DATA BREACHES OF EQUIFAX AND MARRIOTT IN FACEBOOK AND OTHERS WHICH CONTINUE TO BE REVEALED ON AN ALMOST DAILY BASIS. AND THE TROUBLING COLLECTION OF DATA REVEALED BY THE FLOW áP-SCANDAL PROVIDE THAT OUR PRIVACY IS BECOMING MORE ILLUSORY THAN REAL. LAST YEAR CALIFORNIA TOOK THE FIRST STEP AND TAKING BACK OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY BY PASSING THE CCPA. I APPLAUD THE EFFORTS OF ALL THOSE WHO MADE IT HAPPEN. BUT THE CCP EIGHT AS A CURRENTLY STANDS IS A FIRST STEP A GOOD ONE BUT THE FIRST STEP. IN THE WAKE OF THE ENACTMENT OF THE CCPA THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SENT A LETTER TO THE LEGISLATURE. WARNING THERE THERE WERE SERIOUS OPERABILITY ISSUES WITH THE LAW. RELEVANT HERE THE AGE SHE LAID OUT A SERIES OF FIXES THAT COULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND EFFECTIVELY BOLSTER THE MEAGER ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN THE C. CPA. AGREEING THAT ENFORCEMENT IS KEY AND THAT THE CCP A LACKS PROPER MECHANISMS I HAVE PARTNERED WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO MAKE THESE AMENDMENTS WHICH COMPRISE SB. FIVE SIXTY ONE AND I WILL BE CLEAR. THESE ARE AMENDMENTS SOUGHT BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN ORDER TO MAKE THIS. IMPORTANT MEASURE ENFORCEABLE FOR THE PEOPLE. THERE ARE THREE MAIN PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. THE FIRST OPERATES ON THE PREMISE THAT A RIGHT WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NO RIGHT AT ALL. THE FIRST THING SB FIVE SIXTY ONE DOES IS A FORD CONSUMERS ACCESS TO JUSTICE BY PROVIDING THEM THE ABILITY TO VINDICATE THEIR OWN RIGHTS THROUGH CIVIL ACTIONS FOR ALL VIOLATIONS OF THE CCPA. CURRENTLY CONSUMERS CAN ONLY ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS IN RESPONSE TO ANARROW SUBSET OF DATA BREACHES. THIS BILL EXPANDS THE CONSUMER ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM SO THAT CONSUMERS CAN HOLD BUSINESSES ACCOUNTABLE WHEN THEY VIOLATE THIS LAW AND OUR RIGHT TO PRIVACY. SB FIVE SIXTY ONE ENSURES THAT THE RIGHTS CREATED BY THE SHE SHE PA ARE MEANINGFUL BY AUTHORIZING CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE TO TAKE CONTROL RATHER THAN ALLOWING ONLY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO FIGHT FOR THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF OVER FORTY MILLION PEOPLE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. EXAMPLE IF A BUSINESS IS COLLECTING AND SELLING THE PERSONAL INFORMATION OF A YOUNG CHILD WITHOUT THE PARENT OR GUARDIAN'S CONSENT THE CHILD AND THE CHILD'S PARENT OR GUARDIAN ARE CURRENTLY WITHOUT A REMEDY. UNDER THE SEA CPA EVEN THOUGH IT IS A CLEAR VIOLATION OF THAT LAW. SB FIVE SIXTY ONE ATTEMPTS TO ADDRESS THAT. NUMBER. TWO SB FIVE SIXTY ONE ELIMINATES THE ABILITY OF BUSINESSES THAT VIOLATE THE CCPA TO AVOID ACCOUNTABILITY BY REMOVING THE THIRTY DAY RIGHT TO CARE PROVISION THAT WOULD EFFECTIVELY HINDER. THE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT -- AS HE IS NOW DESIGNATED A TO DO THIS GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD WOULD ALLOW BUSINESSES TO SYSTEMATICALLY VIOLATE THE LAW WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THEY COULD AVOID BEING HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY CURING THE VIOLATION. IF AND WHEN THE AG AND COVERED THEIR MALFEASANCE. THIS BILL PLUGS THAT ENFORCEMENT LOSE BLUE POLL. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE BILL DOES NOT IMPLICATE THE RIGHT TO CURE PROVISION ATTACHED TO THE CONSUMER ENFORCEMENT. MECHANISM IN THE C. CPA. FINALLY SB FIVE SIXTY ONE PROTECTS TAXPAYERS FROM THE BURDEN OF PROVIDING LEGAL ADVICE TO ANY BUSINESS THAT WANTS IT AND INSTEAD AUTHORIZES THE AG TO PUBLISH GENERAL GUIDELINES. ON COMPLYING WITH THE CC PA TO BENEFIT ALL BUSINESSES AND THIRD PARTIES. CURRENTLY THIS POORLY DRAFTED PROVISION COULD BE INTERPRETED TO REQUIRE THE AG TO ACT AS EVERY BUSINESSES PERSONAL LEGAL COUNSEL. OFFERING ON DEMAND LEGAL SERVICES FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO PRIVATE ENTITIES INCLUDING LARGE CORPORATIONS LIKE GOOGLE LIKE AMAZON LIKE FACEBOOK WHICH HAVE THEIR OWN STABLE OF HUNDREDS OF LAWYERS RIGHT THERE ON STAFF TO SAY NOTHING. OF THEIR ABILITY TO GO OUT AND HIRE MAJOR LAW FIRMS REALLY DOES IN FACT MEAN THAT THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE PICKING UP THE TAB. IT'S UNPRECEDENTED AND A DRAIN ON TAXPAYER FUNDS. SB FIVE SIXTY ONE AVOIDS THIS QUAGMIRE. NUMEROUS INTEREST GROUPS ARE EYEING THE CCP A WITH AN INTERESTING DILUTING ITS IMPACT. MOST HAVE VERY PARTICULAR ASKS THAT CATER TO THEIR SPECIFIC INTERESTS. SOME SEEKING A COMPLETE EXEMPTION. FROM CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE LAW FOR THEIR PARTICULAR INDUSTRY BUT OTHERS SIMPLY SEEK CLARITY WHICH CAN BE FAIR AND REASONABLE. AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY SENSIBLE CHANGES THAT CAN BE MADE TO CLEAN UP THE STATUTE AND MAKE THE PATH TO COMPLIANCE A SMOOTHER. ONE THE STORIES ABOUT THE STEALTH THE COLLECTION OF DATA FROM APPS AND HOUSEHOLD PRODUCTS IN THE MISUSE OF THAT DATA INCLUDING THAT OF CHILDREN ARE HORRIFYING TO PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS. AND PROBABLY TO EACH OF US. AND MAKE ME WARY THAT THERE ARE TOO MANY BUSINESSES THAT HAVE NOT LEARNED THEIR LESSON AND THAT SELF REGULATION CAN NO LONGER BE THE MODEL. IN FACT EVEN FACEBOOK HAS ACKNOWLEDGED. THAT A IT'S TIME FOR US TO REGULATE THEM MORE THOROUGHLY THAT THEY ARE NEEDING THAT REGULATION AND ACTUALLY ASKING FOR IT. CLAIMS THE REGULATION OF DATA COLLECTION AND ENFORCEMENT OF SUCH LAWS WILL STIFLE INNOVATION ARE TRULY TIRESOME AND GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRY'S THEMSELVES ARE SAYING THEY NEED MORE DIRECTION I E. REGULATION. WE MUST PROCEED. AND MY RESPONSE IS WE WANT TO INNOVATE NOT VIOLATE. IT IS THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT TO ASSURE THE PROFIT DOES NOT COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE VALUES AND PRIORITIES OF THE PEOPLE WE REPRESENT. THE STATUS QUO IS LARGE COMPANY SYSTEMATICALLY COLLECTING CONSUMER DATA WITHOUT ADEQUATE DISCLOSURE OR CONSENT. HE PRIVACY IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH YOUR BUSINESS MODEL THEN IT IS TIME TO INNOVATE AND IF YOU PARTICIPATED. IN THE HE INTO INFORMATION HEARING THAT WE HAD JUST A FEW WEEKS AGO WE HAD PEOPLE COME FORWARD WHO FOR WHOM PRIOR -- PRIVACY IS OUR TOP PRIORITY AND HOW THEY HAVE BEEN ABLE TO INNOVATE AND CREATE OPERATE. COMPANIES THAT PROMISE PRIVACY AND THAT THEIR COMPANIES ARE FLOURISHING. IT IS POSSIBLE IT IS DOABLE AND WITH CONSTITUTIONAL A CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT IT IS MANDATORY THAT WE PROCEED TO PROTECT OUR PRIVACY RIGHT. AND WHILE ADVANCES IN TECHNOLOGY SHOULD BE FOSTERED AS THEY BRING GREAT BENEFIT TO SOCIETY THERE'S NO ARGUMENT THERE. SOMETIMES IT IS THE GOVERNMENT THAT NEEDS TO STEP IN AND ENSURE THAT THE VALUES OF THE PEOPLE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS WE DO PROGRESS. I BELIEVE THE CHANGES MADE TO THE CCPA BY THIS BILL ARE CHANGES ONLY TO THE USUAL OF ENFORCEMENT AND DO NOT AFFECT THE LAW AS IT IS CURRENTLY CONSTITUTED. AND I THINK THAT'S IMPORTANT I DON'T PARTICULARLY AGREE WITH ALL OF THE PROVISIONS WITH IN THE C. C. PA. BUT THAT WAS SOMETHING THAT WAS -- AGREED -- TO BUT IT'S NOT ENFORCEABLE. IN ITS CURRENT FORM. AND SO I'M OPEN TO AND I KNOW THERE HAVE BEEN CONVERSATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN TAKING PLACE BUT I WILL TELL YOU. THAT THERE ARE BETWEEN EIGHTEEN AND TWENTY FIVE OR MORE BILLS CURRENTLY IN THIS LEGISLATURE TO TRY TO CHANGE THE IMPLEMENTATION EXCUSE ME CHANGE THE SUBSTANCE. OF THE CCPA THIS BILL IS ONLY TRYING TO ASSURE THAT WE CAN ENFORCE. THAT MEASURE. AND WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE -- TO INVITE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE -- TO TO SPEAK TO THE SUBSTANCE OF THE BILL AND I BELIEVE THAT THE CHANGES WE MAKE TO THIS BILL WILL SIMPLY ALLOW CALIFORNIANS TO TAKE BACK CONTROL OF OUR PRIVACY. AND UNTIE THE HANDS OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN MAKING THESE LIGHTS GLORIA. EXCUSE ME THESE RIGHTS REAL AND WITH THAT -- I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. HI IF YOU COULD INTRODUCE YOURSELF -- IN PLEASE THE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES AND WE'LL HAVE -- TO ADVOCACY SPEAKERS ON THE SUBJECT. OKAY QUICKLY -- MY NAME IS ANTHONY LEAD ON WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AM WE APPRECIATIVE TO SENATE JACKSON FOR DEMONSTRATING LEADERSHIP. AND PRIVACY ISSUES ON OUR SHARED COMMITMENT. IN PROTECTING CONSUMER PRIVACY IN THE GOALS OF THE CCPA. WHILE THE CCPA PROVIDES A GROUNDBREAKING PROTECTIONS FOR CONSUMERS THAT ALSO IMPOSES SERIOUS WORK ABILITY. AN OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES ON THE AG'S OFFICE. THESE CHALLENGES MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO CARRY OUT. OUR OVERSIGHT ENFORCEMENT DUTIES UNDER THE CCP A THREE PLEASE A SPONSOR THIS BILL WHICH WILL ADDRESS THESE WORKABILITY IN OPERATION CONCERNS. FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AND LIKE. TO NOTE THAT STACY SENSOR FROM OUR OFFICE IS HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND TECHNICAL. QUESTIONS YOU MIGHT HAVE ABOUT THE BILL THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. JERRY MEMBERS MIKE MATICA CONSUMER WATCHDOG ACCOUNTS FOR CONSUMER WATCHDOG AND THE VICE PRESIDENT NATIONAL GUARD ASSOCIATION JUST WANNA MAKE THREE QUICK POINTS IN SUPPORT. OF THE SB FIVE SIX ONE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- FIRST THE CONSUMERS RIGHT TO SUE IT TO RECOVER DAMAGES -- FOR AN AN AUTHORIZED BREACH. AND AND WHERE THE BUSINESS FAILED. TO TAKE REASONABLE STEPS TO PROTECT THAT THAT'S THE FIRST ONE THE RIGHT TO SUE SECOND. THIS BILL CLOSES A LOOPHOLE THAT ALLOWED BUSINESS TO DELAY ACCOUNTABILITY THAT'S THAT. THIRTY DAY CARE PREVENTION. AND THIRD THIS BILL AUTHORIZES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO ISSUE FOR PUBLISHED GENERAL GUIDANCE AND GUIDELINES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH THE C. CPA. JUST LIKE OTHER REGULATORY ENTITIES -- THIS LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER GOD FORBID THE IRS. AND SO WE ASK YOU TO JUST SUPPORT THIS -- SUPPORT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND VOTE ON THIS MEASURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. WITH THAT -- THIS TO BE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR INDIVIDUALS MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC -- TO COME FORWARD TO THE MICROPHONE -- FOR THOSE WHO ARE IN SUPPORT IF YOU COULD PLEASE -- LET US KNOW YOUR AFFILIATION STATE YOUR NAME. HELLO I'M NANCY TRAVEL CEO OF CONSUMER ATTORNEYS OF CALIFORNIA AND WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE AUTHOR IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND WANTING TO MOVE FORWARD AND WORK ON THIS BILL. TO STRENGTHEN THE PRIVACY LEGISLATION I'M SURE THERE WILL BE AMPLE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS. THE DETAILS OF IT AS IT MOVES ALONG BUT WE DO THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS TO BE ABLE. PARTICULARLY FOR IMPORTANT VIOLATIONS TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THEIR OWN RIGHTS THANK YOU. SAMANTHA CORBIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LOW INCOME CONSUMERS COALITION IN SUPPORT. IN ADDITION I'M THE POINT OF CONTACT FOR COALITION OF FOURTEEN PRIVACY ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING THE AFFECT THE ACLU AND PRIVACY RIGHTS CLEARING HOUSE WHO ARE COMMITTED TO BOTH PRESERVING AND STRENGTHENING. OUR THREE SEVEN FIVE AS IT WAS WRITTEN LAST YEAR UNFORTUNATELY AS MANY OF YOU ARE FAMILIAR WITH OUR INITIATIVE PROCESS AT THIS TIME IS FAIRLY EXTORT OF AND SO WHAT WE DO CONSIDER. THREE SEVEN FIVE A STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION -- WE DO SUPPORT THIS EFFORT TO ENSURE CONSUMERS CAN PROTECT THE RIGHTS WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHING OTHER BILLS IN THIS AREA SO WE ENCOURAGE OUR I DON'T THINK. SURE MEMBERS KEVIN BACON AMERICAN CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION OF CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY THINK IT SHOULD BE STRONGER -- AND YET -- I WANTED TO INFORM YOU THAT WE'VE RECENTLY DONE SOME POLLING THAT YOU MAY HAVE HEARD ABOUT ON THIS ISSUE -- AND FOUND THAT ACROSS THE BOARD UP AND DOWN THE STATE WHETHER IT'S URBAN ANDRURAL WOMEN PEOPLE OF COLOR -- ORANGE COUNTY GREAT AT CENTRAL VALLEY -- URBAN AREAS -- WE'VE GOT 94% SUPPORT FOR THE VERY QUESTION PRESENTED BY THIS BILL WHICH IS SHOULD CONSUMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO ENFORCE ON PRIVACY VIOLATIONS THAT OCCUR TO THEM PERSONALLY -- SO WHAT IS YOUR THAT INFORMATION WILL BE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THIS BILL -- BUT WE ARE SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT OF ALLOWING CONSUMERS -- TO TO ENFORCE THE MOST PERSONAL OF RIGHTS THANK YOU. DANIEL GOOD TEARS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. MAUREEN MAHONEY ON BEHALF OF CONSUMER REPORTS AND THE MORE THAN TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS THAT WE REPRESENT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL. THE CALIFORNIA CONSUMER PRIVACY ACT ESTABLISHED IMPORTANT PRIVACY PROVISIONS -- BUT WE TOOK A SUPPORT OF AMENDED POSITION ON THE LEGISLATION IN LARGE PART BECAUSE IT'S WEAK ENFORCEMENT PROVISIONS. MEANINGFUL ENFORCEMENT IS ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE THE COMPANY'S COMPLY WITH THE LAW THIS BILL WOULD ENSURE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS AT A TIME WHEN PRIVACY. IS MOST UNDER THREAT AND WE THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT THANK YOU ANY OTHER MEMBERS THE PUBLIC OR INDIVIDUALS REPRESENTING ORGANIZATIONS -- WHICH TO MAKE A STATEMENT. ADVOCATING FOR THIS LEGISLATION. SEEING NONE -- THIS TO BE THE OPPORTUNITY -- FOR TWO WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION IF WE COULD -- MAKE -- AT LEAST ONE OF THE SEATS AVAILABLE. THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE IT. AND IF YOU COULD -- PLEASE KEEP YOUR COMMENTS TO TWO MINUTES INTRODUCED YOURSELF AND YOUR AFFILIATION [inaudible] THANK YOU. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS SERIBU WITH CAL CHAMBER TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION. THERE'S NO DOUBT THE CCPA WILL BE A CHALLENGING Là TO IMPLEMENT BOTH FOR THE AG AND FOR BUSINESS BUSINESSES WILL SPEND A FORTUNE TO COMPLY WITH THESE NEW RIGHTS AND WE'RE DEALING WITH A MOVING TARGET. COMPLIANCE STARTS JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR BUT REGULATIONS WILL NOT LIKELY BE FINISHED UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER THAT AND THEN BUSINESSES REALLY DON'T HAVE A REALISTIC TIME FRAME TO COMPLY. THERE AFTER. PLUS THE CCPA NEED STATUTORY CLARIFICATIONS AND SOME AMENDMENTS TO ADDRESS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES AND WE'VE BEEN WORKING HARD TO PUT FORTH REASONABLE PROPOSALS THAT WILL NOT ROLL BACK ANY OF THE RIGHTS THAT EVERYBODY AGREED. TO AND THAT'S KEY. AND NOW HERE WITH SB FIVE SIXTY ONE SLOT THIS BILL WOULD ROLL BACK THE MOST CRITICAL AGREEMENT LEADING TO THE C. CPA THIS COMPLEX NEW LAW WOULD BE ENFORCED BY A REGULATOR. LIKE ITS EUROPEAN COUNTERPART THE GPR. INSTEAD SB FIVE SIXTY ONE WOULD ALLOW THOUSANDS OF TRIAL ATTORNEYS TEST BUSINESSES ABILITY TO PERFECTLY COMPLY WITH THE COMPLEXITIES OF THIS NEW LAW. THIS WILL BE STRICT LIABILITY WITH NO PROOF OF INJURY EVEN FOR REASONABLE DIFFERENCES IN INTERPRETATION OF A LAW THAT CAN BE VAGUE AND AMBIGUOUS. PRIVACY EXPERTS DISAGREE OVER CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THIS LINE ALLOWING A FLOOD OF CLASS ACTION LITIGATION ON TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS IS NOT THE WAY TO GET CLARITY OR COMPLIANCE IS A SIGNIFICANT UNFAIR BURDEN ON BUSINESSES. OUT ALSO NOTE THE CCPA ALREADY PROVIDES AN AGGRESSIVE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- FOR BUT THE THE DATA SECURITY PROVISIONS OF THE LAW SO WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HERE TODAY ARE THE PRIVACY PROVISIONS OF THIS LAW AND YOU HAVE TO REMEMBER. THE CCPA APPLIES TO BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES ACROSS EVERY INDUSTRY IT'S GOING TO APPLY TO SMALL BUSINESSES LIKE CAFES PIZZERIAS THEY HAVE HIGH TRAFFIC. THE THEY USE CREDIT CARDS. ARE PEOPLE LIKE TO ORDER ONLINE SO THEY'RE GONNA HIT THIS THRESHOLD SB FIVE SIXTY ONE ALSO RULES BACK BUSINESSES RIGHT TO SEEK GUIDANCE IT ROLLS BACK THERE RIGHT. TO CURE IT IN CASE OUR GOOD FAITH EFFORTS TO COMPLY WITH THE MANY NUANCES OF THE CCPA FALL SHORT AND BY THE WAY. BUSINESS OWNERS ARE NOT CRIMINALS LOOKING FOR A GET OUT OF JAIL FREE CARD THEY'RE DECENT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO BE GENUINELY OVERWHELMED BY THE COMPLEXITY AND THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CZ PA. IN EUROPE DATA REGULATORS OFFER GUIDANCE THEY CONDUCT AUDITS THE ISSUE WARNINGS IN THE ISSUE FINES THEIR FOCUS IS ON COMPLIANCE AND THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE HERE ESPECIALLY SINCE THAT WAS ALREADY AGREED. TO MEMBERS WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MY NAME IS DOMINIQUE SHELTON LEIPZIG AND I AM APARTNER PERKINS COOLEY I AM ONE OF THE LEADERS OF OUR FIRM'S. GLOBAL PRIVACY AND DATA SECURITY PRACTICE. AND I TRAIN MORE THAN FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUSINESS EXECUTIVES ON THE C. CPA. BUSINESSES WANT TO COMPLY THEIR INCONSISTENCIES IN THE STATUTE HOWEVER THAT CREATE CHALLENGES FOR BUSINESSES THAT LEGISLATORS MAY NEVER HAVE INTENDED AND SHOULD NOT EXPOSE THEM TO RUINOUS CLASS ACTIONS. TO CRYSTALLIZE THIS POINT THERE THESE ARE JUST TWO EXAMPLES RELATING TO THE C. C. P.'S INCLUSION OF HOUSEHOLDS IN THE DEFINITION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION -- LIVING ARRANGEMENTS LOW INCOME CALIFORNIANS ARE INCREASINGLY ENTERING INTO CO LIVING ARRANGEMENTS DUE TO A LACK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WEDNESDAY REMADE REQUEST ACCESS TO PERSONAL INFORMATION SHOULD THE BUSINESS PRODUCED THE ENTIRE HOUSEHOLD INFORMATION. LET'S TALK ABOUT DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. AS A PAST PRESIDENT OF WOMEN LAWYERS ASSOCIATION OF LOS ANGELES WHICH HAS THE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE PROJECT. I PARTICULARLY SENSITIVE TO THIS POINT. IN IF AN ABUSER A SUSPECT THE SPOUSAL FLEET TO A SAFE SPACE I REQUEST ACCESS TO THE HOUSEHOLD INTERNET SEARCHES. SHOULD THE BUSINESS PROVIDE THIS. THESE ARE THE TYPES OF CHALLENGES THAT MANY BUSINESSES ARE FACING RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MYRIAD OTHER EXAMPLES OF INCONSISTENT PROVISIONS WITHIN THE STATUTE. AN AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS THAT NEED TO BE WORKED THROUGH. AMBIGUOUS PROVISIONS WITH INCREASED PENALTIES OF AND LITIGATION REST WILL NOT HELP CONSUMERS OR BUSINESSES AS THEY GRAPPLE WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THE COMPLAINTS OF CULTURE THAT WE'VE TRYING TO CREATE. LET'S FOLLOW THE E. U.'S LEAD. E. YOU REGULATORS HAVE ISSUED WARNINGS GUIDANCE AND CONDUCTED AUDIT. NOT OPEN THE DOOR TO RUINOUS CLASS ACTIONS TO BUSINESS. AS ESPECIALLY AS BUSINESSES ARE LEGITIMATELY ATTEMPTING TO NAVIGATE THROUGH THESE TOUGH-ISSUES. A COMPLIANCE CULTURE LIKE THE ONE IN THE E. U.. IS NEEDED HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO GIVE US TIME TO ADDRESS UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES LIKE THE ONES I OUTLINED. WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET THE CCPA RIGHT THIS TIME.

I'M GONNA BRING BACK -- OVER TO THE THE DAIS -- SYNDROME BURDEN. THANK YOU IT WHICH TO SPEAK SIR THANK THANK YOU MISTER -- BENJAMIN FIRST ALL THANK YOU FOR YOUR FLEXIBILITY YOU AND I'VE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO WORK TOGETHER ON THIS I THINK THAT THERE'S A CONSENSUS THAT. OF WHATEVER WAS DONE NEXT YEAR THERE LAST YEAR RATHER IT WASN'T COMPLETED NEEDS TO BE. SOME FIXES IF YOU WILL -- A COUPLE OF CONCERNS -- ONE IS WITH RESPECT TO THE CURE THAT'S PROVIDED BEFORE SOMEONE CAN EXERCISE THEIR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. CONCERN IS IS THAT THAT'S NOT DEFINED WHAT WHAT DOES THE CURE MEAN WHAT. STANDARD DOES SOMEONE NEED TO MEET. TO ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE CURE ARE. AS IT WERE MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A MORASS IS GONNA BE. A DONNYBROOK IN TERMS OF OF LITIGATION IN THAT DEFINITION SO THAT'S ITEM ONE AND THEN ITEM TO WE COULD TALK ABOUT. AN OVERALL AT THE THE LARGER POINT OVERALL ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. WELL PART OF WHAT THE BILL DOES IS IT TAKES AWAY. THE RIGHT TO CURE A FEW WILL BECAUSE OF THAT DOES CREATE SOME CHALLENGES -- OR AT LEAST IT TAKES AWAY FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAVING. TO GIVE LEGAL ADVICE AND THEN GIVE THEM THIRTY DAYS RIGHT TO CARE AND THEN TO SUE THEM I MEAN IT'S KIND OF LIKE. BEING C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; MADE AND BOTTLE&lt;/c&gt;</u> WASHER ALL THE SAME AND THAT WON'T WORK -- LET ME ADD A DEFERRED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE AS TO HOW THEY UNDERSTAND WHAT CURE MEANS BUT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO GET RID OF THAT CONCEPT BECAUSE MEMBER IN. THAT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS CREATING THE REGULATIONS OF THIS NOTION THAT THIS IS THE WILD WEST THEN THERE'S NOT GONNA BE. ANY DEFINITIONS ANY RULES IS JUST NOT ACCURATE THERE IS IN FACT IN THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THINGS ALREADY KILLED SEVEN OR EIGHT DIFFERENT HEARINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO TRY TO GIVE GUIDANCE THROUGH THE REGULATORY HE IS THE REGULATOR HE IS. OR BEEN TASKED TO BE THE REGULATOR AND SO HE HAS -- IS IN THE PROCESS OF CREATING THE REGULATIONS AS THE GUIDES FOR WHAT -- BUSINESSES WHAT THESE COMPANIES ARE SUPPOSED TO DO TO COMPLY WITH THE CCPA SO THAT'S AGAIN THAT'S THE JOB THAT HE HAS. BEEN TASKED WITH THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE JOB THAT HE IS IN THE PROCESS NOW OF COMPLETING. SO THERE WILL BE GUIDANCE IN TH END IT WILL BE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BASED UPON THE SHE SHOULD BE A WHO WILL DEVELOP THOSE. GUIDELINES -- AS FAR AS THE RIGHT TO CURE -- I AM. NOT FAMILIAR WITH ANY -- OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS BECAUSE WE WE AGREE THAT IT'S DID THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO CREATE -- FAR TOO MUCH CONFUSION AND THEN. IF A LAWSUIT IS FILED THE COMPANIES A COMMITTEE WHERE WE COMPLIED WITH YOUR RIGHT TO CURE I MEAN WE'RE GOING TO END UP. BANGING OUR HEADS AGAINST THE SAME WALL OVER AND OVER AGAIN SECURE IT TO TAKING AWAY THAT QUOTE UNQUOTE RIGHT TO CURE AFTER THE REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN ISSUED JUSTICE. IS JUST NOT A REALISTIC APPROACH THERE WILL BE REGULATIONS OF PEOPLE WILL BE THE COMPANIES WILL BE EXPECTED TO TO FOLLOW AND I ANTICIPATE THAT THEY'LL BE FAIRLY CLEAR AND IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS. BE FURTHER DISCUSSION TO TRY. TO CREATE A SYSTEM THAT WILL GIVE THE APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE TO THESE COMPANIES BUT RIGHT NOW THERE IS A RIGHT TO CURE. AND SO THE THE QUESTION WOULD BE HOW IS THAT TO FIND IF IF YOU'RE. THE JUDGE HOW DOES ONE DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THERE'S BEEN ADEQUATE COMPLIANCE THERE DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE A STANDARD -- WHETHER IT'S SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WHETHER IT IT IS YOU KNOW ABSOLUTE. THAT THAT'S PART OF THE PROBLEM WITH THE CURRENT STATE OF THE BILL BUT I'LL DEFER TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M STACY SCHEFFLER I'M THE SUPERVISING DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR THE PRIVACY UNIT AT THE AG'S OFFICE. SO LET ME JUST BE CLEAR AND JUST DISCUSS THE RIGHT TO CARE BUT THERE'S A RIGHT TO CARE PROVISION -- REGARDING THE AG'S ENFORCEMENT AND FIVE SIXTY ONE SEEKS TO DELETE THAT LANGUAGE SO THAT THE AG THAT ASIDE I PUTTING THAT ASIDE. GREAT OKAY SO THERE'S AN EXISTING RIGHT TO CURE LANGUAGE AS IT PERTAINS TO THE CIVIL ACTION THAT CAN BE PRIDE AS A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION -- AND THAT SECTION IS IN SECTION OF SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE FIVE OO. THAT LANGUAGES ORIGINALLY IN AB THREE SEVENTY FIVE AND IT SAID THAT -- BEFORE A A CIVIL ACTION CAN PROCEED A CONSUMER NEEDS TO PROVIDE FOR THIRTY DAYS FOR THE BUSINESS TO BE ABLE TO KEEP YOUR BEFORE THEY CAN PROCEED WITH THEIR THEIR ACTION THEY HAVE TO PROVIDE NOTICE AN OPPORTUNITY CARE. THERE ARE OTHER STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT ALREADY PROVIDE FOR THIS TYPE OF OF CURATIVE PROCEDURE TO TO GO FORWARD FOR EXAMPLE THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT WHICH IS ALSO IN THE CIVIL CODE. PROVIDES. FOR A RIGHT TO CURE BEFORE ABOUT CONSUMER PROCEEDS WITH AN ACTION -- REGARDING DAMAGES DAMAGED GOODS OR SERVICES SO IT REQUIRES THIRTY DAYS PRIOR TO FILING A CIVIL CIVIL ACTION FOR DAMAGES A CONSUMER MUST NOTIFY OF AN ALLEGED VIOLATION AND PROVIDE AND DEMAND THAT THERE BE A CORRECTION AND REPAIR REPLACEMENT OR OTHER REMEDY AND THAT'S THAT'S CONTAINED IN THE LANGUAGE REGARDING. THE CONSUMER LEGAL REMEDIES ACT THERE'S ALSO A CURATIVE PROVISION IN THIS FINAL LIGHT LOSS OF A COULD SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT. EIGHTY FOUR IF A BUSINESS PROVIDES INCOMPLETE OR INACCURATE INFORMATION OR DOES NOT PROVIDE TIMELY INFORMATION -- THEY HAVE NAY THEY HAVE NINETY DAYS IN ORDER -- TO TO CURE THAT ARE PROVIDE INFORMATION THAT THEY HAVE FAILED TO PROVIDE OR TAX OR PROVIDED WITHIN THE TIME GOING FORWARD. THERE ARE OTHER PROVISIONS THAT -- WITHIN THE CIVIL CODE -- REGARDING A RIGHT TO CARE FOR EXAMPLE. CIVIL CODE SECTION FIFTY FIVE POINT FIFTY SIX ENUMERATE THAT TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS OF THE ADA FOR EXAMPLE THAT BEFORE A SMALL BUSINESS -- CAN. BE SUED FOR A VIOLATION OF THE ADA FOR TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS THEY HAVE TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CORRECT WITHIN FIFTEEN DAYS SO THERE AND THERE'S OTHER EXAMPLES TO HAPPY TO DISCUSS FURTHER. ILLUSTRATE MY POINT MY POINT IS IS THAT THERE'S AN ISSUE HERE YOU SAID THAT THERE'S AT LEAST THREE DEFINITIONS FOR CURE. AND SO FOR BUSINESS TO MEET WHATEVER STANDARD THAT EMBODY HERE AND I GET IT IT WAS THE BILL THAT WAS PASSED LAST YEAR. I WAS IN HERE BUT FOR SOMEONE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY IN THE CURE THEY NEED TO KNOW WHAT THE STANDARD MIGHT BE. AND THEY NEED TO KNOW. YOU KNOW IT IN ESSENCE HOW MUCH TIME AND I I THINK I GOT THE THIRTY DAYS IN HERE. BUT WHAT DOES THAT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IN TERMS OF WHAT THEY NEED TO DO SO I I WOULD. SUGGEST THAT THE THAT THERE NEEDS TO BE AT THE VERY LEAST. A FURTHER DEFINITION OF CURE ANY STANDARD THAT THE JUDGE CAN EMPLOY. SO WHEN WHEN SHE LOOKS AT THIS SHE CAN SAY YES THEY HAVE MET. SUBSTANTIALLY. AND I THINK SENATOR AND APPRECIATED REFERRING TO THE JUDGES SHE I DID CATCH THAT -- DAY WHEN THEY WHEN THEY ARE AYE ONE IS FINE -- BUT I THINK ONCE WE GET THE REGULATIONS. WILL BE ABLE THEN TO PUT THE TO DEFINE RIGHT TO CURE BECAUSE RIGHT NOW WE DON'T EVEN IF REGULATIONS AS TO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO BE COMPLYING BUT I DO AGREE I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT POINT. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT. THAT THAT WILL IN FACT. BE CLEAR ENOUGH BECAUSE IF THE IF THERE IS FOUNDER PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION RIGHT TO CURE -- IT IT HAS TO HAVE SOME PARAMETERS TO IT RIGHT NOW THERE AREN'T ANY PARAMETERS BECAUSE OF THE THE AG IS STUCK CHILLS PUTTING THESE REGULATIONS TOGETHER. SO PUTTING THAT ASIDE OF PERHAPS WE COULD HAVE OUR ANOTHER MEMBER THE AG'S OFFICE HAVE A SENATOR -- I THINK THE THE DIFFERENT EXAMPLES OF READY CARE WHERE THEY EXIST IN THE LAW WE RESEARCH THEM AND JUST TO SEE THE RANGE. OF HOW THIS ISSUES APPROACHED IN VARIOUS PLACES REPAIRS ON THE LINE NOW. AND AND IT PROVIDES A BASIS FOR DISCUSSING IN FINE TUNING THIS FURTHER I THINK WHAT WE SEE IS FOR EXAMPLE IN. SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO THE RECORD SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO YOU HAVE AN APPROACH WHERE THEY DEFINED HERE AS AN APPROPRIATE CORRECTION REPAIR REPLACEMENT OR OTHER REMEDY. THEY TRY TO DEFINE AND WORD FROM THAT THE IN IN IN A DIFFERENT SECTION -- FOR EXAMPLE IN THE LABOR CODE -- THEY TAKEN APPROACH OF PROCEDURAL A PROCEDURAL APPROACH THAT WILL IN TO ME IT SEEMS LIKE [inaudible] THE COULD. WORD SMITH MAYBE WE DIRECTLY WHAT CURE MEANS CURE MEANS ONE THING TO ANOTHER PERSON BUT BY CREATING GREATER DUE PROCESS AROUND THIS PROCEDURE WHERE IF YOU. HAVE A DISPUTE OVER WHETHER SOMETHING IS CURATOR NOT FRIED YOU ADDITIONAL PROCEDURES. AND DUE PROCESS INTO GETTING TO A RESOLUTION THERE THAT WAY. NO ONE IS AND FAIRLY HARMED BY A WHAT I GET ALL THAT I I GET THAT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS PROVIDE A MECHANISM SO THAT BUSINESSES YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME OF THE ADA SO THAT BUSINESSES ARE UNFAIRLY SORT OF BOTH FETTERED AND AFFECTED BY. BY THIS LAW MY CONCERN IS THOUGH IS IMMATURITY CREATES ALL SORTS OF CHALLENGES AND SO. LET ME LET ME JUST PUT THAT ASIDE FOR A SECOND I THINK THE MANAGER THANK YOU YOU ALREADY AGREE THAT THAT'S AN ISSUE. AND I AND I'M NOT SURE REGULATIONS QUITE RESOLVE IT A COURTS CONNECT APPLIES THE SECOND QUESTION IS IN THIS IS -- TO THE THE FOLKS IN THE AG'S OFFICE IS THAT THERE IS ANOTHER MECHANISM FOR ENFORCEMENT AND NOW IT MAY BE ANALOGOUS IN THE MECHANISM AND THAT'S IN BUSINESS PROFESSIONS CODES. SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHERE A PUBLIC OFFICIAL IS EITHER. AUTHORIZED OR DELEGATED THE RESPONSIBILITY TO BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE LAW AND I TAKE THE POINT THAT YOU KNOW A RIGHT WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NOT REALLY A RIGHT. SO TO THE EXTENT THAT THAT -- SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED I THINK IT HAS BEEN WORKABLE -- A TO BE INTERESTED IN YOUR POINT OF VIEW ON THAT AND SO ANOTHER WORDS NOT IN ADDITION TO BUT FOR EXAMPLE. REMOVING THE INDIVIDUAL. PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IN IN ESSENCE HAVING A CITY ATTORNEY COUNTY ATTORNEY A DISTRICT ATTORNEY OF COURSE INCLUDING THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE. BE ABLE TO ENFORCE THE ENFORCE THE LAW. AS IN FORCING THIS EASY PAY AS A PREDICATE UNDER THE UNDER THE UC OUT IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE YOU'RE REQUESTING. I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU MEAN BY AS A PREDICATE THE U. C. L. IS A CONSUMER PROTECTION STATUTE THE UNFAIR COMPETITION LAW IT NO NO SEPARATE DEPARTMENT JUST USING THAT. BY INCORPORATING SOMETHING BY ANALOGY INTO THIS LAW. SEN OTHER WORDS RATHER THAN YOU KNOW STRIKING THE BE PORTION HERE WHERE IT SAYS THAT -- PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION -- THE CONSUMER MAY BE IN ESSENCE BRING AN ACTION. IN THEIR INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY. IN INSTEAD HAVING [inaudible] THAT. PROVISION OR THAT FORCING MECHANISM BE ANALOGOUS NOT EXACTLY BUT ANALOGOUS TO THE ENFORCER REVISIONS AND SEVEN BUSINESS PROFESSIONAL CODE. SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED SO IF I THINK I'M UNDERSTANDING IS IT'S TO LOOK AT PROVIDING A SIMILAR FORSMAN MECHANISM THAT'S IN THE BUSINESS IN CODE. PROFESSIONS BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS CODE SEVENTEEN TOOL FOR RIGHT RIGHT TO LOOK AT THAT LANGUAGE TO FIX RIGHT -- AND I WOULD SAY -- WE STARTED TO LOOK AT THAT AND WE'RE HAPPY TO ON FOR THE LIKE THE AND AND AND BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND WE'RE COMMITTED TO ENGAGING FURTHER DISCUSSIONS DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU. CORRECT ARE POTENTIALLY EXPANDING THE YOU KNOW THE PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT. FOR OTHER SEVENTEEN TO VOTE FOR I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT CREATING A NOTHER. ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM I'M TALKING ABOUT. THAT AGAIN CREATING AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. IN LIEU OF THAT'S RUN THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M REFERRING. TO THIS SO I AM AS I UNDERSTAND BECAUSE WE'VE HAD THIS DISCUSSION AND I BELIEVE ALSO WITH THE SENATOR ALLEN. LOOKING AT AN EXISTING MECHANISM LIKE SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHICH WE DO USE AND CONSUMER -- AREAS AS A AN OVERLAY FOR OF AN ALTERNATIVE FORM OF ENFORCEMENT OTHER THAN A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. RIGHT EXACTLY MET AND IN DECIDED SAID AND I AND I'VE TALKED TO THE ATTORNEY GENERAL ABOUT THIS DIRECTLY HE IS PREPARED TO CONTINUE PURSUING THIS AS AN AVENUE. AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN HAVE THAT WE HAVE. ADEQUATE ENFORCEMENT OF THIS LAW SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED MAY VERY WELL BE -- THE BEST APPROACH -- GIVEN I KNOW CONCERNED SHOULD HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED AND I AM COMMITTED NEED SHE IS COMMITTED. TO TO PURSUING -- DISCUSSIONS THAT THAT -- REFLECT THAT -- THAT INTEREST IN IT IT MAY VERY WELL BE A A VIABLE APPROACH TO TAKE IF WE KEEP IF WE'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IF THERE IS A IF THERE IS DEEP CONCERN ABOUT. ABOUT THAT GOING FORWARD IN SPITE OF ALL OF THE YOU KNOW THE OF PRE CONDITIONS SUCH AS THE REGULATIONS AND SO FORTH THE THE NOTION I KNOW THAT -- US IN THE COMING YEAR WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE SMALL BUSINESS PERSON AND I THINK THOSE ARE ALSO LEGITIMATE CONCERNS THAT WE NEED TO FLESH OUT BECAUSE THE GOAL ISN'T TO GO. I ALWAYS ENJOY WHEN THE CHAMBER COMES IN AND SAYS WHAT ABOUT THE GUY WANTS A PIZZERIA. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE GUY WANTS FACEBOOK WE'RE TALKING ABOUT HOW PEOPLE WITH LOTS OF MONEY HERE WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THE LITTLE GUY AND WE'RE NOT INTENDING TO CATCH THE LITTLE GUY WHAT WE WANT TO DO. IS MAKE SURE THAT -- THAT THE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. IS SUCCESSFULLY -- SUPPORTING THE C. CPA'S INTENT AND IT'S RISK YOU KNOW WHEN ITS OBLIGATIONS AND PROTECTING MOST IMPORTANTLY. PEOPLE'S RIGHT TO PRIVACY SO WHY HI I THINK THAT THIS IS OF A VERY. LEGITIMATE -- AREA THAT WE SHOULD BE AND WHAT I WILL COMMIT TO EXPLORING THAT OF GOING FORWARD. BY IT IF WE ARE ABLE TO CONTINUE MOVING THE BILL AND ALSO -- I HAVE COMMITTED TO THE CENTER COVER GYRO ALSO LOOKING AT THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT GOING AFTER THE PIZZA GUY WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE REALLY TRYING. TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE MAKING LOTS OF MONEY ON THIS -- ARE OF FOLLOWING THE PROVISIONS IN THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SEISHI PA. ON BEHALF OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL BUT THERE HE IS COMMITTED TO ENGAGING AND FURTHER DISCUSSIONS WITH YOU AND POTENTIALLY EXPANDING PUBLIC ENFORCEMENT OF THE CCPA YOUR DA'S AND CITY ATTORNEYS -- OF A CITY WITH AT LEAST A SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PERSON POPULATION AS WELL AS A CITY ATTORNEY OF ANY CITY AND COUNTY. ALL RIGHT. THAT'S BECAUSE LIKE. SEVENTEEN SEVENTEEN ZERO FOUR FOUR A NUMBER DIDN'T IS THAT INCLUDE YOUR THOUGHTS ALL RIGHT -- I WAS GOING TO GO TO CENTER MINING BUT BECAUSE CENTER COVER YOUR WAS REFERENCED. PLANNING WELL I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR BECAUSE WE DID WE'VE HAD A A NUMBER OF CONVERSATIONS AND AND I'VE I'VE ALSO SPOKEN -- WITH THEM EIJI BUT SERRA BUT BUT MY CONCERN IS SMALL BUSINESSES AS WELL AS START UPS I MEAN WE'RE WE'RE VERY INNOVATIVE -- PLACE IT IN A THAT'S I THINK ONE OF OUR STRENGTHS IN TERMS OF THE ECONOMY AND THE LAST THING I'D LIKE TO DO IS -- TO CREATE THIS -- IN. INDECISION AND CONFUSION ABOUT EXACTLY. WHAT WE MEAN BY PRIVACY AND AND HOW IT'S GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND THE REGULATIONS BECOME PRETTY IMPORTANT AND ALL OF THAT? SO I I JUST WANT TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT -- MY MY CONCERN IS THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BUT ALSO ABOUT PROTECTING -- ANYTIME YOU YOU CREATE A NEW AREA OF THE LAW AND I I KNOW YOU KNOW THIS IT CREATES -- UNCERTAINTY. AND THAT UNCERTAINTY IN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY MEANS THAT -- IF YOU TAKE THE MOST CONSERVATIVE APPROACH YOU DON'T DO THINGS HERE IN THE STATE YOU'LL GO SOMEWHERE ELSE AND I DON'T WANT TO SEE US LOSE. THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO BE CREATIVE AND TO BE INNOVATIVE IN OUR START UPS AND HAVE TO HAVE AN ATTORNEY SAY HERE IS THE RISK IF YOU'RE DOING IT HERE IN THE STATE IN HERE HERE IS WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. ABOUT HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE IMPLEMENTED AND I I REALLY -- APPRECIATED THE I I HAVE READ A LOT ABOUT WHAT THEY'RE DOING IN EUROPE AND I REALLY APPRECIATED THE FOCUS ON COMPLIANCE WITH THE ADVICE WARNINGS AUDITS AND FINANCE I JUST THINK THAT THAT. ANYWAY ANY TIME THAT YOU'RE LOOKING AT A NEW -- A NEW STRUCTURE AND WHAT THE OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES ARE THE MORE THAT YOU CAN TRAIN AND GET PEOPLE TO VOLUNTARILY DO IT THE BETTER OFF WE'RE GOING TO BE SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT IT'S CLEAR I'M TALKING ABOUT START UPS AS WELL AS SMALL BUSINESSES AND THEN THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF A A PIZZA PARLOR BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THAT THAT THAT THIS -- AB REQUIREMENT OR THAT THIS -- LEGISLATION WAS INTENDED TO CAPTURE ALL OF THOSE ARE GOING TO NOT NOT AT ALL NOR NOR THE START OFF I THINK ONCE WE SET SOME BASIC PARAMETERS. COMPANIES WILL FOLLOW THEM AT AGAIN. OF A WIN. MR SOCCER BERG SAYS WE NEED MORE REGULATION AND AND THE GOAL IS NOT TO CONFUSE PEOPLE THE GOAL IS TO SET SOME PARAMETERS THAT EVERYBODY CAN UNDERSTAND -- SO THAT WE CAN PROTECT. PRIVACY RIGHTS AND AT THE SAME TIME I SHARE WITH YOU AND I IMAGINE AT THE IMPORTANCE OF SUPPORTING INNOVATION I THINK WE CAN DO BOTH. THANK YOU I CENTER MINING. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND I THINK. THE OPPONENTS DID NOT RACIST AFFIRMATIVELY BIT IN ARGUMENTS LEADING UP TODAY WE'VE HEARD -- WHEN WE MADE A DEAL BEFORE THE END OF SESSION AND -- HOW CAN WE? CHANGE THE TERMS OF A DEAL THAT WAS AGREED. TO WELL THE DEAL THE RESERVE A TWO POINTS OUT. MAYBE THE BENEFITS AND MAYBE THE DOWNSIDES OF THIS SHORT WINDOW OF TRYING TO KEEP A BALLOT MEASURE OFF THE BALLOT. IN TRYING TO COME UP WITH LEGISLATIVE -- ALTERNATIVE BUT I WOULD POINT OUT THE BENEFIT OF THE LEGISLATIVE ALTERNATIVE IS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE BALLOT TO FIX SOMETHING THAT'S TERRIBLY COMPLEX. AND IF IT'S PASSED ON THE BALLOT THE ONLY WAY YOU FIX IT IS TO GO BACK TO THE BALLOT. SO AS AS MESSY OR AS UNDESIRABLE AS THIS PROCESS MAY SEEM I THINK IT'S BETTER THAN HAVING TO GO BACK TO THE BALLOT. IN ONE OF THE BIG CHANGES FOR ME THAT THAT SUGGESTS THAT WERE NOT SOMEHOW VIOLATING OUR WORD. IS THAT WITHOUT THE INVOLVEMENT OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WE TASK THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S OFFICE WITH ENFORCEMENT. OF THE BILL THAT WE PASSED IN THE ELEVENTH HOUR. THE ATTORNEY GENERAL NOW COMES BACK AND SAYS YOU'VE TASK ME WAS SOMETHING THAT WERE OT RESOURCE FOR THAT WE DON'T THINK WE CAN. PERFORM THESE VARIOUS FUNCTIONS OF ADVICE AND COUNSEL OF RIGHT TO CURE AND THEN POTENTIALLY PROSECUTION -- SO I HAVE A COUPLE OF OTHER COMMENTS IN THIS WILL LEAD TO SOME QUESTIONS ON WHEN WE LOOK AT EUROPE AND THAT WAS. GUIDING FOR MUCH OF WHAT WAS WAS INCLUDED. IN IN THE BILL THAT WE PASSED -- IT WAS. CONSIDERED AN GUIDED IN SEVEN YEARS OF WORK BY -- THE PRIOR ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC -- TO ME THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IS THAT. OUR LAW REQUIRES A CONSUMER TO OPT IN TO BE PROTECTED. I DON'T PARTICULARLY LIKE THAT ASPECT OF THIS BILL. WE HAVE 94% OF CALIFORNIANS SAYING THEY WANT PROTECTION. THING THEY BELIEVE THEY SHOULD HAVE A RIGHT TO ENFORCE THEIR RIGHTS IN THEIR PROTECTIONS AND YET WE FORCE THEM TO TAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE ACT TO BE PROTECTED. TO ME THAT'S A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW IN WHAT WE PASSED IT'S A FUNDAMENTAL FLAW AS WE MOVE FORWARD. BUT I REALIZE THAT'S NOT WHAT IS IN FRONT OF US BUT LET'S REMEMBER. I COME AT THIS THROUGH THE LENS. OF PROTECTING CONSUMERS. AND THAT DOESN'T DIMINISH MY RESPECT MY CONCERN FOR BUSINESSES WHO HAVE TO IMPLEMENT AND GRAPPLE WITH THIS. ITEM I THINK WE NEED SOME BREATHING SPACE AND ONE REASON I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY IS BECAUSE OF THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS WITH THE CONCERN OF PROTECTING SMALL BUSINESSES. WE CAN CREATE SOME CATEGORIES IN HERE IN TERMS OF ENFORCEMENT TERMS OF BOTH OBLIGATIONS AND DUTIES. THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE. BETWEEN GIANT MULTINATIONAL INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS. IN A SMALL START UP THAT MAYBE ONCE BILL TO SWIPE. A CREDIT CARD AT THEIR RETAIL BUSINESS. WE CAN FIGURE THAT OUT WE CAN BUILD IN SOME CATEGORIES NINE INVITE THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY TO BE. PARTNERS IN DOING THAT I THINK WE CAN ACHIEVE THAT [inaudible] ON I ALSO. I THINK THE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION QUESTION -- THE REASON THAT'S IMPORTANT IN FRONT OF US TODAY IS BECAUSE THE NEW INFORMATION IS THE ENFORCEMENT ENTITY INCLUDED IN THE ORIGINAL BILL SAYS WE DON'T THINK WE HAVE THE CAPACITY. TO DO IT SO SOME OTHER IDEAS OF COME UP THE SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED APPROACH COMPARING DISTRICT ATTORNEYS. CITY ATTORNEY'S BUT EVEN WITHIN THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION OF CONSUMER IN IN THAT AREA WE COULD CREATE SOME CATEGORIES AS WELL. IN TERMS OF DAMAGE LIMITS BASED ON THE TYPE OF A BREACH -- OR VIOLATION ON AND HAVE SOME CATEGORIES THERE TO WHAT TYPE OF BREACH WE TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER SOME DISTINCTIONS BETWEEN. PERSONAL DATA BEING COMPROMISED OR EXPORTED. VERSES YOU BEEN HACKED AND THERE'S A DUTY TO TELL YOU THAT YOU'VE BEEN HACKED AND MAYBE THEY WEREN'T APPROPRIATE CYBER PROTECTIONS. BUT LET'S REMEMBER FOLKS. ONE OF THE MOST CRITICAL ISSUES HERE. IS THE WHOLESALE VIOLATION OF OUR PRIVACY RIGHTS AND POTENTIAL MEDICAL INFORMATION BEING SIPHONED CREDIT INFORMATION BEING. OBTAINED AND NEW SOCIAL SECURITY NUMBERS CREDIT CARD NUMBERS THIS IS WHERE WE CAN FACE VERY SERIOUS DAMAGES AND IT'S HARD TO PUT THE GENIE BACK IN THE BOX. IF IF MY CREDIT INFORMATION'S BEEN COMPROMISED FOR MY MEDICAL INFORMATION. WHAT'S THE RIGHT HOW DO YOU CURE THAT. YOU CAN'T PUT THAT GENIE BACK IN THE BOTTLE SO AGAIN I THINK WITH A LITTLE WORK WE COULD HAVE SOME CATEGORIES OF THE TYPES OF BREACH. AND POTENTIAL WOMEN'S ON SOME REMEDIES OR OR NOT. ON OTHER TYPES OF BREACHES -- SO. TO TURN ON THIS LONG COMMENTARY INTO A QUESTION. LET ME ASK THE AUTHOR IF YOU AGREE WITH WHAT I'VE JUST SAID. YEAH. ABSOLUTELY THANK YOU -- CAN ON A MORE SERIOUS NOTE HI. I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH YOU I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY. YOU KNOW THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY HAD A A LOT OF THE FOLKS IN OPPOSITION TO THIS EFFORT TO TRY TO FIX IT. WE'RE NOT SUPPORTERS OF WHAT WENT THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE ON IN WITHIN THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY JUST LOOKING OUT IN THIS ROOM AND SOME OF THE PEOPLE THAT TESTIFIED [inaudible] THERE'S WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN A SMALL BUSINESSES A RETAIL SHOP. IN I THINK WE'VE LEARNED SOME LESSONS FROM THE ABUSES OF THE AMERICANS WITH DISABILITY ACT. AND WE'VE PUT SOME REFORMS AND REMEDIES IN THERE THAT WHILE STILL PERHAPS NOT PERFECT. THEY DO REQUIRE SOME STEPS THEY DO ALLOW A RIGHT TO CURE WHERE APPROPRIATE -- SO LET'S LEARN FROM SOME OF OUR SUCCESSES AND APPLY THAT AS AS THIS MOVES FORWARD IN WORKS AND I THINK FOR SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES. WHO MAY HAVE CONCERNS TODAY ABOUT SUPPORTING THIS? WE GOT SOME TIME THERE'S OTHER COMMITTEES IF IT MAKES IT THROUGH HERE AND OTHER COMMITTEES. ALL OF YOU RESERVE A RIGHT. IF SOMETHING COMES TO THE FLOOR FOR IF WE HAVEN'T GOTTEN THERE YOU WERE SERVER RIGHT NOT TO BE SUPPORTIVE. BUT THIS IS COMING TO US FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND ELECTED OFFICER AND EXECUTIVE US REALLY OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHO SING YOU'VE TASKED ME WAS SOMETHING. THAT WE'RE NOT PREPARED EQUIPPED TO DO. SO WE ARE BEING ASKED BY THE ATTORNEY GENERAL. TO OFFER AVENUES THAT WOULD STILL ENGAGE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IN DEVELOPING. GUIDANCE IN DEVELOPING REGULATIONS AND IN PLAYING AN APPROPRIATE ROLE. OF THE ATTORNEY GENERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SET THE STAGE AND TO MAKE THE RULES OF THE GAME CLEAR. TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS SO AGAIN I APOLOGIZE BUT THIS IS THIS IS IMPORTANT STUFF FOR US TO GET RIGHT AND I% JUST HOPE WILL HAVE A CHANCE. TO WORK O IT AND GET IT RIGHT AND I TOTALLY APPRECIATED I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH YOU AND THAT IS THE REASON THAT I HAVE -- BROUGHT THIS BILL IS WORKING WITH THE ATTORNEY GENERAL FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I THINK YOU'VE MADE MY CLOSING FOR ME BUT I'M SURE THERE ARE OTHER QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH HERE. AND DO IT IN GOOD FAITH BECAUSE THE THE WORLD OF TECHNOLOGY HAS MOVED SO RAPIDLY. AND IT HAS LEFT OUR HUMANITY BEHIND. AND WE NEED TO CATCH UP. IN THAT SPACE. UNLESS I AS SEEN IN THEIR HANDS -- CENTER ALLEN TO WISH TO GO RIGHT NOW. OR WAS IT. FORGIVE ME FOR ME SIR WHAT CASSIE AND YOU IT'S EITHER OKAY SENATE ALLEN -- OKAY. EITHER THIS IS BEEN AT THAT. QUITE AS INTENSE -- DISCUSSION IN THE RUN UP TO THIS THIS MEETING TODAY AND I'VE HAD LONG CONVERSATIONS WITH -- WITH FOLKS ON BOTH SIDES OF CLEAN THE AUTHOR AND ALSO -- THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I REALLY DO WANT TO SEE MYSELF VERTICALLY WITH THE COMMENTS OF CENTER. AGAIN AND I'M CENTER COVER EURO. HERE THERE THERE'S THERE'S A LOT A TO UNPACK WITH THIS -- WITH THIS ISSUE -- CENTER MONEY GOT SEE RIGHT THIS ULTIMATELY IS ABOUT CONSUMERS AND PROTECTING -- GOOD CONSUMERS OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE ONLY THOUGH COURSE LET'S REMEMBER THE REASON WHY WE HAVE THE ONLY SIGNIFICANT PRIVACY ACT IN THIS AREA IN THE NATION. IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT -- THIS MEASURE WAS BROUGHT FORWARD AS A POTENTIAL BALLOT MEASURE AND THE DEAL WAS STRUCK -- THAT -- LED US TO THIS CURRENT ACT BOTH SIDES OF COURSE ARE NOW ENGAGING IN TRYING TO MAKE CHANGES. TO THE ACT THAT'S WHAT MAKES IT ALL A VERY DIFFICULT AN INTERESTING -- BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT -- THAT THAT THAT STRIKING A DEAL AS A PREFERABLE WAY OF MAKING POLICY IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT WHEN SOMETHING GOES THE BALLOT. EVEN IF IT PASSES IT AND HAS TO BE YOU CAN ONLY BE CHANGED WITH THE BALLOT MEASURE AND LET'S REMEMBER. THERE'S A REASON WHY BOTH SIDES DECIDED TO STRIKE THE DEAL PULLING OFTENTIMES SHOWS GREAT NUMBERS ON WONDERFUL PROGRESSIVE MEASURES AND GO DOWN TO DEFEAT. AFTER L. HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS OF MONEY IS SPENT IN A BRUISING CAMPAIGN AND AND SO ALL SORTS OF THINGS CAN END UP -- YOU KNOW NOT WHERE WHERE THE ORIGINAL AUTHORS OF THOUGHT THEY WERE GOING TO BE -- WAS AND GOES TO THE MEASURE NIGHT BECAUSE OF THE BALLOT I THINK THAT'S PART OF WHY THE FOLKS WHO BROUGHT THE BALLOT MEASURE FOR IN THE FIRST PLACE -- WILLING TO STRIKE THE STEEL AND THE THING THAT YOU HEAR FROM EVERYBODY WAS INVOLVED IN THE NEGOTIATIONS. AND THE REASON WHY I THINK EVERYONE KEEPS TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION IS BECAUSE THAT WAS THE ABSOLUTE DEAL BREAKER -- FOR THE FOLKS ON THE BUSINESS SIDE AND THAT THE THE ONLY WAY WE WERE ABLE TO STRIKE A DEAL HERE AND AVOID A RIDICULOUS BATTLE -- COME ELECTION TIME THAT COULD HAVE GONE AND YOU EITHER WAY AND WITH A CERTAINLY INVOLVED A TON OF MONEY SPEND THEN -- A LOT OF A DIFFICULT POLITICS. THE ONLY REASON WHY IS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THIS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WAS STRIPPED. NOW. I UNDERSTAND WHAT ARE THE OTHER SAYING I UNDERSTAND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SAYING THAT YOU KNOW IS NOT EQUIPPED TO HANDLE -- ALL THE THE NEW TASKGIVEN TO HIS OFFICE UNDER THIS MEASURE -- THOUGH I WILL SAY PART OF THE ANSWER TO THAT IS NO ONE WE JUST GIVEN MORE RESOURCES SO WE CAN ACTUALLY HANDLE IT PROPERLY -- YOU KNOW THAT I KNOW THAT CENTER HERTZBERG TALKING ABOUT SOME SORT OF NEW COMPLIANCE OFFICE THAT WOULD TRY TO EFFECTUATE THE RIGHTS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LAW -- I WILL SAY IN ADDITION THAT YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WHAT I'M CENTER CENTER I'M BURKE IS TALKING ABOUT MAYBE PROVIDES US WITH A DECENT PATH HERE. WHERE WE WOULD ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF THE RIGHT AND REMEDY UNITE I AGREE WE WE DON'T WANT TO CREATE A RIGHT THAT DOESN'T HAVE A REMEDY -- AND AND THE PEOPLE WHO ARE REPRESENTED BY THEIR ATTORNEY GENERAL THEIR DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S THEIR CITY ATTORNEYS -- CERTAINLY WOULD EXPECT THERE TO BE A ROBUST -- PUBLIC ENGAGEMENT TO INTUITIVE TO ENSURE THE RIGHTS ASSOCIATED CCPA SO I AM VERY HAPPY TO HEAR YOU BE SO OPEN TO THAT AS AN IDEA -- BECAUSE I THINK IT POTENTIALLY PROVIDES US WITH A WITH AN AVENUE THAT BOTH -- YOU KNOW IT HERE'S TO YOU THAT THAT HONORS THE DEAL. AND THAT AT THE SAME TIME -- WILL WILL REALLY EFFECTUAL WAY THE RMEDY THAT THAT IS -- TO THE RIGHT WHY IS IT THAT I CARE SO MUCH ABOUT THE DEAL THE REASON IS -- THAT IN THE END OF THE DAY THIS LEGISLATURE. HAS A THERE'S A REAL INTEREST IN MAKING SURE THAT OUR WORD IS HONORED THAT THE PEOPLE WHEN THEY WHEN THEY COME TO NEGOTIATE HERE. pUNDER THAT THERE'S A SENSE THAT A DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK AND APPROVED BY OUR LEGISLATURE WILL ACTUALLY HAVE SOME MEANING -- IN THE YEARS FOLLOWING THE DEAL BEING STRUCK AND THEY DID THAT I THINK THAT BETTER PUBLIC POLICY WILL COME OUT OF THAT PROCESS AS A RESULT -- I I DO THINK THAT THE THE THE BALLOT ENDS UP BEING AND IT'S AN IMPORTANT. YOU KNOW REMEDY IT'S IMPORTANT LEVER BUT BUT IT'S A TOTAL CRAP SHOOT AND IT ENDS UP -- OFTENTIMES REWARDING THE FOLKS WHO ARE WILLING TO SPEND THE MOST AMOUNT OF MONEY AND MAKE THE MOST -- FRIGHTENING OF CLAIMS TO THE VOTERS AND VOTERS UNFORTUNATELY HAVE ENDED UP BEING SWAYED EVIDENCE OF THAT. SO I I ALSO UNDERSTAND THIS IS REALLY EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND I AND YOU KNOW I REALLY DO RESPECT THE CHAIR AND I RESPECT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL -- FOR THEIR WORK IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DO EFFECTUATE THE THE THE THE THE THE RIGHTS THAT ARE ENSHRINED IN THE C. C. PA I I AGREE DOESN'T GO FAR ENOUGH IN THE DAY AND I AGREE WE OUGHT TO BE A LOT MORE LIKE EUROPE. WHICH REALLY DOES HAVE A A ROBUST REGULATORY MECHANISM -- YOU KNOW WHEN WE TALK ABOU HAVING MORE REGULATION FOR ME THAT INVOLVES REALLY EMPOWERING -- OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS IN OUR OUR YOU THE FOLKS THAT WE ENTRUST WITH WITH ENFORCING THE LAW -- YOU KNOW PEOPLE LIKE CITY ATTORNEY'S DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S ATTORNEY GENERAL TO TO TO ROBUSTLY ARE ENGAGING IN IN IN IN ACTION TO ENSHRINE AND PROTECT. THE RIGHTS THAT WE'VE PASSED SO ARE. YOU KNOW I I I THINK THE THE IF THIS DOES GOT A COMMITTEE DAY IT'S MY SENSE FROM TALKING -- TO BASICALLY EVERY MEMBER OF THIS COMMITTEE THAT IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF I OF OF YOU. WITH ALL RESPECT FOR YOU AND FOR THE ATTORNEY GENERAL AND THE UNDERSTANDING THIS IS VERY EARLY IN THE PROCESS -- AND FOR YOUR COMMENTS THAT YOU MADE AND THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S MADE TO BE VERY OPEN -- TO TO TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HONOR THE DEAL THAT WAS STRUCK -- AND SO THAT'S THAT'S MY THOUGHTS ON THIS I IT'S IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT AND AND AND KIND OF LONG AND WINDING ROAD EVEN TO GET TO THIS VERY FIRST STAGE. OF THE BILL I DO THINK YOU DO HAVE THE RIGHT YOU KNOW YOU DO DESERVE THE OPPORTUNITY. TO TO KEEP WORKING ON THIS -- BUT I I THINK THERE'S A GREAT DEAL I THINK YOU'RE SENSING A GREAT DEAL OF OF TREPIDATION -- ON THIS COMMITTEE WHEN IT COMES TO THE POSSIBILITY OF ON WINDING THE DEAL I THINK THERE'S JUST A LOT OF DOWNSIDES TO THAT. OUT FROM A POLICY MAKING PERSPECTIVE AND ALSO -- IN TERMS OF THE INTEGRITY OF THE LEGISLATURE MOVING FORWARD AND AND AND SO THAT THOSE ARE MY THOUGHTS ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU CENTER ON APPRECIATED. WELL I KNOW THAT -- I'LL BE MOVING ON TO CENTER STERN INTERESTED IN JUST A MOMENT SO MAYBE IT'S AN APPROPRIATE TIME FOR ME TO CONNECT. SAVE YOUR COMMENTS THAT. LIKE OTHERS YOU'VE HEARD -- SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND SOME OF THE ENCOURAGING -- WORDS -- I HAVE A BIT OF A LIBERTARIAN STREAK IN ME YOU KNOW I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN. THAT WE PROMOTE ENTERPRISE -- BUT WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR PRIVACY -- ARE LOOKED AFTER IN A CREDIBLE WAY. AND AS I'VE MENTIONED IN THIS COMMITTEE AND IN OTHER COMMITTEES THERE TENDS TO BE A BALANCE BECAUSE I THINK GOOD POLICY TENDS TO WAY. OF BOTH THE THE DOWNSIDES IN THE BENEFITS APPROPRIATELY. AND I THINK WE'VE HEARD -- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF BALANCING ACTS THAT ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION -- THAT ARE -- THAT HAVE MERIT -- I'M NOT CERTAIN THAT THERE IS THAT THE EQUILIBRIUM HAS BEEN ACHIEVED YET. AND SO I THINK -- WE HEARD IT -- ADROITLY FROM -- CENTER ALLEN AT THAT -- THERE WAS A DEAL THAT WAS PUT FORWARD AND IT'S IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THIS INSTITUTION TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT INDIVIDUALS AND THAT MAKE ARRANGEMENTS -- WITH POLICY MAKERS -- HAVE THE CREDIBILITY TO CONTINUE MAKING -- THOSE TYPES OF NEGOTIATED OUTCOMES BECAUSE IN THE LONG RUN IT WILL MAKE FOR BETTER POLICY -- IN THIS SITUATION I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT WE HAVE ENFORCEMENT. BEFORE INFRASTRUCTURE. AND WE HAVE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO TESTIFIED THAT THIS IS AN ART. COMING ONTO THE SCENE IN TILL. TWENTY TWENTY THAT WAS DESIGNED LAST YEAR FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME ON THESE TWO YEARS -- FOR IT. THE MEAT TO BE PUT ON THE BONES. SO WE DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE IN PLACE YET WE'RE TALKING ABOUT TAKING. SLEDGE HAMMERS NGUYEN MAY BE A SMALLER DEVICE MIGHT BE MORE APPROPRIATE. I THINK THE IDEA THAT A REGULATOR CANNOT BE AN ENFORCER. DOESN'T GEL WITH HOW OUR SYSTEM ACROSS THE STATE IN THE NATION WORK WE HAVE PLENTY OF EXAMPLES WHERE. REGULATORS ARE INDEED ENFORCERS WHETHER BEYOND WALL STREET OR WHETHER IT BE WITH THE F. PPC YEAR. IT'S IT'S EVERYWHERE -- I PERSONALLY THINK THAT. THERE MIGHT BE A WAY FORWARD -- WITH COMPLIANCE THAT DOES NOT CREATE A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION BECAUSE I'M CONCERNED AS CENTER ON BURKE AND OTHERS HAVE DESCRIBED. THIS IS RED MEAT FOR TRIAL LAWYERS. AND THIS IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ON CLOGGING THE AG'S OFFICE WELL WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT CLOGGING THE JUDICIARY. THIS IS GOING. TO ALLOW FOR A RAVENOUS FRENZY -- IF IT'LL IF IT MOVES FORWARD IN THIS TYPE OF FORM BUT GOING BACK TO WHAT YOU STATEDA CENTER JACKSON. YOUR INTENT IS NOT TO GO AFTER THE LITTLE GUY IT IS TO GO AFTER THE BIG GUY BUT ULTIMATELY WHAT YOU WANT TO DO. IS ACHIEVE CMPLIANCE NOT PUNISHMENT. AND SO IF THAT IS THE TRUE SPIRIT OF THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION I THINK THERE'S A WAY FORWARD. OUR TO TO TO ACHIEVING THAT -- ONE OF THE IDEAS IS THAT IF WE HAVE A THIRTY DAY -- REMEDY PERIOD -- ONE OF THE THINGSTHAT I'VE HEARD IN THE HALLWAYS WHICH IS NOT INITIALLY ABOUT IDEA IS. WE WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT. IN A PERFECT WORLD EXCEPT FOR ME THAT THERE'S NO PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. UNTIL THERE'S A MOMENT IN TIME WE'RE COMPLIANCE HAS PROVEN ITSELF TO BE UNACHIEVABLE. NOW THAT'S NOT IN THIS PROPOSAL RIGHT HERE. THE OTHER THING IS I'M TERRIBLY CONCERNED THAT A CONSTITUTIONAL. OFFICER ORY DEPARTMENT WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HE'S PREEMPTIVELY [inaudible] SAYING THAT. THAT DEPARTMENT SHOULD NOT BEAR THE RESPONSIBILITY. OF DOING WHAT THIS LEGISLATURE TASKS IT TO DO. LAST TIME I CHECKED THAT'S NOT A THAT'S NOT A A A IN AN AUCTION NORMALLY GIVE INTO DERRY'S DEPARTMENTS OF GOVERNMENT. OF FOR FOR IN THIS CASE THE AG'S OFFICE AGES DOESN'T SEEM APPROPRIATE THAT A GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENT SAYS THIS IS TOO COMPLEX BURDENSOME POLITICALLY COSTLY. AND I DON'T WANT MY HANDS DIRTY BY IT I THINK THAT IS BAD POLICY IF WE ALLOW THAT TYPE OF PREEMPTION. DIS TO WEIGH IN ON OUR POLICY MAKING IT SHOULD BE BASED ON THE MERITS. AND OFF ALL CONCLUDE WITH WITH WITH THIS THAT. CENTER MONNING BROUGHT UP A COUPLE OF VERY GOOD POINTS. THAT GOING TO THE BALLOT IS MUCH MORE CUMBERSOME THAN GOING TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THERE'S AND THERE'S AN APP OPPORTUNITY TO REMEDY. THAT'S MORE EASY TO RELATE TO THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS THAN THE BALLOT THAT IS VERY TRUE. I ALSO KNOW THAT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS IS THE BEGINNING PIECE OF A PIECE OF LEGISLATION. I'VE HEARD THAT NOW GOING ON THREE MONTHS IN MY LIMITED TENURE HERE IN THE SENATE. BUT IN THIS INSTANCE. I BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD BE BETTER SERVED IF. YOU WOULD CONSIDER BRINGING THIS ITEM BACK IN A REVISED FORM TO THIS VERY BODY. BECAUSE MOVING THIS ON TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE I THINK IS GOING TO SEND A SIGNAL AND FULLY IRATE. INDIVIDUALS THAT -- IT PROBABLY SHOULD BE OUR PARTNERS NOT NECESSARILY OUR ADVERSARIES I DON'T KNOW IF THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU WOULD CONSIDER. I'M NOT COMFORTABLE AT ALL MOVING THIS ITEM FOR TODAY BUT IF THERE WERE SOME SOME CHANGES MADE -- I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S GOT REAL LEGS I THINK IT COULD BE DONE IN A TRULY pA THAT'S UP TO YOU NOT TO MOVE THIS FOR BUT TO BRING THIS ITEM BACK WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE -- OF FORETHOUGHT WELL OBVIOUSLY I APPRECIATE THAT -- THE AS SHE WILL FIND OUT -- AGENCIES WAY IN ALL THE TIME ABOUT WHAT THEY THINK THEY CAN AND CAN'T DO FOR BETTER OR FOR WORSE. OF FREQUENTLY WE LISTEN TO THEM BECAUSE THEY KNOW THEIR LIMITS BETTER THAN WE DO WHETHER THEY DON'T HAVE ENOUGH PERSONNEL WHETHER IT SEEMS TO BE BEYOND THEIR EXPERTISE. AS FAR AS MY GOAL IS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD. AND IT WILL GO TO A NUMBER OF OTHER COMMITTEES IN THE PROCESS -- WHERE THE OPPORTUNITY -- TO TO CONSIDER IT -- TO CHANGE IT -- AS APPROPRIATE I AM COMMITTED TO NEGOTIATING FURTHER AND TO I'M OPEN TO THE SUGGESTIONS THAT WE'VE HEARD TODAY -- I THINK THAT -- I KNOW THAT TO FOR SOME IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE EXPAND THE PUBLIC -- OF ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM -- I DON'T SHARE WITH YOU THAT VIEW THAT WITH THIS WILL JUST SIMPLY BE RED MEAT AND AT THE COURTHOUSE DOORS WILL FLY OPEN. BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ENOUGH CONCERN HERE SO THAT I AM VERY OPEN TO FINDING OTHER ALTERNATIVES IF THAT IN FACT IS. IS A CONCERN THAT IS EXPRESSED BY. A NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES BUT I DO WANT TO FIND THE ALTERNATIVE I DO WANT TO FIND THE WAY YES. YOU ARE CORRECT MY GOAL IS COMPLIANCE. MY GOAL IS PROTECTING THE PRIVACY RIGHTS OF ALL CALIFORNIANS AND SOMETIMES THAT HAPPENS WHEN YOU SIT DOWN WITH THE OF PEOPLE. BUT WE KNOW THAT IN THE IN THE THE WORLD OF FACEBOOK -- FOR EXAMPLE -- THERE HAVE BEEN PROMISES MADE AND PROMISES BROKEN EVERY STEP OF THE WAY INCLUDING SUCH OUTRAGEOUS THINGS AS A PULLING IN FOR IT IN INFORMATION -- THAT YOU OR THAT DOES SOME OF THE WOMEN I WILL USE THAT IN THAT EXAMPLE BECAUSE IT'S SO FOR OFFENSIVE BUT IT IS SO REAL. SO IS THERE ARE WOMEN OUT THERE. WHO ARE IN THEIR CHILDBEARING YEARS? WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE ABLE TO INCREASE THEIR CHANCES OF PREGNANCY AND SO ON A FITBIT THEY WILL TAKE IN THEY WILL PUT IN THEIR MENSTRUAL CYCLE AND THE FITBIT WILL BE ABLE TO ADVISE HIM AS TO WHEN THEY'RE OVULATING? THAT INFORMATION IS NOW MADE AVAILABLE TO FACEBOOK. AND FACEBOOK KNOWS WHEN YOU'RE OVULATING. WHEN YOUR OVULATION STOPS THERE FOR YOU ARE PREGNANT AND IT STARTS FEEDING INFORMATION TO WOMEN WHO ARE PREGNANT WHO MAY NOT EVEN HAVE FACEBOOK ACCOUNTS? FIVE INFORMATION ABOUT DIFFERENT POLITICAL POINTS OF VIEW ON HOW TO RAISE CHILDREN. OF PRODUCTS TO BUY IN THIS IS COMING TO PEOPLE WITHOUT EVEN HAVING THIS THE FAINTEST CLUE. THAT THEIR INFORMATION MOST PERSONAL INFORMATION. HAS BEEN GIVEN TO A COMPANY THAT THEN USES IT TO THEIR FINANCIAL ADVANTAGE AND THAT IS THE KIND OF THING THAT WE'RE SEEING. AND SO THERE IS A BALANCE THERE SOMEWHERE I HOPE AND I ALSO SHARE A SORT OF LIBERTARIAN STREAK WITH YOU. TO US SO I AM COMMITTED I AM COMMITTED -- TO TO BRINGING A TOGETHER I WOULD LOVE TO HAVE THE STAKEHOLDERS COME HERE AND TALK I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW THAT WHAT'S HAPPENING -- AND WANTED TO SAY -- TO SENATOR ALLEN. I HAD MENTIONED EARLIER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE IN THE ROOM THAT THERE ARE ANYWHERE FROM EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BILLS. EIGHTEEN TO THIRTY FIVE BILLS CURRENTLY IN THE LEGISLATURE BY THE INDUSTRY'S TRYING TO CHANGE THIS DEAL. TO SET THIS SACROSANCT DEAL. THEY DON'T LIKE IT AND SO THEY WANT TO CHANGE IT. AND MICHAEL HERE'S SIDE AS I SAID. IT IS NOT TO CHANGE THE SUBSTANCE BUT TO MAKE SURE THAT% WE ACTUALLY CAN ENFORCE THIS ARRANGEMENT -- SO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS I AM COMMITTED TO CONTINUING TO WORK THIS MEASURE. AND CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- AND WOULD LIKE TO ALSO REMIND THE GOOD SENATOR WE HAD TO I THINK OUR FIRST OR SECOND BILL TODAY WHICH FEELS LIKE IT WAS -- STARTED YESTERDAY MORNING -- WAS A BILL THAT COMPLETELY -- MODIFIES A MEASURE THAT WE PASSED IN VOTED ON ANDALL AGREED TO LAST YEAR BY SENATOR WIENER. BROUGHT BACK A BILL. ON THE LPS ISSUE -- BECAUSE HE DIDN'T LIKE THE BILL THAT HAPPENED LAST YEAR. AND WE HEARD HIM TODAY AND WE MADE THOSE ADJUSTMENTS AND WE PASSED OUT THE BILL BECAUSE IT WAS BETTER THAN WHAT WE HAD. AND I THINK THAT IF WE KEEP THAT IN MIND. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN GOOD FAITH TO TRY TO DEAL WITH THIS REALLY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM -- THAT IS TAKEN OVER WE CAN COME TO A RESOLUTION THANK YOU SENATOR JACKSON'S -- WHAT CASKEY? WE HAVEN'T HAD MANY. WE HAVEN'T HAD MANY ISSUES ON THE BALLOT BECAUSE IT'S JUST BEEN VERY RECENTLY THAT WE HAVE THAT. WE PASS THAT LEGISLATION I THINK WAS A BALLOT MEASURE YEAH TO ALLOW. THE GIVE US AN OPPORTUNITY TO TRY TO RESOLVE THESE ISSUES IN ADVANCE -- WORK OWSKI PLEASE. SO I FOR A LOT OF IDEAS WHY I'VE BEEN HERE I'M. UNCOMFORTABLE WHERE I'M SITTING RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I'M A ADVOCATE FOR PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. BUT IS MY COLLEAGUES HAVE POINTED OUT THIS IS A UNIQUE SITUATION WITH THE INITIATIVE. WE HAVE IS AS I LOOK AT OUR CALENDAR WE HAVE TWO MORE MEETINGS IN THIS COMMITTEE. AND THEN THIS BILL GOES APPROPRIATIONS SO IT'S NOT DOUBLE REFER TO DISCLOSE THEIR WHAT MIGHT YOU BE DOING. WITH WE HAVE AN A SUGGESTION FOR TO REDUCE REMOVE THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION AND INSERT. AN ABILITY FOR CITY ATTORNEYS AND COUNTY ATTORNEYS AND DA'S TO SEE YOU TO HELP OUT THIS. STATE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HE TURNED GENERAL SAID WE'LL THINK ABOUT THAT YOU SAID WILL THINK ABOUT THAT. OKAY THAT DOESN'T THAT DOESN'T CHANGE THE BILL WHAT MIGHT. WHAT WOULD BE THE THE THE HARM I GUESS IF IF WE ALLOW TO IS THE VICE CHAIR SUGGESTS TED AT LEAST TELL US WHERE THIS IS GOING TO GO WE DON'T WANT TO STOP THE BILL BUT WE? IT DOESN'T. THEY WILL HAVE TO TAKE ACTION TODAY I'M I'M UNCOMFORTABLE I'M NOT PREPARED TO BE SUPPORTING IT I DON'T KNOW WHERE WE'RE GOING WITH THE GUIDANCE VERSES THE OPINION LETTER I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN TALK ABOUT IT BUT THOSE. THAT SAID. THAT'S ANOTHER THING IN IN THE RIGHT TO CURE WE HEARD SOME COMMENTS ABOUT WE HAVE OTHER EXAMPLES BUCK HERE IN A WE'RE GOING TO THINK ABOUT IT. I'M NOT ACTUALLY AS I SIT HERE SAYING WHAT WITH THAT NEW LANGUAGE LOOK AT THAT YOU'RE WORKING ON SO. MAYBE YOU CAN HELP ME OUT ON THOSE ON THOSE TWO QUESTIONS SENATOR IF -- I HEAD. TO I KNOW THAT THIS BILL HAS ENGENDERED AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT. OF ALL PUSH BACK. OF FROM A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LOBBYING THIS BILL PROBABLY AS WE'RE SITTING HERE. I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE IT FORWARD -- I'M SURE THAT THERE WILL BE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS AND APPROPRIATIONS. I'M SURE THERE WILL BE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS ON THE FLOOR AND THAT THE BILL IN ORDER TO PASS WILL HAVE TO MEET. THE POSITION OF TWENTY ONE MEMBERS OF OUR HOUSE I KNOW THE BILL WOULD THEN GO OVER TO THE OTHER HOUSE IF IT DOES IN FACT PASS. THEY WILL GO THROUGH THE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE THERE AND PROBABLY THE PRIVACY COMMITTEE THERE. AND WE'LL GO THROUGH A NUMBER OF ITERATIONS -- IF I OF THEM. IF I A WAS -- CONFIDENT THAT WE WERE OPERATING WITH ALL PARTIES NEGOTIATING FROM POSITIONS OF GOOD FAITH -- I WOULD FEEL A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY BUT I AM VERY WELL AWARE THAT -- THERE IS AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF EFFORT TO TRY TO KILL THIS BILL. OF RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW AND THE ONLY WAY I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO SIT DOWN AND TO WORK SOMETHING OUT IS IF WE KEEP THE BILL MOVING. AND AND THAT IS WHY I WOULD LIKE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT I HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS -- THAT I WILL -- DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO ACCOMMODATE THESE CONCERNS I HAVE INVITED -- AND WILK INVITE ANYONE IS IN THIS ROOM WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN TO BE PART OF THOSE DISCUSSIONS AS WE GO FORWARD. TO DO THAT. WE HAVE A A HOLIDAY COMING UP WE HAVE A COUPLE MORE HERE IS WE HAVE FORTY BILLS COMING UP IN OUR NEXT HEARING IF NOT MORE. AND OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AS AS WE TRY TO WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THIS CALENDAR WE ARE GOING TO BE DEALING WITH. DOZENS IF NOT HUNDREDS OF BILLS. THIS IS THE TIME I BROUGHT THIS FORWARD. WE'VE HAD MANY CONVERSATIONS. MORE THAN I THINK I'VE HAD AND JUST ABOUT ANY OTHER BILL. AND I THINK IT IS APPROPRIATE TO SEE WHAT WE CAN DO TO MOVE THIS THING FORWARD. TO WORK WITH SENATOR UMBERG TO WORK WITH A SENATOR COMING YEAR OLD BOTH EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS AND I'VE COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM. AS I HAVE -- WITH -- SENATOR ALLEN IS HIGH WILL WITH ANY OF THE MEMBERSHIP BE HAPPY TO CONTINUE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE US SENATOR BORCHERS AS WELL THE GOAL HERE IS TO KEEP THE BILL MOVING AND TO TRY TO COME UP WITH SOMETHING. THAT WILL ULTIMATELY PASS BECAUSE IF I CAN'T GET THE VOTES. THE BILL ISN'T GOING TO PASS SO I CAN'T GET THE VOTES ARE WON'T BRING IT UP ON THE FLOOR. BUT I WOULD LIKE THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP THE BILL MOVING FORWARD A BECAUSE I THINK THAT THAT IS THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GONNA HAVE SERIOUS NEGOTIATIONS RATHER THAN EFFORTS JUST TO KILL THE BILL. I THINK IT'S AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT TO OUR ONE OF OUR ONE OF INTRODUCED THIS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL'S ASKED FOR AN OPPORTUNITY TO WEIGH IN WHICH SHE WAS NOT GIVEN DURING THE NEGOTIATIONS. AND SENATOR YOU WILL FIND THAT THE AGENCIES THAT WE CALL UPON TO DO ENFORCEMENT OR TO FOLLOW UP ON WHAT WE'RE ASKING THEM WE USUALLY BRING TO THE TABLE AND ASKED THEM. IF THEY ARE ABLE TO DO THIS OR HOW WE CAN BETTER IMPLEMENT OUR GOALS WITH THEIR ASSISTANCE THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN HERE. I'M NOT TRYING TO RELIVE THE OLD THE OLD EFFORT. BY WAS AS WE WERE SLAMMED AT THE END THE SESSION THERE WAS A LOT OF PRESSURE TO GET SOMETHING OUT THERE -- BUT BY VIRTUE OF THE WAY THE INDUSTRY IS BEHAVING NOW THEY CLEARLY DIDN'T EXPECT THAT THEY WERE GOING TO COMPLY WITH IT BECAUSE THEY'RE OUT THERE NOW TRYING TO CHANGE THE TERMS. I'M LOOKING AT THIS BILL FRESH'S IT IS. AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN GET TO AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM. THAT WILL PUT SOME SOME SOME TEETH INTO THIS BILL TO MAKE SURE THAT THE CCPA IS ENFORCED IN THIS STATE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND AND I'M GOING TO BE -- HEADING OVER TO US CENTER STERN AND THEN FINAL COMMENTS BY CENTER ON BURKE -- BUT FIRST YOU'VE BEEN PATIENT YOU'VE. YOU'VE RAISE YOUR HAND TWICE PROCEDURALLY -- I IT DOESN'T TO EVOKE A A RIGHT TO SAY ANYTHING BUT I'M ASSUMING I'M ASSUMING THAT YOU'D LIKE TO COMMENT ON HER INTEREST TO WORK WITH. JOHN INDUSTRY FOLKS IS THAT WHAT YOU'RE WHERE YOU'RE GOING ABSOLUTELY CAN YOU COMMENT ON THAT YES INDUSTRY AND BUSINESS VERY MUCH WANT TO COMPLY WITH THE STATUTE AND FIND WORKABLE WAYS TO COMPLY. THESE ISSUES ARE COMPLICATED WE'VE HEARD THE EXAMPLE OF THE FLOW ABBOTT BOTH AT THIS HEARING AND AT THE MARCH FIFTH HEARING. IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND THAT MANY THE PLATFORMS HAVE TERMS THAT PROHIBIT. MOBILE APPS FROM UPLOADING THAT KIND OF MATERIAL TO THEM. HOW TO PLEASE THAT HOW BEST TO ARRANGE THESE THINGS SO THAT THERE IS AGAIN IF WE CAN ALL GET AROUND A TABLE AND DISCUSS THINGS SAID THAT IT'S NOT AN US VERSUS THEM? UNDERSTANDING THAT THOSE ACTIVITIES BY ROW GAPS LIKE FLOW ARE NOT ENDORSED NECESSARILY BY LARGER ENTITIES ON AS THE WALL STREET JOURNAL ARTICLE DISCUSSED. WHAT I WANTED TO JUST SAY IS THAT THERE IS A WILLINGNESS ON THE PART OF BUSINESS TO WORK WITH THE? CHAIRMAN I JACKSON AND DO ALL THAT WE CAN TO WORK WITH YOU HERE TO ADDRESS THIS THESE COMPLICATED ISSUES TOGETHER LIKE IN THE EO. AND JUST TO CLARIFY WE HAVE ANOTHER MEETING IN TWO WEEKS AND I'M ACTUALLY LOOKING AT I IN FACT ALL THE T. WE HAVE ANOTHER -- JUDICIARY -- MEETING IN TWO WEEKS IS THAT CORRECT THAT IS CORRECT WE HAVE FORTY TO FIFTY BILLS WELL OUT I WE SHOULD AND I REALLY THAT SURE THAT ETERNITY. AS THE TALKING ABOUT SIR. IT'S IT'S MY PREROGATIVE I REALLY DO WANT TO MOVE THIS BILL I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS -- A GOD LOVE YOU FOR VOTE BUT I I WANT TO MOVE THIS BILL AND I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON IT AND I ACCEPT THIS AS AN INVITATION. BY THE OPPOSITION'S DOWN AND HELP US THANK THANK YOU. I WANT TO MAKE CERTAIN THAT -- WE DON'T ALLOW BAD POLICY TO HAPPEN WHEN POLICY MAKERS PANIC AS WELL. SO CENTER STERN DID YOU HAVE SOME COMMENTS -- THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR. MADAM CHAIR -- WE'VE TALKED A BUNCH ABOUT THIS I I SHARE YOUR CONCERN WITH THE BAD FAITH SHOWN BY SOME OF THE LARGEST COMPANIES IN THIS COUNTRY THAT WE'VE COME TO TRUST AND I WAS THERE. BEFORE THERE WAS FACEBOOK AND DURING WHEN IT BECAME SOMETHING AND IT BECAME SOMETHING THAT WE DIDN'T ANTICIPATED TO BE I THINK -- AND THE THOSE BREACHES OF GOOD FAITH AT THE NATIONAL LEVEL OF SHAKEN S. [inaudible] SO. YOU KNOW I APPRECIATE THE THE ORIENTATION HERE TO STRENGTHEN AND I THINK. I THINK THE THE THE CONCERNS YOU FOR TODAY ARE NOT EFFORTS TO KILL THE BILL OR SOME. ALLEGIANCE TO WHATEVER INDUSTRY EVEN MEANS I HER NEWSPAPERS TESTIFYING HERE TODAY HER NON PROFITS TESTIFYING HERE TODAY. I THINK IT'S ABOUT MECHANICS SO I I GUESS I WANTED TO JUST STRUCTURE MY QUESTIONS TO INTO TWO PARTS ONE IS THIS THE SUBSTANCE SOMEONE'S THE PROCESS SO. ON THE SUBSTANCE. I I DIFFER A LITTLE BIT WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUES CENTER -- BERGEN ALLEN IN TERMS OF THEIR PREMISE SEEMS TO BE LET'S LET'S TO YOU KNOW PUBLIC OFFICIALS. NOT PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION. AS A BETTER ENFORCEMENT TOOL RIGHT TO THE THAT INCLUDES CITY ATTORNEY'S D. A.'S -- WELL YES SO BUT SO NOT JUST THE AG BUT THEN OTHER LOCAL PUBLIC FAKE. PUBLIC LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS TO ENFORCE. I'M I'M. IT'S AN INTERESTING CONCEPT I'M STILL WRESTLING WITH WHETHER THAT'S THE BEST MECHANISM TO PROTECT CONSUMERS. VERSES THIS P. ARE A METHOD YOU'VE GOT VERSES. AYE AYE GDP OUR STYLE METHOD WORD BASE EVE GUIDE I MEAN I THINK IN IRELAND ALONE. THERE'S THERE'S A THOUSAND PEOPLE IN AN OFFICE I'M WORKING ON GPR IMPLEMENTATION JUST FOR THE U. K.. SO WANTED TO GET A LITTLE BIT OF PERSPECTIVE EITHER FROM YOU OR FROM THE AG'S OFFICE. SAY THIS BILL DIDN'T BECOME LAW AND THIS ONE HERE TODAY I JUST LOOKED UP YOUR B. C. P. FOR THE YEAR I THINK IT'S TWENTY THREE POSITIONS THEY'VE BEEN ASKED. FOR FORGET THE NUMBER HOW. FOUR MILLION THREE MILLION SOMETHING LIKE THAT SOME AS SPECIAL FUNDS SOME OF THE GENERAL FUND -- THAT WAS BASED ON A SORT OF ANTICIPATION OF ESTIMATED THREE CASES A YEAR TO PROSECUTE. SO SAY THIS MORNING LAW LIKE HOW HOW HOW WOULD C. C. P. A.. BE ENFORCED CURRENT [inaudible] IN. AND AND WHAT WHAT DO WHAT DOES THE ATTORNEY GENERAL I GUESS NEED TO GET THAT DONE. UNDER THE CURRENT FRAMEWORK I I RECOGNIZE THAT YOUR YOUR THESIS HERE IS THAT THAT'S THAT IT'S AN INSUFFICIENT METHOD AND YOU DON'T HAVE ENOUGH. HANDS OF THE TAYLOR TO TO MAKE IT HAPPEN BUT I JUST I JUST WANT TO GET A SENSE FROM YOU ALL LIKE YOUR MADE. YOUR MADE IMPLEMENTATION THAT RIGHT YOU BUT WORKSHOPS YOU'VE DONE INITIAL NOTICES SO. BEYOND THAT TWENTY THREE I KNOW WE'RE NOT BUDGET COMMITTEE BUT WHAT DOES A WHAT DOES A REGULATORY APPROACH LOOK LIKE. SO. WE JUST CLARIFY WITH THE TWENTY THREE MEMBERS OF THE TWENTY THREE POSITIONS THAT WOULD. NO YOU'RE RIGHT OKAY THAT WAS RIGHT. ON THE TWENTY THREE POSITIONS INCLUDES BOTH -- AN INVESTIGATION FOR THE NATION'S TEAMS OF STAFFING FOR ENFORCEMENT BY DOING INVESTIGATIONS AS AS WELL AS AT LITIGATING VIOLATIONS OF THE CZ PA. AS WELL AS AN ADDITIONAL - A NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT WOULD BE DOING ON GOING REGULATIONS BECAUSE THE CCPA AUTHORIZED TRAIN GENERAL TO DO REGULATIONS ON AN ONGOING BASIS NOT JUST IN ORDER -- TO PROMULGATE REGULATIONS. UNDER POINT. ONE EIGHT FIVE FIVE DIED JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY SO THERE WAS A WITH A LITTLE BIT OF LOOKING AT YOU KNOW A MULTITUDE OF RESPONSIBILITIES AT THAT THE CPA -- ENTERS IN THE AG IN TERMS OF MAKING SURE THAT WE CAN ADEQUATELY ENFORCE. IF I UNDERSTAND YOUR YOUR QUESTION -- I THINK THE THE ISSUE HERE IS THAT THERE'S FORTY MILLION CALIFORNIANS. AND THE SCOPE OF BUSINESSES THAT THE CZ P. APPLIES TO IS SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE. AND SO IN ORDER -- TO TO TO HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE NEED TO AVAILABLE TO ENSURE THAT BUSINESSES ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW ON BEHALF OF ALL THOSE FORTY MILLION PEOPLE. IT WOULD BE CAN A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE POWER RIGHT TO MAKING SURE THAT. THAT. THAT THERE'S RESPONSES TO PUBLIC COMPLAINTS OR WHISTLE BLOWERS OR YOU KNOW INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATIONS THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE AND FIND OUT THAT COMPANIES ARE SELLING INFORMATION WHEN WHEN. CONSUMERS HAVE OPTED OUT FOR EXAMPLE AND SO I THINK THAT THAT THE THE THE REASON THAT THE PEORIA SO IMPORTANT HERE IS BECAUSE IT PROVIDES CRITICAL ADJUNCT. TO DO WORK AT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL SO YOU KNOW THERE IT WOULD WORK IN PARALLEL IN TERMS OF NSURING THAT THE LAW IS ENFORCED AND IT ALSO OAK PROVIDE FOR THAT THIS GROUNDBREAKING LAW THAT CONSUMERS NOW HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL. HOW THEIR INFORMATION IS USED AND AND WHETHER OR NOT A COMPANY -- CAN RETAIN INFORMATION BY FACTORING THE RIGHT TO DELETE AND WHATNOT. YOU KNOW TO PROVIDE THOSE RIGHTS AND THEN STATE BUT YOU CAN FORCE THEM IF IF A COMPANY DOESN'T COMPLY YOU KNOW THAT IS JUST ALSO ABOUT FUNDAMENTAL FAIRNESS AS WELL. SO JUST TO GIVE A LITTLE BIT OF OF MORE -- COLOR TO WHAT THE TWENTY THREE POSITIONS ARE THAT WE'RE SEEKING -- TO THAT THAT'S IF I UNDERSTAND YOU CORRECTLY. AND AND ALSO I JUST I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT AND I MAY BE WRONG I AM NOT AN EXPERT ON GPR I'M SURE THAT. THERE ARE MANY OTHER PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM THAT PROBABLY COULD SPEAK TO IT BUT I I THINK THAT IN IRELAND IF I'M CORRECT THAT THE DPA IS A HUNDRED AND TEN PEOPLE FOR FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION POPULATION SO THAT THAT. BACK PRESHOW INTERNET IN ITSELF WAY UNDERSTAFFED WE AND OUR STAFF HERE. AND SO IS THERE ACTUALLY CAN YOU FLESH THAT CAN ONE OF YOU FIRST THAT YOU HAVE YOU HAD EXPERIENCE WITH G. D. P. R. IMPLEMENTATION YES. SO IS IS IS THE TRAINING GENERAL'S OFFICE RIGHT IN TERMS OF JUST. LEVEL OF WOMAN AND MAN POWER BEING THROWN IT IMPLEMENTATION RIGHT FEET THERE IS AN INVESTMENT IN AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER THE DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITY PROVIDES THREE THIRTY OFFICES TO INCREASE STAFF. TO DEAL WITH -- GPR AND AND AND AGAIN THAT'S LED TO THE COMPLAINTS CULTURE THAT THEY ARE INCULCATED IN EUROPE WHERE COMPANIES CAN GET THE NOTICE THE ADVICE. THE GUIDANCE THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THE LAW BECAUSE THEY ULTIMATELY THE GOAL IS TO COMPLY AND TO ARRIVE AT A POINT WHERE THERE WE REACH A COMPLIANCE CULTURE AS IT RELATES TO THESE TOPICS. GUIDANCE IS NEEDED PARTICULARLY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT ENTIRE INFRASTRUCTURE NEW BUSINESS SYSTEMS THAT NEED TO BE PUT IN PLACE ON AN ENTERPRISE WIDE LEVEL GLOBAL LEVEL. SO THESE ARE AS IMPORTANT STEPS TO TAKE TIME AND COMPANIES ARE GOING THROUGH IT VERY THOUGHTFULLY I AS I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING I TRAINED OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED BUSINESS AGAIN EXECUTIVES. AT CONFERENCES ACROSS THE COUNTRY THEY ARE FLOCKING TO UNDERSTAND THIS LAW AND TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO IMPLEMENT IT AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW WE HAVE TEAMS HAVE SEVENTY PEOPLE IN OUR PRIVACY DATA SECURITY GROUP AT AT PERKINS COOLEY. WE HAVE TEAMS OF US TRYING TO UNDERSTAND ALL OF THE INTRICACIES TO THE SO THAT WE CAN PROPERLY ADVISE CLIENTS NOT AS A WAY TO GET AROUND THE LAB IS A WE TO COMPLY IN THE SPIRIT OF CULTURAL COMPLIANCE. THEY WERE DISCUSSING AND AND WITH ALL DUE RESPECT I'M ACTUALLY I'M NOT EVEN WORRIED ABOUT THOSE FOLKS I'M WORRIED ABOUT THE FOLKS WHO CAN'T AFFORD YOU. EXACTLY AS HE MAKES IT WORSE FOR THEM SO YOU KNOW TO CREATE THE GUIDANCE THAT GUIDES CAN BE USED FOR SMALL BUSINESSES INDIVIDUALS TO LEARN UNDERSTOOD SO. JACKSON I JUST HEARD MADAM CHAIR I'M SORRY -- I KNOW USE YOU EXPRESSED OPENNESS ON THIS THIS OTHER STRATEGY CITY ATTORNEY. D. A THAT SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED CONCEPT THIS REGULATORY APPROACH THOUGH AND MAYBE IT'S NOT IN D. O. J. PER SE I MEAN I I'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT. IS THEIR OPENNESS. TO THINKING ABOUT THAT ARE YOU ARE YOU WON'T. IS YOUR SORT OF PREMISE THAT -- THERE NEEDS TO BE A SORT OF A LITIGATION BASE FRAMEWORK TO REALLY MAKE INFO FOR CEMENT WORK HERE MY MY PREMISE AND MY GOAL IS TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE. AND SO IF THERE'S A WAY WE CAN DO THAT FOR EXAMPLE OFFICE OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT I CAN ASSURE YOU DOESN'T HAVE. DOESN'T HAVE THE THE ABILITY TO DO THIS BUT AND IN TO CREATE A NEW -- THE A NEW MECHANISM MAY BE DOABLE OR NOT. BUT WE DO HAVE CERTAIN THINGS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN TOOLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO US NOW. THAT I WANT TO EXPLORE BOB BECAUSE ENFORCEMENT IS CRITICALLY IMPORTANT I SUSPECT MANY COMPANIES DO WANT TO COMPLY -- BUT LIKE ANYTHING IF YOU DON'T HAVE. THE INCENTIVE. OR AND AND YOU DON'T HAVE THE CONSEQUENCES MOST BUSINESSES OPERATE ON A RISK ANALYSIS. IS THERE A RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MY NOT COMPLYING -- IN IF THE ANSWER IS NO THEN WE'RE NOT THIS LIKELY TO GET COMPLIANCE AS WE ARE IF THERE IS A LEGITIMATE RISK IN THAT RISK WOULD BE. LITIGATION THAT RISK COULD BE REGULATION WHICH I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET ANYWAY THE AGE SHE IS WORKING ON REGULATION. SO THAT'S YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THE WILD WEST -- BUT I'M CERTAINLY OPEN TO AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO TALK WITH THE OPPOSITION ABOUT A METHOD THEY FEEL WOULD GET US TO THE GOAL WHICH IS TO GET COMPLIANCE. AND I'M NOT JUST FOR THE BIG GUYS RIGHT I MEAN NO NOT FOR THE NO NO NO NO NO. SO SO I CAN TELL YOU WE'VE DONE THIS I I WILL USE AS A SIMPLE ANALOGY WHEN I DID MY LEGISLATION ON EQUAL PAY. THERE WAS THIS BIG CONCERN WHAT IS SHIP MEAN WE'VE GOT ALL THESE DIFFERENT RULES AND WE'VE GOT DIFFERENT CRITERIA. WE BROUGHT TOGETHER ALL THE STAKE HOLDERS AND WE NOW HAVE A A WORKING OF VIABLE. A PROCEDURE BY WHICH COMPANIES BIG AND SMALL. CAN GET THATKIND OF DIRECTION THROUGH EGGS EXISTING. OF AN EXISTING FRAMEWORK THAT WAS CREATED WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS COMINGTOGETHER -- WITH A A NUMBER OF THE DIFFERENT -- BUSINESS SHOULD COMMUNITY THE CHAMBER GOT INVOLVED IN IT AND OTHERS. AND I LIKE I LIKE THAT IDEA TO WORKING AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO CONSIDER THAT BUT THERE IS ALSO AN ILL -- AND IMPLEMENTATION MECHANISM THAT EXISTS IN PERHAPS THAT'S WHERE WE LOOK AT CITY ATTORNEYS AND DH THERE HAS TO BE. THERE HAS TO BE A VIABLE WAY TO ENFORCE. AND AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE LOOKING AT HERE I ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT YOU KNOW THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAT THE PRIVACY UNIT SITS IN THE CONSUMER THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION. THAT WE ARE WERE TASKED WITH ENFORCING STATE AND FEDERAL. CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AS IT RELATES TO CALIFORNIANS PRIVACY AND ALTHOUGH. I SUPERVISE A A SMALL TEAM OF MODEST TEAM WITHIN THE UNIT -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE BROUGHT ACTIONS AGAINST COMPANIES FOR VIOLATING THOSE RATES -- SINCE THE INCEPTION OF THE OF OF THE UNIT WAS CREATED AND SO ENFORCEMENT IS A A VERY IMPORTANT WAY OF ENSURING THAT BUSINESSES DO COMPLY BECAUSE THEY KNOW -- THAT DAY THEY ARE THEY IT PROVIDES FOR BRIGHT LINE RULES I AGREE THAT'S WHAT WE WANTED YOU TO DO IT. THAT'S WHY WE ARE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SO I MEAN YOU SAID YOU ANTICIPATED RALLY THESE THREE CASES A YEAR. IS. IS THAT BASED ON WHAT DID YOU BASE THAT ON DO YOU THINK THERE WILL BE MORE THAN THREE CASES A YEAR THAT ARE LEFT. AND AND THAT THAT WAS SORT OF WHAT YOU COULD HAVE. AGAIN I THINK WHAT WE DID WITH YOU WE LOOKED AT YOU KNOW THE WORK OF THE CONSUMER LAW SECTION OVERALL IN TERMS OF HOW IT'S YOU KNOW. LOOKING AT WHAT LAWS HAVE BEEN VIOLATED AND AND YOU KNOW TRY TO ESTIMATE BASED ON HOURS -- LOOKING BACKWARDS IN TERMS OF WHAT THE HOURS THAT WE SPENT ON SIMILAR CASES AND FORCING STATUTES THAT THIS TYPE OF SCOPE AND BREATH. I'M LAST POINT LAST QUESTION THE SUBSTANCE FOR YOU ALL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR INDULGENCE -- IS IS ABOUT THE THE ACTUAL SCOPE OF THE OF THE VIOLATIONS CONTEMPLATED HERE BECAUSE I KNOW THAT. WHAT WE ALL AGREED TO IN THE C. C. P. A. IS BREACH BASED YOU KNOW SOARED INJURY TRIGGERED -- IN ENFORCEMENT. AND AND BY STRIKING THAT THAT PROVISION IN. WHATEVER IT IS -- SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT ONE FIFTY SEE -- AN OPENING IT UP WHAT WHAT WHAT NEW WHAT NEW KINDS OF BAD ACTIONS ET DO YOU THINK WILL CAPTURE HERE THE BEYOND. BREACH AT THERE WERE SOME ANECDOTES MENTION ABOUT. THAT WELL THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE FOR EXAMPLE PEOPLE -- THERE'S THEIR OPT OUT PROVISIONS ARE OFTEN PROVISIONS WHAT IF THEY'RE NOT IF THE COMPANIES ARE IGNORING THOSE -- THOSE REQUIREMENTS FOR SOMEONE OP SOUTH NAY STILL CONTINUE TO USER INFORMATION OR THE YOU KNOW THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT. ASPECTS TO THIS AND WHAT THE THE GOAL IS TO PUT THE BREACHES ARE ONE THING AND THEY'RE COVERED AND AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY. THAT IT THOSE ARE WHAT THEY ARE THE THE QUESTION IS ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT ARE NON BRIDGE RELATED HOW DO WE ENFORCE THOSE THINGS -- SO THAT IS SO THAT CONSUMERS ARE ASSURED WHEN THEY DO IN FACT OPT OUT THAT THEY ARE IN FACT OPTED OUT. AND AND THAT THOSE AREN'T NECESSARILY EASY THINGS. TO TO ASSURE HAND AGAIN THE GOAL IS TO RESPECT THE WHEN CONSUMERS ACTUALLY DO ASSERT THEIR RIGHTS THEY HAVE TO BE RESPECTED. HE JIM DID YOU HAVE A COMMENT YET. ANOTHER EXIT DO YOU HAVE A DO YOU HAVE A COMMENT YEAH I JUST HAD ONE EXAMPLE AND OPENING UP THE STEPS PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION TIãU. KUN AND SERVE TINY ERRORS AS A GOTCHA THAT WILL CREATE MUNIS CLASS ACTIONS FOR COMPANIES ONE EXAMPLE. LIKE WHAT'S A GOTCHA ONE EXAMPLE IS HOW. TO CATEGORIZE DIFFERENT VENDORS WEATHER SO THE NOTICE PROVISIONS IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE HUNDRED OR SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT. ONE TEN TALK ABOUT PROVIDING NOTICE ON IT AND WHEN TEN TALKS ABOUT PROVIDING NOTICE OF THIRD PARTIES THAT DATA IS SHARED WITH WILL VENDORS CAN BE THAT IF THEY'RE PROVIDING SERVICES MAY ALSO BE CONSIDERED. A SERVICE PROVIDER THE DEFINITION OF SERVICE PROVIDER OVERLAPS WITH THE DEFINITION OF A PERSON IN SEVENTEEN NINETY EIGHT POINT ONE FORTY W. TO THAT PROVIDE SERVICES SO. IF THE IF BACK AT THE RANCH THE COMPANY DOES NOT CATEGORIZE THAT VENDOR IN THE SAME WAY THAT A CLASS ACTION ATTORNEY. BOB DOES THEY MIGHT VERY WELL FIND THEMSELVES IN A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A RUINOUS CLASS ACTION AT THE RATES OF TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED OR SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS PER VIOLATION. AND IF YOU WERE TO TAKE THAT JUST TAKE THE MAGNITUDE REALLY IS ENORMOUS IN TERMS OF THE EXPOSURES THAT COMPANIES COULD FACE FOR THAT KIND OF THE THING. THAT SECURING AND THEY'LL BE TOLD FOOD THROUGH THE REGULATORY PROCESS AND ALL HOW THEY VIOLATED THAT THAT'S THE WHOLE POINT IS TO CLICK TRY TO CLEAR THIS UP AND AND I THINK THAT THAT JUST LENDS FURTHER GRAVITY THIS BROADER EFFORT WE'RE GOING TO GO THROUGH THIS LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR'S. IF WE'RE GOING TO GO BEYOND JUST PREACH AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD SOME NEW ENFORCEMENT THIRTY WE BETTER BE DARN SURE THAT EVERYONE IS VERY CLEAR ABOUT WHO'S IN WHO'S OUT. WHAT THE THRESHOLD ON A SMALL BUSINESS WHO ISN'T EXPOSED TO X. Y. AND Z. -- EXACTLY WHAT IS A SERVICE PROVIDER OR SALE OF INFORMATION I THINK YOU MENTIONED UNAUTHORIZED SALE RIGHT I MEAN WHAT IS THAT P. I. N. SO. I I'M I'M ACTUALLY. I I CAN SEE A REALLY POSITIVE CONVERSATION ACTUALLY EMERGING OUT OF THIS WHERE YOU'VE GOT THIS PIECE THERE'S OTHER CLEAN UP EFFORTS GOING ON AND HOPEFULLY WE GET TOWARDS THAT SO. THAT'S ALSO ON THE SUBSTANCE JUST ON THE PROCESS -- IN YOUR MIND IS THIS. IS THIS WITHIN ARE YOU TRYING TO MOVE IS WITHIN THE SPIRIT OF THE DEAL WE MOVED LAST YEAR OR IS YOUR PREMISE THAT. THE DEAL WE STRUCK LAST YEAR'S INSUFFICIENT AND THIS HAS WE HAVE TO DO SOME OF IT GOES BEYOND RIGHT NOW WE TRYING TO ARGUE WITHIN THE LANES OF THE C. C. P. A.'S INTENT ARE YOU SAYING. YOU KNOW WHAT. THAT WAS LAST YEAR IT'S NOT ENOUGH WE GOT TO DO SOMETHING NEW WELL AS I THINK AS I SAID EARLIER THE THE THE SUBSTANCE OF THIS ARRANGEMENT. IS VERY DIFFERENT TO WHAT I WOULD HAVE WANTED AND IS SENATOR MONNING SO ELOQUENTLY PUT IT I WOULD HAVE WANTED EXACTLY THE REVERSE OF WHAT WE'VE GOT. BUT THAT WAS THE VOTE WE TOOK LAST YEAR. I AM NOT TRYING TO TOUCH THE THE THE WORKINGS OF THE CCPA I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A VALID ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM I'M LEAVING. AGAIN I AM. I'M NOT A BIG FAN OF THIS DEAL BUT I AM NOT TRYING TO CHANGE THE STEEL THIS BILL THAT I BROUGHT TODAY IS JUST SOMETHING TO ASSURE THAT WE CAN PROPERLY ENFORCED THE DEAL THAT WAS MADE. AND THAT'S THAT IS WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO. YOU DON'T THINK THAT HAVING LIABILITY FOR THINGS BEYOND PREACH CHANGES THE DEAL NO. I THINK WHAT IT DOES IS IT ENFORCES IT THERE ARE THERE ARE TERMS THE DEAL THIS THIS BILL CALLS FOR SPECIFIC KINDS OF BEHAVIOR. IT'S AS WHAT YOU CAN AND CAN'T DO. WHAT GOOD IS THAT IF YOU CAN'T ENFORCE IT? AND THAT IS A TRULY HAVING A RIGHT WITHOUT A REMEDY AND THAT'S THAT'S WERE THAT IS WHAT THE STE. THAT IS THE WHOLE INTENT AND IF YOU WILL SPIRIT OF THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF LEGISLATION AND I I HAVE MAYBE MORE FAITH IN THE THE ATTORNEY GENERAL THAN -- THAN THEY DO IT PRESENT IN THEIR ABILITY TO GO PROVIDE THAT REMEDY BUT I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR AND IF WE'RE GOING TO VOTE TODAY. WHAT IT IS WERE VOTING ON THEIRS IT'S A IT'S IT'S BEEN ACTUALLY I THINK A REALLY CONSTRUCTIVE CONVERSATION A LOT OF IMPORTANT IDEAS FLESHED OUT APPRECIATE YOUR OPENNESS? TO BUT THIS IS A BIG THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND YEAH I THANK. YOU FOR GOING WITH THE P. ALREADY APPROACH THAT'S COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED WHICH IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM -- SHOULD A G. P. R. STYLE DPA APPROACH. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I'M VOTING ON HERE. WELL. I THINK WHAT YOU'RE VOTING ON IS THE BILL THAT'S BEFORE YOU WITH A COMMITMENT THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TRYING TO WORK TO CREATE. AN ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM THAT IS GOING. TO MEET THE THE EXPECTATIONS ON THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL. AND THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO GAIN THE SUPPORT OF AT LEAST TWENTY ONE PEOPLE ON THE SENATE SIDE. AND AT LEAST FORTY ONE PEOPLE AS IT GOES THROUGH WHATEVER ITERATIONS IT WILL GO THROUGH IN THE ASSEMBLY SIDE WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING WE NOW HAVE SOMETHING THAT THE EIGHT WITH THAT WE'VE GIVEN TO THE AG THE AG SAYS IT ISN'T WORKABLE. FOR FOR HIM TO DO ALL THESE VARIOUS THINGS BUT THE AGE SHE IS ALSO WILLING TO LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO THAT'S THAT'S A COMMITMENT I MAKE. AND I THINK IT'S CRITICALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE END UP. MEETING THE EXPECTATIONS OF 94% OF CALIFORNIANS WHO WANT THEIR PRIVACY RIGHTS PROTECTED. AND AND WITH THAT I WOULD TO SO I THINK THE START CENTER STERN. YEAH THAT WAS JUST THE ONE LAST POINT IS I'M WITH THAT 94% I THINK THE DISCUSSION IS HOW BEST TO DO IT. AND AND THE THING THAT WOULD MAKE ME A LOT MORE COMFORTABLE TAKING A VOTE IS TO HEAR FROM THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHAT WHICH APPROACH IT IS. HE WANTS TO PURSUE IF IT SEEMS LIKE THIS IS THE POSITION OF HIM AND HIS OFFICE WAS THE AUTHOR THAT WE'RE GOING. TO APPROACH ENFORCEMENT HERE. AND WHAT BY PHONE TODAY WERE SAYING THAT'S THE DEAL. AND THEN WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS DOWN THE LINE I JUST DON'T I DON'T UNDERSTAND THE RUSH LIKE WHITE WHITE THAT ISN'T THAT ISN'T A DEAL THAT ISN'T THE DEAL THE DEAL IS AT THE AGE SHE IS COMMITTED TO LOOKING INTO THE POSSIBILITY OF A SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED OPTION. IT'S WILL LOOK AT OTHER OPTIONS I WILL BE HAPPY TO SIT DOWN WITH THE OPPOSITION. AND TRY TO WORK SOMETHING OUT IF THEY ARE WILLING TO DO THAT BUT TO SIMPLY SAY THIS IS TOO COMPLICATED IT'S JUST NOT AN ANSWER. THIS MAN WHAT WHY NOT TAKE A BREATH FIRST SECOND WORK ON ALL THIS LOOK AT THE DPA APPROACH IF THAT'S NOT A GOOD IDEA FINE TOSS IT IS SEVENTEEN TWO HUNDRED AS PROBLEMS WITH IT OR DOESN'T WORK IN A SMAL BUSINESS TOSS IT BUT LIKE LET'S. I I'M ASKING WHAT WE'VE WHAT WE'VE DONE TODAY IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT COMMITTEES WITH DIFFERENT AUTHORS INCLUDING THE AUTHOR OF THIS PARTICULAR BILL. ASKING FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO KEEP WORKING WITH THE WITH THE VARIOUS INTEREST GROUPS SO THAT WE CAN KEEP THE BILL MOVING FOR WE CAN KEEP THE CONCEPT MOVING FORWARD. SO THAT WE CAN END UP WITH SOMETHING THAT IS GOING TO MEET. THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS LEGISLATURE BECAUSE I NEED TWENTY ONE VOTES TO GET A BILL OFF THE FLOOR. I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO KEEP WORKING TO TRY TO FIND THAT SWEET SPOT AND THAT IS THE COMMITMENT I MAKE TO TODAY. THANK YOU A SENATOR STERN I THINK GROUND WE HAVE OUR FINAL TO LISTEN MALES WANT TO CHIME IN FINAL -- TO JUST CLOSING CLOSING COMMENTS I PROMISE. SO A COUPLE THINGS ONE ONE I THINK WE ALL AGREE THAT SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE WE CAN'T JUST. AVOID A RESPONSE BILLION DO NOTHING TO IT'S VERY COMPLICATED. CRITICAL YOUR EXAMPLE OF THE FITBIT OF THE WOMAN WEARING A FITBIT IS A CLEAR ILLUSTRATION OF HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. THREE THAT YOU'RE FLEXIBLE IN THE AG'S FLEXIBLE -- AND I MADE A COMMITMENT TO YOU SENATE JACKSON MADAM CHAIR I SAID THAT THIS BILL IS GOING TO MOVE FORWARD WITH WITH MY VOTE WE'RE GONNA KEEP THIS PROCESS GOING YOU AND I'VE HAD. A FEW CONVERSATIONS AND I INTEND TO KEEP THAT COMMITMENT -- BUT ONE THEY HAVE ALSO OBSERVED AND PERHAPS I NEED TO BE HERE A BIT LONGER. IS THAT THERE'S TREMENDOUS EXPERTISE ONE ON THIS COMMITTEE INTO IN STAFF AND WITH THE AG. AND THAT. IT MAY BE BEST [inaudible] TO EXERCISE -- A LITTLE BIT OF OF CAUTION. IN WAIT UNTIL WE EMPLOY THIS EXPERTISE ONE MORE TIME. SO A DESK THAT YOU'D THINK ABOUT I TOLD ME TO KEEP MY COMMITMENT THINK ABOUT. ALLOWING US TO COME BACK AT THE NEXT HEARING WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX ALL THIS HENRY STEARNS SENATOR STERN'S GRANDCHILDREN GONNA BE WORKING ON THIS ISSUE -- SOME DAY -- SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO FIX IT IN A WEEK OR SO BUT BUT IT LEASE SO THAT WE CAN TO CENTER STERN'S POINT -- SEE WHAT DIRECTION SO. HAVING SAID THAT. THANK YOU TURNED BACK OVER THE VICE CHAIR -- SENATOR MONNING. THANK YOU AND I JUST HAVE A QUESTION. YEAH AS DRAFTED. THE BILL REQUIRES A CONSUMER TO OPT IN. TO RECEIVE CERTAIN PROTECTIONS. IF THAT CONSUMER IS DAMAGED. IN HIS NOT OPTED IN TO BE PROTECTED. DO THEY HAVE ANY REMEDY. SO WE TALK ABOUT A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENTLY WE DON'T WE DON'T THEY OFTEN WITH A REQUEST TO OPT OUT AND AND IT'S IT'S A LITTLE BIT. THUNDERBOLT BUT AT THIS POINT THE CONSUMER COULD NOT. BRING A PRIVATE ACTION UNLESS THERE IS A INVOLVING A BREACH OF THEIR PERSONAL INFORMATION AND SPECIFICALLY TIED TO CERTAIN DATA POINTS. AND THAT THE THE CONSUMER WOULD HAVE TO SHOW -- THAT THAT BREACH WITHIN DUE TO NEGLIGENCE. THE MECHANISM FOR ENFORCEMENT WOULD BE ALTERNATIVELY IF THE AG WERE LOOKING AT THE COMPANY TO SEE IF THEY HAVE VIOLATED THE LAW AND SO IN THAT RESPECT. THE WOULD NOT HAVE TO SHOW ANYTHING IN TERMS OF CONSUMER HARM. SO THE CONSUMER ONLY HAS REDRESS WITH RELATION TO PREACH IN A NARROW SCOPE -- FOR THE PURPOSES OF THE CPA AS IT'S WRITTEN RIGHT NOW NOT. NOT NOT CONSIDERING THE AMENDED LANGUAGE AND FIE SIXTY ONE AGAIN THROUGH THE CHAIR I THINK YOU HAVE A CLARIFICATION YES YES I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY CCPA IS NOT AN OPT IN IF THE RIGHTS THAT ARE IN THE KNOW THE RIGHT. OF NOTICE ACCESS AND SO FOR THOSE EXISTENCE SO I JUST WANT TO CLARIFY WITH THE DO NOT SELL. THERE'S AN OP RIGHT TO OPT OUT FOR ADULTS AND THEN FOR CHILDREN BUT COMPANIES ARE PROHIBITED FROM A CLASS SELLING INFORMATION WITHOUT PARENTAL CONSENT SO I JUST WANNA MAKE IT CLEAR WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT OFTEN LIKE EUROPE. THANK A BIT ON THAT THAT NARROW AREA OF SELLING OF INFORMATION. THE CONSUMER HAS TO TAKE AN AFFIRMATIVE STEP TO OPT OUT THAT'S RIGHT TO EXERCISE THEIR CHOICE AND DEMONSTRATE THEIR CHOICE. TO OPT OUT AND THAT WILL BE THEN HONORED BY COMPANIES THAT IS DIFFERENT THAN THE EUROPEAN SYSTEM. ACTION IS THIS IS IS OFTEN IN EUROPE YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT I THINK THAT -- IS DRYING -- THIS CONVERSATION TO TO A CLOSE -- I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM -- EVERYONE BY IN THE AUDIENCE WE'VE HEARD FROM THE MAKER OF THE THE THE ITEM -- THERE'S SAID. I WILL I WILL PROBABLY END. I WILL PROBABLY END JUST JUST WITH THIS THAT -- THAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE MAKER OF THE LEGISLATION. SO I THINK WE'VE HEARD FROM THE MAKER OF THE LEGISLATION THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PIECES OF DEVELOPMENT THAT NEED TO OCCUR. TO MAKE THIS I THINK -- BETTER WORKING MODEL. THAT. TO DATE THIS DRAFT DOES NOT. MOVE FORWARD IN A SUSTAINABLE WAY -- I THINK THERE ARE FAR TOO MANY UNCERTAINTIES THEY'RE FAR TOO MANY FUNDAMENTAL CHALLENGES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE TRADITIONAL LEGISLATIVE. EVOLUTIONARY PROCESS -- I WOULD -- AND CERTAINLY WELCOME -- THE MAKER OF THIS LEGISLATION -- TO TO MEET WITH THE INTERESTED PARTIES WHO HAVE EXPRESSED SINCERE WILLINGNESS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND -- AND IF IT IS INDEED. BY THE THE INTENT OF THE MAKER TO ACHIEVE COMPLIANCE. I THINK THAT THERE'S A WILL THERE'S A WAY FORWARD -- BUT I THINK AT THIS POINT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE -- TO LISTEN TO A A MOTION IF SOMEONE IS INTO IN IS INTENDING TO MAKE. ONE AND ALSO I THINK -- THERE'S ALWAYS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DECIDE TO BE BROUGHT BACK WITH SIGNIFICANT REVISIONS AT THE NEXT AVAILABLE MEETING AND IT'S ALMOST CERTAIN THAT THE CHAIR WOMAN. WOULD BE INTERESTED IN HAVING THIS ITEM RETURN SHOULD BE REQUIRED. BUT WITH THAT. DO WE HAVE A A A MOTION. IS THE HE IS THE AUTHOR GONNA MAKE A CLOSING STATEMENT I'D LIKE TO HEAR THAT -- CERTAINLY WHERE I CONSIDER MAKE. OKAY THANK YOU -- I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON THIS BILL. I AM COMMITTED TO DEALING WITH ALL THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN ADDRESSED I WANT TO KEEP IT MOVING SO THAT WE WILL HAVE ALL THE PARTIES AT THE TABLE -- AND I THINK THAT THE WAY THIS PROCESS WORKS THAT -- CERTAINLY I HAVE ALREADY GOTTEN A COMMITMENT FROM A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE AND GIVEN MY COMMITMENT THE ATTORNEY GENERAL HAS GIVEN HIS COMMITMENT. AND WITHOUT -- IT IS MY HOPE THAT WE CAN KEEP THIS CONVERSATION GOING I AM DELIGHTED THAT THE OPPOSITION WOULD LIKE TO SIT DOWN I'M. VERY INTERESTED IN WHAT THEY PROPOSE -- AND WITH THAT I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE A SO SO. YOU JUST SAY THAT TIME. WHEN I AM PREPARED TO MOVE IT TODAY? IN THAT WOULD BE MY MOTION. BUT I JUST HAVE TO SAY THAT THAT THERE'S A GRAVE CONCERN ABOUT THE CONDITION THAT IT'S AN AND I APPRECIATE THAT IF IT CONTINUES IN THIS CONDITION. THEN UNEQUIVOCALLY I WILL BE A NO BECAUSE I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S THE RIGHT. THE RIGHT DIRECTION I THINK THAT WE'VE HAD SOME GREAT INPUT HERE TODAY -- I'M WILLING TO SIT DOWN AND HAVE THE CONVERSATION AND I THINK THE INDUSTRY IS AS WELL THERE'S SOME SOME POSSIBLE SOLUTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN SUGGESTED -- I I LIKE SOME MORE THAN OTHERS AND WE'VE TALKED ABOUT THIS I KNOW YOU WON'T BE SURPRISED BY IT BUT BUT THERE IS -- I REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF OF EVERY BODY FEELING LIKE THERE'S AT A DIRECTION THAT WE'RE GOING IN. THAT PROVIDES ADVICE THAT PROVIDES -- SOME SOME OPPORTUNITY FOR PEOPLE TO KNOW WHERE THEY FIT ON ON THE SCALE BOB AND I THINK THAT THE MORE THAT WE SPEND TIME WORKING ON IT THE BETTER WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE SO -- WE HAVE A I LONG COME COMMITMENT. WE HAVE A GREAT COMMITMENT FROM THAT EIJI AND AND YOURSELF TO WORK ON IT AND SO I MAKE THE SAME COMMITMENT SO I'M I'M MOVE THAT WE UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT GOING TO END UP LOOKING LIKE THIS. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON I WOULD BE WONDERSTRUCK AND AGREE TO AND I APPRECIATE THAT I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS. WITH -- IT ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS AND SEE WHAT SEE IF WE CAN'T COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT'S GOING TO WORK FOR EVERYBODY. OR AT LEAST FOR A TO HAVE PEOPLE THAT WE CAN I DON'T KNOW THAT WE'LL EVER GET EVERYBODY ON BOARD AS WAS SAID THE CENTER STORAGE GRANDCHILDREN MIGHT BE. STILL -- DEALING WITH THIS BUT RIGHT NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH IT AND I WOULD ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. OKAY. SO WE HAVE A MOTION TO PASS IT TO SENATE APPROPRIATIONS -- OUTSIDE WE'LL FIND OUT THE RESULTS OF THIS ON THERE MAY BE A SECOND MOTION AFTERWARDS BUT COMMITTEE SECTOR WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL.
