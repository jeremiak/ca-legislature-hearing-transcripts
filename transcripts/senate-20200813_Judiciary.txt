EIGHT YEAH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS AB SIX SIXTY WOULD PROHIBIT LAW ENFORCEMENT FROMPARTICIPATING IN CO THAT NINETEEN RELATED CONTACT TRACING. AND PLACE PRIVACY PROTECTIONS ON DATA COLLECTED THROUGH CONTACT TRACING PROGRAMS. AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL INCLUDE TECHNICAL CLARIFICATIONS.

HUNDRED AND SIXTY THOUSAND CONFIRMED CASES OF COVERT NINETEEN AND OVER TEN THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS. HAVE DIED FROM THIS VIRUS NATIONALLY OVER ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY THREE THOUSAND AMERICANS HAVE DIED FROM THE CORONAVIRUS AN INTEGRAL PART. OF COMBATING COVE IN NINETEEN WILL BE THE USE OF CONTACT TRACING WHICH IDENTIFIES CODE NINETEEN POSITIVE INDIVIDUALS AND THOSE WHO HAVEBEEN IN CLOSE CONTACT WITH THEM. UNTIL A VACCINE IS AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC CONTACT TRACING IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT TOOLS AVAILABLE TO THEM AND CONTAINS SPREAD. OF THE CORONAVIRUS SUCCESSFUL IMPLEMENTATION OF CONTACT TRACING WILL REQUIRE PUBLIC CONFIDENCE IN THE ACTIONS TAKEN BY FEDERAL STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS. CALIFORNIA IS FORTUNATE TO HAVE OVER ELEVEN MILLION IMMIGRANTS INCLUDING AN ESTIMATED TWO MILLION UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS THAT CALL THE GOLDEN STATE HOME. THESE INDIVIDUALS HAVE INTEREST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY COAL NINETEEN. YET ARE LESS LIKELY TO SEEK MEDICAL AID OR PARTICIPATE IN CONTACT TRACING PROGRAMS CONDUCTED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE OF THEIR IN PATIENT STATUS. ONE FORTY AS A- FONG. TO PROTECT ME THROUGH HOW. YET THE DEPLOYMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT PERSONNEL TO CONDUCT CONTACT TRACING IS NOT. AN APPROPRIATE USE OF LIMITED PUBLIC RESOURCES AND IT IS IN FACT AN IMPEDIMENT TO EFFECTIVE CONTACT TRACING. EIGHTY SIX SIXTY BUILT UPON THE WORK OF OUR STATE TO RESPECT AND PROTECT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES BY PROHIBITING CONTACT TRACING ACTIVITIES BY A STATE OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY AND ENSURING. SENSITIVE INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH CONTACT TRACING IS NOT SHARED WITH FEDERAL IMMIGRATION OFFICIALS EIGHTY SIX SIXTY PROVIDES IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS FOR PERSONAL DATA.

SO THANK YOU TO ALL THOSE WITNESSES IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE FLOOR- I'D LIKE TO CHOOSE THE POINT OUT THAT IT. AS WE SEE WITH THIS BILL AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHARLES BILL AFFECTED CONTACT TRACING IS CRITICAL TO SUCCESSFULLY BATTLING THIS PANDEMIC WE NEED O IDENTIFY AND CONTACT THOSE THAT ARE INFECTED. FIGURE OUT WHO THEY MIGHT HAVE EXPOSED AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE ALL QUARANTINING AND SEEKING MEDICAL HELP IS APPROPRIATE WE DO NOT TAKE THE STEPS. WE ARE NOT GOING TO GAIN THE UPPER HAND ON THIS PANDEMIC I THINK IT IS AS SIMPLE AS THAT. AND OF COURSE ONE OF THE PRIMARY FACTORS FOR WHETHER A METHOD OF CONTACT TRACING WILL WORK IS THE PARTICIPATION AND OPENNESS THE WILLINGNESS OF PEOPLE TO GIVE THAT INFORMATION MUCH OF IT VERY PERSONAL AND PRIVATE INFORMATION. AS THE OXFORD DOCTOR AND RESEARCHER PUTS IT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ALL ABOUT BUILDING TRUST. THIS BILL IS ABOUT LAYING THE FOUNDATION FOR TRUST IT'S SIMPLE PROVISIONS ENSURETHE DATA THAT IS COLLECTED THROUGH CONTACT TRACING ISSUES FOR JUST THAT. CONTACT TRACING. CALIFORNIANS ARE GOING TO BE MORE APT TO SHARE THIS INFORMATION AND THEIR ASSOCIATIONS IF THEY KNOW THAT IT IS SLOWLY BEING USED TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND NOT BE USED TO TARGET THEM OR TO HELP THEM OR TO BE USED FOR MATH MEANS THAT DENY THEM THEIR PRIVACY AND THEIR SENSE OF PERSONAL SECURITY AND WHILE THERE MAY BE PRACTICAL DETAILS TO CONTINUE TO BE WORKED OUT AND WE HEARD ABOUT SOME OF THEM HERE AND I HAVE CONFIDENCE THAT THE- AUTHOR AND ARE COMMITTEE STAFF ARE HAPPY TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THIS- THINGS LIKE CONTACT TRACING IN PRISONS AND JAILS WHERE WE'VE HAD SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS. I THINK THE BILL'S A STRONG STEP FORWARD- FOR PROTECTING OUR PRIVACY AND ENSURING OUR COMMUNITIES TRUST THIS CONTACT TRACING PROCESS AND SO THAT'S SORT OF WHERE I'M COMING FROM I KNOW THAT WE HAVE A NUMBER OF MICROPHONES UP WE'LL START WITH THE SENATOR BORCHERS THEN SENATOR MELENDEZ AND THEN SENATOR Y. CASKEY SENATOR BORCHERS. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT. THE RIVER. YOU'RE CERTAINLY MAKING A SPLASH. I THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT- I THINK I WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY SUBMIT A- SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT POSITION I THINK- YOU QUOTED THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABOUT TRUST. I WOULD SUBMIT TO MY COLLEAGUES INTO THE PUBLIC. THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS ABOUT RESPONSIBILITY. AND I FIND IT VERY CHALLENGING TO SIMULTANEOUSLY. GET EVERYONE TO AGREE. THAT WE ARE IN A BONA FIDE EMERGENCY. NOT ONLY IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA IN OUR NATION BUT GLOBALLY. BUT THEN PUT FORWARD RULES THAT PRESCRIBE EXACTLY HOW WE ADAPT TO THE DOT THE DYNAMIC SITUATION OF THIS EMERGENCY. WHAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND ADDITIONALLY IS. WE HAVE AREAS OF THE STATE THEY DO NOT HAVE THE MEDICAL PERSONNEL. AND THE PERSON THE PERSONNEL CORPS. TO BE ABLE TO DO THE TYPE OF WORK THAT WE DEEM SO IMPORTANT IN UNDERSERVED AND CIRCUMSTANCES WOULD NEED TO INVOKE. INACTIVATE OTHER RESOURCES OF THE STATE SOMETIMES THAT COULD BE. INDIVIDUALS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT. SO I THINK I CAN BASED ON EARLIER PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT HAVE COME THROUGH. I BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ADEQUATE PROTECTIONS IN PLACE FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS THAT WOULD NORMALLY BE CONCERNED ABOUT DISCLOSING INFORMATION TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A RULE IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WHAT WAS IT SB FIFTY FOUR. TWENTY TWENTY SEVENTEEN SB FIFTY FOUR DISALLOWED LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM SHARING INFORMATION- WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT IN SUCH A WAY THAT IT WOULD- PUT IN JEOPARDY THEIR IMMIGRATION STATUS OR DISCLOSE IT IN THAT IN THAT FASHION. SO I GUESS IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT TACKLING THIS PANDEMIC. THEN WE NEED TO ACTIVATE ALL THE RESOURCES OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN YES IN CERTAIN INSTANCES THAT MAY INCLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT ESPECIALLY IN RURAL MOUNTAIN COMMUNITIES WHERE IT'S TERRIBLY RELEVANT. IN THEIR RELIED UPON IN THOSE SITUATIONS. SO FOR SERIOUS ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THIS DON'T HANDCUFF. THE EFFORTS UNDER WAY THAT COULD BE TERRIBLY USEFUL FOR US OVERCOMING OUR SITUATION SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY REQUEST MY COLLEAGUES. THIS IS ALREADY ADEQUATELY PROTECTED IN PRIOR LEGISLATION. THE IDEA THAT YOU WOULD STOP LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM PARTICIPATING AS NEEDED. LEAVE IT UP TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY HAVE THE RESOURCES. THAT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THEY WOULD NEED TO RELY ON LAW ENFORCEMENT LET THEM DECIDE. THE LEGISLATION ALREADY EXISTS THAT PROTECTS. ARE THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE FEARFUL THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. LITERALLY SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE THAT PERFECTLY THE WRONG TIME. DO YOU WISH TO RESPOND TO THAT A MERGER WAS A QUESTION BUT YOU HAVE A RESPONSE TO THAT- OR WOULD YOU RATHER RESPOND TO IT IN YOUR CLOSE OF ORANGE YEAH I THINK YOUR ATTENTION THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTION I RESPONDED IN MY CLOTHES THANK YOU- CENTER MELINDA'S. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE IT'S NICE TO SEE YOU I. I WANT TO DOVETAIL ON THE COMMENTS OF SENATOR BOARD JUST AND I HAVE A QUESTION FOR YOU. BECAUSE HE- BROUGHT UP A VERY. GOOD POINT THAT SB FIFTY FOUR. ALREADY PUT IN PLACE MEASURES THAT WOULD DISALLOW. LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM PART FROM COMMUNICATING WITH FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT FOR THE PURPOSES. OF IMMIGRATION SO. YOU HAVE IN THIS BILL EXCLUDED THEM- GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE ALREADY. HAVE SOMETHING IN PLACE TO DISALLOW THAT I'M- JUST CURIOUS AS TO WHY YOU SPECIFICALLY. EXCLUDED LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM YOUR BILL. IF YOU'D LIKE TO GO AHEAD AND ANSWER THAT. I WOULD ADDRESS FOR MY CLOTHES THANK YOU ALREADY YEAH NO NO NO NO THIS S. NOW THIS IS NOT LIKE THIS. THE FLOOR SESSION WHERE PEOPLE CAN PRESENT THEIR BILL AND THEN THE ANSWER SOMETHING OR NOT ANSWER SOMETHING THEIR CLOTHES THIS IS A COMMITTEE HEARING OR WERE DEBATING BILLS AND WE'RE BETTING THEM SO THAT WE CAN DECIDE. WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE WORTHY OF MOVING FORWARD FOR FULL SENATE VOTES ARE WOULD ASK MADAM CHAIR THAT. THE MEMBER ANSWER THE QUESTION OTHERWISE HOW CAN WE POSSIBLY MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ON THE BILL- A POINT WELL TAKEN- THE IF THIS IS PART OF A COLLOQUY RATHER THAN A STATEMENT- THAT DOESN'T. IT THAT ISN'T SEEKING THAT INTERACTION THEN CERTAINLY- ASSEMBLY MEMBER. PLEASE ANSWER PERHAPS THIS WILL LEAD TO SOME ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION AND IT ISN'T JUST A STATEMENT. I HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE HERE AND I DON'T HAVE FAITH THAT THIS WILL LEAD TO. SOME RABBIT HOLE- I DO RESPECT THE QUESTION AND SHE'S-ASKING AND I DO INTEND TO ADDRESS IT. I'M SORRY I MISSED THE LAST PART OF IT I DO INTEND TO ADDRESS IT BUT I'D LIKE TO HEAR FOR EXHAUSTIVE CONCERNED SO I CAN ADDRESS THEM AND HOLD. WELL I THINK. AGAIN IT IS. THIS IS A STRANGE PLACE TO BE HAVING. A CONVERSATION USUALLY WE DO IT IN A COMMITTEE ROOM. AND I THINK A CONVERSATION IS- IS WARRANTED IF THERE IS A DESIRE TO- CONTINUE. IN THAT FASHION AGAIN THERE'S A DIFFERENCE I SEE AT LEAST. BETWEEN MAKING A STATEMENT. AND GOING THROUGH- AN INQUIRY. SURE THANK YOU OKAY. ME PLEASE ASK YOUR QUESTION AGAIN. WELL MY QUESTION IS WHY WAS LAW ENFORCEMENT SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDED FROM YOUR BILL GIVEN THE FACT. THAT WE ALREADY HAVE PASSED A LAW THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THEM FROM COMMUNICATING AND COOPERATING WITH FEDERALLAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICIALS FOR THE PURPOSES OF IMMIGRATION SURE THIS IS JUST ONE SLICE OF WHAT THIS LEGISLATION ATTEMPTS TO DO. THAT LEGISLATION DOES MUCH MORE THAN THAT AND PROTECTING DATA OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE UNDERGOING CONTACT TRACING. BUT WHAT'S THE WHAT THE REAL GOAL HERE IN CONTACT TRACING HAVING IS HAVING A ROBUST SYSTEM. WE HAD VERY FEW RULES OR GUIDELINES WE'VE NEVER REALLY DONE THIS BEFORE AT SCALE. AND WITH THE TYPE OF EMERGENCY THAT WE ARE UNDER. SO THE GOAL SHOULD BE TO HAVE AS MUCH PARTICIPATION. IN CONTACT AS SOON AS POSSIBLE SO WHY NOT INCLUDE LAW ENFORCEMENT. SOON THEY'RE NOT THE ONES. THAT WE NEED TO ENCOURAGE PARTICIPATION FROM WE NEED TO HAVE PARTICIPATION FROM THOSE WHO EITHER HAVE CONTRACTED. OF THE NINETEEN OR MAY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO COPE AT NINETEEN AND EVERYTHING SHOWS US THAT THEY ARE NOT INTERESTED IN PARTICIPATING IN A CONTACT TRACING PROGRAM. THAT IS ENGAGED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT. OKAY SIR MADAM CHAIR I WON'T ASK ANY FURTHER QUESTIONS OF THE MEMBER I WILL JUST CONTINUE WITH MY OWN COMMENTS AND I AM VERY DISTURB FRANKLY THAT. THE SUGGESTION HAS BEEN MADE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT DOES NOT NEED TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PROGRAM WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN. INMATES HAVE HAD TO HAVE BEEN RELEASED% FROM OUR PRISONS BECAUSE OF A COVERT OUTBREAK AND THE PEOPLE WHO WORK IN THOSE INSTITUTIONS ARE LAW ENFORCEMENT THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY AT RISK IMPACT I WOULD ARGUE MORE SO. THEN SOME OTHER MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY SO I REALLY I'M- I'M SHOCKED THAT YOU WOULD SUGGEST THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT NEED NOT PARTICIPATE THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT NEED NOT BE PROTECTED. AND THAT THEY ARE NOT ALLOWED TO PARTICIPATE IN A PROGRAM BECAUSE YOU THINK THAT THEY MIGHT USE IT FOR PURPOSES OF IMMIGRATION WHICH WE'VE ALREADY SAID YOU CANNOT DO SO I THINK THAT. WE'RE TRYING TO PROTECT THE HEALTH OF ALL THE MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY THAT'S WHY WE'RE ALL WEARING MASKS AND WE'RE SOCIALLY DISTANCING AND I THINK WE OWE THAT TO OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COMMUNITY IS WELL TO PROTECT THEM TOO BUT TO SAY THAT. WE'RE GOING TO PROTECT EVERY OTHER PERSON IN CALIFORNIA EXCEPT YOU LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK THAT'S THAT'S A HORRIBLE. MESSAGE TO SEND AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING THAT I'M GOING TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU. UGH NEXT WITNESS WAS SENATOR Y. CASKEY AND I'LL HAVE A COMMENT ABOUT THAT AT SOME POINT BUT CENTER CASKEY THE FLOOR'S YOURS I KNOW THAT THERE'S AMENDMENTS AND I KNOW THAT THERE MAY BE SOME PRACTICAL DETAILS. I WANT TO HAVE A QUESTION MADAM CHAIR- WITH REGARD TO. LAW ENFORCEMENT AS THE EMPLOYER PART OF THE OBJECTION FOR THE OPPOSITION IS SAID OKAY I GET IT THAT THE GOAL SOMEBODY COMES TO THE JAIL TO GO TO TREE SOUTH WHO THAT. WHO THAT VISITOR WAS IN THEIR CONTACTS IN THE PROPONENTS IN THE- BASIS OF THIS BILLS PROTECTIVE BUT- PROTECT THOSE PEOPLE BUT- AS THE EMPLOYER WHO PRESUMABLY THIS COMMUNITY HAS BUILT SOME TRUST AMONGST. EMPLOYEE EMPLOYER OR MAYBE NO DIFFERENT FROM OTHER EMPLOYERS. WHAT IS THE- M. WELL. IS IT TRUE THAT THIS WOULD PROHIBIT. THE SHERIFF SAID THE LAW ENFORCEMENT AS EMPLOYERS FROM CONTACTING EMPLOYEES IN DOING CONTRACT CONTRACT CREASING HIS WITHIN THAT EMPLOYMENT. COMMUNITY ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE YES THANK YOU SO THE SO WE ARE WORKING ON CONCERNS AROUND THAT ISSUE AS WELL AS- WITHIN OUR PRISONS IN JAIL SO THERE THAT THAT IS WORK THAT IS ONGOING I KNOW THAT THE COMMITTEE IS WORKING ON THOSE AMENDMENTS AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT I ALSO WANT TO CLEAR UP- WHAT WAS A CLOSE KNIT CHRISTMAS REPRESENTS REPRESENTATION OF- THE BILL- WHICH IS OF COURSE WE WANT MEMBERS OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO PARTICIPATE IN CONTACT TRACING IF THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED OR CONTRACTED OCTOBER NINETEEN. AND THAT IS NOT OKAY AND THAT IS NOT PART OF THE BILL AND ALL THE OTHER PROVISIONS SIXTY DAYS AND THAT THAT THAT DATA ALL THAT. APPLIES IT CAN I WOULD NOTE THAT THIS THAT ISSUE THERE WAS ARTICULATED BY A CENTER MELINDA'S WAS RAISED IN THE- ANALYSIS AND THAT WITH AN INDICATION THAT IS BEING WORKED UPON. THERE'S A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN. BEING A SOMEONE WHO- DOES THE CONTACT TRACING IN GENERAL VERSUS AS AN EMPLOYER WITH YOUR EMPLOYEES AND I THINK THAT THAT. IS A LEGITIMATE CONCERN THAT IS BEING ADDRESSED BY THE AUTHOR NOW THE ISSUE IS. MAKING THAT INFORMATION AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT THE IN GENERAL. BUT FOR OTHER THAN THEIR OWN NEEDS AS AN EMPLOYER. AND I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT. THE XP FOR FOUR DOESN'T. NECESSARILY TAKE CARE OF THE ISSUE ABOUT THE INFORMATION BEING MADE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SADLY WE DO KNOW. THERE ARE INSTANCES WHERE LAW ENFORCEMENT IS TRYING TO CIRCUMVENT- SB FIFTY FOUR SO THIS WILL JUST. A TIGHT KNIT UP. AND FOCUS ON THE ISSUE OF CONTACT TRACING AND- ALSO THAT THERE ARE ASSURANCES IN YOUR CLOSER. ASSEMBLY MEMBER IF YOU WOULD COMMENT ON THE WORK THAT'S BEING DONE TO TRY TO IDENTIFY SHERIFFS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT IS EMPLOYER. DEALING WITH THE CONTACT TRACING ISSUE THAT WOULD I THINK US SOME. CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED WITH THAT WE HAVE A SENATOR NUMBER DO YOU HAVE YOUR BLUE HAND UP THERE FLOOR'S YOURS. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR ACT ACTUALLY THE QUESTIONS NOW BEEN ASKED I THINK I ANSWERED- ASPECTS OF THE WHITE HOUSE. AND RESOLVED- LEAST ABOUT RESOLVED ADDRESSED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE HAVE SENATOR STERN'S HAND UP BUT I DID SEE CENTER GONZALEZ WILL START WILL HAVE HER SPEAK AND THEN SENATOR STERN- WILL LET YOU CLOSE IT OUT. I JUST WANNA SALAS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND- BEING FROM THE LATINO CAUCUS AND SERVING A VERY A LARGE LATINO POPULATION I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MUCH I APPRECIATE THIS. THIS BILL- ESPECIALLY AS WE KNOW IT'S VERY CLEARLY STATED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT LATINOS DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED. BUT NOT ONLY THAT WE'RE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND WE NEED TO HAVE TRUST IN THE SYSTEM IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT IS ROBUST. ALSO AS THE CHAIR OF THE PANDEMIC COMMITTEE WE HAVE ABOUT TEN THOUSAND CONTACT TRACERS WHICH IS NOT ENOUGH WE KNOW WE NEED FORTY THOUSAND CONTACT TRACERS BUT AGAIN WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO BUILD TRUST IN THESE COMMUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO DO IT AFFECT. EFFECTIVELY AND EFFICIENTLY- MANY OF FOLKS ARE FEARING RETALIATION OR RETRIBUTION AND WE ABSOLUTELY NEED TO ENSURE THAT THIS BILL PASSES FOR THAT REASON. AND I ALSO APPRECIATE YOU- WORKING I KNOW YOU'LL CONTINUE TO WORK TO ENSURE THAT WE DO HAVE A ROBUST SYSTEM AND THAT THERE IS- AN OPPORTUNITY FOR PRISONS AND JAILS AND IN THOSE CONGREGATE FACILITIES WHERE WE KNOW WE'RE BEING. AFFECTED HERE IN THE STATES SO JUST WANTED TO SAY THANK YOU MY GRATITUDE FOR YOUR- FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR GONZALEZ AND SENATOR STERN WILL CLOSE IT OUT WITH YOU. I THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I CONCUR WITH MY COLLEAGUES FROM LONG BEACH ABOUT THE- CRITICAL NATURE TO GET SOME GUARDRAILS IN PLACE AND BUILD TRUST WITH COMMUNITIES SO WE ACTUALLY. CAN GET TRACERS ENROLLED- PEOPLE TRUSTING THE SYSTEM AND HOPEFULLY NIPPING THESE OUTBREAKS IN THE BUT BEFORE THEY GET. MORE DEADLY THAN THEY NEED TO BE- I DID WANT TO. JUST GET YOUR CONFIRMATION THAT THE AMENDMENTS AS I READ THEM- THE MOST IMPORTANT PROVISION I'VE SORT OF. KEYED IN ON FROM FROM WHAT I'VE SEEN IN PRINT HERE IS. THAT THERE THE BILL NOW DOWN IS NOT BORROWER- SORT OF INTER DEPARTMENTAL SHARING FOR INSTANCE. SO LONG AS THE CONTACT TRACING IS NOT USED TO MAINTAIN OR DISCLOSE FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN THE CONTACT TRACING EFFORTS UP I THOUGHT THAT. THAT CHANGE ACTUALLY PUT THE MOST IMPORTANT GUARDRAILS WHICH IS NO ONE'S GONNA USE YOUR CONTRACT TRADE CONTACT TRACING DATA FOR SOMETHING OTHER THAN WHAT IT'S BEEN COLLECTED FOR- BUT I ALSO I WANTED TO TRY TO GET YOUR SENSE WITH YOUR INTENT. TERMS THE DEFINITION YOU USE FOR CONTACT TRACING. AND HOW THAT DEALS WITH THE CURRENT PROHIBITION ON A LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES FROM ENGAGING. IN CONTACT TRACING- FIRM HOW I READ IT SAY A HYPOTHETICAL OF A OF THE UC CAMPUS- YOU HAVE A ALERT COMES OUT- AND THERE'S BEEN AN OUTBREAK AND STUDENTS IN SOME PARTICULAR DORM ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE- SO LONG IS THAT. THAT CAN'T POLICE OFFICER ISN'T THE ONE ACTUALLY DOING THE IDENTIFICATION AND THE MONITORING OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND THAT THAT THAT IDENTIFICATION MONITORING WORK IS BEING DONE BY INVEST IN THIS CASE YOU KNOW THAT THAT UNIVERSITY- THE BILL DOESN'T SEEM TO BORROWER- LAW ENFORCEMENT FROM- ACTING FOR INSTANCE AS AN AGENT OF THE PUBLIC HEALTH DEPARTMENT OR ASSISTING IN. STATE EVACUATING A DORM OR DEALING WITH IT IT GETS REALLY COMPLEX WHEN YOU HAE AN OUTBREAK SO I DID I JUST WANTED TO GET YOUR TAKE ON IT I DON'T READ I DON'T READ THIS AS AN ALL OUT BAR FROM LAW ENFORCEMENT SORT OF BEING- PERIPHERALLY ENGAGED WITH THE ARCHITECTURE BUT BUT NOT. THAT THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE IDENTIFIER AND THE MONITOR BECAUSE I DO I APPRECIATE YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING THEM OUTSIDE OF THEIR OWN SCOPE OF EMPLOYMENT AND THEIR WARSHIP- DUTIES- HAVING THAT BE THERE THERE THEM IS SORT OF THE PRIME ACTOR HE COULD YOU JUST YOU CAN DO IT IN YOUR CLOTHES OR OR NOW BUT I. I WANTED TO GET YOUR SENSE IN THAT HYPOTHETICAL. DO YOU INTEND FOR THAT. YOU KNOW THERE'S NEVER TO DORM CONNECT POLICE OFFICER GROUP HELP WITH THAT EFFORT OF IT AS LONG AS THEY'RE NOT THE MAIN IDENTIFIER AND MONITOR. THANK YOU SENATOR STERN AND IF YOU WOULD ADDRESS THAT THE SINGH NO OTHER- MIKE'S UP SO IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AND ADDRESS THAT ISSUE AS WELL. WE SHOULD THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU SENATOR STERN FOR YOUR QUESTION THAT DOVETAILS- YOU MIGHT NOT THINK IT DOVETAILS WITH DETAILS A LITTLE BIT IN INTO- THE CONCERNS I UNDERSTAND AND- I THAT WERE ALSO RAISED BY SENATOR PORGES. OF COURSE YOU WANT TO PRESERVE THE ABILITY FOR PEACE OFFICERS TO DO THEIR JOB- AND- I'M VERY GLAD TO HEAR FROM YOU SEE AND OTHERS- THAT HER HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THEIR ABILITY TO COORDINATE- IN- IN THE RULES THAT THEY DO- THAT ALSO PRESERVES THE RELATIONSHIPS THAT THEY HAVE. WITH THOSE COMMUNITIES. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE RESOURCES ARE THERE. FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SWORN PEACE OFFICERS TO PLAY THE IMPORTANT ROLE THAT THEY PLAY EVERY DAY. THEY ARE. NECESSARY BUT ALSO EXPENSIVE RESOURCES. CONTACT TRACING DOES NOT NEED TO USE THE SAME- RESOURCES. AND ALSOCAN BENEFIT FROM- FROM TRUST BUILT OUT. ON BECAUSE OF. THAT THEY'RE NOT INVOLVED WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT AND SO WE KNOW DESPITE. SB FIFTY FOURTH PASSAGE THAT THERE STILL IS A GREAT DEAL OF MISTRUST- IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES- TOWARDS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND- AND SO WE DON'T WANT THAT TO BE A BARRIER. TO ROBUST CONTACT TRACING AND I HOPE THAT THAT- DOES ANSWER QUESTIONS WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK. WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ABLE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS. AND INTO YOUR POINT ABOUT PRISONS MADAM CHAIR. THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE I'VE BEEN WORKING ON- SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE PANDEMIC AND SADLY WE HAD. ONE PRISON GUARD AT SAN QUENTIN SUCCUMB TO- CODE NINETEEN JUST THIS PAST WEEKEND WE LEARNED TODAY OF ANOTHER PRISON STAFF MEMBER AT FOLSOM WHO PASSED AWAY SADLY INTO WHAT APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER OUTBREAK OF COVER NINETEEN AT. YET ANOTHER STATE PRISON AT FOLSOM. AND SO WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PROTECT EVERY CALIFORNIANS NO MATTER WHERE THEY ARE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR STEADFAST FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WITH THAT- MADAM CONSULTANT. HOLD ON ONE SECOND. MOVE THE BILL YES WE DO HAVE A MOTION BY- CENTER WHERE I. CAL SKI THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR MAKING THAT MOTION I'M STILL HAVING A LITTLE TROUBLE ORIENTING I'M MORE CUSTOM TO PRESIDING OVER THE FLOOR SESSIONS THAN A COMMITTEE SESSION HERE SO.

STERN BY- BURKE I. I THINK YOU HAVE TO SAY YOUR NAME SIR MARGAI THANK YOU- BURKE I WHITE HOUSE SKI HI WHITE HOUSE GATE I. SIX ZERO ZERO. THE VOTE COUNT IS SIXTY TWO WE WILL HOLD THE ROLE OPEN FOR OUR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEVINE THE MEASURE WORKING MEMBERS THANK YOU. OUR NEXT OF FILE ITEM. WILL BE FILE ITEM FOR AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER CHAU BEING PRESENTED TODAY BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. MY UNDERSTANDING IS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAU IS. OF ILL TODAY AND NOT ABLE TO PRESENT HIS OWN BILL BUT WE DO HAVE THE CHAIR OF ASSEMBLY JUDICIARY COMMITTEE- MR STONE THE FLOOR'S YOURS THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND AN MEMBERS FIRST ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR WORKING AND YOUR STAFF WORKING WITH THEM ON THIS VERY. IMPORTANT BILL BUT IT BUT ULTIMATELY VERY NARROW BILL DEALING WITH CONTACT TRACING. ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHAD CHAIRS THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION COMMITTEE SO THIS IS THESE ARE ISSUES THAT ARE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM. AND YES CONTACT TRACING IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DEAL WITH THE PANDEMIC AND ULTIMATELY COME OUT OF THE PANDEMIC AND MANAGE THE RISKS THAT ARE HERE. AND I THINK WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE ALL THE APPROPRIATE METHODS OF CONTACT TRACING THAT ARE POSSIBLE INCLUDING THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND THIS BILL IS APPROACH IS. DEALING WITH TECHNOLOGY ASSISTED CONTACT TRACING AND ALL IT REALLY DOES IS PROVIDE SOME LIMITATIONS. ON THE USE OF THE TECHNOLOGY BY REQUIRING AFFIRMATIVE CONSENT FOR THE COLLECTION USE MAINTENANCE AND DISCLOSURE OF AN INDIVIDUAL DATA THROUGH THESE APPLICATIONS. INCORPORATE THE BUSINESS INCORPORATES THE CONCEPT OF DATA MINIMIZATION SO THAT IT ENSURES THAT IF AN APP IS BEING USED IT FOR CONTACT TRACING IT IS BEING USED ONLY FOR CONTACT TRACING. AND NOTHING BEYOND. ANYTHING THAT THAT IS OTHERWISE REASONABLY NECESSARY TO REVIVE TECHNOLOGICALLY ASSISTED CONTACT TRACING AND THEN PROHIBITS ANY DISCRIMINATION OR PENALTY BASED ON WHETHER AN INDIVIDUAL PARTICIPATES IN THIS TECHNOLOGY ASSISTED CONTACT TRACING SO SOMEONE IS NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THE APPLICATION WITH THE DATA BEING COLLECTED THEY CAN OPT OUT AND NOT THEN BE PENALIZED FOR THAT THERE ARE NO LIMITATIONS ON OTHER TYPES OF CONTACT RACING THERE'S NO LIMITATIONS ON THE ABILITY TO GATHER AND MANAGE THE DATA THAT'S ULTIMATELY NECESSARY. BU THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT TOOL THAT WILL HELP FACILITATE THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY APPLICATIONS IN CONTACT TRACING AND ENSURE THAT IT IS BEING DONE IN A WAY THAT DOES NOT. PUT ANYONE'S PRIVATE. DATA AT AT RISK OF PRIVACY AT RISK. SO AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE THIS IS AN AUTHOR SPONSORED BILL I PRESENT. TO BE ABLE TO PRESENTED HERE TODAY THERE ARE TWO LEAD WITNESSES MAUREEN MAHONEY FROM CONSUMER REPORTS. AND NEED A WIDER FROM THE A RP AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE- WE HAVE TWO KEY WITNESSES MAIN WITNESSES YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES FOR A TOTAL OF FOUR MINUTES JUST DEPENDING UPON HOW YOU WISH TO DIVIDED. AND IF WE COULD START WITH THE- MS MAHONEY IS SHE ON THE LINE. YEAH AFTER MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY MY NAME IS MAUREEN MAHONEY POLICY ANALYST THE CONSUMER REPORTS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO TO PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF INFORMATION COLLECTED PURSUANT TO TECHNOLOGIES THAT THE CONTACT TRACING APPS. THIS WILL HELP INSURE THAT THEY HAVE IF THEY ARE INTRODUCING CALIFORNIA WILL BE SAFER AND MORE EFFECTIVE FOR EXAMPLE AND LET THE MAJORITY CONSUMER UC'S OUT. THEY'LL BE MUCH USEFUL IN HELPING TO CONTAIN CODE NINETEEN. ROLLED OUT NOW SURVEY DATA SUGGESTS THAT TOO MANY CONSUMERS WILL BE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL PRIVACY HARMS TO PARTICIPATE. ABOUT HALF OF AMERICANS WITH SMARTPHONES PROBABLY OR DEFINITELY WOULD NOT USE THE THAT. IN LARGE PART DUE TO. THE POTENTIAL THREAT. POSED TO CONSUMER PRIVACY. WATER MAKING SEEN WHETHER STATE OF. WILL AND WILL THESE UP CONSUMERS NEED TO CRY. AND SECURE. IN PLACE SO THAT THERE'S NO GAP IN PROTECTIONS. IF IT ALL OUT QUICKLY ALREADY IN OTHER COUNTRIES IS INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THESE OUT. IF YOU THINK COURTS OF WAYS SUCH AS TO ORPHALI QUARANTINE OR OTHERWISE LIMIT THE ACTIVITY OF USERS DESPITE THE THREAT. OF FALSE POSITIVE. THIS WILL HELP INSURE THAT. PERSON INTERESTED UP DEVELOPING TO MARKETING. WILL BE PROTECTIVE THE SOUTH OF THE STRONG STANDARD OF DATA MINIMIZATION OF ANY COLLECTION SHARING MAINTENANCE AND DISCLOSURE OF DATA TO ITS RECENTLY OP. NECESSARY TO OPERATE THE SERVICE. THIS MEANS I CAN VIEW MY PRIVACY. IS ENSURED BY DEFAULT RATHER THAN LEAVING IT TO THE CONSUMER TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO EXERCISE THEIR PRIVACY PREFERENCES. OF COURSE NOT EVERY CONSUMER WOULD WANT TO SUBJECT THEMSELVES THE DATA COLLECTION IN THE FIRST PLACE SO APPROPRIATELY CONSENT FOR USE AS REQUIRED. OFTEN IS IMPORTANT TO CIRCUMVENT. OUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE TCPA. COCKTAIL MODEL HAS BEEN THAT. SOME COMPANIES ARE PUTTING. UP IT IS A STRONG NOT. PROVISION TO HELP ENSURE THE CONSUMER HAVE A MEANINGFUL CHOICE. AS TO WHETHER OR NOT TO PURCHASE. ADDITIONALLY WE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE COMMITTEE AND AUTHOR OF TO STRENGTHEN. INCLUDE IN THIS BILL. THIS FROM CONSUMER IMPORTANT PARTY. AND WE ARE.

THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE MAIN SWAT MUHAMMAD AL CHAMBER WE'RE OPPOSED TO I. EIGHTY SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TWO AT THE OUTSET OF PORTENT ANOTHER CONTACT TRACING DURING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC IS A CRITICAL PUBLIC HEALTH SAFETY WITH AN IMPORTANT PRIVACY COMPONENT. IT'S NOT A PRIVACY ISSUE IN THE PUBLIC HEALTH COMPONENT WE HAVE NO TREATMENT FOR KOBE CONTACT TRACING NEXT TO TESTING SOCIAL DISTANCING ACCORDING TO ONE OF THE TOOLS WE'VE GOT WE CAN'T QUARANTINE EVERYONE TESTING AND ONGOING ISSUE AND THEREFORE CONTACT TRACING THE BEST WE HAVE CLOSED AND- MANUAL CONTACTING IS. IT TAKES DAYS REGION BACK IN PERSON REQUIRES YOU TO DISCLOSE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO A STRANGER WORKING FOR THE GOVERNMENT WITHOUT DISCLOSURES AND WITHOUT KNOWING WHO WILL SEE IT WORKS OR HOW LONG IT WILL PROTECT THE ADVANTAGE TO VISUAL CONTACT TRACING A SIMPLE IT SAVES LIVES BUT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY TO WORK AS AN EFFECTIVE PROHIBITION AGAINST THE USE OF CONTACT TRACING TECHNOLOGIES. WITH COMPLEX AND THEY PROVISIONS ALLOWING FOR ITS USE IN LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES GIVEN CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET INCLUDING THE SURRENDER OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ALL INVENTIONS TO THE GOVERNOR. AND EVEN THE NONPROFIT THAT'S COOL UNIVERSITY READ A PUBLIC ENTITY SATISFIED THESE NARROW CIRCUMSTANCES IT WOULD STILL BE SUBJECT TO COSTLY LITIGATION INCLUDING ATTORNEY'S FEES WHICH CAN BE AWARDED INTO QUESTIONS ONE VIOLATIONS DID NOT EVEN RESULT IN THE DISCLOSURE OF DATA. AN ENTITY CAN'T. EVEN SEND AN EXPLOSION LOCATION UNLESS IT'S APPROVED BY A CHAIN OF COMMAND SET FORTH UNDER THE BILL AND THIS CREATES A LEGITIMATE INTANGIBLE DETERRENT FOR USING THIS TECHNOLOGY AT ALL. FURTHER THE BILL ENABLES ENFORCEMENT OR CIVIL ACTION BY THE AGP ANYTHING IT TURNING OR THE VISUALS THIS IS BROADER THAN WHAT IS. ALLOWED UNDER BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS. WE DFI CLAIM IT LIMIT TO JUST THAT JURISDICTION OF THE CAN BE AND YOU. ANOTHER IN THE TO THAT THE OR SOME. CLAIM WELL THE MALL AND FOR ACTIONS THE SAME VIOLATION AND TO RECEIVE YOUR- THE BUSINESS OF. BECAUSE I DON'T. HOW ANNUAL SHOULD BE TO. AMONG AGENTS WHICH EIGHTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO BILLS OF ALL OF OUR- WHICH COULD LEAD TO MORE. AGE RUN INTO IN. THE BILL FIRST RECOVERY DAMAGE. SO WE WILL THAT THERE A PATH THAT IS BEING THE POKE PUBLIC AND KEEP THE CURRENT BURGEONING AB SEVEN. EIGHTY TWO JUST DOESN'T A CHEAP BALANCE AND ALL THREATENED THE SAFETY. GUARD STATE THESE ARE JUST FEW THE RE THAT WE HAVE. THEM THANK FOR THE TIME THAT I. THANK YOU I GUESS YOU'RE TO THANK YOU MISTER. YOU ABOUT MINUTE AND. FOR FIVE. THANK YOU MAY CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE- MY NAME. CORRECT AND HERE I BEHALF OF THE COMPUTING. INDUSTRY WE ARE RESPECT OPPOSED. SEVEN EIGHTY. I WOULD LIKE TO BE THREE IN. POINTS FIRST WOMAN TO DISCUSS. ABOUT THE BILL FOCUS ON PRIVACY THE BILL'S ACTUALLY ABOUT WHETHER CALIFORNIA CAN CYCLE THAT AND SAY BY. KOBE NINETY HAD OBVIOUSLY WRECKED HAVOC ON OUR STATE SCHOOLS ARE CLOSE TO DOUBLE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN DECIMATED. FOR NEARLY FIVE MONTHS CALIFORNIA HAS ALL BUT SHUT DOWN. CALIFORNIA HAD TO PASS THE DENTAL OF OVER TEN THOUSAND DEATHS DUE TO COVERT NINETEEN. CONTACT TRACING AS MR MUHAMMAD SAID IS ONE OF THE ONLY TOOLS WE CURRENTLY HAVE IN FIGHTING THE VIRUS. TO DATE THERE IS NO VACCINE AND THERE IS NO CURE. SECOND AB SEVENTY TWO DID NOT DISTINGUISH CONTACT TRACING WITHIN THE EMPLOYMENT CONTEXT EMPLOYERS NEED TO BE ABLE TO KEEP THEIR WORKERS SAFE. THIS BILL HINDERS THE EMPLOYER'S ABILITY TO TAKE PROPER SAFEGUARDS IN OUR WORKPLACES. AND CREATE POWERFUL DISINCENTIVES FROM EVEN ATTEMPTING TO DO SO BECAUSE OF THE POTENTIAL RISK OF THAT. ASHTRAY DAMAGES AND CLASS ACTION LITIGATION. FOR EXAMPLE THE BILL DISCRIMINATION LANGUAGE BECAUSE OF OUR ACTIONS LIKE MOVING AN EMPLOYEE WHO CHOOSES NOT PARTICIPATE IN TACT. A LOWER RISK AREA AN ELDERLY HOME OR PROHIBITING THE EMPLOYEES FROM WORKING UNTIL THEY'VE QUARANTINED. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL ALLOWS EMPLOYEES TO OPT OUT OF CONTACT READING PROGRAMS ANYTIME. THEREBY PREVENTING PROMPT WARNING TO OTHER WORKERS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN EXPOSED TO SOMEONE WHO HAS TESTED POSITIVE. THIRD AB SEVENTY TWO COMPLEX IS CURRENTLY BURNING POINT LOSS WORKPLACE SAFETY REQUIREMENTS AND DIRECTLY CONTRADICT RECENT GUIDANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THE TEACHERS WORKPLACE KIND CONSTRUCTION FOR YEARS TO DEVELOP MECHANISMS. FOR TRACKING SUSPECT SUSPECTED AND CONFIRMED CASES OF INFECTED EMPLOYEES. I EAT CONTACT TRACING. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES THE BUSINESS TO DELETE ANY DATA COLLECTED PURSUANT TO TAX WITHIN THIRTY SIXTY DAYS. HOWEVER THERE ARE MYRIAD OF IMPLEMENT DOCUMENT RETENTION REQUIREMENTS OF THIS BILL FAILS TO CONSIDER. FOR EXAMPLE INPUT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY- WE'VE GONE EVEN THE TIME TERRY DEPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND WITH THAT- LET'S SEE IF THERE'S ANYONE. IN THE- BILL HERE A- ON THE FLOOR. TO SEE. IN THE CHAMBER IS NO.

SENATOR NUMBER WAS THE FIRST ONE TO PUT HIS HAND UP OR MICROPHONE UP WE WILL START WITH SENATOR NUMBER. THEN SENATOR BORCHERS AND THEN CENTER MONNING SO SENATOR BORCHERS OF EXCUSE ME UNDER THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR IN IT ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE- PERHAPS WELL IF YOU CAN RESPOND THE QUESTION GREAT IF NOT PERHAPS ONE OF THE PROPONENTS. SO THIS IS THIS IS A CLASSIC CASE WERE BOUNCING VALUES THE- POLICY THE VALUE IN PRIVACY VERSUS OF MAKING SURE THAT THE WORK FORCE STAYS HEALTHY SO. HYPOTHETICALLY IF. AN EMPLOYEE SAYS YOU KNOW I DON'T WANT TO CONSENT TO MY INFORMATION BEING DISSEMINATED ANY SHAPE. OR FORM- AND I EVEN DON'T WANT TO TELL YOU WHETHER OR NOT I HAVE CLOTHES THAT ARE NOT UP. WHAT HAPPENS TO THE WORK FORCE IF YOU SUSPECT THAT PERSON IS CALLED IT DO YOU NEED TO HAVE ALL THE OTHER ORKERS ISOLATE THEMSELVES YOU ISOLATE THAT PERSON HOW DOES THAT HAPPEN. YEAH YEAH. THE EMPLOYEE DOESN'T PROVIDE CONSENT THAT'S ITEM ONE AND ITEM TWO IS IT. IT SEEMS TO ME THAT. WHEN YOU BECOME AN EMPLOYEE THAT YOU YOU DON'T GIVE UP- CERTAIN RIGHTS OR CERTAIN CONDITIONS OF EMPLOYMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE USE OF YOUR COMPUTER SHOWING UP AT A CERTAIN TIME- OBSERVING WORKPLACE DECORUM THAT THAT YOU- UNDERSTANDING YOUR EMPLOYMENTS CONDITION UPON ALL THOSE. SO ASSEMBLY MEMBER SO IF YOU COULD RESPOND IF NOT PRESS ONE OF. THE STATE THANK YOU CEREMONY TICKET TAKE A CRACK AT THAT A LOT OF WHAT YOU'RE ASKING RELEASED BEYOND THE SCOPE OF. WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IT IT'S TALKING ABOUT ONE PARTICULAR TOOL FOR CONTACT TRACING. NOT THE MULTIPLE MEASURES THAT THAT NEED TO BE USE IN ORDER TO ULTIMATELY DO CONTACT TRACING. AND I OPTED. HERE ARE MERELY AN EMPLOYEE BEING ABLE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THE APPLICATION. AND SAYING I DON'T WANT TO USE THAT APPLICATION BECAUSE OF THE IMPLICATIONS IF YOU LOOK AT SOME OF THE APPS THAT ARE BEING USED FOR CONTACT TRACING. SOME OF THEM. ARE ASKING FOR TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF INFORMATION THAT WE DON'T NORMALLY GIVE TO OUR EMPLOYERS A LOT OF IT BEING HEALTH INFORMATION. WHERE YOU GO WHEN YOU'RE NOT ON THE PREMISES. WHO YOU'RE INTERACTING WITH WHEN YOU'RE NOT ON THE PREMISES. NONE OF THE BILL THE COMPANY THE ORGANIZATION'S BUSINESS. AND YET. IN FOR AN APP TO BE LOADED ON SOMEBODY'S PHONE. OR EVEN ON A COMPANY PHONE. THAT IS THEN BEING ALLOWED TO BE TAKEN OFF PROMISES AND USED. WITH SOME. PERSONAL INFORMATION AND THAT. HAVING AN APPLICATION THAT MAY. GO BEYOND WHAT THAT EMPLOYEES EXPECTATIONS ARE THAT EMPLOYMENT RELATIONSHIP IS NOT SOMETHING THAT WE WANT TO FACILITATE HERE. THAT THERE COULD BE VERY SIMPLE APPLICATIONS. THAT THERE COULD BE VERY COMPLEX APPLICATIONS AND WHAT THE BILL IS TRYING TO DO. IS JUST ASK FOR THAT CONSENT TO BE ABLE TO DOWNLOAD THAT APPLICATION AND PUT IT ON THE PHONE. AND THEN ENSURE THAT THAT THAT THAT APPLICATION IS AS RESTRICTED AS POSSIBLE. BUT THAT THAT ULTIMATELY BECOMES FAIRLY NEBULOUS IS RESTRICTED POSSIBLE JUST TO. DO CONTACT TRACING BUT WHAT THIS BILL IS NOT TRYING TO DO IS LIMIT WHAT DOES THAT MEANS IT'S JUST TRYING TO SAY THAT THAT YOU NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE NOT ASKING FOR ANYTHING BEYOND WHAT'S NECESSARY FOR CONTACT TRACING NOW. THE APPLICATION COULD ASK FOR SYMPTOMS. WHICH IS AGAIN HEALTH INFORMATION IT IF IT'S VOLUNTEERED BY THE EMPLOYEE THAT'S A WAY AROUND HIM FOR PROTECTION. BUT YET IT'S A PART OF THE APPLICATION. SO OFTEN PLOY HE THAT IS THINK I DON'T WANT TO DOWNLOAD THE APPLICATION. THEY'RE STILL SUBJECT TO THE QUESTIONS TO THE CONTACT RACING TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE SUBJECT TO. AN AND- IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE SEPARATED IF THERE'S QUARANTINES THAT'S THAT'S WELL BEYOND REALLY WHAT. WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND SO FOCUSING ON ON. THE APPLICATION HERE. AND RECOGNIZING THAT IT IS A TOOL. BUT IS IT IT'S A TOOL THAT COULD PROLIFERATE INFORMATION WELL BEYOND WHAT THE EMPLOYER WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE A RIGHT TO. WHAT THE EMPLOYER WOULD REALLY NEED FOR WHAT THE EMPLOYEES EXPECTATIONS ARE. THAT'S REALLY WHAT THE LIMITATION AS I SEE THIS AS A TOOL. TO FACILITATE APPLICATIONS. AND HOPEFULLY WE WILL SEE APPLICATIONS IN THIS SPACE BUT MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE NOT ABUSED AND THAT THEY'RE NOT. UNNECESSARILY TAKING THAT THE DATA OF AN EMPLOYEE AND PUTTING IT TO OTHER USE. AND THANK. I ASK FOLLOW PLEASE PLEASE DO. I'M SO I UNDERSTAND THAT AND I UNDERSTAND THE CONCERN WITH FOR EXAMPLE GEOLOCATION OUTSIDE THE WORKPLACE. BUT IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS IT DOES SEEM TO ME THAT THAT WE WANT TO BE AS- EFFICIENT AS POSSIBLE PARTICULARLY IN WORK PLACES WITH LARGE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT WE CAN DO CONTACT TRACING AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE. AND TO THE EXTENT THAT EMPLOYEE- DOES HAVE SOME OF HIS OR HER PRIVACY RIGHTS- IMPACTED THE THAT THIS MAY BE A TIME WHERE WE NEED TO DO STUFF BUT I'LL LEAVE THAT. UP I HAVE I HAVE CONCERNS STRONG CONCERNS. IN APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS VERY WILLING TO WORK THROUGH THE COMMITTEE AND MAKE SURE THAT SOME OF THOSE CONCERNS TO GET ADDRESSED BECAUSE AGAIN I BELIEVE MISTER CHARLES GOALS NOT TO PROHIBIT THE APPS OR MAKE IT IMPOSSIBLE FOR THEM TO WORK. BUT TO SET A CLEAR EXPECTATION FOR THE EMPLOYEE WHEN THEY DOWNLOAD THAT APP WHEN THAT HAPPENS TRACKING THEM. AND IT IN PLACES THAT THAT IN IN WAYS THAT THEY MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE OTHERWISE THE ANTICIPATED. AND I THINK IT'S A DANGEROUS ROAD TO STEP DOWN AND I KNOW WE HAVE TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO DO CONTACT TRACING. BUT BECAUSE OF THE POWER OF THESE DEVICES AND THEIR ABILITY. TO COLLECT MANAGE AND DISTRIBUTE INFORMATION FAIRLY BROADLY. INCLUDING IF IT IS A THIRD PARTY. APPLICATION THAT EMPLOYER NOW IS ASKING TO BE DOWNLOADED ON SOMEBODY'S. PHONE IF THAT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE APP PROVIDER AND THE EMPLOYER OR ARE NOT CLEAR ENOUGH. THEN THAT DATA CAN GO. WHO KNOWS WHERE IT COULD IN FACT BE OWNED BY THE APPLICATION. AND THE APPLICATION DEVELOPER AND THEIR COMPANY RATHER THAN EVEN THE EMPLOYER. SO IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S CLEAR THEN YES I WOULD EXPECT A LOT I WOULD CERTAINLY NOT WANT TO SIGN UP FOR THAT. BUT I WOULD WANT TO HAVE THE OPTION TO BUY A PLAYER CAME TO ME AND SAID WE WANT TO YOU CONTACT TRACING THIS IS ONE OF THE TOOLS WE WANT TO USE. TAKE A LOOK AT IT IF YOU THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD ENOUGH JOB.CONSENT TO IT AND THN WE CAN COVER THAT GROUND IF NOT THE EMPLOYER MAY NEED TO DO. TO AUGMENT THE APPLICATION. FOR THOSE WHO DO NOT WANT TO SUBSCRIBE. WITH OTHER METHODS TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH OTHER METHODS. THANK YOU BYE NEXT UP IS SENATOR BORCHERS. THIS IS CERTAINLY A BALANCING ACT I THINK. LAST YEAR WE SPENT A GOOD AMOUNT OF TIME ON PRIVACY RELATED MATTERS IN FACT ON THE CHAIR AND NINE FIVE SPENT- EVEN MORE TIME ON RESEARCHING. HOW OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD ARE MANAGING PRESERVATION OF PRIVATE DATA. SO WHAT WE HAVE HERE IS WE HAVE. CONSTITUTIONAL EXPECTATIONS AND WE HAVE A BONA FIDE EMERGENCY. I IN I GUESS I'D LIKE TO ASK QUESTIONS I MAY THROUGH THE CHAIR TO. THE THIS IS NOT THE ALTERNATOR FINE JOB OF MY DAD. HEY WHY IS THIS NOT MANDATORY CAN YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU RECITE JUST A LITTLE BIT ON THE RATIONALE AS TO WHY THIS WAS NOT- WHY THIS DIDN'T GO THE DIRECTION OF A MANDATORY- POLICY BUT- I GUESS IN A CLEAR ON THE QUESTION THAT IT'S NOT MANDATING WHAT WHAT IS IT YEAH BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THIS IS VOLUNTARY THAT THE INDIVIDUAL CAN. THE RULES ARE THAT WOULD GO ALONG WITH THIS- WOULD PROTECT DATA BUT THE TRACING ITSELF IT WOULD BE VOLUNTARY FOR THOSE THAT WISH TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS EVENT A TERRY AGAIN THIS BILL HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CONTRACT TRACING PER SE IT ONLY HAS THE IT'S WITH APPLICATION SO THAT THE CONTACT TRACING. ITSELF THIS IS SILENT ON AND DOESN'T DEAL WITH THAT IT'S REALLY IF THE IF THE EMPLOYER WANTS TO USE A PARTICULAR APPLICATION AGO RIGHT THERERIGHT YOU THINK IT WOULD USE A PARTICULAR APPLICATION. THEN THE WHAT THIS IS SAYING IS THAT CANNOT BE MADE. OBLIGATORY ON AN EMPLOYEE THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I'M GETTING AT YEAH SO WHY IS IT SO YOU'RE GIVING THE EMPLOYEE THE WITH THE OPTION TO DOWNLOAD THE APP OR WHATEVER FORM OF TECHNOLOGY. THE PRESS. WHY IS IT IS IN THAT. MADE MANDATORY WHAT HAS BEEN EMPLOYEE MUST. SUBSCRIBE THEM SELVES TO THIS TYPE OF SERVICE THAT WOULD HELP THE PUBLIC FOR PURPOSES OF TRACING DOWN THE ROAD OKAY BECAUSE BUT I THINK THAT'S A LITTLE BIT OF ALARMING PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE THE EMPLOYEE NONE OF US KNOW WHAT THAT APPLICATION IS. THE DATA THAT IT COLLECTS WHO OWNS THAT DATA HOW IT'S BEING USED AND SO FOR AN EMPLOYER WHO MAY OR MAY NOT HAVE DONE THEIR RESEARCH AND ARE JUST BUYING AN APPLICATION AND SAY YOU MUST USE THIS APPLICATION. THREE DIFFERENT THAT AN EMPLOYER INSTALLING. THE WORD PROCESSING APPLICATION ON THE COMPUTERS AND SAY YOU MUST USE THIS I'VE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION AND IT'S BEEN VERY DEVASTATING WHEN IT'S AN APPLICATION THAT I DON'T PARTICULARLY CARE FOR. BUT I DON'T HAVE A CHOICE IN THAT CASE IN THIS CASE. THE APPLICATION CAN HAVE SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT PERSONAL ISSUES FOR THAT EMPLOYEE AND IF THE EMPLOYER HASN'T DONE THEIR JOB AND WE MANDATE THAT THE EMPLOYEE NOW DOWNLOADS. THE WHATEVER IT HAPPENS TO BE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT SPECIFYING WHAT THE APPLICATION IS WE'RE JUST SAYING THAT YOU CAN'T. HOISTED ON AN EMPLOYEE NOW IF THE EMPLOYER HAS DONE THEIR JOB. AND HAS BUILT INAPPROPRIATE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE APP BELPER AND CAN ARTICULATE THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. THIS IS HOW YOUR DATA GETS USED THIS IS WHO OWNS YOUR DATA. THIS IS VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO DO I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY MOST EMPLOYEES WOULDN'T SAY OKAY I TRUST MY EMPLOYER I TRUST THE SITUATION. BUT THIS REALLY IS ASKING THAT EMPLOYEE THE EMPLOYER TO TAKE THAT ADDITIONAL STEP. IN ORDER TO ARTICULATE. WHY THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THE EMPLOYEE SHOULD USE THAN THEY CAN OPT IN AND BE A PART OF IT. I THINK EMPLOYEES THEMSELVES LIKE ALL OF US WANT TO STAY SAFE FROM UP. SO DO I ONE CONTRACT CONTACT TRACING BEING DONE FOR THOSE THAT INTERACT WITH YES. ABSOLUTELY DO I WANT TO HAVE TO USE THE TOOL THAT IMAY NOT KNOW NOTHING ABOUT THAT HAS TREMENDOUS PERSONAL AND PRIVACY IMPLICATIONS ENTER. I'M GONNA BE A LITTLE BIT MORE RELUCTANT ABOUT THAT SIR UNLESS I'VE HAD A CHANCE TO DO MY HOMEWORK SO THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL. IS SETTING UP. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I THINK GOING BACK TO THE BALANCING ACT THAT- CENTER HERTZBERG I'M NOT HERTZBERG ON BURKE HAD TALKED ABOUT. I AM I BELIEVE THAT WE- ARE IN A SITUATION WHERE CERTAIN SAFEGUARDS NEED TO BE PUT INTO PLACE. NGUYEN APPS ARE DOWNLOADED. I FRANKLY BELIEVE THAT UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT SINCE WE'RE NOT IN A POSITION. TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS PANDEMIC. THAT PUBLIC EMERGENCY IN THE SAYS CITY SHOULD DICTATE THAT EVERYBODY PARTICIPATE IN TRACING. AND THAT THE INFORMATION DERIVED BE PROPERLY OVERSEEN BE PROPERLY DISPOSED OF NOT BE ALLOWED IN OTHER CIVIL OR CRIMINAL RELATED CONTACTS WERE DISCLOSED TO THIRD PARTIES. UNRELATED TO THE CONTAINMENT EMERGENCY SITUATION OF THIS PANDEMIC. SO I AM GIVING YOU CAN KIND OF TELL THAT I'M I'M HAVING A CHALLENGE WITH WITH THIS WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE I THINK IT HAS SOME MERITS BUT IN BUT ALSO HAS SOME SOME DRAWBACKS BUT I APPRECIATE YOU TAKING. MY QUESTION SURE EIGHT EIGHT APPRECIATE THAT SENATOR AND REALIZE THAT THIS IS REALLY A SUBSET AND A BIT OF A DIFFERENT APPROACH THAN THAN YOU'VE DONE INSTEAD OF MANDATING SOMETHING IT'S JUST PUTTING IN SOME SAFEGUARDS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT SOMETHING IS. TO MANDATE WHO CAN TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SAFEGUARDS BUILT IN WHO'S GONNA TAKE. RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENSURING THAT THAT APPLICATION. DOES THAT APPLE. DOES WE HAVE THAT ARGUE A LOT IN THIS LED. ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE- STIFLING INNOVATION OR NOT. THIS ISN'T BECAUSE IT'S SAYING THE EMPLOYER CAN CAN GET AN APPLICATION. AND CAN MAKE THAT AVAILABLE DO CONTACT TRACING. BYE THERE'S NOT REALLY THE CONTROLS THAT YOU WOULD LIKE TO SEE WHICH I ACTUALLY DON'T DISAGREE. ABOUT ENSURING THAT THAT INFORMATION GETS USED APPROPRIATELY WE'RE PUTTING SOME OF THAT POWER THE POLICE HANDS TO SAFETY I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THIS. AND SO ALLOWING THEM TO OPT OUT. UNLESS THE CASE IS MADE THAT AND THEY'RE COMFORTABLE IF THEY'RE COMFORTABLE THAT THEIR DATA CAN BE PROTECTED AND THEIR HEALTH IS GOING TO BE PROTECTED BY FACILITATING CONTACT TRACING. I WOULD EXPECT MOST PEOPLE WOULD SAY OKAY I. AND I THINK THAT. AND I THINK TO GET A KEEP IN MIND THAT HERE IN THE SENATE- WE- WE DO A GREAT JOB WITH CONTACT TRACING AND WE DON'T. FORCE ANYBODY TO USE AN APPLICATION THERE ARE OTHER METHODS THAT ARE AVAILABLE. THIS BILL JUST ADDRESSES IF AN EMPLOYER CHOOSES TO USE AN APPLICATION. WHAT THE GUARD RAILS AROUND THE U. R. AROUND THE USE OF THAT APPLICATION. AND YOU AS YOU MENTION OF TALKED ABOUT THIS WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE EVEN GETTING PEOPLE JUST TO WEAR MASKS. LET ALONE HAVE THEM AGREE. TO PROVIDE INFORMATION TO THEIR EMPLOYER AND IF IT'S INFORMATION THAT GOES WITH BEYOND THE CONTACT TRACING OR- VIOLATES THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS AND ALL- I DON'T THINK THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE GOAL THAT WE'VE- CHATTED ABOUT SO. THIS BILL REALLY TRIES TO- PUT LIMITS AND GIVE DIRECTION WHEN AN APPLICATION IS THE APPROACH THAT AN EMPLOYER WANTS TO USE IT DOESN'T. PROHIBITED IT CHAU SHOWED SOME LIMITS AS TO WHAT THE INFORMATION IS THAT CAN BE OBTAINED. GIVES THE EMPLOYED- THAT INFORMATION GIVE SOME KNOWLEDGE AND GIVES HIM THE RIGHT TO SAY YOU KNOW I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH IT- IT BUT IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE ANY OTHER TYPES OF CONTACT TRACING AND AS I THINK THE ASSEMBLY. HAS SUGGESTED IF WHAT THE APPLICATION CALLS FOR. IS SOMETHING WITHIN WHICH PEOPLE CAN FIND THAT COMFORT AND THE PROTECTION OF THEIR PRIVACY ULTIMATELY SO THE INFORMATION IS NOT RETAINED THAT IT ONLY RELATES TO CONTACT TRACING THAT IT IS AS- LIMITING ON. VIOLATING PEOPLE'S PRIVACY AS POSSIBLE YOU'LL FIND EMPLOYEES WILL PARTICIPATE AND TO THE EXTENT THEY DON'T THERE ARE OTHER METHODS OF CONTACT TRACING THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND CAN AND WILL BE USED IN AGAIN I. REFER US ALL TO WHAT WE DO HERE IN THE SENATE. WITHOUT USING AN APPLICATION IS AN APPLICATION HELPFUL. ABSOLUTELY BUT WHAT WE'RE ASKING IN IS THAT THE L. BE LIMITED. IN SCOPE AND IN. IT LENGTH OF TIME THAT IT IS AVAILABLE IN ONLY BE AVAILABLE FOR THE PURPOSE FOR WHICH THE INFORMATION IS INITIALLY- OSTENSIBLY BEING SUCKED AND THAT IS TO ASSIST WITH CONTACT TRACING SO IT- I HOPE THAT I'VE ARTICULATED THIS A BILL THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND IN FACT- I AM. HOPING TO BE A CO AUTHOR OF IT I THINK IT REALLY HAS. STREAMLINED THE PROCESS AND- IT DOES ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED MEANWHILE WE DO HAVE OTHERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK MY APOLOGIES ARE- UP NEXT TO SENATOR MORNING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. SO THE STRENGTH OF THIS BILL IN MY VIEW. IS THE ARTICULATION OF WHAT CAN AND CANNOT BE DONE WITH THE DATA IN ITS IT CAN NLY BE COLLECTED FOR VERY LIMITED USE AND THEN HAS TO BE DESTROYED AFTER IT'S TIME OF USEFULNESS FOR THE TRACING. WE'VE SEEN OTHER AREAS OF THE LAW OF EMPLOYERS COLLECTING HEALTH DATA FROM EMPLOYEES AND THEN- INSURANCE COMPANIES MINING DATA IN CHARGING EMPLOYERS MORE BASED ON CERTAIN HEALTH RISK IN INCENTIVIZING EMPLOYERS TO THEN- SCREEN EMPLOYEES WHO MIGHT HAVE A PRE EXISTING CONDITION SO YOU OPEN UP A PANDORA'S BOX. WHEN EMPLOYERS HAVE ACCESS TO EMPLOYEE HEALTH INFORMATION SO TO ME THE STRENGTH OF THE BILLS TO REALLY PRESCRIBE VERY NARROWLY AND STRICTLY THE PURPOSE OF ANY OF THAT DATA COLLECTION AND WHAT IT CAN AND CAN'T BE USED FOR. ON THE ISSUE OF. OCT IN. ONE OF MY CONCERNS ONE OF OUR CHALLENGES THROUGHOUT THE NATION IS PEOPLE WHO REFUSE TO BELIEVE THERE'S A REAL PUBLIC HEALTH RISK WHO DON'T THINK IT APPLIES TO THEM WHO DON'T WEAR MASKS AND WE'VE SEEN IT ALSO IN. PUBLIC SECTORS OF PRISON GUARDS NOT WEARING MASKS OF POLICE OFFICERS NOT WEARING MASKS- WE HEARD YESTERDAY IN A HEARING. STATE HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES NOT WEARING MASKS AND MOVING BETWEEN INFECTED WARDS IN UNINFECTED WARD'S- SO ONE OF MY CONCERNS IS THE PEOPLE THAT ARE GONNA. EXERCISE THE RIGHT IN THIS BILL TOPPED OUT WILL BE THOSE THAT DON'T CARE ABOUT THEIR FELLOW NEIGHBORS FELLOW WORKERS COWORKERS SAID TETRA. THAT SAID IT IS A BALANCING ACT AND I THINK. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS A PART OF THE INFORMED CONSENT INFORMING AN EMPLOYEE WHO MIGHT BE ASKED TO USE THE APPLICATION THIS EMPLOYER HAVE TO TELL THE EMPLOYEE. WHAT THE PROTECTIONS ARE ON THAT INFORMATION. THAT MIGHT BE COLLECTED. IT'S A QUESTION TO THE- THROUGH THE CHAIR THE CHAIR ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE ACTUALLY FOR THE FREE DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION AND THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY GET FOR YOU I DON'T KNOW THAT THIS BILL PRESCRIBES. WHETHER I JUST DON'T KNOW WHETHER OR NOT THE BILL SAYS EMPLOYER YOU MUST TELL THE EMPLOYEE HAS BEEN DONE I MEAN I WOULD HOPE SO I WOULD EXPECT THAT HAPPENS AND THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE SEE WITH MOST APPLICATIONS IS THIS IS HOW YOUR DATA IS BEING USED CORRECT AND I THINK THAT WOULD HELP. TO GET MORE PARTICIPATION. THIS SUPPORTS THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKER HEALTH OBJECTIVE. IF PART OF THAT INFORMED CONSENT. REQUIRES THE EMPLOYER TO SAY COLLECTED FOR THIS PURPOSE FOR NO OTHER PURPOSE WILL BE DESTROYED BY SUCH AND SUCH A DATE. IT CITRIX. THAT COULD BUILD CONFIDENCE. THAT EXERCISE OF WHETHER AN EMPLOYEE CHOSE. TO OPT IN OR OPT OUT. I WAS ALSO INTERESTED NOT TO SEE PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS. LISTED IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION AND THEN I DID HEAR THE PHONE CALLS WHERE THEY SAID THEY WERE. STILL FORMULATING A POSITION AND I THINK. ALL THE PEOPLE- THE INTEREST GROUPS LARGELY TECHNOLOGY GROUPS FORM PLAYER GROUPS- I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE A PUBLIC HEALTH VOICE. IN HERE AS WELL BECAUSE- IT IS A BALANCING ACT. I AM A STRONG PROTECTOR OF INDIVIDUAL RIGHTS CIVIL LIBERTIES- PRIVACY RIGHTS. BUT WHEN WE HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH EPIDEMIC. IN THE REFUSAL. OF A WORKER. TO PARTICIPATEIN. AN ASPECT OF SCREENING THAT COULD PROVE TO HELP. OTHER CO WORKERS- STAY SAFE AD HEALTHY FATS FOR ME WHERE IT GETS KIND OF TOUGH TO SAY THERE SHOULD NEVER BE AN EXCEPTION. TO THE SHARING OF INFORMATION I IT DOES HELP ME TO UNDERSTAND IT DOESN'T PROHIBIT OTHER TYPES OF TRACING THIS IS SIMPLY RELATED IF THIS PARTICULAR APPLICATION OR- A COMPUTER APPLICATION. WOULD BE. RECOMMENDER BY AN EMPLOYER FOR THEIR WORK FORCE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROTECTING EVERYONE IN THE WORK FORCE- SO THAT'S WHERE I STRUGGLE WITH THIS I WOULDN'T NORMALLY STRUGGLE WITH THE PRIVACY RELATED BILL- I CAN I WILL BE SUPPORTING IT TODAY BUT IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR ME TO HEAR FROM THE AUTHOR- IF AS PART OF THIS IF IT MOVES FORWARD AND MOVES INTO LAW. THAT ANY EMPLOYER SEEKING TO USE SUCH AN APPLICATION WOULD HAVE TO MAKE. AN EMPLOYEE AWARE OF THE PROTECTIONS IF THEY WERE TO OFTEN- SO THAT I'M JUST KIND OF CLOSING WITH THE STATEMENT NOT REALLY A QUESTION THAT IN AND IF YOU WANNA COME IN YEAH IT WELL. FROM MY STANDPOINT I WOULD TEND TO AGREE AND THAT'S PART OF THE EMPLOYER BEING ABLE TO ENSURE TO SIMPLY THAT THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO GO AS I THINK MOST EMPLOYEES IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT ARE GOING TO WANT TO BE PART OF CONTACT TRACING SOME AREN'T. BUT HOPEFULLY THAT'S A REALLY MINIMAL. MOST WILL END PART OF. ENSURING THAT THAT EMPLOYEE DOES OPT INTO THIS PARTICULAR METHOD OF CONTACT TRACING. THAT'S IMPORTANT AND I KNOW THAT THAT. I'M SORRY I CAN'T ANSWER ALL THE QUESTIONS ABOUT THIS BILL THAT THAT MR CHOW COULD BUT ONE THING THAT I DO KNOW HE'S HE'S VERY HAPPY TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE IN WITH YOU. ON AREAS THAT CAN HELP CLARIFY AND SOLIDIFY TO ENSURE THAT THIS GETS DONE MISTRUST. NOT TRY TO PREVENT THESE APPS FROM BEING USED. JUSTIN THAT THAT THEY'RE BEING USED IN AN APPROPRIATE WAY SO THAT'S WHAT FACILITATING. SO THIS BILL IS MEANT TO FACILITATE SIDE I KNOW THAT HE IS OPEN. TO THOSE CONVERSATIONS AND I WAS STAFF. IS WHAT ONE IS AN- ABERRATION I APPRECIATE THAT AND WE'LL LOOK FORWARD TO FOLLOW UP WITH THE AUTHOR AND MAY BE THE COMMITTEES FOLLOW UP WITH THE AUTHOR. IS AGAIN I THINK THE STRENGTH OF THE BILL. IS BEING EXPLICIT ABOUT. WHAT CAN BE DONE WITH THAT TRACING DATA AND WHAT CAN BE DONE. AND HAVING- ANY INFORMED CONSENT SHOULD ALSO PROVIDE THE EMPLOYEE. WITH MAYBE EVEN A WRITTEN ARTICULATION. OF WHAT THAT INFORMATION. CAN BE USED FOR AND NOT AN AND A SPECIFIC. WARRANTY IF YOU WILL IT WON'T BE SHARED IN- SHE THE HUMAN RESOURCES INFORMATION EMPLOYEE FILE ATTACHMENT CENTER. PROTECTING HIPPER RIGHTS AS PART OF. INFORMING A TRACING. PROTOCOL SO. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THAT OPPORTUNITY THANK YOU CENTER MONNING AND THE BILL DOES REQUIRE BUSINESSES TO DISCLOSE THE PUBLIC HEALTH PURPOSE. FOR THE DATA. IN THE CATEGORIES OF DATA TO BE COLLECTED SO THAT IS REQUIRED IN THE BILL AS A DISCLOSURE RELEVANT OF COURSE WE KNOW WHENEVER. WE REQUIRE AN OPT IN. THE ENTITY WERE REQUIRED REQUIRING OR SEE IF I SHOULD SAY SEEKING THE OFTEN TRIES TO GIVE AS MUCH INFORMATION AND ASSURANCE TO THE PERSON IT'S TRYING TO GET TO AGREE- AS POSSIBLE SO. AS AN OPT IN PROGRAM BUT IT WILL REQUIRE THE EMPLOYER TO. GIVE THE ASSURANCES TO THE EMPLOYEE THAT THE EMPLOYEE WOULD THEN FEEL COMFORTABLE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM AND THUS. THAT SHOULD ASSIST IN AGAIN CREATING SOME PARAMETERS LEGITIMATE GUIDELINES TO THE COMPANY BUT AGAIN IT'S NOT THE ONLY AVENUE WE'VE BEEN DOING CONTACT TRACING OF FOR DECADES- IN THIS HEALTH ISSUES WE DO A FOR TUBERCULOSIS FOR EXAMPLE WE'VE BEEN DOING THAT FOR YEARS. WHICH ARE NON APPLICATION BASED SO THERE ARE OTHER OPTIONS- BUT WE DO WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THE PEOPLE ARE- COMFORTABLE WITH THIS AND I WOULD. SUBMIT THAT IF THEY ARE. IN IN SHOULD BE THAT THAT THAT THIS IS SOMETHING POSITIVE THE TRYING TO ASSIST THEM. IN THEIR HEALTH THAT THEY WILL AGREE BUT WE KNOW. YOU KNOW THAT THE FOLKS WHO THINK OF IT AS A HOAX AS I MENTIONED THEY- THAT THEY WON'T EVEN. WEAR MASKS. SO SOME PEOPLE YOU'RE GOING TO GET SOME NOT BUT THIS JUST ONE TWO. AVENUE IF WE DO SEE A GREATER USE OF APPLICATIONS AND I THINK THIS DOES BALANCES PRIVACY ISSUES BUT AGAIN THIS IS A BILL THERE ARE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE STILL BEING DISCUSSED. I THINK THE PURPOSE THE FOCUS IN THE PARAMETERS THAT ARE SET FORTH HERE CERTAINLY GET US- PRETTY CLOSE TO THAT- THE SWEET SPOT THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR SO- WITH THAT WE HAVE A SENATOR TO RUSSIAN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- I JUST WANTED TO. PICK UP ON WHERE SENATOR OBAMA. MONEY WAS FOCUSED ON AND THAT IS YOU KNOW IN THAT WORKPLACE. WE REALLY HAVE TO DO MORE TO PROTECT ALL THOSE WORKERS. WE ARE FINDING EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE NEWSPAPER- WORKPLACES WORKED AS HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE- YOU DON'T GET THE- INFECTED AND- WE HAVE TO DO A MUCH MUCH TIGHTER JOB. AND I AGREE THERE IS OF COURSE A PRIVACY ISSUE BUT THERE IS A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AND THERE'S A PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE FOR PEOPLE IN YOUR WORKPLACE YOU GO TO WORK. YOU EXPECT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO BE PROTECTED YOU EXPECT THAT IT'S GOING TO BE SAFE AND HEALTHY FOR YOU- AND IT'S SO- IT SEEMS TO ME WE HAVE TO HAVE A SYSTEM THAT COVERS ALL THE WORKERS OR ELSE IT'S- USELESS. YOU KNOW AS FAR AS WHAT WE WHAT WE NEED FOR TO PROTECT THOSE WORKERS SO. IF AN EMPLOYEE REFUSES TO SIGN THE HIP A RELEASE AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE SOME SYSTEM LIKE A THE TECHNOLOGY TO MAKE UP FOR IT. THEN THEN YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE TRACED. AT ALL AND- ALL THE WORKERS ASSEMBLY IT'LL BY PATHETICALLY GET FURLOUGHED AND GETS SENT HOME SO I HAVE SOME REAL CONCERNS I'M NOT SURE ABOUT ALL THE ANSWERS I'VE SEEN- IDEAS ABOUT AMENDMENTS TO THIS ABOUT MAKING IT SURE THAT IT'S LIMITED TO THE WORKPLACE SO IT DOESN'T GO BEYOND THAT SO OUR PRIVACY IS PROTECTED OF. SO I THINK THAT THERE ARE DEFINITELY WAYS TO AMEND THIS IN SUCH A WAY THAT WILL GIVE US WHAT WHAT WE ALL ARE LOOKING FOR- SO I'D LIKE TO URGE. THE AUTHORED THROUGH THE PRESENTER TO PLEASE LOOK AT A MORE SERIOUS WAYS OF AMENDING THIS BILL FOR THE COULD HAVE OUR FULL SUPPORT AT LEAST WITH REGARDS TO ME. THANK YOU. SENATOR STERN AND I THINK THAT IS THE LAST INCREASE CENTER STERNECK NO. CENTER GONZALEZ WILL GO NEXT TO CHEDDARS DURING THE FLOOR IS YOURS. OKAY THANK YOU MANAGER- THANKS FOR THIS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT ABATE IT SORT OF DAWNED ON ME THAT THIS COMMITTEE. IS REALLY THE FIRST MEANINGFUL PLACE IN THE LEGISLATURE THAT WE'VE READ STARTED WRESTLING WITH THESE HUGE AND CRUCIAL ISSUES SO- APPRECIATE THE RIGOR WITH WHICH YOU'VE ALLOWED THE DEBATE TO TAKE PLACE MADAM CHAIR AND- YOU KNOW I. THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK THROUGH THIS BILL ABOUT. THERE WILL BE AMENDMENTS OR CONSIDERATION OF AMENDMENTS THIS IS A PROCEDURAL POINT I'M TRYING TO GET A SENSE. IF THIS BILL IS AMENDED- IN SOME SUBSTANTIAL WAY GOING FORWARD ARE WE GONNA HAVE A CHANCE TO SEE THIS AGAIN- OR IS THIS. I DON'T KNOW TIMING WISE ARE THE IS GONNA WORK BUT I'M A LITTLE WORRIED ABOUT TAKING A VOTE TODAY AND THEN. YOU KNOW WE COULD LOOK ENTIRELY DIFFERENT LATER ON WE DON'T GET GET A SECOND BITE AT THE APPLE. YEAH I DON'T I DON'T THINK THE BILLS CAN LOOK ENTIRELY DIFFERENT I THINK THAT THE AUTHOR AND- THIS COMMITTEE ARE PAYING VERY CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN ARTICULATED. I THINK THAT THE BILL HAS IT HAS MOVED HAS BEEN TIGHTENED CONSIDERABLY- THE BILL'S NEXT JOURNEY IS TO APPROPRIATIONS WERE OF COURSE YOU KNOW. AMENDMENTS CAN AND ARE LIKELY TO BE TAKEN THEN WE ARE IN A RATHER CONSTRICTED TIME FRAME- BUT- I THINK AT THIS POINT WITH THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE ON THIS BILL. THE HARD WORK BY THE- BY THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF OF THIS COMMITTEE I THINK WE HAVE MOVED ALONG- TO A POINT WHERE- I WON'T SAY IT PROTOCOL TO TWEAK. BUT I THINK WE'RE CLOSE TO THE POINT WHERE WE JUST NEED TO- PERHAPS- CLARIFY A LITTLE BIT MORE- SIGNIFICANTLY JUST WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T DO BUT IN TERMS OF RE WRITING THE BILL. AND GOING IN A DIFFERENT DIRECTION- THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPENOKAY I BET THAT'S YOUR HELPFUL I'M CAN I JUST ASK- IT JUST A SUBSTANTIVE QUESTION OF THE AUTHOR HERE. WELL WITHOUT OBJECTION TO THE PRESENTING ASSEMBLY MEMBERS JIM REMEMBER STONE SURE YES. PLEASE RATE. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. SO THE- I'M I'M TRYING TO SQUARE THIS I KNOW YOU'RE NOT THE AUTHOR OF SIX SIXTY BUT THE DEFINITION WE JUST WENT THROUGH LOOKING AT CONTACT TRACING WRITTEN LARGE AND NOT BEING ABLE TO USE THAT INFORMATION FOR ANY OTHER PURPOSES OTHER THAN CONTACT TRACING. THAT SEEM TO BE COMPREHENSIVE- YOUR THE BILL HERE AS YOU RIGHTLY POINT OUT DEALS WITH JUST THE TECHNOLOGY ASSISTED CONTACT TRACING RIGHT THAT SUBSET THAT ACT SET. I I'M I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHY WE NEED TO START A SECOND LAYER OF PROTECTION IF WE'RE ALREADY SAYING YOU CAN ONLY USE THAT CONTACT TRACING ANY KIND OF CONTACT TRACING INFO FOR CONTACT TRACING PURPOSES ONLY WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE A SECOND SET OF RESTRICTIONS IN HERE. JUST FOR A TECHNOLOGY SPECIFIC KIND. SURE CENTER AND I THINK THE REASON IS BECAUSE OF THE NATURE OF APPLICATIONS AND HOW THOSE GET USED I THINK THE EXPECTATION IS THAT THAT INFORMATION THAT IS BEING USED DURING KIND CONTACT TRACING AND MOST OF THE BILLS DEALING WITH THAT ARE DEALING IN THE LARGER SENSE OF CONTACT FACING ANY OF THE TOOLS THAT MIGHT GET USED FOR CONTACT TRACING. THIS IS INCOMPATIBLE WITH THAT BUT IT IS CLARIFYING. THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO USE AN APPLICATION AND REMEMBER THE APPLICATION BY ITS NATURE. IS COLLECTING MORE INFORMATION. THAN SOMEONE NECESSARILY WOULD THROUGH USING OTHER TOOLS BECAUSE IF IT IS DOING IF IT IS TRACKING THE MOVEMENTS OF AN INDIVIDUAL FOR EXAMPLE. THEN THAT INFORMATION IS BEING COLLECTED AND STORED SOMEWHERE AND YES WHICH ONLY SUPPOSED TO BE BEING USED FOR CONTACT TRACING. BUT BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T SPECIFIED WHO OWNS THAT WHERE DATA IS COMING FROM. AND IT MIGHT BE THE COMPANY WITH THE RESPONSIBILITY OR AN ORGANIZATION WITH RESPONSIBILITY OF DOING THE CONTACT TRACING AND YET THE DATA THAT COMES OUT OF THE APPLICATION ITSELF. MAY RESIDE IN B. OWN SOMEPLACE OUT. WE'RE JUST TRYING TO DO. A LITTLE BIT OF BELT AND SUSPENDERS HERE. ENSURING THAT ANY INFORMATION COLLECTED THROUGH THE APPLICATION BECAUSE THAT'S ALL WE'RE LOOKING AT IS THE APPLICATION ITSELF. IS BEING MANAGED IN SUCH A WAY AS WE WOULD EXPECT. SO I DON'T AS LONG AS THOSE DEFINITIONS AND THE PROTECTIONS ARE SIMILAR THERE'S REALLY NO HARM HERE BUT THERE ARE OTHER. WHO HAVE ACCESS TO THIS INFORMATION POTENTIALLY DEPENDING ON HOW THE APP GETS WRITTEN. AND WHOSE IT IS AND WHERE IT RESIDES IN AND HOW IT FUNCTIONS. THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT ALL OF THOSE PARTIES ARE BROUGHT IT INTO SENATOR MUNNINGS POINTS. THAT IT IS ART OF THE SELLING POINT FOR ANY ORGANIZATION ASKING SOMEONE TO YOU IS AN APPLICATION LIKE THIS. THE PART THAT SELLING POINT TO BE CLEAR ABOUT WHAT THE LIMITATIONS ARE ON THAT DATA. BECAUSE YOU'RE SITTING ONE ON ONE AND COLLECTING CONTACT TRACING INFORMATION. YOU CAN SAY I THIS IS ONLY GOING TO BE USE A LAWS GOING TO SAY THIS CAN ONLY BE USED IN THE SENSE. BUT AS WE USE APPLICATIONS WE'LL DO THAT HE JUST CLICK ON THE DOWNLOAD I WANT TO USE THE APPLICATION. DO YOU AGREE TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS THAT'S JUST A CLICK THROUGH. HAVE YOU READ AND READ. I GUESS I'M I'M I'M CURIOUS THOUGH IF THE IF THE APP DOESN'T. REQUIRE OR IF WE BAR THE APP FROM SAY DOING GEOLOCATION. AT ALL OFF THE WORKSITE. THE YOU DO THAT JUST TRICKS INSTANCE IN THE- IN THE SNIFFING HEALTH CONTEXT HERE BUT- THEN THERE'S NO THERE'S NO DATA TO WORRY ABOUT THAT IN THAT IN THAT CASE I DON'T KNOW I MEAN IT DEPENDS ON WHAT ELSE IS BEING COLLECTED BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T RESTRICTED THE INFORMATION. BEING COLLECTED WORDS SAYING THE INFORMATION YOU'RE GETTING HAS TO BE USED FOR CONTACT TRACING. AND YOU'RE NOT JUST SAYING THAT YOU'RE ALSO SAYING WHETHER OR NOT YOU CAN USE THE TOOL AT ALL RIGHT I MEAN YOU ARE SAYING. THAT YOU'RE NOT JUST REFINING. THE NATURE OF THE TOOL YOU'RE ALSO SAYING AND YOU HAVE TO OPT INTO THIS TOOL. AND YOU HAVE THE RIGHT AT ANY TIME TO OPT OUT OF THAT TOOL AND I GUESS I DON'T SEE THIS THE SAME WAY AS LIKE. A CONSUMER GOING ON THE INTERNET NOT WANTING TO HAVE ADS SERVED ON THEM WERE YOU KNOW. THAT KIND OF CONSUMER PRIVACY CONTEXT YOU KNOW MINE RIGHT TO. NOT WEAR A MASK OR NOT BE CONTACT REYES AND THEN GO IN FACT ALL MY EMPLOYEES INHIBITS THE RIGHTS OF OTHERS SO I. I DON'T SEE THIS IS THE SAME KIND OF. FRAMEWORK THAT THAT LIKE THE CZ WE HAD THERE'S A LOT OF. TALK ABOUT THIS THE CPA IN THE- AND THE ANALYSIS AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE SORT OF USING THAT AS THE BASELINE FRAMEWORK THIS IS NOT A CONSUMER. FRAMEWORK AT ALL THIS IS ABOUT. THE FOR MY FREEDOM TO GO TO WORK AND FEEL SAFE- IS CONTINGENT UPON OTHER PEOPLE PLAYING BY THE SAME RULES AS ME AND I DON'T WANT THOSE WHO WANT TO BE REBELS. AND GO GET COVETING COME INTO WORK. BECAUSE THEY EXERCISE THEIR RIGHT TO PRIVACY TO THAN EVER HAMMER OVER ALL THE REST OF US WHO WANT TO. LIVE OUR LIVES SAFELY SO THAT THAT'S MY CONCERN IS NOT JUST THE MECHANICS OF THE TOOL. IT'S THE RESTRICTION OF USING THE TOOL AT ALL IN THE FIRST PLACE BUT BUT IF WE'RE HAVING TROUBLE WITH PEOPLE. TAKING ON MASKS WE'RE GONNA HAVE AN EVEN HARDER TIME GETTING PEOPLE TO. TAKE ON CONTACT TRACING SO. ACT RIGHT YEAH SURE OF IT BUT SHOULD I SUBMIT THE RESUME HIS OUT THOSE WHO DELIVERS A COUPLE DIFFERENT CATEGORIES HERE. THERE ARE THOSE WHO ARE GOING TO WANT HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH THIS STUFF AND THEY TRULY ARE PUTTING ALL OF US AT RISK AND- INCLUDING PORTLAND POLICE. THEIR CO WORKERS AND OTHERS. THE ARE THEY LIKE TO BE THIS OUT YET THEN THAT'S NOT REALLY THE TARGET AUDIENCE HERE. THERE THERE ARE ANY EMPLOYER ANY ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE USING MULTIPLE MEASURES TO DO THE CONTACTORS. THIS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH ANYTHING OTHER THAN A TECHNOLOGY ASSISTEDCONTACT TRACING AND HALF A CENTURY. AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT THAT APP HAS BEEN APPROPRIATELY VETTED AND APPROVED WE THOUGHT ABOUT INAPPROPRIATELY USING IN IN THE IDEAL CONTEXT YES THAT'S PROBABLY FINE. AND IF SOMEONE IS SUPPOSED TO CONTACT TRACING WEARING A MASK AND ALL THAT. WELL UNLESS WHICH IS BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS UNLESS WE SAY THAT WE SHALL TO. THAT'S A POSSIBILITY IF NOT REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. THEN THOSE PEOPLE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE A THREAT TO THOSE AROUND THEM THAT'S FINE IN THIS CASE. IT'S NOT INVALIDATING THE TOOL BECAUSE THE ORGANIZATION CAN STILL USE THE TOOL. BUT AN INDIVIDUAL HAS THE ABILITY HERE TO SAY WAIT A MINUTE. THIS GOES BEYOND WHAT I WOULD EXPECT I'M HAPPY TO DO CONTACT. YOU CAN ASK ME WHATEVER YOU WANT I WANT TO SEE WHAT THAT INFORMATION IS WORK OUT. BUT THE FACT THAT THAT INFORMATION IS NOW BEING UPLOADED AND DISTRIBUTED DISSEMINATED GOD KNOWS WHERE. THEN I'M NOT COMFORTABLE WITH THAT. I WANT TO BE ABLE TO OPT OUT THAT'S REALLY ALL THAT THIS BILL DOES IS PROVIDE THAT OPPORTUNITY SO IT'S NOT INVALIDATING THE USEFULNESS OF THE TOOL BUT IT IS GIVING AN INDIVIDUAL THE ABILITY TO SAY. YOU HAVEN'T MADE THE CASE FOR ME DAY THIS IS PROTECTIVE ENOUGH. FOR ME TO BE COMFORTABLE. USING THAT APPLICATION NOT ONLY LAST LONGER WHICH IS A SUBSET OF THAT QUESTIONS THE JUST SAY AND THANK YOU FOR THE INTELLIGENCE OF THIS CONVERSATION- IF THEY DON'T USE THAT TOOL AND THEY DON'T SIGNED HIPPA RELEASE. YOU CAN'T CONTACT RACE AT ALL I MEAN. PLEASE STOP WHAT DO WE DO KNOW THE SCOPE OF WHAT WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT HERE BECAUSE ALL FOCUSED ON. WE'RE NOT DEALING WITH THE LARGER PROBLEM OF PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GOING TO BE COOPER THAT ALL. ENDED THAT'S THAT'S A BIGGER QUESTION HERE. ALL WE'RE SAYING IS. IF ONE OF THOSE TOOLS. SORRY ONE OF THOSE TOOLS. IS AN APPLICATION. THAT'S BEING USED AND GIVEN THE IMPLICATIONS OF WHAT APPLICATIONS CAN COLLECT. WITHOUT EVEN. ANY CONTROLS BECAUSE THAT'S THE NATURE OF THE APPLICATION. THEN THEY CAN THE EMPLOYEE NEEDS TO BE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH THAT TO SAY YEAH YEAH OKAY THAT IS A FINE MATHIS. THAT INDIVIDUAL WHO'S NOT GONNA SIGNED HIPPA RELEASE NOT GONNA DO ANYTHING ELSE WELL GOOD LUCK I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO BUT THAT THAT THAT'S NOT THIS BILL. THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT LOOKING AT ONE SPECIFIC TOOL ENSURING THAT IT IS USED. APPROPRIATELY THAT'S ALL IT IS HI THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT THE ROBUST DISCUSSION- SENATOR GONZALEZ AND THEN WILL ASK YOU TO CLOSE CENTERS ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE. S. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND- THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR ANSWERING A LOT OF QUESTIONS AND FOR THE INSIGHTFUL DISCUSSION AS WELL- JUST HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS I DIDN'T SEE IT EXPLICITLY HERE- BUT- THE- AT MISUSED WITHIN THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT HAS BEEN DISCUSSED BUT- WHAT ABOUT. OUTSIDE OF THE- BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS A CYBER SECURITY AND ANY BREACHES- AND ANY BREACH SAFEGUARDS THAT COULD BE. INCLUDED AS WELL HAVE THERE BEEN. WELL I DID IT AGAIN BECAUSE THIS THIS BILL IS DEALING WITH THE APPLICATION ITSELF. ANY OF THOSE BREACHES OR VIOLATIONS BASED ON THE USE OF THAT APPLICATION IS REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS TALKING. JUST ON THE APPLICATION YEAH NOTHING OUT THERE YET NOTHING NOTHING OUTSIDE THE APPLICATION. OKAY AND THEN- YEAH AND THEN I ALSO SEE THERE AREN'T ANY REQUIREMENTS FOR UPDATES AS PUBLIC HEALTH RESEARCH INVOLVES. SO IF THERE'S MORE A NEED FOR MORE THAN JUST SOMETHING ELSE TYPING THINK ABOUT AS MORE DATA AS WE MAY NEED MORE DATA OR MORE- INFORMATION- TO INCLUDE AS- THIS CRISIS EVOLVES AND AS WE'RE LEARNING MORE ABOUT THIS CRISIS I THINK WOULD BE- ANOTHER THING TO THINK ABOUT THE ONLY. REASON I BRING THESE TWO UP IS THAT THERE HAVE BEEN- DISCUSSIONS OF COURSE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL- THROUGH THE AT. THE NOTIFICATION- ACT THERE BUT DO INCLUDE INCLUDE THOSE TWO- ITEMS YES I JUST WANTED TO. ASK ABOUT THAT YEAH IF YOU GET THIS IS NOT ABOUT WHAT DATA IS BEING COLLECTED SHOULD THAT IT IS BEING PROTECTED AND THAT THE THIRTY. MINIMUM SO IF THERE IS ADDITIONAL INFORMATION THAT THAT IS REQUESTED. OR NEEDED pTO THE APP SAYS IT WOULD BE ADDED TO THE INTERVIEW QUESTIONS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE. USING A MORE FACE TO FACE TYPE OF. CONTRACTORS RIGHT OKAY. WELL THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANKS MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT TACTIC CONTRACTS ARE REQUIRED- BY THE BILL TO HAVE DATA BREACH REQUIREMENTS. SO THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED. WELL WITH THAT INTERVIEW REAL DISK. PAVIA VERY IMPORTANT ISSUE- CENTER Y. CASKEY HOW MOVE THE BILL THE- BILL- NO NO CANCER OFF- THANK YOU FOR THE DISCUSSION AND- I JUST LIKE TO SAY IT'S IMPORTANT WITH THESE APPLICATIONS. THAT WE RECOGNIZE WORK IN A CRISIS AND WE TRY TO USE SOME AFFECTED FULLY. AND NOT AS AN EXCUSE TO DO MORE TO GAIN PEOPLE'S INFORMATION TO VIOLATE PRIVACY- THEN IT IS ABSOLUTE. SURRENDER THE STATE. BELIEVE THIS BILL ABSOLUTELY DOES THAT IT SETS GUIDELINES- FOR THE APPLICATION. IT ALLOWS THE EMPLOYEE TO GET INFORMATION SO THEY KNOW EXACTLY WHAT IS AND IS NOT BEING COLLECTED IT IS ONE OF A TOOL MANY TOOLS AGAIN HERE IN THE SENATE CAN YOU IMAGINE IF. WE HAD TO SIGN ON TO THESE APPLICATIONS THAT WERE FOLLOWING US EVERYWHERE WE WENT- WE MIGHT. WE MIGHT REJECT THAT NOTION- SOLUTION IT DOES HAVE TO HAVE SOME RESTRICTIONS I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE- THERE IS A MOTION. THE MOTION IS I BELIEVE TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. AND WITH THAT- OF THE FOR SERVICE FOR YOUR CLIENTS THANK YOU MISTER TECH GAVE ME ABOUT THREE PAGES OF CLOSING STATEMENTS. BUT WITH THAT ARTICULATE STATEMENT OF YOUR OWN MADAM CHAIR. I WILL LET THAT STAND AS MY CLOTHES I JUST LAST WEEK I KEPT.

TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO ANOTHER EASY ONE AND- WILL ALLOW YOU TO- TO OPEN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR WORK ON THIS IN YOUR STAFF'S WORK ON THIS AS WE'VE RIED. TO REFINE THIS BILL IN INDIA WITH A LOT OF THE ISSUES IS AS WE KNOW MANUFACTURED HOMES IN OUR DISTRICTS ARE SOME OF THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SOURCES OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING. BUT WHAT OFTEN HAPPENS IS PARKS ARE PURCHASED AND- INVENTORY FOR AWHILE UNTIL THERE THEN TURNED INTO SOMETHING THAT WAS MORE LUCRATIVE. FOR THAT THE PARK OWNER AND TO BE DEVELOPED AND WHAT THE DATA SHOWS VERY CLEARLY IS THOSE CONVERSIONS. READ THE RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN HOUSING. AND TO TAKE THAT AFFORDABLE HOUSING GENERALLY OFF THE MARKET SO THAT HAS A DETRIMENTAL EFFECT ON. OUR ABILITY ACROSS THE STATE TO MANAGE AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE'VE WORKED THESE THIS ISSUE FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS NOW IN TRYING TO. ENSURE THAT THE- RESIDENTS THE OWNERS OF THE MANUFACTURED HOMES GET APPROPRIATE NOTICE WHICH IS WHAT THIS BILL IS ABOUT. AND ASKING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO. ADOPT SOME FINDINGS. ON THE IMPACT TO AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS THAT WE'VE TAKEN SOME AMENDMENTS RECENTLY TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT THOSE FINDINGS BUT SAID AFFECT OF THE WITH THE ACTUAL LOCAL JURISDICTION EFFECTIVELY PRECLUDED THE ABILITY CONVERT THE PARTIES THAT'S NOT WHAT WE'RE AFTER THIS NOT WITH THE INTENT WAS. WE KNOW THOSE CONVERSIONS ARE GOING TO GO FORWARD WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE- OWNER OF THE MANUFACTURED HOME. GETS FAIR MARKET VALUE GETS APPROPRIATE NOTICE AND EIGHT SO THAT THAT THEY CAN THEN BE PLACED INTO. HOUSING IN THEIR COMMUNITY INSTEAD OF LOSING THEIR CONNECTION WITH THE COMMUNITY TODAY THEY HAVE BEEN LIKE FOR EXAMPLE IN MY DISTRICT SOME THESE PARKS PEOPLE BUT IN THESE PARTS FOR YEARS AND YEARS AND YEARS. AT WHEN THE MARKET CONVERTED THEY THEN CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BE IN THAT AREA. THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO ADDRESS. AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES THOUGHTFUL WORK WITH US ON AMENDING THIS BILL AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS AS MANY OF THE ISSUES WE CAN. WE HAVE ALSO I WILL NOTE THAT SENATOR AMBER CAME TO US BECAUSE HIS BILL SENATE BILL NINE NINETY NINE WHICH CLOSED A LOOPHOLE OF MULTI YOUR MOBILE HOME LEADERS NOT HAVING TO BUY BY LOCAL RENT CONTROL. MEASURES THAT BILL WAS STRUGGLING IT IS A PART OF A PACKAGE THAT'S WHAT IS A PART OF THIS BILL BECAUSE THAT IS GOOD POLICY TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO. KEEP PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES IN THESE MANUFACTURED HOMES TO THE BEST EXTENT POSSIBLE AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR ABOUT. THE SO WE ARE CLEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF STONE- YOU WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS AS PROPOSED ON PAGE SIXTEEN YEAH SEVEN OF THE ANALYSIS. AND THAT IS ATTACHED TO THE ANALYSIS AS WELL ALL RIGHT SO AND AT THIS POINT TIME WE'RE GOING TO MOVE ON TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT YOU HAVE A BROUGH STANTON GENERAL COUNSEL FOR CALIFORNIA'S.

DISTLLATE DRESSES THE ISSUE OCCURRING WITH THE LAND UNDERNEATH THE VOCAL HALL. IT'S CONVERTED TO ANOTHER USE OR EVEN PERHAPS TO NO USE AT ALL. BY THE MOBILE HOME PARK OWNER IT IS A SITUATION. OCCURRING WITH INCREASING FREQUENCY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS LANDOWNERS RECEIVE HIGHER AND BETTER USES FOR THE PROPERTY. DIFFICULTLY NOTHING IN THIS BILL PREVENTS THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FROM ENACTING ADDITIONAL PROTECTIVE MEASURES. BILLS DOES NOT DICTATE LOCAL GOVERNMENT OUTCOMES RELATED TO A PARK OR CLOSER THAT POWER WILL BE RETAINED BY THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT I DO THIS BILL. IT PORT PLEADED DOES HOWEVER ACT RESIDENTS CONCLUDING EQUITY AT MARKET VALUE WITH THEIR HOMES WHICH OFFICE YOU ARE MOST EXTENSION ONE THAT'S DUE TO LANDOWNER INVESTMENT DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE COMPLETELY OUTSIDE OF THEIR CONTROL. IT DOES THAT BY MINIMUM. GOVERNMENT STANDARDS. THE MARKET VALUE PER. WHICH IS REALLY CRITICAL TO THIS ALREADY EXIST OR IN OVER FIFTY LOCAL CITY AND COUNTY ORDINANCES AND HAS PROVEN AS RESULT TO BE. A REASONABLE. A REASONABLE PROVISION OF THOSE APPS JURISDICTIONS. THE BILL ALSO CLOSES A LOOPHOLE WHICH WOULD PREVENT BOTH BLOCKED RESIDENTS FROM RECEIVING THE BENEFITS OF WHAT THEIR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HATCHET TO LOG REGARDING THE ISSUE OF AFFORDABILITY. IT RESTORE LOCAL CONTROL ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS STAND WITH ALL THEIR IT CAN'T PROTECTIONS FOR THE VULNERABLE. RESIDENTS RESIDING JURISDICTION. YEAH IT ALSO- WITH RESPECT TO THE SENATE DROPPERS PORSCHE BUILT IS NOT PREVENTED. PARTIES FROM ENTERING INTO USUALLY AGREED UPON RENTAL AGREEMENTS INCLUDING ALL TAKE YOUR LEASE AGREEMENTS ORDERS THE BILL ANYWAY INTERFERE WITH ANY EXISTING ALL ALL. GRANT AGREEMENT OR LEASE.

OF AB TWENTY SEVEN EQ YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON THE TELEPHONE KEYPAD. I HAVE NO ONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL NOW GO TO THE OPPOSITION. OF LET'S SEE DO WE HAVE ANYONE IDENTIFIED AS WITNESSES TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. I BELIEVE WE HAVE A JASON I KURD OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARKS A PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE AND ANDREW GOVERNOR OF THE WESTERN MANUFACTURED HOUSING COMMUNITIES ASSOCIATION AND- I REALLY BOTH ARE HERE IN PERSON- TO- TESTIFIED PLEASE. FEEL FREE TO GO AHEAD IDENTIFY YOURSELF AND COLLECTIVELY OR FOUR MINUTES. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- AFTER GOVERNOR ABOUT THE WMA RESPECTFULLY MUST OPPOSE TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO. UP UNTIL LAST WEDNESDAY TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO WITH A BILL THAT DEALT WITH MOBILE HOME PARK CLOSURES- BUT ON WEDNESDAY IT WAS AMENDED TO INCLUDE SENATOR BURKE SB NINE NINE NINE DIED IN THE ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE. BOTH BILLS THE PARK ASPECT INTERESTING BECAUSE APART CLOSER ASPECTS CONTENTION IS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ARE INCAPABLE OF SETTING THE STANDARDS THEY NEED IN ORDER TO. ADJUDICATE APART CLOSURE. AND S. B. NINE AT NINE I'M BURKE ON THE LEAST BILL SAYS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS KNOW EXACTLY WHAT TO DO IN TERMS OF RENT CONTROL AND THEREFORE DON'T WANT THE STATE TO VOTE ON THEIR BUSINESS OF TWO. CONTRADICTORY LOCAL GOVERNMENT STATE POLICIES IN THE SAME BUILDING OBVIOUSLY WE SEE THEM IN SEPARATE BILLS THAT'S WHERE YOU SEE A SOMETHING LIKE THAT. IN TURN OF. CLOSURES I THINK WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE EXAMPLE ACTUALLY FOR BOTH BILLS. THERE'S NEVER BEEN AN EXAMPLE THAT SHOWS A PARK CLOSURES ACTUALLY. HARM TO RESIDENTS. IN MR STONE'S TESTIMONY THERE'S NO EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT OF RESIDENT HOUSING RECEIVE ADEQUATE COMPENSATION. IN THE TWO YEARS SINCE THIS BILL HAS BEEN ALIVE NO EXAMPLES OF COME FOR. AND SO WE BELIEVE THE BILL ACTUALLY ISN'T NEEDED BECAUSE CURRENT LAW ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENACT AND ENFORCE CLOSE ORDINANCES FOR WHICH THEY DO. AND IF YOU BELIEVE IN THE PROMISE OF THE NINE NINE NINE BUT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AMERICAN SOLDIERS JURISDICTIONS KNOW BEST HOW TO DO THIS. AND WHAT DO YOU HAVE THAT SAME STATE THAT THE SAME JURISDICTIONS WILL BE ABLE TO DO A PARK CLOSURE ORDINANCE. WE DON'T KNOW WHY THIS BILL ONLY APPLIES TO MOBILE HOMES WHY WOULD YOU SIMPLY APPLY TO ONE TYPE OF PROPERTY WHEN A PART. WENT OUT WALMART'S ONE NOT LIQUOR STORES IF IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT WE GET LOW INCOME AND AFFORDABLE HOUSING. IMPORTANTLY WHY SHOULD LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE THEIR HANDS TIED AT THE MOMENT IN TIME WHEN THEY GO TO CLOSE THE PARK. VERSUS BEING ABLE TO FILL THEIR HOUSING ELEMENT WHICH LASTS FIVE YEARS. AT THE END OF FIVE YEARS IF THEY'RE HOUSING ELEMENT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT LOW INCOME AND MODERATE INCOME HOUSING. WOULD BE. YOU CAN. I'M FINE WORKING WITH ONE OF OUR ATTORNEYS WHO IS THE PERSON THAT DOES PARK CLOSURES AND HER SIXTEEN YEARS OF DOING THIS SHE HAS NEVER WORKED ON A PARK CLOSURE THAT HAS RESULTED IN A COMMERCIAL CHANGE EVERY SINGLE PART BECAUSE SHE'S WORKED ON HAVE BEEN FOR HOUSING AND SO IN THAT REGARD WE BELIEVE IT'S INCORRECT THAT EVERY PART CLOSURE THAT OCCURS AS BEEN FOR HOUSING. AND FINALLY PART CLOSURES TAKE FOUR TO FIVE YEARS I'M KNOW OF ONE PART CLOSER ON IN THE ENTIRE STATE RIGHT NOW NOT TO MEET. TWO SEVENTY. THAT MOVE TO NINE NINE NINE BECAUSE WE'RE LIMITED THE REASON I KNOW NINE ONE KILLED IN THE US COME WAS BECAUSE WE SHOULD THAT INTO LIKES STERN AND IT'S UNDER AND THUNDER WERE IS THIS BILL WILL BE TO RENT INCREASES AND LOS ANGELES COUNTY RESIDENTS GET CPI PLUS 1% FOR FIVE TEN FIFTEEN AND TWENTY YEARS UNDER THE L. A. COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS PROMISE WE'RE SIMPLY ON JANUARY FIRST OF NEXT YEAR GOING TO WRITE ONE YEAR LEASES AT 3% AND PEOPLE CAN GET TWENTY YEARS IT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. IT'S BAD PUBLIC POLICY IT'S BAD POLITICS AND FOR THIS WE ASK FOR YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU YOUR NEXT WITNESS HAS A MINUTE. AND TEN SECONDS. PERFECT THANK YOU MATT CHAIR AND MEMBERS JASON I COULD WITHOUT A- GILBERT ROSSMAN SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MOBILE HOME PARK OWNERS ALLIANCE. I WILL BELIEVER THE POINTS MISTER GARNER JUST MADE BUT JUST TO SAY ON THE CONVERSION ISSUE. ARE MAJOR CONCERNS REMAIN THE SAME EVEN WITH THE AMENDMENTS THEY'RE GOING TO BE SOME INSTANCES IN WHICH A LOCAL GOVERNMENT WILL EFFECTIVELY. NOT HAVE A CHOICE TO ALLOW PARK TO CLOSE. THE BILL REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT WAS PROPOSING TO CLOSE APART PLAY THE IN PLACE MARKET VALUE OF EVERY HOME IN THE PARK IF AND IF A RESIDENT CAN'T FIND A REPLACEMENT HOUSING IN ANOTHER PART. THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE CASE. NOT ALL PARKS ARE CREATED EQUAL SOME PARTS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO OUR PARK OWNERS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PAY THAT IT'LL BE COST PROHIBITIVE. AND IN THAT INSTANCE AS MR GOVERNOR SAYS EXISTING LAW ALLOWS LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO DO THIS TODAY. TO REQUIRED TODAY AND THEY OFTEN DO- BUT THEY WILL HAVE NO OPTION EVEN IF THEY BELIEVE THE EXISTING PARK IS UNSAFE FOR THE COMMUNITY AND LASTLY ON THE LONG TERM LEASE PROVISIONS ON TO SAY THAT. IT'S IMPORTANT TO REMEMBER THAT THERE CONSUMER PROTECTIONS THAT ARE INCLUDED IN THOSE LEASES. YOU HAVE A RIGHT. TO REJECT THE LEASE AFTER THIRTY DAYS YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO AVOID THE LOOK AT LEAST AFTER THREE DAYS WE ARE ALSO REMOVING THE INCENTIVE FOR A PARK HONOR TO OFFER THAT AS WELL. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS WE URGE A NO VOTE ON THE THINK TODAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. RIGHT ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE CHAMBER WHO WISH TO GIVE THEIR NAME AND AFFILIATION ONLY IN OPPOSITION. SIGNAL OTHER. IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. THERE'S NO ONE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WILL GO TO THE PHONES SHOULD MATTER MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PLEASE PROMPT INDIVIDUALS. WHO ARE WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO. WE CAN BEGIN AND AFTER YOU TO PROMPT THEM WOULD YOU INDICATE HOW MANY THERE ARE IN THE QUEUE. GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SEVEN ET QUEUE YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR TELEPHONE KEYPAD. IF YOU ARE USING A SPEAKER PHONE MAY NEED TO PICK UP THE HANDSET BEFORE PRESSING THE NUMBERS AGAIN PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. IF YOU ARE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO. I HAVE ONE PERSON IN THE QUEUE WILL GO TO LINE NUMBER ONE HUNDRED AND TWENTY LINE ONE TWO ZERO YOU MAY GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON MA'AM CARE NUMBERS THIS IS ROSS BARKLEY ON BEHALF TO SECURE INVESTMENT COMPANY WE'D LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH THE SPEAKER FROM BELLEVUE AND A IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE QUEUE IN OPPOSITION- MADAM MODERATOR IF YOU WOULD PROMPT THEM AND IF NOT PLEASE ADVICE. AS A REMINDER IF YOU ARE TESTIFYING IN OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY TWO PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AGAIN FOR OPPOSITION. OF AB TWENTY SEVEN ET QUEUE YOU MAY PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. THE. I HAVE NO ONE IN THE QUEUE PLEASE CONTINUE THANK YOU LOOKS SO THEN BRING IT BACK TO ANY DISCUSSION ON THE FLOOR WE'LL START WITH SENATOR BURKE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO NUMBER STONE THANK YOU FOR INCLUDING IN YOUR BILL PROTECTIONS FOR MOBILE HOME RESIDENTS. SO THAT THEY MAY BE A FOR THE SAME KINDS OF PROTECTION THAT WOULD BE AFFORDED OTHERS YES BUT LOCAL. ORDINANCES PASSED PROVIDING FOR RENT CONTROL IS AN IMPORTANT MEASURE AND I APPRECIATE YOUR GOOD JUDGMENT INCLUDING THESE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS. THANK YOU SO. I'M SORRY WAS AT A STATEMENT OR A QUESTION. BOB. WELL I SUPPOSE IT WAS A STATEMENT BUT THE- THE QUESTION COULD BE WASN'T SMART OF YOU TO INCLUDE THOSE PROVISIONS THANK YOU SO MANY MEMBERS. YEAH IT IT IS BUT IT WAS NOT MY BRILLIANCE I HAD TO RELY ON GOOD COUNSEL FROM. THE SENATOR FROM SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA IN ORDER TO KNOW TO BRING THIS INTO THIS BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE A SENATOR WHITE CASKEY. MANAGER OF QUESTION A VALUATION THE OPPOSITION INDICATED THAT THE BEST PRACTICE SIR. IS THAT WHEN THEY VALUE THESE UNITS THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE THE IN PLACE MARKET OR VALUES COULD BE USED THIS BILL REQUIRES SAID CAN I HAVE A- CLARIFICATION FROM THE AUTHOR ON. THROUGH THE CHAIR CERTAIN JIM. YES WE ARE REQUIRING THAT THE IN PLACE MORE COULD VALUE D. WHAT IS RECEIVED IF THEY CANNOT BE PLACED IN ANOTHER MOBILE HOME PARK OF THE LEAST SIMILAR QUALITY IN THE SAME CITY OR TOWN OR WHATEVER WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT MANUFACTURE HOMEOWNERS GET APPROPRIATE VALUE FOR THEIR- FOR THEIR HOME. MADAM CHAIR IF I CAN FOLLOW UP FRONT PAGE SEPT SIXTEEN OF OUR THIRTY TWO PAID STAFF ANALYSIS ON THIS BILL HE POINTS OUT THAT THEIR EXPLOSIVELY REMOVING LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE HOMEOWNER TO OBTAIN A SECOND. APPRAISAL UNTIL OF THE DECISION MAKING- AGENCY TO HAVE TO REVIEW THIS WHEN I GO TO PAGE THIRTY OF OUR THIRTY TWO PAGE STAFF ANALYSIS- WHICH IS AN AMENDING SECTION FOUR OF GOVERNMENT CODE SECTION SIX FIVE EIGHT THREE SIX. POINT SEVEN BABY. E. R. BABY OUR BABY BE TO IT THE LEADS ALL THE LANGUAGE THAT WAS IN IN THERE ABOUT THAT THIS IS SECOND APPRAISAL BUT WHEN WE GO DOWN THIS SUBSECTION HE- HAS AMENDMENTS TAKING OUT THE APPRAISAL SUBMITTED. IN AND PUTTING IN ADDITIONAL RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION. IN MY READING OF THAT MADAM CHAIR IS THAT WHEN YOU HAVE ADDITIONAL RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION THIS COULD BE ALL SORTS OF INDICIA ABOUT VALUATION ON THE- MOBILE HOME VERSUS. A TRADITIONAL PRESIDENT MUST BE DONE BY AN APPRAISAL SO I'D LIKE CLARIFICATION. WITH REGARD TO THIS ISSUE A VALUATION WHAT THE OWNER OF THE UNIT WOULD RECEIVE AND WHAT INFORMATION WOULD BE. AVAILABLE FOR THE- DECISION MAKER. THANK YOU WITH THE MARKUP THAT'S AT THE END AND THAT'S THE SECOND PART THAT YOU REFERRED TO IS THE LANGUAGE THAT WE'RE TRYING TO PUT IN HERE AND WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO IT SURE IS THAT THE LEGISLATIVE BODY AS IT IS. BUT STAPP CHING WHAT THE APPROPRIATE AMOUNT IS THAT THEY USE ALL RELEVANT DOCUMENTATION. AND THAT THEY MAKE A FINDING. SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE. FLEXIBILITY TO THE LOCAL JURISDICTION IN ORDER TO MAKE THE APPROPRIATE DETERMINATIONS ON. WHAT THE FORMAL HOUSING THERE LOSING BUT ALSO HOW THEY PROTECT THAT PARTICULAR HOMEOWNER WHO MIGHT BE LOSING THEIR HOME AND NOT BE ABLE TO BE THIS PLACE TO ANOTHER PARK SO THIS IS AN EFFORT TO BUILD IN SOME FLEXIBILITY AND ALLOW THAT LOCAL JURISDICTION TO DO WHAT IT CAN DO IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE RESIDENTS. IN THEIR OWN CITY MANAGER MANAGER WITH THAT EXPLANATION ABOUT THE EXPANSION OF DATA OR INFORMATION THAT CAN BE USED AND SUBMITTED BY THAT THE OWNERS OF THE COACHES I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU THANK YOU SENATOR Y. CASKEY SENATOR BOARD USE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT MAN POSE THREE ZERO A QUESTION TO ONE OF THE SPEAKERS I THINK- IF I CAUGHT HIS NAME- WAS THE TOURNEY EICHER LAST LAST NAME CURTAINS. HOME AGO. YES I THINK- YOU STILL PRESENT WITH US PLEASE FEEL FREE TO POST YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU I WANTED TO. JUST GOT OF UP ON SOMETHING THAT I THINK IT WAS YOU THAT MENTIONED. WHEN YOU. WHEN YOU HAVE IT YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT COMPLEX. THEY GETS CONVERTED THE TAPE TO CONDOS. IS THERE A MANDATORY RELOCATION PROGRAM IN PLACE IN SUCH A WAY THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE OWNER OF THE CONVERTING APARTMENT SYSTEM TO PAY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. RENTS ELSEWHERE OR ANY SORT OF SUPPLEMENTAL SUPPORT THAT IS MARKET RESPONSIVE. YEAH I APOLOGIZE CENTER YOU GIVE ME A BIT OF A PROMOTION I AM NOT MYSELF AN ATTORNEY I TO MY KNOWLEDGE I I'M NOT AWARE OF THAT BUT ALL DEFERRED MISTER GOVERNOR HE DOES NOW HELLO SIR I THOUGHT YOU WERE YOU WORK AT A LAW FIRM. FIVE I JUST HEARD A BUNCH THE LAST NAMES I JUST ASSUMED IT WAS A LOFT. IF IT'S ANY KIND. SOME WOULD CONSIDER THAT A PROMOTION IT AND SOME. THAT ARE TO DEMOTION SO. BUT MR GOVERNOR SHOULD LIKE TO RESPOND TO THE QUESTION WOULD YOU REPHRASE IT THE BRIEFLY SO THAT WE COULD- TRYING TO UNDERSTAND. IS IT BECAUSE OF MOBILE HOMES ARE. A BIT OF A DIFFERENT BREED IN SO FAR AS- THEY ARE NOT AS PLENTIFUL. AS APARTMENTS. THAT IN AN APARTMENT CONVERSION SCENARIO- IT. IS EXPECTED THAT THE OWNER OF THE APARTMENT THAT IS CONVERTING THEM TO CONDOS. TAKES ON THE RESPONSIBILITY. THAT ARE SIMILAR TO WHAT WE THIS BILL MMHM. ACTUALLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS SET THE NEW STANDARD FOR MOBILE HOME PARK CLOSURES ONLY PRIOR TO THIS BILL IN CURRENTLY IN LAW MOBILE CLOSURES ARE THEY ARE FOR MOBILE HOME PARKS IN THEIR SPECIFIC TO IT- IN TERMS OF MOBILE HOME PARKS WE HAVE NOT FOUND ONE THAT DOESN'T TAKE INTO ACCOUNT RELOCATION CLASS- WE HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN AN EXAMPLE RESIDENTS WEREN'T ADEQUATELY COMPENSATED AND MOVED IN SO I CAN'T REALLY SPEAK TO THE APARTMENT CONTACTS IN ITSELF BUT I DO KNOW WHEN IT COMES TO RELOCATION COSTS IN MOBILE HOME PARKS AND THEY'RE ADEQUATE AND FOR INSTANCE IN SAN JOSE ON THE WINCHESTER MOBILE HOME PARK. RESIDENTS WERE GIVEN TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR THEIR COACH AND WERE GIVEN THE RIGHT TO MOVE TO AN AFFORDABLE APARTMENT BUILDING ON THAT VERY SAME PROPERTY AT THE EXACT SAME RENT THEY WERE PAYING BEFORE. ALRIGHT THAT HELPS. THANK YOU THANK YOU MY OF MY LAST MY LAST FALL OR I THINK YOU HAD MENTIONED EARLIER THAT. THERE ARE SUFFICIENT LEGAL SAFEGUARDS THAT EXIST WITHIN THE STATE AND CERTAINLY AT THE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL. IN YOUR OPINION THAT THIS LEGISLATION IS NOT. NEEDED CAN YOU EXPAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ON. YOUR POINTS EARLIER BECAUSE I WASN'T CERTAIN I CAUGHT ALL OF THEM. THANK YOU YES. WE WOULD EXPECT BASED ON THE CONTENTION OF THE BILL THAT THERE WOULD BE AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE PARK CLOSE AND RESIDENTS WEREN'T GIVEN ADEQUATE COMPENSATION OR RELOCATION COSTS. TO GET THOSE EXAMPLES WERE NEVER GIVEN WHICH MEANS THAT OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES OF MOBILE HOME PARK CLOSURES THAT ARE TURNING TO THE WORKING ON THE REALLY HASN'T BEEN A PROBLEM BECAUSE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS REALLY DO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE RESIDENTS NOT THE PARK OWNER BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT. FIVE HUNDRED RESIDENTS ON THEIR DOORSTEP COMPLAINING ABOUT COST AND SO WE HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE EXAMPLE SO WE'RE NOT SURE WHY THIS BILL IS EVEN NEEDED BECAUSE NOTHING'S BEEN SHOWN TO BE BROKEN OVER THE PAST TWENTY YEARS. OKAY THANK YOU. I THINK AND ALL IT ALL IN HERE THAT. WE'VE DEALT WITH RENT CONTROL. ISSUES IS- THIS YEAR AND CERTAINLY LAST YEAR. AND IT COMES DOWN I THINK PHILOSOPHY DO YOU BELIEVE THAT. EITHER DIRECTLY FROM THE STATE OR INDIRECTLY FROM THE LOCALITY. THAT RENT CONTROL WOULD HELP- OUR HOUSING STOCK. I THINK BASED ON THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD WITH WITH BUILDERS. WITH FOLKS THAT CAPITALIZE. THOSE IN DEVELOPMENT- AND THOSE THAT MIGHT OTHERWISE BE INTERESTED IN. INCREASING THE HOUSING STOCK. IS THAT. WHEN YOU DISINCENTIVE VISE THE MARKET IN SUCH A WAY IT WILL ACTUALLY COMPOUND THE PROBLEM I DON'T MEAN UNDERVALUED THAT THE ISSUES AND- IN AREAS THAT I THINK HAVE OUT PRICED. OF VIRTUALLY EVERYBODY AND I THINK WE KNOW THE EXAM OF SOME OF THE BARE AND ELSEWHERE WHERE PEOPLE JUST SIMPLY CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THE OUTRAGEOUS RATES. BUT I WOULD CAUTION. AS A MATTER OF POLICY. THAT THOSE LIMITED INSTANCES. ON THE COAST BE APPLIED STATEWIDE AS POLICY. RENT CONTROL IS A DISINCENTIVE TO INVESTING IN OUR HOUSING STOCK. AND I THINK THERE'S BEEN ENOUGH STUDIES- ON THE SUBJECT THAT. IT COMES DOWN TO A PHILOSOPHICAL STANDPOINT BUT IT'S NOT A FACTUAL ONE SO MY OPINION- WHEN YOU ADD IN. ALL THESE DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES ARE WE ACTUALLY HELPING OUR HOUSING STOCK. BY THIS TYPE OF PIECE OF LEGISLATION OR THOSE SIMILAR AND I THINK THE ANSWER'S GOING TO PROVE- THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO MOVE THE NEEDLE IN CALIFORNIA. WITH OUR HOUSING CRISIS IN WAYS THAT WE OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE IMAGINED AND ULTIMATELY IT'S A IT'S A DOOMED- ALMOST IRREVERSIBLE PROCESS. THANK YOU SEEN NO OTHER HAND UP THE WHICH IS ONE OF THE POINT OUT THE MOBILE HOME PARKS ARE NOT THE SAME AS APARTMENT BUILDINGS YOU ARE THE MOBILE HOME IS REALLY NOT VERY MOBILE. AND SO THEY ARE IN A BIND IF THE PARK CLOSES IT'S NOT LIKE AN APARTMENT BUILDING THAT. SHUTS DOWN BECAUSE UNLIKE TENANT IN AN APARTMENT BUILDING THE MOBILE HOMEOWNER LOSES A MAJOR ASSET WHICH IS HIS OR HER HOME. SO AND IT'S OFTEN THEIR ONLY MAJOR ASSET- SO I THINK THIS BILL DOES A BETTER JOB OF COMPENSATING THEM FOR THAT LOSS AND I THINK THE AMENDMENTS MAKE CLEAR WE ARE NOT TYING THE HANDS OF THE LOCALS WHEN THEY DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT TO APPROVE A PARK CLOSURE TO CALL THE PARK OWNERS BUT NINE IS PROBABLY A FIRST IN MY- CAREER HERE AT THE- THE BATTLES BETWEEN THE A PARK OWNERS IN THE HOMEOWNERS ARE LEGEND- AND CONTINUE. TO THIS VERY DAY- THE QUESTION OF RENT CONTROL. NOTHING IN THE BILL REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS- TO IMPOSE RENT CONTROL. ON MOBILE HOMES- AND IF THEY DECIDE TO DO IT NOTHING REQUIRES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. TO APPLY THAT RENT CONTROL TO LONG TERM LEASES SO- I THINK WE HAVE TO BE CLEAR WITH THIS BILL DOES AND DOESN'T TO. AND I SEE THIS BILL ALSO IS RETURNING LOCAL CONTROL ON ON THIS ISSUE AND- IF THE OPPONENTS THINK THAT EXEMPTING LONG TERM LEASES FROM LOCAL RENT CONTROL IS BETTER POLICY- I INVITE YOU TO CONVINCE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF THAT I KNOW THAT THE LEADERSHIP IN THE CITY OF CARPINTERIA WHICH IS IN MY DISTRICT- FEELS VERY DIFFERENTLY AND STRONGLY ACTUALLY SUPPORTS THIS BILL. AND I AM HAPPY TO DO SO AS WELL APPRECIATE YOUR BRINGING IT- ASSEMBLY MEMBER STONE AND SEE THE SEEING NO OTHER COMMENTS AND WHAT HAVE YOU PLEASE FEEL FREE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I REST ON YOUR ARTICULATE STATEMENT.

STAY HERE IS THAT. AGAIN JUST FOR THE VISUALS FOR THOSE WHO WERE OF THE SERGEANT JUST INSTRUCTED ME TO PRESENT FROM MY DESK. VERY GOOD THEN THE FLOOR'S YOURS FROM YOUR DESK SENATE MONEY YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I'M PRESENTING AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY THREE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS. ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR ASSISTANCE SHE APPRECIATES THEIR TIME AND FEEDBACK ON THIS BILL. WITH THE INCREASED UNEMPLOYMENT AND ECONOMIC CRISIS EMERGING FROM THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. CALIFORNIANS WHO MAY ALREADY BE IN DEBT ARE LIKELY TO FIND THEMSELVES IN EVEN GREATER FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. AS A RESULT OF OUR CURRENT RECESSION SOME LOCAL CONSUMERS AND HOMEOWNERS MAY ALSO BE FACING THE THREAT OF LOSING THEIR HOMES. THE EAST BAY COMMUNITY LAW CENTER RECENTLY COMPLETED A REPORT THAT INVESTIGATED THE PROCESS WHERE CREDITORS HAVE BEEN SEEKING TO FORECLOSE UPON HOMES FOR SMALL AMOUNTS OF DEBT. THE PRACTICE OF FORCED HOME SALES BASED ON SMALL AMOUNTS OF DEBT IS PROBLEMATIC IN EXACERBATES THE EXISTING HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA. IN PARTICULAR THIS PRACTICE HAS BEEN DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTING LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTY THREE WILL ENSURE THAT LOW INCOME HOMEOWNERS IN CALIFORNIA WILL NOT LOSE THEIR HOME. THERE A DAY. IN WILL FORECLOSURES ON A PERSON'S PRINCIPAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE IF THE CONSUMER DEBT IS NOT TIED TO THEIR HOME. THE CALIFORNIA BANKERS ASSOCIATION SUBMITTED A LATE FORMAL OPPOSITION LETTER TO THE COMMITTEE YESTERDAY. ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE I'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THE POINTS RAISED IN THEIR LETTER. THE CHANGE TO PREVIOUS LANGUAGE WAS TO ADDRESS QUESTIONS RAISED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL AS WELL AS STAKEHOLDERS INVOLVED IT IS THE AUTHOR'S PERSPECTIVE THAT THE CHANGES MADE WE'RE NOT EXPANDING THE BILL BUT WE'RE DESIGNED TO CLARIFY ITS INTENT. THE INTENT OF THE BILL WAS TO LIMIT FOR CLOSURES TO DEBTS SUCH AS MORTGAGES AND HOME EQUITY LOANS THAT WERE SECURED BY THE BORROWER'S HOME AT THE TIME THAT THE DEBT WAS INCURRED. IF FORCED HOME SALES ARE PROHIBITED ONLY IN THE CASE. OF UNSECURED CONSUMER DEBT THEN SECURED CREDITORS SUCH AS A PAWN SHOP LENDERS HOME APPLIANCE AND FURNITURE LENDERS AND SECURED CREDIT CARD LENDERS WOULD RETAIN THE RIGHT TO FORECLOSE ON A DEBTOR'S HOME. THAT WOULD MEAN CREDITORS WOULD TAKE A PERSON'S HOME FOR DEBTS OF A FEW THOUSAND OR EVEN A FEW HUNDRED DOLLARS THAT IS PRECISELY WHAT THIS BILL IS DESIGNED TO STOP. THE LANGUAGE HAS BEEN REVIEWED BY THE JUDICIAL COUNCIL WHICH IS INDICATED THAT IT ADDRESSES ITS QUESTIONS THIS LANGUAGE WAS ALSO REVIEWED BY COMMITTEE STAFF IN BOTH THE ASSEMBLY AND THE SENATE. THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY CALIFORNIAN LOW INCOME CONSUMERS COALITION AND SUPPORTED BY LEGAL AID ORGANIZATIONS AND CONSUMER JUSTICE GROUPS.

I WANT TO THANK THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER FOR BRINGING THE BILL AND SENATOR MONNING FOR PRESENTING IT. YOU KNOW WE'VE BEEN FACING A HOUSING CRISIS FOR LONG BEFORE COVERT NINETEEN AND- THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN CAUSED BY THIS VIRUS IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DENIAL ABOUTTHE SCOPE OF THAT DOWNTURN IS REALLY WREAKING HAVOC ON CALIFORNIA CONSUMERS. ENFORCING A FAMILY FROM THEIR HOME IS EXTRAORDINARILY DISRUPTIVE AND DEVASTATING WE KNOW THIS SO DEBT COLLECTORS KNOW CONSUMERS WILL TAKE DRASTIC STEPS TO AVOID A FORCED HOME SALES SUCH AS TAKING OUT HIGH INTEREST LOANS UNCONSCIONABLE LOANS- OR MAKING EARLY WITHDRAWALS FROM RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS. THAT'S GOING TO DRIVE CONSUMERS INTO FAR MORE DEBT- IN THE LONG TERM AND THE PROHIBITION IN THIS BILL ON FORCED HOME SALES- IS AN ESSENTIAL CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE- I KNOW THAT THERE ARE OTHERS WHO WISH TO SPEAK ON THIS SO I WON'T GO ANY. FURTHER AND WILL THE SIMPLY CALL UPON IT WILL ASK A CENTER WHERE CASKEY AND THEN MR CENTER BORCHERS- TO GO AHEAD IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS. OR WOULD JUST LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT. MAN EARLIER ASKING MANAGER I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE IS AN AND MEASURE. CONSUMER PROTECTION MEASURE I DID HAVE A COUPLE OF QUESTIONS FOR- PROFESSOR CHRISTIAN COME MURPHY- IN AN ABUNDANCE OF CAUTION MANAGER RIGHT ONE OF THE EXCEPTIONS DEALS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE OVER SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS- WORTH OF UNSECURED DEBT. EXCEPT FOR STUDENT LOANS I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT ALL STUDENT LOANS ARE CONSECUTIVE CONSUMER DEBTS FOR PERSONAL FAMILY AND HOUSEHOLD VIEWS REGARDLESS OF THE AMOUNT THAT THEY HAVE JUST. IN A BUN SORT OF AN EASY QUESTION THAT IF THE PROFESSOR COULD IGNORE HER THANK YOU FISHER YOU STILL ON THE LINE. I'M STILL HERE WOULD YOU MISDIAGNOSIS WORKED OUT DEFENDER SAID CRAP. ALL RIGHT SO AND STE PAGE OF OUR STAFF REPORT WE TALK ABOUT THE AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS ABOUT THIS BALANCING ACT BETWEEN THE INTEREST TO CREDITORS IN THE INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS MY QUESTION PROFESSOR IS THAT. YOU KNOW SO THE DEBTS THAT YOU'VE EXCLUDED EXEMPTED ARE NON CASH CHARGE FULL DEBTS IN BANKRUPTCY YOU KNOW WAGES FOR UNEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS TAXES YOU KNOW CHILD SUPPORT AND FEES THE GOVERNMENT ARE ALREADY NOT. DOES EXEMPTION IN A IN A BANKRUPTCY ISN'T THAT ENOUGH THAT RATHER THAN IF YOU REALLY GO TO TRY TO. HELP CONSUMERS THAT WE SHOULD NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR SALES AND I AND I KNOW THAT I AGREE WITH YOU THAT THE FOR SALES ARE- REAR SOME PERHAPS YOU'RE NOT THINKING THAT DISTRICT ATTORNEYS AND COUNTY. TAX COLLECTORS ARE GOING TO GO AFTER PEOPLE'S HOUSES BUT HE MY COMMENT IS NOT GIVEN THE NON DISCHARGE ABILITY ONE WHY WOULD WE WANT TO EXEMPT THOSE TYPES OF. UNSECURED DEBT. WHY DON'T I WILL- AT STATE YOU WORK ON THAT BUT I DON'T LIKE- MIGUEL TO THAT TO ME IN ON THIS QUESTION. AS YOU MENTIONED WE TRIED TO STRIKE. A BALANCE BETWEEN- DOES THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO GET EXEMPTIONS ARE WORKING THIS BILL AND THOSE THAT WHICH WE THOUGHT. THERE WOULD BE STRONGER- POLITICAL OPPOSITION TO. REMOVING THE ART OF COURSE IN EXISTING AND PORTABILITY PROVISION AND THAT LIST WITH BLACK OUR JUDGMENT. ON THE DIFFICULTIES WE WOULD ENCOUNTER IN TRYING TO- FOR THAT THOSE OPERATORS FROM BEING ABLE TO. ATTACH A LIEN ON THE HOME AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY. FORCES SALE BUT PERHAPS THE GAL WOULD LIKE TO WAIT ON THIS BECAUSE HE HAS GREATER EXPERIENCE I WOULD NEED THAT. WORK AND YOU CAN SEE UP. THE HI THIS IS MICHELLE. THIS IS RIGHT NINETY WITH THAT WE H. IN AND BEEN AT BOTH CHECKED IN WITH SEVERAL BUT STICKLE. AND AGENCIES SUCH AS THE GENERAL OFFICE HAD. THE COMPANY CARE AND PER SE BUT INTEREST IN THIS MEASURE AND IT BEING THE WAY TO. ADDITION I THE HEART OF THIS. COMES TO ONE OF BASIC AN EXTRA ONE OF PER. TAKES OF CONCERN LOAN IT NOT UNDER OR BY THE MAJORITY OF THEM THAT FAILURE PAY THIS ONE HAPPEN ON. BECAUSE ALL AND SO WHAT WE ARE ABOUT WARRANT WITHIN THAT FIELD PER SE. OUR FOCUS HERE IS ON HELPING PEOPLE. IF THEY- ARE. TERMS OF THE LOAN MEET. THAT THEY HAD WHEN IT PROBLEM IN THIS. MADAM IN I GUESS THE GETS ME MY FACE. CARVE OUT WE WERE TALKING OF LARA ON SECURE DEBT IN THESE ARE FINANCIAL AND I KNOW THAT THE BAY ARE TO THESE ARE YOU CAN'T FIND A MORE SOPHISTICATED CREDITOR IN THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE OPERATING IN THIS IN CALIFORNIA IN THE IN THE- IN THE- STATE N. THEY HAVE ALL THE OTHER TOOLS REMEDIES THAT THE CALIFORNIA LAW APPEALS TO THEM. AND WAGE GARNISHMENT LEVYING OF BANK ACCOUNTS THEN IN GETTING A JUDGMENT AND PLACING A LIEN ON THE PROPERTY- IT SEEMS TO ME THAT IT'S- UNFORTUNATE THAT THAT WERE OPENING UP THIS DOOR TO ALLOW THESE FOR SALES TO CONTINUE WITH THE MOST SOPHISTICATED CREDITORS. THAT DEBT THAT HOLD LARGEST AMOUNT OF DEAD IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA I'M WORRISOME ABOUT WELL IT'S NOT USE NOW. D. REMEDIES IN MY- OPINION WOULD BE ADEQUATE FOR THEM TO CONTINUE TO GO ABOUT OTHER THAN OPENING UP THE DOOR AND I'M WONDERING WHY. I MEAN I GUESS I CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLITICAL SIDE BUT ACADEMICALLY YOU KNOW AND THEN SECURITY IT IS AN UNSECURED DEBT THAT'S WHAT THEY WERE AND- THEY'RE ENTITLED TO THAT STATUS. REGARDLESS OF SEVEN THOUSAND SEVEN DOLLARS OR ORDERS SEVEN CENTS. SO DOES THAT MAKE SENSE THE CONCERN THAT I HAVE. THROUGH THE CHAIR YET THROUGH CHAIR TO A PROFESSOR AT KRISHNA KUMAR FEE. HI I THINK WE BROADLY AGREE WITH THAT SENTIMENT- WHAT YOU SAID WHAT WE TRIED TO DO- YOU KNOW TO GO SHE ASIANS WITH THE OTHER SIDE WITH TO- YOU KNOW PROTECT CONSUMERS- TO THE DENTIST AND I WE THOUGHT POSSIBLE NOW AND WE LOOK AT THE BIGGEST CATEGORY DID THAT MEDICAL DEBT FOR EXAMPLE IS NOT GOING TO COME UNDER THAT. FINANCIAL INSTITUTION EXEMPTION BECAUSE THEY DON'T HOLD MEDICAL DEBT- STUDENT LOANS WHICH ARE LIKELY TO BE OR CAN BE AN ACT THAT THE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS AS FAR AS YOU MENTIONED- EXCLUDED FROM THAT EXEMPTION AND SO WHAT WE'RE LEFT WITH IS PERHAPS- CREDIT CARD DEBT OR OTHER CATEGORIES BUT IF YOU KIND OF LOOKED AT THE FEDERAL RESERVE- DATA ON WHAT THE CREDIT BALANCES THAT PEOPLE HAVE. IT EXCEEDINGLY RARE FOR THERE TO BE SOMETHING LIKE A BIG I THINK YOUR CONSUMER DEBT FACT SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT WE THOUGHT WE WERE LARGELY COULD. WE HAD A BY THE. HELLO ALL GET. I WOULD NEED FEEL THE- DID NOT BY. A CONSUMER DATA THAT WE'RE ACT. AT THAT LEVEL WE THOUGHT. THAT THAT LEVEL BE ADEQUATE. WE'RE WE HAVE IN MY WHILE COMPETING. TO THE OTHER SIDE TO LOOK FORWARD THE BILL. MAN OF. IN PARIS IS THOUGH THE- ADVOCATES HAVE CHOI THE WHY HE'S ALL ON THIS BILL RATHER THAN SOME THAT MIGHT NOT WANT. COMPROMISE THIS OF SEVENTY ISSUES AND WITH THAT. THANKS FOR. I WILLING TO MOVE THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR WORK SKI. I'M SURE THE AUTHOR THAT COMMENT OTHER QUESTIONS SOCIAL BOARD. I WOULD FISHING MADAM CHAIR. IT I WAS HOPE TO POSE A QUESTION TO OUR STAY TO CALL BEFORE YOU HAVE TIME. VENTURES OUT OKAY WELL GIVEN THE FACT THAT SENATOR WHITE HOUSE KEYS ONE THAT ASKED THE OTHER QUESTIONS AND HAS A LITTLE BACKGROUND IN THIS FIELD IT WILL WILL GO AHEAD AND ACCEPT THAT EVEN THOUGH GENERALLY THAT'S NOT THE WAY THIS WORKS BUT YOU KNOW WHAT IN IF HE HAS TO LEAVE. I'LL JUST LEAVE IT ON THE QUESTIONS FOR SOMEBODY ELSE TO ANSWER- I'M TRYING TO REMEMBER BACK PLEASE SPEAK INTO MICROPHONES- I'M TRYING REMEMBER. BANKRUPTCY BANKRUPTCY PROTECTIONS WHEN SOMEONE FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTIONS. THEY'RE STILL ALLOWED TO MAINTAIN THEIR THEIR PRIMARY. RESIDENCE AS EXEMPTS FROM WHAT. CAN BE. UGH GOING AFTER IS THAT CORRECT OR IS THAT DATED. FIVER OR MULTI THE EXTENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA EXEMPTION IS FOR SINGLE PERSON SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF EQUITY IN YOUR HOME SO TO THE EXTENT THAT YOU HAVE SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS OF EQUITY THAT'S PROTECTED FOR SALES IN A JUDICIAL FORECLOSURE AS A STAFF REPORT POINTS OUT IT PROTECTS THE SAME SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS MEAN. THIS IS SAID THIS IS ON TOP OF THE- MMHM THE HOMESTEAD EXEMPTION WHICH- I HAVE AN OPINION ON THAT ALSO PUT YOUR CORRECT OKAY. WELL I THINK WHAT I WAS. TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS WHAT ABOUT RESTRUCTURED DEBT BECAUSE I THINK THE ROUTE IT SAYS HERE THAT ON A DEBT THAT WAS SECURED BY THE DEBTORS PRINCIPAL PLACE OF RESIDENCE AT THE TIME IT WAS INCURRED. SO WHAT HAPPENS. IN A SCENARIO WHERE THE DEBT IS RESTRUCTURED SO THAT IT WAS IN KURD IN ONE SCENARIO BUT RESTRUCTURED THEREAFTER DOES THAT CHANGE THE NATURE OF THIS THROUGH THE CHAIRED BY READING A SAID IT'S THE LATTER DAY IT IS IT'S AS IT MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE YOUR VALUE OF YOUR HOME WOULD GO UP. BUT THE PROFESSOR OR MISTER SAID I DISAGREE. LET ME REPHRASE THE QUESTION IF I HAVE A SECURED IF I MAKE A TRANSACTION. AND I SECURE THAT DEBT THROUGH MY PROPERTY. I FALL INTO ARREARS LATER IN TIME. BUT THEN RESTRUCTURE THE DEBT IN ITS NOT ARE COLLATERALIZED BY MY HOUSE DOES THAT CHANGE THE DYNAMIC AT ALL. WELL I WOULD ASSUME SO SENATOR MONNING DE ARE YOU ABLE TO RESPOND TO THAT AND IF NOT WE CAN ASK NINE PREFER TO GO TO OUR EXPERTS ON THIS EITHER. MISTER SOTO. WHERE THE PROFESSOR. OR THAT OUR IN HOUSE PROFESSOR OKAY. CASEY OKAY SERIOUSLY GATHER LET'S GO TO GO TO OUR EXPERTS- MISTER SOTO OR THE PROFESSOR EITHER ONE OF YOU PREPARED TO ANSWER THAT QUESTION. AND I AM READY TO SIGN IF YOU WANT BECAUSE FIRST. GO HEAD TO GET THE- IN GENERAL WHEN YOU REFINANCE OR- BASICALLY RESTRUCTURE A LOAN. YOU USUALLY END UP CREATING A NEW CONTRACT AND SO IN THIS PARTICULAR SCENARIO THAT I UNDERSTAND CORRECTLY. SB FIRST LOAN WAS SECURITIZED. UNDER OF BE SECONDS ALONE DID NOT EXECUTING THE SOON TO COLLECT ON THAT SECOND LOAN AND SO WHATEVER RATES THAT THEY HAVE NEGOTIATED FOR THEMSELVES THEY'RE REPLYING. SO THEY WOULD BE A GREAT HOPES ARE GOING. THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO FOLLOW THE SECOND CONTRACT AND NOT THE UN SECURITIZED CONTRACT BECAUSE THAT HAD BEEN THAT PREEMPTED THE EARLIER CONTRACT THEY HAVE TO GO WITH THE ONE THAT IS OPERATIVE AT THE TIME WHICH WOULD BE THE SUBSEQUENT CONTRACT GOT IT. IN MY WRITING BUT MY LAST POINT. I HAVE A SOFT SPOT ON THIS ISSUE. BUT I'M NOT CERTAIN WHY WE CAN'T. CONSIDER. THE TAX ISSUE ALL PRETTY TAX ISSUE WHO WAS A BATTLE OF ANYBODY CAN. CAN COMMENT ON WHY BE COUNTING ASSESSMENT. WAS EXCLUDED FROM THIS IS A RETIREMENT SMALL DOLLAR AMOUNTS. WITHIN THIS BE PROBABLY WON THE MOST CREDIT CARDS IN PROPERTY TAX ARE PROBABLY THE MOST APT. SCENARIOS ARE THEN I WOULD ASSUME SENATOR MONNING WHICH I LIKE I THOUGHT I HAD AN ANSWER TO THAT BUT AGAIN I'M GOING TO DEFER TO THE EXPERTS- BECAUSE- LIST I HAVE I'M READING IT. FROM A SEPARATE LIST SO LET'S ASK THE EXPERTS THEIR RESPONSE TO THAT QUESTION ON PROPERTY TAX. WHY IT'S BEEN EXEMPTED FROM THIS BILL IS THAT THE QUESTION OR DO WE HAVE AN ANSWER FROM OUR EXPERTS. I CAN THINK OF ONE. SIMILAR TO THE- ADVANTAGE OF THIS. MOST ANTIPERSPIRANTS CHEN NEVER A LOT OF STAKEHOLDERS THAT CHECKED IN AND THERE WAS A VERY STRONG CONCERNS. ABOUT WHAT THEY CAN'T THINK PROPERTY TAXES AND HIGHLY WOULD DO FOR THE ROHINGYA OF THE SIX CALIFORNIA- I AGREE WITH YOU ON A PERSONAL LEVEL THAT IT WOULD BE NICE- THE RIGHT WORD. WE DO HELP SENIOR CITIZENS ESPECIALLY THE INTERFERES WITH PROPERTY TAXES AND IN DANGER AND HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES. BECAUSE OF UNPAID PROPERTY TAXES IN THE LOCAL POLITICAL DOLLAR RANGE. BUT. WE WERE. IT'S A COUNCIL. TO TAKE ON ONE THING A TIME. I THINK THAT TELLS PROBABLY UP ISSUE I THINK THE FIRST THING A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T LIKE PAYING TAXES WOULD DO BE TO NOT PAY THEIR PROPERTY TAXES WE NEED THE THAT KIND OF CONSISTENCY TO KEEP OUR GOVERNMENT GOING OUR SERVICES GOING I SUSPECT THAT WAS THE BASIS BOARD WE'RE TALKING PRIMARILY. CONSUMER RELATED DEBT NOT TAX RELATED DEATH I THINK THAT'S PROBABLY CLEAR FAITHS ANSWER THANK YOU ALL RIGHT WITH THAT- I'M SEEING THAT THE NO BLUE HANDS UP. ON THE SCREEN. SEND MONNING IF YOU LIKE CLOSE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND I WANT TO THANK ALL THOSE WITH MORE EXPERTISE THAN I HAVE ON THIS FOR. WEARING IN I APPRECIATE THE EXPERT WITNESSES WHO JOINED US- I DO KNOWN ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT. THE POLICY OBJECTIVES OF THIS BILL. ARE PARTICULARLY- URGENT AT THIS TIME OF COVERT NINETEEN WHERE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LOST JOBS LOST INCOMES IN MAY BE CARING WHAT WE DEFINE IN THIS BILL AS SOME LEVEL OF CONSUMER DEBT. DO NOT LOSE HOME THAT THEY'VE BUILT SOME EQUITY IN. TO SATISFY WHAT. ON THE SCALE OF THE VALUE OF THE HOME IS A RELATIVELY SMALL DEBT. IT SHOULD NOT FORCE OF FAMILY TO BECOME HOMELESS- SO I WOULD RESPECTFULLY URGE. AN AYE. VOTE ON THIS TO PROTECT THEM OF ALL. BY THAT THOSE WHO ARE FACING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP CAN KEEP THEIR HOMES I AM ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS I THINKER FOR CRAFTING THIS BILL AD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE.

UNDER CURRENT LAW A VAST MAJORITY OF CASES CONNECTED TO DR HEAPS A PHYSICIAN EMPLOYED BY UCLA WHO SEXUALLY ASSAULTED OVER TWO HUNDRED WOMEN IN THE COURSE OF HIS THIRTY FIVE YEAR CAREER ARE TIME BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE OPENED A BRIEF ONE YEAR WINDOW IN THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS FOR PATIENTS WHO'D BEEN A SEXUALLY ASSAULTED BY FORMER GYNECOLOGIST DR GEORGE TYNDALL AT USC. UNFORTUNATELY THIS CHANGE IN LAW ONLY APPLIES TO PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS EXCLUDING PUBLIC ENTITIES. YOU SEE L. AB THIRTY NINETY TWO WOULD TEMPORARILY REVIVE THOSE TIME BARRED CASES FOR ONE YEAR.

THANK YOU WITH THAT WILL BRING IT BACK TO THE FLOOR JUST DON'T WANT TO MAKE ONE OBSERVATION OF LAST YEAR OF COURSE WE HEARD- AB FIFTEEN TEN BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER RADIUS WHICH ADDRESSED THE HORRIFIC ACTS TAKING PLACE OVER THE COURSE OF DECADES AT USC- AND THERE WAS CONCERN THAT. OF THIS NEEDED TO BE ADDRESSED ON A STATE LEVEL AS WELL AND- JUST SHOCKING. THE TRULY SHOCKING THAT AFTER THESE COMPLAINTS FOR DECADES HAVE BEEN RAISED AT USC AND NOW YOU SEE AAY. THAT THE SCHOOLS DID ABSOLUTELY NOTHING WHY IS IT THAT WHEN WOMEN EXPRESS THEIR CONCERNS ABOUT BEING IN THIS VULNERABLE SITUATION AND BEING. ABUSED WENT. ON DEAF EARS IS JUST A VERY DISCONCERTING STATEMENT OF TO SAY THE LEAST. I THINK FOR ALL WOMEN AND SHOULD BE FOR ALL OF US THESE ARE SOMEBODY'S CHILDREN. IS OUR STUDENTS AT OUR SCHOOLS WHO ARE ENTITLED TO AN EXPECTED TO WIN A SHOULD BE RECEIVING. THE KIND OF ARE THAT WE WOULD WANT FOR OURSELVES AND OUR OWN LOVED ONES IN THE FACT THAT THEIR CONCERNS WERE IGNORED. BY IS JUST. INCOMPREHENSIBLE AND SO- I WANT TO THANK OUR WITNESSES. FOR THEIR STRENGTH AND COURAGE IN COMING FORWARD- HOPEFULLY THIS WILL HELP WITH THE HEALING PROCESS THESE THINGS COURSE CAN NEVER BE UNDONE- AND THEY SHOULD NEVER HAPPEN IN THE FIRST PLACE SO IF WE NEED TO SEND A STRONG MESSAGE. ARE YOU ALL OF OUR HERE IT IS- BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE THIS SHOULD NEVER HAVE HAPPENED AND NEVER BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AGAIN I THINK THAT'S THE STATEMENT THIS BILL MAKES. END UP WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRING FORWARD AND- MISTER BOETTCHER CENTER BORCHERS IF YOU HAVE A COMMENT OR QUESTION PLEASE PROCEED I THINK MADAM. I THINK YOU SAID IT VERY WELL ON. THIS THINGS LIKE THIS ARE ABSOLUTELY UNCONSCIONABLE- AND I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT WE ARE ISOLATING ONE INSTITUTION. WHEN WOULD IT NOT BE BETTER AS A MATTER OF POLICY. TO CHANGE THE STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS ISSUES MORE BROADLY. HAVE IT APPLIED. TO WHAT ALL SCHOOLS. AND THEN WE DEAL WITH S. C. BEFORE NOW WE'RE DEALING WITH UCLA BUT THIS KIND OF PIECEMEAL APPROACH FROM A POLICY STANDPOINT JUST CONCERNS ME THAT IT COULD BE. BETTER ADDRESSED IF THERE WERE IF THERE WERE REFORMS ACROSS THE BOARD IN TERMS OF SEXUAL IMITATIONS SO I'LL CERTAINLY BE SUPPORTING IT BUT- IF WE IF WE HEAR ANOTHER SCHOOL. WHETHER IT'S IN THE UC SYSTEM THE CSU SYSTEM OR A PRIVATE SYSTEM IF WE HEAR THAT A SITUATION LIKE THIS OCCUR AGAIN ARE WE JUST GONNA GO SCHOOL BY SCHOOL BY SCHOOL OVER THE COURSE OF THE YEARS I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S MORE POLICY I THINK WE SHOULD BE EVALUATING- SUCH LIMITATIONS REFORM. THANK YOU I WILL NOTE THAT WE HAVE EXPANDED THE STATURE LIMITATIONS ON THESE. OFFENSES ARE GOING FORWARD I THINK WE DID THAT A FEW YEARS AGO TO TEN YEARS- WE'VE DONE IT WITH COURSE WE HAD THE SITUATION WITH THE CHURCH. CATHOLIC CHURCH AND- EXPANDED THAT STATUE LIMITATIONS I MEAN THE BOTTOM LINE THIS IS GOT TO STOP. THIS JUST CANNOT BE ALLOWED TO HAPPEN AND I THINK WE HAVE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. A TAKEN A VERY STRONG POSITION ON THIS. AND IT IS MY HOPE. THAT THE MESSAGE IS OUT THERE YOU JUST CANNOT EXPLOIT PEOPLE LIKE THIS- AND I THINK THIS ADDRESSES BUT WE KNOW TO HAVE BEEN A LONG STANDING PROBLEM- AND IS AN APPROPRIATE RESOLUTION. AT THIS POINT IN TIME I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO DO THIS EVER AGAIN- BUT- THAT BEING SAID- SENATOR. MORNING WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS- I. TWO ONE I THINK. THE WITNESSES MISS WHILE I CAN MISS CAYGLE. VICTIMS WHO SHOW GREAT COURAGE IN STANDING UP TO MOVE FORWARD NOT ONLY IN THE EXERCISE OF THEIR OWN RIGHTS BUT ON BEHALF OF OTHERS. WHO ARE ALSO VIOLATED AND I WOULD JUST CLARIFY THAT THIS BILL DOES MORE THAN SEND A MESSAGE IT CREATES AN OPPORTUNITY TO SEEK LEGAL REDRESS I THINK THE MESSAGE PART OF THIS BILL. SHOULD BE TO ALL ADMINISTRATORS IN HIGHER EDUCATION IN WORKPLACES IN MEDICAL CENTERS WHERE EVER THIS TYPE OF EGREGIOUS CONDUCT MIGHT TAKE PLACE. WHAT THIS BILL SHOULD DO IS SAY THAT YOU WILL NOT ESCAPE THE LAW BUT THE GOAL SHOULD BE TO PREVENT THIS CONDUCT. IN THE ANY HINT OF IT SHOULD BE AGGRESSIVELY INVESTIGATED. WITH THE GOAL OF PROTECTING. FUTURE VICTIMS SO WITH THAT I WANT TO THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER WICKS FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I AM HONORED TO CARRY THE BILL TODAY IN JUDICIARY COMMITTEE AND RESPECTFULLY ASK COLLEAGUES FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU.

BECAUSE THEY HAVE TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY IN A RIDE WITHOUT A REMEDY IS NOT RIGHT AT ALL.
