YOU MAY PROCEED VERY GOOD THANK YOU SENATOR WILK- THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM PRESENTING AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE ON BEHALF OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO IDENTIFY UNSPENT SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANT FUNDS FROM THE PREVIOUS CHEAPER AND USE USER FUNDS THOSE ABOUT FIVE. FOR THE- OUTCOMES OF THE INTENDED STUDENT GROUPS. UNDER THE L. C. F. F. CONCENTRATION AND SUPPLEMENTAL GRANTS ARE AIMED AT PROVIDING ADDITION RESOURCE. FOR DISTRICTS TO HELP LEARNERS LOW INCOME STUDENTS FOSTER YOUTH THESE FUNDS WERE NEVER MEANT TO BE GENERALLY ALLOCATED THIS ADDITIONAL FUNDING CAME WITH THE PROMISE OF ACCOUNTABILITY OVERSIGHT. CINCINNATI L. C. F. F. THESE GRANT PROGRAMS HAVE PAID OUT HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF ADDITIONAL DOLLARS TO SCHOOL BUT THE PROMISED LAND ABILITY NEVER MATERIALIZED. LAST YEAR ASSEMBLY MEMBERS WEBER AND FOR. REQUEST OUR SUPPORT TRANSFER BEINGS AND THEREFORE THE STATE OF THE ART OFF CHIU TO ON THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS CLOVIS OAKLAND AND SAN DIEGO UNFORTUNATELY THE HONOR AND HER TEAM OF INVESTIGATORS CONFIRMED WHAT WAS PRETTY FEARS. FOUND THAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAD THEIR UNSPENT SUPPLEMENTAL AND OR CONCENTRATION FUNDS AS PART OF THERE'S DISTRICTS GENERAL FUND THE FOLLOWING YEAR SINCE TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN SAN DIEGO CLOVIS AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS HELLO HOW OLD HUNDRED AND TWENTY POINT SIX MILLION FOR MENTAL AND CONCENTRATION FUNDS INTO THEIR BASE FUNDS. BECAUSE WE FELT IT WE HAVE GIVEN SCHOOL DOES A PERVERSE INCENTIVE TO IGNORE THE NEEDS OF OUR MOST DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AND APPROPRIATE THOSE FUNDS FOR OTHER PURPOSES. THIS LACK OF ACCOUNTABILITY PERPETRATES A SYSTEM THAT ALLOWS BLACK BROWN LOW INCOME ENGLISH LEARNERS AND STUDENTS IN FOSTER CARE TO FALL BEHIND THE REST OF THEIR CLASSMATES. IN THE AFTERMATH OF COVERT NINETEEN CALIFORNIA STUDENTS WILL BE FACING A LEARNING LOS UNLIKE ANYTHING WE'VE EVER SEEN AND OUR STATE. FUNDS ALLOCATED TO LOW PERFORMING STUDENTS SHOULD RETAIN THEIR DESIGNATION IN GOOD AND BAD TIMES. THIS WILL BE EVEN MORE IMPORTANT POST CODE NINETEEN WOULD STUDENTS WILL PROBABLY FALL EVEN FURTHER BEHIND WITHOUT THE FULL MEASURE OF THESE RESOURCES. AND THE STATE WERE ONLY THIRTY ONE POINT 3% OF BLACK STUDENTS AND THIRTY SEVEN POINT 3% OF LATINO STUDENTS. MEET STANDARDS IN ENGLISH IT IS IMPERATIVE THAT THE SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION FUNDS MEANT TO ASSIST THE STUDENTS RETAINED THEIR DESIGNATION. AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE WILL PROVIDE THE ACCOUNTABILITY NECESSARY TO PROTECT THE CRITICAL EDUCATIONAL SUPPORT OF THESE FUNDS. ABILITY MATTERS TO THE TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN IN THIS STATE WHO ARE NOT GETTING THE EDUCATION THAT THEY NEED OR DESERVE. ON BEHALF OF DOCTOR WEBER I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR FIVE OF.

THE LEGISLATURE AND STAKEHOLDERS VOICE MANY CONCERNS ABOUT THIS PROPOSAL AND THE IMPACT THAT IT COULD HAVE ON UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS. WELL THE CSU ULTIMATELY DECIDED TO DELAY THE VOTE ON THIS PROPOSAL AND TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS TO EVALUATE ITS IMPACT IT UNDERSCORED THE NEED TO DEVELOP A CLEAR AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS TO FOLLOW WHEN CONSIDERING THE ADOPTION OF NEW ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM MODERATOR THIRTY THANK YOU WELL WE'RE GOING TO GO NOW TO LEAD OPPOSITION- MARQUITA GRIN NOTE SHARE ARE YOU ON THE LINE. I AM GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. MY NAME IS MARCADO CORNELL SHIRE I SERVICE THE ASSISTANT VICE CHANCELLOR OF EDUCATOR PREPARATION AND PUBLIC SCHOOL PROGRAM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. BEFORE I BEGIN WITH LIKE. BUT CASE. WE BELIEVE OUR GOAL AND MISSION ARE ALIGNED AND THAT WE BOTH. WANT TO ENSURE ALL STUDENTS HAVE ACT TO HIGHER. ESPECIALLY THOSE STUDENTS FROM UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AS YOU THE CSU THE MOST DIVERSE FOUR YEAR PUBLIC UNIVERSITY SYSTEM IN THE NATION. THE CSU IS ALSO ONE OF THE MOST SUCCESSFUL INSTITUTIONS WITH THE STUDENT BODY THAT IS THE MOST ETHNICALLY ECONOMICALLY AND ACADEMICALLY DIVERSE IN THE NATION. THIS IS NOT BY ACCIDENT IT IS OUR MISSION. BUT CSU STRIVES TO CREATE A WELCOMING ENVIRONMENT WHICH PLACES EMPHASIS ON STUDENT SUCCESS. THIS IS EVIDENT BY THE FACT THAT THE CITY PROVIDES MORE THAN HALF OF ALL UNDERGRADUATE DEGREES EARNED BY CALIFORNIA'S LATINO AFRICAN AMERICAN AND NATIVE AMERICAN STUDENTS. NEARLY ONE THIRD OF UNDERGRADUATES ARE THE FIRST AND THEIR FAMILIES TO ATTEND COLLEGE. THESE PERCENTAGES ILLUSTRATE THE LONGSTANDING WORK OF CSU ADMINISTRATORS FACULTY AND STAFF TO ENSURE OUR STUDENTS RECEIVE A QUALITY EDUCATION MATCH WITH OPPORTUNITY. AGAIN WE BELIEVE THE CSU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA ARE ALIGNED IN OUR GOALS AND MISSION. WE DIFFER HOWEVER ON THE IDEA THAT. IS SIMPLY BILL NINETEEN THIRTY PROVIDES ABOUT. OR ADD TO ACROSS. WHICH IS ALL BEEN ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. AS A PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTOR TO THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING PROPOSAL I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OCCURRED OVER TIME. AND WAS STAKEHOLDER INPUT. AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THE STAKEHOLDER INPUT THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN WAS REVISED ON MULTIPLE OCCASIONS AND EVENTUALLY BECAME WHAT IT IS TODAY. IT IS THIS PROCESS OF COOPERATION COMMUNICATION AND TRANSPARENCY THEIR RESULTED IN A PHASED IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. THE PLACES STUDENT ACCESS AND SUCCESS AT THE HEART OF THE PROPOSAL. AS A REMINDER THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN CONSISTS OF A TWO YEAR PERIOD TO THE VALUE WAIT AND STUDY THE IMPACTS OF CHANGING THE ISSUE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. SECOND THE GOALS RESENT A FINAL RECOMMENDATION TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES IN THE SPRING OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. AND THIRD THE NEW REQUIREMENTS WOULD NOT GO INTO A FACT INTO THE FALL OF TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN TO ALLOW FOR SUFFICIENT TRANSITION TIME. AS WE EVALUATE THE PROCEDURES CONTAINED IN ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN THIRTY WE RECOGNIZE SEVERAL SIMILARITIES TO THE CSU IMPLEMENTATION PLAN INCLUDING. INCREASE TRANSPARENCY TO THE SAID MIDDLE OF ANNUAL REPORT. AN EXTERNAL REVIEW BY A NONPARTISAN RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO INFORM THE IMPLEMENTATION AND THE EFFECTS OF THE PROPOSED CHANGE. THE CREATION OF A COMMITTEE TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE AND ENSURE THE PLAN PUT FORTH IS EQUITABLE AND AVOID ANY UNINTENDED IMPACTS UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS. AND THAT THE COMMITTEE WOULD BE MADE UP OF MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING STATE AND LOCAL OFFICIALS K. TWELVE DISTRICT PERSONNEL STUDENTS AND FACULTY AND COMMUNITY MEMBERS. I WOULD LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT WHAT DIFFERENCE. BUT CSU WILL BE CONVENING ITS COMMITTEE BEFORE THE BOARD APPROVED THE RECOMMENDATION AND NOT AFTER THAT'S REPOSE AND ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN THIRTY IN FACT THE CSU QUANTITATIVE REASONING COMMITTEE IS MEETING ON AUGUST ELEVENTH. THE PURPOSE OF THE CSU QUANTITATIVE REASONING STARING THE IS TO INFORM. GUIDANCE AND DEVELOP AND MONITOR METRICS TO ASSESS THE IMPACTS AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE PROPOSED CHANGES ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS. THE CSU QUANTITATIVE REASONING STIR STEERING COMMITTEE IS COMPOSED OF THE CHAIR AND VICE CHAIR OF EDUCATIONAL POLICY. THE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION. THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE EDUCATION ADVISER. RESIDENTS OF THE STATE BOARD OF EDUCATION. BUT CHAIR OF THE CSU ACADEMIC SENATE. THE CHIEF ACADEMIC OFFICER OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE. I CSU STUDENT REPRESENTATIVE A PUBLIC SCHOOL DISTRICT STATE SUPERINTENDENT IF YOU COULD WRAP BUT I'M PLEASE ACTIVE DIRECTOR OF EDUCATION TRUSTS LAST. WE UNDERSTAND THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS WITH YOU'VE YEARS ARE ALL ALL OF YOUR TIME AND THEN SUMMER WRAP UP PLEASE. OKAY OUT FOR- WE DON'T BELIEVE ASSEMBLY BILL NINETEEN THIRTY ADDS VALUE ARE BENEFITS TO THE CSU AND FOR THESE REASONS WE MUST RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY WE'RE GOING TO LOOK FOR OPPOSITION- HERE IN THE ROOM AND FORTY TWO OH THREE SEEING AND HEARING NONE WHAT TWENTY FORTY. SEEING THAT THERE LET'S GO TO THE PHONES TELEPHONICALLY MADAME. MODERATOR PLEASE QUEUE UP ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE NINETEEN THIRTY PLEASE. AND LADIES AND GENTLEMEN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF A. B. NINETEEN THIRTY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. AND AGAIN IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION OF A. B. NINETEEN THIRTY PRESS ONE AND THEN ZERO. THERE WE HAVE NO ONE IN K&lt;c.cyan&gt;. OKAY THANK YOU VERY&lt;/c&gt; MUCH WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE DO WE HAVE ANY QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONCERNS SENATOR PAN. THANK YOU AND WITHIN A THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD- I DID HAVE A QUESTION ABOUT THE PROVISIONS REGARDING AFTER- ADOPTIONS THERE'S IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE- I UNDERSTAND AND- DISPOSE OF I IN IN YOUR PROGRESS REPORT- DOES IT BETWEEN THE PERIOD OF PROOF FOR SUCH I CLEAR FIVE. THE UP PROGRESS SUPPORT AFTER THE CHANGE AND ELIGIBILITY POLICY SO IS THERE. IS THIS SOMETHING THEY'RE GOING TO ANNUALLY FOR AND- AD INFINITUM- OR IS IT FOR A FIXED PERIOD OF TIME I JUST WASN'T CLEAR ON THAT AND THEN. ALSO SO THE LORDS OF A YOU GONNA BE STILL RECEIVING REPORTS TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OR WAS THAT THE INTENT OR NOT AND THEN ALSO- GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW POSSIBLY THERE COULD BE MORE THAN ONE CHANGE OVER TIME IS THERE SOMETHING THAT SEPARATE IMPLEMENTATION COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWS EACH CHANGERS OF ONE COMMITTEE THAT REVIEWS ALL THE CHANGES ONE COULD. STOP CHANGE ONE YEAR AND TEN YEARS LATER DR JANE SO YOU CLARIFY THIS ISSUE SELFISH IT. AFTER I HAVE ON THE- YEAH. BUT I KNOW THAT IT'S CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE THE INTENT OF THE BILL TO HAVE- YOU KNOW- IMPLEMENTATION REPORTS GOING OUT TWENTY FIVE YEARS LATER I AT AT WITH THE BILL. ADDRESSES IS WHAT HAPPENED AND THAT IS THAT- EVEN THOUGH THE LEGISLATURE HAD HEARINGS ON THE TOPIC WERE WE HEARD FROM- THE- CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND WE WERE HEARING FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS- AND I BELIEVE ALSO THE- SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION- THERE WAS NO RESPONSE THERE WAS NO RESPONSE FROM CSU- AND IT WAS ONLY. AFTER A I INTRODUCED THE BILL THAT I THINK THAT WE GOT A RESPONSE. AND SO WITH THE BILL AGAIN TRIES TO DO IS TO MAKE SURE THAT SEE ISSUE- INTERACTS AND I. AGREE WITH THE CSU PRESENTER- THAT I AM IN LINE WITH THEM ON ON THEIR GOAL I SEE HOW WELL THEY DO- AND- UPWARD MOBILITY TO STUDENTS BUT WHAT I DID NOT SEE. WAS INTERACTION. WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THE LEGISLATURE SOME OF THE BILL AGAIN TRIES TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN. EIGHTY THANK YOU SENATOR PAN OUR NEXT UP WE HAVE SENATOR GLAZER CENTER GLAZER ONE WAY FOR YOU TO APPEAR ON THE SCREEN ALL RIGHT WE SEE YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU AT CHAIR LEYVA LET ME PERSIST EXPRESSED BY APPRECIATE TO YOU ABOUT OF CHAIR FOR ALLOWING ME TO PARTICIPATE. REMOTELY HAD TO THE COMMITTEES AS WELL SO THANK YOU FOR THAT. I HAD A COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANTED ASKED THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THIS CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. TO SPEAK TO THE ISSUE OF THE PROCESS AND THE TRANSPARENCY OF THE PROCESS THEY WENT THROUGH. PRIOR TO THE- DISCUSSION AND BOAT THEY TOOK OUT THIS PAST JANUARY. THE QUESTION WAS TO ME CENTER. IT WAS A CO FOR CENTER GLAZERS BIG THE QUESTION WAS FOR THE REPRESENTATIVE FROM THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY GREAT MY SON. SHE WENT THROUGH HIS CORNER SHIRE ARE USED ON THE PHONE. I AM THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR GLAZER- AS YOU MAY RECALL THAT SHE IS YOU HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN THE CONSULTATION PROCESS FOR APPROXIMATELY FOUR YEARS- WE BEGAN TO WORK WITH OUR- STATEWIDE ACADEMIC SENATE. AND WE ENGAGED A NUMBER OF K. TWELVE- CONSTITUENTS IN AS WE DEVELOP THE PROPOSAL- OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES MINUTES- CAN BE PROVIDED AGAIN. SO THAT YOU CAN SEE THE WIDE VARIETY. OF LOCAL AND STATE DISTRICT AND COUNTY- OF REPRESENTATIVES AS WELL AS A WIDE VARIETY OF COMMUNITY BASED GROUPS THAT WE INTERACTED WITH ON AN ONGOING BASIS. AND SO. WE FEEL VERY COMFORTABLE THAT THE CONSULTATION PROCESS. PROVIDED US WITH THE WIDE VARIETY OF INPUT FROM ALL OF THESE MEMBERS AS WELL AS OUR OWN STUDENTS THAT LED TO THE CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN- THAT WILL TAKE EFFECT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AND COULD YOU ALSO SPEAK TO THE INDEPENDENT. THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS AGREED TO UNDERTAKE AS PART OF THEIR PROPOSAL. I CAN SO WE ARE CURRENTLY- IN CONVERSATION WITH A NONPARTISAN- RESEARCH ORGANIZATION- TO- DEVELOP. CON IF YOU WILL TO HELP US INFORMED THE IMPLEMENTATION PLAN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS- I AM NOT READY AT THIS POINT IN TIME TO IDENTIFY THAT NONPARTISAN GROUP BUT WE HAVE BEEN AND CONVERSATIONS WITH THEM OVER THE SUMMER MONTHS. AND COULD YOU SPEAK TO THE AND THE PRESENT THE COMPLETION OF THE INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY THE TIME LINE FOR THAT. AND AT HOW AND THE- THAT WILL- WILL BE IN EFFECT OR NOT IN EFFECT IN TERMS OF PRESENTING THE FINDINGS. AND TO WHOM DOES IT GO TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE AS A GO TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES WHAT'S THE PROCESS FOR. THE DISCLOSURE OF THAT INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS AND FINALLY CAN YOU PUT THAT IN THE CONTEXT OF ANY FUTURE DECISION BY THE BOARD AS TO WHETHER THEY WANT TO CARRY OUT. OUR THIS SEVEN YEAR FACED AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN. YES AS I MENTIONED- WE HAVE TO REPORT TO OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES BY TWENTY TWENTY TWO. THE REPORT BY THE NONPARTISAN RESEARCH ORGANIZATION- WILL BE GIVEN TO THE QUANTITATIVE REASONING STEERING COMMITTEE AS I MENTION. THIS QUANTITATIVE REASONING STEERING COMMITTEE IS COMPOSED OF A NUMBER OF REPRESENTATIVES AND I'D BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE THE ACTUAL WHICH TO- THIS GROUP IF YOU SO DESIRED. BUT THIS STATE COMMITTEE. WILL TAKE THE FIND DEAN'S- BUT- NONPARTISAN RESEARCH ORGANIZATION TO HELP INFORM THE REPORT THAT WILL BE GIVEN TO OUR BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND SPRING TWENTY TWENTY TWO. PRIOR TO THE ACTUAL TITLE FIVE CHANGE. AND SO IT IS ABOUT% RECORD THAT IT'S PRESENTED AT THE STEERING COMMITTEE THAT WILL BE PRESENTED TO THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES THERE WILL BE A MATE IT WILL BE MADE AVAILABLE PUBLICLY. VERY GOOD AND BAD I'M SURE IF I COULD ADDRESS A QUESTION TO THE AUTHOR YES PLEASE PROCEED. ASSEMBLY MEMBER THANK YOU FOR YOUR- ENGAGEMENT AND PASSION ON THIS ISSUE OF ELEGY AND ITS EFFECT ON ON REPRESENTED STUDENTS I SHARE. YOUR GOALS THAT YOU HAVE LAID OUT OUR I AT THE THAT THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES HAS ENACTED. A SEVEN YEAR PHASE AND WITH SEEMINGLY OFFRAMP STE TO EXAMINE AN INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY ANALYSIS AND WHEN I LOOK AT THE MEMBERSHIP OF THAT COMMITTEE IT SEEMS LIKE THEY'RE DOING EVERY THING. IS IN YOUR BILL- THAT DID THAT THE SAME CONCERNS THAT YOU HAVE REYES WERE CONCERNS THAT WERE RAISED DURING THE DELIBERATION PROCESS BY THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES. I WAS A THOROUGH CONVERSATION DIVERT THE UP MINUTES FROM THE JANUARY MEETING EARLIER THIS YEAR WHERE THEY ADOPTED THAT PHASED IN APPROACH AND I'M I GUESS I'D LIKE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT A AGAIN. IF IT THEY SEEM TO BE A LAW WITH THE CAN YOU PHRASE AND PROCESS THAT YOU IDENTIFIED A- AT A EIGHT INCLUSIVE GROUP TO KIND OF DO THE EXAMINATION. WHAT IS IT IN YOUR BILL THAT DIFFERS AND I GUESS I'M LOOKING FOR THAT CASE AGAIN ABOUT WHY THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD. INTERVENE WHEN THEY SEEM TO BE DOING EVERYTHING. THAT YOU WANT. THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION CENTER GLAZER. AND I WOULD AGREE THAT THIS ENDED WELL THAT- THIS- EFFORT ON THE PART OF CSU TO INTRODUCE. CHANGE THE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENT OF ENDED WELL ENDED WITH WITH WHAT WE WANTED WAS WAS TO POSTPONE THAT ARE OR OR TO GET RID OF THAT- IF IT IF IT IS ONLY A POSTPONEMENT BUT BUT WHAT WE SAW WAS PROCESS OR OR LACK OF THAT AND SO I THINK WITH THE INTENT OF THIS BILL IS TO MAKE SURE TO BE CERTAIN THAT THE NEXT TIME NOT NOT FOR A QUANTITATIVE REASONING BUT THE NEXT TIME THAT THE CS YOU MAY WANT TO ADD. ANOTHER FIREMAN IN IN THE ENTRANCE REQUIREMENT THAT THE LEGISLATURE NOT BE LEFT OUT IN THE DISCUSSION AND HEARD FROM C. ISSUE THAT THEY HAD- MEETINGS WITH MANY STAKEHOLDERS AND THAT IT WAS A FOUR YEAR PROCESS BUT I CAN DO THAT AT SIXTY FOR ASSEMBLY DISTRICT WHERE I WAS TEACHER OF RIVERSIDE UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AND A BOARD MEMBER OF THE GROUP A UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT SITE TO THERE THEY WERE NOT A- THE- THEY WERE NOT. ALTHOUGH UP TO THE POINT WHERE TRUSTEES WE'RE GONNA A VOTE SO AGAIN A SEVEN GLAZER FOR THE LEADS. IS THAT THAT NOT HAPPEN AGAIN. US BY THAT WOULD YOU KNOW ASK THIS COMMITTEE- TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE BILL. YOUR LEYVA IF I CAN SPEAK THAT ON MY OWN TIME YES PLEASE PROCEED. WELL LET ME AGAIN THANK THE AUTHOR HE'S A PASSIONATE ADVOCATE FOR OUR HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM VERY FEW IN THE LEGISLATURE MATCHED. BY HIS- GREAT LEADERSHIP ON A HIGHER EDUCATION BATTERS AND I SO APPRECIATE AT AND ADMIRE. THAT LEADERSHIP. AND WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS- YOU KNOW A IT'S ALWAYS DIFFICULT- IN A STATE AS LARGE AS CALIFORNIA. I WITH MORE THAN A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY IS AT THE TABLE HI EVERYBODY IS AWARE AND INFORMED ITS CITY OF ITS ONGOING CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE WITHIN OUR OWN. LEGISLATIVE BODY BATTERS THAT WE- CONSIDER. UP BUT FOR ME IT SEEMS THAT THE TRUSTEES. HAVE ENGAGED IN AN OPEN TRANSPARENT WAY ON THIS VERY DIFFICULT TOPIC. AND I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF TRUSTEES THAT DIFFERS. WITH THE CONCERNS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS RAISED ON THIS PARTICULAR MATTER THAT OF UNDER REPRESENTED STUDENTS AND WHETHER OR NOT THIS NEW REQUIREMENT WHICH- CREATES SOME ELIGIBILITY CONCERNS I I'D I THINK EVERYBODY'S ON THE SAME PAGE. AND SO FOR ME WHEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE THESE ISSUES I ALWAYS TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHETHER OR NOT. BUT THERE'S A IT'S A COMPELLING REASON FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO END INTERVENE. AT ESTABLISH NEW LAW. BECAUSE OF WHAT REASONS LACK OF RUST. LACK OF HONESTY- BUT WE HAVE SET UP THIS BOARD OF TRUSTEES TO DO OUR- POLICY. WORK AND NOT FOR THE STATE UNIVERSITIES WE IN THE SENATE. REVIEW AND APPROVE EVERY. GUBERNATORIAL NOMINEE TO THAT BOARD AND IT GIVES US THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A BOARD THAT'S DIVERSE AND- AND RESPECTED AND EDUCATED TO DO THAT WORK OUR BEHALF SO THAT'S THE SCREEN THAT I USE IN LOOKING AT BILLS LIKE THIS WITH THE BEST OF INTENTIONS BUT YET INTERFERING IN A WAY THAT ISN'T NECESSARILY JUSTIFIED AND UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S WHAT I FEEL AND THIS PARTICULAR CASE BUT IT'S NOT WITHOUT GREAT RESPECT FOR THE AUTHOR. AND THE GOOD WORK HE IS TRYING TO ADVANCE YOUR TODAY THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER GLAZER MEMBERS ARE THERE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS YES SENATOR PAN.

OF CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS OF FROM ALL OF THE DIFFERENT- GROUPS. VERY LENGTHY OF YOU KNOW ALL ALL HAVING THE SAME CONCLUSION- THAT- IT WILL THIS IS GONNA BE SOMETHING THAT WAS DETRIMENTAL- TO- STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND I THINK THEY SHARED MY CONCERNS THEY SHARED MY CONCERN OF THE LACK OF INTERACTION AND SO. YOU KNOW I KNOW I WAS CAUGHT BY SURPRISE- WITH THIS MEASURE- AND WHAT WAS STRIKING WAS THE MOST STRIKING TO ME AGAIN WAS THE LACK OF RESPONSE SO THAT EVEN AFTER I HAD THAT HEARING SENATOR PAN I WAS NEVER.

OKAY GREAT THANK YOU MEDI CARE AND MEMBERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN. THIS BILL WILL REQUIRE COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES TO CONSIDER. HOMELESSNESS AS AN EXTEND CIRCUMSTANCE WHEN THEY EVALUATE APPEALS THIS IS IN THE APPEAL PROCESS FOR THE LOSS OF FINANCIAL LATE. COVERT NINETEEN HAS EXACERBATED BOTH THE LIKELIHOOD THAT STUDENTS WILL STRUGGLE WITH ACADEMIC PROGRESS AS WELL AS THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THEY WILL EXPERIENCE HOMELESS. WE ALL KNOW THAT ACTS TO FINE AID IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT TO LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND STUDENTS OF COLOR. SIX HUNDRED THOUSAND STUDENTS ANNUALLY A NUMBER WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE DUE TO THE PANDEMIC. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN WILL MAKE IT MORE POSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH HOMELESSNESS TO RETAIN THEIR FINANCIAL AID REMAIN AND ROLLED. AND FULFILL THEIR DREAM- IN THEIR DEGREE. THIS BILL RECEIVED UNANIMOUS SUPPORT ON THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AS WELL AS IN THE ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE IS SUPPORTED BY A BROAD COALITION OF HOMELESSNESS EDUCATION AND EQUITY ADVOCATES. WITH ME TO TESTIFY TODAY IS DEBBIE RUSHER FROM THE JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR YOUTH AND CODY VAN FILLED IN A RECENT GRADUATE FROM AMERICAN RIVER COLLEGE. THANK IT'S A RAZA OKAY WITH IN SUPPORT OF DEBBIE RAUSCHER ARE YOU THERE. I AM THANK YOU VERY MUCH. OF MY NAME IS DEBBIE RUSHER AND I'M WITH JOHN BURTON ADVOCATES FOR USE THANK YOU CHAIR AND MEMBERS FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY. PRIOR TO THE COVER NINETEEN CRISIS 19% OF STUDENTS AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND 11% OF CSU STUDENTS REPORTED EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. IN THE FACE OF COVER NINETEEN AND THE CONSEQUENT LOSS OF INCOME FOR MANY COLLEGE STUDENTS THREE HOMELESSNESS IS LIKELY TO RISE. WHEN IS TO EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS GRAY IT'S OFTEN DROP IN MANY CONSEQUENTLY LOSE ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID BECAUSE THEY FALL BELOW SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS OR SAP STANDARDS. WHILE MOST COLLEGES OFFER THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAL THE LOSSES FINANCIALLY DUE TO SAP APPEALS PROCESS HE'S VERY TREMENDOUSLY BY CAMPUS. WILL QUALIFY AS A STUDENT FOR REINSTATEMENT IS OFTEN BASED ON THE PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY OF ANY GIVEN FINANCIAL AID ADMINISTRATOR. AND HOMELESSNESS IS NOT CONSISTENTLY CONSIDERED A VALID BASIS FOR APPEAL. SOON TO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS ARE AMONG THE MOST DISADVANTAGED OF CALIFORNIA'S COLLEGE STUDENTS AND IN THE FACE OF THE CURRENT CRISIS. THE STUDENTS SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET BACK ON TRACK RATHER THAN THEIR EXPERIENCE OF HOMELESSNESS LEADING THE END OF THEIR ACADEMIC CAREER. AB TWENTY FOUR SIXTEEN WILL OFFER STUDENTS WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS THIS OPPORTUNITY. WILL HELP TO MITIGATE THE EXACERBATION OF EXISTING DISPARITIES WITHIN OUR POST SECONDARY SYSTEMS.
