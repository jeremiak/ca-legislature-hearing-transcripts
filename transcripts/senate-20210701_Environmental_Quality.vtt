00:22:04.289 --> 00:22:06.324
TYPES OF PLASTICS FROM

00:22:06.391 --> 00:22:07.993
OVERNIGHT OVER SIMPLIFYING DATA

00:22:08.060 --> 00:22:09.661
THAT YOU'VE BEEN VISION WHAT

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:11.697
THERE WILL BE A WHOLE CLOSED

00:22:11.763 --> 00:22:14.199
LOOP WHICH IS THE THERMAL FORM

00:22:14.266 --> 00:22:19.004
PLASTICS. N. I THINK THE OBJECT

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:19.571
THE OBJECTION IS THAT IF THE

00:22:19.638 --> 00:22:20.372
MARKET DOESN'T. BUILD UP IN THE

00:22:20.439 --> 00:22:22.541
NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS CAN WE

00:22:22.607 --> 00:22:24.443
SUBSTITUTE WITH RECYCLED

00:22:24.509 --> 00:22:26.878

00:22:26.945 --> 00:22:29.981
THERMAL FORM. IS AT AN

00:22:30.048 --> 00:22:31.750
OVERSIMPLIFICATION OF WHAT.

00:22:31.817 --> 00:22:34.820
WHERE WE'RE AT. AN ACCOMPLICE

00:22:34.886 --> 00:22:36.488
HATED PROCESS BUT OBVIOUSLY WE

00:22:36.555 --> 00:22:38.190
ARE TRYING TO DRIVE DEMAND BY

00:22:38.256 --> 00:22:40.225
HAVING AND MINIMUM RECYCLED

00:22:40.292 --> 00:22:42.694
CONTENT REQUIREMENT AND IT AND

00:22:42.761 --> 00:22:43.528
IT'S VERY SIMILAR TO WHAT WE

00:22:43.595 --> 00:22:48.300
DID WITH THE- WITH THE BILL FOR

00:22:48.366 --> 00:22:50.035
SEVENTY EIGHT BY I MEAN AND THE

00:22:50.102 --> 00:22:51.536
CLASSICS BILL FROM LAST YEAR

00:22:51.603 --> 00:22:54.106
BUT THE NINETY THREE. NINETY

00:22:54.172 --> 00:22:55.741
THREE BY THE FAR YOU'RE REALLY

00:22:55.807 --> 00:22:57.442
DRIVING YOUR DRIVING DEMAND

00:22:57.509 --> 00:23:00.512
PREFERRED IF I RECALL THE- THE

00:23:00.579 --> 00:23:02.881
BOTTLE BUILD BUG FAXES PLASTIC

00:23:02.948 --> 00:23:04.983
WE REQUIRED A MINIMUM CONTENT

00:23:05.050 --> 00:23:05.984
BUT WE DIDN'T SAY IT COULD NOT

00:23:06.051 --> 00:23:09.521
BE. THERMAL FORM PLASTIC- SORT

00:23:09.588 --> 00:23:13.959
OF- WHAT TO YOU PICK WITH US

00:23:14.025 --> 00:23:16.128
ANY SEE ANY ANY APPROPRIATE

00:23:16.194 --> 00:23:17.996
PLASTIC THAT WAS RECYCLED SO

00:23:18.063 --> 00:23:19.598
IT'S THEM I MEAN I LOOK FORWARD

00:23:19.664 --> 00:23:21.266
I'M GOING TO SUPPORTING THE

00:23:21.333 --> 00:23:23.769
MEASURE BUT IT'S AS THE

00:23:23.835 --> 00:23:26.638
MARKET'S MATURE AND YOU HAVE

00:23:26.705 --> 00:23:29.407
THIS SEGREGATION- OF THE

00:23:29.474 --> 00:23:30.475
DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTIC

00:23:30.542 --> 00:23:31.810
OBVIOUSLY THE ONE HAVE

00:23:31.877 --> 00:23:33.178
DIFFERENT TARGETS FOR DIFFERENT

00:23:33.245 --> 00:23:36.548
DIFFERENT TYPES OF YOU SO- LOOK

00:23:36.615 --> 00:23:37.849
FOR TO CONTENTION TO IT AND FOR

00:23:37.916 --> 00:23:39.317
THAT FOR THE BOTTLES YOU DO

00:23:39.384 --> 00:23:41.319
NEED TO USE THAT THAT SPECIFIC

00:23:41.386 --> 00:23:43.321
TYPE OF PLASTIC AND THAT'S HOW

00:23:43.388 --> 00:23:45.090
YOU CREATE THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY

00:23:45.157 --> 00:23:46.725
FOR THE THERMA FORMS. YOU CAN

00:23:46.792 --> 00:23:47.926
ALSO USE THE BOOK THEY THEY

00:23:47.993 --> 00:23:49.361
HAVE BEEN USING THE BOTTLES BUT

00:23:49.427 --> 00:23:51.029
THAT WOULD BE THAT WOULD MAKE

00:23:51.096 --> 00:23:52.898
THEM MARKET FOR BOTTLES MORE

00:23:52.964 --> 00:23:53.799
DIFFICULT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

00:23:53.865 --> 00:23:55.267
REALLY TRYING TO GET THE

00:23:55.333 --> 00:23:57.469
CIRCULAR ECONOMY WITH- THE JUST

00:23:57.536 --> 00:23:59.371
THE THERMAL FORMS BUT ALSO

00:23:59.437 --> 00:24:00.806
SINCE WE'RE DOING A GOOD JOB OF

00:24:00.872 --> 00:24:02.374
RECYCLING POTOM TO LEAVE THAT

00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.344
THAT'S NOT TODAY'S. DISCUSSIONS

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:10.515
WILL HAVE THAT LATER. ALL

00:24:10.582 --> 00:24:13.952
RIGHT. YES SENATE SKINNER. I

00:24:14.019 --> 00:24:15.487
WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS FOR

BRING THE BILL- YOU KNOW

00:24:17.756 --> 00:24:19.558
THERE'S A- I THINK MOST

00:24:19.624 --> 00:24:21.426
CALIFORNIANS ARE SOPHISTICATED

00:24:21.493 --> 00:24:22.661
ENOUGH TO KNOW. THAT JUST

00:24:22.727 --> 00:24:23.929
PUTTING SOMETHING IN A

00:24:23.995 --> 00:24:25.997
RECYCLING BIN IS NOT RECYCLING.

00:24:26.064 --> 00:24:29.301
AND THAT UNLESS THE PRODUCT. IS

00:24:29.367 --> 00:24:31.703
RE MANUFACTURED. MEANING UNLESS

00:24:31.770 --> 00:24:34.272
THE PRODUCT IS TAKEN AND THEN

00:24:34.339 --> 00:24:36.208
HOWEVER TRANSFORM TO BE RE

00:24:36.274 --> 00:24:37.609
MANUFACTURED INTO ANOTHER

00:24:37.676 --> 00:24:39.644
PRODUCT THERE IS NO RECYCLING.

00:24:39.711 --> 00:24:42.848
AND SO. THIS WILL HELP US

00:24:42.914 --> 00:24:44.649
ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS AND

00:24:44.716 --> 00:24:46.184
PLASTICS OF COURSE HAVE BEEN

00:24:46.251 --> 00:24:47.953
ONE OF THE MOST OF THEIR

00:24:48.019 --> 00:24:49.888
UBIQUITOUS NOW THEY'RE ONE OF

00:24:49.955 --> 00:24:52.157
THE MOST DIFFICULT BECAUSE OF

00:24:52.224 --> 00:24:54.359
THE- WE'VE NOT HAD ADEQUATE

00:24:54.426 --> 00:24:56.361
RULES. ON WHAT THE CONTENT OF

00:24:56.428 --> 00:24:58.430
THE PLASTIC IS THE CAN MADE UP

00:24:58.496 --> 00:25:00.165
OF SO MANY DIFFERENT POLYMERS

00:25:00.232 --> 00:25:02.234
THAT IT'S OFTEN TIMES IN MOST

00:25:02.300 --> 00:25:04.603
IMPOSSIBLE TO THEN TAKE THAT

00:25:04.669 --> 00:25:06.972

00:25:12.244 --> 00:25:14.179
SYMBOL ON THE PARTICULAR

00:25:14.246 --> 00:25:16.481
PACKAGE DOES NOT ALSO INDICATE

00:25:16.548 --> 00:25:18.350
THAT IT'S REALLY YOU KNOW MAYBE

00:25:18.416 --> 00:25:19.951
THEORETICALLY IT MIGHT BE

00:25:20.018 --> 00:25:21.786
RECYCLABLE BUT IT HAVE ANYTHING

00:25:21.853 --> 00:25:23.989
TO DO WITH THE ACTUAL. RE USE

00:25:24.055 --> 00:25:26.892
OF THAT MATERIAL SO I THINK

00:25:26.958 --> 00:25:31.696
THIS WILL HELP US GET THERE I.

00:25:31.763 --> 00:25:32.764
ACTUALLY I THINK THAT- IF WE

00:25:32.831 --> 00:25:34.432

00:25:40.105 --> 00:25:43.008
FIRST AND FOREMOST GOAL. BUT IN

THE LANGUAGE OF THE BOTTOM OF

TAKING I WILL SAY- YOU KNOW I

01:02:03.953 --> 01:02:04.520
KNOW THE CASE A COUPLE IT'S FOR

01:02:04.587 --> 01:02:08.624
EXAMPLE. IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:09.258
TO HAVE A COUPLE IT WHEN YOU'RE

01:02:09.325 --> 01:02:11.661
ON THE GO. GET YOUR CAR WITH

01:02:11.727 --> 01:02:14.597
HOT COFFEE. HOWEVER I WILL SAY

01:02:14.664 --> 01:02:16.532
THERE A LOT OF SITUATIONS WHERE

01:02:16.599 --> 01:02:18.668
PEOPLE ARE FOR SOME REASON

01:02:18.734 --> 01:02:19.836

JUST GOING AND TO TABLE AT THE

01:02:29.212 --> 01:02:30.179
SHOP IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:32.448
COUPLE IS KIND OF SILLY AND

01:02:32.515 --> 01:02:34.984
WASTEFUL BUT- YEAH I UNDERSTAND

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:38.221
THAT- IT'S HARD TO WRITE THIS

01:02:38.287 --> 01:02:39.722
IN A WAY THAT- CAN

01:02:39.789 --> 01:02:40.990
DIFFERENTIATE IT WOULD

01:02:41.057 --> 01:02:43.259
CERTAINLY BE MY PREFERENCE FOR

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.193
THEM THOSE KINDS OF SITUATIONS

01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:46.262
FOR- FOR THE FOR THE BILL TO

01:02:46.329 --> 01:02:48.631
APPLY- BUT- I UNDERSTAND I'M

01:02:48.698 --> 01:02:50.500
NOT. I'M I'M NOT CERTAINLY NOT

01:02:50.566 --> 01:02:51.300
GOING TO FORCE THAT ON TO THE

01:02:51.367 --> 01:02:53.603

THAT'S MENTIONED ANALYSIS ON

01:02:56.372 --> 01:03:00.009
PAGE NINE. IN SECTION FIVE. I

01:03:00.076 --> 01:03:00.543
WHICH HAS TO DO WITH THE

01:03:00.610 --> 01:03:02.111
PENALTY IN THE EXTENT TO WHICH

01:03:02.178 --> 01:03:04.514

AND THE OTHER WAS MENTIONING

01:03:09.752 --> 01:03:11.454
THAT THIS IS IN LINE WITH THE-

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.955
PERSONALITY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:03:13.022 --> 01:03:16.325

DECEMBER CALDERON RAN A FEW

01:03:22.031 --> 01:03:25.234
YEARS AGO- BUT IT DOES CONTINUE

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.769
TO BE A CONCERN OF MINE THAT-

01:03:26.836 --> 01:03:33.276
WE ENSURE THAT. THAT- THERE'S

01:03:33.342 --> 01:03:35.578

CONSIDER AS THIS BILL MOVES

01:03:39.916 --> 01:03:41.851
ALONG. THOSE ARE THE THOSE ARE

01:03:41.918 --> 01:03:42.652
THE AYE THOSE ARE THE ISSUES

01:03:42.718 --> 01:03:43.886
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE

01:03:43.953 --> 01:03:44.787
REMEMBER THAT SHE HAS

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.522
UNEQUIVOCALLY ACCEPTED ARE THE-

01:03:46.589 --> 01:03:49.358
ONES IN BOLD. ON PAGE NINE TEN.

01:03:49.425 --> 01:03:51.160
MINUTES AUTHORS ACCEPTED AND I

01:03:51.227 --> 01:03:52.695
JUST- I'VE COUPLE COMMENTS SO

01:03:52.762 --> 01:03:55.631
TO MAKE BUT I AM INTERESTED-

01:03:55.698 --> 01:03:58.901
WAS THE REMOVAL OF THE HIGHER.

01:03:58.968 --> 01:04:00.603
IN NINETEEN. THE REMOVAL OF THE

01:04:00.670 --> 01:04:02.572
HIGHER FINE. IT SAYS IN THE

01:04:02.638 --> 01:04:04.240
ANALYSIS THE BILL REGIONALLY

01:04:04.307 --> 01:04:06.209
HAD A ONE HUNDRED DOLLAR PER

01:04:06.275 --> 01:04:07.944
DAY FINE WITH A MAXIMUM PENALTY

01:04:08.010 --> 01:04:11.514
OF THOUSAND- DID YOU REMOVE

01:04:11.581 --> 01:04:14.283
THAT YOURSELF OR DID WAS THAT

01:04:14.350 --> 01:04:14.850
REQUIRED IN THE COMMITTEE IN

01:04:14.917 --> 01:04:17.019
THE ASSEMBLY. I REMOVE THAT

01:04:17.086 --> 01:04:18.554
MYSELF I BELIEVE THERE'S A

01:04:18.621 --> 01:04:19.789
COUPLE OF THINGS THAT I WANT TO

01:04:19.855 --> 01:04:20.756
ADDRESS WHEN IT COMES TO THE

01:04:20.823 --> 01:04:22.758
FEES ONE THE TWENTY FIVE DOLLAR

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:25.928
FEE LINE. FINE YES THE TWENTY

01:04:25.995 --> 01:04:27.530
FIVE DOLLAR FINE IS IN

01:04:27.597 --> 01:04:29.298
ALIGNMENT WITH LEGISLATION

01:04:29.365 --> 01:04:31.100
ALREADY PASSED THAT EXPANDS

01:04:31.167 --> 01:04:32.401
THAT IS PART OF THE EXPANSION

01:04:32.468 --> 01:04:34.170
OF THIS BILL WHICH IS THE

01:04:34.237 --> 01:04:37.373
STRAW- LEGISLATION AUTHORED BY

01:04:37.440 --> 01:04:38.774
FORMER MAJORITY LEADER ASSEMBLY

01:04:38.841 --> 01:04:42.044
MEMBER CALDERON- IN ADDITION TO

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:44.080
I ALSO WANT TO MAKE THE PROCESS

01:04:44.146 --> 01:04:45.848
IN WHICH THESE FINES AND-

01:04:45.915 --> 01:04:47.617
INSPECTIONS OCCUR TO BE

01:04:47.683 --> 01:04:49.385
SEAMLESS. SO IF YOU ARE AN

01:04:49.452 --> 01:04:50.486
INSPECTOR GOING INTO A

01:04:50.553 --> 01:04:52.455
RESTAURANT AND YOU ARE SEEN

01:04:52.521 --> 01:04:53.089
THAT STROSS ARE BEING

01:04:53.155 --> 01:04:55.558
DISTRIBUTED- IT SHOULD BE IN

01:04:55.625 --> 01:04:57.627
ALIGNMENT THERE'S A DIFFERENCE

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:59.262
BETWEEN A STRONG ENOUGH WORK.

01:04:59.328 --> 01:05:00.696
THERE'S NO REASON WHY WE WILL

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:02.632
CHARGE A RESTAURANT MORE FOR A

01:05:02.698 --> 01:05:05.101
FOR A FORK R A KNIFE OR SPOON

01:05:05.167 --> 01:05:07.403
VERSUS A STRAW I ALSO WANT TO

01:05:07.470 --> 01:05:08.571
BE VERY CONSCIENTIOUS THAT WE

01:05:08.638 --> 01:05:11.274
ARE. IN A RECOVERY MODE OF

01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.276
FOLLOWING A GLOBAL PANDEMIC IN

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.644
WHICH ARE SMALL BUSINESSES AND

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:15.578
SMALL RESTAURANTS MOM AND POP

01:05:15.645 --> 01:05:17.246
SHOPS ARE SIMPLY TRYING TO

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:19.181
RECOVER. SO LET'S DO THIS THE

01:05:19.248 --> 01:05:20.950
WAY IT IS NOW LET'S TEST IT

01:05:21.017 --> 01:05:22.084
LET'S SEE HOW IT WORKS AND IF

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:23.786
WE NEED TO COME BACK AND SEE

01:05:23.853 --> 01:05:25.655
THAT THE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY THE

01:05:25.721 --> 01:05:27.223
LAW IS NOT BEING FOLLOWED THEN

01:05:27.290 --> 01:05:28.224
WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO

01:05:28.291 --> 01:05:29.992
THAT. BUT I WANT TO ENSURE THAT

01:05:30.059 --> 01:05:31.427
WE ARE MOVING FORWARD A PIECE

01:05:31.494 --> 01:05:33.229
OF LEGISLATION THAT IS CLIMATE

01:05:33.296 --> 01:05:34.730
ORIENTED THAT IS ENVIRONMENT

01:05:34.797 --> 01:05:37.433
ORIENTED WHILE AT THE SAME TIME

01:05:37.500 --> 01:05:39.068
ALLOWING SMALL BUSINESSES TO BE

01:05:39.135 --> 01:05:42.938
ABLE TO ONE RECOVER AND TO PUT

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:44.674
THIS PRACTICE AND TO PLACE- I

01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:47.443
SURE SIMILAR CONCERNS TO THE-

01:05:47.510 --> 01:05:50.379
CHAIR. REGARDING IMPACT OF THE

01:05:50.446 --> 01:05:53.149
PARTICULAR FINE- BUT-

01:05:53.215 --> 01:05:55.084
APPRECIATE YOUR EXPLANATION

01:05:55.151 --> 01:05:58.187
AND- WE PRICE SHOULDN'T BETTER

01:05:58.254 --> 01:05:59.889
ON STRAWS BUT WHATEVER BUT I

01:05:59.955 --> 01:06:01.924
MEAN THIS IS THE KIND OF THING

01:06:01.991 --> 01:06:04.327
WHERE WERE OBVIOUSLY. WE ARE

01:06:04.393 --> 01:06:06.962
HOPING THAT NOT ONLY SMALL

01:06:07.029 --> 01:06:08.197
BUSINESSES RESTAURANTS BUT ALSO

01:06:08.264 --> 01:06:10.866
THE PUBLIC. THROUGH LEGISLATION

01:06:10.933 --> 01:06:12.401
LIKE THIS TAKES THE AWARENESS

01:06:12.468 --> 01:06:16.972
TO- YOU KNOW NOT ALWAYS USE THE

01:06:17.039 --> 01:06:19.442
SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE PRODUCTS

01:06:19.508 --> 01:06:22.812
I HAVE TO- I APPRECIATE THIS

01:06:22.878 --> 01:06:24.280
LEGISLATION BECAUSE DURING THIS

01:06:24.347 --> 01:06:26.482
PANDEMIC IT HAS BEEN EXTREMELY

01:06:26.549 --> 01:06:28.918
FRUSTRATING TO ME THAT. WHEN I

01:06:28.984 --> 01:06:31.153
DID ORDER TO GO EVEN WHEN I

01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:33.456
EXPLICITLY INDICATED SINCE I

01:06:33.522 --> 01:06:34.824
WAS GOING TO EAT THE FOOD AT MY

01:06:34.890 --> 01:06:36.859
HOME THAT I DIDN'T NEED ANY OF

01:06:36.926 --> 01:06:38.594
THE FIGHT THOSE ITEMS I DIDN'T

01:06:38.661 --> 01:06:40.029
NEED THE NAPKINS I DIDN'T NEED

01:06:40.096 --> 01:06:41.497
ANY OF THE CUTLERY I WOULD GET

01:06:41.564 --> 01:06:44.400
IT ANYWAY. AND OF COURSE RIGHT

01:06:44.467 --> 01:06:45.234
HERE IN THIS BUILDING EVERY

01:06:45.301 --> 01:06:47.570
TIME WERE SERVED LUNCH WE ARE

01:06:47.636 --> 01:06:50.172
GIVEN THESE DISPOSABLE PACKAGES

01:06:50.239 --> 01:06:51.941
OF DISPOSABLE CUTLERY NOW

01:06:52.007 --> 01:06:54.577
IRONICALLY WHEN I WAS TALKING

GROUND WASTE BUT THERE'S VERY

01:07:23.406 --> 01:07:25.674
SERIOUS IMPLICATIONS AS THE

SOILS QUITE FRANKLY. BUT WHEN

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.912
IT COMES TO BIOMASS IN LIKE

01:25:24.052 --> 01:25:26.488
MAKE ENERGY OUT OF THOSE- BUT

01:25:26.554 --> 01:25:28.289
WHEN WE LOOKED AT. WHAT THE

LIKE COMBUSTION THEY DON'T LIKE

01:25:42.871 --> 01:25:44.939
BURNING OF ANYTHING AND SO. I

01:25:45.006 --> 01:25:46.474

01:25:52.146 --> 01:25:54.182
ENERGY. THERE'S A IT'S A LOT

01:25:54.249 --> 01:25:55.583
BETTER BENEFITS IN HAVING IT

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:58.520
BURNT OPEN OR EVEN COMPOST OPEN

01:25:58.586 --> 01:25:59.120
BECAUSE YOU HAVE NOTHING THAT

01:25:59.187 --> 01:26:01.055
COMES OUT. IN COMPANIES AND BY

01:26:01.122 --> 01:26:03.691
THE WAY THERE'S A BY PRODUCT

01:26:03.758 --> 01:26:06.561
TWO COMES OUT- BIO CHAR OR ASH

01:26:06.628 --> 01:26:08.329
WHICH IS VERY. GOOD FOR THE

01:26:08.396 --> 01:26:10.665
SOILS AS WELL. SO IT GOES FULL

01:26:10.732 --> 01:26:12.500
CIRCLE FIVE JUST WANT TO SHARE

01:26:12.567 --> 01:26:14.002
THAT THE DETAILS MATTER AND HOW

01:26:14.068 --> 01:26:16.871
WE GET TO THE POINT WORK- THIS

01:26:16.938 --> 01:26:17.906
REPORT COMES BACK WE ACTUALLY

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.874

THAT ACTUALLY BURN IT IN A

01:26:39.460 --> 01:26:41.496
CONTROLLED ENVIRONMENT AND MAKE

SEQUEL EXEMPTION GRAVY TRAIN

EVERY TIME A BILL COMES UP HERE

01:36:51.939 --> 01:36:55.309
BUT GIVEN THE CONCERNS HERE AND

01:36:55.376 --> 01:36:56.644
THAT AND THAT THE HEALTH

01:36:56.710 --> 01:36:58.646
EFFECTS I THINK IT'S A- IT'S A

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:00.948
GOOD MEASUREMENT HOPE IT. I

CO AUTHOR AND I AM VERY PLEASED

01:37:17.164 --> 01:37:20.301
TO SEE THAT AT LEAST ON THEIR-

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:22.303
DOESN'T APPEAR TO BE MAY MAYBE

01:37:22.369 --> 01:37:24.238

CREATE THIS PROGRAM IN THE

01:37:28.609 --> 01:37:30.444
FIRST PLACE IT TOOK ME A NUMBER

01:37:30.511 --> 01:37:31.645
OF YEARS WITH A VERY

01:37:31.712 --> 01:37:34.315
SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION I THINK

01:37:34.381 --> 01:37:36.684
THAT AS THE TESTIMONY WE HEARD.

01:37:36.750 --> 01:37:39.119
NOT ONLY IS THIS VERY ESSENTIAL

01:37:39.186 --> 01:37:42.890
FOR PUBLIC HEALTH BECAUSE THE-

01:37:42.957 --> 01:37:45.526
THE BLOOD BORNE DISEASES THAT

01:37:45.593 --> 01:37:48.128
MEANS SADLY WE- I'VE SEEN IN A

01:37:48.195 --> 01:37:50.130
NUMBER OF OUR ENCAMPMENTS-

01:37:50.197 --> 01:37:53.901
SEVERE OUTBREAKS OF THE HELP-

01:37:53.968 --> 01:37:56.170
VIRUSES THAT UNFORTUNATELY CAN

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:58.372
BE SPREAD. THROUGH CONTAMINATED

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.808
SYRINGES AND THIS GREATLY

01:38:00.874 --> 01:38:03.277
REDUCES THOSE OUTBREAKS AND OF

01:38:03.344 --> 01:38:05.546
COURSE REDUCES THE WASTE NONE

01:38:05.613 --> 01:38:08.048
OF US WANT TO SEE- RENDON A

01:38:08.115 --> 01:38:10.217
PARKER IT YOU KNOW WHEREVER ON

01:38:10.284 --> 01:38:11.151
THE STREET AND SEE THESE

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.920
DISCARDED SYRINGES SO I'M

01:38:12.987 --> 01:38:15.089
REALLY GLAD YOU BROUGHT IT. AND

01:38:15.155 --> 01:38:18.359
HAPPY TO- IF YOU'RE WILLING TO

01:38:18.425 --> 01:38:20.894
BE A CO AUTHOR PRECIADO. THE

01:38:20.961 --> 01:38:22.429
SENATE THIRTY DOLLARS. WELL I

01:38:22.496 --> 01:38:24.231
GUESS I'M GONNA BE THE ONLY GUY

01:38:24.298 --> 01:38:29.270
THAT- FIRST OF ALL I KNOW IS

01:38:29.336 --> 01:38:30.371
STANDING UP FOR SECRET BRAND

01:38:30.437 --> 01:38:32.640
IT'S GOOD I KNOW AND I WANT TO.

01:38:32.706 --> 01:38:33.841
THIS IS REALLY BETWEEN AWKWARD

01:38:33.907 --> 01:38:35.242
SPOT BECAUSE I USUALLY VOTE FOR

01:38:35.309 --> 01:38:37.344
SEQUEL EXEMPTIONS BUT THERE IT

01:38:37.411 --> 01:38:38.946
FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO JUST.

01:38:39.013 --> 01:38:40.014
TAKE A MINUTE MISTER CHECK

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:42.449
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WE NEED TO

01:38:42.516 --> 01:38:42.950
GET OUT HERE BUT THIS IS

01:38:43.017 --> 01:38:44.685
SOMETHING I'M PASSIONATE ABOUT.

01:38:44.752 --> 01:38:46.654
SHE WAS A GOOD LAW. THE REASON

01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:48.756
THAT WE HAVE SEEK WAS THAT. IF

01:38:48.822 --> 01:38:51.759
YOU HAVE IMPACTS THAT'S WHY YOU

01:38:51.825 --> 01:38:52.326
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO MITIGATE

01:38:52.393 --> 01:38:54.762
THOSE IMPACTS. N. C. WAS BEEN

01:38:54.828 --> 01:38:56.196
USED FOR ALL KINDS OF

01:38:56.263 --> 01:38:59.933
MANIPULATION WHETHER IT'S- THE

01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.769
ONE GRAVEL MINING COMPANY

01:39:01.835 --> 01:39:03.337
SEQUENT ANOTHER GRAVEL MINING

01:39:03.404 --> 01:39:04.738
COMPANY TO BUSINESSES BECAUSE

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.940
THEY DON'T WANT TO COMPETITION

01:39:07.007 --> 01:39:07.541
WHETHER IT'S LABOR AGREEMENTS

01:39:07.608 --> 01:39:09.243
WHETHER IT'S- PUTTING UP AN

01:39:09.310 --> 01:39:11.278
ARENA WE WE'VE SEEN ALL KINDS

01:39:11.345 --> 01:39:12.613
OF ABUSES OF SEQUEL BUT SEQUEL

01:39:12.680 --> 01:39:14.081
ACTUALLY IS A REALLY GOOD LAW.

01:39:14.148 --> 01:39:15.516
AND THE REASON WE HAVE SEQUENCE

01:39:15.582 --> 01:39:17.051
SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE SO THAT

01:39:17.117 --> 01:39:19.953
WE MAY MITIGATE IMPACTS. I'VE

01:39:20.020 --> 01:39:21.088
DON'T REPRESENT ANYMORE BUT I

01:39:21.155 --> 01:39:22.990
USED TO REPRESENT YOU COUNTY

01:39:23.057 --> 01:39:25.125
WHERE THE LAWSUIT CAME FROM IS

01:39:25.192 --> 01:39:27.161
ONE OF THE LAWSUITS. WHERE YOU

01:39:27.227 --> 01:39:29.797
HAVE A DISPENSARY AND A

01:39:29.863 --> 01:39:30.531
COLLECTION BUT IT UNFORTUNATELY

01:39:30.597 --> 01:39:32.099
THEY- DID OR NOT ALL GETTING

01:39:32.166 --> 01:39:34.168
COLLECTED VERY FACT VERY FEW OF

01:39:34.234 --> 01:39:34.735
THEM ARE GETTING COLLECTED A

01:39:34.802 --> 01:39:36.070
LOT OF THEM BEING DISPERSED.

01:39:36.136 --> 01:39:37.371
AND IT IN A SAFE ZONE BUT THERE

01:39:37.438 --> 01:39:39.039
ARE GETTING CORRECTED AND SO

01:39:39.106 --> 01:39:40.974
WHAT WE HAVE WE HAVE. A PROBLEM

01:39:41.041 --> 01:39:43.010
YOU CAN IF THERE'S A- NEEDLE

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:44.078
THIS BEEN USED YOU CAN GET

01:39:44.144 --> 01:39:45.312
HEPATITIS FROM THAT NEED TO

01:39:45.379 --> 01:39:46.647
LIVE IT'S- NOT BEEN RECYCLED

01:39:46.714 --> 01:39:48.982
PROPERLY. THAT'S WHY THERE'S

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:50.517
LAWSUIT AND SO FOR ME WE'RE

01:39:50.584 --> 01:39:52.086
GONNA JUST CARVED THIS OUT NOW

01:39:52.152 --> 01:39:54.221
AND WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA SAY

01:39:54.288 --> 01:39:54.788
YOU DON'T HAVE TO GO THROUGH

01:39:54.855 --> 01:39:56.323
THE PROCESS OF SEEK WERE. AND

01:39:56.390 --> 01:39:57.458
THEN THERE'S A REAL GOOD REASON

01:39:57.524 --> 01:39:58.992
THAT WE HAVE SEQUENCE BECAUSE

01:39:59.059 --> 01:40:01.161
THERE ARE CONFLICTS HERE. SO

01:40:01.228 --> 01:40:03.397
FOR ME IT'S LIKE I'D LOOK I

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:05.299
WANT TO RECYCLE ALL THE STUFF

01:40:05.366 --> 01:40:06.800
THAT NEED TO BE SO I WANT TO

01:40:06.867 --> 01:40:07.368
PUT IT THE RIGHT WAY STREAM.

01:40:07.434 --> 01:40:10.170
BUT THE LAW FOR SEQUEL IS GOOD

01:40:10.237 --> 01:40:12.172
IN THIS CASE IT'S- WAY TO

01:40:12.239 --> 01:40:13.574
MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTS AND WHEN

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:15.109
THEY DON'T GET MITIGATED. WE GO

01:40:15.175 --> 01:40:18.145
TO COURT. AND SO I CAN'T

01:40:18.212 --> 01:40:20.381
SUPPORT THIS BECAUSE THERE'S N.

01:40:20.447 --> 01:40:23.117
STREET IN CHICO. THEY WERE GET

01:40:23.183 --> 01:40:24.918
THERE'S THE PARK WAS FILLED

01:40:24.985 --> 01:40:27.654
WITH WHERE KIDS ARE GOING TO

01:40:27.721 --> 01:40:30.491
PLAY WITH USED NEEDLES. THAT'S

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:31.959
IMPACTED I DON'T WANT MY CHILD

01:40:32.025 --> 01:40:33.227
TO HAVE TO FACE AND THATS WHY

01:40:33.293 --> 01:40:34.228
WE HAVE SECRET SO THAT YOU

01:40:34.294 --> 01:40:35.896
MITIGATE THOSE IMPACTED OR NOT

01:40:35.963 --> 01:40:37.631
PUT IN PLACES WHERE THEY

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:40.567
SHOULDN'T BE. SO I HAVE I VOTED

01:40:40.634 --> 01:40:41.835
FOR A LOT OF SECRET EXAMS

01:40:41.902 --> 01:40:43.537
BECAUSE I THINK TO SEEK WAS

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:45.272
BEEN EXAMPLE IN THIS CASE. WE

01:40:45.339 --> 01:40:46.073
GOT TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND

01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:47.241
MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS BEEN

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:51.745
MITIGATED. SO FOR THOSE REASONS

01:40:51.812 --> 01:40:52.346
I'M NOT REAL SUPPORT YOUR BILL

01:40:52.413 --> 01:40:55.015
TODAY AND I. UNFORTUNATELY

01:40:55.082 --> 01:40:56.250
IT'LL BE THE FIRST SECRET

01:40:56.316 --> 01:40:57.050
EXEMPTION BILL IF VOTED

01:40:57.117 --> 01:40:59.653
AGAINST. BECAUSE I LIKE TO I

01:40:59.720 --> 01:41:01.054
THINK WE NEED TO DO SOME WORK

01:41:01.121 --> 01:41:02.723
ON C. QUITE REALLY DO IT NEEDS

01:41:02.790 --> 01:41:06.493
TO BE. FAIR AND IT'S NOT AND

01:41:06.560 --> 01:41:07.861
IT'S UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE IT'S

01:41:07.928 --> 01:41:10.097
USED IN SO MANY SITUATIONS TO

01:41:10.164 --> 01:41:11.098
LEVERAGE SOMEBODY ELSE TO GET

01:41:11.165 --> 01:41:16.103
SOMETHING. WE ARE VERY VERY

01:41:16.170 --> 01:41:17.704
PUBLIC IN SAYING THAT READ THE

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:20.140
ORIGINAL SEQUEL LAW WAS MEANT

01:41:20.207 --> 01:41:21.375
FOR IT WAS. A GOOD IT WAS GOOD

01:41:21.442 --> 01:41:23.143
LAW. BUT IT'S BEEN USED IN SO

01:41:23.210 --> 01:41:25.179
MANY BAD WAYS IN AND WE DISCUSS

01:41:25.245 --> 01:41:25.913
DIFFERENT THAT I MEAN I DON'T

01:41:25.979 --> 01:41:27.948
THINK THE- CHAIRMAN MAYBE IS

01:41:28.015 --> 01:41:29.216
VOTED FOR IN THE SECRET

01:41:29.283 --> 01:41:31.351
EXEMPTIONS IS THAT. IN THE PAST

01:41:31.418 --> 01:41:33.987
MAYBE FEW BUT- SO FOR THOSE

01:41:34.054 --> 01:41:34.555
REASONS I CAN'T SUPPORT THE

01:41:34.621 --> 01:41:36.824
BILL TODAY. BUT I HAVE I HAVE I

01:41:36.890 --> 01:41:37.991
GUESS I WOULD JUST POINT A

01:41:38.058 --> 01:41:38.792
COUPLE THINGS FIRST OF ALL

01:41:38.859 --> 01:41:42.996
THERE ARE THERE ARE- SEVERAL- A

01:41:43.063 --> 01:41:44.231
MITIGATION REQUIREMENTS THAT

01:41:44.298 --> 01:41:45.332
ARE. STILL REQUIRED INTO THIS

01:41:45.399 --> 01:41:46.700
BILL THEM THERE OUTLINED ON

01:41:46.767 --> 01:41:49.002
PAGE FOUR. INDICATES FIVE

01:41:49.069 --> 01:41:50.671
NOTICE PUBLIC FRUSTRATION. THE

01:41:50.737 --> 01:41:52.372
OTHER THING JUST TO MENTION. IS

01:41:52.439 --> 01:41:54.107
THAT NO PROJECT WILL MOVE FOR

01:41:54.174 --> 01:41:55.542
THE SPELL WITHOUT THE FULL.

01:41:55.609 --> 01:41:57.578
COOPERATION OF THE LOCAL

01:41:57.644 --> 01:42:00.814
JURISDICTION. I'M AND YOU KNOW

01:42:00.881 --> 01:42:02.583
WE ALL KNOW. THAT CITY COUNCILS

01:42:02.649 --> 01:42:04.384
A VERY. INTERESTING PUBLIC

01:42:04.451 --> 01:42:05.652
COMMENT AND GIVE FOLKS SOME

01:42:05.719 --> 01:42:07.154
COMMON. RAISE WHATEVER CONCERNS

THEY HAVE THEIR- IN ADDITION TO

01:42:08.789 --> 01:42:10.891
THE- TO THE TO THE PUBLIC

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.593
INPUT. THAT WE'VE PUT INTO THE

01:42:12.659 --> 01:42:14.027
BILL THAT THAT ARE IN THE BILL.

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:14.561
THE OTHER THING I SHOULD

01:42:14.628 --> 01:42:16.096
MENTION IS THAT. YOU UP SEE

01:42:16.163 --> 01:42:18.432
RIGHT. THERE THERE'S A THERE'S

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:20.367

COMMENTS. ASIF SITE THAT IS

01:42:26.940 --> 01:42:28.242
ACTUALLY PROPERLY MANAGED IS

01:42:28.308 --> 01:42:30.010
ACTUALLY FAR LESS LIKELY TO

01:42:30.077 --> 01:42:33.180
RESULT IN. DANGEROUS I NEED A

01:42:33.247 --> 01:42:34.715

IS WHAT WE HAVE OUT ON OUR

01:42:38.685 --> 01:42:43.590
STREETS RIGHT NOW SO. THAT'S

01:42:43.657 --> 01:42:44.291
WHY I'M SUPPORTING THE BILL- I

WHERE EVEN THIS WAS EVEN A

01:42:54.535 --> 01:42:57.204
THING RIGHT I MEAN HOW TERRIBLE

01:42:57.271 --> 01:42:57.804
IS IT THAT WE'RE SITTING HERE

01:42:57.871 --> 01:42:59.706
HAVING TO- FIGURE OUT HOW TO

01:42:59.773 --> 01:43:02.009
ACCOMMODATE. AND THE REALITY OF
