WELCOME MEMBERS TO OUR VERY FIRST INFORMATIONAL HEARING OF THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. TODAY WE WILL BEGIN LOOKING AT OUR EFFORTS TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE THE EMISSIONS FROM MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. AS WELL AS OFF ROAD VEHICLES. THESE VEHICLES PLAY A VERY CRUCIAL ROLE AND I'VE HEARD FROM MANY MEMBERS ON THEIR STANCE ON. ON ON WHAT LIKE THEY'D LIKE TO SEE BUT THE MID DISPROPORTIONATE AMOUNTS OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND OTHER TOXIC POLLUTANTS SO WE MUST ACT NOW. AND BECAUSE OF WHERE THESE VEHICLES OPERATE THEY HAVE AN ESPECIALLY LARGE IMPACT AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO TODAY WE WILL LOOK AT OUR EFFORTS TO TRANSITION INTO MUCH CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES. WE'LL LOOK AT BOTH THE VEHICLES AND THE FUELING SUPPLY AND DISTRIBUTION CHAIN. AND I HOPE YOU GET A REALISTIC PICTURE OF WHAT WE CAN EXPECT AND WHEN WE CAN EXPECT IT. WILL BE SPENDING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYER MONEY IN CALIFORNIA. TO SUPPORT ITS CLEAN TECHNOLOGY TRANSITION. SO WE OWE IT TO OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS TO BE SURE WE'RE SPENDING THE MONEY EFFICIENTLY. RESPONSIBLY AND WITH EQUITY IN MIND. SO WITH THAT LET'S BEGIN OUR HEARING. WILL START WITH OUR CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD CHAIR LIANE RANDOLPH. A TO RANDOLPH THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES THE FLOOR'S YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- AND I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND THROUGH THE MAGIC AND SCREEN SHARING- I WILL SHARE- A VERY BRIEF- POWER POINT. THE. AS THE CHAIR NOTED THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR WHICH INCLUDES THE EMISSIONS FROM. SORRY HOMELAND I'M HIDING I THINK OKAY. IT'S PETITIONS WHICH INCLUDES EMISSIONS FROM BOTH VEHICLES DIRECTLY AS WELL AS FROM EXTRACTING REFINING AND TRANSPORTING THE FUEL IS NEEDED TO POWER THEM IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE THAN HALF OF CALIFORNIA'S GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. AND CONSTITUTES THE MAJORITY OF SMOG CAUSING POLLUTANTS AND IS A SIGNIFICANT SOURCE OF TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS THAT DIRECTLY IMPACT COMMUNITY HEALTH SPECIFICALLY THESE EMISSIONS CONTRIBUTE TO A WIDE RANGE OF HEART AND LUNG ILLNESSES CHRONIC HEALTH CONDITIONS INCREASED CANCER RATES AND PREMATURE DEATH. EVERY YEAR OVER FIVE THOUSAND PREMATURE DEATHS AND HUNDREDS OF ILLNESSES AND EMERGENCY ROOM VISITS FOR RESPIRATORY AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE IN CALIFORNIA ARE LINKED TO PM TWO POINT FIVE POLLUTION. OF WHICH MORE THAN HALF IS PRODUCED BY THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. RECENT RESEARCH DEMONSTRATES THAT FINE PARTICULATE POLLUTION IMPACTS NOT ONLY THE HEART AND RESPIRATORY SYSTEM BUT ALSO BRAIN HEALTH AND ADVERSE BIRTH OUTCOMES. ADDRESSING EMISSIONS FROM THIS SECTOR WILL BE PARAMOUNT IN ACHIEVING THE STATE'S AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE GOALS. WELL THE FOCUS OF THIS HEARING IS ON THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES I WANT TO BRIEFLY TOUCH ON LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES. AS THEY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE AND OFFER VALUABLE CONTEXT. IN CALIFORNIA THE LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR CONTRIBUTES A SIZEABLE PROPORTION OF CURRENT KNOCKS AND GHG EMISSIONS LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES CONTRIBUTE ABOUT 28% OF THE GHG EMISSIONS. REPRESENTING THE LARGEST SINGLE SOURCE OF COMEDY MISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR ABOUT 9% OF TOTAL KNOCKS AND MISSION STATEWIDE IN TWENTY NINETEEN. RBC CAN TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM THESE VEHICLES BY CLEANING UP CONVENTIONAL CARS AND ACCELERATING THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. WITH RESPECT TO CLEANER VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES CARB STAFF ARE CURRENTLY WORKING ON THE ADVANCE CLEAN CARS TO OUR WHAT WE CALL EASY TO PROGRAM THAT WILL TAKE US FOR MODEL YEAR TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. TIGHTENING STANDARDS WHERE NECESSARY AND PURSUING ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS THAT WILL TRANSLATE TO REAL WORLD EMISSION BENEFITS FROM INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES. ACC TWO IS ONE AMONG SEVERAL PROGRAMS ADDRESSING EMISSIONS FROM LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES OTHERSINCLUDE THE CLEAN MILE STANDARD THE SB THREE SEVENTY FIVE PROGRAM AS WELL AS A NUMBER OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT REDUCE THE HIGHER UP FRONT COST OF SAYS AND SUPPORT ALTERNATIVES TO OWNING A PERSONAL VEHICLE. AND WE MUST REDUCE DEPENDENCE ON DRIVING THROUGH MORE SUSTAINABLE COMMUNITIES THAT REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED. IT DOESN'T MATTER WHETHER YOU LIVE IN THE BAY AREA SEVEN CALIFORNIA FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY. ALL CALIFORNIANS NEED THEIR LEADERS TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES TO REDUCE VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED BECAUSE THE HEALTH OF OUR INDIVIDUAL COMMUNITIES DEPENDS ON IT. I WILL NOW TURN TO MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND THE ACTIONS CARPET IS TAKING TO CLEAN UP THE FLEET. TRUCKS MAKE UP ONLY 6% OF THE STATE'S VEHICLE POPULATION BUT THEY REPRESENT ALMOST A QUARTER OF THE STATE'S TRANSPORTATION GHG EMISSIONS. AND NEARLY HALF OF THE KNOX EMISSIONS. ADDRESSING THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT FROM TRACKS AND FREIGHT MOVEMENT IS CRITICAL TO MEETING OUR GOALS. THIS IS MY CHOSEN ANALYSIS CONDUCTED BY CAR TO ESTIMATE POTENTIAL CANCER RISK FROM DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS. OR DTM AS NOTED IN THE FIGURES. YOU'RE ON THE LEFT SHOWS RELATIVE CANCER RISK ACROSS THE STATE ON THE RIGHT WE HAVE HIGHLIGHTED NUMBER EIGHTY SIX ONE SEVEN COMMUNITIES TO SHOW THE DISPROPORTIONATE IMPACT DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS CAN HAVE IN AND AROUND THOSE COMMUNITIES. HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND OTHER EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRIAL PORT AND WAREHOUSE ACTIVITIES ARE A DOMINANT SOURCE FROM DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS IN MANY COMMUNITIES. WELL DIESEL PARTICULATE EMISSIONS ARE PROJECTED TO DECREASE BY 80% FROM TWENTY TWELVE TO TWENTY THIRTY AS A RESULT OF STATE AND LOCAL REGULATIONS AND INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THERE IS STILL MUCH WORK TO BE DONE TO REDUCE EXISTING BURDENS AND RISKS IN THESE COMMUNITIES. WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY OF REDUCING EMISSIONS FROM EXISTING TRACKS AND CONTINUE TO MAKE PROGRESS. THE TRUCK AND BUS REGULATION ADOPTED MORE THAN A DECADE AGO WILL REACH FULL IMPLEMENTATION AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO WE ARE NEARLY ALL HEAVY DUTY DIESEL TRUCKS WHEN THE TO HAVE CLEANER TWENTY TEN OR NEWER ENGINES. THE LEGISLATURE RECOGNIZED THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS REGULATION FOR AIR QUALITY THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF SB ONE BY SENATOR ABOUT. WHICH GAVE THE WORLD SHEET THAT CARD COULD NOT BY DISALLOWING NON COMPLIANT VEHICLES FROM REGISTERING WITH THE DMV. THIS SLIDE SHOWS REGULATIONS CARDS HAVE CARP HAS ADOPTED WELL WILL BE CONSIDERING FOR FUTURE ADOPTION. THE ITEMS CAPTURED ABOUT THE TIMELINE ARE ZERO EMISSION REGULATION. ZERO EMISSION AND ELECTRIC INCLUDE BOTH HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC AS WELL AS BATTERY ELECTRIC. ARE THERE REGULATIONS FIRST TARGETED BUS BUSES AND AIRPORT SHUTTLES AND HAVE SINCE EXPANDED TO TRUCKS WITH OUR ADVANCE CLEAN TRUCKS RULE. THAT RULE IS THE FIRST IN THE WORLD REGULATION THAT REQUIRES TRUCK MANUFACTURERS TO TRANSITION FROM DIESEL TRUCKS AND VANS TO ELECTRIC ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR FOLLOWED BY THE COMPLIMENTARY ADVANCE CLEAN FLEETS WERE ALL THAT WILL ENSURE. AN ENGINE TRUCK SALES CONSISTENT WITH GOVERNING NEWS AND ZERO EMISSIONS THANK YOU TO ORDER. ELIMINATING TAILPIPE EMISSIONS THROUGH ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY WILL REDUCE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS TOXICS AND GHG EMISSIONS SIMULTANEOUSLY. THIS HELPS US NOT ONLY ACHIEVE OUR ERRANT CLIMATE GOALS BUT IMPROVES PUBLIC HEALTH ESPECIALLY FOR THOSE PRIORITY COMMUNITIES MOST DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY POLLUTION. IN ADDITION TO OUR REGULATIONS WHICH ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY CARP ALSO FINDS DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS TO FOSTER INNOVATIVE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR AND FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ASSIST IN THE EARLY YEARS OF TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND MARKET INTRODUCTION. COMPLEMENTARY TO CARBS DURING MISSION EFFORTS IN THIS SPACE WE HAVE ALSO PUT IN PLACE MEASURES TO ENSURE THAT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINES OPERATE AS CLEANLY AS POSSIBLE. A FEW EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE HEAVY DUTY OMNIBUS REGULATION. AND THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR AND BOARD MEMBER CONNIE LEYVA. A FIRST OF ITS KIND SMOG. WE MAY HAVE SOME TECHNICAL ISSUES TO RANDALL CAN YOU HEAR US. TECHNOLOGIES IN OFF ROAD APPLICATIONS. RELATED TO FREIGHT MOVEMENT SPECIFICALLY WE ARE PURSUING REGULATIONS FOR TRANSPORTATION REFRIGERATION UNITS AND CARGO HANDLING EQUIPMENT AT SEA PORTS AND RAIL YARDS. OTHER EXAMPLES NOT SHOWN ON THE SLIDE INCLUDE PLANS TO PHASE IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY IN COMMERCIAL HARBOR CRAFT LARGE SPARK IGNITION EQUIPMENT AND EQUIPMENT WITH SMALL OFF ROAD ENGINES. AN EXAMPLE OF THE BENEFITS THAT HEAVY DUTY EMISSION REDUCTIONS MEASURES COMES IN THE LATEST REPORT JUST RELEASED BY THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. THIS REPORT SHOWS THAT REGULATIONS ON HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES HAD SIGNIFICANT PUBLIC HEALTH BENEFITS FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS BUT IN PARTICULAR FOR COMMUNITIES OF COLOR AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. COURT FINDS THAT DIESEL PARTICULATE CONCENTRATIONS FROM HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES DECREASED BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND TWENTY NINETEEN. THE MOST SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTIONS WERE IN CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES MOST IMPACTED. IN THESE COMMUNITIES AVERAGE DIESEL PARTICULATE LEVELS DROPPED TO LESS THAN 25% OF THEIR TWO THOUSAND LEVELS BY TWENTY NINETEEN. HOWEVER DESPITE THIS POSITIVE DEVELOPMENT THESE COMMUNITIES STILL FACE INEQUITABLE AIR POLLUTION BURDENS COMPARED TO OTHER COMMUNITIES AND GREATER ACTION WILL BE NEEDED TO CLOSE THE GAP REQUIRES THAT WE USE ONLY ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. AND IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE DIESEL PARTICULATE CONCENTRATIONS BY STANDARDS. THESE REDUCTIONS COULD AVOID THIRTY EIGHT HUNDRED PREMATURE DEATHS STEMMING FROM DIESEL EXPOSURE AND PEOPLE OF COLOR WE COUNT FOR TWO THIRDS OF THESE AVOIDED DEATHS. OUR FOCUS MUST BE ON TRANSITIONING TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY AS QUICKLY AND AS POSSIBLE AND AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE TO MAXIMIZE THE HEALTH BENEFITS. THE EXECUTIVE ORDER SETS CALIFORNIA ON A PATH TO COMPLETELY TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. HOWEVER LOW CARBON ALTERNATIVE FUELS WILL STILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN MEETING OUR GHG AND AIR QUALITY GOALS IN THE NEAR TERM. AND THE ORDER CALLS FOR CONTINUED FOCUS ON DECARBONISING ALTERNATIVE FUELS THAT DISPLACE FOSSIL FUELS IN VEHICLES THAT STILL RELY ON COMBUSTION. THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD OR LCS FAST IS THE STATE'S PRIMARY PROGRAM FOR DECARBONIZING TRANSPORTATION FUELS BY DIVERSIFYING THE FUEL POOL AND SUPPORTING LOW CARBON TECHNOLOGIES WHILE REPLACING FOSSIL FUELS. HYDROGEN IS ONE OF THE MANY LOW CARBON FEEL SUPPORTED BY THE L. THAT. HYDROGEN FUEL PRODUCED FROM LOW CARBON RESOURCES LIKE BIOMETHANE FOR ZERO CARBON ELECTRICITY GENERATES CREDITS UNDER THE PROGRAM TODAY AND ON AVERAGE HYDROGEN. VEHICLE FUEL HAS A 60% LOWER CARBON INTENSITY THAN GASOLINE AND IS 1100% CLEANER THAN GASOLINE WITH REGARD TO AIR POLLUTION EMISSIONS AT THE TAILPIPE CARE RANDOLPH WE HAVE YET TEN MINUTES IF YOU'D LIKE TO WRAP UP THE SLIDE THAT THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH. R. EIGHT THANK YOU I JUST WANTED TO NOTE THAT THERE IS A LOT OF CONVERSATION ABOUT THE VARIOUS COLORS OF HYDROGEN. BROWN BLUE GREEN BUT WE CAN'T. HOLD ONE TECHNOLOGY THAT COMBATS AIR POLLUTION AND CLIMATE CHANGE TO A HIGHER STANDARD THAN OTHERS ANYTHING THAT IS CLEANER THAN FOSSIL FUEL HELPS. AND OUR TECHNOLOGY WILL INVOLVE EVOLVES AND THOSE BILLS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE EVEN CLEANER AS WE MOVE TOWARDS OUR- FUTURE. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT BEFORE THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO RANDOLPH WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WONDERFUL PRESENTATION- SO MEMBERS WE WILL GO NEXT TO OUR SECOND PANELIST TO IS COMMISSIONER PATRICIA MONAHAN. FROM THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND AFTER THIS PANEL WE WILL OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AND QUESTIONS FROM MEMBERS OF EACH PANEL WE WILL WE WILL BE PROVIDING OPPORTUNITY FOR MEMBER QUESTIONS. WELCOME COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE YOU MAY HAVE THE FLURRY OF TEN MINUTES. THANK YOU AND GOOD AFTERNOON WELL I WANT TO EXPRESS MY THANKS TO CHAIR GONZALEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE SENATE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO DISCUSS THE ROLE OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS LIKE NATURAL GAS ELECTRICITY AND HYDROGEN. FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. NOW THIS FEELS ALL HAVE IN COMMON THE FACT THAT THEY CUT HARMFUL DIESEL POLLUTION AND HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS THAT ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET DEADLINES. THE WAY TO STRONGER VEHICLE EMISSIONS STANDARDS WHILE SHOWING THERE ARE CLEANER ALTERNATIVES THAT WORK FOR INDUSTRY. AS CHAIR AROUND OFF HAS HIGHLIGHTED NOW WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY OPPORTUNITY TO ZERO OUT POLLUTION FROM TRANSPORTATION WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC TECHNOLOGIES. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT BOTH OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE ELECTRIC- SO EV'S WOULD YOU KOW ACTUALLY APPLY TO BOTH BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES VEHICLES OR WHAT WE LIKE TO CALL CENTERS ARE KEY TO CALIFORNIA MEETING OUR TARGETS FOR CLIMATE AND CLEAN AIR. AND FOR SHORTHAND I'M GONNA I'M GONNA REFER TO ZERO EMISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AS BIG SETS B. SO BEFORE I DISCUSS THE ROLE OF EACH OF THESE FUELS. I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE RULES OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD ARE DISTINCT AND COMPLEMENTARY. YOUR RESOURCES BOARD FOCUSES ON THE VEHICLE INCENTIVES AND REGULATIONS FOR BOTH VEHICLES AND FUELS. THE ENERGY COMMISSION MY AGENCY FOCUSES ON INCENTIVES AND ANALYSIS. TO BUILD OUT REVEALING INFRASTRUCTURE MAKE SURE THEY'RE SUFFICIENT INFRASTRUCTURE FOR OUR TO MEET OUR OUR CLEAN TRANSPORTATION GOALS. THE ENERGY COMMISSION'S PRIMARY SOURCE OF TRANSPORTATION RELATED GRANT FUNDING IS TO THE CLEAN TRACK TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM. THE PROGRAM RECEIVES UP TO ONE HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDING PER YEAR THROUGH A SURCHARGE ON VEHICLE REGISTRATIONS AND SMOG ABATEMENT SEES. THE PROGRAM WAS ORIGINALLY AUTHORIZED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT RE AUTHORIZED IN TWENTY THIRTEEN AND IS SET TO EXPIRE AT THE END OF NEXT YEAR TWENTY TWENTY THREE BUDGET INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT ONE SIX FIVE BILLION. TARGETED SPECIFICALLY FOR SEVEN STRUCTURE AND THAT MANUFACTURING. THIS YEAR THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING OVER TWO BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS FOR SEVEN FOR STRUCTURE. WITH OVER HALF TARGETED TO EXAMS. IF APPROVED THE PROPOSED FUNDING WILL HELP US INCREASES EVERY FUELING FOR BIG SAYS. AND WILL HELP LOWER INCOME FAMILIES GET ACCESS TO CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO AS CHAIR AROUND ALL HIGHLIGHTED VEHICLE REGULATIONS ARE SETTING A COURSE FOR ZERO EMISSIONS WHEREVER POSSIBLE. IN THE VEHICLE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IS RESPONDING HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS THE GLOBE. DAIMLER TRUCK FOR EXAMPLE HAS SET A GOAL THAT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES WILL MAKE UP 60% OF ITS SALES BY TWENTY THIRTY AND A 100% BY TWENTY THIRTY NINE. LAST YEAR EV'S WERE CALIFORNIA'S NUMBER ONE EXPORT AND CALIFORNIA IS RANKED NUMBER ONE WHEN IT COMES TO THAT MANUFACTURING. WE ARE THE NEW MICHIGAN WHEN IT COMES TO SAYS. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE CALIFORNIA'S ZERO EMISSION PASSENGER VEHICLE SALES. EACH THE HIGHEST EVER HAD OVER 12% ABOUT TWO HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND PLUG IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND THREE THOUSAND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES WERE SOLD LAST YEAR. AND IN THE LAST QUARTER OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE HIT THE MILESTONE OF HAVING ONE MILLION SAM SOLD. SO BIG SUBS ARE MORE NASCENT BUT THAT SECTOR COULD ACTUALLY ELECTRIFY FASTER WHEN THERE'S A STRONG BUSINESS CASE. WE KNOW THAT LAUGHTER OBSERVE REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IS A MAJOR BARRIER TO LAWS THAT COMMERCIALIZATION WHETHER THAT'S FOR PASSENGER VEHICLES ARE BIG THAT. AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN REQUIRES MY AGENCY TO CONDUCT AN ANALYSIS OF TWENTY THIRTY CHARGER NEEDS AND TO UPDATE THAT ANNOUNCES EVERY TWO YEARS. WE PARTNERED WITH NATIONAL LABS AND MAJOR UNIVERSITIES TO CONDUCT THE INAUGURAL REPORT THAT WE RELEASED LAST YEAR. COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN. EXACTLY ESPECIALLY FOR LONG HAUL TRUCKS AND HEAVY DUTY EQUIPMENT. SB SIX FORTY THREE WHICH WAS SPONSORED BY SENATOR ARCHULETA AND PASSED INTO LAW LAST YEAR THE ENERGY COMMISSION WILL BE CONDUCTING ANNOUNCES OF HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS IN TWENTY THIRTY FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT WE HAVEN'T YET DONE THAT ANNOUNCES. SO LET ME DIVE MORE DEEPLY INTO THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WHEN IT COMES TO BATTERY ELECTRIC AND HYDROGEN FUEL CELL ELECTRIC REFUELLING. I'M GONNA START WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC. SO WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE THESE BIG BATTERIES ON WHEELS TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLES AND SUPPORTED CLEAN GRID. WE NEED THE EXAMS TO BE. THINGS THAT WERE HAVING A BIT OF WIFI ISSUES BUT I THINK- SORRY ABOUT THAT COMMISSIONER WE CAN HEAR YOU NOW HOLIDAYS ON OUR END HERE IN THE SENATE FLOOR WE MEET THAT. BE SKIPPING A LITTLE BIT BUT GO RIGHT AHEAD I APOLOGIZE. OKAY SHOULD I START WHERE I WAS OR DO I NEED TO GO BACK YOU KNOW HOW LONG. YOU CAN GO BACK LIKE ABOUT TEN SECONDS. IN SECONDS ALL RIGHT- WELL- HYDROGEN I HAVE EMISSION BATTERY- OKAY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE WELL I WAS SAYING THAT HYDROGEN HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY AND WE'RE GOING TO BE DOING AN ANALYSIS OF TWENTY THIRTY HYDROGEN REFUELING NEEDS FOR BIG STEPS BUT WE HAVEN'T YET DONE THAT. AND THAT WILL. SO I'M GONNA START. TALKING JUST MORE DEEPLY ABOUT BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLE REFUELLING. SO WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO USE BATTERIES TO INTEGRATE RENEWABLES AND HELP MEET OUR CLEAN GREAT GOALS WE NEED BIG SENSE TO BE A GOOD CITIZENS OF THE GRANT. ARE AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN REPORT FOUND THAT EASY CHARGING FOR BIG THAT CAN INCREASE LOAD UP 26% IN TWENTY THIRTY COMPARED WITH CURRENT STATEWIDE ELECTRICITY LOAD. THAT'S A LOT OF FLEXIBLE LOAD AND WE CAN USE IT FOR SMART WE CAN USE THAT TO HELP. MAKE OUR GRID MORE RESILIENT. WHERE POSSIBLE WE WANT TO TIME THE CHARGING A BIG DEBTS TO COINCIDE WITH RENEWABLE ENERGY GENERATION THE BIG SAYS CAN LITERALLY RUN ON SUNSHINE. INTEGRATING RENEWABLES PLUS STORAGE CAN MAKE CHARGING COSTS LOWER AND THE SYSTEM MORE RESILIENT. OUT ONE OF THE PROJECTS WE FUNDED THAT ARE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT IS A TWENTY FIVE MAKE A LOT PUBLIC CHARGING STATION FOR BIG SUBS IN BAKERSFIELD. THAT INCLUDES A MICROGRID INTEGRATING SOLAR PLUS STORAGE. THERE'S ALSO THE POSSIBILITY OF USING BIG SAYS AS A SOURCE OF GREAT ENERGY. SO FOR EXAMPLE WE FUNDED OVER TWO HUNDRED ELECTION ELECTRIC SCHOOL BUSES WITH THE CAPABILITY TO GET ELECTRICITY BACK TO THE GRID AT PEAK TIMES. AND NOW WE'RE FUNDING PROJECTS TO TRY TO UNLOCK THAT VALUE. SO A KEY CHALLENGE BECAUSE WE'RE ALL AWARE OF CHARGES IS THAT IT TAKES A LONG TIME. UNDER THE BEST CASE IT WOULD TAKE THIRTY MINUTES TO REFILL THE VEHICLE BUT MORE LIKELY WOULD TAKE MUCH LONGER COMPARED WITH FIVE TO TEN MINUTES FOR DIESEL OR HYDROGEN. IN ADDITION THERE CAN BE LOCALIZED DISTRIBUTION LEVEL IMPACTS TO THE GRID. SO WE NEED TO PLAN ACCORDINGLY AND ENSURE THEIR ENSURE THERE IS CLOSE COORDINATION WITH UTILITIES. NOW LET ME TURN THE HYDROGEN REFUELLING FOR- EXISTENCE. SO LIKE CHARGING HYDROGEN FOR FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES PRESENTS OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL AS CHALLENGES. ADVANTAGES INCLUDE OR DESELECT REVEALING EXPERIENCE LONGER RANGE AND A LIGHTER WEIGHT SO TRUCKERS CAN HAUL MORE GOODS. THESE ADVANTAGES ARE PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT WHEN IT COMES TO LONG HAUL TRUCKS. THE CHALLENGE AGAIN I THINK THIS IS NO SURPRISE THERE'S A LACK OF REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE. SO TWO YEARS AGO THE ENERGY COMMISSION EXPANDED OUR PUBLIC HYDROGEN STATION INVESTMENTS TO INCLUDE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. LAST YEAR'S BUDGET SHOULD GIVE US SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO REACH THE STATE'S GOAL OF HAVING TWO HUNDRED. WE'RE ALSO FUNDING DEEPER REVEALING TO SUPPORT SIX HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS FOR MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. WITH THE FUELING CAPABILITY TO SERVE ABOUT EIGHTY CLASS EIGHT FUEL CELL DRAYAGE TRUCKS ABOUT FORTY ONE HUNDRED FORTY FIVE TRANSIT BUSES AT ABOUT TEN LOCOMOTIVES. AS OF TODAY THE ENERGY COMMISSION CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS INVESTED A LITTLE OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION IN HYDROGEN REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR LIGHT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED MORE IN HYDROGEN REFUELLING INFRASTRUCTURE THAN ANY NATION IN THE WORLD SAVE TO PAM. BESIDES A LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE OTHER CHALLENGES INCLUDE READING THE HYDROGEN SUPPLY DRIVING DOWN THE COST OF HYDROGEN. HYDROGEN SOURCED SHORTAGES AND STATION DOWNTIME DUE TO THE NASCENT NATURE OF THE TECHNOLOGY. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED BUDGET INCLUDES A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR GREEN HYDROGEN WHICH WOULD BE A NO REGRETS INVESTMENTS THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO EXPLORE HOW TO SCALE GREEN HYDROGEN PRODUCTION FOR TRANSPORTATION BUT ALSO FOR ENERGY STORAGE AND OTHER. AND OTHER PURPOSES. SO FINALLY I WANT TO ADDRESS NATURAL GAS. ENERGY COMMISSION'S CLEAN TRANSPORTATION PROGRAM HAS A LONG HISTORY OF FUNDING NATURAL GAS VEHICLES NAMES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. IN FACT WE FUNDED IT FOR ELEVEN YEARS- FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PROGRAM UNTIL- FISCAL YEAR TWENTY EIGHTEEN TWENTY NINETEEN. NATURAL GAS THAT'S BEEN A CLEANER ALTERNATIVE TO DIESEL% AND IT'S HELPED PUSH DIESEL TO GET CLEANER. WHILE DEMONSTRATE INDUSTRY THAT ALTERNATIVE FUELS CAN CA PERFORM JUST AS WELL AS DIESEL. BUT NOW IS YOUR RENTAL HIGHLIGHTED WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEED THE TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION TRANSPORTATION. WE'VE HEARD FROM MANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING THOSE REPRESENTING LOW INCOME AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THAT ARE FUNDING SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON ZERO MISSION AND THAT IT SHOULD PROVIDE TANGIBLE DIRECT BENEFITS TO COMMUNITIES. THE CARD THE BILL'S REGULATIONS THAT SET A COURSE FOR ZERO EMISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT ARE FUNDING PROGRAMS PRESENT INTEREST JUNCTURE ARE HELPING INDUSTRY REACH THOSE TARGETS. AND WE'RE STRIVING TO FUTURE PROOF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS AND SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY HARMFUL TAILPIPE POLLUTION. SO IN CONCLUSION I WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ZERO OUT EMISSIONS FOR OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS WITHIN SIGHT. I'VE BEEN IN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION SPACE FOR TWENTY FIVE YEARS AND I'M MORE CONFIDENT TODAY THAN I HAVE EVER BEEN THAT THE FUTURE IS YOUR MISSION. BUT I'M ALSO CLEAR I THAT THERE ARE MAJOR CHALLENGES TO OVERCOME INCLUDING A LACK OF ZEBRA FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE. THE BUILD OUT OF THAT REVEALING INFRASTRUCTURE IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO ENSURING CALIFORNIA CAN MEET OUR TARGETS. AND TO SUPPORT COMMUNITIES THAT ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY HARMFUL POLLUTION. SO THANK YOU AND I LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND YOUR COMMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT PRESENTATION COMMISSIONER WE APPRECIATE YOUR TIME THANK YOU VERY MUCH. A NEXT MEMBERS WE WILL GO ON TO OUR THIRD PANELIST WHO IS MISTER ROSS BROWN PRINCIPLE FISCAL AND POLICY AND IT ANALYSTS EXCUSE ME WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE MISTER BROWN WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ROSS BROWN WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S. HEARING IN MY BRIEF TIME HERE I DO JUST WANT TO HIGHLIGHT A FEW KEY QUESTIONS AND CONSIDERATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE AS IT EXPLORES. THE ISSUE OF HEAVY DUTY EMISSIONS AND THIS HEARING AND BEYOND SO I'M JUST GONNA LOOK- JUMP INTO THOSE THREE. KEY ISSUES AND QUESTIONS NOW SO FIRST. WE THINK IT'S IMPORTANT- TO REMEMBER THE HEAVY DUTY IN OFF ROAD VEHICLES REALLY DO INCLUDE A DIVERSE MIX OF VEHICLES EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGIES. BUT NOT LIKE A LIGHT DUTY PASSENGER CARS WHERE- YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE SIMILAR TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICE SIMILAR PURPOSE. AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE. DIFFERENT STAGES OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT- AND AT THE END OF THAT TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT COULD BE DIFFERENT BETWEEN A TRANSIT BUS FOR EXAMPLE AND LONG HAUL TRUCKS. ARE SO AS A RESULT THE CHALLENGES AND APPROPRIATE STATE PROGRAMS AND POLICIES MIGHT DIFFER DRAMATICALLY AND SO- THEM IT'S NOT REALLY A KIND OF ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH- THE SECOND. QUESTION AND I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT FOR THE COMMITTEE- IS KIND OF THIS QUESTION ABOUT- TECHNOLOGY INCOME WHEN TO BE TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL IN WHEN TO PUSH SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGIES THAT. MIGHT APPEAR MORE PROMISING SO FOR EXAMPLE HYDROGEN AND BATTERY ELECTRIC OR BOTH AND SO. UNFORTUNATELY I THINK THERE'S NOT A SIMPLE ANSWER TO THIS QUESTION A DOZEN BALLS- SOME TRADE OFFS AND JUDGMENT. IN GENERAL IN THE EARLY STAGES ARE WE THINK. TECHNOLOGICALLY NEUTRAL APPROACHES CAN GIVE AN OPPORTUNITY FOR THE- THE BEST TECHNOLOGY TO WIN- MAKES SENSE HOWEVER THE DOES. IN MANY CASES COME A POINT WHERE IT MIGHT NOT MAKE SENSE TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN AND THOSE TECH CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES ANYMORE AND SO. AGAIN I DON'T HAVE AN EXACT ANSWER BUT WE DO THINK THIS IS A- KEY QUESTION FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER AND PERHAPS. THAT'S THE ADMINISTRATION OTHER PANELISTS IN THIS. HEARING AT WHAT POINT DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO FOCUS ON SPECIFIC TECH. HOW DO I HOW DO AGE ABOUT THIS ISSUE OR CRITERIA DID THEY USE. AND WHAT METRICS- TO THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE INTEREST US US. THE THIRD AND FINAL QUESTION I JUST WANTED TO. HIGHLIGHT IS WHICH BUDGET ITEMS. MIGHT THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO PRIORITIZE IN THIS AREA AND AGAIN THIS MATERIAL WHERE THERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS TO CONSIDER. SO THERE'S REALLY THREE MAIN TYPES OF. HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE PROGRAMS THERE'S RETIREMENT AND REPLACEMENT PROGRAMS LIKE THE KERR MOYER PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE WITH. CLEANER TECHNOLOGIES ARE CLEANER ENGINES WHICH TENDS TO BE IN A MORE COST EFFECTIVE APPROACH FOR NEAR TERM AIR POLLUTION REDUCTIONS. THERE'S HEAVY DUTY ON OR OFF-ROAD VOUCHERS LIKE THAT EACH STEP PROGRAM WHICH OFTEN GO TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. WHICH APPEARS TO BECOME A MORE COST EFFECTIVE IN THE NEAR TERM FOR GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTIONS. AND THERE'S PILOTS AND DEMONSTRATIONS WHICH- DO MORE TO ADVANCE THEIR EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. WHICH CAN HAVE RELATED MORE LONGER TERM BENEFITS IN TERMS OF GHGS AND- POLLUTION BUT MIGHT BE MORE COSTLY IN THE NEAR TERM AND SO THIS IS REALLY KIND OF LIKE A KEY DECISION. FOR THE LEGISLATURE ON HOW TO PRIORITIZE AMONG THESE DIFFERENT GOALS WHEN A GERMAN IN ITS BUDGET ALLOCATIONS AND LARGELY DEPENDS ON. THE LEGISLATORS POLICY PRIORITIES AND HOW IT BOUNCES. SHORT TERM REDUCTIONS WITH A LONGER TERM- DEEPER REDUCTIONS IN THERE G. H. I WILL IN MY COMMENTS AMONG THE TENS OF. HELP YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER BROWN WE PAY YOUR AND WELL IN YOUR- THANK YOU. NEXT MEMBERS WE OUR OUR FOURTH PANELIST WHO IS MR MIA THOUGHT TO WHO'S ACTUALLY DEPUTY DIRECTOR OFFICER. FOR SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY ADVANCEMENT WITH SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THIS IS A LATE SUBSTITUTE FOR- EXECUTIVE OFFICER WIND MASTERY- MISTER MINNESOTA THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. WELCOME YOUR THREE MINUTES. OF THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE. US I'M DOCTOR MATTHEWS- THE CHIEF TECHNOLOGIST AT THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT WHICH IS THE LARGEST AIR DISTRICT IN THE NATION. IN AS MANY OF YOU KNOW WE SUFFER FROM THE WORST AIR QUALITY IN THE NATION MOSTLY DUE TO MOBILE SOURCES. OF WHICH WE HAVE ALMOST NO REGULATORY AUTHORITY WE'RE ALSO HOME TO NEARLY 67% OF ALL ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. AND OUR FAILURE TO MEET THE IMPENDING EPA STANDARDS FOR CLEAN AIR NOT ONLY RESULTS IN UNHEALTHY AIR FOR ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS. BUT COULD RESULT IN EBAY SANCTIONS TO CUT BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN TRANSPORTATION FUNDING. INCREASE COSTS FOR LOCAL BUSINESSES TO THE TUNE OF ABOUT FORTY TO FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS AN INCREASE PERMANENT FEES. AND THE POTENTIAL FEDERAL GO OVER OUR ERROR EFFORT. NEVER MET THAT'S HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS IN THE STATE OR DIESEL AND ABOUT HALF OF THOSE TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND OR SO OUR INNER BASIN. I JUST WANT TO CLEAR THAT WE FOUR ZERO MISSION TRIP TECHNOLOGIES ARE AS A- COMMISSION MONAHAN SAID BIG SAM'S- AND IN FACT WERE RUNNING THE MOST ADVANCED PROJECTS IN THE STATE IF NOT THE NATION ON. ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY TRUCK. APOLOGIES MATTER KNOWLEDGE AND TECHNIQUE ESTIMATE. IN THE NEXT- TO GET TO THE VOLUMES THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR US TO REPLACE THOUSANDS TENS OF THOUSANDS FIFTY THOUSAND HER THOUSAND TRUCKS IT'LL TAKE ABOUT FIVE TO TEN YEARS AND THAT'S JUST TO GET THE BATTERY OPTIMIZATION RIGHT IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE AS A COMMISSION ONE HAD MENTIONED THAT IN HEAVY DUTY FUEL CELL TRUCKS OR EVEN FURTHER OUT JUST BECAUSE WE'RE STARTING DEMONSTRATION DOES TODAY. INFRASTRUCTURE GRID SUPPORT REMAINS CRITICAL A QUESTIONS FOR BOTH OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES BUT THE SAD FACT IS OUR COMMUNITIES NEED CLEANER NOW THE NEAR ZERO NATURAL GAS ENGINES THAT WE HELP DEVELOP WITH THE ENERGY COMMISSION. ARE COMMERCIALIZED TODAY THERE 90% CLEAR FOR KNOX AND THEY HAVE ZERO A CARCINOGEN CARCINOGENIC DIESEL PARTS THAT ARE- WHICH IT CAN USE THAT JURADO SHOWN HER MAPS THE COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE BY ALL THE DOMESTIC TRUCK MANUFACTURES THE TWO TO THREE TIMES LESS EXPENSIVE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS ARE BIG JOBS AND THEREFORE TO FIVE TIMES EXPENSIVE. THAN HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TRUCKS. SO INDEPENDENT OWNER ON. NEED A FOR. CLEANER OPTIONS OR THEY'RE JUST GONNA BY USE DIESEL TRUCKS AND CONTINUE TO DO SO. I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT NEAR ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS OF FOR YOUR PLACE TODAY. THEY'RENOT PERMANENT RIGHT IT'S NOT A DEAD END WE'RE GOING AFTER PLACES TRUCKS ANOTHER SEVEN TO TEN YEARS AND BY THAT TIME. THEY'LL GO TO ZERO EMISSIONS BUT IN THE NEAR TERM WE SHOULD BE REPLACING THESE DIESEL TRUCKS. WITH 90% CLEANER TRUCKS TO HELP IMPROVE REGIONAL AIR QUALITY AS A AS A- IN ADDITION TO REMOVING TOXIC STORE COMMUNITIES. SO LET ME JUST CLOSE BY SAYING. UNFORTUNATELY WE CANNOT REGULATE OUR WAY OUT OF THIS IMPENDING CLEAN AIR CRISIS WE JUST DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TIME ALL THE SWEETER. AND TECHNOLOGIES ARE REGULATIONS ENSURE ROUND OF SHOTS. THAT SHOW THOSE AREN'T GOING TO TAKE EFFECT ON TWENTY TWENTY SEVEN. SO WE NEED TO REPLACE DIESEL TRUCKS TODAY AND WE BELIEVE THAT USING YOURS OR NATURAL GAS. WORKS IN CONCERT WITH ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS. SO WE NEED INCENTIVES FOR NEAR TERMINUS REDUCTIONS WE BELIEVE THAT SOME OF THAT BUDGET SURPLUS SHOULD BE GOING TOWARD AND CERTIFICATION FROM THE- A CHANGE OUT OF DIESEL TRUCKS TODAY. WHILE WE ALSO PAVE THE WAY FOR ZERO EMISSION TRUCK TECHNOLOGY AND PLANNING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE FUTURE. SO JUST WANT TO THANK THE CHAIR FOR INVITING US TO PROVIDE OUR PERSPECTIVE. AND BE HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU A MYSTERY AS- WE- YOUR TIME AND YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL. OUR FINAL PANELIST IN THIS FIRST PANEL WE HAVE IS MR JOSEPH TONA AIR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICER WE HAVE A ROOM RURAL PERSPECTIVE TO HIM A COUNTY AIR POLLUTION CONTROL DISTRICT-A MISTER TONY MANAGER TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT IMPLEMENTING YOUR ZERO ZERO EMISSION. EVEN HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES RURAL AREAS. WELL STATES MADE TREMENDOUS STRESS. THANK YOU EVERYONE FOR BEING SO PATIENT ON OUR END WE'RE HAVING AUDIO ISSUES SORRY ABOUT THAT MISTER TURNER WOULD YOU MIND STARTING ALL OVER AGAIN WE'RE HAVING AUDIO ISSUES HERE ON THE SENATE FLOOR BUT THANK YOU AGAIN WELCOME. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR OF THE TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE. I'M HERE TO TALK ABOUT IMPLEMENTING NEAR ZERO IN ZERO EMISSION MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES A RURAL AREA. WELL THE STATE HAS MADE TREMENDOUS STRIDES LOCAL SOURCES CONTINUE TO BE THE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR OF EMISSIONS THAT IMPACT OUR HEALTH BASED IN STANDARDS. OF THESE MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTORS. KEEPING A MISSION PRODUCTIONS QUICKLY FROM ALL SOURCES OF IMPORTANT TO RURAL DISTRICTS TO REACH AND MAINTAIN THEIR HEALTH BASED. THAT'S BASED ATTAINMENT GOALS. IMPLEMENTING YOUR ZERO TECHNOLOGY ZERO AREAS ARE MET WITH MULTIPLE DIFFICULTIES. MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY EASY INFRASTRUCTURE IS RARE TO NONEXISTENT RURAL AREAS. THREE IN A ROW AREAS CAN SIGNIFICANT REDUCED RANGE OF CURRENT ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY. AS AN ANECDOTAL EXAMPLE I LIVE IN REDDING CALIFORNIA IF I DRIVE MY PLUG IN HYBRID NORRISTOWN SHASTA CAN GET ABOUT TWENTY FIVE TO THIRTY MILES OF YOU RANGE- SELF THE SACRAMENTO CAN CHIEF ABOUT FORTY FIVE FIFTY MILES OF RANGE. A TOUGH OF OUR- BILLETE DESTINATION IN RURAL AREAS SO MUCH FOR THEIR PARTNER COUNTERPARTS. FINALLY AS IS COMMON WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE RURAL AREAS IS OFTEN THE LAST VEHICLE. OTHER CONCERNS YOUR ABILITY ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES ARE CRITICAL. OVER EVERYTHING VALLEY COMMUNITIES HAVE SEEN A REDUCTION IN. IN THIS COMMUNITIES CONTINGENCY NEEDS SEVERAL MULTI DAY WE CHARACTERS. THREE THE REASON EXAMPLES YOU MISTER NO STORM RIGHT NOW OUT BROUGH IN THE SENATE AREA. PSP IS A BETTER SHOT FOR WE- SIXTY FIVE IN MINERAL HEALTH. I RECOMMEND THE STATE'S SUPPORT EXISTING YEARS ZERO HERE TECHNOLOGIES. THIS TECHNOLOGY SCHOOL FOR THE RE OF A ARE HARMFUL TO HEALTH NEXT OF REACHES ZERO MISSION TO FOR THE IN THE DEMAND WERE YOU CASES. IT'S TIME FOR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ADDITION THE FOR NEIGHBOR DISTRICTS ABLE TO PERMISSION REDUCTIONS QUICKLY THE YEARS YOU MAY HAVE YOUR CALLED NOW DROWNED WHEN HER DISTRICTS COULD BENEFIT FROM THE THREE IS. IN ADDITION RECOMMENDED STATE'S INVESTIGATE THE BILLABLE TORNADOES ABOUT. TO EVERY EFFORT SHOULD BE TAKE TO SAY EXISTING BIOMASS. RESOURCES ALSO TO BE THE TO THE OTHER LONG TERM SYSTEM ALTERNATIVES RESPONSE FOR IMPORTS WASTED YOUR. THIS ISSUE PROVIDE RESOURCES TO THE BILL A THREE USES FORCING OBERNOLTE RESPECT YOUR- USUAL THESE TOOLS ALSO CO BENEFITS THE GREEDY THE NEED X. BURNING IN REDUCING FUEL LOADING ON ARE NOT WORKING LANDS AND- THANK YOU MUCH MR TO. WE YOUR YOUR TIME A PRESENT AS WELL THAT CONCLUDES OUR FIRST PANEL MAY ARE THAT CLEAN. TECH BY EACH OF OUR STATE AGENCIES AND LOCAL- AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT'S ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS AT THIS TIME. WILL HAVE A SENATOR DODD START START US OFF AND THEN WE'LL GO AROUND. TO THE MEMBERS BRIDAL. TRY TO MAKE THIS QUICK MADAM CHAIR I AM GOING TO SERIES OF QUESTIONS HOW MANY. HEAVY DUTY OR BIG RIG ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS OR ON THE ROAD TODAY. AND THEN I'LL JUST THROUGH THE CHAIR- IT WHAT RATE DO YOU EXPECT THAT THEY'LL REPLACE THE CURRENT FLEET OF DIESEL TRUCKS. AND THEN- WHAT IS THE PROJECTIONS FOR THESE BIG RIGS ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS BY TWENTY THIRTY. OKAY LET ALTERNATELY WHAT IS THAT ALL BASED ON AND I'M I'M TRYING TO GET A FEELING OF WHAT WHAT OUR PLAN IS AND- HOW THAT ALL WORKS DON'T KNOW WHO'D LIKE TO START OFF- I KNOW TO RANDOLPH IS STILL HERE SO I SEE HER AND NEEDING GO RIGHT AHEAD. THE THREE QUESTIONS THEY ARE CURRENTLY ON THE ROAD IN TERMS OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. WHAT IS THE STRATEGY FOR DIESEL REPLACEMENT AND THEN PROJECTIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY. SURE SO I DON'T HAVE A NUMBER FOR THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF VEHICLES ON THE ROAD I CAN TELL YOU THAT THERE ARE NUMEROUS MODELS AVAILABLE ON THE MARKET AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO- SORT OF TALK ABOUT THE TECHNOLOGY AND THE USE CASE- WITH THERE ARE MANY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES AVAILABLE. TODAY AND SO THE RIVER A LOT OF TIMES PEOPLE THINK TO THEMSELVES OH WELL I CAN'T ICTURE THIS TRUCK DRIVING TO MONTANA BUT MY POINT IS IN MANY MANY MANY CASES THEY DON'T NEED TO DRIVE TO MONTANA. 63% OF THE TRACTOR TRAILERS IN THE STATE TRAVEL UNDER TWO HUNDRED MILES. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT USE CASES NEAR COURT- HAND AT WAREHOUSES- AND THE SHORTER HAUL THERE'S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY FOR IS THEIR EMISSION VEHICLES. ON IN THOSE SECTORS- AND THEY CAN BE USED- FOR DRAINAGE AND FOR OTHER SHORT HAUL- AND- ACTIVITY AND OF COURSE- YOU KNOW DELIVERY VANS- SMALLER AND MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO- ACQUIRES A REMISSION TECHNOLOGY AND ELECTRIFIED THOSE ROUTES WELL SO WE REALLY NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT THE VARIETY OF USE CASES THAT CAN GO TO ZERO EMISSION- IMMEDIATELY AS WE ARE MOVING MORE TOWARDS- OUR- AT. TWENTY THIRTY AND TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS. THANK YOU AT CHER RANDOLPH WE APPRECIATE THAT ENDS NEXT WE HAVE SENATOR WHITE HOUSE CAN'T FOLLOWED BY SENATOR DOLLY. YEAH I WAS READING TODAY'S CREAM BLOOMBERG GREEN REPORT THEY'VE GOT. ARTICLE BY ASHOT RAFI WHICH TALKS ABOUT UNDERESTIMATING THE IMPACTS OF METHANE AND BASICALLY SEBERG STANFORD GROUP HAS COME UP I'M SURE THE MEMBERS OF CAR BREAK. THEN THE ENERGY COMMISSION UNDERSTAND THE HUNDRED YEAR HORIZON THAT WE LOOK AT FOR REDUCING CARBON AND THEY SUGGESTED WHEN WE LOOK AT METHANE WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT A TWENTY YEAR HORIZON TO RECALCULATE. THOSE THOSE BENEFITS PARTICULARLY IF OUR GOAL IS TO REDUCE. THE TEMPERATURE OF THE EARTH OF THE RISING TEMPERATURE TO ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES AS SET FORTH IN THE PARIS ACCORD RATHER THAN JUST GETTING TWO ZERO- DINNER ZERO BY TWENTY FORTY OF THE SHORT TERM GOAL. IS THAT SO WITH THAT IN MIND. THEN GIVEN THAT THE SOUTH IS URGING. THE USE OF A NEW. NATURAL GAS TO MEET OUR HEATING CONCERNS AND ALSO GET THE PARTICULAR. REDUCTIONS ISN'T. A RECALCULATION NECESSARY GIVEN THIS NEW SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE TWENTY YEAR HORIZON VERSES THE HUNDRED YEAR HORIZON AS FAR AS THE PRIORITIES OF THE- CARB. IN THE ENERGY COMMISSION. YOU KNOW ABSOLUTELY NOTHING IS. A SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT WITH- WITH SIGNIFICANT CLIMATE IMPACTS AND TACKLING METHANE- EMISSIONS IS A KEY PILLAR OF- SB THREE THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE AND- OF OUR OVERALL CLIMATE EFFORTS AND- AND I THINK IT REALLY HIGHLIGHTS THE IMPORTANCE OF GETTING HIS HEARING MISSION- BECAUSE FOSSIL FUELS HAVE METHANE AND WE NEED TO GET TO- TO REDUCE THE IMPACTS. NOTHING ON OUR CLIMATE. I'M SORRY CAN MAKE A COMMENT THIS IS MATT FROM THE SOUTH COAST. RIGHT BUT WE HAD ENCOURAGE MORE A GREATER. INVESTMENT INTO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS IS THE QUESTION I GUESS I UNDERSTAND THE PROBLEM WITH METHANE BUT SOUTH COAST IS ARGUING THAT IN THE NEAR TERM TO GET THE PARTICULATE MATTERS DOWN INTO. HANDLE THE HEAT THE RISING HEAT. RIGHT WE MAY COMPROMISE OUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE GOALS BUT WILL REACH THE GOAL OF THE PROMISE OF PARIS IS THAT THE TEMPERATURE OF THE WORLD WILL NOT. EXPAND EVER INCREASING ABOVE ONE POINT FIVE DEGREES CENTIGRADE. IN CENTER BY CASCADE BELIEVE A DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER MISATO WANTED TO JUMP IN BUT I KNOW CHAPTER RANDOLPH ALSO IS NEEDED AS WELL SO. BUT EITHER OF YOU LIKE TO CHIME IN ON THIS YOU KNOW CAPTURING METHANE- FROM THINGS LIKE LANDFILLS IS A CRITICAL PART OF OUR OVERALL STRATEGY AND THERE ARE CERTAINLY USES FOR THAT RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS THAT WE ABSOLUTELY SHOULD X. THE EXPLORING. BUT I THINK AS AS TECHNOLOGY INVOLVES WE NEED TO BE UNDERSTANDING WHETHER TRANSPORTATION IS REALLY THE PLACE FOR THAT OR IF OTHER USES OR THE PLACE FOR THAT. YEAH AND I KNOW THAT COMMISSIONER MONAHAN AND HER AGENCY DOES A LOT OF THE G. SHE MODELING I JUST WANTED. TO ADD THAT WE GET THE RENEWABLE METHANE. AS A LONG TERM SOLUTION AS I MENTIONED IT'S A SHORT TERM SOLUTION UNTIL ZERO EMISSIONS BECOME FULLY AVAILABLE. AND JUST TO ADD TO RESPOND CENTER DOTS QUESTION BUT THERE'S LESS THAN A HUNDRED ZERO MISSION BAY EXAMS ON THE ROAD TODAY. THANK YOU HE SAID THANK YOU- SO APPRECIATE THAT- DEPUTY EXECUTIVE OFFICER. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SENATOR WHAT HOUSE HE WILL GO ON TO SENATOR DELHI. THANK YOU MADAM THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS- MY QUESTION IS FOR CHAIR RAND OFF FIRST I WANT TO JUST. BACK UP TO TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHTEEN WE HAD A EXECUTIVE ORDER BY GOVERNOR BROWN. WHICH WAS FIVE MILLION ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY WITH THAT EXECUTIVE ORDER IN SEVENTY NINE TWENTY BY GOVERNOR NEWSOM. STATUS IN A STATE LIKE ALL THE PASSENGER ARS AND TRUCKS. WILL BE ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND AT A HUNDRED PERCENT. OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. WITH ZERO EMISSIONS BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE. WITH DRIED STRUCK TO MEETING THAT GOAL BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE SO THOSE ARE EXECUTIVE ORDERS. THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THE LAST TWO GOVERNORS. WE HAVE THE DIABLO CANYON WHICH IS THREE THOUSAND MEGAWATTS OF ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA WE DON'T COUNT LARGE HYDRO. IN RENEWABLE RESOURCES SO MY QUESTION IS. IF WE'RE GOING TO PUT FIVE MILLION JUST THE FIRST EXECUTIVE ORDER FIVE MILLION CARS ON THE ROAD IS GOING TO INCREASE OUR NEED OF ELECTRICITY. USAGE FROM ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN. SENT A SINGLE FAST CHARGER FOR EIGHTY- TWO FOUR TRUCKS WILL DRAW ELECTRICITY IN THE AMOUNT OF ABOUT TWO HUNDRED HOMES OR COULD BE HIGHER ADDING CHARGING DEEP OIL TEN TEN TO TWENTY CHARGERS WOULD BE LIKE ADDING A SMALL CITY SO MY QUESTION IS IF WE HAVE ONLY A HUNDRED. WE HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED ELECTRIC THE TRUCK VEHICLES RIGHT NOW AND WE NEED TO GET AROUND. FIFTY THOUSAND. OUR HOUSE OUR GRID. GOING TO SUPPLY THE ELECTRICITY THAT WE NEED. BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE THAT'S FOURTEEN YEARS FROM NOW. WHAT DID SHE AROUND UP WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT IF I TOOK THIS QUESTION SO CENTER DOLLY- THIS IS PATTY MOUNTAIN ENERGY COMMISSION AND- IT'S A GREAT QUESTION AND IT'S ONE THAT WE HAVE WRESTLED WITH- BOTH WE ARE WE ARE WORKING WITH OUR PARTNER IN ENERGY AGENCIES AND THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN DOING A REGULAR ANALYSIS- DEMAND FORECAST OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. NOT JUST FOR TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION SIR BUT MORE BROADLY ACROSS ALL OF OUR SECTORS AND THE THIS IS A VERY ROBUST ANALYSIS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT AS WE- YOU KNOW SET TARGETS THAT THE GRID IS READY. AND I THINK WE'RE ALL WORRIED YOU KNOW THAT IF IT'S BEEN A ROUGH RIDE THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS AND ENERGY AGENCIES HAVE REALLY WORKED TOGETHER TO MAKE SURE THAT GOING FORWARD. I HAVE THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF PROCUREMENTS TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE INCREASED NEED ON THE GRID FOR TRESPASS LETTER CATION BUILDING LET'S CREATION AND OTHER PURPOSES- I WOULD ALSO EMPHASIZE THAT. AS WE ARE BUILDING OUT INFRASTRUCTURE. ESPECIALLY FOR BIG. THERE IS THIS OP. TO CAPITALIZE ON LOWER RIVER ENERGY PRICES. AT THAT STORAGE. AND CREATE A MORE RESILIENT SYSTEM. THIS IS SOMETHING WE'VE INVESTED AND FOR EXAMPLE IN SANTA CLARA VALLEY TRANSIT WHERE WE'VE- INVEST IN A MICROGRID. THAT COULD REVEAL OF THE THIRTY BUSES WHEN THE GREATEST DOWN. AND WHEN THE GRID IS DOWN USUALLY YOU CAN'T REFUEL YOUR- INTERNAL COMBUSTION YOU CAN'T REVEAL GASOLINE OR DIESEL EITHER THEY RUN ON ELECTRICITY AS WELL SO. THIS IDEA OF LIKE WHAT HOW DO WE INVEST IN THE TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE FUTURE THAT WE'RE GOING TO NEED. THAT WILL CREATE A MORE RESILIENT ENERGY SYSTEM. AND. AND ALLOW US TO. BUILD THE BUSINESS CASE FOR TRANSPORTATION ELECTRIFICATION. WELL I WOULD SAY THAT- GASOLINE AND DIESEL STATIONS DO HAVE THE ABILITY IF THEY HAVE A GENERATOR BUT THIS LEGISLATURE OUTLAWED GENERATORS- IN IN A BILL LAST YEAR SO LOOK LAST YEAR THE GOVERNOR ASKED. PEOPLE WHO OWN ELECTRIC VEHICLES TO NOT PLUG THEM IN BECAUSE WE WERE IN A POWER SHORTAGE AND SO I THINK THAT. THE FRUSTRATION FOR ME IS THAT WE PASSED ALL THESE EXECUTIVE ORDERS WITHOUT THE LEGISLATURE ACTUALLY BEING INVOLVED IN WE SET TARGETS AND WE DON'T HAVE ANY IDEA HOW TO GET THE TARGETS- THIS EXACT SAME THING. THAT WE SEE WITH THE BULLET TRAIN IS SUPPOSED TO REDUCE CARBON AND IT'S TEN YEARS IN THE MAKING AND WE HAVEN'T SEEN ONE FOR THE TRACK LATE SO. LOOK THIS IS THIS IS DRIVING UP THE WE HAVE 60% HIGHER ELECTRICITY RATES. IN CALIFORNIA THAN THE AVERAGE OF THE NATION. WE HAVE THE HIGHEST GAS PRICES HIGHER THAN WHITE. THEY DON'T PRODUCE OIL IN HAWAII THEY DO IN CALIFORNIA. AND THE COST OF LIVING IS DRIVING. CALIFORNIANS TO LEAVE THE STATE SO I'M WHAT I'M ASKING YOU IS. YOUR YOUR TALK ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS FROM NOW HOW ARE WE GOING TO GET. THE INFRASTRUCTURE WE NEED AND I CAN'T FOR THE I CAN'T FIND WERE GONNA DO THIS OLD BATTERIES. BATTERY'S STORAGE IS AND THEN ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE TAKING OFF. ELECTRICITY GENERATION WE'RE GOING TO TAKE ON THREE THOUSAND MEGADETH DOLLARS JUST WANTED SKEWS ME FOR INTERRUPTING YOU HAVE A QUESTION YES THE QUESTION IS ON TIME THE QUESTION SHE ANSWERED THE QUESTION IS THIS IS THE ANSWER I GOT IS NOT ACCEPTABLE THAT WE HAVE. WE'RE GONNA HAVE MICROGRID JIM WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA DO WE HAVE LESS THAN A HUNDRED TRUCKS I WANT TO KNOW THE LONG TERM DOES NOT TELLING ME HOW WE'RE GONNA GET THERE BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. AND I WITH THE ANSWER AND YOU KNOW THE CHAIRMAN OF THE ERROR THE- CALIFORNIA RESOURCES BOARD DIRECTING THE MONEY. THAT IS COLLECTED. FROM THEIR RESOURCE FOR- FROM THE FUEL TO. THE CARBON ATTACKS. AND I'M ASKING HOW WE'RE GONNA GET ABOUT TWENTY THIRTY FIVE I AM NOT GOING TO SATISFY. SAYS FOR FACTORY. ANSWER BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE ONE. BECAUSE THERE'S NO PLANNING THAT'S THE POINT. WE NEED TO HAVE THE LEGISLATURE INVOLVED SO THAT WE CAN PLAN. FOR THE FUTURE OF CALIFORNIA FOR REALLY GONNA LEAD THE WORLD. IN THE ABILITY. TO SHOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO. REDUCE CARBON IN CALIFORNIA AND ALL ALL IN WITH THIS LAST STATEMENT. WE DO NOT EVEN COUNTY. WILDFIRES WHICH IS THE BIGGER. BIGGEST EMITTER OF CARBON. IN ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S NOT EVEN COUNTED IN OUR CARBON. EMISSIONS THANK YOU MATTER ALLEY AND THIS IS WHY WE'RE HERE ACTUALLY TO HAVE THESE DISCUSSIONS ON WHAT TO DO NEXT AS THE LEGISLATURE. WE'VE GOT A DEADLINE ON FRIDAY TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE BILLS THAT ARE READY TO GO ON THIS VERY MATTER. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR DOLLY- CENTER ARCHULETA YOUR NEXT. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR HAVING US ALL HERE TOGETHER TODAY AND I THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR AND ESPECIALLY ALL THE GUESTS WHO ARE HERE WITH US TODAY MY DISTRICT THE THIRTY SECOND DISTRICT- IS MISSION OVER INTO THE NEW THIRTY AT THE TWENTY NINTH COMMISSION NEW THIRTIES SO WE'VE GOT CHANGES IN CALIFORNIA WHEN IT COMES TO DISTRICTING BUT ONE THING HASN'T CHANGED MY DISTRICT IS THE NUMBER OF- FREEWAYS AND TRAFFIC AND SO ON- IN THE EMISSIONS THAT ARE OUT THERE IN THESE MAJOR FREEWAY SIX MAJOR FREEWAYS. THROUGH MY DISTRICT IS HAS LED ME TO- PUT ON THE TABLE SENATE BILL SIX FORTY THREE AND IT- ALL OF YOU KNOW THAT IT THAT REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION AND COULDN'T A CONSULTATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION TO PREPARE A STATEWIDE ASSESSMENT THE FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE. FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE IN FUEL PRODUCTION NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE ADOPTION OF ZERO EMISSIONS TRUCKS BUSES AND OFF ROAD VEHICLES THAT BEING SAID. IT CONJUNCTION WITH THAT I'D ALSO LIKE TO ASK- COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN. IS WHAT IS. WHAT WHAT IS CALIFORNIA DOING HOW ARE WE BEING POSITION TO SECURE PART OF THAT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL DOLLARS. THAT ARE COMING. TO CALIFORNIA FOR HYDROGEN HUBS. BUT THANKS CENTER ARCHULETA AND THANKS FOR YOUR BILL ACTUALLY I'M REALLY WE'RE LOOKING FORWARD TO DOING THAT ANALYSIS I THINK IT'S A REALLY GOOD COMPLEMENT TO THE AB TWENTY ONE TWENTY SEVEN ANNOUNCES ON TV CHARGER NEEDS THROUGH TWENTY THIRTY- AND AS I SAID IN MY REMARKS I MEAN HYDROGEN HAS AN IMPORTANT ROLE TO PLAY IN THE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SPACE IN PARTICULAR. AND YOU KNOW SO WE'RE TRYING TO DO ALL WE CAN AS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOUR RESOURCES FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE OF BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT. TO POSITION CALIFORNIA TO BE- COMPETITIVE ON GETTING FEDERAL FUNDING FOR A HYDROGEN HUB HERE IN IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA YOU KNOW WE'RE DEFINITELY THERE'S NO STATE THAT HAS DONE AS MUCH AS WE HAVE. ARGUABLY THERE'S NO COUNTRY THAT HAS DONE AS MUCH AS WE HAVE TO SUPPORT FUEL CELLS IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR. AND WE'RE LOOKING MORE BROADLY AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO USE. OF GREEN HYDROGEN A PARTICULAR FOR- TO CREATE A MORE RESILIENT ENERGY SYSTEM AND FOR SECTORS THAT ARE HARD TO DECARBONISE LIKE INDUSTRY AND AIR TRAVEL SO THE SITE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A FEDERAL HOLIDAY. HERE IN CALIFORNIA THAT IS. FOCUSED ON HELPING CALIFORNIA DECARBONISE THE MOST DIFFICULT PARTS OF OUR SECTOR- IS A REAL OPPORTUNITY AND ONE THAT WE THAT WE'RE WE'RE TRYING TO CAPITALIZE ON. I'D LIKE TO GO VISIT HAS BEEN REALLY LEADING SOME OF THAT ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS- IN IN TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA LANDS THE HYDROGEN HUB. FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I JUST LIKE TO FOR UP MANY THAT. OBVIOUSLY THE ENTER. THE TREASURE CHEST THE BETTER I CALL IT THE TREASURE SHIP JUST OF ENERGY INCLUDE ALL FORMS. OF ENERGY N. AS WE'RE SPEAKING ABOUT- ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE ALSO HAVE TO THINK ABOUT. A HYDRO CELL AND IT IS SO IMPORTANT THAT WE GO FORWARD THINKING IN THAT. AND AS THEY SAID IF WE BUILD IT THEY SHALL COME. INFRASTRUCTURE IS. DESPERATELY NEEDED WE'VE GOT TO INCLUDE THAT. IN OUR FUTURE HERE IN CALIFORNIA THANK YOU MANAGER. THANK YOU CENTER TO LET AND WE WILL BE HEARING A NEXT FROM INNER PANEL FROM. THE PORT OF LONG BEACH- WHO MAY BE ABLE TO SPEAK A BIT MORE ON THE HYDROGEN HAVE AS WELL. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FIGURE THE PANELISTS- AT LET ME BUILD ON. COUPLE MY COLLEAGUES. REMARKS QUESTIONS. MISTER BROWN MENTIONED. THE IMPORTANCE OF TECHNOLOGY NEUTRALITY- AND THE WILLINGNESS OF US AS A BODY AND I SUPPOSE BEYOND US LIKE TO INCLUDE. THE VARIOUS COMMISSIONS. TO MAKE DETERMINATIONS AT WHAT POINT DOES IT MAKE SENSE TO FOCUS. ON A SPECIFIC TECHNOLOGY I GUESS BY INFERENCE- TURN AWAY FROM CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY SO- COMMISSION MONTANA I'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT RECENTLY ABOUT. HYDROGEN DIED IN THE STATE'S. AT LEAST A SPOUSE POLICIES NEEDS NEUTRALITY ACROSS BOTH PLATFORMS FUEL CELL AND BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES. AT BY THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'VE MADE IN THE REST OF THE CREW THAT NEED TO BE MADE- ARE MASSIVE- IF WE'RE GONNA GET FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGY. WHETHER LIGHT OR HEAVY DUTY. AT A LEVEL THAT'S COMPETITIVE WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES SO HOW DO WE AS A LEGISLATURE AND ALL OF THE BLOOD THROUGH THE SET TO ANY DETAILS. THINK ABOUT. OUR ROLE IN ALLOCATING FUNDS ACROSS IS VERY LONG LEAD TIMES WHERE IT MAY BECOME APPARENT. TO SOME OR PERHAPS ALL THAT ONE. OR THE OTHER OF THESE TWO PLATFORMS IS NOT NO LONGER JUST TRIES INVESTMENT. SENATOR NEWMAN- WITHOUT DIRECTED TO ANYONE SPECIFIC LET ME START WITH THE L. A. O. AND THEN I'D I'D LOVE TO HEAR- FROM. THE FROM CORPUS WELL THANK YOU AND WE'LL START WITH- MISTER ROSS BROWN FROM THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RELATED TO THE TECHNICALITY QUESTION FOR MR US SENATOR NEWMAN. YEAH SENATOR NEWMAN AT I THINK IT'S- A GROUP OF A VERY GOOD QUESTION AND I UNFORTUNATELY I THINK MY WRIST MY RESPONSE WILL NOT BE. A PARTICULARLY SATISFYING FOR YOU I MEAN I THINK IT'S- THEY KIND OF. WHEN THE KIND OF QUESTION A DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGY AND KIND OF WHERE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES ARE- IS A VERY KIND OF TECHNICAL QUESTION AND SO I THINK- YOU'RE GETTING SORT OF THE INPUT FROM OUR STATE'S ENERGY AGENCIES THAT HAVE THAT KIND OF TECHNICAL EXPERTISE I THINK IT IS- INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT AND AS YOU POINTED OUT THE- MAKING SURE THAT KIND OF THAT INFORMATION IS KIND OF GETTING BACK UP TO THE LEGISLATURE AND HELPING SORT OF INFORMED ITS DECISIONS ABOUT. BUDGET ALLOCATIONS- AND YOU KNOW AS YOU SAID FOR A VERY LARGE INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENTS AND ENSURING THAT THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE STRANDED BUT ALSOTHAT THE- THE STATE IT'S KIND OF SUPPORTING SOME OF THE TECHNOLOGY TECHNOLOGICAL NEUTRALITY- WE THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SO I APOLOGIZE I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO GO OUT AND GIVE YOU SORT OF A DEFINITIVE ANSWER ON EXACTLY HOW TO DO THAT BUT WE DO THINK THAT'S KIND OF AN IMPORTANT ISSUE TO EXPLORE AND- PARTICULAR EXPLODED MINISTRATION ISSUE AND THINK ABOUT. IT GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU MUCH OF. AND JUST IF WE COULD ALSO FROM- FROM THAT AREA. BORDERS ONE. THANK YOU TO RANDOLPH SURE- AND- I'M SURE COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN ALSO HAS A LOT TO ADD ON ON THIS ISSUE AS WELL I DON'T EVEN KNOW AT THIS OINT WE ARE MOVING AS AS FAST AS WE CAN AND AS HARD AS WE CAN TOWARDS A ZERO EMISSION FUTURE AND I THINK WE'RE NOT AT THE POINT YET WHERE WE SHOULD BE TAKING OPTIONS OFF THE TABLE- RIGHT NOW OUR AN INCENTIVE PROGRAMS DO INCENTIVIZE- BOTH HAD BATTERY ELECTRIC AND FUEL CELL OPTIONS. AND AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE AND TO- INSURE THAT OUR- HYDROGEN PRODUCTION GETS GREENER AND LOWER CARBON- HAS AS WE MOVE FORWARD- SO I THINK AND I THINK THERE'S STILL A ROLE FOR- UP ALL TECHNOLOGIES AS WE CONTINUE TO MAKE THIS TRANSITION. AND THANK YOU CHAIR READ SO GOD CHAIR MONAGHAN HAD DE I WOULD NOT PUT IT TO YOU WHAT WATCH IT WOULD BE THINKING ABOUT INVESTMENTS IF AND WHEN THE STATE GETS BEYOND THE CURRENTLY FUNDED HUNDREDS OF LIKE TO THE HYDRANT STATIONS AS WELL AS THE SMALL NUMBER. OF MEAT MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY STATIONS WE HAVE. WHAT WE HAVE A STATE GOAL HAVE TO. STATION OKAY BY TWO TWENTY AND WE'RE TARGETING OUR INVESTMENTS TO BE ABLE TO REACH THAT GOAL- WITH LAST YEAR'S BUDGET WE SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDING TO HAVE TWO HUNDRED. OPEN RETAIL HYDROGEN STATIONS. THOSE STATIONS WHICH AS I SAID THIRTEEN. CAN HOPEFULLY MORE WILL HAVE THE CAPABILITY TO REFUEL BIG SENSE AS WELL AS PASSENGER VEHICLES- AND THAT'S A GOOD POINT FOR US TO YOU KNOW TO SEE HOW WELL WE'RE TIGHT TRADING. THE INFRASTRUCTURE TO THE ACTUAL VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT SO THOSE STATIONS SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH. CASSIDY TO REFUEL CLOSE TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES THAT'S NEARLY FIVE TIMES WHAT INDUSTRY EXPECTS TO HAVE ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX SO THAT THAT WOULD BE A GOOD OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO SORT OF EVALUATE. DOES THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEED MEAT WHAT WE'RE SEEING IN TERMS OF THE MARKET- AND AS I SAID IN MY POINTS I THINK YOU KNOW WE'VE WE FACE SOME HYDROGEN SHORTAGES WE FACE SOME. LIKE BREAKDOWN OF EQUIPMENT THAT WAS HARD TO FIX WHEN IT CAME TO THE STATIONS THEMSELVES BECAUSE OF THE NASCENT. NATURE OF THE OF THE STATION TECHNOLOGY- AND SO AS- THE MARKET EXPANDS. WE ASSUME SOME OF THOSE ROAD BLOCKS ARE GOING TO GO DOWN WE'RE WORKING ACTIVELY TO OVERCOME THOSE ROADBLOCKS BUT- I THINK THAT THAT FOR US IS. IS A MOMENT TO KIND OF EVALUATE WHAT WHERE ARE WE AND- THIS WE HAVE REPORTS THAT WE DO- ANNUALLY WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD IN CHARGE OUR JOINT AGENCIES WILL. WILL COME UP WITH SORT OF AN ASSESSMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS ON ON HOW WELL WE'RE DOING IN TERMS OF MATCHING. INFRASTRUCTURE WITH THE NEED. I DO APPRECIATE AN EXTRA CREDIT FOR USE THE WORD TIE TRADING. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN US SENATOR ALAN. THANK YOU SO MUCH THE PANEL FOR A VERY INTERESTING DISCUSSION- I YOU KNOW I'M I'M I KNOW WE'VE BEEN KIND OF TOUCHING UPON THE SOMEWHAT THROUGH THE PANEL BUT- YOU THIS WHOLE QUESTION OF. WAITING FOR ZERO EMISSION HEAVY DUTY TACK TO COME ONLINE IN A SERIOUS WAY VERSES NEAR ZERO EMISSION ANOTHER PEOPLE FEEL REALLY STRONGLY ABOUT THIS ON EITHER SIDES- I'D JUST LIKE TO GET MORE- MORE OF A SENSE FROM FROM FOLKS- IT MAY MAY MAYBE THE MAYBE THAT THAT THE GERMAN FROM THE- THE AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT THE SOUTH COAST. I CAN JUST GIVE US A SENSE OF HOW HE- THINKS ABOUT THE WING OF THAT CHALLENGE- YOU KNOW THE PERMITTING OF INTER MINUTE OPTION OF NEAR ZERO HEAVY DUTY TACK. MAYBE OTHER PANELS MIGHT HAVE ADDITIONAL PARTS OF THE ONE ADD INTO THAT THAT QUESTION. THANK YOU IF I MAY ADD ON THAT THAT'S A QUESTION THAT I HAD AS WELL SPECIFIC TO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS- BECAUSE I THINK THERE WAS A- STRATEGY HORIZON THAT I HEARD FROM- EXECUTIVE OFFICE OFFICER MISATO ABOUT SEVEN TO TEN YEARS. WHILE WE'RE ALSO DEVELOPING ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES SIMULTANEOUSLY SO. I'D LIKE TO KNOW IF THAT'S STILL THE FACT IS THAT IS THAT STILL THE CASE- AND I THINK TWO. OF THE SENATORS POINT AS WELL AS HOW ELSE WE CAN BE THINKING ABOUT- THE- IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY- AT THE SAME TIME BECAUSE I THINK OUR COMMUNITIES DON'T UNDERSTAND WHERE THIS IS ALL HEADED AND THERE'S A LOT OF EVERYONE PUTTING THEIR STAKE IN THE GROUND AS ZERO EMISSION VERSUS NEAR ZERO AND IT'S BECOME VERY COMPLEX FOR MOST OF THE PUBLIC. APOLOGY SENATOR ALAN FOR TAKING THAT OVER BUT I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME TEACHERS TO THINK YOU SO MUCH- MISTER MUSETTO. THANK YOU. MADAM AND SENATOR ALAN THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SO I JUST WANT TO TRY TO MAKE IT CLEAR IS THAT WE ARE COMPLETELY ON BOARD. WITH THE STATE ON ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES. BUT THE SAD FACT OF THE MATTER IS THEY'RE JUST NOT AVAILABLE IN LARGE VYING SURVEIL OF ALL. IN SMALL FARMS AND FOR THE SMALL VEHICLES. RIGHT BUT IF YOU WANT A BIG TRUCK PULLING CARGO AT THE PORTS. IN ORDER TO GET TO THE THOUSANDS OF TRUCKS THAT WE NEED IT'S GONNA TAKE TIME I THINK IT COMMISSIONER MON HAD NOTED THAT. INFRASTRUCTURE TAKES TIME- AND SO I YOU KNOW WE ARE A GREAT STATE WE CAN. CHEW GUM AND WALK AT THE SAME TIME SO OUR POSITION IS THAT. WE SHOULD BE SAVING LIVES TODAY. BY PUTTING OUT A CLEANER TECHNOLOGY IS COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE IN LARGE NUMBERS THAT'S ALREADY ROLLING DOWN PRODUCTION LINES. ON THE EAST COAST. WE CAN CLEAN THE AIR WHILE WE PLAN FOR THEIR ZERO EMISSION FUTURE. AND WORK AND WE'RE TRYING TO DO THAT LOCALLY BUT YOU KNOW ONE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE PREVIOUS- CENTER **** HOW SHOULD THEY DISTRIBUTE THE FUNDS AND WE BELIEVE THE FUNDS SHOULD BE DISTRIBUTED. AT THAT PROVIDES THE MOST EMISSIONS BENEFIT THE BILL DECISION SHOULD BE HOW MANY LIVES CAN I SAVE WITH THIS THIS FUNDING. AND SO I THINK WITH THIS GREAT SURPLUS WE SHOULD DO BUT WE SHOULD PLAN FOR ZERO EMISSIONS AT. TECHNOLOGY FUTURE WHILE WE CLEAN THE AIR TODAY AND LET'S NOT FORGET WE'RE UNDER FEDERAL MANDATE I MEAN THESE ARE FEDERAL GUIDELINES. IT'S A REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE TO FULFILL. SO EVEN THOUGH WE WON'T GET ALL THE WAY THERE YOUR PLACE EVERY TRUCK WITH THE END USER TECHNOLOGY. IT'LL GET US PRETTY CLOSE. AND WE'RE CLEANING UP THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH YOU KNOW I DON'T CHAIR CAN I ADDRESS THIS YES PLEASE DROWNED OFF. THANK YOU. I GUESS I WOULD NOTE A COUPLE THINGS- I MEAN I THINK. WE NEED TO BE MOVING AWAY FROM COMBUSTION AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE- AND SO WOW WE DO HAVE PROGRAMS THAT INSTEAD DO SO INCENTIVIZE NATURAL GAS VEHICLES. I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT THAT AS WE ARE AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO MAKE HIS STORY INVESTMENT IN THE FUTURE. THAT WE FOCUS ON A FUTURE WITHOUT COMBUSTION. AND I WILL NOTE THAT NATURAL GAS TRUCKS DO DETERIORATED PERFORMANCE OVER TIME IN TERMS OF THEIR KNOCKS EMISSIONS SO WE NEED TO KEEP THAT IN MIND. THAT TRUCKS WE ARE PUTTING ON THE ROAD TODAY WILL BE ON THE ROAD FOR MANY MANY YEARS TO COME. SO AS WE THINK ABOUT THE DOLLARS THAT WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO ALLOCATE OUR THE U. S. THE LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY TO ALLOCATE YOU WANT TO BE ALLOCATING THOSE DOLLARS TOWARDS THE FUTURE AND THE FUTURE IS ZERO. THANK YOU CHAIR RANDOLPH APPRECIATE THAT AS WELL AS- WE HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION FROM SENATOR RUBIO. THANK YOU KNOW AND I STEPPED IN A LITTLE BIT LATE I HOPE THAT I'M NOT ASKING SOMETHING ALREADY SHARED BY TOP YOU KNOW WE'RE JUST HEARING HOW CONFUSING IT IS AS A LEGISLATURE AND- AND JUST YOU KNOW HOW COMPLEX THE ISSUE IS AND I'M JUST COMING FROM LOCAL GOVERNMENT I'M JUST. WONDERING I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SEVERAL PROGRAMS WERE CREATED RECENTE- CAN YOU DESCRIBE SOME OF THE PROGRAMS FOR LOCAL COVER BANDS THAT ARE TRYING TO TRANSITION THEIR OWN VEHICLES- AND THEIR SLEET OP WHAT. WHAT PROGRAMS ARE ARE OUT THERE THAT YOU CAN DESCRIBE. FOR THESE PROGRAMS FOR FLEETS ARE. JUST IN. THE GOVERNMENT SO FOR EXAMPLE A LOT OF THE MARKET RIGHT NOW ARE TRANSITIONING THEIR THEIR- PUBLIC WORKS FLEET. ANYTHING THAT THEY CAN SHARE. RIGHT NOW WHAT ARE THEY WORKING TOWARDS EDUCATING OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND BRING THEM ALONG BECAUSE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FEDERAL MANDATES STATE MANDATES. NOW WE HAVE THESE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE. SOMETIMES ASKING FOR HELP AND SO I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY'RE BRINGING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS ALONG. YES AND THAT'S THERE'S A MULTITUDE OF PROGRAMS BUT I. WILL HAVE A COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN RESPOND. YES THE RUBIO THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION- ONE OF THE- FLAGSHIP PROGRAMS THAT- WERE FUNDING IS WITH A GROUP CALLED CAL START THERE ACTUALLY. OF SUPPORTING CARP ON VEHICLES CENTERS IN THEIR SPRING ENERGY COMMISSION ON INFRASTRUCTURE INCENTIVES. AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR. FLEETS LIKE LOCAL LOCAL LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLEASE AS WELL TO BE ABLE TO. EASILY ACCESS FUNDING FOR BOTH. THE VEHICLE INCENTIVES AND FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE INCENTIVES. THROUGH THE THROUGH THE CAL STAR PROGRAM SO THAT'S ONE OF THE FUNDING- OPPORTUNITIES THAT EXIST TODAY AND I THINK A GOOD EXAMPLE OF HOW. WE'RE TRYING TO GO FORTH WITH THE ONE GOVERNMENT APPROACH I MEAN THERE RESOURCES BOARD ANY ENERGY COMMISSION WE DON'T WANT GRANTEES TO VIEW THIS AS LIKE A CONFUSING EXPERIENCE WHERE YOU HAVE. LIKE WIDELY DIFFERENT REQUIREMENTS DEPENDING ON WHICH AGENCIES FUNDING WE WANT TO MAKE IT SUPER EASY FOR DIFFERENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND FLEETS TO BE ABLE TO. YET ZERO EMISSION REQUIREMENTS AND TO GET THE REFUELING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IT. BUT I HEAR YOU WE I MEAN WE NEED TO DO MORE TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH THE COMMISSION MONAGHAN AND THE CENTER TO IT IF YOU HAVE ONE FINAL QUESTION BECAUSE- WE'RE GONNA FOLLOW UP ON THAT WOULD AGREE QUESTION BY MY COLLEAGUE- HYPOTHETICALLY A SMALL CITY IN ANYONE OF OUR DISTRICT IN CALIFORNIA. CAN THEY OBTAIN A GRANT FROM YOUR AGENCY TO- BUILD OF A SMALL INFRASTRUCTURE AND THEN PERHAPS EVEN PURCHASE OF SOME FROM VEHICLES TO BE A PART OF THE CITY- TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM. AND COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND- RESPOND PLEASE YEAH I ARE YOU KNOW GRANT PROGRAMS ARE STRUCTURED TO HELP- BUT TRUCK OWNERS AND I YOU KNOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO MY TEAM ACTUALLY AND REALLY DIVE DEEPER INTO THIS QUESTION OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT SUPPORT. I MEAN I THINK IT'S A REALLY. IMPORTANT ONE YEAH WE HAVE SPECIFIC TARGETS AROUND TRANSIT BUSES SCHOOL BUSES STRAIGHT DRAYAGE TRUCKS- YOU KNOW BUT THAT REAL STRONG FOCUS ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND WHAT MORE WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT THEM AS THEY- ZERO OUT EMISSIONS I THINK THAT'S A GREAT ONE. WE HAVE FUNDED AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION THESEPLANNING GRANTS TO LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HELP THEM FIGURE OUT HOW TO- WE DON'T THEIR PLANS FOR BUILDING OUT ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INFRASTRUCTURE AND WE FUNDED SOME OF THE IMPLEMENTATION. OF THOSE PLANS- YOU KNOW BUT WHAT MORE WE CAN DO TO BRING BOTH THE VEHICLE INCENTIVES AND THE INFRASTRUCTURE INCENTIVES TOGETHER TO SUPPORT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD EXPLORE MORE DEEPLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU SENATOR ARCHULETA WE APPRECIATE THAT AND WE I WANT TO THANK THE PANEL OF THE FIRST PANEL FOR WONDERFUL PRESENTATIONS WONDERFUL RESPONSES. I KNOW THERE WILL BE A LOT MORE QUESTIONS AND WE'LL CERTAINLY CHECK IN WITH YOU PERSONALLY SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M NEVER GOING TO MOVE ON TO PANEL NUMBER TWO AND I APPRECIATE THE PATIENCE OF THOSE OF THE STAKEHOLDER GROUP. A PANEL TO WE'RE GONNA START OFF WITH MISTER ANGELO LOGAN POLICY AND CAMPAIGN DIRECTOR. FOR MOVING FORWARD NETWORK. THANK YOU TERRY DOLLARS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- FOR INVITING ME TO CHECK I. YOU TODAY. AMANDA LOGAN I AM WITH THE MOVING FOR NETWORK WHICH IS A NETWORK OF FIFTY FIVE ORGANIZATIONS ARE COUNTRY WORKING ON. PRE TRANSPORTATION MARMONTEL. I MEAN JUST THAT. ALSO READ OF LONG BEACH CALIFORNIA JUST. GOING FROM THE BOARD COMPLEX. SITUATION TO TEN. ADDED HAVE THE MONEY AVAILABLE AT WRITTEN OUT BUT I HEARING THE- GREAT PANEL. A KIND OF POP MUSIC KIND OF JUST REALLY. IN TO SOME OF THE WHITE REALLY HARD HITTING ISSUES. FIRST I THINK IT'S CLEAR. THAT- WE ALL UNDERSTAND. THE IMPACT OF TRANSPORTATION AND WHAT- IMPACT THAT HAS ON THE CLIMATE CRISIS. AND ON LOCAL COMMUNITIES. AND A TOXIC EXPOSURE TO THE COMMUTER ALONG QUITE FOUR DOLLARS WHETHER ACTION NO LONGER SEVEN TEN FREEWAY. IN BAGUIO LOGIN INFO DIEGO. OUR WEST SPOKESMAN. NEAR THE PARK OPEN. IT. CRITICAL THAT WE TRANSITION TO A MEASURE. AS RAPIDLY AS PART. NOT JUST FOR RESULT IN THE COMING. BUT RESULT IN THE PUBLIC HOW CRISIS THAT ARE CA. ARE WHEN. IF YOU LOOK AT THE TEN. HERE MANY THAT ARE THAT THOSE. THURMOND SERIES OF CANCER FAT BUT TO DO THAT I LIVE IN HAVE TO HAVE A- THAT FOCUSES ON WE ARE. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARE. THAT'S GREATER THEY ARE. WE SHOULDN'T HAVE TO BE ABOUT THAT AND YOUR MONEY RESOURCES. ARE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING THAT IS PART. I DOLLARS BUT THEN WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE INVESTMENT. THAT WILL BE MAKING OF THEIR CREW INVESTMENTS ARE NOT JUST. YOU KNOW STRATEGICALLY PLACED AND PLANNED TO MEET PARTICULAR OUTCOMES THAT ARE KIND OF- FABRICATED IN SOME WAYS. I I'M ALLUDING TO THE CLEAN AIR ACT IN THE NEXT DOWNTURN THAT THE BILLS ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE MEET THE LOCALS AND THOSE REQUIREMENTS. BUT THERE ARE CERTAIN POLLUTANTS THAT ARCH I'M REGULATED UNDER THOSE. THING FIVE CULTURE FINE PARTICLES THAT ARE TOXIC BY PURE PARTICLES ARE IMPORTANT TO ELIMINATE IN OUR COMMUNITIES EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT REGULATED UNDER THE- THE NATIONAL AIR AT AMBIENT AIR QUALITY STANDARDS. OUR COMMUNITIES DESERVE CLEAN AIR THEY DESERVE ZERO POLLUTION AND SO- MORE THINKING ABOUT THESE INVESTMENT OF THE LIMITED DOLLARS I THINK ABOUT WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF THOSE COMMUNITIES ALONG THE FREIGHT CORRIDORS. AND IF WE WERE TO THINK ABOUT JUST IN BACK IN IN. THOSE CORRIDORS WITH THE EQUIPMENT THAT MOVE GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE YOU KNOW WE WOULDN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO JUST INVEST IN THOSE VERY LOCALIZED AREAS LIKE GRADE STRUCTURE. LIKE LOCOMOTIVES LIKE CARGO AND EQUIPMENT LIKE CONTROLLING- SHIP EMISSIONS. MY CONTENTION IS THAT WE REALLY CARE ABOUT OUR LOCAL COMMUNITIES WE CARE ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE WE NEED TO INVEST IN THOSE COMMUNITIES FIRST AND FOREMOST MAKE SURE THAT WE GET TO THEIR- POLLUTION. BECAUSE THEIR ROLE- EMISSIONS AND INTERNAL COMBUSTION UNFORTUNATELY WHEN WE INVEST IN INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE LIKE NATURAL GAS. AND WE SET UP A FIFTY M. AND INFRASTRUCTURE FOR YEARS AND YEARS TO COME THAT IN MY MIND IT'S NOT A TRUE INVESTMENT. INVESTMENT IS SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT THE LONG TERM AND BY THE TIME WE TRANSITION OUT OF. COMBUSTION VEHICLES YOU KNOW THERE'S GENERATIONS OF CHILDREN THAT HAVE DEVELOPED AND THEIR LONG HAVE DEVELOPED AND UNDER DEVELOPED BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE TO- CULTUREFINDER AND COMBUSTION. MISSION THE OTHER AREA THAT I TO- PLAN IS THAT WE ARE. IN A GROWTH PATTERN TERMS OF THREE FOR. AND PRAY TRAFFIC WE SEE AN EXPLOSION OF WAREHOUSE WHICH- AN EXPOSURE OF THROUGHPUT THE TWO WE IT. OF FREEWAYS AND THEM OF TRUCKS THERE GOING TO OUR NEIGHBOR. SO WHAT WILL ONE BASS WE WANT MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT. ONE FORWARD INTO BACK ESPECIALLY WE'RE TRYING TO PRODUCTION WHEN WE ARE IF WE ARE TO INVEST IN- NATURAL GAS VEHICLES- AND WE ARE GOING TO DEPEND ON THE PRODUCTION OF NATURAL GAS AT THE SAME TIME. OTHER ARMS ARE TRYING TO ELIMINATE PRODUCTION OF OIL AND GAS IN COMMUNITIES WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TAKING ONE STEP TWO STEPS BACKWARD. THANK YOU MAY LOGIN AND IF YOU CAN WRAP UP THAT WOULD BE GREAT THANK YOU SO MUCH WHAT THE- THE WHERE AMERICAN PUBLIC DOLLARS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE- INSURING THE INVESTMENT IN ZERO EMISSION THE POT. WAIT AUTOMATION SO THAT WE DO NOT ELIMINATE JOBS AT THE PORT CARE ON THE DOCK AND THAT WE MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT PERPETUATING- THE- MISS CLASSIFICATION OF DRIVERS- OF GRADES TRUXTON AND WAREHOUSE WORKERS AS WE INVEST PUBLIC DOLLARS FOR PUBLIC THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS. AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AS WELL. NEXT UP OUR P. NUMBER. IS HEATHER TIMELY THE MANAGING DIRECTOR OF PLANNING ENVIRONMENTAL PLAN. OF THE DIRECTOR OF INVER PLANNING ME OF LONG BEACH- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US MISS TIMELY. WELCOME YOU MAY GO AHEAD. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M HEATHER TIMELY WITH THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. THE POOR IS BEEN DEEPLY ENGAGED FOR MANY YEARS WITH OUR INDUSTRY PARTNERS IN THE COMMUNITY ON THE DRIVE TO ZERO EMISSIONS FOR BOTH ON ROAD HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS AND OFF ROAD TERMINAL EQUIPMENT. OR IMPLEMENTING STRATEGIES TO IMPROVE AIR QUALITY AND REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS AND ALIGNMENT WITH THE STATE. I MEAN ESTABLISH CLOSE TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS FOR TERMINAL EQUIPMENT BY TWENTY THIRTY AND TRUCKS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. BUT IF WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL WE CAN'T UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF EFFORT AND THE AMOUNT OF WORK STILL REQUIRED TO GET. HERE TWO MAIN AREAS OF FOCUS EACH WITH THEIR OWN ST OF CHALLENGES. FIRST DEVELOPING THE VEHICLES AND EQUIPMENT. OPERATING REQUIREMENTS TO SUPPORT FOR TRADITIONALLY OPERATED MAN'S TERMINAL EQUIPMENT AND ON ROAD HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS ARE SEVERE. THESE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES HAVE TO BE RELIABLE AND POWERFUL WITH HIGH CAPACITY BATTERIES ARE ADEQUATE FUEL STORAGE. AND EXTENDED RANGE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL TECHNOLOGIES HAVE PROMISED THAT DEVELOPMENT ESPECIALLY FOR OPERATE EQUIPMENT IS FURTHER BEHIND. TODAY'S YOUR MISSION YOUR CALL REPLACEMENTS THAT CAN MEET THE RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS SUPPORT WORK AREN'T FEASIBLE FOR MOST APPLICATIONS. WE'VE BEEN DEVELOPING AND SUPPORTING NUMEROUS PROJECTS TO ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES THAT TERMINALS AND ON THE ROADS. AND PROJECT PARTNERS HAVE LEARNED A LOT THROUGH THESE DEMONSTRATIONS. SOME OF THIS EQUIPMENT IS IN ITS THIRD GENERATION AND IMPORTANT IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE. BUT THEY AREN'T READY YET. SOME TERMINALS AND HANDED EQUIPMENT BACK AFTER DEMONSTRATIONS INCLUDE BECAUSE THEY DON'T MEET THEIR OPERATIONAL NEEDS. WE BELIEVE IT WILL STILL BE SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE THESE VEHICLES ARE FULLY FEASIBLE. AND LASTLY THE COSCO ZERO EMISSION TERMINAL EQUIPMENT AS AT LEAST THREE TIMES THE COST OF EACH SO ON AVERAGE. AND PROGRESS WELL FINANCED INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATOR TRUCKERS. THEY'REGOING TO NEED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SUPPORT GIVEN THE COST FOR ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS CAN BE TEN TIMES MORE THAN WHAT THEY'RE USED TO PAYING. SECOND BUILDING OUT THE CHARGING AND FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE. ARGUABLY THIS WILL BE MUCH MORE COMPLEX AND CHALLENGING THAN THE EQUIPMENT DEVELOPMENT. INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND DESTRUCTIVE HUMAN STRONG. AND THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE STILL EMERGING THERE'S A NEED TO FUTURE PROOF INFRASTRUCTURE TO ACCOMMODATE FOR ADVANCEMENT SUCH AS HIGHER CAPACITY BATTERIES AND- CHARGERS TO COME ONLINE. A REGIONAL NETWORK OF CHARGING AND FUELING MUST BE BUILT FROM SCRATCH TO SUPPORT THE THIRTEEN THOUSAND PLUS ACTIVE DRAINAGE TRUCKS SERVING THE SAN PEDRO BAY PORTS. MULTIPLE STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING UTILITIES. LEN GOVERNMENT AND PRIVATE ENDED WHEN THE TO PLAY FOR AND DEVELOP IT AND WE KNOW FROM. THAT DESIGN CAN CAN MANY YEARS. EVER STRUCTURE ALSO BE BUILT WITH ACT AND MINE. PUBLIC CHARGING FUELING WILL BE ESSENTIAL AND WILL REQUIRE SUBSIDIES TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE ESPECIALLY IN THE EARLY YEARS. FURTHER RELIANCE ON THE ELECTRICAL GRID NEXT TO SOLVE HONORABLE TWO OUTAGES AND REQUIRES ENERGY RESILIENCY STRATEGIES. AND FINALLY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS MUST CONTINUE TO PUSH FOR PROGRESS BUT ALSO SET REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS SO OPERATORS CAN COMPLY AND OUR ECONOMY CAN CONTINUE TO THRIVE. WE CAN ACHIEVING ZERO EMISSIONS FUTURE WE REMAIN CLEAR FOCUSED AND MAKE A DELIBERATE EFFORT TO ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISS TOMMY APPRECIATED YOU ARE RIGHT ON TIME AT THREE MINUTES SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PATIENCE AND THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH US AS WELL- NEXT WE HAVE. AT THE SUPERSEAL SENIOR ADVOCATE FOR IN OUR DC THE NATIONAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL WELCOME. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR GONZALEZ AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS BUCKY SUPPORT YEAR WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU ALL TODAY. ZEROCHAN VEHICLES ARE MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES ARE ALREADY GETTING OUR ROADS. THE TECHNOLOGY IS IMPROVING BY LEAPS AND BOUNDS. TODAY THERE ARE DOZENS OF MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY ELECTRIC TRUCK MODELS. EITHER AVAILABLE OR COMING TO MARKET IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. MOREOVER MANUFACTURERS ARE CONSTANTLY INNOVATING AND IMPROVING THEIR PRODUCTS. AND FLEETS WANT ZERO EMISSION GIVE. THEIR SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL FUEL AND MAINTENANCE COSTS SAVINGS. BECAUSE OF THE SAVINGS MANY ELECTRIC TRUCKS AND BUSES ARE ALREADY COMPETITIVE ON THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP BASIS. TODAY I'M ONLY BECOME MORE COMPETITIVE. AS BATTERY PRICES DECLINE ECONOMIES OF SCALE IMPROVE. THE TECHNOLOGY MATURES. THIS IS WHY WE'RE SEEING LITERALLY BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PRE ORDERS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS. FROM COMPANIES INCLUDING AMAZON AND UPS AND FEDEX. THAT'S THE VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY BUT LET'S TALK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE SPECIFICALLY FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES. MEETING THE CHARGING NEEDS OF BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IS TECHNICALLY AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE AND ALREADY HAPPENING. SUBSTANTIAL FUNDS HAVE BEEN UNLOCKED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE BY THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND ENERGY COMMISSION PROGRAMS AND LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD. MEANWHILE THE THREE LARGEST ELECTRIC. INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES THAT SERVE ROUGHLY THREE QUARTERS OF THE STATE ARE PROVED TO COLLECTIVELY INVEST OVER SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION IN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND THIS IS THE FIRST TRANCHE OF FUNDING. SO THAT'S THE GOOD NEWS BUT WE CAN'T CLOSE OUR EYES TO THE REALITY THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLES STILL HAVE HIGH UP FRONT COSTS. MOREOVER EXPLOITATIVE BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT ARE RAMPANT IN THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY SUCH AS DRIVERS CLASSIFICATION. MAKE IT DIFFICULT FOR DRIVERS TO UPGRADE TO CLEANER TECHNOLOGY. XCELERATED RAPID ELECTRIFICATION INCENTIVES TO HELP FLEETS TRANSITION ZERO MISSION ARE IMPERATIVE BUT SO TOO ARE POLICIES THAT ADDRESS BUSINESS PRACTICES IT SHOULD HAVE COST TO DRIVERS. ALSO NONTECHNICAL CHALLENGES AROUND PLANNING PERMITTING AND COSTS TO REMAIN ON YOUR STRUCTURE SO. ROUGH TO A GOOD START BUT A LOT MORE IS NEEDED. HOWEVER PUBLIC HOWEVER BECAUSE PUBLIC FUNDING IS SO LIMITED WE SHOULD ONLY BE SPENDING ON THE OUTCOME WE NEED. ZERO TAILPIPE EMISSIONS NATURAL GAS VEHICLES ARE ANTIQUATED SECOND BEST SOLUTION IT SHOULD NOT BE SUPPORT. IT WILL PERPETUATE OUR RELIANCE ON FOSSIL FUELS RESULT IN STRANDED ASSETS AND INCREASE EMISSIONS. PROMOTING THE SALE OF NATURAL GAS VEHICLES ALSO PROMOTES THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT RELIES ON. THIS INFRASTRUCTURE ASIDE FROM BEING RIFE WITH LEAKS AND EMISSIONS ARE LONG LIFE CAPITAL ASSETS MOREOVER NATURAL GAS EMISSIONS OCCUR THROUGHOUT THE FUEL SUPPLY CHAIN BEGINNING TAILPIPE BENEFITS. LASTLY PRELIMINARY RESULTS FROM AN ONGOING TWO HUNDRED TRUCK EMISSIONS STUDY SHOWS THAT NATURAL GAS TRUCKS EMIT SIGNIFICANTLY MORE KNOCKS IN THE REAL WORLD IN THEIR LAB CERTIFICATION RATE. AND THEIR MISSION CONTROL SYSTEMS DEGRADE RAPIDLY OVER TIME. IN SOME INSTANCES CAUSING THEM TO POLLUTE ABOVE THEIR DIESEL COUNTERPARTS. IN COMPARISON ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE THE ONLY TECHNOLOGY THE GETS CLEANER AS THEY AGE THEY PLUG INTO AN INCREASINGLY CLEAN ELECTRICITY GRID. THAT'S WHAT GUYS VEHICLES MUST NOT BE VIEWED AS A CLIMATE OR CLEAN AIR STRATEGY. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. WITH YOU TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD TO ANSWERING YOUR QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR PUT BRP. ARE WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WE HAVE THE PANELIST A MISTER CHRISTIAN MOTOR SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT OF GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS. FOR CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION THANK YOU MISTER SHE MOTIVE FOR JOINING US WELCOME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CHRISTIAN MOTOR WITH A CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S HEARING. GOODS MOVEMENT IS ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S ESSENTIAL INDUSTRIES SUPPORTING ONE THIRD OF THE STATE'S ECONOMY AND JOBS TRUCKING IS THE IRREPLACEABLE LINKING CALIFORNIA SUPPLY CHAIN LEVINE OVER 80% OF ALL GETS LIKE GROCERIES MEDICINES. CONSTRUCTION AND MANUFACTURING MATERIALS E-COMMERCE AND EVERYTHING IN BETWEEN. TO MEET THESE DEMANDS TRUCKERS DEPLOYED THE FIRST SET OF VEHICLES SERVING DOZENS OF UNIQUE USE CASES INCLUDED IN THE COMMITTEE'S MATERIALS IS A CHART WHICH OUTLINES THE BROAD RANGE OF TRUCKS USED IN THE INDUSTRY. CLASS TO BE CARGO VANS TO LARGE CLASS EIGHT TRACTORS AT THE STATE CONSIDERS A TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS WE RECOMMEND FOCUSING ON THOSE USE CASES BEST SUITED FOR TODAY'S TECHNOLOGY. SPECIFICALLY SMALLER CLASS TO BE THREE FIVE VEHICLES THAT RETURNED TO A CENTRALIZED LOCATION AND CAN CHARGER FUEL OVERNIGHT. AS BATTERING VEHICLE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES THIS TYPE OF OPERATION PRIMARILY FOUND IN THE FINAL MILE DELIVERY SPACE SHOULD OVERCOME MANY OF THE BARRIERS POSED BY ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY NAMELY LIMITED RANGE INCREASE WEIGHTS LACK OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND CHARGING DOWNSIDE. FONG FINAL MILE DELIVERY VEHICLES TYPICALLY OPERATE LOCALLY RUN OUT OF CARGO SPACE BEFORE WAIT YOU CAN UTILIZE THE PRO CHARGING OVER AN EIGHT TO TEN HOUR PERIOD WHICH LESSENS GREAT IMPACT. FOR LARGER CLASS SEVENTY TRACTORS WILL BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME THESE LIMITATIONS. TRACTORS REGULARLY TRAVEL IN EXCESS OF THREE HUNDRED MILES PER DAY EXCEEDING THE RANGE OF TODAY'S ELECTRIC TRUCKS BATTERIES CAN ADDED SIXTY EIGHT THOUSAND POUNDS TO THE WEIGHT OF A TRACTOR REDUCING CARGO CAPACITY BY FIFTEEN PERCENT. THE GREAT IMPACT OF CLASS SEVEN EIGHT TRACTORS WILL ALSO BE MUCH GREATER IN THE COMMITTEES MATERIALS IS A COMPARISON BETWEEN THE POWER DRAW FINAL MILE DELIVERY VEHICLES AND LARGER TRUCKS. ENERGY COMMISSION HAS ESTIMATED THAT THE SIXTEEN THOUSAND CLASS EIGHT TRACTORS SERVING SEVEN CALIFORNIA'S PORTS ALONE. COULD GENERATE UP TO A GIGGLE WATER PEAK LOAD. THESE TRUCKS COMPRISE JUST SIX AND A HALF ASCENT OF THE S. THE MILES. BY SEVEN EIGHT TRUCKS AND STAY. ALSO COMMON FLEETS OPERATE FOR LEAST. MAKING ALL TERM MARGIN. IN CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE MORE DIFFICULT. PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CHARGING COULD FILL THIS GAP BUT IT TODAY'S CHARGING SPEEDS IT COULD TAKE ANYWHERE FROM BETWEEN ONE AND A HALF TO FOUR HOURS. THE CHARGER TRUCK IN THOUSANDS OF MULTIPLE MEGAWATT STATIONS WOULD NEED TO BE CONSTRUCTED. IN SUMMARY CLASS SEVEN ELECTRIC TRUCKS CAN WORK IN CERTAIN RETURN TO BASE OPERATIONS BUT THAT WILL BE THE EXCEPTION RATHER THAN THE RULE UNTIL BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES OR OTHER OPTIONS SUCH AS HYDROGEN FUEL CELL VEHICLES EMERGE. A FEW RECOMMENDATIONS FOR THE COMMITTEE FIRST OF CALIFORNIA MUST FOCUS ON BUILDING A ZERO EMISSION FINAL MILE DELIVERY MARKET. EVEN WITH THE ADVANTAGES HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER THIS WILL BE A MAJOR UNDERTAKING FOR INSTANCE THE INFRASTRUCTURE COST. JOBS FOR CLASS TO BE IN THREE TRUCKS ALONE COULD BE FIVE TO TEN BILLION DOLLARS BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE. PERSON STATE CARDS ENTIRE AND BUS RADIAL. WHICH REDUCE THE PARTICULATE MATTER BY OVER 99% BY TURNING OVER A MILLION VEHICLES. POSHEST TWO POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS. SECOND ENSURE ACCESS TO TAXPAYER FUNDED-PROGRAMS FOR ALL FLEETS. IN NOVEMBER OF LAST YEAR CARB RESTRICTED- FLEETS OF FIFTY OR MORE TRUCKS FOR PARTICIPATING IN A TRAP. THE STATE'S LARGEST ELECTRIC TRUCK INCENTIVE PROGRAM. THIS DECISION WILL DELAY THE STATE FROM ACHIEVING ITS ZERO EMISSION GOALS AND SHOULD BE REPRESENTED AS THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDERS THIS YEAR'S BUDGET. THANKS AGAIN TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE TODAY AND I LOOK FORWARD ANSWER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MISTER SHIMODA WE APPRECIATE YOUR PRESENTATION. FINAL PANELIST AND AN PANEL NUMBER TWO IS MISS JESSICA DURHAM PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES ALLIANCE FOR A NEW ECONOMY WELCOME. THANK YOU TERRY GONZALEZ AND TO ALL THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS JESSICA DURHAM AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE COURTS PROJECT THAT LANE. WHERE WE WORK TO PROMOTE CLEAN AIR GOOD JOBS AND HELP THE COMMUNITY. CAMPAIGN WE PARTNER WITH THE TEAMSTERS FOR YEARS TO TRANSFORM THE PORT TRUCKING INDUSTRY THE COURTS OF THE LAND LONG BEACH. FOR DECADES PORT TRUCK DRIVERS AND COMMUNITIES SUFFERED FROM THE NEGATIVE EXTERNALITIES. CREATED BY AN UNACCOUNTABLE INDUSTRY. DELHI POLLUTION AND EXPLOITATIVE WORKING CONDITIONS. IN TWO THOUSAND SIX WE JOIN WITH OUR LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL PARTNERS TACKLE THE ROOT CAUSE OF THE POVERTY INCLUSION OF THE PORTS. INDUSTRY SYSTEMIC CLASSIFICATION OF DRIVER IS AS CLOSE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. WHEN IS CLASSIFIED CHECKING NOT ONLY UNLAWFUL DEPRIVED DRIVERS. RIGHT RIGHT FROM PROTECTIONS ALSO UNLAWFULLY FORCED TRUCK BECAUSE ON THE BACKS OF THE SAME DRIVERS TWO YEARS AGO WE ADVOCATED WITH OUR COALITION PARTNERS FOR CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM AT THE FOR THE LANDMARK BEACH THAT WOULD BE SUSTAINABLE ADDRESSING THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS MODEL AND ENSURING THAT THE INDUSTRY WOULD TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE FOR THE TRANSITION. UNFORTUNATELY THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY CHALLENGE THAT POST IN THE COURTS. ULTIMATELY GETTING IT. LEFT US WITH A MANDATE FOR NEW CONTRACTS WITH NO DRIVER PROTECTIONS COMPANIES PASSED THE BUILDING DRIVERS. AND THE RESULTING WAGE THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN BY THE LEGAL SYSTEM INCLUDING OVER FIVE HUNDRED LABOR COMMISSIONER AND COURT DECISIONS. AND WAS DOCUMENTED BY USA TODAY AS MODERN DAY INDENTURED SERVITUDE THAT IF THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF DRIVERLESS CLASSIFICATION IS NOT ADDRESSED THEN WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO REACH OUR MISSION- NOT ONLY WOULD BE IMMORAL PRINCE TO YET AGAIN FORCED DRIVERS TO BEAR THAT BURDEN. IT'S ALSO UNSUSTAINABLE. REPORTS MOST RECENT DATA SHOW THAT THE EMISSIONS GAINES IN THE FIRST CONTRACT PROGRAMMER RECEIVING A TREND THAT BEGAN WELL BEFORE THE RECENT CONGESTION THIS IS PARTLY BECAUSE DRIVERS CAN AFFORD UPGRADES OR EVEN OFF AND REPAIR DIESEL ENGINES IN THE LNG TRUCK BECAUSE THEY WERE DROWNING IN REPAIR BILLS. ANECDOTES ARE BORN OUT OF CARDS OWN DATA WHICH OTHER TRUCKS IN THE SO CALLED CONTRACTING SEGMENT HAVE THE LOWEST COMPLIANCE WITH THE STATE'S TRUCK COMBUSTIBLE. IS WE'VE HEARD YOU THEIR MISSION TRUCK CAN COST TEN TIMES MORE. SO TO THE POINT THAT INDEPENDENT CON INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATORS WILL NEED FINANCIAL SUPPORT I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THE MOST IF NOT ALL HE SAYS THAT WE SUPPORT USED TRUCK OWNERS ARE IN FACT EMPLOYEES UNDER THE LAW. AS A LEGAL SYSTEM SYSTEM HAS OVERWHELMINGLY FOUND. NOT ONLY UNSUSTAINABLE FOR THEIR EMPLOYERS THE PAST TRUCK COSTS ON TO THEM IT'S ILLEGAL WE MUST ENSURE THAT OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE NOT. USED YET AGAIN TO FORCE DRIVERS AND THE PUBLIC PREDATORY LOANS AN INDENTURED SERVITUDE. WERE DISTURBING PUBLIC FUNDS TO PRIVATE INDUSTRY THAT HAS REAPED RECORD PROFITS BREADED THAT THEY COULD NOT MAKE. WE MUST MAKE SURE THAT AND SEVEN DOLLARS AND THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS ATTACHED BUT IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND LABOR STANDARDS FOR DRIVERS. REGARDING THE IMPORTANCE OF THEIR MISSION I WANT TO ECHO THE POINTS RAISED BY ANGELA BUT HE FEELS REGARDING THE LABOR STANDARDS WE MUST ENSURE FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND VIGOROUS ENFORCEMENT OF AB SEVEN NINE FOUR. AND IF THE THREE THREE EIGHT AND A HUGE THANK YOU TO SENATOR SILENCE FOR HER LEADERSHIP IN RAISING THE STANDARDS. WE ALSO NEED MORE STRATEGIC COMPREHENSIVE ENFORCEMENT BY STATE AGENCIES TO ROOT OUT THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY. ONE LAST POINT ABOUT A PAYMENT THAT WHEN EMPATHIZE ELECTRIFICATION SHOULD NOT MEAN AUTOMATION VERY OFTEN THE INDUSTRY USES THIS ISSUE TO CREATE A FALSE DICHOTOMY AND PET LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL INTERESTS. AGAINST EACH OTHER WE CAN WE SHOULD TRANSITION OUR- AND ELECTRIFICATION. BY MAINTAINING THE GOOD UNION JOBS WE HAVE IN THE GOOD FOR THAT SECTOR AND FUELING THIS OPPORTUNITY TO CREATE A MARKET JOBS SOME CLOTHING AS LONG AS THE INDUSTRY. THAT OUR COURTS. BEYOND UP OUT OPERATE OUTSIDE OF THE LAN WITH AN ILLEGAL BUSINESS MODEL IF THE CLASSIFICATION. IT WILL CONTINUE. TO HINDER OUR EFFORTS TO BE TRANSITION. BUT THE BILL OF DOLLARS IN THE CENTER FUND THAT WILL GOING TO THAT KIND. WE HAVE A REAL UP. TO TRY. COURT INTO HIGH AND THE- AND THE LEFT THE DRIVE. AND FRONT LIKE COMMUNITY. THANK YOUNG. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY I'M WE APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE AND TIME IS WELL. THAT COULD. OUR TO OUR STAKEHOLDER PANEL- AND WILL NOW TAKE IT TO THE FLOOR FOR ANY QUESTIONS FROM SENATORS ON THIS PANEL- WE HAVE SENATOR DOLLY. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. I HAVE A QUESTION WHAT DOES IT COST TO- TO CHARGE- WHEN THESE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. THAT DIRECTED TO ANY SPECIFIC US ANALYST YEAH WELL I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE THAT'S THE THINK- IS TIMELY IS GOING OFF MUTINOUS TIMELY WOULD LIKE TO ANSWER. UNFORTUNATELY I DON'T HAVE THE EXACT NUMBERS BUT THAT'S PART OF WHAT WE'RE GATHERING THROUGH THE DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS THAT WE'VE BEEN CONDUCTING THERE'S A LOT OF UNKNOWNS ABOUT THIS TECHNOLOGY AND WHAT IT MEANS TO CHARGE THEM- AND- QUITE FRANKLY. THE TIME THAT YOU CHARGE THEM HOW MANY YOU HAVE CHARGING AT THE SAME TIME THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT FACTORS THAT GO INTO YOU THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT THE DEMONSTRATIONS WERE DOING ARE TO HELP US GATHER THAT INFORMATION SO WE CAN MAKE BETTER PROJECTIONS. ABOUT WHAT THE COST WILL BE BUT ALSO WHAT TYPE OF INFRASTRUCTURE IS NECESSARY TO BE ABLE TO BUILD OUT SO THAT WE CAN CONDUCT THE OPERATIONS IN A WAY THAT CAN SUPPORT- THAT THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES THAT WE NEED TO BE CHARGED THIRTY WILL SIMULTANEOUSLY. THE FOLLOW QUESTION ANSWER IT. I DON'T KNOW WHO MENTIONED IT BUT ONE OF ONE OF THE PANELISTS MENTIONED THE COST OF THE TRUCK COULD BE TEN TIMES AS MUCH AS A CONVENTIONAL THAT WAS AN ACCURATE. SO I THINK I MENTIONED IN MY COMMENTS AND NETWORK WHEN I'M TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THERE IS NOT NECESSARILY THAT A BRAND NEW ZERO EMISSIONS TRUCK IS TEN TIMES MORE THAN A BRAND NEW DIESEL TRUCK. DATE THAT WE HAVE IS THE MAJORITY OF FOLKS AND I THINK CHRIS COULD PROBABLY ANSWER THIS A LITTLE BIT MORE DIRECTLY THE MORE MAJORITY OF THE FOLKS TO PARTICIPATE AND PORT DRAINAGE ARE PURCHASING BRAND NEW TRUCKS RIGHT OFF THAT IS THOUGH NOT THEIR PURHASING USED TRUCKS THAT ARE MUCH CHEAPER. FOR THEM TO BE ABLE TO GET INTO BED THAT IS SERVICE AND SO TRYING TO ASK THOSE FOLKS TO GET INTO A BRAND NEW ELECTRIC OR FUEL CELL TRUCK IS A BIG LEAP FROM WHAT THEY ARE TYPICALLY USED TO PAYING. OKAY WOULD YOU LIKE TO ASK ANOTHER CLEAR RESTAURANTS COULD ANSWER THAT'D BE GREAT BECAUSE I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. YEAH WE DO WE THE LAST TIME I WAS TALKED ABOUT. YOU KNOW BASICALLY LABOR ISSUES AND SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT INDEPENDENT TRUCKERS- THAT. I'D LIKE TO KIND OF GET AN IDEA OF WHAT I MEAN WE'VE SEEN. WE'VE SEEN THE PORTS CONGESTED IN IN IS THAT DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE- MISSIONS ARE HAVE BEEN THERE OR THAT THEY CAN AFFORD THE TRUCKS OR IS IT BECAUSE WE HAVE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS WHO HAVE. CAN'T COME IN THERE. HERE TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION WITH REGARDS TO THE INDUSTRY I MEAN WANT ONE OF THE REASONS WHY. I WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT. YOU KNOW THESE LARGER FLEETS ARE BEING EXCLUDED FROM THE STATE'S INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IS THAT. IT'S REALLY THOSE LARGE MEDIUM SIZE FLEETS THEY'RE GONNA HAVE THE WHERE WITH ALL. TO MAKE THESE INITIAL INVESTMENTS TO BUILD THIS MARKET WHERE I THINK IN THE CHOIR PANEL. THERE WAS A DISCUSSION ABOUT THERE'S FEWER THAN A HUNDRED. ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD TODAY AND SO- THE TRUCKING INDUSTRY AT LARGE I MEAN. SETTING ASIDE THE INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR ISSUE. NATIONALLY OPERATE TWENTY OR FEWER TRUCKS AND SO DID THIS IS A SMALL BUSINESS. MOM AND POP ORIENTED INDUSTRY TO BEGIN WITH. ARE WE REALLY NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT ARE. YOU KNOW LARGER INDUSTRY LEADERS CAN GET. STATE SUPPORT TO- YOU KNOW REALLY TAKE THAT THE FIRST STEP IN THE WATER WITH THESE ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK- AND THEN. REALLY YOU KNOW EVENTUALLY OVER TIME AS THE TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES THESE MARKETS WILL BUILD ON THEIR OWN- AS BATTERY TECHNOLOGY IMPROVES AND ACTUALLY FIGURE OUT. YOU KNOW HOW T INTEGRATE THIS. INTO THE SUPPLY CHAIN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR DOLLY OR SEE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. OKAY I DO HAVE A QUESTION I THINK THE L. DIRECT THIS TO MISS TOMMY. I THINK THERE WAS A QUESTION PRIOR ABOUT A TWO BILLION DOLLARS POTENTIALLY FOR A HYDROGEN HUB- IN LOCKPORT OF LONG BEACH. PORT ST PETER- BAY CAN YOU TOUCH ON THAT A BIT AND WHAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE ARE ANY UPDATES ON THAT AND- YOU KNOW THAT WILL CERTAINLY FURTHER ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS BUT WOULD LOVE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THAT AND THEN I HAVE ANOTHER QUESTION RELATED TO. THE CONTAINER FEE. SURE I CAN PROVIDE A FEW BRIEF COMMENTS. AND WE'RE VERY WE'RE ALSO TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT WE'RE ALSO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITIES IN THE FUTURE FOR HYDROGEN. WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH UC IRVINE FOR MANY YEARS AS A PART OF OUR DEMONSTRATION PROJECTS. FOCUSED ON YOUR MISSION AND MY GIRLFRIENDS. AND AT UC IRVINE- APPROACHED US ABOUT PREPARING OUR RENEWABLE HYDROGEN ROAD MAP FOR THAT RIGHT TO SAN PEDRO BAY. SO THAT WE COULD DO YOU A LOT OF THE IMPORTANT PLANNING AND FORECASTING WORK TO BETTER UNDERSTAND- HOW HYDROGEN COULD HELP. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR OUR DRIVE TO GET TO ZERO EMISSIONS AND SHOW. THAT ROADMAP. WORK IS UNDER WAY AND REYES OUT AT A PLAN TO HELP US- ABOUT THE INITIAL PLANNING AND THEN UNDERSTAND OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WHAT IT WILL TAKE. TO BE ABLE TO DEVELOP MORE HYDROGEN TO SUPPORT YOUR MISSION OPERATIONS AT THAT IN THE GOODS MOVEMENT SECTOR AND. THAT THE PORT SPECIFICALLY. THANK YOU MISTER PRE THAT AND I UNDER YOU KNOW THIS IS. THERE THE CONTAINER FEE HAS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT HAS BEEN BROUGHT UP MULTIPLE TIMES OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS PLUS PLUS- BUT JUST IN RECENT TIMES RELATED TO PORT CONGESTION. AND SO CAN YOU GIVE US AN UPDATE ON WHERE WE'RE AT I UNDERSTAND THERE'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER CONTAINER FEE HOPEFULLY IMPOSED IN APRIL- THOSE DOLLARS FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND WOULD GO BACK TOWARD THE CLEAN TRUCK PROGRAM SO WOULD LOVE TO LEARN MORE ABOUT. WHERE WE'RE AT AND HOW WE CAN FURTHER EXACERBATE- THE NEED FOR CLEANER AIR HERE IN THE- SOUTH COAST REGION. ABSOLUTELY SHOULD THERE ARE ACTUALLY TWO DIFFERENT- CHARGES. THAT ARE. BEING DISCUSSED RIGHT NOW ONE IS IT'S MORE RELATED TO THE CONGESTION AND THAT'S THAT CONTAINER ACCESS TO WELL HE- THAT WAS ADOPTED AND PROPOSED AS A DETERRENT. TO ENCOURAGE- THAT THE CONTAINERS THAT WORD SPENDING EXCESS TIME INTHE TERMINALS. YOUR COURAGE THOSE TO BE PICKED UP AND MOVED OUT OF THE TERMINALS IF THEY'RE THERE FOR LONGER THAN TWO. DAYS- NINE DAYS THEY'D BE SUBJECT YOU WOULD BE AND AS A RESULT OF THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF FIFTY IT'S HAD ITS INTENDED EFFECT AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO SEE. A REALLY SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN LONG TWELVE TRAINERS THAT HE HAS BANNED THAT POSTPONED NUMEROUS TIMES. MOST RECENTLY THE ANNOUNCEMENT CAME OUT IT WILL BE POSTPONED UNTIL AT LEAST FEBRUARY NINETEENTH I BELIEVE IS THE DATE. BUT IT'S BEING RECONSIDERED AND AS LONG AS IT'S CONTINUING TO HAVE THE INTENDED EFFECT OF- OF. GETTING BETTER THE LONG DWELL CONTAINERS MOVED OUT OF THE TERMINALS. WILL CONTINUE TED TO POSTPONE IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT WORKING AS IT AS INTENDED. THE OTHER RATE THAT- YOU MENTIONED IT IS FEARED- THAT CLEAN TRUCK FIND RATE. THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED BY BOTH- PORT OF LONG BEACH IN FRONT OF LOS ANGELES. YOUR INITIATE ON APRIL FIRST AND THAT'S A RATE THAT WE WOULD CHARGE AGAINST TRUCKS THAT CALL AT THE TERMINALS. IF THEY DON'T MEET CERTAIN STANDARDS SO THEY WOULD HAVE EXEMPTIONS IF THE TRUCKS ARE ZERO EMISSIONS. OR EXEMPTIONS IF THEY'RE LOW KNOCKS UNDER AT A CERTAIN SPECIFIED SET OF IT EXEMPTION CRITERIA THAT. MIGHT BE DIFFERENT ON THE LOW KNOCKS TRUCKS ETWEEN THE TWO PORTS. THE RATE THAT WE WOULD BE CHARGING IS TEN DOLLARS PER LOADED TDO AND ON AVERAGE. WITH THE MANAGER RT OF TRUCKS BEING AT- TO TEACH YOU WOULD BE CHARGING ON OUT ABOUT. DOLLARS A BOX. THAT THAT WE GENERATE WITH THE RAPPER FROM THROUGH THE RATE WILL BE YEARS TO HELP AND- THE TRAIN. AND THAT. CLEANER AND WHAT DOES YOUR IMAGE TRUCKS THEY WERE TALKING ABOUT TWO. SO THAT WILL HELP US TO GENERATE FINDING PAY FOR THAT TRANSITION INTO HELP EXTRA. THE INTRODUCTION UP THOSE THOSE CLEANER TRUCKS INTO THIS WEEK BUT IT ALSO. IS ONLY A PART OF WHAT WE NEED WE TALKED ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT NEED FOR INFRASTRUCTURE WE TALKED ABOUT THE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE WITH THE COST FOR THESE TRUCKS SAID TOGETHER WITH THAT FINDING THAT THE ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE STATE. FINDS ME HERE- THIS THIS ONE THAT WE'RE GENERATING WHAT HELPED TO SUPPLEMENT. THOSE OTHER EFFORTS AS WELL. THANK YOU AND DO WE HAVE ANY REVENUE PROJECT. FOR CLEAN TRUCK FUND RATE. SO BASED THAT CARGO VOLUMES THAT WE'VE SEEN AND THE AMOUNT OF DRUG ACTIVITY AND THE TRUCKS THAT WOULD BE SUBJECT TO PAYING THE RATE WE'RE ANTICIPATING THAT THE FUND WILL GENERATE BETWEEN EIGHTY AND NINETY MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH I GUESS MY- FOLLOW UP TO THAT IS THAT WE CONTINUE TO. PUSH NOT ONLY- OURSELVES HERE IN THE STATE LEGISLATURE BUT REALLY PRIVATE INDUSTRY AS WELL TO BE A PART OF THIS PROBLEM AND SALUTE OUR PREP PART OF THE SOLUTION EXCUSE ME. TO BE ABLE TO PIVOT TO ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE COMMUNITIES THAT NEED IT THE MOST- FINAL FINAL QUESTION IS FOR ANY OF THE STAKEHOLDERS AND WE TALKED ABOUT- OF COURSE LABOR ISSUES. AND ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE BUT IF THERE'S ANYTHING ELSE WHAT MORE CAN THE LEGISLATURE DO AT THIS POINT I KNOW THAT THERE'S- IT'S STILL A LITTLE MURKY IN TERMS OF WHAT THE COST TO COST DIFFERENTIALS ARE FOR CHARGING HEAVY DUTIES AND FOR THE ACTUAL TRUCKS THEMSELVES. AND WHAT THAT MEANS FOR THE TRUCK DRIVERS THAT ARE IN AND AROUND THE PORTS- BUT ANYTHING- SORT OF LAST COMMENTS FROM STAKEHOLDERS- THAT. WOULD BE HELPFUL. I DID. NOBODY ELSE IS GONNA JUMP AND I WILL AGAIN. YEAH YOU KNOW I THINK I THINK WHAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT IS THAT WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE MAGNITUDE OF THE CHANGE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. IMPLEMENTING THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES AHEAD OF US TO BE ABLE TO GET THERE AND TO DO IT SUCCESSFULLY. WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON THAT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES IN THE CONDUCT THESE DEMONSTRATIONS THE LARGER SCALE DEMONSTRATIONS THAT. WILL BE COMING ONLINE HERE IN THE NEAR TERM WILL BE REALLY CRITICAL TO HELP US ADVANCE THESE TECHNOLOGIES. WE SHOULD NOT UNDERESTIMATE THE CHALLENGES WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT'S GOING TO BE NECESSARY. TO BUILD OUT TO SUPPORT ME. JEEZ PLANNING IS A CRITICAL PART OF THAT WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE UNDERSTAND WHAT OUR NEEDS ARE. HOW DID THE INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS TO BE. PROVIDED IN A WAY TO SUPPORT THOSE OPERATIONS SO THAT THAT IT WILL WORK FOR OUR OPERATIONAL NEEDS. AND WE ALSO NEED TO MOVE FORWARD IN A WAY THAT YOU'RE- STARTING WITH CARROTS AND ALSO EATING FOR THE STICKS WE NEED TO HAVE CLEAR TARGETS OF WHERE WE'RE GOING. SO THAT WE CAN FOCUS OUR ATTENTION AND REALLY WORK OUR WAY THROUGH THESE REALLY DIFFICULT CHALLENGES. AND THAT AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING. TOGETHER TO DO THAT WHERE SUBSIDIES SO THAT WE DON'T LEAVE ANYBODY BEHIND. AND IN THIS TRANSITION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MY- AT YES PLEASE GARDNERIAN THE TITLE AGAIN. I THINK IN THE- SPIRIT- AS- HOW MANY I MENTION WE SHOULD UNDER. ARE A BILL TO BE AND THEN. AND BE ABLE TO BE SOLVERS AT THE PROPRIETY YOU KNOW OVER TO YEARS AGO CAN A ROBOT MARS WE HAVE BEEN A ROBOT MARTIN GET BIGGER OUT ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY ALL OF THAT. IT'S MORE ABOUT THE WILL- POLICYMAKERS AND PEOPLE ON THE GROUND BE ABLE TO WORK TOGETHER AND BEING REALLY INNOVATIVE I MEAN IS OF THE ACT AND- WE DO NOT RECALL THAT YOU HAVE GENERATIONS OF PEOPLE THAT WILL HAVE- YOUR PREMATURE DEATH AND ARE REALLY MINIMAL HOW. AND THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS REAL WE SEE IT EVERYDAY ON THE GROUND AND IT'S REALLY ABOUT TAKING ACTION AND CELEBRATING. HELLO THANK YOU. I COULD ALL JUST BILL UP FROM I'M ANGELES SAYING- YOU KNOW IT WE HAVE ALL THOSE. FOR THIS IS A- YOU KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO TRANSITION TO ZERO EMISSION WE KNOW WHAT IT TAKES. WE HAVE THE TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS WHAT WE NEED IS THAT WILL AND DESIRE TO GET IT DONE AND IN SOME CASES FUNDING INITIALLY. TO HELP GET US OVER THE HUMP IN THE NEAR TERM. BUT I WOULD ALSO URGE YOU ALL TO THINK ABOUT HOW TO STRUCTURE INCENTIVES TO LEVERAGE PRIVATE DOLLARS PARTICULARLY ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE SIDE. I THINK TOO OFTEN WE'RE FOCUSING ON YOU KNOW WHAT THE REGULATORS WITH THE UTILITIES TO NEW- BUT IN REALITY YOU KNOW THIS TRANSITION ALSO. PAID THE MANUFACTURERS OF THESE VEHICLES AND WE'RE SEEING THEM AGAIN TO STEP UP AND DO THAT. FOR EXAMPLE DAIMLER BLACKROCK AND NEXTERA ENERGY JUST MADE AN ANNOUNCEMENT. THE OTHER WEEK ABOUT A HALF A BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN. LONG HAUL CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY SO IT'S THOSE KIND OF THINGS THAT YOU NEED TO BE- DOING. THANK WOULD NOTE. THAT THERE ARE TO STRUCTURE INSIDE TO. YEAH J. SAID POLICIES AS WELL PARTICULARLY ON LIKE THE LABOR SIDE OF THINGS SO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE ATTACHING A GOOD LABOR PRACTICES AND STANDARDS TO ANY INCENTIVE DOLLARS THEY WERE GONNA BE GIVEN TO FLEETS OR MANUFACTURERS IS REALLY IMPORTANT- AS WELL AS YOU KNOW IDENTIFYING TARGETED COMMUNITIES STATE. THESE VEHICLES AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. INCENTIVE DOLLARS TOWARDS THOSE WHO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I THINK- MYSTERON WILL HAVE A FINAL BUT WE DO HAVE A LAST QUESTION BY SENATOR RUBIO. YOU THINK YOU KNOW JUST TO EXPAND A BIT ON ONE OF THE LAST POINT THAT THE- RAINS- IN TERMS OF FUNDING YOU KNOW I MENTIONED THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE. FULL IMPLEMENTATION AND PROGRESS REPORTS ONE OF EIGHTY SEVEN NINETY FOUR- WE WANT TO MAKE SURE CARP HAD THE RESOURCES THEY NEED. TO MAKE SURE THAT COMPANIES THAT ARE RECEIVING FUNDS THROUGH KERR- ARE IN FOR FULL COMPLIANCE WITH OUR STATE EMPLOYMENT AND TAX LAWS AND THAT THEY STAND COMPLEMENT. CLIENT YOUR THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF THAT SUBSIDY- AND ALSO AGAIN YOUR FOR CHRISTMAS SB THREE THREE EIGHT WHICH- YOU KNOW YOU WORK SO HARD TO MAKE SURE. WE GOT THAT- ACROSS THE FINISH LINE TO EXPAND CRITERION TO CREATE- RETAILER JOINT LIABILITY YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVEN'T TALKED ABOUT. I HAVEN'T HEARD BE DOES MENTION THAT STEVE AT THE END OF THE DAY THE CARGO OWNERS REALLY ARE THE ONES. THAT ARE PROFITING OFF OF THE SYSTEM AND THAT HAVE THE POWER TO- NOT JUST ENSURE THAT THERE. ARE HIGHLY RISKY INTEREST IN THEIR AND THEIR SUPPLY CHAINS BUT ALSO BEHIND HIM ARMED STATE. I'M IN A FAMILY OF IT AGREED WITH MR SHIMON AND THAT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT TRUCKING COMPANIES THAT ARE GETTING OUR PRECIOUS PUBLIC DOLLARS ARE- CAPITAL IT'S ENOUGH AND SOLID ENOUGH TO- MAINTAIN THE VEHICLES TO MAKE SURE THE TRUCKS ARE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE ALSO RESPECTING THEIR DRIVERS LABOR RIGHTS AS WELL. AND SO THAT YOU KNOW AS AGAIN- DISTRICT. CENTRE FUNDS THAT WERE MAKING SURE. THAT WE HAVE THE HIGHEST POSSIBLE STANDARDS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR AND SO. RUBIO HAS A QUESTION. VEXED WITH A LITTLE BIT A COMMON THINK I WANT TO THINK PART A LOT OF LONG BEACH FOR A JUST COMMITMENT UP TO A ALL CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. AND I KNOW THAT LONG BEACH I KNOW THE AREA WELL IT IT'S VERY CLOSE TO MY DISTRICT AND I KNOW THAT THAT'S WHERE NATURALLY PEOPLE GO IN TERMS OF BY. CARGO IN TRUCKS AND WE DON'T NECESSARILY THINK ABOUT IT IN THESE INNER CITIES RIDE SO I WAS THINKING IN TERMS OF REGIONAL SUPPORT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE CAN DO TO HELP CREATE THIS WITH THESE- REGIONAL NETWORKS WHERE EVERYONE HAS. CHARGING STATIONS REFUELING STATIONS NOT ONE COMMUNITY GETS STUCK I HAVE IN THESE TRUCKS COME THROUGH THERE AND THERE ARE AREAS HOW CAN WE SUPPORT THAT REGIONAL. A PLAN REGIONAL APPROACH- JUST TO MAKE IT EQUITABLE ACROSS THOSE REGIONS THAT DON'T NECESSARILY CANNOT OR NOT THEY'RE NOT LONG BEACH BUT YET WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT THE TRUCKS COMING THROUGH OUR COMMUNITY. ARE YOU REFERRING TO LIKE IN IN LEARN INLAND PORT MODEL WELL YOU KNOW I'M THINKING MORE ABOUT THE YOU KNOW WHEN WE THINK OF LIKE CHARGING STATIONS REFUELING STATIONS RIGHT WE THINK OF LONG BEACH IN TERMS OF THAT'S WHERE THE CARGO IS ENOUGH FOR THE FREIGHTS ARE BUT- BUT THE TO COME TO OUR COMMUNITIES AS WELL AND I'M JUST THINKING. REGIONALLY EARLIER I HEARD YOU SAY THAT WE HAVE TO HAVE LIKE YOUR TARGETS FOR THE FUTURE YOU TALK ABOUT THE UNCERTAINTY A LOT OF A KNOWN SO WE WHEN I HEAR THESE THINGS I ALWAYS. THINK DO WE NEED TO REALLY. AND ALLOW FOR THE OF A- UP WHERE THESE CHARGE STATIONS ARE GONNA WHAT WE TALK ABOUT FIND. AND PUT FIGHTING AND IN THE AREAS. MAKING SURE THESE AGAIN THESE LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE ALSO ACCESS TO PLANNING AND BEING ENGAGED IN THE PROCESS I GUESS I. WANT TO SEE HOW WE CAN SUPPORT. A MUCH BROADER PLANNING EFFORTS- CERTAINLY AND I THINK THAT MISS TIMELY IF YOU'D LIKE TO ADDRESS THAT JUST ON. HOW WELL SEEN OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE OUR ADJACENT PORT COMMUNITIES BUT THERE ARE OBVIOUSLY INLAND THE INLAND EMPIRE THAT SEES THESE- AFFECTS OF- YOU KNOW EMISSIONS AS WELL SO IF YOU'D IKE TO ADDRESS THAT ON. ON WHAT ELSE. IS BEING DONE MORE ON IN IN SORT OF A REGIONAL APPROACH. TO SENATOR RUBIO'S QUESTION. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT FOR THE QUESTION AND FOR THE- RECOGNITION OF. THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND IMPORT OF LONG BEACH. WHEN IT COMES TO INFRASTRUCTURE WE ALSO JUST RECENTLY COMPLETED A CHARGING AND FUELING STUDY SO THAT WE CAN BETTER UNDERSTAND. THE CHALLENGES WITH BUILDING OUT THAT THE CHARGING AND FUELING INFRASTRUCTURE BUT ALSO WHERE THERE MIGHT BE OPPORTUNITIES TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THAT WITHIN THE BOUNDARIES OF THE PORT. WE ALSO JUST RELEASED A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION. FROM THE- CHARGING I AM. YEARLING SUPPLIERS. TO GIVE US PROPOSALS LOOKING AT YOUR PARTICULAR SPOT IN THAT PORT OF LONG BEACH WHERE THEY MIGHT BE ABLE TO BUILD OUT- CHARGING STATIONS. TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT YOUR MISSION TRACKS BUT TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE OPERATIONAL NEEDS IT'S NOT JUST CHARGING AND FUELING IN THE COURT ITSELF WE NEED A REGIONAL NETWORK LIKE YOU POINTED OUT. YEAH WELL TO SUPPORT THESE OPERATIONS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE AREA THIS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATIONS OF GOVERNMENT IS WORKING ON AN INFRASTRUCTURE STUDY THAT THEY'RE JUST KICKING OFF NOW AND IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT THEY'RE GOING TO BE WORKING ON OVER THE NEXT COUPLE YEARS I HEARD COMMISSIONER MORNING HAND TALK ABOUT HOW- CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION IS ALSO WORKING ON A STATE WIDE STUDY. I THINK THAT THAT THOSE STUDIES ARE GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR US TO UNDERSTAND WHAT THE NEEDS ARE. BUT WE ALSO UNDERSTAND FROM THE LIMITED WORK THAT WE'VE DONE AND HELPING TO PUT AN INFRASTRUCTURE WE BUILT TO PUBLIC CHARGING STATIONS IN THE PORT OF LONG BEACH. AND WE'VE ALSO BEEN TALKING WITH SEVERAL OTHERS ABOUT BUILDING OUT ADDITIONAL ONES THERE ARE A LOT OF CHALLENGES WITH PUTTING IN THESE CHARGERS A LOT OF CHALLENGES WORKING IN MULTIPLE JURISDICTIONS WITH NAVIGATING THROUGH THE PERMITTING PROCESS TO PUT IN HYDROGEN FUELING STATIONS AND PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE CHARGERS. AND SO FROM THE STATE PERSPECTIVES. HELPING YOU ASSEMBLY TATE HE IS AN AND MOVING THROUGH THAT PROCESS SO THAT WE CAN MORE EASILY CONSTRUCT AND INSTALL THESE TYPES. OF INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THIS THESE REGIONAL TRUCKS IN AREAS WHERE THEY DON'T IMPACT THAT LOCAL COMMUNITIES WITH ADDITIONAL TRUCK TRAFFIC. IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR US TO DO THE PLANNING THAT CAN READ NEED TO BE AND THEN TO HELP FACILITATE THE CONSTRUCTION SO THAT THEY INFRASTRUCTURE CAN COME ONLINE AS. QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE YOUR SUPPORT YET THIS YEAR AND OFFER. ON THE TIME LINES THAT WE'VE WAITED. THANK YOU MISS THING YOU SENATOR RUBIO AND- I AM LAST YEAR WE ACTUALLY PASSED THROUGH THIS BODY SB SIX SEVENTY ONE A BILL THAT I AUTHORED CLEAN PRINT CORRIDORS IT LOOKS AT FIVE. WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF THE CALIFORNIA TRANSPORTATION COMMISSION IT LOOKS AT FIVE MOST CONGESTED HIGHWAYS- BUT THE NOT JUST THE FREIGHT CORRIDORS BUT ALSO SEGMENTS OF THE QUARTERS THAT WOULD SPEAK TO YOUR QUESTION ON LIKE IN A MORE OF A REGIONAL% APPROACH TO LOOKING AT HOW WE CAN. DEPLOY ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGIES AND- AND VEHICLES SO THANK YOU FOR THAT QUESTION SENATOR RUBIO I SEE NO OTHER QUESTIONS ON PANEL NUMBER TWO PANELISTS THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN FOR YOUR TIME. AND YOUR PRESENTATIONS WE MOST APPRECIATE THAT. NOW WE'RE GOING TO FINALIZE OUR PRESENTATIONS HERE WITH PANEL NUMBER THREE BY INDUSTRY. OF THE FIRST PANELIST WE HAVE AS MS NICOLE RICE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLE COALITION. WELCOME MISS RICE. WELCOME THANK YOU MUCH. THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME MADAM CHAIR YES WE CAN. OKAY PERFECT- GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF ONCE AGAIN NICOLE RICE AND I'M THE PRESIDENT OF THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL GAS VEHICLE COALITION. C. NG C. REALLY APPRECIATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR THE DISCUSSION TODAY WE FEEL THAT IT IS EXTREMELY TIMELY AT THIS PARTICULAR JUNCTURE IN THE CLEAN TRANSPORTATION TRANSITION JUST FOR THE REASONS THAT WE TALK ABOUT TODAY. THAT'S A LONGER TERM STRATEGY SEEMS SET BUT WHAT WE DO IN THE NEAR TERM. AND THERE'S BEFORE I GO INTO MY PREPARED AB WHOSE INFORMATION NETWORK COUPLE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO ADDRESS. FIRST AND FOREMOST I WANT TO BE CLEAR THAT. THIS IS NOT A CHOICE BETWEEN ZERO AND NEAR ZERO. THIS IS ABOUT DIESEL VERSUS CLEANER ALTERNATIVES AND WHEN THE TIME OF THOSE TURNS WITH EASE OF ALL RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS HEALTH TRUST ISN'T ELECTRIC. IT'S DIESEL AND SO IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO BE FINDING ABOUT HER DEATH LIKE RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS POWER PLANT DAY THEN BASICALLY THE STATE IS WALKING IN THE CHOICE OF MEANS ALL WORK LEAD OVER. OWNERS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. INFRASTRUCTURE THIS TECHNOLOGY FOR A NATURAL GAS VEHICLES AND TRUCKS IS ALREADY AFTER IT'S SENT IT'S BEEN FUNDED BY THE PRIVATE INVESTMENT BY THE COMMUNITY. AND THEY CAN ALSO SUPPORT THE TRANSITION TO HYDROGEN. SO IF ANY OF THE TIME LINES OR CAPABILITIES CAPACITIES OR ABILITIES THAT WE HAVE FORECASTED FOR THE FUTURE ARE WRONG OR OFF. AND THEN WE WILL JUST LOSE MORE TIME AND SO THAT'S WHY WE THINK THAT IT'S CRITICAL FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO CONSIDER WHAT THEY WILL DO IN THE NEAR TERM AS WELL AS A LONG TERM STRATEGY. SO FOR THE CONCLUSION OF MY COMMENTS ALL WRAPPED THEM AROUND A COUPLE OF THINGS. FIRST OF ALL WHAT ARE THE BENEFITS OF NATURAL GAS STRUTS ALSO KNOWN AS LOW NOT STRUCK NEAR ZERO TRACK. AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT DISCUSSION TODAY SO I'LL JUST WRAP IT UP BY SIMPLY SAYING. UNTIL HEAVY DUTY ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS ARE TRULY COMMERCIAL VIABLE THAT MEANS THAT THEY CAN OPERATE AS A ONE TO ONE REPLACE. THE EXISTING AND DIVERSE DIESEL FLEET THEN RENEWABLY YOUR WERE NOT TRUST ARE THE BEST EFFECTIVE AND IMMEDIATE SOLUTION TO MEETING CALIFORNIA'S AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. IN THE HEAVY DUTY SECTOR. AND WE WERE GLAD TO HEAR. THAT YOU'RE RANDOLPH BELIEVES THAT THERE IS A ROLE FOR ALL TECHNOLOGY TO CONTINUE IN THIS TRANSITION AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH KERR. TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. HOW CAN THIS TECHNOLOGY HELP THE LEGISLATURE MEET AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS WELL HERE'S AN EXCITING POINT THAT WE JUST RECENTLY LEARNED FROM DATA THAT WAS RELEASED BY CAR. RELATED TO THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD THAT CERTIFIES THAT NATURAL GAS USED IN THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IS CARBON NEGATIVE NOW. SO WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT CALIFORNIA ON NATURAL GAS VEHICLES ARE ONLY CARBON NEGATIVE TRANSPORTATION FUEL OPTIONS THAT. CALIFORNIA WANTS TO GO CARBON NEUTRAL NOW BEEN ORANGEY IS THE FEW OPTIONS. AND WHY IS THAT IMPORTANT WELL FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY THREE REQUIRES THE STATE TO REDUCE EMISSIONS FROM SHORT REQUIREMENTS WRITTEN AND SIGNED TO SEVEN BURKE TODAY HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE BEST SOLUTION. IS ONE OF THE CONSUMER WARMING UP THE PLANET IS A RAPID REDUCTION OF SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANTS LIKE METHANE AND BLACK CARBON. WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIRTY FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE LIVING WITH UNHEALTHY AIR MANY AND DISADVANTAGED AND MINORITY COMMUNITIES SO GETTING IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM RELIEF THOSE INDIVIDUALS IS IMPORTANT. SIMPLY ALLOWING DIESEL TO BE THE DEFAULT IN THE ABSENCE OF COMMERCIAL READY EVIDENCE MISSIONS FACT WHEN CLEANER TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE NOW IS INCONSISTENT WITH CALIFORNIA'S CLIMATE CHANGE POLICIES AND ITS DESIRE FOR A HEALTHY STATE AND HEALTHY CALHOUN. SO I'LL CLOSE BY SAYING AGAIN THAT THE CURRENT CHOICE THAT WE OPERATORS ARE MAKING TODAY IS NOT BETWEEN YOU HEARING MISSION AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LOW KNOCKS AND GETS. ITS BETWEEN DIESEL AND A CLEANER AVAILABLE AND RELIABLE ALTERNATE. IT I CAN'T STRESS ENOUGH THAT REPORTING MORE LOW KNOCKS TRACK IT'S NOT GOING TO SLOW DOWN THE ADOPTION OF A ZERO A ZERO EMISSION STRATEGY THAT IS THE STATE'S LONG TERM STRATEGY WHAT WE NEED NOW IS A NEAR TERM STRATEGY. AND ABSENT AN ALTERNATIVE WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BUY DIESEL AND THE PROBLEMS THAT THE POLICIES WERE TO ADDRESS. AND SAW WHAT WE GET WORKS. ONCE THE STATE WAITING FOR THE NEXT BEST TECHNOLOGY MS RICE IF WHATEVER HAPPENS- I'M SORRY WE'VE GONE PAST THE THREE MINUTES THANK YOU SO MUCH ABSOLUTELY. ABSOLUTELY JUST A FEW JUST A LASSEN. EVERY YEAR THAT THE SWEETS TURN OVERTRACKS THE STATE SHOULD BE PROMOTING THE CURRENT BEST TECHNOLOGY. AND TODAY THAT TECHNOLOGY IS LOWER KNOCKS TRACKS. THANK YOU FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND APPRECIATE THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS DISCUSSION THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH MISS RICE WE APPRECIATE THE PRESENTATION. OUR NEXT WE HAVE OUR SECOND PANELIST IS THERESA COOK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR WITH THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION WELCOME MISS COOK. SENATOR GOOD AFTERNOON AT THE PLEASURE TO BE WITH ALL OF YOU TODAY THREE FOR COOKING I CAN'T DIRECTOR AT THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION AND- I GET MY SCREEN READY HERE FOR MY FREE POWER POINT NOT COMING THROUGH. IT LOOKS LIKE YEAH WONDERFUL ALL RIGHT SO JUMPING AND WILL KICK THINGS OFF WITH FUEL CELL VERY ATTRACTIVE. THIS SEGMENT OF HEAVY DUTY IS IN THE PRE COMMERCIALIZATION PHASE I'VE MENTIONED EARLIER THE STRUCTURE CAPABLE OF CARRYING A FULLY LOADED EIGHTY TWO THOUSAND POUNDS OF GOOD. MILEAGE VARIES ANYWHERE BETWEEN THREE HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED MILES AND THE TORQUE OF ELECTRIC VEHICLE PLATFORM ALLOWS FOR BETTER MERGING AND PASSING ON HIGHWAYS REAL VALUE ADD WHEN WE CONSIDER HOW TERRIBLY EVERYBODY'S DRIVING THESE DAYS. THE REAL VALUE PROPOSITION FOR FEELS ALL TRACTORS IN THE HIGH RATE OF UTILIZATION REFUELING TAKES ANYWHERE BETWEEN FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MINUTES ALLOWING THESE TRUCKS TO BE UTILIZED 95% OF THE TIME. VEHICLE COSTS ARE NOT WIDELY AVAILABLE AT THAT POINT MARKET DEVELOPMENT AS NOTED WERE IN A PRE COMMERCIAL FAITH THAT% ALL OF WILLIAM'S ARE STRIVING FOR COST. CHARITY THE TEETH ALL OPERATIONAL COSTS THEY CAN BE UP OWNERSHIP AND TO THAT END WE WOULD RECOMMEND YOU AREA TO FOCUS ON. FIRST DECREASING THE COST OF HYDROGEN FUEL CURRENTLY ANYWHERE BETWEEN TWELVE TO SIXTEEN DOLLARS PER KILOGRAM VERY EXCITED ABOUT- PRESIDENT BY IN HYDROGEN BURKE SHOT TRYING TO GET HYDROGEN Q. A DOLLAR PER KILOGRAM BY TWENTY THIRTY. BUT ALSO WE WANT TO DO MORE TO ENCOURAGE IN STATE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION TO BUILD OUT OUR- SUPPLY OF FUEL BURNING DOWN COSTS ARE ALSO A SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. AND HERE IS WHERE WE CONSIDER THE DYNAMICS BETWEEN HEAVY DUTY AND LIGHT DUTY THE CLASS EIGHT TRUCKS THAT IS OPERATING OUT OF THE PORT OF LA IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER IT'S ACTUALLY TWO PASSENGER VEHICLE MIRAI FUEL CELL STACKS PUT TOGETHER. AND SO WHEN WE COMPARE TWENTY EIGHT MILLION PASSENGER VEHICLE PERSON ABOUT A MILLION AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES IN THE STATE WHAT WE FIND IS THAT BY SCALING UP THE PRODUCTION OF LIGHT DUTY THE COLD WE CAN DRIVE DOWN THE VEHICLE COSTS AT THE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. CONVERSELY THESE TRUCKS HAVE A BIG DEMAND ON HIGH. FUEL THAT I WE UP TO MEET THE PRICE DROP FOR EVERY DRIVING ON THE- VEHICLE. AND EVERYBODY AGREE THAT IN. IN THE FIELD ELECTRIC COMMUNITY MUST PRECEDE VEHICLES TWENTY TWO THAT EXIST FOR HYDROGEN WE'LL TALK ABOUT FUNDING LATER BUT THE PCS ALLOCATING MORE THAN 70% OF ITS DOLLARS TO BATTERY TRACKS. BECAUSE THERE ARE MORE PURCHASE ORDERS. GETTING LARGE VOLUMES OF FUEL CELL OUR PURCHASE ORDER ORDERS REQUIRES AN ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A FUELING NETWORK WILL BE AVAILABLE WHICH WE CAN'T DO UNTIL WE HAVE MORE PURCHASE ORDERS TO SELL IT FACT TRAP THAT HYDROGEN ALL. GET STUCK IN AND TO BE QUITE FRANK IT'S VERY- ON ARE REMINISCENT OF WHAT THE LIGHT DUTY MARKET IS GOING THROUGH. SO WE'LL CHAT MORE A LITTLE BIT. A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT OFFICIALLY. SEVENTY THREE- O. G. YOU'RE HIDING MOBILE AND HAVE DONE SO MUCH TO PROVE THE VALUE PROP. IF YOU'LL FOLLOW ELECTRIC. REPUBLICAN THEN AN OPERATION SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN BEFORE COURSE THEY'D HAVE AN OPERATING CONDITION PUTTING THE SAME AMOUNT OF MILEAGE IN ONE YEAR AT A FUEL CELL VEHICLE DOES IN A LIFETIME BECAUSE THEY'RE OPERATING 99% OF THE TIME. FORKLIFT DRIVER GET PAID BY THE NEW SO FOR A TECHNOLOGY THAT'S AVAILABLE AND UTILIZED 99% OF THE TIME DEMAND IS HIGH THE SAME COULD BE SAID FOR MATERIAL HANDLING AND PORT. LOOKING TO TRANSIT ANOTHER FUEL CELL WORKFORCE CALIFORNIA HAS CLOCKED MORE THAN SIX MILLION PEOPLE ABOUT SMILE TO DATE. THE NUMBERS HERE DO NOT INCLUDE BUT- BUT THERE'S THAT TRANSIT DISTRICT- ARE GOING TO BE ORDERING AS PART OF THEIR INNOVATIVE CLEAN TRANSIT. COMPLIANCE NUMBER TWO INCREASE AND I COMING YEARS. WE'LL TELL YOU TODAY BOX ARE. AND DOLLAR EACH. AT NEW PEOPLE ONE OF THE- WE- ACTIVITY. IT'S GETTING A OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN ORDER OF A HUNDRED ADDED SOMETHING SO AGAIN WE RUN INTO THE ISSUE OF TRYING TO SCALE UP PRODUCTION TO DRIVE DOWN COSTS. THE LINE TRANSIT OUT OF COACHELLA VALLEY IN ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSIT OUR NATIONAL LEADERS IN THE STATE. OF MIND AND HAD A ZERO EMISSION POLICY IN PLACE THANK YOU NINETY FOUR. OPERATE TWENTY ONE PUPIL BUT TODAY I'M WAITING TO TAKE DELIVERY ON FIVE MORE THEY ARE SHOWCASING THE PERFORMANCE OF FUEL CELLS IN EXTREME HEAT JUST LIKE OHIO'S. STARK AREA REGIONAL TRANSIT AUTHORITY IS DOING WITH EXTREME COLD. ALAMEDA COUNTY TRANSIT AUTHORITY HOW THIRTY NINE FEEL FOCUSED ON THE ROAD AND ARE IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING TO FIVE FIVE FIVE STUDIES THAT THIS IS A COPY AND PASTE YOU SEE IN THE BOTTOM RIGHT HAND CORNER. WHICH IS AN ANALYSIS COMPARING ALL THE AVAILABLE DRIVE TRAINS IN TURN IN TERMS OF COST PERFORMANCE AND RANGE. FOR THIS COMMUNITY HYDROGEN FUEL COSTS- PRIORITY SO AS WE DISCUSSED WITH DRAYAGE TRUCKS THE HYDROGEN OR CHAU IN INCREASING STATE PRODUCTION CRITICAL OBJECTIVES FOR THIS COMMUNITY THANK YOU MISS COOK IF WE CAN JUST WRAP UP HERE THAT WOULD BE GREAT WE'RE PASSED THE THREE WORDS WE APPRECIATED. NOT A PROBLEM I AM I THINK THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH DISCUSSION ABOUT NOTHING THAT FEDERAL WE CAN GO AHEAD AND GET IT SO I WOULD JUST ADD INCLUDING THAT ADDING TOGETHER ALL STATE SPENDING ON YOUR MACHINE VEHICLES. LESS THAN GOING TOWARD HYDROGEN DESPITE THE VALUE THAT IT BRINGS TO HEAVY DUTY AND AT THE AARP RECOMMENDS 20% OF PASSENGER VEHICLE. I'M SO THE COMMITTEE ASKED WHAT WOULD OUR SUGGESTION B. Q. ELIMINATE BURIAL TO COMMERCIALIZATION AND SO MY ANSWER TO THAT WOULD BE WE NEED TO STOP LIMITING HYDROGEN INTO A SMALL AFTERTHOUGHT. ONLY BE USED WHEN WE'VE EXHAUSTED ALL OUR TIME AND RESOURCES FORCING BATTERY. CREATING. POLICIES THAT ALLOW HYDROGEN JUST SCALE CREATE ALL. AND BE WITH NOW THREE OUT IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. THREE TECHNOLOGIES BECOME TO COME. AND STAND ON THE OWN I DON'T BE WHY THEY- TO ALL HELLO. RIGHT THANK YOU BETTER YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE PRO. WE THAT AND WE YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT- THE PRESENTATION DECK TO THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE THAT WOULD BE REALLY HELPFUL THIS IS- GREAT TO HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHTS- OUR NEXT AND FINAL PANELIST IS MS I LEAN WINGER TAPPED EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION. THANK YOU MISTYPED A WELCOME YOU MAY START. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN SALAS AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I WANT TO START BY SAYING THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE HERE TODAY AND MORE ARE COMING AND I AM GOING TO SHARE MY SCREEN HERE I'M HOPING YOU CAN ALL SEE IT. LOOKS. CAN YOU SEE THE ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY INFANTRY YES WE CAN'T. SO THEY'RE HUGE ELECTRIC TRUCKS ARE HERE TODAY ON MOST PLATFORMS AND FROM A VERY DIVERSE RANGE OF MANUFACTURERS I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THIS TOOL THAT CAL START CREATED ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY INFANTRY ZEDI WHERE YOU CAN SELECT A REGION AND YOU CAN SEE THAT THESE TRUCKS. ARE AVAILABLE ALL OVER THE WORLD THIS IS NOT JUST CALIFORNIA THAT SHIFTING SHIFTING TO ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS THE WHOLE WORLD IS GOING THIS DIRECTION SO WE ARE WE ARE FAST FOLLOWERS BUT LET'S NOT KID OURSELVES WE'RE NOT THAT WE'RE NOT THE LEADERS. SO YOU CAN SELECT A REGION WITH THIS TOOL SAY THE U. S. AND CANADA AND YOU CAN SELECT A PARTICULAR KIND OF TROPICAL WILL SELECT A CARGO VAN HERE AND YOU CAN SEE WHICH MANUFACTURES MAKE THIS TRUCK IN YOUR REGION. AND THEN YOU CAN SCROLL DOWN AND GO TO SUBMIT YOUR INFORMATION AND SUBMITTING CALLOUSED ARE AND THEY WILL HELP- THE CUSTOMER FIND THE TRUCK THAT YOU WANT SO THAT IS JUST TO SAY THAT NOT ONLY ARE THE TRUCKS HERE BUT THE TECHNOLOGY IS MOVING SO FAST THAT THERE'S A TOOL AVAILABLE TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE INTERESTED IN TRUCK DRIVERS AND FLEETS THAT ARE INTERESTED IN ELECTRIC VEHICLES. FIND THE RIGHT TRUCK FOR THEMSELVES I'M NOT GONNA PRETEND LIKE WE'RE NOT IN THE EARLY STAGES OF COMMERCIALIZATION BECAUSE WE ARE BUT SENATOR DOLLY SAID EARLIER YOU WERE ONLY FOURTEEN YEARS AWAY AND I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT FOURTEEN YEARS IS A VERY VERY LONG TIME AND IN THIS IN THIS WORLD AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN WHERE WE WERE FOURTEEN YEARS AGO ON ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION WHICH WAS PRETTY MUCH KNOW WHERE. AND WHERE WE ARE TODAY. IS PRETTY. THE AMAZING SO I JUST WANT I WANT TO MAKE SURE IT KNEW THAT THERE WAS TOOL THERE AND THEN I ALSO PROVIDE HOPEFULLY YOU HAVE IT A HANDOUT. FOR THE COMMITTEE TO CONSIDER BECAUSE A LOT OF TIMES. PEOPLE POINT TO THE GRID AS A CHALLENGE TO ELECTRIFICATION. AND I JUST WANT TO. SHE SAID THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF STUDIES AND SOME OF THEM ARE LAID OUT IN YOUR HAND OUT. THAT SHOW THAT LEAKING THESE TRUCKS TO THE GRAND CAN BE A TREMENDOUS BENEFIT FOR THE GREG. FOR SAFETY FOR A LIABILITY AS WE WORK ON RESILIENCY AND COMBATING WILDFIRES THESE TRUCKS CONNECTING TO THE GRID CAN MAKE OUR GRID MORE RESILIENT PARTICULARLY AS- THE FLEET TURNS OVER RATHER SLOWLY SO THERE IS THIS KIND OF GRADUAL TURNOVER IN THE FLEET. AND THIS IS NOT A NEW CHALLENGE FOR UTILITIES- THE UTILITY INDUSTRY THE GRID ITSELF IS AN ENGINEERING. FEAT THAT IS EVER OF ALL- AND SO THIS KIND OF NEW LOAD IS NOT NEW FOR THE GRANT WE HAVE. IT THAT THESE KINDS OF CHALLENGES ARE NOT NEW IN FACT THEY CAN OFTEN BE. BENEFICIAL TO THE GREAT AND ALL CUSTOMERS WHO USE ELECTRICITY WHETHER OR NOT YOU DRIVE A TRUCK. SO FOR JUST TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OVER THE LAST DECADE. MARGARET IN CALIFORNIA HAS SHIFTED SUBSTANTIALLY TO A RELIANCE ON RENEWABLE RESOURCES SOLAR AND WIND HEADED HAVE EXPANDED. ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN THE STATE HAVE X. HAS EXPANDED SO THIS TRANSITION CAN NOT ONLY BE ON BE. BENEFIT THE GREAT BUT IT IS POSSIBLE IN PART BECAUSE BECAUSE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT A GRADUAL TRANSITION AND IT ISN'T A NEW THIS IS NOT NEW TO WORK FOR THE GREAT. SO I DON'T WANT TO UNDERESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WE HAVE TO DO NOT JUST TO BRING ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND CONNECT THEM. TO THE GRANT BUT ACTUALLY ALL OF OUR EFFORTS TO ADAPT TO CLIMATE CHANGE. AND COMBAT WILDFIRES WHILE ALSO MAKING SURE THAT ELECTRICITY IN CALIFORNIA IS MORE AFFORDABLE AND SAFE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SO I GUESS I WOULD JUST CLOSE BY SAYING WHEN YOU HEAR THINGS LIKE- YOU KNOW THE GREAT CAN'T HANDLE THIS OR THERE ARE ALL THESE GREAT CHALLENGES. I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE EVERYONE TO USE PLEASE TALK TO UTILITIES TO THE EXPERTS TO THE ENGINEERS WHO WHO KNOWS THE FACTS SO YES WE DO WE ARE FACING A LOT OF CHALLENGES IN CALIFORNIA. THEY ARE LARGELY DUE TO CLIMATE CHANGE BUT I WOULD POSIT THAT ELECTRIC VEHICLES CONNECTING TO THE GRID ARE PART OF THE SOLUTION AND- I'M NOT THE HYDROGEN PERSON BUT I THINK HYDROGEN IS ALSO ELECTRIC VEHICLE ON THEIR TREMENDOUS- THAT. STORAGE CAPACITY SESSION WITH HYDROGEN SO THESE VEHICLES ACTUALLY CAN SUPPORT OUR GREAT EFFORTS AND THEY'RE COMING ONLINE FASTER THAN ANYONE EXPECTED WITH TECHNOLOGY AND DATA ENHANCEMENTS THAT WE HAVE NOT SEEN BEFORE SO WE HAVE CHALLENGES. THAT THERE'S A LOT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DO NOT. AND ACTUALLY YOU BACK TO A LOT VERY VERY AGGRESSIVELY IN SUPPORTING THIS TRANSITION SO I WANT TO THANK YOU GONZALEZ FOR INVITING ME I HOPE THAT YOU FIND A HANDOUT USEFUL AND CONSIDER US A RESOURCE. FOR TO ANY QUESTIONS OR FURTHER INTERACTIONS WITH THE SCRIPT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR WE APPRECIATE. YOU BEING HERE IN YOUR TIME AS WELL. EIGHT THAT- CONTROL OUR PANEL. AND BEFORE I GO TO MY QUESTIONS I JUST WANT TO THANK THE PRESENTERS ALL OF THREE PANELS THAT SPOKE FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES- NOW TIME WE WANTED AFTER WE TAKE A QUESTIONS FROM THE SENATORS I'D LIKE TO ENSURE THAT WE ALSO- A LOT TIME FOR PUBLIC COMMENT SUGGEST. L. ONE OTHER REMINDER TO PARTICIPATE PLEASE CALL THE TOLL FREE NUMBER ONE EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE. FOUR ONE EIGHT FIVE. THAT ACCESS CODE IS. NINE FOUR ONE SEVEN FIVE ONE. I WE WANT TO HEAR FROM YOU BUT PLEASE LIMIT YOUR COMMENTS TO ONE MINUTE AND AGAIN WE WILL TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT AFTER SENATOR QUESTIONS I HAVE SENATOR ARE TO LET A FIRST. THANK YOU AN OBSCURE I'D LIKE TO- COMMENT AND THANK- ARE VERY LAST. A PRESENTER IT BECAUSE SHE BROUGHT BACK. MY INITIAL STATEMENT WAS. HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY AS WE OPEN THAT TREASURE CHEST WE HAVE TO INCLUDE EVERYTHING AND I THINK THAT WAS. THE GIST WEATHERED BE ELECTRIC FUEL CELL ENERGY WHATEVER IT IS NATURAL GAS IT ALL HAS TO BE PART. OF OUR TREASURE CHEST OF ENERGY TO GO FORWARD WITH OUR GOAL ZERO EMISSION. BUT I'D LIKE TO GO BACK TO OUR PANELISTS MISS COOK. IN REFERENCE TO. THE HYDROGEN. IT SEEMS THAT THE HYDROGEN. TO BE THE ANSWER FOR NUMBER OF HEAVY DUTY AND OFF ROAD APPLICATIONS HAVING SAID THAT- HOW CAN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HOW COULD THE INDUSTRY WORKED TO BRING THE HYDROGEN FUEL CELL PRICES DOWN- TO A REGIONAL ABOUT ANYWHERE NEAR THAT MARKET- NUMBER OF THAT GREAT MARKET NUMBER WOULD KICK RULING THINGS OFF. AT SIX DOLLARS A KILOGRAM. YES THAT WOULD. ANOTHER GREAT QUESTION SENATOR- SO I FULLY AGREE THAT WE CAN GET SPEND MUCH TIME ON THE WAY VISUAL OF ALL THE NEW PRODUCTION COMING INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH IS VERY VERY EXCITING. FOR A LONG TIME I THINK WE'VE BEEN KINDA HIT WITH- YOU KNOW FRUSTRATION ABOUT RELIANCE ON OUT OF STATE- ISSUED SO THAT A LOT AND YOU KNOW CREATING AND- STATE WHERE. THESE SORTS OF ALTERNATIVE FUELS ARE MOST WELCOME AND Q. AND YOU KNOW USE THAT OPPORTUNITY WITH THE HYDROGEN HUB. USE THE GOOD WORK AT THE SCENE CARE BE DOING AND GO BAD ARGUING TO CREATE NEW PRODUCTION SITES THROUGHOUT THE STATE SO THAT WE HAVE PRODUCTION IN LINE TO SUPPORT THE NEXT GENERATION OF HYDROGEN APPLICATION THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT LIKE RAIL AND MARINE AVIATION AND A OT. OF STUFF. I HAVEN'T YOU KNOW WE HAVE BEEN NEED ABOUT THE IDEA. INVESTMENT TAX CREDIT- BEING SORT OF A SHOT IN THE ARM SHOULD THAT PRODUCTION INDUSTRY ESPECIALLY WHEN WE WANT TO PRIORITIZE RENEWABLE HYDROGEN PRODUCTION. IT IS A LITTLE BIT MORE COSTLY BUT IF THEY'RE YOU KNOW LIKE A KEY. ISSUE FOR OUR INDUSTRY- YOU KNOW TO BRING TO MARKET SO YOU KNOW THAT TO BE A COUPLE OPTIONS. THAT OFFER FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU MA'AM TO GET INTO YOU TO CAN. TO ALL THE PANEL THEY'LL A GREAT JOB AND AT THE YOU FOR TIME AND ONCE AGAIN TO YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU FOR PUTTING THIS ALL TOGETHER. I THANK YOU CENTER ARCHULETA THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION SEVEN OR NEWMAN. THANK THANK YOU MEASURE GOD COULD VERY QUICK QUESTION FOR MISS COOK- IF YOU COULD PLEASE EXPAND BRIEFLY ON YOU DOWN THE POINT YOU KNOW IT WHICH IS THE INTERRELATIONSHIP OF THE INTERDEPENDENCY. BETWEEN THE LIGHT DUTY AND HEAVY DUTY BUT WHILE ALSO- SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOWARD THE PROCESS OF GREENING HYDROGEN- AS WE GET TO SCALE. ON THIS PLATFORM. ABSOLUTELY AND I DID LOOK THROUGH THAT PRETTY QUICKLY IT'S GOOD TO HAVE PLAYED DOWN AND FADE AGAIN. STILL IN CALIFORNIA AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT TWENTY EIGHT MILLION LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES ARE GOING AROUND AND WE'VE GOT ABOUT A MILLION HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. AND WHAT WE FOUND FROM THE AUTO MANUFACTURER PERSPECTIVE. INSIDES INVESTING IN THE FACILITIES THERE- I. PROJECT. THAT DEVELOPED. HE WILL TELL FOR A LADY MARIAH AT A OLD WHEN PRODUCED A LOT OF. FOR A LOT LADIES VEHICLE FAILED. BACK IN ASK DRAWS DOWN THE CAR OF COMPONENTS IN THE COMPONENT IN THE HEAVY DUTY FREE MAKING NOT EQUIPMENT LESS COSTLY WHICH BRINGS DOWN THE OVERALL PRICE AT KNOW WHAT NEEDS TO HELP PRODUCT- THIRTY KILOGRAM- FUEL TANK ON BOARD BURST IS A FIVE KILOGRAM TANK ON A LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE SO WHEN WE CONSIDERED THE DEMAND FOR HYDROGEN FUEL THAT GOING TO COMPROMISE THE HEAVY DUTY MARKET. NEEDING TO REFILL A THIRTY KILOGRAM TANK THAT'S GOING TO CREATE A DEMAND ON HYDROGEN FUEL THAT ENCOURAGES PRODUCTION AND THEN NOT DRIVE DOWN COSTS. FOR HYDROGEN IT'S ALWAYS ABOUT SCALING WHETHER YOU'RE SCALING BE A QUICK MENTION WHETHER YOU'RE SCALING THE PRODUCTION OF FUEL THE STATE ADMINISTRATION DOC WHEN YOU START TO UNLOCK. COST BENEFIT AND THEN WE MOVED TO A PLACE OF BEING EVENTUALLY SELF SUFFICIENT AND NOT NEEDING. TO BE CONTINUALLY UPSET I'D- I AND THEN YOUR QUESTION ABOUT. ACTIVELY THE GREY. VERY GOOD DISCUSSION WHERE I I'M ARE BOARD CHER ONE I'M IN THE FIRST HAND ALL ABOUT THE DIFFERENT RENEWABLE PRODUCTION PATHWAY SO YOU HAVE THE ELECTROLYTIC HYDROGEN ELECTROLYTES HERS AT THAT POINT IN THE MARKET ARE NOT COMMERCIALLY AVAILABLE THEY ARE IN THEIR VERY EARLY STAGES- I SORT OF DEMONSTRATION AND DEVELOPMENT SO I WOULD NOT IN THAT MOMENT POINTED THAT OUT AS THE PRIMARY MEANS TO MAKE YOU'LL CONCRETE IMMEDIATELY ARE COST COMPETITIVE IMMEDIATELY. BUT YOU HAVE TO EITHER HYDROGEN PRODUCTION PATHWAYS THAT ARE CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE UNDER THE LOW CARBON FUEL STANDARD WHICH IS THE PROGRAM THAT WE KIND OF YOU KNOW THAT OURSELVES ACCORDING TO WITH OUR NORTH STARKEY WELL I'M AND HAVE BOTH OF THOSE PRODUCTION PATHWAYS RELY ON ORGANIC WASTE AGRICULTURAL WASTE- YOU KNOW LANDFILLS AND MUNICIPAL WASTE THOSE STREAMS. ARE YOU KNOW AND AS WE DISCUSSED EARLIER LEFT UNTOUCHED ARE JUST GOING TO RESULT IN GREATER AND GREATER METHANE EMISSIONS BUT AS CALIFORNIA'S OWN SHORT LIVED CLIMATE POLLUTANT BILL AND THEN I DIDN'T ADMINISTRATION AND ACTION PLAN FOR METHANE REDUCTION THOSE TWO PRODUCTION PATHWAYS ARE INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO PRESERVE AND SO THE POINT THAT I WAS HOPING TO MAKE EARLIER IS SOMETIMES THERE'S A LOT OF PUSHBACK ON HYDROGEN BECAUSE CURRENTLY WE RELY ON YOU KNOW CREDIT FOR OUT OF STATE. BUT I THINK THAT THE TEMPORARY ISSUE AND THE THING THAT'S GOING TO RESOLVE BACK IN HAVING OUR OWN IN STATE PRODUCTION BUILT OUR OWN STATE RENEWABLE PRODUCTION BUILT OUT AND THEN WE'RE NO LONGER YOU KNOW INSERTED THAT PUSH AND PULL AND WE CAN STAND BY YOU KNOW OUR OUR IN STATE VERY CLEAR READY WILL ALL PRODUCE HYDROGEN. AND FORMER HAD. ENTER YOUR- THAT DOES A DE AS SELF CHAIR THE HARSH AND CAUCUS I THINK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR NEWMAN US OPEN CHAIR LEFT- I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE QUESTIONS DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MIKES BUT I DO HAVE A FEW TO BILL OFF THE- LAST ONE RELATED TO HYDROGEN I MEAN WE TALKED A LOT YOU. YOU BUT A LOT OF- EXAMPLES THANK YOU MISS COOK. BUT YOU KNOW WHEN WE DIG DEEPER WE SEE THERE ARE OTHER. ELEMENTS THAT BECAUSE- I GUESS SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF STORAGE ISSUES TRANSPORT ISSUES ENERGY EFFICIENCY ISSUES. AND SO I'D LIKE TO TALK THROUGH THAT A% LITTLE BIT JUST TO GET. A SORT OF AGLOBAL PICTURE OF WHAT- THE STATUS OF HYDROGEN IS CURRENTLY IN AND WHY IT'S- I GUESS SO FAR BEHIND IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW IF WE ARE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT. OTHER- TECHNOLOGIES. AND HOW THE LEGISLATURE CAN WILL CONTINUE TO WEIGH IN I MEAN OBVIOUSLY WERE WEIGHING IN NOW BUT HOW LONG CAN WE- LOOK AT HYDROGEN IN THE DIFFERENT LANDS RELATED TO THOSE ISSUES. BUT A GREAT QUESTION- AND SO. I WANT TO POINT TO SOMETHING THAT I NEED TYPED THAT WHICH WAS IN RESPONSE TO THE COMMENT MADE BY SENATOR DOLLY ABOUT FOURTEEN YEARS BEING A LONG WAY AWAY. AND YOU KNOW HYDROGEN AND THE YOUNGEST OF OUR FAMILY HERE- AND SO YOU KNOW WE ARE AS I MENTIONED AND NOT PRE COMMERCIAL PHAE- SO I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW GIVE US A LITTLE BIT OF TIME. TO PROVE OUT THE APPLICATION OF THE VEHICLES AND THEN ONCE WE START TO FEED. MY BAND HARM FOR DEATH TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS THAT'S WHEN PRIVATE INVESTMENT START TO COME TO MARKET. AND BE YOU KNOW COSTS COME DOWN DISTRIBUTION ISSUES INVESTED AND- YOU KNOW I TAKE YOUR POINT WELL DIED IN THE MARKET RIGHT NOW. AND WE DO HAVE A PRODUCTION PROBLEM WE HAVE THAT WE HAVE AN AVAILABILITY OF FUEL PROBLEM IN OUT OF SOMETHING THAT I'M COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN MENTIONED IN HER TESTIMONY AND- THAT IS ALSO WHY I'M SO EXCITED. ABOUT THE INCREASED PRODUCTION THAT COMING TO CALIFORNIA. EHRLICH HE'D WILL BE OPENING AT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR PRODUCTION FACILITY. THAT IS- PRETTY THING THIRTY KILOGRAMS OF- EXCUSE ME THIRTY TONS OF RENEWABLE HYDROGEN PER DAY. THAT WOULD SUPPORT FORTY TWO THOUSAND LIGHT DUTY VEHICLE OR ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES OR- YOU KNOW ABOUT SIXTY THOUSAND FOR CLASS AND THAT'S NOT BE ONLY. THIRTY TIME PER DAY PROJECT THAT COMING TO THE WEST COAST WE DON'T HAVE A PROJECT UNDER DEVELOPMENT RIGHT NOW AND SO. I GUESS I WOULD ASK SENATOR FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF PATIENCE I NEED- YOU KNOW KIND OF. GET THROUGH OUR AWKWARD TEENAGE YEARS IF YOU WILL SO THAT WE ARE ABLE TO COMPETE IN THE MARKET. I'M AND THEN OTHER RELIEF TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY YOU KNOW THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE. HEAR AN AWFUL LOT THAT. YOU KNOW- HYDROGEN THEN YOU KNOW I FOR AND IT NOT THE HIGH IN USE THAT AT THAT- I THINK WE'RE MEANT THE- OF THE POINT IS WHAT ARE CAN HUMOR. GOING TEN NEEDED WHAT ARE TRUCK DRIVERS GOING TO NEED WATER THE PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS THAT WE AS AS AS AUTOMAKERS. HAVE BEEN DELIVERED CANNOT. AND INSTEAD OF YOU KNOW KIND OF GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY ARGUMENT I THINK IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO STAY FOCUSED ON WE HAVE A YOU KNOW TWENTY NINE MILLION DRIVERS AND YOU NEED TO GET THEM VEHICLES THAT CAN MEET ALL OF THEIR DEMANDS- WITH MINIMAL SACRIFICES HYDROGEN AND THE ONE TO ONE REPLACEMENT. FOR GASOLINE AND I THINK WE CAN DO THAT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I APPRECIATE APPRECIATE THAT ANSWER- MISS COOK- AND THEN MY NEXT QUESTION IS FOR- IS RIGHTS RELATED TO- AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR PRESENTATION AS WELL. I THINK IN IN ONE OF YOUR- FLYERS HERE IT HAD MENTIONED WHAT COULD BE ACHIEVED WITH A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. AND IT IT DEPICTS OF THE NUMBER OF VEHICLES FUNDED OF VERSES. FOUR TIMES MORE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC SO TO WHO. I GUESS YOUR SCENARIO HERE IS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO RENEWABLE NATURAL GAS- TRUCKS. VERSUS SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS. AND SO. WHAT IS THE COST DIFFERENTIAL I KNOW AGAIN THAT'S BEEN A QUESTION WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THROUGH THESE PANELS BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE IN THIS IS JUST ON THE VEHICLES OF COURSE NOT. YOU KNOW RETROFITTING OR A CHANGING OF ANY OTHER- FUELING STATIONS BUT WHAT DOES THAT LOOK LIKE GIVE US A PICTURE- OF WHAT- THIS ACTUALLY MEANS. THANK YOU MA'AM CHAIR SO IF YOU'RE ASKING THE COST DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN. THE DIFFERENT TECHNOLOGIES IN THE DIFFERENT VEHICLES. SO FOR- A DIESEL LIKE I USED TO DIESEL VEHICLE YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT- SIXTY TO EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A TRUCK- AND YOU CAN WE ARE VERY COMPARABLE TO THAT FOR NATURAL GAS IT DOESN'T USE VEHICLES IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT A NEW. AND IS ON TRACK THAT'S NEED BE- CLOSE TO LIKE MAYBE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND- AND WE ARE VERY COMPARABLE TO THAT. BUT ONCE YOU'RE GETTING TO YOU OTHER TECHNOLOGIES I'M YOU'RE LOOKING AT TWO TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT. OF THAT CLASS WITH THOSE TRACKS AND THAT WAS MENTIONED EARLIER TODAY AS WELL THAT YOU TO THREE TIMES THE AMOUNT- AND THEN AND THEN WHEN YOU GET TO USE THE HYDROGEN SHOTS. YOU'RE LOOKING AT SIGNIFICANT. COST INCREASES WELL. OKAY THANK YOU THAT- MAR FORMULA THAT YOU'RE MENTIONING IS WHAT IS THE HERE IN THIS- THAT THIS FIRE BECAUSE YOU ALSO- INCLUDE THAT THE KNOX REDUCTION ANNUALLY COULD BE- ONE HUNDRED THIRTY NINE POINT FIVE TONNES WHICH IS FIVE TIMES MORE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC. IS THAT CORRECT. I'M SORRY MADAM CHAIR I WAS PULLING UP NOT TALKING IT'S LIKE IT'S- NOT JUST GIVE ME A SECOND LET ME PULL THAT. IS NOT ON MY SCREEN. OKAY AND CAN YOU ASK THE QUESTION AGAIN I'M HERE YES THANK YOU I THINK THAT- LEAFLET IS- TITLED CALIFORNIA HAS THE WORST AIR POLLUTION IN THE NATION AND DIESEL TRUCKS ARE LARGELY TO BLAME. AND THERE ARE ON THE BOTTOM LEFT IS FIVE TIMES MORE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS THE BASED ON THE SCENARIO OF. TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED TWENTY TWO A NATURAL GAS TRUCKS ON THE ROAD VERSUS SIX HUNDRED SIXTY SEVEN BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS I GUESS YOU'RE COMING UP WITH THE SCENARIO THAT YOU WOULD REDUCE. KNOCKS ANNUALLY ABOUT. FIVE TIMES MORE THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC TRUCKS. THAT THAT IS CORRECT OKAY AND THEN GHG REDUCED ANNUALLY WOULD BE ABOUT FOUR TIMES MORE- THAN BATTERY ELECTRIC AS WELL. THAT IS CORRECT AND THAT'S ALL BASED ON A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT. CORRECT WE WERE TO DO THAT NOW OKAY DO YOU SEE AN ANY ADDITIONAL I KNOW LAST YEAR- WE HAD WORKED ON- A FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THAT WAS ENACTED THROUGH- OUR BUDGET ACTION. AND SO. THIS YEAR I IT LOOKS LIKE I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT YOU'RE LOOKING FOR IS IN ADDITIONAL. BECAUSE I THINK WHAT IS. FROM WHAT I'M HEARING FROM THE PUBLIC IS. IN WHAT I'VE ASKED BEFORE IS WHAT IS THE ACTUAL- INAPPROPRIATE INVESTMENT FOR THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND I THINK I OFTENTIMES ARE LOOKED AT AS QUOTE UNQUOTE BRIDGE TECHNOLOGIES. AGAIN WITH THE SEVEN TO TEN YEAR STRATEGY HORIZON WHILE WE'RE ALSO SIMULTANEOUSLY LOOKING AT IMPROVING THE INNOVATIONS FOR ZERO EMISSION. IS THAT YOUR UNDERSTANDING AS WELL AND WHAT OTHER. DOLLARS WOULD YOU BE- ADVOCATING FOR FROM THE STATE LEGISLATURE. YES WELL- SO WE FIRST OF ALL AND NURTURE WE WOULDN'T CHARACTERIZE THIS AS A BRIDGE TECHNOLOGY WE THINK THAT THIS IS A TECHNOLOGY THAT IS AVAILABLE AS I SAID IN MY TESTIMONY TO HELP THE STATE MEET BOTH AIR QUALITY AND CLIMATE CHANGE GOALS. SERVICE TECHNOLOGY IS AVAILABLE TO CONTINUE TO RUN- YOU KNOW IT S. AS LONG AS IT IS NEEDED AND PROVIDING THOSE EMISSION REDUCTIONS INSTANCE ON THE IN THE DOCUMENT. CARE ACT YOU KNOW NINETY PLUS PERCENT EMISSION REDUCTIONS IN CHIEF FOR OR NOT NO 100% AND EMISSIONS FOR DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER SO- SO WE DON'T CHARACTERIZE IT AS THAT- HOWEVER. FOR THE INVESTMENT INVESTMENT DOLLARS IN THE INCENTIVES- THAT SUPPORT OF THIS TECHNOLOGY WHICH IS NOW ONLY THROUGH ONE PROGRAM WHICH IS THE CALL MORE YOUR PROGRAM. AND WE WERE IN A VARIETY OF OTHER PROGRAMS- OVER THE YEARS THAT HAVE. SUBSEQUENTLY BEEN AND JUST PROVIDED RESOURCES FOR INCENTIVE CREDITS AND DOLLARS THRILLED THE CARMELITA PROGRAM BUT THAT'S REALLY TO HELP WITH THE COST DIFFERENTIAL FOR THE VEHICLES THAT WE JUST TALKED ABOUT AND REALLY GOES TO SUPPORT. THESE SMALL FLEET OWNERS THOSE WHO HAVE YOU KNOW TWO OR FIVE OR TEN TRACKS WHERE I'M TURNING THOSE TRUCKS OVER ISSUE A CLEANER TECHNOLOGY MIGHT BE PERSONALLY DESIRABLE BUT A LOT OF TIMES IT'S NOT FEASIBLE ECONOMICALLY. SO WE WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE STATE CONTINUES TO TAKE ON FRANKLY AT TECHNOLOGY NEUTRAL APPROACH Q. INCENTIVIZING. THE USE OF THESE TECHNOLOGIES CONSIDER BOTH NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM STRATEGY AND AS FAR AS DOLLAR AMOUNTS AS YOU MENTIONED THE FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS THAT WAS PROVIDED AS A BUDGET ALLOCATION LAST YEAR. ACCORDING TO YOU AND THE DISTRICT A SOUTH. COAST AT&amp;T- EARLIER TODAY. WHERE DOES THE ARE WITH THE SOUND OFF VALLEY. AMERICAN SOLUTION CONTROLLED. WOULD ALSO FROM THOSE WE- THAT COULD- DISPLAYS ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED AND FIFTY TRUCKS IN THE DESPERATE SO IT'S CERTAINLY NOT AND YOU KNOW IT'S NOT AS MUCH RESOURCES AS WOULD BE NEEDED FOR A THOUSAND TRAFFIC THE DISPLACED. BUT IT STARTS MAKING PROGRESS AND FOR THE REASONS THAT THE STATE WITH THEIR FEDERAL AT THE TEAM MADE MANDATE IS IMPORTANT- SO THAT GOES TO SHOW THAT JUST FORTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS HOW SIGNIFICANT THAT IMPACT COULD BE. SO BEING ABLE TO YOU ALLOCATE RESOURCES ACCORDING TO YOU AIR QUALITY AND EMISSIONS REDUCTION GOALS FOR THE NEAR TERM AND THE LONG TERM IS THE BEST WAY THAT THE STATE COULD PRIORITIZE HOW THOSE INVESTMENTS GO. AND AGAIN TO SUPPORT HELP ME- SMALL LEADS AS WELL AS LARGER FLEET OWNERS START MAKING THE CHOICES FOR CLEAN TECHNOLOGY THAT WE KNOW THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE. BUT MIGHT BE HAVING FINANCIAL DIFFICULTY AND- CONSOLE. GREAT THANK YOU MISTER APRIL THAT AND I THINK MY HURTS A CALL. A FOLLOW UP FROM OUR A RESOURCE BOARD IT'S JUST GONNA COME THANK YOU. SURE THANK YOU SIR I AM CARDS DEPUTY FOR MOBILE SOURCES AND INCENTIVES THAT'S ONE OF REFLECT IN A FEW OF THE THINGS YOU'VE HEARD. THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL THING TO SAY IS THERE ABOUT A MILLION TRUCKS IN CALIFORNIA SO WE'RE REALLY TALKING ABOUT IS NOT FUNDS TO REPLACE ALL THOSE TRUCKS HAVE TO SPEND LIMITED STATE FUNDS. AND THEN THE ANSWER IS REALLY CLEAR COMBUSTION WHETHER NATURAL GAS OR DIESEL IS NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER THE BOX THAT. THE STATE HAS INVESTED OVER BILLION DOLLARS ALREADY I'M IN COMMERCIALIZING NATURAL GAS VEHICLES THAT'S A SUCCESS. THEY'RE AVAILABLE TODAY IN OUR DISTRICTS ROUTINE DISCRETION TO FUND THEM SO NO ONE'S QUESTION WHETHER THE MONEY'S OUT THERE. I THINK ONE REASON WHY THE CHAIR SO HEAVILY EMPHASIZE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IS THAT WE THINK ABOUT HOW TO INVEST LIMITED FUNDS AS THE L. A. O. IS OBSERVED. WE REALLY NEED TO THINK ABOUT IF YOU SEE ONE OF THOSE IS HOW IS EQUITY SO HOW DEEPLY CAN WE INVEST IN TRUCKS THAT WILL STAY ON THE ROAD FOR YEARS TO COME IMPACTING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. THAT REALLY MEANS GETTING ZEROS WE HEARD MISTER LOGAN. ANOTHER IS THE TIMING INVOLVED WHICH IS TO SAY AS BOTH A REGULATORY PROGRAMS RAMP UP AND AS MANUFACTURERS INVEST MORE ANY VIS MATCH OF OUR STRATEGY IS ENSURING THAT WE ARE. INVESTING ONE FUNDS WE HAVE ACCELERATING THAT TRANSITION. ALL OF WHICH IS TO SAY. AND FINALLY I WOULD JUST LIMITED QUANTITY OF RENEWABLE. GAS AND THEY'LL BE REAL QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER GOES INTO INDUSTRY ORANGE TRANSPORTATION THE FUTURE. TO RECONSIDER WHERE WE'RE GOING HERE I JUST WANNA PROVIDE A LITTLE BIT OF THAT PERSPECTIVE. THAT'S ONE REASON MY CARB IS EXCITED ABOUT HIS BUDGET PROPOSALS. AND GIVEN THAT THEY HELP BUILD ON EXISTING SUCCESSES NO ONE'S TAKING. ON COMBUSTION VEHICLES OFF THE TABLE. IN TERMS OF WHERE NEW FUNDS ARE NEEDED I WILL SAY THIS IS A MARKET WHERE WE REALLY CAN SUPPORT. ON A GREAT MANY ADVANCES IN ZERO EMISSION TECHNOLOGY THANKS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR US A CALL DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR MOBILE SERVICES AND INCENTIVES WE APPRECIATE YOUR- COMMENTARY THERE- I DON'T SEE ANY OTHER MIKES UP.
