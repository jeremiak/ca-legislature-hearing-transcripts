GOOD AFTERNOON.

01:01:02.025 --> 01:01:02.725
GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN BURRS

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:03.626
CHRISLEY ON BEHALF OF THE

01:01:03.693 --> 01:01:05.161
CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF

01:01:05.228 --> 01:01:06.062
COUNTIES REGRETTABLY IN

01:01:06.129 --> 01:01:07.430
OPPOSITION.

01:01:07.497 --> 01:01:08.698
I'M I THINK IN ALICE'S DOES A

01:01:08.765 --> 01:01:10.233
GOOD JOB OUTLINING SOME OF THE

01:01:10.299 --> 01:01:11.834
KEY CONCERNS THATWE'VE RAISED

01:01:11.901 --> 01:01:13.269
ABOUT THIS LEGISLATION BUT I

01:01:13.336 --> 01:01:15.238
THINK AN IMPORTANT ONE IS ALL OF

01:01:15.304 --> 01:01:16.105
THE DIFFERENCES I BELIEVE

01:01:16.172 --> 01:01:17.373
THERE'S TEN ENUMERATED IN THE

01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:18.274
ANALYSIS.

01:01:18.341 --> 01:01:20.743
BETWEEN THIS BILL AND BETWEEN

01:01:20.810 --> 01:01:21.711
TWENTY EIGHT NINETY WHICH ALSO

01:01:21.778 --> 01:01:23.079
I'M WAS PASSED OUT OF THE

01:01:23.146 --> 01:01:24.313
COMMITTEE EARLIER THIS YEAR.

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:26.082
I'M ONE OF THE KEY DIFFERENCES

01:01:26.149 --> 01:01:28.317
THAT I THINK IS OF CONCERN TO US

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:30.620
IS THE FACT THAT S. B. THREE ONE

01:01:30.686 --> 01:01:32.121
INCLUDES LANGUAGE THAT SINCE

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.656
ESSENTIALLY TURNS THE EXITS WE

01:01:33.723 --> 01:01:34.490
DRAWING UNIT.

01:01:34.557 --> 01:01:37.193
LAW ON ITS HEAD REQUIRING

01:01:37.260 --> 01:01:39.962
BASICALLY AN OPT OUT APPROACH IN

01:01:40.029 --> 01:01:42.265
TERMS OF AREAS WHERE THERE ARE

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:45.368
SAFETY OR OTHER HAZARDS WHERE WE

01:01:45.435 --> 01:01:46.469
DON'T WANT TO INTENSIFY

01:01:46.536 --> 01:01:48.237
RESIDENTIAL USES.

01:01:48.304 --> 01:01:49.739
AND THE REASON THAT'S ESPECIALLY

01:01:49.806 --> 01:01:53.109
SIGNIFICANT IS BECAUSE THIS BILL

01:01:53.176 --> 01:01:54.710
SAYS THAT THOSE LIMITED

01:01:54.777 --> 01:01:56.746
RESTRICTIONS IN TERMS OF WHERE

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.548
THERE'S A HEALTH AND SAFETY AREA

01:01:58.614 --> 01:01:59.482
FOR INSTANCE IF THERE'S A HIGH

01:01:59.549 --> 01:02:01.350
FIRE HAZARD SEVERITY AREA IF

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:02.452
THERE'S AN AREA THAT'S PRONE TO

01:02:02.518 --> 01:02:03.619
LANDSLIDES.

01:02:03.686 --> 01:02:05.221
RIGHT NOW ALL OF THOSE AREAS CAN

01:02:05.288 --> 01:02:07.056
DO YOU BUY RIGHT CONVERSIONS

01:02:07.123 --> 01:02:09.525
WITH IN EXISTING SPACE BUT WHAT

01:02:09.592 --> 01:02:11.227
THIS BILL DOES IS EXPANDS THAT

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:13.396
BY RIGHT PROCESS TO UP TO TWO

01:02:13.463 --> 01:02:15.665
UNITS FOR OUTSIDE OF AND MULTI

01:02:15.731 --> 01:02:16.966
FAMILY BUILDING.

01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.301
AND FOR STANDALONE EIGHTY YOU SO

01:02:18.367 --> 01:02:19.836
IT'S INCONSISTENT WITH A LOT OF

01:02:19.902 --> 01:02:21.370
THE PROVISIONS THAT HAVE BEEN

01:02:21.437 --> 01:02:22.839
INCLUDED IN THE LOCAL ORDINANCES

01:02:22.905 --> 01:02:25.274
THAT HAVE BEEN ADOPTED SINCE THE

01:02:25.341 --> 01:02:25.875
TWENTY SIXTEEN LEGISLATION IS

01:02:25.942 --> 01:02:26.576
PASSED.

01:02:26.642 --> 01:02:28.478
I'M ANOTHER AREA OF CONTENTION

01:02:28.544 --> 01:02:30.179
THAT WE HAVE WITH THE AUTHOR IS

01:02:30.246 --> 01:02:31.514
ABOUT THE IMPOSITION OF LIMITS

01:02:31.581 --> 01:02:33.449
ON PARCEL SIZE AND FOR RURAL

01:02:33.516 --> 01:02:35.118
COUNTIES AND FOR SMALLER CITIES

01:02:35.184 --> 01:02:37.320
AND PLACES WHERE WE DON'T HAVE

01:02:37.386 --> 01:02:39.422
URBAN OF WATER AND SEWER SYSTEMS

01:02:39.489 --> 01:02:40.957
BUT RATHER PEOPLE USE WELL AND

01:02:41.023 --> 01:02:41.657
SEPTIC.

01:02:41.724 --> 01:02:43.259
THOSE PARCEL SIZE LIMITATIONS

01:02:43.326 --> 01:02:44.460
ARE IMPORTANT TO MAKE SURE

01:02:44.527 --> 01:02:45.628
THERE'S NOT A HEALTH AND SAFETY

01:02:45.695 --> 01:02:48.498
IMPACT TO WATER SUPPLY.

01:02:48.564 --> 01:02:48.998
AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT

01:02:49.065 --> 01:02:50.633
SCREENING CRITERIA BECAUSE

01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.135
WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN IS IF YOU

01:02:52.201 --> 01:02:54.237
REMOVE PARCEL SIZE LIMITATIONS

01:02:54.303 --> 01:02:55.638
IN THOSE CONTACTS PEOPLE ARE

01:02:55.705 --> 01:02:56.973
GOING TO COME INTO THE PERMIT

01:02:57.039 --> 01:02:58.174
COUNTER THINKING THEY CAN GET

01:02:58.241 --> 01:02:59.142
AND EIGHTY YOU.

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.109
THAT'S REALLY NOT GONNA BE IN

01:03:00.176 --> 01:03:01.511
MINISTERIAL PROCESS ANYMORE

01:03:01.577 --> 01:03:03.312
BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO LOOK

01:03:03.379 --> 01:03:05.081
ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS AT THE

01:03:05.148 --> 01:03:06.883
SEPTIC AT THE WELL AND SO YOU'RE

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.217
SETTING PEOPLE UP.

01:03:08.284 --> 01:03:10.753
I BELIEVE FOR DISAPPOINTMENT AND

01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:12.421
FOR A COSTLY ENDEAVOR WHEN WE

01:03:12.488 --> 01:03:14.390
KNOW THERE'S LEGITIMATE POLICY

01:03:14.457 --> 01:03:16.225
REASONS TO RESTRICT THE

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:18.928
PROLIFERATION OF SEPTIC TANKS ON

01:03:18.995 --> 01:03:20.530
IN AREAS WHERE THERE'S A HIGH

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:21.764
DENSITY OF THOSE.

01:03:21.831 --> 01:03:22.899
AND THE REASON WE KNOW THAT IS

01:03:22.965 --> 01:03:24.600
BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE

01:03:24.667 --> 01:03:25.768
THE STATE WATER RESOURCES

01:03:25.835 --> 01:03:28.304
CONTROL BOARD PASSED REGULATIONS

01:03:28.371 --> 01:03:30.473
ON RELATING TO ON SITE WATER

01:03:30.540 --> 01:03:32.542
TREATMENT SYSTEMS COUNTIES THAT

01:03:32.608 --> 01:03:33.776
HAVE INCLUDED PARCEL SIZE

01:03:33.843 --> 01:03:35.645
LIMITATIONS THE ORDINANCES.

01:03:35.711 --> 01:03:39.015
HAVE CONSIDERED THAT REQUIREMENT

01:03:39.081 --> 01:03:40.283
IN DEVELOPING THOSE OR THINK

01:03:40.349 --> 01:03:42.051
IT'S AGAINST GOOD PUBLIC POLICY

01:03:42.118 --> 01:03:43.953
TO COMPLETELY REMOVE PARCEL SIZE

01:03:44.020 --> 01:03:45.922
LIMITATIONS.

01:03:45.988 --> 01:03:47.290
ON WITHOUT I THINK I'LL.

01:03:47.356 --> 01:03:48.491
BUT AT THE LEAGUE OF CITIES TALK

01:03:48.558 --> 01:03:49.125
ABOUT THE OTHER CONCERNS

01:03:49.192 --> 01:03:49.425
[inaudible]

01:03:49.492 --> 01:03:51.360
THANK YOU.

01:03:51.427 --> 01:03:53.095
YES MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JASON

01:03:53.162 --> 01:03:54.764
RYAN LEE CALIFORNIA CITIES AND

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.499
WE ARE ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO

01:03:56.566 --> 01:03:57.667
THIS MEASURE.

01:03:57.733 --> 01:03:58.935
I'M I WOULD LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:03:59.001 --> 01:04:00.770
THAT EXISTING LAW IS ALREADY

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.538
VERY ROBUST WHEN IT COMES EIGHTY

01:04:02.605 --> 01:04:04.207
USE THANKS TO SOMEWHERE BLOOM

01:04:04.273 --> 01:04:05.174
AND CENTER WHITE HOUSE KEYS

01:04:05.241 --> 01:04:06.509
BILLS FROM TWO YEARS AGO.

01:04:06.576 --> 01:04:07.777
SO IT'S NOT AS IF WE DON'T HAVE

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:09.845
VERY RESTRICTIVE LAWS NOW ON

01:04:09.912 --> 01:04:11.447
WHAT CITIES CANNING CAN DO WITH

01:04:11.514 --> 01:04:13.049
REGARD TO REGULATE EIGHTY USE.

01:04:13.115 --> 01:04:15.551
AND THEY'RE ALSO VERY INCLUSIVE

01:04:15.618 --> 01:04:16.652
OF ALLOWING FOR NEED YOU TO BE

01:04:16.719 --> 01:04:19.121
CONSTRUCTED THE LEGISLATURE

01:04:19.188 --> 01:04:20.723
UMBEL IN TWO YEARS AGO I WAS

01:04:20.790 --> 01:04:22.458
VERY MINDFUL IN AND WANTING TO

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.960
RESTRICT SOME OF THE ACTIVITIES

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.695
OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SPUR.

01:04:25.761 --> 01:04:27.663
EIGHTY USE WE KNOW THE LAW IS

01:04:27.730 --> 01:04:29.332
WORKING AND IT'S WORKING VERY

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:31.601
WELL IN THE LAST YEAR ALONE LOS

01:04:31.667 --> 01:04:33.436
ANGELES HAS SEEN A TWENTY FIVE

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:35.471
TIMES INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:04:35.538 --> 01:04:36.105
EIGHTY PERMITS ISSUED.

01:04:36.172 --> 01:04:37.940
SANFRANCISCO HAS SEEN A TWELVE

01:04:38.007 --> 01:04:40.109
TIMES INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF

01:04:40.176 --> 01:04:41.577
EIGHTY YOU PERMITS ISSUED SO

01:04:41.644 --> 01:04:43.045
JUST SINGING VERY SHORT AMOUNT

01:04:43.112 --> 01:04:45.047
OF TIME WE KNOW THE LAWS WORKING.

01:04:45.114 --> 01:04:46.148
SO WE QUESTION WHY WE NEED TO

01:04:46.215 --> 01:04:47.650
TURN THE LAW ON ITS HEAD YET

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:49.518
AGAIN AND HAVE OUR CITIES AND

01:04:49.585 --> 01:04:51.320
COUNTIES GO THROUGH AN ORDINANCE

01:04:51.387 --> 01:04:52.688
PROCESS TO UPDATE THAT LAW

01:04:52.755 --> 01:04:54.523
THAT'S JUST BEEN ON THE BOOKS

01:04:54.590 --> 01:04:55.157
FOR TWO YEARS.

01:04:55.224 --> 01:04:56.292
AND WE'VE SEEN LEGISLATION LAST

01:04:56.359 --> 01:04:57.994
YEAR AND HE REALLY QUESTION WHY

01:04:58.060 --> 01:05:00.696
WE NEED.

01:05:00.763 --> 01:05:01.631
ANOTHER THING THAT WOULD LIKE TO

01:05:01.697 --> 01:05:03.032
HIGHLIGHT IS THAT THIS BILL IS

01:05:03.099 --> 01:05:04.467
ALLOWING FOR TWO EIGHTY USED TO

01:05:04.533 --> 01:05:05.768
BE ON A PARCEL ONE THAT CAN BE

01:05:05.835 --> 01:05:07.003
DETACHED ONE THAT.

01:05:07.069 --> 01:05:08.671
CAN BE ATTACHED TO THE HOME THIS

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:09.939
GOES BEYOND A THINK WHAT MOST

01:05:10.006 --> 01:05:11.173
PEOPLE ENVISIONED WHEN CITIES

01:05:11.240 --> 01:05:12.441
ARE GONNA BE RESTRICTED IN THEIR

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:13.109
ABILITY TO IMPOSE PARKING

01:05:13.175 --> 01:05:14.176
REGULATIONS.

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.311
WE'RE ADDING CONSIDERABLE

01:05:15.378 --> 01:05:16.445
DENSITY TOUR SINGLE FAMILY

01:05:16.512 --> 01:05:17.713
NEIGHBORHOODS WITHOUT ANY

01:05:17.780 --> 01:05:19.348
ABILITY FOR US TO IMPOSE PARKING

01:05:19.415 --> 01:05:20.116
RESTRICTIONS IF YOU'RE WITHIN A

01:05:20.182 --> 01:05:21.484
HALF MILE.

01:05:21.550 --> 01:05:23.319
OF A P. TRANSIT STOP OR OTHERS

01:05:23.386 --> 01:05:25.254
TO WRITE YOUR CAR NEARBY SO WE

01:05:25.321 --> 01:05:26.555
BELIEVE THIS MEASURE GOES WAY

01:05:26.622 --> 01:05:28.124
BEYOND WAS ENVISIONED NOT ONLY

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:29.091
FOR PARKING.

01:05:29.158 --> 01:05:30.526
BUT ALSO WE THINK OF EIGHTY USE

01:05:30.593 --> 01:05:31.494
WE THINK OF AS GRANNY FLATS ARE

01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.429
IN LAW QUARTERS ON THIS CAN BE

01:05:33.496 --> 01:05:34.864
USED WITHOUT THE OWNER OCCUPANCY

USED TO UNDERMINE STATE AID YOU

LAWS AND THE REASON THAT WE HAD

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:45.855
TO BRING OUR LEGISLATION IN THE

01:08:45.921 --> 01:08:49.592
FIRST PLACE WAS BECAUSE OF MANY

01:08:49.658 --> 01:08:50.025
CITIES HAD.

01:08:50.092 --> 01:08:53.395

TO WORK BY OTHER FOLKS --

COULD BE A NOT THE ONLY BUT A

01:09:12.014 --> 01:09:14.283
SIGNIFICANT SOLUTION TO OUR

THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

01:09:17.553 --> 01:09:20.689
AND IT'S PROVEN TO HAVE BEEN AND

01:09:20.756 --> 01:09:22.124
AN ACCURATE PREDICTION THAT

01:09:22.191 --> 01:09:22.892
WOULD BE VERY EFFECTIVE

THIS YEAR TO TAKE A PAUSE --

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:06.535

01:13:00.576 --> 01:13:02.010
BUT IT CAN'T BE BASED ON THE

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:03.545
PERCENTAGE OF THE EXISTING

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:05.581

TWELVE MINUTES AT THIS WAS

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:32.841
LANGUAGE THAT I ACCEPTED AS PART

01:13:32.908 --> 01:13:35.444
OF THAT NEGOTIATIONS IN THIS

01:13:35.511 --> 01:13:36.378
LONG JOURNEY.

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:37.980
CLINTON I THAT THAT ARE IN THEIR

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.381
CITY BUT THEY WANT TO SAY THAT A

01:13:39.448 --> 01:13:41.150
CITY COULDN'T STOP YOU OR

01:13:41.216 --> 01:13:43.519
COULDN'T YOU HAD A WRITER FOR IT

01:13:43.585 --> 01:13:45.420
EIGHT HUNDRED FOOT UNIT.

01:13:45.487 --> 01:13:46.555
IN THE SHORTER SO WE HAD TO DEAL

01:13:46.622 --> 01:13:47.956
WITH A BUILDING A GARAGE JUST

01:13:48.023 --> 01:13:50.025
THE SAME RIGHTS AS LIMITED --

01:13:50.092 --> 01:13:51.760
OKAY SO SOME OF THE OTHER ISSUES.

01:13:51.827 --> 01:13:53.729
HOW DOES THE WATER AND SEWER

01:13:53.796 --> 01:13:55.631
FEES GET COVERED I MEAN?

01:13:55.697 --> 01:13:57.332
AND BUILDING ANOTHER LIVINGS.

01:13:57.399 --> 01:13:59.334
STRUCTURE AND SOMEHOW OR OTHER

01:13:59.401 --> 01:14:01.470
THERE'S YOU KNOW.

01:14:01.537 --> 01:14:04.373
THE PERMITTING FEES OR THE

01:14:04.439 --> 01:14:07.075
HOOKUP FEES LIBERAL INVOLVED OF

01:14:07.142 --> 01:14:10.012
WATER AND SEWER HOOKUPS.

01:14:10.078 --> 01:14:11.413
WELL. TO YOUR FOCUS MY CITIES

01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:13.382
HAVE THEIR OWN WATER RECLAMATION

01:14:13.448 --> 01:14:15.150
AND TREATMENT.

01:14:15.217 --> 01:14:17.119
SO TWO YEARS AGO I WAS BEFORE

01:14:17.186 --> 01:14:19.154
THIS COMMITTEE AND WE HAD A BILL

01:14:19.221 --> 01:14:20.622
THE TEN SIXTY NINE GOT RID OF

01:14:20.689 --> 01:14:22.057
ALL THE FEES.

01:14:22.124 --> 01:14:23.559
GOT RID OF ALL THE FEES AND THE

01:14:23.625 --> 01:14:25.761
WATER DISTRICTS CAME IN AND THEY

01:14:25.828 --> 01:14:27.596
SAY WE DON'T GET THE MONEY UP

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:30.199
FRONT FROM PROP THIRTEEN WE NEED

01:14:30.265 --> 01:14:31.366
TO HAVE SOME PEACE WE TOOK AN

01:14:31.433 --> 01:14:32.167
AMENDMENT.

01:14:32.234 --> 01:14:33.702
HERE THAT SAID THAT THERE WOULD

01:14:33.769 --> 01:14:35.704
BE NO FEES BUT THE SEWER

01:14:35.771 --> 01:14:36.672
DISTRICTS WOULD BE ABLE TO GET

01:14:36.738 --> 01:14:38.941
PROPORTIONAL TO THE SIZE.

01:14:39.007 --> 01:14:40.509
BECAUSE THE THEORY WAS THAT WHEN

01:14:40.576 --> 01:14:42.477
THEY BUILT MY THREE BEDROOM TWO

01:14:42.544 --> 01:14:44.279
BATH THEY EXPECTED MOMMY AND

01:14:44.346 --> 01:14:47.149
DADDY AND JIMMY AND JACKIE TO

01:14:47.216 --> 01:14:47.749
LIVE IN THE HOUSE THERE WERE

01:14:47.816 --> 01:14:48.417
FOUR PEOPLE.

01:14:48.483 --> 01:14:49.351
NOW YOU GO THROUGH MY

01:14:49.418 --> 01:14:50.752
NEIGHBORHOOD IN YOU HAVE TO

01:14:50.819 --> 01:14:52.087
PEOPLE LIVING IN A THREE BEDROOM

01:14:52.154 --> 01:14:53.589
HOUSE SO IF YOU'RE GOING TO PUT

01:14:53.655 --> 01:14:55.490
IN ANOTHER. SIX HUNDRED SQUARE

01:14:55.557 --> 01:14:59.428
FOOT UNIT IT'S NOT HOW THAT.

01:14:59.494 --> 01:15:01.563
SEWER SYSTEM WAS DESIGNED BY

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:03.565
DOING THAT IT WAS DESIGNED.

01:15:03.632 --> 01:15:04.366
FOR MOMMY AND DADDY ENGINE IN

01:15:04.433 --> 01:15:06.335
JACQUI RIGHT SO SO IF YOU IF YOU

01:15:06.401 --> 01:15:07.469
COULD SHOW THAT THAT HAD A

01:15:07.536 --> 01:15:09.905
STRESS PROPORTIONALLY TO WHAT.

01:15:09.972 --> 01:15:11.540
WHO WAS LIVING THERE THEN THEY

01:15:11.607 --> 01:15:13.242
WOULD BE ABLE TO AND IT WAS ON

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:16.278
THEM TO SHOW IT UNFORTUNATELY?

01:15:16.345 --> 01:15:17.212
AS SOON AS THE BILL WAS SIGNED

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.347
BY THE GOVERNOR THE WATER

01:15:18.413 --> 01:15:19.815
DISTRICT SAID THAT SINCE THE

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:22.484
BILL DIDN'T NAME THEM IN THE IN

01:15:22.551 --> 01:15:24.119
THE DEBT IN THE LEGISLATION THAN

01:15:24.186 --> 01:15:26.455
THEY WERE NO LONGER.

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:28.056
CONTROLLED BY HIGH.

01:15:28.123 --> 01:15:31.660
S. B. TEN SIXTY NINE SO THAT'S

01:15:31.727 --> 01:15:32.227
WHY WE HAD TO DO THE CLEANUP

01:15:32.294 --> 01:15:33.862
LANGUAGE SO THERE WAS A HARD.

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:34.396
GOOD I TOOK A GOOD FAITH

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:37.165
AMENDMENTS. TO DEAL WITH THE

01:15:37.232 --> 01:15:39.101
WATER DISTRICTS AND THEN THEY

01:15:39.167 --> 01:15:39.735
SAID THAT WE DON'T APPLY SO NOW

01:15:39.801 --> 01:15:41.470
THEY THEY AGREE THAT THEY HAVE A

01:15:41.536 --> 01:15:43.171
PROPORTIONAL FEE SO.

01:15:43.238 --> 01:15:45.641
THE I BELIEVE THAT THE COUNTY

01:15:45.707 --> 01:15:47.142
THERE'S NO CONVERSION THERE'S NO

01:15:47.209 --> 01:15:49.177
FEE FOR CONVERSION YOU KNOW.

01:15:49.244 --> 01:15:51.079
CAN CONVERSION DISPROPORTIONAL

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.881
OR NEW THERE'S NO.

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:54.216
YOU KNOW FEE THAT YOU WE GET I

01:15:54.283 --> 01:15:55.717
THINK THE QUESTION THAT THE

01:15:55.784 --> 01:15:57.085
COUNTIES WERE SAYING ON THESE

01:15:57.152 --> 01:15:59.288
OUTLINING.

01:15:59.354 --> 01:16:00.756
AREAS THAT HAVE SET SIX THAT

01:16:00.822 --> 01:16:02.557
HAVE UP PORTIONS THE BEST FOR

01:16:02.624 --> 01:16:03.992
THE LOCAL JURISDICTION WHEN I

01:16:04.059 --> 01:16:05.994
THOUGHT THAT THE LANGUAGE IN

01:16:06.061 --> 01:16:07.896
THERE THAT SAYS YOU CAN.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:10.165
BECAUSE OF HEALTH AND SAFETY OR

01:16:10.232 --> 01:16:11.466
BECAUSE HE KNOW FIRE WHATEVER

01:16:11.533 --> 01:16:12.868
CITIES TO JURISDICTIONS CAN COME

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:16.071
IN AND SAY THESE CAN HAVE NO BAR.

01:16:16.138 --> 01:16:18.206
EIGHTY USE I HAVE IN FREMONT WE

01:16:18.273 --> 01:16:20.342
HAVE A LANDSLIDE AREA THAT IS

01:16:20.409 --> 01:16:21.877
YOU CAN SEE THE SCAR ON THE HILL

01:16:21.944 --> 01:16:22.945
AND THEN YOU SEE THE TRACK TONES

01:16:23.011 --> 01:16:23.879
THAT ARE RIGHT THERE.

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:25.480
IF THE CITY CAME IN AND SAID NOT

01:16:25.547 --> 01:16:27.316
IN THIS AREA BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW

01:16:27.382 --> 01:16:28.450
POTENTIAL EARTHQUAKES AND

01:16:28.517 --> 01:16:31.420
LANDSLIDES SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

01:16:31.486 --> 01:16:32.020
HOPING THAT THE LANGUAGE WOULD

01:16:32.087 --> 01:16:33.188
GIVE.

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:35.123
THAT FLEXIBILITY TO THEM IF THAT

01:16:35.190 --> 01:16:36.391
ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION WELL

01:16:36.458 --> 01:16:37.693
BECAUSE I HAVE A LETTER IN ALL

01:16:37.759 --> 01:16:39.494
THOSE BONTA LETTERS ON THIS

01:16:39.561 --> 01:16:41.530
PARTICULAR ONE SAYS --

01:16:41.596 --> 01:16:43.498
THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF NEW

01:16:43.565 --> 01:16:44.700
UNITS ON THE WATER AND SEWER

01:16:44.766 --> 01:16:46.735
SYSTEM COULD CREATE FINANCIAL

01:16:46.802 --> 01:16:48.036
STRAINS FOR SOME AGENCIES.

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:49.771
RESULTING IN A RATE HIKE ON

01:16:49.838 --> 01:16:51.173
EXISTING CUSTOMERS.

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.507
WHO'VE ALREADY PAY THEIR FAIR

01:16:52.574 --> 01:16:55.043
SHARE SO BASICALLY OTHER.

01:16:55.110 --> 01:16:56.111
PEOPLE WHO LIVE THERE WILL HAVE

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:58.513
TO SUBSIDIZE THE COST OF THE

01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:00.716
WATER AND SEWER HOOKUPS BECAUSE

01:17:00.782 --> 01:17:02.617
IT'S NOT DELINEATE THERE'S

01:17:02.684 --> 01:17:02.884

ARE HAVING AN IMPACT ON THE

01:17:14.262 --> 01:17:15.063
SYSTEM ALREADY.

01:17:15.130 --> 01:17:19.401
THAT THE BILL HOPES TO BRING OUT --

01:17:19.468 --> 01:17:22.104

GENERALLY YOU KNOW WHERE WE'RE

01:17:28.443 --> 01:17:30.779
SEEING THIS IMPACT IS IN THAT

01:17:30.846 --> 01:17:32.147
SUBURBAN.

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:35.317
FOOTPRINT THE FIVE THOUSAND SIX

THE WATER SYSTEM.

01:18:03.245 --> 01:18:04.679
ARE ABLE TO CHARGE AROUND THE

01:18:04.746 --> 01:18:06.148

BASICALLY A POLITICAL FOOD FIGHT.

01:50:44.270 --> 01:50:45.772
TO DIVVY THAT UP AMONG THE

01:50:45.839 --> 01:50:47.674
CITIES WITHIN THE READS AND I'M

01:50:47.741 --> 01:50:48.775
WE'RE TRYING TO PUT MORE GUARD

US TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT SOUGHT

01:50:50.510 --> 01:50:51.111
ALLOCATION.

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:56.082
IS DONE IN A MORE METHODICAL SO

01:50:56.149 --> 01:50:57.517
S. B. TWENTY EIGHT I GIVE

01:50:57.584 --> 01:50:59.252
SPECIFIC GUIDANCE OUGHT TO EACH

BACKLOG OF EXISTING HOUSING NEED

01:51:03.356 --> 01:51:04.991
BY READS AND BY IN A CRATE

01:51:05.058 --> 01:51:07.827
INTEGRATING DATA ABOUT A VACANCY

01:51:07.894 --> 01:51:09.429
RATE OVERCROWDING HOUSING COST

01:51:09.496 --> 01:51:11.264
BURDEN SO WE'RE TRYING TO DIG.

01:51:11.331 --> 01:51:12.932
OUT OF THE PAST HOLE WE CREATED.

01:51:12.999 --> 01:51:14.868
UNDER IT ARE CURRENTLY AND WE

01:51:14.934 --> 01:51:15.835
WILL BE TALKING ABOUT THIS

01:51:15.902 --> 01:51:17.470
REQUIRES --

01:51:17.537 --> 01:51:21.641
THAT COMMUNITIES ON FOR A 125%.

01:51:21.708 --> 01:51:23.343
OUT OF THEIR ALLOCATION --

01:51:23.410 --> 01:51:23.643
AND IT --

01:51:23.710 --> 01:51:25.011
REQUIRES ACCOUNTS OF THE

01:51:25.078 --> 01:51:26.513
GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS ON

01:51:26.579 --> 01:51:28.181
CONCENTRATING GROWTH AND HIGH

01:51:28.248 --> 01:51:29.949
OPPORTUNITY AREAS WITH GOOD

01:51:30.016 --> 01:51:31.051
PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION.

01:51:31.117 --> 01:51:32.419
BOSSES BILL I THINK IS A GOOD

01:51:32.485 --> 01:51:34.320
STEP FORWARD OTHER COMMITTEES

01:51:34.387 --> 01:51:37.590
ARE SUGGESTED TO OUR AMENDMENTS

01:51:37.657 --> 01:51:38.558
I ONCE ADDRESSED BOTH OF THEM

01:51:38.625 --> 01:51:39.659
AND AND WE WILL BE ACCEPTING

01:51:39.726 --> 01:51:42.295
BOTH OF THEM --

01:51:42.362 --> 01:51:43.963
ONE VERY RELUCTANTLY AND OCHSNER

01:51:44.030 --> 01:51:45.632
Y. BY WANNA ON WHICH WE WORKING

01:51:45.698 --> 01:51:47.300
WITH THE CHAIR AND I KNOW WILL

01:51:47.367 --> 01:51:48.468
CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER ON

01:51:48.535 --> 01:51:50.070
THESE ISSUES.

01:51:50.136 --> 01:51:51.871
OUGHT TO ONE OF THEM BY REMOVES

01:51:51.938 --> 01:51:53.073
AN AMENDMENT THAT WAS PLACED

01:51:53.139 --> 01:51:54.707
INTO THE BILL BY THE SENATE

01:51:54.774 --> 01:51:56.376
TRANSPORTATION HOUSING COMMITTEE.

01:51:56.443 --> 01:51:57.944
I AM AGNOSTIC ABOUT WHETHER IT

01:51:58.011 --> 01:51:59.579
STAYS AND WRITTEN STAND I JUST

01:51:59.646 --> 01:52:00.980
DON'T WANNA GET CAUGHT IN A VICE

01:52:01.047 --> 01:52:02.782
BETWEEN TWO COMMITTEES.

01:52:02.849 --> 01:52:04.150
SO WILL AGREE TO THE AMENDMENT

01:52:04.217 --> 01:52:05.085
BUT WE WAS ASKED IF THE TWO

01:52:05.151 --> 01:52:06.986
COMMITTEES COULD COMMUNICATE AND

01:52:07.053 --> 01:52:08.154
WILL HOST TO WHAT WE'RE TOLD TO

01:52:08.221 --> 01:52:12.859
DO AND APPROPRIATIONS EVEN TO

01:52:12.926 --> 01:52:14.027
KEEP IT OUT OR PUT IT BACK IN.

01:52:14.094 --> 01:52:16.362
STILL WANT TO GET IN TROUBLE --

01:52:16.429 --> 01:52:17.664
GOING TO BE ACCUSED OF ADULTERY --

01:52:17.730 --> 01:52:18.965
AND THEN THE SECOND ARE THE

01:52:19.032 --> 01:52:20.533
COMMITTEE HAS RECOMMENDED AGREE

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:21.568
I REDUCING THE RENA ZONING

01:52:21.634 --> 01:52:25.338
ALLOCATION FROM A 125% 2100%.

01:52:25.405 --> 01:52:27.340
ON ALTHOUGH --

01:52:27.407 --> 01:52:27.941
THIS ISSUE IS NOT AT THE HEART

01:52:28.007 --> 01:52:30.910
OF THE BILL RIGHT BEFORE IT'S

01:52:30.977 --> 01:52:32.779
MAKING SURE WE I'M.

01:52:32.846 --> 01:52:34.481
MORE GUARDRAILS AROUND HOW THOSE

01:52:34.547 --> 01:52:35.982
SUB ALLOCATIONS HAPPEN ON I DO

01:52:36.049 --> 01:52:37.884
JUST WANT TO KNOW THAT THE

01:52:37.951 --> 01:52:39.552
REASON WHY WE INCREASE AT ABOUT

01:52:39.619 --> 01:52:40.587
A 100%.

01:52:40.653 --> 01:52:42.122
IS TO ENSURE THAT COMMUNITIES

01:52:42.188 --> 01:52:43.923
ARE ACTUALLY HITTING A 100%

01:52:43.990 --> 01:52:45.458
BECAUSE WHEN COMMUNITY ZONE FOR

01:52:45.525 --> 01:52:47.060
EXACTLY A 100%.

01:52:47.127 --> 01:52:48.495
THERE'S ALWAYS GONNA BE REASONS

01:52:48.561 --> 01:52:49.395
WHY PRIDE.

01:52:49.462 --> 01:52:50.430
SOME PROJECTS DON'T HAVE BEEN

01:52:50.497 --> 01:52:51.898
EARLY AT THE LATE WHERE THEY'RE

01:52:51.965 --> 01:52:53.900
BUILT ON THE ZONING AND THEN IT

01:52:53.967 --> 01:52:55.535
MAKES IT ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY TO

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:57.637
COMMUNITIES.

01:52:57.704 --> 01:52:58.771
WILL HIT A 100%.

01:52:58.838 --> 01:53:00.773
WE BELIEVE A 125% WILL MAKE IT

01:53:00.840 --> 01:53:02.041
MORE LIKELY TO COMMUNITIES WILL

01:53:02.108 --> 01:53:03.209
HAVE A 100%.

01:53:03.276 --> 01:53:05.178
OUGHT IN ADDITION ARE KEEPING IT

01:53:05.245 --> 01:53:06.813
A 100% I WILL MEAN THERE ARE

01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:08.348
FEWER PARCELS AVAILABLE FOR

01:53:08.414 --> 01:53:10.283
MULTI UNIT WHICH MEANS IT'S

01:53:10.350 --> 01:53:12.018
HARDER FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING

01:53:12.085 --> 01:53:13.386
DEVELOPERS THAT'S EXACTLY THE

01:53:13.453 --> 01:53:15.388
REASON WHY WE HAVE THAT IN THERE

01:53:15.455 --> 01:53:16.289
WASN'T.

01:53:16.356 --> 01:53:17.924
AN ARBITRARY LET'S STICK IT TO

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:18.791
THE CITIES ARE THERE WITH A A

01:53:18.858 --> 01:53:21.127
REAL POLICY BASIS FOR DOING THAT

01:53:21.194 --> 01:53:22.262
ARE BUT I DO UNDERSTAND THE

01:53:22.328 --> 01:53:23.663
COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE US TO GO TO

02:19:59.324 --> 02:20:01.393
OF RELUCTANTLY HERE --

02:20:01.459 --> 02:20:03.628
TO EXPRESSED SOME CONCERNS WITH

02:20:03.695 --> 02:20:05.597
THE BILL AS IT WAS AMENDED --

02:20:05.663 --> 02:20:08.233
LAST FRIDAY SO --

02:20:08.299 --> 02:20:09.367
WITH THE AMENDMENTS LAST FRIDAY

02:20:09.434 --> 02:20:11.770
WE'RE STILL SORTING THROUGH --

02:20:11.836 --> 02:20:12.704
YOU KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO

02:20:12.771 --> 02:20:14.372
IMPACT OUR WASTE WATER AGENCIES

02:20:14.439 --> 02:20:15.273
BUT THERE.

02:20:15.340 --> 02:20:17.509
ARE A FEW SPECIFIC COMPONENTS

02:20:17.575 --> 02:20:19.544
THAT ARE PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT

02:20:19.611 --> 02:20:20.411
FOR US THOUGH.

02:20:20.478 --> 02:20:21.880
A ONE OF THOSE BEING THE NEW

02:20:21.946 --> 02:20:25.316
LANGUAGE ON PAGE SIX THAT ALLOWS --

02:20:25.383 --> 02:20:25.850
REGIONAL BOARD TO ORDER AN

02:20:25.917 --> 02:20:28.419
EXTENT.

02:20:28.486 --> 02:20:31.289
WITH ACCESS CAPACITY AND THEN

02:20:31.356 --> 02:20:33.491
GIVES THE STATE BOARD THE RIGHTS

02:20:33.558 --> 02:20:35.593
TO THAT EXCESS CAPACITY FOR FIVE

02:20:35.660 --> 02:20:36.961
YEARS WITHOUT PAYING THE

02:20:37.028 --> 02:20:38.663
CONNECTION FEES ASSOCIATED WITH

02:20:38.730 --> 02:20:40.965
THAT ADDITIONAL CAPACITY --

02:20:41.032 --> 02:20:42.066
ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE SOME

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:43.568
CONCERNS ABOUT A LOCAL AGENCIES

02:20:43.635 --> 02:20:45.804
DO DUE PROCESS RIGHTS GIVEN THE

02:20:45.870 --> 02:20:47.205
NEW AMENDMENTS I WON'T GET INTO

02:20:47.272 --> 02:20:48.773
THE DETAILS THERE --

02:20:48.840 --> 02:20:51.609
BUT THERE AT SEVERAL SPECIFIC

02:20:51.676 --> 02:20:52.243
THINGS THEY'VE BEEN OUTLINED BY

02:20:52.310 --> 02:20:54.245
SOME OF OUR A MEMBER AGENCIES

02:20:54.312 --> 02:20:55.914
THAT THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT --

02:20:55.980 --> 02:20:57.015
WE DO KNOW THAT THE POLICY

02:20:57.081 --> 02:20:59.017
HANDBOOK OUTLINED IN THE BILL

02:20:59.083 --> 02:21:00.919
SHOULD BE CLARIFIED AS TO

02:21:00.985 --> 02:21:02.754
WHETHER IT'S A BINDING

02:21:02.821 --> 02:21:05.456
REGULATORY DOCUMENT OR IF IT'S A

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:07.559
FLEXIBLE GUIDANCE DOCUMENT --

02:21:07.625 --> 02:21:08.860
AND THEN WE HAVE SOME PRACTICAL

02:21:08.927 --> 02:21:10.495
CONCERNS WITH JUST HOW THIS

02:21:10.562 --> 02:21:12.463
PROCESS WOULD WORK ON THE GROUND

02:21:12.530 --> 02:21:13.431
SO.

02:21:13.498 --> 02:21:15.800
AND IT'S IT'S UNCLEAR WHO WOULD

02:21:15.867 --> 02:21:16.801
DETERMINE THE COSTS OF

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:18.903
INTERCONNECTION --

02:21:18.970 --> 02:21:21.005
WHETHER THE FEES ARE REASONABLE --

02:21:21.072 --> 02:21:22.740
IMPORTANTLY WHAT FORM THE

02:21:22.807 --> 02:21:25.310
REGIONAL BOARDS ORDER WOULD TAKE

02:21:25.376 --> 02:21:27.779
SO IS IT AND ENFORCEMENT ORDER

02:21:27.846 --> 02:21:29.981
AGAINST THE LOCAL AGENCY AND WE

02:21:30.048 --> 02:21:31.216
DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S

02:21:31.282 --> 02:21:32.350
APPROPRIATE SINCE THE LOCAL

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:33.318
AGENCY HADN'T.

02:21:33.384 --> 02:21:36.221
HAD A WATER QUALITY VIOLATION --

02:21:36.287 --> 02:21:37.222
IT'S UNCLEAR HOW THESE ACTIONS

02:21:37.288 --> 02:21:38.790
WOULD WORK WHEN YOU'RE DEALING

02:21:38.857 --> 02:21:40.892
WITH MULTIPLE LOCAL AGENCIES SO

02:21:40.959 --> 02:21:42.560
IN SOME CASES THE CITY MIGHT OWN

02:21:42.627 --> 02:21:44.095
AND OPERATE A COLLECTION SYSTEM

02:21:44.162 --> 02:21:45.496
THAT'S THE CLOSEST.

02:21:45.563 --> 02:21:47.365
ADJACENT SYSTEM TO THIS

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:48.867
DISADVANTAGE COMMUNITY BUT

02:21:48.933 --> 02:21:50.235
THERE'S ALSO THAT SECONDARY

02:21:50.301 --> 02:21:52.503
LAYER OF A CONTROL AGENCY WHICH

02:21:52.570 --> 02:21:54.272
IS A DOWNSTREAM AGENCY THAT

02:21:54.339 --> 02:21:56.007
WOULD BE MAKING DETERMINATIONS.

02:21:56.074 --> 02:21:57.509
ABOUT TREATMENT CAPACITY

02:21:57.575 --> 02:21:59.944
CONNECTION FEES THOSE TYPES OF

02:22:00.011 --> 02:22:00.812
THINGS SO --

02:22:00.879 --> 02:22:03.848
UNDER THE PROVISION.

02:22:03.915 --> 02:22:06.117
AMENDED ON FRIDAY I'M IT'S CLEAR

02:22:06.184 --> 02:22:08.119
WHETHER THAT ORDER WOULD --

02:22:08.186 --> 02:22:10.622
APPLY TO BOTH OF THESE ENTITIES.

02:22:10.688 --> 02:22:12.490
IT'S ADDRESS SO I'M WOULD ALSO

02:22:12.557 --> 02:22:13.625
LIKE TO SEE SOME STRONGER

02:22:13.691 --> 02:22:15.693
LANGUAGE ON THE SERVICE

02:22:15.760 --> 02:22:17.295

THE SENDER STUFF ABOUT.

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:23.034
FURTHER UP IN SEVERAL MONTHS --

02:22:23.101 --> 02:22:24.369

COMMUNITIES THAT THE BILL'S

02:22:36.547 --> 02:22:37.916
TARGETING SO.

02:22:37.982 --> 02:22:40.118

FOR A SOURCE SYSTEM.

02:24:23.154 --> 02:24:25.189
IS NOT THE ISSUE WHERE WE START

02:24:25.256 --> 02:24:27.525

IN MANY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES THE

02:24:36.434 --> 02:24:36.968
COMMUNITIES THEMSELVES DO NOT

02:24:37.035 --> 02:24:39.971

AND BRING THEM TO LIFE BUT

02:25:06.164 --> 02:25:07.799

INTO THE PROCESS BUT WE BELIEVE

02:25:36.127 --> 02:25:37.295

02:30:49.507 --> 02:30:51.008
PLATE.

02:30:51.075 --> 02:30:51.709
THERE'S OVER A THOUSAND WATER

02:30:51.776 --> 02:30:53.411
DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA.

02:30:53.477 --> 02:30:54.912
AND THROUGH CONSOLIDATION OF

02:30:54.979 --> 02:30:56.680
SOME OF THOSE WATER DISTRICTS

02:30:56.747 --> 02:30:58.349
YOU ACTUALLY GET EFFICIENCIES

02:30:58.416 --> 02:31:00.384
THAT RESULT IN.

02:31:00.451 --> 02:31:01.952
BEING ABLE TO PROVIDE CLEAN

02:31:02.019 --> 02:31:03.053
WATER PEOPLE IF YOU LOOK FOR

02:31:03.120 --> 02:31:05.289
EXAMPLE THE RICHER WATER BOARDS

02:31:05.356 --> 02:31:09.894
SINCE WE PUT OUT S. B. TWELVE OR

02:31:09.960 --> 02:31:10.895
FIFTEEN OUR ARMED IN THIS HOLE

02:31:10.961 --> 02:31:12.730
IN A POSITION PROCESS I BELIEVE

02:31:12.797 --> 02:31:14.031
THE NUMBERS WERE YEAH.

02:31:14.098 --> 02:31:15.900
THE BOARD HAS ISSUED TWO HUNDRED

02:31:15.966 --> 02:31:16.801
AND THIRTY INFORMAL

02:31:16.867 --> 02:31:18.202
CONSOLIDATIONS LETTERS

02:31:18.269 --> 02:31:19.804
INDICATING STATE WATER BOARD TO

02:31:19.870 --> 02:31:21.372
TED TO INITIATE CONSOLIDATION

02:31:21.439 --> 02:31:22.606
WHICH HAVE LED.

02:31:22.673 --> 02:31:23.808
TO MORE THAN FORTY VOLUNTARY

02:31:23.874 --> 02:31:25.409
CONSOLIDATIONS NO JUST

02:31:25.476 --> 02:31:26.410
GOVERNMENT THINK YOU'LL BUT

02:31:26.477 --> 02:31:27.678
DIFFERENT MORE CREATIVELY

02:31:27.745 --> 02:31:27.978
[inaudible]

02:31:28.045 --> 02:31:29.980
THEN HELPS WE'RE TRYING TO TAKE

02:31:30.047 --> 02:31:31.348
THAT CONCEPT AND SIEU BEGIN

02:31:31.415 --> 02:31:32.483
APPLIED TO WASTE WATER IN

02:31:32.550 --> 02:31:33.818
ADDITION.

02:31:33.884 --> 02:31:35.319
TO THE CLEAN WATER SIDE BECAUSE

02:31:35.386 --> 02:31:36.687
THE ADVERSE HEALTH CONSEQUENCES

02:31:36.754 --> 02:31:37.988
IT IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED THAT

02:31:38.055 --> 02:31:39.423
SCOPE AND THE ARGUMENTS THAT

02:31:39.490 --> 02:31:41.091
WERE MADE HERE TODAY.

02:31:41.158 --> 02:31:42.226
YOU KNOW I MEAN WHAT WHAT THE

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:43.127
STATE WATER QUALITY CONTROL

02:31:43.194 --> 02:31:44.895
BOARD PUT IN WHICH I DON'T THINK

02:31:44.962 --> 02:31:46.831
WAS ACTIVELY REPRESENTED IN THE

02:31:46.897 --> 02:31:47.965
IN THE OPPOSITION IT'S AS IF THE

02:31:48.032 --> 02:31:49.934
CAPACITY BEYOND WHAT IS NEEDED

02:31:50.000 --> 02:31:51.302
FOR CALLING CONSOLIDATION.

02:31:51.368 --> 02:31:53.037
IS PROVIDED THAT THE WORDS YOU

02:31:53.103 --> 02:31:54.371
GOT TO DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN

02:31:54.438 --> 02:31:55.840
TROUBLE YOU CONSOLIDATE.

02:31:55.906 --> 02:31:57.441
AND YOU GET EXTRA WATER THE

02:31:57.508 --> 02:31:58.876
STATE ONE SIX TWO WATER

02:31:58.943 --> 02:32:00.244
PRESUMABLY TO HELP OTHER

02:32:00.311 --> 02:32:02.746
COMMUNITIES THAT ARE IN NEED

02:32:02.813 --> 02:32:04.949
VERSES WHATEVER RIGHT THAT'S THE

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:06.884
CONCEPT IN THE SAME PROBLEM WITH

02:32:06.951 --> 02:32:08.152
THE TWO EIGHTEEN IDEA FEES.

02:32:08.219 --> 02:32:10.221
WHOLE CONCEPT BEHIND THIS IS NOT

02:32:10.287 --> 02:32:12.456
TO CHARGE PEOPLE MONEY BUT TO TO

02:32:12.523 --> 02:32:13.824
BE THOUGHTFUL AND CREATIVE AND

02:32:13.891 --> 02:32:15.426
WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN THE REASON WE

02:32:15.493 --> 02:32:16.360
CHOSE TO EXTEND THIS TO WASTE

02:32:16.427 --> 02:32:17.761
WATERS BECAUSE IT'S REALLY BEEN

02:32:17.828 --> 02:32:19.997
SUCCESSFUL SO FAR LITERALLY JUST.

02:32:20.064 --> 02:32:21.866
ASKING NEIGHBORS TO TALK TO EACH

02:32:21.932 --> 02:32:23.300
OTHER NEIGHBORING DISTRICTS SO I

02:32:23.367 --> 02:32:25.035
DON'T KNOW HOW WOULD AFFECT THE

02:32:25.102 --> 02:32:26.804
ISSUE IN SANTA MONICA MOUNTAINS.

02:32:26.871 --> 02:32:29.874
CONSERVANCY I I DON'T KNOW ON

02:32:29.940 --> 02:32:32.276
AYE AYE MY SENSE IS THAT IT DOES

02:32:32.343 --> 02:32:33.511
LET ME LET ME ARE THERE I WASN'T

02:32:33.577 --> 02:32:34.144
I DON'T KNOW I WAS USING THAT AS

02:32:34.211 --> 02:32:37.348
AN EXAMPLE OF WHERE THERE --

02:32:37.414 --> 02:32:39.884
HAVE BEEN PROBLEMS NOT --

02:32:39.950 --> 02:32:41.652
SUGGESTING THAT IT NECESSARILY

02:32:41.719 --> 02:32:42.686
IS GOING TO HAVE ANY IMPACT

02:32:42.753 --> 02:32:45.823
THERE AT ALL.

02:32:45.890 --> 02:32:46.824
JUST BY WAY OF EXAMPLE OKAY GOOD

02:32:46.891 --> 02:32:48.559

REALLY SOLD ME ON THIS IS THAT

02:33:13.584 --> 02:33:15.352

THE INSPIRATION PUBLISHED OF

02:33:28.766 --> 02:33:30.301
ORIGINALLY CAME FROM THE LAUGH

02:33:30.367 --> 02:33:32.903

AND WHEN I READ THE LAW BACK

02:33:41.045 --> 02:33:42.446

02:33:42.513 --> 02:33:43.614
HUNDREDS OF THE I'D PAGE COLORS
