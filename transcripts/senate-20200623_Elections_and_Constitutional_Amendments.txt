VOTER TURNOUT IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS IS CONSISTENTLY LOWER THAT OBSERVE TURNOUT LEVELS FOR GENERAL ELECTIONS ACCORDING TO OUR SECRETARY OF STATE'S OFFICE APPROXIMATELY 50% OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS PARTICIPATED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERAL ELECTION. FOR ONLY 28% PARTICIPATED IN THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN PRIMARY. RESEARCH ALSO INDICATES THAT THE YOUTH POPULATION HAS THE LOWEST VOTER TURNOUT. OF ANY AGE DEMOGRAPHIC THE TURNOUT FOR ELIGIBLE YOUTH VOTERS WAS ONLY 28% FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN GENERAL HERE IN OUR STATE. ACA FOR WOULD CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE FIRST TIME VOTERS MANY HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS FOR EXAMPLE AND BOOST THE YOUTH VOTER TURNOUT BY ALLOWING SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO VOTE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION PROVIDED IN THIS IS AN IMPORTANT DISTINCTION THAT THEY WILL BE EIGHTEEN. BY THE TIME OF THE GENERAL ELECTION STUDY SHOWED THE VOTING IS HABIT FORMING ONCE A PERSON VOTES HERE SHE IS MORE LIKELY TO DO SO AGAIN. EARLY INVOLVEMENT IN THE ELECTORAL PROCESS FOR FIRST TIME VOTERS SHOULD BE A HIGH PRIORITY FOR THIS REASON ALONE. EIGHTY FOUR WOULD LAY THE FOUNDATION A BILL THE VOTING HAVE IT AT AN EARLY AGE ALLOWING SEVENTEEN YEAR OLDS TO PARTICIPATE IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS WOULD COMPLEMENT. THE CIVIC EDUCATION MANY RECEIVE IN HIGH SCHOOL INCREASING THE LIKELIHOOD THAT THE STUDENTS BECOME LIFELONG VOTERS. THE IDEA IS NOT A NEW ONE NEARLY HALF OF STATES IN THE U. S.

IN LOW IN OUR- THAT'S NO SURPRISE ANYONE HERE HARD DEADLINE- IN CALIFORNIA AND OF COURSE ACROSS THE U. S. ANY GIVEN ELECTION. I TURNOUT OF ELIGIBLE YOUNG PEOPLE WILL SAY. AGE EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR AND THOSE WHO ARE IT IS AN ELIGIBLE. AT TRINITY TWENTY THIRTY FORTY TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS LOWER THAN OLDER AGE GROUP. IN THE PRIMARY WE ARE BRAND NEW DATA THAT WE CAN SHARE WE DIDN'T A RECENT ANALYSIS OF THAT TWENTY TWENTY MARCH PRIMARY. TURNOUT THEIR OVERALL. FOR PRESS. FOR THE TOTAL ELECTORATE ELIGIBLE BUT FOR THOSE AGED EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY FOUR THEY'RE ELIGIBLE TURNOUT WAS ONLY SIXTEEN PERCENT. THAT BY THE WAY WITH A DECREASE OVER THE MOST RECENT FROM HER COLLECTION THAT TWENTY SIXTEEN PRIMARY. DOWN BY ABOUT A PERCENTAGE POINT. COMPARE THAT TO. THAT 34% NUMBER FOR EVERYBODY WHICH WAS A IN INCREASED BY ABOUT FOUR PERCENTAGE POINT TO EVERYBODY INCREASED BUT YOU'RE ACTUALLY DECREASED. IF WE LOOK AT TURNOUT AT THE AGE SIXTY FIVE CLASS. ELIGIBLE TURNOUT IN THE PRIMARY WITH FIFTY SIX PERCENT- AGAIN 16% PER YOUNG PEOPLE AGED FIVE. AGAIN WORKING A FORTY PERCENTAGE POINT. GAP BUT THERE ARE IN THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT RIGHT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE REAL REASON FOR THESE DISPARITIES. PATTERNS OF DISPARITIES THAT WE SEE AND THERE ARE ASKED WE CAN HATE. ADDED SHE REFUSED TO REMOVE. ASIAN AND OF COURSE- THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE HAS DONE A LOT IN THE LAST TWO YEARS TO TRY TO DO THIS FOR YOUNG PEOPLE THERE'S STILL WORK TO BE DONE- WE KNOW THAT YOUNG PEOPLE. ARE LIKELY TO SHE GOT REACHING EDUCATION MOBILIZATION ACT. CANADA BUT BECAUSE OF THIS IS MICHAEL IN TERMS OF AND THEN NOT TURNING OUT. LACK OF INFORMATION VOTERS BY DEFINITION YOUR NEW AND UNFAMILIAR AND THEREFORE UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE PROCESS OF BUILDING. LACK OF COURSE THE ROBUST CIVIC EDUCATION SYSTEM WE'VE WONDERFUL ONE HUNDRED JUST HEARD WONDERFUL TO THE TEACHERS THAT ARE OUT THERE BUT WE DON'T HAVE. A REALLY GREAT BEST. BEST ARE. AT SIX EDUCATION PROGRAM. AND THAT PERHAPS MOST OF ALL. OUR YOUNG PEOPLE OFTEN. FIND IT DIFFICULT TO CONNECT. I THE PROCESS TO WHAT THEY CARE ABOUT THEY DON'T YOU JERRY AT THE AUSTIN. IN THE ACT OF BUILDING ITSELF THE CARE VERY MUCH THAT NOT HAPPEN THANK YOU VERY MUCH ABOUT THE COMMUNITY- INSANE FORMED AND TING INVOLVED AS MUCH AS THEY CAN.

ON ANYTHING THAT WE CAN DO TO INCREASE AT TENNESSEE AND THIS IS WHERE NOW WE TURN TO THE BILL. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO INCREASE THE ONLY THING IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL. SO THINGS LIKE WE ALREADY KNOW RESEARCH HAS SHOWN US THINGS LIKE MOCK DEBATE THE MOCK ELECTION. INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD THAT YOUNG PEOPLE WILL GO TO REGISTER AND VOTE INCLUDING OF COURSE IS HABIT FORMING WE KNOW FROM. RESEARCH SO WE KNOW THAT WE GET THEM YOUNG. OTHER MUCH MORE LIKELY TO CONTINUE TO GO TO THE LIFE COURSE. SOMETHING. LIKE EIGHTEEN A FORMER. WE UNDERSTAND THAT. IT IS NOT MUCH OF A LEAP TO SAY. WELL IF WE'RE IF YOUNG PEOPLE COMING. PERSON VOTE IN THE PRIMARY AND DIRECTLY CONNECT THAT VOTE. TO IMPLEMENTING THE BALLOT ON THE GENERAL ELECTION. RIGHT THAT CAN BE QUITE SUBSTANTIAL- AND CERTAINLY CAN BE USED AS A TOOL IMMOBILIZING AND- OUTREACH EFFORTS OF YOUNG PEOPLE AS OF TO OCCUR. SO I'LL LEAVE IT THERE BUT- YOU KNOW THE RESEARCH TELLS US HERE THAT THIS COULD BE ANOTHER KEY TOOL. FOR ALL OF THOSE EFFORTS TO INCREASE AT THE ALL OF THESE ARE YOUNG PEOPLE AND- TO GET THEM TO.

THANK YOU AGAIN SIR GOOD AFTERNOON MISS CHAIR MEMBERS WE ARE TRULY EXPERIENCING UNPRECEDENTED TIMES WHILE THE KOBE PANDEMIC CONTINUES WITH NO END IN SIGHT SORT OF CALIFORNIA'S HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS AND LOOMING WILDFIRE SEASON. I AM PROUD TO PRESENT A CA ELEVEN AS A COMPROMISE MEASURE TO REPLACE THE MEASURE WHICH HAS QUALIFY FOR THE NOVEMBER BALLOT ENSURING THAT FUNDING FOR FIRE PROTECTION AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT REVENUES ARE PROTECTED ALLOWING FOR FLEXIBILITY AND REFORM IN CALIFORNIA'S PROPERTY TAX FORMULAS WHILE LEAVING THE PROTECTIONS OF PROPOSITION THIRTEEN INTACT. THIS MEASURE CONTAINS SEVERAL PROVISIONS INTENDED TO INCREASE THE STOCK OF AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND AVAILABLE HOUSING AND PROVIDE PROTECTIONS TO VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS IN THE HOUSING MARKET WELL CREATING PROTECTED FUNDING FOR UNDERFUNDED FIRE DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT THE STATE INSURING THAT COUNTIES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RECEIVE EQUAL AND EQUITABLE FUNDING THROUGH ITS PROVISIONS PROPOSITIONS FIFTY EIGHTY ONE NINETY THREE CREATED A MECHANISM FOR PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS TO TRANSFER THEIR HOME FOR THEIR CHILDREN HOMES HAVING THEIR PROPERTY TAX REASSESSED SINCE THE PASSAGE OF THOSE PROPOSITIONS THESE EXCLUSIONS HAVE BEEN ROUTINE WITH EXPLOITED BY WEALTHY INDIVIDUALS AS A TOOL FOR ANY ONE HERIDAS THIRD OR FOURTH HOME WITHOUT THAT PROPERTY. THREE SEC PCA ELEVEN WILL PROTECT THE FAMILY TRANSFERS BUT A FAMILY MEMBERS GOING TO TREAT THE NEW PROPERTY AS A PRIMARY. IT WOULD CLOSE A LOOPHOLE FOR PATIENT HOMES AND OTHER USES THAT TO NOT INCLUDE A PRIMARY RESIDENCE BY CLOSING THOSE LOOPHOLES THE STATE WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FOR FIRE PROTECTION AGENCY SERVICES OTHER CRITICAL LOCAL PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THE HOMELESS THAT PROVIDE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ARE TO HELP FUND DEVELOPERS OF AFFORD HOW PROJECTS THROUGH THE STATE. SEE A SEVEN OPEN UP TENS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW OUT FOR RENTERS FIRST TIME HOME OWNERS. BY ALLOWING THOSE THAT QUALIFY AND WOULD LIKE TO SELL THEIR HOME BUT CAN'T DO TO BEING UNABLE TO AFFORD THE PROPERTY TAXES ON A NEW HOMES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. AS A RESULT OF INCREASED DEMAND ACA ELEVEN WILL SPUR HOUSING CONSTRUCTION AT ALL INCOME LEVELS TO ACCOMMODATE THE DEMAND FOR HOUSING STATEWIDE. AC A ELEVEN CONTINUES TO PROTECT SENIORS PERSONS WITH DISABILITIES FAMILIES AND VICTIMS OF WILDFIRE BY LIMITING PROPERTY TAX INCREASES ON PRIMARY RESIDENCE RESIDENCES. ACA ELEVEN ALSO REMOVES UNFAIR LOCATION RESTRICTIONS FOR PROPOSITION SIXTY AND NINETY THUS ALLOWING THOSE THAT ARE QUALIFIED TO MOVE TO ANYWHERE IN CALIFORNIA AND RETAIN THEIR BASE YOUR VALUE. REMOVING THOSE RESTRICTIONS WILL ALLOW OUR MOST VULNERABLE RESIDENTS TO MOVE CLOSER TO FAMILY OR MEDICAL CARE TO A SENIOR RETIREMENT COMMUNITY OR OR TO REPLACE A DAMAGED HOME ANYWHERE WITHIN CALIFORNIA. AND AGAIN A CA ELEVEN PROTECTS THE CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS. TO PASS THE FAMILY HOME TO THEIR CHILDREN ENSURING THAT CAN AFFORD TO MOVE INTO THAT HOME AS PRIMARY RESIDENCE THE NEW FUNDING GENERATED BY A CA ELEVEN. WILL PLAY A ROLE IN OUR STATES ECONOMIC RECOVERY FROM THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC WITH LONG TERM REVENUE ESTIMATED TO BE OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

AND HE OPPOSES THAT MEASURE- AND WHILE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS A COMPROMISE WE'RE STILL VERY CONCERNED THAT WILL RESULT IN A LOT SAID PROPERTY TAX REVENUE FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT. AND I THINK THEY APPROACH SAYING YOU'RE BEING HOUSING AND CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA IS A BIT DISINGENUOUS WHERE YOU'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE COST OF HOUSING YOU'RE TAKING AWAY AND REDUCING THE PROPERTY TAX VALUE WE USED. TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES. LIBRARIES PARKS AND SO THE OF HOUSING IS STILL OUTRAGEOUS YEAH WE'RE REDUCE. THE AMOUNT THAT OF FUNDING THAT COMES TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES. I THINK ALSO YOU KNOW I'M A POLITICAL SCIENCE MAJOR NOT A MATH MAJOR SO THE FUNDING FORMULA THAT IS CREATED AND THEN- AND SEEN- CONFUSING I'M NOT REALLY SURE THAT IN THAT SHORT AMOUNT OF TIME THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT- I THINK WE ARE A LITTLE CONCERNED. THAT 75% OF THE REVENUE GOES TO FIRES DISTRICT OR FIRE SUPPORT AND 15% GOES TO CITIES COUNTIES AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AGAIN EITHER CONCERN OR NOT OPPOSED TO THAT MEASURE WE UNDERSTAND THAT THIS IS TRYING TO GET A MEASURE THAT IS- WORSTTALENT BUT- AGAIN AND THEY'RE BOTH VERY PROBLEMATIC FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENT AND COUNTY SPECIFICALLY THANK YOU.

FOR THE SAKE OF THE PORTABILITY PROVISIONS THIS IS A NET. TAX INCREASE PROPERTY TAX INCREASE- OF AT LEAST A BILLION DOLLARS AND WE THINK THAT IS AN APPROPRIATE AT THIS TIME AND SO WE ARE OPPOSED. THANK YOU MR KOPPEL. RIGHT ANYBOY ELSE. MISTER MODERATOR ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION.

SEE MR HERTZBERG IS MIKE IS UP WILL GO TO MISTER HERTZBERG THEIR CENTER HERTZBERG IN DECEMBER NIELSEN. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE HERE FOR TO TELL TO SING ON. MISTER CHAIRMAN HI I JUST HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS BECAUSE- I THINK THAT IS WE DEVELOP PUBLIC POLICY. WE ARE ENGAGED IN A SIGNIFICANT BALANCING ACT. OF A LOT OF COMPETING INTERESTS. AND AS I SEE THE MEASURE ASSEMBLYMEMBER MULLINS MEASURE BEFORE US TODAY. IT IS FROM MY EXPERIENCE A VERY ELEGANT SOLUTION TO SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT NEAR TERM AND LONG TERM CHALLENGES MISTER CHAIR. IN MY THINKING IS THIS. PORTABILITY HAS MYSTICAL PAUL MENTIONED AND IS THE AUTHOR MENTIONS SOMETHING IS VERY IMPORTANT. WE'VE GOT A SIGNIFICANT HOUSING CRISIS WHERE WE HAVE FOLKS WHO BOUGHT THEIR HOMES PRIOR TO NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. AND AS A CONSEQUENCE HAVE A VERY LOW TAX BASE. MANY OF THOSE HOMEOWNERS HAVE PAID OFF THEIR MORTGAGES BUT ARE AFRAID TO MOVE BECAUSE IF THEY MOVE TO ANOTHER COUNTY OR MOVE SOMEPLACE ELSE THAT THERE CAN BE IN A SITUATION WHERE. RETIRED PRIEST IS THEY MAY HAVE WATER HOMES IN NINETEEN. SEVENTY FIVE FOR EIGHTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TODAY IT'S WORTH EIGHT HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND EVEN THOUGH THEIR CURRENT PROPERTY HE HAS IS WORTH MUCH MORE THAN WHEN THEY BOUGHT IT. THERE'S A DEEP FEAR. THAT THIS ISSUE RELATING TO BUYING A NEW HOME I'VE TALKED TO MANY SENIORS WHO ARE CONCERNED. AND WHAT WE'VE DONE IN THIS MEASURE. THE AUTHOR I THINK A PRETTY ELEGANTLY. IS ALLOW FOR PEOPLE AMONG ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TO REALIZE THAT BENEFIT SECONDLY. BECAUSE OF THIS INTERGENERATIONAL ISSUE THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO ARE OLDER FOLKS THAT HAVE AT THE HOMES FOR A LONG TIME. AND WE PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR NEW YOUNG FAMILIES TO MOVE INTO NEIGHBORHOODS. AND SO THE ESTIMATE I'VE SEEN AS THIS MAY RESULT IN AS MANY AS SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND NEW HOMES. BOTH DEALING WITH THE HOUSING ISSUE FOR FAMILIES DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES THAT RETIREES HAVE THAT ARE IN THEIR HOMES AND WORRIED. DESPERATELY ABOUT FACING A LARGER TAX BILL SOLUTION NUMBER ONE. SOLUTION NUMBER TWO IN THE LARGER CITIES. WHERE ARMED. A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF THEIR COUNTIES OF THE TAX REVENUE COMES FROM PROPERTY TAX AS A RESULT OF THESE NEW SALES OF PROPERTY THAT MIGHT HAVE ONLY GOTTEN A THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR IN PROPERTY TAX HOW MIGHT TEN OR FIFTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH DRAMATICALLY HELPS PROVIDING FOR THE SOCIAL SAFETY NET IN CITIES WHERE PEOPLE ARE MORE. OUT OF. ELEGANT SOLUTION NUMBER TWO. NUMBER THREE WITH RESPECT TO FIRE FIGHTING DISTRICTS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT FIRE IN TERMS OF WHAT WE SEEN HISTORICALLY. WE ARE FACING SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES MISTER CHAIR ON CLIMATE CHANGE THE NATURE AND THE EXTENT. WHO ORDINARILY DESTRUCTIVE POWER WE'RE SEEING NOW IS RESULT OF FIRES WE NEED IS A STATE TO PRIORITIZE BOTH THE ISSUES OF DEFENSIBLE SPACE AND PREVENTION ON THE ONE HAND A YOU KNOW THAT PEACE BUT ALSO TO PROVIDE THAT LEVEL. OF SUPPORT DEALING WITH CLIMATE CHANGE ELEGANT SOLUTION NUMBER THREE. FOR FIREFIGHTERS ARE PART OF THIS LARGER COMMUNITY OF PUBLIC SAFETY DELIVERABLES WE HAVE BEEN ENGAGED A VERY SIGNIFICANT CONVERSATION RECENTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE IDEA PUBLIC SAFETY WHAT DOES IT MEAN FIREFIGHTERS A TO PARAMEDIC TEN WHAT DO THEY'RE DEALING WITH FOLKS AND DRUG THROUGH THE MENTAL HEALTH OF THE HOMELESS TO BE. ONE OF OUR FAITH WITH RESPECT TO POLICE. L. NUMBER FOUR NUMBER FIVE A LOT OF THESE FIRE DISTRICTS THAT WERE FORMED AFTER PROP THIRTEEN AND DEAL WITH THE ISSUE OF IRAQ FOR THE LIKE HAVE SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL CHALLENGES AND THIS PROVIDES THAT LEVEL OF CERTAINTY IN THE CONSTITUTION AS THE AUTHOR HAS SAID. THAT'S CRITICAL FOR CALIFORNIA ELEGANT SOLUTION NUMBER FIVE SO I STAND HERE TODAY. STRONG SUPPORT OF MR MULLINS MEASURE TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER JOINT AUTHORS. MR MAZEN A- SAID ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN AND BURKE AND I BELIEVE- BUT THE MISTER GRAY SOON TO BE ADDED I BELIEVE IS THE JOINT AUTHORS TOGETHER WITH THE OTHER SEVENTEEN CO AUTHORS OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY WHO HAVE STANDING TALL WITH RESPECT TO MAKING A CAR MAIS ON THIS ISSUE. AND THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE. IS THAT WE HAVE THIS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR DEMOCRACY DIRECT DEMOCRACY THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. THE INITIATIVE PROCESS HAS BEEN PUT INTO THE CONSTITUTION MORE THAN A HUNDRED YEARS AGO TO GIVE VOICE TO FOLKS. BUT WE A FEW YEARS AGO REINSTITUTED WHAT WAS PART OF THE CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION CALL THE INDIRECT INITIATIVE. AND THE OTHER DIRECT INITIATIVE ALLOWS THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE A HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE DAYS BEFORE THE TIME OF THE. BEFORE THE ELECTION TO ACTUALLY REACH AN AGREEMENT WITH THE PROPONENTS TO PULL OFF THE MEASURE AND SO THE IDEA BEHIND THIS WHICH IS GREAT I THINK CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS TO TAKE WHAT WITH REALTORS AND OTHERS HAVE PUT ON THAT'S ON THE BALLOT NOW AND COME UP WITH AN ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION THAT ARTICULATES AND SETS FORTH THE ELEGANT SOLUTIONS THAT I MENTIONED. IS FOR THE REASON IS A BIG DEAL THIS IS A REALLY BIG DEAL IT TAKES A LOT OF IMPORTANT BOXES AND POLICY IF CALIFORNIA VITAL IMPORTANT SERVICE TO CALIFORNIANS IN THE NORTHERN MOST NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE. AND THE MOST SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE. AND ALLOWS US IN CALIFORNIA TO LEAD THE WAY ON THE HOUSING AND FAIRNESS AND EQUITY IN PUBLIC SAFETY AND A BROAD SWATH OF ISSUES. AND THAT'S THE REASON MISTER CHAIRMAN I JUST WANTED TO. EXPRESS MY THINKING WITH RESPECT TO INSTEAD IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE JOINT AUTHORS OF THIS MEASURE I HAVE NO QUESTIONS. THANK YOU CENTER HERTZBERG CENTER NIELSEN. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT LADIES AND GENTLEMAN I RICE VERY SHARPLY IN OPPOSITION. ACTUALLY NOT POSITION. I RAN FOR THE FIRST TIME FOR THE STATE LEGISLATURE THE YEAR PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. BELIEVING IN THE AGREE JUST. RIGHT THAT IN THE POST THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA IT WAS A PROPERTY TAX REBELLION EIGHT TAX WITH BILLION. THE PRESENT CENTER NIELSEN ONE SECOND YOUR MICROPHONE. WHATEVER REASON IS NOT WORKING LET'S MAYBE I'M NOT SPEAK INTO IT HOW ABOUT THAT WE GO. VERY GOOD CENTER HEY I THEN BEGIN AGAIN. I CAME IN. ORIGINALLY THAT'S A PROFOUND SUPPORT THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. IT WAS A FRESH RATED RESPONSE OF CITIZENS FED UP WITH GOVERNMENT. TAKE IN THEIR INCOME AND THE PROPERTIES. MAKING UP MORE AND MORE OF AN ONEROUS BURDEN. FOR THEM. ELEVEN CALIFORNIA NOW THAT'S HAPPENED YET AGAIN TODAY BUT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE BEFORE. THEY ROSE UP IN THIS PROPERTY TAX REBELLION THE PROP THIRTEEN REBELLION. SHOP THE NATION. AND HAS MADE A HUGE DIFFERENCE. IN KEEPING PROPERTY. IN THE HANDS A BEAUTIFUL OWNERS. CHECK SO MUCH THE BILL THAT HERITAGE AND LEGACY. AND ALSO TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS WOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY. NOW THIS. TO HELP THOSE ERRORS. WELL YEAH IT DOES I GUESS BUT HOW MANY OF OUR CHILDREN. LIVE REALLY REALLY CLOSE TO US HOW MANY OF OUR CHILDREN WATER THAT INHABIT THAT DWELLING. THE THEIR PARENTS OR GRANDPARENTS UNCLES OR WHOEVER RECEIVED SOME PROPERTY TAX BENEFIT FROM. BECAUSE TO REAP THE BENEFITS OF THIS PLUGGING OF A LOOPHOLE. THEY MUST MOVE. WHAT ARE SOME DO NOT WANT TO THE MUSTER FOR GOOD THERE'S A CURRENCY. IN TRADING IF YOU WILL. THESE BENEFITS. I WOULD ARGUE IT'S FIXING SOMETHING THAT ISN'T BROKEN IS A TAX INCREASE. EVEN THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S TO COST IT OUT THE INITIATIVE THAT WILL BE ON THE BALLOT. EXACT ONE BILLION DOLLAR TAX INCREASE. THIS IS AKIN TO THAT. IN A LONG TERM. AND YOU KNOW WE USE SOME OF THE FAMOUS NEW WORDS OF THE DAY. UNDER UNDER. WELL STATE EVERYBODY'S WEALTHY THAT WE DON'T LIKE THAT THERE THE EVIL PEOPLE. WELL YOU KNOW. A LOT OF INDIVIDUALSWHO ARE NOT WEALTHY. CAN BE OWNING A BENEFITING AND TAX ABOUT THIRTEEN TAX BENEFIT FROM A ONE MILLION DOLLAR PROPERTY. THAT DOESN'T. MEAN THEY ARE WEALTHY. AND WE'RE THE A SCORN. THAT HAVE IN THEIR PROPERTY THE VALUE. NO. THIS IS NOT A LOCAL. THE PROVISIONS AND PROPOSITION THIRTEEN WERE INTENDED. PURPOSEFUL AN ANTICIPATORY OF THINGS THAT WOULD GO ON IN THE FUTURE. SO WE'RE GONNA TRUST THE LEGISLATURE TO FIX IT. WELL GUESS WHAT FOR DECADES. UP UNTIL NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT. THE LEGISLATURE DIDN'T DO A DOGGONE THING. EXCEPT MAKE IT WORSE. COMES PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. ALL OF A SUDDEN THE LEGISLATURE VOILA. GOT IT. COMES BEFORE US SB ONE. WHICH WAS THE ALTERNATIVE THE PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. SO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR COULD NOT THEIR BREASTS AND SAY WE FIX THE PROBLEM. THE FOLKS DIDN'T BY ACT. PROP ONE FOR A SB ONE DID NOT PREVAIL EVEN THOUGH IT WAS PASSED. AND SIGNED BY THE GOVERNOR IS OBVIOUSLY THE INITIATIVE. THE PRESIDENT. RIGHT PLEASE SHOW THE PEOPLE SAW WHAT IT WAS A RUSE. NOW I WILL ARGUE THAT THERE IS AN ELEMENT OF THAT ROUTE IN THIS PARTICULAR MEASURE. SOME BODIES I HAVE NO DOCUMENTATION EVIDENCES BUT- A LONG HISTORY OF WATCHING THESE SAYINGS. AND PROTECTOR THAT PROP THIRTEEN EXPERIENCE. THEY FEEL THEY CAN HEAD THAT INITIATIVE OFF. BY THIS PARTICULAR PIECE OF WORK. I DON'T THINK IT WILL. I THINK THE CITIZENS ARE GOING TO BE SMART ENOUGH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. EMBELLISHMENTS IN HERE- BOY WE'RE GOING TO HELP THE FIREFIGHTERS. JOHN I'M LEVEL SDOT SUPPORTER OF FIREFIGHTERS THAN THIS BUILDING OF ONE OF THE FIRST NOT JUST THAT OUR DRIVER VAN. FOR GOOD REASON I RIVER JUST NINETEEN DIFFERENT COUNTIES AND YOU CAN'T EVEN BELIEVE HOW MANY FIRES. I'VE HAD THE- BRAIN OF DEALING WITH OVER THESE DECADES YOU BET.

OF THOSE FIREFIGHTERS IN THE FIRE SAFE COUNCILS AND CLEANING UP THE FIRES IN THE FOREST AND WILD LANDS THAT ARE SOURCING. SO MANY. OF THESE. TERRIBLE DEVASTATING FIVE. YES IT MIGHT LOOK ARTFUL IN. POSITIVE THAT WE'RE HELP. THESE FAMILY. I DO NOT THINK THAT WE WILL. FOR FORTY TWO YEARS VARIOUS AND SUNDRY ENTITIES HAVE PRIDE. THE UNDERMINE. PROPOSITION THIRTEEN. AND THAT'S ALL THAT THIS IS. UNDER MY AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET MORE MONEY FOR GOVERNMENT I ASK WHOEVER MAYBE LISTENING OUT THERE. I DO NOT THINK THE MAJORITY OF YOU ARE REALLY ANXIOUS. TO GIVE MORE OF YOUR HARD EARNED DOLLARS. THE GOVERNOR. YOU EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO DELIVER FIRE AND POLICE SERVICES WELL I GUESS WERE TRYING TO UNDO ALL POLICE SERVICES NOW BUT- YOU KNOW I THINK PEOPLE UNDERSTAND. THAT THAT OUGHT TO BE A PRIORITY. ON QUESTION. AND THESE FIRES A REMINDER THIS. OF SUCH. BUT LET'S GET BACK THEN TO THE FUNDAMENTAL POINT. THIS BUT A BILLION DOLLAR TAX INCREASE FICTION I WON'T EVEN SAY PURPORTED. EYELASH LOOPHOLES. THAT FOR FORTY TWO YEARS HAVE NOT BROUGHT. GOVERNMENT TO A CHINESE. REMEMBER THE GLOOM AND DOOM MURDERS A PROP THIRTEEN THE WHOLE WORLD. AND THEN BORN AGAIN PROP THIRTEEN PEOPLE. THE DAY AFTER IT WAS AMUSING. TO WATCH.

SURVIVOR OF THE LEGISLATURE WANT TO THE CITIZENS. AND FISH THEY SUPPORTED. THE RAINY DAY FUND. AT ALL OF SOME OF THE SAME PARTIES THAT ARE. HAVING THIS IDEA HERE NOW. PULLING IN FOR IT. LOW BOY THAT WASN'T GOING TO WORK. NOT AT ALL. PROP ONE TAKING ONE AND A HALF PERCENT OFF THE TOP OF OUR BUDGET EVERY YEAR AND PUTTING IT ASIDE AND NOT SPENT SOME BAIT I.
