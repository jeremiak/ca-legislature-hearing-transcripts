00:10:45.745 --> 00:10:47.913
AND THAT YOU HAVE COVERED- I

00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:49.749
SEE THAT THERE ARE CERTAIN

00:10:49.815 --> 00:10:51.550
SECTORS THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED

00:10:51.617 --> 00:10:53.819
AND I'M WONDERING. WHY THE

00:10:53.886 --> 00:10:56.455
PROPOSAL WOULD NOT INCLUDE-

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:57.189
WHAT ARE THE SERVICE

00:10:57.256 --> 00:11:00.493
INDUSTRIES- AND THE HOSPITALITY

00:11:00.559 --> 00:11:02.395
INDUSTRY THEY'RE TWO OF THE

00:11:02.461 --> 00:11:05.231
HARDEST HIT IN THIS PANDEMIC.

00:11:05.297 --> 00:11:08.234
AND CERTAINLY- HOSPITALITY WILL

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.603
COME BACK BUT IT'S A MATTER OF

00:11:10.669 --> 00:11:14.206
WHEN- I'VE NOTICED OF THAT

00:11:14.273 --> 00:11:17.176
THERE ARE DIFFERENT WAYS. THAT

00:11:17.243 --> 00:11:20.112
FOOD SERVICE IS BEING. DONE AS

00:11:20.179 --> 00:11:22.515
A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC- BUT

00:11:22.581 --> 00:11:24.383
WE ARE STILL NVESTING IN FOOD

00:11:24.450 --> 00:11:26.352
SERVICE FOR EXAMPLE THE STATE

00:11:26.419 --> 00:11:28.888
AND COUNTIES AND I THINK CITIES

00:11:28.954 --> 00:11:32.825
ARE. MANY AT MANY LEVELS-

00:11:32.892 --> 00:11:36.662
THEY'VE BEEN REPURPOSED SO.

00:11:36.729 --> 00:11:38.297

TWO ADULTS IN THEIR AND THEIR

00:11:48.074 --> 00:11:52.278
FAMILIES- SO SOMEWHERE THOSE.

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:54.113
OF MEALS WERE PRODUCED THEY

00:11:54.180 --> 00:11:55.748
WERE MADE AND PUT TOGETHER AND

00:11:55.815 --> 00:11:56.949
THEN THEY WERE DELIVERED AND

00:11:57.016 --> 00:11:58.684
THEN THEY WERE DISTRIBUTED SO

00:11:58.751 --> 00:12:00.586
THERE'S A DIFFERENT VERSION OF

00:12:00.653 --> 00:12:03.789
HOW OUR FOOD NEEDS ARE ARE

00:12:03.856 --> 00:12:06.192
BEING MET- THE SO I'M JUST

00:12:06.258 --> 00:12:09.795
WONDERING- WHAT IS IT THAT

00:12:09.862 --> 00:12:10.896
COULD BE DONE IN THE PROPOSED

00:12:10.963 --> 00:12:13.999
MONEY- TO PARTNER WITH THESE.

00:12:14.066 --> 00:12:18.003
NEW OR RE PURPOSED OR DIFFERENT

00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:22.141

00:14:14.186 --> 00:14:15.721
HARD AND EARLY OR IN TRANSITION

00:14:15.788 --> 00:14:17.489
AND I THINK THERE. WE NEED TO

00:14:17.556 --> 00:14:24.129
REALLY FOCUS ON EXPANDING- AND

00:14:24.196 --> 00:14:24.663
INVESTING IN THOSE IN THAT

00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.898
CREATIVITY THAT MARKET CREATION-

00:14:25.965 --> 00:14:27.900
BECAUSE AS- CODES CAN AND

00:14:27.967 --> 00:14:29.401

WE HAVE TO BEPREPARED. I ALSO

00:14:38.410 --> 00:14:39.812
THINK THAN TERMS OF THE

00:14:39.878 --> 00:14:43.716

00:14:43.782 --> 00:14:46.518
AT THE PORTS- A CONVERSATION

00:14:46.585 --> 00:14:47.753
SHOULD BE HAD AT THE PORTS

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.222
ABOUT AUTOMATION AND OTHER

00:14:50.289 --> 00:14:52.558
THINGS THAT ARE IMPACTING-

00:14:52.625 --> 00:14:54.493

HOPEFULLY THEY LEAD TO OF A

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.103
REAL OF PARTNERSHIP WITH THE

00:15:04.169 --> 00:15:06.972

UTILITY SCALE SOLAR AND WIND-

00:18:39.751 --> 00:18:40.953
AND OTHER RENEWABLE SO

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.888
EFFICIENCY IN REPAIRING OVALS

ORDER TO BE ABLE TO FACILITATE

00:25:40.906 --> 00:25:42.674

00:25:42.741 --> 00:25:45.710
NOTICE THAT- IF NOT ALL OF VERY

00:25:45.777 --> 00:25:47.812
LARGE PORTION- JUST SIGNATORY-

00:25:47.879 --> 00:25:50.615
ORGANIZATIONS. SO MY CONCERN IS

00:25:50.682 --> 00:25:52.284
THAT WE ALL HAVE EVIDENCE THAT

00:25:52.350 --> 00:25:54.352
THE IMPACT ON AND THE KOBE

00:25:54.419 --> 00:25:55.420

00:26:11.069 --> 00:26:13.672
THAT. IS IT A BOARD POLICY TO

00:26:13.738 --> 00:26:15.607
ONLY WORK WITH SIGNATORY

OF THAT QUESTION IS. I WOULDN'T

00:26:19.611 --> 00:26:20.879
IF THAT'S NOT IF THAT IS NOT

00:26:20.946 --> 00:26:22.113
THE CASE WOULDN'T IT BEHOOVE

00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:23.581
THE BOARD TO WORK WITH PRIVATE

00:26:23.648 --> 00:26:25.050
INDUSTRY AS WELL THAT ARE NOT

00:26:25.116 --> 00:26:26.818

POSSIBILITY OF EVEN BEING

00:37:57.975 --> 00:38:00.144
INTERVIEWED FOR A NEW JOB SO

00:38:00.211 --> 00:38:01.746

PARTNERSHIPS AND REGIONAL

00:54:04.307 --> 00:54:06.509
TALENT DEVELOPMENT. PATHWAYS TO

00:54:06.576 --> 00:54:09.045
QUALITY JOBS. EQUITY IN INCOME

00:54:09.112 --> 00:54:10.480
ABILITY AS WE TALKED ABOUT FOR

00:54:10.547 --> 00:54:11.781
PEOPLE WHO MOST NEED GOOD JOBS

00:54:11.848 --> 00:54:12.849
HAVE BEEN MOST IMPACTED BY THIS

00:54:12.916 --> 00:54:14.551
CRISIS. AND OF COURSE ECONOMIC

00:54:14.618 --> 00:54:19.823
RECOVERY- THE SECOND REASON.

00:54:19.889 --> 00:54:20.724
FOR THE SYSTEM ALIGNMENT. IS

00:54:20.790 --> 00:54:21.958
ACHIEVE A GREATER SCALE AND

00:54:22.025 --> 00:54:23.927
IMPACT FOR CURRENT OUR CURRENT

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:26.229
INVESTMENTS. WORKFORCE PROGRAM

00:54:26.296 --> 00:54:28.832
SERVICES ARE DELIVERED LOCALLY

00:54:28.898 --> 00:54:29.666
THERE UP THERE NOT DELIVERED

00:54:29.733 --> 00:54:31.601
FROM SACRAMENTO. BEAT THEIR

00:54:31.668 --> 00:54:33.370
DELIVERED WHERE- WHERE PEOPLE

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.372
NEED SERVICES- AND THEY'RE

00:54:35.438 --> 00:54:37.374
SCATTERED ACROSS MULTIPLE

00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.376
AGENCIES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:54:39.442 --> 00:54:40.310
WITH DIFFERENT MISSIONS

00:54:40.377 --> 00:54:41.645
DIFFERENT PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS

00:54:41.711 --> 00:54:43.380
DIFFERENT SERVICE CULTURES.

00:54:43.446 --> 00:54:44.814
THAT MAKES IT REALLY DIFFICULT

00:54:44.881 --> 00:54:46.716
FOR COMPANIES AND FOR WORKERS

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:49.519
TO NAVIGATE. IT'S JUST TOO

00:54:49.586 --> 00:54:50.053
COMPLEX IS TOO MUCH OF

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.722
PATCHWORK. THAT GETS IN THE WAY

00:54:52.789 --> 00:54:55.759
OF GREATER IMPACT FROM- FROM

00:54:55.825 --> 00:54:58.161
OUR INVESTMENTS- WE DON'T THINK

00:54:58.228 --> 00:55:00.230
THE FIX CAN ONLY HAPPEN AT THE

00:55:00.296 --> 00:55:00.830
LOCAL LEVEL I SAY THAT BECAUSE

00:55:00.897 --> 00:55:04.601
WE PUSHED. OUT FOR A LONG TIME.

00:55:04.668 --> 00:55:07.003
FOR LOCAL AGENCIES TO WORK

00:55:07.070 --> 00:55:07.871
TOGETHER TO ALIGN THEIR

00:55:07.937 --> 00:55:10.306
SERVICES. AND THAT HAS TO

00:55:10.373 --> 00:55:11.307
HAPPEN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL

00:55:11.374 --> 00:55:11.908
BECAUSE AGAIN THAT'S THE POINT

00:55:11.975 --> 00:55:13.443
OF SERVICE DELIVERY. BUT WE

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.945
CREATE THE DYSFUNCTION. IN

00:55:16.012 --> 00:55:17.681
SACRAMENTO TO A LARGE EXTENT-

00:55:17.747 --> 00:55:19.082
SO WE NEED TO WALK THE TALK WE

00:55:19.149 --> 00:55:20.016
NEED TO DO THE ALIGNMENT IN

00:55:20.083 --> 00:55:22.352
SACRAMENTO. BUT THE FEDS NEED

00:55:22.419 --> 00:55:23.753
TO DO THE ALIGNMENT- SO THAT

00:55:23.820 --> 00:55:25.121
WHEN IT GETS DOWN TO LOCAL

00:55:25.188 --> 00:55:27.557
AGENCIES. THOSE SERVICES ARE

00:55:27.624 --> 00:55:28.892
BETTER ALIGNED TO PEOPLE CAN

00:55:28.958 --> 00:55:30.427
NAVIGATE THOSE AND GET ACCESS

00:55:30.493 --> 00:55:31.961
TO THE SERVICES NEED AND SO

00:55:32.028 --> 00:55:33.463
COMPANIES CAN GET ACCESS TO THE

00:55:33.530 --> 00:55:36.533
WORKERS THAT THEY NEED TO HIRE-

00:55:36.599 --> 00:55:38.068
THIS CONSOLIDATION IS A STEP. I

00:55:38.134 --> 00:55:39.903
BIG STEP TOWARD ALIGNING

00:55:39.969 --> 00:55:40.937
MULTIPLE PROGRAMS UNDER THE

00:55:41.004 --> 00:55:43.306
SAME LEADERSHIP I ENVISIONED

00:55:43.373 --> 00:55:45.241
THROUGH A SINGLE WORKFORCE.

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:51.281
THAT. ENTITY- I THINK THAT.

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:51.848
WELL I KNOW BECAUSE WE GOT A

00:55:51.915 --> 00:55:53.883
LETTER FROM BOTH LABOR BUSINESS

00:55:53.950 --> 00:55:54.684
THAT THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:55:54.751 --> 00:55:56.753
THIS PARTICULAR ASPECT OF

00:55:56.820 --> 00:55:58.288
NAVIGABILITY FOR WORKERS AND

00:55:58.354 --> 00:56:01.658
FOR COMPANIES- BUSINESSES AND-

00:56:01.725 --> 00:56:03.026
WORKER REPRESENTATIVES AROUND

00:56:03.093 --> 00:56:03.993
THE STATE HAVE HAVE BEEN

00:56:04.060 --> 00:56:06.429
FRUSTRATED BY THE DIFFICULTY OF

00:56:06.496 --> 00:56:08.698
ACCESSING SERVICES I MEAN IT'S

00:56:08.765 --> 00:56:10.266
NOT THAT THE INVESTMENT IS TOO

00:56:10.333 --> 00:56:12.435
SMALL ISSUE IT IT MAY BE- BUT

00:56:12.502 --> 00:56:13.403
IT'S JUST NOT A LINES WELL

00:56:13.470 --> 00:56:15.438
ENOUGH SO WE RECEIVE LETTERS

00:56:15.505 --> 00:56:17.173
FROM THAT CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF

00:56:17.240 --> 00:56:18.041
COMMERCE THAT CALIFORNIA

00:56:18.108 --> 00:56:19.476
MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY

00:56:19.542 --> 00:56:21.177
ASSOCIATION YOU COMMITTEE HAS-

00:56:21.244 --> 00:56:22.278
AND THE CALIFORNIA LABOR

00:56:22.345 --> 00:56:23.713
FEDERATION AND ALOT OF OTHER

00:56:23.780 --> 00:56:24.714
ENTITIES TWELVE OR THIRTEEN

00:56:24.781 --> 00:56:26.850
TOTAL- THAT SAY THEY SHOULD

00:56:26.916 --> 00:56:28.351
HAPPEN THIS DEBATE SUPPORT THIS

00:56:28.418 --> 00:56:29.819
NEW DEPARTMENT SO I THINK. WHEN

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.988
YOU HAVE LABOR- AND IN BUSINESS

00:56:32.055 --> 00:56:32.822
TOGETHER ON THE SAME PAGE OR

00:56:32.889 --> 00:56:34.190
SOMETHING OR SOMETHING

00:56:34.257 --> 00:56:36.259
CERTAINLY RIGHT GOING ON- THE

00:56:36.326 --> 00:56:37.727
WORK IS NOT DONE WITH THIS

00:56:37.794 --> 00:56:38.795
THERE STILL ARE THIRTY

00:56:38.862 --> 00:56:40.063
WORKFORCE PROGRAMS IN

00:56:40.130 --> 00:56:42.298
SACRAMENTO THEY'RE ADMINISTERED

00:56:42.365 --> 00:56:42.766
TO THIRTEEN DIFFERENT

00:56:42.832 --> 00:56:44.300
DEPARTMENTS AND SEVEN AGENCIES

00:56:44.367 --> 00:56:45.802
SO THERE'S A LOT OF ROOM FOR

00:56:45.869 --> 00:56:48.037
MISALIGNMENT AND FRAGMENTATION

00:56:48.104 --> 00:56:50.039
THAT CONSUMES PRECIOUS TIME.

00:56:50.106 --> 00:56:51.508
THAT COMPANIES DON'T HAVE AN

00:56:51.574 --> 00:56:52.809
CERTAINLY JOB SEEKERS DON'T

00:56:52.876 --> 00:56:54.210
HAVE THAT THEY DON'T HAVE TIME

00:56:54.277 --> 00:56:55.979
RESOURCES TO NAVIGATE THE

00:56:56.045 --> 00:56:57.781
COMPLEXITY OF THE PATCHWORK OF

00:56:57.847 --> 00:56:59.783
PROGRAMS AND SERVICES AT THE

00:56:59.849 --> 00:57:01.251
LOCAL LEVEL WE NEED TO FIX

00:57:01.317 --> 00:57:03.253
THAT- SO THEY SAY THIS

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:05.789
CONSOLIDATION WITHIN THE LABOR

00:57:05.855 --> 00:57:11.127
AGENCY ONLY IS. SIGNIFICANT FOR

00:57:11.194 --> 00:57:11.694
STEP IT'S GOOD GOVERNMENT.

00:57:11.761 --> 00:57:13.363

BRING UP THREE POINTS FROM THE

00:58:00.109 --> 00:58:02.645
ANALYSIS. ON THE FIRST IS THAT

00:58:02.712 --> 00:58:04.881
THE FUNCTIONS PROPOSED TO BE

00:58:04.948 --> 00:58:06.516
PERFORMED BY THE NEW DEPARTMENT

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:09.452
SEEM TO US. TO BE VERY SIMILAR

00:58:09.519 --> 00:58:10.787
TO THE COORDINATING ROLE THAT

00:58:10.854 --> 00:58:12.789
LABOR AGENCY ITSELF HAS

00:58:12.856 --> 00:58:14.824
HISTORICALLY PLAYED. INTO THE

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.960
QUESTION- ALONG THIS LINE FOR

00:58:17.026 --> 00:58:18.661
OUR OFFICES REALLY WHAT'S

00:58:18.728 --> 00:58:22.565
PREVENTING ON THESE FUNCTIONS

AND THESE PROGRAMS FROM. MORE

00:58:24.534 --> 00:58:26.135
COORDINATED. WITH A SINGLE

00:58:26.202 --> 00:58:27.770
VISION AS AS MISTER READY

ARE THE BARRIERS THEIR AGENCY

AND IN AND THE ADMINISTRATION

00:58:33.877 --> 00:58:35.612
UP TO THIS POINT HASN'T CLEARLY

00:58:35.678 --> 00:58:37.914
ARTICULATED WHY. LABOR AGENCY

00:58:37.981 --> 00:58:40.149
ISN'T ABLE TO COORDINATE THESE

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:41.584
FUNCTIONS AS IT HAPPENED THE

00:58:41.651 --> 00:58:43.553
PAST THE SECOND ISSUE THAT

00:58:43.620 --> 00:58:45.955
THERE WE RAISING THE ANALYSIS-

00:58:46.022 --> 00:58:46.856
IS IT IS IT IS NOT CLEAR OUR

00:58:46.923 --> 00:58:49.826
OFFICE WHAT SPECIFIC PROBLEM IS

00:58:49.893 --> 00:58:51.227
INTENDED TO BE SOLVED BY

00:58:51.294 --> 00:58:52.595
CREATING A NEW DEPARTMENT OF

BETTER JOBS AND HIGHER WGES-

00:58:55.064 --> 00:58:56.132
WITHOUT A CLEAR PROBLEM

00:58:56.199 --> 00:58:57.967
STATEMENT. A DIFFICULT FOR THE

THIRD ISSUE WE RAISING ANALYSIS

00:59:11.381 --> 00:59:13.116
AND ONE THAT'S MOST IMPORTANT-

00:59:13.182 --> 00:59:15.818
IN OUR REVIEW- I'VE GIVEN THE

00:59:15.885 --> 00:59:17.887
PANDEMIC IS THAT THE PROPOSED

00:59:17.954 --> 00:59:21.024
NEW DEPARTMENT OF BETTER JOBSAND HIGHER WAGES WOULD SHIFT

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:23.226
ABOUT SIXTEEN HUNDRED STAFF.

LABOR AGENCY AND AT THE EDT

00:59:40.843 --> 00:59:42.312
WOULD SPEND CONSIDERABLE FOCUS

00:59:42.378 --> 00:59:49.619
AND ATTENTION. ON WHAT IS A

00:59:49.686 --> 00:59:50.153
CHALLENGING REORGANIZATION

THINGS THAT THAT THAT MISTER

01:00:45.475 --> 01:00:46.976

REALLOCATED FROM COMPLAINTS TO.

01:35:26.320 --> 01:35:29.490

INVESTIGATE WORKER DEATHS. OKAY

01:35:33.227 --> 01:35:35.896

IN LIGHT OF COVERT NINETEEN.

01:35:37.832 --> 01:35:39.467
YOUR WORK ON YOUR DEPARTMENTS

01:35:39.533 --> 01:35:42.937
WORK IS SO CRITICAL BERMAN HAS

01:35:43.003 --> 01:35:45.172
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH. WHAT

01:35:45.239 --> 01:35:48.409
THEN HAPPENS OF WITH THOSE

01:35:48.476 --> 01:35:51.412
EMPLOYEES. WHEN THEY GO HOME

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:53.747
AND THE SPREAD THAT IT DOES TO

01:35:53.814 --> 01:35:56.217
THE TO THE FAMILY I KNOW I READ

01:35:56.283 --> 01:36:00.488
RECENTLY A STATISTIC ABOUT- IN

01:36:00.554 --> 01:36:01.722
ORDER FOR ITS JUST A LOS

01:36:01.789 --> 01:36:05.793
ANGELES BUT- OF THE- PERCENTAGE

THAT OF ANY OTHER COMMUNITY

01:36:14.535 --> 01:36:16.737
AND- SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT

01:36:16.804 --> 01:36:18.139
THEIR EXPOSURE WHEN YOU GET

01:36:18.205 --> 01:36:20.207

TO ME THERE'S A DIRECT

01:36:37.558 --> 01:36:38.726
CONNECTION BETWEEN THE

OUT THIS RESTITUTION FUND

01:42:10.557 --> 01:42:12.159
HAVING TO MOVE MORE MONEY INTO

01:42:12.226 --> 01:42:14.061
THAT FUND TO BE ABLE TO PAY

01:42:14.127 --> 01:42:17.030
THESE CLAIMS- AND I WAS PRETTY.

01:42:17.097 --> 01:42:18.999
SURPRISED BY THIS FIRST OF ALL

01:42:19.066 --> 01:42:21.768
THAT THERE ARE SO MANY CLAIMS.

01:42:21.835 --> 01:42:23.203
THAT THE RESTITUTION FUND

01:42:23.270 --> 01:42:24.838
DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO

01:42:24.905 --> 01:42:27.174
PAY THEM AND THEN SECOND THAT

01:42:27.241 --> 01:42:29.343
THESE WORKERS WERE. WAITING

01:42:29.409 --> 01:42:34.915
YEARS. TO GET- SOME PORTION OR

01:42:34.982 --> 01:42:36.783

THAT'S OWED TO THEM AND IT'S

01:42:38.552 --> 01:42:39.653
NOT LIKE THEY REACH GOING TO

01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:40.821
GET MILLIONS OF DOLLARS WE'RE

01:42:40.888 --> 01:42:41.822

MAYBE THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AT

01:42:43.891 --> 01:42:45.993
AT AT THE MOST- AND IT WAS

01:42:46.059 --> 01:42:48.095

SOMEONE HAD NOT IT'S A-

01:43:10.517 --> 01:43:12.853
UNBELIEVABLY SLOW. BUT I THINK

01:43:12.920 --> 01:43:15.355
AT THE HEART OF IT IS. THAT

01:43:15.422 --> 01:43:18.258

MONEY IN THE RESTITUTION FUND

01:43:27.134 --> 01:43:29.169

A RECOMMENDATION AS TO HOW WE-

01:43:43.350 --> 01:43:47.020
ADDRESS THIS BECAUSE- IT SEEMS

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:49.423
LIKE A CRAZY CYCLE. WITH THE

01:43:49.489 --> 01:43:52.593

INDUSTRY- AND I THINK THERE ARE

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:42.209
TWO PIECES I WOULD CAP OR

01:44:42.275 --> 01:44:44.311

CATEGORIZE WHAT WE'RE DOING. I

01:44:46.480 --> 01:44:48.582

CORRELATION TO THE BACKLOG OF

01:45:18.345 --> 01:45:20.814
THE GARMENT CLAIMS- THEN THERE
