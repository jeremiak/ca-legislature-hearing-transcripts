ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO

SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY VILLAGES

00:02:43.162 --> 00:02:44.797
AS AMENDED THOSE HERE SEVERAL

00:02:44.864 --> 00:02:45.431
TIMES REFLECT THE CHANGE IN

00:02:48.868 --> 00:02:52.872
WE'LL HEAR ABOUT IN GREATER

00:02:52.939 --> 00:02:54.707
DETAIL FROM OUR PANEL.

00:02:54.774 --> 00:02:55.308
I THINK WE CAN ALL WITH THE

00:02:55.375 --> 00:02:57.010
CURRENT LEVEL SERVICES FOR

00:02:57.076 --> 00:02:57.677
SENIORS --

00:02:57.744 --> 00:02:59.112
AS AS JUST REFERRED TO BY THE

00:02:59.178 --> 00:03:02.849
SUMMER CATALOGUE OF A IS AN

00:03:02.916 --> 00:03:03.516
INADEQUATE.

00:03:03.583 --> 00:03:06.886
AND THAT THE STATE BIRDS ARE NOT

00:03:06.953 --> 00:03:08.688
WELL DIRECTED.

00:03:08.755 --> 00:03:10.723
NOT AS WELL DIRECTOR RECORDED AS

00:03:10.790 --> 00:03:11.357
THEY COULD BE ESPECIALLY GIVEN

00:03:11.424 --> 00:03:12.759
THE THE DIVERSE GROUP OF OF

00:03:12.825 --> 00:03:14.694
LOCAL.

00:03:14.761 --> 00:03:15.361
THE FOLKS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL I

00:03:15.428 --> 00:03:16.996
THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

00:03:17.063 --> 00:03:18.865
GREATER NATION --

00:03:18.932 --> 00:03:22.902
IT IS CALIFORNIANS ACT IN A WAY

00:03:22.969 --> 00:03:24.671
THAT REFLECTS OUR CURRENT

00:03:24.737 --> 00:03:26.739
REALITIES AND THAT WE DO IT IN

00:03:26.806 --> 00:03:27.373
SUCH A WAY THAT IS FLEXIBLE

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:28.741
ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEEDS OF

00:03:28.808 --> 00:03:29.342
CALIFORNIANS ARE RAPIDLY AGING

00:03:29.409 --> 00:03:30.710
POPULATION.

00:03:30.777 --> 00:03:32.679
WHILE ENSURING THAT OUR SENIORS

00:03:32.745 --> 00:03:33.346
GET ALL THE SERVICES THAT THEY

00:03:33.413 --> 00:03:35.148
NEED AND DESERVE IT SO I THINK

00:03:35.214 --> 00:03:36.916
ABOUT THOSE ARE GOALS THAT.

00:03:36.983 --> 00:03:38.751
I THINK EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM

00:03:38.818 --> 00:03:40.820
HAS BEEN WORKING ON AND FOR MANY

00:03:40.887 --> 00:03:42.689
YEARS IN THEIR OWN WAY AND I

00:03:42.755 --> 00:03:43.356
THINK THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WE

00:03:43.423 --> 00:03:46.659
REALLY SEEN --

00:03:46.726 --> 00:03:48.728
THE THE WORK OF BOTH FROM THE

00:03:48.795 --> 00:03:50.730
STATE START WORKING WITH MY WOR-

00:03:50.797 --> 00:03:52.865
COORDINATION AT A AND BETTER

00:03:52.932 --> 00:03:55.034
STRATEGY ANOTHER AND IT'S NOT

00:03:55.101 --> 00:03:55.702
SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY BUILD

00:03:55.768 --> 00:03:56.703
UPON.

00:03:56.769 --> 00:03:57.337
AND SO --

00:03:57.403 --> 00:03:58.972
WE'RE GONNA GO AHEAD AND GET

00:03:59.038 --> 00:04:00.907

00:04:00.974 --> 00:04:01.274
GO -- IN

00:04:01.341 --> 00:04:02.742
TILL NOON --

00:04:02.809 --> 00:04:05.078
AND SO WE CAN I GET A LOT OF

00:04:05.144 --> 00:04:05.678
INFORMATION.

00:04:05.745 --> 00:04:06.913
OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO.

00:04:06.980 --> 00:04:09.148
AND SOME BRAKE SIDE ABOUT THAT

00:04:09.215 --> 00:04:13.119
AND TO START OFF THIS IS ALWAYS

00:04:13.186 --> 00:04:16.689
IMPORTANT.

00:04:16.756 --> 00:04:18.858
SPEAK ON HISTORIC OVERVIEW.

SKIN FOUNDATION OLDER

00:16:52.411 --> 00:16:54.513
CALIFORNIANS ACT IN RELATION TO

00:16:54.580 --> 00:16:56.248
OUR BROADER SERVICE DELIVERY

00:16:56.315 --> 00:16:56.915
SYSTEM.

00:16:56.982 --> 00:16:58.417
SOME OF OUR SYSTEM CHALLENGES

00:16:58.484 --> 00:17:00.419
FEDERAL STRUCTURAL ISSUES AND

00:17:00.486 --> 00:17:04.256
EMERGING POLICY CONSIDERATIONS.

00:17:04.323 --> 00:17:06.225
SO ALL STAR WITH THE CHALLENGE

00:17:06.291 --> 00:17:06.892
IT'S WIDELY KNOWN THAT MANY

00:17:06.959 --> 00:17:08.560
CALIFORNIANS STRUGGLE TO ACCESS

00:17:08.627 --> 00:17:10.562
THE SERVICES AND SUPPORTS THAT

00:17:10.629 --> 00:17:12.631
THEY NEED. TO LIVE WITH DIGNITY

00:17:12.698 --> 00:17:14.500
AND INDEPENDENCE BUT THE PROBLEM

00:17:14.566 --> 00:17:16.368
REALLY IS MULTI FACETED AS YOU

00:17:16.435 --> 00:17:18.570
BOTH ALLUDED TO IT STEMS FROM A

00:17:18.637 --> 00:17:20.239
NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING

00:17:20.305 --> 00:17:20.906
SYSTEM FRAGMENTATION.

00:17:20.973 --> 00:17:24.243
LACK OF ACCESS TO INFORMATION

00:17:24.309 --> 00:17:24.777
AND ASSISTANCE AND AN

00:17:24.843 --> 00:17:26.412
INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS

00:17:26.478 --> 00:17:28.347
ULTIMATELY UNABLE TO KEEP PACE

00:17:28.414 --> 00:17:30.282
WITH POPULATION NEAT.

00:17:30.349 --> 00:17:30.949
SO ALL IN THE MEANTIME

00:17:31.016 --> 00:17:32.584
CALIFORNIA'S OLDER POPULATION IS

00:17:32.651 --> 00:17:34.586
GROWING AS WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT

00:17:34.653 --> 00:17:36.588
ONLY GROWING IT'S BECOMING MORE

00:17:36.655 --> 00:17:38.257
UNIQUE AND DIVERSE.

00:17:38.323 --> 00:17:40.225
WHICH IS ALL THE MORE IMPORTANT

00:17:40.292 --> 00:17:40.759
THAT WE DEVELOP A SERVICE

00:17:40.826 --> 00:17:42.461
DELIVERY SYSTEM THAT

00:17:42.528 --> 00:17:44.430
STRENGTHENED TO MEET OUR

00:17:44.496 --> 00:17:46.331
POPULATION NEED NOT ONLY NOW.

00:17:46.398 --> 00:17:48.267
BUT INTO THE FUTURE.

00:17:48.333 --> 00:17:48.767
SO WHY DO WE FACE THESE

00:17:48.834 --> 00:17:50.302
CHALLENGES --

00:17:50.369 --> 00:17:52.538
WILL REALLY THE SYSTEM IS OF ALL

00:17:52.604 --> 00:17:54.406
KIND OF AS REALLY IMPORTANT

00:17:54.473 --> 00:17:56.241
PROGRAMS ALL OF WHICH LARA

00:17:56.308 --> 00:17:56.909
OUTLINED AS WELL AS MANY OTHERS

00:17:56.975 --> 00:17:58.477
IN OTHER DEPARTMENTS.

00:17:58.544 --> 00:18:00.546
ALL THESE REALLY CRITICAL

00:18:00.612 --> 00:18:02.448
PROGRAMS HAVE KIND OF INVOLVED

00:18:02.514 --> 00:18:02.981
AS THE PATCHWORK --

00:18:03.048 --> 00:18:04.550
ACROSS DEPARTMENTS WITH

00:18:04.616 --> 00:18:06.218
DIFFERENT ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA

00:18:06.285 --> 00:18:08.287
DIFFERENT FUNDING STREAMS --

00:18:08.353 --> 00:18:12.224
IN ALL OF THIS ULTIMATELY MAKES

00:18:12.291 --> 00:18:14.293
IT REALLY HARD FOR CONSUMERS TO

00:18:14.359 --> 00:18:16.295
ACCESS THE SUPER SERVICES AND

00:18:16.361 --> 00:18:16.895
SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED IN A

00:18:16.962 --> 00:18:20.265
COORDINATED.

00:18:20.332 --> 00:18:20.899
STREAMLINED FASHION.

00:18:20.966 --> 00:18:22.701
SO MORE AND MORE WHAT WE'RE

00:18:22.768 --> 00:18:24.436
SEEING IS THAT THE SYSTEM IS

00:18:24.503 --> 00:18:26.438
BEGINNING TO EVOLVE TOWARDS ONE

00:18:26.505 --> 00:18:28.340
THAT NOT ONLY LOOKS AT IN

00:18:28.407 --> 00:18:30.309
INDIVIDUALS AGE BUT IN

00:18:30.375 --> 00:18:32.311
INDIVIDUALS FUNCTIONAL CAPACITY-

00:18:32.377 --> 00:18:34.313
AS A CONDITION OF ELIGIBILITY SO

00:18:34.379 --> 00:18:36.415
BASICALLY WHAT THAT MEANS IS

00:18:36.482 --> 00:18:38.383
THAT PEOPLE OF ALL AGES WHO NEED

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:42.221
LONG TERM SERVICES AND SUPPORTS-

00:18:42.287 --> 00:18:44.223
NEED SIMILAR TYPES OF SERVICES

00:18:44.289 --> 00:18:46.391
ACROSS THE LIFESPAN NOW THIS

00:18:46.458 --> 00:18:47.059
ISN'T TO SAY THAT THERE ARE

00:18:47.125 --> 00:18:50.262
DIFFERENCES ACROSS POPULATIONS.

00:18:50.329 --> 00:18:50.863
THING UNIQUE NEEDS OF OLDER

00:18:50.929 --> 00:18:52.598
ADULTS SAY SOMEBODY WHO IS

00:18:52.664 --> 00:18:54.299
LIVING WITH ALZHEIMER'S --

00:18:54.366 --> 00:18:56.335
AT THE AGE OF EIGHTY ARE VERY

00:18:56.401 --> 00:18:58.403
UNIQUE IN COMPARISON TO SAY A

00:18:58.470 --> 00:19:00.239
WORKING PERSON WITH DISABILITY

00:19:00.305 --> 00:19:02.441
WHO'S THIRTY FIVE OR FORTY YEARS

00:19:02.508 --> 00:19:03.108
OLD.

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:06.345
BUT THE TYPES OF SERVICE CARE

00:19:06.411 --> 00:19:08.480
CARE COORDINATION DEPENDING ON

00:19:08.547 --> 00:19:10.449
THEIR SITUATION ACCESS TO

00:19:10.516 --> 00:19:12.518
TRANSPORTATION AND MOBILITY IN

00:19:12.584 --> 00:19:14.253
THE COMMUNITY.

00:19:14.319 --> 00:19:14.920
THEY ARE SIMILAR ACROSS THE

00:19:14.987 --> 00:19:18.223
LIFESPAN SO WE SEE THE UNIQUE

00:19:18.290 --> 00:19:18.891
APPROACHES WE ALSO SEE THAT

00:19:18.957 --> 00:19:20.692
THESE POPULATION POPULATIONS USE

00:19:20.759 --> 00:19:24.363
MANY OF THE SAME SERVICES ACROSS

00:19:24.429 --> 00:19:26.265
THE SYSTEM.

00:19:26.331 --> 00:19:26.832
SO WE'RE SEEING A BIT OF A

00:19:26.899 --> 00:19:28.400
PARADIGM SHIFT --

00:19:28.467 --> 00:19:30.669
THERE'S AN EVOLUTION THAT AS A

00:19:30.736 --> 00:19:32.471
SITE IS LOOKING AT FUNCTIONAL

00:19:32.538 --> 00:19:34.506
NEED AS OPPOSED TO JUST AGE AND

00:19:34.573 --> 00:19:36.308
THIS IS ROOTED THIS CHANGE IS

00:19:36.375 --> 00:19:38.243
ROOTED IN A NUMBER OF FACTORS

00:19:38.310 --> 00:19:40.279
ONE OF WHICH BEGAN WITH.

00:19:40.345 --> 00:19:40.946
THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:44.283
HOMESTEAD DECISION WHICH IN.

00:19:44.349 --> 00:19:44.950
NINETEEN NINETY NINE FOUND THAT

00:19:45.017 --> 00:19:46.552
INDIVIDUALS REGARDLESS OF AGE

00:19:46.618 --> 00:19:48.487
HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE IN THE

00:19:48.554 --> 00:19:50.389
LEAST RESTRICTIVE MOST HOME AND

00:19:50.455 --> 00:19:52.224
COMMUNITY BASED SETTING POSSIBLE

00:19:52.291 --> 00:19:54.226
ACCORDING TO THEIR NEEDS AND

00:19:54.293 --> 00:19:54.893
PREFERENCES OF COURSE NOT

00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.628
EVERYBODY CAN ALWAYS LIVE IN THE

00:19:56.695 --> 00:19:58.263
HOME AND THE COMMUNITY.

00:19:58.330 --> 00:19:58.931
BUT BASICALLY THE SUPREME COURT

00:19:58.997 --> 00:20:00.732
SAID IT'S THEIR RIGHT TO LIVE IN

00:20:00.799 --> 00:20:02.634
THE MOST INTEGRATED SETTING SO

00:20:02.701 --> 00:20:04.403
THIS JUST STARTED TO SET A

00:20:04.469 --> 00:20:06.271
STANDARD FOR LOOKING IT NEEDS.

00:20:06.338 --> 00:20:08.407
ACROSS THE LIFESPAN IN A MORE

00:20:08.473 --> 00:20:10.309
COORDINATED FASHION --

00:20:10.375 --> 00:20:12.411
AND AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE HAVE

00:20:12.477 --> 00:20:14.246
SEEN THIS SHIFT IN HOW THEY

00:20:14.313 --> 00:20:16.248
ORGANIZE PROGRAMS --

00:20:16.315 --> 00:20:16.915
IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE

00:20:16.982 --> 00:20:18.584
DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN

00:20:18.650 --> 00:20:20.285
SERVICES ESTABLISHED THE

00:20:20.352 --> 00:20:20.852
ADMINISTRATION FOR COMMUNITY

00:20:20.919 --> 00:20:22.287
LIVING --

00:20:22.354 --> 00:20:24.289
THIS BROUGHT TOGETHER THE

00:20:24.356 --> 00:20:26.291
ADMINISTRATION ON AGING WITH AS

00:20:26.358 --> 00:20:26.959
DIRECTOR CONNELLY REFERENCED

00:20:27.025 --> 00:20:28.627
OVERSEAS THE OLDER AMERICANS ACT

00:20:28.694 --> 00:20:30.596
PROGRAMS BUT IT ALSO BROUGHT

00:20:30.662 --> 00:20:32.564
TOGETHER THE FEDERAL OFFICE ON

00:20:32.631 --> 00:20:34.266
DISABILITY.

00:20:34.333 --> 00:20:34.800
AND ADMINISTRATION ON

00:20:34.866 --> 00:20:36.435
INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY

00:20:36.501 --> 00:20:38.537
INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL

00:20:38.604 --> 00:20:40.272
DISABILITIES.

00:20:40.339 --> 00:20:44.409
AND THIS ADMINISTRATION FOR GOOD

00:20:44.476 --> 00:20:46.612
POINT OF COORDINATING POLICY

00:20:46.678 --> 00:20:50.315
DEVELOPMENT FOR ALL ACROSS THE

00:20:50.382 --> 00:20:52.384
LIFESPAN WITH THE GOAL THAT ALL

00:20:52.451 --> 00:20:54.453
ARE ADULTS AND PEOPLE WITH

00:20:54.519 --> 00:20:55.053
DISABILITIES WANNA LIVE WITH

00:20:55.120 --> 00:20:56.254
DIGNITY.

00:20:56.321 --> 00:20:58.223
AND INDEPENDENCE --

00:20:58.290 --> 00:21:00.225
SO WITH THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS

00:21:00.292 --> 00:21:00.859
ACT THERE REALLY IS A GREAT

00:21:00.926 --> 00:21:02.561
OPPORTUNITY TO EXAMINE IT IN

00:21:02.628 --> 00:21:04.596
LIGHT OF OUR CHANGING SERVICE

00:21:04.663 --> 00:21:06.398
DELIVERY SYSTEM.

00:21:06.465 --> 00:21:08.300
OZ'S REFERENCED --

00:21:08.367 --> 00:21:08.934
WHEN THE OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACT

00:21:09.001 --> 00:21:12.270
WAS ESTABLISHED IN?

00:21:12.337 --> 00:21:12.938
NINETEEN EIGHTY IT'S BEEN

00:21:13.005 --> 00:21:14.239
AMENDED SEVERAL TIMES SINCE THEN

00:21:14.306 --> 00:21:16.375
ALL WITH VERY IMPORTANT CHANGES

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:18.276
AND ADDITIONS TO IT.

00:21:18.343 --> 00:21:18.977
ON BUT IT'S NOW WHEN YOU LOOK AT

00:21:19.044 --> 00:21:20.746
IT TODAY IT DOES CONTAIN SOME

00:21:20.812 --> 00:21:24.583
SECTIONS THAT COULD USE SOME

00:21:24.650 --> 00:21:26.251
UPDATING.

00:21:26.318 --> 00:21:26.918
AS WELL AS THERE'S NOT MANY

00:21:26.985 --> 00:21:28.520
PROGRAMS AND WHO THAT RECEIVE NO

00:21:28.587 --> 00:21:29.187
GENERAL FUND SUPPORT.

00:21:29.254 --> 00:21:30.656
AND MANY OF SOME HAVE NOT BEEN

00:21:30.722 --> 00:21:32.457
IMPLEMENTED TO TO LACK OF

00:21:34.326 --> 00:21:34.926
SO IF YOU STEP BACK THEN AND YOU

00:21:34.993 --> 00:21:38.230
LOOK ACROSS OUR DEPARTMENTS IF

OKAY BUT AGAIN WITH VARYING

00:21:52.544 --> 00:21:54.379
ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA AND THE

00:21:54.446 --> 00:21:56.615
CHALLENGE IS THAT THERE'S NO

00:21:56.682 --> 00:21:58.583
OVER ARCHING LEADERSHIP STRATEGY

00:21:58.650 --> 00:22:00.619
ACROSS AS DEPARTMENTS FOCUSED

00:22:00.686 --> 00:22:04.356
SOLELY ON THE GOAL OF HELPING

INDEPENDENCE AND SETTING OF

THEIR CHOICE SO WHAT WE REALLY

00:22:08.627 --> 00:22:10.362

00:35:26.557 --> 00:35:28.292
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE SYSTEM HOW

00:35:28.359 --> 00:35:28.960
CHALLENGING IT CAN BE.

00:35:29.026 --> 00:35:32.296
SO I FULLY SUPPORT THIS DUES --

00:35:32.363 --> 00:35:32.997
DESIGNATION OF ADMINISTRATION TO

00:35:33.064 --> 00:35:34.532
BE LIVING AND WHAT THAT COULD

00:35:34.599 --> 00:35:36.434
MEAN I BELIEVE ADDED BEST WOULD

00:35:36.501 --> 00:35:38.236
BE TRULY A PUBLIC PRIVATE

00:35:38.302 --> 00:35:40.304
PARTNERSHIPS SUMMER PROGRAMS ARE

00:35:40.371 --> 00:35:42.340
DELIVERED AS DRUG SERVICES THAT

00:35:42.406 --> 00:35:43.007
WORKS WELL FOR THOSE PROGRAMS.

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:44.742
BUT I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN LOOK

00:35:44.809 --> 00:35:46.344
TO THE LOCAL CALIFORNIA ELDER

00:35:46.410 --> 00:35:47.011
JUST COLLABORATIVE THEY'RE

00:35:47.078 --> 00:35:48.646
HAVING ON THE LOCAL LEVEL TO SEE

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.581
WHAT TRULY INTEGRATED AND NO

00:35:50.648 --> 00:35:52.216
WRONG DOOR APPROACHES CAN LOOK

00:35:52.283 --> 00:35:52.884
LIKE.

00:35:52.950 --> 00:35:56.587
SEAMLESS INTEGRATION OF LOCAL

00:35:56.654 --> 00:36:00.424
JUSTICE CENTER SAYS AND WE CAN

00:36:00.491 --> 00:36:01.092
LOOK TO THOSE PROCESSES TO SEE

00:36:01.158 --> 00:36:02.527
WHAT IS WORKING WELL AND TO SEE

00:36:02.593 --> 00:36:04.262
WHAT CAN BE IMPROVED.

00:36:04.328 --> 00:36:06.364
IN PREPARATION FOR THIS PANEL I

00:36:06.430 --> 00:36:06.998
REACHED OUT TO THOSE FOLKS UP

00:36:07.064 --> 00:36:08.633
LONGER MEMORIES AND I DO AND

00:36:08.699 --> 00:36:10.234
MORE EXPERIENCE AND THEY RECALL

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:10.768
TIMES IN OUR PREVIOUS

00:36:10.835 --> 00:36:12.270
ADMINISTRATIONS WAY HAD.

00:36:12.336 --> 00:36:12.937
TRIED TO ATTEND THESE KINDS OF

00:36:13.004 --> 00:36:14.672
CHANGES AND THEY WOULD MEET AND

00:36:14.739 --> 00:36:15.306
THEY WOULD THINK AND THEY WOULD

00:36:15.373 --> 00:36:16.274
BRAINSTORM.

00:36:16.340 --> 00:36:18.376
YET NOTHING CAME OF IT AND SO

00:36:18.442 --> 00:36:19.043
THEY IF WE ARE TO MAKE THIS

00:36:19.110 --> 00:36:20.678
PROMISE TO OUR LOCAL SENIORS AND

00:36:20.745 --> 00:36:22.580
COMMUNITY MEMBERS I ASK THAT

00:36:22.647 --> 00:36:24.482
THIS REALLY BE AN EFFECTIVE AN

00:36:24.549 --> 00:36:26.217
INTEGRATED PROCESS THAT WE SEEK

00:36:26.284 --> 00:36:26.884
THE INPUT.

00:36:26.951 --> 00:36:28.519
OF THE LOCAL NOT ONLY THE TRIPLE

00:36:28.586 --> 00:36:29.186
A.'S BUT THE PROGRAMS ARE

00:36:29.253 --> 00:36:30.555
PROVIDING ADULT SERVICES WE NEED

00:36:30.621 --> 00:36:32.490
TO HEAR FROM THOSE DIRECT SERVER

00:36:32.557 --> 00:36:34.225
SOCIAL WORKERS AT THE APS LEVEL

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:36.227
WE DO HEAR WHAT KIND OF DATA

00:36:36.294 --> 00:36:36.861
COLLECTION IS LOOKING FOR IN THE

00:36:36.928 --> 00:36:38.329
FUTURE -- I

00:36:38.396 --> 00:36:40.298
BELIEVE THAT IN ORDER TO

00:36:40.364 --> 00:36:40.965
ACCOMMODATE THE CHANGING NATURE

00:36:41.032 --> 00:36:42.500
OF SENIOR SERVICES WE ALSO NEED

00:36:42.567 --> 00:36:44.535
TO BE REALISTIC ABOUT THE CHANGE

00:36:44.602 --> 00:36:46.337
WORK FORCE AND WHAT THAT WILL

00:36:46.404 --> 00:36:47.004
LOOK LIKE NOT ONLY THE NEED FOR

00:36:47.071 --> 00:36:48.506
CARE GIVERS BUT THE NEEDS.

00:36:48.573 --> 00:36:50.508
OF CARE GIVERS THAT WE SIMPLY

00:36:50.575 --> 00:36:52.577
CANNOT TRAIN ADDITIONAL CNA IS

00:36:52.643 --> 00:36:54.312
NOT RUNNING A PATHWAY TO

00:36:54.378 --> 00:36:56.247
SUPPORTIVE SERVICES WHERE THEY

00:36:56.314 --> 00:36:56.914
CAN SEEK A REAL SUSTAINABLE LIFE

00:36:56.981 --> 00:36:58.549
AND ALLIED HEALTH CARE SERVICES.

00:36:58.616 --> 00:37:00.751
AND THAT IS NOT SIMPLY FOUND AN

00:37:00.818 --> 00:37:02.320
ONLINE TRADING PLATFORMS WHILE

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:04.488
THAT MAY BE PART OF IT AND I SEE

00:37:04.555 --> 00:37:05.156
THAT AS A MILLENNIUM.

00:37:05.222 --> 00:37:06.457
WE NEED SUPPORT OF SYSTEMS WHERE

00:37:06.524 --> 00:37:08.225
THAT WE ARE ABLE TO BUILD SYSTEM

00:37:08.292 --> 00:37:08.893
FOR FOLKS WHO WANT TO SERVE AND

00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.494
WORK WITH SENIORS AND SEE IT AS

00:37:10.561 --> 00:37:12.263
A VALUABLE PATHWAY.

00:37:12.330 --> 00:37:12.930
IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE'VE

00:37:12.997 --> 00:37:14.298
CREATED SOCIAL WORK SYSTEMS FOR

00:37:14.365 --> 00:37:14.899
THOSE WILLING TO WORK WITH

00:37:14.966 --> 00:37:16.567
CHILDREN AT RISK POOLS AND

00:37:16.634 --> 00:37:18.469
SITUATIONS WE NEED TO CREATE THE

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:20.237
SAME KIND OF INCENTIVES TO BE A

00:37:20.304 --> 00:37:20.905
SOCIAL WORKER.

00:37:20.972 --> 00:37:22.373
AT THE GERIATRIC LEVEL AND FOR

00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.375
THAT I THINK WE CAN LOOK TO THE

00:37:24.442 --> 00:37:25.042
FEDERAL LEVEL.

00:37:25.109 --> 00:37:26.377
BUT WE'RE ALSO CALIFORNIA AND SO

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:28.412
I WOULD ASK THAT WE TAKE WHAT IS

00:37:28.479 --> 00:37:30.247
BEST FROM THE FEDERAL MODEL WHAT

00:37:30.314 --> 00:37:30.848
IS WORKING FROM AROUND THE

00:37:30.915 --> 00:37:32.250
COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD.

00:37:32.316 --> 00:37:34.218

HIGHLIGHT.

00:46:51.408 --> 00:46:52.509
DO WE HIGHLIGHT ALL OF THEM AND

SO MANY GREAT PROGRAMS OUT THER.

00:47:00.751 --> 00:47:02.686
BUT WE STARTED THINKING ABOUT

00:47:02.753 --> 00:47:06.490
WHAT MAKES THEM CARRIERS THAT

00:47:06.557 --> 00:47:08.525
ARE IN PLACE TO STOP THEM FROM

00:47:08.592 --> 00:47:10.394
EVEN BEING BETTER.

00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.296
SO IN THAT CONVERSATION THAT LED

00:47:12.362 --> 00:47:14.331

OLDER CALIFORNIANS ACTOR WE NEED

00:47:24.308 --> 00:47:24.775

00:47:24.841 --> 00:47:26.343
AND REALLY CREATE THIS

00:47:26.410 --> 00:47:28.312
CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY LIVING AT

00:47:28.378 --> 00:47:30.247
AND I THINK THROUGH MULTIPLE

00:47:30.314 --> 00:47:32.249
DISCUSSIONS BOTH IN SMALL

00:47:32.316 --> 00:47:34.218

00:47:34.284 --> 00:47:34.818
ARRIVED BUT THE CONCEPT PAPER

00:47:34.885 --> 00:47:36.486
ALL WORKING ON RIGHT NOW.

00:47:36.553 --> 00:47:38.488
SO WHATEVER GOALS WITH THAT

00:47:38.555 --> 00:47:40.424
CONCEPT PAPERS TO GET IT OUT AND

00:47:40.490 --> 00:47:41.091
I KNOW THAT MOST OF YOU HAVEN'T

00:47:44.294 --> 00:47:46.330
RELEASED BUT PART OF MAKING THIS

00:47:46.396 --> 00:47:46.930
HAPPEN IS WE'RE GOING TO NEED

00:47:46.997 --> 00:47:48.265

00:47:48.332 --> 00:47:50.467
ABOUT THE CONCEPT PAPER THAT'S

00:47:50.534 --> 00:47:52.402
THERE AND VICTORIA HAVE BEEN

00:47:52.469 --> 00:47:54.438
TALKING ABOUT TO SEE WHAT PARTS

00:47:54.504 --> 00:47:56.340

00:47:57.040 --> 00:47:58.408
WHERE THE PROBLEMS WERE THE

00:47:58.475 --> 00:48:00.277
CHALLENGES ON THIS.

00:48:00.344 --> 00:48:02.246
WE DON'T WANT SOMETHING THAT YOU

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:04.314

FORWARD AS A GROUP.

00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:14.224
AND I THINK EVERYBODY IN THIS

00:48:14.291 --> 00:48:16.260
ROOM WITH THE KNOWLEDGE THAT.

00:48:16.326 --> 00:48:18.228

00:48:29.439 --> 00:48:30.474
I'M REALLY ASKING EVERYBODY IN

00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:34.278
THIS ROOM TO EMBRACE THE CONCEP.

00:48:34.344 --> 00:48:36.647
RIGHT TO THE HEART ABOUT THE

00:48:36.713 --> 00:48:38.482
CONCEPT TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE

00:48:38.548 --> 00:48:40.284
MAKE IT WORK AND EFFECTIVE TO

00:48:40.350 --> 00:48:42.286

EXCITED ABOUT.

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:49.026
AND I THINK EXCITEMENT IS WHAT I

00:48:49.092 --> 00:48:52.429
THINK ABOUT MOST WHEN I HAVE

00:48:52.496 --> 00:48:53.096

00:48:53.163 --> 00:48:54.464
IT'S IS TREMENDOUSLY EXCITING TO

00:48:54.531 --> 00:48:56.733
HAVE A COMMITTEE IN IT COMMITTEE

00:48:56.800 --> 00:48:58.335
CHAIR THAT'S EMBRACING THIS

00:48:58.402 --> 00:49:00.437
CONCEPT AND LEADING IT I MEAN IT

00:49:00.504 --> 00:49:02.339
HAS BEEN SO MANY YEARS SINCE

00:49:02.406 --> 00:49:02.873
WE'VE HAD THIS KIND OF

00:49:02.939 --> 00:49:03.540
LEADERSHIP.

00:49:03.607 --> 00:49:04.741
AND THIS POTENTIAL SO IT'S JUST

00:49:04.808 --> 00:49:08.512
WITH THE GRAY FULL OF PEOPLE

00:49:08.578 --> 00:49:10.247
TALKING ABOUT THIS DISCUSSION

ASSEMBLY COMMITTEE IS SUPPORTIV-

00:49:14.351 --> 00:49:16.219
I IT IT REALLY DOESN'T GET ANY

00:49:16.286 --> 00:49:18.322
BETTER AND THIS IS TRULY I THINK

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:18.989
ONE OF THE GREATEST THINGS WE'VE

00:49:19.056 --> 00:49:20.257

00:49:20.324 --> 00:49:22.292
ON AND JUST TAKE YOUR TIME TO

00:49:22.359 --> 00:49:24.227
WRAP UP I I THINK --

00:49:24.294 --> 00:49:26.229
THE CONCEPT YOU KNOW A COUPLE

00:49:26.296 --> 00:49:26.863
PEOPLE THAT HAVE EXPRESSED

00:49:26.930 --> 00:49:28.598
CONCERN ABOUT WHERE THEY ARE

00:49:28.665 --> 00:49:30.534
GOING TO BE PLACED IN THIS

00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:32.269
STRUCTURE.

00:49:32.336 --> 00:49:32.936
AND I THINK ALL OF US HAVE THAT

00:49:33.003 --> 00:49:34.638
CONCERN AND NONE OF US REALLY

00:49:34.705 --> 00:49:36.540

00:49:36.606 --> 00:49:37.207
LIKE TO DO IS I'D LIKE TO

00:49:37.274 --> 00:49:38.642
ACTUALLY STEAL A SPORTS ANALOGY

00:49:38.709 --> 00:49:40.277

00:49:40.344 --> 00:49:42.312
GOLDEN STATE WARRIORS FANS OUT

00:49:42.379 --> 00:49:44.247
THERE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:49:44.314 --> 00:49:44.881
THEY TALK ABOUT IS STRENGTH IN

00:49:44.948 --> 00:49:46.249
NUMBERS.

00:49:46.316 --> 00:49:48.218
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE HAVE

00:49:48.285 --> 00:49:48.885
IN THIS ROOM YOU KNOW WE HAVE

00:49:48.952 --> 00:49:50.420
STRENGTH IN NUMBERS AND THEN IF

00:49:50.487 --> 00:49:52.456
WE COME TOGETHER OUR STRENGTH

00:49:52.522 --> 00:49:54.458
AND OUR NUMBERS ARE SO MUCH

00:49:54.524 --> 00:49:56.560
GREATER THAN ANY OF US WORK IN

00:49:56.626 --> 00:49:58.362

EVEN IF WE HAVE SOME WINS IN

00:50:00.364 --> 00:50:02.399
THOSE INDIVIDUAL SILOS THEY TEND

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.401
TO BE ISOLATED AND THE DON'T

01:21:55.443 --> 01:21:57.312
SENIORS BECAUSE THEY ARE STILL

01:21:57.379 --> 01:21:57.979
DEALING WITH ISSUES THAT FOLKS

01:21:58.046 --> 01:21:59.581

THAT.

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:23.605
