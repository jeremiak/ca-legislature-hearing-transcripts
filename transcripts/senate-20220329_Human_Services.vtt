WHAT WE PERHAPS DIDN'T PAY AS

00:03:58.137 --> 00:04:00.406
MUCH ATTENTION TO IS HOW MANY

00:04:00.473 --> 00:04:03.543
CHILDREN LOS A PARENT

MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND FORTY

00:04:10.183 --> 00:04:12.051
THOUSAND CHILDREN LOST A PARENT

00:04:12.118 --> 00:04:14.253

00:04:17.523 --> 00:04:19.459
SEVEN THOUSAND CHILDREN IN

CALIFORNIA LOST APPEARED FOR

00:04:21.427 --> 00:04:23.963
PRIMARY CARE GIVER SOUTH OF

IT THE OTHER UNFORTUNATE THING

00:04:26.532 --> 00:04:28.401
IS WELL ANY OF US NEVER ONE OF

00:04:28.468 --> 00:04:30.236
US COULD HAVE GOTTEN COBIT YOU

00:04:30.303 --> 00:04:32.372
ARE MORE LIKELY TO GET CODED

00:04:33.206 --> 00:04:34.407
IF YOU WERE LOW INCOME FOR

00:04:34.474 --> 00:04:36.209
A LOW WAGE WORKER AND THERE

00:04:36.275 --> 00:04:37.810
ARE MANY FACTORS THAT CAUSED

00:04:37.877 --> 00:04:39.846
THAT NOT THE LEAST OF WHICH

00:04:39.912 --> 00:04:41.347
IS THAT WHILE SOME OF US WERE

00:04:41.414 --> 00:04:43.383
ABLE TO WORK FROM HOME OR BE

00:04:43.449 --> 00:04:44.651
ABLE TO STAY AT HOME FATHERS

00:04:44.717 --> 00:04:46.886
HAD TO GO TO WORK AND HAD LESS

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.355
PROTECTION FROM THE VIRUS SO

00:04:49.422 --> 00:04:50.890
THE WE DON'T HAVE THE EXACT

00:04:50.957 --> 00:04:53.626
NUMBERS BUT A LARGE SENSE

00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.361
OF THOSE TWENTY SEVEN THOUSAND

00:04:55.428 --> 00:04:57.463
CHILDREN WHO LOST A PARENT

00:04:57.530 --> 00:04:59.065
OR PRIMARY CARE TAKER OR BOTH

00:04:59.132 --> 00:05:01.267
PARENTS WERE FROM LOW INCOME

00:05:01.334 --> 00:05:03.903
FAMILIES SO WHAT THIS BILL

00:05:03.970 --> 00:05:06.172
DOES IS CREATE A HOPE SAVINGS

00:05:06.239 --> 00:05:08.174
ACCOUNT FOR THOSE CHILDREN

00:05:08.975 --> 00:05:11.210
COOL ALREADY WERE IN LOW INCOME

00:05:11.411 --> 00:05:12.912
FAMILIES AND WHO NOW FACE

00:05:12.979 --> 00:05:14.781
FURTHER ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY

00:05:15.314 --> 00:05:17.250
IN ADDITION TO CALIFORNIA

00:05:17.316 --> 00:05:18.951
CHILDREN WHO WERE IN LONG TERM

00:05:19.018 --> 00:05:20.720
FOSTER CARE AND THE REASON THAT

00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:22.655
WE'VE ADDED THE KIDS IN LONG

00:05:22.722 --> 00:05:24.223
TERM FOSTER CARE IS BECAUSE

00:05:24.524 --> 00:05:26.426
ESSENTIALLY THEY ALSO DO NOT

00:05:26.492 --> 00:05:28.995
HAVE PARENTS TO RELY ON BEYOND

00:05:29.195 --> 00:05:30.129
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH

00:05:30.196 --> 00:05:32.131
THESE HOPE ACCOUNTS IS CREATE

00:05:32.532 --> 00:05:34.500
THAT SAID THAT THERE SOMEONE'S

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:36.169
GOING TO HAVE YOUR BACK ONCE

00:05:36.235 --> 00:05:38.271

SAY WELL WHY JUST WHEN YOU

00:05:42.208 --> 00:05:43.943
TURN EIGHTEEN WELL FOR MANY OF

00:05:44.010 --> 00:05:45.812
THE CHILDREN WHO LOST A PARENT

00:05:46.245 --> 00:05:48.681
TO COVE IT IF THEIR PARENT

00:05:48.748 --> 00:05:51.384
PARTY WAS IN A WORK SITUATION

00:05:51.651 --> 00:05:53.052
THAT CONTRIBUTED TO SOCIAL

00:05:53.119 --> 00:05:55.121
SECURITY THEN THE CHILDREN GET

00:05:55.188 --> 00:05:57.824
A DEATH BENEFIT IN AFFECTED

00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:00.359
SURVIVOR BENEFIT BOND AND

00:06:00.426 --> 00:06:02.695
SO THEY DO HAVE SOME INCOME

00:06:03.396 --> 00:06:04.764
TELL THEIR EIGHTEEN IT'S

00:06:04.831 --> 00:06:07.066
AFTER EIGHTEEN THAT THERE THEN

00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.669
POTENTIALLY LEFT NOW THE OTHER

00:06:09.736 --> 00:06:11.170
THING THAT THE BILL DOES IS

00:06:11.237 --> 00:06:13.239
RECOGNIZES THAT SOME NUMBER OF

00:06:13.306 --> 00:06:15.007
THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN WHO LOST

00:06:15.074 --> 00:06:17.110
THEIR PARENTS TO COATED DID NOT

00:06:17.176 --> 00:06:19.245

THE FEDERAL SURVIVOR BENEFITS

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:22.448
EITHER BECAUSE THEY WERE THE

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.250
PARENT WAS TOO YOUNG IT DIDN'T

00:06:24.317 --> 00:06:25.518
HAVE ENOUGH QUARTERS OF WORK TO

00:06:25.585 --> 00:06:27.320
QUALIFY WHERE THEY WORKED IN A

00:06:27.386 --> 00:06:29.322
JOB THAT DIDN'T QUALIFY FOR THE

00:06:29.388 --> 00:06:31.390

THIS BILL ACTUALLY DID HAVE A

00:23:50.662 --> 00:23:52.297
COUPLE OF BRIEF QUESTIONS SO

00:23:52.531 --> 00:23:53.999
FIRST QUESTION IS IS THAT --

00:23:54.065 --> 00:23:56.168
IN TERMS OF PEOPLE QUALIFY THE

00:23:56.234 --> 00:23:58.436
DEAL DO YOU KNOW IF -- IF THE

00:23:58.503 --> 00:23:59.638
PARENTS FOR EXAMPLE WERE GIG

00:23:59.704 --> 00:24:01.673
WORKERS BUT THEY HAVE THEM

00:24:01.740 --> 00:24:03.542
BUT THEY HAVE HAD -- EST ARE

00:24:03.608 --> 00:24:05.043
NOT BECAUSE WITH THOSE THEIR

00:24:05.110 --> 00:24:06.344
CHILDREN THEREFORE ALSO BE

00:24:06.411 --> 00:24:07.979
ANOTHER GROUP TO PERHAPS WOULD

00:24:08.046 --> 00:24:09.481
MISS OUT ON THE FEDERAL PROGRAM

00:24:09.981 --> 00:24:11.917
-- IT DEPENDS SOME GIG WORKERS

00:24:11.983 --> 00:24:13.451
WOULD NOT WOULD HAVE MISSED OUT

00:24:13.518 --> 00:24:15.187
SOME NOT IT DEPENDS AND IF THEY

00:24:15.253 --> 00:24:17.255
HAD WERE SET UP TO BE PAYING

00:24:17.322 --> 00:24:20.225
INTO THE -- THAT FRONT OKAY

00:24:20.292 --> 00:24:21.726
SO THE WORDS THEN AGAIN THAT

00:24:21.793 --> 00:24:22.961
THEIR CHILDREN WOULD NOT AND

00:24:23.028 --> 00:24:24.963
OF COURSE IT MAY BE A HIGH

00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:26.364
RISK SITUATION AND THEN THE

00:24:26.431 --> 00:24:28.099
SECOND QUESTION I HAVE -- OTHER

00:24:28.166 --> 00:24:29.067
YOU MAY END UP TO ANSWERING

00:24:29.134 --> 00:24:31.369
IT FINANCES THAT SO THE FUNDS

00:24:31.436 --> 00:24:32.404
THAT WERE WOULD YOU PUT IN

00:24:32.470 --> 00:24:34.105
THESE ACCOUNTS -- WOULD THEY BE

00:24:34.172 --> 00:24:36.274
INVESTED BY THE STATE WHO WHO

00:24:36.341 --> 00:24:37.943
WOULD MANAGE THE FUNDS UNTIL

00:24:38.009 --> 00:24:40.011
THE UNTIL THE CHILD BECOMES

00:24:40.078 --> 00:24:42.647
EIGHTEEN RIGHT SO AND WE'RE

00:24:42.714 --> 00:24:44.916
WE ALL THOSE ARE TO BE PART

00:24:44.983 --> 00:24:46.218
OF THE NEGOTIATIONS THAT --

00:24:46.284 --> 00:24:47.853
LET'S JUST SAY IF IT'S WITH THE

00:24:47.919 --> 00:24:49.621
TREASURER'S OFFICE FOR EXAMPLE

00:24:50.021 --> 00:24:52.224
WE WOULD HOPE THAT THEY WOULD BE

00:24:52.290 --> 00:24:53.959
-- PUT IN SOME KIND OF ACCOUNT

00:24:54.025 --> 00:24:56.261
THAT WOULD BE ABLE TO GAIN VALUE

00:24:56.761 --> 00:24:58.597
-- SO THAT THAT'S WHY THERE'S A

00:24:58.663 --> 00:25:01.066
DIFFERENTIATION BETWEEN AT THE

00:25:01.132 --> 00:25:02.067
DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE

00:25:02.133 --> 00:25:03.568
POSITIVE DEPENDING ON THE AGE

00:25:03.635 --> 00:25:05.136
SO IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE OLDER

00:25:05.403 --> 00:25:06.404
THERE'D NEED TO BE A LITTLE

00:25:06.471 --> 00:25:08.073
MORE MONEY PUT IN RIGHT NOW

00:25:08.406 --> 00:25:09.941
AGAIN ASSUMING THIS RIGHT NOW

00:25:10.375 --> 00:25:12.410
-- BECAUSE IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE

00:25:12.477 --> 00:25:13.979
TO GAIN AS MUCH IN VALUE AND IF

00:25:14.045 --> 00:25:15.046
YOU'RE YOUNGER THAN WOULD HAVE

00:25:15.113 --> 00:25:16.882
A LONGER TIME NOW OBVIOUSLY

00:25:16.948 --> 00:25:18.383
EVEN THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS WILL

00:25:18.450 --> 00:25:20.886
END UP BEING NEGOTIATED BECAUSE

00:25:20.952 --> 00:25:22.988
-- YOU KNOW IF THAT IS A

00:25:23.054 --> 00:25:25.223
BUDGETARY ISSUE AND IF YOU

00:25:25.290 --> 00:25:26.324
KNOW WHETHER IT'S AN APPROACH

00:25:26.391 --> 00:25:28.393
OR WHETHER IT'S LATER -- BUT

00:25:28.460 --> 00:25:30.528
WE'VE PUT IN WE'VE BOTH PUT

00:25:30.595 --> 00:25:32.464
IN A SUGGESTED AMOUNT THAT ONE

00:25:32.530 --> 00:25:33.798
WOULD WANT TO HAVE DEPOSITED

00:25:33.865 --> 00:25:35.200

THOUGHT THE INCOME THRESHOLD

00:25:36.701 --> 00:25:38.670
SO THIS WHAT ARE YOU DIDN'T

00:25:38.737 --> 00:25:40.739
-- I MAY NOT HAVE SPECIFIED IS

00:25:40.805 --> 00:25:43.742
THAT IF I IF IT'S A HIGH INCOME

00:25:44.042 --> 00:25:45.911

THE PAIN OF SEEING HIM THIS WAY

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.537
WAS BEYOND ANYTHING I THOUGHT

01:12:21.603 --> 01:12:24.139
POSSIBLE TO INDOOR AFTER TWO

01:12:24.206 --> 01:12:25.674

01:12:25.741 --> 01:12:27.376
BEGAN TO OPEN BUT THEY WERE

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.578
UNRESPONSIVE THE DOCTORS TRIED

01:12:29.645 --> 01:12:31.213
BIGGER THERAPY BECAUSE NO WHERE

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:33.248
FOR TWO MORE MONTHS I WAS TOLD

01:12:33.315 --> 01:12:35.217

01:12:35.284 --> 01:12:36.852
VISITED SEVERAL NURSING HOMES

01:12:37.186 --> 01:12:39.321
ONE STILL HAUNTS ME THE ENTIRE

01:12:39.388 --> 01:12:41.390
TIME I WAS VERY YOUNG MAN AND

01:12:41.457 --> 01:12:42.558
ONE OF THE ROOMS WERE SHOUTING

01:12:42.624 --> 01:12:44.193
LOUDLY AND CRUNCHING GROUSES

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:45.527
EFFECTIVELY TRYING TO GET

01:12:45.594 --> 01:12:47.463
SOMEONE'S ATTENTION I LOOK IN

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:48.797

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.666

QUIETLY TO ME AS IT IS CRUNCH

01:12:54.369 --> 01:12:56.472
FOR WORDS I LISTENED AND NODDED

01:12:56.538 --> 01:12:58.440
AS IF I UNDERSTOOD AND HE SEEMED

01:12:58.507 --> 01:13:00.142
SO GRATEFUL JUST TO HAVE SOMEONE

01:13:00.209 --> 01:13:02.010
THERE WITH HIM WHEN I LEFT I

01:13:02.077 --> 01:13:03.412
