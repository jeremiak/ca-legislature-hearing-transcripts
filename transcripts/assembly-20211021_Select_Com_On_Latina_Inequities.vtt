THE SPOT I SHOULD. PROBABLY

01:02:57.573 --> 01:02:58.541
WARN SHOULD ASK THIS QUESTION

01:02:58.608 --> 01:03:00.576
BUT SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT

01:03:00.643 --> 01:03:02.512
LEADING A PAY GAP THERE ARE THE

01:03:02.578 --> 01:03:04.714
TRADITIONAL- THOUGHTS IF YOU'RE

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.282
IN THE SAME JOB AND YOU MAKE IT

01:03:06.349 --> 01:03:07.550
DIFFERENT AMOUNT LIKE YOU WERE

01:03:07.617 --> 01:03:09.418
YOU WERE DESCRIBING. ALSO WHAT

01:03:09.485 --> 01:03:11.454
I LEAN WITH DESCRIBING- HAVING

01:03:11.521 --> 01:03:12.688
THE SAME RESPONSIBILITIES THE

01:03:12.755 --> 01:03:14.724
SAME BACKGROUND AND YET YOU'RE

01:03:14.790 --> 01:03:15.291
MAKING LESS THAN YOUR WHITE

01:03:15.358 --> 01:03:17.293
MALE COUNTERPART. BUT WE HAVE

01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:19.262
ADDITIONAL ISSUES THAT I

01:03:19.328 --> 01:03:20.630
HOPEFULLY I'M NOT CATCHING UP

01:03:20.696 --> 01:03:21.898
GARDEN IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE

01:03:21.964 --> 01:03:24.066
ANSWERS OKAY TOO BUT- WE HAVE.

01:03:24.133 --> 01:03:25.501
WE HAVE THAT'S THE TRADITIONAL

01:03:25.568 --> 01:03:27.403
PAY GAP YOU'RE IN THE SAME JOB

01:03:27.470 --> 01:03:29.071
IN NOT MAKING THE SAME EASY TO

01:03:29.138 --> 01:03:30.640
PROVE IN COURT BUT WE HAVE A

01:03:30.706 --> 01:03:32.675
COMPOUNDED PROBLEM WITH- JOBS

01:03:32.742 --> 01:03:34.310
THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY WOMEN

01:03:34.377 --> 01:03:36.379
HELP LET ME KNOW HEALTH. AND I

01:03:36.445 --> 01:03:38.381
WOULD THINK IN FACT IN HOTELS

01:03:38.447 --> 01:03:40.950
FROM AT LEAST PAST EXPERIENCES-

01:03:41.017 --> 01:03:42.451
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FOR

01:03:42.518 --> 01:03:44.787
EXAMPLE A HOTEL HOUSEKEEPER IN

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:46.622
A BILL MA'AM RIGHT WELL BILL

01:03:46.689 --> 01:03:49.625
PERSON BUT SO OFTEN MEN HOTEL

01:03:49.692 --> 01:03:51.227
HOUSEKEEPERS TEND TO BE LEVINE

01:03:51.294 --> 01:03:53.829
AS- OVERWHELMINGLY ARE WOMEN

01:03:53.896 --> 01:03:56.465
WHO ARE- IMMIGRANTS AND THEN. A

01:03:56.532 --> 01:04:00.970
LOT OF THE- BILL BOYS. ARE

01:04:01.037 --> 01:04:02.171
WHITE MEN. CAN YOU SPEAK TO THE

01:04:02.238 --> 01:04:03.472
DIFFERENCE IN WHAT HAPPENS WITH

01:04:03.539 --> 01:04:05.107
LIKE FOR EXAMPLE GETTING TIPS

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.809
OR THEIR CONTRACT IS THERE A

01:04:06.876 --> 01:04:08.544
DIFFERENCE IN HOW WE VALUE

01:04:08.611 --> 01:04:10.813
THESE JOBS ONE ONE BEING DONE

01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:15.651
BY A LEVINE AND ONE GET BE DONE.

01:04:15.718 --> 01:04:17.220
ONE BY ONE MA'AM. PREDOMINANT I

01:04:17.286 --> 01:04:19.689
KNOW. A MY GET UP FROM. WHO

01:04:19.755 --> 01:04:22.258
FELLOW AND THAT'S GREAT BUT- I

01:04:22.325 --> 01:04:24.393
PERSONALLY I NEVER A LATINA. OR

01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.795
O. WOMAN THAT IT'S A BILL

01:04:25.861 --> 01:04:28.798
PERCENT. AT ALWAYS AND IT'S

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:29.999
RIGHT AWAY BUT THE TIPS ARE

01:04:30.066 --> 01:04:35.338
MAKES THEM. YOU KNOW EARNED FOR-

01:04:35.404 --> 01:04:37.006
I GUESS OR I'M ASSUMING THAT

01:04:37.073 --> 01:04:41.911
BECAUSE- AS A HOUSEKEEPER THIS

01:04:41.978 --> 01:04:43.579
IS JUST REVISION OF THE WOMEN

01:04:43.646 --> 01:04:46.682
BUILD UP JOB. AND I DON'T THINK

01:04:46.749 --> 01:04:50.653
IT'S FAIR IT'S THEY THEY MADE-

01:04:50.720 --> 01:04:54.257
WITH THE UNION CONTRACT TO MAKE-

01:04:54.323 --> 01:04:56.792
GOOD MONEY BUT I BELIEVE THAT.

01:04:56.859 --> 01:04:59.395
THAT IS NOT ENOUGH AND YOU KNOW

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:00.529
AT THE MOMENT THEY MAKE MINIMUM

01:05:00.596 --> 01:05:02.431
WAGE BUT THE TIPS ARE WHAT MAKE

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:06.402
THEM MAKE MORE- THAT. THANK YOU

01:05:06.469 --> 01:05:08.204
IT'S JUST ONE OF THE THINGS SO

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:10.673
OFTEN- ESPECIALLY A JOBS HELD

01:05:10.740 --> 01:05:12.642
BY LATINOS A IN THIS IS WHY WE

01:05:12.708 --> 01:05:13.743
START THE ON SCENE MEDINA AND

01:05:13.809 --> 01:05:16.479
IS TO- GO UNSEEN RIGHT A LOT OF

01:05:16.545 --> 01:05:17.513
TIMES IF YOU STAY AT A HOTEL WE

01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:19.148
DON'T NECESSARILY SEE OUR HOTEL

01:05:19.215 --> 01:05:21.751
HOUSEKEEPER. AND WE FORGET THAT

01:05:21.817 --> 01:05:23.619
MAYBE WE SHOULD TAKE THEM TO

01:05:23.686 --> 01:05:24.920
WHERE WE SEE THE BELLBOY WE

01:05:24.987 --> 01:05:27.623
FEEL GUILTY AND SO YOU KNOW WE

01:05:27.690 --> 01:05:29.558
IMMEDIATELY TOOK THEM- AND SO

01:05:29.625 --> 01:05:31.927

CALIFORNIA OUR EQUAL PAY ADDED

TOWARDS ENSURING THAT WE HAVE

ECONOMIC STATUS OF LATINAS

01:39:43.877 --> 01:39:45.412
REPORT HAS BEEN AN IMPORTANT

01:39:45.479 --> 01:39:47.715
PART OF THIS WORK MANY OF THE

01:39:47.781 --> 01:39:50.050
DATA THAT IS HAS BEEN CITED

01:39:50.117 --> 01:39:52.853

BEEN REPORTED IN OUR ESL OUR

01:39:54.888 --> 01:39:58.125
REPORT FOR THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

01:39:58.192 --> 01:39:59.893
AS WE HEARD EARLIER IN

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:01.895
CALIFORNIA LATINAS MAKE FORTY

01:40:01.962 --> 01:40:03.364
TWO CENTS TO THE DOLLAR OF A

01:40:03.430 --> 01:40:06.066
WHITE MALE COUNTERPART. AND IN

HIGHLIGHTS SOME OTHER NUANCES

01:40:12.639 --> 01:40:14.575
THAT I'D LIKE TO POINT OUT

01:40:14.641 --> 01:40:16.777
BEFORE MOVING TO SOLUTIONS. WHY

01:40:16.844 --> 01:40:17.878
AND I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:20.581
AGAIN THAT CALIFORNIA'S PAY GAP

01:40:20.647 --> 01:40:22.383
FOR LATINAS IS THE LARGEST IN

01:40:22.449 --> 01:40:27.988
THE NATION. SECONDLY I'D LIKE

01:40:28.055 --> 01:40:32.025
TO UNDERSCORE. THAT ACROSS

01:40:32.092 --> 01:40:35.129
CALIFORNIA THE PAY GAP VARIES

01:40:35.195 --> 01:40:38.565
IN PLACES LIKE SAN JOSE IT IS

01:40:38.632 --> 01:40:41.268
THE LARGEST AT POINT THIRTY

01:40:41.335 --> 01:40:43.303
THREE CENTS PER DOLLAR AND IN

01:40:43.370 --> 01:40:45.606
PLACES SUCH AS FRESNO IT'S

01:40:45.672 --> 01:40:47.107
CLOSER TO FIFTY CENTS PER

01:40:47.174 --> 01:40:50.244
DOLLAR THIS IS IMPORTANT TO

01:40:50.310 --> 01:40:52.246
KNOW AS WE LOOK AT SOLUTIONS.

01:40:52.312 --> 01:40:53.547
FINALLY I'D LIKE TO UNDERSCORE

01:40:53.614 --> 01:40:56.183
AGAIN THE HOPES REPORT FINDS

01:40:56.250 --> 01:40:59.186
THAT THE PAY GAP PERSISTS NO

01:40:59.253 --> 01:41:01.021
MATTER THE LEVEL OF EDUCATION.

01:41:01.088 --> 01:41:03.357
THIS IS A FACT THAT WE CANNOT

01:41:03.424 --> 01:41:05.592
IGNORE OR LOOK AWAY FROM. ALL

01:41:05.659 --> 01:41:07.628
OF THESE NUANCES ARE IMPORTANT

01:41:07.694 --> 01:41:09.229
AS WE CONTINUE TO ELEVATE THIS

01:41:09.296 --> 01:41:10.964
CONVERSATION AND FURTHERMORE AS

01:41:11.031 --> 01:41:13.233
WE IDENTIFY A VARIETY OF

01:41:13.300 --> 01:41:15.002
SOLUTIONS TO MAKE PROGRESS ON

01:41:15.068 --> 01:41:22.976
THIS FRONT. THE ROOT CAUSE OF

01:41:23.043 --> 01:41:25.879
THE WAGE GAP IS DISCRIMINATION

01:41:25.946 --> 01:41:27.314
AS WE'VE HEARD FROM PERSONAL

01:41:27.381 --> 01:41:28.982
NARRATIVE IN THE DATA TODAY

01:41:29.049 --> 01:41:32.286
ROOTING OUT DISCRIMINATION IS A

01:41:32.352 --> 01:41:32.753
CRITICAL PIECE OF THIS

01:41:32.820 --> 01:41:37.691
CONVERSATION. NEXT I'D LIKE TO

01:41:37.758 --> 01:41:40.427
OFFER A FEW SOLUTIONS TO START

01:41:40.494 --> 01:41:42.763
TACKLING THIS ISSUE IN ADDITION

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:43.330
TO ALL THE PROGRESS THAT HAS

01:41:43.397 --> 01:41:46.400
BEEN MADE. EARLIER THE

01:41:46.467 --> 01:41:47.634
CALIFORNIA COMMISSION ON THE

TAKE ONLINE THIS INCENTIVE IS

01:41:55.642 --> 01:41:57.578
IMPORTANT THE NEXT STEP WOULD

01:41:57.644 --> 01:41:59.379
BE TO MAKE IT MANDATORY AND

01:41:59.446 --> 01:42:02.249
TRANSPARENT. I'D ALSO LIKE TO

01:42:02.316 --> 01:42:03.984
POINT TO A PROMISING PRACTICE

01:42:04.051 --> 01:42:06.220
IN MASSACHUSETTS A REALLY

01:42:06.286 --> 01:42:08.121
DIVERSE COALITION CALLED THE

01:42:08.188 --> 01:42:11.158

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.196
TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS

01:42:16.263 --> 01:42:19.266
TRANSPARENCY IN WAGES STATEWIDE

01:42:19.333 --> 01:42:20.534
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT IN

01:42:20.601 --> 01:42:22.202

01:44:34.701 --> 01:44:36.670
ABOUT LATINAS. THERE EITHER A

01:44:36.737 --> 01:44:39.573

THE GREAT EQUALIZER. AND WHAT'S

01:45:52.245 --> 01:45:53.313
IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT IT WAS

01:45:53.380 --> 01:45:55.682
VERY HARMFUL FOR LATINAS WHAT

01:45:59.720 --> 01:46:01.488
THE CLOSURES TO BUSINESS.

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:03.957
LEISURE HOSPITALITY LATINAS

01:46:04.024 --> 01:46:06.059
EXPERIENCE HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT

01:46:06.126 --> 01:46:07.194
RATE THIS WAS TWENTY POINT TWO

01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:08.995
PERCENT. MORE THAN ANY OTHER

01:46:09.062 --> 01:46:10.931
RACIAL ETHNIC GROUP GENDER X.

01:46:10.997 --> 01:46:13.600
CETERA. AND WHAT'S TERRIBLE IS

01:46:13.667 --> 01:46:14.601
THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO MOVE

01:46:14.668 --> 01:46:16.470
FORWARD FROM COVER NINETEEN

01:46:16.536 --> 01:46:18.572
INTO THE VARIANCE INTO. A POST

01:46:18.638 --> 01:46:20.073
PANDEMIC REALITY THAT STILL WE

01:46:20.140 --> 01:46:21.975
HAVE NOT MET YET CALIFORNIA'S

01:46:22.042 --> 01:46:22.743
MUCH FURTHER ALONG THAN THE

01:46:22.809 --> 01:46:24.478
REST OF THE COUNTRY. LATINAS

01:46:24.544 --> 01:46:27.447
REMAIN AT THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF

01:46:27.514 --> 01:46:28.949
UNEMPLOYMENT. NOW DURING THE

01:46:29.015 --> 01:46:30.784
PEAK PANDEMIC LATINAS LEFT THE

01:46:30.851 --> 01:46:32.219
LABOR FORCE WHEN I DESCRIBE

01:46:32.285 --> 01:46:33.253
THIS I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT

01:46:33.320 --> 01:46:34.621
THAT LEAVING THE LABOR FORCE IS

01:46:34.688 --> 01:46:36.156
LIKE DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE.

01:46:36.223 --> 01:46:37.224
IT'S GOING TO TAKE THAT MUCH

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.759
MORE TO GET SOMEBODY EN AND THE

01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:40.026
REASON THAT THIS MATTERS FOR

01:46:40.093 --> 01:46:42.095
LATINAS IS THAT THEIR YOUTHFUL

01:46:42.162 --> 01:46:43.430
THEY'RE LEAVING THE LABOR FORCE

01:46:43.497 --> 01:46:45.031
NOT. BECAUSE THEY'RE CLOSE TO

01:46:45.098 --> 01:46:46.867
RETIREMENT DURING THEIR PEAK

01:46:46.933 --> 01:46:48.935
WORK FORCE THIS IS THE PRIME OF

01:46:49.002 --> 01:46:51.304
THEIR CAREERS. AND SO LATINAS

01:46:51.371 --> 01:46:52.606
EXITED THE WORKFORCE AT A RATE

01:46:52.672 --> 01:46:54.574
THAT WAS NEARLY DOUBLE. THAN

01:46:54.641 --> 01:46:56.777
WHITE WOMEN. AGAIN LATINAS ARE

01:46:56.843 --> 01:46:58.078
THE CURRENT AND FUTURE WORK

01:46:58.145 --> 01:46:59.880
FORCE THEY ALSO. ARE THE

01:46:59.946 --> 01:47:00.814
BREADWINNERS OF LATINO

01:47:00.881 --> 01:47:02.716
HOUSEHOLDS DESPITE THE EQUAL

01:47:02.783 --> 01:47:04.751
PAY GAP SO THIS IS NOT JUST

01:47:04.818 --> 01:47:06.520
SOMETHING THAT IS AFFECTING.

01:47:06.586 --> 01:47:08.054
LATINO HOUSEHOLDS IT'S ALL

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:09.956
AMERICAN HOUSEHOLDS BECAUSE WE

01:47:10.023 --> 01:47:11.424
SAW FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY DEBT

01:47:11.491 --> 01:47:13.293
DATA. FROM THE CENSUS THERE IS

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:14.761
ONLY ONE DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP THAT

01:47:14.828 --> 01:47:15.862
IS NOT GROWING AND THAT'S-

01:47:15.929 --> 01:47:17.931
WHITE AMERICANS SO OUR ECONOMY

01:47:17.998 --> 01:47:19.566
IS PREDICATED ON WORKERS OF

01:47:19.633 --> 01:47:22.702
COLOR. AMERICA'S NEW MAJORITY.

01:47:22.769 --> 01:47:24.204
NOW OVER THE COURSE OF THE

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:26.106
PANDEMIC LATINAS A YOU KNOW

01:47:26.173 --> 01:47:27.941
DATE ESSENTIALLY EXPERIENCE THE

01:47:28.008 --> 01:47:29.709
LARGEST DROP IN LABOR FORCE AND

01:47:29.776 --> 01:47:31.344
SAID THIS IS THEM ACCIDENT.

01:47:31.411 --> 01:47:33.580
WHERE A YEAR OUT AND IT HAS NOT

01:47:33.647 --> 01:47:35.448
RECOVERED AND SO WE HEAR ABOUT

01:47:35.515 --> 01:47:36.183
HOW THERE ARE A LOT OF

01:47:36.249 --> 01:47:38.185
BUSINESSES THAT CAN'T FILL

01:47:38.251 --> 01:47:39.886
THEIR JOBS. WELL ONE OF THE

01:47:39.953 --> 01:47:41.054
THINGS IS THINKING ABOUT WHY

01:47:41.121 --> 01:47:43.723
THOSE JOBS- ARE NOT WORTH IT SO

01:47:43.790 --> 01:47:44.991
MANY LATINOS ESPECIALLY IN

01:47:45.058 --> 01:47:46.760
CALIFORNIA LAUGHTER HOUSE EVERY

01:47:46.827 --> 01:47:48.895
DAY TO PUT THEIR LIVES AND THE

01:47:48.962 --> 01:47:50.964
LIVES OF THEIR FAMILY MEMBERS.

01:47:51.031 --> 01:47:52.599
ON THE LINE SO THAT THEY COULD

01:47:52.666 --> 01:47:54.334
HAVE A ROOF OVER THEIR HEAD AND

01:47:54.401 --> 01:47:55.635
FOOD ON THEIR TABLE THESE WERE

01:47:55.702 --> 01:47:57.070
NOT JOBS THAT PROVIDED THE

01:47:57.137 --> 01:47:58.505
RETIREMENT SECURITY BENEFITS

01:47:58.572 --> 01:48:00.473
THE SICK PAID LEAVE. THE HEALTH

01:48:00.540 --> 01:48:01.775
CARE THAT'S QUALITY SO

01:48:01.842 --> 01:48:03.677
ULTIMATELY GETTING THOSE

01:48:03.743 --> 01:48:05.011
WORKERS BACK IS GOING TO BE

01:48:05.078 --> 01:48:06.546
INCUMBENT ON US HAVING GOOD

01:48:06.613 --> 01:48:10.750
JOBS INCLUDING GOOD UNION JOBS-

01:48:10.817 --> 01:48:12.686
I KIND OF TOUCHED ON THIS BUT-

01:48:12.752 --> 01:48:14.888
LATINOS WERE OVERREPRESENTED.

01:48:14.955 --> 01:48:17.090
IN VULNERABLE LOW WAGE WORK.

01:48:17.157 --> 01:48:18.892
AND SO THIS IS A THIS IS A BAR

01:48:18.959 --> 01:48:20.660
CHART THAT SHOWING YOU KNOW THE

01:48:20.727 --> 01:48:22.362
WOMEN SHARE POPULATION VERSUS

01:48:22.429 --> 01:48:23.997
THEIR SHARE OF LEISURE AND

01:48:24.064 --> 01:48:25.999
HOSPITALITY INDUSTRY BASED ON.

01:48:26.066 --> 01:48:28.034
RACIAL ETHNIC STATUS SO YOU'RE

01:48:28.101 --> 01:48:29.035
SAYING THAT LATINOS ARE

01:48:29.102 --> 01:48:31.071
OVERREPRESENTED COMPARED TO

01:48:31.137 --> 01:48:31.872
THEIR SHARE OF THE US

01:48:31.938 --> 01:48:34.074
POPULATION. THIS IS ALSO TRUE

01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:36.109
FOR BLACK WOMEN. AND SO THESE

01:48:36.176 --> 01:48:37.510
ARE VULNERABLE INDUSTRIES WE

01:48:37.577 --> 01:48:39.112
SAW THROUGHOUT TODAY'S HEARING

01:48:39.179 --> 01:48:41.181
THE ROLE OF BEING ON THE FRONT

01:48:41.248 --> 01:48:43.083
LINES. THE SEXUAL ASSAULTS THE

01:48:43.149 --> 01:48:45.051
SEXUAL HARASSMENT IN THE GROSS-

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:48.288
AN EQUAL ECONOMIC. DEPRIVATION

01:48:48.355 --> 01:48:48.855
THAT OCCURS FOR THESE WOMEN

01:48:48.922 --> 01:48:51.558
WORKERS. NOW HERE'S ANOTHER

01:48:51.625 --> 01:48:52.425
THING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT

01:48:52.492 --> 01:48:53.460
IN THIS IS SOMETHING THAT IF

01:48:53.526 --> 01:48:54.794
THE INFRASTRUCTURE BILL IS

01:48:54.861 --> 01:48:56.463
PASSED THROUGH THE US CONGRESS

01:48:56.529 --> 01:48:58.365
WILL. REALLY BE A GAME CHANGER

01:48:58.431 --> 01:48:59.833
LATINA SPENT MORE TIME ON

01:48:59.900 --> 01:49:01.401
FAMILY CAREVERSUS THEIR MALE

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:03.403
PEERS SAID THE LACK OF HAVING.

01:49:03.470 --> 01:49:04.971
AFFORDABLE CHILDCARE OR

01:49:05.038 --> 01:49:07.040
ELDERCARE PAID SICK LEAVE YOU

01:49:07.107 --> 01:49:10.010
NAME IT MEANT THAT IT WAS

01:49:10.076 --> 01:49:12.946
ALMOST- BETTER IN TERMS OF A

01:49:13.013 --> 01:49:14.514
SOCIAL UTILITY TO STAY HOME AND

01:49:14.581 --> 01:49:16.883
GO TO WORK. AND IT WAS JUST ON

01:49:16.950 --> 01:49:19.286
ACCEPTABLE TO HAVE TO PUT YOUR

01:49:19.352 --> 01:49:20.320
LIFE ON THE LINE WHEN YOU DID

01:49:20.387 --> 01:49:22.455
NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A PROVIDER.

01:49:22.522 --> 01:49:24.457
I KNOW THINKING ABOUT YOU-

01:49:24.524 --> 01:49:25.926
ASSEMBLY MEMBER GÓMEZ REYES

01:49:25.992 --> 01:49:27.294
AND IN THE ROLE OF THE INLAND

01:49:27.360 --> 01:49:28.261
EMPIRE AND THE LACK OF

01:49:28.328 --> 01:49:29.930
PROVIDERS THERE IN HOSPITALS.

01:49:29.996 --> 01:49:31.398
ARE YOU GOING TO GO TO WORK FOR

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:32.532
A JOB THAT IS NOT PAIN YOU'RE

01:49:32.599 --> 01:49:33.633
NOT GIVING YOU SICK LEAVE AND

01:49:33.700 --> 01:49:34.801
PUT YOUR KIDS AT WRESTLE

01:49:34.868 --> 01:49:36.636
SCHOOLS ARE CLOSED WE SHOULD

01:49:36.703 --> 01:49:38.305
NOT BE MAKING WORKERS IN THEIR

01:49:38.371 --> 01:49:39.839
MOST PRODUCTIVE YEARS MAKE

01:49:39.906 --> 01:49:41.841
THOSE CHOICES. ESPECIALLY WOMEN

01:49:41.908 --> 01:49:44.678
WORKERS- I'M NOT SURE SOMETHING

01:49:44.744 --> 01:49:45.712
IN TERMS OF THINKING ABOUT THE

01:49:45.779 --> 01:49:47.080
OPPORTUNITY IN THIS IS NOT JUST

01:49:47.147 --> 01:49:48.581
AN OPPORTUNITY FOR LATINOS THIS

01:49:48.648 --> 01:49:49.482
IS NOT AN OPPORTUNITY FOR

01:49:49.549 --> 01:49:51.518
CALIFORNIA. TEXAS AND FLORIDA

01:49:51.584 --> 01:49:52.585
THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO GROW

01:49:52.652 --> 01:49:54.587
THE AMERICAN ECONOMY. THERE IS

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:56.323
NO U. S. ECONOMY WITHOUT

01:49:56.389 --> 01:49:58.425
LETTING US SO THE LATINO DONOR

01:49:58.491 --> 01:49:59.759
COLLABORATIVE FOR THE LAST FOUR

01:49:59.826 --> 01:50:01.861
YEARS HAS CREATED A REMARKABLE

01:50:01.928 --> 01:50:03.396
REPORT CALLED THE LATINO GROSS

01:50:03.463 --> 01:50:05.699
DOMESTIC PRODUCT. THEY WERE

01:50:05.765 --> 01:50:07.834
ABLE. TO CALCULATE THAT THIS

01:50:07.901 --> 01:50:08.535
YEAR JUST CAME OUT IN

01:50:08.601 --> 01:50:10.670
SEPTEMBER- IF LATINOS IN THE U.

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:12.672
S. WHERE THEIR OWN COUNTRY THEY

01:50:12.739 --> 01:50:13.340
WOULD BE THE SEVENTH LARGEST

01:50:13.406 --> 01:50:14.874
GDP IN THE WORLD. THE

01:50:14.941 --> 01:50:16.443
RESPONSIBLE FOR ADDING TWO

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:18.411
POINT SEVEN TRILLION DOLLARS SO

01:50:18.478 --> 01:50:19.079
WHEN WE THINKABOUT THE

01:50:19.145 --> 01:50:20.680
AMERICAN RECOVERY ACT WHEN WE

01:50:20.747 --> 01:50:21.514
THINK ABOUT THE INFRASTRUCTURE

01:50:21.581 --> 01:50:23.583
SPENDING THAT IS LATINOS YEAR

01:50:23.650 --> 01:50:26.052
AFTER YEAR- ONE OF THE THINGS

01:50:26.119 --> 01:50:27.420
THAT'S IMPORTANT IS THAT THEY

01:50:27.487 --> 01:50:28.788
ARE THE GROWTH ECONOMY THEY'RE

01:50:28.855 --> 01:50:30.056
GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW.

01:50:30.123 --> 01:50:31.291
AGAIN WHEN WE THINK ABOUT THE

01:50:31.358 --> 01:50:34.828
DEMOGRAPHIC THAT IS NOT GROWING

01:50:34.894 --> 01:50:36.529
THAT IS UNSUSTAINABLE. ONE OF

01:50:36.596 --> 01:50:37.697
THE THINGS THAT DRIVES THE

01:50:37.764 --> 01:50:38.832
SECOND ON THE GROWTH IS LABOR

01:50:38.898 --> 01:50:40.934
FORCE PARTICIPATION SO THIS IS

01:50:41.001 --> 01:50:42.435
SOMETHING THAT IS IMPORTANT BUT

01:50:42.502 --> 01:50:44.337
ALSO ON THE LINE. GIVEN NOTHING

01:50:44.404 --> 01:50:45.905
AS ARE EXITING THE WORKFORCE.

01:50:45.972 --> 01:50:47.640
SO BY TWENTY TWENTY NINE OUR

01:50:47.707 --> 01:50:50.210
RESEARCH AT UCLA- ANTICIPATES

01:50:50.276 --> 01:50:51.578
THAT LATINAS WOULD BE

01:50:51.644 --> 01:50:53.113
RESPONSIBLE FOR ALMOST 10% OF

01:50:53.179 --> 01:50:55.015
THE US WORK FORCE. NOT WHAT'S

01:50:55.081 --> 01:50:56.282
IMPORTANT HERE IS THAT THE

01:50:56.349 --> 01:50:57.917
NUMBER OF LATINOS IN THE LABOR

01:50:57.984 --> 01:51:00.520
FORCE IS PROJECTED TO GROW. AT

01:51:00.587 --> 01:51:02.789
NINE TIMES THE RATE OF THEIR

01:51:02.856 --> 01:51:04.524
WHITE FEMALE PEERS. AND SO THEY

01:51:04.591 --> 01:51:05.859
NEED TO BE EMPLOYED IN GOOD

01:51:05.925 --> 01:51:08.328
JOBS RIGHT GOOD JOBS TO HAVE

01:51:08.395 --> 01:51:10.530
DISPOSABLE INCOME. TO GROW THE

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:12.832
ECONOMY TO CONTINUE TO CONSUME

01:51:12.899 --> 01:51:15.235
PURCHASE GOODS AND SERVICES.

01:51:15.301 --> 01:51:17.003
NOW WHAT CAN GOVERNMENT DO TO

01:51:17.070 --> 01:51:18.438
HELP A LOT THERE AND THERE'S A

01:51:18.505 --> 01:51:20.340
LOT OF OPPORTUNITY GIVEN THE

01:51:20.407 --> 01:51:23.009
ROBUST ARM RESOURCES SO PUBLIC

01:51:23.076 --> 01:51:24.411
SECTOR INVESTMENTS THAT MEET

01:51:24.477 --> 01:51:25.845
THE MOMENT INCLUDE INCREASING

01:51:25.912 --> 01:51:27.147
THE FEDERAL MINIMUM WAGE THIS

01:51:27.213 --> 01:51:29.616
JUST HAS TO HAPPEN- ONE OF THE

01:51:29.682 --> 01:51:30.383
THINGS WHEN I THINK ABOUT THE

01:51:30.450 --> 01:51:31.785
GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND

01:51:31.851 --> 01:51:33.019
THE WAY IN WHICH WERE ABLE TO

01:51:33.086 --> 01:51:34.020
VOTE FOR OUR ELECTED

01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:35.588
REPRESENTATIVES. IN SOME WAYS

01:51:35.655 --> 01:51:37.023
IT'S PARADOXICAL TO PLACES LIKE

01:51:37.090 --> 01:51:38.625
FLORIDA WHO VOTE DIFFERENTLY

01:51:38.691 --> 01:51:40.060
TOP OF THE TICKET BUT HAVE

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:41.327
PASSED THROUGH BALLOT

01:51:41.394 --> 01:51:42.862
INITIATIVES A FIFTEEN DOLLAR

01:51:42.929 --> 01:51:45.265
MINIMUM WAGE- IN FRANCHISE MEN

01:51:45.331 --> 01:51:46.533
IN VOTING RIGHTS FOR THOSE THAT

01:51:46.599 --> 01:51:48.535
WERE FORMALLY INCARCERATED AND

01:51:48.601 --> 01:51:49.869
SO SOMETIMES WE CAN LEARN

01:51:49.936 --> 01:51:51.704
SOMETHING BY LOOKING EAST BUT

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:53.039
ULTIMATELY WE HAVE THE

01:51:53.106 --> 01:51:54.974
OPPORTUNITY. AND THE OBLIGATION

01:51:55.041 --> 01:51:56.576
TO SHAPE WHAT HAPPENS WEST

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:58.578
EASTWARD AND SO WITHOUT SOME OF

01:51:58.645 --> 01:51:59.179
THE OTHER THINGS ARE REALLY

01:51:59.245 --> 01:52:00.513
THINKING ABOUT EARLY CHILDHOOD

01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:01.881
CARE WHICH I KNOW THE STATE OF

01:52:01.948 --> 01:52:03.550
CALIFORNIA VESTED A LOT THIS

01:52:03.616 --> 01:52:05.852
LAST LEGISLATIVE CYCLE- MAKING

01:52:05.919 --> 01:52:07.420
SURE THAT PEOPLE AND HOUSEHOLDS

01:52:07.487 --> 01:52:08.621
ARE AWARE OF THIS CHILD TAX

01:52:08.688 --> 01:52:10.256
CREDIT SO. EVEN THOUGH WE

01:52:10.323 --> 01:52:11.491
CREATE THINGS ARE STILL NEEDS

01:52:11.558 --> 01:52:12.725
TO BE THE TRUSTED MESSENGERS

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:14.494
WHETHER IT'S THE UNIONS OR THE

01:52:14.561 --> 01:52:16.129
HOPES ARE THE MANASA NDA GOES

01:52:16.196 --> 01:52:17.097
OF THE WORLD THAT CAN ACTUALLY

01:52:17.163 --> 01:52:18.698
GET THAT MESSAGE OUT AND ENSURE

01:52:18.765 --> 01:52:20.867
PEOPLE APPLY- AND THEN

01:52:20.934 --> 01:52:22.469
ULTIMATELY WE NEED TO REINFORCE

01:52:22.535 --> 01:52:24.437
STATE AND LOCAL I. LAWS THAT

01:52:24.504 --> 01:52:25.138
SPECIFICALLY PROHIBIT

01:52:25.205 --> 01:52:27.140
DISCRIMINATION. ENFORCEMENT'S A

01:52:27.207 --> 01:52:29.409
BIG ISSUE SO WE CONTINUE TO

01:52:29.476 --> 01:52:31.377
HAVE COLLATERAL CONSEQUENCES

01:52:31.444 --> 01:52:32.979
AND DISCRIMINATORY ENFORCEMENT

01:52:33.046 --> 01:52:34.814
AROUND ARE UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS

01:52:34.881 --> 01:52:35.715
WERE ON THE FRONT LINES DOING

01:52:35.782 --> 01:52:37.250
ESSENTIAL WORK BUT WE'RE NOT

01:52:37.317 --> 01:52:38.852
INVESTING THE SAME AMOUNT AS

01:52:38.918 --> 01:52:40.153
FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AN OSHA AND

01:52:40.220 --> 01:52:41.821
MAKING SURE THAT THEY'RE SAFE.

01:52:41.888 --> 01:52:43.323
PLACES THAT PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY

01:52:43.389 --> 01:52:45.125
NOT BEING VICTIMS OF WAGE THEFT

01:52:45.191 --> 01:52:45.825
SO THERE NEEDS TO BE AN

01:52:45.892 --> 01:52:47.527
IMBALANCE THAT IS CORRECTED

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:49.095
THERE SO THAT IT BALANCES OUT

01:52:49.162 --> 01:52:51.364
AND GROWS OUR ECONOMY- I JUST

01:52:51.431 --> 01:52:52.599
WANT TO CLOSE AND SAY THANK YOU

01:52:52.665 --> 01:52:53.733
I THINK THAT WE ALL HAVE A ROLE

01:52:53.800 --> 01:52:54.901
TO PLAY IN THIS AND IF WE DON'T

01:52:54.968 --> 01:52:58.071
DO SOMETHING NOW. WE ALL WILL

01:52:58.138 --> 01:53:00.340
BE SCREWED. THANKS THANK YOU.

01:53:00.406 --> 01:53:03.543
THE LAST NIGHT I. AND I WANT TO

01:53:03.610 --> 01:53:04.444
THE STATE BECAUSE I KNOW

01:53:04.511 --> 01:53:05.512
THERE'S BEEN TO BE QUITE I'M

01:53:05.578 --> 01:53:06.513
JUST START BY THAT YOU KNOW

01:53:06.579 --> 01:53:08.448
SOMETIMES I GET FRUSTRATED

01:53:08.515 --> 01:53:09.782
BECAUSE IF YOU LOOK AT THE

01:53:09.849 --> 01:53:11.117
THINGS WE'VE DONE AND SOME OF

01:53:11.184 --> 01:53:11.985
THE THINGS THAT ARE SUGGESTED

01:53:12.051 --> 01:53:13.553
WE'VE DONE IT YOU KNOW WE SAID

01:53:13.620 --> 01:53:15.722
YOU CAN'T ASK ABOUT PRIOR-

01:53:15.788 --> 01:53:17.891
SALARY SALARY WE SAID THERE'S

01:53:17.957 --> 01:53:19.259
GOTTO BE SOME TRANSPARENCY- WE

01:53:19.325 --> 01:53:20.760
WORKED ON THE BILL WIH THEM SO

01:53:20.827 --> 01:53:22.328
MUCH OF IT WE WORK WITH THAT

01:53:22.395 --> 01:53:23.196
ARE FORMERSENATOR HANNAH BETH

01:53:23.263 --> 01:53:24.864
JACKSON WHO. REALLY LED THE WAY

01:53:24.931 --> 01:53:26.032
ON A LOT OF THE STUFF YOU KNOW

01:53:26.099 --> 01:53:27.367
WE'VE EXPANDED PAID LEAVE WE'VE

01:53:27.433 --> 01:53:28.868
INCREASED THE MINIMUM WAGE I

01:53:28.935 --> 01:53:29.969
MEAN YOU NAME IT WE'VE DONE IT

01:53:30.036 --> 01:53:32.605
RIGHT WE CONTINUE TO LEAD AND

01:53:32.672 --> 01:53:34.741
YET CALIFORNIA IS FURTHER

01:53:34.807 --> 01:53:36.709
BEHIND AND CONTINUE TO FALL

01:53:36.776 --> 01:53:38.077
EVEN FARTHER BEHIND THAN THE

01:53:38.144 --> 01:53:40.046
REST OF THE NATION AND DURING

01:53:40.113 --> 01:53:41.514
THE PANDEMIC- I MEAN WITH THE

01:53:41.581 --> 01:53:43.516
NUMBER YOU'LL SEE. YOU KNOW-

01:53:43.583 --> 01:53:45.652
LATINOS NATIONWIDE WERE ABOUT

01:53:45.718 --> 01:53:47.153
FIFTY FIVE CENTS A DOLLAR NOW

01:53:47.220 --> 01:53:47.720
FIFTY SEVEN I THINK THAT'S

01:53:47.787 --> 01:53:48.555
PROBABLY BECAUSE SOME OF THE

01:53:48.621 --> 01:53:49.856
STATE'S IT LIFTED THE MINIMUM

01:53:49.923 --> 01:53:51.291
WAGE PROBABLY HELPED AND

01:53:51.357 --> 01:53:52.425
PROBABLY LATINAS WHO DROPPED

01:53:52.492 --> 01:53:54.294
OUT OF WORKFORCE CHANGE THE

01:53:54.360 --> 01:53:55.461
NUMBERS UNFORTUNATELY ON FROM

01:53:55.528 --> 01:53:57.463
THAT BUT EVEN IN CALIFORNIA

01:53:57.530 --> 01:54:00.066
WHERE THAT HAPPENS- WE'RE STILL

01:54:00.133 --> 01:54:02.168
FORTY TWO CENTS SO WHAT. AT

01:54:02.235 --> 01:54:03.603
IT'S FRUSTRATING BECAUSE IN

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.371
SOME WAYS IT'S LIKE WHAT ARE WE

01:54:05.438 --> 01:54:07.207
DOING WRONG AND I DO THINK THAT

01:54:07.273 --> 01:54:09.075
THAT THERE IS DISCRIMINATION

01:54:09.142 --> 01:54:10.843
BUT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR SISTERS

01:54:10.910 --> 01:54:12.045
WHO ARE AFRICAN AMERICAN THERE

01:54:12.111 --> 01:54:13.646
THEY I WOULD ARGUE FACE THE

01:54:13.713 --> 01:54:15.348
SAME IF NOT MORE DISCRIMINATION

01:54:15.415 --> 01:54:16.816
AT LEAST EQUAL DISCRIMINATION

01:54:16.883 --> 01:54:19.419
LEVINE AS SO LIKE WHAT IS IT

01:54:19.485 --> 01:54:22.989
LIKE WHAT CAN WE DO- WHY IS

01:54:23.056 --> 01:54:23.957
CALIFORNIA FALLING SO YEAH.

01:54:24.023 --> 01:54:25.058
WELL I THINK THAT CALIFORNIA'S

01:54:25.124 --> 01:54:26.059
FALLING BEHIND BECAUSE WE'RE

01:54:26.125 --> 01:54:27.894
GROWING INCOME INEQUALITY AND

01:54:27.961 --> 01:54:29.395
SO IT'S A TALE OF THE RICHES

01:54:29.462 --> 01:54:31.731
WHICH IN ENDEAVORED THIS HUGE

01:54:31.798 --> 01:54:33.833
SURPLUS BUT WITH THAT WE HAVE

01:54:33.900 --> 01:54:35.201
TO BE CREATIVE SO THE UNIVERSAL

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:36.736
STRATEGY IN CALIFORNIA IS NOT

01:54:36.803 --> 01:54:38.371
THE STRATEGY THAT WE NEED TO

01:54:38.438 --> 01:54:40.306
RELY FULLY ON WE NEED TO THINK

01:54:40.373 --> 01:54:42.375
ABOUT TARGETS SO WHEN YOU TALK

01:54:42.442 --> 01:54:43.309
ABOUT YOU KNOW WE'VE DONE ALL

01:54:43.376 --> 01:54:44.677
OF THESE THINGS I. I THINK

01:54:44.744 --> 01:54:45.778
ABOUT THE COVER NINETEEN

01:54:45.845 --> 01:54:47.113
PANDEMIC SO SURE WE HAD A LOT

01:54:47.180 --> 01:54:48.648
OF VACCINES BUT THERE WAS A LOT

01:54:48.715 --> 01:54:49.682
OF WORK TO DO TO MAKE SURE THAT

01:54:49.749 --> 01:54:51.851
THOSE VACCINES ACTUALLY GOT TO

01:54:51.918 --> 01:54:53.686
FRONTLINE ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND

01:54:53.753 --> 01:54:56.022
SO THERE WHAT WAS REQUIRED AS

01:54:56.089 --> 01:54:57.390
COMMUNITY CLINICS AND NOT

01:54:57.457 --> 01:54:59.092
INFRASTRUCTURE COMMUNITY BASED

01:54:59.158 --> 01:54:59.626
ORGANIZATIONS AND TRUSTED

01:54:59.692 --> 01:55:03.896
MESSENGERS- SO I THINK THAT THE-

01:55:03.963 --> 01:55:04.764
IN THE SAN. NEEDS TO GO THE

01:55:04.831 --> 01:55:06.432
POPULAR. FOR INFORM. VERSUS

01:55:06.499 --> 01:55:07.834
LETTING IT FIRST IN TIME THAT'S

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:09.335
NOT GONNA WORK. AND THEN THE

01:55:09.402 --> 01:55:10.703
SECOND THING IS THAT WE NEED TO

01:55:10.770 --> 01:55:11.704
CONTINUE TO DOUBLE DOWN AND

01:55:11.771 --> 01:55:12.839
GROWING OUR CIVIL SOCIETY

01:55:12.905 --> 01:55:15.174
INFRASTRUCTURE. ULTIMATELY WITH

01:55:15.241 --> 01:55:16.342
THE SPREAD OF DISINFORMATION

01:55:16.409 --> 01:55:18.478
AND MISINFORMATION WE'RE SEEING

01:55:18.544 --> 01:55:19.679
THAT PEOPLE'S TRUST IN

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:20.613
GOVERNMENT IS NOT WHERE IT

01:55:20.680 --> 01:55:22.048
NEEDS TO BE IN THOSE NOT ARE

01:55:22.115 --> 01:55:23.683
NOT ALWAYS THE BEST MESSENGERS.

01:55:23.750 --> 01:55:25.518
BUT IF YOU GO TO WORK SITE

01:55:25.585 --> 01:55:26.886
SERVE YOU'RE GOING TO COMMUNITY

01:55:26.953 --> 01:55:29.088
ORGANIZATIONS- IF YOU'RE GOING

01:55:29.155 --> 01:55:30.490
TO SCHOOLS SCHOOLS ARE REALLY

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:31.791
GOOD SITE FOR REACHING LATINO

01:55:31.858 --> 01:55:33.059
FAMILIES IN ASIAN AMERICAN

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:34.227
FAMILIES. BECAUSE THEIR

01:55:34.294 --> 01:55:35.828
YOUTHFUL THAT COULD PROVIDE AN

01:55:35.895 --> 01:55:37.363
OPPORTUNITY AND SO I THINK IT'S

01:55:37.430 --> 01:55:39.632
JUST AMOUNT OF. TARGETING AND

01:55:39.699 --> 01:55:40.833
THEN ENSURING YOU HAVE THE

01:55:40.900 --> 01:55:42.168
PEOPLE AND THE BOOTS ON THE

01:55:42.235 --> 01:55:42.969
GROUND THAT CAN GET THAT

01:55:43.036 --> 01:55:45.238
MESSAGE. THAT PEOPLE GO FROM

01:55:45.305 --> 01:55:48.107
ACCESS TO ACTUALLY APPLYING.

01:55:48.174 --> 01:55:51.311
AND MATRICULATING INTO ANY SORT

01:55:51.377 --> 01:55:52.845
OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. THANK

01:55:52.912 --> 01:55:54.380
YOU ARE THEIR DIVISIONAL I'M

01:55:54.447 --> 01:55:54.881
SURE THERE'S ADDITIONAL

01:55:54.947 --> 01:55:59.919
QUESTIONS. CRISTINA AND THEN. I

01:55:59.986 --> 01:56:02.755
THINK THERE'S MORE OF A COMMENT

01:56:02.822 --> 01:56:04.891
ON YOUR LAST SET OF YOUR

01:56:04.957 --> 01:56:07.093
RESPONSE- WITH THE VACCINE IN

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.561
PARTICULAR I WANT TO MAKE IT

01:56:08.628 --> 01:56:09.562
CLEAR TO THOSE WITHIN THAT

01:56:09.629 --> 01:56:10.930
THERE ARE GROUPS ON THE GROUND

01:56:10.997 --> 01:56:12.231
WHO ARE DOING THE WORK AND ARE

01:56:12.298 --> 01:56:13.633
THE RESPECTED AND TRUSTED

01:56:13.700 --> 01:56:15.702
pMESSENGERS I THINK WE HAVE A

01:56:15.768 --> 01:56:17.403
SYSTEM WITHIN OUR GOVERNMENT

01:56:17.470 --> 01:56:19.572
THAT TRIES TO FORCE A MODEL

01:56:19.639 --> 01:56:21.040
THAT THIS AND WORK WITH AND

01:56:21.107 --> 01:56:22.008
WHAT WE HAPPENS I THINK WE NEED

01:56:22.075 --> 01:56:24.077
TO. FIRST AND FOREMOST WE THINK

01:56:24.143 --> 01:56:25.745
THAT- IS TO SAY THAT THERE'S

01:56:25.812 --> 01:56:27.647
NOTHING THERE- WHEN WE NEED

01:56:27.714 --> 01:56:28.748
THAT INFRASTRUCTURE WHETHER TO

01:56:28.815 --> 01:56:30.283
GIVE ACTINGSOUTH P. P. OR EVEN

01:56:30.350 --> 01:56:31.851
INFORMATION ABOUT OUR RIGHTS

01:56:31.918 --> 01:56:34.220
THAT ARE OUT THERE ARE IN SEOUL

01:56:34.287 --> 01:56:35.621
DEFINITELY INTERESTED IN IDEAS

01:56:35.688 --> 01:56:37.857
OF HOW WE START TO CHANGE THAT

01:56:37.924 --> 01:56:40.026
NARRATIVE FROM OUR POSITION- SO

01:56:40.093 --> 01:56:41.794
THAT WE'RE PUTTING TO WORK THE

01:56:41.861 --> 01:56:43.162
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE WE ARE

01:56:43.229 --> 01:56:45.098
RESOURCE RICH COMMUNITY OUT

01:56:45.164 --> 01:56:46.766
THERE BUT WHEN YOU TALK TO

01:56:46.833 --> 01:56:47.900
FOLKS WHO ARE AT THE LIKE

01:56:47.967 --> 01:56:49.135
THERE'S NOTHING AVAILABLE I'M

01:56:49.202 --> 01:56:49.769
LIKE WELL THERE'S NOTHING

01:56:49.836 --> 01:56:50.970
AVAILABLE AND THE WAY THAT IT'S

01:56:51.037 --> 01:56:51.971
ALWAYS BEEN NUMBER THAT HASN'T.

01:56:52.038 --> 01:56:54.040
WORKED FOR US IN THE WITHIN

01:56:54.107 --> 01:56:55.007
THAT WATER SOME RECOMMENDATIONS

01:56:55.074 --> 01:56:56.309
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE FOR US SO I

01:56:56.376 --> 01:56:57.443
THINK THIS IS IMPORTANT RATE

01:56:57.510 --> 01:56:59.779
AND I THINK ABOUT THE PAST

01:56:59.846 --> 01:57:00.747
NINETEEN MONTHS THAT WE'VE ALL

01:57:00.813 --> 01:57:02.281
EXPERIENCED IN THIS COLLECTIVE

01:57:02.348 --> 01:57:03.916
PSYCHE THAT IS TRANSFORM THE

01:57:03.983 --> 01:57:04.884
WAY THAT WE LIVE WORK AND EVEN

01:57:04.951 --> 01:57:07.353
PLAY- AND SO WE NEED TO

01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:09.055
REMEMBER THAT COBEN NINETEEN IS

01:57:09.122 --> 01:57:10.890
NOT THE LAST CRISES WE'RE GOING

01:57:10.957 --> 01:57:12.058
TO CONTINUE TO HAVE WILD FIRES

01:57:12.125 --> 01:57:13.626
WE SEE NOT FOR THE LAST FOUR

01:57:13.693 --> 01:57:14.761
YEARS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT OTHER

01:57:14.827 --> 01:57:16.295
PUBLIC EPIDEMIC IS GOING TO BE

01:57:16.362 --> 01:57:18.030
THERE WE KNOW WE HAVE. GROSS

01:57:18.097 --> 01:57:20.700
HOUSING AND SECURITY AND SO HOW

01:57:20.767 --> 01:57:22.135
CAN WE STABILIZE OUR CIVIL

01:57:22.201 --> 01:57:24.170
SOCIETY SECTOR SO THAT THEY CAN

01:57:24.237 --> 01:57:25.938
BE RESPONSIVE FOR THIS RESEARCH

01:57:26.005 --> 01:57:28.241
HEAVY- JURISDICTION THAT WERE

01:57:28.307 --> 01:57:29.909
ANSWER THOSE RESOURCES ACTUALLY

01:57:29.976 --> 01:57:31.444
PENETRATE SOME OF THE THINGS I

01:57:31.511 --> 01:57:32.612
THINK ABOUT IS THAT YOU KNOW

01:57:32.678 --> 01:57:33.813
THERE ARE TIMES WERE DIGITAL

01:57:33.880 --> 01:57:35.014
MATTERS AND THERE'S TIMES WERE

01:57:35.081 --> 01:57:37.216
DIGITAL FIRST DOESN'T AND SO

01:57:37.283 --> 01:57:38.618
WHEN YOU HAVE ACCESS TO

01:57:38.684 --> 01:57:40.553
SOMETHING SO VITAL THAT IS LIFE

01:57:40.620 --> 01:57:42.555
OR DEATH SURELY. BASED ON

01:57:42.622 --> 01:57:44.957
INTERNET AND A SYSTEM THAT IS

01:57:45.024 --> 01:57:46.859
NOT CULTURALLY COMPETENT OR

01:57:46.926 --> 01:57:48.594
EASY TO USE AND SOMETHING THAT

01:57:48.661 --> 01:57:49.929
MAYBE AS EASY FOR TWENTY YEAR

01:57:49.996 --> 01:57:51.164
OLDS AND THIRTY YEAR OLDS THEY

01:57:51.230 --> 01:57:52.832
WERE MISSING THE MARK- AND

01:57:52.899 --> 01:57:53.800
THAT'S WHY YOU'RE STILL GONNA

01:57:53.866 --> 01:57:55.401
NEED OBVIOUSLY THAT

01:57:55.468 --> 01:58:00.873
MOBILIZATION I DO. A LOT OF

01:58:00.940 --> 01:58:01.441
WORK ON VOTING RIGHTS AND-

THAT DO WORK FOR YOUTH

01:59:53.653 --> 01:59:55.555
ENGAGEMENT. THERE'S A LOT OF

01:59:55.621 --> 01:59:56.856
DIFFERENT PLACES THAT HAVE BEEN

01:59:56.923 --> 01:59:58.457
MADE POSSIBLE BECAUSE OF SOCIAL

01:59:58.524 --> 01:59:59.425
POLICY THROUGH THE FEDERAL

01:59:59.492 --> 02:00:01.160
GOVERNMENT STATE GOVERNMENT BUT

02:00:01.227 --> 02:00:02.695
THEY'RE NOT GOVERNMENT. BUT THE

02:00:02.762 --> 02:00:04.931
GREAT THING ISOFTENTIMES THERE

02:00:04.997 --> 02:00:06.766

WITH HOUSING AND LOW INCOME

02:00:11.404 --> 02:00:12.972
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. SO THOSE

02:00:13.039 --> 02:00:14.540
ARE PLACES TO INVEST SO THAT

02:00:14.607 --> 02:00:16.142
THEY CAN GET THE MESSAGE OUT

02:00:16.208 --> 02:00:16.776
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I THINK

02:00:16.842 --> 02:00:18.244

02:05:13.272 --> 02:05:15.040
WHAT I WAS BEFORE I CAME TO THE

02:05:15.107 --> 02:05:17.610
LEGISLATURE. AND WILL EARN LESS

02:05:17.676 --> 02:05:18.978
ALSO BASED ON MY AGE BRACKET

02:05:19.044 --> 02:05:20.779
WHEN I GRADUATED COLLEGE I

02:05:20.846 --> 02:05:23.916
GRADUATED DURING- BUT LUCKILY I

02:05:23.983 --> 02:05:24.483
WAS ABLE TO GRADUATE COLLEGE

02:05:24.550 --> 02:05:26.652
AND NOT BE. A STUDENT I WENT IN

02:05:26.719 --> 02:05:28.821
AND THEN DROPPED OUT BUT IT WAS

02:05:28.888 --> 02:05:30.923
INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT AND HARD-

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:32.858
COMMUNITY COLLEGE CAL STATE AND

02:05:32.925 --> 02:05:34.693
THEN FINALLY A GRADUATE SCHOOL.

02:05:34.760 --> 02:05:36.729
AND I KNOW THAT I AM EARNING

02:05:36.795 --> 02:05:38.664
LESS THAN THE GENERATIONS THAT

02:05:38.731 --> 02:05:41.734
CAME BEFORE ME. AND THAT IS A

02:05:41.800 --> 02:05:43.502
REALITY SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT.

02:05:43.569 --> 02:05:45.838
THE LATINA PAY EQUITY GAP IN

02:05:45.905 --> 02:05:48.440
TERMS OF WORKING CLASS WOMEN

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:50.042
MIDDLE CLASS EARNERS HIGH

02:05:50.109 --> 02:05:51.977
INCOME EARNERS THE C. SUITE

02:05:52.044 --> 02:05:55.281
WHATEVER LOOKS LIKE THERE IS A

02:05:55.347 --> 02:05:57.449
HUGE GAP. AND EVEN WITHIN THE

02:05:57.516 --> 02:05:59.785
GOVERNMENT STRUCTURE. WHY WOULD

02:05:59.852 --> 02:06:01.520
WE WANT TO DO THIS JOB IS A

02:06:01.587 --> 02:06:03.489
HUGE HUGE QUESTION IT TAKES YOU

02:06:03.555 --> 02:06:05.858
AWAY FROM YOUR FAMILY IT TAKES

02:06:05.925 --> 02:06:08.027
YOU AWAY FROM YOUR COMMUNITY

02:06:08.093 --> 02:06:09.428
YOUR OFTEN ISOLATED IN

02:06:09.495 --> 02:06:11.530
SACRAMENTO AND LUCKILY FOR SOME

02:06:11.597 --> 02:06:12.831
OF US WERE ABLE TO BUILD

02:06:12.898 --> 02:06:14.433
COMMUNITY AND BE ABLE TO PUSH

02:06:14.500 --> 02:06:15.634
THINGS FORWARD WHICH IS

02:06:15.701 --> 02:06:17.102
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO HAVE

02:06:17.169 --> 02:06:18.971
THAT ALLY SHIP IN PARTNERSHIP.

02:06:19.038 --> 02:06:20.306
BUT IT IS DIFFICULT AND EVEN

02:06:20.372 --> 02:06:22.308
WITHIN GOVERNMENT AGAIN TO THE

02:06:22.374 --> 02:06:23.175
QUESTION AND THIS IS A

02:06:23.242 --> 02:06:24.310
CONVERSATION THAT I HAD WITH

02:06:24.376 --> 02:06:25.611
ANOTHER COLLEAGUE FROM MY VERY

02:06:25.678 --> 02:06:27.880
AFFLUENT AREA WITH RELATIONS TO

02:06:27.947 --> 02:06:29.214
COLD IN THE GRAPHICS THAT WE

02:06:29.281 --> 02:06:31.417
SAW THAT IMPACTED MORE WOMEN

02:06:31.483 --> 02:06:32.484

SPECIFICALLY AND THAT SIXTY

02:06:34.820 --> 02:06:36.889
THOUSAND. PLUS PEOPLE THAT HAVE

02:06:36.956 --> 02:06:38.457
DIED ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE

02:06:38.524 --> 02:06:39.558
OF COAL BUT IN THE LAST

02:06:39.625 --> 02:06:41.060
NINETEEN MONTHS MOST OF WHOM

EXPERIENCE THE PANDEMIC IN THE

02:06:46.765 --> 02:06:49.301
SAME WAY. AND SO I REMEMBER

02:06:49.368 --> 02:06:50.636
HAVING A CONVERSATION WITH A

02:06:50.703 --> 02:06:51.904

02:08:21.660 --> 02:08:22.995
WHY THIS CONVERSATION IS

02:08:23.062 --> 02:08:25.297
IMPORTANT THIS IS WHY THE

02:08:25.364 --> 02:08:26.532
EXPERTS IN THE FIELD ARE

02:08:26.598 --> 02:08:27.966
IMPORTANT BECAUSE THESE

02:08:28.033 --> 02:08:29.101
CONVERSATIONS WERE NOT

02:08:29.168 --> 02:08:31.370
HAPPENING IN A PUBLIC WAY AND

HAVE BEEN LACKING FOR QUITE

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:34.073
SOME TIME AND I THINK THAT WE

02:08:35.240 --> 02:08:37.342
INCREDIBLE POWERFUL DIRECTION.

02:08:39.912 --> 02:08:41.013
THAT IN ORDER FOR OUR

02:08:41.080 --> 02:08:43.048
COMMUNITIES TO THRIVE AND IF WE

02:08:43.115 --> 02:08:44.316
ARE TRULY GOING TO LOOK AT

02:08:44.383 --> 02:08:46.351
LEVINE AS BEING THE LARGEST

02:08:46.418 --> 02:08:47.252
POPULATION IN THE STATE AND

02:08:47.319 --> 02:08:49.855
THE- THE BREADWINNERS AND MANY

02:08:49.922 --> 02:08:50.889
FAMILIES AND THE LATINO

02:08:50.956 --> 02:08:52.291
COMMUNITY GROWING BEING THE

02:08:52.357 --> 02:08:54.393
FASTEST GROWING. POPULATION

02:08:54.460 --> 02:08:56.295
ACROSS THE NATION THEN IT IS A

02:08:56.361 --> 02:08:58.630
CONVERSATION ABOUT THE FUTURE

02:08:58.697 --> 02:08:59.798
OF OUR STATE AND THE FUTURE OF

THIS COUNTRY THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:04.536
TIED WITH ECONOMIC JUSTICE

02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:06.805
INCOME INEQUALITY WORKFORCE

02:09:06.872 --> 02:09:09.708
DEVELOPMENT- AND CLEARLY

02:09:09.775 --> 02:09:11.043
REPRESENTATION THAT MATTERS AND

02:09:11.110 --> 02:09:12.544
THAT BRINGS THOSE VOICES TO THE

02:09:12.611 --> 02:09:14.046
TABLE SO I'M JUST I THINK

02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:14.980
THERE'S SO MUCH WORK AND SO

02:09:15.047 --> 02:09:15.948
MANY IDEAS THAT ARE GOING TO

02:09:16.014 --> 02:09:17.249
COME OUT OF THIS HEARING TODAY

02:09:17.316 --> 02:09:19.017

BELIEVER IN AND NOT REINVENTING

02:09:38.504 --> 02:09:40.606
THE WHEEL- WHEN I FIRST STARTED

02:09:40.672 --> 02:09:42.441
TO GET INVOLVED IN AFFIRMATIVE

02:09:42.508 --> 02:09:44.543
ACTION THERE WAS THIS

02:09:44.610 --> 02:09:46.445
DISCUSSION ABOUT WHITE MEN. AND

02:09:46.512 --> 02:09:47.913
THE FACT THAT AFTER AMERICAN

02:09:47.980 --> 02:09:49.548
MEN COULDN'T KEEP PACE AND IT

02:09:49.615 --> 02:09:52.317
WAS CHAU LOS SIX- I'M OLDER

02:09:52.384 --> 02:09:54.052
THAN A LOT OF UNITS FROM CHAU.

02:09:54.119 --> 02:09:55.454
HI THIS IS WHEN WE HAD

02:09:55.521 --> 02:09:57.322
AFFIRMATIVE ACTION. THEN IT

02:09:57.389 --> 02:09:58.457
BECAME A DISCUSSION ABOUT HOW

02:09:58.524 --> 02:10:00.159
WHAT WHITE WOMEN WERE OUTPACING

02:10:00.225 --> 02:10:03.462
BLACK MEN AND NEITHER ONE OF US

02:10:03.529 --> 02:10:05.464
IS CATCHING UP WITH WHITE MEN-

02:10:05.531 --> 02:10:08.066
AND NOW. WHEN I BRING THIS UP

02:10:08.133 --> 02:10:09.568
ABOUT YOU KNOW BRING IT BACK

02:10:09.635 --> 02:10:10.836
FROM A FACTION FOR WOULD WE

02:10:10.903 --> 02:10:12.871
NEED TO DO TO BE INTENTIONAL.

02:10:12.938 --> 02:10:15.140
SO THAT WE COULD WE COULD EVEN

02:10:15.207 --> 02:10:18.710
THINGS- ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

02:10:18.777 --> 02:10:19.278
WAS INTERESTING I WOULD GET

02:10:19.344 --> 02:10:22.548
PUSHED BACK. FROM WHITE MEN WHO

02:10:22.614 --> 02:10:24.583
WOULD SAY YEAH BUT LOOK A BLACK

02:10:24.650 --> 02:10:26.351
WOMEN. IN A RESEARCH ISSUE THAT

02:10:26.418 --> 02:10:27.219
SHOWED A BLACK WOMAN WERE

02:10:27.286 --> 02:10:29.321
OUTPACING WHITE MEN GOING TO

02:10:29.388 --> 02:10:31.290
COLLEGE THEIR ORDER DO MORE

02:10:31.356 --> 02:10:33.458
BLACK WOMEN ON BOARDS IN THE

02:10:33.525 --> 02:10:36.528
BLACK MEN. BOB MY SISTERS ARE

02:10:36.595 --> 02:10:38.430
DEFINITELY DOING SOME RIGHT.

02:10:38.497 --> 02:10:40.132
THEY ARE STARTING TO FIGURE

02:10:40.199 --> 02:10:42.668
THIS COMPLEX THING OUT OR ITS

02:10:42.734 --> 02:10:44.970
INTENTIONAL LIKE THEY THE

02:10:45.037 --> 02:10:46.505
PREDOMINATE GROUP ONLY WANT TO

02:10:46.572 --> 02:10:48.507
WHITE WOMEN ON BOARDS ONLY WANT

02:10:48.574 --> 02:10:50.342
TO WORK HAVE THEM GET CONTRACT.

02:10:50.409 --> 02:10:52.344
NOW MAYBE IT'S SHIFTED TO THAT

02:10:52.411 --> 02:10:53.912
BUT I AND THIS IS PROBABLY MORE

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:57.149
FOR THE UCLA POLICY INITIATIVE

02:10:57.216 --> 02:10:58.250
TO. LET'S NOT REINVENT THE

02:10:58.317 --> 02:10:59.851
WHEEL LET'S SEE WHAT HAS GONE

02:10:59.918 --> 02:11:01.787
ON IN THE PAST LET'S EXAMINE

02:11:01.853 --> 02:11:04.823
WHY. BLACK WOMEN WHITE WOMEN

02:11:04.890 --> 02:11:06.091
FIRST NOW BLACK WOMEN ARE

02:11:06.158 --> 02:11:09.127
STARTING TO MOVE UP. AND THEN

02:11:09.194 --> 02:11:11.463
AND THEN OBVIOUSLY ELIMINATE

02:11:11.530 --> 02:11:13.332
WHATEVER THOSE WHO DOES DOES

02:11:13.398 --> 02:11:15.033
PREJUDICIAL BARRIERS TO KEEP

02:11:15.100 --> 02:11:17.269
CERTAIN GROUPS DOWN THE THIRD

02:11:17.336 --> 02:11:18.704
RISING HAVE LISTED TRYING TO

02:11:18.770 --> 02:11:19.972
GET EVERYBODY TO RISE A ONE

02:11:20.038 --> 02:11:23.141
TIME THEY PICK AND CHOOSE. WHO

02:11:23.208 --> 02:11:24.810
THEY WANT TO RISE AT A CERTAIN

02:11:24.876 --> 02:11:28.780
TIME BUT ALWAYS KEEP A CERTAIN

02:11:28.847 --> 02:11:32.384
SEGMENT. DOWN OR PUSH THEM DOWN

02:11:32.451 --> 02:11:34.653
AND SO. I THINK THERE MAY BE

02:11:34.720 --> 02:11:37.656
SOME VALUABLE LESSONS. THAT AND

02:11:37.723 --> 02:11:39.191
I'VE ALWAYS SUGGESTED THAT WE

02:11:39.258 --> 02:11:42.494
STARTED LOOK AT HOWLAND. AFTER

02:11:42.561 --> 02:11:43.495
MEREKA WOMEN HAVE BECOME

02:11:43.562 --> 02:11:46.098
EXTREMELY POWERFUL WHETHER

02:11:46.164 --> 02:11:47.566
IT'S- STACEY ABRAMS TADESE

02:11:47.633 --> 02:11:49.768
HOLLY MITCHELL TO THE WEST WE

02:11:49.835 --> 02:11:51.903
HAVE SOME. POWERFUL WOMEN AND

02:11:51.970 --> 02:11:56.375
EVEN WITH MY LATINA GROUP THAT

02:11:56.441 --> 02:11:57.009
ADVISES ME ON WHAT I NEED TO DO

02:11:57.075 --> 02:12:02.714
EVERY DAY. SOME OF SITTING HERE-

02:12:02.781 --> 02:12:04.316
THEY WOULD SAY YOU KNOW AFTER

02:12:04.383 --> 02:12:05.917
AMERICANS YOU GUYS ARE REALLY

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:07.452
FORCEFUL WAY MAYBE CUT BECAUSE

02:12:07.519 --> 02:12:10.822
OUR WOMEN. ARE REALLY STRONG

02:12:10.889 --> 02:12:11.923
AND FORCEFUL AND THEY'RE

02:12:11.990 --> 02:12:13.825
LEADING THE WAY A LOT OF WAYS.

PARTNER. I MEAN TO BE HONEST WE

02:13:48.220 --> 02:13:48.954
SHOULD LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED IN

02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:50.455
SAN DIEGO DURING THE PANDEMIC

02:13:50.522 --> 02:13:51.490
AND I THINK I MADE SOME OF MY

02:13:51.556 --> 02:13:53.458
COLLEAGUES JEALOUS BECAUSE WE

02:13:53.525 --> 02:13:56.495
HAD A UNIQUE SITUATION WE HAD-

02:13:56.561 --> 02:13:58.497
JUST A NEWLY ELECTED LIKING A

02:13:58.563 --> 02:14:01.566
SUPERVISOR FOR THE FIRST TIME-

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:04.603
AND- WE- HADN'T. AT THE TIME

02:14:04.669 --> 02:14:06.605
THE CHAIR LATINO CAUCUS WHO-

02:14:06.671 --> 02:14:08.140
HAPPEN TO SLEEP WITH THE BOARD

02:14:08.206 --> 02:14:09.975
OF SUPERVISORS CHAIR. SO HE GOT

02:14:10.041 --> 02:14:11.843
HERE AND EVERY DAY. BUT IT WAS

02:14:11.910 --> 02:14:13.512
THAT INTENTIONALITY I YOU KNOW

02:14:13.578 --> 02:14:14.679
EARLY ON WE THOUGHT WITH THE

02:14:14.746 --> 02:14:16.081
TESTING SO WE STARTED SAYING ON

02:14:16.148 --> 02:14:17.849
THE VACCINES LIKE IT CAN'T JUST

02:14:17.916 --> 02:14:20.685
BE. ONE SIZE FITS ALL THERE HAS

02:14:20.752 --> 02:14:22.554
TO BE A DIRECTIVE- FOR THE

02:14:22.621 --> 02:14:25.457
SOUTH BAY. AND I'M IN ACTUALLY

02:14:25.524 --> 02:14:26.525
I'D LOVE TO SEE THE DATA I

02:14:26.591 --> 02:14:27.459
THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE NEED

02:14:27.526 --> 02:14:29.161
EXPLORER. BECAUSE WE WERE

02:14:29.227 --> 02:14:30.662
HOUSED IN THE SOUTH BAY WE

02:14:30.729 --> 02:14:32.464
REALLY DID A GOOD JOB IN THE

02:14:32.531 --> 02:14:34.599
SOUTH BAY OF- AND PRESSURING

02:14:34.666 --> 02:14:36.468
THE COUNTY BOARD. TO TAKE CARE

02:14:36.535 --> 02:14:39.070
OF OUR FOLKS IN TO BE DELIVERED

02:14:39.137 --> 02:14:40.038
THAT WE HAVE THAT SOME OF HIGH

02:14:40.105 --> 02:14:41.773
SPEC SEEN RATES IN FACT WE'RE

02:14:41.840 --> 02:14:45.177
WE'RE- BASICALLY FOR ELIGIBLE-

02:14:45.243 --> 02:14:47.512
ADULTS IN IN THE SOUTH BAY

02:14:47.579 --> 02:14:50.248
SOUTH OF THE- NINETY FOUR.

02:14:50.315 --> 02:14:52.050
WE'RE ALMOST AS CLOSE AS YOU

02:14:52.117 --> 02:14:53.685
CAN GET A 100% VACCINATED

02:14:53.752 --> 02:14:55.754
BASICALLY- AND THAT'S BECAUSE

02:14:55.821 --> 02:14:57.255
IT WAS INTENTIONAL AND WE

02:14:57.322 --> 02:14:59.458
WORKED SO HARD ON THAT. BUT IT

02:14:59.524 --> 02:15:00.425
WOULD BE INTERESTING EVEN TO

02:15:00.492 --> 02:15:01.793
SEE WHAT HAPPENED IN NORTH

02:15:01.860 --> 02:15:03.361
COUNTY WHERE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE

02:15:03.428 --> 02:15:06.698
REPRESENTATION NECESSARILY AND

02:15:06.765 --> 02:15:08.900
WE TRIED I MEAN I- YOU KNOW YOU

02:15:08.967 --> 02:15:10.335
YOU TEND TO FOCUS ON WHERE YOU

02:15:10.402 --> 02:15:12.537
LIVE- IN AND- HAVING.

02:15:12.604 --> 02:15:13.705
ORIGINALLY COME FROM THE NORTH

02:15:13.772 --> 02:15:15.140
CAN WILL WORK WITH TOUCH AND

02:15:15.207 --> 02:15:15.740
TRY TO GET SOME THINGS BUT WE

02:15:15.807 --> 02:15:17.843
WERE A LITTLE DELAYED- AND SO

02:15:17.909 --> 02:15:19.377
IT'S INTERESTING HOW IMPORTANT

02:15:19.444 --> 02:15:20.679
REPRESENTATION IS OUR

02:15:20.745 --> 02:15:21.480
RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUR

02:15:21.546 --> 02:15:22.280
COMMUNITY CLINICS OUR

02:15:22.347 --> 02:15:25.083
RELATIONSHIPS WITH. OUR NGOS-

02:15:25.150 --> 02:15:26.518
BUT I'M I'M REALLY PROUD OF

02:15:26.585 --> 02:15:28.353
WHAT WE WERE ABLE TO DEAL- BUT

02:15:28.420 --> 02:15:29.254
IT'SNOT ENOUGH AND WE CAN'T

02:15:29.321 --> 02:15:32.023
STOP SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE

02:15:32.090 --> 02:15:34.025
WORDS THAT ALWAYS COME OUT- THE

02:15:34.092 --> 02:15:36.461
INTENTIONALITY. UNAPOLOGETIC

02:15:36.528 --> 02:15:38.730
I'M REPRESENTATION BY LATINOS.

02:15:38.797 --> 02:15:40.765
WE NEED FOR THOSE WHO DON'T

02:15:40.832 --> 02:15:42.934
KNOW I THINK. I THINK CRISTINA

02:15:43.001 --> 02:15:44.569
GARCIA AND SOME OTHERS ALLUDED

02:15:44.636 --> 02:15:46.571
TO IT WE RIGHT WHEN I STARTED

02:15:46.638 --> 02:15:47.939
LEGISLATURE WE HAVE FIVE

02:15:48.006 --> 02:15:51.009
LATINOS IN BOTH HOUSES. AND WE

02:15:51.076 --> 02:15:54.112
DID START TO- AND THEN WE LOST

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:55.180
TWO AND WE START TO WORRY WHAT

02:15:55.247 --> 02:15:56.515
IS GONNA HAPPEN I MEAN HERE WE

02:15:56.581 --> 02:15:57.649
WERE THE LARGEST DEMOGRAPHIC

02:15:57.716 --> 02:16:00.085
CALIFORNIA. AND WE WERE- YOU

02:16:00.151 --> 02:16:01.486
KNOW LESS THAN 2% OF

02:16:01.553 --> 02:16:03.955
LEGISLATORS. AND WE MADE THE

02:16:04.022 --> 02:16:06.124
INTENTIONAL DECISION TO ASK OUR

02:16:06.191 --> 02:16:07.692
MALE COLLEAGUES LATINO MALE

02:16:07.759 --> 02:16:08.793
COLLEAGUES TO REPLACE

02:16:08.860 --> 02:16:10.929
THEMSELVES WITH A LATINA- AND

02:16:10.996 --> 02:16:13.331
OVER THE YEARS THE- GOOD LORD

02:16:13.398 --> 02:16:14.799
NINE YEARS WE'VE BEENTHERE-

02:16:14.866 --> 02:16:16.368
LEVINE IS NOW OUT NUMBER LET

02:16:16.434 --> 02:16:17.335
THE NOTE IN THE LEGISLATURE

02:16:17.402 --> 02:16:19.204
CLOSE TO TWENTY SO WE'RE- WE'RE

02:16:19.271 --> 02:16:21.306
NOT YET. AT OUR REPRESENTATIVE

02:16:21.373 --> 02:16:23.475
PROPORTION BUT DEFINITELY HAVE

02:16:23.542 --> 02:16:25.243
MADE A HUGE DENT. WITHOUT

02:16:25.310 --> 02:16:27.412
BECAME BECAUSE EVERY SINGLE DAY

02:16:27.479 --> 02:16:28.947
WE BEAT THE DRUM EVERY SINGLE

02:16:29.014 --> 02:16:31.082
DAY WE SAID WE HAVE TO ELECT

02:16:31.149 --> 02:16:32.050
LATINAS WE HAVE TO LET LEVINE

02:16:32.117 --> 02:16:36.488
AS- AND- IT. IT S. RUFFLES

02:16:36.555 --> 02:16:38.690
FEATHERS AND IT BOTHERS PEOPLE

02:16:38.757 --> 02:16:40.292
BUT THAT'S I THINK WHAT THIS

02:16:40.358 --> 02:16:41.660
COMMITTEE IS ABOUT IT'S ABOUT

02:16:41.726 --> 02:16:43.728
SEEN AT THIS EVERY DAY. AND

02:16:43.795 --> 02:16:44.663
THAT'S SOMETHING WE HAVE

02:16:44.729 --> 02:16:45.397
LEARNED FROM OUR AFRICAN

02:16:45.463 --> 02:16:47.265
AMERICAN SISTERS IS- THIS

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:50.335
UNAPOLOGETIC. QUESTS TO ENSURE.

02:16:50.402 --> 02:16:53.138
THAT LATINAS DON'T GO UNSEEN-

02:16:53.204 --> 02:16:54.673
