FREEWAY WIDENING AND EXPANSION PROJECTS QUITE ACQUISITION OF REAL PROPERTY LEADING TO THE DISPLACEMENT OF PRECEDENCE.

ALL MY TO FOUR EIGHT EIGHTY SEVEN SOME EIGHT ME LIKE FOR AND I. WOULD LOVE. TO PLAY AND ANOTHER. THANK YOU. YOU WILL HAVE TWO MINUTES APIECE RECCO THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAIR REPRESENTING TRANSPORTATION CALIFORNIA THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS A PEOPLE WHO BUILD REPAIR- THIS STATE HIGHWAY SYSTEM- FIRST I'D LIKE TO START BY CANNELLA JIM THAT WE ENJOYED A VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATION WITH THE AUTHOR'S. OFFICE AND STAFF A WEEK AND A HALF AGO AND THAT LED US TO TAKE OF OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION RATHER THAN AN OUTRIGHT OPPOSE SO IS BENEFICIAL FOR THEM AND BENEFICIAL FOR US. WE ORIGINALLY FOUND THE MEASURE TO BE VERY RESTRICTIVE AND BELIEVE THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY LOCK UP THE ENTIRE CORRIDORS WITHIN THE STATE THAT ARE BENEFICIAL ROUTES FOR MOVING PEOPLE AND GOODS- HOWEVER WE ALSO FOR FULLY BEHIND THE- THE GENESIS OF THE BILL. SAID WHICH IS A STRONG DESIRE TO PROVIDE RELIEF TO COMMUNITY COMMUNITIES EXPERIENCING CALIFORNIA'S WORST AIR QUALITY. AND FREQUENTLY LOCATED NEAR HIGHWAYS AND ROADWAYS THAT- THE STATE IS IMPLEMENTED. BUT AS WE DISCUSSED WITH THE OFFICE STAFF WE SUGGEST THAT THE BILL BE AMENDED TO ELIMINATE THE DIRECT TIÃžN TO THE INDEX. AS WE FIND THAT ELEMENT TO BE INAPPROPRIATE THE STATE IT'S CRITICAL FUNDING AND STAFFING- DECISIONS ON METHODOLOGIES OF A THIRD PARTY ENTITY. AND THAT THOSE POSH THOSE- METHODOLOGIES COULD CHANGE OVER TIME. WITHOUT MUCH PUBLIC INPUT AND IT'S OF CONCERN TO US SECONDLY WE ALSO FIND THE STATUTORY THRESHOLD LIMIT BUILT IN. FOR THE CONSULT CONSULTATION THE THIRTY PERCENTILE STANDARD. THERE'S ALWAYS GOING TO BE. 50% BELOW THE FIFTIETH PERCENTILE NO MATTER WHAT THE UNDERLYING NUMBERS ARE IN FACTORS ARE SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT IT BUT NEVERTHELESS WE ARE OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AND WOULD LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING. CLOSELY WITH- THE AUTHORS OFFICE IF THE BILL PASSES OUT OF COMMITTEE. THANK YOU NECKLACE PLEASE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND PADAM SHARON MEMBERS I'M WHERE A TOP. HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND REGRETTABLY WE TOO ARE HERE IN OPPOSITION. I'M WE ARE SENSITIVE AND APPRECIATE THE- THE REASON BEHIND THE BILL AND- WE JUST THINK THAT THE BILL AS IT'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED IS FAR TOO BROAD IT IS RESTRICTIVE. I'M ALSO FELL COUNTIES INCLUDING OURS WHEN WE WENT TO THE VOTERS TO ASK- ARE VOTERS TO. PAY AN EXTRA HALF CENT SALES TAX TO FUND TRANSPORTATION INVESTMENTS. WE DID SO BY GIVING THEM A LIST OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET FUNDED. I'M WE HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO FILL THE TOOK TO FINISH THOSE PROJECTS WE'RE WORKING OUR WAY THROUGH THAT LIST OF PROJECTS RIGHT NOW. BUT THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT US FROM COMPLETING THAT LIST SOME OF THOSE PROJECTS DO FALL WITHIN THE DEFINITION THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE BILL. SO WE NEED CAUGHT BETWIXT AND BETWEEN BETWEEN TWO LAWS WE HAVE A AN ABSOLUTELY L'APPLICATION TO- TO FINISH THE PROJECTS THAT WE TOLD THE VOTERS WE WOULD. AND YET THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT US UNFORTUNATELY FROM DOING THAT. AND THEN- L. O. WE DO THINK THE BILL IS PARTICULARLY BROAD. WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN THE IN THE- PRODUCTION PHASE IN THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE. TRANSPORTATION PROJECTS TAKE A VERY LONG TIME TO- TO BRING TO TH TO FRUITION. THE BILL DOESN'T DISCUSS WHAT WOULD HAPPEN TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN DEVELOPMENT AND SO WE COULD HOLD THE PROJECT MIDWAY. WE DON'T THINK THAT MAKES SENSE AND LASTLY WOULD SAY SOME OF THE THESE PROJECTS THAT WE'RE WORKING ON EVEN ON THE HIGHWAY SYSTEM ARE CONSISTENT WITH OUR OUR SCS. THEY COULD BE DONE IN WITH- THE PURPOSE OF. HOW A MEDICARE- CONGESTION MITIGATION. BUT ACTUALLY WOULD HELP SOME OF THOSE AND SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT SURROUND. ON THE PROJECTS AND SO AGAIN WE THINK IT'S OVERLY BROAD WE REALLY DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR OF THE BILL MOVES FORWARD BUT AT THIS POINT. WITH THE BILL AS DRAFTED WE ARE IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU MODEL YOU STAY THERE IN CASES QUESTIONS FOR YOU LATER. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO IT THIS WAY WE'RE GOING TO FIRST HAVE ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WHO IS. IN FAVOR IN SUPPORT OF THE LEGISLATION TO COME UP TO THE MIKE.

THE KALRA THANK MANAGER AND THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR- AND- I DEFINITELY AM. WILL THE INTENTION IS A VERY POSITIVE ONE- BUT THIS LEGISLATION- AND I THINK THAT EVEN LISTENING TO THE OPPOSITION THAT THERE'S BEEN MOVEMENT AND- BASED UPON THE FACT THAT CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING THERE'S BEEN MOVEMENT IN THE POSITIVE DIRECTION- WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS TODAY AND HOPE THAT THE CONVERSATIONS CONTINUE BOTH WITH THE OPPOSITION AT THE DESK AS WELL AS THOSE THAT- SPOKE HERE TODAY. THANK YOU. MR FONG. MY QUESTION IS THE AUTHOR BUT MAYBE THE- THE OPPONENTS CAN ALSO- CHIME IN TOO BUT- MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL IS THAT. IT WOULD POTENTIALLY MAKE CONGESTION WORSE THIS BILL WOULD BAN PROJECTS- THAT ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND CONGESTED CORRIDORS. AND SO A LOT OF THE PROJECTS THAT ARE SLATED FOR CONSTRUCTION THAT ARE ALREADY UNDERWAY OR THAT ARE GOING THROUGH THE REVIEW PROCESS THIS BILL- AT THE WAY I READ IT. WOULD WOULD HAVE THESE PROJECTS STOP AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO. ENCOURAGE GOOD MOVEMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLY CHAIN CHALLENGES EVERYTHING ELSE- WE ALSO NEED TO BE INVESTING IN IN CRITICAL FREIGHT CORRIDORS WHICH A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS ARE INTO SO HOW HOW WHAT IS YOUR- WHAT IS YOUR RESPONSE. TO THAT. THANK YOU I ACTUALLY LIVE OFF OF ONE OF THOSE GOODS MOVEMENT ALTHOUGH THAT'S COMING INTO THE PORT OF LONG BEACH AND LA AND UP ON THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY AND READ THROUGH MY DISTRICT EITHER THE SEVEN TEN TO THE RAILYARD. OR AT THE SIX OH FIVE. ON AND ALL THE OTHER FREE WITH A THICK SIDE. ARE IN SO A GREAT WAY TO HELP IS TO GET US OUT OF OUR CARS AND INVEST IN PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION WE HAVE. A GOAL LINE IN THE AREA WE HAVE AN ORANGE LAND AREA ALL THAT WERE INITIALLY SLATED TO BE COMPLETED IN TWENTY FIFTY EIGHT. COMMUNITY HAS BEEN PUSHING HARD TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN IN THIS COUNTRY AND I THINK WE'RE GOING TO GET THERE. ARE OUT THERE TO HELP THOSE GOODS MOVEMENTS MOVE I WANT THEM TO MOVE ALSO THERE ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR- ECONOMY. AS WE HAVE BEEN WORKING ON PROJECTS WE HAVE MORE RESEARCH AND MORE DATA SHOWING US THAT SOMETIMES WHAT WE THINK WE ARE HELPING WITH CONGESTION WERE ACTUALLY DOING THE OPPOSITE. AND SO I THINK FOR MYSELF IT'S TAKING WHAT WE'VE LEARNED THANK IN OUR COMMITMENT TO EQUITY AND HOW TO RETHINK THIS IT BY NO MEANS I TRY TO PRETEND THAT THIS BILL IS PERFECT. BUT AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK TO THE OPPOSITION IS HOW DO WE CREATE SOMETHING BETTER I THINK AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE ALL COMMITTED TO SOMETHING THAT'S MORE EQUITABLE ARE MOLD MORE JUST THE ONLY PIECE I DID ON THE- FROM THE OPPOSITE. IS ABLE. THIS A HOUSING KILLER WHEN DISPLACING FOR EXAMPLE. TWO THOUSAND FAMILIES ON THE SEVENTEEN PREVIOUS SOUNDS LIKE A LITTLE BIT MORE OF A HEALTHY COLOR TO ME. OTHERWISE I'LL BUT I AM COMMITTED TO FINDING IN THAT SPOT IF THERE ARE PROJECTS THAT. ARE NEEDED FOR SAFETY. WE'RE NOT TRYING TO GET IN THE MIDDLE OF THOSE. I THINK SOME OF THE SENSORS THAT HAVE. BEEN BROUGHT UP THERE IS A PATH. WAY FORWARD BUT I THINK THE REALITY IS THAT SOME DECISIONS WERE MADE TWENTY YEARS AGO. THEY NOT REALLY. TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION ALL THAT WE'VE LEARNED IN THE TWENTY YEARS AND WE NEED EVERYTHING SOME OF THOSE IDEAS AND WE'RE STARTING TO IN PLACES. WANT TO MAKE SURE WE'RE DOING THAT CONSISTENTLY ACROSS THE STATE NOT JUST IN SOME POCKETS. NO I'M SORRY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI I USED TO KNOW HOW TO DO THIS- I THINK. FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE AND THAT'S WHY WE WERE GRATEFUL TO THE AUTHOR STAFF TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION BECAUSE- WE THINK. SEEK WHAT NEPA IDENTIFIES AND HAS CONSULTATION PROCESSES AND COMES UP WITH MITIGATION PROGRAMS. THAT AVOID CONFLICTS THAT ARE AVOIDABLE. AND WE THINK THAT'S MUCH MORE PREFERABLE THAN HANGING- PROJECTS FUTURE ON A- ON AN INDEX. THAT COULD CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING UPON WHETHER DEPENDING UPON. MEASUREMENTS AND OTHER. OTHER THINGS SO WE'RE SATISFIED WITH THE WAY. THE PROCESS WORKS NOW- SOMETIMES WE'D LIKE TO SEIZE THE BIT MORE STREAMLINING IN IN THE SEQUEL AREA BUT- THIS. PURPOSE I THINK WE THINK IT'S SET UP TO DO EXACTLY WHAT. I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO DO WHICH IS IDENTIFIED THOSE. ISSUES NEED TO BE MITIGATED TO AVOID THE IMPACTS ON THE LOCAL COMMUNITIES OF. THAT'S ALL I HAVE AT THIS POINT THANK YOU. THANK YOU TO DO MR FONG I WULD I WOULD JUST LOVE IT MAYBE I'LL JUST CONCLUDE BY SAYING THAT- YOU KNOW WITH WITH TRAFFIC CONGESTION AND WITH BOTTLENECKS- YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE INVESTING MORE RESOURCES. INTO ADDRESSING THOSE THOSE- THOSE CHALLENGES IN THOSE IMPACTS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE EFFICIENT FLOW AND THAT WE DON'T HAVE BOTTLENECKS AND CONGESTION- AND I'M MY I'M AFRAID THAT THIS BILL WOULD ACTUALLY PROHIBITS IT FUNDING. AND SO FOR THAT REASON I CAN'T SUPPORT TODAY. I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO ADDRESS CONGESTION AT THIS AND ALWAYS HAVE TO BE A FREEWAY EXPANSION YOU KNOW I THINK EXPLAINED THAT INCLUDING GETTING. INDIVIDUALS OUT OF OUR CARS. I IS THE WAY WE SAW IT DURING THE PANDEMIC WHO ARE NOT DRIVING OUR CARS AND THE STRIKES WERE FLOWING AT RECORD. RECORD NUMBER OF TRUCKS OR LEAVING THE PORT AND FLOWING TO THE SEVEN TEMPE WAY INTO. IT REGARDING COMMERCE. OUT THERE AND SO THERE ARE THINGS LOTS OF OTHER WAYS THAT WE CAN BEST DOLLARS. THAT MIGHT MAKE MORE SENSE THAT ALLOW THE EFFICIENT MOVE OF BUSINESSMEN'S. I WANT THAT EFFICIENT MOVE A GOOD MOVEMENT THAT MEANS CLEANER AIR FOR ME WE'RE NOT JUST SITTING AROUND SECOND TRAFFIC IDOLING. AT THE OTHER DAY 75% OF MY AIR POLLUTION ISSUES IN MY BACKYARD ARE BECAUSE OF ALL THE TRUCKS THAT OFTENTIMES ARE. I DON'T THINK. I'M GETTING US OUT OF OUT OF THEIR WAY IT'S HELPFUL. THANK YOU- JUST KIND OF WANT TO JUMP ON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER. COMMENTS THERE. I SAT ON- ORANGE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION AUTHORITY AND DURING MY TIME WE OBVIOUSLY APPROVED A LOT OF PROJECTS IN THESE PROJECTS DON'T JUST HAPPEN THEY TAKE FIVE YEARS SOMETIMES TEN YEARS. SO MIKE ONE OF MY QUESTIONS AS- WHAT ABOUT THESE PROJECTS THAT ARE READY. YOU KNOW. ON ON THE BOOKS BUT THEY HAVEN'T STARTED EVER BROKEN GROUND. WHAT GOES WHAT HAPPENS TO THEM AND THEN ALSO IT COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND WHERE. YOU KNOW WHERE YOU'RE LIVING. BUT ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL. IT'S SUCH IN THE STATE OF MY DISTRICT THAT I REPRESENT. WE JUST WE DON'T REALLY HAVE AREA OF THEIR FOR. FOR TRANSIT FOR RAIL- IT IT. IS JUST NOT MADE UP THERE LIKE IT IS IN THE BIGGER CITIES LIKE THAT SO. I UNDERSTAND. THIS WOULD PROBABLY BE A GOOD PROJECT FOR WHERE YOU'RE LIVING BUT IT'S NOT ALWAYS THAT FOR EVERYONE ELSE SO. I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S WAYS OF MAKING THIS WHERE IT'S BASICALLY. A REGIONAL OR ITS YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE IF YOU'RE A VERY WANTS TO. YOU KNOW DO THAT THEY CAN DO IT BUT NOT PUTTING ACROSS THE STATE BECAUSE THAT'S- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN. WE DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT IT'S NOT ALWAYS GREAT FOR EVERYBODY. BUT I THINK WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PROJECTS THAT ALREADY BEEN APPROVED. AND FUNDED. I WOULD SAY THAT WE ARE IF I. IF INITIALLY THERE WAS A DEBT TO STOP ALL THREE WEEK CONSTRUCTIONS AND I THINK. TO BE SENSITIVE TO BECAME. OR THOUGHTFUL AND MINDFUL CREATING A PROCESS WHICH IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THIS BILL INTO WERE OPEN TO.CONTINUING THOSE DISCUSSIONS WITH. THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO. KEEP MOVING AND THE PRICE DIRECTION. TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE EVERYBODY ACROSS THE BOARD. AND WE'RE NOT THE REALITY IS THAT IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA AND THE HISTORY. THESE FREEWAYS HAVE DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. THOSE ARE THE COMMUNITIES ON TRYING TO PROTECT AND IF WE COULD CRAFT TOGETHER. I WANT TO BE THE STAKEHOLDERS IN SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION I THINK WE HAVE THAT SIMILAR COMMITMENT. HAVE TOGETHER AMENDMENTS COME OPEN TO THAT AT THIS VERY MOMENT. I DON'T HAVE THAT I HAVE A COUPLE OF FOLKS WHO HAVE BEEN ENGAGING IN DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE TO THE OPPOSITION. THAT ALSO I'M EXCITED THAT THEY'RE OPEN TO US FOR YOU NOT THAT. THAT'S SWEET SPOT AND SO I WELCOME THEM TO TABLE I DON'T HAVE ALL THE ANSWERS FOR YOU. TODAY- WE WERE START IN SOME PLACE IN THE PROCESS AND- IF YOU LOOK AT MY- RECORD OF. TEN I TRIED TO GET TO THAT CONSENSUS I TRY TO FIND THAT. SWEET SPOT TO THAT WORLD WOULD YOU KNOW SOMETHING THAT WE ARE COMFORTABLE ENOUGH WITH. HI I APPRECIATE THAT AND I'LL- I'LL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT HAPPENS TO THAT'S MY CONCERN TWO GAME THERE'S A LOT OF PROJECTS HAVE BEEN FUNDED. THAT ARE SITTING THERE JUST READY TO GO FORWARD WHAT HAPPENS TO ALL OF THOSE AT THIS BILL PASSES DOWN THE LINE- THE SENATE- WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE PROJECTS ESPECIALLY A LOT OF THESE PROJECTS FOR OUR- DISTRICT. ARE FUNDED BY MEASURE M. TOO SO THERE'S TAXES THAT PEOPLE READY PAID. WHERE THEY GO SO. I THINK THAT'S GREAT I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU GUYS CAN DO. AND THIS ONLY LIMIT STATE. FUNDING ON THE STATE DOLLARS THIS ELIMINATE ANY OF YOUR- LOCAL TAX DOLLARS THAT YOU'RE VOTERS HAVE. APPROVED RIGHT BUT THOSE THOSE TAX DOLLARS WITH CHIANG FOR THE PROJECT. SO IF THEY CAN'T OF THE PROJECT. THERE GO THOSE TECHNOLOGIES SAID. I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW YOU GUYS WORK TOGETHER. THANK YOU. MISTER LEE. I SAW A THANKED THE OFFERING THE BILL FORWARD OUT. I'M SORRY THAT I MISSED YOUR POSITION BEGINNING BUT I THINK THIS IS AN EXCELLENT BILL. AND AS WE PRIORITIZE MOVING PEOPLE AND GOODS NOT JUST CARS THIS IS AN IMPORTANT STEP IN DOING THAT. OKAY A LOT OF DEVELOPED COUNTRIES IN THE WORLD ARE EQUAL PEERS OF POPULATION AND ECONOMY. THAT I PRIORITIZE. ALMOST TRANSITION OT JUST THE CAR SO I THINK THIS IS WORTH MOVING TOWARDS. AND I REALLY LIKE IT AND I KNOW I'VE GOT FAITH IN YOU THAT YOU WILL WORK WITH OPPOSITION TO FIGURE OUT THAT SWEET SPOT. WHERE IT IS BUT- I LIKE TO ADD MY NAME IS CO AUTHOR IF YOU SO. ARE ABLE TO DO SO THANK YOU. APPETITEGO THE DAILY THANK YOU WERE. I WANT TO FLUSH OUT A LITTLE BIT WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE- DETAILS YOU'D LIKE TO. OBTAIN THROUGH YOUR PROPOSAL. VERSES THE EXISTING SYKORA. MECHANISM WHAT WHAT ADDITIONAL WHAT REALLY IS THE DIFFERENCE I WOULD SAY THAT BY LEAVING EXAMPLE WHEN YOU CAN DISPLACE A THOUSAND LOW INCOME FAMILIES ALONG THE SEVEN TEN FREEWAY- WE HAVE A PROBLEM THE TO HEALTH IN A SECURE AREA WE KNOW THAT THAT MORE TRAFFIC JUST BEFORE POLLUTION ALSO AND SO THE SYSTEM IS FAILING THEM WOULDN'T. BUT WOULDN'T THAT. EXAMPLE BE COVERED UNDER SEQUEL NO BECAUSE YOU COULD ACTUALLY MITIGATE. ANYWHERE IN THE WORLD WITH ENOUGH TO BE IN THAT BACKYARD THAT YOU ARE IN THAT COMMUNITY THAT YOU ARE AFFECTING THE HAVE A SEPARATE BILL FOR THAT IF THAT WERE TO PASS MAYBE IT WOULD BE COVERED SO YOU'RE YOU. YOU REALLY. DON'T WANT ANYONE. TO EVER BE DISPLACED UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES I DON'T WALLOW FOR A COMMUNITY FOR A FREEWAY WIDENING RICH POOR WHITE PEOPLE OF COLOR YOU DON'T WANT AYONE DISPLACED NO THIS BILL SPECIFICALLY TRYING TO FOCUS ON LOW INCOME DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IT'S NOT TRYING TO SAY EVERYBODY WE ARE PRIOR IT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT EQUITY AND PROTECTING THOSE COMMUNITIES. MY POINT IS. THOSE DETAILS. SHOULD BE COVERED UNDER THE SEQUEL PROCESS. NOT WHAT YOU CAN DO IT ANYWHERE ELSE THE MITIGATION FOR SECRET DOES NOT NEED TO HAPPEN IN THE COMMUNITY. THAT IS BEING AFFECTED. AND YOU DON'T WANT THAT. NOT NOT FOR NOT FOR LOW INCOME COMMUNITY THAT'S ALREADY NOT FOR A COMMUNITY THAT HAS EXTRADITION THE GENERATION AFTER GENERATION TOLD. THAT THEY ARE SACRIFICING FOR EVERYONE ELSE THIS PROGRESS THAT'S WHAT CONTENTLY HAPPENS AND IF YOU LOOK AT THE DATA TO COMMUNITIES OF COLOR IS LOOKING COMMUNITIES THAT IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. I KEEP GETTING TOLD. THEY ARE AN AFTERTHOUGHT AND SO IF I. AM ALL I'M SAYING IS THAT THEY SHOULD NOT BE AN AFTER THOUGHT HE WE'RE GOING TO BE WITH EQUITY. WE SHOULD BE PUTTING THAT AT THE FOREFRONT. IT WOULD BE HELPFUL TO HAVE SOME SPECIFICS ABOUT THOSE VERY FOLKS WHO WERE PROMISED SOMETHING. AND THEN THE PROMISE WAS RENEGED I DON'T KNOW THAT THEY WERE PROMISED ANYTHING- A LOT OF TIMES THEY GET A MINUTE THE MAIN PUSHED OUT OR OTHER WAYS AND THEN DONNA CERTAINLY END UP AND HOW THEME OR END UP IN A BETTER SITUATION. ALL RIGHT THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYBODY ELSE. WELL I WANT TO COMMEND THE AUTHOR FOR HER YEARS OF WORK ON AIR QUALITY ISSUES IN EQUITY ISSUES AND THERE'S BEEN A CERTAINLY A LOT OF DISCUSSION ABOUT THE IMPACTS OF THESE LARGE FREEWAY PROJECTS ON LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES- OVER THE YEARS AND CERTAINLY- PUTTING AN EQUITY LENS ON THAT IT'S SOMETHING THAT'S LONG OVERDUE AND CERTAINLY SEE QUITE NEED A NEARBY HAVE NOT DONE NEARLY ENOUGH IN THE PAST TWO. I TAKE THESE IMPACTS INTO ACCOUNT AND THE OUR HIGHWAY NETWORK AND WHERE ARE LARGE HIGHWAYS HAVE BEEN PUT DEFINITELY SHOWS THAT I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MS TOP BECAUSE SOMETHING THAT YOU SAID- INTERESTED ME AND I'M JUST CURIOUS SO WHEN YOU PUT PROJECTS IN FRONT OF THE VOTERS LIKE YOU DID IN ORANGE COUNTY WHAT EXACTLY DOES THAT LOOK LIKE SO IF I GET MY BALLOT IN THE MAIL DOES THAT MEAN THAT NEXT TO THAT PARTICULAR. ITEM THERE'S A LAUNDRY LIST OF PROJECTS AND SO WHEN I VTE FOR IT I SEE EVERY SINGLE PROJECT EVERY INTERCHANGE EVERY ROAD THAT IS GOING TO BE FUNDED BY THAT I'M TALKING TO FOR A LITTLE BIT TO MY COLLEAGUE HERE MR WATCH BUT- BUT BUT THE SHORT ANSWER IS YES THOSE PROJECTS ARE INGRAINED WITHIN THE BALLOT INITIATIVE BUT IF I DON'T YOU THINK IT ON THE BALLOT AND I'LL LEAVE IT IS SO WHERE WOULD SOMEBODY SO SOMEBODY WOULD HAVE TO WHAT GO AND LOOK ON WEBSITES SOMEWHERE AND LOOK AT THAT. SO YOU'RE YES SO WHEN THEY OPEN THE BALLOT IN THEIR VOTING. MY GUESS IS IT SAYS LIKE. MONEY TO HELP WITH. CONGESTION OR TRANSPORTATION ORANGE COUNTY. I BELIEVE THEY ARE DONE BY POTS OF MONEY TYPE TYPES OF PROJECTS- BUT THE INDIVIDUAL PROJECTS WOULD HAVE TO BE IDENTIFIED ELSEWHERE. AND AS OF SIGNIFICANT COMMUNITY OUTREACH- EFFORT IS MADE IN THAT PROCESS AND SO THOSE ARE READILY OF IT THOUGH THE LISTS ARE READILY AVAILABLE. I MEAN I THINK IT'S A REQUIREMENT THAT AND HOW MUCH TIME HAVE TO HOSE I BY WHEN YOU GO BACK TO THE VOTERS AND CHECK WITH THEM TO SE IF. SINCE TEN YEARS HAS GONE BY AND THINGS HAVE CHANGED THAT THEY STILL WANT THOSE EXACT SAME PROJECTS FUNDED. WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO CHANGE THAT LIST THAT IS WHAT ONCE IT'S BEEN ADOPTED BY THE VOTERS THAT IS WHAT THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS ARE. ALSO WE HAVE BONDED AGAINST THOSE DOLLARS AND SO WE HAVE OBLIGATIONS WITH- WITH BOND HOLDERS ON THOSE PROJECTS AS WELL. FOR THE VERY SPECIFIC PROJECT FOR INSTANCE HE- LANE ADDING ON A HIGHWAY OR IS IT MORE OPEN ENDED THAN THAT CONGESTION RELIEF FOR INSTANCE I SHOULD PROBABLY GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT I DON'T KNOW SPECIFICALLY HOW IDENTIFIED TO THE BOND HOUSE OKAY YEAH I'D BE CURIOUS. TO FIND THAT OUT AS I'M LEARNING. THIS ROLE SO THANK YOU TIME WHEN WE THOUGHT THAT IF THERE WAS A FREEWAY THAT WAS CONGESTED IF WE WOULD JUST ADD A LANE ALL OF A SUDDEN IT WOULD- INCREASING THE FLOW ABILITY OF THE TRAFFIC CAN DECREASE CONGESTION AND WHAT WE'VE SEEN OVER AND OVER AGAIN IS THAT THAT'S USUALLY NOT THE CASE THAT INSTEAD WHEN YOU HAD THE CAPACITY TO. GET MORE DRIVERS AND YOU GET YOU INVITE MORE DRIVERS ON THE ROAD IN THE ROAD BECOMES JUST AS IF NOT MORE CONGESTED- AND WE SEE THE IMPACTS OF DOING EXACTLY THAT KIND OF WORK ON COMMUNITIES ON AIR QUALITY AND EVERYTHING ELSE. AND THE AUTHORS IS SPOT ON THAT THERE IS A BETTER WAY. AND IT'S A WAY THAT PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA HAVE SAID THAT THEY WANT WHICH IS MORE MOBILITY OPTIONS- AND LESS CONGESTION. SO I THINK THAT THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT TO WORK OUT AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD- YOU KNOW WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT CALTRANS CURRENT PROCESSES ARE FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE IS THEY'VE BEEN PIVOTING AS AN AGENCY. WE NEED TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENS HOW YOU COUNT PROJECTS THAT ARE EXPANDING BECAUSE THEY'RE ADDING TRANSIT. OR ADDING AN- OF A LANE FOR BUS RAPID TRANSIT. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE LEAVE ROOM FOR OF THE MARRIOTT OF VERY WELL INTENDED PROJECTS. THAT COULD INDEED HELP. A BUT I SUPPORT YOUR GOALS WITH US AND SO I'M GONNA SUPPORT MOVING FORWARD TODAY. AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE CONVERSATION CONTINUE THAT AND- I DO AGREE THAT WE NEED TO KEEP WORKING ON AND APPRECIATE. EVERYONE'S COMMITMENT TO COME TO THE TABLE AND FIGURE SOMETHING OUT AND I'M HOPEFUL ONCE I DO APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU- DO YOU HAVE A CLOSING STATEMENT OR IS THAT IT. I WILL BE BRIEF THAT THAT COULD BE. OKAY WE DON'T HAVE A QUORUM YET SO WE'LL TAKE THE BILL UP AS SOON AS WE HAVE ONE MORE MEMBER. THANK YOU BOTH THANK YOU SO MUCH.

AS YOU HEARD RENDON MENTION THIS BILL WOULD REAUTHORIZE CALIFORNIA'S MOST SUCCESSFUL CLEANER PROGRAMS THE CARL MOYER PROGRAM IN AB NINE TWENTY THREE LOCAL SORT OF ERROR PROGRAM. BOTH OF THESE ARE CRITICAL FOR HELPING CALIFORNIA'S CLEAN AIR GOALS AND COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS A CARL MOYER PROGRAM. THESE PROGRAMS ARE THE MOST SUCCESSFUL AIR EMISSIONS REDUCTIONS- INCENTIVE PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA AND THEY ARE THE MODEL BY WHICH OTHER REGIONS. A LOOK TO REDUCE EMISSIONS THROUGH INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. ARE THEY HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING EMISSIONS FOR ALMOST A QUARTER CENTURY AND THAT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN COST EFFECTIVE IN REDUCING MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS. AND BRENDAN ALSO MENTION THE MOBILE SOURCES THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OUR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT MARINE VESSELS. LOCOMOTIVES THUS CONTRIBUTE 280% OF THE EMISSIONS WITHIN THE SOUTH COAST BASIN. SO THAT MEANS SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILLION RESIDENTS THAT ARE LIVING WITHIN OUR REGION ARE BREATHING SOME OF THE MOST UNHEALTHY AIR ANYWHERE IN THE NATION. ESPECIALLY THOSE LIVING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN FACT THE SOUTH COAST IS HOME 267% OF ALL DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW THESE HARMFUL MOBILE SOURCE EMISSIONS EXACERBATE MANY HEALTH PROBLEMS INCLUDING ASTHMA ATTACKS. HEART DISEASE AND EVEN CERTAIN TYPES OF CANCER. THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO ASSIST IN THE PURCHASE OF CLEANER THAN REQUIRED ENGINE AND EQUIPMENT TECHNOLOGIES TO ACHIEVE EMISSION REDUCTIONS THAT ARE REAL SURPLUS QUANTIFIABLE AND ENFORCEABLE. OVERALL THESE PROGRAMS ARE WIDELY EMBRACED NOT ONLY BY THE BREATHING PUBLIC BUT ALSO BY INDUSTRY AND END USERS TRYING TO DO THE RIGHT THING AHEAD OF ANY REGULATIONS.

I'D LIKE TO BEGIN BY ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS WHICH WE DRAFTING COORDINATION WITH STAKEHOLDER INPUT AND COMMITTEE FEEDBACKS WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THIS BILL AB TWO TWO ZERO SIX WILL AID IN THE ENFORCEMENT OF CALIFORNIA'S PARKING CASH OUT PROGRAM WHICH HAS BEEN LW FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES PARKING CASH OUT PROGRAMS OR PCO FOR SHORT REQUIRE CERTAIN EMPLOYERS TO OFFER AN EQUAL BENEFITS EMPLOYEES WHO DO NOT DRIVE TO WORK AND THEREFORE DO NOT GET THE BENEFITS OF FREE SUBSIDIZED PARKING PROVIDE ABOUT EMPLOYER. THE PROGRAM CREATES MORE EQUITY TO THOSE WHO RIDE A BIKE OR TAKE PUBLIC TRANSIT TO WORK TO SUPPORT TRANSPORTATION METHODS THAT REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT PCO IS NOT BEING THE DIFFICULTY IN CALCULATING THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE PARKING MANY OWNERS OF COMMERCIAL REAL ESTATE BUNDLE THE COST OF PARKING WITH THE COST OF AN OFFICE SPACE INTO A SINGLE THESE PRICE THIS PRACTICE MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR EMPLOYERS TO SEPARATE THE COST OF PARKING SPACES. IN ORDER US IS CONCERNED AB TWENTY TWO OH SIX SIMPLY REQUIRES A PRICE A PARKING TO BE LISTED IN A COMMERCIAL LEASE IF THEY ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE PCO THE CITY OF SANTA MONICA IS ONE OF THE FEW JURISDICTIONS IN CALIFORNIA THE SUCCESSFUL PCO PROGRAM AND NOTES OF THE UNBUNDLING OF PARKING IS A USEFUL TOOL AND ITS IMPLEMENTATION THE CITY HAS ITS-OWN UNBUNDLE PARKING PROVISION TO MAKE IT EASIER TO IMPLEMENT THE PCO PROGRAM. AFTER CLASS YOUR SUPPORT TO HELP EASE THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PEACE YOUR PROGRAM AND TODAY I'LL BY PHONE I WILL BE JOINED BY ALAN GREENBERG- WAS EXPERT IN PARKING CASH OUT POLICY AND FROM DC WASHINGTON DC AND JOHN KASICH. WHO IS TRANSPORTATION POLICY MANAGER AT CBRE. THE YOU VERY MUCH OPERATE CAN YOU PLEASE FIND MISTER GREENBERG AYE MR KASS. WERE AB TWENTY TWO OH SIX.

HELLO OKAY THANK YOU- GOOD AFTERNOON EVERYONE I'M HONORED TO TESTIFIED TODAY IN STRONG SUPPORT OF ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY TWO A SIX MANY CALIFORNIA'S PARKING CASHEL TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE IMPLEMENTATION. I WORKED ON PARKING CASH OF FOR MANY YEARS MOST RECENTLY SUPPORTING PASSAGE OF WASHINGTON DC'S TWENTY TWENTY ORDINANCE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LEASE AMENDMENTS WOULD MAKE A HUGE IMPROVEMENT TO THE CALIFORNIA LAW AND WILL INCREASE ITS IMPACTS MANY FULL WITHOUT BEING BURDENSOME TO ANY PARTIES. WHEN ENACTED IN NINETEEN NINETY TWO CALIFORNIA'S LAW WAS CONSIDERED GROUNDBREAKING- IT REFLECTED AN UNDERSTANDING THAT THE SOCIAL ENGINEERING UNDERPINNING PRIVATE EMPLOYERS PICKING ONLY COMMUTER PARKING SUBSIDIZES COUNTRIES SO MANY STATE CALLS. AND WHILE IT WASN'T DESIGNED TO BE UNIVERSAL IT WAS DESIGNED TO APPLY TO EMPLOYERS- WHERE IT MATTERED MOST IN AIR QUALITY NON CONFORMING CONFORMANCE AREAS. AND FROM PLAYERS LARGE ENOUGH TO BE ABLE TO ADMINISTRATIVELY HANDLE THE SMALL BURDENS OF LEGISLATION. THE LAW THOUGH HAS HISCHALLENGES MOST ESPECIALLY THE- WHO THE VALUE OF CASH OUT IS LINK NOT TO THE MARKET VALUE BUT INSTEAD DUE OUT OF POCKET COSTS. AND THAT IS BEEN REALLY PROBLEMATIC SANTA MONICA FOR EXAMPLE WHICH IS WHAT THE STATE AND COMMUTER AND CASH AND- SO THAT THREE QUARTERS OF EMPLOYERS THAT SHOULD BE SUBJECT TO LAWS HURT THEMSELVES BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE OUT OF POCKET COSTS. FOR THE PARKING THEY ARE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES. AND EVEN LEASES PARKING OFTEN DO SO AT A MUCH REDUCED RATE AS AN INDUCEMENT FOR EMPLOYERS TO ENTER LEASES. WITH THE LEASING ENTITY. ASSEMBLY MEMBERS- LEASE AMENDMENTS WOULD MAKE CALIFORNIA CONSISTENT WASHINGTON DC'S ORGANS AND ALSO WITHOUT VIRUS VALLEYS PARKING. SPECIFICALLY THE IRS THE VALUE PARKING BASED ON AN ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTION. AND EXCLUDE ANY CONSIDERATION OF AN EMPLOYMENTRELATIONSHIP IN DETERMINING THE VALUE THE PARKING. AS AMENDED CALIFORNIA'S LAW WOULD CONTINUE TO ALLOW EMPLOYERS TO SET AND CHANGE BENEFITS TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. WITH ONE EXCEPTION AND THAT IS A COULD NOT SOLELY OFFER PARKING SUBSIDY TO THEIR EMPLOYEES. LANDLORDS AND BUILDING OWNERS ARE BURDENED BY NOTHING MORE THAN JUST HONESTLY VALUING. THE PARKING THAT THEY'RE MAKING AVAILABLE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER LISA RENAMED FAITH EVEN TENTATIVELY TO LAW BUT LIMITING ITS SCOPE TO DEAL ONLY WITH WELL UNDERSTOOD IMPLEMENTATION DIVISION DEFICIENCIES IN OUR IF YOU CAN FINISH UP PLEASE HERE YEAH.

THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE'LL GO TO THE COMMITTEE NOW. THE COMMITTEE MEMBER WISHING TO OPINE OR QUESTION. IF THANK YOU ON QUESTION FOR YOU. RIGHT NOW OBVIOUSLY WITH SMALL BUSINESSES REALLY NOT FEELING THAT THEY HAD OVER COALBED IN TRYING TO STAY AFLOAT WITH EXCESSIVE REGULATIONS AND FEES WENT THIS PRETTY MUCH HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS OWNER THAT HAS MORE THAN FIFTY EMPLOYEES THINK ABOUT JUST NOT OFFERING FREE PARKING ALTOGETHER THAT COULD THEN AFFECT THOSE THAT PERHAPS DUE HAVE TO DROUGHT YOU KNOW DRIVE AWAIT YOU TRAVEL FROM SAY RIVERSIDE TO ORANGE COUNTY OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHEN THAT HAVE THE OPPOSITE EFFECT IN IN HELPING THEM SO IN THE PARKING CASH OUT PROGRAM WHICH IS EXISTING LAW ALREADY YOU KNOW THE THIS BILL ONLY SEEKS TO CLARIFY TO AND UNBUNDLE IT SO BASICALLY IF A SMALL BUSINESSES WHICH HAS A PARKING LOT THAT THEIR- LEASING WITH THE BILLING THE CITY FOR THE BUSINESS THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING FOR THE PARKING IT'S NOW THAT A BUSINESS CAN GET THE CLARITY OF WELL HOW MUCH IS A PARKING AFTER COSTA SEIFERT RIGHT BECAUSE YOU'RE PAYING FOR THE PARKING LOT.

WE STILL DON'T HAVE A QUORUM SO SOON AS WE DO WE WILL TAKE A VOTE ON YOUR BILL WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL WHEN THE TIMES APPROPRIATE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR SALAS. I SEE MR GREY. PERFECTLY TIMED FOR AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO YOU CAN PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY SIR. I'M CHAIR MEMBERS. AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO ADDRESSES SKYROCKETING SKYROCKETING RATES OF CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT BY REQUIRING THAT CAR DEALERS PERMANENTLY MARK CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WITH THE VIN OF THE VEHICLE TO WHICH THEY'RE ATTACHED CRIMINALIZING THE TAMPERING OR REMOVAL OF THE VAN MARKING AND REQUIRING SMOG CHECKS TO INCLUDE A NOTIFICATION TO DRIVERS ABOUT WHETHER THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTER HAS BEEN MARKED. HELLO CONVERTERS ARE COMPOSED OF A VEHICLE'S EXHAUST SYSTEM THAT REDUCE HARMFUL. AIR EMISSIONS BY CONVERTING HYDROCARBONS AND CARBON MONOXIDE INTO WATER VAPOR AND CARBON DIOXIDE IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH THIS CATALYTIC CONVERTERS CONTAIN PRECIOUS METALS LIKE PALLADIUM RHODIUM AND PLATINUM. WELL CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT IS NOTHING NEW. RECENT SPIKES IN THE VALUE OF PARTIALS METALS- TRAXXAS SPIKE IN THEFTS FOR EXAMPLE FIVE YEARS AGO AN OUNCE OF RHODIUM COST A HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS BUT NOW SELLS FOR EIGHTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS. OVER THAT SAME PERIOD CATHOLIC CONVERTED TESTS OF INCREASED MORE THAN TENFOLD IN CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION ACCOUNTING FOR MORE THAN 30% OF ALL CLAIMS FILED WITH STATE FARM RECORD THIRTEEN HUNDRED KELLER CONVERTED STAFF BY TWENTY TWENTY THE NUMBER WAS FOURTEEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED AND THIRTY THREE. AND DATA FROM TWENTY TWENTY ONE INDICATES THE NUMBER MORE THAN DOUBLED TO THIRTY TWO THOUSAND STAFFS STAFFS JUST REPORTED. BY STATE FARM CUSTOMERS. HIGH PRICES FOR THE PRECIOUS METAL'S FOUNDING CATHOLIC CONVERTERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DUE TO SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS CAUSED BY THE RUSSIAN INVASION OF UKRAINE. WITH RUSSIA PRODUCING ALMOST 40% OF THE WORLD'S MIND PALLADIUM. SO LONG AS THIS FINANCIAL INCENTIVE EXISTS WE SHOULD EXPECT TO SEE THEFTS CONTINUE WHILE VEHICLES MOST OFTEN HIT BY THIEVES INCLUDE S. U. V.'S AND FLEET VEHICLES- WITH HIGH GROUND CLEARANCE- AS WELL AS TOYOTA PRIUS IS. ANY VEHICLE CAN BE TARGETED WHAT STOLEN THIEVES- TYPICALLY FLIP CATHOLIC CONVERTERS FOR FIFTY TO FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS. WHILE VICTIMS CAN EXPECT TO PAY ANYWHERE FROM ONE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO GET THE VEHICLE FIXED. UNLESS THE THIEF IS CAUGHT IN THE ACT RED HANDED LAW ENFORCEMENT HAS FEW TOOLS TO INVESTIGATE THIS CRIME AS IT IS DIFFICULT TO LINK AN INDIVIDUAL WITH ANY SPECIFIC STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTER. AS A RESULT EVEN WHEN A SUSPECT IS ARRESTED MANY ARE NEVER PROSECUTED. CONSISTENT WITH THE REQUIREMENTS UNDER AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO MARKING A CATALYTIC CONVERTER WITH THE VEHICLES VAN IS A BEST PRACTICE RECOMMENDED BY LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE COUNTRY. AS WELL AS THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR. CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS ARE CRIMES OF OPPORTUNITY WITH THIEVES TARGETING VEHICLES AND LOW RISK ENVIRONMENTS WE HAVE THE GREATEST EASE OF ACCESS. ONCE REMOVED AWAY FROM THE CRIME SCENE THERE ARE FEW OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT TO RECOVER OR TRACE A STOLEN CONVERTER. UNDER AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO ATTACHED CATALYTIC CONVERTER CAN BE EASILY TRACED BACK TO ITS ORIINAL VEHICLE AND LEGAL OWNERSHIP CAN BE ESTABLISHED. IF THE MARKING ON THE CONVERSION MOVED IN POSSESSION OF THAT CONVERTERS A CRIME WHICH WILL SERVE AS A SIGNIFICANT DETERRENT FOR ANY BLACK MARKET REPAIR SHOP OR RECYCLER TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE STOLEN PART. FURTHER MANY DRIVERS ARE UNAWARE OF THE RISK. OF THEFT UNTIL IT HAPPENS AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO REQUIRES SMOG CHECK STATIONS TO SIMPLY NOTIFY DRIVERS IF THEIR CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS MARKED. THIS NOTIFICATION WILL PROB DRIVERS TO CONSIDER VOLUNTARILY HAVING THEIR- CALIBURGER MARKED A TRACEABLE MANNER. NEARLY A DOZEN BILLS HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED IN THE LEGISLATURE THIS YEAR TO ADDRESS THIS STAFFED. AB TWENTY SIX A TWO IS ONE OF THE FEW WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT I WOULD LIKE TO THANK MY CO AUTHORS ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHOI AND PATTERSON FOR THEIR SUPPORT. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO REMAINS A WORK IN PROGRESS. LEGITIMATE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION AND SHARING THIS MARKING RECORD REQUIREMENT IS SUFFICIENTLY NARROW. FOR EXAMPLE. THE CAR DEALERS WHO PROVIDE COMPELLING INFORMATION THAT HIGHLIGHTS VARIOUS EXHAUSTED SIGNS SOME OF WHICH VERY THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER DEEP INSIDE THE VEHICLE. REQUIRING DEALERS TO MARK- A CONVERTER WITH THIS DESIGN IS IMPRACTICAL AS THEY WOULD HAVE TO DISASSEMBLE. MAJOR ENGINE COMPONENTS IN ORDER TO ACCESS THAT PART. FORGERY THE SAME DESIGN ALSO MARK MAKES A SET ACCEPTING. FOR THE DEEP DIFFICULT AND- THOSE VEHICLES USUALLY WILL NOT BE TARGETED. ANOTHER CONCERN RAISED HIS REPLACES REQUIREMENTS SALVAGE POOLS ARE VEHICLES HEADED TO DISMANTLE OURS NEITHER OF THESE EXAMPLES ARE THE TARGET OF THE BILL. I WANT TO THANK THE OPPOSITION FOR ENGAGING IN PRODUCTIVE DIALOGUE IN A FIRM THAT I AM COMMITTED TO TAKING FUTUREAMENDMENTS- THAT ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS. AB TWENTY SIX A TWO IS SUPPORTED BY THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA POLICE CHIEFS ASSOCIATION TRIPLE A THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION AND VALLEY CLEAN AIR NOW- MADAM CHAIR ON THE PHONE- THIS AFTERNOON I'M JOINED BY MERCED COUNTY SHERIFF VERN WARNKE HE WHO IS ALSO IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL WOULD LIKE TO PROVIDE. A SOME TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OPERATOR CAN YOU PLEASE FIND THE WITNESS MR- MISTER ONE K. SHERIFF WHERE QUE SORRY. YES MISS WHY THE LINE IS OPEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MANAGER THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND ADAM THANK YOU FOR YOUR- AFRICAN CHAMPION THIS BILL AS THE SHERIFF OF A WORLD COUNTY I AM OFTEN ALLED BY SEVERAL MEMBERS OF THE COMMUNITY THAT- SUPPORT. ALL EFFORTS TO GET THAT IN A- HANDLED THE SITUATION AS BEST I CAN SAID BE THE FOLKS I'M DEALING WITH THE GOVERNMENT A- SOME BUSINESSES TRACTOR OPERATORS AND SO ONE THAT HAVE BEEN HIT MULTIPLE TIMES ON THE SAME VEHICLES AFTER THEY'VE SPENT THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS GETTING THESE VEHICLES REPAIRED. THE ONLY PERSON THAT'S GETTING HURT BY THIS IS THE ACTUAL VEHICLE OWNERS YOU SEE THE MUFFLER SHOPS THE- PARTS DEPARTMENT SAID WE THAT ARE SELLING THE THINGS AND IN THE CELL BLOCK THAT ARE SELLING THE PRECIOUS METALS THESE ARE ALL PEOPLE THAT ARE GAINING PERMITS. AND AT THE EXPENSE AND COST OF. THE CONSUMER WHICH IS OWNING THE AUTOMOBILE USED CARS HAVE THE RANGE LIKE IT WAS FOR HEARD FROM ONE THOUSAND TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IN REPAIRS AND YET- WE CAN FIND PROTECTION. IN MULTITUDES WHERE IT'S STILL CONSIDERED A MISS AMERICA I WOULD STILL LIKE TO HAVE THIS AS A FELONY WILL NOT A WOBBLER BECAUSE IT COSTS THE CONSUMER WELL OVER THE NINE HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLAR THRESHOLD SO I'M IN FULL SUPPORT OF THIS AND AGAIN- ADAM. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR CHAMPION S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE A- IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF. OF AB TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO. OKAY SEEING NONE WE DO HAVE OPPOSITION WITNESSES IF THEY'RE HERE IN THE ROOM IF THEY CAN PLEASE COME UP TO THE TABLE. AND BE SURE YOU PUSH THE BUTTONS AND THEN YOU CAN INTRODUCE YOURSELF AND YOU EACH HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ANTHONY SAMPSON THE SAMPSON ADVISERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. TNC DA'S TAKEN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON TWENTY SIX EIGHTY TWO. I AM VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH US REGARDING OUR CONCERNS. OF FIRST ASEAN CDA VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE BILL INTO THIS AND IS CURRENTLY IN SUPPORT. OF SEVERAL OTHER CATALYTIC CONVERSION. A CONVERTER MEASURES. I INTRODUCED ABOUT THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE. AS IT RELATES TO THIS BILL. THE INSIDIOUS CONCERNS RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO THE REQUIREMENT THE DEALERSHIPS PERMANENTLY MARK. OR ETCH THE VIN NUMBER INTO THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BEFORE. THE VEHICLE COULD BE SOLD. BUT AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER GRAY. POINTS OUT MANY VEHICLE MODELS INCORPORATE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS PART OF THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD. REQUIRING DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TO DISASSEMBLE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. OF THE VEHICLE ENGINE JUST TO ACCESS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. AND JUST TO PROVIDE TWO EXAMPLES TO PERMANENTLY MARK ONE VOLVO MODEL IT WOULD TAKE A DEALERSHIP TECHNICIAN TWO POINT EIGHT TO FOUR HOURS. THE PERMANENTLY MARK ONE VEHICLE DEPENDING ON ENGINE VARIANTS. FOR CERTAIN ACURA MODELS IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FIVE HOURS. BUT EVEN ASSUMING A PERMANENTLY MARKING VIN NUMBERS INTO CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WAS SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE. WE WOULD NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT MANY OF THE MOST TARGETED VEHICLES ARE NOT EVEN BEING SOLD BY NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS. DATA FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT OF ONE LARGE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA SHOWS THAT THE MOST TARGETED VEHICLES ARE VERY FEW NEW CAR DEALERS EVEN SELL. RATHER THOSE ARE OFTEN SOLD THROUGH PRIVATE VENDORS LIKE RECKLESS. EBAY MOTORS AND FACEBOOK MARKET PLACE WE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH US A MORE TARGETED IN STREAMLINED SOLUTION WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS ARE NOT SADDLED WITH THE LABOR INTENSIVE AND COSTLY OBLIGATION OF PERMANENTLY MARKING EVERY VEHICLE THAT THEY SELL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFETT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE AUTOMAKERS- YOU KNOW CONSISTENT WITH WITH MY COLLEAGUE- WE BELIEVE THE BILL IS BOTH OVER OVERLY BROAD AN OVERLY NARROW- OVERLY BROAD IN ITS APPLICATION ALL VEHICLES THAT GO THROUGH THESE VARIOUS SYSTEMS AS MISTER SAMPSON NOTED NOT EVERY VEHICLE IS PRONE TO CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT AND SO WE APPRECIATE THE- THE AUTHOR'S COMMENTS ABOUT. WORKING TO NARROW THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IN ADDITION WE THINK THE BILL IS OVERLY NARROW IN FACT IN THE FACT THAT IT IT PRESCRIBES ONE SOLUTION AS THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT. BAR ACTUALLY- SUGGESTED A COUPLE DIFFERENT THINGS THAT CONSUMERS COULD DO- MOTION SENSOR ALARMS PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT THOSE SORTS OF THINGS AND IN MANY CASES MIGHT BE LESS EXPENSIVE OPTIONS TO THE CONSUMER. TO ACTUALLY. BE A DETERRENT AND A PREVENTATIVE MEASURE. WITH RESPECT TO CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT VERSES VERSES THE VAN EIGHT YOU KNOW FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE WE SEE VERY LITTLE EVIDENCE- IF ANY EXISTS THAT HAVING A VAN ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS ACTUALLY A DETERRENT TO THEFT WHEREAS. OTHER MEASURES UP COULD BE BECAUSE YOU KNOW IT MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR FOLKS TO ACCESS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IN A QUICK WAY. UNNOTICED AND UNSEEN BY OTHERS IN THE AREA AND SO WE THINK THAT- EXPLORING ADDITIONAL OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO PROTECTIVE AND PREVENTIVE MEASURES IS A IS A WORTHWHILE DISCUSSION TO HAVE IS THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD.

THANK YOU OF THE YEAR WE HAD PROBABLY A DOZEN CATALYTIC CONVERTER BILLS. SUBMITTED TO US THIS IS SUCH A HUGE PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE WE HEARD FROM PEOPLE ALL THE TIME I.

SO THIS IS CERTAINLY A PROBLEM IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD AND- IN MANY OTHERS AND YOURS IS THE LAST BILL STANDING YEARS WAS THE ONE THAT REALLY MADE THE MOST SENSE.

MR TANG YOUR UP AND WHENEVER YOU ARE READY YOU CAN PROCEED. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- PRESENTING AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN WHICH REQUIRES THAT CARP REDESIGN ZERO EMISSION VEHICLE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO WARD. PAYMENTS TO FOCUS MORE IN INCOME AND ALSO USAGE OF GASOLINE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A NUMBER OF INCENTIVE PROGRAMS I'M A BIG FAN OF MANY OF THEM. HOWEVER THE NOT THEY AREN'T TARGETING PEOPLE BASED ON HOW MUCH GASOLINE THE USE WE THINK THAT- BY TARGETING LARGER USERS AND HAVING A LARGER IN CENTER FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE USING- MORE GASOLINE LONGER COMMUTES ARE SUPER COMMUTERS SUPER USERS- WE REALLY FEEL LIKE INSTEAD OF WOULD BE. PUT TO BETTER USE I HAVE ONE- ONE SPONSOR FROM CULTURE HERE TO TESTIFY. BUT WE THINK THAT AFTER MANY YEARS IT'S TIME FOR A NEW LOOK AT THESE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS TO REALLY MAKE SURE THAT THEY WERE TARGETING OUR DOLLARS AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL GO TO YOUR WITNESS TWO MINUTES PLEASE YEAH IT'S A PLEASURE TO BE HERE THANKS FOR YOUR TIME. THE FACTORS CREATE THE NEED FOR THIS BILL A FIRST LOWER INCOME DRIVERS WHO ARE USING THE MOST GASOLINE ARE SPENDING OFTEN A QUARTER OR MORE OF THEIR HOUSEHOLD INCOME ON GASOLINE. AND SECOND BURNING GASOLINE AND LIGHT DUTY VEHICLES IS THE SINGLE BIGGEST SOURCE OF CARBON EMISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA ARE THERE PROGRAMS ARE NOT- TAKING CALIFORNIA'S GASOLINE USE DOWN WERE HOLDING STEADY AT FIFTEEN BILLION GALLONS A YEAR AND WE HAVE BEEN FOR THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND THEN THIRD DESERVE MARKET IS NOW MATURE RATIONALLY HAVING IS AB SHORTAGE OF THESE THREE THINGS GASOLINE BURDEN FAMILIES THE CLIMATE CRISIS AND THE ZIP SHORTAGE REQUIRED THAT WE REFORM IS AB INCENTIVES WE DON'T NEED TO KEEP INCENTIVISING SELVES FOR WEALTHY PEOPLE WHO AREN'T BURNING VERY MUCH GASOLINE- WE DO NEED TO MAXIMIZE EMISSIONS CUTS BY GETTING THE DRIVERS WHO ARE USING THE MOST GASOLINE TO SWITCHED HIS ABS. AND W DO NEED TO MAXIMIZE EQUITY BY- EXPEDITING THE SWITCHES ABS FOR THE LOWER INCOME DRIVERS WHO ARE USING THE MOST GASOLINE. AND WE DO NEED TO ENSURE THAT ARE SCARCE SUPPLY THEMSELVES IS GOING TO THE BIGGEST USERS OF GASOLINE- AND DISPLACING THE MOST GHASTLY IMPOSSIBLE THE THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY IF THE BIGGEST GASOLINE USERS WERE TO SWITCH FIRST IT WOULD TAKE NINE MILLION SALES ON THE ROAD TO CUT OUR VEHICLE EMISSIONS IN HALF. IF THE BIGGEST GASOLINE USER SWITCHED LAST AS THEY'RE CURRENTLY ON TRACK TO DO IT'LL TAKE TWENTY FOUR MILLION ZAB ON THE ROAD NEARLY THREE TIMES AS MUCH. ABOUT WAIT THERE'S MORE INCENTIVE INCENTIVIZING THE BIGGEST GASOLINE USERS TO SWITCH TO CELEBS. WOULD ADDITIONALLY SAVE THEM UP TO AROUND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH ON FUEL AND MAINTENANCE. THAT MONEY IS NOT EVEN COMING FROM THE GOVERNMENT- AND THAT COULD BE AN ADDED BENEFIT FOR THEM OFTEN HELPING THEM TO MAKE THERE'S AB OTHER PAYMENTS ON THERE'S A- THE AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN SIMPLY ENSURES. THAT SEVEN SENATORS MAXIMIZE EMISSIONS CUTS UP FOR THE PEOPLE WHO NEED IT THE MOST SO I URGE THAT YOU PLEASE VOTE AYE ON AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN. THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH WE DO HAVE ONE OPPOSITION WITNESS BEFORE WE GO TO THAT WITNESSES OR ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN PERSON. IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. OKAY SEEING NONE. WE DO HAVE- SOMEONE FROM THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT. REGISTERED HIS OPPOSITION ARE THEY HERE. JUST IN CASE OPERATOR CAN YOU OPEN THE PHONE LINES AND SEE IF THERE IS IN OUR A REGISTERED WITNESS IN OPPOSITION FROM THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT FOR THE BILL. FOR AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN. AND IF YOU ARE COULD YOU PLEASE PRESS STAR ZERO AT THIS TIME. I DON'T SHOW ANYBODY QUEUING UP FOR THAT OKAY. AS ANYBODY IN THE ROOM WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. ASING NONE WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE PHONE LINES TO OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYBODY WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION OF AB TWENTY EIGHTEEN AT. TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN. THANK YOU FAMILIES IN GENERAL IF YOU DO WANT TO SHOW SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY SIXTEEN PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN THAT'S ONE THEN ZERO FOR SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO AB TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN. ENSURE PERSON I HAVE NO ONE IN Q. OKAY LET'S TAKE IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY YES MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU. I GET THE CONCEPT OF SWITCHING TO IF YOUR GOALS REDUCE EMISSIONS IT SEEMS LIKE INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE THAT DRIVE THE MOST. CONSUME THE MOST GAS. IS AN EFFICIENT WAY TO ACCOMPLISH CYCLE. THE MY QUESTION IS HOW DOES THIS CHANGE THE STATUS QUO WHAT WHAT WHAT IS SHIFTED AROUND I'VE LOST TRACK OF EXACTLY HOW WE'RE- INCENTIVIZING SETS PRESENTLY I THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION SO WE ALSO WE WOULD ALSO ENCOURAGE NOT JUST TO DO THAT BUT ALSO TO- FACTOR IN INCOME. SO THE STATUS QUO NOW IS TO CLEAN CARS FOR ALL WHICH IS THE- ONES TARGETING LOWER INCOME FAMILIES ARE THE ONES. THAT ARE YOU IF YOU HAVE LIKE A GAS GUZZLER WILL TRY TO GET TRY TO GAS GUZZLER INTO A CLEANER CAR. BUT THAT IS JUST TARGETING LOWER INCOME FAMILIES WHAT WE SAY IS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO FACTORY AND WE THINK YOU SHOULD HAVE A LARGER IS CENTER FOR STATE FOR CLEAN CARS FOR ALL- IF YOU ARE. DRIVING FURTHER YOU'RE USING MORE GASOLINE NOW THERE'S A CLEAN VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM WHICH THE INCOME HAS JUST RECENTLY DROPPED SO- YOU COULD CALL IT MORE OF A MIDDLE INCOME- PROPOSAL WHICH IS JUST FOR NEW. CLEAN CARS SAME THING SO IF YOU IN OVER SO I WENT FROM. IF YOU GO FROM YOU KNOW ELECTRACARD ANOTHER LECTURE CARP INSTEAD OF A PART BE THE SAME BUT IF YOU'RE GOING FROM A GAS CAR YOU'RE DRIVING A LOT OF GAS YOU'RE USING A LOT OF GAS. THAT INCENTIVE WOULD BE HIGHER SO IT'S REALLY TRYING TO. JUST REALLY QUICK LITTLE MORE FOCUS AROUND THAT INSTEAD OF IT IN A PERFECT WORLD WE WOULD ACTUALLY REALLY PROBABLY HAVE. ONE INCENTIVE PROGRAM RATHER THAN. YOU KNOW A NEW PROGRAM FOR ALL THESE THINGS- BUT THAT'S NOT THE WORLD THAT WE'RE IN RIGHT NOW. THANKS MY ONLY UP. IS THERE A SORT OF DIFFERENCE IN HOW UNDER THIS BILL HOW BUSINESS USE VEHICLES TO BE TREATED VERSUS PERSONAL USE VEHICLES THE REASON I ASK IS THAT THAT CAME UP IN THE NEWS ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED REBATE WHICH I JUST THINK ABOUT MY DISTRICT I DRIVE AROUND. IN IT ALL THE TIME LIKE WE ALL DO OVER A HOMES BIG THROW YOU DRIVE A LOT THERE EVERYBODY DOES THERE'S NOBODY YOU SEE DRIVING MORE THAN LIKE A LANDSCAPER RIGHT AND IF THAT PERSON. THE WORD INCENTIVIZE IN A- YOU KNOW SMALLER TRUCKS TO INTENDED BE WHAT THEY DRIVE BUT IF THEY WERE INCENTIVIZED TO SWITCH TO OBSERVE I COULD SEE TREMENDOUS SAVINGS FOR THEM THE NUMBER. I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT. CARVING THEM OUT IN SOME WAY AND IMPORTANTLY BECAUSE THEY MAY HAVE THAT BUSINESS THERE THAT THAT DIFFICULT MAY BE REGISTERED AS A BUSINESS USED VEHICLE. I'M I'M DONE GO INTO THAT SO- I NONPROFIT HAS BEEN DOING SOME RESEARCH AND YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT THERE ARE SOME- LEAD VEHICLES. THAT ARE USING FAR DISPROPORTIONATELY YOU KNOW LARGER AMOUNTS OF GASOLINE. AND THOSE SHOUD BE FOCUSED ON THIS. BILL APPLIES TO PRIVATE VEHICLE EVEY INCENTIVE PROGRAMS BUT I THINK YOU MAKE A GREAT POINT THAT IT WOULD BE A REALLY GOOD IDEA TO INCENTIVIZE THOSE USING THE MOST GASOLINE AND OTHER. FOR OTHER TYPES OF VEHICLES TO ALSO SWITCH FIRST. IT THE PART THE REASON WE HADN'T FOCUSED THERE ARE MUCH IS. YOU ONLY HAD SEDANS THAT WERE ELECTRIC VEHICLES VERY FEW S. U. V. OPTIONS WERE NOW STARTED SEE I MEAN A LANDSCAPER COULD REALLY DO IT BECAUSE THERE AREN'T ANY PICKUP TRUCKS. NOW THAT THERE ARE PICKUP TRUCKS YOU CAN POLICIES I THINK. THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE CAN START THINKING ABOUT FOR SURE BUT THIS DOESN'T. CHANGE ISN'T CHANGE THE STRUCTURE OF ANY OF THE- CENTER PROGRAMS OUTSIDE OF JUST. ASKING THEM TO FOCUS MORE ON. WHO THE USERS ARE AND WHO'S WHO THE BUYERS OF THIS VEHICLE. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- THANK YOU AYE ACTUALLY I APPRECIATE MY PREVIOUS COLLEAGUES- QUESTION AND COMMENTS AS WELL BECAUSE I AGREE A LOT OF THE TIMES AND MY DISTRICT IS SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER THAN HIS IT'S PROBABLY ONLY ABOUT TEN SQUARE MILES BUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT WHO DRIVES AT THE MOST IT'S USUALLY LANDSCAPING CONSTRUCTION FOLKS SO- SO LONG AS THERE. GIVEN THE AND SEND IT EXTENDED THE INCENTIVE IS WELL I THINK THAT'LL GO A LONG WAY FOR A LOT OF THESE FOLKS- AND AGAIN ONCE AGAIN ONCE THE WE HAVE CORPS MIGHT BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL BECAUSE I SUPPORT WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WE'RE GOING TO PAUSE FOR A SECOND AND TAKE ROLL CALL BECAUSE WE WILL HAVE A QUORUM SO SECRETARY CAN YOU PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. IN HERE FRIEDMAN HERE FONG ON HERE BERMAN.

IN SOME AREAS WHO SAY THAT IT'S THE LACK OF CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE IN THEIR AREA THAT'S MUCH MORE BARRIER TO PEOPLE THAT THEY SITE- YOU KNOW OTHER TYPES OF ISSUES SO- YOU KNOW I THINK AS WE START SEEING MORE AND AS WE MOVE MORE TOWARDS THAT THE FUTURE IT'LL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT DOES CHANGE PEOPLE'S BUYING HABITS IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE STATE IN A DIFFERENT POPULATIONS OVER TIME- BUT I REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR FOCUSING AND DRILLING DOWN ON THIS AND I'LL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AND WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE BEFORE WE TAKE A VOTE THE RIVER REALLY PRETTY I THINK- YOUR YOUR COMMENTS ARE RIGHT SPOT ON I THINK- NOW THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING THESE ARE PROGRAMS FOR QUITE A NUMBER OF YEARS I THINK IT'S REALLY TIME TO TAKE A CLOSER LOOK YOU KNOW SEE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING I THINK WE ALL HAVE A LOT OF ASSUMPTIONS AS TO WHAT WOULD WORK NOT NOW THAT WE HAVE SOME DATA.

SO THAT ANY FOR A POLICY RECOMMENDATION IS CONSISTENT WITH MEETING THE STATE'S EMISSION REDUCTION REQUIREMENTS AS WELL- BUT THEY CAN'T EASE UP ON ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION BECAUSE- WE HAVE TO MEET THE CLEAN AIR ATTAINMENT.

NO ONE WANTS- YOU KNOW IDOLING SHIPS OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA THAT ARE THAT'S BURNING BUNKER FUEL ON WANTS TRUCKERS A WAITING FOR FOUR HOURS- CONGESTED AT THE PORTS NO ONE WANTS AND THE CONTAINERS-IN THE COMMUNITIES IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS NEIGHBORING- THE PORTS SO WE'RE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THE SUPPLY CHAIN IS A RESILIENT YET EFFICIENT- TO SO THAT WE CAN MOVE THE GOODS THROUGHOUT THE STATE CALIFORNIA. HAS ANY INTENTION OF HAVING SPECIFICITY IN TERMS OF HAVING A LABOR REPRESENTATIVE IN THE ADVISORY. OR HAPPY TED SAID TO HELP WORK OUT THE SPECIFICS- AS WELL AS BEFORE BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY RIGHT NOW THERE IS JUST NO ONE. IN CHARGE. AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO. WE SHOULD THE NEED TO HAVE A ONE POINT PERCENT ALL OF THAT DID CERTAINLY SEEM TO BE AN ISSUE AND- WE ARE HAVING SUPPLY CHAIN ISSUES BUT IN TERMS OF. IF THEY'RE GOING TO BE ADVISING TO HAVE A CROSS SECTION.

DAVIES DAVIES I'D GIPSON GIPSON AYE KALRA NOT GOING TO MISS THE CHANCE TO MEMBERS ARE. KALRA LEE NAZARIAN. WHEN O'DONNELL. O'DONNELL I WORKED. WARD I WEEKS. ZERO AND THERE THAT BILLS THAT I'M GOING TO PASS THE GAVEL TO MY VERY CAPABLE VICE CHAIR MISTER FONG TO PRESENT AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR. A PLEASE PROCEED WHEN YOU'RE READY. I THANK YOU I WILL ALSO BE BRIEF WITH THIS BILL- THIS IS A BILL TO HELP REMOVE UP WHAT A WILDLIFE FROM OUR HIGHWAYS- AND TO PRODUCE TO HELP CALTRANS DEVELOP MORE WILDLIFE COOPER CROSSINGS AND UNDER CROSSINGS TO BOTH PROTECT BIODIVERSITY ALLOW MIGRATORY ANIMALS TO MIGRATE. BUT TO ALSO PROTECT HUMAN BEINGS AND LIFE AND SAFETY BY GETTING LARGE MIGRATORY ANIMALS LIKE DEER OUT OF OUR HIGHWAYS WHERE THERE ARE EVERY YEAR LITERALLY HUNDREDS OF TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS IN CALIFORNIA CAUSED BY COLLISIONS WITH THESE ANIMALS NOW THE ONLY QUESTION I'VE HAD ON THIS BILL HAS BEEN ABOUT THE FUNDING AND I DO WANT TO POINT OUT. THAT WHILE THE COST OF THESE OVER CROSSINGS CAMBY HI BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL TRANSPORTATION FUNDS ARE AVAILABLE FOR WILDLIFE PROJECTS LIKE THIS AS PART OF THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET GOVERNOR NEWSOM ALLOCATED SIXTY ONE MILLION DOLLARS TO BUILD WILDLIFE CROSSINGS ACROSS THE STATE AND PRESIDENT BIDEN'S INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT JOBS ACT INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED FIFTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS NATIONWIDE OVER FIVE YEARS FOR A PILOT PROGRAM. AND ADDS WILDLIFE CROSSINGS IS ELIGIBLE FOR SIGNIFICANT FUNDING UNDER THE NASH UNDER THE FREIGHT AND HIGHWAY PROGRAM HAT FOR US NOT TO HAVE A PROGRAM LIKE THIS TO FORMALIZE WAYS FOR CALTRANS TO EVALUATE THE BEST PLACE FOR THESE CROSSINGS COULD LEAVE CALIFORNIA TO LEAVE FEDERAL MONEY ON THE TABLE WHICH WE DON'T WANT TO DO WE WANT TO SHOW IS A STATE THAT WE ARE READY TO IMPLEMENT THESE PROJECTS THAT WE HAVE IDENTIFIED THE BEST PLACES TO PUT THEM. WE PRIORITIZE PUBLIC SAFETY AND WE WANT TO TRY TO BRING IN AS MUCH MONEY AS WE CAN FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND WITHOUT I WOULD ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND I DO HAVE A WITNESS HERE IN SUPPORT. PLEASE PROCEED LAMA COMMENTS ON THE ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR MY NAME IS DR JUSTIN DELLINGER I'M WILDLIFE RESEARCH WITH THE UC DAVIS WILDLIFE HEALTH CENTER A SPECIALIZED OWN LARGE CARNIVORE RESEARCH AND I'VE HAD THE PRIVILEGE OF STUDYING ASPECTS OF- CARNIVORE ECOLOGY ACROSS CALIFORNIA WITH A SPECIAL FOCUS ON. HABITAT CONNECTIVITY. OTHER RESEARCHERS NINE DEMONSTRATED THAT VEHICLE STRIKES OUR PRIMARY SOURCE OF MORTALITY FOR IMPORTANT SPECIES SUCH AS MOUNT LINES PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND THE BAY AREA. FURTHER NOT LINE'S NOT KILLED BY VEHICLES IN THESE AREAS ARE STILL NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY BUSY ROADS. BUSY ROADWAYS ACT AS BARRIERS AND CREATE ISLANDS OF HABITAT FOR MOUNTAIN LIONS CAN BECOME ISOLATED AND EXPERIENCE INBREEDING. IN FACT THE CURRENT PETITION TO LIST NOT LINES AS THREATENED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS ESSENTIALLY DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF VEHICLES IN BUSY ROADWAYS. ON THE SPECIES. WITHOUT WILDLIFE CROSSING STRUCTURES TO HELP- MOUNT LINES CROSS BUSY ROADWAYS THIS TOP CARNIVORE COULD POSSIBLY GO EXTINCT IN PART TO CALIFORNIA. LAW CITIZENS THIS SPECIES COULD LEAD TO UNRAVELING OF ECOSYSTEMS REGIONALLY. NOT ONLY ARE CALIFORNIA'S BUSY ROADWAYS A THREAT TO EXISTING POPULATIONS OF NATIVE CARNIVORES LIKE MOUNTAIN LIONS. THEY'RE ALSO PROVING TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE ABILITY TO OTHER CARNIVORES LIKE GRAY WOLVES TO RECOLONIZE CALIFORNIA. THE WOLF- ARE NINETY THREE AS EVIDENCE OF THIS GIVEN HE WAS HIT AND KILLED BY A VEHICLE ON OUR FIVE LAST YEAR. THUS WILDLIFE CROSSING STRUCTURES ARE NECESSARY TO ALLEVIATE THE PROBLEMS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED FROM OUTLINES AND OTHER WILDLIFE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT TO BE EFFECTIVE RESEARCH ON WILDLIFE MOVEMENT A GIVEN LOCALE IS NEEDED TO ENSURE ACROSS AND STRUCTURALLY BUILT. IN THE BEST LOCATION AND OF THE CORRECT SPECIFICATIONS. LASTLY MANY STAFF WITH IMPORTANT STATE AGENCIES AGREE THAT THESE CROSS INSTRUCTIONS ARE IMPORTANT HOWEVER. STAFF IN THE SAME AGENCIES REGULARLY DEAL WITH MULTIPLE PRIORITIES AND ARE UNLIKELY TO BE ABLE TO DEVOTE THE NECESSARY TIME AND RESOURCES TOWARDS DEVELOPMENT AND CONSTRUCTION ACROSS INSTRUCTORS. UNLESS MANDATED TO DO SO. THUS IF THIS BILL IS NOT PASSED IT IS UNLIKELY CROSSING STRUCTURES WILL BE BUILT. IN CLOSING MUST ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND ACT NOW TO CONSERVE CALIFORNIA'S WILDLIFE THANK YOU. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DO IS STILL HAVE SOME ON THE PHONE DO YOU HAVE SOME A WITNESS ON THE PHONE. FRAZIER SHELLING YEAH THESE RECEIVING READY. TO DIRECT YES OKAY GREAT. HI MY NAME IS SAY THE SELLING I'M THE DIRECTOR OF THE VERTICALITY CENTER UC DAVIS THANKS TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR HEARING MY SUPPORTIVE TESTIMONY FOR AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR. AS DR GALLAGHER POINTED OUT WE HAVE A LOT OF WILDLIFE AND WILDLIFE HABITAT IN CALIFORNIA. MY CENTER THE ROAD CALL THE CENTER HAS- THE LARGEST ROAD KILL REPORTING SYSTEM OF ITS KIND IN THE U. S. AND EVERY YEAR WE REPORT TO IMPORTANT ASPECTS OF THIS ECOLOGICAL HARM. NUMBER ONE THE PRECISE LOCATIONS OF HOT SPOT THE COLLISIONS WITH DIVERSE SPECIES. AND NUMBER TWO THE COST TO THE DRIVING PUBLIC AND BY EXTENSION CALIFORNIA THESE COLLISIONS. OVER THE LAST FIVE YEARS. OUR SYSTEM TO SHOWN THAT OVER A BILLION DOLLARS IN COSTS FROM THESE CRASHES RESULTING CALIFORNIA. MOST OF THESE COSTS ARE DUE TO COLLISIONS WITH DEER AT LEAST AS MANY AS ARE HUNTED EVERY YEAR. AND ARE FOCUSED ON A FEW THOUSAND MILES OF HIGHWAY WHICH ALTHOUGH IT SOUNDS LIKE A LOT DOES MAKE THE PROBLEM MORE TRACTABLE. SOMETIMES A LOT OF DON'T CAUSE ANY DAMAGE TO VEHICLES LIKE THE THOUSANDS OF THE PACIFIC NITZER KILLED EVERY YEAR. ON ABA BRIDGE ROAD IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. BUT THAT THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE ECOLOGICAL HARM THAT WERE CAUSING EVERY TIME WE'RE DRIVING. THROUGH THEIR HABITAT. WHILE THE VEHICLE COLLISION DATA IS AN IMPORTANT WAY THAT WE CAN USE TO DETERMINE WHERE WILDLIFE CROSSING SHOULD BE BUILT WHICH IS THE PURPOSE OF AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR. BUT WE ONLY COLLECT DATA FOR A FEW PERCENT OF ALL THE COLLISIONS AND ALL THE ROADWAYS IN CALIFORNIA. ONE WAY WE COULD COLLECT MORE DATA ABOUT COLLISIONS WOULD BE TO APPROPRIATE FUNDS REST BETWEEN NINETY FIVE. WHICH INCLUDES A PUBLIC REPORTING FUNCTION SO FAR HAS NOT BEEN FUNDED OR HAD ANY ACTION FROM CDFW- TO MOST OTHER STATES IN THE WEST CALIFORNIA BUILDS VERY FEW WILDLIFE CROSSINGS. AND ENDS SHARE FRIEDMAN POINTED OUT THAT WILL LEAVE MONEY ON THE TABLE. ON FRIDAY CALIFORNIA OFFICIALS WILL HELP BREAK GROUND FOR THE WALLIS ANNENBERG WILDLIFE CROSSING. THE LARGEST WALLET CROSSING BUT IT'S KIND IN THE WORLD THIS WOULD BE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHICH WILL BENEFIT MOUNTAIN LIONS AND OTHER SPECIES. I BELIEVE AB TWENTY THREE FORTY FOUR WOULD ALLOW US TO START CATCHING UP TO OTHER STATES. IN MITIGATING THESE EXTENSIVE IMPACTS TO WILDLIFE. AND SO THE CALIFORNIA VALUES BOTH THIS DIVERSE WILDLIFE. AND DRIVER SAFETY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. WHEN I GO TO ANYONE IN HERE IN THE ROOM THAT WANTS TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OR OPPOSITION TO. AB TWENTY FORTY FOUR. C. NINE.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF AND THE ELECTED THANK CHAIR FRIEDMAN FOR BRING THIS FORWARD- I THINK THAT ESPECIALLY WITH THE- HAVING DFW ACTUALLY CREATE AN ACTION PLAN- AND THEN KIND OF. FILL IN THE DIFFERENT THIS POTENTIAL PROJECTS IS CRITICAL YOU KNOW WE HAVE A WILDLIFE QUARTER AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS SENECA COUNTY THAT LITERALLY CROSSES. IN FROM ONE END TO THE NEXT FIVE OR SIX ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS AND SO IS A REGIONAL STATING OF WHAT IT REALLY NEEDS TO BE DONE TO REALLY UNDERSTAND- THE MOVEMENT PATTERNS AND WHERE PROJECTS MAKE SENSE OF WHERE THEY DON'T MAKE SENSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE THINK THAT ALL I NEED ONE OF MY DISTRICT BECAUSE AB OR SEE BUT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY HAD THAT MORE A COMPREHENSIVE ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE WHAT MAKES MOST SENSE WHAT'S MOST COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL. I ALSO REALLY LIKE- HAVING THE ASSESSMENTS OF POTENTIAL BARRIERS BY THAT BEEN DONE BEFORE COMMENCING WITH PROJECT PLANNING WE HAVE SO MANY LEGACY PROJECTS THAT ARE THAT ARE NIGHTMARES THAT WE'RE NOW TRYING TO ENGINEER AROUND OR THROUGH OVER. A THAT COULD BE AVOIDED GOING FORWARD- BUT BASED UPON- OF THIS LEGISLATION SO- THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M VERY GRATEFUL THAT. OF THE CHAIR ALSO LED ME TO JOIN ON A JOINT AUTHORS AND- PRETTY HAPPY ABOUT THE BILL THANK YOU. MISTER GIBSON. REAL WILL BRIEF- IS IRONIC BECAUSE- LAST NIGHT I WAS WATCHING- SOCIAL MEDIA THE TICK TOCK OR SOMEONE- AND I DON'T THINK IS IN CALIFORNIA. BUT ON A ROAD IT WAS SNOWING. AND HIS DRIVER ACTUALLY HIT A BEAR. AND THE BEAR GOT UP AND STARTED WALKING FELL DOWN AGAIN RIGHT- AND THE REASON WHY I BROUGHT THAT UP BECAUSE I THINK IT GOES TO WHY WE HAVE TO HAVE THESE CROSSING WHY IT'S IMPORTANT. I'M FOR THIS THE WILDLIFE IS IMPORTANT DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED BECAUSE THE VIDEO ON TURNED OFF WITH THE BEAR WAS AXED WAS ABSOLUTELY FINE CROSS IT WAS HURT.
