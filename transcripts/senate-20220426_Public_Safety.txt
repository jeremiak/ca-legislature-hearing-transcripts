FOR THEIR HARD WORK ON THIS BILL I'M HERE TODAY WITH THE JOINT AUTHORS CENTER PORTANTINO. ON S. B. NINE EIGHT SIX PREVENTING CATTLE OCCURRED CONVERTER THEFT AS I THINK ALL OF US KNOW KELLY CONVERTER THEFTS BECOME IT THAT'S A BECOME AN EPIDEMIC ACROSS CALIFORNIA. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL CHALLENGES OF PROSECUTING THE THEFT CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. CURRENTLY UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW. SB NINE EIGHT SIX WOULD ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND WILL PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S BY REQUIRING CAR DEALERS TO MARK VEHICLES EQUIPPED WITH CATALYTIC CONVERTERS- FOR SALE. THE ETCHING PROCESS CAN BE EASY INEXPENSIVE IN FACT I HAVE H. SOME CATHOLIC CONVERTERS MYSELF ALSO CURRENTLY THE EXISTING LAWS INSUFFICIENT BECAUSE IT LACKS THE OBLIGATION OF A CORE RECYCLER TO OBTAIN INFORMATION NECESSARY TO IDENTIFY THE ORIGIN OF A USE CATALYTIC CONVERTER THAT IS THAT THE CORE RECYCLER PURCHASED THEREFORE SB NINE EIGHT SIX WOMAN THE CODE BY REQUIRING CORE RECYCLERS TO LOG THE UNIQUE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER OF EACH CATALYTIC CONVERTER. IN ADDITION. OTHER CURRENT IDEA. CARMEN'S WESLEY S. B. NINE EIGHT SIX WOULD REQUIRE CORPS RECYCLERS PROVIDE PAYMENT. FOR CATHOLIC CONVERTERS- THAT THEY BE MADE TRACEABLE BY FOR PAYMENT OTHER THAN CASH I HAVE WITH ME ALEXANDER- CANAAN WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE IN ROSEMARY SHAKE HAND WITH CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY. BOB PROVIDES THOSE TWO WITNESSES TOO MANY EACH SO FAR WHAT NO PARTICULAR ORDER WHOEVER'S READY WE CAN GO WITH YOUR FIRST WITNESS. AND ALSO- IF YOU MIGHT- ALLOW JOINT AUTHORS CENTER PORTANTINO TO MAKE AN OPENING STATEMENT RIGHT HERE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST ECHO MY COLLEAGUES' COMMENTS CATALYTIC CONVERTER CONVERTER THEFT IS OUT OF CONTROL ACROSS CALIFORNIA- AND WE MUST TAKE PRUDENT STEPS TO ADDRESS IT AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES AND THAT'S- OBVIOUSLY THE APPROPRIATE. WE S. RIVAL. WE'LL START WITH YOUR FIRST- LEAD AUTHOR I MEAN WITNESS SOME SORRY- SHANAHAN ON THE LINE MODERATOR TO WE HAVE EITHER THE TO. WHEN THIS IS ON THE LINE. MODERATOR. DO WE HAVE THE MODERATOR ONLINE. GOOD MORNING EVERYONE THIS IS ALEX. MAKE. ALL RIGHT WE WILL START WITH OUR FIRST WITNESS IN SUPPORT YOU HAVE TO MANAGE. HEY GOOD MORNING EVERYONE MY NAME IS ALEX KIRK JANET I'M A DEPUTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WITH LOS ANGELES COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE WITH THE SPONSORS OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION. ABILITY A FOR TWENTY NINE YEARS FOURTEEN OF WHICH WERE WITH THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY AUTO THEFT TASK FORCE WHERE HE SERVED AS THE DEPUTY IN CHARGE. I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU TODAY ABOUT THE DRAMATIC INCREASE IN CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT THEY'RE NOT GONNA BELIEVER THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER PROBLEM WILL OPEN UP AT THAT MAKE IT'S BEEN A DISASTER. I WOULD LOVE HOWEVER- HOW WE ADDRESS THIS ISSUE PROSECUTORS ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ALL FACING THE SAME PROBLEM A LIZARD IN IDENTIFYING NUMBERS ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS IT'S ALMOST IMPOSSIBLE FOR US TO SUCCESSFULLY PROSECUTE CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT. EVERYONE KNOWS THAT ALL OF OUR CARS HAVE I DON'T SERIAL NUMBERS CALLED VIN THE NUMBER THAT'S ON YOUR DASHBOARD. BUT WHAT YOU MIGHT NOT KNOW IS THAT SAME BEEN NUMBERS ALL OVER THE INSIDE OF YOUR CAR. IT'S AN ANTI THEFT DEVICE. VIRTUALLY EVERY. COMPONENT INSIDE YOUR CAR'S MORE WITH YOUR VIN NUMBER EXCEPT FOR ONE THAT YOUR CATALYTIC CONVERTER. THEFTS OF CATALYTIC CONVERTERS HAS EXPLODED HERE IN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THIS CRIME IS A LOT OF MONEY AND IT'S VIRTUALLY RISK FREE. UNLESS THE THIEVES ARE ACTUALLY CAUGHT IN THE ACT THE POLICE CAN DO NOTHING. BECAUSE WE CAN'T PROVE THAT THE CONVERSAR. R. TWO THEN FOR CAT OFTENTIMES RECYCLERS. AND WE CAN'T CURRENTLY HOLD THE RECYCLERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PURCHASE OF STOLEN GOODS BECAUSE WITHOUT THAT IDENTIFYING NUMBER THERE'S NO WAY TO PROVE THAT THE CUTS ARE STOLEN. THIS BILL ADDRESSES BOTH ISSUES AND WILL HAVE IMMEDIATE IMPACT. SHOULD THIS BILL GOING TO AFFECT IF THE THIEVES ARE CAUGHT WITH EVEN IF YOU CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THAT CAN BE PROVEN TO BE STOLEN. WE CAN HOLD THEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR ACTIONS. WHAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS CAN BE IDENTIFIED WIDESPREAD MARKET FOR THE STOLEN PARTS SHOULD COLLAPSE. NO CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS LIKE ALL OF THAT IS NEVER GOING TO COMPLETELY GO AWAY. BUT THIS BILL WILL DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE PROBLEM. OUR LAW ENFORCEMENT COLLEAGUES ACROSS THE COUNTRY ARE ALL CONSIDERING A SIMILAR APPROACH AND WE URGE YOU TO DO THE SAME. IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER THEM OTHERWISE I JUST ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL. THANK YOU. MOVE TO OUR NEXT WITNESS. ROSE MERRY SHATTERED BRAG. RIGHT THERE ARE CHORE BOGEY AND MEMBERS I'M WITH MARY SHEA HAND PRESIDENT CONSUMERS FOR AUTO RELIABILITY AND SAFETY OR CARS SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX CARS HAVE SPEARHEADED ENACTMENT OF NUMEROUS LAWS IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY TO IMPROVE PROTECTION FOR OWNERS OF NEW AND USED VEHICLES CARS DRUM WE SUPPORT PASSAGE OF SB NINETY EIGHTY SIX AND WE APPLAUD SENATOR I'M BURKE AND IN ORDER PORTANTINO FOR THEIR LEADERSHIP. IN CHAMPIONING THIS IMPORTANT AND TIMELY MEASURE AS YOU'VE ALREADY HEARD AND I WILL REPEAT- THAT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS HAVE BEEN. SKYROCKETING AND- MAKE THEM. CATTLE CONVERTERS HAVE BEEN. OFTEN FACE REAL HARDSHIP AS A RESULT. WHILE INSURANCE USUALLY COVERS THE BULK OF THE REPLACEMENT COST VEHICLE OWNERS ARE OFTEN THAT HAVING TO PAY HEFTY DEDUCTIBLES AND SOMETIMES ALSO SEE THEIR INSURANCE RATE INCREASE. NOT TO MENTION THE HASSLE FACTOR OF HAVING TO MAKE ARRANGEMENTS FOR REPAIRS AND TAKING TIME FROM BUSY WORK SCHEDULE TO GET THE REPAIRS DONE. AND IN ADDITION- UNFORTUNATELY SOME VEHICLE OWNERS IN HIGH RISK AREAS OR WITH CARS THAT TEND TO BE TARGETED BY THIEVES ARE VICTIMIZED REPEATEDLY AND NAM ESTABLISHMENTS HAVE BEEN HAVING TO INVEST- VERY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT IN SECURITY EXPENSES AND OTHER- ATTEMPTS TO. HE TURNED BASS SB NINE EIGHTY SIX WILL ADDRESS BOTH ENDS OF THE TRANSACTION AND WE RESPECTFULLY I VOTE I REQUEST YOUR IPHONE THANK YOU.

ALL RIGHT NOW WILL MOVE TO OPPOSITION IS OR ANY WITNESSES HERE IN THE ROOM- I GUESS WE HAVE ANTHONY SAMPSON AND JOHN MOFFETT- YOU MAY BEGIN YOUR TESTIMONY OF TWO MINUTES EACH GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN WAS ANTHONY SAMPSON THE SAMPSON ADVISERS HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS ASSOCIATION. C. IN CDA HAS TAKEN AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON SB NINETY SIX VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR AND THE SPONSORS WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE IN A DIALOGUE WITH US REGARDING OUR CONCERNS I VERY MUCH SUPPORT THE UNDERLYING INTENT OF THE BILL INTO THIS END SUPPORTS. LAKE CONVERTER- MEASURES PENDING IN THE LEGISLATURE RIGHT NOW FOCUSED. ON ENFORCEMENT. AS IT RELATES TO THIS PARTICULAR BILL. ASEAN CTAS CONCERNS RELATE SPECIFICALLY TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT DEALERSHIPS PERMANENTLY MARKER ETCH THE VIN NUMBER INTO THE- CONVERTER BEFORE. TOLD AS A COMMITTEE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT AND AS WE'VE DISCUSSED WITH THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS THE SPONSORS- MANY VEHICLE MODELS INCORPORATE THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER IS PART OF THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD. REQUIRE DEALERSHIP TECHNICIANS TO DISASSEMBLE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE VEHICLE ENGINE JUST ACCESS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. TO BROUGHT PROVIDE JUST TWO EXAMPLES TO PERMANENTLY MARK ONE VOLVO MODEL WOULD TAKE DEAL PROTECT. TO FOUR HOURS THE PERMANENTLY MARK ONE VEHICLE DEPENDING ON ENGINE VARIANTS. AND FOR CERTAIN ACCURATE MODELS IT CAN TAKE TWO TO FIVE HOURS. BUT EVEN ASSUMING A PERMANENT MARKING VIN NUMBERS INTO CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WAS SIMPLE AND INEXPENSIVE WE WOULD JUST NOTE FOR THE COMMITTEE THAT MANY OF THE MOST TARGETED VEHICLES ARE NOT BEING SOLD. THE CARD FOR SHIPS. DATA FROM THE SERVICE DEPARTMENT ONE LARGE TOYOTA DEALERSHIP. FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA IS THAT THE MOST TARGETED VEHICLE. ARE THOUSAND SIXTY TWO THOUSAND NINE PRIUS IS WHICH VERY NEW CAR DEALERS EVEN SELF. RATHER THOSE ARE SOLD THROUGH PRIVATE VENDOR SELLERS LIKE REGULAR THE VOTER. AGAIN. AUTHOR I'M MORE. SOLELY WHILE ALSO THE YOU CARTY. ARE NOT SADDLED WITH THE LABOR INTENSIVE. AND COSTLY OBLIGATION OF PERMANENTLY MARKING EACH VEHICLE THEY SELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT THIS. GOOD MORNING MR CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFETT ON BEHALF OF THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION OR THE TRADE ASSOCIATION FOR THE AUTO MAKERS HERE TODAY. STANDING WITH OUR OUR DEALER PARTNERS- WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON THE BILL WE HAVE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICES AND THEIR STAFF AND APPRECIATE THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THIS BILL- ONE AGREE WITH WITH MISTER SAMPSON THAT WE BELIEVE AS AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED THE BILL IS OVERLY BROAD. CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT IS A IS A CRIME OF EXPEDIENCY AND IF- IF IT TAKES TWO TO THREE HOURS FOR A TRAINED TECHNICIAN TO GET TO A CATALYTIC CONVERTER IT'S PROBABLY NOT A PRIME TARGET FOR CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT- IS. THE BILL IT'S TO BE NARROWED IN ITS SCOPE IN ADDITION. WE BELIEVE- MANDATING ETCHING ENGRAVING- YOU KNOW THE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS PUT ON THE VEHICLE FOR AN AIR QUALITY IMPROVEMENT PURPOSE WE ARE CONCERNED NOT ALL DEALERS. THAT THE BILL APPLIES TO OUR MISTER SAMPSON'S MEMBERS. THEY'RE LESS SOPHISTICATED OPERATORS OUT THERE IN THE SPACE IN THE MANDATE THEM TO START PUNCHING HOLES. INTO CATTLE IT. IS NOT A GOOD THING WE PREFER WORD PHRASES LIKE CARMEN AND MARKING AND THE EXPLORATION OF OTHER APPROACHES TO THIS. IN ADDITION WE THINK THAT THE BILLS A LITTLE NARROW IN ITS APPLICATION WITH RESPECT TO SOLUTIONS- THE BUREAU OF AUTOMOTIVE REPAIR AS WELL AS MANY INSURANCE COMPANIES HAVE COME OUT WITH GUIDELINES FOR CONSUMERS TO HELP. DETER CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFT OBVIOUSLY VENN MARKING IS ONE OF THEIR- SOLUTIONS BUT THOSE PUT SALUTE. SO INCLUDE AFTERMARKET ARE PROTECTIVE DEVICES- MOTION SENSING ALARMS OTHER. OTHER TOOLS THAT THE CONSUMER CAN USE THAT ACTUALLY. EVENT THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER FROM BEING STOLEN IN THE FIRST PLACE NOT JUST PROVIDE A CHAIN OF EVIDENCE AFTER IT'S ALREADY BEEN STOLEN WE THINK THAT'S A WORTHWHILE DISCUSSION HAVE- AS THE BILL CONTINUES TO MOVE FORWARD AND AGAIN WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S TIME. AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING THE CONVERSATION THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THERE ARE WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HERE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WISHES TO SPEAK. IN OPPOSITION OF US THREE NINE EIGHT SIX. JINAN MODERATOR LET'S GO TO OUR PHONE LINES INTO AFTER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT AND OPPOSITION OUT SB NINE EIGHT SIX PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND THERE ARE NONE RIGHT WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS BY COMMITTEE MEMBER SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU I AM JUST HAD A FEW AND THIS SEEMS TO BE- CATALYTIC CONVERTER DAY. AND THIS IS A COMMITTEE. SO I DID HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- ARE THE ISSUES FROM THE OPPOSITION BEING ADDRESSED IS OUR WAY TO. I THINK THAT'S RIGHT- SINCE INTRODUCTION THE BILL WE HAVE BECOME AWARE THAT IS MORE CHALLENGING ON CERTAIN MODELS- TO ETCH. THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER YOU HAVE TO DISASSEMBLE AND REASSEMBLE AND I THINK THE OPPONENTS ARE CORRECTED SOMETIMES TAKES HOURS THE BILL CORRECT IN THAT- THIEVES. MOST LIKELY AREN'T GOING TO ATTACK A VEHICLE THAT REQUIRES YOU KNOW SEVERAL MINUTES OF NON OUR TO DISASSEMBLE AND SOLD US IN APPROPRIATIONS ORGAN AMEND THE BILL TO AMEND OUT. OF THOSE. THOSE MODELS. THAT DO NOT ALLOW FOR READY ACCESS THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER CORE SETS DEPEND UPON THE CHEER OF APPROPRIATIONS AND WHETHER HE OR NOT HE GREASE THAT ARE NOT. FEATURE TO- EVEN THOUGH I IS A CO AUTHOR JOIN- THE SECOND IS THIS JUST FOR. DEALERS OR DOES IT ALSO WOULD ALSO INCLUDE- CAPTURE INDIVIDUAL SELLERS JUST DEALERS OKAY AND THEN- THE THIRD QUESTION WAS. SO CURRENTLY FOR EXAMPLE- NGUYEN DEALERS ARE SELLING- AS A YOU KNOW A VEHICLE THAT'S BEEN IN M. ACCIDENT THEY'RE REQUIRED TO HAVE A- THE TITLE THAT SAYS IT SALVAGED AND SO IT'S UP TO THE BUYER TO MAKE THEIR OWN DETERMINATION ABOUT IF THEY WANT TO PURCHASE THE VEHICLE- IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION ABOUT MAYBE HAVING SOMETHING SIMILAR TO THAT FOR THIS- BECAUSE- I MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY. I GUESS THE QUESTION IS WHAT'S THE OUTCOME THAT YOU DON'T WANT PEOPLE TO PURCHASE CARS THAT HAVE A STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTER OR YOU DON'T WANT. IT SO BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IT'S HITTING THE PERSON IN THE MIDDLE WHO MAY BE KNOWINGLY OR UNKNOWINGLY RIGHT SELLING A VEHICLE THAT HAS A STOLEN. WHAT IS THE- SO FAR AS I KNOW THE STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ARE ARE NOT PLACED ON OTHER VEHICLES THEIR THEIR OWN FOR PURPOSES OF PRECIOUS METALS AND SO I THINK IT'S UNLIKELY THAT SOMEONE WOULD PURCHASE A VEHICLE THAT HAS A OF PREVIOUSLY STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTER WHICH WAS A FIX TO THAT VEHICLE. OKAY AND THEN THE LAST QUESTION IS- IT DOES SAY IN HERE THAT THE BILL WOULD INSTEAD I. WOULD INSTEAD OF PAYMENT BY CHECK REQUIRE PAYMENT BY ANY TRACEABLE MATH OTHER THING AXE SO- I WANT TO KNOW DOES THAT INCLUDE OR PRECLUDE DIGITAL CURRENCY- THAT'S A VERY GOOD QUESTION US. COM LONGER. I THINK WE HAVE A DRESS THAT UP TO THE EXTENT THE DIGITAL TUR CURRENCY CANNOT BE TRACED IT WOULD NOT BE A VALID FORM OF PAYMENT. BUT IT IT CAN BE SO THEN. SO JUST BECAUSE THAT SILENT DOESN'T MEAN IT PROHIBITS- THAT'S CORRECT BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET AROUND IT OUR FOLKS WHO STILL CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. THEN THEY SELL THEM TO A RECYCLER FOR EXAMPLE FOR CASH AND SO WE CAN'T IDENTIFY THOSE WHO'VE STOLEN OR THOSE ARE IN THE BUSINESS OF COLLECTING STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. THANK YOU THANK YOU ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS ARMED COMMITTEE. I HAVE ONE IN EACH HAS TO DO WITH THE FACT THAT AND I THINK THE NEW COLLAR CAR DEALERS PRESENTATION STATED THAT- THE NUMBERS ARE INJURED VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE CAR WHY SHOULDN'T MANUFACTURES JUST NOW START. ON THE PRODUCTION SIDE OF INCLUDING THE VIN NUMBER THAT WOULD BE A LOT SIMPLER THAN HAVING A CAR IT IS SIMPLE AND THEN ON THE DEALER'S SHOWROOM AND NOW HAVING TO HAVE TO. GO BACK IN AT THAT NUMBER AND NEW CAR DEALERS OR ALLIANCE CAN ANSWER THAT QUESTION. YEAH MISTER CHAIR HAPPY TO ADDRESS THAT THAT QUESTION. THAT WOULD. AS YOU KNOW WE HAVE- PRODUCTION FACILITIES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TRYING TO SUPPLY THE ENTIRE WORLD WITH CARS SOME OF THOSE ARE BUILT HERE IN CENTER. OVERSEAS SUMMER BILL PERVERSE AND SENT HERE- THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND OTHER COMPONENTS OF THE VEHICLE OR SOME OF THE LAST THINGS PUT ON THE VEHICLE BUT THERE BEFORE THEY'RE SHIPPED. AND WE DON'T KNOW WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO BE SHIPPED WHICH COUNTRY AND SO TO RETOOL ALL OF OUR PRODUCTION FACILITIES WOULD COST HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO STAMP THE YOU KNOW TO STAMP THE VAN ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND AS I PREVIOUSLY STATED WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT POTENTIAL DAMAGE TO CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND THEIR AIR QUALITY IMPACT IF THEY ARE STAMPED OR ENGRAVED LASTLY- YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THE COMMITTEE TO KEEP IN MIND IS THIS YOU KNOW IF THAT WERE. A SALUTE OF. LOVINS AS WE CONTINUE TO MARCH TOWARDS THE ADOPTION OF THE A. R. P.'S- ADVANCED CLEAN CARS TO RULE- BY TWENTY THIRTY FIVE AND STAGES YOU KNOW EARNS HIS THROUGHOUT- WE WILL BE SELLING MORE ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES IN THE STATE WHICH DON'T HAVE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS. GOT A- ALL RIGHT. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS KERN TINA TURNER- BURKE CENTER FOR INTERNAL TALK CLOSE UP THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF TO ADDRESS THE QUESTION. SOLUTION IT WOULD BE BEST IF THE MANUFACTURERS ACTUALLY HAD THE NUMBER ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER THE POINT OF MANUFACTURE WE DON'T HAVE JURISDICTION THOUGH TO- REQUIRE THAT MANUFACTURERS DO SO- THE POINT'S WELL TAKEN THAT ULTIMATELY PRESS WILL ALL HAVE ELECTRIC VEHICLES WITHOUT THAT'S SEVERAL YEARS FROM NOW IN THE MEANTIME THIS IS AN EPIDEMIC THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED- AND FOR ALL THOSE REASONS I URGE A NO VOTE AND PORTANTINO. NO I THINK MY COLLEAGUE SAID IT WELL THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED- THESE PARTS ARE BEING SOLD FOR THE PRECIOUS METALS AND IF WE CAN DETER THAT- A LOT OF FOLKS TO GO OUT A LOT OF FOLKS TO GO OUT INTO THEIR JOB. AND CARS IN OPERABLE WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO WORK CONSERVE RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL. ALL RIGHT AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR MOTION THAT WOULD DO PASSED TO APPROPRIATIONS UNDERSTANDING THAT AMENDMENTS WILL BE TAKEN IN APPROPRIATIONS TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED BY. NEW CAR DEALERS. THIS MOVE BY SENATOR SCANNER COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON S. B. NINE H. SIX. SB EIGHT NINE SYSTEM OKAY SB NINE EIGHT SIX DO PASSED HER PREPARATIONS BRADFORD.

THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M PRESENTING SP NINE OH SIX WHICH WILL REQUIRE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES FIREARM STORAGE IN THEIR ANNUAL NOTIFICATION PROVIDED TO PARENTS AND GUARDIANS AS THE AUTHOR OF SOME OF THE SAFE STORAGE LEGISLATION IT'S IMPORTANT. THAT FAMILIES AT HOME KNOW THE RESPONSIBILITIES WITH THEIR FIREARMS- THIS WILL INCREASE ACCOUNTABILITY IN AWARENESS OF SAFETY PRECAUTIONS TO HELP KEEP OUR CHILDREN SAFE. WILL ALSO ALLOW CONCERNED- SCHOOL PERSONNEL TO ACT ON A PERCEIVED FIREARM THREAT. BY ALERTING SCHOOL CAMPUS LAW ENFORCEMENT OR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT TO INVESTIGATE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT CREDIBLE THREATS- WHICH WILL PRIORITIZE THE SAFETY OF IN STUDENTS- TO INSURE WHEN THEY GO TO SCHOOL WHEN TEACHERS GO TO SCHOOL WHEN STAFF GO TO SCHOOL WHEN ADMINISTRATORS GO TO SCHOOL. THEY COME HOME WE SAW IN MICHIGAN WHEN A SCHOOL RECEIVED NOTICE OF A CREDIBLE THREAT AND THEN THERE WAS INACTION ON THE PART OF THE ADMINISTRATORS WE SAW THE TRAGEDY TOOK AS ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES IN THE PRIOR COMMITTEE MENTIONED- WE DON'T EVER WANT TO READ IN THE PAPER AND SAY WE WISH WE COULD HAVE DONE MORE WE WISH WE COULD HAVE SAVED A LIFE. AND SO WITH THIS BILL DOES IS SAY WHEN YOU HAVE THE INFORMATION OF A CREDIBLE THREAT SIT ON IT. DON'T SIT ON EXCUSE ME- ACT UPON IT- IT'S- REASONABLE THAT SOME PEOPLE MIGHT HESITATE- AN ADMINISTRATOR MIGHT SAY WE KNOW THIS WON'T HAPPEN HERE. OR WHAT HAPPENS IF FOR WRONG WHAT WE WHAT WE ANGER APPARENT IF WE'RE WRONG AND SO WHAT I WANNA DO IS TAKE THAT OFF THE TABLE AND SAY YOU KNOW WHAT. WHEN THAT EIGHTEEN YOUR POST THAT THREAT ON SOCIAL MEDIA OR TALK ABOUT IT WITH THEIR FRIENDS AND YOU KNOW IT'S REAL.

QUIRK-SILVA THREATS ON ACTUAL EVIDENCE THAT THERE REALLY IS A THREAT. THE SECOND STANDARD FOR ONE STUDENT BEHAVIOR IS CLASSIFIED AS A THREAT BECAUSE THE THREAT REMAINS VERY BROAD GOING FAR BEYOND BEHAVIORS THAT INDICATE THAT YOU CAN FIND A LOT VIOLENT ACTS. FIREMAN'S REPORTING OF THREATS MUST ALL FOCUS ON OUR PACKED IN ACTUAL. NOT KIND OF EXPRESS THAT ARE TYPICAL OF YOUNG PEOPLE STRUGGLING WITH DIFFICULT EMOTIONS. HAVE NO INTENT WHATSOEVER TO HARM ANYONE. OTHERWISE WE KNOW WHO WILL SUFFER MOST. FROM FROM UNNECESSARY INTERACTION WITH BOND. AND THAT IT DIDN'T OF COLOR AND STUDENTS WITH DISABILITIES. THIRD WORLD NEED TO RETAIN INTEREST THE LIST TO. WHETHER OR NOT LAW ENFORCEMENT INVOLVED IS THE RIGHT RESPONSE AND THE BEST WAY TO PREVENT FILE. WE HOPE THAT SCHOOLS WILL BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY STUDENTS WHO NEED HELP EARLY BEFORE THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE RISK OF VIOLENCE. AND APPROPRIATE SUPPORT. BETTER TO PREVENT VIOLENCE DONNELLAN PORTION INVESTIGATION ONE. IT IS ESSENTIAL THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO ADEQUATE MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS. AND THOSE RESOURCES ARE ESSENTIAL TO PREVENTING VIOLENCE IN OUR SCHOOLS SCHOOLS SHOULD KNOW THAT THEY CAN CHOOSE THOSE TOOLS. WHEN BACK LEFT THE PROGRAM. I'M FINALLY WE ARE CAN THAT THE GROUND ABSOLUTE IMMUNITY TO SCHOOL OFFICIALS IS OVERBROAD AND WOULD LIKE TO KEEP TO WITH THE SENATOR AND HIS STAFF TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL FOCUSES ON TRUE TRAP. AGAINST SCHOOL PRESSURE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU NOW WILL MOVE TO GENERATE. MODERATORS JOHN REED AVAILABLE. MODERATOR. ONE MOMENT WHILE WE'RE LOOKING ONE MOMENT. NO I DO NOT SEE GENERAL READ. ALL RIGHT WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ONE MORE TIME IS THERE ANY WITNESSES HERE IN PERSON WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO. SB NINE OH FOUR. NONSECTION WELCOME TO USERS MORE SO I JUST IT'S FINE WRITER- MY NAME IS VERONICA I'M FROM YUBA COUNTY AND I OPPOSE S. B. NINE SIX. RIGHT NOW WILL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS REGARDING S. B. NINE OH SIX ZERO COMMA. THE MESSAGE CARE I'VE JUST HAD A FEW. YEAH THIS ONE AS WELL SO I'M- IS IT EXCLUSIVE JUST TO FIRE ARMS. ARE YOU SAID- MASS CASUALTIES AND- THREAT OF MASS CASUALTY INCIDENTS SO I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT IS AND THERE'S BEEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT- IN IN THE ANALYSIS OF TALKS ABOUT GUNS SO I DIDN'T KNOW IF THERE WAS IF IT WAS- ONLY EXCLUSIVE TO CASUALTIES THAT CAN HAPPEN BECAUSE OF. THE USE OF FIREARMS OR DOES IT ALSO INCLUDE- YOU KNOW SELLING DRUGS THAT COULD CAUSE MASS CASUALTIES IF FOLKS ARE YOU KNOW. WE'RE VERY FOCUSED ON VIOLENT CREDIBLE THREAT I MEAN IF THERE IS A TEENAGER ON FACEBOOK. MAKING A THREAT. OF VIOLENCE AGAINST THEIR PEERS ARE AGAINST THEIR TEACHER AGAINST THE COUNSELOR- THEY DON'T OFTEN IDENTIFY WHICH WEAPON OF CHOICE THEY'RE GOING TO BE. COMING TO SCHOOL WITH BUT IT'S ABOUT VIOLENT THREATS IT'S NOT ABOUT. FRANKLY DRUGS OR ALCOHOL OR THOSE OTHER. SOCIAL THINGS THAT'S NOT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL THIS IS A N. AND AGAIN WE KNOW AND I THINK I MAY BE WRONG WHEN 90% OF THESE INSTANCES THERE HAS BEEN SOME. FREE WARNING SOME PRECURSOR- AND IN 67% OF THESE INSTANCES THE WEAPONS COME FROM THE HOME- SO. THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT VIOLENT. THREAT TO THE SAFETY OF A SCHOOL- AND AGAIN I GO BACK TO MICHIGAN WHERE THAT SCHOOL WAS ALERTED TO THE INTENT OF THAT SHOOTER. AND DID NOTHING THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT. SO IN THIS INSTANCE- ALSO I IN VIEW YOU IF IT'S OKAY TO IF YOU HAVE- SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE ARE STILL BEING SORT OF A DISCUSS- BUT I WILL SAY THAT EIGHTY I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW A THREAT IS DEEMED CREDIT CREDIBLE WHOIN THIS INSTANCE WOULD BE MAKING THAT DETERMINATION IS THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT THAT MAY NOT KNOW THAT CHILDREN. THEN WHICH- HOW THEY'RE BEHAVING IN SCHOOL IS AT THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS- AND THEN- IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT IS NOT CREDIBLE RIGHT YOU STILL GONE THROUGH THIS INVESTIGATION YOU HAVE TARGETED PEOPLE YOUNG KIDS YOU HAVE CALLED THEM YOU'VE DONE ALL OF THIS AND SO THEN WHEN THAT HAPPENS- THERE'S A- SIMPLE SITUATION WHERE YOU SORT OF CREATED A SCAPEGOAT OUT OF A CHILD. NGUYEN IN THE INSTANCE THE THREAT IS NOT DEEMED CREDIBLE CREDIBLE OR MAYBE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN TAKEN IT TURNS OUT THAT IT WAS FALSE- I AM MOST CURIOUS ABOUT SORT OF THE CONSEQUENCES IN AFTER EFFECTS. OF THAT BECAUSE I AM CONCERNED ABOUT SORT OF SPECULATIVE WHICH ON. THAT COULD THEN HAPPEN UNDER THE AUSPICES OF THE BILL. SO IF. THE FOLKS OUT OF SCHOOL DETERMINE IT NOT TO BE A CREDIBLE THREAT. I'M NOT GOING TO INVESTIGATE. SO THAT'S THE WHOLE CRUX OF IT. IF IT'S A CREDIBLE THREAT AND LET ME BACK UP RIGHT NOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE AUTHORITY. TO DO THE INVESTIGATION WERE NOT CHANGING ANY RIGHTS PRIVILEGES ARE AUTHORITIES OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS- THEY ALREADY CAN DO THIS AND IT IS A LOWER STANDARD ALREADY IN CALIFORNIA LAW THEN PROBABLY BECAUSE WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANY OF THAT. WHAT WE'RE SAYING IS JUST LIKE A- MANDATORY REPORTER- PSYCHOLOGIST OR PSYCHIATRIST IN A- ABUSE CASE WHEN THAT PERSON RECEIVES THE INFORMATION THAT. THEY'RE SOMETHING THAT NEEDS TO BE REPORTED THEY'RE THEY'RE MANDATED TO DO IT THAT'S THE SAME PRINCIPLE HERE WE'RE NOT TRYING TO PROFILE ANYBODY WE'RE NOT TRYING TO- TO GO AFTER THINGS THAT ARE UNNECESSARY OR NOT GERMANE OR NOT ADDED TO A VIOLENT THREAT- WE HAVE NARROWED. SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS BASED ON THE FEEDBACK WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS BUT THE POINT IS IF USE PREVENT A VIOLENT THREAT FROM HAPPENING IF YOU'VE PREVENTIVE VIOLENT ACTION. THANK GOODNESS WE PREVENTED IT- IF THEY LOOK AT THIS INFORMATION AND THEY DETERMINED THAT IT'S NOT A CREDIBLE THREAT AND THEY DON'T TAKE IT TO THE NEXT STEP THAT'S GOOD BUT IF THEY DETERMINE IT'S A VIOLENT THREAT AND THEY INVESTIGATED AND WE PREVENT SOMETHING. YOU CAN'T THEN SAY WELL THEY PREVENTED IT THEREFORE. THERE WAS NO. BENEFIT AND SO THAT'S THE SWEET SPOT WE'RE TRYING TO HIT- AND WILL CONTINUE TO REFINE IT AS APPROPRIATELY AND WE HAVE MADE WE'VE TAKEN A NUMBER OF- SUGGESTIONS. AND ACCESS THE SCHOOL ADMINISTRATORS- WE'VE BEEN TALKING WITH THE ACLU. BUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS. HAVE A SITUATION WHERE WE DON'T WAKE UP AFTER A MASS SHOOTING AND SAY I WISH WE COULD HAVE. WERE WE SHOULD HAVE. AND NOT. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS WILL WE EVER MAKE EVERYBODY HAPPY OF COURSE THERE'S NEVER GOING TO BE A BILL. ON THE SUBJECT OF THIS SENSITIVITY. THAT EVERYBODY GETS EXACTLY WHAT THEY WANT. BECAUSE THERE ARE SOME FUNDAMENTAL DIFFERENCES- AS FAR AS THE MENTAL HEALTH COMPONENT I HAVE ANOTHER BILL TO ACTUALLY EXPAND. MENTAL HEALTH- WELL THE CENTERS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS A GERMANE. ASPECT OF IT WE SHOULD BE WE SHOULD BE ENGAGING IN THE MENTAL HEALTH AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS AS WELL. BUT WE SHOULD NOT LET THAT TEENAGER WHO HAS ACCESS TO AN ASSAULT RIFLE. WHO IS MADE A THRET ON SOCIAL MEDIA. COME TO SCHOOL AND CREATE MA'AM. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO PREVENT THANK YOU I THINK I AM AT A PRIOR COMMITTEE I AM SHARED A STORY WHICH I'M NOT GOING TO GO BACK INTO ABOUT AN INSTANCE AT A SCHOOL- WHERE THERE WERE TWO INCIDENTS- AND- YOU KNOW. I DON'T TALK ABOUT IT TOO MUCH IN DEPTH BECAUSE THERE'S MINOR IS INVOLVED- IN TRYING TO SUPPORT THEIR PRIVACY BUT THERE. WERE INCONSISTENCIES WHICH HAPPENED WITH HOW DOES SCHOOL INTERPRETED THE THREATS THAT WERE MADE AND WHAT WAS DONE- AND AT THE END OF THE DAY- IT'S A BALANCE BETWEEN SAFETY. AND PRIVACY- AND ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE NOT TIPPING THE SCALES- OF INTRUSION- AND MAKING SURE THAT- SCHOOLS REMAIN SCHOOLS. YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO GO AND LEARN- AND SO I JUST AND ALWAYS- SENSITIVE TO. THE INCREMENTAL PUSH TO KIND OF. PRISON EYES- SCHOOLS. WITH THE ACCESS THAT WE OFFER TO LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN THERE'S SO MUCH SUBJECTIVITY THAT'S INCLUDED IN- DECIDING IF THREATS ARE CREDIBLE AND ALSO TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION. THE GROWTH THAT STILL HAS TO HAPPEN WITH YOUNG PEOPLE- SO THOSE ARE WHY ASK BECAUSE I WAS JUST REALLY INTRIGUED BY SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT THE OPPOSITION OFFERED UP. THANK YOU. YOUR ANY OTHER CONCERNS OR QUESTIONS WAS COMMITTEE. I'M INTO- THAT- THEY'RE STILL FOLKS ONLINE WHICH IS SPEAKING OPPOSITION EVEN THOUGH IT ASKS CLEARLY IF THERE WERE WILL GO BACK TO THE MODERATE AND GIVE THEM OPPORTUNITIES. STATER NAME IN A POSITION.

AND WE HAVE HEARD THAT THAT. NOBODY ELSE Q. YOU AND WE'LL COME BACK TO THE COMMISSIONER SKINNER. THE CHAIR SO THIS. ONE IT IS WE WILL BE. I COMPLETELY APPRECIATE AND WE KNOW THAT THEIR BEEN INCIDENTS THAT HAD. AN AUTHORITY WHERE THERE WAS THE SCHOOL OR LAW ENFORCEMENT OR THE PARENT ACTED. THAT WE WOULD HAVE PREVENTED THE SHOOTING SO WE KNOW THAT. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW. THAT SOME OF THE CHILDREN THAT MAKE SUCH THREATS ARE REALLY HAVE MIDDLE. ILLNESS PROBLEMS AND NOW SOME OF THE SHOOTERS THE KIDS THAT ACTUALLY SHOOT TO DO SO I MEAN THIS IS A FINE. WE ALSO KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW WHILE. R. WE'VE BECOME MORE. MUCH MORE AWARE OF THIS FINE LINE BETWEEN THE ROLE OF LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE ACTIONS OF THOSE WHO ARE IN A DESPERATE MENTAL HEALTH STATE AND MAYBE IT'LL NET MAYBE IT'S JUST NOT EVER GOING TO BE AT THE PLACE WHERE IT IS REALLY THE APPROPRIATE ENTITY TO DEAL WITH AND WE HAVE TOOLS NOW THINGS LIKE BE A RED FLAG LOWERED THE GUN VIOLENCE RESTRAINING ORDER WHICH- AND OFF I FELT CONFIDENT THAT THE INVOLVEMENT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT WOULD IT WOULD RESULT IN SOMETHING LIKE THAT. WHERE BUT THE FAMILY BECAUSE IN MY OPINION AND I'M SURE THOSE WHO ARE- YOU KNOW THOSE AFFILIATED WITH THE NRA AND SUCH NOW FOR IT WOULD NOT AGREE WITH ME BUT I FEEL LIKE. WITH THERE'S A KID MAKING CREDIBLE THREATS- THAT'S A RED FLAG SHOULD BE PUT ON THE WHOLE FAMILY BECAUSE THERE SHOULD BE A GUN IN THE HOUSE THERE'S A GUN IN THE HOUSE THE KID MIGHT USE IT REGARDLESS OF THAT YOU KNOW WHAT THE- WHAT'S GOING ON IN THAT. AND I RATHER SEE TOOLS LIKE THAT USE. THEN THE TYPE OF TOOLS THAT RESULT IN CRIMINALIZING THE CHILD OR- ANYWAY SO WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH IS THAT. WELL I WANT I TOTALLY APPRECIATE- CENTER PORTANTINO YOUR INTENTION THAT WE ARE WE WANT WE WANT TO PREVENT THE SCHOOL SHOOTINGS WE WANT TAKE THE THREATS CREDIBLY. BUT WE ALSO HAVE THIS FINE LINE OF HOW THESE CHILDREN ARE TREATED WHAT'S THE CONSEQUENCE AND WHAT THAT YOU KNOW AFTER IF IT'S LAW ENFORCEMENT BECAUSE IT'S NOT ALWAYS. NEITHER THE SCHOOL OR LAW ENFORCEMENT ALWAYS HAS EITHER. ONE AND SO I'M I'M NOT GOING TO OPPOSE THE BILL I WILL SUPPORT THE BILL BUT I AND I DON'T KNOW IF I WERE IN YOUR POSITION CHAIR AS BEING FOREIGN CARE WHAT TYPE OF AMENDMENT MIGHT HELP WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH BUT THAT IS WHAT I'M STRUGGLING. SO AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT KIND OF CONVERSATIONS HAPPEN WHETHER THERE'S ANY WAY TO. BUT ANYWAY. THANK YOU IF I COULD COMMENT RIGHT HERE AT THE CONVERSATIONS HAVE BEEN CONTINUOUS BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE TRYING TO ADDRESS A PROBLEM AND WE'RE TRYING TO GET IT RIGHT- I CAN'T TELL YOU WHAT THE FINAL VERSION IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE- BUT WE ARE HAVING PRODUCTIVE- FRANKLY I THINK ONE OF THE PROVISIONS THAT'S BEEN TAKEN OUT OF THE BILL WHICH IS TO KNOW WHAT. ACTUAL WEAPONS WERE AVAILABLE IN THE HOUSEHOLD I THINK MAYBE THERE'S EVEN A STRONGER BILL BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT WAS TWO POINT TWO FAR FOR SOME FOLKS ROM BUT WE'RE TRYING TO HIT THE SWEET SPOT I MEAN I THINK THAT THE QUESTION YOU'RE ASKING IS THE- BUT WE DO. THAT THE SHOOTERS MAKE IT KNOWN THEY MAKE THEIR INTENT KNOWN. WE KNOW THEY HAVE ACCESS TO A WEAPON WHEN THEY PROBABLY SHOULDN'T- AND WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO EMPOWER THE DISTRICT. TO DEAL WITH IT APPROPRIATELY AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. SO I APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT TODAY AND WILL KEEP YOU APPRISED OF HOW IT IF IT OBVIOUSLY HOPEFULLY MOOSE IT CONTINUES TO MOVE. BUT IT'S THE RIGHT QUESTION. QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SIMILAR TO A BOOK- SOME IMPORTANT TO KNOW. NO WE'VE BEEN HAVING CONVERSATIONS AND I'VE JUST BEEN VERY CONFLICTED BUT- HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS THE CONCERN THAT- FIRST OF ALL DO YOU BELIEVE THAT THERE HAS BEEN A NEEDING CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESS THE SITUATIONS BECAUSE JUST COMING FROM MARK MY LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICT. I KNOW THAT IF THERE'S EVER BEEN IS WHEN THERE WAS A SUSPICION OF EIGHTY SOMEONE HAVING A GUN OR I THINK IT WAS A GUN- AT THAT TIME. THE SCHOOL ACTED SWIFTLY IN ADDRESSING THE CONCERN. I'M JUST KIND OF CURIOUS AS TO I MEAN I KNOW WHAT THE MOTIVATION IS YOU WANT TO PREVENT THAT WHAT IS- COMPELS YOU TO THINK THAT WE DON'T ALREADY HAVE SOMETHING LOCALLY THROUGH OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA. YOUR CONCERN YOU- MISSING QUITE A BIT BUT- WHAT COMPELS YOU TO THINK THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A NEED FOR SUCH A BILL IN CALIFORNIA THAT ARE SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CALIFORNIA BEING A SENSITIVE AS WE ARE WITH. VARIOUS ISSUES HERE IN IN CALIFORNIA. THAT WE ACTUALLY NEED THIS TYPE OF BUILT TO BE IN PLACE THAT- THAT ADDRESSES THE ISSUE THAT WE MAY OR MAY NOT ACTUALLY NEED BECAUSE OF THE PROTOCOLS ARE ALREADY IN PLACE IN LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS. TWO THINGS FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT. TAKE CREDIBLE THREATS I SERIOUSLY IS THE ONE YOU'RE YOU'RE REFERENCING. FRANK FOR THE BE NO IMPACT ON THAT SCHOOL DISTRICT BECAUSE- THEY GET A THREAT NAY THEY ACT UPON BUT I HAVE HEARD FROM OTHER DISTRICTS WHERE. THEY WRESTLE WITH. DO WE DO WE INVESTIGATE DON'T WE INVESTIGATE DOES THIS HAPPEN HERE AND I HAVE I HAVE BEEN MADE AWARE OF SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE WRESTLED WITH THIS ISSUE- I CAN'T NAME THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS BECAUSE I'M IN CONFIDENCE ON ON SOME OF THAT STUFF- BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT WE'VE HAD. THE SHOOTINGS IN CALIFORNIA- AND SO. YOU NEVER KNOW WHEN YOU PREVENT SOMETHING. BECAUSE YOU DON'T KNOW. IF THAT ACTUALLY LEADS TO A PREVENTION BUT WE KNOW THIS WELL. AND SO THAT'S SORT OF. GETTING OUT OF FROM BOTH SIDES THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE PROACTIVE. WE'RE GOING TO SEE NO EFFECT THE DISTRICTS THAT ARE. ONLY GOING TO BE FORCED TO DO SOMETHING. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE AND I AM USING MICHIGAN BECAUSE THAT'S THE MOST RECENT EXAMPLE WHERE THEY RECEIVED A CREDIBLE THREAT SAT ON IT AND THEN THERE WAS A TRAGEDY. AND THEN A FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD BE TO YOUR COMMENTS. DO YOU FEEL THAT IT WOULD BE. SINCE MANY OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT ARE ACTING IN CONFIDENCE OR SPEAKING-CONFIDENCE DO YOU THINK THAT WE SHOULD PROCEED WITH DATA COLLECTION TO SEE IF THERE IS SUCH A NEED. IDON'T WANT TO WAIT ANOTHER YEAR AND HAVE ANOTHER TRAGEDY. THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL I DON'T WANT TO READ SIX MONTHS FROM NOW THAT WE COULD HAVE DONE SOMETHING AND A TEENAGER WAS ON SOCIAL MEDIA TALKING ABOUT. A VIOLENT DEADLY THREAT AND INACTION LED TO SOMEBODY DYING. AND SO. I DON'T WANT TO LET MORE TIME I WANT TO GET THIS IN THE GOVERNOR'S DESK THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE HOPEFULLY GET A SIGNATURE AND MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THIS IN PLACE GOING FORWARD. BECAUSE THE WORLD IS MORE COMPLICATED THAN EVER BEFORE THE PRESENCE OF GUNS. IS MORE PREVALENT THAN EVER BEFORE THE UNREST IS THERE- AND I JUST DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT ANOTHER TRAGEDY. OR SEE ANOTHER PHOTO. OR HAVE ANOTHER COLUMBINE. I JUST DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT. IT'S JUST IT'S JUST IT'S JUST TOO HEARTBREAKING I DON'T WANT TO EVER MAKE A QUOTE AND SEND MY PRAYERS AND THOUGHTS AND WELL WISHES TO A FAMILY MEMBER THAT HAS TO DEAL WITH THIS WHEN WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY AS THE LEGISLATURE TO PUT IN PLACE SOMETHING. TO PREVENT IT. SORRY KEEP MAKING REALLY GOOD POINTS HE MAKES ME THINK ABOUT A FOLLOW UP QUESTIONS I APOLOGIZE SO. ANOTHER FOLLOW UP QUESTION WOULD BE- FOR THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT YOU SAY THAT WOULD BE HESITANT WOULD NOT ACT AND PUT IN PERIL SCHOOL CHILDREN AND-STAFF AND SO FORTH- SPEAKING AS A FORMER SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER. I HAVE TO SAY THAT I WOULD BE INCREDIBLY- HESITANT NOT TO ACT ON IT ON A ON A THREAD WERE A CREDIBLE THREAT- JUST BECAUSE OF SAFETY- PROTOCOL OR SAFETY THREAT. THE LIABILITY BEHIND THAT- WOULD BE HORRIBLE AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND- AND ADMINISTRATORS AND I'M NOT SURE IF THAT IN IN GOOD ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICE ANYBODY WOULD WANT THAT LIABILITY UPON THEMSELVES- SO JUST ON THAT. THAT IDEA THAT'S RIGHT ESPECIALLY CALIFORNIA AND THE THOUGHT THAT UNDER MY WATCH. ANY STUDENT WOULD BE HARMED OR ANY STAFF MEMBER WOULD BE HEART HARM IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT WOULD EVER NOT TAKE A THREAT SERIOUSLY AND THAT'S JUST MY PERSONAL OPINION I JUST WANT THAT FOR THE RECORD- IN IN IN ADDRESSING YOUR COMMENTS. THAT FROM THE CONVERSATIONS THAT I'VE HAD MANY MANY ADMINISTRATORS. THEY TAKE THEIR THEIR THEIR RESPONSIBILITY TO OVERSEE THE SAFETY OF THEIR SCHOOLS. VERY VERY- SERIOUSLY ON ON MANY LEVELS OF COURSE BECAUSE THEY ARE YOUR- THEY'RE THE ONES YOUR RESPONSE WITH LIKE A PARENT. YOU KNOW OVERSEEING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN SO- I JUST WANTED TO PUT THAT ON THERE BECAUSE TO INFER THAT THEY WOULDN'T I JUST. HAVE A HARD TIME THINKING THAT THEY WOULD NOT. AND AGAIN IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT ARE AS PROACTIVE AS AS YOU DESCRIBE AND RESPONSIBLE. THEY ALREADY HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO THE SEARCH TO DO THE INVESTIGATION- SO THEY'LL SEE NO NET EFFECT. FROM THIS BUT THE DISTRICT THAT. MAY BE PRONE TO INACTION WILL. AND IF YOU WANT MISTER CHAIR I RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL OUR- ANY OTHER QUESTIONS CONCERNS CENTERS CAN. IT'S BEEN MOVE A SEVENTY SKINNER- WE HAVE AN AMENDMENT IS CONCERNS IN THEIR- FOLLOWING LARGER WHAT SENATOR SKINNER STATED I THINK THE INTENTION OF BUT I'M ALSO FEARFUL OF. IMPACTING PRIOR LOWER INCOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND HAVING MORE CALLS ON IN IN THOSE COMMUNITIES WORDS IN A FLUENT COMMUNITIES YOU KNOW I THINK. THE THEY HAVE ACCESS TO MORE GUNS AND I'M PRETTY SURE THAT INFORMATION WILL BE PROBABLY STE SUPPRESSED AND FIND A WAY TO NOT TARGET THEM AND NOT SEE THEM AS A THREAT AS MUCH AS YOU WOULD SEE. LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES- BECAUSE WE SEE IT AND I HAVE A BILL RIGHT NOW I TRIED TO DE ESCALATE REPORTING ON INCIDENTS ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES AND GIVING A MINIATURE GREATER AUTHORITY. TO DECIDE WHEN TO REPORT A SITUATION VERSUS NOT SO JUST CURIOUS ON YOUR. HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT BECAUSE I THINK THERE WILL BE SOME BIASES HERE AND HOW THIS IS. AN ACTIVE IT IS TO PUT THE PAST. I ACTUALLY THINK IT'S GOING TO BE THE OPPOSITE I THINK I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE. MORE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THE SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE. BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S WHERE THE GREATER FEAR OF ACTION COMES OR INACTION COMES- AND- AGAIN WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT PROFILING WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT TARGETING ANYBODY WE'RE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. DEFINING WHAT A CREDIBLE THREAT IS AN ACTING UPON IT SO IT'S COUNTERINTUITIVE MISTER CHAIRMAN I THINK YOU'RE GONNA SEE A GREATER IMPACT OF THIS BILL- ON SUBURBAN COMMUNITIES WHERE YOU KNOW HOW REPRESENT URBAN AND SUBURBAN COMMITTEE. WHERE THE THAT WON'T HAPPEN HERE. IS MUCH MORE PREVALENT AND I THINK THAT'S WHY THIS IS GOING TO HAVE MORE OF A DRAMATIC IMPACT ON THOSE COMMUNITIES THAN THE URBAN COMMUNITIES. THAT'S DESPITE MY AGAIN THAT'S AN EMPIRICAL OPINION. BUT I YOU'RE AGAIN YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT% QUESTION. YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON THE DEFINITION TO MAKE SURE WE GO AFTER IT THE RIGHT WAY. BUT I THINK THIS IS GOING TO HAVE A GREATER EFFECT- IN THOSE COMMUNITIES NOT NOT THE ONES THAT YOU'RE YOU'RE REFERENCING IN MY OPINION- WHICH I CLOSE. WITH THAT THAT YOU KNOW YOUR STAFF HAS BEEN GREAT AS WE MOVE THIS FROM ONE COMMITTED TO THAN OTHERS TO PROCESS THE IMAGE THAT WE TOOK IN IN EDUCATION TO GET IT TO WHERE WE'RE AT TODAY AND I WOULD RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE AND- OBVIOUSLY IF THE CHAIR. ONCE HAVE CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS- I'M OPEN TO THOSE IF THERE'S AND YOUR COMMITTEE IF YOU HAVE. ANY THOUGHTS MOVING FORWARD- THIS IS TOO IMPORTANT NOT TO CONTINUE TO GET IT THROUGH SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NOT. THANK YOU. CAN SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR SKINNER WE HAVE DO PASS APPROPRIATIONS ON S. B. NINE OH SIX. PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. REFEREE ARE. NOT VOTING. THE MEASURE HAS TO GO THROUGH THE ROLE OPEN FORUMS MEMBERS THANK YOU. OBSCENITY JONES YES TO MEASURES YOU HAVE SB NINE NINETEEN INDUSTRY THIRTEEN SIXTY FIVE. WE'LL START WITH NINE NINETEEN. GOOD MORNING CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AS SOMEBODY MENTIONED EARLIER IT'S CATALYTIC CONVERTER DAY WE HAD THIS DAY LAST WEEK IN BNP- SO I WILL BE PRESENTING SB NINE NINETEEN WHICH WILL HELP COMBAT KELLY CONVERTER THEFTS WITH A HREE PRONGED APPROACH. FIRST THIS BILL REQUIRES NEW AND USED MOTOR VEHICLE DEALERS APPARENTLY MARKED THE VEHICLE IDENTIFICATION NUMBER ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER OF ANY VEHICLE BEFORE THEY SELL. THIS REQUIREMENT WILL READ WILL CREATE A WAY TO IDENTIFY CALIBERS. IF IT IS ILLEGALLY REMOVED FROM THE CAR. SECOND THIS BILL ALLOWS METAL RECYCLERS TO BY KELLY CONVERTERS ONLY IF THEY HAVE A CLEARLY VISIBLE AND UN TAMPERED BEEN ON THEM. RECYCLES IT ASO BE REQUIRED TO KEEP DETAILED RECORDS OF ALL SALES FROM BOTH BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS AND MAKE THOSE RECORDS AVAILABLE TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. THIRD THIS BILL ADDS FINES TO THE CURRENT. PENALTIES FOR CALIFORNIA THEFT AND MAKES IT EASIER TO ESTABLISH PROBABLE CAUSE FOR ARREST AND PROSECUTION. I KNOW ADDITIONAL PENALTIES TEND TO BE DIFFICULT IN THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE REALLY DO BELIEVE THIS PORTION IS CRUCIAL TO MAKING IT NOT WORK THE THIEVES TIME TO KEEP STEALING THESE DEVICES. SOME OF YOU MAY SEE MY VIDEO ON HOW EASY IT IS TO STEAL A CATALYTIC CONVERTER AND I WANTED TO SHOW THE COMMITTEE WITH A CATALOG NUMBER ACTUALLY LOOKS LIKE. THIS IS A- A REAL AFTERMARKET- KELLY CONVERTER. AND IT IS THE HOT COMMODITY BECAUSE OF THE PRECIOUS METALS. AND THE RISING COST OF THESE METALS CALIFORNIA IS THE NUMBER ONE STATE. IN THE NATION FOR CALCULATOR THEFTS. WITH EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DEATHS JUST LAST YEAR. THAT'S A 13100% INCREASE SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. WHAT IF CAN STILL CALIBURN UNDER TWO MINUTES AND MAKE A QUICK TWO HUNDRED FIFTY DOLLARS. THE VICTIMS OF THESE STEPS FACE UP TO FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS TO REPLACE THE CONVERTER AND THE LOSS OF THE VEHICLE WELL THERE'S GET FIXED AND WE'VE ALSO HEARD STORIES OF. THE VALUE OF REPLACING THE CALCULATOR ACTUALLY TOTALS THE VEHICLE AND MAKES IT NOT WORTHREPAIRING. THIS PROBLEM HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS AND DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SLOWING DOWN. THUS MAKING OUR ACTION TODAY ON THIS AND OTHER CATALYTIC CONVERTER MAJORS OF MOST IMPORTANCE. THIS BILL INCORPORATES A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TACKLE CATALYTIC CONVERTER THEFTS OF FROM ALL ANGLES. BUT I DO ALSO PLAN TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH MY COLLEAGUES TO SIMMER BILLS. AND WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND AN ADEQUATE SOLUTION. IF THIS BILL MOVES OUT COMMITTEE TODAY I'LL CONTINUE WORKING ON AMENDMENTS TO MITIGATE CONCERNS. ABOUT ADDITIONAL MANDATES ON BUSINESSES AND I'M COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THE STAKEHOLDERS TO FIND A SOLUTION THAT ADDRESSES THEIR CONCERNS AND SO PROTECT THE PUBLIC. FROM KELLY CONVERTER THEFT. ON THE PHONE TODAY HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL TO GIVE TESTIMONY THE FIRST DETECTIVE SAMPSON LEONARD. FROM THE CHILL VISTA POLICE DEPARTMENT. A PROPERTY CRIMES UNIT AND ALISON ATTY FROM THE FOR PERSONAL INSURANCE RATE. WHICH WITNESSES OUT AB TWO MINUTES EACH TO. THE TESTIMONY. DR MINOR. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS SAMSON LEONARD AND I'M DETECTIVE WITH THE TO THE TO POLICE DEPARTMENT. CATALYTIC CONVERTERS ALL CATS ARE THE PERFECT TARGET FOR THIEVES BECAUSE THEY'RE VALUABLE FOR SIMPLE THE STEEL IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE. AND UNFORTUNATELY HAS NO RECOURSE. ADDITIONAL STOLEN PROPERTY IS A CRIME AGAINST A PERSON. SO THAT A PERSON OR VICTIM THERE'S NO CRIME OFFICERS LOCATE CATS DURING TRAFFIC STOPS KNOW THAT THEIR STOLEN. BUT CAN'T PROVE IT THE SUSPECTS ARE NEVER HELD ACCOUNTABLE. SAN DIEGO COUNTY HAD OVER TWENTY FOUR HUNDRED CAT DEATHS REPORTED IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND DEBT IN MY CITY INCREASED BY SEVEN HUNDRED PERCENT. THIS YEAR'S LOOKING WORSE LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES WHERE PEOPLE PARK ON THE STREET OR UNSECURE LOTS ARE SPECIALLY VULNERABLE. AND I'VE MET VICTIMS LIKE CLAUDIAN JORGE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO REPAIR THEIR STOLEN CATS SO NOW THEY MAKE PAYMENTS ON CARS THAT THEY CAN'T USE.% PART OF THE PROBLEM IS THAT CURRENT LAW CREATED A BLACK MARKET THROUGH MINIMAL OVERSIGHT OF BUSINESS TO BUSINESS CAP TRANSACTIONS. SO IF I WERE TO FILE A FICTITIOUS BUSINESS NAME APPLICATION WITH THE COUNTY. I COULD SELL CATS TO RECYCLE IT NOW THE ONLY LOG MY BUSINESS THING. THE RECYCLERS ARE ACTING WITHIN THE LAW AND THEY CAN COMMITMENTS BECAUSE THE STOLEN CAT HAS ALREADY BEEN LAUNDERED BY THE PREVIOUS TRANSACTION BETWEEN THE TEETH IN MY SHOW BUSINESS. I EXPECTED A RECYCLING WAREHOUSE WHERE THOUSANDS OF CATS LOADED UP AWAITING SHIPMENT TO OHIO TO THE TRAIN DIE THESE CATS HAD JAGGED CUTS. BEING THE WIRES AND THEY WERE OBVIOUSLY STOLEN. HOW DO YOU PROVE. SOMETHING UNTRACEABLE STOLEN. THE LITTLE NINE ONE WILL MAKE STEVE TWICE REACHING FOR A STAR ALL. THAT'S WILL BE MARKED WITH VINCE MAKING THEM YOU. ALLOWING OFFICERS TO LOCATE VICTIMS MAKE ARRESTS AND RETURN STOLEN PROPERTY. SENATE NINE ONE NINE WILL ALLOW OFFICERS TO ACT BASED ON PROBABLE CAUSE ABSENT A READILY IDENTIFIABLE VICTIM. AND FINALLY THIS BILL WILL CLOSE LOOPHOLES AND AT REQUIREMENTS MAKING IT MORE DIFFICULT TO LAUNDER STOLEN CATS. AND THE BLACK MARKET WILL SLOW OVERNIGHT. OPPONENTS OF THIS BILL- COMPANIES WORRIED ABOUT INCREASED OVERHEAD. BUT SUPPORTERS ARE JORGE CLAUDIA AND EVERY CALIFORNIAN IMPACTED FRUSTRATED BY THIS CRIME. WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY RIGHT NOW TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT. IT LAW ENFORCEMENT A FIGHTING CHANCE THAT'S WHY I SUPPORT SENATE BILL NINE ONE NINE. THANK YOU. YOU NEXT WITNESS. THE MORNING SHERIN MEMBERS THIS IS ALTERNATING WITH THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION CALIFORNIA WE REPRESENT SEVEN OF THE STATE'S LARGEST HOME AND AUTO INSURER SB NINE ONE NINE RESPOND TO A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR OUR MEMBER COMPANIES IN CALIFORNIA CATALYTIC CONVERTER THAT MAKES IT NEARLY 30% OF ALL ON ME. THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS BEING STARK INCREASE OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS DESPITE THE FACT THAT CATALYTIC CONVERTERS INCLUDED IN VEHICLE IN NINETEEN SEVENTY SIX IT HAS ONLY BEEN SINCE TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN THAT THIS ISSUE HAS TAKEN THE FOREGROUND ONE ONE COMPANY NOTED THAT THE AVERAGE ANNUAL CATALYTIC CONVERTER THAT IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. FIFTY SEVEN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY ONE IT WAS THREE HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT THIS IS CONSISTENT ACROSS THE INDUSTRY ON AVERAGE OVER TWO MILLION HER COMPANY COSTING COMPANIES ARE ON AVERAGE TWENTY THREE MILLION EIGHT ALREADY CONTRACT ATTIC DRIVABILITY FOR THOSE WHO SELL STOLEN CATALYTIC CONVERTER WOULD BE A BENEFICIAL STEP TOWARD REDUCING THE NUMBER OF DEATHS ANNUALLY REDUCE STRAIN ON THE INDUSTRY AND ON CONSUMERS. INDUSTRY THAT PART. OF THE BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. MOSKOS ARIANNA SUPPORT THIS BILL. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT HERE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE IN NINETEEN NINE LET'S GO TO OUR PHONE LINES MODERATOR IF THERE'S WITNESSES WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB NINE ONE NINE. NOW IT'S TIME OF BILL SB NINE ONE NINE. PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. AND THERE'S NO ONE IN KILL. NOW WILL. GO TO OPPOSITION IN FOURTH IN THE SAME LISTED AS OPPOSITION AS YOU PREPARE. MORNING MISTER CHAIR AGAIN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE JOHN MOFFETT- IT WITH THE ALLIANCE FOR AUTOMOTIVE INNOVATION HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED ON ON THIS BILL AS WELL- WE APPRECIATE THE CONVERSATIONS WE'VE HAD WITH THE AUTHOR'S OFFICE I'LL MOVE THROUGH MY SAME ISSUES AS AS THE PREVIOUS BILL ON THIS ONE WE BELIEVE A PERMANENT MARKING NOT ETCHING AND ENGRAVING WITH BELIEVE THE BILLS TO BROAD THIS IS NOT A NEW CAR ISSUE THIS IS A USED CAR ISSUE. AND WE BELIEVE THAT OTHER PROTECTIVE MEASURES SHOULD ARE ARE BETTER APPROACHES- THAN THAN PERMANENT MARKING IN ACTUALLY PREVENTING THE THEFT OF CATALYTIC CONVERTERS- VERSUS JUST BEEN MARKING- FOR THOSE REASONS WE MAINTAIN OUR OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION. NEXT WITNESS IN OPPOSITION. THE MORNING CHAIR BRADFORD ON THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE SB NINE NINETEEN WHICH CREATES YET ANOTHER NEW CRIME SB NINE NINETEEN WOULD PERMIT THE FELONY ARREST AND PROSECUTION OF CALIFORNIANS FOR POSSESSING PERFECTLY LEGAL CARPARTS CATALYTIC CONVERTERS WITHOUT ANY EVIDENCE THAT THE PARTS WERE STOLEN OR ILLEGALLY POSSESSED. THIS COULD CAUSE INNOCENT CALIFORNIANS TO BE IMPRISONED UNDER EXISTING LAW A PERSON MAY BE PROSECUTED FOR STEALING CAR PARTS OR FOR ILLEGALLY POSSESSING STOLEN CAR PARTS UNDER VARYING CIRCUMSTANCES THE DEFENDANT COULD BE INCARCERATED UNDER THESE LAWS FOR UP TO A YEAR IN JAIL OR UP TO THREE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE VALUE OF THE PROPERTY. BEFORE ANY PERSON MAY BE PROSECUTED FOR THEFT- ORDER ILLEGAL POSSESSION EXISTING LAW ALSO REQUIRES PROOF THAT THE PART IN QUESTION WAS IN FACT STOLEN AND THE DEFENDANT KNEW IT TO BE STOLEN. CURRENT LAW CAREFULLY BALANCES THE COMMUNITY NEEDS WITH THE INDIVIDUAL CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS. SB NINE NINETEEN WOULD ALLOW PROSECUTION. WE OKAY. SENATOR SKINNER DID YOU TAKE SOME OF MY TWO MINUTES. SB NINE NINETEEN WOULD ALLOW PROSECUTION OF INNOCENT PEOPLE FOR POSSESSING ILLEGAL CAR PARK MOREOVER WITHOUT ANY EFFICACY OF AN INCREASED PENALTY VIS A VIS A CATALYTIC CONVERTER THIS BILL SEEKS TO IMPRISON PERSONS WHO POSSESS THOSE CAR PARTS WITHOUT PROOF THAT THE PART WAS STOLEN OR THE POSSESSION KNEW WHAT WAS STOLEN. WELL OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SUFFERING FROM MORE THEFT OF CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THERE ARE BETTER WAYS THAN THOSE PROPOSED IN SB NINE NINETEEN TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES FOR THESE REASONS WE URGE YOUR NO VOTE. THANK YOU WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION HERE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. SHE TO NAME AN ORGANIZATION. GOOD MORNING DEREK MORGAN WITH THE OTHER BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS RESPECTFULLY IN OPPOSITION THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. THE MORNING GREGORY FELT INITIATE JUSTICE RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION THANK YOU OPPOSITION OF US THREE NINE ONE NINE HERE IN THE ROOM. ENCINA MODERATOR LET'S GO TO OUR PHONE LINES AND- THERE'S INDIVIDUALS QUEUED UP WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT ABOUT THE VISION OF BILL SB NINE ONE NINE. NINE ZERO. MY MODEL SIXTY LINE IS OPEN WON ALL SIX. BE SURE ON THE HOUSE EIGHT YOU KNOW YOU CALIFORNIA ACTION IN OPPOSITION. AND THERE'S NO ONE LEFT THANK YOU. BACK TO THE COMMITTEE IS THERE ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SENATOR CALM WATER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. ARM SO I. ONE WAS JUST WONDERING IF MAYBE THERE WAS ANY INTEREST IN TRYING TO CONSOLIDATE SOME OF THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER BILLS SO THAT WE HAVE SOMETHING THAT'S A COMPREHENSIVE AND TRIES TO GET AT THE ISSUE THE A OR ISSUES AT HAND- BECAUSE I AGREE. THAT FOLKS WHO ARE DOING THIS ARE SCAVENGERS WHO WHO MAY BE DESPERATE WHO MAY BE POOR- WHO MAY BE LAZY WHO MAY BE CAVALIER WHATEVER IT IS THEY'RE CERTAINLY PREYING ON UNSUSPECTING VICTIMS. I THINK FOLKS THAT HAVE OLDER MODEL CARS WITH CATALYTIC CONVERTERS- YOU KNOW CAN'T REALLY AFFORD TO AND EVEN WORKING CLASS FOLKS CAN'T EVEN AFFORD TO GO THROUGH THE PROCESS OF REPLACING THEM. I THINK IT'S A HUGE ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE- HAVING TO REPLACE THEM AND WE SHOULD BE MOVING AWAY FROM IT. AND I DO AGREE WE SHOULD BE CREATING A CHILLING A FACT- ON THOSE WHO TRADE ON CATALYTIC CONVERTERS- AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT A WAY TO START THE BLACK MARKET. ABSOLUTELY TRUE. ARM AND- ALSO. YOU KNOW I HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT NOT NEEDING PROBABLE CAUSE TO MAKE AN ARREST I FEEL LIKE THAT'S A SLIPPERY SLOPE TOWARDS- POLICY THAT WE HAVEN'T REALLY SUPPORTED GENERALLY- IN THIS COMMITTEE AND YOU KNOW LEANING ON CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. SEEMS TO BE AS CAVALIER AS THE FOLKS WHO ARE OUT HERE YOU KNOW STEALING THESE CATALYTIC CONVERTERS AND I ALSO WONDER BECAUSE OF THE THAT LANGUAGE THAT'S ALSO IN THE BILL- NO CHEN CUFFS. IS THE INTENT TO GO AFTER. THE PERSON WHO STOLE IT. OR JUST THE PERSON WHO HAPPENS TO BE HOLDING THE PROPERTY. YOU KNOW AT THAT MOMENT IN TIME BECAUSE THAT PERSON COULD EQUALLY BE UNSUSPECTING AND I WOULD THINK WE WOULD WANT LANGUAGE OR BILLS THAT ARE GOING AFTER THE ACTUAL THIEVES OR EVEN THINK THE RING OF PEOPLE WHO ARE INVOLVED IN THIS KIND OF THEFT. BUT THE PROBABLE CAUSE NOT HAVING PROBABLE CAUSE IN THE CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE. YOU KNOW COULD LEAD LAW ENFORCEMENT TO SAY WELL WE'RE JUST GOING TO. TRY TO TEACH ALL THESE FOLKS A LESSON AND SO IF YOU HAPPEN TO HAVE IT IN YOUR POSSESSION RIGHT NOW EVEN THOUGH YOU DIDN'T STEAL IT BUT MAYBE IT WAS LIKE SECOND HAND THIRD HAND PURCHASE OR WHATEVER. THEN WE'RE GOING TO GO AFTER YOU WHICH ISN'T NECESSARILY ATTACKING B. THE ISSUE AT HAND WHICH IS HOW DO WE SORT OF START OF. THIS BLACK MARKET GO AFTER THOSE THAT ARE STEALING IT SO I DON'T KNOW IF THOSE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN HAPPENING WITH- THE COMMITTEE TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO LEAN INTO. THAT SWEET SPOT- AND ESSENTIALLY THIS IS MAYBE A LONG DIATRIBE TOWARDS ASKING IF YOU'VE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THE OPPOSITION. SURE SO. ON THE FIRST POINT OF CONSOLIDATING I THINK ALL OF IT I THERE'S THREE BILLS IN THE SENATE THAT FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THERE'S A BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY AT LEAST ONE BILL IN THE ASSEMBLY. MY STAFF HAS HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATE OFFICES THAT ARE. PROPOSING CALIFORNIA BILLS- SO. I WOULD IMAGINE. YOU KNOW THIS IS THE PROCESS OF THE YOU KNOW THE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE PROCESS IS TO. GET ALL THESE IDEAS DOWN INTO ONE IDEA THAT THEY CAN. BE USEFUL IN AND- EFFECTIVE. CONCERNING IN THE POSSESSION OF A STOLEN ITEM AND WHAT YOU KNOW UNKNOWINGLY- AS AN INNOCENT INTERMEDIARY OR INNOCENT PERSON IN THE IN THE- CHAIN OF POSSESSION BETWEEN THE FAST AND THE RECYCLER. THERE'S PROBABLY A VERY LIMITED SITUATION WHERE THAT MIGHT COME UP I THINK LAW ENFORCEMENT'S OPINION IS- YOU KNOW THE PERSON STEALING IN THE- CALIBRATOR IS THE SAME PERSON THAT SELLING IT TO THE RECYCLER- THAT WOULD BE VERY LITTLE REASON FOR THERE TO BE AN EXCHANGE. BETWEEN THAT THOSE TWO TRANSACTIONS- SO I THINK THAT THIS BILL WITH IDENTIFICATION BEING REQUIRED ON THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER TREAT ELIMINATE SOME OF THAT- A SUSPICION AND- I'M SORRY I MISSED THE TERM THAT YOU USED- CIRCUMSTANTIAL EVIDENCE- BY HAVING THE VIN NUMBER ON ORIENT I DIVIDE I DIDN'T FIND NUMBER ON THE- ON THE- KELLY CONVERTER- EVERY. REMOVE SOME OF THAT BECAUSE NOW THAT KELLY CONVERTER IS TRACEABLE TO A VEHICLE. IT CAN BE PROVEN THAT IT WAS THAT THAT VEHICLES NOW MISSING A CATALYTIC CONVERTER THAT CAL. VEHICLE WITH THIS VIN NUMBER MATCHES THIS CATALYTIC CONVERTER. SOMEWHERE SOMEBODY- REMOVED THAT CATALYTIC CONVERTER ILLEGALLY AND SO I THINK THAT CREATES A GIVES A POLICE A LEGITIMATE TOOL TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY'RE- GOING AFTER THE PROPER PERSON THAT STOLE THE VEHICLE OF SOMEBODY IN IN YOUR SITUATION. IF THERE IS A CASE WHERE SOMEBODY HAS POSSESSION OF A STOLEN COUNTY CONVERTER AND THEY'RE NOT THE ONE THAT STOLE IT. WELL NOW THE POLICE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO QUESTION THAT PERSON OR DO YOU GET IT YOU KNOW WHY DO YOU HAVE IT- AND HOPEFULLY THEY HAVE. A LEGITIMATE STORY THAT. PROVES THEIR INNOCENCE BUT SOMEBODY'S GUILTY. THEY DON'T THEY DON'T WANT TO TAKE POSSESSION OF STOLEN PROPERTY AND SO. IT IN OREGON AFTER THE AGAIN WHAT YOU SAID THE BLACK MARKET THE- THE PEOPLE THAT ARE FILING THESE FICTITIOUS BUSINESSES. TO GET AROUND YOU KNOW ALL OF THIS AND SO I WOULD SAY. TO YOUR POINT REGARDING- YOU KNOW THE CRIMINALS LAZIER- CAVALIER. SOME OF THEM MAY THAT MAYBE TO SOME OF OUR VERY REFINED IN VERY. SMARTEN UP TO SPEED ON THE LAN OUR FILE AND THAT'S A THAT'S A- PRETTY THOUGHTFUL THING TO DO IS GO FILE A FICTITIOUS BUSINESS. TO BE ABLE TO CONTINUE THIS- ACTIVITY. SO WE WANT TO OFFER THAT AS WELL. R. ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS. NO OKAY BY TWO- HAVE A LITTLE CONCERNED WITH THE MERIT OF CATALYTIC CONVERTER BILLS THAT ARE GOING TO BOTH HOUSES IN THE LIST OF CONCERNS AT A VENUE. FOR A VOICE BY A NEW CAR DEALERSHIPS AS WELL AS THE ALLIANCE SO HOW DO YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THE- CONCERNS THAT THEY HAVE A- SO I ON THE- PREVIOUS- TESTIMONY I KNOW THAT THERE WAS SOME MENTION- REGARDING CATALYTIC CONVERTERS THEY'RE DIFFICULT TO GET TO AND REQUIRE HOURS OF TIME FOR EVEN AT TRAINED TECHNICIAN TO GET TO. THAT THAT IS AN ISSUE LIKE THE PREVIOUS AUTHOR I WASN'T AWARE OF UNTIL YOU INTERVIEWS THIS BILL SO- WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO PUT THAT LANGUAGE. INTO THE BILL THAT. WOULD BE- EXEMPT YOU KNOW THOSE TYPES OF VEHICLES IF THEY CATHOLIC CONVERTERS PART. INTEGRATED INTO THE EXHAUST MANIFOLD. THAT IS NOT GONNA GET STOLEN- WITHOUT CIVIL STILL THE WHOLE CAR- THEN THE KEYSTONE BUT YOU'RE NOT GONNA STILL JUST THE CATALYTIC CONVERTER. AT A SOMETHING LIKE THAT SO WE'RE TRYING TO FIND A WAY YOU KNOW EITHER THROUGH THE REPAIR MANUALS LANGUAGE OR- YOU KNOW SOMEONE THAT WE CAN PUT THAT. MAKE THAT LANGUAGE MAKES SENSE- WE'VE HAD VERY GOOD CONVERSATIONS WITH THE ALLIANCE AND WHAT THE NEW CAR DEALERS- I USED TO WORK IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY SO YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THEIR CONCERNS- WHEN WE INTRODUCED THE BILL. I KNEW THERE WAS GONNA BE CONCERNS BUT WE HAD TO START A DIALOGUE START THE CONVERSATION- AND I THINK WORKING ALL OF US TOGETHER WE'RE GOING TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE- THIS BILL MAKES THE MOST SENSE AND- AND MOVES ON. WE WERE LOOKING FOR A MOTION ON THIS MEASURE. IT'S BEEN MOVED VICE SOONER CHAU BULK- WE HAVE A WELL WE HAVE NO RECOMMENDATION ON THIS BUT IT'S A TO PASS TO. APPROPRIATIONS. COME TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON S. B. NINE ONE NINE MISTER CHAIR I CAN JUST MAKE IT ALL YEAH I'M SORRY IF YOU WANT WE CAN CLOSING STATEMENT AND I'LL BE BRIEF- WELL I ALL THROUGH THESE BILLS ARE GOING TO GO TO PROBES- I SENT APPROACH THE PROPS CHAIR HAS WON THE BILLS- I WOULD APPRECIATE- THE BILL MOVING FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN.

COME TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL MINISTRY NINE ONE ON. ONE THREE NINE ONE NINE BRADFORD. AYE A CHOI BOGUE CHAU BUG EYED COM LONGER VOTING COME ON YOU'RE NOT VOTING SKINNER. WIENER. LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU NEXT UP IS S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY FIVE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF THIS MORNING I'M ALSO PRESENTING S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY FIVE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE EACH BOARDING BUREAU WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO PUBLICLY POST A LIST OF CRITERIA USED TO EVALUATE APPLICANTS WITH CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS. THIS WILL HELP APPLICANTS UNDERSTAND THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF BEING GRANTED BUSINESS LICENSURE BEFORE THEY APPLY WELL RECENT LEGISLATION NOW REQUIRES THESE BOARDS AND BUREAUS DEPOSE CRITERIA DEFINING WHICH CRIMES CAN DISQUALIFY APPLICANTS IT IS IMPORTANT TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FOR HOW THESE APPLICANTS WILL ACTUALLY BE EVALUATED. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRE THE DCA TO DEVELOP DEVELOP A CLEAR PROCESS FOR VERIFYING APPLICANT INFORMATION INCLUDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR APPLICANTS TO PROVIDE CERTIFIED COURT DOCUMENTS SO THAT THEIR CONVICTION CONVICTIONS ARE ACCURATELY RECORDED. ALL SOME BOARDS ALREADY DO THIS SOLIDIFYING A UNIFORM PROCESS ACROSS ALL OF DCA WILL PROVIDE CLARITY FOR ALL FUTURE LICENSEES FURTHERMORE SB THIRTY SIXTY FIVE ALSO REQUIRES THESE BOARDS AND BUREAUS TO DEVELOP A PROCEDURE FOR PROVIDING AN INFORMAL APPEALS PROCESS. THIS WILL MAKE ASKING FOR A BILL EASIER AND LESS TIME CONSUMING FOR APPLICANTS WHO HAVE BEEN DENIED WITH ME TODAY TESTIFIED IN SUPPORT OF THIS MAJORS EVAN RARICK EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION THE SPONSOR OF THIS MAJOR. AT THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ETHAN AMERICAN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE LITTLE HOOVER COMMISSION- THE COMMISSION IS AN INDEPENDENT BIPARTISAN OVERSIGHT AGENCY CHARGED WITH MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS. FOR IMPROVEMENTS TO STATE GOVERNMENT IN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE COMMISSION ISSUED A REPORT EXAMINING CALIFORNIA'S OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING SYSTEM JOBS FOR CALIFORNIANS STRATEGIES TO EASE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING BARRIERS. DURING ITS STUDY THE COMMISSION CONCLUDED THAT CALIFORNIA SHOULD EASE THE PATH FOR GROUPS DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY EXISTING BARRIERS INCLUDING FORMER OFFENDERS IN OUR REPORT WE RECOMMENDED SEVERAL STEPS TO HELP ADDRESS THESE CHALLENGES. INCLUDING THE CREATION OF AN INFORMAL APPEALS PROCESS AND THE POSTING ONLINE OF INFORMATION THAT WOULD HELP POTENTIAL ADVOCATE AT APPLICANTS ASSESS THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF LICENSURE PRIOR TO APPLYING. SINCE OUR REPORT WAS ISSUED THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR TOOK IMPORTANT STEPS TO IMPROVE THE SYSTEM THROUGH THE PASSAGE OF AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY EIGHT IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN WE BELIEVE S. B. THIRTEEN SIXTY FIVE WOULD FURTHER ADVANCE THE COMMISSION'S RECOMMENDATIONS. BY HELPING TO MITIGATE SOME OF THE CHALLENGES NOW FACED BY PAST OFFENDERS IN PARTICULAR AS SENATOR JONES MENTIONED THE BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF CONSUMER AFFAIRS TO DEVELOP. AN INFORMAL APPEALS PROCESS. AND WHICH WOULD OCCUR AFTER AN INITIAL LICENSE DENIAL BUT BEFORE AN ADMINISTRATIVE LAW HEARING THIS WAS SOMETHING THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED. THE BILL WOULD ALSO SPECIFY THAT LICENSING BOARDS MUST POST ON THEIR WEBSITE THE CRITERIA USED TO EVALUATE APPLICANTS SO THE POTENTIAL APPLICANTS MAY BE BETTER INFORMED ABOUT THEIR LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS BEFORE. INVESTING TIME AND RESOURCES IN THE PROCESS AGAIN THIS AYE SOMEWHERE SLIGHTLY WHAT THE COMMISSION RECOMMENDED IN ITS TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN REPORT. AND WE BELIEVE THIS PROVISION GOES BEYOND THE CURRENT REQUIREMENTS THE BOARD'S POST A SUMMARY OF THE CRITERIA USED TO CONSIDER WHETHER A CRIME IS SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED TO THE WORK BEING LICENSED.

SB ONE THOUSAND EIGHT ELIMINATES TELECOMMUNICATION FEES FOR ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO AND FROM CURRENT INCARCERATED PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA'S LOCAL JAILS AND STATE PRISONS TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES INCLUDE PHONE CALLS VIDEO CONFERENCING AND EMAILS. CAUSE FOR THE SERVICES PREVENT MANY CRUSHER TO PEOPLE FROM ACCESSING VITAL LIFELINES WITH THEIR FAMILIES MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS AND RESOURCES FOR RE ENTRY. IS THAT THE STRUCTURE FUELS ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INDUSTRY THAT PRIORITIZES PROFITS OVER PEOPLE. COULD THE COUNTIES ARE CAPPED AT SEVEN CENTS PER MINUTE FOR PHONE CALLS IN JAILS. AND PRISONS ARE SET AT THREE CENTS PER MINUTE. RATE CAPS HAVE GREATLY INCREASED ACCESS COMMUNICATION. ANYWAY PRESENTS A BEAR TO ME KENNY CATION AND CONCRETE FINANCIAL HARDSHIP FOR FAMILIES OF INCARCERATED PEOPLE. PARDEE PANDEMIC MORE THAN ONE IN THREE FAMILIES WERE DRIVEN INTO DEBT. WELL STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN CONTACT WITH THEIR LOVED ONES ON THE INSIDE. WITH 87% THIS WEIGHT FALLING ON WOMEN. SINCE THAT IS ESTIMATED FINANCIAL BURDEN HAS INCREASED AND COMMUNICATION IS BECOMING EVEN MORE LIMITED. THE COUNTY JAIL SYSTEM IS ESPECIALLY HARD TO NAVIGATE WITH EACH OPERATING ON DIFFERENT SYSTEMS WITH DIFFERENT PROVIDERS THE CONSISTENCY CAUSES ISSUES AND TRANSFER MONEY WHEN LOVE WANTS TO MOVE TO A DIFFERENT FACILITY. FURTHER DELAYING ESSENTIAL COMMUNICATIONS AND EXASPERATING FEELINGS OF ISOLATION. BASE DAMAGING FREE COMMUNICATION THROUGH SB ONE THOUSAND EIGHT. BUT STREAMLINED TELECOMMUNICATION AND SHORT EQUITABLE ACCESS TO ON COURSE RATED PEOPLE AND THEIR FAMILIES QUESTION PEOPLE CAN'T CONNECT WITH THEIR SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO PLAN FOR THE RELEASE INCLUDING FINDING A JOB AND HOUSING. HOWEVER MOST IMPORTANTLY LEBRON TO BE ABLE TO TALK TO EACH OTHER AND MAINTAIN ESSENTIAL LIFELINES TO FRIENDS AND FAMILY. SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND COMMUNICATIONS ARE INTEGRAL PART OF THE HUMAN EXPERIENCE. CUTTING INCARCERATE PEOPLE OFF THEIR LOVED ONES HURTS THE INDIVIDUAL THE FAMILY AND A CHANCE AT SUCCESSFUL REINTEGRATION. I TESTIFIED TODAY WE HAVE MARIA CONCEALERS FROM THE FOUNDER AT THE FOUNDER AND EXECUTIVE LEADER PRIDE IN TRUTH AND THEN THE PHONE BIANCA TYLER THE EXECUTOR AFTER FOURTH RISES MINUTES APIECE CHAU.

ARE TO THE FAMILIES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY MASS INCARCERATION AT THE FORMERLY INCARCERATED SINGLE MOTHER. A PERSON WHO IS CURRENTLY EXPERIENCING THE IMPACT OF HAVING A LOVE ONE INCARCERATED. HAVING FREE PHONE CALLS WITH MY SON WOULD HELP OUR FAMILY TREMENDOUSLY. IF S. B. ONE ZERO ZERO EIGHT PASSES I WOULD BE ABLE TO STAY CONNECTED WITH MY SON. THE CONNECTION WITH MY SON IS JUST IT'S NOT JUST ABOUT CHECKING IN. TO KNOW THAT HE IS SAFE. TO KNOW THAT HE'S ALIVE OR TO SAY HI. IT'S ABOUT SUPPORTING HIS PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH DURING HIS INCARCERATION. INCARCERATED PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT ALONE AND THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTED AND LOVED.

THE LAST EIGHT MONTHS I HAVE BEEN PAYING FEES TO TALK TO MY SON DURING HIS INCARCERATION. PEOPLE ASK ME WHY AM I SO SUPPORTIVE OF HIM. MY ANSWER IS BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE INCARCERATED AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR HIM TO KNOW THAT IF HE'S NOT A FAILURE. SEVENTEEN YEARS AGO I WAS INCARCERATED AND TURNED A NEW LEAF BECAUSE OF MY FAMILY SUPPORT DURING THE MOST DIFFICULT TIME OF MY LIFE. NOW BECAUSE OF ALL THE LOVE AND SUPPORT OF MY FAMILY AND LOVED ONES AND FRIENDS THAT WERE THERE FOR ME. I AM A FORMER HEALTHCARE WORKER I WAS ABLE TO RETIRE IN TWENTY NINETEEN FROM NURSING.

CENTER COMMONER I KNOW YOU TIRED I MEAN MISTER CHAIR I'M SORRY- SO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT I'M- GOING TO BE- SUPPORTING THIS BILL I THINK THAT- GTL IS A RACK RACKET QUITE FRANKLY- I THINK THAT EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO CONNECT WITH THEIR FAMILY AND FRIENDS AND THEIR LOVED ONES. I THINK THAT HAVING OPERABLE DEVICES IS KEY I THINK THAT OFTEN I KNOW THAT OFTENTIMES. LOCKDOWNS HAPPEN THROUGH NO FAULT OF CERTAIN INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE THEN DENIED ACCESS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EITHER COUNCIL OR THEIR FRIENDS AND FAMILY. I KNOW THAT CONTRABAND IS AN ISSUE IN OUR DETENTION CENTERS AND ON OUR FACILITIES BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE HAVE THROWN UP THEIR HANDS. AROUND NOT BEING ABLE TO COMMUNICATE AND LAST I CHECKED THAT WAS STILL A RIGHT. I KNOW THAT AS A RESULT OF THE COSTS TO MAKE PHONE CALLS WHICH ARE EXORBITANT. THAT PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED ARE PAYING TO BE INCARCERATED AND THAT PEOPLE ON THE OUTSIDE ARE PAYING TO HAVE SOMEONE INCARCERATED AND IT MAKES NO SENSE SO- AS A RESULT OF ALL OF THOSE ISSUES THAT I STATED AND THEN SOME I WILL BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND IF THE- AUTHOR WOULD. BE SO GRACIOUS I'D LIKE TO BE ADDED AS A CO OP. AND I TO WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THIS MEASURE THINK ADDS COMMONSENSE THAT PRISONERS. WHETHER IN JAIL OR PRISON- INCARCERATED. NOT ONLY HAVE THE RIGHT BUT NEED THE OPPORTUNITY TO COMMUNICATE WITH NOT ONLY THEIR LEGAL COUNSEL THE LOVED ONES AS WELL TO HELP KEEP THEM CONNECTED AND MOTIVATED TO. DO THE RIGHT THINGS ONCE OUT SHOW AND AS INDIVIDUAL WHO USED TO WORK FOR A TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANY I WAS BLOWN AWAY AT. THE MODEL MONEY THEY MAKE ON PRISON COSTS IT'S CRIMINAL IN AND OF ITSELF- HOW MUCH THESE COMPANIES MAKE- JUST A FORTUNE ONE A- TWO THREE MINUTE PHONE CALL SO- I'M REGION I THINK YOU BRING AFFORD AND IF YOU.

WELL ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS- I RISE TODAY TO PRESENT SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY SIX OF WHICH IS- TO WILL HARMONIZE STATE AND FEDERAL TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS IN REGARDS LEAD BASED RELATED PAINTED IN THE SAFETY THEIR UP. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES CONTRACTORS AND INDIVIDUALS WHO DO WORK THAT MIGHT DISRUPT LEAD PAINT TO BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED AT BOTH THE FEDERAL AND STATE LEVELS. THIS HAS LED TO LOTS OF CONFUSION IN THE INDUSTRY ABOUT STATE AND THE FEDERAL. TO ADDRESSES CONFUSION SENATE BILL TEN SEVENTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO ADOPT AND UPDATE THEIR TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS TO REFLECT THE FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS. IN PRACTICE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW CONTRACTORS AND INDIVIDUALS TO BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED ONCE AND ONLY ONCE INSTEAD OF THE CURRENT PRACTICE WHICH REQUIRES A SEPARATE TRAINING BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL. ALTHOUGH LEAD PAINT HAS BEEN BANNED CALIFORNIA FOR DECADES LEAD POISONING FROM EXPOSURE TO LEAD PAINT CONTINUES TO PLAGUE OUR STATE. IN FACT AS NOTED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT LEGISLATIVE ANALYSIS OFFICE ESTIMATES THAT ABOUT 60% OF THE HOUSES IN CALIFORNIA. WERE BUILT BEFORE NINETEEN SEVENTY EIGHT ENTER SHOWN TO HAVE LEAD BASED PAINT. EXPOSURE LEAD BASED PAINT AT ANY LEVEL CAN HAVE SERIOUS NEGATIVE EFFECTS FOR BOTH CHILDREN AND ADULTS ALIKE. HOWEVER LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN IS PARTICULAR IN PARTICULAR AREA OF CONCERN BECAUSE IT IS SO DANGEROUS TO THE CHILDREN. EVEN A SLIGHT ELEVATION OF BLOOD LEVEL. IN LEAD BASED PAINT IN A CHILD CAN REQUIRE AND REDUCED RATHER REDUCE IQ. CAUSE BRAIN AND NERVE DAMAGE AND EVEN STUNT A CHILD'S GROWTH EXPOSURE TO LEAD IS MOST COMMON DURING RENOVATION. AN UNTRAINED INDIVIDUAL WHO DOES NOT FOLLOW PROPER PROTOCOLS CAN AND THEN AND ONLY IT CHIP LEAD PAINT FROM THE SURFACE AND THAT WILL EXPOSURE WILL TAKE IT IN THE YARDS INTO NEIGHBORHOODS AND WHICH IS CRIMINAL. BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT IT SENDS UP CLOUDS OF LEAD PAINT DUST- DURING THE SANDY AND IT WILL AFFECT EVERYONE IN THE AREA UNTRAINED UNCERTIFIED INDIVIDUALS WORKING WITH LEAD PAINT. THEY DO POSSESS THEIR POSE A HAZARD NOT JUST FOR THEMSELVES BUT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. S. B. TEN SEVENTY SIX ADDRESSES THIS LEAD ISSUE AND BY STREAMLINING AND HARMONIZING OUR TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION PROCESS AND AT THE TIME- WILL STRENGTHEN OUR OVERSIGHT BY EMPOWERING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO HANDLE THE ENFORCEMENT. IN ADDITION THIS BILL REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CONTRACTORS STATE LICENSE BOARD TO COLLABORATE IN EMPLOYMENT AND EDUCATION AND OUTREACH PROGRAM. TO INFORM INDIVIDUALS OF THE HARMS OF LEAD AND THE REQUIREMENTS TO BE TRAINED AND CERTIFIED. THIS OUTREACH PROGRAM WILL RUN FOR ONE FULL YEAR BEFORE CERTIFICATION AND TRAINED REQUIRED TRAINING REQUIREMENTS WILL BE ENFORCED GIVING EVERYONE AMPLE TIME TO COMPLY THIS BILL HAS RECEIVED NO OPPOSITION AND HAS AND IS IN SUPPORT SUPPORT BY THE NUMBER OF HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL. ORGANIZATIONS FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS AND WITH ME TODAY I HAVE SUSAN LITTLE REPRESENTING THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND ON THE TELEPHONE. ON THE LINE HOPEFULLY HE'S STILL THERE IS LARRY BROOKS OF REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU WILL FOR YOUR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES- TWO MINUTES EACH IN SUPPORT- MISSILE YOU MAY BEGIN WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR AUTHORING THIS BILL. A GOOD MORNING MY NAME SUSAN LITTLE I'M WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP ONE OF THE CO SPONSORS OF SB TEN SEVENTY SIX. AS THE SENATOR WAS EXPLAINING IT HAD LET IS VERY HARMFUL TO CHILDREN AND ADULTS BUT YOUNG CHILDREN ARE THE MOST SENSITIVE TO NEED TO THE NEUROTOXINS AFFECTS. EXPOSURE TO EVEN MINUTE AMOUNTS OF LEAD CAN CAUSE PERMANENT HARM TO A CHILD DEVELOPING BRAIN AND NERVOUS SYSTEM AND BECAUSE OF THIS HARM THE CNTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL OF DETERMINES THERE'S NO SAFE LEVEL OF LEAD EXPOSURE IN CHILDREN AND ADULTS LEAD POISONING CAN CAUSE HIGH BLOOD PRESSUREAND REPRODUCTIVE HARM. AND CAN LEAD TO PREMATURE BIRTH AND MISCARRIAGE LEAD POISONING CAN ALSO CAUSE CANCER. UNFORTUNATELY STATISTICS INDICATE THAT LOW INCOME CHILDREN ARE LEAD POISONED MORE OFTEN THAN CHILDREN FROM HIGHER INCOME FAMILIES THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH INDICATES THAT POISONED CHILDREN ARE ON MEDICAID I'LL- THIS UNEVEN DISTRIBUTION IS IN PART BECAUSE LOW INCOME CHILDREN ARE MORE LIKELY TO LIVE. IN AND AROUND. OLDER HOUSING THAT HAS CHIPPED OR PEELED. PEELING LEAD BASED PAINT. WHEN THIS PAINTS DISTURB CHAPTER SANDED LEAD DUST MOBILIZES INTO THE SURROUNDING ENVIRONMENT. AND CAN BE INHALED INGESTED OR TRACK TO OTHER LOCATIONS AND HOLDS. LET'S SAFE RENOVATION PRACTICES AREN'T CONSISTENTLY USED IN CALIFORNIA DUE TO CONFLICTING STATE AND FEDERAL LAWS. THIS PROBLEMS BEEN EXPERIENCED BY OTHER STATES AS WELL AND SO TO DATE FOURTEEN STATES HAVE DONE WHAT SB TEN SEVENTY SIX PROPOSES TO DO. AND THEY HAD AND HAVE INCORPORATED THE FEDERAL RENOVATION AND REPAIR PROGRAM INTO THEIR STATE REGULATIONS. CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO THE SAME SO THAT LET'S SAY FOR INNOVATION PRACTICES ARE UNIFORMLY EMPLOYED IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS. WE APPRECIATE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB TEN SEVENTY SIX THANK YOU AND I ALSO WANTED TO JUST REITERATE THE SUPPORT FROM THE FAMILIES ADVOCATING FOR CHEMICALS AND TOXIC SAFETY.

THE FEDERAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMITS THAT THEY LACK CAPACITY TO EFFECTIVELY ENFORCE THE LEAD SAFETY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS RENOVATION REPAIR PAINTING RULE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL AS A CODE ENFORCEMENT OFFICER AND HEALTHY HOUSING SPECIALIST I AND OTHERS LIKE ME. THROUGHOUT THE STATE ROUTINELY RECEIVED COMPLAINTS FROM RESIDENTS REGARDING UNSAFE AND OFTEN UNLICENSED LABORERS PERFORMING RENOVATION AND OR REPAIR WORK ON HOMES IN WHICH THEY CREATE LEAD PAINT CHIPS AND DUST DEBRIS THAT CAN BE INHALED BY ADULTS AND DIRECTLY INGESTED BY SMALL CHILDREN CRAWLING ON FLOORS ARE CLEAN AND CONTAMINATED SOIL. BUSTY INDIVIDUALS CONDUCTING THESE UNSAFE RENOVATION REPAIR AND PAINTING JOBS HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO NOT ONLY TOWARDS IN THEIR CUSTOMERS AND NEIGHBORS OF THEIR CUSTOMERS BUT EVEN THEMSELVES IN THEIR OWN CHILDREN IN SUCH TRAGEDIES COULD HAVE BEEN. AVOIDED IF THESE WORKERS SHOULD USE LEAD SAFE WORK PRACTICES PART IN THE ONE DAY ONLY ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY RENOVATION REPAIR AND PAINTING RULE COURSE ALSO KNOWN AS R. P.

A TURBO I ABOAGYE COM LONGER. INNER WINNER I MEAN ARE I. ONE CALL. DO YOU WANT ME TO YOUR BILL- YES WHEN WE DO HAVE TWO BILLS- ONE WE START WITH A THIRTY FOUR. LET. WELCOME VISITOR OF AIR YOU MAY PRESENT S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE. MADAM CHAIR AND CENTERS I'M PLEASED TO PRESENT SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WHICH WOULD CREATE A HEARSAY EXCEPTION IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES FOR STATEMENTS MADE FOR PURPOSES OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS. VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ARE AMONG THE MOST VULNERABLE IN OUR COMMUNITIES AND UNFORTUNATELY CRIMES COMMITTED AGAINST THEM ARE AMONG THE MOST DIFFICULT TO PROSECUTE. THERE ARE FEW WITNESSES TO THIS TYPE OF ABUSE WHICH OCCURS ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BEHIND CLOSED DOORS ENORMOUS PRESSURE IS OFTEN BROUGHT UPON VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE FREQUENTLY FROM THEIR ABUSERS OR FAMILIES TO DENY THE ABUSE THEY ARE ENTERING. IN MANY INSTANCES A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL MAY BE THE ONLY PERSON TO WHOM-THE VICTIM DISCLOSES THE EXTENT OF THE ABUSE FOR INJURY OR LOSS RIGHTLY SHIELD VICTIMS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE WHO REFUSED TO TESTIFY FROM PENAL CONSEQUENCES THEY CANNOT BE INCARCERATED FOR REFUSING TO TESTIFY. REFUSING TO TESTIFY IS NOT HOWEVER INDICATIVE OF A DESIRE TO BE LEFT UNPROTECTED AND SO WE CONTINUE TO PROSECUTE OFFENDERS WITHOUT FORCING VICTIMS TO THE STAND WHERE THEY MIGHT PUT THEMSELVES IN GREATER DANGER FOR ABUSE OR ISOLATION. IN THESE INSTANCES WHERE VICTIMS CANNOT SPEAK FOR THEMSELVES SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD ALLOW VICTIMS TRUTH TO BE HEARD. THIS BILL WOULD CREATE A HEARSAY EXCEPTION FOR STATEMENTS MADE BY A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM TO A MEDICAL CARE PROVIDER FOR PURPOSES OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT. AS WELL AS STATEMENTS REASONABLY PERTINENT TO MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT. THE CHANGE WILL CONFORM CALIFORNIA'S TREATMENT OF THE STATEMENTS. TO FEDERAL LAW AND THAT OF OTHER STATES SINCE FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE IN ITS RULE EIGHT OH THREE SUBSECTION FOR PERMIT STATEMENTS FOR PURPOSE OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS IN ALL CASES REGARDLESS OF THE DAY CLARENCE AVAILABILITY AT TRIAL. CALIFORNIA ALSO ALREADY OFFERS THIS EXEMPTION IN CASES OF CHILD ABUSE SB ELEVEN THIRTY SIX EXCUSE ME SB ELEVEN TWENTY THREE EXTENDS THE SAME PROTECTION. TO ANOTHER VULNERABLE POPULATION. MEDICAL HERE SAY WOULD BE A CRITICAL AND EFFECTIVE TOOL TO COUNTERACT AND ABUSERS MANIPULATIONS AND THREATS THAT PRE PREVENT VICTIM TESTIMONY CONSISTENT AND EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION OF DOMESTIC ABUSE HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF DECREASING THE INCIDENCE OF DOMESTIC ABUSE. BUT EFFECTIVE PROSECUTION REQUIRES COMPELLING EVIDENCE THIS BILL ALLOWS PROSECUTORS TO EFFECTIVELY PROSECUTE DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THEREBY PROTECTING VICTIMS FROM FURTHER ABUSE WHILE HONORING VICTIMS CHOICE NOT TO TESTIFY. THANK YOU AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT IS MIKE MICHAEL FUHRMAN CHIEF ASSISTANT DISTRICT ATTORNEY AT THE SAMBAR DINO COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S OFFICE. WELCOME MR BERMAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO RECEIVE MORNING THANK YOU THANK YOU ARE. MADAM LOOK. MA'AM CENTER WHO SITTING AS CHAIR SO THANK YOU FOR LIVE ME TO SPEAK TO IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE IT IS HAS A CENTER INDICATED A MODIFICATION TO EVIDENCE CODE SECTION TWELVE FIFTY THREE. PERMITTING STATEMENTS MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS BUT VERY NARROWLY TAILORED UNLIKE THE FEDERAL RULE EIGHT OH THREE FOUR ONLY TO DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES- THIS IS A- I HEAR TAKES ACTION THAT HAS GREAT SIGNIFICANCE TO ME I IT IS ON APRIL TWENTY EIGHTH TWO THOUSAND IT WAS THE DAY THAT BACKING MOURINHO'S HA WAS BRUTALLY MURDERED IN BARSTOW CALIFORNIA AND I HANDLED THE PROSECUTION OF THAT CASE. SHE'S BEATEN ARE A BILL WAS WRAPPED AROUND HER NECK AND SHORT WAS STUFFED UNDER HER THROAT ARE HER TEETH WERE KNOCKED OUT WE CALL THAT AN ABORTION SHE WAS THROWN A TRASH CAN BE FOUND BY HER FATHER. SHE WAS MURDERED BY THE FATHER OF HER SON MURDERED AFTER A DECADE OF ABUSE AFTER INVOLVEMENTS- WITH THE POLICE TRIPS TO THE HOSPITAL AND DOCTORS AND ON NONE OF THOSE STATEMENTS WERE ADMISSIBLE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WOULD HAVE BEEN OTHERWISE ADMISSIBLE IN AT LEAST FIVE STATES AND CERTAINLY IN THE FEDERAL JURISDICTION. I CAN'T HELP BUT THINK SENATOR THE- MAN WHO I SPENT TIME WITH SINCE TWO THOUSAND. WHO IS EIGHT YEARS OLD THE TIME. WHO STRUGGLED WITH SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND WITH- REPEATED ARRESTS. THAT HE IF HE HAD HIS MOTHER AROUND IF WE DID WHAT WE SHOULD HAVE DONE BY ADMITTING THAT. SO THAT SHE WOULD BE HERE TODAY- I THINK HIS LIFE WOULD HAVE BEEN DRASTICALLY DIFFERENT. I REALIZE THAT MY DEFENSE ATTORNEY- COLLEAGUES HAVE ADVANCED CONCERNS. RELATED TO- THIS MOMENT RIGHT TO CONFRONTATION. ARE WE HAVE MADE BY THE CENTER WILL MAKE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS- THAT WILL ADDRESSES CONCERNS BUT I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IT WILL NOT. A REMOVED MY DEFENSE ATTORNEY. FRIENDS OPPOSITION- BECAUSE IT DEALS WITH OUR RESPECTIVE VIEWS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE. WE SEEK TO RESTORE THE VOICE OF VICTIMS ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS. VOICE IS INTIMIDATED INTO SILENCE TO THE VIOLENCE. CHILDREN OR- FORTY AND EVEN LOVE. OUR CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCREASING CYCLE OF VIOLENCE THAT OCCURS ON INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE REPEATEDLY VICTIMIZED. AND THEIR SILENCE OUR IS A PART OF THAT THAT CYCLE OF VIOLENCE. AND OUR CONCERN IS THAT WE PLACE THEM IN GREATER DANGER. AS THE PRECOURT NOTED- UNITED SUPREME COURT THAT THIS PARTICULAR TYPE OF CRIME IS SUSCEPTIBLE TO INTIMIDATION OR COERCION OF THE VICTIM. TO ENSURE THAT SHE DOES NOT TESTIFY AT TRIAL. WE SEEK THIS NARROW EXCEPTION TO ALLOW STATEMENTS THAT ARE MADE ONLY IN THE SERIES OF CASES. IN WHICH THEY SEEK MEDICAL TREATMENT THAT THEY BE ADMISSIBLE IN THE COURT AND THE PROSECUTION. AND WE REQUEST ARRIVAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER FOR MAY. WE DO NOT HAVE ANOTHER LEAD WITNESS BUT WE WILL CONTINUE WILL MOVE ON TO ANYONE WANTING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE- WILL BEGIN HERE IN THIS ROOM ONE TWELVE M. STONE STONE ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION PROUD SPONSOR OF THIS VERY LIMITED NARROW THEY'LL. THANK YOU DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN THE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. SIXTEEN NINE WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES WHAT. WOULD YOU. SORRY. OSCAR SORIANA SUPPORT THIS BILL. THANK YOU OSCAR WILL NOW MOVE TO MOVE ON TO THE WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA THE TELECONFERENCE OR VERSUS- IT WILL TAKE TEN MINUTES OF TESTIMONY. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATTER OUR MODERATOR- SEE WE DO HAVE ONE LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON FROM THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. ARE YOU ON THE A PERSON PERFECT I AM THE PERSON. MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION WE OPPOSE SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WHICH CREATES A WAY TO AVOID THE RIGHT TO CONFRONTATION ASSURED TO ALL OF US BY THE CONSTITUTION I DO TAKE ISSUE WITH THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY'S COMMENT SUGGESTING THAT. THE DIFFERENCE OF OPINION OVER THIS BILL RELATES TO OUR POSITION ON DOMESTIC VIOLENCE THE DEFENSE TAKES DOMESTIC VIOLENCE AS SERIOUSLY AS ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMUNITY OUR DIFFERENCES OVER THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE WOULD AMEND EVIDENCE CODE SECTION TWELVE FIFTY THREE BY ADDING A SUBDIVISION WHICH WOULD CREATE A NEW HERE SAYING GEN. IT WOULD ALLOW THE INTRODUCTION IN COURT OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE ALLEGED VICTIMS DESCRIPTIONS OF ACCESS OR ATTEMPTED ACTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IF THE STATEMENT WAS MADE FOR MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT PURPOSES AND DESCRIBES CURRENT OR PAST MEDICAL HISTORY OR SYMPTOMS. INTRODUCED SHOULD INTRODUCTION OF THESE STATEMENTS WOULD THEN ALLOW THE PROSECUTOR TO PROCEED TO PROSECUTE AN INDIVIDUAL WITHOUT THE ALLEGED VICTIM EVER COMING FORWARD IN COURT IN FACT IN OUR- AND WE'VE HAD SEVERAL DISCUSSIONS THE CDA HAS ADMITTED THAT WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF THIS EVIDENCE CODE CARVE OUT THE PROSECUTION WISHES TO PROCEED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE ALLEGED VICTIM AVOIDING THE REQUIREMENTS GUARDRAILS IF YOU WILL OF THE CURRENT EVIDENCE CODE. EVIDENCE CODE SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTY SEVEN EIGHT ALREADY PROVIDES HEARSAY EXCEPTION FOR STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE INFLICTION OR THREAT OF PHYSICAL INJURY THAT ARE MADE TO MEDICAL FOR. OR LAW ENFORCEMENT. SB ELEVEN ONE WOULD GREATLY EXPAND CRIMINAL PROSECUTIONS AND CONVICTIONS. IN DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASES INCLUDING CASES WHERE THE VICTIM CHOSE NOT TO PARTICIPATE WHICH TO RECANT OR WAS AND COPPER UNCOOPERATIVE FOR MYRIAD OF REASONS. THIS BILL TAKES AWAY THE VICTIM'S AGENCY PARTICULARLY THE WOMEN WHO ARE ESSENTIALLY INFANTA LEISING THEM BY INCLUDING THEM WITH AN EVIDENCE CODE SECTION DESIGNED TO PROTECT YOUNG CHILDREN. THIS BILL MAKING THE HEARSAY STATEMENTS DELINEATED ADMISSIBLE WOULD DEPRIVE PERSONS ACCUSED OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE OF THEIR RIGHT TO CONFRONT THEIR ACCUSERS. THE CRAWFORD IN MALINDI IS CASE MELENDEZ DIAZ CASES DO NOT SAVE THIS FLOOD PROPOSED LEGISLATION AND MELENDEZ DIAZ THE U. S. SUPREME COURT SAID THE CONFRONTATION CLAUSE MAY MAKE THE PROSECUTION OF CRIMINALS MORE BURDENSOME BUT THAT IS EQUALLY TRUE OF THE RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY. AND THE PRIVILEGE AGAINST SELF INCRIMINATION. THE CARD CAN CLOSE THE CONTINUED LIKE OTHER CONSTITUTIONAL PROVISIONS IS BINDING AND WE MAY NOT DISREGARD IT AT OUR CONVENIENCE THANK YOU. SO WE DO HAVE A SECOND- LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESS KATHY SURE FROM THE ACLU CALIFORNIA ACTION AND I BELIEVE SHE IS ONLINE. KATHY ARE YOU ON THE LINE I AM PERFECT WOULD YOU LIKE TO PROCEED RIGHT I AM. PERFECT WONDERFUL YES PROCEED- GOOD MORNING THANK YOU SURE ON BEHALF OF EIGHTEEN MILLION CALIFORNIA ACTION. WE RESPECTFULLY MATTHEW CODES SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE. THE CONFRONTATION OF THE SIXTH AMENDMENT STATES THAT IN ALL CRAP CRIMINAL PROSECUTION THE ACCUSED SHALL ENJOY THE RIGHT BE CONFRONTED WITH THE WITNESSES AGAINST. IT IS A SIMPLE BUT POWERFUL CONCEPT SOMEONE FACING THE POWER OF THE STATE TO DEPRIVE THEM OF LIBERTY SHOULD KNOW WHO IS PROVIDING TESTIMONY AGAINST THEM. AND SHOULD HAVE THE CHANCE TO CONTEST THAT WITH THE TESTIMONY CARE ACT. THE CARD RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF A CRIMINAL DEFENDANT BEING ABLE TO TEST THE VERACITY OF THE WITNESSES AGAINST BY CROP. WITNESSES PRESENT IN COURT ALLOWS THE TRIER OF FACT IS EVEN WITNESS AND EVALUATE THE WITNESS'S CREDIBILITY. THE GOLD STANDARD FOR TESTING WITNESS CREDIBILITY ACROSS EXAMINATION. STATEMENTS PROVIDED FROM UNDERSEA WITNESSES AND CANNOT BE EXAMINED. WE DO NOT HAVE THE SAME TESTED RELIABILITY. IT FOLLOWS THAT EXCEPT WERE MADE TO THE REQUIREMENT THAT A WITNESS WITNESS TESTIFIED COURT THEY MUST BE NARAL AND MUST INCORPORATE SAFEGUARDS TO ENSURE RELIABILITY AS MUCH AS IS POSSIBLE WITHOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF CROSS EXAMINATION. EXISTING EVIDENCE CODE SECTION THIRTEEN SEVENTY ALLOWED IN A STATEMENT REGARDING THE INFLICTION OF PHYSICAL INJURY UPON THE DECLARATION AS SB ELEVEN THIRTY ONE PROPOSES TO DO. BUT ONLY WHERE THE DECLARATION IS UNAVAILABLE AS A WITNESS ACCORDING TO A STRICT STANDARD WHERE THE STATEMENT WAS MADE AT OR NEAR THE TIME OF THE INJURY. AND WHEN THE STATEMENT WAS MADE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WOULD INDICATE IT TRUSTWORTHINESS WITH THE LIST OF FACTORS. TO ALLOW THE COURT TO EVALUATE THAT TRUSTWORTHY. MOREOVER THE OPPOSING PARTY UNDER SECTION THIRTEEN HYUNDAI MUST BE GIVEN NOTICE OF THE STATEMENT. AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO. NONE OF THESE COULD OF PROVIDED IN THAT ELEVEN ONE. WITHOUT THE TAKING STRINGENT THAT ARE SEVENTY S. ELEVEN SEVEN ONE WILL. DOWN THE OF PROSECUTORS IT DID NOT AT THAT THE FINAL EIGHT THERE RIGHT TO CONFRONT THEIR QUEUE. ASSEMBLY NOT NEEDED THE SECTION THIRTEEN EIGHT ALL THERE ARE THOSE ONE WITNESS IS TRUE. SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE I KNOW. AND DAY EXPANSION HERE'S A- CREATED AND PEOPLE COULD SECTION. THREE WE RESPECT URGE NOTEBOOK. NOW TO WITNESSES OPPOSITE. OVER THE LONG. MODERATOR THANK YOU THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO COMMENT IN OPPOSITION- SB ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE PLEASE PRESS ONE TEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I DO HAVE ONE IN Q. IT'LL JUST BE ONE MOMENT FOR THAT COMMENT. YOU KNOW SOMEONE IN Q. I WILL COOK YES WE ARE WANTING TO OVER TWENTY ONE FORTY SEVEN PLEASE GO AHEAD. HI MY NAME IS JEANETTE AND I WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS MY OPPOSITION TO SB. ELEVEN SEVENTY ONE. Q. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU- OUR- YOU CAN MANY OTHERS ANY QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS IN REGARDS TO THIS MEASURE. NO. SEARCHES ON SOME OF THE EXAMPLES THAT WERE GIVEN- IT'S IMAGES WITNESSES WERE UNAVAILABLE SO I'M JUST TRYING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND LIKE ONE OF THE KINDS OF SITUATIONS. THAT WOULD NOT BE COVERED BY EXISTING HEARSAY EXCEPTIONS. THAT WOULD BE COVERED HERE- JUST BECAUSE EXAMPLES I HEARD IT SEEMED TO ME LIKE THOSE WILL PROBABLY ALREADY BE COVERED BY THE EXISTING- EXCEPTIONS NOT NECESSARILY UNDER THIRTEEN SEVENTY THE WITNESS WOULD HAVE TO BE UNAVAILABLE SOMETIMES WE WOULD HAVE WITNESSES THAT COULD BE POTENTIALLY AVAILABLE THESE ARE. STATEMENTS THAT ARE MADE FOR THE PURPOSE OF BUCKLE DIAGNOSIS WHICH DON'T CRAWL FALL UNDER THE CRAWFORD STANDARD CRAWFORD DEALS WITH BOTH TEST YEAH SPOKE WITH RIGHT TO CONFRONTATION SPECIFICALLY SPOKE TO TESTIMONIAL STATEMENTS STATEMENTS THAT WERE MADE FOR EXAMPLE FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSECUTION. OUR STATEMENTS WERE TRYING TO GO AFTER SO WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO SEE COMMISSION STATEMENTS THAT ARE INHERENTLY RELIABLE BECAUSE YOU'RE TOO AMERICAN POSITION FOR THE PURPOSE OF TREATMENT BUT BUT IT'S MERRILEES YOUR SIX OPTION FOR. INFLICTION OF. INJURY RIGHT WRONG ABOUT THAT. I THOUGHT AT THAT THAT'S NOT OUR BELIEF IN FRANKLY THIRTEEN SEVENTY WAS PASSED IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX MODIFIED IN TWO THOUSAND AND IT WAS UTILIZING- AND IT WAS THE BASIS FROM THE RESIDUAL EXCEPTION TO THE HEARSAY RULE IN THE FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE. THAT WAS PRE CRAWFORD IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOUR THAT PROTECTION THIS STILL DOES NOT MEET THE CRAWFORD STANDARD CRAWFORD STILL APPLIES TO TESTIMONIAL STATEMENTS THE STATEMENTS THAT WE ARE TRYING TO THAT THE CENTERS TRYING TO INTRODUCE OUR NON TESTIMONIAL IN NATURE. THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN MICHIGAN VERSUS BRYANT WITH RULE EIGHT OH THREE EIGHT FOUR SAID THAT THAT IS NOT CRAWFORD IMPLICATED INDEED WHAT THE COURT SAID IN CRAWFORD WAS THE CRAWFORD PLANS FOR SIX THE MOMENT ANALYSIS. BECOMES INAPPLICABLE IN SITUATIONS WHERE STATEMENTS ARE NON TESTIMONIAL. AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT WE'RE SEEKING HERE. OKAY TRYING ANSWER I THOUGHT I HAD A COPY IN OUR WITH ME PARENTS NOT IN MY- CAN I COPY. I THOUGHT. ONE MOMENT. WHEN NOBODY'S MINE IT'S ALL MARKED UP. A PUT UP HERE. JERRY. OKAY I'M SORRY I WAS REFERRING TO THIRTEEN SEVENTY I SYSTEM HAVE A THE NUMBER AND YES YOU I THINK YOU'RE REFERRING TO THE STATEMENT MADE AT OR NEAR THE TIME- EIGHT HOWEVER AGAIN THIS WAS THIS THIS THIS DOES NOT APPLY YOU CAN HAVE A SITUATION WHERE YOU GO TO THE DOCTOR DAYS WEEKS LATER WHERE YOU HAVE A OF A BROKEN COLLARBONE AND THERE WAS NO DISCUSSION ABOUT IT UNTIL A LATER TIME THERE OKAY THERE ARE A LOT OF INJURIES IN WHICH ESPECIALLY IN A RECANTING A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE VICTIM SITUATION. WHERE THEY MIGHT NOT TREATMENT IMMEDIATELY SO IN EXAMPLES YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF THE DRESS CERVANTES- WHO JUST GOES STRAIGHT TO THE HOSPITAL. AND IS TALKING TO THEIR ER INTAKE NURSE OR DOCTOR. SAYING YOU KNOW BY MY SPOUSE ON HIT ME AND BROKE MY ARM- BACK TO BE COVERED THIRTY SEVEN EVERY YEAR SIGN IF THEY WANT TO THE HOSPITAL. OR DOCTOR FOUR DAYS LATER AND MIGHT NOT BE. THAT THAT'S IT HAS TO BE AT OR NEAR THE TIME DRIVING NEAR THE TIME IF YOU IF YOU LIKE THAT THE POOR YOU GET HIT YOUR ARMS PROGRAM. AND THEN YOU GET A CARD DR THE HOSPITAL AND TALK TO THE- TO THE NURSE OF THE DOCTOR AND SAY THAT STYLE WOULD STRIKE ME AS ODD OR NEAR THE TIME. RIGHT YES BUT WHEN I'M TRYING ABOUT ARE THEY OFTEN TEACH. REAGAN INJURY OCCURRED BUT- TREATMENT DOES NOT OCCUR SOMETIME LATER. THAT OFTEN HAPPENS IN THESE SITUATIONS ESPECIALLY IN SITUATIONS WHERE THE SITE I'M JONATHAN. I'M DISTINGUISHING DIED OF THE TIME WE GO STRAIGHT TO THE ER AFTER. THE PERSON SALAS YOU. VERSES YOU WAIT. THREE I'M NOT CRITICIZING PERSON WAITING THREE DAYS AT HOME THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY PEOPLE THE LIGHTS. BUT THREE DAYS LATER YOU'RE SAYING WOULD NOT. BE COVERED BY THIRTEEN SEVENTY BECAUSE IT WAS NOT. IMMEDIATELY AFTER. RIGHT OKAY- AND IS THERE CASE LAW ON- AND I. AS A FORMER TRIAL LAWYER- TRYING TO DRAG MY MEMORY. IN TERMS OF- HEREI DON'T KNOW THE TIME IS OBVIOUSLY A- NOT A PRECISE- TIMING ARE ARE THERE IS THERE A WELL ESTABLISHED BODY OF. CASE LAW ABOUT WHAT. I AS INTERESTED WHAT QUALIFIES AS I DON'T GET WHAT. QUALIFIES AS NEAR. WELL I'M SANDERS YOU KNOW WASN'T AS A FORMER. HUNDRED FORTY DESPITE TECH A THE HEARSAY IRAQ. A SITUATION WHERE YOU'RE UNDER THE STRESS OF THE EXCITEMENT AT THE TIME THE STATEMENTS MADE. A STATEMENT COULD POTENTIALLY COME IN DURING THAT TIME BUT WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND WHY WE'RE LIMITING IT ONLY TO SITUATIONS WHERE THEY'RE FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR TREATMENT IS BECAUSE THAT'S WIDELY RECOGNIZED AROUND OUR OUR COUNTRY THAT THOSE ARE STATEMENTS THAT MAY OCCUR OUTSIDE OF THE TIME FRAME THAT ARE MEANT IT'S- DIRECTED UNDER THIRTEEN SEVENTY. AND I THE CASES ARE VERY CLEAR AS SUPPLIES TO THOSE AND THAT LAW IS IN A BROADER CONTEXT PERMITTED IN MINNESOTA IN- NORTH CAROLINA IN OREGON IN RHODE ISLAND AND IN THE FEDERAL RULES OF EVIDENCE UNDER EIGHT OH THREE FOUR AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT IN MICHIGAN VERSUS BRYANT FOUND THAT TO NOT BE CRAWFORD IMPLICATED. WE'VE HAD SIMILAR. WHERE ARE COURTS HAVE MADE COMMENTS TO THAT IN A CASE CALLED PEOPLE VERSUS CAGE AND THAT WAS THE CASE IN TWO THOUSAND SEVEN. THE COURT CONSIDERED TO PARTICULAR STATEMENTS OF A PARTICULAR SITUATION A STATEMENT MADE TO A DEPUTY SHERIFF. AS A RESULT OF A DOMESTIC VIOLENCE CASE IN A STATEMENT THAT WAS MADE TO A DOCTOR AT A LATER TIME. FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEDICAL TREATMENT AND THE HIGH COURT HERE IN CALIFORNIA SAID THOSE ARE VERY DISTINGUISHABLE ONE IS FOR THE PURPOSE OF PROSECUTION. WE CAN AGREE WITH THAT THAT IS- TESTIMONY NATURE. CONFRONTATION MUST OCCUR IF THAT STATEMENTS GOING TO COME IN. BUT THE CAGE COURT ALSO RECOGNIZED IN SITUATIONS WHERE WE'RE DEALING WITH STATEMENTS MADE TO A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL FOR THE PURPOSE OF. MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND TREATMENT THAT IS NOT TESTIMONIAL THEY SAID IT WAS NOT TESTIMONY EVEN WHEN THE DOCTOR WAS ASKING WHAT HAPPENED. FOR THE SANDERS- EDUCATION IT'S FORTY CALIFORNIA NINE SIX FIVE. FOUR BUT IN THE END THIS EXCEPTION TO YOUR POSTINGS ARE CREATED. IF THE PERSON SOUGHT TREATMENTS A YEAR LATER I WOULD ALSO QUALIFY UNDER THE HEARSAY RULE ON THE VEGAS EXCEPTION. IT IT. IT TECHNICALLY COULD YES FOR TWO YEARS LATER. IT ANYTIME WITHIN THE STATURE LIMITATIONS FOR. THE RECORD. OKAY ON IS YOU KNOW THE STATE OF THAT EVIDENCE IS GOING TO BE WEAKER THE LONGER ONE WAITS RIGHT RIGHT IT WOULD BE IMPEACHABLE IS WITHOUT QUESTION. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I'M I'M SORRY I WAS LATE TO THE PARTY SURE WERE WE ANY MORE WITNESSES. WE'RE NOT. ALWAYS BACK TO COMMITTEE OKAY ANYMORE QUESTIONS ARE COMING FROM- COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SENATOR SKINNER. ALL AGES FOR MISSING THE DISCUSSION SO FAR- BUT I AND MAYBE THIS WAS ADDRESSED SO BUT WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS I SAW THAT THERE IS. THERE ARE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL CAN YOU ENTER THIS HEARSAY EVIDENCE. AND IT'S NOT COMPLETELY PROHIBITED BUT ALSO SEE THAT WITH THE BILL'S TRYING TO DO IS HELP THOSE SITUATIONS WHERE THE VICTIM THEMSELVES IS NOT WILLING TO COME FORWARD. AND I DISCUSSED WHAT'S TRICKY FOR ME AS- WE NEED TO SUPPORT VICTIMS WE WANT THEM I DON'T MEAN SUPPORT WE NEED TO. CREATE A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE VICTIMS FEEL COMFORTABLE AND SO THAT WE CAN PROSECUTE THESE CRIMES AND SO THAT WE CAN TRY TO STOP THE CYCLE. HOWEVER WE ALSO KNOW THAT WORK AND EVEN WHEN WE PROSECUTE IF THE PERSON SAY IF IT'S A- YOU KNOW THEY'RE NOT- J. OLDER INCARCERATED THERE. THAT THE RETALIATION TO VICTIMS IS REAL AND- SOMETIMES THE VICTIM MADE. B. WISER ABOUT THEIR CIRCUMSTANCE AND SO I JUST I WAS REALLY STRUGGLING WITH. WHETHER THE REQUIREMENT WHEN IT'S IN EFFECT NOT SOMETHING THAT THE VICTIM WANTS TO HAVE PUT INTO EVIDENCE. IS GOING TO BENEFIT THE VICTIMS SAFETY AND THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN STRUGGLING WITH. AND I DON'T KNOW IF THAT WAS EXPLICITLY ADDRESSED IN THE PREVIOUS CONVERSATION. IF IT WASN'T BUT I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGES THAT- IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE IF I COULD ON THIS IT'S- YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT IT'S HARD TO GENERALIZE- I HAVE SPOKEN TO VICTIMS WHO- WHO HAVE MOVED OUT AND MOVED ON AND DON'T WANT TO SHOW UP IN COURT- BUT BECAUSE THEY'RE IN HIDING. AND SO THEY DON'T WANT TO BE THERE- AND- I. OBVIOUSLY HAVE DONE BILLS. TO- BECAUSE VICTIMS HAVE BEEN KILLED BECAUSE THEY THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO GET A WHERE THEY GOT AWAY AND- THE- PERPETRATOR WAS ABLE TO HUNT THEM DOWN AND SO. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE AN OPPORTUNITY AND I I'VE I OWE IT TO THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY SPEAK FOR THIS ISSUE THEMSELVES IS SAID- MY PERCEPTION THAT THERE'S IT'S A- IT'S A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE DA'S OFFICE AND THE VICTIMS AS TO EXACTLY HOW TO GET THEM OUT OF THE SITUATION AND- WHAT KIND OF TESTIMONY THEY CAN USE IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO PROVE THE CASE AGAINST. A PERPETRATOR AND SO IT'S NOT CUT AND DRY IN TERMS OF WHAT WHAT THEY WILL DO- BUT IT'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A DISCUSSION THAT HAPPENS AND MAYBE MAYBE- I MEAN THIS. IN A PERFECT WORLD THE DA WILL ALWAYS BE LOOKING OUT FOR THE VICTIM FIRST RIGHT AND WOULD CONSIDER ALL THAT THE WINNER PERFECT WORLD RIGHT. AND HOW. AND JUST WORRIED ABOUT. HOW IT COULD END UP USE BEING USED GIVEN THAT. THE. THE PERSPECTIVE OF FURTHER VIOLENCE IS SO COMMON IN THESE CASES I THINK THE AND DEATH THE I THINK THE EVIDENCE IS HAS SHOWN THAT WHEN YOU PROSECUTE. AND YOU CAN HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE THAT THE INCIDENTS OF DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IS REDUCED- AND THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS BILL IS TRYING TO GET TO IS THAT THE MORE THAT WE CAN. PROSECUTE YEAH I'M IF YOU END UP IN A GOING TO A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL IN AN EMERGENCY ROOM THEN IT'S SERIOUS- AND- THE ABILITY TO ACTUALLY HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE BECOMES VERY IMPORTANT. AND THAT'S THAT'S THE REASON FOR THE BILL IS THAT IT ALLOWS- A PROSECUTION. AND IT TO HOLD AND AN INDIVIDUAL ACCOUNTABLE UNDER CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE- THAT ARE INDIVIDUAL RIGHT BECAUSE THE PERPETRATOR HAS A RIGHT TO A TRIAL. BUT IT ALSO PROVIDES THAT THAT THE TOOLS TO BE ABLE TO USE SOMETHING THAT WAS DONE AT OR NEAR THE TIME OF THE- OF THE INCIDENT- THAT THAT'S DONE SPECIFIC FOR IT SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF MEDICAL ATTENTION. WE APPRECIATE WERE SOME TO A VICTIM MIGHT BE POTENTIALLY MORE COMFORTABLE IN THE MEDICAL SENATE SETTING AND MORE WILLING TO DISCLOSE HOWEVER AS I UNDERSTAND IT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS STATE IF THE VICTIM DOESN'T WANT TO TEST FOR THEMSELVES BUT THEY SAY YES PLEASE USE WHAT I SAID USE WHAT I SAID TO THE DOCTORS THAT THAT'S ALLOWABLE. NO OKAY SO- THIRTY MIND IF I ASK THE CONSOLE MAYBE I READ THE ANALYSIS WRONG HERE. SORRY. THE. HAS TO BE UNAVAILABLE FOR IT NOT JUST THAT THE WOULD GIVE CONSENT. SO WITH THIS WITH THIS RECORD SO IS THIS BILL REQUIRE AT LEAST THEIR CONSENT. CAN WE MODIFY IT TO AT LEAST ALLOW FOR THEIR CONSENT EVEN IF THEY ARE NOT WILLING TO TEST BY THEMSELVES. OKAY OKAY. WELL IT'S SOME LEVEL OF CONSENT WOULD. ONE IF I COULD ON THAT ON THAT LAST COMMENT ABOUT THIS THE SIXTH AMENDMENT AS THE COURTS HAVE HAVE- HAVE RULED AND APPOINTED THAT DAY SAYS SIXTH AMENDMENT DOES NOT APPLY TO SPECIFIC SITUATIONS WHERE YOU'RE GOING IN FOR A- IT IT AT EXCLUDES WHEN THE ISSUE HAS. TO DO WITH. MEDICAL GIVING INFORMATION FOR WHICH YOU NEED A MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AND MEDICAL TREATMENT. ALL RIGHT ANY FURTHER DISCUSSIONS OR DEBATES ON THIS ISSUE. SENATE KAMAR. THANK YOU I'D- ALSO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS AND WANTED TO ECHO SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT- SENATOR- SKINNER REYES I AM. I JUST AM TRYING TO ALSO FIND THE BALANCE. BETWEEN SAFETY AND JUSTICE AND PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS- I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK IN GENERAL TERMS BUT WE DO KNOW THAT- YOU KNOW. D. A.'S- DO M. VICTIMS I MEAN VICTIMS ARE PENNED BY A LOT OF GROUPS TO KIND OF FURTHER A PARTICULAR CASE. AND I'M ALSO CONCERNED THAT IF THERE WAS THIS EXEMPTION THAT WAS ALLOWED. THAT DA'S COULD ALSO AND- PEOPLE ARE VERY PEOPLE WHO KNOW THE LAW CAN BE VERY PERSUASIVE FOR GOOD AND FOR IN ALL. BUT I WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT THIS EXEMPTION WOULD ALLOW D. A.'S TO PERSUADE FOLKS- TO ALSO. BE PUT IN THIS CATEGORY THAT THEN WOULD ALLOW D. A.'S TO USE HERE. RATHER THAN HAVING FOLKS BE PRESENT TO SPEAK ON ISSUES AND THERE ARE MULTIPLE REASONS WHY. PEOPLE RE CAN'T AND ARE UNCOOPERATIVE SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE THEY DO FEAR FOR THEIR SAFETY AND SOMETIMES IT'S BECAUSE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER THINGS YOU KNOW LIKE IT WAS THAT MOMENT IN TIME THAT PARTICULAR SITUATION OR CIRCUMSTANCE AND SOMETHING ELSE GOT RESOLVED PEOPLE ARE NOT NECESSARILY THAT INTERESTED IN HAVING SOMEONE SWEPT UP BY THE CARCERAL SYSTEM. YOU KNOW NEVER TO LIKE COME OUT UNCHANGED AND- TO YOUR POINT THE END ITS ROOM IT'S UNFAIR TO MAKE GENERALIZATIONS BECAUSE EACH CASE IS OFTEN IS UNIQUE AND HAS ITS OWN SET OF CIRCUMSTANCES WHICH MAKE THESE THINGS OFTENTIMES REALLY COMPLICATED. SO IM JUST WONDERING. IF THERE ARE WAYS TO. IF THERE ARE WAYS TO PROTECT. FOLKS WHO. REALLY ARE SEEKING SOME PROTECTION- WHILE ALSO MAINTAINING SOMETHING THAT I THINK IS REALLY IMPORTANT WHICH IS DUE PROCESS AND HOW ARE YOU CARVING SOMETHING OUT IN A WAY. THAT STILL HOLDS ALL PARTIES ACCOUNTABLE AND I WOULD BE CONCERNED THAT YOU WOULD HAVE PROSECUTORS THAT WOULD THEN SEE THIS AS A LOOPHOLE. THE KIND OF SWEET PEOPLE INTO A CATEGORY. NOT HERE- AND I DON'T KNOW HOW FAIR THAT IS AND SO- BUT I HEARD FROM THE CONSULTANTS THAT IT'S- IT'S KIND OF BINARY IN TERMS OF WHAT THE BILL IT'S A IT'S EITHER THIS OR THE ASSETS NOT. YOU KNOW MAYBE UNDER PERJURY OR HAVING SOMETHING THAT CAN BE NOTIFIED NOTARIZED IT VERIFIED THAT THIS IN FACT IS THAT. I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO CONSIDER. I MEAN. IT'S SIMPLE I MEAN I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE TO BE ON THE RECORD. IN SOME WAY WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SOMEONE'S LIFE EVERYONE'S LIFE. AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT BALANCES. THAT SPEAKS TO THE INTENTION BEHIND THE BILL AND THE PEOPLE YOU'RE TRYING TO PROTECT. CARRIERS LIKE TO RESPOND TO THAT YES THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL IT- THE SENATOR SKINNER ASKED IF- IF- IF IT WOULD. THAT SHE ACTUALLY DIDN'T ASK QUESTIONS SHE SAID SHE'D BE MORE COMFORTABLE IF IT REQUIRED THE APPROVAL OF THE CONSENT IS A BETTER WAY TO PUT IT THE CONSENT OF THE VICTIM AND- AND I HAVE SENT THOUGHTSPOT ABOUT THAT TO SEE TO SEE WHAT. WHAT I THINK RIGHT- AND I DON'T I THINK THAT'S FINE I THINK THAT THE WHOLE POINT OF IT IS THAT- IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO SET UP ACCOUNTABILITY RIGHT. AND AND EQUITY AND WAIT TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE THE INFORMATION THAT WAS. PROVIDED TO A MEDICAL. PROFESSIONAL SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PURPOSES OF TREATMENT AND SO TO- TO REQUIRE THAT THERE BE CONSENT I DON'T THINK IS A FENCE ANYTHING I THINK THAT'S THAT'S APPROPRIATE AND- AND I WOULD ACCEPT THAT AS AS AN AMENDMENT THE OTHER AMENDMENT THAT I WAS PREPARED TO TAKE IS NOTICE BECAUSE THAT ONE OF THE ISSUES RAISED. IN INDIA A POST OPPOSITION LETTERS WAS THAT- THERE WAS NO NOTICE REQUIREMENT. OF THE INTENT TO USE THAT TYPE OF TESTIMONY AND I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH THAT EITHER- SO NOTICES WELL AS A CONSENT WOULD ARE PART ARE AT LEAST TWO PROTECTIONS THAT I THINK WOULD BE APPROPRIATE. COUNTS ARE WE CONSIDERING THOSE AMENDMENTS HEARERS IT ONTO JUDICIARY THAT YOU TAKE THOSE. WE CAN DO ONE THEN I WOULD FOR SHE'S GONNA TAKE FROM HERE. OKAY ALL RIGHT. ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THE SIGN. THIS CAN YOU RESTATE THE CONSENT AND NOTICE. HOW HIGH THAT AMENDMENT WOULD READ. WE SHOULD ACTUALLY DAMAGE A DISH BECAUSE BILL MAGICIAN NEXT WEEK OKAY- AND CAN YOU RSTATE WHAT YOU'RE WILLING TO TAKE- SENATOR CAFIERO YES THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO- REALLY THANK YOU FOR THE ROBUST DISCUSSION- WHAT WHAT HAS BEEN PROPOSED IS THAT- IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO UTILIZE- THE THAT INFORMATION. PROVIDED TO MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS UP FOR THE FOR THE PURPOSE OF- RECEIVING GIVING INFORMATION TO THEM AND RECEIVING TREATMENT THAT- THAT. IN ORDER TO USE THAT INFORMATION THE VET VICTIM WOULD HAVE TO GIVE HER KICK HIM OR HER CONSENT. AND AND IF THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED AT THAT THERE WOULD BE A NOTICE REQUIREMENT TO THE- THAT THAT INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER REQUIREMENTS THAT WE HAVE- AND I THINK THAT'S THIRTY DAYS BUT WHATEVER DAYS ARE APPROPRIATE THAT THAT WOULD BE FINE. I MEAN HE'S. THIS IS AN ISSUE SO THEN WOULD THIS TAKE CARE OF IT. I DON'T THINK SO. CAN WE GET OUR OPPOSITION WITNESS TO. ON RECORD YES OR NO. ARE THEY NO LONGER YOUR OWN CAR. WE DIDN'T SPECIFICALLY TAKEN ISSUE WITH NOTICE I BELIEVE MAYBE THE ACLU DID BUT GIVING THE DEFENSE NOTICE THAT THEY'RE NOT GOING TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO. CONFRONTATION IT REALLY DOESN'T SOLVE THE PROBLEM IN OUR OPINION. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT ARM SPINNER CABALLERO TOWARD CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I.

ELEVEN TEN DEALS WITH THE ISSUANCE AND RENEWAL OF WATER CALLED SIX OH TWO LETTERS SIX A TWO LETTER OR TRESPASS LITERATE THE WORDY IS A FORMAL REQUEST BY BUSINESS OR PROPERTY OWNER TO PROSECUTE ANYONE WHO WAS LOITERING OR ENGAGING IN UNLAWFUL ACTIVITY ON THEIR PROPERTY. THE LETTER GREATLY IMPROVES THE CITY'S ENSURES STABILITY TO ACT ON AGAINST UNDESIRABLE TRUST PASSERS AND FURTHER GRANTS LAW ENFORCEMENT PERMISSION TO ENFORCE TRESPASSING LAWS UPON IN WITHIN PRIVATE PROPERTY WITH OR WITHOUT A CALL FOR SERVICE. COMPLETION OF A SIXTY TWO LETTER AUTHORIZES LAW ENFORCEMENT TO REST AND OR ISSUE CITATIONS TO TRUST PASSERS FOR UP TO TWELVE MONTHS FROM THE DATE THE LETTER WAS SIGNED CURRENTLY THE SIXTY TWO LETTERS MUST BE COMPLETED ANNUALLY REQUIRING PROPERTY OWNERS TO RENEW THESE TRESPASS LETTERS YEAR AFTER YEAR. MY COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND PROCESSESBETWEEN TALIBAN AND A FIFTEEN HUNDRED OF THESE LETTERS ANNUALLY. IN IN MY CITY ALONE THE SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT PROCESS A TOTAL OF. THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO LAYERS JUST THIS LAST YEAR. THE OF THIS BILL IS TO ALLEVIATE THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT OF LAW ENFORCEMENT STAFF TIME IN CITY TIME DEVOTED TO PROCESSING THESE LETTERS BY EXTENDING THE LIFE. BY ONE YEAR STAFF TIME IT COULD BE BETTER SERVED HELPING OUR NEIGHBORS IN KEEPING OUR COMMUNITY SAFE. BEFORE ENERGIES MY WITNESSES HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL I WANTED TO THANK THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION. FOR WORKING WITH MY STAFF AND AMENDMENTS THAT WOULD ALLEVIATE THEIR CONCERNS. AND SAID THE MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE ARE AWARE I WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL TO ADDRESS THE FOLLOWING CONCERN SHOULD THE BILL PASS OUT OF COMMITTEE TODAY. NUMBER ONE REDUCING THE TIME IS SIX OH TWO LETTER REMAINS IN EFFECT CURRENTLY A FIVE YEARS DOWN TO THREE YEARS. DURING A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP WHERE THE PROPERTY HAS A SIX OH TWO LETTER ON FILE THE NEW OWNER WILL BE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT OF A CHANGE IN OWNERSHIP. OTHERWISE THE SIXTY TWO LETTER WILL EXPIRE NUMBER THREE ALLOWING LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ACCEPT ELECTRONIC SUBMISSIONS. ARE SIXTY TWO LETTER APPLICATIONS TO ALLEVIATE THE BURDEN OF HAVING PROPERTY OWNERS HAVING TO PHYSICALLY COME INTO THE OFFICE TO FILE THEIR LETTERS. WITH ME HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL A SURGEON WHO WE ARE DELEON FROM RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT. AND MAYOR BEN BEN RIGHT FROM. WELL THE MARKET IS ON THE PHONE LINE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN I ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS. WELL FOR BOTH YOUR WITNESSES TWO MENTION SUPPORT. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE- MY NAME IS WILLIAM A SERGEANT WITH THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY SHERIFF'S DEPARTMENT AND ONLY HALF OF A SHARE CHAD BIANCO WE ASK FOR YOUR I. BOATS TODAY- OUR DEPARTMENT OPERATES OUT OF FOURTEEN INDIVIDUAL PATROL STATIONS AND PROVIDES POLICE SERVICES TO SIXTEEN CONTRACTS CITIES WITHIN OUR COUNTY ONE OF WHICH IS WELL THE MARK. OF THE SECOND WITNESS IS IT THE MAYOR WILDEN MARC WILL TOMORROW YOU WILL HEAR FROM THEM SHORTLY. MANY OF OUR LOCAL BUSINESS OWNERS CONTACTED CENTER MENENDEZ'S OFFICE AS WELL AS OUR DEPARTMENT AND ASKED IF WE COULD REVISE THE TRESPASS LETTER- LAW TO MAKE IT MORE ACCOMMODATING FOR BUSINESS OWNERS WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION- FOR REFERENCE OUR DEPARTMENT PROCESSES BETWEEN TWELVE HUNDRED FIFTEEN HUNDRED TRESPASSERS ANNUALLY. MORE SPECIFICALLY ARE LARGE. AND VALLEY STATION. PROCESS FOUR HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE LETTERS LAST YEAR. EXCUSE ME. AND LIKE I ALSO LEARN A PROCESS THREE HUNDRED THIRTY TWO LETTERS LAST YEAR. WE ESTIMATE THAT OUR EMPLOYEES OVERSEEING THE LETTERS AT EACH STATION GENERALLY A COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICER SPENDS ROUGHLY 2025% OF HIS OR HER AT TIME ANNUALLY PROCESSING. FILING THESE LETTERS THE SERVER INTO OUR PATROL STAFF. AND- AND PURGING THESE LETTERS SO 252025% OF THIS TIME- IS SPENT JUST ON THESE LETTERS ALONE BY ONE DEDICATED EMPLOYEE AT EACH OF OUR STATIONS- WE ESTIMATE THAT WE CAN REDUCE THIS BY 10% IF THIS BILL PASSES- THAT WOULD ALLOW OUR COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICERS TO BE OUTMORE IN THE COMMUNITY AND BENEFITING THE COMMUNITY BY. IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THAT IS OUR JOB COMMUNITY SERVICE OFFICERS- THE AMENDMENTS TO A SIX OH TWO. I WILL RELIEVE BUSINESS OWNERS AND THE REGIONS OF THE BURDENS OF RENEWING. THE REQUEST ANNUALLY- THEY REDUCE THE NUMBER OF HOURS EMPLOYEES SPEND. AND IT ALSO AFFORDS OR PREVENTS FRAUDULENT REQUEST BY RECORD BY REQUIRING THE REQUEST TO BE IN WRITING AND ARREST. THIS BILL DOES NOT ADD ANY SENTENCING ENHANCEMENTS AND DOES NOT ADD ANY CRIME- IT DOES NOT INCREASE THE AUTHORITY OF LAW ENFORCEMENT TO ENFORCE TRESPASS LAWS ON PRIVATE PROPERTY. IT MERELY EXTENDS THE TIME FOR RENEWAL WHICH IN TURN REDUCES THE AMOUNT OF HOURS SPENT. BY OUR PERSONNEL TO PROCESS THESE LETTERS. I UNDERSTAND OR SOME INITIAL OPPOSITION'S OPPOSITION TO THE LANGUAGE OF THE BILL- BY SEVERAL ORGANIZATIONS BUT I BELIEVE THE AMENDMENTS. THAT HAVE BEEN MADE- CENSUS BILLS INTRODUCED MEDICAID SO CONCERNS. AND PROVIDE A STRAIGHTFORWARD RESPONSE- AND IS BETTER FOR BOTH BUSINESSES BUSINESS OWNERS AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST RIVALS ON THIS BILL PLEASE BURDEN TO BUSINESS OWNERS REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME OUR DEPARTMENT OR SPEND ANNUALLY.

WE HAVE TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS AS THE FOR THE FOR AS AMENDED AS A AS AMENDED- SB ELEVEN TEN MELENDEZ DO PASS AS AMENDED BRADFORD. BRADFORD AYE CHOI BOGUE TROUBLE GUY COME LONGER. KAMLAGER AYE KINNER SKINNER AYE WIENER WIENER AYE FIVE TWO ZERO THE MEASURE HAS FIVE VOTES IT'S OUT CONGRADULATIONS NEXT UP IS SB THIRTEEN FIFTY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I'M HERE TO PRESENT ALEXANDER IS A LOT SB THIRTEEN FIFTY WHICH AIMS TO REDUCE SPENT NO FATALITIES IN HOLD DRUG DEALERS ACCOUNTABLE LAST YEAR THE UNITED STATES SEPARATE MORE FENTANYL RELATED DEATHS AND GUN IN AUTO RELATED DEATHS COMBINE. FENNEL IS ESTIMATED TO BE UP TO FIFTY TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN HEROIN AND AS HIGH AS ONE HUNDRED TIMES MORE POWERFUL THAN MORPHINE. THERE WAS A 4100% INCREASE IN FEDERAL RELATED DEATHS BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN. IN TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN CALIFORNIA EXPERIENCED THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF DRUG FATALITIES IN THE NATION WITH NEARLY- JUST OVER SIX THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS DYING FROM DRUGS. ACCORDING TO THE DA SIM SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS OVERDOSE DEATHS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY FENTANYL INCREASED BY OVER 55% JUST IN ONE YEAR'S TIME BETWEEN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY IN JANUARY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS ALEXANDER COUPLE LEO DIED OUT I KNOWINGLY CONSUMING FIVE TIMES THE FATAL AMOUNT OF ILLICIT FENTANYL AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH HER FAMILY EVER SINCE FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS TO CRAFT A THOUGHTFUL PROPOSAL. I'M THIS BILL DOES NOT PUT PEOPLE BEHIND BARS IT IT DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE ANY DISTRICT ATTORNEY WILL TELL YOU THAT THIS ADVISEMENT THERE WE ARE ASKING FOR IN THIS BILL IS PURELY NOTIFICATION TO A PERPETUAL DRUG DEALER THAT THEY COULD BUT NOT NECESSARILY WILL BE CHARGED WITH MURDER THIS IS MUCH LIKE THE WATSON ADVISEMENT FOR DRUNK DRIVING SB THREE FIFTY THIRTEEN FIFTY EXCUSE ME APPLIES AN ADVISEMENT FOR AN INDIVIDUAL CONVICTED OF ILLEGALLY MANUFACTURING OR DISTRIBUTING FENTANYL TO MAKE IT CLEAR THAT IF THEY CONTINUE WITH THESE ACTIONS COULD RESULT IN THE DEATH OF ANOTHER HUMAN BEING AND LEAD TO A HOMICIDE CHARGE. THIS BILL HELPS PROSECUTORS KEEP UP WITH THE INCREASED AND DEADLY DRUGS BEING SOLD ON KNOWING CONSUMERS ESPECIALLY WHEN THERE'S CONSUMERS ARE OUR CHILDREN THIS POLICY IN HIS ATTEMPT TO PREVENT FUTURE FATALITIES BY GIVING DRUG DEALERS A CHOICE A CHOICE THAT COMES WITH CONSEQUENCES MAY SAID EARLIER THIS BILL PROVIDES AN ADVISEMENT IT DOES NOT PROVIDE SERRATION. TWO GRAINS OF SALT CAN BE ALL IT TAKES TO CAUSE A FATALITY ONE WITH RESPECT TO FEND OFF. IN LAFAYETTE NOISE PEDDLED AS AN OXY AS A PERCOCET AS EXAM AXE OR EVEN BABY ASPIRIN THE RESULTS ARE DEADLY AND YES BABY ASPIRIN A POLICE CHIEF IN SPOKANE WASHINGTON INDICATED THEY'RE BEGINNING TO NOW SEE FENTANYL DISGUISED AS BABY ASPIRIN TABLETS. ALEXANDER COUPLE IT WAS POISON IN THIS MANNER WHEN SHE PURCHASED WHAT SHE THOUGHT WAS OXYCODONE BUT WAS ACTUALLY FENTANYL. ALL OF THESE THINGS COMBINE EASY ACCESS THAT THAT HAVING THE BILL IS BEING MADE TO LOOK LIKE A LEGITIMATE PRESCRIPTION OR OVER THE COUNTER PILL. THE MEDICINE IN THE POST CFN BE A DEATH SENTENCE IN THE ARAFAT NO EVEN JUST HALF A PILL CAN TAKE A LIFE REGARDLESS. OF WHETHER THE PERSON KNOWINGLY CHOSE TO CONSUME IT. NOW SADLY ALEXANDER'S FAMILY IS NOT THE ONLY ONE TO EXPERIENCE THE LOSS OF A CHILD IN CALIFORNIA ALONE. BUT NO DEATHS ROSE ONE HUNDRED AND FORTY SIX PERCENT. FROM THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TO THE YEAR TWENTY TWENTY. SENATOR WIENER IN YOUR DISTRICT AND SAN FRANCISCO FATALITIES DUE TO DRUG POISONINGS OUTPACED KEVIN NINETEEN FATALITIES IN TWENTY TWENTY. WHEN I BEGAN WORKING ON SB 35050% OF ALL DRUG POISONING AND FATALITIES IN JORRIT LOS ANGELES DISTRICT SENATOR COM LONGER AND SENATOR BRADFORD THEY WERE TREATED TO FENTANYL AS TO STICK THAT HAS NOT WAVERED. LAST YEAR AN ORANGE COUNTY FENNEL ACCOUNTED FOR UP 264% OF DRUG FATALITIES WE HAVE WAITED LONG ENOUGH. TO GET A HANDLE ON THIS EPIDEMIC THAT IS KILLING CALIFORNIANS. WITH MEHERE TODAY AGAIN IS MATT KAPPLER THE FATHER OF ALEXANDER KHAPLU SPONSOR OF THIS BILL WHOSE DAUGHTER WAS KILLED BY FENNEL AND TOM WOLFE. A FORMERLY HOMELESS FORMALLY INCARCERATED RECOVERING DRUG ADDICT AND THEY'RE BOTH HERE TO SHARE THEIR EXPERIENCES AND WHAT HAPPENED- WITH YOU AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR I. ABOUT. A I'M SORRY MR CHAIRMAN IF I COULD JUST ADD THAT IF THERE HAPPENED TO BE ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS RELATING TO THIS BILL THAT I CANNOT ANSWER I'M DISTRICT ATTORNEY MORGAN GEYER FROM PLASTER COUNTY IS ON THE PHONE LINE. THANK YOU THANK YOU WILL GIVE YOUR TWO PRIMARY WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH TO BEGIN THAT. MAKE YOUR TESTIMONY- pWILL FOR MR. HAVE A LOT OF. pWILL FOR MR. HAVE A LOT OF., THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH ALL OF YOU AGAIN. I CAME HERE TODAY HOPING THAT THIS WILL BE THE LAST TIME I COME HERE TO ASK YOU TO NOT ONLY CONSIDER CALIFORNIA STATE SENATE BILL THIRTEEN FIFTY BUT TO MOVE IT THROUGH. FOR A VOTE ON THE FLOOR. ALEXANDER'S LAW AS YOU KNOW IS NAMED AFTER MY DAUGHTER. BUT THIS BILL IS ABOUT FAR MORE THAN THE EMORY OF MY DAUGHTER STRUCK DOWN INTERVIEWS BY THE DRUG DEALER WHO TRADED HER LIFE FOR PROFIT. IT'S ABOUT SAVING THE LIVES OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU HOW THE ROLE OF FAT AND ALL THESE COUNTERFEIT PILLS ARE WREAKING HAVOC UPON OUR COMMUNITIES AND TODAY YOU HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PUT A FORMIDABLE DEBT IN THOSE TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE LITERALLY A MATTER OF LIFE. AND DEATH. MY HOPE TODAY IS THAT YOU WILL SEE THE VALUE OF A BILL THAT MIRRORS THAT OF WATSON'S LAW. A BILL THAT HAS VERIFIABLE DATA SHOWING SIGNIFICANT EFFECTIVENESS IN REDUCING DRUNK DRIVING DEATHS. WELL THE ISSUE OF FAT AND ALL COMING INTO THIS COUNTRY FROM MEXICO VIA CHINA ITS MAMMOTH. WE IS CALIFORNIANS HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO PERSUADE DRUG DEALERS AT THE RISK OF PEDDLING THESE DEATH TOLLS WILL BE TOO COSTLY FOR THEM PERSONALLY. OUR GOAL WITH THIS BILL IS NOT TO THROW THESE GUYS IN JAIL IT'S TO DISSUADE THEM FROM TRADING THEIR OWN FUTURE TO MAKE A PROFIT. OFF OF THE POSSIBLE DEATHS OF OUR FRIENDS NEIGHBORS AND LOVED ONES. CALIFORNIANS VALUE SAFETY AND THE RULE OF LAW THEY KNOW THE DANGER IF AT ALL AND WHAT IT IS DOING TO OUR COMMUNITIES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT TAKING THIS STEP IS GOING TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE. AND I AM BETTING THE MAJORITY OF STATE REPRESENTATIVES WILL STAND UP FOR THE REST OF US AND TAKE ACTION TO SAVE LIVES IF GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY. I IMPLORE YOU PASS THIS THROUGH YOUR COMMITTEE GIVE US ALL A LITTLE MORE FAITH IN OUR GOVERNMENT AND LET ALL OF OUR STATE REPRESENTATIVES MAKE A DECISION ON THIS. IF NOT ANOTHER YEAR WILL GO BY. THOUSANDS MORE WILL DIE AND I'LL SEE YOU HERE AGAIN NEXT YEAR. I WON'T GIVE UP ON SAVING LIVES. AND NEITHER SHOULD YOU. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. NEXT UP IS MISTER WORF. GOOD AFTERNOON SENATORS THANK YOU FOR TAKING THE TIME. MY NAME IS THOMAS WOLFE TODAY I'M AN ADVOCATE FOR RECOVERY BUT FOUR YEARS AGO TODAY I WAS HOMELESS ON THE STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO HOPELESSLY ADDICTED TO HEROIN AND FENTANYL. I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY TO ASK THAT YOU CONSIDER MOVING S. B. THIRTEEN FIFTY FOUR FOR A FULL VOTE. THE DRUG OVERDOSE CRISIS OF QUICKLY SPIRALED OUT OF CONTROL IN CALIFORNIA. OUR STATE HAS BEEN FLOODED BY NEW SYNTHETIC DRUGS SPECIFICALLY METHAMPHETAMINE AND ILLICIT FENTANYL. THESE SUBSTANCES HAVE NOT ONLY CONTAMINATED THE STREET DRUG SUPPLY BUT THEY'VE ALSO BECAUSE THE THOUSANDS TO DIE OF OVERDOSE AN UNINTENTIONAL POISONINGS I PERSONALLY KNOW A LEVIN PEOPLE THAT HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF FENTANYL OVERDOSE. THIS ADMONISHMENT IS THE FIRST STEP IN ACKNOWLEDGING THE DRUG DEALERS ARE WILLFULLY SELLING THE SOME SUBSTANCES TO UNSUSPECTING CONSUMERS. AND WHILE I AGREE THAT FOR THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE THAT USE THE SUBSTANCES IT IS A HEALTH CRISIS. WE MUST ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ELEMENT INVOLVED FOR THOSE SELLING IT. IMAGINE IF YOU WENT TO A BAR AND THE BARTENDER GAVE YOU A DRINK. THAT WAS INTENTIONALLY LACED WITH ARSENIC HAPPENING HERE. INDIVIDUALS ARE SELLING FINAL SOMETIMES LACED INTO OTHER DRUGS WERE DISGUISED AS A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT DRUG ALTOGETHER. MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD CREATES A DETERRENT FOR DEALERS THAT SEEK TO MAKE A QUICK PROFIT OFF OF THE MOST DEADLY DRUG TO HIT OUR STREETS IN HISTORY. IT CREATES ACCOUNTABILITY AND GIVES YOU AN OPPORTUNITY TO BRING THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IN LINE WITH THE TWENTY TWENTY TWO NATIONAL DRUG CONTROL STRATEGY. RELEASED LAST WEEK BY THE WHITE HOUSE THAT STRUCK A BALANCE BETWEEN SUPPORTING HARM REDUCTION IN DRUG TREATMENT. WHILE COMMITTING THREE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO FIGHT DRUG TRAFFICKING. IT IS MISLEADING TO CONFLATE DRUG USERS WERE DRUG DEALERS THERE IS A DIFFERENCE I KNOW. I USED TO BE A MULE FOR A LARGE ORGANIZED DRUG DEALING NETWORK IN SAN FRANCISCO THE CONTROLS THE MAJORITY OF THE DRUG MARKET IN THAT CITY TODAY. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE DOING. THEY KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SELLING. AND EVERY DAY WE LET GO. BY WITHOUT TAKING ACTION MORE INNOCENT PEOPLE DIE FROM OVERDOSE. AND FENNEL POISONING. IT'S TIME TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM MUST WORK TOGETHER. IN FACT IT IS THE PATH FORWARD. THANK YOU. WE'RE GONNA PASS FOR NO APPLAUSE WE HAVE NO DEMONSTRATIONS IN THE CHAMBER THANK YOU- NEXT REMOVE UP TO MOVE TO OUR- WITNESSES HERE PRESIDENT WHO WANTS.

THANK YOU MADAM VICE CHAIR- FIRST OF ALL I AM EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENTS CENTER I DO WANT TO. APPRECIATE YOUR ON. YOUR STICK TO IT IS MASSIVE I KNOW IT'S NOT A WORD NATION WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE MAY HAVE DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES ON THIS BILL STEMS FROM THIS JUST UNBELIEVABLE SOCIETAL TRAGEDY ON DISASTER THAT WE'RE EXPERIENCING AND- I HAVE NOT LOST A FAMILY MEMBER TO DRUGS SO I WILL I DO NOT I CANNOT. GET UP HERE AND SAY THAT I UNDERSTAND WHAT THESE FAMILIES HAVE DEALT WITH- I'VE LOST A FAMILY MEMBER OF THE **** DRUGS AND SO I AM FROM THE BOTTOM OF MY HEART- I AM SO. SORRY FOR YOUR HORRIFIC TRAGEDY FROM THIS POISON AND IS POISON I AGREE THAT IS POISON- I HAVE HOWEVER AS MR WALLS- AND COULD I REPRESENT A CITY THAT HAS BEEN DEEPLY. MONTEL I FOUND ALL THE OTHER DRUGS AS WELL I COME FROM A COMMUNITY SPECIFICALLY. HAS BEEN COMPLETELY HORRIBLY IMPACTED BY MATH LONG BEFORE ANYONE KNEW WHAT SENTINEL WAS AND MANY OF US HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR MANY MANY YEARS. TO TRY TO REDUCE USE- AND TO TRY TO. YOUR IMPLEMENTED INTERVENTIONS SO THAT PEOPLE CAN STAY HEALTHY AND TO THE PEOPLE SURVIVE- AND I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE OVERDOSED I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME HOMELESS- BECAUSE OF DRUG USE I KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN HORRIBLY PEOPLE WHO BECOME HIV POSITIVE IN CONNECTION WITH A DRUG USE- PEOPLE WHO- HAVE IT TO THE LIST GOES ON AND ON THIS IS A REFLECT SOCIETAL PROBLEM AND IT'S GETTING WORSE- THERE ARE NOW DRUG MARKETS IN THE US THERE ARE. MARKETS FOR ILLICIT DRUGS IN THE US RIGHT NOW WHERE YOU CANNOT PURCHASE HER WIN ANYMORE HAVE COMPLETELY READ SUPPLANTED HER ONE BECAUSE THEY'RE CHEAPER. AND SUCH AS FENTANYL AND CARFENTANIL AND ALL THE OTHER ONES BECAUSE THEY ARE CHEAPER AND THEY'VE SUPPLANTED IT. AND THEY WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPLANT- AS LONG AS THE MARKET EXISTS. BECAUSE IF THERE'S ONE THING WE'VE LEARNED FROM THE FIFTY YEAR WAR ON DRUGS IS THAT. WE CAN MAKE THE PENALTIES HARSHER AND HARSHER AND HARSHER IT DOESN'T REDUCE DRUG USE IT DOESN'T REDUCE DRUG DEALING IT DOESN'T REDUCE OVERDOSES IT DOESN'T REDUCE. POISONINGS IT DOESN'T REDUCE DEATH. IT NEVER HAS AND IT'S NOT GOING TO- AND I ALSO JUST WANNA I WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE SAME BILL. ON IT WAS YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE TESTIMONY TODAY FOCUS ON THE POISON THAT IS FUNCTIONAL SENATOR AGAIN I APPRECIATE YOUR DEDICATION IS BUT I WANT TO MAKE I WANT TO. JUST STATE MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE SCOPE OF THIS BILL AND I ASK YOU TO PLEASE TELL ME ANYTHING I GET WRONG ABOUT YOUR BILL YOUR BILL YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYONE. OKAY ON MY UNDERSTANDING OF THIS BILL IS THIS IS NOT. LIMITED TO ADULTERATED DRUGS WERE MISREPRESENTED DRUGS THIS IS DESTROYED THIS IS NOT. JUST ABOUT DRUGS WERE THAT HAVE BEEN LACED WITH SOMETHING. ELSE THIS IS WHY TO DRUGS OR SIMPLY WHAT THE- PERSON PURCHASED A DRUG INTENDING. TO TAKE A DRUG AS WELL. ON THE BILL DOES NOT JUST APPLY IT TO FANS AND ALL. IT APPLIES TO CODY SORRY CODEINE. BUDGET IN COCAINE METHAMPHETAMINES IRWIN POD PSYCHEDELICS. I'M MORE. DRUGS THAT DON'T HAVE TO BE ADULTERATED APPLIES TO A LONG LIST OF DRUGS NACHO'S SYNTHETIC OPIOIDS NONSENSE FRONTAL. AND THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE ADULTERATED OR MISREPRESENTED. AND THERE IS NO REQUIREMENTS IF IT IS ADULTERATED WITH THE PERSON ACTUALLY KNOWS KNOWS THAT IT'S ADULTERATED TO SOMETHING WRONG. WITH THE DRUGS. SO THE IF YOU WERE SOMEONE WHO WERE SELLING A DIME BAG OF COCAINE TO SOMEONE OR A SMALL AMOUNT OF MATH UNADULTERATED. NO LATE NOT LEAST OF ANYTHING SIDE DIME BAG OF COKE OR A SMALL AMOUNT OF MATH AND YOU GET ARRESTED AND PROSECUTED CONVICTED OF DRUG THANKS. YOU WILL GET THIS ADVISEMENT. WHAT. FIVE IT IS AND IT'S A REVISED INTO GETS PUT ONTO YOUR CONVICTION OF INTO THE THE DIME BAG OF COKE IN YOUR INFECTED AND THEN A YEAR LATER. YOU SELL ANOTHER DIME BAG OF COCONUT LACED WITH ANYTHING AND YOU'RE CONVICTED. THAT VICE MAN COMES AND- I CAN BE A PREDICATE FOR MURDER CONVICTION EVEN THOUGH FRONTAL HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THAT. IT WAS SOMEONE SELLING COCAINE TO SOMEONE WHO WAS INTENDING TO BUY COCAINE THAT'S HOW I READ- THIS BILL. AND SO. CAN WE ASK FOR SOME ORDER IN IN THE CHAMBER PLEASE THANK YOU- DO YOU WANT TO GO THROUGH I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS- THAT IS MY THAT IS MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL AND I PLEASE ASK YOU TO TELL ME IF I'M WRONG. OR MAYBE THERE'S YOU INTENDED SOMETHING BUT IT'S NOT WRITTEN THAT WAY I JUST WANNA. YEAH I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE AND SO- WELL FIRST OF ALL I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE MODERATOR HAS MORGAN DIAL ON THE PHONE LINE HE'S GOING TO ASSIST. ME WITH- SOME OF THE TECHNICAL QUESTIONS BUT IT. IN OUR MADAM MODERATOR NOW I GUESS- DO YOU HAVE MR GUILE ON THE LINE. ONE MOMENT AND I'M DOUBLE CHECKING OKAY WONDERFUL THANK YOU SO WHILE WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT MANY ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU'RE SUGGESTING THAT- IF SOMEONE IS- CONVICTED IN COURT AND THE ADMONISHMENT IS READ TO THEM AND THEN THEY DO IT AGAIN AND THEY COME BACK THAT THEY WOULD BE CHARGED WITH MURDER- THAT'S- INCORRECT ON THE LEVELS IN THAT. NUMBER ONE IT WOULD HAVE TO BE A CASE WHERE SOMEBODY ACTUALLY DIED AS A RESULT OF THE DRUGS OR SELLING. RIGHT AND I WANNA I SEE THAT I HAVE A CELL APART TO. AS YOU SAID THERE'S ONLY ONE QUESTION THAT. I FOR SOMEONE WHEN IT'S JUST IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SCOPE OF THE BILL AS RIGHT IN TERMS OF- IF I GOT ANYTHING WRONG THAT IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A ADULTERATED OR MISREPRESENTED IT'S NOT JUST FUNCTIONAL ALL THESE OTHER DRUGS AS WELL MAGIC MUSHROOMS CODY INVITED AND- MATHIS CETERA. AND THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT THAT YOU KNOW THAT THERE WAS ANYTHING WRONG WITH THE DRUGS NO YOU I MEAN THIS IS YOU ARE SELLING A DRUG THAT HAS SPENT UNTIL THAT KNOWING THAT YOU YOU KNOW THAT THAT'S TAKING PLACE AND YOU CONTINUE TO SELL BUT WE'RE IN THE BILL DOES IT WORK FIRST OF ALL DOES NOT LIMITED DEFENSE AT ALL AND IT'S NOT LIMITED TO. ADULTERATION MY READING OF THIS BILL IS THAT AGAIN HE'S YOURSELF A CLASSIC SOMEONE SAYS I WANT A DIME BAG OF COCAINE AND GOES AND BUYS A DIME BAG OF COCAINE FROM SOMEONE WITH NO FENTANYL AND IT'S A STRAIGHT UP COCAINE. AND THEN THE PERSON GETS ARRESTED. FOR SELLING COCAINE. CONVICTED FOR SELLING COCAINE ON ADULT. THEY WILL GET ADVICE ON. THAT'S HOW I READ THE BILL AND I I'VE IF I'M WRONG PLEASE TELL ME- OKAY. YES STEVE THE- MISTER BENNETT MODERATOR. DO YOU HAVE MISTER MORGAN GEYER ON THE LINE DIAL DIAL I'M SORRY I APOLOGIZE. I DID NOT SEE HIS LINE CONNECTED AT THIS POINT. AMONG THE PUBLIC LINE. MISTER MORGAN DIAL IF YOU ARE ONLINE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. HE'S COURTING MY STAFF HE'S ON THE LINE I THINK YOU MIGHT BE ON THE PUBLIC LINE. FILE CAN YOU HEAR ME. I THINK WE HAVE ELEVATORS A MOMENT PLEASE. I'M SORRY HE WAS- IDA IF THERE. CHECK OUT OF YOUR MIND PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. NO I'M SORRY HE IS NOT CONNECTED TO THE CONFERENCE. AND SO IS THE SENATOR- GOING FORWARD YOU KNOW I MEAN HE'S ON THE LINE SO I DON'T KNOW WHY BUT HE COMES ON HE CAN- AND SO THAT THAT THAT'S MY READING OF THE BILL IT'S A VERY SIMPLE BILL- IT'S. NO WELL I. IF THE READER OF THE FIGURE OUT WHY YOU. I'M NOT SURE IN THE MEETING I'M I'M CHAIRING THE MEETINGS SO WOULD YOU MIND JUST HOLDING OFF JUST ONE MOMENT. HE'S TALKING TO THE MODERATOR RIGHT NOW APPARENTLY SELL. MODERN TECHNOLOGY. I'M SORRY THIS IS THE AT&amp;T MODERATOR DID YOU SAY HE'S WITH SOMEBODY- NO MY STAND NOT WITH EACH. OKAY. OKAY I'M GETTING A MESSAGE FROM A DIFFERENT OPERATOR THAT HE IS WITH THEM SO HE SHOULD BE JOINING US SHORTLY I WILL LET YOU KNOW SOME OF THE VINE IS OPEN OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. MISTER DIAL YOUR LINE IS OPEN CAN YOU HEAR US. WE SHOULD HAVE. AND THE LATEST UPDATE AS HE DOES CONNECTED AMAZON BACKEND SO I WILL LET YOU KNOW WHEN HE IS BACK ON AND IS WIDE OPEN I APOLOGIZE FOR THE INCONVENIENCE. OKAY BUDGET. YEAH BOB SO MODE WHERE HE WHEN HE GETS ON HE CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M IF I'M WRONG BUT I THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE BUT WITH A COUPLE PARAGRAPHS LONG- AND IT CROSS REFERENCES THE SECTIONS OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE THAT CRIMINALIZE AGAIN A LAUNDRY LIST. OF DRUGS. IN FACT IN FACT THE- THE ADVISEMENT SPECIFICALLY EVEN SAYS CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES EITHER REAL OR COUNTERFEIT. SO THIS THIS IS A DRAMATICALLY BROADER BILL THEM. NONE THE POISONING BY FENTANYL- AND THEN THE BEEN THE VERY REAL ISSUE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE THINKING OF BUYING. A PERCOCET WRITTEN IN THERE BUYING. MATH OR WHATEVER THEY THINK THEY'RE BUYING IT HAS COUNCIL AND DISCOS DRAMATICALLY BEYOND THAT- AND THERE'S AND IF IT IS ADULTERATED THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT IN THE BILL. THAT YOU KNOW THAT IT WAS ADULTERATED. ON IT IT. AT THE BEGINNING THIS NOT ABOUT OF COURSE. BUT RATHER ABOUT NOTICE ON- I AM WHILE I AGREE WITH YOU AT THE BILL ITSELF DOES NOT IMPOSE A NEW SENTENCE OR CREATE A NEW CRIMES. WHAT IT DOES DO IS IT AND I THINK IT'S I THINK IT'S VERY MUCH INTENDED TO CREATE A BASIS THAT. IF A PERSON DIES IN A SECOND DRUG- TRANSACTION DRUG CELL- THEN THERE WOULD BE A BASIS AND MALICE BECAUSE OF HAVING RECEIVED ADVICE- FOR MANSLAUGHTER OR MURDER IN FACT THAT SPECIFICALLY PUT IN THE ADVISER YOU CAN BE CHARGED WITH VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER. OR MURDER CITING THE PURPOSE OF THIS BILL THIS IS JUST MY TAKE ON IT IS TO- SO THESE PEOPLE WILL BE CHARGED- WITH MURDER OR SOMETHING AKIN TO A SUBSET IF. THEY SELL AGAIN AND SOMEONE DIES- WHETHER OR NOT- THE NEW WELL WHETHER OR NOT IT WAS ADULTERATED AND WHETHER OR NOT I HAD ANYTHING TO. OF OFFENSE AND ALL AND THE LAST TIME YOU BROUGHT THIS BILL LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE I BELIEVE THE COMMITTEE OFFERED YOU AN AMENDMENTS. OF THE BILL I THINK WHAT A PASSED OUT OF COMMITTEE. KEEP THE BILL ON TIME. BUT PROVIDE THAT THE- IT WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COMMENCE AVIDIN. AND SUBSEQUENT- CRIMINAL PROSECUTION YOU TO NOT TAKE THAT AMOUNT WHICH WAS YOUR PROG A- AND I BELIEVE IT WAS PROBABLY BECAUSE- IT WOULD UNDERMINE THE ABILITY. TO CHARGE MURDER OR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER AND THAT SUCKS. RESCUES AND I SAY ALL THESE THINGS- WITH ENORMOUS RESPECT UNITED HAVE A DESPITE ARE SIGNIFICANT POLITICAL DISAGREEMENTS I THINK A VERY GOOD POSITIVE. COLLEGIAL RELATIONSHIP- AND I SUPPORT YOUR BILLS WHEN YOU BRING THE BILL'S EXPERTS MY BILLS- BY ON THIS ONE I THINK THAT THIS IS A BILL. THAT IS BEING PORTRAYED AS VERY NARROW ABOUT ABOUT FENTANYL POISONING AND NO AND GIVING NOTICE TO PEOPLE WHEN THIS WILL. ABSOLUTELY EXPLODE TRUCKS DRUG SENTENCING FOR AN ENORMOUS ARRAY OF DRUGS AND SITUATIONS HAVING NOTHING TO DO. WITH FENTANYL OR CARFENTANIL POISONING AND THAT IS VERY CONCERNING- AND THAT IS ONE HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT FOUND I'LL SPECIFICALLY- ABOUT IT. BOB EVANS. BOTH AND I IN THE SUB- NOT TO. AGAIN APPETITE NOT THE BEFORE US TODAY. OKAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS AND I YOU KNOW CERTAINLY ANTICIPATED THAT WEWOULD NOT SEE EYE TO EYE ON THIS BUT I DO WANT TO ADDRESS JUST TAKE A COUPLE OF THINGS YOU SAID RATHER THAN. LUMP IT ALL INTO MY CLOTHES- SO YOU KNOW LET'S REMEMBER THAT I MEAN FENNEL CERTAINLY IS MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THAN COCAINE OR MATH OR MATH EVEN. IN ITS- YEAH SOMEONE IS GOING TO COME FORWARD BEFORE JUDGING BE CHARGED WITH MURDER BECAUSE SOMEBODY INGESTED COCAINE THEY MAY VERY WELL COME BEFORE THE JUDGE AND BE CHARGED HER BECAUSE THEY INGESTED COCAINE THAT ALSO HAD FENTANYL IN IT THAT THAT'S THE FOCUS HERE BUT YOU ARE CORRECT IT DOESN'T SPECIFICALLY SAY AND SNOW IN HERE BUT THE FOCUS ON IT THE DEATH THAT RESULTS FROM THE DRUGS THAT ARE INGESTED AND STOP BY THE PER WHO NOT THOSE WHO HAS BEEN. THANK YOU HAS WARNED IN THE BLOOD THAT. TAIPEI BEHAVIOR IS DANGEROUS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GOING AFTER SO IN THAT RESPECT I DO FEEL. IT'S NARROW IN MY MIND CERTAINLY NOT IN YOURS- BUT- YOU KNOW THE GOAL IS TO HAVE FEWER PEOPLE SELLING THIS DEADLY DRUG WHICH AS YOU POINTED OUT NOW WE HAVE CARFENTANIL AND WHICH IS EVEN STRONGER THAN REGULAR FENNEL AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE UNFORTUNATELY CONTINUE. CHASING THE NEXT NEW DRUGS AND- HEROIN NOW IT'S- IT IN A LARGE PART IT'S NOT JUST THE BIGGER MARKETS IT'S A SMALLER MARKETS TO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO FIND IT BECAUSE THEY REPLACED IT WITH BENHAM BECAUSE IT'S CHEAPER AND IT'S EASIER TO MAKE IN THESE LABS AND- I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE NEXT THING IS GOING TO BE BY. IT AND DEADLIER. I UNDERSTAND THERE IS THE ARGUMENT THAT YOU KNOW THERE'S FOR EVERY DRUG DEALER THAT YOU TAKE OFF THE STREET ANOTHER ONE WILL TAKE HIS OR HER PLACE. AND THAT'S PROBABLY TRUE HELPER. WHEN THEY GET OUT OF PRISON THEY DON'T SPEND THAT MUCH TIME IN PRISON LET'S BE HONEST RIGHT NOW THAT SAME DRUG DEALER IS OUT. BUT SOMEBODY REPLACED HIM WHILE HE WAS INCARCERATED NOW YOU'VE GOT TO ON THE CORNER WE'RE INCREASING THE NUMBERS THE GOAL IS TO KEEP FROM HAVING TO TAKE PLACE AGAIN FROM HAVING ALL THESE PARENTS CAN FOR FROM LISTENING TO TESTIMONY SAYING I LOST MY ONLY CHILD I LOST MY GRANDSON I MEAN. I DON'T THINK. CARCERI OUR WAY OUT OF THIS THAT'S NOT MICHAEL IT JUST ISN'T. BUT I THINK WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY TO AT LEAST TRY. TO PERSUADE. SOME OF THESE FOLKS TO RETHINK THEIR LINE OF WORK TO RETHINK WHAT THEY'RE DOING- I MEAN WHAT ELSE ARE WE GOING TO DO ARE WE GOING TO LEGALIZE EVERY DRUG IN JUST SAY WELL IF YOU MAKE IT A LEGAL THEN. THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER EITHER- I HOPE THAT AT LEAST THAT TOUCHES ON THE YOU KNOW THE POINTS HE MADE LEAST FROM MY PERSPECTIVE- I BELIEVE HE IS CURRENTLY ON THE LINE OKAY MISTER GUILE ARE YOU ON THE ON THE TELECONFERENCE LINE. HE I AM ON THE LINE CAN YOU HEAR ME. PERFECT I CAN HEAR YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME YES SIR WE CAN- WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE QUESTIONS THAT SENATOR WIENER HAD FOR YOU. SURE AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE TECHNICAL DIFFICULTY- AND ALL OF GET RIGHT TO IT CENTER WE KNOW YOU BROUGHT UP YOU BROUGHT UP A GOOD POINT. THE ABILITY OF THE ADVISEMENT TO BE USED IN A FUTURE HOMICIDE PROSECUTION IS ONE FACTOR THAT GOES INTO A DECISION THAT A PROSECUTOR WOULD HAVE TO MAKE THE LAW OF IMPLIED MALICE HAS BEEN AROUND FOR A LONG TIME WE HAVEN'T USED IT IN. THE SITUATION THAT YOU PRESENTED EARLIER WHERE THERE'S A SMALL AMOUNT OF COCAINE SOMEONE SELL THAT- AND SOMEONE DIED THIS IS DIFFERENT FINAL IS CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE AND WHAT IT IS US REQUIRING. SOMEONE TO HAVE SUBJECTIVE KNOWLEDGE OF THE DANGER OF WHAT THEY'RE DOING WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT IN ORDER TO CONVICT SOMEONE OF MURDER WITHIN ADVISEMENT WITHOUT AN ARGUMENT BUT WHAT THIS DOES IS IT SAYS. IF YOU SELL DRUGS. YOU'RE ON NOTICE NOW THAT THE LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED BUT IF YOU KILL SOMEONE AGAIN IF YOU DO THIS AND SOMEONE DIES AS A RESULT. THE STAKES ARE NOW RAISED AND NOW YOU COULD FACE A HOMICIDE CHARGE BE THAT SOME SORT OF. CATEGORY MANSLAUGHTER OR MURDER SO IN THAT SITUATION WHERE SOMEONE SELLS DRUGS THERE THEN WHEN THEY ARE CONVICTED EITHER AT PLAY OR SOMETHING THEY ARE THEN GIVEN THE ADVISEMENT THAT SAYS. YEAH NOW NO YOU DIDN'T KNOW BEFORE BUT NOW YOU DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS POSSIBLE IF YOU DO THIS AGAIN. AND IF THAT PERSON DOES IT AGAIN AND THAT PERSON DIED. NOW THOSE STEAKS ARE RIGHT NOW WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO PROSECUTE FOR SOME SORT OF HOMICIDE BE A MURDER. OR MANSLAUGHTER SO IT DOESN'T MAKE IT ANY EASIER IT DOESN'T MAKE IT PRESUMPTIVE IT DOESN'T CHANGE A DRUG LAW WHAT IT DOES IT SAYS. IS WE CAN NOW USE THE FACT THAT YOU KNEW AS ONE OF THE PIECES OF EVIDENCE FOR US TO BE ABLE TO SAY YOU KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS. YOU CAN DISREGARD THAT DANGER AND YOU DID IT ANYWAY BECAUSE THE ESSENCE OF THE HOMICIDE IS SORT OF A DEADLY. APATHY IT'S A I KNOW IT. THERE AM I GONNA DO A ANYWAY. AND THAT'S WHAT THIS SEEKS TO DO AND FEDERAL HAS CHANGED THE LANDSCAPE WE DIDN'T NEED TO DO IT BEFORE IN THOSE OTHER TYPES OF CASES THAT. THAT YOU WOULD REFERENCE EARLIER BUT THIS IS SORT OF THAT ABSENCE OF. AHA I KNOW HOW DANGEROUS IT IS NOW YOU'VE TOLD ME. AND I DID IT ANYWAY I HOPE THAT HELPS CLARIFY SOME OF THAT OBVIOUSLY. WE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHER COUNTY TO ARE DOING THIS ALREADY IN SOME FORM BUT THIS IS A MUCH NEEDED TO ON A STATEWIDE LEVEL. TO MAKE IT CONSISTENT I'M HAPPY TO HAPPY TO. ANSWER ANY MORE QUESTIONS OR OR GO THROUGH ANY OF THAT. NO THANK YOU I. MINIMIZER THE THANK YOU- YOU CLARIFY THE PURPOSE OF THAT SIDE I KNOW NONE OF MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE BILL WAS WHAT WAS ACCURATE AND OBVIOUSLY WITH A DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVE ON THAT- SISTERS. THIS IS A COUPLE THINGS THE FINAL THINGS. COCAINE DOES KILL PEOPLE I KNOW SOMEONE WHO DIED OF A HEART ATTACK FROM COOKING. ON MATH SKILLS PEOPLE- YOU KNOW EVEN THOUGH IN SAN FRANCISCO. WITHOUT A LOT OF DENTAL DOES WE'VE GOT PLENTY OF. OVERDOSE DATHS FROM. ON LATEST MAPS. AND UNLEASHED HER WHEN- SO IT'S- DOES NOT DRUGS KILLING P. I AM AGAINST SUCH AS- A BROAD ARRAY- BUT I. THE DIALOGUE AND WE'LL JUST HAVE TO. AGREE TO DISAGREE ON THIS ONE. THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER- JUST A CRAZY- I KNOW IT WAS THE QUESTIONS ADDRESSED- DID YOU HAVE SOMETHING ADDITIONAL. OR JUST PERSONAL FURTHER COMMENT AT IF I'M ALLOWED TO I'M- SORRY ANSWERS QUESTIONS. I BELIEVE IT WAS YOUR ANSWER QUESTION WAS YOUR QUESTION ANSWERED BY THE DISTRICT ATTORNEY MR GUILE. YES I'M ALREADY HERE I HAVE NO PROBLEM- GETTING FURTHER ANSWER- BUT I MEAN I. BUT YEAH. YEAH IF YOU COULD JUST- PERHAPS LET THEM ADD TO BRIEFLY THAT WOULD BE GREAT SO PLEASE GO AHEAD WILL GIVE ME ABOUT A MINUTE IF THAT'S OKAY I UNDERSTAND IN IS. THE REASON FOR THE BROAD AMOUNTED OF DRUGS BEING PUT UNDER THIS BILL IS THAT FENTANYL IS NOW BEING FOUND IN EVERYTHING. FOR THINKING THEY'RE BUYING COCAINE PEOPLE ARE THINKING THEY'RE GETTING A MARIJUANA EDIBLE. THIS BILL SIMPLY ADVISES THAT DEALER OF THAT AND WARNS THEM OF THAT I WANT TO POINT OUT IS ONLY IF SOMEBODY DIES AS A RESULT OF THOSE DEADLY DRUGS. THAT THEY WILL BE POTENTIALLY PROSECUTED AND THAT IS AFTER THEY HAVE BEEN WARNED. I WOULD I WILL TURN THE QUESTION AND ASK WHAT IS AND REASONABLE ABOUT SIMPLY WARNING A PERSON TO STOP SELLING DRUGS BECAUSE THEY COULD POTENTIALLY KILL SOMEBODY. AND IF ONLY IF THEY DISREGARD THAT MORNING AND CONTINUE TO SELL ON SOMEBODY DIES IT'S ONLY THEN. IS THERE THE POTENTIAL FOR THEM TO BE CHARGED WITH MANSLAUGHTER OR MURDER. I WOULD LOVE AN ANSWER TO THAT- THIS TIME IS TO PROVIDE TESTIMONY NOT TO ASK QUESTIONS OF THE OF THE MEMBERS BUT I THINK YOU. MIGHT WELL I WILL BE YOU SIT HERE AND YOU SAY YOU SAY YOU'RE SORRY AND YOU CARE FOR US ALL THEN DO THE RIGHT THING AND PASS THIS BILL THANK YOU SENATE FOR THEIR INPUT. THANK YOU SIR. IN ORDER IN THE COURT IN. IN THE CHAMBER PLEASE THANK YOU- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS- SENATOR SKINNER. THIS IS A DIFFICULT. POLICY TO DISCUSS BECAUSE THE LEGITIMATE THE VERY LEGITIMATE. HI RUSSIAN AN EMOTION THAT ANYONE WHO LOST A LOVED ONE TO FEDERAL. OR TO ANY OF THE DRUGS FOR THAT MATTER FEELS LEGITIMATELY. FOR US AS POLICY MAKERS WE ALWAYS HAVE TO WEIGH. THOSE LEGITIMATE EXPERIENCES AND FEELINGS AND THEN WHAT WE ARE PUTTING INTO LAW. AND THE DIFFICULTY I THINK THE THING THAT VARIOUS OF THE MEMBERS WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITH BEFORE US. PERHAPS THE LANGUAGE STATED. THAT THE DRUG DEATH MINUTES IN OTHER WORDS HE ADVISEMENT WAS SPECIFIC THAT IT WAS A FENTANYL RELATED. I CAN'T SPEAK FOR EVERYONE ELSE BUT THERE MIGHT BE MORE WILLINGNESS IT IS TRUE THAT MOST OF THE DRUGS LISTED COULD BE. BUT IT DOESN'T MAKE THAT. SPECIFIC IT DOESN'T MAKE IT THAT IT MUST BE AT NO WAIT WOOD SHOULD ANY DRUG DEATH BE ANY WORSE BETTER OR- BUT THERE CAN BE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE ANOTHER DRUG ON THAT LIST NOTHING TO DO WITH FEDERAL WAS NOT ADULTERATED BUT IT WAS A PARTICULAR CIRCUMSTANCE OF THAT PERSON FOR EXAMPLE. AND THOSE THAT'S WHAT OUR COURT SETTINGS ARE TRYING TO DEAL WITH THIS WHOLE CONTEXT OF ANY. OF ANY CRIME THE CHARGES THAT ARE BROUGHT. AND IN OUR ENACTING OF LAWS WE HAVE TO BE CAREFUL NOT TO. OVER PRESCRIBE SOMETHING WHEN WE DON'T HAVE ALL THOSE CONTACTS AND SO. IF THIS. BILL WERE TO BE A WARNING VERSUS SOMETHING THAT COULD BE ALLOWED A GUARANTEED EVIDENCE WHEN WE CAN PROTECT THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE NEXT CHARGE. SUCH A WARNING AS A WAY TO HELP. PUBLIC SAFETY AND PROTECT LIVES I COULD SUPPORT. FOR POTENTIALLY IF IT WERE MODIFIED SWEET REALLY WAS SPECIFIC TO FENTANYL OR CARFENTANIL. BUT IN ITS BROADNESS. IT IS VERY HARD. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER. AMERICAN WATER. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I JUST HAD A QUESTION EITHER FOR THE AUTHOR OR FOR THE G. A. R. SO CURRENTLY. AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME- EXAMPLES OF THIS THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE NEWS BUT CURRENTLY THERE ARE INDIVIDUALS EITHER DEALERS WHO HAVE BEEN SELLING OR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE SHARING DRUGS THAT HAVE BEEN CHARGED WITH MURDER AND OR VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER WHICH I'M ASSUMING IS. AND INTENT OF THE BILL TO CHARGE PEOPLE AT SOME POINT WITH- MURDER AND IN THE INSTANCES WHERE THIS HAS HAPPENED PEOPLE HAVE DIED. FROM TAKING A DRUG THAT WAS LACED WITH FENTANYL SO THAT'S HAPPENING RIGHT NOW. SO MY QUESTION IS. IF THAT'S ALREADY AVAILABLE TO D. A.'S AND IF IT'S ALREADY A TOOL THAT'S BEING USED BY D. A.'S. HOW DOES THIS DIFFER OR HOW DOES THIS ADD BECAUSE IT SEEMS TO ME THAT DA'S ARE ACTUALLY. LOOKING AT THE TOOLS THAT ARE IN THEIR TOOLBOX V. OF THE PENAL CODE AND ARE FIGURING OUT WAYS TO CHARGE. DEALERS IN THANKS WITH THESE KINDS OF CHARGES NOW. SO I DON'T KNOW IF ISN'T ALREADY AVAILABLE OR IF THIS IS AN ADDITIVE IN SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO ADD AND THEN IF MAYBE- YOUR WITNESS CAN ALSO SHARE BUT YOU KNOW I'M ASKING BECAUSE IT SEEMS LIKE IF THE DA WANTS TO CHARGE SOMEONE THEY CAN. ALREADY RIGHT THANK YOU- CENTER COMMONER FOR THE QUESTION I WILL HOPEFULLY THE MODERATOR STILL HAS DIEGO WHILE ON THE LINE. IS YOUR FINEST- GREAT LINE IS STILL OPEN OKAY AND SO- YOU CAN HEAR ME YES MORGAN PLEASE GO AHEAD. SURE AND I HAVE TO RESPOND BETTER WE CAN DO IT NOW IT'S INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT THESE CHARGES REQUIRED IF WE WANT TO SEE A MURDER CHARGE ON SOMEONE FOR. FOR SELLING. THAT ALTERNATELY KILLED SOMEONE WE HAVE TO PROVE THEY KNEW HOW DANGEROUS IT WAS. AND WE CAN DO THAT THROUGH THE EVIDENCE OF THE CASE BUT IT DOESN'T EXIST IN A LOT OF THESE CASES BECAUSE UNFORTUNATELY A NUMBER OF THE THAT RESULT IN CORNERS CASES AND THEY DON'T START I'M A SITE INVESTIGATION. WE TO BUILD. AND WHETHER. SOMEONE WHO CAN'T PROVE BECAUSE THE EVIDENCE ISN'T THERE WE DON'T HONESTLY THINK THEY DIDN'T KNOW HOW DANGEROUS THEIR BEHAVIOR WHILE WE DON'T HAVE A CASE WHAT THIS DOES IS PUT SOMEONE WHO ALREADY. BEEN FOUND RISK. I NOTICED THAT IT IS DANGEROUS BUT IF YOU SELL MATT IF YOU SELL COCAINE IF YOU TAKE BILL IF USED ANY. IT LIKELY AND VERY DANGEROUS AND YOU COULD KILL SOMEONE AND IF YOU DO THAT AGAIN THEN WE CAN PROVE IT YOU KNOW WHAT BECAUSE YOU DID YOU ABILITY TO DO IT IT'S JUST VERY DIFFICULT AND SO MANY OF THE PEOPLE I CAN TELL BY TODAY THEIR CASES HAVE. HAVEN'T COME TO FRUITION THERE HAVEN'T BEEN ANY ONE HUNDRED WILL BE GOOD ASSEMBLY THERE DURING. OR THIS YOUR PARTNER AND SAID NOW YOU KNOW THE POINT AS AS CENTER MY POINT GOAL IS TO PREVENT THAT IF THE SAY YOU KNOW WHAT DANGEROUS DON'T DO IT AGAIN IF YOU DO AND SOMEONE THAT THE RESULT. ALL YOU THAT WE ARE SEEKING TO PROSECUTE NOT ANYONE WHO JUST SELL DRUGS BUT SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THAT IT'S DANGEROUS. THIS ALL OF YOUR THAT DANGER AND OTHER AND THAT'S TRUE IF YOU ARE DEALING WITH GUNS IF YOU'RE DRUNK BEHIND THE WHEEL AND NOW SELLING DROP BECAUSE THAT MAKES IT VERY LIKELY BE OKAY THAT YOU'RE BUYING OR THE PILL THAT YOU'RE BUYING IS GOING TO BE SPENT ON THAT. TO BE FAIR HAVE EVER IT US PROVE THAT NOW OR IF WE DON'T HAVE WE HAVE HOPE THAT SHOWS A LITTLE BIT OF LIGHT ON ON HOW THAT ADVISEMENT WORK IT DOES BUT IT ALSO IT IT M. HAS REVEALED ANOTHER QUESTION IF I MAY WHICH IS THAT YOU SAID IT ADVISEMENT PROVES THAT THEY KNOW BUT IT. LET DO SO ADVISORY STAY BE PROVIDED THE DEFENDANT WRITING YOU'RE A PLEA FORM OR AFTER SENTENCING. SO A THAT WOULD SUGGEST TO ME. THAT I'M- THE FIRST STEP IS NOT JUST GETTING AN ADVISEMENT THE FIRST STEP IS ACTUALLY A CHARGE- AND THOSE AND SORE AND IF YOU WORK THAT THROUGH YOU'RE EITHER EXCEPT IT PLAYED. THE- OR YOU'VE BEEN CHOI. YOU SAY THE VIOLENCE WOULD PROVE THAT THEY KNOW- IN I WOULD LIKE AN EXPLANATION TO THAT BECAUSE HOW I READ IT YOU WOULD GET AN INVITE AND ADVISEMENT. AFTER THE FACT. SO IS THE ENVIRONMENT VOLUNTARY. I MEAN BECAUSE YOU COULD HAVE. WHICH DOESN'T MEAN YOU KNOW PLEA MEANS ACCEPT THE PLEA RIGHT AND I CHARGE MEANS YOU'VE BEEN CONVICTED- OR SENTENCING MEANS THAT THIS PROCESS HAS HAPPENED WITH THE COURTS SO CAN YOU OPT TO NOT HAVE THE SIZE PUT IN YOUR BECAUSE YOU SO ATTACHED ARE YOU NOTING. IS TO MILLIMETER ANSWER WHATEVER EXACTLY WHAT IS IN IT SO IS THE BISON BOND HERE YOU CAN YOU TO NOT HAVE. BECAUSE YOU DON'T NOW OR DOES IT I'M WITH YOU IT DOES IT IN THE NEAR FILE REGARDLESS. SO THERE ARE THERE ARE THERE ARE. CASES WHERE THIS IS IT IS RELEVANT TO ON ON SOMEONE'S CONVICTION FOR SALE THAT DOES NOT INVOLVE THE DEATH OF SOMEONE. SOMEONE IS CONVICTED FELON BURKE UP THEY EITHER PLEASE THE DAUGHTER THEY WERE CONVICTED BY A JURY. ULTIMATELY AT THE CONCLUSION THAT CASE OF ARE FOUND RESPONSIBLE ONE OF THOSE TWO IT. WILL BE GIVEN BY. BY THAT YOUR CON. THIS CASE WHAT YOU DID BY SELLING OUR PRODUCTS YOUR NOW GO OF WHAT YOU ARE DOING IS DANGEROUS AND IT COULD GO SOMEBODY AND IF YOU DO IT. COULD BE ON THE HOT LAW AND THAT IS THE ADVISEMENT THAT WOULD ONLY COME INTO PLAY SHE- DO THE AGAIN. YOU AND I WANT TO THE RESULT THEN BY. FROM PRIOR. YEARS NOW. ELEVEN ARCADE WE PAY DANGEROUS IT WAS BECAUSE YOU WERE TOLD. RIGHT CLARIFY THAT. IT DOES I'M ONE OF THE ONLY TIME WE WOULD USE THAT IN THE FUTURE RIGHT I APPRECIATE M. THE RESPONSE I'M JUST TRYING TO- THINK. ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WITH PRACTITIONERS IN THIS FIGHT. YES BUT JUST BECAUSE YOU'RE ADVISED DOESN'T MEAN YOU WILL BE CHARGED WITH MURDER IT DEPENDS ON EVERY CASE IT DEPENDS ON THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAPPENED ON THE EVIDENCE EVERY PROJECT EIGHT AND THERE ARE THOSE WHO BOB WE WILL CAN'T WAIT OR DON'T WANT TO CASE IT MAY BE APPROPRIATE IF JUST ONE ADDITIONAL TO HELP ONE GET THE MESSAGE TO THE PARTICULAR DEFENDANT AND REYES. THE QUESTION IN THE FUTURE IF SOMEONE DIED AS A RESULT OF THEIR CONTINUED CONTACT. OKAY YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT THANK YOU QUESTIONS. I HAVE A JUST TWO QUESTIONS AND THIS THE FIRST QUESTION IS FOR THE SUPPORTER- ACTUALLY MISTER GUY WHO FOR THE DESCRIPTION HERE- I KNOW THAT SOME PROSECUTORS A STARE TRYING TO USE THIS FENTANYL ADVISEMENT IN COURT. HOW IS THIS ADVICE BEEN BEING RISK IT BY JUDGES AND DEFENDANTS IN THE COURTROOM AND HOW CAN SB THIRTEEN FIFTY BE HELPFUL TO THE D. A.'S. AND DOWN THE IN PURSUING THE SENTINEL CASE. BUT GOOD QUESTION SO THEY'RE ABOUT SEVENTEEN COUNTIES IN COUNTING WHO ARE PROVIDING THIS ADVISEMENT THROUGH SOME FORM EITHER AT THE TIME OF THE PLEA AT THE TIME OF THE CERTAIN SOME B. ICER IN METHOD BY MANAGER WHEN SOMEONE IS CHARGED NUMBER HOW MANY OF THE- SOMEWHAT MIXED. SOME JUDGES. SOME ARE HESITANT TO DO IT I'M DOWN TO GO SHOOTING WHETHER NOT THAT SHOULD BE DONE OR COULD BE DONE SO THE END RESULT IS IT'S WORKING IN SOME COUNTIES BUT WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHAT INCONSISTENT SO AS THIRTY THREE ONE IT. EIGHT MESSAGE WHEN SOMEONE ALL HELD FOR THE SELLING OF NARCOTICS THAT ADVISE MINUTES BUT WE ALL HOPE AND PRAY THAT THE LAST BY THERE WERE NEEDED FOR YOU KNAPPER'S CASE PERCENT YEAH BUT IT WOULD MAKE IT AN EFFORT ON THE PART. ALL MONEY LETTER THAT. PERFORMS COUNTY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR AND I DO HAVE A QUESTION FOR MR WELL ARE YOU STILL IN THE- THANK YOU SIR. MISTER WHAT DO YOU THINK THAT- DECRIMINALIZATION AND NOT PROSECUTING DRUG DEALERS HAS REDUCE THE AVAILABILITY AVAILABILITY OF DRUGS IN THE OPEN MARKET. SO AND THERE'S A STATISTICS ACTUALLY BACKED UP RIGHT NOW SAN FRANCISCO WERE PULLING ONE POINT ONE KILOS ON AVERAGE PER WEEK JUST FROM THE TENDERLOIN OF JUST ILLICIT FENTANYL OFF THREE. WELL PASSED YEAR WE ARE THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHT DRUG DEALERS. ALMOST A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY OF THEM WERE REPEAT OFFENDERS. SO CLEARLY WHAT WE'RE DOING IN OUR CITY IN SAN FRANCISCO IS NOT WORKING AND IT'S REFLECTED IN THE OVERDOSE DEATHS LAST YEAR WE HAD SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY OVERDOSE DEATHS THE BOTTOM LINE. FROM THE HEALTH INSPECTOR. YOU KNOW JUSTICE PER. WE ARE APPROACHING THIS CRISIS AS IF WE WERE STILL DEALING WITH LOW GRADE STREET LEVEL HEROIN. BUT WE ARE NOT. NOW DEALING WITH A DRUG THAT IS FIFTY TO ONE HUNDRED TIMES STRONGER THAN MORPHINE. WHICH IS WAY STRONGER THAN BLACK TAR HEROIN WAS ON THE STREET SO WE MUST. STOP AND STEP BACK AND COULDN'T RECONSIDER OUR APPROACH FROM A PUBLIC HEALTH PERSPECTIVE AND A CRIMINAL JUSTICE PERSPECTIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR. OUR NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WERE COLLEGE THE NEW MELINDA'S WHICH I CLOSE I WOULD THINK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- FIRST LET ME SAY THANK YOU TO- THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS AND QUESTIONS THOUGH CLEAR. NOT A LINE- I DO APPRECIATE YOUR QUESTIONS AND SEEKING CLARITY ON THE BILL AND I ALSO WANT TO THANK- ALL THE WAY WHO ARE TO A AND IT IS- YOU KNOW IT'S NOT THING THAT THEY- LIVE WITH. A. I HAVE DONE THIS BILL I DON'T SLEEP THE NIGHT BEFORE MY STOMACH IS IN KNOTS I CAN'T IMAGINE WHAT THESE PARENTS FEEL LIKE SO I WANT TO THANK EVERYONE NATIONALLY THE DEATH RATE FROM THESE DRUGS HAS INCREASED AND YOU'VE HEARD THE STATISTICS BUT IT IS INCREASED BY ABOUT OVER A ELEVEN AND TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN AND OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE IT AT SKEWS ME OVERDOSE DEATHS HAVE INCREASED IN EVERY MAJOR DEMOGRAPHIC GROUP BUT THE NOTE BROUGH SEEN BIGGER INCREASE IN DEATHSTHAN THE BLACK COMMUNITY. AS MORE. SB THIRTEEN FIFTY DOES NOT CREATE A DRUG INDUCED HOMICIDE CHARGE AS IT WAS EXPLAINED BY THE DA AND MYSELF THIS IS AN ADMONISHMENT IN COURT. SO THAT WE CAN HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THEY WILL BE CHARGED WITH MURDER MEANS THE POSSIBILITY IS THERE BUT MOST IMPORTANT. IS THAT WE GIVE THE ADMONISHMENT AND THAT THEY KNOW THAT NO ONE IN FUTURE CAN SAY I HAD NO IDEA. THAT FENTANYL THE SIZE OF TWO GRAINS OF SALT COULD KILL ANOTHER HUMAN BEING. THEY CAN'T SAY THAT ANYMORE. THE GOAL IS INCREASING. EDUCATION IF YOU WILL IT IS NOT ABOUT INCARCERATION. THESE DRUGS ARE UNFAIRLY TARGETING IMPOVERISHED COMMUNITIES ACCORDING TO THE L. A. TIMES DRUG OVERDOSES WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR JUST UNDER 30% OF THE ALL THE DEATHS OF HOMELESS IN TWENTY TWENTY THAT WAS THE LEADING CAUSE. THIS BILL WILL FORCE DRUG DEALERS TO MAKE HARD CHOICES AND TO BE AWARE OF THE CONSEQUENCES OR BENEFIT TO GO ALONG WITH THAT CHOICE LIKE ANY OTHER RESPONSIBLE ADULT BUT THE UNWILLINGNESS. TO ADDRESS THE FINAL EPIDEMIC ON THE CHANCE THAT IT WOULD INCREASE INCARCERATION LEVELS IGNORES THE FACT THAT SO MANY PEOPLE ARE DYING FROM IT IF YOU CAN'T SAY IT'S GOING TO INCREASE. THE NUMBER OF BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE WHO ARE INCARCERATED WITHOUT ALSO. THANK NUMBER BLACK BROWN PEOPLE WERE DYING FROM THIS DRUG ARE INCREASING AS WELL MORE SO THAN THOSE- BEING INCARCERATED FOR SELLING THESE DRUGS. THIS IS NOT A RACIAL ISSUE- I WANT TO TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE- ARGUMENTS THAT THE OPPOSITION- MADE THOUGH I'VE SPOKEN TO SOME OF THOSE ALREADY BUT I WILL SAY THAT- LET'S SEE THEY SAID. THE STATE SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO SPEND FUNDING ON INCREASING INCARCERATION LEVELS THAT WE SHOULD FOCUS ON EVIDENCE BASED PRACTICES OKAY WELL IN NINETEEN EIGHTY BEFORE WE ENACTED STRICTER DRUNK DRIVING LAWS WE HAD ABOUT TWENTY FIVE. CALIFORNIA IN THAT YEAR WHO WERE KILLED IN DRUNK DRIVING FAST FORWARD TO TWENTY TWENTY ONE AFTER WE PUT THE ADMONISHMENT IN PLACE FOR D. WISE THAT NUMBER WAS CUT IN HALF. SB THIRTEEN FIFTIES A WARNING FROM THE COURT ENSURING THAT A CONVICTED INDIVIDUALS EDUCATE ON THE DANGERS OF DEALING LESS HOT FENNEL SAME AS WE DID FOR DRUNK DRIVING. THE OPPOSITION ALSO SAID THAT A CONVICTED DEALER FACE MURDER CHARGERS CHARGES CAN ARGUE THAT INDIVIDUAL CHOSE TO CONSUME. TOO MUCH HEROIN OR WHATEVER THE DRUG WAS- IT IS UNLIKELY THAT SOMEONE THE VERY FIRST TIME THE USE HEROIN. IS GOING TO DIE FROM IT IT IS. VERY LIKELY THAT SOMEONE WHO TAKES SPENT NO FROM THE FIRST TIME IN THE WRONG AMOUNT WILL DIE FROM IT THAT'S GUARANTEE AND FIT IN MY OPINION THAT'S VICTIM BLAMING LIST OF DRUGS I AGREE. IT'S DANGEROUS AND YOU JUST YOU SHOULDN'T BE DOING IT BUT WE DON'T BLAME THE VICTIM. I MEAN IT'S SIMILAR TO WHAT I THINK THOMAS SAID EARLIER WHERE IF- YOU KNOW IF OUR KIDS WERE DRINKING UNDER AGE WHICH- A LOT OF KIDS DO AND A LOT OF. MEMBERS OF THIS LEGISLATURE PROBABLY DID SOMETHING LETHAL. IN ALCOHOL WOULD BE OUTRAGED. SO WHY ISN'T ANY DIFFERENT WITH THIS I AGREE PROBABLY SHOULDN'T BE BUYING. PERCOCET OR IS AND WHATEVER ELSE IT IS FROM SO CLOSE THAT OUT BUT PEOPLE ARE DOING IT DOESN'T MEAN THEY DESERVE TO DIE IT. AND HE GOES UNDER RAY ABOUT THIS. ABOUT WHAT WE DON'T WANT INCARCERATE MORE PEOPLE WELL THAT'S NOT THE ANSWER WELL THERE'S ANOTHER DRUG DEALER WHO WILL STEP INTO THEIR PLACE OKAY SO THEN WHAT. WHAT WHAT DO WE DO NOTHING DO WE JUST SAY YOU GOT US THERE'S NOTHING WE CAN DO I MEAN IS THERE EVER A PROBLEM THAT COMES. THIS BODY THAT IS A WEEK SOLVENT OF COURSE NOT. WE DELIVERY UNDER THIS TIME THINGS THAT. BUT WE CAN'T SOLVE FOR DECADES. WE SURE AS HECK TRY CHANGE TO PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES YOU NAME IT WE TACKLE IT. BUT CHECK YOUR ISSUE WE JUST CAN'T SOLVE THERE'S JUST NOTHING WE CAN DO I'M JUST. I DON'T THINK THAT THAT'S TRUE AND I HONESTLY I UNDERSTAND. YOUR POSITION THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO PUT MORE PEOPLE BEHIND BARS I DO BUT YOU KNOW WHAT I DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE PEOPLE PUT IN THE CAVE I THINK THAT TRUMP'S PUTTING PEOPLE BEHIND BARS. WHAT IASK WE HAVE NO DISPLACING NEITHER POSITIVE OR NEGATIVE HERE PLEASE NO CLAPPING. OVER YOUR TURN I DON'T WANT TO PROLONG THIS DISCUSSION BUT I THINK IT'S A UNFAIR CHARACTERISTIC TO INDICATE THAT THERE'S NO WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND SETTING. THIS IF WE WERE BEING ASKED TO MAKE AN ADVISEMENT THAT WAS RELATED SPECIFICALLY TO FEDERAL AND TO THE TO THAT AND AS YOU POINTED OUT THE- TRAVIS. SOMETHING THE QUIBBLING OF TWO GRAINS OF SALT CAN KILL YOU AND THAT IT IS IT IS. RAMPANT IN ALL THE DIFFERENT DRUGS THAT PEOPLE THINK ARE PERHAPS JUST. KNOCKS ECONOMY FOR JUST. OR JUST A HYDROCODONE BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT IS BEFORE US AND SO I JUST THINK IT'S FAIR TO PUT ON THE RECORD AS MUCH AS YOU PUT YOUR FOOT ON THE CLOTHES. PUT THE RIGHT. D. AS POLICY ME. COMMITTEE ARE REALLY BEING ASKED TO VOTE FOR. AND IF I WERE BEING GIVEN SOME ALTERNATIVES I COULD SUPPORT. SIR CHAIRMAN BRADFORD ST STE. THE DISCUSSION AGAIN I'D LIKE TO JUST ADD SOMETHING THAT THE FIRST TIME THIS BILL CAME THROUGH- S. ME CHANGES. TO J. YES. FIFTY TWO THIS. THEY'RE WILLING TO MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD IF WE NARROW IT DOWN TO JUST FENNEL THEN TELL ME THAT NOW AND WE CAN ALL WORK TOGETHER AND MOVED OVER WITH THAT'S THE STATE POINT YES- WINNER. YEAH ON IT YOUR INITIAL COMMENT. SENATORS DINNER YOU YOU'VE TOUCHED ON IT TWICE NOW IS. IS THAT THE COMMITTEE'S POSITION THAT YOU WANT IT NARROWED TO J. BECAUSE A THE. THERE ARE ALWAYS HAPPY TO WORK WITH ANYONE AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO HAVE FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THAT OPINION THAT WAS PUT FORWARD LAST YEAR OR THE YEAR BEFORE. HERE'S A THE OTHER DAYS- NOT BE ADMISSIBLE SIR AND THE SUBSEQUENT PROSECUTION SO THAT IT WOULD BE ABOUT EDUCATION AND TELLING PEOPLE- AND YOU TO STEP BACK AND THAT WAS YOUR PROGRESS- YOU HAVE- KNOWING WAS IN THE DRUG OR WHAT THE DRUG. THERE ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF A DIFFERENT I'M GONNA HAVE TO SIT DOWN WITH YOU AND TALK FENTANYL'S IMPACTING ALL OF OUR TO REFER WHAT KIND OF HAPPY TO CONTRA. WAS NOT THAT WAS A ONLY. ISSUE SURE SEEKING A MOTION ON THOSE MEASURE TO PASTURE CORPORATIONS IS THERE A MOTION. HE'S BEEN MOVED BY SENATOR TROUBLES. HI THIS IS MEGAN.

CAMARGO NOT VOTING SKINNER INTERNAL VOTING WIENER WIENER NO VOTES ONE TO ONE ARE WE WILL REMOVE YOU FROM THE CHAMBER WITH THOSE DISPLAY OKAY THANK YOU BYE THANK YOU. WATER. THE EVERY THERE WAY. WE'RE WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE THAT KIND OF LANGUAGE IN HERE OKAY SO YOU CAN YEAH YOU KNOW. YEAH ALL RIGHT. YEAH OKAY ALL RIGHT. HERTZBERG YOU READY CAN YOU FOLLOW THAT. YOU KNOW YEAH. WE'RE WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA CALL A RECESS WE'RE GOING TO BE A RECESS. WHEN ASKED TO WAIT ONE MORE MINUTE CENTER HERTZBERG BUT YOU'LL BE PRESENTED AS THIRTEEN TWENTY. ONE BURKE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. IT'S HARD WORK THANK YOU. THIS BILL IS ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE GUN VIOLENCE. GUN VIOLENCE HAS EXPLODED IN OUR COMMUNITIES OF THE LAST FEW YEARS MUCH. THE INCREASE VIOLENCE IS FROM THE USE OF ILLEGAL WEAPONS WEAPONS THAT THE REVERDY BRUCE LAW PUT IN PLACE AND I THINK IT WAS EIGHTY NINE AND THEN PRODIGY TO GHOSTS AND NINE I BELIEVE. THE FARM'S USE JUST THE OTHER WEEK THIS MASS SHOOTING IN SACRAMENTO. STOLEN AND CONVERTED TO BE USED AS FULLY AUTOMATIC WEAPONS. SO CALLED GHOST GUNS ARE TO BLAME. THESE WEAPONS ARE EITHER MADE OF POLYMER PARTS CREATED BY THREE D. PRINTERS OR OR A GUN OR LITERALLY YOUR FILING OFF THE SERIAL NUMBER. ON GHOST GUNS ARE RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE AND- BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT MADE BY LICENSE MANUFACTURES THEY LACKED THE SERIAL NUMBER OR AS I SUGGESTED THE SERIAL NUMBER'S BEEN REVIEW REMOVED MAKING THEM IMPOSSIBLE TO TRACE. HERE'S WHAT'S IMPORTANT BUT BUT I COME FROM IN LOS ANGELES R. LOS ANGELES POLICE DEPARTMENT RECENTLY DECLARED A GHOST GUN EPIDEMIC. CONNECT TO OVER TWENTY TWENTY ONE LOS ANGELES POLICE COMMISSION REPORT FOUND THAT THE NUMBER OF GHOST GUNS CAUGHT. APARTMENT JUMP 4100% SINCE TWENTY SEVENTEEN. IN THE FIRST ELEVEN MONTHS OF TWENTY TWENTY ONE OUR POLICE DEPARTMENT LOS ANGELES ON EVEN LARGER RISE COMPARED TO THE PREVIOUS YEAR SKYROCKETING UP TO ONE THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED AND EIGHTY UP BEING CONFISCATED TWO COMPARED TO ONLY EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY IN OAKLAND. BETTER BUDGET CHAIR OF THE ROUGHLY TWELVE HUNDRED FIREARMS SEIZED BY POLICE OFFICERS THAT YEAR. GOT A TWELVE HUNDRED WERE GHOST GUNS ACCORDING TO THE LOCAL POLICE DEPARTMENT LAST YEAR IN SAN FRANCISCO. MISTER WINNER. A POLICE. FOR SUCH GUNS AS A DECEMBER SEVENTH ACCOUNTING DEPARTMENT. THAT NUMBER HAS RISEN FAST IN RECENT YEARS JUST SIX SUCH GUNS WERE SEIZED BY SAMPRAS OF FISCAL POLICE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN. AND SO NO SUCH GUNS WERE RECOVERED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN. SIGNIFICANT CHANGE OF CIRCUMSTANCES WITHOUT QUESTION CALIFORNIA LEADS THE NATION IT ACTING ROBUST GUN LAWS TO PROTECT. OUR CALIFORNIANS. GOVERNOR NEWSOM. IS A FIERCE AND ROBUST LEADER AND ADVOCATE FOR COMMONSENSE GUN REFORM. HE SIGNED MULTIPLE GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION MEASURES INTO LAW SINCE HE WAS SWORN INTO OFFICE. AND YET THE DISTURBING NUMBERS REPORTED OUT OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS A JUST SUGGESTED DEMONSTRATED THERE'S STILL MUCH MORE TO BE DONE AND WE NEED TO GET CREATIVE. UNDER THE LEADERSHIP AT THE DIRECTION OF THE NEWSMEN MINISTRATION THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT THIS BILL DOES. THIS MEASURE SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN PROVIDES A SET OF NEW TOOLS IF YOU WILL AN INCENTIVE TO GET THESE DANGEROUS WEAPONS OFF OUR STREETS A PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT MECHANISM SPECIFICALLY MEMBERS. THIS BILL CREATES A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION ALLOWS ALMOST ANYONE TO BRING A LAWSUIT AGAINST THOSE p. IMPORT HELLO LEGAL WEAPONS WHAT IS THAT FIFTY CALIBER MACHINE GUNS. S. ILLEGAL GHOST GUNS AS I JUST SUGGESTED GOES KIND KIDS STOP WEAPONS. IN OTHER WORDS S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN GIVES PRIVATE LESSONS PRIVATE COMMUNITY MEMBERS. WORK CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THESE DANGEROUS WEAPONS A TOOL TO KEEP THESE WEAPONS OFF THE STREET. THIS BILL HARNESSES THE POWER OF A COMMUNITY. I DETERRENCE ABOUT IT WE DO IT IN MANY OTHER. WE DO IT WOULD PUT THE PICTURE UP IN THE POST OFFICE WE DO IT IN SO MANY OTHER WAYS WE LOOK. THE COMMITTEE. THE SACRAMENTO WHEN THEY'RE RELEASED TALKED ABOUT. THE PHOTOGRAPHS AND OTHER THINGS WHERE THE COMMUNITY WAS VERY INSTRUMENTAL. IN HELPING DEALING WITH CRIME. NOW A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION MEMBERS OF THE SHORT HERE. HE'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMETHING NEW IN CALIFORNIA. THE END WAS CIVIL RIGHTS ACT CIVIL CODE SECTION FIFTY ONE. PERSON MOTIONS OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS DISORDERS ALSO PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTIONS IN VARIOUS CONSUMER PROTECTION LAWS AND THE LIKE. NOW HE NUMBER TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE TEXAS STATE LEGISLATURE AT BASICALLY CREATED THIS PRIVATE ENFORCEMENT SCHEME ENACTED PRODUCE A SEVERE AND RESTRICTIVE ABORTION LAWS WHICH IS OWNING TECH SUCCESS BA WHICH ALLOWED ANYONE TO SUE. PROVIDERS AND OTHERS EIGHT IT AT TRAINING WORKSHOP. IF TEXAS CAN USE THE MACINNES TO TAKE A WOMAN'S RIGHT TO CHOOSE. ANY DANGER LIVES CALIFORNIA IS THE GOVERNOR HAS SAID CAN USE THE SAME MECHANISM TO BAND THAT THE WEAPONS OF WAR AND SAVE LIVES FURTHER THE SHIP'S COURT HAS ALLOWED SB EIGHT TO REMAIN IN PLACE. IF THIS PRESIDENT IS TO STAND THEN WE SHOULD USE IT TO GET AN ASSAULT WEAPON AND GHOST GUNS OFF THE STREET WE LOOK AT THIS IT'S VERY CLOSELY WITH THE DISCIPLINE COURT. AMIGAS BRIEFS- THE BY AN ORGANIZATION CALLED THE FIREARMS POLICY COALITION THE FIREARMS POLICY COALITION FILED THE BRIEF IT SAYS IF YOU JUST WITH THE PORTIONS THEY'RE GONNA COME ALONG WITH GUNS DO EXACTLY THIS THING. WE USED IN AND THE COURT HAD THIS POSITION FOR THEM WHEN THEY WERE CONSIDERING THIS AND SAID WISH HE- WAS. THE COST TO. OF THIS PER RIGHT OF ACTION WAY WE DID. IT IS NOT. THAT THE SUPREME COURT HAD THIS VERY ISSUE IN GREAT DETAIL BEFORE THEM. THIS BELT BILL MAY NOT BE THE PERFECT SOLUTION BUT IT OFFERS A CREATIVE TOOL NEVER USED OR TESTED BEFORE. IN MY JUDGMENT. WE HAVE A NUMBER. WHEN YOU. THAT ARE THAT HAVE CERTAINLY. REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE BY OVER 50% IN THE LAST NUMBER OF YEARS EVERYTHING THAT WE COULD POSSIBLY USE EVERY TOOL WE CAN FIND IN THE TOOLBOX. TO ME IS ANOTHER TOOL THAT WE SHOULD TRY TO EMPLOY TO PREVENT GUN VIOLENCE I ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. AND I BELIEVE WE HAVE FROM DEMAND ACTION FOR GUN SENSE OF CRYPTO LOPILATO I BELIEVE ON THE LINE SHE'S HERE IN THE ROOM OR NOT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU TO VOTE. YOU ARE YOU MISS LOPILATO MISSED.

CRISTALLO BLOTTO AND I'M A MOM LIVING IN THE BAY AREA I'M A VOLUNTEER LEADER WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF MOMS DEMAND ACTION FOR GUN SENSE. IN THAT ROLE I CONNECT WITH GUN VIOLENCE SURVIVORS PARENTS STUDENTS COMMUNITY PARNERS AND PEOPLE ALL AROUND THE STATE WHO WANT TO SEE CALIFORNIA LEAVE. A GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. I PERSONALLY STARTED VOLUNTEERING WITH MOMS DEMAND ACTION BECAUSE I WAS SICK OF FEELING HELPLESS EVERY TIME MY SON IS IN THE SCHOOL SHOOTING OR MASS SHOOTING. AND EVERY TIME I TALKED TO GRIEVING FRIENDS OR FAMILIES WHOSE LOVED ONES HAVE BEEN TAKEN BY GUN VIOLENCE. THIRTY NO SITTING ON THE- HUNDRED AND TEN PEOPLE ARE KILLED BY GUNS AND TWICE AS MANY ARE WOUNDED OF COURSE THOSE NUMBERS DON'T EVEN BEGIN TO CAPTURE THE ON GOING TRAUMA EXPERIENCE I FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES IMPACTED GUN VIOLENCE. WE KNOW AFFECTING SO MANY WAYS I KNOW YOU'VE ALL SEEN OR EXPERIENCED THE IMPACT OF GUN VIOLENCE IN YOUR DISTRICTS ARE RIGHT HERE FOR YOU BURKE AND FELT THAT SINKING FEELING. ANSWERS WE- AND BRING A NEW TOOL IN THIS THE ABILITY OF INDIVIDUALS TO BRING CIVIL SUITS TO READ OUR COMMUNITIES OF A GHOST ALL WEAPONS AND GHOST GUNS GUN VIOLENCE IDENTITIES ACROSS CALIFORNIA IN THE RIVER. THOMAS WIDE AS WE- FAMILIES TORN. HERE WE CAN'T SIT BACK AND HOPE THAT THE PEOPLE BRINGING THESE WEAPONS OF WAR INTO OUR STATE WILL SUDDENLY CHOOSE TO STOP. THIS BILL OPENS UP ANOTHER LANE TO PROACTIVELY ENFORCE PROHIBITIONS ON A LEGAL ASSAULT WEAPONS AND GHOST GUNS BEFORE THEY CAUSE INJURY DEATH OR TRAUMA IN OUR COMMUNITIES. FOCUSES ON GUN MANUFACTURERS BROADER IMPACT AND DOES NOT CREATE A PRIVATE CAUSE OF ACTION AGAINST INDIVIDUALS MAY BE PURCHASING OR ATTEMPTING TO PURCHASE THESE WEAPONS. FOURNETTE ALREADY DISTRIBUTE OR IMPORT ASSAULT WEAPONS WE ALSO ALREADY HAVE A LAW REGULATING THE SALE OF FIREARMS PRECURSOR PARTS THAT CAN GO INTO EFFECT IN JULY IN THIS VERY COMMITTEE HAS PASSED MANY SMART COMMONSENSE POP PIECES OF GUN LEGISLATION MANY OF WHICH RIGHTFULLY RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR A HOLISTIC APPROACH TO GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION. BUT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE A STRONG AS WE NEED BOLDER ACTION AND NEW APPROACHES TO TRULY AND THE PROLIFERATION OF THESE WEAPONS THIS BILL GIVES US ANOTHER WAY TO BE SURE THAT THE INDIVIDUALS IS WHO YOU TO BYE ARE BY BRING THESE WEAPONS INTO OUR STE.

I THINK THIS NOW THE HOMELAND AND I OPPOSE SB. THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENTS THANK YOU. YOU AFTER HEARING FROM BOTH SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION WE NOW BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE SENATOR WIENER. BY SENATOR WIENER ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND TODAY. ZERO CHOI BOOK. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK M. I HAD A QUESTION REGARDING THE USE OUTLINED IN. THANK YOU IN THIS COMMITTEE WE HAVE HAD MANY DISCUSSIONS ABOUT HOW ADDITIONAL CIVIL PENALTIES DO NOT DETER CRIME. I'M WONDERING. I AM WONDERING HOW THIS BILL IS ANY DIFFERENT TO THE VARIOUS OTHER BILLS WE HAVE HEARD ADVOCATING FOR ADDITIONAL PENALTIES. I THINK THAT THE QUESTION A THOUGH I HAVEN'T BEEN- IN THIS COMMITTEE ON A DAILY BASIS OF THE OIL AND HISTORY HERE THE PENALTIES THAT WE TALK ABOUT OUR GOVERNMENT PENALTIES IMPOSED UPON. PEOPLE AND WHETHER OR NOT THAT THOSE FEES AND FINES MAKES SENSE THIS IS DIFFERENT. THIS IS CIVIL PENALTY WHERE THE PERSON IS WHO'S GOING AFTER THE INDIVIDUAL AND CIVIL COURT CAN GET A RECOVERY- BOTH ATTORNEYS FEES AND TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER AND THAT WAS IT. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MEASURE. OUR FORTY NINE STATES DECIDES WITH CONSTITUTIONAL YOU KNOW. THEY DECIDE WHAT YOU'VE SEEN SO MANY CASES IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND VARIOUS OTHER THINGS AND WHAT THE SUPREME COURT SAYS FINAL COSTS MAIN COURT. THE SUPREME COURT MADE THE DETERMINATION THAT THIS TYPE OF PROCESS FOR CIVIL FOR PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION ARE CONSTITUTIONAL. AND SO. IS IT. TO SEE IF THIS OF THE CURRENT WITH ALL THE LAWS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA IS A SUGGESTED WE HAVE REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE BY 50% IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH SO EVERY TOOL THAT WE HAVE AVAILABLE IS DETERMINED TO BE CONSTITUTIONAL AND THIS MEANS THAT IF YOU'RE GONNA TAKE MONEY OF THE BANK ACCOUNT OF THE PERSON MAKING THE ILLEGAL OUTDOOR CAESAR AUTOMOBILE AT THEIR HOME MAYBE LACKED IS DETERRENT IN THIS PROCESS I DON'T KNOW BUT- SOME. THIS BECAUSE EVERYTHING. FINE AFFECTION STILL NOT ENOUGH. THANK YOU SENATOR HERTZBERG- AND ONE LAST QUESTION HOW LIKELY IS A CRIMINAL WHO IMPORTS ILLEGAL ASSAULT WEAPONS TO BE DETERRED BY ADDITIONAL CIVIL PENALTIES WHEN THEY AREN'T EVEN DETERRED BY THE RISK OF GOING TO STATE PRISON WELL THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION TO THE QUESTION IS WILL THEY WANT TO WE DON'T KNOW THE BOTTOM LINE IS TO NEUTRAL THE TRUCK IT'S ONE THING TO THINK ABOUT WELL I'M GONNA GO TO PRISON ARE GOING TO PRESENT. RELIGION YOUR CAR YOU HAVING TO GO TO COURT YOU COULD THEY HAVE A WHOLE HOST OF THINGS I DON'T KNOW BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT YOU KNOW WHAT I SHOWED YOU THAT FIRST OF ALL ANDREAS THE OPPOSITE DISTRICT ARE. PROVIDE PEOPLE OF YOU KNOW THE FOLKS IN THE CALIFORNIA RIFLE AND PISTOL. CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT TO AN ILLEGAL WEAPON. FOR THIS BILL ONLY DEALS WITH ILLEGAL WEAPONS POINT ONE. POINT TWO WE KNOW FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT 65% OF ALL OF THESE A GHOST GUNS FROM THE- TOBACCO FIREARMS FOLKS. ARE HERE CALIFORNIA WE KNOW OF THE BABBITT EPIDEMIC A CHILDREN OAKLAND SAN FRANCISCO AND LOS ANGELES. FOR THESE PARTICULAR TYPES OF WEAPONS OR IN FACT IS A CAUSAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THEM AND CRIME. SO IF YOU CAN TRY ANY NEW TOOL IN THE SUPREME COURT TO ITS INTERPRETATION OF THE LAW IN THIS. DO THAT SHOULDN'T WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY ASSIST ANYWAY WE HAVE SUCH EXTRAORDINARY. LET'S TRY EVERY HUNDRED SUN. AT HIS BACK WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS IF SOMEBODY'S QUINCES LAW PASSED THIS AND I HOPE IT DOES IN THE GOVERNOR SIGNS IT. CERTAINLY IT'S CLEAN HE. HIS IDEA CAN STILL HIS IDEA JUST OF WORKS ARE. THERE'S GONNA BE SOMEBODY'S GONNA TRY IT I GUARANTEE IS GOING TO GET A LOT OF ATTENTION AND WE'LL SEE WHAT KIND OF CHILLING EFFECT IT HAS ON FOLKS WHO ENGAGE IN USING THESE WEAPONS. THE SENATOR HERTZBERG BUSH COURSE OF COURSE THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. SKINNER THANKS SO MUCH AS CENTER HERTZBERG I REALLY WANT TO THANK YOU FOR BRINGING US THIS BILL- WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFICULT DISCUSSIONS IN THIS COMMITTEE WHERE WE ARE VERY COMMONLY TRYING TO. WE END UP. CRIMINALIZING IN EFFECT THE- NOT THE SOURCE SO WHEN WE THINK ABOUT. IT'S JUST A LOT OF ISSUES THAT WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE IF WE TAKE- OPIOID EPIDEMIC WE CAN TURN TO PURDUE- THE PURDUE- FIRST A COMPANY. AND THE VERY AGGRESSIVE THE BOTH THE CREATION OF A VERY STROKES AND VERY AGGRESSIVE MRKETING OF THOSE WHICH RESULTED IN MANY PEOPLE BECOMING ADDICTED AND THEN WHEN THEY COULDN'T GET THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS PURSUING. TO HELP FALLING INTO THESE- THESE HORRIBLE TRAPS IN WITH GUN VIOLENCE WE FIND A SIMILAR THING WHERE WE FIND THIS AGGRESSIVE MARKETING. BY NOT ONLY MANUFACTURES ASSOCIATION OF THE GUN MANUFACTURERS IN EFFECT FINANCE. AND YET THEY'RE RARELY EVER HOLD HELD RESPONSIBLE THEMSELVES AND SO I APPRECIATE THIS BILL BECAUSE REDUCE BEGINNING TO HOLD THE VERY SOURCE OF THE PROBLEM RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PROBLEM. AND AGAIN SUPPORTED APPRECIATED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SIR. SEEN NO FURTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS HERTZBERG TALKED CLOSE I THINK I ADDED THE ISSUES THAT I WANTED TO ABOUT THE LAWFUL USE OF WEAPONS AND THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS THAT THERE'S NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT. TO HAVE AN EAGLE ILLEGAL WEAPON THIS IS BEEN ILLEGAL IN CALIFORNIA SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE THERE'S NO FOCUS ON GOING AFTER FOLKS LAWFUL USE OF A WEAPON IT'S A FIFTY CALIBER MACHINE GUN WHICH I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO TO GO DEER HUNTING FACT. IS THE SHOP THAT'S CLOSE ISRAEL HEROES AND SUBSEQUENT AND BUY BEER GOES AND- BERADA AND IT IS A GHOST GUN THAT WE KNOW IS THERE'S AN EPIDEMIC ABOUT SO IT'S A VERY NARROW. SAID APPLICATION IT DOESN'T DEAL WITH PEOPLE'S CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS BECAUSE THERE'S NO CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHT FOR WHAT. THAT. I THINK IT'S A THE IT IS A GOVERNOR A DEAL OF. FOR HE WHAT HE'S DONE AND YOU KNOW I SUSPECT THAT WILL BE CHALLENGED AND THAT GIVEN THE SUPREME COURT WEWENT. WITH WITH THE LAWYERS FOR THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE AND MY OFFICE- WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME THINKING THROUGH THIS IN A GREAT DETAIL TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT WAS WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK THAT WAS SET FORTH BY THAT STATE'S SUPREME COURT IF THEY WANNA DETERMINE. CONSTITUTIONAL BUT RIGHT NOW THIS IS THE LAW AND WE FEEL LIKE WE'RE ON PRETTY SOLID GROUND AND WE THINK THAT GIVEN THE CHALLENGES WITH GUN VIOLENCE IT IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT NEW TOOL THAT THE GOVERNOR THINKS AND I THINK WE SHOULD ADD TO OUR LAWS IN CALIFORNIA THE STAFF AT LEAST HAVE SOME DETRIMENT. TO GUN VIOLENCE. AS FOR RIVAL MISTREATMENT THANK YOU. SENATOR A WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR WIENER WE HAVE A DO PASS. COUNCIL PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON S. B. THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN. THE PAST APPROPRIATIONS AND FOR OF SENATE PROBE CIRCA EXCEL LINK. THE WAIT MAYBE THIS. ELIZABETH IT'S A TO APPROACH YEAH THE PAST APPROPRIATIONS APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT WAS MY FORMER STAFFERS KNOW YOUR STAFF FOR. SB THIRTEEN TWENTY SEVEN BRADFORD. BRADFORD I'D SHOW VOGUE NO JO'BURG NO COM LONGER. SKINNER SKINNER AYE WIENER WIENER I'D THAT MEASURE HAS TO VOTE TO LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SENATOR NOW WE HAVE SENATOR GLAZERS BEEN WAITING PATIENTLY. HE'S PLANNING SB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT. THANK YOU AT YOUR BRADFORD GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS- FOURTEEN SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY FIVE IS AN IMPORTANT BILL THAT WOULD REDUCE BARRIERS TO RE ENTRY FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE RELEASED SAN APPLIES TO THOSE WHO WERE FOUND BY THE STATE TO BE INNOCENT OF THE CRIMES FOR WHICH THEY WERE IMPRISONED. WOULD ENTITLE THEM TO A CERTIFICATE OF INNOCENCE DOCUMENTING THERE IS THE FINDINGS OF THEIR INNOCENCE. WRONGFULLY CONVICTED INDIVIDUALS FACE MANY BARRIERS REBUILDING THEIR LIVES FOLLOWING A FINDING OF FACTUAL INNOCENCE. FOR EXAMPLE WHEN THEY APPLY FOR A JOB OR HOUSING PROSPECTIVE EMPLOYERS AND LANDLORDS. I CAN LEARN ABOUT THEIR CONVICTION AND INCARCERATION BY REVIEWING COMMERCIAL BACKGROUND CHECKS. ONLINE RESEARCHER EVEN EMPLOYMENT OR RENTAL HISTORIES. BUT THOSE SOURCES TYPICALLY DO NOT LATER AND DAUGHTER REDUCTIONS. OR FINANCED BY THE STATE OF FACTUAL INNOCENCE AS A RESULT EMPLOYERS OR LANDLORDS HAVE NO REASON TO BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICANTS WERE EXONERATED AND FOUND INNOCENT. AND INDIVIDUALS HAVE NO SIMPLE WAY TO PROVE OTHERWISE. SB FOURTEEN SIXTY EIGHT WOULD PROVIDE INDIVIDUALS FOUND TO HAVE BEEN FACTUALLY INNOCENT A CERTIFICATE OF INNOCENCE. THAT THEY CAN PROVIDE TO THEIR EMPLOYERS OR LANDLORDS THAT INDICATE ONE THE DATE OF THE CONVICTION AND ITS REVERSAL. TO THE DURATION OF THE INCARCERATION AND POST RELEASE RESTRICTIONS RELATING TO THE WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS AND THREE A STATEMENT THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS FOUND- FAT IN. OF THAT CRIME. REMOVING THESE ADDITIONAL CHALLENGES WILL HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS. SIDE WITH MORE THE BILL HELP LOWER RECIDIVISM LEVELS AND CREATE A PATH FOR THOSE WHO WERE FOUND INNOCENT TO RE ENTER INTO SOCIETY I'D LIKE INTRODUCED A JOHN HELD IN. IN THE FROM AFTER IN. SATISFIED OF THE BUILDING WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR I'VE OF. ARE YOU SEE WALDRON- HERE SHOW WILL GIVE YOU FOUR MINUTES OF YOUR THE SOUL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'M JOHN ALLEN FOUNDER OF AFTER IN A SENSE- CO SPONSOR OF THIS BILL ALONG WITH CALIFORNIA SAYS- WE ARE IN OAKLAND BASED NONPROFIT THAT PROVIDES. ASSISTANCE A- WE'RE BACK IN. AND IMPRISONED FOR CRIMES THEY DID NOT COMMIT WE'VE REACHED MORE THAN SEVENTY EXONERATION CALIFORNIA AND GROWING AND MORE THAN EIGHT HUNDRED NATIONALLY WITH SKILL HELP WITH INCREASING ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE SOCIAL SERVICES AND LEGAL SERVICES. WE WANT TO THANK CENTER GLAZER- FOR CHAMPIONING THIS CAUSE AND PREVIOUS CAUSES AND CURRENT CAUSES FOR EXONERATION CALIFORNIA AND KEEPING CALIFORNIA- AHEAD OF THE PACK OF OTHER STATES AND HOW WE- FACE UP TO THE CONSEQUENCES OF. WRONGFUL CONVICTION- IT DAILY CONVERSATIONS EXONERATES I HEAR ABOUT MANY OF THE BARRIERS THEY FACE IN REBUILDING THEIR LIVES AND- WHEN WE WORK WITH US ON OUR TIME WE SPEAK ABOUT POST RELEASE ASSISTANCE WE'RE TALKING MANY MANY. STAFF RELEASE WE JUST WITH THE TYPICAL REENTRY FOR WORK. I'M TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN OUT FOR TEN FIFTEEN YEARS AND THEY TOLD. ABOUT OF CURTIS THE DEEP. OF BEING SEEN AS TOLD WERE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED AND THIS BILL AGAIN WOULD FOCUS ONLY P. OR OR FROM VICTIMS COMP IS PART. AND IT WOULD PROVIDE THEM THE CERTIFICATE OF INNOCENCE THAT SUMMER GLAZER MENTIONED AND IT WOULD ALSO REQUIRE THAT THE RAPSHEETS BE ANNOTATED. TO SIMPLY REFLECT THE ULTIMATE DISPOSITION OF THE CASE THAT THEY WERE FOUND INNOCENT I CURRENTLY THAT DOES NOT HAPPEN AND SO IN ADDITION TO THE DEBT THE DIFFICULTY IN TELLING THEIR STORY- THAT WOULD BE IN SOME PART REMEDY BOX AND- ONE. SERVED IT AND BY THE WAY WALKING IN WITH AN ORDER FROM THE VICTIM'S COMPENSATION BORDER ACCORD OF MANY PAGES THIS IS NOT THE SAME- THIS WOULD REALLY BE- GREAT STEP FORWARD. BUT IN ADDITION TO THAT- THE RAPSHEETS AT THE DOJ LEVEL. I WILL BECAUSE THEY DRAW FROM THE STATE RAPSHEETS I WILL BE ANNOTATED TO- AS I MENTIONED BEFORE REFLECT WHAT ACTUALLY OCCURRED. SO AGAIN THANK YOU FOR. CONSIDERING THIS BILL AND I'M HERE TO ANSWER ANY. QUESTIONS THE COMMITTEE MAY HELP. OKAY ARE DO WE HAVE ADDITIONAL WITNESSES HERE IN A ROOM- WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT.

WE'RE GONNA BE DOING SB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT THANKS IN A WINNER THANK YOU ARE JIM BRADFORD- ONE THING YOU'RE GOING THIS- ARE TODAY I AM PRESENTING SENATE BILL TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ARE WHICH WILL PROTECT OUR TERMS AND THEIR PRIVACY BY PROHIBITING. D. A. PROFILES FROM BEING USED FOR ANY PURPOSE OTHER THAN IT BEING AN INVESTIGATION ACROSS THE CENTER OF THE ANSWER AND WHICH RESULTED. I CURRENTLY CAN IF THEY CHOOSE- SUBMIT A SEXUAL ASSAULT EXAMINATION- IN ORDER TO COLLECT AS EVIDENCE INCLUDING DNA EVIDENCE I MAY HELP IDENTIFY. THE PERPETRATOR THIS IS AN EX VERY EXTREMELY INVASIVE EXAMINATION- IF YOU IMAGINE A SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR I JUST HAVING UNDERGONE ONE OF THE MOST DRAMATIC EXPERIENCES AMASSED LOS ANGELES ALL. HAVE YOU THE KERR FORWARD. AND THEN GO COMING BY ACTUALLY GOING TO THE HOSPITAL AND UNDERGOING AN INTENSELY INVADE. OUR OUR NATION TO COLLECT DNA- IT'S NOT SURPRISING THAT MANY SURVIVORS DO NOT COME FORWARD BECAUSE OF THE BARRIERS INVOLVED AND MANY DO COME FORWARD I DO NOT A CEMEX. IMITATION BECAUSE FOR SOME PEOPLE IT CAN BE RE TRAUMATIZING- FEDERAL LAW WHEN A VICTIM PROVIDES DNA THE FEDERAL DATABASE- DOES NOT ALLOW FOR THE IDEA NAY IN THE FUTURE BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES DNA'S USED TO HELP IDENTIFY- THE ATTACK- IT WILL NOT BE USED FOR OTHER PURPOSES. UNFORTUNATELY WE EARLIER THIS- THAT- THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT HAD A LOCAL DATABASE CONTAINING DNA FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS- AND OTHER VICTIMS. AND WE'RE YOU IN FUTURE CRIMES SO IN OTHER WORDS SOMEONE SEXUALLY ASSAULTED GOES TO THE HOSPITAL TO PROVIDE A DNA SAM- AND IT GOES INTO A DATABASE HOLDING ON TO THAT DATABASE. AND THEN THAT DNA BE USED TO IMPLICATE THE SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVOR FOR A FUTURE ON RELATED OFFENSE AND IF YOU'RE- WHEN THAT HAPPENED WE ALL SAID WHAT I CAN'T POSSIBLY. BE LEGAL BECAUSE THE LAST THING WE WOULD WANT TO DO IS CONVEYED A SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS BUT IF YOU HAVE THE COURAGE TO COME FORWARD AND TO GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND PROVIDE A DNA SAMPLE- THE LAST THING WE WANT TO CONVEY TO THEM IS THAT DOING THAT MIGHT GET YOU IN. WELL IN THE FUTURE. YOUR FUTURE. PROBLEM WE TOOK LOOK AT STATE LAW WE REALIZED THAT IT WAS- ALTHOUGH I THINK THAT IT IS. LIKELY THAT A GOOD ARGUMENT THAT IT'S UNCONSTITUTIONAL AND TO THE RIGHT TO PRIVACY- THERE WAS NOTHING IN STATE CO. OP PROHIBITING IT. AND SO AS A RESULT WE INTRODUCE THIS BILL- WORKING WITH OUR DISTRICT ATTORNEY FROM WHO ARE YOU WILL HERE SHORTLY AND WITH ADVOCATES THE BILL PROVIDES IT'S QUITE SIMPLE. ON THE IF YOU A CAN PROVIDE. A SAMPLE ON BAG DNA CANNOT BE RETAINED AND THEN USED FOR PURPOSES UNRELATED TO IDENTIFYING- YOUR ATTACKER. OUR THIS IS. OUR LEGISLATURE THAT HONESTLY SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE CODE FOREVER- BUT WE DID NOT REALIZE THAT THIS WAS AN ISSUE NOW THAT WE DO. IT SAYS TESTIFYING IN PERSON IS SAN FRANCISCO DISTRICT ATTORNEY TO SUBMIT IN WHOSE OFFICE- DISCOVERED THIS PROBLEM AND MADE PUBLIC AND I WANT TO THANK FOR DOING THAT- AND THEN IN ADDITION- ELSE- CONNECTS- THE- POLICY AND ADVOCACY AT THE JOYFUL HEART. FOUNDATION THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU CHAIR BRADFORD AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR TIME AND ATTENTION TO THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE THANK YOU SENATOR WIENER FOR INVITING ME TODAY THANK YOU SIR WE AND ASSEMBLY. FOR SERVING AUTHOR AND CO AUTHOR OF THIS IMPORTANT BILL. I'M HONORED TO SPEAK COSPONSORED SB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT TO PROTECT AND SUPPORT. SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL. SB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT STEMS FROM MY OFFICES DISCOVERY THAT THE SAN FRANCISCO POLICE DEPARTMENT CRIME LAB WAS SYSTEMATICALLY RETAINING DNA COLLECTED FROM SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN ITS QUALITY ASSURANCE DATABASE AND LATER SEARCHING THE DATABASE- INCRIMINATE. I AM. SINCE CAN THAT INCLUDES COLLECTED FROM CHILD VICTIMS. THIS PRACTICE IS UNETHICAL AND VIOLATES SURVIVORS PRIVACY RIGHTS IT ALSO THREATENS PUBLIC SAFETY BY TREATING VICTIMS LIKE CRIMINALS IT DISSUADE SURVIVORS COMING FORWARD TO REPORT SEXUAL ASSAULTS WHICH ARE ALREADY SIGNIFICANTLY UNDER REPORTED THAT MAKES ALL OF US LESS SAFE. I EXPOSE THIS THIS AND CALLED FOR AT LEAST. SB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT DOES THAT IT WOULD PROHIBIT THE RETENTION OF DNA PROFILES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS IN ANY DATABASE THAT COULD BE SEARCHED FOR REASONS UNRELATED TO THE SPECIALIST. BUILDERS NOT LIMIT THE DNA TO INVESTIGATE SEXUAL ASSAULT CRIMES SB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT ALLOWS DNA EVIDENCE TO BE USED IN THE INVESTIGATION OF THE UNDERLYING SEXUAL ASSAULT CASE- NOT RESTRICT THE USE OF THE SUSPECTED PERPETRATORS DNA. SO LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENTS CAN STILL CONNECT DIFFERENT SEXUAL ASSAULT CASES. SB TWELVE TWENTY EIGHT WILL PROTECT THE PRIVACY AND CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS OF SURVIVORS AND WILL PROMOTE PUBLIC SAFETY BY ENCOURAGING SURVIVORS TO REPORT SEXUAL VIOLENCE. THE MISUSE OF SURVIVORS DNA UNDERMINES PUBLIC TRUST VIOLATES VICTIM PRIVACY AND THE TERMS OF SURVIVORS FROM COMING FORWARD MY OFFICE STAND WITH HER AND WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT TO PROTECT THE RIGHTS IN EVERY WAY WE CAN. BEST TWO DATE IS CRITICAL PUBLIC SAFETY AND THE SUPPORTING ACTUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS. FOR THESE REASONS.

PROFITS WHO WERE PREPARING FOR THE NEXT INSTRUCTION AND THEY'RE RAISING MONEY FROM OUR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- OR THEY THEY CAN RAISE MONEY FOR CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS- TWO SEPARATE- THAT WOULD BE TAX DEDUCTIBLE AND I DON'T THINK THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO THAT. SO WERE YOU REFERENCE JUST FOR CLARIFICATION PURPOSES WERE YOU REFERENCING- ARE YOU CONCERNED THAT THERE'S A PROBLEM IN CALIFORNIA WITH THE NONPROFIT OR ARE YOU REFERRING MORE TO NATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS NONPROFIT NONPROFITS THAT WOULD BE IMPACTED BY THIS BILL ONE AS- NONPROFIT CENTER INCORPORATED REGISTERED AS NONPROFITS IN CALIFORNIA AND RECEIVE THEIR TAX EXEMPTION FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD.

AND HE HAS SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY TWO. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN. TODAY I AM PRESENTING TO YOU ALL SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY TWO. OTHERWISE KNOWN AS RYAN'S LAW. WE'LL TELL RYAN'S STORY- IN A MINUTE HIS MOM IS HERE TO DO THAT PART BUT- I JUST WANT TO START OUT THE PRESENTATION JUST BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE. THIS MEASURE. UP CRAFTED- AND MAKE US A STRONGER BILL- THAT DOESN'T CREATE A NEW CRIME BUT REALLY INFORMS. THE DEFINITION OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND SO TO THAT EFFECT I WANT TO NOTE THAT WILL BE ACCEPTED MEN THE TYPICALLY REMOVE THE REFERENCE TO PERSONS GOING DOUBLE THE SPEED LIMIT UNDER THE QUICK DEFINITION OF NEGLIGENCE. JUST SEE ON PAGE SEVEN UNDER SECTION THREE AND- STRIKING SECTIONS THAT REQUIRE THESE COURT MANDATED AT. THINGS THAT WERE CURRENT. BUT THIS THIS IS INTENDED TO MAKE OUR STREETS SAFER FOR PEDESTRIANS FOR BICYCLISTS FOR DRIVERS- WE'RE LOSING LIVES AT AN ALARMING RATE- BY. IT JULES WHO ARE OFTEN A REPEAT OFFENDERS OF EXTREME SPEEDING- AND OTHER INCIDENTS THE BILL- WILL NOT BRING BACK THE LIFE OF ANY OF THESE VICTIMS LOS TO FACING DREAM SPEAKING TO- IMPACTS WE'VE SEEN FROM INSIDE SHOWS HAPPENING IN IN THE COMMUNITY- COPING- OR CAROLINE RYAN- THEY'RE NOT WITH US BUT I THINK AS A LEGISLATURE WE CAN ACT AND IN A SURGERY- AND INTEL WAY USE. SCOPE TO PROSECUTE CRIMES WITHIN ATTENTION TOWARDS WHAT IS TRULY GROSSLY NEGLIGENT- THE FACTORS MAY INCLUDE NOW UNDER THIS BILL PARTICIPATION INSIDE SHOWS OR ACCEPT AN EXHIBITIONIST EXCESSIVE SPEED. BUT NOT THIS NOTION OF A DOUBLE THE LEGAL LIMIT ON COUNTY HIGHWAYS STREETS- BUT THE DMV DOES REPORT THAT OVER FIFTEEN HUNDRED MORE RECKLESS DRIVING CITATIONS STATEWIDE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE WE'RE- THAN THE YEAR BEFORE. AN L. A. ALONE WE'VE SEEN TWO HUNDRED NINETY FOUR AND IF IT WAS KILLED WITHIN THAT 24% INCREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. I LAST. 5% AND SERIOUS INJURIES TO BICYCLISTS WERE UP BY 34% FROM TWENTY TWENTY. C. H. P. REPORTS THE STREET RACING SIDESHOWS OF CROSSOVERS TWO HUNDRED SIXTY FOUR CRASHES STATEWIDE THE PAST FIVE YEARS THIRTY OF WHICH HAVE BEEN FATAL. TWENTY FOUR OF TO RESULT IN SERIES IN. THIS ON TOP OF THE TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND CALLS THAT THEY RECEIVE FROM ILLEGAL STREET RACING- AND EXCESSIVE SPEEDING. IN GENERAL HAS BECOME AN EPIDEMIC ON OUR ROADS THE FACT IS MEMBERS THAT PEOPLE USE CARS. AS THEY WERE GOING. OR IS THERE SOME VEHICLE FOR THEIR SOCIAL MEDIA PROWESS. AT THEY ARE REALIZING THE FATAL AFFECT THAT. IS KIND OF NEGLIGENCE HAS ON FAMILIES. I'M A STICK TO THE CALIFORNIA VEHICLE CODE AND THE PENAL CODE ISSUES BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE AND LET MY LEAD WITNESS- TALK ABOUT THE PERSONAL SIDE OF THIS BUT- ESSENTIALLY THIS GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD. SERIES OF MAY FACTORS OF THESE ARE THESE ARE MANDATORY FACTORS BUT IT MAY INCLUDE FOR PROSECUTION PURPOSES SOME OF THESE FACTORS BUT THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE DEFINITION IN LAW STILL HOLES- YOU STILL HAVE TO- EXHIBIT. THIS IN A CONSCIOUS DISREGARD FOR LIFE- AND IF YOU CHAU FACTS SHOWING MALICE- YOU CAN BE GUILTY OF MURDER UNDER EXISTING LAW. THIS IS SOBRE EVER WORK- AND I APPRECIATE THAT THE COMMITTEE IS NOT LOOKING TO INCREASE RATES OF CARBURETION- BUT I THINK THIS BILL WILL SEE TO IT THAT THOSE OUT THERE PARTICIPATING THIS RECKLESS ACTIVITY REALIZE THAT IT'S NOT A GAME. AND FOR THE VERY TIGHTLY ORGANIZED NETWORKS OF STREET RACERS AND EXTREME SPEEDERS- GERMAN DRIVING A LAMBORGHINI WHO JUST KILLED SOMEONE AND CENTER COM LOGGERS DISTRICT THE OTHER WEEK- DRIVING HIS DAD'S LAMBORGHINI IN FACING VERY LITTLE CONSEQUENCE FOR THAT ACT BECAUSE IT WASN'T EVEN IN HIS NAME UNDER THE TITLE. STAND SO HOPE BUT JUSTICE HERE TODAY AND RESPECTFULLY ASK RIVAL AND I'M HONORED HERE TO HAVE THE KOTEL FAMILY WITH ME- AND I THINK KAREN IS HERE TO DELIVER THE LEAD TESTIMONY. ONE OR TWO WITNESSES SUGGEST JUST ONE ART WILL FORTY FOUR MINUTES.

THANK FOR DRY OVER NINETY AN HOUR JUST EIGHT MONTHS BEFORE THE ACCIDENT DUE TO CURRENT LAW THE DRIVER WAS CHARGED WITH A MISDEMEANOR KILLER MANSLAUGHTER AND RECEIVED ONE YEAR PROBATION SIX MONTHS.

GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR BRADFORD AND TO THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION MY HEART GOES OUT TO RYAN'S FAMILY AND ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT HAVE SUFFERED THIS KIND OF TRAGEDY. HOWEVER WHILE SEEKING TO STOP TRAFFIC DEATHS IS A LAUDABLE GOAL SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY TWO WAS FLOOD AND THEREFORE NOT THE ANSWER TO OUR PROBLEM WITH RECKLESS AND DANGEROUS DRIVING OR VEHICULAR MANSLAUGHTER. SB. FORTY SEVEN TWO WOULD CONSTRUCTIVELY REMOVE THE CURRENT FELONY REQUIREMENT OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND ADD THE INCLUSION OF ANY SITUATION WHERE THE DRIVER HAS PRIVATE PRIOR CONVICTIONS OF SPEEDING OR RECKLESS DRIVING. IF THE CURRENT OFFENSE INVOLVED SPEEDING OR RECKLESS DRIVING. GROSS NEGLIGENCE BY NH. THE TIME OF THE ACCIDENT THAT LED TO THE DEATH THERE CANNOT BE A PER SE INDICATION OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE A SIDE SHOW OR AN EXHIBITION OF SPEED MAY BE INDICATIVE OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE BUT NOT NECESSARILY UNDER ALL CIRCUMSTANCES USING PRIOR CONVICTIONS OF RECKLESS DRIVING IS AS BY THE BILL SAID NOTHING ABOUT THE DROPPING AT THE TIME. FOR DOES. THE ROAST. OR- MEN'S RAHA SUCH AS IMPLIED MALICE THE PROPOSED ADMONITION IS- IS OVERBROAD AND SERVES NO BASIS EXCEPT TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR PROSECUTORS TO CHARGE AND CONVICT INDIVIDUALS UNDER THE ALREADY FLOOD SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY TWO IN MY EXPERIENCE AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER FOR NEARLY FORTY YEARS AND DOESN'T A DEFENSE ATTORNEY LATER THEIR THE LOCATOR OF AN INDIGENT DEFENSE TEAM I CAN TELL YOU THE HONEST MY ALREADY GIVEN IN FOR INSTANCE DO YOU AYE CASES DO WELL. YOU REALLY DO ANYTHING I THAN IS THE PROSECUTORS BURDEN WHY DO I SAY THIS OUR CLIENTS CAN BARELY TAKE IN ALL THE INFORMATION THAT SAVE WHERE INFRACTIONS ARE HEARD AND JUDGES OVERSEE HUNDREDS OF INFRACTIONS IN THE DAY THESE COURTS MOVE AT LIGHTNING SPEED AN ADMONISHMENT REGARDING FUTURE BEHAVIOR IS VIRTUALLY THE LAST THING A DEFENDANT TAKES INTO MIND. IN THESE SITUATIONS PEOPLE WHO CAUSE THE DEATH WILL DRIVING BASED ON CONDUCT NOT AMOUNTING TO A FEW. AND WITHOUT ROSE NEGLIGENCE NOT LONG IN OUR OVERFLOWING PRISONS AND JAILS MISDEMEANOR SERRATION CAN PROVIDE ADEQUATE PUNISHMENT AND DETERRENCE CHANGING THE RULES OF THE LAW THAT IS STOOD WELL IN THE INTEREST OF JUSTICE FOR DECADES. SIMPLY NOT JUSTIFIED HERE THESE RESULTS WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MARK COUNTY CAN TO THE ISSUE THAT ARE WAS JUST REYES AND- DOES OUR AMENDMENT TO DRESS UP. A THERE WERE AMENDMENT YEP I HAD NON SMOKING THEM COUNCIL. HE YES SO THERE THE ADMONISHMENTS SECTIONS ARE OUT OKAY I UPON AND THEN AND HE'S TAKING OUT THE AT THE END OF THE GROUP TECHNICIANS DEFINITION ITHER BEING CONVICTED OF A SPEEDING ACCESS TO DOUBLE. I STILL FEEL THAT YOU WE CAN'T HAVE A PER SE DEFINITION OF GROSS NEGLIGENCE IT IS THE TOTALITY OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES SO OUR POSITION WOULD REMAIN ALTHOUGH WE DO APPRECIATE REMOVAL OF THE ADMIN OPPOSITION HERE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE. NOT LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES MODERATOR USER ANYONE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF. SB ONE TWELVE. FROM THIS IS KATHY SURE FROM THE ACLU I THOUGHT THAT I WAS- AND UP TO BE A LEAD OPPOSITION WHAT ON. THEY SHOULD HAVE A NAMELESS ESERVER READY YET CORRECT.

OKAY NO ONE SHOULD SHOULD HAVE SUCH A LAW- I THINK WE ALL WANT TO STOP TRAFFIC TRAFFIC FATALITIES BUT UNFORTUNATELY THE APPROACH TAKEN IN THE STILL WON'T DO THAT- PEOPLE WHO. CAN RECKLESS DRIVING OR THANK ABOUT BEING ABOUT. WHETHER IF IT IF THEY DOES CIRCUMSTANCE THEY'RE NOT CONTEMPLATING SOMEONE DYING AS A RESULT OF THEIR RECKLESS DRIVING WHETHER THEY BE PUNISHED ON THEM. FELONY LEVEL. STING ONE MAKES NO DISTINCTION AS TO HOW A PERSON SHOULD BE PUNISHED ON. WHAT. IN THE CAR. AT. AT THE BUT- IF NOT- REGARDLESS OF WHAT THEIR PAST RECORD MAY HAVE BEEN- AND THEY WERE NOT DRIVING IT CHRIS NEGLIGENT IN THE CURRENT CASE AND- THEY STATE PARKWAY. I YEAH YOU OTHERWISE AS THE DON'T- WE RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR LOCAL. THANK YOU ANYONE HERE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. ANY ADDITIONAL STRAIN ON WILL GO TO OUR PHONE LINES IN OUR CONTINUE WITH. OPPOSITION FROM PARENTS. MODERATOR THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY TWO PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT WE'LL BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEES DURING QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS SENATOR WINNER I THANK YOU FOR SAW- I WANT TO. EXPRESS I'M- SUDDENNESS SECOND ALSO IS FOR YOUR LOSS- APPARENTLY AS A CHILD. PART OF PARADISE AND NEVER COMES BACK AND IT'S JUST I CAN'T EVEN FATHOM. WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I'M REPRESENTATIVE OF THE U. TURN THE HORRIFIC TRAGEDY AND TO. ADVOCACY TO TRY- AVOID DISASTERS LIKE THIS- IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU. AND I WANT TO THANK HER FOR THE COMMITTEE AND- TO REALLY. TRY TO GET IT. TRY TO GO WHICH I THINK REVISED. ABSOLUTELY WITHOUT PAYING THE CONSEQUENCES AND SO HAPPY TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND I'LL MAKE A MOTION TO ANSWER BY COMMITTEE. SENATOR CALM WATER YES I APOLOGIZE FOR HAVING TO STEP OUT FOR A SECOND I JUST WANTED- TO KNOW BECAUSE MY UNDERSTANDING IS WITH- THE KILLER MANSLAUGHTER. YOU COULD GET SENTENCED- YOU KNOW AS YOU COULD BE ONE YEAR IN COUNTY JAIL COULD BE SIX YEARS IN STATE PRISON SO I WAS JUST TRYING. TO GET A SENSE OF. IN AND WHAT TO DO THAT IS NOT AVAILABLE. USING CURRENT CODE. AND YES. YES AND I WOULD ALSO I WOULD AYE WE NEED WE DO HAVE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE HERE FROM ALISON TREES WILL TO IT WHAT'S TO COMMENT ON THAT NUMBER AB WHAT MAKING HER WAY TO THE MY LOAN- G. HELLO. BRIAN'S CASE I FEEL. FROM FROM MY STANDPOINT FROM THE R. AND IS TO ADD FACTORS THAT CAN BE CONSIDERED BUT NOT TO TIE A PROSECUTOR'S HANDS TO BE FORCED INTO THAT SO THAT THE LANGUAGE IN THE BILL MAY. INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO HE SORT OF. PARTICIPATION IS SIDESHOW DRIVING OVER A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR- YOU KNOW THESE RECKLESS DRIVING INCIDENTS SO IN OTHER WORDS- THE GROSS NEGLIGENCE STANDARD YOUR SETTING HASN'T CHANGED AND IT DOESN'T ACTUALLY CHANGE LENGTH OF SENTENCE. DOES AND- YOUR SHOW. ALICE CAN YOU KNOW DO YOU HAVE OF MURDER- AND SO IN ANY CIRCUMSTANCES THE IDEAS THAT BY FILLING OUT SOME OF THESE FACTORS FOR THE PROSECUTION TO AT LEAST BE ABLE TO TURN TO. IN THAT HELP TO MAKE THE CASE BETTER IF THE TOTALITY OF CIRCUMSTANCES STILL- MOUNT TO WHAT WHAT WOULD AMOUNT TO VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER BUT- IT'S NOT TYING THEIR TO THAT. THAT'S THAT'S HOW WE DON'T WANT TO BE HEAVY HANDED AND I DON'T KNOW THAT THAT WOULD BE PER A GROUP AND SEE IF. AFTER THE TEST GROSS NEGLIGENCE IS MINOR. THANK YOU MY NAME IS ALLISON TREES ALL AND SENATORS FURNACE RIGHT AND USUALLY CRIMINAL DEFENSE ATTORNEY- I'VE DONE SO FOR THE LAST TWENTY FIVE THEY'VE ALSO VICTIM ADVOCACY. THIS IS A UNIQUE CONFIRM. HELLO FAMILY FOR MANY YEARS AND THE SUN THAT THEY LOST WAS A VERY. DEAR FRIEND OF MY SON'S. SOMETHING HAS TO BE DONE HERE AS A DEFENSE ATTORNEY I WATCHED ON. THE WAYS IN WHICH THE VAGUENESS OF THIS LAW. BENEFITS DEFENDANTS ALL THE TIME AS THE PROSECUTORS STRUGGLED DISABLED HOW DID HOW DID THESE FAX FIFTY GREATER PUNISHMENT HOW DO WE DO SOMETHING THE PERSON IN THIS CASE WAS GIVEN ONE YEAR OF PROBATION. AND IN THAT ONE YEAR OF PROBATION THERE ISN'T EVEN ENOUGH TIME. TO PAY BACK THE EXPENSES THAT THEY HAD FOR THEIR SON'S FUNERAL. PROSECUTORS NEED GUIDANCE AND IF YOU DIRECT THEM TO THINGS LIKE DRIVING OVER A HUNDRED MILES AN HOUR RECKLESS DRIVING. THOSE THINGS ASSIST THE SYSTEM. IN REALLY TARGETING THESE THESE ARE JUST MINOR VIOLATORS THESE ARE PEOPLE ESPECIALLY IN THEIR CASE THIS IS A CASE WHERE NINE MONTHS BEFORE THIS AND WAS DROPPED ON NINETY UP SURFACED. SURFACE STREET MIDDLE OF THE DAY. SO I UNDERSTAND WHY THE. WHERE THERE IS AN OBVIOUS SPEED LIMIT THAT'S AGAINST THE LAW. IT IS IT IS BUT FOR SENATE AND- BUT I DO THINK IF YOU CAN DIRECT. A PROSECUTOR'S ATTENTION OR A JUDGE'S ATTENTION TO CERTAIN WORDS IN ACCORD BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST TOO BIG. AND IT WILL HELP THE ENTIRE SYSTEM PROSECUTE THOSE WHO REALLY NEED TO BE MORE SERIOUSLY PROSECUTED THEN JUST A YEAR OF PROBATION ESTIMATE THERE NO DETAILED I'M SOME COMMUNITY SERVICE. I YOUR- SO I'M GONNA STOP TALKING I'M A YEAH BECAUSE I DO I HEAR WHAT YOU'RE SAYING AND I'M TRYING TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE AND WHAT LAW BECAUSE LAWS NOT ABOUT WHAT HAPPENED IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE IT'S ABOUT ON A GO BOARD AND HOW YOU'RE IMPACTING A SYSTEM AND SO THE QUESTION WAS. IT SEEMS TO ME. THERE ARE ALREADY TOOLS IN THE PENAL CODE TOOL KIT TO ALLOW FOR. AT INSTANCES WHERE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF CIRCUMSTANCES- THAT. PROBABLY CONTRIBUTED TO SOMEONE'S DEATH- THAT THERE ARE TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT THAT CAN BE USED AND I DON'T KNOW ALL THE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT HAPPENED WITH THIS PARTICULAR CASE I CAN'T. WHY THE PERSON DO WE GET PATIENTS BERMAN HERE. I'M EITHER NO WAY YOU CAN. I IN A PLAN CLEAN TIME AND THE DEATH OF SOMEONE WHO WILL NEVER COME BACK I MEAN WE EVEN WE EVEN WANT TO DO THAT A LOT IT RIGHT- SO I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. OFTENTIMES WHEN THEY'RE BILLS IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO FIX SOMETHING THAT ISN'T WORKING FOR. YOU KNOW THE COMMON DENOMINATOR FOR THE GREATER GOOD AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS IF YOU ARE INVOLVED IN SOMETHING WHERE YOU'RE DRIVING OVER THE SPEED LIMIT. IF YOU. KILL SOMEONE. IF YOU HAVE A REGISTRATION THAT IS EXPIRED IF IT'S IN A CAR THAT ISN'T YOUR LIKE ALL OF THOSE THINGS YOU WOULD ADD INTO THE CHARGES THAT ARE PLACED ON A PARTICULAR DEFENDANT TO MAKE THE CASE. AM I HEY THIS IS JAZZ FINDING THE TOOLS IN THAT TO GET. AND MAKING IT MORE CLEAR TO THOSE WHO ACTUALLY DO THIS ON A DAILY BASIS. THAT YES YOU CAN CHARGE FIFTY MANSLAUGHTER. IN THESE SPECIFIC CASES BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT TODAY AND I DO THIS EVERY DAY IN COURT EVERY DAY AND I SEE THAT IT IS NOT BEING CHARGED NEARLY IT. HALF IN KEY IS WHERE. I THINK THIS LIMITED EDITION TO ONE NINETY TWO WILL MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE. THANK YOU ANY FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DEBATE ON THIS ISSUE. NOW ALL RIGHT I TOO WAS STRUGGLING WITH THIS AS I STATED- WITH AGAIN THE DUPLICITY INCIDENT WAYS OF- WHAT'S ALREADY ON THE BOOKS AND TRYING TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT WE'RE CAPTURING HEREIN ARE. WE ARE. FROM BOTH THE FAMILY AND- THE TO THE ATTORNEY HERE BUT MISSION. I TO SEE IF YOU CAN ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS IN YOUR CLOTHES MISTER. BUT IF YOU MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE ENGAGEMENT I THINK YOU YOU'RE ASKING THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AS A COMMITTEE AS AS MEMBERS- ADDED TODAY. M. INTENT ON WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION HERE ESPECIALLY IN LIGHT OF THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THE MOBILE OF THE ATTESTATION AND THIS QUESTION OF ARE WE GOING TO MAKE. THIS PER SE GROSS NEGLIGENCE QUESTION RIGHT. WE STILL WANT TO AFFORD PROSECUTORIAL DISCRETION IN THESE CASES YOU STILL NEED TO CONSIDER THE TOTALITY CIRCUMSTANCE WE DON'T WANT TO CUT EXISTING THAT WERE. WE JUST ADDING THESE MAY CONSIDERS. TO THE CODE WILL FOCUS AND ACQUIRE SOME KIND OF SURGICAL NATURE TO THIS PROSECUTION SO THAT WHEN FOLKS TO COME IN AND HE'S AGREE JUST CASES- THAT THEY'LL HAVE SOMETHING TO LOOK TO IN THE CODE. AND THAT. THEY CANCER PLAY THE DATE AIMS- THAT GETS. THE WELL HEELED PEOPLE WHO CAN AFFORD A VERY EXPENSIVE CRIMINAL DEFENSE LAWYER LIKE MYSTERY SO- TO GET THEM OFF WHAT. AND THE FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT KIND OF DEFENSE IF YOU'RERELYING SOLELY ON PUBLIC DEFENSE- AND THE CASE IS MOVING QUICKLY. THINGS GO VERY FAST- AND SO I THINK THERE'S AN INEQUITY IN CURRENT LAW. THAT AFFORDS- THE PRIVILEGED A LOT MORE ABILITY YOU KNOW THE KID DRIVING THE DAD'S LAMBORGHINI WITHOUT ANY SENSE OF CONSEQUENCE. I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THESE CARS ARE DEADLY AND SIDE SHOWS OR NOT A GAME STREAM SPEEDING IS NOT A GAME. THIS ISN'T A WAY TO IMPRESS YOUR FRIENDS THIS TAKES LIVES SO HOPING WITH THESE. THESE THESE LIGHT COMES ON THE SCALE A LITTLE MORE ATTENTION FOR PROSECUTORS WITHOUT LIMITING THAT DISCRETION AND WITHOUT BURDENING ANY. STATION THE EXISTING CODE THAT WE CAN. SIX MONTHS SO I APPRECIATE MISTER CHAIR YOUR WORK AND ESPECIALLY THE COMMITTEES WORKING HELPING MAKE THIS BILL- AT THIS BILL JUST. AND WITH THAT ESPECIALLY AFTER I VOTE. IN ORDER WIENER WE HAVE A FEW PASS RECOMMENDATION TO APPROPRIATIONS ABS AMENDED. AND I WOULD JUST ASK FOR THE AUTHORS COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE TO WORK TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED BY BOTH THE COMMITTEE AND THE OPPOSITION- THIS MEASURES TO MOVE FORWARD CHAU. THANK ALSO AT LEAST CALL THE ROLL ON. S. B. FOURTEEN SEVENTY TWO. SB FOURTEEN SEVENTY TWO BRADFORD BRADFORD I'D SHOW BOTH TRUBACI CAMARGO- KAMLAGER NOT VOTING SKINNER WIENER WIENER EIN. REDRESS THREE VOTES WILL LIBERAL OPENED FOR ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU FIGURE MUCH. YOURS OR SHE COULD DO SENATOR WILL EXPEL. THE PRESENTATION ANALYST AT. SACRAMENTO. MAKE IT. RIGHT I. GOOD AFTERNOON MR CHAIRMAN FIRST I WRITE TODAY TO PRESENT SB TEN EIGHTY NINE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR WILK BEFORE I PRESENT THIS BILL I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIR AND STAFF FOR THEIR HARD WORK THIS LEGISLATION THIS IS TRUE FOR A BILL THAT WILL ENSURE THE CALIFORNIA'S MEDICAL BENEFITS CHERRIES ARE ABLE TO RECEIVE THE HIGHEST QUALITY EYEGLASSES AVAILABLE. CURRENT LAW REQUIRES THE ADDRESS AND OTHER PROVIDERS TO OBTAIN I GO OUT. FROM THE CALIFORNIA PRISON INDUSTRY AUTHORITY. UNFORTUNATELY THE SYSTEM IS PLAGUED WITH PROBLEMS AS THE EYEGLASSES OFTEN TAKE MONTHS TO DELIVER TO PATIENTS AND ARE OF SUCH POOR QUALITY THAT THEY CAUSE IRRITATION AND BREAK MUCH MORE EASILY THAN AYE GLASSES MANUFACTURED ELSEWHERE. THIS BILL ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE BY ALLOWING PROVIDERS TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE PA TO OBTAIN EYEGLASSES FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES. THE LEGISLATURE UNANIMOUSLY PASSED THE LEGISLATION LAST YEAR WITH AB FIVE SEVENTY NINE LARA THAT ALLOWED CAL FIRE TO GO OUTSIDE OF THE P. EIGHTY. PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT FOR QUALITY PURPOSES. WITH ME TODAY TO PROVIDE EXPERT TESTIMONY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA TOM OF. OPTOMETRIC. THE DOCTOR. ASSOCIATION IS TERRY MAKE IT BACK OUT. MISTER CHAIRMAN TERRY MCKAY OVER THERE AND READ AN ASSOCIATES IN BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA OPTOMETRIC ASSOCIATION- THIS LEGISLATION DID PASSED UNANIMOUSLY FROM THE HEALTH COMMITTEE TWO WEEKS AGO. MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBER VINCE MIXED ORDINARY VICTORIES WITHIN THE PRISON SYSTEM LATELY PERHAPS MOST EXTRAORDINARY. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND PRISONERS REMOVED FROM THE STATE INCARCERATIONS SYSTEM NEVER SLOWING DOWN AND STOPPING THESE YEARS OF MASS INCARCERATION. THERE ARE HOWEVER SOME CONSEQUENCES WE KNOW FROM THE FIREFIGHTERS THAT THREE YEARS AGO WE HAD A HUNDRED NINETY EIGHT INMATE CRUZ LAST YEAR WE HAD FORTY TWO. WE KNOW THAT WE'RE LOSING THOSE PRISONERS THAT WE WOULD BE USING- FOR THE- FOR THE CAMPS AND WE ALSO LOSING THOSE WHO WE'D BE USING- FOR- THE TRAINING ARE THE PROBLEMS THAT REACH OPTOMETRY. W DID A SURVEY OF OUR MEMBERS WE FOUND OUT THAT FROM THE PRISON AUTHORITY 38% SAY IT TAKES AT LEAST ONE TO TWO MONTHS. 50% SAID IT TAKES AT LEAST TWO MONTHS. AND I REMIND YOU THAT THE PEOPLE WHO RECEIVE THESE GLASSES ARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE. 50% OF THE CHILDREN WHO LIVE IN CALIFORNIA UNDER MEDICARE I'LL- THERE THE ONES WHO GET THE GLASSES SO MUCH LATER THAN KIDS WHO ARE NOT. THE GLASSES THEMSELVES ARE NOT IN THE CONDITION THAT THEY SHOULD BE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED ALSO THAT WHAT WE'RE ASKING TO DO IS WHAT. IN MANY RESPECTS THE PIAA IS ALREADY DOING LKS. THE CLOSER WE LOOKED INTO THIS WE FOUND OUT THAT OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS THE PIAA. HAS CONTRACTED OUT THE WORK GIVEN TO THEM. LAST YEAR OVER FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND CASES OF GOING OUT AND HAVING EYE GLASSES DONE. LEADING OF COURSE ALSO TO THE LACK OF SUPERVISION. AND TO THE ALACRITY TO WHICH THEY ARE RETURNED. WE ARE NOT GOING AFTER THE PIAA PERSONALLY THOSE WHO HAVE A GOOD RELATIONSHIP WITH THE PIAA CAN CONTINUE TO USE THEM. I WOULD SUGGEST IS THE PRISONERS ARE ABSENT IN OUR PRISONS THAT THERE IS MORE SPACE FOR INDIVIDUALS TO BE A PART OF THE PIAA. THERE ARE SEVEN THOUSAND PRISONERS INVOLVED IN THIS PROGRAM. THEY WORK FOR IN FOURTEEN HUNDRED DIFFERENT AREAS OF PROVIDING GOODS AND SERVICES AND FOR THE MOST PART THEY DO AN EXTRAORDINARILY GOOD JOB. 68% OF WHAT THEY SELL ABOVE FROM 64% TWO YEARS AGO IS PURCHASED BY CDC ARE. SO WE CAN ALLOW THE OPTOMETRIST TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE GET THE GLASSES THAT THEY NEED WITHOUT DOING DAMAGE TO THE SYSTEM ITSELF. WE'RE ASKING FOR AN AYE VOTE. SORRY CAN YOU WERE HEARING- NOW LET'S MOVE TO WITNESSES HERE. WHO ARE PRESENT WISHING TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF S. B. TEN EIGHTY NINE. ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES WISHING TO SPEAK AND SUPPORT.

CORRECTIONS WHO GO TO A MEDIC CAL PROVIDER FOR OPTOMETRIC SERVICES THOSE PEOPLE SEND THE GLASSES TO PI A TO GET THE PRESCRIPTION FILLED. AND SO P. I. A. FILLS THE PRESCRIPTIONS FOR MEDICAL PEOPLE NOT IN KERR STREET MEDICAL OKAY BECAUSE THE WITNESS CONFUSE ME IT'S FOR ADULTS TO. NOW IT APPLY IT ISN'T THERE WAS ARE ALL MEDICAID IT'S MADAM. SENATORS FOR ALL MEDICARE OKAY. OKAY THAT HELPS. THIS WAS. IT SHOULD BE SIMPLE BUT IT'S NOT BUT- SO IT'S REALLY REALLY GOOD THAT WE HAVE RESTORED. THE OPTOMETRIC SERVICES A MEDIC CAL THAT'S ESSENTIAL AND NOW THAT WE HAVE THEN EVERYONE WHO IS ON MEDICAL THE NEW NEEDS GLASSES NEEDS DESERVES QUALITY GLASSES AND IF OUR P. I. E. SYSTEM IS NOT PRODUCING THAT WE HAVE TO FIX IT. AND WE HAVE. WHAT I DON'T LIKE ABOUT THE BILL IS PULLING IS PROVIDING CONTRACTS TO- YOU KNOW. PRIVATE SECTOR COMPANIES WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO PROVIDE A SERVICE THAT WAS A JOB TRAINING PROGRAM FOR. HOWEVER I HAVE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE PA RUNS. AND I DON'T THINK WE COMPENSATE OUR INCARCERATED INDIVIDUALS ADEQUATELY AND I DON'T KNOW HOW MANY OR WHO MIGHT HAVE BEEN IN THIS PROGRAM EVER GOT A JOB WITH ANY TYPE OF UP TO CURRENT COMPANY- NOW I'M TAKING IT SOMEWHAT FACE VALUE. THAT THE QUALITY IS LOW AND PERHAPS IT IS NOT. AND I DON'T I DON'T KNOW IF- I CAN'T REMEMBER WHEN I READ THE ANALYSIS IF THERE WAS ANY- DOCUMENTING TO WHETHER TO BALLOT THE QUALITY OF THE GLASS IS BEING PRODUCED BY IN THE PA SYSTEM OR IS LOW. WE ARE TO KNOW THAT OKAY SO- SO THEY'RE KIND OF SEPARATE ISSUES. AND- I'M PERSONALLY WHERE THERE'S OTHER PROBLEMS WHETHER THIS QUALITY ISSUES THEY ARE NOT BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH THE SYSTEM AND I CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE. THE SB A SITUATION WERE USING OUR MEDIC CAL DOLLARS TO PROVIDE. YOU KNOW LOWER QUALITY PRODUCTS SO IT'S I'M IN A CONUNDRUM ON. THE COMPETITION IS GOOD AND I CERTAINLY SEE THE PIAA AS A MONOPOLY OF SORTS AND I HAVE HEARD NOT ABOUT. I WHERE BUT FOR THINGS LIKE YOU KNOW WOMEN'S UNDERWEAR AND BRAS THE QUALITY IS REALLY POOR- YOU CAN WEAR THEM ONE OR TWO TIMES AND THEN THERE'S NO A LASTING AGAIN IT IT TAKES A LONG TIME IF YOU ASK FOR ANOTHER PAIR. I'M FOR IT TO COME- THAT'S RIGHT FOLKS- IT'S CLEAR THAT ARE INCARCERATED AND I GET THAT THIS IS NOT. SO I MEAN AND YOU KNOW THERE MAY ALSO BE AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO AN AUDIT ON PA BECAUSE I CERTAINLY THINK THAT IF YOU HAVE A- CLIENTELE. THAT ISN'T VALUED THEN YOU MAY FEEL INCLINED TO PRODUCE PRODUCTS OF LESSER QUALITY. AND MAYBE I HAVE A BIAS FOR EYEWEAR BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE- SO THEN THERE'S THAT TOO. THE OTHER COME TO QUESTIONS. WELL I'D Q. I'M TORN BETWEEN THIS BECAUSE- I GET WE'RE TRYING TO GO AND IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE HAVE QUALITY PRODUCTS THAT ARE MADE I TOO WAS LONG CENTER SKINNER WANNA KNOW HOW MANY JOBS. ARE YOU KNOW AFTER BEING RELEASED ARMY INDIVIDUALS FOUND JOBS IN. AN OP TO METRICS- BUT I GUESS I'M MOSTLY TROUBLED BY THE FACT THAT. YOU GUYS- MAKE GLASSES WERE OF POOR WHITE KIDS IT'S ONLY FOR BLACK AND BROWN KIDS TO GET GLASSES. RIPPED THROUGH ME FOR A LOOP BECAUSE THE LAST TIME I CHECKED NOT ALL BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE POOR. AND ON ALL POOR PEOPLE BLACK AND BROWN CHAU- ARE YOU DISCRIMINATING AGAINST POOR WHITE FOLKS AND THE ONLY PRISON GLASSES. HE STILL ON. SO THAT'S KINDA BUT TO ME FOR A LOOP COLUSA. IN THE AREA HOPE SELL ANNA BECAUSE AGAIN ARE YOU DISCRIMINATING AS TO THE FACT THAT ONLY BLACK AND BROWN KIDS GET THEIR GLASSES MADE BY THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL. YOU KNOW. SYSTEM AYE AYE AYE I FOUND THAT VERY STRANGE SO ANYWAY. I'M NOT LEAVE MY COMMENTS THERE. WHEN CENTER SKINNER- I WANT TO JUST MAKE SURE AGAIN I'M READING THIS RIGHT INDEPENDENT OF BY OTHER CAR COMMENTS THIS DOES NOT ELIMINATE. D. I. A. FROM SUPPLYING GLASSES IT JUST ALLOWS FOR A NEW OKAY. WITH THAT I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT THE BILL. AND BUT I DO THINK THAT WE- SHOULD AT SOME POINT AND I'M NOT GONNA TELL HIM HEALTH BEING THE BUDGET HERE BUT WE REALLY NEED TO HAVE A HEARING ON THE P. I. IT. AND ON THE MOUNTAIN. YOU KNOW OUR PEOPLE REALLY BEING WELL TRAINED ARE THEY BEING PAID ADEQUATELY ARE THE PRODUCTS WORTH IT AND- POINT I WOULD HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE IN THAT AND SUPPORTED ALL THE WAY BUT IN THE MEAN TIME I THINK IT'S OKAY. TO PROVIDE SOME- AT LEAST- SOME PROVIDER ABILITY TO CHOOSE. I THINK THE OTHER THING IS GOING TO THE POINTS OF- SENATOR SKINNER IN THE CHAIR. THERE'S A LIST OF- JOBS THAT FOLKS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE TO APPLY FOR BECAUSE THEY HAVE BEEN INCARCERATED AND HAVE A RECORD IT WOULD BE INTERESTING TO FIND OUT WHAT KINDS OF SKILLS ARE NEEDED TO PRODUCE ALL OF THE THINGS THAT ARE IN THE INVENTORY OF PA AND THEN WHAT OF THOSE CORPS. WITH RESTRICTIONS ON PEOPLE BEING ABLE TO FIND EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO WORK TO LEARN HOW TO DO THAT AND THEN WHEN YOU COME OUT NOT AND SO WHAT OTHER- SKILLS AND WHAT OTHER JOBS UNDER THAT CAT. SO THAT. THE ALTERNATIVE VENDORS AND I'M GOING TO KEEP GOING DOWN THIS ROAD THEY WILL BE PROVIDING GLASSES FOR. THESE BLACK AND BROWN KIDS AS WELL OR IF OTHER KIDS TO. THE BRANCH THAT. AND THAT'S NOT OK IN ORDER TO ABOVE WOULD YOU OKAY I. SIN CENTER HOPEFULLY I DID NOT KNOW THE INDIVIDUAL WHO IS ON THE PHONE SO I UNDERSTAND THE FACETIOUS MISS OF YOUR QUESTION RIGHT YES EVERYBODY GETS TREATED EQUALLY IN THE SITUATION SO APOLOGIZE FOR. AS FARRAKHAN MARKERS AS- NOT ONLY BE AN INSENSITIVE BUT FAILING TO RECOGNIZE THE AUDIENCE. I WOULD HOPEFULLY AUSSIE WOULD STILL GIVE US AN AYE VOTE AND THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO. THANK YOU MR CHAOS APPROPRIATIONS- OUR MOTION ON THIS MOVE. BEEN MOVED BY SEN. MARTYR CANCEL PLEASE CALL ROLL ON AS RETAIN EIGHTY NINE. SB TEN EIGHTY NINE BRADFORD. BRED FOR NOT VOTING CHOI BOGUE HI BROUGH GUY COME LONGER COME LONGER AYE SKINNER. SKINNER I WINNER WINNER I. FOUR ZERO. I JUST CHECKED OKAY ALL RIGHT CENTER SKINNER EUROPE. YEAH. HI. VERY PLEASED TO SERVE TO PRESENT TO YOU SB NINE NINE THREE. CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WAS ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO RECOGNIZE THAT. VICTIMS OF CRIME DESERVE SUPPORT AND THAT WHEN YOU SUPPORT PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HAVE HAD A CRIMINAL ACT AGAINST THEM YOU CAN IMPROVE PUBLIC SAFETY IT'S NOT ONLY BE ETHICALLY MORALLY SMART THING TO DO. IT CREATES SAID TRUST IN- LAW ENFORCEMENT WHEN YOU FEEL THAT YOU- THAT REPORTING A CRIME THAT COOPERATION AND ALL IS GOING TO YOU KNOW TO CAN'T ALWAYS RESULT IN EITHER GETTING YOUR PERPETRATOR OR GETTING A CONVICTION BUT AT LEAST YOU CAN FEEL SUPPORTED. AND SO WE ESTABLISHED MANY YEARS AGO. THE WHOLE PROGRAM FOR AT THIS BY THE VICTIMS. BOARD WHERE WE PROVIDE FINANCIAL SUPPORT WE COVER- THE COST OF MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WE HAVE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS WE HAVE A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS. NOW WHAT'S INTERESTING THIS AS HAPPY. TIMES IS THAT WE HAVE NOT TREATED ALL VICTIMS EQUALLY AND WE HAVE A PATTERN OF THIS IN A VARIETY OF OUR DIFFERENT- I'M I'M GOING TO GIVE AN ANALOGY OF SO YOU KNOW I THINK MOST OF US HAVE BEEN ON THE PUBLIC SAFETY COMMITTEE FOR A LONG TIME AND WE KNOW THAT FOR YEARS. WE HAVE TO. YEAH TO BE TAKEN SERIOUSLY. AND WE HAD YEARS WHERE RAPE EVIDENCE WAS STUCK ON SHELVES AND NEVER DEALT WITH AND BECAUSE WE REALIZED THAT. FOR WHATEVER REASON LAW ENFORCEMENT PERHAPS SAW SOME OF THE PEOPLE WHO REPORTED RATE AS BEING SOMEHOW THAT THEY INVITED THAT. ATTACK THE WARNER WERE THE VICTIM. WELL WE HAVE A SIMILAR SITUATION AMONGST OTHER. PEOPLE THAT WERE SUBJECT TO COURT. YOU TO. BRITISH PROVISION SUPERVISION WELL THEN YOU'RE NOT TREATED AS YOU AND YET YOU ARE STILL SORE SUBJECT TO CRIMINAL ACT WHY IS IT ANY DIFFERENT YOU YOURSELF WAS INVOLVED IN IT YOU SHOULD HAVE JUST AS MUCH RIGHT TO THAT SUM. IF VICTIM THE WE ARE GOING TO IN SAFETY BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO IMPROVE THE COMMUNITY'S FEELINGS TOWARDS LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THEIR RESPONSIVENESS SO WHAT MY BILL DOES IS IGNORE IS THAT LESS THAN ONE IN FIVE CALIFORNIA CRIME SURVIVORS RECEIVE FINANCIAL HELP OR COUNSELING OR MEDICAL ASSISTANCE PART OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THINGS THAT WE'VE BUILT INTO THE PROGRAM THAT WE NEED TO GET RID OF AND PART OF IT IS BECAUSE WE DON'T FUND IT ADEQUATELY SO BILL WOULD IMPROVE THE ACCESS TO SUPPORT SERVICES FOR BOTH BUYERS CRIME ANY. INCREASE IN THE ACTUAL SUPPORT AVAILABLE AND PROVIDES SOME GUY INCREASE THE TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTER STREAMLINED PROCESS FOR THOSE BITS AND REMOVE SOME OF THE BARRIERS THAT CREATE IT HOLDEN SEPARATION DISPARITIES AND I ALSO HAVE SOME COMPONENTS FOR X. USED HEARD YOU'RE A BILL THAT WOULD BAR EXAM. NOW WE ALSO PUT EGGS RESTORED THE EVEN THE. WE'VE BEEN TO HAVE BEEN WRONGFULLY CAN. FOR THEM TO GET THEIR SUPPORT WE PUT THE THROUGH A LONG PROCESS IN MY ALSO ADDRESSES THAT IN WITHOUT I WOULD LIKE MY EXCELLENT. FIVE KEY WITNESSES SUPPORT NEEDS HOLLAND WHO'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CRIME SURVIVORS FOR SAFETY AND JUSTICE TO SPEAK AND THEN I HAVE A EXONERATED INDIVIDUAL JOE DIAZ WHO WILL CALL IN. THANK YOU CORRECT. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR GOOD EVENING TO ALL THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HEAR ME. I'M STANDING HERE THE BEGINNING OF NATIONAL CRIME VICTIMS RIGHTS WEEK IS THE KICKOFF FOR AN ANNUAL EVENT THAT CEASES J. ALSO HOLES ALL SURVIVORS SPEAK ARE WE HAVE OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND CRIME SURVIVORS IN OUR MEMBERSHIP HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WHICH MAKES THIS ONE OF THE LARGEST- CRIME SURVIVOR ADVOCACY ORGANIZATIONS HERE IN THE STATE AND WE CAME HERE TODAY RESPECTFULLY ASK THE STATE ACCOUNT IT MORE. IN X. OUR SEARCH. IN THE NEEDS FOR SURVIVORS ACROSS THE STATE. SB NINE THREE THREE DOES THAT IN MULTIPLE WAYS IN WHICH CENTER SKITTERED CENTER SKINNER JUST MENTION. AND WHAT WE HOPE IS THAT THE STATE BEGINS TO SEE ACCESS TO SUPPORT FOR VICTIMS SERVICES TRAUMA RECOVERY CENTERS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES AS A KEY PART OF THE SAFETY INSPECTION. BEING THAT WHEN SURVIVORS GET THIS TYPE OF SUPPORT RIGHT AWAY WE'RE LESS LIKELY TO SEE REPEAT INCIDENTS OF VIOLENCE AND CRIME IN THE COMMUNITIES WE ARE LESS LIKELY TO SEE PEOPLE WALKING AROUND WITH AN ADDRESS TRAUMA WHICH AFFECTS AND IMPACTS IN ALL KINDS OF WAYS WE KNOW THAT WE WILL SEE FOLKS HOUSING PROTECTED. THEIR EMPLOYMENT PROTECTED AND THAT IS THE SPIRIT BEHIND BILL HE CREATES SAFE COMMUNITIES BECAUSE IT ADDRESSES ALL THE BASIC NEEDS OF. THE VICTIMS AND SURVIVORS HAVE AFTER EXPERIENCING A CRIME. I KNOW THIS FROM PERSONAL EXPERIENCE. WEARING L. LOS MEMBERS OF MY IMMEDIATE FAMILY TO COME IS NOT AN EASY STORY TO TELL THE HARDEST ALREADY TELL IS THE IMPACT OF THOSE CRIMES YEAR AFTER YEAR ON MULTIPLE MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY HOW THE SANCTIONS THAT WERE CONNECTED TO MY BROTHERS WHO WERE INVOLVED IN THE CRIMINAL LEGAL SYSTEM BEFORE AT THE TIME OF THEIR DEATH WITHIN HANDED DOWN TO THEIR MOTHER SAYS THE SIBLINGS AND THE REST OF OUR FAMILY HERE TOO MANY INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT EXPERIENCE THIS AND DISPROPORTIONATELY IN COMMUNITIES OF COLOR SPECIFICALLY BLACK BROWN. AND IMMIGRANT COMMUNITY AND SO C. S. B. NINETY THREE B. AS AN OPPORTUNITY WE KNOW THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SPECIFICALLY VICTIMS COMPENSATION IN MANY WAYS HAS BEEN A MODEL AT WORK AND IT. MORE IN WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE SERVICES ARE ACCESSIBLE AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL BECAUSE WE KNOW. THAT WHEN SURVIVORS GET HELP RIGHT AWAY WHEN THE BARRIERS ARE REMOVED AND WHEN THEY'RE GETTING SUPPORT FROM PEOPLE THEY KNOW AND HAVE ONGOING ACCESS TO. TO SENATOR SKINNER'S POINT THEY ARE MORE LIKELY TO COOPERATE THEY ARE MORE LIKELY. TO GET THE JUSTICE THAT MANY DESERVE AND THAT THEY HAVE OPTIONS- FOR WITH THE JUSTICE AND COUNTABLY LOOKS LIKE THEM BECAUSE THERE'S HEALING INVOLVED. AND SO WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT THIS BILL TO CONTINUE MOVING ITS WAY THROUGH THE LEGISLATURE WE HOPE THAT YOU HEAR THE VOICES OF THOUSAND CRIMES BARBERS WHO HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR THE STATE. TO SHIFT ITS ATTENTION PRIOR TO HEALING MENTION AS PART OF PUBLIC SAFETY. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. NEXT WITNESS PLEASE STATE YOUR NAME AND ORGANIZATION.

A MISTER CHAIR- I APPRECIATE THE WITNESSES WHO FOR US SPOKEN AND GIVEN THEIR- SOME OF THEIR EXPERIENCES I JUST WANTED VERY QUICKLY IN MY CLOTHES RELATE I WAS ON THE BOARD OF A GROUP CALLED YOU TO LIVE IN THE TWO YEARS BETWEEN WHEN I WAS IN THE ASSEMBLY IN THE SENATE IN YOU TO LIVE IS A GUN VIOLENCE INTERVENTION ORGANIZATION IN S. IS. UTILIZED THOSE DIRECTLY TO THE HOSPITAL SO IN MY AREA IT GOES TO HIGHLAND HOSPITAL WHICH IS OUR MAIN TRAUMA CENTER SO GUNSHOT VICTIMS ARE BROUGHT THERE AND UTILIZING COUNSELORS ARE RIGHT THERE WHEN A GUNSHOT VICTIM ARRIVES AND WONDER IF WE RIGHTS TO. TO SUPPORT THE FAMILY TO HELP MINIMIZE AMENDED YOU KNOW WHEN YOU FEEL OFTEN IN THOSE KIND OF ANGRY MOMENTS THERE COULD BE A FAMILY MEMBER WHO WANTS TO TAKE JUSTICE INTO THEIR OWN HANDS SO ONE OF THE BEST GUN VIOLENCE INTERVENTIONS IS HELP BRING CALMNESS BRING SUPPORT SENATE.

WHY DESCRIPTION OF THAT IS MAYBE AN INARTICULATE WAY TO SAY HOW IMPORTANT THIS KIND OF VICTIM SUPPORT IS BUT THIS KIND OF VICTIM SUPPORT IS NOT ONLY ESSENTIAL TO THOSE VICTIMS JUST TO HELP THEIR TRAUMA.

NINE NINE THREE WE HAVE TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. SB NINE NINE THREE SKINNER BRADFORD BRADFORD I'D CHOI BOGUE JOBO GUY COME LONGER COMMA- I SKINNER HI SKINNER AYE WIENER. WIENER AYE FIVE ZERO FIVE ZERO THAT MEASURES OUT CONGRADULATIONS NOW RIGHT. YOU GO. THANK YOU SENATOR. THANK YOU SIR BRADFORD YOU MAY PRESENT SB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT ALL RIGHT I'M DOING AS WE TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WHICH IS WILL AMEND THE PUBLIC SAFETY OFFICERS PROCEDURAL BILL OF RIGHTS BETTER KNOWN AS POLL BARK TO PROVIDE THAT THE VIOLATIONOF THE ACT SHALL NOT BE THE BASIS FOR REVERSE OR MODIFY DISCIPLINE. IF A PERSON VIOLATIONS DEEP TO BE WITHOUT A SUBSTANTIVE THE FACT THIS HARMLESS ERROR RULE COMPARABLE TO WHAT IS APPLIED TO ISSUE PROCEEDINGS WOULD BE DETERMINED BY THE MINUTE OF HEARING OFFICER FOR BORDER. ARBITRATOR THE PILOT INCLUDE PROCEDURAL ERRORS INCLUDING MISSION ART OF EVIDENCE. UNLESS THE ERROR ADVERSELY AFFECTS A SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS OF THE OFFICER TO AN EXTENT THAT CONSTITUTES FUNDAMENTAL UNFAIRNESS. HARMLESS ERRORS INCLUDING TECHNICAL ERRORS THAT ARE NOT SO DAMAGING AND PREJUDICIAL ASK TO CHANGE THE OUTCOME OF AN INVESTIGATION OR DECISION AND WOOD CONSIDERATION OF THE TOTALITY OF THE DISPUTE WITH EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT IS SIGNIFICANT. ENOUGH TO OUTWEIGH THE CLAIM THAT AN ERROR WAS SUBSTANTIALLY ENOUGH SUBSTANTIAL ENOUGH. TO JUSTIFY CHANGING DISCIPLINE. SB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT APPLIES A COMMON LEGAL STANDARD USED IN VIRTUALLY ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS BOTH CIVIL AND CRIMINAL. TO PAUL WALKER. CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT HAS ALREADY APPLIED THE HARMLESS ERROR PRINCIPLES TO PROBAR IN REVERSING LOWER COURT RULINGS THIS BILL CLARIFIES THAT THE COURT'S APPLICATION OF THE HARMLESS ERROR RUSES NOT APPLICABLE MERELY UP. TO THE FACTS OF THAT CASE BUT TO ALL POLICE DISCIPLINE CASES IN THE STATE THAT FALL UNDER POOL BAR POOL BAR PROVIDES LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WITH AN EXTENSIVE LIST OF RIGHTS WHICH HAS THE FACT OF INSULATING OFFICERS FROM ACCOUNTABILITY. WHEN THEY- HAVE COMMITMENT COURSE BE FOLLOW TECHNICAL VIOLATIONS THAT DO NOT IMPAIR THE RIGHTS OF OFFICER OFTEN PRECLUDE AGENCIES FROM ADDRESSING SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. THE BILL DOES NOT INTEND TO ENCOURAGE EMPLOYEES TO ENGAGE IN PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS INVITING PROCEDURAL ERRORS RUNS THE RISK OF LOSING THE CASE AND COULD MAKE THEM SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL CIVIL PENALTIES NOR DOES THIS BILL AIMS TO TAKE AWAY RIGHTS AFFORDED TO OFFICERS. TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY IS VERY WANT TO GRAB PAST PRESIDENT AND NATIONAL ACADEMY ARBITRATORS AND LECTURE AT BERKELEY LAW SCHOOL AND RONALD YANK A RETIRED ENFORCEMENT UNION TURNING BURKE REPLACED THE PAST RECORD CAL HR UNDER GOVERNOR BROWN. THERE THERE ARE ALSO AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK RIGHTS. EXPECT THE BEEN HERE DAY. OKAY RUN ISSUE OR I'M VERY WINOGRAD ARE ME HAVE BEEN BY THE CHAIR. I WANT TO SAY PRELIMINARILY EIGHT AND A HALF HOURS PLUS WE'VE BEEN HERE I'VE RUN A DOZEN MARATHONS IN MY LIFE I'VE PRESIDED OVER HUNDREDS OF HEARINGS SITTING ALL DAY IN HEARINGS I TIP MY IF I WAS WEARING A HAT I TIP IT. YOU DESERVE IT AND I WISH THE PUMP. THE DEPTH AND SCOPE OF YOUR PROBING OF ISSUES OF PUBLIC SAFETY WITH THAT SAID- I AM A MEMBER OF THE LAW ENFORCEMENT REFORM STUDY GROUP ALONG WITH RON. THAT'S A SMALL GROUP SIX OF US. WE HAVE I THINK CUMULATIVELY OVER FOUR HUNDRED YEARS OF LIFE LIVING EXPERIENCE WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE OUR LATE SEVENTIES AND WE'RE ON THE YOUNGER END OF THAT GROUP. RIGHT IT INCLUDES JOE GRODINOF FORMER JUSTICE OF THE SUPREME COURT AND A LABOR LAWYER AND PROFESSOR EMERITUS AT HAYES A STINGS INCLUDES FELTON HENDERSON RETIRED U. S. DISTRICT COURT JUDGE- THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA- WHO PREVIOUSLY WAS IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION OF THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT. IT INCLUDES CATHERINE FIST A PROFESSOR OF LAW BERKELEY. IT INCLUDES JOHN TRUE A FORMER LABOR LAWYER. AND FORMER SUPERIOR COURT JUDGE IN ALAMEDA COUNTY INCLUDES NAY AND INCLUDES RUN. AMONG US WE HAVE PROBABLY ABOUT TWO HUNDRED YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN LABOR RELATIONS AFTER GEORGE FLOYD WAS KILLED- WE DECIDE WELL WHAT COULD WE DO. GOT WE GOT TOGETHER TO OUR WHEEL HOUSE IS LABOR RELATIONS WHAT. IN FOREIGN AND I FOUR OF US YOU ARE HAVE BEEN UNION LAWYERS IN OUR LIFE- WE DID NOT WANT TO ABOLISH COLLECTIVE BARGAINING WE DID NOT WANT TO GIVE ALL POWER TO POLICE CHIEFS. WE ARE NOT AT THAT END OF THE POLITICAL SPECTRUM WE DECIDED WE COULD COME UP WITH SOME PRETTY DECENT REFORMS AND WE PUT TOGETHER A PACKAGE. AND WE THANKED US SENATE BRADFORD. FOR GIVING CONSIDERATION TO ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT PIECES IN THIS PACKAGE THIS WHAT WE'LL CALL THIS HARMLESS ERROR BILL. IT FILLS A GAP IN THE OPPO BAR- WHICH NOW ONLY HAS A HE'S A VERY SPECIFIC PROVISION AS TO ENFORCEMENT AND IT ALLOWS FOR WIN THIS. LEGISLATION THIS ACT IS INCORPORATED IN COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WHICH IS UP AND DOWN THIS. ARBITRATE AS THE TIME FOR ME WELL THERE WAS THIS TECHNICAL PROCEDURAL VIOLATION REACTIVE FOR THIS PARTICULAR POLICE OFFICER SHOULD NOT BE FOUND TO ENGAGE IN WRONGDOING WHAT THAT GAP THIS IS IMPORTANT FOR POLICE TO CAD COUNT ABILITY IT ENDS RELIANCE ON TECHNICAL PROCEDURAL VIOLATIONS- THAT WILL EXCUSE MISCONDUCT THAT IS OTHERWISE PROVEN WHERE THERE'S NO PREJUDICE THERE'S NO LOSS OF THIS IS OF A SUBSTANTIAL RIGHT IMPORTANT FOR PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE- I. WENT UP A- CREATES A BAR REINSTATEMENT OF SERIOUS WRONGDOING WHEN THERE'S NO PREJUDICE IN TERMS OF SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS ON THE MERITS. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR TRANSPARENCY IT ALLOWS THE PUBLIC TO SEE WHAT IS GOING ON WITHOUT BURYING WRONG DOING BEHIND SOME TECHNICALITIES IT IS IMPORTANT FOR YOU. I AM ACTUALLY QUITE. IS THAT. THERE ARE SO MANY UNIONS WHO'VE EXPRESSED- CUT UNIFORM OPPOSITION- WHEN I AM I AM TOLD AND PRIVATE THERE ARE UNIQUE BLUES WHO THINK THIS IS GREAT. ON HAVE TO BE REPRESENTING SOME OF THE- V. P. WRONGDOERS TO CLOG UP THEIR OWN CALENDAR DETENTION. AND BY THE WAY NO PROSECUTION A GROUP THAT'S IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL SO THAT'S IN INTERESTING. I TOLD HEALTH. IS THE IMPORTANT TO THAT THERE ARE OTHER REMEDIES AVAILABLE. AND AND I THINK THAT REALLY SUMS UP WHAT I HAVE TO SAY ABOUT THIS- THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION WE THANK YOU AGAIN FOR YOUR ATTENTION AND SUPPORT. ALL RIGHT SO WHERE A- POLICE OFFICER DEPUTY SHERIFF GETS OFF ON A LOCAL A TECHNICALITY A POOL BAR VIOLATION- IT LOOKS HORRIBLE TO THE PUBLIC AFTER GEORGE AND VARIOUS OTHER ATROCIOUS IT INCIDENTS THAT WERE VISIBLE TO US ALL ON ON TELEVISION. OF THERE WAS A BACKLASH AGAINST ARBITRATION- IN GENERAL. NOW THAT'S NOT SO TERRIBLE FOR A WINNING UNION SIDE BECAUSE THEY CAN SAY LOOK THE ARBITRATORS LIKE A JUDGE HE SHE HEARD IT ON THE MERITS WE HAD A BETTER CASE WE WON. BUT WHEN THE OFFICER GETS OFF ON A TECHNICALITY IT LOOKS LIKE HOLY HECK- TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC THINK ABOUT HOW OF WHAT WOULD HELP BILL COSBY IT'S RELEASED FROM FROM PRISON AND THE HORROR OF THE PUBLIC- TO THAT. WHEN THE PUBLIC THINKS THAT THERE ARE DIRTY COPS. IN OUR DEPARTMENTS- THERE IS A HUGE BACKLASH BY THE WAY LET ME JUST GIVE A QUICK EXAMPLE OF A TECHNICAL VIOLATION- THAT- WOULD NOT ALLOW A REVERSAL IN OUR SITUATION SO THERE'S A TWELVE MONTH REQUIREMENT BUT APARTMENT LARGE OF A PROBLEM THEY STARTED INVESTIGATION THEY GOT A YEAR TO GO AHEAD AND BRING CHARGES. BUT BECAUSE OF POLICE DEPARTMENTS BEING UNDERSTAFFED THEY SEND EVERY COPY OF GOD ADAM STREET THE PAPERWORK IS LATE IT COMES IN IN THIRTEEN MONTHS HOWEVER IN THIS CASE THE OFFICER KNEW LIKE IN MONTH ONE WHO ALL THE WITNESSES AGAINST HIM OR HER WE'RE GOING TO BE SO BECAUSE THE CHARGES WERE BROUGHT IN THIRTEEN MONTHS INSTEAD OF UNDER TWELVE THE OFFICERS SUFFERED NO PREJUDICE AT ALL AND THAT CASE SHOULD NOT BE THROWN OUT AND YOU ARE. COMPARE I'M SUCH KIDS AN ANY EVENT TO THE PA BACKLASH- ON THE PERCEPTION AND OTHER THAN THE REALITY OF DIRTY COPS FROM YELLOW TO GEORGE FLOYD INCIDENT TO THE BLACK JOGGER IN AND AWAY INTO A SUBURB IT CETERA. THIS IS ALL OVER THE MEDIA. WORD OF MOUTH OBVIOUSLY POLICE OFFICERS ARE INNOCENT ONES THE VAST VAST MAJORITY ARE NOT ANYWHERE NEAR THE KIND OF VICTIMS- OF THOSE WHO SUFFERED FROM POLICEMAN'S MISCONDUCT OR OR THEIR FAMILIES AND LOVED ONES NONETHELESS MORALE HAS JUST DROPPED LIKE LIKE A STONE. WHAT YOU HAVE IS AN INCREDIBLE NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS RESIGNATIONS YOU'VE GOT A- MUCH LESS INTERESTED IN- YOUNG BRIGHT COOKIES THAT WE WANT TO BE- IN LAW ENFORCEMENT JOINING- AND APPLYING FOR POLICE ACADEMIES WHAT DOES THIS MEAN. THIS MEANS UNDERSTAFFED POLICE DEPARTMENTS LESS PROFESSIONAL POLICE DEPARTMENTS AND OBVIOUSLY LESS TRUST BETWEEN THE PUBLIC ON THE ONE HAND AND- THESE OFFICERS ON THE OTHER. IN A WAY AND AS BERRIES SAID. GETTING DIRTY COPS OUT OF DEPARTMENTS CAN EASILY BE SEEN AS A BENEFIT TO UNIONS THEY DON'T HAVE TO SPEND THEIR LEGAL DEFENSE MONEY DEFENDING SUCH OFFICERS HAD CETERA I'M GONNA COOK CLOSE WITH. THIS BILL. AUTHORED BY SENATOR BRADFORD DOES NO PREJUDICE TO ONE OFFICER IF THERE'S A POOL BAR VIOLATION- BECAUSE HE SHE- AGAIN IN MY THIRTEEN MONTH VERSUS TWELVE MONTH OF THE OFFICER KNEW THE WITNESSES ALL THE WAY SUFFERED NO PREJUDICE BY VIRTUE OF THE DELAY SPEAKING ABOUT HOLD HALF BOWLS BURYING ME WE'D BE HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS FROM ANY MEMBER OF THE COMMITTEE THROUGH THE- THIS. YOU SO MUCH SIR- I'M WOULD YOU MIND STATING YOUR NAME AND YOUR- AND WE'RE FROM FOR THE RECORD PLEASE ALL RIGHT SO MY NAME IS RON YANK- I WAS A- UNIONS ARE. A TURN FOR LIKE THIRTY YEARS I RETIRE FOR COUPLE YEARS JERRY BROWN GETS SELECTED JERRY BROWN ASKED ME TO SWITCH SIDES OF THE TABLE AND REPRESENT THIS STATE. AND HIM AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGAINST THE UNIONS THAT REFUSED TO CLOSE AN AMMO YOU- WITH ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER. OF SO- I TOLD THE GOVERNOR I COULD DO IT ONLY FOR A YEAR BECAUSE MY FAIR. MOST IMPORTANT. IN THE BAY AREA. AND THEN THREE YEARS LATER I TAKE A JOB WITH FELTON HENDERSON TRYING TO CLOSE THE CONSENT DECREE- OF THE OAKLAND POLICE DEPARTMENT. SO I'M AYE THERE WAS ANOTHER JOB I HELD I'M ON MY THIRD RETIREMENT THAT BUT THE TWINS GOING TO STICK. YEAH BUT I THINK RUN ONLY HAD TO PENSIONS. IN IN SAY THAT THE UNIONS HE REPRESENTED FOR THIRTY PLUS YEARS FOR PUBLIC SAFETY POLICE AND FIRE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND AT THE LOCAL LEVEL ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND THERE WERE FEW IF ANY. WHO A FEW HAVE ANY. THE KIDS. WHO HAD A DEPRESSIVE PRACTICE AND THE TRUST IN PRACTICE THAT RUN HAD. SO I'LL JUST ADD THAT IN DEFERENCE TO- MY CALLING. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ADD TO BOTH OF YOU FOR BEING HERE AND TESTIFYING NOW LET'S BEGIN WITH ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE- IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT. LESLIE CALDWELL HOUSTON FOR THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC DEFENDERS ASSOCIATION AND SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF S. B.

THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SB TEN EIGHTY EIGHT PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR HAVING HEARD FROM ALL SUPPORTERS WILL NOT FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS IN HERE FROM THE OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE TO LEAD OPPOSITION WITNESSES- WE HAVE DAVID- MUSTARD. MUSTARD GARNI JUNIOR AND I APOLOGIZE IF I MISPRONOUNCE YOUR NAME I BELIEVE MAYBE IN PERSON- I AM OVER THE LINE. DAVID ARE YOU ON THE LINE. YES I AM CAN YOU HEAR ME ABSOLUTELY PLEASE PROCEED SIR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND GOOD EVENING I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPEAR HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF PORAC. I'M A LABOR ATTORNEY IN FACT I STUDY LABOR LAW UNDER PROFESSOR WINOGRAD AT BERKELEY. AND I UNDERSTAND THE IMPORTANCE OF PROCEDURAL REPRESENTATION RIGHT. WHICH IS WHY WE ARE SO IMPORTANT. MY CLIENTS AND I HAVE WORKED WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND LEADERSHIP TO ADDRESS MANY OF THE CONCERNS UNDERLYING THE STILL. INCLUDING MODERNIZING FOR STANDARDS INCREASING TRANSPARENCY AND CENTER BRADFORD TO DELL. WHICH SET UP PROCEDURE FOR DECERTIFYING OFFICERS WHO COMMIT LIKE TO CLARIFY WHAT WILL BE OUR DOES AND DOESN'T THOUGH. YOU'LL BE ARE PRIMARILY PROVIDES PROCEDURAL RIGHTS DURING AN INVESTIGATION THAT LARGELY MIRRORED THE RIGHTS THAT UNIONS HAVE. IT'S NOT ABOUT GETTING OFF ON A TECHNICALITY IT'S ABOUT THINGS LIKE BEFORE AN OFFICER IS QUESTIONED OR INTERROGATED THEY RECEIVED NOTICE THE RIGHT TO GET A REPRESENTATIVE THE RIGHT TO RECORD THE INTERVIEW THE RIGHT TO USE THE RESTROOM. IT'S ALSO ABOUT DUE PROCESS. THAT OFFICERS RECEIVE THE RIGHT TO ACCESS THEIR PERSONNEL FILE REVIEW ADVERSE COMMENTS RIGHT REBUTTALS OBTAIN EXCULPATORY MATERIAL THAT ARE WITHHELD FROM AN INTERNAL AFFAIRS INVESTIGATION. THESE REMEDIES ARE REALLY MODERATE. I MERRILY DEAL WITH THE ADMISSIBILITY OF THE ACCESS TO EVIDENCE. THE FIRST REMEDY THAT YOU USUALLY SEE IS SUPPRESSION IS MODELED AFTER THE EXCLUSIONARY RULE IN CRIMINAL JUSTICE. UNLAWFULLY OBTAINED STATEMENTS OR EVIDENCE MAY BE EXCLUDED WERE APPROPRIATE SECURE A VIOLATION AND TO THIS INCENTIVIZE AGENCIES FROM CONTINUING TO HAVE FURTHER VIOLATIONS SECONDLY IT ALSO FOR. AIMED AT IMPROPERLY WITHHELD THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT AS ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS OFTEN PROCEDURES AND ACCESS TO THAT INFORMATION I'VE SUCCESSFULLY ENFORCED POV ARE RIGHT ON SEVERAL OCCASIONS OVER MY CAREER AND I CAN TELL YEAH IN NONE OF THOSE CASES IN A PROCEDURAL VIOLATION RESULT IN A DISCIPLINE BEING OVERTURNED. MOST OF THE CASES I'VE HANDLED INVOLVED THE SUPPRESSION OF OFFICERS STATEMENT WHERE THEY WERE UNLAWFULLY INTERROGATED WITHOUT A UNION RAP. IN THOSE CASES WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE COURT EXPRESSLY ALLOW THE AGENCY TO CONTINUE TO PURSUE THE DISCIPLINARY CASE BUT SIMPLY PROHIBITED THE AGENCY FROM USING THE ILL GOTTEN STATEMENT. IN FACT IN ALL OF THOSE CASES. THE CIRCUMSTANCES WERE AN OFFICER WAS INTERROGATING CARYATID WITHOUT A RAPID WITHOUT NOTICE ON THE SPOT THEY WERE SUBSEQUENTLY SENT TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS AND THE RIGHTS WERE AFFORDED TWO ONE AND THE SUBSEQUENT STATEMENT IN INFERNAL AFFAIRS IS IT AND WAS ADMISSIBLE IN THE COURT ALLOWS THE CASE TO GO FORWARD JUST LIKE IN A CRIMINAL CASE WHERE. EVIDENCE IS IMPROPERLY OBTAINED. THE OTHER TYPE OF CASES THAT I'VE DEALT WITH INVOLVED ACCESS TO MATERIAL MIGHT IN FACT ARE YOU ONE OF THE SEMINAL IS. THE SACRAMENTO POLICE OFFICERS ASSOCIATION VERSES AND I GUESS THAT PUBLISHED THIRD DISTRICT COURT OF APPEAL DECISION. THAT ESTABLISHED THAT PEACE OFFICERS HAVE A RIGHT TO ACT THAT ADVERSE COMMENTS CONTAINED IN THEIR INTERNAL AFFAIRS FILES THAT ARE USED TO HINDER. THEIR CAREER PATH MISTER MAGOO. MR MYSTIC JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT- YOU'RE JUST ABOUT TWO MINUTES AND IT'S GOING INTO THE SECOND WITNESSES TIME FRAME- HELLO ALPALA. AB THE SECOND LEAD OPPOSITION WITH WITNESS MISTER RYAN SHERMAN IS GIVING UP HIS TIME OR A LOT OF TIME THAT YOU MAY NEED IN ORDER TO TESTIFY SO. PLEASE PROCEED. I APPRECIATE THAT- AND THANK YOU RYAN. THIS BILL IS ALSO AN UNNECESSARY BECAUSE THE SUPREME COURT RULED A LONG TIME AGO IN NINETEEN. EIGHTY EIGHT. THAT SB IT'S AN ABUSE OF DISCRETION. TO OVERTURN DISCIPLINE OR EVEN THERE'S A PRESS THE STATEMENT CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OVER MINOR VIOLATIONS. THE GREEN COURT PRESIDENT IS BINDING ON EVERY CORNER IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING ON THE MINISTRY OF BODIES THE COURT IN THAT CASE LAY DOWN ABOUT FOUR ANALYSIS WHEN CONSIDERING A VIOLATION AND SAID THAT REINSTATEMENT IS NOT PROPER. WHERE THE EMPLOYER WOULD HAVE REACHED THE SAME CONCLUSION WITHOUT THE KHOBAR VIOLATION NOT VERY CONSISTENT WITH ALL OF MY EXPERIENCES THE COURT EVEN IN THAT CASE THAT THIS IMPRESSION WAS THAT ARE IT WHEN THEY. TEACHER IT TURNS IT BACK IN THE COURT SAID ALSO THAT THE PRESIDENT IS APPROPRIATE IN SOME CASES. WHERE IT'S AN EFFECTIVE DETERRENT. THIS BILL WOULD PREVENT THE TRIER OF FACT FROM HAVING THE DISCRETION TO FASHION A REMEDY FOR POPE ARE VIOLATIONS WHENEVER THE EVIDENCE OF MISCONDUCT IS THE NAME AGAIN AND NOT. WAITING TO THE BILL OUTWEIGH THE SIGNIFICANT OF THE VIOLATION. IT WOULD CREATE A PERVERSE ENDS JUSTIFY THE MEANS INCENTIVE FOR INVESTIGATORS THAT WOULD BE UNACCEPTABLE IN ANY OTHER CONTEXT. NO ONE WOULD SUPPORT ALLOWING POLICE INVESTIGATORS THE VIOLATE MARANDA OR FOURTH AMENDMENT RIGHTS JUST BECAUSE THE INVESTIGATORS BELIEVE THE SUSPECT. COMMITTED A SERIOUS CRIME THE SAME APPLIES HERE. RIGHT THE CONVERSE IS REALLY TRUE THE MORE SERIOUS THE MATTER THE MORE IMPORTANT IT IS FOR INVESTIGATORS TO FOLLOW THE RULES AND FOR PEOPLE THE RIGHT. THIS BILL GOES TOO FAR BY ELIMINATING THE TRIER OF FACT ABILITY TO EXCLUDE IMPROPER EVIDENCE AND INCENTIVIZING INTERROGATION VIOLATIONS BY ELIMINATING AGENCY ACCOUNTABILITY WE SHOULD NOT BE ENCOURAGING ANY LAW ENFORCEMENT INVESTIGATOR TO CUT CORNERS. ORDER I ONLY WRITE IN ANY CONTEXT WE NEED A CULTURE THAT FOSTERS OFFICERS AFFORDING RIGHT. AND MISTER CHAIRMAN YOUR BILL SB TWO ALSO OBVIATES THE NEED FOR THIS BILL. BECAUSE THAT'S THE TO PROVIDE. PROCEDURE YOU SORT OFFICERS. WHO ENGAGED IN SERIOUS MISCONDUCT. SIGNIFICANTLY YOU'LL BE ALRIGHT DO NOT APPLY AT ALL IN THE SB TWO DECERTIFICATION PROCESS OR PROCEDURES. THAT IT'S UNNECESSARY CLUTTER PEEL BR WITH A BALANCING TEST BETWEEN THE VIOLATION. AND WE'RE GONNA HAVE A LAST MINUTE ON THAT TO CLOSE- THE YOU'VE BEEN GIVEN- MR TIME MISTER SHERMAN'S TIME AS WELL JUST ABOUT TWO AND A HALF MINUTES.

IT IS A- IN THOSE ARE REQUIRE TO PUT BACKGROUND CHECKS ON APPLICANTS CAN NO LONGER USE THESE IDENTIFIERS WHEN CONDUCTING RECORD CHECK THEY WILL BE LEFT WITH. NOTHING BUT NAMES AND LITTLE OR NO WAY TO ASSOCIATE THE COURT RECORD WITH A SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL. THE ALL OR NOTHING ALL OF US- NINE VERSUS HAMBURG DECISION DID NOT.

INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AVAILABLE AVAILABLE TO ANSWER ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AND I RESPECT LESS RELIABLE. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD- BELIEVE WE HAVE MR KEN OLIVER IN PERSON. HI MY NAME IS KEN OLIVER I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AT CHECKER DOT ORG HOW GREAT TO SEE SOME FAMILIAR FACES A HERE IN THIS HEARING TODAY- I LIKE TO START OUT JUST BY GIVING A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT ABOUT MY OWN BACKGROUND- I AM JUSTICE IMPACTED- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO. DON'T KNOW- I SPENT TWENTY FOUR YEARS AND CAL PUBLIC BINS AND UPON MY RELEASE TO THE BAY AREA WENT TO WORK FOR A PUBLIC INTEREST LAW FIRM AS A POLICY DIRECTOR- SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO HAVE UP TESTIFIED FOR AND WITH- IN THE WORK AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WAS IMPORTANT TO ME- I'M ALSO. BANDBOX WHAT HAD A OP DIFFERENT COMPANIES UP AND DOWN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. EDUCATING THEM AND DOING ADVOCACY. FAIR CHANCE EMPLOYMENT- SINCE I'VE BEEN HOME. I'VE ALWAYS LOOK FOR MEANINGFUL WAYS TO IMPACT THE JUSTICE IMPACTED COMMUNITY IN A POSITIVE WAY- AFTER MY STINT AS A POLICY DIRECTOR I WENT ON TO LEAD. A WORKFORCE DEVELOPING ORGANIZATION BY THE NAME OF CROP WHERE I WAS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND PARTNER WITH THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE CALIFORNIA WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT BOARD TO BUILD OUT THE- REST OF THE DENTURE. THREE TEXANA PROGRAM- IN ENTRY- SINCE MY WORK THERE I NOW WENT ON TO WORK IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR CHECKER DOT ORG- SOME COMPANY MISSION. IS FAIR CHANCE EMPLOYMENT IN FACT CHECKER IS A TECH COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA. BOY MORE PER. IMPACT WHO'VE COME. AS IN ANY OTHER COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA TECH COMPANY THAT IS. CHECKER IS A BACKGROUND CHECK COMPANY. BUT THE MISSION AS I MENTIONED IS FAIR CHANCE EMPLOYMENT AND EMPLOYEE OVER SEVENTY- JUSTICE IMPACTED PEOPLE AND THEY'RE FUNDAMENTALLY RETHINKING BACKGROUND CHECKS BASED WHEN I LOOK AT THE WORK IN THE THAT I DO EVERY DAY TO GET PEOPLE TO LEVEL. ACCESS AND I'M A BIT. THE THIS IS AN EXTENSION OF THE FAIR CHANCE ACT BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS ACCESS TO LIVABLE WAGE JOBS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA- I SUPPORT SB TWELVE SIXTY TWO BECAUSE IT WOULD RESOLVE A LOT OF THE DELAYS THAT DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECT. BLACK AND BROWN PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA FROM ACCESSING WORK. I MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ABOUT HELPING PEOPLE ACCESS WORK THE QUICKEST IN THE FASTEST. AND THAT'S ESPECIALLY TRUE WHEN INDIVIDUALS HAVE GIVEN CONSENT. FOR BACKGROUND CHECKS IN ORDER TO ACCESS EMPLOYMENT- FOR MYSELF I WOULD DO A BACKGROUND CHECK EVEN THOUGH I DID TWENTY FOUR YEARS IN A CALIFORNIA PRISON AT CHECKER AND OTHER COMPANIES THAT I WORK FOR- AND THAT WAS AN IMPORTANT STEP. IN ORDER FOR ME TO GET TO THE H. R. PROCESS TALK ABOUT. SOME OF THE MISTAKES THAT I'VE MADE IN MY LIFE AND MOVE ON TO THE NEXT TO DECORATE- A THAT LEVEL WEIGHT AND I'VE BEEN ABLE TO ACCESS- I WOULD EXPRESS MY SUPPORT THERE I ALSO UNDERSTAND THAT. SOME OP POSITION THE COURT BACKGROUND CHECK- I WOULD JUST SAY AS MUCH AS I LOVE I'M A PROP REVOLVES ARE NONE. DO LEGALS. AND I THINK THAT THE APPROACH ABOUT PRIVACY GOOD ONE- BUT I ALSO THINK THAT ONCE THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN IMPACTED GIVE THAT PERMISSION TO COMPANIES TO ACCESS OUR OWN PERSONAL INFORMATION WHICH IS YOU KNOW IT'S A PUBLIC RECORD AT THAT POINT- THAT WE SHOULD BUT ALLOW YOU TO ACCESS OUR INFORMATION AN EXPEDIENT MANNER SO THAT WAY DOESN'T DELAY THE HIRING PROCESS SOMETIMES CAN TAKE TWO THREE FOUR FIVE MONTHS DEPEND ON THE COURT L. A. COUNTY IT'S GOTTEN A LOT BETTER BUT THERE'S ON THE COUNTER A LOT SLOWER- AND SO IT ACTUALLY DOES HAMPER US FROM BEING ABLE TO ACCESSIBLE IMAGE- THAT'S MY TESTIMONY TODAY AND THAT'S WHY SUPPORT TWELVE SIXTY TWO WOULD APPRECIATE AND- BE MORE THAN GLAD TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS IF THERE ARE ANY.

GOOD EVENING KAREN COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS ENOUGH WITH KNOWLEDGE AND I'M A LEGISLATIVE COORDINATOR AT PUBLIC ADVOCATE AND WE ARE IN SUPPORT SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAME MODERATOR HAVING HER FROM ALL THE SUPPORTERS WILL NOW FOLLOW THE SAME PROCESS AND HEAR FROM ANY OPPOSITION WE DO HAVE AB ONE LEAD. A POSITION THE- ON RECORD LUCIA MISHLER. ARE YOU ON THE LINE. OKAY. OKAY SO LET'S MOVE ON TO ANY WITNESSES HERE IN ROOM ONE TWELVE IN OPPOSITION OF TWELVE SEVENTY THREE. THANK MILLION VICE CHAIR I WOULD BE ALRIGHT IF I WERE TO. GIVE ABOUT A MINUTE OR TWO- PRESENTATION SINCE MISS- MUTCHLER WASN'T ABLE TO WRITE HER TESTIMONY I CERTAINLY. THANK YOU. THE THOUSANDS OF MEMBERS OF THE RIVERSIDE SHERIFF'S ASSOCIATION AND NUMEROUS LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT GROUPS MANY OF WHICH REPRESENTS SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS WHO SWORN DUTY IS TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN ENSURE THEIR SAFETY ON CAMPUS. INCLUDING THE CLAREMONT PL A IN THE PLA'S OF CROP MONOCLE'S FORESEES NEWPORT. UPLAND SANTA ANA BURBANK. INGLEWOOD ARCADIA RIVERSIDE. THE ONLY SCHOOL PLEASE FOR TEN CULVER CITY PO WAYS ALL ARE EXTREMELY OPPOSED TO- SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE A MEASURE THAT WOULD ENDANGER OUR SCHOOLS. TEACHERS RESOURCE OFFICERS AND ESPECIALLY THE STUDENTS. THIS ILL CONCEIVED BILL SEEKS TO PROTECT THOSE WHO ENTER SCHOOL GROUNDS TO HARM OTHERS. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES THAT ANY PERSON WHO WILLFULLY THE SERBS WILL SKIP OVER THAT PART I THINK IT WAS TAKEN CARE OF IN THE AMENDMENTS MY APOLOGIES- I. THINK THE MOST IMPORTANT PART OF THIS IS THAT. THE GOAL OF THE SCHOOL RESOURCE OFFICERS TO PROTECT THE KIDS. AND THIS BILL WOULD MAKE IT MUCH MORE DIFFICULT BECAUSE- MANDATED REPORTERS WILL NO LONGER BE MANDATED TO REPORT TO THEM FOR MANY OF THESE CRIMES- THAT ARE OCCURRING ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES INCLUDING BRINGING. A DEADLY WEAPONS ON CAMPUS- ASIDE FROM FIREARMS. THERE'S SOME OTHER THINGS- THAT THIS BILL WOULD ALSO NO LONGER REQUIRE THESE MANDATE REPORTERS PROVIDE- CONTACT TO LAW ENFORCEMENT- SO WE'RE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THAT ALSO I KNOW THAT THE ADVOCATES HAVE. A MENTION THAT WHILE THEY'RE STILL ALLOWED TO REPORT OR JUST NOT MANDATED TO REPORT HOWEVER THERE'S SECTION THE BILL THAT STRIPS THE CIVIL IMMUNITY PROTECTIONS FROM THESE REPORTERS. AND SO THAT'S A CONCERN FOR US BECAUSE NOW PEOPLE WHO MAY REPORT AND GET IT TO INCORRECT- WILL BE SOLELY LIABLE FOR MAKING SUCH A REPORT WHEREAS RIGHT NOW THEY HAVE THE PROTECTIONS UNDER THE MANDATED REPORTER LAWS SO FOR THOSE AND MANY OTHER REASONS THAT I WON'T GET INTO RIGHT NOW WE REMAIN. STRONGLY REQUEST THE- MISTER SHERMAN- DO WE HAVE ANY OTHER WITNESSES HERE IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE THIRTY THREE SEIGNER- WILL NOW MOVE ON TO WITNESSES WAITING TO TESTIFY VIA TELECONFERENCE ARE VERSUS WILL TAKE TEN MINUTES OF TESTIMONY MODERATE IF YOU WOULD PLEASE. PLEASE PROMPT THE INDIVIDUALS WAITING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION OF SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE WE WILL BEGIN. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MATTER MODERATORS WOULD MIND CHECKING THE LINES ONE MORE TIME JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'VE GIVEN EVERYBODY AN OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU IF YOU WISH TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE PLEASE PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. I HAVE NO COMMENT THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH MATTER MODERATOR AND THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOT BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO THE MEMBERS. DO ANY F OUR MEMBERS HAVE ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS- SENATOR KAMLAGER. YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY THAT- EMINEM BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME I MOVE IT- YOU KNOW I THINK IT'S JUST IMPORTANT TO SAY. THAT NOT EVERY SOLUTION. NEEDS TO INVOLVE LAW ENFORCEMENT I THINK YOU KNOW. SCHOOL SETTINGS ARE ABOUT LEARNING. AND THERE ARE SO MANY WAYS. THAT ADULTS ARE INTERESTED IN- INNOVATIVELY CREATIVELY. COLLABORATIVELY FINDING WAYS TO ENSURE THAT RESPECT. AN ORDER ARE HAPPENING IN SCHOOL SETTINGS. I MEAN WE JUST HAD A SITUATION HERE WHERE PEOPLE WERE UNHAPPY WITH A VOTE. AND THEY SCREAMED OBSCENITIES. INCREDIBLY DISRUPTIVE. NO ONE THOUGHT TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT. TO SETTLE THAT. AND SO I THINK THE OLD. MORE OFTEN THAT WE DECIDE THAT EVERY PROBLEM DESERVE SOMETHING IN THE PENAL CODE. THE GREATER WE SET OURSELVES UP FOR FAILURE OTHER WAYS TO SOLVE PROBLEMS TO RESOLVE CONFLICT TO ASK FOR ENGAGEMENT IN SO MANY SCHOOLS PARENTS VOLUNTEERS ALUMNI ARE ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN MAKING SURE THAT SCHOOL SETTINGS. HAVE THE KIND OF CULTURE THAT PROMOTES BOTH CIVIL DISCOURSE. YOU KNOW AS WELL AS LEARNING AND OTHER FORMS OF ENGAGEMENT SO IT BECOMES TIRESOME TO THINK THAT EVERY ANSWER HAS TO BE AN ADDITIVE TO THE PENAL CODE LAW ENFORCEMENT DOESN'T WANT TO HAVE TO BE THE SOLUTION TO EVERY SINGLE THING. AND WE HAVE TO COME UP WE HAVE TO AT SOME POINT IN KNOWLEDGE THAT THE HUMAN CONDITION INVOLVES TENSION. AND AS LONG AS YOU'RE NOT VIOLENTLY ATTACKING SOMEONE OR DOING SOMETHING ILLEGAL SOMETIMES TENSION IS OKAY. AND SORT OF A PRESSING SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH THIS NOTION THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT SHOULD BE ENGAGED IS NOT HEALTHY AND MANDATED REPORTERS ARE NOT ALWAYS APPROPRIATELY TRAINED IN OFTENTIMES THEY ARE RECORDING WITH BIAS. AND THEY ARE INCREDIBLY CONSERVATIVE IN WHAT THEY SAY BECAUSE THEY'RE NERVOUS ABOUT BEING LIABLE FOR SOMETHING SO I DON'T WE SHOULD ALSO A RACE FROM OUR MIND THE THINKING THAT MANDATED REPORTERS ARE CLOSE TO GOD IN WHAT THE REPORTING WHAT THEY SEE. SORRY FOR THE RANT BECAUSE I KNOW WE'VE BEEN HERE REALLY LONG TIME. BUT I JUST HAD TO SAY THAT AND I'M GONNA BE SUPPORTING THIS BILL. THANK YOU SENATOR COME. YOU HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. I'M CENTER COMMAGER YOU MOVE THE BILL YEAH. OKAY. ANYONE ELSE. I'M SO JUST FOR THE RECORD ARE THE SERGEANTS CONSIDER PEACE OFFICERS. YEAH THE ONES HERE. THERE IF. THEY'RE NOT THEY'RE NOT. GOT IT OKAY PERFECT- SO WE HAVE A MOTION BY SENATOR COME LONGER THE MOTION IS. DO PASSED BUT FIRST REFER. TO HAVE THE RIGHT ONE. DO PASSED BUT FIRST WE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS- LET OF THE SULTAN PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. OH SORRY I APOLOGIZE THE NUMBER THIRTY. WHEN- YOU GUYS HERE ANY LONGER THAN YOU NEED TO BE BUT I JUST THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE MEASURE WE'VE JUST SEEN OVER THE LAST COUPLE YEARS THE NUMBER OF KIDS. AS YOUNG AS FIVE YEARS OLD BEING HANDCUFFED AND ARRESTED BY POLICE AND IT MAKES ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE AND ONE PARENT JUST WON A RECORD HE SAYS HE SEVEN YEARS OLD HE'S NOT A CRIMINAL. AND AT SOME POINT YOU HAVE TO QUIT TREATING KIDS LIKE THEY'RE ADULTS AND LIKE ANY ACT OF MISBEHAVIOUR WILLFUL DEFIANCE AS WE'VE SEEN AFRICAN AMERICAN LATINO KIDS HAVE BEEN EXPELLED FROM SCHOOL ADDED NORMA'S RATE COMPARED TO THEIR WHITE COUNTERPARTS BASED ON WHAT IS WILLFUL DEFIANCE NOT BRINGING HOME WORKER AND I HAVE AN OPINION PAPER DID IT DO CLASS WORK BEING SENT TO THE PRINCE'S OFFICE AND BE REFERRED TO LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND I COMMAND LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT BOARD MEMBER- GEORGE MCKENNA FOR TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO MOVE TO REMOVE UNIFORM OFFICERS OFF THE CAMPUSES I MEAN WHEN I WENT TO SCHOOL WITH HIM UNIFORM OFFICERS AND IT'S STILL NEED FORM THERE I MEAN WILL THERE BE TIMES WHEN YOU NEED TO CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT YESTERDAY BUT WHEN YOU HAVE A- KINDERGARTEN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL SCHOOL KIDS ACTING OUT A NORMAL BEHAVIOR. AS REQUIRE A POLICE RESPONSE SO AGAIN I HOPE YOU FIND THIS TO BE A COMMON SENSE BUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. THANK YOU FOR MUCH AND I ROUGHER AND WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND A REPEAT OR TIMER. OKAY I DON'T CONSULTANCIES CHOLERA SB TWELVE SEVENTY THREE BRADFORD TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS BRADFORD. BRADFORD I'D SHOW BOTH. TROUBLED NOT VOTING COM LONGER COM LONGER AYE SKINNER. SKINNER AYE WIENER. WE WILL CALL THE ROLL OPEN OR ARE ABSENT MEMBERS. AND ONE MORE. SENATOR BRADFORD- YOU HAVE SB. THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE. ALL RIGHT GOOD NOT LEAST THIRTY SEVENTY ONE WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE SECRETARY OR CDC ARE TO INCREASE THE PAY SCALE FOR THOSE WORKING WHILE INCARCERATED OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD THIS BILL REQUIRES THAT THIS ADJUSTED PAY SCALE BE RAISED TO ADEQUATELY ALLOW AN INCARCERATED PERSON TO AMONG OTHER THINGS AFFORD QUARTERLY PACKAGES PURCHASE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS AND MAINTAIN FAMILY CONNECTIONS EXISTING LAW THAT. STATES THAT CDC ARCHER REQUIRED EVERY ABLE BODIED PRISONER IMPRISONED IN ANY STATE PRISON AS MANY HOURS OF FATEFUL. IN EACH EVERY DAY DURING HIS OR HER TERM OF IN IMPRISONMENT APPROX FOR FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND INCARCERATED PEOPLE ARE ASSIGNED JOBS THAT HELP MAINTAIN AND OPERATE- STATE'S PRISONS WE HEARD ABOUT SOME THE DAY THE OP- OP TO OPTOMETRIST OR OPTOMETRIC SO MAKING GLASSES AND- EVEN UNDERGARMENTS AT SENATOR- KAMAGRA SHARED. THESE. CAN LEAD TO YOU KNOW. BANK ONE POINT HOPEFULLY OUTSIDE BUT THEY ALSO DO WORK SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND CLARKEN CONSTRUCTION LABORS WELL THESE JOBS WITHIN CDC OURS. SEPARATE FROM THE PRISON INDUSTRIAL AUTHORITY JOINT VENTURE PROGRAM AND THE FAR CAMPS CAN PAY AS LITTLE AS EIGHT CENTS. FOR OUR AND AS MUCH AS THIRTY SEVEN CENTS PER HOUR INCARCERATED STAFF IN FIRE CAMPS MAKE UP TO AS MUCH AS THREE DOLLARS AND NINETY CENTS PER DAY WHILE THOSE EMPLOYED BY. CAL P. I A CAN MAKE AS MUCH AS ONE DOLLAR PER HOUR THIS IS EXPLOIT THIS EXPLOITATION OF AN UNACCEPTABLE AND HAS MADE IT INCREASINGLY DIFFICULT TO. FOR INCARCERATED PEOPLE TO PAY THEIR CENTER ITEMS AND EVEN HAVE FUN FOR. A FAMILY CONTACT AND EVEN THEIR RESTITUTION AS A RESULT MANY INCARCERATED PEOPLE FORCED TO LEAN ON LOVED ONES FOR FINANCIAL SUPPORT WE JUST SAW. EARLIER IT'S ALSO ABOUT PHONE CALLS AND BE ABLE TO MAKE. PHONE CALLS HOME ON WITH THESE HIGHER WAGES THEY WILL BUILD A FOR TO MAKE THOSE EXPENSIVE PHONE CALLS OF THE WAGES EARNED BY THE INMATE IN THE MONEY TO PUT INTO A MH TRUST ACCOUNT. BY FAMILY OR LOVED ONES IS SUBJECT TO A 50% BEING. THE TECHNICIAN. ARE WE THAT THAT RESTED AMOUNT FOR INCOME INDIVIDUALS IS ABOUT SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS HOWEVER AN INMATE CAN WORK AN ENTIRE YEAR AS A LABOR AND MAKE EIGHT CENTS PER HOUR AND AT THE END OF THE YEAR THEY WOULD HAVE ONLY MADE A HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR DOLLARS WOULD SEVENTY TWO OF THOSE DOLLARS GOING TO RESTITUTION MAKING AN INSIGNIFICANT DENT IN THE TOTAL MODELED. BY PROVIDING CURSORY PEOPLE WITH A FAIR WAGE SB THIRTEEN SEVENTY ONE CAN HELP PEOPLE FIVE FINANCIAL RESTITUTION FOR CANTEEN ITEMS AND I HAVE THE MEANS TO STAY IN CONTACT WITH FAMILY AND SAVE MONEY FOR ENTRY EXPENSES THIS BILL WILL COME WILL CONTINUE TO BE WORKED WITH DELTA ME IDENTIFIES CIVIC CHIEF. SO TRICKS AS WELL AS THE CROWD A BY REQUEST THE FUND THIS INCREASE TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AS ESTEBAN NEWNESS WITH ANTI RECIDIVISM. AND ALSO DRAW OSBI WITH COMMUNITY INTERVENTIONS I RESPECT WEST RIVAL. THANK YOU SENATOR BRADFORD WE WILL NOW PROCEED WITH OUR WITNESSES ARE LEAD WITNESSES ESTEBAN OON YES ARE YOU ON THE LINE HE SAID THAT- I APOLOGIZE NO WORRIES- IT A LONG DAY. YOU'RE HAS- THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ESTEBAN UNIONS AND I'M HERE REPRESENTING THE ANTI RECIDIVISM COALITION. CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF ON BEING A LEADER IN ADVOCATING FOR FAIR AND JUST WAGES FOR OUR LABOR FORCE INCLUDING GIG MIGRANT AND FACTORY WORKERS TO NAME A FEW. HOWEVER AS IT OFTEN OCCURS THERE IS ONE FORGOTTEN POPULATION INCARCERATED LABOR FORCE. THE LABOR IS ALL THIS CALIFORNIA WITH DOCUMENTATION OF THIS PRACTICE DATING BACK TO EIGHTEEN FIFTY ONE. EVEN TODAY CALIFORNIA RELIES HEAVILY ON PRISON LABOR A PAYS INCARCERATED WORKERS UNFAIRLY AND I'M JUST WAGES. ALTHOUGH THE PRICE OF GOODS BEING SOLD TO OUR INCARCERATED POPULATION CONTINUES TO RISE THEIR WAGES HAVE NOT BEEN INCREASED SINCE THE EARLY NINETEEN NINETIES. INSIDE PRISONS CANTEEN GOODS ARE MARKED UP AT 65% OF THE RETAIL PRICE. IN ORDER TO BUY A BASIC BAR OF SOAP. WHICH COST AROUND TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY FIVE CENTS IN PRISON SOME INCARCERATED WORKERS WOULD HAVE TO WORK OVER FIFTY SIX HOURS. RAISING WAGES FOR THE INCARCERATED WORKFORCE WOULD REDUCE RECIDIVISM AND LESSEN THE BURDEN ON CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. IN NINETEEN NINETY VOTERS PASSED PROP ONE THIRTY NINE A STATUS IN THE JOINT VENTURE PROGRAM WHICH REQUIRED THE WAGES FOR INCARCERATED WORKERS WORKING UNDER THE JOINT VENTURE PROGRAM TO BE COMPENSATED. TO THE WEIGHT AS COMPATIBLE WAGES COME COMPARED TO THE WAGES OF NOT INCARCERATED PEOPLE WORKING DOING SIMILAR WORK. AS A RESULT PEOPLE WORKING UNDER THIS FREE UNDER THE JOINT VENTURE PROGRAM ARE PAID AT LEAST MINIMUM WAGE. THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN A PART OF THIS PROGRAM HAVE A NEWS AND PERCENT RECIDIVISM RATE COMPARED TO CALIFORNIA'S 55% FOR THEM FURTHERMORE THE ELLA BAKER CENTER FOR HUMAN RIGHTS REPORTS. THAT NEARLY 65% OF FAMILIES BECOME UNABLE TO PAY FOR THEIR VERY BASIC NEEDS WHEN I HOUSEHOLD MEMBER GOES TO PRISON. RAISING CHILDREN. NOT ONLY ARE PEOPLE UNABLE TO PROVIDE MEANINGFUL FINANCIAL SUPPORT WHILE INCARCERATED DUE TO THE CURRENTLY LOW WAGES- THE AVERAGE INCARCERATED PARENTS CAN- THIRTY SIX THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN CHILD SUPPORT. AND MANY HAVE TO ASK FAMILY FOR MONEY. TO COVER BASIC FOOD HEALTH AND DAILY NEEDS. THE MEAGER EARNINGS FROM PRISON WORK ASSIGNMENTS CAN BE ESSENTIAL TO A PERSON SUCCESS AND EVEN SURVIVAL. WHEN THEY RETURNED TO THEIR COMMUNITY BY PROVIDING THE OPPORTUNITY FOR INCARCERATED WORKERS TO EARN THEIR FAIR OR UNFAIR UNJUST WAGES INCARCERATED PEOPLE WOULD BE ABLE TO AFFORD. BASIC FOOD HYGIENE PRODUCTS PURCHASED QUARTERLY PACKAGES STAY IN COMMUNICATION WITH THEIR FAMILY AND PURCHASE EDUCATIONAL MATERIALS. THE FIVE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE MAKES IT FEASIBLE TO GET TO A POINT WHERE INCARCERATED WORKERS WOULD BE ABLE TO PAY OFF LARGE AMOUNTS OF THE RESTITUTION. WHILE HAVING THE OPPORTUNITY TO MEET THE FINANCIAL RESPONSIBILITY TO THEIR PLEASE. REPAIR FOR SUCCESSFULREENTRY THEREBY PROMOTING PUBLIC SAFETY FOR THESE REASONS I PUT ASK THAT YOU PLEASE SUPPORT SB THIRTY SEVENTY ONE THANK YOU.

THANK YOU. THANK YOU I HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM MODERATOR. HE WHICH IS YOUR CHECK OKAY. OKAY SO- THANK YOU TO ALL OUR SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION WITNESSES WILL NOW BRING THE DISCUSSION BACK TO OUR MEMBERS TO ANY MEMBERS HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. AND. YEAH THAT YOU KNOW FAMILY MEMBERS FRIENDS AND SOMETIMES EVEN ATTORNEYS END UP SUBSIDIZING INCARCERATED PEOPLE'S TIME IN PRISON- AND SO IT ACTUALLY COSTS IMPRISONED AND IT COSTS THEIR VILLAGE- IT COSTS ARE VILLAGE FOR SOMEONE TO BE IN PRISON AND SO I YOU KNOW I PEOPLE I HAD THIS WITH A CA THREE WHY DO YOU WANNA YOU KNOW SEE PEOPLE AS HUMANS- THAT DESERVE TO MAKE SOME SORT OF DIGNIFIED WAGE. AND THE COST OF BEING INCARCERATED IS INCREDIBLY EXPENSIVE. AND WE DON'T REALLY TALK ABOUT THAT AND SO I AM ACTUALLY APPLAUDING THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD SO THAT WE CAN HAVE DISCUSSIONS ABOUT. HOW HARD PEOPLE WORK IN PRISON AND NOW MEAGER THEIR WAGES ARE- AND IF THERE'S A WAY TO TRUST ACCOUNT SO THAT THINGS CAN BE DEPOSITED FOR THEM WHEN THEY GET OUT. YOU KNOW WE SHOULD BE THINKING CREATE ABOUT BEING HOW TO HELP FOLKS WITH FINANCIAL LITERACY PLANNING AND THEN HOW TO HELP THEM WHEN THEY GET OUT- BECAUSE THAT'S THE CYCLE OF REHABILITATION RATHER THAN ASKING FOLKS WHEN THEY LEAVE TO BE PERFECT TO MIGHT NOT MAKE ANY MISTAKES AND TO DO THIS WITH ABSOLUTELY NOTHING. YOU KNOW IN THEIR BANK ACCOUNTS SO. NUMBER THANK YOU SENATOR COMMA TO HAVE ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS THEIR SKINNER. YES THANK YOU THIS IS. THIS IS VERY NEEDED AND WHILE IT WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE A COST AS WAS POINTED OUT IN THE TESTIMONY. WE. WHAT WE ARE OW PAYING THOSE IN OUR PRISONS THAT WHO HAVE JOBS HARDLY EVEN COVERS WHAT WE THEN CHARGE THEM FOR THAT WHICH IS IN THE COMMISSARY OR FOR EVEN NET RIGHT NOW. WE ARE DURING THE PANDEMIC WE REDUCE THE COST TO MAKE ALMOST NO COST FOUR PHONE CALLS IN FACT BUT WHEN WE HAVE NOT. BE THE EVEN THE ABILITY TO CALL YOUR FAMILY. HAS BEEN EXTRAORDINARILY EXPENSIVE SO. IT'S WE'VE GOT THAT SITUATION AND AT THE SAME TIME. THOSE WHO ARE INCARCERATED ARE NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES AND IN MANY CASES THEIR FAMILIES ARE THEN NEEDING TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE STATE. AND SO. OR THEY COME OUT OF PRISON WITH VERY HIGH DEATHS AND ALREADY LIMITED ABILITY TO GET OUT OF EMPLOYMENT WHICH JUST CONTINUES THE CYCLE OF NOT ONLY POVERTY FOR THE INDIVIDUAL BUT FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO. IS NOT A SMART SYSTEM IT DOESN'T LAND LIKE SO MANY THINGS WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING. IN ON THE BILL'S IS IT DOESN'T LEND TO PUBLIC SAFETY BECAUSE IF YOUR FAMILY IS NOT SUPPORTED THEN THEY'RE PUT IN DESPERATE STRAITS WHEN YOU RETURN IF YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO GET. A GOOD JOB THEN YOU'RE PUT REAL QUALITY. JOB TRAINING IN BEING EMPLOYED WHILE YOU'RE IN THE FIRST RATED BENEFIT ALL US. WE ALSO PROVE THE GOODS THAT ARE MADE THERE. AND WILL BENEFIT THE INDIVIDUAL. AND OF COURSE THEIR FAMILIES SO I REALLY APPRECIATE. OUR CHAIR BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD. I REALIZE IT'S GOING TO HAVE IT IF WE ACTUALLY DO THIS IT WILL HAVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS BUT IT'S ABOUT TIME TO DO IT. YEAH. THANK YOU SENATOR SKINNER- ANYWHERE ELSE. I JUST LIKE TO HAVE JUST BASICALLY STATE THAT- FOR THE RECORD I BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD BE WORKING AND I I'M NOT SURE HOW THIS INCENTIVIZES PEOPLE TO WANT TO WORK OTHER IN COURT. RATHER HAVE SO I'M ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN EDUCATION- OR WORKING- TO BE MOTIVATED INCENTIVIZE TO ACTUALLY WORK AND HAVE SOMEONE SITTING IDLY IN THIS AND SO- FOR THOSE MEASURES I WILL BE SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY AND- DO WE HAVE A MOTION.
