00:06:05.732 --> 00:06:06.966
STRIKERS DUE TO RECENT

00:06:07.033 --> 00:06:08.234
LITIGATION.

00:06:08.301 --> 00:06:09.702
ALSO ONE MAY I ASK WHAT WHITE

00:06:09.769 --> 00:06:10.670
WHY YOU HAVEN'T AUGMENT THE

00:06:10.737 --> 00:06:11.738
CREDIT PIECE BECAUSE WHAT WE

00:06:11.804 --> 00:06:12.872
FOUND IS SINCE WE FIRST

00:06:12.939 --> 00:06:14.507
IMPLEMENTED AS ANYTHING NEW THAT

00:06:14.574 --> 00:06:15.441
YOU.

00:06:15.508 --> 00:06:17.210
IMPLEMENT WHAT WERE FOUND IS

00:06:17.276 --> 00:06:18.911
THAT -- THE

00:06:18.978 --> 00:06:20.513
INMATES WHOSE DATES CHANGE

00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:22.448
BECAUSE THEY ARE DETERMINED HE

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:25.017
SENTENCED ABOUT 46% WERE ONLY

00:06:25.084 --> 00:06:26.352
ABLE TO EARN THOSE CREDITS

00:06:26.419 --> 00:06:28.688
BECAUSE THE REMAINING INMATES IN

00:06:28.755 --> 00:06:30.189
THOSE PROGRAMS WERE LIFERS.

00:06:30.256 --> 00:06:31.624
AND THOSE DATES REALLY DIDN'T

00:06:31.691 --> 00:06:33.359
IMPACT LIFE FOR DATES SO WILL

00:06:33.426 --> 00:06:34.026
YOU COULD CALCULATE RELEASE

00:06:34.093 --> 00:06:34.861
STATES.

00:06:34.927 --> 00:06:36.529
A DECISION WAS MADE EARLY ON AND

00:06:36.596 --> 00:06:37.196
I BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT

00:06:37.263 --> 00:06:38.631
DECISION AND I THINK IT'S A GOOD

00:06:38.698 --> 00:06:40.366
DECISION NOW NOT TO REMOVE THESE

00:06:40.433 --> 00:06:41.801
LIFERS BECAUSE LIFERS NEED THEM.

00:06:41.868 --> 00:06:43.402
LIFERS ARE STABLE POPULATION IN

00:06:43.469 --> 00:06:44.470
PRISON --

00:06:44.537 --> 00:06:45.738
THEY ALSO --

00:06:45.805 --> 00:06:46.906
INCENTIVIZE HOPE TO THE OTHER

00:06:46.973 --> 00:06:47.974
INMATES ENCOURAGING TO

00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:49.876
PARTICIPATE SO BECAUSE OF THAT

00:06:49.942 --> 00:06:51.644
WE'RE LOOKING TO INCREASE THE

00:06:51.711 --> 00:06:53.479
CREDITS ELIGIBLE --

00:06:53.546 --> 00:06:54.914
FOR PARTICIPATION IN THESE

00:06:54.981 --> 00:06:58.151
REHABILITATE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS

00:06:58.217 --> 00:06:59.685
AND MILESTONE PROGRAMS.

00:06:59.752 --> 00:07:00.620
I DO TAKE CARD IN THE MIDDLE OF

00:07:00.686 --> 00:07:01.387
ALL THESE VAST CHANGES AND

00:07:01.454 --> 00:07:02.989
CORRECTIONS THAT RECIDIVISM HAS

00:07:03.055 --> 00:07:04.490
STAYED STABLE.

00:07:04.557 --> 00:07:06.359
EVEN AS THE PRISON POPULATION IS

00:07:06.425 --> 00:07:07.727
LARGER AND THE PERCENTAGE OF

00:07:07.794 --> 00:07:09.962
SERIOUS AND VIOLENT OFFENDERS IN

00:07:10.029 --> 00:07:10.196
PRISON.

00:07:10.263 --> 00:07:11.264
AS INCREASED.

00:07:11.330 --> 00:07:12.165
OFFENDERS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO EARN

00:07:12.231 --> 00:07:15.134
THEIR FREE SIX MONTHS OR EVEN

00:07:15.201 --> 00:07:16.335
YEARS --

00:07:16.402 --> 00:07:18.137
THAN THE EARLIER WHAT HAPPENED

00:07:18.204 --> 00:07:18.738
FOR ME AGAIN I KEEP ON USING

00:07:18.805 --> 00:07:19.972
THIS TERM.

00:07:20.039 --> 00:07:20.973
THERE IS HOPE THAT THE INMATES

00:07:21.040 --> 00:07:22.708
SEE THAT THEIR PARTICIPATION IN

00:07:22.775 --> 00:07:24.210
THESE PROGRAMS DO WORK.

00:07:24.277 --> 00:07:25.178
HOWEVER WE ARE CONSTANTLY

00:07:25.244 --> 00:07:26.979
WORKING TO IMPROVE THIS RATE AND

00:07:27.046 --> 00:07:28.548
ALLOW MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:07:28.614 --> 00:07:29.649
OFFENDERS.

00:07:29.715 --> 00:07:31.017
OR OFFICER RESEARCH IS CONDUCTED

00:07:31.083 --> 00:07:32.618
AN ASSESSMENT ON THE IMPACT OF

00:07:32.685 --> 00:07:34.187
SPECIFIC PROGRAMS AND WHAT THEY

00:07:34.253 --> 00:07:35.388
DISCOVERED THAT.

00:07:35.454 --> 00:07:36.522
THE RECIDIVISM RATE FOR

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:37.623
FRAWLEY'S WITH THE TREATMENT

00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:38.958
NEED WHO ARE RECEIVED IMPRISONED

00:07:39.025 --> 00:07:40.860
SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROGRAM WAS

00:07:40.927 --> 00:07:42.295
THIRTY EIGHT POINT 5%.

00:07:42.361 --> 00:07:43.930
COMPARED TO THE FORTY ONE POINT

00:07:43.996 --> 00:07:45.331
FOUR WHO DID NOT RECEIVE THIS

00:07:45.398 --> 00:07:46.966
TREATMENT --

00:07:47.033 --> 00:07:48.067
THE ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE FOR

00:07:48.134 --> 00:07:50.203
OFFENDERS WHO EARNED EDUCATION

00:07:50.269 --> 00:07:51.838
MERIT CREDITS THESE OF THE

00:07:51.904 --> 00:07:54.373
EDUCATION AND COLLEGE --

00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:56.909
THERE A THE ONE YOUR CONVICTION

00:07:56.976 --> 00:07:58.978
REFER THEM WAS 9%.

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:01.781
IN TWO THOUSAND ON 9% IN TWO

00:08:01.848 --> 00:08:02.915
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALTHOUGH

00:08:02.982 --> 00:08:04.083
THESE AREN'T IT'S NOT APPLE TO

00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.651
APPLE COMPARISON WE HAVE SEEN

00:08:05.718 --> 00:08:06.953
THE DIFFERENCE IN THE CHANGES

00:08:07.019 --> 00:08:07.753
BASED ON THESE --

00:08:07.820 --> 00:08:10.056
RECIDIVISM NUMBERS BASED ON

00:08:10.122 --> 00:08:13.326
PARTICIPATION IN THESE CREDITS --

00:08:13.392 --> 00:08:13.893
WE ALSO TOOK A LOOK AT NINE

00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:17.530
HUNDRED AND REQUIREMENTS WE HAVE

00:08:17.597 --> 00:08:18.898
HAD A ONE YOUR CONVICTION RATE

00:08:18.965 --> 00:08:21.400
OF NINE POINT FIVE THE THESE ARE

00:08:21.467 --> 00:08:22.802
ENCOURAGING NUMBERS.

00:08:22.869 --> 00:08:24.270
WE SEE IN MOST PARTICIPATING WE

00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:25.605
SEE THEM CHANGING AND FOR US

00:08:25.671 --> 00:08:27.406
THAT'S A GOOD THING. FOR THE

00:08:27.473 --> 00:08:28.574
MORE CITIES YOUR POPULATION

00:08:28.641 --> 00:08:30.009
PROJECTIONS PREDICT THAT THE

00:08:30.076 --> 00:08:31.510
ADULT POPULATION.

00:08:31.577 --> 00:08:34.747
IS. TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE BUT

00:08:34.814 --> 00:08:35.848
NOT AT THE RATE WE INITIALLY

00:08:35.915 --> 00:08:36.983
EXPECTED --

00:08:37.049 --> 00:08:39.051
THE FALL OF TWENTY TWO THOUSAND

00:08:39.118 --> 00:08:40.019
EIGHTEEN PROJECTIONS ARE BASED

00:08:40.086 --> 00:08:42.221
ON A 1% HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED

00:08:42.288 --> 00:08:44.357
IN SPRING TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN

00:08:44.423 --> 00:08:46.459
REPORT REPORT MAINLY BECAUSE OF

00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:48.494
THE FIFTY OF THE PROFIT THE

00:08:48.561 --> 00:08:50.096
SEVEN OF ENHANCEMENT EARNING

00:08:50.162 --> 00:08:51.964
CREDITS I DESCRIBED EARLIER WITH

00:08:52.031 --> 00:08:53.599
THE RACKS IN THE MILESTONES.

00:08:53.666 --> 00:08:55.067
THAT SKEWED THAT'S WOULD BUMP

00:08:55.134 --> 00:08:58.037
THE NUMBER UP BY 1% AND 1% WITH

00:08:58.104 --> 00:08:59.805
THESE NUMBERS IS AN INCREASE OF

00:08:59.872 --> 00:09:03.409
BILLS YOU SOME PROJECTIONS.

00:09:03.476 --> 00:09:04.677
DON'T HAVE ACHIEVEMENT CREDITS.

00:09:04.744 --> 00:09:06.579
IN POINT IN TIME DATA LIFERS

00:09:06.646 --> 00:09:09.682
EARNED ONE THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED

00:09:09.749 --> 00:09:10.716
THIRTY ONE RACK CREDITS.

00:09:10.783 --> 00:09:13.519
AND THE NON LIFERS AREN'T

00:09:13.586 --> 00:09:14.120
SIXTEEN THOUSAND SEVEN HUNDRED

00:09:14.186 --> 00:09:14.820
EIGHTY FIVE THAT 44% THOSE OF

00:09:14.887 --> 00:09:16.188
THE NUMBERS EXPLAINED EARLY ON

00:09:16.255 --> 00:09:17.223
WHY IT WAS OFF.

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:19.592
THAT'S WHY WE AMENDED THESE --

00:09:19.659 --> 00:09:21.560
REGULATIONS --

00:09:21.627 --> 00:09:22.228
BUT I'D BE REMISS IF I DID TAKE

00:09:22.295 --> 00:09:23.930
A MOMENT TO REMIND THE COMMITTEE

00:09:23.996 --> 00:09:25.531
THAT WE ARE STILL SUBJECT TO THE

00:09:25.598 --> 00:09:27.433
THREE JUDGE PANEL ONE THIRTY

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.701
SEVEN POINT FIVE NUMBER --

00:09:28.768 --> 00:09:30.136
THATPOPCAP WE'VE BEEN UNDER

00:09:30.202 --> 00:09:32.405
SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN BUT

00:09:32.471 --> 00:09:32.939
WE MUST --

00:09:33.005 --> 00:09:35.241
STILL MONITOR THE POPULATION

00:09:35.308 --> 00:09:37.810
TODAY WE ARE AT THREE THOUSAND

00:09:37.877 --> 00:09:38.411
THREE HUNDRED AND FORTY TO BE

00:09:38.477 --> 00:09:40.646
LOW THE POP CAP NUMBER BUT I

00:09:40.713 --> 00:09:42.248
ALSO NEED TO REMIND THAT WE ARE

00:09:42.315 --> 00:09:44.750
STILL WITH ABOUT FOURTEEN

00:09:44.817 --> 00:09:46.285
HUNDRED INMATES STILL IN ARIZONA --

00:09:46.352 --> 00:09:47.820
WE THE GOAL TO HAVE THOSE

00:09:47.887 --> 00:09:49.255
INMATES BACK BY JUNE THIRTIETH

00:09:49.322 --> 00:09:50.756
OF THIS YEAR.

00:09:50.823 --> 00:09:53.392
WE ARE BRINGING BACK BETWEEN --

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:54.427
I THINK THE LAST TIME I SAW

00:09:54.493 --> 00:09:56.395
BETWEEN SEVENTY NINE AND A

00:09:56.462 --> 00:09:57.697
HUNDRED AND THIRTEEN INMATES A

00:09:57.763 --> 00:09:58.798
WEEK.

00:09:58.864 --> 00:10:00.066
AND WE ARE ON TRACK TO HAVE THEM

00:10:00.132 --> 00:10:01.500
BACK AND THAT'S THE GOAL.

00:10:01.567 --> 00:10:02.535
THE REASON WE DO NOT KEEP THE

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:04.337
ORIGINAL TIME FRIENDS BECAUSE OF

00:10:04.403 --> 00:10:06.639
SOME OF THE BOB POP PROJECTIONS

00:10:06.706 --> 00:10:08.307
THAT I EXPLAINED EARLIER.

00:10:08.374 --> 00:10:09.308
AND THAT THE THOUGHT THAT WE

00:10:09.375 --> 00:10:10.476
WERE CONTINUE TO BRING THE BACK

00:10:10.543 --> 00:10:11.777
SOONER WE WOULD HAVE SEVERELY

00:10:11.844 --> 00:10:13.346
IMPACTED THE THREE JUDGE PANEL

00:10:13.412 --> 00:10:14.480
NUMBER WE WOULD HAVE BEEN.

00:10:14.547 --> 00:10:16.215
VERY CLOSE TO BEING OVER AND

00:10:16.282 --> 00:10:17.850
THAT'S NOT WHAT WE WANTED TO BE.

00:10:17.917 --> 00:10:19.885
A SEEMS LIKE A LOT --

00:10:19.952 --> 00:10:21.454
THAT THE CUSHION THAT WE HAVE

00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:23.189
RIGHT NOW --

00:10:23.255 --> 00:10:24.957
BUT I DO NEED TO REMIND THAT --

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.292
NO THE QUESTION IS IN IS IS

00:10:26.359 --> 00:10:27.860
ROBUST AS I WE THAT WE WOULD

00:10:27.927 --> 00:10:29.762
LIKE BECAUSE WHAT WE RECOGNIZE

00:10:29.829 --> 00:10:31.097
AS ONE LEAKY ROOF ONE BAD COURT

00:10:31.163 --> 00:10:32.231
RULING.

00:10:32.298 --> 00:10:34.400
CHANGES IN SENTENCING ANYTHING

00:10:34.467 --> 00:10:35.835
COULD CHANGE HOW INMATES ARE

00:10:35.901 --> 00:10:37.403
RECEIVED IN THE INTO THE SYSTEM

00:10:37.470 --> 00:10:38.704
AND WE NEED TO BE COUNSELED

00:10:38.771 --> 00:10:41.907
MINDFUL OF THAT --

00:10:41.974 --> 00:10:44.343
I RAISE THAT POINT BECAUSE

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:46.312
EXCEEDS THE POPPED UP WE WILL BE

00:10:46.379 --> 00:10:47.446
UNDER THE COURT --

00:10:47.513 --> 00:10:49.348
THE COURT MONITOR --

00:10:49.415 --> 00:10:50.416
BUT I DENIED.

00:10:50.483 --> 00:10:51.617
I'LL JUST SAY THAT BUT WE DO

00:10:51.684 --> 00:10:53.352
HAVE SOME GOOD NEWS SO THE GOOD

00:10:53.419 --> 00:10:54.620
NEWS IS A DECADE AGO ONLY A

00:10:54.687 --> 00:10:56.822
QUARTER OF OUR INMATE.

00:10:56.889 --> 00:10:57.923
WAS HOUSE ON LEVEL TWO

00:10:57.990 --> 00:10:59.925
FACILITIES WHICH ARE LOWER LEVEL

00:10:59.992 --> 00:11:01.327
THERE'S MORE PROGRAMMING FOR

00:11:01.394 --> 00:11:03.095
THOSE INMATES THERE'S A MORE

00:11:03.162 --> 00:11:04.497
ACCESS MORE OPENNESS.

00:11:04.563 --> 00:11:06.866
BUT AS OF TODAY WE HAVE A OVER A

00:11:06.932 --> 00:11:09.702
THIRD 36% OF OUR POPULATION.

00:11:09.769 --> 00:11:10.403
IS IN THESE LOWER LEVEL

00:11:10.469 --> 00:11:11.771
FACILITIES THAT'S IMPORTANT

00:11:11.837 --> 00:11:14.073
BECAUSE WHAT WE HAVE IS A

00:11:14.140 --> 00:11:15.808
DIFFERENT POPULATION THAN WE HAD.

00:11:15.875 --> 00:11:17.143
WE HAVE A MORE SERIOUS MORE

00:11:17.209 --> 00:11:18.544
VIOLENT POPULATION THAT COME IN

00:11:18.611 --> 00:11:20.046
BUT WE RECOGNIZE THAT AN

00:11:20.112 --> 00:11:21.213
INDIVIDUAL SHOULDN'T JUST BE

00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:22.615
HOUSE BASED ON THE CRIME THEY

00:11:22.681 --> 00:11:23.582
COMMITTED.

00:11:23.649 --> 00:11:24.650
IT'S A HOLISTIC APPROACH IN OUR

00:11:24.717 --> 00:11:26.218
HOUSING INMATES TO GET THEM AT

00:11:26.285 --> 00:11:27.653
THE LOWEST LEVEL.

00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:30.122
POSSIBLE SO WE CAN REACH THE

00:11:30.189 --> 00:11:31.724
REHABILITATIVE NEED.

00:11:31.791 --> 00:11:32.658
TOM I KNOW I'VE BEEN IN FRONT OF

00:11:32.725 --> 00:11:33.826
THE COMMITTEES LIKE THIS TO TALK

00:11:33.893 --> 00:11:35.828
ABOUT A SHOE POPULATIONS THERE

00:11:35.895 --> 00:11:37.163
WAS A TIME WHEN WE'RE POPULATION.

00:11:37.229 --> 00:11:39.632
WAS ABOUT FOUR THOUSAND NOW THAT

00:11:39.698 --> 00:11:40.833
NUMBERS UNDER.

00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:42.401
EIGHT HUNDRED AND SO THAT IS A

00:11:42.468 --> 00:11:43.903
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR SYSTEM.

00:11:43.969 --> 00:11:45.438
THERE ARE ADMINISTRATIVE

00:11:45.504 --> 00:11:47.573
SEGREGATION UNITS --

00:11:47.640 --> 00:11:51.010
THAT WE'RE AT ONE POINT AT ABOUT.

00:11:51.077 --> 00:11:51.544
EIGHT ONE THOUSAND UNKNOWN

00:11:51.610 --> 00:11:52.278
NUMBERS ARE TRENDING IN THE

00:11:52.344 --> 00:11:54.213
RIGHT DIRECTION AND I THINK IT'S

00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.081
JUST THE WAY WE HAVE BEEN

00:11:55.147 --> 00:11:56.549

00:12:06.926 --> 00:12:09.495

A COUPLE OF OTHER HOUSING HAVE A

00:12:11.097 --> 00:12:12.965
POINT I WANT TO MAKE THE

00:12:13.032 --> 00:12:15.201
POPULATION IS THAT --

00:12:15.267 --> 00:12:16.735
MOSER'S INVITES OFFENDER BUT I

IN LOS ANGELES AND BEAUMONT --

00:13:26.639 --> 00:13:27.473
I DO WANT TO SAY THAT --

00:13:27.540 --> 00:13:30.442

CUSTODY PLACEMENTS.

00:13:32.945 --> 00:13:35.080
OF THE REASON THAT IT'S REALLY

00:13:35.147 --> 00:13:37.349
SO LOW IS BECAUSE THE READ THE

00:13:37.416 --> 00:13:39.018
REALITY IS IS THAT HOUSING PLANS

00:13:39.084 --> 00:13:40.352
FOR FEMALE OFFENDERS ARE QUITE

00:13:40.419 --> 00:13:41.554
DIFFERENT THAN THEY ARE FOR THE

00:13:41.620 --> 00:13:42.588
MALE OFFENDERS WHAT.

00:13:42.655 --> 00:13:45.391
SADLY WHAT WE FIND IS THAT --

WE ARE --

00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.669
APPROVING THE CORRECT WOMEN TO

00:13:56.735 --> 00:13:57.670
BE IN THESE ALTERNATE CUSTODY

00:13:57.736 --> 00:13:59.271
PLACE BEEN HOME SO THAT NUMBER

00:13:59.338 --> 00:14:00.439
IS ASSIGNED TO ME ALSO BUT IT

00:14:00.506 --> 00:14:02.007
ALSO CONSISTENT WITH NATIONAL

00:14:09.715 --> 00:14:10.349
RIGHT THING.

00:14:10.416 --> 00:14:13.219
ON WE HAVE --

00:14:13.285 --> 00:14:16.288

INSTITUTIONS.

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:21.060
AND AT A MUCH MORE BASIC LEVEL

00:14:21.126 --> 00:14:22.194
WHAT WE'RE FINDING IS THAT WE

00:14:22.261 --> 00:14:24.863
HAVE TO ADDRESS THE LITERACY OF

00:14:24.930 --> 00:14:25.898

POINT NO?

38% OF OUR POPULATION.

00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:36.775
ONLY 30% OF OUR POPULATION HAVE

SEPT COMMITTEE PROCESS IF LA --

00:18:44.423 --> 00:18:48.527

00:18:54.466 --> 00:18:55.834
THAT POPULATION REDUCTION.

00:18:55.901 --> 00:18:57.903
ON WE WOULD APPRECIATE IT I KNOW

00:18:57.970 --> 00:18:59.771
THERE IS MUCH IN THE REPORT TO

PRESENTED TO US ALREADY FOR

00:19:01.306 --> 00:19:03.108
EXAMPLE AROUND FIFTY SEVEN BUT

00:19:03.175 --> 00:19:04.476
IF THERE ARE.

IN ON THAT WOULD BE APPRECIATED.

00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:17.956
ON ALL RIGHT SO.

00:19:18.023 --> 00:19:20.125
I I WOULD ASK A FEW QUESTIONS

00:19:20.192 --> 00:19:22.294
AND THEN I HAVE TO CALL ON MY

00:19:22.361 --> 00:19:22.594
COLLEAGUES.

00:19:22.661 --> 00:19:27.566
ON ONE ONE QUESTION I HAVE IS

00:19:27.633 --> 00:19:29.101
AROUND ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY.

00:19:29.167 --> 00:19:31.870
AND THAT IS ONE MECHANISM FOR US

00:19:31.937 --> 00:19:33.772
TO BRING POPULATION DOWN.

00:19:33.839 --> 00:19:35.641
AND GIVEN THAT OUR WOMEN'S

00:19:35.707 --> 00:19:37.175
FACILITY IS ONE OF THE MOST

00:19:37.242 --> 00:19:39.044
SERIOUSLY OVERCROWDED IT'S AT A

00:19:39.111 --> 00:19:40.946
HUNDRED AND 40% IT'S POPULATION

00:19:41.013 --> 00:19:43.282
TO HEAR THAT WE ARE ONLY IN

00:19:43.348 --> 00:19:44.750
SIXTEEN WOMEN AN ALTERNATIVE

00:19:44.816 --> 00:19:44.983
CASSIE.

00:19:45.050 --> 00:19:46.184
I'M NOT PLEASED.

00:19:46.251 --> 00:19:48.420
AND TO HAVE THE CORRELATION BE

00:19:48.487 --> 00:19:49.087
WILL THAT.

00:19:49.154 --> 00:19:50.856

HOUSING THAT'S THAT'S A

00:19:52.624 --> 00:19:54.760
REINFORCED BY NATIONAL STUDY.

00:19:54.826 --> 00:19:57.162
I HAD DOESN'T HELP ME.

00:19:57.229 --> 00:19:58.664
SO -- WE

00:19:58.730 --> 00:20:00.699
HAVE PUT.

00:20:00.766 --> 00:20:02.034
WE HAVE.

00:20:02.100 --> 00:20:05.971
DIRECTED THIS AS A PRIORITY IN

00:20:06.038 --> 00:20:07.673
AN EMPHASIS [inaudible]

00:20:07.739 --> 00:20:10.375
TO PURSUE --

00:20:10.442 --> 00:20:11.410
MORE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

00:20:11.476 --> 00:20:12.744
ALTERNATIVE CUSTODY [inaudible]

00:20:12.811 --> 00:20:16.815
AND THE ANY OTHER COMMENTS YOU

00:20:16.882 --> 00:20:17.983
WANNA MAKE ABOUT THAT I'M I'M

00:20:18.050 --> 00:20:19.484
JUST AS CONCERNED AS YOU SENATOR

00:20:19.551 --> 00:20:20.786
I AM -- TO

00:20:20.852 --> 00:20:21.853
LOOK AT THE NUMBERS COMPARED TO

00:20:21.920 --> 00:20:23.722
WHAT WE HAVE IN THE MEN'S MAIL

00:20:23.789 --> 00:20:26.024
COMMUNITY REENTRY PROGRAMS.

00:20:26.091 --> 00:20:28.527
SIXTEEN IS IS NOT A GOOD NUMBER --

00:20:28.594 --> 00:20:30.395
AND ONE OF THE THINGS THAT I I

00:20:30.462 --> 00:20:31.830
WANT TO DO IS WORK WITH YOU I

00:20:31.897 --> 00:20:33.165
LOOK FORWARD.

00:20:33.231 --> 00:20:34.433
TO WORKING WITH YOU BUT ALSO

00:20:34.499 --> 00:20:38.303
HAVING A OUR PROCESS IF IT'S TOO

00:20:38.370 --> 00:20:39.838
STRINGENT IF THE THINGS THAT WE

00:20:39.905 --> 00:20:41.073
NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE

00:20:41.139 --> 00:20:43.408
pAND FEMALES.

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:44.810
AND WE NEED TO WORK WITH WORK

00:20:44.876 --> 00:20:46.111
WITH OUR PAROLE AND OUR AND OUR

00:20:46.178 --> 00:20:47.379
COUNTY PARTNERS EVEN IF.

00:20:47.446 --> 00:20:49.514
WE CAN DO THAT BUT I KNOW WE CAN

00:20:49.581 --> 00:20:51.049
BUT IT'S JUST IS CONCERNED I

00:20:51.116 --> 00:20:52.050
LOOK FOR TO WORKING WITH YOU ON

00:20:52.117 --> 00:20:53.018
IT MY TEAM.

00:20:53.085 --> 00:20:54.519
AS I WAS DEVELOPING MY TALKING

00:20:54.586 --> 00:20:56.321
POINTS THIS WAS ONE AREA THAT

00:20:56.388 --> 00:20:58.056
THEY ARE BACK DOING WORK ON

00:20:58.123 --> 00:21:00.258
BECAUSE THAT WAS TRULY A NUMBER

00:21:00.325 --> 00:21:02.260
THAT I'M NOT.

00:21:02.327 --> 00:21:05.297
I'M IN AND I RAISE THE ISSUE OF

00:21:05.364 --> 00:21:06.932
THE FACT THAT WE HAVE NOT YET

00:21:06.999 --> 00:21:08.634
BEEN ABLE TO MOVE ARE FOLKS WHO

00:21:08.700 --> 00:21:09.701
ARE OUT OF STATE.

00:21:09.768 --> 00:21:12.537
THAT GIVEN THAT WE HAVE

00:21:12.604 --> 00:21:12.838
[inaudible]

00:21:12.904 --> 00:21:14.740
EMPHASIZED REHABILITATION EVEN

00:21:14.806 --> 00:21:17.843
BEFORE THE PASSAGE OF PROP.

00:21:17.909 --> 00:21:19.911
FIFTY SEVEN AND WHILE WE EXPECT

00:21:19.978 --> 00:21:21.546
IN OUR CONTRACTS THAT WE HAVE

00:21:21.613 --> 00:21:23.882
THAT TYPE OF REQUIREMENT --

00:21:23.949 --> 00:21:25.751
EXPECTATION IN ARIZONA WE HAVE

00:21:25.817 --> 00:21:27.152
NO ABILITY TO REALLY MONNING WE

00:21:27.219 --> 00:21:29.354
HAVE NO REAL ABILITY TO KNOW

00:21:29.421 --> 00:21:30.722
THAT THEY ARE MEETING.

00:21:30.789 --> 00:21:32.357
THE ARE.

00:21:32.424 --> 00:21:33.759
THE OBJECTIVES WE HAVE WHICH IS

00:21:33.825 --> 00:21:35.627
I THINK ANOTHER REASON WHY.

00:21:35.694 --> 00:21:38.463
ON THERE IS GREAT DESIRE IN

00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:39.931
ADDITION MEETING OUR COURT

00:21:39.998 --> 00:21:42.367
MANDATED POPULATION CAP TO GET

00:21:42.434 --> 00:21:44.603
THOSE FOLKS OUT FROM OUT OF

00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:45.404
STATE.

00:21:45.470 --> 00:21:47.639
WHERE WE HAVE MORE ABILITY TO

00:21:47.706 --> 00:21:49.441
PROVIDE THE PROPER OVERSIGHT?

00:21:49.508 --> 00:21:51.343
I'M SO IN THAT SPIRIT I WANT TO

00:21:51.410 --> 00:21:54.846
ALSO ASK THE QUESTION OF OUR

00:21:54.913 --> 00:21:57.249
WITHIN.

00:21:57.315 --> 00:21:59.651
WITHIN OUR OWN REHABILITATIVE

00:21:59.718 --> 00:22:01.853
PROGRAMS AND WORK --

00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:03.121
COMMITTEE MEMBERS IN TWO WEEKS

00:22:03.188 --> 00:22:05.390
WE'RE GOING TO HAVE.

00:22:05.457 --> 00:22:09.661
AN AGENDA VARIES VERY --

00:22:09.728 --> 00:22:12.330
FOCUSED ON THAT GIVEN ESPECIALLY

00:22:12.397 --> 00:22:16.401
GIVEN THE AUDITOR'S REPORT AND

00:22:16.468 --> 00:22:19.004
OTHER THINGS --

00:22:19.071 --> 00:22:23.608
TO TO REALLY LOOK AT WHETHER ARE

00:22:23.675 --> 00:22:26.778
YES WHETHER OUR PROGRAMS ARE.

00:22:26.845 --> 00:22:30.682
ARE ADEQUATE WHETHER THEY ARE --

00:22:30.749 --> 00:22:32.851
ACCESSIBLE TO ALL THE INMATES

00:22:32.918 --> 00:22:34.653
THAT NEED THEM SO I WANT TO GO

00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.288
INTO GREAT DETAIL ABOUT THAT

00:22:36.354 --> 00:22:37.889
TODAY BUT I DO WANT TO ASK.

00:22:37.956 --> 00:22:40.292
THAT WHEN YOU DESCRIBE THAT WE

00:22:40.358 --> 00:22:41.927
HAVE -- OUR

00:22:41.993 --> 00:22:44.062
POPULATION IS GOING TO BE 1%

00:22:44.129 --> 00:22:46.732
HIGHER THAN WE WERE HOPING.

00:22:46.798 --> 00:22:49.000
THEN I THINK TO MYSELF WELL IF

00:22:49.067 --> 00:22:50.068
IT'S HIGHER THAN WE WERE

00:22:50.135 --> 00:22:51.837
PROJECTING.

00:22:51.903 --> 00:22:54.372
AND WE STILL HAVE YARDS THAT DO

00:22:54.439 --> 00:22:56.208
NOT HAVE.

00:22:56.274 --> 00:22:58.610
PROGRAMS THAT WOULD ALLOW

00:22:58.677 --> 00:23:00.912
INMATES TO BE ABLE.

00:23:00.979 --> 00:23:02.547
TO GET REHABILITATIVE CREDITS

00:23:02.614 --> 00:23:03.915
AND WHILE I COMPLETELY

00:23:03.982 --> 00:23:05.016
APPRECIATE.

00:23:05.083 --> 00:23:06.752
THAT WE SHOULD NOT EXCLUDE

00:23:06.818 --> 00:23:08.920
LIFERS FROM PROGRAMS WE SHOULD

00:23:08.987 --> 00:23:09.121
NOT.

00:23:09.187 --> 00:23:12.023
BUT KNOWING THAT WE HAVE THIS

00:23:12.090 --> 00:23:14.893
EMPHASIS IN KNOWING THAT WE HAVE

00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.495
GIVEN INMATES THE PROMISE OF

00:23:16.561 --> 00:23:18.530
BEING ABLE TO PARTICIPATE IN

00:23:18.597 --> 00:23:19.965
THESE PROGRAMS.

00:23:20.031 --> 00:23:22.100
AND AND YET YOU INDICATE THAT

00:23:22.167 --> 00:23:23.935
OUR POPULATIONS HIGHER.

00:23:24.002 --> 00:23:25.737
AND I THINK PART OF IT IS DUE TO

00:23:25.804 --> 00:23:27.339
THE FACT THAT WE DON'T HAVE

00:23:27.405 --> 00:23:28.907
THESE PROGRAMS SUCCESSFUL TO

00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:30.509
INMATES IN WITH THEY'RE NOT

00:23:30.575 --> 00:23:31.910
AVAILABLE IN ALL YARDS.

00:23:31.977 --> 00:23:34.045
WHAT ARE YOU DOING ABOUT IT?

00:23:34.112 --> 00:23:35.413
WHILE WORKING CLOSELY WITH THE

00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:36.848
DIVISION OF REHABILITATIVE

00:23:36.915 --> 00:23:39.851
PROGRAMS AND I AT I THINK ON THE

00:23:39.918 --> 00:23:41.653
CHEN.

00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:42.821
NO NOT TODAY INTO WHAT WORKING

00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:44.156
CLOSELY WITH THEM AND ONE OF THE

00:23:44.222 --> 00:23:45.891
WHAT WE ARE WORKING ON IS

00:23:45.957 --> 00:23:47.726
ENSURING THAT --

00:23:47.793 --> 00:23:49.961
V. SPACE THAT WE HAVE IN THE

00:23:50.028 --> 00:23:51.429
INSTITUTION IS BEING MAXIMIZE

00:23:51.496 --> 00:23:52.864
THAT WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND OUR

00:23:52.931 --> 00:23:55.066
TRADITIONAL CUSTODIAL MINDSETS

00:23:55.133 --> 00:23:56.935
ON WHAT WE CAN PUT INMATES IN

00:23:57.002 --> 00:23:58.236
PROGRAMS --

00:23:58.303 --> 00:23:59.671
BECAUSE A BOILS DOWN MEANT

00:23:59.738 --> 00:24:01.139
MAJORITY THE TIME SENATOR IS.

00:24:01.206 --> 00:24:04.009
TIME AND SPACE THIS LIMITED

00:24:04.075 --> 00:24:05.610
AMOUNT OF TIME IN A DAY TO WHERE

00:24:05.677 --> 00:24:06.878
WE CAN HAVE INMATES AND PROGRAM

00:24:06.945 --> 00:24:08.213

THE TRADITIONAL CUSTODIAL

00:24:24.596 --> 00:24:25.330
MINDSET.

00:24:25.397 --> 00:24:27.065
BECAUSE A LOT OF THE REGULATIONS

00:24:27.132 --> 00:24:28.533
THAT WE HAVE FOR SECURITY

00:24:28.600 --> 00:24:30.335
PURPOSES WERE WRITTEN WHAT WE

THE WARDENS MUST BE VERY

00:24:39.377 --> 00:24:41.446
CREATIVE ON WHERE WE ARE PUTTING

00:24:41.513 --> 00:24:42.581

CHALLENGES THAT ARE OUT THERE IT

00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.454
IS REALLY BEEN TE DISCUSSION

00:29:16.521 --> 00:29:17.322
HAS BEEN.

00:29:17.388 --> 00:29:19.324
NOT SO MUCH THE UTILIZATION OF

00:29:19.390 --> 00:29:21.126
SHOE PUTTING INMATES IN SHOE.

00:29:21.192 --> 00:29:24.295
BUT THE IMAGE THAT ARE RELEASED.

00:29:24.362 --> 00:29:27.165
ON TO OUR LEVEL FOR FACILITIES

00:29:27.232 --> 00:29:28.600
AND THAT --

00:29:28.666 --> 00:29:30.735
THOUGHT IS WE'RE PUTTING THEM ON

00:29:30.802 --> 00:29:32.837
THOSE FACILITIES --

00:29:32.904 --> 00:29:35.240
AND AT A HIGHER RATE AND WE'RE

00:29:35.306 --> 00:29:36.975
NOT AFFORDING THEM --

00:29:37.041 --> 00:29:37.742
THE A METHOD SAME AMOUNT OF

00:29:37.809 --> 00:29:39.177
PROGRAM IS THE REST OF THE

00:29:39.244 --> 00:29:40.145
INSTITUTIONS.

00:29:40.211 --> 00:29:41.713
AND THAT --

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:46.251
WE ARE THE INMATES THAT WERE

00:29:46.317 --> 00:29:47.619
INVOLVED IN THE LAWSUIT --

00:29:47.685 --> 00:29:49.888
THAT GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE --

00:29:49.954 --> 00:29:51.656
WE DON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH THEM --

00:29:51.723 --> 00:29:53.491
BUT I DO BELIEVE WE'RE STILL

00:29:53.558 --> 00:29:54.759
TRAINING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION

00:29:54.826 --> 00:29:56.227
IN THE UTILIZATION OF SHOE WE DO

00:29:56.294 --> 00:29:57.362
HAVE CHALLENGES.

00:29:57.428 --> 00:29:59.097
AND WHAT WE DO WITH THE

00:29:59.164 --> 00:30:00.698
POPULATION THAT WERE RELEASED.

00:30:00.765 --> 00:30:01.499
THAT THEY WARRANT YOU ONE YEAR

00:30:01.566 --> 00:30:03.768
ANOTHER HERE THE BELIEF IS THAT

00:30:03.835 --> 00:30:05.370
WE WE NEED TO BE PUSHING HIM TO

00:30:05.436 --> 00:30:06.738
THE LOWEST LEVELS OF POSSIBLE

00:30:06.804 --> 00:30:08.406
GET ENOUGH MORE REHABILITATION.

00:30:08.473 --> 00:30:10.241
AND I AGREE BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO

00:30:10.308 --> 00:30:12.544
BALANCE THE SECURITY NEEDS OF

00:30:12.610 --> 00:30:13.878
PUTTING AN INDIVIDUAL AT LOWER

00:30:13.945 --> 00:30:15.613

TO WANT TO FOREGO THAT LIFESTYLE.

00:30:20.318 --> 00:30:22.053
AND NOT --

00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.388
JUST WANTONLY PUTTING SOME OF

THESE RECENT SURE RELEASES ON

00:30:24.756 --> 00:30:26.891
THOSE YARDS THE FEAR IS.

00:30:26.958 --> 00:30:29.494
THAT IT COULD UPSET THE

00:30:29.561 --> 00:30:32.096
CHEMISTRY ON THOSE YOU BEGIN IN

00:30:32.163 --> 00:30:33.464

PRISONS UNDERSTAND.

00:30:43.474 --> 00:30:45.210

00:30:45.276 --> 00:30:46.411
LOWER LEVEL FACILITIES

00:30:46.477 --> 00:30:48.379

00:30:50.048 --> 00:30:51.349
THESE WE NEED --

00:30:51.416 --> 00:30:52.884
TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE INMATE MAY

00:30:52.951 --> 00:30:53.985
NOT HAVE RECEIVED.

00:30:54.052 --> 00:30:55.520
DISCIPLINARY HEARINGS FOR FIVE

00:37:32.617 --> 00:37:34.018
ISSUE WE GET TO IT IS A SERIES

00:37:34.085 --> 00:37:36.954
OF BILLS THAT PASSED THROUGH --

00:37:37.021 --> 00:37:38.255
LEGISLATION THAT DIDN'T HAVE AN

00:37:38.322 --> 00:37:40.391
APPROPRIATIONS WE HAVE A BUDGET

00:37:40.458 --> 00:37:42.126
CHANGE PROPOSAL.

00:37:42.193 --> 00:37:43.527
TO ADD THE STAFF --

00:37:43.594 --> 00:37:45.730
THAT WE NEED --

00:37:45.796 --> 00:37:47.331
TO TO ENACT THOSE BILLS I WOULD

00:37:47.398 --> 00:37:49.100
STATE TALKING ABOUT POSITIONS

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:52.403
JUST ON A ON A ON A BIGGER SCALE.

00:37:52.470 --> 00:37:55.106
OUR POSITIONS THA WE HAVE WE

00:37:55.172 --> 00:37:57.608
ARE ACTUALLY GOING DOWN IN THE

00:37:57.675 --> 00:37:59.744
GENERAL SECURITY CATEGORY.

00:37:59.810 --> 00:38:01.646
THE AS THE POPULATION GOES DOWN

00:38:01.712 --> 00:38:02.480
THE POSITION WITHOUT OTHER

00:38:02.546 --> 00:38:04.015
FACTORS WELL.

00:38:04.081 --> 00:38:05.016
A LOT OF THE POSITION GROWTH

00:38:05.082 --> 00:38:06.717
WERE EXPERIENCING.

00:38:06.784 --> 00:38:08.519
ARE IN THE CATEGORIES OF PAROLE

00:38:08.586 --> 00:38:09.153
WHERE WE'RE SEEING SORT OF THE

00:38:09.220 --> 00:38:10.421
OPPOSITE.

00:38:10.488 --> 00:38:12.223
OUR POPULATION IS GOING UP ALSO

00:38:12.289 --> 00:38:13.991
IN REHABILITATION PROGRAMS WE

00:38:14.058 --> 00:38:15.393
RAMP UP THOSE PROGRAMS TO TRY TO

00:38:15.459 --> 00:38:17.828
MEET THE NEEDS OF ALL THE

00:38:17.895 --> 00:38:20.097
INMATES ARE SEEKINGCREDITS.

00:38:20.164 --> 00:38:21.232
AND THEN OF COURSE --

00:38:21.298 --> 00:38:23.634
ARE WE DOING A LOT OF WORK TO

00:38:23.701 --> 00:38:25.603
TRY TO IMPLEMENT PROP SEVEN

00:38:25.670 --> 00:38:26.671
THROUGH OUR FOR BOARD OF PAROLE

00:38:26.737 --> 00:38:27.972
HEARINGS HAVING POSITION GROWTH

00:38:28.039 --> 00:38:28.572
THERE.

00:38:28.639 --> 00:38:29.974
I THINK THE FOURTH CATEGORY

00:38:30.041 --> 00:38:31.976
WOULD BE --

00:38:32.043 --> 00:38:34.445
ON THE MEDICAL SIDE WE HAVE IS

00:38:34.512 --> 00:38:35.680
THE RECEIVE ROLE.

00:38:35.746 --> 00:38:36.814
I SPEAK A LITTLE BIT ABOVE AS

00:38:36.881 --> 00:38:39.316
OUR POPULATION GETS MORE FRAIL.

00:38:39.383 --> 00:38:40.651
ELDERLY WE HAVE AN AGING

00:38:40.718 --> 00:38:41.752
POPULATION ARE MEDICAL NEEDS

00:38:41.819 --> 00:38:42.887
HAVE BEEN GROWING.

00:38:42.953 --> 00:38:44.789
BUT WE HAVE YOU KNOW OVERALL I

00:38:44.855 --> 00:38:49.226
THINK THE THE POSITIVE THING --

00:38:49.293 --> 00:38:51.295
LESS OF A NEED.

00:38:51.362 --> 00:38:53.064
TRADITIONAL CDC ARE GENERAL

00:38:53.130 --> 00:38:54.999
SECURITY POSITION.

00:38:55.066 --> 00:38:56.267
FIVE THEN I'LL ASK ONE LAST

00:38:56.333 --> 00:38:59.170
QUESTION AND IT'S ON PAGE. NINE

00:38:59.236 --> 00:39:00.204
HUNDRED NUMBER FOUR AND IT'S

00:39:00.271 --> 00:39:01.639
IT'S JUST A LITTLE PARAGRAPH AT

00:39:01.706 --> 00:39:02.807
THE END.

00:39:02.873 --> 00:39:04.041
AGE NINE OF OUR AT LEAST THE

00:39:04.108 --> 00:39:08.079

00:39:08.145 --> 00:39:11.148

OFFICE OF LEGAL AFFAIRS WEST.

00:39:17.121 --> 00:39:17.621
TWENTY SIX AND FOUR POINT BY

00:39:17.688 --> 00:39:18.322
POSITIONS [inaudible]

00:39:18.389 --> 00:39:19.924
RESPECTIVELY.

00:39:19.990 --> 00:39:21.425
TOTAL OF THIRTY POINT FIVE

00:39:21.492 --> 00:39:22.693
POSITIONS TO IMPLEMENT THE

00:39:22.760 --> 00:39:24.261

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:26.497
WITH A. B. FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

00:39:26.564 --> 00:39:28.199
AND I I FOR THE LIFE OF ME I

00:39:28.265 --> 00:39:30.735
DON'T SEE ANY ADDITIONAL DUTIES.

00:39:30.801 --> 00:39:32.403
FOR KEEPING PERSONNEL FILES SITE.

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.772
THERE'S A SO SO I'M I'M JUST WE

00:39:34.839 --> 00:39:35.806
WE HAVE.

00:39:35.873 --> 00:39:37.842
WE LET'S GET INTO THAT IN IF YOU

00:39:39.143 --> 00:39:41.345
OVERVIEW BECAUSE WHEN WE MIGHT.

00:39:41.412 --> 00:39:44.014
WHAT MIGHT NOT?

00:39:44.081 --> 00:39:45.015
TO A LEGITIMATE QUESTION MIGHT

00:39:45.082 --> 00:39:46.984
BE AND WHY AREN'T WE RE

00:39:47.051 --> 00:39:48.586
PURPOSING STAFF.

00:39:48.652 --> 00:39:50.921
VERSES NEW BUT WE'RE GONNA GET

00:39:50.988 --> 00:39:53.290
INTO MUCH DETAIL AROUND THESE

00:39:53.357 --> 00:39:55.326
PARTICULAR THINGS IN THAT ITEM

00:39:55.392 --> 00:39:57.428
TO BUT CERTAINLY.

00:39:57.495 --> 00:39:58.429
I CAN GIVE OVER VERSUS YOU YEAH

00:39:58.496 --> 00:39:59.163
FIRST OF ALL I'VE.

00:39:59.230 --> 00:40:00.631
I'VE ALREADY RECEIVED SOME SOME

00:40:00.698 --> 00:40:01.732
OF THE COMMUNICATIONS AND

00:40:01.799 --> 00:40:06.604
CONCERNS ON THAT AND I THINK

00:40:06.670 --> 00:40:10.174
Gí

00:40:10.241 --> 00:40:11.275
WITH CORRECTIONS WE TRAIN HIT A

00:40:11.342 --> 00:40:12.710
HOME RUN WE WANT TO JUST OVER

00:40:12.777 --> 00:40:15.212
CHIEF AND WE THEN HAVE CONCERN

00:40:15.279 --> 00:40:16.847
WITH THE RETROACTIVITY OF IT SO

00:40:16.914 --> 00:40:17.915
I THINK IN A REQUEST THAT.

00:40:17.982 --> 00:40:20.618
WE SEE HERE WE JUST WE WANT TO

00:40:20.684 --> 00:40:22.119
MAKE SURE WE ARE FULFILLING.

00:40:22.186 --> 00:40:23.921
THE THE INTENT AND NEED AND

00:40:23.988 --> 00:40:26.023
SPIRIT OF FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

00:40:26.090 --> 00:40:27.391
BUT THE TEAM WE'VE WE'VE BRIEFED

00:40:27.458 --> 00:40:28.492
AND YOU KNOW THE YOU CAN GET A

00:40:28.559 --> 00:40:29.560
MORE GRANULAR DISCUSSION WITH

00:40:29.627 --> 00:40:30.294
THEM.

00:40:30.361 --> 00:40:32.096
BUT I THINK IT COMES FROM NOT SO

00:40:32.163 --> 00:40:32.663
MUCH WE'RE TRYING TO EMPIRE

00:40:32.730 --> 00:40:33.731
BUILD.

00:40:33.798 --> 00:40:34.732
IT WAS TRYING TO MAKE SURE WE

00:40:34.799 --> 00:40:36.433
IMPLEMENT IT CORRECTLY A BECAUSE

00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:37.401
WE DO WANT TO BE THAT

00:40:37.468 --> 00:40:39.136
TRANSPARENCY WE DO WHAT WE ARE

00:40:39.203 --> 00:40:40.304
SO LARGE.

00:40:40.371 --> 00:40:41.939
AND WE HAVE SO MUCH OVERSIGHT

00:40:42.006 --> 00:40:43.707
AND RIGHTLY SO THE LARGE BUDGET

00:40:43.774 --> 00:40:45.376
WE HAVE A HUGE MISSION.

00:40:45.442 --> 00:40:47.044
AND WE DESERVE THAT OVERSIGHT SO

00:40:47.111 --> 00:40:47.745
I THINK --

00:40:47.812 --> 00:40:49.146
WHEN THE TEAM PRESENTS HERE BUT

00:40:49.213 --> 00:40:52.082
I THINK II HOPE THIS THE?

00:40:52.149 --> 00:40:53.851
NO THAT THE TASTE OF WHAT YOU

00:40:53.918 --> 00:40:54.518

GRAY HERE GOES CORRECTIONS AGAIN

00:40:55.986 --> 00:41:00.224
IT WAS CAME FROM A SPIRIT OF

00:41:00.291 --> 00:41:00.858
TRYING TO OVER ACHIEVE IN TRYING

00:41:00.925 --> 00:41:02.326
TO DO IT RIGHT.

00:41:02.393 --> 00:41:03.427
THOUGH MAYBE I SHOULD HAVE SAID

00:41:03.494 --> 00:41:05.563
LIMITED TERM POSITION MAKE MAYBE

00:41:05.629 --> 00:41:06.197
I MEAN WE TAKE A LOOK AT WHAT'S

00:41:06.263 --> 00:41:07.198
EACH BE DEAD WITHIN THAT.

00:41:07.264 --> 00:41:08.465
SO WE ARE EXAMINING THAT AND

00:41:08.532 --> 00:41:09.767
THEN I'M SURE THE TEAM WILL IT

00:41:09.834 --> 00:41:11.468
TAKE YOU AND MORE.

00:41:11.535 --> 00:41:12.102
THANK YOU MISTER DAVIS THANK YOU

00:41:12.169 --> 00:41:13.771

EARLY SENATOR MORE LIKE AN NO

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:16.140
WORRIES IT'S PERFECTLY

00:41:16.207 --> 00:41:17.842
LEGITIMATE ESPECIALLY IN THE

00:41:17.908 --> 00:41:20.044
OVERVIEW TO ASK THINGS LIKE WHY

00:41:20.110 --> 00:41:21.445
IS THEIR POSITION GROWTH.

00:41:21.512 --> 00:41:22.446
WHY IS THERE NOT RE PURPOSING OF

00:41:22.513 --> 00:41:25.249
BECAUSE THINGS WHICH THEN WHEN

00:41:25.316 --> 00:41:27.685
WE GET INTO THE PARTICULAR ITEM

00:41:27.751 --> 00:41:30.454
WE CAN EVEN GET MORE GRANULAR?

00:41:30.521 --> 00:41:32.156
BUT I JUST WANT ONE MAKE ONE NO

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:34.225
BEFORE I TURN TO SENATOR BELT.

00:41:34.291 --> 00:41:37.328
AROUND PROP SEVEN SINCE YOU

00:41:37.394 --> 00:41:38.128
ASKED A SPECIFIC QUESTION.

00:41:38.195 --> 00:41:39.663
AND CERTAINLY VERY IMPORTANT FOR

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.298
US TO MONITOR BUT I THINK WHAT

00:41:41.365 --> 00:41:47.371
WE WHEN WE LOOK AT THE THE DATA

00:41:47.438 --> 00:41:50.474
AND IT'S IT'S NOT --

00:41:50.541 --> 00:41:52.209
ACROSS THE BOARD YET IN TERMS OF

00:41:52.276 --> 00:41:53.711
THESE PROPERTY CRIMES AND SUCH

00:41:53.777 --> 00:41:56.046
BUT THERE ARE DIFFERENT PLACES

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:56.580
IN THE STATE WHERE IT HAS

00:41:56.647 --> 00:41:57.982
INCREASED.

00:41:58.048 --> 00:41:58.616
WHAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO

00:41:58.682 --> 00:41:59.683
NOTE?

00:41:59.750 --> 00:42:02.052
IS THAT PROP FIFTY SEVEN RAKES

00:42:02.119 --> 00:42:03.854
ONLY WENT INTO EFFECT.

00:42:03.921 --> 00:42:05.489
LITTLE MORE THAN A YEAR AGO SO

00:42:05.556 --> 00:42:07.625
THEY WERE ONLY WRAP IT IN IT IN

00:42:07.691 --> 00:42:09.360
THE END OF NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH

00:42:09.426 --> 00:42:11.996
SO IN EFFECT WE'VE HAD A LITTLE

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:14.398
MORE THAN A YEAR OF THEIR AND

00:42:14.465 --> 00:42:14.865
WHAT.

00:42:14.932 --> 00:42:17.301
THE CREDIT ALLOW THE IN MAY TO

00:42:17.368 --> 00:42:21.739
DO IS GIVES THEM A LITTLE --

00:42:21.805 --> 00:42:23.374
TIME BEFORE THEY GO TO PROBE IT

00:42:23.440 --> 00:42:25.743
DOESN'T GUARANTEE.

00:42:25.809 --> 00:42:27.912
THEIR RELEASE IT ISN'T LIKE.

00:42:27.978 --> 00:42:29.680
AIDES SAY OUR SENTENCING CHANGES

00:42:29.747 --> 00:42:31.782
THAT MIGHT THEN SAY OKAY YOU

00:42:31.849 --> 00:42:33.484
WERE SPENT FOR THIS ORIGINALLY.

00:42:33.550 --> 00:42:36.053
BUT ACTUALLY UNDER THIS NEW LAW

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.121
YOU SHOULD HAVE ONLY BEEN CENTS

00:42:37.187 --> 00:42:38.656
FOR THAT SO YOU'RE ELIGIBLE NOW

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:39.657
FOR RELEASE.

00:42:39.723 --> 00:42:41.425
THE PROP FIFTY SEVEN ONLY GIVES

00:42:41.492 --> 00:42:44.528
YOU SO NOW I HAVE A FOUR MUCH

00:42:44.595 --> 00:42:46.563
QUICKER TO GO BEFORE PAROLE AND

00:42:46.630 --> 00:42:47.898
I KNOW THAT.

00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:49.366
AS OBVIOUSLY IF SINCE IT'S ONLY

00:42:49.433 --> 00:42:50.334
BEEN IN EFFECT FOR LITTLE MORE

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:52.303
THAN A YEAR YOU WOULDN'T HAVE

00:42:52.369 --> 00:42:54.305
THAT MANY PEOPLE YET.

00:42:54.371 --> 00:42:55.739
HAVING GONE BEFORE PAROLE SO YOU

00:42:55.806 --> 00:42:57.841
WORTH IT FOR US TO GET THE DATA

00:42:57.908 --> 00:43:00.577
ON HOW MANY PEOPLE HAVE YOU BEEN.

00:43:00.644 --> 00:43:03.514
UNDER FIFTY SEVEN BEEN ADVANCED.

00:43:03.580 --> 00:43:06.317
THE OTHER THING TO KNOW IN EARLY

00:43:06.383 --> 00:43:08.719
LATER IS THAT WE ONLY HAVE AN

00:43:08.786 --> 00:43:10.754
18% RATE.

00:43:10.821 --> 00:43:12.323
OF IF YOU GO BEFORE PAROLE

00:43:12.389 --> 00:43:14.024
YOU'RE BEING RELEASED.

00:43:14.091 --> 00:43:15.492
SO EVERYONE GOES BEFORE A PAROLE

00:43:15.559 --> 00:43:19.830
IT'S ONLY 18% THAT SO MY OWN.

00:43:19.897 --> 00:43:21.532
SUSPICION WE HAVE TO GET DATA IS

00:43:21.598 --> 00:43:22.967
THAT.

00:43:23.033 --> 00:43:25.336
WE'VE NOT HAD VERY MANY PEOPLE

00:43:25.402 --> 00:43:27.805
RELEASED AS A RESULT OF PROPERTY.

00:43:27.871 --> 00:43:30.874
SO IF WE ARE LOOKING AT OF

00:43:30.941 --> 00:43:33.177
REPEAT OFFENDERS IT MAY BE MORE

00:43:33.243 --> 00:43:35.479
FROM THE COUNTY JAIL LEVEL

00:43:35.546 --> 00:43:37.181
THOUGH I DON'T EVEN KNOW YET

00:43:37.247 --> 00:43:39.450
WHETHER OR ANY TYPE OF PROPERTY

00:43:39.516 --> 00:43:40.617
CRIME.

00:43:40.684 --> 00:43:42.519
HAS BEEN REPEAT OFFENDERS OR

00:43:42.586 --> 00:43:44.054
WHETHER IT'S NEW OFFENDERS SO I

00:43:44.121 --> 00:43:46.523
JUST MAKE THOSE POINTS BECAUSE

00:43:46.590 --> 00:43:48.058
IT'S CONVENIENT SOMETIMES A LINK

00:43:48.125 --> 00:43:49.526
THESE THINGS.

00:43:49.593 --> 00:43:50.894
BUT WE DON'T YET DATA THE GIVES

00:43:50.961 --> 00:43:52.629
US ANY REAL ABILITY TO LIKE

00:43:52.696 --> 00:43:54.431
THOSE THINGS.

00:43:54.498 --> 00:43:56.333
AND M. JUST TO ADD JUST A LITTLE

00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.501
BIT MORE --

00:43:57.568 --> 00:43:58.569
I THINK THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

00:43:58.635 --> 00:44:01.105
TO HOPE TO MEET SOME OF THE SOME

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:01.638
OF THE QUESTIONS WITH THE

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:37.694
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR FACILITIES

00:51:37.761 --> 00:51:40.230
AFTER ALL THE DECADE THAT I'VE

00:51:40.297 --> 00:51:41.865
BEEN HERE WORKING WITH THE COURT

00:51:41.932 --> 00:51:43.366
ORDER AND ALL THE THINGS WE'VE

00:51:43.433 --> 00:51:44.501
DONE.

00:51:44.568 --> 00:51:47.370
TO IMPROVE OUR FACILITIES.

00:51:47.437 --> 00:51:50.440
THE CAPITAL INVESTMENTS THE THE

00:51:50.507 --> 00:51:52.709
STAFF INVESTMENTS ALL OF MONEY

00:51:52.776 --> 00:51:53.844
THAT WE SPENT.

00:51:53.910 --> 00:51:55.512
AND THEN WE HAVE THESE PRIVATE

00:51:55.579 --> 00:51:57.013
PRISONS THAT HAVE LIKE.

00:51:57.080 --> 00:51:59.282
THE JUST NOT EVEN COMPARABLE

00:51:59.349 --> 00:52:01.051
STANDARDS TO THE STANDARDS THAT

00:52:01.117 --> 00:52:02.586
WE HAVE.

00:52:02.652 --> 00:52:04.688
IN OUR FACILITY SO I THINK IT'S

00:52:04.754 --> 00:52:08.625
FAIR TO SAY THAT WE WANT --

00:52:08.692 --> 00:52:09.192
TO GET PEOPLE OUT OF THOSE

00:52:09.259 --> 00:52:10.293
PRIVATE.

FACILITIES BECAUSE QUITE

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:13.830
PERSONALLY I THINK THERE ARE.

00:52:13.897 --> 00:52:14.598
THERE REALLY --

00:52:14.664 --> 00:52:16.900
NOT TREATED THE SAME AS SOMEBODY

00:52:16.967 --> 00:52:20.637

00:52:20.704 --> 00:52:22.239
BILLION WHICH YOU AGREE WITH THE

00:52:22.305 --> 00:52:23.206
GENERAL CONCEPT.

00:52:23.273 --> 00:52:25.375
I THINK IN GENERAL I WOULD LIKE

00:52:25.442 --> 00:52:26.910
TO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS THAT THE

00:52:26.977 --> 00:52:28.478
OVERSIGHT OF THE PRIVATE

00:52:28.545 --> 00:52:30.881

00:52:30.947 --> 00:52:32.549
DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND WE

00:52:32.616 --> 00:52:34.284
THE THE STANDARDS THAT WE HAVE

00:52:34.351 --> 00:52:35.085
IN THE PROGRAMS.

00:52:35.151 --> 00:52:35.919
THE OVERSIGHT COMES FROM THE

00:52:35.986 --> 00:52:38.455
DEPARTMENT THERE'S AN THAT WE

00:52:38.522 --> 00:52:39.589
ADDRESS IT.

00:52:39.656 --> 00:52:42.025
BUT AS IN HOW TO BEST USE THE

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:43.260
THE DOLLARS OF THE CITIZENS THE

00:52:43.326 --> 00:52:44.594
CALIFORNIA --

00:52:44.661 --> 00:52:45.996
I I BELIEVE IN WHAT WE DO

00:52:46.062 --> 00:52:47.664
INSTEAD OF OUR PRISONS --

00:52:47.731 --> 00:52:49.232
BUT I KNOW THIS IS A DELICATE

00:52:49.299 --> 00:52:51.234
BALANCE ON WE BRING THEM BACK

00:52:51.301 --> 00:52:53.703
BUT ALSO RECOGNIZING THAT ONE

00:52:53.770 --> 00:52:54.971

00:54:30.233 --> 00:54:32.469
ON THE BUDGET.

00:54:32.535 --> 00:54:33.436

ABOUT MAINTENANCE AND ALL THAT

00:54:37.841 --> 00:54:39.275
I'M EXCITED ABOUT TALKING ABOUT

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.510
THAT BECAUSE I THINK.

00:54:40.577 --> 00:54:41.811
I'VE BEEN LONG WAITING FOR A

00:54:41.878 --> 00:54:45.382

I WANT TO KNOW ABOUT --

00:54:49.319 --> 00:54:52.188
THE TATTOO REMOVAL.

00:54:52.255 --> 00:54:54.691
PROGRAM I THINK THAT'S AYE AYE

00:54:54.758 --> 00:54:56.259
IF IT'S NOT REALLY A KEY FOR THE

00:54:56.326 --> 00:54:58.595
PRISON IT'S WHAT I HEAR FROM

00:54:58.662 --> 00:54:59.896
PEOPLE IN THE PRISONS ARE IT'S

00:54:59.963 --> 00:55:02.699
NOT REALLY SOMETHING THEY WANT.

00:55:02.766 --> 00:55:03.633
TO DO.

00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:04.501
BUT THERE'S PEOPLE THAT ARE IN

00:55:04.567 --> 00:55:06.536
THE COUNTY JAILS AND ALL OVER

00:55:06.603 --> 00:55:08.705
THEY WANT TO DO IT SO.

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:11.875
IT'S IS A BIGGER ISSUE THAN WE

00:55:11.941 --> 00:55:13.443
MIGHT REALIZE THAT PEOPLE WANT

00:55:13.510 --> 00:55:15.512

I I AM IN FULL SUPPORT OF THAT --

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:21.317
I THINK WHAT ONCE AN INDIVIDUAL

00:55:21.384 --> 00:55:22.952
MAKES THAT CHOICE TO REMOVE.

00:55:23.019 --> 00:55:25.722
THE TATTOO THEY'RE MAKING THAT

00:55:25.789 --> 00:55:28.158
CHOICE THEY THEY DO WANT.

00:55:28.224 --> 00:55:28.792
TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT ROCK

00:55:28.858 --> 00:55:30.160

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.911
WHATEVER OTHER PRIORITY THE

01:11:22.978 --> 01:11:25.280
STATE MAY HAVE ISN'T ALREADY.

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.915
MANDATED BY NO IT'S NON

01:11:26.982 --> 01:11:28.217
DISCRETIONARY.

01:11:28.283 --> 01:11:29.451
SO OF COURSE WE HAVE A

01:11:29.518 --> 01:11:31.854
RESPONSIBILITY.

WAY POSSIBLE TO MAKE SURE THAT.

01:11:42.231 --> 01:11:45.100
WE ARE PROPERLY HOLDING PEOPLE

01:11:45.167 --> 01:11:46.802
THAT ARE VERY DANGEROUS.

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:48.937
AND THAT ANY PEOPLE THAT WE

01:11:49.004 --> 01:11:50.139

01:12:05.187 --> 01:12:08.290
THAT BUT WHETHER THAT MEANS AN

01:12:08.357 --> 01:12:09.692
INCREASE IN F. T. P..

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:11.360
GIVEN THAT WE HAVE A REDUCTION

01:12:11.427 --> 01:12:13.796
IN POPULATION I THINK.

01:12:13.862 --> 01:12:15.297
NEED TO BE ALWAYS VERY CAREFULLY

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:17.533
LOOKED AT AND WHAT I SEE IS

01:12:17.599 --> 01:12:19.101
EVERY TIME.

01:12:19.168 --> 01:12:22.137
A BILL PASSES.

01:12:22.204 --> 01:12:23.605
WELL YES THEY DON'T NECESSARILY

01:12:23.672 --> 01:12:25.507

[inaudible]

01:12:30.145 --> 01:12:31.914
NOT.

01:12:31.980 --> 01:12:34.116
NOT LEGITIMATE IF YOU LOOK AT

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.418
HOW DO WE UTILIZE.

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:38.420
YES WE HAVE NEW PRIORITIES.

01:12:38.487 --> 01:12:39.688
SO HOW DO WE UTILIZE THE STAFF

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:43.892
WE HAVE. TO ADDRESS THOSE NEEDS.

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:46.762
SO YOU CAN COMMENT BUT OTHERWISE --

01:12:46.829 --> 01:12:47.429
WE CAN --

01:12:47.496 --> 01:12:48.697
HERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:50.999
FINANCE AND THEN I CAN CALL MY

01:12:51.066 --> 01:12:52.034
COLLEAGUES.

01:12:52.101 --> 01:12:53.736
ALL THE CHAIRS POINTS ARE WELL

01:12:53.802 --> 01:12:55.337
TAKEN AND BASED ON A STAFFER

01:12:55.404 --> 01:12:56.138
QUESTIONS LEADING UP TO THE

01:12:56.205 --> 01:12:57.506
COMMITTEE MEETING AND AND OTHER

01:12:57.573 --> 01:12:58.474
ENQUIRIES.

01:12:58.540 --> 01:13:00.175
IT'S BECOME APPARENT TO US THAT

01:13:00.242 --> 01:13:00.943
WE NEED TO WORK WITH THE STAFF

01:13:01.009 --> 01:13:02.845
AND BASICALLY RE ENGINEER THE

01:13:02.911 --> 01:13:03.645
MODEL.

01:13:03.712 --> 01:13:05.013
I I JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:13:05.080 --> 01:13:07.316
WHAT CAME FORWARD WAS MEANT IN

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:08.817
THE BEST OF INTENTIONS IT WASN'T.

01:13:08.884 --> 01:13:10.853
SIMPLY TO AUGMENT A FOR A

01:13:10.919 --> 01:13:12.287
PARTICULAR PERIOD.

01:13:12.354 --> 01:13:14.523
THAT IS THE BUBBLE THAT I THINK

01:13:14.590 --> 01:13:17.926
AT THE CHERRY IT WAS ACTUALLY A

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:19.661
RECONSIDERATION OF THE MODEL.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:21.230
AND WHERE THE CURRENT STAFFING

01:13:21.296 --> 01:13:22.264
AND THE CURRENT MODEL WITH IT'S

01:13:22.331 --> 01:13:23.999
TIME LINES WAS BUILT ON THE

01:13:24.066 --> 01:13:25.134
PREVIOUS WHEN YOU'RE STASHED

01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.001
IMITATIONS.

01:13:26.068 --> 01:13:28.403
IT WAS AN EFFORT TO ACCOMPLISH

01:13:28.470 --> 01:13:29.638
THAT WORK IN A SIX MONTH PERIOD

01:13:29.705 --> 01:13:31.640
OF TIME SO THAT THERE WOULD BE

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:33.175
COMPLETED INVESTIGATIONS

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.676
AVAILABLE FOR RELEASE.

01:13:34.743 --> 01:13:36.311
UNDER FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE SO IT

01:13:36.378 --> 01:13:38.514
WAS A REIMAGINE OF THE MODEL OF

01:13:38.580 --> 01:13:39.982
THE TIMELINE THAT.

01:13:40.048 --> 01:13:42.151
CREATED THE INCREASE BUT I THINK

01:13:42.217 --> 01:13:42.951
YOU KNOW WITH THE CLEAR

01:13:43.018 --> 01:13:44.486
DIRECTION IS BEING PROVIDED IN

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:45.254
THE INPUT.

01:13:45.320 --> 01:13:46.622
I WE CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND THAT

01:13:46.688 --> 01:13:50.759
WE NEED TO RETURN AND LOOK AT

01:13:50.826 --> 01:13:52.628
THE ACTUAL NUMBERS AND PERHAPS

01:13:52.694 --> 01:13:53.862
THAT A GRAND SLAM WE WERE

01:13:53.929 --> 01:13:54.863
SWINGING.

01:13:54.930 --> 01:13:55.831
FOR NEEDS TO BE ADJUSTED TO SOME

01:13:55.898 --> 01:13:56.965
OF THE REALITIES THAT --

01:13:57.032 --> 01:13:58.467
THE TEARS DESCRIBING WE'RE

01:13:58.534 --> 01:14:00.135
CERTAINLY HAPPY TO ANSWER AS

01:14:00.202 --> 01:14:02.037
MANY QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:04.006
PROPOSAL WAS PUT TOGETHER AND

01:14:04.072 --> 01:14:05.607
WHAT THE AIRLINES SECTIONS ABOUT

01:14:05.674 --> 01:14:06.308
IT WERE --

01:14:06.375 --> 01:14:08.343
BUT I I SAY THIS KNOWING THAT IN

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:11.380
THE END THERE'S MORE WORK TO BE

01:14:11.446 --> 01:14:14.817
DONE IN THIS AREA.

01:14:14.883 --> 01:14:15.417
FRANCE AND YOU WANT TO MAKE A

01:14:15.484 --> 01:14:16.919
COMMENT.

01:14:16.985 --> 01:14:18.453
RICH MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:19.621
CAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE TO

01:14:19.688 --> 01:14:21.690
METHODOLOGY OF SB FOURTEEN

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.458
TWENTY ONE HOW WE CAME TO THAT

01:14:23.525 --> 01:14:26.128
REQUEST --

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.896
JEEZ I DID NOT ALSO POINT OUT

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:29.498
THAT IN THE DOCUMENT.

01:14:29.565 --> 01:14:31.667
THAT WE RECEIVED IT DOES SHOW AS

01:14:31.733 --> 01:14:34.903
YOU STATED THAT WAS BASED ON A

01:14:34.970 --> 01:14:36.972
SIXTY DAY INVESTIGATIVE PERIOD

01:14:37.039 --> 01:14:38.473
AND I HAVE TO WONDER.

01:14:38.540 --> 01:14:40.342
WHY APPRECIATE EXPLANATION THAT

01:14:40.409 --> 01:14:41.777
WAS GIVEN HERE?

01:14:41.844 --> 01:14:44.112
THE ORIGINAL THE LANGUAGE OF THE

01:14:44.179 --> 01:14:45.881
BILL BEFORE IT WAS AMENDED SO

01:14:45.948 --> 01:14:47.382
BEFORE IT WAS SIGNED BEFORE IT

01:14:47.449 --> 01:14:49.751
FINALIZED IN THE LEGISLATIVE

01:14:49.818 --> 01:14:51.386
PROCESS BEFORE WE SIGN.

01:14:51.453 --> 01:14:53.388
DID HAVE A SIXTY DAY

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.090
INVESTIGATORY PERIOD AROUND THE

01:14:55.157 --> 01:14:56.124
USE OF FORCE BUT THAT WAS

01:14:56.191 --> 01:14:58.694
CHANGED TO ONE EIGHTY SO I I

01:14:58.760 --> 01:15:00.696
HAVE TO WONDER WHETHER.

01:15:00.762 --> 01:15:04.566
THE THIS IS SESSION WAS BASED ON

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:06.668
IN INACCURATE READING OF THE

01:15:06.735 --> 01:15:08.670
FINAL BILL.

01:15:08.737 --> 01:15:10.205
I FELT THEIR THEM FOR THE PART

01:15:10.272 --> 01:15:11.106
OF FINANCE COMMENTS I THINK IT'S

01:15:11.173 --> 01:15:13.208
THAT COMES DOWN TO THE TIMELINE

01:15:13.275 --> 01:15:14.676
THAT WE CONSIDER THE ACTUAL

01:15:14.743 --> 01:15:16.078
INVESTIGATION GENERALLY KERN

01:15:16.144 --> 01:15:17.746
THERE'S A PERIOD OF TIME.

01:15:17.813 --> 01:15:18.881
WHEN THE GRIEVANCE TO THE

01:15:18.947 --> 01:15:20.716
ALLEGATION IS IS BROUGHT FORWARD --

01:15:20.782 --> 01:15:21.350
WHERE IT'S --

01:15:21.416 --> 01:15:22.918
BROUGHT TO I WAS REFERRED TO AS

01:15:22.985 --> 01:15:26.455
THE TION OF INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

01:15:26.521 --> 01:15:28.190
AND THEN IT GOES TO

01:15:28.257 --> 01:15:29.725
INVESTIGATION THERE NEEDS TO BE

01:15:29.791 --> 01:15:31.727
TIME LEFT ON THAT END OF THE

01:15:31.793 --> 01:15:33.228
INVESTIGATION FOR BOTH --

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:34.830
THE HIGHER THREE TO REACH

01:15:34.897 --> 01:15:36.565
DECISIONS AND FOR ANY NOTICE OF

01:15:36.632 --> 01:15:37.699
ADVERSE ACTION TO BE ISSUED TO

01:15:37.766 --> 01:15:39.368
EMPLOYEES SO.

01:15:39.434 --> 01:15:41.203
IN REFERENCE IN THE SIXTY DAYS I

01:15:41.270 --> 01:15:42.304
DON'T BELIEVE IT WAS A MIS READ

01:15:42.371 --> 01:15:43.605
OF THE LEGISLATIVE CHANGE.

01:15:43.672 --> 01:15:44.973
IT WAS TRYING TO CAPTURE THE

01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:46.642
PERIOD OF TIME THAT EXIST BEFORE

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:49.578
ALL OF THE IN TAKES STEPS GET TO

01:15:49.645 --> 01:15:51.079
AN AGENT FOR INVESTIGATION.

01:15:51.146 --> 01:15:52.681
AND WHEN THE AGENT IS OBLIGATED

01:15:52.748 --> 01:15:54.416
TO COMPLETE THAT INVESTIGATION

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:56.218
SO THAT ALL THE FINALIZATION

01:15:56.285 --> 01:15:58.453
STEPS CAN PROPERLY OCCUR BEFORE

01:15:58.520 --> 01:15:59.988
THE TIMELINE IS MATT SO IT'S A

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.456
COLLAPSED WINDOW.

01:16:01.523 --> 01:16:05.694
THAT IS CORRECT THERE'S ALSO AN

01:16:05.761 --> 01:16:07.896
ADDITIONAL TIME AFTER.

01:16:07.963 --> 01:16:09.431
WHERE IT'S AT THE INSTITUTIONAL

01:16:09.498 --> 01:16:11.600
LEVEL WHERE IT'S BEING REVIEWED?

01:16:11.667 --> 01:16:12.801
MAY GO THROUGH THE INSTITUTIONAL

01:16:12.868 --> 01:16:15.103
USE OF FORCE COMMITTEE BY

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:16.672
JENNIFER BEFORE EVEN COMES TO

01:16:16.738 --> 01:16:17.739
THE INTERNAL AFFAIRS.

01:16:17.806 --> 01:16:20.375
CONSIDER FOR INVESTIGATION.

01:16:20.442 --> 01:16:21.977
AND SO BACK YET THAT AND HUNDRED

01:16:22.044 --> 01:16:22.511
EIGHTY DAYS ENCOMPASS THE

01:16:22.577 --> 01:16:24.680
INTEGRITY OF INCIDENT OCCURRING

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:25.814
WHAT HAPPENS IF HE'S.

01:16:25.881 --> 01:16:27.082
LEVEL COMING TO INTERNAL AFFAIRS

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:29.184
INTAKE MOVING TO INVESTIGATION

01:16:29.251 --> 01:16:31.253
MOVING TO DISCIPLINE AND TAKING

01:16:31.320 --> 01:16:33.922
DISCIPLINARY ACTION.

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:37.025
SO WHAT CLASS.

01:16:37.092 --> 01:16:38.694
BERMAN FINANCE GO AHEAD.

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.461
I WOULD LIKE IN THE DEPARTMENT

ADMINISTRATIVE CASES WHICH CAN'T

01:16:46.635 --> 01:16:47.769
BE DELAYED IF THEY'RE SUBJECT TO

01:16:47.836 --> 01:16:48.804
CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION THE

01:24:24.058 --> 01:24:26.060
MUCH LESS OF A AGAINST ON

RIGHT [inaudible] SEVEN YEAH.

01:24:46.247 --> 01:24:47.849

TO HANDLE YOUR INVESTIGATIONS

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:57.025
DIFFERENTLY I THINK YOU SHOULD

01:24:57.091 --> 01:24:58.593
HAVE SEPARATED THE PCP BECAUSE

01:24:58.660 --> 01:24:59.994
THERE'S NOTHING IN.

01:25:00.061 --> 01:25:01.863
OUR WHAT FOURTEEN TWENTY ONE

SUBMITTED SEPARATELY.

01:25:10.038 --> 01:25:12.440

ALL THE REQUEST THAT WE RECEIVED

01:30:16.611 --> 01:30:18.312
AND DO A PRIORITIZATION BASED ON

01:30:18.379 --> 01:30:19.914
A VARIETY OF FACTORS --

01:30:19.981 --> 01:30:21.816

01:33:53.394 --> 01:33:54.829
IMPORTANT INVESTMENT --

01:33:54.895 --> 01:33:56.430
WE TALK A LOT ABOUT --

AND IN THESE SORTS OF

01:34:10.077 --> 01:34:12.046
INVESTMENTS ARE THAT THE TYPE OF

01:34:12.113 --> 01:34:13.414

DEPARTMENT IS TO SPEAK TO THAT

01:34:28.796 --> 01:34:30.531
BUT I I THINK IN GENERAL --

01:34:30.598 --> 01:34:32.199
WE TRY TO BE AS FORTHCOMING AS

01:34:32.266 --> 01:34:34.769
WE CAN BE WITH INFORMATION ABOUT --

01:34:34.835 --> 01:34:36.437

HOW WE APPROACH THE MADE US I I

01:34:49.850 --> 01:34:52.720
I THINK IT HAS AS TO BE --

01:34:52.787 --> 01:34:53.687
PART OF OUR BUDGET AND I'M GLAD

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:57.525

01:34:57.591 --> 01:34:58.959
I THINK THEY'RE A GOOD WAY OF

01:34:59.026 --> 01:35:01.062
DOING MAINTENANCE PROJECTS ON A

01:35:01.128 --> 01:35:02.930

ONGOING MAINTENANCE COSTS.

01:35:08.002 --> 01:35:09.770
AND THEN LOOK AT ANOTHER

01:35:09.837 --> 01:35:11.138
CATEGORY WOULD BE --

01:35:14.975 --> 01:35:15.509
SHOULD HAVE BEEN DONE A WHILE

IF YOU TAKE CARE OF OF THEN --

01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:26.120
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE CARE MANY

01:35:26.187 --> 01:35:27.888

COULD HAVE BEEN DOING --

01:35:51.912 --> 01:35:54.248
THROUGH MULTI YEAR PLANNING --

01:35:54.315 --> 01:35:56.717

01:37:54.969 --> 01:37:56.737
YOU DON'T WANT TO GROW YOU WANNA

01:37:56.804 --> 01:37:58.372
SHRINK THE NUMBER.

01:37:58.439 --> 01:38:00.040
BUT IF YOU DON'T SPEND ENOUGH

01:38:00.107 --> 01:38:03.210
MONEY ON SHIPPING AWAY OUT AT

01:38:03.277 --> 01:38:05.412
THE MAIN AS BACKLOG WILL GROW.

01:38:05.479 --> 01:38:07.014
AND WE HAVE TO FIND THAT SWEET

01:38:07.081 --> 01:38:10.117
SPOT WE'RE IT ACTUALLY STARTS TO

01:38:10.184 --> 01:38:11.151
SHRINK.

01:38:11.218 --> 01:38:12.653
THE MAINTENANCE BACKLOG.

01:38:12.720 --> 01:38:14.121
OF WHERE WOULD YOU SAY THAT

01:38:14.188 --> 01:38:15.789
NUMBER WOULD BE.

01:38:15.856 --> 01:38:17.291
IT'S I'D I'D I DON'T HAVE A

01:38:17.358 --> 01:38:18.826
SPECIFIC DOLLAR NUMBER BUT I

01:38:18.892 --> 01:38:20.060
THINK IT IS A COMBINATION OF

01:38:20.127 --> 01:38:22.529
LIFE OF WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND

01:38:22.596 --> 01:38:22.796
ALL THAT.

01:38:22.863 --> 01:38:24.832
STUFF TO YOU BY.

01:38:24.898 --> 01:38:25.733
IT'S IT'S A COMBINATION OF THESE

01:38:25.799 --> 01:38:27.134
ONE TIME DEFERRED MAINTENANCE UP

01:38:27.201 --> 01:38:28.602
OPERATIONS ADMIN COMING

01:38:28.669 --> 01:38:30.404
PREVIOUSLY IN SECTION SIX POINT --

01:38:30.471 --> 01:38:32.473
ONE AND NOW IN THIS PCP BUT ALSO

01:38:32.539 --> 01:38:34.775
THE ABILITY FOR OUR PLANT STAFF

01:38:34.842 --> 01:38:36.410
TO HAVE A AN ANNUAL MAINTENANCE

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.845
BUDGET TAT ALLOWS THEM TO IF

01:38:37.911 --> 01:38:39.113
THEY'VE GOT TWENTY FIVE THEY'RE

01:38:39.179 --> 01:38:39.913
HANDLING UNITS THAT THEY KNOW

01:38:39.980 --> 01:38:41.148
ARE TWENTY YEARS OLD.

01:38:41.215 --> 01:38:42.383
AND THEY'RE ALL GOING TO FAIL

01:38:42.449 --> 01:38:43.917
SOMETIME IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE

01:38:43.984 --> 01:38:45.152
BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY TO

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:45.953
REPLACE THEM.

01:38:46.020 --> 01:38:46.787
IT BECOMES A DEFERRED

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.222
MAINTENANCE PROJECT AND WE HOPE

01:38:48.289 --> 01:38:49.823
WE GET TO THEM BEFORE THEY

01:38:49.890 --> 01:38:51.158
COMPLETELY FAIL.

01:38:51.225 --> 01:38:53.394
IF WE'RE ABLE TO FUND THEM ON

01:38:53.460 --> 01:38:57.464
AND AND AND SAY IN THE NEXT FOUR

01:38:57.531 --> 01:38:58.599
FIVE YEARS I WILL REPLACE ALL OF

01:38:58.666 --> 01:38:59.833
THOSE ARE HANDING UNITS WITHIN

01:38:59.900 --> 01:39:01.435
MY OWN BUDGET AND THEN IT DOES

01:39:01.502 --> 01:39:02.369
NOT BECOME A DEFERRED

01:39:02.436 --> 01:39:04.204
MAINTENANCE PROJECT IT BECOMES

01:39:04.271 --> 01:39:05.172
SOMETHING THEY HANDLE YOU

01:39:05.239 --> 01:39:05.773
UNDERSTAND WHAT I'M SAYING.

01:39:05.839 --> 01:39:07.808
YEAH I THINK I THINK --

01:39:07.875 --> 01:39:09.910
FOR ME.

01:39:09.977 --> 01:39:11.078
I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK AT IT IN A

01:39:11.145 --> 01:39:12.813
COMPREHENSIVE WAY.

01:39:12.880 --> 01:39:15.215
SO WE ANALYZE HOW HOW MUCH MONEY

01:39:15.282 --> 01:39:16.383
WE NEED TO SPEND ON AN ANNUAL

01:39:16.450 --> 01:39:17.885
BASIS.

01:39:17.951 --> 01:39:20.521
OF RATHER THAN ARBITRARILY SET A

01:39:20.587 --> 01:39:22.589
NUMBER.

01:39:22.656 --> 01:39:24.091
I DON'T KNOW IF OTHER PEOPLE

01:39:24.158 --> 01:39:24.692
AGREE WITH THIS BUT I'M I'M A

01:39:24.758 --> 01:39:26.460
BIG.

01:39:26.527 --> 01:39:28.262
MAINTENANCE IS A PLANNING

01:39:28.329 --> 01:39:29.763
EXERCISE.

01:39:29.830 --> 01:39:31.365
A BUDGET PLANNING AS A MULTI

01:39:31.432 --> 01:39:32.700
YEAR BUDGET PLANNING OUR FIRST

01:39:32.766 --> 01:39:34.468
YOU HAVE TO FIGURE OUT.

01:39:34.535 --> 01:39:36.770
WHERE THE RIGHT SPOT IS? TO

01:39:36.837 --> 01:39:38.572
START.

01:39:38.639 --> 01:39:39.740
TO BECAUSE SAY WHAT WE'RE GONNA

01:39:39.807 --> 01:39:40.808
LIMóN THEY JUST TO FOR THIS

01:39:40.874 --> 01:39:43.177
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AND

01:39:43.243 --> 01:39:44.778
FIFTEEN YEARS OR TEN YEARS OR

01:39:44.845 --> 01:39:46.180
AND THEN YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:39:46.246 --> 01:39:48.215
THAT LINE'S GOING TO BE AND THEN.

01:39:48.282 --> 01:39:51.118
FIGURE OUT HOW MUCH MONEY YOU'RE

01:39:51.185 --> 01:39:52.219
YOU HAVE TO SPEND YOU KNOW.

01:39:52.286 --> 01:39:52.753
OTHERWISE IT'LL JUST KEEP

01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.921
GROWING [inaudible]

01:39:53.987 --> 01:39:57.791
AND OR KELSO WILL BE AT OUR

01:39:57.858 --> 01:40:00.427
MEETINGS FOR THE REST OF OUR

01:40:00.494 --> 01:40:03.397
LIVES RIGHT AND HILL.

01:40:03.464 --> 01:40:06.266
HE'LL BE HERE FOREVER

01:40:06.333 --> 01:40:07.234
EVERYBODY'S GOING TO BE SO IN A

01:40:07.301 --> 01:40:09.436
WELL AT LEAST THROUGH THE RULES

01:40:09.503 --> 01:40:11.171
ORLEAKING.

MY GOAL IS TO UPGRADE ALL THE

01:40:18.278 --> 01:40:19.480
FACILITIES.

01:40:19.546 --> 01:40:20.614
BUT I NEED TO SEE WHAT THE

01:40:20.681 --> 01:40:21.415
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROPER

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:24.485
LIBERAL FUNDING AS I I HAD AT A

01:40:24.551 --> 01:40:25.419
OF THAT COULD BE DONE.

01:40:25.486 --> 01:40:26.587
IN WORKING WITH THESE COMMITTEES

01:40:26.653 --> 01:40:28.655
I THINK.

01:40:28.722 --> 01:40:30.491
WE WOULD TRY TO ACHIEVE THAT.

01:40:30.557 --> 01:40:33.927
I DON'T KNOW AND WILL RIGHT.

01:40:33.994 --> 01:40:34.762
THAT'S WHERE WORST THAT'S WHAT I

01:40:34.828 --> 01:40:36.163
FEEL.

01:40:36.230 --> 01:40:38.365
RESPONSIBLE THAT I HAVE TO DO.

MAIN ISSUES I HAVE FOR YOUR OUT.

01:40:43.036 --> 01:40:45.005
WHAT THE PLAN IS TO ELIMINATE

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:47.441
THE BACKLOG IN?

01:40:47.508 --> 01:40:48.976
THIS ONCE YOU ELIMINATE IT ISN'T

01:40:49.042 --> 01:40:52.146
TRUE THE OPERATING COSTS IN THE

01:40:52.212 --> 01:40:54.415
ROMANUS POSSIBLY MUCH LESS.

01:40:54.481 --> 01:40:55.416
IT WOULD BE LESS YOU AVOID

01:40:55.482 --> 01:40:57.017
EMERGENCY THE TAX EMERGES MONEY

01:40:57.084 --> 01:40:59.887
RICHES BECAUSE OF THINGS --

01:40:59.953 --> 01:41:00.187
FAIL -- I I

01:41:00.254 --> 01:41:04.158
APPRECIATE AND WILL GO BACK FROM

01:41:04.224 --> 01:41:05.325
THIS WORKING WITH FINANCE LA

01:41:05.392 --> 01:41:07.060
WHEN THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND TRY

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:09.930
SOME INFORMATION REGARDING A

01:41:09.997 --> 01:41:10.864
SWEET SPOT --

01:41:10.931 --> 01:41:12.199
AS WE PUT IT REGARDING TO

01:41:12.266 --> 01:41:13.300
ONGOING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE

01:41:13.367 --> 01:41:16.003
FUNDING THE THE OTHER THE OTHER --

01:41:16.069 --> 01:41:17.704
IDEA THAT SOME PEOPLE USE WITH

01:41:17.771 --> 01:41:20.441
MAINTENANCE FIVE DEFERRED

01:41:20.507 --> 01:41:21.475
MAINTENANCE IS --

01:41:21.542 --> 01:41:23.544
A FINANCING IDEAS.

01:41:23.610 --> 01:41:24.077

N. XCELERATED AND IN USING THE

01:41:30.617 --> 01:41:32.653
FINANCING TO ACCELERATE.

01:41:32.719 --> 01:41:35.656
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE --

01:41:35.722 --> 01:41:37.491
PROJECTS SIMILAR TO WHAT YOU'RE

01:41:37.558 --> 01:41:39.092
DOING WITH THE CAPITAL BUDGET

01:41:39.159 --> 01:41:41.628
YOU'RE USING REVENUE BONDS. TO

01:41:41.695 --> 01:41:43.630
EXCEL THE PIXEL RATE SOME OF THE

01:41:43.697 --> 01:41:44.731
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENT BONDS.

01:41:44.798 --> 01:41:46.934
PROJECTS --

01:41:47.000 --> 01:41:48.936
I WONDER IF --

01:41:49.002 --> 01:41:50.604
THE REVENUE BONDS COULD ALSO BE

01:41:50.671 --> 01:41:52.940
USED TO ACCELERATE SOME OF THE

01:41:53.006 --> 01:41:53.507
MAINTENANCE --

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.742
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE PROJECTS

FINANCING OF I'M SORRY NO NO I I

01:42:05.552 --> 01:42:07.221
NO IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS --

01:42:07.287 --> 01:42:08.822
I DON'T KNOW AT SOME POINT WHERE

01:42:08.889 --> 01:42:10.624
I HAVE A FEW MORE CONVERSATION

01:42:10.691 --> 01:42:11.892
ABOUT CAPITAL OUTLAY IN US MY

01:42:11.959 --> 01:42:13.227
CAPITAL OUTLAY COLLEAGUES HERE

01:42:13.293 --> 01:42:13.961
THAT WORK MORE ON THE LEASE

01:42:14.027 --> 01:42:15.596
REVENUE SIDE OF THINGS MIGHT

01:42:15.662 --> 01:42:17.564
HAVE SOME THOUGHTS ON THAT BUT

01:42:17.631 --> 01:42:19.533
NO IMMEDIATE THOUGHTS ON THAT

01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.400
PARTICULAR.

01:42:20.467 --> 01:42:24.371
THE YOU KNOW BARTON THIS IT WHAT

01:42:24.438 --> 01:42:26.974
YEAH GO AHEAD BUDGET JUST IS

01:42:27.040 --> 01:42:27.641
THAT HAVE --

01:42:27.708 --> 01:42:29.476
COMMON AND SPOKEN TO US ABOUT A

01:42:29.543 --> 01:42:31.144
MODEL SUCH AS THAT AND I THINK

01:42:31.211 --> 01:42:31.812
THAT --

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:33.313
THOSE ARE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS

01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:34.248
THAT WE NEED TO HAVE WITHIN THE

01:42:34.314 --> 01:42:35.482
ADMINISTRATION BECAUSE I IT

01:42:35.549 --> 01:42:37.784
COMES DOWN TO WHAT THE FUNDING

01:42:37.851 --> 01:42:38.852
STREAM TO REPAY THOSE BONDS

01:42:38.919 --> 01:42:41.255
WOULD WOULD BE AND BEING ABLE.

01:42:41.321 --> 01:42:43.257
TO ACTUALIZE A SAVINGS PER SE

01:42:43.323 --> 01:42:44.658
FROM GETTING THE MAINTENANCE

01:42:44.725 --> 01:42:47.194
DONE QUICKER THROUGH FINANCING --

01:42:47.261 --> 01:42:48.762
WE WE WE HAVE NOT FOUND THE THE

01:42:48.829 --> 01:42:50.063
ANSWERS TO THAT YET --

01:42:50.130 --> 01:42:51.365
BUT IT'S A I THINK T'S

01:42:51.431 --> 01:42:52.399
CONVERSATIONS ARE GOING TO

01:42:52.466 --> 01:42:53.800
CONTINUE TO BE ONGOING.

01:42:53.867 --> 01:42:55.736
THE THE BASIC GOAL OF FINANCING

01:42:55.802 --> 01:42:58.739
IS TO PROVE THINGS EARLY.

01:42:58.805 --> 01:43:01.308
SO CLARK CAM LEVER MEETINGS AND

01:43:01.375 --> 01:43:02.809
THEN -- HAVE

01:43:02.876 --> 01:43:05.312
THE FACILITIES UPGRADED --

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:07.581
THE PROPER LEVEL AND THEN --

01:43:07.648 --> 01:43:10.784
BE ABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THE THE

01:43:10.851 --> 01:43:13.554
NEEDS OF OUR CALIFORNIA IN TERMS

01:43:13.620 --> 01:43:15.222
OF INCARCERATION.

01:43:15.289 --> 01:43:17.324
BUT MEET THE QUALITY STANDARDS

01:43:17.391 --> 01:43:19.760
THAT WE WANT TO HAVE --

01:43:19.826 --> 01:43:22.296
IN AND FALL THE LEGAL RULES. TO

01:43:22.362 --> 01:43:27.434
DO THAT AND I THINK --

01:43:27.501 --> 01:43:28.302
DEFERRED MADE IT SHOULD BE

01:43:28.368 --> 01:43:32.439
LOOKED AT AS POSSIBILITY --

01:43:32.506 --> 01:43:33.273
TO USE THE REVENUE BROUGHT

01:43:33.340 --> 01:43:35.509
APPROACH --

01:43:35.576 --> 01:43:36.743
DOES AND YOU ALSO WOULD SAVE

01:43:36.810 --> 01:43:39.279
MONEY ON IF YOU LOOK AT IT FROM

01:43:39.346 --> 01:43:40.681
A TENURE PERSPECTIVE OR WHATEVER

01:43:40.747 --> 01:43:41.982
YOU MIGHT.

01:43:42.049 --> 01:43:43.350
FIND IT YOU WOULD SAVE OPERATING

01:43:43.417 --> 01:43:45.319
COST.

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:48.021
AT THE SAME TIME BY NOT HAVING --

01:43:48.088 --> 01:43:51.758
CONSTANT REPAIRING AND BROUGHT

01:43:51.825 --> 01:43:53.760

01:43:57.431 --> 01:43:59.232
ALL THAT ARE THE LAST QUESTION

01:43:59.299 --> 01:44:00.334

HAVE ON THE JOB TRAINING.

01:44:41.274 --> 01:44:42.042
FOR THE TIME THAT THEY WOULD

01:44:42.109 --> 01:44:43.377
LEAVE THEY WOULD HAVE A

01:44:43.443 --> 01:44:45.479
CONSTRUCTION JOB TRAINING.

01:44:45.545 --> 01:44:46.647
THAT'S THE GOAL OF OUR PROGRAMS

01:44:46.713 --> 01:44:49.049
IT'S EASIER ACCOMPLISHED ON SOME

01:44:49.116 --> 01:44:50.450
PRO ON SOME PROJECTS AND OTHER

01:44:50.517 --> 01:44:52.152
PROJECTS BUT IT'S AN ONGOING

01:44:52.219 --> 01:44:53.654
CONVERSATION THAT ARE IN MAY OR

01:44:53.720 --> 01:44:55.722
LABOR PROGRAM IS IS HAVING --

01:44:55.789 --> 01:44:56.690
TO RAISES MANY OF THOSE

01:44:56.757 --> 01:44:58.492
OPPORTUNITIES AS POSSIBLE.

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:00.293
OKAY I'M I'M THAT'S THAT'S I I

01:45:00.360 --> 01:45:02.429
KIND OF FOLLOWED WITH MY POINTS

01:45:02.496 --> 01:45:04.531
THAT I MAKING ABOUT.

01:45:04.598 --> 01:45:06.700
PLANNING MAINTENANCE --

01:45:06.767 --> 01:45:09.970
A I WAS THINKING ABOUT LAST

01:45:10.037 --> 01:45:11.104
NIGHT IT'S NOT THAT MUCH

01:45:11.171 --> 01:45:12.406
DIFFERENT THAN --

01:45:12.472 --> 01:45:15.676
ROAD REPAIR MAINTENANCE WHO'S

01:45:15.742 --> 01:45:16.877

SO I THINK I THINK THERE'S

01:45:25.419 --> 01:45:28.255
THINGS WE CAN DO WITH THIS --

01:45:28.321 --> 01:45:30.891

FRONT AND THEN IT DOES

01:45:47.407 --> 01:45:48.575
ABSOLUTELY.

01:45:48.642 --> 01:45:50.343
REDUCE OUR COSTS IN THE LONG RUN

01:45:50.410 --> 01:45:51.778
IF WE ACTUALLY MAINTAIN OUR

01:45:51.845 --> 01:45:53.680
FACILITIES BEFORE THAT THE POINT

01:45:53.747 --> 01:45:55.482

ALSO LIKE TO TO MAKE CLEAR THAT

01:45:59.686 --> 01:46:00.987
IN THAT THERE IS AN ADDITIONAL

01:46:01.054 --> 01:46:04.825
FUNDING IN ADDITION TO THIS --

01:46:04.891 --> 01:46:05.358
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE MILLION

01:46:05.425 --> 01:46:06.026
DOLLARS THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:46:06.093 --> 01:46:07.728
A ONE TIME BASIS DEPARTMENT HAS

THIS.

01:46:54.508 --> 01:46:56.009

POOL IS JUST IN YOU LEARN THESE

01:48:06.346 --> 01:48:07.814
THINGS.

01:48:07.881 --> 01:48:09.416
AND THEN THE OLDER YOU BY A YOU

01:48:09.482 --> 01:48:11.117
BUY A HOME IN A HOMEOWNERS

01:48:11.184 --> 01:48:12.752
ASSOCIATION AND YOU START PAYING

01:48:12.819 --> 01:48:14.788
MONTHLY DUES.

01:48:14.855 --> 01:48:16.122
AND YOU REALIZE THAT A GOOD

01:48:16.189 --> 01:48:17.490
CHUNK OF THAT MONEY IS GOING

01:48:17.557 --> 01:48:20.594
INTO RESERVES TO REPLACE

01:48:20.660 --> 01:48:21.228
SOMETHING IN THE FUTURE OF THAT

01:48:21.294 --> 01:48:23.830
IT'S OF ON A CASH BASIS YOU HAVE

01:48:23.897 --> 01:48:25.966
ACCUMULATED THE FUNDS TO RE ROOF

01:48:26.032 --> 01:48:28.335
TO REPAINT. TO RESURFACE THE

01:48:28.401 --> 01:48:29.803
ROTORS --

01:48:29.870 --> 01:48:30.303
BUT WE DON'T DO THAT IN

01:48:30.370 --> 01:48:32.372
GOVERNMENT.

01:48:32.439 --> 01:48:33.640
WE FORCED BEFORE CITIZENS TO DO

01:48:33.707 --> 01:48:35.175
THAT.

01:48:35.242 --> 01:48:36.943
IT BY A HOMEOWNERS --

01:48:37.010 --> 01:48:38.311
INTO A HOMER SO SHE BUT WE DON'T

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:39.846
DO THAT.

01:48:39.913 --> 01:48:42.883
AND I'M JUST WONDERING.

01:48:42.949 --> 01:48:45.051
AS IT AS CENTER VALUES THE TERM

01:48:45.118 --> 01:48:46.987
MULTI EUROPE ROACH WHEN DO WE

01:48:47.053 --> 01:48:48.822
GET TO A POINT WHERE YOU SAY

01:48:48.889 --> 01:48:50.090
OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BUILD A

01:48:50.156 --> 01:48:51.925
FACILITY IT'S GOING TO COST US.

01:48:51.992 --> 01:48:53.827
A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AS A

01:48:53.894 --> 01:48:55.762
FOR YOUR LIFE THEN OVER THE

01:48:55.829 --> 01:48:56.863
FORTY YEARS WHERE DO WE THEN

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:59.566
ACCUMULATE THE HUNDRED MILLION

01:48:59.633 --> 01:49:02.502
TO REPLACE IT OR OR RESTORE.

01:49:02.569 --> 01:49:04.771
AND SO WITH THAT I I'M SEEING.

01:49:04.838 --> 01:49:06.506
A FAILURE IN BUDGETING.

01:49:06.573 --> 01:49:08.174
IF WE HAVE TO ISSUE BONDS WE

01:49:08.241 --> 01:49:10.644
FAILED IF WE'VE GOT TO RAISE A

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:12.445
TAX WE FAILED.

01:49:12.512 --> 01:49:14.381
IT WOULD FILL THE TAXPAYERS BY

01:49:14.447 --> 01:49:16.616
NOT PREPARING AND THEN ALL OF A

01:49:16.683 --> 01:49:17.417

THEM AND SAYING OUR PRISONS ARE

01:49:18.285 --> 01:49:21.421
BAD BECAUSE YOU HAVE BEEN CHIP

01:49:21.488 --> 01:49:21.988
IN AND THEY'RE GOING WAIT A

01:49:22.055 --> 01:49:23.590
SECOND.

01:49:23.657 --> 01:49:24.557
AS MAKES SENSE WE'VE BEEN OPEN

01:49:24.624 --> 01:49:26.026
IN.

01:49:26.092 --> 01:49:26.993
OUR ENTIRE LIVES HOW DID YOU

01:49:27.060 --> 01:49:28.662

01:49:31.464 --> 01:49:33.934
REQUEST SO I'M A LITTLE.

01:49:34.000 --> 01:49:35.302
DIFFERENT IN MY FINANCIAL

01:49:35.368 --> 01:49:36.970
APPROACH TO HANDLING THESE

01:49:37.037 --> 01:49:38.972
THINGS BUT I KIND OF LIKE TO SEE

01:49:39.039 --> 01:49:41.241
WHEN WE WORRY ABOUT TE BACKLOG

01:49:41.308 --> 01:49:41.541
WOULD START.

01:49:41.608 --> 01:49:44.077
BEING PROVED WHATEVER WE BUILD

01:49:44.144 --> 01:49:46.346
NEW IF YOU BUILD A NEW PRISON I

01:49:46.413 --> 01:49:49.082
KNOW YOU'RE NOT BUT WHEN YOU DO

01:49:49.149 --> 01:49:50.417
IN THAT WHICH ARE PUTTING

01:49:50.483 --> 01:49:51.551
RESERVES ASIDE.

01:49:51.618 --> 01:49:52.552
AMEDEO IT'S OUR BUILDING A

01:49:52.619 --> 01:49:54.721
DISCIPLINE SO THAT WE DON'T SIT

01:49:54.788 --> 01:49:56.556
HERE LOOKING AT A BILLION DOLLAR.

01:49:56.623 --> 01:49:59.392
BACKLOG.

01:49:59.459 --> 01:50:01.761
YEAH AND IF SOME OF YOUR ANSWER

01:50:01.828 --> 01:50:04.864
IS A GERMANE TO YOUR

01:50:04.931 --> 01:50:07.334
PRESENTATION ON THE MAINTENANCE

01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:08.835
FUNDING METHODOLOGY.

01:50:08.902 --> 01:50:10.904
YOU COULD IN [inaudible]

01:50:10.971 --> 01:50:12.806
YOU MIGHT.

01:50:12.872 --> 01:50:15.342
ANSWER WHATEVER ISN'T.

01:50:15.408 --> 01:50:19.879
AND THEN IN YOUR OPENING ADDRESS.

01:50:19.946 --> 01:50:21.414
WHAT SENATOR MORE LIKE WAS

01:50:21.481 --> 01:50:23.083
ASKING OKAY?

01:50:23.149 --> 01:50:24.684
I THINK THAT ARE FUNDING FOR

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:25.485
MAINTENANCE IS A IS A

01:50:25.552 --> 01:50:26.886
COMBINATION OF DIFFERENT FUNDING

01:50:26.953 --> 01:50:28.088
SOURCES IN A COMBINATIONAL

01:50:28.154 --> 01:50:29.622
LEVERS AT ALL HAVE TO WORK

01:50:29.689 --> 01:50:31.057
TOGETHER --

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:32.392
AND AND I THINK THE CHURCH POINT

01:50:32.459 --> 01:50:34.027
IS VERY WELL TAKEN A LOT OF THE

01:50:34.094 --> 01:50:35.929
ISSUE OF PUTTING MONEY ASIDE IN

01:50:35.996 --> 01:50:37.163
ORDER TO KEEP FIXING THINGS.

01:50:37.230 --> 01:50:38.298
KNOWING THEY'RE GOING TO NEED TO

01:50:38.365 --> 01:50:40.166
BE FIXED IS --

01:50:40.233 --> 01:50:41.668
WHAT ARE?

01:50:41.735 --> 01:50:42.035
MAINTENANCE --

01:50:42.102 --> 01:50:42.635
METHODOLOGY --

01:50:42.702 --> 01:50:46.039
PCP IS IS ADDRESSING.

01:50:46.106 --> 01:50:47.540
YEAH I JUST WANT TO AVOID.

01:50:47.607 --> 01:50:49.476
WHAT I SEE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR

01:50:49.542 --> 01:50:51.111
OVER SOMEONE WAKES UP THE DAY

01:50:51.177 --> 01:50:52.846
AFTER THANKSGIVING IS HIS --

01:50:52.912 --> 01:50:53.847
CHRISTMASES IN A MONTH.

01:50:53.913 --> 01:50:57.017
WHERE DO I GET MONEY?

OR FOR INMATES --

01:51:40.126 --> 01:51:42.328
WELL THE COST OF FEEDING AND

01:51:42.395 --> 01:51:44.497
CLOTHING INMATES IS DIRECTLY

01:51:44.564 --> 01:51:45.165
RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF INMATES

01:51:45.231 --> 01:51:45.899
WHO HAVE.

01:51:45.965 --> 01:51:47.333
THE MAINTENANCE THAT THE SYSTEM

01:51:47.400 --> 01:51:49.335
NEEDS IS NOT DIRECTLY RELATED TO

01:51:49.402 --> 01:51:51.171
THE NUMBER OF A INMATES THE

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:52.605
SYSTEM HAS AND SO THAT'S WHAT

01:51:52.672 --> 01:51:54.274
WE'RE PROPOSING TO CHANGE WITH

01:51:54.340 --> 01:51:54.507
THIS --

01:51:54.574 --> 01:51:55.675
METHODOLOGY.

01:51:55.742 --> 01:51:56.776
RISEN MAINTENANCE NEEDS ARE

01:51:56.843 --> 01:51:58.078
FIXED COSTS THAT ARE TIED

01:51:58.144 --> 01:51:59.345
PRIMARILY TO THE NUMBER

01:51:59.412 --> 01:52:01.314
BUILDINGS YOU HAVE THE SIZE AND

01:52:01.381 --> 01:52:02.582

SYSTEM SERVING THOSE BUILDINGS.

01:52:05.785 --> 01:52:06.886
AND THEN THE ELECTRICAL AND

01:52:06.953 --> 01:52:08.521
WATER WASTEWATER SYSTEMS AND AND

01:52:08.588 --> 01:52:10.090
ROADWAY CYSTS.

PARDON THE ROADWAY SYSTEMS

01:52:11.257 --> 01:52:12.559
SERVING THE ENTIRE --

01:52:12.625 --> 01:52:14.327
PRISON CAMPUS --

01:52:14.394 --> 01:52:15.428
THE COST OF MAINTAINING THAT

01:52:15.495 --> 01:52:17.130
HOUSING UNIT OR MEDICAL BUILDING

01:52:17.197 --> 01:52:19.265
DOES NOT FLUCTUATE IF YOU HAVE A

01:52:19.332 --> 01:52:19.833
HUNDRED PEOPLE LIVING THAT

01:52:19.899 --> 01:52:21.801
HOUSING UNIT OR A HUNDRED AND

01:52:21.868 --> 01:52:23.103
TWENTY FIVE OR A HUNDRED FIFTY

01:52:23.169 --> 01:52:24.571
THE MARGINAL CHANGES THERE BUT

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:25.672
THE OVERALL MAINTENANCE IT NEEDS

01:52:25.738 --> 01:52:29.109
TO BE PERFORMED. TO KEEP IT

01:52:29.175 --> 01:52:30.410
OPERATING STAYS THE SAME.

01:52:30.477 --> 01:52:31.711
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES IN THE

01:52:31.778 --> 01:52:33.379
INMATE POPULATION OVER THE LAST

01:52:33.446 --> 01:52:34.681
TEN PLUS YEARS THROUGH

REALIGNMENT AND THE VARIOUS

01:52:36.249 --> 01:52:37.350
PROPOSITIONS THAT WERE DISCUSSED

01:52:37.417 --> 01:52:40.286
IN THE EARLIER A CONVERSATION --

01:52:40.353 --> 01:52:41.187
HAVING THIS FUNDED ON A PER

01:52:41.254 --> 01:52:42.722
INMATE BASIS MEANS THE AMOUNT OF

01:52:42.789 --> 01:52:44.424
FUNDING AVAILABLE TO PERFORM

01:52:44.491 --> 01:52:45.425
THESE ONGOING MAINTENANCE

01:52:45.492 --> 01:52:46.960
FUNCTIONS HAS BEEN REDUCED BY

01:52:47.026 --> 01:52:48.561
ABOUT 33% --

01:52:48.628 --> 01:52:49.129
WENT FROM ABOUT FORTY EIGHT

01:52:49.195 --> 01:52:52.198
MILLION SEVEN TWO WORDS IT'S

01:52:52.265 --> 01:52:53.433
ABOUT THIRTY THREE MILLION RIGHT

01:52:53.500 --> 01:52:55.535
NOW.

01:52:55.602 --> 01:52:57.737
AND THAT'S FOR A PORTFOLIO ABOUT

01:52:57.804 --> 01:52:59.806
FORTY TWO MILLION.

01:52:59.873 --> 01:53:00.140

01:53:00.206 --> 01:53:01.241
SYSTEM WIDE.

01:53:01.307 --> 01:53:02.509
SO WE HAVE FOR SEVERAL YEARS

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:03.877
BEEN WORKING WITH OUR PRISON

01:53:03.943 --> 01:53:05.512
STAFF AND SERVING THEM TO

01:53:05.578 --> 01:53:07.380
IDENTIFY WHAT ARE THE COSTS AT

01:53:07.447 --> 01:53:08.715
YOUR LEVEL --

01:53:08.781 --> 01:53:10.116
THAT WE SHOULD BE EXPANDING IN

01:53:10.183 --> 01:53:11.784
ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE FACILITIES

01:53:11.851 --> 01:53:13.453
THAT THAT YOU'RE OPERATING --

01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:14.888
PART OF THAT WAS LOOKING AT

01:53:14.954 --> 01:53:16.022
MAKING SURE CONTRACTING

01:53:16.089 --> 01:53:17.790
MECHANISMS WERE IN PLACE FOR

FIRE ALARM FIRE SPRINKLER

01:53:18.858 --> 01:53:20.226
MAINTENANCE HIGH VOLTAGE

EQUIPMENT MAINTENANCE --

01:53:21.961 --> 01:53:22.862
NOT ASKING THEM HOW MUCH ARE YOU

01:53:22.929 --> 01:53:24.330
SPENDING THIS YEAR BECAUSE WE

01:53:24.397 --> 01:53:24.931
KNOW THEY'RE NOT SPENDING AS

01:53:24.998 --> 01:53:26.533
MUCH AS SHOULD BE BUT WITH THIS

01:53:26.599 --> 01:53:28.067
CONTRACTING MECHANISMS IN PLACE

01:53:28.134 --> 01:53:30.136
WHAT SHOULD WE BE SPENDING --

01:53:30.203 --> 01:53:31.571
IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE SYSTEMS

01:53:31.638 --> 01:53:32.906
WHAT DO WE NEED N ORDER TO PAY

01:53:32.972 --> 01:53:34.807
OUR REGULATORY FEES TO LOCAL

01:53:34.874 --> 01:53:36.276
AUTHORITIES HAVING JURISDICTION

ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

01:53:37.644 --> 01:53:38.878
AND TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE PARTS

01:53:38.945 --> 01:53:40.413
AND EQUIPMENT FOR ONGOING

01:53:40.480 --> 01:53:42.248
REPLACEMENT OF ITEMS WHEN THEY

01:53:42.315 --> 01:53:44.551
NEED REPAIR OR WHEN THEY'VE

01:53:44.617 --> 01:53:45.185
REACHED THE END OF THEIR USEFUL

01:53:45.251 --> 01:53:46.486
LIFE -- ONE

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:47.954
WE'VE GATHERED INFORMATION BY A

01:53:48.021 --> 01:53:48.988
TO PRISON --

01:53:49.055 --> 01:53:50.657
REVIEWED IT BASED ON THE SQUARE

01:53:50.723 --> 01:53:51.791
FOOTAGE OF EACH PRISON AND

01:53:51.858 --> 01:53:52.926
LOOKED AT IT ON AN AVERAGE

01:53:52.992 --> 01:53:53.593
ACROSS --

01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:56.095
THE ENTIRE SYSTEM IT CAME OUT TO

01:53:56.162 --> 01:53:57.397
ABOUT TWO DOLLARS AND TWENTY

01:53:57.463 --> 01:54:00.433
CENTS PER SQUARE FOOT --

01:54:00.500 --> 01:54:02.969
THAT WAS ALSO COMPARED TO SOME

01:54:03.036 --> 01:54:04.170
EARLY FOR PRISONS BUT FOR THINGS

01:54:04.237 --> 01:54:05.772
LIKE OFFICE BUILDINGS --

01:54:05.838 --> 01:54:07.106
AND TO TWENTY WAS --

01:54:07.173 --> 01:54:08.575
CONSISTENT IN THOSE IN THOSE

01:54:08.641 --> 01:54:09.542
OTHER --

01:54:09.609 --> 01:54:12.712
PUBLICATIONS ALSO SO THIS A B.

01:54:12.779 --> 01:54:14.214
C. P. WAS CALCULATED BASED ON

01:54:14.280 --> 01:54:15.315
THAT TWO DOLLAR AND TWENTY CENTS

01:54:15.381 --> 01:54:17.283
PER SQUARE FOOT AGAINST THE

01:54:17.350 --> 01:54:19.219
FORTY TWO MILLION DOLLAR AYE

01:54:19.285 --> 01:54:20.587
FORTY TWO MILLION SQUARE FEET --

01:54:20.653 --> 01:54:22.555
AREA OF THE OF THE PRISON SYSTEM

01:54:22.622 --> 01:54:24.023
CURRENTLY.

01:54:24.090 --> 01:54:25.425
SO EIGHT WITHIN OVER PHASED

01:54:25.491 --> 01:54:26.926
BASIS OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS

01:54:26.993 --> 01:54:28.494
IT WOULD TAKE OUR FUNDING FROM

01:54:28.561 --> 01:54:29.996
THE THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS

01:54:30.063 --> 01:54:31.397
AT THE CURRENT FORMULA PROVIDES.

01:54:31.464 --> 01:54:32.899
AN INCREASE AT APPROXIMATELY

01:54:32.966 --> 01:54:35.134
EIGHTEEN MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR

01:54:35.201 --> 01:54:37.604
TO EIGHTY NINE MILLION IN TWENTY

01:54:37.670 --> 01:54:39.505
ONE TWENTY TWO AND THEN I'M

01:54:39.572 --> 01:54:40.473
GOING AT THAT LEVEL --

01:54:40.540 --> 01:54:41.874
PLUS THIS PROPOSAL PLACES AT

01:54:41.941 --> 01:54:42.942
FUNDING IN A SEPARATE BUDGET

01:54:43.009 --> 01:54:44.110
ITEM IN ORDER TO ASSURE

01:54:44.177 --> 01:54:45.612
ACCOUNTABILITY --

01:54:45.678 --> 01:54:46.980
REGARDING HOW THE FUNDING IS IS

01:54:47.046 --> 01:54:49.816
SPENT EACH YEAR --

01:54:49.882 --> 01:54:50.683
A TIME BACK TO WE WERE

01:54:50.750 --> 01:54:52.485
DISCUSSING THE KEY HERE IS THAT

01:54:52.552 --> 01:54:53.319
THIS IS GOING TO ALLOW PRESENCE

01:54:53.386 --> 01:54:55.221
COME UP WITH A MULTI YEAR PLANS

01:54:55.288 --> 01:54:56.789
IN ORDER TO BE REPLACING ITEMS.

01:54:56.856 --> 01:54:59.158
AS THEIR FACING THE AT THE END

01:54:59.225 --> 01:55:00.994
OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE RATHER THAN

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:03.229
LEAVING LARGER SCALE PROJECTS

01:55:03.296 --> 01:55:03.963
THAT HAVE TO BE SENT TO

01:55:04.030 --> 01:55:05.131
HEADQUARTERS ON A DEFERRED

01:55:05.198 --> 01:55:06.332
MAINTENANCE BASIS --

01:55:06.399 --> 01:55:07.734
THE EXAMPLE I USED REGARDING

01:55:07.800 --> 01:55:09.402
YOUR HANDLING UNITS IS IS THE

01:55:09.469 --> 01:55:11.804
EXAMPLE THAT I I KEEP USING IN

01:55:11.871 --> 01:55:12.905
HERE THIS WILL ALLOW US TO WORK

01:55:12.972 --> 01:55:14.374
WITH THE INSTITUTIONS WHICH

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.608
RIGHT NOW REALLY LOOK AT THEIR

01:55:15.675 --> 01:55:16.643
MAINTENANCE NEEDS ON A YEAR TO

01:55:16.709 --> 01:55:17.543
YEAR BASIS WHAT I HAVE TO DO

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:18.244
THIS YEAR.

01:55:18.311 --> 01:55:19.679
ESPECIALLY WHEN THE AMOUNT OF

01:55:19.746 --> 01:55:21.481
MONEY THEY GET IS SO LIMITED

01:55:21.547 --> 01:55:23.416
THEY'RE NOT THAT THEY'VE

01:55:23.483 --> 01:55:24.584
UNFORTUNATELY UNTRAINED FROM

01:55:24.651 --> 01:55:26.185
VIEWING IT AS OF THE YEAR A

01:55:26.252 --> 01:55:27.453
MULTI YEAR PROCESS.

01:55:27.520 --> 01:55:29.889
SO THAT'S ONE OF THE ASPECTS OF

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:30.790
THE THREE YEAR IMPLEMENTATION OF

01:55:30.857 --> 01:55:33.059
THIS IT WILL ALLOW US TO WORK

01:55:33.126 --> 01:55:34.627
WITH OUR INSTITUTIONS.

01:55:34.694 --> 01:55:38.798
AND ENSURE THAT WE FUND THESE

01:55:38.865 --> 01:55:40.133
RIGHT OFF THE BAT --

01:55:40.199 --> 01:55:41.668
WITH THE FIRST YEAR AND BEGIN

01:55:41.734 --> 01:55:44.937
HELPING THEM SET PLANS FOR YOUR

01:55:45.004 --> 01:55:45.371
TWO THREE AND FULL

01:55:45.438 --> 01:55:47.373
IMPLEMENTATION TO BEGIN --

01:55:47.440 --> 01:55:49.575
READ REPAIRING THEIR ITEMS AND

01:55:49.642 --> 01:55:51.411
REPLACING THINGS BEFORE THEY

01:55:51.477 --> 01:55:53.279
BECOME A LARGE SCALE DEFERRED

01:55:53.346 --> 01:55:56.749
MAINTENANCE PROJECT --

01:55:56.816 --> 01:55:57.317
YOU SEE THERE'S ANYTHING I

01:55:57.383 --> 01:56:01.220
pTHE CORRELATION IS.

01:56:01.287 --> 01:56:02.155
THIS IS TWO ITEMS TO KEEP

01:56:02.221 --> 01:56:04.324
JUMPING BACK AND FORTH --

01:56:04.390 --> 01:56:06.092
PART OF LOOKING FOR THAT SWEET

01:56:06.159 --> 01:56:07.060
SPOT UNDER FOR MAINTENANCE IS

01:56:07.126 --> 01:56:09.062
ALSO HELPING TO RAMP THIS UP AND

01:56:09.128 --> 01:56:10.897
GETTING THIS IN PLACE THIS OVER

01:56:10.963 --> 01:56:12.965
TIME ONCE IT'S FULLY IMPLEMENTED

01:56:13.032 --> 01:56:15.101
AND AND WE SEE IT GOING FORWARD

01:56:15.168 --> 01:56:16.202
FIVE YEARS FROM THERE.

01:56:16.269 --> 01:56:18.471
WE BELIEVE WILL CERTAINLY REDUCE

01:56:18.538 --> 01:56:20.440
THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE LIST

01:56:20.506 --> 01:56:22.175
AND SO IF WE IT'S A COMBINATION

01:56:22.241 --> 01:56:23.776
OF FIGURING OUT WHAT.

01:56:23.843 --> 01:56:25.211
REDUCTIONS WILL WE SEE FROM THAT

01:56:25.278 --> 01:56:26.779
AND THEN IF WE ARE GOING TO

01:56:26.846 --> 01:56:27.780
INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE

01:56:27.847 --> 01:56:29.449
SPEND EACH YEAR ON DEFERRED

01:56:29.515 --> 01:56:30.516
MAINTENANCE IN ORDER.

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:32.251
TO FULLY ADDRESS THE BACKLOG --

01:56:32.318 --> 01:56:33.119
WE WOULD WANNA MAKE THAT

01:56:33.186 --> 01:56:34.187
DECISION BASED ON THE BILLION

01:56:34.253 --> 01:56:35.788
DOLLARS BECAUSE WE BELIEVE GOING

01:56:35.855 --> 01:56:36.656
FORWARD AFTER FULL

01:56:36.723 --> 01:56:37.790
IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS.

01:56:37.857 --> 01:56:38.958
THAT BILLION DOLLARS WILL FALL

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:41.194
ON THE NATURAL SO IT'S SOMETHING

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:42.428
THAT'S GONNA REQUIRE ONGOING

01:56:42.495 --> 01:56:45.631
STUDY AND AND CONSULTATION TO

01:58:49.388 --> 01:58:52.191
FOCUS THAT WE HAVE SO --

01:58:52.258 --> 01:58:56.329

WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE.

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:21.487
SOME FACILITIES THAT ARE IN FAR

01:59:21.554 --> 01:59:23.089
GREATER.

01:59:23.155 --> 01:59:24.590
NEED IN HEART BIGGER DISREPAIR

01:59:24.657 --> 01:59:26.392
THAN OTHERS AND WE MAY WANT TO

01:59:26.459 --> 01:59:28.895
LOOK AGAIN AT THE ISSUE OF THE

01:59:28.961 --> 01:59:30.329
COST EFFECTIVENESS OF

01:59:30.396 --> 01:59:37.203
INVESTMENTS IN FACILITY THE OKAY

01:59:37.270 --> 01:59:38.237
IF YOU MADE THE BOTTOM.

01:59:38.304 --> 01:59:39.872
EXACTLY.

01:59:39.939 --> 01:59:45.378
I'M YOU MAY PROCEED ON ISSUE.

01:59:45.444 --> 01:59:46.479
FIVE OKAY CERTAINLY AND OUT OF

01:59:46.546 --> 01:59:47.680
HIM TO GIVE A OVERVIEW RATHER

01:59:47.747 --> 01:59:49.415
GOING INTO ANY DEPTH ON ANY ONE

01:59:49.482 --> 01:59:50.616
OF THE PROPOSALS OF COURSE WITH

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:51.617
OUR QUESTIONS --

01:59:51.684 --> 01:59:53.386
WE CAN GO MORE IN DEPTH --

01:59:53.452 --> 01:59:56.355
ON ANY OF THE PROPOSALS --

01:59:56.422 --> 01:59:58.724
SO THE CAPITAL OUTLAY OF ITEM

01:59:58.791 --> 01:59:59.625
FOR ITEM --

01:59:59.692 --> 02:00:01.394
FIVE CONTAINS OF APPROXIMATELY --

02:00:01.460 --> 02:00:01.928
THIRTEEN NEW --

02:00:01.994 --> 02:00:04.163
APPROPRIATIONS APPROXIMATELY

02:00:04.230 --> 02:00:05.798
SEVENTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS --

02:00:05.865 --> 02:00:07.533
AND THREE RE APPROPRIATIONS FROM

02:00:07.600 --> 02:00:09.168
PRIOR YEARS THAT TOTALS

02:00:09.235 --> 02:00:10.903
APPROXIMATELY SIXTEEN MILLION

02:00:10.970 --> 02:00:12.071
DOLLARS.

02:00:12.138 --> 02:00:13.439
OF THAT SEVENTY MILLION A LARGE

02:00:13.506 --> 02:00:15.374
PART OF THAT HAS TO DO WITH --

02:00:15.441 --> 02:00:16.676
HEALTHCARE FACILITIES --

02:00:16.742 --> 02:00:20.012
AT FOR PRISONS SO --

02:00:20.079 --> 02:00:21.347
LAST YEAR'S BUDGET CYCLE FOR

02:00:21.414 --> 02:00:23.049
ADDITIONAL LEASE REVENUE FUNDING

02:00:23.115 --> 02:00:23.950
FOR THE HEALTH CARE FACILITY

02:00:24.016 --> 02:00:26.586
IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM WE LOOK BACK

02:00:26.652 --> 02:00:28.120
AT THE EXISTING HEALTH CARE

02:00:28.187 --> 02:00:29.689
FACILITY IMPROVEMENT PROJECTS.

02:00:29.755 --> 02:00:31.791
AND TO IDENTIFY WHICH ONES --

02:00:31.857 --> 02:00:33.859
WE WERE LOOKING TO MANAGE OUR

02:00:33.926 --> 02:00:35.361
RISK AS FAR AS INCREASED COST

02:00:35.428 --> 02:00:36.762
INCREASE SCHEDULES ON THOSE

02:00:36.829 --> 02:00:37.797
PROJECTS.

02:00:37.863 --> 02:00:39.398
AD THROUGH THAT ANALYSIS WERE

02:00:39.465 --> 02:00:41.667
IDENTIFIED OF FOUR SEPARATE

02:00:41.734 --> 02:00:42.635
PRISONS --

02:00:42.702 --> 02:00:43.402
PROJECTS OF FOUR SEPARATE

02:00:43.469 --> 02:00:45.237
PRISONS THAT EITHER HAD POOR

02:00:45.304 --> 02:00:47.306
PERFORMING CONTRACTORS --

02:00:47.373 --> 02:00:49.075
AND THERE ANY CONSULTANTS --

02:00:49.141 --> 02:00:51.043
EQUALLY MIGHT BE POOR --

02:00:51.110 --> 02:00:52.979
IN AND HAD PROJECTS THAT HADN'T

02:00:53.045 --> 02:00:54.480
STARTED YET THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

02:00:54.547 --> 02:00:56.082
RENOVATIONS AND BUILDINGS THAT

02:00:56.148 --> 02:00:58.150
WERE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE TO SIXTY

02:00:58.217 --> 02:00:58.951
FIVE YEARS OLD --

02:00:59.018 --> 02:01:00.119
OUR EXPERIENCE --

02:01:00.186 --> 02:01:01.387
TO THIS POINT TIME HAS --

02:01:01.454 --> 02:01:03.122
AND LET US TO RECOGNIZE THAT

02:01:03.189 --> 02:01:04.490
WE'RE GOING INTO THESE BUILDINGS

02:01:04.557 --> 02:01:06.692
THAT ARE THAT OLD WE FIND A LOT

02:01:06.759 --> 02:01:07.193
OF ON ANTICIPATED SITE

02:01:07.259 --> 02:01:09.161
CONDITIONS THAT DRIVE ADDITIONAL

02:01:09.228 --> 02:01:11.297
COSTS --

02:01:11.364 --> 02:01:11.931
ESPECIALLY WHEN WE HAVE GENERAL

02:01:11.998 --> 02:01:14.033
CONTRACTORS DO CONSTRUCTION

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:16.268
BULLETINS AND AND NEW DESIGN

02:01:16.335 --> 02:01:17.970
FEATURES FROM THE ANY FIRMS --

02:01:18.037 --> 02:01:18.804
SO -- WE

02:01:18.871 --> 02:01:20.940
MADE THE DECISION TO IN ORDER TO

02:01:21.007 --> 02:01:22.041
GET THE LEAST REVENUE FUNDING TO

02:01:22.108 --> 02:01:24.210
GO FARTHER WITH THE OTHER

02:01:24.276 --> 02:01:25.011
REMAINDER OF THE HEALTH CARE

02:01:25.077 --> 02:01:27.013
PROJECTS WE PULL FOR PROJECTS

OUT AT THESE FOR PRISONS AND

02:01:28.848 --> 02:01:30.316
PROPOSE THEM THROUGH THE BUDGET

02:01:30.383 --> 02:01:31.684
ACT AT TO BE DONE AS A

02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:32.818
COMPLETELY SEPARATE PROJECT

02:01:32.885 --> 02:01:33.052
WOULD.

02:01:33.119 --> 02:01:34.253
NO LONGER BE --

02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:35.321
DRAIN ON ANYWAY ON THE LEASE

02:01:35.388 --> 02:01:36.422
REVENUE FUNDING FOR THE

02:01:38.491 --> 02:01:39.425
HAVE THE WORK DONE BY THE INMATE

02:01:39.492 --> 02:01:41.560

02:01:41.627 --> 02:01:43.362
BEYOND THE ASPECTS OF THE THAT

02:01:43.429 --> 02:01:44.397
PRINTER SHIP IN THE JOB TRAINING

02:01:44.463 --> 02:01:46.465
TO THAT WE HAVE A BETTER ABILITY

02:01:46.532 --> 02:01:47.566
UNDER THE HECK A PROGRAM TO

02:01:47.633 --> 02:01:49.201
CONTROL OUR COSTS WHEN WE'RE

02:01:49.268 --> 02:01:50.803
USING THE IN MAY OR LABOR

02:01:50.870 --> 02:01:52.038

CONTRACTOR.

02:01:52.872 --> 02:01:54.473
IF WE DO RUN INTO DELAYS WE

02:01:54.540 --> 02:01:56.308
DON'T FACE EXTENDED JOB COST

02:01:56.375 --> 02:01:56.909
THAT WE DO WITH GENERAL

02:01:56.976 --> 02:01:58.811
CONTRACTORS AND OUR INMATE WERE

THAT COME FROM THESE PROJECTS --

02:02:06.118 --> 02:02:06.852
BECAUSE MANY OF THESE ARE IN THE

PART OF THE FOR THERE THAT WAS --

02:02:26.472 --> 02:02:27.940

02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:44.710
VARIETY OF NEW BUILDINGS AND

02:09:44.776 --> 02:09:47.112
RENOVATIONS AND COLLEGES BUT CAN

02:09:47.179 --> 02:09:47.846
WE BE SPECIFIC TO THE FOR SOME

02:09:47.913 --> 02:09:51.717
WATER TANKS.

02:09:51.783 --> 02:09:52.918
SO WHEN WE ARE BUILDING THE GUM

02:09:52.985 --> 02:09:54.019
THE BUILDINGS IN THE RENOVATIONS

02:09:54.086 --> 02:09:55.320
AT C. S. P. SACRAMENTO IN FOLSOM

02:09:55.387 --> 02:09:56.855
STATE PRISON --

02:09:56.922 --> 02:09:59.024
THE FIRE MARSHAL IN REVIEWING

02:09:59.091 --> 02:10:00.425
THE PLANS IDENTIFIED THAT THE

02:10:00.492 --> 02:10:01.994
FIRE FLOW REQUIREMENTS NEEDED TO

02:10:02.060 --> 02:10:03.896
BE MET AND THE WAY THE FIRE FLOW

02:10:03.962 --> 02:10:05.130
REQUIREMENTS ARE MEASURED IS

02:10:05.197 --> 02:10:06.999
BASED UPON THE LARGEST SPRINKLER

02:10:07.065 --> 02:10:08.033
BUILDING.

02:10:08.100 --> 02:10:09.635
EVEN THOUGH OUR PROJECT WAS NOT

02:10:09.701 --> 02:10:13.105
BUILDING THAT SMALLER BUILDINGS

02:10:13.172 --> 02:10:14.439
BUT THEY WATER STORAGE

02:10:14.506 --> 02:10:15.974
REQUIREMENT FOR SPRINKLERS WAS

02:10:16.041 --> 02:10:17.309
BASED ON THE LARGEST BUILDING

02:10:17.376 --> 02:10:18.410
WHICH IS --

02:10:18.477 --> 02:10:21.580
WAREHOUSE OF A QUITE SOME SIZE

02:10:21.647 --> 02:10:25.250
AT ALL AT THIS IS THE SACRAMENTO.

02:10:25.317 --> 02:10:26.218
SO THAT'S THE REASON WHY THE

02:10:26.285 --> 02:10:26.818
TANK SEVENTY BUILDERS BECAUSE

02:10:26.885 --> 02:10:28.754
THE FIRE MARSHAL IDENTIFIED A

02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.088
DEFICIENCY IN THE EXISTING

02:10:30.155 --> 02:10:33.959
FACILITY AS FAR AS THE STORAGE

02:10:34.026 --> 02:10:36.728
REQUIREMENT FOR FIRE WATER.

02:10:36.795 --> 02:10:38.530
SO HE WANTS A STORAGE FACILITY

02:10:38.597 --> 02:10:40.566
AS OPPOSED --

02:10:40.632 --> 02:10:42.100
TO OUR FARM WATER --

02:10:42.167 --> 02:10:44.636
FLIGHTS WERE FROM --

02:10:44.703 --> 02:10:46.438
WATERS [inaudible]

02:10:46.505 --> 02:10:48.574
SUPPORT SYSTEM.

02:10:48.640 --> 02:10:50.876
WE HAVE TO BUILD IT.

02:10:50.943 --> 02:10:52.644
IT IS A REASON WHY IS REQUIRING.

02:10:52.711 --> 02:10:53.912
IT IT HAS.

02:10:53.979 --> 02:10:54.813
TO IT THAT'S A QUESTION IT HAD

02:10:54.880 --> 02:10:56.615
IT HAS TO BE ABLE TO PROVIDE A A

02:10:56.682 --> 02:10:58.450
A SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF FLOW FOR A

02:10:58.517 --> 02:11:00.319
SPECIFIC AMOUNT OF TIME AT A

02:11:00.385 --> 02:11:01.119
SPECIFIC --

02:11:01.186 --> 02:11:03.055
GALLONS PER MINUTE AND THE

02:11:03.121 --> 02:11:05.390
EXISTING WATER SERVICE IN FROM

02:11:05.457 --> 02:11:06.959
THE MUNICIPALITY BUT NOT BE ABLE

02:11:07.025 --> 02:11:08.327
TO PROVIDE THAT EVEN IF IT WAS

02:11:08.393 --> 02:11:11.964
SOLELY DEDICATED JUST --

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:14.766
TO JUST TO FIGHTING THAT FIRE.

02:11:14.833 --> 02:11:18.570
OUR WATER CHANGE.

02:11:18.637 --> 02:11:21.473
AND A CERTAIN NUMBER.

02:11:21.540 --> 02:11:24.676
THE WATER PRESSURE THE YES I

02:11:24.743 --> 02:11:25.611
THINK I AM DOING WITHOUT PULLING

02:11:25.677 --> 02:11:26.545
OUT THE DOCUMENT I THINK SOME

02:11:26.612 --> 02:11:27.145
LIKE FOUR THOUSAND GALLONS PER

02:11:27.212 --> 02:11:27.579
MINUTE --

02:11:27.646 --> 02:11:29.648
OVER THE COURSE OF OF TWO HOURS

02:11:29.715 --> 02:11:31.583
OR THREE HOURS.

02:11:31.650 --> 02:11:33.919
AND TIMES A SQUARE FOOT YEAH.

02:11:33.986 --> 02:11:36.255
DON'T HAVE A WELDER.

02:11:36.321 --> 02:11:37.456
NO WE'RE ON MUNICIPAL WATER

02:11:37.522 --> 02:11:38.824
THERE AND IN THERE THEY ALSO

02:11:38.890 --> 02:11:39.591
REQUIRE --

02:11:39.658 --> 02:11:41.360
THE PROJECT TO SHOW HOW THAT

02:11:41.426 --> 02:11:43.528
WATER IS MAINTAINED AT ALL TIMES

02:11:43.595 --> 02:11:45.130
SO IF YOU HAVE A TANK AND YOU

02:11:45.197 --> 02:11:46.598
HAVE A DAILY FLUCTUATION OF YOUR

02:11:46.665 --> 02:11:47.866
WATER USAGE YOU NEED TO BE ABLE

02:11:47.933 --> 02:11:48.900
TO SHOW HOW THAT DAILY

02:11:48.967 --> 02:11:50.068
FLUCTUATION STILL.

02:11:50.135 --> 02:11:53.005
ALWAYS LEAVES THEIR FIRE REQUIRE

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.207
THE CODE REQUIRED AMOUNT IN.

02:11:55.274 --> 02:11:57.509
WHAT YOU JUST DESCRIBED?

02:11:57.576 --> 02:11:58.577
WAS NOT TANKS.

02:11:58.644 --> 02:12:00.078
THAT ARE NECESSARY FOR DAILY

02:12:00.145 --> 02:12:01.813
WATER USAGE YOU JUST DESCRIBED

02:12:01.880 --> 02:12:04.416
TANKS THAT HAD TO BE NECESSARY

02:12:04.483 --> 02:12:07.286
FOR THE SHOW YES BUT BECAUSE

02:12:07.352 --> 02:12:08.020
THEY HAVE ANY NOT YELLOW.

02:12:08.086 --> 02:12:09.855
THERE ARE NOW THAT COVERS OUR

02:12:09.921 --> 02:12:10.922
DAILY WATER USAGE BUT RIGHT

02:12:10.989 --> 02:12:13.525
NOBODY HAS OCCURRED.

02:12:13.592 --> 02:12:15.360
YOU ARE BUILDING NEW TANK. FOR

02:12:15.427 --> 02:12:16.662
THIS PURPOSE WHAT THE NINE

02:12:16.728 --> 02:12:19.298
MILLION IS YES SO WHY WOULD THEY

02:12:19.364 --> 02:12:21.400
NEED NEED TO BE.

02:12:21.466 --> 02:12:25.404
I THANKS THAT WOULD ALSO SUPPLY

02:12:25.470 --> 02:12:27.005
FOR THE DAILY WATER USED.

02:12:27.072 --> 02:12:28.373
I APOLOGIZE I MISSTATED A

02:12:28.440 --> 02:12:29.608
MANAGER A WHERE WAS SAYING IS A

02:12:29.675 --> 02:12:30.242
REASON WE'RE BUILDING NEW TAXES

02:12:30.309 --> 02:12:31.243
BECAUSE OUR EXISTING TANK DOES

02:12:31.310 --> 02:12:33.312
NOT ALLOW FOR THE CAPACITY THE

02:12:33.378 --> 02:12:35.314
NECESSARY WITH THE DAILY HAS OF

02:12:35.380 --> 02:12:36.481
THE DAILY WITH RIGHT BECAUSE OF

02:12:36.548 --> 02:12:39.551
THE DAILY USAGE THESE NEW TANKS

02:12:39.618 --> 02:12:40.085
OR JUST TO COVER THE FIRE.

02:12:40.152 --> 02:12:40.519
FLOW REQUIREMENTS.

02:12:40.585 --> 02:12:41.887
IN WAS THERE ANY DISCUSSION WITH

02:12:41.953 --> 02:12:43.588
THE FIRE MARSHALL AS TO HOW

02:12:43.655 --> 02:12:46.058
THERE MIGHT BE.

02:12:46.124 --> 02:12:48.460
ACCOMMODATION FOR THE WAREHOUSE.

02:12:48.527 --> 02:12:52.831
SEPARATELY FROM THE CUSTODIAL

02:12:52.898 --> 02:12:54.766
FACILITY.

02:12:54.833 --> 02:12:57.235
OF WE ARE PRESENT HAVE NOT BEEN

02:12:57.302 --> 02:13:01.006
BUILT WITH SEPARATE FIRE FLOW --

02:13:01.073 --> 02:13:02.307
A FIVE FIGHT ESSENTIALLY ONE

02:13:02.374 --> 02:13:03.942
SINGLE WATER SYSTEM THAT'S OUR

02:13:04.009 --> 02:13:05.177
THAT THAT THAT'S THE OBVIOUSLY

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:06.645
AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE BUILDING

02:13:06.712 --> 02:13:08.680
NEW BUT STILL YOU ARE CLEARLY

02:13:08.747 --> 02:13:10.549
CONNECTING THESE WATER TAKES SO.

02:13:10.615 --> 02:13:13.785
DID YOU CONSIDER AND ENTERTAIN

02:13:13.852 --> 02:13:14.086
[inaudible]

02:13:14.152 --> 02:13:18.090
A A SEPARATE SOURCE.

02:13:18.156 --> 02:13:19.224
FOR THE WAREHOUSE VISIT YOU'VE

02:13:19.291 --> 02:13:21.259
DESCRIBED THAT YOU MUST HAVE

02:13:21.326 --> 02:13:23.428
THIS LARGER ARE LARGER ASK

02:13:23.495 --> 02:13:24.162
BECAUSE OF THE SQUARE FOOTAGE

02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:25.230
WAREHOUSE FACILITY.

02:13:25.297 --> 02:13:28.533
WHICH YES WILL HAVE PEOPLE BUT

02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:29.735
NOT LIKE.

02:13:29.801 --> 02:13:31.436
THE LADY TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SO

02:13:31.503 --> 02:13:32.270
WAS THERE.

02:13:32.337 --> 02:13:34.005
ANY NEGOTIATIONS WITH FIRE

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:35.707
MARSHAL AROUND.

02:13:35.774 --> 02:13:37.642
SOME DIFFERENTIATION HERE THAT

02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:41.713
MIGHT THEN REDUCE OUR COSTS.

02:13:41.780 --> 02:13:43.348
I I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION AND

02:13:43.415 --> 02:13:44.282
I DON'T HAVE THE DETAILS IN

02:13:44.349 --> 02:13:45.917
FRONT OF ME AT THIS TIME SO I'LL

02:13:45.984 --> 02:13:47.452
GO BACK AND AND RESEARCH THAT

02:13:47.519 --> 02:13:49.421
WITH THE PROJECT TEAM AND QUE.

02:13:49.488 --> 02:13:50.822
RESPOND BACK THROUGH THE CONCERT.

02:13:50.889 --> 02:13:51.890
IS I MEAN CLEARLY WHAT YOU

02:13:51.957 --> 02:13:54.793
DESCRIBED AS A THE WATER TANKS --

02:13:54.860 --> 02:13:55.894
BECAUSE I'M LOOKING AT NINE

02:13:55.961 --> 02:13:57.462
MILLION FOR SOME WATER TANKS AND

02:13:57.529 --> 02:13:58.363
I'M THINKING.

02:13:58.430 --> 02:14:00.232
THOSE ARE PRETTY CADILLAC BUT

02:14:00.298 --> 02:14:01.566
DEPENDING ON THE CAPACITY MAYBE

02:14:01.633 --> 02:14:03.368
NOT BUT THEN AGAIN MAYBE THE

02:14:03.435 --> 02:14:05.003
CAPACITY DOESN'T HAVE TO BE

02:14:05.070 --> 02:14:05.771
QUITE.

02:14:05.837 --> 02:14:07.272
CERTAINLY WE NEED TO ACHIEVE THE

02:14:07.339 --> 02:14:09.307
OBJECTIVE OF THE FIRE MARSHAL

02:14:09.374 --> 02:14:09.941
BUT MAYBE THERE'S OTHER WAYS TO

02:14:10.008 --> 02:14:11.810
ACHIEVE IT.

02:14:11.877 --> 02:14:13.311
I'M UNDERSTOOD WHEN WE GO BACK

02:14:13.378 --> 02:14:14.813
AND RESEARCH THAT AND WE WILL UP

02:14:14.880 --> 02:14:16.214
RIGHT INFORMATION BACK TO THE

02:14:16.281 --> 02:14:16.515
COMMITTEE.

02:14:16.581 --> 02:14:19.551
SENATOR BELT BACK TO YOU OF SODA

02:14:19.618 --> 02:14:19.851
[inaudible]

02:14:19.918 --> 02:14:26.892
YES.

02:14:26.958 --> 02:14:28.593
IS -- FOR

02:14:28.660 --> 02:14:51.950
FOR AND YES [inaudible]

02:14:52.017 --> 02:14:55.887
SO WHAT [inaudible]

02:14:55.954 --> 02:15:00.759
CERTAINLY.

02:15:00.826 --> 02:15:04.763
SO.

02:15:04.830 --> 02:15:07.265
ONE ONE IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A A

02:15:07.332 --> 02:15:08.834
THREE TIER HOUSING UNIT USED

02:15:08.900 --> 02:15:10.202
AGAIN FOR ADMINISTRATIVE

02:15:10.268 --> 02:15:12.404
SEGREGATION AND IT HAS OPENED

02:15:12.471 --> 02:15:14.306
BARRED CELL FRONTS SO THE

02:15:14.372 --> 02:15:15.073
ABILITY.

02:15:15.140 --> 02:15:16.041
AND YOU KNOW TO THE YOU THE

02:15:16.107 --> 02:15:16.808
ABILITY --

02:15:16.875 --> 02:15:17.843
TO EITHER PUT --

02:15:17.909 --> 02:15:19.678
STAFF OR IN IN MAY THAT MAY BE

02:15:19.744 --> 02:15:21.446
ESCORTING PASS ANOTHER INMATE

02:15:21.513 --> 02:15:23.982
CELL AND RISK IS VERY VERY MUCH

02:15:24.049 --> 02:15:25.584
A IN AT RISK --

02:15:25.650 --> 02:15:26.585
FOR ANY SORT OF ATTACKS WHILE

02:15:26.651 --> 02:15:28.053
YOU'RE WALKING PAST --

02:15:28.119 --> 02:15:29.821
THE THE LONG TEAR SO IN ORDER TO

02:15:29.888 --> 02:15:31.756
ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM HERE AND IT

02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:33.725
AT OTHER PRISONS --

02:15:33.792 --> 02:15:35.227
WE REPLACE THE BARD CELL FRONT

02:15:35.293 --> 02:15:37.028
WITH SALAS ALL FRONTS --

02:15:37.095 --> 02:15:37.629
IT INCLUDES --

02:15:37.696 --> 02:15:40.098
ADDITIONAL VISION PANELS --

02:15:40.165 --> 02:15:44.736
AND THE VENTILATION SYSTEM THE

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:47.138
SERVICE OF THE THIS THE CELLS

02:15:47.205 --> 02:15:48.039
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW IT'S BASED

02:15:48.106 --> 02:15:50.308
UPON AIR FLOW THROUGH THE BARS

02:15:50.375 --> 02:15:51.109
AND FORCE WHEN YOU PUT THE SOLID

02:15:51.176 --> 02:15:52.310
OR THERE YOU'VE GOT TO MAKE SURE

02:15:52.377 --> 02:15:54.112
THAT YOU'RE GETTING THE PROPER

02:15:54.179 --> 02:15:54.679
AIR FLOW THROUGH.

02:15:54.746 --> 02:15:57.249
US ALSO AGREED THE BUILDING --

02:15:57.315 --> 02:15:58.116
TO INCLUDE --

02:15:58.183 --> 02:15:59.618
FIRE ALARM A FIRE SPRINKLERS

02:15:59.684 --> 02:16:01.586
WHICH MAY NOT WE'RE NOT CODE

02:16:01.653 --> 02:16:02.354
REQUIRED AT THE TIME THE

02:16:02.420 --> 02:16:03.622
BUILDING WAS.

02:16:03.688 --> 02:16:05.257
ORIGINALLY CONSTRUCTED BUT IS

02:16:05.323 --> 02:16:07.459
REQUIRED TO THE LEVEL OF

02:16:07.526 --> 02:16:08.093
RENOVATION WILL BE DOING IN THIS

02:16:08.159 --> 02:16:12.464
ROOM.

02:16:12.531 --> 02:16:18.303
IN THE WORLD.

02:16:18.370 --> 02:16:19.104
NOT A CONDITION BUT BUT BUT

02:16:19.170 --> 02:16:21.273
EVAPORATIVE COOLING --

02:16:21.339 --> 02:16:23.842
YES VILLAGE.

02:16:23.909 --> 02:16:25.343
OUR FIRE ALARM FIRE SPRINKLER

02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:32.150
UPGRADES [inaudible]

02:16:32.217 --> 02:16:36.888
I INDEED.

02:16:36.955 --> 02:16:38.423
ONE I AM I FEAR THAT ANY

02:16:38.490 --> 02:16:39.491
COMPARISON WOULD BE APPLES AND

02:16:39.558 --> 02:16:40.625
ORANGES BECAUSE THAT NEW CELL

02:16:40.692 --> 02:16:41.993
WOULD BE BUILDING BUILDING THAT

02:16:42.060 --> 02:16:43.695
GOES ALONG WITH IT --

02:16:43.762 --> 02:16:45.697
SO I HAVEN'T DONE THE MATH ON

02:16:45.764 --> 02:16:47.265
THIS ONE WE NEVER LOOKED AT IT

02:16:47.332 --> 02:16:49.701
ON A ON A PER CELL.

02:16:49.768 --> 02:16:53.171
PURCELL COST.

02:16:53.238 --> 02:16:55.774
I'M NOT MORE MONEY BUT INCLUDING

02:16:55.840 --> 02:16:56.942
IN SCOPE I BELIEVE THE LIGHTING

02:16:57.008 --> 02:16:58.843

02:18:08.413 --> 02:18:09.814
YEAR -- RE

02:18:09.881 --> 02:18:11.383
PURPOSING SOME YARDS AT PELICAN

02:18:11.449 --> 02:18:12.751
BAY [inaudible]

02:18:12.817 --> 02:18:15.320
GIVEN -- OUR

02:18:15.387 --> 02:18:19.324
INTENT -- TO

02:18:19.391 --> 02:18:20.925
BRING POPULATION OUT OF STATE

02:18:20.992 --> 02:18:24.062
INTO STATE AND KEEPING OUR

02:18:24.129 --> 02:18:26.031
POPULATION NUMBERS DOWN IN THE

02:18:26.097 --> 02:18:28.566
OTHER THE LADIES THAT ARE PASSED

02:18:28.633 --> 02:18:31.069
OR CLOSE TO THEIR CAP

02:18:31.136 --> 02:18:31.369
[inaudible]

02:18:31.436 --> 02:18:33.138
I'M.

02:18:33.204 --> 02:18:36.074
BUT IN CONTEXT OF OUR DISCUSSION

02:18:36.141 --> 02:18:37.342
EARLIER.

02:18:37.409 --> 02:18:43.448
AROUND OUR REQUIREMENT TO ENSURE

02:18:43.515 --> 02:18:44.549
THAT WE ARE PROVIDING.

02:18:44.616 --> 02:18:46.751
THE APPROPRIATE.

02:18:46.818 --> 02:18:48.820
AND CONSISTENT OR COMPARABLE

02:18:48.887 --> 02:18:50.655
REHABILITATIVE PROGRAMS IN ALL

02:18:50.722 --> 02:18:51.523
OF OUR YARDS IN ALL OF OUR

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:53.124
FACILITIES.

02:18:53.191 --> 02:18:55.326
AND HOW SOME LEVEL OF THOSE ARE

02:18:55.393 --> 02:18:57.562
DEPENDENT ON COMMUNITY MOMENT

02:18:57.629 --> 02:18:59.197
VOLUNTEERS AND SUCH.

02:18:59.264 --> 02:19:00.565
WHEN WE LOOK AT FACILITIES LIKE

02:19:00.632 --> 02:19:02.133
PELICAN BAY?

02:19:02.200 --> 02:19:04.869
THAT ARE VERY REMOTE AND NOT

02:19:04.936 --> 02:19:06.705
NEAR POPULATION CENTERS WE ALSO

02:19:06.771 --> 02:19:11.209
KNOW THAT OUR ABILITY. TO

02:19:11.276 --> 02:19:13.945
SUCCEED IN THOSE ASPECTS.

02:19:14.012 --> 02:19:17.248
OF IS DIFFICULT IS HARDER.

02:19:17.315 --> 02:19:21.186
AND SO I HAVE TO LOOK AT AS WE

02:19:21.252 --> 02:19:22.854
THINK ABOUT IT COMMITTING

02:19:22.921 --> 02:19:24.155
EXPENDITURES OF FUNDS.

02:19:24.222 --> 02:19:28.026
WHETHER WE AND AGAIN AS WE LOOK

02:19:28.093 --> 02:19:29.527
AT WHERE WE'RE GOING TO PUT

02:19:29.594 --> 02:19:31.629
POPULATION IN WE WE PUTTING

02:19:31.696 --> 02:19:32.897
POPULATION.

02:19:32.964 --> 02:19:34.632
AT FACILITIES WHERE WE KNOW WE

02:19:34.699 --> 02:19:35.567
CAN.

02:19:35.633 --> 02:19:37.469
PROVIDE THE ADEQUATE REHAB

02:19:37.535 --> 02:19:40.505
BECAUSE WE HAVE ACCESS TO EITHER

02:19:40.572 --> 02:19:42.006
THE EDUCATIONAL.

02:19:42.073 --> 02:19:44.008
INSTITUTIONS OR OTHER AND I'M

02:19:44.075 --> 02:19:45.710
NOT TALKING JUST VOLUNTEERED WE

02:19:45.777 --> 02:19:48.346
HAVE THAT PRO PROPER --

02:19:48.413 --> 02:19:50.215
ACCESS WHICH WE MAY NOT IN SOME

02:19:50.281 --> 02:19:51.783
OF THE REMOTE FACILITIES SO

02:19:51.850 --> 02:19:52.917
AGAIN DOESN'T REQUIRE COMMENT

02:19:52.984 --> 02:19:54.919
BUT IT'S CERTAINLY A LENS THAT

02:19:54.986 --> 02:19:56.588
I'M GONNA BE LOOKING AT IN OUR

02:19:56.654 --> 02:19:58.089
EXPENDITURES.

02:19:58.156 --> 02:20:00.725

ADDITIONALLY THE CURRENT S. UT

02:28:36.274 --> 02:28:38.442
TREATMENT MODEL USED BY DR P. IS

02:28:38.509 --> 02:28:40.244
NOT BASED ON A MEDICAL CHRONIC

IS ONLY FIVE MONTHS AND CURRENT

02:28:55.226 --> 02:28:56.927

THROUGHOUT THE CONTINUUM OF CARE.

GREATER OPPORTUNITY TO ENSURE

02:31:59.210 --> 02:32:00.277
ASSUME.

02:32:00.344 --> 02:32:02.580
IN YOUR ROLE THAT IT'S YOUR JOB

02:32:02.646 --> 02:32:03.814
TO WORK YOURSELF OUT OF THAT JOB.

02:32:03.881 --> 02:32:04.949
AND I'M JUST WONDERING HOW

02:32:05.015 --> 02:32:07.818
THAT'S WORKING.

02:32:07.885 --> 02:32:08.752
FOR WELL --

02:32:08.819 --> 02:32:10.120
AS I'VE INDICATED WE MADE

02:32:10.187 --> 02:32:11.589
SUBSTANTIAL PROGRESS IN THE

02:32:11.655 --> 02:32:14.124
DELEGATIONS ARE WE'RE DOWN TO OF

02:32:14.191 --> 02:32:16.660
THE LAST REMAINING MOST

02:32:16.727 --> 02:32:17.862
DIFFICULT INSTITUTIONS.

02:32:17.928 --> 02:32:20.064
NOW I HAVE A LASER FOCUS ON

02:32:20.130 --> 02:32:22.700
COMPLETING THAT TASK I THINK

02:32:22.766 --> 02:32:24.134
THINGS ARE GOING [inaudible]

02:32:24.201 --> 02:32:26.504
REASONABLY WELL.

02:32:26.570 --> 02:32:28.072
I WOULD HAVE PREFERRED.

02:32:28.138 --> 02:32:29.473
FRANKLY THAT THESE LAST

02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:30.808
INSTITUTIONS WOULD HAVE BEEN

02:32:30.875 --> 02:32:33.777
ABLE TO IMPROVE THEMSELVES --

02:32:33.844 --> 02:32:36.213
USING ALL THE TOOLS AND POLICIES

02:32:36.280 --> 02:32:38.682
AND PROCEDURES WE PUT IN PLACE

02:32:38.749 --> 02:32:40.251
JUST AS OF THE OTHERS.

02:32:40.317 --> 02:32:41.685
THEY HAVE PROVEN TO BE MORE

02:32:41.752 --> 02:32:44.655
RESISTANT TO IMPROVEMENTS.

02:32:44.722 --> 02:32:46.090
AND FRANKLY WHAT WE ARE DOING

02:32:46.156 --> 02:32:48.859
RIGHT NOW IS TRYING TO DIAGNOSE.

02:32:48.926 --> 02:32:51.028
WHAT'S THE PROBLEM.

02:32:51.095 --> 02:32:52.930
BECAUSE WE KNOW THE TOOLS THAT

02:32:52.997 --> 02:32:54.999
WE HAVE IN PLACE WORK.

02:32:55.065 --> 02:32:56.700
IT'S JUST ARE NOT WORKING OF

02:32:56.767 --> 02:32:58.135
THOSE INSTITUTIONS.

02:32:58.202 --> 02:32:59.603
AND AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S A

02:32:59.670 --> 02:33:01.906
REALLY COMPLEX CHALLENGE.

02:33:01.972 --> 02:33:04.275
OF THE FIGURE OUT WELL WHY

02:33:04.341 --> 02:33:06.243
HASN'T WORKED AND THEN ONCE THE

02:33:06.310 --> 02:33:07.444
APPROPRIATE SOLUTION TO THAT

02:33:07.511 --> 02:33:09.079
PROBLEM.

02:33:09.146 --> 02:33:10.214
SO I'M THAT'S WHY I REMAIN

02:33:10.281 --> 02:33:11.582
OPTIMISTIC THAT I'M GOING TO

02:33:11.649 --> 02:33:13.284
CONTINUE.

02:33:13.350 --> 02:33:14.552
IN THE DIRECTION OF WORKING

02:33:17.955 --> 02:33:21.292
I CAN INFER THAN THAT IS MAYBE A

02:33:21.358 --> 02:33:22.993
SQUARE PEG IN A ROUND HOLE

02:33:23.060 --> 02:33:26.063
VERSES INSUBORDINATION.

02:33:26.130 --> 02:33:26.497
I DON'T BELIEVE IT'S

02:33:26.564 --> 02:33:27.531

02:34:17.748 --> 02:34:18.949
IT WAS SO NICE.

02:34:19.016 --> 02:34:20.317
THEY GO INTO A LOCAL HEALTHCARE

02:34:20.384 --> 02:34:22.553
SYSTEMS --

02:34:22.620 --> 02:34:24.221
THOSE RECORDS ARE KEY TO PROVIDE

02:34:24.288 --> 02:34:25.956
GOOD.

02:34:26.023 --> 02:34:26.924

PART OF THE REASON THAT.

02:34:45.209 --> 02:34:48.379
WE MADE THE DECISION LAST YEAR --

02:34:48.445 --> 02:34:49.513
TO TO GO MUCH BROADER

02:34:49.580 --> 02:34:49.813
[inaudible]

02:34:49.880 --> 02:34:51.915

PUTTING TOGETHER AN ESSENTIALLY

02:34:55.052 --> 02:34:56.654
AN IMPLEMENTATION PLAN FOR HOW

02:34:56.720 --> 02:34:59.089
WE WOULD ROLL THIS OUT BECAUSE

02:34:59.156 --> 02:35:00.591
IT'S A VERY BIG PROGRAM.

02:35:00.658 --> 02:35:02.493
I'M AND WE DON'T WANT TO TRY TO

02:35:02.559 --> 02:35:04.428
IMPLEMENT TOO MUCH.

02:35:04.495 --> 02:35:07.431
ALL AT ONCE M. STUMP.

02:35:07.498 --> 02:35:10.367
THE FOCUS OF OUR FIRST AVERAGE

02:35:10.434 --> 02:35:12.036
IS GOING TO BE ON MAKING SURE

02:35:12.102 --> 02:35:13.937
THAT INMATES AS THE INITIALLY

02:35:14.004 --> 02:35:15.372
COME INTO THE SYSTEM WHO ARE

02:35:15.439 --> 02:35:16.540
ALREADY ON SOME FORM OF

02:35:16.607 --> 02:35:17.941
TREATMENT.

02:35:18.008 --> 02:35:19.610
THERE WE MAINTAIN CONTINUITY OF

02:35:19.677 --> 02:35:20.811
THAT TREE.

02:35:20.878 --> 02:35:21.578
WHICH WE HAVE NOT REALLY

02:35:21.645 --> 02:35:23.380
PREVIOUSLY DOT.

02:35:23.447 --> 02:35:25.816
SECOND WE'RE MOST INTERESTED IN

02:35:25.883 --> 02:35:27.584
CATCHING PEOPLE WHO ARE ABOUT TO

02:35:27.651 --> 02:35:29.219
BE RELEASED.

02:35:29.286 --> 02:35:30.387
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE GET TO

02:35:30.454 --> 02:35:32.356
THEM EARLY ENOUGH SO THAT THEY

02:35:32.423 --> 02:35:34.591
CAN GET INTO AN OF THE

02:35:34.658 --> 02:35:36.927
CONDITIONS OF THE PROGRAM.

02:35:36.994 --> 02:35:39.096
SO AT THE TIME OF RELEASE OF

02:35:39.163 --> 02:35:39.697
WHAT WE'VE DONE AS MUCH AS WE

02:35:39.763 --> 02:35:42.099
CAN.

02:35:42.166 --> 02:35:43.767
I'M WILL SO WE'LL START OF THOSE

02:35:43.834 --> 02:35:45.502
ENDS AND THEN OF A GRADUALLY

02:35:45.569 --> 02:35:47.504
MOVE TOWARDS OF BUILDING THE

02:35:47.571 --> 02:35:50.240
PROGRAM OUT TO ALL INMATES THE

02:35:50.307 --> 02:35:51.375
GROUP IN THE MIDDLE.

02:35:51.442 --> 02:35:53.610
IN TERMS OF THE U. COORDINATION --

02:35:53.677 --> 02:35:54.778
AT THE TIME OF RELEASE THAT

02:35:54.845 --> 02:35:56.513
OBVIOUSLY IS CRITICAL.

02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:58.315
IN OTHER OF THIS YOU KNOW THERE

02:35:58.382 --> 02:35:59.717
ARE A LOT OF ISSUES YOU HAVE TO

02:35:59.783 --> 02:36:01.618
WORK WITH TO TRY TO MAKE SURE

02:36:01.685 --> 02:36:03.554

02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:05.055
AFTER RELEASED.

02:36:05.122 --> 02:36:06.924
SOMEBODY ACTUALLY GETS IN FRONT

02:36:06.990 --> 02:36:10.260
OF A PROVIDER IN THE COUNTY.

02:36:10.327 --> 02:36:12.496
AND THAT THE TRANSITION IS VERY

02:36:12.563 --> 02:36:15.399
LOS.

02:36:15.466 --> 02:36:16.500
ILLEGAL PROVIDERS WITH ONE WE

02:36:16.567 --> 02:36:17.501
WANT TO GET IN FRONT OF THE

02:36:17.568 --> 02:36:19.002
PROVIDERS THAT WE ARE

02:36:19.069 --> 02:36:20.571
COORDINATING.

02:36:20.637 --> 02:36:21.205
NOW.

02:36:21.271 --> 02:36:22.573
THE GOOD NEWS ON THAT FRONT WITH

02:36:22.639 --> 02:36:25.109
THE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORD --

02:36:25.175 --> 02:36:27.311
WE NOW ARE AT A POINT --

02:36:27.377 --> 02:36:29.179
WE RECEIVED ALIVE BELIEVE IT'S

02:36:29.246 --> 02:36:29.780
CORRECT TO SAY IT'S A

02:36:29.847 --> 02:36:31.648
CERTIFICATION BUT WE ARE AT A

02:36:31.715 --> 02:36:33.450
POINT WHERE WE ARE ABLE NOW TO

IN A LOS ANGELES COUNTY WHERE

02:36:53.537 --> 02:36:54.872
WE'VE BEEN DOING THIS WITH

02:36:54.938 --> 02:36:56.440
RESPECT TO MENTAL HEALTH RECORDS

02:36:56.507 --> 02:36:57.508
FOR SOME TIME.

02:36:57.574 --> 02:36:59.243

THE DETAILS OF THIS BUT I

02:37:29.840 --> 02:37:30.941
BELIEVE WE WE HAVE HAD TO DO

02:37:31.008 --> 02:37:32.476
SOMETHING TO BECOME FULLY HIPPA

02:37:32.543 --> 02:37:35.078
COMPLIANT SO WE CAN DO THAT HAND

OUR OF FOLKS CURRENTLY IN OUR

02:44:32.562 --> 02:44:34.331
STATE PRISONS HAVE AN OPIOID USE

02:44:34.397 --> 02:44:35.832

NOW IF THAT.

02:44:38.168 --> 02:44:39.536
WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS

02:44:39.603 --> 02:44:42.172
IF THERE ARE NOT BEING PROVIDED

02:44:42.239 --> 02:44:44.174

NO LONGER UTILIZING THE DRUG.

02:44:53.984 --> 02:44:55.051
THEN THAT MEANS THEY ARE THAT WE

02:44:55.118 --> 02:45:00.056

AND THAT WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE.

02:45:07.931 --> 02:45:11.201
PUT ON A GOOD DEAL OF NEW

02:45:11.268 --> 02:45:13.303
INVESTMENT TO TRY TO DO DRUG

02:45:13.370 --> 02:45:15.672
INTERDICTION --

02:45:15.739 --> 02:45:16.973
WOULD APPEAR THAT.

02:45:17.040 --> 02:45:19.276
WELL MAYBE IT'S HAD A LITTLE

02:45:19.342 --> 02:45:20.443
IMPACTED WOULD CERTAINLY

02:45:20.510 --> 02:45:21.778
INDICATE NOT MUCH.

02:45:21.845 --> 02:45:23.380
AND CERTAINLY WITH --

02:45:23.446 --> 02:45:25.315

WHAT'S THOUGHT THERE WOULD BE.

02:45:38.128 --> 02:45:39.562
WHETHER A BROADER USE OF

02:45:39.629 --> 02:45:41.998
MEDICALLY ASSISTED TREATMENT

02:45:42.065 --> 02:45:42.299
[inaudible]

02:45:42.365 --> 02:45:44.267
MIGHT.

02:45:44.334 --> 02:45:46.069
BE MORE EFFECTIVE THAN MOST OF

02:45:46.136 --> 02:45:48.004
OUR DRUG INTERDICTION PROGRAMS.

02:45:48.071 --> 02:45:49.673
AND I ASKED THAT ON A COUPLE

02:45:49.739 --> 02:45:50.640
LEVELS [inaudible]

02:45:50.707 --> 02:45:53.410
ONE PLEASE ME.

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:56.513

02:45:59.649 --> 02:46:01.484
THE USE OF LIKE IF I'M AN OPIOID

02:46:01.551 --> 02:46:01.885
ADDICT.

AND I AM UNDER MEDICAL ASSISTED

02:46:04.054 --> 02:46:06.690
TREATMENT DOES THAT PRETTY MUCH

02:46:06.756 --> 02:46:07.791
DO I STILL.

02:46:07.857 --> 02:46:10.260
DOES THAT NEGATE MY DESIRE TO

02:46:10.327 --> 02:46:13.029
THEN FIND THE ILLEGAL SUBSTANCE

02:46:13.096 --> 02:46:15.865
OR DO I STILL HAVE THAT CRAVING.

02:46:15.932 --> 02:46:17.867
SO IN OTHER WORDS AND THAT'S ONE

02:46:17.934 --> 02:46:18.535
QUESTION AND THEN THE SECOND ONE

02:46:18.601 --> 02:46:19.402

AM ON THE MEDICALY ASSISTED.

02:46:32.449 --> 02:46:37.020
DOES THAT ENHANCE MY OVERDOSE OF

02:46:37.087 --> 02:46:40.023
POTENTIAL OR SO IF YOU COULD

02:46:40.090 --> 02:46:44.561
JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE.

02:46:44.627 --> 02:46:50.300

INITIAL QUESTION CAN THIS BE

02:47:05.715 --> 02:47:06.082
MORE SUCCESSFUL THAN

02:47:06.149 --> 02:47:08.618
INTERDICTION.

02:47:08.685 --> 02:47:10.120
YES I THINK IT CAN BE A BECAUSE

02:47:10.186 --> 02:47:11.988
INTERDICTION UP HAS NOT YET

02:47:12.055 --> 02:47:13.490
WORKED.

ON THE THE INTENTION HERE IS

02:47:16.993 --> 02:47:18.395

TO HAVE RESOURCES THAT WILL

02:47:20.063 --> 02:47:22.132

THANK YOU MY MEDICAL RESOURCES

02:47:28.538 --> 02:47:30.407
HAVE A RIDE.

02:47:30.473 --> 02:47:32.842
THE IT IT'S A COMPLEX QUESTION

02:47:32.909 --> 02:47:35.879
FRANKLY WHETHER --

02:47:35.945 --> 02:47:37.547
YOU KNOW AS A GENERAL MATTER THE

02:47:37.614 --> 02:47:39.816
MEDICATION ASSISTED THERAPY --

02:47:39.883 --> 02:47:42.318
ELIMINATE --

02:47:42.385 --> 02:47:43.653
CONSISTENTLY THE CRAVING.

02:47:43.720 --> 02:47:44.788
THE THE THE REASON IT'S A

02:47:44.854 --> 02:47:46.289
COMPLEX --

02:47:46.356 --> 02:47:49.259
QUESTION AND THE ANSWER THERE'S

02:47:49.325 --> 02:47:51.094
NOT A SINGLE DRUG THAT YOU USE

02:47:51.161 --> 02:47:53.763
THERE ARE VARIATIONS DEPENDING

02:47:53.830 --> 02:47:55.398
UPON THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE

02:47:55.465 --> 02:47:56.599
PARTICULAR PATIENT.

02:47:56.666 --> 02:47:57.600
A WHAT'S MEDICALLY APPROPRIATE

02:47:57.667 --> 02:47:59.402
FOR THEM.

02:47:59.469 --> 02:48:01.237
IN ADDITION OF THE MEDICATION OF

02:48:01.304 --> 02:48:03.106
THESE PROGRAMS REALLY DON'T WORK

02:48:03.173 --> 02:48:04.274
UNLESS YOU HAVE SUCCESSFUL

02:48:04.340 --> 02:48:07.210
COGNITIVE BEHAVIORAL THERAPY. TO

02:48:07.277 --> 02:48:09.012
CHANGE BEHAVIOR.

02:48:09.078 --> 02:48:10.513
BECAUSE OF THE END OF THE DAY IF

02:48:10.580 --> 02:48:12.215
SOMEBODY DECIDES.

02:48:12.282 --> 02:48:13.950
I'M DON'T WANT TO CONTINUE THIS

02:48:14.017 --> 02:48:15.251
PROGRAM I'D RATHER JUST TAKE THE

02:48:15.318 --> 02:48:16.820
DRUGS.

02:48:16.886 --> 02:48:19.022
THAT'S WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN.

02:48:19.088 --> 02:48:20.990
IN IN THE PRISONS YOU HAVE AN

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:22.892
ENVIRONMENT I THINK RIGHT NOW

02:48:22.959 --> 02:48:25.462
WHERE IT'S PROBABLY EVEN MORE

02:48:25.528 --> 02:48:26.596
THAN JUST THE DRUGS ARE

02:48:26.663 --> 02:48:28.698
AVAILABLE.

02:48:28.765 --> 02:48:31.301
DRUGS ARE BEING PUSHED ON PEOPLE.

02:48:31.367 --> 02:48:32.402
IN THERE'S SOME FEAR AND

02:48:32.469 --> 02:48:34.771
INTIMIDATION TO GET PEOPLE.

02:48:34.838 --> 02:48:37.340
TO BUY DRUGS.

02:48:37.407 --> 02:48:40.543
BECAUSE THIS IS A YOU.

02:48:40.610 --> 02:48:43.246
MONEY IS BEING MADE OFF OF THIS.

02:48:43.313 --> 02:48:45.381
SO WE ANTICIPATE.

02:48:45.448 --> 02:48:46.916
THAT EVEN ARE BEING AS EFFECTIVE

02:48:46.983 --> 02:48:49.219
YOU CAN BE WITH THESE PROGRAMS

02:48:49.285 --> 02:48:49.786
OF THIS IS TRUE AROUND THE

02:48:49.853 --> 02:48:50.687
COUNTRY.

02:48:50.753 --> 02:48:52.655
THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL

02:48:52.722 --> 02:48:52.956
[inaudible]

02:48:53.022 --> 02:48:57.160
ALWAYS [inaudible] FOR RELAPSE.

02:48:57.227 --> 02:48:59.195
AND THERE THERE DOES COME A

02:48:59.262 --> 02:49:00.163
CYCLE WHERE SOMEBODY WILL

02:49:00.230 --> 02:49:01.698
RELAPSE AND THEN YOU TRY TO GET

02:49:01.764 --> 02:49:02.999
HIM BACK ON THE PROGRAM.

02:49:03.066 --> 02:49:04.400
BUT IT IT'S NOT SOMETHING WHERE

02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:06.236
YOU HAVE --

02:49:06.302 --> 02:49:09.772
YOU CAN PREDICT.

02:49:09.839 --> 02:49:11.541
A 100% SUCCESS.

02:49:11.608 --> 02:49:13.443
BY WAY OF COMPARISON WELL AS YOU

02:49:13.510 --> 02:49:14.344
ALL KNOW WE WE HAD ASKED THE

02:49:14.410 --> 02:49:16.112
LEGISLATURE AND RECEIVE SUPPORT

02:49:16.179 --> 02:49:18.915
FOR OUR HABSI A PROGRAM.

02:49:18.982 --> 02:49:21.017
WELL THAT'S ONE WE'RE WE'RE

02:49:21.084 --> 02:49:22.952
PROBABLY ONE OF THE MOST

02:49:23.019 --> 02:49:23.720
SUCCESSFUL.

02:49:23.786 --> 02:49:25.488
I HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS IN THE

02:49:25.555 --> 02:49:27.423
STATE IN TERMS OF IF SOMEBODY'S

02:49:27.490 --> 02:49:29.859
ON THAT PROGRAM THEY ARE NOT.

02:49:29.926 --> 02:49:31.728
A RE CONTRACTING --

02:49:31.794 --> 02:49:34.163
Là CONDITION [inaudible]

02:49:34.230 --> 02:49:36.165
ARMED.

02:49:36.232 --> 02:49:37.267
THAT'S ONE WHERE THERE IS YOU'RE

02:49:37.333 --> 02:49:38.701
GIVEN THE PILLS YOU'VE GOT THE

02:49:38.768 --> 02:49:41.037
TWELVE WEEK OR EIGHT WEEKS SEEK

02:49:41.104 --> 02:49:42.572
ONCE YOUR GET A CURE.

02:49:42.639 --> 02:49:45.174
THIS IS MUCH MORE LIKE CHRONIC

02:49:45.241 --> 02:49:46.142
CONDITIONS.

02:49:46.209 --> 02:49:50.046
WHERE IT REQUIRES THE?

02:49:50.113 --> 02:49:50.880
IN GAUGE WANT.

02:49:50.947 --> 02:49:53.283
OF THE PATIENT.

02:49:53.349 --> 02:49:55.451
AND WE ALL KNOW WITH CHRONIC

02:49:55.518 --> 02:49:57.453
CONDITIONS --

02:49:57.520 --> 02:49:58.788
DIABETES.

02:49:58.855 --> 02:50:00.089
AND AM I GONNA TAKE MY PILLS IN

02:50:00.156 --> 02:50:02.425
MY GOING TO REDUCE Y DIET MY

02:50:02.492 --> 02:50:04.694
GOING TO EXERCISE --

02:50:04.761 --> 02:50:06.829
RELAPSE RATES ARE SIGNIFICANT.

02:50:06.896 --> 02:50:08.264
SO -- PART

02:50:08.331 --> 02:50:09.966
OF THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE IN THIS

02:50:10.033 --> 02:50:11.434
IS I THINK SOMETHING THAT WE

02:50:11.501 --> 02:50:12.302
NEED -- TO

02:50:12.368 --> 02:50:12.936
IN OUR OWN PLANNING AND

02:50:13.002 --> 02:50:16.873
CONVERSATION LEGISLATURE.

02:50:16.940 --> 02:50:18.441
WE NEED TO ESTABLISH SOME.

02:50:18.508 --> 02:50:21.711
I'M REALISTIC EXPECTATIONS OF

02:50:21.778 --> 02:50:23.713
WHAT THIS CAN ACCOMPLISH.

02:50:23.780 --> 02:50:27.216
BECAUSE IT'S NOT GONNA BE A 100%.

02:50:27.283 --> 02:50:29.018
IT'S GOING TO BE LESS THAN.

02:50:29.085 --> 02:50:29.953
AND THAT IS ONE OF THE THINGS

02:50:30.019 --> 02:50:31.287
THAT I'VE ASKED STAFF IN

02:50:31.354 --> 02:50:32.789
CONSULTING WITH NATIONAL EXPERTS

02:50:32.855 --> 02:50:36.059
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

02:50:36.125 --> 02:50:38.127
WHAT WE'RE GETTING FOR THIS SORT

02:50:38.194 --> 02:50:39.295
OF AN INVESTMENT?

02:50:39.362 --> 02:50:40.663
WILL PRESS FOR FOR THE DOCTOR

02:50:40.730 --> 02:50:42.231
ANSWERS THE QUESTION THE OTHER

02:50:42.298 --> 02:50:44.133
PORTION OF MY QUESTION.

02:50:44.200 --> 02:50:46.302
IS OUR OF THIS TWENTY SIX

02:50:46.369 --> 02:50:47.870
THOUSAND PEOPLE.

02:50:47.937 --> 02:50:49.672
ARE THEY CONCENTRATED IN CERTAIN

02:50:49.739 --> 02:50:50.206
THE FACILITIES COMPARED TO

02:50:50.273 --> 02:50:51.441
OTHERS.

02:50:51.507 --> 02:50:53.610
OR IS THIS PRETTY MUCH EQUALLY

02:50:53.676 --> 02:50:55.912
DISTRIBUTED ACROSS ALL OF OUR

02:50:55.979 --> 02:50:57.547
THIRTY SOME ODD [inaudible]

02:50:57.614 --> 02:51:00.049
PRISON FACILITY.

02:51:00.116 --> 02:51:01.551
I BELIEVE THAT I DON'T THINK

02:51:01.618 --> 02:51:03.386
IT'S JUST EQUALLY.

02:51:03.453 --> 02:51:05.288
I THINK THERE ARE CONCENTRATIONS.

02:51:05.355 --> 02:51:07.090
BUT IT IS AT ALL THIRTY FIVE

02:51:07.156 --> 02:51:08.758
OKAY SO IF IT'S ALL THIRTY FIVE

02:51:08.825 --> 02:51:11.427
BUT YOU COULD GIVE US.

02:51:11.494 --> 02:51:12.295
AND AGAIN YOU KNOW I HAVE TO DO

02:51:12.362 --> 02:51:14.263
IT VERBALLY NOW THAT YOU COULD.

02:51:14.330 --> 02:51:15.264
PROVIDE US.

02:51:15.331 --> 02:51:17.600
I'M WHICH FACILITIES PERHAPS

02:51:17.667 --> 02:51:19.235
WERE HAS A HIGHER CONCENTRATION.

02:51:19.302 --> 02:51:21.270
SO THAT WE AT LEAST AN HOUR

02:51:21.337 --> 02:51:24.073
APPROACHING HOW TO DEAL WITH

02:51:24.140 --> 02:51:25.575
THIS WE HAVE SOME SENSE.

02:51:25.642 --> 02:51:27.043
RIGHT MAYBE ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT

02:51:27.110 --> 02:51:28.177
ALL.

02:51:28.244 --> 02:51:29.612
YEAH WE WILL BE ABLE TO PROVIDE

02:51:29.679 --> 02:51:31.581
YOU WITH SOME DATA POINTS WILL

02:51:31.648 --> 02:51:33.049
SUGGEST WHERE THERE ARE HIGHER

02:51:33.116 --> 02:51:35.952
CONCENTRATIONS OF PROBLEM.

02:51:36.019 --> 02:51:38.187
AFTER ONLY REASON AFTER WE MATCH

02:51:38.254 --> 02:51:39.255
WOMEN TO HAPPEN IF YOU CAN GIVE

02:51:39.322 --> 02:51:41.157
ME A NUMBER OF TWENTY SIX

02:51:41.224 --> 02:51:41.858
THOUSAND AND YOU MEANS YOU'RE

02:51:41.924 --> 02:51:45.395
TRACKING TO SOME DEGREE SO YOU

02:51:45.461 --> 02:51:46.963
HAVE SOME SENSE OF WHERE THE

02:51:47.030 --> 02:51:48.164
CAMERA AROUND I WILL ADMIT MUCH

02:51:48.231 --> 02:51:51.000
OF MUCH OF THE INFORMATION WE

02:51:51.067 --> 02:51:53.503
HAVE ON THE TWENTY SIX ON

02:51:53.569 --> 02:51:54.137
UNIVERSITY.

02:51:54.203 --> 02:51:54.804
OF CALIFORNIA BERKELEY IT'S AN

02:51:54.871 --> 02:51:57.040
ESTIMATE OKAY BECAUSE WE HAVEN'T

02:51:57.106 --> 02:51:59.709
BEEN FROM A ON THE MEDICAL SIDE.

02:51:59.776 --> 02:52:01.978
WE DON'T COUNT.

02:52:02.045 --> 02:52:03.880
THROUGH SCREENING THOSE PEOPLE.

02:52:03.946 --> 02:52:05.882
OF THAT WILL BE SOMETHING THAT

02:52:05.948 --> 02:52:07.550
THE THROUGH THE AS WE BEGIN

02:52:07.617 --> 02:52:08.751
IMPLEMENTATION.

02:52:08.818 --> 02:52:09.719
WILL START TO GET MUCH BETTER

02:52:09.786 --> 02:52:12.021
DATA ABOUT WHAT THE NUMBERS ARE

02:52:12.088 --> 02:52:14.057
AND WHERE THEY ARE BUT WE HAVE

02:52:14.123 --> 02:52:14.957
SOME ESTIMATES --

02:52:15.024 --> 02:52:16.125
WE CAN LOOK AT WHERE THE

02:52:16.192 --> 02:52:18.428
OVERDOSE A NUMBER OF OVERDOSE IS

02:52:18.494 --> 02:52:20.363
ARE THERE SOME INFORMATION WE

02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:22.198
HAVE AND WILL PROVIDE THAT TO

02:52:22.265 --> 02:52:23.032
THE COMMITTEE.

02:52:23.099 --> 02:52:24.333
AND THEN ON THE QUESTION OF

02:52:24.400 --> 02:52:25.835
WHETHER --

02:52:25.902 --> 02:52:27.470
IF I'M ON MEDICALLY ASSISTED

02:52:27.537 --> 02:52:31.240
TREATMENT AND THEN I USE THE

02:52:31.307 --> 02:52:32.642
WHETHER HEROIN OR FELT NO ALERT

02:52:32.709 --> 02:52:35.244
IS MY LIKELIHOOD OF OVERDOSE

02:52:35.311 --> 02:52:35.978
INCREASE.

02:52:36.045 --> 02:52:41.984
AND AND JUST THOSE MEDICAL PART.

02:52:42.051 --> 02:52:44.187
IT DEPENDS ON HOW WE'RE TREATING

02:52:44.253 --> 02:52:46.622
THE THE PATIENT AND WHAT'S RIGHT

02:52:46.689 --> 02:52:47.457
AND WHAT DRUGS ARE USED AYE I'M

02:52:47.523 --> 02:52:48.725
DOCTOR THIRD I'M DIRECTOR OF

RECEIVER --

02:52:52.095 --> 02:52:53.596
LET'S TALK ABOUT BUPRENORPHINE

02:52:53.663 --> 02:52:55.465
WHICH IS THE DRUG THATIS MOST

02:52:55.531 --> 02:52:57.366
EFFECTIVE IN WILL BE THE MAIN

02:52:57.433 --> 02:52:59.202
STATE DRUG WE WILL BE USING WILL

OF FROM AN ILLICIT OBTAIN

02:53:46.849 --> 02:53:49.018
SUBSTANCE.

02:53:49.085 --> 02:53:51.654
THE DRUG BECAUSE IT HAS NEXT

02:53:51.721 --> 02:53:53.189
ANTAGONISE PROPERTIES.

02:53:53.256 --> 02:53:55.024
IT IS POSSIBLE TO GET A LETHAL

02:53:55.091 --> 02:53:56.726
OVERDOSE OF FENTANYL I MEAN THE

THAT NOW WE'RE ACTUALLY DEALING

02:54:01.330 --> 02:54:03.132
WITH FENNEL ANALOGUES WHICH ARE

02:54:03.199 --> 02:54:05.234
EVEN MORE POTENT THAN MEN FENNEL

02:54:05.301 --> 02:54:06.636
YOU CAN GET INTO SOME OF THESE

02:54:06.702 --> 02:54:07.003
DRUGS.

02:54:07.069 --> 02:54:10.406
THAT ARE TEN THOUSAND TIMES AS

02:54:10.473 --> 02:54:13.776
POTENT AS REGULAR FENTANYL ABOVE

02:54:13.843 --> 02:54:16.212
THE I'M OUT OVER MORPHINE SO IT

02:54:16.279 --> 02:54:18.581
IS POSSIBLE FOR YOU --

02:54:18.648 --> 02:54:20.216
TO TO HAVE A LETHAL OVERDOSE

02:54:20.283 --> 02:54:21.884
WHILE YOU WERE ON BUPRENORPHINE

02:54:21.951 --> 02:54:23.052
HOWEVER IT IS MUCH MORE

02:54:23.119 --> 02:54:24.520
DIFFICULT TO DO.

02:54:24.587 --> 02:54:27.423
BUT AS AS A RECEIVER POINTED OUT.

02:54:27.490 --> 02:54:28.724
YOU ALSO HAVE TO CONSIDER THE

02:54:28.791 --> 02:54:30.660
ENVIRONMENT WITH WHICH WE WILL

02:54:30.726 --> 02:54:32.662
BE PRESCRIBING THIS MEDICATION.

02:54:32.728 --> 02:54:34.931
AND SO THE MOTIVATION OF AN

02:54:34.997 --> 02:54:36.899
INDIVIDUAL PATIENT TO TO OBTAIN

02:54:36.966 --> 02:54:38.801
ILLICIT DRUGS IS GOING TO BE

02:54:38.868 --> 02:54:40.570
DEPENDENT ON THE ENVIRONMENT

02:54:40.636 --> 02:54:41.470
THEY ARE IN.

02:54:41.537 --> 02:54:43.172
AND AS WAS POINTED OUT THERE IS

02:54:43.239 --> 02:54:44.740
SOME QUARTERS IN FOR SEEN YEAH

02:54:44.807 --> 02:54:46.976
THERE IS A LARGE TRADE.

02:54:47.043 --> 02:54:49.612
IN THESE DRUGS WITH IN THE

02:54:49.679 --> 02:54:51.113
PRISON SYSTEM --

02:54:51.180 --> 02:54:54.851
THROUGHOUT THE SYSTEM IN SPITE

02:54:54.917 --> 02:54:56.886
IN TERMS OF INTERDICTION BEING A

02:54:56.953 --> 02:55:00.289
LESS EFFECTIVE --

02:55:00.356 --> 02:55:02.892
STRATEGY AND THAT'S NO DIFFERENT

02:55:02.959 --> 02:55:03.559
REALLY THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE

02:55:03.626 --> 02:55:05.027
WORLD NEIL INTERDICTION

02:55:05.094 --> 02:55:06.729
STRATEGIES HAVE BEEN EMPLOYED

02:55:06.796 --> 02:55:08.931
WITH VARYING DEGREES OF SUCCESS.

02:55:08.998 --> 02:55:09.899
SO THE QUESTION YOU'RE REALLY

02:55:09.966 --> 02:55:13.002
ASKING IS HOW QUICKLY CAN WE GET

02:55:13.069 --> 02:55:14.770
TO THIS MIDDLE GROUP OF PEOPLE.

02:55:14.837 --> 02:55:16.105
WE'RE TAKING THE HIGHEST GROUP

02:55:16.172 --> 02:55:17.506
YOU KNOW THE PEOPLE COMING AND

02:55:17.573 --> 02:55:19.041
WE'RE CONTINUE THE MEDICATIONS

02:55:19.108 --> 02:55:23.846
ARE ON WAS.

02:55:23.913 --> 02:55:25.281
THE GROUP THIS LEAVING WHICH IS

02:55:25.348 --> 02:55:26.716
ABSOLUTELY KEY BECAUSE A SENATOR

02:55:26.782 --> 02:55:29.485
BELL POINTED OUT IT'S NOT TWO

02:55:29.552 --> 02:55:30.720
WEEKS IS TO DATE.

02:55:30.786 --> 02:55:32.288
YOU KNOW THAT THE OVER THE OVER

02:55:32.355 --> 02:55:34.323
DOSE RATE YOU KNOW IS ANYWHERE

02:55:34.390 --> 02:55:36.959
BETWEEN DEATH THE IS WITHIN

02:55:37.026 --> 02:55:38.427
SEVENTY TWO HOURS RELEASE.

02:55:38.494 --> 02:55:40.563
SO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT A

02:55:40.630 --> 02:55:44.066
HAND IN GLOVE TRANSFER TO FIFTY

02:55:44.133 --> 02:55:45.201
EIGHT DIFFERENT COUNTIES WITH

02:55:45.268 --> 02:55:45.968
FIFTY EIGHT DIFFERENT WAYS OF

02:55:46.035 --> 02:55:47.603
DOING THINGS AND FIFTY EIGHT

02:55:47.670 --> 02:55:48.804
DIFFERENT LEVELS OF RESOURCE.

02:55:48.871 --> 02:55:51.274
THOSE WILL BE OUR FOCUS AND THEN

02:55:51.340 --> 02:55:52.575
AS WE MOVE INTO HIS MIDDLE

02:55:52.642 --> 02:55:53.910
GROUP WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON

02:55:53.976 --> 02:55:56.512
OUR HIGHEST RISK PATIENTS FIRST.

02:55:56.579 --> 02:55:58.514
AND THAT LARGELY IS A GROUP THAT

02:55:58.581 --> 02:56:00.516
IS ALREADY ATTEMPTED OVERDOSE

02:56:00.583 --> 02:56:01.550
INNER HAS SURVIVED.

02:56:01.617 --> 02:56:02.818
I IS THE HIGHEST GROUP.

02:56:02.885 --> 02:56:04.353
THE GROUP THAT IS CURRENTLY

02:56:04.420 --> 02:56:05.521
UNDERGOING HEPATITIS C.

02:56:05.588 --> 02:56:07.189
TREATMENT BECAUSE THEY GENERALLY

02:56:07.256 --> 02:56:08.524
GOT THEIR DISEASE FROM

02:56:08.591 --> 02:56:10.927
INTRAVENOUS DRUG USE AND WE'RE

02:56:10.993 --> 02:56:12.628
SPENDING LARGE SUMS OF MONEY ON

02:56:12.695 --> 02:56:15.064
THEM WE ACTUALLY HAVE VERY SAD

02:56:15.131 --> 02:56:16.399
CASES NOW WE'RE WE HAVE CURED

02:56:16.465 --> 02:56:20.002
PEOPLE THEIR HEPATITIS C..

02:56:20.069 --> 02:56:20.503
ONLY SEE AND DIVERT DRUG

02:56:20.569 --> 02:56:22.371
OVERDOSE.

02:56:22.438 --> 02:56:23.839
ARM SO THOSE WILL BE THE GROUP'S

02:56:23.906 --> 02:56:25.441
WILL FOCUS ON AND WILL FOCUS

02:56:25.508 --> 02:56:26.809
SAID A SET OF OF HUBS WILL SHOW

02:56:26.876 --> 02:56:28.711
YOU ALL THE IMPLEMENTATION

02:56:28.778 --> 02:56:30.246
THINGS WE'VE GOT BUT YOU KNOW AS

02:56:30.313 --> 02:56:32.014
FAR AS WE KNOW NO ONE IS TEMPTED

02:56:32.081 --> 02:56:33.249
THIS ON THIS SCALE.

02:56:33.316 --> 02:56:35.484
SO WE'RE GONNA LEARN AS WE GO ON

02:56:35.551 --> 02:56:36.552
WE'VE GOT OUR BEST IDEAS WE

02:56:36.619 --> 02:56:38.187
ALLOW REAL SMART PEOPLE IN THE

02:56:38.254 --> 02:56:39.488
ROOM THAT GIVEN THIS ADVICE BOTH

02:56:39.555 --> 02:56:41.924
INTERNAL EXTERNAL CDC ARE.

02:56:41.991 --> 02:56:43.125
BUT WE'RE GONNA WE'RE GONNA HAVE

02:56:43.192 --> 02:56:45.161
TO BE INFORMED WITH OUR INITIAL

02:56:45.227 --> 02:56:46.028
ROLE LOTS OF WHAT HAPPENS FROM

NOW DONE OUTSIDE OF PRISON

02:57:40.516 --> 02:57:42.051
ENVIRONMENT TRYING TO COMPARE.

02:57:42.118 --> 02:57:43.919
THE RELATIVE RISK BENEFITING

02:57:43.986 --> 02:57:46.622
COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE LONG

INITIATE THERAPY IN THE

02:58:06.375 --> 02:58:07.710
EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT BEFORE

02:58:07.777 --> 02:58:09.211
THEY'VE EVER MADE CONTACT WITH

03:00:57.680 --> 03:01:01.784
OF IT ITEMS MATCHING IT'S LIKE

03:01:01.850 --> 03:01:04.119
OUR HEALTH INSURANCE OR MET YOU

03:01:04.186 --> 03:01:05.754
KNOW WE SEE THOSE CHARTS AND

03:01:05.821 --> 03:01:07.590
THEY SHOW US THAT --

03:01:07.656 --> 03:01:09.825
THE AVERAGE COST FOR PROVISION

03:01:09.892 --> 03:01:11.193
OF HEALTH CARE FOR THE WHOLE

03:01:11.260 --> 03:01:12.995
POPULATION IS X. BUT IT'S

03:01:13.062 --> 03:01:16.865
CONCENTRATED 480% IT'S ONLY THIS.

03:01:16.932 --> 03:01:19.735
AND FOR IF YOU KNOW 5% IT'S THAT

03:01:19.802 --> 03:01:22.304
NO OTHER FIVE IT'S THIS AND

03:01:22.371 --> 03:01:22.671
ANOTHER.

03:01:22.738 --> 03:01:24.006
SO WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO SEE IS

03:01:24.073 --> 03:01:25.774
THAT KIND OF BREAK DOWN AND THEN

03:01:25.841 --> 03:01:28.677
WITHIN THAT PERHAPS AGE OR OTHER

03:01:28.744 --> 03:01:30.246
CHARACTERISTICS.

03:01:30.312 --> 03:01:34.550
SO THAT WE CAN THEN LOOK AT I'M.

03:01:34.617 --> 03:01:36.919
NO OBVIOUSLY THE RECEIVERS DRIVE

03:01:36.986 --> 03:01:38.621
IS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE

03:01:38.687 --> 03:01:40.289
PROVIDING.

03:01:40.356 --> 03:01:41.991
THE ADEQUATE HEALTH CARE FOR

03:01:42.057 --> 03:01:44.026
THOSE PEOPLE THAT WE ARE HOLDING

03:01:44.093 --> 03:01:44.893
WITH THAT WE ARE INCARCERATED

03:01:44.960 --> 03:01:47.263
WHAT WHAT.

03:01:47.329 --> 03:01:49.231
WHAT I FEEL PART OF OUR JOB IS

03:01:49.298 --> 03:01:51.267
BESIDES MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE

03:01:51.333 --> 03:01:53.402
DOING THINGS WITH QUALITY AND

03:01:53.469 --> 03:01:54.770
ACCORDING TO THE LAW?

03:01:54.837 --> 03:01:56.639
IS ALSO TO MONITOR OUR GENERAL

03:01:56.705 --> 03:01:59.975
FUND EXPENDITURES AND SO IF WE

03:02:00.042 --> 03:02:00.175
HAVE.

03:02:00.242 --> 03:02:06.915
A A RATHER SMALL POPULATION OF

03:02:06.982 --> 03:02:08.751
INDIVIDUALS THAT WE ARE.

03:02:08.817 --> 03:02:09.485
HOLDING.

03:02:09.551 --> 03:02:12.421
THAT ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR A VERY

03:02:12.488 --> 03:02:14.657
SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR

03:02:14.723 --> 03:02:16.358
HEALTH YOUR BOSS.

03:02:16.425 --> 03:02:18.494
WE MAY WANT TO THINK ABOUT WHAT

03:02:18.560 --> 03:02:20.329
OTHER OPTIONS WE HAVE.

03:02:20.396 --> 03:02:22.197
AGAIN.

03:02:22.264 --> 03:02:24.533
I'M WHAT I'M CARTON IS ENOUGH IS

03:02:24.600 --> 03:02:27.403
THAT WHEN WE LOOK AT OUR ENTIRE

03:02:27.469 --> 03:02:29.505
CDC OUR BUDGET ONE OF THE

03:02:29.571 --> 03:02:31.974
LARGEST JUMPS IN THE LAST COUPLE

03:02:32.041 --> 03:02:33.375

03:02:33.442 --> 03:02:35.010
IN TERMS OF OUR EXPENDITURES HAS

03:02:35.077 --> 03:02:36.979
BEEN.

03:02:37.046 --> 03:02:38.781
THE HEALTH CARE PORTION SO IT

03:02:38.847 --> 03:02:40.516
MAKES SENSE THAT WE WOULD HAVE

03:02:40.582 --> 03:02:43.085
THAT JUMP BECAUSE OF THE WORK

03:02:43.152 --> 03:02:43.852
ORDER.

03:02:43.919 --> 03:02:46.622
ON THE OTHER HAND AS I HAVE SAID

03:02:46.689 --> 03:02:48.490
IN OTHER --

03:02:48.557 --> 03:02:50.292
IN EACH ITEM THAT WE TALK ABOUT.

03:02:50.359 --> 03:02:52.628
EVERY BIT OF INCREASE IN GENERAL

03:02:52.695 --> 03:02:54.596

03:02:54.663 --> 03:02:56.131
WITHIN THE CDC OUR BUDGET.%

03:02:56.198 --> 03:03:00.336
IS LESS GENERAL FUND ANY OTHER

03:03:00.402 --> 03:03:03.572
STATE.

03:03:03.639 --> 03:03:04.673
SO WE CAN GET THAT BREAK DOWN

03:03:04.740 --> 03:03:05.908
YES MA'AM SURE HAPPY TO PROVIDE

03:03:05.974 --> 03:03:06.975

03:03:07.042 --> 03:03:08.777
ANALYSIS ABOUT.

03:03:08.844 --> 03:03:10.479

03:03:10.546 --> 03:03:11.647
