SEAFOOD PROVIDERS FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK AT THE ANNUAL SEAFOOD RECEPTION THAT WE HEAR. THAT WE HOST TRADITIONALLY THE NIGHT BEFORE THIS FORM- THAT SAID BECAUSE OF THE PANDEMIC WE COULDN'T HOST THAT AMAZING SHOWCASE OF GOLDEN STATE SEAFOOD BROWNING SO HERE'S TO HOPING IN TWENTY TWENTY TWO THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO. GATHER IN PERSON AGAIN AND ENJOY ALL ASPECTS OF THAT TRADITION. NONE THE LESS THE SUM THIS MORNING WE ARE PLEASED TO WELCOME ALL MEMBERS OF THE FLEET IN FISHERY REPRESENTATIVES AND COMMUNITY. MEMBERS TUNING IN FROM EVERY CALL OF THIS GREAT. TO CALIFORNIA TODAY. FOR FORTY EIGHT YEARS EACH OF CALIFORNIA'S FISHERY SPECIFIC COMMITTEES ORGANIZATIONS. ASSOCIATIONS COUNCILS AND MOST IMPORTANTLY OUR FISHERMEN AND WOMEN. ARE HERE TO BE TO PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA AN ANNUAL REPORT ON THEIR NEEDS THEIR GOALS. A YEARLY ACTIVITIES AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS YEAH THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT SINCE LAST YEAR'S FISHERIES FORUM. OUR STATE'S FISHERIES HAVE BEEN THROUGH A LOT AND THAT IS TO SAY. IT'S AN UNDERSTATEMENT NOT LONG AFTER WE GATHERED IN MARCH THE FLEET SCRAMBLE TO ENSURE THAT OUR FISHERIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS AN ESSENTIAL INDUSTRY DURING COLBERT. CONTINUED TO PROVIDE FOR OUR CRITICAL FOOD SUPPLY. AND THAT'S TO BE HONEST LAST YEAR'S DUNGEONS CRAB SEASON. IT WAS BLEAK OR IN THE MIDDLE OF A DESTRUCTIVE AND COSTLY OIL SPILL IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. AND OF COURSE CATASTROPHIC DROUGHT AND SIGNIFICANT WATER OVER USE LED TO DISASTROUS CONSEQUENCES FOR OUR SALMON FISHERIES. INTERSTATES IN NOW OUR SEATS THE SEAFOOD INDUSTRY MAY HAVE BENT. BUT IT DID NOT BREAK. OUT TODAY IN SPITE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE WE'RE GONNA LOOK TOWARDS THE FUTURE. AND HOW WE CAN WORK TOGETHER TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM SUCCESS OF THE FLEET. HOW WE CAN ENSURE THE LONG TERM SURVIVAL OF ENDANGERED SALMON SPECIES AND HOW WE CAN INVEST IN THE COASTAL COMMUNITIES WHO. DEPEND ON THRIVING FISHERIES FOR THEIR LIVELIHOODS. IN THAT VEIN OVER THE LAST YEAR WE'VE BEEN ACTIVE ENGAGE OVER THE PAST YEAR WITH EACH AND EVERYONE OF YOU FROM THE DUNGEONS CRAB FLEET ALONG WITH PROCESSORS WORKING WITH. FISH AND WILDLIFE REPRESENTATIVES ON SPECIFIC REGULATORY CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE DUNGEONS CAPTURING. I WILL BE GETTING A FULL BRIEFING TODAY ON THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE DUNGENESS CRAB SEASON. AS YOU KNOW DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF WHALES. THIS SEASON SOUTH OF MENDOCINO COUNTY ALONG WITH THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA. IS CURRENTLY DELAYED THAT AS A DELAYED OPENING. AREAS SOUTH OF MONTEREY IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN ON NOVEMBER FIFTEENTH. EVERYTHING NORTH AND MENDOCINO COUNTY IS. ANTICIPATED OPEN ON DECEMBER FIRST. FIRST AS A BEFORE. WE'VE BEEN DEEPLY INVOLVED WITH SEVERAL CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS DURING THIS CATASTROPHIC DROUGHT FOCUSED ON SAVING YOUR STATE'S ENDANGERED SALMON SPECIES THIS PAST JULY THIS COMMITTEE HELD A HEARING ON DROUGHT LOW FLOWS AND CANDIDLY DEAD SALMON WE HEARD FROM TRIBAL LEADERS ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERS AND FISHERMEN THAT THAT THAT INTEGRATED WATER MANAGEMENT POLICIES WAS LITERALLY KILLING CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC SALMON RUNS WE LEARNED THAT IT WAS POTENTIALLY POSSIBLE. THAT WE WOULD LOSE ALL ENDANGERED WINTER RUN EGGS THIS SUMMER ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER AND THE WORST CASE SCENARIO HAS PLAYED OUT ACCORDING TO THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE 80% WINTER RUN. WE'RE LIKELY COOKED TO DEATH ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. AND WE ARE NOW HEARING THAT ADDITIONAL 18% OF THE REMAINING 20% JUVENILE SALMON PERISHED DUE TO HIGH WATER TEMPERATURES. THAT MEANS THAT WE ONLY HAVE 2% SURVIVAL RATE FOR THE WINTER RUN SALMON ON THE SACRAMENTO. NOW THIS IS WORSE THAN WHAT WE SAW IN TWO PREVIOUS DEVASTATING YEARS IN DOES THIS MEAN- AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA HEAR THIS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND I AM GRATEFUL TO THE DIRECTOR WHO HAS BEEN WORKING TO BE ABLE TO GET OUT IN FRONT OF THIS CRISIS. WHAT WE'RE HEARING IS FOR CONTINUING TO DIG A DEEPER AND DEEPER HOLE REGARDING THE LONG TERM SURVIVAL OF CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC SALMON FISHERY. ONE THING IS FOR SURE THOUGH. WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE TO WORK TOGETHER TO DO WHATEVER WE CAN TO BRING SALMON BACK FROM THE BRINK. OUR NUMBER ONE GOAL OF TODAY'S HEARING IS TO HEAR FROM ALL OF YOU ABOUT THESE ISSUES AND TO RAISE AWARENESS OF THE- PRECARIOUS STATE OF OUR FISHERIES AND- EDUCATE THE LEGISLATURE RESIDENTS ABOUT THEIR STATUS. WE HAVE AN ALL STAR LINEUP OF PANELISTS HERE TODAY BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO TODAY'S AGENDA I'D LIKE TO BE A WELCOME ONCE AGAIN CENTERED AWAY SO DO THE HEARING. CENTER WAY SO FOR ANY OPENING COMMENTS THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE ESPECIALLY ON THIS VERY IMPORTANT TOPIC AND- I LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM THE PANEL- MANY YEARS AGO ABOUT NINE YEARS AGO WE ACTUALLY- I BROUGHT CHUCK BONHAM TO- SAN DIEGO AND HE VISITED THE TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY. WE GOT A CHANCE TO VISIT. THE FOUNDATION OF WHAT USED TO BE- THRIVING SALMON CANNERY. IN SAN DIEGO TIJUANA RIVER VALLEY BORDER WITH MEXICO. WE USED TO HAVE A THRIVING SALMON CANNERY WHERE NOW WE- SCARCELY HAVE A RIVER- WITHIN HIS MOSTLY SPEWING CONTAMINATED WATER. INTO THE PACIFIC OCEAN. MAN- YOU KNOW I. YOU KNOW IT'S SOMETHING MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD ON EACH ON THE TWIN RIVER VALLEY BUT ALSO. THIS CONCEPT THAT WE'RE LOSING- EIGHT IMPORTANT IMPAIRMENT EVERY SINGLE YEAR- WE'RE LOSING- VARMINT THAT ASSISTS SUPPORTED- VARIOUS SPECIES OF FISH INCLUDING SALMON. SOME THAT NO LONGER ROAM THE PLANET THAT NO LONGER EXISTS THAT WERE ENDEMIC TO SPECIFIC RIVERS. ALONG CALIFORNIA THAT IT NOW ARE ARE. DEEPLY DEEPLY IMPACTED BY. URBAN DEVELOPMENT. ONE OF ONE THING IS TO HAVE A RIBBON DEVELOPMENT NOW THE THING IS NOT TO MITIGATE. THE DEVELOPMENT. WHICH LEADS TO THE DEGRADATION OF A LOT OF IMPORTANT HABITAT. SHOW UP YOU KNOW I'M HOPING WE DO A BETTER JOB. OF MANAGING THIS IMPORTANT RESOURCE BECAUSE IT'S THE- IT'S THE- THE THREAD THAT WEAVES ARE ARE VERY DIVERSE. FABRIC OF THIS OF THIS PLANET. AND AS WE SEE- THE CONTAMINATION OR WATERS COMBINED WITH CLIMATE CHANGE WE HAVE SCARCELY ANY HOPE. THAT THE THESE IMPORTANT SPECIES WILL CONTINUE TO SURVIVE SO- BUT YOU KNOW I POD YOU TAKING ON THIS EFFORT AND SEEING WHAT WE CAN DO TO PRESERVE. WHATEVER WE HAVE LEFT- FOR THE SIMON TO CONTINUE TO RUN UP THE RIVER AND REPRODUCE AND- AND RESTORE WHAT WAS. A THRIVING REPRODUCTION OF THE SPECIES. LOTS OF WORK HAS BEEN DONE IN LAST TEN YEARS OF THE LOAN ON PART OF THIS LEGISLATURE AND OF THIS ADMINISTRATION OF THE PREVIOUS ONE AND I JUST APPLAUD EVERYONE THAT'S BEEN PART OF THIS EFFORT- BUT- WE YOU KNOW THIS THERE ARE CERTAIN. TRENDS THAT ARE TRENDING IN THE WRONG DIRECTION WE NEED TO DO MORE AND I WANT TO SUPPORT YOU KNOW SO WE WORK IN THIS AREA I ALSO APPRECIATE A LETTER THAT WAS CIRCULATED FROM THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION I GOT A CHANCE TO SPEND SOME TIME WITH THE CHAIRMAN OF PIZZA OVER IN THE LAST FEW DAYS. AND THE ISSUE OF PLASTICS IN THE ENVIRONMENT IS JUST ANOTHER AREAS THAT WE NEED TO- WORK A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVELY ON I ACTUALLY GOT TO VISIT SOME LOCATIONS OUT IN THE PACIFIC OCEAN. WHERE WE VISITED JUSTIN ON BELIEVABLE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC DEBRIS. AND DOLPHINS AND TURTLES WERE JUST YOU KNOW SWIMMING IN THE STUFF- COVERED BY IT AND I THINK CALIFORNIA SHOULD DO MORE WAS PART I PLAN TO- I'M CURRENTLY. DEVELOP SOME LEGISLATION THAT- CONTROL. PLASTICS I HAVE A BILL THAT I INTRODUCED LAST YEAR THEY WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING ON ANOTHER ONE. BUT I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE THAT WILL AT LEAST REQUIRE CALIFORNIA TAKE CARE OF AT LEAST WHAT IT PRODUCES THAT IT'S NOT. IMPORTED INTO OTHER ENVIRONMENTS AND WE HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO THAT AND THAT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT IS JUST A BIG PROBLEM. FOR ARC OUR PLANET FOUND AND- I PLAN TO WORK ON THAT AND HOPEFULLY- JOINT EFFORTS WITH THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION TO CONTROL PLASTICS IN THE OCEANS AND RIVERS. AND OUR LAKES SO THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND I- APPRECIATE YOU GIVING ME A FEW COMMENTS. NO I SENT AWAY SO WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND REALLY LOOK FORWARD TO YOUR ENGAGEMENT HERE TODAY IT MEANS SO MUCH THAT YOU'RE ITH US THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER SENATOR IT'S REALLY GOOD TO SEE YOU.

THESE ARE SOME OF THE EFFORTS PERTINENT TO THE INTEREST OF THIS COMMITTEE ALL OF THESE EFFORTS ARE UNDER WAY WITH A STRONG FOCUS. ON CLIMATE RESILIENCE- YEAH I KNOW THE RESTORATION I'M MORE PARTNERING VERY CLOSELY WITH TOM DEPARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE- TO CONTEND AND TO CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND PILOT RESEARCH. WITH CALIFORNIA SEA GRANT AND RESTORATION PROJECTS AIMED AT UNDERSTANDING THE DRIVERS OF RECENT HELP THE CLIENTS. IN CALIFORNIA AND EXPLORING POTENTIAL RESTORATION APPROACHES. I ADVISE YOU TO PLEASE REFER TO THAT DEPARTMENT THIS MY LIFE'S WRITTEN UPDATE FOR MORE DETAILED SUMMARY OF THESE PROJECTS. INCLUDING THE RESULTS OF OUR TENT REMOVAL EFFORTS USING URCHIN FISHERMEN OFF THE NORTH COAST. AND THEY COME MONTHS THE OPPOSITE WILL BE WORKING TO DEVELOP IT IN TERMS OF HELP ACTION PLAN ON AGAIN- DEVELOPED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DEPARTMENT. INTO A FINAL ACTION PLAN WITH PRIORITIES FOR COLLABORATIVE PARTNERSHIP BASED ACTION BASED ON RESULTS OF PILOT PROJECTS AS WELL AS SCIENTIFIC TRIBAL AND PUBLIC INPUT- FORMER INTERJECTED AREA HAS A LOT GOING ON HERE CALIFORNIA'S MARINE PROTECTED AREA. NETWORK IS APPROACHING ITS TEN YEAR ANNIVERSARY AND ALONG WITH ITS FIRST DECADE ALL MANAGEMENT REVIEW. ASIDE DMR IF YOU WELL WELL IT SAYS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE M. K. NETWORK IS MAKING PROGRESS TOWARDS THE GOALS OF THE MARINE LIFE PROTECTION ACT. WHICH IS PROTECTING THE STATE'S NATURAL MARINE BIODIVERSITY REBUILDING DEPLETED POPULATIONS AND IMPROVING OCEAN HEALTH- CALIFORNIA'S ESTABLISHED A STATEWIDE MPA MONITORING PROGRAMS YOU KNOW. PHASE ONE WAS THE BASELINE MONITORING IT AND WE'LL- FIND IT FACE TO WHICH IS LONG TERM MONITOR MONITORING WHICH IS UNDER WAY- AND THOSE RESULTS WILL BE USEFUL. FOR THE FOLLOWING- THE FINAL DETAIL MANAGEMENT REVIEW. ON LOOK FOR SOME RESULTS OF- VARIOUS DIFFERENT TECHNICAL REPORTS BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATORS ARE TO BE MADE PUBLIC- IN EARLY TWENTY TWENTY TWO- SO THAT'LL INFORM PROGRESS IN MEETING THE GOALS OF THE MLBPA. ANALYSIS OF THIS MARCH TRADE DATA BY THE PRINCIPAL INVESTIGATOR TEAMS AN EXPERT WORKING GROUP AT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR ECOLOGICAL ANALYSIS AND SYNTHESIS- NCSA UCSB. WILL BE GUIDED BY THE STATE'S MPA MANTRA ACTION PLAN AS WELL AS A REPORT. ALL THE SCIENTIFIC GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING CALIFORNIA'S MPA NETWORK WHICH IS AUTHORED BY A WORKING GROUP OF THE OPC SCIENTIFIC ADVISORY CHANT AND RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR. ANOTHER ESTATE. CALIFORNIA MPA NETWORK REPORT THERE'S A SCIENCE TRUST THAT APARTMENT APARTMENT FISHING GAME AND- BC ALL WORKED WITH JUST S. A. T. ON THESE EFFORTS. THERE'S A ROBUST COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT EFFORTS CURRENTLY UNDERWAY TO ENSURE THAT MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PERSPECTIVES ON NPA NATIONAL PRIORITIES DEFINITIONS OF MPAS SUCCESS. AND ROLE OF COMMUNITIES AND M. J. MANAGEMENT. AT JUST SAYING CALIFORNIA NATIVE TRIBES WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT VIA FORMAL CONSULTATION INFORMAL ENGAGEMENT AND EFFORTS SUCH AS THE TRIBAL MARINE STEWARDS NETWORK. WHICH IS SUPPORTING INDIGENOUS STEWARDSHIP AND CO MANAGEMENT OF MJ'S FIRST FOUR TRIBES CURRENTLY INVOLVED. IN THAT STEWART'S NETWORK PROGRAM. THREE LET THEM MAY BE USED TO DEVELOP RECOMMENDATIONS FOR BETTER MANAGEMENT OF ANY NBA NETWORK DMR AS ENTIRELY SEPARATE- THE STAKES THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVE THIS QUESTION COMES UP AN AWFUL LOT SO I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT YEAH IT'S ENTIRELY SEPARATE FROM THAT PROCESS. A MARINE PROTECTED AREA STATEWIDE LEADERSHIP TEAM HAS NEARLY COMPLETED THEIR AMBITIOUS AND COMPREHENSIVE FOR YOUR WORK PLAN. THE PLAN FOCUSES ON FINANCE EQUITY EDUCATION ENFORCEMENT AND MORE LOOK FOR IT BY THE END OF THE YEAR A LOT GOING ON IN THE NBA SPACE. IN THE AREA OF REDUCTION OF RISK OF WAYAND'S ETERNAL INTEGUMENT FISHING GEAR. ON THROUGH A COMPETITIVE CALL DEVELOPED WITH. THE OPC F. PACIFIC STATES MARINE FISHERIES COMMISSION. OBJECTS WERE SELECTED TO ADVANCE OUR KNOWLEDGE AND EFFECTIVENESS AT REDUCING WELL IT'S YOUR TOTAL ENTITLEMENTS AND IMPACTS ON THE FISHING INDUSTRY- I WAS ABOUT ONE POINT SIX MILLION OR SO DOLLARS THAT WERE SPENT. ON THESE ONGOING EFFORTS THE FAIRLAWN INSTITUTE TO ENHANCE AND INTEGRATE WELL DISTRIBUTION DATA TO REDUCE ENTANGLEMENT REST. CASCADIA RESEARCH COLLECTIVE TO PROVIDE REAL TIME WELL OBSERVATIONS AND VALIDATE MODELS TO ASSESS AND TAKE ON THAT RISK. AND THEN ALSO ON MONITORING OF LEATHERBACK TURTLE DISTRIBUTION OF MIGRATIONS REDUCING TANG ON THE REST WE HOPE THAT THEY'LL BE AT THE END OF THIS- A PRODUCT. THAT WILL BE VERY USER FRIENDLY- FOR THAT APARTMENT- TO TWO YEARS TO REALLY DETERMINE REST. ON THE OBVIOUSLY THE VERY HIGH PROFILE ISSUE- I'VE DONE JANICE CRAB ON MANAGEMENT. SO PRODUCTS ARE WELL WE PROJECT WORKING CLOSE. WITH THE OTHER TO LEVERAGE RESOURCES BUT THEY'RE ALSO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT'S DUNGENESS CRAB WORKING GROUP. PROVIDE REAL TIME DATA TO CONTRIBUTE TO ENTITLEMENT RISK ASSESSMENTS. THROUGH THE RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PROGRAM THE RAMP. ALSO WE'VE GOT SOME HOARDING APARTMENT ON JEFF GILL NET BUYBACK PROGRAM WHICH IS NOW FULLY FUNDED WITH BOTH STATE AND PHILANTHROPIC RESOURCES. AN AREA OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION MICROPLASTICS WITH A RAPIDLY CHANGING CLIMATE THE PACE AND SCOPE OF OCEAN ACIDIFICATION AND HYPOXIA IS LIKELY TO INCREASE IN THE YEARS AHEAD. YOUR PC WILL ALLOCATE OVER THREE MILLION DOLLARS ON OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HYPOXIA MONITORING AND RESEARCH FOR THE COST OF CALIFORNIA ON- WITHIN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS WE'VE ALREADY ALLOCATED ABOUT HALF OF THOSE RESEARCH RESOURCES. AND PLASTICS AND MICROPLASTICS POLLUTION THAT CENTER WASTE OF PRODUCT WE ACKNOWLEDGE THIS IS A GLOBAL CRISIS AND CALIFORNIA'S WATERS ARE NO DIFFERENT THIS YEAR THE OPC DEVELOPEDA TOP TEN LIST OF RECOMMENDATIONS. FOCUSING ON LARGER PLASTICS DOES GREATER THAN FIVE MILLIMETERS IN SIZE ALSO AS REQUIRED BY SENATE BILL TWELVE SIXTY THREE- AUTHORED BY SENATOR ORRIN G. NOW IT'LL BE C. WILL COMPLETE THE NATION'S FIRST EVER MICROPLASTICS STRATEGIES. FOR COASTAL WATERS THE FIRST DRAFT SHOULD BE RELEASED BY THE END OF THE YEAR THE REPORT WILL INCLUDE PROBLEM CHARACTERIZATION SAMPLING AND ANALYTICAL METHODS SOURCE CHARACTERIZATION SOURCE REDUCTION AND TREATMENT RECOMMENDATIONS. AND RESEARCH PRIORITIES. AFTER GAUGE BUT STRATEGY AND LISTENING SESSION OKAY SHE YOU CAN CONSULT AND COLLABORATE WITH CALIFORNIA NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TRIBAL GAUGE AND STRATEGY. I HAD A FRAMEWORK FOR ENHANCED PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN THE LBC AND TRIBES ON OCEAN AND COASTAL MATTERS. OR HOLDING LISTENING SESSIONS THIS MONTH TO HEAR AND DISCUSS TRIBES PERSPECTIVES ON TWO KEY ISSUES. BEST PRACTICES FOR CONDUCTING OUT RECENT ENGAGING WITH TRIBES AND RESPECTFUL AND EFFECTIVE MANNER. AND TRYING TO FIND OUT TRIBES PRIORITIES FOR CLOSE ON OCEAN MANAGEMENT AND CONSERVATION. OUTCOMES OF THESE LISTENING SESSIONS ONE FORM THE DEVELOPMENT OF A DRAFT TRIBAL ENGAGEMENT STRATEGY WHICH SHOULD BE COMPLETED SOMETIME IN THE MIDDLE OF NEXT YEAR. THEY'LL BE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONSULTATION ONCE THE DRAFT STRATEGIES DEVELOPED. AN AREA OF AQUACULTURE. ON THE AQUACULTURE PRINCIPLES IN ACTION PLAN DEVELOPMENT OF THE STATEWIDE OUT OF TRACTION PLANS UNDERWAY AND PROCEEDING ON SCHEDULE WITH PLANNED COMPLETION BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND C. AS IN CALIFORNIA SEA GRANT AND CLOSE PARTNERSHIP WITH ADOBE STOCK- FINALIZE MEMBERSHIP ON BOTH THE COMMUNITY AND SCIENTIFIC WAS SAME GROUPS AS WELL AND HELD INITIAL MEETINGS ABOUT. THIS IS PART OF THE PROCESS DEVELOP A WORKING DRAFT OF THE ACTION PLAN WITH COMPLETION OF THE FIRST BALL DROP EXPECTED IN THE NEXT FEW MONTHS. AND IT TO MOVING FORWARD ON THE ACTION PLAN OPC PUBLICLY RELEASED THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES FOR SUSTAINABLE MARINE AQUACULTURE CALIFORNIA. AT THE JAN OBC MEETING. THESE PRINCIPLES WORK COOPERATIVELY DEVELOPED BY THE AQUACULTURE LEADERSHIP TEAM LED BY SECRETARY WHITE PROFILE AND COMPOSED OF A PROGRAM PROGRAMMATIC STAFF. SKEWS ME OF ALL STATE AGENCIES INVOLVED IN THE REGULATION PERMITTING AND DEVELOPMENT OF AQUACULTURE IN CALIFORNIA THIS INCLUDES CALIFORNIA APARTMENT A FISH AND WILDLIFE CALIFORNIA FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. BECAUSE THE COMMISSION AND STATE LANDS COMMISSION OPC CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE AND THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS WELL AS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. THESE PRINCIPLES INCLUDE USING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE ENSURING SUSTAINABILITY BUILDING GOVERNANCE MANAGEMENT PARTNERSHIPS AFFECTED PLANNING FISH AND EFFECTIVE OVERSIGHT AND PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND FOOD SAFETY. THE AQUACULTURE LEADERSHIP TEAM CONTINUES TO MEET TO COORDINATE A COUPLE PIECE OF STRATEGY FOR IMPLEMENTATION OF THE GUIDING PRINCIPLES ACROSS ALL MEMBER AGENCIES AND WE'RE NOW INTEGRATING THE ANC'S GROUP. INTO THAT PROCESS. AND THE THIRTY BY THIRTY FRONTS WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY WITH DR JENNIFER NORRIS- THAT'S RESOURCE AGENCIES DEPUTY SECRETARY FOR BIODIVERSITY AND HABITAT. ON THE COASTAL AND OCEAN COMPONENTS OF THE THIRTY BY THIRTY INITIATIVES THE RECOMMENDATIONS- FROM THE CONSERVATION OF COASTAL WATERS ADVISORY PANEL AND AN INTEGRATED INTO THE DRAFT. PATHWAYS TO THE THIRTY BY THIRTY DOCUMENT WHICH WILL DETAIL OPPORTUNITIES AND STRATEGIES TO ACHIEVE THIRTY BY THIRTY IN CALIFORNIA. ON THE OCEAN SIDE WHICH IS WHERE WERE INVOLVED THE PATHWAY TO CONSERVING 30% OF CALIFORNIA'S COASTAL WATERS WILL FORCE INCLUDE THE 16% OF STATE WATERS CURRENTLY PROTECTED WITHIN MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. I R. TIES FOCUSED ON WORKING WITH FEDERAL RESOURCE MANAGER STRENGTHENED BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION MEASURES. IN CALIFORNIA'S NATIONAL MARIN SANCTUARIES. AS A REMINDER PRESIDENT BIDEN HAS SIMILAR THIRTY BY THIRTY GOALS AS PART OF THE AMERICA THE BEAUTIFUL PROGRAM. THE COLLABORATION COORDINATION WITH NATO AND THE SANCTUARY'S MAKES SENSE FOR THE STATE. AND THE NATION. EXAMPLES OF POTENTIAL MEASURES TO CONSIDER AN ASPIRIN CENTURIES COULD INCLUDE. MANDATORY VESSEL SPEED REDUCTIONS PHASING OUT THE USE OF PARTICULARLY HARMFUL FISHING GEAR. OR MAKING EXISTING GEAR RESTRICTIONS PERMANENT STRENGTHENING WATER QUALITY PROTECTIONS RESTORING DEGRADED HABITATS. AND BANNING SINGLE USE PLASTICS WITHIN CENTURY WATERSHEDS ARE JUST EXAMPLES- JUST. TO LET YOU KNOW ABOUT SIX MON. SIXTY SECONDS OKAY ALL RIGHTS ALL ALL OF THE PATHWAY DOCUMENTS PROM FOR THIRTY BY THIRTY- SHOULD BE RELEASED EITHER BY THE END OF THIS YEAR OR- BIG BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR SO LOOK FOR THAT. AND THEN THE LAST THING ON OFFSHORE WIND FARM WHICH IS ANOTHER AREA THAT WERE HEAVILY INVOLVED IN WITH A LARGE. GROUP OF AGENCIES AND NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY- IS THAT- JUST TO LET YOU KNOW THAT THE BUREAU OF OCEAN ENERGY MANAGEMENT RELEASED TWO ANNOUNCEMENTS FOR CALL AREA SOPHOMORE OBEY. AND HUMBLE AND PUBLIC COMMENTS FOR THESE ANNOUNCEMENTS WILL INFORM THE PROCESS AND EVALUATION. OF FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENT MOVING FORWARD ON THE PROTEIN CALIFORNIA IS REALLY TRYING TO MINIMIZE. THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS TO FISHERIES MARINE LIFE AND CULTURE RESOURCES. SO WE'RE TALKING ABOUT FLOATING OFFSHORE WIND TWENTY MILES PLUS OFFSHORE IN ALMOST ALL CASES. THE KEY THING IS NEXT YEAR IS THAT THE CALIFORNIA COASTAL COMMISSION WEB CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION HEARINGS. ON TOAST TO CALL AREAS- AND THOSE WILL PROBABLY BE IN APRIL FOR THE NORTH COAST. AND JUNE I'M FOR THE CENTRAL COAST AND WE'RE SUPPORTING THAT CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION PROCESS PROCESS WORKING WITH OTHERS INCLUDING THE DEPARTMENT. ON FILLING ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT DATA GAPS INFORMATION GAPS WORKING WITH THE FISHING COMMUNITY. BOND AS WELL AS ALL THE VARIOUS DIFFERENT SCIENTIFIC DATA BASES THERE AND BRINGING ALL THAT INFORMATION TO BEAR FOR THE CONSISTENCY DETERMINATION ON- A REPORT THAT REPORTS WILL BE COMING OUT OF THE COASTAL COMMISSION. SO AS YOU CAN TELL A LOT GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK. DR GOLD THANK YOU SO MUCH ADDUCTOR GOLD IS COMING TO US LIVE FROM THE PANDEMIC CONFERENCE ROOM. OF HIS FORWARDS WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE- YOU WORK SIR AT I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO GO YOU HAVE ANOTHER MEETING I'M TO TURN TO. WE SO THAT WOULD SEE IF THERE'S A QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. NO QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS HERE A DOCTOR CALLED IT A FEW ITEMS- QUICKLY. ON THE ISSUE OF THE BULL KELP COLLAPSE. WE SAW THAT GOSH I THINK IT WAS IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN FIFTEEN. IN THE END WE SAW IT IN YOU MENTION THIS IN YOUR REPORT- SIGNIFICANT INCREASE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PURPLE URCHIN IN DEEP CONCERN FOR FISHERMEN- WERE SEEN THAT BULL COME COME BACK ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH COAST. TALK WITH US ABOUT THAT. BASICALLY IT'S THE COOLER WATER TEMPERATURES. I THINK THAT WE'RE SEEING AND THAT WARM WATER BLOB THAT WE HAD. FOR QUITE SOME TIME REALLY KILLED OFF THE KELP. ANY PREDICTIONS OF WHAT YOU SEE WHAT YOU SEE HERE FOR- THAT BULL KELP WHICH IS ICONIC FOR CALIFORNIA HERE IN THE YEARS TO COME- CENTER EIGHT I THINK IT'S STILL A WORK IN PROGRESS I THINK. WE'RE WE'RE ALL EXCITED BY ANY SIGN OF PROGRESS SINCE THERE'S BEEN SO LITTLE. ON IT REALLY WITHIN THE LAST YOU KNOW SIX YEARS PLUS. ARMED WITH THE MARINE HEAT WAVES AND THAT THAT- CHEN BEHRENS SAID REALLY WREAKED HAVOC ON THE BULL KELP. ON ESPECIALLY OFF A MENDOCINO AND SONOMA COAST. AND SO ON IN THAT REGARD. YOU KNOW WE KNOW HOW. MUCH PEOPLE CARE ABOUT THIS. NOT JUST FROM A FINANCIAL STANDPOINT BUT JUST FROM A CULTURAL STANDPOINT IT JUST IT'S SUCH A HUGE PARTY IDENTITY. ON IN IN YOUR DISTRICT JUST AS YOU KNOW BETTER THAN ANYBODY. ELSE SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH. THE LOCAL COMMUNITY WHETHER IT'S- PURCHASE FISHING COMMUNITY. AS WELL AS THE- NGOS ON TO IT TO REALLY TRY TO SEE WHETHER. YOU KNOW RESTORATION IS GOING TO HELP ACCELERATE THAT RECOVERY. ON AND SO ON THE OTHER ASPECT IS WE HAVE SIX DIFFERENT STUDIES SOME THE TOP HELP. RESEARCHERS ON- IT LITERALLY IN THE COUNTRY. THAT ARE WORKING AT WHAT ARE THE BEST WAYS TO GO ABOUT RESTORATION MOVING FORWARD. SO YES THE FACT THAT WE'VE HAD COOLER WATERS ON HAS HELPED A BIT. BUT I THINK IT'S STILL TOO EARLY TO TELL. ON WHETHER OR NOT THIS IS GOING TO BE A BIG SUCCESS. OR WHETHER IT WERE GETTING SOME PROMISING PRELIMINARY SIGNS AT THIS POINT AND SO- THAT APARTMENT AND OBESITY I MEAN WE REALLY ARE WORKING ON THIS ALMOST DAILY TOGETHER. ON IT GENERALLY TRACKING THAT AND TRYING TO MOVE FORWARD. SO THAT'S THAT'S PRETTY MUCH WHERE WE'RE AT. GREAT UPDATE ON- ISSUES OF COMPANY GONNA GO TO. ALL THE OF. WIND AND- MOST FOCUS ON THAT- HUNDRED MEGAWATT PROJECT AREA OFF OF THE HUMBLE COAST. AND WEAR A BOW ON THE FEDS HAVE BEEN FOCUSED IN REGARDS TO THE PROJECT AREA I THINK ONE OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AND I KNOW IT'S OUTSIDE THE TERRITORY BUT RELATED. GETTING THESE- THESE PROJECTS STOOD UP AND BUILD IT'S CRITICAL BUT THE TRANSMISSION LINES IS WHAT WORLD WE GONNA NEED TO LOOK AT AS AN UPGRADE. AND I THINK THAT'S GOING TO NEED TO GO HAND IN HAND. DR I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT AT ALL. ALL AT ALL I WOULD SAY AND IT'S NOT GOING TO BE A DIRECT ANSWER BUT YOU KNOW I. I HAVE NOT WORKED IN THE STATE FOR A LONG TIME I'VE BEEN HERE FOR ABOUT TWO AND A HALF YEAR SINCE I WAS APPOINTED. BUT I CAN TELL YOU OF ALL THE ISSUES THAT YOU JUST HEARD ABOUT THAT WE WORK ON OBESITY. THE ONE THAT I'VE SEEN BE GREATEST COLLABORATION ON IT AND I REALLY GIVES THE ENERGY COMMISSION KAREN DOUGLAS A GREAT JOB CREDIT FOR THIS. HAS BEEN OFFSHORE WIND ISSUE. AND SO WHETHER IT'S THE COASTAL COMMISSION OR THE DEPARTMENT OR THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION. WE'VE ALL BEEN WORKING I AM NOT EXAGGERATING MANY LEAST TWICE A WEEK. TALKING ABOUT ALL OF THESE VARIOUS DIFFERENT ISSUES INCLUDING TRANSMISSION. AND SUB TRANSMISSION OBVIOUSLY IS MUCH MORE IN THE PURVIEW. OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND ON IT IS REALLY WHAT THEIR FOCUS IS ON AT THIS POINT. OUR FOCUS AS I SAID BEFORE IS REALLY TRYING TO FILL THOSE DATA GAPS- WHICH ARE SO EXTENSIVE. I'M TO MAKE SURE THAT WHEN WE DO MOVE FORWARD. WITH OFFSHORE WIND WE DO IT AND BY FAR THE MOST ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE AND SUSTAINABLE WAY POSSIBLE. YEAH AND I DON'T THINK SO I THINK LONG TERM THAT'S GOING TO BE HAD IN BY THE WAY YOUR- DOCTOR WILL DEFINITELY RIGHT COMMISSIONER DOUGLAS HAS BEEN ABSOLUTELY TENACIOUS IN PURSUIT TO BE ABLE TO GET. OFF SHORE WIND STOOD UP IN THE STATE AND GRATEFUL FOR HER LEADERSHIP ON THAT. I THINK WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT. THE INVESTMENT IN TRANSMISSION LINE TO BE ABLE TO GET THAT ENERGY INTO THE REST OF THE CALIFORNIA GREAT. I THINK THAT'S GOING TO BE A CRITICAL PIECE OF THAT. AND THE OTHER ITEM AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE TALKED WITH- THE OFFSHORE WIND COMPANIES ABOUT IN FACT WE HOSTED. A COMMITTEE HEARING GOSH FOUR YEARS AGO ON THIS UP IN THE CITY OF EUREKA AND HUMBOLDT COUNTY. IS RATHER THAN GOING PORT BY PORT. LOOKING AT SOME TYPE OF SETTLEMENT WITH. EACH OF THE PORT ASSOCIATIONS THE FLEET SALMON FLEET- THE CRAB FLEET WE NEED TO LOOK AT A STATE WIDE SETTLEMENT. IF THERE'S GOING TO BE ANY LOSS OF FISHING GROUNDS AS WE'VE SEEN LOTS OF FISHING GROUNDS ALL FORWARD BY THE WAY SPECIALLY. FOR THE MARINE PROTECTED AREAS BUT WHAT. ARE THE LAW. ARE AT STAKE AS WELL SO I THINK THAT'S A- THAT WE'RE GOING NEED TO CAN. TO PURSUE IS WE GO FORWARD. ON THE ISSUE OF OFFSHORE WIND CENTER WAY SO DID YOU WANT TO. JUMP IN ON THIS IN A WAY SO. MY QUESTION IS GONNA BE FOR THE NEXT PRESENTER OKAY ABSOLUTELY. THE LAST REQUIRED. SUMMER CHOIR JUST JUST INTERJECT JUST QUICKLY. I I'M SORRY IF I GLOSSED OVER THAT I. EAT WHAT I WHAT I MEANT TO SAY. I'M WORTH THE EFFORT OF KEREN DOUGLAS AND JIM IT AT THE END OF YOUR COMMISSION IS. THAT THE STUDY IS THAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT WHETHER IT SUPPORTS STUDIES WHETHER THE TRANSMISSION STUDIES ON THE LIGHT. THOSE ARE BEING TALKED ABOUT AND THEY'RE EITHER UNDER WAY OR THEY'RE GOING TO BE UNDER WAY VERY VERY SHORTLY SO I DID WANT TO GIVE YOU SOME ASSURANCE IN THAT REGARD. ON A VERY VERY WELL WHERE WE HELP SECURE THE MONEY TO BE ABLE TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS IS. WELL AND- THERE NEEDS TO BE A- OR- CALL. NOT A PORT BY PORT POLICY. AND THAT'S ONE OF THE BIGGEST CONCERNS I KNOW THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS. ESPECIALLY FOR CALIFORNIA SUITE. THE LAST PIECE ON THE THROAT YEAH MR SECTARIAN THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I KNOW YOU NEED TO. GET TO YOUR NEXT MEETING- IT CAN YOU TALK ABOUT THAT AQUACULTURE ACTION PLAN. IN JUST THE INTERACTION YOU'VE HAD WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE. IN THEIR PROGRAM IN REGARDS TO PERMITTING. IF YOU WANT TO JUST TOUCH ON THAT HERE TWO MINUTES. ON THE INTERFACE BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES AND HOW THAT'S WORKING WITH AQUACULTURE. JUST EVERYTHING WE'RE DOING OUT ON THE PLANNING EFFORT IS BEING DONE- WORKING WITH- WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND SO ON. YEAH SO LOTS OF MEETINGS- WE JUST HAD ONE A WEEK AGO WITH- REPRESENTED FROM COASTAL COMMISSION CASSIE PLAYFUL AS WELL AS A CRACK SHERMAN FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON MEETING WITH AND SHE'S REALLY TALK ABOUT. DEVELOPING THE ACTION PLAN AND REALLY FOCUSING ON THAT ON THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA BOND AND WHAT'S REALLY CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ON AND REALLY. THAT'S THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO INTEGRATE USED TO PROCESS EASE OF USING THE PRINCIPLES RIGHT NOW ON BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY THERE'S APPLICATIONS THAT ARE IN THE QUEUE RIGHT NOW AND WE WANT TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE'RE DEALING WITH IT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THAT. I'M VERY PIECEMEAL BASIS- WITH DON KNOTTS MUCH CONSISTENCY AS WE NEED TO FRANKLY THERE SIR A LACK OF RESOURCES I'M FROM THE STANDPOINT OF STAFFING ON TO REALLY- PROCESS APPLICATIONS. AND DO THAT IN A SOUND MANNER ON BUT THAT'S ONE OF THINGS THAT'S GOING TO BE ADDRESSED IN THE ACTION PLAN- HOPEFULLY THERE'S SOMETHING THAT CAN BE DONE IN THE INTERIM AS WELL. SO THE COMMUNICATION REALLY COULD NOT BE EVEN TIGHTER THAN WHAT IT IS RIGHT NOW YEAH AND PROCEED TO WORK THAT THE COAST MACHINE PUT IN REGARDS TO THE PERMITTING- ON THAT ISSUE AT CENTER WE SAW POLICE ON THIS YOU KNOW I DID WANT TO GET THE RESOURCES AGENCY PERSPECTIVE ON THE SALMON ISSUE ON THE SACRAMENTO RIVER. AND. SO IN. WORDS IN PREVIOUS REPORTS WE HER A LOT ABOUT- THE FISH THAT WERE INTRODUCED INTO LIKE THE STRIPER THAT WAS INTRODUCED INTO THE AMERICAN IVER ON THE- SACRAMENTO RIVER THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED TO SHARPLY TO PREFER NATION THAT HAS. REDUCED THE AMOUNT OF- SALMON HATCHERIES AND THE RUNS AND SO AT SOME POINT THERE WAS DISCUSSION ABOUT DOING SOMETHING ABOUT THAT AND HEALTHY MIX THIS- THE STRIPER ANOTHER APPROACH A FISH SAID- BETTER AFFECT THOSE POPULATIONS OF INFECTING SALMON AND THE SMELL. AND AT SOME POINT THE SMOKE WAS CONNECTED- THE- WATER TRANSFERS WERE CONNECTED TO THE REDUCTIONS A SMALL POPULATION BUT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT SCHREIBER WAS A PREDATORY FISH OF THE SMELT SO. HAS ANYTHING% BEEN DONE IN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS TO ADDRESS- THE- THE FISH THAT HAVE BEEN INTRODUCED INTO THE RIVERS AND THE DAMAGE THAT THEY CAUSE INTO THE NATIVE POPULATIONS. I SENT HER AWAY SO I THINK IT'S A GREAT SEGUE TO THE NEXT SPEAKER WHOSE- QUALIFIED TO ANSWER THAT I'M ABSOLUTELY NOT AND THAT WOULD BE- DIRECTOR BONHAM. OKAY ALL RIGHT THANK YOU SO MUCH GUYS SO CERTAINLY SO YOU ALL GOOD IF WE HOLD THAT DOES IT RUN PERFECT. MR UNDERSECRETARY THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS UNDERSECRETARY IS ABOUT FIFTEEN MINUTES LATE SO WE APPRECIATE IT SIR GOOD TO TALK TO YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TENDING TO. THANK YOU SO MUCH MY PLEASURE THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN THAT WAS UNDERSECRETARY FOR OCEAN CALLS A POLICY WITH THE CALIFORNIA TO RESOURCE AGENCY THAT WAS MARTIN GOLD ARE NOT GOING TO BE TRANSITIONING TO. CHUCK BONHAM TRUCK BONHAMS THE LONGEST SERVING DIRECTOR. OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL LIVE IN STATE HISTORY WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT THE DIRECTOR IS WITH US. THE DIRECTOR IS GOING TO BE HITTING ON SEVERAL NOTES TODAY HE'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE WINTER RUN IN THE SACRAMENTO. AND THIS. TERRIBLE COLLAPSE THAT WE'VE SEEN WITH THIS YEAR'S WINNER RUN WITH ABOUT A 2% SURVIVAL WHAT THAT'S GONNA MEAN NOT NECESSARILY THIS YEAR BUT FOR THE YEARS TO COME. HE'S GONNA BE FOCUSING ON THE DUNGENESS CRAB. FISHERY WHICH IS A TOP TIER FISHERY HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. HE'S GONNA BE TOUCHING ON CENTRAL VALLEY WATER POLICY OF COURSE CLAIM IF DAM REMOVAL. HE'S GONNA BE TALKING TO US ABOUT THE AGENCY'S HATCHERY PROGRAMS AND- HOW THE DEPARTMENT TOOK PROACTIVE ACTION. ON THE DROUGHT. TRY TO BE ABLE TO SAVE ENDANGERED. SALMON SPECIES SO. ON TOP OF THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH AN OIL SPILL TO CHUCK BONHAM HAS BEEN A LITTLE BUSY HE IS FULLY CAPITATED THIS MORNING. MR BONHAM WE WELCOME YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TAKING THE TIME YOU HAVE TEN MINUTES SIR I'LL GIVE YOU SIXTY SECOND PROMPT A DOCTOR BOTTOM THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU CHAIR. AND SENT AWAY SO I JUST. WOULD SAY PERSONALLY TO BOTH OF YOU I HAVE REALLY BENEFITED FROM AND CHERISH THE RELATIONSHIP OUR PARTNERSHIP OVER THE DECADE I'VE BEEN DIRECTOR. TWO THINGS THAT CAME UP IN QUESTIONS WITH THE PRIOR SPEAKER FIRST JUST AS A POINT OF REFERENCE SENATOR MCGUIRE- FIRE DEPARTMENT ALSO HAS BEEN LIVING THROUGH COVETED AND HOW IT AFFECTS OUR WORK FORCES WORK PRODUCT SO UNDER THE FEDERAL CURES ACT THE FIRST ROUND. WE WERE ACTUALLY THE FIRST WEST COAST STATE TO GET FUNDS OUT BACK TO AFFECTED COMMERCIAL FISHING. INDUSTRY MEMBERS WE WERE ABLE TO GET OUT EIGHTEEN POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS. BEFORE ANY OTHER WEST COAST STATE WAS ABLE TO GET THEIR FUNDS OUT THE DOOR. THAT ADDRESSED ABOUT TWO THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED CLAIMS. ABOUT AN AVERAGE OF TEN THOUSAND DOLLARS OUT- CLAIM. AND THE LAST CLAIM WAS PAID OUT LAST NOVEMBER WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF DEALING WITH THE SECOND ROUND OF CARERS ARE DISASTER RELIEF SO THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS OPEN NOW. IT HAS ABOUT FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS IN IT NOTE TO MIKE CONROY AND EVERYONE ELSE IN THE SUITE THAT APPLICATION. WINDOW CLOSES NOVEMBER SEVENTEENTH AND THERE WILL BE NO LATE APPLICATIONS ACCEPTED. TURNING TO SENATOR WAY SAYS QUESTION ABOUT ON STRIPERS TRIED PASSING A DELTA YES THERE HAS BEEN ACTION IN THE LAST TEN YEARS BUT IT'S IMPORTANT THAT THE ACTION AND ON. WE HAVE ALL KINDS OF FISH AND OUR ESTUARIES IN OUR RIVERS AND CALIFORNIA THE SENATORS REFERRING TO THE- SACRAMENTO SAN JUAN SAN JOAQUIN DELTA- STRIPED BASS THERE THEY'VE BEEN THERE FOR. QUITE SOME TIME LONGER THAN YOU AND I'VE BEEN ALIVE. IN ONE COULD DECIDE TO DEPLOY ALL THREE THOUSAND PEOPLE IN OUR DEPARTMENT. GO INTO THE ESTUARY AND TRY TO READ A KID ALL THE STRIPED BASS. UNLESS YOU GET LITERALLY EVERYONE. THE POPULATION WILL JUST REBOUND BACK UP TO CARRYING CAPACITY ACROSS THE STADIUM THE SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE DOESN'T REALLY SUCK OR- UNEQUIVOCAL POSITION THAT IT'S THE PRESENCE OF STRIPED BASS THAT'S CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE OF WINTER RUN SALMON. THAT SAID WHAT WE HAVE. BEEN DOING FOR QUITE SOME TIME. IS DRAWING SIR AROUND CERTAIN PLACES IN THE ESTUARY AND THE CONFLUENCE OF RIVERS TO THE ESTUARY CALLING THEM HOT SPOTS ENGAGING IN TARGETED SCIENTIFIC WORK TO A RADICALLY WITHIN THE HOT SPOT. AND THEN ASSESSED SCIENTIFICALLY WHETHER THAT'S PRODUCING A POPULATION BENEFIT FOR WINTER RUN AND OTHER IMPERILED SALMON. TURNING TO THE MANY THINGS I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COVER TODAY LET'S START WITH- THE RECENT SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA OIL SPILL. NO OIL SPILL IS GOOD. THE BEST WILL SPELL IS ZERO SPILLS A HEART THEY HURT US ECONOMICALLY THEY HEARD US AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL THE HARDEST ENVIRONMENTALLY. A HARDEST AT THE PERSONAL LEVEL SO ABOUT A MONTH AGO YOU MAY YOU MAY HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING AND NOW KNOW THAT ABOUT FOUR AND A HALF MILES OFFSHORE FROM BASICALLY HUNTINGTON BEACH A PIPELINE CARRYING PRODUCTS FROM FEDERALLY MANAGED PLATFORMS IN FEDERAL WATERS. I HAD A LEAK THE LIKELY LEAK SOURCE IS ABOUT THIRTEEN INCH HORIZONTAL CRACKS. THIS PIPELINE RUNS ABOUT SEVENTEEN AND A HALF MILES FROM THE SHORE IN LONG BEACH. FOUR THOUSAND FEET AT PIPELINE WAS MOVED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIVE FEET OFF OF CENTER. AND THERE'S THE POTENTIAL IT'S DUE TO AN ANCHOR AND ANCHORAGE RIGHT. AT THIRTEEN INCH CRACKS PRODUCED THE SPELL A MONTH AGO. WELL WE SWUNG INTO ACTION YOU MAY NOT KNOW THE WITHIN OUR DEPARTMENT IS OUR OFFICE OF SPILL PREVENTION RESPONSE WAS CREATED I THINK IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE BY THE LEGISLATURE IT IS THE STATE'S ACTION AGENCY TO DEAL WITH WALLS. AT THAT MOMENT A MONTH AGO WE ASSUME THE WORST CASE SPILL OF ABOUT THREE THOUSAND BARRELS OR ONE HUNDRED AND THIRTY ONE THOUSAND GALLONS WE DID A VARIETY OF THINGS OVER THE LAST MONTH WE SURGED A WORK FORCE THAT REACHED NATIONWIDE. AND BY THE END OF THE FIRST WEEK OF THIS BILL WE HAD ALMOST FIFTEEN HUNDRED PEOPLE DEPLOYED IN THE THEATER OF RESPONSE. WE BROUGHT BOTH THE COUNTIES OF ORANGE COUNTY AND SAN DIEGO INTO WHAT'S CALLED THE UNIFIED COMMAND. THROUGH THEIR SEARCH OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES AND THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH OFFICERS WE IMMEDIATELY LIAISON TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION COMMUNITY INCLUDING FOR THE FIRST TIME. ASKING A NONPROFIT PARTNER SURFRIDER TO SERVE AS AN OFFICIAL LIAISON. WE DID THE SAME WITH OUR PARTNERS AND TRIBAL NATIONS. WE PUT BOOTS ON THE BEACHES ALSO ON THE WATER AND DEALT WITH IT SO WE'LL STILL. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T THANK EVERY SINGLE ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM MAYORS HUNTINGTON BEACH COMES TO MIND FOR SURE THROUGH ALL OF YOUR ASSEMBLY AND SENATE COLLEAGUES. TO THE CALIFORNIA CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION IT WAS LITERALLY AN ALL OF GOVERNMENT ALL HANDS ON DECK STATE PARKS STATE LANDS COMMISSION. EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THIS BILL A MONTH LATER. I'M THANKFUL THAT. MOST LIKELY STILL NUMBER IS MUCH LOWER FIVE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT BARRELS APPROXIMATELY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND GALLONS AND OUR IMPACT TO WILDLIFE BIRDS MARINE MAMMALS MORTALITY AND THE OILS QUANTIFICATION NUMBER OF WILDLIFE IMPACT IS BELOW ABOUT TWO HUNDRED WHICH DOESN'T DIMINISH THE IMPACT IS FAR LESS THAN WE THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A MONTH. LET ME TURN TO WHY THIS IS REALLY RELATED TO FISHERIES AND SEE IF I CAN QUICKLY SHARE SLIDE I CAN'T ALL. GIVE UP ON THAT EFFORT. DO YOU SEE THIS LIGHT ON YOUR SCREEN THIS SITE IS NOW UP MISTER DIRECTOR BRAD SO THIS REPRESENTS IN THE HATCHED AREA A FISHERIES CLOSURE. WHAT PURSUANT TO THE OIL SPILL WHAT HAPPENS UNDER LAW IS WHEN WE HAVE AN OIL SPILL. UNDER CODE I'M REQUIRED TO CLOSE AREAS AFFECTED TO TAKE IN CONSUMPTION OF FISH AND SELL JUMPERS WITHIN TWENTY FOUR HOURS A NOTIFICATION OF AN OIL SPILL. THIS REQUIRES ME TO INTENSELY COORDINATE AT BALLY PA WITH WHAT'S CALLED THE OFFICE OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH HAZARD ASSESSMENT. THERE ARE SEVERAL OTHER PROVISIONS WITHIN THE CODE THAT IT TRIGGERED ONCE WE'RE IN A SPILL RESPONSE SITUATION WHAT YOU SEE ON THE SCREEN. IS A CURRENT FISHERIES CLOSURE WHICH BEGAN OCTOBER THIRD AND WAS EXPANDED TWICE BASED ON THE BALL THE OIL OBSERVATIONS AND TRAJECTORIES WORKING IN CLOSE COORDINATION WITH THE WE ARE AND THE- FEDERAL EFFORT USING SATELLITE IMAGERY I KNOW WHAT'S- ACTIVATE THIS BILL TRAJECTORY. THIS IS OUR CURRENT CLOSURE IT'S APPROXIMATELY SIX HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE. WHERE MILES THE THING IS I IS DIRECTOR DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY UNDER LAW TO OPEN THIS BACK UP TO. ELIMINATE THE CLOSURE UNTIL WE COMPLETE A SERIES OF REQUIREMENTS WORKING WITH THE WE ARE. THIS IS ALL AROUND THE STREETS OF SEAFOOD SAMPLING. AND HERE'S WHY T'S MOST I THINK CULTURALLY AND ECONOMICALLY IMPACTFUL RIGHT NOW. WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT CRABS IN A MINUTE BUT THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ANALOG TO HELP PEOPLE CHERISH THE BEGINNING OF THE CRAB SEASON IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA. IS PEOPLE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EQUALLY LOVE THE OPENER FOR THE LOBSTER SEASON. AND LITERALLY THE MOMENT WE STARTED TO SWING INTO ACTION ON THIS BILL THE WEEKEND OF OCTOBER SECOND AND THIRD. WAS THE SAME TIME WE WERE GETTING READY TO OPEN THESE WATERS TO THE LOBSTER FISHERY IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. SO THE MIDDLE OF OCTOBER WE GOT OUT IN THE WATER AND GET THE FIRST ONE SHORT FINNED FISH AND MUSSELS SAMPLING. OCTOBER TWENTY SECOND TWENTY FOURTH WE DID THIS SECOND MUSCLE SAMPLING. FROM THE TWENTY SECOND OF THE THIRTIETH WE DID OUR FIRST OFFSHORE SAMPLING NEAR SHORE DEEP TRAWL DIVERS TRAPS YOU PFDS. ALL THOSE. TAMPA HAVE BEEN SHIPPED TO THE QUALIFIED LAB. NOVEMBER SECOND THIRD WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF OUR THIRD MUSCLES SAMPLING. SAMPLING TIME LINES ARE REALLY DRIVEN BY TIDE SAFETY WEATHER CONDITIONS THE SAMPLES HAVE DON SPINY LOBSTER ROCK CRAB HALIBUT ROCKFISH VIRGIN BAIT FISH SPECIES MUSSELS PRAWNS REVIEWS COMMERCIAL VESSELS AND FISSURES TO HELP OUT HERE THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT TO NOTE. ON THIS IS ONE OF THE FIRST BEST TIMES WE'VE INCORPORATED IMMEDIATE ENGAGEMENT WITH MIKE CONROY AND OTHERS ON THE BEACH SIDE WE'VE WORKED WITH LOCAL FISHERIES LEADERSHIP TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO USE THEIR FORCE DEPLOYMENT OUT CAPTURING THESE SAMPLES HERE'S THE DEAL THOUGH THERE'S A TURNAROUND TIME CHALLENGE HERE BECAUSE ONLY A FEW LAPS QUALIFIED TO DO THIS WORK. YOU ACTUALLY HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DETECT TRACE LEVELS OF HYDROCARBONS AND TEST FOR HYDROCARBONS. RELATIVE TO PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. THERE ARE THINGS WE THINK WE CAN DO TO BETTER PREPARE FOR A NEXT BILL. LIKE HOW WE MIGHT REOPEN USING PHASES OR HOW MIGHT WE STREAMLINED THE SAMPLING EFFORT BUT IT'S REALLY NOT- BIBLE STICKS TO THINK ABOUT. BUILDING ANOTHER LAB OR LAB CAPACITY TO DEAL WITH THIS TECHNOMIC SO AS OF RIGHT NOW. ALL GOES WELL THINGS COME OUR WAY WE MIGHT BE LOOKING AT AN ABILITY TO DISCLOSURE DEALT WITH THEN REMOVED AS WE GET TO THE END OF THIS. MAYBE STOP SCHERING SCREEN AND LATER TURNED TO. THE NEXT TOPIC IT IS A DIRECTOR AT IS WHEN I DO A QUICK TIME CHECK SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HIT DUNGENESS CRAB WHEN I IN THE DELAY IN IF YOU CAN COVER ALL ISSUES IN REGARDS TO THE PRESENCE OF WALES IN. WHEN THE LATEST FLIGHTS WERE NOT TO BE ABLE TO MONITOR WELL SITUATION I WANNA MAKE SURE YOU HIT THE WINNING RUN IN SACRAMENTO AND WE CAN. OPEN IT UP FOR QUESTIONS AS WELL JUST BECAUSE THE TIME BUT- LONG TURNED BACK OVER TO YOU MR DIRECTOR YEP I WAS OLY GONNA DO THREE ISSUES EVEN THOUGH THE LONG LISTS FROM STUFF AND JUST DEAL WITH THE OTHER THINGS AND CAN AND SO LET ME TURN TO DROUGHT. AND WINTER RUN. IT'S GRAHAM. IT'S IS WORSE AS I'VE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER IT'S WORSE. RIGHT NOW THAN IT WAS IN THE MIDDLE OF THE LAST ROW. NINE TWENTY TWENTY AND TWENTY TWENTY ONE WATER YEARS ARE THE SECOND DRIEST TWO YEAR PERIODS IN THE HISTORICAL RECORD IN CALIFORNIA. SO FORGET ABOUT THE NINETEEN SEVENTY JOB THIS IS WORSE THAN THAT ALL OF OUR MAJOR FEDERAL AND STATE RESERVOIRS SHASTA OR GO FULL SOME. HAVE SEVERELY LOW STORAGE WE ARE IN A HOLE HYDROLOGICALLY. THE RECENT RAIN IS SUPER THANKFUL. BUT WE CAN'T COUNT ON IT WITH SUCH A HYDROLOGICAL HOLE TO DIG OUT OF WE WOULD BE ABLE TO CALL KNOW WHAT LEVELS OF RAIN NO WAS ARC LEVELS OF RAIN TO GET OUT OF THE DROUGHT WERE. IN SEVEN FACE A SERIES OF THREATS YOU'VE GOT THE ONGOING DROUGHT CONDITIONS. YOU'VE GOT A LONG TERM DECLINE IN POPULATIONS. WE HAD CONSECUTIVE DRY YEARS OR SEVEN ZERO NINE THIRTEEN THROUGH FIFTEEN. WE HAVE COMPETING INTERESTS FOR SCARCE WATER. LOOTING HOW WE MANAGE THE SCARCE RESOURCE IS AND WE HAVE RECENT DYNAMICS LIKE INCREASED EFFICIENCY AND SALMON DIETS OUT OF THE OCEAN THOSE THINGS CONTRIBUTE TO THE STATISTICAL REPORT UK FROM OUR FEDERAL AGENTS YOU KNOW. SURVIVAL IN THE SINGLE DIGITS WE CANNOT GET RECOVERED SALMON POPULATIONS IS EVERY SEVERAL YEARS WE EXPERIENCE A DYNAMIC WHERE WE HAVE SURVIVALS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS THE POPULATION IS ON ITS LONG SLOW DECLINE SOME YEARS WITHIN THAT ARE GOOD. AS AN EXAMPLE THIS CURRENT YEAR HAS ACTUALLY BEEN PRETTY GOOD FOR FISHING- ON ON SOME OF THE FRONTS WE HAD A FIRE THEN USUAL RETURNS UP YOU CREEK IS A GOOD EXAMPLE WE HAD BETTER THAN PREDICTED FISHING IN THE COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL SPACE BUT THAT'S BECAUSE THOSE FISH THAT HAVE JUST COME BACK. CAME IN WERE BORN IN WAR WERE KIND OF RUNNING THROUGH OUR RIVERS WENT BY RIVER LEVELS ARE HIGHER THE CURRENT DROUGHT SITUATION IS LIKELY TO PRODUCE VERY BAD RETURNS OF FINISH REAR FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND IF WE KEEP HAVING. THESE INCREDIBLY BAD YEARS WE WILL NOT DIG OUT OF OUR POPULATION DECLINE THAT'S JUST THE REALITY WE'VE GOT TO ACCEPT THAT REALITY. SO WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO WITH THE DEPARTMENT THIS YEAR TRY TO MANAGE THROUGH THIS YEAR. WE'RE GOING TO SPEND A LOT OF MONEY THANK YOU ON THE SUBCOMMITTEE SENATOR MCGUIRE AND THE SENATE AND ASSEMBLY EVENTUALLY APPROVED THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS AND THE GOVERNOR SIGNED WEDNESDAY ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS IN COVER REDIRECTING TWENTY SIX STAFF. WE'RE GONNA BE IN THE FIELD AROUND THE CLOCK DOING FISH RESCUE INSTRUCTOR MONITORING ON ALL OF OUR SENTINEL STREETS GOING TO TAKE ABOUT NINE MILLION DOLLARS AND DO ALMOST FORTY PROJECTS ACROSS FOURTEEN HATCHERIES. REPLACING ALL KIND OF INEFFICIENT OUTDATED NOT MODERNIZED EQUIPMENT TO TRY TO GET OUR HATCHERIES IN A STATE THEY CAN HELP US BRIDGE NEXT YEAR. WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO DO MORE THAN THAT WILL TAKE ABOUT SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS AND MODERNIZE ALL PARTS OF OUR HATCHERY FLEETS ARE FISH STOCKING TRUCKS AND TRAILERS ARE FEED VEHICLES ARE FISH FEEDERS WE WILL BE ABLE TO GET ALL OF THAT UP TO A MODERNIZED STATE. SHORTLY WHERE IT'S ALL FIVE YEARS OR YOUNGER AS TO THAT EQUIPMENT. WE NEED TO DO MORE WE HAVE TO GO TO EACH OF OUR HATCHERIES. AND WE HAVE A RUNNING LIST. AND DEAL WITH CAN. STRATEGIES WE NO LONGER CAN COUNT ON COLD WATER FROM RESERVOIRS COMING INTO OUR HATCHERIES KEEPING THE WATER COOLING. TO SURVIVE A HATCHERY OPERATIONS WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH CONTINGENCIES IN YOUR DISTRICT SENATOR YOU KNOW. WITH THE ARMY CORPS WE EFFECTIVELY LOST TEMPERATURE CONTROLLED THE WARM SPRINGS FISH HATCHERY AND WE HAD TO TAKE THE REMAINING COHO BROODSTOCK. AND SEND IT TO A LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL TO STEWARD UNTIL WE CAN FIX THE INFRASTRUCTURE PROBLEM. WE ARE DEVELOPING SIMILAR CONTINGENCY STRATEGIES FOR ALL OF OUR ASSETS RIGHT NOW. BY THE TIME WE GET OUT OF THE END OF THIS CALENDAR YEAR AND ARE PREPARED FOR NEXT YEAR. WE WILL BE INCREASING OUR FISH PRODUCTION JUST ON TUESDAY I ANNOUNCED WE'RE GOING TO. LOSE ANOTHER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ADDITIONAL. BALL ROUNDED OUR NIMBUS FISH HATCHERY IN THE AMERICAN AS A MEASURE TO KEEP ALIVE BEFALL RUN FOR OUR HARD WORKING MEN AND WOMEN IN THE OCEAN WHO STILL RELY ON. FOR THEIR LIVELIHOOD. WE'RE GONNA BE IN A POSITION WHERE WE'RE PREPARED TO GET IN NEXT YEAR TO TRUCK ABOUT SEVENTEEN MILLION FISH. FROM THE FOUR MAJOR CENTRAL VALLEY HATCHERIES OUT TO OUR ESTUARIES. BUT THIS WILL JUST BE THE BAND. IT'S TIME TO DO THE THINGS WHICH ARE POTENTIALLY A REAL THINGS THAT WILL HELP US ON THE ROAD TO RECOVERY NOT AVOIDING JUST EXTINCTION. WE NEED TO GET FRESH OUT OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOR IF THEY STAY STUCK ON THE CENTRAL VALLEY FLOOR WE'RE GONNA RUN OUT OF COLD WATER YEAR AFTER YEAR LOOKING THROUGH THE DECADES IS JUST A REALITY DEALING WITH CLIMATE IMPACTS WE NEED TO GET THEM INTO THEIR HISTORICAL HABITAT. WE'VE GOT A SIX ON THIS PASSAGE PROBLEMS IN BUTTE CREEK AND GET BETTER MORE SUCCESSFULLY TO THE UPPER PART OF THE SYSTEM FASTER WE'VE GOT TO GET DOWN THE REMAINING THINGS WITH PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC COMPANY IN BATTLE CREEK AND MAKE BATTLE CREEK A REFUGIO FOR CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON AS WELL. FRANKLY NEXT YEAR WE OUGHT ALSO GO AHEAD PUT FISH IN THE MCLEOD RIVER ABOVE SHASTA DAM FOR THE FIRST TIME TO DO SOME SCIENCE IF WE CAN DO IT IF WE CAN'T GET THE FISH THERE WE ALREADY LEASED DEPLOYED THE EQUIPMENT. AND GET THE INFRASTRUCTURE TESTED OUT SO WE CAN DO A PRETTY PROBLEM WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO GET SALMON INTO OTHER TRIBUTARIES LIKE THE FEATHER OR MAYBE THE U. BUT AS WELL IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A CHANCE AT BEATING THIS POPULATION DECLINE IN THE BIG PICTURE. THOSE ARE A FEW OF THE THINGS ON MY MIND LET ME TURN TO CRAP AND HOPEFULLY I'LL GET OUT OF THE WAY WITHIN THE TEN MINUTES SO THE RECREATIONAL TANK ATTENTIONS GRAB USING CRAB TRAPS IN BASICALLY FROM SOME MOMENTOUS. YOU KNOW DOWN TO POINTS OR- I WENT. TO MAKE SURE POINT LOOK POINT BE TEN. RESTRICT IN A NORMAL WORLD THE RECREATIONAL CRAB FISHERY WOULD HAVE COMMENCED THIS NOVEMBER SIX- THIS WEEKEND IT IS NOW DELAYED. AND THAT CENTRAL PART OF THE COAST IF YOU'RE UP ABOVE THE SONOMA COUNTY LINE YOU CAN GO AHEAD RECREATIONALLY FISH FOR DUNGENESS CRAB. IF YOU'RE BELOW THE POINT LOPEZ LINE YOU CAN GO AHEAD AND RECREATION AS FAST- EVER ALONG THE COAST RECREATIONALLY YOU CAN USE OTHER TYPES OF FISHING METHODS. THAT'S INCREDIBLE STAIRS RECREATIONALLY YOU CANNOT USE THE TRUCKS. ON THE COMMERCIAL FRONT AS THE SENATOR MENTIONED RIGHT NOW ALL WE ARE DELAYING THE COMMERCIAL OPENER IN THAT MIDDLE PART OF THE STATE. THE NORTHERN PART OF THE STATE IS HEADED TOWARDS POTENTIALLY A DECEMBER FIRST. QUALITY TESTING OF THE MEAT WHICH IS AN ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN THE THREE WEST COAST STATES. AND SOUTH OF LOPEZ POINT- I'M SINGLE HAND COMMERCIALLY FISH THE MIDDLE PART OF THE STATE NOT YET AND THE REASON IS WE'RE MANAGING. A CHANGE IN OUR OCEAN WHICH FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AS EITHER GIVEN US A DEMO LIKE ACID DELAY FOR COMMERCIAL FISHING WORE A DELAY BECAUSE OF PRESENCE OF WHALES AND SEA TURTLES. SO THE MOST RECENT INFORMATION I HAVE FROM YESTERDAY AROUND- WE CONVERT MILITARY HOURS AROUND THREE PM. SO WE'VE BEEN DOING ADDITIONAL WELL SURVEYS WE HAVE INFORMATION COMING IN FROM OCTOBER THIRTY AND THIRTY ONE FROM CASCADIA RESEARCH. SHOWING A CONTINUED PRESENCE OF HUMPBACK WHALES IN HIGH NUMBERS IN FISHING ZONES THREE AND FOUR THE RECENT STORM APPEARS TO NOT HAVE CLEARED OUT THOSE WHALES- SURVEYS SHOW UP TO SEVENTY NINE WHALES IN ZONE THREE AND TWENTY WHALES IN ZONE FOR. BOTH OF THOSE CAN LEVELS EXCEED THE TRIGGERS IN OUR REGULATIONS WE'RE ALSO SEEING INFORMATION COMING IN FROM THE MONTEREY BAY A WHALE WATCH THAT SAYS WE'RE ABOVE TRIGGER LEVELS WE FLEW OUR OWN DEPARTMENT PLANE ON THE SECOND TWO DAYS AGO. REALLY POOR WEATHER LIMITED- VALUE OF THAT FLIGHT BUT WE DID OBSERVE WHALES HUMPBACKS IN SOME FREE. WE'RE GONNA TRY TO FLY AGAIN AS MUCH AS WE CAN. CURRENTLY THE WEATHER FORECASTS INDICATES LOW CLOUDS AND FOG. WHICH MAKES OUR VISIBILITY FROM THE AIR VERY DIFFICULT. I'M COGNIZANT OF TIME- SOONER JUST LET ME CONCLUDE ON THE CROP FRONT AND SAY FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE BEEN APPLYING THIS APPROACH THIS IS THE SECOND YEAR UNDER FORMALIZE REGULATIONS FOR THE COMMERCIAL FLEET. IT'S THE FIRST TIME FOR THE RECREATIONAL FISHERY WE KNOW THIS IS DIFFICULT CHANGE TAKES TIME. WHERE SHOULD HAVE OF OUR PARTNERSHIPS ON BOTH THE RECREATIONAL AND COMMERCIAL FLEET. THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS WHERE WE'RE COLLABORATING EACH TIME OF THIS YEAR TO TRY AND GET PEOPLE FISHING AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. WHILE MINIMIZING IMPACTS TO MAJESTIC MARINE MAMMALS WHALES AND OTHER BACKSEAT TURTLES. IN A REPORT OF LETTING GO TOO MUCH OVER. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER DIRECTOR THAT'S CHUCK BONHAM DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FISH WILDLIFE WHAT I'D LIKE TO BE TO DO IS I'M GONNA START OFF WITH CENTER WAY SO THEN I'D LIKE TO GET INTO SOME QUESTIONS COMMENTS IN REGARD TO SALMON AND CRAB A CERTAIN WAY SO. AFTERNOON. THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA THANK THE DIRECTOR FOR THAT WONDERFUL PRESENTATION. AND I THANK HIM FOR RESPONDING TO THE SALMON ISSUE RELATED TO- SACRAMENTAL- JUST FOLLOWING UP THE LOOP YOU KNOW HIGH- WE GOT WE GOT TO SEE HOW. OVER THE YEARS WE'VE EXPERIENCED IN A SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE I GUESS- PRACTICALLY NO SALMON ANYMORE WHERE THERE USED TO BE AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT I'D HATE TO HAVE THAT HAPPEN OR NORTH OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WE SEE THAT HAPPENING TO SACRAMENTO- DO DO WE EXPECT THAT. AT SOME POINT WE WILL NO LONGER SEE SALMON. ALONG THE SACRAMENTO DELTA IS US IS THAT SOMETHING THAT IS JUST. A FLAT REALITY THAT WE HAVE TO ACCEPT. NOW I REJECT THAT AS A. A FATE ACCOMPLI AND I'LL POINT TO YOUR HOME THE REGION AS THE EXAMPLE. WHILE THEY MAY BE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN WE STILL HAVE SOUTHERN STILL HAD RECESS IN WHAT ARGUABLY IS THE BIGGEST MEGALOPOLIS IN THE WORLD FROM- THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER UP TO SANTA BARBARA. SOMETIMES FISH SOUTHERN STILL HAD HEARTY VERSIONS OF SALMON SWIM BACK INTO. MALIBU CREEK OR- TRIBUTE GO CREEK OR- DALY RIVER OR VENTURA RIVER. THEY PERSIST PERSIST OVER TIME NATURE IS STRONG FOR JUST GIVE HER HALF A CHANCE AND GIVING OUR HAVE THE CHANCE INCLUDES THINGS LIKE WE'RE GONNA TAKE OUT SOME A DAM IN MATTEL HOT CREEK TRIBUTARY TO THE VENTURA RIVER AND OPEN UP ACCESS TO SOUTHERN STILL HAD. AND IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING TO COMPLETE IT'LL BE THE END OF MAY BUT COMPLETE THE WORLD'S BIGGEST DAM REMOVAL RIVER RESTORATION PROJECT ON THE KLAMATH. AND OPEN UP THAT RIVER ABOUT THREE HUNDRED PLUS MILES HISTORICAL HABITAT TO STAND STILL. IF WE GIVE NATURE IN THESE FISHES CHANCE BABY WILL SURVIVE. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY IT'S- COMPLICATED BY THE FACT IN MIND YOU. THESE FISH ARE LIMITED TO LIVING ON THE TOP. FLOOR AND DAMS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT FOR WATER IN THE STATE WATER PROJECT ARE SO LARGE AND INDISPENSABLE FOR HUMAN HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE ARE STUCK IN A SITUATION THINKING ABOUT WATER MANAGEMENT OF THE SCARCE RESOURCE IN A WARMING CLIMATE. AND THESE FISH CANNOT ACCESS HISTORICAL HABITAT I THINK WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TURN TO THE OPTION OF PUTTING THEM BACK ABOVE RIM DOWNS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY. BUT THEY SHOW AS THEY CAN SURVIVE WE JUST HAVE TO GIVE ME A CHANCE SO I REJECT THE IDEA WE'RE GONNA LOSE CENTRAL VALLEY SALMON AND STEELHEAD. I DON'T THINK WE HAVE RECOVERED PABLO POPULATIONS WITHOUT A WHOLE HECK OF A LOT OF HARD WORK. AND TRYING THINGS AND BEEN WILLING TO TRY AS A SOCIETY. ALSO JUST VERY BRIEFLY A MORE POSITIVE- SUBJECT YOU HAVE OVERSEEN- THE KLAMATH RIVERS RESTORATION IN THE- ELIMINATION OF THE KLAMATH DAM- THAT THIS- LEGISLATURE FUNDED I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD PROVIDE US AN UPDATE ON HOW THAT PROJECT IS GOING AND- WHAT ITS CONTRIBUTION IS GOING TO BE. GOING TO BE TWO SEVEN RUNS. I THINK THE CONTRIBUTION WILL BE IMMENSE I DON'T RECALL OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD BUT THE PROJECTED MODELS FOR FREE FLOWING RIVER AND REBOUND OF POPULATIONS OVER TIME IT'S QUITE LARGE. AT A PROCESSING LEVEL WE ARE DOWN TO COMPLETING THE ELEMENTS OF THIS DECONSTRUCTION BUT- THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION IS PREPARING ITS FINAL NATIONAL ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY ACT ENVIRONMENTAL DOCUMENT APPROVING WE HOPE REMOVAL. WE EXPECT THAT- NEXT SPRING AND SUMMER WE'RE COMPLETING ALL OF THE RELEVANT STATE AND FEDERAL- ANTI US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS THE STATE WATER BOARD. RECENTLY THIS SUMMER THE FEDERAL ENERGY REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVED TRANSFERRING THE LICENSE FOR THESE DAMS FROM PACIFIC CORE THE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY TO THE CORPORATION AND THE STATES OF OREGON AND CALIFORNIA FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF REMOVAL. WE ARE IN THE MIDDLE OF WORKING WITH OUR TRAVEL PARTNERS AND LOCAL COUNTIES TO DEAL WITH ANY POTENTIAL IMPACTS FROM A BIG CONSTRUCTION PROJECT MORE ON PATH. TO DRAW DOWN RESERVOIRS AND REMOVE THESE DAMS BEGINNING AS SOON AS- THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY THREE. SO THAT IS A VERY OPTIMISTIC HOPE CENTER ARSON LARGE PART BECAUSE YOUR COMMITMENTS AND REQUIRES. SIMPLY NUMBER ONCE AND THE FINANCIAL FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE IS PROVIDED FOR THE PROJECT. THANK YOU NOT FOR SAPAN I JUST WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE TO OUR STATE ALL THESE YEARS AND ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS YOU'VE DONE. I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO BRINGING YOU BACK TO DECLINE A REBELLION PUTTING YOU BACK ON A HORSE AGAIN FOR YOU TO EXHIBIT. YOUR WONDERFUL EGGS THE QUESTION SKILLS TO ALL OF US. I'LL TRY NOT TO FALL OFF THE NEXT TIME WE DO THAT IN THE FUTURE. I THINK THE RUBY STORY THERE IT WHICH I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO HEARING- SELLING THANK YOU SO MUCH EITHER WAY SO AND DAD PLEASE BRING PICTURE SIR THAT'S FANTASTIC. I HOPE THERE'S NO PICTURES THERE YOU GO- I THINK THE FOCUS ON THE SCENE I MEAN LOOK I THINK THAT- WE'RE BEGINNING TO WATCH. THE EXTINCTION OF A CONDUCT SPECIES RIGHT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES. IN EACH YEAR IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE FOR SALMON HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE. BUT I'M ALSO A FIRM BELIEVER THAT ANTIQUATED FEDERAL WATER POLICIES CONTRIBUTED. TO THIS SPECIES DECLINE IN OLD CEMENT. DIE OFF BUT THAT WAS ALL OF US ARE SEEN I HAVE A SEVEN MONTH OLD AT HOME AND I AM VERY CONCERNED THAT HE WILL NEVER SEE. SALMON THAT WHEN A RUN IN THE SACRAMENTO. SO THERE ARE THERE'S SOME MOVEMENT PIVOTING AWAY FROM THE TRUMP ERA BIOLOGICAL OPINION FOR CENTRAL VALLEY BUT WE STILL SEE THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT PROCESS IN PLACE IN THE SACRAMENTO. WHAT DO YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT MR DIRECTOR BECAUSE I'M A FIRM BELIEVER I THINK THERE ARE. CONSERVATION ORGANIZATIONS UP AND DOWN THE STATE THAT FIRMLY BELIEVES THAT. FEDERAL WATER POLICY HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN ADDITION TO THE DROUGHT. AND ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE CAN'T COUNT ON COLD WATER. IS BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF THE PAST SO MISTER DIRECTOR YOU WANT TO COMMENT ON THAT. YES I'M BECAUSE YOU ASK- I'LL BE DIRECTING GIVE YOU MY VIEW SO. AS MOST PARTICIPATING TO KNOW TODAY REALIZE- THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY AND OUR STATE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. AND THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THROUGH THE CAPACITY OF OUR ATTORNEY GENERAL. DID CHALLENGE IN FEDERAL COURT WHAT ARE CALLED THE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IT'S A FANCY WORD FOR OPERATING RULES. FOR THE- FEDERAL CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. AND RECENTLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS AGREED AND INFORM THE FEDERAL COURT THAT IT WILL GO BACK AND REDO THOSE RULES. I THINK THAT'S AN IMPORTANT OUTCOME I THINK MANY IN THIS PHONE CALL THAT MAY PRESENT ON SUBSEQUENT PANELS HAVE BEEN ADVOCATING FOR THAT OUTCOME. SO WE'LL END UP WITH NEW OPERATING RULES THAT GOVERN THE FEDERAL WATER PROJECT. MY HOPE IS THAT THOSE RULES CAN BE DEVELOPED IN COLLABORATION ACROSS ALL AGENCIES BIOLOGICAL AGENCIES AND WATER. BY AGENCIES THAT THEY WILL ACCOUNT FOR ACTIVE MEASURES THEY GIVE US A SENSE OF IN ANY PLANNING CYCLE HOW WILL HAVE PROTECTIVE THRESHOLDS FOR SALMON AND STEELHEAD. MY HOPE IS THAT WE'LL HAVE AN APPROACH THAT THINKS THROUGH THE INTEGRATION OF ALL THESE MAJOR RESERVOIRS RELATIVE TO COLD WATER AND HOW YOU MANAGE RESERVOIRS. AND MY HOPE IS THE OUTCOME WILL BE A MORE STABLE CENTER RULES. STABLE FOR WATER SUPPLY BUT ALSO MORE PROTECTIVE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO. WORK THROUGH THAT IT'S GONNA TAKE A COUPLE OF YEARS THESE ARE NOT. PROCESS SEES THAT SWITCH OVER NINE. IN THE INTERIM MY OWN PERSONAL VIEWIS NEXT CALENDAR YEAR OF THIS WATER YEAR. MOST PEOPLE ARE ON THE PHONE CALL I THINK REALIZE WATER YEARS RUN FROM. YEAH END OF OCTOBER THROUGH THE FOLLOWING. AND I THINK NEXT YEAR IS GOING TO BE JUST FINE USUAL UNPRECEDENTED WE ARE LOOKING AT THE HOUSE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A THIRD JURAI CRITICALLY DRY HYDROLOGICALLY ON PRESIDENT CHALLENGING YEAR. AND WE NEED TO THINK ABOUT NEXT YEAR MINE MINE OUTSIDE OUR USUAL STATUS QUO MENTALITY WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT RISK MANAGEMENT WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHAT IS OUR- MOST IMAGINABLE. WORST CASE SCENARIO AND THEN BE READY TO DEAL WITH THAT AND I THINK WE CAN. YEAH NO NINE AND MR GEORGE I THINK WE WERE A 100% AGREEMENT IN NIGHT- AND I DON'T EVER WANT TO SPEAK FOR THE DIRECTOR OR THE AGENCY BUT- I THINK HE WANTS TO MOVE WITH SPEED I JUST DON'T KNOW IF WE HAVE TIME. TO BE ABLE TO GO THROUGH TRADITIONAL RULE MAKING PROCESS AND WE KNOW THAT THIS SPECIES ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION IN IS ABSOLUTELY ON THE BRINK OF EXTINCTION TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN. WAS BAD- TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN WAS BAD IT KEEPS GETTING WORSE AND NOW WE'RE GONNA BE GOING THROUGH A RULEMAKING PROCESS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE STILL HAVE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS BY THE WAY IN THE SACRAMENTO. IN THAT WHOLE WINTER RUN- IS ABSOLUTELY THREATENED TO GO EXTINCT HERE IN THE COMING YEARS AND SO I HAVE DEEP CONCERNS. ABOUT HOW LONG THIS IS GOING TO TAKE- AND WHAT THE RAMIFICATIONS ARE. IF WE DON'T MOVE WITH SPEED. THAT SO WHICH IS WHICH IS WHY FOR NOW YEAR- I THINK OUR APPROACH NEXT YEAR HAS TO INVOLVE PRIVATIZATION I THINK WE AS CALIFORNIANS NEED TO BE THINKING FIRST ABOUT. WATER FOR PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE CANDEAL WITH PEOPLE HAVE WATER AT THEIR TOP. THEN I THINK WENEED TO BE LOOKING AT WHEN A RUN IN THE SALMON RIVER. ARE IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER MANY THINKING ABOUT TEMPERATURE CRITERIA. AND MANAGING FOR THAT BECAUSE THESE FISH MAY NOT BE ABLE TO TOLERATE A THIRD YEAR LIKE THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND AFTER WE WORK THROUGH THAT PRIVATIZATION WE NEED TO BE THINKING ABOUT OUR RESERVOIRS. THERE CARRY OVER AS WE HEAD INTO THE FOLLOWING CALENDAR YEAR AND THEN DEALING WITH ALL THE VERY IMPORTANT USES OF WATER OUR AGRICULTURAL COMMUNITY OUR WILDLIFE REFUGES BUT WE'RE GONNA NEED SOME. FORM OF PRIVATIZATION THAT ALLOWS US TO LOOK AT PUBLIC HEALTH AND SAFETY AND THEN TRY TO FOCUS IN AFTER THAT ON THESE WINTER RUNS THE OTHER CHALLENGE THAT WE HAVE IN THIS IS. NOT WITHIN. THE DIRECTORS. PURVIEW IS THAT YOU KNOW THE STATE. I HAD IMPLEMENTED NEW WATER FLOW RULES BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN YET WE HAVEN'T IMPLEMENTED THOSE NEW WATER FLOW RULES THAT WOULD PROVIDE A COLD WATER SOURCE- AND IN THE MEANTIME. I'M GONNA KEEP GOING BACK TO WHAT WERE SEEN AND AGAIN THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE. WE CONTINUE TO SEE SPECIES GOING EXTINCT EXTINCT IN FRONT OF OUR EYES RIGHT NOW- AND IT IS ICONIC FISHERY IN THE STATE IT IS ABSOLUTELY IMPERATIVE THAT WE MOVE WITH SPEED WE HAVE RULES THAT WE COULD USE. A AND FOR SOME REASON HAVE NOT BEEN ENACTED INTO DEEP CONCERN WE'LL ALSO HEAR FROM- ENVIRONMENTAL AND CONSERVATION LEADERS IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS IN OUR NEXT PANEL FOCUS ON THE DROUGHT CRISIS IN SALMON FISHERIES IN AND I DON'T WANNA LEAVE THIS DISCUSSION LET ME SIMPLY BEING CRITICAL BECAUSE I GOTTA SAY DIRECTOR BONHAM HIS TEAMMATE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE. WORKING IN PARTNERSHIP WITH THE LEGISLATURE QUITE FRANKLY OF PROVIDING THE DEPARTMENT WITH THE FUNDING THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO MOVE WITH SPEED TO BE ABLE TO SAVE THIS SPECIES WITH A BAND AID APPROACH RIGHT HEARING ABOUT TRUCKING LITERALLY SEVENTEEN MILLION. FISHERY HATCHED SALMON AND PUTTING THEM IN THE ACTUARIES TO ENSURE THEIR SURVIVAL IS CRITICAL BUT IT IS NOT A LONG TERM STRATEGY FOR SUCCESS AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT LONG TERM POLICY CHANGES OBVIOUSLY LOOKING HEALTH ND SAFETY OF RESIDENTS FIRST BUT THEN ALSO FOCUSING ON THIS ICONIC FISH SPECIES HERE IN CALIFORNIA. I I'D LIKE TO- JUST BECAUSE THE TIME MISTER. DIRECTOR I'D LIKE TO JUMP TO. ALL ISSUES OF IS. LOOK I'M JUST GOING TO BE BLUNT TONIGHT I DON'T HAVE A CRYSTAL BALL BUT I'M VERY NERVOUS MISTER DIRECTOR ABOUT HITTING THAT THANKSGIVING MARKET- FOR- DIGENIS CRAB. WE'RE LOOKING AT THE MAJORITY DUNGEONS CRABS CONSUME BETWEEN- THANKSGIVING AND THE END OF THE YEAR- YOUR CRYSTAL BALL NOW SIR AND I KNOW YOU DON'T LIKE MAKING PREDICTIONS. BUT I THINK IT IS IN A FULL COURT PRESS TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS FISHERY OPENED. AT A MINIMUM AT A MINIMUM- FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON WHEN IT COMES TO- CHRISTMAS. THE NEW YEAR AND HANUKKAH- BUT I'M NERVOUS IN REGARDS TO THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY AREA MONTEREY BAY AS WELL AS A CINEMA IN MARIN COUNTY'S. BECAUSE OF THE PRESENCE OF WALES IS THAT A- CORRECT ASSESSMENT IN REGARDS TO HITTING THESE GIVING BUT REALLY TRYING TO PUSH FOR THE HOLIDAY SEASON FOR CHRISTMAS. I'M NERVOUS LIKE YOU YEAH. I'VE LIVED THROUGH THE LAST COUPLE YEARS WITH YOU- I THINK RIGHT NOW. WE JUST NEED TO ACCEPT THE CALENDAR SPACE BETWEEN NOVEMBER FOURTH. AND THANKSGIVING IS SHRINKING AND THERE'S A LT OF STUFF WE HAVE TO DO ON OUR SIDE. RELATIVE TO THAT KIND OF THANKSGIVING MARKER WE NEED TO KEEP GETTING IN THE AIR AS MUCH AS WE CAN FOR AERIAL SURVEYS THAT TAKES GETTING UP THERE WEATHER PERMITTING PROCESSING THAT DATA WE NEED TO KEEP OPEN THE OTHER INFORMATION STREAMS LIKE CASCADIA. WHALE WATCH BUT THEN WE WOULD NEED TO PROCESS ALL THAT INFORMATION. WE HAVE A RISK ASSESSMENT. MOMENT ON THE CALENDAR WITH THE COLLABORATIVE WORKING GROUP COMMERCIAL RECREATIONAL CONSERVATION GROUPS IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED I THINK FOR NOVEMBER A- WE NEED TO THEN. ENGAGE THE WORKING GROUP WE NEED TO TURN AROUND RECOMMENDATIONS AND WE NEED TO GO BACK OUT FOR NOTICE BECAUSE THAT'S THE WAY THE RULES AND LAWS WORK. EVEN IF WE GOT SUPER FORTUNATE AND THE WHALES AND TURTLES OF ACTUALLY DEPARTED. IT WOULD STILL BE A VERY TIGHT SQUEEZE TO TRY TO GET ALL THAT DONE BEFORE THANKSGIVING IT'S POSSIBLE. WE SHOULD HOLD OUT HOPE THAT HOPE IS NOT A STRATEGY. SO I THINK SIMULTANEOUSLY AT THE DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE AN EYE ON THANKSGIVING BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN EYE ON YOU KNOW THE END OF DECEMBER I THINK ANNIKA'S MUCH EARLIER THIS YEAR BUT LET'S SAY MID IN DECEMBER STARTED THE NEW YEAR. SADLY A COUPLE OF THE LAST CYCLES WE'VE MISSED ALL THE HOLIDAY SEASON. GETTING A NEW YEAR. SO WE HAVE AN EYE ON THANKSGIVING BUT WE ALSO HAVE AN EYE ON THAT DECEMBER PERIOD AND IF WE CAN'T GET THANKSGIVING WE ARE TRYING TO WORK TOWARDS DECEMBER. YOU KNOW THIS- WE HAVE TRIED THIS SEVERAL TIMES THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS AND WHEN THE DEPARTMENT. GEARS OUT I'M A GUYVER WAY BALANCE WHALES AND GET THE FLEET SOAP AND OCCASIONALLY THE FLEET HAS DECIDED THEY DON'T WANT TO GO FISH. SO I'M SUPER NERVOUS WE'LL TRY THIS AGAIN AND THE FLEET. CURRENT IS IN THE EYE WITH A FINGER AT THE END OF THE DAY SO WE'VE GOT TO WORK THROUGH IT TOGETHER. HAVE ANY CHANCE OF GETTING BOATS OUT COMMERCIALLY IT'S TIME FOR THE END OF THE YEAR HOLIDAYS LET ALONE THANKSGIVING YEAH WHAT I'M HOPING IS BECAUSE- FROZEN STOCK HAS BEEN DEPLETED BECAUSE THE BLEAK YEAR LAST YEAR- THERE ISN'T A LOT OF. SUPPLY LEFT- IN FREEZERS FOR FROM PROCESSORS WHICH MEANS I'M HOPING THAT PRICE YEAH I'M JUST GOING TO BE VERY BLUNT HERE MISTER DIRECTOR I'M HOPING THAT PRICES AT A GOOD POINT SO THAT THE FLEET CAN GO OUT ABOUT ONCE WHALES HAVE MOVED SOUTH FOR THE WINTER- AND WE CAN GET THIS SEASON KICKED OFF. BECAUSE I THINK THT'S BEEN ONE OF THE UNDERTONES OF THIS TOO IS OBVIOUSLY THE FLEET HAS DONE ALL THEY CAN AND I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU BECAUSE THE FLEET IS STEPPED UP BIG TIME TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH THE STATE TO INSURE THAT THERE ISN'T A PRESENCE OF WHALES AND THEY BROUGHT THAT FOR THEMSELVES AND BY THE WAY WE'LL ENTANGLEMENTS. ARE DOWN AND MENTALLY OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS I THINK WE'RE AT LIKE SIXTY SEVEN OR SEVENTY TWO JUST FIVE YEARS AGO I THINK WE HAD ONE OR TWO LAST YEAR- MR DIRECTOR I MEAN IT IT'S DOWN CONSIDERABLY- AND I'M HOPING THAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE A GOOD PRICE YEAR SINCE THERE REALLY ISN'T ANY STOCK LEFT I'M GONNA GIVE YOU THE LAST WORD ON THAT MISTER DIRECTOR THIRTY SECONDS. TWO THINGS ELSE WE HAVE TO KEEP IN MIND WE DO HAVE SOME HOT CRAB SAMPLES IN THE SPACE OF DEMONIC ACID I UNDERSTAND THAT SURROUND THE RUSSIAN RIVER MOUTH. I THINK WE HAVE ONE AT EIGHT PM ONE THAT COULD YOU KNOW FACTOR INTO HOW WE OPEN. THE NORTHERN PORTION OF ZONE THREE. AND THEN- FOR THE LIFE OF ME I CAN'T REMEMBER WHAT MYSELF- I KNOW MY SECOND THOUGHT IS REMEMBER BECAUSE OF S. B. EIGHTY WE WILL NOW HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL NUANCES ON GIVING RECREATIONAL AS SOME DIFFERENT PRE SOAK AND HEAD START THAT COULD FACTOR INTO THE POTENTIAL FOR US GETTING COMMERCIAL OPEN BY THANKSGIVING. I'M GONNA WORK WE'RE GONNA WORK THROUGH AN HOURLY WE'RE ON THE PHONE ALL DAY LONG THIS TIME OF THE YEAR I CAN SET MY WATCH TO IT. AND I THANK YOUR STAFF CONSULTANTS AND YOU PERSONALLY AND EACH MEMBER OF THE FLEET BECAUSE IT'S THAT DATED A CONVERSATION THAT GIVES THE CHANCE TO BE CREATED. YEAH I KNOW YOU ACTUALLY READ VERY GRATEFUL TO THE HARDWORKING NO OPPENHEIM WHO DOES THE GOOD WORK AS A CHIEF CONSULTANT FOR THE COMMITTEE AS WELL AND- IN FACT AT THE TRACTOR AND I'M GOING TO BE ON A CALL LATER TODAY. TALKING ABOUT ALL ISSUES OF SALMON AND CRAB AND I DO APPRECIATE HIS AVAILABILITY AND HIS TEAM TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH ANALYTICS IN A WAY SO TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. MR DIRECTOR WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A CLOSING WORDS HERE. AND THEN WE'RE GONNA NEED TO BE ON THE MOVE TO OUR NEXT PANEL. ANY CLOSING COMMENTS MISTER DIRECTOR. TAKE CARE YOURSELF EVERYONE- IT'S BEEN A HECK OF A COUPLE YEARS AND I GOT INTO THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORK SPACE BECAUSE THE SALMON ACTUALLY TOOK SALMON LAW IN LAW SCHOOL AS I PUT MYSELF THROUGH LAW SCHOOL. AND I KNOW THAT IT CAN FEEL LIKE WE'RE IN THE BLEAKEST MOMENTS. WE CAN DO THIS CALIFORNIA SHOWS TIME AND TIME AGAIN. SO LET'S NOT LOSE THESE FISH THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT CHUCK BONHAM DIRECTOR FISH WILDLIFE VERY GRATEFUL MR BRYANT THANK YOU FOR MAKING YOURSELF AVAILABLE AND AGAIN I APOLOGIZE IN REGARDS TO THE DELAY- IN THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. SO YEAH HE ENDED IT THE DIRECTOR ENDED IT TALKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE THAT WE SAVE THIS ICONIC. FISHERY HERE IN THE GOLDEN STATE IN OUR NEXT PANEL IS GONNA BE FOCUSED IN ON THE DRUG CRISIS IN SALMON FISHERIES SO FIRST AND FOREMOST WE'RE GONNA HEAR FROM JOHN MCMANUS IS PRESIDENT OF THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION. WILL THEN HEAR FROM GEORGE BRAD SHOT HE'S PRESIDENT OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION AND THEN WE'LL- ROUNDED UP WITH DOUG- BGG HE'S AT HE'S SENIOR ATTORNEY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL SO WITHOUT FURTHER ADO WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MR MCMANUS FOR BEING WITH US TODAY. MR MCMANUS IS BACK WITH US TO PROVIDE REALLY A LIVING COLOUR UPDATE ON THE PLIGHT OF SALMON INTERSTATE NO ONE DOES THESE PRESENTATIONS BETTER HE DOES A DEEP DIVE QUICKLY AND IS ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH A LOT OF INFORMATION. AND I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MR MCMANUS AND OF COURSE TO THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION THEY HAVE BEEN TENACIOUS IN THEIR ADVOCACY. FOR NEW WATER RULES FOR CHALLENGES ON THE SECOND AND ON SO MANY OTHER TRIBUTARIES IN WATERSHEDS ACROSS THE STATE MR MCMANUS WE'RE GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE WITH US YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. YOUR PRESENTATION IF YOU DON'T MIND KICKING OFF THE DRUG CRISIS. IN SALMON FISHERIES THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SENATOR CAN YOU HEAR ME. THE COMPANY NOT PRETTY GOOD SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH WE SEE YOU CLEARLY IS WHAT WELCOME. STRAIGHT FIRST- I WOULD LIKE TO A- SUPPORT THE COMMENTS OF- DIRECTOR BOTTOM ABOUT THE NEED TO CONSIDER TRAPPING ALL PROGRAMS TO GET FISH ABOVE WRITTEN DOWNS- AS A NEXT STEP WOULD BE WONDERFUL TO SEE A PROPOSAL. COME FORWARD- FROM THE DEPARTMENT ON HOW TO DO THAT- DIRECTOR BOTTOM MENTIONED- BATTLE CREEK WELL NOT SO MUCH BATTLE CREEK BUT THE MCCLOUD RIVER ON THE SACRAMENTO. YEAH THERE ARE CERTAINLY SPOTS ON- BUTTE CREEK THE FEATHER RIVER AND THE YUBA RIVER. ALL WOULD INVITE THAT TYPE OF ACTION SO I JUST WANNA SAY THAT SOUNDS GOOD TO US AND WE WOULD LOVE TO PARTICIPATE I'M GONNA TRY AND SHARE MY SCREEN RIGHT NOW. AND ARE YOU SEE IN MY POWER POINT YOU ARE NOW UP AND RUNNING IF YOU WANT TO GO TO FULL SCREEN WE CAN SEE IT CLEARLY THANK YOU SO MUCH AS SEMANAS. GONNA TRY HERE- DID YOU SEE THAT YOU ARE GOOD IN GOLDEN PLEASE PROCEED SO THAT'S WHO WE ARE I'M NOT GONNA TAKE A LOT OF TIME THERE'S SO MANY TOPICS TO COVER I JUST HAD TO NARROW IT DOWN HOPEFULLY TO JUST A FEW TODAY FIRST OF ALL WE'D LIKE TO ASK- THE HELP OF THE COMMITTEE IN GETTING A REPORT EVENTUALLY FROM CDFW ON THE LOSS OF FALL RUN THIS YEAR WE EXPECT THERE WILL BE- PLENTY OF REPORTS ON THE LOSS OF THE LISTED WINTER AND SPRING RUN WE DON'T GET THOSE SAME TYPE OF REPORTS ON FALL RUN WITHOUT ASKING FOR ON. THIS COMMITTEE DID THIS ONCE BEFORE THE LAST DROUGHT WE'D ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE PURSUE THAT AGAIN. I WANT TO SHIFT OVER NOW AND SAY A FEW WORDS ABOUT THE FEATHER RIVER. COME TO OUR ATTENTION THAT THERE IS A REALLY BAD- DISEASE PATHOGEN IN THE FEATHER RIVER CALLED C. SHASTA. IT'S THE SAME DISEASE PATHOGEN THAT. ANNUALLY TAKES OUT. ALL KINDS OF JUVENILE SALMON ON THE KLAMATH RIVER. I'VE COME TO FIND OUT IT'S PROBABLY AS PREVALENT AND PERHAPS EVEN MORE SO IN THE FEATHER RIVER. AND IT AFFLICTS A JUVENILE FISH ON THEIR WAY OUT OF THE RIVER AND ITS LETHAL- IN A RECENT SURVEY I WAS TOLD THAT. OF FISH TRAP TO THE UPPER FEATHER RIVER AND RE TRAPPED A MERE FOURTEEN MILES DOWNSTREAM. ONLY 50% OF THEM SHOWED UP FOURTEEN MILES DOWNSTREAM THE REST FOR LOST. AND THOSE TRAPPED DOWNSTREAM WERE ALL INFECTED WITH C. SHASTA SO. THE CHANCE THEY NEVER MADE IT OUT TO THE OCEAN. THE FEATHER RIVER HATCHERY IS TOLD US THIS YEAR THAT THEY'LL PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION FISH OVER AND ABOVE NORMAL QUOTA- TO MITIGATE FOR DROUGHT WE'RE VERY THANKFUL FOR THAT. WE'D LIKE TO SUGGEST THAT BECAUSE OF THE C. SHASTA. THAT THE FEATHER RIVER HATCHERY CONSIDER PRODUCING THIS ADDITIONAL ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE MILLION EVERY YEAR GOING FORWARD. THE C. SHASTA THE FEATHER RIVER IS PROBABLY DUE TO A WATER TEMPERATURES OF LOW FLOWS WHICH IS WHAT WE'VE SEEN IN OTHER RIVERS AND THAT CAN BE DIRECTLY TRACED BACK TO OPERATION. OF LAKE ORVILLE ORVILLE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF WATER RESOURCES SO WE WOULD SUGGEST AS PART OF A FULL MITIGATION RESPONSIBILITY- THE HATCHERY CONSIDER PRODUCING THESE ADDITIONAL FISH GOING FORWARD. ALSO RIGHT NOW THE HATCHERY THERE TO FILL THE RIVERS RELEASING ABOUT A MILLION HATCHERY FISH INTO THE FEATHER RIVER ANNUALLY- THIS IS BEEN GOING ON FOR ABOUT FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS THE CODED WIRE TAG. DATA FROM THESE VICIOUS PRETTY CLEAR WE'RE LOSING A MALL. BETWEEN PREDATION AND C. SHASTA. THIS IS A- A WASTE BASICALLY. BEFORE FIVE SEVEN YEARS AGO THESE FISH FOR TRUCK TO THE BAY AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE FISHERIES BUT THEY NO LONGER DO. SO WE'D LIKE TO ASK FOR CONSIDERATION THAT THIS PRACTICE EITHER BE ELIMINATED. OR THIS ONE MILLION FISH RELEASED BE GREATLY PARED DOWN TO ABOUT TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND FISH AT THE MOST. THAT SHOULD SUPPLY THE STATISTICAL VALIDITY FOR ANY DATA- THAT IS BEING GATHERED FROM THIS PRACTICE. I WANT TO SHIFT DOWN TO SPEAK BRIEF WE HAVE- WERE FISHER. IN IT OR SAN. BAY THE TRADITIONAL AND HISTORIC RELEASE LOCATIONS AROUND VALLEJO. OVER THE LAST FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS FISHER BEEN RELEASED OUT OF SAUSALITO. ENOUGH DATA HAS NOW BEEN COLLECTED BUT WE CAN SEE CLEARLY. THAT SAUSALITO RELEASE FISH SURVIVE IT ABOUT TWICE. WHAT THE FISH RELEASED IN VALLEJO SURVIVE THAT THE DEPARTMENT IS- PRETTY GOOD ABOUT STARTING TO CONSIDER MOVING RELEASES FURTHER WEST. BUT WE WANT TO STRONGLY SUPPORT THAT. IT'S NOT CLEAR OTHER THAN THE LOGISTICS THAT VALLEJOS CLOSER AND HAS. EASY FACILITIES TO WORK IT IS NOT CLEAR WHY WE SHOULDN'T BE MOVING ALL OF OUR RELEASES FURTHER WEST. IT GIVES US BASICALLY. THE EQUIVALENT OF EE OUR HATCHERY PRODUCTION SIMPLY BY KEEPING THE TRUCKS ON THE ROAD JUST A FEW MORE MILES AND GETTING THEM OUT NEAR THE GOLDEN GATE BRIDGE- I WANT TO SWITCH AGAIN AND SPEAK REAL BRIEFLY ABOUT CODED WIRE TAGS. THESE ARE THE LITTLE BITS OF WIRE- THAT- IN PLACED INTO THE SNOUT. OF JUVENILE SALMON. THE SALMON HAVE TO BE ABOUT THREE INCHES LONG. IN ORDER FOR THE MACHINES TO DO THIS IN MASS QUANTITIES TO HANDLE THEM BUT THE PROBLEM IS WHEN YOU'RE GROWN THREE INCHES BIG ENOUGH-TO RECEIVE THAT TAG. YOU'RE BURNING UP THE CALENDAR YOU'VE GONE FROM WINTER INTO SPRING. AND IF THESE FISH RLEASED INTO THE SACRAMENTO BASIN BY APRIL YOU'VE GOT- AGRICULTURAL WATER DIVERSIONS- REDUCING THE QUALITY OF THE SACRAMENTO RIVER FOR THESE FISH TO GET OUT. AND YOU ALSO HAVE PREDATORS LIKE STRIPED BASS AND START TO SWIM UP INTO THE RIVER AND GOBBLE THESE FISH. SO THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION HAS PARTNERED THIS YEAR WITH US FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE OF THE COLEMAN NATIONALHATCHERY TO TRY A DIFFERENT APPROACH. COLEMAN HATCHERY WILL PRODUCE AN ADDITIONAL TWO MILLION FISH THIS YEAR BUT INSTEAD OF GROWING ABOUT TO THREE INCHES AND TAGGING THEM. WE'RE TAKING TISSUE SAMPLES FROM THE ADULT FISH THE PARROT FISH THAT'S A SHOT OF ME UP BUT- CALLED IN A FEW WEEKS AGO. THOSE TISSUE SAMPLES WILL BE ANALYZED FOR THEIR DNA. AND THREE YEARS FROM NOW WHEN THE OFFSPRING SWIM BACK UP TO THE SACRAMENTO RIVER AND SHE SHE WAS SAMPLED. A DNA ANALYSIS WILL BE DONE ON A MAN WILL BE ABLE TO COMPARE WHICH OF THOSE RETURNING FISH WERE BORN FROM- THE FISH BEING RELATE THAT'LL BE RELEASED THIS COMING SPRING AT ABOUT TWO INCHES OF. INSIGHTS AND ONE OF THE GREAT THINGS ABOUT RELEASING HIM AT TWO INCHES IF YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RELEASED IN PROBABLY IN EARLY TO MID FEBRUARY. WHEN THE RIVER IS STILL RELATIVELY HIGH. SO THIS IS AN EXCITING PROJECT YEAH AND IT MAY BE ONE FOR STATE HATCHERIES TO CONSIDER. REPLICATING AND I WILL STOP THEIR- THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MCMANUS WE'RE GONNA GET BACK TO YOU WITH QUESTIONS IN JUST A FEW MOMENTS WE REALLY APPRECIATE IT YEAH THAT'S ON THE BAND'S PRESS IN THE GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION WE'RE NOT GOING TO HEAR. FROM THE FISHERIES- IN THE FLEET IN HIS NAME IS GEORGE FRANCHISE PRESS IN THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION. HE'S GONNA TELL US WHAT HE'S SEEN OUT ON THE WATER- AND AGAIN JUST A REMINDER EVEN THOUGH WE MAY HAVE A GOOD SALMON SEASON THIS YEAR- THE MORE WE SEE A DAYDIE OFF. FOR THE WINTER RUN MEANS THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE IN THE YEARS AHEAD. SO MR BRANCH ON THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS FROM THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK SIR. THANK YOU THANK YU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK HERE- YOU KNOW LIKE YOU SAID I'M COMMERCIAL SALMON FISHERMEN- BASED OUT OF CRESCENT CITY CALIFORNIA BUT- I'D LIKE TO START OFF WITH A BRIEF. REPORTS IN THE WATER THIS SEASON- YOU KNOW WE SAW GREAT OCEAN CONDITIONS UP AND DOWN THE CALIFORNIA COAST. ARE CONDUCIVE TO SALMON SURVIVAL- YOU KNOW THIS SEASON STRUCTURES WERE DRASTICALLY CUT BY. UP TO FIFTY PERCENT- FROM THE HISTORICAL DATES WITH. NO ZERO OUR COMMERCIAL AND ABOUT A MONTH RECREATIONAL OPPORTUNITY ON THE CLIMATE MANAGEMENT ZONE- YOU KNOW CATCH ENDED UP BEING ABOVE. YOU KNOW WHAT THE MODELS PREDICTED- YOU KNOW HOWEVER LIKE CHUCK SAID. THOSE WERE FROM. THOSE WERE FROM THE OLD. FISH THAT WERE ABLE TO SURVIVE IN THE LAST WET CYCLE. SO YOU KNOW THAT. IN TURN IS IT GOING TO BE YOU KNOW. WHAT WILL BE IN THE OCEAN NEXT YEAR. AFTER THAT- YOU KNOW. I THANK YOU FOR. YOU KNOW A LOT OF. THE ISSUES THAT CHALK MENTIONED- YOU KNOW AFTER YOUR FORMS AND YOU KNOW IN FIRST DR UPDATES. ARE ALL FALL ON DESPERATELY NEEDED- YOU KNOW I HAVEN'T HEARD A WHOLE LOT OF TALK ON THE KLAMATH. ON YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF TALK ON CENTRAL VALLEY SHOW ALL GIVE A BRIEF KLAMATH UPDATE- THE OTHER WAS. OBVIOUSLY AGAIN A LARGE C. SHASTA FISH KILL ON YOU KNOW THIS SPRING ON THE KLAMATH SYSTEM ITSELF. WHICH ULTIMATELY LED FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER CDFW TWO TRUCKS FISH FROM IRON GATE OUTREACH TO OTHER FACILITIES TO HOLD THEM OVER- WHICH PREVENTED CERTAIN DEATH- BY THE TIME YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE. READY AND ACCLIMATED INSTALL CHAD- LIKE JOHN JUST MENTIONED YOU KNOW ENCODER WIRE TAG. THOSE FISHER STILL CURRENTLY BEING HELD IN FACILITIES- YOU KNOW TO BE RELEASED. SHORTLY WHEN THERE IS. NO BETTER RIVER CONDITIONS. EARLY REPORTS- FROM THE THIS YEAR FROM THE ANGLER- YOU KNOW ON THE RIVER. WAS THAT THERE WAS A DECENT RETURN TO FINISH ON THIS FALL. HOWEVER THOUGH YOU KNOW THE CLIMATE SYSTEM YOU KNOW IT IS STILL IN AN OVERALL VERY POOR STATE- YOU KNOW THIS CONTINUES FOR THE NEED OF WHAT DIRECTOR BONHAM MENTIONED- ARM NO. MORE WE NEED TO HAVE. THE ABILITY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH YOU KNOW IMPROVING THIS REVERSE CONDITIONS ON DAM REMOVAL- WHICH SHE SPOKE ABOUT WAS AND IS POTENTIALLY ONE OF THE BIGGEST. BENEFIT SURE NO BENEFITS SO WE COULD HAVE BY- HELPING FLUSH OUT THAT SYSTEM. AND YOU KNOW OPEN UP. ON WHAT HE REFERENCED YOU KNOW UPWARDS OF THREE HUNDRED MILES OF SPAWNING HABITAT UPSTREAM ON. NO BUT THERE'S NOT NO THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S YOU KNOW SHOULD NOT CONSIDER OUR CONCERNS ON THE KLAMATH RIVER WE HAVE LARGE CONCERNS WITH BASALT COLO ON YOUR OWN A LARGELY LIVE IN THE TRIBUTARIES OF THE KLAMATH- YOU'RE ON THERE'S OVERWHELMING CONCERNS WITH. THE CO HOST ON KUDLOW THAT ARE IN THE SCOTTISH JOHNSTON TRIBUTARIES- DUE TO YOU KNOW VERY POOR HABITAT AND THE LACK OF. OF WATER QUALITY AND LACK OF FLOW FROM YOUR- IN THIS LAST YEAR THERE WAS SOME SOME TALKING AND SOME- MINIMUM LOWER REQUIREMENTS ARE FOR THE SCOTTISH ROSTER RIVER WHICH YOU KNOW AS FAR AS I'M AWARE OF WAR MARSHALL VOLUNTARY ON YOUR GREAT STEPS FORWARD BY. I THINK THERE NEEDS TO BE MORE CONVERSATION ON POTENTIALLY MAKING THOSE MANDATORY AND SETTING CRITERIA ON WHEN. WHY AND HOW. ARE ALL ON DO WE NEED TO LOOK INTO POLICIES- YOU KNOW IN IN THE RIVER SYSTEMS OURSELVES- YOU KNOW. REVIEW WHAT IS WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING ON NEW AGREEMENTS LIKE A SAFE HARBOR AGREEMENT ON THE SHOP STOCK- THE ALL GOOD INTENTIONS BUT YOU KNOW. JUST RELOOK AT STOP AND SEE WHAT WHAT WHAT IS ACTUALLY HELPING SH MOM THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF CONVERSATION BETWEEN INDUSTRY STAKEHOLDERS- SURROUNDING THE SALMON ISSUES- WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF AND FORMING A COALITION- IN RIVER AND OCEAN STAKEHOLDERS. TO HELP- FORMER COP- HELP HOLD FORMAL CONVERSATIONS WITH STATE AND FEDERAL AGENCIES ARMONK POTENTIAL IDEAS TO. HELP OUR SALMON SPECIES. I YOU KNOW IDEA IN AND HAS BEEN TOUCHED ON BY DIRECTOR BONHAM AND BY. JOHN MCMANUS BEFORE ME- YOU KNOW WE NEED TO MAXIMIZE THE EFFICIENCY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR HATCHERY OPERATIONS- YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN AROUND TWENTY YEARS. SINCE THERE HAVE NO BEEN UPDATED AND NOT JUST IN THE INFRASTRUCTURE WORK TRUCK DIRECTOR BONG WAS TALKING ABOUT WHICH IS GREAT TO HEAR ALSO THE POLICIES ON OF THEIR OPERATIONS IN THE STRATEGIES OF RELEASE- YOU KNOW GIVEN DROUGHT CLIMATE CHANGE GLOBAL WARMING. YOUR RADIC WEATHER CONDITIONS. ON YOUR JUST MAKES SENSE TO OPEN THE BOOKS BASICALLY AND LOOK BACK INTO WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING YOU KNOW WHAT HAS WORKED IN THE PAST- AND LOOKING TO THE FUTURE. SO THAT WE COULD YOU KNOW. HOPEFULLY HI- SALMON IN THE FUTURE- THE THOROUGH. THIRTY SECONDS YES PLEASE ALL RIGHT ARM NO ONE OF THE MAIN IDEAS AND STRATEGIES THAT HAS BEEN TALKED ABOUT- YOU KNOW IS THE IDEA OF A HYBRID EDGE FRYING A SMALL RELEASE WHICH WILL. BE CENTRALLY TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF LIQUID NO JOHN DID A LITTLE PRESENTATION ON OF YOU KNOW GETTING FISH INTO THE RIVER SYSTEMS MIGHT BE NATURALLY WOULD AS IF THEY YOU KNOW SPAWNED OUT OF THE GROUND WAR. EARLY IN THE YEAR YOU KNOW LATE JANUARY FEBRUARY TIME FRAME ON WHEN RIVER CONDITIONS ARE THE BEST THING WHEN THE C. SHASTA PARASITES- YOU ARE DORMANT AND YOU KNOW TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NATURE WHEN NATURE IS THERE TO HELP US- BUT THEN ALSO USING YOU KNOW THE SMALL RELEASE STRATEGIES WHICH HAS SUSTAINED THE FISHERY SENSE AROUND TWO THOUSAND- YOU KNOW AND THE ABILITY TO TRACK. WHEN THOSE CONDITIONS ARE PRESENT AND ARE YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY I THINK COORDINATION LIKE WAS MENTIONED BETWEEN WATER D. W. R. AGENCY STAFFER RELEASES CALL FLOWS ARM DON'T MAKE SENSE. ARE STANDARDIZING THE APPROACH FOR TRUCKING THE FINISH ON YOUR WIN IN RIVER CRITERIA IS MET OR WHEN IN RIVER. CONDITIONS ARE SO POOR THAT- YOU KNOW THEY WON'T MAKE IT ON. THANK YOU MR BURCH I'M VERY GRATEFUL- THANK YOU SO MUCH I AM. TRULY APPRECIATE MY BRATCHER TO AT BOTH ON THE NORTH COAST AND THROUGH THE STATE HE'S PRESENT THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION- WELL OBVIOUSLY MISTER ROGERS MAY HANG IN WITH US TO SEE IF THERE'S ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE. IN NOW WE'VE GOT TO BE ABLE TO HEAR FROM DOUG OBG HE SENIOR ATTORNEY FOR THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL- YOU WE ALL KNOW WHEN HE'S PRESENTED IN FRONT OF THE COMMITTEE BEFORE HE'S GONNA BE PROVIDING AN UPDATE ON CALIFORNIA'S. SAME SITUATION TALK ABOUT THE WATER MANAGEMENT PROCESS AND ITS IMPACTS ON FISH. FISHERIES IN OF COURSE- THE ENVIRONMENT WATERSHEDS MISTER BIJOU WE WELCOME YOU BACK. IN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK SIR YOU HAVE THE FLOOR IN FIVE MINUTES. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT KIND INVITATION AND IT REALLY IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE AND PRESENTING IT. BUSY CREATOR FISHERIES FORUM REALLY ONE OF THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HERE FOR A HEARD FROM THE DIRECTOR TODAY CALIFORNIA SALMON ARE FACING A BLEAK FUTURE WITH MANY RUNS FACING EXTINCTION IN THE COMING YEARS IF WE DON'T CHANGE COURSE. EARNING NOT ONLY THE FISH BUT THE NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES FISHING COMMUNITIES AND ALL THOSE WHO CARE ABOUT THEIR HEALTH. BUT THAT STORY HAS NOT YET BEEN TOLD HAS NOT BEEN WRITTEN AND THAT OUTCOME IS NOT A FATE ACCOMPLI. THE FOCUS OF MY TESTIMONY TODAY WILL BE ON CHINOOK SALMON IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY BUT I WANT TO TAKE A MOMENT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEVASTATING SITUATION PASTING DATA. NATIVE AMERICAN TRIBES. AND THE SAME THEY DEPEND ON IN THE KLAMATH BASIN INCLUDING THE- CONTRAST RIVERS. MANY OF THE PROBLEMS THAT SAME INCREASE IN THOSE STREAMS. ARE THE SAME AS THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY LACK OF ADEQUATE INSTREAM FLOWS IN EXCESS OF WATER TEMPERATURES LARGELY CAUSED BY OVER ALLOCATION OF WATER RIGHTS AND UNSUSTAINABLE WATER DIVERSIONS. AND THOSE ADVERSE IMPACTS ARE ARE FAR MORE SEVERE IN DROUGHT YEARS LIKE THIS. IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE ARE FACING DEVASTATING MORTALITY THIS YEAR. YESTERDAY I RECEIVED AN UPDATE FROM THE FEDERAL NATIONAL. MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE ESTIMATING THAT. THEY NOW ESTIMATE THAT 75% OF THE HIGHLY ENDANGERED WINTER RUN CHINOOK SALMON WERE KILLED THIS YEAR SOLELY BY LEGAL WATER TEMPERATURE. AND WHEN YOU ADD IN THE ADDITIONAL MAN MADE AND NATURAL MORTALITY IT APPEARS THAT ONLY 122% OF THESE ENDANGERED BABIES DEMONSTRATE JUST THE FIRST FEW MONTHS OF THEIR LIVES. AND MIGRATE DOWN TO THE REQUEST THE REGION DAM IN THE UPPER SACRAMENTO RIVER. MEANS EVEN FEWER OF THEM WILL SURVIVE THEIR MIGRATION DOWN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER THROUGH THE DELTA THREE SAN FRANCISCO BAY. AND THEN SPENDING TWO TO THREE YEARS IN THE OCEAN BEFORE RETURNING TO SPAWN. THAT'S BECAUSE THE SCIENCE IS VERY CLEAR. THAT LOWER CLOSING THESE RIVERS MEANS FEWER FISH SURVIVING. AND IT'S NOT JUST THE ENDANGERED SALMON RUNS THIS YEAR WE'RE LIKELY TO ALSO SEE SEVERE TEMPERATURE MORTALITY OF FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON WHICH ARE THE BACKBONE OF THE STATEMENT VICTORY. AS WATER TEMPERATURES IN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER EXCEED FIFTY NINE DEGREES. DURING THE LAST ROUTE WE STOPPED CATASTROPHIC MORTALITY OF PAUL RUN WATSON 3% PAID A PRICE OR BUY ONE. SHE IT'S MASS MORTALITY IS NOT SIMPLY TE RESULT OF DROUGHT CONDITIONS WHICH ARE STILL HERE THIS YEAR. BUT IS REALLY ALSO A FUNCTION OF OUR ANTIQUATED WATER RIGHT SYSTEM AND THE LACK OF ENFORCEABLE PROTECTIONS FOR SALMON UNDER STATE FEDERAL LAW. INSTEAD OF MAINTAINING ADEQUATE WATER TEMPERATURE TRISTAN IS REQUIRED UNDER WATER RIGHTS ORDER NINETY DASH FIVE. IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THE STATE WATER BOARD ALLOW THE STATE AND FEDERAL WATER PROJECTS TO DRAIN SHASTA RESERVOIR OTHER UPSTREAM RESERVOIRS IN ORDER TO ALLOCATE MORE THAN FOUR MILLION ACRE FEET OF WATER TO THE CONTRACTORS. LEAVING SALMON WITHOUT THE COLD WATER THEY NEED TO SURVIVE. THAT MASSIVE MORTALITY WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S TWENTY NINETEEN BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. WHICH PURPORT TO ALLOW THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT TO KILL IN THREE CONSECUTIVE YEARS BEFORE THE BIOLOGICAL OPINION WOULD BE VIOLATED. THAT TRULY AND QUITE LITERALLY HAS A. PLAN FOR EXTENSION OF OUR SALMON RUNS. WHAT'S IS THAT THESE DECISIONS MEANS THAT CALIFORNIA HAVE EXTREMELY LOW WATER STORED IN OUR RESERVOIRS. TO GO INTO THIS YEAR. AND WHILE THE LATE OCTOBER STORM WAS IMPRESSIVE IT HARDLY MADE A DENT IN MOST OF OUR RESERVOIRS MOST OF WHICH ARE STILL AT NEAR RECORD LOW LEVELS. OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO IS DRY AS PREDICTED BY THE LONG RANGE WEATHER FORECAST CONDITIONS FOR SALMON ARE LIKELY TO BE EVEN WORSE THIS YEAR. BUT EXCESSIVE MORTALITY DUE TO LEGAL WATER TEMPERATURES LOOK CLOSE. DROUGHTS ARE INEVITABLE AND PERSONABLE AND SENATORS HAVE SURVIVED DROUGHTS FOR MILLENNIA. BUT THE IMPACTS OF DROUGHT OR NOW MORE SEVERE FIRST CAME IN THEY WERE NATURALLY BECAUSE OF THE EXCESSIVE. TEMPERATURES AFTER THE LAST ROUND ENDED IN TWENTY FIFTEEN TWENTY SIXTEEN THE STATE WATER BOARD ADMITTED THAT THE WAIVER OF DELTA WATER QUALITY STANDARDS TO TEMPORARY POSITIONS AND THE FAILURE TO MAINTAIN ADEQUATE TEMPERATURE WELL BELOW SHASTA DAM WAS QUOTE NOT SUSTAINABLE PROFESSIONAL WILDLIFE AND THAT CHANGES TO THE DROP PLANNING RESPONSE PROCESS ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE THE FISH AND WILDLIFE ARE NOT UNREASONABLY IMPACTED IN THE FUTURE AND TO ENSURE THAT VERY SPECIES DO NOT EXTEND AND QUOTE UNFORTUNATELY NOTHING HAPPENED THE STATE DID NOT PREPARE FOR TRIAL IN SINCE THEN AND INSTEAD OF THE STATE'S RESPONSE SEEMS TO BE THE SAME AS IT WAS A MOLE IN THE LAST ROW. PROTECTION THE STATE WATER BOARD TO LEAVE WATER QUALITY STANDARDS TO PROTECT SALMON AND OTHER SPECIES AND SIMPLY PRAY FOR RAIN. AND THAT IS NOT A PLAN. THAT SAID THERE ARE SOME OF PROGRESS YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE THAT YOU HEARD THE STATE WATER BOARD DD ADOPT EMERGENCY. REGULATIONS TO PROTECT. THE HOME IN CHINOOK SALMON IN A SCOTTISH AFTER REVERSING THE PROTECTIONIST KAMIN AND KNOWING YOUR PRE. BUT THESE MINIMUM STREAM FLOW REGULATIONS WILL DISAPPEAR WITH THE END OF THE TRIAL THEY'RE NOT PERMANENT SOLUTIONS. AND AT THE SAME TIME MANY OF THE SO CALLED PRE NINETEEN FOURTEEN WATER RIGHTS HOLDERS FOLLOWING CLAIMS THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN'T CURTAIL THEM. AND THAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO EFFECTIVELY THE WATER STREAMS TO PROPEL THEIR WATER RATES. ALSO IN GOOD NEWS AS YOU HEARD FROM THE DIRECTOR. STATE OF CALIFORNIA AND OUR COALITION OF FISHING AND CONSERVATION GROUPS ARE MOVING FORWARD IN OVERTURNING THE DROP IN MY- ADMINISTRATION'S BLATANTLY UNLAWFUL BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. HOWEVER THE STATE INVESTOR PROPOSED INTERIM OPERATIONS FOR NEXT YEAR IS THAT WHILE THEY ARE BETTER THAN THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION'S BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS. FAILED TO PROTECT SALMON AND OTHER ENDANGERED SPECIES. CALIFORNIA'S WATER SYSTEM IS IN DIRE NEED OF REFORM IN INCLUDING OUR DEEPLY INEQUITABLE WATERING SYSTEM. STAYS PROMISED FAR MORE WATER RATES N THE REGION AN AVERAGE YEAR LET ALONE IN A DROUGHT YEAR AND AT THE SAME TIME THE STATE WATER BOARDS THAT FAIL TO ESTABLISH INSTREAM FLOW REQUIREMENTS TO PROTECT SALMON IN OUR RIVERS. IN PERMITS. IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT WHEN I RIGHT AFTER RIGHT BEFORE I STARTED ENERGY SEE THE STATE WATER BOARD BEGAN THE REGULATORY PROCEEDING TO UPDATE WATER QUALITY AND MINIMUM FLOWS IN THE BATTLE TO WATERSHED. AND YET IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE THAT PROCEEDING IS STILL YEARS AWAY FROM BEING CONCLUDED. WITHOUT NEW OBJECTIVES FOR SACRAMENT ORDER INFLOW DELTA OUTFLOW AND IN DELTA FLOWS. SANDERS AND HAVE NOT UPDATED SINCE. NINETEEN NINETY FIVE. AND WE ARE PLEASED THAT ST RECENTLY ANNOUNCED IT'S FINALLY GOING TO START MOVING FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT THE UPDATED INTEREST INSTREAM FLOW REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PALMER ST STANISLAUS RIVERS THAT WERE ADOPTED BY THE WATERBOARDING TWENTY EIGHTEEN ENDING THREE YEARS OF NEGOTIATIONS OVER. EIGHT POINT FIVE BARTER AGREEMENTS THAT WOULD HAVE FAILED TO PROTECT SALMON AND THE SERVERS BUT THE STATE CONTINUES TO DELAY THE STATE WATER PORTS REGULATORY PROCESS TO UPDATE THE REST OF THE STANDARDS AND THE DATE OF THE PLAN IN PURSUIT OF SO CALLED VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. BASED ON MAGICAL THINKING ABOUT WHAT SALMON NEED. AND WHAT THE STATUS QUO'S DROP DIRE YOU STILL HAVEN'T BAYERN MENTALLY HARMFUL PROJECTS LIKE THE PROPOSED SITES RESERVOIR IN THE DELTA CONVEYANCE PROJECT THAT WOULD MAKE CONDITIONS EVEN WORSE FOR SALMON BY DIVERTING EVER MORE WATER FROM OUR TAPS IT ALL THIS IS. ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS HERE THANK YOU. AS YOU GREATER OFTEN SAID FISH NEED WATER. THOSE WHO BENEFIT FROM THE STATUS QUO ARE INEVITABLE WATER POLICY ACTIVELY TRY TO MAKE WATER POLICY MORE COMPLICATED THAN IT IS HIDING BEHIND JARGON AND ACRONYMS TO DISCOURAGE THE PUBLIC. AND DECISION MAKERS FROM ASKING TOUGH QUESTIONS. TOUGH QUESTIONS WHY SOME COMMUNITIES LAST YEAR WATER. OR EVEN ANY WATER IN THEIR TAPS. WELL STEWART RESNICK CONTROLS MORE WATER THAN CITY INTERCITY REALLY ISN'T IN A YEAR. TOUGH QUESTIONS WHILE NEW ALMOND ORCHARDS ARE BEING PLANTED IN THE DROP WITHOUT ANY SURFACE WATER SUPPLIES FOR THE TRAINING OUR WATER. CALIFORNIA'S MORE THAN TWO MILLION ACRES OF IRRIGATED ALMONDS PISTACHIOS AND WALNUTS. USE MORE WATER THAN ALL THIRTY NINE MILLION RESIDENTS OF CALIFORNIA COMBINE. TOUGH QUESTIONS LIKE WHETHER STATE DOES NOT HAVE A REAL TIME REPORTING OF WATER DIVERSIONS RELYING ON PAPER SUBMISSIONS THAT ARE SEVERAL YEARS OLD. I'M THERE I'LL- SHE WAS RIGHT AS HE WAS WITH SO MANY THINGS LIKE ALL OF US AND WE NEED WATER NOT MAGICAL THINKING. TO STAVE OFF EXTINCTION RESTORE SALMON HELP UNDERSTAND RUNS A PROTECT THE TRIBES IN FISHING JOBS IN COMMUNITIES THAT DEPEND ON THEIR HEALTH. STATE WATER BOARD NEEDS TO ESTABLISH LONG TERM MINIMUM FLOWS AND OTHER REGULATORY PROTECTIONS. ARE REVERSION FISHERIES IN THE BATTLE. THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY JUST BY THE FACT THAT CONCLUDES MY PREPARED REMARKS THANK YOU SO MUCH AND HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS I WANT TO SEE IF THEIR WAY SO. HAS ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SOONER MR B. G. MR MCMANUS I'D LIKE TO HAVE YOU LOOK IN YOUR CRYSTAL BALL AND THEN I'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT- COMING OFF OF THESE DRACONIAN INTEGRATED FEDERAL WATER POLICIES. NUMBER ONE- WHAT'S YOUR PREDICTION. AS WE MOVE FORWARD- IN TWO TWENTY TWENTY TWO FOR THAT TWENTY TWENTY TWO YEAR- IN ESPECIALLY FOR FISHERIES NUMBER ONE. IN THE NUMBER TWO IT'S GOING TO TAKE TWO THREE FOUR YEARS TO BE ABLE TO TRANSITION INTO THESE NEW FEDERAL WATER LOSS. IN THE MEANTIME. VETR WATER RULES IN THE MEANTIME I SEAMEN ARE GONNA-CONTINUE TO SUFFER. SO EVEN IN THE INTERIM STEP IN EVEN IF WE GOT RID OF THESE FOLLOWING THAT WE- THAT WE GOT RID OF THESE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS. TO MR BG ON THOSE TWO ITEMS YOUR PREDICTION AND THEN TALK TO US ABOUT THAT INTERIM PERIOD BETWEEN. WHERE WE'RE AT NOW STEPPING AWAY FROM THE VOLUNTARY AGREEMENTS IN THE WATER POLICY IN ADOPTING NEW RULES- AND THEN MR MCMANUS. THANK YOU IT'S A GREAT. AND ONE OF US CAN ACT PREDICT WHAT THE HYDRAULIC IS GOING TO BE LIKE NEXT YEAR. IT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AND AS A DIRECTOR NOTED AND AS I NOTED. WE HAVE A HUGE DEFICIT IN TERMS OF RESERVOIR STORAGE- BECAUSE WE TRAIN THE RESERVOIRS TO MEET WATER DELIVERIES THIS YEAR. AND IT MEANS THAT IF NEXT YEAR IS DRY AS PREDICTED. WE'RE LIKELY TO SEE ANOTHER TERRIBLE YEAR UNLESS WE CHANGE COURSE AND I THINK WE ARE STARTING TO SEE THAT- YOU KNOW. AS I MENTIONED THE STATE AND FEDERAL GOVERNMENTS ARE TALKING ABOUT INTERIM PROTECTIONS IN OUR FEDERAL COURT LITIGATION. WE'RE CONFIDENT THAT THOSE PROTECTIONS DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH- AND THAT'S JUST FOR THIS NEXT YEAR. YOU KNOW I THINK STEPPING BACK YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT THE ENDANGERED SPECIES ACT IS BEING INVOKED HERE BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S FAILED TO UPHOLD ITS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS TO PROTECT SALMON NOT JUST THE ENDANGERED RUNS BUT FALL RUN CHINOOK SALMON AS WELL. AND THOSE BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS IN ESA PROTECTIONS DON'T PROTECT THE BALL RUN GET SOME INS INCIDENTAL ANCILLARY BENEFITS FROM PROTECTING THE ENDANGERED GROUNDS BUT NOTHING THAT'S FOCUSED EXCLUSIVELY ON THAT AND THAT HAS TO CHANGE. YOU KNOW THAT IS THE STATE WATER BOARDS JOB THAT'S THE CALIFORNIA APARTMENT FISHING GAMES JOB TO SAY WHAT IS NECESSARY TO PROTECT ALL SALMON RUNS NOT JUST THE ENDANGERED RUNS AND I THINK YOU KNOW I AM OPTIMISTIC THAT WE'RE GOING TO SEE IMPROVE PROTECTIONS AND THEN IN THE NEAR FUTURE- THANKS TO LITIGATION BY OUR COALITION OF THE CFA ENERGY C. GOLDEN STATE SALMON ASSOCIATION AND OTHERS- AS WELL AS THE LITIGATION BY CITY CALIFORNIA. BUT WE NEED TO REDOUBLE OUR EFFORTS AND FRANKLY THE PURSUIT OF ONTARIO AGREEMENTS HAS REALLY DELAYED THE STATE BOARD'S ADOPTION OF MEANINGFUL PROTECTIONS THAT WILL LAST NOT JUST DURING THE DROUGHT BUT TO ENSURE WE HAVE ADEQUATE PLEASANT TEMPERATURES IN ALL YEARS BECAUSE AS A DIRECTOR SAID WE CAN'T JUST PROTECT THEM IN THE DROUGHTS AND LET THEM SUFFER ANY OTHER YEAR SINCE WE CAN'T LOSE THEM AND IT ROUTES AND THEN PRETEND LIKE THE OTHER YEARS YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE THEM. THANK YOU SO MUCH WBG SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH THE NATURAL DEFENSE COUNSEL. MISTER MCMANUS SUPPORTS OR SIR. THANKS SO- THE DAMAGE HAPPENING NOW- FALL RUN. TYPICALLY PEAK UNDER SPOTTING IN MID OCTOBER AND THE TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER SACRAMENTO BASIN RIGHT NOW OR IN THE FIFTY EIGHT FIFTY NINE DEGREES THEY NEED SOMETHING COLDER THAN FIFTY FIVE ANYTHING NORTH OF FIFTY FIVE WE'RE LOSING THOSE SAKE SO THE DAMAGE IS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW AND WHAT IT MEANS TO ME IS EVEN IF IT RAINS CATS AND DOGS THROUGH THE WINTER. THERE ARE GOING TO BE THAT MANY JUVENILE SALMON COMING DOWN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER NEXT SPRING BECAUSE YOU'RE SIMPLY NOT GOING TO SURVIVE- OUT OF THE GRAVEL OUR NUMBER ONE OR NUMBER TWO HAVING SAID THAT YOU KNOW WE SAW- SPRING ROAD RETURNED TO BUTTE CREEK THIS YEAR IN REALLY GOOD NUMBERS ACTUALLY- MOST OF THEM DIED PRIOR TO BEING ABLE TO SPOT BECAUSE OF HOT WATER. HOWEVER SOME SURVIVED YEAH I THINK IT WOULD BE WHO BOASTS OF THE DEPARTMENT WOULD GET WITH THE WATER RESOURCES BOARD AND PREPARE FOR CURTAILMENTS. OF DIVERSIONS ALONG BUTTE CREEK FOR NEXT SPRING GET THE SURVIVING JUVENILE SPRING RUN SAFELY DOWN AND OUT OF BUTTE CREEK AND DOWN THE SACRAMENTO RIVER TO THE OCEAN SO THAT pANOTHER POINT I WOULD JUST LIKE TO VISIT- DOUG MENTION THE TEMPORARY URGENCY CHANGE PETITIONS THESE ARE THE- THE PETITIONS. BASICALLY THAT THE WATER DIVERTERS TAKE TO THE STATE WATER BOARD GET RUBBER STAMPED WHETHER THEY NEED TO VIOLATE- WATER RULES AS FAR AS I CAN TELL THE WATER BOARD HAS BEEN APPROVING THESE THINGS WITH BASICALLY LITTLE OR NO COST TO THE WATER CONTRACTORS. WHAT WAS THE COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT EVERY TIME YOU WANT TO GET A TCP APPROVED IT'S GOING TO COST YOU SOMETHING IT SEEMS TO ME THAT MIGHT GIVE SOME PAUSE TO THE WATER CONTRACTORS TO MAKE THEM THINK THROUGH HOW OFTEN THEY WANT TO GO BACK TO THE WELL AND ASKED FOR A SPECIAL DISPENSATION. FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD TO VIOLATEWATER STANDARDS. ONE FINAL POINT IS- IN THE FISHERIES WE WILL BE LOOKING TO THE HATCHERIES TO PROVIDE. A BANDAID A BRIDGE TO KEEP. THE ON THE RECREATIONAL FISHERIES BOTH OF THE OCEAN AND INLAND- A FLOAT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS WILL BE LIVING ON HATCHERY FISH IS WHAT IT BOILS DOWN TO. SO I'LL STOP THERE. THANK YOU SO MUCH HAVE A GREAT RESPECT MENACE I WANNA BE A GO TO MR BATCHER MISTERBRAD SHOT. AS PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERATION. BUT THEN ALSO A CRESCENT CITY RESIDENT. EVEN MENTIONED- THE DAMS COMING DOWN- ONLINE- THE CLAIM IF AND HOW C. SHASTA IMPACTED. SALMON ON THE KLAMATH ISSUES DEVASTATING. LONG TERM. YOU ALSO BELIEVE THAT THIS TEAM WILL PROCESS IS GOING TO HELP OBVIOUSLY THE ENTIRE WATERSHED BUT THE SPECIES LONG TERM SURVIVAL MR BRATCHER. YEAH THE DAM REMOVAL PROJECT- YOU KNOW THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF CONVERSATION AROUND AND YOU KNOW I THINK HAS. BEEN VETTED OUT THAT YOU KNOW OBVIOUSLY REMOVING THOSE STAGNANT POOLS OF CONTAMINATED WATER AND- IN OLD HOT WATER ABOVE- YOU KNOW THE TOP END OF THIS RIVER SYSTEM WILL. WILL ULTIMATELY ALLOW THE RIVER TO BE COOLER AND YOU KNOW THE DEEP POOLS WHICH THESE FISH NEEDED. FOR SAFE HARBOR FOR GOING OUT NOT ONLY UP TO GO TO THEIR SPAWNING GROUNDS BUT IT ALSO FOR COMING DOWN AND- YOU KNOW MORE SO ON THEIR OUT MIGRATION WHEN C. FASTER THAN YOU KNOW THE RIVER CONDITIONS WARMING NOT SEE SHASTA BECOMES PREVALENT. DOWN AND YOU KNOW REMOVING- YOU KNOW THOSE DOWNS IN IN ALLOWING THAT RIVER TO FLOW AGAIN YOU KNOW. WHAT ULTIMATELY NO CLEAR OUT THOSE. CALLS IN AND ALLOW THEM TO HAVE SAFE PASSAGE. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS GEORGE BRATCHER HE IS PRESIDENT OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION BUT WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MISTER BRAD SHOT MR OBG MR MCMANUS UP FOR THEIR REPORT HERE TO THE JOINT COMMITTEE AT THE FORTY EIGHTH ANNUAL ZEKE GRADER FISHERIES FORM THEIR FOCUS TODAY'S BEEN DROUGHT CRISIS IN SALMON FISHERIES. THANK YOU SO MUCH GERMAN UP FOR YOUR WORK FOR YOUR ADVOCACY IN FOR JOINING US HERE TODAY AS ALWAYS WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE. PLAYS IN GENERAL COMMITTEE WERE NOW GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD TO THE OUTLOOK FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO DUNGENESS CRAB SEASON HE HEARD A PREVIEW BY DIRECTOR BOTTOM HERE JUST A BIT AGO THE HOPE WOULD BE TRYING TO BE ABLE TO GET THE SEASON OPEN BY THANKSGIVING BUT- BEING CANDID RIGHT- IT'S LOOKING MORE LIKE HITTING THAT. CHRISTMAS NEW YEAR HOLIDAY SEASON AND THAT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL FOR THE LONG TERM WELL BEING OF THE- THE FISHERY AND WE HAVE A FULL REPORT HERE FOR YOU ON- AND ALL STAR PANEL SWEEPING ALTAR PANELS CAN PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON THE PROSPECTS OF HER UPCOMING JUDGES CRAB SEASON AND WE'RE GOING TO KICK OFF WITH IT DR CARISSA ANDERSON SHE IS ONE OF THE BEST- SHE'S ONE OF THE BEST. WHEN IT COMES TO ALGAL BLOOMS AND WE SEEN ALGAL BLOOMS IN IMPACT THAT IT'S HAD ON THE INDUSTRY SHE'S THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEM SHE'S GOING TO PRISON IN AN UPDATE ON THE STATE OF THE SCIENCE FOR PREDICTING HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOMS IN SCALING THE PREDICTIONS TO INFORM DECISION MAKING THE MAKING AND- OUR DOCTOR. ANDERSON IS ALSO GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS YEAR. SHE BRINGING HER CHRIS BALL WE ARE WE GONNA SEE- ARE WE GOING TO SEE A LOT OF HIGH TEST BUT WHEN IT COMES TO DEMOCRACY. THAT WE HAVE THE QUESTIONS SHE HAS ALL THE ANSWERS DOCTOR ANDERSON- WE WELCOME YOU BACK TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR WORK. THAT YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES WE'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT INDIA WHERE IS THAT CRYSTAL BALL IN THE OFFICE. OKAY YEAH IT'S MY CHILDREN'S ART BEHIND ME I GUESS- THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR HAVING ME YEARS AND REQUIRE- I WILL BLAST THROUGH MY SLIDES AND GONNA SHARE THEM BECAUSE I DON'T HAVE A LOT OF TIME SO WELL I WANTED TO MAKE JOKES ABOUT. LAST TIME I SPOKE WITH DURING THE BLOB AND I WAS A BLOG BECAUSE IT IS PREGNANT AND ALL THAT KIND OF THING I'M GOING TO TRY. OKAY THE REAL QUICK I WE IN THIS ONE CAN I GET YOUR TIME YOU GOT TO TELL US ABOUT- THE KIDS. YEAH THEY'RE CUTE THIRD BOOK TWO BOYS FIVE NINE. IF YOU ARE BUSY I CANNOT IMAGINE I HAVE A SEVEN MONTH OLD AND- CENTER WAY SO HAS OLDER KIDS AND KNOW WHAT YOU'RE GOING THROUGH. GET THROUGH IT. OKAY SO THIS IS A SNAPSHOT OF WHAT I WILL WALK THROUGH TODAY IN FIV MINUTES- I'M GONNA PUT ON MY GLASSES I CAN SEE IT BETTER BUT I'M GONNA TRY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT ALL THE WORK WE'RE DOING. WHAT DOES THAT HERE NOW LOOK LIKE WHERE WE HAD IN TERMS OF TECHNOLOGY AND ALSO GIVE YOU KIND OF MY CRYSTAL BALL. ASSESSMENT SO. ONE THING I JUST REMIND EVERYBODY WE HAVE BEEN WORKING FOR YEARS ON IMPROVING LEAD TIMES FOR HAVE. JUST THROUGH PURE SAMPLING- YOU'RE PROBABLY AWARE OF THE HAPMAP DATASET. THE WEEKLY DATASET HAVE SPECIES AS WELL AS YOU KNOW THE GAS THE CONCENTRATION I REALIZE IS. DUE TO LACK OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ONES- FROM NOR CAL YOU PRETTY MUCH JUST HAVE SANTA CRUZ WHARF THAT REPORTS ON A WEEKLY BASIS. AND BUT THESE DATA ARE ALL AVAILABLE ON THE SCHOOL'S WEBSITE ON. THIS WEBSITE WE TRY TO GET OUT AS QUICKLY AS WE CAN WE HAVE A LIST SERVE. AS WELL FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO BE ON A QUICKER ALERT TIME FOR THIS. WE'RE LOOKING AT ALL KINDS OF TAX AND NOT JUST NOT YET NOT JUST TOO MUCH TO ASK WE'RE TRYING TO EXPAND THAT OUT. THAT IS ONGOING AND NOT HAS ALSO FED INTO THE C. HARM PREDICTIONS SO THIS WAS THE MODEL THAT I WORKED ON STARTING IN GRAD SCHOOL. BUT WE DID WHAT'S CALLED PASS. THROUGH THE VALLEY OF DEATH INTO OPERATIONS OVER THE LAST. MANY YEARS EVEN SINCE I SPOKE TO YOU IS NOW AN OPERATIONAL MODEL WITH NO CLOSE WATCH SO IT GOES OUT THROUGH THEIR CHANNELS ON A DAILY BASIS- SINCE THANK YOUS WE WORK IT UP PUT IT OUT. OUR PORTALS. BUT IF AS A REMINDER THAT'S GIVING YOU EIGHT NOW CAST AS WELL AS A THREE DAY FORECAST. PROBABILITY A SIGNATURE- BALLOONS OF PARTICULAR NOTE GOSSIPING OVER A CERTAIN THRESHOLD JUST HIGH TRESTLE. AND SO THEY'RE DOING A LOT OF GOSSIPING OVER ANOTHER THRESHOLD SO WE- SHOULD PROBABLY DEFINE THE THRESHOLDS BUT REGARDLESS WHAT YOU'RE SEEING. IS ANIMATION OF WHAT THAT WOULD LOOK LIKE. I WHERE YOU CAN SEE THAT NOW I WOULD CALL YOU. THIS DEMONIC. NOT I TEND TO. THE MOVE PART FOR MYSELF BECAUSE I SEEN THAT HAS THE BEST SKILL. THE BEST ACCURACY OVER THE YEARS AS I VALIDATE THIS AND SO- I JUST WANNA POINT OUT THESE MODELS HEAVILY RELY ON STUDENTS AND HIS DATA LIKE RADAR. AND THOSE ARE THE SAME DATA. TO GIVE YOU THE SURFACE CURRENTS THAT YOU MIGHT CONSULT YOUR OUT. ON ON THE WATER BUT THEY ALSO GO INTO ARTS YOU WANT SOME TRACTOR. EARLIER ABOUT THAT YOU SHOULD NOT HEAR THEY ALSO GO INTO WILL STILL TRACK IT JUST WANT TO POINT THAT OUT. TRADITIONAL DATA. ON THE CELLULAR DNA THERE'S A CRYSTAL BALL PARK- AND THIS IS THE PART WHERE I REALLY HOPE THE MODEL HAS ZERO SKILL. BECAUSE IT HAS BEEN SHOWING THAT THE NORTH COAST FROM ABOUT SEPTEMBER TO OCTOBER WHEN I LOOK SPECIFICALLY AT CELLULAR. CASTED IT SHOWS. HOT SPOT HOT SPOT HOT SPOT ONLY FOR THE NORTH COAST MEANING KIND OF MINUTES YOU KNOW COUNTY AND WORKS ON- AND I. I HOPE THAT THAT'S NOT TRUE AND I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT MEANS ABSOLUTELY YES. BUT IT IS. NOT A GOOD SIGN. GIVEN THAT WE KNOW THAT THE DEMO GASES THAT IS ON THE SURFACE WATERS DOES MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE VENT THOSE. TRAPS. IF IT'S THERE FOR A LONG. TIME ON THIS IS IT LOOKS LIKE IF YOU GO THERE. CLOSE WATCH. ON THEIR- THAT. WHAT YOU SEE THIS IS THE KEY. OF DEAL OUTPUT YOU WOULD GET. ON WITH THE WARMER COLORS. HIGHER RISKS. OKAY SO THE NEXT THING WE'RE DOING- I'VE BEEN PUTTING THIS OUT THROUGH SCREWS FOR A LITTLE WHILE NOW I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS ABOUT IT. YOU WANT TO GET ON THE LIST SERVICES PRETTY NICE THING IT'S NOT A FORWARD LOOKING THING PRINCIPLES AND IT GIVES YOU A RETROSPECTIVE. WHAT DID THE C. HER MODEL SAY LAST MONTH- WHAT DID. WHAT HAPPENED REVEALS YOU'RE GETTING DATA. EVERY MARINE MAMMAL STRANDING CENTER. BUT IN TERMS OF FISHERIES WE GET. AS MUCH DATA AS WE CAN FROM C. PH AND WE HOT MEXICAN. FISHERIES DATA. BUT IT GIVES YOU A SENSE OF WHAT. THEIR SAMPLING LOOKS LIKE AND THE HOPE IS THAT WELL THERE'S NOT A LOT OF. FISH SPECIES IN HERE EXCEPT FOR THE BEAT WE WILL INSTALL THE ADVISORIES FOR THE STATE. WHAT IT DOES DO IS HELP OU CALIBRATE WHAT THIS MODEL LOOKS LIKE RELATIVES ANYTHING YOU'RE INTERESTED IN THE SPATIAL- REGION YOU'RE INTERESTED IN TIME SKILLS. AND HELP YOU FIGURE OUT WHETHER THIS MODEL IS. WORKING FOR YOU OR NOT DOES IT REFLECT THE REALITY THAT YOU SEE ON THE GROUND OR DOES IT- SO THIS IS A PRETTY COOL TOOL- WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO TO. FULL INSTRUMENTS FUNDED BY. SECTION COUNCIL WE'RE GETTING THESE ROBOTIC. MICROSCOPES COMMITTING SUICIDE ABOUT. EVERY PEER IN THE STATE INCLUDING TRINIDAD HERE SOON- BUT A GUY HAS AN INTAKE. AT THEIR MARINE LAB THAT WILL BE USING. BUT THESE TELL YOU IN REAL TIME EVERY THIRTY MINUTES. USING MACHINE LEARNING KIND OF FACIAL RECOGNITION ALGORITHMS FOR THE CLINTON. WHAT'S THERE NOT TOXINS BUT IT TELLS YOU. WHAT IS THERE EVERY THIRTY MINUTES SO YOU KNOW IF SOMETHING IS RAMPING UP OR RAMPING DOWN- AND IT WILL BE CO LOCATED WITH ALL KINDS OF OTHER SENSORS TO TELL US WHETHER. OCEAN ACIDIFICATION IS ALSO PLAYING A ROLE AND I'M- THE INCREASE OR DECREASE OF CERTAIN SPECIES. WE'RE HOPING THIS IS GONNA BE REVOLUTIONARY FOR THE MODELING THE MODELING WE'RE PUSHING FORWARD IN A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS ONE IS THE KIND OF MECHANISTIC FIRST PRINCIPLES HOW WIDE IS DOING OKAY AWESOME. PRODUCTION HAPPEN WHAT TURNS IT ON. TRYING TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN THROUGH MODELS USING THREE DIMENSIONAL MODELS BUT THEN ALSO SOMETHING THAT I STARTED WORKING ON IN SANTA CRUZ WE'RE NOW DOING THIS WITH THE UCLA TEAM BUT TRYING TO GET. THAT FIRST PRINCIPLE UNDERSTANDING OF HOW NUTRIENTS OR STOMACH ACID PRODUCTION INTO THESE MODELS. WE MORE REALISTIC PREDICTIONS NOT OUT PRIME TIME YET BUT WE'RE GETTING CLOSER AND CLOSER. WE CAN ALSO THINK AROUND WITH THE INTERACTIONS WITH OCEAN ACIDIFICATION HYPOXIA AND MODELS LIKE THIS WHICH IS WHAT MAKES THIS KIND OF MODEL PARTICULARLY COOL. SH THE OTHER THING WE'RE DOING THIS ACTUALLY WILL BE PROBABLY THE COOLEST OF ALL OF THIS WHEN IT COMES TO IMPROVING THE MODELS WHICH IS. NOW THAT- A GROUP HERE STRIPS. DISCOVER THE GENETIC BASIS FOR DINNER GAS PRODUCTION WE CAN TAKE A LOT ALL OF OUR INSTRUMENTATION AND GO OUT INTO THE FIELD AND ACTUALLY LOOK. WHEN THIS NEW TRAIN GOES UP DOES THAT GENE TURN ON- AND THEN THAT WILL GIVE US THE SKILL WE NEED MOVING FORWARD WE CAN CONTINUE TO DO THOSE MEASUREMENTS. AND PARAMETRIZED MODELS BETTER THAN WE CAN REALLY SAY ON THESE ARE THE CONDITIONS THAT TURN THIS ON IS THAT TELLS WHAT HAPPENS TO THE ANIMALS. IT ALSO HAPPENS TO CRAB NO AND THAT'S THE PART WHERE I THINK THAT'S OUR ACHILLES HEEL. WE HAVE A GROUP OF PEOPLE WHO'VE BEEN TRYING TO TACKLE THIS USING AGAIN MACHINE LEARNING. AND THE APPROACH HERE HAS BEEN REALLY PRACTICAL TAKE THE C. HARM OUTPUT IT SAYS THIS. IS THE RISK FOR DEMOCRATS IN THE WATER. I THEN TAKE ALL OF THE- WE HAVE FOR TOMORROW. ROUTES AND ALL THESE OTHER. SPECIES ON ROCK CLUB. STREET IS YOUR CLAIMS YOU NAME IT. AND TRY TO CONSTRAIN STATISTICALLY HOW DO YOU GET FROM THOSE IN WATER CONCENTRATIONS OR RISK ASSESSMENTS. TO THE RISK FOR THE ANIMALS- I KNEW THESE PLOTS ARE TINY THEY'RE HARD TO READ BUT ON THE RIGHT WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS. IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN WE DO THAT AND WHAT DOES IT LOOK LIKE FOR DUNGENESS CRAB ANOTHER SPECIES. THROUGH SPACE AND TIME WE HAVEN'T PUBLISHED THIS YET. IT'S NOT OPERATIONAL MODEL YET. BUT IT LOOKS PRETTY GOOD AND I THINK THIS IS THE NEXT THING ON THE HORIZON FOR US TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE- HOW DO WE MOVE TOWARDS. WHAT WE CARE ABOUT WHICH IS THE FISHERY SPECIES. THIRTY SECONDS. I'M PRETTY MUCH DONE I THINK SO I JUST WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT. ALL OF THESE TOGETHER ARE IN OUR TOOLBOX NONE OF NONE OF THESE THINGS ALONE IS GOING TO GIVE US THE ANSWERS THAT WE NEED BUT I THINK. WE WANT TO REALLY GOOD CRYSTAL BALL WE HAVE TO TACKLE THIS. FROM ALL DIFFERENT ANGLES SO THAT'S IT AND THESE ARE ALL OUR FUNDING SOURCES AND I REALLY APPRECIATE YOU HAVING HERE. STOP SHARING MY SCREEN. THANK YOU SO YOU'RE ALWAYS PLEASURE ARE GRATEFUL I GOT TRAINS INSTEAD HANG IN WITH US HERE AND TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM COMMITTEE- BUT BEFORE WE GET INTO QUESTIONS OF COMMENTS WE WANNA HEAR FROM OUR OTHER PANELISTS. OUR NEXT PANELIST IS BEEN CLAD HE'S PRESIDENT. OF THE CALIFORNIA COAST CRAB ASSOCIATION WE'RE GRATEFUL TO PARTNER. WITH MR PLATT ON SO MANY ISSUES AS WE MOVE FORWARD. HE IS WORKING THE ASSOCIATION IS WORKING TO ASSIST THE COVER DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WILDLIFE IN. THE INDUSTRY TO FIND SOLUTIONS TO SEVERAL. READ ON SEVERAL REGULATORY FRONTS THAT WILL. HELP PROTECT. ENDANGERED SPECIES SUCH AS TURTLES AND WHALES- AND ENSURE THE LONG TERM VIABILITY AND THE CRAB FISHERY. THAT HE'S GOING TO BE SPEAKING TO US ABOUT HIS OUTLOOK FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. TWENTY TWENTY TWO DUNGENESS CRAB SEASON. MISTER PRESIDENT WELCOME TO COMMITTEE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US. I GUESS SOME GOOD NEWS IT IS LOOKING LIKE I'M GONNA KNOCK ON WOOD MISTER PRESIDENT INDIA YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG. HOPEFULLY SOME GOOD NEWS ON PRICE- AND- BECAUSE WERE DEPLETED IN STOCK- BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE WHALES- IN THE BAY AREA AT CINEMA COUNTY AREA. THAT'S DOING. A BIT OF A DELAY BUT TO PLANT THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THANK YOU SENATOR MEMBERS OF THE JOINT COMMITTEE AND I'M PRESENTING THESE COMMENTS ON BEHALF OF THE NINE MEMBER BOARD OF. THE CALIFORNIA COAST CRAB ASSOCIATION. AND OUR MEMBERSHIP WHICH IS COMPRISED SOLELY OF CRAPOUT OWNERS CAPTAINS AND CRAP OURS FROM ALGAL- TO CRESCENT CITY. WELL COMMUNICATION SINCE THIS TIME LAST YEAR BETWEEN GFW CENTER REQUIREMENT CRAB FISHING STREE HAS IMPROVED. THE TROUBLE SHOOTING CONTINUES TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT MAJOR LOSSES OF TIME AN AREA FROM THE NEW RAMP REGULATIONS. SINCE THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND CENTER FOR BIOLOGICAL DIVERSITY VERSUS BONHAM THE ALL THE CRAB SEASON HAS ALL BUT DISAPPEARED. AND THE SPRING EARLY SUMMER SEASON HAS CLOSE ON AVERAGE TWO TO THREE MONTHS EARLY EARLIER THAN TRADITIONAL. THE CRAB FISHING INDUSTRY IS EXPERIENCING SIGNIFICANT HARDSHIP. IN PART DUE TO THESE CLOSURES. RAYMOND DIED SEPT SIGNIFICANTLY IN THREE YEARS AND THERE'S NOW A SERIOUS SHORTAGE OF CREW AVAILABLE TO WORK ON CRAB **** OR FOR SHORE SIDE PROCESSING AND DISTRIBUTION. COUPLED WITH SEVERAL HISTORICALLY LOW BINDING SEASONS HIGH FUEL PRICES AND OTHER FACTORS UNRELATED TO THE WALES IS TOUGH TIMES FOR OUR FISHERY. MY QUESTION TODAY IS HOW CAN CDFW THE JOINT COMMITTEE OF THE FISHING INDUSTRY ADDRESS THESE ISSUES BEFORE MORE FAMILIES LOSE BUSINESSES MANY WHICH HAVE BUILD. I HAVE A FEW IDEAS. ONE WITH A ROBUST AND GROWING POPULATION WHALES FEEDING IN MIGRATING UP FOR COACH IT IS HARD TO SEE HOW THE RARE INTERACTION WITH COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS CRAB HERE WHICH CONTINUE TO WARRANT THE MAJOR CUTBACKS BY CDFW OF TIME AN AREA IN THE FISHERY SHE DIDN'T W. CLAIMS TO HAVE BUILT FLEXIBILITY INTO THE RAFFLES IF SO THEY SHOULD BE DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PUT THE TIME IN THE AREA BACK INTO THE FISHERY. ON THE ONE HAND THE NATURAL MEAT THE NATIONAL MARINE FISHERIES SERVICE HAS ALREADY GIVEN CDFW PERMISSION TO RAISE THE LEVEL HUMPBACK INTERACTIONS IN THE VICTORY BASED ON A REVISED POPULATION REPORT THAT PUTS THE NUMBERS AROUND THREE TIMES HIGHER THAN IT WAS ESTIMATED WHEN THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WAS MADE BETWEEN G. D. AND C. F. W. HIGHER TRADERS FOR MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND SOFTER MORE TARGETED ACTIONS AND STATEWIDE CLOSURES ARE NOT ONLY ALLOWED IN RAP. WHICH SHOULD BE USED IF SHE EVER TRULY WANTS TO HELP MAINTAIN A BIBLE CRAB FISHING INDUSTRY PRESSURES CAN BE TARGETED AND ONLY THE FISHING ZONES WERE ELEVATED RISK HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AND COULD BE A DEATH RESTRICTION INSTEAD OF A CLOSURE. OR SIMPLE FLEET ADVISORY. TRIPLE C. A. IS ALL WORKING ON AN ALL. DO YOUR TEST PURPOSE FOR LAW LINING. WHICH COULD WERE VERTICAL LINES AND LOT OF FISH AT TIMES OF YEAR AND SO ON. YES WHERE WHERE ELSE MAY NOT WORK WHERE WHALES MAY BE PRESENT. ANOTHER WAY TO GET THAT WE CAN HELP KEEP THE FISHERY OPEN IS BY FINDING FUNDING AND STAFF TO HELP CONTINUE AND EXPAND TRIPLE C. H. BASSIL BASED SERVICE. THE PILOT PROJECTS CONDUCTED IN THE NORTH AND SOUTH FISHING ZONES LAST SEASON. THROUGH OUR OWN VESSELS CAN PROVIDE TIMELY REPORTS ON WELL DISTRIBUTION WHEN CDFW CANNOT GET PLANES IN THE AIR. WE REQUEST THE JOINT COMMITTEE HELP SECURE FUNDING FOR AN ONGOING SURVEY PROJECT. THREE CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL CRAB FISHERY SHOULD NOT CONTINUE TO BE CHARGED UNFAIRLY FOR EVERY CONFIRMED ENTANGLEMENT WITH AN UNIDENTIFIABLE YOUR CHILD. WHILE NEWLY MANDATED BY THE MARKETS FOR THE FIX YOUR pDIRECTION SIMPLE LINE MARKING FOR FISHERY WOULD B THE MOST EFFECTIVE AND PRACTICAL WAY PRACTICAL WAY TO IDENTIFY GEAR. THE JOINT COMMITTEE SHOULD ASK YES W. AND THE DEJECTED PRIORITIZED MANDATED LIVE MARCHING. THE TROUBLE SHE WAS GLAD TO SEE THAT BOTH THE COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL SECTORS OF OUR FISHERY STEPPED UP LAST SPRING DO YOU FEED EIGHTY FIVE THIRTY FOUR WHICH WOULD HAVE REQUIRED USE OF POP UP ROPELESS GEAR. THE CRAB FISHERIES UNIFORMED POSES DANGER IS RIDICULOUSLY EXPENSIVE AND IMPRACTICAL YOUR PROTOTYPE IF EVER IMPLEMENTED IN THE FISHERY IT WOULD CREATE FAR WORSE IN TANGO ARREST YOU'RE OPERATING. LOSS MUCH HIGHER THAN. GEAR RESULTING IN SERIOUS OCEAN POLLUTION THAT IS SUBMERGED FAR WEST COAST YOU'RE-IN OUR PRISTINE NEAR SHORE ECOSYSTEMS. THE TROUBLE SHE HAS SENT A LETTER TO CDFW REQUESTING REQUEST YOU'RE NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE DRAFT INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT APPLICATION TO NETWORKS WHICH WILL BE RELEASED THIS MONTH. WE ALSO REQUEST THE JOINT COMMITTEE HEALTH PRACTITIONERS TREE OPPOSE ANY FUTURE ATTEMPTS TO PASS A ROBUST MANDATE AT THE STATE LEGISLATURE. IT IS CLEAR TO US AND. SHOULD BE BY OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS. A ROBUST MANDATE ROOM OUR SAFE INSISTING FISH WHILE. ENTANGLEMENT REX TO MARINE MAMMALS. SPEAKING OF PRISTINE COASTAL WATERS THE WIND ENERGY PRODUCTS BEING AGGRESSIVELY PROMOTED BY THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU CAN MORE BAY COULD INTRODUCE SERIOUS DANGER TO BOTH FEEDING AND MIGRATING WHALES AND FOR THE FISHING FLEET WE REQUEST THE STATE CONDUCT DETAILED ASSESSMENT OF THE POTENTIAL THREAT TO MARINE LIFE. DIMENSIONAL SAFETY AND ALSO ASSESS THE LIKELY ECONOMIC IMPACTS TO THE EFFECTIVE FISHERIES AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES. THE CCC A WILL CONTINUE TO REMIND THE STATE THAT WILL DIGENIS CROWDS ARE MOST WIDELY SHARED AN ECONOMICALLY IMPORTANT VICTORY IT IS IN A SERIOUS JEOPARDY NOW. WE MUST FIND WAYS TO RETURN SIGNIFICANT TIME AREA TO OUR SEASONS IF WE ARE TO SURVIVE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A PIPE BREAK GRATEFUL A PRESENT IN THE CALIFORNIA COAST CAMPUS INITIATION SUPPLY IT'S GOING TO HANG OUT WITH US TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL YOU'RE HERE TODAY. THAT WE'RE NOW GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO MIKE CONROY MICRON RAISED THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. OF THE PACIFIC COAST- FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION VERY EASY FOR ME TO SAY MR CONROY. UNFORTUNATELY MR CONROY IS ALSO A DODGERS FAN BUT WE'LL FORGIVE HIM FOR THAT- IN HE'S CAN PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW. OF THE ASSOCIATION'S PERSPECTIVE ON CONCERNS FOR THE CRAB FLEET. AS WELL AS WITH RIGHT WHALE ENTANGLEMENTS. MR CONVERT WE WELCOME YOU HERE TODAY IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU THE FLOOR IS YOURS YET YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES ON THE THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. THANKS ISN'T SURE YOU CAN HEAR ME YOU'RE COMING IN LOUD AND CLEAR SIR. FIVE PERFECT THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND THANK YOU FOR THE NON BEING A DODGER FAN. YOU SAVE ME THE TROUBLE OF BRINGING IT UP. AGAIN GOOD TIMES. GOOD AFTERNOON SHERMAN WIRE FELLOW COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MIKE CONROY THEN THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION FOR SOME BUSINESSES. CREATIONS I AM ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB FISHING GEAR WORKING GROUP. AT THE OUTSET I WANT TO THANK YOU CENTER REQUIRED FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP YES THE EIGHTY SIGNED INTO LAW MANY OF THE PROVISIONS WILL DIRECTLY BENEFIT THE STATE'S COMMERCIAL. DUNGENESS CRAB HARVESTERS AND PROCESSORS THAT DURING YOUR CONVERSATION WITH DIRECTOR BOTTOM YOU MENTIONED PRICE I CAN REPORT THAT THE DYNAMICS OF THE FISHERY IN THE MARKET FOR THE FISHERY THIS YEAR ARE VASTLY DIFFERENT. THAN THE FLEET IS EXPECTING A MUCH HIGHER PRICE FOR THE HOLIDAY MARKET SHOULD THE FLEET BE ALLOWED TO UNTIE. AS YOU KNOW MISTER CHAIR THE WORKING GROUP WAS ESTABLISHED IN SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN AND IT DOESN'T ADVISORY BODY TO THE CDFW. ALONG WITH OTHER STATE AND FEDERAL PARTNERS TO ADDRESS THE RISK OF ACTIONABLE SPEECH IN ACTUAL SPECIES ENTANGLEMENTS IN CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB FISHING YEAR. ACTUAL SPECIES BEING DEFINED AS HUMPBACK AND BLUE WHALES AND OTHER BACKS YOU TROUBLES. I WOULD BE REMISS IF I DIDN'T OFFER CALLED MR DEPARTMENT IN TERMS OF THEIR ENGAGEMENT WITH THE COMMERCIAL FISHING INDUSTRY. THE REGULATIONS IMPLEMENTING THE RISK ASSESSMENT MITIGATION PROGRAM HAVE CAUSED GREAT CONFUSION AMONGST INDUSTRY IN THE DFW HAS MADE THEMSELVES AVAILABLE. TO EXPLAIN BOTH THE REGULATIONS AND THE NUANCES OF RAM TO INDUSTRY I SPECIFICALLY WANT TO CALL OUT DIRECT BONHAM CRAIG SHUMAN SAKE MASTER. RYAN BARKLEY. JOINT AGREEABLE CHRISTIE YOU HOUSE AND OTHERS FOR THEIR TIME AND PATIENCE. I ALSO WANT TO APPLAUD THE PARTICIPANTS IN THE FISHERY FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO THE PROCESS AND UTILIZING BEST PRACTICES. WHICH IS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT ONLY ONE HUMPBACK WHALES CONFIRMED TO HAVE BEEN ENTANGLED IN CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS CRAB GEAR. IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO YEARS IN EACH OF THOSE RELEASED SUCCESSFULLY. I WILL REMIND YOU THAT ONLY FIVE YEARS AGO THAT NUMBER WAS REPORTED AS TWENTY TWO. I WOULD ASK THE LEGISLATURE ACKNOWLEDGE SUCCESSES OF THE FISHERY PARTICIPANTS. IN REDUCING SUCH INTERACTIONS. IS B. O. DISPUTE THAT IT. KEY DRIVER OF THE STATE'S CHIEF ECONOMY. THE COMMERCIAL BIG CRAB FISHERY WILL FOREVER BE CHANGED. AS YOU'VE HEARD FROM MR PLATT THERE'S SERIOUS CONCERNS ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS FISHERY AND TURN THE FISHING COMMUNITIES DEPENDED UPON DUNGEON THIS CRAP. MY TIME ON THE WORKING GROUP HAS BEEN RELATIVELY SHORT I BEGAN PARTICIPATING AT THE TAIL END OF THE TWENTY TWENTY SEASON. HOWEVER DURING THAT TIME IT IS CLEAR THAT FURTHER REFINEMENT OF THE RAMP AND ITS- PROCESSES ARE NECESSARY. PERSONALLY I QUESTION WHETHER THE CURRENT PROCESS JUST TRAINABLE. BOTH IN TERMS OF THE UTILITY OF THE WORKING GROUP AS IS EVIDENCED BY THE NUMBER OF VACANCIES. AND CONFIDENCE IN THE PROGRAM UNDER UTILIZATION OF TOOLS IN THE TOOLBOX IS A COMMON COMPLAINT. I AM ENCOURAGED THAT RAMP TO POINT OUT WILL BE A REALITY MY HOPE IS THAT COMES TO FRUITION SOONER THAN LATER. CFA REMAINS COMMITTED TO PARTICIPATING IN AN EFFORT TO MAXIMIZE OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL OF THE STATE'S CRAP OUR RESEARCHERS. I WANT TO REITERATE THE QUEST THAT YOU ARE REQUESTED YOU HEARD FROM BEN REGARDING SECURING FUNDING FOR VESSEL BASED SERVICE. WHICH PROVIDED USEFUL DATA MARINE CONCENTRATIONS LAST YEAR. THOSE SURVEYS PERFORMED BY PARTICIPANTS IN THE TROUT FISHERY AUGMENTED APARTMENTS AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES AND WERE INSTRUMENTAL IN PROVIDING NUMBERS IMPLICATIONS OF ACTUAL C. SPECIES TO HELP INFORM RAMP AND THE WORKING GROUP'S DELIBERATIONS. INFORM MAKING PROCESSES REQUIRED CORRECT AND COMPLETE DATA. AND ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO SUPPORT DATA COLLECTION EFFORTS SHOULD BE PRIORITIZED. I DO WANT TO SPEND A LITTLE BIT OF TIME TALKING ABOUT SORT BOXES AND TABLES. IF YOU'VE EVER WATCHED DEADLIEST CATCH YOU'LL SEE THE CREW MEMBERS DON'T CONTENTS OF A CRAB POT ONTO A TABLE REALLY THEN PICK OUT CROWDS WHICH ARE ILLEGAL TO POSSESS FEMALES ARE UNDERSIZED CRABS AND RETURN THEM TO THE WATER. MOST OF ON OFF CALIFORNIA TRAVELERS UTILIZE A SWORD BOX FOR THE SAME PURPOSE FISHING GAME CODE SECTION EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY TWO EIGHTY TWO SEVENTY EIGHT. READS IN PART EXCEPT AS OTHERWISE PROVIDED NO DUNGENESS CRAB LESS THAN SIX AND A QUARTER INCHES IN LENGTH AND NO FEMALE DUNGENESS CRAB MAY BE TAKEN OR POSSESSED. UNDER THE LETTER OF THE LAW THE CRAPPER COULD BE CITED FOR MERELY HAVING AN UNDERSIZED FOR FEMALE CRASHING HIS ARE TRAPPED INTO BEING FOUND SUCH CRAP. IN HIS OR HER SOARING BOX. BEEN INFORMED A LONG FORCE ACTION IN WHICH A TRAVERSE IS BEING CHARGED WITH VIOLATING THAT CODE SECTION BECAUSE UNDERSIZED CRABS WERE ON THE SHORT BOX. THIS IS CAUSING CONCERN IN THE INDUSTRY GIVEN THE WIDESPREAD USE OF SORT BOXES IN THE FISHERY. I WOULD ABSOLUTELY JUST LET YOUR WORK WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP APPROPRIATE LANGUAGE WHICH WOULD PROVIDE CERTAINTY TO HARVESTERS THAT UTILIZING SHORT SORT BOXES HI HE TEMPORARILY PROCESSING OTHERWISE ILLEGAL TRAPS. WILL NOT LEAD TO ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. MR PLUS ALSO HIGHLIGHTED THE CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE TREATMENT OF IN CHAINS I DON'T FIND YOUR TYPES. HAS BEEN NOTED ONE POSSIBLE WAY TO REDUCE COSTS IS SUCH ATTAINMENTS. WOULD BE TO DEVELOP TOOLS THAT ALLOW FOR EASIER IDENTIFICATION OF WHICH FISHERY. AND ENTANGLEMENT SHOULD BE ATTRIBUTED TO. WHY PROBLEM IS THAT NTANGLEMENTS DON'T ALWAYS HAVE BLUES WHICH CAN BE USEFUL IN IDENTIFYING THE CULPRIT. OTHER STATES ARE CONSIDERING LINE MARKING AND THAT MAY BE SOMETHING THAT COULD BE USEFUL IN CALIFORNIA. THIRTY OBVIOUSLY THAT WOULD REQUIRE ME TO PARTICIPANTS IN THE OTHER STATES TRAP FISHERIES BUT IT MAY BE TIME TO START THOSE CONVERSATIONS THANKS. I THANK YOU SO MUCH THAT'S MY CON RIGHT BERRY GRATEFUL EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION MIKE'S GONNA BE HANGING WITH US AS WELL WE'RE GONNA BE OPENING T UP. FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS AND JUST A BIT BEFORE WE DO WE'RE GONNA INVITE. JANE HUMBERSTONE WITH IT SHE'S THE FISHERIES PROJECT DIRECTOR WITH THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. MYTH NUMBER SEWN SHE'S GONNA OUTLINED HOW THE NATURE CONSERVANCY'S PARTNERED WITH FISHERMEN AND MANAGERS TO. DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO REDUCE INTEGUMENT WRIST THE WHALES WE JUST HEARD THERE'S BEEN A MASSIVE REDUCTION- IN REGARDS TO A FEW TO SEVERAL DOZEN A YEAR. TO ONE LAST YEAR- IN ITS B. IS BECAUSE OF THE LEADERSHIP. OF THE FLEET IT'S BECAUSE THE LEADERSHIP. OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY IN SO MANY INVOLVED- THAT WE'RE HERE TODAY. BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT WHAT SHE'S BEEN FOCUSING ON HOW TO BE A REDUCED. ENTANGLEMENT RISKS INCLUDING THE WORKING GROUP RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PROGRAM. AND OF COURSE THE INDUSTRY LED PRESEASON SURVEY WHICH WILL GET INTO MORE JUST A BIT. TERMS DON'T WELCOME THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING US AT THE FORTIETH ANNUAL SEE GREATER FISHERIES FORM THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH AND I REQUIRE THEY COMMITTEE MANNERS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN TODAY'S PANEL- AS YOU NOTED THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WORKS WITH. GERMAN RESEARCHERS OF MYSTERY MANAGERS IN CALIFORNIA AND AROUND THE WORLD TO INCREASE THE RESILIENCE OF OCEAN ECOSYSTEMS AND COASTAL ECONOMIES TO SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES MANAGEMENT. AND TO ACHIEVE THESE GOALS IN A CHANGING CLIMATE. MEASURES NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO CHANGING OCEAN CONDITIONS FASTER MORE EFFECTIVELY. IN RECENT YEARS THE CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY HAS EXPERIENCED VERY SERIOUS ECOLOGICAL ECONOMIC IMPACTS FROM CLIMATE CHANGE RELATED ENVIRONMENTAL DESTRUCTION. THIS INCLUDES A SUDDEN INCREASE IN WAYLAND SENTIMENTS. AND THESE CHALLENGES OF THIS FISHERY AT THE FOREFRONT OF CALIFORNIA'S EFFORTS SIMPLY INCREASES CLIMATE READINESS ADAPTIVE DATA DRIVEN MANAGEMENT. AND SINCE HE'S BEEN WORKING AS PART OF THE DUNGEON IS STRUCK THIS YEAR WORKING GROUPS ON A RANGE OF APPROACHES TO REDUCING CANNOT REST WHILE SUPPORTING A THRIVING FISHERY. AND MANY OF THESE ARE NON REGULATIONS INCLUDING IMPROVED GEAR MARKING TO FIGURATION OFFICIAL AND LET US RECOVERY PROGRAM IN A FIRST OF ITS KIND RISK ASSESSMENT AND MITIGATION PROGRAM. THAT SEEKS TO PROACTIVELY RESPOND TO AN EMAIL ADDRESS. AND IT'S REALLY THANKS TO THE DEDICATION OF THE STANDARD IS PROBABLY AND THE LEADERSHIP AND SUPPORT FROM THE OPC. LEGISLATURE AND CDFW. AND WE ARE HERE DEVELOPING MANAGEMENT MEASURES AND WE'RE SEEING THAT THEY'RE CONTRIBUTING TO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR MALES AS YOU SAID SENATE REQUIRE WELL INSTRUMENTS IN CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL DUNGENESS CRAB HERE IN RECENT YEARS HAVE. ON IT AND- SOME OF THE STATE PURSUES AN INCIDENTAL TAKE PERMIT. ONGOING EFFECTIVENESS OF THESE MEASURES WILL BE CRITICAL. HOWEVER AS YOU'VE ALSO HEARD MANY OF THESE MEASURES ARE TYING DATA AND RESOURCE INTENSIVE ESPECIALLY THE ROUTE WHICH REQUIRES FREQUENT COMPREHENSIVE DATA ON RAIL SEA TURTLE AND FISHING ACTIVITY ACROSS THE GROUND. I WENT TO A DIFFERENT AREAS MISSING OR INCOMPLETE COVERAGE IT FORCES DECISIONS THAT MAY BE OVERLY RESCUE NO RAILS ARE UNNECESSARILY CONSTRAINED OPPORTUNITY. AND THESE DATA GAPS MAKE IT HARDER FOR US TO LEARN FROM THE PAST AND IMPROVE DECISION MAKING IN THE FUTURE. FINALLY UNCERTAINTY AND RISK ASSESSMENT AND DECISION MAKING TIME LINES THANK THE CHALLENGING TO COLLECT CONSISTENT DATA AND CHALLENGING FOR FISHING INDUSTRY BUSINESSES TO PLAN. SO IN SHORT WE SEE THAT DATA IS THE ENGINE OF THIS AMBITIOUS ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM AND WE NEED TO MAKE INVESTMENTS NECESSARY FOR THIS ENGINE TO RUN EFFICIENTLY AND RELIABLY AS A CORNERSTONE OF THE HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN. SO I'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT YOUR PRIORITIES TODAY TO GET US THERE. ONE IS THAT WE NEED TO LEVERAGE TECHNOLOGY FOR BETTER FASTER DATA ON FISHING EFFORT. CDFW IS COMMITTED TO FLEET WIDE MONITORING YEAH. TO HELP KEEP OUT ON THE WATER IN THE PRESENCE OF WALES WITH MANAGEMENT TOOLS SUCH AS STOCKS RESTRICTIONS WHICH MIKE AND I HAVE SPOKEN TO. HOWEVER FOR EM DIFFICULT SCHOOLS THE PROGRAM MUST BE DESIGNED TO DELIVER THE RIGHT INFORMATION AT THE RIGHT TIME WHILE ALSO BEING COST EFFECTIVE. TMC IS EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE DEVELOPING AND AMP PROGRAMMING THE WEST COAST GOUNDFISH FISHERY ANDWE'VE LEARNED THAT GETTING IT RIGHT WILL REQUIRE A COLLABORATIVE PROCESS. THAT MUST BEGIN WITH CLEARLY DEFINED MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES INCLUDE FISHERMEN AND THE TESTING EMBEDDING OF TOOLS AND DELIVER RELIABLE DATA MANAGERS. SECOND ASSISTANT SPOKEN TO WE NEED TO LEVERAGE PARTNERSHIPS TO FILL CRITICAL DATA GAPS ON THE LOCATION OF WHALES AND ENABLE AND COST EFFECTIVE MANNER MANNER. WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THE PILOT THAT WE PARTNERED WITH THE CALIFORNIA COAST PROPOSITION ON LAST YEAR TO DESIGN IT I LIVE IN INDUSTRY WIDE SURVEY. THE PILOT WAS REALLY SUCCESSFUL WE- WE IN FACT THE SERVINGS ON ONE LED TO THE FIRST EVER USE OF ADULTS RESTRICTION UNDER THE RAMP BY FILLING A KEY DATA GAP. AND WE SEE THAT THIS MODEL CAN UNIQUELY COMPLEMENT OTHER DATA SOURCES INCLUDING EMERGING SPECIES DISTRIBUTION MODELS THE PHONE BILL GRAHAM MONITORING REQUIREMENTS WHILE ALSO INCREASING INDUSTRY CONFIDENCE AND ENGAGEMENT. HOWEVER ADDITIONAL RESOURCES ARE NEEDED TO SUPPORT AND EXPAND THIS TRIAL AS PART OF A BROADER MONITORING STRATEGY. SO WE SUPPORT THE FUNDING REQUEST FOR THESE INDUSTRY SURVEYS INCLUDED IN THE DUNGENESS CRAB TASK FORCE RECOMMENDATIONS LAST WEEK. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CRITICAL TO THE ONGOING PROTECTION OF WHALES AND LONG TERM HEALTH OF THE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY IN THE MANY COMMUNITIES THAT% DEPEND ON IT. THE CLIMATE IMPACTS THOSE AN URGENT THREAT TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S FISHERIES. SO WE MUST ALSO BE VIEWING THIS AS AN OPPORTUNITY AND AN URGENT ONE TO OUTLINE A HOLISTIC TRANSFORMATION OF ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S DISTRICT DATA COLLECTION AND MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. SO WHILE THERE MAY BE DIFFERENCES IN THE CHALLENGES EACH FISHERY FACES CLIMATE READY FISHERIES MANAGEMENT CALLS FOR SOME BROADLY APPLIED BOOKING GRADIENTS. BY CLEARLY DEFINED DATA NEEDS AND PRIORITIES LEVERAGING TECHNOLOGY LIKE DIGITAL RECORDING TOOLS AND EXPANDED USE OF PARTNERSHIPS TO FILL DATA GAPS. AND JUST LIKE THE CRITICAL ROLE THIS COMMITTEE'S LEADERSHIP AND VISION HAS PLAYED IN ADVANCING SOLUTIONS THE WELL TAKE A ISSUE. TRANSFORMING CALIFORNIA'S DATA SYSTEMS. REQUIRE COMMITTED LEADERSHIP AMBITION. SOMETHING CLOSE WE APPRECIATE THE ONGOING DEDICATION OF THIS COMMITTEE AND LOOK FORWARD TO OUR CONTINUED COLLABORATION. WITH CDFW THE OPC FISHERMEN SCIENTISTS AND NGOS. AS WE CONTINUE TO PURSUE DATA DRIVEN MANAGEMENT TO IMPROVE OUTCOMES MARINE LIFE AND FISHERIES. THANKS VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY AND HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU SO MUCH THIS SUMMER SOME SUMMERS ON IS THE FISHERIES PROJECT DIRECTOR FOR THE NATURE CONSERVANCY WE'RE GRATEFUL TO ALL OF OUR PANELISTS. IN THE TICKET RIGHT INTO IT HERE WE TALKED ABOUT. THIS PILOT REGARDS THIS SURVEY THAT REALLY GIVES ON THE GROUND OR ON THE OCEAN ICE- ON WHERE THE WHALES ARE AT AND WHAT WE HEARD FROM THE DIRECTOR EARLIER TODAY EVEN THOUGH THE STATE. HAS PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT TO BE ABLE TO DO- AERIAL SURVEYS OF WALES- OIL SPILLS YOU NAME IT- WE'RE GONNA NEED EYES AND EARS OUT ON THE OCEAN AND THAT'S WHAT- MR PLATT IN DECEMBER SOME IS BEEN WORKING ON- SO LET'S. GET INTO THAT A LITTLE BIT I KNOW THAT THIS IS A RECOMMENDATION COMING FROM THE WORKING GROUP. BUT MISS HAMMER STONE IN ALL GO TO MR PLAN TO TALK ABOUT THIS AS WELL. I BELIEVE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE WORKING GROUP ON THE BUDGET NUMBERS AND WHAT THAT REQUEST WILL BE- AND I THINK WAITING FOR AN OBVIOUSLY THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO BE ABLE TO. EXPLORE AS WELL I MISS. SOME OF YOUR CAKE IS OFTEN WILL GO TO MISTER PLAQUE. HAPPY YOU KNOW WHEN I DO BELIEVE I'M SUPPOSED TO HAVE. TO GO SOME NOT. THAT I'M CORRESPOND TO THE COST AND FOR THE PLANNING OF A VESSELS ON THE WATER. I'M IN SO I THINK WE CAN PROVIDE AND DOESN'T FOLLOW UP INCLUDING WITH AND TO DO THAT AND THAT'S JUST ONE OF THE RESOURCES THAT GOES INTO THE PILOT. ON TO THE PROGRAM. AND THE TOTAL COST OF THAT WILL DEPEND ON HOW MANY SURVEYS WERE DOING- PER YEAR BUT WE'VE GOT SOME ESTIMATES OF. OF WHAT A GOOD. SECOND YEAR PILOT WOULD LOOK LIKE- IN ADDITION I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO HIGHLIGHT ALL THE OTHER IN KIND SERVICES AND THAT. YOU KNOW WE'VE ALL BEEN KIND OF STRUGGLING TOGETHER IN PROVIDING INCLINE- BUT IN THE LONG TERM WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THERE IS- YOU KNOW STILL COORDINATION SERVICE SAYS- THEY CAN BE AVAILABLE AND THE LONG TERM. AND WE'RE CONTINUING TO WORK WITH CDFW TO THAT TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW. IF THEY HAVE INCREASED STAFF CAPACITY- TO SEE WHAT ROLES WE CAN WORK OUT IN TERMS OF THE DATA CENTER SYSTEM MANAGEMENT SO. THERE'S A FEW THINGS TO KEEP IN MIND ONE IS KIND OF. MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING FAIR COMPENSATION TO THE FISHERMEN WHO ARE- YOU KNOW SPENDING TIME AND GAS MONEY OUT THERE ON THE WATER- BUT THERE'S OTHER ROLES ON ALL THE COORDINATION THAT IT TAKES TO ENGAGE OUR SCIENTIFIC ADVISORS. FOLKS OUT ON THE WATER ON THE SAME DAY. WHEN WE HAVE THE RIGHT WINDOWS AND THEN TAKE ALL THE DATA THAT'S COMING IN AND MAKE SURE THAT IT'S ABLE TO BE USED. TURN AROUND QUICKLY AND HOUSTON RAMP DECISION MAKING. THANK. YOU SO MUCH I MISS A PACK COMMENTS ON THIS. YEAH I DON'T KNOW. THANKS FOR I DON'T HAVE A WHOLE. TO SAY. JAN IS REALLY COVERED A LOT OF IT- I HEARD HERSELF IN JOHN GONZALES WHOSE ARE- PROCESSOR REPRESENTATIVE ON THE BOARD OF THE TRIPLE CA REALLY DID A FANTASTIC JOB WITH THEM THE PILOT PROGRAM AND- THEN THE FISHERMEN THAT. ARE VOLUNTEERING TO. TO DO THIS- YOU KNOW ARE ARE ARE REALLY DOING IT BECAUSE- THEY'RE TRYING TO HELP C. F. W. AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE FILL IN THE DATA GAPS DOWN. AND PROVIDE AS MUCH REAL TIME DATA AS POSSIBLE- SO THAT THEY MAY BE ABLE TO USE SOFTER MANAGEMENT. TOOLS LIKE CHEF RESTRICTIONS IN THE SPRING INSTEAD OF CLOSING THE WHOLE. STATE OR THE WHOLE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE SO- WE ARE MOTIVATED- PRIMARILY BY TRYING TO EXPAND OUR SEASONS BUT WE ARE ALSO. MOTIVATED BY HAVING THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE AND WE WERE WILLING TO- YOU KNOW EVER WE WERE WILLING TO LIVE OR DIE BY THE SWORD AND THAT SORT IS. THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE SO- IF WE CAN DO YOU KNOW IF WE CAN PROVIDE THE DATA THAT HELPS KEEP THE SEASON OPEN A LITTLE LONGER EVERY SEASON. OR HELPS CONVINCE- THE STATE THAT IT'S SAFE TO FINISH INSIDE A CERTAIN DEPTH. RESTRICTION AT CERTAIN TIME OF YEAR AND CERTAIN FISHING ZONES AND THEN WE'RE OFF FOR- THE NATURE CONSERVANCY REALLY STEPPED UP IN JUNE IN PARTICULAR HELPING PROVIDE. TEMPORARY FUNDING FOR OUR PILOT PROJECTS THE GUYS DON'T. REQUIRE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY TO GO OUT THERE YOU KNOW SOME OF SOME OF THEM ACTUALLY TOOK THE MONEY THEY WERE. GIVEN FURTHER EXPENSES IN JUST STARTING YOU KNOW BACK TO THE SITUATION SO WE CAN LOG YOU GET STATE FIVE THIRTY FOUR- SO WE'RE NOT ASKING FOR AN INFLATED BUDGET WE WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE. THE LEGISLATURE AND- CDFW COMMIT TO THE PROGRAM COMMITTEE. STAFF YEAH. IT STILL SOURCES OF FUNDING. AND LET IN LAST YEAR PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH. ARE A I- AND X. ALL THE POSSIBILITIES UNDER THE RAMP WALK THAT FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS- SO WE'RE ALL FOR IT AND I'D LIKE EVERYONE TO KNOW THAT MIKE HAS BEEN. VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THIS IDEA FROM THE FIRST TIME I BROUGHT IT UP IN A PRIVATE MEETING. I HAD ALSO I WANTED TO POINT OUT THAT- IT KNOWLEDGE. THAT THE SENATOR HAS REALLY HELPED THE FISHING INDUSTRY LATELY AND HELPING TO- APPLY PRESSURE ON CDFW TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS UNIDENTIFIABLE CURE. TYPE ISSUE AND THAT IT'S- A FAIRLY SIMPLE PROBLEM THAT CAN BE SOLVED ON. THE STREET SHOULD NOT BE CHARGED UNFAIRLY FORTY SEVEN AND IDENTIFY YOUR- INTERACTIONS SO- WE REALLY HAVE HAD BETTER. COMMUNICATION WITH THE STATE AGAIN WITH- STOMP THE FISHERIES- COMMITTEE AND IN PARTICULAR. A SENATOR MCGUIRE AND THINGS ARE ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO I WANTED TO ACKNOWLEDGE IT PUBLICLY MIKE THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISS FIVE LOVE WORKING WITH YOU- IN VERY GREAT WOULD BE TO WORK WITH YOUR MEMBERS AS WELL. IN A IN THE TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT I KNOW WHAT WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE BIT TIGHT ON TIME BUT- MISAPPLIED. BUT YOURSELF MISTER CONNERY BROUGHT UP THE FACT IN REGARDS TO IT LET'S JUST SAY THERE'S A WHALE AND BY THE WAY- THIS FISHERY DUNGENESS CRAB STEP FORWARD PROACTIVELY TO BE ABLE TO WORK WITH US TO BE ABLE TO PASS LEGISLATION. ON GEAR TRAP RETRIEVAL. IS WELL AS GEAR MARKINGS AND NOW WHAT IS HAPPENING IS IF A WELL FOR EXAMPLE SWIMS UP FROM THE SOUTH. FROM MEXICO OR SWIMS FROM THE NORTH TO THE SOUTH COMING. IN FROM ANOTHER STATE. DAISY I- IN TANGO IN- GEAR AND- SEE. OR THE FED CAN'T IDENTIFY THAT GEAR IS IT AUTOMATICALLY FALLS ON THE JUDGE'S CRAB FISHERY. THAT IS ABSOLUTELY NOT FAIR ESPECIALLY SINCE- THE DUNGEONS CRAB FISHERY THE FLEET HAS STEPPED UP. TIME AND TIME AGAIN TO BE ABLE TO. MARK THEIR GEAR AT PURCHASE THERE LAST YEAR BACK IN TO RETRIEVE LOST YEAR I THINK THAT IS THERE'S A- THERE'S A LOOPHOLE IN ESPECIALLY WHEN STAKES ARE SO HIGH- IF A MARINE MAMMAL IS ENTANGLED. IN THEY CAN'T FIGURE OUT WHERE IT CAME FROM IT AUTOMATICALLY FALLS IN THE FISHERY MR CONROY THEY'LL GO TO MR PLATT- YOUR COMMENT ON THAT I KNOW THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL WORKING ON. TO BE ABLE TO GET THIS THING FIXED. THANKS FOR THAT. QUESTION THE CENTER REQUIRE IT IT IS A BIG PROBLEM AND HOPEFULLY WITH A YEAH. BUT THE NEXT VERSION OF RANT RANCH TWO POINT OH YOU KNOW WE CAN INCORPORATE MORE UPDATED SCIENCE IN TERMS OF THE NUMBERS OF WELLS THAT ARE AVAILABLE AND WITH MY MARKETING YOU KNOW THAT YOUR IDENTIFICATION THAT PASS THROUGH THE STATE LEGISLATURE RECENTLY YOU KNOW THE NUMBERS OF UNKNOWN ENTANGLEMENTS WILL ACTUALLY BE REDUCED AND GIVEN THAT HOPEFULLY THE IMPACT THAT IT HAS ON. THE CRAB FISHERY WILL BE REDUCED AS WELL- IT'S ONE OF THOSE UNFORTUNATE RESULTS AND I THINK YOU KNOW THE DEPARTMENT IS SHE HAS BEEN WILLING TO WORK WITH THE WORKING GROUP IN TERMS OF LOOKING AT THOSE UNKNOWN ENTANGLEMENTS IN AN EFFORT TO. IF WE CAN'T RULE OUT. THE DEEP CRAP FISHERY AS A POTENTIAL CULPRIT THEN THAT WON'T COUNT AGAINST YOU CRABTREE. AND WE SAW THAT WITH A SPERM WHALE THAT WAS ENTANGLED I THINK IT WAS IN JUNE OF TWENTY TWENTY. DOT UP SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JUST JUST LOOKING AT THE PICTURES OF THE OFFENDING HERE ITSELF YOU CAN CLEARLY SEE THAT IT WAS MONOFILAMENT BASED AND COULD NOT HAVE BEEN ATTRIBUTED TO THE DUNGEONS CRABTREE. SO THAT ONE EVEN THOUGH IT REMAINS UNKNOWN WAS NOT DID NOT COUNT AGAINST THE G. TROUT FISHERY SO. ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO. FURTHER VET THESE UNDER UNTANGLE INCENTIVE POSSIBLE. RULE OUT THE DEPRESSED FISHERY ALL THE BETTER. THANK YOU M. S. FIVE. YEAH I WOULD- ECHO WHAT WHAT MIKE HAS TO SAY ABOUT THAT AND- IT IS ONE OF THE MOST GLARING PROBLEMS WITH THE ORIGINAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT- WHICH INCLUDED A CHARGE FOR UNIDENTIFIED TYPE CONTAINMENT SO- GIVEN THAT DATA MEETING TO RAP OR WE'RE HAVING TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO- CORRECT THAT ISSUE BECAUSE IT CAN SERIOUSLY LIMIT THE COMMERCIAL FISHERY FOR NO GOOD REASON. THE WAY IT STANDS RIGHT NOW I WOULD LIKE TO TAKE A LITTLE BIT OF TIME LEFT TO MENTION THAT THE OTHER PIECE OF THIS YEAR'S. D. THE FISHERY IS ALREADY DOING A REALLY GOOD JOB OF CLEANING UP THEIR OWN HERE HERE THAT COULD LATER BECOME AN IDENTIFIABLE BECAUSE OF MONSTER MOVIES OR- MOVIES THAT HAVE BEEN BROKEN OFF FOR- SUBMERGED- GEAR. SO- INITIALLY AND EVEN MORE SO TODAY WE ARE IN THE HABIT OF BRINGING IN ANY ABOUT IT- THAT WE SEE WHILE WE'RE FISHING DURING THE SEASON AFTER ALWAYS BEING BROUGHT TO THE DOCTOR IN SEASON. BY CRAP ABOUT SOULS AND PEOPLE OR PEOPLE THAT ON THE CRAB TRAPS GET CALLED IN THE COMING PICK UP THEIR EAR. AT THE END OF THE SEASON- I THINK FOR THE LAST MAYBE FIVE OR SIX YEARS NOW- THE NATURE CONSERVANCY AND OTHER HAPPEN BABY ASSOCIATION WERE PARTNERED IN A LOST YEAR RECOVERY PROGRAM. IT STARTED AND HOW BASED SIX. IN SPANISH AS SAN FRANCISCO. BAY AND FURTHER NORTH. AND HOUSE OF LAST YEAR- ARE ASSOCIATION BEGAN TO SPONSOR THAT- IT'S STILL STATEWIDE CONDOMINIUMS IN INFANCY BUT- THE IDEA IS THAT AS SOON AS THE SEASON IS OVER WE HAVE- RETRIEVAL TEAMS IN EVERY PORT. EASTER GUYS THAT ARE HIRED TO- GO OUT AND GET PAID FOR EVERY LOSS HOT THAT THEY FIND SO WE'RE DOING. ALMOST A 100% YOUR RECOVERY NOW THERE'S VIRTUALLY NO LOST YEAR- AS AS LONG AS WE CONTINUE TO BE ALLOWED TO GO OUT AND GET THESE PARTS AND THEY WILL I BELIEVE IT'LL IMPROVE EVERY YEAR. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THAT BE A- THE NEXT PRIORITY FOR THE STATE IN TERMS OF CRACK HERE IS. IS FINDING MORE FUNDING AVAILABLE- FOR THESE LOST YOUR RECOVERY PROGRAMS SHOULD NOT BE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY. AT A LOCAL ASSOCIATIONS- DURCH DIE THIS SUCH A BIG ISSUE THE LAST YEAR BUT TO ACTUALLY DIED. IT IS- IT IS LITERALLY OUR JOB TO CLEAN UP OUR SIDE OF THE STREET. WE ARE MOTIVATED TO DO THAT- BUT IT WOULD REALLY HELP IF THE STATE WOULD GET BEHIND IT AND WE COULD HAVE MORE CONSISTENCY IN THAT EFFORT. AND BE ABLE TO GET YOU A 100% OF YOUR RETRIEVAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER PLATT AND VERY GRATEFUL FOR THOSE COMMENTS RIGHT THERE PRESENTLY CALIFORNIA CONSCRIPTED SITUATION. I WANT TO GO TO OUR FINAL- QUESTION IN THAT TOO DOCTOR ANDERSON DR ANDERSON. WHO IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COASTAL OCEAN OBSERVING SYSTEMS. DOCTOR ANDERSON TEN YEARS AGO CALIFORNIANS REALLY DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT DEMO CASSIDY AND DEMO CASTED. THE CHALLENGES THE DEMO GASOLINE FOR EXAMPLE HARMFUL ALGAL BLOOM. UP DOES FOR DATE FOR IN PARTICULAR FOR- THE DUNGENESS CRAB INDUSTRY WHERE LET'S GET RIGHT TO THIS IS A QUESTION WE GET A LOT FROM REPORTERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. WHERE'D IT COME FROM IS IT RELATED TO WARMING- OCEAN CAN. IS IT RELATED TO CLIMATE. DOCTORS IN YOU DON'T MIND GIVING A AN ABC. ON USED OKAY. IN WHY IS IT SUCH A FORCE NOW- WHEN IT COMES TO THE FISHER. IT'S A GREAT QUESTION I'LL TRY TO BE QUICK- BECAUSE IT'S A BIG ONE AND YOU KNOW IT'S BEEN AROUND A LONG TIME. SIGNATURES AND NATURALLY OCCURRING DIET TIME IN OUR SYSTEM. IT'S HARDLY NEW- THERE'S A INTERESTING EVIDENCE THAT SOMEWHERE IN. THE EARLY NINETIES IT DID SORT OF TURN ON AND MUCH HIGHER ABUNDANCE THAN IT USED TO BE ALTHOUGH THIS THIS STILL STANDS FOR DEBATE- BUT WE HAVE LOOKED AT. TIMES OR IS IT THE MOST ACCESS TO THE BEST WE CAN IN LIKES YOU CAN ACTUALLY LOOK IN THE SEDIMENTS AND SEDIMENT TRAPS AND GET THE DEMO LIKE ACID OUT OF THEM. AND WE'VE DONE THAT AND SEEN IT REALLY DOES RAMP UP AROUND THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND NINE I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IT SEEMS LIKE TEN YEARS AGO WAS WHEN WE REALLY STARTED HEARING ABOUT IT. IT WAS REALLY THE BLOGGING YOU START HEARING ABOUT IT BUT- IT WAS A PROBLEM AND THEY WERE HOT SPOTS IN OUR CHANNEL WAS ALWAYS A BIG HOT SPOT AND THAT'S WHERE I STARTED WORKING ON IT- YOU CAN GO BACK TO THE NINETIES AND EARLY TWO THOUSANDS AND SEE SOME DRAMATIC CASES OF BIRD AND SEEN THEM ALL. WE'RE TELLING THE EVENTS OKAY SO THAT BEING SAID. AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN TIME WHAT WE STARTED TO NOTICE IN THIS TIME SERIES WAS THAT WHERE IT USED TO BE THREE TO FOUR YEAR OCCURRENCE NOW IT'S EVERY SINGLE YEAR. YOU CAN COUNT ON IT FOR THE MOST PART SOMEWHERE IN CALIFORNIA- AND WHY THAT IS WE'RE NOT A 100% SURE BUT WE'RE LOOKING AT A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS INCLUDING NOT JUST TEMPERATURE. BUT THE WAY THAT THE NUTRIENT CHEMISTRY HAS CHANGED IN THE OCEAN AND- THAT NUTRI CHEMISTRY CHANGES IN. RESPONSE TO LARGE SCALE PATTERNS. THE R. CAN. TO ITS- IN. PACIFIC CAN BELIEVE. SO THESE ARE PATTERNS THAT CHANGED WHEN- WHEN CIRCULATION PATTERNS CHANGE OVER A LARGE AREA LIKE THE PACIFIC AND NORTH PACIFIC- WHY THAT WOULD BE WELL THERE'S A LOT OF HYPOTHESES OUT THERE ABOUT HOW IT DOES. CONNECT BACK TO THE BIGGER GLOBAL PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE- THE EXACT MECHANISMS FOR HOW WE END UP WITH THE DIFFERENT- KIND OF NUTRIENT WATER THAT FUELS ARE APPALLING IS DIFFERENT IT'S HARD TO SAY. SO WE ARE HOMING IN ON A LOT OF DIFFERENT HYPOTHESES WARMING IS ONE OF THEM THE MOVEMENT OF SPECIES WITHOUT WARNING- NOT ALL SIGNATURE ARE. CREATED EQUAL IN THE SENSE THAT SOME ARE REALLY HOT COMPARED TO OTHERS- AND THOSE HOT ONES SEEM TO BE RESPONDING MAYBE- A LITTLE MORE DON'T. WARMING AND THERE IS EVIDENCE AND ALL KINDS OF RESEARCH THAT. WARMING AND INCREASED. OR DECREASED PH IN THE WATER IT'S THE HARMFUL ALGAL SPECIES ARE THE REALLY TOXIC ONES THAT TEND TO RESPOND THE MOST. WHAT I. NOT A 100% SURE BUT- IT DOES SEEM LIKE THERE IS A CONNECTION AND THAT MIGHT BE WHY. WE CONTINUE TO SEE THE SMART FORWARD AND I WOULD JUST SAY THAT. WHEN I STARTED WORKING ON THIS AND ONE OF THE REASONS I MENTIONED THE THRESHOLDS WHEN I MENTIONED THE MODEL SO THAT WE MIGHT NEED TO REVISE THOSE. WHAT MADE A REALLY HIGH PARTICULATE DEMO GAS CITY EVENT IN OUR MINDS. AND LET'S SAY AROUND THE EARLY TWO THOUSANDS WEST FIVE HUNDRED NANOGRAMS PER LITER. NOW DURING THAT THE BLOCK WHEN I FIRST TESTIFIED WITH YOU- WE WERE MADE ME REALIZE HOW MOBILE IS NOW A NEW HOT SPOT WE HAD NEVER. SEEN THAT BEFORE MAYBE BECAUSE WE WEREN'T MEASURING. BUT WE STARTED TO GET WATER. CONCENTRATIONS ON THE LEVEL OF A HUNDRED THOUSAND ANAGRAMS LEADER AND MORE SO YOU CAN JUST SEE THE SCALE OF WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT. JUST HOW DRAMATICALLY THINGS HAVE CHANGED. SINCE YOU KNOW TWO DECADES AGO ENTERTAINERS AND I KNOW WE'RE RUNNING A LITTLE LATE BUT YOU JUST QUICKLY. E. SO YOU YOU ALSO. BELIEVE THAT. THERE COULD BE LAN BASE. MATERIAL THAT FLOW. OUT INTO THE OCEAN IS ALSO CAUSING THIS JUST IF YOU DON'T MIND GIVE US SOME SNIPPETS ON YOUR HYPOTHESIS ON THIS. I WOULD JUST CAUTION AND SAY WELL I THINK- LAND BASED NUTRIENTS CAN PLAY A ROLE I DON'T THINK THERE'S A COST FOR THE KIND OF CHANGES WERE SEEN HER SAY WHAT I THINK. THE ROLE THAT THEY PLAY IS THEY COULD PROBABLY POSSIBLY MAKE AN EVENT MORE TOXIC- THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT IF YOU HAVE AN EXTENT STUDENT YOU BLEW THE WATER LET'S SAY MODERATE PAIN YOU GET A BIG. ATMOSPHERIC RIVER EVENT A LOT OF FLOW FROM SANTA PANCHA WROTE THAT THOSE CELLS CAN TRAIN MORE TOXIC- AND THAT HAS TO DO AGAIN WITH MUSIC BOX NOW THE IDEA THAT WE HAVE ENOUGH RIVER FLOW ALL THE TIME THAT WHENEVER WE SEE A GIVEN THE MOST ACCIDENTS BECAUSE OF LAND BASED NUTRIENTS THAT'S NOT QUITE RIGHT- THEIR SYNERGISTIC. AND THEY CAN WORK OFF OF ONE ANOTHER BUT I WOULD SAY IT'S A BIGGER ISSUE THAT'S DRIVING THE TREND THAT YOU REFERENCED IN YOUR QUESTION EARLIER. THANK YOU SO MUCH DOCTOR ANDERSON THAT WHAT A FANTASTIC PANEL- TALKING ABOUT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWENTY TWO DUNGEONS CRAB SEASON THANK YOU THAT'S DR KRISTA ANDERSON WE WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO BEN PLATT MY CON RIGHT. JEANNE HARBOR SEWN THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING WITH US TODAY ALL STAR PANEL AND ALL ISSUES AT DUNGENESS CRAB- I GOTTA TELL YOU MICHAEL WHO WE WORK TOGETHER HERE AND HE'S DONE SUCH A GREAT JOB GOODNESS- HEARING GOING. HE'S READY FOR SOME DUNGEONS CRAP AT IS WHAT HE'S TELLING ME SO- LET'S GET THIS THESE BOATS OUT IN THE SEASON OPEN AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE MAKING SURE THAT WELLS ARE SAFE OF COURSE. ALL RIGHT WE'RE NOT GONNA BE MOVING FORWARD TO OUR FISHERY COMMITTEE NOVEL CULTURE PROGRAM REPORTS THAT WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF THIS NEXT PANEL. WE'RE GONNA BE HEARING- UPDATES FROM AT THIS PANEL ON IMPORTANT FISHERY PROGRAMS THROUGHOUT THE CITY CALIFORNIA WE'RE GOING TO GET RIGHT INTO IT BECAUSE- SHOW FISHER. HAS ANOTHER MEETING AND I DO APOLOGIZE BUT FISHER WERE RUNNING BEHIND SHE IS WITH THE ALL STAR ADMINISTRATIVE TEAM OF THE DUNGEON SCRIPT TASK FORCE HE'S GONNA PROVIDE US AN UPDATE ON THE CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB TASK FOR STATUS. AND WHAT IS AHEAD- HERE. FOR TWENTY TWENTY TWO MISS FISHER THANK YOU SO MUCH YOU'RE ASIANS I KNOW YOU GOING TO PUT. IN YOUR BECAUSE REAL SO I'LL TURN THE FLOOR- OVER TO YOU. KNOW THINK YOU SO MUCH FOR WELL. YEP YEP THAT'S I THOUGHT I THOUGHT. I WAS ON MUTE THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR INTEREST. AND IN THIS A GREAT SEGUE FROM THE LAST PANEL. AND SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN UPDATE ON BEHALF THE D. C. T. S. SINCE THE LAST. UPDATE THIS COMMITTEE IN MARCH TWENTY TWENTY. THE C. T. S. MAY TWO REPORTS THE JOINT COMMITTEE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE THE OPC IN THE FISHING GAME COMMISSION. AND THESE REPORTS INCLUDE RECOMMENDATIONS BASED ON THE TASK FORCE'S DISCUSSIONS HELD IN OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY AND MARCH TWENTY TWENTY ONE. ON BEHALF OF THE DC CHAP ABOUT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE ESPECIALLY CHAIRMAN CHOIR FOR YOUR RESPONSIVENESS TO DCHS RECENT RECOMMENDATIONS. WHICH AS YOU KNOW FROM. THE BASIS FOR A SPEEDY. BLACK WEEK I. A HOC TWENTY SEVENTH AND EIGHT THE DCT ASK NOT TO DISCUSS PRIORITY TOPICS. AND SPEED MINISTRY OF TEAM IS CURRENTLY WORKING ON A REPORT INFORMED BY THAT MEETING THAT WILL BE SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE ON OR BEFORE JANUARY FIFTEENTH ONCE IT'S BEEN REVIEWED BY THE DCT ASK. BUT I'D LIKE TO USE THIS TIME TO JUST PROVIDE SOME- TO SHARE SOME OF WHAT THE- RECOMMENDATIONS AND REQUESTS ARE THAT YOU CAN ANTICIPATE IN THAT REPORT. SO THE MOST RECENT ACCOUNTING OF THE TENSIONS CRAP ACCOUNT PROVIDED BY THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED MY LIFE WAS FOR THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN FISHING SEASON. AND SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS RECOMMENDATION THE DCF MADE A REQUEST FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO PROVIDE AN ANNUAL ACCOUNTING ATTENTION IS CRAP ACCOUNTS AS MANDATED BY FISHING GAME CODE SECTION EIGHTY TO SEVENTY SIX POINT FIVE. THEY ALSO ASKED IF THERE WERE EVER RECOMMENDED THAT IF THERE WERE ANY EXCESS FUNDS IN THE ACCOUNTBEYOND WHAT IS REQUIRED BY THE LEGISLATURE WHICH WE UNDERSTAND TO BE A TWO YEAR RESEARCH. THAT THE DC TF REQUESTED BEASTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIAL TRAP. COMMERCIAL CRAB TRAP LIMIT PROGRAM BE REDUCED TO REFLECT THE REVENUE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. WITHOUT CREATING MORE OF A SURPLUS. THE DISEASE HAVE ALSO REAFFIRMS THAT RECOMMENDATION FROM OCTOBER TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN TO THE CURRENT NINETY SIX HOURS YOU'RE SERVICING REQUIREMENTS FISHING GAME CODE SECTION NINE THOUSAND FOUR. TO ALLOWING NINETY SOAK TIME IN A LIE IN ALIGNMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA RECREATIONAL DUNGENESS CRAB FISHERY. DCF APPRECIATES THE CONCERNS THAT SOME OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS HAVE SHARED ABOUT THE INCREASE SERVICE INTERVAL HOWEVER AT THE DEJECTED STATE THAT THERE IS. NO EVIDENCE THAT AN INCREASE SERVICEABLE BELIEVED TO MARK YOUR LAST- DEAR DISPLACEMENT OR AN INCREASING TENANT RISK. THEY ALSO STATED THAT THERE ARE A NUMBER OF TOOLS THAT ARE EITHER IN PLACE OR WILL BE IN PLACE IN THE FUTURE TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS ABOUT TRACKING LAST YEAR AND SOME OF THOSE THINGS ARE- BY WEEKLY REPORTING THAT IS SENT TO THE DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE THE MANDATING OF ELECTRONIC MONITORING BY THE TWENTY TWENTY THREE SEASON. AND A LOST FISHING GEAR RECOVERY PROGRAM THAT TAT AND PLAQUES REFERRED TO EARLIER WHERE PERMIT HOLDERS ARE. CHARGED FOR CAN'T RECOVER AFTER SEASON. IN RESPONSE TO ISSUE OF IN TANDEM IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE RAMP FIFTY CTF DEVELOPED TO RECOMMENDATIONS THAT ARE VERY REFLECTIVE OF WHAT YOU HEARD EARLIER IN THE LAST PANEL. THE DISEASE HAVE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION AT THE FISHERIES PENALIZED BY UNIDENTIFIED GEAR INVOLVED IN AN ENTANGLEMENT AND THE DC CHIEF RECOMMENDED THAT THE TENSIONS PRACTITIONER WORKING GROUP DISCUSSING CONSIDER THE COST BENEFIT PLAN MARKING. FOR ALL FIXED YOUR FISHERIES AND PROVIDE GUIDANCE FOR THE DUNGENESS CRAB TASK FORCE'S DISCUSSION. AND THIS MAY BE SOMETHING THAT WILL REQUIRE LEGISLATIVE ATTENTION THE FUTURE- IN THIS MOMENT I THINK THAT THEY'RE STILL MORE DISCUSSION NEEDS TO BE HIGH. HOWEVER THE DC CHIEF IS REQUESTING SUPPORT FROM THE LEGISLATURE ON DATA INPUTS TO INFORM THE RAMP AS WE HEARD FROM THE PRIOR PANEL. THESE INDUSTRY WIDE SURVEYS THAT- TROUBLE CA THE CALIFORNIA COAST CROWD ASSOCIATION AND THE NATURE CONSERVANCY COLLABORATED ON. THE PC CHASSIS IS A LOT OF VALUE IN THE EAST. AND THE DC TF RECOMMENDS CONTINUING THOSE SURVEYS TO GENERATE RELIABLE USEFUL INFORMATION THAT CAN BE GAINED AN OFFICIAL DATA SOURCED BY. ME BY THE DEPARTMENT TO INFORM THE RAMP. DCF REQUESTED THAT THE LEGISLATURE IDENTIFY CONSISTENT FUNDING SOURCE TO SUPPORT THIS DATA COLLECTION LONG TERM. AND LASTLY THE DTF DISCUSSED THE NEED FOR MORE GUIDANCE FROM THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION ABOUT HOW TO LEGALLY FISH WITH THE USE OF A STARBUCKS. SO MIKE JUST MENTION TO SOMEONE TO GO IN IN THE LAST CANDLE BUT- DUE TO A PENDING LEGAL ISSUE THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE WAS UNABLE TO FULLY ENGAGE IN A CONVERSATION BESIDES ANSWERING LAMINATE. CLARIFYING QUESTIONS. WHILE FORMAL RECOMMENDATION ON THIS TOPIC WILL NOT BE FORWARDED AT THIS TIME SOME DC CHAPTER MEMBERS REQUESTED THAT THE TOPIC HE REVISITED ONCE THE LEGAL ISSUE IS RESOLVED AND THERE CAN BE A MORE COLLABORATIVE DISCUSSION WITH THE DEPARTMENT. IN THE MEANTIME THE DC TFT PROVIDES AN INFORMAL GUIDANCE ON THE ISSUE AND THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE IN THE FINAL MEETING SUMMARY THAT WILL ALSO. BE MADE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE. VERY SOON. I'M IN CLOSING ON BEHALF OF THE DC ASK AND IT'S TEAM THANK YOU SENATOR IN THE COMMITTEE YOUR POSITIVE AT THE DC GUIDANCE TO DATE AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE THIS UPDATE AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS FOR THE NEXT NINE MINUTES ALL RIGHT THERE WE GO JOHN IS GOING TO SAY THAT THE BOTTOM LINE FOR US AND THAT SORT BOX ISSUE. I'M JUST BEING BLUNT AND IT'S GONNA GIVE YOU MY OPINION WE GOT TO GET THIS FRIGGING THING FIGURED OUT AND I THINK THAT THERE'S SOME COMMON SENSE SOLUTIONS OUT THERE AND- NO OPPENHEIM WHO YOU KNOW WELL IN AS INTERIM CHIEF CONSULTANT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU ON THAT BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING REGARDLESS IF CDFW CAN ENGAGE OR NOT THAT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO GET- FIGURED OUT HERE THIS YEAR SO I AGAIN COMMON SENSE APPROACH. ON THIS ITEM. AND THERE WERE SOME TASK FORCE MEMBERS THAT THAT DO YOU WANT TO SEE SOMETHING AND- THEY'RE NOT SURE IF IT'S A LEGISLATIVE FIX OR IF ITS GUIDANCE Q. L. TO. THE LAW ENFORCEMENT DIVISION ON HOW TO INTERPRET THE LAW. BUT SOME FOLKS SAID YOU KNOW THAT THEY WERE JUST HESITANT TO MAKE A RECOMMENDATION WITHOUT REALLY UNDERSTANDING HOW THINGS ARE GOING TO PLAY OUT AND ABSOLUTELY HERE THE CONCERN THAT. YOU FOLKS DON'T WANT TO BE CRIMINALIZED FOR YOU KNOW HOW THEY HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY FISHING SINCE. THEY STARTED FISHING THERE'S ROOM TO ABSOLUTELY- WE WILL DEFINITELY FOLLOW UP ON THAT- IS WELL AND I HAVE THAT ON MY- FOLLOW UP AND I KNOW MISTER OPPENHEIM. WILL ALSO BE FOLLOWING UP ON THAT. THAT IS MISS FISHER FROM THE CALIFORNIA JUST CRAP TASK FORCE. AND AGAIN IT IS OUR FAULT WE'RE RUNNING LATE THIS FISHER THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M REALLY GRATEFUL. THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY AND I KNOW YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO CUT OUT FOR ANOTHER MEETING SO THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR PARTICIPATION. WE'RE NOW TO BE MOVING FORWARD TO MR LEVEL MR LEVEL IS A HARDWORKING AQUACULTURE COORDINATOR FOR THE CAPTAIN APARTMENT. THAT FISH AND WILDLIFE WE WELCOME MR LEVEL TWO COMMITTEE YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND WE'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT WHEN YOU GET TOWARDS THE END. MR LEVEL GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR YOUR SERVICE YOU HAVE THE FLOOR. THANK YOU. ARE VERY MUCH APPRECIATE YOUR KIND WORDS AND- HELLO SENATOR HUESO APPRECIATE YOU INVITING ME TO SPEAK. AQUACULTURE IN CALIFORNIA IS DIVERSE BACKTEST SETTINGS THROUGHOUT THE STATE IN URBAN AND RURAL LOCATIONS FROM DESERTS TO MOUNTAINS INLAND VALLEYS TO COAST FRESHWATER AND MARINE CALIFORNIA AGRICULTURE'S PRODUCE FISH SHELLFISH AND SEAWEED FROM MANY DIFFERENT CONSUMERS AND BENEFICIARIES INCLUDING THE DELIBERATE RESTORATION OF SPECIES AND HABITATS. EXCEPT FOR PRODUCERS IN CALIFORNIA FOUND AND CULTIVATED A VARIETY OF SPECIALTY NICHES SHOWING A DEFT ABILITY TO A CHALLENGING LANDSCAPE OF HIGH COSTS AND GLOBAL COMPETITIVE FORCES AND CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ALL THIS IN THE DECADES BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AQUACULTURE PRODUCERS ARE RESILIENT AND OUR FLYING LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE RECENT MARKET AND SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS TO IMPROVE. RETOOL AND RETRAIN FINE TUNE A SAFE AND SECURE OUR SEAFOOD SUPPLY WHILE PROVIDING DIRECT AND ANCILLARY BENEFITS TO ECOSYSTEMS. FISH PROCESSING CAPACITY OF FARM RAISED PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA HAS RECENTLY GROWN. MODESTLY BUT WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE HAS FOUND AN OPPORTUNITY TO EXPAND UNDER CURRENT MARKET CIRCUMSTANCES FAVOURING LOCAL PRODUCT. AMID CURRENT I'M SORRY AMID RECURRING DROUGHT HERE IN THE WEST MARINE AQUACULTURE WHICH USES NEARLY ZERO FRESH WATER TO DELIVER ITS MUCH NEEDED PRODUCTS AND BENEFITS. DEMONSTRATES BOTH CLIMATE RESILIENCE IN THE FACE OF SCARCE FRESHWATER RESOURCES. AS WELL AS VULNERABILITY TO CHANGING OCEAN CONDITIONS AND PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO ADAPT TO THESE CHALLENGES FOR EXAMPLE REGISTERED COMMERCIAL ARJUN RANCHING IS NOW HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA. DRIVING THE REMOVAL OF OVER POPULATED SEA URCHINS FROM DECIMATED KELP BEDS INTO LAND BASED AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS. EMPLOYING A DIRECT ECONOMIC INSTANT INCENTIVES THAT RESTORES KELP HABITAT. OR AT LEAST WE HOPE SO. THE PROCESS ADDS VALUE BY FEEDING HOLLOW ORIGINS TO PRODUCE VALUE WHAT LOONY IN A MATTER OF WEEKS WHILE REMOVING GRAZING PRESSURE SO THE KELP BEDS CAN RECUPERATE. SPEAKING OF KELP SEAWEED FARMING IN CALIFORNIA IS TRANSITIONING FROM ARE INDEED TO COMMERCIAL SCALE WITH INITIAL PERMIT APPROVALS FOR ONE OPERATION IN SANTA BARBARA. AND DEMONSTRATIONS SHOWING PROGRESS FROM HUMBOLDT TO LOS ANGELES TO SAN DIEGO. DELIVERING MORE RESPONSIVE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT AND CUTTING BLUE TAPE WITH A CLEAR AND SIMPLE LICENSING PATHWAY IS WHAT ENABLES PRODUCERS TO INNOVATE ADAPT AND GROW WITH MORE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY. WHILE MAINTAINING THE PUBLIC'S CONFIDENCE IN STATE ENVIRONMENTAL SAFEGUARDS. CALL IT DREW US ALL OCCUR. AND FEDERAL ASSISTANCE HAS HELPED BRIDGE MANY IN THE AQUACULTURE INDUSTRY WHO SUFFERED LOSSES BUT AS WE LOOK AHEAD IN A STRONGER POSITION FOR CALIFORNIA SUPPLY LOCAL SEAFOOD RESILIENT WATERFRONT COMMUNITIES. PROSPERS BLUE ECONOMIES AND HIGH ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS. IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE ENABLE EQUITABLE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY. WHEN PERMITTING PROCESSES AND OBTAINING SOCIAL LICENSE TO OPERATE CREATES STEEP BARRIERS TO ENTRY. HAS THE EFFECT OF SELECTING NOT FOR EQUITY BUT FOR THE FINANCIAL INSURANCE OF ALL OF THE LARGEST AND DEEPEST POCKETED ENTERPRISES. RESPONSIVE ADAPTIVE MANAGEMENT REQUIRES A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF CAPACITY IN TERMS OF STAFF NUMBERS AND EXPERIENCE. AQUACULTURE PROGRAM CAPACITY ON BOTH FRONTS IS CONSTRAINED IN OUR STATE AGENCIES. AND WE HAVE THE OBJECTIVE MEASUREMENTS OR METRICS OF SERVICE BASED BUDGETING THAT CONFIRM THE SHORTFALLS WITHIN VISUAL WHILE I RECEIVE REGULAR CALLS FROM CONSTITUENTS VOICING CONCERNS. ABOUT TIMELY IN RESPONSE TO DELIVERY OF SERVICE TO THE PUBLIC. WE SIMPLY CAN'T BE ACCOMPLISHED AT CURRENT CAPACITY. OUR REPORT TO THE LEGISLATURE SCHEDULED AFTER THE FIRST OF THE YEAR. VITA DISTANT DETAILS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. BUILDING CAPACITY ALSO INCLUDES BUILDING KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE AS WE RELY ON INCREASINGLY SPECIALIZED SKILLS TO DESIGN CONSTRUCT OPERATE AND OVERSEE AQUACULTURE SYSTEMS WITH THEIR LAND OR OCEAN BASED THE CONCEPT OF PROFESSIONAL OR VOCATIONAL CERTIFICATES AND STANDARDS SHOULD HAVE A PLACE IN BUILDING FURTHER CONFIDENCE IN SAFE AND RELIABLE FACILITIES AND THEIR OPERATIONS. I'M PLEASED TO REPORT A GROWING EFFORT TO BUILD EDUCATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AT MULTIPLE LEVELS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. INCLUDING SANTA MONICA AND FEATHER RIVER COLLEGE'S CAMPUS IS A MARINE LABS THROUGHOUT THE CSU AND UC SYSTEMS. USC AN OCCASIONAL AND STEM PROGRAMS SUPPORTED AT MIDDLE AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS THROUGHOUT THE STATE. HOWEVER PEOPLE ARE EMERGING FROM THIS TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT. DESERVE ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY THIRTY SECONDS. TO APPLY THEIR SKILLS TO PROBLEM SOLVING TO BE PRODUCTIVE. FOUR DISTRICTS IN SAN DIEGO AND HUMBLE AND FACILITIES LIKE OUT TO SEA IN LOS ANGELES ARE CONTRIBUTING TO CAPACITY IN OTHER IMPORTANT WAYS BY HOSTING FACILITIES FOR INNOVATION PROVIDING START UP ASSISTANCE THROUGH BUSINESS INCUBATORS. AND HELPING O SECURE PERMITS AND ENTITLEMENTS WHERETHE LIFT IS TOO GREAT FOR SMALLER START UPS. AS WE EMERGE FROM THE CONFINES OF THE PANDEMIC WE'RE FORTUNATE THAT AQUACULTURE AMERICA WHICH IS THE NATIONAL GATHERING OF WORLDWIDE. EXPERTS IN AQUACULTURE IS TAKING PLACE FIRST WEEK OF MARCH IN SAN DIEGO. PROVIDES A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY TO LEARN FROM AND PARTICIPATE IN TECHNICAL AND POLICY DISCUSSIONS FOR EXHIBITIONS. AND MEETINGS COVERING THE BREADTH OF AQUACULTURE TOPICS AND AN OPTION TO TOUR THE DEPARTMENT'S PARTNER. IN THE OCEAN RESOURCE ENHANCEMENT AND HATCHERY PROGRAM JUST HUBBS SEAWORLD RESEARCH INSTITUTE. THEY HAVE AND CONTINUE TO PIONEER THE CULTIVATION OF WHITE SEA BASS IN A VARIETY OF OTHER MARINES SPECIES IMPORTANT TO SPORT AND COMMERCIAL FISHERIES. PASSAGE BY THE WAY A REPEAT HE B. NINETEEN FORTY NINE AND A HALF OF THAT PROGRAM LAST YEAR IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. AS IS THE INFUSION OF SUPPORT IN THIS YEAR'S BUDGET FOR ALL TO SEE AS IT DEVELOPS BIRTH FIFTY EIGHT INTO A CENTER FOR INNOVATION. FOR OCEAN BASED BUSINESSES SPECIALIZING IN SUSTAINABLE AQUACULTURE. OFFSHORE RENEWABLE ENERGY AN UNDERWATER ROBOTICS AS WELL AS SUPPORT FOR EDUCATIONAL AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES. THESE ARE ALL GREAT STARTS BUILDING CAPACITY FOR AQUACULTURE IN CALIFORNIA. ON BEHALF OF SOME. THANK YOU. ON BEHALF OF MANY MORE. IT'S A START. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER LEVEL WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR WORK SIR- WORKING NET SO MUCH GENERALLY SHE'S AQUACULTURE FOR HIS CAREER VERY GRATEFUL SIR IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. ALL RIGHT THE GERMAN WE'RE NOT TO HEAR. FROM A DEER IN ROW CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON SALMON AND STEELHEAD TROUT HERE AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE TODAY I'M SORRY THAT WE CAN'T BE IN PERSON. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR ALL OF YOUR WORK- PROVIDE AN- UPDATE ON BEHALF. OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES IT'LL GIVE YOU THIRTY SECONDS. HEADS UP. THANK YOU SENATOR MCGUIRE GOOD AFTERNOON AND- TO YOU AND. I THINK THE COMMITTEE MEETINGS IN PERSON YOU CONDUCT SUCH A WONDERFUL MEETING- I WISH I COULD BE THERE TODAY BUT- IT IS AN HONOR FOR ME TO REPRESENT THE CALIFORNIA ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON SALMON AND STEELHEAD AS OUR CHAIRMAN- AS YOU SAID MY NAME IS DARREN MURRAY ON THE NORTH COAST DIRECTOR FOR CALIFORNIA TRIAL.% IN THE CURRENT CHAIR OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE. I WANT TO START A COUPLE POSITIVE NOTES I WANT TO START BY THANKING THE SENATOR IN THIS COMMITTEE. ON BEHALF OF THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE FOR WORKING SO HARD. TO PRIORITIZE FUNDING FOR NATURAL RESOURCE PROTECTION IN CALIFORNIA'S BUDGET. IT'S DEFINITELY ENCOURAGING TO US THAT THE WORK WE DO TO PROTECT SALMON STILL HAD IN THE STATE. IS AMONG THE STATE'S NATURAL RESOURCE PRIORITIES- THAT FUNDING COMING FORWARD IS GOING TO BE CRITICAL TO SAVING THESE IMPERILED FISH POPULATIONS- I ALSO WANT TO COMPLIMENT THE STATE'S EFFORTS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. AND IT'S CUTTING THE GREEN TAPE EFFORT. FROM SECRETARY CROWFOOT AND DEPUTY SECRETARY DR JENNIFER NORRIS AT THE RESOURCES AGENCY. DR BONHAM AND HIS STAFF. IN THE STATE WATER BOARD WHO HAVE DEVELOPED A REALLY IMPORTANT TOOL WITH A STATEWIDE RESTORATION GENERAL ORDER- THIS COMING FORWARD THIS COMING YEAR- THIS IS A GAME CHANGER FOR MUCH OF THE RATE RESTORATION WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. AND I JUST WANT TO COMPLIMENT THAT WORK. ON BEHALF OF THE COMMITTEE THERE ARE TWO MAIN ITEMS I WANT TO BRING TO YOUR ATTENTION TODAY. NAMELY DROUGHT PLANNING. AND. THE CALIFORNIA MONITORING PROGRAM. OUR ADVISORY CAN ON DRY AT OUR LAW. MEETING AND WE HAVE SIX MAIN COMMENTS I WANT TO BRING FORWARD TO YOUR ATTENTION. FIRST OF ALL WE DON'T HAVE INSTREAM FLOW REQUIREMENTS IN MOST RIVERS IN CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY ARE UNREGULATED COASTAL RIVERS. DESPITE THE CALIFORNIA WATER ACTION PLAN PRIORITIZING JUST FIVE RIVERS. FOR DEVELOPMENT OF SLOW STUDIES IN TWENTY FOURTEEN. WE HAVE STILL NOT RECEIVED FULL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THOSE FIVE RIVERS. SECOND OF ALL WE NEED TO HAVE OUR STATE AGENCIES PREPARED ON AN ONGOING BASIS TO RESPOND TO DROUGHT. WE CANNOT WAIT TILL WE'RE IN THE MIDST OF THE NEXT OUGHT TO DECIDE TO TAKE ACTION. AND THEN HOW TO IDENTIFY YET AGAIN WHAT ACTIONS MIGHT BE TAKEN. WITH OUR CURRENT FUTURE CLIMATE BECOMING DRIER WE NEED TO HAVE ROBUST DROUGHT MANAGEMENT PLANS IN PLACE. AND READY AS A CRANIAL ACTIVITY. THIS IN TURN WILL LIKELY ENTAIL THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL STAFF AVAILABLE TO THOSE RESPONSIBLE AGENCIES. SO THAT THOSE STEPHANOPOULOS SIX TEMPORARILY. ASSIGNED TO DEAL WITH THE ONGOING DROUGHT CRISIS AND THEN DISAPPEAR BACK TO THOSE OTHER PROGRAMS ONCE THE FIRST RAINS ARRIVE. WE NEED PERMANENT. STAFF DEDICATED TO DROUGHT PLANNING. WE NEED MORE RESEARCH. FROM OUR PERMITTING AGENCIES FOR SECURING WATER RIGHT APPROVALS FOR DROUGHT RESILIENCE PROJECTS. WATER USERS HAVE AMPLE OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE OPERATIONS MORE DROUGHT RESILIENT BY CHANGING THE SEASON OF DIVERSION. CREATING OFF CHANNEL STORAGE ADOPTING CONJUNCTIVE USE OF GROUNDWATER AND MANY OTHER MECHANISMS FOR PROTECTING STREAM FLOW AND INCREASING WATER SECURITY. BUT THESE PROJECTS TAKE TOO LONG TO GET APPROVED AND THIS NEEDS TO CHANGE. OUR OTHER EXISTING RERESENTATIVES TODAY HAVE ALREADY SUGGESTED CONTINUE TRACKING OF HATCHERY FISH TO MORE WESTERN RELEASE OINTS IN THE SAN FRANCISCO BAY INSTEAD OF SAN PABLO. AND OUR ADVISORY COMMITTEE SUPPORTS THAT ACTION AS WELL. AND LAST WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE OUR STATE AGENCIES REESTABLISHED BAY DELTA WATER QUALITY AND FLOW REQUIREMENTS THIS WAS DISCUSSED EARLIER IN OUR BUDGET SHE SUPPORTS THAT AS WELL AS SUPPORT STRONG PROTECTIVE MEASURES. FOR SALMON WHILE THE NEW DELTA BIOLOGICAL OPINION IS BEING WRITTEN. REGARDING THE CALIFORNIA MONITORING PROGRAM- YOU'RE LIKELY AWARE I'VE DISCUSSED THIS PROGRAM WITH THE TOO MANY IN THE PAST AND YOU STILL HAVE NOT SEEN PROGRESS IN FUNDING. TO ALLOW THIS PROGRAM TO SERVE ITS PURPOSE WE RELY ON THIS MONITORING PROGRAM STATEWIDE TO INFORM OUR RESTORATION EFFORTS SPOKE FOR HABITAT AND WATERSHED RESTORATION. WHICH ARE NOW SPENDING TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TAX DOLLARS ANNUALLY IN THISEFFORT WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION WE DO NOT KNOW IF THIS INVESTMENT IN PUBLIC FUNDS. IS BEING AFFECTED. IN ADDITION OUR STATE STREET STATE AND FEDERAL FISHERY AGENCY PARTNERS RELY ON THIS INFORMATION EXTENSIVELY FOR POPULATION STATUS UPDATES. FOR THEIR ENDANGERED SPECIES RECOVERY TRACKING. AND THESE PROGRAMS PROVIDE EXCELLENT JOBS AND TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF FISHERIES AND WATER SHOULD SCIENTISTS. YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK FOR THE WATERSHED STORAGE PROGRAM FOR EXAMPLE IT'S A GREAT TRAINING PROGRAMS FOR THOSE FOLKS. THIS YEAR THERE WAS A CONCERTED EFFORT BY SEVERAL CONSERVATION GROUPS INCLUDING SEVERAL OF OUR ADVISORY COMMITTEE MEMBERS. TO PROVIDE FUNDING FROM THE STATE BUDGET TO SEE IF W. YOUR MARKER STAMINA STILL LIKE POPULATION MONITORING. AS YOU'RE LIKELY AWARE THIS FUNDING WAS ABSORBED INTO GENERAL FUNDS FOR THOSE AGENCIES TO PROVIDE. PROVIDED TO THE DEPARTMENT AND NOW IT LOOKS AS THOUGH THOSE FUNDS WILL NOT BE GOING TOWARD THEIR INTENDED TARGET OF MONITORING PROGRAM. OUR MOST RECENT ADVISOR INCISOR COMMITTEE MEETING THE DEPARTMENT STAFF INFORMED OUR COMMITTEE THAT. OUT OF TWENTY SIX PROGRAMS STATEWIDE FOR WHICH BOTH STATE AND FEDERAL FISHERIES AGENCIES ARE PRIORITIZED ONLY TEN OF THOSE PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY FUNDED. AND THIS CALENDAR YEAR TWENTY TWENTY ONE AN ADDITIONAL SIX PROGRAMS WILL HAVE LOST OUR FUNDING AND BE SHUT DOWN. THESE ARE ALL PROGRAMS THAT HAVE LONG TERM DATASETS ON POPULATION ABUNDANCE AND THEY WILL BE DISCONTINUED THIS YEAR. FINALLY OF THE TOTAL PROGRAM NEED ABOUT FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS WHICH WE ESTIMATE ONLY ABOUT TWO MILLION IS BEING MADE AVAILABLE FROM THE COASTAL MONITORING PROGRAMS AND ALL OF THAT IS FROM FEDERAL FUNDS. FROM THE PCS ARE PROGRAM IN CLOSING WE NEED OUR STATE FISHERIES AGENCIES TO PRIORITIZE THIS PROGRAMMING WE NEED JUST NEEDS HELP TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FUNDING TO DO THIS WORK. I THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. HEARING THE PLEASURES. OURS THANK YOU SO MUCH TERENCE CAN BE HANGING WITH US HERE FOR A BIT AND WE'RE GOING TO GET ANY QUESTIONS DURING THANK YOU FOR YOUR ADVOCACY YOUR HARD WORK SIR EACH AND EVERY YEAR AND WE'RE THRILLED THAT YOU'RE WITH US TODAY. WE'RE VERY VERY GRATEFUL THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HEAR FROM THESE WHITE MEN- AT LEAST DOES A FANTASTIC JOB EVERY TIME SHE IS IN FRONT OF KIM AT THE COMMITTEE. SHE OF COURSE IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN SIGN STRESSED THIS WOMAN IS SO WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU AGAIN SORRY THAT WE COULD NOT BE IN PERSON. THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. THANK YOU SO MUCH M. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS DR LIZ WISEMAN AND I SERVE AS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA OCEAN SCIENCE STRESSED. I HAD TO APPRECIATE THE REMOTE. PATIENT AS I JOIN YOU TODAY LATE IN THE EVENING AND LONDON- A QUICK REMINDER. ABOUT AS CALIFORNIA OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST IS A NON PROFIT ORGANIZATION DEDICATED TO CONVENING SCIENCE EXPERTISE. TO ACCELERATE PROGRESS TOWARDS THE HEALTHY EQUITABLE AND PRODUCTIVE CAUSED AN OCEAN. WE WERE CREATED BY THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE TO BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN CUTTING EDGE SCIENCE AND CALIFORNIA'S UNIVERSITIES AND SCIENCE INSTITUTIONS. AND FOUNDATION POLICY AND MANAGEMENT. SO I HAVE TO UPDATE FOR YOU TODAY. FIRST WE'RE REQUIRED BY THAT STATE FUNDING LEGISLATION TO REPORT ANNUALLY TO THE LEGISLATURE AND TO THIS JOINT COMMITTEE. TODAY I'M- PLEASED TO FORMALLY PRESENT ON TWENTY TWENTY AND YOUR RECORD. AND SHARE A COUPLE. OF HIGHLIGHTS FROM FROM THAT. SO PULLING OUT TO COUPLE OF HIGH THAT MAYBE OF PARTICULAR INTEREST IN THIS VENUE- AND ALSO BUILDING ON AN APPRECIATING OUR COLLABORATIONS WITH OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL THAT DOCTOR MARK GOLDRING FRIENDS EARLIER. TODAY DELIVERED A SCIENCE BASED ROADMAPS TRACTION ON MICROPLASTICS AND MARINE PROTECTED AREAS. THE BUILDING ON THAT THE THINGS THAT I WANTED TO FOCUS ON HERE IS TO START WITH A COMMENT THAT MUCH FUNDING FOR BASIC SCIENCE RESEARCH CREATES COMPETITION BETWEEN CAMPUSES AND RESEARCHERS. IT DOESN'T- ALWAYS WORKING IN IN THE INTERESTS OF PRIORITY STATES- QUESTIONS- SO WE TAKE PRIDE IN OUR APPROACH TO BUILD NEW COLLABORATIONS ACROSS DISCIPLINES NATURAL AND SOCIAL SCIENCES. FORGE NEW PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN RESEARCHERS AT DIFFERENT UNIVERSITIES. AND ORIENT TO ADDRESSING PARTY QUESTIONS TO THE STATE. LAST YEAR WE WERE- REALLY THRILLED TO BE ABLE TO SUPPORT GROUPS OF RESEARCHERS TO BE ABLE TO OBTAIN ONE MILLION DOLLARS OVER A MILLION DOLLARS IN NEW RESEARCH FUNDING FROM CENTRAL AND STILL. IN TRAFFIC- SUNDAY AS- FOR EXAMPLE LAUNCHED NEW ROOF FROM AND- WITH THE ECONOMISTS AT UC DAVIS TO EXPLORE HOW FLEXIBLE FISHING TOURNAMENTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF MANAGEMENT COULD OR- COULD NOT BE DESIGNED IN A WAY THAT HELPS FISHING COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA ADOPTED CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS. AND HERE WERE REALLY TRYING TO PAY ATTENTION TO NOT ONLY HOUSES POPULATIONS ARE PREDICTED TO CHANGE AND MOVE BUT ALSO GOOD TO THE SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC GOVERNANCE AND MANAGEMENT APPROACHES. WE'VE HEARD A LOT TODAY IN THE CONTEXT OF DUNGEON S. CRAB ABOUT- HOW UNCERTAINTY CREATES A- N. AND RECURRING IMPACTS CREATE A NEED FOR NIMBLENESS AND FAST RESPONSE ANSWERED THIS RESEARCH IS ATTEMPTING TO LAY OUT SOME SCENARIOS- BY WAY THAT WE COULD ACHIEVE THAT. THE CALIFORNIA FISHING COMMUNITIES. WE ALSO SUPPORTED A COALITION OF RESEARCHERS FROM UC DAVIS SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY IN ARKANSAS STATE UNIVERSITY TO OBTAIN HOUSTON RESEARCH FUNDING FROM THE NOW- OCEAN ACIDIFICATION PROGRAM. THIS RESEARCH WHICH IS ON THE WAY NOW- AIMS TO UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL RESILIENCE- SUCCESSFACTORS AMONG COASTAL SHELLFISH GROWERS. IN THE FACE OF CHANGING OCEAN CHEMISTRY ON ON THE WEST COAST SO I LOOK FORWARD TO COMING BACK TO BE ABLE TO SHOW RESULTS- FROM THIS I WOULD I THINK I WAS REALLY POLICY SALIENCE- RESEARCH- WITH YOU NEXT YEAR. SO MY UP TO IS JUST PROGRESS FROM THE- YEAR OF OUR NEW SCIENCE SERVICES PROGRAM DIRECTOR CALIFORNIA LAWMAKERS. COMPLIMENTING OUR DECADE OF EXPERIENCE IN WORKING WITH PARTNERS IN THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH TO PROTECTION COUNSELED- EFFICIENT WILDLIFE AND MANY OF THOSE. THIS PROGRAM IS CREATED TO FULLY LIVE UP TO THE ASPIRATIONS OF COMPOUNDING LEGISLATION AND BRINGS SCIENCE KNOWLEDGE SOLUTIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS. DIRECTLY TO THE LEGISLATURE TO SUPPORT YOUR DECISION MAKING. WE CATALYZE THE LAUNCH OF THIS PROGRAM IN JANUARY WITH DEEP SUPPORT FROM THE WILLIAM AND FLORA HEWLETT FOUNDATION AN ADDITIONAL PRIVATE AND FOUNDATION DONORS. TODAY WE HAVE HOSTED VIRTUAL SCIENCE BRIEFINGS ON KELP FOREST RESTORATION OFFSHORE WIND ENERGY DEVELOPMENTS IN THE. RECENT HUNTINGTON OIL SPILL. A BRIEFING ARE THE MOST POP UP AND I DESIGN TO OFFER AN OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR MEMBERS AND COMMITTEE STOCKS. FROM THE LEGISLATION TO ENGAGE DIRECTLY WITH SCIENCE EXPERTS- AND I'M ASKING QUESTIONS WITH THRILLED THAT THE BRIEFINGS HELD TO DATE HAVE HAD OVER A HUNDRED ATTENDEES WITH STRONG LEGISLATIVE STOCKING ENGAGEMENTS. AND I'VE SENT APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER EMBARRASSED TO CHI. CHU AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF TEACHING ARTISTS FOR HOSTING THE EVENTS THAT WE HAVE TODAY. I LOOK FORWARD TO ENGAGING THIS COMMITTEE- FURTHER AND THE STOCKS I AM IN IN FUTURE EVENTS AND CONVERSATIONS. AND JUST CLOSE BY SAYING THAT WE'RE ALSO GRATEFUL FOR THE TIME AND ENGAGEMENT WITH OXIME BY OKAY I THINK WE'RE FORTY AND COUNTING COMMITTEE AND MEMBER STOCKS- OVER THE PAST MONTHS IT'S BEEN A REAL PRIVILEGE TO CONNECT STOCKS TO SCIENCE EXPERIMENTS ON THE GROUND IN CALIFORNIA. AND PROVIDES TECHNICAL FEEDBACK ON ON BILL IDEAS AMONG AMONG OTHER CONVERSATIONS WE'RE REALLY COMMITTED TO STRENGTHENING THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND DEEPENING OUR UNDERSTANDING IS COSTA NOTION INTERESTS AND PRIORITIES- IN THE LEGISLATURE SO THAT WE CAN EFFECTIVELY SUPPORT IN THE UPCOMING TWENTY TWENTY TWO- SESSION. WITH USEFUL SCIENCE SOLUTIONS AND ADVICE AND WITH THAT THANK YOU SO MUCH AGAIN. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING EXECUTOR WORKING THE NIGHT SHIFT TONIGHT FROM LONDON OF ALL PLACES MY GOODNESS WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL THAT YOU'RE HERE WITH US. I'M GONNA START WITH A FEW QUESTIONS- IN MISS WHITE MEN SO- YOU'VE BEEN DOING SO MUCH WORK ON- I'M BEARING LARGE LEGACY PROJECTS ACROSS THE STATE. I'D LIKE TO BE TO GET INTO SALMON- AND REALLY HOW DO YOU SEE YOUR ROLE OR DO YOU THINK YOU COULD GET POTENTIALLY MORE INVOLVED. IN BRIDGING THAT OCEAN FRESH WATER GAP IS LOOK THIS SPECIES IS ON THE BRINK. AND ESPECIALLY IN THE SACRAMENT A WATERSHED RIGHT I MEAN THERE IS A HIGH LIKELIHOOD THAT OVER THE NEXT DECADE THAT WE MAY SEE A TOTAL EXTINCTION- NOT THERE YET BUT A HIGH LIKELIHOOD YOUR THOUGHTS ON THIS. KNOWING HOW BUSY YOU ARE AND SO. MANY DIFFERENT SUBJECTS FOR THAT TO BE TO GET YOUR TAKE. YEAH THE QUEST- AND IT'S THAT I MAY TIME WE- WE'VE GOT BEEN CONVERSATION. WITH NOW I AND- AT THE TWO CONSULTANTS- FOR THE COMMITTEE. AND OTHERS SAID THAT UC SANTA CRUZ ABOUT THE POTENTIAL OF ENGAGING MORE ON THIS AND WHILE SUPPORTING. AND GRADUATE STUDENTS- AT UC SANTA CRUZ WHO HAS DEEP INTEREST IN THIS ISSUE. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE ARE INTERESTED IN PURSUING I THINK THAT THE NEXUS THAT I SEE WITH WITHOUT WORK IS TWO FOLD ONE IS WITH THAT- FLEXIBLE ALERT FLEXIBLE IS A CHALLENGING WHERE IT THAT THIS SORT OF. NIMBLE ADAPTIVE CHANGING MANAGEMENT REGIMES GETTING REALLY CREATIVE AND THINKING ABOUT SALMON FISHERY MANAGEMENT APPROACHES AND IN THE STATES. AND NOT DOING SO IN ISOLATION FROM FROM AND THEN TO THE OCEANS OF SPECIES SO. LIKE LIKE SALMON. AND ALSO CONNECTING TO OUR NEW WEBSITE SERVICES PROGRAM WHERE I HOPE THAT WE CAN- BIEN A MECHANISM TO FOSTER BRINGING SOME OF THE NEW CUTTING EDGE- SCIENCE RESEARCH ON RESTORATION TECHNIQUES- TWO DIFFERENT AUDIENCES AND VENUES AND IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S CERTAINLY A TOPIC THAT I WOULD BE WILLING TO AND OPEN AND EXCITED TO DISCUSS ALONG WITH YOU. WE LOOK FORWARD TO THAT CONVERSATION THANK YOU SO MUCH AS WELL AND AGAIN WE REALLY DO APPRECIATE. YOU BEING WITH US AND ESPECIALLY AFTER HOURS THANK YOU SO MUCH I WANNA GO BACK OVER TO DARING. WITH THE ADVISORY COMMITTEE ON SALMON STEELHEAD TROUT. IN THERE AND IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE IN A FIRE DRILL EVERY YEAR WHEN- A DROUGHT HITS YOU TALKED ABOUT. ADVANCE PLANNING ARE YOU FEELING THAT THERE IS ANY CHANGE. IN WHAT THE STATE'S DOING WITH FOR EXAMPLE THE INVESTMENT THAT WE'RE LOOKING AT THAT FIFTEEN BILLION. IT'S A LARGER PACKAGE ON CLIMATE. AND CLIMATE ACTION BUT ALSO ON DROUGHT BUT ARE YOU FEELING THAT. WE SOUGHT TO PICK UP THE GAME ONE IT COMES TO TERM AND- FOR WHAT A MORE AREA. BECAUSE WILL LOOK IN THE STATE. THAT'S REALLY A QUESTION YOU KNOW THERE'S NO DOUBT THAT- SOME OF THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO BE MADE AVAILABLE TO OTHER AGENCIES TO INCREASE OUR STAFF AND THAT'S THAT'S A NUMBER. YOU KNOW THE NUMBER ONE FIRST STEP THAT NEEDS TO BE BAD- WE'RE WE'RE I THINK YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT SOME OF OUR GROUPS ARE GOING TO BE COMING TO YOUR STAFF AND YOURSELF TO DISCUSS LEGISLATION THAT MIGHT PUT IN PLACE SOME REQUIREMENTS TO HAVE THESE ACTIONS TAKE PLACE. WE CERTAINLY THINK THAT- THIRD THIRTY THREE MORE DONE THAN THERE IS NOW- THE FUNDING THAT'S COMING FORWARD IS CERTAINLY GOING TO HELP- OUT ON THE GROUND AND IN THOSE AGENCIES. YEAH BUT WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO PUT THIS INTO PLACE RIGHT WITH POLICY SO I THINK THAT'S THE OTHER REALLY IMPORTANT ITEM. WHEN IT COMES TO INDEBTEDNESS SO IT BECOMES PART OF THE CULTURE RIGHT. WHEN IT COMES WITH CLIMATE CHANGE AND WHAT OUR FUTURE LOOKS LIKE IN THE STATE DURING THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'D LIKE TO GO QUICKLY. TO MR LEVEL SO LOOK IT WE'VE HAD A LOT OF KIND OF A CONVERSATION JUST A LEVEL ABOUT AQUACULTURE- ANI AND HOW WE CAN BE ABLE TO BECOME. A HOME HERE ON THE WEST COAST FOR THIS. BUT THE LEVEL THERE ALWAYS SEEMS TO BE A BIT OF A STUMBLING BLOCK SO IF YOU DON'T MIND TALK ABOUT WHAT DO YOU SEE THOSE% BOTTLENECKS TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE SUSTAINABLE GROWTH HERE IN THE YEARS TO COME- IT PROBABLY WOULD TAKE TIME TO PROVIDE GOOD ANSWERS BUT I THINK THAT- WHEN I TOUCHED ON CAPACITY THAT'S A THAT'S A CRITICAL THING- WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO RESPOND TO REQUESTS FOR- RESPOND TO REQUESTS TO EVALUATE NEW PROJECTS- WE HAVE. SOME VERY IMPORTANT RESPONSIBILITIES. TO MAINTAIN SAFEGUARDS ALSO HAVE RESPONSIBILITIES TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL DEVELOPMENT AND THAT'S A FINE BALANCE THAT- WE TAKE QUITE SERIOUSLY SO HAVING THE CAPACITY TO- THOROUGHLY ANALYZE THOSE THINGS THIS IS A BIG DEAL- I DON'T THINK ANYBODY'S. I'M LOOKING AT- CUTTING CORNERS OR STREAMLINING PROCESS SEES WE JUST NEED TO HAVE THE CAPACITY TO FULLY. YEAH WE HAVE A VERY COMPETITIVE- LAND USE COAST THERE'S A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS GOING ON SOME. THE FEDERAL FEDERAL EFFORT TO IDENTIFY AQUACULTURE OPPORTUNITY AREAS WAS- IT IS COMING OUT WITH AN ATLAS LATER THIS MONTH AND- HEARING WHAT THEY'VE GONE THROUGH TO FIGURE OUT SPATIAL PLANNING WITH ALL THE DIFFERENT CONSIDERATIONS SHOWS JUST HOW CHALLENGING IT IS SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE. TACKLED AND I THINK THAT THE OBCS ACTION PLAN WILL BE QUITE HELPFUL IN IN PROVIDING A FRAMEWORK IN AND STRUCTURE FOR HOW WE FILL IN THE GAPS AND I EXPECT THAT WILL BE- HAVING RECOMMENDATIONS THAT COME TO THE FOREFRONT AS THAT ACTION PLAN. GETS FINALIZED IN THE IN THE FOLLOWING YEAR IT'S A LEVEL THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THAT AND I KNOW I PUT YOU PUT ON THE SPOT IN HAD A LIMITED TIME SO VERY VERY GRATEFUL AGAIN FOR YOUR WORK THAT'S RANDY LEVEL AQUACULTURE COORDINATOR FOR THE COPPER DEPARTMENT OFFICIAL WHILE I FEEL I SAY THANK YOU TO MR LEVEL OF COURSE. TO MISS WHITE MEN WHOSE DEMON IN TODAY FROM THE GREAT CITY OF LONDON IS WHITE MEN THANK YOU SO MUCH WERE REALLY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR HARD WORK HE'S THE- EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE OCEAN SCIENCE TRUST OF COURSE YOU WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA VISOR COMMITTEE AND- SALMON STEELHEAD TROUT DERREN SO GOOD TO SEE YOU SIR THANK YOU SO MUCH WE WANT TO SAY. THANK YOU TO OUR SHOWS WELL SHE HELPS LEAD THE CALIFORNIA DUNGENESS CRAB TASK FORCE THOSE WHO WERE OUR FISHERY COMEDIAN AQUACULTURE PROGRAM REPORTS IN LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE ARE NOW TO BE MOVING ON TO OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY. AFTER THIS PANEL WE'RE GONNA BE TAKING PUBLIC COMMENT WE LOOK FORWARD TO HEARING FROM YOU WE WANT TO REMIND YOU THAT THERE IS A TOLL FREE NUMBER THAT WE'RE GONNA INVITE YOU TO CALL INTO HERE TODAY. THAT NUMBER IS. 844-291-6364 AGAIN AFTER THIS UPCOMING PANEL FOCUSING ON STRATEGIES TO KEEP CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES THRIVING WE'RE GOING TO INVITE YOU TO CALL OUR TOLL FREE NUMBER WE WELCOME YOUR PARTICIPATION EIGHT FOUR FOUR TWO NINE ONE. SIX THREE EIGHT SIX FOUR AND JUST DIAL US UP RIGHT THERE ON THE NUMBER ON THE SCREEN WE LOOK FOR TO TALKING WITH YOU HERE IN JUST A BIT ALRIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN WE'VE SAVED THE BEST FOR LAST WE ARE- IT CAN BE WITH OUR FINAL PANEL OF THE DAY. AND IT'S GOING TO UPDATE US ON THE- COMMITTEE ON STRATEGIES TO REALLY KEEP CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES DRIVING IF I COULD BE CANDID. WE NEED A THRIVING FISHERY WHETHER IT'S SALMON ROCKFISH SQUID CRAB SPINY LOBSTER OYSTER I HAD TO BE ABLE TO KEEP SO MANY IN PARTICULAR RURAL COMMUNITIES THRIVING IT'S ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO THE FUTURE OF THE STATE IN THE FUTURE OF RURAL. COASTAL CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE COMPILED OF WONDER. ALL STAR PAIN. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE. CONVERSATION STRATEGIES TO KEEP CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES THRIVING WE KNOW IF SALMON CAN THRIVE IN THIS STATE. COASTAL COMMUNITIES WILL THRIVE. DOING THE RIGHT THING FOR THE ENVIRONMENT BENEFITS OUR ECONOMIC INTERESTS AS WELL. SO LET'S GET THIS. ALL STAR PANEL COULD DROP AND WHO BETTER. TO START US OFF WITH- THIS PANEL IS COREY RIGHT AND- SHE IS DEFICIENT CONSERVATION PROGRAM MANAGER FOR. OCEAN CONSERVANCY. BUT SHE'S GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT. US AND I'M TEACHING PRICE UPDATE ON STATE AND FEDERAL INITIATIVES TO ADDRESS. THE COMMUNITY IN CLIMATE RESILIENCY IN OUR FISHERIES. HIS WRITINGS IT IS SO GOOD TO SEE YOU WELCOME TO COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND- WE'RE REALLY EXCITED TO BE ABLE TO HEAR. YOUR BRIEFING HERE TODAY I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. GOOD AFTERNOON. AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU SO MUCH. MISTER CHAIR IN MR GRAY CELL- MY NAME'S COREY WRITINGS I WORK FOR OCEAN CONSERVANCY I'M A CALIFORNIA NUMBER AT THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. AND I'M A DOCTORAL STUDENT IN THE LAB OF DR PHILIP LEVIN AT THE UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON- TODAY MY AFFILIATIONS ARE FOR IDENTIFICATION PURPOSES ONLY AND I AM SPEAKING INSURING IT CAN. OPINIONS ON BEHALF OF MYSELF ONLY. AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENGAGE WITH YOU TODAY. CLIMATE CHANGE IS HAVING MULTI FACETED IMPACTS ON OUR OCEAN ECOSYSTEM OUR FISH POPULATIONS. ARE FISHING IN COASTAL COMMUNITIES. THERE IS NO SINGLE SOLUTION TO PREPARE A FISHERIES DATA COMPLEX NATURE OF CLIMATE CHANGE. AND HOW WE ARE SEEN IT IMPACTS ALL CALIFORNIANS IN MULTIPLE OVERLAPPING WAYS. BUT THERE ARE SOME ACTIONS WE CAN AKE THAT WILL SUPPORT A HEALTHY OCEAN AND FISHING COMMUNITIES. FIRSTLY AND FOREMOST WE MUST RECOMMIT TO SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT. PORTENTS OF THE RAIN LIKE MANAGEMENT ACT AND NATIONAL LAW MANDATES THAT WE USE THE BEST SCIENTIFIC INFORMATION AVAILABLE AND THAT WE DON'T OVER FISH. KEEPING FOR STARTS HEALTHY IS CENTRAL TO ADDRESSING CLIMATE CHANGE. NO OTHER MANAGEMENT OR CONSERVATION APPROACHES OR TOOLS OR SHINY PRETTY TECH SOLUTION WILL SUSTAIN A HEALTHY OCEAN AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES IF WE DON'T HAVE HEALTHY FISH STOCKS. WE CAN'T HACK OUR WAY OUT OF OVERFISHED STOCKS AND WE CAN'T A. I. R. FISHING COMMUNITIES KNOCK ONS ARE GONE. TO THAT END WE NEED TIMELY COMPLETE AND ACCURATE DATA THAT IS INTEGRATED INTO AND USED APPROPRIATELY IN MANAGEMENT. AS A COUNCIL MEMBER I SEE THE DIRECT IMPACT OF MANAGEMENT THAT LACKS THE NEEDED DATA. AND AS MR CLASS EARLIER WE LIVE AND DIE BY THE BEST AVAILABLE SCIENCE. TO BE CLEAR I'M NOT SEEING THE MOUNTAINS MORE OF DATA WHAT I'M SAYING IS THAT WITH CLIMATE CHANGE ALTERING OR OCEAN FISHERIES WE NEED TO BE MORE STRATEGIC AND SCIENTIFIC. ABOUT WHAT DATA WE'RE COLLECTING AND HOW WE DO IT. FOR EXAMPLE FISH YOUR BONES WHICH ARE CRITICAL FOR UNDERSTANDING FISH POPULATION LEVELS. CURRENTLY WE RELY HEAVILY ON VOLUNTARILY COLLECTIONS CARCASS SAMPLING FINE FISH AND OTHER OPPORTUNISTIC COLLECTION. IT CAN MARKET SHORT TERM FIXES A COLLECTION PROGRAMS FOR BIOLOGICAL INFORMATION LIKE YOUR BONES NEED TO BE DESIGNED BASED STRATIFIED AND SCIENTIFICALLY RANDOM TO PROVIDE THE DATA WE NEED FOR ROBUST STOCK ASSESSMENT AND MANAGEMENT. IT'S ALSO ESSENTIAL THAT WE BREAK DOWN ANY REMAINING BARRIERS THE DATA FLOWING FROM BRUSSELS TO MANAGERS. ESTABLISH HER CAR WAS CONTROL RULES THAT APPLY THESE DATA TO ENSURE THAT MANAGEMENT TARGETS ARE MET ON AN ONGOING BASIS. TO GET THERE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE NEEDS THE RESOURCES AND THE CAPACITY TO DO THEIR WORK AS PART OF THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN GREAT PEOPLE. AS WE NOW KNOW FROM THE SERVICE BASED BUDGET PROCESS AT THE LEGISLATURE INITIATED THROUGH MULTIPLE BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS AND THAT THE DEPARTMENT EMBRACED. THE DEPARTMENT REMAINS UNDERFUNDED ACROSS THE BOARD. AND IN PARTICULAR FOR SPECIES AND HABITAT CONSERVATION AND PUBLIC USE AND ENJOYMENT. WITH SERVICE LEVELS AND A THIRD OR LESS OF WHAT WOULD BE NEEDED FOR THE DEPARTMENT TO MEET ITS MISSION. THIS YEAR'S STATE BUDGET MADE IMPORTANT NEW SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS HOWEVER IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE STATE NOT FEDERAL MANDATES FOR SCIENCE BASED MANAGEMENT. SIGNIFICANTLY MORE TARGETED INVESTMENT WILL BE NEEDED. IT IS ALSO IMPERATIVE THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUED TO DEDICATE ITS LIMITED STAFF RESOURCES TO ENGAGE IN FEDERAL FISHERY MANAGEMENT FORMSSUCH AS THE COUNCIL. IS THROUGH THE COUNCIL AND OTHER REGIONAL EFFORTS AND WE CAN WORK TOGETHER WITH OUR FEDERAL AND WEST COAST PARTNERS TO STRENGTHEN OUR FISHERIES AND COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE ECOSYSTEM LEVELS. FISH WHALES AND SEABIRDS DON'T RECOGNIZE STATE BOUNDARIES AND WE SHOULD CONTINUALLY MOVING TOWARDS THE SAME ECOSYSTEM BASED MANAGEMENT APPROACH REQUIRED BY CALIFORNIA LAW UNDER FISHING GAME CODE SECTION SEVEN OF THREE POINT THREE. WE ALSO NEED TO ENGAGE MORE INTENTIONALLY TO ENSURE JUSTICE AND EQUITY AND FISHERIES AND FISHERIES DECISION MAKING. SUCH ENGAGEMENT IS A NECESSARY STEP IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT REPRESENTING THE VALUES OF OUR STATE AND SHIPPING LONG TERM SUSTAINABILITY OF OUR OCEAN AND FISHERY. STATE MANAGEMENT MOST OF ALL IF YOU ARE FISHERIES OF THE COMPLEX AND DYNAMIC HUMAN SYSTEMS THEY ARE. FOR EXAMPLE WE HAVE MORE LATINO ASIAN AMERICAN AND BLACK FISHERMAN THAN EVER BEFORE HOWEVER MANY OF THE STAPLES ARE NOT HAVE ACCESS TO DECISION MAKING POWER. WHERE HOW AND WHEN WILL THEIR VOICES BE HEARD. HOW DO WE HAVE ALSO THAT OPPORTUNITIES IN FISHERIES AND FISHERIES DECISION MAKING ARE OPEN TO EVERYONE. A NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY HAS SIGNALED THEY WANT TO START THIS DIALOGUE. WE ARE ONLY THE BEGINNING OF THIS IMPORTANT URGENT EFFORT AND HE'S MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES MUST BE INVITED PARTICIPANTS. RELATEDLY WE MUST THINK DEEPLY ABOUT OUR COASTAL FISHING CITIES AND TOWNS AND WHAT THE FUTURE LOOKS LIKE. FISHERIES INFRASTRUCTURES LING LING. HOURS CONSULTING ACROSS THE INDUSTRY IT'S TOO FEW HANDS. BECAUSE OUR GENTRIFYING. AND ALL THESE ECONOMIC AND SOCIAL ISSUES ARE HAPPENING IN ENVIRONMENT BUT THE CLIMATE IS CHANGING POLLUTION CONTINUES. IN OUR RIVERS AND STREAMS ARE RUNNING DRY. AS WE'VE HEARD TODAY SALMON OFFICIAL CENTRAL TO THE IDENTITIES OF MANY OF OUR SMALL SCALE FISHING COMMUNITIES AND TRIBES ALONG OUR COAST RIVERS. MAY BECOME EXTINCT FROM CALIFORNIA WATERS ON OUR WATCH. THESE ARE ISSUES THAT GO BEYOND FISHERY MANAGEMENT AND HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO SELL US AND WE NEED A NEW WAY OF THINKING AND NEW TOOLS THAT MANAGERS MUST USED RIGHT ON A FINE USE. THE COASTAL ACT PROVIDES A GOOD STRUCTURE TO HELP PROTECT THE PUBLIC'S ACCESS TO COASTAL SPACE AND WE NEED TO BUILD ON THIS GOOD ETHOS REFLECT ON PATTERNS OF RESOURCE USE. AND NATURALLY HAVE INCLUSIVE STREETS ABOUT THIRTY SECONDS. IF YOU'RE- I MENTIONED EARLIER THE NEED TO IMPROVE HOW WE COLLECT BIOLOGICAL DATA. THE SAME HOLDS TRUE FOR SOCIAL DATA. THIS IS A STEP WE CAN TAKE TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THE SOCIAL FABRIC OF OUR FISHERIES AND HELP GUIDE US TOWARDS A MORE JUST AND SUSTAINABLE AND- THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY I'M DEEPLY HONORED TO HAVE SPOKEN AT THE- GREATER FISHERIES FORUM. AND I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU SO MUCH HOW FAR ALONG ARE YOU IN YOUR DOCTORAL PROGRAM. I JUST STARTED IT SO  AM FRESH OUT IT'S STILL VERY EXCITED HELLO MY GOSH. THERE WE GO THAT IS SO EXCITING THOUGH WE ARE THRILLED FOR YOU AND CONGRATULATIONS. THANK YOU AND THERE'S JUST A LITTLE BIT OF WORK AHEAD YOU KNOW I MEAN OH MY GOODNESS. YEAH THANK YOU SO MUCH WE'RE GOING TO BE ON HIS WRITINGS IS GOING TO BE. HOLDING WITH US HERE AND I SHOULD BE READY FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS IN JUST A BIT. AT LEAST IN GENERAL NOW GONNA TURN THE FLOOR OVER TO ROGER HE LEE. AND I GOTTA SAY MR HEALY AND ALL THE COMMERCIAL LOBSTER FISHERMEN. DOWN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. THEY HAVE HAD A HELL OF A SEASON WITH THIS DEVASTATING OIL SPILL. HI MISTER GILLIES CAN UPDATE THE COMMITTEE ON THE IMPACTS OF THE OIL SPILL- IT TO HIS FISHING COMMUNITY. AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE REGULATORY PROCESS IS IMPACTED COMMERCIAL FISHING IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. MR HE LEAVES THE FLOOR IS YOURS WE WELCOME YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR TUNING THE COMMITTEE. WE'RE CHECKING IN TO SEE IF WE HAVE A- MR HEALY WHO IS ON THE LINE. JUST GIVE US ONE SECOND. BUT NOW ALL RIGHT THAT SOUNDS LIKE WE GOT TO MISTER HEALY YEAH SURE IS IT I'M NOT THE TECHNOLOGICAL WIZARD ALL RIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY I DON'T HAVE A VIDEO HOOKED UP UNFORTUNATELY GOING TO MISS MY MIKE I ATTACHED MY PARTNER MIKE IT'S RACE I. DOZENS OF YOU GET INVOLVED BUT DO NOT- ALL. RIGHT APPRECIATE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU GUYS. AND I WASN'T SURE WHAT MY THOUGHTS ARE AND I HOPE I DON'T OFFEND ANYBODY AND BY SPEAKING MY MIND BUT- IT'S HARD TO GIVE A CULMINATION OF THIRTY FOUR YEARS OF COMMERCIAL FISHING AND JUST. FIVE MINUTES BUT- I GET AROUND ABOUT MOVIE GOING THERE WILL STILL BE VERY ENDED TWENTY YEARS OF MY CAREER OFFICE VIRTUALLY EVERYTHING OUT OF THE ORANGE COUNTY OR SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST AREA LOBSTERS CRABS UP. RECENTLY BEEN WORKING EXPERIMENT BOSCO FISHERY URCHINS NEAR SHORE. MARINE CORPS AND COLLECTED BEFORE THE REGULATIONS CHECK OUT THE VIABILITY OF THAT INDUSTRY- I'VE BEEN TWENTY YEARS I'VE BEEN POLITICALLY ACTIVE ON THE PRESENT STATE BY ASSOCIATION. CALIFORNIA STATE WHY SO SHE'S A LOBSTER FISHERMEN ARE REPRESENTED IN A COKE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION. AND THOSE TWENTY YEARS LAWS CHANGED. YOU KNOW IT TWENTY YEARS AGO THIS IS PRETTY EASY TO MEET WITH THE COMMISSION AND AN- UPDATE OR AMEND ANY CODES OF DRESS THE RESOURCE ISSUES OR ANYTHING THAT NEED TO BE CHANGED. AS TIME HAS GONE ON THE DAY OF THE COMMISSION. WOULD EASILY. WORK THINGS OUT BACK TODAY. IT ALBERTA THE PAID LOBBYISTS AND SPECIALIST CHRIS THE POWER TO BE MADE A LOT MORE. FOR US. IS TO LEAVE OUR OUR WATERS TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND EVERY SINGLE BEAT AND IT WAS. NEEDED FOR US TO BE THERE. YOU'LL GET LOST. IN THE PLACE. THAT ACTUALLY REPRESENT OUR INTERESTS WERE. I THOUGHT IT WAS TIME WHEN I WAS A POLITICAL LEADER THAT I WAS NO LONGER ACTUALLY DOING THINGS PRAGMATICALLY ANYMORE BUT I WAS MORE OF A REACTIONARY FIGURE TRYING TO JUST. STAVE OFF. THE INEVITABLE MOSKOW MORE AREA FISHING REGULATIONS AMASSING ON TALKING BUST AND LACK OF ABILITY TO ACCESS THE RESOURCES- IT IT I'LL GIVE YOU A QUICK EXAMPLE DOES THE LOBSTER FISHERY MANAGEMENT PLAN WHICH WAS PUT INTO PLACE A FEW YEARS BACK I WAS ONE OF THE CONSTITUENTS THAT REPRESENTED THE- GROUP ONE OF THE- LEADERS THAT REPRESENT A COMMERCIAL FISHING PART OF IT. WE SPENT TWO YEARS IN MEETINGS WE HAD A CHARTER IS VERY SPECIFIC THAT WE OUT OF. ALL COMPLETELY AGREE OR AT LEAST COME TO A CONSENSUS. IN THE VERY END OF IT WE ALWAYS END UP WITH IS A LOT MORE REGULATIONS FOR THE COMMERCIAL BASICALLY. AND WE'VE ACTUALLY DID NOTHING FOR THE SPORT FISHING LAKE WHICH THE ONLY REASON I WAS REALLY THERE IS LESS CONCERNED ABOUT THE- COMMERCIALIZATION OF THE SPORT FISHING FLEET INTO. THEIR ABILITY FOR THEM TO BE HARVESTED. PRETTY MUCH UNLIMITED CAPACITY SO LIMITED DAYS SEVEN LOSSES TODAY THE GUYS ALREADY INQUIRE INTO WORDS THAT THE WORDS ARE HARVESTED. SPORT FISHING. WISE UNDER LEGAL OFFICERS THIS SEASON. WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN YEAR BUT I BELIEVE THE M. L. APRIL. AND TO. SO THIS FINANCE. COMMERCIAL GROUPS AND NOW THEY HAVE MADE CAREERS OUT OF. GAMBLING IN CALIFORNIA'S BAY STREETS. ADDING NEW BILLS TO FURTHER SQUEEZE COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN OUT OF BUSINESS. SUSPECTS AS THE ROPELESS GEAR DECIDED TALKED ABOUT YOU KNOW AMBITION LIST. PARDON YOU KNOW COMBUSTIBLE ENGINES THEY'RE NOT EVEN PRACTICAL REALISTIC AND IT BUT SUCH ONEROUS. REGULATIONS HONESTLY IT IT BASICALLY TAKES UP THE PROFITABILITY OF THE OFFICIAL. ON THE OTHER HAND ALL DAY PROCESS AND THE RESULTING RE PROTECTED AREAS BUT PLACED COMPLETELY NEUTERED THE ORANGE COUNTY FISHERIES ARE COMMERCIAL FISHING FLEET. I BELIEVE OR ABOUT LESS THAN HALF THE SIZE WE WERE AT ONE TIME. THEN WE'VE BEEN NEGATED DOWN TO JUST BE ABLE TO FISH BASICALLY ONE SPECIES WHICH IS LOBSTER I BEST I DO HAVE AN URGENT PERMIT IF THEY WANT TO HAVE A JOB BIBLE FOR URGE YOU STICKERS LEFT OPEN TO ASSIST. IS MARGINAL AT BEST SUITS STILL WHERE WE USED TO BE A HARVEST LOT OF A LOT OF IT IF YOU LOOK AT THE ORANGE COUNTY COASTLINE FROM NEWPORT STANDPOINT THE LEADING REALLY ALLOWED TO TAKE HIS OFFICERS THAT'S THE ONLY VIABLE COMMODITY TO ASSUME. MANAGERS IN OUR AREA WE HAVE A NEW MARINE MANAGER YOU CAN START MARINA MANAGER YET THE ALL THE SIZE OF OUR FLEET IS DIMINISHED SO MUCH THAT THAT LOOK THIS IS ACTUALLY USED TO BE THIS SERIES ANYMORE DID. YOU THINK OF A SIMPLE ANSWER HOBBYIST. MATT AND HAS. BAD BECAUSE- FOR US. THEY DON'T. A DEGREE OF. AT HELP OUT OR US ANY- THING AND WORK YOU STILL YOU THAT THE PROBLEM OUR COME FISHING. YOU KNOW THAT RELIES ON ONE RESOURCE MAKES US VERY VULNERABLE TO MARKET TRENDS RESOURCE ALTERNATIVE AND NATURAL AND MAN MADE DISASTERS SUCH AS THIS OIL SPILL. I DON'T KNOW HOW WELL A COMPANY CAN MEANS UNCONSCIONABLE FOR ME TO HELP AN OLD COMPANY WORKING IN ST LOUIS SLABS I GUESS WORK BETTER LANCE. IT'S VIRTUALLY INSOLVENT AND DOESN'T HAVE THE ABILITY. TO EASILY WE DON'T KNOW YET THEY'RE NOT TO PAY OFF. THE DEBT TO GET THIS DONE SO ARE YOUR LOCAL FISHERMEN. I'VE BEEN DOING THIS LONG ENOUGH THAT I PROBABLY WILL SURVIVE THIS BUT I'VE GOT SEVERAL GUYS THAT REPRESENT. NIGHT YOU'LL GET CHOKED UP. THE PRODUCTS ARE THIS THEY ARE CAUGHT. SOME I THIS AS RELIEF FOR FIRE FLOODS AND OTHER. OR BANDAGES. AND IT WHAT ALL THOSE GOOD PRICE DO A SETTLEMENT REALLY QUICKLY WITH THE WELL% COMPANY BUT WHAT'S REALLY QUICKLY TWO YEARS. WHAT ARE FISHERMEN JOSH HERNANDEZ ON ABLE BODIED. IS THIS IS THIRD YEAR FISHING AND HE'S GOT A TWO YEAR OLD A BABY COMING AND HE'S GOTEVERYTHING INTO THIS YOU GOT CREDIT CARD DEBT AND EVERYTHING ELSE. HE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE A DIFFERENCE. AND I DON'T KNOW IF HE WILL BE AROUND IN YEARS TO COME THINGS AREN'T. RECTIFIED SOON ALLOWED HIM TO GO FISH AND ALL THE REST OF US. I DIDN'T WANT TO SELL TO GET DISGRUNTLED FISHERMEN. IT ALL I HAD A FEW MORE THINGS. WILL SPILL RESPONSE IS PRETTY MASSIVE THERE'S A LOT OF PLAYERS IN IT DOCTOR SOON ENOUGH SURE IS LISTENING ON THE LINE HAS BEEN VERY HELPFUL IN TRYING TO GET TO MEDICATIONS UP TO US BUT IT'S BEEN AN ONGOING NOT LIVING AGAINST THE POWERS TO BE A BIT. WITH ALL POWERS THEY'RE WORKING IN THIS IN THIS AREA RIGHT NOW IT'S AMAZING I'VE LEARNED MORE FROM. DIRECTOR BONNIE TODAY THAN I'VE LEARNED IN THE LAST MONTH. I THOUGHT YOU'RE GONNA BE OPEN AROUND. YEAH NOVEMBER FIRST ONLY LEARN I CAN A LOT OF LIKE TO LOVE THIS. FOR THEM TO DO TESTING ON I JUST LEARNING AS OF LAST NIGHT IT'S GOING TO BE DECEMBER FIRST NOW. WHEN YOU HAVE THE BLOOD DROPS THE WATER IN YOUR SITTING TIED TO THE DOCK AND YOU'RE WAITING TO BURN YOUR FIRST DOLLAR FOR THE YEAR IT'S PRETTY. DIFFICULT I MEAN FOR ME PERSONALLY I'M TRYING TO GET INFORMATION ALL THE CONSTITUENTS AND THE PEOPLE THAT WORK AROUND THIS AND ARE TRYING TO ALSO LIVE. OFF THE OCEAN LOCALLY. AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF ANSWERS AND THERE'S NOT A LOT OF DIRECTION AND- SHUTTING DOWN THE HARBOR. DR I JUST NEED TO ATTRACT FORTY FEET OF WATER TO TEN FEET OF WATER. WHAT. DID NOT ZERO NOTIFICATION. IT SCARED ME TO DEATH BECAUSE YOU LOSE ALL MY TRAPS MR STILL WITHOUT GETTING TOO VERBOSE THOSE ARE BASICALLY. SOME OF THE THINGS I'M DEALING WITH. AS THE MORE REGULATIONS COMING TO PLACE THEM IN. YOUR CITY COMMERCIAL BASEMENT THE TABLE VERY OFTEN BECAUSE THEY'RE JUST SUCH LONG PROCESSES THAT MEET WITH ARCADE INDIVIDUALS TO BE THEIR- VOLUNTEER. AT AN UNFORTUNATE WE CAN'T BE AT EVERY MEETING IN YOUR- YOU. I SO APPRECIATE IT TO YOU GUYS AFTER LISTEN THIS ALL DAY ACTUALLY LISTEN TO US AND BEING THERE. AND BEEN FIGHTING ON OUR BEHALF AND- ALL LEAVE IT OPEN FOR A QUESTION IF YOU HAVE AFTER THIS. RELATED WANT TO SAY THANK YOU MISS HEALY'S LOBSTER FISHERMEN FROM GENCO- AND I JUST WANT TO SAY HOW GRATEFUL WE ARE. FOR YOU TO BE AT OR PROVIDE THIS VERY PERSONAL TESTIMONY ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF LOBSTER FISHERMEN IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THE IMPACT OF THE OIL SPILL IN WHY THE STAKES ARE SO HIGH. IN THE EXAMPLE YOU JUST GAVE UP THE GENTLEMAN WHO HAS A TWO YEAR OLD AT HOME TRYING TO BE ABLE TO MAKE A RENT OR MORTGAGE AND CAR PAYMENTS AND- NOT NOT ABLE TO FISH TO BE ABLE TO BRING IN THE DOLLARS. WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE YOU BRING THAT FORWARD IN. I PROMISE IT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU SIR- AND- KEEPING TRACK OF. THE COMPENSATION IS GOING TO BE NEEDED. ON SO MANY LEVELS AND IN PARTICULAR FOR THE FLEET TO MR HEALY THANK YOU SO MUCH. LAYS IN GERMAN WE'RE NOW GOING TO BE A TURNING IT BACK OVER TO MIKE CONROY. AS YOU REMEMBER MR CONROY- IS THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC COAST. FEDERATION OF FISHERMEN'S ASSOCIATION. MIKE IS BACK WITH US TO TALK ABOUT HOW WE CAN SUPPORT FISHING COMMUNITIES UP AND DOWN THE COAST. IMAGE GALLERY A PLEASE CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT- YOU KNOW SO MUCH OF THIS IS IN REGARDS TO INFRASTRUCTURE IN THE NEED FOR. INFRASTRUCTURE FUNDING. SO THAT WHEN- WE DO HAVE A THRIVING PORT. THAT WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE THERE HAD TO BE ABLE TO KEEP IT MOVING FOR THE ECONOMY MOVING FORWARD. AND SO MANY OF THESE COMMUNITIES. THAT PCS OKAY REPRESENTS AS FAR AS- DIFFERENT PORT ASSOCIATIONS THAT YOU'RE ABLE TO. KEEP THIS INDUSTRY MOVING BECAUSE THERE'S INFRASTRUCTURE THERE THAT KEEPS THE FLEET GOING. LIKE I DON'T WANT TO PUT WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH I'LL TURN IT OVER TO YOU FOR YOUR- FULL BRIEFING FIVE MINUTES SIR. YEAH AGAIN SENATOR YEAH YOU'RE RIGHT INTEREST. PLAYS A CRITICAL COMPONENT TO THIS OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES BUT I'LL TOUCH ON THAT A LITTLE BIT. BY WAY OF INTRODUCTION MY NAME IS MIKE CONROY AND UNLESS MY BOARD IS THAT A CHANGE OF HEART SINCE THE DECRYPT HELL I'MSTILL THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR PC FFA. WHEN THE IDEA THE FISHERIES FORUM WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IN THE LIST OF TOPICS TO BE DISCUSSED COVERED I LEAPT AT THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN THIS PANEL LET THE COMMUNITY SPELL AS I UNDERSTOOD IT WAS TASKED WITH ADDRESSING ACCESS PERMITTING SPACE. BUT FAR TOO OFTEN WE GET WRAPPED AROUND THE AXLE ON FISHERY SPECIFIC ISSUES. AS EVIDENCED BY PRIOR PANELS AND LOSE SIGHT OF THE IMPORTANT BIGGER PICTURE ITEMS SUCH AS ACCESS PERMITTING IN SPACE. IN COVERING THESE TOPICS IT WAS SUGGESTED WE HIGHLIGHT THE GOOD AND THE BAD AND PROVIDE SPECIFIC POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS. WHAT YOU'LL HEAR THAT BUT I WILL CONCLUDE WITH THE UGLY. PERMITTING PERMITTING SOME GOOD YEAR YOUR SP EIGHTIES PROVISIONS. EASY TRANSFERABILITY OF DUNGENESS CRAB PERMITS ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE BASS PERMITS REMAIN INACCESSIBLE TO THE NEXT GENERATION OF COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND WOMEN. DUE TO AVAILABILITY AND WHEN AVAILABLE AND WHEN AVAILABLE IN SOME CASES COST. WAITING PERMITS APARTMENTS BEING HELD BY SPECULATORS RATHER SEE PERMIT HOLDERS THERE'S ALSO A BAD THING. A SPECIFIC POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS CONSIDER MAKING COMMERCIAL FISHING PERMITS REASONABLE. I CONSIDER COMMUNITY OWNERSHIP APARTMENTS WITH AN ABILITY FOR THOSE PERMITS TO BE LEASED TO COMMUNITY MEMBERS I THINK THEY'RE FROM SHERRY. FROM THE MY BASS FISHERIES TRUST NEXT AND THEY HAVE A THEY CAN BE USED AS A MODEL FOR THAT. CONSIDER ACTIVITY REQUIREMENT WITH EXCEPTIONS TO AVOID PERMIT SPECULATING IN LAYTON PERMITS DEPRIVING CALIFORNIANS OF SEAFOOD. CONSIDER APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS AND M. C. GRETA SAN DIEGO'S DOING SOMETHING WITH THAT WITH THE LOCAL FISHERMEN DOWN THERE. THAT CONSIDER LOTTERIES FOR AVOID NON RENEWED OR REVOKED PERMITS LIMITED TO THOSE. WITH A HISTORY OF THAT SPECIFIC TREASURY. MOVING ON JACK. AS YOU KNOW SIX. MEANWHILE ALONG THOSE. FISHERMEN NEED ACCESS. THE GOOD IN UNDER ACCESS CALIFORNIA COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND WOMEN ROSE TO THE OCCASION AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO HEALTHY AND SUSTAINABLE SOURCE OF PROTEIN DURING THE PAST TEN- LIBERATION OF DIRECT MARKETING IN BOTH THE DOOR DELIVERIES A LOT OF CALIFORNIA'S FUTURE TO BE AVAILABLE IN BEEF POULTRY AND PORK SUPPLY CHAINS. WERE DISRUPTED BY COVERT. DURING COPE WITH THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN GRACIOUS MAKING TIME TO SPEAK PLEASE STAND IN DEEP CRAB. FISHERMEN IMPACTED BY THE RECENT OIL SPILL IN PARTICULAR. BUT ALSO THE LARGER COMMERCIAL INDUSTRY REGARDING BOTH ROUNDS OF THE CHAIRS ACCESSORIES SYSTEMS. PERMITS RENT TO THE COUNCIL ALSO DESERVE KUDOS FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO ENGAGE WITH INDUSTRY. BUT FOR THEIR EFFORTS MANY ACTIONS BENEFICIAL TO OUR MEMBERS AND INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE FOR EXAMPLE INCREASED ACCESS TO MONTREAL OR C. IS WHICH IS ONGOING FAVORABLE SANTA SEASON FEDERALLY APPEARS TO CAPTURE NURSE FOR DATA FOR CPS STOCKS. WOULD LIKELY STILL BE CONCEPTUAL. THE BAD IN TERMS OF ACCESS WHAT MY MEMBERS OFFERED A FEW COMMON OBSERVATIONS HERE THE FISHING INDUSTRY BELIEVES IT IS UNDER REPRESENTED UNDER HER LARGELY IGNORED AND UNDER APPRECIATED. THE GOVERNOR'S. EXECUTIVE ORDER REGARDING THIRTY BY THIRTY WAS EXECUTED OVER A YEAR AGO AND DESPITE BEING PROMISED A SEAT AT THAT TABLE WE ARE STILL LOOKING FOR THE TABLE. TO HEAR MR GOLD SAY THE PATHWAY DOCUMENT IS DUE OUT SOON WITHOUT ANY INPUT FROM THE FISHING INDUSTRY. EVIDENCE IS DESTROYED. STATE AGENCIES AND APPOINTEES WITH LITTLE TO NO FISHING KNOWLEDGE ARE PROPOSING AN ACTING ACTIONS RULES AND REGULATIONS. WHICH COULD HAVE PROFOUND IMPACTS ON OUR ABILITY TO OPERATE. THERE ARE OHER EFFORTS WHICH POTENTIALLY ELIMINATE OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS PRODUCTIVE FISHING AREAS. OFFSHORE WIND IS ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO OUR LIVELIHOODS CALL AREAS RIGHT DOWN TO FIGHT OFF THE CALIFORNIA COAST BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN. WITH LITTLE TO NO THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE IMPORTANCE OF USERS TO THE FISHING INDUSTRY. THE LACK OF MEANINGFUL ENGAGEMENT WITH THE FISHING COMMUNITY CONTINUES THERE ARE NOTABLE EXCEPTIONS THE STATE LANDS COMMISSION WITH THE VANDERBURGH PROJECTS. IN RECENT CONVERSATIONS WITH THE DEPARTMENT WOULD SEEM TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSITION. EARRINGS ARE REPEATED COMPLAINTS REGARDING ENGAGEMENT. MANY QUESTIONS WE HAVE ASKED FOUNDATIONAL QUESTIONS ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL AND ECOLOGICAL IMPACTS OF OFFSHORE WIND REMAINED UNANSWERED NEWS STORIES ABOUT FAILURES ISSUES AND I'M NOT GONNA FIGHT CONSEQUENCES OFFSHORE WIND UP BECOMING MORE AND MORE COMMONPLACE JUST LAST WEEK WE LEARNED OF A FIRE INVOLVING OFFSHORE WIND FARMS OFF THE NETHERLANDS ONE OF THREE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE FIRES REPORTED INVOLVING OFFSHORE WIND OVER THE LAST TWENTY YEARS. OUR MARINE ECOSYSTEM IS TOO IMPORTANT TO OUR STATE TO ALLOW INDUSTRIALIZATION WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACTS BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE. KNOWLEDGE PROVISIONS OF AB TWENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IT HOPE IT ENDS UP BEING MORE THAN WORDS ON THE PAGE WITH REGARD TO AQUACULTURE WEEKLY IT KNOWLEDGE THAT THERE ARE. DIFFERENT FORMS AND TYPE OF AQUACULTURE. MAIN CONCERN ABOUT- OPEN WATER AND FISH SELL THESE INTRA OF LOSS OF FISHING. AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS SURROUNDING THE OPERATIONS. AND AS WE HIGHLIGHTED EARLIER FROM BOTH GEORGE JOHN AND- THE PLIGHT OF THE STATE'S SALMON FISHERIES. I WILL NOTE THAT RECENT STUDIES HAVE POSTULATED THAT COVERING CALIFORNIA'S AQUEDUCTS AND SOLAR PANELS. TO GENERATE EIGHT GIGAWATTS OF RENEWABLE ENERGY WELL SAVING MILLIONS OF GALLONS OF WATER FROM EVAPORATION WE SHOULD PRIORITIZE LOOKING AT THAT. IN TERMS OF POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS WITH THIS REGARD YOU'RE SURE THAT THE FISHING INDUSTRY BOTH COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL HAD MEANINGFUL ROLES AN ACTIVE VOICE IN CONVERSATIONS. RELATED TO ACTIVITIES THAT INITIAL RESISTANCE RESTRICT. OUR ACCESS FOR EXAMPLE THIRTY. AFTER WINNING. AN AWFUL. CONSIDER REQUIRING FISHING EXPERIENCE AND BACKGROUND FOR APPOINTEES TO THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION AS MEMBERS. THE COMMITTEE NOW OUR FISHERIES ARE NUANCED AND MANAGEMENT OF THOSE REQUIRED OF THOSE REQUIRE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE AND HOW THESE FISHERIES OPERATE THERE IS A GROWING CONCERN THAT THE COMMISSION DOESN'T HAVE THAT NECESSARY EXPERTISE. THERE IS WANT TO WRAP UP BY TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE UGLIER WE'RE WE'RE LOOKING AT ME THAT THERE IS A VERY REAL FEAR THAT ABSENT SUPPORT THERE MAY BE NO COMMERCIAL FISHING IN CALIFORNIA WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS EVERY YEAR WE ARE ASKED TO GET MORE CATCH LAST AND CHANGE OUR OPERATING BUSINESS MODELS. THE FISHERMEN JUST TEXTED ME AND HIGHLIGHTED THE INCREASED COST OF OPERATING FROM INSURANCE TO FUEL TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT TREATMENT OF CRUISE WE ASK THAT THE EXEMPTION PROVIDED FOR THE COMMERCIAL FISHING. INDUSTRY UNDER EIGHTY FIVE BE EXTENDED. COREY NOTED WE NEED TO PRIORITIZE SCIENCE TO GET TOGETHER TO MAKE OUR FISHERIES RESILIENT. TO CHANGING OCEAN CONDITIONS. WE MUST ALSO UNDERSTAND THE DEMOGRAPHICS THE CURRENT STATE OF INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH SUPPORTS FISHING ACTIVITIES AND PORTS AND HARBORS UP AND DOWN THE STATE. AND ANALYZE WHETHER THESE FACILITIES CONTINUE TO SERVE COMMUNITIES THAT THEY SUPPORT. I WAS GONNA I WAS GONNA LET LEAVE ROGERS TESTIFYING AS HE SAID I DON'T KNOW THAT I COULDN'T STAND IT ANY BETTER. WE MUST NOT FORGET THAT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF CALIFORNIANS THE ONLY ACCESS THEY HAVE TO THE LIVING REEF RESOURCES ARE STATE WATERS. IS THROUGH THE SEAFOOD WE HARVEST FOR THEM. ACTUALLY JUST RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE CALIFORNIA'S HEALTHY SOURCE OF PROTEIN. OFTEN WITH A MUCH LOWER CARBON FOOTPRINT VIS A VIS OTHER SOURCES OF PROTEIN WILL OFTEN DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED VANISHED YEARS WE'RE GONNA NEED A REFERENCE OF UNREALITY RECOMMENDATION. CALIFORNIA'S FISHERMEN AND WOMEN NEED A CHAMPION WE ARE LOOKING TO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE TO RISE UP AND TAKE THAT ROLE FOR US. TO THAT END WE SUGGEST FINDING SUPPORT MANY THE IDEAS AND SUGGESTIONS YOU HAVE HEARD HERE TODAY. TALK TO US AND LISTEN TO US WE ARE APPROACHABLE MOST OF THE TIME. WE ARE PEOPLE JUST LIKE YOU WE HAVE FAMILIES JUST LIKE YOU WE ARE DOING THE BEST WE CAN IN VERY CHALLENGING TIMES IN CONDITIONS THANK YOU WE MAKE MISTAKES BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE DEFINED BY THOSE MISTAKES. THANKS NO THANK YOU SO MUCH HAS GONE RIGHT WE'RE REALLY GRATEFUL FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP YOUR ADVOCACY AND OF COURSE TCFA VERY VERY APPRECIATIVE OF YOUR WORDS THANK YOU SO MUCH. AT LEAST IN GERMAN WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE TO GO TO SHERRY FORMER FELLOW FORMER TELL EXCUSE ME EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MONTEREY BAY FISHERIES TRUST. THIS FORMER FELT IS JOINING US FOR THE FIRST TIME AND WE ARE SO APPRECIATIVE OF HER WORK AND THAT SHE IS HERE TODAY WE HOPE THIS IS. NOT NEARLY THE LAST AND THIS IS GONNA BE A LONG STANDING CONVERSATION THAT WE HAVE MISSED WITH HIS FORMER FELT AS WELL AS A MODERATE FISHERIES TRUST. HE'S GOING TO TALK ABOUT HER ORGANIZATION'S APPROACH TO ENSURING. SUSTAINED ACCESS TO SUSTAINABLE FISHERIES MADAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE FIVE MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND. PROMPT AS YOU GET CLOSE TO THE END WELCOME. I YOU AND- THANK FOR THE- TO SPEAK TODAY CAN YOU HEAR ME OK. YOU ARE COMING IN AND CLEAR EXACTLY. EXCELLENT MY NAME IS GEORGE WONDERFUL TONIGHT THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE MONTEREY BAY FISHERIES TRUST. AND WE ARE NON PROFIT THAT WORKS WITH COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND SEAFOOD BUSINESSES. LOCAL GOVERNMENT CONSERVATION GROUPS AND OTHERS TO FIND A BALANCE BETWEEN A HEALTHY OCEAN ENVIRONMENT. AND A HEALTHY LOCAL SEAFOOD ECONOMY. A COMMERCIAL FISHING IS SUCH AN IMPORTANT PART OF THE CULTURE AND ECONOMY OF MONTEREY BAY. AND IT'S ESSENTIAL FOR FOOD SECURITY AS THE PENTECOSTAL. WE FEEL STRONGLY THAT OUR COASTAL COMMUNITIES SHOULD HAVE ACCESS TO LOCAL SUSTAINABLY HARVESTED SEAFOOD. AND SHOULDN'T HAVE TO RELY ON SEAFOOD IMPORTED FROM ACROSS THE WORLD OFTEN CAUGHT UNSUSTAINABLY AND WITH QUESTIONABLE LABOR PRACTICES. THERE'S NO REASON WHY THAT SHOULD BE THE CASE WE HAVE MANY HEALTHY FISH STOCKS. ROBUST FISHERIES MANAGEMENT A GROWING LOCAL FOOD MOVEMENT AND FISHERMEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE EAGER TO WORK. BUT AS ROGER AND MIKE AND OTHERS HAVE DISCUSSED BEFORE ME CALIFORNIA'S FISHING INDUSTRY IS FACED WITH ENORMOUS CHALLENGES AND OBSTACLES. AS A FISHERMAN SAID TO ME THE OTHER DAY IT FEELS LIKE A BUCKET FULL OF HOLES THAT JUST KEEPS BRINGING NEW LEAKS AND EVERY TIME YOU PLUG ONE HOLE ANOTHER HOLE OPENS UP. SO THIS PANEL IS ABOUT HOW TO KEEP CALIFORNIA FISHERIES AND COASTAL COMMUNITIES THRIVING. SO WHAT NEEDS TO BE IN PLACE IN ORDER TO DO THAT. WE NEED HEALTHY FISH STOCKS IN ECOSYSTEMS WHICH DEPENDS ON EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT AND STEWARDSHIP. AND THE MEANINGFUL PARTICIPATION OF FISHERY STAKEHOLDERS. FISHERMEN NEED ACCESS TO FISHING RIGHTS THAT ARE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE AND THEY ALSO NEED ACCESS TO THEIR PRODUCTIVE FISHING GROUNDS. THEY NEED INFRASTRUCTURE WITH ICE MACHINES FUEL STORAGE IN A MIX OF BUSINESS SENSE. AND THEY NEED A DIVERSITY OF MARKETS IN CHOICE. AND IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO HAVE A DIVERSITY OF FISHERIES AND BOTH THE INDIVIDUAL LEVEL AND SUPPORT LEVEL. A JUSTICE FISHERMEN DO BETTER WHEN THEY HAVE MULTIPLE APARTMENTS STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE MOST RESILIENT FISHING PORTS ARE THOSE THAT HAVE A MIX OF FISHERIES INCLUDING HIGH VOLUME LOW VOLUME DIFFERENT. ISSUE STRUGGLING FISHERMEN CAN LEAN ON OTHER FISHERIES AND THIS MAINTAINS A CENTRAL PROCESSING AND POOR INFRASTRUCTURE AS WELL AS MARKETS. AND FINALLY THE FISHING INDUSTRY NEEDS A SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT WITH GOVERNMENT MANAGERS CONSUMERS COMMUNITY PARTNERS LENDERS AND OTHER STOCKING. AT THE MONTEREY BAY FISHERIES TRUST WE BELIEVE WE NEED TO BE MOVING FORWARD ON ALL OF THESE FRONTS TO STRENGTHEN THE WHOLE SYSTEM AND IN DOING SO WE CAN BUILD RESILIENCE IN OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY'RE STRONGER AND BETTER ABLE TO WEATHER FUTURE STORMS. AMONG OUR PROGRAMS- WE STARTED IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN AS A COMMUNITY QUOTA FUNDS FOR THE WEST COAST GROUNDFISH TRAWL FISHERY. TO PROTECT OUR COMMUNITY'S FUTURE ACCESS TO THIS HIGH VOLUME YEAR ROUND FISHERY. THIS WAS INTENDED TO PREVENT SOME OF THE EFFECTS OF CONSOLIDATION IN THE CAPTURE PROGRAM. SO WE HOLD QUOTA AND PERMITS AND WE SOME TO FISHERMEN AT AFFORDABLE RATES. BUT THIS IS JUST FOR ONE FISHERY. AND WE'RE STARTING TO EXPLORE WHETHER. WHETHER THERE'S A ROLE FOR GROUPS LIKE OURS TO PLAY IN OTHER FISHERIES TO HELP ADDRESS ISSUES OF ACCESS AND AFFORDABILITY. THERE ARE MANY SMALL SCALE FISHERMEN AND FISHING BUSINESSES THAT ARE UNDER REPRESENTED. AND DON'T HAVE THE BACKING AND RESOURCES THAT LARGER DISTANCES YOU. SO WE WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY ARE SUPPORTED AND THEY THEY HAVE THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED. TO WORK WORKING TO MAKE IT EASIER FOR FISHERMEN TO STAY INFORMED AND INVOLVED IN THE MANAGEMENT PROCESS TO ENSURE THEY HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE WHEN DECISIONS ARE BEING MADE THAT IMPACT THEIR LIVELIHOODS. WE ALSO PROVIDE BUSINESS SUPPORT SUCH AS HELPING FISHERMEN NAVIGATE COVERT RELIEF OPPORTUNITIES SECURE LOANS. OR HELP THEM FIGURE OUT THE PERMITS REQUIRED TO SELL OFF THE BOAT. OUR ORGANIZATION IS ALSO WORKING TO SUPPORT THE EXISTING STEWARDSHIP OF LOCAL FISHERMEN THROW LOST YOUR RECOVERY PROJECT THAT WE OPERATE OUT OF MONTEREY MOSS LANDING AT SANTA CRUZ. AND YOUR CV DONATION PROGRAM WE'VE BEEN HELPING THE STUDENTS SECURE IN OUR COMMUNITY WHILE FILLING MARKET FLOYD'S FOR THE FISHING INDUSTRY DURING THE PANDEMIC. A BIG PART OF WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO IS TO CREATE A MORE SUPPORTIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR FISHING COMMUNITIES WHICH INVOLVES RAISING CONSUMER AWARENESS ABOUT LOCAL SEAFOOD. AND BUILDING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN FISHERMEN AND GOVERNMENT CONSERVATION GROUPS AND OTHERS. MUCH OF OUR WORK IS GUIDED BY THE PRINCIPLES OF INCLUSIVITY AND COLLABORATION WE ALL NEED TO BE WORKING TOGETHER THE REGULATORS MANAGERS NGOS MARKETS PROCESSORS AND THE FISHERMEN. WHO ALSO NEED TO BE WORKING WITH EACH OTHER ACROSS YOUR TYPES TO LIST THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY. AS THE SAYING GOES A RISING TIDE LIFTS ALL BOATS. RECENT STUDIES HAVE FOUND THAT COMMERCIAL FISHING COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE SUCCESSFULLY REBUILT AFTER DECLINE ARE THOSE WITH STRONG SOCIAL CAPITAL IN TERMS OF COOPERATION TRUST LEADERSHIP AND THE SUPPORT OF EXTERNAL ORGANIZATIONS. TOGETHER WE ALL NEED TO INCREASE THAT SUPPORT AND STRENGTHEN THOSE RELATIONSHIPS AND HOPEFULLY CREATE RESILIENCY FOR OUR FISHING COMMUNITIES MOVING FORWARD. AND OUR STATE LEADERS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE IN ALL OF THIS THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH READING EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR MADAM EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR I'M GONNA COME STRAIGHT TO YOU ON QUESTIONS TO LOOK YOU HAVE ONE FISHERY FOCUSED IN ON- AND LOOKING TO EXPAND SO TALK TO US ABOUT WHAT THAT LOOKS LIKE IN REGARDS TO EXPANDING NUMBER ONE. AND THEN NUMBER TWO ARE YOU THINKING OF JUST ABOUT EXPANDING WITHIN THE GREATER- MONTEREY BAY AREA OR LOOKING EXPANDING ACROSS THE STATE. BECAUSE I THINK YOU MAY BE ON TO SOMETHING IN REGARDS TO POTENTIAL ROOT REPLICATING IT HERE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT I'LL TURN IT OVER TO HIS FORMER FOE. WELL I'D SAY LOOKING TO. IS EVEN COMMIT YOUR WORK WORKS LAWRENCE NO OCEANSIDE STRESSES LOOKING UP BLACK'S ABILITY PERMITTING SYSTEMS AND- YOU KNOW A NUMBER OF THINGS THAT NEED TO HAPPEN FOR AN ORGANIZATION TO HOLD FISHING RIGHTS FOR. FOR THE LOCAL FISHING COMMUNITY AROUND YES LOTS OF BILLION FROM CURRENCY TRANSFER BILITY CURRENTLY YOU'RE NOT ABLE TO BE CERTAIN CERTAIN PERMITS- WHICH YOU KNOW IT IF YOU WERE ALLOWED TO IN A COMMUNITY GROUP COULD HOLD THOSE PERMITS. IT COULD OPEN THE DOOR FOR NEW ENTRANTS FOR EXAMPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD YOU KNOW FIFTY TO SEVENTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YOUR SHORT TERM AND OR- OR- YOU KNOW FORTY TO NINETY THOUSAND DOLLAR DENTURES PROPERLY OR WHATEVER THE COST MAY BE. SO IT COULD OPEN THE DOOR ALLOW THE BABIES ARE BEING USED TO OWN SCENARIOS MAYBE IT WOULD JUST BE- YOU KNOW THAT YOU RESET ON A LOTTERY SYSTEM. BUT WHAT YOU KNOW WE'RE THE MONETIZATION STRUCTURE MISSION IS WORRIED DAYPARTS BUT- I COULD SEE OTHER THERE ARE OTHER PRODUCT LINES UP NOW BECAUSE THERE ARE OTHER ORGANIZATIONS THAT. WE COULD DO THIS AND I THINK THE CRITICAL CRITICAL PIECE OF IT WOULD HAVE TO BE TO DESIGN. IT WITH. IN MY THIS COMP. TO SET UP ARE A LOT OF ISSUES FROM SO I'M GLAD I ASKED YOU. DAVIS OVER LESS. AT SHERRY FORMER EXIT RECORD THE MONOMER MODERATE FISHERIES TRUSTING YOU SO MUCH FOR MAY TAKE A RETURN ON A GO TO MR. YOU RIGHT LOOK. I THINK THAT THERE IS SOME FRUSTRATION IN THE SECOND ROUND JUST BEFORE THE VERY BLUNT IN FULL DISCLOSURE WE WORK A LOT TOGETHER ON. THE ISSUES IMPACTING FISHERIES- BECAUSE OF MY ROLE HERE ON THE COMMITTEE. AND I THINK MY FRUSTRATION. IS YOUR FRUSTRATION IS. I WIND HUNT 10% SUPPORTER OF OFFSHORE WIND. BUT I THINK ONE OF THE LAST THINGS FOLKS THINK ABOUT. IS THE FLEET IN PUTTING THE FLEET AT THE TABLE AND ENSURING THAT- IF THERE ARE IF THERE'S GONNA BE ANY LOSS OF FISHING GROUNDS. THAT THERE IS FAIR AND JUST COMPENSATION FOR THAT- BUT LOOK I DON'T WANT THE WORDS IN YOUR MOUTH SIR I THINK WHAT DO YOU THINK IT'S GOING TO TAKE TO BE TO GET ADDITIONAL SEATS AT THE TABLE. ON VARYING INITIATIVES THAT ARE MOVING FORWARD HERE IN THE CITY CALIFORNIA. YEAH THANKS FOR THAT QUESTION AND THAT'S A GREAT QUESTION. WE HAVE BEEN TRYING FOR. YOU NO SENSE OF CALL AREAS CAME OUT IN. SEPTEMBER OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN TO INTERJECT OURSELVES IN THE PROCESS- AS YOU WELL KNOW. YEAH THESE INTER GOVERNMENTAL TASK FORCES THAT OPERATE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. THERE ARE LIMITED TO GOVERNMENTAL AGENCIES GOVERNMENTAL PARTICIPATION. SO OUTSIDE STAKEHOLDERS THE FISHING INDUSTRY FOR EXAMPLE HAS HAS A DIFFICULT TIME IN IN GETTING A SEAT AT THAT TABLE. I'M REALLY BEEN SUCCESSFUL WE JUST- WE WERE ABLE TO GET THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL. TO ESTABLISH A MARINE PLANNING COMMITTEE THAT THAT IS GOING TO BE ADDRESSING ITEMS WITH REGARDS TO OFFSHORE WIND IN TERMS OF. ENSURING THAT THAT FISHERIES DATA IS USED IN INFORMING THE SITE SELECTION PROCESS. WHICH HOPEFULLY WILL BE USEFUL MOVING FORWARD. BUT YOU KNOW LIKE I SAID THAT THAT THE MORRO BAY CALLER THE DIABLO CANYON CALL AREA. AND THE HUMBLE CALL EVERYWHERE ALL DONE. REALLY WITHOUT ANY CONSIDERATION OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THE NEEDS OF THE LOCAL FISHING COMMUNITIES THOSE AREAS. YEAH WE'RE WE'RE WE'RE- QUITE WELL AWARE THAT THERE ARE OTHER AREAS. YOU KNOW PRETTY MUCH FROM MENDOCINO UP TO THE OREGON BORDER THAT ARE BEING CONSIDERED FOR ADDITIONAL OFFSHORE WIND. SITING PROCESSES. AND WE'RE JUST HOPEFUL THAT YOU KNOW DURING THE SITE SELECTION PROCESS WERE INVITED TO PARTICIPATE. THAT FISHERIES DATA IS USED TO HELP INFORM THE PROCESS. IN THAT WORD YEAH YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT. WE'RE AT THE TABLE AS OPPOSED ON THE MENU. I HAD A 10% THANK YOU SO MUCH RISK ON OR THIS. QUICK ON THE- OF THE A CRIME COMMUNITIES INITIATIVE- THAT THE PACIFIC FISHERY MANAGEMENT COUNCIL'S BEEN WORKING ON HIS STANCE IN QUITE SOME TIME. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE STATE NEEDS TO DO. TO BE ABLE TO ADVANCE AND SOLUTIONS TO THE LESSONS LEARNED OF THE CHALLENGES THAT WE'RE FACED WITH MISS WRITINGS. I THANK YOU MR CHAIR ON. I THINK I'M LEARNING FROM THAT COUNCIL EXPERIENCE NOT FEDERAL EXPERIENCE- THE STATE CAN TAKE AWAY SORT OF STUFF SOME PROCESS RECOMMENDATIONS IN SALCOMBE RECOMMENDATIONS I THINK ANYTHING THAT THE STATE HAS TO THINK ABOUT THIS IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO INCLUDE STAKEHOLDERS- ONE OF OUR LESSONS LEARNED FROM THAT PROCESS WAS THE IMPORTANCE. OF BRINGING IN STAKEHOLDERS NOT ONLY ON FISHERMEN AND OTHER FOLKS ASSOCIATED WITH FISHERIES- BUT THINKING WIDER THAN THAT- AND MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE HAS THE ABILITY TO PARTICIPATE AND ADD THEIR POINT OF VIEW- OUTCOME LIES. I THINK THE COUNCIL AT THIS POINT IS ENTERTAINING A LOT OF REALLY GOOD IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO MAKE OUR FEDERAL FISHERIES READY FOR CLIMATE CHANGE ON A LOT OF THEM ARE ABOUT HOW CAN WE MAKE OUR SCIENCE AND DATA COLLECTION ROBUST. THINKING ABOUT THE- SUDDEN CHANGES THAT WE'RE SEEING FROM CLIMATE CHANGE- WHETHER THAT BE SOMETHING LIKE THE WARM BLOG OR SOCIAL CHANGE LIKE COATED- AND THEN THINKING ABOUT ONE OF THE THINGS WE CAN ACTUALLY DO FOR MANAGEMENT WHETHER THAT BE SOMETHING LIKE- REDOING OUR HARVESTING FOR RULES AND THINKING ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF CONSIDERING. CLIMATE AND REST- OR WHETHER IT BE SOMETHING EVEN LIKE THINKING. OKAY HOW DO WE INCLUDE THE RIGHT FOLKS IN THE ROOM WHEN WE'RE MAKING DECISIONS ABOUT THAT DO WE HAVE THE CAPACITY IN OUR DEPARTMENT TO HAVE KLEIN EXPERTS AND ECOSYSTEM EXPERTS- SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF GOOD IDEAS COMING I THINK THERE'S MORE TO COME- AND- IT'S. GREAT THAT THE STATE IS LEANING INTO THAT. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR FISH CONSERVATION MANAGER FROM THOSE CONCERT. I WANNA I FINALLY GO TO MR HEATLEY WHO. HE AND SO MANY OTHER. MERSHON RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN HAVE BEEN IMPACTED BY THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. OIL SPILL MR HEALY I WANNA GET YOUR TAKE DO YOU FEEL THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WAS PREPARED TO RESPOND- IN YOUR INITIAL COMMENTS YOU SAID THAT WAS- JOHNNY ON THE SPOT IN REGARDS A RESPONSE BUT WHERE YOU'RE DEEP CONCERN IS. LONG TERM IN THE IMPACTS LONG TERM ON THE ECONOMY AND ESPECIALLY- THE FISHERMEN MR HEALY I WANT WORDS IN HER MOUTH BUT I THINK WE'RE YOUR DEEP CONCERN IS ENSURING THAT THE STATE AND ALSO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A LONG TERM PLANS TO HELP COMPENSATE THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN ECONOMICALLY DAMAGED BY THIS BILL CORRECT MISTER HALEY. YES DEFINITELY I THINK THE BIG ROUGH FOR US DOWN HERE IS IT OBVIOUSLY ARE YOU ALREADY KNOW THAT IT WAS SAID IT STATED EARLIER EARLIER IN THE WEEK ARRIVES A LOT OF THIS DRIVER SO LIVELY HOOD FROM LOBSTER FISHING AND WHAT THAT MEANS THAT HALF WHAT WE CATCH COMES OUT THE FIRST FEW WEEKS OF THE SEASON IN OUR AREA MUST PACIFIC PLATE. SO IT DOESN'T NECESSARILY MEAN IF WE START LATER IN THE YEAR WE'RE GONNA ACTUALLY CASTLES LOSS OR SICK GOOD GONE SOMEPLACE ALSO MIGHT NOT EVEN WANT TO OFFER YOU GO IN THE TRASH BUT- AS FAR AS- OUR BIGGEST ROB WAS THE COMMUNICATION DEFICIT. HAVING HAVING AN OIL SPILL WE GOT A BIT. HAVING A CLOSURE AND I KNOW THAT IT WAS DYNAMIC IT WAS MOVING IN FLORIDA. AS IT WAS GOING BUT THERE WAS NO COMMUNICATION TO THE ACTUAL USERS IN THAT AREA. THERE SHOULD BE SOME TYPE OF PROTOCOL SET IN THE PLACE THAT THEY WERE NOTIFIED AS QUICKLY AS ANYTHING COULD BE. TRANSPIRED OR INFORMATION SHOULD BE GIVEN I MEAN IF THEY'RE GONNA CLOSE THE HARBOR WE SHOULD HAVE KNOWN IT. THEY BROUGHT THE BOOM DOWN THAT MORNING THEY PROBABLY DO THEY'RE GOING TO CLOSE THE HARBOR THAT INFORMATION SHOULD HAVE BEEN DISSEMINATED TO US SO THAT WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. NOT MOVE ARE TRAPPED IN THE AREAS THAT WE LOSE THEM IN THE SERVICE SINCE WE COULD NOT. GET OUT OF THE HARBOR WAS A HARD CLOSURE- WE'RE STILL WAITING. ANALYSIS OF THE ANIMALS TO BE ABLE TO SEE WHETHER OR NOT WHEN. REFER MY WE'RE GONNA OPEN A LOT OF US ARE IN LIMBO KNOWING NOT KNOWING WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO. WE START TRAPS IN THE WATER THAT WE'RE STILL TRYING TO MAINTAIN AND NOT LOSE- AS FAR AS- I DON'T. KNOW HOW TO ANSWER QUESTION BUT- YOU KNOW. I'LL LEAVE IT AT THAT IF YOU HAVE ANOTHER GUN ASKED AGAIN A DIFFERENT PART OF IT NO I APPRECIATE THAT MR HEALY AND AGAIN DO YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO IT MYSELF MR OPPENHEIM WHO IS OUR CHIEF CONSULTANT WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT YOU ARE GETTING WHAT YOU NEED FLEET IS GETTING WHAT YOU NEED THE RECREATIONAL FISHERMEN ARE GETTING WHAT YOU NEED REGARDING EVERY LONG TERM RECOVERY ESPECIALLY IN THE ECONOMICS OF IT AND AGAIN I THINK YOU WERE AT THE POINT FIRE FLOOD EARTHQUAKE FEDERAL STATE GOVERNMENT COMING UNIFIED- IN COMMAND TO BE ABLE TO HELP COMPENSATE FOLKS WHO'VE BEEN. ECONOMICALLY IMPACTED OR LOST THEIR HOME EXCEPT RUSSIA I THINK THAT WE NEED TO BE TO DO THAT AGAIN AS WELL WE DO THAT DURING I DO WHEN WE HAD THAT THAT- COMMERCIAL CRAB SEASON IT WAS CLOSED THAT IN THE AREA IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA SO I PROMISE YOU WILL BE FOLLOWING UP WITH YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER HEALY. I WANT TO SAY THANK YOU TO MISS WRITINGS MR HE THE MIST- FORMER FELT- AS WELL AS YOUR CONROY AT FOR THEIR EXCELLENT TESTIMONY.

AND I'M ALSO A MEMBER OF THE DUNGENESS CRAB FISHING- WORKING GROUP. WE ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT SB EIGHTY- CONGRADULATIONS TO- TO YOU- MISTER SENATOR FOR THAT- HELPFUL AND BY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION- WE WANTED TO- COMMENDED THE INDUSTRY AND THE DEPARTMENT FOR. OTHER GRANT PROGRAM DOES SEEM TO BE- EXTREMELY SUCCESSFULIN REDUCING WELL ENTANGLEMENTS THE SHOULD BE. THIS IS RECOGNIZED BY THE CONSERVATION COMMUNITY AND SHOULD BE FURTHER RECOGNIZING KNOWLEDGE BY THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHERS- PARTICULARLY- KNOWLEDGE IN THE INDUSTRY SURVEYS. OF THE FUNDING BY THE OCEAN PROTECTION COUNCIL. TO GET KEY DATA TO INFORM THE RAMP PROGRAM- UNDER THE RAMP PROGRAM- WE'RE VERY INTERESTED IN ALTERNATIVE GEARS INCLUDING POP UP FISHING GEAR. WE'RE MAKING SOME MICHAEL THOUGHT PROGRESS IN MONTEREY BAY AND HOPEFUL TO SUBMIT. YOUR AUTHORIZATION PROPOSAL FOR APPROVAL THIS SPRING. WE WANT TO THANK THE OPC A NATIONAL MARINE SANCTUARY FOUNDATION FOR THEIR WORK AS WELL. THE TRIALS. HOWEVER WE DO NOT SUPPORT- A FLEET WIDE POP UP YOUR ROPE WITH YOUR MANDATE- WE DO SUPPORT AUTHORIZATION HOWEVER SO THAT- FISHERMEN. CAN CONTINUE TO FISH UNDER INCREASING TANGLE AT RISK WHEN IT'S ELEVATED- FOR THOSE FISHERMEN WHO VOLUNTARILY CHOOSE TO USE THAT PARTICULARLY IN EXTENDING THE SPRING SEASON- SO WE WE'RE- WE SEE TIME RELEASE POPS UP POP UP HERE AS A LOW COST ENTRY LEVEL APPROACH TO PROVIDING OPPORTUNITIES TO.
