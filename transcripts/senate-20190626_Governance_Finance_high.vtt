ANOTHER PRACTICAL EFFECT OF

ADDRESSING AN INEQUITY -- AND

00:04:31.337 --> 00:04:33.373
THE SECONDIS REESTABLISHING

00:04:33.439 --> 00:04:34.574
WHAT IS -- WHAT WE PREFER

00:04:34.641 --> 00:04:36.909
PREVIOUSLY HAD BEEN GOOD POLICY --

00:04:36.976 --> 00:04:38.578
IN THIS STATE A LOT OF IT FORMED

00:04:38.645 --> 00:04:40.380
BY THIS COMMITTEE IN THE PAST

00:04:40.446 --> 00:04:42.215
RELATED TO ANNEXATION ABOUT HOW

00:04:43.583 --> 00:04:45.218
FORWARD.

00:04:45.284 --> 00:04:46.886
SO IN TERMS OF THE INEQUITY ON

00:04:46.953 --> 00:04:49.288
IS THE AUTHOR SAID -- THERE WERE

00:04:49.355 --> 00:04:51.324
A A MANY COMMUNITIES THAT -- IN

00:04:51.391 --> 00:04:52.959

INHABITED AREAS OFTEN THESE

AREAS -- MAYBE HAVE -- THEIR

00:05:03.503 --> 00:05:04.470
COUNTY ON A CORPORATE OR IS THEY

00:05:04.537 --> 00:05:05.405
MIGHT HAVE LESS -- ADEQUATE

00:05:05.471 --> 00:05:08.007
INFRASTRUCTURE -- IN SERVICES

00:05:08.074 --> 00:05:08.941
AND SO BY BRINGING THESE

00:05:09.008 --> 00:05:11.310
COMMUNITIES -- INTO THE CITY AND

00:05:11.377 --> 00:05:13.346
SERVING THEM THAT THE CITY WOULD

00:05:13.413 --> 00:05:14.580
BE TAKING ON ADDITIONAL SERVICE

00:05:14.647 --> 00:05:16.115
RESPONSIBILITIES BUT ALSO

00:05:16.182 --> 00:05:18.384
PROVIDING HAVE SERVICES TO THE

00:05:18.451 --> 00:05:18.918
RESIDENT.

00:05:18.985 --> 00:05:21.487
THAT'S CONSISTENT WITH LOTS OF

00:05:21.554 --> 00:05:27.460
CORE OF OTHER POLICIES A STATUS

00:05:27.527 --> 00:05:29.729
VOTERS ON RELATED TO TRYING TO

00:05:29.796 --> 00:05:30.697
IMPROVE OUR WATER QUALITY OF

00:05:30.763 --> 00:05:32.131
SERVICES TO UNINCORPORATED AREAS

00:05:32.198 --> 00:05:33.466
DEALING WITH THE ISSUES WITH

00:05:33.533 --> 00:05:34.500
DISADVANTAGED ON A CORPORATE

00:05:34.567 --> 00:05:35.568
REYES X. ULTRA.

00:05:35.635 --> 00:05:36.469
SO THOSE CITIES ONE OUT IN OUR

00:05:36.536 --> 00:05:37.637
OPINION DID THE RIGHT POLICY

00:05:37.704 --> 00:05:38.538
THING BY BY BRINGING IN IN

00:05:38.604 --> 00:05:39.839
SERVING THESE AREAS AND IN IN

00:05:39.906 --> 00:05:40.907
PART OF THE WAY THOSE PENCIL OUT

00:05:40.973 --> 00:05:42.709
WAS IN RELIANCE UPON THESE

00:05:42.775 --> 00:05:44.444
REVENUES THAT THAT EXISTED.

00:05:44.510 --> 00:05:46.879
SO -- AS THE AUTHOR SAID A BILL

00:05:46.946 --> 00:05:48.981
WENT THROUGH NO HEARINGS NOTHING --

00:05:49.048 --> 00:05:51.284
WIPED OUT THOSE THOSE FUNDS AND

00:05:51.350 --> 00:05:52.919
SOME OF OF OUR CITIES FONTANA

00:05:52.985 --> 00:05:54.787
AND OTHERS LOST A SIGNIFICANT

00:05:54.854 --> 00:05:56.222
AMOUNT OF MONEY OF THAT THAT WAS

00:05:56.289 --> 00:05:57.256
SUPPOSED TO BE THERE TO SERVE

00:05:57.323 --> 00:05:58.558
THOSE COMMUNITIES.

00:05:58.624 --> 00:06:00.259
I WOULD JUST POINT OUT ANOTHER

00:06:00.326 --> 00:06:02.361
CITY THAT IS -- WOULD

00:06:02.428 --> 00:06:02.995
SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED WAS THE

00:06:03.062 --> 00:06:05.498
CITY OF CHICO -- WHICH IT HAD IT

00:06:05.565 --> 00:06:06.766
HAD A LOT OF UNINCORPORATED

00:06:06.833 --> 00:06:08.468
ISLANDS WITHIN THE CITY AND I

00:06:08.534 --> 00:06:09.736
THINK IN THE PAST WAS ACTUALLY

00:06:09.802 --> 00:06:11.938
ARE ECOGNIZED AND PRAISED.

00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:13.506
FOR WORKING WITH LASKO IN AND

00:06:13.573 --> 00:06:16.109
BRING IN A LOT OF THESE ISLANDS

00:06:16.175 --> 00:06:17.276
AND AS YOU ALL KNOW -- CHICO'S

00:06:17.343 --> 00:06:18.978
BASICALLY THE BASE CAMP FOR THE

00:06:19.045 --> 00:06:20.847
THE RIGHT REBUILDING OF PARADISE

00:06:20.913 --> 00:06:22.448
AND IS IN CURRENT A LOT OF

00:06:22.515 --> 00:06:24.117
ADDITIONAL A COST ASSOCIATED

00:06:24.183 --> 00:06:25.585
WITH SO THE THE IF THE FIXING

00:06:25.651 --> 00:06:28.154
THIS INEQUITY IS IS A IS A GOOD

00:06:28.221 --> 00:06:29.555
GOOD THING IT NEEDS TO BE DONE.

00:06:29.622 --> 00:06:31.224
I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THAT THE

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:32.859
LEGISLATURE ALSO FIXED -- THERE

00:06:32.925 --> 00:06:35.128
WERE FOUR INCORPORATED CITIES

00:06:35.194 --> 00:06:36.863
THAT ALSO HAD BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY

00:06:36.929 --> 00:06:38.131
HARM THE LEGISLATURE FIX THAT

00:06:38.197 --> 00:06:43.269
ISSUE TWO YEARS AGO THIS IS THE

00:06:43.336 --> 00:06:46.339
SAME FIX.

00:06:46.405 --> 00:06:47.707
I ENDED UP FOR FOR THE CITY'S AT

00:06:47.774 --> 00:06:49.408
ANNEX THE SECOND THING I WOULD

00:06:49.475 --> 00:06:52.578
SAY IS ON ON ON ON YES I KNOW

WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE CITIES

00:14:10.583 --> 00:14:12.451
WHO HAVE ALREADY DONE THE WORK

00:14:12.518 --> 00:14:13.285

AND WE DO HAVE A LIST OF THE ONE

00:14:29.902 --> 00:14:32.204
HUNDRED AND FORTY PLUS CITIES

00:14:32.271 --> 00:14:34.607

PAY THE BONDS.

00:14:57.329 --> 00:14:58.731

AND IT WAS TAKEN AWAY FROM US --

00:15:20.286 --> 00:15:21.520
SO IT WAS EXTREMELY AWKWARD

00:15:21.587 --> 00:15:22.421
BECAUSE ALL WE WERE DOING WAS

00:15:22.488 --> 00:15:23.789

ACTIVE INTENT. FOR A

00:21:14.272 --> 00:21:15.007
CONTRIBUTION.

00:21:15.073 --> 00:21:17.142
THAT CURRENT LAW ALLOWS FOR THE

00:21:17.209 --> 00:21:18.644
DISALLOWANCE OF A CHARITABLE

00:21:18.710 --> 00:21:19.311

00:21:20.245 --> 00:21:21.380
SO.

00:21:21.446 --> 00:21:23.081
IF IF IF ONE OF THESE

00:21:23.148 --> 00:21:26.318
INDIVIDUALS AS EITHER --

00:21:26.385 --> 00:21:28.687

THROUGH TRIAL BAR IS FOUND

00:21:29.921 --> 00:21:33.025
GUILTY AFTER TRIAL -- AND THEY

WITH THIS BILL BE NECESSARY OR

00:21:40.666 --> 00:21:42.467

WANT TO DO HERE.

00:21:48.440 --> 00:21:50.042
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION AND THAT

00:21:50.108 --> 00:21:51.109
REALLY SPEAKS MORE THE INTENT --

00:21:51.176 --> 00:21:53.211
UNDER CURRENT LAW FRANCHISE TAX

00:21:53.278 --> 00:21:56.581
BOARD DOES HAVE THE AUTHORITY.

00:21:56.648 --> 00:21:59.584
TO CORRECT THE TAX BENEFIT OR

00:21:59.651 --> 00:22:01.853

00:22:03.155 --> 00:22:05.590
UNDERLYING CODE.

00:22:05.657 --> 00:22:06.792
SO THERE'S NOT A BILL OF TODAY

00:22:06.858 --> 00:22:08.026
WHERE YOU HAVE A TWENTY YEAR

00:22:08.093 --> 00:22:10.295
STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS IS THAT

00:22:10.362 --> 00:22:11.129
CORRECT.

00:22:11.196 --> 00:22:14.232

00:37:44.228 --> 00:37:47.898
REVENUES -- BUT IT ISN'T GOING

00:37:47.965 --> 00:37:49.500
TO PERHAPS THE CITY WHERE THE

00:37:49.567 --> 00:37:51.202
PURCHASER AND SO -- THERE

00:37:51.268 --> 00:37:52.236
THERE'S A LOT OF RETAIL ACTIVITY

00:37:52.303 --> 00:37:53.004
IN ORANGE COUNTY BUT A

00:37:53.070 --> 00:37:55.139
NEIGHBORING COUNTIES GETTING THE

00:37:55.206 --> 00:37:55.439
SALES TAX.

00:37:55.506 --> 00:38:00.244
AND I THINK I IT IT PUTS -- AN

00:38:00.311 --> 00:38:02.446
AWKWARD COMPOUNDED INTO --

00:38:02.513 --> 00:38:03.547
CITIES QUé AND COMPETING

00:38:03.614 --> 00:38:06.183
AGAINST EACH OTHER TO GET THESE

00:38:06.250 --> 00:38:07.184
WAREHOUSES SO I APPRECIATE THIS

00:38:07.251 --> 00:38:09.387
BILL BECAUSE I THOUGHT THAT --

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.955
SENATE BILL FIVE THIRTY ONE BY

00:38:11.022 --> 00:38:12.323
GLAZER WAS A GOOD.

00:38:12.390 --> 00:38:15.760
BILL AS WELL -- BUT IF WE'RE ALL

00:38:15.826 --> 00:38:17.228
GONNA START COMPETING FOR SALES

00:38:17.294 --> 00:38:18.629
TAX GENERATORS WE KIND OF GET

00:38:18.696 --> 00:38:20.498
BLINDED. TO WHAT'S REALLY

00:38:20.564 --> 00:38:21.599
HAPPENING AND I THINK ONCE THE

00:38:21.666 --> 00:38:24.268
LEAGUE OF CITIES REALIZES THAT A

00:38:24.335 --> 00:38:27.271
LOT OF THEIR MEMBERS ARE NOT

00:38:27.338 --> 00:38:27.905
GETTING THE REVENUES THEY SHOULD

00:38:27.972 --> 00:38:29.106
BE GETTING.

00:38:29.173 --> 00:38:31.642
BECAUSE IT'S BEING.

00:38:31.709 --> 00:38:34.945
CENTERED SOMEWHERE ELSE -- THEN

00:38:35.012 --> 00:38:36.280
THEN IMAGES TO A BALLOT MEASURE.

00:38:36.347 --> 00:38:37.381
AND THEN ALL THE CITIES THAT

00:38:37.448 --> 00:38:39.083
GAVE SUBSIDIES ARE GONNA FIND

00:38:39.150 --> 00:38:40.418
THEMSELVES.

00:38:40.484 --> 00:38:42.319
LOSING THE SALES TAX REVENUE

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:43.020
THEREFORE PART COMING UP

00:38:43.087 --> 00:38:44.522
NEGATIVE PAYING OUT MORE IN

00:38:44.588 --> 00:38:46.424
SUBSIDIES THAN THEY'RE GETTING

00:38:46.490 --> 00:38:47.291
AND SALES TAX BENEFITS I'M.

00:38:47.358 --> 00:38:49.093
I'M CONCERNED ABOUT THAT SO I

00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.461
APPRECIATE THE BILL I APPRECIATE

00:38:50.528 --> 00:38:52.396
CERTAIN THE LABOR COMPONENT BUT

00:38:52.463 --> 00:38:54.432
I'M I'M CONCERNED LONG TERM OR

00:38:54.498 --> 00:38:57.068
WHAT HAPPENS TO THESE CITIES --

00:38:57.134 --> 00:38:58.936
SHOULD.

00:38:59.003 --> 00:38:59.937
THE WHOLE DYNAMIC CHANGED BY

00:39:00.004 --> 00:39:02.306
DEVELOPING AGENCIES DISAPPEARED

00:39:02.373 --> 00:39:04.475

I GAVE A LIST ALREADY HAVE ALL

00:39:05.176 --> 00:39:06.110
THE THE FUNNY THING IS TO GO ON

00:39:06.177 --> 00:39:07.578
A GOVERNMENT WHERE PEOPLE THINK

00:39:07.645 --> 00:39:08.446
THEY'RE DOING A GREAT THING FOR

00:39:08.512 --> 00:39:09.080
THEIR CITY.

00:39:09.146 --> 00:39:10.247

00:40:25.923 --> 00:40:26.457
SUPPORTING AYE I GUESS SORT OF

00:40:26.524 --> 00:40:28.259
SPONSORING FIVE THIRTY ONE

00:40:28.325 --> 00:40:29.827
BECAUSE WE HAD A DAY INTENSIVE

00:40:29.894 --> 00:40:30.394
POLICY DISCUSSION WITHIN THE

00:40:30.461 --> 00:40:31.796
LEAGUE ABOUT THAT ISSUE AND

00:40:31.862 --> 00:40:32.496
ESPECIALLY ABOUT SOME OF THE THE

00:40:32.563 --> 00:40:33.430
THE THE GROWTH OF INTERNET AND

00:40:33.497 --> 00:40:35.099
SOME OF THE ISSUES AND SO.

00:40:35.166 --> 00:40:36.667
THAT'S WHY THAT BILL WOULD BE

00:40:36.734 --> 00:40:37.935
AND THESE AGREEMENTS GOING

00:40:38.002 --> 00:40:39.470
FORWARD WE SUPPORT THAT BUILDS

00:40:39.537 --> 00:40:41.238
IN THE ASSEMBLY.

00:40:41.305 --> 00:40:43.407
THIS ISSUE IF YOU TAKE THAT BILL

00:40:43.474 --> 00:40:44.308
WOULD PUT THAT BILL ASIDE AND

00:40:44.375 --> 00:40:45.142
SAY THAT GOES THROUGH THE

00:40:45.209 --> 00:40:46.277
GOVERNOR SIGNS IT.

00:40:46.343 --> 00:40:48.279
AND THE QUESTION IS WHERE WE

00:40:48.345 --> 00:40:49.380
HAVE IN A WAREHOUSE SCHEMA WHERE

00:40:49.446 --> 00:40:51.315
A CITY WITH A WAREHOUSE IN THIS

00:40:51.382 --> 00:40:52.683
INSTANCE GO THROUGH ALL THE

00:40:52.750 --> 00:40:54.151
HOOPS AND HURDLES THAT TAT THIS

00:40:54.218 --> 00:40:55.186
BILL REQUIRES.

00:40:55.252 --> 00:40:56.821
THIS BILL REQUIRES UNDER

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:58.689
EXISTING LAW IF YOU HAVE GIVEN

00:40:58.756 --> 00:41:00.057
ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS IN OF YOU

00:41:00.124 --> 00:41:01.559
HAVE TO HAVE A PUBLIC HEARING

00:41:01.625 --> 00:41:02.660
AND THEN WHAT YOU GIVE THAT

00:41:02.726 --> 00:41:08.332
INSTEAD OF YOU HAVE TO HAVE A

00:41:08.399 --> 00:41:10.034
REPORT EVERY FIVE YEARS.

00:41:10.100 --> 00:41:11.335
THIS BILL REQUIRES MUCH MORE

00:41:11.402 --> 00:41:12.503
DETAIL RELATED TO A WAREHOUSE

00:41:12.570 --> 00:41:14.104
AND ALSO REQUIRES ANNUAL PUBLIC

00:41:14.171 --> 00:41:15.739
HEARINGS IN ANNUAL REPORTS

00:41:15.806 --> 00:41:17.474
REPORTS TO GO BUSINESS AND OTHER

00:41:17.541 --> 00:41:19.310
THINGS BUT NOT KNOW WHETHER --

00:41:19.376 --> 00:41:20.444
ENTITY HOUSE TO DO IN FACT I

00:41:20.511 --> 00:41:22.012
THINK IT PROBABLY GOES FURTHER

00:41:22.079 --> 00:41:23.681
THAN THE STATE'S WHEN GOKU'S

00:41:23.747 --> 00:41:25.316
GIVES OUT A CALIFORNIA COMPETES

00:41:25.382 --> 00:41:26.083
CREDITS.

00:41:26.150 --> 00:41:27.084
I DON'T THINK THERE HAVE AN

00:41:27.151 --> 00:41:28.552
ANNUAL PUBLIC HEARINGS ON ON

00:41:28.619 --> 00:41:32.156
THERE IT'S AND SO IT GOES TO

00:41:32.223 --> 00:41:33.023
FOUR AND ENDED IT SINGLES OUT

00:41:33.090 --> 00:41:34.325
THESE COMMUNITIES.

00:41:34.391 --> 00:41:35.993
THE SALES TAX ISSUE WE WOULD

00:41:36.060 --> 00:41:37.161
ARGUE HAS BEEN ADDRESSED IN

00:41:37.228 --> 00:41:39.063
THERE -- FOR THE COMMUNITIES

00:41:39.129 --> 00:41:41.165
OUGHT TO HAVE FLEXIBILITY TO THE

00:41:41.232 --> 00:41:42.233
EXTENT THEY'RE USING THEIR OWN

00:41:42.299 --> 00:41:43.434
REVENUES.

00:41:43.500 --> 00:41:45.169
THE IN A AND I'LL JUST ADD

00:41:45.236 --> 00:41:45.970
THOUGH JUST I THINK IT'S CLEAR.

00:41:46.036 --> 00:41:47.471
THERE'S A DISTINCT DIFFERENCE

00:41:47.538 --> 00:41:50.741
BETWEEN CENTER -- GLAZIERS BILL --

00:41:50.808 --> 00:41:53.210
AS WELL AS THIS BILL THIS BILL

00:41:53.277 --> 00:41:56.146
IS NOT JUST FOCUS ON SALES TAX

00:41:56.213 --> 00:41:58.015
SALES TAXES FOCUS ON SB FIVE

00:41:58.082 --> 00:41:59.516
THIRTY ONE WHICH IS GLAZERS BILL --

00:41:59.583 --> 00:42:02.353
AND THIS BILL IS ON OTHER TYPES

00:42:02.419 --> 00:42:05.522
OF SUBSIDIES SO IT'S THERE ARE

00:42:05.589 --> 00:42:06.290
SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THAT.

00:42:06.357 --> 00:42:11.996
PERSON NEVER WOULD YOU LIKE TO

00:42:12.062 --> 00:42:13.464
BE ABLE TO RESPOND AT ALL.

00:42:13.530 --> 00:42:14.331
SO I AM THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER THAT

00:42:14.398 --> 00:42:15.266
REPRESENTS THE CITY OF MORENO

00:42:15.332 --> 00:42:16.333
VALLEY AS WELL AS THE CITY OF

00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:17.534
RIVERSIDE.

00:42:17.601 --> 00:42:21.372
AND THE CITY OF PARIS -- AND

00:42:21.438 --> 00:42:22.373
I'VE.

00:42:22.439 --> 00:42:23.507
PRESENT THIS BILL BECAUSE I

00:42:23.574 --> 00:42:25.776
AGREE.

00:42:25.843 --> 00:42:27.311
WITH CENTER MORE LOCK THAT THE

00:42:27.378 --> 00:42:30.314
CITIZENS OF A COMMUNITY SHOULD

00:42:30.381 --> 00:42:32.449
VERY WELL KNOW WHERE THEIR TAX

00:42:32.516 --> 00:42:34.618
DOLLARS ARE GOING.

00:42:34.685 --> 00:42:37.922
I I I BELIEVE THAT.

00:42:37.988 --> 00:42:39.290
ALSO  THINK CENTER MORE LIKE

00:42:39.356 --> 00:42:41.358
SAID THAT MANY TIMES WAREHOUSES

00:42:41.425 --> 00:42:42.660
COMING IN AND YOU COMMUNITY MAKE

00:42:42.726 --> 00:42:44.228
PROMISES THAT ARE NOT.

00:42:44.295 --> 00:42:46.797
A DELIVERED ON JOBS OR THE

00:42:46.864 --> 00:42:48.198
REVENUE THAT THEY'RE THEY WOULD

00:42:48.265 --> 00:42:50.334
CREATE OR THE KIND OF JOBS THAT

00:42:50.401 --> 00:42:52.770
THEY CREATE.

00:42:52.836 --> 00:42:53.971
AND FOR THAT REASON I THINK THIS

00:42:54.038 --> 00:42:56.173
WEEK WE NEED THIS BILL I ASK FOR

00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.975

AB THE SOLUTION. TO ALTERNATIVES

00:43:15.492 --> 00:43:16.660
HERE.

00:43:16.727 --> 00:43:17.761
IS WHAT WE'RE DOING IS WE'RE

00:43:17.828 --> 00:43:19.530
DANCING AROUND THE PROBLEM.

00:43:19.596 --> 00:43:22.266
THE PROBLEM IS BRADLEY BURNS.

00:43:22.333 --> 00:43:23.567
WE'VE CREATED TAX STRUCTURE

00:43:23.634 --> 00:43:24.635
CENTERS I MEAN GOVERNOR

00:43:24.702 --> 00:43:26.303
SCHWARZENEGGER TRIED TO DEAL

00:43:26.370 --> 00:43:28.339
WITH THIS AND WASN'T SUCCESSFUL --

00:43:28.405 --> 00:43:30.741
BECAUSE WE INCENTIVIZE BIG BOX

00:43:30.808 --> 00:43:31.675

00:43:31.742 --> 00:43:33.410
BIG CITIES LIKE LOS ANGELES STEP

00:43:33.477 --> 00:43:34.979
SMALL CITIES AROUND OF TO GET

00:43:35.045 --> 00:43:36.680
THE BENEFIT OF THIS EXTRA PENNY

00:43:36.747 --> 00:43:38.082
ON SALES TAX OR AUTO MALLS AND

00:43:38.148 --> 00:43:39.950
THE LIKE.

00:43:40.017 --> 00:43:41.251
IS IT A HOUSING WE TRIED TO DO

00:43:41.318 --> 00:43:42.152
THAT AND COULD WIN THAT.

00:43:42.219 --> 00:43:43.387
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST EITHER A

00:43:43.454 --> 00:43:44.621
ELIMINATE BRADLEY BURNS THAT

00:43:44.688 --> 00:43:46.290
STOP STOPS THE PROBLEM IN THE IN

00:43:46.357 --> 00:43:47.191

NOTHING TO OFFER WHEN YOU DON'T

00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:51.228
HAVE THAT MONEY OR BE DO WHAT

00:43:51.295 --> 00:43:53.030

00:43:53.097 --> 00:43:54.698
AND USE THAT BRADLEY BURNS MONEY

FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING WHICH IS

00:43:56.734 --> 00:43:57.768
ONE OF THE REASONS WHY WE HAVE A

00:43:57.835 --> 00:44:00.037
HOUSING PROBLEM WE HAVE BECAUSE

00:44:00.104 --> 00:44:01.271
LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WANT THE

00:44:01.338 --> 00:44:02.239
MONEY.

00:44:02.306 --> 00:44:04.141

00:44:04.208 --> 00:44:04.908
FOR TO PAY SUBSIDIZED Là

00:44:04.975 --> 00:44:06.510

BIG BOX RETAILERS AUTO MALLS DO

00:44:10.447 --> 00:44:11.715

00:44:11.782 --> 00:44:13.050
TO INDUCE A BILL AND JUST GET

00:44:13.117 --> 00:44:14.251

FIRST PARAGRAPH.

01:01:15.271 --> 01:01:17.340

AIR RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE

01:01:47.804 --> 01:01:48.971
REASON WHY WE DO THAT.

01:01:49.038 --> 01:01:50.573
IS BECAUSE WE SHOULD ALWAYS HAVE

01:01:50.640 --> 01:01:51.841
THE INDIVIDUAL.

01:01:51.908 --> 01:01:53.910

OF THE FIVE COUNTY BOARD

01:02:08.391 --> 01:02:09.492
DISTRICTS.

01:02:09.559 --> 01:02:11.194
THAT WOULD THEN BE APPOINTED BY

THE CITY SELECTION COMMITTEE.

01:02:14.297 --> 01:02:16.132
THE THREE PUBLIC BOARD MEMBERS

01:02:16.199 --> 01:02:17.867
WOULD BE APPOINTED -- IT COULD

01:02:17.934 --> 01:02:19.869
BE THROUGH AN AD HOC OF THE

01:02:19.936 --> 01:02:20.937

THERE IS NO FORMAL DEFINITION --

01:02:36.319 --> 01:02:38.488
AND WE WE THINK WE'VE HIT THE

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:39.989
SWEET SPOT.

01:02:40.056 --> 01:02:41.624

01:02:51.767 --> 01:02:53.202
CAN PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE DETAIL

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.737
BUT YOU MIGHT BE LOOKING.

01:02:54.804 --> 01:02:55.304
FOR I CAN'T WRITE THE CODE

SECTION SORRY I DON'T HAVE IT IN

01:02:56.639 --> 01:02:58.074
FRONT OF ME BUT I DO -- KNOW

01:02:58.141 --> 01:02:59.142
THAT EACH OF THE LARGE DISTRICTS

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.776
HAS A DIFFERENT COMPOSITION BUT

01:03:00.843 --> 01:03:03.379
THEY GENERALLY HAVE THE SAME

01:03:03.446 --> 01:03:05.281
IDEA OF HAVING PUBLIC MEMBERS

01:03:05.348 --> 01:03:07.984
MEMBERS FROM EACH OF THE CITIES

01:03:08.050 --> 01:03:09.452

ONE OF THE LARGE DISTRICTS BUT

01:03:21.664 --> 01:03:24.233
ALL OF THEM ARE DIVERSE AND HAVE

01:03:24.300 --> 01:03:25.234
A HAVE A DIFFERENT KIND OF

01:03:25.301 --> 01:03:26.969

SECOND LARGEST A REGION IN THE

STATE AND YET WE OPERATE

01:03:36.612 --> 01:03:37.480
CURRENTLY AS ONE OF THE SMALL

01:03:37.547 --> 01:03:39.382
COUNTIES AND THAT'S NOT WORKING

FORMAT AND THAT'S SO I GUESS THE

01:04:01.003 --> 01:04:03.005

CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE

01:06:36.559 --> 01:06:37.193
CURRENT STATE LAW REQUIRES THAT

01:06:37.259 --> 01:06:38.327
WHEN A BOND IS APPROVED BY

01:06:38.394 --> 01:06:38.961
VOTERS.

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.096
THAT THE ABOUT BALLOT --

01:06:40.162 --> 01:06:40.963
STATEMENT NEXT TO THE BOX WE

01:06:41.030 --> 01:06:42.098
CHECK YES OR NO TO VOTE INCLUDES

01:06:42.164 --> 01:06:42.732
AN ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:43.866
PROPERTY TAX INCREASE THAT WILL

01:06:43.933 --> 01:06:45.134
BE REQUIRED TO SERVICE THAT BOND.

01:06:45.201 --> 01:06:46.001
CURRENTLY STATE LAW REQUIRES

01:06:46.068 --> 01:06:47.536
THAT TO BE EXPRESSED IN TERMS OF

01:06:47.603 --> 01:06:49.238
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS OF DOLLARS

01:06:49.305 --> 01:06:51.273
PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF ASSESSED

01:06:51.340 --> 01:06:51.507
VALUE.

01:06:51.574 --> 01:06:53.109
THIS BILL AB SIX TEN WOULD

01:06:53.175 --> 01:06:54.276
SIMPLY CHANGE THAT TO DOLLARS

01:06:54.343 --> 01:06:55.878
POORER THOUSAND DOLLARS OF

01:06:55.945 --> 01:06:57.079
ASSESSED VALUE.

01:06:57.146 --> 01:06:58.247
THIS IS -- AN IMPORTANT TOOL FOR

01:06:58.314 --> 01:07:00.149
DECREASING VOTER CONFUSION AND

01:07:00.216 --> 01:07:01.884
HELPING PEOPLE TO DO THE MATH

01:07:01.951 --> 01:07:02.852
BECAUSE THE AVERAGE HOUSE IN

01:07:02.918 --> 01:07:04.186
CALIFORNIA IS CURRENTLY WORTH

01:07:04.253 --> 01:07:06.922
MORE THAN FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:07:06.989 --> 01:07:08.791
DOLLARS SO -- THIS BILLABLE

01:07:08.858 --> 01:07:10.226
WHERE HAS OPTED OPPOSITION AND

01:07:10.292 --> 01:07:11.394
WHAT ADDRESS A COUPLE OF THE

01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:12.728
POINTS IN THE OPPOSITION LETTERS

01:07:12.795 --> 01:07:14.296
THAT I'M SURE YOU'VE READ.

01:07:14.363 --> 01:07:15.998
FIRST OF ALL -- THERE HAVE BEEN

01:07:16.065 --> 01:07:17.266
CLAIMS MADE THAT THIS ACTUALLY

01:07:17.333 --> 01:07:19.168
INCREASES VOTER CONFUSION OF

01:07:19.235 --> 01:07:20.436
ALTHOUGH NO ONE HAS TOLD ME

01:07:20.503 --> 01:07:21.871
EXACTLY WHY THEY FEEL THIS WAY

01:07:21.937 --> 01:07:23.806
BUT LET ME TELL YOU A SIMPLE

01:07:23.873 --> 01:07:25.574
EXAMPLE WHY I BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:07:25.641 --> 01:07:26.375
ACTUALLY DECREASES VOTER

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:28.010
CONFUSION.

01:07:28.077 --> 01:07:29.645
SO A TYPICAL BY BOB BALLOT

01:07:29.712 --> 01:07:31.380
MEASURE -- FOR APPROVAL OF NEW

01:07:31.447 --> 01:07:33.282
BOND MIGHT SAY THAT THIS BOND

01:07:33.349 --> 01:07:34.750
WILL INCREASE TAXES BY EIGHT

01:07:34.817 --> 01:07:36.218
CENTS PER HUNDRED DOLLARS OF

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:37.686
ASSESSED VALUE SO PRETEND THAT

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:39.288
YOU HAVE A HOUSE THAT'S WORTH.

01:07:39.355 --> 01:07:40.322
FOUR HUNDRED AND TWENTY THOUSAND

01:07:40.389 --> 01:07:41.891
DOLLARS HOW WOULD YOU DO THE

01:07:41.957 --> 01:07:43.659
MATH TO FIGURE OUT WHAT YOUR TAX

01:07:43.726 --> 01:07:44.693
INCREASE WOULD BE.

01:07:44.760 --> 01:07:46.295
MAKING YOU THINK OF THE STEPS

01:07:46.362 --> 01:07:47.263
THAT YOU WOULD TAKE I'LL TELL

01:07:47.329 --> 01:07:47.797
YOU THE MAJORITY OF MY

01:07:47.863 --> 01:07:49.432
CONSTITUENTS COULD NOT COME UP

01:07:49.498 --> 01:07:50.566
WITH THOSE STEPS.

01:07:50.633 --> 01:07:51.667
BUT IF WE JUST SIMPLY EXPRESSED

01:07:51.734 --> 01:07:53.569
IT IN DOLLARS PER HUNDRED

01:07:53.636 --> 01:07:55.037
DOLLARS EXCESS VALUE THAT WOULD

01:07:55.104 --> 01:07:56.839
BE EIGHTY CENTS PER HUNDRED

01:07:56.906 --> 01:07:58.274
DOLLARS IT'S CLEAR TO PEOPLE IF

01:07:58.340 --> 01:07:59.375
THEY'RE FOUR HOUSES WORTH.

01:07:59.442 --> 01:08:00.576
BORDER TO TWENTY THOUSAND THEY

01:08:00.643 --> 01:08:07.416
WOULD JUST MULTIPLY BY FORD AND

01:08:07.483 --> 01:08:08.784
TWENTY ANOTHER.

01:08:08.851 --> 01:08:09.552
CONCERN HAS BEEN RAISED BY THE

01:08:09.618 --> 01:08:11.220
OPPOSITION IS THAT AND SOMETIMES

01:08:11.287 --> 01:08:12.221
IT'S RAISED EXPLICITLY AND

01:08:12.288 --> 01:08:12.888
SOMETIMES A SAID IMPLICITLY BUT

01:08:12.955 --> 01:08:13.489
ANOTHER CONCERN IS THAT THIS

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:14.156
WILL MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT. TO

01:08:14.223 --> 01:08:14.924
GET BONDS APPROVED BY VOTERS

01:08:14.990 --> 01:08:17.159
BECAUSE THE AMOUNT OF THE TAX

01:08:17.226 --> 01:08:19.361
INCREASE WILL LOOK BIGGER IF WE

01:08:19.428 --> 01:08:21.664
MULTIPLY BY TEN EXPRESS IT PER

01:08:21.730 --> 01:08:22.798
THOUSAND DOLLARS AND PERCENT OF

01:08:22.865 --> 01:08:23.265
PER HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:08:23.332 --> 01:08:24.500
HOWEVER I'D LIKE GIVEN THE

01:08:24.567 --> 01:08:26.335
SERGEANTS OF MATERIALS TO PASS

01:08:26.402 --> 01:08:27.503
AROUND TO YOU THAT SAYS THAT

01:08:27.570 --> 01:08:29.205
THAT IS ABSOLUTELY FALSE THERE'S

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.840
A SERIES OF ARTICLES IN THERE

01:08:30.906 --> 01:08:31.373
WITH CITATIONS.

01:08:31.440 --> 01:08:32.508
THE ACADEMIC LITERATURE THAT

01:08:32.575 --> 01:08:33.542
SHOW THAT WHEN VOTERS ARE

01:08:33.609 --> 01:08:36.378
CONFUSED ABOUT AN ISSUE

01:08:36.445 --> 01:08:37.413
INCLUDING HOW MUCH THEY'RE GOING

01:08:37.480 --> 01:08:39.148
TO HAVE TO PAY THEY'RE MUCH MORE

01:08:39.215 --> 01:08:40.850
LIKELY TO VOTE NO.

01:08:40.916 --> 01:08:42.785
THE TO VOTE YES AND SO I BELIEVE

01:08:42.852 --> 01:08:43.652
THAT BY DECREASING VOTER

01:08:43.719 --> 01:08:45.020
CONFUSION AND MAKING IT MORE

01:08:45.087 --> 01:08:46.088
CLEAR WHAT'S SOMETHING WILL COST

01:08:46.155 --> 01:08:47.389
THEM THEY WILL ACTUALLY BE MORE

01:08:47.456 --> 01:08:49.191
LIKELY TO APPROVE IT.

01:08:49.258 --> 01:08:49.825
THEN TO DISAPPROVE IT.

01:08:49.892 --> 01:08:51.794
SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER

ORGANIZATION YOU HAVE TWO

01:09:21.423 --> 01:09:22.358
MINUTES EACH.

01:09:22.424 --> 01:09:23.792
THE MORNING REBEKAH CURLY ON

01:09:23.859 --> 01:09:24.827
BEHALF OF THE COALITION PRODUCT

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.263
WITH SCHOOL HOUSING WE ARE

01:09:27.329 --> 01:09:27.630
OPPOSED.

01:09:27.696 --> 01:09:28.264
TO EIGHTY SIX TEN AM WE BELIEVE

01:09:28.330 --> 01:09:30.132
THAT THE CHANGE IS UNNECESSARY

01:09:30.199 --> 01:09:31.166
AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT IT COULD

01:09:31.233 --> 01:09:33.402
INCREASE VOTER CONFUSION OF THE

01:09:33.469 --> 01:09:34.370
QUESTION FOR ME IS REALLY WHAT

01:09:34.436 --> 01:09:36.238
PROBLEM ARE WE TRYING TO SOLVE

01:09:36.305 --> 01:09:37.673
AND WHAT IMPROVEMENT WITH THIS

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:38.474
REALLY MAKE.

01:09:38.541 --> 01:09:40.476
WE DO APPRECIATE TRANSPARENCY IN

01:09:40.543 --> 01:09:41.710
COMMUNICATING VERY CLEARLY WITH

01:09:41.777 --> 01:09:43.245
VOTERS THE IMPACT THAT A MEASURE

01:09:43.312 --> 01:09:44.847
MAY HAVE ON THEM THE TAX RATE

01:09:44.914 --> 01:09:45.748
STATEMENT IN THE VOTER

01:09:45.814 --> 01:09:47.016
INFORMATION GUIDE IS A GREAT

01:09:47.082 --> 01:09:48.684
PLACE TO DO THIS IT CONTAINS A

01:09:48.751 --> 01:09:50.152
LOT OF VERY.

01:09:50.219 --> 01:09:52.321
IMPORTANT INFORMATION.

01:09:52.388 --> 01:09:53.556
IF AB SIX TENNIS PASSED IT WILL

01:09:53.622 --> 01:09:54.957
BE THE ONLY PLACE THAT I KNOW OF

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:57.393
IN THE LAW WHERE WE ARE

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:59.128
EXPRESSING -- PROPERTY VALUES

01:09:59.194 --> 01:10:01.363
PER ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS RATHER

01:10:01.430 --> 01:10:03.866
THAN ONE HUNDRED DOLLARS.

01:10:03.933 --> 01:10:04.767
ASSESSED VALUATION VOTERS ARE

01:10:04.833 --> 01:10:05.701
REQUIRED O DO BASIC MATH IN

01:10:05.768 --> 01:10:07.436
EITHER CALCULATION AND TO

01:10:07.503 --> 01:10:08.470
PRECISELY DETERMINE THE

01:10:08.537 --> 01:10:10.839
ESTIMATED TAX INCREASE FOR THEIR

01:10:10.906 --> 01:10:12.308
PARTICULAR PROPERTY VALUE.

01:10:12.374 --> 01:10:13.609
UP BECAUSE OF THIS WE DON'T

01:10:13.676 --> 01:10:14.510
BELIEVE THAT A THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:10:14.577 --> 01:10:15.711
ACTUALLY IMPROVES THE

01:10:15.778 --> 01:10:17.846
CALCULATION AND ANYWAY IT'S THE

01:10:17.913 --> 01:10:20.215
EXACT SAME MATH PROBLEM -- YOU

01:10:20.282 --> 01:10:21.917
KNOW FIVE CENTS PER ONE HUNDRED

01:10:21.984 --> 01:10:23.619
DOLLARS UNDER CURRENT LAW OR

01:10:23.686 --> 01:10:25.187
FIFTY CENTS PER THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:10:25.254 --> 01:10:27.423
UNDER AB SIX TEN IT'S THE SAME

01:10:27.489 --> 01:10:28.324
MOUTH.

01:10:28.390 --> 01:10:29.158
ADDITIONALLY WE DO FEAR THAT

01:10:29.224 --> 01:10:30.960
MAKING THIS CHANGE IN THE TAX

01:10:31.026 --> 01:10:31.694
RATE STATEMENT COULD SET A

01:10:31.760 --> 01:10:33.362
PRECEDENT AND PROP FUTURE

01:10:33.429 --> 01:10:34.997
CHANGES ON THE BALLOT LABEL.

01:10:35.064 --> 01:10:36.065
GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT

01:10:36.131 --> 01:10:37.366
SCHOOLS AND OTHER LOCAL AGENCIES

01:10:37.433 --> 01:10:39.501
ARE FACING IN IMPLEMENTING OTHER

01:10:39.568 --> 01:10:42.037
RECENT ELECTIONS CODE CHANGES WE

01:10:42.104 --> 01:10:43.205
DO FEAR THAT SIX TEN COULD

01:10:43.272 --> 01:10:44.573
CREATE A SLIPPERY SLOPE.

01:10:44.640 --> 01:10:46.342
AN EVEN MORE CHALLENGES IN

01:10:46.408 --> 01:10:47.843
COMMUNICATING EFFECTIVELY WITH

01:10:47.910 --> 01:10:49.612

THE OF THE CALIFORNIA

01:10:55.618 --> 01:10:57.419
PROFESSIONAL FIREFIGHTERS I HAD

01:10:57.486 --> 01:10:58.287
A GOOD SENSE THE PREVIOUS

01:10:58.354 --> 01:10:59.521
WITNESS WOULD COVER ALL OF THE

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:01.290
ISSUES THAT WE ARE CONCERNED

01:11:01.357 --> 01:11:01.523
ABOUT.

01:11:01.590 --> 01:11:03.392
THE SEEMS TO INSERT VOTER

01:11:03.459 --> 01:11:04.226
CONFUSION TO IS A TACTIC

01:11:04.293 --> 01:11:05.461
TAXPAYERS MONEY TO CREATE A

01:11:05.527 --> 01:11:07.630
DIFFERENT STANDARD FOR LOCAL

01:11:07.696 --> 01:11:09.098
BALLOT MEASURES AND FOR TRYING

01:11:09.164 --> 01:11:10.599
TO DO ADVOCACY MATH HERE WE

01:11:10.666 --> 01:11:12.801
SHOULD JUST SAY IT -- SO WEIRD

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.303

QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS WE'RE NOW

01:11:22.177 --> 01:11:23.912
GOING TO OPEN UP ANYONE ELSE WHO

01:11:23.979 --> 01:11:29.218
MAY BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL IF

01:11:29.284 --> 01:11:29.852
YOU COULD PLEASE COME FOR THIS

01:11:29.918 --> 01:11:30.552
TIME.

01:11:30.619 --> 01:11:32.821
LAST CALL FOR OPPOSITION.

01:11:32.888 --> 01:11:33.422
ALL RIGHT WE'RE GONNA TURN IT

WILL OPEN UP FOR QUESTIONS OR

01:11:38.093 --> 01:11:38.661
COMMENTS.

01:11:38.727 --> 01:11:42.031
THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR SO AGAIN --

01:11:42.097 --> 01:11:42.898
IT'S EASY TO SAY THAT THIS

01:11:42.965 --> 01:11:44.433
INCREASES VOTER CONFUSION NO ONE

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.235
HAS SAID WHY THEY FEEL THIS

01:11:46.301 --> 01:11:47.336
INCREASES VOTER CONFUSION I

01:11:47.403 --> 01:11:49.405
THINK THE OPPOSITE IS TRUE.

01:11:49.471 --> 01:11:52.207
IT DECREASES VOTER CONFUSION.

01:11:52.274 --> 01:11:53.375
THE ASSERTION WAS MADE THAT IS

01:11:53.442 --> 01:11:54.343
THE SAME MATH PROBLEM WELL IT'S

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:55.711
ACTUALLY NOT YOU HAVE TO KNOW

01:11:55.778 --> 01:11:57.179
WHAT NUMBERS TO PUSH ON THE

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.313
CALCULATOR IF YOU USING ONE AND

01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.748
IF YOU CAN'T CONCEPTUALIZE.

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.317
WHAT NUMBERS TO PUSH THEN YOU

01:12:01.383 --> 01:12:01.950
DON'T HAVE THE TOOLS THAT YOU

01:12:02.017 --> 01:12:03.852
NEED TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THIS

01:12:03.919 --> 01:12:04.820
WOULD COST YOU?

01:12:04.887 --> 01:12:06.188
BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY EVEN

01:12:06.255 --> 01:12:07.456
IF WE ACCEPT THE FACT THAT IT'S

01:12:07.523 --> 01:12:08.891
THE SAME MATH PROBLEM IN MY

01:12:08.957 --> 01:12:11.226
BUSINESS.

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.795
WE HAVE.

01:12:12.861 --> 01:12:15.297
A LOT OF DATA THAT -- THE THE

01:12:15.364 --> 01:12:15.964
DETERMINES TO THAT WHEN WE HAVE

01:12:16.031 --> 01:12:17.433
A NEW CUSTOMER AND WE'RE TRYING

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:18.467
TO CONVINCE THAT CUSTOMER TO BUY

01:12:18.534 --> 01:12:20.069
OUR PRODUCTS EVERY STEP THAT WE

01:12:20.135 --> 01:12:21.670
REQUIRE THAT CUSTOMER TO TAKE

01:12:21.737 --> 01:12:22.805
MAKES IT LESS LIKELY THAT

01:12:22.871 --> 01:12:24.073
THEY'RE GOING TO PURCHASE.

01:12:24.139 --> 01:12:25.374
AND I THINK THAT'S THE SAME IS

01:12:25.441 --> 01:12:27.176
TRUE IN A SITUATION LIKE THIS

01:12:27.242 --> 01:12:28.510
WHEN YOU'RE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT.

01:12:28.577 --> 01:12:30.345
HOW MUCH OF BOND ISSUE IS GOING

01:12:30.412 --> 01:12:32.414
TO COST YOU SO EVEN IF?

01:12:32.481 --> 01:12:33.749
A VOTER IN BOTH CASES KNEW

01:12:33.816 --> 01:12:35.284
EXACTLY WHAT TO DO THEY WOULD

01:12:35.350 --> 01:12:36.752
HAVE TO PUSH AN EXTRA BUTTON ON

01:12:36.819 --> 01:12:38.287
THE CALCULATOR TO MAKETHE

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:39.388
CALCULATION UNDER THE CURRENT

01:12:39.455 --> 01:12:40.022
STAY LOCKED.

01:12:40.089 --> 01:12:41.690
DOWN UNDER THE PROPOSED CHANGES

01:12:41.757 --> 01:12:44.193
MADE BY A. B..

01:12:44.259 --> 01:12:50.165
SIX TEN AND ABOUT WHAT LEGAL

01:12:50.232 --> 01:12:50.866
LASTLY JUST ONE LET ME JUST SAY

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:52.301
THAT -- THE MORE TRANSPARENCY

01:12:52.367 --> 01:12:55.771
THAT WE HAVE WITH VOTERS I THINK --

01:12:55.838 --> 01:12:57.573
THE BETTER -- PROBABLY ONE MORE

01:12:57.639 --> 01:12:59.908
SEARCH THAT WAS MADE WAS THE THE

01:12:59.975 --> 01:13:00.976
POINT THAT CURRENT STATE LAW

01:13:01.043 --> 01:13:02.878
USUALLY EXPRESSES VALUATIONS IN

01:13:02.945 --> 01:13:04.213
TERMS OF DOLLARS PER HUNDRED

01:13:04.279 --> 01:13:05.214
DOLLARS AND THAT S TRUE THERE

01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:06.248
ARE A COUPLE OF PLACES AND STATE

01:13:06.315 --> 01:13:07.316
LAW THAT THAT'S TRUE.

01:13:07.382 --> 01:13:09.885
BUT THAT I NOT A PUBLIC FACING

01:13:09.952 --> 01:13:11.320
PORTION OF THE STATE LAW WE'RE

01:13:11.386 --> 01:13:12.488
TALKING ABOUT THE REQUIRED

01:13:12.554 --> 01:13:13.756
BALLOT LANGUAGE AND SO IT'S

01:13:13.822 --> 01:13:16.225
REALLY APPLES AND ORANGES TO SAY.

01:13:16.291 --> 01:13:17.359
THAT -- WELL YOU KNOW WHAT WHAT

01:13:17.426 --> 01:13:19.027
THE CONVENTION IS IN STATE LAW

01:13:19.094 --> 01:13:20.662
AND WHAT WE PUT ON THE BALLOT

01:13:20.729 --> 01:13:21.130
WE'RE TRYING TO BE AS

01:13:21.196 --> 01:13:21.997
TRANSPARENT AS POSSIBLE SO I

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.165
HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTIONS

01:13:23.232 --> 01:13:25.267
BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS

01:13:25.334 --> 01:13:26.668
THAT ANYONE ELSE MIGHT HAVE.

01:13:26.735 --> 01:13:28.003
YOU SO MUCH TO SOMEONE WE'D LIKE

01:13:28.070 --> 01:13:32.908
TO GET OPEN UP FOR THE COMMITTEE

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:34.409
MISTER VICE CHAIR PLEASE

01:13:34.476 --> 01:13:34.710

SHARE -- I I ALWAYS THOUGHT IT

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:39.581
WAS IN THOUSANDS -- ALREADY FIVE

01:13:39.648 --> 01:13:42.351
KIND OF FASCINATED BY THE BILL

IS BECAUSE THE SCHOOL DISTRICT

HAD TO DO A BALLOT MEASURE THEY

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:09.378
COULDN'T SPEND THEIR OWN MONEY

01:14:09.444 --> 01:14:10.612
TO ADD TO IT ANALYZE HOW TO PUT

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.281
THIS TOGETHER?

01:14:12.347 --> 01:14:14.349
THE BOND TOGETHER SO USUALLY --

01:14:14.416 --> 01:14:16.819
WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN MY COUNTY --

01:14:16.885 --> 01:14:17.853
A BOND UNDERWRITER WOULD COME IN

01:14:17.920 --> 01:14:19.021
AND AND THEY WOULD PAY FOR THE

01:14:19.087 --> 01:14:19.655
POLLING AND THEY WOULD PAY FOR

01:14:19.721 --> 01:14:21.690
ALL THE PRELIMINARY WORK AND

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:23.091
THEY WOULD THE AT THE POLLING

01:14:23.158 --> 01:14:24.426
WOULD BE LIKE THIS -- DO YOU

01:14:24.493 --> 01:14:28.430
THINK YOU COULD PAY TEN DOLLARS

01:14:28.497 --> 01:14:29.164
PER.

01:14:29.231 --> 01:14:30.999
THOUSAND OR TWENTY DOLLARS PER

01:14:31.066 --> 01:14:31.934
THOUSAND OR THIRTY DOLLARS PER.

01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:32.601
THOUSAND AND THEN THEY COME BACK

01:14:32.668 --> 01:14:34.203
TO THE POLL RESULTS AND IT WOULD

01:14:34.269 --> 01:14:36.271
SAY YOU KNOW THE MAGIC NUMBERS

01:14:36.338 --> 01:14:38.173
EIGHTEEN DOLLARS PER THOUSAND SO

01:14:38.240 --> 01:14:38.740
THEN THEY LOOK AT THAT SAYS

01:14:38.807 --> 01:14:40.242
VALUE.

01:14:40.309 --> 01:14:41.476
IN THE IN THE IN THE DISTRICT

01:14:41.543 --> 01:14:43.512
IMAGE OKAY WE CAN DO A BOND

01:14:43.579 --> 01:14:45.547
BASED ON EIGHTEEN TIMES THE

01:14:45.614 --> 01:14:46.481
THOUSAND IN AND THEN THEY WOULD

01:14:46.548 --> 01:14:48.150
COME UP WITH THE BOND AMOUNT

01:14:48.217 --> 01:14:49.318
THAT THEY WOULD PUT ON THE

01:14:49.384 --> 01:14:50.219
BALLOT.

01:14:50.285 --> 01:14:51.220
BY THAT THAT POLLING DATA NOT BY

01:14:51.286 --> 01:14:53.288
WHAT THEY NEEDED TO DO TO REPAIR

01:14:53.355 --> 01:14:55.224
SCHOOLS ARE AT GYMS OR BUILD

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:57.392
TOOLS IT WAS BASED ON THIS

01:14:57.459 --> 01:14:58.260
POLLING.

01:14:58.327 --> 01:14:59.461
NUMBER.

01:14:59.528 --> 01:15:00.529
AND I JUST THOUGHT OH MY

01:15:00.596 --> 01:15:01.563
GOODNESS THE SIZING ISN'T EVEN.

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:06.435
BASED ON REAL HARD HARD DATA SO.

01:15:06.501 --> 01:15:08.036
THEN THEN THE BOND WOULD PASS

01:15:08.103 --> 01:15:09.104
AND THEN WHO GOT THE BUSINESS

01:15:09.171 --> 01:15:10.906

01:15:10.973 --> 01:15:12.341

01:15:16.445 --> 01:15:17.212
AND I I DON'T KNOW IF THAT'S

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:17.412
EVEN.

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.748
WHERE WE SHOULD BE BUT I I THINK

01:15:19.815 --> 01:15:22.317
THE IDEA OF STAYING UNIFORM WITH

01:15:22.384 --> 01:15:23.952
THOUSANDS MAKES MUCH MORE SENSE

01:15:24.019 --> 01:15:25.921
THAN HUNDREDS OR I THINK THE

01:15:25.988 --> 01:15:27.756
BILL SHOULD EVEN DO BOTH WE

01:15:27.823 --> 01:15:29.291

01:15:29.358 --> 01:15:31.093

01:33:15.856 --> 01:33:16.424
FACT WE'RE WORKING WITH THE

01:33:16.490 --> 01:33:18.426
INDUSTRY THE GOOD THING ABOUT

01:33:18.492 --> 01:33:20.027
THATIS THAT GIVING THEM THE

01:33:20.094 --> 01:33:21.696
THREE TO FOUR YEARS ALLOWS THE

01:33:21.762 --> 01:33:22.463
INDUSTRY AS WELL AS THE

01:33:22.530 --> 01:33:23.464
GOVERNMENT YOU KNOW THE THE

01:33:23.531 --> 01:33:25.266
STATE AND THE INDUSTRY TOGETHER

01:33:25.333 --> 01:33:26.834
TO GET THE WORD OUT. TO TO

01:33:26.901 --> 01:33:29.136
HOTELS AND MOTELS AND MAKE SURE

01:33:29.203 --> 01:33:30.504
THEY'RE IN COMPLIANCE AND THEY

01:33:30.571 --> 01:33:31.639
NEED ASSISTANCE.

01:33:31.706 --> 01:33:32.740
THE THE TO HAVE THEIR PRIMARY

01:33:32.807 --> 01:33:34.575
TRADE GROUP IN SUPPORT I THINK

01:33:34.642 --> 01:33:36.277
IS A REALLY GOOD POSITION TO BE

01:33:36.344 --> 01:33:38.646
AND AND AND MANY PHOTOS ALREADY

01:33:38.713 --> 01:33:39.981
MOVING THAT DIRECTION BUT THEN

01:33:40.047 --> 01:33:40.948
THIS YEAR MARRIOTT.

01:33:41.015 --> 01:33:42.016
BUT TO BE UNDER PROPERTIES NORTH

01:33:42.083 --> 01:33:43.184
AMERICA ALREADY PAYS OUT OF

01:33:43.250 --> 01:33:45.119
SINGLE USE PLASTIC AND SO IT'S

01:33:45.186 --> 01:33:46.354
ALREADY THE DRUG TO THE INDUSTRY

01:33:46.420 --> 01:33:48.055
PARTLY BECAUSE IT DOES SAVE THE

01:33:48.122 --> 01:33:48.289
MONEY.

01:33:48.356 --> 01:33:49.924
AND THE THREE TO FOUR YEAR LEAD

01:33:49.991 --> 01:33:50.524
TIME TO GET THEM.

01:33:50.591 --> 01:33:52.126
EVEN THE SMALLER OPERATORS TIME

01:33:52.193 --> 01:33:53.494
OF THE FOUR YEARS WE GIVE

01:33:53.561 --> 01:34:01.836
SMALLER OPERATORS THE TIME -- IN

01:34:01.902 --> 01:34:04.472
A BASIN AND SO I THINK FOR TODAY

01:34:04.538 --> 01:34:05.473
AND I'M GOING TO JUST LAY OFF

01:34:05.539 --> 01:34:06.474
THE BILL JUST BECAUSE I WANT TO

01:34:06.540 --> 01:34:07.341
BE ABLE TO DIG A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:34:07.408 --> 01:34:08.943
INTO IT -- BUT YOU KNOW THAT

01:34:09.010 --> 01:34:09.510
DOESN'T MEAN THAT I A WILL

01:34:09.577 --> 01:34:12.013
OPPOSE OR SUPPORTED ON THE FLOOR

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:12.646
IF IF AND WHEN IT DOES GET THERE

01:34:12.713 --> 01:34:13.247
BUT I JUST WANTEDTO PUT THAT

01:34:13.314 --> 01:34:15.883
THERE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT I

01:34:15.950 --> 01:34:17.051
DO SOME MORE RESEARCH.

01:34:17.118 --> 01:34:18.719
YOU KNOW LOOK INTO IT A BIT MORE

01:34:18.786 --> 01:34:20.554
ON MY OWN AND THE IMPACTS ON ON

01:34:20.621 --> 01:34:21.922
THE DISTRICT.

01:34:21.989 --> 01:34:22.690
THE IN IT BUT I DON'T KNOW IF

01:34:22.757 --> 01:34:23.691
THE IF YOU LIKE TO HEAR THE

01:34:23.758 --> 01:34:25.192
SUPERVISOR TALK ABOUT THE LOCAL

01:34:25.259 --> 01:34:28.129
IMPACT ANYMORE OR IF.

01:34:28.195 --> 01:34:28.896
THAT BE HELPFUL AT ALL TO YOU

01:34:28.963 --> 01:34:30.331
THOSE ARE ALL THE QUESTIONS I

01:34:30.398 --> 01:34:32.299
HAVE FOR TODAY.

01:34:32.366 --> 01:34:34.902
THANK YOU BECAUSE IT CENTER.

01:34:34.969 --> 01:34:36.737
WHAT WHAT OF SAVING ON TWO ITEMS --

01:34:36.804 --> 01:34:37.304
IN THEIR TURN OVER THE VICE

01:34:37.371 --> 01:34:37.938
CHAIR I THINK ON THE ISSUE OF

01:34:38.005 --> 01:34:39.206
CHARTER CITIES.

01:34:39.273 --> 01:34:39.807
YES THERE'S A BELIEF I THINK

01:34:39.874 --> 01:34:42.676
THAT IS A MEMBER WANTS TO BE AND

01:34:42.743 --> 01:34:43.978
I DON'T EVER PUT WORDS IN THE

01:34:44.045 --> 01:34:44.845
SOME MEMBERS MATH THAT BEING

01:34:44.912 --> 01:34:46.547
EXPLICIT ON THAT ISSUE BECAUSE I

01:34:46.614 --> 01:34:47.181
THINK THAT'S GONNA BE POURED I

01:34:47.248 --> 01:34:48.182
THAT MAYBE.

01:34:48.249 --> 01:34:48.916
SOME FURTHER CONVERSATION DOWN

01:34:48.983 --> 01:34:50.351
THE ROAD AND I DO BELIEVE THAT

01:34:50.418 --> 01:34:51.852
INDUSTRY WOULD SUPPORT THAT AS

01:34:51.919 --> 01:34:52.286
WELL.

01:34:52.353 --> 01:34:54.255
THAT'S CORRECT -- SO WE ARE

01:34:54.321 --> 01:34:55.456
LOOKING AT YEAH A DECEPTIVE THE

01:34:55.523 --> 01:34:56.757
CLARIFICATION MAKING SURE THAT'S

01:34:56.824 --> 01:34:57.658
EXPLICIT.

01:34:57.725 --> 01:34:59.427
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S IT'S

01:34:59.493 --> 01:35:01.595
IMPORTANT AND AGAIN JUST WANTED

01:35:01.662 --> 01:35:02.963
TO COME A MOMENT TO SAY THANK

01:35:03.030 --> 01:35:04.432
YOU TO THIS IN THE REFER TACK ON

01:35:04.498 --> 01:35:07.668
THIS ISSUE -- IN INCREASES IN

01:35:07.735 --> 01:35:08.536
NUMBER BUT PUSH BACK ON THE IF

01:35:08.602 --> 01:35:09.437
YOU THINK I'M INCORRECT I THINK

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:10.638
ON THE ISSUE OF WHY YOU'RE

01:35:10.704 --> 01:35:11.906
LOOKING AT STATEWIDE IS TO BE

01:35:11.972 --> 01:35:12.506
ABLE.

01:35:12.573 --> 01:35:14.308
TO TRY TO BETTER YOU BRING IN A

01:35:14.375 --> 01:35:15.976
FORMAL -- Là CRY SO THAT

01:35:16.043 --> 01:35:18.913
EVERYONE BIG OR SMALL -- IS

01:35:18.979 --> 01:35:20.815
SUBJECT TO THAT -- BUT THEY'RE

01:35:20.881 --> 01:35:23.350
MOST LIKELY WON'T BE A WHOLE LOT

01:35:23.417 --> 01:35:25.453
OF LOCAL ENFORCEMENT BUT TRYING

01:35:25.519 --> 01:35:27.154
TO GET A STREAMLINED THAT AND I

01:35:27.221 --> 01:35:27.388
WOULD.

01:35:27.455 --> 01:35:29.924
CHARACTERIZE THE COST OF MINOR

01:35:29.990 --> 01:35:33.661
YEAH -- IF NOT OBSERVABLE ACROSS

01:35:33.727 --> 01:35:42.670
THE STATE.

01:35:42.736 --> 01:35:44.004
THAT'S CORRECT POSTURE AND THE

01:35:44.071 --> 01:35:45.106
THE UNIFORMITY IS CRITICAL

01:35:45.172 --> 01:35:47.174
ESPECIALLY FOR THE INDUSTRY --

01:35:47.241 --> 01:35:49.777
IMAGINE IF YOU HAVE ONE JUST SIX

01:35:49.844 --> 01:35:50.411
AND THAT'S GOING TO BAN LOTION

01:35:50.478 --> 01:35:52.113
ANOTHER ONE TO PAY IS ANOTHER

01:35:52.179 --> 01:35:52.680
ONE IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE A

01:35:52.746 --> 01:35:53.347
DIFFERENT KIND OF DISPENSER THAN

01:35:53.414 --> 01:35:54.849
THE ONE ACROSS THE STREET.

01:35:54.915 --> 01:35:56.317
THE CITY ACROSS THE STREET.

01:35:56.383 --> 01:35:57.318
AND THAT'S I THINK WHY WAS WILL

01:35:57.384 --> 01:35:57.918
BE ABLE TO WORK SO WELL WITH

01:35:57.985 --> 01:35:59.153
INDUSTRY IS AT THE RECOGNITION

01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:00.387
THAT.

01:36:00.454 --> 01:36:01.622
THAT -- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE THE

01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:02.656
COUNTY OF SANTA CRUZ TAKE

01:36:02.723 --> 01:36:03.190
LEADERSHIP.

01:36:03.257 --> 01:36:04.658
OTHER CITIES COUNTIES MAY VERY

01:36:04.725 --> 01:36:06.360
WELL FOLLOW I THINK HAVING A

01:36:06.427 --> 01:36:07.828
UNIFORM WILL NOT ONLY GET THIS

01:36:07.895 --> 01:36:08.829
IN PLACE MORE QUICKLY -- BUT

01:36:08.896 --> 01:36:10.131
ACROSS THE BOARD BUT IT PREVENTS

01:36:10.197 --> 01:36:11.599
THESE ONE OFFS WHICH WOULD MAKE

01:36:11.665 --> 01:36:12.266
IT REALLY CHALLENGING FOR THE

01:36:12.333 --> 01:36:12.833
INDUSTRY AND FRANKLY FOR THE

01:36:12.900 --> 01:36:14.068
STATE. TO BE ABLE TO REGULATE

01:36:14.135 --> 01:36:15.069
AND MONITOR IN A WAY THAT MAKES

01:36:15.136 --> 01:36:16.570
SENSE FOR REDUCING THE PLASTIC

01:36:16.637 --> 01:36:18.105
AS WELL AS BEING TOO ONEROUS FOR

01:36:18.172 --> 01:36:19.140
THE INDUSTRY.

01:36:19.206 --> 01:36:23.844
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR IN TURN

01:36:23.911 --> 01:36:24.411
OVER THE VICE CHAIR MS VICE

01:36:24.478 --> 01:36:27.281
CHAIR.

01:36:27.348 --> 01:36:27.481
YOU.

01:36:27.548 --> 01:36:29.283
FAIR SOMETIMES -- WE GET TO

01:36:29.350 --> 01:36:30.050
WATCH INDUSTRY AND THEY'RE THE

01:36:30.117 --> 01:36:31.018
KIND OF SELF REGULATE AND START

01:36:31.085 --> 01:36:32.219
TAKING CARE OF THE CONCERNS OVER

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:33.521
HEARING TESTIMONY THAT THE MAJOR

01:36:33.587 --> 01:36:34.188
CHAINS ARE.

01:36:34.255 --> 01:36:35.856
ALREADY MOVING IN A CERTAIN

01:36:35.923 --> 01:36:36.757
DIRECTION SO I'VE.

01:36:36.824 --> 01:36:38.692
KIND OF WANT.

01:36:38.759 --> 01:36:39.326
TO MAYBE HAS SOME.

01:36:39.393 --> 01:36:40.227
SIMPLE QUESTIONS JUST SO THAT I

01:36:40.294 --> 01:36:41.829
CAN ANSWER THEM WHEN I GET OUT

01:36:41.896 --> 01:36:44.999
IN PUBLIC HERE -- THE FIRST IS

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:46.467
IF IF THEY'RE VOLUNTARILY.

01:36:46.534 --> 01:36:49.703
MAKING GREAT MOVES OUT WHY THE

01:36:49.770 --> 01:36:52.072
NEED FOR THE BILL.

01:36:52.139 --> 01:36:53.240
I THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT

01:36:53.307 --> 01:36:54.408
QUESTION I THINK PART OF IT IS

01:36:54.475 --> 01:36:56.310
THAT YES THE INDUSTRY IS MOVING

01:36:56.377 --> 01:36:58.245
IN THAT DIRECTION INDUSTRY HAS

01:36:58.312 --> 01:36:59.380
TENDED TO BE A FOR THINKING WHEN

01:36:59.446 --> 01:37:02.283
IT COMES IN BY MAIL ISSUES.

01:37:02.349 --> 01:37:05.019
HOWEVER A THE FACT THAT YOU HAVE

01:37:05.085 --> 01:37:07.354
A UNIFORM RULE THAT PUTS A TIME

01:37:07.421 --> 01:37:08.022
LINE IN PLACE THAT'S ACCOUNTABLE

01:37:08.088 --> 01:37:09.490
TIMELINE FOR THE INDUSTRY IN

01:37:09.557 --> 01:37:12.293
ORDER TO GET BOTH THE LARGEST

01:37:12.359 --> 01:37:13.694
MOTELS.

01:37:13.761 --> 01:37:16.964
ON BOARD -- IT IN FRANKLY IT'S

01:37:17.031 --> 01:37:17.865
AS IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT IF THE

01:37:17.932 --> 01:37:18.933
INDUSTRY WASN'T GOING IN THAT

01:37:18.999 --> 01:37:20.301
DIRECTION FOLKS SAY WELL WHY YOU

01:37:20.367 --> 01:37:21.001
PUSHING INDUSTRY THAT'S NOT

01:37:21.068 --> 01:37:21.835
READY YET.

01:37:21.902 --> 01:37:22.703
WHAT INDUSTRY SHOWS AND IS READY

01:37:22.770 --> 01:37:24.038
I THINK THIS IS ACTUALLY THE

01:37:24.104 --> 01:37:25.573
OPPORTUNE TIME FOR US TO PUT IN

01:37:25.639 --> 01:37:29.843
A STATE RULE THAT'S UNIFORM --

01:37:29.910 --> 01:37:32.213
AND AGAIN I THINK THAT IT WOULD

01:37:32.279 --> 01:37:35.249
BE.

01:37:35.316 --> 01:37:37.284
A REALLY -- BACK.

01:37:37.351 --> 01:37:38.052
TO THE VERY CHALLENGING FOR THE

01:37:38.118 --> 01:37:39.320
INDUSTRY IF YOU START GETTING TO

01:37:39.386 --> 01:37:40.321
AT TEN TWENTY THIRTY ORDINANCES

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:40.955
AND SO I THINK THAT'S WHAT THE

01:37:41.021 --> 01:37:42.656
TIMING IS ACTUALLY PERFECT IN

01:37:42.723 --> 01:37:42.957
THAT SENSE.

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:44.258
BECAUSE SINCE THE INDUSTRY'S

01:37:44.325 --> 01:37:45.426
ALREADY MOVING IN THAT DIRECTION

01:37:45.492 --> 01:37:46.760
IF WE DO NOTHING.

01:37:46.827 --> 01:37:48.429
THE NEXT FIVE YEARS I CAN ALMST

01:37:48.495 --> 01:37:49.230
GUARANTEE THEY'LL BE AT LEAST A

01:37:49.296 --> 01:37:51.265
DOZEN DIFFERENT LOCAL ORDINANCES

01:37:51.332 --> 01:37:52.433
IN PLACE THEN THE INDUSTRY TO

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:54.368
COME TO US TO SAY CAN YOU JUST

01:37:54.435 --> 01:37:55.369
MAKE A UNIFORM RULE.

01:37:55.436 --> 01:37:56.170
AND THE WILL HAVE LOCAL

01:37:56.237 --> 01:37:57.271
JURISDICTIONS SAYING WAIT A

01:37:57.338 --> 01:37:57.805
SECOND YOU TAKE MY LOCAL

01:37:57.871 --> 01:37:58.772
PREEMPTION RATCHET GETTING AHEAD

01:37:58.839 --> 01:38:00.841
OF THAT BY MAKING A UNIFORM RULE

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:02.176
ACROSS THE STATE RIGHT NOW.

01:38:02.243 --> 01:38:03.477
SO THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS

01:38:03.544 --> 01:38:04.678
DON'T EVEN HAVE TO LOOK AT THE

01:38:04.745 --> 01:38:06.213
ISSUE THEY ALREADY KNOW THEY'RE

01:38:06.280 --> 01:38:07.081
DOING THAT THAT THE STATE IS

01:38:07.147 --> 01:38:07.948
ALREADY WORKING ON PHASING OUT

01:38:08.015 --> 01:38:09.750
THIS PLASTIC.

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:10.317
AND I THINK IT PUTS US IN A

01:38:10.384 --> 01:38:11.552
POSITION WHERE.

01:38:11.619 --> 01:38:12.886
INDUSTRY WE'RE DOING WHAT'S

01:38:12.953 --> 01:38:14.555
RIGHT RIGHT FOR THE ENVIRONMENT

01:38:14.622 --> 01:38:15.522
WHAT'S RIGHT FOR THE INDUSTRY IN

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:17.224
TERMS OF REDUCING THEIR COSTS

01:38:17.291 --> 01:38:21.695
BUT ALSO.

01:38:21.762 --> 01:38:24.365
PREVENTS -- THE THIRTY DIFFERENT

01:38:24.431 --> 01:38:26.033
RULES FOR INDUSTRY DATA BYE BYE --

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:28.002
WHEN -- HOTEL GUESTS ARRIVED

01:38:28.068 --> 01:38:29.436
THERE USED TO ALWAYS LITTLE BOND

01:38:29.503 --> 01:38:29.637
YEAH.

01:38:29.703 --> 01:38:30.604
OTHER GOING TO GET.

01:38:30.671 --> 01:38:32.339
DISPENSERS TYPICALLY WILL BE

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:33.707
DISPENSERS AND OTHER ACTION I'VE

01:38:33.774 --> 01:38:34.842
BEEN TO A NUMBER OF HOTELS ARE

01:38:34.908 --> 01:38:36.744
TRAVEL WERE YOU SEE DISPENSERS

01:38:36.810 --> 01:38:38.979
THAT ARE IN PLACE THERE SECURE

01:38:39.046 --> 01:38:41.282
THEIR SAFE -- THEIR BILLABLE IN

01:38:41.348 --> 01:38:43.684
A SAFE MANNER AND BY THE WAY --

01:38:43.751 --> 01:38:45.052
THE LITTLE BOTTLES ARE STILL

01:38:45.119 --> 01:38:47.321
AVAILABLE AT THE FRONT DESK --

01:38:47.388 --> 01:38:48.489
IN SO IF THE HOTEL WNTS TO MAKE

01:38:48.555 --> 01:38:50.357

01:54:39.405 --> 01:54:40.573
ALSO STRIKE THAT BALANCE

01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:42.442

TO A. B. FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX

02:04:43.709 --> 02:04:44.677
THAT ACTUALLY DO RESOLVE SOME OF

02:04:44.743 --> 02:04:46.312
OUR CONCERNS WITH THE BILL.

02:04:46.378 --> 02:04:48.180
I'D ALSO LIKE TO NOTE THAT THE

02:04:48.247 --> 02:04:50.182
AMENDMENTS TAKEN THE FIRST HOUSE

02:04:50.249 --> 02:04:51.550
TO REMOVE LEASES FROM THE BILL

02:04:51.617 --> 02:04:52.985
WERE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND

02:04:53.052 --> 02:04:55.821
RESOLVE THE CONCERNS FOR MANY

02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:56.388
SPECIAL DISTRICTS ACROSS THE

02:04:56.455 --> 02:04:57.056

02:04:57.122 --> 02:04:58.490
HOWEVER WE ARE WE DO REMAIN

02:04:58.557 --> 02:05:00.159
RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE THE BILL

02:05:00.226 --> 02:05:01.994
UNTIL IT HAS BEEN AMENDED TO

02:05:02.061 --> 02:05:03.729
EXAMPLE AND THAT SPECIAL

02:05:03.796 --> 02:05:05.197
DISTRICTS NEED TO FILTER PUBLIC

02:05:05.264 --> 02:05:06.398
PURPOSES.

02:05:06.465 --> 02:05:08.734
THE BILL EVEN AS PROPOSED TO BE

02:05:08.801 --> 02:05:10.502
AMENDED WOULD ONLY EXAMPLE AND

02:05:10.569 --> 02:05:11.937
HAS BEEN USED BY THE AGENCY FOR

02:05:12.004 --> 02:05:13.539
ITS OPERATIONS.

02:05:13.606 --> 02:05:14.707
SPECIAL DISTRICTS FREQUENTLY

02:05:14.773 --> 02:05:16.642
SELL LAND TO THIRD PARTIES IN

02:05:16.709 --> 02:05:17.176
ORDER TO PROVIDE A PUBLIC

02:05:17.243 --> 02:05:18.344
BENEFIT.

02:05:18.410 --> 02:05:20.079
OR SERVICE TO THE COMMUNITY.

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:21.580
AS WRITTEN THE BILL WOULD MAKE

02:05:21.647 --> 02:05:24.216
THESE LAND LAND TRANSFER SUBJECT

02:05:24.283 --> 02:05:25.517
TO THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT.

02:05:25.584 --> 02:05:26.518
AND IN A MOMENT MY COLLEAGUE

02:05:26.585 --> 02:05:27.653
WITH THE HEALTH CARE DISTRICTS

02:05:27.720 --> 02:05:29.488
WILL PROVIDE SOME EXAMPLES OF

02:05:29.555 --> 02:05:31.957
CRITICALLY NEEDED EXEMPTIONS.

02:05:32.024 --> 02:05:33.092
ARTS SECOND CONCERT REMAINING

02:05:33.158 --> 02:05:36.262
CONCERN WITH THE BILL IS THAT AB

02:05:36.328 --> 02:05:36.896
FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX WOULD MAKE

02:05:36.962 --> 02:05:38.530
IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR AGENCIES

02:05:38.597 --> 02:05:39.832
TO NEGOTIATE.

02:05:39.899 --> 02:05:41.200
AND GET THE FAIR MARKET VALUE

02:05:41.267 --> 02:05:42.368
FOR THEIR LAND.

02:05:42.434 --> 02:05:43.469
THE BILL WOULD ALSO REQUIRE

02:05:43.535 --> 02:05:45.537
AGENCIES TO SEND OUT NOTICES

02:05:45.604 --> 02:05:48.073
NOTICES AVAILABILITY PRIOR TO

02:05:48.140 --> 02:05:49.475
PARTICIPATING NEGOTIATIONS.

02:05:49.541 --> 02:05:51.043
THE BILL UNFORTUNATELY DOES NOT

02:05:51.110 --> 02:05:54.213
PROVIDE A HELPFUL DEFINITION OF

02:05:54.280 --> 02:05:55.581
NEGOTIATIONS AND IS THIS LACK OF

02:05:55.648 --> 02:05:57.082
A BRIGHT LINE THAT WILL CONFUSE

02:05:57.149 --> 02:05:58.684
AGENCIES ATTEMPTING TO COMPLY

02:05:58.751 --> 02:06:00.686
WITH THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT.

02:06:00.753 --> 02:06:01.620
I DON'T FLAT THIS IS

02:06:01.687 --> 02:06:04.490

FOURTEEN EIGHTY SIX PENALIZES

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:06.992

THE SURPLUS LANDS ACT.

02:06:08.994 --> 02:06:10.195
AS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED

02:06:10.262 --> 02:06:12.197
AGENCIES IN VIOLATION WOULD PAY

02:06:12.264 --> 02:06:14.333
A FINE OF UP 250% OF THE LAND'S

02:06:14.400 --> 02:06:15.467
VALUE.

02:06:15.534 --> 02:06:17.236
THIS IS INCREDIBLY PUNITIVE AND

02:06:17.303 --> 02:06:19.204
EXPOSE A SMALL SPECIAL DISTRICTS

02:06:19.271 --> 02:06:20.706
THE RISK OF INSOLVENCY IF

02:06:20.773 --> 02:06:22.274
THEY'RE UNABLE TO PAY THE FINE.

02:06:22.341 --> 02:06:24.410
MORE LIKELY THESE PROVISIONS

02:06:24.476 --> 02:06:26.211
WILL SIMPLY DETERMINE YOU

02:06:26.278 --> 02:06:27.179
SPECIAL DISTRICTS FROM DISPOSING

02:06:27.246 --> 02:06:28.914
OF THE LAND AT ALL RATHER THAN

02:06:28.981 --> 02:06:30.549
RISKING THE PENALTIES IMPOSED BY

02:06:30.616 --> 02:06:31.250
THE BILL.

02:06:31.317 --> 02:06:32.184
THE SELECTION LEAD TO LESS

02:06:32.251 --> 02:06:33.752
PUBLIC LAND BEING DEVELOPED FOR

02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:35.354
AFFORDABLE HOUSING ACROSS THE

OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED

UNFORTUNATELY THE AMENDMENTS
