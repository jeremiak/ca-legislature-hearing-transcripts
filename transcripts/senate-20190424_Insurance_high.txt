RIGHT. THE SENATE COMMITTEE WILL START. WILL COME TO ORDER I'LL BUT THE LACK OF A QUORUM WE'RE GONNA START AS A SUB COMMITTEE. MR HERTZBERG YOU MAY COME UP PLEASE. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I AM HERE TODAY WITH THE A STEAM. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- I AM SO PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS. AS THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY OF WHICH HE IS A LEADING MEMBER HAS. MONSTER THIS LEGISLATION TODAY NOW. HERE'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DO. IN THIS DEAL AND I THINK THAT THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITIES LEADERSHIP IN THIS IS NOTHING LESS THAN EXTRAORDINARY BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE DOING THIS AND I GIVE. TO HEAR FROM INSURANCE COMMISSIONER MINUTE. HIS LEADERSHIP IN THIS REGARD BUT HERE'S THE SITUATION. WE HAD A HORRIBLE EARTHQUAKE TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. JUST LIKE IN THE IT THEIR NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE GOVERNMENT RESPONDED BY CREATING THIS KIND OF CRAZY I GOVERNMENTAL ENTITY DETAILS OF WHICH ARE IMPORTANT CALL THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. BASICALLY GOVERNMENT SAID LOOK EVERYBODY WHO HAS A HOMEOWNER'S POLICY IS REQUIRED. TO OFFER THIS INSURANCE. 80% OF THE COMPANIES DECIDED TO PARTICIPATE CONTRIBUTING UP TO SEVEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS INTO A FUND. ALL OF THIS CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY WHICH HAD A LIMITED KIND OF A POLICY AND 20% OF THE COMPANY'S CHOSE NOT TO THEY CHOSE TO WRITE THEIR OWN POLICIES OUTSIDE OF THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. OKAY. AND SO WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS BEEN IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS THANK GOD WE REALLY HAVEN'T HAD THE GIGANTIC EARTHQUAKES. I ONLY EQUATE THIS TO THE FIRES BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS ONE IN HUNDREDS OF YOUR EQUITY -- FIRE AND THEN WE HAVE ANOTHER ONE AND WE'RE SCARED WILL HAVE ANOTHER ONE AND HENCE THIS BY THIS GOVERNMENT IS NOW DEBATING WHAT WE DO WHEN WE HAVE THESE CATASTROPHES. WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO AND THIS CAME FROM THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITIES LEADERSHIP AND AND I LOVE THE IDEA IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED I WANT EXPLAINS SOME OF THE ELEMENTS? BUT BUT THE IDEA OF FIGURING OUT HOW WE CAN BE PREVENTATIVE. HOW WE CAN COME UP WITH THE WAY THAT IF THERE IS GOING TO BE EARTHQUAKE WE CAN REDUCE THE RISK AND THE DAMAGE IT'S BEING COST? OKAY WE KNOW FROM THE EVIDENCE THAT WERE TOLD BY THE EXPERTS WE DON'T KNOW WHAT'S REAL BECAUSE TO PREDICT THE FUTURE BUT THERE'S A 99% POINT NINETY EIGHT POINT 3% CHANCE. THAT A SIX POINT SEVEN EARTHQUAKE THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS. THANK THAT'S A BIG DEAL THAT'S A BIG DEAL. AND SO WHAT DO WE DO THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY ON ITS OWN HAS STARTED WAS CALLED THE BRACE AND BOLD PROGRAM FOR OF SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES WE PROPOSED ALSO INCLUDE APARTMENT BUILDINGS. IS ONE POINT TWO MILLION SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES IN CALIFORNIA THAT CAN REALLY HAVE A SIGNIFICANT RISK OF HAVING VERY VERY SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE YOU LOOK AT THIS. POSTER BEHIND YOU'LL SEE YOU'LL YOU'LL SEE A HOUSE THAT WAS RETROFITTED VERSUS NOT BEING RETROFITTED AND THE DAMAGE THAT WAS CAUSED AS A RESULT IN JUST A FEW THOUSAND DOLLAR BRACE IN BOTH PROGRAMS. THERE'S ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND HOMES WITH WHAT THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY DID WAS THEY OFFERED UP TO EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA. TO APPLY FOR A GRANT OF THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BRACE AND BOLD THEIR HOME. THEY GOT ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND TAKERS THE LIST IS LONG I TRIED TO SIGN UP FOR ONE BECAUSE MY HOUSE WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT AND THE THE IT WAS CLOSE. AND I COULDN'T GET ONE DONE. SO NOW WHAT IS THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY DONE IN MODERNIZING WHERE THEY WANT TO GO. WHAT'S HAPPENED TO ME TO SHOW THIS TO YOU BEAR WITH ME. JUST FOR THE RECORD I WILL STATE THAT WITHOUT OBJECTION THE COMMITTEE WILL ALLOW THE USE OF PROPS THANK YOU. MR HERTZBERG IF YOU DON'T MIND HOLDING OUT FOR GONNA CALL THE ROLL TO ENSURE WE HAVE A QUORUM THANK YOU [inaudible] IBM -- WITH THEIR PRESENT JONES ARCHULETA. YOUR LETTER PRESENT BATES. PRESENT FOR JUST. WHAT IS PRESENT DODD PRESENT GALGIANI. GALGIANI PRESENT GLAZER HUESO [inaudible] MITCHELL [inaudible] MORE LOCK [inaudible] TWENTY NO ROTH [inaudible] PRESENT. OKAY -- SO WHAT HAPPENS WITH THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS IS THAT BECAUSE THEY HAVEN'T. SPENT A LOT OF MONEY ON EARTHQUAKE REPAIRS THEY'VE CONTINUE TO ACCUMULATE DOLLARS INTO A FUND THE EARTHQUAKE BOND. AND WHAT'S HAPPENED HAS BEEN IN A NUT SHELL THE THAT ALONE SHOULD. IS THAT. THE READING. IN ORDER TO PROPERLY RATE THIS FUND THIS TRIPLE A HAS SAID WE NEED SIX SEVENTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN COVERAGE WHICH IS A ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED YEAR EVENT. TO MAKE SURE WILL GIVE YOU THIS RATING. SO HOW DOES THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY DO IT AND WHAT ARE WE DOING TO CHANGE THAT. THEY HAVE FIVE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS IN CAPITAL. THEY ALSO HAVE TO GO OUT AND BUY EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN REINSURANCE. AND THEY HAVE CERTAIN SURCHARGES AND OTHER THINGS THE TOP OF THIS TO GET TO THEIR SEVENTEEN POINT. SIX MY FOCUS IS ON THE COST OF THIS EIGHT POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLARS. THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY HAS SPENT. EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS CORRECT. FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN PREMIUMS IN THE LAST TWENTY FIVE YEARS. AND THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT GOT THAT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS PAID OUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS. OKAY SO WE'VE GOT THIS FICTION THIS LEGAL FICTION IT'S COSTING WHAT THREE FIFTY MILLION A YEAR. THE MILLION DOLLARS IN INSURANCE PREMIUMS THE QUESTION IS HOW CAN WE COME UP WITH. A CREATIVE WAY. THAT WILL ALLOW US TO SPEND A HUNDRED MILLION UP TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR ON THE BRACE IN BOTH PROGRAMS UNDERSTAND. THE BRAZEN BULL PROGRAM APPLIES TO WHETHER YOU'RE COVERED BY THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY OR NOT COVERED MOST OF THE FOLKS THAT CURRENTLY HAVE AVAIL THEMSELVES OF BRAZEN BULL PROGRAM. HAVE DONE IN THE AREAS THAT ARE PART OF BOMBS THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE. TO POLICY HOLDERS BY THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY WITH 80% OF THE MARKET. OKAY SO ARE PROPOSAL HERE IN THE SIMPLEST TERMS IS THE FOLLOWING. BUT WE'RE SEEKING TO DO IS. BASICALLY WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING EDUCATION CLASS WITHOUT ADVERSELY AFFECTING CHILD CARE. FOSTER CARE ANYTHING ELSE THAT WE CHOOSE TO DO WITH GENERAL FUND DOLLARS HOW CAN WE CREATE THE SITUATION WHERE THE INVESTORS ARE WHERE THE THE RATING AGENCIES WILL STILL GIVE US THE RATINGS THAT WE NEED. SEC WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO WITH OF WILDFIRES. ON THE ONE HAND WITH AND SAVING MONEY AND WE CAN SAVE ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR. ALL OF WHICH WILL GO TO A BRACE IN BOTH PROGRAM. THE BOTTOM LINE MESSAGES THIS IS ALL ABOUT PUBLIC SAFETY AND GETTING AHEAD OF THE ISSUE. PEOPLE WERE SAYING OH MY GOD WE'RE GONNA COST US A BUNCH OF MONEY. WELL WHAT HAS TO HAPPEN IS IF YOU SEE THIS. RIGHT DOWN HERE TO GIVE YOU SOME SENSE AT ALL ALMOST FOR THE SHOW TERM INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. THIS IS THE LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE SO IF WE HAD ANOTHER LOMA PRIETA EARTHQUAKE IN CURRENT DOLLARS. ALL THE CAPITAL IN THE ACCOUNT WOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. IF WE HAD A NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE IN CURRENT DOLLARS. B. INSURANCE AND CAPITAL WOULD COVERAGE. IF WE HAD A SAN FRANCISCO EARTHQUAKE. IN CURRENT DOLLARS IT WOULD COVER HERE. AND THEN A ONE IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR EARTHQUAKE WHICH WOULD BE FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CURRENT DOLLARS IS ONLY AT THE POINT AT WHICH THIS CONTINGENT LIABILITY. KICKS IN. THAT'S IT. THE QUESTION FOR ALL OF US AS WE TEND AS PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS TO TRYING TO BE HONORABLE TO THE FOLKS THAT WE REPRESENT WHEN WE KNOW ALL THAT WE HAVE TO MODERNIZE HE SYSTEM WHEN YES THERE WERE DIFFERENT STANDARDS OF THE TIME THIS WAS GREAT TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. WHEN YOU HEAR THOSE OLD ARGUMENTS BUT THE WORLD HAS CHANGED AND INTEREST WHICH IS GOING TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THAT? CAN WE REDUCE BY A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE SPENDING. ON REINSURANCE AND PUT THAT. INTO BRACING BOLD -- PLACES PRIORITIZE WHERE THERE'S A HIGH PROPENSITY FOR EARTHQUAKE SMART POLICY. THE COST OF THAT. IS THIS VERY MINUSCULE. CONTINGENT LIABILITY ON INSURANCE POLICIES. UP HERE AT THE TOP AND YOU HAVE TO GET TO A ONE IN TWO HUNDRED FIFTY YEAR EVENT BEFORE THAT KICKS IN. ALL THESE OTHERS CREEKS ALREADY PAID FOR BY THIS EARLIER DEAL. IS IT IS IT THE BOTTOM LINE IS. IS THE PERFECT [inaudible] NO. IF ANYTHING WE DO IN GOVERNMENT PERFECT BUT WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO FACE AN EARTHQUAKE. AND WE HAVE TO BE SMART ABOUT IT. I WAS VERY IMPRESSED WHEN THEY CAN WE SPENT SIX MONTHS GOING THROUGH THE STUFF DURING THE BREAK AND I'M GIVING HIM A HARD TIME KICKING THE TIRES. THERE'S AN ISSUE AS TO WHETHER THESE ATTACKS. I KNOW THAT THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS WRITTEN AND NOW BEING WRITTEN FOR MY UNDERSTAND WE'VE BEEN CONCEPTS ALSO STATION WITH THE ALLEGE COUNSEL'S OFFICE TO TRY TO GET THEM TO RE WRITE THEIR THINKING. MY ARGUMENT IS A TAXES YOU YOU GET YOUR YOUR OBLIGATION TO PAY SOMETHING AND IT GOES TO PAY FOR CERTAIN GOVERNMENT SERVICES THIS IS A CONTINGENT OBLIGATION. THAT OCCURS AFTER EXTRAORDINARY CIRCUMSTANCES AND THE QUESTION IS FROM A PUBLIC POLICY PERSPECTIVE IS IT THE RIGHT THING TO DO. WANTS TO ENGAGE IN A DISCUSSION OF WHETHER TO TAX I KNOW THAT WORDS A BAD WORD. I ALSO DO NOT WANT TO PUT ON ANY MEMBER OF EITHER PARTY IN THIS HOUSE. THE OBLIGATION TO VOTE FOR TAX BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE THE ANALYSIS THAT WAS DONE THIS IS OF CASE OF FIRST IMPRESSION. MY IDEA IS POTENTIALLY IT THIS GETS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY TO PUT A PROVISION IN. THAT BASICALLY SAYS THIS WILL GO INTO EFFECT UNTIL THERE'S A JUDICIAL DETERMINATION THAT THIS IS NOT A TAX BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO PUT ANYBODY IN A POSITION THAT THIS IS A TAX. BUT THE IDEA IS AND WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING OH MY GOD OF THESE POLICIES ARE GONNA BE UPSIDE DOWN YEAH WHAT'S THE WORLD IN LOOK LIKE. AFTER A LARGER THAN IF YOU ADD UP LOMA PRIETA AND SAN FRANCISCO WE GOT SOMETHING BIGGER THAN THAT. WHAT'S THE IMPACT TO EVERYBODY IN CALIFORNIA DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY NOT JUST THE HOMES THAT ARE THAT THAT ARE THAT ARE UPSIDE DOWN BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN DESTROYED. AND WE CAN HELP PREVENT THAT WHAT WHAT ABOUT WHAT ABOUT THE CONSEQUENCES TO COMMUNITY. ALL THE OTHER ELEMENTS OF COMMUNITY AND AND BUSINESS AND THE LIKE ALL OF THIS IS IMPORTANT I'M JUST SEEING HERE AND SAY AND THIS IS A VERY CREATIVE WAY WITHOUT TAKING CASH OUT OF THE BUDGET. TO BE ABLE TO TO I WANTED TO SECURE TIES THIS ABOUT A BILLION DOLLARS OUT IN THE STREET IMMEDIATELY. THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT THAT BUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR AND BRACING BOLD ANYBODY IN NEEDS IT PRIORITIZE AREAS WITH HIS ROUTE WITH US ISSUES INVOLVING. OUR HIGHEST LEVEL OF RISK THIS IS CREATIVITY IT'S BEST. IT'S A WAY TO USE FINANCING AT A DIFFERENT LEVEL. I'M TELLING YOU AS AS SO I AM NOT LOOKING TO PUT ANYBODY IN HARM'S WAY WITH RESPECT TO THIS TAX ISSUE I THINK THAT IT WASN'T ANALYZED IN A PROPER WAY. I'M GONNA PUT EVERY BELL AND WHISTLE ON THERE TO MAKE SURE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN I THINK YOU'RE GONNA HEAR LEE HAD VERY PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY BECAUSE THEY RAISE A VERY IMPORTANT ISSUES. THAT WE AGREE TO NOBODY'S TRYING TO DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN FIGURE OUT A WAY. TO NOT. ONLY PEOPLE OUT OF MIGHT BE UPSET THE PEOPLE THAT A HUNDRED TWENTY INSURANCE CARRIERS FOR DIVIDE REINSURANCE BECAUSE WE'RE NOT GIVEN SO MUCH MONEY INTO THAT I'M SAYING I'M SORRY LADIES AND GENTLEMAN. AND ALSO THOSE ARTICLES THAT SHOW THEY GOT PLENTY REINSURANCE MARKET YES WHAT WE'RE GONNA TAKE THE SAVINGS ON THE PREMIUM AND WE'RE GONNA GET TE FOLKS IN THE FORM OF THREE THOUSAND DOLLAR BRANDS. TO BE ABLE TO BRACE AND BOLD YOUR HOMES AND WITH THAT. I'D LIKE TO TURN THIS OVER TO THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER FOR HIS OF THOUGHTFUL REMARKS. WELCOME NINE THIRTY HERE THANK YOU GOOD TO SEE YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS -- AGAIN WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SEE -- COMING THIS YEAR IN TERMS OF THE THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING TRYING TO JOIN THE DEPARTMENT OF INSURANCE AS HOW WE BEING CREATIVE WHEN IT COMES TO USING. CURRENT MARKET MARKET MECHANISMS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE MAJOR ISSUES THAT WE ARE GOING TO EVENTUALLY FACE -- THAT ARE HAVING TO DEAL WITH KEPT CATASTROPHES AND JUST TO REMIND. OUR COMMITTEE HERE IS THE REASON WE FIND OURSELVES IN THE SITUATION WAS BECAUSE AFTER THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE WE THEN MOVED TO HEAVILY REGULATE. THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WHEN I CAME TO THE PRODUCTS THEY WERE SELLING WHEN THEY CAME TO EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AND WHAT WE HAVE NOW IS. A MARKET THAT HAS LARGELY ABANDONED CALIFORNIA BECAUSE THE FACT THAT IT WAS JUST NOT VIABLE TO DO THIS TYPE OF PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA. IT LEADS US. TO BE CREATIVE AND HOW WE NOW APPROACH THE SITUATION WHICH IS DIRE WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN THE NEXT TIME WE HAVE A MASSIVE EARTHQUAKE. PRETTY MUCH AS WHICH THAT NOW PEOPLE GONNA BE LEFT TO THEIR OWN DEVICES. NOT ENOUGH PEOPLE HAVE THE PRODUCTS TO BE ABLE TO PROTECT THEM FULLY BE PROTECTED WHEN IT COMES. TO PROTECTING YOUR HOME AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE AND THAT'S JUST THE REALITY SO THIS IS ONE ATTEMPT TO TRY TO GET US TO MODERNIZE AN EXISTING PROGRAM. THAT WE FEEL IS IMPORTANT AND AGAIN AS SENATOR HERTZBERG MENTIONED WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE USE DATA -- AND SCIENCE TO BACK UP WITH A HOMES THAT WOULD BE PRIORITIZE IN THIS OF THE NEED A CERTAIN TIME OF WHEN THEY WERE BUILT. IF THEY'RE CLOSER TO OF EARTHQUAKE FAULT -- THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THE THINGS THAT WE SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IMMEDIATELY BECAUSE WE KNOW THOSE ARE THE FOLKS THAT ARE MORE AT RISK. AND AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO WE IN BE CREATIVE AND EMBRACE IS DUE TO THESE NEW PROGRAMS WE ALSO UNDERSTAND. THAT WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT WE HAVE NOW TO BE ABLE TO MODERNIZE TO BE ABLE TO BE MORE CREATIVE WHAT THE RESOURCES WE CURRENTLY HAVE. AND HOPEFULLY A TO ROCK MORE FOLKS TO COME IN AND PROVIDE THESE INNOVATIVE SERVICES FOR CALIFORNIANS BECAUSE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO EVENTUALLY NEEDED -- AND THE ARGUMENTS WHETHER THIS IS TAX OR NOT. THESE ARE CONVERSATIONS WE WANT TO CONTINUE HAVING I'VE COMMITTED TO SENATOR HERTZBERG INTO YOU MADAM CHAIR THAT WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO USE. THAT KNOWLEDGE OF OUR DEPARTMENT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE DISCUSSIONS IF THE BILL SHOULD MOVE FORWARD IN THE FISCAL COMMITTEE. SO THAT WE ARE CONTINUE HAVE THESE DIALOGUES WITH THE OPPOSITION WE UNDERSTAND THAT THERE IS SOME LEGITIMATE OPPOSITION FROM OF THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY WANT. TO BE ABLE TO WORK COLLABORATIVE WITH THEM TO ADDRESS AS MANY AS WE CAN BUT THE FACT IS THAT YOU KNOW WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING. WE NEED SOMETHING CREATIVELY AND I THINK WHAT -- SEE A HAS BROUGHT TO THE TABLE AND WORKING WITH OUR DEPARTMENT -- IS SOMETHING HAT WE SHOULD MERIT FURTHER DISCUSSION AND DIALOGUE AS YOU CAN TO TRY TO HELP FIGURE OUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MEET THIS TREMENDOUS DEMAND IN NEED -- WHEN THE NEXT EARTHQUAKE HITS CALIFORNIA? THANK YOU YOU MAY RECEIVE. COMMITTEE MEMBERS OF GLEN PALMER THE CEO OF THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE BEFORE YOU AND APPEARING WITH. HER SPRING COMMISSIONER LARA. THE NORTHRIDGE EARTHQUAKE BROUGHT THE CALIFORNIA HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET TO A STANDSTILL. THE CALIFORNIA COULD BUY OR SELL A HOME BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET HOMEOWNERS COVERAGE. THE LEGISLATURE FORM THE NOT FOR PROFIT CA TO RESOLVE THIS CRISIS. OUR GOVERNING BOARD THE GOVERNOR INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND TREASURE OVERSEE OUR PUBLIC MISSION. MAKE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE AS AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE AS POSSIBLE. AND HELP HOMEOWNERS PREPARE THE MITIGATION. NOW WITH LOWER RATES AND MORE FLEXIBLE POLICIES WE SURE MORE THAN A MILLION HOMES. AND OUR EARTHQUAKE BRACE SYMBOL PROGRAM PROVIDES THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS TO ABOUT TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS EACH YEAR TO HELP THEM RETROFIT THEIR HOME. THESE RETROFITS BY THE WAY COST ABOUT THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED DOLLARS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND ON AVERAGE ABOUT FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED IN THE NORTH. ALL CALIFORNIANS ALL CALIFORNIANS WITH A QUALIFYING HOMES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR A GRANTS NOT JUST SEE POLICY HOLDERS OF THE SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED BETTER FITS THAT WE HAVE FUNDED SO FAR. ALMOST SIX THOUSAND WERE FOR HOMES THAT ARE NOT INSURED WITH CA. BUT THERE ARE OVER ONE MILLION HOMES THAT NEED THIS BASIC RETROFIT AND MILLIONS OF OTHER TYPES OF RESIDENTIAL HOMES -- IT WE HAVE NOT YET BEEN ABLE TO ADDRESS DUE TO LIMITED FUNDING. SENATOR HERTZBERG BILL WOULD EXPONENTIALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER RICH OFFENSE CA COULD FIND EVERY YEAR. HOW? BY LETTING US REDUCE HOW MUCH WE SPEND ON REINSURANCE. SO THAT THAT MONEY COULD BE SPENT INSTEAD ON RETROFITTING HOMES. SAYS WE WERE FOR WE HAVE SPENT ABOUT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ON REINSURANCE WHILE RECEIVING BACK. TOTAL TO A FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN CLAIMS PAID. WITH THIS BILL WE WOULD SAY BETWEEN SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR AND THAT AMOUNT WOULD BE DIRECTED DIRECTLY. TO RETROFITTING HOMES IN HIGH SEISMIC AREAS. AT THE SAFETY NET FOR THE CA WOULD BE SET UP. IF WE HAVE A MASSIVE HISTORIC EARTHQUAKE ONE TWICE AS DAMAGING AS NORTHRIDGE FOR EXAMPLE THE SEABOARD COULD AUTHORIZE A SMALL ASSESSMENT. ABOUT 1% ON CERTAIN TYPES OF INSURANCE POLICIES IN HIGH SEISMIC AREAS THE PROBABILITY. OF A 1% ASSESSMENT IS EXTREMELY SMALL. ONE THIRD OF 1%. IT WOULD TAKE A HISTORIC MEGA EARTHQUAKE TO TRIGGER THE MAXIMUM 5% ASSESSMENT AND THE PROBABILITY OF THAT IS ALMOST ZERO LITERALLY. LESS THAN ONE FIFTH OF 1%. ANY ASSESSMENT HOWEVER UNLIKELY WOULD ONLY A TEST POLICIES IN HIGH SEISMIC AREAS. HAVE THE COUNTIES IN A IN THIS EARTHQUAKE PRONE STATE. AND THOSE HIGH SEISMIC AREAS ARE EXACTLY WHERE SAVINGS AND REINSURANCE WILL BE INVESTED. TO THE BILL COMMUNITIES ARE MORE RESILIENT TO A CATASTROPHIC EARTHQUAKE. SO. WHAT DO YOU CALL A POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT THAT IS ALMOST CERTAINLY NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN? A NINETY NINE POINT 7% PROBABILITY THAT NO ONE WILL EVER PAY EVEN A 1% ASSESSMENT. IS THAT A TAX. SOME SAY IT IS. BUT IF YOU CONSIDER THAT JUST THE EXISTENCE OF THAT POTENTIAL ASSESSMENT WILL IMMEDIATELY FREE UP BETWEEN SEVENTY AND ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS EACH YEAR. SO WE CAN MAKE OUR HOMES AND OUR COMMUNITIES BETTER PREPARED FOR THE EARTHQUAKES THAT SITE TO SAY ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO HAPPEN. WOULD YOU CALL THAT. I CALL IT AN AMAZING OPPORTUNITY. WITH YOUR HELP WE CAN LAUNCH THE MOST AGGRESSIVE RESIDENTIAL SEISMIC RETROFIT PROGRAM IN THE WORLD. AND WHEN THE NEXT DAMAGING EARTHQUAKE HITS ONE BIG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SERIOUS DAMAGE. BUT ONE AT THE END ONE FAR MORE LIKELY THAN HE MEGA QUAKE HE WOULD TAKE TO TRIGGER AN ASSESSMENT. YOU MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE WILL HAVE THE SATISFACTION OF KNOWING THAT YOU HELPED TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIANS. BE BETTER PREPARED TO SURVIVE AND RECOVER FROM THAT EARTHQUAKE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. YEAH. SO IS THERE ANYBODY ELSE THAT WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT PLEASE. STATE YOUR NAME. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR DUNGEONS COME BEHALF OF THIS -- STRUCTURAL ENGINEERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT. YOU HAVE TO ENSURE COMMITTEE MEMBERS BLAKE JOHNSON HIM HAVE STATES HAS A FEW ON A Mà RECKLESS IT'S ON THE CA BOARD HERE IN SHOCK SUPPORT. GOOD AFTERNOON SEVEN TAYLOR FOR THE PERSONAL INSURANCE FEDERATION IN SUPPORT. WE THINK THIS BILL WILL STRENGTHEN THE CA IS CAPITAL STRUCTURE MAKING A MORE RESILIENT. AND ALLOWING PARTICIPATING INSURERS TO OFFER MORE RELIABLE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE THANK YOU YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE GERMANS MET HERE ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL ALSO SUPPORT. MORNING ARE GOOD AFTERNOON CARE ACROSS ON BEHALF A. I. R. WORLDWIDE. PLEASE SUPPORT BECAUSE OF THE INVESTMENT IN MEDICATION THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS MADISON BY ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN RED CROSS IN SUPPORT. THE TOURIST TOUR WITH FARMERS INSURANCE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU IS THERE ANYONE IS AS AN OPPOSITION THAT WISHED TO SPEAK PLEASE COME UP AT THIS TIME THANK YOU. WELCOME. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIRWOMAN MEMBERS SHERRY MCCUE REPRESENTING THE PACIFIC ASSOCIATION DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES UNFORTUNATELY WE ARE HERE TODAY IN OPPOSITION SB TWO FIFTY FOUR UNLESS IT IS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE NON PARTICIPATING IN SURE -- ASSESSMENT. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT PATRICK IS NOT OPPOSED TO ENHANCING THE BRACE BOLT PROGRAM WE ARE STRONGLY IN SUPPORT OF DOING SO. I WITH THAT BEING SAID WE HAD CONVERSATIONS I'VE LAST NIGHT WITH THE AUTHOR AND WITH THE SEE A REPRESENTATIVES. ABOUT OUR CONCERNS -- WE AGREED TO CONTINUE TO DISCUSS INNOVATIVE WAYS TO MODERNIZE THE CIA'S FINANCIAL STRUCTURE -- SO THAT THE PROGRAM COULD BE EXPANDED. WHAT IS OF CONCERN WITH SB TWO FIFTY FOUR AS IN PRINT IS AT THE CA WANTS TO EXPAND THE BRACE SYMBOL PROGRAM BY ALTERING THE VERY FOUNDATION UPON WHICH TO SEE A WAS CREATED? BY AUTHORIZING THE C. H. TO IMPOSE AN ASSESSMENT ON POLICY HOLDERS OF NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS. A CRITICAL PRINCIPLE WHEN THE CA WAS CREATED WAS AT NINE P. EYES PARTICIPATING INSURERS. WOULD HAVE NO FINANCIAL OBLIGATION TO SUPPORT TO SEE EA. AND IN ORDER TO PROTECT THE PRODUCT THE PARTICIPATING INSURERS AND THEY'RE VERY SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL -- COMMITMENT TO THE C. E. A. NON OF PARTICIPATING INSURERS WOULD HAVE NO ACCESS TO THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. EVER. THESE VERY TWO DISTINCT SILOS WERE BY DESIGN AND AGREED TO BY THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY WHEN TO SEE A WAS CREATED. THE AUTHOR AND SPONSOR HAVE ASKED NOT PARTICIPATE INSURERS TO THINK OUTSIDE THE SEE A BOX. AND OUTSIDE OF OUR COMFORT ZONE IN ORDER TO MODERNIZE THE C. A.'S FINANCIAL STRUCTURE. WELL THIS IDEA MAKES MANY PEOPLE VERY NERVOUS AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE. WE ARE WILLING TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS TO SEE IF THERE'S A WAY. TO EXPAND RESEMBLED. THAT IS ACCEPTABLE TO BOTH PARTICIPATE INSURERS AND NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS. IN THE MEANTIME AS LONG AS IT IS ALL ON THE NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS WE WILL REMAIN STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JOHN NOR INDEPENDENT INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS OF CALIFORNIA. CALIFORNIA TERMS WHOLESALERS ASSOCIATION ZENITH INSURANCE COMPANY AND FIRST AMERICAN CORPORATION. OUR CLIENTS RIGHT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE IN THE STATE. BUT THE GREAT MAJORITY OF COMMERCIAL INSURANCE ON SMALL AND LARGE BUSINESSES IN YOUR DISTRICT TRANSPORTATION MANUFACTURING CONSTRUCTION EXCEPT FOR ALMOST ANYTHING THAT MOVES ARE FLIES -- THIS BILL PROPOSES CAN MAKE SOME UNPRECEDENTED CHANGES TO THE INSURANCE CODE -- THEY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR MEMBERS THEY INCLUDE CROSS SUBSIDIZATION. MULTIPLE SUSPECTS ASSESSMENTS ON LINES OF INSURANCE AND NEVER PREVIOUSLY BEEN ASSESSED. CHANGES DANGER SOME OF OF THE FUTURE OF OUR MEMBERSHIP AND IS SHERRY JUST INDICATED A BREAKDOWN BETWEEN THE SILOS OF DISOBEYING INSURERS AND NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS. OR JUST NOT TALKING ABOUT HERE. ASSESSING OTHER HOMEOWNERS THAT ARE NON PARTICIPATING THEY ARE THE POLICY HOLDERS OF NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT ASSESSING AN ENTIRE -- COMMERCIAL IN PERSONAL LINES BUSINESS IN THE STATE. BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF INSURANCE -- YOU THE DETAILS OF GOING THROUGH. EACH OF THESE CONCERNS BECAUSE MOST OF MORE COVERED IN YOUR EXCELLENT. COMMITTEE ANALYSIS IN OUR LETTER OF OPPOSITION WE SHARED A NUMBER OF THEM WITH YOU FROM A PERSONAL STANDPOINT -- HEAD OUT IN TALKING TO YOU OR YOUR OR YOUR STAFF PUT SIMPLY SAID -- OUR OUR MEMBERS JUST CANNOT BY THE CONCEPT THAT THEY SHOULD ACCEPT -- UNPRECEDENTED CHANGES THAT HAD TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THEM. ON THE THEORY THAT THIS IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. YOU KEEP HEARING THAT THIS IS NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN. THE GOVERNOR -- IN HIS PRESS CONFERENCE JUST WEAKER SO TEN DAYS AGO OR SOMETHING I REMEMBER A GRAPH THAT HE HAD UP ON THE BOARD SHOWING THAT. THE FIREFIGHTING COSTS AND TO pFOURTEEN TO FIFTEEN I THINK WAS ABOUT THAT BIG GOES A FEW HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. TO SEVENTEEN TO EIGHTEEN WAS TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WE REALLY DIDN'T THINK THAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN. I MEAN THE P. YOU SEE EVERY -- SERVICE ORGANIZATION THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY USES ALL HAD FIRE MAPS WRONG ED EVERYTHING WRONG SO ARE WE GOING TO PAN ON THE FACT THAT. NOBODY ELSE IS GOING TO BE ASSESSED BECAUSE OF YOU KNOW WHAT AN ACTUAL ACTUAL REASONS. THAT'S THE THE PROBLEM FROM OUR STANDPOINT WITH WITH THIS -- AS SHERRI INDICATED WE HAD A MEETING LAST NIGHT WITH THE AUTHOR AND THE THE SPONSORS OF THE BILL I WOULD TERM IT IS A BLUE. SKIES SESSION -- WE THROW A LOT OF THINGS OUT THERE -- WERE WILLING TO THE OTHER OPTIONS OTHER THINGS ARE A MORE DIRECT WAY TO DO THIS WITHOUT KIND OF A HIDDEN ASSESSMENT -- AND WE'RE GOING TO TALK ABOUT THOSE IF THE BILL MOVES OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE BUT WE HAVE. I JUST I CAN'T UNDER ESTIMATE THE CONCERNS THAT OUR CLIENTS HAVE. AND IT'S OUR CLIENTS ARE THE FACE OF THIS INDUSTRY -- WHEN THEY'RE CHARGING SOMEBODY ARE COLLECTING? TENS OF THOUSANDS OF DOLLARS AND MORE PREMIUM FROM THEIR CUSTOMERS THEY'RE THE ONES THERE'S GOING TO TAKE THE GRIEF WHEN THEY GO BACK TO COLLECT. AN ASSESSMENT AT SOME POINT AND THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE WORRIED ABOUT THEY'RE ALSO WORRIED ABOUT CHANGES OR WE'RE GONNA MAKE IN THE COLOR THAT OTHER PEOPLE FUTURE LEGISLATORS WILL CALL WILL GRAB ON TO AND SAY WELL WE DO THIS TODAY. EVEN THOUGH IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN SO LET'S DO THIS LET'S DO A LITTLE BIT MORE LIST TO A LITTLE BIT MORE. SO THOSE ARE CONCERNS THERE'S ONE LAST POINT IS I THINK IN OUR LETTER THOUGH HE SAID THIS THIS LEGISLATION SAYS. THERE CAN ASSESS EVERYTHING UNDER. INSURANCE CODE. ONE HUNDRED I'M EXCEPT THE ONES THAT ARE EXCLUDED NOW THERE'S NO EXCLUSIONS ARE THE SHOULDN'T BE EXCLUDED -- AUTO INSURANCE FOR INSTANCE IF YOU'RE GOING TO DO ASSESSMENTS. ALL THE PERSONAL ONES ASSESSMENT SHOULD BE DONE FIRST BECAUSE THIS IS A PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE BENEFITS PERSONAL LINES PEOPLE I MEAN IF YOU DON'T GRAYSON BOLTHOUSE FALL DOWN ON IF YOU'RE GOING TO ASSESS YOU KNOW INSURANCE. ON ACCOUNTANTS AND LAWYERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT YOU DON'T NOT A SAYS THAT ON ON DOCTORS BECAUSE MEDICAL MALPRACTICE IS SOMETHING THAT IS A SACRED AROUND HERE WE UNDERSTAND THAT. THE CHANGES HERE ARE NO DIFFERENT THAN CHANGING THE MEDIC MEDICAL MALPRACTICE CAP -- AT WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE THE ISSUES BETWEEN INSURERS AND WHO SHOULD -- SUBSIDIZE WHO AND WHO HAS CAPACITY READING THESE CHANGES BENEFIT THE PARTICIPATING IN TERMS THAT'S WHY THE RECORD SUPPORTING THE BILL. SO WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. WITH IN THOSE DIFFERENT THIRTEEN LINES OF INSURANCE THAT ARE GOING TO BE ASSESSED THEY'RE JUST TITLES WITHIN THOSE THERE ARE. OTHER OTHER INSURANCES AND OTHER KINDS OF INSURANCES ARE GOING TO BE ASSESSED -- HAPPY TO PASS AROUND BUT MARINE INSURANCE FOR INSTANCE THERE'S A PART OF MARINEINSURANCE THAT'S CALLED INLAND MARINE THAT'S FOR THE INDUSTRY. PUTS EVERYTHING THAT THEY DON'T KNOW WHERE ELSE TO PUT. IN THE THAT COVERS CYBERSECURITY IT COVERS ALL KINDS OF CONSTRUCTION RISK ALL KINDS OF TRANSFER STATION RULES TECHNOLOGY -- AND ENERGY ROSE -- MARITIME RISK ALL KINDS OF MARITIME RISKS THERE'S TWO POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF PREMIUM JUSTIN INLAND MARINE. COVERAGE WHICH IS A SUBSET OF MARINE IN THIS LIST OF THINGS ARE GOING TO BE A SOUTH STE. SO. I'M CERTAINLY WILLING TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THIS WE THINK THERE'S SOME OTHER OPTIONS ARE MORE DIRECT. AND WITHOUT ALL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MARC SEVEN WITH AMERICAN PROPERTY CASUALTY INSURANCE ASSOCIATION WAS SO SEE WHAT MY COMMENTS BY -- COLLEAGUES AS A STATE OF THIS IS A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES AMENDMENTS WERE RECENTLY DROPPED ON THE TWELFTH. THIS FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGES THE PROGRAM IT FUNDAMENTALLY INVOLVES THAT NON P. EYES TO BENEFIT THE PUT THE PARTICIPATING INSURERS. AND GREETS ADDITIONAL COMPETITIVE ISSUES FOR THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE THE BENEFITS OF A STATE RUN ORGANIZATION SUCH AS THE CA. THE THE OTHER THING WE NEED TO POINT OUT IS UNFORTUNATELY EARTHQUAKES ARE NOT CALIFORNIA'S ONLY CATASTROPHE. OUR OVER ALL VERY FAMILIAR ABOUT THE WILD FIRE RISK WE'RE ALL VERY FAMILIAR ABOUT THE GOVERNOR'S ALL WITHIN THE NEXT NINETY DAYS TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO BOTH BETTER MANAGE OUR FOR SENT TO FIGHT WILDFIRES. WITHIN THAT PLAN IS A RETROFIT PROGRAM WE ALSO KNOW THAT THE GOVERNOR'S HOUSE ALL EVERYBODY TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS AND THIS INCLUDES INSURANCE INDUSTRY. AND SO WILL A LOT WANT TO DO IS PROVIDE ENOUGH TIME FOR THIS BILL SO WE FULLY UNDERSTAND IT. AND ALSO THAT WE CAN INTEGRATE IT WITH WHATEVER THE LEGISLATURE THE GOVERNOR COME OUT DEAL WITH WILDFIRES TEACHER WITH THEM IN AN ANGRY INTEGRATED PLAN IN THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS NOT. OVERLY BURDENED BY TWO SEPARATE PROGRAMS IN TWO SEPARATE SS MEN SCHEMES THANK YOU. ANYBODY ELSE WISHING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE COME UP TO THE MIKE THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS PAUL THAT FILLED THE ON BEHALF OF TRAVELERS INSURANCE AND ALSO THE CALIFORNIA TREATY FEDERATION. REAL LATE TO THE GAME WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE CENTER HERTZBERG ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE AND JUST WANTED. TO EXPRESS OUR CONCERN. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR XING LEVINE ON BEHALF OF THE REINSURANCE ASSOCIATION AMERICAN OPPOSITION. THANK YOU. NOW I WILL OPEN IT UP TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS I BELIEVE MISTER SENATOR BORDERS YOU HAD A QUESTION. AND THEN WE'LL GO TO ASK GALGIANI. MR. LATER AND THEN MISTER ARCH LET. THIS IS COMPLICATED. REALLY ARE HI I TOOK A LOOK AT THIS AND I I PRIDE MYSELF ON MY ABILITY TO LEAST PICK UP ON THINGS FAIRLY QUICKLY AND AND AND I I JUST HAVEN'T QUITE YET SO. I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. THE COMMENT THAT YOU MADE THAT IT IS ESSENTIALLY TO FUND. THE COST OF A VERY EXPENSIVE REINSURANCE. PROGRAM DID I REMEMBER THAT CORRECTLY. WE BASICALLY WAS A SICKLY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE PAY EVERY YEAR BY BETWEEN SEVENTY AND A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND TAKING THE CASH FROM THE SAVINGS BACK LOSING THAT TO BRACE AND BOLTS. AT IT IN TERMS OF WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM INSTEAD OF TAX DOLLARS OR ASSESSMENTS ON ON RISK DON'T FORGET A BEAST LIKE ACTING LIKE TOMORROW THERE'S GOING TO BE AN ASSESSMENT. IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE AFTER ALL THESE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS HAVE BEEN SPENT IT'S QUICK AS TO BE SO BIG. YOU KNOW I MEAN IN TERMS OF HOW IT WORKS SO IT'S REALLY A LEGAL FICTION WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO CONFUSE FINANCIAL MECHANISM TO BE ABLE TO CREATE CASH. TO TO TO BE ABLE TO DO AS MUCH GRAYSON VOLTRON THE STATE OF POSSIBLE IN THIS RACE WE HAVE BETWEEN NOW WHEN AN EARTHQUAKE. SO I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND THE SO WE'RE USING THE THE THE VALUE OF THE REINSURANCE FUND TO INVEST HEAVILY INTO THE BRACE AND AND BOLD -- WE USING ABOUT LESS THAN A THIRD OF IT OKAY. WE'RE STILL HAVING REINSURANCE TO BE ABLE TO CREATE THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF THE SEVENTEEN STACK TO SEVENTEEN POINT SIX WE'RE JUST REDUCING THAT NUMBER AND THEN WE'RE PUTTING AT THE TOP SO WE GET TO SEVENTEEN POINT. SIX FOR A ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED YEAR EVENT HORIZON TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RATING AGENCIE. APPROVAL TO BE ABLE TO BORROW AT THAT TRIPLE A RATE. SO FOR CONVENIENCE AND I'M NOT ADVOCATING THIS BUT FOR CONVENIENCE. WE HAVE NON PARTICIPATING ENTITIES BEING DRAWN INTO THIS -- CORRECT CORRECT ON BOTH BY THE WAY ON BOTH SIDES OF THE TRADE WHAT YOU'RE HEARING IS THAT NON PARTICIPATING ENTITIES RIGHT. THEY'RE NOT PARTICIPATING BUT WHAT WHAT I BELIEVE CITED ON THE REASON WITH WITH THE SO A A COMMISSIONER LARA AND TREASURE A MARK. I TOOK THIS BILL ON IS BECAUSE WHAT'S DIFFERENT HERE THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT IS STACK WILL GUESS WHO'S AVOIDING THE STACK IT'S THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY. AND THEY'RE SAYING WE'RE GOING TO ALLOW PEOPLE WHO ARE NON PEOPLE THAT DON'T HAVE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. BECAUSE WE BELIEVE THE SOCIETAL STANDPOINT THE MORE PEOPLE THAT ARE BRACED IN BOLD THE BETTER CHANCE WE HAVE GOING FORWARD AS A SOCIETY. EVERYBODY GETS. ACCESS TO THE BRAZEN BOWL PROGRAM YOU CAN BE ASSURED IN THE PROGRAM YOU AN BE SURE OTHER PROGRAM OR YOU COULD NOT INSURED AT ALL WHAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BY THE WAY AND I I LOVE THE FACT THAT WHEN YOU SWING YOU SWING FOR THE FENCE HERTZBERG. GOD BLESS YOU -- WHAT WHY WOULDN'T WHY WOULDN'T IT BE? A MANDATORY. A SCENARIO FOR MANDATORY COVERAGE. SO IF WE'RE LOOKING CRITICAL ZONES THAT ARE VULNERABLE IT WHETHER THEY BE EARTHQUAKE WHETHER THEY BE FIRE. THAT THERE NOT BE A MANDATORY COVERAGE. FOR ALL THOSE THAT -- PURCHASE OR OWN -- PROPERTIES IN THOSE AREAS DOES THAT NOT ALONE IF YOU HAD A MANDATORY SYSTEM WITH THAT NOT ALLOW FOR THAT REINSURANCE BOTHERED THAT THE THE ARCHITECTURE OF THE FOUR CORNERS OF THE DEAL THAT WAS EXPRESSED THAT HAPPENED TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO. WAS THE IDEA THAT HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKETS WERE JUST BLOWN UP OKAY. AND SO WE CAME UP WITH THIS IDEA OF THE EARTH REGULATORY AND YOU COULD BE A PARTICIPATING OR NON PARTICIPATING. IF YOU'RE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T WANT TO BUY THE INSURANCE I FEEL A BUSINESS QUITE FRANKLY LOTS OF BUSINESSES YOUR LENDERS REQUIRE YOU TO BUY. RIGHT BUT IF I'M SOMEBODY THERE'S NO REQUIREMENT EXCEPT FOR MAYBE DRIVING YOU'D HAVE INSURANCE TO DRIVE RIGHT THAT YOU HAVE INSURANCE ON YOUR BUILDING IS YOUR ASSET YOU COULD DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT. UNLESS THERE'S A LENDER OR AGAIN JUST LIKE WITH RESPECT TO DRIVING IS A PUBLIC POLICY REASON WHY YOU HAVE INSURANCE SO I SUSPECT THAT. THE SAME PEOPLE THAT ARE OPPOSING THIS NOW I DON'T KNOW OTHER PUT NEW PEOPLE OPPOSE IT BECAUSE IF YOU ONLY AND THEY THAT SHARON'S. YEAH AND WE WE HAD THIS TO DISCUSSION THANK YOU WE HAVE THIS DISCUSSION WITH HEALTHCARE. EVERYTHING WHEN IT COMES TO SOCIETAL COVERAGE IS BASED ON VOLUME AND WHAT YOU'RE ACHIEVING IS VOLUME. FOR THOSE THAT ARE NOT EVEN IT NECESSARILY -- DISSIPATING I'M WONDERING IF THE VOLUME OF MANDATING PARTICIPATION WHICH SHE THE SAME END WHILE STILL ALLOWING -- THAT -- NUTS AND BOLTS ARE GRAYSON BLAKE SYMBOL [inaudible] GRAHAM -- TO TO TO MOVE FORWARD. GIVE ANY THOUGHT I I DON'T I MEAN I IT'S A GIGANTIC LEE DIFFERENT ISSUE. THAT SWING IN FOR THE THE STRATOSPHERE BECAUSE IF YOU'RE NOW IT RAISES SO MANY LEGAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES TO MANDATE SOMEBODY TO HAVE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE ON THEIR PROPERTY. INVITE ICAL ZONES. WELL YOU COULD ARGUE FOREVER REASONS CRITICAL ZONES OR WHATEVER CRITICAL ZONES I USUALLY RAISE A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES WE'RE TRYING TO DO. IN THE SCHEME OF SWING FOR THE FENCES THE CLOSE FENCES AND JUST BEING CREATIVE FINANCIALLY TO BE ABLE TO IN THE AREA WHERE THE RISK IS NOT GONE OF COURSE I WE'VE ALL LIVED THROUGH THE PERFECT STORM AROUND HERE. BUT IT'S A REMOTE COST VERSUS A DIRECT IMMEDIATE BENEFIT OF AN IMPENDING PROBLEM WATER WE DO. I CERTAIN SITTING IN THIS JOB AND SAYING YOU KNOW I WANT TO EVERYTHING I CAN'T IT'S HARD BECAUSE NO CONSTITUENCY FOR THE FUTURE UNTIL IT BLOWS UP AND EVERYBODY RUNS AROUND SAYS OH MY GOD ON FIXING THE PROBLEM. WORK THIS TO ME IS A THOUGHT FOR THE WAY IF WE GET TWENTY YEARS OF THIS STUFF RIGHT THERE MILLION HOUSES. YOU GOT MILLION HOUSES YOU'VE SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED SOMETHING THAT AFFECTS SOCIETY ACROSS THE BOARD NOW YOU CAN OF EARTHQUAKE AND SEVEN MINUTES FROM NOW. IN WHAT WE'RE VOTING ON THIS BILL. RIGHT. THAT IS THE IRONIC BUT THAT WOULD NOT BE GOOD. BUT THE POINT IS YOU NEVER KNOW AND OUR JOB IS TO GET AHEAD OF THE GAME FIGURE IT OUT. I THINK WHAT THEY'VE COME UP WITH THE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER THE THAT THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY IS PRETTY BRILLIANT. AND I'M WILLING TO SWING FROM THE FENCES THE PUSH IT GIVEN THE CONSTRAINED ABOUT THE TAX STUFF THAT I'M TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE I THINK THAT THE LEGAL OPINIONS. ARE WRONG AND IF NOT I WANT TO PUT WHAT'S CALLED A VALIDATION ACTION THAT SAYS BECAUSE I WANT TO PUT PEOPLE IN HARM'S WY BECAUSE I DON'T THINK THIS WERE ABOUT HERE TAX IS A DIRECT RELATIONSHIP. OF I MET EXTRACTING MONEY FROM SOMEBODY FOR GOVERNMENT PURPOSES I'M EXTRACTING A HYPOTHETICAL AMOUNT OF MONEY AFTER ALL OF THESE THINGS WITH A RISK PROFILE IS SO LOW. I'M NOT SO SURE THAT'S WHAT THAT MEANS BUT I I I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO IT. AND I'M NOT GONNA RUN PEOPLE TO THE WALL OVER. ALL IN ALL IN HERE -- I WANT TO CERTAINLY STUDY THIS -- I THINK IT IS VERY INTERESTING -- I THINK THAT YOUR CONCERN ABOUT EARTHQUAKES IS WHAT I SHARE ABOUT WILDFIRES. IN THE CENTRAL IN INTERIOR OF CALIFORNIA -- THE AND SO IS WE LOOK UPON THIS WE'RE LOOKING AT THE SAME. THE THE THE SAY THE SAME ISSUE -- PLEASE BY ANALOGY THE ONLY DIFFERENCE I WOULD SUGGEST IS THE ARGUMENT THAT WAS MADE IS THAT THERE'S GONNA BE PREMIUM COST NEXT YEAR ON WILD FIRE INSURANCE. UNDER THIS PROPOSAL THERE IS NO PREMIUM COST UNTIL A THERE'S AN EVENT. BE BECAUSE THE IDEA OF INSURANCE UP FRONT IS TO PROTECT IT BE IT HAS TO BE BIGGER THAN FIFTEEN BILLION BOX. RIGHT AND SEE IT'S CONTINGENT WHICH WHAT THAT NUMBER IS WE DON'T REALLY KNOW AND THERE'S A LOT INTERVENING FACTORS WITH THERWISE A CAR. TO ME IT'S JUST SMART FINANCIAL PLANNING AT A PLACE WHERE WE'RE NOT SPENDING CASH SAVING CASH AND USING THE SAVINGS TO PROTECT CALIFORNIA'S ALMOST AS IF YOU ARE CREATING. A CATASTROPHE IN CASUALTY SUPER FUND. THAT MAYBE SHOULD NOT HOLD HEAR ME OUT. THAT SHOULD NOT THAT SHOULD NOT BE TRIGGERED BUT ONLY UPON. BAD EVENT SO YOU TALKED ABOUT THAT NEXUS. THAT'S WHAT HAPPENS IT DOES YES A GOOD LIST OF AND HOW EXACTLY SO I'M WONDERING IT WAS IT CONTEMPLATED BY THE AUTHOR -- THAT THIS ONLY BE LIMITED. TO EARTHQUAKES I ENDED DID YOU THINK THROUGH OTHER SCENARIOS CATASTROPHIC FLOODS OF CATASTROPHIC FIRES. THAT'S THE ONE IN SUPER FUN WELL YOU KNOW EMERGENCY SUPER THING YOU COULD DO THAT I HAD THAT DISCUSSION WITH THE INSURANCE FOLKS YESTERDAY. AND YOU KNOW THERE'S THE BAND WITHIN THE LEGISLATURE TO SOCIALIZE ALL COSTA BOSS THE BOARD. I THINK IT'S I THINK THAT THE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY GIVES. TWO THINGS ONE IS A VERY DIFFERENT DYNAMIC BECAUSE IT'S AN EXISTING MATURE TWENTY FIVE YOUR ENTITY WITH A LOT OF CASH IN THE BANK. AND UP THE PRE EXISTING PROGRAM TO THE PRE EXISTING PROGRAM IS TO FIND A BRACE AND BOWL THREE MITIGATION IN ALL THESE OTHER FIELDS. YOU YOU START DEFINING WHAT THAT MEANS IN FIRE AND CUTTING DOWN THIS AND DOING THAT WHAT'S COVERED AND WHAT'S NOT COVERED. YOU OF TEN THOUSAND COVERAGE LAWYERS TRYING T FIGURE IT OUT. AND SO THE CONSEQUENCES IT DOESN'T REALLY COMPARE APPLES TO APPLES TO ME IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A CURVE BALL. IT DOESN'T REALLY DIRECT WHAT WENT ON THIS SITUATION YOU HAVE A VERY DIRECT DYNAMIC IN THE EXISTING MATURE ORGANIZATION. EVIDENCE IS A WILLINGNESS TO EXTEND IT TO OTHERS IN A VERY DIRECT. LIMITED CIRCUMSTANCES BUT IF WE COULD CREATE A LARGER POOL IN THAT REGARD IT'S ULTIMATELY GOING TO HAPPEN BUT I DO THINK THAT. WHETHER IT'S FIRES OR MUDSLIDES OR ALL THESE OTHER DYNAMICS. THOSE THINGS YOU CAN'T FIGURE OUT A SHORT WINDOW THIS TO ME YOU CAN START THIS PROCESS AND IN TWO YEARS NOW IF YOU DIDN'T LIKE IT YOU COULD SHUT OFF AND THEY GO NOT A BIG DEAL AND THERE'S NEVER ANY RISK. YOU CAN PUT A COUPON AT EIGHT SOME KIND OF LIMITATION ON IT I THINK I JUST WANT TO TRY TO GET AS MANY HOUSES BOLTED AS POSSIBLE. WITH CREATIVE FINANCING AND THEY'RE WILLING TO DO IT AND THEY'RE SMART ABOUT IT. IT DOESN'T WORK YOU KNOW IT DOESN'T WORK BETTER I SHOULD ON THE ROOMS AND IT'S GREAT. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH I LOOK FORTY TWO DIVING AND THIS IS I FIND VERY INTERESTING VERY INTERESTING IN THIS CREATIVE. THANK YOU OUR SENATOR GALGIANI -- FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR -- THIS IS A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT ISSUE AND I WAS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WHEN. THE EARTHQUAKE OCCURRED YES I WAS SIGNED SYMPATHETIC TO IT -- BUT I APPROACH THIS WITH SOME SKEPTICISM AND I I WANTED TO SHOW YOU THE LENS THAT THAT I'M LOOKING AT THIS BILL FROM. NOW ON MY DISTRICT WE HAVE SEVENTEEN HUNDRED MILES OF LEVEE AND SELL HOMEOWNERS AND SACRAMENTO AND SAN JOAQUIN COUNTIES HAVE TO BUY FLOOD INSURANCE BECAUSE WE'RE AT RISK. IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN WE SUFFERED A CATASTROPHIC FLOOD AND MANY INDIVIDUALS LOST THEIR HOMES THERE WERE MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN CROP DAMAGE. SINCE THAT TIME THERE BEEN MORE HOMES BUILT AND THE FOR THE AREA THAT WAS FLOODED IN. NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN BUT WHAT THE LEGISLATURE DID THERE ARE A COUPLE THINGS THAT HAPPENED. ONE THE FEDS HAVE SENSE REQUIRED THAT HOMEOWNERS AN THESE FLOOD ZONES ARE REQUIRED REQUIRED TO PURCHASE FLOOD INSURANCE. AND THEY CANNOT PURCHASE A HOME UNLESS THEY HAVE IT -- MINE COST ME CLOSE TO FOUR HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR IT'S NOT TOO MUCH BUT I I PAY AS A THAT'S BECAUSE THE BANK RECORDS CENTER. DO YOU WANT TO BUY WITHOUT FLOOD INSURANCE IF YOU PAY CASH YOU WOULD HAVE TO BUY IT. BUT I KNOW I LIVE IN A FLOOD ZONE SO I WANT TO PROTECT MYSELF. ALSO WANT TO PROTECT MYSELF -- THE SECOND THING THAT HAPPENED WAS THAT. PASSED THE SENATE BILL FIVE IN EITHER TWO THOUSAND SEVEN OR TWO THOUSAND EIGHT AND IT SAID THAT OKAY WE RECOGNIZE THAT IN CERTAIN AREAS OF THE STATE THERE. THEY ARE FLOOD ZONES AND IF BUILDERS WANT TO CONTINUE TO BUILD IN THOSE FLOOD ZONES. AND CITY GOVERNMENTS COUNTY GOVERNMENTS WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVE DEVELOPMENT IN THESE HIGH RISK AREAS THEN THERE NEEDS TO BE A A TIME LINE. AND THEIR LEAD NEEDS TO BE -- REQUIRE A STEP PROCESS WHERE THE BUILDERS IN THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS COME UP WITH THE PROCESS BY WHICH THEY CAN ENSURE THAT ANY NEW CONSTRUCTION. WOULD NOT BE PLACING NEW HOMEOWNERS. AT GREAT RISK SO IN OTHER WORDS THERE WOULD HAVE TO BE A PLAN TO MAKE SURE THAT ANY OF THE NEW HOMES AND A HIGH RISK AREA. WOULD HAVE TO BE -- BUILT IN SUCH A WAY THAT THEY WOULD ABSOLUTELY NOT BE AT RISK SO -- WHAT I'M I'M LOOKING FOR IN THIS I HAVE SOME QUESTIONS BUT THAT'S MY MINDSET AND I'M WONDERING? THAT YOU KNOW WHILE THERE'S THIS ASSESSMENT THAT SEEMS SEEMS KIND OF OPEN ENDED MAYBE IT'S IS IT TEN YEARS IT WOULD GO AWAY. ASSESSMENT AFTER THERE WAS A GIGANTIC EARTHQUAKE IT WOULD BE THE LAST PART OF MONEY TOUCH. IF IT GOT HIT AND THEN IT WOULD LAST OKAY UP TO TEN OKAY SO SO I'M JUST I'M WONDERING IF THERE'S ANYTHING IN THE BILL. THAT WOULD ENSURE THAT. GOING FORWARD WE WOULDN'T BE DOING THE KINDS OF CONSTRUCTION AND THAT WOULD. PLACE HOMEOWNERS AT SUCH A RISK IF THERE WERE AN EVENT IN OTHER WORDS THE THE YOU SHOW ME PICTURES OF THE STRUCTURES THAT REQUIRE THE BRAZEN BOLT. IS THERE ANYTHING THAT WOULD PROHIBIT THAT KIND OF CONSTRUCTION GOING FORWARD WHEN WE KNOW THAT UNLESS WE PUT MORE MONEY TOWARD IT WE'RE GONNA JUST FIND HERSELF AN EXACT SAME SITUATIONAL OVER AGAIN. YES THERE IS AND THAT IS THAT THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND LEGISLATURE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY A FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE CONSTRUCTION STANDARDS. AND SO THE FOCUS OF THIS MEASURE OUR HOUSES PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY SO THIS ONE POINT TWO MILLION HOMES PLUS WE HAVE THE TOTAL FIVE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN APARTMENT BUILDINGS. SO THE NOTION IS GOING FORWARD JUST LIKE WITH YOUR FLOOD ZONES WE HAVE PROTECTED THAT JUST LIKE WE'VE DONE THING WITH WATER CONSERVATION HOMES AND FIRE DETECTORS AND CARBON MONOXIDE DETECTORS WE HAVE FIXED THE LAW IN THAT WAY. THE PURPOSE OF THIS MY HOUSE WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FORTY EIGHT SO -- THE THE IDEA IS THAT GOOD THESE HOUSES THE ONE POINT TWO MILLION HOMES THAT ARE THAT SO MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN AND ALL THE APARTMENT BUILDINGS. WE'RE LOOKING TO THE STORK A CIRCUMSTANCE WHERE THEY DON'T HAVE THE LEVEL OF PROTECTION SO THE ANSWER ELECT YOU'RE LOOKING AT IN TERMS OF FLOODS. WE'VE BEEN SMART ABOUT IT THIS IS GOING BACKWARDS NOT FORWARDS BECAUSE SO MANY PEOPLE LIVE IN OLDER HOMES. OKAY AND IS GO AHEAD COULD YOU JUST -- MAKE ONE QUICK POINT AND THIS BILL ALL THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BILL. WOULD ONLY APPLY IN COUNTY THAT ARE DEEMED HIGH SEISMIC RISK I BELIEVE. FORTUNATELY FOR YOU I BELIEVE YOU'RE YOU'RE DISTRICT INCLUDES THE COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT HIGH SEISMIC SO NO CONSTITUENTS NO CONSTITUENTS OF YEARS WHATEVER PAIN ASSESSMENT. AND AND AND AND AND THAT THE THE MITIGATION DOLLARS WERE NOT FLOW INTO YOUR DISTRICT IN CENTRAL TO I SEISMIC AREAS YES SO. THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOUR PEOPLE ARE ASSESSED YOU'RE EXEMPT IN ESSENCE. A TWENTY ON THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WERE CALLED SEISMIC COUNTIES 83% OF THE STATE'S POPULATION LIVES IN THOSE COUNTIES. YOU ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THAT. BY MORE FLOOD INSURANCE. THERE MIGHT BE AN EXCEPTION OKAY THAT WAS MY OTHER QUESTION AND THEN -- LORI SO. STICK WITH IT. SO THIS IS IS THIS JUST WITH THIS FINE BE JUST LIMITED TO THOSE RESIDENTIAL STRUCTURES THAT. THAT YOU'VE DESCRIBED WHERE THERE'S A GARAGE CARPORT UNDERNEATH. THE HOME ITSELF. THE CURRENT PROGRAM CENTERED JUST APPLIES TO HOMES THAT ARE BUILT ON A CRAWL SPACE CRIPPLE ALL THE FOUR FEET OR LESS THAT'S BECAUSE THE FUNDS ARE SO LIMITED. WITH THIS PROGRAM WILL BE ABLE TO EXPAND TO A LIVING SPACE OVER GARAGE OR WHO IN HIM HOMES AND HILL SIDE WE ALSO WANT. TO MAKE THIS A BIT MAKE AVAILABLE THE PART THAT TO MULTI FAMILY APARTMENT BUILDINGS SO BYE BYE INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF FUNDING AVAILABLE BY FIFTEEN FULL. ON MOVIE OF THIS INCREASE THE NUMBER OF A DIFFERENT KIND OF STRUCTURES WOULD BE VILLARET TO FIT AGAIN FOR ALL NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE IN THE C. POLICY. THREE FORCE OF THE OF THE BRIDGE OF HIS WE PROVIDE OUR FOR POLICY HOLDERS OF THE FOLKS YOU SEE HERE OPPOSITION SO WE WANT TO RETROFIT THEIR HOMES -- AND AND AND WE WANTED RICH IF IT MORE OF THEIR HOMES WHICH THIS FUNDING WOULD ALLOW. IS IS THAT MONEY IS THAT MONEY ALLOWED TO BE USED FOR THE POLICY HOLDERS IN THE GROUP THAT YOU'RE. AND SHINNING. I'M STARTING TO GET FROM FEES NOW. IT IS BUT THAT WAS PART OF THE MANDATE OF SEE A TIME WHEN IT WAS CREATED BECAUSE I NEEDED TAX EXEMPT STATUS AND SO THEY HAD TO COME UP WITH SOME PUBLIC. PURPOSE WAS VERY SIMPLE PROGRAM AND THAT GIVES IT -- THE FACT THAT THAT MEANS THAT THE PREMIUMS COLLECTED OUR STATE AND FEDERAL TAX FREE. WHICH OF COURSE INCREASE KIND OF AN ADVANTAGE AS OPPOSED TO COMPANIES IN OUR GROUP THAT WRITE IT ON THEIR OWN PAPER THE-FACTS ARE CAPACITY AFFECTS OUR COSTS. AND THINGS LIKE THAT SO THE MONEY IS AVAILABLE -- FOR POLICY HOLDERS OF RESIDENTIAL PROPERTY OF LARGE ART BUT NOT AVAILABLE FOR ALL THE COMMERCIAL PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO BE -- ASSESSED AND THAT'S WERE YOU TRYING TO STRUGGLE TO FIND THE NEXUS FOR INSTANCE BETWEEN CHARITY. AND YOU KNOW INSURANCE AND ARCHERY BONDS FOR INSTANCE IN THIS PROGRAM ON THIS NUMBER OF OTHER EXAMPLES. SO I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT I UNDERSTAND THIS RIGHT SO -- THAT THE COMPANIES THAT YOU'RE REPRESENTING OUR OUR PAYING FOR THE INSURANCE. ALREADY AND TAKING THE RISK PRIVATELY SO PERHAPS I WRITE WITH YOUR COMPANY. ONE OF YOUR COMPANIES. I PAY FOR EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. YOU UNDER RIGHT MY RISK. CELL I'M COVERING MYSELF BECAUSE I PAPER EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. AND IT IS THE OBJECTION THEN BECAUSE NOW YOU'RE BEING ASKED. TO ASK ME TO PAN ASSESSMENT BECAUSE SENATOR ROSS DIDN'T GET AN EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. BECAUSE SENATOR ROTH HAS WILL HAVE A LOSS IN HE WAS A POLICY HOLDER OF A MEMBER COMPANY OF CA. BECAUSE SO ALL THIS. IS CONTINUED ASSESSMENT GOES TO THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH OF CA WHICH IS THERE FOR ONE PAUL PURPOSE AND ONE PURPOSE ONLY THAT IS TO PAY THE CLAIMS. OF THEIR MEMBER COMPANIES SO THE MILLION POLICY HOLDERS THAT THEY HAVE OUR POLICY HOLDERS OF THEIR TWENTY FOUR COMPANIES. ONLY AND YOU WOULD BE ASSESSING EIGHTY OTHER HOMEOWNERS COMPANIES AND TWO HUNDRED PLUS COMMERCIAL INSURANCE COMPANIES TO PAY THE BENEFITS. FOR THOSE POLICY HOLDERS IN THE CA NOW. I MEAN THAT'S THE LEGAL KIND OF THEORY WHAT'S BEING DONE HERE IS TO SAY THAT CONTAGION ASSESSMENT WHICH WILL NEVER. TAKE A FACT GIVES US THE ABILITY TO NOT BY AGE REINSURANCE OTHER YEAH BECAUSE THERE'S IF WE HAVE A CONTINGENT OF SAYS MATT THAN THAT. GOES IN THE PLACE OF REINSURANCE AND THEN THEY'LL TAKE THAT MONEY AND PUT IT INTO A BRACE INVOLVED. AS AS WE SAID BEFORE WE DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM WITH BASED RESEMBLED -- I THINK THERE IS -- ISSUE WHERE -- YOU CAN COMBINE RETROFIT -- FOR EARTHQUAKE AND COMBINE AND RETROFIT FOR WILDFIRE. AND THEN EVERYBODY. AND THE STATE WOULD HAVE SOME INTEREST AS OPPOSED TO BEING AN EARTHQUAKE AREA OR FIRE AREA OR WHATEVER THE CASE MAY BE. DISTRICT HAS THE YOU KNOW OF NO IT'S A BENEFIT -- THE ADVERSE DEAL BEING BOTH EARTHQUAKE AND FIRE. SO YEAH [inaudible] WHAT BUT? BUT BUT IF I BATRES QUAKE INSURANCE MONEY YOUR COMPANIES IS IT CONCEIVABLE THAT IF HE WAS MY NEIGHBOR AND HE SAID AND I DON'T WANT TO PAY FOR THE EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE. NO NO NO NO OKAY I WOULD QUE. THE THE SENATE OF THE ASSESSMENT. THE THE LIKELY ASSESSMENT THAT THAT COULD HAPPEN SOMEDAY BLESSING HALF A PERCENT PROBABILITY THAT EVER WILL BUT IT BIT THEM ON THAT WOULD BE MADE ON ON ALL THE LINES LISTED IN THE BILL -- TO ASSIST THE SEEING PAYING CLAIMS FOR ITS POLICYHOLDERS TO THE RIGHT IN SAYING SO OTHERS ARE BEING ASSESSED FOR THE C. CAN PAY CLAIMS FOR HIS POLICY HOLDERS. BUT THAT'S BECAUSE IN EXCHANGE WE'VE BEEN OUT THERE RETROFITTING THEIR HOMES -- EVERY YEAR UNTIL THAT VERY UNLIKELY EVENT OCCURS. AND IF YOU SEE THE POINT SO EVERY HOMEOWNER IN CALIFORNIA HIGH SEISMIC ZONE WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS THIS RETROFIT PROGRAM EVERYONE WHETHER THEY'RE SHARED BY US OR NOT. CURRENTLY THREE FOURTHS OF THE HOME TO RETROFIT. I DO NOT HAVE A SEAT POLICY THAT'S BECAUSE THIS PUBLIC ENTITY. ISN'T IN HERE TO MAKE A PROFIT AT IT WE'RE HERE TO MAKE CALIFORNIA A SAFER AND OUR EARTHQUAKE RISK REASONABLE PROGRAMS FOR EVERYONE. IT WOULD BE FOR EVERYONE TO IF WE COULD PUT MORE MONEY BEHIND SO WE COULD RICH FIT MORE OF THEIR INSURANCE HOMES IT AND THERE'S THERE'S NO WE DON'T ASK QUESTIONS. ABOUT DO YOU HAVE EARTHQUAKE POLICY. WHO IS THAT WITH THEM THAT IS IRRELEVANT IF PEOPLE ARE SELECTED FOR PROGRAM WHERE TO RETROFIT IT MAKE IT SAFER? THE TRADE OFF FOR THAT IS AN ASSESSMENT ON ABOUT TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS OF OTHER LINES OF INSURANCE. YES ME AND I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE IN THE SCENARIO THAT YOU OUTLINED WITH SENATOR ROTH BEING YOUR NEIGHBOR. IF SENATOR ROTH IS YOUR NEIGHBOR AND HE HAS A CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY POLICY AND YOU HAVE THIS SAY A GOLDEN BEAR HOMEOWNER'S POLICY DIDN'T CHOSE NOT TO PURCHASE EARTHQUAKE. YOU IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE WOULD BE PAYING AN ASSESSMENT ON YOUR HOMEOWNER'S POLICY TO PAY FOR SENATOR ROSS HOME TO BE REPAIRED UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY POLICY. BUT YOU ALSO WOULD BE ABLE TO GET YOUR HEAD HOUSE RETROFITTED FOR FREE. IF IT WAS ALRIGHT. I DON'T DISAGREE WITH THAT IT BUT REMEMBER I MEAN. IF IT HAPPENED TO BE UNDER -- OLDER THAN A HOME BUILT IN NINETEEN EIGHTY OF COURSE AS WELL AND AGAIN WE'RE NOT ANTI FREE SYMBOL AT ALL I MEAN 1100% BEHIND EXPLAINING THE PROGRAM AND WE WANT TO GET THESE HOMES RETROFITTED. IT IS PURELY THE NON PARTICIPATING INSURER ASSESSMENT THAT WE DO NOT SUPPORT LET'S FIND ANOTHER INNOVATIVE WAY TO GET FINANCING FOR THE PROGRAM SO THAT WE CAN GET THESE HOMES PROTECTED. WHAT IS THE COST OF RETROFITTING A SAY IT'S A HALF A MILLION DOLLAR HOME? THE CURRENT REGS VISIT WERE ABLE TO DO ARE JUST FOR HOMES THAT SIT ON TOP OF A CRAWL SPACE M. M. AT HALF A MILLION. THE BE ABOUT OF AT AMP AT A PRICE DIRECTOR IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COST BETWEEN THREE AND FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. IS MORE IS HIGHER IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE THE BAY AREA BECAUSE OF HIGHER COST OF LABOR MATERIALS COST BUT FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND BUCKS. SO OUR GRANTS PROVIDE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS REIMBURSEMENT TO PEOPLE ARE SELECTED AT IN COULD BE THE PROGRAM SO IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE ABLE TO COVER KIND OF MOST OF THE COST OF THE RETROFIT. IN NORTHERN CALIFORNIA IT GOES A LONG WAY TO A SITTING THE FIVE OR SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THAT A PERSON ENTERS. SO IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM STARTED TWENTY FOURTEEN WE KNOW RIP RETROFITTED SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED HOMES -- ALMOST ALL OF THREE FOURTHS OF THEM. AT ALL OUR HOMES THAT ARE NOT CA INSURED -- IN AND WE HAVE MADE A DIFFERENCE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH IS PROGRAM BEEN OPERATING NOW FOR SEVERAL YEARS WE'VE MADE THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS MORE RESILIENT. WHICH WANT TO EXTEND THAT TO IT TOO IS THAT THE ALL OF THE HIGH SEISMIC AREAS IN THE STATE. I SENATOR DOES THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION [inaudible] SENATOR GLAZER. THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR INTERIM HEARING. THIS IS A GREAT CONVERSATION TO HAVE BECAUSE THERE'S A LOT OF QUESTIONS. BUT BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU THIS COMES AT A TIME WHERE I'M TRIPLE BOOKED AT THIS MOMENT IN TIME. IN TERMS OF BEING HERE HAVING TO BE OTHER PLACES. I JUST -- I'VE READ THIS MATERIAL I APPRECIATE YOUR STAFF COMING OVER INSURE IT WITH ME. BUT IS VERY COMPLEX AND IT'S CHALLENGING TO GET MY HEAD AROUND IT AND YOU'VE DONE A GOOD JOB OF TRYING TO EXPLAIN IT TO ME AND I I KNOW THE INTENTIONS ARE GOOD BUT I JUST WANT TO TELL YOU THAT. BUT THIS DOES COME AT A TIME WHERE WE'VE HAD REALLY A MATTER OF DAYS TO TRY TO STUDY SOMETHING VERY COMPLEX AND VERY SERIOUS. NOW I I GIVE YOU ENORMOUS PROPS FOR IDENTIFYING A PROBLEM -- BUT IS NOT ONE NECESSARILY THAT CAN BE SOLVED BY WHAT YOU PUT ON THE TABLE BUT YOU HAVE IDENTIFIED A PROBLEM YOU'VE IDENTIFIED. THE LOSS OF PREMIUMS THAT WE PAID OUT OVER TWENTY YEARS FIVE BILLION DOLLARS. AND WHAT DO WE GET OUT OF THAT YOU KNOW A QUARTER OF A MILLION DOLLARS OR WHATEVER IT THE PAY I I GET WHY IN HINDSIGHT. YOU LOOK AT THAT CIRCUMSTANCE AND YOU SAY HEY THAT WASN'T REALLY A GOOD DEAL WE COULD USE THAT MONEY AND YOU'RE RIGHT. BUT WE WE CAN'T MAKE POLICIES IT'S LIKE YOU KNOW I SHOULD HAVE INVESTED IN THAT STOCK OKAY. AND SO I APPRECIATE WHY IT'S FRUSTRATING TO TO SEE ALL OF OUR PREMIUMS ON THE EARTHQUAKES GOING TO RE INSURANCE. RIGHT. WE'VE COVERED THAT OBLIGATION BUT WE GOT NOTHING REALLY OUT OF IT THAT WE CAN CONTINUE ON I I SHARE THAT FRUSTRATION IT IS. IT IS WORRISOME BUT AT AT AT THE FUNDAMENTAL TO THAT CIRCUMSTANCES OUR WILLINGNESS TO TAKE RISKS. RIGHT AND YOU HAVE A PROPOSAL ON HOW YOU WANT TO MANAGE THE RISK BUT THAT'S AT THE FUNDAMENTAL ELEMENTS OF THESE CHOICES THAT WE MAKE. I ON IN THIS IN THIS SPACE OKAY -- THE I THINK THE BRAZEN BALL WHICH OF COURSE IS AN INCREDIBLY WORTHY PROGRAM. FOR ME AT LEAST IS AN ENORMOUS DISTRACTION. I SUPPORT BRACE SIMPLE AND EFFECTIVE IT'S A PRIORITY OF THE STATE TO BRACE INVOLVED IN WHAT'S TAKE A HUNDRED MILLION OUT OF THE GENERAL FUND ONE TIME AND GET IT ALL DONE RIGHT -- BUT I I'VE I'VE SEEN IN MY LEGISLATIVE CAREER AND BEYOND. HI. WHATEVER WHATEVER IT IS OKAY WHATEVER IT IS BUT I HAVE SEEN IN MY TIME IN THIS SPACE. VERY OFTEN THE IN THESE CARROTS LIKE AT LET'S SAID HAVE A LOTTERY BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS NGUYEN. TO RIGHT OR LET'S SAY CHANGER PENSION PLAN NOW BECAUSE IT'S NOT GOING TO COST US ANYTHING I I'VE SEEN THESE THINGS AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT. THAT THIS IS IT BUT I'M SAYING THAT WHEN YOU PUT OUT. SOMETHING THE SO ATTRACTIVE IT DISTRACTS FROM WHAT THE THE REALLY THE EQUATION THAT TO BEFORE US TODAY. AND FOR ME AT LEAST. IT'S NOT ABOUT BRACING BOLD AND PUTTING MONEY INTO BRACE SYMBOL OKAY -- IT'S LIKE WE WERE TALKING ABOUT SICK REFORM THE OTHER DAY AND WAS LIKE WELL THE JUDGES SAY WE AT IT'S GOING TO CLOG UP THE COURTS WILL IF IT'S ABOUT HOUSING AND SEEK REFORM HELPS. WELL THAT'S UNCLOG THE COURTS SO THERE'S A LOT OF DISTRACTIONS THAT COME INTO OUR POLICY DISCUSSIONS AND FOR ME AT LEAST. I'D SAY GRAYSON BOLT SHOULDN'T BE AT IT'S REALLY ABOUT HOW WE MANAGE RISK AND AND MANAGE RISK IS NOT NECESSARILY -- ABOUT MODERNIZING. I IT'S NOT ABOUT. TAKING LESS CASH OUT OF THE BUDGET -- BUT BUT IT'S REALLY THERE'S LOTS OF CHOICES IN THAT SPACE THERE REALLY IS AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE CHOICES WERE YOU SAY ALL IN CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THIS -- BACK TAX OR WHAT HOW WE WANT TO CHARACTERIZE IT AND THAT'S HOW WE'RE GONNA MAKE UP -- AT BEING ABLE TO SKIM OFF THE MONEY. THAT WE CAN USE FOR A GOOD PURPOSE WHATEVER ITS BRACE INVOLVED OR WHATEVER IT IS. AND I THINK THAT THAT'S A GREAT CONVERSATION TO HAVE I I THINK IT'S EXCELLENT AND I AND I THINK THERE'S A LOT OF THERE'S A LOT OF OPTIONS IN THAT SPACE REALLY. THIS COULD BE A GREAT. ONE THIS DID THIS FOR ME AT LEAST THIS IS JUST THIS IS AN OPTION. AND IS A LOT OF WAYS TO DECIDE HOW WE WANT TO MANAGE THAT RISK AND MAKE THOSE CHOICES. IN THAT SPACE AND IT'S A WERE THE WERE THE WERE THE CONVERSATION BUT I DO FEEL -- THE I. UNDER PRESSURE. TO MAKE A CHOICE TODAY ABOUT SOMETHING THAT I AGREE WITH YOU IS AN ISSUE. IN THE CONTEXT OF A LOT OF THINGS INCLUDING HOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE MANAGE FIRE RISK IN OUR STATE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF US. RIGHT NOW IN FACT A MATTER OF WEEKS OR SO TO SOLVE THAT PROBLEM HOW WE GONNA MANAGE VIRUS. SO I THINK THIS IS A VERY WORTHY CONVERSATION AND I SO ADMIRE YOUR LEADERSHIP IN IN STIMULATING AND AND AND BUT I DO FEEL THAT THIS PRESSURE OF A CHOICE TODAYIS A WORRISOME ONE FOR ME. THAT'S MY HONEST FEEDBACK ABOUT CAN I JUST MANAGER WENT JUST QUICKLY RESPOND ALL PLUGGED INTO MY CLOTHES -- IS THIS. I I UNDERSTAND INSENSITIVE TO YOUR ISSUES VERY MUCH BUT WHAT I WOULD SUGGEST IN THIS DYNAMIC IS THIS IS SOMETHING THAT I INVENTED YESTERDAY. THERE'S OR CALIFORNIA EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITY THERE'S A TWENTY FIVE YEAR TRACK RECORD. THE AUTHORITY IS CONTROLLED BY THE GOVERNOR OF THE STATE TREASURER IN A FIFTEEN HUNDRED STAFF INSURANCE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE. THEREFORE THE PROFESSIONALS OF THIS IS THEIR ANALYSIS THEIR JOB THEIR HOMEWORK. NOTHING IS HAPPENING HERE WHAT WE'RE DOING SOMETHING WE WERE INVENTING SOMETHING BRAND NEW OR CHANGING THE LAW THERE'S NEVER BEEN TESTED OR STUDIED. THEY SPENT YEARS WORKING ON THIS THING AND AND THEIR PROFESSIONAL OPERATION THEY'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE ANY RISK. TO ADVERSELY AFFECT THE INSURANCE POLICY HOLDERS OR ANYBODY ELSE YOU'VE GOT UNBELIEVABLE FRAZIER APPLICATIONBY THE WAY IT WAS APRIL FIRST LET'S TWELFTH AT THIS AMENDMENTS CAME IN BUT IN ANY EVENT THE DISCUSSIONS HAVE BEEN GOING ON WITH THEM AND EVERYBODY ELSE'S EVERYBODY BEHIND IT KNOWS ABOUT THIS FOR A LONG. TIME AND SO I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THAT YOU'RE CORRECT ALWAYS TO BE IS A LAST MINUTE YOU'RE CORRECT ALWAYS I GUESS THE STORY THAT FEELING RUSHED ALL I'M TELLING YOU IS THERE'S A VERY STRONG FRAMEWORK WITH THE GOVERNOR. INSURANCE COMMISSIONER AND THE TREASURER ALL OF WHOM HAVE A GIGANTIC STAFF THAT WORK THROUGH THIS IN GREAT DETAIL AND BELIEVE ME IF YOU'RE RISK AVERSE THEY ARE TRIPLE RISK AVERSE BECAUSE THAT'S THEIR NATURE. AND SO THAT'S THE BOTTOM LINE I THINK IN TERMS OF WHAT THE DISTINCTION IS WITH RESPECT TO THIS IDEA I WOULD NOT HAVE BROUGHT SOME BRAND NEW COCKAMAMIE IDEA. THAT HAD NOT HAD THE FRAMEWORK TO MAKE IT HAPPEN IT BECAUSE THEY'VE THEY'VE REALLY SCRUB THIS AND THEY CAN GIVE YOU THE DETAILS ON HOW THE SCRUB. AND AND IF AYE BABE BUT I'M SURE IT RESPONSE SIX THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT AND I I DON'T WANT IN ANY WAY TO BE PEACE MERGE THE THE PROFESSIONALISM AND CAPABILITY. OF OUR OUR FRIENDS AT THE EARTHQUAKE STORY OKAY AND THE AND THE COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE OR A OR YOU AS THE AUTHOR -- NOT NOT NOT A SMIDGEN OKAY -- BUT THEY ALSO LOOK AT THINGS -- IN A FRAME THAT'S DIFFERENT THAN OUR FRIEND. IF IF PEOPLE HAVE TO PAY. BECAUSE OF CATASTROPHIC OF THE EVENTS THAT WE HOPE WILL NEVER HAPPEN. THEY'RE GONNA COME TO US IN TERMS OF THE CHOICES THAT WE MAY. OKAY THAT WE MADE I THINK THAT WE WOULD BE THAT WOULD BENEFIT GREATLY. IF WE HAD THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S REVIEWING THIS PROPOSAL OR OTHER OTHER INDEPENDENT -- PROFESSIONALS THAT HAVE EXPERTISE WE WOULD BE ADVANTAGE THESE ARE VERY SERIOUS CHOICES THAT YOU'RE ASKING US TO MAKE TODAY. TODAY OKAY AND THAT'S WHAT -- GIVES ME PAUSE. I HAVE GREAT RESPECT FOR THE CREATIVITY AND THE PROFESSIONALISM AND EXPERTISE THAT YOU BRING. THANK YOU I'M SENATOR ARCHULETA. THANK YOU SENATOR FOR APPEAR BEFORE US AND I THINK IT'S A IT'S A GREAT TO STEP IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. HOWEVER I AM I DO HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ONE WE CAN CALL IT WHATEVER WE WANT TO CALL IT BUT I I I KEEP HEARING THE WORD TAX. IN IN ITS ITS CALLED ELEVEN A IT'S CALLED AN ASSESSMENT -- I KEEP HEARING THE WORD TAX IT JUST KEEPS COMING THROUGH THE SCREEN. THE WORD TAX IN RIGHT NOW WE'RE ABOUT TO FACE OF FINANCIAL. OBLIGATION PERTAINING TO THE FIRES AND AND THAT SORT OF THING AND SO I'M. CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT THAT IS AROUND THE CORNER WERE OBVIOUSLY THIS IS. GOD WILLING GET OFF DECADES AHEAD FOR LIFE TIMES AHEAD. BUT IT YOU ENTERED ONE OF THE FIRST QUESTIONS AFTER THAT THE BRACE AND BOLTS IS THAT STAY AND PLAY OR DOES THAT. IS IT DOES IT. IF WE DO NOT GO FORWARD WITH THIS IS THAT WASHED OUT OR ITS STATE OF MATTER WHAT. THE BASEBALL PROGRAM WILL REMAIN WILL WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO READ FOR THE COUPLE THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR. BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT WITH THE CURRENT FUNDING AVAILABLE OKAY THAT'S THAT'S ONE THING THE OTHER THING IS. FROM WHAT I UNDERSTAND. IF SOMEONE OWNS. HYPOTHETICALLY SEVERAL PIECES OF PROPERTY. THE ASSESSMENT -- LET BABY WILL BE ON EACH. ONE AND EACH POLICY -- FOR TEN YEARS POSSIBLY POSSIBLY -- DOES THAT ALSO GO IN THE AUTOMOBILES AND OTHER. IF YOU HAD A HUNDRED HOUSES YOU'RE GONNA PAY INSURANCE ON OUR HOUSES IDEA THAT'S BEING MADE BY THE OPPOSITION SO YOU GOT A BUNCH OF A SENSE OF COURSE IT IS. IF YOU BUY INSURANCEON CARS. I JUST HIT MY QUESTION WAS ARE YOUR PRIMARY RESIDENCE TO SINGLE OUT COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. IT'S IT'S ACROSS THE BOARD THAT'S MY QUESTION OF COURSE OKAY CROSS THE BORDER AS IT IS AND EVERYTHING ELSE YES ALL RIGHT WELCOME TO CAPITALISM. AND IN I UNDERSTAND IT. ONCE IT STARTS IT'S IT'S IT IT'LL BE A TEN YEAR PROGRAM CORRECT. THOSE ARE CHEN YOUR PROGRAM IT'S A NO YEAR PROGRAM WHAT THE IDEA IS THIS THIS IS WHAT'S BEING CONFUSED HERE OKAY. IF THERE'S AN EARTHQUAKE THE SIZE OF SAN FRANCISCO NOBODY PAYS A DYING PERIOD NEXT CASE ZERO ZIP NOTHING. THIS IS A THIS IS A LEGAL FICTION IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THE RATING AND GET SAVINGS SO YOU GET TO THAT CHART THAT WE SHOWED YOU AT THE TOP OF THE CHART WHEN THERE'S OF THE FIFTEEN BILLION. YOU AT THE TOP HYPOTHETICALLY IF THERE'S FIFTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN LOSS WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN TO SOCIETY THE PLACE IS GOING TO BE HOME THERE'S GOING TO BE PEOPLE THAT HOMES THAT BUSINESSES ARE GONNA SHUT DOWN. AS YOU THE ALL SORTS OF DYNAMICS THAT ARE GOING TO OCCUR WE'RE TRYING TO BE RESPONSIBLE IN THINKING THIS THROUGH THROUGH AN ADVANCE AT IN THAT EVENT. THERE WILL BE AN ASSESSMENT ON INSURANCE POLICIES ONLY AFTER. ALL DOLLARS OR OTHERWISE EXPUNGE THERE'S NO DOLLARS LEFT EVERYTHING IS GONE. AND THEN THERE'S A THE REASON WHY WE CAPITA TEN YEARS OF AT A CERTAIN LIMóN POLICY ALONG THESE POLICIES IS TO GIVE PEOPLE A COMFORT LEVEL THAT IT'S NOT GOING ON FOREVER. IN THE EVENT THAT HAPPENS NOW% QUITE FRANKLY JUST LIKE WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH THE WILD FIRES PEOPLE ARE SAYING ALL THIS IS GREAT LIABILITY THE TRUTH OF THE MATTER IS YOU DON'T PAY ALL THE MONEY OUT ON DAY. ONE THESE EARTHQUAKE AUTHORITIES AS YOU PAY IN PREMIUMS WILL CONTINUE TO GET RE GENERATED SO I WOULD SUGGEST REAL QUITE FRANKLY THAT THE THAT THE ODDS ARE EVEN LESS. BECAUSE YOU DON'T PAY ALL DOLLARS ON DAY ONE IT'S NOT LIKE A DEATH BENEFIT SOMEBODY PASSES AWAY HERE'S A CHECK. YOU'RE PAYING FOR CONSTRUCTION AS YOU GO AND YOU REPLENISHING YOUR POT AS YOU GO SO I MEAN. IT IT IS A WAY TO TRY TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE WE KEEP OUR RATINGS. AND BE ABLE TO BE CREATIVE TO PROVIDE THIS PROGRAM ACROSS THE BOARD TO SO MANY MORE PEOPLE BECAUSE IF THERE IS AN EARTHQUAKE WE CAN TALK ABOUT RISK ALL DAY LONG. BUT OUR JOB IS TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC AND HERE'S A WAY THAT DOESN'T COST ANYBODY A DIME. I TO DIE IN THAT WILL HAVE THE IMMEDIATE IMPACT TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC ON A HYPOTHETICAL RISK. AT THE BACK AND AFTER FIFTEEN BILLIONS PAID AND I WOULD ARGUE THESE EVEN WORSE THAN THAT AND WHAT HAPPENS IS THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY IS COMFORTABLE OF COURSE IN THEIR DEAL SINCE WHAT THE PICTURES COMMISSIONER SAID WHICH IS WE'VE GOT TO BE CREATIVE. AS WE FACE THESE RISKS THAT'S SIMPLE. IN AND FINISH UP WITH THE OPPOSITION IS THERE -- MAN AMENDMENT THAT YOU CAN WORK OUT THEY'LL BRING YOU CLOSER TOGETHER OUR USUAL FAR APART I DON'T THINK WE ARE WITH A VERY GOOD MEETING YESTERDAY AND I LOOKED AT WE TALKED A LOT OF ISSUES AND I THINK THERE'S A REAL POSSIBILITY TO TRY TO MAKE IT WORK MY VIEW. IS THIS MY VIEW IS WE ALWAYS DO AND I CERTAINLY OF BEEN THE BOTH THE PROPONENT OPPONENT BOTH SIDES I DON'T BEGRUDGE YOU. I WANT TO GET IT PASSED THIS COMMITTEE I WANT TO CONTINUE THE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THESE GUYS I WANT TO DEAL WITH THE ISSUE ABOUT TAX I SAID TO YOU PERIOD POINT BLANK DIRECT I AM NOT INTERESTED. IN BEING SOMEONE WHO'S PUTTING A TAX BILL ON THE SENATE FLOOR I BELIEVE THAT THE OPINION THAT THEY'RE DOING IN THE AT THE ANALYSIS WAS A COMPLETE AS FOR STATE YOU I DISINGENUOUS.ABOUT UNDERSTAND IT WAS BEING RE WRITTEN ABOUT HOW IT CHARACTERIZES THAT I'M TALKING TO LEDGE COUNCIL IN AN EFFORT TO TRY. TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SOLVE THAT I'M TRYING TO DO WHAT'S CALLED A VALIDATION ACTION MEETING THAT THIS IS NOT A TAX NOBODY'S VOTING ON THIS THE TAX COURT HAS TO MAKE A DETERMINATION FIRST BEFORE THIS GOES INTO LAW. BECAUSE THERE'S THINK ABOUT WHAT A TAXES I MEAN THINK ABOUT THAT AND SO I AM SENSITIVE TO AND I'M COMMITTING TO YOU THAT I'M NOT PUTTING A TAX ON THE FLOOR. BUT I WANNA I DO BELIEVE WE HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION TO A NUMBER OF ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DISCUSSED TODAY THAT I THINK WILL HELP SOLVE THE PROBLEM. AND TO ARE A YOU KNOW I'VE GOT TO GET PAST THE TAX ISSUE IN THE MEANTIME I'M TRYING TO COLLEGE TRY TO MAKE THIS EFFORT WORK AND YOU KNOW THAT IT AND I THINK IT'S IT BEARS A LOT OF VALUE BECAUSE YOU GET IMMEDIATE BENEFIT YOU PUT A LOT. OF PEOPLE TO WORK YOUR STICKS IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S HOMES AND YOUR MITIGATING A VERY SIGNIFICANT RISK AND THAT'S A GOOD THING FOR US TO DO IT I'D MAKE THAT MY CLOTHES [inaudible] I GET. I THINK I HAVE THIS DOWN SO. WE GIVE THE AUTHORITY TO THE CA TO PUT AN ASSESSMENT. ON A WHOLE VARIETY OF POLICIES. AND ACTUALLY HAVE THE CONSUMERS PAY. IF CERTAIN CONTINGENCIES OCCUR. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE A ABOUT A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN SAVINGS ON YOUR RE INSURANCE POLICY PREMIUMS. USE ON THIS BRACE INVOLVED PRO. BY THE WAY. THE CONTENTION ASSESSMENT FOR THE ASSESSMENT ON CONTINGENCY. APPLIES TO SUCH THINGS AS THE POLICY THAT I HAVE ON MY BEECH BONANZA OF NINETEEN SIXTY FOUR AIRPLANES SO I WOULD BE PAYING AN ASSESSMENT. SO SHOULD WITH MY AVIATION POLICY. IN ORDER TO COVER SOME EARTHQUAKE ISSUE. SEEMS A LITTLE INCONSISTENT AT THAT POINT. BUT BE THAT AS IT MAY. I GUESS MY QUESTION IS IS BRACING VULTURE CORE MISSION IS THE CA. MHM ETCETERA FOCUSING ON BRACING BOLT AND I THOUGHT I AM A POLICY HOLDER BY THE WAY. AND I THOUGHT SEE A WAS AN EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE COMPANY. WE ARE ABSOLUTE OF QUAKE INSURANCE WE'D RICHER MORE THAN MILLION HOMES WE DO HAVE THIS LEGISLATIVE MANDATE. THAT WE PROMOTE MITIGATION AS WELL SO THIS IS. THIS IS REALLY A MATTER OF ALLOWING US TO AND SHE'S A REINSURANCE SAVING SO WE CAN BETTER FIT MORE HOMES BUT I MEAN IT'S WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A SOCIAL POLICY HERE NOT. AN INSURANCE COVERAGE YOU YOUR YOUR GROUP OF FILLING A SOCIAL -- POLICY OBLIGATION THAT SOMEBODY PUT ON YOU IS SEE A TO RETROFIT HOMES THAT HAVE NOTHING TO DO IS SEE A POLICY HOLDERS RIGHT -- WE ARE THE ANY WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IN THIS ISSUE THAT -- IT WE WE WILL ALWAYS HAVE THE LEGISLATIVE MANDATE TO WORK TOWARDS MITIGATION AND THE WAY THAT WORKS IS. THAT THE LET THAT SUCH AS THAT CREATED US. MANDATES THAT 5% OF OUR INVESTMENT INCOME GO INTO IT LOST ME THE GOING TO FIND MANY FUNDING MITIGATION. AS WE DEVELOP THIS PROGRAM AND WE'RE DOING TWO THOUSAND HOMES BUT THERE'S OVER THE AT IS OVER FIVE MILLION HOMES THAT NEED TO BE RETROFITTED SAID GETTING MORE THAN YOUR OWN LAW SHE MANY RIGHT EVERYBODY ELSE THAT'S RIGHT. INSURED IN THE UNINSURED WAS RIGHT. SO I'M I MEAN I WATCHED WANTED -- THIS GOOD IT'S A NOBLE EFFORT. SO THEN THAT LEADS TO MY NEXT QUESTION AND I'M TRYING TO ANALYZE WHY ARE WE DOING THIS NOW. IF IT'S A HUNDRED YEAR VENTURA FOUR HUNDRED YEAR VENTURA FIFTY YEAR EVENT. WHEN WE TAKE A LOOK AT IT? IF AND WHEN SOMETHING HAPPENS AND DECIDE WHO NEEDS TO BE ASSESSED AND WHETHER THE GENERAL FUND CAN COVER THE LOSS OR WHY ARE WE ARE WE VOTING ON THIS NOW. BECAUSE SIDE TO SAY WE SHOULDN'T WAIT IS A NINETY NINE POINT 7% PROBABILITY OF A SIX POINT SEVEN EARTHQUAKE THAT SIZE IN NORTHRIDGE. HAPPENING AGAIN SOMETIME THE NEXT THIRTY YEARS THEY THEY DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHEN AND WHERE. QUESTION I APOLOGIZE NO DISRESPECT BUT I THINK THE ANSWER THE QUESTION AS THE RATING AGENCIES JUST LIKE WERE FACING WITH INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES BANKRUPTCIES ARE SAYING. IN ORDER TO GIVE THE TRIPLE A RATING THAT'S REQUIRED. WE NEED. ONE IN FOUR HUNDRED YEAR OF AND COVERAGE OKAY THAT'S SEVENTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS WE MEET THAT COVERAGE BY. THE HUGE SWATH OF REINSURANCE. IF IT FROM A LEGAL PERSPECTIVE IF WE COULD CREATE THIS CONTINGENT LIABILITY ON THE STACK WE ARE TOLD BY THE RATING AGENCIES THAT THEY WILL MAINTAIN OUR RATING. FOR THAT BORROWING AND THE AND THE WORK OF THE AT THE ITS CRICKET OR YOU CAN BE MAINTAINED AS TRIPLE A WITHOUT HAVING TO WRITE A CHECK. FOR THE RE INSURANCE LOWER IN THE STACK THAT SAVES A HUNDRED MILLION SO THAT THE RATING AGENCIES WILL LEGALLY RELY. ON THE CONTINGENCY LIABILITY AS AN ABILITY TO MAINTAIN THE TRIPLE A RATING THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO WELL AS IF I WERE AN AIRPLANE OWNER THAT LIVED IN. FRESNO FOR EXAMPLE IF THAT'S NOT AN EARTHQUAKE ZONE I DON'T KNOW. I MIGHT SAY WELL WHY ARE YOU GOING TO CAN ASSESS ME ON CONTINGENCY WHY DON'T YOU DO A COUPLE THINGS WANTED TO RAISE THE PREMIUM ON THE C. E. A POLICY HOLDERS TO BUILD A SURPLUS. I'M SORRY THE THE OF I DON'T THINK FRESNO WAS IN HIGH SEISMIC AREA I'M ENTIRELY SURE ABOUT. SEVEN NEW SO THERE WOULD BE NO ASSESSMENT. ALL ON MY AIRPLANE OKAY CAM IS ONLY ASSESSMENTS IN HIGH RISK ZONES. THAT'S RIGHT AND THAT'S A WE CAN PERFORM MUCH OF HIS MEETING IF I COULD JUST GET BACK TO THE QUESTION YES. IN TERMS TO CLARIFY OKAY MY QUESTION HAD TO DO WITH WHY ARE WE DOING IT NOW. AND IF THE EVENT OCCURS IN TWENTY FIVE YEARS OR THE EVENT OCCURS IN FIFTY YEARS THE CALIFORNIA BUDGET INSTEAD OF BEING TWO HUNDRED BILLION MIGHT BE SIX HUNDRED BILLION. BECAUSE CENTER THAT IS TOO LATE AND WENT OVER WHO IN UNTIL AFTER THE EARTHQUAKE OCCURS IN HOUSES TUMBLE OFF THEIR FOUNDATION BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T RETROFITTED. WE WOULD HAVE MISSED AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A HOME SAFER THAT'S MY POINT THE DRIVER HERE. IS NOT ANYTHING ELSE ANYTHING OTHER THAN THE BRAZEN. BALL PROGRAM AND IF THAT'S THE DRIVER THAN LETTER WE FIND A HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS SOME PLACE ELSE AS OPPOSED TO PUTTING A CONTINGENT IS. ON AIRPLANE OWNERS AND AND PEOPLE WHO OWN UP CONDOS IN HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATIONS WHERE THEY'RE GOING TO PAY THE ASSESSMENT ON THEIR ON THEIR THEIR HOME AT THEIR CONDO. POLICY AND THEN PAY THE ASSESSMENT THAT THE HOMEOWNERS ASSOCIATION PASSES ON TO THEM IN THE HOMEOWNERS FEE. SEE WHAT I'M SAYING. YES YEAH THE REASONS AS CENTER IF I COULD REAL QUICKLY. AG IS WE WANT TO DO SO THE REASON IS IS THAT BECAUSE THIS GETS A HUNDRED MILLION A YEAR. AND THAT IF IN THE EVENT IS IN TWENTY YEARS WE WILL NOW HAVE BOLTED TWO BILLION DOLLARS WORTH OF AND MAY BE ALMOST ALL THE HOMES OF THE TO BE BOLTED IN CALIFORNIA. TO THE RISK AT THE TIME OF THE EVENT WILL BE DRAMATICALLY LESS AND WE WILL HAVE MITIGATED THAT. AND IT'S NOT A ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR COST REYES AND BOLD IT'S BILLIONS. AND SO HUNDRED MILLION THE YEAR OR A SAVINGS EVERY YEAR AND THE THE IDEA IS THAT WERE BASICALLY SAVING IT BY REDUCING THE COST OF THE THE THE PREMIUMS TO THE REINSURANCE COMPANIES ON THE ONE HAND. AND ON A MORE MARING THAT IMMEDIATE PROTECTION AND IMMEDIATE MITIGATION AGAINST THE VERY HIGHLY UNLIKELY. THEORETICAL FOUGHT THAT YOUR AIRPLANE MIGHT GET TAXED IF YOU LIVE IN A MIGHT GET SET THE FEE ON IT. IF YOU LIVE IN A HIGH ZONE A HIGH A HIGH EARTHQUAKE ZONE YOU UNDERSTAND THE OPTIC FOR US THE OPTIC IS WE'RE IF PEOPLE DON'T UNDERSTAND THAT THERE'S A OF THE ASSESSMENT IS ON IS ON A CONVENTION [inaudible] THE CONTINGENCY. WE'RE GOING TO VOTE ON SOMETHING AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT A FEE ON SOME BORDER WHATEVER YOU CALL IT. YOUR ASSESSMENT ON SOMEBODY'S ACTIVITY OR PROPERTY. IT HAS NO NEXUS. TO ALTON BRACE FOR EARTHQUAKES OR ANYTHING ELSE BUT THAT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO SEE THE ASSESSMENT AND THEN THEY'RE GONNA HAVE A BILL INCREASE BILL NOT GONNA HAPPEN WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS AFTER FIFTEEN BILLION PLUS AT AND AGAIN IF IT HAPPENS IN TWENTY YEARS AT NUMBERS. PROBABLY GONNA BE. THIRTY BILLION THAT COVERS BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO CONTINUE TO GROW AND KNOWN SOME LIKE IT IS THE WAS GETTING A BILL. IT'S A PROPERTY TAX BILL NO ONE'S GETTING OF THE SALES TAX BILL THOSE GETTING A BILL. IT'S JUST A WAY TO BE ABLE TO MEET THE OBLIGATION AND THE BE SMART LOOK. HE E. I LIKED IT BECAUSE IT'S PUT A BUNCH OF MONEY IN THE IT IN IN REYES AND BOLD AND REDUCE RISK TO THE STATE. EVERY TIME RUN AROUND SPEND BILLIONS AND BILLIONS AFTER THE FACT FICTION FIRES FIX IN THIS PAY IN TEN X.. IF WE CAN FOR SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY DRAMATICALLY REDUCE IT ON A THEORETIC ON A SMALL RISK FOR AN IMMEDIATE BENEFIT. IT'S IT CAME OUT TO ME THAT IT'S A PRETTY GOOD PUBLIC POLICY AND MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT MAYBE SOMEONE CAN SPEND IT IN THE INDUSTRY TO SAY ALL THIS IS HAPPENING. BUT THIS IS A MOMENTARY THING THAT NO ONE'S GONNA SEE ANYTHING YEARS OF THE I CAN SEE A BILL ON YOUR A YOUR AIRPLANE. ONE OF THE YEAH ONE OF THE BASIC QUESTION AND I'M GOING. TO SHUT MY MOUTH. GRAYSON BOLD HOW WHAT ARE THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR PARTICIPATION IN FINANCIALLY NEED BASED IS IT. NOT BASED ON FINANCIALLY SO FAR THE PROGRAM WHICH WAS JUST STARTED TWENTY FOURTEEN BASICALLY -- DETERMINES ACT -- THAT ZIP CODES THAT WERE ABLE OPERATING CURRENTLY BE SENT TO CRITERIA. ZIP CODES THAT HAVE THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF A SEISMIC RISK. AND THAT NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO THAT THE HIGHEST CONCENTRATION OF OF OLD -- OLDER BUILDING STOCK IN IS IN A ZIP CODE -- IN YEARS IN YOUR DID. IN YOUR ZIP CODE IN YOUR IN YOUR SENATE DISTRICT THERE'S OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES THAT WERE BUILT PRIOR TO NINETEEN EIGHTY THEY'RE PROBABLY VULNERABLE AND NEED TO GET RETROFITTED. NO ONE ELSE IS COMING FORWARD WITH A PROACTIVE PROGRAM TO SAY LET'S LET'S TAKES A LITTLE PORTION THE MONEY THAT WE'RE CURRENTLY SENDING TO BERMUDA IN LONDON. AND IN SWITZERLAND AND GERMANY TO THE REINSURERS AROUND THE WORLD STICK A PORTION THAT MONEY IN SENATOR RIVERSIDE SO WE CAN MAKE A HOMES THEY'RE SAFER -- SO THAT WHEN THE EARTHQUAKE DOES STRIKE THEY'RE GONNA BE LESS HOMES A COUPLE OF THE FOUNDATION THAT THAT'S REALLY WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT MANNER CHECK JUST FOR A SECOND I'M SO SORRY HAD TO GO PRESENT A BILL RIGHT NOW I'M GOING TO HAND. OVER THE GAVEL -- TO MISTER JONES AND I WILL BE RIGHT BACK THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH. CENTER I THINK YOU SAW THE FOR OKAY THANK YOU. OUR THERE MORE LOCK AND THEN WE'LL GO TO A CINDER DOT. THANK YOU MSTER CHAIR -- TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO THIS TIME. THERE WAS A ELECTED OFFICIAL ORANGE COUNTY WHO. CAME UP WITH THE RATHER CREATIVE FINANCING SCHEME. AND HE WAS ABLE TO DOUBLE. TRIPLE THE AMOUNT OF YIELD THAT HE WAS GETTING OUT OF HAND AS FROM. THE TAXPAYERS. AND HE WAS VERY CLEAR ABOUT HOW HE WAS DOING AND HE WAS BARRING TO INVEST IN. THEY SAID WELL IF INTEREST RATES GO UP THEN YOU MIGHT HAVE MARGIN CALLS AND HE WAS SAID NAH NEVER HAPPEN. AND IF IT DOES HAPPEN. I'VE GOT PLENTY OF CASH. THE PAPER MARGIN CALLS. HE WAS RUNNING HAS SCHEME THAT BY DECEMBER OF NINETY FOUR BLEW UP IN THE COUNTY OF ORANGE LAST ONE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS. I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT STORY BECAUSE WE HAVE AN INSURANCE COMPANY. THE IDEA WITH EARTH QUAKES. AN INSURANCE COMPANY HAS TO BUY REINSURANCE ALL INSURANCE COMPANIES DO WELCOME TO THE WELCOME TO THE BUSINESS. YES IF YOU DON'T USE IT YOU LOSE IT THAT BUT THAT'S THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS AND THAT'S HOW YOU. COMPUTE YOUR PREMIUMS THAT YOU CHARGE ALL THE PEOPLE THAT WANT% TO HAVE EARTHQUAKE PROTECTION OR ANY OTHER KIND OF PROTECTION. THE TREASURE ORANGE COUNTY HAD NO SKIN IN THE GAME HE HAD HE DIDN'T OWN THAT POOL HE DIDN'T WITH WHETHER HE DID WELL OR NOT DIDN'T MATTER EVEN GET PAID EXTRA YOU DIDN'T HAVE. TO LOSE ANY STOCK PRICE AND THAT'S THE SAME THING WITH THE C. E. A IF IT DOES WELL. GREAT WIN IF IT DOES BAD WE ALL LOSE ALL OF A SERVICE BIG HOLDERS IN THE C. E. A AND SO I'M REAL CONCERNED. WHEN WE HAVE A INSURANCE COMPANY THAT HAS HAD A REALLY GOOD EXPERIENCE RATIO? IT'S IT'S NOW SAYING ALL MY GOODNESS WE'VE WE'VE GOT SOME EXTRA REVENUE. WHY DON'T WE DO? THIS. REVIEW FURNISHING OF HOMES THIS -- WE KEEP SAYING IT OVER AND OVER THIS BREAK BRAZEN BALL. BUT THIS TO A FOR EVERYBODY WELL WHY ARE WE LOOKING AT IT LIKE A LIKE THE SOLAR ENERGY INDUSTRY WHY DON'T WE IF YOU GOT A MILLION SHAREHOLDERS BILLION POLICY HOLD POLICY OLDER. WE SHOULD BE. BRACING AND BOLTING THEIR HOMES IN AND SAYING HEY FOR THE FOR THE FACT THAT YOU BRACE YOUR HOME WE'RE GOING TO REDUCE YOUR PREMIUM BY X. AMOUNT AND YOU CAN RECOVER. THE COST OF YOUR BRACING AND BOLTING BY THE REDUCTION OF PREMIUMS OVER A FIVE OR TEN YEAR. PERIOD THAT'S HOW YOU DISTRIBUTE SOME OF YOUR EXCESS. PROFITS BUT THE REST OF THOSE PROFITS SHOULD BE BUILT UP IN RESERVES SO YOU CAN REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF YOUR REINSURANCE AMOUNTS BUT YOU REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF THE POLICY PREMIUM JAPAN. THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING AS AN INSURANCE COMPANY AND SO. HERTZBERG I REALLY APOLOGIZE I AM JUST MY SKIN'S COMING OFF. MY BODY HERE I I MEAN I'VE LOOKED AT THIS SIZE BUT THAT. THE TIME WITH WITH LANDO YOU KNOW LAST WEEK. LOOKING AT IT I'M GOING Y. C. A.'S HAS BEEN A LUCKY INSURANCE COMPANY AND NOW IT'S GOT A SHINY OBJECT. THIS GRAYSON BOLT. OPPORTUNITY THAT'S NOT A CORE BUSINESS JOB THAT TO MISSION CREEP. AND I THINK. HERTZBERG. THIS IS ME ARE ARE ARE REALLY -- SCARY PROPOSITION. YOU KNOW I TO MAKE. INSURANCE COMPANIES. INVOLUNTARY CO SIGNERS. THAT IS SOMETHING IF THE NEVER HAPPENED AND I WAS TOLD AS A KID NEVER SAY NEVER BUT WHEN THE NEVER HAPPENS. ALL THESE INNOCENT PARTIES NOW. ARE SUBJECT TO CHARGING THEIR POLICY HOLDERS A SMALL LITTLE PRIMA REAL TINY. BUT EVERYBODY GETS HIT WITH THEY DIDN'T ASK. AND THEY DIDN'T GET A QUID PRO QUO WHAT ARE THEY GETTING. YOU KNOW BEFORE STEPPING UP ITS LIKE IF MY SON DEFAULTS ON A LOAN I GOT TO PAY FOR IT WHEN I NEVER I DON'T MEMBERS CO SIGNING. ON THE WHOLE ONE SO WHAT WE ARE I'M I'M HAVING SOME REAL ANGST SENATOR HERTZBERG AYE I GET THE CREATIVITY. I DON'T SEE IT IS BRILLIANT HOWEVER AND I DON'T SEE IT AS A STRING FOR THE PRINCES I THINK IT T. IT IT IT CREATES SO MUCH EXPOSURE UNNECESSARILY I THINK I THINK WE GOT TO GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD. IN THE END I WILL BE A NO VOTE -- YEAH I APOLOGIZE FOR GETTING A LITTLE. EMOTIONAL BECAUSE I'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE AND I'VE JUST SEEN HOW MANY PEOPLE GET HURT BY A CREATIVE IDEA. THAT. IS DONE BY GOVERNMENT OFFICIALS WHO HAVE NO SKIN IN THE GAME. IF THEY'RE ELECTED THEY'RE GONE. AFTER FOUR YEARS OR EIGHT YEARS AND IF IT BLOWS UP THEN THEN THEY'RE GONNA I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AND SO I I'M TALKING WILL TOO MUCH BUT WE'RE CREATING A PROGRAM TAKE SECURE CHOICE I HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT TOO THAT WE'RE CREATE A WHOLE NEW DEPARTMENT ONLY PROGRAM. IN IN IN IN WHO GETS CAUGHT WITH EXPOSURE WILL YOU KNOW GOVERNMENT WHICH IS THE TAXPAYERS. I DON'T LIKE THE IDEA SORRY. HERTZBERG. I'M A NO VOTE THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR MAROC SENATOR DODD CENTER BOARD JUST IN AND CENTER ARCHULETA SENATOR DODD. WHAT IS USED TODAY IN A LOT OF DIFFERENT? BELIEVES THAT HAVE A LOT OF MOVING PARTS IN THE CERTAINLY IS ONE OF YEAH I'VE GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS -- YOUR QUESTIONS -- THAT PRESUMABLY BEEN ANSWERED BUT YET THE THE BIG QUESTION. I THAT'S NOT A ANSWERED THAT CAN'T BE ANSWERED IS. YEAH WHAT IS THE LIKELIHOOD. YO OF THAT EVENT THERE COULD TRIGGERED THESE ASSESSMENTS -- ONE SIDE OF ME. YES CERTAINLY I HAVE A LOT OF FAITH AND TRUST AND THE PEOPLE THAT TO OUR RUNNING -- THIS BILL. CLEARLY SENATOR HERTZBERG -- INTO ONE PART OF ME WANTS -- TO YOUR VOTE FOR THIS TO ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION. WITH THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. BUT YEAH. OR IF IF THESE ISSUES ARE NOT TAKEN CARE OF YEAH I CERTAINLY RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE MY MIND AND SAY HEY. WE JUST DID THAT GET THERE. AND BELIEVE ME. WITH BIG IDEAS A BIG ISSUES LIKE THIS. YOU NEED MORE TIME. ANY -- I DON'T KNOW WHY IT IS BUT YOU KNOW WE IT WAS WE WERE AROUND HERE AND FOR THE FIRST TWO AND A HALF MONTHS OF THE LEGISLATIVE YEAR AGO DO A HELL OF A LOT. THEN IT ALL COMES IN AT THE AD AND WE'RE EXPECTED TO MAKE THESE DECISIONS AND YEAH -- IN -- A VERY VERY QUICKLY AND THAT IS VERY CONCERNING TO ME. BUT I I KNOW. THAT -- I MAY BE COMING TO THE TABLE -- WITH -- A PROGRAM BEFORE JULY TENTH WORKING WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT MAY INCLUDE SOMETHING JUST LIKE THIS THE INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE NOT GONNA LIE. AND THEY'RE GOING TO RESIST YEAH AND I'M GONNA WHAT THIS GUY'S VOTE. ALLOW US TO CONTINUE MOVING FORWARD. SO THAT WE CAN GET TO THE RIGHT PLACE TO PROTECT CALIFORNIANS AND THEIR RATES. SO IT'S NOT ALWAYS ABOUT YOUR AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'VE GOT TO PAY YOU KNOW THAT WERE YOU KNOW WERE ULTIMATELY GONNA. GO PAY MORE I SO I CAN THAT'S MY OFFICE BUT NOW I WANT TO ASK A COUPLE QUESTIONS IF I MAY MISTER CHAIR -- TO THE INSURANCE COMPANIES. I DO YOU GUYS VALUE TEN BILLION DOLLARS AT WHICH I UNDERSTAND -- OVER TEN YEARS. ALL RIGHT THAT'S ONE BILLION DOLLAR ONE BILLION DOLLARS OVER TEN YEARS WHICH I UNDERSTAND A LOT OF WHICH IS GOING. IT'S WE ONLY INSURE 13%. FOR EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WE'VE GOT. SOME PERCENTAGE OF THAT ONE BILLION DOLLARS A LARGE PORTION. IT'S GOING. TO YOUR CLIENT YOUR CLIENTS CLIENTS IF YOU WILL [inaudible] THAT. WE'LL MAKE YOUR CLIENTS PAY LESS MONEY. I YELL AT THE END OF THE DAY BECAUSE THEIR HOMES. I HAVEN'T GOTTEN THE BRACING AND THE BOLTING THAT THEY NEED -- DO VALUE THAT AT ALL. WE FROM. HIM AGAIN JOHN OR WOULD FOR THE INDEPENDENT TURNS AGES SOCIAL ASIAN I THINK WE LIKE VERY MUCH THE RESEMBLE PROGRAM I THINK WE WOULD. SUPPORT OF NOW FIRE RETRO OF THE PROGRAM DONE THE RIGHT WAY AND YOU KNOW THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS TO TALK ABOUT I MEAN. TO IT WE DO WE HAD A BLUE SKY SESSION LAST NIGHT. DO A LOT OF THINGS ON THE TABLE THIS IS A IT'S A TOUGH POSITION TO BE IN BECAUSE ON ONE HAND OBVIOUSLY WE RESPECT MR HERTZBERG. AND WE KNOW THE YEAH THIS IS A VERY COMPLEX JUST DISCUSSION THERE'S A LOT OF BALLS KIND OF IN THE AIR HERE ON THE AND SO. YOU KNOW WE'VE INDICATED WE CONTINUE ROLE THIS BILL MOVES TODAY WERE CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK ON THIS THING. IN ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION SENATOR ABOUT IS THERE ONE AMENDMENT NOW THERE'S I MEAN I DON'T THINK THERE'S ONE AMENDMENT OTHER THAN DON'T. ASSESS ALL THE CENTERS OF BUT HERE THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO SIT HERE AND YEAH LESSEN THE SERIOUSNESS THE HEY YOU KNOW IT'S UP THAT MY CLIENTS FEEL -- PART OF AS INSURANCE AGENTS AND BROKERS AS A SURPLUS LINES BROKERS AND THINGS LIKE THAT. ON IT WOULD. HOW TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CLIENTS I MEAN SO MOST OF OUR AGENTS MAY BE RIGHT 30% -- PERSONAL LINES INSURANCE THE REALLY HEAVY AND AND COMMERCIAL LINES THERE'S NO NEXUS THE SAME COMMERCIAL LINES AT ALL -- YOU MAY BE THERE WOULD BE FOR COMMERCIAL HAVE JUST FOR INFO COMMERCIAL PROPERTY OR MAYBE IF YOU KNOW THINGS LIKE THAT THERE'S YEAH THERE'S A CERTAIN. THINGS TO THINK ABOUT HERE I HOPE THAT ANSWERS YOUR QUESTION. REALLY GREAT LET ME JUST YEAH. SO CAME SHARES ARE SO YOU'VE IT'S SO ESSENTIALLY YOU'RE REPRESENTING AGENTS AND BROKERS WHAT ABOUT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES THEMSELVES. DO THEY VALUE. THIS IDEA THAT THE BRACE BOLT PROGRAM IS IS -- I TAKING CARE OF PROBLEMS THAT COULD COST THEM A LOT OF MONEY IF THAT. CATACLYSMIC EVENT -- TRANSPIRE. SHERRI MCCUE REPRESENT PACIFIC ASSOCIATION DOMESTIC INSURANCE COMPANIES WE REPRESENT THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZED MESSICK INSURANCE COMPANIES IN THE STATE. THAT WE CALL OURSELVES THE HOME TEAM WE WERE THE ONES THAT WERE HERE IN NINETEEN NINETY FOUR FOLLOWING NORTH NORTHRIDGE WHEN THE BIG CARRIERS. PUT A MORATORIUM ON NEW HOMEOWNERS BUSINESS BECAUSE OF THE EARTHQUAKE OFFER -- MY FOLKS FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT YES THEY DO SO MAYBE THEY'VE EMBRACED EMBRACEABLE PROGRAM BUT THEY ALSO FEEL VERY STRONGLY THAT THIS IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE THAT THE BIGGER CARRIERS GET OVER THE SMALL TO MEDIUM SIZE CARRIERS THAT ARE. COMMITTED TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THEY DON'T HAVE A CHOICE TO PULL OUT OF THE STATE FOLLOWING A CATASTROPHE AND RIGHT BUSINESS AND FORTY OTHER NINE STATE TO STAY IN BUSINESS. MY CARRIERS HAD TO STAY IN BUSINESS AND CONTINUE TO WRITE BUSINESS -- ON A DAILY BASIS FOLLOWING NORTHRIDGE WERE THEY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CREATION TO SEE A YEAH IT'S STABILIZE THE HOMEOWNERS MARKET FOR SURE. BUT THEY WERE ALSO VERY COGNIZANT OF THE FACT THAT IT ALSO MADE THE BIGGER CARRIERS MORE COMPETITIVE. THAT WOULD SEE A JUST ANNOUNCED A RATE DECREASE IN DECEMBER. AND MY CARRIERS. IT TOOK NOTICE OF IT FOR CERTAIN THE UNDERSTAND THAT THE C. A. WAS CREATED TO STABILIZE THE HOMEOWNERS INSURANCE MARKET PLACE AND IT WORKED AND WE ARE VERY HAPPY ABOUT THAT WE'RE THRILLED THAT THEY'RE ABLE -- TO WORK ON THE THE BRACE SYMBOL PROGRAM IT DOES HELP ALL PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA BUT WE ARE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THIS NEW NOTION. OF CHANGING TWENTY TWO PLUS YEARS OF KIND OF A DEAL BETWEEN THE NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS AND THE PARTICIPATING ANSWERS AS I MENTIONED IN MY TESTIMONY WE WHEN WE CREATED THE SEE A I WAS HERE FOR WE'VE MADE IT VERY CLEAR THAT THE FOUR WALLS AROUND THE C. E. A WERE. DESIGNED TO PROTECT BOTH PARTICIPATING INSURERS AND NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS PARTICIPATING INSURERS DO NOT WANT NON PARTICIPATING INSURANCE POLICY HOLDERS ENTERING THE C. E. A THROUGH THOSE FOUR SOLID WALLS THAT WERE BUILT. TO PROTECT THE P. EYES BUT NOW THE P. EYES ARE CA ARTS TRYING TO COME OUT FROM OVER THE FOUR WALLS INTO THE NON PARTICIPATING ENSURE SPACE. FOR THEIR BENEFITS AND FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE CA AND GRANTED THE BENEFIT OF OTHERS THAT CAN EMBRACE YOU KNOW BE PART OF RECENT POLLS. BUT IT IS BEYOND JUST BRACING BOLD IN MY CARRIERS OPINIONS ARE BECAUSE IT'S REALLY A NEW PRESIDENT AND SOMETHING IT TOOK US YEARS TO CREATE THE CA SIX TWO YEARS REALLY. THREE QUITE FRANKLY TO REALLY CREATE IT AND GET IT BUILT AND OUR BIGGEST CONCERN WAS THE EARTH WAS GONNA SHAKE ON DAY ONE AND WE'VE BEEN LUCKY ENOUGH THAT HAS NOT WHERE YOU'RE REALLY SAYING IS. IS ME IS THE BENEFIT. OF THE BRACE AND BOLT. DOESN'T COMPARE WITH WHAT YOU FEEL THAT THAT. THE NEGATIVE DOWNSIDE WOULD BE OF THE SENTENCE. SOMEHOW BREAKING THE CORNERSTONE OF THE FOUR WALLS. THAT IS CORRECT [inaudible] HEY. I I GUESS I I GUESS I'VE I'VE GOT SOME ISSUES WITH -- THE FACT THAT. NO I I WE STILL -- KNOWS 87% OF THESE FUNDS GOING TO NOT SEE A A CUSTOMER. BUT WE WERE AT THE UP SEVENTY SEVEN SEVENTY EIGHT HUNDRED HOMES RETROFITTED SIX THOUSAND THEM HAVE BEEN TO NON C. PLUS CUSTOMERS. BUT BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT IT'S GOING. TO OUR NON PARTICIPATING INSURANCE. EARTHQUAKE POLICY HOLDERS THESE IS CERTAINLY COULD THERE'S NO RESTRICTION WHATSOEVER ABOUT WHO HAS THE HOMEOWNER'S POLICY IT WOULD TOTALLY GNOSTIC ABOUT THAT RIGHT BUT YOU TO DO THAT. DO YOU KNOW WITH IF THEIR HOMEOWNER'S INSURANCE. IT'S WITH A PARTICIPATING INSURER NON PARTICIPATING INSURERS THAT QUESTION I DON'T CAPTURE THAT INFORMATION WE DON'T WE DON'T CARE WHO'S INSURERS IT RIGHT WITH THE WITH THAT YOU JUST KNOW THEY DON'T HAVE EARTHQUAKE WAS CA. YES THAT SIX THOUSAND ON FM NO WAY BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE I'M SORRY TENER BUT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU HAVE YOUR QUESTIONS ANSWERED. THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU SIR. OUR NEXT WE'RE GONNA GO TO SENATOR BRIDGES PLEASE. THIRTY SPOKE -- IS THE BRAZEN BOLD PROGRAM -- MANDATORY. IT'S NOT. AND THAT SEEMS TO BE BASED ON THE QUESTIONS I HEARD FROM CENTER -- GLAZER AND MAYBE CENTER ROTH. TO IS THAT ONE OF IS THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT OBJECTIVE. OF FOR YOU US HERTZBERG YES ALL RIGHT. SO. THIS IS NOT QUITE THE ON POINT BUT WE'VE A NITRATE PROBLEM. IN THE VALLEY. AND ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WE HAD IS SEPTIC SYSTEMS IN LEAKAGE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. SO THE PROGRAM THAT WAS PUT FORWARD -- WAS REALLY QUITE SIMPLE THAT THIS WAS A COLLECTIVE PROBLEM -- EVEN THOUGH IT INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS WERE RESPONSIBLE FOR LEAKAGE AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. AND SO HOOKING UP TO A MAIN LINE AS OPPOSED TO A SEPTIC SYSTEM WAS THE OBJECTIVE HOW DID YOU ACHIEVE THAT IN AN EQUITABLE WAY -- THAT -- MADE THAT THREE TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLAR. PRICE TAG PALATABLE WHICH SOUNDS LIKE YOUR BRACE PROGRAM IS AROUND THAT YES. GIVE OR TAKE. THE BILL THOUGH [inaudible] WHAT'S THAT. BUT IF YOU LAST YEAR OKAY YOUR MIND. I GUESS THE IDEA WAS IS THAT IF WE GAVE -- INDIVIDUALS THREE TO FIVE YEARS. MAYBE SOME MEASURE THE FINANCING MECHANISM IF NECESSARY. OR UPON A PURCHASE A TRANSFER OF TITLE. THAT IT BE MANDATORY THAT YOU HAVE A RETROFIT IS THIS OLD. GARBER FOR YOU YOU MENTION YOU DID SOMETHING LAST YEAR ON THIS OKAY. SO HOW IS THAT NOT ACHIEVING WHAT YOUR GOAL IS. FOR LEASE PART OF THIS AT LEAST PART OF THIS PROGRAM. WE HAVE 13% OF THE PEOPLE IN CALIFORNIA [inaudible] EARTHQUAKE POLICIES. WE HAVE AN EVENT THAT NOT WE LIVE IN THE FOREST 83% OF CALIFORNIANS LIVE IN EARTHQUAKE ZONES. WE KNOW THAT PEOPLE WHEN THEY DON'T FEEL THE PRESSURE DON'T WRITE THE CHECK. OUR JOB IN GOVERNMENT IS TO GET AHEAD OF THAT GAME. FOR FREE FOR FOLKS AND PEOPLE OF ALL SORTS OF OTHER PRESSURES OF THEIR LIVES AND COST OF THE THINGS THAT THEY'VE GOT TO PAY. BUT THEN WHEN THEY FAIL TO COVER WE HAD TWENTY TWO THOUSAND PEOPLE THAT HOMES IN THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY DURING THAT EARTHQUAKE. WE EACH EXTRAORDINARY I LIVE THROUGH IT. AND IN OTHER WORDS AND SO THE QUESTION HERE IS IT'S EASY TO SIT BACK AND ANALYZE IT'S HARD TO PUT THE THERE'S NO CONSTITUENCY FOR THE FUTURE. EVERYBODY WHO'S GOT A CHECKBOOK IN THE PASTOR ASPECT AT YOUR BILL SOMEBODY'S GONNA WANT TO KEEP THOSE REVENUE STREAMS OUR JOB IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST IS TO THINK IT THROUGH IN A BIGGER WAY ALLAH DRESS OR MORE LOCKS IN MY CLOTHES. POINTS IN MY CLOTHES BUT BUT CLEARLY THE IDEA IS TO TRY TO GET IS BEHIND IT LITERALLY IF YOU CAN GET TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR BASS AND BULL AND WE HAVE A TEN YEAR EVENT TO RISE AND THIS IS A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON MITIGATING. COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WITH WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS SOCIETY BECAUSE WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IS JUST LIKE EVERY IS WORD -- MIKE AUTUMN WAS GONNA PLANE I GOT FIFTY DOLLARS MORE ON MY WHATEVER MY TH POLICY IS TO GET A PLAN PLANE THE GOVERNMENT A LOT MORE WHEN THEY'RE WET WHEN THEY'RE COMPOUNDS ARE COMPLETELY DESTROYED. BUT ALL THESE OTHER THINGS OCCUR AND WE'RE GOING TO SIT THERE AND TRY TO FIGURE IT OUT AND THE MORE WE CAN DO TO MITIGATE THAT UP FRONT EARLY BEFORE THE CATASTROPHE. IS WHAT MOTIVATES ME TO PROPOSE OPPOSE THIS BILL LYNN LIMIT. OF FINISH WITH THIS. YOU A THOUGHT THAT THIS WOULD BE A POLICY. OR PROGRAM THAT WOULD BRING ABOUT YOUR DESIRED. OUTCOME AND IT'S NOT HAPPENED. ANOTHER THE BASEBALL PROGRAM THAT EXISTS IS VERY MINIMAL AND ONLY DOES COUPLE THOUSAND A YEAR I WANT TO EXPAND ITS TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND YEARS SO WE CAN WITH THE SAVINGS TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN. NO I I GUESS THE WHERE'S THE OWNERS THE IDEA THAT WE HAD IN THE VALLEY WAS THE ONUS WAS ON THE HOMEOWNER. TO BRING UP THEMSELVES ESSENTIALLY UP TO CODE IF YOU WILL. IS THAT NOT SOMETHING THAT YOU CONTEMPLATED OR MAYBE DISCARDED IT BUT WHEN YOU DO CALL TO PLAY WAS THAT SOMETHING THAT YOU FOUND ON STUFF LIKE THAT I CONTEMPLATED THE FACT THAT. WITHOUT IMPOSING UPON OTHER IMPORTANT CRITICAL FUNCTIONS OF GOVERNMENT TO ASK FOR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS THERE WAS A WAY TO MAKE THAT WORK AND I'LL EXPLAIN IN MORE DETAIL ON MY CLOTHES TO RESPOND MR MORLOCKS SENSITIVITIES. OKAY FROM FROM MY PERSONAL IN RIGHT HERE IS THAT -- I'M GONNA HOLD OFF ON VOTING BECAUSE I WANT TO SEE WHERE YOU GO WITH THIS I DON'T NECESSARILY WANT TO SAY NO THIS IS NOT HOLD OFF FROM VOTING I MAY NOT BE ABLE TO GO ANYWHERE. RIGHT -- I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU -- WE'RE FURTHER DISCUSSIONS TAKE THIS SO WE'LL SEE HOW THE OTHER VOTES LINE UP BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE HOUSES YOU HAVE IN HIS DISTRICT WE SEND THE MOMENT WAS THAT THE TO GET IT DID YOU KNOW YOU DON'T A BRACE IN BOTH THEIR HOMES. OKAY. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MR CHILENA YOU HAVE FURTHER QUESTIONS. WE GO BACK TO SHELVE IT. EARLIER. IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW. WHEN? IF WE DON'T DO IT NOW WHEN. AND IF WE DO IT HYPOTHETICALLY TEN YEARS FROM NOW WHEN IT KICKS IN -- A HUNDRED YEARS FROM NOW WHEN IT KICKS IN. AND YOU'RE SAYING THAT'S TOO LATE HOW HOW WAS THAT TOO LATE IF WILL BECAUSE IF I CAN'T COME IN AND WE COULD START THIS NOW CENTER HYPOTHETICALLY AND WE COULD BOTH BRACED TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES. AND LET'S ASSUME AT TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND HOMES A YEAR RIGHT TEN YEARS TO EARN FIFTY THOUSAND AND KEPT IN IN TWENTY YEARS IS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND HOMES WE HAVE LITERALLY CUT IN HALF THE DAMAGE IS GOING TO BE DONE BY A BIG EARTHQUAKE. BECAUSE WE'RE DOING PREVENTATIVE MEASURES LIKE GOING OUT AND SPENDING MONEY TO CLEAR I HELD A BIG HEARING WHEN I WAS CHAIRMAN OF NATURAL RESOURCES. TALKING ABOUT CLEARING OUT THE TREES NO ONE WANTED TO PAY ATTENTION NOW ALL OF A SUDDEN THE TREES ARE BURNING AND EVERYBODY'S SAYING ALL MY GOD LET'S PUT BILLIONS TO IT WE COULD SPEND TEN CENTS ON THE DOLLAR TO DO WHAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT -- INFORMATIONAL HEARING THAT'S WE'RE TRYING TO DO HERE. IT'S HARD TO HAVE A CONSTITUENCY FOR THE FUTURE BECAUSE WE'RE TRYING TO BE PREVENTIVE AND IT'S EASY TO THROW ROADBLOCKS BUT IF YOU HAD A HALF A MILLION HOMES THAT WERE BRACING BOLD OR SOME APARTMENT BUILDINGS ALIKE. THE DAMAGE THAT WOULD BE DONE IN THOSE EARTHQUAKE WRITTEN AREAS WOULD BE DRAMATICALLY LESS AND PEOPLE WOULD BE LESS IMPACTED IN TERMS OF THEIR LIVES THAT'S ALL WE'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS MEASURE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I BELIEVE NEXT OF MISTER PORTANTINO IS HE STILL HERE YOU HAD SOME QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THIS IS THE VERY VERY. THOROUGH CONVERSATION OBVIOUSLY THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO DO TODAY I'M GONNA SUPPORT. THE CHAIRS AYE RECOMMENDATION BUT OBVIOUSLY AS THIS MOVES INTO A PROBE THERE'S A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE. AND WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING AT THE OVERALL FISCAL IMPACT AND I'LL BE WORKING WITH THE WITH THEAUTHOR AND EVERYONE -- BECAUSE I YOU KNOW IT'S NOT NOT COOKED YET BUT NOW WILL CONTINUE THE CONVERSATION BUT DO MORE WORK SO JUST RESERVE THAT RIGHT THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN TELL YOU I TELL EVERYBODY I KNOW CENTER DOGS OUT HERE WAS HERE NOW. IN OUR CHIRLA **** THAT. I'M NOT GONNA MOVE THIS BILL FORWARD ON TO THE FLOOR IF IT'S A TAX WITH ISSUE NUMBER ONE AND NUMBER TWO IF THE SUBSTANTIAL QUESTIONS AREN'T OTHERWISE ANSWERED. TRYING TO DO I THINK A RESPONSIBLE THING I WANT TO CONTINUE THE DISCUSSION IF I HAD A HORRIBLE MEETING LAST NIGHT WITH THE INDUSTRY FOLKS I FELT THERE WAS NO HOPE. BUT WE DISCUSSED A NUMBER OF THINGS IT'S NOT EASY -- BUT OKAY IT'S NOT EASY LET'S FIGURE IT OUT AND LET'S DEAL WITH THE ISSUES THAT CENTER MORLOCK HE'S CORRECT HE DEALT WITH THIS IN ORANGE COUNTY I DON'T THINK IS ANALYSIS WORKS HERE. AND I'LL HAVE A CONVERSATION OFFLINE BECAUSE WE SPEND TOO MUCH TIME IN THIS HEARING ALREADY BUT I JUST WANT TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS I THINK IT'S A I THINK THESE PEOPLE ARE PROFESSIONAL. I THINK THE ORGANIZATION IS WORTHY I THINK YOU CAN PUT THE CHECKS AND BALANCES IN THEIR NECESSARY THAT EVERY QUESTION HERE THAT WAS ASKED. I CERTAINLY HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE ADVOCATES THAT ARE OPPOSING THEY'RE GREAT THE HONORABLE PEOPLE AND I THINK THE REAL ISSUES THAT THEY RAISED I CAN SEE SOLUTIONS FORWARD. IT DOESN'T HAPPEN IT DOESN'T HAPPEN BUT I JUST THINK IT'S OUR OBLIGATION TO GIVE IT A SHOT AND AND AND I I DON'T THINK I WOULD SAY IT WOULD SENATOR GLAZERS SAID WHICH I I JUST DON'T FEEL. AN EINER SO HE SAYS ON THE PRESSURE STUFF BECAUSE THIS IS AN ORGANIZATION ALREADY EXIST THAT'S BEEN THINKING THIS STUFF THROUGH IN A SIGNIFICANT WAY. AND I FEEL PRETTY COMFORTABLE AND I I'VE BEEN I'VE BEEN SPENDING WHAT SIX MONTHS ON THIS THING PROBABLY IN PRETTY SIGNIFICANT AND HARSH DETAIL. GIVEN THEM A PRETTY SIGNIFICANT HAIR CUT AS SOME OF YOU PEOPLE RECORD -- EVIDENCE YOU TO DO THAT I WOULDN'T GOING TO TAKE THIS BILL IN THE SEA THE IT GAVE ME CONFIDENCE. THAT I THOUGHT THAT THERE WAS A WAY FORWARD QUESTIONS YOU'RE TOTALLY REASONABLE -- AND I HAVE NO QUARREL WITH THAT AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK IT DOESN'T WORK THAT'S WHAT LIFE'S ABOUT YOU GIVE IT A SHOT. BUT I DO WANT THE OPPORTUNITY TO GIVE IT A SHOT AND I COMMIT TO YOU THAT I AM GOING NO WHERE WHETHER IT'S APPROPRIATIONS PASSED OR TO THE FLOOR TO PUT ANYBODY IN HARM'S WAY PARTICULAR TAX MEASURE THAT WON'T HAPPEN. AND SO WE HAVE MISTER JOHNS. THANK YOU MA'AM TURN AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR CLOTHES THIS IS JUST A RECOMMENDATION FROM THE VICE CHAIR TO THE COMMITTEE. YOU KNOW THERE'S A COUPLE THINGS I KNOW NUMBER ONE I KNOW THAT SOONER HERTZBERG IS AN HONORABLE PERSON WHEN HE SAYS HE'S GONNA WORK ON SOMETHING HE TO WORK ON SOMETHING AND ISN'T DOING HE SAYS -- A BUT THIS IS THE PROPER VENUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION -- THE INSURANCE COMMITTEE THE CONSULTANTS IN THIS COMMITTEE OUR IS THE PROPER VENUE TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION -- ICE. THINK THAT THERE CAN BE A SOLUTION WORKED OUT -- ONE OF THE THINGS I ALSO KNOW FROM MY EXPERIENCE IN THE LEGISLATURE IS BIG IDEAS -- REQUIRE GOOD CONVERSATION. AND ONE BIG IDEAS ARE RUSHED THROUGH EITHER HOUSE. THE RUSH THROUGH INEFFICIENTLY THEIR RUSHED THROUGH WITH. MISTAKES THERE RUSHED THROUGH -- NOT BUILDING THE CONSENSUS THAT YOU NEED TO HAVE A GOOD IN THE PRODUCT. SO I ALWAYS LIKE JUST TRY TO START. WITH THE END IN MIND IN THE END IS WE WANT TO GET A GOOD BILL WE ONE HAVE A GOOD PRODUCT -- SO I'M GONNA RECOMMEND TO MY COLLEAGUES ON BOTH SIDES THAT -- EITHER VOTE NO. OR HOLD OFF ON THE BILL. A ALLOW SOONER HERTZBERG TO WORK WITH THIS COMMITTEE THE CONSULTANTS IN THIS COMMITTEE I TO GET A BILL THAT -- MAKES SENSE AND THAT WE CAN HOPEFULLY ALL SUPPORT. I WHEN IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS AND THE FLOOR -- THANK YOU THANK YOU. ANY MORE QUESTIONS. LIKE MAKE ANOTHER COMMENT AGAINST A THANK YOU AND AND I LEARNED FROM A A VERY -- BRIGHT INDIVIDUAL AND SAID BOB ARCHER LEAD WHEN YOU GOT ON BOARD ALWAYS REMEMBER YOUR DISTRICT. AND WHICH I HOPE YOU COME TOGETHER IN SOME WAY BECAUSE UP WITH TEARS IN MY DISTRICT WE HAD THE WHITTIER EARTHQUAKE. AT THAT'S IMPORTANT BUT I I STILL THINK THAT THERE'S SOME ISSUES THERE THAT YOU YOU HAVE YOU GOT TO BRING TOGETHER. AND AND SO AND I DON'T THINK YOU'RE DONE YET. SO I I DON'T WANT TO VOTE NO -- TOTALLY BUT I I I WANT YOU TO GET BACK TOGETHER SO THE ONLY WAY YOU'RE GONNA DO THAT. IS TO TAKE THIS FORD WITH THE AGREEMENT THAT YOU'RE GOING TO MEET AGAIN AND AND COME BACK. AND HOWEVER THAT'S DONE -- I I THINK -- AND THEN I CAN BE SUPPORTED. THANK YOU AND MORE COMMENTS. SO WITH THAT I WILL SAY -- I DO APPRECIATE THE LIVELY DISCUSSION KERRY THERE'S A LOT OF CONCERNS I THINK I'LL SAY IT -- I REPEAT WHAT OUR AND GLAZER SAID THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT'S VERY CHALLENGING. A LOT TO WRAP YOUR HEAD AROUND BUT I DO KNOW THE INTENT OF THE BILL IS IS GOOD AND I KNOW MR HERTZBERG IS VERY. UP COMMITTED TO THE SAFETY OF CALIFORNIANS AND I KNOW WHY YOU'RE DOING IT BUT I'M ALSO ENCOURAGED BY THE FACT THAT THE UNITED SPEAK TO BOTH SIDES. THAT THEY'RE STILL TALKING AND IT WAS A VERY PRODUCTIVE MEETING LAST NIGHT AND THEY'RE COMING TOGETHER IN AGREEMENT AS TO HOW THEY'RE GONNA MOVE BUT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT THERE YET BUT BOTH SEEM. TO THINK THAT DOUBT WE'RE HEADED IN A VERY POSITIVE DIRECTION -- YOU KNOW I DO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE TAX WHICH IS NOT TAX BUT MISTER. IN ORDER HERTZBERG DID EXPRESS WANTING TO ADD LANGUAGE THAT INCLUDES A WILL NOT MOVE FORWARD UNTIL HE GETS ON A CLARIFICATION FROM THAT'S COUNCIL THAT IT'S NOT A TAX.

THEY MAKE A SIZEABLE INVESTMENT IN THE GOOD FAITH THAT THE INVESTMENT WILL BE PAID OUT WHEN THEY PASS ON IT MAY BE THE FACT THAT THE INDUSTRY NORM IS TO LEAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF CLAIM AND INVESTMENT TO THE STATE. BUT MANY PEOPLE DO NOT FORMALLY ESTABLISHED IN THE STATE MUCH LESS HAVE AN ATTORNEY MANAGING THEIR AFFAIRS. THIS INDUSTRY NORM HAS PROVEN TO BE UNFAIR UNSUSTAINABLE AND FRANKLY BASE IN THE LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLEMENTS CITED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS PERHAPS NOT EVEN LEGAL. SB SEVEN FORTY ESTABLISHES THE MINIMUM EFFORT ON THE PART OF THE INDUSTRY THAT THE FEEL A REASONABLE EXPECTATION TO THE CONSUMERS. THE BILL REQUIRES LIFE INSURANCE HEARERS. TO CHECK THE NATIONAL DEATH MASTER FILE IN ORDER TO INFORM BENEFICIARIES OF BENEFITS -- TO THEM. SPECIFICALLY IT REQUIRES INSURERS TO DO THREE THINGS NUMBER ONE IDENTIFIED DECEASED INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE BEEN THE FISHERIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. ANNUITIES CONTRACTS OR RETAINED ASSETS ACCOUNTS. NUMBER TWO TO LOCATE BENEFICIARIES OF THOSE DECEASED INDIVIDUALS AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE INSTRUCTIONS FOR THEM TO MAKE A CLAIM. AND THIRD THE BILL IS THE RESULT OF WORK DONE ON THE ISSUE OF UNPAID LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES OVER SEVERAL YEARS BY THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF INSURANCE COMMISSIONERS.
