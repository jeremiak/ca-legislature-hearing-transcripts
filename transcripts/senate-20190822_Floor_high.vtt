01:03:08.484 --> 01:03:09.452
NEED IN CALIFORNIA WE'RE

01:03:09.519 --> 01:03:10.920
DIVERTING THAT OTHER STATES SO.

01:03:10.987 --> 01:03:12.622
THE BIOMASS CONTRACTS THAT WE

01:03:12.688 --> 01:03:13.689
HAVE AVAILABLE TO US NOW ARE

01:03:13.756 --> 01:03:15.358
REALLY CRITICAL BECAUSE THE

01:03:15.424 --> 01:03:16.559
WHEN THE SUN IS NOT SHINING IN

01:03:16.626 --> 01:03:18.127
THE WIND'S NOT BLOWING THEY

01:03:18.194 --> 01:03:19.695
ACTUALLY PRODUCE GREEN POWER

01:03:19.762 --> 01:03:20.696
SO. IT'LL ACTUALLY I THINK

01:03:20.763 --> 01:03:23.266
HELP. ON THE ACE REALLY THIS

01:03:23.332 --> 01:03:25.034
BILLS ABOUT GETTING THOSE FOLKS

01:03:25.101 --> 01:03:26.636
WHO LOST THEIR HOMES WHO DIDN'T

01:03:26.702 --> 01:03:28.404
HAVE INSURANCE ON THEIR SOLAR

01:03:28.471 --> 01:03:29.839
SO. I THINK IT WILL ACTUALLY

01:03:29.906 --> 01:03:32.475
HELP THE BAHAMAS INDUSTRY. OKAY

01:03:32.542 --> 01:03:35.178
THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR OF. SEND

01:03:35.244 --> 01:03:35.912
THEM WE ARE PRODUCING MORE

01:03:35.978 --> 01:03:39.782
SOLAR THAN WE NEED IN THE

01:03:39.849 --> 01:03:40.383
STATE'S AYE. I RECOMMEND A NO

01:03:40.449 --> 01:03:40.917

RESPECTFULLY RISE IN OPPOSITION

01:03:53.429 --> 01:03:55.765
TO THIS BILL I UDERSTAND THE

01:03:55.831 --> 01:03:57.934
INTENT BEHIND THE BILL AND I AM

01:03:58.000 --> 01:04:00.770
SYMPATHETIC TO THE NEEDS OF

01:04:00.836 --> 01:04:02.405
THESE ARE HOMEOWNERS TO BE ABLE

01:04:02.471 --> 01:04:04.373
TO REBUILD QUICKLY AND

01:04:04.440 --> 01:04:06.709
EFFICIENTLY AND THE REASON

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:08.077
HOWEVER THAT I'M OPPOSE THE

01:04:08.144 --> 01:04:10.213
BILL IS THIS IS ACTUALLY NOT A

01:04:10.279 --> 01:04:11.914
NARROW EXEMPTION THIS IS QUITE

01:04:11.981 --> 01:04:14.784
BROAD IT DOESN'T JUST APPLY TO

01:04:14.850 --> 01:04:17.386
A FEW SPECIFIC OF THE HORRIFIC

01:04:17.453 --> 01:04:19.288
FIRES THAT HAPPENED IT APPLIES

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.090
IN ANY DISASTER NATURAL

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:23.826
DISASTER. THAT'S BEEN DECLARED

01:04:23.893 --> 01:04:28.164
WITH NO START TIME. AND IN

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:29.198
FIFTY SEVEN OUT OF FIFTY EIGHT

01:04:29.265 --> 01:04:29.899
COUNTIES DISASTERS HAVE BEEN

01:04:29.966 --> 01:04:31.200
DECLARED SO THIS IS NOT JUST

01:04:31.267 --> 01:04:33.436
ABOUT THE CAMPFIRE OR SOME OF

01:04:33.502 --> 01:04:34.637
THE GROUP OF BUYERS IN THE

01:04:34.704 --> 01:04:36.839
NORTH BAY. OR MENTOR COUNTY

01:04:36.906 --> 01:04:39.308
THIS APPLIES MUCH MORE BOADLY

01:04:39.375 --> 01:04:41.744
THIS IS A LARGE EXEMPTION. FROM

01:04:41.811 --> 01:04:45.548
THE SOLAR ROOF TOP REQUIREMENT

01:04:45.615 --> 01:04:48.484
WHICH IS PART OF CALIFORNIA

01:04:48.551 --> 01:05:06.702
OFFERED TO A 100% PAUL. ENERGY

01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:11.107
.

01:05:11.107 --> 01:05:12.441
OUR FAILED INVESTOR OWNED

01:05:12.508 --> 01:05:16.212
UTILITY MODEL AND SO THIS IS I

01:05:16.279 --> 01:05:18.180
THINK AN IMPORTANT WAY OF

01:05:18.247 --> 01:05:18.748
LOWERING COSTS NOT INCREASE

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:21.984
COSTS. I AM FINALLY ONE OF THE

01:05:22.051 --> 01:05:23.953
REASONS THAT WE HAVE HAD THESE

01:05:24.020 --> 01:05:26.789
HORRIFIC FIRES IS CALIFORNIA'S

01:05:26.856 --> 01:05:30.459
ADDICTION TO INFINITE EXPANSION

01:05:30.526 --> 01:05:31.827
OF DISTRIBUTION AND

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:34.096
TRANSMISSION WIRES IN THE STATE

01:05:34.163 --> 01:05:36.332
OF CALIFORNIA THAT INSTEAD OF

01:05:36.399 --> 01:05:37.900
MOVING TOWARDS A MORE

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:41.003
DECENTRALIZED D. E. R. MODEL WE

01:05:41.070 --> 01:05:42.538
HAVE CONTINUALLY INCREASES

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:44.373
INFRASTRUCTURE WHICH INCREASES

01:05:44.440 --> 01:05:46.776
THE RISK OF WILDFIRE. WE KNOW

01:05:46.842 --> 01:05:49.445
THE DVR'S INCREASE RESILIENCE

01:05:49.512 --> 01:05:52.515
NOT ONLY DOES IT. DECREASE THE

01:05:52.581 --> 01:05:57.286
NEED TO. EXPANDING THIS SYSTEM

01:05:57.353 --> 01:05:59.055
THAT RISKS WILDFIRES BUT IT

01:05:59.121 --> 01:06:00.523
ALSO ENSURES THAT WHEN A WHAT

01:06:00.589 --> 01:06:02.858
WHO WHEN THE SYSTEM GOES DOWN.

01:06:02.925 --> 01:06:04.260
AND WE KNOW THAT P. GINNY THEY

01:06:04.327 --> 01:06:06.595
MIGHT DO MASSIVE POWER SHUT

01:06:06.662 --> 01:06:07.196
DOWNS THROUGHOUT THEIR SERVICE

01:06:07.263 --> 01:06:09.865
TO OUR TERRITORY. THAT PEOPLE

01:06:09.932 --> 01:06:12.468
CAN STILL HAVE ENERGY BECAUSE

01:06:12.535 --> 01:06:14.737
OF THE SOLAR AND THE STORAGE SO

01:06:14.804 --> 01:06:15.905
I JUST DON'T BELIEVE THAT THIS

01:06:15.971 --> 01:06:17.873
IS THE RIGHT DIRECTION IF THIS

01:06:17.940 --> 01:06:19.508
WERE A VERY VERY NARROW

01:06:19.575 --> 01:06:22.845
TARGETED APPROACH WE COULD HAVE

01:06:22.912 --> 01:06:24.313
THAT CONVERSATION BUT IT IS

01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:26.682
ACTUALLY NOT NARROW IT'S QUITE

01:06:26.749 --> 01:06:27.316
BROAD I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR NO

01:06:27.383 --> 01:06:30.619
VOTE. SENATOR STERN. THANK YOU

01:06:30.686 --> 01:06:32.688
MADAM PRESIDENT. I APPRECIATE

01:06:32.755 --> 01:06:36.592
THE. THE SENSITIVITY OF THE

01:06:36.659 --> 01:06:38.961
ISSUE GIVEN THE TRAGEDIES THAT

01:06:39.028 --> 01:06:40.629
HAVE OCCURRED ALL OVER THIS

01:06:40.696 --> 01:06:41.197
STATE I'VE BEEN THROUGH IT

01:06:41.263 --> 01:06:45.101
MYSELF AFTER THE WILL THE FIRE

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:46.535
AND WE'RE GOING THROUGH THE

01:06:46.602 --> 01:06:48.571
RECOVERY AND REBUILDING PROCESS

01:06:48.637 --> 01:06:51.807
OURSELVES RIGHT NOW. PEOPLE

01:06:51.874 --> 01:06:54.076
TRYING TO GET BACK INTO SMALL

01:06:54.143 --> 01:06:55.945
SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENCES SCHOOL

01:06:56.011 --> 01:06:58.314
TEACHERS NURSES FIREFIGHTERS

01:06:58.381 --> 01:07:00.483
WORKING CLASS PEOPLE TRYING TO

01:07:00.549 --> 01:07:03.586
GET THEIR LIVES BACK ON TRACK.

01:07:03.652 --> 01:07:05.121
I'M NOT GONNA BE SUPPORTING THE

01:07:05.187 --> 01:07:08.958
BILL TODAY WITH ALL DUE RESPECT

01:07:09.024 --> 01:07:09.558
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY THINK WE'RE

01:07:09.625 --> 01:07:12.795
GOING TO BE DENYING. THOSE

01:07:12.862 --> 01:07:13.362
HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE TRYING TO

01:07:13.429 --> 01:07:15.731
REBUILD. AN OPPORTUNITY

01:07:15.798 --> 01:07:19.435
ACTUALLY SAVE MONEY. ON IN THE

01:07:19.502 --> 01:07:20.903
LONG TERM AND FRANKLY IN THE

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:22.138
SHORT TERM THERE'S NOT A SOLAR

01:07:22.204 --> 01:07:26.008
ROOF MANDATE. YOU'RE ALLOWED TO

01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:28.344
DOWNSIZE IN FACT THE SIZE OF

01:07:28.411 --> 01:07:30.613
THE GENERATION IF YOU'RE TAKING

01:07:30.679 --> 01:07:32.381
INTO EFFECT OTHER ENERGY

01:07:32.448 --> 01:07:33.582
EFFICIENCY MEASURES THAT YOUR

01:07:33.649 --> 01:07:36.185
HOME. USING GREENER BUILDING

01:07:36.252 --> 01:07:36.719
MATERIALS AND YOU'RE USING

01:07:36.786 --> 01:07:40.923
STORAGE NOW THE CODE DOES SAY

01:07:40.990 --> 01:07:42.591
IF YOU DON'T TAKE ANY OF THOSE

01:07:42.658 --> 01:07:43.225
MEASURES YOU DO HAVE TO INSTALL

01:07:43.292 --> 01:07:46.228
PAN. AND THAT DOES HAVE UP

01:07:46.295 --> 01:07:49.064
FRONT COST I THINK THE ANALYSIS

01:07:49.131 --> 01:07:50.866
SITTING ON THE FLOOR TALKS

01:07:50.933 --> 01:07:51.500
ABOUT ABOUT. AT TEN THOUSAND OR

01:07:51.567 --> 01:07:54.937
MORE. THE CALCULATIONS FROM THE

01:07:55.004 --> 01:07:57.473
ENERGY COMMISSION ARE TWENTY

01:07:57.540 --> 01:07:58.073
THOUSAND OR MORE IN SAVINGS IN

01:07:58.140 --> 01:08:03.779
FACT. AND SO THAT SAVINGS TO

01:08:03.846 --> 01:08:04.513
NINE HOMEOWNERS THE OPPORTUNITY

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.549
THE CHOICE TO ACTUALLY SAVE

01:08:06.615 --> 01:08:08.250
THAT MONEY OVER TIME TO ME

01:08:08.317 --> 01:08:11.954
SEEMS ILL FOUNDED. END AND

01:08:12.021 --> 01:08:15.124
FURTHER MORE YOU KNOW I JUST I

01:08:15.191 --> 01:08:15.624
HAVE TO PUSH BACK ON THE

01:08:15.691 --> 01:08:18.093
PRINCIPLE OF OVER GENERATION

01:08:18.160 --> 01:08:18.694
THAT THERE'S TOO MUCH SOLAR IN

01:08:18.761 --> 01:08:23.799
THIS STATE. IN FACT. SO THERE

01:08:23.866 --> 01:08:25.534
IS THE CHEAPEST FORM OF ENERGY

01:08:25.601 --> 01:08:26.135
BEING PRODUCED IN THE STATE OF

01:08:26.202 --> 01:08:29.371
CALIFORNIA TODAY. ENDS OVER

01:08:29.438 --> 01:08:32.208
GENERATING SOLAR AS THE LA

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:32.808
TIMES HAS REPORTED ON THE VERY

01:08:32.875 --> 01:08:34.910
FRONT PAGE OF THEIR PAPER.

01:08:34.977 --> 01:08:36.011
BASED ON TWO RECENT ANALYSES

01:08:36.078 --> 01:08:38.781
THAT OVER GENERATION. IS

01:08:38.848 --> 01:08:41.650
CHEAPER THAN RUNNING LARGE

01:08:41.717 --> 01:08:43.719
HEAVY ACRE PLANTS AT THAT SAME

01:08:43.786 --> 01:08:47.456
TIME CURTAILING THAT GENERATION

01:08:47.523 --> 01:08:48.724
DURING THOSE PEAK PERIODS IS

01:08:48.791 --> 01:08:50.759
ACTUALLY CHEAPER AGAIN THEN

01:08:50.826 --> 01:08:53.062
RUNNING BIG BASS LOAD GAS POWER

01:08:53.128 --> 01:08:58.501
AT PEAK. SO IT'S IMPORTANT TO

01:08:58.567 --> 01:08:59.435
CHECK THESE PRINCIPLES WHEN YOU

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:01.237
GO IT'S A TOUGH CONTEXT TO DO

01:09:01.303 --> 01:09:04.240
IT IN AND I DO NOT FAULT IN ANY

01:09:04.306 --> 01:09:07.610
WAY THE AUTHOR FOR FIGHTING FOR

01:09:07.676 --> 01:09:08.878
HIS PEOPLE AND I'M TRYING TO DO

01:09:08.944 --> 01:09:11.847
THE SAME SO. THAT'S WHY WILL BE

01:09:11.914 --> 01:09:12.715
SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY.

01:09:12.781 --> 01:09:15.351
SENATOR BRADFORD THANK YOU

01:09:15.417 --> 01:09:16.685
MADAM PRESIDENT I STAND IN

01:09:16.752 --> 01:09:17.953
STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS

01:09:18.020 --> 01:09:19.722
COMMONSENSE MEASURE OF IT'S NOT

01:09:19.788 --> 01:09:22.458
ONLY THAT SOLAR IS BEING OVER

01:09:22.525 --> 01:09:25.027
PRODUCE AND THE STATE OF

01:09:25.094 --> 01:09:25.961
CALIFORNIA WERE PAIN STATES

01:09:26.028 --> 01:09:28.130
LIKE NEVADA THE ODD TO TAKE

01:09:28.197 --> 01:09:30.065
KERR OVERPRODUCED SOLAR THIS

01:09:30.132 --> 01:09:31.700
ALLOWS INDIVIDUALS LOST THEIR

01:09:31.767 --> 01:09:33.469
HOMES RECALLS A WHAT TO TRY TO

01:09:33.536 --> 01:09:37.306
YOU WAS TO REPEAL IT AT A MORE

01:09:37.373 --> 01:09:39.408
AFFORDABLE RATE WE DEAL WITH.

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:41.577
HOUSING CRISIS IN THE STATE ON

01:09:41.644 --> 01:09:44.213
A DAILY BASIS AND IT'S PROVEN

01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:46.682
THAT ADDING SOLAR TO HOMES

01:09:46.749 --> 01:09:48.284
BECAUSE IMPACT THE COSTS OF

01:09:48.350 --> 01:09:49.518
HOMES I'VE TALKED TO DEVELOPERS

01:09:49.585 --> 01:09:51.420
LIKE DOCTOR REALTORS IT DOES

01:09:51.487 --> 01:09:53.255
INCREASE THE COST OF HOMES AND

01:09:53.322 --> 01:09:55.491
WE CAN'T BUILD HOMES AS IT IS

01:09:55.558 --> 01:09:56.091
AND WE'RE GOING TO ADD ANOTHER

01:09:56.158 --> 01:09:59.728
BURDEN TO SOMEONE WAS LOST

01:09:59.795 --> 01:10:00.329
THEIR HOMES. MAKES ABSOLUTELY

01:10:00.396 --> 01:10:02.431
NO SENSE I ASKED FOR A VOTE.

01:10:02.498 --> 01:10:06.268
CENTER GALGIANI. THANK YOU

01:10:06.335 --> 01:10:06.869
MADAM CHAIR WHILE MY DISTRICT

01:10:06.936 --> 01:10:08.070
HAS NOT SUFFERED ANY FIRES MY

01:10:08.137 --> 01:10:08.904
DISTRICT WAS GROUND ZERO FOR

01:10:08.971 --> 01:10:11.006
THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS AND WHEN

01:10:11.073 --> 01:10:12.608
WE THINK ABOUT AFFORDABILITY OF

01:10:12.675 --> 01:10:14.443
HOMES IT'S NOT JUST WHAT THE

01:10:14.510 --> 01:10:16.211
MONTHLY PAYMENT WILL BE FOR THE

01:10:16.278 --> 01:10:18.180
HOME IT'S WHETHER OR NOT THE

01:10:18.247 --> 01:10:21.383
BANK WILL UNDER RIGHT THE LOAN

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:21.984
AND ON A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:10:22.051 --> 01:10:26.555
DOLLAR HOME. IF SOMEBODY AT A

01:10:26.622 --> 01:10:27.923
FOUR HUNDRED AND- LET ME SEE IF

01:10:27.990 --> 01:10:29.525
OF FORTY THOUSAND DOLLARS SOLAR

01:10:29.592 --> 01:10:31.727
SYSTEM WOULD MAKE A DIFFERENCE

01:10:31.794 --> 01:10:33.662
OF TWO HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:35.331
ON A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND

01:10:35.397 --> 01:10:36.632
DOLLAR HOME. AND IF THE BANK

01:10:36.699 --> 01:10:39.335
WON'T QUALIFY SOMEONE FOR A

01:10:39.401 --> 01:10:42.171
LOAN YOU SIMPLY CAN'T GET THE

01:10:42.237 --> 01:10:44.640
HOME. WHETHER YOU THINK YOU CAN

01:10:44.707 --> 01:10:45.941
AFFORD IT OR NOT THE BANK

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:47.576
ASSEMBLY WILL NOT LOAN YOU THE

01:10:47.643 --> 01:10:49.244
MONEY AND A TWO HUNDRED DOLLAR

01:10:49.311 --> 01:10:51.447
A MONTH INCREASE IN A PAYMENT.

01:10:51.513 --> 01:10:52.881
THAT'S SIGNIFICANT FOR MANY

01:10:52.948 --> 01:10:55.284
MANY FAMILIES AND FURTHERMORE

01:10:55.351 --> 01:10:57.586
IF SOMEBODY HAS TO PUT A DOWN

01:10:57.653 --> 01:10:59.622
PAYMENT THAT WOULD BE 20% THE

01:10:59.688 --> 01:11:02.358
EQUIVALENT OF A SOLAR SYSTEM.

01:11:02.424 --> 01:11:03.926
IF THAT SYSTEM WAS SAY FORTY

01:11:03.993 --> 01:11:06.295
THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT'S EIGHT

01:11:06.362 --> 01:11:08.464
THOUSAND DOLLARS MORE IN CASH

01:11:08.530 --> 01:11:09.898
FOR THE LOAN. AND WHEN

01:11:09.965 --> 01:11:10.432
SOMEBODY'S REBUILDING THE

01:11:10.499 --> 01:11:13.736
NUMBERS RIGHT NOT WILL END

01:11:13.802 --> 01:11:14.303
MEMBERS WE HAVE TO TAKE THAT

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:17.339
INTO CONSIDERATION THANK YOU.

01:11:17.406 --> 01:11:20.542
SENATOR DODD. MEMBERS ICE FOR

01:11:20.609 --> 01:11:22.211
US STATED STRONG SUPPORT OF

01:11:22.277 --> 01:11:23.278
THIS BILL AS WELL AS SOMEBODY

01:11:23.345 --> 01:11:24.947

01:11:25.014 --> 01:11:25.514
FOR MY NEIGHBORS LOST THEIR

01:11:25.581 --> 01:11:27.416
HOMES YOUR THROUGHOUT MY ENTIRE

01:11:27.483 --> 01:11:28.884
DISTRICT OVER SIX HUNDRED

01:11:28.951 --> 01:11:33.322
PEOPLE LOST THEIR HOMES IT OVER

01:11:33.389 --> 01:11:33.922
60% OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE UNDER

01:11:33.989 --> 01:11:36.659
INSURED. THEY'RE UNDER INSURED

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.160
THEY CAN'T AFFORD TO REBUILD

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:40.229
THEIR HOMES PROBABLY ANOTHER

01:11:40.295 --> 01:11:42.765
20% OF THOSE PEOPLE ARE

01:11:42.831 --> 01:11:43.732
REBUILDING ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:46.101
JUST CAN'T AFFORD. YANKEE CAN'T

01:11:46.168 --> 01:11:48.237
CAN'T AFFORD THAT YOU KNOW THAT

THE PAYMENTS GOING DOWN THE

01:11:49.571 --> 01:11:51.273
LINE IN ANY OF THE OTHER THING

THIS BUILDING THIS CREATING

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:02.284
AFFORDABLE HOUSING. WE'VE

01:12:02.351 --> 01:12:04.520
ALREADY ARE COUNTY FOR EXAMPLE

01:12:04.586 --> 01:12:06.255
IN NAPA COUNTY IN CINEMA COUNTY

01:12:06.321 --> 01:12:07.790
WE'VE WE PASSED THE ORDINANCE

01:12:07.856 --> 01:12:11.660
TO. COMPEL EVERY RESIDENT IN

01:12:11.727 --> 01:12:12.728
THE COUNTY OF NAPA AND SADDAM

AND AS OTHERS HAVE. TO BELONG

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:21.103
TO A CCA. IT'S NOT OPT OUT YEAH

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:22.204
IT IS OPT OUT SO EVERYBODY IS

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:23.672
IN THE PROGRAM SO PRESUMABLY

01:12:23.739 --> 01:12:25.207
THERE GETTING CLEAN ENERGY

01:12:25.274 --> 01:12:27.009
ALREADY. AND THEN ON TOP OF

01:12:27.076 --> 01:12:29.211
THAT WERE FOR SEE THESE PEOPLE

01:12:29.278 --> 01:12:31.213
TO PUT IN SOLAR IN THEIR HOMES

01:12:31.280 --> 01:12:34.483
THIS IS A POLICY GONE AWRY I

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.984
CAN UNDERSTAND THE POLICY ABOUT

01:12:36.051 --> 01:12:38.053
WANTING SO WE'RE- BUT IN THE

01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:38.687
AREAS WHERE WE'RE ALREADY DOING

01:12:38.754 --> 01:12:41.223
CCA'S. I THINK WE GET A RE

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.925
THINK YOUR WHAT WE'RE DOING

01:12:42.991 --> 01:12:45.127
HERE BUT MOREOVER MY BIG

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.563
CONCERN IS US TELLING

01:12:47.629 --> 01:12:49.098
HOMEOWNERS IT'S HOMES HAVE JUST

01:12:49.164 --> 01:12:51.233
BURNED TO THE GROUND THEY'VE

01:12:51.300 --> 01:12:52.468
GOT NOTHING THEY'RE NOT COULD

01:12:52.534 --> 01:12:54.336
BE ABLE TO READ THEIR- BRIE

01:12:54.403 --> 01:12:57.372
BUILD THEIR HOMES. AND WERE

01:12:57.439 --> 01:12:57.906
TELLING HIM WHAT THE BEST

01:12:57.973 --> 01:13:00.375
INVESTMENT IS FOR THEM. WE'RE

01:13:00.442 --> 01:13:01.176
TELLING THEM OF THE LEGISLATURE

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:01.977
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU REALLY DON'T

01:13:02.044 --> 01:13:03.545
KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

01:13:03.612 --> 01:13:04.980
I'M TELLING YOU RIGHT NOW THE

01:13:05.047 --> 01:13:06.849
BETTER INVESTMENT IS FOR YOU TO

01:13:06.915 --> 01:13:08.650
SPEND ANOTHER FORTY THOUSAND

01:13:08.717 --> 01:13:09.818
DOLLARS. ON YOUR HOME TO PUT

01:13:09.885 --> 01:13:11.987
SOLAR AND MEMBERS THIS IS

01:13:12.054 --> 01:13:13.322
RIDICULOUS I ASK FOR IN. A YES

01:13:13.388 --> 01:13:18.961
VOTE. SENATOR SKINNER. HI THIS

01:13:19.027 --> 01:13:21.830
IS JUST STUPID THINGS YOU.

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:27.636
SENATOR SKINNER. I HADN'T

01:13:27.703 --> 01:13:29.138
PLANNED ON JOINING THIS DEBATE

01:13:29.204 --> 01:13:30.739
BUT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR

01:13:30.806 --> 01:13:34.576
US TO WORK WERE SORT OF.

01:13:34.643 --> 01:13:37.079
CONFLATING THINGS OR OR PUTTING

01:13:37.146 --> 01:13:37.646
THINGS TOGETHER THAT AREN'T

01:13:37.713 --> 01:13:40.582
REALLY PUT TOGETHER FOR EXAMPLE.

01:13:40.649 --> 01:13:43.752
A HOME SOLAR INSTALLATION IS

01:13:43.819 --> 01:13:46.889
NOT NECESSARILY SOMETHING THAT

01:13:46.955 --> 01:13:51.627
WE A QUAKED WITH. ACHIEVING OUR

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:54.396
GREED WIDE RENEWABLE GOALS A

01:13:54.463 --> 01:13:56.365
HOME SOLAR INSTALLATION IS

01:13:56.431 --> 01:13:58.333
REALLY MUCH MORE LIKE ENERGY

01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:01.103
EFFICIENCY IT ALLOWS THAT HOME

01:14:01.170 --> 01:14:04.406
TO DEAL WITH ITS ELECTRICITY

01:14:04.473 --> 01:14:07.376
COSTS. AND JUST LIKE EFFICIENCY

01:14:07.442 --> 01:14:11.680
MEASURES IT GREATLY REDUCES THE

01:14:11.747 --> 01:14:14.550
NEED FOR DEPENDENCE ON

01:14:14.616 --> 01:14:18.253
GENERATION EXTERNALLY. SO I

01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:19.555
THINK THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT

01:14:19.621 --> 01:14:21.623
FACTOR TO THINK ABOUT AND NOT

01:14:21.690 --> 01:14:23.525
TO INTEGRATE IT WITH THE FACT

01:14:23.592 --> 01:14:25.194
THAT GRID WIDE WE MAY BE.

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:28.931
PRODUCING FOR MORE THAN ENOUGH

01:14:28.997 --> 01:14:33.535
SOLAR RESOURCE. WHICH WE I'LL

01:14:33.602 --> 01:14:35.270
ALL OF WE CAN DISCUSS ANOTHER

01:14:35.337 --> 01:14:37.072
TIME ALL THE DIFFERENT WAYS WE

01:14:37.139 --> 01:14:37.973
COULD USE THAT STROLLER

01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:40.609
RESOURCE AND THAT OUR AGENCIES

01:14:40.676 --> 01:14:42.444
ARE ACTUALLY PLANNING FOR BUT

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:43.745
THE FIRST THING I JUST WANT TO

01:14:43.812 --> 01:14:45.514
POINT OUT IS THAT TO CONFLATE

01:14:45.581 --> 01:14:47.416
IT WITH THE GRID WIDE RESOURCES

01:14:47.482 --> 01:14:49.651
NOT APPROPRIATE. SECONDARILY ON

01:14:49.718 --> 01:14:53.355
THE MORTGAGE ISSUE. THOSE OF US

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.656
WHO HAVE EITHER RE FIGHTER

01:14:54.723 --> 01:14:56.925
HOMES OR GOTTEN ALONE RECENTLY

01:14:56.992 --> 01:15:00.863
FOR OUR HOMES WE KNOW THAT. B.

01:15:00.929 --> 01:15:02.064
ONE OF THE THINGS THE LANDER

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.165
FACTORS IS WHAT ARE YOUR

01:15:03.232 --> 01:15:05.801
MONTHLY COSTS AND WHAT YOUR

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:06.935
INCOMING CAN YOU COVER THOSE

01:15:07.002 --> 01:15:09.204
MONTHLY COSTS. IN THE FACT THAT

01:15:09.271 --> 01:15:12.507
YOU HAVE A SOLAR SYSTEM REDUCES

01:15:12.574 --> 01:15:14.743
YOUR MONTHLY COSTS SOME OF THE

01:15:14.810 --> 01:15:18.247
US IN THE WHEN THE FORMULATION.

01:15:18.313 --> 01:15:18.814
OF WHAT IT IS YOU CAN AFFORD

01:15:18.881 --> 01:15:20.782
FOR A LOAN. YOU CAN AFFORD A

01:15:20.849 --> 01:15:24.519
LARGER LOAN. AND THIS IS A

01:15:24.586 --> 01:15:27.556
STANDARD PRACTICE OF LENDERS IN

01:15:27.623 --> 01:15:29.091
CALIFORNIA AND I KNOW THAT

01:15:29.157 --> 01:15:30.759
BECAUSE I HAVE NOT ONLY

01:15:30.826 --> 01:15:32.527
PURCHASED A HOUSE WITH THE

01:15:32.594 --> 01:15:33.061
SOLAR SYSTEM BUT I ALSO RE

01:15:33.128 --> 01:15:35.230
FIGHT IT. AND THE LENDER. WE

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:37.199
WAS FIFTH AFTER THOSE QUESTIONS

01:15:37.266 --> 01:15:38.467
AND THEY WERE ASKED THEY WERE

01:15:38.533 --> 01:15:40.002
ASKED IN THE- QUESTIONNAIRE

01:15:40.068 --> 01:15:44.172
THAT I HAD TO PREPARE. FINALLY

01:15:44.239 --> 01:15:45.307
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:49.244
TO REALIZE THAT SOLAR SYSTEMS

01:15:49.311 --> 01:15:52.581
OUR FORM OF HOME HARDENING. NO

01:15:52.648 --> 01:15:53.949
CERTAINLY SOLAR SYSTEM DOES NOT

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:56.618
PREVENT THE HOUSE FROM BEING

01:15:56.685 --> 01:15:58.720
FROM GOING INTO FLAMES WHEN WE

01:15:58.787 --> 01:15:59.988
HAVE A CONFLAGRATION AS WE'VE

01:16:00.055 --> 01:16:01.990
HAD IN THE TUBS FIRE IN

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.525
PARADISE BUT- WHEN WE DE

01:16:03.592 --> 01:16:06.295
COMMISSION OUR GRID TO PREVENT

01:16:06.361 --> 01:16:11.133
A FIRE. THAT SYSTEM WHICH NOW

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:14.703
COMMONLY IS COMBINED WITH.

01:16:14.770 --> 01:16:17.239
STORAGE ALLOWS THAT FACILITY TO

01:16:17.306 --> 01:16:22.244
STILL HAVE ELECTRICITY. WHICH

01:16:22.311 --> 01:16:24.680
AS OUR POPULATION IS OLDER AND

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.281
MORE OF US WILL BE POTENTIALLY

01:16:26.348 --> 01:16:28.951
RELYING ON THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:16:29.017 --> 01:16:30.185
TO PLUG IN TO KEEP US ALIVE

01:16:30.252 --> 01:16:32.254
WE'RE GOING TO WANT THAT AND

01:16:32.321 --> 01:16:33.922
WHAT WE'RE SEEING NOW IS MORE

01:16:33.989 --> 01:16:35.424
AND MORE OWNERS BUYING DIESEL

01:16:35.490 --> 01:16:37.459
GENERATORS. OUR MIND IS THAT

01:16:37.526 --> 01:16:41.763
DIESEL. POLLUTION IS ONE OF THE

01:16:41.830 --> 01:16:43.832
MOST HEALTH HARMING POLLUTION'S

01:16:43.899 --> 01:16:45.934
THAT WE HAVE IN OUR STATE WE DO

01:16:46.001 --> 01:16:48.637
NOT NEED TO SEND A MESSAGE TO

01:16:48.704 --> 01:16:51.173
BUY MORE DIESEL GENERATORS SO

01:16:51.239 --> 01:16:52.274
WHILE I APPRECIATE THE

01:16:52.341 --> 01:16:53.575
MOTIVATION OF. TRYING TO ASSIST

01:16:53.642 --> 01:16:57.579
OUR. OWNERS THAT HAVE LOST

01:16:57.646 --> 01:16:59.848
THEIR HOMES I DON'T THINK THIS

01:16:59.915 --> 01:17:01.650
IS AN APPROPRIATE FIX IT ALSO

01:17:01.717 --> 01:17:05.020
DOES NOT ADDRESS. THE PROBLEM

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:08.724
OF WHAT OUR INSURANCE. INDUSTRY

01:17:08.790 --> 01:17:11.760
IS DOING TO OUR HOMEOWNERS

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:12.928
WHICH IS A SEPARATE ISSUE WHICH

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:15.464
I KNOW ALL OF US WANT TO ENGAGE

01:17:15.530 --> 01:17:17.366
IN AND TRY TO ADDRESS BECAUSE

01:17:17.432 --> 01:17:19.368
WE KNOW THE THREAT TO HOME

01:17:19.434 --> 01:17:21.737
OWNERSHIP IF YOU CANNOT GET

01:17:21.803 --> 01:17:23.739
INSURANCE FOR YOUR HOME. SO

01:17:23.805 --> 01:17:24.339
WITH THAT I WOULD ASK FOR A NO

01:17:24.406 --> 01:17:32.147
VOTE. SENATOR GLACIER. THANK

01:17:32.214 --> 01:17:33.281
YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS

01:17:33.348 --> 01:17:35.317
AYE AYE I JOIN IN APPRECIATING

01:17:35.384 --> 01:17:36.718
THE THOUGHTFUL DISCUSSION HERE

01:17:36.785 --> 01:17:38.086
TODAY ON THIS ISSUE AND I KNOW

01:17:38.153 --> 01:17:40.288
THAT FOR OR AGAINST THIS

01:17:40.355 --> 01:17:41.923
MEASURE THAT TO ALL OF US ARE

01:17:41.990 --> 01:17:43.925
BIG PROPONENTS OF SOLAR ENERGY

01:17:43.992 --> 01:17:46.862
AND CLEAN CLEAN ENERGY BUT I

01:17:46.928 --> 01:17:48.397
THINK THE ONE OF THE PROBLEMS

01:17:48.463 --> 01:17:49.631
THAT WE ENCOUNTER ON THIS FLOOR

01:17:49.698 --> 01:17:51.867
QUITE OFTEN IS THE VIEW THAT A

01:17:51.933 --> 01:17:53.702
ONE SIZE FITS ALL FOR ALL OF

01:17:53.769 --> 01:17:54.302
US. FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE AND

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:57.172
OUR STATE. AND YOU KNOW IT.

01:17:57.239 --> 01:17:58.874
HAVE A SOME OF US HAVE HAD THE

01:17:58.940 --> 01:18:00.108
OPPORTUNITY TO GO UP TO

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:00.675
PARADISE SEE THIS INCREDIBLE

01:18:00.742 --> 01:18:01.243
DESTRUCTION. THAT OCCURRED

01:18:01.309 --> 01:18:05.113
THERE AND ONE OF THE THINGS

01:18:05.180 --> 01:18:08.850
THAT YOU SEE QUITE CLEARLY. AS

01:18:08.917 --> 01:18:09.418
YOU TRAVEL THROUGH THAT THAT

01:18:09.484 --> 01:18:13.088
DEVASTATED TOWN IS THAT. SOME

01:18:13.155 --> 01:18:13.655
HOMES SURVIVE IN SOME HOMES

01:18:13.722 --> 01:18:15.390
DIDN'T BUT IT'S A HEAVILY

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:21.363
FORESTED AREA. AND THAT THE

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.364
VIEW IS IF WE WERE SELLING

01:18:22.431 --> 01:18:24.032
SOLAR HERE ON THE FLOOR OF

01:18:24.099 --> 01:18:27.102
HOUSE SOMETHING PAYS FOR ITSELF.

01:18:27.169 --> 01:18:27.669
WELL THERE'S GENERALIZATIONS

01:18:27.736 --> 01:18:29.204
WITHIN THAT CATEGORY IT'S

01:18:29.271 --> 01:18:32.140
SIMPLY A GENERALIZATION. AND IF

01:18:32.207 --> 01:18:34.810
YOU HAVE A HOUSE IN PARADISE

01:18:34.876 --> 01:18:36.711
THAT HAS BEEN BURNED DOWN BUT

01:18:36.778 --> 01:18:37.312
IT'S STILL SURROUNDED HEAVILY

01:18:37.379 --> 01:18:40.115
SURROUNDED BY FORESTED LAND. I

01:18:40.182 --> 01:18:40.649
DON'T THINK YEAH IF YOU'RE

01:18:40.715 --> 01:18:43.618
SELLING THAT PERSON SOLAR. THAT

01:18:43.685 --> 01:18:45.787
DOESN'T GET THE LIGHT OF DAY ON

01:18:45.854 --> 01:18:46.421
THEIR HOME VERY OFTEN THAT THAT

01:18:46.488 --> 01:18:49.157
GENERALIZATION REALLY APPLY.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.325
AND SO I THINK THAT THAT'S A

01:18:50.392 --> 01:18:54.529
CHALLENGE FOR US OFTEN HERE. IS

01:18:54.596 --> 01:18:55.831

OF SOLAR THERE'S GREAT

01:19:00.502 --> 01:19:01.770
ARGUMENTS FOR IT. BUT THESE ARE

01:19:01.837 --> 01:19:05.474
PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN HEARD.

01:19:05.540 --> 01:19:06.141
AND THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT HAVE

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.076
UNIQUE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT THEY

01:19:08.143 --> 01:19:09.611
DESERVE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT

01:19:09.678 --> 01:19:10.879
ABOUT WHETHER THIS IS RIGHT FOR

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:13.448
THEM WITH THE COST UP FRONT CAN

01:19:13.515 --> 01:19:15.150
BE BORNE OUT BY THE BENEFITS

01:19:15.217 --> 01:19:16.985
LONG TERM WHETHER IT'S IN A

01:19:17.052 --> 01:19:19.054
LOWER UTILITY BILL OR WHAT HAVE

TIME OF NEED A BE SUPPORTIVE OF

01:19:23.758 --> 01:19:24.292
THAT CHOICE AND THAT'S WHY I'M

THAT IT IS THE FUTURE. AND I

01:19:56.291 --> 01:19:59.628

OF MY GOOD FRIEND FROM NAPA AND

01:20:02.797 --> 01:20:04.466
IN OTHERS INDICATE WE HAVE TO

01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:07.068
LOOK AT THE HUMAN PART OF THIS.

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:07.602
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW MANY

01:20:07.669 --> 01:20:10.005
PEOPLE I KNOW. WHO CANNOT

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:14.242
REBUILD THEIR HOMES. OR ARE

01:20:14.309 --> 01:20:15.710
STILL A YEAR AND A HALF LATER

01:20:15.777 --> 01:20:18.313
NOT TRUST A WILDFIRE BUT A

01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.915
SUBSEQUENT DEBRIS FLOW WHICH

01:20:19.981 --> 01:20:23.418
WAS INDEED A NATURAL DISASTER

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:23.919
THE TOOK OUT 10% OF THE

01:20:23.985 --> 01:20:24.553
COMMUNITY OF MONT TO SEED. THE

01:20:24.619 --> 01:20:29.024
KILL TWENTY THREE P. I LOW END

01:20:29.090 --> 01:20:30.358
AND IT'S AN AREA I DRIVE

01:20:30.425 --> 01:20:31.560
THROUGH EVERY TIME I COME HOME

01:20:31.626 --> 01:20:33.995
FROM SACRAMENTO I AM REMINDED

01:20:34.062 --> 01:20:36.131
OF IT CONSTANTLY AND I

01:20:36.198 --> 01:20:37.933
PERSONALLY DID NOT SUFFER BUT I

01:20:37.999 --> 01:20:40.202
CAN'T TELL YOU. THE EMOTIONAL.

01:20:40.268 --> 01:20:42.103
TRAUMA ASSOCIATED WITH THAT

01:20:42.170 --> 01:20:44.673
EXPERIENCE LET ALONE TRYING TO

01:20:44.739 --> 01:20:45.273
FIGURE OUT IF YOU CAN REBUILD

01:20:45.340 --> 01:20:48.877
YOUR HOME. AND IF THE INSURANCE

01:20:48.944 --> 01:20:49.444
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET IS

01:20:49.511 --> 01:20:51.346
EVEN ADEQUATE TO DO THE ACT.

01:20:51.413 --> 01:20:51.947
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE ARE UNDER

01:20:52.013 --> 01:20:55.383
INSURED. THE DISCUSSION WE'RE

01:20:55.450 --> 01:20:57.586
HAVING ABOUT OTHER ASPECTS OF

01:20:57.652 --> 01:20:59.454
THE WILDFIRES IN CLIMATE CHANGE

01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:01.223
AND ITS IMPACT IN THE STATE ARE

01:21:01.289 --> 01:21:02.724
ALL VERY IMPORTANT AND VERY

01:21:02.791 --> 01:21:04.392
RELEVANT AND THOSE ARE

01:21:04.459 --> 01:21:05.794
DISCUSSIONS WHETHER IT'S ABOUT

01:21:05.860 --> 01:21:07.462
INSURANCE WHETHER IT'S ABOUT

01:21:07.529 --> 01:21:09.731
HOME HARDENING WHETHER IT'S

01:21:09.798 --> 01:21:10.966
ABOUT HOW WE DEVELOP OUR

01:21:11.032 --> 01:21:13.201
COMMUNITIES. PROACTIVELY IT

01:21:13.268 --> 01:21:14.869
RETRO EXPECTEDLY THOSE ARE

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:19.341
IMPORTANT DISCUSSIONS. BUT AS

01:21:19.407 --> 01:21:20.141
I'VE LISTENED TO THIS

01:21:20.208 --> 01:21:21.710
DISCUSSION I AM HEARING MY

01:21:21.776 --> 01:21:23.578
CONSTITUENTS MY FRIENDS WHO ARE

01:21:23.645 --> 01:21:25.580
ABSOLUTELY AGONIZING OVER WHERE

01:21:25.647 --> 01:21:28.149
THEY'RE GOING TO LIVE. WHETHER

01:21:28.216 --> 01:21:30.652
OR NOT THEY ARE GOING TO EVEN

01:21:30.719 --> 01:21:32.187
BE ABLE TO REBUILD SOME

01:21:32.254 --> 01:21:32.754
SEMBLANCE OF THE HOMES THAT

01:21:32.821 --> 01:21:37.058
THEY HAD. AND I AGREE THAT I

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.893
DON'T THINK WE CAN DECIDE HERE

01:21:38.960 --> 01:21:40.895
IN THIS LEGISLATURE WHAT THESE

01:21:40.962 --> 01:21:43.098
PEOPLE SHOULD BE DOING WE'RE

01:21:43.164 --> 01:21:45.667
NOT TALKING ABOUT A HUGE NUMBER

01:21:45.734 --> 01:21:47.969
OF HOMES EXCEPT IN PARADISE WE

01:21:48.036 --> 01:21:50.805
ARE TALKING ABOUT MANY HOMES. I

01:21:50.872 --> 01:21:51.406
DON'T BELIEVE THIS IS GOING TO

01:21:51.473 --> 01:21:54.342
UNDERMINE OUR SOLAR PROGRAM. IF

01:21:54.409 --> 01:21:56.778
WE IF WE OF PASSES LEGISLATION

01:21:56.845 --> 01:21:58.013
BUT I THINK WE HAVE TO

01:21:58.079 --> 01:21:59.614
RECOGNIZE THE HUMANITY OF THE

01:21:59.681 --> 01:22:01.216
PEOPLE WHO HAVE SUFFERED FROM

01:22:01.283 --> 01:22:02.884
THIS. AND THE NOTION OF AN

01:22:02.951 --> 01:22:04.953
ADDITIONAL WHETHER IT'S TEN

01:22:05.020 --> 01:22:06.588
THOUSAND DOLLARS OR FORTY

01:22:06.655 --> 01:22:07.722
THOUSAND DOLLARS BUT IN A FEW

01:22:07.789 --> 01:22:09.324
YEARS IT WILL SAVE THE MONEY.

01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.458
THAT'S NOT WHAT THEY'RE

01:22:10.525 --> 01:22:12.394
THINKING ABOUT NOW I THINK WE

01:22:12.460 --> 01:22:13.695
HAVE TO HELP THESE PEOPLE IN

01:22:13.762 --> 01:22:15.463
EVERY WAY WE CAN. TO TRY TO

01:22:15.530 --> 01:22:17.399
REBUILD THEIR LIVES AFTER THIS

01:22:17.465 --> 01:22:19.768
MOST TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THAT

01:22:19.834 --> 01:22:21.836
THEY HAVE SUFFERED AND SO IT IS

01:22:21.903 --> 01:22:23.872
BECAUSE OF THAT THAT I WILL BE

01:22:23.938 --> 01:22:25.607
SUPPORTING THIS BILL AND

01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.208
CONTINUE TO WORK MY WITH MY

01:22:27.275 --> 01:22:28.343
FRIENDS IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:22:28.410 --> 01:22:30.912
COMMUNITY. TO TRY TO DO MORE TO

01:22:30.979 --> 01:22:33.114
CREATE ALTERNATIVE ENERGY BUT

01:22:33.181 --> 01:22:36.217
THIS IS NOT THE BILL TO DO IT.

01:22:36.284 --> 01:22:36.818
AND WITH THAT I WOULD ASK YOUR

01:22:36.885 --> 01:22:43.758
AYE VOTE. SENATOR RICE OF.

01:22:43.825 --> 01:22:44.659
MADAM PRESIDENT OF FIRST OF ALL

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:46.695
I WANNA CLARIFY THAT MY INITIAL

01:22:46.761 --> 01:22:48.863
COMMENTS WERE SIMPLY TO ROAST

01:22:48.930 --> 01:22:49.664
SENATOR DOLLY BECAUSE THIS IS

01:22:49.731 --> 01:22:53.201
HIS FIRST BILL AS A CENTER AND

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:53.802
I CAN SEE HOW THAT WENT REALLY

01:22:53.868 --> 01:22:57.005
AWRY. AND I'D LIKE ALL THE

01:22:57.072 --> 01:22:59.174
GIANTS FOR THAT. BUT I'D LIKE

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:00.442
TO PUT ON THE RECORD MY

01:23:00.508 --> 01:23:01.843
COMMENTS RELATED TO THIS BILL

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:03.111
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S VERY

01:23:03.178 --> 01:23:04.946
IMPORTANT PEOPLE UNDERSTAND

01:23:05.013 --> 01:23:07.749
WHAT THIS BILL IS REALLY ABOUT

01:23:07.816 --> 01:23:09.517
AND WHY WE NEED TO PASS IT

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:13.288
TODAY. THIS BILL IS NOT GOING

01:23:13.355 --> 01:23:15.156
TO SLOW DOWN CALIFORNIA

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:18.193
ACHIEVING IN. ITS GOT GAS

01:23:18.259 --> 01:23:20.862
REDUCTION GOALS AND GREEN IN

01:23:20.929 --> 01:23:21.463
THE GRID THIS IS NOT THE BILL

01:23:21.529 --> 01:23:23.631
THAT WILL ACCOMPLISH THAT.

01:23:23.698 --> 01:23:25.934
SIMPLY SPEAKING IN RIGHT NOW

01:23:26.000 --> 01:23:28.036
THE URGENCY IS REPLACING THIS

01:23:28.103 --> 01:23:28.636
HOUSING GETTING PEOPLE BACK IN

01:23:28.703 --> 01:23:31.940
THEIR HOMES. AS THEIR HOMES

01:23:32.006 --> 01:23:34.175
WERE WHEN THEY LOST THEM AND IF

01:23:34.242 --> 01:23:38.012
THEY ELECT TO ADD SOLAR THROUGH

01:23:38.079 --> 01:23:39.247
THE CONSTRUCTION PROCESS LET

01:23:39.314 --> 01:23:41.116
THAT BE THEIR CHOICE BUT NOT

01:23:41.182 --> 01:23:42.884
LET USNOT MAKE IT MORE

01:23:42.951 --> 01:23:44.886
DIFFICULT AND GETTING THEM BACK

01:23:44.953 --> 01:23:47.155
INTO THEIR HOMES. MANY OF THESE

01:23:47.222 --> 01:23:48.189
FAMILIES WILL PROBABLY NOT

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:50.625
REBUILD THEIR HOMES MANY OF

01:23:50.692 --> 01:23:53.094
THEM WILL HAVE A HARD TIME.

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:55.430
GETTING THE FULL VALUE FROM THE

01:23:55.497 --> 01:23:57.766
INSURANCE COMPANIES OF THEIR

01:23:57.832 --> 01:23:58.900
HOME SO THEY CAN FULLY REPLACE

01:23:58.967 --> 01:24:01.169
THEM WITHOUT HAVING OUT OF

01:24:01.236 --> 01:24:03.938
POCKET COSTS IF A HOME DOESN'T

01:24:04.005 --> 01:24:07.075
HAVE SOLAR NOW YOU'RE HAVE AT

01:24:07.142 --> 01:24:07.675
IT BELIEVE ME THERE'S GOING TO

01:24:07.742 --> 01:24:09.444
BE A COST. AND THERE IS GONNA

01:24:09.511 --> 01:24:12.347
BE. PERMIT PROCESS TO DO THAT

01:24:12.414 --> 01:24:13.915
AND I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S

01:24:13.982 --> 01:24:15.383
FAIR THAT WE PUT THIS

01:24:15.450 --> 01:24:17.452
REQUIREMENT ON VICTIMS OF FIRES

01:24:17.519 --> 01:24:20.622
THIS IS A COMPASSIONATE BILL.

01:24:20.688 --> 01:24:23.124
YOUR POSITION TODAY IS WHETHER

01:24:23.191 --> 01:24:24.259
YOU HAVE COMPASSION FOR THESE

01:24:24.325 --> 01:24:27.495
PEOPLE THEY'RE SUFFERING OR NOT.

01:24:27.562 --> 01:24:28.630
THAT THAT I REALLY WHAT THIS

01:24:28.696 --> 01:24:30.632
MATTERS ABOUT MY HOPE AS A

01:24:30.698 --> 01:24:32.300
LEGISLATURE WE STAND BY THE

01:24:32.367 --> 01:24:33.701
VICTIMS AND WE DO EVERYTHING

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:36.471

WHO SUPPORTED THIS MEASURE AND

01:24:53.388 --> 01:24:54.989
I THINK THE BOTTOM LINE IS WE

01:24:55.056 --> 01:24:56.891
ARE TALKING ABOUT HUMAN BEINGS

01:24:56.958 --> 01:24:58.993

01:25:59.754 --> 01:26:02.056
PROBABLY. THE MOST GREEN COUNTY

01:26:02.123 --> 01:26:02.857
IN THE STATE IN IN RIVERSIDE

01:26:02.924 --> 01:26:05.460
COUNTY WE HAVE. GEOTHERMAL

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:06.060
ENERGY WE HAVE STORAGE WE HAVE

01:26:06.127 --> 01:26:11.132
SOLAR. WE DON'T HAVE HYDRO WE

01:26:11.199 --> 01:26:11.699
DON'T HAVE AND NEAR ANY BIG

01:26:11.766 --> 01:26:17.472
LAKES. I HELD MY HOME AND I'VE

01:26:17.539 --> 01:26:18.072
ONLY THREE ELECTRIC CARS I'VE

01:26:18.139 --> 01:26:22.210
DONE MY PART. TO GET THE STATE

01:26:22.277 --> 01:26:24.913
ON TRACK TO GETTING TO THE

01:26:24.979 --> 01:26:25.513
POINT WHERE WE REACH OUR GOALS

01:26:25.580 --> 01:26:26.881
AND I'M VERY PROUD ACTUALLY OF

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.249
THE STATE BECAUSE WE PROBABLY

01:26:28.316 --> 01:26:30.318
COME FURTHER TO UTILIZING

01:26:30.385 --> 01:26:31.719
ALTERNATIVE ENERGY GOOD CLEAN

01:26:31.786 --> 01:26:33.821
ENERGY THE PROBABLY ANY OTHER

01:26:33.888 --> 01:26:34.322
STATE OR MAYBE ANY OTHER

01:26:34.389 --> 01:26:38.826
COUNTRY. ON THE PLANET. BUT YOU

01:26:38.893 --> 01:26:40.128
KNOW OUR HOMES ARE OUR HEAVEN

01:26:40.194 --> 01:26:43.698
ON EARTH AND A LOT OF FOLKS

01:26:43.765 --> 01:26:46.401
LOST EVERYTHING NOT ONLY DID

01:26:46.467 --> 01:26:49.904
THEY LOSE THEIR HOMES. FOR MANY

01:26:49.971 --> 01:26:52.540
THEY LOST THEIR JOBS THEY LOST

01:26:52.607 --> 01:26:54.676
THEIR KIDS LOST THEIR SCHOOLS

01:26:54.742 --> 01:26:55.176
THEY HAD TO GO AND OTHER

01:26:55.243 --> 01:26:57.645
SCHOOLS AND HAVE THE TRAUMA OF

01:26:57.712 --> 01:26:58.279
YOU KNOW MAKING NEW FRIENDS ALL

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:02.150
OVER AGAIN. AND CERTAINLY BUT

01:27:02.216 --> 01:27:03.484
THE SHORTAGE OF HOUSING THAT WE

01:27:03.551 --> 01:27:04.752
HAVE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

01:27:04.819 --> 01:27:05.386
WE SEE IN THE COST OF MATERIALS

01:27:05.453 --> 01:27:08.122
RISE. WE PROBABLY DON'T HAVE

01:27:08.189 --> 01:27:09.324
ENOUGH CONTRACTORS TO QUICKLY

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:09.924
BUILD ALL THE HOMES THAT WERE

01:27:09.991 --> 01:27:12.026
LOST. SO MANY OF A SHORTAGE OF

01:27:12.093 --> 01:27:16.297
THINGS OF COURSE COSTS INCREASE.

01:27:16.364 --> 01:27:17.899
AND I CAN TELL YOU THAT FOR

01:27:17.966 --> 01:27:19.534
SOME OF YOU MAY BE YOUR HOBBIES

01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:20.969
OR GOLF OR TENNIS MY HOBBY

01:27:21.035 --> 01:27:23.237
ACTUALLY IS REAL ESTATE I BUY A

01:27:23.304 --> 01:27:23.871
LOT OF REAL ESTATE. I SAW A LOT

01:27:23.938 --> 01:27:26.507
OF REAL ESTATE. AND I CAN TELL

01:27:26.574 --> 01:27:27.208
YOU THAT. PUTTING PANELS ON A

01:27:27.275 --> 01:27:32.814
HOME. IS A UP FRONT COST.

01:27:32.880 --> 01:27:35.049
PROSPECTIVELY IF YOU PUT PANELS

01:27:35.116 --> 01:27:36.384
ON YOU'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY

01:27:36.451 --> 01:27:38.419
AND MAYBE EVEN REDUCING THE

01:27:38.486 --> 01:27:39.053
COST OF THOSE SOLAR PANELS OVER

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:41.122
TEN OR FIFTEEN YEARS. BUT TODAY

01:27:41.189 --> 01:27:46.594
WHEN. MOST OF THESE VICTIMS ARE

01:27:46.661 --> 01:27:47.895
UNDER INSURED THEY HAVE TO FIND

01:27:47.962 --> 01:27:50.198
ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO. GET

01:27:50.264 --> 01:27:53.534
THEIR HOMES REBUILT AGAIN. AND

01:27:53.601 --> 01:27:55.069
THE BANKS ARE NOT GOING TO MAKE

01:27:55.136 --> 01:27:56.804
A DECISION ON WHETHER OR NOT

01:27:56.871 --> 01:27:58.606
THERE UTILITY PRICES ARE GOING

01:27:58.673 --> 01:27:59.941
TO BE A LITTLE BIT LESS IN THE

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:00.441
FUTURE. THEY'RE GONNA BE

01:28:00.508 --> 01:28:02.710
LOOKING AT YOUR INCOME. AND

01:28:02.777 --> 01:28:03.811
YOUR INCOME MATCH WHAT YOUR

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:04.779
EXPENSES ARE GOING TO BE WITH

01:28:04.846 --> 01:28:06.314
RESPECT YOUR MORTGAGE ON YOUR

01:28:06.381 --> 01:28:08.583
NEW. HOME THAT IS GOING TO BE

01:28:08.650 --> 01:28:12.887
THE DETERMINING FACTOR. SO I

01:28:12.954 --> 01:28:13.955
ALSO DON'T GET A LOT OF

01:28:14.022 --> 01:28:16.257

01:49:41.574 --> 01:49:43.410
A CONTINUING ESCALATION. OF

NONSENSE. AND IT CERTAINLY IS

01:49:58.858 --> 01:50:02.362
NOT HOW WE DO. THE BUSINESS OF

01:50:02.429 --> 01:50:05.665
GOVERNMENT IN THE UNITED STATES.

01:50:05.732 --> 01:50:06.299
AND THIS PHENOMENA HAS AFFECTED

01:50:06.366 --> 01:50:09.703
THE WHOLE NATION. IN OUR

01:50:09.769 --> 01:50:11.137

THEY ARE. THEY'RE EVEN ASHAMED

01:50:26.786 --> 01:50:30.357
TO SHOW THEIR FACES. SO HOW

01:50:30.423 --> 01:50:31.458
CONVICTED ARE THEY TO THEIR

01:50:31.524 --> 01:50:35.028
PASSION WHATEVER THAT MAY BE.

01:50:35.095 --> 01:50:36.429
BUT IF WE AS A SOCIETY AS
