INTRODUCED BILLS- MY FIRST YEAR

00:33:54.265 --> 00:33:57.168
REGARDING C. ESPECIALLY TO PLAY

00:33:57.235 --> 00:33:57.635
INSTEAD TO HOUSING AND

00:33:57.702 --> 00:33:59.604
STREAMLINING. BUT I GOTTA SAY

00:33:59.670 --> 00:34:02.039
EVEN THOUGH WE ARE. WE'RE

00:34:02.106 --> 00:34:04.041
DEALING WITH- THE PANDEMIC AND

00:34:04.108 --> 00:34:06.077
IT WILL NO DOUBT. TAKE ALL OF

00:34:06.144 --> 00:34:08.179
THIS LEGISLATIVE CYCLE. I AM

00:34:08.246 --> 00:34:11.048
HOPEFUL THAT WE HAVE THE

00:34:11.115 --> 00:34:14.519
COURAGE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE.

00:34:14.585 --> 00:34:17.221
ON ITS MERITS IN THE YEAR

00:34:17.288 --> 00:34:19.223
TWENTY TWO. BECAUSE I SUPPORT

THIS MEASURE I'M GONNA VOTE FOR

00:34:20.892 --> 00:34:24.362
TODAY. BUT THE FACT THAT WE ARE

00:34:24.429 --> 00:34:26.097
STREAMLINING SEQUEL FOR

00:34:26.164 --> 00:34:28.833
PRIORITY PROJECTS UNDERLIES THE

00:34:28.900 --> 00:34:32.303
FACT THAT SEQUEL IS NOT WORKING

00:34:32.370 --> 00:34:34.639
THE WAY IT WAS INTENDED. AND I

00:34:34.705 --> 00:34:37.041
THINK IT WE HAD OF THE BODY WE

00:34:37.108 --> 00:34:38.776
HAVE TO HAVE THE COURAGE TO

00:34:38.843 --> 00:34:41.412
TACKLE THIS ISSUE. DESPITE THE

00:34:41.479 --> 00:34:42.547
SPECIAL INTERESTS IN THE

00:34:42.613 --> 00:34:44.449
PREVAILING POLITICAL WINDS OF

00:34:44.515 --> 00:34:47.185
THE TIME. WE CAN'T SIMPLY

SIDELINED SPECIAL PROJECTS AND

00:34:49.687 --> 00:34:52.723
CERTAIN NEEDS- TO DIVERT AROUND

00:34:52.790 --> 00:34:54.759
THIS CUMBERSOME PROCESS WHICH

00:34:54.826 --> 00:34:56.727
CLEARLY IS NOT DELIVERING WHAT

00:34:56.794 --> 00:34:58.896
WE NEED. ALL WITH THAT I WILL

00:34:58.963 --> 00:35:00.631
BE SUPPORTING THIS BECAUSE IT

00:35:00.698 --> 00:35:01.799
IS ESSENTIAL THAT WE MOVE

00:35:01.866 --> 00:35:03.668
FORWARD ON THESE THINGS. BUT

00:35:03.734 --> 00:35:05.870
IT'S EVEN MORE ESSENTIAL- THAT

00:35:05.937 --> 00:35:07.672
