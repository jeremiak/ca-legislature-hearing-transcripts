ASSEMBLY HIGHER EDUCATION COMMITTEE IS CALLED TO ORDER AND WE WILL START AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. AND THE FIRST ITEM. FIRST ITEM WILL BE. FILE ITEM ONE. OH OKAY GOOD AFTERNOON PLEASE NOTE THAT FILE ITEM ONE A. B. EIGHT NINETY SIX. HAS BEEN PULLED. WITH THE CONSENT OF THE AUTHOR. ALSO NOTE THAT OUR GUIDANCE FOR BILLS HEARD THIS AND COMMITTEE TODAY IS TO ALLOW TESTIMONY. FROM TWO WITNESSES FOR SUPPORT AND TWO WITNESSES FOR OPPOSITION. SPEAK FOR TWO MINUTES EACH. I WILL ALSO CALLED FOR TWEETERS TESTIMONY THOSE WHO ARE NEITHER IN SUPPORT. OR OPPOSE TO A MEASURE. AND THEN THE. CORRECT. FILE ITEM ONE WAS PULLED OUT FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR. AND WE WILL GO TO THE FIRST BILL MISS CUT BY YET. WHICH IS FILE ITEM NINE. WELL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR. WHICH WOULD CREATE THE EMERGENCY STUDENT HOUSING LOAN PROGRAM A PILOT PROGRAM AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. TO HELP HOMELESS STUDENTS OR STUDENTS AT RISK OF BECOMING HOMELESS TO SECURE HOUSING SO THEY CAN STAY IN SCHOOL. THE RISE IN THE COST OF LIVING HAS AFFECTED ALL CALIFORNIANS AND STUDENTS REALLY ARE NO EXCEPTION. A RECENT STUDY CONDUCTED BY THE CSU FOUND APPROXIMATELY ELEVEN PERCENT OF ITS STUDENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED HOMELESSNESS ONE OR MORE TIMES IN THE PAST TWELVE MONTHS. FIRST GENERATION AND STUDENTS OF COLOR FACE AN EVEN HIGHER RISK OF HOUSING IN SECURITY. AND EXPERIENCE HIGHER RATE OF HOMELESSNESS REPORTS OF STUDENTS SLEEPING IN CROWDED AND TINY APARTMENTS CARS SHELTERS AND STREETS ARE COMMON. FOR MOST STUDENTS HOUSING IS THEIR LARGEST EXPENSE WITH THE AVERAGE ANNUAL CSU TUITION AND FEES AMOUNTING TO OVER SEVEN THOUSAND DOLLARS AND THE AVERAGE ANNUAL HOUSING COST OVER THIRTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER AT. ANNUALLY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED THE HOMELESS PREVENTION AND RAPID RE HOUSING PROGRAM TO TACKLE HOMELESSNESS. RAPID RE HOUSING IS AN INTERVENTION MODEL TO RAPIDLY CONNECT FAMILIES AND INDIVIDUALS EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS TO PERMANENT HOUSING WALK WHILE CONNECTING THEM TO OTHER RESOURCES AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD TAILOR RAPID RE HOUSING TO THE CSU SYSTEM. ALLOWS ALLOWING THREE PARTICIPATING CAMPUSES TO PROVIDE LOANS TO ELIGIBLE STUDENTS. STUDENTS WHO LOSE HOUSING ARE MORE LIKELY TO OUR DROPPED OUT OF COLLEGE LEADING TO HIGHER RISK OF BECOMING CHRONICALLY HOMELESS FOR CALIFORNIA TO MEET ITS FUTURE SKILLED WORKFORCE NEEDS NEEDS TO SUPPORT THE MOST VULNERABLE MOBILE STUDENTS. ADDRESSING STUDENT HOMELESSNESS REQUIRES A MULTIFACETED APPROACH AND AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR IS A CRITICAL COMPONENT. HOUSING COSTS. IT WITH ME TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OUR JARED JERUSALEM WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND DOCTOR KIZI LOPEZ COORDINATOR OF THE RENAISSANCE SCHOLARS PROGRAM AT CSU FRESNO. MOVE THE BILL. BUT WE. BUT IT WAS. GOOD TAKE. TENANTS. YEAH NO SEVEN YEAH. YEAH. WE'LL GO AHEAD. WE'RE GONNA GO. WE'RE GONNA JUST STOP FOR A MINUTE TO. ESTABLISH SUPPORT. MEDINA PRESS BAKER. ARAMBULA. BLOOM CHAVEZ. IRWIN. KILEY LEVINE LOW PATTERSON QUIRK SILVA. SANTIAGO WEBER. SEE. OKAY ADVOCATE GOOD AFTERNOON. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MEDINA AND MEMBERS GET MY NAME IS GERRY JERVIS I REPRESENT BECAUSE IT'S AN ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING NEARLY HALF A MILLION I'M CSU STUDENTS STATEWIDE. WERE REALLY THANKFUL FOR LEADERSHIP ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE BY SOME REMEMBER CABALLERO I'M FOR YEARS AND HIGHER EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA WE'VE HEARD THE STORIES OF HOMELESS STUDENTS. IN BOTH CASES IT WITH AN INDIVIDUAL PROFILE HERE AND THERE OF THE SUIT STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. AS TIME PASSED WE'VE BECOME MORE MORE AWARE OF HOW PRESSING ISSUE THIS. ISSUE OF. HOMELESSNESS IS IN CALIFORNIA AND HOW THAT CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS HAS NOT. OF. ALLUDED SADDAM COLLEGE STUDENTS. THANK THE RESEARCH CONDUCTED BY CSU WE NOW KNOW SYSTEM MY NUMBERS. WITH RESPECT HOMELESSNESS ELEVEN PERCENT IF YOU IF YOU STUDENTS ARE HOMELESS THAT MEANS TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CSU STUDENTS DO NOT KNOW WHERE THEY'LL BE SLEEPING NIGHT TONIGHT HAVING TO FIND SHELTER SLEEPING IN THEIR CARS. OR BACKING A FRIENDS ALLOW THEM TO STAY WITH THEM FOR ANOTHER NIGHT WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY TRYING TO SUCCEED IN COLLEGE. ADDITIONALLY THIS PERCENTAGE AS THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER NOTED IS. MUCH HIGHER FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS IN FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS THAT I EIGHTEEN PERCENT OF HOMELESSNESS RATES. THIS IS WHY HAVING A TARGET AND PREVENT PROGRAM LIKE THE ONE OUTLINED IN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR IS SO CRITICAL TO SOLVING THIS ISSUE. AND PILOTING A PROGRAM LIKE THIS I'M IN THE CSU MAKES PERFECT SENSE. IF YOU IF YOU ADMINISTRATION IN THE INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES HAVE DEMONSTRATED A COMMITMENT TO SUPPORTING HOMELESS STUDENTS WITH EXTREMELY LIMITED RESOURCES WHETHER IT'S I'M STOPPING A SYSTEM WIDE OPPOSITION TO THE ANALYZE BASIC NEEDS. OR INDIVIDUAL CAMPUSES OFFERING EMERGENCY LOANS. EMERGENCY GRANTS I'M IN EVEN FINDING EMERGENCY HOUSING I'M HAVING. A SOLUTION LIKE THE ONE PRESENTED IN AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY FOUR WOULD JUST BE AN ADDITIONAL TOOLS IN THE TOOL KIT FOR A FOR CAMPUS IS LOOKING TO SUPPORT HOMELESS STUDENTS. WE BELIEVE CAL STATE SINCE. IS CELTICS IN ASSOCIATION BELIEVES THAT IF WE CAN SOLVE THE CRISIS OF HOMELESSNESS IN THE CSU WE CAN GO A LONG WAY TO HELPING SOLVE CHRONIC HOMELESSNESS ACROSS THE STATE. A COLLEGE EDUCATION AGREE YOU FROM THE CSU IN PARTICULAR HAS A PROVEN POSITIVE IMPACT ON AN INDIVIDUAL'S ABILITY TO HAVE UPWARD SOCIAL MOBILITY. COUPLE THAT WITH THE FACT THAT OVER HALF OF THIS UC'S POPULATION IS PALATABLE COMING FROM EXTREMELY LOW INCOME BACKGROUNDS THERE MAY BE NO GREATER LONG TERM WAY TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS STATEWIDE AND SUPPORTING OUR HOME WITH COLLEGE STUDENTS TODAY. THIS ISSUE IS HEARTBREAKING THE WITNESS STUDENTS ARE MERELY TRYING TO COMPLETE THEIR DEGREES SO THEY CAN BETTER THEMSELVES THEIR COMMUNITIES IN THE STATE. AND WE HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO CHOOSE TO SUPPORT OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS AND AND VOTE TO PASS A BETWEEN SEVENTY FOUR THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO THINK THAT COULD MAYBE AN ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COPPING ARROW IN AROUND THE LEFT FOR. CARRYING THIS BILL IT SO IMPORTANT MY NAME IS DOCTOR KIZI LOPEZ AND I SERVE AS THE COORDINATOR OF THE RENAISSANCE SCHOLARS PROGRAM AT FRESNO STATE. RENAISSANCE CALLER SERVES STUDENTS. WHO'VE EXPERIENCED FOSTER CARE OR UNACCOMPANIED HOMELESS YOUTH. I KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE HOMELESS WHILE IN COLLEGE. AND WHEN I STARTED COLLEGE I WAS HOMELESS FOR THE FIRST THREE MONTHS OF WITHOUT PARENTAL SUPPORT. I REMEMBER TRYING TO MAINTAIN MY BASIC HYGIENE ACROSS THE STREET AT TACO BELL. THAT RESTAURANT THAT WAS ACROSS THE STREET AT THE SCHOOL. AS YOU CAN IMAGINE I STRUGGLED ACADEMICALLY I'M A DOCTOR TODAY BUT YOU KNOW MY GRADES WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU THAT BACK THEN. I CANNOT FOCUS ON SCHOOL I'LL ALL I THOUGHT ABOUT WAS WHERE I WAS GOING TO SEE HOW IT'S GOING TO GET MY NEXT MEAL. AND IT HONESTLY WAS A VERY DARK TIME IN MY LIFE AND I HAD TO MAKE SOME REALLY TOUGH ETHICAL DECISIONS ABOUT HOW I WOULD SURVIVE. I I KNOW THAT THE FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE OUT FOR MY COLLEGE WOULD HAVE MADE A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE AND HELPING NEED MY BASIC MEANS. THAT WOULD ALLOW ME TO FOCUS IN SCHOOL BUT INSTEAD I STRUGGLED A MY CONFIDENCE WAS SHAKEN AND. IT TOOK ME ALMOST TEN YEARS TO GET A BACHELORS DEGREE OFTEN ON. ASSEMBLYMEMBER COPIER TALKED ABOUT THE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS OF PEOPLE WHO EXPERIENCE HOMELESSNESS IN COLLEGE A STUDENTS OF COLOR. ALSO A STUDENTS WHO'VE BEEN A PROSECUTOR EXTREMELY VULNERABLE AND SO SOMEONE LIKE ME AS A WOMAN OF COLOR LOW INCOME AND HAVE EXPERIENCE FOSTER CARE I WAS THAT VULNERABLE STUDENT. AND. MY STORY I'M VERY FORTUNATE AND VERY LUCKY BUT I THINK WE NEED TO CHANGE THE NARRATIVE I SHOULDN'T BE THE EXCEPTION. I HAVE DEDICATED MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE TO IMPROVING THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES OF FOSTER YOUTH AND HOMELESS YOU THINK COLLEGE BECAUSE OF MY OWN EXPERIENCES. I DO NOT WANT TO SEE STUDENTS MAKE THOSE DIFFICULT ETHICAL CHOICES I HAD TO MAKE JUST TO SURVIVE INSTEAD I WANT MY STUDENTS TO FOCUS ON SCHOOL AND BUILDING THEIR FEATURES. RENAISSANCE SCHOLARS IS ABLE TO SERVE SIXTY STUDENTS AT THE UNIVERSITY. BUT WE'VE HEARD STATEWIDE THERE'S ELEVEN PERCENT OF STUDENTS IN THIS ISSUE ARE EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS. I'M A LITTLE FINANCIAL SUPPORT CAN BE TRANSFORMATIVE IN THE LIVES OF THESE YOUNG PEOPLE I REMEMBER IT WAS THREE HUNDRED DOLLARS. BEST THAT. I NEED IT AND I COULDN'T GET AND I WAS HOMELESS. THEREFORE. I WANT TO STATE THAT AS A A FORMER HOMELESS STUDENT AND NOW PRACTITIONER SUPPORTING THIS POPULATION. I SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF THIS BILL AND I AM WANT TO PARTNER WITH YOU ALL INVESTING IN THESE VERY TALENTED. STUDENTS IN THE CSU THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. AFTERNOON TURNED MEMBERS A DROUGHT OF WELL THAT'S WHAT THE STEINBERG INSTITUTE HERE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. OF RAPID RE HOUSING IS A SUCCESSFUL INNOVATION AND SOCIAL POLICY THAT HAS BEEN PROVEN TO PREVENT HOMELESSNESS AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE BILL THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON ALEX GRAVES AT THE CSU CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OUR POSITIONS CURRENTLY PENDING BUT WE HOPE TO GET TO A SUPPORT POSITION IN THE VERY NEAR FUTURE WANT TO THANK THE MEMBER FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. OUT WE'RE VERY. CONCERNED ABOUT THIS ISSUE AND WORKING ACTIVELY ON OUR CAMPUSES ACROSS OUR SYSTEM TO ADDRESSES OF THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS SYLVIA SOLELY SHAUN BEHALF THE TWENTY THOUSAND FACULTY COUNSELORS LIBRARIANS AND COACHES OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION IN STRONG SUPPORT THINK. ANGELIQUE YORK WITH NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS ARE STRONG SUPPORT. CHRISTOPHER MARTIN WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA ALSO IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU. AND I I SAID I WOULD. ASTRID TWEENER SO ANY ANY BETWEEN HERS ON THIS BILL. NONE. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANYONE IN THE AUDIENCE WANTING TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE. COMMITTEE. DOCTOR RUMBLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANTED TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR TAKING THE TIME TO COME TO PRESENT STATE AND TO SPEAK TO OUR STUDENTS. IT WAS IMPORTANT FOR THOSE OF US WHO OFTENTIMES FEEL LIKE WE'RE NOT A. HAPPY SEAT AT THE TABLE TO BE HEARD AND I BELIEVE THAT THIS MEASURE THAT'S BEFORE US WILL HELP TO ADDRESS A CRITICAL PROBLEM THAT'S HAPPENING WITHIN TOO MANY OF OUR COMMUNITIES. BUT I ALSO WANTED TO FIGHT COULD TAKE A SECOND TO THANK DOCTOR LOPEZ. IT'S A. YOU KNOW WHEN WE HAD THIS. PRESS CONFERENCE TO HELP UNVEILED THIS BILL WE ACTUALLY STRUGGLE TO GET A STUDENT TO TELL THEIR STORY. AND DOCTOR LOPEZ STEPPED UP AND WAS ABLE TO. IT HIGHLIGHTS HOW. HARD IT IS FOR THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING WITHIN OUR COMMUNITY. TO HAVE A VOICE RIGHT NOW AND I JUST WANTED TO THANK YOU FOR BEING HERE TO SHARE THAT. LOOKING FORWARD TO SUPPORTERS. BECAUSE BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR M. ALSO THINK THE MEMBER FOR BRINGING THE BILL FOR A. I UNDERSTAND THERE'S THREE CAMPUSES AND THAT WON'T WILL BE. DETERMINED BY THE BOARD AND NOT BY THIS BODY AND I. GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL TODAY I'D BE VERY INTERESTED IN SEEING IF THERE WOULD BE ANY GUIDANCE AND HOPEFULLY CONSIDERATION BY THEM A LOOK IN THOSE AREAS WHERE THE HIGH COST OF HOUSING IS PARTICULARLY SEVERELY HI YOU KNOW I DON'T HAVE A. C. ISSUE IN MY DISTRICT BUT. THERE'S ONE IN SAN JOSE WHICH IS RIGHT IN THE HEART OF SILICON VALLEY. STUDENTS AND FAMILIES GO THERE AND. YOU KNOW HOUSING IS OBVIOUSLY AN ISSUE IN THE BAY AREA. AS WELL AS THAT CAL STATE EAST BAY. AND AND HEAVY CONSIDERATION FOR WHERE THERE'S THREE CAMPUSES ARE AT LEAST ONE OF THEM. BEING IN AN AREA THAT IS. PARTICULARLY IMPACTED BY EXORBITANTLY HIGH HOUSING AND I'M SURE SOMEBODY COULD POINT OUT THAT THERE'S LOTS OF PLACES IN CALIFORNIA THAT HAVE THAT ISSUE. BUT I THINK IT'S IT'S SEVERE FOR STUDENTS WHEN THEY'RE LIVING IN ONE OF THE MOST EXPENSIVE. AREAS IN THE COUNTRY. AT HOPE THAT CAN BE A CONSIDERATION OR GUIDANCE GIVEN THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE CAN DO THAT RIGHT I DON'T THINK IT NEEDS TO BE IN THE BILL BUT I. WANNA GET THAT OUT THERE THAT SUPPORT FOR THAT TO BE. PART OF THE CONVERSATION. AND I'D LIKE THAT THIS IS A PILOT WE NEED TO SEE IF THIS IS GOING TO WORK AT THIS IS THE BEST WAY TO PUT THESE DOLLARS THERE'S LOTS OF WAYS TO HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE FACING HOUSING CRISIS AND IF THIS IS THE BEST ONE TO DO IT. AND I APPRECIATE THEM. THE PILOT IS FAIRLY NARROW IN TIME BECAUSE A SUNSET IS JUST A FEW YEARS HUESO THANK YOU FOR DOING THAT AND I'M JUST KID SEEN ON WHERE THEY PICK THOSE THREE CAMPUSES. NOT SEEN ANY OTHER COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS BY THE COMMITTEE I WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THIS GOVERNOR. PHAM APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS I'M AT WE'VE SPECIFICALLY LEFT IT OPEN IN TERMS OF THE THREE CAMPUSES MY GUESS IS IT'S GOING TO BE DIFFICULT. TO DECIDE BECAUSE THEIR CAMPUSES ARE ALL VERY DIFFERENT AND HAVE DIFFERENT RESOURCES LOCATED WITHIN A. THE DISTANCE ON THAT FACT THAT SOME ARE BRAND NEW AND HAVE VERY LITTLE HOUSING IN SUMMER REALLY. MUCH OLDER BUT HAVE GROWN. THAT. CITIES HAVE GROWN UP AROUND THE MAKE IT. AT IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE BUT I UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT I THINK. MOST OF CALIFORNIA. IS IN A CRITICAL STE STAGE OF HOUSING AFFORD OR LACK OF AFFORDABILITY AND SO. I DON'T THINK THIS IS GOING TO BE AN EASY CHOICE BUT WE NEED SOME REALLY GOOD MODELS TO TELL US WHETHER THIS WORKS AND WHETHER THERE ARE SOME THINGS WE OUGHT TO BE DOING DIFFERENTLY. THAT WILL HELP STUDENTS FIND HOUSING AROUND THE CAMPUSES. I ALSO WANNA. I THINK DR POT LOPEZ FOR COMING AND FOR SHARING HER STORY AND I THINK PART OF THE CHALLENGE THAT WE FOUND. IN FRESNO IS THAT STUDENTS ARE SO EMBARRASSED TO BE HOMELESS THAT THEY JUST DON'T WANT TO COME FORWARD AND SO I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO ADMIT. TO HAVE BEEN IN TO HAVE BEEN IN THAT SITUATION AND I APPRECIATE HER. DOCTOR LOW PRICES ON. IT EXPERIENCE AND HER WILLINGNESS TO SHARE IT WITH US IT THAT THAT MAKES IT SOUND SO POWERFUL. AND ALSO I THINK MR MR EACH YEAR IS THOUGH FOR FOR COMING ALL THIS WAY AS WELL THIS IS A CRITICAL. IN IN MY REGION IT CSU AND BE ITS MARI BAY. AT CSU AND I'M EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE AND PEOPLE ARE THAT STUDENTS ARE LIVING IN THEIR CARS AND I I CANNOT IMAGINE WHAT IT'S LIKE. TO TRY TO GO TO COLLEGE WHICH WAS DIFFICULT ENOUGH. AN NBA HOMELESS AND SO THE MORE THAT WE CAN CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR STUDENTS TO. BE ABLE TO BE SUCCESSFUL AND WE KNOW THAT WE NEED A MILLION. DEGREES OF AT STUDENTS WITH THE GREASE. WITHIN A VERY SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THESE ARE THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE COMMITTED THEMSELVES TO GET THERE AND SO WE NEED TO SUPPORT THEM SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR IBOOK. THANK YOU A MISCARRIAGE. I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD FROM THE STUDENTS THEMSELVES. IT FOR MY REPORTS IN THE MEDIA HOW ABOUT WHAT AN IMPORTANT ISSUE THIS IS OF HOMELESSNESS. AMONG STUDENTS SO I THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE THE BILL FORWARD AND I LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING HOW THE MODEL WORKS. TO ASSIST THE STUDENT POPULATION WE HAVE A MOTION BY. DR ARAMBULA AND A SECOND BY DOCTOR WEBER. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. MADAM SECRETARY CULTURAL. MEDINA AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. BAKER AYE ARAMBULA ARAMBULA AYE BLOOM. CHAVEZ IRWIN. IRWIN AYE KILEY LEVINE. LEVINE I. LOW. PATTERSON QUIRK SILVA. UIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO. SANTIAGO AYE WEBER. WEBER I. YOU VERY MUCH. EIGHT ZERO YOUR BILL IS OUT WILL KEEP IT OPEN FOR THE ABSENT MEMBERS THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. NEXT WE HAVE. MISTER BONTA. WHO HAS TWO BILLS? NOT HERE OKAY WILL GO NEXT TO MR WANT THIS THAT. WELCOME MR MONTHS. AND THAT'S I A ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX. ITEM ONE MAYBE GET. THANK YOU GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS EXISTING LAW PROVIDES A LEGAL PRIVILEGE OF CONFIDENTIAL COMMUNICATION BETWEEN A SURVIVOR OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. AND A SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX WOULD CLARIFY THAT THIS LEGAL PRIVILEGE APPLIES TO SEXUAL SAW COUNSELORS PROVIDING SERVICES AND SUPPORT. TO STUDENTS SURVIVORS AT A PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY WITH INCREASED ATTENTION TO THE ALARMING ISSUE OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OCCURRING AT OUR COLLEGE CAMPUSES THERE'S A NEED FOR INCREASED NUMBER OF SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS. TO PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE AN APPROPRIATE ASSISTANCE FOR SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. WITH ME TO TESTIFY ON BEHALF OF THE BILL IS DUE ALSO RAMIREZ WITH THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION WHOSE A SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AS WELL AS MY OUR BROMO VICTIM ADVOCATE AND PREVENTION EDUCATOR I CAL STATE UNIVERSITY DOMINGUEZ HILLS. GOOD AFTERNOON I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR HAVING ME TODAY AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER SURVIVE THIS FOR INTRODUCING THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL. MY NAME IS MEYER RAMON I INTO SEXUAL ASSAULT VICTIM ADVOCATE A PREVENTION EDUCATOR I CALIFORNIA STATE DOMINGUEZ HILLS. I HAVE BEEN A SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR FOR ELEVEN YEARS INCLUDING SEVEN YEARS IN HIGHER EDUCATION AND HAVE PROVIDED DIRECT SUPPORT TO OVER THREE HUNDRED SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. I'M HERE TO SUPPORT IT EIGHTEEN F. A. B. EIGHTEEN AB SEX. AS A SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO PROVIDE A SAFE SPACE AND SUPPORT SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT. SEXUAL SAW IS A VERY TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCE THE LONG TERM EFFECTS. MY JOB IS TO MINIMIZE THE IMPACT PULSE ASSAULT. STUDIES HAVE SHOWN THAT HAVING A SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR MINIMIZES THE RISK FOR POSTTRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER AND FACILITIES REPORTING MEDICAL AND PSYCHOLOGICAL CARE. IN MANY INSTANCES SEXUAL SUCK CANCERS OTHER FIRST RESOURCE THE SURVIVORS ENCOUNTER. WE DO OUR BEACH WE INFORM STUDENTS THAT WE ARE A CONFIDENTIAL RESOURCE. IF A STUDENT DECIDES TO FOLLOW THE POLICE REPORT OR TITLE NAY REPORT WE ARE THEREDURING THE ENTIRE PROCESS TO PRICE SUPPORT. ONE ASPECT OF OUR WORK OFTEN MISUNDERSTOOD IS OUR SCOPE. WE ACTUALLY PROVIDE A COMPANY WITH AND SUPPORT OUTSIDE CAMPUS INCLUDING ACCOMPANIMENTS TO START EXAMS WHICH ARE ALSO KNOWN ASK YOU TO RAPE KITS OR MEDICAL FRIENDS EXAMS. WE ALSO CREDIT COMPANY MINSKOFF CAMPUS TO THE COURT SYSTEMS AND OFF CAMPUS LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES. WE PROVIDE A SIMILAR RANGE OF SERVICES AS OUR COMMUNITY BASED RAPE CRISIS CENTERS BUT TAYLOR TOOK COLLEGE STUDENT POPULATION. SINCE WE ARE PART OF THE CAMPUS CULTURE COMMUNITY WE ARE ASSESSABLE AND MANY SURVIVORS TRUST US AND FEEL SAFE SEEKING SUPPORT WITH THE CAPUS BASED SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR. CAMPUS BI SEXUAL SO CANCERS ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE PROTECTIONS UNDER STATE LAW TO ENGAGE IN PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS AND QUALIFY UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE SECTION TEN THIRTY FIVE POINT TWO. HOWEVER THERE IS INCONSISTENT CHARACTERIZATION OF WHO QUALIFIES THE SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR. SO PRACTICING SEXUAL* COUNSELORS AND OTHER AGENCIES THAT SUPPORT SURVIVORS BELIEVE THE CAMPUS BASED SEXUAL ASSAULT CANCERS ARE NOT QUALIFIED. UNDER THE CALIFORNIA EVIDENCE CODE AND CANNOT PROVIDE FOR PRIVILEGED COMMUNICATIONS. THIS ASSERTING AMONGST SEXUAL SUCK COUNSELORS INTERFERES WITH OUR ABILITY TO FULLY SUPPORT SURVIVORS. JUST IMAGINE THAT A SURVIVOR WAS BRAIN ENOUGH BRAVE ENOUGH TO TRUST JUST CAMPUS SEXUAL SUCK COUNSELOR. BUT THEN IT'S INFORMED BY SOMEONE ELSE A DIFFERENT AGENCY THAT IN FACT. WE ARE ACTUALLY NOT PRIVILEGED AND CONFIDENTIAL AS WE HAVE STATED TO THEM. WHAT AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY SIX WILL DO IS CLARIFIED SINCE STRINGENCY AND VALIDATE THE CAMPUS BASED SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELORS ARTIFACT PRIVILEGE? UNDER THE EVIDENCE CODE THIS WILL ALLOW US TO ADVOCATE FOR OFF CAMPUS RESOURCES MORE EFFECTIVELY. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT STUDENTS SURVIVORS FEEL SAFE TO ACCESS THE CAMPUS SEXUAL ASSAULT COUNSELOR. AND THAT THEY RECEIVE A CONSISTENT MESSAGE THAT THEIR CONVERSATIONS AND SERVICES ARE CONFIDENTIAL AND PROTECTED. I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU REGARDING EIGHTY EIGHT NINETY SIX. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB EIGHTEEN NINETY SIX MY NAME IS SO SEVEN YES AND I'M A STUDENT ACT ATTENDING CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY DOMINGUEZ HILLS AND I'M ALSO THE SOCIAL JUSTICE AND EQUITY SPEAKER. AND CHAIR OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION. THE CALIFORNIA STATE SENATOR CA SHARE REPRESENTS A RIVER HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE CSU SYSTEM AND IS A PROUD SPONSOR OF THAT SPELL I WANT TO PERSONALLY THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER SAVANT THIS REINTRODUCING THAT'S. AND PROTECTING STUDENTS. I'M. THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE LAW HAD DEPRIVE VICTIMS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT OF BEING FULLY SUPPORTED AND DIRECTED. TO THE APPROPRIATE FOR ALL SUCH AS COUNSELING CENTER THAT'S NEEDED BALK AT THE CENTER STUDENT WELLNESS AND CAMPUS ARE COMMUNING LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND ESPECIALLY CAMPUS WITH A SEXUAL THOUGHT COUNSELOR AND ALSO INTERFERE WITH THE RIGHT TO BE ACCOMPANIED TO MEETINGS. BETWEEN THE VICTIM AND POLICE PROSECUTORS ARE MEDICAL PROFESSIONALS DUE TO THE FEAR THAT COMMUNICATION BETWEEN THE CAMPUS SEXUAL THOUGHT COUNSELOR VICTIM ARE NOT PRIVILEGED. SOME OF THE QUESTIONS VICTIMS ENCOUNTER PRESSURE THE VICTIM TO MAKE IMPORTANT LIFE I'M CHANGING DECISIONS AT THE MOMENT. QUESTIONS THAT MAY FURTHER DISEMPOWERED VICTIMS AND ALLOW THEM TO BLAME THEMSELVES FOR THE ASSAULT ONE INVADING A VICTIM'S PRIVACY. BUT SUCH A BONE OF A MOMENT IT IS IMPORTANT SEXUAL ASSAULT SURVIVORS TO FEEL SUPPORTED AND BE GRANTED. THE OPERA BREA AND. CORRECT INFORMATION THROUGHOUT THEIR ENTIRE HEALING PROCESS. WHICH IS OFTEN UNCLEAR AND DIFFICULT BY CLARIFYING THE LANGUAGE TO ENSURE COMMITTEE AUDI AND PROTECTION OF THE SURVIVORS TO CAMPUS WITH COUNSEL A PRIVILEGE. IT IS MY HOPE THAT STUDENTS SURVIVORS OF SEXUAL ASSAULT THAT SEEK HELP OR INTERVENTION FROM THEIR COLLEGE UNIVERSITY SHELLING COUNTER HE SYSTEM THAT PROVIDES TOM INFORMED COORDINATED CONFIDENTIAL SUPPORT. THAT ADDRESSES THEIR NEEDS BEING A VICTIM OF SEXUAL ASSAULT CAN NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE STUDENTS MENTAL PHYSICAL HEALTH OVER A WELLNESS AND ACADEMIC OUTCOMES. SUCH A FAILURE AND DEPRESSION OR ANXIETY. I ASK THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION AND STUDENTS ABILITY YOU HAVE CONTROL OVER HOW THEY WISH TO RESPOND EMPOWERING SURVIVOR IS ENSURING THAT WE CLOSE THE GAPS THAT PREVENT OUR STUDENTS FROM FEELING SAFE. STUDENT SURVIVORS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DISTURB POSITIVE SCHOOL CLIMATE AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT.

OKAY WE'LL GO NEXT TO MR HOLD. HAS TWO BILLS. TO PRESENT. ITEM EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN YOU LIKE TO BEGIN WITHOUT. OR. ALRIGHT SO WILL BEGIN WITH ITEM EIGHT TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'D LIKE TO THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY PERCENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN. THE BILL TO ENHANCE PROTECTIONS. A COLLEGE STUDENT ATHLETES. I INTRODUCED TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN BECAUSE OF THE PSYCHOLOGICAL WOUNDS OF AMATEURISM WE VIEW COLLEGE ATHLETICS THROUGH HAS OBSCURED OUR VISION A REALITY. OUR OLD SURE IDEALIZED CONCEPT OF AMATEURISM AND COLLEGE SPORTS IS MYTH THAT ENABLES THE STATUS QUO. AND CONSEQUENTLY THE ENSUE TO A TO IMPLEMENT POLICIES THAT HARM COLLEGE ATHLETES PHYSICALLY. EMOTIONALLY AND FINANCIALLY. WELL IMPROVEMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE OVER THE PAST TWO DECADES THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN OF THE GOODNESS OF THE NC TWO WAYS HARD. IT HAPPENED BECAUSE ATHLETES AT ADVOCATES FOUGHT FOR FAIRNESS IN QUESTION A SYSTEM. THAT IS EXPLOITED TO. RECENT NEWS SHOWS US MORE PROGRESS NEEDS TO BE MADE. THE STUDENT GENOCIDE MICHIGAN STATE ENDURED ABUSE ABUSES WHILE THE ADMINISTRATION. COACHING STAFF AND TITLE NINE OFFICE BILL TO ADDRESS IT. INSITU A THREW UP ITS HANDS SAYING THAT DID NOT HAVE THE JURISDICTION. WHILE THIS WAS A FAR REACHING TRAGEDY SADLY THESE TYPES OF ABUSES OF COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE NOT UNIQUE. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN SEEKS TO ADDRESS PROBLEM IN A NEW WAY BY REQUIRING EVERY COACH EMPLOYEE OF THE ATHLETIC PROGRAM. AND REPRESENTS AT THE IN SITU A TO BE MANDATED REPORTERS FOR ABUSE EVEN IF THE STUDENT. IS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. THIS BILL ALSO SEEKS TO ADDRESS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ATHLETES FACE BY ALLOWING INSTITUTIONS TO CREATE A TRUST FUND. OR COLLEGE ATHLETES. WHICH ALLOWS THEM TO RETAIN ANY FUNDS THEY EARN UNTIL AFTER THEY GRADUATE. THE DEGREE COMPLETION FUN IS A MECHANISM SCHOOLS CONFUSED TO CREATE. AND CHOOSE HOW IT WILL BE USED. OPTIONS FOR POTENTIAL FUNDING INCLUDE FINANCIAL AWARDS GIVEN FOR ATHLETIC ACHIEVEMENT. THE OLYMPIC AWARDS. REVENUE THE SCHOOL MAKES FROM METEORITES AND ENDORSEMENTS OR STIPENDS IF THE IN SITU A OR COURTS ALLOW THEM TO BE AWARDED TO ATHLETES. AN EXAMPLE OF THE LAST OPTION IS THE IT O'BANION VERSES INSITU A CASE. A US DISTRICT COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF O'BANNON AND REQUIRED SCHOOLS TO AWARD FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS. THE ATHLETES PER YEAR WHILE THEY'RE IN SCHOOL FOR THE USE OF THEIR NAMES IMAGES. AND LIKE WITH LIKELY LIKELINESS. THIS RULING WAS LATER CHANGED BY THE NINTH CIRCUIT WHO ALSO RULED IN FAVOR OF A BAD AND BUT SAID SCHOOLS CAN ONLY OFFER STUDENTS FUNDING UP TO THE COST OF ATTENDANCE. IF A FUTURE COURT DETERMINED STIPENDS ARE APPROPRIATE THIS BILL CREATES A TRANSPARENT RESPONSIBLE ONE FLEXIBLE MECHANISM SCHOOLS CAN USE TO ALLOW STUDENTS TO BENEFIT. FROM THOSE FUNDS. THIS BILL IS PERSONAL FOR ME. BEFORE I STARTED MY JOURNEY IN PUBLIC SERVICE I PLAYED COLLEGE BASKETBALL FOR SAN DIEGO STATE UNIVERSITY. WHILE THE IN SITU A WAS OUT THE MULTI BILLION DOLLAR ORGANIZATION IT IS TODAY. I HAVE FIRST HAND EXPERIENCE AND KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO BE A COLLEGE ATHLETE. THIS COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE PUTTING EVERYTHING ON THE LINE AND RISKING THEIR BODIES AND FIRST PSALM ONE INJURY AWAY FROM LOSING EVERYTHING. OTHERS ARE AT RISK OF LOSING IT ALL FOR SPEAKING OUT FOR THEIR TEAM OR ANY ABUSES THERE EXPERIENCING US COLLEGE COACHES HAVE THE POWER TO KEEP YOU ON. OR OFF THE TEAM. THE NC TO A MAKES BILLIONS IN REVENUE WHILE ATHLETES ARE GIVING THEIR ALL TO THEIR SPORT. AND THEIR EDUCATION WITHOUT THE SAME RIGHTS AS OTHER STUDENTS ON CAMPUS. WHILE RECOGNIZING THAT MUCH NEEDS TO BE DONE. I'M ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AND NARROWING MY BILL TO ADDRESS THE TWO AREAS. DESCRIBED ABOVE. SPECIFICALLY THE BILL WILL STRIKE SECTIONS ONE AND TWO AND AND MISTER CHAIR IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME. I WANTED TO READ THE AMENDMENTS INTO THE RECORD BECAUSE I KNOW BECAUSE OF THE LATENESS OF HOW THE AMENDMENTS WERE BEING PRESENTED. THAT THEY MAY NOT BE BEFORE YOU SO IF WITH YOUR PERMISSION. WITH PERCY. US SO THE BILL WHAT SPECIFICALLY STRIKE SECTIONS ONE AND TWO. AMEND SECTIONS THREE TO SAY AN INSTITUTION OF HIGHER LEARNING MAY ESTABLISH A DEGREE COMPLETION FUN. STRIKE SECTIONS FOUR AND FIVE. AND KEEP SECTION SIX WHICH AMEND SECTION ELEVEN ELEVEN SIXTY FIVE POINT SEVEN OF THE PENAL CODE. TO EXPAND THE MANDATED REPORTER RESPONSIBILITIES IN THIS SECTION TO COLLEGE STUDENTS OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR OF THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL WILL LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. AT TO REFINE THE LANGUAGE AND ADDRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE SEGMENT. I WITH ME TODAY AS WITNESSES A REMOTE OUT REMOTELY HUMA. NATIONAL COLLEGE. A PLAYER'S ASSOCIATION EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR AND ANDY SCHWARTZ AND ECONOMISTS AND PARTNER. AD O. SK ARE AN ECONOMIC CONSULTING FIRM. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR I. THINK YOU THOUGHT BEFORE YOU BEGIN I JUST WANT TO REITERATE WHAT I SAID AT THE BEGINNING. THAT I THE POLICY IN THIS COMMITTEE IS TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. AND NOW WE'RE GONNA HEAR TO THAT. YOU MAY BEGIN. THANK THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MANDY SCHWARTZ I'M AN ECONOMIST WITH THE WHAT'S CARE AREN'T EMERYVILLE. I'VE BEEN STUDYING COLLEGE SPORTS ECONOMIC SINCE NINETEEN NINETY NINE. I'VE ENCOUNTERED A LAUNDRY LIST OF MYTHS Y. IT SOMETHING LIKE A DEGREE COMPLETION FUND CANNOT WORK. THE FIRST MYTH YOU'LL HEAR IS THAT COMPETITIVE BALANCE WILL BE HARMED IN THAT'S FALSE. THE BROAD CONSENSUS OF SPORTS ECONOMISTS IS THAT. THE NCA CAPS ON INDIVIDUAL ATHLETE EARNINGS. BENEFITS DO NOT ENHANCE COMPETITION VIRTUALLY ALL STAR ATHLETES OVER NINETY NINE PERCENT SIGNED WITH SCHOOLS AND POWER CONFERENCES. ALABAMA KENTUCKY DOMINATE THEIR SPORTS BECAUSE OF THE CAPS NOT DESPITE THEM. SECOND MYTH THAT TITLE NINE DOESN'T ALLOW SUCH FUNDING IS FALSE. WOMEN'S SPORTS SHARE IN A IMPROVE BENEFITS RECENTLY THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION CLARIFIED THAT OF MALE ATHLETES RECEIVE COMPENSATION ABOVE COST OF ATTENDANCE. THAT TITLE NINE REQUIRES A PROPORTIONAL MATCH FOR FEMALE ATHLETES. AND SO IT'S CAPS ARE LIFTED MALE AND FEMALE ATHLETES RISE TOGETHER. WHICH IS WHY SINCE TWENTY FIFTEEN A SCHOOLS HAVE ADOPTED CO WAY FOR MEN THEY'VE DONE SO IN PROPORTION FOR WOMEN. THIRD MYTH THAT IT WOULD DESTROY NON REVENUE SPORTS IS ALSO FALSE. THERE ARE SEVEN HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE DIVISION TWO AND THREE SPORTS PROGRAMS WITH OVER TWO HUNDRED SIXTY THOUSAND. ATHLETES AND NONE OF THEM HAVE PROFITS FROM FOOTBALLER BASKETBALL BUT THEY MANAGED TO SPONSOR SPORTS. FOR EXAMPLE YOU WITHOUT BIG FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL THEY'RE ABOUT AS MANY DIVISION TO ACROSS PROGRAMS IN THE COUNTRY. AS DIVISION ONE. FOURTH MYTH SMALL SCHOOLS WON'T BE ABLE TO COMPETE. ALSO FALSE ANY SCHOOL THAT FEELS THAT THE FUNDS IN QUESTION ARE GOOD OPPORTUNITY ARE FREE NOT TO MAKE THEM. THOSE WILL BE THE SAME SCHOOLS THAT AREN'T PAYING THEIR COACHES MILLION DOLLARS. MINISTRY DOES HAPPEN MILLION DOLLARS THERE ARE THREE EARNED FIFTY ONE DIVISION ONE SCHOOLS WHEN CO A WHAT'S ALLOWED ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY ADOPTED AT THE REST DIDN'T BUT. STILL ONE MARCH MADNESS ROLLED AROUND WE GOT TO SEE SCHOOLS COMPETING FROM BOTH LEVELS WITH GREAT UPSETS. THE MARKET HAS ALREADY SORTED OUT THE PECKING ORDER AND THIS BILL IS AN EXAMPLE OF THE WAY THAT WE CAN HARNESS THOSE MARKET FORCES. TO REACH OUT IMPROVE SOCIAL OUTCOME FINALLY IN CLOSING I JUST WANT TO REMIND EVERYBODY IN TWO THOUSAND THREE THAT WAS A HEARING AT THE STATE SENATE. SAYING THE COST OF ATTENDANCE WOULD CAUSE ALL OF THE SAME PROBLEMS THAT WERE YOU MAY HEAR ABOUT TODAY. NONE OF THEM HAPPENED ONCE YOU IT WAS A LOT THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. A GOOD AFTERNOON A. MANAGER MOBILE HOME OF THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL COLLEGE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION WHICH THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN. AND ETHICS COMMITTEE TO VOTE YES. BY THE NCA A. HAS PUBLICLY DECLARED IT HAS NO DUTY TO PROTECT. COLLEGE ATHLETES ARE TO ENSURE BECAUSE ATHLETES ARE QUITE EDUCATION. THEN SAY WAS ALSO FOUND GUILTY OF VIOLATING FEDERAL ANTITRUST LAWS BY INSTITUTING AN ILLEGAL PRICE FIXING SCHEME. THE HARM TENS OF THOUSANDS OF CALIFORNIA BECAUSE ATHLETES. WHY WOULD THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOLLOW THE ANSWER EASILY? WHY WOULD ALLOW DANCE H. PROHIBIT COLLEGES FROM USING A PORTION OF REVENUES FOR TO CREEK A DEGREE COMPLETION FINE? OUTLINED THIS BILL. ESPECIALLY WHEN CALIFORNIA BECAUSE AT THE GRADUATION RATES RANK AMONG THE WORST IN THE COUNTRY. AFRICAN AMERICANS SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATE NEGATIVE IMPACT CLEMENTE LIMITS AS A MAKE UP THE MAJORITY OF THE TEAM THAT PRODUCED THE MOST REVENUE TO SUFFER THE LOWEST GRADUATION RATES. THERE'S NO CREDIBLE REASON TO OPPOSE THIS BILL. AFFECT IT'S QUITE EASY TO DISCREDIT FALSE ARGUMENTS A MESS AGAINST THIS DEGREE COMPLETION FUN. BUT A GROUNDBREAKING TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN STUDY REVEALED A MORE SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN OPPOSING SUCH A PROGRAM. THE STUDY FOUND THAT RACIAL RESENTMENT AGAINST AFRICAN AMERICANS IS THE PRIMARY FACTOR FUELING THE OPPOSITION TO INCREASING COMPENSATION FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES. THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SHOULD NOT ALLOW UNDERLYING RACIAL RESENTMENT TO INTERFERE WITH PROGRESS TOWARD EQUAL RIGHTS. AB TWENTY SEVEN FORTY SEVEN CAN EMPOWER CALIFORNIA COLLEGES TO SOLVE GRADUATION RATE PROBLEMS IT LEVY EIGHT RACIAL DISPARITIES. HELP PAY FOR MEDICAL EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EXTENSIVE CHRONIC SPORTS INJURIES. AND ADVANCE BECAUSE ATHLETES TOWARD ECONOMIC FREEDOM THE CALIFORNIA GRANTS OTHER STUDENTS AND CITIZENS. IF THIS BILL IS APPROVED GRADUATION RATES WOULD SKYROCKET PERIOD. NANCY P. ASPIRATE YOUR YOUR YES VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU. ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY TWEENER. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. DID WE HAVE TO WITNESS WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. SO IT. TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON I MANAGER MARTINEZ THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. WE REALLY. WERE OPPOSED THE BILL AS IT WAS PUT ACROSS WITHIN. INTENDED BE HEARD TODAY. OBVIOUSLY THE BILL'S BEEN SIGNIFICANT AMEND ITS. FOR THE GOOD OF THE AUTHOR. OUT WE ARE STILL TRYING TO DIGEST OF THE AMENDMENTS AND WHAT THEY MEAN TO THE SYSTEM I THINK. AT THIS POINT WE HAVE TO GET A SENSE OF HOW THOUGH RULES ABOUT THE ACCOUNT WHICH WOULD INTERACT WITH THE NCA NOW THAT WOULDN'T IMPACT OUR OBLIGATIONS TO OUR STUDENT ATHLETES TO COMPETE. IN ATHLETICS ARE THE CSU WE HAVE. NINE DIVISION ONE SCHOOLS IN TWELVE VISION TO SCHOOLS ARE THAT ALL HAVE TO BE CAPTURED BY THIS BILL. I THINK OR THE OTHER BIG CONCERN FOR THE CSU IS THE MANDATORY REPORTING LANGUAGE IN THE BILL. BACK CURRENTLY THE BILL AMENDS AT SECTION TWO AT ALL. STUDENT ATHLETES ROSA BEING OVER THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN OR NOT. AND IT SAYS THAT YOU HAVE TO BE A NEW REPORT ANY ABUSE OR NEGLECT THAT RESULT PERSON WOULD BUT. DEAN APPROPRIATE WE WERE ADDED TO THE MANDATORY PART BECAUSE SECTION BECAUSE THE SANDUSKY EVENTS IN TWO THOUSAND TWELVE PRIVATE BANKING BROUGHT. IT WAS AWESOME INTERFERENCE TICKETS IN THE HAVE THAT LANGUAGE TO THE BILL. BECAUSE THEIR KIDS EVER ON CSU CAMPUSES IN THE SUMMERTIME ARE YOU SEE OR ANY OF THE CAMPUSES THAT WERE A ENGAGED ON THOSE ACTIVITIES AND THERE MIGHT BE SOME. EVENT THAT MIGHT TAKE PLACE AND THAT SHOULD BE REPORTED. BUT SO BECAUSE OF THAT ALSO IF YOU'LL PLEASE OR MANDATORY PORTERS I MANDATORY BORDER. TO SOME DEGREE. BUT. BECAUSE THAT MODIFICATION TO LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT'S A MISDEMEANOR IT'S A SIX MONTH PENALTY IT'S ABOUT DOLLAR FINE. A I GUESS WHAT OF THE HOW THE LANGUAGE GETS CHANGED WHEN IT GETS AMENDED AND HOW THAT WORKS BECAUSE I THINK THAT IS CONCERNED GOING FORWARD. THANK YOU. ERICA ROMERO ME HALF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPRESENTING THE PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT WE WERE ALL SUPPOSED TO THE BILL AS IT CAME ACROSS THE DESK. AND WE DO UNDERSTAND OF COURSE WE ARE WITH THIS ISSUE WE NEED A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO DIGEST AND ALSO TO SEE THE ACTUAL LANGUAGE. ALTHOUGH IT WAS REYES THAT IT'S FALSE THAT THERE'S A COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE YOU WERE TALKING ABOUT IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR INSTITUTIONS WHOSE BUDGETS ARE UNDER A MILLION DOLLARS FOR ATHLETICS. UP TO OUR LARGER INSTITUTIONS ARE CURRENTLY COVERED BY THE STUDENT ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS. AND IN OUR SECTOR THE CAL GRANT DOESN'T COVER TUITION. AND SO OUR INSTITUTIONS ARE STRUGGLING TO MEET THE FINANCIAL NEED OF OUR NEEDIEST STUDENTS AND WE SHOULD BE WORKING HARD TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA'S LOW INCOME STUDENTS. CAN ACCESS PRIVATE HIGHER EDUCATION AND SIMPLY ISSUE BECOMES. DEPENDING ON HOW THIS INSTRUCTED THAT THE INSTITUTIONS ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR FINANCIAL MEDIA STUDENTS MAY NOT CREATE THESE FUNDS WERE OTHER INSTITUTIONS MAY HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO SO. AND SO IT DOES CREATE A DISPIRITING AMONGST THE INSTITUTIONS AS OUR INSTITUTIONS STRUGGLE TO MEET FIRST THE NEEDS OF FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS WHETHER THEY'RE ATHLETES OR NOT. AND SECONDLY RELATED TO THE MANDATED REPORTER ISSUE AGAIN WE NEED TO SEE. THE LANGUAGE AS IT'S CRAFTED. RIGHT NOW OUR. COACHES ARE AS AND STUDENTS UNDER EIGHTEEN. IF THERE IS A TITLE NINE VIOLATIONS THAT SOMEBODY WAS AWARE OF IF THERE'S A HARASSMENT OR ASSAULT IT'S PROPERLY HANDLED BY THE TITLE NINE OFFICES. WHO ARE QUICK TO DO THIS AND OF COURSE THERE'S ALSO OTHER TYPES OF REPORTING UNDER CLEARY STOP WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING LANGUAGE TO SEE WHAT EXACTLY? DOT LANGUAGE THAT'S. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JANET LOPEZ REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. ALLY MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUES AT THE TABLE WE OPPOSED THE PERSIAN IMPRINTS AND LOOK FOR DISSING THE LANGUAGE MOVING FORWARD THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS TYLER I DO ARE ON BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA WE ECHO THE CONCERNS THAT A I CEASE YOU IN CS YOU RAISED I'M WE READ A LETTER IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL THAT'S IN PRINT. AND BUT WILL LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE AND. LOOK FOR TO WORKING ON IT IN ADDITION TO THIS HEARING THANK YOU THANK YOU. BOB NAIL REPRESENTING STANFORD UNIVERSITY MORE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL. IT'S OBVIOUSLY MUCH IMPROVED BUT WE ARE READY TO WITHDRAW OUR OPPOSITION. I WOULD POINT OUT THAT STANFORD STUDENT ATHLETES HAVE A BETTER GRADUATION RATE DONE THE STUDENTS AS A WHOLE. GIVE. ANY COMMENT SIR. QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. MS BAKER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND. WE HAVE SEE OTHERS NUMBERS STAND UP TO CAL. ATHLETES BUT WE'LL SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER HEARING. I THINK THE MANDATED REPORTER PROVISION ALONE IS ENOUGH OF A REASON WHY I'M GOING TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL. I DID I THINK THAT IS THE RIGHT LANGUAGE TO HAVE AND I I HOPE IT WON'T GET WEAKENED AS IT GOES TO OTHER LOCATIONS I REALLY WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT BECAUSE IF IT IS. THERE MEMBERS WILL BE VERY VOCAL IF IT IT IF IT IS WEAKENED. I SHARE THE CONCERNS HOWEVER PARTICULARLY THE. OF THE OPPOSITION ABOUT THIS FUND MEN THE FUND IS VERY I KNOW WHAT IT'S GOING TO BE THE LANGUAGE IS VERY PRECISE IS UNUSUAL FOR US I THINK IS A POLICY COMMITTEE DEBT. SO WHAT'S SOMETHING OUT THAT THAT HAS. IT IS THAT UNDETERMINED. SOAK IT CERTAINLY KEEP AN EYE ON IT I SIR HAPPY TO TAKE YOUR WORD ABOUT WHAT THE AMENDMENTS WOULD BE I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT YOU TO HOLD TO THAT IT'S JUST I'M. HOLD STRONG ON THE MANDATED REPORTER LANGUAGE AND AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN. GET SOME MORE DETERMINATION THAT WHAT THIS FUND WILL BE AND AND WHO AND HOW WILL BE MANAGED WITH THE CONCERNS AND YOU KNOW I'VE GOT ST MARY'S COLLEGE MY DISTRICT AND JUST THE INDEPENDENT NONPROFIT. COLLEGES ACROSS THE STATE THAT I THINK ARE ARE VALID CONCERNS. SO THANK YOU AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE YOU KEEP STRONG WITH THAT LANGUAGE. WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE MISTER HOLD. UP THE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND I APPRECIATE THE THE COMMENTS AND YES WE WILL HOLD FIRM ON THIS I KNOW THAT. HOW WE WORK VERY CLOSELY WITH THE CHAIR AND I DO APPRECIATE HIS ENGAGEMENT ALONG WITH STAFF BECAUSE THERE WERE OTHER TO OTHER? VERY IMPORTANT PARTS TO THIS THAT WE. ARE BELIEVED NEEDED TO BE EXPLORED THEY WERE THEY WERE INDEED. CHALLENGING WE NEEDED TO HAVE. IT'S A LITTLE BIT MORE TIME TO SORT OF FIGURE OUT HOW TOWARD ARCHITECT TO A STRATEGY AROUND THEM. BUT I THINK THAT THESE TO GIVE. SEARCHED CERTAINLY WITH A MANDATED REPORTER I THINK IT REALLY DOES BEEF UP BECAUSE WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN. INSTANCES OF WHERE. A SOMETHING FELL THROUGH THE CRACKS AND SO THIS IS AN ATTEMPT TO TRY TO. A PLUG BET UP IN AN AS A REAL PLACE TO THE OF THE FUND. IT'S A MECHANISM THAT WE'RE CREATING AND SCHOOLS WILL HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO. TO USE IT. ARM AND DETERMINE HOW. TO USE IT WHO AYE IF WE LOOK AT THE O'BANNON CASE. OF THAT IS NOT INCONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE COURT HAD DETERMINE THEIR FINDINGS. HAD IT BEEN IN PLACE IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN AN EASIER PLACE FOR THE JUDGE TO SAY HERE'S HOW YOU WOULD PLUG IDEA. AND HERE'S HOW IN THE CASE OF THE LOWER COURT THE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS WOULD BE. HOW COULD BE HANDLED AND THIS WOULD BE HELD IN TRUST UNTIL? THE. GRADUATION OR TILL THE THE PLAYING TIME IS EXPIRED OF THE ELIGIBILITY HAD RUN OUT. OF OR THEY WOULD LOOKING TO EXTEND THEIR EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITY AND THERE WERE RESOURCES THERE TO DRAW UPON.

AB TWELVE TWENTY TO TWENTY WILL EXPAND ON THE SIGNIFICANT STRIDES MADE. BY THE STUDENT ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS TO PROTECT COLLEGE ATHLETES UNDER CURRENT LAW. THE STUDENT AT THE BILL OF RIGHTS ONLY APPLIES TO INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETIC PROGRAMS AT FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION THAT RECEIVED TEN MILLION DOLLARS OR MORE IN ANNUAL REVENUE. DERIVED FROM METEORITES FOR INTERCOLLEGIATE ATHLETICS THIS MEANS ONLY COLLEGE ATHLETES AT UCLA UC BERKELEY U. S. C.. AND STANFORD ARE PROTECTED UNDER CURRENT LAW IS HAS CREATED TWO TIER SYSTEM IN OUR STATE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR COLLEGE ATHLETES COLLEGE ATHLETES. WHO HAVE PROTECTIONS UNDER THIS DO NOTHING BILL OF RIGHTS FOR HIS COLLEGE ATHLETES WHO CONTINUE? TO LEAVE IT ALL ON THE FIELD FOR THEIR SCHOOL WITHOUT A GUARANTEE THAT THEIR SCHOOL WOULD BE WILLING TO DO THE SAME FOR THEM. CURRENTLY FORTY THREE CALIFORNIA SCHOOLS WITH COLLEGIATE ATHLETIC PROGRAMS IN DIVISION ONE AND TO HAVE THE AUTONOMY TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO PAY FOR AN ATHLETE'S MEDICAL EXPENSES. IF THE ATHLETE GETS INJURED ADDITIONALLY COLLEGE ATHLETES WHO GET INJURED DURING PRACTICE OR GAME ARE NOT PROTECTED FROM LOSING. THEIR ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIPS AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY WILL REQUIRE INSTITUTIONS TO PAY THE DEDUCTIBLE FOR COLLEGE ATHLETES WHO SUFFER SPORTS RELATED INJURIES AND FOR THE COST OF ONGOING MEDICAL TREATMENT. FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS AFTER A STUDENT HAS GRADUATED OR LEFT THE UNIVERSITY. A FURTHER AB TWENTY TO TWENTY REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO PROVIDE AN EQUIVALENT SCHOLARSHIP WITH THE STUDENTS. STUDENTS ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP IS NOT RENEWED DUE TO THE INJURY. WITH AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY WE CAN GIVE A COLLEGE ATHLETES ACROSS. CALIFORNIA THE ABILITY TO SUCCEED BOTH IN THE CLASSROOM AND IN THE FIELD AFTER ALL THEY ARE STUDENT ATHLETES. STUDENTS FIRST ATHLETE SECOND WE ARE NOT TURN OUR BACKS ON COLLEGE ATHLETES IN THE MOMENTS WHEN THEY NEED US MOST. I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOU AYE VOTE ON THIS BILL THAT WILL EXPAND. THE ARABS DO NOTHING BILL OF RIGHTS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT. HER CHAIR AND COLLEAGUES WITH ME HERE TODAY IS REMOTELY HOA EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE NATIONAL COLLEGE PLAYERS ASSOCIATION. OUR THANK YOU AGAIN. SO THE NASA BECAUSE PLAYERS THOSE ISSUE THE SPONSOR OF AB TWENTY TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY. NASA'S COMMITTEE FOR YES YES VOTE. OUR A RECENT STUDY REVEALED THAT SIXTY SEVEN PERCENT OF COLLEGE ATHLETES SUSTAIN A MAJOR COLLEGE SPORTS INJURY. AND FIFTY PERCENT OF COLLEGE ATHLETES WILL SUFFER FROM CHRONIC SPORTS INJURIES. THESE ARE OTHERWISE SOME OF THE HEALTHIEST PEOPLE ON THE PLANET. THE PLAYING SPORTS FOR CALIFORNIA COLLEGES PERFECT PERSON AT SIGNIFICANT RISK. UNDER NCAA RULES COLLEGES CAN FORCE PLAYERS TO PAY THE MEDICAL EXPENSES. SPORTS RELATED INJURIES CAN EVER DIRECT NEGATIVE EFFECT ON A PLAYER'S ABILITY TO GRADUATE. AND UNDER NCAA RULES COLLEGES CAN REFUSE TO RENEW AN ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP FOR PERMANENTLY INJURED PLAYERS. CALIFORNIA COLLEGES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT GRADUATION A PROBLEM THEIR RANKS AMONG THE WORST IN THE NATION. EIGHTY ONE OF CALIFORNIA COLLEGE TEAMS ACROSS TWENTY NINE DIVISION ONE AND DIVISION TWO COLLEGES HAVE GRADUATION RATES BELOW SIXTY PERCENT. WITH AN AVERAGE GRADUATION RATE OF FORTY FIVE PERCENT. CALIFORNIA DIVISION ONE INDIVIDUAL WHO COLLEGES HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS. BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND THREE IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DIVISION TO REVENUE AMONG CALIFORNIA COLLEGES INCREASED FROM SEVENTEEN MILLION DOLLARS TO ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS IN ANNUAL REVENUE. THIS IS A REVENUE INCREASE OF SIX HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. NOTABLY PARTICIPATION ONLY INCREASE FORTY SIX PERCENT. CALIFORNIA DIVISION ONE COLLEGS AND ENJOYED A REVENUE INCREASE OF FOUR HUNDRED SIXTEEN MILLION DOLLARS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. WHAT PARTICIPATION NUMBERS ACTUALLY DECREASED BY ELEVEN PERCENT? THESE COLLEGES CAN AFFORD PROVIDES PROJECTIONS. THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO DIRECT SOME OF THIS WINDFALL REVENUE THAT TO GRADUATE AND GUARANTEE MEDICAL SERVICES FOR THE PLAYERS WHOSE BODIES ARE BROKEN BY GENERATING THIS MONEY FOR THE COLLEGES. BECKY. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY TWEENER WHO'S. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION GOOD AFTERNOON ERICA ROMERO BEHALF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES REPRESENTING THE PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT INSTITUTIONS IN THE STATE. AND WE ARE RESPECTFULLY COME VISIT YOUR LOCAL NONPROFIT INSTITUTION AND VISIT OUR SPORTS DEPARTMENTS AND SEE HOW WE TAKE CARE FIRST IT. THE SAFETY AND WELL BEING OF OUR STUDENTS IS PARAMOUNT TO US AND WE TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY UNFORTUNATELY WITH THE SUIT ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS. AND REMOVING THE TEN MILLION DOLLAR CAP. YOU'RE PLAYING THIS TO ANY INSTITUTION THAT OFFERS AN ATHLETIC SCHOLARSHIP. AND AS WE TALK ABOUT REVENUES WANT TO GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF OUR INSTITUTIONS WHEN WE REPORT REVENUES TO THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND PRO REQUIRED TO DO SO. IT JUST SOUNDS REVENUE SO WE ASK WHAT IT LOOKS LIKE. ON ONE CAMPUS REVENUES THE WAY WE THINK ABOUT IT ITS TERMS OF ATHLETICS SALES TICKET SALES. IS TWENTY THOUSAND OAKS. THE REST OF THE MONEY TO MILLION DOLLARS IS FROM GREECE BY THE CAMPUS TO ALLOW THE STUDENTS TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PARTICIPATE IN CAMPUS SPORTS. IT'S ALL FUN GREATEST. AND SO AS YOU INCREASE COSTS TO INSTITUTIONS THERE IS GOING TO BE A TREAT. AND UNFORTUNATELY WHAT WE'D LIKE TO BELIEVE INSTITUTIONS CAN JUST KEEP FUNDRAISING WE HAVE OTHER COSTS WE FUNDRAISE FOR AS WELL. FOR SCHOLARSHIPS FOR ALL OF OUR STUDENTS ARE CAPITAL OUTLAY WHICH THE STATE DOES NOT FUND AND THESE PROGRAMS ARE VERY SMALL. IN ADDITION THIS BILL ACTUALLY CAPTURES INSTITUTIONS THAT DON'T PLAY IN THE NC DOUBLE A. THERE ARE SEVENTEEN INSTITUTIONS FIFTEEN OF THEM BELONG AND PRIVATE NOT FOR PROFIT OUT WHEN YOU SEE ONCE IT'S YOU. WHO PLAY IN THE NBA? AND THE AVERAGE CAMPUS SIZE IS UNDER A THOUSAND STUDENTS FOR THESE AND YET THERE ARE GOING TO BE REQUIRED TO PLAY UNDER THE SAME RULES. IN DIVISION TWO IN ADDITION THERE ARE NO MULTI YEAR SCHOLARSHIPS. UNTIL RECENTLY THEY WERE NOT ACTUALLY TO GIVE OUT SCHOLARSHIPS EVEN FOR THE FULL YEAR IT WAS IN RECOGNITION OF THE SIZE OF THE BUDGETS OF THESE INSTITUTIONS. AND SO ESSENTIALLY UNDER THE SPELL WE ARE INCREASING COSTS BECAUSE WE SAVE YOUR INTERVIEWER NOW GUARANTEED THE SCHOLARSHIP. AND SO REMEMBERING THAT OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR STUDENTS GRADUATE WE TAKE THEIR SAFETY VERY SERIOUSLY. BUT AT INSTITUTIONS AGAIN WHERE WE DON'T WE NEED THIS COULD MEAN YOU TAKE THE SCHOLARSHIP FROM A FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENT WHEN THE STUDENT TO NOT HAVE MADE. GOOD AFTERNOON ANGIE MARTINEZ CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY. WE TOO MUST BE OPPOSED TO THE BILL. THIS WOULD MAKE ALL OF THE TWENTY ONE. SCHOOLS OF THE CSU THAT OFFERED DIVISION ONE TO SCHOOLS GOT CAPTURED BY IT SAFER. BUSTER MATHIS BILL OF RIGHTS. THERE WAS SOME DISCUSSION WILL POINT THAT SAN DIEGO STATE MAY HAVE BEEN CAPTURED BY THE ORIGINAL. TO THE BILL BUT THEY NEVER WERE CLOSE TO THE TEN MILLION DOLLARS. IN MEDIA REVENUE THEY WORK AT BEST TO THE TWO MILLION DOLLARS IN MEDIA REVENUE I THINK THAT AT THAT. WHEN YOU THINK OF CSU SPORTS INDIGO STATE FRESNO STATE THOSE ARE THE BIG TWO SPORTS PROGRAMS AT THE CSU AND THERE ARE FAR BEHIND WHERE THE OTHER ATHLETIC PROGRAMS ARE. YOU THINK OF WHEN YOU THINK OF THE STRONG ROBUST AFFECT PROGRAMS NATIONALLY. SO OF THE CSU CAMPUSES AGAIN WE HAVE NINE DIVISION ONE INTO A TWELVE DIVISION TO ATHLETICS. AND THIS BILL IN ADDITION TO THE REPLACEMENT SCHOLARSHIP FOR INJURED ATHLETES THIS WOULD REQUIRE US TO GIVE A REPLACEMENT SCHOLARSHIP FOR THE FIFTH YEAR FOR STUDENTS WHO GRADUATED. THAT IS GOING TO COME OUT OF THE BUDGET OF THE DIVISION TWO SCHOOLS WHICH IS OPERATING NOT OFF MEDIA REVENUES BUT OFF OF. FUND RAISING OFF OF A. STUDENT FEES. AT THAT SUPPORT THOSE PROGRAMS THAT ARE OPERATING ON A SHOESTRING BUDGET THOSE ARE GOING TO BE A COST TO THE SYSTEM TO MANAGE. AND IT WASN'T. JUST LOST LAST FALL A C. IS YOU HUMBOLDT WAS CONSIDERING SHUTTING DOWN FOOTBALL THOSE DIVISION TO PROGRAM. THAT IS JUST HOW CLOSE THEY WERE TO CONSIDERING WHAT HOW DO WE MEASURE BUDGET HOW WE MANAGED THE EXPENDITURES. AND PAY FOR ALL THOSE EXTRA EXPENSES. IN ADDITION WE'RE ALSO REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT THEY WERE THE RIGHT OF ACTION IN THE BILL OF DEBTS CAN EXPOSE A STRAWBERRY LITIGATION AND IT'S IT'S GOING TO GROUP PARTICIPATE FOR THE ATTORNEY FIGHT CAR FEES ASSOCIATED WITH THE. PUBLISHED A SABRE AND ANY BAD PENALTIES THAT THE COURT DECIDES IT TO BEYOND APPROPRIATE THAT AGAIN BECAUSE OF THE BUDGET OF THE OPERATING FOR THE ETHICS PROGRAMS AS WELL THAT THOSE OF THE OF THE REASON WHY MUST BE OPPOSED THE BILL AS CURRENTLY IN. FORM. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JANET LOPEZ REPRESENTING THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION SPECIFICALLY AROUND THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION LANGUAGE INCLUDED IN THE BILL THINKING. TYLER I DO ARMY AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND WE DO HAVE TO SCHOOLS THAT FULLY COMPLY WITH THE S.. SP SEEN BILL OF RIGHTS SOON ATHLETE BILL OF RIGHTS UC BERKELEY AND CAL BUT APPLYING THIS TO OUR INSTITUTIONS WOULD BE PROBLEMATIC FOR THE REASONS THAT CSU ANY I SEE CEO. HIGHLIGHTED SO WE REMAIN OPPOSED THE BILL THANK YOU. BOB NAYLOR REPRESENTING STANFORD UNIVERSITY WERE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL THANKS AMENDMENTS TAKEN IN THE PREVIOUS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. SEEING NONE. STIR BONTA WOULD YOU LIKE TO. CLOSE. YES IT YOU KNOW I I'M APPRECIATE THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS ABOUT COST AND WE CONTINUE TO INVITE AT A CONVERSATION THAT IS. A A SPECIFIC CONVERSATION ABOUT ACTUAL COSTS THAT WOULD BE INCURRED. FROM THIS BILL WE'VE DEATHLY HEARD. THE BROAD CONCERNS THAT THE THEORETICAL ADDITIONAL COSTS. BEEN SUGGESTED AND ALSO A YOU KNOW GENERAL ARE REFERENCES TO INCREASE COSTS BUT. BUT I'M I REALLY LIKE TO SEE IF THEY HAVE IT THAT THE DATA AROUND AT INDIVIDUALS WHOSE WHO HAVE ON SCHOLARSHIP OF GOT INJURED. AND HOW THAT'S LED TO INCREASE COSTS AND THEN ONCE WE HAVE THAT I THINK THE DATA CAN HELP. HELP GENERATE THE SOLUTION BUT. TO BE ABSOLUTELY CLEAR CLEAR OVER TALK ABOUT HERE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT. SCHOLARSHIPS FOR ATHLETES THAT HAVE BEEN BUDGETED. THAT HAVE BEEN GIVEN BY THE SCHOOLS. TO AN INDIVIDUAL IN THEIR BUDGET THEY WANTED TO GIVE IT THEY HAVE THE MONEY FOR IT THEY RAISE THE MONEY FOR IT. AND. SO WHERE IS THE ADDITIONAL COST IT JUST SAYING IF THAT PERSON GETS HURT. DON'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM THEY'VE MADE LIFE DECISIONS ABOUT WHERE TO GO TO SCHOOL AND WHAT WHAT THEY CAN AFFORD BASED ON THE SCHOLARSHIP THAT'S BEEN OFFERED TO THEM. AND SO. THERE STUDENT. GRADUATE FROM THEIR YOUTH FOR THEM INSTITUTION DON'T TAKE IT AWAY FROM THEM DON'T TURN YOUR BACK ON THEM BECAUSE THEY CAN'T PLAY. ON YOUR SPORTS FIELD EVEN THOUGH THEY'LL STILL BE IN YOUR CLASSROOM. THE ONLY ADDITIONAL CASA BE IF THEY DECIDE THAT THEY WANT A TO OFFER AN ADDITIONAL SCHOLARSHIP THAT YEAR. FEAR NEITHER HAVE SCHOLARSHIPS FOR WOMEN SOCCER. AND YOU GIVE THEM ALL UP AND ONE PERSON GETS INJURED. YOU STILL PAY FOR NINE AND HAVE SCHOLARSHIPS YOU HAVE EIGHT EIGHT IT YOU KNOW YOU HAD HAVE MET MANY PEOPLE PLAYING. YOU MIGHT NOT BE OF GIVEN ADDITIONAL SCHOLARSHIP MIGHT HAVE TO SPREAD THE EXISTING SCHOLARSHIPS OUT SO THAT THEY'RE NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT THE COULD BE NINETY PERCENT. BUT THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL COSTS UNLESS YOU'RE SAYING YOU MUST HAVE THE RIGHT. STRIP AN INDIVIDUAL OF THEIR SCHOLARSHIP AND OFFER TO SOMEONE ELSE. IT AND AND AND AND THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO GIVE IT TO TO THE INDIVIDUAL WHO HAS BEEN HURT THEIR HURT PLAYING A SPORT THAT YOU INVITED THEM TO AND RECRUITED THEM TO AND ONE OF THEM TO AT YOUR AT YOUR FIELD. ARE AT YOUR SCHOOL. COULD BE THROUGH NO FAULT OF YOUR OWN ACCIDENTS HAPPEN SPORTS I KNOW THAT FIRST HAND. SO. WE NEED THAT MAKES YOU HAVE OUR PRIORITIES RIGHT HERE. THAT WERE SUPPORTING ACADEMIC SUCCESS OF OUR STUDENT ATHLETES NOT JUST ATHLETIC SUCCESS IN THAT WE SUPPORT OUR STUDENTS THROUGH GRADUATION THAT AT THIS BILL SEEKS TO DO. I THINK IT STRIKES AB BUT A GOOD BALANCE AND WE HAVE A ONGOING OPEN MINDEDNESS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC FINANCIAL CHALLENGES WE HAVE HEARD ANY YET. I AND SO WHEN WE DO OUR WE ARE VERY EXCITED TO TO HELP PROVIDE A SOLUTION. IT'S THE PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE'VE ALSO SAID WE DON'T NEED A PRIVATE RIGHT OF ACTION WE JUST NEED SOME ACCOUNTABILITY ENFORCEABILITY THAT CAN'T BE AYE. OPTIONAL THING THIS NEEDS TO BE SOMETHING WHERE IF I STUDENTS NOT TREATED RIGHT AND THIS THIS DO NOT THE BILL OF RIGHTS IS NOT. ENFORCED THAT DATE THEY HAVE SOME A RECOURSE DOESN'T HAVE TO BE PART RIGHT PRIDE RIGHT OF ACTION I THINK I BELIEVE THAT WE'VE INVITED A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT HAVEN'T HEARD. OTHER OPTIONS YET WE CONTINUE TO INVITE THAT CONVERSATION CONTINUE TO BE OPEN MINDED ABOUT DIFFERENT WAYS TO HAVE ACCOUNTABILITY WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY. ASK YOU I VOTED THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT TODAY. THANK YOU MISTER BONTA. I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION. MOVED BY MISTER LEVINE SECOND BY DOCTOR WEBER. THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD AYE AYE HAS SUPPORTED THE BILL AN ARTS AND ENTERTAINMENT. COMMITTEE AND I'M HAPPY TO US SUPPORTED AGAIN TODAY. TIME SECRETARY WHO WOULD CALL THE ROLL. THE MOTION AS DO PASSED TO THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE MEDINA AYE AYE MEDINA AYE BAKER. ARAMBULA. ARAMBULA I BLOOM CHáVEZ. CHAVEZ NO IRWIN. KILEY LEVINE LEVINE AYE LOW. LOW AYE PATTERSON QUIRK SILVA. QUIRK SILVA AYE SANTIAGO WEBER. WEBER I. IT'S ONE A THAT BILL IS ON CALL. AND WE HAVE A ITEM SIXTY. A. B. THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR COLLEAGUES TO FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT MY SECOND BILL TODAY A. B. THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN. THANK YOU FOR THE WORK THAT STAFF HAS PUT INTO IT. IT THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN WOULD ESTABLISH MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR UC'S NCS USE AND PRIVATE FOUR YEAR INSTITUTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR IN A STUDENTS COST TO ATTEND THE ACADEMIC INSTITUTION THE GOAL HERE IS TO REALLY HAVE. THAT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE. MATCH THE ACTUAL COSTS THAT A STUDENT IS GOING TO. IN ENSURE AND FACE WENT WOMEN IN. SCHOOL AND IN COLLEGE RIGHT NOW WE SEE A LOT THERE'S A LOT OF HIDDEN COSTS A LOT OF UNEXPECTED COSTS. THAT ARE BURDEN A STUDENT BECAUSE IT WASN'T IN AT THE COST OF ATTENDANCE SO A. WE WANNA THAT I CHANGE THAT HAVE A MORE COMPREHENSIVE COST OF ATTENDANCE LOOK. AND THAT'S WHAT WE PROPOSE IN AB THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN SO I AM I HAVE IT WITH ME TODAY MAGGIE WHITE STUDENT TRUSTEE FOR THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY TO PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY. UNDER* HERE I GET AFTERNOON EVERYONE THINK IF AS OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TO YOU TODAY. AND MY NAME IS MAGGIE Y. MST* HE STANISLAUS TESTING AMERICA THE CSU BOARD OF TRUSTEES AND A PRIVILEGE TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE CAL STATE STUDENT ASSOCIATION AND. REPRESENT NEARLY HALF MILLION STUDENTS OF THE CSU SYSTEM. AT THE COST OF COLLEGE HAS INCREASED FINANCIAL AID HAS NOT KEPT PACE AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE THE ONES WHO ARE HARMED. IT IS CRITICAL THAT STUDENTS HAVE ACCESS TO UP TO DATE INFORMATION ABOUT THE FULL COST OF ATTENDANCE WHICH EXTENDS FAR BEYOND THE PRICE OF TUITION. THIS PROPOSED FORMULA AS ESSENTIAL SECTIONS THE TOTAL COST ESTIMATE INCLUDING TECHNOLOGY TRANSPORTATION AND DEPENDING COST LIKE CHILD CARE. WE KNOW THAT THESE COSTS ARE VERY REAL AND AFFECTS STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE IN THEIR ABILITY TO COMPLETE THEIR EDUCATION. ACKNOWLEDGING THE REALITY OF THE COST OF COLLEGE ATTENDANCE WILL INCREASE EQUITY AND IMPROVE STUDENT SUCCESS. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE SPELL AND THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. ANY TWEENER. COME THE TWO WINNERS. ERICA ROMERO BEHALF THE ASSOCIATION OF INDEPENDENT CALIFORNIA COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES WE HAVE SHARED SOME CONCERNS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE. WHENCE WE INCLUDE SOMETHING AND COST OF ATTENDANCE WE HAVE TO PACKAGE THE STUDENT OBVIOUSLY WE WANT TO GIVE THEM ACCURATE BECAUSE. WE ARE ALL VERY MUCH LOOKING FORWARD TO THIS YEAR'S SURVEY PROVIDING UNIFORM INFORMATION TO ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S HIGHER EDUCATION. VICTOR CONCERN DOES. A CURRY AND IN A DIVERSE SECTOR FOR INSTANCE IN SOME OF OUR INSTITUTIONS WE DON'T ACTUALLY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE. POLICIES AND SO HOW DO WE LIST THAT I'M FOR EXTRA CURRICULAR ACTIVITIES. THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN TO US IS THAT WOULD CROSS WHICH IS FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS IS OUT OF. THE REACH OF SOME STUDENTS HOWEVER ONCE WE PROVIDE ALONE CHU STUDENT. WE CAN'T TAKE IT BACK AND SO IT INCREASES POTENTIAL DEBT BURDEN THEY CAN COME TO APPEAL TO THE SUPREME WHAT TO PLAY AN EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY. HOWEVER BECAUSE WE BUDGETED UP FRONT WHAT HAPPENS IS WE START WITH OUR LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS. AND AS YOU GO UP THE INCOME SCALE YOU GET A LARGER GAP BECAUSE WE HAD TO PUT THE SAME AMOUNT IN FOR EVERY STUDENT WHETHER OR NOT HE DID IT. I'M MORE HAPPY TO CONTINUE THE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE THANK YOU. THE AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS ALEX GRAVES OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THE BILL. I THINK WE WOULD. AGREE WITH MUCH OF CON WHAT'S OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS IN TERMS OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN THINKING ABOUT IS A RELATES TO THIS BILL. WE ALSO LOOK FORWARD TO THE INFORMATION THAT IS BEING GATHERED THROUGH THIS YEAR STUDY CURRENTLY BEING CARRIED OUT BY THE STUDENT AID COMMISSION. I AND WE THINK THAT THAT WILL BE A USEFUL CONSUMER INFORMATION TOOL FIVE FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES AS THEY TRY TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH COLLEGE GOING TO COST AND WHERE THEY WANT TO GO THANK YOU. THANK YOU. YEAH AFTERNOON TYLER RIGHT YOU ARE IN BEHALF OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE ONE SPECIFIC CONCERN AROUND THE FREQUENCY OF FINANCIALLY DISBURSEMENTS. AND WE'VE REYES THAT. AND I KNOW IT'S BEEN. TOPIC OF DISCUSSION BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE BILL AND. WORK AT THE OTHERS OFFICE THANK YOU. I BY NO SORRY I'M AN UNDERGRADUATE USED TO BERKELEY BOARD MEMBER OF THE UNIVERSITY COP Y. STUDENTS ASSOCIATION AND WHERE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. AND YOU. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. A. DOCTOR WEBER. BOB JUST THAT I WOULD IMPACT DOES THIS HAVE ON THE OVERALL BUDGET FOR FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE FOR STUDENTS. WE KNOW. THE COST OF ATTENDANCE IS IS YOU TO DETERMINISTIC OF FINANCIAL AID PACKAGE UNITS AT THE UPPER LIMIT ON ON HOW MUCH FEDERAL STATE AND INSTITUTIONAL FINER FINANCIAL AID A STUDENT CAN RECEIVE SO. THIS WILL BECAUSE EIGHT EIGHT. AS A MORE APT ACCURATE COMPREHENSIVE ASSESSMENT OF THAT ALL THE CASA STUDENTS GONNA FACE WHILE IN. COLLEGE IT IT WILL RAISE THE ELIGIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL AID TO HIGHER AMOUNTS. AND I'M SICK AND COULD LEAD TO HIGHER FINANCIAL AID PACKAGES RIGHT NOW. BECAUSE CERTAIN THINGS ARE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION AS COST OF ATTENDING COLLEGE OF STUDENTS ARE GETTING LOWER. OUR AMOUNTS OF OF SUPPORT UNLESS THINGS ARE ELIGIBLE TO BE PAID FOR AND THEN WHEN THEY SAY WHEN THEY SEE THAT THEY NEED TRANSPORTATION TO GET HOME DURING. OUR THE WINTER BREAK WHEN THE UNIVERSITY CLOSED OR OR OR DURING THE SUMMER OR THEY NEED A LAPTOP TO THEIR SCHOOL WORK AND TO HAVE ACADEMIC SUCCESS IN THE CAN'T USE TO FINANCIAL AID FOR THAT. THAT CREATES A PROBLEM LEADS TO KIDS. YOUNG PEOPLE WORKING MORE HOURS WHICH IMPACTS THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS OR MAYBE EVEN DROP OUT OF SCHOOL WHICH CERTAINLY IMPACTS ACADEMIC SUCCESS SO. IT PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR MORE MORE ROBUST FINANCIAL SUPPORT THAT REALLY MATCHES THE COSTS OF COLLEGE DOES THAT DOES THAT THEN MEAN THAT FEWER STUDENTS WILL RECEIVE FINANCIAL SYSTEM. IF THE AMOUNT THAT ONE STUDENT RECEIVED HIS HIGHER. THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW DOES THAT MEAN I MEAN SO MUCH TO TALK ABOUT THESE FINANCIALLY POT IS IF THEIR NEVER ENDING THAT THEY EXIST. AND THAT THERE IS A FINITE NUMBER THAT'S THE AMOUNT THAT WE DO SO THERE'S THIS MEANS. FEWER STUDENTS WILL GET FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE BUT THOSE WHO GET IT THEY GET AT A HIGHER RATE THAT'S A QUESTION. I DON'T KNOW BUT. I I UNDERSTAND THAT THAT THE LOGIC AND THE LICKED THE CONCEPTUAL. AND HOUSES AND BUILT INTO THE QUESTION. IT COULD BE THAT BECAUSE THE COST FOR STUDENTS ARE GOING HIGHER THAN THAN. CERTAIN UNIVERSITIES WITH RESOURCES WELL WONDERFULLY FUN THE FINANCIAL AID. IT COULD BE IF THEY'RE IN FINANCIAL STRAITS THAT THEY MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO FUNDED AS FROM MORE ABOUT HIS PAST AS ROBUST AS POSSIBLE BUT THIS PROVIDES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR IT TO BE FUNDED. AND AND AND MORE ROBUST WAYS FOR FOR STUDENTS. WHENEVER YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT SORT OF ZERO SIMON AND LIMITED PIES THEN. THEN YOUR YOU KNOW YOUR QUESTION. COULD RAISE CONCERN BUT WE HOPE THAT FINANCIAL AID WILL GROW WITH THE INCREASING ELIGIBILITY IN THIS BILL. OKAY I AM. I FIND THIS INTRIGUING AND AND OBVIOUSLY WANT TO BE AS SUPPORTIVE AS I CAN I'LL I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE TODAY I WANNA. PARTY TALKS TO MY FOLKS IN FINANCIAL AID IS FIND OUT EXACTLY WHAT THE IMPACT IS. ON THAT SOME AREAS I AGREE AT THE CENTRAL I'M I'M FROM OLD SCHOOL SOUL IT IF YOU DON'T HAVE EXTRACURRICULAR ACTIVITY BUT YOU HAVE THE CURRICULA ACTIVITY I'M HAPPY. BECAUSE YOU HAVE CLASS AND BOOKS AND STUFF YOU NEED SOME NOT SURE IF THAT IS YOU KNOW I. I THINK THERE'S A THERE'S A THERE'S A. THERE IS A COST OF GOING TO SCHOOL NOT ONLY THE FINANCIAL PART BUT THE PERSONAL PART AS WELL. AND I OFTENTIMES IT SEEMS AS IF I STUDENTS WANTED ALL. AND I KNOW THE FOLKS WHO DIDN'T GET IT ALL BUT GOT ENOUGH WHAT I MEAN BY THAT IS TO GET THE TUITION PAID FOR THE BOOKS THEIR LODGING. AND AND FOOD AND THOSE KINDS OF THINGS WOULD COULD THEY JOIN A TEAM OF LACROSSE OR WHATEVER. PROBABLY NOT YOU KNOW AT THAT POINT WAS TO GET A SCHOLARSHIP OR. WHERE WE PAYING FOR THEIR BOWLING NIGHT OUT WHICH STUDENTS SOMETIMES LIKE TO DO PROBABLY NOT I MEAN? YOU KNOW THERE'S A PRICE YOU PAY FOR BEING A STUDENT OFTENTIMES AND NOT DO SHE SUFFERED BECOME HOMELESS IS WE HAVE SOME SITUATIONS AND HUNGRY. BUT I'M NOT SURE IF ALL OF THIS FACTORS INTO WHAT I THINK PERSONALLY THAT THE STATE OUGHT TO BE FUNDING FOR STUDENTS TO GO TO COLLEGE THAT THAT'S THE ONLY THING. SO. NOW SUPPORTED AND I AM CONCERNED SOMETIMES THAT THAT WE'VE RUN OUT OF MONEY. BUT SOME SOME AND THEREFORE SOME STUDENTS DON'T GET MONEY FOR. TUITION AND BOOKS IN THOSE KINDS OF THINGS THAT THEY NEED TO HAVE BECAUSE THERE IS A THERE IS A POT OF MONEY AND THE MORE YOU FUND THE MORE YOU GIVE WAY. IT'S GONE AND SOME CAMPUSES ARE DON'T HAVE FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AND MARCUS I GAVE IT ALL OUT. I WOULD HATE TO THINK THAT WE GIVE HIGHER NUMBERS AND FACTOR IN THESE OTHER THINGS AND NOT TAKE YOUR THE BASICS SO. I'LL BE SUPPORTIVE OF DAVE AB I WON AND I HAVE TO LOOK AND SEE. WHAT IMPACT FINANCIAL IMPACT THIS WOULD HAVE ON THE OVERALL POT AND THE NUMBER OF STUDENTS WHO WERE ABLE TO SIR? I I REALLY APPRECIATE AS ALWAYS YOUR YOUR INSIGHT DOCTOR WEBER ON MANY ISSUES CERTAINLY AND WHEN IT COMES TO HIGHER EDUCATION POLICY. THAT THEY ARGUED YOU'VE JUST MADE AND THAT OTHERS HAVE MADE ABOUT THE EXTRA QUICK THE COMPONENT THE BILL IS IS REALLY. I'M RAISING QUESTIONS WITH ME AND AND AND AND CREATING AN OPTION FOR SOME SOME SELF REFLECTION AND I THINK IT'S AN AREA WHERE WHERE WHERE. OPEN TO SOME VERY SIGNIFICANT AMENDMENTS GOING FORWARD GOOD I I'D LIKE TO LOOK AT THAT BECAUSE I I DON'T WANNA STUDENT. S. POURS OUR STUDENTS ARE DON'T WANT TO STUDENT NOT HAVE WHAT THEY NEED IN TERMS OF BOOKS AND TUITION AND WHAT HAVE YOU. HAVE SUPPORT KIDS LOCKED OUT BECAUSE WE DECIDED THAT SOME OF THE KEY IT LIKE TO DO A LOT OF EXTRACURRICULAR STUFF. AND UP YOU KNOW I ALWAYS BELIEVED YOU KNOW GET THE CURRICULA STEP CORRECT AND THE OTHER THINGS AND AND YOU KNOW YOU COULD MAKE THE CAN DO SOME OF THESE THINGS OCCASIONALLY. BUT ANYWAY I I'LL SUPPORT FOR NOT THAT THINK WE DO NEED TO HAVE A REALISTIC VIEW OF IT. I'M THINKING MORE IN TERMS OF A REALISTIC WITH THE GOSSIP. OF THE COST OF HOUSING IN CERTAIN NEIGHBORHOODS AND MUCH MORE THAN SOMEWHERE ELSE YET AND THAT'S WHAT CAUSES A LOT OF KIDS BECOME HOMELESS BECAUSE. IT'S IMPOSSIBLE TO LIVE AROUND YOU SEE AS THE GOD A LAWYER SOLOS IN THE STUDENTS THAT HAVE LIVE FAR AWAY TAKE TRANSLATION OR THEY DON'T HAVE HOUSING AT ALL SO. I KNOW THAT THAT'S A REALITY FOR A LOT OF CAMPUSES ALLOW STUDENTS TO COST OF LIVING IS IS RATHER HIGH BECAUSE OF THE HOUSING THAT'S IN THE COMMUNITY. THOSE OF REALISTIC THINGS WE NEED TO LOOK AT FOR STUDENTS. AND I AND I THINK THOSE THAT'S IMPORTANT WE DO BEGIN TO HAVE A REALLY SKEWED VIEW OF CAMPUS BY CAMPUS IN TERMS OF WHAT IT TAKES TO LIVE THEE. I APPRECIATE YOUR COMMENTS AND WILLING TO TO LOOK AT THE EXTRA CURRICULAR. THANK YOU MISTER RUN TO WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANKS FOR THE DISCUSSION AFFECT WE ASK DRIVE OUT.

SO NEXT WE HAVE A ITEM FOURTEEN MS CUTTY ó. A. B. THIRTY ONE OR ONE WELCOME MISGUIDED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AGAIN. I GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M HERE TO PRESENT A. B. THIRTY ONE OH ONE. A MEASURE TO SIMPLIFY THE LENGTHY AND COMPLICATED. COMMUNITY COLLEGE APPLICATION FOR CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE WITH THE CURRENT FETHIYE APPLY APPLICATION AS LONG CONFUSING. AND OCCASIONALLY INTRUSIVE. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE STUDENTS SPEND AN AVERAGE OF OVER AN HOUR COMPLETING THE APPLICATION FOR ADMISSION. TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE QUESTIONS ARE OFTEN REPETITIVE OR UNNECESSARY SUCH AS RESIDENTIAL QUESTIONS TO DETERMINE. TUITION LEVELS FOR NON CREDIT STUDENTS WHO ARE NOT REQUIRED. TO PAY TUITION WHILE COMMUNITY COLLEGE ACROSS THE STATE RECOGNIZE THIS PROBLEM AND HAVE WRITTEN TO MY OFFICE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. WE TOOK IT UPON OURSELVES TO LOOK INTO THE APPLICATION. WE WERE SHOCKED THAT IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THE MAILING INFORMATION PORTION THE FIRST QUESTION ON THE PERSONAL INFORMATION SECTION. OFTEN ARE AT ACTUALLY OUT POTENTIAL STUDENTS TO CHOOSE AN OPTION FOR THEIR GENDER IDENTITY AND THEIR SEXUAL ORIENTATION. WE WE'RE BEING ASKED TO PICK BETWEEN STRAIGHT GAY LESBIAN BISEXUAL OTHER DECLINE TO STATE BEFORE EVEN IN PUTTING ANYTHING RELATED TO A HIGH SCHOOL GPA. WHILE WE RECOGNIZE THAT THE STATE THAT OFFICE THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE BACKGROUND OF OUR APPLICANTS. SUCH ABRUPT QUESTIONS ABOUT CITIZENSHIP GENDER OR RACE ETHNICITY FEEL. TACTICALLY AT A PLACE. THE APPLICATION SHOULD FEEL LIKE A WELCOMING FIRST STEP. TO AN INDIVIDUAL'S ACADEMIC JOURNEY. NOT AN INTERROGATION OVER FIVE PERCENT OF STUDENTS DO NOT FINISH THE APPLICATION. BUT WITH MILLIONS OF STUDENTS APPLYING EVERY YEAR THIS MEANS THAT WE LOSE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF GRADUATES IN FUTURE WORKERS. THIS IS UNACCEPTABLE. AND I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING COLLABORATE LEAN WITH THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. AND OTHER STAKEHOLDERS TO STREAMLINE THE APPLICATION. OF THE APPLICATION PROCESS FOR ALL FUTURE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. I AM A PROUD GRADUATE OF DIESEL IS LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE GOD GAVE ME THE FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY FINISH AND START. MY. MY. HIGHER EDUCATION CAREER AND I UNDERSTAND THIS PERSONALLY IT'S AS A FIRST GENERATION AMERICAN IT IS. THE FIRST STEP. IN TRYING TO BE THE VERY BEST THAT WE CAN BE ONE OF MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR STUDENTS ACTUALLY ACCESS. HIGHER EDUCATION WITH ME TO TESTIFY OUR DOCTOR RYAN GARDNER VICE CHANCELLOR FROM THE ALLEY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AND WE THOUGHT NEVADA AT THE VICE PRESIDENT OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA. MAY PROCEED. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS RYAN CORNER ON THE VICE CHANCELLOR FOR EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS FOR THE LOS ANGELES COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. AND WE ARE SPONSORING. THIS BILL AUTHORED BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO. WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IS ALLOW OUR COLLEGES ARE OUR COLLEGE SYSTEM TO REVISE THE CCC APPLY APPLICATION TO INCLUDE DATA THAT? IS ONLY THE DATA THAT IS REQUIRED IN ORDER FOR STUDENTS TO ATTEND THE COLLEGE AND TO COLLECT OTHER DATA. AFTER THE STUDENT HAS ALREADY MATRICULATED THROUGH THE SYSTEM. CURRENT PROCEDURES AND REGULATIONS LED TO A LENGTHY APPLICATION. WHICH TAKES OVER AN HOUR TO COMPLETE IN LEADS TO FIVE PERCENT OF OUR POTENTIAL STUDENTS ABANDONING THE PROCESS. THIS REPRESENTS NEARLY QUARTER MILLION STUDENTS ABANDONING OVER THE LAST FOUR YEARS. A QUARTER MILLION STUDENTS. THE PROBLEM IS ESPECIALLY IMPACTFUL IN OUR REGION. BECAUSE EIGHT OUT OF TEN OF THE COLLEGES WITH THE HIGHEST ABANDONMENT RATE RESIDE IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY. SEVEN OF THEM ARE COLLEGES. THESE COLLEGES RANGE WITH AN ABANDONMENT RATE FROM SEVEN PERCENT TO ELEVEN PERCENT. THIS THIS ISSUE RAISES QUESTIONS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT. THE APPLICATION PROCESS IS IMPACTING. CERTAIN POPULATIONS FROM BEING ABLE TO ATTEND COLLEGE. WHAT WE ESTIMATE IS THAT WERE IMPACTED IN THE TUNE OF OVER TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS EACH YEAR JUST FOR OUR DISTRICT? ELLIE CCD SUPPORTS THE COLLECTION OF NEEDED STUDENT DATA I'M A RESEARCHER BY TRADE AND I I LOVE HAVING ACCESS TO THIS DATA. BUT WE FEEL THAT IT'S MORE IMPORTANT TO MATRICULATE STUDENTS INTO THE SYSTEM THAN IT IS TO COLLECT CERTAIN DATA ELEMENTS. AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRYING TO FIND WAYS WITH THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO COLLECT THOSE DATA ELEMENTS. AT A LATER TIME AFTER THE STUDENTS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY IN ROME THE CLASSES THAT THEY NEED. STUDENTS IN OUR SYSTEM OR VERY A MAJORITY ARE FIRST GENERATION COLLEGE STUDENTS MORE THAN FORTY THOUSAND IN OUR SYSTEM HAVE NOT COMPLETED A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE. NON CREDIT PROGRAMS AND ROLE MORE THAN A HUNDRED AND THIRTY THOUSAND STUDENTS EACH YEAR. WITH MORE THAN EIGHTY EIGHT THOUSAND ENROLLMENTS IN ESL. AND YET ALL THE STUDENTS ARE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT THE SAME APPLICATION WITH THE SAME QUESTIONS. WE STRONGLY ENDORSE THIS AND WE HOPE TO HAVE HERE AYE VOTES THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN HE NOT AND. MEMBERS OF THE ASSEMBLY HEROD COMMITTEE ON MY NAME IS A SAD AND I'M WITH ME COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA. AYE THE LEAGUE IS PROUD TO SUPPORT THIS IMPORTANT BILL. THAT BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT A COLLEGE APPLICATION REPRESENTS THE BEGINNING OF AN EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY. AND RIGHT NOW THAT JOURNEY IS A SIN HAS TOO MANY BARRIERS THAT ARE IN MANY WAYS ARTIFICIAL AND ONES THAT WE'VE CREATED OURSELVES. AB THIRTY ONE A ONE WOULD TRIGGER A MUCH NEEDED REVIEW OF. CCC APPLY ENSURE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY IS INTUITIVE AND IT'S KEEPING UP WITH THE WAY THAT I. CALIFORNIANS ACCESS APPLICATIONS TO ENSURE THAT ITS MOBILE FRIENDLY THAT IT'S EASY. AND WE ALSO WERE COLLECTING DATA THAT IS IMPORTANT AND ACTUALLY NECESSARY TO MATRICULATE STUDENTS NOT JUST DATA THAT WE NEED FOR RESEARCH PURPOSES I CAN COLLECT AT A DATE AT A LATER DATE. THE CURRENT APPLICATION TAKES OVER AN HOUR. AND AND AS I MENTIONED INCLUDES QUESTIONS THAT COULD BE ARE COLLECTED LATER. AB THIRTY ONE OH ONE WOULD ENSURE THAT. EVERY ASPECT OF THE COMMUTE COLLEGE WORK IS DONE WITH THE STUDENT CENTERED FOCUS AND THAT BEGINS WITH AN APPLICATION THAT ENSURES THAT THEY CAN ACTUALLY BEGIN THEIR JOURNEY THANK YOU. A KID OTHER WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. SYNDICATE STAY ON BEHALF OF THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN STRONG SUPPORT. THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS MARK MCDONALD ON BEHALF OF THE FOOTHILL DE ANZA KERN LOS RIOS PERALTA AND SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE. DISTRICTS IN SUPPORT. ASHLEY WALKER WITH NASA MEN ON BEHALF OF NORTH ORANGE COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT. MOUNT SAN ANTONIO COLLEGE AND THE ASSOCIATION OF COMMUNITY AND CONTINUING EDUCATION AND SUPPORT THINKS. ALSO WEBSTER BEHALF OF THE COAST COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT IN STRONG SUPPORT. PRETTY THOMAS WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE I WOULD LIKE TO THANK BOTH THE OFTEN THE SPONSORS FOR THE WORK ON THIS BILL WHILE WE DON'T OFFICIALLY HAVE A POSITION AT THIS POINT. CLEARLY CCC APPLIES OF REPORTS TO A BOARD OF GOVERNORS AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE OFFICE OFFICE TO SUPPORT THE BILL. ANY TWEENER WHO'S. ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND IT. QUESTIONS COMMENTS. IT'S QUIRK SILVA. I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND I DEFINITELY NOTICE THAT ARE A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SUPPORT THIS BILL NORTH ORANGE COUNTY. AND OTHER ORANGE COUNTY COLLEGES BUT I JUST WANTED TO SEE IF YOU COULD I JUST GIVE US AN EXAMPLE OF SOME OF THE. WHERE IT LOOKS LIKE THE STUDENTS START TO? DECIDE TO GET OUT OF. COMPLETING THE APPLICATION PERSONAL QUESTIONS WHAT WOULD BE SOME OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT. WELL. THE APPLICATION ITSELF IS JUST OVER FOURTEEN PAGES LONG. YOU CAN ACTUALLY APPLY TO GET A FIREMAN CALIFORNIA MUCH FASTER WHICH IS ONE PAGE. AND HERE WE HAVE A THE ACTUAL APPLET BE APPLICATION AND ALL THAT ACTUALLY I RYAN SPEAK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT WHERE THE DROP BUT IT'S IN THE DATA THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS IMPORTANT AND CRITICAL TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE WE DO WANT TO UNDERSTAND. OF MINORITY GROUPS AND WHERE THEY STAND IT'S REALLY SIMPLY. THE. WHERE IN THE APPLICATIONS SOME OF THESE QUESTIONS ARE? YES ACCORDING TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE REVIEW OF THIS. THE BIGGEST DROP OFFICE IN THE PERSONAL INFORMATION QUESTIONS WHICH REPRESENTS TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THE TOTAL DROP OFF OUT OF THAT FIVE PERCENT ABANDONMENT RATE. AND I DO APPLAUD THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOR TRYING TO MAKE TWEAKS BECAUSE WHAT THEY DID IS THEY MOVED THE PERSONAL INFORMATION TO BE AT. BUT I THINK THAT THEM REARRANGING OF THE QUESTIONS IS A STARTING POINT BUT REALLY THERE NEEDS TO BE AN ANALYSIS TO MAKE SURE THAT THE QUESTIONS ARE. STUDENT FOCUSED AND DRIVEN TOWARD SUCCESS RATHER THAN JUST THE COLLECTION OF INFORMATION. BUT I GUESS WHAT MY QUESTION IS IS WHAT IS THE PERSONAL INFORMATION THAT THEY SEEM TO BE. HAVING AN ISSUE WITH I MEAN I KNOW. WHAT OPTION DO YOU HAVE THAT COULD YOU JUST READ A FEW OF THOSE QUESTIONS I COULD RETURN QUESTION I WOULDN'T KNOW WHICH ONES PARTICULARLY WHERE THE DROP OFF POINTS? BUT. WE WE PUT TOGETHER OUR APPLICATION PAPER WISE FOR STUDENTS WHO HAD DIFFICULTY ONLINE. AND THE FIRST SIX QUESTIONS ARE BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT DEMOGRAPHICS. WHERE THAT PEOPLE LIVE AND THEN IT GOES ON IMMEDIATELY TO CITIZENSHIP STATUS WHERE STUDENTS BEGAN WHEN STUDENTS BEGAN THEIR STAYING CALIFORNIA? HAVE YOU LIVED IN CALIFORNIA CONSISTENTLY. ARE YOU A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE OR SPOUSE OF A DEPENDENT OF A FULL TIME EMPLOYEE OF ANY OF THE FOLLOWING COLLEGES OR UNIVERSITIES ARE YOU FULL TIME CREDENTIALED EMPLOYEE OF CALIFORNIA PUBLIC SCHOOL ENROLLING IN COLLEGE. FOR THE PURPOSE OF CREDENTIAL RELATED REQUIREMENTS HAVE YOU BEEN EMPLOYED AS A SEASONAL AGRICULTURAL WORKER FOR AT LEAST THE TOTAL OF TWO MONTHS OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. OKAY I I JUST A THREE I WASN'T REALLY TRYING TO GET THERE BUT NOW THAT I'M HERE IN THESE QUESTIONS I CAN SEE WHY. A. I MEAN I DID GO TO A COMMUNITY COLLEGE MANY MANY YEARS AGO AND THIRTY YEARS AGO IF YOU. BUT YEAH THAT IS A LOT OF INFORMATION AND AND AGAIN GET I'M MOVING FORWARD AND IF YOU NEED THAT THERE'S OTHER OPPORTUNITIES. THANK YOU. DOCTOR WEBER PS AYE I APPRECIATE THAT AND. YOU KNOW WHAT I DID AT PROBLEM WAS I'D BEEN AT THE INSTITUTION TOO LONG I WOULD IMAGINE BECAUSE I DON'T FIND SPENDING AN HOUR FOR AN APPLICATION EXCESSIVE. I DON'T FIND THIS DIFFICULT TO DO IF YOU'RE INTERESTED IN GOING TO COLLEGE FISH WHEN YOU WANNA PICK EXAMPLE TWO TO THREE HOURS LONG. AYE AYE I THINK MAYBE THE RANGE ONE OF THE QUESTIONS COULD BE DIFFERENTLY BUT I COULD AS YOU READ THAT BECAUSE I'VE BEEN ON SEVERAL ADMISSIONS COMMITTEES. I UNDERSTAND WHITE ONE THOSE QUESTIONS WILL ASK BECAUSE EACH ONE OF PUT YOU IN A DIFFERENT CATEGORY FOR SUPPORT. AND ONE OF THINGS I WOULD HATE FOR US TO DO IS TO GET TO THE POINT WHERE SHE. SCRUBBING EVERYTHING SO MUCH THAT WE DON'T GET ENOUGH INFORMATION OF WHAT WE NEED TO HELP. YOUNG PEOPLE YOU KNOW THE FACT THAT IF YOU'VE DONE SOME WORK IN FARMWORKERS AT CERTAIN BENEFITS TO TO GET AS A RESULT OF THAT. ABOUT FINANCIAL SYSTEMS AS WELL AS OTHER KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE THERE. WE SOMETIMES SCRUB ALL THE INFORMATION SO WE DON'T KNOW FOR MEETING THE NEEDS OF DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATIONS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHO THEY ARE. OF BECAUSE WE CAN'T ASK PEOPLE OF QUESTIONS ABOUT THEIR ETHNICITY OR FIRST GENERATION AND THE SCHOLARSHIPS AND THINGS THAT COME WITH THAT IN SUPPORT. SO I THINK WE SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS ABOUT IT I THINK OF. HOPEFULLY THOSE WHO WANT TO LOOK AT IT WILL LOOK AT IT AND BEGIN TO SAY OKAY THIS IS. YOU KNOW THIS MAY BE IS NOT STATED AS FREELY AS WE'D LIKE TO HAVE IT STATED. BUT YOU KNOW BUT NOBODY GETS THE INFORMATION THAT WE NEED TO HAVE. YOU KNOW SOMETIMES IT IF YOU'RE A FIRST GENERATION STUDENT OF CERTAIN BENEFITS IF YOUR PARENTS ARE ALUMNI OF THAT INSTITUTION THEIR BENEFITS COME WITH THAT. SO I YOU KNOW I. YOU KNOW I I THINK. IT ANY ANY SORT OF QUESTIONS CAN BE DIFFICULT THE QUESTION BECOMES WELL NOT THE INFORMATION IS GOING TO BE USED FOR PURPOSES OF PROVIDING SUPPORT TO STUDENTS. RATHER EXCLUDING STUDENTS SHOULD NOT BE. WHETHER QUESTIONS ARE PUT MAYBE YOU KNOW COULD BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT OFFICE A CHECK BOX VERSUS SOME HAVING TO WRITE A LOT OF STUFF THOSE KINDS OF THINGS BUT. YOU KNOW I SYMPATHIZE EMPATHIZE A LITTLE BIT WHICH STUDENTS BECAUSE I KNOW STUDENTS WHO ARE APPLYING TEN TWELVE DIFFERENT SCHOOLS. AND A SPIN ALL NIGHT AND DAYS FILLING UP THESE APPLICATIONS BECAUSE OF THAT IMPORTANT O I THINK THIS IS A GOOD IDEA TO LOOK AT THE APPLICATION. ALL THAT'S THERE I THINK I HAVE BEEN SEEING SOME OF THESE THINGS OVER THE YEARS APPLICATIONS OF KIND OF GROWN BECAUSE OF THE. THE RESOURCES THAT COME WITH CERTAIN QUESTIONS AND AND IN THE APPLICATION WHERE ONCE IT WAS VERY FIRST SIMPLE BUT AS YOU BEGIN TO TALK ABOUT MEETING STUDENT POPULATIONS OF STUDENT NEEDS AND. ALL KINDS OF THINGS AS WELL AS PRE PLANNING FOR. WHAT KIND OF PROGRAM YOU WANT A NEED IF YOU GET STUDENTS WITH CERTAIN NEEDS TO THAT HAVE TO PRE PLANNED SOME OF THAT SO? I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY AND HOPE THAT. THAT AS WE LOOK AT IT A IT'S A IT'S A REALLY A MATTER OF TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW AN APPLICATION CAN HAVE AS YOU POINT OUT THE CENTRAL INFORMATION PEOPLE NEED TO HAVE. BUT NOT NECESSARILY GETTING TO A POINT WE HAVE SUCH AS BEEN APPLICATION THAT IT THAT EVERYBODY LOOKS THE SAME. YOU KNOW EVERYBODY'S APPLIED WE GOT ALL WE KNOW IS THAT WE HAVE OF FOUR HUNDRED STUDENTS COME A WILL MOST A MALE FEMALE OR WHATEVER. WE DON'T KNOW WHETHER OUR LGBT COMMUNITY NEEDS TO BE ALL SUPPORTED MORE BECAUSE NOW WE GOT STUDENTS AT IT THIS WAY AND OFTEN EVEN VETERAN STATUS IT ON CAMPUS WILL DETERMINE WHETHER THAT. THEIR VETERAN SERVICES. IT IN ANY GREAT NUMBERS SO. THAT. THESE KIND OF QUESTIONS ARE ARE IMPORTANT AND I THINK MAYBE IT YOU SAY AFTER THEY'VE BEEN ROLE THEY COULD BE IT BENEFICIAL. BUT OFTENTIMES THE PRE PLANNING FOR WHO'S COMING IS ALSO IMPORTANT OF BECAUSE IF YOU GET STUDENTS WHO HAVE CERTAIN NEEDS. LASTING WANT DO IS F. I'M AS NEEDS OUT IN IN WEEK FIVE OF THE SCHOOL WHEN WITH WE FOUND AND WEEK ONE YOU MAY PUT TOGETHER DIFFERENT KIND OF. OF THE STUDY GROUPS OR OR RESOURCE IS A WHATEVER TO HELP STUDENTS TO BE SUCCESSFUL. SO I WOULD HOPE THAT IN IN THE SCRUBBING OF THE APPLICATIONS IN THE ASSESSMENT WE WOULD GET TO THE THINGS THAT I REALLY CENTRAL BUT NOT ENOUGH SO HE THOUGHT THE BABY WITH THE BATHWATER BECAUSE WE MAY BE ELIMINATING. THE OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME SERVICES THAT STUDENTS WOULD WOULD GET AS A RESULT OF THE DATA. AND APPLICATIONS THEMSELVES ALWAYS DIFFICULT I HATE FILLING THEM OUT BUT. SO THOSE THINGS YOU HAVE TO DO BUT I APPRECIATE BRING IT TO OUR ATTENTION AND THE I HOPE THE PROCESS THAT THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WILL BE LOOKING AT. IT'LL EN I ALWAYS LOVE SITTING BY HER TOCHTER WEBER SHE ALWAYS HAS SO MUCH INSIGHT WHAT THE DATA BUT ON THIS I THINK IT'S. IN THE CLIMATE WE ARE IN A WHEN IT COMES TO APPLICATIONS WHETHER THEY BE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE UP FILLING OUT UP FAST OF FORUMS ALL OF THESE OTHER TYPES OF FORUMS. I THINK THERE IS SOME FEAR RELATED TO AND SO A FEW OF THOSE QUESTIONS THAT YOU KNOW YOU STARTLE YOU KNOW IF THEY WORKED IN AGRICULTURE I MEAN. THAT DOES SEEM LIKE IT'S LEANING TOWARDS A CERTAIN TYPE OF A. BIAS OR MAYBE IT ISN'T BABY IS ACTUALLY GOING TO. USE THE INFORMATION TO GET THEM EXTRA SUPPORT BUT I GUESS THE NEXT QUESTION WOULD BE IS WHAT ARE THEY GOING TO DO WITH THE INFORMATION AND WHAT DO YOU DO WITH THAT INFORMATION. AT THE. THANK YOU WANT TO RESPOND. I THINK WE HAD YOU KNOW ONE OF THE THAT I THINK I THINK YOU MAKE EXCELLENT POINTS AND. WE THINK THE INTENT OF COLLEGES THROUGHOUT THE STATE IS NOT TO LOSE THIS IMPORTANT DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION THAT CAN HELP US REALLY SHAPE STUDENT SERVICES. BUT IT'S REALLY ENSURING THAT. WE INSIST THAT STUDENTS DO CONTINUE TO APPLY AND THEN DO YOU CONSIDER IT. AND A THOROUGH OVER AND THOUGHTFUL REVIEW THAT MAYBE HAS STUDENTS THAT LOOKED THROUGH IT AND FIGURE OUT YOU KNOW WHERE. QUESTIONS ARE NOT CRAFTED IN A WAY THAT REALLY MAKES SENSE TO THEM I THINK IT'S JUST TIME TO LOOK AT THAT ON. AND AND AND ALSO TO TO REVIEW THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S INCORPORATED AND THOSE THOSE ARE THOUGHTFUL APPROACHES THAT I THINK WE OWE TO ALL OF OUR STUDENTS. PIC MS CUTTY WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN THANK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR YOUR VERY THOUGHTFUL COMMENTS THAT I ALSO VOWED TO SHARE IN TERMS OF HOW WE MOVE FORWARD FOR SOMETHING THAT IS MORE WORKABLE FOR STUDENTS.

REGARDING SERVICE CONTRACTS FOR THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I LIKE TO SAY THAT I AGREE TO THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING PLACING THE INDIVIDUAL WORKERS NAMES WITH THE UNIQUE IDENTIFIER. BUT WE WANT TO KEEP BUT WE ALSO WANT TO KEEP HOWEVER THE UC PENALTY ASPECT THAT HAS BEEN REQUESTED FOR AMENDMENT. I'M GRATEFUL TO THE CHAIR AND COMMITTEE FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS AND WE'RE WORKING TO REFINE THE THE LANGUAGE AROUND THIS PARTICULAR POINT. I WE WILL WE WILL KEEP THE COMMITTEES INFORMED AS TO UP WHEN WE MOVE FORWARD IN WELCOME THEIR INPUT. AND THISIS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU HEARD THIS ISSUE BEFORE YOU NO LESS THAN THREE BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED BY THIS COMMITTEE ON THE TOPIC OF YOU SEE OUTSOURCING. CONTRACTS WHAT IS DIFFERENT ABOUT THE REAL BEFORE YOU IS THAT NOW WE HAVE A STATE AUDIT THAT ECHOES MANY OF OUR CONCERNS. MORE THAN A MORE THAN THAT MORE THAN ABOUT THAT LATER HOWEVER THIS IS WHAT WE WANT AND WE. THIS IS WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT TEMPORARY WORKERS. THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO BE AN IMMIGRANT OR PERSON OF COLOR. THE ERNIE LOW WAGES WITH FEWER IF NO BENEFITS THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THEY'RE MORE LIKELY TO RELY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. THE QUESTION ONCE AGAIN BEFORE THE LEGISLATURE IS ONE OF THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA'S CONTRACTING PRACTICES ARE CONDEMNING LOW WAGE EMPLOYEES TO POVERTY. AND THE RELIANCE ON TAXPAYER FUNDED SOCIAL SERVICES. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT THERE IS NO WAY OF KNOWING BECAUSE THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA DOESN'T KEEP TRACK. SO WE'RE PROVIDING A MECHANISM FOR TRANSPARENCY. VENDORS ARE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT EACH EMPLOYEE'S PAY AND BENEFITS TO THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA CHANCES OFFICE. THE JUSTICE OFFICE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO POST THIS INFORMATION ON A PUBLIC ACCESSIBLE WEBSITE. IF THE VENDOR FAILS TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION THEY WOULD NOT BE ELIGIBLE TO CONTRACT WITH THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA UP TO FIVE YEARS. IF THE UNIVERSE OF CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO CONTRACT WOULD VENDORS WHO ARE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENT OF THIS BILL THE LEGISLATIVE WILL DEDUCT THE LEGISLATURE WILL DEDUCT THE AMOUNT OF THE CONTRACT. FROM THEIR BUDGET ALLOCATION THIS WILL PROVIDE TRANSPARENCY REGARDING CONTRACTORS PAY COMPARED TO UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES DOING COMPARABLE WORK. IT WILL PROVIDE CLARITY ABOUT WHETHER THE UNIVERSITY IS ENFORCING ITS OWN MINIMAL WAGE POLICIES AND WHETHER THESE EMPLOYEES RECEIVE AT ANY HEALTH OR RETIREMENT BENEFITS. AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE WILL ALSO ALLOW THE LAWMAKERS TO GAZE THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE CONTRACTS SHIP COSTS WHO STATE BY THESE EMPLOYEES HAVING TO RELY ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE. HERE WITH ME TODAY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS CLAUDIA PREPARA FROM ASKED ME LOCAL THIRTY TWO NINETY NINE. AND TAMIRA ARE GETTING A FORMER WORKER WITH THE UC CONTRACTOR. I ALSO HAVE JULIE WHAT WATERS WITH ISSUE FROM ASK ME FOR TECHNICAL SINCE. YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS CLAUDIA FOR PRADA AND I'M THE RESEARCH DIRECTOR FOR ASKED ME THIRTY TO NINETY NINE THE LARGEST UNION. AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA OF REPRESENTING TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND SERVICE IN PATIENT CARE TECHNICAL WORKERS I THANK. DOCTOR WEBER FOR HER SPONSORSHIP OF THIS BILL AND THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY IN FRONT OF YOU TODAY. I'M HERE TO REGISTER THE UNION SUPPORT FOR A BI TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE WHICH QUITE SIMPLY REQUEST AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MAINTAIN A PUBLICLY ACCESSIBLE DATABASE OF ITS SERVICE CONTRACTORS. THE INTO OF THE LEGISLATION IS TWOFOLD FIRST PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE A VEHICLE TO MONITOR UC'S PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING THE STATE AUDITOR'S CRITICISMS. OF ITS CONTRACTING OUT PRACTICES AND SECOND CONFIRMED THE EXTENT OF UC'S USE OF LOW WAGE CONTRACTORS. LAST YEAR THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT YOU SEE CONTRACTING OUT RESULTS NOT JUST IN THE DISPLACEMENT BUT ALSO IN THE AVOIDANCE OF HIRING YOU SEE SERVICE WORKERS. YOU SEE CONTRACTORS ARE PAID UP TO EIGHT DOLLARS AND FIFTY CENTS LESS THAN YOU SEE SERVICE WORKERS JUNE COMPARABLE WORK. UC'S OUTSOURCING OF SERVICE WORK IS NOT JUST TEMPORARY I'M ADDITIONAL YOU SEE DOES NOT ADEQUATELY MEASURE SUPPOSE THAT COST SAVINGS OR EFFICIENCIES RESULTING FROM THE OUTSOURCING. AND USE YOUR NEWS CONTRACTS REPEATEDLY OFTEN WITHOUT HEARING TO COMPETITIVE BIDDING REQUIREMENTS. THE INFORMATION PROVIDED UNDER AB TWENTY THREE SIXTY ONE WOULD PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND OTHER INTERESTED STAKEHOLDERS THE ABILITY TO MONITOR UC'S PROGRESS IN ADDRESSING. THE AUDITOR'S CONCERNS THE UNIVERSITY WOULD BE AFFECTED. ONLY IF IT FAILS TO PROVIDE THE CONTRACTOR DATA OR FAILS TO DECLARE AN UNCOOPERATIVE CONTRACTOR AN UNQUALIFIED BITTER FOR FUTURE WORK IN OTHER WORDS. YOU SEE CAN AVOID CONSEQUENCE BY TAKING SIMPLE AND REASONABLE STEPS. LASTLY THE UNIONS RECENT REPORT FINDS THAT THE AVERAGE STARTING PAY FOR LATINO AND BLACK WORKERS AND AFTER REPRESENTED TITLES IS AT LEAST TWENTY PERCENT LOWER THAN WHITE WORKERS. AND THAT THE NUMBER OF BLACK WORKERS THAT YOU SEE HAS DECREASED BY THIRTY SEVEN PERCENT. SINCE NINETEEN NINETY SIX WHILE CONTRACTOR SURVEYS SUGGEST OUTSOURCED CONTRACTORS ARE MORE LIKELY TO BE BLACK. THEN YOU SEE SERVICE WORKERS. AS A THIRD LARGEST EMPLOYER IN THE STATE YOU SEE AS A DRIVER BOTH SOCIAL MOBILITY AND EQUALITY THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. ITS EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES HAVE IMPLICATIONS NOT JUST FOR THE UNIVERSITY BUT FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. THEREFORE SHINING A LIGHT ON ITS CONTRACTING OUT PRACTICES IS A MATTER OF STATEWIDE CONCERN. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MY. MY NAME IS TOM LITTLE GET OUT I WHAT CA AS A BODY. AT UCLA FOR ALMOST THIRTY YEARS. MANY OF MY COWORKERS HAD BEEN WORKING AT UCLA SCENES THE HOSPITAL. OPENED TEN YEARS AGO WE WHAT COULD REPLACE HEAVING PATIENT US AND IS IT FARMING THESE. ARE THE HOST BATON BLOWS OUT THE EMERGENCY. SIDE US WITH US THE MEAN IN TORRANCE TO THE HOSPITAL. WHEN I STARTED WORK AT THE BODY OF THE UCLA I MEET THE MINIMUM WAGE. UP UNTIL A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO. I MADE JUST TEN DOUGHNUTS AND FIFTY CENT PER HOUR. WHERE US UCLA WHAT CUTS DOING THE SAME WORK? WOULD MAKE. FROM EIGHTEEN UP TO TWENTY CITY ON HOWARD'S. WITH A FULL BENEFIT BUT. ONLY AFTER TOM OFF MIKE COWORKERS SPOKE UP DID WE EVER EVEN RECEIVE THE FOURTEEN DOLLARS UC MINIMUM. ALL THE WORKING CONDITIONS ARE SUBCONTRACTORS EMPLOYEES IN THE HOSPITAL WITH ALSO DIFFICULT'S FOR EXAMPLE. THE AIR QUALITY IS IN THE PARKING STRUCTURE IS VERY. POR. SOMETIMES THE PETITION IN THE AIR SO BAD THAT IS HARD TO TO BREEZE AND TO SOME OF OUR COWORKERS HOP BEING. FAINTED WIDE WORKING. DOWNSTAIRS. THIS WHERE IT WOULD BE. BACK UP DOWN THE STAIRS AND YET WE WERE TOLD TO CONTINUE. OUT OF WHAT CAN. SUDDENLY MANY OF MY COWORKERS HAVE DEVELOPED PUT ASTHMA AND OTHERS EXPLANATORY PROBLEMS. SCENES WORKING US QUATTROPORTE CUTS OF THE UC IN NAME. SO WHEN WE WE HAD THAT YOU SEE TODAY WAS TAKING OVER OPERATIONS OVER THE VIOLATE WE WILL HOPEFULLY THAT WE WOULD FINALLY GET A CHANCE AT A BETTER JOB. AND A DECENT FUTURE. FOR ME HAVING A KID DROP AT UCLA WOULD MEAN. I COULD FIND NINETY PROVIDE A SECURE LIFE FOR MY FAMILY MY WIFE AND MY SON. EXECUTE DROP AT UCLA WOULD MEAN THAT I WOULD BE ABLE TO RETIRE ONE DAY. IT WOULD MEAN THAT WE WOULD BE RECOGNIZED FOR THE SIDE OF THE SET WE PROVIDE. FOR THE PATIENT BECAUSE OF THE UCLA MEDICAL CENTER. BUT UNFORTUNATELY UTILITY HARD TO DECIDE TWO DATES MOST OF US GO OUT. WITHOUT GIVING IT CREDIT FOR OUR PRICELESS CONTRIBUTIONS. THEY WANT TO REPLACE US WITH A STUDENT WHAT CUT WHAT COULD WHAT KIND OR CUTS. PULL THE ECONOMY CONTINUAL TO PAY LESS WITH NO BENEFITS. YOU SAID THERE WAS HAPPY TO HAVE US TO DO THE WORK. WHEN THEY COULD PAY US THE MINIMUM WAGE BUT. NOW. THEY HAVE TO GIVE US A DECENT JOB THEY SAY THEY DO NOT NEED US ANYMORE. I LOVE MY JOB AT UCLA AND I TOOK PRIDE IN PROVIDING EXCELLENT SERVICE TO THE PATIENTS AND THEIR. FAMILIES MY COWORKERS AND I SORT OF IT THE PATIENTS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR YEARS AND ALL OF US DESERVED TO STAY. YOU SEE AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH. FOR. SHEDDING MY QUOTA.

GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN VERS JASON MURPHY ON BEHALF UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA WE DO NOT HAVE A POSITION ON THIS BILL AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER WE DO WANT TO RISE TODAY TO SHARE OUR CONCERNS WITH THE MEASURE. I GUESS I JUST PUT IT SIMPLY WE DO NOT BELIEVE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH THIS BILL WITH RESPECT TO THE WAGE AND. INFORMATION DATA THIS REQUEST OF OUR VENDORS WE'VE LEARNED OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS AS MISSILE AND WEBER WAS THAT THE TESTING TO WITH THE. CONVERSATIONS AROUND THE LARA BILLS THAT IS THEY THEY WERE NOT TO BE ABLE TO GET OURSELVES UP AVAILABLE TO OUR VENDORS AYE IN MANY CASES VIEW THAT INFORMATION IS PROPRIETARY. AND. WOULD NOT BELIEVABLE SKIN SECURE THAT LETS THAT INFORMATION WHICH IN TURN WILL FIND OURSELVES WILL FIND OURSELVES OUT OF COMPLIANCE THE BILL WITH RESPECT TO. OUR VENDOR SUPPLYING IT AND POTENTIAL IMPACTS TO THE UNIVERSITY BASED BUDGET SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONCERNS WE WE FINALLY WE BELIEVE THIS IS ESSENTIALLY A. DE FACTO WAY TO LIMIT THE VERSES ABILITY TO OUR CONTRACT OUT EFFECTIVELY THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANY WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. THE BILL. ANY QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. AFTER LOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH RESEARCH AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS SAY IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE. AND TO THE TESTIMONY BECAUSE I THINK IT IS IMPORTANT TO HAVE ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENCY FOR THE VALUES THAT WE AS A PUBLIC INSTITUTION HAVE. IN SERVING A STUDENTS AND THE ECOSYSTEM AND SO WE NEED TO LEAD WITH THAT BUT HAVING SAID THAT I DID. HAVE A QUESTION AND APOLOGIES IF I MISSED IT. BUT THE A A NOTED ANALYSIS WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS. OF FOR EXAMPLE WITH THE. OF FALSIFICATION PERHAPS ISSUE THE CONTRACTOR FAILED TO PROVIDE INFORMATION IS REQUIRED I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE AUTHOR WAS STILL OPENS UP TO THE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS AS LISTED ANALYSIS. I THINK. YEAH WE WERE OPEN TO IT YEAH WERE STILL LOOKING AT THAT YEAH BUT SO IT MIGHT UNDERSTAND THAT. THE AUTHOR HAS ACCEPTED THE COMMITTEES AMENDMENTS AS PRESENTED. THAT NO NOT AT THEIR PRESENT WE ARE CONTINUING TO WORK ON THAT BECAUSE ONE OF THE REALITIES IS IS THAT. THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THE STATE. IS SUCH AS A IS OF SUCH THAT THE ONLY LEVERAGE YOU HAVE TO GET COMPLIANCE. IF THE MONEY. THAT THAT'S THE ONLY LEVERAGE WE HAVE EVERYTHING YOU KNOW EVEN BILLS THAT WE RIGHT ALL SUGGESTIONS. WE SUGGEST THIS WITH ITS IT CURRICULUM OF WHETHER IT'S POLICY OR WHATEVER IT MAY BE IF IT'S ALL SUGGESTIONS SO THE ONLY THE ONLY ABILITY WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT. OUR WISHES ARE KNOWN AS WE KNOW IS REALLY THROUGH THE BUDGET WE DO THAT IN TERMS OF. STUDENT INVOLVEMENT. THAT SELL YOU KNOW WE WANT INCREASED INVOLVEMENT ONLY WAY WE CAN DO IT IS BY. BUT GETTING AN AGREEMENT TO THE BUDGET TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO OF WE'RE LOOKING MORE INTO TO SEE HOW WE CAN REFINE IT BUT UP. WE WANT ACCOUNTABILITY WE WANT TO CA AND THE ONLY WAY TO GET COUNT ABILITY BASICALLY IS TO. SAY THAT IF YOU'RE NOT GOING TO COMPLY WHAT SHOULD WE BE CONTRACTING OUT. SO. SO CAN YOU HELP ME OF BEST UNDERSTAND THEN BECAUSE I AYE BUT I'M HEARING IS THAT YOU AGREE WITH. THE ANALYSIS WITH EFFECTIVE IT THAT YOU AMENDMENTS. MOVING FORWARD BUT PROCESS WISE STATE YOU WAS ON IT I THINK WE MIGHT MENTION THAT WE AGREED WITH ONE OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS NOT THAT THEIR LIVES THE WHAT WE ARE. WHAT IT AYE AYE SAID THE BEGINNING? WHERE MY? THAT WE AGREED WITH ONE OF THOSE WHICH IS NOT PUTTING UP PEOPLE'S NAMES OF THAT'S THERE BUT WE DID NOT AGREE TO THAT. TO TAKE AWAY THE PENALTY. FOR NON COMPLIANCE. HEY I THINK ARE. I DIDN'T MISS RIVER MAYBE TO SOME CLARIFICATION OF AYE MY TWO BEST UNDERSTAND. THE ALL THE OTHERS DESIRE. WITH RESPECT TO THE AMENDMENTS THAT HAVE BEEN NOTED ANALYSIS ON A PAGE FOR A PEACEFUL. SO IT. ON PAGE FOUR. WE KNOW IT'S AN UNDER RECOMMENDATIONS. IT IT IT IT. BUT NOT WITH THE AUTHOR WITH INSTEAD OF TO THE CHAIR. THAT TO BEST UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS EXACTLY. THE BILL IS BEING PRESENTED AS IS WITHOUT ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE'S MANDATE IS THAT IS THAT WHAT INVEST IS THAT WHAT I UNDERSTOOD IT TO AMENDMENTS YEAH OKAY. YES SO THAT OTHER AUTHOR IS CREDITED ACCEPTING ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS BUT NOT THAT THE SECOND. RIGHT AS LISTED NUMBER AS LISTED NUMBER TWO IS THAT RIGHT SO YOU. THOSE ARE YOU'RE ACCEPTING. AMENDMENT NUMBER ONE IT LISTED ON PAGE FOUR. AND THEN. ACRYLIC IS CURRENTLY TO THE CLIMBING ON US ON PAGE FIVE THE SECOND MEMBERS IS THAT ACCURATE RIGHT THERE. JUST. DOCTOR WEBER. TRY TO BE BETTER THAN WHAT THAT WANTED TO LISTEN AND WALDRON BANK THAT THE SAME ONES LISTA. AMENDMENT WIND. SECTION NINE TWO OH SIX TWO. TO READ. UNIQUE INDIVIDUAL IDENTIFIER. YES. AND WE'VE AGREED TO THAT. WE'VE AGREED TO THAT. AND NUMBER TO AMEND SECTION NINE TWO. ZERO SIX TWO. THE UNIVERSITY SHALL SUBSTITUTE A UNIQUE IDENTIFIER IN PLACE OF THAT INDIVIDUAL NAME MOVEMENT. ALSO BEEN AGREED TO IT WE'VE AGREED ON THOSE TO YES BRIGHTON. YES WE'VE AGREED TO THOSE TWO THAT DEAL WITH THE UNIQUE IDENTIFIER AND THE NAMES. BUT BUT GOT THEM FORCE THAT LANGUAGE THAT THE. NOT OKAY. LET. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH OKAY. ANY OTHER QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. DR WEBER WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE. YES I'D I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO ARE HERE TODAY AND FOR THOSE WHO HAD QUESTIONS A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA'S WHO KNOWS ONE OF OUR LARGEST EMPLOYEES IN THE STATE. AND WHAT THEY DO WILL HAVE A HUGE IMPACT UPON US STATEWIDE EMPLOYMENT AS WELL AS THE ISSUE POVERTY IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN WORKING TO ALLEVIATE POLICY PROPERTY FROM THE NUMBER OF WITH A NUMBER OF MEASURES INCLUDING THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT BRAKES FOR WORKING FAMILIES. AND A FIFTEEN DOLLAR MINIMUM WAGE. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WHEN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA COMES AS THE ALLOCATIONS FOR THESE CONTRACTS THAT THEY TOO ARE ARE OF THAT WE'RE VOTING NOT TO REVERSE OUR EFFORTS BUT TO UPLIFT THE EFFORTS OF CALIFORNIANS. WITH REGARD TO THE ECONOMY AND THAT THEY TOUR ARE BUYING INTO THE FLOSS MOVIE HAPPY ABOUT REDUCING POVERTY AND PAYING AT LEAST AT A MINIMUM WAGE OF FIFTEEN DOLLARS AN HOUR. WE NEED TO KNOW THAT WHETHER WE ARE PAYING TO KEEP THOUSANDS OF WORKERS IN POVERTY AND LINE UP ON PUBLIC ASSISTANCE AB TWENTY SIXTY ONE WILL GIVE US THE TRANSPARENCY WE NEED TO FULLY UNDERSTAND. HOW THESE OUTSOURCING CONTRACTS AFFECT CALIFORNIA WORKERS HOW ALSO FIND IT INCREDIBLE AND SOMEWHAT UNBELIEVABLE THAT THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA HAS NO MECHANISM FOR MAINTAINING DATA AND INFORMATION I MEAN THEY ARE THE? THE PREMIER RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS OF THE OF THE NATION AND THE WORLD AND IT'S FIND I FIND IT INCONCEIVABLE THAT THEY WOULD NOT BE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA FROM THEIR VENDORS. AND KNOWING WHAT THEY'VE BEEN DOES HAVE DONE AND AND COMPLIANCE WITH A CERTAIN KINDS OF OF RULES AND REGULATIONS EVEN SMALL CITIES. OTHER PLACES ARE ABLE TO WHEN THEY DEAL WITH EEOC AND OTHER KINDS OF THINGS ARE ABLE TO COLLECT DATA CONCERNING THEIR CONTRACTORS VENDORS AND THE COMPOSITION OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS. SO I AYE BELIEVING IN THE IN THE WHAT I WOULD CONSULT CONSIDERED TO BE ALMOST THE LIMITLESS POWER OF THE RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA. I BELIEVE THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE US WITH THE DATA WE NEED FROM THEIR VENDORS TO ENGAGE IN THE CONTRACTS OF THEIR EYES RESPECTFULLY ASK BUT I'D VOTE FOR THIS PARTICULAR BILL. I I WOULD ENTERTAIN A MOTION. SO MOVED BY MISTER SANTIAGO SECOND BY MISS QUIRK SILVA. AND. WE TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES. SITTING IN AN SUB TO. COMMITTEE. A TODAY LOOKING AT THE. BUDGET OF YOU SEE. I I WILL REITERATE AND. THAT GO. DOCTOR WEBER'S COMMENTS THAT WHEN IT COMES TO COST SAVINGS. AS WE LOOK AT THE BUDGET. AND AS WE LOOK AT UC. I WOULD JUST REPEATAGAIN I THINK WHAT I SAID WHEN THESE BILLS FIRST CAME THROUGH AS. A MISTER SENATOR LARA'S BILL THAT YOU SEE CANNOT. WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE MUCH SAVINGS AND. IN THE UC BUDGET. IF WE LOOK AT THAT SAVINGS AT THE BOTTOM. THAT IT WOULD TAKE TREMENDOUS AMOUNTS AND MAYBE THAT'S WHAT WE ARE SEEING. WHEN WE SEE OUTSOURCING OF JOBS. UNDERCUTTING OF WORKERS A AND AND OUTSOURCING SO I I WOULD AGAIN CALLING YOU SEE TO LOOK AT THAT. THEIR POLICIES. SO AYE THANK DOCTOR WEBER FOR BRINGING THE BILL FORWARD. BUT I DO HAVE. SOME CURRENT CONCERNS AZZA POINTED OUT BY. MR LOW THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE LEGISLATURE'S HANDS BEING TIED. A IN THE IN THE FUTURE BUDGET YEARS BASED ON A INFORMATION FROM A THIRD PARTY.

ENROLLED AT THE HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE FOR. THE DUAL ENROLLMENT IN LOS ANGELES NEARLY TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS. A YEAR GRADUATE FROM PRIVATE SCHOOLS. MANY OF THE STUDENTS COME TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND ALL WHILE THEY'RE IN HIGH SCHOOL ARE ELIGIBLE FOR CONCURRENT ENROLLMENT.

I THINK IMAGE TRAMP MUCH APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THE AB TWENTY FIVE A FIVE. PART WAS SIMPLY ASK THE CSU REPORT THE LEGISLATURE ON IT LEGISLATURE ON IT'S A BUDGET AND PRACTICES SPECIFIC TO IT'S A STATE SPENDING. I A RECENTLY AUDITOR'S REPORT FOUND THE CAMPUS IS DO NOT ADEQUATELY OVERSEE THEIR BUDGETS SPECIFICALLY CAMPUS IS NOT HAVE WRITTEN POLICIES REQUIRING PERIODIC. COMPARISONS OF SPENDING LEVELS TO ITS BUDGET LIMITS. I AM IN FACT A LAST YEAR THE CSU. A BOARD OF TRUSTEES VOTED TO INCREASE THEIR THEIR TUITION IS ON TRACK TO DO THE SAME THING CITING MORE THAN EVER TODAY. IT WOULD BE PRUDENT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THE WITH AN AUDIT OTHER WOULD HELP US TO IDENTIFY A COST SAVINGS POTENTIALLY. AND THE. PREVENTING STUDENTS FROM AGAIN TUITION HIKES IF WE COULD POTENTIALLY DO THAT. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTES AND THAT HAVE ONE WITNESS. TWO WITNESSES. THAT BACKWARDS. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN DENY MARIO GUERRERO ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA FACULTY ASSOCIATION. WITH ONE I THINK. AS THE MEMBER. SANTIAGO FOR. PUTTING THIS FORWARD I SEE IF A REPRESENTS TWENTY THOUSAND FACULTY LIBRARIANS COACHES AND CANCERS IN THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY SYSTEM. A SYSTEM WHICH SERVES MORE THAN FOUR HUNDRED SEVENTY THOUSAND STUDENTS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. ARE A COUPLE REASONS WHY WE NEED THIS BILL. ARE AS JUST MENTIONED THERE IS AN AUDIT HEARING OF THIS YES YOU WERE MANY THERE WERE MANY MAJOR FINDINGS WERE DISCUSSED IT WAS FOUND ONE OF THOSE FINDINGS WAS THAT THE CSU WAS NOT DOING. PERIODIC REVIEWS OF THE CAMPUS BUDGETS I BELIEVE THAT WE BELIEVE THAT A REGULAR AUDIT WILL ENSURE THAT THE CSU FULLY IMPLEMENTS UP PROPER OR FISCAL OVERSIGHT. AND THAT THEY AND THAT THIS WILL REQUIRE THE CSU TO PUT IN PLACE GOOD BUDGET PROCESS SEES AS WELL AS ALLOW THE PUBLIC IN THE LEGISLATURE TO BE. FULLY AWARE OF THESE CHANGES AT THE SAME HEARING THE CSU WAS ALSO ASKED HOW THEY MAKE HIRING DECISIONS THE CSU'S RESPONSE WITH THE COMPASS THAT CAMPUSES MAKE HIRING DECISIONS. ARE ONE POSITION AT A TIME. AT THIS I THINK HEARING IT WAS DISCUSSED THAT THERE WERE MAJOR INCREASES IN EXECUTIVE AND MANAGEMENT POSITIONS. THIS BILL WOULD REQUIRE THE CSU TO RIVER REVIEW THEIR CURRENT HIRING PRACTICES AND COMPARE THEM TO THE UC AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND FINALLY COME BACK. OUT TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH PROPOSED CHANGES TO IMPROVING THOSE PRACTICES. ADDITIONALLY LEGISLATURE LEGISLATORS HAVE ASKED US FOR THE NUMBER OF QUALIFIED STUDENTS THAT WERE NOT ADMITTED INTO THE CSU THEY HAVE ASKED US FOR INFORMATION INFORMATION SUCH AS WHERE THE STUDENTS APPLIED FROM. WHERE THEY APPLY TO YOU AND OTHER DEMOGRAPHIC INFORMATION ABOUT THEM WHILE THE CSU MAY HAVE THE NUMBER THEY DO NOT PROVIDE? THIS IN FOR THIS AND OTHER INFORMATION WE BELIEVE THAT LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC SHOULD HAVE THIS. I CLOSING GOVERNOR BROWN ARE RECENTLY SAID THAT THE CSU HAS TO LEARN TO LIVE WITHIN THEIR MEANS WHILE WE MAY NOT AGREE WITH THE UNDERLYING ISSUE OF. FUNDING THAT PROMPTED THAT STATEMENT BECAUSE. THE SYSTEM IS IN FACT UNDER FUNDED WE DO BELIEVE THAT. YES YES YOU MUST BE MORE TRENT IF MORE TRANSPARENT SYSTEM ALLOWING LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC TO KNOW MORE ABOUT HOW THE CSU SPENDS ITS FUNDS. WILL ALLOW LEGISLATORS AND THE PUBLIC TO HOLD THE SYSTEM MORE ACCOUNTABLE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND WE ASK FOR YOUR IBOOK. CHIP MEDINA MEMBERS SAID DAVID BELL HAWKINS WITH THE CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY EMPLOYEES UNION. TH THANK YOU MISTER SANTIAGO HURT AUTHORING THIS BILL WE HAVE WORKED WITH DOCTOR WEBER LAST YEAR. I'M ON THE A PAYROLL. RELEASE OF THE APRIL TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NOT AT THAT LOOKED AT HER MANAGEMENT GROWTH AS WELL AS BUDGET ACCOUNTABILITY AT SEARS YOU CAMPUSES. WE BELIEVE THAT THE LEGISLATION AND I NOT ONLY ADDRESSES THE SCOPE OF BUT MORE IMPORTANT IN SOME WAYS IS THE INTENT OF THAT ON IT. A WONDER THE MORE DISTURBING CONCLUSIONS OF THE AUDITOR. WAS THAT STE. SEE IF YOU CAN'T PURPOSES WERE UNABLE TO DOCUMENT TO THE AUDITOR HOW THEY SPEND STATE MONEY. UNABLE TO DOCUMENT TO THE AUDITOR HOW THEY SPEND STATE MONEY THERE BY QUESTIONING WHETHER THEY'RE DOING IT EFFICIENTLY AND APPROPRIATELY AS POINTED OUT IN EUROPE ANALYSIS. I WOULD THINK THAT SEE IF YOU WOULD WELCOME THIS BILL. BECAUSE IT'S CLEAR FROM WHAT WE HAVE SEEN. ARE FROM FROM THE ARCTIC CONCLUSIONS. FROM THE. THE ENQUIRIES HAVE BEEN MADE BY MR SANTIAGO AND OTHERS. I THAT THERE IS A. INABILITY. OF THE CSU IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED TO HAVE THEIR BUDGET. HELD ACCOUNTABLE.

PROCESS HAMPER THAT PROCESS WE HAVE MET. ALMOST ALL OF THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AUDIT. OF ALL THE FIGHTING THE AUDIT THEIR COUPLE STRINGERS OUT THERE THAT OUT LYING BECAUSE OF. TECHNOLOGY IMPROVEMENTS OPTICAL TIME TO TO IMPLEMENT. AND BECAUSE OF A LABOR NEGOTIATION PROCESS THAT HAS GONE THROUGH THE PROCESS. A ADDITIONALLY WE PROVIDE THE LEGISLATURE AND THE GOVERNOR. NUMEROUS REPORTS SOME OF THESE REPORTS ARE ARE DUPLICATIVE OF WHAT'S REQUIRED IN THIS BILL AS WELL. AND THE REASON WHY REST REPOSE IS BECAUSE OF THE ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS AUDITING. CLEARLY WE HAVE REPORTED TO THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE BUDGET PROCESS. POOR LEGISLATIVE MANDATE. AND WE HAVE MET THE TARGETS OF THE AUDIT REQUEST. SO FAR AND BECAUSE THAT WE JUST WE JUST DON'T SEE WHY THIS BUILD MERITED. AYE WITH ME TODAY'S BRAD WELL SOCIALIZED CHANCELLOR THE CSU AS WELL. MAINTENANCE OF TIME I WON'T. READ THE STATEMENT BUT JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE AUDIT MADE THIRTEEN RECOMMENDATIONS WE'VE COMPLIED WITH TEN OF THE THIRTEEN IS ANDY MENTIONED THREE OF THEM. HAVE LONGER IMPLEMENTATION TYLER TIMELINES SPECIFICALLY THE STATE AUDITOR'S ALREADY ACCEPTED OUR RESPONSES WITH REGARD TO THE BUDGET OVERSIGHT. WHICH WAS RAISED BY EARLIER IN THE DISCUSSION. AND WE'VE SINCE IMPLEMENTED THAT PROVIDES POLICY ALSO AND POINT OUT THAT THE AUDITORS DID I DID NOT FIND ANY CAMPUS THAT OVERSPENT ITS BUDGET BUT RATHER DIDN'T HAVE ADEQUATE POLICIES IN THE AUDITOR'S OPINION WE'VE RECTIFIED THAT WE BELIEVE. SO THAT THAT SO. SHOULD SUFFICE TERMS OF THE UP BUDGET OVERSIGHT ISSUE. THANK YOU ANY OTHER WITNESSES AND OPPOSITION. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE.

AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY THREE WOULD REQUIRE COUNTIES TO DESIGNATE. A HIGHER EDUCATION LIAISON WITHIN THE WELFARE DEPARTMENTS AT A PUT. AS A POINT OF CONTACT. THE GOAL ISN'T IS TO IMPROVE. COORDINATION WITH COUNTIES ON LINKING ALL COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. TO PUBLICLY FUNDED SERVICES. STATISTICS HAVE HIGHLIGHTED STRUGGLES. FACED BY MANY STUDENTS TODAY A INCLUDING DIVERSE AND OFTEN. LOW INCOME STUDENTS STUDENTS. THIRTY SIX PERCENT OF COLLEGE STUDENTS SAY THAT THEY ARE FOOD INSECURE. AND HOUSING INSECURE ONE NINE PERCENT REPORT BEING HOMELESS. I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. IS SENT VIA MOSQUEDA. EL CAMINO COMMUNITY COLLEGE COUNSELOR WITH WHOM THE BILL IDEA. CAME FROM AND ALSO REBEKAH GONZALEZ FROM THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKERS CALIFORNIA CHAPTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AGAIN MY NAME IS CYNTHIA MUSCAT I AM I'M A COUNSELOR AT ALL COMMUNICABLE ITCH AND I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE BILL'S SPONSOR AS WELL AS THE FACULTY ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. IN MY PROFESSIONAL LIFE BESIDES BE ACCOUNTS ARE MOST OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE FIRST YEAR EXPERIENCE PROGRAM. AS A AS AN ACADEMIC COUNSELLOR ON STUDENTS ARE INCREASINGLY SHARING THEIR LIFE CIRCUMSTANCES THAT INTEL SUCH ISSUES OF POVERTY. HOMELESSNESS FOOD INSECURITY MENTAL ILLNESS AND DOMESTIC VIOLENCE IF I CAN IDENTIFY A STUDENT FOR ELIGIBLE CAMPUS SERVICES SUCH AS CAO WORKS YOU APPEAR YOU CAN ASK. OUR DEITY SBS I CAN QUICKLY REFER THEM THERE HOWEVER NOT ALL STUDENTS ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE PROGRAMS BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN THAT THEY AREN'T ELIGIBLE FOR OTHER PROGRAMS FUNDED ON THROUGH THE COUNTY. AYE MANY YEARS AGO I HAD A STUDENT WHO HAD BECOME EMANCIPATED FOSTER CARE YOUTH I REACHED OUT TO THE SERVICES MY COMMUNITY AND WITH THAT ABLE TO FIND HIM PERMANENT PLACEMENT. I I QUICKLY THOUGHT OF MY SISTER WHO IS AN MSW SOCIAL WORKER EMPLOYED BY THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES AND WITH IN MINUTES SHE HAD A REFERRAL FORM FOR ME WHICH IS EXACTLY WHAT MY STUDENT NEED IT. I'VE SPOKEN TO COUNTER THE UP AND DOWN THE STATE IN THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT MANY OF US SPACE. I'M NOT EVERYONE IS LUCKY ENOUGH TO HAVE A SISTER WHO WORKS FOR THE COUNTY. THAT'S HOW WE CAME UP WITH THE IDEA FOR AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY THREE TO ALLOW FOR A COUNTY LIAISON FOR HIGHER EDUCATION TO WORK TOGETHER WITH COUNCILS LIKE ME FOR THIS VERY PURPOSE. IT'S IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT WE HAVE SOME SUCCESSFUL MODELS OF COUNTIES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALREADY WORKING TOGETHER COLLABORATIVELY. PARTICULARLY IN ORANGE COUNTY WHERE THEY CAN OTHER COUNTY VOLUNTARY SET UP ITS VERY MODEL FOR THE CAL WORKS POPULATION. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY THREE WILL SCALE THIS UP AND WILL ULTIMATELY HELP CONNECT MORE STUDENTS WITH PROGRAMS AND SERVICES WHICH THEY MIGHT BE ELIGIBLE FOR THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS NSW WAS PLEASED TO CO SPONSOR AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY THREE AS A REFLECTS THE NEED FOR INCREASED COMMUNICATION AND DIALOGUE BETWEEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND COUNTIES ON SERVING THE STUDENT POPULATION. ONE APPROPRIATELY REFERRED TO THE RIGHT PROGRAMS AND SERVICES SOCIAL WORKERS WILL BE THE ONES WORKING WITH THE STUDENTS TO ADDRESS THEIR BASIC HUMAN NEEDS LIKE HOUSING. FOOD AND MENTAL HEALTH WHICH THEN INCREASES THE LIKELIHOOD OF THEM SUCCEEDING IN SCHOOL. THIS SPELL IT'S A WIN WIN FOR COUNTIES COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND STUDENTS AND DESERVES YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU.

THIS BILL WILL REMOVE THE SUNSET DATE AND PUBLIC CONTRACT CODE. ALLOWING THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES. TO USE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGY. INDEFINITELY. THIS ALLOWS THE UNIVERSITIES TO HAVE FLEXIBLE OPTIONS. ALLOWING THEM TO MAKE WISE PROCUREMENT COST SAVING DECISIONS. RATHER THAN HAVING TO SELECT THE LOWEST COST BETTER. THE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGY ALLOWS CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND UC TO CONSIDERED NON COST FACTORS SUCH AS QUALITY EXPERIENCE AND THE LIFE CYCLE COSTS WHEN SELECTING VENDORS. CURRENT LAW PURSUANT TO SENATE BILL TWELVE EIGHTY. AUTHORIZED THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN THE UC TO USE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT METHODOLOGY. ON A PILOT BASIS FOR FIVE YEARS. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE WAS REQUIRED TO REVIEW THE PILOT PROGRAM. BUT COULD NOT COMPLETE THE STUDY DURING THE ORIGINAL TIMEFRAME. A ONE YEAR EXTENSION WAS GRANTED IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN AND THE REPORT WAS ISSUED IN DECEMBER OF TWO THOUSAND. SEVENTEEN. THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE RECOGNIZE THAT THE UC MADE A REASONABLE USE. OF THE BEST VALUE PROCUREMENT AND RECOMMENDED THAT THEY BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE. IT'S USE WITH ME TODAY IS JASON MURPHY FROM THE UC OFFICE OF THE STATE GOVERNMENT RELATIONS. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JASON MURPHY BEHALF THE UNIVERSE TO CALIFORNIA.

AFTERNOON WAS THAT EVER AT ON BEHALF BE COLLEGE LEAGUE CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT. ADDITIONAL WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. WITNESSES IN OPPOSITION. AND ANYONE IN BETWEEN THERE YOU GO YOU'RE DOING THAT FOR EVERYBODY ELSE I THOUGHT I'D WAIT. I AM. MICROBES HERE ON BEHALF OF QUEST DIAGNOSTICS ON SO SO WE ARE WE'RE NOT IN SUPPORT WE'RE REALLY NINE IN OPPOSE THE THERE AND WHICH HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE BILL AND AND AND AND A PRIME ONE JUST MAKE IT CLEAR WHAT I REALLY APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S EFFORTS TO HELP. ME OUT WITH THIS I. AM ONE QUEST DIAGNOSTICS TESTIFIED IN BUDGET SUB TO LAST YEAR ON ON AN ISSUE INVOLVING. ON IN THE GEN DIS EASE ITEM INVOLVING A. THAT THE PUT POTENTIAL LOSS OF THE CONTRACT AT THE UCLA MEDICAL CENTER ON FROM MOVING WORK FROM THE SENATE THERE SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO LAB TO THE UNIT AT TO ADD. AN ENTITY CALLED A ARE YOU P. WHICH IS AN ARM OF THE UNIVERSITY OF UTAH. AND I TESTIFYING IN THAT HEARING AND AND THREE. IN THE END USE THAT IS THAT THEY MOVE THE WORK THEY MOVE THE CONTRACTED LABORATORY SERVICES FROM UCLA MEDICAL CENTER TO OUR DIFFERENT FROM SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO TO THE UNIVERSITY YOU TIE A ARE YOU P. LAB. AND A AND AND SINCE AND WE WE'VE WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO AND GET SOME ANSWERS AND AS AN ASSEMBLYMAN MCCARTY AS CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ASKED. ASKED DO YOU SEE THIRD PROVIDE HIM INFORMATION ON THE COST SAVINGS THAT THAT RESULTED FROM FROM MOVING THAT. THAT GOT SERVICES CONTRACT AND THAT YASSER THAT IN NOVEMBER NOVEMBER NINTH IN AND. THANKS TO TERRACE ONLY MEDINA IF SOMEONE MCCARTY ACTUALLY GOT AN ANSWER THAT I'M NOVEMBER NIGHT REQUEST ON FRIDAY. AND SO I'M AND THAT THAT RISK THAT THAT RESPONSE WAS LACKING DETAIL JUST HAD SOME NUMBERS WITH NO DOCUMENTATION TO BACK IT UP WHICH IS ACTUALLY WHAT. SIMON MCCARTY ASK FOR SO LONG WAVE BREED OF SAYING THAT. IT'S POSSIBLE THAT WE REALLY SUPPORT THE HECK OUT OF BEST VALUE CONTRACTING INDUSTRY IT YEAH IF IF WHAT WE WE BELIEVE THE BEST I COULD CONTRACTING MAKES A LOT OF SENSE. WE DON'T WE DON'T THINK AND IN THE CONTRACT THAT QUEST DIAGNOSTICS LOST TO THIS UTAH LAB WAS NOT A BEST VALUE CONTRACT APPARENTLY SIR IT WAS A SERVICES CONTRACT. IN THEORY BASED ON PRICE ALTHOUGH WE THERE'S NO THEY THEY HAVEN'T JUSTIFIED ANYTHING TO SHOW THAT THEY AND SAVE MONEY. I'M WHAT WHAT WE WOULDN'T WHAT WE WOULD REQUEST THIS IS BILL GOES FORWARD. IS IS TO THINK ABOUT AND SOME OF THE DEFINITIONS IN THE BILL IT SAYS BEST VALUE PRICING AS DETERMINED BY THE YOU SEE AN AND I THINK THAT YOU KNOW THIS COMMITTEES HEARD SOME SOME ISSUES ON CONTRACTING PRACTICES THAT YOU SEE IN THE EVENING AND YOU MIGHT WANT TO. PUT SOME TEETH ON THAT ARE PUT SOME PARAMETERS AROUND WHAT WHAT THE UC DETERMINES THE BEST PRICE TO BE AND IF THEY IF IT'S JUST UP TO YOU SEE A MEAN SORT OF ARBITRARY. AND AND WE THINK THAT I'M. YOU KNOW. EVEN THE EVEN THE CONTRACTED IT THAT WHAT THE LABS FOR SERVICES CONTRACT WITH A ARE YOU P. SHOULD SHOULD YOU KNOW FIT SOME OF THESE THINGS IF THE UC IS THE ECONOMIC ENGINE THAT DRIVES CALIFORNIA. AND WORKED THAT IT SKIPS CONTRACTING OUT FOR LABORATORY SERVICES FOR EXAMPLE. SHOULD BE DONE CALIFORNIA WE THINK THAT YOU KNOW E. YOU'RE GONNA IF YOU DID MEDICAL RESEARCH AND ALL THE THINGS THAT FLOW WITH THIS WORK TO YOU TARA. IS ALL GOING TO FLOW TO YOU TIME IN PEOPLE WHO ARE ARE ARE YOU KNOW GRADUATE STUDENTS IN THE UNIVERSE UTAH. WILL HAVE THE BENEFIT OF DRIVING THE UTAH ECONOMY RATHER THE CALIFORNIA ECONOMY SO I'M AS DUMB AS FORD I WANNA KEEP WORKING WITH MR MEDINA BECAUSE HE'S BEEN GREAT. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR INDULGENCE AND A HAVE A NICE DAY AS LONG TWO MINUTES THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT ANY ADDITIONAL COMMENTS FOR THE PUBLIC. DOWNTURN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. SHOULD YOU HAVE A APPOINTS AYE AYE I'VE SUPPORTED LEGISLATION ON BEST VALUE ANKLE INCLUDING FOR YOU SEE TO GIVE THAT FLEXIBILITY I'M I'M I'M NOT SUPPORTIVE OF REMOVING THE SUNSET FOR TWO REASONS. ONE. AND THIS IS OF MORE A FUNCTION OF HOW MUCH WE ARE RIGHT NOW. LOOKING FOR A NEW DAY AND YOU PROGRESS AND CONTINUE PROGRESS AND IN GOOD ADMINISTRATIVE DECISION MAKING AT THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA AND THAT WE AS A LEGISLATURE SHOULD BE A PARTNER IN THAT BEST VALUE IS PART OF IT BUT I THINK. IT IS APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A SUNSET JUST BY VIRTUE OF THE FACT THEY'RE SO MUCH CHANGE THAT NEEDS TO CONTINUE HAPPENED YOU SEE WITH THEIR. THEIR THEIR BEST ADMINISTRATIVE PRACTICES INCLUDING IN CONTRACTING. AND I SO I THINK IT'S APPROPRIATE TO HAVE A SUNSET AND SECONDLY BEST VALUE ISN'T ISN'T NOT. THE LOWEST BID SO I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE TAXPAYERS TO MAKE SURE THAT ON A REGULAR BASIS WE ARE CHECKING THE BEST VALUE WAS ALWAYS WORKING THE WAY IT SHOULD. AND. THAT MAY MEAN A FIVE YEAR SUNSET THAT'S A PRETTY SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF TIME PARTICULARLY FOR CONTRACTING IN BUDGET PLANNING AND OTHERWISE BUT I THINK FOR PURPOSES OF. BOTH THE PUBLIC TRUST AND ALWAYS REEVALUATING BEST BUY IS THE WAY TO GO. AS OPPOSED TO LOWEST BIDDING. THAT WE NEED TO HAVE THAT CHECK IN REGULARLY SO. RESPECTFULLY WILL NOT BE SPRING YOUR BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN BUT APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE BOTH AGREED ON BEST VALUE IN THE PAST. AND WITHOUT THIS IS. BEEN MOVED BY MISTER ARAMBULA SECONDED BY MISTER SANTIAGO THIS IS A DO PASSED TWO PROBES PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. I'M SORRY MISS YOU LIKE TO CLOSE EXCUSE ME MISTER CHAIRMAN KNOWLEDGE GO TO THE.
