THAT WILL BE SPENT IN THIS

00:14:23.729 --> 00:14:25.898
COMING FISCAL YEAR. GIVEN THE

ALLOCATED. SIGNIFICANT FUNDS AT

00:14:29.568 --> 00:14:30.436
LEAST CERTAINLY NOT AT THE

SCALE. ON WHICH THE LEGISLATURE

00:14:34.373 --> 00:14:35.341
ORIGINALLY PROPOSED. CERTAINLY

00:14:35.407 --> 00:14:37.276
SOME PAN- AND I'LL JUST I WILL

00:14:37.343 --> 00:14:39.111

PUBLIC HEALTH- THAT BEGAN IN

00:14:50.789 --> 00:14:53.392
THAT YEAR PLUS ONE SO THAT'S

00:14:53.459 --> 00:14:53.993
TWENTY TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE

00:14:54.059 --> 00:14:54.960
OF THREE HUNDRED MILLION

00:14:55.027 --> 00:14:58.397

REGARDS TO. THE AMOUNTS. OF THE%

00:15:03.569 --> 00:15:04.903
FEDERAL FUNDS I THINK THAT

00:15:04.970 --> 00:15:06.605
THERE WAS THE IDEA THAT THEY

00:15:06.672 --> 00:15:07.740
WOULD THERE IS THERE'S A

00:15:07.806 --> 00:15:08.874
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF FEDERAL

00:15:08.941 --> 00:15:11.944

00:15:14.647 --> 00:15:16.715
OFFICES IN THE BUDGET YEAR AND

00:15:16.782 --> 00:15:18.751
THAT THIS WOULD ALSO PROVIDE A

PLANNING YEAR FOR ANY

00:15:20.085 --> 00:15:21.086
ADMINISTRATION LEGISLATURE

AND THAT'S WHY YOU SEE THE ON

00:15:28.994 --> 00:15:30.696
GOING FUNDING IN THE OUT YEARS-

YOU KNOW WITH THE PANDEMIC THAT

00:31:53.611 --> 00:31:54.812

00:31:54.879 --> 00:31:57.215
THINGS A LOT OF THINGS THAT WE

00:31:57.282 --> 00:31:57.982

COLLEAGUES IT WASN'T JUST MY

00:32:17.302 --> 00:32:18.770

00:32:30.481 --> 00:32:31.983
IN THIS SPENDING BUT IN THE

EVEN THOUGH THERE'S GOING TO BE

00:32:36.154 --> 00:32:38.222
A REDUCTION NOW THAT THERE IS

00:32:38.289 --> 00:32:39.190

TAX REDUCTION CREDIT THAT COMES

STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY IS

00:34:45.917 --> 00:34:48.252
PRODUCED IN MY DISTRICT AND WE

00:34:50.121 --> 00:34:51.689
NORTH TO GO SOUTH I MEAN IF YOU

00:34:51.756 --> 00:34:52.990
LOOK AT THE COMMERCIALS THAT

00:34:53.057 --> 00:34:54.892
LOS ANGELES PUTS UP ABOUT BEING

COMES FROM MY DISTRICT IN THESE

00:35:00.465 --> 00:35:02.800
MAJOR LARGE SCALE SOLAR SOLAR

00:35:02.867 --> 00:35:05.503
PLANTS ARE NOT IN BURBANK AND

00:35:05.570 --> 00:35:06.771
THEY'RE NOT IN BERKELEY AND

00:35:06.838 --> 00:35:09.674

00:35:13.978 --> 00:35:14.979
SAY WE GET NOTHING FOR ITS

00:35:15.046 --> 00:35:17.448
BECAUSE WE TAKE- AGRICULTURAL

00:35:17.515 --> 00:35:20.384
LAND OUT OF PRODUCTION IN WHERE

00:35:20.451 --> 00:35:22.587
WE GET TAX REVENUE AND THEN

00:35:22.653 --> 00:35:24.121
THEY GET A TAX EXEMPTION FOR

00:35:24.188 --> 00:35:27.925
THE SOLAR TAX- SIX EXCLUSION IS

00:35:27.992 --> 00:35:29.627
THERE ANY PROGRESS BEING MADE

00:35:29.694 --> 00:35:31.229
ON THAT PARTICULAR SUBJECT

00:35:31.295 --> 00:35:32.597
MATTER I KNOW THE MAJORITY

00:35:32.663 --> 00:35:33.831
FLOOR LEADER HAS A BILL GOING

00:35:33.898 --> 00:35:35.199
THROUGH THE BUILDING TO BLOCK

00:35:35.266 --> 00:35:37.068
ANY BLACK BACK FEELS ESPECIALLY

00:35:37.134 --> 00:35:39.136
FOR. LARGE SCALE SOLAR WHICH

00:35:39.203 --> 00:35:41.739
JUST HURTS AGAIN A COMMUNITY

00:35:41.806 --> 00:35:42.607
THAT'S PROVIDING THE GOVERNOR

00:35:42.673 --> 00:35:44.509
IN THIS BODY TO MEET ITS

00:35:44.575 --> 00:35:46.010
RENEWABLE ENERGY GOALS SO JUST

00:35:46.077 --> 00:35:47.044
CURIOUS IF THERE HAD BEEN ANY

00:35:47.111 --> 00:35:50.147
FURTHER CONVERSATIONS ON THAT

00:35:50.214 --> 00:35:52.116
PARTICULAR SUBJECT MATTER. HI

00:35:52.183 --> 00:35:55.987
YES I THINK THE- THE TARGET-

00:35:56.053 --> 00:35:57.722
INVESTMENTS THAT ARE INCLUDED

00:35:57.788 --> 00:35:59.090
IN THIS BUDGET ARE REALLY TO

00:35:59.156 --> 00:36:03.127
HELP. DRIVE THE ECONOMY IN THE

00:36:03.194 --> 00:36:04.228
CENTRAL VALLEY IN THAT REGION

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:05.396
IN PARTICULAR IN OTHER REGIONS

00:36:05.463 --> 00:36:06.931
AROUND THE STATE THAT ARE

00:36:06.998 --> 00:36:09.433
TRANSITIONING FROM- WHAT TYPE

00:36:09.500 --> 00:36:12.570
OF WORK FORCE INTO ANOTHER. I

00:36:12.637 --> 00:36:15.640
KNOW WE HAVE TO TALK. OF WHICH

00:36:15.706 --> 00:36:16.941
THERE ARE SIX HUNDRED MILLION

00:36:17.008 --> 00:36:20.545
INCLUDED IN THIS PACKAGE AND- I

00:36:20.611 --> 00:36:22.346
THINK THAT THERE ARE DIFFERENT

00:36:22.413 --> 00:36:23.848
DISCUSSIONS IN REGARDS TO HOW

00:36:23.915 --> 00:36:26.083
THOSE DOLLARS- OUGHT TO BE USED

00:36:26.150 --> 00:36:28.185
BUT THAT THE GOAL IS TO REALLY-

00:36:28.252 --> 00:36:29.954
INVIGORATE ENCOURAGING SUPPORT

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:32.123
PLANNING. IN COMMUNITIES THAT

00:36:32.189 --> 00:36:34.225
ARE EXPERIENCING TRANSITIONS

00:36:34.292 --> 00:36:39.630
SUCH AS- AND THAT IS SIX

00:36:39.697 --> 00:36:40.231
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THAT'S

00:36:40.298 --> 00:36:41.432
INCLUDED IN THIS BUDGET. OKAY

00:36:41.499 --> 00:36:42.934
AND I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT THAT

00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:44.268
AS WELL YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND

00:36:44.335 --> 00:36:45.002
I WOULD SAY ON THE GROUND

00:36:45.069 --> 00:36:46.070
BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE'S

00:36:46.137 --> 00:36:47.638
GREAT INTENT IN THIS BUILDING

00:36:47.705 --> 00:36:49.707
TO TRY TO HELP COMMUNITIES. BUT

00:36:49.774 --> 00:36:50.775
WHAT DOESN'T WORK ON THE

00:36:50.841 --> 00:36:53.477
GROUND- SPECIFICALLY IN CURRENT

00:36:53.544 --> 00:36:54.745
AND THERE'S AN ORGANIZATION

00:36:54.812 --> 00:36:56.847
INVOLVED IN ACHIEVING THEM

00:36:56.914 --> 00:36:58.983
DOING I GUESS BEING AWARDED A

00:36:59.050 --> 00:37:00.785
LOT OF THAT MONEY. WHO PROBABLY

00:37:00.851 --> 00:37:02.320
WILL SPEND MILLIONS OF DOLLARS

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.354
AT THE BERKSHIRE HIGHER

00:37:03.421 --> 00:37:05.957
INSTITUTE IN NEW YORK AND SPEND

00:37:06.023 --> 00:37:06.657
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON

00:37:06.724 --> 00:37:08.259
CONSULTANTS ON TELLING KERRY

00:37:08.326 --> 00:37:10.161
COUNTY HAD A TRANSPOSITION AND

00:37:10.227 --> 00:37:12.029
PROVIDE MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY.

00:37:12.096 --> 00:37:14.231
WELL WE DO THAT NOW WITHOUT

00:37:14.298 --> 00:37:15.833
THOSE WITHOUT ALL THAT MONEY

00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:18.469
BEING SPENT ON CONSULTANTS-

00:37:18.536 --> 00:37:19.537
BECAUSE LIKE I SAID WE PROVIDE

00:37:19.604 --> 00:37:20.805
THE STATE THERE'S FIFTY EIGHT

00:37:20.871 --> 00:37:22.006
COUNTIES IN THE STATE THERE'S

00:37:22.073 --> 00:37:23.941
ONE COUNTY THAT GIVES YOU 53%

00:37:24.008 --> 00:37:25.009
OF THE STATE'S RENEWABLE ENERGY

00:37:25.076 --> 00:37:30.948
JUST ONE. AND THAT'S CURRENT-COUNTY. AND SO I AND- I

00:37:31.015 --> 00:37:32.350
UNDERSTAND THAT I JUST WISH

00:37:32.416 --> 00:37:33.184
THERE WAS SOME WAY THAT THE

00:37:33.250 --> 00:37:34.619
COUNTY COULD HAVE ACCESS TO

00:37:34.685 --> 00:37:35.786
THAT MONEY TO HIRE LAW

00:37:35.853 --> 00:37:37.722
ENFORCEMENT PAY FOR LIBRARIES.

00:37:37.788 --> 00:37:40.191
SCHOOLS THINGS THAT ARE NEEDED

00:37:40.257 --> 00:37:42.393

OFF THE DEFERRALS AS I SAID SO

00:41:29.620 --> 00:41:32.056
IT PAYS OFF THE DEBT WHEN WE

ALLOWS FOR A DEBT FREE COLLEGE

00:42:02.786 --> 00:42:07.524

DEPARTMENT OF CORRECTIONS AND

00:54:36.539 --> 00:54:37.474
REHABILITATION WE ARE DOING OUR

00:54:37.540 --> 00:54:39.809
BEST TO MINIMIZE- CONSTRUCTION

00:54:39.876 --> 00:54:41.211
PROJECTS AT ANY FACILITY THAT

00:54:41.277 --> 00:54:42.946

THERE TOWARDS THE TAIL END OF

00:54:49.986 --> 00:54:51.554
BEING FINISHED AND WHAT YOU SEE

00:54:51.621 --> 00:54:52.555
BEFORE YOU IS ACTUALLY A

00:54:52.622 --> 00:54:54.224
REDUCTION IN US ALREADY THROUGH

00:54:54.290 --> 00:54:55.725
LEASE REVENUE. SERVICE AS IT

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:57.093
WAS BEING SHIFTED TO GENERAL

00:54:57.160 --> 00:54:59.029
FUND. IN REGARDS TO THE COUNTY

00:54:59.095 --> 00:55:00.196
JAIL RELINQUISHMENT IT'S

00:55:00.263 --> 00:55:02.265
ACTUALLY A REDUCTION IN FUNDING

00:55:02.332 --> 00:55:04.634
THEY'LL GO TO COUNTY JAILS- AS

00:55:04.701 --> 00:55:05.502
THEY'VE BEEN RELINQUISHED OUR

00:55:05.568 --> 00:55:06.903
THEY WERE UNAWARE DEFINED SO IT

00:55:06.970 --> 00:55:09.939
WOULD NOT CONSTRUCT COUNTY

00:55:10.006 --> 00:55:11.007
JAILS AT THE LOCAL. LEVEL DOES

00:55:11.074 --> 00:55:11.541
THAT ANSWER YOUR QUESTION

00:55:11.608 --> 00:55:15.111
SENATOR. WELL I JUST NOTE THAT

00:55:15.178 --> 00:55:18.448
IN THE CASE OF CCC IN LASSEN

00:55:18.515 --> 00:55:19.015
COUNTY THEY DID A BUNCH OF

00:55:19.082 --> 00:55:22.686
IMPROVEMENTS ON THAT FACILITY.

00:55:22.752 --> 00:55:24.621
AND THEN. IT WAS SLATED TO SHUT

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.589
DOWN NOW I BELIEVE IN MY

00:55:26.656 --> 00:55:28.658
COMMUNITY BELIEVES THAT. THE

00:55:28.725 --> 00:55:31.361
ACTION THAT WAS TAKEN IT WAS

00:55:31.428 --> 00:55:32.729
OBVIOUSLY WASN'T FOR THE BEST

00:55:32.796 --> 00:55:33.730
INTEREST OF US BUT THERE WAS

00:55:33.797 --> 00:55:35.231
OTHER FACILITIES THAT WE'RE

00:55:35.298 --> 00:55:37.467
GOING TO MOVE THESE INMATES TO

00:55:37.534 --> 00:55:38.134
THE DIDN'T HAVE THE SAME

00:55:38.201 --> 00:55:39.469
UPGRADES AND MONEY SPENT ON

00:55:39.536 --> 00:55:42.906
THEM SO. BUT THERE'S A LOT OF

00:55:42.972 --> 00:55:45.241
MONEY BEING SPENT. AND AS THE

00:55:45.308 --> 00:55:46.242
POLICY THAT REALLY MATTERS IS

00:55:46.309 --> 00:55:48.978
HOW ARE WE- GOING TO DELEGATE

00:55:49.045 --> 00:55:51.448
OR USE THE RESOURCES AND A VERY

00:55:51.514 --> 00:55:53.249
COST EFFECTIVE WAY SO WHAT I'M

00:55:53.316 --> 00:55:55.385
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. IS ARE WE

00:55:55.452 --> 00:55:58.455
PLANNING WE KNOW THAT. THERE'S

00:55:58.521 --> 00:55:59.456
GOING TO BE MORE INMATES

00:55:59.522 --> 00:56:01.024
RELEASED OVER TIME.

00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:02.792
APPROXIMATELY SEVENTY SIX

00:56:02.859 --> 00:56:05.195
THOUSAND INMATES. WHAT WE WANT

00:56:05.261 --> 00:56:05.695
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THOSE

00:56:05.762 --> 00:56:09.399
FACILITIES. WORK AND MANAGE

00:56:09.466 --> 00:56:11.067
THESE INMATES SO THAT WE CAN

00:56:11.134 --> 00:56:13.002
ACTUALLY REHABILITATE SOME. AND

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:14.504
THAT'S THE GOAL SO FOR ME IT'S

00:56:14.571 --> 00:56:15.572
ABOUT THE POLICY OF HOW WE'RE

00:56:15.638 --> 00:56:16.806
GOING TO DO THE MONEY IN THE

00:56:16.873 --> 00:56:18.475
END IT HASN'T REALLY BEEN LAID

00:56:18.541 --> 00:56:20.310
OUT. AT LEAST IN MY MIND. WE'RE

00:56:20.376 --> 00:56:21.845
GOING TO GO FORWARD AND MAKE

00:56:21.911 --> 00:56:24.114
SURE THAT WE- DO THAT GIVE THE

00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:25.949
SERVICES THAT WE NEED TO GET.

00:56:26.015 --> 00:56:27.050
AND THEN ALSO MAKE SURE THAT

00:56:27.117 --> 00:56:28.818
WE'RE NOT WASTING MONEY BY

00:56:28.885 --> 00:56:31.020
FIXING SOME. FACILITY THAT

00:56:31.087 --> 00:56:31.621
WE'RE GONNA EVENTUALLY CLOSED

00:56:31.688 --> 00:56:44.701
DOWN. I THINK WILL ACCEPT THAT

00:56:44.768 --> 00:56:47.837
AS A APARTMENT- I THINK IT

00:56:47.904 --> 00:56:49.606

THINK WE MIGHT BE CLOSING SO

00:57:03.787 --> 00:57:06.523
THAT WE DON'T SPEND

00:57:06.589 --> 00:57:08.625
UNNECESSARILY AND THAT WAS A

00:57:08.691 --> 00:57:10.193
SUBJECT OF A LOT OF

00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:12.595

pCITY CLEAN UP IN THE AFTERNOON

AREA IT IS BANNED- SOMETHING

01:07:43.893 --> 01:07:46.262
THAT IS. THIS COULD BE

01:07:46.328 --> 01:07:48.364
SOMETHING VERY DIFFICULT FOR

01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:50.366
THE COMMUNITY TO HAVE HAD.

01:07:50.433 --> 01:07:52.368
THOSE THAT TOXIC AND HAZARDOUS

01:07:52.435 --> 01:07:54.603

THAT WE ARE ACTING ON THAT. AND

01:08:02.144 --> 01:08:05.514
THAT WE ARE ALSO- INSURING THAT

01:08:05.581 --> 01:08:09.452
IS JUST AS WE GO FORWARD THAT.

01:08:09.518 --> 01:08:11.287
HAZARDOUS SITES LIKE THAT

01:08:11.353 --> 01:08:13.122
HAZARDOUS AND TOXIC SITES THAT

01:08:13.189 --> 01:08:15.925
WE WOULD BE ABLE TO DO THE

01:08:15.991 --> 01:08:18.227
APPROPRIATE CLEANUP. BECAUSE IT

01:08:18.294 --> 01:08:20.162
IS NOT FAIR TO ANY COMMUNITY

01:08:20.229 --> 01:08:23.365
SETTING BE EXPOSED THAT WAY. SO

01:08:23.432 --> 01:08:25.768
SENATOR GROVE DID YOU. STILL GO

SENATOR Y. CASKEY. THANK YOU

01:08:29.605 --> 01:08:32.441
AGAIN THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR- SO

01:08:32.508 --> 01:08:34.410
I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

01:08:34.477 --> 01:08:35.478
THESE SITES ARE BEING CLEANED

01:08:35.544 --> 01:08:36.912
UP ESPECIALLY IN THE CITY OF

01:08:36.979 --> 01:08:39.782
VERNON IN THAT AREA- I DO HAVE

01:08:39.849 --> 01:08:46.155
A CONCERN ABOUT- AGAIN- I GUESS

01:08:46.222 --> 01:08:48.657
IN THE BACK AT SO. WE ALL COME

01:08:48.724 --> 01:08:49.792
FROM DIFFERENT PERSPECTIVES

01:08:49.859 --> 01:08:53.295
LIFE EXPERIENCES AND I BELIEVE

01:08:53.362 --> 01:08:55.431
THAT EVERY DOLLAR SPENT IN THIS

01:08:55.498 --> 01:08:57.466
CAPITAL ORIGINATES FROM

01:08:57.533 --> 01:09:00.369
BUSINESS. NOW I HAVE HAD

01:09:00.436 --> 01:09:02.371
ARGUMENTS OR CONVERSATIONS WITH

01:09:02.438 --> 01:09:04.573
SOME OF MY COLLEAGUES THAT- SAY

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:07.209
THEY PAY TAXES TOO AND I AGREE

01:09:07.276 --> 01:09:09.778
WE ALL PAY TAXES BUT ALL OF

01:09:09.845 --> 01:09:12.214
THAT ORIGINAL DOLLARS ORIGINATE

01:09:12.281 --> 01:09:15.484
FROM BUSINESS. AND BUSINESSES

01:09:15.551 --> 01:09:17.820
PAY PROPERTY TAXES AND THEY BUY

01:09:17.887 --> 01:09:19.355
BUSINESSES THEY PAY PROPERTY

01:09:19.421 --> 01:09:21.090
TAXESTHEY SIMPLY TAXES THEY

01:09:21.156 --> 01:09:22.658
HIRE PEOPLE WHO PAY TAXES ON

01:09:22.725 --> 01:09:25.294
THEIR WAGES. AND THEY PAY FEES

01:09:25.361 --> 01:09:28.097
AND FINES AND FEES THAT ARE

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:29.565
LIKE THIS PARTICULAR FEE THAT'S

01:09:29.632 --> 01:09:30.799
GOING TO INCREASE THREE HUNDRED

01:09:30.866 --> 01:09:32.768
AND TWENTY PERCENT- FOR

01:09:32.835 --> 01:09:34.904
BUSINESSES TO PICK UP THE TAB

01:09:34.970 --> 01:09:37.673
ON THAT. BUT EVERY DOLLAR THAT

01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:40.042
IS SPENT IN THIS BUILDING COMES

01:09:40.109 --> 01:09:42.578
FROM THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

01:09:42.645 --> 01:09:45.648
ORIGINALLY. NOW I REALIZE THAT.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:47.216
EMPLOYEES PAY TAXES BUT THEY

01:09:47.283 --> 01:09:48.651
GET THEIR ORIGINAL CHECK FROM

01:09:48.717 --> 01:09:51.754
THE BUSINESS OWNER- WE PAY

01:09:51.820 --> 01:09:53.989
TAXES BUT WE GET OUR ORIGINAL.

01:09:54.056 --> 01:09:54.523
MANY THAT COMES FROM THE

01:09:54.590 --> 01:09:56.058
GENERAL FUND THAT PAYS US AS

01:09:56.125 --> 01:09:59.428
LEGISLATORS- COMES FROM THE

01:09:59.495 --> 01:10:01.463
BUSINESS COMMUNITY SO I HAVE A

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.666
HUGE CONCERN THAT THIS INCREASE

01:10:03.732 --> 01:10:05.301
TARGETS THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:08.404
WHETHER LARGE OR SMALL- BY

01:10:08.470 --> 01:10:08.938
THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

01:10:09.004 --> 01:10:12.841
PERCENT. IS THERE A REASON WHY

01:10:12.908 --> 01:10:13.842
WE'RE TARGETING THE BUSINESS

01:10:13.909 --> 01:10:16.545
COMMUNITY FOR THE THIS

01:10:16.612 --> 01:10:18.747
PARTICULAR INCREASING D. TSC.

01:10:18.814 --> 01:10:20.249
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION- I

01:10:20.316 --> 01:10:21.417
JUST WANT TO POINT OUT THAT

01:10:21.483 --> 01:10:23.752
THE- THE BILL ELIMINATES THE

01:10:23.819 --> 01:10:25.087
ENVIRONMENTAL FEE FOR

01:10:25.154 --> 01:10:27.089
APPROXIMATELY FOURTEEN THOUSAND

01:10:27.156 --> 01:10:28.524
BUSINESSES WITH FEWER THAN ONE

01:10:28.591 --> 01:10:30.526
HUNDRED EMPLOYEES. SO SMALLER

01:10:30.593 --> 01:10:32.595
BUSINESSES WILL ACTUALLY SEE A

01:10:32.661 --> 01:10:33.162
REDUCTION IN THEIR

01:10:33.228 --> 01:10:35.064
ENVIRONMENTAL FEE- AND IT DOES

01:10:35.130 --> 01:10:36.432
RESTRUCTURE THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:10:36.498 --> 01:10:38.968
CONTROL ACCOUNT VS- IT TO

01:10:39.034 --> 01:10:41.637
CHARGE ON A PART TIME BASIS TO

01:10:41.704 --> 01:10:43.339
REALLY REFLECT. THE POLLUTER

01:10:43.405 --> 01:10:45.908
PAYS- STRUCTURE- WHICH WE THINK

01:10:45.975 --> 01:10:47.977
IS FAIR AND APPROPRIATE AND SO

01:10:48.043 --> 01:10:51.780
JUST TO HIGHLIGHT- WELL THERE

01:10:51.847 --> 01:10:53.215
IS AN INCREASE THAT WILL

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.818
GENERATE ADDITIONAL REVENUES-

01:10:55.884 --> 01:10:57.720
THE IDEA IS TO MAKE THIS A

01:10:57.786 --> 01:11:01.190
FAIRER. WAY DEALING WITH THOSE

01:11:01.256 --> 01:11:03.359
FEES. THANK YOU DIRECTOR LEE-

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:06.395
YOU MADE A COMMENT POLLUTER PAY

01:11:06.462 --> 01:11:09.932
STRUCTURE WHAT IS THAT- I

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:11.433
DEFERRED THAT QUESTION FOR A

01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.801
MORE DETAILED RESPONSE TO MY

01:11:12.868 --> 01:11:14.069
COLLEAGUE BUT ESSENTIALLY IT

01:11:14.136 --> 01:11:17.640
IS- THE MORE. THE MORE YOU PAY-

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:21.276
AND- I'M NOT SURE WHO'S ON THE

01:11:21.343 --> 01:11:21.877
LINE BUT I WILL DEFER THAT TO

01:11:21.944 --> 01:11:24.246
MY COLLEAGUE. HEY ANDREW MARCH

01:11:24.313 --> 01:11:25.280
WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE

01:11:25.347 --> 01:11:26.882
SO GENERALLY THE POLLUTER PAYS

01:11:26.949 --> 01:11:30.486
PRINCIPLE- REFLECTS EXACTLY AS-

01:11:30.552 --> 01:11:32.287
DIRECTLY STATED THAT THE MORE

01:11:32.354 --> 01:11:34.089
THAT YOU POLLUTE THE YOU KNOW

01:11:34.156 --> 01:11:35.991
THERE'S A THERE'S A FAIR COST-

01:11:36.058 --> 01:11:38.160
ALLOCATIONS FOR THOSE- FOR THAT

01:11:38.227 --> 01:11:39.928
POLLUTION. AS UNDER THE CURRENT

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.697
HAZARDOUS WASTE- CONTROL

01:11:41.764 --> 01:11:45.334
ACCOUNT STRUCTURE- ANY ANY

01:11:45.401 --> 01:11:46.969
HAZARDOUS WASTE GENERATED ABOUT

01:11:47.036 --> 01:11:48.570
I BELIEVE TWENTY FIVE HUNDRED

01:11:48.637 --> 01:11:50.806
TIMES ADDED THAT BUSINESSES NOT

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:52.708
PAY ANY ADDITIONAL REGULATORY

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:55.344
FEES- SO. AT THE END OF THE

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:58.647
DAY- THE SMALLER GENERATORS I

01:11:58.714 --> 01:11:59.748
CAN SUBSTITUTE OR ARE

01:11:59.815 --> 01:12:01.750
SUBSIDIZING LARGER GENERATORS

01:12:01.817 --> 01:12:04.286
SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL- BEING A

01:12:04.353 --> 01:12:06.655
PER TON BASIS REGARDLESS OF HOW

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:09.892
MUCH. YOU MAKE OTHERS NO CAP-

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.160
THAT YOU YOU'D BE PAYING THE

01:12:11.226 --> 01:12:14.196
SAME AMOUNT ON A PART TIME

01:12:14.263 --> 01:12:15.397
BASIS. AND THANK YOU SO MAYBE

01:12:15.464 --> 01:12:16.865
I'M MISUNDERSTANDING I THOUGHT

01:12:16.932 --> 01:12:19.034
THIS WAS THE ENVIRONMENTAL. FEE

01:12:19.101 --> 01:12:20.569
THAT YOU PAID EVERY YEAR BASED

01:12:20.636 --> 01:12:22.037
ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT

01:12:22.104 --> 01:12:24.740
YOU HAVE. SO AND THERE'S A

01:12:24.807 --> 01:12:27.710
SCALE AT THE END OF THE YEAR A

01:12:27.776 --> 01:12:30.179
BUSINESS GETS A- REPORT IF YOU

01:12:30.245 --> 01:12:35.751
HAVE. ZERO TEN FIFTEEN FIFTY

01:12:35.818 --> 01:12:36.351
ONE TO NINETY NINE NINETY NINE

01:12:36.418 --> 01:12:36.952
TO FOUR NINETY NINE AND THEN

01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.554
ABOVE FIVE HUNDRED. SO THE WAY

01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:40.489
THAT THIS TAX IS CALCULATED

01:12:40.556 --> 01:12:42.391
FROM MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

01:12:42.458 --> 01:12:44.793
AND- THE MORE EMPLOYEES THAT

01:12:44.860 --> 01:12:45.928
YOU GIVE A JOB TO AN

01:12:45.994 --> 01:12:47.296
OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE FOR

01:12:47.362 --> 01:12:48.530
THEIR FAMILIES THE HIGHER YOUR

01:12:48.597 --> 01:12:52.601
PENALTY OR TAXES. IS THAT NOT

01:12:52.668 --> 01:12:53.802
THE TAX WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

01:12:53.869 --> 01:12:54.737
THAT'S GREAT SO THAT'S ONE OF

01:12:54.803 --> 01:12:56.672
THE TAXES ARE ONE OF THE FEES

01:12:56.739 --> 01:12:58.173
ACTIONS- CONTAINED IN THIS

01:12:58.240 --> 01:12:59.742
TRAILER BILLS THE ENVIRONMENTAL

01:12:59.808 --> 01:13:01.276
C. N. AS YOU STATED IT'S BASED

01:13:01.343 --> 01:13:03.145
ON THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES. SO

01:13:03.212 --> 01:13:05.481
CURRENTLY THAT FEE IS- ON ALL

01:13:05.547 --> 01:13:06.715
BUSINESSES WITH FIFTY OR MORE

01:13:06.782 --> 01:13:08.150
EMPLOYEES OR A CERTAIN NUMBER

01:13:08.217 --> 01:13:09.785
OF BUSINESSES AND CERTAIN

01:13:09.852 --> 01:13:10.753
INDUSTRIES WITH FIFTY OR MORE

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.721
EMPLOYEES- THIS PROPOSAL

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:15.424
ELIMINATES THAT FEE FOR A BIT-

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:18.627
BUSINESSES WITH- MORE FIFTY TO

01:13:18.694 --> 01:13:20.162
NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES- WHICH IS

01:13:20.229 --> 01:13:21.597
AROUND FOURTEEN THOUSAND

01:13:21.663 --> 01:13:22.197
BUSINESSES THAT WILL NO LONGER

01:13:22.264 --> 01:13:24.166
BE PAYING THAT FEE- IT

01:13:24.233 --> 01:13:25.534
MAINTAINS THE FEE FOR

01:13:25.601 --> 01:13:27.770
BUSINESSES BETWEEN. FIVE

01:13:27.836 --> 01:13:29.071
HUNDRED AND NINE HUNDRED NINETY

01:13:29.138 --> 01:13:29.872
NINE EMPLOYEES AND THEN RAISES

01:13:29.938 --> 01:13:33.542
THE C. ON BUSINESSES ABOUT ONE

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:34.943
THOUSAND EMPLOYEES. M. IS IT

01:13:35.010 --> 01:13:36.345
ONLY RAISED ON THE BUSINESSES

01:13:36.411 --> 01:13:37.980
OF ONE THOUSAND EMPLOYEES HAS

01:13:38.046 --> 01:13:39.848
UP TO THREE HUNDRED AND 20%

01:13:39.915 --> 01:13:43.318
INCREASE OR- THAT'S CORRECT. SO

01:13:43.385 --> 01:13:46.088
AGAIN I GUESS AND AGAIN I GUESS

01:13:46.155 --> 01:13:47.623
IT'S JUST LIFE EXPERIENCES I

01:13:47.689 --> 01:13:49.658
BELIEVE THAT- YOU KNOW THOSE

01:13:49.725 --> 01:13:50.959
EMPLOYERS THAT PROVIDE THOSE

01:13:51.026 --> 01:13:52.928
PEOPLE JOBS AND AN OPPORTUNITY

01:13:52.995 --> 01:13:55.998
TO PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES-

01:13:56.064 --> 01:13:57.800
WHY WE TARGET THEM I DON'T

01:13:57.866 --> 01:13:59.868
KNOW- I DO KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:02.237
THERE'S A- IT'S POLITICALLY

01:14:02.304 --> 01:14:03.972
CORRECT I GUESS TO SAY LARGE

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.908
BUSINESS VERSUS SMALL BUSINESS.

01:14:05.974 --> 01:14:07.309
BUT THERE ARE A LOT OF LARGE

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:09.645
BUSINESSES LEAVING CALIFORNIA

01:14:09.711 --> 01:14:12.080
AND- AT THREE HUNDRED AND 20%

01:14:12.147 --> 01:14:13.949
INCREASE JUST BASED ON THE

01:14:14.016 --> 01:14:15.250
NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES THAT YOU

01:14:15.317 --> 01:14:17.152
HIRE IF YOU'RE GIVING. YOU

01:14:17.219 --> 01:14:19.822
KNOW. IF YOU HAVE NINETY NINE

01:14:19.888 --> 01:14:21.824
EMPLOYEES AND YOU CAN'T GIVE

01:14:21.890 --> 01:14:22.891
ONE MORE PERSON TO JOB- YOU'D

01:14:22.958 --> 01:14:24.860
BE SUBJECT TO THAT INCREASE OF

01:14:24.927 --> 01:14:25.894
THREE INTERN 20% ON THAT

01:14:25.961 --> 01:14:27.930
ENVIRONMENTAL TAXI. JUST

01:14:27.996 --> 01:14:29.231
BECAUSE YOU GAVE SOMEBODY AN

01:14:29.298 --> 01:14:32.201
OPPORTUNITY HAVE A JOB. EVEN

01:14:32.267 --> 01:14:34.469
THOUGH THEY'RE NOT IN THE-

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:36.705
DISPOSAL TRANSFER PROCESS SCENE

01:14:36.772 --> 01:14:38.874
OF ANY TOXIC SUBSTANCES IT'S

01:14:38.941 --> 01:14:40.943
JUST THE FACT THAT. THEY DRIVE

01:14:41.009 --> 01:14:44.947
TO WORK OR- THE AND- IT'S JUST

01:14:45.013 --> 01:14:47.049
BECAUSE YOU HIRED SOMEBODY- I

01:14:47.115 --> 01:14:48.584
JUST THINK THAT I APPRECIATE

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:49.852
THE FACT THAT YOU GUYS DID LOOK

01:14:49.918 --> 01:14:51.553
AT THAT WE'LL START THERE. I DO

01:14:51.620 --> 01:14:52.454
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU

01:14:52.521 --> 01:14:53.655
GUYS DID LOOK AT THE SMALLER

01:14:53.722 --> 01:14:55.624
BUSINESSES. THAT HAVE FEWER

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:56.792
THAN NINETY NINE EMPLOYEES AND

01:14:56.859 --> 01:14:58.760
IT DOES SAY FOURTEEN THOUSAND-

01:14:58.827 --> 01:15:01.163
BUSINESSES THIS TAX AND THAT

01:15:01.230 --> 01:15:03.398
SEASON ROUGHLY BETWEEN

01:15:03.465 --> 01:15:05.400
400-021-2000 DOLLARS A YEAR.

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:08.170
BUT AND I GUESS MY CONCERN ON

01:15:08.237 --> 01:15:10.138
THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE IS THAT

01:15:10.205 --> 01:15:11.039
YOU'RE EXPANDING THE FEE ON

01:15:11.106 --> 01:15:13.275
BUSINESS. JUST SOLELY ON THE

01:15:13.342 --> 01:15:14.710
FACT THAT THEY PROVIDE

01:15:14.776 --> 01:15:17.346
EMPLOYEES A JOB. I THINK THAT

01:15:17.412 --> 01:15:19.081
THE ENTIRE STRUCTURE OF THE WAY

01:15:19.147 --> 01:15:21.583
GOVERNMENT OPERATES. ISN'T VERY

01:15:21.650 --> 01:15:23.218
DIFFICULT A VERY DETRIMENTAL TO

01:15:23.285 --> 01:15:25.687
BUSINESS THE HIGHER THE WAGES

01:15:25.754 --> 01:15:27.623
THE HIGHER THE WORKERS COMP.

01:15:27.689 --> 01:15:29.157
AND THE HIGHER THE WAGES THE

01:15:29.224 --> 01:15:31.193
HIGHER THE LIABILITY INSURANCE

01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:32.094
BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS TIED TO

01:15:32.160 --> 01:15:35.063
WAGES- EXCEPT FOR MEDICAL

01:15:35.130 --> 01:15:36.531
INSURANCE IS NOT TIED TO WAGES

01:15:36.598 --> 01:15:37.799
IT'S TIED TO THE NUMBER OF

01:15:37.866 --> 01:15:40.168
EMPLOYEES. THAT AND I THINK

01:15:40.235 --> 01:15:41.670
THERE HAS TO BE A BETTER SFI

01:15:41.737 --> 01:15:42.905
STRUCTURE I THINK THIS IS A

01:15:42.971 --> 01:15:44.306
STEP FORWARD AT LEAST

01:15:44.373 --> 01:15:45.340
ELIMINATING THE FOURTEEN

01:15:45.407 --> 01:15:47.175
THOUSAND. BUSINESSES THAT WOULD

01:15:47.242 --> 01:15:49.111
HAVE TO NOT ELIMINATE THE TAX

01:15:49.177 --> 01:15:51.914
NOT THE BUSINESS THE TAXES TO.

01:15:51.980 --> 01:15:52.881
FOURTEEN THOUSAND BUSINESSES

01:15:52.948 --> 01:15:53.782
BUT I THINK WE NEED TO LOOK AT

01:15:53.849 --> 01:15:57.853
A STRUCTURE MOVING FORWARD-

01:15:57.920 --> 01:15:59.488
JUST ON. I JUST I GUESS MY

01:15:59.554 --> 01:16:01.990
POINT IS. RAMBLING ON AND I DO

01:16:02.057 --> 01:16:03.659
APOLOGIZE FOR THAT WHY DO WE

01:16:03.725 --> 01:16:05.794
PUNISH EMPLOYERS FOR HIRING

01:16:05.861 --> 01:16:07.829
PEOPLE. THAT'S AWESOME I GUESS

01:16:07.896 --> 01:16:09.464
MY CONCERN BUT THANK YOU VERY

01:16:09.531 --> 01:16:10.999
MUCH FOR ADDRESSING THAT IT IS

01:16:11.066 --> 01:16:12.567
IT TRUE THAT THIS TAX WILL GO

01:16:12.634 --> 01:16:16.905
UP- THREE HUNDRED AND 20% OKAY

01:16:16.972 --> 01:16:20.275
SO. SORRY YOU HAD ALREADY

01:16:20.342 --> 01:16:22.811
ADDRESSED THAT YOU WOULD ASK

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:23.312
THE QUESTION WAS ALREADY

01:16:23.378 --> 01:16:27.149
ADDRESSED. THE THREE INTERN 20%

01:16:27.215 --> 01:16:28.517
I HEARD BUT TO GO HEAD

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:31.286
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. OR YES

01:16:31.353 --> 01:16:33.188
AND SO OVERALL THE REVENUES FOR

01:16:33.255 --> 01:16:34.656
THE ACCOUNTS ARE NOT ARE ONLY

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:36.591
GOING UP BY AROUND- THEY'RE

01:16:36.658 --> 01:16:39.294
DOUBLING SO A 100% AND SO I

01:16:39.361 --> 01:16:40.896
THINK SPECIFICALLY IF YOU LOOK

01:16:40.963 --> 01:16:43.465
ON A SECTOR BY SECTOR EMPLOYEE.

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.466
EMPLOYED HERE I THINK THAT'S

01:16:44.533 --> 01:16:46.368
WHERE THAT 310020% NUMBERS

01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:48.537
COMING FROM- I WOULD JUST POINT

01:16:48.603 --> 01:16:50.939
OUT TWO THINGS ONE IS THAT- IT

01:16:51.006 --> 01:16:52.908
INCLUDING THIS BUDGET YEAR- THE

01:16:52.975 --> 01:16:54.209
GENERAL FUND HAS PROVIDED

01:16:54.276 --> 01:16:56.878
AROUND- ONE HUNDRED MILLION

01:16:56.945 --> 01:16:58.647
DOLLARS TO BACK FILL THESE TWO

01:16:58.714 --> 01:16:59.982
FUNDS THE HAZARDOUS WASTE

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:01.116
CONTROL ACCOUNT AND THE TOXIC

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:03.285
SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACCOUNT. AND

01:17:03.352 --> 01:17:04.753
ADDITIONALLY ONE OF THEIR

01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:05.754
APARTMENTS FOR THE BOARD OF

01:17:05.821 --> 01:17:07.289
ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY IN THIS

01:17:07.356 --> 01:17:08.924
BILL IS TO LOOK AT THIS THE

01:17:08.991 --> 01:17:10.892
STRUCTURE IN THE FUTURE TO SEE

01:17:10.959 --> 01:17:12.194
IF THE RESTRUCTURING OF BUT

01:17:12.260 --> 01:17:13.762
THESE WOULD E APPROPRIATE.

GENERATING AT. A MINUTE THAT'S

01:19:23.859 --> 01:19:26.394

YEARS AND WHAT THIS DOES IS

01:19:42.010 --> 01:19:45.881
TRUE TRUE UPS. THE COSTED IT

01:19:45.947 --> 01:19:48.083
HAS IN CALIFORNIA TO PRODUCE

01:19:48.150 --> 01:19:49.651
HAZARDOUS MATERIALS WHICH WE

01:19:49.718 --> 01:19:51.153
NEED WE NEED THE PRODUCTS THAT

01:19:51.219 --> 01:19:52.053
THEY MAKE BUT THERE'S A BY

HAVE BEEN ABLE TO DEVELOP JUST

01:23:10.352 --> 01:23:11.619
BECAUSE THERE WASN'T MONEY TO

01:23:11.686 --> 01:23:14.189

01:23:14.255 --> 01:23:16.624

01:23:24.099 --> 01:23:25.767
LEGISLATURE TOGETHER IN TWO

01:23:25.834 --> 01:23:28.803
THOUSAND AND TWELVE- SO THIS IS

01:23:28.870 --> 01:23:31.072
I MEAN. AND THEN I. LOOK FOR MY

01:23:31.139 --> 01:23:32.173

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.389
CONSEQUENCES OF SOME OF THE

01:23:47.455 --> 01:23:48.390
THINGS THAT WE PRODUCE AND

AGAIN DO WE NEED THEM YES BUT

01:23:50.125 --> 01:23:51.693
DO WE ALSO HAVE TO MAKE SURE

01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.094
THAT THE PEOPLE WHO LIVE IN

01:23:53.161 --> 01:23:54.295

MEMBERS I WANT TO RISE ON THIS

01:24:09.811 --> 01:24:12.147
ISSUE BECAUSE I WORK AT THE

01:24:12.213 --> 01:24:15.350
GOOD ASSEMBLY. CRISTINA GARCIA

01:24:15.417 --> 01:24:18.453
ON DECK SIDE ISSUE AND- I

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:21.823
SERVED ON EQ- TOXICS IN THE IN

01:24:21.890 --> 01:24:23.958
BOTH HOUSES AND- MAKE NO

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:25.593
MISTAKE ABOUT IT. WHAT HAPPENED

01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.062
WITH THAT SIDE WAS OVER A LONG

01:24:28.129 --> 01:24:30.098
PERIOD OF TIME THE LOCALS DID

01:24:30.165 --> 01:24:31.666
NOT DO THE RIGHT THING. LET'S

01:24:31.733 --> 01:24:32.567
FACE IT THE AIR POLLUTION

01:24:32.634 --> 01:24:34.669
CONTROL. DISTRICT DID NOT DO

01:24:34.736 --> 01:24:36.538
THEIR DUE DILIGENCE. AND THE

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.506
TAXPAYERS HAVE PAID WE DID WE

01:24:38.573 --> 01:24:39.674
DID FOLLOW THE MONE IN THE

01:24:39.741 --> 01:24:41.209
BUDGET. BUT THERE WAS A TWO

01:24:41.276 --> 01:24:43.077
DOLLAR FEE FOR EVERY BATTERY

01:24:43.144 --> 01:24:45.246
THAT SOLD IN CALIFORNIA THE

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:47.015
GOAL IS TO HELP PAID UP FRONT.

01:24:47.081 --> 01:24:48.950
AND WHAT WE NEED TO FOCUS ON

01:24:49.017 --> 01:24:50.618
HERE IS THE FACT THAT WHAT IS

01:24:50.685 --> 01:24:53.922
THE FUTURE BRING. WHAT WE KNOW

01:24:53.988 --> 01:24:56.057
HAPPENED IN THE PAST WAS WRONG.

01:24:56.124 --> 01:24:57.559
WE SAW COMMUNITIES WHERE

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.294
THEY'RE MAINLY DISADVANTAGED.

01:24:59.360 --> 01:25:00.895
LOW INCOME PEOPLE AND THAT'S

01:25:00.962 --> 01:25:02.931
WHERE THE MANUFACTURING WAS IN

01:25:02.997 --> 01:25:04.799
VERNON THOSE TYPE OF PLACES.

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.601
WRONG WE DIDN'T DO A GOOD JOB

01:25:06.668 --> 01:25:08.703
OF MAKING SURE THAT THE COMPANY

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:11.005
WHO NOW HAS GONE AND LEFT AND

01:25:11.072 --> 01:25:13.475
WHO'S PICKING UP THE BILL.

01:25:13.541 --> 01:25:14.843
EVERY SINGLE PERSON THAT BUYS A

01:25:14.909 --> 01:25:16.644
BATTERY IN THE STATE OF

01:25:16.711 --> 01:25:19.380
CALIFORNIA IS PAYING THE BILL.

01:25:19.447 --> 01:25:21.115
NOW WE WANT TO STOP THAT FROM

01:25:21.182 --> 01:25:23.384
HAPPENING IN THE FUTURE. THAT'S

01:25:23.451 --> 01:25:25.553
THE GOAL HERE IS TO NOT TO DO

01:25:25.620 --> 01:25:27.589
THE RIGHT THING CALIFORNIA.

01:25:27.655 --> 01:25:30.425
LEADS THE WORLD WHEN IT COMES

01:25:30.492 --> 01:25:33.328
TO ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY. WE DO

01:25:33.394 --> 01:25:34.829
WE DO A GOOD JOB HERE BUT WE

01:25:34.896 --> 01:25:36.698
ALSO HAVE TO STRIKE A BALANCE

01:25:36.764 --> 01:25:38.766
THE BALANCE HAS TO BE CAN WE

01:25:38.833 --> 01:25:39.567
KEEP THOSE JOBS HERE IN

01:25:39.634 --> 01:25:41.536
CALIFORNIA PRODUCE THE PRODUCTS

01:25:41.603 --> 01:25:44.572
THAT WE NEED. AT THE SAME TIME

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:47.775
NOT PUSHING THOSE COMPANIES AND-

01:25:47.842 --> 01:25:50.011
TOXICS AND THINGS OUT OF OUR

01:25:50.078 --> 01:25:50.712
STATE WORSE NOT DONE IN THE

01:25:50.778 --> 01:25:53.248
SAME MANNER. SO THE GOAL HERE

01:25:53.314 --> 01:25:55.950
IS TO STRIKE A BALANCE. OUR

01:25:56.017 --> 01:25:58.887
COST OF MATERIALS WILL GO UP.

01:25:58.953 --> 01:25:59.921
BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO

01:25:59.988 --> 01:26:01.823
PAY. AND THESE COMPANIES ARE

01:26:01.890 --> 01:26:03.858
GOING TO WHEN THEY DO GET THE

01:26:03.925 --> 01:26:04.425
THOUSAND THE COMPANIES THAT

01:26:04.492 --> 01:26:05.460
HAVE A THOUSAND EMPLOYEES OR

01:26:05.527 --> 01:26:07.362
MORE ARE GOING TO PAY MORE AND

01:26:07.428 --> 01:26:08.596
THAT MEANS THE PRODUCTS THEY

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:10.498
PRODUCE. ARE GONNA GO UP. IT'S

01:26:10.565 --> 01:26:11.766
VERY DIFFICULT TO AFFORD TO

01:26:11.833 --> 01:26:13.234
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THOSE

01:26:13.301 --> 01:26:14.802
ARE THE BALANCES THAT THIS.

01:26:14.869 --> 01:26:16.504
BUDGET COMMITTEE NEEDS TO

01:26:16.571 --> 01:26:17.906
STRIKE IT'S GOOD WE HAVE THESE

01:26:17.972 --> 01:26:19.774
CONVERSATIONS WE CANNOT CHANGE

01:26:19.841 --> 01:26:21.809
THE PAST. BUT WE CAN SURELY

01:26:21.876 --> 01:26:23.711
CHANGE THE FUTURE. AND THAT'S

01:26:23.778 --> 01:26:25.380
THE GOAL OF THIS BUDGET

01:26:25.446 --> 01:26:26.614
COMMITTEE IS TO TRY TO MAKE.

01:26:26.681 --> 01:26:28.182
GOOD POLICY DECISIONS AND

01:26:28.249 --> 01:26:30.818
STRIKE THAT BALANCE. AND THE

01:26:30.885 --> 01:26:31.920
ONE THING THAT FRUSTRATES ME IN

01:26:31.986 --> 01:26:34.956
CALIFORNIA IS THAT. WE GO TOO

01:26:35.023 --> 01:26:37.892
FAR SOMETIMES IN PUSHING TO TRY

01:26:37.959 --> 01:26:39.594
TO MAKE EVERYTHING PERFECT AS

01:26:39.661 --> 01:26:41.663
WE PUSH WE PUSH THOSE COMPANIES

01:26:41.729 --> 01:26:43.598
OUT OF CALIFORNIA WHICH DRIVES

01:26:43.665 --> 01:26:44.499
DOWN THE AMOUNT OF PEOPLE

01:26:44.566 --> 01:26:47.435
WORKING SO FOR ME THIS ISSUE IS

01:26:47.502 --> 01:26:49.771
A REALLY TOUGH ONE. BECAUSE I

01:26:49.837 --> 01:26:51.072
SUPPORT THE FACT THAT WE NEED

01:26:51.139 --> 01:26:52.840
TO DO THE RIGHT THING AND MAKES

01:26:52.907 --> 01:26:55.076
OUR COMMUNITIES ARE SAFE BUT

01:26:55.143 --> 01:26:56.110
THE SAME TIME I DON'T WANT TO

01:26:56.177 --> 01:26:58.179
PENALIZE THE COMPANIES THAT ARE

01:26:58.246 --> 01:26:59.280
HERE IN CALIFORNIA PUSH THEM

01:26:59.347 --> 01:27:01.316
OUT. SO I HAVEN'T DECIDED ON

01:27:01.382 --> 01:27:02.784
THIS BILL YET THIS IS ONE NIGHT

01:27:02.850 --> 01:27:04.719
WE HAVE A NON ON ON OUR CAUCUS

01:27:04.786 --> 01:27:06.321
AND I'M DEPEND ON INSIDE I'M

01:27:06.387 --> 01:27:08.189
DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT. TO

01:27:08.256 --> 01:27:11.526
VOTE FOR OR OR TO LAY OFF OR TO

01:27:11.593 --> 01:27:13.494
VOTE AGAINST IT. BECAUSE WE

01:27:13.561 --> 01:27:15.063
NEEDTO STRIKE A BALANCE THE

01:27:15.129 --> 01:27:17.098
POLICY HOW IT GETS IMPLEMENTED.

01:27:17.165 --> 01:27:19.534
ARE KEY. TO DOING THE RIGHT

01:27:19.601 --> 01:27:20.201
THING IN CALIFORNIA I JUST WANT

01:27:20.268 --> 01:27:22.637
TO RISE AND SAY THAT. I WORKED

01:27:22.704 --> 01:27:24.138
VERY CLOSELY ON THIS ISSUE IT'S

01:27:24.205 --> 01:27:25.974
NOT JUST EXCITED THOUGH. THAT'S

01:27:26.040 --> 01:27:27.542
THE ONE THING THAT GLITTERS OUT

01:27:27.609 --> 01:27:29.477
TO US IS EXCITED BUT IT'S- IT'S

01:27:29.544 --> 01:27:31.346
AGRICULTURE IT'S- IT'S

01:27:31.412 --> 01:27:34.282
PETROLEUM IT'S ALL THE THINGS

01:27:34.349 --> 01:27:37.552
WE USE EVERY DAY. IN CALIFORNIA

01:27:37.619 --> 01:27:38.586
WE NEED TO STRIKE A BALANCE

01:27:38.653 --> 01:27:40.221
WILL COME FROM FOR WHAT I'M

01:27:40.288 --> 01:27:41.489
REALLY TRYING TO SAY IS THAT I

01:27:41.556 --> 01:27:42.857
WANT PEOPLE TO STILL STAY IN

01:27:42.924 --> 01:27:44.158
CALIFORNIA DO THEIR BUSINESS

01:27:44.225 --> 01:27:46.094
HERE. AT THE SAME TIME I WANT

01:27:46.160 --> 01:27:47.962
TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT. SO

01:27:48.029 --> 01:27:50.398
I JUST URGE MEMBERS THAT. WHEN

01:27:50.465 --> 01:27:51.766
I KNOW THIS IS GOING TO PASS.

01:27:51.833 --> 01:27:53.768
BUT I URGE YOU TO FOLLOW THE

01:27:53.835 --> 01:27:55.403
POLICY WHEN IT GETS ACTUALLY

01:27:55.470 --> 01:27:57.138
IMPLEMENTED AND MAKE SURE THAT.

01:27:57.205 --> 01:27:58.439
WE'RE DOING THE RIGHT THING IF

01:27:58.506 --> 01:27:59.374
WE NEED TO COME BACK AND TWEAK

01:27:59.440 --> 01:28:01.442
IT WITH LEGISLATION. TO GET

01:28:01.509 --> 01:28:02.443
WHERE WE WANT TO GO WE NEED TO

01:28:02.510 --> 01:28:04.312
DO THAT. BECAUSE THE DEVIL IS

01:28:04.379 --> 01:28:05.847

A BARBER DOING MANY THINGS BUT

01:29:15.249 --> 01:29:16.417
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

01:29:16.484 --> 01:29:17.618
TO REMEMBER IF WE LOOK TO THE

01:29:17.685 --> 01:29:19.620
FUTURE IS THAT WE'RE GETTING.

01:29:19.687 --> 01:29:21.389
OF FEES THAT WE'RE GONNA BE

01:29:21.456 --> 01:29:24.459
COLLECTING FROM THE PEOPLE WHO

01:29:24.525 --> 01:29:25.927

01:29:25.993 --> 01:29:27.295
MATERIALS AND TRANSPORTING THEM

01:29:27.361 --> 01:29:28.796
BUT THEN WE'RE PAYING OUR

01:29:28.863 --> 01:29:31.599
SHARE. TO CLEAN UP ALL THE PAST

01:29:31.666 --> 01:29:33.501
ACTIVITIES THAT HAVE GONE ON

01:29:33.568 --> 01:29:36.604
AND GET THAT 9210% MATCHING

01:29:36.671 --> 01:29:38.106

01:29:38.172 --> 01:29:40.141
YOU THERE ARE OTHER STATES. AND

01:29:40.208 --> 01:29:41.242
LEGISLATORS ARE MEETING THAT

01:29:41.309 --> 01:29:42.944

01:29:43.010 --> 01:29:45.079
WE PAY TEN PERCENT. THEY PAY

01:29:45.146 --> 01:29:47.115
90% WE GET HIM CLEANED UP AND

01:29:47.181 --> 01:29:48.649
THIS IS A WAY. NOT TO TAKE

01:29:48.716 --> 01:29:50.585
ANYTHING FROM THE EXCITED

01:29:50.651 --> 01:29:52.386
BECAUSE THE EXITE INCIDENT.

01:29:52.453 --> 01:29:53.921
SUCKS UP ALL THE OXYGEN BUT

01:29:53.988 --> 01:29:56.424
THERE ARE THOUSANDS HUNDREDS OF

01:29:56.491 --> 01:29:57.658
THOUSANDS OF THE SITE'S IN

01:29:57.725 --> 01:29:59.427
EVERYONE OF OUR DISTRICT THAT

01:29:59.494 --> 01:30:01.162
NEEDS THE ATTENTION AND THIS IS

01:30:01.229 --> 01:30:02.830
A PATHWAY TO GET THERE SO. I

01:30:02.897 --> 01:30:05.032
HOPE MY COLLEAGUES CONSIDERED

01:30:05.099 --> 01:30:06.567
THAT IN THE FUTURE SOME OF THE

01:30:06.634 --> 01:30:07.568
SITES IN THEIR DISTRICTS HAVE

01:30:07.635 --> 01:30:08.803
NOT BEEN IDENTIFIED AND THEY

01:30:08.870 --> 01:30:10.505
ARE ACTING THEY ARE. FORMER

01:30:10.571 --> 01:30:12.073
INDUSTRIAL DAY YOU KNOW THEY

01:30:12.140 --> 01:30:13.341
DON'T HAVE A RESPONSIBLE PARTY

01:30:13.407 --> 01:30:14.509
THAT'S THE PROBLEM WE DON'T

01:30:14.575 --> 01:30:16.010
KNOW WHO'S GONNA PAY FOR THIS

01:30:16.077 --> 01:30:18.012
SO. UNFORTUNATELY WE IN

01:30:18.079 --> 01:30:19.080
GOVERNMENT HAVE TO DO UP AT

01:30:19.147 --> 01:30:21.682

ADDITIONALLY IT IS PERSPECTIVE

02:47:47.123 --> 02:47:49.125
SO THAT IT'S NOT ONLY BASED ON

02:47:49.192 --> 02:47:50.727
THE FACT THAT YOU HAD NOT PAID

02:47:50.794 --> 02:47:52.061
