EACH OF THESE COMPLEXES INDIVIDUALLY NEGOTIATED AND IS UNIQUE TO EACH TRIBE WITH THE CORE GOALS OF SUPPORTING STRONG SELF SUFFICIENT TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS. AND FUNDING ESSENTIAL GOVERNMENT SERVICES TO TRAVEL CITIZENS FOREVER REVENUES GENERATED THROUGH THEIR CASINOS. ECONOMIC PROVISIONS OF THE CONTACTS YOU TO ADDRESS THE INDIVIDUAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND MARKETS OF EACH TRIBE FOR MAKING SURE NOT TO DISPROPORTIONATELY BENEFIT. ANYONE TRIED WHEN LOOKING AT THE UNIVERSE OF COMPAQ'S. CORE TO THIS APPROACH WAS ENSURING THAT EACH TRIBE IS THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE FACILITY AS INTENDED BY THE INDIAN GAMING REGULATORY ACT. AND THAT THE CONTACTS PROVIDE FOR FAIR REIMBURSEMENT FOR STATE REGULATORY COSTS. IT IS THE SPECIAL DISTRIBUTION FUND OR STF. AS WELL AS REVENUE SHARING TO THE REVENUE SHARING TRUST FUND AND TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUNDS WITH LIMITED. AND NON GAMING TRIBES. THE I. OWN BAND ME WALKING. COME IS THE FIRST CALL FOR THE TRI.

THE OTHER CORE PROVISIONS OF THE COMPACT INCLUDING TERMS ONLY TO LICENSING REGULATORY OVERSIGHT LABOR PUBLIC HEALTH. IN SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OR SUBSTANTIALLY LIKE THE CABINS ON COMPACT RATIFIED BY THIS BODY LAST YEAR. THIS SIMILARITY INCLUDES PROTECTIONS AGAINST WORKPLACE DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT PROVISIONS TO ADOPTING COMPLY WITH THE FEDERAL FAIR LABOR STANDARDS ACT INCLUSION OF THE TRIBE WILL ADOPT THE STANDARD TRIBAL LABOR RELATIONS ORDINANCE. THE CONTACTS ALSO INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REVIEW AND MITIGATION WITH LESS INTENSIVE PROCESS THESE IF THE TRIBE OPERATES UNDER THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY DEVICES.

INTO THE GALLERY WELCOME THE CHAIR WOMAN OF THE WE WALK IN INTO NASCAR TO PROVIDE HER TEST MARC THANK YOU. THANK YOU. INTERMENT GRAHAM MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M SCARED THAT'S TEACHER PERSON FOR THE I AM BAD AT ME WALK INDIANS WE HAVE THE TRIBE I THINK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY AND I'LL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF. I AM ENEMY WALK INDIANS IS LOCATED IN RURAL AMADOR COUNTY NOT TOO FAR FROM HERE. AND IT'S AN AREA WHERE WE'VE CALLED HOME FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS. WITHIN A ROLL MEMBERSHIP OF OVER SEVEN HUNDRED AND FIFTY CITIZENS. WE ARE THE LARGEST TRIBE IN OUR REGION. AND WE ARE PRESENTLY NOT ENGAGED IN GAMING. LIKE SO MANY OF OUR SISTER NATIONS IN CALIFORNIA. R. TRIED HISTORY IS QUITE TRAGIC INVOLVING A CENTRAL ON EFFORT TO SOLIDIFY GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES. I DON'T THINK YOU'RE A HOMELAND CAPABLE OF SUPPORTING OUR GOVERNMENT AND OUR TRIBAL MEMBER POPULATION. I'M PROUD TO SAY THAT THROUGH THE EFFORTS OF SEVERAL GENERATIONS OF LEADERSHIP AND CITIZENS WERE ABLE TO RESTORE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP WITH THE UNITED STATES NINETEEN NINETY FOUR. AND JUST ON MARCH TWENTIETH OF THIS YEAR WE RESTORED OUR VERY FIRST TRIBAL TRUST LANDS TWO HUNDRED TWENTY ACRES IN AMADOR COUNTY RIGHT OUTSIDE THE CITY OF PLYMOUTH. OF COURSE THESE LONG EFFORTS HAVE NOT COME OUT COME WITHOUT A SIGNIFICANT COST. HIGH PROPERTY VALUES IN OUR REGION COMBINED WITH THE COST TO UNDERGO THE FEDERAL FEE TO TRUST PROCESS. AND HERE'S A LITIGATION DEFENDING ARE FEDERALLY RECOGNIZED STATUS AND OR RATE TO RESTORE A LAND BASED. HAVE LEFT US WITH CONSIDERABLE DEBT. FURTHER A BLOCK OF LAND BASED AND SUFFICIENT FUNDING AND HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY CONSTRAINED OUR EFFORTS TO DEVELOP CRITICAL PROGRAMS AND RESOURCES TO MEET THE NEEDS OF OUR CITIZENS. RIVAL GAMING IS OUR ONLY HOPE FOR MEETING OUR OBLIGATIONS AND BEGINNING TO BUILD A ROBUST IN SUPPORT OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENT THAT OUR CITIZENS DESERVE. TODAY I URGE THE COMMITTEE TO SUPPORT OUR RECENTLY NEGOTIATED AND AGAIN VERY FIRST TRIBAL STATE GAMING COMPACT. THAT WE'RE THE ONLY TRIED SPEAKING WITH YOU TODAY THAT IS NOT ALREADY ENGAGED IN GAMING. WE ARE NO STRANGERS TO THE PASTA IN COMPACT THAT TRIBAL GAMING HAS HAD ON THE COMMUNITY. GAMINE VASTLY CHANGES THE ECONOMIC CLIMATE AROUND TRIBAL LANDS IT CREATES JOBS AND SECONDARY REVENUE BENEFITING NOT ONLY IN INDIA COUNTRY. BUT OUR NEIGHBORING COMMUNITIES. ONLY REVENUE GENERATED FROM GAMING OPERATIONS ALLOW STRIVE TO DEVELOP PROGRAMS TO SUPPORT THEIR CITIZENS GENERAL WELFARE SOCIAL SERVICES EDUCATION ESSENTIAL SERVICES PROTECTION OF CULTURAL RESOURCES. AND ALLOWS US TO SISTER NON TRIBAL NEIGHBORS THREW GRANT OTHER PROGRAMS THAT SUPPORT THE COMMUNITY AT LARGE. THESE ARE PRECISELY THE SAME GOALS WE HOPE TO ACHIEVE WITH OUR OWN GAMING OPERATIONS. AT THE END BRIEFLY MENTIONED COMPACT AUTHOR UP TO TWELVE HUNDRED CLASS THREE GAMING MACHINES AS WELL AS VARIOUS OTHER FORMS OF GAMING. ITSELF FORTH MEANINGFUL CONSUMER PROTECTION. EXCUSE ME CONSUMER AND EMPLOYEE YOU PROTECTIONS IT CONTAINS PROVISIONS FOR THE MEDICATION OF OFF RESERVATION IMPACTS OF THE GAMING FACILITY. IT DEMONSTRATES OUR STRONG COMMITMENT TO REVENUE SHARING THROUGH THE R. S. T. F. AND TRIBAL NATION GRANT FUND IN FUTURE YEARS FUNDS THAT WE HAVE DEPENDED ON VERY SIGNIFICANTLY AS A NON GAMING TRIBES FOR A LONG TIME. IT REFLECTS THE TRIBES PLEDGE TO SUPPORT AND INVESTMENT IN THE LOCAL COMMUNITY FOR IMPROVED EMERGENCY SERVICES LAW ENFORCEMENT IN INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT. ALL DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE AMADOR COUNTY COMMUNITY AS A WHOLE. AND OF COURSE THE COMPACT PROVIDES THE TRIBE WITH THE MEANS OF GENERATING REVENUE THAT WE CAN USE TO ESTABLISH. LONG TERM ECONOMIC SELF SUFFICIENCY AND PROSPERITY FOR TRIBAL GOVERNMENT AND FOR OUR CITIZENS. GAMING OPERATIONS WILL GENERATE REVENUE THAT WE WILL USE TO SUPPORT OUR SOCIAL AND EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS HOUSING HEALTH CARE AND THE PRESERVATION OF OUR CULTURAL RESOURCES. I THINK THAT WE HAVE STRUGGLED AND WE STILL STRUGGLE TO MAINTAIN. THIS IS INDEED A VERY EXCITING TIME FOR THE TRIBE. I'D LIKE TO THANK GOVERNOR NOOSES OFF NEWSOME'S OFFICE AND IN PARTICULAR IN A MARK FOR HER PROFESSIONALISM AND INTEGRITY AS WE WORK TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON THE CONTACT.
