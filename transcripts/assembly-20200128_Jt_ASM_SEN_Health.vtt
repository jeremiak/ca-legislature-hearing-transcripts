00:38:26.237 --> 00:38:29.040
THINK AND- PERHAPS MAYBE. WE

00:38:29.106 --> 00:38:30.041
CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION THE

00:38:30.107 --> 00:38:33.310

00:38:48.826 --> 00:38:50.661
FAIRLY SMALL SUBSET OF TOTAL

00:38:50.728 --> 00:38:52.797
BUILDINGS. OF ALL OF. THIS SO

00:38:52.863 --> 00:38:55.900
I. I WOULD BE PARTICULARLY. PER

00:38:55.966 --> 00:38:57.134

TO SB C. FORTY. WELL THAT WAS

00:39:56.293 --> 00:39:58.529
VERY BUILDING SPECIFIC- FOR

00:39:58.596 --> 00:39:59.797

00:40:07.605 --> 00:40:09.673
THESE ARE HAVE A QUITE A- OF

00:40:09.740 --> 00:40:10.875

00:40:37.568 --> 00:40:38.836
FORTY WITH ANY STRUCTURAL WORK

00:40:38.903 --> 00:40:40.538
AT ALL JUST SHARPENING THEIR

00:40:40.604 --> 00:40:42.339
PENCILS AND SHOWING THAT THE

00:40:42.406 --> 00:40:45.743
BUILDING I WORK AS IS- THAT IS

00:40:45.810 --> 00:40:47.311
NOT THE CASE FOR THE MEN IN THE

00:40:47.378 --> 00:40:51.081
PUBLIC MOST OLDER IT CHOOSE

00:40:51.148 --> 00:40:53.551
THE BILL. OPPOSED TO THE- ORDER

00:40:53.617 --> 00:40:55.019
TO MOVE THE SERVICES TO

00:40:55.085 --> 00:40:55.619
DIFFERENT BILL. THAN THEIR OWN

00:40:55.686 --> 00:40:56.821
MOST LIKELY BE SOME WORK

00:40:56.887 --> 00:40:58.556
INVOLVED BUT WHAT WE'RE ALSO

00:40:58.622 --> 00:40:59.723
FINDING OUT IS THAT IS

00:40:59.790 --> 00:41:01.258
HOSPITALS DO THIS WORK. THEY

00:41:01.325 --> 00:41:03.594
REALIZE THAT IS IT'S A GOOD

00:41:03.661 --> 00:41:04.328
TIME TO START REPLACING

00:41:04.395 --> 00:41:06.697
INFRASTRUCTURE THOSE ARE AGING-

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:09.900
UGH I'M THE IT ALSO REALLY

00:41:09.967 --> 00:41:11.769
FALL. IN BRING THE POSSIBLE UP

00:41:11.836 --> 00:41:13.971
TO MORE MODERN HEALTHCARE

00:41:14.038 --> 00:41:18.776
CAPABILITIES- NEWER EQUIPMENT-

00:41:18.843 --> 00:41:19.343
BECAUSE OF THAT NATURE SO.

00:41:19.410 --> 00:41:20.678
SOMETIMES TO PARSE HOW MUCH OF

00:41:20.744 --> 00:41:23.247
THAT. IS I SEISMIC RELATED AND

00:41:23.314 --> 00:41:23.881
HOW MUCH IS BECAUSE THE

00:41:23.948 --> 00:41:26.283
HOSPITAL HAS OTHER. REASONS FOR

00:41:26.350 --> 00:41:26.884
DOING THE DIGITAL WORKS WITH

00:41:26.951 --> 00:41:29.587
THE FORM AT THE SAME TIME. ALSO

00:41:29.653 --> 00:41:31.856
THERE IS A QUORUM THAT AS A DO

00:41:31.922 --> 00:41:34.491
THIS WORK. IF THE BUILDING DOES

00:41:34.558 --> 00:41:36.293
NOT CURLY MEET ALL OF THE

00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.429
STATE'S ACCESSIBILITY STANDARDS

00:41:38.495 --> 00:41:39.830
FOR WHAT THE BUILDINGS. MUST

00:41:39.897 --> 00:41:42.132
ALSO CORPORATE THE WORK. WITH

00:41:42.199 --> 00:41:44.835
THE COST. SO IT'S DIFFICULT-

00:41:44.902 --> 00:41:46.904
IT'S LIKE A SEA TO GIVE US AN

00:41:46.971 --> 00:41:50.407
ACTUAL COSTS ON A PER BASS

00:41:50.474 --> 00:41:54.144
BECAUSE EVERY. I WILL BE HAVE

00:41:54.211 --> 00:41:56.213
NOT REQUIREMENTS. PLEASE BE ON

00:41:56.280 --> 00:41:57.982
THE WHOLE LIFE LOCATION THE

00:41:58.048 --> 00:42:00.451
BUILDING SINCE I ARE MORE

00:42:00.517 --> 00:42:01.552
SEISMICALLY PRONE OTHER LOW.

00:42:01.619 --> 00:42:02.653
ALSO IF YOU'RE RIGHT ON SENATOR

00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.488
THIS FALL YOU'RE GONNA HAVE A

00:42:04.555 --> 00:42:06.190
MUCH HIGHER STANDARD TO MEET

00:42:06.257 --> 00:42:07.892
THEN IF YOU'RE IN A VERY LOW

00:42:07.958 --> 00:42:10.027
SEISMIC SONG OKAY SO JUST TO

00:42:10.094 --> 00:42:12.830
CLEAR THANKS THAT'D YOUR LAST

00:42:12.897 --> 00:42:14.965
REMARK. YOU MAY NOTICE.

00:42:15.032 --> 00:42:17.167
DIFFERENT DO HAVE- DIFFERENT

00:42:17.234 --> 00:42:19.770
SEISMIC RISK SELL FOR EXAMPLE

00:42:19.837 --> 00:42:21.772
BEING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. I'LL

00:42:21.839 --> 00:42:24.141
BE A FAULT SON YOU KNOW TO THE

00:42:24.208 --> 00:42:27.544
EAST TO THE WEST BUT NO OVER

00:42:27.611 --> 00:42:28.779
MORE WITH A FLOOD HERE VERSES

00:42:28.846 --> 00:42:31.982
WITH THE BUILDING THE EFFORTS

00:42:32.049 --> 00:42:33.884
TO GO AREN'T OTHER. ISMS SO IN

00:42:33.951 --> 00:42:36.053
TERMS OF THE- DEANDRE SINCE THE

00:42:36.120 --> 00:42:37.688
SEISMIC REQUIREMENTS TODAY

00:42:37.755 --> 00:42:39.623
ACTUALLY TAKE ACCOUNT OF THE

00:42:39.690 --> 00:42:41.659
SEISMIC RISK SO IT'S THIS SO

00:42:41.725 --> 00:42:43.027
IT'S A LITTLE DIFFERENT IF YOU

00:42:43.093 --> 00:42:43.961
BUILT A HOSPITAL ONE LOCATION

00:42:44.028 --> 00:42:46.363
VERSUS ANOTHER LOCATION YES SIR

00:42:46.430 --> 00:42:49.166
PART OF THE- OF. THE VALUATION

00:42:49.233 --> 00:42:49.700
THAT MUST BE MADE BY THE

00:42:49.767 --> 00:42:50.701
HOSPITAL STRUCTURE ENGINEER IS

00:42:50.768 --> 00:42:53.070
BASED ON. THE ACTUAL LOCATION

00:42:53.137 --> 00:42:54.538
THE SEISMICITY OF THE LOCATION

00:42:54.605 --> 00:42:56.640
SO A BUILDINGS THAT'S IN A

00:42:56.707 --> 00:42:57.975
LOWER SEISMIC ZONE OR OR

00:42:58.042 --> 00:43:00.644
LOCATION THEN WILL HAVE A LOWER

00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:02.446
BASE YOUR- REQUIREMENT OR LOW

00:43:02.513 --> 00:43:03.647
REQUIREMENT THAT THEY WOULD

00:43:03.714 --> 00:43:05.149
HAVE TO DEAL WITH. THAT A

00:43:05.215 --> 00:43:06.951
BUILDING THAT IS LOCATED AND

00:43:07.017 --> 00:43:09.453
THEY ARE HIGHER SEISMIC ZONE. I

00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.355
SAW THE AD STANDARD TO WHAT HE

00:43:11.422 --> 00:43:12.823
DOES BILL I CHANGE VICE

00:43:12.890 --> 00:43:16.593
LOCATION OKAY. ALL RIGHT. AND

00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:19.229
THEN. YOU HOSPITAL BUILDINGS

00:43:19.296 --> 00:43:22.166
ARE ONLY S. PC THREE INSTEAD OF

00:43:22.232 --> 00:43:22.666
FOUR FIVE HAVE A GREATER

00:43:22.733 --> 00:43:23.600
CHALLENGE IN MEETING THE HIGHER

00:43:23.667 --> 00:43:25.970
LEVELS OF THE NPC REQUIREMENTS

00:43:26.036 --> 00:43:27.037
SO YET STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS

00:43:27.104 --> 00:43:29.039
NONSTRUCTURAL CRIMES STAR

00:43:29.106 --> 00:43:32.743
NEEDED BY TWENTY THIRTY. WELL

00:43:32.810 --> 00:43:34.311
IS IT OKAY WE ONE OF THE THINGS

00:43:34.378 --> 00:43:35.245
THAT THE OFFICE DID WAS IN THE

00:43:35.312 --> 00:43:37.514
TWENTY. SIXTEEN CODE WE

00:43:37.581 --> 00:43:39.183
INTRODUCED A NEW. CATEGORY OF

00:43:39.249 --> 00:43:40.284
NONSTRUCTURAL PERFORMANCE

00:43:40.351 --> 00:43:43.253
CALLED IN PC FORTY RIGHT AND

00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.457
THAT ONE IS VERY SIMILAR TO PC

00:43:46.523 --> 00:43:47.358
THREE WITH WITH ACTUALLY SOME

00:43:47.424 --> 00:43:49.927
ITEMS MOVED. SAMPLE UNDER IN

00:43:49.994 --> 00:43:51.695
THE PC PREVIOUSLY- THERE IS A

00:43:51.762 --> 00:43:53.797
REQUIREMENT THAT CABINETS IN

00:43:53.864 --> 00:43:54.398
CERTAIN LOCATIONS HAD TO BE.

00:43:54.465 --> 00:43:56.133
ANCHORED SUCH MATTER TO THE

00:43:56.200 --> 00:43:58.168
WALLS WHICH WOULD REQUIRE

00:43:58.235 --> 00:43:59.970
REMOVING THESE CABINETRY-

00:44:00.037 --> 00:44:02.106
DURING OPEN. PUTTING FRAMING

00:44:02.172 --> 00:44:07.745
AND INPUT LET'S BACK AND SO-

00:44:07.811 --> 00:44:08.679
WHAT WE CONCLUDED WAS THAT. IF

00:44:08.746 --> 00:44:09.279
THE CAT IS BUILT ON THE WALL

00:44:09.346 --> 00:44:11.415
NOW FIFTY OR SIXTY YEARS IS.

00:44:11.482 --> 00:44:12.216
AND THAT THAT WAS COSTS THAT

00:44:12.282 --> 00:44:13.851
MAY NOT NEED TO BE SPENT. SO

00:44:13.917 --> 00:44:15.386
THAT'S WHAT KIND OF PRODUCT IN

00:44:15.452 --> 00:44:17.654
PC FORTY- BECAUSE WE HAD A

00:44:17.721 --> 00:44:19.690
NUMBER OF YEARS BEHIND US NOW

00:44:19.757 --> 00:44:20.391
TO SEE WHAT WAS PRACTICAL

00:44:20.457 --> 00:44:21.592
BECAUSE LOSSES WHATEVER'S

00:44:21.658 --> 00:44:22.960
PRACTICAL SOCKS. WE HAD A SENSE

00:44:23.027 --> 00:44:25.195
OF SOMETIME TO DETERMINE WHAT

00:44:25.262 --> 00:44:26.497
WE'RE IT'S REALLY PRACTICAL TO

00:44:26.563 --> 00:44:28.866
BE DONE SO WE SAID IF. I'M NOT.

00:44:28.932 --> 00:44:31.468
ALL IN. IN A PATIENT WITH. BILL

00:44:31.535 --> 00:44:33.037
WOULD BLOCK A RE. EXCEPT THEN

00:44:33.103 --> 00:44:34.104
WE NEED TO MAKE SURE IT'S AN

00:44:34.171 --> 00:44:35.305
COULD PROPERLY OTHERWISE.

00:44:35.372 --> 00:44:37.041
BECOME IT'S GOOD TO GO. THAT'S

00:44:37.107 --> 00:44:39.209
EXAMPLE OKAY AND SO- WE HAVE

00:44:39.276 --> 00:44:40.611
MADE SOME. LIKE SEE SUBSTANTIAL

00:44:40.677 --> 00:44:43.313
CHANGES. TO MAKE THOSE TO THOSE

00:44:43.380 --> 00:44:44.748
MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR ALL SPC

00:44:44.815 --> 00:44:46.016
CATEGORIES ACROSS THE BOARD.

00:44:46.083 --> 00:44:49.887
OKAY PRECIADO AND THEN FINALLY-

00:44:49.953 --> 00:44:50.821
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE- THE-

00:44:50.888 --> 00:44:54.291
NBC REQUIREMENTS. AS WE KNOW AS

00:44:54.358 --> 00:44:55.793
WITH MY- YOUR HOSPITAL EIGHT

00:44:55.859 --> 00:44:58.162
AND IT'S CONNECT. TO ELECTRICAL

00:44:58.228 --> 00:45:00.030
LINES SEWER LINES WATER LINES

00:45:00.097 --> 00:45:05.202
BECAUSE AFTER ALL HOSPITALS

00:45:05.269 --> 00:45:06.770
NOT. AN ISLAND RIGHT AT. THE

00:45:06.837 --> 00:45:11.842
EXIT RIGHT. TO WHAT HERMANCE

00:45:11.909 --> 00:45:13.143
NOW IF YOU AN EARTHQUAKE THOSE

00:45:13.210 --> 00:45:14.478
THE COULD BE DISRUPT THEMSELF

00:45:14.545 --> 00:45:15.379
SO IT'S NOT WITHIN THE HOSPITAL

00:45:15.446 --> 00:45:16.780
IT'S THE CONNECTIONS TO THE

00:45:16.847 --> 00:45:21.351
HOSPITAL'S SO HE JUST SPEAK TO

00:45:21.418 --> 00:45:22.853
GIVEN THE STANDARDS OF A

00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:23.987
HOSPITAL OF YOU HAVE THAT

00:45:24.054 --> 00:45:26.023
EARTHQUAKE THAT HAPPENS NOW THE

00:45:26.090 --> 00:45:27.057
SEWER LINES IS DISRUPTED WATER

00:45:27.124 --> 00:45:30.127
LINES ARE DISRUPTED COLLINES

00:45:30.194 --> 00:45:31.662
OTHER THINGS. IT'LL IS STILL

00:45:31.728 --> 00:45:34.131
EXPECT TO OPERATE ON ITS OWN

00:45:34.198 --> 00:45:35.499
LIKE INDEPENDENTLY WITHOUT

00:45:35.566 --> 00:45:37.601
THOSE CONNECTIONS ARE WE CAN

00:45:37.668 --> 00:45:38.135
CAN YOU SPEAK TO WHAT THE

00:45:38.202 --> 00:45:40.170
REQUIREMENTS. ALL FOR THE

00:45:40.237 --> 00:45:41.872
HOSPITAL TO BE ABLE TO DO AN

00:45:41.939 --> 00:45:43.474
EVENT THAT THERE'S DAMAGE I

00:45:43.540 --> 00:45:44.908
MEAN OF THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT

00:45:44.975 --> 00:45:46.643
LEADS TO THE HOSPITAL PROVIDING

00:45:46.710 --> 00:45:50.714
SERVICES. YES SIR. OF NBC FIVE

00:45:50.781 --> 00:45:52.082
ADDRESSES THAT ISSUE AND THAT'S

00:45:52.149 --> 00:45:54.451
WHY SO BY TWENTY THIRTY ALL

00:45:54.518 --> 00:45:55.018
HOSPITALS HAVE TO BE IN PC

00:45:55.085 --> 00:45:58.522
FIVE. M. WHAT IS REQUIRED IS

00:45:58.589 --> 00:45:59.223
FOR EXAMPLE FOR FUEL FOR THE

00:45:59.289 --> 00:46:01.225
GENERATORS- THEY MUST HAVE SOME

00:46:01.291 --> 00:46:03.193
OF THE TWO HOURS A FEW ON HAND-

00:46:03.260 --> 00:46:04.862
THEY MUST HAVE STORAGE OF

00:46:04.928 --> 00:46:06.897
WATER- FOR PATIENTS STAFF AND

00:46:06.964 --> 00:46:09.066
VISITORS LIMITS HAVE STORED

00:46:09.133 --> 00:46:10.234
CAPABILITY. OF DEALING WITH THE

00:46:10.300 --> 00:46:12.536
BOYS STORY. BECAUSE THE SEWER

00:46:12.603 --> 00:46:14.404
LINES AS YOU SAID MAY BE BROKEN

00:46:14.471 --> 00:46:16.373
OR OR AND NOT USABLE- SO THE A

00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:18.408
TEN AS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

00:46:18.475 --> 00:46:20.310
AND WHATEVER'S PRACTICAL IT TO

00:46:20.377 --> 00:46:21.645
MAKE SURE THE HOSPITAL CANNOT

00:46:21.712 --> 00:46:27.017
RATE- BEYOND THE- THE EVENT- IF

00:46:27.084 --> 00:46:28.252
THOSE OTHER SERVICES THEY

00:46:28.318 --> 00:46:30.621
BECOME. DISABLED OR NOT

00:46:30.687 --> 00:46:32.456
AVAILABLE OKAY SO THE EIGHT SO

00:46:32.523 --> 00:46:33.757
THE CONCEPT IS THE HIGHEST

00:46:33.824 --> 00:46:35.792
LEVEL THAT A HOSPITAL SHOULD BE

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.361
OF THE OPERATIONAL FOR

00:46:37.427 --> 00:46:42.633
SOMETHING SOME TWO. IN ICE. AND

00:46:42.699 --> 00:46:48.605
SORT YES. WITH THE I. THAT I

00:46:48.672 --> 00:47:00.384
TWO THE NAFTA. IT'S REACHED.

00:47:00.450 --> 00:47:03.387
OTHER MEMBERS HAVE QUESTIONS.

00:47:03.453 --> 00:47:05.956
I'M I DO SO I DON'T KNOW PLEASE

00:47:06.023 --> 00:47:08.158
ADVICE ONE GIVE. TO RUN AWAY

00:47:08.225 --> 00:47:10.260
YET PLEASE- SO A COUPLE

00:47:10.327 --> 00:47:11.495
QUESTIONS A PERSONAL THANK YOU

QUESTIONS AS WELL- SO HOW DOES

00:47:18.468 --> 00:47:20.704
THE UPDATE HAS BUILDING CODE

00:47:20.771 --> 00:47:21.471
UPDATES THAT HAPPEN EVERY THREE

00:47:21.538 --> 00:47:24.708
YEARS A FACT- THIS PROCESS AND

00:47:24.775 --> 00:47:26.243
IN SEISMIC SAFETY FOR HOSPITALS.

00:47:26.310 --> 00:47:30.147
WELL AS I MENTIONED WE LOOK AT-

00:47:30.214 --> 00:47:32.816
WHAT APPROACHES CAN BE TAKEN.

00:47:32.883 --> 00:47:34.184
TO BE MORE COST EFFECTIVE FOR

00:47:34.251 --> 00:47:36.019
HOSPITALS TO COMPLY AND THROUGH

00:47:36.086 --> 00:47:37.988
THIS APPROACH- THERE WE HAVE

00:47:38.055 --> 00:47:40.524
HAD- HAS THIS INTRODUCED. WHICH

00:47:40.591 --> 00:47:42.659
IS A PROGRAM THAT WAS- CREATED

00:47:42.726 --> 00:47:44.962
INITIALLY BY FEMA. AND WE'VE

00:47:45.028 --> 00:47:47.931
ALSO- INTRODUCED AS PC FORTY-

00:47:47.998 --> 00:47:50.400
IN PC FORTY AND OTHERS AND WE

00:47:50.467 --> 00:47:52.869
DO THOSE THROUGH REGULATIONS-

00:47:52.936 --> 00:47:53.437
THROUGH THE BILLING CENTERS

00:47:53.503 --> 00:47:54.938
COMMISSION AND THERE IS A LIKE

00:47:55.005 --> 00:47:55.973
YOU SAID A THREE YEAR CYCLE

00:47:56.039 --> 00:47:57.774
THEN THERE'S AN INTRO EIGHTEEN

00:47:57.841 --> 00:47:59.876
MONTH CYCLE THAT WE CAN CATCH

00:47:59.943 --> 00:48:02.246
UP ON THINGS BUT- HOUSE AS-

00:48:02.312 --> 00:48:03.480
BILLS HAVE BEEN PASSED

00:48:03.547 --> 00:48:04.314
REGARDING HOSPITAL CITING

00:48:04.381 --> 00:48:06.984
SAFETY- SOMETIMES. THERE'S BEEN

00:48:07.050 --> 00:48:08.552
AN URGENCY AD THAT SUCH THAT

00:48:08.619 --> 00:48:10.587
THE BILL HAS. ALLOWED US ARE

00:48:10.654 --> 00:48:12.789
PROVIDED- US TO PROVIDE

00:48:12.856 --> 00:48:14.591
EMERGENCY REGULATIONS WHICH CAN

00:48:14.658 --> 00:48:16.460
BE DONE OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL.

00:48:16.526 --> 00:48:18.962
THREE YEAR CYCLE. BUT WE WOULD

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:20.897
LOOK AT THE- EVENTS THAT

00:48:20.964 --> 00:48:22.132
HAPPENED FOR EXAMPLE AND

00:48:22.199 --> 00:48:24.268
KATRINA. THEY HAD ISSUES WITH

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:25.869
GENERATORS BECAUSE THEY WERE IN

00:48:25.936 --> 00:48:27.704
THE FLOOD PLAIN. SO IS RESULT

00:48:27.771 --> 00:48:28.805
THAT WE PUT IN OUR BUILDING

00:48:28.872 --> 00:48:31.642
ABOUT. THAT ELEVATOR. DOLLARS

00:48:31.708 --> 00:48:33.977
I'M SORRY GENERATOR SO. HAVE

00:48:34.044 --> 00:48:34.711
YOU CANNOT BE IN THE FLOOD

00:48:34.778 --> 00:48:35.812
PLAIN THAT THEY HAD TO BE ABOVE

00:48:35.879 --> 00:48:37.147
THE FLOOD PLAIN. SO THAT IS ON

00:48:37.214 --> 00:48:41.618
THE BUILDING CODE- THE FIRE AND

00:48:41.685 --> 00:48:43.120
ALL THAT. THE BILL IS A HUNDRED

00:48:43.186 --> 00:48:44.454
OUTSIDE ERROR NOT HAVE THE

00:48:44.521 --> 00:48:45.289
PEOPLE OF SHUTTING SMALL FROM

00:48:45.355 --> 00:48:47.190
COMING THE BUILDINGS. SO WE'VE

00:48:47.257 --> 00:48:48.358
DOES ALLOW THAT AND THE CODE

00:48:48.425 --> 00:48:51.028
GOING FORWARD SO AS THESE-

00:48:51.094 --> 00:48:52.763
EMERGENCIES AND THESE-

00:48:52.829 --> 00:48:54.731
DISASTERS OCCUR. THERE WE DO

00:48:54.798 --> 00:48:58.235
LOOK AT ARE THE CODES- ADEQUATE

00:48:58.302 --> 00:49:00.103
TO COVER. THOSE EVENTS AND IF

00:49:00.170 --> 00:49:02.306
SO IF NOT THEN WE WILL- PUBLIC-

00:49:02.372 --> 00:49:05.475
CODE CHANGES TO THE BILLING

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:07.511
CENTERS COMMISSION. SO WHEN

00:49:07.577 --> 00:49:08.745
HOSPITALS RETROFITTING AS

00:49:08.812 --> 00:49:10.914
OPPOSED TO A REBUILDING. OUR

00:49:10.981 --> 00:49:12.816
THE SEISMIC- COMPLIANCE

00:49:12.883 --> 00:49:14.518
STANDARDS DIFFERENT- BASED ON

00:49:14.584 --> 00:49:16.820
THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE

00:49:16.887 --> 00:49:17.421
HOSPITAL OR WHAT'S BEEN

00:49:17.487 --> 00:49:19.389
RETROFITTED FOR EXAMPLE. MY

00:49:19.456 --> 00:49:22.125
DISTRICT IS RURAL. A LOT OF ONE

00:49:22.192 --> 00:49:24.594
IN TWO STORY WOODEN STRUCTURES-

00:49:24.661 --> 00:49:25.929
WITH THE RETROFIT REQUIREMENTS

00:49:25.996 --> 00:49:28.465
BASED ON. CURRENT CONSTRUCTION

00:49:28.532 --> 00:49:30.434
IN WHAT WHAT WHAT IS THAT WHAT

00:49:30.500 --> 00:49:33.070
IS THAT LOOK LIKE FOR. THE

00:49:33.136 --> 00:49:33.970
DIFFERENCE AND WE'RE NOT WE'RE

00:49:34.037 --> 00:49:35.205
NOT WE'RE NOT A LOT OF

00:49:35.272 --> 00:49:37.507
SKYSCRAPERS IN MY DISTRICT. YES

00:49:37.574 --> 00:49:38.909
YOUR CORRECT THAT NEVER

00:49:38.975 --> 00:49:40.310
BUILDINGS HAVE DIFFERENT BILL.

00:49:40.377 --> 00:49:41.845
AND DIFFERENT STRUCTURE

00:49:41.912 --> 00:49:44.181
DEFICIENCIES AND I THINK THAT

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:45.649
WOULD BE. A SIX ESPECIALLY

00:49:45.716 --> 00:49:46.650
SINGLE STORY WOOD FRAME

00:49:46.717 --> 00:49:48.618
STRUCTURES HAVE FARED A FAIRLY

00:49:48.685 --> 00:49:50.087
WELL DURING EARTQUAKES AND NOT

00:49:50.153 --> 00:49:52.055
THAT MANY KNOWS THE THOSE- HAVE

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:54.658
COLLAPSED- IN AND SO TO THAT

00:49:54.725 --> 00:49:56.727
EXTENT OF WHAT THE OFFICE IS

00:49:56.793 --> 00:49:59.563
PROPOSING TO DO. IS TO LOOK AT

00:49:59.629 --> 00:50:01.565
THOSE KINDS OF STRUCTURES THE

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.133
AND SEE IF THERE ARE THINGS

00:50:03.200 --> 00:50:05.869
THAT WE CAN DO SOME OF LIKE-

00:50:05.936 --> 00:50:06.570
RESIDENTIAL THERE ARE SOME

00:50:06.636 --> 00:50:08.238
PRESCRIPTIVE STANDARD

00:50:08.305 --> 00:50:09.039
RESIDENCES RESIDENTIAL

00:50:09.106 --> 00:50:10.607
CONSTRUCTION TO MEET. THE

00:50:10.674 --> 00:50:11.942
STANDARDS COULD WE COME UP WITH

00:50:12.008 --> 00:50:13.076
SOME PRESCRIPTIVE STANDARDS FOR

00:50:13.143 --> 00:50:15.445
THESE KIND OF BUILDINGS SO THAT

00:50:15.512 --> 00:50:17.681
THEY CAN- DO IT ON A LESS

00:50:17.748 --> 00:50:19.316
COSTLY. MORE COST EFFECTIVE

00:50:19.383 --> 00:50:22.486
MANNER. TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

00:50:22.552 --> 00:50:23.086
THE FACT THAT THESE BUILDINGS

00:50:23.153 --> 00:50:27.791
MAKE SURE. FOR BETTER AND

00:50:27.858 --> 00:50:29.693
THERE'S SOME. SUPPOSED TO A-

00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:31.828
NON DOCTOR CON THE OLD OF.

00:50:31.895 --> 00:50:32.462
MULTI STOREY BUILDING OR OTHER

00:50:32.529 --> 00:50:33.330
BILL THAT APPEARED BE MORE

00:50:33.397 --> 00:50:34.865
FRAGILE DURING AN EARTHQUAKE

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.867
AND HAVE MORE STRUCTURAL DAMAGE.

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:38.568
WELL THE X. I. BREAK BRING THAT

00:50:38.635 --> 00:50:41.171
UP BUT WHAT WHAT OUR PANELISTS

AREA OF THE HUMBLE COAST IS

00:50:46.777 --> 00:50:48.345
EXPERIENCE TO THE TOP TEN.

00:50:48.412 --> 00:50:51.314
EARTHQUAKES IN THE LAST TWENTY

00:50:51.381 --> 00:50:52.249
THIRTY FIFTY YEARS WHATEVER I'M

00:50:52.315 --> 00:50:53.683

00:50:53.750 --> 00:50:55.552
THE BUILDING OF A HOSPITAL. IN

00:50:55.619 --> 00:50:58.622
THEAT THE HOSPITAL REMAIN

00:50:58.688 --> 00:51:00.957
STANDING FIFTY PLUS YEARS LATER

00:51:01.024 --> 00:51:01.525
IT MADE ME THINK ABOUT YOUR

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:03.994
CABINET ON THE WALL. AND

THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE A

00:51:20.744 --> 00:51:22.512

THE COMMUNITY. TO A PARTIAL

00:53:43.219 --> 00:53:45.655
EVACUATION TO SPECIFIC LINES OF

RIDGECREST. WAS AFFECTED BY

00:53:53.897 --> 00:53:57.267
THE- EARTHQUAKE AND THAT IS A

00:53:57.334 --> 00:53:58.535
PERFECT EXAMPLE OF A PARTIAL

00:53:58.602 --> 00:54:00.503
EVACUATION WHERE THE EMERGENCY

00:54:00.570 --> 00:54:02.205

SOMETIMES TRANSPLANT PATIENTS

00:54:14.351 --> 00:54:16.786
ACTUALLY CAUSES MORE HARM. AND

00:54:16.853 --> 00:54:18.421
THE LAST BUT NOT LEAST OUR LAST

00:54:18.488 --> 00:54:20.023

01:04:37.240 --> 01:04:38.741
OPERATIONAL LIKE CITY HALL

01:04:38.808 --> 01:04:40.276
MIGHT BE COMING DOWN THE FIRE

01:04:40.343 --> 01:04:44.180
TO. THE OFFICE OR THE POLICE

01:04:44.247 --> 01:04:46.182
STATION MIGHT BE COMING DOWN

01:04:46.249 --> 01:04:48.284
SO- AND I DON'T KNOW IN YOUR

01:04:48.351 --> 01:04:51.287
EXPERIENCE NAPA SO WHAT THAT

01:04:51.354 --> 01:04:53.155
MEANS FOR A HOSPITAL. OPERATOR

01:04:53.222 --> 01:04:54.790
THIS BOOK BUT ALL THOSE WERE

01:04:54.857 --> 01:04:59.862
THE FEW MAJOR POP. THESE THAT

01:04:59.929 --> 01:05:01.364

AFTER DISASTERS ACTUALLY AND SO

01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.276
THE FACT THAT THAT DID THE

THE SEISMIC EVENTS AS- IS

01:05:19.749 --> 01:05:22.084
REALLY INTERESTING BECAUSE IT'S

01:05:22.151 --> 01:05:22.718
NOT JUST CITY HALL OF THE FIVE.

01:05:22.785 --> 01:05:23.319

SANTA MONICA. CALIFORNIA IT'S

01:11:02.992 --> 01:11:04.526
IMPORTANT FOR ME TO EMPHASIZE

01:11:04.593 --> 01:11:07.663
NOT A WE'RE AN INDEPENDENT

OR- ASSOCIATION I'M GONNA BE

01:11:13.469 --> 01:11:14.970
RISING RESULTS OF A STUDY I

01:11:15.037 --> 01:11:16.071
COULD LEAD RAND WAS SPONSORED

01:11:16.138 --> 01:11:17.439
BY THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL

01:11:17.506 --> 01:11:19.842
ASSOCIATION THE PRIMARY

01:11:19.908 --> 01:11:22.544
OBJECTIVE OF THE STUDY WAS TO

01:11:22.611 --> 01:11:24.647
PROVIDE AN UPDATE TO RANT

01:11:24.713 --> 01:11:26.415
PREVIOUS. HI OF COMPLYING.

01:11:26.482 --> 01:11:29.718
THIRTY THAT. SB NINETY FIFTY

01:11:29.785 --> 01:11:31.220
TWO. OUR STUDY ALSO EXAMINE THE

01:11:31.286 --> 01:11:32.721
AFFORDABILITY THE HOSPITALS OF

01:11:32.788 --> 01:11:34.223
THIS ANTICIPATED SPENDING AS

01:11:34.289 --> 01:11:36.525
WELL AS OPPORTUNITY FOR AN

01:11:36.592 --> 01:11:38.627
CHALLENGES TO COMPLIANCE. I'M

01:11:38.694 --> 01:11:40.896
AS WE'VE SEEN OF NINETEEN FIFTY

01:11:40.963 --> 01:11:41.563
THREE REQUIRES A BY TWENTY

01:11:41.630 --> 01:11:43.732
THIRTY. HOSPITAL BUILDINGS THE

01:11:43.799 --> 01:11:45.768
PROVIDED TO CARE SERVICES MUST

01:11:45.834 --> 01:11:47.670
BE ABLE TO REMAIN OPERATIONAL

01:11:47.736 --> 01:11:51.740
AFTER AN EARTHQUAKE. I CAN SKIP

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:53.575
A LOT OF THIS ABOUT WHAT THEY

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:56.912
<i>EED TO DO- I'LL JUST ADD IT WE</i>

01:11:56.979 --> 01:11:58.714
ASSUME THAT ALL SPC ONE

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:00.416
BUILDINGS WOULD BE REMOVED FROM

01:12:00.482 --> 01:12:01.583
ACUTE CARE SERVICES AND DO NOT

01:12:01.650 --> 01:12:04.319
INCLUDE THEM IN OUR PROCESS. SO

01:12:04.386 --> 01:12:05.387
WE PRODUCE TO COST ESTIMATES

01:12:05.454 --> 01:12:06.622
THAT WERE DESIGNED TO REPRESENT

01:12:06.689 --> 01:12:08.057
THE UPPER AND LOWER BOUND TO

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:11.226
FUTURE COSTS THE LOW END

01:12:11.293 --> 01:12:12.661
ESTIMATE IS FOR UPGRADING

01:12:12.728 --> 01:12:14.596
ENTIRELY THROUGH RETROFITTING

01:12:14.663 --> 01:12:17.066
OF EXISTING. BUILDINGS

01:12:17.132 --> 01:12:18.634
INVESTMENT FOR STRUCTURAL

01:12:18.701 --> 01:12:20.035
UPGRADING IS ENTIRELY THROUGH

01:12:20.102 --> 01:12:21.804
NEW CONSTRUCTION OF REPLACEMENT

01:12:21.870 --> 01:12:24.173

01:12:24.239 --> 01:12:25.808
WITH NONSTRUCTURAL UPGRADING

01:12:25.874 --> 01:12:28.077
THROUGH RETROFITTING OF ALL

01:12:28.143 --> 01:12:29.545
BUILDINGS THAT REQUIRE ONLY

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:32.247
NONSTRUCTURAL SO IN OTHER WORDS

01:12:32.314 --> 01:12:33.716
BE FACING STRUCTURAL AND

01:12:33.782 --> 01:12:36.185
UPGRADING WAS IT ONLY NEED

01:12:36.251 --> 01:12:38.587
NONSTRUCTURAL WE USE THIS

01:12:38.654 --> 01:12:39.154
BRACKETING APPROACH BECAUSE

01:12:39.221 --> 01:12:40.723
MOST. AS WE WITH IN THAT THEY

01:12:40.789 --> 01:12:41.957
DID NOT YET KNOW WHETHER THEY

01:12:42.024 --> 01:12:44.126
WOULD PURSUE RETROFITTING

01:12:44.193 --> 01:12:46.595
REPLACEMENT OR SOME COMBINATION

01:12:46.662 --> 01:12:50.232

STATEWIDE REQUIRED- SEISMIC

01:12:55.104 --> 01:12:58.340
UPGRADING. WE ESTIMATED THAT

01:12:58.407 --> 01:12:59.475
THE STATE WIDE COST FOR

HOSPITALS COULD AFFORD THIS

01:13:29.671 --> 01:13:31.373
ESTIMATED SPENDING WE RATED

APPLYING THE SCORING SYSTEM WE

01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.162
FOUND THAT 22% OF CALIFORNIA

THE HOSPITAL BUT IT WAS

01:19:03.271 --> 01:19:04.439
CERTAINLY ENOUGH TO GET US TO

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:06.041
AT LEAST BE SAFE FOR THE TWENTY

TWENTY REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE.

01:19:08.176 --> 01:19:09.244
OUR FIRST PRIORITY AND THEN WE

01:19:09.311 --> 01:19:10.879
CHOSE THE EMERGENCY IN SURGERY

01:19:10.946 --> 01:19:13.682

PRIOR PANEL. EACH HOSPITAL SITE

01:29:08.543 --> 01:29:09.977
DEFERRED OFF PUT MORE IS I'M

01:29:10.044 --> 01:29:11.646
NOT A STRUCTURAL ENGINEER BUT I

01:29:11.713 --> 01:29:14.515
THINK- AS WE HAVE- MATURE TO

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:17.685
SEISMIC MANDATE- PARTICULARLY

01:29:17.752 --> 01:29:19.721
THE US STAY STANDING MANDATE-

01:29:19.787 --> 01:29:22.123
SO HAVE THE REQUIREMENTS I

01:29:22.190 --> 01:29:24.025
THINK WE ARE NOW DOWN TO A

01:29:24.092 --> 01:29:26.728
PLACE WHERE. WE WHEN YOU TALK

01:29:26.794 --> 01:29:29.397
FULLY OPERATIONAL- AND WHAT IS

01:29:29.464 --> 01:29:30.798
OPERATIONAL EXCUSE ME REASON

01:29:30.865 --> 01:29:32.767
WHAT FOR CATIA OPERATIONAL IT

01:29:32.834 --> 01:29:35.803
NOW GETS DOWN TO- WHETHER THE

01:29:35.870 --> 01:29:36.904
BUILDING WILL BE ABLE TO

01:29:36.971 --> 01:29:38.940
OPERATE AFTER A DISASTER AND I

01:29:39.006 --> 01:29:42.677
AND I ALWAYS STRUGGLE WITH.

01:29:42.744 --> 01:29:43.277
FOLKS AT THE STATE AND I HOUSE

01:29:43.344 --> 01:29:45.613
HOW OPERATED WITH THE BUILDINGS

01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:47.582
WE HAVE TODAY AFTER DISASTERS.

01:29:47.648 --> 01:29:49.784
SO I THINK THAT OUR SQUAD

01:29:49.851 --> 01:29:51.252
STRUGGLING OR OUGHT NOT SHOWING

01:29:51.319 --> 01:29:53.154
OFF BODS WORKING FOR STANDARD

01:29:53.221 --> 01:29:54.088
THAT FROM AN ENGINEERING

01:29:54.155 --> 01:29:55.923
STANDPOINT. I'M CAN ASSURE THAT

01:29:55.990 --> 01:29:58.993
LEVEL OF SECURITY- AND I THINK

01:29:59.060 --> 01:30:00.628
WE APPRECIATE THAT BUT AT THE

01:30:00.695 --> 01:30:01.696
SAME TIME OUR HOSPITALS HAVE.

01:30:01.763 --> 01:30:02.797
SCHOOL EXPERIENCE OF HAVING

01:30:02.864 --> 01:30:04.632
SURVIVED VARIOUS DIFFERENT

01:30:04.699 --> 01:30:07.235
DISASTERS WITH THE STRUCTURES

01:30:07.301 --> 01:30:10.738
WE HAVE TODAY SO WE CAN

01:30:10.805 --> 01:30:12.607
PROBABLY TAKE A LOOK BASS- THE-

01:30:12.673 --> 01:30:13.975
MANDATE SHORED. I THINK WHAT

01:30:14.041 --> 01:30:14.842
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND IS THE

01:30:14.909 --> 01:30:16.511
BALANCE BETWEEN WHAT WE- WHAT

01:30:16.577 --> 01:30:18.212
WE KNOW WE DO IN DISASTERS

01:30:18.279 --> 01:30:20.148
ALREADY. WITH THE STRUCTURES

01:30:20.214 --> 01:30:23.017
AND WE HAVE TODAY- KNOWING THAT

01:30:23.084 --> 01:30:25.486
THEY'LL STAY STANDING- AND WHAT

01:30:25.553 --> 01:30:27.989
IS ENGINEERING WISE THE RIGHT.

THE STRUCTURAL- PIECE

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:01.622
REPRESENTS- WHAT WE SEE IS THAT

01:36:01.689 --> 01:36:03.791
LARGER FINANCIAL SORT OF STEEL

01:36:03.858 --> 01:36:05.493
BEAMS AND CONSTRUCTION PIECE

AS WELL WE SORT OF PUT IT IN A

01:36:11.565 --> 01:36:13.634
COUPLE OF BUCKETS SO WE HAVE

01:36:13.701 --> 01:36:14.301
HOSPITALS THAT EVEN IF THEY-

01:36:14.368 --> 01:36:16.637
ARE. BEING FOR THE INITIAL

01:36:16.704 --> 01:36:19.773
PIECE- THEY HAVE SOME ISSUES

01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:21.742
WITH THEIR OF BEING LANDLOCKED

01:36:21.809 --> 01:36:23.477
AND MOVING SERVICES AROUND SO

01:36:23.544 --> 01:36:24.879
IF HOSPITALS THAT MIGHT HAVE

01:36:24.945 --> 01:36:26.680
SIX BUILDINGS AND YOU CAME OUT

UP WITH IT TO MOVE DOC RETURN.

01:36:53.841 --> 01:36:54.775
THE CAT EIGHT A FACT CAN BE

NONSTRUCTURAL CREATES. RACIAL

01:37:09.957 --> 01:37:11.058
CHALLENGES IT AND POP WOULD

IS GOING TO HAPPEN NOT IF IT'S

01:38:50.491 --> 01:38:51.792
GOING TO HAPPEN BASED ON. WHAT

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:54.361
GEOLOGISTS TELL US. AND SO-

01:38:54.428 --> 01:38:55.396
THAT IS TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION

01:38:55.462 --> 01:38:56.897
IN THE STRUCTURAL CAPACITY THE

01:38:56.964 --> 01:38:57.798
BILLING SECONDLY AS I

A COVER OF LATERAL RESISTANCE

01:39:08.142 --> 01:39:10.177
OR SEISMIC SAFETY. AND SO MANY

01:39:10.244 --> 01:39:11.211
OF THESE BUILDINGS HAVE

01:39:11.278 --> 01:39:13.947
STRUCTURAL WEAKNESSES. THAT IF.

01:39:14.014 --> 01:39:16.116
THEY ARE. EXPOSED TO THESE

01:39:16.183 --> 01:39:17.951
DESIGNER QUAKES- COULD HAVE

01:39:18.018 --> 01:39:20.821
CATASTROPHIC EVENT OF RESULTS.

01:39:20.888 --> 01:39:26.493
OKAY AND PERHAPS MAYBE- THE

01:39:26.560 --> 01:39:27.494
HOSPITAL'S MIGHT. AND IF YOU

01:39:27.561 --> 01:39:28.896
WANT A RISK. TO THAT TERMS OF

01:39:28.962 --> 01:39:30.364
FEAR CONVERSATIONS DAS POTTER

01:39:30.431 --> 01:39:32.132
WITH OTHER PEOPLE CONSULTANTS

01:39:32.199 --> 01:39:33.801

GOD FORBID. SOMETHING HAPPENS-

01:39:56.123 --> 01:39:56.757
WE'RE TRYING TO BALANCE THAT

01:39:56.824 --> 01:39:58.992

ABOUT THE RISKS THAT. THE YOUR

01:40:06.500 --> 01:40:08.869
TOP STRUCTURE HAS TO A LARGE

01:40:08.936 --> 01:40:10.037
EARTHQUAKE EVENT THAT MIGHT

THE RECENT CHANGES. HAS SOME OF

01:40:21.181 --> 01:40:22.349
THE EXAMPLES HE MENTIONED IN

01:40:22.416 --> 01:40:24.118

OUR BROOM CLOSETS THAT WE'RE

01:40:28.021 --> 01:40:29.690
GONNA HAVE TO TEAR UP THE WALL

01:40:29.757 --> 01:40:31.291
IN THE BROOM CLOSET. AND THEN

01:40:31.358 --> 01:40:32.726
DO WHAT AND IT DIDN'T MAKE

01:40:32.793 --> 01:40:34.795
SENSE SO WE'RE ACTED ABSOLUTELY

01:40:34.862 --> 01:40:42.436
NEXT CONVERSATION. SPEAKING

01:40:42.503 --> 01:40:45.005
ABOUT THE BIG. THE CALL ON THAT

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:46.940
SPECIFICALLY BUT IT SEEMS.

01:40:47.007 --> 01:40:48.108
UNIQUE THAT THE HOT. BEING TO

01:40:48.175 --> 01:40:49.076
BE ON KIND AT THE SAID OF THE

01:40:49.143 --> 01:40:50.010
ENTIRE SO. RIGHT AS A VERY NEW

01:40:50.077 --> 01:40:50.711
REQUIRED FOR HAAS. AND WE

HE LIKE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF

01:40:55.315 --> 01:40:56.350

OUR CASE WE ARE A STANDALONE

01:41:00.954 --> 01:41:03.123
PRIVATE HOSPITAL. WE DON'T HAVE

01:41:03.190 --> 01:41:05.058
ANY DISTRICTS SUPPORT. SO THAT

01:41:05.125 --> 01:41:07.461
PRESENTS A UNIQUE CHALLENGE

01:41:07.528 --> 01:41:08.362
OKAY AND I THINK AND IF THEY

01:41:08.429 --> 01:41:08.962

THAT TELLS US WE ARE IN A VERY

01:42:37.918 --> 01:42:42.923
LOW SEISMIC. AREA. WHICH MEANS

01:42:42.990 --> 01:42:45.592

SCHWARZENEGGER AS A SCREENING

01:45:33.827 --> 01:45:35.595
TOOL TO DETERMINE WHICH OF

01:45:35.662 --> 01:45:37.597
THESE SPC ONE BUILDINGS WERE

01:45:37.664 --> 01:45:39.199
THE WORST BUILDINGS THAT SHOULD

01:45:39.266 --> 01:45:40.534
HAVE IMMEDIATE ACTION TAKEN

01:45:40.600 --> 01:45:43.303
UPON THEM AND SO THAT SCREENING

01:45:43.370 --> 01:45:45.972
TOOL- DID NOT DRILL DOWN IN THE

01:45:46.039 --> 01:45:48.442
SITE SPECIFIC ASSIST FACILITY

01:45:48.508 --> 01:45:51.344
THAT- WE DON'T READ DRILL DOWN

01:45:51.411 --> 01:45:53.580
NOW ON WE HAD SOME DEALINGS FOR

01:45:53.647 --> 01:45:54.715
EXAMPLE THAT BECAME TO SEE TO

01:45:54.781 --> 01:45:55.515
BECAUSE THEY WERE ACTUALLY

01:45:55.582 --> 01:45:58.585
EVALUATED CALL VALUE IT. AND

01:45:58.652 --> 01:46:01.354
ALL ACTUALLY DRILL DOWN TO LOOK

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:01.822
AT AND EVALUATE THOSE

01:46:01.888 --> 01:46:03.223
STRUCTURES DO THEY HAVE STRUCK

01:46:03.290 --> 01:46:04.791
DEFICIENCIES THAT CAN STILL

01:46:04.858 --> 01:46:07.728
REMAINING THAT COULD RESULT IN

01:46:07.794 --> 01:46:12.099
A PARTIAL COLLAPSE OR A PAGE UP

01:46:12.165 --> 01:46:18.805
FOR UP. FROM THE BEST WAY FOR

01:46:18.872 --> 01:46:21.875
ME TO THIS TO READ. FROM FEMA

01:46:21.942 --> 01:46:23.410
WHAT THIRD OF A OF A DUE TO BE

01:46:23.477 --> 01:46:31.551
AS A I MAY. BRIEF. IN THE IN

01:46:31.618 --> 01:46:35.021
THE HOUSE. PROBE THEY THE UNTIL

01:46:35.088 --> 01:46:36.256
WAS TO CREATE THESE SEAT GO

01:46:36.323 --> 01:46:37.023
INTO WHAT'S CALL A LIFE SAFETY

01:46:37.090 --> 01:46:39.392
LAW AND THIS IS THE DEFINITION

01:46:39.459 --> 01:46:41.595
OF LYE SAFETY BY FEMA LIFE

01:46:41.661 --> 01:46:42.629
SAFETY MEANS THE POST

01:46:42.696 --> 01:46:44.698
EARTHQUAKE DAMAGE STATE IN

01:46:44.765 --> 01:46:46.366
WHICH SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE

01:46:46.433 --> 01:46:48.301
STRUCTURE HAS OCCURRED BUT SOME

01:46:48.368 --> 01:46:50.237
MARGIN AGAINST EITHER PARTIAL

01:46:50.303 --> 01:46:51.371
OR TOTAL STRUCTURAL COLLAPSE

01:46:51.438 --> 01:46:53.039
REMAINS SOME STRUCTURAL

01:46:53.106 --> 01:46:54.074
ELEMENTS AND COMPONENTS MAY BE

01:46:54.141 --> 01:46:56.276
SEVERELY DAMAGED BUT SHOULD NOT

01:46:56.343 --> 01:46:57.611
RESULT IN LARGE FALLING DEBRIS

01:46:57.677 --> 01:46:59.379
HAZARDS EITHER WITHIN OR

01:46:59.446 --> 01:47:02.015
OUTSIDE THE BUILDING INJURIES

01:47:02.082 --> 01:47:02.682
MAY OCCUR DURING THE EARTHQUAKE

01:47:02.749 --> 01:47:04.417
HOWEVER IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE

01:47:04.484 --> 01:47:05.318
OVERALL RISK OF LIFE

01:47:05.385 --> 01:47:06.386
THREATENING INJURIES. AS A

01:47:06.453 --> 01:47:08.054
RESULT OF STRUCTURAL DAMAGE IS

01:47:08.121 --> 01:47:09.956
LAW COST TO REPAIR THE

01:47:10.023 --> 01:47:12.125
STRUCTURE. HOWEVER FOR ECONOMIC

01:47:12.192 --> 01:47:13.293
REASONS THIS MAY NOT BE

01:47:13.360 --> 01:47:15.162
PRACTICAL WHY THE DAM

01:47:15.228 --> 01:47:16.263
INSTRUCTOR IS NOT AN EMINENT

01:47:16.329 --> 01:47:18.999
COPS RISK. IT WOULD BE PRUDENT

01:47:19.065 --> 01:47:19.633
TO IMPLEMENT STRUCTURAL REPAIRS

01:47:19.699 --> 01:47:21.701
OR INSTALL BRACING PRIOR TO RE

01:47:21.768 --> 01:47:24.204
OCCUPANCY AND THAT'S FROM FEMA

01:47:24.271 --> 01:47:24.838
TWO SEVENTY THREE THAT. THAT'S

01:47:24.905 --> 01:47:27.107
A SPICY TOO RIGHT AND THE

01:47:27.174 --> 01:47:28.809
OTHER. IT'S A YEAH THAT'S RISKY

01:47:28.875 --> 01:47:30.277
SEE TO READ AND THEN WE NEED TO

01:47:30.343 --> 01:47:33.413
MOVE PEOPLE SPC FOR OUR FOR A

01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:35.048
FORTY RIGHT EXACTLY WHICH FORTY

01:47:35.115 --> 01:47:36.550
THEM WOULD. REDUCE SOME OF

01:47:36.616 --> 01:47:37.751
THESE RICH THAT I MENTIONED ARE

01:47:37.818 --> 01:47:40.320
FINE- FOR STC TO BILLS. AND

01:47:40.387 --> 01:47:42.255
THAT'S TO REMAIN OPERATIONAL.

01:47:42.322 --> 01:47:43.623
AND I THINK WHAT WE'RE TRYING

01:47:43.690 --> 01:47:45.458
TO UNDERSTAND IN BALANCE IS

01:47:45.525 --> 01:47:47.661
WHAT IS IT AGAIN THE RISK TO

01:47:47.727 --> 01:47:49.896
THE PATIENT AND THE EMPLOYEE

01:47:49.963 --> 01:47:51.998
TO. SENATOR MY STANDARD VERSUS

01:47:52.065 --> 01:47:53.867
WHAT IT IS FULLY OPERATIONAL OR

01:47:53.934 --> 01:47:55.569
WHAT AN OPERATIONAL POST AN

01:47:55.635 --> 01:47:56.870
EARTHQUAKE AND THAT'S WHERE

01:47:56.937 --> 01:47:58.104
WE'RE TRYING TO FIND THAT

01:47:58.171 --> 01:48:00.006
BALANCE IS WHAT WE BUILDING TO-

01:48:00.073 --> 01:48:04.244
IS THE- BUILDING- SO GOING TO.

01:48:04.311 --> 01:48:06.446
BE IN A SPACE WHERE AFTER AN

01:48:06.513 --> 01:48:08.381
EARTHQUAKE IT'S NOT A- IT'S NOT

01:48:08.448 --> 01:48:09.216
JEOPARDY TO AND CAN STILL

01:48:09.282 --> 01:48:11.084
MANAGED SERVICES SO I THINK

01:48:11.151 --> 01:48:12.385
WHEN I. TRY TO DRILL DOWN

01:48:12.452 --> 01:48:15.555
THOUGH AND IT IS THAT I THINK

01:48:15.622 --> 01:48:21.161
YOU KNOW AGAIN. TWENTY THIRTY

01:48:21.228 --> 01:48:23.330
YEARS CAN BE OPERATION. SONNY

01:48:23.396 --> 01:48:25.098
THAT TERMS OF THE- SIZE THE

01:48:25.165 --> 01:48:26.233
AFTER WORRY ABOUT. YOU ARE LOW.

01:48:26.299 --> 01:48:27.567
AT NOT ONE SIZE FITS ALL ACROSS

01:48:27.634 --> 01:48:28.101
THE STATE YOU ARE TAKING

01:48:28.168 --> 01:48:28.768
ACCOUNT OF THE AXE SIZE RISK IN

01:48:28.835 --> 01:48:31.271
EACH INDIVIDUAL AREA. YES YOUR

01:48:31.338 --> 01:48:32.939
LETTER CORRECT. OKAY THAT'S

01:48:33.006 --> 01:48:34.307
THAT'S THE POINT I WAS TRYING

01:48:34.374 --> 01:48:35.775
TO CLARIFY AND THEN FINALLY-

01:48:35.842 --> 01:48:38.311
THAT- IS ALSO IS THAT WE TALKED

01:48:38.378 --> 01:48:39.813
ABOUT HOW STRUCTURAL IS THE BIG

01:48:39.880 --> 01:48:42.816
EXPENSE SO MOVING SB T. TO THE

01:48:42.883 --> 01:48:45.352
FORTY OR FIVE- BUT IN TERMS OF

01:48:45.418 --> 01:48:47.587
THE BURDEN OF ACTUALLY. BEYOND

01:48:47.654 --> 01:48:48.922
STRUCTURAL TRYING TO BE

01:48:48.989 --> 01:48:49.789
COMPLIANT WITH THE

01:48:49.856 --> 01:48:51.591
NONSTRUCTURAL STANDARDS. ARE

01:48:51.658 --> 01:48:53.493
THEIR MAJOR I MEAN I'M SURE

01:48:53.560 --> 01:48:54.761
THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS THAT

01:48:54.828 --> 01:48:56.696
SOME FINANCIAL BURDENS THAT HOW

01:48:56.763 --> 01:48:58.565
MUCH OF THAT CONCERN IS THAT SO

01:48:58.632 --> 01:49:00.333
ONCE YOU'VE GOT THE STRUCTURAL

01:49:00.400 --> 01:49:02.068
POINT THERE. THAN TRYING TO

01:49:02.135 --> 01:49:04.104
TRUSTS COME TO COMPLY TO

01:49:04.170 --> 01:49:05.872
NONSTRUCTURAL STANDARDS HOW

01:49:05.939 --> 01:49:08.241
MUCH OF A BURDEN IS THAT. IN

01:49:08.308 --> 01:49:10.410
OTHER REQUIRE. DO IT THE SAME

01:49:10.477 --> 01:49:12.312
TIME SO YOU DON'T REALLY

01:49:12.379 --> 01:49:13.513
SEPARATE THEM SO IF YOU HAVE A

01:49:13.580 --> 01:49:15.048
BUILDING SPC TO YOU DO THE

01:49:15.115 --> 01:49:16.750
NONSTRUCTURAL AS WELL SO IF

01:49:16.816 --> 01:49:18.018
YOU'RE REBUILDING YOU WOULD DO

01:49:18.084 --> 01:49:20.053
THE NONSTRUCTURAL AS WELL SURE

01:49:20.120 --> 01:49:22.689
RETROFITTING ANYONE OPENING. WE

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:23.990
HAVE A LOT OF MONEY BUT IF THE

01:49:24.057 --> 01:49:25.492
I MEAN WE A LOT OF PEOPLE FOR A

01:49:25.558 --> 01:49:26.927
FORTY YEAR RIGHT IT MIGHT BE A

01:49:26.993 --> 01:49:28.561
20% SO IF YOU'RE READY THERE SO

01:49:28.628 --> 01:49:30.363
NOW IT'S A PEOPLE READY AT FOR

01:49:30.430 --> 01:49:33.233
THE ARE FIVE THEY'RE FINE ARE

01:49:33.300 --> 01:49:35.035
AT THEIR DIVISIONAL INVESTMENTS

01:49:35.101 --> 01:49:37.270
THEY NEED TO MAKE TO. THE NYSE

01:49:37.337 --> 01:49:39.039
THEY MIGHT STILL HAVE BEEN PC

01:49:39.105 --> 01:49:39.973
TO DO BUT MOST OF THE TIME YOU

01:49:40.040 --> 01:49:41.374
DO IT TOGETHER OKAY WHAT ABOUT

01:49:41.441 --> 01:49:43.476
THIS FOR AWHILE OKAY SOUNDS

01:49:43.543 --> 01:49:44.277
THAT SOUNDS LIKE THE WELL

01:49:44.344 --> 01:49:47.547
THERE'S A BURDEN THAT SEEMS TO

01:49:47.614 --> 01:49:51.351
BE MANAGED. WELL WELL NOW THAT

01:49:51.418 --> 01:49:53.053
THAT'S QUITE YEAH THEIR LOVE WE

01:49:53.119 --> 01:49:54.587
TALKED OVER NON STROKE WRITING

01:49:54.654 --> 01:49:56.222
IF THIS AGAIN THIS IS WHERE YOU

01:49:56.289 --> 01:49:56.790
GET BY TO WHAT GOING ON WITH

01:49:56.856 --> 01:49:58.124
EACH DIFFERENT HOSPITAL SO YOU

01:49:58.191 --> 01:50:00.460
CAN HAVE A HOSPITAL THAT IS US

01:50:00.527 --> 01:50:02.996
THREE OR FOUR THAT HAS

01:50:03.063 --> 01:50:04.497
SIGNIFICANT NONSTRUCTURAL

01:50:04.564 --> 01:50:06.466
ISSUES AND NEED TO OPEN UP

01:50:06.533 --> 01:50:08.568
WALLS FOR THAT AND THIS IS

01:50:08.635 --> 01:50:09.402
WHERE I'M LOOKING AT PAUL ONLY

01:50:09.469 --> 01:50:11.037
BECAUSE I DON'T KNOW EVERY

01:50:11.104 --> 01:50:11.604
HOSPITAL IT TOO NEARING WHAT

01:50:11.671 --> 01:50:12.305
PULLS DO. ALSO OPERATIONAL

01:50:12.372 --> 01:50:15.308
STANDARDS INCLUDE. THE IN THE

01:50:15.375 --> 01:50:17.243
WATER YEAH THAT'S REQUIRED THAT

01:50:17.310 --> 01:50:18.912
COULD BE DEPENDING ON HOW AND

01:50:18.979 --> 01:50:20.981
WHEN THAT STORAGE IS REQUIRED

01:50:21.047 --> 01:50:22.048
THAT COULD BE AN ISSUE FOR THE

01:50:22.115 --> 01:50:23.883
HOSPITAL. I'M STORING THREE

01:50:23.950 --> 01:50:25.685
DAYS F FUEL COULD COULD CREATE

01:50:25.752 --> 01:50:28.254
SOME CHALLENGES AS WELL SO- I

01:50:28.321 --> 01:50:29.789
DEFERRED UPON THE ON THE-

01:50:29.856 --> 01:50:31.057
NONSTRUCTURAL BUT WE HAVE HEARD

01:50:31.124 --> 01:50:32.258
FROM OUR HOSPITALS THAT STUFF.

01:50:32.325 --> 01:50:33.159
CREATING SIGNIFICANT

01:50:33.226 --> 01:50:35.161
OPERATIONAL ISSUES TO RETROFIT

01:50:35.228 --> 01:50:36.596
TO THAT SPACE AS WELL OKAY.

01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:40.800
THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT.

01:50:40.867 --> 01:50:42.202
THINK THANK YOU THANK YOU

01:50:42.268 --> 01:50:45.939
DOCTOR PAN. JUST A QUESTION.

01:50:46.006 --> 01:50:48.308
HOW OFTEN ARE THIS SITE HOW HOW

01:50:48.375 --> 01:50:50.310
FOR THE SEISMIC STUDIES DONE

01:50:50.377 --> 01:50:52.812
AND HOW OFTEN DOES. IT LOOK AT

01:50:52.879 --> 01:50:54.414
THE RAMIFICATIONS OF THAT

01:50:54.481 --> 01:50:55.115
BECAUSE I'M HEARING ROM A

01:50:55.181 --> 01:50:56.983
HOSPITAL CEO HERE THAT THEY

01:50:57.050 --> 01:50:58.118
WENT OUT AND DID THEIR OWN

01:50:58.184 --> 01:51:00.086
SEISMIC THAT APPEAL TO YOU SO

01:51:00.153 --> 01:51:02.322
THAT DOESN'T. FEEL RIGHT

01:51:02.389 --> 01:51:05.191
SOMEHOW WE'RE RECORD- SO HELLO.

01:51:05.258 --> 01:51:07.560
STAND THAT. TYPICALLY THE

01:51:07.627 --> 01:51:09.696
HOSPITALS WILL DO WILK-

01:51:09.763 --> 01:51:10.597
CONTRACT WITH DESTRUCTION

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:13.099
DURING FIRM. TO DO SEISMIC

01:51:13.166 --> 01:51:15.368
EVALUATIONS ON THEIR SITE. AND

01:51:15.435 --> 01:51:17.904
A MAN INVOLVED YOUR TECHNICAL-

01:51:17.971 --> 01:51:20.006
INVESTIGATIONS AS WELL. WITH

01:51:20.073 --> 01:51:22.375
REGARDS TO SOIL IN SEISMICITY.

01:51:22.442 --> 01:51:23.543
AND THEN THEY WILL SUBMIT THAT

01:51:23.610 --> 01:51:25.178
TO US FOR OUR REVIEW. AND IN

01:51:25.245 --> 01:51:27.781
SOME CASES- THE HOSTELS IN OR

01:51:27.847 --> 01:51:29.983
NEAR MAY COME UP WITH. THE WORK

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:32.318
THAT WE FEEL IS- ABOVE AND

01:51:32.385 --> 01:51:34.521
BEYOND WHAT'S ACTUALLY NEEDED-

01:51:34.587 --> 01:51:36.589
HOWEVER IF THE HOSPITAL AS

01:51:36.656 --> 01:51:38.591
WANTING TO DO THAT MUCH WORK

01:51:38.658 --> 01:51:40.460
THAN THAT IT'S ALLOWED- FOR

01:51:40.527 --> 01:51:51.171
EXAMPLE ON. ON THE. I WON WITH

01:51:51.237 --> 01:51:54.407
BLUE. AND RIVER FOR EXAMPLE I.

01:51:54.474 --> 01:51:55.542
YOU KNOW I'M I'M CURIOUS AS TO

01:51:55.608 --> 01:51:57.210
THE PURPOSE OF THE MICHAEL

01:51:57.277 --> 01:51:59.079
PILES IN A ONE STORY BUILDING

01:51:59.145 --> 01:52:00.447
SO THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WE

01:52:00.513 --> 01:52:02.115
NEED HAS FOR THE DISCUSSION ON

01:52:02.182 --> 01:52:03.917
SO- YEAH WE DO WE DO LOOK AT

01:52:03.983 --> 01:52:05.952
THAT AND WE DO QUESTION IT AND

01:52:06.019 --> 01:52:08.321
SOMETIMES WE WILL. BE ABLE TO

01:52:08.388 --> 01:52:09.222
PROVIDE ALTERNATIVES TO

01:52:09.289 --> 01:52:10.824
HOSPITALS AS TO MAYBE LESS

01:52:10.890 --> 01:52:12.725
EXPENSIVE WAYS TO ACHIEVE

01:52:12.792 --> 01:52:15.228
COMPLIANCE THEN WHAT- THEIR

01:52:15.295 --> 01:52:16.529
INJURES MAY HAVE HAVE COME UP

01:52:16.596 --> 01:52:19.099
WITH SO I GUESS I GUESS WHAT I

01:52:19.165 --> 01:52:19.899
GUESS WHAT I'M STRUGGLING WITH

01:52:19.966 --> 01:52:23.603
THEM IS A LITTLE BIT. IS THAT.

01:52:23.670 --> 01:52:24.237
AND I AND I DON'T WANT TO GET.

01:52:24.304 --> 01:52:25.305
IT YOU KNOW I JUST. THAT IS A

01:52:25.371 --> 01:52:26.906
HOSPITAL PEOPLE YOU PROBABLY.

01:52:26.973 --> 01:52:28.274
ARE PROBABLY A LITTLE.

01:52:28.341 --> 01:52:30.610

01:52:59.172 --> 01:53:02.509
RESOURCES- IF THEY DON'T HAVE

01:53:02.575 --> 01:53:04.377
THE RESOURCES TO BUILD THAT

01:53:04.444 --> 01:53:06.412
WHERE THE RESEARCH COMES FROM

01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:49.689
PICTURE OF. SURVIVABILITY HERE

01:53:49.756 --> 01:53:50.356
I THINK OF THE NATURAL

01:53:50.423 --> 01:53:52.625
DISASTERS IN MY DISTRICT- AND

01:53:52.692 --> 01:53:54.861
THERE HAVE BEEN SEVERAL- MOST

01:53:54.928 --> 01:53:56.729
RECENTLY FIRES AND I THINK OF

01:53:56.796 --> 01:53:58.131
THE PEOPLE THAT WERE EVACUATED.

01:53:58.198 --> 01:54:00.867
AND THE HOSPITAL STAFF AND THE

01:54:00.934 --> 01:54:02.068
AND THE DOCTORS AND EVERY DID

01:54:02.135 --> 01:54:05.271
FABULOUS JOBS MEAN NO NO NO

01:54:05.338 --> 01:54:06.940
REAL BAD OUTCOMES OF ANYTHING

01:54:08.575 --> 01:54:09.409
TALKING ABOUT MAJOR

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:13.413
EVACUATIONS- I WONDER IF AT

SOME POINT. WE HAVE A HOSPICE.

01:54:15.448 --> 01:54:17.016
THAT'S FIVE EIGHT POINT OH

01:54:17.083 --> 01:54:19.352
EARTHQUAKE BUT BECAUSE OF

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:21.988
COMMUNITIES AND- YOU KNOW YOU

01:54:22.055 --> 01:54:23.690
DON'T HAVE A DOCTOR TO GET

01:54:23.756 --> 01:54:25.959
THERE. YOU DON'T HAVE STAFF WHO

01:54:26.025 --> 01:54:27.527
CAN GET THAT IN MANY CASES OUR

01:54:27.594 --> 01:54:31.197
CAN WITH THE FIRES BECAUSE OF

01:54:31.264 --> 01:54:35.034
ELECTRICITY. LACK OF **** IN

01:54:35.101 --> 01:54:36.102
CASES WATER BECAUSE OF RURAL

01:54:36.169 --> 01:54:41.874
RURAL AREAS BIG RELY ON PUMPS-

01:54:41.941 --> 01:54:50.183
THEIR WELLS. WE GO TO WORK AS

01:54:50.250 --> 01:54:52.018
THAT SCHOOL IN SESSION AND SO I

01:54:52.085 --> 01:54:52.852
FOR ME I'M LOOKING FOR THIS

01:54:52.919 --> 01:54:54.153
BALLOT IS SAYS WE ABSOLUTELY

01:54:54.220 --> 01:54:56.122
HOSPO SURVIVE IN A OVER BUT WE

SURVIVE THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE

01:55:00.493 --> 01:55:02.729
CAPACITY TO RUN HOSPITAL

01:55:02.795 --> 01:55:05.565

01:55:06.799 --> 01:55:08.201
ANSWER I'M JUST I'M JUST KIND

01:55:08.268 --> 01:55:09.168
OF KIND OF KIND MAKING A

01:55:09.235 --> 01:55:10.870
STATEMENT THERE- I WOULD

01:55:10.937 --> 01:55:13.439
IMAGINE THAT THE COMMUNITY

01:55:13.506 --> 01:55:15.508
REGIONAL IS A HUGE ECONOMIC

01:55:15.575 --> 01:55:17.610
DRIVER FOR THAT FOR THE FRESNO

01:55:17.677 --> 01:55:21.447
REGION- WHERE HE NOTED THAT

01:55:30.056 --> 01:55:34.427
A RECALL. SEVENTY EIGHT SEC.

01:55:34.494 --> 01:55:38.931
BECAUSE ADDED UP UP BUT I GUESS

01:55:38.998 --> 01:55:39.565
FOR ME A PART OF THIS IS AT THE

01:55:39.632 --> 01:55:41.067

01:55:41.134 --> 01:55:42.268
APPLICATION OF THIS OR IS

CREATE WHAT WE WOULD

01:55:50.677 --> 01:55:52.445
POTENTIALLY LOOK AT AREAS WHERE

01:55:52.512 --> 01:55:53.780
IN A HOSPITAL CEASE TO EXIST

01:55:53.846 --> 01:55:55.782
BECAUSE THERE IS NO ABILITY TO

01:55:55.848 --> 01:55:57.817
FINANCE THEM SO WITH THREE

01:55:57.884 --> 01:56:00.420
EXAMPLES HERE I WONDER HOW MANY

01:56:00.486 --> 01:56:02.155

STRUGGLING HOSPITAL A THAT IS A

02:02:35.314 --> 02:02:38.551

ACTIVITY SHOULD BE DENOUNCED

02:02:39.485 --> 02:02:41.721

02:06:13.365 --> 02:06:15.601
INJURED WHO TRADED WHERE PEOPLE

02:06:15.668 --> 02:06:17.703
IN DISTRESS CAN RECEIVE COMFORT

02:06:17.770 --> 02:06:19.038
AND WHERE THOSE WERE SEPARATED

02:06:19.104 --> 02:06:21.240
FROM EACH OTHER COME TO. WE HAD

02:06:21.307 --> 02:06:24.109
MANY PEOPLE COME IN THE AND

02:06:24.176 --> 02:06:26.011
DONE ONLY HAD PHYSICAL INJURIES

02:06:26.078 --> 02:06:28.647
BUT WERE PURE PANICKED. AND SO

02:06:28.714 --> 02:06:31.450
THAT WAS REALLY IMPORTANT FOR

02:06:31.517 --> 02:06:33.752
IT. BABY STILL NEED TO BE BORN

02:06:33.819 --> 02:06:35.287
THERE'S STILL COMING IN FOR

02:06:35.354 --> 02:06:37.323
LABOR AND DELIVERY STROKES

02:06:37.389 --> 02:06:38.891
HEART ATTACKS BURST APPENDIX

02:06:38.958 --> 02:06:41.393
CONTINUE TO HAPPEN WE STILL HAD

02:06:41.460 --> 02:06:43.662
EMERGENCY SURGERY. YESTERDAY

02:06:43.729 --> 02:06:44.897
BEFORE I LEFT THE HOSPITAL I

02:06:44.964 --> 02:06:46.565
HAD SIX EMERGENCY SURGERIES

02:06:46.632 --> 02:06:48.667
THAT I HAD TO RECOVER. THOSE

02:06:48.734 --> 02:06:49.568
WITH THINGS THAT COULDN'T GO

02:06:49.635 --> 02:06:51.804
AWAY THAT HAD TO BE DONE AND

02:06:51.870 --> 02:06:54.473
THEY WOULD HAVE SHOWN UP IF WE

02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:56.041
HAD AN EARTHQUAKE THAT DAY. A

02:06:56.108 --> 02:06:57.276
GROUP THAT. CRITICAL CARE

02:06:57.343 --> 02:07:00.346
WORKING NEVER PULSE. I HAVE

02:07:00.412 --> 02:07:01.447
FRIENDS WHO WORK AT NORTHRIDGE

02:07:01.513 --> 02:07:03.449
HOSPITAL WHEN THE TRIAGE WAS

02:07:03.515 --> 02:07:05.017
SET UP IN THE PARKING LOT THE

02:07:05.084 --> 02:07:06.218
PATIENTS WERE ALL TAKEN OUT OF

02:07:06.285 --> 02:07:08.020
THE HOSPITAL NORTHRIDGE'S A

02:07:08.087 --> 02:07:11.090
LARGER HOSPITAL IN TARZANA. AND

02:07:11.156 --> 02:07:12.491
THE PATIENTS WERE OUT IN THE

02:07:12.558 --> 02:07:14.526
PARKING LOT FOR IT THIS IS NOT

02:07:14.593 --> 02:07:16.161
WHAT YOU WANT TO DO AND IF YOU

02:07:16.228 --> 02:07:18.163
CAN POSSIBLY AVOID IT YOU DO

02:07:18.230 --> 02:07:19.965
NOT WANT TO ALL OF A SUDDEN

02:07:20.032 --> 02:07:22.134
HAVE TRAUMATIZED PEOPLE OUT IN

02:07:22.201 --> 02:07:24.436
AN AREA WHERE YOU'RE LITERALLY

02:07:24.503 --> 02:07:25.871
GOING YOU'RE GOOD YOU'RE BAD

02:07:25.938 --> 02:07:28.674
YOU'RE GONE. THAT'S IT. LIVES

02:07:28.741 --> 02:07:30.509
ARE LOST WHEN A HOSPITAL CANNOT

02:07:30.576 --> 02:07:33.178
BE FULLY FUNCTIONAL. IT WAS

02:07:33.245 --> 02:07:34.480
THIS EVENT THE MOTIVATED

02:07:34.546 --> 02:07:36.515
CALIFORNIA TO ASSESS THIS

02:07:36.582 --> 02:07:38.150
SAFETY OF ITS COMMUNITIES IN AN

02:07:38.217 --> 02:07:40.386
EMERGENCY REQUIRE THAT MOST AT

02:07:40.452 --> 02:07:42.254
RISK HOSPTALS BE RETROFITTED

02:07:42.321 --> 02:07:44.623
AND UPGRADED TO WITHSTAND THE

02:07:44.690 --> 02:07:48.427
DAMAGE. IT IS A HARD WON WISDOM

02:07:48.494 --> 02:07:50.562
ALLOW BORN A PAINFUL EXPERIENCE

02:07:50.629 --> 02:07:52.798
AND WE CANNOT WE CAN A- SUMMER

02:07:52.865 --> 02:07:55.434
PROPOSAL WE YOU CAN READ TRIPIT

02:07:55.501 --> 02:07:57.002
PART OF A HOSPITAL EXPOSE

02:07:57.069 --> 02:08:00.039
RESTED CATASTROPHES. A COMPLEX

02:08:00.105 --> 02:08:02.307
SYSTEM LIKE A HOSPITAL WORKS IN

02:08:02.374 --> 02:08:04.710
MANY WAYS HOW CAN AN EMERGENCY

02:08:04.777 --> 02:08:05.944
ROOM FUNCTION IF THE SUPPLY

02:08:06.011 --> 02:08:07.312
ROOM IS COLLAPSED IT'S

02:08:07.379 --> 02:08:08.914
IMPOSSIBLE. HOW CAN THE

02:08:08.981 --> 02:08:10.916
RECOVERY ROOM IF YOU CANNOT

02:08:10.983 --> 02:08:13.185
PICK AND CHOOSE WHICH PART IN

02:08:13.252 --> 02:08:15.454
WORK TOGETHER OUR PARTS ALL

02:08:15.521 --> 02:08:17.256
WORK TOGETHER IF I DO NOT HAVE

02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:19.458
THE LAB TO TAKE IN TELL ME WHAT

02:08:19.525 --> 02:08:21.260
THE PATIENT'S HEMOGLOBIN AS I

02:08:21.326 --> 02:08:23.062
DON'T KNOW IF I HAVE TO TRY TO

02:08:23.128 --> 02:08:26.065
GET SOME BLOOD TO GIVE THAT

02:08:26.131 --> 02:08:26.698
PATIENT THAT COMES TO ME IN THE

02:08:26.765 --> 02:08:28.500
RECOVERY. ALL OF THOSE THINGS

02:08:28.567 --> 02:08:31.136
HAVE TO TUNE IN WHEN. SURGERY

02:08:31.203 --> 02:08:32.638
HAS PATIENTS IF AT THE

02:08:32.704 --> 02:08:35.574
EARTHQUAKE TIME. AND THEY WE-

02:08:35.641 --> 02:08:37.142
HAVE THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE FOR

02:08:37.209 --> 02:08:39.011
THE E. R. TO GET THE PATIENT.

02:08:39.078 --> 02:08:40.412
THE PATIENT COMES TO SURGERY

02:08:40.479 --> 02:08:42.848
AND COMES TO US. I GET HIM IN

02:08:42.915 --> 02:08:44.883
RECOVERY ROOM AND I FILL UP TO.

02:08:44.950 --> 02:08:46.218
THE SPACES THAT WE HAVE IN THE

02:08:46.285 --> 02:08:48.787
RECOVERY ROOM YET. THE FLOORS

02:08:48.854 --> 02:08:50.823
ARE NOT CAPABLE OF TAKING THEM.

02:08:50.889 --> 02:08:53.192
THEN EVERYTHING STOPS. WE

02:08:53.258 --> 02:08:55.060
CANNOT TAKE IN ANOTHER PATIENT

02:08:55.127 --> 02:08:57.062
SO THE FLOW OF THOSE STRUCTURES

02:08:57.129 --> 02:08:58.931
WITH IN THE HOSPITAL AND I DO

02:08:58.997 --> 02:09:00.732

BEEN USE NUMEROUS TIMES. IN

02:15:53.311 --> 02:15:54.513
FACT I THINK CHILDREN'S

02:15:54.579 --> 02:15:56.214
HOSPITALS AND SOME OTHERS THEY

02:15:56.281 --> 02:15:58.116
RELEASE SEVERAL BONDS OVER TIME

02:15:58.183 --> 02:15:59.284
I THINK THE NEXT PHASE OF THEIR

02:15:59.351 --> 02:16:01.019
FUNDING IS MOVING SO THAT IS

02:16:01.086 --> 02:16:03.154
DEFINITELY A VIABLE OPTION TO

LOCALS TO. HIM TAX THE LOCALS

02:16:12.898 --> 02:16:14.533
WITHOUT INTERRUPTION WOULD BE

02:16:14.599 --> 02:16:15.500
HELPFUL TO KEEP THESE HOSPITALS

02:16:15.567 --> 02:16:17.736

COMMUNITIES THAT ARE POOR- TAX.

02:16:23.408 --> 02:16:25.143
IT'S HARD TO SQUEEZE MONEY OUT

02:16:25.210 --> 02:16:27.112
OF WHERE THERE IS A MONEY AND

02:16:27.178 --> 02:16:28.480
SO WHEN I START THINKING ABOUT

02:16:28.547 --> 02:16:30.248
SAFETY NET HOSPITALS AND RURAL

02:16:30.315 --> 02:16:31.349

FOR ONE SIZE FITS ALL APPROACH

02:16:58.076 --> 02:17:01.446
IS TO- COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND SO-

02:17:01.513 --> 02:17:03.615
I THAT I THINK WE NEED TO BE

02:17:03.682 --> 02:17:04.382
LOOKING REALLY HOLISTICALLY AND

02:17:04.449 --> 02:17:06.418

THAT WHEN I TO THE HOSPITAL'S

02:17:25.537 --> 02:17:27.505
MY JUST I'VE ONE HOSPITAL THAT

02:17:27.572 --> 02:17:28.940
WAS GOING TO THE SEISMIC YOU

02:17:29.007 --> 02:17:30.375
KNOW UPGRADES AND THEN THEY

02:17:30.442 --> 02:17:32.110
HAVE DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLANS

02:17:32.177 --> 02:17:35.213
AND IT ENDED UP THEY DID A BOND

02:17:35.280 --> 02:17:36.548
AND BUILT A BRAND NEW HOSPITAL

02:17:36.615 --> 02:17:40.485
RATHER THAN TRY. DO WITH OLD

02:17:40.552 --> 02:17:42.253
TOWER AND EVERYTHING ELSE THAT

02:17:42.320 --> 02:17:44.923
THEY HAD- SO WE'RE STILL

02:17:44.990 --> 02:17:47.092
WORKING ON THAT. WHAT'S GOING

02:17:47.158 --> 02:17:48.760
TO HAPPEN WITH THE OLD FACILITY

02:17:48.827 --> 02:17:50.762
BUT I HAVE ANOTHER HOSPITAL

02:17:50.829 --> 02:17:53.865
THAT IS NEW. THAT ACTUALLY WHEN

02:17:53.932 --> 02:17:56.234
WE TOURED IT- THEY HAVE

02:17:56.301 --> 02:17:57.402
DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE HOSPITAL

02:17:57.469 --> 02:17:58.837
THAT THE KIND OF SWITCH OFF AND

02:17:58.903 --> 02:18:01.840
USE IN A DIFFERENT WAY. SO WHEN

02:18:01.906 --> 02:18:04.576
YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT. MAYBE

02:18:04.643 --> 02:18:06.578
PRIORITIZING CERTAIN AREAS TO

02:18:06.645 --> 02:18:09.214
BE YOU KNOW SEISMICALLY

02:18:09.280 --> 02:18:11.116
RETROFIT IN LEAVING THE OTHERS.

02:18:11.182 --> 02:18:12.550
IN A WAITING THEM YOU KNOW

02:18:12.617 --> 02:18:14.686
WHEN- YOU MENTIONED ABOUT THE

02:18:14.753 --> 02:18:16.988
SUPPLY ROOM THAT'S A THOUGHT

02:18:17.055 --> 02:18:18.757
PROVOKING THING BECAUSE IT MADE

02:18:18.823 --> 02:18:20.091
ME THINK ABOUT THE FACT THAT

02:18:20.158 --> 02:18:22.694
THIS ONE THE HOSPITAL. USES

02:18:22.761 --> 02:18:27.032
THIS AREA FOR- A RECOVERY ROOM

02:18:27.098 --> 02:18:30.335
SOMETIMES AND AS YOU KNOW SOME

02:18:30.402 --> 02:18:32.303
TYPES OF OTHER SERVICE I CAN'T

02:18:32.370 --> 02:18:33.438
REMEMBER EXACTLY ALL THE

02:18:33.505 --> 02:18:35.740
DIFFERENT THINGS- OTHER TIMES

02:18:35.807 --> 02:18:38.943
SO. IT'S NOT LIKE A ONE SIZE

02:18:39.010 --> 02:18:40.979
FITS ALL AND I DON'T KNOW HOW

02:18:41.046 --> 02:18:42.881
YOU COULD ISOLATED TO CERTAIN

02:18:42.947 --> 02:18:45.450
AREAS THAT NEED TO BE. YOU KNOW

02:18:45.517 --> 02:18:48.486
THE RETRO FITTED VERSUS OTHERS.

02:18:48.553 --> 02:18:50.055
AND I DON'T KNOW IF YOU SEE

02:18:50.121 --> 02:18:52.190
THAT ANOTHER BUT THAT THE-

02:18:52.257 --> 02:18:53.525
THOUGHT OF THE SUPPLY ROOM

02:18:53.591 --> 02:18:54.926
BEING THAT WOULD PROBABLY BE

02:18:54.993 --> 02:18:56.995
SOMETHING THAT WOULDN'T BE

02:18:57.062 --> 02:18:57.595
PRIORITIZED GENERALLY I DON'T

02:18:57.662 --> 02:19:00.532
KNOW. WE'VE DONE THAT AT OUR

02:19:00.598 --> 02:19:03.601
FACILITY WHERE. DURING THE DAY

02:19:03.668 --> 02:19:05.770
THE CATH LAB THE- CARDIO

02:19:05.837 --> 02:19:07.872
VASCULAR LAB HAS THE RECOVERY

02:19:07.939 --> 02:19:10.275
AREA AND THEN AT NIGHT THEY OF

02:19:10.341 --> 02:19:12.110
CONVERTED THAT OVER TO AN

02:19:12.177 --> 02:19:15.180
URGENT CARE AREAS SO THAT THEY

02:19:15.246 --> 02:19:15.680
TOOK PRESSURE OFF OF THE

02:19:15.747 --> 02:19:18.783
EMERGENCY ROOM. YEAH THAT'S

02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:20.351
WHAT I THINK THE IS THE ONE

02:19:20.418 --> 02:19:22.420
AREAS A TRIAGE OR- THE OVER

02:19:22.487 --> 02:19:23.722
FLOW FROM THE EMERGENCY ROOM

02:19:23.788 --> 02:19:25.623
SOMETIMES AND AS WE COVER ROOM

02:19:25.690 --> 02:19:27.659
OTHER TIMES. SO THAT AREA MIGHT

02:19:27.726 --> 02:19:30.795
BE NOT NECESSARILY PRIORITIZED

02:19:30.862 --> 02:19:32.831
IF YOU LOOK AT IT IN ONE USE

02:19:32.897 --> 02:19:38.036
THE COULD BE IN ANOTHER. SOME.

02:19:38.103 --> 02:19:41.606
NINE THANK YOU- AND I ALSO

02:19:41.673 --> 02:19:43.808

PLAYS IN THE COMMUNITY. DURING

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:55.320
A DISASTER BEYOND WHAT THE

02:19:55.386 --> 02:19:56.821

WHATEVER ELSE AND- AND I THINK

02:20:28.953 --> 02:20:29.487
YEAH I APPRECIATE YOU SHARING

02:20:29.554 --> 02:20:31.089
YOUR STORIES. ABOUT WHAT

02:20:31.156 --> 02:20:32.757
HAPPENED IN NORTHRIDGE WE ALSO

02:20:32.824 --> 02:20:33.658
HEARD FROM THE OTHER HOSPITALS

02:20:33.725 --> 02:20:35.160
THE MAN'S PEOPLE COME TO THE

02:20:35.226 --> 02:20:36.694
HOSPITAL RIGHT THEY MAY COME TO

02:20:36.761 --> 02:20:37.595
THE HOSPITAL BECAUSE THEY ARE

02:20:37.662 --> 02:20:38.763
INJURED OR SOMEONE- FAMILIES

02:20:38.830 --> 02:20:39.864
INJURED BUT THEY MAY BE COMING

02:20:39.931 --> 02:20:41.299
THE HOSPITAL JUST FOR NEWS

02:20:41.366 --> 02:20:43.635
WHAT'S GOING ON. RIGHT IT'S-

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:45.703
IT'S A IT'S CONVENIENT PLACE

02:20:45.770 --> 02:20:47.872
FOR PEOPLE AS WELL AND IT'S NOT

02:20:47.939 --> 02:20:50.008
JUST FOR PEOPLE WHO MAY BE

02:20:50.074 --> 02:20:52.343
RESIGNING NEIGHBORHOOD IT'S US.

02:20:52.410 --> 02:20:53.945
ALSO THAT FOR THE FOR SPONSORS

02:20:54.012 --> 02:20:55.747
COME RAZOR PEOPLE TO ADDRESS

02:20:55.814 --> 02:20:58.449
HELP I THINK THERE'S A VERY

02:20:58.516 --> 02:20:59.517
IMPORTANT ROLE FOR THE HOSPITAL

02:20:59.584 --> 02:21:02.120
TO BE ABLE TO ACT IN THAT

02:21:02.187 --> 02:21:03.855
FUNCTION WE CAN HAVE A DEBATE

02:21:03.922 --> 02:21:06.424
WHETHER YOU KNOW HOW. THE

02:21:06.491 --> 02:21:07.292
HOSPITAL SHOULD BE THE CENTER

02:21:07.358 --> 02:21:08.893
FOR THAT- EVER IS IT'S A CITY

02:21:08.960 --> 02:21:10.929
HALL OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT BUT

02:21:10.995 --> 02:21:13.665
I THINK WITH THIS WAY. RIGHT

02:21:13.731 --> 02:21:19.470
NOW. PERMIT ME GOOD. THE ROLE

02:21:19.537 --> 02:21:20.705
THAT OUR HOSPITALS DO PLAY. AND

02:21:20.772 --> 02:21:21.639
SHOULD PLAY A THIS ASK. GIVE

02:21:21.706 --> 02:21:23.074
THE- THIS TYPE TO SERVE THERE.

02:21:23.141 --> 02:21:24.576
AND SO WITH THAT I THINK THERE

02:21:24.642 --> 02:21:26.845
IS AN ARGUMENT TO BE MADE THAT-

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:28.746
SOME OF PARTICULAR HOSPITALS OR

02:21:28.813 --> 02:21:30.481
STRUGGLING THAT THERE MAY BE

02:21:30.548 --> 02:21:32.350
SOME NEED FOR PUBLIC SUPPORT

02:21:32.417 --> 02:21:33.518
BECAUSE AFTER ALL THEY'RE

02:21:33.585 --> 02:21:34.919
SERVING A FUNCTION. THAT GOES

02:21:34.986 --> 02:21:37.922
BEYOND SIMPLY. A ORG EMAIL AN

02:21:37.989 --> 02:21:39.224
INSTITUTION THAT'S PROVIDING

02:21:39.290 --> 02:21:41.226
HEALTH CARE RIGHT- DURING AN

02:21:41.292 --> 02:21:43.127
EMERGENCY AND- SO THERE'S THAT

02:21:43.194 --> 02:21:45.029
SORT OF PUBLIC SPHERE OF. OF

02:21:45.096 --> 02:21:47.565
THAT. SAME TIME. I WOULD ALSO

02:21:47.632 --> 02:21:49.234
MAKE NOTE AS I WAS LISTENING

02:21:49.300 --> 02:21:52.437
CAREFULLY TO OUR- FROM OUR

02:21:52.503 --> 02:21:54.439
PERSON FROM OSHKOSH IT IS THAT.

02:21:54.505 --> 02:21:56.174
I THINK WELL WE MIGHT THINK

02:21:56.241 --> 02:21:57.775
ABOUT VARIOUS PUBLIC FINANCING

02:21:57.842 --> 02:21:59.711
OPPORTUNITIES WHETHER IT'S

02:21:59.777 --> 02:22:00.511
BONDS ARE THE TYPES OF THINGS

02:22:00.578 --> 02:22:01.679
TO HELP HOSPITALS THAT

02:22:01.746 --> 02:22:03.147
STRUGGLING. I THINK WE ALSO

02:22:03.214 --> 02:22:07.051
NEED TO RECOGNIZE THAT- THE ANY

02:22:07.118 --> 02:22:10.288
SORT OF PUBLIC FUNDS THAT WE

02:22:10.355 --> 02:22:13.024
USE LET THOR COULD BE ARGUED IT

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:16.227
CIVILLY TO ORDER. SERVICE

02:22:16.294 --> 02:22:21.165
FUNCTION ERIC TO MEET THE.

02:22:21.232 --> 02:22:22.634
THIRTY GOT THE IDEA OF HAVING A

02:22:22.700 --> 02:22:23.968
BILL TO. BUILD SOME LITTLE

02:22:24.035 --> 02:22:25.336
EXTRA ARE SOME NICER PERSON

02:22:25.403 --> 02:22:27.438
LIKE THAT. THAT'S BUT- LET I

02:22:27.505 --> 02:22:28.072
THINK WE ALSO NEED TO KEEP IN

02:22:28.139 --> 02:22:29.440
MY THAT LEAST WE'RE LEVERAGE.

02:22:29.507 --> 02:22:32.176
PUBLIC RESOURCES THE THEY CAN

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:32.877
ARE THAT WITH THEIR OWN FRIED

02:22:32.944 --> 02:22:34.846
FINANCE BUT WE NEED TO THE I

02:22:34.913 --> 02:22:36.781
THINK IN TERMS OF- TRYING TO

02:22:36.848 --> 02:22:38.082
FIGURE OUT EXACTLY HOW MUCH OF

02:22:38.149 --> 02:22:40.251
THE THIRTY TWO HUNDRED FORTY

02:22:40.318 --> 02:22:41.152
THREE BILLION IS REALLY

02:22:41.219 --> 02:22:44.088
DIRECTLY RELATED TO. THE TWENTY

02:22:44.155 --> 02:22:45.523
THIRTY STANDARDS VERSES- OTHER

02:22:45.590 --> 02:22:46.691
THINGS AND I RECOGNIZE WHEN

02:22:46.758 --> 02:22:49.193
YOU'RE BUILDING SOMETHING NEW

02:22:49.260 --> 02:22:49.794
RIGHT THERE'S A LOT OF THINGS

02:22:49.861 --> 02:22:52.563
THAT. UBM MAKES SENSE IT'S

02:22:52.630 --> 02:22:54.732
CHEAPER TO ADD ON TO THAT- BUT

02:22:54.799 --> 02:22:57.001
I THINK WE NEED TO. THAT'S

02:22:57.068 --> 02:22:59.170
SOMETHING WE NEED TO- FIGURE

02:22:59.237 --> 02:23:03.041
OUT AS WELL AND THEN. THEN WHEN

02:23:03.107 --> 02:23:05.176
IT COMES TO- SO EXACTLY HOW

02:23:05.243 --> 02:23:06.811
MUCH THAT WOULD BE YOU KNOW

02:23:06.878 --> 02:23:08.546
WHAT ROLE THAT A PUBLIC

02:23:08.613 --> 02:23:10.882
FINANCING. WOULD WOULD BE

02:23:10.949 --> 02:23:12.483
INVOLVED I THINK IT'S SOMETHING

02:23:12.550 --> 02:23:13.751
THAT WE MGHT WANNA LOOK AT

02:23:13.818 --> 02:23:15.086
AGAIN IS THAT THERE'S

02:23:15.153 --> 02:23:16.321
HOSPITAL'S EARNED DIFFERENT

02:23:16.387 --> 02:23:17.989
RANGES RIGHT SO WE HAVE SOME

02:23:18.056 --> 02:23:19.190
THAT ARE DOING BETTER THAN

02:23:19.257 --> 02:23:20.224
OTHERS BUT I THINK PARTICULAR

02:23:20.291 --> 02:23:22.193
SAFETY NET. HOSPITALS THE OTHER

02:23:22.260 --> 02:23:23.561
PART THAT I ALSO MIGHT WANT TO

02:23:23.628 --> 02:23:24.963
MENTION IS THAT WE TALK ABOUT

02:23:25.029 --> 02:23:26.864
FINANCING AND HOW THE HOSPITAL

02:23:26.931 --> 02:23:28.967
PAYS BACK ANY SORT OF LOAN.

02:23:29.033 --> 02:23:31.602
THAT THEY MAY HAVE- OUR SAFETY

02:23:31.669 --> 02:23:33.671
NET HOSPITALS ARE OFTEN MORE

02:23:33.738 --> 02:23:35.773
DEPENDENT ON. STATE XIN

02:23:35.840 --> 02:23:37.241
REIMBURSEMENT FUNDING HAS THEIR

02:23:37.308 --> 02:23:39.711
FUNDING STREAM LIKE MEDI CAL.

02:23:39.777 --> 02:23:40.778
SO WE MIGHT WANT TO HAVE TO

02:23:40.845 --> 02:23:42.714
LOOK AT. WHAT'S MEDI CAL'S

02:23:42.780 --> 02:23:46.351
ROLE- AND WE DO GET A FEDERAL

02:23:46.417 --> 02:23:47.218
MATCH FOR SOME OF THE MEDICAL

02:23:47.285 --> 02:23:49.821
SPENDING. NOW IS THERE IN TERMS

02:23:49.887 --> 02:23:51.556
OF FROM ENSURING THAT WE

02:23:51.622 --> 02:23:53.157
PROVIDE AN ADEQUATE FINANCING

02:23:53.224 --> 02:23:55.460
STREAM. FROM THE PATIENT CARE

02:23:55.526 --> 02:23:56.661
RECOGNIZES AN ESSENTIAL PART OF

02:23:56.728 --> 02:23:58.363
PATIENT CARE I MEAN WHAT WE ARE

02:23:58.429 --> 02:23:59.464
TRYING TO DO IS TRYING TO

02:23:59.530 --> 02:24:00.832
PROTECT. THE PATIENTS FIRST AND

02:24:00.898 --> 02:24:02.200
THEN THE STAFF FOR TAKING CARE

02:24:02.266 --> 02:24:04.469
OF THEM. DURING A DISASTER AND

02:24:04.535 --> 02:24:07.171
THAT STAFF IS ALSO NEEDED SO WE

02:24:07.238 --> 02:24:08.339
WILL KEEP THOSE PATIENTS SAFE

02:24:08.406 --> 02:24:09.107
AND THAT'S THAT'S ALSO NEED

02:24:09.173 --> 02:24:10.475
TAKE CARE OF OTHER PATIENTS MAY

02:24:10.541 --> 02:24:11.976
BE COMING AND SO WE- NEED

02:24:12.043 --> 02:24:14.779
HOSPITAL. GETTING CAN TAKE

02:24:14.846 --> 02:24:16.080
PEOPLE GETTING INJURED WITHIN

02:24:16.147 --> 02:24:19.917
THE HOSPITAL- AND- OR NOT BE

02:24:19.984 --> 02:24:21.552
ABLE TO DELIVER THE HELP THEY

02:24:21.619 --> 02:24:22.553
NEED BECAUSE OF SLOW. IN IT

02:24:22.620 --> 02:24:23.921
UNABLE TO. RIGHT SO I THINK

02:24:23.988 --> 02:24:25.690
THAT PART OF THE GOAL OF THE

02:24:25.757 --> 02:24:26.691
TWENTY THIRTY STANDARDS SO

02:24:26.758 --> 02:24:29.560
THAT. WE ACTUALLY CAN MAKE USE

02:24:29.627 --> 02:24:30.962
OF ALL THE PROFESSIONAL. SO

02:24:31.029 --> 02:24:32.930
THAT'S AVAIL. ON SITE BE ABLE

02:24:32.997 --> 02:24:35.166
TO CONTINUE DELIVER SERVICES.

02:24:35.233 --> 02:24:38.436
SO IN MY MIND AT LEAST SOME. I

02:24:38.503 --> 02:24:42.206
DON'T I DON'T THINK WE WANT THE

02:24:42.273 --> 02:24:44.042
CONVERSATION SHOULD BE ABOUT.

02:24:44.108 --> 02:24:47.278
GIVE UP ON THE THIRTY STANDARD

02:24:47.345 --> 02:24:52.216
I THINK THE- BEES. THAT THERE.

02:24:52.283 --> 02:24:55.086
AND CAN WE- TO HELP. PLEASE AND

02:24:55.153 --> 02:24:56.921
THE P. WORKED WELL TO GET TO

02:24:56.988 --> 02:24:58.389
THAT. ARE USING YOU KNOW

02:24:58.456 --> 02:25:00.691
PRUDENTLY. FOR SOME A PUBLIC TO

02:25:00.758 --> 02:25:01.793
TRY TO HELP THEM IS TO YOU NEED

02:25:01.859 --> 02:25:03.161
SYSTEM I THINK MANY OF THE

02:25:03.227 --> 02:25:05.029
HOSPITALS AND PARTICULARLY

02:25:05.096 --> 02:25:07.265
RURAL COMMUNITIES OR BEGAN

02:25:07.331 --> 02:25:09.400
OFTENTIMES DEPENDENT ON PUBLIC

02:25:09.467 --> 02:25:12.203
FOR. REIMBURSEMENTS ANYWAY IN

02:25:12.270 --> 02:25:14.472
LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. OF THE

02:25:14.539 --> 02:25:16.107
WORD TIME ON DIFFERENT SIDES

02:25:16.174 --> 02:25:18.142
YEAH AS AS AS ITS STATE AND

02:25:18.209 --> 02:25:19.710
ALSO WHAT COUNTIES AND THEY'LL

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:21.245
PLAYING MULTIPLE ROLES IN TERMS

02:25:21.312 --> 02:25:24.682
OF- HOW THAT HOW THAT WORKS-

02:25:24.749 --> 02:25:26.918
SO- SO I THINK THERE'S A LOT

02:25:26.984 --> 02:25:28.052
OF. YOU KNOW I THINK THIS IS A

02:25:28.119 --> 02:25:29.887
CONVERSATION WE NEED TO

02:25:29.954 --> 02:25:35.593
CONTINUE BUT- I DO WE WANT TO

02:25:35.660 --> 02:25:38.262
CAUTION AND THAT- WE WE'VE

02:25:38.329 --> 02:25:40.098
DECIDED AS A LEGISLATURE WE

02:25:40.164 --> 02:25:41.532
ESTABLISH THESE I MEAN THIS IS

02:25:41.599 --> 02:25:42.900
EXISTING LAW TWENTY THIRTY

02:25:42.967 --> 02:25:44.969
STANDARDS AND I ALSO

02:25:45.036 --> 02:25:46.871
APPRECIATE. HEARING FROM. I WAS

02:25:46.938 --> 02:25:48.139
COMMON FROM AJ BUT THAT WE WANT

02:25:48.206 --> 02:25:50.741
YOU KNOW WE WANNA TRY TO. BIG

02:25:50.808 --> 02:25:54.145
SURE THAT WERE FOCUSING ON- YOU

02:25:54.212 --> 02:25:55.980
KNOW WHAT THE ACTUAL RISK IS

02:25:56.047 --> 02:25:56.614
RIGHT WHEN NOT USING A ONE SIZE

02:25:56.681 --> 02:25:58.916
FITS ALL BUT- ULTIMATELY FOR

02:25:58.983 --> 02:26:00.017
THAT COMMUNITY WE NEED TO BE

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:01.219
SURE TO HOSPITALS ABLE TO

02:26:01.285 --> 02:26:03.121
FUNCTION. THE OTHER THING I

02:26:03.187 --> 02:26:04.288
ALSO PERHAPS THEY CAN ALSO SAY

02:26:04.355 --> 02:26:06.357
AND- AND PERHAPS MAYBE COMING

02:26:06.424 --> 02:26:08.493
ON AND I KNOW YOU MADE SOME

02:26:08.559 --> 02:26:11.362
REMARKS IS THAT. HOW DO WE AS

02:26:11.429 --> 02:26:12.830
FOR HOSPITALS ARE TRYING TO

02:26:12.897 --> 02:26:15.900
ACHIEVE THAT GOAL. WHAT ARE WE

02:26:15.967 --> 02:26:18.035
TRYING TO DO TO TRY TO MINIMIZE

02:26:18.102 --> 02:26:19.904
THE COST OF THEM GETTING THERE

02:26:19.971 --> 02:26:23.274
SO- LITTLE YOU KNOW. TO ASK

02:26:23.341 --> 02:26:25.276
FIGHT A LITTLE BIT LIKE CAN WE

02:26:25.343 --> 02:26:26.811
YOU KNOW WHAT. I MEAN I WAS

02:26:26.878 --> 02:26:28.613
INVOLVED IN SOME HOSPITAL AYE

02:26:28.679 --> 02:26:29.914
AYE WITH WASN'T DIRECTLY

02:26:29.981 --> 02:26:30.982
INVOLVED BY WITNESS SOME

02:26:31.048 --> 02:26:32.850
HOSPITAL CONSTRUCTION WHEN I

02:26:32.917 --> 02:26:35.953
WAS AT UC DAVIS AND SO WE WANT

02:26:36.020 --> 02:26:36.487
TO BE SURE WE MAINTAIN THE

02:26:36.554 --> 02:26:38.422
HIGHEST SAFETY STANDARDS- BUT-

02:26:38.489 --> 02:26:41.526
CAN WE'D- LIKE. FACILITATE THAT

02:26:41.592 --> 02:26:42.827
NOW I'M NOT TAKING S

02:26:42.894 --> 02:26:44.028
CISIONS AND THINGS THAT OFTEN

02:26:44.095 --> 02:26:45.463
CAN CAUSE DELAYS THAT AND

02:26:45.530 --> 02:26:48.766
INCREASED COSTS- SPECIALLY- IF.

02:26:48.833 --> 02:26:50.768
COME OUT YEAH. AT LEAST ONE OF

02:26:50.835 --> 02:26:52.803
THE PRICE OF THE METALS GATHERS

02:26:52.870 --> 02:26:53.838
YOU KNOW THE VARIOUS PARTS WAS

02:26:53.905 --> 02:26:55.773
GOING UP DAY BY DAY AND YOU'RE

02:26:55.840 --> 02:26:56.541
SITTING THERE WAITING FOR

02:26:56.607 --> 02:26:57.909
DECISION AND NOW IT'S TWO

02:26:57.975 --> 02:26:59.310
MONTHS LATER NOW. IT'S GOT A

02:26:59.377 --> 02:27:00.912
BIT MORE EXPENSIVE TO BUILD IT

02:27:00.978 --> 02:27:01.512
THAN IT WAS BEFORE HIM FOR THE

02:27:01.579 --> 02:27:04.182
SAME DESIGN- MAYBE WE CAN TRY

02:27:04.248 --> 02:27:05.483
TO DO SOMETHING ALONG THOSE

02:27:05.550 --> 02:27:07.018
LINES AS WELL TO TRY TO HELP

02:27:07.084 --> 02:27:09.353
REDUCE. THE COST WHAT TRAIN

02:27:09.420 --> 02:27:12.156
CHIEF THE GOALS SO- I KNOW IT

02:27:12.223 --> 02:27:13.658
KIND OF GAVE MORE OF A SPEECH

02:27:13.724 --> 02:27:15.493
THAT QUESTION BUT- I AM CAN YOU

AND BACK AT THE TIME WE WERE

02:27:54.565 --> 02:27:56.500

02:27:56.567 --> 02:27:58.936
ROUGHLY A HUNDRED MILLION

02:27:59.003 --> 02:28:00.871

RETROFIT THEY'RE TEARING DOWN.

02:28:09.313 --> 02:28:11.115
THE FRONT HALF OF THE HOSPITAL

02:28:11.182 --> 02:28:16.087
THIS WEEK. AND CEDARS SINAI HAD

02:28:16.153 --> 02:28:18.689

4409% OF THAT HOSPITAL TO TAKE

02:28:24.428 --> 02:28:27.031
IN O IT SO THAT DELAY IN THAT

02:28:27.098 --> 02:28:29.200
WHOLE PROCESS IS EXACTLY WHAT

02:28:29.267 --> 02:28:31.769
YOU JUST SAID. THE CONSTRUCTION

02:28:31.836 --> 02:28:34.005
COSTS EVERYTHING THEN IT WOULD

02:28:34.071 --> 02:28:35.973
HAVE COST TO REPAIR IT BACK AT

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.844
THAT TIME. WAS HAS TRIPLED. AND

02:28:39.910 --> 02:28:42.146
YET FOR ALL THAT PERIOD OF TIME

02:28:42.213 --> 02:28:43.114
WE'VE BEEN SITTING WITH THE

02:28:43.180 --> 02:28:45.483
HOSPITAL THE DOESN'T DOESN'T

02:28:45.549 --> 02:28:48.052

02:28:48.119 --> 02:28:49.320
HOSPITAL THAT I CAN SHOW YOU

02:28:49.387 --> 02:28:51.389
WHERE THE STAIRCASE WAS

02:28:51.455 --> 02:28:53.291
TWISTED. DURING THE INITIAL

02:28:53.357 --> 02:28:55.793
EARTHQUAKE BUT IT'S STILL THERE

02:28:55.860 --> 02:28:58.596
IS ONE CHANGE. IT SO IT IS

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:00.231
IMPORTANT THAT IT IS DONE IN A

02:29:00.298 --> 02:29:01.866
TIMELY MANNER TO PROTECT OUR

02:29:01.932 --> 02:29:07.738
PATIENTS. YEAH I THINK THE

02:29:07.805 --> 02:29:09.206
SHORT ANSWER WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

02:29:09.273 --> 02:29:10.474
IS YOU KNOW YEAH YOU DELAY

02:29:10.541 --> 02:29:11.575
PROJECTS IT'S GOING TO COST

02:29:11.642 --> 02:29:13.044
MORE LATER WE'VE BEEN SAYING

02:29:13.110 --> 02:29:14.912
THAT FOR YEARS AS WE HAVE THESE

02:29:14.979 --> 02:29:17.181
DEBATES- IT CERTAINLY DOESN'T

02:29:17.248 --> 02:29:19.116
HIM. MAKE THINGS CHEAPER AND

02:29:19.183 --> 02:29:20.251
THEN YOU GET TO A CERTAIN POINT

02:29:20.318 --> 02:29:21.686
WHERE YOU JUST DO JUST A FOR

02:29:21.752 --> 02:29:23.120
JUST A FULL NEW HOSPITAL

02:29:23.187 --> 02:29:24.355
BECAUSE IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER

02:29:24.422 --> 02:29:27.191
THAT WAY THEN TO- RETROFIT THE

02:29:27.258 --> 02:29:29.727
PART- AND I THINK ALSO AND IN

02:29:29.794 --> 02:29:30.661
SOME OF MY COMMENTS I WAS

02:29:30.728 --> 02:29:32.697

OFF FOR SALE FROM HOSPITAL TO

02:29:36.334 --> 02:29:38.302
HOSPITAL I THINK IT KIND OF WHO

02:29:38.369 --> 02:29:39.036
WAS TO LOOK AT THOSE

02:29:39.103 --> 02:29:41.105
TRANSACTIONS TO WE'VE BEEN

THE HOSPITAL THAT HAS RETROFIT

02:29:52.950 --> 02:29:57.722

SOME THAT WILL BE HELPFUL TO US.

02:30:15.306 --> 02:30:16.240
THERE IS ANOTHER THING THAT

02:30:16.307 --> 02:30:17.975
CAME TO MIND BUT- THOSE TYPES

02:30:18.042 --> 02:30:19.343
OF THINGS WOULD BE IT WOULD BE

02:30:19.410 --> 02:30:20.378

PREVIOUS THE THAT WOULD BE

02:30:37.161 --> 02:30:38.396
PERSPECTIVE BUYER HAS TO PONY

02:30:38.462 --> 02:30:40.698
UP A LOT OF CASH TO STAY YES

02:30:40.765 --> 02:30:42.133

APART AND THEN YOU HAVE THAT

02:31:08.292 --> 02:31:09.126

STRUGGLE FOR ME- SOMEONE

02:37:09.787 --> 02:37:10.988
HOSPITALS ARE STRUGGLING-

02:37:11.054 --> 02:37:11.789
