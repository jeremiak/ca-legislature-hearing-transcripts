01:11:31.253 --> 01:11:33.589
INPUT FROM THE POSITION MEMBERS

01:11:33.656 --> 01:11:36.659
ON- WHO ARE ALSO ON THE BOARD

01:11:36.725 --> 01:11:38.894
AND SIT ON THESE PANELS I'D ALSO

01:11:38.961 --> 01:11:41.397
STATE THAT THE BILL TAKES A VERY

01:11:41.463 --> 01:11:42.698
MODEST APPROACH WE THINK TO

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:44.900
CHANGING THE COMPOSITION SIMPLY

01:11:44.967 --> 01:11:46.802
REPLACING ONE PHYSICIAN MEMBER

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:50.072
WITH A PUBLIC MEMBER SO- I DON'T

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:51.573
BELIEVE THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE

01:11:51.640 --> 01:11:52.808
ANY SIGNIFICANT DIMINISHMENT IN

01:11:52.875 --> 01:11:55.310
THE BOYS AN INPUT. THAT POSITION

01:11:55.377 --> 01:11:56.111
MEMBERS WOULD HAVE THERE

01:11:56.178 --> 01:11:58.080
CERTAINLY ARE A ARE AND CONTINUE

01:11:58.147 --> 01:11:59.815
TO BE A VERY IMPORTANT PART OF

01:11:59.882 --> 01:12:03.419
THE BOARDS- THE DECISION MAKING

01:12:03.485 --> 01:12:04.987
AND THEN IN AN ADDITIONALLY I

01:12:05.054 --> 01:12:06.555
LIKE TO POINT OUT THAT THE VAST

01:12:06.622 --> 01:12:09.525
MAJORITY OF THE BOARD CASES ARE

01:12:09.591 --> 01:12:12.761
RESOLVED THROUGH A STIPULATION

01:12:12.828 --> 01:12:14.296
SETTLEMENT. I THAT WAS 80% OF

01:12:14.363 --> 01:12:15.798
OUR CASES WERE RESOLVED AND

01:12:15.864 --> 01:12:17.566
THROUGH A STIPULATED SETTLEMENT

01:12:17.633 --> 01:12:19.635
IN THE FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN

01:12:19.702 --> 01:12:22.237
TWENTY. AND WHEN THAT OCCURS THE

01:12:22.304 --> 01:12:23.839
PHYSICIAN TO ENTER INTO AN

01:12:23.906 --> 01:12:25.240
AGREEMENT WITH THE BOARD THEY

01:12:25.307 --> 01:12:27.376
WAIVE THEIR RIGHT. TO A JUDICIAL

01:12:27.443 --> 01:12:29.378
APPEAL WHICH WOULD OBVIATE ANY

01:12:29.445 --> 01:12:31.413
OF THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

01:12:31.480 --> 01:12:33.849
OPPOSITION'S COMMENTS. AND THEN

01:12:33.916 --> 01:12:35.317
I THINK JUST IN CLOSING I WOULD

01:12:35.384 --> 01:12:37.219
SAY WE'VE NOT SEEN ANY EVIDENCE

01:12:37.286 --> 01:12:38.287
FROM THE OPPOSITION TO

01:12:38.353 --> 01:12:41.557
SUBSTANTIATE- THEIR CLAIM THAT

01:12:41.623 --> 01:12:43.659
THEY WOULD BE. MORE COST

01:12:43.726 --> 01:12:45.594
ASSOCIATED IN THE MANNER THAT

01:12:45.661 --> 01:12:49.231
THEY DESCRIBE- SO- WITH THAT I

01:12:49.298 --> 01:12:50.866
WOULD DISAGREE WITH THOSE

01:12:50.933 --> 01:12:52.501
COMMENTS FROM THE OPPOSITION

01:12:52.568 --> 01:12:54.136
THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH

01:12:54.203 --> 01:12:56.171
FOR- FOR ANSWERING THOSE

01:12:56.238 --> 01:12:59.541
QUESTIONS I- I THINK THERE IS A

01:12:59.608 --> 01:13:00.843
DIFFERENCE WHEN YOU ARE JUDGED

01:13:00.909 --> 01:13:03.178
BY MAJORITY OF YOUR PEERS- THAT

01:13:03.245 --> 01:13:04.947
YOU'D BE LESS LIKELY TO APPEAL

01:13:05.013 --> 01:13:07.116
THEN IF YOU'RE JUDGED BY PEOPLE

01:13:07.182 --> 01:13:08.584
WHO ARE NOT NECESSARILY IN YOUR

01:13:08.650 --> 01:13:10.619
PROFESSION- WE HAD A ROBUST

01:13:10.686 --> 01:13:12.087
DISCUSS. IN ABOUT THIS AND

01:13:12.154 --> 01:13:14.990
BUSINESS AND PROFESSIONS AND

01:13:15.057 --> 01:13:16.825
THAT OF. THE SHARE OF THE

01:13:16.892 --> 01:13:18.527
MEDICAL BOARD WAS THERE. NOW WE

01:13:18.594 --> 01:13:20.863
WENT THROUGH THE FACT THAT

01:13:20.929 --> 01:13:21.663
SEVENTEEN OF TWENTY OF THE

01:13:21.730 --> 01:13:23.265
CURRENT HEALING ARTS BOARDS HAVE

01:13:23.332 --> 01:13:24.833
LICENSED PROFESSIONALS AS THE

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.469
MAJORITY. THE FACT THAT THE

01:13:27.536 --> 01:13:28.771
BOARD TO DO MORE THAN JUST IF

01:13:28.837 --> 01:13:30.472
THE PLAN- WHICH IS WHY IT'S

01:13:30.539 --> 01:13:31.073
REALLY AN IMPORTANT TO

01:13:31.140 --> 01:13:33.175
UNDERSTAND. THE PROFESSION AND

01:13:33.242 --> 01:13:34.843
ALL OF THE COMPLEXITY THEY ALSO

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.078
OVERSEE APPROVAL OF THE

01:13:36.145 --> 01:13:37.813
UNDERGRADUATE AND GRADUATE

01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:38.814

ARAD ARE CONTINUING MEDICAL

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:45.220
EDUCATION FOR PHYSICIANS AND SO

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:47.122
IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT

01:13:47.189 --> 01:13:48.924
YOU HAVE- PEOPLE ON THE BOARD

01:13:48.991 --> 01:13:51.927
THE MAJORITY THE PEOPLE ON THE

01:13:51.994 --> 01:13:52.594
BOARD THAT ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND.

01:13:52.661 --> 01:13:54.630
BUT I THINK FOR ME WHAT WAS MOST

01:13:54.696 --> 01:13:57.199
CONCERNING- AND YOU KIND OF.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.568
ALLUDED TO IT. TODAY IS THAT

01:13:59.635 --> 01:14:01.970
THIS BILL ISN'T GOING TO. CHANGE

01:14:02.037 --> 01:14:06.775
THE OUTCOME. IT'S NOT GOING TO-

01:14:06.842 --> 01:14:08.343
BECAUSE THERE TO BE ANY ANY

01:14:08.410 --> 01:14:10.245
DIFFERENCE AND WHAT THE PUBLIC

01:14:10.312 --> 01:14:12.915
HAS BEEN REQUESTING- THE FACT

01:14:12.981 --> 01:14:14.316
THAT THIS BILL IS JUST TO KIND

01:14:14.383 --> 01:14:16.084
OF RESTORE PUBLIC TRUST BUT

01:14:16.151 --> 01:14:18.453
YOU'RE STILL GOING TO. YIELD AND

01:14:18.520 --> 01:14:20.088
LISTEN TO AS YOU SAY THE

01:14:20.155 --> 01:14:22.825
EXPERTS- IS CAN IS REALLY

01:14:22.891 --> 01:14:24.927
CONCERNING FOR ME LIKE WE'RE NOT

01:14:24.993 --> 01:14:26.428
IT SEEMS LIKE WE'RE JUST TRYING

01:14:26.495 --> 01:14:27.830
TO PACIFY PEOPLE INSTEAD OF

01:14:27.896 --> 01:14:30.399
ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING. WHEN I

01:14:30.465 --> 01:14:33.068
ASKED THE- THE CHAIR OF THE
