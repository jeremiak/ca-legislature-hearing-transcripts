THANK YOU CHAIR DAN HANNAH REQUIREMENT OF FINANCE AND I WILL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS- FOR EACH OF THESE PANELS FREE- HOWEVER I WOULD LIKE TO QUICKLY START- BY TOUCHING ON THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES MULTI YEAR ROADMAP. THE ROADMAP BETWEEN THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE FOCUSES ON EQUITY AND STUDENT SUCCESS- BUILDING UPON THE SYSTEM'S VISION FOR SUCCESS THE ROAD MAP ESTABLISH A SHARED EXPECTATIONS AND AMBITIOUS GOALS. BESTING AVAILABLE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT RESOURCES FOR THE COLLEGES TO SUPPORT THESE EFFORTS. IN EXPANDING CHANCES OF ITS CAPACITY TO BETTER SUPPORT COLLEGES MEANS GOALS. IN PARTICULAR THE MULTI YEAR ROADMAP FOCUSES ON GOALS RELATED TO INTER SEGMENTAL COLLABORATION FOR TIMELY TRANSFER. REDUCING TIME 2 DEGREES CLOSING EQUITY GAPS AND IMPROVING ALIGNMENT WITH K. TWELVE AND WORKFORCE NEEDS. I NOT TURNED ON ROLAND. THE CONTINUES TO DECLINE ENROLLMENT THE COLLEGE SYSTEM IS A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO THE FACE FUNDING FOR DISTRICTS TO EIGHT ADDRESSING THIS ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND IS INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET FOR ENROLLMENT OUTREACH AND STUDENT RETENTION EFFORTS BUILDING ON A HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION PROVIDED LAST YEAR. THESE FUNDS WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR SIMILAR USES AT THE AFTER MENTIONED FUNDS PROVIDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. FURTHER TO MEET THE DIVERSE LEARNING MENTALITY DEMANDS OF THE STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE BUDGET INCLUDES AN EXPECTATION THAT DISTRICTS PROVIDE AT LEAST 50% IN PERSON EDUCATION. FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE ACADEMIC YEAR PROVIDED THAT APPROACH IS CONSISTENT WITH PUBLIC HEALTH GUIDELINES IN PLACE AT THE TIE. AND STUDENT DEMAND. THIS EXPECTATION IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE STUDENTS WITH EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS TO MEET THEIR NEEDS. AND ENCOURAGE GREATER HOMELESS. WITHOUT HAVING TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE SERVICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- WILL MOVE TO THE LA- GOOD MORNING. LAYARD I'M POLICY HOUSING WITH THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. COUPLE THINGS TO NOTE ON THIS ISSUE THERE'S ACTUALLY A- THERE'S ALSO PROPOSAL BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO PROVIDE ABOUT TWENTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH. NOW MATE MAYBE A BIT SURPRISING TO HEAR- PROPOSAL BY ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES BECAUSE CONSISTENT WITH NATIONWIDE TRENDS FOR TWO YEAR COLLEGES THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT ENROLLMENT DECLINES BETWEEN. TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN TWENTY IN TWO THOUSAND TWENTY TWENTY ONE. BUT BASED ON SOME PRELIMINARY DATA THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE HAS RECEIVED THERE APPEARED TO BE SOME DISTRICTS THAT MAY BE STARTING TO SEE ENROLLMENT GROWTH. IN THE CURRENT YEAR SO THIS COULD MEAN SOME LEVEL OF GROWTH FUNDING IS WARRANTED FOR THE BUDGET YEAR WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE USE UPDATED ROMAN INFORMATION THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS BUSY WORKING ON NOW TO HELP MAKE A DECISION ON ROMAN GROWTH FOR THE- FOR THE SPRING. NOW THE PROPOSAL FOR A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME FOR RETENTION AND ROMAN STRATEGIES. THAT ONE MIGHT BE A LITTLE TRICKIER FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO LIST TO ADDRESS AS AN APARTMENT OF FINANCE MENTIONED THE- TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET PROVIDED A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SAME PURPOSE. NOW COLLEGES WERE NOT REQUIRED TO REPORT ON HOW MUCH THEY HAVE LEFT OF THAT MONEY.OR WHETHER THE FUNDS THEY SPENT TO DATE HAVE SHOWN. SUCCESS IN IN BRINGING BACK STUDENTS ARE BRINGING BACK MORE STUDENTS THAN OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ENROLLED IN THE COLLEGE'S SO IT'S GONNA BE HARDER FOR THE LEGISLATURE. TO ASSESS WHETHER ANOTHER ROUND OF FUNDING FOR THAT PURPOSE IS- PROMISING OR NOT- IN ADDITION THERE ARE% SURVEYS AND RESEARCHES SUGGEST THE MAJOR REASONS WHY. ADULTS ARE NOT COMING TO THE COLLEGES RIGHT NOW AS WE NEED TO WORK ON A FULL TIME BASIS GIVEN THEIR FINANCIAL SITUATION OR NEED TO CARE FOR OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS DURING THIS TIME. SO IF THAT'S THE CASE IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER ADDITIONAL MONEY FOR ADVERTISING OR PHONE BANKS ARE EITHER OUT OF REACH OUR WILL BE AFFECTED BUT THE LEGISLATURE COULD PROVIDE THE MONEY. ANOTHER OPTION IS TO PROVIDE THE MONEY TO GET IT- MAKE IT MORE FLEXIBLE SO THAT COLLEGES MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE IT FOR OUR RECRUITMENT NOT REACH BUT ALSO USE IT FOR OTHER PURPOSES SUCH AS- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FOR STUDENTS. OR TO HELP WITH COVERED MITIGATION- SERVICES ARE SCREENING AND TESTING AND CLEAN AND THAT SORT OF THING SO ANOTHER OPTION IS TO SERVE AND MAYBE HAVE A COVERT TYPE BLOCK GRANT. THAT COULD BE USED FOR MORE THAN JUST OUR. REGION ENROLLMENT PURPOSES. TRACKING MY- TO HALF AGAIN QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I'LL MOVE ON TO THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. MORNING CENTER LAYERED IN MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MANY MISSILES THAT NEVER AT SECULAR SCENES ARE INSTITUTIONAL SUPPORT AND SUCCESS THAT THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE WE ARE PROUD OF TODAY'S COLLEGE POPULATION IT LOOKS LIKE AN REPRESENTS CALIFORNIA IN FACT STUDENTS OF COLOR. AND MORE THAN THE LAST YEAR THE CALIFORNIA ME COLLEGE IS A PLACE GREATER FOCUS ON OUTREACH TO POSTER NATIONAL STUDENTS THIS FALL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE VISITED EIGHT COLLEGES TO LISTENING HERE DIRECTLY FROM STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR NEEDS. INSTANCE REITERATED THEIR NEED TO BALANCESCHOOL AND WORK OVER 60% OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS WORK I SOLD PROVIDERS OR FOR NECESSITY THEY REITERATED THAT MANY OF THEM HAVE DEPENDENT CHILDREN OR GENERATION STUDENTS AND OLDER. THESE POPULATIONS ACROSS A RANGE OF ENGINE INDICATORS ARE EXPERIENCING A FAR GREATER HEALTH AND ECONOMIC IMPACTS AROUND THE PANDEMIC AND THE BEACH CHOOSING IN CLAIMING THIS PART OF THE GREAT RENEGOTIATION PHENOMENA. TO BETTER UNDERSTAND WHAT IS HAPPENING TO OUR STUDENTS WE CONTINUE TO COLLECT INFORMATION ON CURRENT INSTEON CURRENT ENROLLMENT AND STUDENT BARRIERS TO ENROLLMENT AND PERSISTENCE I WE WILL BE SUPPORTING VARIOUS A MOMENT SURVEYS. NATIONAL WORK IT'LL ALSO COLLECT QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE DATA INCLUDING FOCUS GROUPS ADDITIONAL WORK LIES AHEAD IN BRINGING AND STUDENTS THAT MAY HAVE STOPPED OUT DURING THE CAN DOWN MAKE OR- HAVE BARRIERS TO ROLLING A GREATER INTENSITY. COLLEGES HAVE RESPONDED WITH MANY STRATEGIES WHICH ARE HIGHLIGHTED- IN YOUR- COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WE THINK- AND DATED THE STAFF FOR INCLUDING THAT IN THERE. THE CHANCES OFFICE WILL HAVE A MORE COMPLETE PICTURE ON ENROLLMENT WHEN REMAINING DISTRICTS TO MAKE THEIR DATA WILL BE HAPPY TO PROVIDE UPDATES TO MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE. THE PROPOSAL HUNDRED FIFTY A MILLION WILL BE ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE TO STRATEGY ANTICIPATE NEED. GROW THREE. AS WE SHARED BY L. A. L. NEED YOU KNOW SOME COLLEGES DISTRICT HAVE FUND GROWTH. WE ALL. BELIEVE THAT THERE PROPOSED ROADMAP FOR CALIFORNIA WE COLLEGES THAT'S A BOLD STRATEGY AND THE VISION FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND HIGHER EDUCATION. YOU'LL NOTICE THAT THIS FRAMEWORK BUILDS UPON THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS VISION FOR SUCCESS RATES GREATER ATTENTION AROUND DATA SHARING AND CROSS SYSTEM COLLABORATION WHICH IS CRITICAL DURING THIS TIME. SO WE ARE GLAD TO SUPPORT THIS AND- APPRECIATE ITS ALIGNMENT. AND REEVE RE FOCUS ON THE VISION FOR SUCCESS CORRECT IT'S COMPLEX THAT CRITICAL IN WE HOWEVER MANY ASPECTS STATE LEADERS REMAIN STATE STEADFASTNESS PARTNERS SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE MOMENTUM. THANK. YOU AND HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. END THE WAY OUR AGENDA HAS BEEN STRUCTURED. ISSUE ONE BLEEDS INTO ISSUE TOO WHICH BLEEDS INTO ISSUE THREE AND SO EVEN THOUGH IN A FEW MINUTES WE'LL GET TO ISSUE TWO AND THREE. I WANT TO ASK SOME OVERVIEW QUESTIONS THAT MAY WELL BE THINGS THAT YOU TOUCH ON A LITTLE MORE IN THE NEXT ITEMS BUT I THINK THEY ALL FIT TOGETHER AND WE SHOULD TALK ABOUT THEM IS ONE. AND THE FIRST ONE AND MAYBE. IT SHOULD START WITH THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- THE NEW REFERENCE THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND WE HAVE IN OUR GENDER PACKET THE DIFFERENT GOALS THAT WERE PART OF THAT AND- PERCENT STEP WERE REACHED AGAINST THE GOALS AND SOME WERE GOOD SOME DIDN'T QUITE GET THERE. AND IT IS UNCLEAR IN SOME WAYS WHAT THE EFFECT OF THE PANDEMIC IS WHERE OTHERWISE THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN PROGRESS TOWARD THE GOALS. AND SO ARE YOU JUST A AN OVERVIEW QUESTION IS THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IN YOUR MIND SORT OF COMPLETED AS A PROGRAM AND ARE YOU MOVING ON. TO THE ROAD MAP IS THAT THE WAY WE SHOULD LOOK AT THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR LAYERED- INJURE OUR WORK WE CONTINUE TO ALIGN OUR EFFORTS AROUND THE VISION FOR SUCCESS AND YOU SEE THE ROADMAP IS COMPLEMENTARY WHAT THE ROAD MAP PROVIDES IS ADDED MOMENTUM TO THE WORK- THAT IS INDICATED IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. EVERY MADE THE CHANGES OFFICE PROVIDES A STATE OF THE SYSTEM REPORT WHERE WE SHARE WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AND PARTNERS WHERE WE ARE IN RESPECT TO THAT THE FIRST TIME THAT AS A SYSTEM WE'VE BEEN DOCUMENTING AND TRACKING. OUR WORKER GOALS ANY GAINS WE THINK THAT THIS IS- CONTINUES TO BE IMPORTANT ALSO NOTE THAT COLLEGES UNDER ASSEMBLY BILL EIGHTEEN OH NINE WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT ALSO HAVE LOCAL VISION GOALS THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. SO WE DO THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO. KEEP THIS FOCUSED AS IT ALIGNS EFFORTS AROUND COMPLETION. TIME 2 DEGREES UNITED TEAM AND ALL THINGS THAT ARE OFTEN HIGHLIGHTED THE MAP BY-MEMBERS OF THE LEGISLATURE AS PRIORITIES THEN LET ME. STICK WITH THAT FOR A MINUTE. BECAUSE I'M GATHERING A RATHER. QUESTION SO- GAP. THAT YOU WILL TAKE THE GOALS THAT ARE IN THE VISION SUCCESS KEEP THEM AS GOALS AND STILL MEASURE AGAINST THEM EVEN THOUGH IT WAS ORIGINALLY STE ESTABLISHED AS A FIVE YEAR TIME HORIZON IS THAT CORRECT. CORRECT WE SOMETHING TO THE RIGHT DIRECTION TO BE MOVING IN THE RIGHT FOCUS AREAS AND ON A PERCENTAGE THAT YOU HAVE. ACHIEVED IN THE FIVE YEARS. HOW DID THOSE ALIGNED WITH WHAT YOU'RE GOAL WAS FOR ACHIEVEMENT IN THOSE PERCENTAGES IN THOSE FIVE YEARS. WE'VE SEEN SOME- STALL- AS A RESULT OF THE PANDEMIC AND SOME OF THE COMPLICATIONS OF THE LAST FEW YEARS BUT WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT COLLEGES HAVE TO KNOW THE COLLEGES HAVE MADE-TREMENDOUS GAINS PARTICULARLY IN AREAS AROUND- UNITS UNITED TEAM MEANT AND THE INTENSITY OF ENROLLMENT. OKAY AND THEN LET'S MOVE TO THE ROAD MAP BUT- I HAVE A COPY BUT IT IT WASN'T IN OUR AGENDA PACKET N. R. SHOULD MAKE- MAYBE I SHOULD ASK THIS IS A FORM OF A QUESTION FIRST BUT I THINK IT'S JUST A CLARIFICATION FOR OUR LISTENING AUDIENCE- WE'VE ALREADY HAD OUR HEARINGS ON UC AND CSU. AND IN EACH OF THOSE THERE WAS A COMPACT AND GROWTH WAS CONTINGENT ON THE COMPACT. AND- AND THEY WERE DISTINCTLY TIED TOGETHER. THIS IS DIFFERENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FUNDED BY PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT AND IT'S NOT THE GENERAL FUND AND A DIRECT APPROPRIATION THE WAY IT IS WITH UC AND CSU. SO IS THE- AND MAYBE FINANCE CAN START ON THIS IT IS THE IDEA HERE THAT THIS IS A ROAD MAP RATHER THAN A COMPACT BECAUSE WE HAVE PROP NINETY EIGHT AND- THEN A DECENTRALIZED SYSTEM AND- THAT THE MONEY THAT IS FUNDED FOR GROWTH HAS TO COME FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT SO IT'S A ROAD MAP. AND THEN WITH AVAILABLE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS IS THAT CORRECT. I I'D SAY YES DINNER FROM THE FINANCE THAT YES I'D SAY THAT'S LARGELY CORRECTED THAT- THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE FUNDED UNDERNEATH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AND SO WE HAVE TO WORK WITHIN THOSE AVAILABLE RESOURCES WHEN CONSIDERING- ONGOING FUNDING TOWARDS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THERE IS THE- STATUTORY COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT THAT IT'S GONNA PLIED. TO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA- SO THERE IS SOME EXPECTATION OF CONTINUED ONGOING FUNDING. AND THEN- LET ME ASK AND MAYBE THEIR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM AND THEN FINANCE OR DALY- CAN CHIME IN IF THEY WANT. UP ON THE ROAD MAP. FROM THE A THE REPRESENTATIVE COMMUNITY COLLEGES SAYS IT'S COMPLIMENTARY TO THE VISION FOR SUCCESS SO WHERE'S THE OVERLAP AND WIRES NOT THE OVERLAP WHERE DOES THE ROAD MAP GO FURTHER THAN WHAT IS. IN THE GOALS FOR THE VISION OF SIX FOR SUCCESS. HAVE YOU TO ADDRESS THAT FIRST SENATOR LAYERED ONE ALL CALL ATTENTION TO IS AROUND THE GOAL FOR SUCCESS HAS GOAL OF A 20% INCREASE BY TWENTY TWENTY TO. THEIR VISION AND THE ROADMAP CALLS FOR A SIMILAR GOAL WITH AN EXTENDED TIMELINE WE THINK THAT IT'S STILL IMPORTANT TO CONTINUE TOWARDS THAT GOAL- AND THEN ADDED TIMELINE RECOGNIZES THE COMPLEXITIES STUDENTS IN COLLEGES HAVE FACED OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. AND THEN MAYBE. I SHOULD FIND. SO DO YOU BELIEVE THAT- PROGRESS ON TH ROADMAP IS SOMETHING THAT IS CONTINGENT ON FUTURE RECOMMENDATIONS WITH REGARD TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN THE BUDGET. AND AS NOTED MY COLLEAGUE AT THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- WE REALLY DO VIEW THE DIMINISH A RELIGIOUS VIEW OF THE ROAD MAP IS BEING COMPLIMENTARY AND BUILDING ON THE VISION FOR SUCCESS- I THINK IN IN LARGE PART THE ADMINISTRATION FEELS THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE MOVING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION. WITH THE VISION FOR SUCCESS IN THIS IS REALLY DESIGNED TO SORT OF BUILD ON THAT PROGRESS AND SO I THINK THERE THERE ARE- DIFFERENT DIRECTIONS SUCH AS THINGS LIKE CONCOURSE NUMBERING IN AND- THAT THE COMMISSION WANTS TO CONTINUE PUSHING ON ONE HERE. LET ME INTERRUPT FOR SECOND AND THE ALEJO'S IN LINE BUT LET ME FINISH THIS LINE OF QUESTIONING. WHAT I'M TRYING TO UNDERSTAND IS THE UC AND CSU. COMPAQ'S MAKE. CAN GROWTH FUND. CONTINGENT ON MEETING. A WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THOSE CONTACTS AND I AM TRYING TO STE ASK. IF THERE'S A SIMILAR PRINCIPLE AT PLAY HERE. THAT YOU'VE DONE A ROAD MAP YOU'VE LAID OUT THIS VERSION OF WHAT IS A COMPACT FOR THE OTHER TWO. IF THEY DON'T MAKE PROGRESS DOES THAT AFFECT WHAT YOU DO IN THE FUTURE HAVE YOU LINKED TO THE TO THE WAY THEY ARE LINKED IN UC AND CSU. REST OF MY- OF MY BODY'S AYE I WOULD NOTE THAT THE- AGAIN AS AS YOU PREVIOUSLY REFERENCED THE COMMUNICATORS ARE FUNDED UNDERNEATH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE SO THERE IS THAT- LEVEL OF EXPECTED FUNDING- INCLUDED WITHIN THE CONTACT IS THIS SORT OF- EXPECTATION THAT AS AS- THE COMMUNICORP IS CONTINUE WORKING TOWARD THESE GOALS THE ADMINISTRATION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE. SURE TARGETED INVESTMENTS TO HELP COLLEGES MEET THE VISION FOR SIX FOR THE MULTIROOM APPLES. AND THE ADMINISTRATION IS ALSO PROVIDING ADDITIONAL COMMUNITY COLLEGE- CHANCES OFFICE STATE OPERATIONS SUPPORT. TO HELP THE CHANCES OFFICER IT'S DISTRICTS WITH MANY MUSICALS AND I NOTICED DALY- TOOK HIS HAND DOWN. TO NO LONGER WANT TO MAKE A STATEMENT. NO I DO I JUST TO ASK TO THAT. BURDENS GRILL THAT'S CORRECT THAT YOUR PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT WHICH IS IN THE STATE CONSTITUTION. IS NOT CONTINGENT ON. THE COLLEGE'S MEETING SPECIFIC TARGETS. ALTHOUGH THE LEGISLATURE HAS SOME FLEXIBILITY WITHIN PROP NINETY EIGHT YOU COULD DECIDE TO. MAKE SOME FUNDING LINKED TO CERTAIN OUTCOMES AND THEN ANY MONEY THAT'S NOT EARNED COULD GO TO K. TWELVE OR SOME OTHER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT PURPOSE. THE SECOND THING I JUST WANTED TO MENTION IS THAT. BAD THE GOALS THERE ARE NUMBER OF GOALS IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. THAT THE CALL A DA ROAD MAP SO THERE IS OVERLAP THERE ARE IN SOME CASES THE ROAD MAP GOES BEYOND THE VISIONS FOR SUCCESS FOR EXAMPLE. THERE IS A- CALL IN THE ROAD MAP FOR INTERSEGMENT ALL COLLABORATION. FOR THE COLLEGES TO WORK WITH THE UNIVERSITIES FOR EXAMPLE TO ESTABLISH A COMMON INTEGRATED ADMISSIONS PLATFORM AND THERE ARE THERE ARE A NUMBER OF OTHERS- GOALS THAT ARE IN THE ROAD MAP THERE ARE NOT IN THE VISION FOR SUCCESS. I JUST SO I JUST WANT TO MAKE THAT POINT. CLEAR OKAY. N. APPRECIATE THAT AND- LET ME MAKE THE SAME COMMENT HERE THAT I MADE IN THE UC CSU HEARINGS AND THAT IS. I KNOW THIS IS A LITTLE DIFFERENT BECAUSE WE HAVE PROP NINETY EIGHT EIGHT AND THEIR DIFFERENT THINGS THAT APPROPRIATE FROM THAT IN A WAY THAT. AREN'T AS DISCRETIONARY IS THE GENERAL FUND APPROPRIATION AND CSU AND UC. ARE BROAD THE COMMENT I MADE IN THOSE HEARINGS IS THE GOVERNOR AND THE INSTITUTION MAY HAVE AGREED ABOUT WE HAVE THE CONSTITUTIONAL DUTY TO APPROPRIATE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN AND THERE SHOULDN'T BE AN AUTOMATIC ASSUMPTION. THAT THIS AGREEMENT IS MADE AND COMPLETELY DONE BECAUSE THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO BE INVOLVED AND I THINK WE WILL WANT TO. LOOK AT THIS AGREEMENT OVER TIME. ARE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FULLY UNDERSTAND IT AND WHEN WE COME BACK FOR THE MAY REVISE. UP HA IF WE HAVE ANY CONCERNS WE WILL EXPRESS THEM AT THAT TIME BUT I JUST WANNA. THANK KNOWLEDGE THAT WHILE WE MIGHT NOT HAVE HAD A SEAT AT THE TABLE WITH THE NEGOTIATIONS WE HAVE A SEAT AT THE TABLE SO. JUST SO THE THAT THAT THAT IS UNDERSTOOD AND AN A AYE WHAT THE OTHER BRANCHES NO. DATA IF I READ IN THE NEWSPAPER THAT THEY'RE NOW SAYING IT IS A DONE DEAL WENT AHEAD AND THAT IT'S ALL OVER I WILL HAVE A COMMENT SO- JUST TO MAKE SURE THAT STATEMENT IS MADE. AND THEN. TO GO- THE A COMMUNITY COLLEGE RIGHT. TALK ABOUT- WHEN THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH NUMBERS ARE GOING TO BE AVAILABLE AND- BORN ROMAN NUMBERS AND- I KNOW YOUR DEADLINE FOR THE INDIVIDUAL COLLEGES TO REPORTERS PASSED WHEN DO YOU EXPECT TO HAVE ALL OF THEM REPORT AND YOU HAVE THOSE NUMBERS FOR PUBLIC REVIEW JULIE TO FINALIZE THE NUMBERS BY THE END OF THIS MONTH SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO INFORM. LEGISLATIVE CONVERSATIONS AN EXTERNAL REVIEW. IF WE DON'T HAVE ALL THE DATA FROM ALL DISTRICTS WE WILL NOTE THAT AS EXEMPTIONS- AND CLARIFY THAT WITH MY COMMITTEE CONSULTANCY LA- DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND STATE LEADERS- SIMILAR TO THAT MAN TO HAVE AN EXEMPTION FOR NOT TURNING AND THE DATE. DID YOU JUST OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE A AND THE AUTHORITY TO FORCE DISTRICTS TO SUBMIT THEIR DATA AND SO WE'VE REACHED OUT TO ALL THE DISTRICTS THAT HAVE OUTSTANDING DATA WE'RE HOPING THAT THEY WILL COMPLY- AND THEN. IF WE HAVE ANY LATE WE WILL. I KNOW THAT- WHEN YOU SEE THAT ANALYSIS WHAT DOES WHAT DOES IT CAMPUS AND I'M I RECALL. IN ONE OF OUR OFFLINE CONVERSATIONS THAT AT THAT TIME THERE WERE TWENTY CAMPUSES THAT HADN'T REPORTED DATA OUT OF HOWEVER MANY IT IS OVER A HUNDRED. IS THAT A IS THAT STILL THE NUMBER THAT HAVEN'T REPORTED AT THE MOMENT AND SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT- THROUGH FURTHER OUTREACH WILL BE ABLE TO GET THAT INFORMATION BY THE END OF THIS MONTH AND WHEN YOU SAY THERE COULD BE AN EXEMPTION TO SOMEBODY BENEFIT IN SOME STRANGE WAY BY NOT REPORTING THAT DATA. NOT NOT OUR UNDERSTANDING OF THE BENEFITS- AND SHOCKED- WHEN THEY DON'T SUBMIT THE DATA FROM THE TEAMSTERS OFFICE COULD NOT SUBMIT ON THEIR BEHALF I'VE HAD THE NATIONALDATA REPORTING SITE AS WELL. OKAY L. A. O. AS HIS HAND. THE COMMITTEE MIGHT WANT TO GET CLARIFICATION ON THE CONSEQUENCES OF DISTRICTS NOT REPORTING A MOMENT BECAUSE DISTRICTS REPORT ENROLLMENT TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE CAN DETERMINE HOW MUCH APPORTIONMENT MONEY HOW MUCH GENERAL PURPOSE MONEY THAT DISTRICT IS ENTITLED TO SO IF THE DISTRICTS NOT REPORTING THAT INFORMATION. I'LL LET THE LEGISLATURE COMMITTEE MIGHT TO UNDERSTAND HOW CAN THE GASES OFFICE THEN KNOW HOW MUCH TO GIVE THE DISTRICT IN FUNDING BE WITHHELD WON'T PROBLEM LET ME TELL ME YOU KNOW THAT INFORMATION LET ME JUST GO AHEAD AND PUT THAT QUESTION TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT'S WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ASK IN A MORE. UP MANNER AND I THINK HE WAS JUST CLEAR SO. HOW WOULD YOU RESPOND TO THAT. YOU THINK THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO HAVE- CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE HOLD ON DISTRICTS ACCOUNTABLE TO ENROLLMENT REPORTING ESPECIALLY IN TIMES LIKE THIS HAPPY TO ENGAGE IN CONVERSATIONS OF WHAT THAT COULD LOOK LIKE- THAT ONE NOW THAT WAS AN OP TO CENSOR SAYS SO- GIVEN WHAT THE L. A. O. SAID THAT THERE SHOULD BE CONSEQUENCES. WAS THAT A VERY VAGUE. SUGGESTION THAT THERE MIGHT BE CONSEQUENCES. I MEAN THAT'S THE QUESTION IS SOMEBODY DOESN'T REPORT AND YOU'RE OBLIGATED TO RELEASE MONEY TO THEM. HOW IS THAT CONNECTED. I WANTED PROVIDED CLARIFICATION TO SOMETHING THAT THE L. A. O. SAID- WE HAVE TWO DISTINCT TYPES OF RECORDING ONE THAT IS UTILIZED FOR OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEMS THE OTHER IS THAT THAT IS USED FOR- HEAD COUNT LIKE THE KIND THAT YOU HAVE. IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS ALL REPORTING FOR FINANCIAL ELEMENTS HAS BEEN SUBMITTED WE DO HAVE THOSE WHAT WE WHAT IS UNDER QUESTION RIGHT NOW IS ANY DATA THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHAT SO ARE LOST IN HEAD COUNT- THE MOMENTUM IN WHICH STUDENTS WHAT TYPE OF STUDENTS ARE NOT RETURNING OR STOPPING OUT- ALL OF THAT IS ALSO IMPORTANT. BECAUSE IT HELPS US UNDERSTAND THE PROFILE OF WHO ARE COLLEGES ARE SERVING AND THEIR WORKLOAD. OKAY THAT WASN'T CLEAR FROM YOUR EARLIER ANSWER. AND NOW WE ARE. GET SOMEWHERE. OF THEN LET ME ASK ANOTHER QUESTION- BECAUSE THERE HAS BEEN A SYSTEM AND I CAN'T REMEMBER I HAD IT WRITTEN DOWN I. CAN'T PUT MY HANDS ON IT FOR HOW YOU OF SORT OF HAD A ROLLING THING ON ENROLLMENT DURING THE PANDEMIC OR EQUIVALENT OF A HOLD HARMLESS ON ROMAN HAS A FUNNY NAME YOU WOULDN'T NORMALLY ASSOCIATE WITH THE SUBJECT BUT THAT EXPIRES ON JUNE THIRTIETH AS I UNDERSTAND. WHAT ARE THE PLANS FOR THE YEAR STARTING JULY FIRST ON- ENROLLMENT AND HOW IT'S TIED TO THINGS. SENATOR LAYERED YOU WERE REFERRING TO EMERGENCY CONDITION ALLOWANCES EASIER TITLE AND NOT OUR TITLE- FIVE PROVISIONS. THAT THE CANCER HAS A THIRTY TWO- AND STATE THEY'RE TYPICALLY USED WHEN THERE ARE FIRE EMERGENCIES EARTHQUAKE AND OTHER SUCH DURING THE PANDEMIC MADE THOSE AVAILABLE- FOR DOES IT NEEDED TO PREVENT ANY AMOUNT OF FINANCIAL LOSSES. AS A RESULT OF HEALTH CONCERNS- OUR GOAL- AND URGENCY FOR HAVING FINAL M. I. S. DATA SUBMITTED IS SO THAT WE CAN MAKE THAT ANALYSIS OUR HOPE IS TO HAVE. THAT ANALYSIS AND A DECISION ON EMERGENCY CONDITION ALLOWANCES BY MARCH BUT IF YOU DO NOT DO ANOTHER YEAR OF EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE. IT'S SORT OF KICKS IN THE ENROLLMENT CLIFF FOR WHAT HAS BEEN DECLINING ENROLLMENT TO THE PANDEMIC. OR OTHER THINGS IS THAT CORRECT. WE THE WAY THAT ON A FUNDING IS STRUCTURE AND THEN AND BASS T. START RICHARD UNIT. THEY HAVE A THREE YEAR AVERAGE SO IT'S REALLY A STEP DOWN- THAT THEY EMERGENCY CONDITIONS THAT THEY'VE HAD FOR THE PAST FEW YEARS. TO ROLL INTO THAT THREE YEAR AVERAGE TWO EIGHT IF THEY DO NOT GET EXTENDED WOULD ONLY A FACT ABOUT A THIRD OF THEIR AFTER E. S. AND WE WILL HAVE. COMPLETE ANALYSIS BY NEXT MONTH OF A VERSION OF THAT QUESTION WHICH IS UNDER EVEN THE ROLLING THREE IN MANY WAYS THERE'S A CLIFF AT THE END OF BECAUSE IT'S ROLLING IN THERE BENNETT DROPS- IS THERE SOME EXPECTATION THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE A TIME WHEN THAT OTHER COLLEGES ARE GOING TO BE HIT. WITH A BIG PROBLEM BECAUSE OF FOR A DECLINING IN ROME. COLLEGES THAT DON'T RESTORE BELIEVE THEIR INVOLVEMENT THAT ALSO MEANS THAT THEY'RE SERVING FEWER STUDENTS- AND THEREFORE- EXTENDED PROTECTIONS MEANS THAT WE'RE FINDING- TAXPAYER RESOURCES FOR STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVED. SO THAT THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF- CONVERSATIONS WE WANT TO HAVE WITH THE LEGISLATURE THE ELIAN HELLO. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ON HOW DO WE CONTINUE TO STRUCTURE AND SENTENCED TO SERVE ADDITIONAL STUDENTS- AND SERVE THEM WHILE DURING THIS TIME. AND JUST BEFORE I GO TO THE ALEJO WES IS HAND UP. OF LET ME. SAY THAT WHEN WE HAD OUR K. THROUGH TWELVE. HEARING ON ENROLLMENT. PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. THERE BEEN A WHOLE HARMLESS. AND THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED HOLDING HARMLESS ANOTHER YEAR. AND WHILE ALL THE DISTRICTS- CHEERING ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY'RE HELD HARMLESS THIS YEAR IT MEANS THAT THERE WILL BE A CLIFF AT THE END OF THAT AND THE QUESTION WAS. WHICH IS WHAT I WAS TRYING TO ASK HERE. IS WHETHER WE SHOULD START TO THINK ABOUT ADDRESSING THAT CLIFF NOW I'M- IF THERE'S A HOLD HARMLESS IN A ROLLING THING EVERYBODY WILL LOVE IT AND WE SHOULD DO IT BUT. SHINN'S NOW ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO CUSHION THAT RATHER THAN CHEST. COMING UP ON IT AND HAVE EVERYBODY SAY WHAT NOBODY SAW THIS COMING THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO DRIVE ACT. YEAH I BELIEVE THAT YOU'RE HIGHLIGHTING A REALLY IMPORTANT POINT ONE POINT TWO IS SOMETHING THAT IS IN YOUR COMMITTEE ANALYSIS THAT- IDENTIFIES OF THEIR OPTIONS FOR. CONSIDERING DEALING WITH THIS- RATHER THAN JUST SPENDING ON GROWTH THAT MAY NOT BE THERE AT COLLEGES. RATHER SHIFTING THE CONVERSATION TO THE OVERALL COST OF OPERATIONS OF. EDUCATING STUDENTS THERE ARE FEW OPTIONS SUCH AS- INCREASING RATES UP SUCH AS THE BASIC- ALLOCATION- THAT- CAN BE CONSIDERED A COULD BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION THAT YOU'RE REFERENCING CENTER LAYER. OKAY WHAT THE L. A. O. HAS HIS HAND UP AND BEFORE AFTER HE'S DONE. UNLESS THAT RAISES ANOTHER QUESTION OR COMMENT BEFORE GO TO SENATOR MAN I'M JUST GOING TO ASK IF FINANCES ANY COMMENTS ON THIS WHOLE DISCUSSION SINCE THEY HAVEN'T COMMENTED ON WIRELESS WITH GOING BACK AND FORTH. SO LET ME GO TO THE L. A. L. YOU'RE JUST TO CLARIFY SOMETHING. IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THERE ARE A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE GETTING THEIR FUNDING BASED ON THREE YEARS OF PRE PANDEMIC ENROLLMENTS SO THAT THAT WAS MERGING SEA CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE OF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS APPROVED IS ALLOWING THESE DISTRICTS OR IS IT ABOUT FORTY OF THEM ARE THERE ARE GETTING- FUNDED BASED ON THREE YEARS OF A PRE PANDEMIC NUMBERS. NOW THOSE DISTRICTS OF. STAND TO LOSE ENROLLMENT FUNDING BEGINNING IN TWENTY THREE TWENTY FOUR IF THEY'RE ENROLLMENT DOES NOT REBOUND OVER THE NEXT YEAR SO AND IF THE BOARD OF GOVERNORS DOES NOT EXTEND THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE. FOR ANOTHER YEAR SO THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- THE LEGISLATURE OF COURSE WANT TO LOOK AT- WENT ON- WHETHER IT ANTS DISTRICTS TO BEGIN ADJUSTING THEIR BUDGETS NOW IN RESPONSE TO CURRENT ENROLLMENT CONDITIONS. OR WHETHER YOU KNOW THAT THE LEGISLATURE WANTS TO SIGNAL TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THAT IT WISHES TO SEE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE EXTENDED FOR ANOTHER YEAR BECAUSE YOU'RE RIGHT- CARE LAYERED- YOU DISTRICTS WILL START TO SEE A REDUCTION IN THEIR FUNDING THAT THEY GENERATE THROUGH THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. IF THOSE MOMENTS DON'T COME BACK AND THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE IS NOT EXTENDED THANK YOU THAT'S WHAT I WAS- TRYING TO. TO GET AT AND THE THING ABOUT IT IS THAT I REALLY DON'T WANT TO MAKE CUTS TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES THIS YEAR. AND THEY DON'T WANT BROAD I WANT EVERYBODY TO BE AWARE THAT THIS IS A COMING ISSUE AND IF THERE IS A WAY WE NEED WE NEED TO START TO THINK ABOUT- DEALING WITH THAT. AND I HAVE BEEN RESISTING IN THIS ITEM ASKING ABOUT THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING TO THE ADDED ANOTHER ITEM BUT I REALLY UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S TOTALLY RELATED. TO ALL THIS IS ONE. MORE MASS FINANCE DO YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS THAT THE US TO MAKE ON THIS DISCUSSION. AND- HAPPY COMMENT- I THINK AS AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM CHANCE UPS THERE ARE SEVERAL PROTECTIONS CURRENTLY BUILT INTO THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA NOT TO NOT TO JUMP AHEAD AND YOUR MORNING INSTEAD- SUCH AS THE THREE YEAR ROLLING AVERAGE AND THE HOLD HARMLESS WHICH IS STILL IN PLACE FOR DISTRICTS- AND SORT OF THE ONE YEAR OLD THOMAS FOR DISTRICTS OF THAT THERE ARE VARIOUS PROTECTIONS THAT ARE BUILT IN PLACE FOR DISTRICTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS NOT. SORT OF A STEEP DROP IN FUNDING- WE ALSO THINK IT'S A BIT SPECULATE AT THIS POINT TO PROJECT WHAT FUNDING OR WHAT IN WOMAN IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE WITH SO MANY CHANGING CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE CODE NINETEEN PANDEMIC- AN ANSWER THE SITUATION FACED BY OUR OUR STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS SO I THINK THIS IS SOMETHING THAT WE'RE CONTINUING TO MONITOR AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH. OUR PARTNERS AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE ANY AUDIO AND OF COURSE THE LEGISLATURE- AS WE MOVE FORWARD THANK YOU BECAUSE WE'RE GOING TO WANT TO HAVE THAT CONVERSATION AND- BEFORE GO TO SENATOR. MAN FOR QUESTION LET ME JUST. I. MY HAVE SAID IT. SENATE ROAD CHOI BO GOING. AND TO. ANOTHER HERE. SO IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A QUESTION SHE MIGHT GIVE IT TO YOU LATER. AS SHE IS WORKING HARD AND ANOTHER COMMITTEE SENATOR MEANT. THANK YOU CAN AMERICANS- SO I THINK CHAIR LAYERED COVERED A LOT OF GROUND OBVIOUSLY I DID HAVE A QUESTION AND THEN I COMMENT. MY QUESTION RELATES TO A LOT OF THE- DIALOGUE THAT YOU HAD- JUST NOW. AROUND ENROLLMENT AND THE CAUSES OF IT- YEAH I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET THE NEW ENROLLMENT NUMBERS AT THE END OF THIS MONTH- WE HAD A DISCUSSION WITH CSU WHICH I THINK IS. DIFFERENT BUT HAS SOME SIMILAR ASPECTS TO IT IS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA- IT WAS THE THINGS I FIND INTERESTING ABOUT ENROLLMENT RIGHT NOW IS THAT YOU'VE GOT MULTIPLE POTENTIAL CAUSES OF IT RIGHT- CERTAINLY COBIT NINETEEN BOTH TE HEALTH RELATED ASPECTS. AS WELL AS- THE REMOTE INSTRUCTION ARE PROBABLY FAXING HUGE FACTORS IN DECLINE ENROLLMENT WE'VE SEEN IT SEE ISSUES AND COMMUNITY COLLEGES- AT THE SAME TIME THERE THERE MAY BE OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTING THAT IN AND CERTAINLY- YEAH I ASSUME THIS IS THE SAME FOR THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM CSU'S TOLD ME. IN IN RESPONSE TO A QUESTION I HAD AT THEIR HEARING. THAT WHEN WE HAVE A STRONG ECONOMY WITH HIGH WAGES AND LOTS OF JOBS WHAT WE TEND TO SEE IS- A LOT OF PEOPLE DECLINING TO GO TO COLLEGE- INSTEAD TAKING THAT OPPORTUNITY TO GO TO JOIN THE WORKFORCE FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME- AND GIVEN THE HIGH WAGES WE'RE SEEING NOW I WOULD IMAGINE THAT IS ALSO A CAUSE OF THE DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT- AND THEN THERE'S ALSO THIS POTENTIAL STRUCTURAL FACTORS. HOW DO WE HAVE A CHANGING WORKFORCE TO HAVE CHANGING DEMOGRAPHIC TRENDS. THAT ARE CAUSING FEWER PEOPLE TO MAYBE WANT TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AND SO MY QUESTION IS THIS- MAY MAYBE SMARTLY START AND MAKE THIS A TWO PARTER FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND ALEJO- DO YOU THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL IF WE HAD SOME KIND OF DATA. ON WHY STUDENTS ARE NOT GOING TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR WHY THEY'RE CHOOSING TO GO TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE. AS WE KIND OF COME UP WITH THE NUMBERS. AS WE THINK ABOUT BUDGET ALLOCATIONS NOT JUST THIS YEAR BUT OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. OUR AND IN ROMAN TARGETS. WELL I CAN ANSWER FIRST IF THAT'S HELPFUL- I'D SAY- CENTER TO YOUR QUESTION- AND ALSO TO THE POINT YOU MADE YES. THE CAUSE OF THIS ARE POTENTIALLY. MYRIAD AND THERE ARE DEFINITELY- A LOT OF POTENTIAL REASONS WHY COMMUNITY WIDE ENROLLMENT HAS BEEN DECLINING. OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS. I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT WE ARE SEEING THESE ENROLLMENT TRENDS NATIONWIDE SO THIS IS NOT SOMETHING. AS WELL THAT SPECIFIC TO CALIFORNIA OR TO OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM BUT- IS ALREADY SOMETHING ARCING ACROSS THE SYSTEM- I THINK I THINK OF COURSE IT IS. IS ABSOLUTELY HELPFUL IN HELPING US TO TAKE CONSIDERED POTENTIAL DECISIONS AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO. HAVE CONVERSATIONS- AS WE AS WE MOVE TOWARDS THE MAYOR VISION AND INTO THE NEXT TWO BUDGET YEARS. I'M RELATED TO ENROLLMENT AND WHAT. OUR STUDENTS ARE. HANDLING THIS BUT- YEAH AND AGAIN IT IT. OUR EXPECTATION IS THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE PRETTY- DIFFERENT REASONS FOR VERY DIVERSE STUDENT POPULATION SURE BUT BUT NOT UNDERSTANDING THOSE REASONS I GUESS WOULD BE. VERY HELPFUL IN DETERMINING WHAT ENROLLMENT TARGETS BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW WHAT. THAT THERE SOME OF THESE- pBE MORE PERMANENT STRUCTURAL I GUESS THAT THAT'S A REALLY WHAT I'M GETTING AT. I L. A- DO YOU HAVE ANY THOUGHTS HERE. YEAH WE WOULD AGREE- HAVING BETTER IN. ABOUT THE REASONS WOULD BE- USEFUL FOR THE LEGISLATURE OF THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS DONE SOME WORK IN THIS AREA YEAH IN THE FALL THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE- SURVEYED ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED. RESPECTIVE STUDENTS OR ADULTS WHO OTHERWISE MIGHT HAVE GONE TO COLLEGE AND WHAT THEY HEARD BACK WAS THAT THEY NEED TO WORK FULL TIME WAS SEEN AS IS ONE OF THE MAJOR BARRIER THE MAJOR BARRIER FOR ENROLLING IN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES AS YOU MENTIONED SENATOR MAN. AS A AS A POSSIBILITY SO THAT'S- THAT'S SOMETHING THAT- SOME DATA POINT THAT THAT WE HAVE YEAH AND ALSO- STUDENTS ARE PROSPECTIVE STUDENTS THAT HAVE FAMILY OBLIGATIONS THEY NEED TO STAY IN WITH A CHANCE CAL CARES BECOME DIFFICULT THERE'S OTHER ISSUES SO THAT'S ABSOLUTELY- TRUE BUT HAVING HAVING EVEN MORE INFORMATION BETTER INFORMATION OR DISTRICT LEVEL INFORMATION WHICH WOULD ACTUALLY BE MORE USEFUL THAN THAN WHAT WE HAVE NOW. AND OF COURSE HERE MA'AM IS NEVER AND I WANT TO GO TO YOU AND ASK THAT YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU CAN ELABORATE ON THE SURVEY THAT MR SEEN HOUSING WAS REFERRING TO AND DO YOU HAVE PLANS TO TRY TO DIG DEEPER BECAUSE TO ME THIS. YEAH YOU KNOW BEFORE WE YOU KNOW DECIDE WHAT WE'RE BASICALLY SHOOTING BLIND HERE AND IF WE HAVE MORE DATA I SUSPECT I'LL BE INCREDIBLY HELPFUL AS WE DETERMINE WHAT'S APPROPRIATE YOU KNOW MAYBE WE WILL SEE AN IRONIC LAUGH MAYBE THAT'S JUST ON AVOIDABLE MAYBE CALL AT THE IN THE CALL BUT WE'RE NOT GONNA SEE IS BIG A DIFFERENCE WE THOUGHT. AYE I SITTING HERE I HAVE NO SENSE OF WHAT IN ROOM IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE R. N. AND I WOULD ASSUME YOU GUYS IN A BETTER POSITION SO I GUESS THE QUESTION HERE IS HAVE YOU DONE ANY YOU CAN YOU CAN YOU ELABORATE A ANY RESEARCH THAT YOU'VE DONE. AND DO YOU HAVE PLANS TO DO ANY FURTHER DEEPER. RESEARCH AND IF NOT WHY NOT. YOU SEE MAN. OF ONE OF. AND THE- SEARCH. THAT THE L. A. L. SO WE DID- SURVEYED RESPECT STUDENTS WE ALSO HAVE PART. WHERE THEIR RESEARCH PLANE GROUP TO UNDER. WHAT'S WHAT WE ARE HEARING FROM STUDENTS IS THAT. THEY ARE SEEKING IN ASKING FOR GREATER FLEXIBILITY IN OUR COURSES AND HYBRID. MUCH OF THIS AGAIN RELATED TO THE NEED TO WORK FOR NECESSITY AND WITH 61% OF OUR STUDENTS AGAIN. WORKING A SOLE PROVIDERS- AND FOR THEIR FAMILIES. AND SO. DYNAMIC OF- BEING ABLE TO. RE ENTER THE WORKFORCE AND HIGHER WAGE SPECIALLY FOR THOSE THAT MAY HAVE LOST INCOME. DURING THE PANDEMIC IS VERY APPEALING ESPECIALLY FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS. WE ARE SEEING SOME ENROLLMENT GAINS IN SOME AREAS OF STATE ALL HIGHLIGHT ON THE- H. SANTIAGO IS HAD- WHENEVER DISTRICTS IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. HAS HAD SOME GAMES. THE LOOK THE SECOND PIECE OF YOUR OF WHAT DO WE OTHER. WE DO HAVE CONTINUED TO SERVE FOLLOWINGS CENSUS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT IS ALSO RELEASING GRANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO RESEARCH THIS PHENOMENON THAT'S HAPPENING NATIONWIDE WE WILL BE PARTNERING WITH TO- RESEARCH ENTITIES. TO HELP US BRING CAPACITY TO BETTER UNDERSTAND THIS ISSUE I'M SO WE ARE VERY INTERESTED ON WE WANT TO BRING BACK STUDENTS BUT WE ALSO WANT TO ENSURE THAT OUR COLLEGES ARE NOT LOSING RESOURCES AS A RESULT OF THESE DECLINES YEAH- AND SO I GUESS I'LL CHANGE MY SECOND COMMENT. THE CRITICAL QUESTION- SO. I'M IT IS FROM IS NEVER ABOUT YOUR THOUGHTS ON AND THE PROPER BLAND GOING FORWARD. ONLINE HYBRID AND IN PERSON. AND SO I JUST HAPPEN TO HAVE THE EXPERIENCE RIGHT NOW MY BABYSITTER IS LOOKING TO ENROLL IN COMMUNITY COLLEGE CLASSES. ARE AND SHE WAS NOT ABLE TO FIND ANY IN PERSON I THINK SHE FOUND ONE IN PERSON CLASS NEARBY- AND SHE DOESN'T WANT TO DO ONLINE AND SO SHE'S. YOU KNOW REFRAINING FROM AND ROLLING RIGHT NOW- BUT AT THE SAME TIME YOU MENTION THE FLEXIBILITY THAT AND PRESUMABLY ONLINE AND HYBRID PROVIDE MORE THAT SO. WHAT DO YOU THINK THE RIGHT BLEND IS SORT OF WHAT I'M AND OBVIOUSLY THIS IS GONNA BE DIFFERENT DISTRICT BY DISTRICT BASIS BUT- MOVING FORWARD. HOW MUCH ONLINE VERSUS IN PERSON VERSUS HYBRID YOU ANTICIPATE IT WILL BE THE RIGHT MIX FOR YOUR- DIFFERENT COLLEGES GOING FOR. I BELIEVE YOU'RE RIGHT. HIGHLY THE RATE MAKE IS REALLY GOING TO BE DIFFERENT- FOR INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS BUT IT ALSO WILL BE DIFFERENT. DEPENDING ON- THAT PROGRAM OF STUDY. MANY OF OUR- VAST MAJORITY OF OUR CAREER EDUCATION PROGRAMS ARE FULLY IN PERSON RIGHT NOW. THE RIGHT NEXT FOR THOSE- GIVEN THE ON HANDS ON IS IN THAT IN PERSON- AS PART OF ON SOME OF THESE ANALYSIS WE HEARD THAT- AROUND 27% OF STUDENTS PREFERRED- FULLY ONLINE. OTHERS WANTED A BLANK TODAY WHAT WHAT WE'VE HEARD ALSO WAS A BIG ONE IN PERSON STUDENTS SUPPORTS WHICH COLLEGES ARE- INCREASINGLY OFFERING- AND CONTINUE TO PROVIDE WHETHER IT'S COUNSELING- FOOD BANKS ARE SO WOULD REALLY WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS JUST A DYNAMIC SHIFT IN HOW STUDENTS. WANT THEIR EDUCATION IT'S GOING TO BE CRITICAL FOR COLLEGES TO CONTINUALLY- SURVEY BOCA'S SCRIPT OR STUDENTS SO THAT THEY CAN ADOPT- HE WILL NEED TO BE FLEXIBLE. AND SUPPORT THEM DURING THESE TIMES. THANK YOU AND I WOULD ASSESS MYSELF WITH THE COMMENTS OF GERMAN LAYERED AYE AYE AYE. I STILL AM NOT CLEAR ON ON WHAT THE RIGHT ENROLLMENT STRATEGY IS AND I KNOW WE'RE GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS IF. OUR SKIFF OR WHATEVER HAVE YOU PRONOUNCE THAT SOON- BUT- I IF YOU KNOW I DO FEEL LIKE WERE ADDED TO REFER TO MY EARLIER COMMENT WHAT WORK WE'RE SHOOTING DARTS. WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT DIRECTION WE'RE SUPPOSED TO THROW THEM IN AT THIS POINT BECAUSE- THERE'S JUST SUCH A- I'M A MIX A MYRIAD OF FACTORS AS WE SAID. ON WHAT COULD BE CAUSING THIS AND ROMAN DECLINE IS VERY HARD FOR ME SITTING HERE. TO FIGURE OUT. WHAT THE RIGHT ENROLLMENT STRATEGIES ARE GONNA BE GOING FORWARD BECAUSE IT IT DOES STRIKE ME THAT THAT WE MAY BE SEEING. A DECLINE OVER THE LONG RUN IN ENROLLMENT IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE MAY HAVE TO THINK ABOUT ADDRESSING. AND IDEALLY PROACTIVELY RATHER THAN RETROACTIVELY BUT- MAYBE I'M WRONG BUT I THINK IT WOULD BE HELPFUL HERE. THANK YOU CENTER BERMAN. AN OF THAT COMPLETES OUR DISCUSSION OF ISSUE ONE AND WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ISSUE NUMBER TWO WHICH WE HAVE TALKED IN PART ABOUT ALREADY SO- IT'S THE PORTION MEN'S INCREASE ARM AND THE PANELS EXACTLY THE SAME AS ISSUE ONE AND SO WHAT- LET'S GO IN THE SAME ORDER AND LET'S- BEGIN WITH DAN HOW'RE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF. HANAUER OF THE DEPART OF FINDING. AT DINNER TO PREVENT A FINANCE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES THE STATUTORY STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT OF FIVE POINT 33% WHICH TRANSLATES TO FOUR HUNDRED NINE POINT FOUR MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FURTHER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES FUNDING FOR POINT 5% ENROLLMENT GROWTH COMING TO TWENTY FOUR POINT NINE MILLION- THIS IS REALLY MORE OF A TECHNICAL ADJUSTMENT AND PROVIDES FUNDING WHICH CAN BE USED BY DISTRICTS THAT HAPPEN TO BE GROWING AND ANY UNUSED GROWTH FUNDING IS POTENTIALLY BE ABLE TO COVER INCREASES TO A DISTRICTS SUPPLEMENTAL OR SUCCESS ALLOCATIONS. WITHOUT A MAP YOU TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THE SUBSTANCE THANK YOU VERY MUCH NOW WILL MOVE TO THE LA- THANK YOU CHAIRMAN WHERE'D- YES DODD- COMMITTEE JUST TALKED ABOUT THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH ISSUE THE LAST DAM IN IN IN THE GENDER ISSUE ONE SO I'LL FOCUS ON THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT PROPOSAL AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT RATE FOR TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE IS LIKELY TO BE HIGHER. THAN WHAT THE GOVERNOR IS PROPOSING- THE FIVE POINT 33% OUR OFFICE ESTIMATES THAT THE CALL RATE IS GOING TO BE MORE LIKE SIX POINT 2% OF FOR NEXT YEAR I WHICH WOULD COST ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS MORE THAN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROPOSING. THAT DISTRICTS ARE FACING A NUMBER OF COST PRESSURES IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE FIRST YOU HAVE EMPLOYEES THEIR OWN COST OF LIVING HAS GONE UP SO THERE IS PRESSURE ON DISTRICTS PROVIDE SALARY INCREASES FOR EMPLOYEES DISTRICTS ALSO HAVE. REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO CALPERS AND CAL STARS AND THAT AMOUNT IS GOING TO GO UP IN TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BY ABOUT A HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN TOTAL AND DISTRICTS ARE ALSO FACING COST PRESSURES- RELATED TO THE COMING EXPIRATION OF THE FEDERAL RELIEF FUNDS THAT DISTRICTS ARE ALSO REALIZING SOME SAVINGS AND THE CURRENT YEAR BECAUSE THEY DON'T NEED AS MANY PART IME FACULTY I DO TO LOWER. COURSE DEMANDS AND IF THAT TREND CONTINUES NEXT YEAR DISTRICTS WILL CONTINUE TO SEE SAVINGS BUT THAT SAVINGS LIKELY WILL NOT BE ENOUGH TO OFFSET THE UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE TOTAL COMPENSATION COSTS FOR TWO TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE THAT I JUST MENTIONED SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE MAKE A DECISION ON A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT RATE ONCE A LEGISLATURE GETS UPDATED DATA FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. WHICH IS USED TO CALCULATE THE COLA RATE AND SO LEGISLATURE GET THAT BY APRIL AND IN TIME TO MAKE A DECISION BY. MAY ON WHAT THAT REFRACT RAY IT WILL BE- LOOKING IS WELL AS WHAT NINETY EIGHT NET NEW GEAR LOW LIKE A REVENUE EXPECTATIONS MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. DETERMINE LAYERED I JUST WANT TO REITERATE SOME OF HE POINTS SHARED BY MY COLLEAGUE AT THE ALLEY- DISTRICTS ARE FACING INCREASING COST PRESSURES SUCH AS THOSE OF PENSION COSTS OF OPERATING- AND- DOES NEEDED TO ADDRESS INFLATIONARY COSTS. ALSO HIGHLIGHT ON A RECENT ECONOMIC IMPACT REPORT THAT WE RELEASED THAT SHOWS THAT FOR EVERY DOLLAR SPENT ON EDUCATING STUDENTS WHO ATTEND COMMITTEE COLLEGES THE PUBLIC'S RECEIVES TWO POINT TWO DOLLARS AND TEN CENTS IN RETURN- AND WE HAVE AN ECONOMIC IMPACT- OF ONE HUNDRED TWENTY EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY I SHARE THESE JUST TO HIGHLIGHT. THAT CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS A WORTHY ONE AND WE PROVIDE IN OUR CENTRAL CONTRIBUTORS TO CALIFORNIA ECONOMY AND WITH THAT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU OUR WORK ME ASK OF. A MAKE A COMMENT NASCO QUESTION OF FINANCE AND THAT IS I WAS GOING TO ASK IS A QUESTION. A NEW ISSUE WE DO THINK THE FIVE POINT THAT INTERCOM SO. GIVEN THE L. A. O.'S COMMENT ABOUT- PROBABLY THE- THE TRUING UP OF ACTUAL REVENUES OUT OF IN THE SPRING WOULD PROBABLY TO A HIGHER COLA I WAS JUST GONNA S. FINANCE TO EXPECT YOU TO DO THAT TRUING UP AND IT COME TO US WITH AN UP TO DATE NUMBER IN MAY. I'VE BEEN IN OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- YESTERDAY TYPICALLY BE WE- REVISIT THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT WHEN IT COMES TO THEIR MAY REVISION- AND TYPICALLY REVISED THAT NUMBER BASED ON ON ON THE UPDATED STATUTORY COLLECTOR SAYING. KAY AND THEN THE OTHER QUESTION I HAVE FOR YOU- AND IT MAY BE TRICKY FOR YOU- ED THAT IS- WHEN THE GOVERNOR ANNOUNCED THE SURPLUS. BOB IN NOVEMBER WERE RIVER WAS- HE SAID THAT- OF BY DOWN AND CAL. CALPERS AND CAL STIRS WAS GOING TO BE IS NUMBER ONE PRIORITY AND THEN IT'S NOT IN THE BUDGET ANYWHERE. IN SO I WAS JUST GONNA ASK YOU IS. IS A ASSISTANCE TO LOCAL DISTRICTS. ARE ON CALPERS AND CAL STIRS SOMETHING THAT'S ON THE TABLE. ARE HEADING TOWARD MASS. AND AS YOU KNOW THERE THERE IS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET DOES NOT CONTAIN A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL THE PROPOSAL RELATED TO CALPERS MCALISTER'S- IN TERMS OF WHAT CONVERSATIONS ARE ONGOING AND I'D HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE THAT FINANCE TO COVER THOSE ISSUES MORE SPECIFICALLY. TO ONE OKAY OUR CONVERSATIONS ARE ON GOING IS THE EUPHEMISM WE'VE BEEN GETTING SO I APPRECIATE THAT BUT IT'S- WE HOPE THERE'S AN ONGOING CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. US SENATOR MEN DO YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS ON THE SIDE OF. OUR HE DOES NOT- SO THANK THAT PANEL. WHO IS NOW GOING TO RETURNED IN THE EXACT SAME FORM. OF FOR ISSUE NUMBER THREE THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA- WHICH THE ACRONYM FOR WHICH IS SKIFT WHICH PEOPLE USE DURING THIS SO FOR THOSE OF YOU FOLLOWING AT HOME THAT MEANS STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA- OUR PANELISTS MISSED. OUR OVERVIEW VIEW HEARING OF ONE K. TO TWELVE FUNDING WHERE THERE WAS A WARRANT ACRONYMS IN THIS HEARING AND- FROM. AND A- CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION PLOY HE BROKE THE RECORD BY HAVING FOR UNDEFINED ACRONYMS IN ONE SENTENCE AND SO- JUST CAUTION YOU TO BE CAREFUL BECAUSE I MIGHT INTERRUPT AND ASK YOU TO. TO DEFINE AN ACRONYM IF YOU VEER OFF THE TRACKS IT IN THAT DIRECTION. SO LET'S BEGIN THE DISCUSSION ON THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA- AND WE'LL GO ON THE SAME ORDER WITH THE SAME PEOPLE START WITH DAN HANNAH WERE FROM. THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. IN THERE ARE IF I AND WILL TRY THE WARY OF MY- YOU ADMIN. ONGOING CAN TO THIS CENTER FUNDING FORMULA OR SCIFI PHYSICAL CONDITIONS POSED BY THE LAST FEW YEARS THE FORMULA HAS PROVED RESILIENT IN A STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR THE COLLEGES- DIMINISHES. FOCUSED ON MOVING TOWARDS FULL IMPLEMENTATION OF THE FUNDING FORMULA. AS SUCH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED A GRADUAL PHASE OUT OF THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. EXISTING HOLD HARMLESS ROVISION IS SLATED TO EXPIRE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE. ADMINISTRATION PROPOSES TO CREATE A FUNDING FLOOR USING TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE FUNDING LEVELS. ALLOWING FUNDING RATES TO CONTINUE TO INCREASE BY THE STATUTORY COST OF LVING ADJUSTMENT. BUT REMOVING THE APPLICATION OF THAT COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT TO THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION BEGINNING IN TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. OBJECTIVELY THIS APPROACH ALLOWS DISTRICTS TO TRANSITION TO THE CORE FUNDING FORMULA OVER TIME. WHILE PREVENTING PHYSICAL DECLINES BETWEEN TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE AND TWENTY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX. THE PAGES OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO SIGNAL INTEREST IN THE ADMINISTRATION TO INCLUDE FIRST GENERATION STUDENTS. WITHIN THE SUPPLEMENTAL ALLOCATION OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. IN LINE WITH THE RECOMMENDATION MADE BY THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. ONCE A RELIABLE AND STABLE DATA SOURCE IS AVAILABLE. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THESE PROPOSALS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH I WILL MOVE TO THE LA AREA. STILL IN ISSUE ONE. WE ARE THIS THIS COMMITTEE HEARD THE DISCUSSION ABOUT. ABOUT FORTY DISTRICTS THAT ARE KIND OF PROPPED UP WITH THEIR FUNDING DURING THE PANDEMIC BECAUSE OF EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE WELL THERE'S ANOTHER GROUP OF DISTRICTS ABOUT TWENTY DISTRICTS THAT RECEIVE FUNDING UNDER A HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION IN THIS IS A PROVISION THAT WAS ENACTED WHEN THE STATE MOVED TO THE NEW FUNDING FORMULA IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN AND THAT MONEY IS WAS WAS INTENDED FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THAT. GOTTEN THE WOULD HAVE GENERATED LESS UNDER THE NEW FORMULA FORMULA IN THE OLD FUNDING FORMULA SO DISTRICTS LIKE REAL COLLEGE WHICH CHAIR GERMAN LEARN I KNOW YOU KNOW- A GREAT DEAL ABOUT SO THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE IS INTENDED TO PREVENT- MANY DISTRICTS THOSE HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICTS FROM HITTING A FISCAL CLIFF IN A FEW YEARS WHEN THE STATE'S CURRENT HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION IS SCHEDULED TO END. AND DISTRICTS ARE FUNDED BASED ON WHAT THEY GENERATE THROUGH THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA SO INSTEAD OF HAVING TO SIGNIFICANTLY CUT THEIR BUDGETS BY TWENTY FIVE TWENTY SIX UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET OF THOSE DISTRICTS APPORTIONMENT FUNDING AMOUNT WOULD BE CAPPED AT THEIR TWENTY FOUR TWENTY FIVE LEVEL. NOW BECAUSE UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THE WHOLE TOM HARMLESS FUNNY LEVEL WOULD NOT RECEIVE ANY SUBSEQUENT COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS BUT THE RATES UNDER THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WOULD RECEIVE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS THE INTENSE BY THE GOVERNOR IS THAT OVER TIME THIS STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WOULD GENERATE MORE MONEY FOR THOSE DISTRICTS THE SO CALLED HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICTS SUCH SAID EVENTUALLY. THERE ARE- THEY WOULD BE RISK MORE MONEY UNDER AS THAT THEM HOLD HARMLESS AMOUNT AND THEY WOULD BE ON THE FORMULA FINALLY SO TO SPEAK. SO WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S GOAL OF PREVENTING A FISCAL CLIFF IS LAUDABLE. AT THE SAME TIME BEING A DISTRICT THAT RECEIVES HOLD HARMLESS FUNDING MEANS THAT THEY'RE RECEIVING MONEY FROM THE STATE REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY STUDENTS THEY SERVE THE TYPE OF STUDENTS THEY SERVE. OR THE OUTCOME OF THOSE STUDENTS AS SUCH. BEING FUNDED ON HOLD HARMLESS GETTING MONEY. NO MATTER WHAT BASED ON MONEY THAT THEY GOT IN THE IN THE PRIOR FORMULA. IT DOES CREATE POOR INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS AND THE STATE REALLY SHOULD STRIVE TO GET DISTRICTS OFF HOLD HARMLESS AND FUNDED BY THE FORMULA. AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. ONE WAY TO DO THAT IS TO INCREASE THE VALUE OF THE CURRENT OF PORTION OF FUNDING FORMULA. YOU COULD DO THAT BY INCREASING THE BASE PROVIDING MORE FUNDING FOR THE BASIN THIS NUMBER MENTIONED THAT. EARLIER YOU COULD INCREASE IT BEYOND THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS THAT WAS SO WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE APPROVED THE GOVERNOR'S SCHOOL HARMLESS PROPOSAL THE ONE THAT. MISTER HOWARD JUST MENTIONED BUT NO FURTHER BY BEGINNING TO EXPLORE THE POSSIBILITY OF RAISING BASE RATES FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA. THE LEGISLATURE COULD SET A TARGET LEVEL OF BASE FUNDING THAT WOULD LIKE TO SEE GIVEN. EXPECTED GROWTH IN THE PROPOSITION. NINETY EIGHT. GUARANTEE AN END OF A MULTI YOU PLAN FOR DO YOU REACH THOSE OF FUNDING TARGETS. NOW AND A HUNDRED HIGHER BASE ALSO HAS THE ADVANTAGE OF HELPING DISTRICTS ADDRESS THEIR OPERATING COSTS WHICH OF. THE SUN COMMITTEE- HEARD AND THE PRIOR ITS AGENDA ITEM. SO ONE OTHER NO ALL MENTION US IN THE AGENDA- WE DO AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR THAT ADDING A FIRST GENERATION METRIC. TO THE FOR A STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA HAS MERIT ONCE THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DOES START TO RECEIVE MORE CONSISTENT RELIABLE DATA FROM COLLEGES SO IT'S SOMETHING A MOVE TOWARD- IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS. BOB EARLIER- THIS COMMITTEE TALKED ABOUT THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOW IT SO WE ARE JUST RECOMMENDED ARE ANALYSIS THE LEGISLATURE GREAT GAIN CLARITY ABOUT WHAT EXACTLY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS GOING TO USE WHAT CRITERIA IS GONNA USE IN DETERMINING WHETHER TO EXTEND THE EMERGENCY CONDITIONS ALLOWANCE. FOR ANOTHER YEAR OR SOMETHING YOU YOU HEARD A LITTLE BIT ABOUT- PREVIOUSLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH CHAU WILL MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LAYERED THE GOVERNOR AGAIN HIGHLIGHTS ITS COMMITMENT FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA PROPOSES MINIMUM FUNDING LEVEL FOR ALL DISTRICTS. THEY DON'T. HAVE THAT DROP THAT- HOST SPECIFIED PREVIOUSLY. ASSUMED CENTER FUNDING FORMULA IS A KEY PART OF SOLUTIONS TO AN EQUITABLE RECOVERY. AS YOU KNOW PRIOR TO THE SCF FAST. DISTRICTS WORK FUNDED ALMOST ENTIRELY BY ENROLLMENT AND WHAT WE'VE LEARNED IS THAT THAT APPROACH TO. IT DOESN'T WORK TO ADVANCE THE STUDENTS FULL EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY BEYOND THEIR INITIAL ENROLLMENT. AND IT WOULD NOT WORK FOR DISTRICTS IN THE MIST OF DEMOGRAPHIC SHIFTS ACROSS THE STATE AND THEY WOULD HAVE SEEN ENROLLMENT DECLINES AND AS A RESULT- UNDIES AND ROMINGER DECLINED AGAIN WERE EXPERIENCED EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC. AS A RESULT WOULD HAVE LOST MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. EVEN BEFORE. THE IMPLIED CLASS THIS INCIDENT FORMING FUNDING FORMULA RECOGNIZES THAT COLLEGES- TO WORK ENCOMPASSES MORE. AND THAT THEIR EFFORTS AROUND CRITICAL ACADEMIC AND STUDENT SUPPORTS ARE IMPORTANT. AS WE SUPPORT. PULLED CENTRAL FOUR TWENTY IS A CLIFF DISTRICT. THIS CHANGE. TO CALL WITH THE STATE. AS WORKED REGAIN CAL. FURTHER THE DRIVING OF SCF MATURE. EQUITY AND SIX ARE MORE RELEVANT THAN EVER AND REMIND US THAT OUR STUDENTS NIECE NEEDS COME FIRST. EARLY INDICATORS- SHOW THAT UNDER THE SCF FIVE STATEWIDE SUCCEEDED REFER CAN'T TRANSFER COMPLETIONS I LOW INCOME STUDENTS HAVE IT INCREASED BY ROUGHLY THIRTY FIVE PERCENT. THERE'S BEEN A 69% INCREASE IN COMPLETIONS OR TRANSFER LEVEL ENGLISH AND MATH IN THE FIRST YEAR AND FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS THEY'VE SEEN EVEN LARGER GAINS WITH. 89% INCREASE FOR PELL GRANT RECIPIENTS AND 90% INCREASES FOR PROMISE GRANT RECIPIENTS. STATEWIDE INCREASES AND REGIONAL LIVING WAGE FOR LOW INCOME STUDENTS ARE NEARLY TWENTY PERCENT. SO AGAIN WE BELIEVE THAT WE ARE FOCUSING ON THE RIGHT- AREAS THAT ARE COLLEGES ARE WORKING HARD TO KEEP. STUDENTS NEED THAT BEFORE. THANK YOU HAVE A CHANCE. THANK YOU ARE WE'RE GONNA TO QUESTIONS THE END OF. THE L. A. O. ANSWERED MY FIRST QUESTION WHICH WAS HOW MANY COLLEGE DISTRICTS ARE IN HOLD HARMLESS. AND- DANCER WHO WAS TWENTY ARE THERE ARE SOME LARGE DISTRICTS THAT ARE IN THERE I'VE HEARD ANECDOTALLY ABOUT A FEW. DOES ANYBODY KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION. SENATOR LAYERED LAWCENTER AT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THERE ARE- SOME LARGER DISTRICTS WHICH INTEREST OFFICE HAS PRODUCED A DASHBOARD WHICH SHOWS REAL TIME DATA AND WORK ON DISTRICTS ARE I'M HAPPY TO SHARE THAT- WE PROVIDED A LINK- DURING THE PRE HEARING AROUND. THIS INFORMATION- THAT SHOWS THAT STORY COULD YOU TELL US MAYBE TWO OR THREE LARGE DISTRICTS NOW WITHOUT US HAVING TO GO TO THE DASHBOARD WERE INTENSELY THAT'S LISTENING IN- WE SHOW SIX OF SAN PROCEED S. AS TWO EXAMPLES. OKAY THANK AND LOS ANGELES IS NOT IN THERE. LOS ANGELES IS IN THERE IT IS IN THEIR- COURT OKAY BECAUSE THAT'S A FAIRLY LARGE DISTRICT I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE. OF THE LA- HAS HIS HAND. YES SORRY I RECALL SAN DIEGO ME BECAUSE DISTRICT IS A HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICTS. LOS ANGELES LEGISLATURE HAVE TO SEE WHEN THE CHANCE OFFICE RELEASES- ARE UPDATED INFORMATION ON FUNDING FOR THE CURRENT YEAR I DID NOTICE THAT- LOS ANGELES WAS UNDER A HOLD HARMLESS AS OF JUNE OF LAST YEAR BUT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THAT CHANGED- SO JUST JUST WANT TO MENTION THAT THAT THAT'S SOMETHING THAT. LEGISLATURE WON'T KNOW FOR ANOTHER COUPLE WEEKS I DID JUST WANT TO MENTION AS WELL BACK TO- YOU TEND TO SEE A ONE TENDS TO SEE MORE HOLD HARMLESS DISTRICTS AND COASTAL AREAS OF THE STATE THE BAY AREA AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE EWER STUDENTS ARE DEFINED AS LOW INCOME DEFINED AS LOW INCOME BY THAT STUDENT CENTERED FORM FUNDING FORMULA AND STATUTES AND SO. EVERY COLLEGES IN EXAMPLE ONE THE SANTA CRUZ AREA SO COASTAL CALIFORNIA BEARING I THINK YOU'D SEE HAS A DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THOSE HARMS DISCUSS ANY YES AND WHAT I WAS TRYING TO GET AT ALSO IS THAT WALLETS TWENTY DISTRICTS IN UNDER 20% OF THE TOTAL DISTRICTS IT WAS MY SUSPICION IT'S A MUCH HIGHER NUMBER OF THE TOTAL STUDENT BODY. OF THE STATE BECAUSE OF THE LARGE DISTRICTS THAT'S ONE OF THE THINGS I WAS DRIVING. AND UNFORTUNATELY. A MOST OF THE COMMUNITY KERR TO IN MY DISTRICT IN COURT HARMLESS AND I AM INTIMATE FAMILIAR WITH THEIR VIEWS ON THE MATTER AND- I SUSPECT WOULD. WHEN THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID IN THE OPENING STATEMENT THAT THE FORMULA REMAINS RESILIENT THEY HAVE A SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT DEFINITION OF WHAT RESILIENCE MEANS IN RELATION TO THE FORMULA. SO THE- V. A. N. IT'S INTERESTING BECAUSE THE DISTRICTS YOU MENTIONED ARE THE ONES WHERE THERE'S A- A RATHER HIGHER STANDARD OF LIVING AND I KNOW EVEN THE SENATE OFFERS A- A PAY DIFFERENTIAL. FOLLOWED TO POISON HARDTO FIT IN HIGH INCOME AREAS WHERE IT'S HARD TO FIND HOUSING. IN THAT THERE WAS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WAS CHARGED WITH WALKING AT. WAS WHETHER OR NOT. FROM THERE SHOULD BE ADJUSTMENTS FOR DIFFERENCES IN REGIONAL COST OF LIVING AND I NOTICED THERE'S NO RECOMMENDATION HERE ABOUT THAT. WHY IS THAT THE CASE AND I DON'T KNOW WHO CAN TAKE THAT QUESTION CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. DINNERWARE AND IT'S- IT IS OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE I DID NOT- LAND DATA AND SCHOOL RECOMMENDATION AROUND THE REGIONAL COST OF LIVING ISSUE AND SO NOTHING WAS PUT FORWARD SHE THE ADMINISTRATION OF THE LEGISLATURE- THAT SPECIFIED HOW ARE THAT COULD BE CONSIDERED- THERE WERE HOWEVER RECOMMENDATIONS AROUND A FIRST GENERATION- WHICH COULD HELP MIDDLEMAN ASK ABOUT THE FIRST GENERATION UNLESS YOU'RE DRAWING A CONCLUSION. IN RELATION TO MY QUESTION. HI MY JUST THE CONCLUDE- WOULD BE THAT ONE OPTION AGAIN IS TO CONSIDER FIRST GENERATION BECAUSE THAT COULD ALSO BECOME THIS- INDIVIDUALS IN SOME OF THOSE DISTRICTS THAT YOU HIGHLIGHTED I'M GOING TO ASK ABOUT THAT IN A MOMENT BUT- THE- OHIO. IS RATHER FLIGHTY WITH HIS RAISED HANDS IT WAS UP IN ITS DOWN SO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANYTHING THAT YOU WANTED TO ADD TO THAT. IT'S NOT YOU WELL YEAH I JUST TO MAKE THE POINT DONE. IN VERY WHAT IS THAT NUMBER IT SAID IS THAT THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE. LOOKED AT THE- THE- IDEA OF. MAKING ADJUSTMENTS TO THE SCF AFTER REFLECT HIGHER COST OF LIVING- AREAS OF THE STATE AND ULTIMATELY DID NOT. AGREE AND DID NOT HAVE A RECOMMENDATION SO THAT WAS NOT SOMETHING THAT THEY HAD. RECOMMENDED FOR- ME JUST MAKE A COMMENT I THINK THAT'S UNFORTUNATE AND WE SHOULD NOT LET GO OF THE ISSUE. BECAUSE WE'VE GOT THE SITUATION. WHERE THE HOLD HARMLESS AGREEMENT IS CUTTING SUBSTANTIALLY COLLEGE DISTRICTS IN HIGH INCOME AREAS. AND SO THEY GET A DOUBLE WHAMMY. ARE THEY CAN'T HIRE PEOPLE BECAUSE OF THE HIGH INTEREST AND THEY'RE GOING TO BE CUT SUBSTANTIALLY SO. SOMEBODY NEEDS TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND- BECAUSE THEY DEADLOCKED IS NOT AN ADEQUATE RESPONSE WHEN WE GO OUT TO THESE DISTRICTS AND SAY WE'RE NOT ADDRESSING THE. ISSUE SO I HOPE THAT SOMEHOW. ASSEMBLY CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY FOR US TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE THEN ON THE RECOMMENDATION. ON THE METRIC OF THE FIRST GENERATION- A STUDENT WHICH IS IN HERE. ARM ON THE POLICY LEVEL OF COURSE IT MAKES TOTAL SENSE BUT I CAN'T TELL ANYWHERE IN HERE WHAT THE IMPACT IS TO INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS DO WE KNOW IF IT'S ADDED WHAT THAT DOES TO INDIVIDUAL. DISTRICTS ON THE FORMULA. I WOULD START WITH THE OF THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE BUT WE CAN GO ANYWHERE ON THIS. THE NEW LAYERED- CURRENTLY THERE. THE DEFINITION FOR FIRST GENERATION THAT WAS RECOMMENDED BY THE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE WAS NOT ONE THAT- COMMUNITY COLLEGES REPORTED WERE COLLECTED THAT CHANGE WAS MADE TWO YEARS AGO AND SO WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO COLLECT THAT INFORMATION TO HAVE CONSISTENCY. ANY METRICS TIED TO FUNDINGGENERALLY HAVE MULTI YEARS THAT WE CAN REFERENCE HER ALSO AUDITED NUMBERS SO THAT WE CAN PROVIDE ACCOUNTABILITY NEITHER OF THOSE ELEMENTS EXIST RIGHT NOW WE DON'T HAVE CONSISTENT DATA AND THEREFORE- WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THAT IMPACT WOULD BE ON INDIVIDUAL DISTRICTS BROUGHT ME JUST SAY THAT'S A MATTER OF GREAT CONCERN BECAUSE WE'RE SITTING HERE FIDDLING WITH THE IMPACTS OF THE LAST FORMULA. WHICH HAD STRONG IMPACTS ON DIFFERENT DISTRICTS AND NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A CHANGE IN THE FORMULA WITH NO IDEA HOW IT IMPACTS THE DISTRICT'S EVEN ON A POLICY LEVEL WE ALL THINK THA MAKES GREAT SENSE AS A METRIC AND SO I THINK. I WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A COMFORT LEVEL THAT WE'RE NOT GONNA HAVE A GROUP OF ANGRY DISTRICTS COMING BACK TO US NEXT YEAR BECAUSE THEY ALL SAY WE DIDN'T SEE THIS COMING SO- THERE'S GOTTA BE A WAY TO FIGURE THAT OUT AND I THINK. IT IN GEERAL ON THIS AND YES I REPRESENTS. A LOT OF DISTRICTS THAT ARE. THAT ARE SUBJECT TO THE HOLD HARMLESS AND I THINK THERE'S THESE LARGER ISSUES SAN JUAN AND I APOLOGIZE FOR TELLING- THIS STORY OVER AND OVER AGAIN HOME BUT IT RELATES IN SOME WAYS IT TO THE THERE'S ALL THE SENATE ONCE AGAIN THIS IS TIED TO FOUR OTHER ITEMS SUCH AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND SOME OF AND HOUSING AND SOME OF THE OTHER ITEMS THAT WE ARE STILL GOING TO CONTINUE. TO COST LATER IN THE END OF. AND OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE. HAVE OF THE DOOR GOALS OF FLY LEARNING AND TRANSFER BILL. WHICH IS REALLY THE CENTER OF THE OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA IN MANY WAYS AND BY TAKING AWAY REPEATABILITY. HAND SORT OF WEAKENING THE LIFELONG LEARNING PART OF THE DEAL WILL GOALS. THE LOCAL SUPPORT FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES IS DROPPED SO I WAS THE CO CHAIR% OF THE CAMPAIGN FOR THE FIRST TIME IN THIRTY YEARS FOR A BOND MEASURE. AND WHEN WE WENT IN THE LAST YEAR REQUIRED TWO THIRDS NINETEEN NINETY EIGHT WE GOT 74% OF THE VOTE. AND ONCE REPEATABILITY WAS TAKEN AWAY AND LOCAL SUPPORT STARTED TO A TOLD LANE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TWICE THEY COULD NOT GET 55% AND YEP WHEN WE GO FURTHER IN THIS AGENDA ONE OF THE REASONS WHY COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE SAID TO BE CONSIDERED DIFFERENTLY THAN YOU SEE AND CSU. IS THE LOCAL ABILITY TO GO TO TAXES WHICH HAS BEEN WEAKENED BY THE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL WAY WE LOOK AT COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AND THE TIRED STORY I KEEP TELLING THEY SET IN THAT BALLOT MEASURE. WAS A STE A CENTER IN WATSONVILLE THAT WAS EIGHT MILES FROM THE CAMPUS BUT WE KNOW ARM ROMAN WENT UP DRAMATICALLY FROM DISADVANTAGED STUDENTS AT ONE TRAVEL EIGHT MILES TO THE CAMPUS BECAUSE WE DID THAT CENTER. AND IF THERE IS A- A COMPACTION BECAUSE OF THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA AND NO HOLD HARMLESS. THAT'S LIKELY ONE OF THE THINGS TO GO BECAUSE YOUR CORE CAMPUSES WHAT'S GOING TO BE PROTECTED. AND THE COUNTERINTUITIVE THING ABOUT THIS. SAN THE FORMULA ON STUDENTS IN A WAR MANY OF WHOM ARE DISADVANTAGED WHAT WILL HAVE A- A COUNTERINTUITIVE OUTCOME AND SO- THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS I'VE NOT BEEN A TOTAL FAN. AND I HAVE TO SUBSCRIBE TO SOME OF THE COMMENTS THAT THE L. A. O. MADE. IN THE SENSE THAT THIS CREATES. A PERMANENT FLOOR THAT REMOVES INCENTIVES AND I THINK IT IS GREAT TO HAVE THE HOLD HARMLESS EXTENDED IN SOME FORM. BUT IT WOULD BE NICE TO FIGURE OUT A WAY IF THE BASE ACUALLY TRULY HOLD PEOPLE HARMLESS AT THEIR EXISTING LEVEL AND REWARDS AT A HIGHER LEVEL THE PEOPLE THAT ARE DOING WELL ON THE STUDENT CENTERED. FUNDING FORMULA THAT CRUDE DOESN'T CREATE WINNERS AND LOSERS THAT CREATES WINNERS AND WINNERS SO THE QUESTION IS. IS IN OUR DISCUSSION OF THIS GOING FORWARD AND OF COURSE IF WE APPROVE THE HOLD HARMLESS. AS PROPOSED BY THE GOVERNOR WE STRIVE FOR YEAR TWO TWO ADJUSTED BUT I HATE KEEP KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD I THINK IT IS REALLY ABOUT. FINDING SOME SWEET SPOT OF THAT DOES THIS AND FACTORING IN THE REGIONAL COST OF LIVING. IS SEEMS TO BE ONE OF THE THINGS THAT ACTUALLY IS AN ISSUE WITH A SOME OF THE VERY DISTRICTS THAT WERE NAMED AS BEING IN THE HOLD HARMLESS. AND I KNOW WE HAD THIS PROBLEM WHEN I WAS A COULD BRIO AND I'VE. NOT BEEN ON THE BOARD IN TWENTY YEARS. WHERE WE WERE HAVE TROUBLE. RECRUITING FACULTY BECAUSE OF THE COST OF LIVING AND SO EVERY TIME WE HAD A NEW FULL TIME FACULTY MEMBER ANNOUNCED UC SANTA CRUZ. WE SEARCH TO SEE IF THEY HAD A SPOUSE WAS GOING TO BE LOOKING FOR A JOB TO TRY TO RECRUIT THEM INTO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS A WAY TO GET AROUND THE HOUSING-ISSUE. AND SO I AM JUST HOPING. THAT THERE ARE WAYS TO ADDRESS THIS GOING FORWARD AND I THINK THIS BUDGET. HAS SOMEREALLY POSITIVE A STEPS TOWARD IT. BUT IT DOESN'T FULLY GET THE IRAN AND WHEN I WAS BUDGET CHAIR IN THE ASSEMBLY FROM 200-042-2000 EIGHT. WE HAD TO DEAL WITH WHAT WAS KNOWN AS THE EQUALIZATION ISSUE. AND WHAT HAPPENED IS THAT MANY K. THROUGH TWELVE DISTRICTS WERE LOCKED INTO THEIR FUNDING AT THE TIME OF PROP NINETY EIGHT BASED ON THE FACTORS THAT WENT THERE. AND A LOT OF THE CHANGING FACTORS WERE NOT. ARE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT BECAUSE IT WAS LOCKED IN AND THEN IS DISTRICTS CHANGE PARTICULARLY IN SUBURBAN AREAS THEY WERE DISADVANTAGED IN THE FORMULA. BECAUSE OF WHAT IT BEEN LOCKED IN BASED ON CIRCUMSTANCES THAT NO LONGER EXISTED. AND IF WE DON'T FIGURE OUT A LONG TERM SOLUTION. FOR THE STUDENT CENTERED FUNDING FORMULA WE WILL BE DOING THE SAME THING WILL BE LOCKING IN. A CIRCUMSTANCES FROM THE PAST IN A WAY THAT SOME FUTURE LEGISLATURE IN SOME FUTURE CHANCELLOR. ALTHOUGH DAM LOOKS YOUNG ENOUGH THAT HE'LL BE THE PERSON IT'LL BE HERE TRYING TO FIX IT FOR FINANCE. ARE WE WOULD THEN HAVE TO DEAL WITH THAT ARE GOING FORWARD SO. I JUST FEEL OBLIGATED TO OFFER THAT IS CONVERSATION AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE MAY REVISE AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONTINUE TO ADDRESS. SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE ALL BEEN TALKING HERE. THANK YOU. ARE TERM BY ONE COMMITTEE MEMBER THAT'S HERE AND EVERYBODY THAT'S LISTENING FOR BEARING WITH ME ON THAT BUT- BUT THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES. AND SOME BY ME YES. SIR A MAN IF ANYTHING LEFT ON THE- POSSIBLY FOR YOU TO. HER TO ABOUT HERE. I JUST WANT TO MAKE A BRIEF COMMENT AND THAT IS TO SAY I THINK CAROLERS YOU ELOQUENTLY DESCRIBED THE TENSIONS BETWEEN. THE SCF I'LL STOP USING ACRONYM- AND- THE HOLD HARMLESS AND- I WANT TO JUST. REITERATE THE COMMENTS I MADE EARLIER AND ISSUE ONE. WHICH IS I HINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT FOR US TO DRILL DOWN AND FIGURE OUT WHAT ENROLLMENT IS GONNA LOOK LIKE AND TO WHAT DEGREE. ENROLLMENT CHANGES ARE DRIVEN BY TEMPORARY COVERT RELATED ITEMS VIS A VIS LONGER STRUCTURAL ISSUES. BECAUSE IT DOES STRIKE ME THAT WE ARE SEEING PERHAPS SOME MORE THAN TEMPORARY DECLINES IN ROME AND THOSE MIGHT BE SIGNIFICANT. AND IF THAT'S THE CASE THEN THEN WE IT IS BETTER AS AS CHAIR LEONARD POINTED OUT. FOR US TO GET AHEAD OF THIS AND I'M MINDFUL OF THE FACT THAT. WE HAVE A LOT OF ISSUES IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND WE ARE RESOURCE STARVED AND WE HAVE DEPRIVED THE CCC'S. FOR SOME PERIOD OF TIME OF THE RESOURCES THAT YOU NEED TO EFFECTIVELY EDUCATE OUR STUDENTS. AT THE SAME TIME A FOR FACING MAJOR STRUCTURAL DECLINES IN ENROLLMENT. THE THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TO REALLY TAKE INTO ACCOUNT AS WE DECIDE HOW TO ALLOCATE SCARCE RESOURCES SO- YOU KNOW I WOULD JUST ENCOURAGE. AS PART OF THIS PROCESS. ARE FROM MY PURCHASE ONE OF THREE MEMBERS OF THIS SUBCOMMITTEE. THAT IT WOULD BE REALLY REALLY HELPFUL FOR US TO HAVE MORE DATA. ON ON WHAT IS IN ROOM IT'S GONNA LOOK LIKE BECAUSE I REALLY DON'T HAVE ANY SENSE RIGHT NOW- YOU KNOW IN FIVE YEARS WHAT IS THE TOTAL AGGREGATE ROOM IN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE SYSTEM LOOK LIKE. AND WHAT IS THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL RESOURCES THAT WE SHOULD BE PUSHING THEIR- THANK YOU SENATOR REALLY APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS. IN AND THANKS TO EVERY PANELIST THERE. OF FOR BEARING WITH US ON THIS AND OBVIOUSLY WE HOPE THIS WILL BE A CONTINUED CONVERSATION IN THE NEXT FOUR MONTHS. AMAZINGLY AS WE MOVE TO ISSUE FOR WE HAVE EXACTLY THE SAME PANEL. AND THE SUBJECT IS THE PART TIME FACULTY. A HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. AND WE WILL GO N THE SAME ORDERS BEFORE MOST START WITH STANDOUT. HANNAH WERE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ALTHOUGH BY THE TIME WE GET DONE WITH THIS HEARING YOU MAY BE AS OLD AS I WAS DESCRIBING AND THE LAST I. BUT THEN I WILL I WILL TRY TO KEEP MY COMMENTS BRIEF- AGAIN DAN HAD OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- IN THE GOVERNOR'S VETO MESSAGE FOR EIGHTY THREE SEVENTY FIVE. HE COMMITTED TO CONSIDERING OPTIONS TO BETTER SUPPORT PART TIME FACULTY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. MINISTRATION PROPOSES TO FULFILL THAT COMMITMENT WITH THE INVESTMENT OF TWO HUNDRED MILLION ONGOING PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. INTO THE PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM. THE ADMINISTRATION EXPECTS THAT THIS INVESTMENT PROVIDED STRONG FISCAL INCENTIVES. FOR DISTRICTS OFFER HEALTH INSURANCE TO MORE OF THE PART TIME FACULTY. FOSTER PROVIDING LOCAL CONTROL AND FLEXIBILITY ON THE PETITION. WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS INVESTMENT THANK YOU VERY MUCH LMAO. THANK YOU CARE LAYERED. THIS IS REALLY AN ISSUE WE THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS MORE INFORMATION ON TO MAKE A DECISION AS YOUR AGENDA NOTES THE GOVERNOR WOULD LIKE TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO PART TIME FACULTY IN PART TIME FACULTY ARE CRITICAL PART OF THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND STATE CERTAINLY HAS AN INTEREST IN MAKING SURE YOU'RE TAKING CARE OF. YET THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE SOME BASIC INFORMATION IT REALLY NEEDS LEGISLATURE DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY PART TIME FACULTY ALREADY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND WHERE THEY GET THAT COVERAGE FROM THE LEGISLATURE ALSO DOESN'T KNOW HOW MANY LACK. HEALTH CARE INSURANCE DESPITE THE STATE'S REQUIREMENTS FOR CALIFORNIANS TO HAVE ADEQUATE HEALTHCARE COVERAGE SO WITHOUT THIS INFORMATION IT'S REALLY NOT POSSIBLE FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO DETERMINE IF THERE'S A PROBLEM AND HOW WIDESPREAD THAT PROBLEM MIGHT BE. THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOTE THAT A NUMBER OF DISTRICTS DO OFFER HEALTH CARE TO PART TIME FACULTY BUT THE LEGISLATURE HAS LIMITED INFORMATION ON THE EXTENT OF THAT COVERAGE AND THE COST THAT EMPLOYEES MUST BEAR AND WHETHER SOME PART TIME FACULTY MIGHT HAVE BEEN BETTER OFF GETTING COVERAGE THROUGH COVERED CALIFORNIA INSTEAD WHICH PROVIDE SUBSIDIES FOR MONEY CALIFORNIANS. SO THE GOVERNOR'S APPROACH TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO PART TIME FACULTY THROUGH DISTRICT. SPONSORED COVERAGE- I CAN UNDERSTAND WHERE HE'S COMING FROM THERE BUT YET THE THERE'S AN ISSUE ABOUT PART TIME FACULTY THEY'RE CONSIDERED TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES OF THE DISTRICT. AND THEY MAY NOT BE RETAIN FROM ONE YEAR TO THE NEXT OR EVEN ONE SEMESTER TO THE NEXT SO EVEN IF THE DISTRICT. WERE TO OFFER A ROBUST COVERAGE TO PART TIME FACULTY THE LEGISLATURE FACES AS PART OF A LARGER POLICY QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PROGRAM IS THE BEST WAY TO PROVIDE THEM WITH HEALTH INSURANCE. I WOULD MANY INSTRUCTORS POTENTIALLY GETTING ON THE DISTRICT COVERED ALL HEALTH INSURANCE WHEN THEY'RE WORKING ON THEIR TEACHING AND THEN OFF WHEN THEY ARE NOT OFFERED. OF COURSE TO TEACH. AND OF COURSE THERE'S THIS ISSUE ABOUT WHAT ABOUT OTHER PART TIME EMPLOYEES WORKING IN THE STATE BEYOND JUST CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY COLLEGE A PART TIME FACULTY. SO WE RECOMMEND THE DIRECTIVE MEANT WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO GET MORE INFORMATION ON THE INSURANCE STATUS OF PART TIME FACULTY AND ON ART TIME FACULTY HEALTH CARE PLANS THAT ARE OFFERED BY DISTRICTS CURRENTLY. I KNOW THE CALIFORNIA FEDERATION OF TEACHERS HAS DONE SOME WORK IN THAT AREA- ALREADY- WE ALSO RECOMMENDS THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT ADMINISTRATION TO WORK WITH OTHER STATE AGENCIES- TO GATHER INFORMATION. ON PART TIME WORKERS IN THE STATE. THAT WILL GIVE A- MORE FOR. LEGISLATURE GAS THE SHOULD BACK IN THE FALL FALL TWO TO SUBMIT THE- AND THAT WILL GIVE INFORMATION. TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND THE LEGISLATURE TO MAKE AN INFORMED DECISION ABOUT THIS ISSUE. FOR NEXT YEAR POTENTIAL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND WILL MOVE TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WE ARE VERY GLAD TO SEE IN A ROBUST INVESTMENT IN PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH. IF YOU MAY RECALL THIS PROGRAM WAS FUNDED AT FOUR HUNDRED AND NINETY THOUSAND DOLLARS- BOTH WOEFULLY UNDERFUNDED GIVEN THE NEED FOR ALL INDIVIDUALS HAVE ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE AND THE IMPORTANCE OF HEALTH CARE DURING THE TIME OF ENDEMIC. WE DO SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL WE DO THINK THERE ARE OPTIONS TO PROVIDE A HIGHER REIMBURSEMENT RATE FOR DISTRICTS SO THAT THERE IS A GREATER INCENTIVE TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE ARE TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THAT SMALL FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND PROGRAM BUT WITH ADDED RESOURCES WE THINK THAT MANY OTHERS CAN POTENTIALLY PARTICIPATE AND THEN CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEIR PART TIME FACULTY TO PROVIDE ACCESS TO QUALITY CARE. THANK YOU HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. AN ARMY SAY BEFORE I ANSWER QUESTIONS I STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS AND I THINK THAT THE- THE QUESTIONS ARE ABOUT TO ASK ARE REALLY DESIGNED MORE TO FIND OUT. IF THERE'S A WAY TO GET TO THE BEST ADVANTAGE OF THE COLLEGE DISTRICTS AND THE PART TIME FACULTY AND WHAT THEIR COMPENSATION IS AND HOW TO GET THERE AND SO. I WAS GONNA S. FINANCE FIRST FROM WHAT THE ANALYTICAL BASIS WAS FOR THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS- A NUMBER THAT'S IN THE BUDGET TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. SURE SO THE TWO HUNDRED MILLION I THINK I THINK REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S- INTEREST IN AND REALLY PROVIDING A STRONG FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR DISTRICTS TO PROVIDE. RATED LEVELS O HEALTH INSURANCE TO THEIR PART TIME FACULTY- WHILE ALSO BALANCING THAT NEED WITHIN OF THE AVAILABLE RESOURCES UNDERNEATH THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE SO I THINK IN TEN TERMS OF WHY SPECIFICALLY TWO HUNDRED NINE IT'S- IT'S REALLY THOSE TWO FACTORS BALANCED OF. AVAILABLE RESOURCES AVAILABLE ON GOING RESOURCES UNDER THE NINETY GUARANTEE- BOUNCED AGAINST I GUESS WHAT I WAS CONCERNED ABOUT IS DO YOU KNOW HOW MANY PART TIME FACULTY DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE HOW MUCH IT'LL COST AND WHETHER THIS IS AN ADEQUATE NUMBER- I WOULD HAVE TO DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUES. FROM THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IN TERMS OF MORE INFORMATION ON THE SPECIFIC NUMBER OF PART TIME FACULTY WHO WHO CURRENTLY DO NOT HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE- AGAIN I MEAN I THINK THIS PROPOSAL IS REALLY DESIGNED TO SIGNAL THE- ADMINISTRATION'S STRONG. INTEREST IN PROVIDING GREATER LEVELS OF PART TIME FACULTY HEALTH INSURANCE- THE TO THE- ENTER ENTER IS A PROGRAM DESIGNED IN IMPACTED THIS PROPOSAL I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT WE'RE- CONTINUING TO- TRY TO LEARN MORE ABOUT IN CONVERSATIONS WITH STAKEHOLDERS- AS WELL AS OUR ARE PARTNERS IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AND. PRETTY SIGNIFICANT NEW INVESTMENTS- IN THIS PROGRAM THAT'S CURRENTLY FUNDED AT ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED NINETY THOUSAND. DOLLARS AN ONGOING BASIS AND SO I THINK THERE'S GOING TO BE- A LOT MORE THAT WE'RE LEARNING ABOUT THIS- BASED BASED ON THIS THAT THE LEVEL OF BUSINESS INVESTMENT AND THEN LET ME ASK THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IF SHE COULD REFLECT ON THE QUESTION. YES HAPPY TO REFLECT ON THAT QUESTION BECAUSE WE DON'T HAVE ALL DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING IN THE PROGRAM GIVEN THAT ON AVERAGE THEY GET CENTS ON THE DOLLAR FOR PARTICIPATION BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS SO LOW FUNDED- WE KNOW THAT THREE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED NINETY FIVE FACULTY PARTICIPATE IN THE CURRENT PROGRAM WHAT WE DON'T KNOW. IS HOW MANY INDIVIDUALS PARTICIPATE AND OTHER HEALTH- RECEIVE HEALTHCARE THROUGH OTHER MEANS EITHER THROUGH HEALTH PROGRAM THAT IS PROVIDED BY THE DISTRICT BUT THEY JUST DON'T APPLY FOR REIMBURSEMENT. OR AS THE SHARED THROUGH THE EXCHANGE WE KNOW THAT- MANY OF OUR FACULTY COLLEAGUES- GROUPS ARE SEEKING MISINFORMATION TO TRY TO GET THAT INFORMATION AND WE'LL LOOK TO- GAINING THAT WE ALSO THINK THAT GREATER PARTICIPATION IN THIS PROGRAM. WOULD GIVE US THAT DATA POINTS. K. TWELVE. BECAUSE I THINK OUR BOTH OF YOU VERY. SAID DON'T KNOW. THIS SIR IT BECAUSE YOU REALLY DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE ARE OUT THERE THAT NEED THIS AND WHAT THE COST IS. ONE ME ASK THERE'S THE THERE'S BEEN A DISCUSSION OF THE CURRENT PROGRAM AND HOW MUCH COAST THERE. WHAT WOULD THE OVERLAY OF THIS NEW AMOUNT TO THAT. WOULD THIS BE AN EXTENSION OF WHAT GOES TO THOSE COLLEGES TO EVERY OTHER COLLEGE WOULD IT BE MORE TO THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY PARTICIPATING AND THOSE THAT HAVEN'T. WHAT WOULD BE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE CURRENT PROGRAM AND WHAT IS CREATED BY THIS ALLOCATION. BUT A JUMP IN SENATOR LAYERED. SO AS I MENTIONED WE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY ONE DISTRICTS AND ON THIS YEAR BUT THAT FLUCTUATES YEAR TO YEAR SO THIS YEAR WE ONLY ABOUT THIRTY ONE DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING. THE TOTAL PREMIUM COSTS WERE ON THIRTY ONE- POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS- AND THAT AGAIN IS- UP WITH ABOUT. LESS THAN A THIRD OF DISTRICTS PARTICIPATING AND SO WE DO THINK THAT WITH GREATER IN NUMBER OF DISTRICTS- ACTUALLY TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS ARE THEY TOTAL COSTS WOULD INCREASE WE ALSO. WOULD HOPING THAT THIS WOULD LEAD TO HIGHER QUALITY HEALTH BENEFITS- AND THEY WOULD BE- AGAIN THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE ELIGIBLE TO ANY DISTRICT THAT SEEKS REIMBURSEMENT. SO IT WOULD SUPPORT THOSE THAT ARE ALREADY PARTICIPATING AS WELL AS ANY NEW. DISTRICT I GET THAT BUT I CAN'T TELL IF IT SUPPORTS IN THE SAME WAY WOULD THEY BE GETTING MORE THE EXISTING DISTRICTS BECAUSE THERE'S ALLOCATION AND THEN THE LEVEL WOULD BE HIGHER FOR ALL DISTRICTS. IT IS THE PROPOSAL DETECTIVE PROGRAM THAT EXISTS FOR THE CURRENT DISTRICTS AND EXTENDED TO THE OTHER COLLEGE DISTRICTS. HOW IS THIS GOING TO WORK. SO THE PRO WILL. EXTEND TO- IT WOULD BE PROVIDED- GREATER RESOURCES TO ALL DISTRICTS THAT PARTICIPATE THOSE THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENACT SO THEY WOULD HAVE ACCESS TO GREATER RESOURCES. AS WELL AS ANY NEW DISTRICTS THAT DECIDE TO JOIN- WITH A INVESTMENT THAT IS BEFORE YOU. DISTRICTS COULD ALSO HAVE LOCAL CONVERSATIONS THAT HAPPEN AS PART OF THEIR LOCAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING IN THEIR LOCAL CONTROL- IT TO LOOK AT BETTER QUALITY HEALTH PROGRAMS. SO THERE ARE MANY IMPROVEMENTS THAT COULD HAPPEN AS PART OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS PROGRAM THEN OF WHAT ME JUST MAKE STATEMENT BECAUSE- EIGHT I REALLY THINK THAT THE BOTTOM LINE OF QUESTIONING IS WE REALLY DON'T KNOW. WE DON'T KNOW HOW MANY PEOPLE NEEDED WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE LEVEL WOULD BE. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT THE ON GOING COST WOULD BE WE DON'T KNOW IF IT'S ADEQUATE FOR MEETING THE NEED FOR THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE AND I THINK. AS WE HAD TO THE MAY REVISED WE WOULD LIKE TO KNOW THE ANSWERS TO ALL THOSE QUESTIONS BECAUSE IF THERE'S A QUESTION ABOUT PROVIDING AN ENTITLEMENT THAT AT SOME POINT WE CAN'T FIND. A HOME I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE COULD FIND IT SO I WOULD LIKE TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THAT DISCUSSION AS AS WE GO INTO THIS. AND SO I THINK THAT THE WAY I INTERPRET. THE GOVERNOR'S RECOMMENDATION IT'S TO THROW A NUMBER ON THE TABLE TO START THE DISCUSSION AND SO I'M JUST HOPING THERE'S A DISCUSSION THAT GETS US TO SOME DEFINITIVE ANSWERS TO THESE QUESTIONS BY THE TIME WE- GET TO THE MAKE REFUNDS SO LET ME JUST- ASK MY COLLEAGUES WE'VE BEEN JOINED BY SENATOR CHOI BOGUE LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES AND IT WAS. OUR QUICK COM FROM SAN MAN. I ALSO WANT TO ECHO- CENTER LETTERS COMMENTS WHILE I CERTAINLY RESPECT AND APPRECIATE THE TESTIMONY FROM- ALEJO OUT WE DO NEED MORE DATA ON EXACTLY WHAT THE COST OF THIS IS GOING TO BE I THINK AS A AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE- I THINK WE'VE TREATED OUR PART TIME INSTRUCTORS- INCREDIBLY POORLY AND- IT'S ABOUT TIME WE PROVIDED THEM WITH. HEALTHCARE WHICH AND I THINK IT'S A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT AND AS WE ALL AGREE ON IN CALIFORNIA SO- AS A MATTER OF PRINCIPLE I SUPPORT THIS OBVIOUSLY IT'S IMPORTANT UNDERSTAND WHAT THIS WILL COST US BUT- I HOPE WE GET TO THAT POINT SOONER RATHER THAN LATER. THANK YOU THE CENTER OF TROUBLES NO COMMENTS. OKAY THEN. LET ME- THANK THE PANEL. WHO AMAZINGLY IS NOT GOING VERY FAR AWAY. BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING TO ISSUE FIVE THE LOWER DIVISION A TRANSFER RELATED ISSUES. OF WE HAVE THE SAME- PANEL AND WE'LL START WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. BANDANNA WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE FOR THIS PANEL WILL DISCUSS THREE PROPOSALS THAT UTILIZE ONE TIME RESOURCES TO SIMPLIFY THE COLLEGE GOING AND TRANSFER EXPERIENCE FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES ONE HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND TO SUPPORT COME COURSE NUMBER. THIS INVESTMENT IS RELATED TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ASSEMBLY BILL ELEVEN ELEVEN AND BUILT ON THE INVESTMENT OF TEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. FOR THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A COMMON COURSE NUMBERING SYSTEM ACROSS THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES SIXTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. FOR COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT THE TRANSFER FORM PROVISIONS OF ASSEMBLY BILL NINE TWENTY EIGHT. AND FINALLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TWENTY FIVE MILLION ONE TIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO ASSIST COMMUNITY COLLEGES FOR THE PROCUREMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SOFTWARE THAT CLEARLY MAPS OUT INTERSEGMENT- CURRICULAR PATHWAYS. TO HELP STUDENTS CHOOSE THEIR PATHWAY WITH SO IT'D STREAMLINED TRANSFER BETWEEN SEGMENTS. AND REDUCE ACCESS UNITS TAKEN ON THE PATH 2 DEGREES OR PROGRAM COMPLETION. THESE THREE PROPOSALS WILL BUILD UPON ONGOING EFFORTS BY THE COLLEGES TO IMPLEMENT THE GUIDED PATHWAYS FRAMEWORK- HAPPILY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THESE INVESTMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR YOUR COMMENTS WILL GO TO THE- L. A. L. IF THE LEGISLATURE IS PROBABLY. PLEASED TO SEE. OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- THAT HAS FUNDING. TO IMPLEMENT LEGISLATION OF THE LEGISLATURE PASSED LAST YEAR. HAVING SAID THAT ONE OF OUR OFFICE HAS. SOME OF THE SAME QUESTIONS FOR THE MINISTRATION THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. AS WHAT'S IN YOUR AGENDA ON PAGES TWENTY SIX AND TWENTY SEVEN. WITH REGARD TO THE COMMON COURSE NUMBER RANGE. ISSUE THE PROPOSED AMOUNT IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HUNDRED FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME. IT'S MUCH HIGHER THAN THE COST ESTIMATE IDENTIFIED BY APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. FOR THAT LEGISLATION. REQUIRING COMMON COURSE NUMBER AND I WAS ASSEMBLY BILL. ELEVEN ELEVEN- ALSO THAT LEGISLATION THAT SAME LEGISLATION REQUIRES. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF COMMON COURSE NUMBER A TO BE BASED ON THE WORK. OF THE COMMON COURSE NUMBERING WITH. ADULTS FUNDED IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET IN MR HANNAH OR MENTION THAT WORKGROUP- THE. WORKGROUP- IS TO RECOMMEND. HOW TO GO ABOUT IMPLEMENTING COMMON COURSE NUMBER IF THE WORKERS ACTUALLY HASN'T MET YET OF OUR UNDERSTANDING IS IT'LL MEET SOMETIME IN THE NEXT MONTH OR SO THE MEETING FOR THE FIRST TIME. ALSO THAT THAT MAKES- IDENTIFYING A COST ESTIMATE EVEN MORE DIFFICULT ALSO LEGISLATURE MAY WANT TO ASK YOU MINISTRATION AND JOSH'S OFFICE OR HOW THEY WENT ABOUT DETERMINING. THAT THE COST OF THE FUNDING AMOUNTING PROPOSED FUNDING AMOUNT OF FOR THIS- CONCOURSE NUMBER INITIATIVE AND THEY DON'T AS WELL AS TO GET A STATUS UPDATE ON THE WORKGROUP AND WHEN IT'S- GOING TO START. AS WE UNDERSTAND IT THE- PROGRAM PATHWAYS MAPPING TECHNOLOGY THE MISTER HANOVER MENTIONS OF THAT WOULD BE A USER FRIENDLY WAY IT SOUNDS LIKE FOR JUST PRAYER STUDENTS TO SEE WHAT HUMANITY COLLEGE COURSES THEY SHOULD TAKE AND WHICH WATER. ARE THEY SHOULD TAKE IT. TO GET A DEGREE OR CERTIFICATE. YOU SUCH TECHNOLOGY MAY HAVE MERIT- BUT THAT YOU COLLEGES WILL SOON CHANGE THEIR COURSE NUMBER IN. THROUGH THE CONCOURSE NUMBER INITIATIVE I JUST MENTIONED- IT MIGHT BE PREMATURE TO- CREATE AND ROLL OUT THIS NEW TECHNOLOGY GIVEN THE NUMBER'S GONNA CHANGE WITHIN A YEAR OR TWO. LASTLY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET A PROVIDE SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLARS ONE TIME EMPLOYMENT ASSEMBLY BILL NINE TWENTY EIGHT I TRANSFER PATHWAYS MR HANNAH WERE MENTIONED. AS YOU GENDER DENOTES THE CHANCES OFFICE. ESTIMATES HAD ESTIMATED IMPLEMENTATION COSTS MORE THAN TWICE THAT AMOUNT WELL THEY HAD DONE IDENTIFIED ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS FOR THAT LEGISLATION WHEN I WAS GOING THROUGH THE LEGISLATIVE PROCESS A LEGISLATURE. MAY WANT THE ADMINISTRATION CHAO'S OFFICE TO EXPLAIN THAT DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST ESTIMATE WHAT'S PROVIDED. YOU CAN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE YOU SENATOR LAYERED WANTED REITERATE OUR SUPPORT FOR- THESE PROPOSALS I STAY ON HEALTHCARE COLLEGES IMPLEMENT EXISTING- STATUTORY PROVISIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE HAS PRIORITIZED THEY ALSO- FOCUS OUR EFFORTS ON MANY OF THE STRATEGIES THAT BOTH ARE INCORPORATED IN FUNDING WHICH ARE- ADVANCING STUDENT SUCCESS IN ADVANCING TRANSFER. ALL NOTE- A FEW UPDATES WITH REGARDS TO COMMON COURSE NUMBER RANGE OUR FOCUS- IN THE INITIAL MONTHS- OF THIS LEGISLATION SINCE WHAT WAS SIGNED- AND JUST IN THE FALL HAS BEEN TO REALLY GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS WHICH COLLEGES HAVE CONGRESS NUMBERING SYSTEMS WHAT PROCESS DID THEY UNDERTAKE HOW DID THEY ENGAGE FACULTY THAT DO HAVE PURVIEW OVER THE CLASSROOMS. AND ALSO GAIN AN UNDERSTANDING OF OTHER STATES THAT HAVE COMPLETED AND DONE THIS WORK SO THAT WE CAN LEARN AND PREVENT ANY PITFALLS THAT MAY HAVE THEY THEY MAY HAVE UNDERGONE SO THOSE ARE THE FIRST STEPS AS WE SHARED- THE WORKER WILL CONVENE AND THIS SPRING- AND- WILL BEGIN ITS PROCESS TO INTEGRATE THE CONCOURSE NUMBERING ADOPTION AND MAY USE SOME OF THE- PREVIOUS EFFORTS THAT HAVE. OCCURRED UNDER THE I SEE IDEA EFFORT THEY- COMMENT IDENTIFICATION- SO THOSE ARE SOME OF THE KEY UPDATES WITH REGARDS TO TRANSFER REFORM OUT WE ARE LOOKING- TO ENGAGE IN THAT EFFORT IN THE FIRST YEAR THAT THEY CAN BE COLLEGES WILL CHAIR THAT STRATEGY IT IS BEING OVERSEEN BY THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE RESEARCH AND PLANNING AND SO WE'RE WAITING FOR THAT. GROUP TO BE CONVENE AND WE WILL BE HAPPY TO PARTICIPATE I'M HAPPY. TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU THANK YOU'RE VERY MUCH MY ME ASK CAR. FIRST THIS TIME THEY HAVE BEEN A QUEST. NONE FROM SAN MAN AND IF CENTER- TROUBLE. NUMBER FIVE. YES A- I'M IT ISN'T CLEAR THE ADDITIONAL MONEY THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET IS PROPOSING WILL ADDRESS HIM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES CONFIRM THE NEED FOR THE ADDITIONAL MONEY AND DO WE KNOW WHAT THE TOTAL SCOPE OF THE NEED IS. THANK YOU SENATOR HOW DO YOU ADDRESS ME FIRST TALK ABOUT TRAINS WERE REFORM. WHEN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE PROVIDED AN ESTIMATED TALKED ABOUT THE- IMPORTANT- BUT LARGE UNDERTAKING THAT THIS WOULD ENTAIL. AND SO- RESOURCES WERE NOT INITIALLY PROVIDED FOUR TRANSFER REFORM WHEN THE LEGISLATION WHICH WAS PASSED SO WE DO BELIEVE. THAT THIS INVESTMENT PROVIDES SOME OF THOSE RESOURCES RECOGNIZING THAT IT REQUIRES SOME STATE LEVEL WORK TO CONVENE GROUPS TO CONVENE OUR COLLEAGUES AT UC AND CSU WHO ULTIMATELY HAVE TO ACCEPT THEIR DEGREES. IT ALSO AT THE STATE LEVEL ALLOWS US TO START THINKING ABOUT AND- IDENTIFYING WAYS TO COLLECT DATA. THAT WE DO NOT HAVE THAT WILL HELP- ADDRESS SOME OF THE DELIVERABLES IN THE LEGISLATION AT THE STATE LEVEL ARE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IT ALLOWS AND DISTRICTS TO ADAPT TO THEIR SYSTEMS. TO CHANGES- AND TRANSFER- TO MODIFY ANY EXISTING EMILY HUGHES WITH PUBLIC TRANSPARENCY TRADITIONS AS WELL AS CONVENE FACULTY GROUPS. AND PROVIDE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT. SO DO WE HAVE- DO WE HAVE AN AMOUNT OF MONEY THAT WE KNOW OR WE CAN ESTIMATE THERE WILL BE NEEDING FOR THIS. COVER THE SCOPE OF WORK. OR TRAINS FOR WE INITIALLY AND- ESTIMATED- THAT IT WOULD COST ABOUT- JUST AROUND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY MILLION- WE DO THINK THAT THIS WORK WOULD HAPPEN IN TANDEM WITH THE INVESTMENT IN COMMON COURSE NUMBER RING IN OUR INITIAL ESTIMATE AROUND THAT HAD BEEN- JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER CAMPUS AND WE HAVE A HUNDRED AND SIXTEEN CAMPUSES. THAT WOULD MARK ON THIS WORK. THAT'S BEEN OUR OUR OUR ESTIMATE- FROM THE CONVERSATIONS FROM THE LEGISLATIVE FRONT WHEN IT WAS BEING CONSIDERED. SO THAT'S FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND PER CAMPUS. IS THAT CORRECT THAT'S CORRECT. OKAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THEN LET ME CLOSE WITH A QUESTION. TO FOLLOW UP ON OUR IT'S FOR FINANCE AND THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE MAY WISH TO COMMENT FOLLOWS UP ON OUR AGENDA AND COMMENTS OF THE OHIO THAT ON THE A. B. ELEVEN ELEVEN IMPLEMENTATION THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSES A HUNDRED AND FIVE MILLION BUT ASSEMBLY APPROPRIATIONS TAGGED IT WHEN IT WENT BY IT SIXTY MILLION. AND ON THAT A. B. NINE TWENTY EIGHT THERE WAS A SIMILAR. DISCREPANCY WHERE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET PROPOSED SIXTY FIVE MILLION BUT THE- COMMUNITY COLLEGE IN FINANCE ON ANALYSIS CITED THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- ACCOSTED HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION. AND SO- FOR FINANCE CAN YOU TALK ABOUT BY BOTH OF THOSE ESTIMATES ARE DIFFERENT- HAPPY TO- DANNY IN ORDER APARTMENT OF FINANCE- THE FIRST FOR AB ELEVEN ELEVEN D. MINISTRATION WORK FOR THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE TO DEVELOP ITS OWN COST ESTIMATE FOR AB ELEVEN ELEVEN- OUR ANALYSIS ARRIVED AT AN ESTIMATE OF ROUGHLY ONE MILLION PER CAMPUS AND SO. WHEN YOU TAKE THAT TOTAL AMOUNT OF ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN IN AND SUBTRACT OUT TEN MILLION- THAT WAS RIGHT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT- THAT THAT'S SORT OF HOW WE ARRIVED AT OUR- AT OUR BUDGET DOES A STICK FIGURE. MOVING TO EIGHTEEN TWENTY EIGHT- D. R. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. REFLECTS THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INVESTMENT REFLECTS THE ADMINISTRATION'S INTENT THAT. EXISTING RESOURCES IN THE- COUNSELING AND MARKETING- SIDE OF CAMPUS IS BE USED TO COVER COSTS RELATED TO THAT AND- AND ESPECIALLY THOSE ACTIVITIES ARE NOT SPECIFICALLY REQUESTED BY OR REQUIRED BY STATUTE. AND SO ONCE THOSE SPECIFIC COMPONENTS OF THE ECOSYSTEM IN A REMOVED YOU ARRIVED AT OUR OUR COST ESTIMATE SIXTY FIVE MILLION- AND OF COURSE WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF TO PROVIDE MORE DETAIL IN THIS. THANK YOU DISEASE BEFORE WE MOVE ON TO ZERO THE L. A. O. OR- CANCERS OFFICE HAVE A COMMENT ON THAT. LOOKING TO ADD CHAIRMAN LAYERED OKAY. I THINK THE L. ELSE SHAKING HIS HEAD BUT HE COULD BE LOOKING BACK AND FORTH TO TWO COMPUTER SCREENS. YEAH A COUPLE COUPLE COMMENTS- FIRST I THINK THAT'S THE FIRST OUR OFFICE HEARD ON THE SIXTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR REVISED ESTIMATE FOR THE TRANSFER REFORM BILL THAT AB NINE TWENTY EIGHT SO THAT WOULD BE INTERESTING- AND WE COULD- TAKE A LOOK AND SHARE WITH STAFF- ON ON THAT COST ESTIMATE THIS REVISED COST ESTIMATE FROM A HUNDRED THIRTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS ORIGINALLY DOWN TO SIXTY FIVE MILLION. OF WITH REGARD TO COMMON COURSE NUMBER IN THAT COST. STILL I DON'T THINK THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS MORE INFORMATION ON. BY THE- THE AMOUNT WAS ESTIMATED AT ABOUT FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER COLLEGE WILL BILLS GOING THROUGH LEGISLATIVE PROCESS AND NOW THAT AMOUNT IS JUMPED TO A MILLION DOLLARS FOR COLLEGE- BUT YOU THAT SAID THAT THE WORKGROUP BUT IN THIS NAVARETTE MENTIONED THERE ARE SOUNDS LIKE THEY'RE GOING TO BE STARTING TO WORK SOON SO THAT MIGHT. SHED SOME LIGHT ON ON WHAT THE COSTS WILL BE YOU KNOW BASED ON WHAT THE WORKGROUP RECOMMENDS WHAT THEY SEE AS AS THE BEST WAY FORWARD TO IMPLEMENT THIS LEGISLATION. THANK YOU N. N. AS A CLOSING COMMENT I WOULD JUST SAY I HOPE YOU ALL WILL WORK TOGETHER. ON THOSE NUMBERS AND JUST INFORM US AS WE HEAD TO THE MADE REVISED AND- IN WHAT YOU THINK SO THANK YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION. WE'RE GONNA MOVE ON TO ITEM NUMBER SIX STUDENT SUPPORT PROGRAMS INTERESTINGLY IT'S THE SAME PANEL. SO WHAT OF WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. AND OUR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE ADMINISTRATION RECOGNIZES THAT THE PANDEMIC IN ANSWERING RECESSION HAVE NOT IMPACTED ALL GROUPS EQUALLY. EVEN BEFORE THE PANDEMIC THREATS PERSISTENT LONG TERM EQUITY GAPS THAT EXISTED AND MOST IF NOT ALL OF OUR STATE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. AS SUCH THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES A SLATE OF NEW INVESTMENTS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGE STUDENTS AND WORK TOWARDS MEETING THE MULTI YEAR ROADMAP GOAL OF ELIMINATING EQUITY GAPS ACROSS THE SYSTEM. IN PARTICULAR THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET INCLUDES TEN MILLION ON GOING TO EXPAND THE NEXT UP PROGRAM. TEN MILLION ONGOING TO SUPPORT THE STABLE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EO PAST PRACTICES OR EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY SORRY BUT THE ACRONYM BEST PRACTICES TO DIVERSIFY COMMUNITY COLLEGE FACULTY STAFF AND ADMINISTRATORS. TWENTY MILLION ONE TIME TO SUPPORT EMERGENCY STUDENT FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE GRANTS TO ELIGIBLE AB FIVE FORTY STUDENTS- ONE POINT ONE MILLION ONGOING SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF. AMEND STUDENT CHARTERS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. AND ONE HUNDRED SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND ONE TIME TO SUPPORT A STUDY OF THE MUCH OF PROGRAM PRACTICES THAT PROMOTE STUDENT SUCCESS FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENTS. THE BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES THE COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS OR INCLUDES COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENTS TO PROGRAMS THAT EITHER STATUTORILY OR TYPICALLY RECEIVE ONE AND- WITH THAT I'M HAPPY TO ANSWER. ANY QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THESE INVESTMENTS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MOVE TO THE L. A. L. SO THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS IN THIS. AGENDA ITEM SO JUST A COUPLE COMMENTS NOW MAKE FIRST THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT HAVE MUCH INFORMATION SO FAR ON THAT AMEND. PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD BE A NEW A STATE FUNDED PROGRAM. LEGISLATURE WILL LIKELY WANT TO GET SOME BASIC INFORMATION ABOUT THE PROPOSAL WHAT WOULD BE THE ALLOWABLE USE OF THIS FUNDING FOR EXAMPLE. HOW THE PROPOSED AMOUNT OF ONE POINT ONE MILLION DOLLARS ON GOING WAS DETERMINED. HOW THE FUNDS WOULD BE ALLOCATED. TO OUR CAMPUSES. AND HOW THE PROPOSAL WOULD MEASURE SUCCESS ALSO HOW THIS PROPOSAL WOULD INTERACT WITH ANOTHER STATE FUNDED. PROGRAM FOCUSED ON AFRICAN AMERICAN STUDENT SUCCESS EMOJI WHICH WHICH MR HANNAH OR- MENTIONED. SO LEGISLATURE MAY WANT MY WANT TO DIRECT THE MINISTRATION AND JESS'S OFFICE TO PROVIDE THIS INFORMATION. AND USE IT TO HELP MAKE A. DECISION ON THE FINAL BUDGET- REGARD TO NEXT UP OF PROGRAM THAT THAT PROPOSE AUGMENTATION. THERE ARE DATA THAT SUGGESTS THE PROGRAM IS EFFECTIVE AT SUPPORTING ON FOSTER USE FORMER FOSTER YOUTH WHO ARE IN THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES WE DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE THAT YOU KNOW YOU ACTUALLY YOU ARE CHAIRED LAYERED AND IN CENTER MAN- AND OTHERS I HAVE CONCERNS WITH THE GOVERNOR PLACING A STATUTORY CAP. ON THE NUMBER OF PROGRAMS AND HAVING DISTRICTS SUPPLY AND SO WE'D BE HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF- TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS IN THE COMING MONTHS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WILL MOVE TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. THANK YOU CHAIRMAN LETTER TO MEMBERS OF THE ON BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE WHEN WE CAN BY HIGHLIGHTING ONE OF THE PROGRAMS- THAT'S NEW- HERE IN THE GOVERNOR'S INVESTMENTS AND THAT'S THE AND THEN- GRAHAM FOLLOWING THE MURDER OF GEORGE FLOYD- MANY OF OUR STATE LEADERS COLLEGE CAMPUSES STUDENTS JOINED. IN THE CALL TO ACTION TO REALLY FOCUS ON BLACK STUDENT SUCCESS ONE OF TWO GROUPS IN PARTICULAR HAVE REALLY UP IN THE MIDDLE AND LOCAL STRATEGIES TO HELP STUDENTS THE AMEND PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO SUPPORT BLACK MALE STUDENTS THAT HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATELY NORMALLY FACE IMPACTS- PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC BUT CONTINUE TO FACE AN EVEN NOW ISN'T SENIOR LOWER- RE ENROLLMENT FIVE BLACK STUDENTS. THE THIS PROGRAM WOULD REALLY PROVIDE GUIDANCE PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT AND NETWORKS OF SUPPORTERS STUDENTS TO BACK LOCAL CAMPUS STRATEGIES CAN REALLY FOCUS ON SUPPORTING BLACK STUDENT SUCCESS- AND THEN- THAT ACADEMIC PROGRAMS COULD ALSO A SUPPORT THEIR ENGAGEMENT AND LEARNING. CURRENTLY THERE ARE TWENTY FOUR PROGRAMS ACROSS THE SYSTEM THIS WOULD ENABLE- MORE PROGRAMS TO BE ESTABLISHED WITH THE GOAL OF ESTABLISHING AT LEAST FIFTY. AND THEN- OF GRANTS WILL BE PROVIDED- ANYWHERE FROM THIRTY THOUSAND ARE ESTIMATED THIRTY THOUSAND CAR ON CAMPUS- I ALSO WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE ALIGNMENT WITH THE MOTION MOTION WORKS BROADLY WITH A BLACK STUDENT SUCCESS HAS A LONGSTANDING HISTORY AND SUCCESS AND ALSO HELPING DEVELOP. ACADEMIC CULTURES THAT SUPPORT BLACK STUDENTS SO WE'RE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF BOTH OF THESE INVESTMENTS I BELIEVE IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH WITH REGARDS TO NEXT UP WE'RE VERY GLAD TO SEE A CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW WE CAN EXPAND THESE EFFORTS WERE ALSO- GLAD TO BE WORKING WITH- AS CHAIRMAN YOUR- YOUR T. AS WELL. ON HOW CAN SO OF THE GRAY. IDEAS THAT HAVE BEEN HIGH- IN THE THAT IT. EITHER WAY WE THINK THAT CONVERSATION ON HOW WE SERVE OUR STUDENTS KEY AS WE PROJECT- OVER FOUR THOUSAND- STUDENTS ARE CURRENTLY SIR BUT THERE ARE MORE THAN TEN THOUSAND STUDENTS THAT ARE NOT BEING SERVED- BELIEVE THAT IT'S THE RIGHT APPROACH TO IDENTIFY WAYS TO EXPAND SERVICES TO THEM. HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH TO THE PANELISTS AND- LAWMAKER. AND THEN ASK A QUESTION AND A COMMENT IS THAT. I'M SURE SOME PEOPLEHERE THE REFERENCES THAT SEEM SOMEWHAT CRYPTIC TO THE NEXT STEP PROGRAM AND MY EFFORTS AND- FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO DON'T KNOW THE NEXT A PROGRAM REALLY DELIVER SERVICES TO FOSTER KIDS. THE IT IN COMMUNITY COLLEGES BUT IT HAS BEEN LIMITED TO TWENTY CAMPUSES AND SURVIVE INTRODUCED. SENATE BILL EIGHT EIGHT FIVE WHICH WOULD REMOVE THE TWENTY CAMPUS LIMIT AND SO I SALUTE THE TEN MILLION EXTRA DOLLARS THAT'S PUT HERE. I THINK THE NEED IS PROBABLY WILL GREATER. AND WOULDN'T BE UNHAPPY TO SEE A LARGER NUMBER IN THE MAY REVISED TO DEAL WITH THIS BECAUSE I THINK OF IT THIS PROGRAM'S BEEN UNIVERSALLY ACCLAIMED AND IT'S REALLY. ADDRESSING SOMETHING THAT WE ALL SUPPORT. MY QUESTION. A IS A QUESTION FROM LAST YEAR AND THAT IS IT I NOTICED A LITTLE OBLIQUE REFERENCE BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO. THE FACT THAT IN THE CATEGORICAL PROGRAMS THEY GET A CALL IF THEY HAVE HISTORICALLY GOTTEN A CO WELL TO PROGRAMS HAVE HISTORICALLY NOT GOT A COURT. ONE WHICH IS THE POINT DAY PROGRAM. OUR AND MATH ENGINE AND SO HERE WE ARE AGAIN WHERE THEY'RE NOT GETTING CALL WAS AND IT'S LIKE I THINK WE'VE LAST YEAR EXPRESSED OUR INTEREST. IN THEM GETTING COLE WAS AND IT JUST SEEMS NOT FAIR THAT THEY BE SINGLED OUT TO NOT GET COURSES AT THE ANSWER IS IT'S BECAUSE IT'S HISTORIC THE HISTORIC WE'VE BEEN STARVED BY THE COST OF LIVING EVERY YEAR AND THEY PROVIDE REALLY VALUABLE SERVICES. M. WE WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT AND I GUESS I WAS GONNA MAKE THAT A QUESTION BUT I'LL JUST MAKE THAT A STATEMENT SO I HOPE. WHEN YOU HAVE THE EXTENSIVE DELIBERATIONS IN THE MAY REVISED YEAH I HAD THE CALL WAS IT FOR EVERYBODY NOT JUST. OF THE OTHER ONES SO M. S. MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS NON FROM SENATOR MEN NON FROM SENATOR TROUBLES. SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH ARM WE'RE GOING TO MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER SEVEN. OF FACILITIES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- AND AS I KEEP SAYING AMAZINGLY IT'S THE SAME PANEL SO ARE WE WILL BEGIN WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE- ISSUE. SEVEN FACILITIES AND DEFERRED MAINTENANCE. AT THE END APARTMENT FINANCE AGAIN- TO GO BUDGET INCLUDES OBLIGATION BOND FUNDING OF THREE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION ONE TIME FOR THE CONSTRUCTION PHASE THE SEVENTEEN PROJECTS AND DISSIPATED TO COMPLETE THE SIGNED BY SPRING TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AND THE WORKING DRAWINGS PHASE ONE PROJECT. THIS ALLOCATION REPRESENTS THE NEXT INSTALLMENT OF THE TWO BILLION AVAILABLE TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNDER PROPOSITION FIFTY ONE. THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET ALSO INCLUDES THREE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY SEVEN POINT SIX MILLION ONETIME PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND. TO SUPPORT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROJECTS AT THE CAMPUSES. THIS FUNDING WILL BUILD ON THE FIVE HUNDRED ELEVEN MILLION INCLUDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET ACT. THE FURTHER ADDRESS THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES. WITH AN AVID ANSWER QUESTIONS YOU MAY HAVE ABOUT THIS INVESTMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE L. L. BRIEFLY IT IS CURRY GENE TO SEE THE- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG GO DOWN- AS THE YEAR GENDER NOTES. NO THAT'S AS A RESULT OF THAT INVESTMENT IN THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO BUDGET OFFICE MISTER HANOVER. I JUST MENTIONED- WE THINK DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS A GOOD USE OF ONE TIME MONEY. AND WE RECOMMEND THE LEGISLATURE PROVIDE AT LEAST. THAT AMOUNT IN THE TWENTY TO TWENTY THREE BUDGET AND IF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT MINIMUM GUARANTEE COMES IN HIGHER THAN A REVISION LEGISLATURE COULD. CONSIDER PROVIDING EVEN MORE FUNDING. SO WE ALL ENCOURAGE RELIGIOUS TO DEVELOP A LONGER TERM STRATEGY FOR BOTH RETIRING. OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES DEFERRED MAINTENANCE BACKLOG AS WELL AS ENSURING THAT THE STATE AND DISTRICTS ARE SPENDING ENOUGH. TO PREVENT THE BACKLOG FROM GROWING BACK YOU BECAUSE EVERY YEAR YOU HAVE BUILDING SYSTEMS REACH THE END OF THEIR USEFUL LIFE SO THEY MIGHT NOT BE CONSIDERED DEFERRED MAINTENANCE RIGHT NOW BUT THE NEXT YEAR NEXT FIVE YEARS THE WILL BE. IT'S NOT ADDRESS SO THAT'S STRATEGY IS- WILL LIKELY REQUIRE OF PLANNING BEYOND THE TWENTY TWO TWENTY THREE BUDGET CYCLE BUT WE THINK IT'S A WORTHWHILE ENDEAVOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WILL MOVE TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. QUIPU AND SENATOR LARRY I'LL BE BRIEF AND JUST REITERATE THAT- OUR WERE ADDED CAN YOU COLLEGES TO- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS- AND BACKLOG IS ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS RIGHT NOW WOULD YOU THANK THE LEGISLATURE FOR MAKING AN INVESTMENT LAST YEAR THAT REALLY HELPED BRING THIS COST DOWN- COLLEGES CONTINUE TO INVEST ABOUT- 71% OF THEIR- THE FUNDS DISTRIBUTED WENT DIRECTLY TO IMMEDIATE- PHYSICAL PLANT- PROJECTS TO HELP BRING THIS DOWN. INSURE THE SAFETY OF FACILITIES- THIS WAS CRITICAL. SINCE THE YEAR BEFORE. DIFFER MAINTENANCE RESOURCES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED AND CREATED AN ADDITIONAL BACKLOG WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS A GREAT USE OF ONE TIME FUNDS ARE AND APPRECIATE THIS DISCUSSION HAPPY ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH- LET ME ASK MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE ANY QUESTIONS. I DID. WAS GO CENTER OTRO BOGAN THEN SENATOR MEANT. SO I'M ACTUALLY IMPRESSED WITH HOW YOU THE DIFFERENT MAJORS HOUSING GROWN EXPONENTIALLY AS WE'VE SEEN AND- AND AT OTHER UNIVERSITIES I'M CURIOUS TO KNOW HOW THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES- PROVIDE OR PRIORITIZE FUNDING TO ADDRESS THE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- I THINK YOU FOLKS HAVE A- OBVIOUSLY A DIFFERENT MODEL THAN ARE YOU SEASON RCS USE SOME KIND OF CURIOUS HOW IT IS. HOW IT'S POSSIBLE TO BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN THAT LEVEL. OF DEPARTMENT IS NOT HAVE IT GROW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I ONE HIGHLIGHT OF THE METHODOLOGY THAT WAS UTILIZED FOR RELEASING DEFERRED MAINTENANCE FUNDS THIS HERE- IN PRIOR YEARS WE RELEASED RESOURCES BASED ON THAT FTS OF THE DISTRICT THIS YEAR BECAUSE OUR IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCALYEAR. OR TWENTY TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR APOLOGIES BECAUSE THE OF THE ROBUST INVESTMENT WE WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE- A ONE MILLION DOLLAR BASE TO EACH DISTRICT ON THIS HELD- THOSE IN OUR RURAL. OR SMALLER DISTRICTS SOME SMALLER DISTRICTS IN COASTAL AREAS AS WELL THEY DON'T TYPICALLY HAVE THAT PURCHASING POWER THAT ALLOWS THEM TO KEEP THOSE DEFERRED MAINTENANCE COSTS DOWN INTO THAT METHODOLOGY REALLY ENABLED US. TO THEN- HAVE THAT TARGETED APPROACH WE ALSO HAVE A ROBUST- FACILITIES CONDITION INDEX THAT WE MAINTAIN FOR OUR FACILITIES THAT HELPS US UNDERSTAND WHERE THE NEEDS ARE- AND HOW TO PRIORITIZE THOSE. WITH SAFETY AT THE FOREFRONT. HELP THAT INTO YOUR QUESTION THANK YOU. VENTURA I'M I'M THINKING ACTUALLY IN PROCESSING THE INFORMATION SHE JUST SHARED BANKING ON PROCESS AND INFORMATION BECAUSE THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN IN OTHER COMMITTEES WE HAVE TO ANNOUNCE IT HERE. WELL I'M NOT I'M PROCESSING HER ANSWER. OKAY WELL WE'LL GO TO SENATOR MEN AND IF YOU'RE PROCESSING RESULTS IN ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS YOU LET ME KNOW SENATOR BEN- I APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE- AND I. I WOULD NOTE- THE GAP BETWEEN. DEFERRED MAINTENANCE THIS PROVIDED IN THE NEEDS WE CAN CUTS RIGHT RIGHT I THINK YOU JUST SAID WITH ONE POINT TWO BILLION IN OUR HAND OUT IT'S AT ONE POINT SIX BUT EITHER WAY THERE'S OBVIOUSLY A GAP BETWEEN THAT AND THE THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN. BILLION I'M SORRY THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION THAT IS PROVIDED I IN THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- MY QUESTION IS KIND OF TWO FOLD ONE WHY NOT PROVIDE MORE IN A YEAR WHEN- IT LOOKS TO BE A GOOD TIME TO INVEST IN DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND THIS IS A POINT I. HAD MADE OUR EARLIER UC AND CSU HEARINGS AS WELL- YOU KNOW WE WE'VE GOT A BUDGET SURPLUS- WE HAVE WE KNOW SIGNIFICANT BACKLOGS WHEN IT COMES TO DEFERRED MAINTENANCE AND INFRASTRUCTURE INVESTMENT. AND THESE TYPES OF INVESTMENTS DO NOT COUNT AGAINST AGAIN LIMIT. SO WHY NOT MORE AND THEN SECONDARILY- WHY ARE WE TAKING PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO DO THIS WHITE WHY NOT DROP FROM NON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO BEGAN LIMIT AND INSTEAD APPLY PROP NINETY FUNDING WHICH- IS EXAMPLE AGAIN LIMIT- IS THAT I GUESS THAT'S MY QUESTION- DID DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE YOU KNOW WHY DO WE STRUCTURE THIS IS PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING. AND WHY NOT DO MORE. I'M THIRTEEN HAMMERED APARTMENT OF FINANCE SO LOCAL ASSISTANCE FUNDING THAT IS PROVIDED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS. FALLS INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE- SO THAT'S WHY THIS INVESTMENT IS CODED AS IS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT- AND AGAIN THAT THAT THAT'S ALSO GOING TO AFFECT THE FIRST PART YOUR QUESTION IN THAT- THIS INVESTMENT IS. UTILIZING AVAILABLE RESOURCES INTO THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE BUT- IS ALSO BOUNCE OUT AGAINST SOMEBODY OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDED IN THE- THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET- TODAY AND FIT WITHIN THE PROPOSITION ID KESSENICH TRAINERS ARE YOU SAYING YOU CANNOT. USE NONPROFIT ANY FUNDING FOR THIS. AS IN THE ASSISTANCE DOLLARS THAT ARE PROVIDED TO DISTRICTS FALL UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE I DON'T SO IT'S RESPONSIVE THOUGH THANK YOU AND HAVE BEEN JUST COMMUNITY TO ANSWER ARE YOU SAYING YOU CANNOT USE NON PROP NINETY FUNDING. I'M I'M SAYING THAT THIS PROPOSAL UTILIZES PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDING TO INVEST. IN THAT'S MY QUESTION WHICH IS WHY IT WHY REASON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING INSTEAD OF NONPROFIT AND YOU FUNDING. BECAUSE WE KNOW THE PROP NINETY FUNDING IS EXEMPTION AGAIN LIMIT. NONPROFIT NINETY FINING GENERAL FUND. IS SUBJECT TO THE GAMUT AND SO GENERALLY SPEAKING IT'S IT WOULD SEEM LIKE A GOOD YEAR TO USE. GENERAL FUND NONPROFIT NDA FUNDING FOR ALL SORTS OF INFRASTRUCTURE. NEEDS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE NEEDS SO WHY DRAW DOWN FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING HERE WHICH COULD BE UTILIZED FOR A WHOLE BUNCH OF DIFFERENT PURPOSES INCLUDING I WOULD SAY THAT THE HEALTH INSURANCE THAT WE WERE TALKING ABOUT EARLIER. I INSTEAD USE PROP NINETY FUNDING EIGHT THAT WAS A CHOICE THAT WAS MADE IT SOUNDS LIKE AND I I'M CURIOUS WHAT MOTIVATED THAT DECISION. I'M AGAIN I FEEL LIKE- I CAN I CAN DEFER TO MY COLLEAGUE- MICHELIN. YEAH MISHANI WHEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SO QUALIFIED CAPITAL OUTLAY EXPENDITURES UNDER PROF NINETY EIGHT ARE CONSIDERED- YOU KNOW. SELL EXCLUDABLE UNDER THE GAS LIMIT- SO. YOU KNOW REGARDLESS OF WHETHER. AND SALAS NOT CELLS NOT THE FORMER DAHLE AT THE PLAGUE LAND TO THE STATE ALLOCATION LIMIT CORRECT YES MY THE FIRST TIME YOU CAN GO SELL NOW. A DID YOU COMPLETE YOUR COMMENTS YOU STILL GOING. YET I'LL JUST FINISH UP QUICKLY WHICH IS JUST THAT DEFERRED MAINTENANCE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S APPROPRIATED UNDER PROP NINETY EIGHT OR UNDER NON NAY NEED EXPENDITURES OR CAN BE EXCLUDED UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS LIMIT SO YOU KNOW THAT THE FACT THAT IT'S PROBABLY NEED DOESN'T HAVE ANY BEARING ON WHETHER OR NOT IT'S EXCLUDED OR NOT EXCLUDING. NO BUT I THINK I FIVE MY POINT IS THAT OKAY YOU'VE GOT A PROBLEM A BIG SILO PRIME NINETY FUNDING THAT CAN BE USED IT'S NOT NONE OF THAT SUBJECT AGAIN WHEN IT IS MY UNDERSTANDING RIGHT AND SO THAT COULD ALL BE USED FOR ANY PURPOSE RELATED TO CAPE ROUTE FOURTEEN. IF I CAN RESCUE OF FINANCE FOR SECOND- THE L. A. ALWAYS HAD HIS HAND UP FOR AWHILE AND I FEEL LIKE HE WANTS TO WADE INTO THIS QUESTION AND THEN A FINANCE WISHES. TO PASS ED THEY COULD. WELL IT'S JUST- CENTER MENU YOU MIGHT. HAVE A- FOLLOW UP ON THIS BUT- JUST TO REITERATE WHAT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE SAID THAT. UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR DEFERRED MAINTENANCE IS THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS THAT IS PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND AND IT WOULD BE EXCLUDED IT'S EXCLUDED EXCLUDED SPENDING UNDER THE STATE APPROPRIATIONS I MET YEP WORKS OUT NOW YOU CAN ABSOLUTELY LEGISLATURE HAS THE ABILITY IF IT WANTS TO USE NON PROPOSITION NINETY GENERAL FUND. FOR THESE KINDS OF PURPOSES AS WELL CAN BE REMAIN IN STORE FOR OUR FOR CONSTRUCTION SO YOU ACTUALLY DO HAVE THAT ABILITY AND I THINK MY THANK YOU FOR THAT HELPFUL EXPLANATION MR STENHOUSE AND I THINK MY POINT IS YOU'VE GOT PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING WHICH IS EXCLUDED UNDER THE GALLON IT BUT YOU ALSO HAVE GENERAL. FUND NONPROFIT NINETY EIGHT GENERAL FUND THAT COULD BE USED FOR THIS PURPOSE AND ALSO EXCLUDED- AND SO ANY IN A YEAR WHEN WE HAVE A BUNCH OF EDUCATION NEEDS. DRAWING FROM THE PROP NINETY EIGHT BUCKET MEANS THAT WE'RE NOT USING THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SOME ODD MILLION DOLLARS FOR pMIGHT DEEM APPROPRIATE- AND SO THAT SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN A CONSCIOUS CHOICE TO SAY WE'RE GONNA DROP THREE HUNDRED EIGHTY SEVEN MILLION DOLLARS FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT. WHEN WE COULD ALSO DRAW FROM THE GENERAL FUND AND THAT WOULD ALSO BE EXCLUDED FROM DOWN SO THAT THAT'S MY QUESTION BACK TO DEPARTMENT FINANCES WHAT WAS THE MOTIVATION- IF THERE WAS ANY- FOR CHOOSING TO USE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS AS. OPPOSED TO NON PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDS FOR THIS. SHANI AND APARTMENT FINANCE SO I'M NOT A AN EXPERT THE ON THE GAMBLING BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. PROP PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT IS NOT AUTOMATICALLY EXCLUDED FROM FROM THE GET LIMIT. RATHER YOU KNOW CERTAIN STATE SUBVENTIONS LIKE THE APPORTIONMENT I BELIEVE ARE EXCLUDED FROM AGAIN LIMIT AND- AND- QUALIFIED CAPITAL OUTLAY PROJECTS SUCH AS- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE GALLAGHER BUT THERE'S NOT A- RULE OF THUMB THAT PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT EXPENDITURES ARE EXCLUDED. FROM THE GALLON AT LEAST ONCE THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING. AND I THINK YOU KNOW TO YOUR OTHER POINT- DEFERRED MAINTENANCE HAS TRADITIONALLY BEEN. APPROPRIATED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES UNDER YET USING. PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT FUNDS AS MY- AS MY COLLEAGUE. YOU KNOW THERE IS A RATHER LARGE- INVESTMENT LAST YEAR UNDER PROPOSITION NINETY DOLLARS AND I THINK. YOU KNOW IT- ANOTHER CONSIDERATION IS THAT IF THERE ARE NON NINETY DOLLARS THAT ARE APPROPRIATED TO COMMUNITY COLLEGES- YOU KNOW OUTSIDE OF THE PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT GUARANTEE AND THEN THERE IS A RISK OF POTENTIALLY OVER APPROPRIATING. PROPOSITION AND EAKER T. I'D BE INTERESTED LA- THOUGHT ON THAT THOUGHTS ON THAT BUT I TAKE IT THAT THE ANSWER TO MY QUESTION IS THAT THIS. WEEK WITH THE QUESTION WAS WHY DO WE CHOOSE TO USE PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING AS OPPOSED TO NONPROFIT INDIAN FUNDING. AND I THINK THE ANSWER HEARD WAS. BECAUSE THAT'S TRADITIONALLY THE WAY WE'VE DONE IT- BUT I WOULD ALSO POINT OUT THE TRADITIONALLY WE'VE NOT RUN OVER THE GANN LIMIT. AND SO WE HAVE A AN INTERESTING. SITUATION AN OPPORTUNITY HERE. TO INVEST NINE NINETY EIGHT FUNDING IN A WAY THAT I THINK WOULD- ALLOWS HAVE A BIGGER POT FOR EDUCATIONAL NEEDS IN AND SINCE WE'RE SITTING IN BUDGET SUB ONE. I WOULD JUST EMPHASIZE THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF NEEDS THAT AS WE DISCUSS BEFORE UNLIKE OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE. ARE K. THROUGH TWELVE. AND SO YOU KNOW I PERHAPS IT'S WISE TO USE PROP NINETY FUNDING FOR THIS BUT BUT I HAVEN'T FELT LIKE THERE'S BEEN ANY KIND OF. RATIONALE GIVEN OTHER THAN THIS IS THE WAY WE'VE DONE THINGS AND THAT MAYBE THAT MIGHT WELL BE TRUE BUT BUT WE'RE WE ARE IN AN UNUSUAL TIME AD I JUST WANT TO KNOWLEDGE THAT. YEAH WE HAVE WE WAY OVER AGAIN LIMIT AND SO WE CAN TAKE THOSE DOLLARS FROM THE NONPROFIT NINETY FUNDING AND USES FOR THIS PURPOSE. AND I THINK HAVE UNLESS ELLIE- TELLS ME I'M WRONG HERE. I HAD WHAT WAS EXPLAINED TO ME IS THAT WE WOULD HAVE A BIGGER PART OF FUNDING UPFRONT NINETY EIGHT FOR SOME OF THE OTHER NEEDS. THAT WE'RE DISCUSSING INCLUDING THE HEALTH INSURANCE FOR PART TIME FACULTY AS WELL AS SOME OF THE OTHER- PRIORITIES THAT HAVE BEEN EMPHASIZED IN THE PREVIOUS ISSUE SO. I'LL JUST MAKE A GENERAL POINT- AND I ASKED EARLIER. IF YOU HAVE ANY. FURTHER COMMENTS ON THIS. YOU'RE JUST TO POINTS FIRST- OF. I THINK WHAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND SAY IS THAT. THESE PROJECTS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR FIND IT WOULD PROPOSITION NINETY EIGHT BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE. THAT'S HOW K. FOURTEEN EDUCATION IS PRIMARILY FUNDED A AND B. THE GUARANTEE IS GROWN A GREAT DEAL AND SO THERE IS MONEY- A LOT OF DETAIL ON A ONE TIME BASIS FOR THESE KINDS OF PROJECTS. THAT SAID I THINK CENTER REMEMBER WHAT YOUR THE FACT THAT. YOU'RE HAVING THESE CONVERSATIONS NOW IS REALLY IMPORTANT. BECAUSE THERE IS AN ISSUE OF EXCESS REVENUES- IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO- IT'S IT IT'S IN THE BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN EXCESS REVENUES. AND WE DO THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS NOW AND NOT WAIT UNTIL MAY REVISED TO START THOSE CONVERSATIONS HAVE THOSE CONVERSATIONS NOW DISCUSS WHAT OUR OPTIONS ARE WHAT'S THE BEST. WAY FORWARD TO TRY TO- ADDRESSES ISSUE OF- EXCESS REVENUES THANK YOU MISTER SHE HAS AN AND I JUST CLOSE BY SAYING- I'M NOT OPPOSE THE USE OF PROP NINETY EIGHT FUNDING FOR THIS PURPOSE- BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE MORE RATIONALE. AND EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE'RE MAKING THIS CHOICE BECAUSE IT IS A CHOICE WE'RE MAKING. AND WE ARE IN A UNIQUE POSITION WE HAVE A LARGE SURPLUS THIS YEAR AND WE'RE TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO DIVIDE THAT INTO DIFFERENT PRIORITIES- BY. CHOOSING TO BE USED AS PART NINETY FUNDING MEANS THAT WE'RE NECESSARILY TAKING AWAY PROP NINETY FUNDING FOR OTHER PURPOSES SO I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SEE MORE EXPLANATION FOR WHY WE HAVE MADE BY THE GOVERNMENT THAT CHOICE. AND WHY THE LEGISLATURE TO GO ALONG WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU AND LET ME JUST SAY IN CLOSING ON THE SIDE OF MY APPRECIATE QUESTIONS OF BOTH MY COLLEAGUES I THINK THEY REALLY. A HIGHLIGHTED IT AND I AGREE WITH THE SUGGESTION THAT WE SHOULD HAVE CONVERSATIONS OUT OF THIS BECAUSE- OF THERE'S A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT WAYS TO GO AND I WOULD JUST RENEW. MY COMMENT FROM A PREVIOUS ITEMS THAT I THINK HISTORICALLY PEOPLE THOUGHT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE DIFFERENT THAN CSU AND UC BECAUSE THEY HAVE LOCAL BONDING AUTHORITY BUT I THINK. OUR CHANGES TO MAKE THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES LESS COMMUNITY HAS LED TO LESS. APPROVAL OF THOSE BOND MEASURES AND SO I HOPE THAT THE DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD WILL LEAD TO SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES. ON THIS AS WE HEAD TOWARD THE MAY REVISE. OR WITH THAT WE'RE GOING TO MOVE. A TWO THE GLASS OF OUR AGE ISSUES AND WE- ARE. GOING TO MISS AND GET TO EXCUSE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND- THE L. A. OVER WHO'VE. WHO'VE BEEN VALUABLE IN OUR- OF FOR SEVEN ITEMS. AND OUR PANELIST IS DRESSED DR NAVARETTE FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SO WELCOME OF THIS IS. ISSUE EIGHT THE STUDENT HOUSING UP TO. THANK YOU SENATOR LEARNING THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF WHERE CALIFORNIA WE COLLEGES ARE IN STUDENT HOUSING. PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC APPROXIMATELY 60% OF COLLEGE STUDENTS FACE HOUSING INSECURITY PANDEMIC SURVEY ADMINISTERED BY OUR STUDENTS SENATE INDICATED THAT THE PANDEMIC EXACERBATED- BASIC NEEDS WITH 40% REPORTED INCOME LOSS LEADING TO AN INABILITY TO PAY FOR HOUSING EXPENSES. I SHARE THIS IS IMPORTANT CONTEXT IN THE WAY THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES ARE APPROACHING HOUSING WHICH IS VERY DISTINCT FROM- AND IN SOME WAYS DISTINCT FROM OUR FOUR YEAR PUBLIC PARTNERS THE KEY FOCUS OF EFFORTS AROUND HOUSING YOUR- FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES REALLY A BROWN FORD ABILITY. IN BEING ABLE TO OFFER LOW COST AFFORDABLE RENTS TO STUDENTS WHO ALREADY HAVE LIMITED ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID AND OTHER KEY SUPPORTS- ON THIS WITH THE GOAL. THAT IT SUPPORTS THEIR OVERALL EDUCATIONAL JOURNEY AND THEIR ABILITY TO SUCCEED WE ARE GRATEFUL TO SEE THIS HISTORIC INVESTMENTS THAT WAS INCLUDED IN TRAILER BILL SB ONE SIX NINE FOR CALTRAIN COLLEGES AS WELL. AS FOR YOUR PARTNERS WITH ONE BILLION OF THOSE FUNDS IDENTIFIED IN COMMITTED FOR COMING COLLEGES. AS A FORMER TRUSTEE CENTER WHERE YOU CAN LIKELY ATTEST THAT CALIFORNIA TO ME BECAUSE CHANCES OFFICE DOES NOT HAVE A CENTRAL ROLE IN STUDENT HOUSING. AND SO- AS THE LEGISLATURE PREPARES TO BEGIN REVIEWING APPLICATIONS THAT WERE SUBMITTED IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS WERE SUBMITTED INDIVIDUALLY BY DISTRICTS- WHO ARE INTERESTED IN HOUSING- FOR MANY OF THEM THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THEY'RE ENGAGING IN THESE CONVERSATIONS. NINETY FIVE APPLE ASIANS WERE SUBMITTED BY JUST RISK RE. FROM THE GRAMM PRO THAT THAT OF FINANCE IN THE LEGISLATURE WILL BE OVERSEEING. OF THOSE TWENTY FIVE APPLIED FOR CONSTRUCTION GRANTS FOR A TOTAL OF ONE POINT FIVE BILLION DOLLARS ALREADY EXCEEDING THE COMMITMENT- THAT IS MADE SB ONE SIX NINE FOR AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING. LET ME GIVE YOU SOME BRIEF CONTEXT OF WHAT CURRENTLY EXISTS ON BASED ON A GUN WE DON'T HAVE- WE DON'T COLLECT DATA SYSTEMICALLY ON THIS THAT WE DO HAVE AN INTEREST IN ESTABLISHING THAT ROLE. AS A SYSTEM ARE CURRENTLY HAVE IS CURRENTLY SYSTEM CURRENTLY HAS TWO THOUSAND TWO HUNDRED- AND- FIFTY STUDENT CAPACITY FOR HOUSING ONLY TWELVE ARE DISTRICTS. OFFER STUDENT HOUSING SOME MORE TRADITIONAL- RESIDENTIAL HALLS IS YOU MAY BE USED TO. OTHERS ARE- THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS FOR FAMILY HOUSING- GIVEN THE POST TRADITIONAL. COMPOSITION OF OUR STUDENTS. EIGHT OF THE STUDENT HOUSING COMPLEXES THAT WORK AND THAT ARE AT OUR COLLEGES WERE CONSTRUCTED OVER FORTY YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE LARGELY IN RURAL AREAS OR- BORDER AREAS OF THE STATE AND MAY BE ATTRACTING OTHER STUDENTS FROM. OTHER STATES. FRIEDMAN CALLING. DO NOT HAVE TO. STUDENT DATA THE WAY THAT THEY SUBMITTED AS PART OF CAPITAL OUTLAY- WHERE THEY INTEGRATE ON STUDENT HOUSING AS PART OF THEIR- EDUCATION PLAN FOR THEIR FACILITIES MASTER PLAN WE BELIEVE THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DEVELOP. A CRITICAL ROLE BOTH FOR THE LONG TERM AND SHORT TERM SUPPORT BETTER COLLEGES WILL BE NEEDING AS THEY ENGAGE IN HOUSING- WE ALSO IDENTIFIED A COUPLE OF AREAS- OF OPPORTUNITIES WANT TO MAXIMIZE THE RESOURCES IN THE HIGHER EDUCATION STUDENT HOUSING GRANT. I TO IDENTIFY ANY NECESSARY STATEWIDE STANDARDS AND REGULATIONS THAT CAN HELP. OUR COLLEGES DEAL WITH THE COMPLEXITIES THAT COME WITH- HAVING HOUSING ON THEIR CAMPUSES INCLUDING EMERGENCY RESPONSE- AMONGST OTHERS WE WANT TO MAXIMIZE FLEXIBILITY FOR LOCAL PLANNING AND DECISION MAKING BECAUSE LOCAL CONTEXT MATTERS IN MANY DISTRICTS WILL WANT TO SPECIALIZE THEIR HOUSING. TO TARGET KEY POPULATIONS THAT ARE AT GREATER RISK. WE ALSO WANT TO CREATE THE CONDITIONS THAT ENABLE- THE RECONDITIONING OF STUDENT CENTERED SUPPORTS IT ECOSYSTEM SO THAT WE'RE NOT JUST BUILDING HOUSING FOR THE SAKE OF HOUSING BUT IT'S TRULY CONNECTED WITH ACADEMIC PATHWAYS OR OTHER G. SUPPORT SUCH AS MENTAL HEALTH SUPPORTS. THAT STUDENTS MAY BE NEEDING. OUR ROLE IN THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE IS TO HAVE A DISCUSSION AROUND S. OR BOARD OF GOVERNORS HAS ESTABLISHED AND AFFORDABLE STUDENT HOUSING COSTS WORST- BY RESOLUTION AT ITS NOVEMBER MEETING. THEY'VE HELD ITS FIRST MEETING TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN BEST SUPPORT DISTRICTS THAT WANT TO ENGAGE IN HOUSING INCLUDING- THE CONSIDERING THE TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP. AND WHAT OTHER SUPPORTS THEY NEED. AS THEY APPLY FOR THESE GRANTS SO I HOPE THIS HELPS- OVERVIEW IS HELPFUL WEEK FROM I PROVIDED SOME FOLLOW UP MATERIALS AND TO- DR FRANCIS THAT CAN BE SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE. THAT SHOWS- SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE COLLECT FOR CAPITAL OUTLAYS WERE FACILITIES- THAT IS NOT COLLECTED WITH THE DIRECTION THAT WE REALLY WANT TO MOVE AND SO THAT WE CAN CONTINUE TO SUPPORT OUR DISTRICTS. ARE AND WE'VE ALSO PROVIDED AN EXAMPLE OF A. COLLEGE THAT DOES HAVE HOUSING SO YOU CAN GET A CONTACT OF THE ROLE. THAT IS PLAYING AGAIN I WANT TO AND- THAT OUR HOPE IS THAT- THIS SPRING AFFORDABILITY AT THE FOREFRONT TO OUR STUDENTS AND CONNECTION TO STUDENT SUCCESS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU ARMINA S. MY COLLEAGUES IF THEY HAVE QUESTIONS FIRST. JUST TO CHECK. ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM MY COLLEAGUES. I JUST HAVE TO THAT SENATOR MAN- I APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL HERE AND WE JUST SAY YOU KNOW I REPRESENT AN AREA WITH A NUMBER OF COME A COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND- WHEN I FIRST LEARNED ABOUT THE HOUSING AND FOOD INSECURITY THAT WAS PREVALENT IN THESE COMMUNITY COLLEGES IN ORANGE COUNTY OF ALL PLACES. I WAS REALLY SHOCKED. THIS IS A CRISIS- YEAH OBVIOUSLY IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO STUDY- TO ATTEND CLASSES IF YOU'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHERE YOU CAN SLEEP ON A GIVEN NIGHT SO I KNOW IN THE PAST WE'VE ALLOWED. WE'VE HAD PROPOSALS SOME OF WHICH ARE PASSED TO ALLOW FOR- PEOPLE TO SLEEP IN THEIR CARS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARKING LOTS AND THINGS OF THAT ATURE BUT BUT WE NEED TO ADDRESS THE CORE ISSUE HERE WHICH IS PROVIDING HOUSING FOR ME COLLEGE STUDENTS SO I THINK THIS IS A GOOD FIRST STEP BUT I WOULD EMPHASIZE IS JUST THE FIRST STEP AND WE REALLY NEED TO CARRY THROUGH HERE BECAUSE- THIS IS AN EXPRESSION OF OUR VALUES AS A STATE. ARE IN A DEFECTIVE WE HAVE STUDENTS IN COLLEGES- THAT ARE ESSENTIALLY HOMELESS IS IT'S JUST SHOCKING AND UNACCEPTABLE TO ME. THANK YOU ARM. CENTER OCHO ABOVE. YES I MY QUESTION IS THE FOLLOWING. WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES IF ANY HAVE THE CCC ENCOUNTERED SO FAR IN DEVELOPING ADDITIONAL STUDENT HOUSING WHAT IS YOUR BIGGEST OBSTACLE. OUR OBSTACLES. YEAH THANK YOU FOR RAISING THAT ISSUE THAT IT THAT IS ONE KEY AREA THAT- WE ARE FOCUSING ON- SO HOUSING IS NEW FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES AGAIN ONLY TWELVE- OF OUR IT DISTRICTS ACTUALLY HAVE IT. SO WHAT THEY ARE ENGAGING NOW IS IN INITIAL PLANNING THAT CONSIDERS- YOU KNOW WHAT ARE SOME OF THAT THE RISKS THAT ARE INVOLVED- AND HAVING STUDENTS ON THEIR CAMPUSES TWENTY FOUR SEVEN- HOW DO YOU PAY FOR. THE CONSTRUCTION AND THE LONG TERM MAINTENANCE OF HOUSING AND THEN WHAT SUPPORTS DO YOU PROVIDE STUDENTS SO THAT. THEY CAN BE SUCCESSFUL IN THAT HOUSING- AND THEN IN IN THEIR ACADEMICS THOSE ARE SOME OF THE CONSIDERATIONS THAT- ARE UNDER WAY INNER SENSUALLY NEW FOR MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS. AT THE STATEWIDE LEVEL AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES BUT OPPORTUNITIES AS WELL- AND- TO CONNECT- HOUSING- AND PROVIDE A STATE WIDE INFRASTRUCTURE FOR IT- WE WOULD FIRST BEGAN BY COLLECTING DATA ON FOR STUDENTS. AND STUDENT HOUSING AS PART OF OUR CAPITAL OUTLAY PROCESS BEFORE I DISTRICT CONSIDERS A NEW PROJECT THEY HAVE AN INITIAL PLAN PROPOSAL WHERE THEY THINK OF ALL THE CLASS RACE- HOW IT CONNECTS TO AN AD PLAN AND THEIR OVERALL FACILITIES. AND THEN THAT'S IT THAT IS- THERE'S TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO DISTRICTS ALONG THE WAY- BEFORE- BEFORE ANY OF THAT- INFORMATION AND THOSE PROPOSALS GO TO THE LEGISLATURE. THAT DOESN'T EXIST FOR HOUSING AND WE'RE LOOKING TO CREATE THAT SO THAT. ON WHO WOULD BE SERVED HOW THE WOULD BE SERVED THE COST PRO DAD- AND OTHER HE SUPPORTS THAT WOULD BE PROVIDED ALONG SIDE WITH THAT HOUSING THOSE ARE JUST SOME OF THE INITIAL AREAS THAT WE OBSERVE. OKAY SERVE I AM I GONNA INTERESTING I THINK YOU'RE ANYTHING ABOUT ONE. LAND OF PURCHASES OR CONSTRUCTION COSTS SO IT'S INTERESTING- THE COMMENT YOU JUST MADE THANK YOU THERE FOR I FOUND VERY HELPFUL. THANK YOU. SENATOR AND THEN LET ME JUST MAY BE CLOSE WITH OUR COMMON BECAUSE I THINK. A CENTER MEN OUTLINED THE ISSUE VERY WELL AND I APPRECIATED CENTRO CHAU BOOKS QUESTION AND I. I ALSO HEARD TO COMMENT DURING THE PRESENTATION ABOUT THAT I WOULD WELL KNOW THAT THEY BURKE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE DOESN'T PROVIDE THE INDIVIDUAL HOUSING BUT I ALSO WELL NO YOU COMPILE THE INFORMATION AND DIRECTED TO US FROM ALL THE DECENTRALIZED. CAMPUSES AND THAT IS AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN THIS IN AND AGREEING WITH SENATOR MAN. THAT'S MY EIGHT YEARS ON A COMMUNITY COLLEGE BOARD WHICH ENDED WHEN I CAME INTO THE LEGISLATURE TWENTY YEARS AGO. IT NEVER OCCURRED TO US THAT PEOPLE WOULD BE HOMELESS THIS WAS WHERE PEOPLE WERE LIVING WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND THE COMMUNITIES GENERALLY WHERE THEY WERE RAISED. HIM THE WHOLE NOTION THAT NOW I GO TO THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICT'S. CAMPUSES IN MY DISTRICT AND AMEND TOLD THE MUCH HIGHER PERCENT OF HOUSING IN SECURITY. IS SOMETHING THAT IS A CHANGE THAT IS DEVELOPED AND IT IT FITS WITH THE EARLIER DISCUSSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT WE CAN'T HAVE A THING IN THE FUNDING FORMULA ABOUT THE COST OF LIVING BECAUSE THE COST OF LIVING IS LEADING TO THAT IN SOME OF THESE. ARE AREAS AND AS A RESULT THIS IS NOT A USUAL THING FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DO THE- ONE CENTER ROAD SHOW ABOVE MENTIONED LAND AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS- I THINK THERE ARE MANY COMMUNITY COLLEGES THAT HAVE LAND I. VISITED QUEST NORTHERN ST LOUIS OBISPO COUNTY JUST TEN DAYS AGO. THEY HAD LAND THAT THAT THAT THEY COULD DO BUT THIS IS JUST NOT ANYTHING THAT HISTORICALLY HAS EVER BEEN DONE. OUT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW COLLEGES THAT I THINK ARE LARGELY RURAL AND HAVE PEOPLE COMING FROM WAY FAR AWAY AT THE TRIED. TO ACCOMMODATE IT AND SO. THIS IS NO. AND THIS IS NOT WHAT A LOT OF CA COLLEGES WAS OF THEIR- AND YET. I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SAID THEY WANT SUPPORTS. BUT THE BASIC NEED FOR HOUSING IS THE IMPORTANT THING AND I HOPE THE SUPPORTS DOESN'T TURN OUT TO BE A LIMITER IN SOME WAYS BECAUSE- EVEN THOUGH I WOULD LOVE TO SEE IT FOR EVERY STUDENT IS HOUSED. THE PRIORITY IS TO MAKE SURE THE HOUSING HAPPENED AND THIS IS. OUR THIRD HEARING FOR THE BRANCHES OF HIGHER EDUCATION WE HAVE HEARD FROM CSU. WE HAVE HEARD UC AND TODAY WE'RE HEARING COMMUNITY COLLEGES ALL THREE. ARE COMING- WERE APPROPRIATED OUT OF MONEY FROM THIS RIGHT FIRST ROUND OF. OF HOUSING MONEY THAT WAS IN THE BUDGET LAST YEAR MOST TO BE SPREAD OVER THREE YEARS. AND EVERY SINGLE SYSTEM IS HOPELESSLY OVER SUBSCRIBED IN WHAT THE DEMAND IS AGAINST WHAT WAS APPROPRIATED LAST YEAR SO I THINK THAT. EVEN THOUGH WE ARE- WHAT ARE THE L. A- WENT. AND FINANCE GO I JUST HOPE FINANCE HERE'S- THAT THIS IS STILL VERY MUCH A NEED AND WE ARE LOOKING FOR PLACES. WHERE THERE ARE ONE TIME EXPENDITURES THAT ARE RECURRING AND THIS WOULD BE ONE SO IF THERE IS AN ISSUE. OF FOR ADDING AND TRYING TO PICK IT UP THE SAME THING AS DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OF THIS IS NOT SOMETHING THAT A LOCAL BOND SHOULD BE REQUIRED TO DO SO. I JUST HOPE THAT THIS IS A GREAT START AND THEIR CONTINUED CONVERSATIONS ABOUT THE NEED THAT IS NOT BEING ADDRESSED AT THE THREE BRANCHES AS WE HEAD TO THE MAY REVERSE. ANY FINAL COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE OTHER CENTERS. R. I. C. THE HAND UP FROM THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE. WELL AS A SENATOR LARRY JUST WANTED TO PROVIDE ONE CLARIFICATION THAT- DAY GRANT PROGRAMS THAT- WAS ALLOCATED IN THE STATE BUDGET LAST YEAR. EACH DISTRICT HOW TO APPLY ON THEIR OWN THOSE APPLICATIONS DID NOT GO TO THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE THEY WENT DIRECTLY. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL ULTIMATELY BE- AND IN COLLABORATION WITH AND THE CURRENT FINANCE WILL DECIDE WHO RECEIVES THESE GRANTS ARE THE LEGISLATURE WILL ENGAGE IN THIS CONVERSATION. BEGINNING MARCH IS OUR UNDERSTANDING. AND WE WERE ABLE TO. ACCESS TO SOME OF THESE APPLICATIONS THANKS TO OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE LEGISLATURE SO WE APPRECIATE THAT GRAHAM. BUT WE DO WANT YOU TO BE PART OF THE CONVERSATION SO THANK YOU WE APPRECIATE THIS. END WE ARE NOW GOING TO MOVE TO PUBLIC COMMENT AND WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE MINUTES LEFT IN THIS HEARING. AND SO- ANYBODY THAT WANTS TO PARTICIPATE BY PHONE- IT'S AT. SEVEN THREE SIX. TWO EIGHT THREE THREE. AND I ASSUME THAT SOME POOR MODERATORS BEEN STANDING BY FOR SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THIS HEARING WAITING ON I AM AWARE THAT WE HAVE AT LEAST. TWO PEOPLE IN THE COMMITTEE ROOM BUT I AM TRYING TO ASSESS HOW MANY PEOPLE WANT TO SPEAK. TO BE ABLE TO HAVE A SENSE OF. OF WHETHER WE HAVE TO LIMIT OF THE TIMES THE MODERATOR WELCOME TO THE- COMMITTEE. THANK YOU AND MISTER CHAIR WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWENTY FOUR IN OUR COMMENT QUEUE OKAY AND THAT USUALLY DOUBLES SO. WHAT THATMEANS IS THAT I AM GOING TO HAVE TO SEVERELY LIMIT THE TESTIMONY. AND WE HAD TO DO THIS FOR THE UC HEARING. SO I THINK WHAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO DO. IS ASK PEOPLE TO SAY THEIR NAME THEIR ORGANIZATIONAL AFFILIATION AND ONE OR TWO SENTENCES ABOUT WHAT THEY SUPPORT WHETHER THEY SUPPORT. REFORMING THE SKIFF WHETHER THEY SUPPORT. OF STUDENTS SUPPORTS SUCH AS- ARE WE HEARD IN THE ONE ITEM WHETHER THEY SUPPORT THE ENROLLMENT GROWTH AND THEN ANYTHING ELSE THAT THEY WANT TO MAKE SURE THEY ARE WE KNOW THEY CAN WRITE US AND WE WILL INCLUDED IN THE RECORD SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO BE REALLY BRIEF- IN THE TESTIMONY TODAY. AND SO LET ME FIRST MODERATOR BEFORE I GO BACK TO YOU LET ME GO TO THE ROOM AND ASK IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE ROOM THAT WISHES TO TESTIFY. AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THE BREVITY SO IF YOU JUST YOUR NAME YOUR AFFILIATION AND WHAT YOU SUPPORT. SURE ENTER MARTINEZ WITH A COMMUNITY COLLEGE LEAGUE OF CALIFORNIA WE APPRECIATE THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET BUT WE WOULD ENCOURAGE INVESTMENT AND A COST OF LIVING ADJUSTMENT FOR THE NON ALLOCATE INCREASE JAPAN'S BECOME MORE AVAILABLE USUALLY RECOGNIZE THE PENSION OBLIGATIONS ARE SIGNIFICANT PART ACROSS THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
