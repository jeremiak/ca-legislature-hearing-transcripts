ITEM FIVE FLOOR ACKNOWLEDGMENTS IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE ITEM FIVE THROUGH TWELVE. I'D BE HAPPY AS I COLLEAGUES LOOK TO. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIRMAN MADAM SECRETARY WE CALL THE ROLL SENATORS BATES. BATES AYE MONNING MONNING AYE ROTH ROTH I WILL COMBINE WILK AYE ATKINS HI A CONCISE THANK YOU VERY MUCH COLLEAGUES AND WITH THAT WE WILL GO AHEAD AND CALL THE FIRST- OUR APPOINTMENT FORWARD MISS PATRICIA MONAGHAN MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENERGY COMMISSION. AND. ASK THAT I YOU TAKE YOUR A FEW MINUTES AND- OPENING COMMENTS IF YOU WANNA THANK ANYONE FOR JOINING YOU HERE TODAY AND THEN WE'LL GO RIGHT INTO QUESTIONS AND COMMENTS WELCOME THANK YOU WELL I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY FAMILY- WHICH IT'S A REAL PLEASURE TO HAVE MY FAMILY AT A WORK EVENTS WHICH IS SO RARE SO- MY HUSBAND LARRY MILLER WHO'S A PSYCHOLOGIST OF MY YOUNGER DAUGHTER NAOMI. HIS FAMILY FRIEND TRISTEN. AND THE MY OLDER DAUGHTER GILLIAN- AND IT REALLY IS A PLEASURE TO BE HERE TODAY AND- I'M LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR QUESTIONS AND OUR DISCUSSION- THANK YOU FOR GIVING ME A FEW MINUTES TO ADDRESS YOU BEFORE WE DIVE INTO THE DISCUSSION- I WANT TO SAY FIRST OFF THAT- YESTERDAY WAS THE INTERNATIONAL DAY OF WOMEN. AND GIRLS IN SCIENCE- SO I THINK IT'S A PARTICULARLY AUSPICIOUS DAY TO BE HAVING THIS HEARING- AND- I AM IN THE SIGNED TO SLOT AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AND I'M THE FIRST WOMAN SCIENTISTS IN HISTORY OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION. AND WITH MY APPOINTMENT IT'S THE FIRST TIME THERE HAS BEEN A MAJORITY OF WOMEN ON THE COMMISSION LEVEL AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION SO. A LOT OF REASONS I THINK FOR CELEBRATION- I THINK WE'RE ALL WORKING TOWARDS. HAVING GOVERNMENT REFLECT THE DIVERSITY OF OUR STATE AND IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION AT THE TIME IN OUR INTERNET. THREE SO I HAVE PRETTY MUCH MY- PROFESSIONAL. WORKING TO REDUCE HARMFUL AIR POLLUTION AND TO ACCELERATE A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY WITH A STRONG FOCUS ON TRANSPORTATION. MY PRIMARY GOAL AS A COMMISSIONER IS TO ADVANCE CLEAN SAFE AFFORDABLE ENERGY AS WE WORK TO MEET OUR STATE GOALS FOR CLIMATE AND CLEAN ENERGY. THIS INCLUDES HAVING 1100% CLEAN ELECTRICITY BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE AS MANDATED BY- SB ONE HUNDRED AS A LEAD AGENCY ELLIS ENERGY AGENCY THE ENERGY COMMISSION IS GOING TO PLAY A KEY ROLE IN COORDINATING WITH OTHER AGENCIES AND MAKING SURE WE HAVE THE ANALYTICAL UNDERPINNINGS TO BE ABLE TO REACH THAT GOAL AS I SAID. THIS IS TRANSPORTATION AND THAT IS REALLY WHAT DREW ME TO THIS THIS POSITION- AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW WE ARE- TRANSPORTATION IS THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION IN THE STATE. IT'S NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF TOXIC DIESEL POLLUTION IS THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE OF SMOG FORMING NITROGEN OXIDES. AND IT'S GOING THE WRONG DIRECTION SO IN TERMS OF OUR GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION WELL WE'VE CUT. ELECTRICITY MISSIONS ABOUT IN HALF OVER THE LAST TWO DECADES. WHAT WE'RE SEEING IS AN INCREASE IN TRANSPORTATION POLLUTION OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. AND THAT'S WORRISOME- AS THE POINT PERSON FOR THE COMMISSION FOR TRAIN ON THE COMMISSION FOR TRANSPORTATION MY GOAL IS TO HELP THE STATE REACH ITS GOALS FOR TRANSPORTATION INCLUDING HAVING ONE POINT FIVE MILLION ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. AND HAVING FIVE MILLION ON THE ROAD BY TWENTY THIRTY. OUR TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM IS IN THE MIDST OF WHAT DANCE FOR ONLY A UC DAVIS CALLS REVOLUTIONARY CHANGE BASICALLY THIS COMBINATION OF ELECTRIFICATION AUTOMATION AND MOBILITY AS A SERVICE. AND A LOT OF THE COMPANIES THAT ARE WORKING ON THESE TECHNOLOGIES ARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA CALIFORNIA IS BASICALLY THE NEW MICHIGAN WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT I WOULD CALL NEW MOBILITY. WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HARNESS THESE TECHNOLOGIES AND SOCIAL TRENDS FOR THE GOOD. AND THAT WE INCREASE MOBILITY FOR ALL. LOWER COSTS ESPECIALLY FOR DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN REACH OUR CLIMATE AND ENERGY GOALS. WE ALSO NEED TO DIVERSIFY OUR SUITE OF TRANSPORTATION FUELS BEYOND FOSSIL FUELS. TO INCLUDE LOW AND ZERO CARBON FUELS LIKE- WHY MENTION ELECTRICITY HYDROGEN. AND ALSO SUSTAINABLE BIOFUELS. LASTLY I WANT TO JUST EMPHASIZE I HAVE A DEEP COMMITMENT TO EQUITY AND TO MAKING SURE THAT NOBODY GETS LEFT BEHIND WHEN WE HARNESS THE THREE REVOLUTIONS IN THIS TRANSPORTATION WORLD. ARE I THINK WE HAVE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY BENEFITS- NOT JUST WEALTHY PEOPLE. SO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OPENING REMARKS A LOOK FORWARD TO OUR DISCUSSION. YOUR FAMILY SENATOR OFF YOU WANNA KICK US OFF. CERTAINLY THANK YOU MAYOR PRO TEM- COMMISSIONER A CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR EMPLOYMENT IN YOUR CONTINUED WILLINGNESS TO SERVE THANK YOU I'M- FROM INLAND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AND WE HAVE A GOOD NUMBER OF FOLKS FROM MEMBERS OF THE CALIFORNIA WHO COMMUTE LONG DISTANCES BECAUSE WE BUILD HOUSES OUT WHERE I AM AND UNFORTUNATELY THE JOBS TEND TO BE ON THE URBAN IN YOUR BEEN COASTAL AREAS. AND GIVEN THE. GIVEN THE I WOULD SAY DIFFICULTY ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING A CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR UP IN A BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN THE AFFORDABILITY OF VEHICLES- WHAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT EXISTS AT THE AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION FOR THE- DEVELOPMENT. OF HYDROGEN PASSENGER VEHICLES IS SUPPOSED TO HYDROGEN MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES. SO THERE ARE YOU PROBABLY DO KNOW THE SERVER BUT THERE THERE'S TWO TYPES OF ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES AND FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES ARE BOTH ELECTRIC I WOULD SAY. THEY BOTH HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY. AND WHILE BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES RIGHT NOW WE HAVE MANY MORE THAN NOT JUST IN CALIFORNIA BUT GLOBALLY. SO CALIFORNIA HAS OVER SIX HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES- LIGHT DUTY BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES WE ALSO HAVE ABOUT SEVEN THOUSAND LIGHT DUTY FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLES- CALIFORNIA'S LEADING. THE WORLD IN TERMS OF FUEL CELL ELECTRIC VEHICLE DEPLOYMENT. AND THERE ARE SOME ADVANTAGES TO FUEL CELLS BUT THERE ARE ALSO SOME BIG HURDLES THAT WERE WERE TRYING TO ADDRESS. THE ADVANTAGES ARE THAT YOU CAN HAVE QUICK REFUELLING BASICALLY THE SAME AS THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION VEHICLE AND YOU CAN GO LONG DISTANCES THE DISADVANTAGES WE DON'T HAVE OF. A ROBUST NETWORK THAT IS AS CONVENIENT AS YOUR BRIEF REFUELING STATION SO WE'RE BUILDING OUT THAT THEIR EDUCATION IS THE LEAD FOR BUILDING OUT HYDROGEN INFRASTRUCTURE. WE HAVE ABOUT FORTY FUEL CELL- HYDROGEN REFUELING STATIONS NOW IN THE STATE WE HAVE ABOUT SIXTY FIVE THAT ARE FUNDED AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO FUNDING UNTIL WE HAVE A HUNDRED STATIONS. OPERATIONAL IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I WILL SAY THAT ON HEAVY DUTY. I THINK IT'S PRETTY CLEAR THAT WE'RE GONNA NEED HEAVY DUTY FUEL CELL VEHICLES TO BE ABLE TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS- THERE CERTAIN DUTY CYCLES THAT ARE BETTER FOR FUEL CELLS. AND WE'RE SEEING SOME INVESTMENT IN THAT SPACE BUT NOT ENOUGH I'M I'M VERY COMMITTED TO- ENSURING THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE. ACTIVATING OTHER COUNTRIES TO FOLLOW SUIT WE CAN'T DO IT ALONE WE CAN'T BUILD GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAINS WITHOUT OTHER NATIONS REALLY STEPPING UP AND BRINGING DOWN THE PRICE OF FUEL CELLS. WE'RE ALREADY SEEING THE PRICE OF BATTERIES. CLIMATE PRESS THE BATTERIES IS GUNNED DOWN 90% IN THE LAST TEN YEARS IF IT CONTINUES IN THE NEXT FIVE TO TEN YEARS. THESE VEHICLES WILL BE CHEAPER TO OWN. TO CHEAPER TO BUY RATHER THERE ALREADY TWO FOR TWO FIVE FROM AN OPERATIONAL PERSPECTIVE HIS ELECTRICITY IS CHEAPER THAN. THAN GASOLINE. BUT I WOULD SAY YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CALIFORNIA FOSTER'S DE UM TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE ARE GOING TO NEED FOR THE FUTURE AND WE DO THIS IN A GLOBAL CONTEXT. AND IS DO YOUR COMMENTS ADDRESS BOTH THE COMMERCIAL USE. HYDROGEN OF HYDROGEN COMMERCIAL VEHICLES LIGHT MEDIUM OR HEAVY AS WELL AS PASSENGER VEHICLES. YEAH THE FOR THE INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING OUT HIS HISTORICALLY JUST BEEN FOR PASSENGER FEELS VEHICLES WITH EXT EXPANDED THIS YEAR. TO INCLUDE- HEAVY DUTY VEHICLES THEY ACTUALLY OF A DIFFERENT INFRASTRUCTURE THEY HAVE DIFFERENT FOR TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS AND ALSO AT IF YOU OWN. A PASSENGER VEHICLE YOU DON'T WANT TO BRIEF YOU DON'T WANNA REVEAL NEXT TO A BIG LIKE CLASS EIGHT TRUCK SO THERE'S SOME JUST PHYSICAL CONSTRAINTS TO HAVING THE TO- IN THE SAME LOCATION. BUT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE THINGS THAT WERE WORKING ON WE ARE DEFINITELY YOU KNOW OUR- GOAL IS TO USE OUR FUNDS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE TO. EXPAND OUT TO THE HEAVY MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY SECTOR WHERE WE REALLY SEE A NEED. THANK YOU THANK YOU MATTER TO MODE FOR THE MOVIE A CONFIRMATION. YOU THANK YOU BYE CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU AYE MAN PUT I A YES IN A CAN GROW ON APPOINT. WE HAD CONVERSATION ON THAT SIGN IS ONE OF TO TALK TO WHICH IS BUT THE MAYBE MAYBE TOUCH ON HOW. YOU SEE IS BEING ABLE TO BALANCE CONSERVING RESOURCES AND PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT WITH HAVING A SECURE RELIABLE MULTI FACETED ENERGY SOURCES JUST KIND OF MAYBE. YOUR VIEW ON HOW WE CHECK ALL THAT. YES WELL LET ME START IN THE TRANSPORTATION SPACE THAT I KNOW THE BEST IF YOU WANT WOULD LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE ELECTRICITY CITING HAPPY IT TO TALK ABOUT THAT AS WELL. SO AS WE INVEST IN CLEANER TRANSPORTATION AND AS WE THINK ABOUT HOW DO WE CAPITALIZE ON THE OPPORTUNITY TO- TO REDUCE COSTS. WE NEED TO REALLY THINK THROUGH- WITH BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES IN PARTICULAR HOW TO OPTIMIZE THE CONNECTION OF THESE VEHICLES TO THE GRID BECAUSE IF YOU. CHARGE VEHICLES AT THE RIGHT TIME OF DAY THEY PROVIDE A GREAT VALUE. IT ONE OF MY FAVORITE LITTLE DATA POINTS IS THAT WE COULD HAVE CHARGED EVERYONE OF OUR ELECTRIC VEHICLES EVERYONE OF OUR LIKE TO THE ELECTRIC VEHICLES. WITH THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY THAT WE CURTAILED IN THE MONTH OF MAY BECAUSE WE WERE GENERATING. RENEWABLE ENERGY AT A TIME WHEN WE COULDN'T USE AT ALL. SO IF WE HAVE THIS HAPPY MARRIAGE THAN WHAT IT RESULTS IN IS LOWER COSTS FOR EVERYBODY I THINK ELECTRIFICATION IN GENERAL THERE'S A LOT OF DATA THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT IF WE'RE SUCCESSFUL- EVERYBODY BENEFITS. BECAUSE THE VEHICLES AND THE FUELS ARE. GOING TO BE CHEAPER AND THAT MONEY STAYS HERE IN CALIFORNIA INSTEAD OF BEING SENT OUT OF THE STATE. SO IF WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN ELECTRIFYING LIGHT DUTY TRANSPORTATION. THAT SHOULD BE IT A GAME CHANGER NGUYEN IN CALIFORNIA IN TERMS OF MONEY SAVED AT THE PUMP. MONEY RECIRCULATING THROUGH OUR ECONOMY AND JOBS HERE IN THE STATE. I ALSO THINK AS WE AS WE- THINK ABOUT EQUITY- I. I WOULD SAY WE NEED TO THINK ALSO ABOUT HOW DO WE ENGAGE. GROUPS THAT CAN ADVISE US. BECAUSE I CAN SAY COMING FROM A SCIENTIFIC WORLD YOU DON'T NECESSARILY DO SCIENCE THAT IS APPLICABLE TO THE REAL WORLD AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYTHING WE DO. IS GROUNDED IN SOME KIND OF. UNITY BENEFIT THE WE CAN ARE TO. AND THAT WE CAN MEASURE. HISTORICALLY WE'VE MEASURED FROM OUR INVESTMENTS IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND ATTENTIVENESS IT'S JUST LIKE WELL HOW MUCH MONEY ARE WE SPENDING IN DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. SO WE'VE REACHED OUT TO THE DISADVANTAGED VIEWS ADVISORY GROUP AND ASK THEM FOR LIKE WHAT WHAT ELSE CAN WE DO BECAUSE THAT'S ONE METRIC BUT THAT'S NOT. ALL YOU KNOW THAT DOESN'T MEAN THERE ARE JOBS CREATED THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE HEALTH BENEFITS THAT DOESN'T MEAN. COMMUNITIES ARE DIRECTLY BENEFITING SO HOW DO WE DO HOW DO WE ENGAGE THE RIGHT PARTNERS WHO HELP ADVISE US SO THAT WE CAN DEVELOP CRITERIA. THAT IS JUST SORT OF A BIT MORE COMPLICATED A AND GIVES US MORE CONFIDENCE THAT WE ARE REALLY USING OUR MONEY IN A WAY THAT PROMOTES EQUITABLE TRANSPORTATION. RATE AS THANK YOU FOR THAT ANSWER AND LOOKING TO- VOTING ICE ON YOUR CONFIRMATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I ALSO WANT TO OFFER MY CONGRATULATIONS AND- YOU'RE MAKING THE REFERENCES TO THE- WOMEN IN SCIENCE RECOGNITION AND ALSO THE- CRITICAL MASS THAT'S BEEN ACHIEVED ON THE COMMISSION- I WANT TO PICK UP A LITTLE BIT ON THE EQUITY PIECE- RELATED TO. ELECTRIFICATION OF TRANSPORTATION- WHEN WE TALKED YESTERDAY. HE SHARED A LITTLE BIT ABOUT COLLABORATION WITH CARB IN IF YOU COULD SHARE THAT WITH THE COMMITTEE IN. WERE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE ON A RENEWABLE ENERGY WE'RE BEHIND ON OUR TRANSPORTATION OBJECTIVE SO WE'RE KIND OF PLAYING CATCH UP TO ADDRESS SOME OF THAT. ON THE EQUITY PIECE AS WELL THE DISTRICT I REPRESENT WE HAVE FARMWORKERS COMMUTING FROM KING CITY TO WATSONVILLE TO HARVEST STRAWBERRIES IN THAT. HOUR AND A HALF ONE WINNIE COMMUTE ON. AND IN OLDER VEHICLES NOT ENERGY EFFICIENT- HAD IS THAT POPULATION TRANSITION. TWO MORE FUEL EFFICIENT OR ELECTRICAL VEHICLES THANK YOU CENTER THAT'S THE THOSE ARE GOOD QUESTIONS SO LET ME START WITH THE COLLABORATIVE PIECE AND THEN- TALK ABOUT WHAT WE DO WITH- WITH FOLKS THAT YOU DON'T HAVE ANY CHOICE BUT TO USE OLDER VEHICLES TO GET TO AND FROM WORK- SO ON THE COLLABORATION PIECE- I AM I AM DEEPLY COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT WE ARE REALLY CLOSELY COLLABORATING ESPECIALLY WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD BUT ALSO THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION. INDEPENDENT SYSTEM OPERATOR- CALTRANS WE HAVE A LOT OF DIFFERENT PARTNERS WERE ENGAGED IN CLEAN TRANSPORTATION AND WE WANT TO BE STRATEGIC- WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD I TESTIFIED AT A RECENT RESOURCES BOARD HEARING. BOARD MEETING THAT. ARE FUNDING CLEAN TRANSPORTATION GOING TO BE INCREASINGLY FOCUSED ON THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND FUEL SIDE. AS A R. B. IS INCREASINGLY- YOU KNOW THEY'RE THE PREMIER AGENCY WHEN IT COMES TO VEHICLES SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR THEM TO ALSO LEAD IN THAT SPACE. WE ARE THE PREMIER ENERGY IT THE- COMMA INDUSTRY IN THE STATE INDUSTRIES ARE AGENCY IN THE STATE AND WE ARE COMMITTED TO MAKING SURE THAT AS WE- THAT WE pTO BE BENEFICIAL TO. OUR ENERGY GOALS AND ESPECIALLY TO OUR TWENTY FORTY FIVE SO IT MAKES SENSE FOR THE ENERGY COMMISSION TO FOCUS MORE ON INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WOULD BE- WHETHER THAT THAT'S THE BUILD OUT OF HYDROGEN FUEL CELL A INFRASTRUCTURE THE BUILD OUT OF REACH CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE FOR BATTERY ELECTRIC VEHICLES. THE INVESTMENTS IN- NEAR UP NEAR ZERO AND ZERO MISSION FUELS TO HELP WITH VEHICLES THAT ESPECIALLY THE ONES THAT CAN BE EASILY ELECTRIFIED THEY'RE STILL IN NEED TO ADDRESS THOSE VEHICLES- AND ADDRESS EMISSIONS FROM THOSE VEHICLES SO I EIGHT I FEEL THAT WE ARE GETTING MORE CLARITY BETWEEN EXPECTED THEIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE ENERGY COMMISSION ABOUT WHAT OUR RULES ARE AND WE'RE AND WE'RE WORKING VERY CLOSELY TO MAKE SURE THAT. WE ARE MAXIMIZING OUR UTILITY OF STATE DOLLARS IN TERMS OF HOW DO WE DEAL WITH. WE CHALLENGES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY OR A PLACES WHERE FOR. ARE NEED TO. ARTS CENTER COAST WHERE FOLKS NEED TO GET TO WORK THEY ONLY HAVE OLDER VEHICLES THEY DON'T HAVE A LOT OF MOBILITY OPTIONS BUT I WOULD SAY IS THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE- WE'RE ALREADY SEEING- A SHIFT IN THE A REGULATORY. THE REGULATIONS AROUND TRANSIT BUSES SO THOSE HAVE TO BE ELECTRIC. AND THE THERE IS AN OPPORTUNITY I THINK TO- TO FOCUS MORE OF OUR ATTENTION ON LAST MILE BETWEEN. BETWEEN THE WHERE THE BUS DROPS YOU OFF AND WHERE YOU NEED TO GET TO AGAIN THIS NEED TO BE A COLLABORATION WITH THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD- BECAUSE THERE'S A- THERE'S A VEHICLES COMPONENT TO THAT. BUT WE'RE THINKING THROUGH MORE SO HOW DO WE OPTIMIZE WHERE WE PUT CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE SO THAT WE CAN. INSURE IT SMACKS ME TO LEAVE IT ALSO THAT IT COULD SUPPORT POTENTIALLY THIS LAST FILE- I DO THINK THOUGH WE WILL NEED TO CAN TO FOCUS ON. YOU KNOW THIS THERE'S A ROLE FOR NATURAL GAS. AND ESPECIALLY WHERE WE CAN'T EASILY ELECTRIFY THERE'S A ROLE FOR. FOR FUELS THAT ARE LOWER IN CARBON. EVEN IF THEY'RE STILL YOU KNOW BECAUSE WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE LEGACY FLEET. AND AGAIN I THINK THE CHALLENGE BECAUSE BY POVERTY MAKES TRANSITIONING. LOW INCOME WORKERS ARE PART TIME WORKERS TO HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES THAT OTHERS DO. IN THE FARM LABOR SETTING- SOME FARM LABOR CONTRACTORS EMPLOYERS TO RELY ON BUSES AND WE'RE CONVERTING FLEETS IN AIRPORTS FOR A RENTAL. CAR AGENCIES TO ELECTRIC- IN IT MIGHT BE SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK TO. IN THE AGRICULTURAL ARENA AS WELL THERE'S SOME GOOD MODELS OUT THERE TOO I DON'T KNOW IF YOU KNOW RAYLEóN WHO'S THE MAYOR IF YOU'RE ON YES AND HE'S BEEN. WORKING ON HOW DO WE- BASICALLY ELECTRIFIED VEHICLES THAT ARE USED TO GET. FOLKS TO MEDICAL APPOINTMENTS AND TO WORK AND HE'S DOING SOME REALLY INNOVATIVE. OF WORK OUT THERE SO I THINK THERE ARE SOME GOOD EXAMPLES. AND WE NEED TO REPLICATE AND- EXPAND YOU KNOW THE NUMER OF EXAMPLES OUT THERE OF WAYS THAT WE CAN HELP EVERYBODY- GET ACCESS TO THESE VEHICLES WILL THANK YOU AND THEN JUST REAL QUICKLY IN A TRANSPORTATION SHEER AREA OF EXPERTISE WE TALKED A LITTLE OF THAT. OFF WIND IN JUST MAKE. SOME BRIEF. OF HOW YOU THINK THAT FITS IN OUR FUTURE AND- ACHIEVING CLEAN. RENEWABLE ENERGY GOAL HAPPY TO WELL THE ONLY WAY WE'RE GOING TO MEET. OUR GOAL OF HAVING A 1100% CLEAN GRID BY TWENTY FORTY FIVE IS TO HAVE A VERY DIVERSE SET OF RESOURCES THAT WERE USING. TO GENERATE ELECTRICITY. WE'RE EXCITED ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF OFF SURE WELL AFTER WIN BECAUSE IT COMPLIMENTS SOLAR IT COMPLIMENTS OF WINDS THAT THAT'S DONE ON SHORE. THE AND IT IT LOADS PRETTY MUCH ALL THE TIME SO THERE'S JUST MORE IT IT IN IN TERMS OF A RESOURCE THAT WOULD BE A GREAT ADDITION TO OUR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE A DIVERSE SET OF. SOURCES FOR ELECTRICITY WE WOULD LOVE TO CAPITALIZE ON THAT AS YOU WELL KNOW THERE ARE SOME ISSUES. WITH THE WITH THE NAVY THERE SOME ISSUES WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE DO THIS AN ENVIRONMENTALLY SOUND WAY AND OUR ROLE. HE HAS WITH THE WITH THE CHAIR LEADING THIS AS AS COMMISSIONER. TO PLAY CONVENING. AND BRING THE PARTIES TOGETHER. ENTER AND MAKE PROGRESS IN TERMS OF. ENSURING THAT WE ARE. GETTING THE KEY STAKEHOLDERS IN THE ROOM AND SO THAT WE CAN. IDENTIFY THE PROBLEMS AND HOPEFULLY WORK THROUGH THEM. THANK YOU AND I WANNA AGAIN. CONGRATULATE YOU BUT ALSO THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR EXPERTISE WITH THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR. THANK YOU SENATOR MINING LET ME PICK UP ON THAT- AREA THAT SENATOR MINING STARTED AND JUST. PUSH A LITTLE FURTHER ON THAT THE CONVENING. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY THIS ISN'T REALLY THE STATUS OF THE DELIBERATIONS AT THIS POINT RELATED TO MOVING FORWARD. WITH OFFSHORE WIND WITH OFF SHORE WELL INTERESTINGLY WE DECIDE ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY THAT PRESIDENT TRUMP IS SAYING THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT ISN'T GOING TO BE APPROVING ANY OFFSHORE WIND DEVELOPMENTS UNTIL AFTER THE ELECTION SO. THERE THERE IS- SOME YOU KNOW JUST IN TERMS OF THE NATIONAL POLITICS IT'S A LITTLE COMPLICATED I WOULD SAY- AT THEIR IT IT HAVE BASE. THE DO YOU GOVERNMENT HAS TEARS PAST THREE MILES SO WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE AN AGREMENT THAT IS SATISFACTORY TO THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT ADDED OKAY WELL SHOULD WE BE SUCCESSFUL AT SOME POINT DO YOU THINK THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD CONSIDER ESTABLISHING KIND OF A ONE STOP SHOP KIND OF LIKE WE'VE DONE OR THAT THE CDC IS DONE FOR THERMAL POWER PLANTS. HAVE YOU THOUGHT ABOUT. ON I HAVEN'T WILL AT NOT THOUGHT ABOUT THAT SO WE CAN. I CAN DELIVER IT WITH OUR STAFF AND GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT THANK YOU OBVIOUSLY THIS IS. OF FORWARD THINKING IN TERMS OF WHERE WE CAN GO SO I APPRECIATE THAT THE LAST- I THINK MY COLLEAGUES IT'S ALWAYS GOOD TO GO LAST THEY ASK ALL THE GOOD QUESTIONS- AND THE IMPORTANT ONES BUT- I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE EPIC PROGRAM AND- THE ROUGHLY A HUNDRED THIRTY MILLION THAT THE COMMISSION HAS THE ABILITY. TWO WOULD PUT OUT THE TO THE INTEREST. GROUPS ARE OUR INVESTMENTS IN ENERGY RESEARCH TO OUR CLEAN- TO CLEAN OUR GRID- THESE ARE RATE PAYER FUNDS- I THINK IN SOME RESPECTS THERE'S VERY FEW THAT ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAM. INCLUDING PEOPLE IN THE LEGISLATURE SO. HOW ARE THESE FUNDS BEING SPENT RIGHT NOW AND A AND MAYBE A LITTLE BIT HOW DO YOU THINK THEY'RE SAVING RATE PAYERS MONEY. WELL I'M REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS THAT WE'RE MAKING- IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EPIC DOLLARS. AND THAT'S BECAUSE THAT IT'S REALLY OPERATING AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF YOU KNOW BEFORE A PRE COMMERCIALIZED. PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE THEY WERE TRYING TO SUPPORT. THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FROM A VERY EARLY STAGE SO THAT WE CAN CAPITALIZE ON THOSE CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES. AGAIN HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN AN ERA OF WILDFIRES AND PUBLIC SAFETY POWERSHOT US. RIGHT WE'RE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS IN MICROGRAPHS. BOGGLING FOR IT READ RANCHERIA IS A REALLY GOOD EXAMPLE OF AN INVESTMENT THAT WE SUPPORTED. YOU KNOW THEY- IN THE LAST. THE SORT OF FIRES IN THIS LAST YEAR. THEY REPORTED THAT 10% OF ALL HUMBOLDT RESIDENTS. USE THE SERVICES AT THE RENTERIA. AND THAT THEY SAVED FOR LIVES. THOSE ARE THE KINDS OF INVESTMENTS WE WANT TO MAKE SURE. WE CONTINUE TO MAKE. TO SUPPORT A MORE RESILIENT ENERGY SYSTEM- WE'RE ALSO LOOKING AT TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAN ISLAND HOMES SO THAT YOU CAN WITH THE POWER SHUT OFF TO YOU CAN STILL USE YOUR- SOLAR AND YOU CAN. CONTINUE TO USE ELECTRICITY- BUT THE THIS IS IN MY MIND AWAY THAT CALIFORNIA IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO STAY. AT AT IN A LEADERSHIP ROLE NOT JUST HERE IN UNITED STATES BUT GLOBALLY. ON. CLEAN ENERGY IT CLEAN ELECTRICITY TECHNO. JEEZ THAT HELP US MAKE SURE WE CAN REACH OUR GOAL. WERE EVEN USING EPIC DAHLE. TO INVEST IN SOME. ADVOCATE AS A NOTED BEFORE. AT IF WE DO IT RIGHT SAVE MONEY WE SAVE ALL. CONSUMERS WE WANT TO DO A RIGHT AND WE WANT TO MAKE THE RIGHT INVESTMENTS SO THAT WE CAN CAPITALIZE ON THIS VEHICLE TO GRID. INTEGRATION WE FUNDED OVER TWO HUNDRED SCHOOL BUSES THAT ARE ELECTRIC AND THEY HAVE THE POTENTIAL NOT JUST TO ACTUALLY GIVE ELECTRICITY BACK TO THE GRID IS CALLED VGA OR VEHICLE TO GRID. AND WE'RE LOOKING AT USING SOME OF OUR EPIC DOLLARS TO CAPITALIZE ON THE POTENTIAL TO DO DEMONSTRATION ABOUT WHAT HOW DO WE HOW DO WE ACTUALLY DO THIS. HOW DO WE USE SCHOOL BUSES AS A RESOURCE WHEN THE GRID GET GOES DOWN. AND SCHOOL BUSES ARE PARTICULARLY ENTICING BECAUSE THEY'RE CHARGED- YOU KNOW THEY CAN BE CHARGING MIDDLE DAY WHEN WE HAVE A LOT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY PRODUCTION. THEY ALSO ARE NOT USED AS MUCH IN THE SUMMER WHEN WE ACTUALLY NEED THOSE RESILIENCE SERVICES. SO THOSE ARE THE TYPES OF PROJECTS THAT WE'RE INVESTING IN WITH OUR EPIC RESEARCH DOLLARS. VERY MUCH THANK YOU NOW I THINK WE'RE GONNA MOVE TO MEMBERS OF THE PUBLICWHO ARE HERE IN SUPPORT IN OPPOSITION LET ME ASK- MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC WHO ARE HERE IN SUPPORT IF YOU WOULD COME FORWARD- I WILL ASK YOU TO BE BRIEF- A GIVE YOUR NAME WHO YOU'RE WITH AND IF YOU SUPPORT A YOU KNOW. THE NOMINEES SO I. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR MANY DISCOUNT LEACOCK ON THIS YEAR DIRECTOR OF GOVERNMENT RELATIONS AND PUBLIC POLICY FOR PRO TERRA. LEADING TRANSIT ALL ELECTRIC BUSES MANUFACTURED HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE STRONGLY SUPPORT. COMMISSIONER MONAHANS REAPPOINTMENT TO THE FOR HER PRIOR BACKGROUND AS A TRANSPORTATION EXPERT AT THE OF THE ENERGY FOUNDATION AND THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS REALLY GIVE US CONFIDENCE THAT SHE IS THE RIGHT PERSON. TO LEAD THAT DIVISION INTO THE FUTURE- SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT HER NOMINATION THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR IS BILL WOULD WITH A CO FOR CORE AIR TO OF COMMISSIONER MONAHANS CONFIRMATION I THINK YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO SEE YOU TODAY WHY SHE'S SUCH A GREAT CHOICE TO IMPLEMENT THE LAWS THAT THE LEGISLATURE HAS PASSED TO CLEAN UP OUR ENERGY AND TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS. AND WE ESPECIALLY APPRECIATE HER DEMONSTRATE A COMMITMENT TO EQUITY IN CLEAN MOBILITY AND CLEAN ENERGY. THANK YOU. WELCOME GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND SENATORS MY NAME IS ABOUT TO ALIGN THE YEAR POLLUTION CONTROL OFFICER. AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR THE SACRAMENTO METRO AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND WE ARE HERE TO EXPRESS SUPPORT FOR COMMISSION AND MONAGHAN.

THE LEADERSHIP OF COMMISSIONER MONAGHAN AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION BECAUSE WE HAVE A LONG WAYS TO GO AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH HI WHY GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR MEMBERS TERESA COOK ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA HYDROGEN COALITION VERY HAPPY TO SUPPORT- COMMISSIONER MONAHANS APPOINTMENT I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE FUEL CELL DISCUSS. AN FOR VEHICLE THANK YOU MUCH BUT I AT CERTAIN THAT I'M TWO THOUSAND NINE WE WERE BEGINNING AND- ABOUT TO RENEW PART. STANDARD AND SACRAMENTO WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF WE WOULD HAVE HAD A SOLAR ONLY OF STRAW AND I THINK IT'S REALLY IN. THAT WE ARE PUTTING. A THE- BUT PACKED THESE ARE ON TWO TECHNO. YOU KNOW TWELVE SO WE CAN SURE EVER DRIVER CAL. HAS THE- OF AND AS CAN BE A- THANK. SORRY I ACTUALLY STARTED IN SUPPORT OF THE GRIEF HAVE IT TO REGISTER SUPPORT FOR THE GREEN LINING INSTITUTE AND COMMUNITIES FOR A BETTER ENVIRONMENT I'M WERE ALL MEMBERS OF AN ORGANIZATION CALLED CHARTER HAD CALIFORNIA- WHICH AIMS TO INCREASE ACCESS TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES I'M AND ABILITY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES AND WAS MONEY HAS A PROVEN TRACK RECORD OF REALLY ADVANCING EQUITY CLASS AND OUR CLIMATE AND CLEAN OUT THE GOALS ADAM AND WE'RE DELIGHTED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. AFTER CARRILLO SOMEHOW OF THE LECTURE VEHICLE TO. SO I REALLY JUST WANT TO SECOND MANY OF THE PREVIOUS COMMENTS THAT WERE MADE BY THE- MY COLLEAGUES AND I WOULD JUST ADD THAT. REALLY SUPPORT APPRECIATE COMMISSIONER MY HANDS COMMENTS ON FOCUSING ON INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE ENERGY COMMISSION WE KNOW THAT'S CAN BE A VERY VERY CRITICAL ASPECT. OF ACCOMPLISHING OUR GHG ENDS OF DEPLOYMENT GOALS SO IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. THANK YOU A GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR OF THE SENATORS BY NAMES OUT OF MY HOBBY HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE V. GO. AS THE NATION'S LARGEST AND MOST RELIABLE NETWORK OF PUBLIC ELECTRIC VEHICLE FAST CHARGING- WE'VE WORKED FIRSTHAND WITH MICHELLE MONAGHAN AND KNOW THAT SHE HAD KNOWS THE- THE POLICIES THE STAKEHOLDERS. MECHANISMS TO REALLY ARE SURE AND IN THE ERA OF CREEK TRAIL. FOR BUT RELIABLE E. I REALLY EQUITABLE FROM CALIFORNIANS SO WE ARE TO SUPPORT TODAY THANKS. THANK YOU. HELLO MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I AM AND THE OLSEN HERE HAVE ENTERED ECONOMY ECHO A LOT OF THE SENT TO. ALREADY INTEREST. STAND PROUDLY AND- OF COMMISSIONER. REPLAY MAY TO THIS.

HELLO MY NAME IS CHRISTIAN CORBY AND I'M THE DEPUTY EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA ELECTRIC TRANSPORTATION COALITION- EILEEN TIED OUR EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR- WASN'T ABLE TO BE HERE TODAY- BUT SHE WISHED TO BE HERE BECAUSE SHE WANTED TO- EMPHATICALLY ENDORSE A MISS MONAHANS REEMPLOYMENT. TO THE- ENERGY COMMISSION THANK THANK YOU VERY MUCH. HI WELCOME CATHERINE PHILLIPS WITH SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA WE ENTHUSIASTICALLY ENDORSE PATTY FOR THIS POSITION AND ALL THE GOOD THINGS THEY SAID WE AGREE WITH. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR JOHN WHITE FROM THE CENTER FOR THE DEFICIENCY RENEWAL TECHNOLOGIES IT'S BEEN MY GREAT PLEASURE TO WORK WITH COMMISSION MONAGHAN OVER MANY MANY YEARS SHE WAS THERE AT THE BEGINNING OF OUR PUSH FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLES AS AN ADVOCATE. SHE'S GOING ON TO A SUCCESSFUL CAREERIN PHILANTHROPY AND A WE REALLY APPRECIATE HER BEING AT THE COMMISSION RIGHT NOW GIVEN THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. ON A LECTOR TRANSPORTATION AND THE NEED FOR A DIVERSE PORTFOLIO AND PARTNERSHIPS WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AS WELL AS- A PRIVATE SECTOR SO WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER AND HOPE THAT SHE CAN HELP LEAD THE MINISTRATION. INSIST UP THE PARTS BECAUSE WILL BECOME AND WE NEED TO DO BETTER AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO DOING THAT. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M QUE REDNER SUTTER WITH ENVIRONMENT DEFENSE FUND I'M VERY. PLEASED TO BE HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS MONEY CONFIRMATIONS OF THE ENERGY COMMISSION EDF HAS WORKED WITH MISS MONEY HIM FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND I'M TRANSPORTATION AND QUALITY AND ENERGY ISSUES.

OVER THE LAST DECADE CALIFORNIA COMPANIES HAVE LED THE COUNTRY PERHAPS EVEN THE WORLD IN FINANCIAL SERVICES INNOVATION.

THANK YOU CENTER MINING THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR IN A WELCOME MR HOURS CONGRATULATIONS ON YOUR APPOINTMENT I ENJOYED OUR CONVERSATION YESTERDAY AND- COVER TO BRED TO THE ISSUES I THINK WHEN THAT MIGHT BE OF INTEREST TO THE PANEL- IS SAY AREA OF. CANNABIS BANKING THIS NEW INDUSTRY IN CALIFORNIA LEGALIZED INDUSTRY AND SOME OF THE CHALLENGES WITH FEDERAL RULES AND MAYBE A OVER VIEW OF HOW YOU'RE APPROACHING THAT TO THE EXTENT IT FALLS WITHIN YEAR ARENA OF REGULATION THANK YOU SIR APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TALK ABOUT SOME OF THE WORK THAT WE'RE DOING. FOR A LITTLE BIT OF CONTEXT I WOULD SAY. ALL OF OUR LICENSEE BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS UNDERSTANDS THE- PUBLIC SAFETY ISSUES POSED BY. AND THE CASH INTENSIVE INDUSTRY- AND THE CANNABIS RELATED BUSINESSES AND THERE IS. GENERALLY ACKNOWLEDGEMENT AND INTEREST IN HELPING TO. MEDICAID SOME OF THE CONCERNS RAISED BY THAT CASH INTENSIVE INDUSTRY. AS YOU KNOW OF COURSE THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL OVERLAY SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL PROBLEM TO ALL OF THESE CONVERSATIONS AND SORE LICENSEES ARE. IN A IN A BIT OF A BIND IT BECAUSE THEY ARE SOMETIMES AT A LOSS WITH HOW TO RESOLVE THE- LEGALITY AT THE STATE LEVEL WITH THE CONTINUED ILLEGALITY AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE OF DEPARTMENT. WE HAVE BEEN DOINGFOR THE LAST COUPLE MONTHS AND WHAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO DO IS TO MEET WITH OUR LICENSEES WHO ARE EITHER CURRENTLY BANKING CANNABIS RELATED BUSINESSES OR WHO MAY BE INTERESTED AND FORMALIZING PROGRAMS AROUND CANNABIS RELATED BUSINESSES. AND WERE SEEKING TO PROVIDE AS MUCH CLARITY AS POSSIBLE AROUND OUR EXPECTATIONS- AS THEIR STATE REGULATOR. WE ARE. CLEAR A FINE FOR OUR LICENSE. THAT BUT- WILL MANCE. INTERFERE GET IN THE WAY OF ANY BUSINESS PLANS THAT THEY MAY HAVE SOLELY BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEKING TO. PROVIDE SERVICES TO CANNABIS RELATED BUSINESSES- BACK IN OCTOBER THE DEPARTMENT ISSUED SOME GUIDANCE TO. BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS LAYING OUT THE DEPARTMENTS EXPECTATIONS- WHEN WE GO INTO EXAM IN AN INSTITUTION THAT IS TOUCHING CANNABIS RELATED BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY WE'VE- WE'VE CONVENED A COUPLE OF DEPOSITORY INSTITUTIONS AND A CANNABIS WORKING GROUP OF THE FIRST CONVENING WAS. NOVEMBER LATE NOVEMBER. AND WE BROUGHT TOGETHER LEADERSHIP FROM A HANDFUL OF DIFFERENT BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS TO DISCUSS. WHAT ADDITIONAL PAIN POINTS- THEY'RE FACING AND THE WAYSIN WHICH THE DEPARTMENT BUSINESS OVERSIGHT CAN POTENTIALLY PROVIDE GREATER CLARITY AND COMFORT TO THOSE BANKS- THOSE BANKS SEE SWEETS AND- BOARDS OF DIRECTORS SO WE WILL CONTINUE ALONG THAT PATH AND WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE AS MUCH. CLARITY AS POSSIBLE TO THOSE INSTITUTIONS THANK YOU VERY MUCH I ALSO WANT TO WELCOME YOUR FAMILY IN COLLEAGUES FOR THEIR SUPPORT AND- NO THIS IS A TEAM EFFORT SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR I'M I'M GOOD THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR MONEY MINING. CENTER ROTH. THANK YOU MISTER VICE CHAIR CONGRATULATIONS COMMISSION. SO JUST FOLLOWING ON MY COLLEAGUES QUESTIONS ABOUT BANKING DO YOU- HAVE ANY PARTICULAR CONCERNS ABOUT A LOCAL AGENCIES LOCAL GOVERNMENTS- ENTERING INTO THE BANKING ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN THE BILL THAT WAS RECENTLY PASSED. BUT MEETING TAKE A STEP BACK AND- AGAIN FOR PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE CONTEXT IN THAT ARENA. WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN MEETING WITH. VARIOUS REPRESENTATIVES OF SOME OF THE SOME OF THE CITIES THAT MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN PURSUING A PUBLIC BANK CHARTER AS AS AN OPTION. AND THE MESSAGE SHOULD THAT WE HAVE BEEN THE FUNDAMENTAL MESSAGE THAT WE HAVE BEEN REAL LANE TO THOSE PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS IS THAT ANY SUCH APPLICATION WILL BE REVIEWED ACCORDING TO THE SAME STANDARDS THAT THE DEPARTMENT WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER. FORMATION GROUP- AND THESE ARE STRINGENT STANDARDS WE'RE GOING TO BE LOOKING AT THINGS LIKE. CAPITAL ADEQUACY RATIOS WE'RE GONNA BE LOOKING TO THE CHARACTER AND OVERALL EXPERIENCE OF THE PROPOSED INSTITUTIONS MANAGEMENT BOARDS OF DIRECTORS. SO WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. PROSPECTIVE CITIES THAT MAYBE LOOKING TO FORM A PUBLIC BANK. HAVE TO MEET HIGH EXPECTATIONS. THEY ALSO HAVE TO MEET WITH FAIRLY STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE NEW PUBLIC BANK LAW INCLUDING- FDIC INSURANCE- WHICH WHICH IS NO SMALL FEAT- AND- AND THEY WOULD HAVE TO SECURE A FEASIBILITY STUDY SHOWING THAT- SHOWING THAT THEIR BUSINESS PLAN CAN SUCCEED OVER THE LONG TERM. I FRANKLY DON'T KNOW THAT I HAVE. ENOUGH INFORMATION TO FORM AN INDEPENDENT OPINION AS TO WHETHER THIS IS A GOOD THIN WHETHER THIS IS A BAD THING FRANKLY I DON'T KNOW THAT MY OPINION ON THE MATTER IS ALL THAT MATERIAL WHAT I WOULD SAY IS. I THINK SOME OF THOSE PROSPECTIVE INSTITUTIONS- WE'LL HAVE TO CLEAR OF THE FAIRLY HIGH BAR. HOW DID THE- HER PENSION. FACTOR INTO CAPITAL AND LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS FOR. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO SEEK TO FORM OF PUBLIC BANK. I THINK THAT I THINK THAT HAS A FANTASTIC QUESTION AND THE SHORT ANSWER IS. I DON'T EXACTLY KNOW BECAUSE THAT'S GOING TO BE ON THE THAT WILL BE LARGELY IN THE ONUS OF THE LOCAL. THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY HI THE LOCAL GOVERNING BODY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO FIGURING OUT THEIR THEIR OUTSTANDING PENSION OBLIGATIONS AND HOW BEST TO BALANCE THOSE OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES AGAINST SOME OF THE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ON WITH RESPECT TO PUBLIC THANK APPLICATION. SO THE SHORT ANSWER IS. IT'S HARD TO SAY WITH GREAT SPECIFICITY BUT IT'S ALSO HARD TO IMAGINE THAT OUTSTANDING PENSION OBLIGATIONS WOULD. MAKE IT EASY FOR PROSPECTIVE APPLICANTS TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS ADEQUATE CAPITAL RESERVED FOR A FOR A NEW BANK CHARTER WILL NOT NOT BEING AN ACCOUNTANT TO AS SOON. UNFUNDED LIABILITIES HAVE TO BE CARRIED ON A BALLOT SHEET SOMEWHERE- AND THAT SORT OF BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL STATEMENT AS SAID LIABILITY ANALYSIS. HAS TO BE PERFORMED BY SOMEONE IN DETERMINING AS SOON AS- VIABILITY OF THE PROPOSED ENTITY CORRECT. THAT'S CORRECT AND THAT WOULD ALL FEED INTO. THE PROPOSED ENTITIES BUSINESS PLAN WHICH IS A SUBSTANTIAL PART OF THE APPLICATION ITSELF AND ONE OF THE ONE OF THE CRITICAL FACTORS THE DEPARTMENT ASSESSES WHEN REVIEWING A NEW APPLICATION FOR BANK CHARTER IS. THE STRENGTH OF THE BUSINESS PLAN AND THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCCESS OVER THE LONG HAUL AS REFLECTEDIN THAT BUSINESS PLAN. FASCINATING SPERM CERTAIN WILL BE HAVING MORE CONVERSATIONS BOTH IN AND OUT OF THIS BUILDING ON THE SUBJECT BUT THANK YOU FOR BEING WILLING TO SERVE CONGRATULATIONS AGAIN ON A MOVE THE- A CONFIRMATION AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME THANK YOU MISTER FISHER. THANK YOU CENTER ROTH I'M SORRY WE DO NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET TOGETHER AND I SAID I DO HAVE A COUPLE QUESTIONS. QUESTION NUMBER ONE REGARDING THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE POWERS OF YOUR DEPARTMENT- AND IT LOOKS LIKE AS A BE QUITE BROAD. I'M JUST WONDERING IF YOU HAVE A- FILLED FOR THE EMPLOYMENT WHAT THE TIME LINE IS FOR THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT. AND THEN WE'LL HOW- WELL IT IN AND TAX FEES ON EXISTING ENTITIES LIKE- STATE CHARTERED BANKS AND CREDIT UNIONS. THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY- SOME OF THOSE ISSUES. THE WHAT I WOULD SAY LET ME START WITH RESPECT TO THE FEES. THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL SHOULD HAVE NO IMPACT NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FEES OF EXISTING LICENSEES NOW. THE MAJOR CABBIE OUT THERE OF COURSE IS THAT FEES AND ASSESSMENTS DO NATURALLY GO UP OVER TIME THINGS- ACOSTA DO GO UP BUT WITH RESPECT TO THE INCREMENTAL COSTS OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AND THE IMPACT ON EXISTING LICENSEES THERE SHOULD BE NO MATERIAL IMPACT AND- WE HAVE WE HAVE ALREADY BEEN MEETING WITH- WITH SOME OF OUR INCOME AND LICENSEES. IF OF COURSE BEEN ASKING THIS QUESTION AMONG OTHERS AND WE HAVE- WE HAVE CONVEYED AS MUCH I HOPE THE TWO- TO THOSE INCOME THAT LICENSEES. THE AT WITH RESPECT TO YOUR FIRST QUESTION I APOLOGIZE WOULD YOU PERJURE GATE IT. YOUR BRA THE POWER SO. WHAT IT WHAT IS LOOKING TO LOOK LIKE IN IN TERMS OF LIKE A TIME LINE FOR IMPLEMENTATION TO BRING IT TO FRUITION. JUST GENERAL QUESTIONS- GENERALLY SPEAKING. WE EXPECT TO WE EXPECT TO SPEND MUCH OF THE FIRST YEAR STAFFING UP SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE NEWER FUNCTIONS SO FOR EXAMPLE. SOME OF THE SOME OF THE PROPOSED OFFICES THAT ARE GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON EDUCATIONAL EFFORTS WE WANT TO START STAFFING OP THE LEADERS OF THOSE FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR SIMILARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE OFFICE OF TECHNOLOGY INNOVATION. WE WANT TO GET STARTED STAFFING UP THAT OFFICE WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR SO I WOULD SEE WHAT THEY WITHIN THE FIRST YEAR. THE MARKERS OF SUCCESS ARE GOING THE WEATHER WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO PLAN AND- LEADERSHIP FOR SOME THOSE FUNCTIONS. HERE TO I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE CAN REALLY START TO SEE SOME OF THE FRUITS OF LABOR WE TO. ENGAGEMENT WITH. TECHNO STAKEHOLDERS WE HOPE START TO DEVELOP A BETTER SENSE HOW. TO APPROACH SOME OF. EMERGING PRODUCTS AND SO. AND WE HOPE TO. WE HOPE. ENGAGE DEEPLY WITH SOME OF THE- SOME OF THE MORE VULNERABLE POPULATIONS THAT WE LOOK TO PROTECT INCLUDING VETERANS NEW AMERICANS AND THE ELDERLY- I THINK. I THINK ALL IN THE PROPOSAL AS WE HAVE CONTEMPLATED SHOULD BE FULLY IMPLEMENTED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD AND THAT'S THAT'S PRIMARILY A FUNCTION OF STAFFING- WE LOOKED AT THE AT THE NUMBERS AND- WE LOOKED AT THE NUMBERS OF INCREMENTAL HIRES AS WEALTHIEST HISTORICAL ATTRITION RATES. AND WE THINK WE CAN COMFORTABLY. BUILD UP THE NEW DEPARTMENT OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD AND WELL INTO THE FUTURE OF COURSE A GOOD. MY FINAL QUESTION JUST CURIOUS ON THE STATUS OF THE DEPARTMENTS RULE MAKING INITIATIVES IN PARTICULAR- WINDOWS HE DEPARTMENT OF BUSINESS OVERSIGHT EXPECT THAT THE RULES FOR SB TWELVE THIRTY FIVE RELATED TO COMMERCIAL FINANCE DISCLOSURES AND AGENTS OF FINANCIAL. FINANCIAL PROTECTION LAW. COME TO FRUITION. TWELVE THIRTY FIVE WE JUST WRITE THAT DOWN TWELVE THIRTY FIVE IS WELL UNDER WAY- I AM HAPPY TO FOLLOW UP WITH SPECIFIC DETAILS BUT I DO BELIEVE THAT WE'RE ON TRACK TO. IMPLEMENT A TWELVE THIRTY FIVE- BY END OF TWENTY TWENTY OR BY BY EARLY TWENTY TWENTY ONE- WE DID- FOR A BIT OF CONTEXT WE DID PUT OUT. A REQUEST FOR BID ON- USER TESTING OF THE NEW DISCLOSURES WE DID NOT RECEIVE ANY BIDS WE'RE NOT GOING TO LET THAT SLOW STAND WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH WITH THE RULE MAKING AS AS PLANNED. GREAT AB PRECIADO ST STE.
