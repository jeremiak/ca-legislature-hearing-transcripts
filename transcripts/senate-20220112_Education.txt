CENTER RUBIO IT'S ALWAYS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU WE WELCOME YOU PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU AND GOOD MORNING TO EVERYONE- AND THANK YOU TO. OPT CHAIR AND MAKE WIRE AND I NOTE THAT CHAIR IS LISTENING- REMOTELY. I AM PLEASED TO BE HERE TO PRESENT S. B. ABOUT THREE ON BEHALF OF SENATOR COVER YET- WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE STATE WITH AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS THE IMPACT THE FUNDS DEDICATED TO CLOSING THE STUDENT ACHIEVEMENT GAPS. SB THREE REQUIRES THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DEVELOP A LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN PORTAL. TO SERVE AS A TRACKING MECHANISM FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICES OF EDUCATION AND CHARTER SCHOOLS TO REPORT THE SERVICES FUNDED BY SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS. ADDITIONALLY THE BILL REQUIRES ELEAZAR RECEIVED THESE GRANTS TO REPORT THE SERVICES FUNDED BY THEM VIA THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. PORTAL THAT IS CREATED. GIVEN THE ON GOING. A COPY NINETEEN PANDEMIC OUR STUDENTS HAVE FACED CONTINUOUS BARRIERS AS A FORMER CLASSROOM TEACHER I UNDERSTAND FIRSTHAND THE DETRIMENTAL EFFECTS AND IMPACTS STUDENTS WILL EXPERIENCE. AS THE AFTERMATH OF THIS PANDEMIC THE CONSEQUENCES OF SCHOOLS CLOSING UNEVEN DISTANCE LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES% AND IT'S SEVERE ECONOMIC CRISIS HAS FURTHER DISPROPORTIONATELY AFFECTED OUR MOST VULNERABLE. STUDENT POPULATIONS IT IS MORE IMPORTANT NOW THAN EVER TO ENSURE THAT FUNDS MEANT TO SUPPORT HIGH NEED STUDENTS WILL BE USED FOR THAT PURPOSE. DURING THIS CRITICAL TIME IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. SB THREE WILL CREATE A MECHANISM TO TRACK INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION RELATED SERVICES FOR FOSTER YOUTH LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND ENGLISH LEARNERS. CURRENTLY EL CAP REPORTS HAVE US ARE SEGMENTED IN A STRUCTURE THAT IS UNFIT TO POP FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. AND IT IS EVEN MORE DIFFICULT TO UNDERSTAND THE EXACT IMPACT OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS DEDICATED TO SCHOOL FUNDING. INFORMATION GATHERED BY THESE REPORTS HAVE FAILED TO CAPTURE EXACTLY HOW MUCH MONEY INTENDED TO IMPROVE LEARNING OUTCOMES FOR UNDERSERVED STUDENTS MAINTAINS ITS PURPOSE. THE PORTAL WILL SERVE AS AN ONLINE TOOL TO IMPROVE THE TRANSPARENCY OF SPENDING DECISIONS AND PROMOTE SHARING BEST PRACTICES AMONG LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES. THIS BILL WILL ALLOW THE LEGISLATURE TO UNDERSTAND THE IMPACT OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION. ASSESS THE MEASURES FUNDED TO SERVE CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE PUPILS AND SIMPLIFY THE ALL CAP REPORTING METHODS TO MAKE VALUABLE INFORMATION EASY TO UNDERSTAND FOR THE PUBLIC. AND THE DECISION MAKERS WITH ME TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE IS ROBERT BUT WARNING FROM CHILDREN NOW AND CURSED AND FERAL FROM THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. AND AN ALTERNATE OVER TO THEM THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH MADAM SENATORS WONDERFUL TO SEE YOU ALL RIGHT LAYS IN GERMAN WE HAVE TO LEAVE IT'S A WITNESSES WERE GOING ASK OUR LEAD SUPPORT WITNESSES TO BE TO PROVIDE THEIR TESTIMONY IN TWO MINUTES- EACH IN OUR OF COURSE GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND WARNING. FOR IT'S GOING TO BE GOING TO ROBERT ROBERT REPRESENTS CHILDREN NOW ROBERT YOU ARE NOW LIVE IN EDUCATION COMMITTEE PLEASE PROCEED TO HAVE TWO MINUTES. THANK YOU SO MUCH I'M ROBERT VAN OR IN SENIOR ADVISOR CHILDREN NOW CHILDREN NOW ALONG WITH OUR CO SPONSORS TEACH PLUS. THE EDUCATION TRUST WEST IMPAIRED REVOLUTIONARY HERE TO SUPPORT SB THREE. THE LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA WILL ALLOCATE SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS. IN THIS NEXT BUDGET MAKING IT THE SINGLE LARGEST ITEM IN THE STATE BUDGET IN THAT SEVENTY BILLION DOLLARS AS OF ELEVEN A HALF BILLION DOLLARS. OF SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION GRANTS MONEY WHICH IS FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF ENGLISH LEARNERS LOW INCOME STUDENTS AND FOSTER YOU. SO THERE IS THIS MASSIVE INVESTMENT YET LITTLE OVERSIGHT OF THIS FUNDING. SB THREE WAS GOING TO HELP SB THREE WILL PROVIDE GREATER STATE OVERSIGHT OF THIS SPENDING. IN ADDITION IT WILL STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM OF TO IDENTIFY BEST PRACTICES FROM DISTRICTS TO MEET THEIR LOCAL. ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN GOALS- AND FINALLY IT'S GOING TO SUPPORT THE ENGAGEMENT AT EDUCATORS. AND COMMUNITY PARTNERS. IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. THIS BILL BUILT ON AN EXISTING PROJECT THAT WAS STARTED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGETS. TO COLLECT AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO INFORMATION IN THE OVER TWO THOUSAND HOW CAPS WRITTEN ACROSS THE STATE. THIS INITIAL PROJECT BEGAN IN TWENTY TWENTY WHAT IS JUST IN ITS INFANCY- AND DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC LEGISLATIVE DIRECTOR GOAL SB THREE PROVIDES THE DIRECTORS A GOLD SPECIFICALLY. IT ESTABLISHES LEGISLATIVE PRIORITIES FOR THE PORTAL. REQUIRES DISTRICTS TO PARTICIPATE BY TRANSFERRING DATA FROM THEIR L. CAPS. IN A LECTERN A TEMPLATE INTO THE PORTAL AND THEN REQUIRED THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO DESIGN QUERY TOOLS. TO PROVIDE EDUCATORS AND EDUCATIONAL PARTNERS INCLUDING PARENTS THIRTY SECONDS AND COMMUNITY GROUPS WITH ACCESS. TO THAT EL CAP DATA. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS IS A PART. THAT WILL STRENGTHEN THE- OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF L. CHIP THAT. CAN ACCOUNTABILITY SYSTEM THE STATE IS BUILT WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR SENATE BILL THREE I'M AVAILABLE TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT THE BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH AT THE ROBERT FROM CHILDREN NOW WE'RE NOT GONNA BE GOING TO KEROSENE KEROSENE IS A HARDWORKING TEACHER FROM VENICE HIGH WITHIN THE- LA UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT. KIRSTEN WE WELCOME YOU TO THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE YOUR NOW LIVE YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CARE LEYVA AND EDUCATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS. MY NAME IS KIRSTEN FARRELL AND I'M CURRENTLY THE ATHLETIC TRAINING COORDINATOR FOR THE LOS ANGELES UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT.

AND I AM CURRENTLY SERVING AS THE TEACH PLUS CALIFORNIA POLICY FELLOW. I AM HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB THREE. AS A LONGTIME EDUCATOR I SEE THE POWER OF LISTENING TO STUDENTS FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS. TO BEST ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF OUR COMMUNITY. BUT UNDERSTANDING THE EL CAPITAN THE L. CAP PROCESS IS NOT ALWAYS EASY. FOR EXAMPLE AN L. A. U. S. T. R. L. CAP IS A FOUR HUNDRED PAGE DOCUMENT. I CONSIDER MYSELF TO BE A PRETTY EDUCATED INDIVIDUAL. BUT IS STILL TEDIOUS TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT MEANS FOR MY SCHOOL AND MY STUDENTS. IN ADDITION HOW CAN WE EXPECT OUR PARENTS. MANY OF WHOM ARE NOT NATIVE ENGLISH SPEAKERS AND MAY NOT HAVE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO FURTHER THEIR OWN EDUCATION. UNDERSTAND THE MYRIAD OF COMPLEXITIES. AND FEEL THAT THEIR OPINIONS ARE VALUED. ADDITIONALLY AS A FORMER HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER I SEE THE VALUE OF ASKING STUDENTS DIRECTLY WHAT THEY NEED. BUT HOW CAN WE EXPECT STUDENTS TO UNDERSTAND THESE MASSIVE DOCUMENTS AND ENGAGE WITH THEM. SB THREE IS AN ESSENTIAL STEP TO ENSURE THAT THE STATE IS HELPING TO MAKE THIS INFORMATION UNDERSTANDABLE TO FAMILIES AND EDUCATORS THIRTY SECONDS WE NEED TO SEE HOW IT IS AT ALL AS THAT'S MEANT FOR HIGH NEED STUDENTS ARE HELPING THEM. AND LEARNING FROM OTHER DISTRICTS THAT HAVE HAD THE SUCCESS WITH THE STUDENT GROUP. I URGE THE STATE LEGISLATOR SURE TO PASSED SB THREE TO PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INFORMATION TO ENSURE HEALTHY UP AT ITS FULFILLING ITS PROMISE. NOT JUST FOR MY STUDENTS BUT FOR ALL THE STUDENTS IN CALIFORNIA THEY ARE OUR FUTURE AND THEY CAN'T AFFORD FOR US TO WAIT. THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY.

THANK YOU AND I TO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR RAIN THIS BILL FORD APPRECIATE CENTER RUBIO OF BEING HERE TO PRESENT THE BILL I DO HAVE A QUESTION. THAT DERRY HOPE THAT- YOU'RE ABLE TO ANSWER- SO CERTAINLY AGE DOES STRONGLY AGREE WITH THE PURPOSE OF THE BILL TO INCREASE TRANSPARENCY CAN YOU PERHAPS ADDRESS IF YOU'RE ABLE TO. AND I KNOW YOUR SIR SUBSTITUTING FOR SARAH CABALLERO- THIS PORTAL IS IT'S GOING TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL- I GUESS- BURDENS FOR REPORTING OR IS IT USING EXISTING DATA- THAT. THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S READY REPORT SO I JUST WANT TO UNDERSTAND- WHAT'S THE REPORTING BURDEN ON THE SCHOOL DISTRICT'S FOR USING THIS PORTAL I THINK THE TRANSPARENCY REPORT AND CERTAINLY WORTH COLLECTING MORE DATA BUT ALSO MIGHT BE SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT- SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE. A PRETTY OVER BURDEN RIGHT NOW AND- ARE WE GONNA BE ASKING THEM TO HAVE TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL REPORTS OR DO ADDITIONAL DATA COLLECTION OR TO FULFILL THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE SAID BILL. THANK YOU US SENATOR WILL REALLY THIS IS TO SIMPLIFY AND UNDERSTAND THE REPORTING BETTER BUT I WILL TURN IT OVER TO ONE OF THE WITNESSES THAT CAN ARTICULATE BETTER. HOW THIS IS GOING TO BE DONE. THANK YOU I THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THE MODERATOR AND OUR TECH TEAM IS ABLE TO QUEUE UP EITHER ROBERT OR KIERSTEN. ROBERT I'M GOING TO GO FIRST TO YOU TO BE ABLE TO ANSWER. THAT SENATOR PANS QUESTION ROBERT YOU ARE NOW LIVE BACK IN COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE QUESTION- THE ADDITIONAL- ADDITIONAL WORK THAT THAT SOME. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES MIGHT HAVE TO DO IS THAT THEY WOULD HAVE TO USE THE STATE ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE FOR IT EL CAP SO RIGHT NOW EVERY DISTRICT IN THE STATE HAS TO WRITE A LOCAL CONTROL ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN. BUT THEY TECHNICALLY DON'T HAVE TO USE THE ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE TO DO THAT ALMOST ALL JUNE- THIS BILL BECAUSE IT WOULD TAKE THE INFORMATION IN THAT ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE TO POPULATE THE DATABASE- WOULD REQUIRE THE USE OF THAT ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE- SO THAT WOULD BE THE ONE ADDITIONAL WORKLOAD REQUIREMENT BUT WE THINK THAT'S RELATIVELY MINIMAL- THE TO ALEXA AND HAMPLE TOOL HAS BEEN DESIGNED. TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE TO FILL OUT AND- ALL THE LARGE DISTRICTS AND ALMOST ALL DISTRICTS IN THE STATE USE THAT. OKAY AND JUST TO CLARIFY SIR AT FIFTY IF THE SCHOOL DISTRICT IS USING ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE AND THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL REPORTING BURDEN. THAT- IS THAT REQUIRED OF THEM. H. BE ABLE TO TAKE THAT INFORMATION AND ONE THING YOU HAVE BEEN APPROVED EL CAPIT SHOULD TAKE THE DATA FROM THAT- CAPPING AND LOADED UP I MEAN THERE WILL HAVE TO BE LIKE. A MECHANISM TO LOADED- SO THERE MIGHT BE A BETTER MINIMAL WORKLOAD ASSOCIATE WITH THAT BUT IT IT SHOULDN'T BE A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN WORKLOAD. OKAY ALL RIGHT NOW I APPRECIATE THAT- CERTAINLY I HOPE THAT IN ITS IMPLEMENTATION OBVIOUSLY THIS BILL ISN'T GONNA SPEAK TO THAT WOULD THAT WE TRY TO MINIMIZE THE BURDENS ON. SCHOOL DISTRICTS IF THEY'RE USING SPECIALLY DESIGNED ELECTRONIC TEMPLATE- THAT IT'S GOING TO BE THAT WE TRIED DESIGN A WAIT SO WE CAN EXTRACT THE DATA WITHOUT REQUIRING ADDITIONAL WORK ON BEHALF SCHOOL DISTRICTS BUT- APPRECIATE THE BILL AFFECT- WELL MOVED THE BILL AS APPROPRIATE.

TWENTY ONE MORE TIME AT CENTER DAILY DO YOU MIND REPEATING THAT I APOLOGIZE SIR KELLY HI GLAZER. HI GLAZER AYE MCGUIRE. MCGUIRE AYE PAN HI CAN I SEVEN ZERO BY THAT IS A SEVEN ZERO VOTE THAT BILL IS OUT AND WE'RE CLOSING THE ROLE THANK YOU SO MUCH AND RUBIO THANK YOU TO OUR MEMBERS FOR THE ENGAGEMENT LETTERS IN GENERAL COMMITTEE WERE NOW MOVING ON TO OUR SECOND DAUGHTER FIVE TODAY ON OUR DOCKET THIS IS SENATE BILL TWO EIGHTY SIX THAT SENTIMENT HAS BEEN WORKING. WITH THE AN ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION ON THIS ISSUE THAT CENTER MINUTES CAN BE PARTICIPATING REMOTELY TODAY CENTER MAIN WE WELCOME USER COMMITTEE YOU ARE NOW LIVE ON S. B. TWO EIGHTY SIX. PLEASE PROCEED. I COULD SHARE MEMBERS STAFFERS ALL I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND I. WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS SUGGESTED ON PAGE THREE THE ANALYSIS. TO CLARIFY THAT S. B. TWO EIGHTY SIX APPLIES ONLY TO ELECTIONS FOR SEATS ON THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. DUE TO TIME CONSTRAINTS THESE AMENDMENTS WILL BE MADE IN THE SENATE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. NOW THIS BILL SB TWO EIGHTY SIX IS BASED ON A SIMPLE PROPOSITION. ONE THAT'S BEEN RECOGNIZE THROUGH ALMOST ALL OF THE STATE. BOARD OF EDUCATION AT THE COUNTY LEVEL ISA VERY IMPORTANT GOVERNMENTAL BODY. AND AS SUCH ELECTIONS FOR THE SEATS SHOULD TAKE PLACE IN NOVEMBER WITH THE FALL ELECTORATE RATHER THAN IN THE PRIMARY- WITH LOWER TURN OUT AS IS THE CASE IN ORANGE COUNTY. AS WE KNOW TURNOUT IS FAR FAR LOWER IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS AND GENERAL ELECTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE IN 202-800-8018 THOUSAND ORANGE COUNTY VOTERS VOTE IN THE PRIMARY. AS OPPOSED TO ONE POINT FIVE FIVE MILLION VOTERS IN THE GENERAL ELECTION BY NEARLY TWO FOLD INCREASE. I'VE TALKED TO MANY VOTERS IN MY DISTRICT HAVE EXPRESSED FRUSTRATION OR CONFUSION ABOUT THE FACT THAT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO VOTE FOR THEIR BOARD OF EDUCATION RACE. SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY DID NOT VOTE IN THE PRIMARY ELECTION. COUNTY BOARD OF ED SERVE CRITICAL FUNCTIONS IN OUR STATE. BY PROVIDING OVERSIGHT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS EDUCATING STUDENTS WITH SPECIAL NEEDS AND PROVIDING DIRECT SERVICES TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS. MORE THAN MEMBERS ALSO PLAY AN INFLUENTIAL AND POWERFUL ROLE IN THEIR OUTREACH EFFORTS TO THE COMMUNITY. PARENTS AND STUDENTS BOTH IN THEIR DISTRICTS BUT ALSO THROUGHOUT THE STATE. THAT'S WHY IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE MAKE EVERY EFFORT TO GET MORE VOTERS ENGAGED IN THESE CRITICAL LOCAL GOVERNING BOARDS. ORANGE COUNTY'S PRACTICE OF HOLDING ITS BOARD OF EDUCATIONAL ACTIONS IN THE PRIMARY. IS AN OUT LIAR COMPARED TO ALMOST EVERY OTHER COUNTY ACROSS THE STATE. FROM THE COUNTY BOARD THE DEAD HAD CANDIDATE ELECTIONS IN TWENTY TWENTY FORTY TWO OF THEM APPEAR ON THE NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTION BALLOT. ONLY FIVE INCLUDING ORANGE COUNTY HOW COUNTY ELECTIONS FOR THESE BOARDS. ON THE PRIMARY BALLOT IN TWENTY TWENTY. NOW PLEASE TURN OUT DIFFERENCES. PRIME RANGING ELECTIONS EFFECTIVELY DISENFRANCHISE MANY VOTERS IN ORANGE COUNTY NEARLY HALF OF ALL VOTERS IN TWENTY TWENTY. AND THE PARTICULARLY PRONOUNCED AMONG RACIAL AND ETHNIC MINORITIES. YOUNG PEOPLE AND LOW PROPENSITY VOTERS. IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED THAT LIMITED ENGLISH PROFICIENT VOTERS. YOUNGER VOTERS BETWEEN THE AGES OF EIGHTEEN AND THIRTY FIVE. AN AFRICAN AMERICAN ASIAN AMERICAN AND LATINO VOTERS VOTE AT MUCH HIGHER RATES IN GENERAL ELECTIONS BEEN IN PRIMARY ELECTIONS. SB TWO EIGHTY SIX WOULD REQUIRE THAT ELECTIONS THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. BE CONSOLIDATED WITH THE STATEWIDE GENERAL ELECTION IN NOVEMBER INSTEAD OF THE PRIMARY ELECTION. AND THAT WOULD APPLY THE SAME ELECTION TIME LINES CURRENTLY IN PLACE FOR THE MAJORITY COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. TO ORANGE COUNTY. SB TWO EIGHTY SIX WOULD INCREASE VOTER PARTICIPATION. IN THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION OFFICE THE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION ELECTIONS. AND REDUCE VOTER CONFUSION BY CREATING UNIFORMITY AROUND THE TIMING OF THESE IMPORTANT ELECTIONS. ONLINE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL I HAVE ELIZABETH WARREN PARKER. PAST PRESIDENT OF THE ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD'S ASSOCIATION. AND THERESA RAY CHAIR OF THE SUPPORTERS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION ONE COUNTY. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER INCREASE YOUR WORK ON THIS AT LEAST IN GENERAL CAN BE GOING TO OUR FIRST SET LEAD WITNESSES WILL BE. PARTICIPATING REMOTELY WE'RE GONNA BE GOING TO DOCTOR DORN PARKER PAST PRESENT ORANGE COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD ASSOCIATION. MISTER PARKER YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES I'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT YOU ARE NOW LIVE IN EDUCATION COMMITTEE PLEASE PROCEED. THANK YOU AS I HAVE SERVED THIRTY TWO YEARS ON THAT CORNY BOARD OF EDUCATION MYSELF. I ACKNOWLEDGE HOW LITTLE IS UNDERSTOOD ARE KNOWN ABOUT THE CRITICAL LEADERSHIP ROLE. ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION SERVE WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. EXCEPT FOR JUVENILE JUSTICE SCHOOLS COMMUNITY SCHOOLS. THESE BOARDS ARE VERY DIFFERENT RESPONSIBILITIES FROM THOSE UP LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AS DEFINED IN AT CONSTRUCTION. TEN FOURTEEN TEN FORTY TWO. THE ONLY ELECTED BOARD TO FOCUS ON THE STUDENT ENROLLED IN JUVENILE AND COMMUNITY SCHOOL OUR COUNTY pIN THE SCHOOLS ARE OUR MOST VULNERABLE THEY CAN INCLUDE A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF HOMELESS FOSTER YOU. L. G. B. T. Q. PLUS. CHILDREN KICKED OUT OR DROPPED OUT THEREFORE THEY NEED TRUSTEE TO PRIORITIZE YOUR EDUCATIONAL. SOCIAL AND EMOTIONAL ME. HERE ARE MOST AT PROMISED TO HAVE A LEAD TO BLOW IMAGE TRUSTEE HYPER FOCUSED ON THEIR WELL BEING. THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTERS NEED TO ELECT THEM IN ORANGE COUNTY IN PARTICULAR MOVING THE ELECTION FROM JUNE PRIMARIES TO NOVEMBER'S GENERAL ELECTION WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER OF VOTERS SELECTING THE TRUSTEES FOR THESE CHILDREN. THE SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE CHILDREN LIVE IN TRADITIONALLY DISENFRANCHISED COMMUNITIES. AND MANY AND ROLE IN THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION SCHOOL. THE MORE VOTERS TO UNDERSTAND THEIR CHALLENGES AND LIVED EXPERIENCES THE MORE LIKELY THEY WILL ELECT EDUCATIONAL LEADERS TO UNDERSTAND AND PRIORITIZE THEIR NEEDS. WHEN I BEGAN MY TENURE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO ON THIS ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. NONE OF US APPRECIATED HOW MUCH IT MATTERS WHO VOTED IN THREE. THE IMPORTANCE OF THESE TRUSTEES IS NOW UNDENIABLE AS MAYA ANGELO SO ELOQUENTLY SAID DO THE BEST WE CAN. UNTIL WE KNOW BETTER THAN WE KNOW BETTER WE BETTER DO BETTER WE NOW KNOW BETTER THIRTY MUST HELP THESE CHILDREN B. C. B. ELECTED EDUCATIONAL LEADERSHIP. THEY DESERVE AND MOVED THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATIONALISTS FROM THE PRIMARY IN JUNE TO THE GENERAL IN THE PAST. THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH ARE TO REALLY GREAT OF YOUR PARTICIPATION TODAY. ALL RIGHT LAYS IN GENERAL CAN BE GOING TO OUR SECOND AND FINAL LEAD WITNESS THAT'S MISTER RAY SHE'S THE CHAIR AND SUPPORTERS OF PUBLIC EDUCATION ORANGE COUNTY COMMITTEE. MYSTERY WELCOME TO COMMITTEE THE FLOOR IS YOURS YOU HAVE TWO MINUTES AND I'LL GIVE YOU. THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. PLEASE PROCEED. BUT MORE SENATORS AND THANK YOU FOR WHAT YOU'RE DOING TODAY. I'M RETIRED HIGH SCHOOL TEACHER OF FOR DECADES AND UNION PRESIDENT WITH EXTENSIVE EXPERIENCE COLLABORATING WITH MY LOCAL SCHOOL BOARD. I CURRENTLY ARE THE COUNTY WIDE NETWORK. YEAH YOUR ATTENTION OF.

C. FOLLOWING THE ACTIONS OF LOCAL SCHOOL BOARDS AND ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF EDUCATION. SUPPORT MOVING THE ELECTION FOR THE ORANGE COUNTY BOARD OF THE TRUSTEES FROM JUNE TO NOVEMBER TO PROVIDE BETTER REPRESENTATION FOR ALL TWENTY NINE LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND MORE IMPORTANTLY FOR THE STUDENTS SERVED BY THE ORANGE COUNTY DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION. BUILDING FOR TRUSTEES IN NOVEMBER EMPHASIZES THE IMPORTANCE OF THAT BOARDS WORK CURRENTLY THIS RACES JUSTIN OUT ONTO A PRIMARY AND THEREFORE SEEMS INSIGNIFICANT GET THIS ELECTION IS A ONE AND DONE IT IS THEREFORE MORE IMPORTANT THAN A PRIMARY ELECTION. BASICALLY IT COMES DOWN TO THE FACT THAT MORE PEOPLE VOTE IN NOVEMBER GENERAL ELECTIONS AND THE JUNE PRIMARIES IN 202048% MORE ORANGE COUNTY VOTERS PARTICIPATED IN THE NOVEMBER GENERAL THAN IN THE JUNE PRIMARY AT THE DEMOCRACY WE WANT THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE VOTERS TO PARTICIPATE IN ELECTIONS. GOD VOTER PARTICIPATION IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN THE OCP ELECTION BECAUSE IT IS DECIDED BY A PLURALITY NOT A MAJORITY. CURRENTLY SOME TRUSTEES EARNED ONLY 33% OF THE VOTE YET THEY MAKE DECISIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MOST VULNERABLE CHILDREN THROUGHOUT THE COUNTY THIRTY SECONDS PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT. THAT'S THE HIGHEST NUMBER OF VOTERS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATE AND OCB ELECTIONS WHICH ARE DECIDED MERELY BY PLURALITY. MOVING THE ELECTIONS IN NOVEMBER WOULD ENSURE MORE FAIR RESULTS PLEASE VOTE TO APPROVE SB TWO EIGHTY SIX THANK YOU.

SENATE REQUIRE AND SENATOR LEYVA OR CHAIR LEYVA OR- THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENTS SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN AND DOCTOR PANDITS WHO IS WILLING 2% IN ANY EVENT THAT I COULD NOT CORRECT. PRESENT REMOTELY SO THANK YOU ALL FOR YOUR COOPERATION- I'D LIKE TO START OBVIOUSLY BY THANKING THE COMMITTEE STAFF. AND THE CHAIR- SO OFFICE FOR WORKING DILIGENTLY WITH MY STAFF AND THE SPONSORS OF THIS BILL. TO GET IT IN THE PLACE WHERE IT IS TODAY- CALIFORNIA IS IN THE MIDST OF A YOU YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS. EXACERBATED BY THE COLD WITH NINETEEN PANDEMIC NOTHING WE ALLDON'T. SEE IN OUR DISTRICT SAID AROUND OUR FAMILIES AND AROUND A CALIFORNIA. WITH DISTANCE LEARNING OUR YOUTH ARE INCREASINGLY ISOLATED AND DISENGAGED WITH DEPRESSION SYMPTOMS. AT ALL TIME HIGH FOR HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. ACCORDING TO THE U. S. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES NEARLY ONE IN THREE CALIFORNIA HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. SURVEYED REPORTED FEELING SAD OR HOPELESS ALMOST EVERY DAY FOR TWO OR MORE WEEKS IN A ROW. NEARLY ONE IN FIVE REPORTED THAT THEY HAVE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED ATTEMPTING SUICIDE. I DON'T WANT TO READ ANOTHER CHILD TAKING THEIR OWN LIFE- IN CALIFORNIA I JUST DON'T WANT TO READ ABOUT IT SH I DON'T WANT TO SEE IT AND I THINK WE NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT TO TEACH. TEACHERS AND SCHOOL STAFF ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF THESE CRISES. AS OUR STAFF HAS SUCH MUST BE TRAINED TO IDENTIFY AND HELP STUDENTS WHO ARE SUFFERING- IF YOU REMEMBER. LAST YEAR WHEN WE PRESENTED THIS BILL THE FATHER WHO CALLED IN AND TALKED ABOUT A FOURTEEN YEAR OLD DAUGHTER. WHO TURNED IN HER- JOURNALIST SIMON IN SCHOOL. I'VE GOT AN A ON THE ASSIGNMENT AND THEN SHORTLY THEREAFTER TOOK HER OWN LIFE. AND THE FATHER WAS CHAU. BUT POIGNANT IN THAT HE SAID I DON'T PLAY THE TEACHER FOR NOT SEEING THIS. OF SUICIDE IN DAUGHTER JOURNAL BE THE TEACHER WASN'T. THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE TRAINED AND RESEARCH SHOWS. THAT THE SOONER PEOPLE GET HELP FOR MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE USE CONCERNS THE MORE LIKELY THEY ARE TO HAVE POSITIVE OUTCOMES. THIS BILL IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN EVER BECAUSE THE SCHOOLS ARE TRANSITIONING. CAN PERSON LEARNING AND FRANKLY YOU KNOW MANY OF THEM. HAVE GONE TO A HYBRID APPROACH RECENTLY TEACHERS ARE ENCOUNTERING BEHAVIOR HEALTH ISSUES RESULTING FROM EMOTIONAL IMPACTS OF THE PANDEMIC ON THEIR STUDENTS. THE REALITY IS THAT WHEN STUDENTS RETURN TO SCHOOL THEIR TRAUMA AND DEPRESSION RETURN WITH THEM. IF WE DON'T TRAIN TEACHERS THEY WILL BE LEFT OUT. WITHOUT THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO HELP IDENTIFY CRISIS WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE STAFF. ADMINISTRATORS EVERYONE THAT COMES IN CONTACT WITH THEIR KIDS. HAS THIS TRAINING- IT. A LACK OF TRAINING DOESN'T KEEP THE STUDENTS DEPRESSION OR SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER AT HOME- WELL LIKE EXISTING LAW CALLS FROM THE CUE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IDENTIFIED EVIDENCE BASED MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING PROGRAM. IT DOES NOT REQUIRE SCHOOLS TO ESTABLISH THE TRAINING PROGRAM FOR THEIR STUDENTS STAFF AND TEACHERS. SB THREE EIGHTY SEVEN HELPS ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM BY REQUIRING THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF. EDUCATION TO ENSURE THAT 75% OF ALL ITS CLASSIFIED AND CERTIFIED EMPLOYEES ON SCHOOL CAMPUSES. COMPETE COMPLETE AN EVIDENCE BASED BEHAVIORAL TRAINING PROGRAM. MANDATING OF THE EVIDENCE BASED PROGRAM FOR I WILL PROVIDE ESSENTIAL INSTRUCTIONS. ON HOW STUDENTS TEACHERS AND STAFF CAN BEST PROVIDE REFERRALS TO MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER SERVICES OR OTHER SUPPORT INDIVIDUAL. INDIVIDUALS IN CRISIS I WANT TO BE CLEAR. THIS TRAINING DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO TURN STAFF AND TEACHERS. INTO MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS. THIS MANDATED TRAINING SIMPLY TEACHES AN INDIVIDUAL HOW. TO SPOT WHEN THERE IS A PROBLEM. WITH THIS OR- IN FACT I SEE THIS JUSTICE THE CENTER C. OR FIRST AID TAKE A FIRST AID COURSE DOESN'T MAKE YOU A MEDICAL PROFESSIONAL TAKING A FIRST AID COURSE TRAINS YOU. ON HOW TO GET HELP WHEN YOU SEE A CRISIS AND THIS IS WHY WE MUST ALSO SHOW THAT WE VALUE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS OF STUDENTS. JUST LIKE WE VALUE PHYSICAL HEALTH NEEDS WE'RE STILL IN A PANDEMIC AND WE CANNOT AFFORD TO IGNORE THIS ISSUE STUDENTS ARE PRESENTED WITH. KIDS NEED OUR HELP TO BE SAFE AT SCHOOL AND THEY SHOULD BE BANNED THERE SHOULD INCLUDE MENTAL HEALTH TRAINING THIS BILL IS SPONSORED BY A BROAD COALITION OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND MENTAL HEALTH ADVOCATES INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL COMMUNITY HEALTH AGENCIES. THE CALIFORNIA STUDENT WORK ARE STUDENT BOARD MEMBERS ASSOCIATION DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA GENERATION UP AN INSEPARABLE ON THE PHONE WITH ME TODAY I HAVE TO WORK YOUR WORK BACK TEACHER SPECIALIST AT COLLEGE VIEW SCHOOL.

SECOND PROMPT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CORKY ARE WORK AND I'VE BEEN A TEACHER OF GENERAL EDUCATION AND SPECIAL EDUCATION FOR THIRTY EIGHT YEARS. I HAVE TAUGHT IN DENVER BOSTON AND NOW L. A. COUNTY FOR MY ENTIRE CAREER AND I HAVE NEVER BEEN MANDATED TO CREATE IN MENTAL HEALTH AWARENESS. I MADE A CALIFORNIA TO TEACH IN NINETEEN NINETY ONE I GOT CAUGHT. SUFFERING FROM DEPRESSION ANXIETY OF. THE HOME EXCESSIVE AGGRESSION. WITH VITAL IDEATION IT'S A GREAT IDEA AND SELF HARM. AND LET ME REITERATE I HAVE NEVER BEEN GIVEN THE TRAINING TO EFFECTIVELY AND APPROPRIATELY DEAL WITH THE SEVERE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. I HAVE VOLUNTARILY SOUGHT OUT THE TRAINING BUT TO LEAD TO THIS KIND OF CRITICAL TRAINING THE VOLUNTARY PARTICIPATION IT'S LIKE PREACHING TO THE CHOIR. IT'S THE MAJORITY OF TEACHERS SUPPORT STAFF AND RESOURCE PROVIDERS THAT MARK. HAVE TRAINING. BILL IS ASKING 45% THE AND CLASSIFIED PERSONNEL TO BE TRAINED IN MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND I ASKED WHY NOT A HUNDRED PERCENT. ALL SCHOOL PERSONNEL SHOULD BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY IF SUPPORTERS. WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES THIS MAY BE AS SIMPLE AS NOTICING THE SAME. COMING HOME LATE EVERY MORNING HERE ON WATCHED WEARING THE SAME CLOTHING EVERY DAY I KNOW NOT BUT ONCE DOING ONE AND SHE MAY NOT OPEN UP TO ME BUT I COULD BRING COULD BLOW THAT SOMETHING IS AMISS.

LONELINESS AND KNOWING WHERE TO TURN THIRTY SECONDS IN EIGHT POWER FOR HEIGHTS- CHRONICALLY FATTER HOPEFULLY. I HAVE A CLASS OF THIRTY. BUT. IT FROM THE MEDIA OUR SOCCER IN SOME.

THE MORNING CHAIRWOMAN THEY'VE FELON. MY NAME IS PATTERSON AT I SERVE AS A MEMBER OF THE SAN DIEGO BORDER THAT.

I THINK IT'S FOR STUDENT AT MY SCHOOL A FRIEND OF MINE. JOHN JOHN WITH MY CLASSMATES FELLOW TRACK RUNNER AND SO MUCH MORE. I TRULY APPRECIATED JOHN FOR WHAT HE WAS A BRAVE BOY WHO BRIGHTENED EVERYONE'S DAY. DESPITE THIS THERE WAS ALWAYS SOMETHING UNDERLYING THE INCESSANT JOKES ABOUT SUICIDE. THE FREQUENT SUDDENNESS THAT WOULD OVERCOME THEM. I DIDN'T KNOW HOW TO RESPOND. I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO. I DID WHAT MOST KIDS DO. NOT MUCH ANY OF TWENTY TWO. MY JOHN TOOK HIS OWN LIFE. WE WERE SHOCKED AT THE SAME TIME THERE WERE SIGNS. SIGNS THAT COULD HAVE AND SHOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED. I KNOW I COULD HAVE DONE TO SUPPORT I KNOW I COULD HAVE DONE BETTER TO SUPPORT JOHN INSIDE STAFF HAD BEEN GIVEN THAT KNOWLEDGE AND EDUCATION. IF TEACHERS HAD BEEN ABLE TO RECOGNIZE THE SIGNS. AND NOW I'M HERE BECAUSE SB TREAT SEVEN IS MY CHANCE. IT'S OUR CHANCE. TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES AND TRAINING ON HOW TO HANDLE MENTAL HEALTH CRISES. BUT ALSO TO HELP EACH OTHER AS TEACHERS BECAUSE TEACHERS FACE THEIR OWN MENTAL HEALTH CONCERNS TO. SPEAKING ABOUT MENTAL HEALTH AND REMOVING THE STIGMA AT SCHOOL IS THE ONLY WAY THAT WE ARE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN TURNING THE TIDE IN SUPPORT OF HEALTH AND WELLBEING THIRTY SECONDS DISTRICTS ACROSS THE STATE HAVE MADE STRIDES. IN SUPPORTING PROGRAMS THAT ADVOCATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH. AS A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER I CAN PERSONALLY ATTEST TO OUR EXCITEMENT THE NEW RESOURCES. THAT ARE FINALLY DEDICATED. BUT IT'S TIME TO GO A STEP FURTHER AND PREPARE OUR TEACHERS AND STAFF.

YOU KNOW WHEN I'M NOT GOING AWAY THIS ISSUE ISN'T GOING AWAY AND WILL WORK OUT WHATEVER WE NEED TO WORK OUT WITH THE IMPLEMENTATION OF IT- TO MAKE IT A STRONG AND IT'S BURDEN AS POSSIBLE BUT EVERY DAY WE DON'T HELP OUR KIDS.

I DO HAVE A CONCERN TO OR LOCAL SCHOOLWORK IN GIVING OUR SOURCE WILL DISTRICTS YOU IMPLEMENT AN I WAS CURIOUS AND FRONT ARE THERE ANY CONSIDER ANY DISCUSS ON WHETHER OR NOT THEY WOULD BE. GRANTED A LOCAL WORSE DISTRICTS YOU ABLE TO THIS- YES- IS TRAINING. CENTERPOINT AT WITH THE CHAIRS PLEASE. NO MY IS TO HAVE IT FOR WITHIN THE BY AS WELL- BUT I RECOGNIZE THERE'S GOING TO BE DISH- FINING CROSS- AT I- AM HOPEFUL THAT THE BILL GETTING THROUGH THIS IS LAYS FOUNDATION FOR BY OUT. FOR MEDIVATION ANY UP ON THE PLEASE THANK MA'AM BYE CHAIR AT ITS CHRISTIAN PAN THE CENTER ON THE CENTER MORE THANK YOU I WANT TO SAN FOURTEEN FOR HIS LEADERS AND ISSUE. HE WAS A PARTNER WITH ME BACK IN TWENTY NINETEEN WHEN I AUTHORED A BILL WHICH UNFORTUNATELY GOT THE VETOED BY THE GOVERNOR BUT I APPRECIATE THAT HE'S TAKEN UP THE MANTLE AND- HS MOVED FORWARD BOTH HIS PREVIOUS LEGISLATION WHICH IS NOW LAW BUT THEN ALSO AGAIN COMING BACK TO US TODAY TO SAY THAT WE NEED. MORE TEACHERS WHO ARE TRAINED- TO IDENTIFY MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND THAT AND I ALSO WANT JUST EMPHASIZING I REALLY APPRECIATE CENTER PORTANTINO BRING UP THIS WE'RE NOT EXPECTING SCHOOL STAFF AND TEACHERS. TO BECOME MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS- IN FACT WE NEED TO WORK TO BE SURE THAT WE FUND THE MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS UNNECESSARY PROVIDE THE CARE FOR. THE STUDENTS THE CHILDREN. WHO ARE NOTIFIED BY THE TEACHERS. AND IN FACT I THINK IN THE LAST BUDGET WE BUDGETED UP FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR YOUTH MENTAL HEALTH- WOULD BE PERHAPS WE'LL SEE WHETHER WE MIGHT NEED TO DO MORE. BUT WE OF COURSE NEED TO BUILD UP THE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH WORKFORCE AS WELL. BUT HIS CENTER PORTANTINO SAID WE ALSO NEED TO BE SURE OF THAT- THE PEOPLE ON THE FRONT LINES AND THAT'S WHERE TEACHERS ARE THERE ON THE FRONT LINES AND I KNOW THEY'RE VERY BUSY HAND THEY'RE STRESSED. AND PERHAPS EVEN CELLS COULD USE A MENTAL SUPPORT TO BECAUSE OF THE STRESS THAT THEY HAVE. SO WE NEED TO THINK AND TALK ABOUT THAT TOO- BUT THAT THEY ARE ABLE TO IDENTIFY THE STUDENTS WHO ARE IN NEED AND- I MEAN THIS WAS A PROBLEM BEFORE COPAYS. IT'S JUST GOTTEN WORSE. MUCH WORSE WITH CODED. AND I WOULD ALSO WANT TO POINT OUT THAT- SHE DOES A STUDY PUBLISHED IN PEDIATRICS THAT LOOKED AT- JUST TO JUST GET A SENSE OF THE MAGNITUDE- THAT ESTIMATED THAT AS OF LAST JUNE- WE'VE HAD A HUNDRED FORTY THOUSAND CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY WHO HAVE LOST A PARENT OR GRANDPARENT CAREGIVER. SO JUST TALK ABOUT LOSS IN THAT AND THAT'S JUST THE SUB SEGMENT. IN FACT IT'S ESTIMATED THAT- BUT PROBABLY OVER A HUNDRED EIGHTY THOUSAND. CHILDREN WHO HAVE LOST A PRIMARY CRE YOU KNOW THE SIGNIFICANCE CARE GIVER PARENT OR GRANDPARENT PRIMARY CARE GIVER. AND SO TO THINK ABOUT THE MENTAL HEALTH BURDENS- DEAD BATTERY REPRESENTS BUT THEN WE CAN THINK ABOUT ALL THE OTHER. CHILDREN AS WELL WHO ARE FACING WHETHER. IT'S A RELATIVE- THEIR SOCIAL CIRCUMSTANCES AND SO FORTH TO THE TREMENDOUS NEED FOR THIS BILL WE HAVE A TREMENDOUS NEED FOR MORE OF OUR SCHOOL STAFF. I ALSO APPRECIATE THAT OUR VICE CHAIRS QUESTION BECAUSE WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS HAVE THE SUPPORT. THAT THEY NEED BECAUSE THERE IS SPENDING A LOT NOT ONLY TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EDUCATE OUR KIDS BUT IT'S IN PERSON OR REMOTELY. BUT ALSO SPENDING OUR MONEY ON COPING CONTROLLED WE SURE SCHOOLS ARE SAFE AND WE NEED TO HELP THEM OUT THERE BY PASSING POLICIES TO HELP TEACHERS SCHOOLS ARE SAFE. AND THEN OF COURSE ON TOP OF THAT TO BE SURE THEY CAN MEET OUR CHILDREN'S NEEDS. TO DEVELOP THAT FIVE MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND OF COURSE ALSO ONE POINT OUT THAT A CHILD WITH A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THAT'S AN- INDEMNIFIED AND UNMANAGED. IS ALSO THE STUDENT WHO PROBABLY ISN'T LEARNING VERY WELL IN SCHOOL ANYWAY. SO IT IS PART OF THE EDUCATIONAL MISSION I BELIEVE OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND TEACHERS TO IDENTIFY CHILDREN WITH MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES AND. WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT THEY ARE TRAINED TO DO SO WITH THAT- AND- REALLY APPRECIATE LEADERSHIP CENTER PORTANTINO- REALLY APPRECIATE THAT I DIDN'T ACTUALLY HAVE TO PRESENT THE BILL BECAUSE HE'S MUCH MORE ELOQUENT THAN I AM- BUT CERTAINLY IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT OF THE BILL. AND AND DOES THAT AND REALLY- HOPE THAT WE CAN HAVE UNANIMOUS VOTE FOR THIS BILL COMING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE THANK YOU.

THANKS VERY MUCH AND CENTER ALLEN I DO APPRECIATE YOU BRINGING THIS BILL FORWARD AND CERTAINLY. AND AS WE'RE DEALING THE CODE CRISIS AND- UNCERTAINTY REGARDIG ENROLLMENT- DO WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT. I GUESS IT TOO QUESTIONS PERHAPS YOU CAN ADDRESS- SO. TO ONE IS THAT- HOW DOES THIS BILL CORRESPOND TO WHAT THE GOVERNOR PROPOSED IN THE BUDGET IN TERMS OF. HOW TO ADDRESS- THE- IN TERMS OF- FUND THE SCHOOL FUNDING SO ON JUST ONE TO KNOW IF THERE ARE- HOW THIS BILL AND PUT GOVERNOR PROPOSED COUNTY CORRESPOND OR NOT CORRESPOND. AND IN THE SECOND QUESTION IS THAT. FIVE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THAT- THAT NOW THERE'S A NEED FOR THIS- BUT ALSO MAKE NOTE THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT YOU KNOW THE- THIS GUMMIES I GUESS THE THIRD YEAR HI FINANCIALLY. AT SOME POINT WE GOTTA FIGURE A START HAVING SOME CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO. NOTE SO WE GOT FREEZER FOREVER OR WE GONNA FIND SOME AND YES WE ARE TO BILLS COOK OF THE CRISIS AND THERE'S A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY SO I GET THAT. SO IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL BUT WE ALSO NEED TO START HAVING SOME KIND OF CONVERSATION ABOUT WHAT IS THE- ESSENTIALLY THE OFF RAMP. TO THIS THAT CAN DEBT THAT WOULD REFLECT- STILL WE CAN RESET YOUR HOW TO BE STABLE- THE FINANCING SO- YOU KNOW YOU HAVE SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE GROWING YOUR SCHOOL OTHER SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE SHRINKING. WE'RE NOT SURE WHETHER TO GROWING L. SOME BECAUSE THIS BILL MOVEMENT PEOPLE IN THE STATE. CLEARLY WE HAVE ISSUES IN TERMS OF ROMAN BECAUSE OF COVETED OF THAT SORT OF THE- THE PART THAT THEY ARE THE WILD CARDS THAT WERE STUDENTS SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE DEALING WITH MOST IMPORTANTLY. THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH BUT EVENTUALLY AT SOME POINT IN TIME WE'VE GOT TO FIGURE OUT WHAT THE OFFRAMP IS SO. PERHAPS YOU CAN ALSO TOUCH ON. A WELCOME DISCUSSIONS ARE TAKING PLACE TO DATE THAT YOU'RE AWARE OF OR IF THERE ARE CONVERSATIONS THAT- WE'RE ENGAGING IN IN TERMS OF. FIGURING OUT SOME KIND OF AN OFF RAMP SO THAT WE'RE JUST NOT. EXTENDING THIS YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR. BECAUSE YOU KNOW THE MORE YEARS IT'S EXTENDED THE MORE CHALLENGING GETS AND ALSO THE MORE. YOU KNOW THIRTY FRANK YOU CAN ADD THAT- YOURS ARE FREEZING SOMETHING IN PLACE THAT OVER TIME MAY CAUSE MORE PROBLEMS AS WELL SO. AGAIN SUPPORTING THIS BILL TODAY IT'S A NECESSARY THING WE NEED TO DO BUT WE ALSO AND THIS BEING YOUR THREE WE NEED TO START HAVING THOSE CONVERSATIONS. WELL VERY MUCH A- THE- CENTER. I'M I WAS THE- DID SOMETHING OUT ABOUT A THREE YEAR ROLLING EDA AVERAGE ON THE SCHOOL FUNDING BUT OF COURSE. NOTHING IS CONFIRMED- THAT'S JUST HIS PROPOSAL RIGHT- SO FOR US I THINK THE IDEA IS THAT THE EXTENDING HOLD HARMLESS REMAINS AN IMPORTANT NEAR FUTURE SOLUTION TO GIVE SCHOOLS- SOME CERTAINTY AS THEY PLAN THEIR FINANCES IN THEIR PROGRAMS- BUT- YOU KNOW I RESERVE RESPECT I. I GUESS I WOULD TURN IT BACK TO YOU AS A RESIDENT IMMUNOLOGIST- ARE YOU THIS IS ALL ABOUT BECAUSE OF IT RIGHT I MEAN I YOU KNOW. I TOTALLY I WOULD NEVER BRING A BILL LIKE THIS BOARD. IF WE SAW- IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE PANDEMIC RIGHT AND WHAT WE DID THE PANDEMIC IT JUST REEKS. HAVOC ON ENROLLMENT. PROJECTIONS NUMBERS- IT'S SO DIFFICULT FOR SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT'S HAPPENING BUT THERE'S NO QUESTION THIS OUGHT TO BE IS SOMETHING THAT THE THIS COMMITTEE DISCUSSES THE STUDENT SUCCESS LET COMMITTEE- THE BUDGET SUB I MEAN THAT YOU KNOW THAT THIS IS ARE WE GOTTA GET OUR HANDS AROUND I GUESS I. THE HOPE CONTINUES TO BEING THAT WE GET. THAT THE BY AND BY THE TIME BY BY NEXT YEAR- WHAT WE WILL HAVE A MUCH BETTER SENSE OF WHERE. THIS IS ALL GOING AND NOT NOT ONLY AND YOU. HAVE ANY LOGICALLY SOCIETALLY AND THEN AND THEN OF COURSE. WHAT THAT MEANS FOR SCHOOL DISTRICT ENROLLMENT- I MEAN FROM MY PERSPECTIVE I IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU AGREE THIS IS THIS IS JUST A WISE. WAY FOR US TO JUST CONTINUE WITH THE FUNDING AS OTHERWISE BECAUSE WE ALL KNOW THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. CONTINUE TO HAVE ENORMOUS- CHALLENGES IS KEEPING YOUR KEEPING THE PROGRAM STRONG AND LIGHTS ON- AND AS WE TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THIS IS GOING AND WHAT IMPACT IT'S GOING TO HAVE IN A ROMAN. BUT I YOU KNOW I LOVE I MEAN I THINK THAT IT. YES I WOULD JUST SUGGEST THAT THIS IS SOMETHING THAT THIS COMMITTEE OUGHT TO SPEND SOME TIME LOOKING OUT IN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE BUDGET SEVEN I LOVE YOU FOR THIS DISCUSSION. OKAY SO I APPRECIATE THE A BECAUSE YOU'RE THE AUTHOR OF THE VEHICLE FOR APPS THAT WE CAN HAVE SOME OF THIS QUESTION ABOUT SO- APPRECIATE YOUR- THAT YOUR LEADERSHIP. AND- ADDRESSING THIS CARD IS COATED IN- WE- THE IN. IS IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. TO PASS POLICY TO ENSURE KIDS ARE. AT SCHOOL BECAUSE PART OF THE- PARENTS AREN'T ROLLING TO. YOU KNOW THE BIG IMPACT. AND SO IT'S A- THAT WE- THE POLICY. SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE CONFIDENCE. WHEN THE KIDS ARE IN SCHOOL THEY'RE SAFE. AND SO THAT'S GOING TO BE ANOTHER CERTAINLY WORK FOR US AS WELL HOPEFULLY PROVIDING MORE CERTAINTY THERE FOR TWO SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN THE FUTURE. BUT I ALSO JUST WANTED A KNOWLEDGE THE SAP ANALYSIS WHERE- WELL WE ARE TRYING TO DEAL IN THE KEEP SITUATION IN THE LONG TERM WE ALSO NOT. NOT NEED TO THINK ABOUT. IT WILL LIKELY A FISCAL CLIFF AND WHERE PEOPLE ARE AFRAID TO SAY WELL. WE'LL GET THIS FREEZE THINGS BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID THE FISCAL CLIFF SO WE YOU KNOW THE LONGER DRAGS OUT THE MORE CHALLENGING AS SO. BUT IF. YOU'RE LEADERSHIP AND BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL AT THIS POINT IN TIME THANK YOU THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER PAN CENTER PAN HAS A MOTION ON THE FLOOR WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE WITH COMMITTEE CONVERSATION WE HAVE. THE VICE CHAIR THAN CENTER DAHLE IN CENTER GLAZER MEADOW VICE CHAIR THE FLOOR IS YOURS. THE SIDE. HERE THANK YOU SO MUCH SIR DOLLARS. THE FOR YOUR CENTER DOLLARS THANK YOU CAN YOU HEAR ME OK THERE WE GOTTA COME INTO LINE KLINGBERG. SO FIRST OFF I JUST WANT TO SAY I'M- YOU KNOW I'VE VOTED FOR- AUSPICES IN THE LAST COUPLE OF CYCLES BUT TIGHT. I'VE ALSO BEEN DOING SOME HOMEWORK BEEN TALKING TO- AT LEAST IN MY DISTRICT THE SUPERINTENDENT OF SCHOOLS AND ALSO BEEN TALKING TO- PARENTS AND TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS REALLY HAPPENING OUT THERE IS IT AND I I'M TRYING TO BE A SPRINGBOARD OFF OF. US SENATOR PAN'S QUESTIONS- AND I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A DEEPER CONVERSATION AND JUST CONTINUING TO- YOU KNOW FIND. ADA AT THE LEVEL IT WAS PRIOR TO THE PANDEMIC. IN THAT WHY SAY THAT IS THAT I DON'T BELIEVE IN THIS BILL WE DON'T TAKE CARE CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND A LOT OF THE DISTRICTS THAT- I REPRESENT. A LOT OF THEIR STUDENTS LEFT NOT BECAUSE OF. THE PANDEMIC IN BEING SAFE. BECAUSE OF THE POLICIES OF HOW THEY WERE CHILDREN ARE BEING TAUGHT. AND I THINK THAT WE SEE THAT IN. THE LA UNIFIED WERE- YOU KNOW YOU CAN YOU TO ALLOW- EIGHTY EIGHT FUNDS TO COME IN AND WE DON'T REALLY TRACK WHERE THE KIDS ARE GOING AND WHY THEY'RE GOING WHERE THEY'RE GOING SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE A CONVERSATION. WITH A LONGER WE CONTINUE TO MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION- WE'RE GONNA REALLY BE SOME SCHOOLS PEOPLE ARE MOVING TO BECAUSE THEIR POLICIES ARE DIFFERENT ABOUT HOW THEY- TAKE CARE OF COKE WHICH SO I HAVE MY ACTUAL QUESTION IS THIS. I'M GONNA LAY OUT THE BILL TODAY- I KNOW THE LOT OF MY SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN FAVOR OF IT THAT- THAT OF STATE OPEN AND DONE I THINK A GREAT GREAT JOB IN SOME OF THAT. THAT YOU KNOW HAVE INCREASED IN EIGHTY EIGHT BECAUSE THEIR POLICIES ARE DIFFERENT TO- NEED TO THEIR ADHD EXPANDED. AND I WOULD LIKE THAT CENTER TALK ABOUT. CHARTER SCHOOLS IF YOU COULD IN WHITES NOT ADDRESSED IN THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. ALLENDORF FOR CENTER. QUESTION PLEASE WHAT WILL FIRST ALL IT'S INCORRECT TO SAY WITH DOESN'T COVER CHARGE SCHOOL IT DOES GOING FORWARD THE ISSUE IS HAS TO DO WITH THE FUNDING MECHANISM FOR CHARTER SCHOOLS. AS IT RELATES TO THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY ONE. AND TRY TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR. AND YOU KNOW I GUESS THERE WAS A- I MET WITH HER SCHOOL FOLKS YESTERDAY. AND THEY HAD A PROPOSAL FOR SOME LANGUAGE AND IT TURNS OUT THERE IS A BATTLE THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING OVER THIS-FINANCING- AS IT RELATES TO- AT THE THAT'S BEEN HAPPENING HERE IN THIS COMMITTEE- AND YOU KNOW THAT IT HAPPENED I GUESS AFTER I LEFT THE TERM AND AFTER I LEFT THE COMMITTEE. SO WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO TALK TO THEM WORK WITH THEM IN ORDER TO COMMITTEE STAFF TRY TO SEE IF WE CAN FIGURE OUT A WAY TO. TO MEET THEIR CONCERNS- YOU KNOW BUT IT THE ABSOLUTELY INCLUDES THEM GOING ON A GOING FORWARD BASIS THE ISSUE THAT JUST CAME OUT YESTERDAY FOR ME HAS TO DO. WITH THIS FUNDING MECHANISM AS IT RELATES TO THIS SCHOOL YEAR. AND- YEAH WE JUST GOT A NOTE FROM YOUR STAFF. LEO YESTERDAY EVENING AND WE'RE JUST GONNA HAVE TO WE'RE GOING TO SPEND SOME TIME WORKING ON THIS- WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND CERTAINLY INVITE YOUR PARTICIPATION SENATOR. SENATE ONLY A THIRD VICTIM I APPRECIATE THAT AND I ALWAYS LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON VERY THOUGHTFUL AND TOUGH ISSUES THIS IS NOT EASY- BUT I THINK EVERYBODY NEEDS WITH THE TABLE AND I'LL BE LOOKING FORWARD TO AGAIN I'M A LAY OUT THE BILL TODAY BUT I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TRYING TO COME UP WITH. SOMETHING THAT WE JUST DON'T PUSH THIS THROUGH AND WE DO WHAT WE'VE BEEN DOING WE NEED OUT. ACTUAL CONVERSATIONS A BIGGER OUT. WHY WHY THE STUDENTS ARE GOING WHERE THEY ARE A LOT OF. CHARTER SCHOOLS- GROUP WERE GROWING. AT A FAST PACE FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS WEREN'T BECAUSE THEY WERE JUST OPEN AT THE TIME NOW THAT COULD BE A DIFFERENT CASE NOW THAT WAS THAT TWO YEARS AGO. AND HERE WE ARE THE THIRD YEAR SO LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONVERSATION WITH YOU. SENATOR ALAN. THANK YOU FOR THE SENATE. THANK YOU SO MUCH SEVEN DOLLARS FOR YOUR COMMENTS DISCONTENT GLAZER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. TIED TO- TWO COMMENTS ONE IS BUT- I DO ALSO APPRECIATE THE- POINTS THAT WERE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS THAT SENATOR PAN SPOKE TO. AND YOU KNOW IT'S HARD TO BE A SCHOOL BOARD MEMBER THESE DAYS AND THAT NONE OF US HAVE CRYSTAL BALLS- BUT I WILL SAY THAT BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC EVER HAPPENED WE HAD SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT WERE. ON THE BORDER OF BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE THEY- REFUSED TO MAKE THE HARD DECISIONS THAT WERE NECESSARY FOR A VARIETY OF BUDGETARY REASONS. NOT JUST ABOUT ENROLLMENT HELLO THAT CERTAINLY IS A- IS A DOMINANT ONE AND THIS COMMITTEE DOESN'T REALLY GET TO. HEAR THESE TYPES OF ISSUES BECAUSE THEY'RE HEARD IN BUDGET- EVEN OTHER IMPLICATIONS FOR EDUCATION ARE ENORMOUS. AND SO. I JUST WANT TO. PUT A- IN IN THAT POINT BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A GOOD ONE- I WOULD I DO WANT TO ADDRESS THE ISSUE OF CHARTER SCHOOLS HERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW WE WE'VE HAD BATTLES OVER MANY DECADES REALLY IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL PUBLIC SCHOOL SPACE- AND- YOU KNOW A PART OF. PEACE IN THE SPACES EQUITY. THAT THAT THE PEOPLE THAT THE UNITS THAT THAT THERE'S FAIRNESS. AND WE HAD SOME PRETTY TOUGH BILLS A COUPLE YEARS AGO THAT USE THAT POINT EXACTLY TO BE CONCERNING CRITICAL UP OF THE PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND THEN YOU GET A SITUATION LIKE. TO REPRESENTED IN THIS BILL ABOUT FUNDING AND THAT'S A VERY SERIOUS YOU KNOW.
