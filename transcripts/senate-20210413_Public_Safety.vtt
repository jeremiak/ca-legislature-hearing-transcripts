ONLY TO BE HIRED BY THE CITY OF

00:09:09.682 --> 00:09:11.150
IN CALIFORNIA STATE THEIR

00:09:11.217 --> 00:09:13.452

COMMUNITY HAVING ADVOCATES

00:09:20.459 --> 00:09:22.695
RECOGNIZE AND AGREE. THAT THIS

00:09:22.762 --> 00:09:24.263
IS A PROBLEM HOWEVER WE ALSO

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:25.998
MUST RECOGNIZE THAT THE CURRENT

00:09:26.065 --> 00:09:28.935
SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY IS

00:09:29.001 --> 00:09:30.803
INSUFFICIENT. UNITY'S KNOW WHO

00:09:30.870 --> 00:09:33.105
THE BAD OFFICERS ARE BETTER IN

00:09:33.172 --> 00:09:34.707
THEIR- IN THEIR LOCAL

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:36.142
DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE MANY OF

00:09:36.208 --> 00:09:37.243
THEM ARE SIGNED TO BLACK AND

00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:38.811
BROWN COMMUNITIES OR

00:09:38.878 --> 00:09:40.780
COMMUNITIES OF LOW INCOME. IT

00:09:40.846 --> 00:09:43.449
IS SO RARE THAT THESE OFFICERS

00:09:43.516 --> 00:09:44.951
ARE HELD ACCOUNTABLE IN COURT

00:09:45.017 --> 00:09:46.619
OR HELD ACCOUNTABLE BY THEIR

00:09:46.686 --> 00:09:48.721

00:09:48.788 --> 00:09:50.690
ACCOUNTABLE THIS WILL BE. BILL

00:09:50.756 --> 00:09:51.958

OFFICERS WILL NOT TAKE THIS

00:09:53.826 --> 00:09:54.894
MISCONDUCT TO ANOTHER

00:09:54.961 --> 00:09:57.897
DEPARTMENT IN ANOTHER COMMUNITY.

00:09:57.964 --> 00:10:00.132
FAR TOO OFTEN THESE GUYS GO TO

00:10:00.199 --> 00:10:02.535
THE SMALLER- DEPARTMENT WE DO

00:10:02.601 --> 00:10:04.804
NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO ALLEN

00:10:04.870 --> 00:10:06.939
ACADEMY AND- TRAIN THEIR OWN

00:10:07.006 --> 00:10:09.008
OFFICERS SO THERE I WILL GLADLY

00:10:09.075 --> 00:10:10.076
TAKE OFFICERS WHO HAVE COME

00:10:10.142 --> 00:10:11.377
FROM A BIGGER DEPARTMENT

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:12.945
DESPITE THEIR BACKGROUND IN

00:10:13.012 --> 00:10:15.181
HISTORY. THIS IS DOROTHY IS

00:10:15.247 --> 00:10:16.682
IMPORTANT TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:18.417

BOARD WITHIN POLLS THAT WOULD

00:10:23.823 --> 00:10:25.524
MAKE INITIAL RECOMMENDATIONS ON

00:10:25.591 --> 00:10:27.593
WHETHER POST SHOULD DECERTIFY

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.894
AN OFFICER AND FINALLY THIS

00:10:28.961 --> 00:10:30.396
BILL ALLOWS THE COMMISSION TO

00:10:30.463 --> 00:10:32.465

WHEN AN OFFICER ACTS IN A WAY

THAT WOULD ESTABLISH A NEW

00:37:02.753 --> 00:37:04.822
LICENSING PROCESS. THE TRUTH IS

00:37:04.889 --> 00:37:06.424
THAT S. B. T. REACHES FAR

00:37:06.490 --> 00:37:08.059

WE WILL FIND THE GREATEST

00:37:22.373 --> 00:37:24.175

00:49:55.692 --> 00:50:02.399
DECISIONS OR- ACTIONS. THE

00:50:02.466 --> 00:50:04.668
SPEAK TO SPECIFIC TIME BUT IT

00:50:04.735 --> 00:50:06.436
IS OUR HOPES THAT THIS WILL BE

00:50:06.503 --> 00:50:07.938
A EXPEDITED PROCESS THAT MAKES

00:50:08.004 --> 00:50:09.473
IT FAIR TO THE MEN AND WOMEN

00:50:09.539 --> 00:50:10.974
WHO ARE BEING INVESTIGATED NO

00:50:11.041 --> 00:50:13.310
ONE WANTS TO PROLONG THIS SAME

00:50:13.377 --> 00:50:15.912
TIME- WE WANT. JUSTICE TO BE

00:50:15.979 --> 00:50:17.647
BROUGHT FOR THOSE FAMILIES WHO

00:50:17.714 --> 00:50:19.683
HAVE CONCERNS AS TO THE CONDUCT

00:50:19.750 --> 00:50:21.918
THAT IS UNDER REVIEW SO- IT

00:50:21.985 --> 00:50:23.854
DIDN'T SPEAK SPECIFICALLY TO

00:50:23.920 --> 00:50:26.390
TALK BUT- BERMAN HE IS IN AN-

00:50:26.456 --> 00:50:28.191
EXPEDITING THIS PROCESS IS.

00:50:28.258 --> 00:50:30.494
THIS TO ALL OF OUR BEST

00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:36.333
ADVANTAGE. THE- OPPOSITION

00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:37.601
TALKED A LOT ABOUT THIS BEING

00:50:37.667 --> 00:50:39.302
DETRIMENTAL TO CITIES AND

00:50:39.369 --> 00:50:42.272
COUNTIES AND- THE COST OPENING

00:50:42.339 --> 00:50:46.343
THE FLOODGATES FOR- LAWSUITS-

00:50:46.410 --> 00:50:49.579
BUT ALSO I THINK WHAT'S MAYBE

00:50:49.646 --> 00:50:51.415
NOT WHAT WASN'T MENTIONED IS

00:50:51.481 --> 00:50:53.250
THAT THERE ARE ALREADY TONS OF

00:50:53.316 --> 00:50:55.485
COSTS THAT ARE LEVIED ON CITIES

00:50:55.552 --> 00:50:57.554
AND COUNTIES I WITH REGARDS TO

00:50:57.621 --> 00:50:59.256
THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS

00:50:59.322 --> 00:51:01.458
AGAINST- ROGUE LAW

00:51:01.525 --> 00:51:03.927
ENFORCEMENT'S WHICH RESULT IN

00:51:03.994 --> 00:51:06.229
TENS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS AND

00:51:06.296 --> 00:51:08.632
LAWSUITS. AND SO I DON'T KNOW

00:51:08.698 --> 00:51:10.300
I'M SURE YOU CAN SPEAK TO IT

00:51:10.367 --> 00:51:11.902
BUT MAYBE THE OPPOSITION CAN

00:51:11.968 --> 00:51:13.603
CAN SPEAK TO THE FACT THAT THAT

00:51:13.670 --> 00:51:15.472
ALSO CURRENTLY GOES ON AND

00:51:15.539 --> 00:51:19.176
WOULDN'T WE WANT- POLICY THAT

00:51:19.242 --> 00:51:21.144
WOULD ACTUALLY ALLOW. FOR

00:51:21.211 --> 00:51:22.679
CITIES AND COUNTIES TO NOT HAVE

00:51:22.746 --> 00:51:26.550
TO PAY OUT- THOSE- FEET THOSE

00:51:26.616 --> 00:51:29.519
COSTS THOSE SETTLEMENT COSTS-

00:51:29.586 --> 00:51:31.688
USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS- BY

00:51:31.755 --> 00:51:33.256
COMING UP WITH A POLICY THAT

00:51:33.323 --> 00:51:34.724
WOULD ALLOW US TO.

00:51:34.791 --> 00:51:36.726
EXPEDITIOUSLY LOOK INTO THIS

00:51:36.793 --> 00:51:38.628
KIND OF MISCONDUCT AND PROVES

00:51:38.695 --> 00:51:39.729
THAT PREVENTS CITIES AND

00:51:39.796 --> 00:51:42.632
COUNTIES FROM HAVING TO DEAL

00:51:42.699 --> 00:51:43.633
WITH THESE KINDS OF LAWSUITS.

00:51:43.700 --> 00:51:46.470
IF ON THE I. VISION TO BUT I

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:48.605
WOULD LOVE FOR THEM TO MENTION

00:51:48.672 --> 00:51:52.609
TO TALK ABOUT THIS. YEAH-

00:51:52.676 --> 00:51:54.211
SENATOR COMMODITY JONATHON

00:51:54.277 --> 00:51:55.479
FELDMAN WITH THE POLICE CHIEF

00:51:55.545 --> 00:51:57.247
THANK YOU FOR THE QUESTION. I

00:51:57.314 --> 00:51:59.115
THINK AGAIN THERE IS A LOT OF

00:51:59.182 --> 00:52:01.618
AGREEMENT- THAT REMOVING BAD

00:52:01.685 --> 00:52:04.187
OFFICERS HAS THAT BENEFITS NOT

00:52:04.254 --> 00:52:05.989
JUST FOR THE COMMUNITIES AND

00:52:06.056 --> 00:52:06.857
THOSE THAT THEY COULD

00:52:06.923 --> 00:52:08.024
POTENTIALLY BE USED BUT ALSO

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.426
FOR THE CITIES ARE NO LONGER

00:52:09.493 --> 00:52:11.461
LIABLE FOR THE BAD OFFICERS.

00:52:11.528 --> 00:52:11.995
THAT'S WHY WE AGREE WITH

00:52:12.062 --> 00:52:14.130
GETTING RID OF THEM. WHAT WE

00:52:14.197 --> 00:52:15.899
HAVE CONCERNS WITH IS CHANGES

00:52:15.966 --> 00:52:17.434
TO THE CIVIL LIABILITY STATUTES

00:52:17.501 --> 00:52:19.636
THAT LOWER THE STANDARDS TO A

00:52:19.703 --> 00:52:22.272
POINT THAT. WE BELIEVE IT IS

00:52:22.339 --> 00:52:25.008
DETRIMENTAL. A STANDARD THAT'S

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.243
BLOWN UP SAID IN AN OFFICER

00:52:26.309 --> 00:52:28.945
ACTION SPLIT SECOND COULD STILL

00:52:29.012 --> 00:52:30.080
POTENTIALLY BE CIVILLY LIABLE

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.147
FOR THAT THAT'S NOT TO SAY THAT

00:52:31.214 --> 00:52:32.616
IT WILL COMPLETELY CLOSED OFF

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:34.518
TO THE IDEAS OF CHANGING YOU

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:35.719
KNOW THE SPECIFIC INTENT

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:38.255
STANDARD WITHIN THE BANNACK-

00:52:38.321 --> 00:52:39.956
BUT THE STANDARD PUT IN PLACE

00:52:40.023 --> 00:52:42.025
CURRENTLY. WE HAVE CONCERNS

00:52:42.092 --> 00:52:43.660
THAT AS WITH THE CITIES WHICH

00:52:43.727 --> 00:52:45.262
NOTED BY THE WITNESS TO TESTIFY

00:52:45.328 --> 00:52:48.398
AT FIRST- INCLUDES OTHER

00:52:48.465 --> 00:52:52.869
PUBLIC- EMPLOYEES. OPERATING A

00:52:52.936 --> 00:52:55.505
THEIR COULD THE PROFESSIONAL.

00:52:55.572 --> 00:52:57.841
HUH WELL YOU ALSO MENTIONED

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.309
THAT DUE PROCESS WOULD BE

00:52:59.376 --> 00:53:01.211
COMPROMISED AS A RESULT OF THIS

00:53:01.278 --> 00:53:02.646
AND MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT

00:53:02.712 --> 00:53:04.014
DECERTIFICATION STILL OFFERS

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.550
FULL AND FAIR DUE PROCESS PRIOR

00:53:06.616 --> 00:53:08.485
TO ANY ADVERSE ACTION. DO YOU

00:53:08.552 --> 00:53:13.990
AGREE WITH THAT. THAT I WOULD

00:53:14.057 --> 00:53:16.860
SAY YOU KNOW WE HAVE LOOKS LIKE

00:53:16.927 --> 00:53:18.328
TWO TRACKS UNDER THE BILL WE

00:53:18.395 --> 00:53:20.797
HAVE THE LOCAL AGENCIES AND THE

00:53:20.864 --> 00:53:22.599
LOCAL PROCESS AS BARGAINED WITH

00:53:22.666 --> 00:53:25.201
THEIR PUBLIC EMPLOYEE UNIONS.

00:53:25.268 --> 00:53:27.170
PRODUCE CROSSES INTO THE REVIEW

00:53:27.237 --> 00:53:29.072
OF THEIR CONDUCT AND EDUCATION

00:53:29.139 --> 00:53:30.607
THURMOND WHICH COULD INCLUDE IN

00:53:30.674 --> 00:53:32.976
A COURT OF APPEALS- AND THEN WE

00:53:33.043 --> 00:53:34.945
HAVE A SEPARATE PROCESS LAID ON

00:53:35.011 --> 00:53:36.279
TOP OF THAT WE OPPOSE COULD

00:53:36.346 --> 00:53:37.280
LOOK INTO IT EVEN IF THEY'VE

00:53:37.347 --> 00:53:38.815
ALREADY GONE THROUGH THE FIRST

00:53:38.882 --> 00:53:40.216
LOCAL PROCESS AND BEEN FOUND

00:53:40.283 --> 00:53:41.518
YOU KNOW EITHER AND SUSTAINED

00:53:41.585 --> 00:53:43.386
EXONERATED. BY THE COMPLETED

00:53:43.453 --> 00:53:45.555
BEEN FOUNDED BY THEY COULD BE

00:53:45.622 --> 00:53:48.191
RETRIED BY POST UNTIL DECEMBER

00:53:48.258 --> 00:53:49.859
ALJ THAT ADMINISTRATIVE LAW

00:53:49.926 --> 00:53:52.295
JUDGE RUBIO- AND THEN FOUND

00:53:52.362 --> 00:53:53.730
GUILTY AND THAT'S WHERE WE TALK

00:53:53.797 --> 00:53:55.799
AND WE TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW THE

00:53:55.865 --> 00:53:56.633
DOUBLE JEOPARDY OR CONCERNED

00:53:56.700 --> 00:53:58.735
WITH- YOU KNOW BEING TRIED

00:53:58.802 --> 00:54:01.137
TWICE THAT'S WHERE THE CONCERN

00:54:01.204 --> 00:54:05.976
COMES. FROM THE FACT THAT THERE

00:54:06.042 --> 00:54:07.477
ARE TWO SEPARATE. SIMILAR TO

00:54:07.544 --> 00:54:10.113
THIS PROCESSES COULD BE. WOULD

00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:10.714
RATHER SEE ONE STREAM PROCESS

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:12.749
THAT I DON'T. THE OFFICE WHO

00:54:12.816 --> 00:54:13.683
ARE GUILTY OF MISCONDUCT THE

00:54:13.750 --> 00:54:18.588
NUMBER THAT. I THINK IT ALLOWS

00:54:18.655 --> 00:54:20.757
FOR- INVESTIGATION AND FULL

00:54:20.824 --> 00:54:23.927
TRANSPARENCY. WHICH I THINK IS

00:54:23.994 --> 00:54:26.463
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT-

00:54:26.529 --> 00:54:28.898
YOU ALSO LAST QUESTION MADAM

00:54:28.965 --> 00:54:31.067
CHAIR IF YOU WOULD INDULGE ME

00:54:31.134 --> 00:54:34.904
IS THAT I ROMS. I RECOGNIZE THE

00:54:34.971 --> 00:54:37.240
FACT THAT EVERYONE WHO SPOKE IN

00:54:37.307 --> 00:54:39.476
OPPOSITION THE KEY WITNESSES

00:54:39.542 --> 00:54:40.543
SAID THAT IT IS REALLY

00:54:40.610 --> 00:54:43.613
IMPORTANT TO GET RID OF THOSE-

00:54:43.680 --> 00:54:47.817
YOU KNOW ROGUE POLICE OFFICERS-

00:54:47.884 --> 00:54:50.053
THIS IS A QUESTION MY

00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:51.855
UNDERSTANDING AND PLEASE

00:54:51.921 --> 00:54:53.390
CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG IS

00:54:53.456 --> 00:54:56.359
THAT- THERE ARE A NUMBER OF

00:54:56.426 --> 00:54:58.361
VERY GOOD POLICE OFFICERS THAT

00:54:58.428 --> 00:55:00.397
ARE WORKING. FROM IN THE FIELD

00:55:00.463 --> 00:55:04.067
BUT THE ONES WHO ARE. ROGAN

00:55:04.134 --> 00:55:06.736
COMMITTING THESE- WHERE THEY'RE

00:55:06.803 --> 00:55:08.104
INVOLVED IN THESE INCIDENTS OF

00:55:08.171 --> 00:55:11.341
GROSS MISCONDUCT. THEY'RE ABLE

00:55:11.408 --> 00:55:13.810
TO ONCE THEY'RE TERMINATED OR

00:55:13.877 --> 00:55:15.578
DISCIPLINED THEY ARE STILL ABLE

00:55:15.645 --> 00:55:16.479
TO WEASEL INTO ANOTHER

00:55:16.546 --> 00:55:20.150
DEPARTMENT- AND SO WHICH IS IN

00:55:20.216 --> 00:55:22.252
ITS INFANT COMBIN UPON US TO

00:55:22.318 --> 00:55:24.954
FIGURE OUT WAYS TO FERRET THOSE

00:55:25.021 --> 00:55:28.191
BAD ACTORS OUT- BECAUSE THOSE

00:55:28.258 --> 00:55:30.593
BAD ACTORS ARE NOT ONLY HARMING

00:55:30.660 --> 00:55:32.462
THE PUBLIC BUT THEY'RE ALSO

00:55:32.529 --> 00:55:34.264
DOING HARM TO THEIR PARTICULAR

00:55:34.330 --> 00:55:36.766
DEPARTMENT- TO MAYBE TO THEIR

00:55:36.833 --> 00:55:38.435
COLLEAGUES AND THEIR PARTNERS

00:55:38.501 --> 00:55:41.137

IN AGREEMENT ON THAT AND THAT'S

00:55:46.342 --> 00:55:47.477
YOU KNOW IN MY IN MY OPENING

00:55:47.544 --> 00:55:48.678
STATEMENT I MENTIONED THAT YOU

00:55:48.745 --> 00:55:50.480
KNOW. WE FULLY SUPPORT POLICY

00:55:50.547 --> 00:55:52.015
THAT REQUIRES AGENCIES TO

00:55:52.082 --> 00:55:53.216
COMPLETE THESE INVESTIGATIONS

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:54.584
REGARDLESS OF THE OFFICER

00:55:54.651 --> 00:55:56.619
RESIGNS OR IS FIRED PART OF

00:55:56.686 --> 00:55:59.322
THE- THE- FINAL OUTCOME. SO

00:55:59.389 --> 00:56:00.890
THAT WE'RE NOT LETTING

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:03.059
INDIVIDUALS FALL TO THE CRACKS

00:56:03.126 --> 00:56:05.895

ABOUT ABOUT HOW LATERAL

00:56:13.069 --> 00:56:15.538
TRANSFERS- OFFICERS BEING HIRED

00:56:15.605 --> 00:56:17.841
ELSEWHERE- I THINK TO ALSO HELP

00:56:17.907 --> 00:56:20.643
PREVENT THAT WE NEED TO LOOK

00:56:20.710 --> 00:56:23.446
AT- INCLUDING OUR OUTREACH AND

00:56:23.513 --> 00:56:24.814

00:56:55.145 --> 00:56:56.346
KIND OF WHERE WE WOULD SEE MORE

00:57:27.410 --> 00:57:29.345
WITH THE GENERAL PUBLIC. BUT I

00:57:29.412 --> 00:57:30.079
TELL YOU THAT GREAT HARM CAN

00:57:30.146 --> 00:57:32.248
STILL BE DONE. BECAUSE THERE

00:57:32.315 --> 00:57:33.483
ARE STILL OPPORTUNITIES TO

00:57:33.550 --> 00:57:36.119
INTIMIDATE TO HARASS- TO IMPACT

00:57:36.186 --> 00:57:37.887
THE CULTURE IN THAT DEPARTMENT.

00:57:37.954 --> 00:57:39.289
TO FALSIFY RECORDS TO

00:57:39.355 --> 00:57:41.391
INTIMIDATE WITNESSES AND SO IT

00:57:41.457 --> 00:57:42.792
IS REALLY IMPORTANT THAT WE

00:57:42.859 --> 00:57:44.794
BEGIN TO LOOK AT ALL OF THESE

00:57:44.861 --> 00:57:46.462
ISSUES WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT.

00:57:46.529 --> 00:57:48.698
FROM THE STEM TO THE STERN SO

00:57:48.765 --> 00:57:50.400
THAT WE CAN CREATE DEPARTMENTS

00:57:50.466 --> 00:57:52.735
THAT. REPRESENT THE COMMUNITIES

00:57:52.802 --> 00:57:54.170

00:57:55.638 --> 00:57:56.539
THE TRUST WITH THOSE

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:58.007

00:58:00.476 --> 00:58:01.878

00:58:01.945 --> 00:58:03.513
IS STRIVING TO FIGURE OUT HOW

00:58:03.580 --> 00:58:05.281

00:58:05.348 --> 00:58:08.518
ACCOUNTABILITY- ON THE ONE END

00:58:08.585 --> 00:58:09.652

I'VE SEEN THAT THERE IS A

01:01:59.916 --> 01:02:01.384
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WE

01:02:01.451 --> 01:02:03.519

A MORE NUANCED APPROACH TO-

01:02:24.407 --> 01:02:25.942
HERE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE

01:02:26.008 --> 01:02:27.210
COMMISSION TO CONSIDER THESE

01:02:27.276 --> 01:02:29.378
PUNISHMENTS WITH REGARDS TO THE

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:32.248
SPECIFIC FACTS OF EACH CASE.

01:02:32.315 --> 01:02:33.316
THAT'S WHAT THE BACKGROUND

01:02:33.382 --> 01:02:34.717
INVESTIGATED THE INVESTIGATION

01:02:34.784 --> 01:02:36.586
IT'S ALL ABOUT I MEAN THERE'S

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.488
SIX LAYERS TO THE INVESTIGATION

01:02:38.554 --> 01:02:39.589
SO TO SAY THAT THERE'S A

01:02:39.655 --> 01:02:42.525
BLANKET. DISMISSAL ONCE YOU'RE

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.094
DETERMINED TO BE CERTIFIED AS A

ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE EVEN

01:02:53.469 --> 01:02:54.570
IF IT WAS DETERMINED THAT THEY

01:02:54.637 --> 01:02:56.606
SHOULD BE TO CERTIFY THEY CAN

01:02:56.672 --> 01:02:57.807
STILL TAKE THAT DECISION TO

01:02:57.874 --> 01:02:59.142
ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGES OF

01:02:59.208 --> 01:03:00.843
THEIR WRISTS SIX STEPS. THAT

01:03:00.910 --> 01:03:03.613
HAVE TO HAPPEN BEFORE AN

01:03:05.515 --> 01:03:06.549
AS A LAW ENFORCEMENT THERE ARE

01:03:06.616 --> 01:03:08.718
PLENTY CHECKS AND BALANCES HERE

01:03:08.784 --> 01:03:10.553
AND YES THERE ARE SOME NUANCES.

01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.488
CASE IN POINT I INDIVIDUAL WHO

01:03:12.555 --> 01:03:16.225
THE USERS OF THIS DESCRIPTION-

01:03:16.292 --> 01:03:19.996
A YEAR AGO OR SO. THERE WAS A-

01:03:20.062 --> 01:03:22.565
CRIMINAL WHO HELD A KNIFE TO A

01:03:22.632 --> 01:03:24.567
WOMAN'S THROAT ANY WAS THE

01:03:24.634 --> 01:03:26.202
BURDEN THAT SLIT HER THROAT AND

01:03:26.269 --> 01:03:27.503
IN THE PROCESS OF SELLING IT TO

01:03:27.570 --> 01:03:28.804
THIRD BAY TRIED TO SHOOT TO.

01:03:28.871 --> 01:03:30.072
THAT THE SUSPECT AND THEY

KILLED THE WOMAN THAT OFF YOU

01:03:31.908 --> 01:03:33.676
SHOULDN'T LOSE HIS JOB FOR A

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:35.411
SITUATION LIKE THAT SO THERE

01:03:35.478 --> 01:03:37.947
WILL BE CLEAR. DELINEATIONS

01:03:38.014 --> 01:03:40.049
ASKED WHAT IS DEAN ON LAWFUL

01:03:40.116 --> 01:03:41.717

01:03:41.784 --> 01:03:44.620
LINE OF DOING THEIR JOB SO. I

01:03:44.687 --> 01:03:45.821
THINK TO CHECKS AND BALANCES

01:03:45.888 --> 01:03:47.056

01:04:29.398 --> 01:04:30.566
COUNTRY WHICH COINCIDENCE

01:04:30.633 --> 01:04:32.501
COINCIDENTALLY IS WHY SUPPORT

01:04:32.568 --> 01:04:34.570
DESERTIFICATION PROCESS-

01:04:34.637 --> 01:04:35.871
HOWEVER DO HAVE A CONCERN ABOUT

01:04:35.938 --> 01:04:38.140
THE MAKEUP OF THE BOARD. I

01:04:38.207 --> 01:04:39.342
THINK THAT ONLY HAVING TWO OF

01:04:39.408 --> 01:04:41.344
THE NINE MEMBERS WHO UNDERSTAND

01:04:41.410 --> 01:04:42.511
THE PERSPECTIVE OF LAW

01:04:42.578 --> 01:04:44.146
ENFORCEMENT. AND CAN PROVIDE

01:04:44.213 --> 01:04:45.881
THE VALUABLE INSIGHT CREATES A

01:04:45.948 --> 01:04:47.917
SYSTEM THAT MIGHT BE PERCEIVED

01:04:47.984 --> 01:04:51.587
AS UNFAIR- I WOULD ALSO NOTE

01:04:51.654 --> 01:04:53.856
THAT AT NOT PROMOTE OUT MAKE UP

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:56.392
OF THE OPPOSITE. A BOARD WITH

01:04:56.459 --> 01:04:57.627
SEVEN LAW ENFORCEMENT RELATED

01:04:57.693 --> 01:04:58.694
SEATS AND TO OUTSIDE

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:00.596
ORGANIZATIONS AS THAT WOULD NOT

01:05:00.663 --> 01:05:01.731
BE A FAIR PROCESS FOR THE

01:05:01.797 --> 01:05:03.733
PUBLIC. HAVE YOU CONSIDERED ANY

01:05:03.799 --> 01:05:05.401
WAYS TO MAKE THIS BOARD A

01:05:05.468 --> 01:05:07.103
LITTLE MORE BALANCED AND FAIR

01:05:07.169 --> 01:05:08.604
TO ENSURE THAT YES BUT OFFICERS

01:05:08.671 --> 01:05:10.139
ARE TO CERTIFIED IN THE PUBLIC

01:05:10.206 --> 01:05:11.807
INTEREST IS ALSO PROTECTED BUT

01:05:11.874 --> 01:05:13.042
ALSO THEY BRING THE OFFICERS

01:05:13.109 --> 01:05:14.944
GET A FAIR HEARING. I THINK

01:05:15.011 --> 01:05:16.879
THIS IS FAIR WE TRUST TWELVE

01:05:16.946 --> 01:05:18.748
LEHMAN FROM THE COMMUNITY SAID

01:05:18.814 --> 01:05:20.082
IN A JURY BOX AND DETERMINE

01:05:20.149 --> 01:05:22.184
ONCE A LIFE OR DEATH. EVERY DAY

01:05:22.251 --> 01:05:24.720
AND TRIALS BUT WE DON'T TRUST

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:27.089
SEVEN CITIZENS TO REVIEW LAW

01:05:27.156 --> 01:05:29.158
ENFORCEMENT ALONG WITH. TWO

01:05:29.225 --> 01:05:30.660
POLICE OFFICERS TO PEOPLE WOULD

01:05:30.726 --> 01:05:31.827
LAW ENFORCEMENT BACKGROUNDS WE

01:05:31.894 --> 01:05:34.397
HAVE NEGOTIATED- THAT

01:05:34.463 --> 01:05:36.265
COMBINATION OF WE'VE LAST YEAR

01:05:36.332 --> 01:05:38.934
WE HAD OFFERED FIVE AND FOUR.

01:05:39.001 --> 01:05:40.436
WE HAD SIX AND THREE NOTHING

01:05:40.503 --> 01:05:42.171
THE AGREED UPON SO WE'RE

01:05:42.238 --> 01:05:44.140
STARTING BACK WITH WHAT. OUR

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:46.042
SUPPORTERS AND I WANT AND NOT

01:05:46.108 --> 01:05:47.276
SEVEN INTO WE THINK IT'S GOING

01:05:47.343 --> 01:05:48.978
TO BE FAIR THESE THE SEVEN

01:05:49.045 --> 01:05:51.080
CITIZENS ARE NOT. HELLO ARE YOU

01:05:51.147 --> 01:05:52.581

HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE AT THIS

01:05:56.319 --> 01:05:57.720
SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY'RE NOT A

01:05:57.787 --> 01:05:58.654
POLICE OFFICER DOESN'T MEAN

01:05:58.721 --> 01:06:00.389
THEY CANNOT. RENDER A FAIR

01:06:00.456 --> 01:06:02.491
DECISION THAT IS. COULD BE VERY

01:06:02.558 --> 01:06:04.794
WELL FAVORABLE PORT OFFICER SO

01:06:04.860 --> 01:06:07.096
I DON'T THINK BIASES IS THERE

01:06:07.163 --> 01:06:08.664
SIMPLY BECAUSE THE MAJORITY OF

01:06:08.731 --> 01:06:14.503
THE MAKE UP OF THIS COMMITTEES.

01:06:14.570 --> 01:06:15.104
NON SWORN POLICE OFFICERS. I

01:06:15.171 --> 01:06:16.172
THINK THE WAS MORE WE REGARD TO

01:06:16.238 --> 01:06:18.040
THE BACKGROUND THE

OUT POSTED ON THERE- INDIA IS A

01:06:34.724 --> 01:06:36.125

CONCERN. I MEAN. WE'RE JUST NOT

01:06:47.169 --> 01:06:48.437

LET'S SEE HERE. SOME MAY

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.227
CONSTRUE THIS THAT THE PROCESS

PROCESS. I THINK IT'S MORE

01:09:06.842 --> 01:09:08.911
SAFEGUARDS FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:09:08.978 --> 01:09:11.046
THAT IT IS FOR BARBER OR BARBER

01:09:11.113 --> 01:09:14.884
CAN SHOW UP DRUNK. AND LOSE

01:09:14.950 --> 01:09:17.086
THEIR LICENSE. THAT DOESN'T

01:09:17.152 --> 01:09:18.754
APPLY TO A POLICE OFFICER RIGHT

01:09:18.821 --> 01:09:19.889

MIGHT BE YOU KNOW DISCIPLINE

01:09:22.157 --> 01:09:23.526
BUT A BARBER CAN LOSE THEIR

01:09:23.592 --> 01:09:24.627
LICENSE SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY

01:09:24.693 --> 01:09:26.529
SHOWEDUP AND DROP A BARBICAN

01:09:26.595 --> 01:09:27.963
LOSE THEIR LICENSE FOR FALSE

01:09:28.030 --> 01:09:31.233

BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE THAT SO I

01:09:44.613 --> 01:09:47.116

01:09:47.182 --> 01:09:49.285
ENFORCEMENT AS FAR AS- BEING

01:09:49.351 --> 01:09:51.053

DOCTOR A LAWYER TO BE DISBARRED.

01:09:57.459 --> 01:09:58.994
IT SHOULD BE EASIER TO SAVE FOR

01:09:59.061 --> 01:10:00.129
THOSE FOLKS TO LEGALIZE AND

01:10:00.195 --> 01:10:00.996

01:12:38.087 --> 01:12:38.921
RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE

01:12:38.987 --> 01:12:40.422
QUESTIONS THAT YOU ASKED WHICH

01:12:40.489 --> 01:12:42.424
I THINK ARE REALLY GOOD

01:12:42.491 --> 01:12:43.092
QUESTIONS. YOU KNOW AS YOU

01:12:43.158 --> 01:12:45.094
WERE- ASKING ABOUT THE

01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:47.796
BACKGROUND OF- THE MEMBERSHIP

01:12:47.863 --> 01:12:49.965
OF THE COMMISSION IT STRUCK ME

01:12:50.032 --> 01:12:51.867
THAT THERE'S A HUNDRED AND

01:12:51.934 --> 01:12:52.801
TWENTY OF US THAT SERVE IN THE

01:12:52.868 --> 01:12:55.504
LEGISLATURE. AND VERY FEW OF US

01:12:55.571 --> 01:12:57.740
COME FROM A BACKGROUND OF

01:12:57.806 --> 01:13:00.676
LEGISLATIVE WORK. WHAT WE DO IS

01:13:00.743 --> 01:13:02.778
WE ARE A DIVERSE GROUP OF

01:13:02.845 --> 01:13:05.647
INDIVIDUALS. THAT REPRESENT ALL

01:13:05.714 --> 01:13:07.850
OF THE DIVERSITY OF THIS STATE

01:13:07.916 --> 01:13:09.418
AND WE BRING OUR UNIQUE

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:11.820
PERSPECTIVES. AND ARE DIFFERENT

01:13:11.887 --> 01:13:14.022
WORK HISTORIES AND EXPERIENCES

01:13:14.089 --> 01:13:16.291
TO THE TABLE AND I BELIEVE THAT

01:13:16.358 --> 01:13:18.894
WE USE. THOSE EXPERIENCES ON

01:13:18.961 --> 01:13:19.561
THOSE VERY DIFFERENT

01:13:19.628 --> 01:13:21.830
BACKGROUNDS. TO REALLY COLOR IN

01:13:21.897 --> 01:13:23.398
THE DISCUSSIONS WE HAVE AROUND

01:13:23.465 --> 01:13:27.136
POLICY. AND I THINK THAT IS. A

01:13:27.202 --> 01:13:28.437
SIMILAR INTENT FOR THIS

01:13:28.504 --> 01:13:30.939
COMMISSION. I THINK IT ALLOWS

01:13:31.006 --> 01:13:32.441
FOR THERE TO BE MORE OPEN

01:13:32.508 --> 01:13:34.376
MINDED DISCUSSIONS AND FOR

01:13:34.443 --> 01:13:36.845
THEIR TO BE FRESH APPROACHES TO

01:13:36.912 --> 01:13:38.580
HOW DIFFERENT INVESTIGATIONS

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:42.785
ARE REVIEWED- AND EVEN

01:13:42.851 --> 01:13:43.952
INVESTIGATED AND DISCUSSED.

01:13:44.019 --> 01:13:45.988
OFTEN TIMES WHEN YOU HAVE

01:13:46.054 --> 01:13:48.090
EVERYONE YOU KNOW FROM THE

01:13:48.157 --> 01:13:52.027
SAME- SPACE TALKING WE END UP

01:13:52.094 --> 01:13:53.629
HAVING GROUP THINK WE END UP

01:13:53.695 --> 01:13:56.498
USING ACRONYMS AND WE FALL INTO

01:13:56.565 --> 01:13:58.500
A COMFORT ZONE THAT DOESN'T

01:13:58.567 --> 01:14:00.169
ALLOW FOR DIFFERENT

01:14:00.235 --> 01:14:02.204
PERSPECTIVES TO BE SHARED. I

01:14:02.271 --> 01:14:03.939
THINK YOU KNOW HAVING SOMEONE

01:14:04.006 --> 01:14:05.741
WITH A SOCIAL WORKER EXPERIENCE

01:14:05.808 --> 01:14:07.442
OR SOMEONE WHO IS A NURSE OR

01:14:07.509 --> 01:14:09.478
SOMEONE WHO IS A CAREGIVER FOR

01:14:09.545 --> 01:14:12.314
SOMEONE WHO IS A PASTOR- COULD

01:14:12.381 --> 01:14:14.516
PROBABLY BRING A DIFFERENT AND

01:14:14.583 --> 01:14:16.985
FRESH PERSPECTIVE. TO THE

01:14:17.052 --> 01:14:18.587
DISCUSSIONS WERE HAVING AROUND

01:14:18.654 --> 01:14:20.756
WHAT PUBLIC SAFETY MEANS WHAT

01:14:20.823 --> 01:14:22.858
EXCESSIVE FORCE LOOKS LIKE HOW

01:14:22.925 --> 01:14:25.594
IT IS PERCEIVED SO I THINK WE

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:27.596
SHOULD AND I'M ALSO SAYING THIS

01:14:27.663 --> 01:14:29.298
TO THE OPPOSITION PUT A LITTLE

01:14:29.364 --> 01:14:32.501
FAITH. IN THE PUBLIC THAT WE

01:14:32.568 --> 01:14:37.840
ALL WANT YOU KNOW THE SAME.

01:14:37.906 --> 01:14:39.842
GOOD TO FEEL SAFE AND THAT

01:14:39.908 --> 01:14:40.976
HOPEFULLY WHEN YOU HAVE A

01:14:41.043 --> 01:14:41.977
CONSTELLATION OF DIFFERENT

01:14:42.044 --> 01:14:45.280
IDEAS AND PERSPECTIVES- LENDING

01:14:45.347 --> 01:14:46.815
THEMSELVES TO THE DECISION

01:14:46.882 --> 01:14:48.584
MAKING PROCESS- FOR THIS

01:14:48.650 --> 01:14:51.186
COMMISSION THAT SOMETHING WILL

01:14:51.253 --> 01:14:53.755
HAPPEN THAT IS FAIR- I ALSO

01:14:53.822 --> 01:14:55.624
THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR. THE

01:14:55.691 --> 01:14:58.026
OPPOSITION TO REMEMBER THAT LAW

01:14:58.093 --> 01:15:00.128
ENFORCEMENT. IT COMES FULLY

01:15:00.195 --> 01:15:01.630
CLOAKED WITH FULL

01:15:01.697 --> 01:15:04.633
REPRESENTATION THEY ARE UNION

01:15:04.700 --> 01:15:07.502
MEMBERS THEY HAVE THE SUPPORT

01:15:07.569 --> 01:15:09.738
OF THEIR UNION THEY OFTEN ARE

01:15:09.805 --> 01:15:11.406
GIVEN ACCESS TO COUNCIL

01:15:11.473 --> 01:15:13.242
IMMEDIATELY- WHEN AN

01:15:13.308 --> 01:15:16.245
INVESTIGATION IS STARTED- POPE

01:15:16.311 --> 01:15:18.113
ARE IS STILL VERY MUCH IN

01:15:18.180 --> 01:15:21.717
AFFECT. AND SO THE SYSTEM AS IT

01:15:21.783 --> 01:15:24.419
CURRENTLY STANDS REALLY STILL

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:26.555
DOES AIR ON THE SIDE OF LAW

01:15:26.622 --> 01:15:28.223
ENFORCEMENT TO GIVE THEM AMPLE

01:15:28.290 --> 01:15:30.726
PROTECTION BECAUSE I THINK IN

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:31.560
THE GRAND DESIGN IN THE

01:15:31.627 --> 01:15:34.162
BEGINNING PEOPLE UNDERSTOOD

01:15:34.229 --> 01:15:38.834
THAT THESE ARE- DANGEROUS JOBS-

01:15:38.901 --> 01:15:41.003
AND THAT FOLKS WHO ARE

01:15:41.069 --> 01:15:43.071
COURAGEOUS ENOUGH TO DO THEM.

01:15:43.138 --> 01:15:45.307
ACTUALLY DO DESERVE SUPPORT AND

01:15:45.374 --> 01:15:48.243
SO I ALSO WANT US TO BE REALLY

01:15:48.310 --> 01:15:50.712
MINDFUL OF THAT AND THE GOAL IS

01:15:50.779 --> 01:15:53.949
NOT TO. RELIEVE FOLKS OF ANY

01:15:54.016 --> 01:15:55.550
PROTECTIONS BUT IT IS TO ADD

01:15:55.617 --> 01:15:57.653
ADDITIONAL LAYERS OF

01:15:57.719 --> 01:16:00.622
TRANSPARENCY AND- UNBIASED

01:16:00.689 --> 01:16:03.191
OBJECTIVE INVESTIGATION INTO

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:05.827
OFTENTIMES IT'S THE SAME SMALL

01:16:05.894 --> 01:16:07.663
GROUP OF LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:16:07.729 --> 01:16:10.499
OFFICERS VETERAN TO ENGAGE. IN

01:16:10.565 --> 01:16:13.035
THIS KIND OF ACTIVITY THAT

01:16:13.101 --> 01:16:16.104
ULTIMATELY- SPREAD I THINK FEAR

01:16:16.171 --> 01:16:18.240
AND DISCONTENT AND LOW MORALE

01:16:18.307 --> 01:16:19.975
BOTH IN THE COMMUNITY BUT ALSO

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.644
WITHIN THE RANKS AND SO HOW DO

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:24.413
WE FIND A WAY TO INCISIVE LEO

01:16:24.479 --> 01:16:26.415
ATTACK. ON THOSE KINDS OF

01:16:26.481 --> 01:16:28.150
CHALLENGES THAT LAW ENFORCEMENT

01:16:28.216 --> 01:16:30.252
IS DEALING WITH IN A WAY THAT

01:16:30.319 --> 01:16:31.586
KEEPS DEPARTMENTS HOLD BUT ALSO

01:16:31.653 --> 01:16:34.222
GIVES PROTECTION OFTENTIMES TO

01:16:34.289 --> 01:16:36.625
LAW ENFORCEMENT WHO DON'T HAVE

01:16:36.692 --> 01:16:38.694
THE COURAGE OFTEN TO HANDLE THE

01:16:38.760 --> 01:16:39.962
BAD ACTORS THAT ARE IN THEIR

01:16:40.028 --> 01:16:41.797
OWN DEPARTMENTS BECAUSE OF THE

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.665
CULTURE. THAT IS REALLY SO

01:16:43.732 --> 01:16:45.200
PERVASIVE AND SOMETIMES

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:47.703
OPPRESSIVE SO I JUST WANTED TO

01:16:47.769 --> 01:16:49.237

TIME I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT.

01:36:41.595 --> 01:36:43.831
HAVING A OPPORTUNITY. WHICH IS

01:36:43.898 --> 01:36:46.734
SOMETHING TO CONSIDER- I

01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.368
TOTALLY SUPPORT WHAT THIS BILL

01:36:47.434 --> 01:36:51.172
IS TRYING TO DO. WITH THE TWO

01:36:51.238 --> 01:36:52.907
HUNDRED FIFTY. WE HAVE- A

01:36:52.973 --> 01:36:55.142
SOMEONE WHO REPRESENTS A VERY.

01:36:55.209 --> 01:36:59.146
ODD TIMES PART OF CALIFORNIA-

01:36:59.213 --> 01:37:00.848
FREQUENTLY THE LEGISLATURE

01:37:00.915 --> 01:37:04.218
SETS. DISTANCES THAT ARE.

01:37:04.285 --> 01:37:06.287
IRRESPECTIVE OF DENSITY AND

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:08.622
THAT FRANKLY ARE. MORE FLEXIBLE

01:37:08.689 --> 01:37:11.959
AND MORE SUBURBAN. SETTINGS AND

01:37:12.026 --> 01:37:13.460
THAT MAY HAVE UNINTENDED

01:37:13.527 --> 01:37:15.829
CONSEQUENCES IN VERY DENSELY

01:37:15.896 --> 01:37:19.567
POPULATED. URBAN AREAS AND SO

01:37:19.633 --> 01:37:20.134
WE SEE THIS IN A NUMBER OF

01:37:20.201 --> 01:37:22.469
DIFFERENT CONTEXTS. TWO HUNDRED

01:37:22.536 --> 01:37:25.706
FEET AND- DENSE URBAN SETTING.

01:37:25.773 --> 01:37:27.374
CAN ACTUALLY BE QUITE.

01:37:27.441 --> 01:37:29.076
SIGNIFICANT IT'S DIFFERENT THAN

01:37:29.143 --> 01:37:30.344
SAY A SUBURBAN SETTING WHERE

01:37:30.411 --> 01:37:32.246
YOU'RE VOTING AT A SCHOOL OR A

01:37:32.313 --> 01:37:34.014
CHURCH OR OR WHATEVER WERE IT

01:37:34.081 --> 01:37:35.282
DOESN'T IF YOU'RE STILL IN THE

01:37:35.349 --> 01:37:37.017
PARKING LOT BY THE TIME YOU GET

01:37:37.084 --> 01:37:39.053
TO TWO HUNDRED FEET. AND IN A

01:37:39.119 --> 01:37:39.987
DENSE URBAN SETTING IF YOU HAVE

01:37:40.054 --> 01:37:43.557
A- A DROP BOX OR A BOAT OR A

01:37:43.624 --> 01:37:46.961
VOTING- STATION. THAT IS NEAR

01:37:47.027 --> 01:37:48.095
LIKE A COMMERCIAL CORPORATE OR

01:37:48.162 --> 01:37:49.830
IT COULD MEAN PATERNITY COULD

01:37:49.897 --> 01:37:52.433
EVEN INTENDS INTO AN AREA WHERE

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:54.001
EVERYONE WOULD WOULD SAY THAT

01:37:54.068 --> 01:37:55.603
THAT'S AN APPROPRIATE PLACE TO

01:37:55.669 --> 01:37:57.571
CAMPAIGN OR EVEN TO REALLY

01:37:57.638 --> 01:37:58.939
CENTRAL AREA WHERE WE WOULD

01:37:59.006 --> 01:38:00.874
FRANK YOU WANT PEOPLE. TO BE

01:38:00.941 --> 01:38:04.979
CAMPAIGNING SO I JUST WANT TO

01:38:05.045 --> 01:38:05.646
PUT THAT OUT THERE IF YOU COULD.

01:38:05.713 --> 01:38:06.480
TO CONSIDER I MAYBE YOU AND I

01:38:06.547 --> 01:38:08.015
COULD. TRY ABOUT AT SOME POINT

01:38:08.082 --> 01:38:09.750
I DON'T KNOW IF IT'S SOLVABLE.

01:38:09.817 --> 01:38:11.652
IN THIS BILL BUT- THAT'S AN

01:38:11.719 --> 01:38:13.254
ONGOING ISSUE. IN A NUMBER OF

01:38:13.320 --> 01:38:15.522
DIFFERENT AREAS AND I SEE IT

01:38:15.589 --> 01:38:16.090
POTENTIALLY BEING A PROBLEM

01:38:16.156 --> 01:38:20.261

OF THE BILL IS TO MAKE SURE

01:38:49.990 --> 01:38:51.191

01:39:47.848 --> 01:39:48.982
HUNDRED FEET FROM THE LAST

01:39:49.049 --> 01:39:50.751

THE CHALLENGES THAT. IT DOESN'T

01:40:03.764 --> 01:40:04.998

BUILDING IN WHICH THE VOTE IS

01:40:15.242 --> 01:40:16.310
HAPPENING WHERE YOU'RE CASTING

01:40:16.377 --> 01:40:18.679
YOUR BALLOT. AREAS LATER ON IN

DIFFERENT AS PEOPLE LINE UP

01:40:21.849 --> 01:40:23.717
OUTSIDE SO IF YOU ADJUSTED BY

01:40:23.784 --> 01:40:26.186
THE LENGTH OF THE LINE- WEEK WE

01:40:26.253 --> 01:40:27.888
COULD CERTAINLY CONSIDER WE

01:40:27.955 --> 01:40:29.189
THOUGHT ABOUT IT BUT- THE

01:40:29.256 --> 01:40:30.657
REGISTRARS NEED CLEAR

01:40:30.724 --> 01:40:33.093
DEFINITION. IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

LAW. SO IF THERE'S SOME OF THAT

01:40:37.998 --> 01:40:40.033
THERE'S SOME OTHER PERMUTATION

01:40:40.100 --> 01:40:40.634
THAT WE HAVEN'T CONSIDERED I'M

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:43.103
OPEN TO IT. SOME MAY BE WITHIN

01:40:43.170 --> 01:40:45.005
A HUNDRED FEET UNLESS YOU KNOW

01:40:45.072 --> 01:40:46.306
THE LINE EXTENDS FURTHER THAN

01:40:46.373 --> 01:40:47.975
THAT THEN IT'S TWO HUNDRED FEET

01:40:48.041 --> 01:40:50.344
OR A HUNDRED FEET FROM THAT-

01:40:50.411 --> 01:40:51.578
JUST TAKE JUST A CONSIDERATION

01:40:51.645 --> 01:40:54.014
AT GOOD POINT THOUGH I AND- I

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:54.882
DIDN'T HAVE CONSIDER THAT BUT I

01:40:54.948 --> 01:40:58.352
DO CONSIDER- LOCATIONS SUCH AS-

01:40:58.419 --> 01:40:59.820

AND THE COMMUNITIES WHICH

01:41:26.146 --> 01:41:30.517
WHICH- OBVIOUSLY- DUE TO THE

01:41:30.584 --> 01:41:32.119
TIMING AND- TYPE OF INFORMATION

01:41:32.186 --> 01:41:33.554

KNOW SOON BECAUSE OTHERWISE IT

01:41:36.990 --> 01:41:38.759
JUST BECOMES VERY DISTANT AND-

01:41:38.826 --> 01:41:41.562
AND- YOU KNOW THEY FOR THE

01:41:41.628 --> 01:41:44.364
FORGET- IS THERE A WAY THAT YOU

01:41:44.431 --> 01:41:45.032
COULD TAKE THAT INTO

01:41:45.098 --> 01:41:46.467
CONSIDERATION AS TO THE

01:41:46.533 --> 01:41:48.435
FACILITIES. SUCH AS SENIOR FOR

01:42:07.087 --> 01:42:08.388
YOU'RE DROPPING OFF THIRTY DAYS

01:42:08.455 --> 01:42:09.656
AHEAD OF TIME IT'S NOT FOR A

01:42:09.723 --> 01:42:10.891
VOTE CENTER WHICH MAY ONLY BE

01:42:10.958 --> 01:42:12.259
OPEN FOR DAYS AT A TIME BUT

01:42:12.326 --> 01:42:13.527
WE'LL LOOK AT IT TO MAKE SURE.

01:42:13.594 --> 01:42:15.095
BUT WE DON'T WANT IT IS WE

01:42:15.162 --> 01:42:17.097
DON'T WANT PEOPLE STANDING

01:42:17.164 --> 01:42:20.667

01:42:20.734 --> 01:42:21.235
TWENTY NINE DAYS BEFORE THE

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:22.069
ELECTION WHEN PEOPLE ACTUALLY

01:42:22.135 --> 01:42:23.370
ARE TRYING TO CAST THEIR BALLOT

01:42:23.437 --> 01:42:25.639
THAT SO WE DON'T WANT. AND AS

01:42:25.706 --> 01:42:27.441
AS WAS ILLUSTRATED BY THE-

01:42:27.508 --> 01:42:31.812
WITNESS FROM A NEVADA COUNTY

01:42:31.879 --> 01:42:32.312

SEE. AND AS FAR AS MAKING- SO

01:42:51.031 --> 01:42:52.099
THE OTHER CONCERN THAT I HAVE

01:42:52.165 --> 01:42:55.769
HERE IS THAT IT CRIMINALIZES-

01:42:55.836 --> 01:42:58.071
ELECTIONEERING BEAT WITHIN TWO

CONSISTENT MORE- TO THE POINT

01:43:03.277 --> 01:43:05.979
IS THAT. THEY'RE CERTAINLY

01:43:06.046 --> 01:43:07.047
GOING TO BE A LOT OF PEOPLE

01:43:07.114 --> 01:43:09.049
THAT ARE NOT AWARE OF THE

01:43:09.116 --> 01:43:11.218
ABERRATIONS WHO FINDS US WEEKS

01:43:11.285 --> 01:43:11.985
LATER BEFORE AN ELECTION

01:43:12.052 --> 01:43:14.454
WEARING. OTHERWISE JUST PLAYING

YOU KNOW- CANDID OR CAMPAIGN IT

01:43:16.957 --> 01:43:21.562
PARAPHERNALIA ADAM. BUT THERE

01:43:21.628 --> 01:43:23.931
THE FINES AND THE IS THERE LIKE

01:43:23.997 --> 01:43:26.099
A WARNING THAT YOU MAY BE ABLE

01:43:26.166 --> 01:43:28.335
TO GIVE SOMEONE BEFORE MOVING

01:43:28.402 --> 01:43:30.370
FORWARD WITH PENALTIES. WELL

01:43:30.437 --> 01:43:31.905
THIS DOESN'T CREATE NEW

01:43:31.972 --> 01:43:33.140
PENALTIES WHAT THIS DOES IS IT

01:43:33.206 --> 01:43:35.175
FURTHER DEFINES SO FOR EXAMPLE

THING WITH THE ZONE IT EXPANDS

01:43:39.112 --> 01:43:40.847
UP FROM ONE HUNDRED FEET TO TWO

01:43:40.914 --> 01:43:42.115
HUNDRED FEET IT DOESN'T CREATE

01:43:42.182 --> 01:43:44.451
A NEW STATUTES WITH NEW

01:43:44.518 --> 01:43:46.820
PENALTIES. BOB CAN'T CAN FOLKS

DISCRETION TO THOSE WHO WOULD

01:43:53.560 --> 01:43:55.862

NATURE A COMMERCIAL I'M EVEN IF

02:37:19.563 --> 02:37:21.799
IS PUT ON A PERSON. ONCE THEY

02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:23.901
HAVE A RECORD. NOW CLEARLY. IF

02:37:23.967 --> 02:37:26.537
A PERSON HAS COMMITTED A CRIME.

AND YOU KNOW WE'VE CONVICTED

02:37:29.339 --> 02:37:31.108
AND- GIVEN WHATEVER

02:37:36.446 --> 02:37:38.982
THEY HAVE BEEN BEEN CRIME FREE.

02:37:39.049 --> 02:37:40.584
THERE SHOULD BE NO MORE STICKY.

02:37:40.651 --> 02:37:41.785
THEY'VE ALREADY KAY AND THEIR

02:37:41.852 --> 02:37:43.787
FAMILIES ALREADY HAVE HAD GREAT

02:37:43.854 --> 02:37:45.856

PROCESS OF. YOU KNOW HAVING TO

02:37:50.327 --> 02:37:52.462
DEAL WITH THE CONVICTION AND-

02:37:52.529 --> 02:37:53.897
IF THEY HAVE TO GO TO COURT AND

02:37:53.964 --> 02:37:55.632
THEN OF COURSE ANY TIME IN JAIL

02:37:55.699 --> 02:37:57.034

02:37:57.100 --> 02:37:58.802
GREAT GREAT ECONOMIC

02:37:58.869 --> 02:37:59.736
CONSEQUENCES TODAY AND THEIR

02:37:59.803 --> 02:38:02.105
FAMILIES. SO ONCE THEY ARE

02:38:02.172 --> 02:38:04.007
CRIME FREE WE HAVE TO REMOVE

02:38:04.074 --> 02:38:05.843
EVERY OBSTACLE FOR PEOPLE TO BE

02:38:05.909 --> 02:38:08.779
ABLE TO FUNCTION. AND THAT

02:38:08.846 --> 02:38:11.915
RECORD. IS A BARRIER JUSTICE

02:38:11.982 --> 02:38:14.151
THE AUTHOR SAID IN ALMOST EVERY

02:38:14.218 --> 02:38:16.220
ASPECT OF LIFE. IT IS LIKE YOU

NEVER REALLY ALLOWED TO FULLY

02:38:21.425 --> 02:38:24.094
FUNCTION. AND I JUST THINK THAT

02:38:24.161 --> 02:38:28.498
IT IS. NOT SOMETHING THAT WE- I

02:38:28.565 --> 02:38:29.833
WANT TO DO. AN WHEN WE ARE

02:38:29.900 --> 02:38:33.170
THINK ABOUT. THAT IT IS

02:38:33.237 --> 02:38:35.873
DISPROPORTIONATE WHO IS. STOP

02:38:35.939 --> 02:38:39.576
ARRESTED CHARGED AND CONVICTED

02:38:39.643 --> 02:38:41.912
FOR EXAMPLE I DON'T HAVE ANY

02:38:41.979 --> 02:38:43.280
MEMBER OF MY FAMILY WHO ARE

02:38:43.347 --> 02:38:45.148

02:38:45.215 --> 02:38:47.951
MANY MEMBERS OF MY FAMILY HAVE

COMMITTED CRIMES. AND THEY WERE

02:38:50.821 --> 02:38:51.555
LET OFF FOR ANY NUMBER OF

02:38:51.622 --> 02:38:53.857
THINGS. AND SO THEY DON'T HAVE

02:38:53.924 --> 02:38:57.060
THAT STIGMA. SO I JUST FEEL WE

02:38:57.127 --> 02:38:59.296
NEED TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO

02:38:59.363 --> 02:39:01.965
ONCE A PERSON HAS IS CRIME FREE

02:39:02.032 --> 02:39:03.767

EVEN MOVE IT BUT I THINK IT'S

02:39:11.742 --> 02:39:13.377
NOT APPROPRIATE TO DO THAT TO

AND WON'T BE ABLE TO LOOK PAST

03:15:59.047 --> 03:16:00.682
THAT BUT AS SOMEONE WHO.

03:16:00.748 --> 03:16:01.883
PERSONALLY HAD A FAMILY MEMBER

03:16:01.950 --> 03:16:03.952
WHO HAS EMPLOYED PEOPLE WHO

03:16:04.018 --> 03:16:05.987
HAVE SERVED TIME BECAUSE HE

03:16:06.054 --> 03:16:08.056
BELIEVES THAT EVERYONE DESERVES

03:16:08.123 --> 03:16:11.526
A SECOND CHANCE. I AM CONCERNED

03:16:11.593 --> 03:16:16.431
THOUGH THAT. PEOPLE WITH THE IN

03:16:16.498 --> 03:16:23.071
CERTAIN. CRIME CATEGORIES-

03:16:23.138 --> 03:16:25.473
APPLY TO CERTAIN JOBS THAT KIND

03:16:25.540 --> 03:16:29.144
OF REFLECTOR UNDER ARE ARE

03:16:29.210 --> 03:16:31.079
WHAT'S THE WORD I'M LOOKING FOR.

THAT COVER FOR- GIVE ME ONE

03:16:34.916 --> 03:16:37.352
SECOND LET ME SEE IF I CAN

03:16:37.418 --> 03:16:41.156
ARTICULATE THIS A LITTLE BETTER.

03:16:41.222 --> 03:16:46.427
WHOSE CRIME. HIS CRIME-

03:16:46.494 --> 03:16:49.230
AFFECTED OR REFLECTED EIGHT JOB

03:16:49.297 --> 03:16:53.034
THAT THEY'RE PURSUING- SO AND

03:16:53.101 --> 03:16:55.436
ACCOUNT FOR INSTANCE AND- IN

03:16:55.503 --> 03:16:56.971
THIS IS PROBABLY A TERRIBLE

03:16:57.038 --> 03:16:58.640
EXAMPLE BECAUSE YOU KNOW THAT

03:16:58.706 --> 03:16:59.874
IS THEIR LIVELIHOOD THAT IS OUR

03:16:59.941 --> 03:17:01.176
SKILL SET BUT IF THEY ACTED IN

03:17:01.242 --> 03:17:03.845
IT AND NOTHING UNETHICAL WAY

03:17:03.912 --> 03:17:05.079
WHERE THEY HAVE TO SERVE TIME

03:17:05.146 --> 03:17:06.014
AND THEY WERE TRYING TO RE

03:17:06.080 --> 03:17:08.016
APPLY I GUESS YOU COULD ALWAYS

03:17:08.082 --> 03:17:12.353
GO. INDEPENDENT ON THAT END BUT-

03:17:12.420 --> 03:17:13.555
IF I CAN MAKE THAT JUST AS AN

03:17:13.621 --> 03:17:16.925
EXAMPLE AS IS THAT BEING- KIND

03:17:16.991 --> 03:17:20.995
OF A- YOU KNOW AS AN EMPLOYER I

03:17:21.062 --> 03:17:22.463
WOULD HAVE YOU KNOW NOT FOR ME

03:17:22.530 --> 03:17:23.932
PERSONALLY BUT FOR SOME MIGHT

03:17:23.998 --> 03:17:26.100
HAVE HESITANCY AND HIRING

03:17:26.167 --> 03:17:28.069
SOMEONE IT OF THAT OF THAT

03:17:28.136 --> 03:17:30.438
BACKGROUND- IS THERE ANY SAFETY

03:17:30.505 --> 03:17:34.175
GUARDS OR ANY- I GUESS SAFETY

03:17:34.242 --> 03:17:35.510
GUARDS ARE SURE IS THAT WE

03:17:35.577 --> 03:17:38.846
COULD GIVE THE PUBLIC. TO BE

03:17:38.913 --> 03:17:42.383
MORE ACCEPTABLE OF. HIRING

03:17:42.450 --> 03:17:44.185
SOMEONE THAT HAS HAD PRIOR

03:17:44.252 --> 03:17:46.788
CONVICTIONS IN IN THEIR FIELD.

03:17:46.854 --> 03:17:49.424
WELL AGAIN THE WHOLE POINT IS

03:17:49.490 --> 03:17:52.560
TO HELP PEOPLE SHED THAT RECORD

03:17:52.627 --> 03:17:55.263
FROM THERE SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T

03:17:55.330 --> 03:17:57.932
HAVE A RECORD. COULD ALSO

03:17:57.999 --> 03:18:01.536
COMMIT THAT CRIME. SO IT OUR

03:18:01.603 --> 03:18:04.172
POINT IS HERE IS THAT LET'S

03:18:04.239 --> 03:18:07.275
TREAT THEM. SINCE THEY MET

03:18:07.342 --> 03:18:09.510
THEIR A GOOD CUPPA COMPLETED

03:18:09.577 --> 03:18:11.813
THEIR SENTENCE THEY'VE GONE TWO

03:18:11.879 --> 03:18:13.715
YEARS WITHOUT COMMITTING

03:18:13.781 --> 03:18:16.851
ANOTHER CRIME THAT LET THEM NOW

03:18:16.918 --> 03:18:18.753
MOVES FORWARD INSTEAD OF

03:18:18.820 --> 03:18:22.156
HOLDING THEM BACK- SOMEBODY WHO

03:18:22.223 --> 03:18:23.091
DOESN'T HAS NOT COMMITTED A

03:18:23.157 --> 03:18:26.194
CRIME IS JUST AS ABLE TO COMMIT

03:18:26.261 --> 03:18:28.496
A CRIME LIKE A BEZEL MEANT AS

03:18:28.563 --> 03:18:32.000
AND S. WE WANT TO YOU'D TREAT

03:18:32.066 --> 03:18:33.768
PEOPLE. AS EQUALS WHEN THEY

03:18:33.835 --> 03:18:35.970
COME FORWARD AND SAY I'VE DEALT

03:18:36.037 --> 03:18:37.405
WITH MY PAST I WANT TO MOVE

03:18:37.472 --> 03:18:40.742
FORWARD. GIVE ME A JOB. I'M

03:18:40.808 --> 03:18:43.411
GONNA WORK HARD FOR IT I TOOK

03:18:43.478 --> 03:18:45.913
CLASSES I'M PREPARED. ALL THAT

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:47.982
IS IN PLACE SO I THINK THAT'S

03:18:48.049 --> 03:18:49.784
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DO. DO YOU

03:18:49.851 --> 03:18:52.086
THINK THAT PERHAPS PEOPLE DON'T

03:18:52.153 --> 03:18:53.688
HAVE THE ABILITY TO.

03:18:53.755 --> 03:18:55.690
ACKNOWLEDGE AND VALIDATE THEIR

03:18:55.757 --> 03:18:57.525
PAST AS WELL AS WHEN YOU'RE

03:18:57.592 --> 03:18:58.726
HIRING HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

03:18:58.793 --> 03:19:00.395
DO THAT THE REASON I'M ASKING

03:19:00.461 --> 03:19:02.430
IN THE CONTEXT IN WHICH I'M AT

03:19:02.497 --> 03:19:04.032
STATING MAKING THAT STATEMENT

03:19:04.098 --> 03:19:06.534
IS. PEOPLE LIKE MY FAMILY

03:19:06.601 --> 03:19:08.603
MEMBER WHO HAS HIRED AT PEOPLE

03:19:08.670 --> 03:19:10.938
WHO'VE BEEN OUT WHO HAVE SERVED

03:19:11.005 --> 03:19:12.940
TIME I'M THINKING OF A PASTOR

03:19:13.007 --> 03:19:14.342
BRIAN FROM SCIENCE CENTER WHO

03:19:14.409 --> 03:19:15.710
HAS SERVED TIME IN OPENLY

03:19:15.777 --> 03:19:17.879
DISCUSSES- YOU KNOW IT'S VERY

03:19:17.945 --> 03:19:19.681
TRANSPARENT IN IN IN WHAT HE

03:19:19.747 --> 03:19:21.182
HAS DONE AND YET HAS BEEN ABLE

03:19:21.249 --> 03:19:23.284
TO MOVE FORWARD. DO YOU DO NOT

03:19:23.351 --> 03:19:28.156
BELIEVE THAT THAT IS CURRENTLY-

03:19:28.222 --> 03:19:29.957
CURRENTLY A REASON TO GIVE

03:19:30.024 --> 03:19:31.592
PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE

03:19:31.659 --> 03:19:33.494
TRANSPARENT AND ONLY AND IT

03:19:33.561 --> 03:19:36.431
AND- IT AND VALIDATE I THINK

03:19:36.497 --> 03:19:38.333
OUR LIFE EXPERIENCES MAKE US

03:19:38.399 --> 03:19:39.801
WHO WE ARE AND GIVES THAT THAT

03:19:39.867 --> 03:19:41.602
CHARACTER- DO YOU THINK THAT

03:19:41.669 --> 03:19:45.173
THAT. BUT PEOPLE DON'T DESERVE

03:19:45.239 --> 03:19:48.142
TO BE TRANSPARENT AND OWNING AB

03:19:48.209 --> 03:19:49.844
ONE ON ONE SIDE WHAT THEY'VE

03:19:49.911 --> 03:19:51.379
DONE IN THE PAST NUMBER TWO

03:19:51.446 --> 03:19:52.480
HAVING THE ABILITY TO SAY YOU

03:19:52.547 --> 03:19:54.048
KNOW WHAT I SEE YOU'VE DONE

03:19:54.115 --> 03:19:55.149
THIS BUT I SEE THAT YOU'VE DONE

03:19:55.216 --> 03:19:57.085
ALL OF THIS EXTRA WORK TO

03:19:57.151 --> 03:19:59.287
BETTER YOURSELF AND MOVE

03:19:59.354 --> 03:20:01.022
FORWARD IN YOUR LIFE SO MANY

03:20:01.089 --> 03:20:03.124
GIVE ME THAT SHOT. I THINK THE

03:20:03.191 --> 03:20:05.226
PROBLEM IS THAT. FAR MORE

03:20:05.293 --> 03:20:07.462
PEOPLE HAVE USE IT AGAINST THEM

03:20:07.528 --> 03:20:10.198
THEN THEY HAVE. USED IT AS A

03:20:10.264 --> 03:20:12.166
WAY OF HELPING THAT PERSON MOVE

03:20:12.233 --> 03:20:14.135
FORWARD. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM

03:20:14.202 --> 03:20:16.237
IS THAT THERE'S BEEN FAR TOO

03:20:16.304 --> 03:20:18.439
MUCH DISCRIMINATION AGAINST

03:20:18.506 --> 03:20:20.074
INDIVIDUALS BECAUSE OF THEIR

03:20:20.141 --> 03:20:22.110
RECORD. BECAUSE OF THE STIGMA.

03:20:22.176 --> 03:20:23.845
BECAUSE EVERYTHING THAT GOES

03:20:23.911 --> 03:20:25.646
ALONG WITH IT WE DEHUMANIZE-

03:20:25.713 --> 03:20:27.415
FOREVER THEY HAVE THIS THIS

03:20:27.482 --> 03:20:29.317
LABEL ON THEM. SO WHAT WE WANNA

03:20:29.384 --> 03:20:31.386
DO IS. ALLOW THEM TO MOVE

03:20:31.452 --> 03:20:33.020
FORWARD THAT'S THAT'S THE

03:20:33.087 --> 03:20:36.023
BOTTOM LINE. ALL RIGHT THANK

FOLKS WERE OUT THERE YOU KNOW

03:21:36.484 --> 03:21:37.785

03:21:37.852 --> 03:21:39.520
THINGS THAT JUST HAPPENED TO

03:21:39.587 --> 03:21:42.557
NOT GET CAUGHT- AND AT THE END

03:21:42.623 --> 03:21:43.491
OF THE DAY THEY PROBABLY ALL

03:21:43.558 --> 03:21:44.358

03:21:44.425 --> 03:21:46.627
MARKET. YOU KNOW HOW ARE WE

03:21:46.694 --> 03:21:49.497
WORKING TO. GIVE PEOPLE AN

03:21:49.564 --> 03:21:51.265
OPPORTUNITY TO BE SUCCESSFUL

03:21:51.332 --> 03:21:52.366
HOW ARE WE GIVING PEOPLE AN

03:21:52.433 --> 03:21:54.168
OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE AND HOW ARE

03:21:54.235 --> 03:21:55.736
WE GIVING PEOPLE AN OPPORTUNITY

03:21:55.803 --> 03:21:58.139
TO NOT BE DEFINED. BY PAST

03:21:58.206 --> 03:22:00.441
EXPERIENCES OR CIRCUMSTANCES I

03:22:00.508 --> 03:22:02.243
AM SURE THAT SO MANY OF US IF

03:22:02.310 --> 03:22:03.711
WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO GO

03:22:03.778 --> 03:22:05.613
BACK IN TIME. WE WOULD HAVE

03:22:05.680 --> 03:22:06.881
MADE A DIFFERENT DECISION ABOUT

03:22:06.948 --> 03:22:09.050
A PARTNER ABOUT A JOB. ABOUT

03:22:09.116 --> 03:22:10.818
SOMETHING WE SAID ABOUT HOW WE

03:22:10.885 --> 03:22:14.255
TREATED SOMEONE. AND BUT WE'RE

03:22:14.322 --> 03:22:16.057
NOT REALLY AFFORDED THAT- BUT

03:22:16.123 --> 03:22:17.959
WE DO HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO

03:22:18.025 --> 03:22:19.994
MEET PEOPLE WHERE THEY ARE AS

03:22:20.061 --> 03:22:22.663
IT RELATES TO EMPLOYMENT. AND

03:22:22.730 --> 03:22:24.899
ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES. AND

03:22:24.966 --> 03:22:26.467
WHEN WE CONTINUE TO SHUT THOSE

03:22:26.534 --> 03:22:30.171
DOORS. WE ACTUALLY FINAL PEOPLE

03:22:30.238 --> 03:22:32.640
BACK INTO A RE AND CARCERAL-

03:22:32.707 --> 03:22:36.377
PIPELINE. AND WE CREATE THE

03:22:36.444 --> 03:22:37.311
CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WE'RE TRYING

03:22:37.378 --> 03:22:40.214
TO. ON RAVEL HERE ON THIS VERY

03:22:40.281 --> 03:22:43.484
COMMITTEE- AND I ALSO THINK WE

03:22:43.551 --> 03:22:45.920
HAVE TO HAVE DEEPER DISCUSSIONS

03:22:45.987 --> 03:22:47.755
WITH OURSELVES ABOUT HOW MUCH

03:22:47.822 --> 03:22:50.925
WE WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE-

03:22:50.992 --> 03:22:52.426
AND THERE'S A FINE LINE BETWEEN

03:22:52.493 --> 03:22:54.896
GROSS INTRUSIVENESS. AND REALLY

03:22:54.962 --> 03:22:57.331
FINDING OUT YOU KNOW WHAT YOU

03:22:57.398 --> 03:22:58.566
NEED TO KNOW ABOUT SOMEONE IN

03:22:58.633 --> 03:23:01.502
ORDER TO EMPLOY THEM. AND WHEN

03:23:01.569 --> 03:23:04.939
TOO MUCH IS JUST TOO MUCH- I

03:23:05.006 --> 03:23:06.240
THINK THERE ARE PROBABLY A TON

03:23:06.307 --> 03:23:07.909
OF PEOPLE WHO ARE PRO REALLY

03:23:07.975 --> 03:23:10.611
GOOD C. P. A.'S OR ACCOUNTANTS

03:23:10.678 --> 03:23:12.813
OR SOCIAL WORKERS. WHO MIGHT

03:23:12.880 --> 03:23:14.348
HAVE DONE SOMETHING BAD EVEN IN

03:23:14.415 --> 03:23:16.784
THAT SAME. YOU KNOW FIELD OF

03:23:16.851 --> 03:23:19.620
WORK. AND IT DOESN'T MEAN THAT

03:23:19.687 --> 03:23:20.988
THEY'RE A BAD PERSON IT DOESN'T

03:23:21.055 --> 03:23:22.590
MEAN THAT THEY DESERVE THEY

03:23:22.657 --> 03:23:25.059
SHOULDN'T GET A SECOND CHANCE-

03:23:25.126 --> 03:23:26.394
AND IF THEY ARE REALLY

03:23:26.460 --> 03:23:28.195
EGREGIOUS AND CHANCES ARE THEY

03:23:28.262 --> 03:23:30.932
WILL DO SOMETHING BAD AGAIN-

03:23:30.998 --> 03:23:32.233
AND THEY WILL HAVE TO ACCOUNT

03:23:32.300 --> 03:23:34.368
FOR THAT SO. I REALLY APPLAUD

03:23:34.435 --> 03:23:37.471

03:23:37.538 --> 03:23:41.242

BELIEVE THE REFORM FIX THE

04:34:32.255 --> 04:34:34.925
PROBLEM. OUR COURTS ARE STILL

04:34:34.991 --> 04:34:36.760
REQUIRED TO STATE ON THE RECORD

04:34:36.827 --> 04:34:39.396
WHICH FAXIAN AGGRAVATION WERE

04:34:39.462 --> 04:34:41.898
FOUND TRUE BY THE JUDGE IN

04:34:41.965 --> 04:34:43.500
ORDER TO JUSTIFY AN OPPORTUNE.

04:34:43.567 --> 04:34:44.968
THIS IS EXACTLY THE SAME

04:34:45.035 --> 04:34:46.670
JUDICIALFACT FINDING THE

04:34:46.736 --> 04:34:47.037
CUNNINGHAM FOUND

04:34:47.103 --> 04:34:51.508
UNCONSTITUTIONAL. UNDER SB FIVE

04:34:51.575 --> 04:34:52.409
SIXTY SEVEN WHAT A PROSECUTOR

04:34:52.475 --> 04:34:53.944
THINKS THEY HAVE AN AGGRAVATED

04:34:54.010 --> 04:34:56.279
CASE THEY WILL ADD AGGRAVATING

04:34:56.346 --> 04:34:57.714
FACTORS TO THE INFORMATION

04:34:57.781 --> 04:34:59.216
WHICH CURRENTLY CHARGES FOR

04:34:59.282 --> 04:35:01.284
CRIMES AND ENHANCEMENTS. IF THE

04:35:01.351 --> 04:35:04.321
CASE GOES TO TRIAL AND ONLY

04:35:04.387 --> 04:35:04.955
THREE OUT OF A HUNDRED CASES GO

04:35:05.021 --> 04:35:06.823
TO TRIAL. THE COURT WILL

04:35:06.890 --> 04:35:08.124
BIFURCATE THE AGGRAVATING

04:35:08.191 --> 04:35:10.126
FACTORS AND THE JURY WILL

04:35:10.193 --> 04:35:11.528
RECEIVE EVIDENCE ON THE CHARGES

04:35:11.595 --> 04:35:13.830
IN HERE AND ENHANCEMENTS IF THE

04:35:13.897 --> 04:35:16.500
DEFENDANT IS FOUND GUILTY THEN

04:35:16.566 --> 04:35:18.635
THE AGGRAVATING FACTORS WOULD

04:35:18.702 --> 04:35:20.704
BE PRESENTED TO THE JURY.

04:35:20.770 --> 04:35:22.439
HOWEVER IN THE REAL WORLD THE

04:35:22.505 --> 04:35:24.074
STRUCTURE STEP WILL SELDOM

04:35:24.140 --> 04:35:27.944
OCCUR AND WILL TAKE VERY LITTLE

04:35:28.011 --> 04:35:29.446
COURT TIME OVERALL. FOR EXAMPLE

04:35:29.512 --> 04:35:31.314
IN CURRENT PRACTICE PRIOR

04:35:31.381 --> 04:35:32.949
CONVICTIONS OR BIFURCATED IN

04:35:33.016 --> 04:35:36.152
JUST THIS WAY. OFTEN THE

04:35:36.219 --> 04:35:38.421
DEFENDANT AFTER BEING CONVICTED

04:35:38.488 --> 04:35:40.557
WILL BAN ADMIT THE PRIORS OR

04:35:40.624 --> 04:35:42.359
WAIVE JURY AND WHAT THE COURT

04:35:42.425 --> 04:35:44.594
DECIDES THE PRIORS. AND THIS IS

04:35:44.661 --> 04:35:46.463
A VRY STANDARD PROCEDURE TODAY

04:35:46.529 --> 04:35:47.497
AND IT DOES NOT ADD

04:35:47.564 --> 04:35:48.798
SIGNIFICANTLY TO THE AVERAGE

04:35:48.865 --> 04:35:50.867
TIME FOR TRIALS IT'S VERY

04:35:50.934 --> 04:35:53.803
LIKELY THAT. SB FIVE SIXTY

04:35:53.870 --> 04:35:56.840
SEVEN WOULD CREATE A SIMILAR-

04:35:56.907 --> 04:35:58.275
EFFICIENT PROCESS OF

04:35:58.341 --> 04:35:59.910
DETERMINING THE AGGRAVATING

04:35:59.976 --> 04:36:03.313
FACTORS IN A TRIAL SITUATION.

04:36:03.380 --> 04:36:04.714
SO THE BILL DOES NOTHING TO

04:36:04.781 --> 04:36:06.883
LIMIT PROTECT PARTICIPATION OF

04:36:06.950 --> 04:36:09.452
VICTIMS IN THE CASE. THE VICTIM

04:36:09.519 --> 04:36:10.720
HAS A RIGHT TO EXPRESS VIEWS ON

04:36:10.787 --> 04:36:13.356
SENTENCING WAS SET UP IN

04:36:13.423 --> 04:36:15.692
PROPOSITION ONE FIFTEEN OTHERS-

04:36:15.759 --> 04:36:18.194
NEITHER. SECTIONALISM SEVENTY

04:36:18.261 --> 04:36:19.229
NOR THE STATE CONSTITUTION

04:36:19.296 --> 04:36:21.598
LIMIT WHAT THEY CAN SAY IF THE

04:36:21.665 --> 04:36:23.700
VICTIM WANTS TO ARGUE FOR THE

04:36:23.767 --> 04:36:25.568
DEATH PENALTY FOR AN EMBEZZLER.

04:36:25.635 --> 04:36:27.337
THEY'RE FREE TO DO THAT. BUT

04:36:27.404 --> 04:36:29.839
THE COURT CANNOT ORDER THAT

04:36:29.906 --> 04:36:33.877
UNLAWFUL ENTRY. WE CUNNINGHAM

04:36:33.944 --> 04:36:36.680
HOLDING WAS QUOTE THE STATUTORY

04:36:36.746 --> 04:36:39.416
MAXIMUM IS A MAXIMUM SENTENCE

04:36:39.482 --> 04:36:41.284

04:36:41.351 --> 04:36:43.620

DEFENDANT. TODAY A CALIFORNIA

04:36:47.490 --> 04:36:48.892

SPECIFICALLY FINDING SOME

04:36:52.629 --> 04:36:54.831
AGGRAVATING FACTORS. BUT THOSE

04:36:54.898 --> 04:36:56.199
FACTS HAVE NOT BEEN FOUND BY

04:36:56.266 --> 04:36:58.101
THE JURY OR ADMITTED BY THE

04:36:58.168 --> 04:37:00.136
DEFENDANT HENCE THE SYSTEM IS

04:37:00.203 --> 04:37:01.638
STILL A VIOLATION OF THE SIXTH

04:37:01.705 --> 04:37:04.407
AMENDMENT. SB FIVE SIXTY SEVEN
