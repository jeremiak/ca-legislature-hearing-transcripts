BY THE MID NINETEEN EIGHTIES-

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.015
AND- I DIDN'T HAPPEN. HERE IN

01:22:34.082 --> 01:22:37.052
CALIFORNIA. OVER 95% OF THE

WHAT WATER QUALITY STANDARDS

01:22:42.957 --> 01:22:45.727
ALLOW. AND THAT'S ACCORDING TO

01:22:45.794 --> 01:22:47.529
THE MOST RECENT WATER BOARD

OF THEM SUPPLIER DRINKING WATER

01:23:01.009 --> 01:23:03.578
AND ALL OF THEM SUPPORT OUR

DIVERSE ECOSYSTEM HERE. IN THE

01:23:05.914 --> 01:23:07.649
GREAT STATE OF CALIFORNIA. AND

01:23:07.716 --> 01:23:09.217
EVERY AREA OF OUR STATE DEALS

01:23:09.284 --> 01:23:11.720
WITH THE IMPACTS OF THESE

01:23:11.786 --> 01:23:12.220
POLLUTANTS IN OUR LOCAL

LOS ANGELES AREA WON'T FULLY

01:23:19.561 --> 01:23:21.696
CLEAN UP STORMWATER POLLUTION.

01:23:21.763 --> 01:23:23.798
AND ACHIEVE IT'S- IT'S

01:23:23.865 --> 01:23:25.800
COLLECTIVE CLEAN WATER GOAL

01:23:25.867 --> 01:23:27.702
INTO THE TWENTY EIGHTIES.

01:23:27.769 --> 01:23:29.504
TWENTY EIGHTIES AND THAT'S THE

01:23:29.571 --> 01:23:33.041
BEST CASE SCENARIO. PART OF THE

01:23:33.108 --> 01:23:34.142
CENTRAL VALLEY NOW FACE SOME OF

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:35.777
THE HIGHEST WATER TREATMENT

01:23:35.844 --> 01:23:37.712
COSTS IN THE STATE BECAUSE THEY

01:23:37.779 --> 01:23:39.681
HAVE NO CHOICE OR BECAUSE THEY

01:23:39.748 --> 01:23:41.416
HAVE TO CHOOSE WHETHER TO GET

01:23:41.483 --> 01:23:42.450
DRINKING WATER FROM THE SAN

01:23:42.517 --> 01:23:44.185
JOAQUIN RIVER WHICH HAS SOME

01:23:44.252 --> 01:23:45.987
POLLUTION WITH- TODAY JUST

01:23:46.054 --> 01:23:47.922
LEVELS OF MERCURY. OR THEY CAN

01:23:47.989 --> 01:23:50.225
CHOOSE TO GO TO NEARBY LAKES

01:23:50.291 --> 01:23:50.825
AND RESERVOIRS THAT HIT THEY

01:23:50.892 --> 01:23:53.027
DON'T EVEN HAVE HAVE HAVE EVEN

01:23:53.094 --> 01:23:54.896
STRONGER US SOME POLLUTANTS OF

01:23:54.963 --> 01:23:58.566
MERCURY. THESE COMMUNITIES THAT

01:23:58.633 --> 01:24:00.535
ALREADY LACK ACCESS TO RELIABLE

01:24:00.602 --> 01:24:01.669
SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING

01:24:01.736 --> 01:24:04.739
WATER. IT IT'S A PROBLEM MADE

01:24:04.806 --> 01:24:06.975
WORSE BY THIS POLLUTION YEAH ON

01:24:07.041 --> 01:24:08.576
THE NORTH COAST TRIBAL CULTURAL

01:24:08.643 --> 01:24:09.978
PRACTICES ARE BEING WIPED OUT

01:24:10.044 --> 01:24:11.546
BECAUSE OF SEDIMENTATION IN

01:24:11.613 --> 01:24:13.782
STREAMS. HAS DESTROYED SALMON

01:24:13.848 --> 01:24:15.917
POPULATIONS. AND IN MY OWN

01:24:15.984 --> 01:24:18.453
COUNTY SAN BENITO. THERE ARE

01:24:18.520 --> 01:24:20.688
OVER A HUNDRED MILES OF RIVERS

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:21.589
AND STREAMS THAT ARE PAIRED

01:24:21.656 --> 01:24:23.625
WITH E. COLI PESTICIDES HEAVY

01:24:23.691 --> 01:24:25.827
METALS AND OTHER POLLUTANTS AND

01:24:25.894 --> 01:24:28.329
THIS IS JUST IN ONE SMALL SMALL

01:24:28.396 --> 01:24:30.932
COUNTY HERE IN OUR STATE. AND

01:24:30.999 --> 01:24:32.000
DESPITE THESE GRIM EXAMPLES WE

01:24:32.066 --> 01:24:33.268
HAVE MADE SIGNIFICANT

01:24:33.334 --> 01:24:34.936
SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS- AS A

01:24:35.003 --> 01:24:36.538
PROGRESS IMPROVING WATER

01:24:36.604 --> 01:24:38.006
QUALITY SINCE THE PASSAGE OF

01:24:38.072 --> 01:24:39.441
THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT.

01:24:39.507 --> 01:24:43.878
FIFTY YEARS AGO- THERE WAS SO

01:24:43.945 --> 01:24:44.479
MUCH RAW SEWAGE IN THE SENATE

01:24:44.546 --> 01:24:46.314
IS KOBE. THAT IT LITERALLY

01:24:46.381 --> 01:24:49.951
STANK. AND NOW AFTER MAJOR

01:24:50.018 --> 01:24:51.886
INVESTMENTS IN TREATMENT PLANTS

01:24:51.953 --> 01:24:53.855
WATER QUALITY IS DRAMATICALLY

01:24:53.922 --> 01:24:54.422
IMPROVED AND WHILE LIFE HAS

01:24:54.489 --> 01:24:56.391
RETURNED TO THE BAY. AND

01:24:56.458 --> 01:24:57.559
CLEARLY WE HAVE THE TOOLS AND

01:24:57.625 --> 01:24:59.494
TECHNOLOGY TO ACHIEVE CLEAN

01:24:59.561 --> 01:25:01.196
WATER FOR ALL IN THIS STATE.

01:25:01.262 --> 01:25:02.764
AND WE CAN DO IT WITHIN OUR

01:25:02.831 --> 01:25:06.234
LIFETIMES. IF WE ACT NOW. SO

01:25:06.301 --> 01:25:07.402
THIS BILL TE CALIFORNIA CLEAN

01:25:07.469 --> 01:25:08.703
WATER ACT AIMS TO CHEAPLY WATER

01:25:08.770 --> 01:25:10.805
IN OUR STATE BY TWENTY FIFTY.

01:25:10.872 --> 01:25:11.906
AND TO DO SO IT HAS THREE PARTS

01:25:11.973 --> 01:25:13.942
FIRST IT REQUIRES THE STATE AND

01:25:14.008 --> 01:25:15.143
REGIONAL WATER BOARDS TO

01:25:15.210 --> 01:25:17.111
DEVELOP A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN. A

01:25:17.178 --> 01:25:19.247
COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO ACHIEVE

01:25:19.314 --> 01:25:21.249
CLEAN WATER BY TWENTY FIFTY-

01:25:21.316 --> 01:25:22.417
THIS PLANNING EXERCISE WILL

01:25:22.484 --> 01:25:23.885
ALLOW THEM TO USE. ALL TOOLS AT

01:25:23.952 --> 01:25:26.054
THEIR DISPOSAL TO FIND THE BEST

01:25:26.120 --> 01:25:27.655
MOST COST EFFECTIVE PATHWAY TO

01:25:27.722 --> 01:25:29.624
ACHIEVE CLEAN WATER. AND SECOND

01:25:29.691 --> 01:25:30.859
IT REQUIRES THE WATER BOARDS TO

01:25:30.925 --> 01:25:32.861
FOCUS ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS. ON

01:25:32.927 --> 01:25:35.363
WORST VIOLATORS. IN THE MOST

01:25:35.430 --> 01:25:37.499
IMPAIRED WATERWAYS. ENSURING

01:25:37.565 --> 01:25:38.399
THAT WE'RE GETTING THE MOST

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:39.767
BANG FOR OUR BUCK ON THE

01:25:39.834 --> 01:25:41.736
ENFORCEMENT FRONT. IT'LL ALSO

01:25:41.803 --> 01:25:43.471
MAKE IT EASIER FOR WATER BOARDS

01:25:43.538 --> 01:25:44.572
TO RECOVER THEIR ENFORCEMENT

01:25:44.639 --> 01:25:47.742
COSTS AS A NUMBER OF OTHER

01:25:47.809 --> 01:25:48.343
AGENCIES IN THE STATE ALREADY

01:25:48.409 --> 01:25:50.512
DO. AND SO THAT DISCHARGERS WHO

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:52.313
ARE COMPLYING WITH THE LAW

01:25:52.380 --> 01:25:53.147
DON'T HAVE TO SUBSIDIZE THE

01:25:53.214 --> 01:25:56.985
COST. OF GOING AFTER BAD ACTORS.

01:25:57.051 --> 01:25:58.386
IT'S ALL FINALLY THIS

01:25:58.453 --> 01:26:00.355
LEGISLATION AB THREE SEVEN

01:26:00.421 --> 01:26:01.289
SEVEN WILL RE ALLOCATE SOME

01:26:01.356 --> 01:26:03.091
EXISTING MONEY AT THE WATER

01:26:03.157 --> 01:26:03.925
BOARD WITHOUT RAISING NEW

01:26:03.992 --> 01:26:06.327
REVENUES- TO PAY FOR

01:26:06.394 --> 01:26:07.795
REMEDIATION OF THE MOST

01:26:07.862 --> 01:26:08.396
IMPAIRED WATERWAYS HERE IN OUR

01:26:08.463 --> 01:26:11.165
STATE. AND AS HAVE AS YOU HAVE

01:26:11.232 --> 01:26:13.034
NO DOUBT NOTICED THIS BILL HAS

01:26:13.101 --> 01:26:15.603
UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN

01:26:15.670 --> 01:26:16.104
RESPONSE TO SOME OF THE

01:26:16.170 --> 01:26:18.940
CONCERNS WE'VE HEARD. I HAVE A

01:26:19.007 --> 01:26:22.443
HAND OUT THAT I HAD TO DO TO

01:26:22.510 --> 01:26:25.880
THE SECRETARY TO YELLOW PAGE-

01:26:25.947 --> 01:26:27.148
WHERE IT SHOWS ALL THE

01:26:27.215 --> 01:26:28.650
AMENDMENTS WE HAVE MADE AND

01:26:28.716 --> 01:26:30.652
THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE

01:26:30.718 --> 01:26:32.120
WE ARE COMPLETELY OPEN TO

01:26:32.186 --> 01:26:33.054
WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS WE'VE

01:26:33.121 --> 01:26:35.189
ENGAGED STAKEHOLDERS- IN

01:26:35.256 --> 01:26:37.158
SUPPORT AND OPPOSITION. EVERY

01:26:37.225 --> 01:26:40.495
STEP. OF THE WAY THE TO THIS

01:26:40.562 --> 01:26:43.898
COMMITTEE- AND YOU KNOW THIS IS

01:26:43.965 --> 01:26:45.800
AN ISSUE THAT'S WHERE THE OF

01:26:45.867 --> 01:26:49.237
OUR DEBATE. WE SHOULD. ALL COME

01:26:49.304 --> 01:26:50.939
TO THE NEGOTIATION TABLE TO

01:26:51.005 --> 01:26:52.040
FIGURE OUT HOW WE CAN FINALLY

01:26:52.106 --> 01:26:54.375
CLEAN UP OUR WATERWAYS WHEN WE

01:26:54.442 --> 01:26:56.511
READ IN THE L. A. TIMES AT.

01:26:56.578 --> 01:26:57.078
SOME POLLUTION DUE TO

01:26:57.145 --> 01:26:58.446
STORMWATER WILL BE CLEANED UP

01:26:58.513 --> 01:27:00.281
AND TOP POSSIBLY TWENTY EIGHTY.

01:27:00.348 --> 01:27:05.086
UNACCEPTABLE. AND SO THERE'S

01:27:05.153 --> 01:27:05.853
MANY THINGS WE HAVE DONE IT YOU

01:27:05.920 --> 01:27:07.822
KNOW- THAT WE'VE REMOVED A

01:27:07.889 --> 01:27:08.923
PROHIBITION ON THE WATER

01:27:08.990 --> 01:27:10.692
BOARD'S DEEMING IN COMPLIANCE

01:27:10.758 --> 01:27:12.493
ENTITIES THAT ARE. NOT ACTUALLY

01:27:12.560 --> 01:27:15.597
IN COMPLIANCE. WE REMOVE LIMITS

01:27:15.663 --> 01:27:18.232
ON THE TOOLS AND TIME FRAMES OF

01:27:18.299 --> 01:27:20.301
DISCHARGES CAN USE TO COME INTO

01:27:20.368 --> 01:27:22.270
COMPLIANCE WE'VE NARROWED THE

02:07:14.626 --> 02:07:17.363
ABOUT LANGUAGE WHAT IT'S ABOUT

02:07:17.429 --> 02:07:19.231
IS THE JYJ COST THAT IT'S GOING

02:07:19.298 --> 02:07:20.599
TO TAKE TO MEET THE SENATE AND

02:07:20.666 --> 02:07:22.901
I CAN GO INTO SOME OF THE

02:07:22.968 --> 02:07:25.471
CONCERNS ON THE LANGUAGE WHICH-

02:07:25.537 --> 02:07:27.606
I WANT AT THIS TIME BUT- IT

02:07:27.673 --> 02:07:29.308
REALLY IS ABOUT THE MONEY IF

02:07:29.375 --> 02:07:30.909
WE'RE GOING TO TREAT. ALL OF

02:07:30.976 --> 02:07:39.885
OUR- STORM RUNOFF. AS WELL TO

02:07:39.952 --> 02:07:41.420
TREATED IN AS N THE WAY THAT

02:07:41.487 --> 02:07:44.023
WE TREAT OUR SEWAGE WHICH IS AT

02:07:44.089 --> 02:07:44.790
SOME POINT WHAT'S GOING TO BE

02:07:44.857 --> 02:07:47.126
NECESSARY IT'S REALLY REALLY

02:07:47.192 --> 02:07:48.627
EXPENSIVE AND WHEN I WAS ON A

02:07:48.694 --> 02:07:50.629
WHICH CITY COUNCIL I WAS TOLD

02:07:50.696 --> 02:07:53.899
THOSE ISUNFUNDED MANDATE

02:07:53.966 --> 02:07:54.466
COMING AND WE DON'T KNOW HOW

02:07:54.533 --> 02:07:56.568
WE'RE GOING TO FORWARD IT. AND

02:07:56.635 --> 02:07:59.138
I DON'T KNOW THAT EITHER- I DO

02:07:59.204 --> 02:08:01.440
KNOW THAT IT'S GOT TO BE DONE

02:08:01.507 --> 02:08:04.143
RIGHT NOW WE ARE PUTTING. ALSO

02:08:04.209 --> 02:08:05.744
OF IT WE HAD A HURT HEARING

02:08:05.811 --> 02:08:07.246
EARLIER WE'RE PUTTING ALL SORTS

02:08:07.312 --> 02:08:08.647
OF PLASTIC IN TE WATER IN THIS

02:08:08.714 --> 02:08:10.115
PREDOMINANTLY COMING FROM STORM

02:08:10.182 --> 02:08:12.785
RUNOFF. IT'S PROBABLY PLASTIC

02:08:12.851 --> 02:08:19.224
FROM. DRYERS THAT- PUT- PLASTIC

02:08:19.291 --> 02:08:20.759
OUT INTO THE AIR AND THEY'RE

02:08:20.826 --> 02:08:25.531
EXHAUSTED- LATER. ALL SORTS OF

02:08:25.597 --> 02:08:26.899
THINGS THAT FRANKLY WON'T BE

02:08:26.965 --> 02:08:28.600
SOLVED WITH RECYCLING AS MUCH

02:08:28.667 --> 02:08:30.335
AS POSSIBLE WOULD LIKE TO SAY

02:08:30.402 --> 02:08:32.471
IT'S THE WAY WERE LIVING. SO I

02:08:32.538 --> 02:08:33.672
DON'T THINK THERE IS A SOLUTION

02:08:33.739 --> 02:08:34.907
TO THAT OTHER THAN TREATING THE

02:08:34.973 --> 02:08:36.542
STORM WATER BUT IT'S HELLO

02:08:36.608 --> 02:08:41.146
EXTENSIVE. SO I THINK WE HAVE

02:08:41.213 --> 02:08:42.481
TO START BEING REALISTIC WHICH

02:08:42.548 --> 02:08:44.683
IS IF WE REALLY WANT THE CLEAN

02:08:44.750 --> 02:08:47.019
WATER WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH

02:08:47.086 --> 02:08:47.519
THE PLAN THAT'LL INCLUDE

02:08:47.586 --> 02:08:52.124
FINDING- AND THAT COULD BE.

02:08:52.191 --> 02:08:53.358
PROBABLY A HUNDRED BILLION

02:08:53.425 --> 02:08:55.994
DOLLARS OR MORE. SO IT'S NOT

02:08:56.061 --> 02:08:57.696
SMALL AND THAT'S JUST TALKING

02:08:57.763 --> 02:08:59.832
ABOUT CITIES AND SEWAGE

02:08:59.898 --> 02:09:01.166
AGENCIES BUT THAT'S REALLY WHAT

02:09:01.233 --> 02:09:03.135
THIS IS BALLOT IT'S A GOING TO

02:09:03.202 --> 02:09:04.536
BE EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE TO GET

02:09:04.603 --> 02:09:08.807
THERE. I HAVE ALSO AND SO I

02:09:08.874 --> 02:09:10.476
HAVE CONCERNS AND WE'RE GONNA

02:09:10.542 --> 02:09:12.211
HAVE TO FIND A SOLUTION AT THE

02:09:12.277 --> 02:09:13.779
STATE LEVEL PER A THE FOR.

02:09:13.846 --> 02:09:16.748
LEVEL A LOT OF THESE DISTRICTS

02:09:16.815 --> 02:09:17.983
JUST AREN'T GOING TO HAVE THE

02:09:18.050 --> 02:09:20.185
MONEY AND SOME OF THE OTHER

02:09:20.252 --> 02:09:22.221
DISTRICTS MIGHT BUT IT'S GOING

02:09:22.287 --> 02:09:25.557
TO TAKE A LOT ON THE-

02:09:25.624 --> 02:09:27.493
AGRICULTURAL SIDE WHAT ONE OF

02:09:27.559 --> 02:09:30.496
THE OPPOSITION LEADER SAID WAS.

02:09:30.562 --> 02:09:31.663
UP WE DON'T EVEN KNOW HOW TO DO

02:09:31.730 --> 02:09:34.066
THIS WELL WE'D BETTER FIGURE

02:09:34.133 --> 02:09:37.569
OUT HOW TO DO THIS. OUR WATER

02:09:37.636 --> 02:09:41.573
IS PRECIOUS. AND WE'RE LOSING

02:09:41.640 --> 02:09:44.009
SPECIES EVERY YEAR THIS IS THE

02:09:44.076 --> 02:09:46.044
TIME OF THE ANTHROPOCENE THE

02:09:46.111 --> 02:09:50.482
TIME WHEN MAN IS THE MAJOR.

02:09:50.549 --> 02:09:54.653
IMPACTOR ON OUR GEOLOGY. WHAT

02:09:54.720 --> 02:09:59.224
ARE CLIMATE. WE'VE GOT TO

02:09:59.291 --> 02:10:01.627
FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT WE CAN

02:10:01.693 --> 02:10:04.463
PRESERVE THE FRESH WATER THAT

02:10:04.530 --> 02:10:07.432
WE NEED SO MUCH. THE BOUNTY OF

02:10:07.499 --> 02:10:11.570
THE SEA. AND IF WE DON'T PLAN

02:10:11.637 --> 02:10:13.305
IT'S GOING TO GO ON IT SEEMS

02:10:13.372 --> 02:10:15.040
LOTS A MASS EXTINCTIONS DO WE

02:10:15.107 --> 02:10:16.875
WANT TO BE THE CAUSE OF ANOTHER

02:10:16.942 --> 02:10:18.877
ONE AND PERHAPS EVEN OF OUR OWN.

02:10:18.944 --> 02:10:20.045
WE DON'T DO SOMETHING THAT'S

02:10:20.112 --> 02:10:21.847
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN SO THIS.

02:10:21.914 --> 02:10:23.749
THIS BILL IS IMPORTANT BECAUSE

02:10:23.815 --> 02:10:25.417
IT SAYS THAT THEY HAVE TO COME

02:10:25.484 --> 02:10:26.518
UP WITH AND- A COMPREHENSIVE

02:10:26.585 --> 02:10:28.220
PLAN. AND THAT'S GOING TO HAVE

02:10:28.287 --> 02:10:29.821
TO INCLUDE WHERE IS THE MONEY

02:10:29.888 --> 02:10:33.025
COMING FROM. AND HOW DO WE GET

02:10:33.091 --> 02:10:35.160
A HOLD OF AGRICULTURAL WASTE.

02:10:35.227 --> 02:10:37.763
WE ALREADY KNOW FROM- PROBLEMS

02:10:37.829 --> 02:10:39.831
OF THE GROUND WATER WHAT EXCESS

02:10:39.898 --> 02:10:43.202
NITROGEN. FERTILIZER TED. WE'VE

02:10:43.268 --> 02:10:44.836
GOT TO FIND THESE PROBLEMS AND

02:10:44.903 --> 02:10:47.172
SOLVE THEM OR- IS HE SAID THE

02:10:47.239 --> 02:10:49.274
PLAN IT WILL GO ON FINE BUT WE

02:10:49.341 --> 02:10:52.010
WON'T. AND THAT'S MY CONCLUSION

02:10:52.077 --> 02:10:54.079

CHAMPIONS FOR ITS USE AS A

02:46:01.818 --> 02:46:03.787
PESTICIDE TODAY DDT IS

02:46:03.853 --> 02:46:05.622
RECOGNIZED AS ONE OF THE FIRST.

PELICANS AND CORMORANTS. THIS

02:46:39.923 --> 02:46:41.624
IS A THIS IS TRULY DEVASTATING

02:46:41.691 --> 02:46:42.992
TO OUR FRAGILE OCEANIC

02:46:43.059 --> 02:46:45.128
ECOSYSTEMS AS DDT IS NEARLY

02:46:45.195 --> 02:46:47.163
IMPOSSIBLE TO REMOVE FROM THE

02:46:47.230 --> 02:46:49.165

SPECIES. ALL THESE PROBLEMS

02:46:53.103 --> 02:46:54.504
HAVE BEEN MADE EVEN WORSE BY

02:46:54.571 --> 02:46:55.739
THE CARELESSNESS OF THOSE

ONLY BEEN RUMORED BEFORE THAT

02:47:27.404 --> 02:47:28.538
THOUSANDS OF BARRELS FILLED

02:47:30.607 --> 02:47:33.510
BARGED OUT OVER THE OPEN OCEAN

02:47:33.576 --> 02:47:35.812
AND TOSSED INTO THE WATER JUST

02:47:35.879 --> 02:47:37.547
TOSS OFF A SHIP. IN SOME

ORIGINALLY DISPOSING OF THEM TO

02:47:44.621 --> 02:47:46.156
ENSURE THAT THEY WOULD SINK. TO

THE OCEAN FLOOR. A PRACTICE

02:47:48.358 --> 02:47:49.859
THAT NEARLY GUARANTEED THEIR

02:47:56.266 --> 02:47:57.600
THAT MORE THAN SEVEN HUNDRED

02:47:57.667 --> 02:47:58.768
FIFTY TONS OF WASTE COULD HAVE

02:47:58.835 --> 02:47:59.569

IMPORTANT THE THING THAT MAKES

02:56:30.313 --> 02:56:33.783
DDT DIFFERENT. IS THAT IT STAYS

02:56:33.849 --> 02:56:35.051

BALD EAGLES AND WE FOUND IT IS

02:56:53.803 --> 02:56:55.304
BECAUSE DDT PERSISTS IN THE

02:56:55.371 --> 02:56:57.306

02:56:57.373 --> 02:57:01.077
