ABOUT THE FACT IT.

02:15:08.166 --> 02:15:10.469
OF HURTING OUR CHILDREN AND THIS

02:15:10.535 --> 02:15:12.304
IS A BILL THAT BASICALLY HELPS

US TO BASICALLY RESTORE THEIR

02:15:14.139 --> 02:15:15.841

RESOURCE AREAS THAT WE SHOULD BE

02:15:21.713 --> 02:15:22.614
REMOVING RATHER THAN PUTTING

WE CAN PROVIDE THESE CHILDREN

MORE APPROPRIATE SERVICES THAT

02:15:27.252 --> 02:15:28.687
WILL SHIFT THEIR BEHAVIOR AND

02:15:28.753 --> 02:15:29.955
PUT THEM ON A PATH TO PRODUCTIVE

02:15:30.021 --> 02:15:31.756
MEMBERS OF SOCIETY.

02:15:31.823 --> 02:15:33.191
BECAUSE IT IS EVIDENT THAT THE

02:15:33.258 --> 02:15:34.626
SYSTEM IS NOT IMPROVING THE

02:15:34.693 --> 02:15:36.127
LIVES OF THESE CHILDREN.

02:15:36.194 --> 02:15:37.229
ACOSTA AFFILIATED WOULD

02:15:37.295 --> 02:15:39.197

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE LIVES OF

02:15:49.074 --> 02:15:51.109

HAVE INTO WORD AS LITTLE KIDS.

02:20:32.090 --> 02:20:34.325
CANNOT SOLVE A PROBLEM FOR A

02:20:34.392 --> 02:20:36.027

THAT THEY DON'T EVEN NECESSARILY

02:20:56.748 --> 02:20:59.517
UNDERSTAND WHY OR WHAT THEY DID

02:20:59.584 --> 02:21:01.052
TO LOCK UP A KID TO THROW THEM

02:21:01.119 --> 02:21:02.921
IN COURT IS GOING TO TURN THAT

02:21:02.987 --> 02:21:05.456
CHILD AWAY FROM THE THERAPEUTIC

02:21:05.523 --> 02:21:06.724

THE THINGS IN THEIR LIVES THAT

02:21:09.627 --> 02:21:11.262

THE FAMILY SUPPORT THAT THEY

02:21:33.852 --> 02:21:35.186

02:21:35.253 --> 02:21:36.187
TO PUT THE CHILD IN THAT

02:21:36.254 --> 02:21:37.889

THANK YOU MANAGE SPEAKER I THINK

02:21:58.710 --> 02:21:59.544
ONE THING IS MISSING FROM THIS

02:21:59.611 --> 02:22:01.946
DEBATE IS --

02:22:02.013 --> 02:22:03.248
YOUR NEPHEW READ SOME OF THE

02:22:03.314 --> 02:22:05.650
ANALYSIS IF YOU LOOK AT DOJ'S

02:22:05.717 --> 02:22:07.685
OWN STATISTICS CHILLER TWELVER

02:22:07.752 --> 02:22:09.020
RARELY EVER.

02:22:09.087 --> 02:22:10.321
INCARCERATED IN A LOCKED

02:22:10.388 --> 02:22:11.189
FACILITY IN THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

02:22:11.256 --> 02:22:13.024
SYSTEM.

02:22:13.091 --> 02:22:14.525
AND IN FACT BEING UNDER THE

02:22:14.592 --> 02:22:16.094
JURISDICTION OF THE OF JUVENILE

02:22:16.160 --> 02:22:17.962
DETENTION.

02:22:18.029 --> 02:22:19.497
OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:22:19.564 --> 02:22:21.165
ALLOWS.

02:22:21.232 --> 02:22:23.134
FOR REFERRALS TO SERVICES.

02:22:23.201 --> 02:22:24.569
IN FACT SOME PLACES WILL NOT

02:22:24.636 --> 02:22:27.138
EVEN TAKE SOMEONE.

02:22:27.205 --> 02:22:28.907
THESE CHARITABLE GROUPS THESE

02:22:28.973 --> 02:22:30.775
THESE THESE HOMES USED TO PLACES

02:22:30.842 --> 02:22:32.176
WHERE THERE ARE SERVICES TO HELP

02:22:32.243 --> 02:22:33.311
YOUNG PEOPLE.

02:22:33.378 --> 02:22:34.512
THEY WON'T EVEN TAKE SOMEONE

02:22:34.579 --> 02:22:36.848
UNLESS THERE IS A COURT REFERRAL.

02:22:36.915 --> 02:22:38.549
AND IN THIS BILL THERE'S NOTHING

02:22:38.616 --> 02:22:41.886
THAT PROVIDES FOR THOSE SERVICES.

02:22:41.953 --> 02:22:43.354
ALL IT SAYS IS THAT THEY'RE JUST

02:22:43.421 --> 02:22:43.888
NOT GOING TO BE UNDER THE

02:22:43.955 --> 02:22:45.356
JURISDICTION.

02:22:45.423 --> 02:22:47.258
OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE SYSTEM

02:22:47.325 --> 02:22:48.826
IN THIS STATE SO IT DOESN'T

02:22:48.893 --> 02:22:50.862
ACTUALLY PROVIDE THOSE OTHER

02:22:50.929 --> 02:22:51.863
WAYS OTHER DIVERSION

02:22:51.930 --> 02:22:52.163

02:22:52.230 --> 02:22:55.233

LONGER OF THE JUVENILE JUSTICE

02:22:58.836 --> 02:23:01.005
SYSTEM SO IT DOESN'T SOLVE THE

02:23:01.072 --> 02:23:02.941
PROBLEM THAT I THINK.

02:23:03.007 --> 02:23:03.508
MANY PEOPLE WHO STOOD UP AND

02:23:03.574 --> 02:23:05.743
SAID -- IS

02:23:05.810 --> 02:23:07.178
THE REASON FOR THIS BILL DOESN'T

02:23:07.245 --> 02:23:09.047
SOLVE THAT ISSUE AND SO

02:23:09.113 --> 02:23:11.516
[inaudible] TO ME.

02:23:11.582 --> 02:23:13.251
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON HEY HOW

02:23:13.318 --> 02:23:14.118
DO WE IMPROVE THE JUVENILE

02:23:14.185 --> 02:23:15.687
JUSTICE SYSTEM HOW DO WE ENSURE

02:23:15.753 --> 02:23:16.988
THAT PEOPLE ARE GETTING IN THOSE

02:23:17.055 --> 02:23:17.288
[inaudible]

02:23:17.355 --> 02:23:19.424
PROPER SERVICES WE SHOULDN'T

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.759
JUST TAKE THEM OUT OF THE SYSTEM.

02:23:21.826 --> 02:23:22.961
AND HAVE NO WAY FOR PROVIDING

02:23:23.027 --> 02:23:25.797
THOSE COULD TYPE OF SERVICES. TO

02:23:25.863 --> 02:23:26.965
TO THESE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO MAY BE

02:23:27.031 --> 02:23:27.932
ON ALERT A WRONG PATH THAT

02:23:27.999 --> 02:23:29.600
EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WANTS TO

02:23:29.667 --> 02:23:33.071
SEE THEM GET ON THE RIGHT PATH --

02:23:33.137 --> 02:23:34.339
AND IT ALSO DOESN'T TAKE INTO

02:23:34.405 --> 02:23:35.106
ACCOUNT THERE ARE SOME VERY

02:23:35.173 --> 02:23:37.909
SERIOUS CRIMES --

02:23:37.976 --> 02:23:39.877
OFTEN THAT THEY CAN BE THE CASE

02:23:39.944 --> 02:23:41.646
HERE AND IF WE DON'T.

02:23:41.713 --> 02:23:42.947
DO SOMETHING ABOUT THAT THERE'S

02:23:43.014 --> 02:23:45.116
NOT CONSEQUENCES AND THERE'S NOT

02:23:45.183 --> 02:23:46.718
THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES.

02:23:46.784 --> 02:23:47.852
WE AREN'T GOING TO GET THOSE

02:23:47.919 --> 02:23:49.554
PEOPLE BACK ON THE RIGHT PATH SO

02:23:49.620 --> 02:23:50.688

THE SHERIFF CORNER MODEL

04:11:48.793 --> 04:11:51.029
FRUSTRATES THIS GOAL BY PLACING

IN THIS SPECIFIC CASE THE

04:12:38.510 --> 04:12:40.678

EVEN THOUGH THE SHERIFF CORNER

04:13:03.701 --> 04:13:06.404

04:44:14.837 --> 04:44:16.839
TO THE REST THE NATION.

04:44:16.906 --> 04:44:18.508
BUT WE ALSO STAND STRONG HERE

04:44:18.574 --> 04:44:20.777
AND MAKE A STATEMENT.

04:44:20.843 --> 04:44:23.446
THAT A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET.

04:44:23.513 --> 04:44:25.348
IS ESSENTIAL TO OUR DEMOCRACY

04:44:25.415 --> 04:44:26.582
AND WE HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY TO

04:44:26.649 --> 04:44:28.217
DO THAT NOW.

04:44:28.284 --> 04:44:29.652
THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I

THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION I

04:44:45.101 --> 04:44:46.035
THINK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS

04:44:46.102 --> 04:44:48.337
ACTUALLY FRAME THE QUESTION WELL.

04:44:48.404 --> 04:44:50.440
NETS SHOULD CALIFORNIA HAVE ITS

04:44:50.506 --> 04:44:51.808
OWN INTERNET RULES SHOULD

04:44:51.874 --> 04:44:53.576
CALIFORNIA HAVE ITS LAWS THAT

04:44:53.643 --> 04:44:55.745
GOVERN THE INTERNET.

04:44:55.812 --> 04:44:57.079
OR SHOULD IT BE.

04:44:57.146 --> 04:44:59.048
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT.

04:44:59.115 --> 04:45:02.385
OR SHOULD BE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS.

04:45:02.452 --> 04:45:04.120
IF INDEED YOU'RE UPSET WITH HOW

04:45:04.187 --> 04:45:05.054
THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS

04:45:05.121 --> 04:45:07.290
HANDLED THIS THIS ISSUE IS THIS

04:45:07.356 --> 04:45:08.991
SIMPLY VENUE SHOPPING.

04:45:09.058 --> 04:45:10.426
TRY TO GET TO WHERE YOU THINK

04:45:10.493 --> 04:45:12.728
YOU HAVE THE VOTES. TO BE ABLE

04:45:12.795 --> 04:45:13.296
TO DECIDE HOW TO GOVERN THE

04:45:13.362 --> 04:45:14.931
INTERNET.

04:45:14.997 --> 04:45:17.533
AND IF NOT HERE.

04:45:17.600 --> 04:45:19.101
WHY SHOULDN'T IT BE HANDLED AT

04:45:19.168 --> 04:45:21.137
THE LOCAL LEVEL PERHAPS WHY

04:45:21.204 --> 04:45:22.338
SHOULD THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES

04:45:22.405 --> 04:45:22.638
[inaudible]

04:45:22.705 --> 04:45:24.574
HABITS.

04:45:24.640 --> 04:45:25.575
SHOULD THEY SHOULD OR SHOULD

04:45:25.641 --> 04:45:27.043
THEY NOT HAVE THEIR OWN RULES

04:45:27.109 --> 04:45:28.744
WHY SHOULD OR SHOULD NOT THE

04:45:28.811 --> 04:45:30.246
CITY OF SAN FRANCISCO THE CITY

04:45:30.313 --> 04:45:31.180
OF OAKLAND.

04:45:31.247 --> 04:45:32.548
WITH THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO OR

04:45:32.615 --> 04:45:33.716
THE CITY OF SAN DIEGO OR ANY

04:45:33.783 --> 04:45:34.684
OTHER MAJOR CITY.

04:45:34.750 --> 04:45:36.285
OR MINOR CITY.

04:45:36.352 --> 04:45:38.020
WITHIN THE STATE.

04:45:38.087 --> 04:45:39.121
SHOULD THERE IN FACT BE A

04:45:39.188 --> 04:45:41.491
PATCHWORK OF MAYBE THREE HUNDRED

04:45:41.557 --> 04:45:44.427
OR SO MAYBE FIVE THOUSAND OR SO.

04:45:44.494 --> 04:45:45.528
DIFFERENT WAYS TO BE ABLE TO

04:45:45.595 --> 04:45:46.796
GOVERN THE INTERNET THROUGHOUT

04:45:46.863 --> 04:45:48.831
THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE WE

04:45:48.898 --> 04:45:49.365
HAVEN'T MADE THE ARGUMENT

04:45:49.432 --> 04:45:50.366
PROPERLY.

04:45:50.433 --> 04:45:53.002
THAT SHOULD BE A FEDERAL LOCAL

04:45:53.069 --> 04:45:55.371
OR NATIONAL ISSUE.

04:45:55.438 --> 04:45:56.339
SO THAT I THINK REALLY IS THE

04:45:56.405 --> 04:45:57.673
FIRST QUESTION THAT WE REALLY

04:45:57.740 --> 04:45:59.509
NEED TO SOLVE IN THE DISCUSSION

04:45:59.575 --> 04:46:00.576
THAT WE HAVE HERE NOT BE

04:46:00.643 --> 04:46:02.078
LISTENING TO WHAT FOLKS HAVE TO

04:46:02.144 --> 04:46:03.145
BE ABLE TO SAY AND I'VE BEEN

04:46:03.212 --> 04:46:03.813
LISTENING TO WHAT.

04:46:03.880 --> 04:46:05.414
OUR CONSTITUENTS AND OTHERS

04:46:05.481 --> 04:46:05.915
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

04:46:05.982 --> 04:46:06.749
CALIFORNIA HAVE BEEN HAVE BEEN

04:46:06.816 --> 04:46:08.384
HAVING TO SAY BUT I'M NOT YET

04:46:08.451 --> 04:46:10.219
PERSUADED.

04:46:10.286 --> 04:46:10.853
AT THIS TIME BUT I'M WILLING TO

04:46:10.920 --> 04:46:12.755
LISTEN. TWO WHY THE STATE OF

04:46:12.822 --> 04:46:14.423
CALIFORNIA SHOULD BE THE

04:46:14.490 --> 04:46:15.791
ULTIMATE GOVERNING BODY ON THIS

04:46:15.858 --> 04:46:17.226
ISSUE.

04:46:17.293 --> 04:46:18.294
RATHER THAN LOCAL GOVERNMENTS OF

04:46:18.361 --> 04:46:20.897
THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENTS.

04:46:20.963 --> 04:46:22.131
AND THAT OF COURSE THE SECONDARY

04:46:22.198 --> 04:46:23.900
QUESTION IS.

04:46:23.966 --> 04:46:27.670
IS THIS BILL S. B..

04:46:27.737 --> 04:46:28.738
EIGHT TWENTY TWO INDEED THE BEST

04:46:28.804 --> 04:46:29.639
SOLUTION [inaudible]

04:46:29.705 --> 04:46:31.474
IF.

04:46:31.541 --> 04:46:32.942
THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA IS THE

04:46:33.009 --> 04:46:33.843
WAY TO BE ABLE TO GOVERN THIS

04:46:33.910 --> 04:46:34.544
ISSUE.

04:46:34.610 --> 04:46:35.745
SO WITH THAT I'LL BE LOOKING

04:46:35.811 --> 04:46:36.979
FORWARD TO HEARING.

04:46:37.046 --> 04:46:38.314
OF WHAT THE AUTHOR AS WELL AS

04:46:38.381 --> 04:46:39.448
OTHER MEMBERS HAVE TO SAY ABOUT

04:46:39.515 --> 04:46:41.484
THIS ISSUE.

04:46:41.551 --> 04:46:43.085
BUT LET'S BE LET'S BE VERY

04:46:43.152 --> 04:46:43.819
MEASURED IN OUR IN OUR

04:46:43.886 --> 04:46:45.321
DISCUSSION.

04:46:45.388 --> 04:46:47.490
IS THIS SIMPLY VENUE SHOPPING

04:46:47.557 --> 04:46:48.324
BECAUSE THIS IS WHERE YOU GOT

04:46:48.391 --> 04:46:50.226
THE VOTES.

04:46:50.293 --> 04:46:50.793
OR IS THIS REALLY THE RIGHT

04:46:50.860 --> 04:46:53.462
THING TO DO.

04:46:53.529 --> 04:46:55.464
THANK YOU MISTER HARPER

04:46:55.531 --> 04:46:55.765
[inaudible]

04:46:55.831 --> 04:46:59.235
MISTER OBERNOLTE.

04:46:59.302 --> 04:47:01.404
THE TOPIC OF NET NEUTRALITY IS

04:47:01.470 --> 04:47:03.205
VERY COMPLEX AND VERY TECHNICAL

04:47:03.272 --> 04:47:04.974
BUT IT'S ALSO VERY EMOTIONAL AND

04:47:05.041 --> 04:47:06.642
WILL USE EMOTIONAL WORDS WHEN WE

04:47:06.709 --> 04:47:07.577
TALK ABOUT IT.

04:47:07.643 --> 04:47:09.078
AND I'VE HAD MANY CONSTITUENTS

04:47:09.145 --> 04:47:11.080
COME TO BE AND SAY HOW CAN YOU

04:47:11.147 --> 04:47:13.849
NOT SUPPORT NET NEUTRALITY.

04:47:13.916 --> 04:47:15.451
HOW CAN YOU NOT SUPPORT A FREE

04:47:15.518 --> 04:47:17.320
AND OPEN INTERNET?

04:47:17.386 --> 04:47:19.455
AND RATHER THAN GET INTO THE

04:47:19.522 --> 04:47:21.257
TECHNICAL DETAILS WITH THEM I

04:47:21.324 --> 04:47:23.225
EXPLAIN MY OPPOSITION USING A

04:47:23.292 --> 04:47:25.061
METAPHOR IN WITH YOUR INDULGENCE

04:47:25.127 --> 04:47:26.562
I'D LIKE TO SHARE IT HERE.

04:47:26.629 --> 04:47:28.064
I TOLD THEM I IMAGINE.

04:47:28.130 --> 04:47:29.131
BUT THERE'S A VILLAGE BESIDE A

04:47:29.198 --> 04:47:30.733
RIVER.

04:47:30.800 --> 04:47:31.968
AND ONE DAY A COMPANY COMES

04:47:32.034 --> 04:47:33.569
ALONG AND BUILDS A BRIDGE OVER

04:47:33.636 --> 04:47:35.204
THE RIVER AND CHARGES CARS A

04:47:35.271 --> 04:47:37.406
TOLD ACROSS THE BRIDGE.

04:47:37.473 --> 04:47:38.641
IN THIS PRE CHEN SNOW BEING OF

04:47:38.708 --> 04:47:40.610
GREAT BENEFIT TO THE VILLAGERS

04:47:40.676 --> 04:47:42.111
IN THE VILLAGE THRIVES UNTIL

04:47:42.178 --> 04:47:43.379
MUCH OF THE COMMERCE OF THE

04:47:43.446 --> 04:47:44.614
VILLAGE INVOLVES CARS CROSSING

04:47:44.680 --> 04:47:46.349
THE BRIDGE.

04:47:46.415 --> 04:47:47.650
AND THAT LEADS TO CONGESTION ON

04:47:47.717 --> 04:47:48.818
THE BRIDGE THE BRIDGE OPERATOR

04:47:48.884 --> 04:47:50.419
ONE DAY SAYS WE'RE GOING TO

04:47:50.486 --> 04:47:51.988
INSTITUTE A DIFFERENTIAL TOLL

04:47:52.054 --> 04:47:53.956
WHERE WE CHARGE LARGE COMMERCIAL

04:47:54.023 --> 04:47:55.658
VEHICLES HIGHER TOOL THAN

04:47:55.725 --> 04:47:57.927
PASSENGER CARS.

04:47:57.994 --> 04:47:59.662
AND A GROUP OF ANGRY VILLAGERS

04:47:59.729 --> 04:48:01.764
GETS TOGETHER AND SAYS YOU CAN'T

04:48:01.831 --> 04:48:03.499
DO THAT WE DEMAND BRIDGE

04:48:03.566 --> 04:48:05.868
NEUTRALITY ALL TRAFFIC ON THE

04:48:05.935 --> 04:48:06.435
BRIDGE SHOULD BE TREATED THE

04:48:06.502 --> 04:48:08.170
SAME.

04:48:08.237 --> 04:48:09.171
AND THE BRIDGE COMPANY IS A

04:48:09.238 --> 04:48:10.406
LITTLE BAFFLED BECAUSE THEY

04:48:10.473 --> 04:48:12.108
POINT OUT THE BRIDGE IS BUILT TO

04:48:12.174 --> 04:48:13.809
SUPPORT ONLY A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF

04:48:13.876 --> 04:48:15.111
WEIGHT AND IF YOU HAVE LARGER

04:48:15.177 --> 04:48:16.479
COMMERCIAL VEHICLES CROSSING THE

04:48:16.545 --> 04:48:17.780
BRIDGE THAT MEANS FEWER

04:48:17.847 --> 04:48:19.181
PASSENGER CARS CAN BE ON THE

04:48:19.248 --> 04:48:21.417
BRIDGE AT THE SAME TIME.

04:48:21.484 --> 04:48:23.019
BUT THEY SAY OKAY HABA WE SOLVE

04:48:23.085 --> 04:48:24.220
THE PROBLEM A DIFFERENT WAY

04:48:24.286 --> 04:48:25.454
WE'RE GOING TO CONSTRUCT NEW

04:48:25.521 --> 04:48:27.023
LANES ON THE BRIDGE.

04:48:27.089 --> 04:48:28.324
THEN PEOPLE CAN PAY A HIGHER

04:48:28.391 --> 04:48:30.726
TOLL TO USE THE NEW LANES OR

04:48:30.793 --> 04:48:32.662
THEY COMPETE EXISTING TOLL TO

04:48:32.728 --> 04:48:33.295
USE THE LANES THAT ARE ALREADY

04:48:33.362 --> 04:48:34.964
THERE THAT WILL BENEFIT NOT JUST

04:48:35.031 --> 04:48:36.065
THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THE HIGHER

04:48:36.132 --> 04:48:36.866
TOLL.

04:48:36.932 --> 04:48:37.900
BUT THE PEOPLE WHO PAY THE

04:48:37.967 --> 04:48:39.835
EXISTING TOLL AS WELL SINCE

04:48:39.902 --> 04:48:41.303
THEIR LANDS WILL BE LESS CROWDED.

04:48:41.370 --> 04:48:42.605
BUT THE ANGRY VILLAGERS SAY NO

04:48:42.672 --> 04:48:44.140
YOU CAN'T DO THAT THAT'S PAID

04:48:44.206 --> 04:48:45.074
PRIORITIZATION THAT SHOULD BE

04:48:45.141 --> 04:48:47.276
ILLEGAL.

04:48:47.343 --> 04:48:48.744
SO BRIDGE COMPANY SAYS OR CAMP

04:48:48.811 --> 04:48:49.512
OUT THIS WILL COME UP WITH A

04:48:49.578 --> 04:48:51.213
PASS.

04:48:51.280 --> 04:48:52.982
AND IF YOU HAVE A PASS THEN YOU

04:48:53.049 --> 04:48:54.483
DON'T HAVE TO PAY A TOLL AT ALL.

04:48:54.550 --> 04:48:56.118
AN ANGRY VILLAGERS SAY ONCE

04:48:56.185 --> 04:48:58.254
AGAIN THAT IS ZERO RATING YOU

04:48:58.320 --> 04:48:59.588
CAN'T DO THAT WE'RE GONNA MAKE

04:48:59.655 --> 04:49:01.323
THAT ILLEGAL.

04:49:01.390 --> 04:49:02.525
TO IF YOU ASK THE ANGRY

04:49:02.591 --> 04:49:04.160
VILLAGERS WHY ARE YOU SO ANGRY

04:49:04.226 --> 04:49:06.162
HERE'S WHAT THEY'LL SAY.

04:49:06.228 --> 04:49:08.030
THEY'LL SAY YOU DON'T REALIZE

04:49:08.097 --> 04:49:09.398
HOW MUCH CONTROL THE BRIDGE

04:49:09.465 --> 04:49:11.434
COMPANY HAS OVER THE VILLAGE WHY

04:49:11.500 --> 04:49:13.035
IF THE BRIDGE COMPANY WANTED.

04:49:13.102 --> 04:49:14.904
TO THEY COULD PREVENT CARS FROM

04:49:14.970 --> 04:49:15.838
CROSSING THE BRIDGE AT ALL THEY

04:49:15.905 --> 04:49:17.273
COULD PREVENT TRUCKS FROM A

04:49:17.339 --> 04:49:17.873
CERTAIN COMPANY FROM CROSSING

04:49:17.940 --> 04:49:19.909
THE BRIDGE.

04:49:19.975 --> 04:49:21.377
BUT HERE'S THE CRUX OF THE STORY

04:49:21.444 --> 04:49:23.746
ALL THAT YOU NEED. TO DO TO

04:49:23.813 --> 04:49:25.414
PREVENT THAT FROM OCCURRING TO

04:49:25.481 --> 04:49:26.649
BREAK THE POWER OF THE BRIDGE

04:49:26.716 --> 04:49:27.850
COMPANY OVER THE VILLAGE IS MORE

04:49:27.917 --> 04:49:29.318
BRIDGES.

04:49:29.385 --> 04:49:30.786
ALL YOU NEED IS LOTS A BRIDGES

04:49:30.853 --> 04:49:32.288
CROSSING THE RIVER AT DIFFERENT

04:49:32.354 --> 04:49:33.422
POINTS AND THEN THE VILLAGERS

04:49:33.489 --> 04:49:34.757
CAN DECIDE WHICH BRIDGE THEY

04:49:34.824 --> 04:49:36.125
WANT TO USE AND NO BRIDGE

04:49:36.192 --> 04:49:37.259
COMPANY CAN TAKE UNFAIR

04:49:37.326 --> 04:49:39.228
ADVANTAGE AND YOU GET SOMETHING

04:49:39.295 --> 04:49:40.596
THAT YOU CAN'T GET ANY OTHER WAY

04:49:40.663 --> 04:49:41.630
WHICH IS FAIR PRICING.

04:49:41.697 --> 04:49:43.999
ON THE TOLLS [inaudible]

04:49:44.066 --> 04:49:46.836
UNFORTUNATELY THIS BILL ENACTS

04:49:46.902 --> 04:49:48.671
THE HARSHEST REGULATION ON

04:49:48.738 --> 04:49:50.072
INTERNET OF ANY STATE IN THE

04:49:50.139 --> 04:49:51.607
COUNTRY.

04:49:51.674 --> 04:49:53.142
AND WHEN YOU DO THAT WE'VE SEEN

04:49:53.209 --> 04:49:54.643
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT

04:49:54.710 --> 04:49:55.644
YOU DON'T GET MORE BRIDGES YOU

04:49:55.711 --> 04:49:58.114
GET FEWER BRIDGES.

04:49:58.180 --> 04:49:59.348
I WANNA TAKE JUST A MOMENT AND

04:49:59.415 --> 04:50:00.683
TALK ABOUT BUT ESPECIALLY

04:50:00.750 --> 04:50:02.651
PERNICIOUS COMPONENT OF THIS

04:50:02.718 --> 04:50:03.686
BILL AND THAT IS THE BAN ON ZERO

04:50:03.753 --> 04:50:04.887
RATING.

04:50:04.954 --> 04:50:07.323
AND THAT BAND GOES WELL BEYOND

04:50:07.389 --> 04:50:09.058
WHAT WAS IN THE TWO THOUSAND

04:50:09.125 --> 04:50:09.925
FIFTEEN FCC REGULATIONS ON NET

04:50:09.992 --> 04:50:12.695
NEUTRALITY. ZERO RATING IF

04:50:12.762 --> 04:50:13.262
YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH THE

04:50:13.329 --> 04:50:14.230
LINGO.

04:50:14.296 --> 04:50:16.065
IS THE PRACTICE WHERE A COMPANY

04:50:16.132 --> 04:50:18.200
PAYS INTERNET PROVIDER DO NOT

04:50:18.267 --> 04:50:19.735
HAVE DATA INVOLVED WITH A

04:50:19.802 --> 04:50:21.971
COMPANY COUNT TOWARDS CUSTOMERS

04:50:22.037 --> 04:50:23.739
DATA PLAN SO FOR EXAMPLE.

04:50:23.806 --> 04:50:26.575
IF YOU USE OUR NETFLIX TO WATCH.

04:50:26.642 --> 04:50:28.544
NETFLIX ON YOUR A MOVIE ON YOUR

04:50:28.611 --> 04:50:29.411
CELL PHONE.

04:50:29.478 --> 04:50:31.781
AND YOU PROBABLY WILL NOT PAY I

04:50:31.847 --> 04:50:33.382
HAVE THAT DATA COUNT TOWARDS

04:50:33.449 --> 04:50:35.050
YOUR DATA CARE.

04:50:35.117 --> 04:50:37.920
WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT.

04:50:37.987 --> 04:50:39.688
IF WE DO AWAY WITH OUT FOR MOST

04:50:39.755 --> 04:50:41.290
OF US THE VALUE OF THAT DATA IS

04:50:41.357 --> 04:50:42.792
ONLY A FEW DOLLARS A MONTH BUT

04:50:42.858 --> 04:50:44.493
THAT IS NOT TRUE.

04:50:44.560 --> 04:50:45.828
OF THE MOST DISADVANTAGED

04:50:45.895 --> 04:50:47.830
MEMBERS OF OUR SOCIETY THE DATA

04:50:47.897 --> 04:50:49.532
SHOWS THAT MANY OF THAT

04:50:49.598 --> 04:50:51.734
POPULATION CAN'T AFFORD MULTIPLE

04:50:51.801 --> 04:50:53.402
ACCESS POINTS OF THE INTERNET SO

04:50:53.469 --> 04:50:54.703
THEY USE ONLY THEIR MOBILE PHONE

04:50:54.770 --> 04:50:56.138
TO ACCESS THE INTERNET.

04:50:56.205 --> 04:50:57.840
AND THAT IT ALSO SHOWS THAT THE

04:50:57.907 --> 04:50:59.341
IMPACT TO THAT SEGMENT OF THE

04:50:59.408 --> 04:51:00.409
POPULATION IS MUCH MORE

04:51:00.476 --> 04:51:01.777
DEVASTATING HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS

04:51:01.844 --> 04:51:03.179
A YEAR.

04:51:03.245 --> 04:51:04.480
AND BECAUSE MOST OF THOSE PEOPLE

04:51:04.547 --> 04:51:05.614
CAN'T AFFORD IT THEY'RE GONNA

04:51:05.681 --> 04:51:07.249
HAVE TO PICK BETWEEN PAYING

04:51:07.316 --> 04:51:08.284
HUNDREDS OF DOLLARS IN HERE OR

04:51:08.350 --> 04:51:09.819
NOT WATCHING NETFLIX AT ALL OR

04:51:09.885 --> 04:51:11.854
NOT USING THOSE OTHER SERVICES.

04:51:11.921 --> 04:51:13.289
WHY WOULD YOU TAKE THAT AWAY

04:51:13.355 --> 04:51:15.124
FROM THEM?

04:51:15.191 --> 04:51:16.292
WHY ON EARTH WOULD YOU TAKE THAT

04:51:16.358 --> 04:51:18.160
AWAY FROM THEM?

04:51:18.227 --> 04:51:20.896
THIS BILL IS BAD FOR THE POOR.

04:51:20.963 --> 04:51:22.598
IT'S BAD FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS IN

04:51:22.665 --> 04:51:23.566
CALIFORNIA'S BET FOR CALIFORNIA

04:51:23.632 --> 04:51:25.100
CONSUMERS.

04:51:25.167 --> 04:51:26.101
IT'S BAD FOR CALIFORNIA I URGE A

04:51:26.168 --> 04:51:29.405
NO VOTE.

04:51:29.471 --> 04:51:30.706

04:51:45.921 --> 04:51:46.322
FUTURE INTERCONNECTION

04:51:46.388 --> 04:51:48.090
AGREEMENTS.

THANK YOU SPEAKER.

04:52:02.972 --> 04:52:06.108

04:52:06.175 --> 04:52:08.444
THE OBAMA ORDER.

04:52:08.510 --> 04:52:10.512
NO WITH THE OBAMA ORDER SAN

04:52:10.579 --> 04:52:13.182
ABOUT INTERCONNECTION FEES IS

04:52:13.249 --> 04:52:14.750
THERE WASN'T GOING TO BE ONE

04:52:14.817 --> 04:52:16.452
REGULATION.

04:52:16.518 --> 04:52:19.054
ON THE INTERCONNECTION FEES

04:52:19.121 --> 04:52:21.023
INSTEAD IT WOULD LOOK AT THE

04:52:21.090 --> 04:52:23.525
ISSUE ON A CASE BY CASE BASIS.

04:52:23.592 --> 04:52:25.461
THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT IS BEING

04:52:25.527 --> 04:52:27.463
DONE HERE.

04:52:27.529 --> 04:52:29.164
SO ONE CAN IMAGINE [inaudible]

04:52:29.231 --> 04:52:30.766
FOR EXAMPLE.

04:52:30.833 --> 04:52:32.501
YOU HAVE THE INTERNET SERVICE

04:52:32.568 --> 04:52:33.702
PROVIDER THAT'S DOING THE LAST

04:52:33.769 --> 04:52:35.537
MILE.

04:52:35.604 --> 04:52:37.506
YOU HAVE A MIDDLE MODEL PROVIDER

04:52:37.573 --> 04:52:38.440

THE INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER.

04:52:52.221 --> 04:52:54.523
CHARGE THAT MIDDLE MINOR MIDDLE

04:52:54.590 --> 04:52:57.793
MILE PROVIDER. TO ME AT LEAST.

04:52:57.860 --> 04:53:00.296
THAT WOULD SEEM.

04:53:00.362 --> 04:53:01.797
TO BE A VERY DANGEROUS THING

04:53:01.864 --> 04:53:02.665
BECAUSE IT COULD SLOW DOWN THE

04:53:02.731 --> 04:53:03.766
INTERNET.

04:53:03.832 --> 04:53:06.101
ON THE OTHER HAND [inaudible]

04:53:06.168 --> 04:53:08.404
IF NETFLIX.

04:53:08.470 --> 04:53:09.505
WHERE TO DO SOME SORT OF

04:53:09.571 --> 04:53:11.674
DRAMATIC NETWORK OF ITS OWN AND

04:53:11.740 --> 04:53:14.076
THAT NEED A SPECIAL PIPE

04:53:14.143 --> 04:53:14.376
[inaudible]

04:53:14.443 --> 04:53:17.112
CONNECT TO THE INTERNET SERVICE

04:53:17.179 --> 04:53:18.747
PROVIDER AND THEN INTERNET

04:53:18.814 --> 04:53:20.816
SERVICE PROVIDER HAD TO BUILD A

04:53:20.883 --> 04:53:22.217
SPECIAL PIE.

04:53:22.284 --> 04:53:24.019
THEN IN THAT CASE I BELIEVE YOU

04:53:24.086 --> 04:53:26.422
COULD CHARGE.

04:53:26.488 --> 04:53:29.224
THAT ALL WOULD BE DETERMINED BY

04:53:29.291 --> 04:53:30.726
THE ATTORNEY GENERAL WHO'S IN

04:53:30.793 --> 04:53:32.728
CHARGE OF ENFORCEMENT SAID THIS

04:53:32.795 --> 04:53:35.230
BILL DOES HAVE FLEXIBILITY.

04:53:35.297 --> 04:53:38.701
DOES ALLOW FOR SOME CHARGES WHEN

04:53:38.767 --> 04:53:46.008

OF ON WHAT REALLY IS I THINK

04:53:56.785 --> 04:53:57.353
IT'S GOING TO BE AT THE HEART OF

04:53:57.419 --> 04:53:58.821
THIS.

04:53:58.887 --> 04:54:01.123
WHICH IS OUR THIS [inaudible]

04:54:01.190 --> 04:54:03.125
IT'S CLEARLY.

04:54:03.192 --> 04:54:05.361
A FEDERAL ISSUE.

04:54:05.427 --> 04:54:07.963
A JURISDICTION WHERE PREEMPTION

04:54:08.030 --> 04:54:09.832
IS GOING TO BE.

04:54:09.898 --> 04:54:12.134
A BIT THE DISCUSSION AND IT'S

04:54:12.201 --> 04:54:13.802
GOING TO END UP BEING.

04:54:13.869 --> 04:54:17.106
NOT LITIGATED IF THERE WAS EVER

04:54:17.172 --> 04:54:18.774
ANYTHING AS UBIQUITOUS AND

04:54:18.841 --> 04:54:21.210
INTERSTATE COMMERCE.

04:54:21.276 --> 04:54:22.544
AS THE INTERNET I CAN'T THINK OF

04:54:22.611 --> 04:54:24.246
ANYTHING.

04:54:24.313 --> 04:54:26.148
A GROUP MORE DIRECTED WITH

04:54:26.215 --> 04:54:28.017
RESPECT TO THAT EXAMPLE.

04:54:28.083 --> 04:54:30.886
THIS WILL IN FACT BE LITIGATED

04:54:30.953 --> 04:54:33.522
AND IT WILL BE LITIGATED UP.

04:54:33.589 --> 04:54:35.391
PRESUMABLY TO THE SUPREME COURT.

04:54:35.457 --> 04:54:37.426
AND Y. BECAUSE IT TRAMPLES

04:54:37.493 --> 04:54:39.328
FUNDAMENTALLY.

04:54:39.395 --> 04:54:41.697
ON THE KINDS OF SEPARATED POWERS

04:54:41.764 --> 04:54:44.233
AND ENUMERATED POWERS AND POWERS

04:54:44.299 --> 04:54:46.368
THAT HAVE BEEN THROUGH A COURTS

04:54:46.435 --> 04:54:48.337
AND AND AND JURISDICTIONS AND

04:54:48.404 --> 04:54:50.372
AND RULE MAKING.

04:54:50.439 --> 04:54:52.141
THE FACT IS THAT THE WORST

04:54:52.207 --> 04:54:53.776
POSSIBLE THING.

04:54:53.842 --> 04:54:54.610
THAT WE COULD DO [inaudible]

04:54:54.676 --> 04:54:58.347
IT'S BUT I HAVE CREATED

04:54:58.414 --> 04:55:00.215
[inaudible] FIFTY DIFFERENT

04:55:00.282 --> 04:55:00.749
STATE [inaudible]

04:55:00.816 --> 04:55:03.452
FCC'S.

04:55:03.519 --> 04:55:05.487
SO FIRST OF ALL.

04:55:05.554 --> 04:55:07.856
WHAT IS AN EFFORT HERE I THINK A?

04:55:07.923 --> 04:55:09.691
SO WHAT POLITICAL.

04:55:09.758 --> 04:55:11.126
AND I THINK DUBBED QUITE SHORT

04:55:11.193 --> 04:55:13.095
SIGHTED.

04:55:13.162 --> 04:55:15.964
WILL TRIP LITIGATION THAT I

04:55:16.031 --> 04:55:17.466
THINK THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA

04:55:17.533 --> 04:55:18.634
WILL BE.

04:55:18.700 --> 04:55:20.069
UNSUCCESSFUL [inaudible]

04:55:20.135 --> 04:55:21.970
IN DEFENDING.

04:55:22.037 --> 04:55:24.306
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN IT MEANS

04:55:24.373 --> 04:55:25.474
UNCERTAINTY?

04:55:25.541 --> 04:55:27.509
IN CALIFORNIA FOR AS LONG AS THE

04:55:27.576 --> 04:55:28.944
LITIGATION.

04:55:29.011 --> 04:55:31.480
PROCEEDS IT COULD VERY THEM

04:55:31.547 --> 04:55:33.415
HIGHLY PROBABLY.

04:55:33.482 --> 04:55:35.184
LEAD TO THE UP SUPREME COURT

04:55:35.250 --> 04:55:36.385
ESSENTIALLY SAYING THAT IT

04:55:36.452 --> 04:55:38.554
CALIFORNIA THIS IS AN AREA THAT

04:55:38.620 --> 04:55:39.888
IS RESERVED. FOR THE FEDERAL

04:55:39.955 --> 04:55:41.523
GOVERNMENT.

04:55:41.590 --> 04:55:43.659
SO I THINK THE BIGGER POINT HERE

04:55:43.725 --> 04:55:47.162
IS IF YOU ARE REALLY INTERESTED.

04:55:47.229 --> 04:55:49.164
I IN THAT NEUTRALITY UP THE

04:55:49.231 --> 04:55:51.133
PLACE TO HAVE THIS --

04:55:51.200 --> 04:55:53.168
FLASHED OUT IS AT THE FEDERAL

04:55:53.235 --> 04:55:54.770
LEVEL WITH FEDERAL ELECTIONS IN

04:55:54.837 --> 04:55:56.772
FEDERAL ACCOUNTABILITY.

04:55:56.839 --> 04:55:58.774
WE ARE GOING TO I THINK IN MANY

04:55:58.841 --> 04:56:00.442
RESPECTS CHILL.

ARE THE INTERNET IN CALIFORNIA.

04:56:02.744 --> 04:56:04.580
BECAUSE ABOUT LITIGATION AND THE

04:56:04.646 --> 04:56:06.615
UNCERTAINTY THAT IT CREATES.

04:56:06.682 --> 04:56:08.784
AND I KNOW THERE MAY BE SOME

04:56:08.851 --> 04:56:09.718
MEMBERS ARE GOING TO SUGGEST

04:56:09.785 --> 04:56:10.018
THAT -- WELL

04:56:10.085 --> 04:56:11.720
HOW CAN YOU.

04:56:11.787 --> 04:56:12.988
PRESUME WHAT A COURTS GOING TO

04:56:13.055 --> 04:56:14.556
DO IN THE UNCERTAIN IT'S AFTER.

04:56:14.623 --> 04:56:16.725
I'M ALL I CAN TELL YOU IS NOT

04:56:26.568 --> 04:56:28.837
BEEN LIKE.

04:56:28.904 --> 04:56:31.106
IF I WHAT WERE REGULATED BY

04:56:31.173 --> 04:56:32.741
EVERY --

04:56:32.808 --> 04:56:34.376
THAT LOOKED OUT.

04:56:34.443 --> 04:56:36.612
WANNABE FCC THAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO

04:56:36.678 --> 04:56:37.212
BE IN THE JURISDICTION WHERE I

04:56:37.279 --> 04:56:38.747

04:56:38.814 --> 04:56:41.583
REPEATEDLY AN AND OVER AGAIN.

04:56:41.650 --> 04:56:42.784
THE FACT OF THE MATTER IS WHEN

04:56:42.851 --> 04:56:45.020
THIS HAS BEEN TESTED.

04:56:45.087 --> 04:56:46.755
WHEN STE THE STATE'S OUR

04:56:46.822 --> 04:56:48.524
COMMUNITIES HAVE TRIED TO SAY TO

04:56:48.590 --> 04:56:51.260
A FEDERALLY REGULATED DUBBED?

04:56:51.326 --> 04:56:54.062

04:56:58.600 --> 04:56:59.535
AND IT'S BEEN THE INTERSTATE

04:56:59.601 --> 04:57:01.336
COMMERCE CLAUSE AND ITS

04:57:01.403 --> 04:57:02.037
APPLICATION BATS.

04:57:02.104 --> 04:57:04.940
THAT'S COMING OUR WAY.

04:57:05.007 --> 04:57:05.974
I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT ALSO

04:57:06.041 --> 04:57:07.409
UNDER DISPUTE THE FACT THAT THIS

04:57:07.476 --> 04:57:09.311
IS JUST THAT THE OBAMA AIRONET

04:57:09.378 --> 04:57:10.412
NEUTRALITY.

04:57:10.479 --> 04:57:12.581
AND WE HAD A A VOTE ON THAT BILL

04:57:12.648 --> 04:57:13.482
IN.

04:57:13.549 --> 04:57:14.716
THE COMMITTEE THAT WAS PRECISELY

04:57:14.783 --> 04:57:16.985
THAT.

04:57:17.052 --> 04:57:18.787
AND FOR SOME REASON OF THAT

04:57:18.854 --> 04:57:20.422
DIDN'T COUNT THAT DID MATTER NOW

04:57:20.489 --> 04:57:21.623
WE'RE LOADING UP.

04:57:21.690 --> 04:57:23.392
A VERY SIGNIFICANT.

04:57:23.458 --> 04:57:25.360
A SET OF ADDITIONS.

04:57:25.427 --> 04:57:27.529
OF REGULATIONS AND AND HOOPS AND

04:57:27.596 --> 04:57:29.431
THANKS TO JUMP THROUGH.

04:57:29.498 --> 04:57:30.365
IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO

04:57:30.432 --> 04:57:33.835
JUST TO CLAIM THAT THIS IS.

04:57:33.902 --> 04:57:36.371
OUR ONLY OBAMA ERA I THINK IS

04:57:36.438 --> 04:57:39.007
EXHIBITED HUGE EXAGGERATION.

04:57:39.074 --> 04:57:41.176
HAD IT BEN.

04:57:41.243 --> 04:57:44.313
THE OBAMACARE REGULATIONS.

04:57:44.379 --> 04:57:45.314
I WOULD HAVE BEEN GLADLY

04:57:45.380 --> 04:57:47.349
STANDING HERE.

04:57:47.416 --> 04:57:49.117
ASKING FOR YOU TO SUPPORT IT.

04:57:49.184 --> 04:57:50.552
BUT I CANNOT BECAUSE IT TAKES

04:57:50.619 --> 04:57:51.987
SEVERAL STEPS.

04:57:52.054 --> 04:57:54.156
WAY TOO FAR.

04:57:54.223 --> 04:57:55.657
IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOTE SOMETHING

04:57:55.724 --> 04:57:58.627
THAT THERE WAS A PERIOD OF TIME.

04:57:58.694 --> 04:58:00.395
BETWEEN TWO THOUSAND AND NINE

04:58:00.462 --> 04:58:01.697
AND TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN

04:58:01.763 --> 04:58:04.366
WHEN AND THE AND THE FACT IS

04:58:04.433 --> 04:58:06.201
THAT THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT.

04:58:06.268 --> 04:58:08.203
ARE -- EACH

04:58:08.270 --> 04:58:09.004
YEAR.

04:58:09.071 --> 04:58:10.772
ARE FROM ARE THE END OF THE

04:58:10.839 --> 04:58:12.507
RECESSION UNTIL TWENTY FOURTEEN

04:58:12.574 --> 04:58:14.876
WAS VERY ROBUST VERY STRONG.

04:58:14.943 --> 04:58:17.779
AND THE FACT IS THAT WHEN TO

04:58:17.846 --> 04:58:19.414
FIFTEEN ARRIVED AND THE LIGHT

04:58:19.481 --> 04:58:20.882
TOUCH ON THE INTERNET WAS

04:58:20.949 --> 04:58:23.151
REPLACED BY THE HEAVY TOUCH.

04:58:23.218 --> 04:58:24.686
THURMOND AND YET INTERNET

04:58:24.753 --> 04:58:26.555
CAPITAL INVESTMENT BROADBAND

04:58:26.622 --> 04:58:28.657
PROVIDERS DECLINE FOR THE FIRST

04:58:28.724 --> 04:58:30.058
TIME SINCE THE END.

04:58:30.125 --> 04:58:31.393
OF THE RECESSION AND INVESTMENT

04:58:31.460 --> 04:58:35.364
LOW STEAM DOWN MORE THAN THREE

04:58:35.430 --> 04:58:37.332
OR 4% FROM TWENTY FOUR TO LOOK.

04:58:37.399 --> 04:58:40.002
THE BAD THE BOTTOM LINE HERE IS.

04:58:40.068 --> 04:58:41.503
THAT THE LIGHT TOUCH INTERNET

04:58:41.570 --> 04:58:43.472
HAS EXPLODED AND THE FLOURISHED

04:58:43.538 --> 04:58:45.674
AND HAS HUGE COMPETITION AND

04:58:45.741 --> 04:58:47.909
GREAT BENEFIT FOR PEOPLE ACROSS

04:58:47.976 --> 04:58:48.410
THE UNITED STATES AND IN

04:58:48.477 --> 04:58:50.112
CALIFORNIA.

04:58:50.178 --> 04:58:52.481
THE OVER REACH THE GOING TOO FAR

04:58:52.547 --> 04:58:54.449
HERE IS GOING TO BE CHALLENGED

04:58:54.516 --> 04:58:56.218
IN COURT CONSTITUTIONALLY THAT

04:58:56.285 --> 04:58:57.719
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OURSELVES IN

04:58:57.786 --> 04:58:59.354
VERY UNCERTAIN TERRITORY.

04:58:59.421 --> 04:59:00.522
WITH AN UNCERTAINTY AND A

04:59:00.589 --> 04:59:01.523
CHILLING.

04:59:01.590 --> 04:59:03.292
OFF THE INTERNET.

04:59:03.358 --> 04:59:05.327
WHAT HAS BEEN SO SUCCESSFUL SO

04:59:05.394 --> 04:59:07.229
UBIQUITOUS AND SO IMPORTANT

04:59:07.296 --> 04:59:09.031
CALIFORNIA?

04:59:09.097 --> 04:59:11.400
I THINK IT'S GOING TO BE A

04:59:11.466 --> 04:59:12.668
FRAUGHT WITH LITIGATION

04:59:12.734 --> 04:59:14.770
UNCERTAINTY AND THAT'S GOING TO

04:59:14.836 --> 04:59:16.571
MEAN THAT OUR CONSTITUENTS ARE

04:59:16.638 --> 04:59:18.707
GOING TO HAVE AN INTERNET THAT

04:59:18.774 --> 04:59:20.575
IS GLASS.

04:59:20.642 --> 04:59:23.111
I ROBUST LESS INVESTED IN THEM

04:59:23.178 --> 04:59:25.213
THAN WE'VE HAD BEFORE THAT'S

04:59:25.280 --> 04:59:27.049
WHAT HEAVY REGULATION DOES.

04:59:27.115 --> 04:59:28.817
TIMELY MIGHT REGULATION IS THE

04:59:28.884 --> 04:59:30.619
ANSWER BAD AND I'M GOING TO ASK

04:59:30.686 --> 04:59:31.653
THAT THAT YOU VOTE NO

04:59:31.720 --> 04:59:31.953
[inaudible]

04:59:32.020 --> 04:59:35.657
YOUR KILEY.

04:59:35.724 --> 04:59:38.260
THANK YOU SPEAKER.

04:59:38.327 --> 04:59:40.429
CLEAR THAT THERE IS OVERWHELMING

04:59:40.495 --> 04:59:42.698
SUPPORT IN THIS BODY AND

04:59:42.764 --> 04:59:43.598
THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF

04:59:43.665 --> 04:59:44.633
CALIFORNIA FOR THE PRINCIPLES OF

04:59:44.700 --> 04:59:46.535
NET NEUTRALITY.

04:59:46.601 --> 04:59:48.270
THAT CONTENT ON THE INTERNET

04:59:48.337 --> 04:59:49.771
SHOULD BE NEITHER WALKED NORTH

04:59:49.838 --> 04:59:51.606
THROTTLED NOR TREATED IN A

04:59:51.673 --> 04:59:53.942
DISCRIMINATORY MANNER.

04:59:54.009 --> 04:59:55.644
BUT SUPPORTING THOSE PRINCIPLES

04:59:55.711 --> 04:59:57.679
DOES NOT MEAN SUPPORTING THIS

04:59:57.746 --> 04:59:59.181
PARTICULAR BILL.

04:59:59.247 --> 05:00:00.982
I DO NOT BELIEVE.

05:00:01.049 --> 05:00:03.151
THAT PASSING THIS BILL WILL

05:00:03.218 --> 05:00:04.286
RESULT IN NET NEUTRALITY IN

05:00:04.353 --> 05:00:06.054
CALIFORNIA.

05:00:06.121 --> 05:00:09.157
AND THEIR TWO MAIN REASONS WHY.

05:00:09.224 --> 05:00:10.692
THE FIRST REASON IS THAT WHEN

05:00:10.759 --> 05:00:11.960
LOOKING AT THE BEST DEFINITION

05:00:12.027 --> 05:00:13.462
OF NET NEUTRALITY THAT WE HAVE

05:00:13.528 --> 05:00:14.796
THE F. C. C.'S TWO THOUSAND

05:00:14.863 --> 05:00:16.465
FIFTEEN ORDER.

05:00:16.531 --> 05:00:17.666
THIS BILL DIVERGES FROM IT DOES

05:00:17.733 --> 05:00:19.234
NOT.

05:00:19.301 --> 05:00:21.370
RE ENACT THAT ORDER THIS WAS

05:00:21.436 --> 05:00:23.071
PROPOSED BY THE ASSEMBLY PRIVACY

05:00:23.138 --> 05:00:24.673
COMMITTEE.

05:00:24.740 --> 05:00:25.240
BUT THE BILL WENT IN ANOTHER

05:00:25.307 --> 05:00:26.842
DIRECTION.

05:00:26.908 --> 05:00:28.877
IMPOSING NEW UNPRECEDENTED

05:00:28.944 --> 05:00:30.178
RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERNET

05:00:30.245 --> 05:00:31.513
THAT WERE NOT PART OF NET

05:00:31.580 --> 05:00:34.116
NEUTRALITY AS THE OBAMA ERA FCC.

05:00:34.182 --> 05:00:36.385
UNDERSTOOD IT.

05:00:36.451 --> 05:00:37.018
BUT YOU KNOW IF YOU TAKE MY WORD

05:00:37.085 --> 05:00:38.186
FOR THAT.

05:00:38.253 --> 05:00:39.721
IN COMMITTEE WE HEARD FROM THE

05:00:39.788 --> 05:00:41.022
ARCHITECT OF THIS BILL THE

05:00:41.089 --> 05:00:42.824
PROFESSOR WHO ALSO HAD A HAND IN

05:00:42.891 --> 05:00:44.559
THE FCC ORDER.

05:00:44.626 --> 05:00:46.094
AND SHE EXPLAINED TO US OUR

05:00:46.161 --> 05:00:47.963
VARIOUS POLICIES THAT ARE IN

05:00:48.029 --> 05:00:49.798
THIS BILL THAT WERE PROPOSED TO

05:00:49.865 --> 05:00:52.601
THE FCC BUT WERE NOT INCLUDED IN

05:00:52.667 --> 05:00:54.536
THE FCC'S ORDER AS PART OF NET

05:00:54.603 --> 05:00:56.571
NEUTRALITY.

05:00:56.638 --> 05:00:58.774
AND THESE NEW UNPRECEDENTED

05:00:58.840 --> 05:01:00.108
RESTRICTIONS ON THE INTERNET

05:01:00.175 --> 05:01:01.810
PROVISIONS DEALING WITH NETWORK

05:01:01.877 --> 05:01:03.145
MANAGEMENT ZERO RATING

05:01:03.211 --> 05:01:03.879
INTERCONNECTION SPECIALIZED

05:01:03.945 --> 05:01:05.380
SERVICES.

05:01:05.447 --> 05:01:07.616
NOT ONLY ARE EXTRANEOUS TO NET

05:01:07.682 --> 05:01:09.317
NEUTRALITY BUT ACTIVELY WORK

05:01:09.384 --> 05:01:11.686
AGAINST ITS GOAL OF A FREE AND

05:01:11.753 --> 05:01:13.321
OPEN INTERNET FOR ALL.

05:01:13.388 --> 05:01:15.090
BY RAISING COSTS PARTICULARLY

05:01:15.157 --> 05:01:16.792
BURDENING THE POOR BY REDUCING

05:01:16.858 --> 05:01:19.494
ACT REDUCING ACCESS ESPECIALLY

05:01:19.561 --> 05:01:21.463
FOR RURAL AREAS BY LIMITING

05:01:21.530 --> 05:01:23.265
CHOICES BY THROTTLING THE

05:01:23.331 --> 05:01:25.133
BREATHTAKING INNOVATION THAT HAS

05:01:25.200 --> 05:01:26.668
BEEN A HALLMARK.

05:01:26.735 --> 05:01:29.638
OF THE INFORMATION AGE.

05:01:29.704 --> 05:01:31.173
BUT THE SECOND REASON THAT THIS

05:01:31.239 --> 05:01:32.441
BILL WILL NOT RESULT IN NET

05:01:32.507 --> 05:01:34.876
NEUTRALITY IN CALIFORNIA IS THAT

05:01:34.943 --> 05:01:36.878
IT IS PREEMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW

05:01:36.945 --> 05:01:38.713
NOW THIS TERM FEDERAL PREEMPTION

05:01:38.780 --> 05:01:40.182
I KNOW IT SOUNDS LEGALISTIC.

05:01:40.248 --> 05:01:42.017
BUT IT'S AT THE HEART OF

05:01:42.083 --> 05:01:43.685
AMERICAN FRIENDLY FEDERALISM.

05:01:43.752 --> 05:01:45.187
JUST AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT

05:01:45.253 --> 05:01:47.456
CANNOT INFRINGE UPON OUR SPEAR

05:01:47.522 --> 05:01:50.025
OF LAWMAKING AS A STATE SO TO WE

05:01:50.091 --> 05:01:51.026
AS A STATE.

05:01:51.092 --> 05:01:52.594
CANNOT LEGISLATE IN A WAY THAT

05:01:52.661 --> 05:01:55.564
CONFLICTS FEDERAL LAW AND HERE

05:01:55.630 --> 05:01:56.465
THE PREEMPTION CASE IS REALLY

05:01:56.531 --> 05:01:58.233
CLEAR.

05:01:58.300 --> 05:02:00.702
THE RELEVANT FEDERAL LAW THE TWO

05:02:00.769 --> 05:02:01.670
THOUSAND SEVENTEEN FCC ORDER

05:02:01.736 --> 05:02:03.138
THAT'S THE ONE NET NEUTRALITY

05:02:03.205 --> 05:02:04.606
SUPPORTERS DON'T LIKE.

05:02:04.673 --> 05:02:09.110
HAS A PROVISION IN PARAGRAPH.

05:02:09.177 --> 05:02:09.711
ONE NINETY FOUR THAT EXPRESSLY

05:02:09.778 --> 05:02:11.580
PREAMPS STATE AND LOCAL LAW

05:02:11.646 --> 05:02:13.181
MAKING ON THE MATTER.

05:02:13.248 --> 05:02:14.282
BUT YOU MIGHT SAY WAIT A MINUTE

05:02:14.349 --> 05:02:16.151
IS NOT TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN

05:02:16.218 --> 05:02:17.886
FCC ORDER ITSELF BEING

05:02:17.953 --> 05:02:19.788
CHALLENGED IN COURT RIGHT NOW.

05:02:19.855 --> 05:02:21.756
AND THAT'S TRUE IT IS.

05:02:21.823 --> 05:02:23.859
BUT EVEN OF THAT ORDER.

05:02:23.925 --> 05:02:25.594
WERE SOMEHOW INVALIDATED THERE

05:02:25.660 --> 05:02:27.229
STILL A PROBLEM AND THAT'S OF

05:02:27.295 --> 05:02:29.130
THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN FCC

05:02:29.197 --> 05:02:30.799
ORDER THE ONE THAT NET

05:02:30.866 --> 05:02:32.334
NEUTRALITY SUPPORTERS LIKE.

05:02:32.400 --> 05:02:34.202
ALSO PREEMPTED STATE AND LOCAL

05:02:34.269 --> 05:02:35.403
LAW MAKING WITH PERMISSION TO

05:02:35.470 --> 05:02:38.640
READ MISTER SPEAKER [inaudible]

05:02:38.707 --> 05:02:40.208
WITHOUT OBJECTION.

05:02:40.275 --> 05:02:41.943
PARAGRAPH FOUR THIRTY THREE OF

05:02:42.010 --> 05:02:42.911
THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN ORDER

05:02:42.978 --> 05:02:43.745
STATES THE COMMISSION IS USE

05:02:43.812 --> 05:02:45.514
PREEMPTION TO PROTECT FEDERAL

05:02:45.580 --> 05:02:47.048
INTEREST WHEN A STATE REGULATION

05:02:47.115 --> 05:02:47.949
CONFLICTS WITH FEDERAL RULES OR

05:02:48.016 --> 05:02:50.085
POLICIES.

05:02:50.151 --> 05:02:51.286
AND WE INTEND TO EXERCISE THIS

05:02:51.353 --> 05:02:53.188
AUTHORITY TO PREEMPT ANY STATE

05:02:53.255 --> 05:02:54.823
REGULATIONS OF A CONFLICT WHICH

05:02:54.890 --> 05:02:56.558
CONFLICT WITH THIS COMPREHENSIVE

05:02:56.625 --> 05:02:58.093
REGULATORY SCHEME.

05:02:58.159 --> 05:02:59.227
OR OTHER FEDERAL LAW SO THE

05:02:59.294 --> 05:03:01.363
PREEMPTION CASE IS REALLY CLEAR

05:03:01.429 --> 05:03:02.531
AND AGAIN YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE

05:03:02.597 --> 05:03:03.765
MY WORD FOR THAT.

05:03:03.832 --> 05:03:05.300
THE LEGISLATIVE ADVOCATE FOR THE

05:03:05.367 --> 05:03:07.035
ELECTRONIC FRONTIER FOUNDATION

05:03:07.102 --> 05:03:08.336
ONE OF THE NATION'S LEADING

05:03:08.403 --> 05:03:10.038
PROPONENTS OF NET NEUTRALITY AND

05:03:10.105 --> 05:03:11.273
SUPPORTER OF THIS BILL.

05:03:11.339 --> 05:03:13.708
HAS SAID THERE'S A 10% CHANCE

05:03:13.775 --> 05:03:14.976
THAT THE STATE'S DIRECT

05:03:15.043 --> 05:03:16.845
REGULATION OF ISPS ON NET

05:03:16.912 --> 05:03:18.213
NEUTRALITY WILL SURVIVE A LEGAL

05:03:18.280 --> 05:03:21.683
CHALLENGE [inaudible] 10%.

05:03:21.750 --> 05:03:23.351
AND OF COURSE ON THE OTHER HAND

05:03:23.418 --> 05:03:25.620
THERE'S A 1100% CHANCE.

05:03:25.687 --> 05:03:27.255
PASSING THIS BILL WILL CREATE

05:03:27.322 --> 05:03:28.690

INTEREST THIS BILL IS GENERATED

05:03:40.201 --> 05:03:41.036
BECAUSE I'VE MET WITH A LOT OF

05:03:41.102 --> 05:03:42.804

05:03:42.871 --> 05:03:44.239

A POWERFUL STAKE IN THIS ISSUE

05:03:48.109 --> 05:03:49.511

05:03:49.578 --> 05:03:50.412
AND RIGHTLY SO.

05:03:50.478 --> 05:03:51.880
FEW TECHNOLOGIES IN HUMAN

05:03:51.947 --> 05:03:54.015
HISTORY HAVE PRODUCED SUCH A

05:03:54.082 --> 05:03:56.251

DIMENSIONS OF OUR PERSONAL.

05:04:01.990 --> 05:04:03.325
AND PROFESSIONAL LIVES THIRTY

05:04:03.391 --> 05:04:04.793
SECOND AND THE INTERNET IS NOT

05:04:04.859 --> 05:04:06.294
THE PROPERTY OF ANY ONE PERSON

05:04:06.361 --> 05:04:08.563

INTEREST IN THIS DEBATE.

05:04:17.606 --> 05:04:18.974
BUT IT'S ALSO WHY I BELIEVE

05:04:19.040 --> 05:04:21.209
THERE IS A FUNDAMENTAL MISMATCH

05:04:21.276 --> 05:04:22.777

NINE IN NINETEEN FORTY NINE THE

05:16:37.945 --> 05:16:38.946
SEC CAME UP WITH SOME THE CALL

05:16:39.013 --> 05:16:40.181
THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE.

05:16:40.247 --> 05:16:41.282
AND IT SOUNDED REALLY GOOD I'LL

05:16:41.349 --> 05:16:43.451
TELL YOU WHAT IT WAS.

05:16:43.517 --> 05:16:45.186
IT REQUIRED BROADCASTERS TO

05:16:45.252 --> 05:16:46.620
PRESENT CONTROVERSIAL ISSUES IN

05:16:46.687 --> 05:16:48.389
A MANNER THAT WAS HONEST.

05:16:48.456 --> 05:16:50.524
EQUITABLE AND BALLOTS.

05:16:50.591 --> 05:16:52.259
KIND OF SOUNDS LIKE FOX NEWS.

05:16:52.326 --> 05:16:55.096
THE PROBLEM IS.

05:16:55.162 --> 05:16:58.065
IS THAT BY.

05:16:58.132 --> 05:16:58.699
NINETEEN SIXTY SIX THE DEMOCRATS

05:16:58.766 --> 05:17:00.234
HAD FIGURED OUT THAT THIS IS A

05:17:00.301 --> 05:17:01.936
TOOL THAT THEY CAN USE.

05:17:02.002 --> 05:17:04.438
AND I WILL QUOTE.

05:17:04.505 --> 05:17:05.840
BILL RUDER FORMER ASSISTANT

05:17:05.906 --> 05:17:07.441
SECRETARY OF COMMERCE.

05:17:07.508 --> 05:17:09.210
UNDER PRESIDENT KENNEDY.

05:17:09.276 --> 05:17:11.278
WHO SAID THE FOLLOWING?

05:17:11.345 --> 05:17:13.414
OUR MASSIVE STRATEGY WAS TO USE

05:17:13.481 --> 05:17:14.615
THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE TO

05:17:14.682 --> 05:17:16.317
CHALLENGE AND HARASS RIGHT WING

05:17:16.384 --> 05:17:18.085
BROADCASTERS AND HOPE THAT THE

05:17:18.152 --> 05:17:19.820
CHALLENGES WOULD BE SO COSTLY TO

05:17:19.887 --> 05:17:20.855
THEM THAT THEY WOULD BE

05:17:20.921 --> 05:17:21.956
INHIBITED.

05:17:22.022 --> 05:17:23.824
AND DECIDED IT WAS TOO EXPENSIVE

05:17:23.891 --> 05:17:26.060
TO CONTINUE [inaudible]

05:17:26.127 --> 05:17:27.661
VERY SIMPLY.

05:17:27.728 --> 05:17:29.163
THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A LONG

05:17:29.230 --> 05:17:30.631
HISTORY OF USING SO CALLED

05:17:30.698 --> 05:17:32.299
FAIRNESS.

05:17:32.366 --> 05:17:34.468
AND RULES EXACTLY LIKE NET

05:17:34.535 --> 05:17:37.171
NEUTRALITY TO SILENCE SPEECH

05:17:37.238 --> 05:17:38.773
WITH WHICH THEY DISAGREE

05:17:38.839 --> 05:17:40.107
VIOLATING OUR FIRST AMENDMENT

05:17:40.174 --> 05:17:41.776
RIGHTS.

05:17:41.842 --> 05:17:45.479
BILL CLINTON EVEN RECOGNIZES IN

05:17:45.546 --> 05:17:45.780
[inaudible]

05:17:45.846 --> 05:17:47.481
NINETEEN NINETY SIX HE AMENDED.

05:17:47.548 --> 05:17:48.883
THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF

05:17:48.949 --> 05:17:50.918
NINETEEN THIRTY FOUR AND HE SAID.

05:17:50.985 --> 05:17:51.485
THAT THE INTERNET SHOULD BE

05:17:51.552 --> 05:17:53.621
UNFETTERED FROM FEDERAL OR STATE

05:17:53.687 --> 05:17:55.489
REGULATION.

05:17:55.556 --> 05:17:56.524
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN NET

05:17:56.590 --> 05:17:58.025
NEUTRALITY IS VERY SIMPLE THIS

05:17:58.092 --> 05:17:59.560
IS NOT ABOUT BEING A FEDERAL

05:17:59.627 --> 05:18:00.194
ISSUE OUR STATE ISSUES GOT NONE

05:18:00.261 --> 05:18:00.928
OF THAT.

05:18:00.995 --> 05:18:02.430
WHAT NET NEUTRALITY TRULY IS IS

05:18:02.496 --> 05:18:04.465
AN EFFORT?

05:18:04.532 --> 05:18:06.400
A CONCENTRATED EFFORT. TO

05:18:06.467 --> 05:18:08.269
REGULATE YOUR INTERNET.

05:18:08.335 --> 05:18:09.804
TREAT THE INTERNET LIKE A TITLE

05:18:09.870 --> 05:18:11.172
TO COMMON CARRIER AND SAID YOU

05:18:11.238 --> 05:18:13.040
THE SAME RULES THAT WE PUT UNDER

05:18:13.107 --> 05:18:14.375
TELECOMMUNICATIONS COMPANIES.

05:18:14.442 --> 05:18:16.977
TREAT THE INTERNET LIKE A STODGY

05:18:17.044 --> 05:18:19.447
UTILITY AND NOT THE VIBRANT

05:18:19.513 --> 05:18:21.415
DIVERSE.

05:18:21.482 --> 05:18:25.186
TOOL THAT WE ALL USE.

05:18:25.252 --> 05:18:27.188
NET NEUTRALITY IS ABOUT IDEA NET

05:18:27.254 --> 05:18:28.022
NEUTRALITY WILL LEAD TO HIGHER

05:18:28.088 --> 05:18:29.290
COST YOU LEAD TO SLOWER

05:18:29.356 --> 05:18:31.091
CONNECTIONS.

05:18:31.158 --> 05:18:32.626
NET NEUTRALITY WILL LEAD TO LESS

05:18:32.693 --> 05:18:34.562
CONTENT AND LESS DIVERSE VIEWS

05:18:34.628 --> 05:18:35.696
ON THE INTERNET.

05:18:35.763 --> 05:18:37.565
NET NEUTRALITY IS A VIOLATION OF

05:18:37.631 --> 05:18:39.667
YOUR FIRST AMENDMENT RIGHTS.

05:18:39.733 --> 05:18:41.202
BUT BEYOND ALL THAT.

05:18:41.268 --> 05:18:43.637
IT'S JUST A BAD IDEA.

05:18:43.704 --> 05:18:44.205
THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A LONG

05:18:44.271 --> 05:18:46.240
HISTORY OF TRYING TO REGULATE

05:18:46.307 --> 05:18:48.108
WHAT WE HEAR WHAT WE SEE AND

05:18:48.175 --> 05:18:49.143
WHAT WE BELIEVE.

05:18:49.210 --> 05:18:51.111
THERE'S NO FAKE NEWS OF THIS THE

05:18:51.178 --> 05:18:53.714
RECORD'S CLEAR NET NEUTRALITY IS

05:18:53.781 --> 05:18:55.616
THE NEXT VERSION OF THE FAIRNESS

05:18:55.683 --> 05:18:58.486
DOCTRINE. THIRTY CELULARES ROUND

05:18:58.552 --> 05:19:00.354
SOLVE THIS WAS A BAD IDEA.

05:19:00.421 --> 05:19:02.356
AS DID RONALD REAGAN.

05:19:02.423 --> 05:19:03.591
LET'S KEEP THE INTERNET.

05:19:03.657 --> 05:19:05.559
UNFETTERED FROM FEDERAL AND

05:19:05.626 --> 05:19:07.328

LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE ALL HAVE

05:19:10.164 --> 05:19:11.499
FASTER NET CONNECTIONS AND THE

05:19:11.565 --> 05:19:13.234
MARKET WILL ACTUALLY SORT THIS

05:19:13.300 --> 05:19:13.801
OUT.

05:19:13.868 --> 05:19:14.969
WE DON'T NEED THE GOVERNMENT TO

05:19:15.035 --> 05:19:15.936
SAVE US VOTE NO ON NET

05:19:16.003 --> 05:19:17.972

05:19:28.949 --> 05:19:30.217
COMES TO THESE TYPES OF ISSUES.

05:19:30.284 --> 05:19:31.585
WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO RELY ON THE

05:21:57.631 --> 05:21:59.199
BILL.

05:21:59.266 --> 05:22:00.701
HAS THE POTENTIAL TO IMPACT

05:22:00.768 --> 05:22:02.536
BROADBAND EXPANSION WHICH MANY

05:22:02.603 --> 05:22:05.572

BEING BROUGHT UP AS REASONS TO

05:22:37.304 --> 05:22:38.706

05:22:38.772 --> 05:22:42.109
HELP IT ACTUALLY HURTS CONSUMERS.

05:22:42.176 --> 05:22:43.844

SUBMITS OCCURRED HERE THE THE

05:23:43.003 --> 05:23:43.937
ISSUE THAT WAS BROUGHT UP

05:23:44.004 --> 05:23:44.571
ACTUALLY HELD A SELECT COMMITTEE

05:23:44.638 --> 05:23:46.306
ON THIS.

05:23:46.373 --> 05:23:47.741
AND ACTUALLY EXPLAIN WHAT HAD

05:23:47.808 --> 05:23:49.042

AND THE PEOPLE CALLED WAS A

05:23:52.679 --> 05:23:54.481
HUMAN ERROR ISSUE.

05:23:54.548 --> 05:23:56.150
ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY IT WAS

05:23:56.216 --> 05:23:57.551
OF THE COMPANY ITSELF

05:23:57.618 --> 05:23:58.652
PURPOSEFULLY SLOWING DOWN

05:23:58.719 --> 05:24:01.054
PEOPLE'S DATA.

05:24:01.121 --> 05:24:02.756
AND AND AND IN FACT THE COMPANY

05:24:02.823 --> 05:24:04.424
CAME BACK AND SAID NOW WE'RE

05:24:04.491 --> 05:24:06.393
GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT FOR

05:24:06.460 --> 05:24:07.828
EMERGENCY SERVICES IN THE STATE

05:24:07.895 --> 05:24:08.996
THAT THEY DO HAVE THAT.

05:24:09.062 --> 05:24:11.131
UNLIMITED DATA SO THAT THEY

05:24:11.198 --> 05:24:11.698
DON'T RUN INTO THAT PROBLEM

05:24:11.765 --> 05:24:13.066
AGAIN.

05:24:13.133 --> 05:24:14.134
SO.

05:24:14.201 --> 05:24:15.302
YOU EVEN THE ESSENCE OF THE

05:24:15.369 --> 05:24:16.270
PEOPLE ARE POINT AND OH BY THE

05:24:16.336 --> 05:24:18.172
WAY THE POLICY YOU'RE PASSING

05:24:18.238 --> 05:24:19.439
TODAY WOULD DO NOTHING ABOUT

05:24:19.506 --> 05:24:21.441
THAT SITUATION.

05:24:21.508 --> 05:24:23.477
BY THE WAY LET'S TELL THE TRUTH.

05:24:23.544 --> 05:24:25.245
THE POLICY OR PASSIVE THEY WOULD

05:24:25.312 --> 05:24:26.713
DO NOTHING ABOUT THAT SITUATION

05:24:26.780 --> 05:24:29.016
PERIOD.

05:24:29.082 --> 05:24:29.650
SO WHAT WE'RE REALLY HEAR ABOUT

05:24:29.716 --> 05:24:30.951
IS.

05:24:31.018 --> 05:24:33.720
AGAIN TRYING TO PLACATE. TO THE

05:24:33.787 --> 05:24:35.856
LEFT BASS.

05:24:35.923 --> 05:24:37.524
ENJOY YOUR OUT DO EACH OTHER IN

05:24:37.591 --> 05:24:39.827
FACT THIS BILL WAS KILLED --

05:24:39.893 --> 05:24:43.363
WAS STOPPED IN A COMMITTEE.

05:24:43.430 --> 05:24:44.598
AND THAT BRINGS ME TO ANOTHER

05:24:44.665 --> 05:24:45.632
POINT OF WHY WE'RE HERE YBER

05:24:45.699 --> 05:24:48.302
BULLYING.

05:24:48.368 --> 05:24:49.403
MAYBE WE SHOULD START TAKING

05:24:49.469 --> 05:24:51.004
THAT UP THAT ISSUE BECAUSE WHAT

05:24:51.071 --> 05:24:51.972
I'VE SEEN MORE SO.

05:24:52.039 --> 05:24:54.575
IS PEOPLE.

05:24:54.641 --> 05:24:56.844
BOWING DOWN TO THE BOWLING THAT

05:24:56.910 --> 05:24:59.112
THEY'RE RECEIVING ONLINE.

05:24:59.179 --> 05:25:00.848
AND FORCING PEOPLE TO PASS A BAD

05:25:00.914 --> 05:25:02.850
POLICY THAT'S NOT CONSISTENT

05:25:02.916 --> 05:25:04.651
WITH FEDERALISM.

05:25:04.718 --> 05:25:06.119
MSGOING TO CREATE A PATCHWORK

05:25:06.186 --> 05:25:07.454
OF THINGS ACTUALLY GONNA SLOW

05:25:07.521 --> 05:25:08.422
DOWN PEOPLE'S ABILITY TO GET

05:25:08.488 --> 05:25:10.157
GOOD DATA AND I FIND IT SO

05:25:10.224 --> 05:25:11.959
INTERESTING.

05:25:12.025 --> 05:25:13.594
THEY WE TALK ABOUT WHAT WE WANT

05:25:13.660 --> 05:25:15.162
TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS

05:25:15.229 --> 05:25:16.663
ACCESS TO ALL POINTS OF VIEW AND

05:25:16.730 --> 05:25:18.065
CONTENT.

05:25:18.131 --> 05:25:19.266
THE DATA WE DON'T WANT TO

05:25:19.333 --> 05:25:21.401
DISCRIMINATE AGAINST CONTENT.

05:25:21.468 --> 05:25:22.035
WHEN THIS BODY IS THE ONE THAT

05:25:22.102 --> 05:25:23.604
SAY THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD GET IN

05:25:23.670 --> 05:25:24.872
THE BUSINESS OF TELLING YOU WHAT

05:25:24.938 --> 05:25:26.640
IS FAKE NEWS AND WHAT'S NOT?

05:25:26.707 --> 05:25:28.275
JUST YESTERDAY WE WERE TALKING

05:25:28.342 --> 05:25:30.611
ABOUT THAT THE REAL THREAT. TO

05:25:30.677 --> 05:25:33.614
FREE SPEECH THE REAL THREAT WHEN

05:25:33.680 --> 05:25:35.148
IT COMES TO CENSORSHIP IS THIS

05:25:35.215 --> 05:25:37.184

DO THIS?

05:25:46.927 --> 05:25:48.462
ACTUALLY DISCRIMINATE BASED ON

05:25:48.528 --> 05:25:50.297
CONTENT ACTUALLY SAY THAT WE

05:25:50.364 --> 05:25:51.465
DON'T YOU ACTUALLY SLOW DOWN

05:25:51.531 --> 05:25:52.733

05:25:52.799 --> 05:25:54.568
CONTENT.

05:25:54.635 --> 05:25:55.702
FROM VIEW POINTS THAT THEY DON'T

05:25:55.769 --> 05:25:57.271
AGREE WITH.

05:25:57.337 --> 05:25:59.773
NOT THE HIGHEST PEAS.

05:25:59.840 --> 05:26:01.441

AND DO ANYTHING ABOUT THAT.

05:26:03.677 --> 05:26:05.145
BUT HEY IT'S JUST ANOTHER DAY

05:26:05.212 --> 05:26:07.581
HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE.

05:26:07.648 --> 05:26:09.483
MAYBE THIS BILL ONLY GET TO

05:26:09.549 --> 05:26:10.350
THIRTY NINE BUT DOESN'T MATTER

05:26:10.417 --> 05:26:11.551
WILL BULLY OUR WAY TO FORTY ONE

05:26:11.618 --> 05:26:18.091
RIGHT.

05:26:18.158 --> 05:26:20.193
ALL DEBATE AND DISCUSSION HAVING

05:26:20.260 --> 05:26:25.098

BUT THERE'S A PHILOSOPHICAL

05:26:33.974 --> 05:26:35.108
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOME OF OUR

05:26:35.175 --> 05:26:36.109
FRIENDS ON THE OPPOSITE SIDE OF

05:26:36.176 --> 05:26:38.045
THE AISLE --

05:26:38.111 --> 05:26:39.112
IN TERMS OF THE ISSUE OF NET

05:26:39.179 --> 05:26:41.415
NEUTRALITY BUT I'M STILL HOPEFUL

05:26:41.481 --> 05:26:42.716
THAT THEY'LL BE PIE PARTISAN

05:26:42.783 --> 05:26:43.350

05:26:43.417 --> 05:26:44.318
THE DAY.

I THINK TRULY THAT YOU BELIEVE

05:26:45.953 --> 05:26:46.920
THAT THERE SHOULD BE AN OPEN.

05:26:46.987 --> 05:26:48.689
AND FREE INTERNET.

05:26:48.755 --> 05:26:52.192
I HEAR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA.

05:26:52.259 --> 05:26:53.193
THIS BILL IS REALLY A QUESTION

05:26:53.260 --> 05:26:55.729

AND A FREE AND OPEN INTERNET.

05:27:05.238 --> 05:27:05.772
AND IT'S PRETTY SIMPLE BECAUSE

05:27:05.839 --> 05:27:07.607
IF YOU DO.

05:27:07.674 --> 05:27:08.375

05:27:08.442 --> 05:27:10.677
MEANS YES.

05:27:10.744 --> 05:27:12.012
AND IF YOU DON'T.

05:27:12.079 --> 05:27:13.547
YOU PRESS THE RED.

05:27:13.613 --> 05:27:15.949
