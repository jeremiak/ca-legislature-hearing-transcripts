WEBVTT

00:00:07.307 --> 00:00:09.042
good morning and -- thank you

00:00:09.109 --> 00:00:10.777
all for being here welcome

00:00:10.844 --> 00:00:12.846
to our informational hearing

00:00:12.912 --> 00:00:14.447
being conducted by the joint

00:00:14.514 --> 00:00:16.149
legislative committee on

00:00:16.216 --> 00:00:17.884
emergency management and the

00:00:17.951 --> 00:00:19.152
assembly select committee

00:00:19.219 --> 00:00:21.221
on natural disaster response

00:00:21.721 --> 00:00:23.857
recovery and rebuilding

00:00:23.923 --> 00:00:25.825
today's discussion will be

00:00:26.159 --> 00:00:27.694
on the alert strengthening

00:00:27.761 --> 00:00:29.596
California's public warning

00:00:29.662 --> 00:00:32.665
systems I do have an opening

00:00:32.732 --> 00:00:35.402
statement -- but before I read

00:00:35.468 --> 00:00:37.704
that I I feel compelled to

00:00:37.771 --> 00:00:39.305
make the following statement

00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:42.242
-- we are sitting here in

00:00:42.308 --> 00:00:44.077
Carpinteria California which

00:00:44.344 --> 00:00:46.045
less the or a little over a year

00:00:46.112 --> 00:00:47.447
ago I guess it was less than a

00:00:47.514 --> 00:00:49.549
year ago -- we suffer through

00:00:49.616 --> 00:00:50.750
what was that at the time

00:00:50.817 --> 00:00:52.452
the worst wildfire in history

00:00:52.519 --> 00:00:55.188
California -- it started

00:00:55.255 --> 00:00:57.357
December fourth during our so

00:00:57.424 --> 00:00:59.959
called off season and burned for

00:01:00.026 --> 00:01:02.228
forty days moving up from Santa

00:01:02.295 --> 00:01:04.831
Paula in Ventura county to past

00:01:04.898 --> 00:01:06.533
where we are right now ending

00:01:06.599 --> 00:01:09.135
up over monta Seto in

00:01:09.903 --> 00:01:11.404
next to the city Santa Barbara

00:01:11.805 --> 00:01:14.174
and of course -- resulting in

00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:15.909
a debris flow two weeks later

00:01:16.176 --> 00:01:17.477
they killed twenty three people

00:01:18.878 --> 00:01:20.613
we have since that period

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:22.282
of time we are no longer the

00:01:22.348 --> 00:01:24.350
worst -- or the largest fired

00:01:24.417 --> 00:01:25.985
wildfire in California history

00:01:26.052 --> 00:01:27.887
we've been superseded now on

00:01:27.954 --> 00:01:29.556
several occasions just within

00:01:29.622 --> 00:01:31.558
the last twelve months so

00:01:31.624 --> 00:01:34.194
it makes us ask the question

00:01:34.761 --> 00:01:36.563
of what is going on

00:01:37.831 --> 00:01:39.165
and frankly it's really

00:01:39.232 --> 00:01:40.667
tragic that we're here today

00:01:40.733 --> 00:01:42.035
to discuss how to deal with

00:01:42.101 --> 00:01:43.837
raging wildfires that have

00:01:43.903 --> 00:01:46.172
become the new abnormal in our

00:01:46.239 --> 00:01:48.741
state these fires have snuffed

00:01:48.808 --> 00:01:50.877
out lives of over a hundred

00:01:50.944 --> 00:01:52.278
and fifty Californians in

00:01:52.345 --> 00:01:54.647
the past year alone destroyed

00:01:54.714 --> 00:01:56.616
homes and property in the

00:01:56.683 --> 00:01:58.585
hopes and dreams of thousands

00:01:59.118 --> 00:02:01.120
our failure to listen to

00:02:01.187 --> 00:02:02.589
the plaintive cry of mother

00:02:02.655 --> 00:02:05.058
nature that we are warming

00:02:05.124 --> 00:02:07.360
our natural climate creating

00:02:07.427 --> 00:02:09.629
severe and dramatic changes in

00:02:09.696 --> 00:02:11.931
our weather leading to extreme

00:02:11.998 --> 00:02:14.834
drought winds and conditions

00:02:15.335 --> 00:02:16.936
that have now led us to the

00:02:17.003 --> 00:02:19.372
point we're at here today and

00:02:19.439 --> 00:02:21.975
even after in undisputed bull

00:02:22.041 --> 00:02:24.344
scientific study was released

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.980
trust this past week national

00:02:27.046 --> 00:02:29.749
leaders continue to foolishly

00:02:30.383 --> 00:02:31.718
did not hide the challenging

00:02:31.784 --> 00:02:33.253
conditions of our planet

00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:35.955
recklessly and irresponsibly

00:02:36.222 --> 00:02:38.625
blaming those they do not like

00:02:38.825 --> 00:02:40.827
for something that is obviously

00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:42.996
occurring as a result of

00:02:43.062 --> 00:02:45.532
human behavior all that

00:02:45.598 --> 00:02:48.501
aside we are here and today

00:02:48.568 --> 00:02:50.236
we meet at the epicenter of

00:02:50.303 --> 00:02:51.771
one of these disasters the

00:02:51.838 --> 00:02:53.973
Thomas fire again it occurred

00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.309
not even a year ago and which

00:02:56.376 --> 00:02:58.645
has been supplanted over the

00:02:58.711 --> 00:03:00.813
past several months by larger

00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:03.116
fires by more deadly fires

00:03:03.449 --> 00:03:05.318
fires that have existed during

00:03:05.385 --> 00:03:07.620
our so called rainy season and

00:03:07.687 --> 00:03:09.822
so here we are so with

00:03:09.889 --> 00:03:11.958
the state of California come

00:03:12.025 --> 00:03:13.660
together to try to find ways

00:03:13.726 --> 00:03:15.228
to reverse this threat to our

00:03:15.295 --> 00:03:17.263
communities and as governor

00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:19.332
brown has referred to it as the

00:03:19.399 --> 00:03:21.901
existential crisis of our time

00:03:22.468 --> 00:03:25.104
he is not wrong and I ask

00:03:25.171 --> 00:03:26.539
how many times does mother

00:03:26.606 --> 00:03:28.308
nature have to hit us in the

00:03:28.374 --> 00:03:30.510
face with a two by four for us

00:03:30.577 --> 00:03:33.079
to start recognizing that we

00:03:33.146 --> 00:03:35.848
must change the way we

00:03:36.149 --> 00:03:38.851
work and live and provide

00:03:39.319 --> 00:03:41.054
within our communities

00:03:41.888 --> 00:03:43.923
this is going to continue

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:47.860
unless we immediately recognize

00:03:47.927 --> 00:03:49.862
our behavior is creating the

00:03:49.929 --> 00:03:52.098
circumstances that have led

00:03:52.165 --> 00:03:54.200
to these fires in these deaths

00:03:54.701 --> 00:03:56.536
and so we are here today

00:03:57.604 --> 00:03:59.238
to work to protect our

00:03:59.305 --> 00:04:01.441
people our property our

00:04:01.507 --> 00:04:03.810
communities by focusing

00:04:04.077 --> 00:04:06.546
on this is issue a public

00:04:06.613 --> 00:04:08.982
warning systems it is not

00:04:09.349 --> 00:04:10.883
going to fix the problem

00:04:11.751 --> 00:04:14.253
we must try to fix the problem

00:04:14.621 --> 00:04:16.456
but in the interim we are here

00:04:16.522 --> 00:04:17.957
working on waste that we can

00:04:18.024 --> 00:04:20.026
protect our communities it is

00:04:20.093 --> 00:04:21.961
our responsibility is government

00:04:22.195 --> 00:04:24.030
it is our responsibility as

00:04:24.097 --> 00:04:25.531
human beings living on this

00:04:25.598 --> 00:04:27.800
planet and it's one that we must

00:04:27.867 --> 00:04:30.503
start to take more seriously

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.405
and act more dramatically

00:04:32.605 --> 00:04:34.207
while we figure out ways in

00:04:34.273 --> 00:04:35.775
the interim to protect the

00:04:35.842 --> 00:04:37.543
people who make up our great

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:40.046
state and with that I'd like

00:04:40.113 --> 00:04:41.247

to these horrific conditions

00:06:22.248 --> 00:06:25.017

conversation -- our witnesses

assignments -- in their home

00:07:36.889 --> 00:07:38.391
jurisdictions or deployments

00:07:38.457 --> 00:07:40.493
elsewhere throughout the state

00:07:40.827 --> 00:07:42.762
-- using our mutual aid network

00:07:42.829 --> 00:07:44.730
which is an extraordinary --

00:07:44.797 --> 00:07:46.032
system that we have here in

00:07:46.098 --> 00:07:48.901
California which is responsible

00:07:48.968 --> 00:07:50.469
for doing the extraordinary

00:07:50.536 --> 00:07:51.737
job in dealing with these

00:07:51.804 --> 00:07:53.739
horrific fires reducing the

00:07:53.806 --> 00:07:56.075
potential loss of life -- is

00:07:56.142 --> 00:07:58.077
significantly as we have and

00:07:58.144 --> 00:07:59.078
putting out some of these

00:07:59.145 --> 00:08:01.013
fires that would otherwise

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.449
continue to rage on perhaps

00:08:03.516 --> 00:08:06.352
indefinitely -- we have --

00:08:07.353 --> 00:08:09.555
also a Louisiana and seen this

00:08:09.822 --> 00:08:11.591
the bilingual public outreach

00:08:11.657 --> 00:08:13.359
coordinator for the city of

00:08:13.426 --> 00:08:14.927
Santa Barbara fire department

00:08:14.994 --> 00:08:16.495
to is here with us today we

00:08:16.562 --> 00:08:18.731
have issues said I know assembly

00:08:18.798 --> 00:08:19.866
member Limon will mention

00:08:19.932 --> 00:08:21.434
them -- dealing with making

00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:23.269
sure that all our population

00:08:23.603 --> 00:08:25.638
gets appropriate messages in

00:08:25.705 --> 00:08:27.607
languages that they are able to

00:08:27.673 --> 00:08:30.276
understand -- when we have the

00:08:30.343 --> 00:08:31.777
significant events I remember

00:08:31.844 --> 00:08:33.579
when we had the -- Thomas

00:08:33.646 --> 00:08:35.948
fire it was translated as the

00:08:36.349 --> 00:08:38.718
hair brush fire and obviously

00:08:38.784 --> 00:08:39.986
when I hear brushes on fire

00:08:40.052 --> 00:08:41.420
you're not quite is concerned

00:08:41.854 --> 00:08:43.522
-- and of course they did have

00:08:43.589 --> 00:08:46.225
some -- detrimental impacts

00:08:46.292 --> 00:08:47.860
as a result of that poor

00:08:48.094 --> 00:08:50.162
interpretation that -- that

00:08:50.229 --> 00:08:51.964
was submitted to the community

00:08:52.365 --> 00:08:54.533
-- but -- Liliana thank you

00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:55.835
for being here she's a state

00:08:55.902 --> 00:08:57.103
coordinator for the least those

00:08:57.169 --> 00:08:59.305
program -- her name doesn't

00:08:59.372 --> 00:09:00.573
appear on the agenda but she

00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:02.074
will take part in the next

00:09:02.141 --> 00:09:04.043
steps panel toward the end of

00:09:04.110 --> 00:09:05.978
the hearing this is the third

00:09:06.045 --> 00:09:08.180
hearing in a series examining

00:09:08.247 --> 00:09:09.548
our emergency public warning

00:09:09.615 --> 00:09:12.184
systems ironically last year

00:09:12.251 --> 00:09:13.986
on December fourth we held I

00:09:14.053 --> 00:09:15.087
think was our first hearing

00:09:15.154 --> 00:09:16.689
on the subject after the tubs

00:09:16.756 --> 00:09:18.958
fire in the Sonoma fires -- to

00:09:19.025 --> 00:09:20.993
talk about that system little

00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:22.194
did I know that an hour and

00:09:22.261 --> 00:09:23.696
a half after banging down the

00:09:23.763 --> 00:09:25.865
gavel saying hopefully we have

00:09:25.932 --> 00:09:27.500
a little rest but it's December

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:29.502
-- we should be able to pull

00:09:29.568 --> 00:09:31.270
together some of these best

00:09:31.337 --> 00:09:32.872
practices that an hour and

00:09:32.939 --> 00:09:34.273
a half later the Thomas fire

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.043
started -- an irony

00:09:37.109 --> 00:09:39.512
that will never leave me --

00:09:39.779 --> 00:09:42.615
we have as I mentioned

00:09:42.682 --> 00:09:44.083
-- had that hearing in December

00:09:44.150 --> 00:09:45.718
fourth on March seventh

00:09:45.918 --> 00:09:47.086
the committee held a second

00:09:47.153 --> 00:09:48.888
hearing focused on California's

00:09:48.955 --> 00:09:51.257
decision to opt into the first

00:09:51.324 --> 00:09:53.092
net public safety network

00:09:53.159 --> 00:09:55.027
managed -- by the federal

00:09:55.094 --> 00:09:57.096
national telecommunications and

00:09:57.163 --> 00:09:59.799
information administration --

00:09:59.865 --> 00:10:01.067
we will perhaps have further

00:10:01.133 --> 00:10:02.568
discussion about the various

00:10:02.635 --> 00:10:04.136
different programs and systems

00:10:04.203 --> 00:10:05.604
that are available but the

00:10:05.671 --> 00:10:07.106
goal of these two hearings was

00:10:07.173 --> 00:10:09.342
to educate state policymakers

00:10:09.642 --> 00:10:11.377
on how these two categories

00:10:11.444 --> 00:10:13.412
of emergency communications

00:10:13.479 --> 00:10:15.581
networks functioned and to

00:10:15.648 --> 00:10:17.550
identify areas for improvement

00:10:17.883 --> 00:10:20.486
-- which led to -- the passage

00:10:20.553 --> 00:10:22.388
of I believe it was for --

00:10:22.455 --> 00:10:24.957
pieces of legislation last

00:10:25.024 --> 00:10:26.792
year we will be discussing

00:10:27.093 --> 00:10:28.561
-- how those -- pieces

00:10:28.627 --> 00:10:29.962
of legislation are being

00:10:30.029 --> 00:10:32.565
implemented and -- we will

00:10:32.631 --> 00:10:34.066
proceed with that discussion

00:10:34.133 --> 00:10:35.735
here in just a couple minutes

00:10:36.035 --> 00:10:38.137
we do know there is more work

00:10:38.204 --> 00:10:39.905
to be done to create a more

00:10:39.972 --> 00:10:42.141
robust reliable and effective

00:10:42.208 --> 00:10:44.276
network a public warning systems

00:10:44.643 --> 00:10:46.812
across the state and as we know

00:10:46.879 --> 00:10:48.481
the stakes cannot be higher

00:10:48.681 --> 00:10:50.750
so -- rather than go through

00:10:50.816 --> 00:10:52.518
the various fires that we've

00:10:52.585 --> 00:10:55.121
had in the past twelve months

00:10:55.354 --> 00:10:56.455
some of which are literally

00:10:56.522 --> 00:10:58.591
still smoldering -- we're we're

00:10:58.657 --> 00:11:00.459
trying to wreck -- identify the

00:11:00.526 --> 00:11:03.162
remains of those who but in

00:11:03.229 --> 00:11:04.397
addition to now the eighty

00:11:04.463 --> 00:11:05.631
eight who lost their lives

00:11:05.698 --> 00:11:08.100
at the campfire -- in others

00:11:08.167 --> 00:11:10.236
and the will see fire -- in all

00:11:10.302 --> 00:11:11.937
the other tragedies that we've

00:11:12.004 --> 00:11:13.239
been suffering we have work to

00:11:13.305 --> 00:11:16.175
do -- we have to move forward

00:11:16.242 --> 00:11:17.977
we have to try on a national

00:11:18.044 --> 00:11:19.578
level to the extent possible

00:11:19.645 --> 00:11:21.380
as well as within our state to

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:24.116
everything we can to protect

00:11:24.183 --> 00:11:26.018
the public which is our primary

00:11:26.085 --> 00:11:27.453
responsibility is government

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:29.555
so with that -- I'd like to

00:11:29.622 --> 00:11:31.657
invite my co chairs to offer

00:11:31.891 --> 00:11:33.692
an opening statement and --

00:11:33.759 --> 00:11:36.295
also have a -- statement from

00:11:36.362 --> 00:11:38.264
assembly member Gallagher and

00:11:38.330 --> 00:11:39.498
if one of you would like to read

00:11:39.565 --> 00:11:41.534
that as well you may note he is

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:42.868
the is assembly member in the

00:11:42.935 --> 00:11:45.838
area of the -- campfire

00:11:45.905 --> 00:11:47.206
in office he was unable to

00:11:47.273 --> 00:11:50.109
join us today so Mister culture

00:11:51.477 --> 00:11:53.079
toss it over to my colleague --

00:11:53.145 --> 00:11:54.747
assembly member Monique Limon

00:11:54.814 --> 00:11:56.348
thank you thank you all of you

00:11:56.415 --> 00:11:57.917
for being here and and those

00:11:57.983 --> 00:12:00.252
watching online or at home --

00:12:00.319 --> 00:12:02.755
a think as is been said it

00:12:03.589 --> 00:12:05.858
we had a thought about gathering

00:12:05.925 --> 00:12:07.259
and having this conversation

00:12:07.326 --> 00:12:08.594
independent of what's happened

00:12:08.661 --> 00:12:09.728
over the last month and the

00:12:09.795 --> 00:12:12.898
fires -- in primarily it was our

00:12:12.965 --> 00:12:15.734
chance and ability to reassess

00:12:15.801 --> 00:12:18.404
where we've been a number of

00:12:18.637 --> 00:12:20.072
when we first had a hearing in

00:12:20.139 --> 00:12:21.941
our district I think you know

00:12:22.007 --> 00:12:24.110
several months ago we we shared

00:12:24.376 --> 00:12:26.378
the dozens of bills that had

00:12:26.445 --> 00:12:28.547
moved forward -- related to

00:12:28.614 --> 00:12:30.516
and natural disaster response

00:12:30.583 --> 00:12:33.285
emergency notifications -- and

00:12:33.352 --> 00:12:34.687
there after everything that

00:12:34.753 --> 00:12:36.155
that that comes thereafter

00:12:36.222 --> 00:12:38.958
related to recovery and --

00:12:39.558 --> 00:12:41.994
meal we've learned in California

00:12:42.061 --> 00:12:43.395
that even the fires that we

00:12:43.462 --> 00:12:45.397
talked about -- a year ago

00:12:45.464 --> 00:12:47.933
that we lived in experience --

00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.536
are all identical and that

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:53.572
-- at as much as we rely

00:12:53.639 --> 00:12:55.774
on -- our abilities as human

00:12:55.841 --> 00:12:57.510
beings on science to give us

00:12:57.576 --> 00:13:00.112
directions -- about what to

00:13:00.179 --> 00:13:01.914
do and how to do things that

00:13:01.981 --> 00:13:03.716
there are the magnitude of what

00:13:03.782 --> 00:13:05.451
we've lived -- in the state of

00:13:05.518 --> 00:13:08.254
California -- has grown to an

00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:09.455
extent that we didn't really

00:13:09.522 --> 00:13:11.123
think was possible we thought

00:13:11.190 --> 00:13:12.691
that even with these laws in

00:13:12.758 --> 00:13:15.528
place -- and knowing

00:13:15.594 --> 00:13:17.029
the direction we wanted to go

00:13:17.096 --> 00:13:19.965
into -- it would certainly help

00:13:20.032 --> 00:13:22.468
-- an aids the situation and

00:13:22.535 --> 00:13:24.603
I want to be clear that the laws

00:13:24.670 --> 00:13:26.505
that we put in place the are the

00:13:26.572 --> 00:13:28.440
hearings that we have do help

00:13:28.774 --> 00:13:30.910
the do you aid in the situation

00:13:31.210 --> 00:13:33.679
-- but a one hundred percent

00:13:34.180 --> 00:13:37.216
remedy to these fires isn't

00:13:37.283 --> 00:13:39.685
nearly impossible -- I think

00:13:40.319 --> 00:13:41.520
those of us that represent

00:13:41.587 --> 00:13:44.156
these areas know that and now

00:13:44.657 --> 00:13:47.026
I see the coalition of members

00:13:47.092 --> 00:13:48.794
who represent impacted areas

00:13:48.861 --> 00:13:50.596
growing -- and he needs a

00:13:50.663 --> 00:13:52.531
coalition that we worry about

00:13:52.598 --> 00:13:54.533
how fast it's growing we now

00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.368
have more members -- throughout

00:13:56.435 --> 00:13:58.003
the state of California that

00:13:58.070 --> 00:14:00.039
are feeling the impact of

00:14:00.639 --> 00:14:02.975
of these wild fire specifically

00:14:03.042 --> 00:14:04.944
and that is a concern to us but

00:14:05.010 --> 00:14:06.512
what we're here to do today is

00:14:06.579 --> 00:14:09.315
also to listen to what has

00:14:09.381 --> 00:14:11.717
worked on what one maybe hasn't

00:14:11.784 --> 00:14:13.953
work what we need to change and

00:14:14.019 --> 00:14:15.621
to accept the fact that this is

00:14:15.688 --> 00:14:17.756
an evolving conversation that

00:14:17.823 --> 00:14:19.625
we don't necessarily have a

00:14:19.692 --> 00:14:22.027
magic bullet at once but that we

00:14:22.094 --> 00:14:23.829
assess and that we come together

00:14:23.896 --> 00:14:26.065
from experts -- who are on the

00:14:26.131 --> 00:14:28.634
ground -- dealing with some of

00:14:28.701 --> 00:14:30.402
the emergency to those of us

00:14:30.469 --> 00:14:32.972
that are thinking more about

00:14:33.038 --> 00:14:34.707
the the impact of laws and what

00:14:34.773 --> 00:14:36.342
things need to change and and

00:14:36.408 --> 00:14:38.244
how we think about this so I

00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:39.912
want to thank my colleagues on

00:14:39.979 --> 00:14:42.114
for being here -- regrettably

00:14:42.181 --> 00:14:43.582
we've all had very first hand

00:14:43.649 --> 00:14:45.851
experience -- with this and also

00:14:45.918 --> 00:14:47.753
think everyone else for being

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:48.954
here all of those of you that

00:14:49.021 --> 00:14:50.823
are going to testify -- I feel

00:14:50.889 --> 00:14:52.458
like we were becoming friends

00:14:52.524 --> 00:14:53.826
that very quickly because

00:14:53.892 --> 00:14:55.628
we keep seeing each other --

00:14:55.694 --> 00:14:56.795
the because there's so much

00:14:56.862 --> 00:14:58.597
happening in our community but

00:14:58.664 --> 00:15:00.766
this is an opportunity to take

00:15:00.833 --> 00:15:03.168
back what we learned what we

00:15:03.235 --> 00:15:05.304
discussed today to accept that

00:15:05.371 --> 00:15:06.939
things are going to be involving

00:15:07.006 --> 00:15:08.474
and that we may not have a magic

00:15:08.874 --> 00:15:12.011
bullet but also at to recognize

00:15:12.077 --> 00:15:13.612
that both the state assembly

00:15:13.679 --> 00:15:14.947
and the state Senate are

00:15:15.014 --> 00:15:16.248
committed to this this is why

00:15:16.315 --> 00:15:18.350
you see a joint hearing -- I do

00:15:18.417 --> 00:15:19.752
believe that will have another

00:15:19.818 --> 00:15:22.121
US senator joining us and you

00:15:22.187 --> 00:15:23.355
know at about ten thirty or

00:15:23.422 --> 00:15:25.658
so and and -- a do you want

00:15:25.724 --> 00:15:28.160
to share the statement -- from

the communities of paradise

00:15:45.944 --> 00:15:48.213
-- as long as well as others

and couldn't be here today

00:15:49.415 --> 00:15:51.083

00:15:57.756 --> 00:15:59.925
sadness and shared grief with

00:15:59.992 --> 00:16:01.126
my community that I have to

00:16:01.193 --> 00:16:03.829
report of yet another tragic

00:16:03.896 --> 00:16:05.397
wildfire cleaning the lives

00:16:05.464 --> 00:16:06.999
and property of Californians

00:16:07.833 --> 00:16:10.336
after last year's fires I hoped

00:16:10.402 --> 00:16:12.538
it couldn't get worse it

00:16:12.604 --> 00:16:15.374
has I never could have found

00:16:15.441 --> 00:16:16.742
them that my district would

00:16:16.809 --> 00:16:18.610
be the site of the deadliest

00:16:18.677 --> 00:16:20.713
wildfire in California history

00:16:21.547 --> 00:16:22.881
we are up to eighty eight

00:16:22.948 --> 00:16:25.184
people confirmed dead and over

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.852
fifteen thousand structures

00:16:26.919 --> 00:16:29.455
destroyed the communities of

00:16:29.521 --> 00:16:31.724
không cal paradise Mongolia

00:16:31.957 --> 00:16:33.292
have been disseminated

00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.128
but as many of you on the

00:16:36.195 --> 00:16:37.563
select committee know all too

00:16:37.629 --> 00:16:40.165
well devastating wildfire is

00:16:41.367 --> 00:16:42.668
and has been an imminent

00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:44.870
threat in California and in

00:16:44.937 --> 00:16:47.406
recent years due to the drought

00:16:47.773 --> 00:16:50.509
high fuel levels low moisture

00:16:50.743 --> 00:16:52.878
and ever increasing high winds

00:16:53.545 --> 00:16:55.781
have become an even more deadly

00:16:56.682 --> 00:16:57.883
had become even more deadly

00:16:57.950 --> 00:17:00.119
for our communities this fire

00:17:00.185 --> 00:17:01.920
moves faster than anyone could

00:17:01.987 --> 00:17:04.089
have imagined it started in

00:17:04.156 --> 00:17:05.591
a remote area off highway

00:17:05.657 --> 00:17:07.426
seventy into rain that was

00:17:07.493 --> 00:17:09.361
extremely difficult to reach

00:17:09.428 --> 00:17:11.930
by firefighters it was quickly

00:17:11.997 --> 00:17:13.732
blown to fifty miles per hour

00:17:13.799 --> 00:17:16.168
winds and within two short

00:17:16.235 --> 00:17:17.536
hours had blazed through the

00:17:17.603 --> 00:17:20.005
communities of con cal jumped

00:17:20.272 --> 00:17:22.441
to canyons and was already

00:17:22.508 --> 00:17:24.843
lightning lighting fires in

00:17:24.910 --> 00:17:26.311
the community of paradise

00:17:26.745 --> 00:17:29.281
quite simply no one expected

00:17:29.348 --> 00:17:31.150
it to move this fast

00:17:32.217 --> 00:17:34.453
respond hers have likened it

00:17:34.887 --> 00:17:37.289
unto a flame thrower which shot

00:17:37.523 --> 00:17:40.058
fiery embers up to a mile from

00:17:40.125 --> 00:17:42.060
the fire line beginning new

00:17:42.127 --> 00:17:44.530
spot fires which in turn were

00:17:44.596 --> 00:17:46.999
blown even further down

00:17:47.065 --> 00:17:49.468
when I don't pretend to have

00:17:49.535 --> 00:17:51.136
the answers to how we prevent

00:17:51.203 --> 00:17:52.704
tragedies like this from

00:17:52.771 --> 00:17:55.240
happening I know you are

00:17:55.307 --> 00:17:56.775
discussing warning systems

00:17:56.842 --> 00:17:58.911
today all I can tell you

00:17:58.977 --> 00:18:00.979
today is that this happen in

00:18:01.046 --> 00:18:03.348
communities that were very

00:18:03.415 --> 00:18:06.819
fire aware that had evacuation

00:18:06.885 --> 00:18:09.354
plans and strategies in place

00:18:09.988 --> 00:18:11.623
that had a practice and

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:14.359
simulated evacuations and

00:18:14.426 --> 00:18:16.228
that had led community efforts

00:18:16.295 --> 00:18:17.896
to get people signed up for

00:18:17.963 --> 00:18:20.132
warning system like code red

00:18:21.266 --> 00:18:22.935
the fire move faster than we

00:18:23.001 --> 00:18:25.604
prepared for in the end we still

00:18:25.671 --> 00:18:27.306
had people who said they had

00:18:27.539 --> 00:18:29.842
no notice and we still had

00:18:29.908 --> 00:18:32.077
traffic jams during evacuation

00:18:32.344 --> 00:18:33.645
that prevented people from

00:18:33.712 --> 00:18:35.447
getting to safety fast enough

00:18:37.049 --> 00:18:38.317
knowing that we had these

00:18:38.383 --> 00:18:40.185
types of fires to contend with

00:18:41.019 --> 00:18:42.688
we will mostly we will most

00:18:42.754 --> 00:18:45.557
definitely need to up our

00:18:45.624 --> 00:18:48.227
game I am committed as

00:18:48.293 --> 00:18:50.295
I know you are to finding out

00:18:50.362 --> 00:18:52.564
how we can do so thank you

00:18:52.631 --> 00:18:53.866

00:18:53.932 --> 00:18:55.434
to this important matter and

00:18:55.501 --> 00:18:56.969
I look forward to working with

00:18:57.035 --> 00:18:58.337
you to find the answers in

00:18:58.403 --> 00:19:00.639
the coming legislative session

00:19:01.073 --> 00:19:02.941
assembly member James Gallagher

00:19:05.477 --> 00:19:06.912
with those words I will pass it

00:19:06.979 --> 00:19:08.981
on to our co chair Marc Levine

state as we're going through

00:19:32.304 --> 00:19:34.706
-- these disasters and the

00:19:34.773 --> 00:19:37.042
impacts of climate change above

00:19:37.109 --> 00:19:38.810
all I'd like to take a moment

00:19:38.877 --> 00:19:41.013
to recognize on the Los that

00:19:41.079 --> 00:19:42.814
the state has experienced over

00:19:42.881 --> 00:19:44.216
the past thirteen or fourteen

00:19:44.283 --> 00:19:46.451
months and also of the

00:19:46.518 --> 00:19:48.220
sacrifices of brave women and

00:19:48.287 --> 00:19:49.521
men across the state who risk

00:19:49.588 --> 00:19:51.290
their lives to protect us their

00:19:51.356 --> 00:19:53.759
efforts do not go unnoticed

00:19:55.127 --> 00:19:57.229
one -- on Wednesday thanksgiving

00:19:57.296 --> 00:19:58.497
eve I had an opportunity

00:19:58.564 --> 00:20:01.133
visit the camp fire and

00:20:01.199 --> 00:20:02.367
see firsthand the faces of

00:20:02.434 --> 00:20:04.169
displaced residents devastated

00:20:04.236 --> 00:20:05.938
by yet another wildfire in

00:20:06.004 --> 00:20:07.239
California assemblymember

00:20:07.306 --> 00:20:09.841
Gallagher's words -- could not

00:20:09.908 --> 00:20:11.777
-- describe more accurately what

00:20:11.843 --> 00:20:14.079
I heard -- on Wednesday night

00:20:14.746 --> 00:20:17.149
-- I listened -- to both

00:20:17.215 --> 00:20:19.251
-- survivors and public safety

00:20:19.318 --> 00:20:21.453
personnel who detailed countless

00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.555
close calls in horror stories

00:20:23.855 --> 00:20:25.357
from the initial hours of

00:20:25.424 --> 00:20:27.326
evacuation the devastation

00:20:27.392 --> 00:20:28.860
is all too reminiscent of

00:20:28.927 --> 00:20:31.096
the then record setting fires

00:20:31.163 --> 00:20:32.631
and twenty seventeen -- the

00:20:32.698 --> 00:20:33.699
effects of which we are still

00:20:33.765 --> 00:20:35.634
recovering from -- in the

00:20:35.701 --> 00:20:37.903
North Bay as well as here

00:20:38.270 --> 00:20:40.138
in not in Santa Barbara and

00:20:40.205 --> 00:20:42.374
Ventura county all while I have

00:20:42.441 --> 00:20:43.408
friends and acquaintances who

00:20:43.475 --> 00:20:45.143
lost their homes in the North

00:20:45.210 --> 00:20:46.945
Bay fires last year it was

00:20:47.012 --> 00:20:49.214
the Thomas fire that took at

00:20:49.281 --> 00:20:50.849
the home of one of my family

00:20:50.916 --> 00:20:53.018
members here inventor county

00:20:53.685 --> 00:20:55.721
-- it is clear that each

00:20:55.787 --> 00:20:56.922
subsequent year will force

00:20:56.989 --> 00:20:58.824
us as residents public safety

00:20:58.890 --> 00:21:01.059
personnel and lawmakers to

00:21:01.126 --> 00:21:02.794
face an ever changing emergency

00:21:02.861 --> 00:21:04.363
landscape not only with the

00:21:04.429 --> 00:21:06.264
threat of fires but mud slides

00:21:06.531 --> 00:21:08.500
earthquakes floods and other

00:21:08.567 --> 00:21:11.336
unforeseen disasters and it

00:21:11.403 --> 00:21:12.371
was earlier this year that I

00:21:12.437 --> 00:21:13.972
join my colleagues some Amberley

00:21:14.039 --> 00:21:16.375
known to tore the mud slides

00:21:16.441 --> 00:21:17.542
-- that affected the communities

00:21:17.609 --> 00:21:19.544
of mine a CEO and and see first

00:21:19.611 --> 00:21:22.147
hand -- how your community was

00:21:22.214 --> 00:21:24.850
impacted by this we thought

00:21:24.916 --> 00:21:26.284
that we're doing a lot of work

00:21:26.585 --> 00:21:28.086
to move our state forward and

00:21:28.153 --> 00:21:29.321
better prepare ourselves last

00:21:29.388 --> 00:21:31.089
year but this is something

00:21:31.156 --> 00:21:32.157
that we will be working on

00:21:32.224 --> 00:21:33.358
for many years to come as our

00:21:33.425 --> 00:21:34.593
communities rebuild and we

00:21:34.660 --> 00:21:36.828
protect our communities from

00:21:36.895 --> 00:21:38.764
future disaster is my hope

00:21:38.830 --> 00:21:39.665
that from the discussions that

00:21:39.731 --> 00:21:41.700
we have today we can learn

00:21:41.767 --> 00:21:43.435
ways to improve the efficiency

00:21:43.769 --> 00:21:46.505
and and -- effectiveness

00:21:46.805 --> 00:21:48.206
of our public warning system so

00:21:48.273 --> 00:21:50.509
we may mitigate the fear and

00:21:50.575 --> 00:21:52.444
loss California's face in the

00:21:52.511 --> 00:21:54.246
event of an emergency thank you

00:21:56.448 --> 00:21:57.949

00:22:06.324 --> 00:22:08.326
these events and to the

00:22:08.393 --> 00:22:09.961
process of recovery in

00:22:10.028 --> 00:22:12.898
rebuild which will go on for

00:22:14.066 --> 00:22:16.501
years to come and we're

00:22:16.568 --> 00:22:17.736
likely to see more these

00:22:17.803 --> 00:22:19.171
events going forward and will

00:22:19.571 --> 00:22:21.807
likely hear more stories -- but

00:22:21.873 --> 00:22:23.141
we're here today to try to do

00:22:23.208 --> 00:22:24.576

we're going to focus on the

00:23:29.407 --> 00:23:31.076

as possible -- so that

00:23:37.215 --> 00:23:39.951

having this conversation I'll

00:24:19.925 --> 00:24:22.194
give -- cam a basic overview

00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:23.328
I'm not gonna go into detail

00:24:23.395 --> 00:24:24.996
about the fires in specific

00:24:25.063 --> 00:24:26.798
terms just because you really

00:24:26.865 --> 00:24:28.600
have been monitoring that and

00:24:28.667 --> 00:24:29.668
the public has been monitoring

00:24:29.734 --> 00:24:30.802
that through the through the

00:24:30.869 --> 00:24:32.337
media and that is is where

00:24:32.404 --> 00:24:34.773
the best information is --

00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:36.374
but I wanted to reflect on

00:24:36.441 --> 00:24:37.676
a couple of things -- the

00:24:37.742 --> 00:24:39.411
climate is changing the fire

00:24:39.477 --> 00:24:41.746
environment is changing and

00:24:41.813 --> 00:24:43.815
we are watching that in real

00:24:43.882 --> 00:24:46.318
time -- with -- what's

00:24:46.384 --> 00:24:49.154
happening with wild fires --

00:24:49.788 --> 00:24:52.090
two thousand seventeen was

00:24:52.157 --> 00:24:54.292
the worst fire what fire season

00:24:54.359 --> 00:24:56.194
in California history up until

00:24:56.428 --> 00:24:58.897
this past month and this month

00:24:59.564 --> 00:25:02.267
and -- we did have

00:25:02.334 --> 00:25:04.469
-- earlier this year the

00:25:04.536 --> 00:25:06.638
largest fire in California

00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:08.473
history -- and Mendoza meant

00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:11.276
Mendocino county and beyond --

00:25:11.343 --> 00:25:13.511
and that we is concerning to us

00:25:13.578 --> 00:25:15.614
but that that fired in Bernie

00:25:16.448 --> 00:25:17.682
textures didn't kill anybody

00:25:19.084 --> 00:25:21.953
-- move forward to November

00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.589
and of course who we are --

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:27.325
sitting on the heels of of --

00:25:27.392 --> 00:25:29.694
the to -- fires that we're

00:25:30.295 --> 00:25:32.631
really talking about today --

00:25:32.697 --> 00:25:35.100
the campfire -- up in

00:25:35.166 --> 00:25:37.369
-- the area paradise in Butte

00:25:37.435 --> 00:25:38.870
county and then the will the

00:25:38.937 --> 00:25:41.806
fire in in started

00:25:41.873 --> 00:25:43.642
in Ventura county burned into

00:25:43.708 --> 00:25:45.944
Los Angeles county but --

00:25:46.011 --> 00:25:48.413
to very populated areas and

00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:50.248
-- what I wanted to focus on

00:25:50.315 --> 00:25:52.350
really is is what we're seeing

00:25:52.417 --> 00:25:54.686
as a as a different -- thing

00:25:54.753 --> 00:25:56.888
in in the fire environment

00:25:57.389 --> 00:25:59.357
southern California -- we

00:25:59.424 --> 00:26:01.793
are we expect fires to move

00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:04.696
miles in hours -- that's not

00:26:04.763 --> 00:26:07.299
something that's an and expected

00:26:07.365 --> 00:26:09.935
-- and we prepared for that

00:26:10.902 --> 00:26:12.971
we in the northern part

00:26:13.038 --> 00:26:14.539
of the state have prepared

00:26:14.606 --> 00:26:17.475
extensively and paradise in

00:26:17.542 --> 00:26:20.478
particular con cow and

00:26:20.545 --> 00:26:22.881
-- and Miguel yeah are are

00:26:22.948 --> 00:26:25.517
some of the most exercised in

00:26:25.850 --> 00:26:28.253
evacuation planning areas in

00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:29.421
the northern part of the state

00:26:30.088 --> 00:26:32.424
-- they are -- areas where

00:26:32.490 --> 00:26:34.292
we've had bad fires and we know

00:26:34.359 --> 00:26:36.394
that there are -- road system

00:26:36.461 --> 00:26:38.897
issues and -- we we so we

00:26:38.964 --> 00:26:41.032
plan and we have done a

00:26:41.099 --> 00:26:42.734
lot of fuels work in those

00:26:42.801 --> 00:26:45.537
in those communities and

00:26:47.205 --> 00:26:49.941
the camp fire outstripped

00:26:50.775 --> 00:26:52.811
our planning efforts in

00:26:52.877 --> 00:26:55.647
sheer time everything

00:26:55.714 --> 00:26:56.581
was everything would

00:26:56.648 --> 00:26:58.350
have gone according to

00:26:58.416 --> 00:27:01.319
our worst case estimates

00:27:02.153 --> 00:27:03.755
previous to what happened

00:27:04.889 --> 00:27:07.592
on that morning and

00:27:07.659 --> 00:27:10.462
-- so where we are

00:27:10.528 --> 00:27:12.597
is we're watching a

00:27:12.664 --> 00:27:15.100
climate that that has fire

00:27:15.166 --> 00:27:17.969
moving in miles per hour

00:27:18.503 --> 00:27:20.705
-- in the southern part of the

00:27:20.772 --> 00:27:22.340
state moving north to areas

00:27:22.407 --> 00:27:24.275
where it hasn't done that before

00:27:24.676 --> 00:27:26.945
and so -- we are re

00:27:27.012 --> 00:27:29.114
tooling our our efforts to

00:27:29.180 --> 00:27:31.883
-- to develop plans that

00:27:31.950 --> 00:27:34.252
reflect that that -- condition

00:27:34.319 --> 00:27:36.755
that we're seeing -- and

00:27:37.155 --> 00:27:40.058
-- and the need to look at

00:27:40.392 --> 00:27:41.926
everything and it's not just

00:27:41.993 --> 00:27:43.228
the whether it's not just

00:27:43.294 --> 00:27:45.597
the wind -- or the relative

00:27:45.663 --> 00:27:47.565
humidity it's it's the extent

00:27:47.632 --> 00:27:48.933
of the drought the length of

00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.403
time that fuels have been dry

00:27:51.903 --> 00:27:54.672
-- heavy fuels -- being caught

00:27:54.739 --> 00:27:57.042
up in in -- bird as burning

00:27:57.108 --> 00:27:59.444
embers in a the column and

00:27:59.511 --> 00:28:01.112
dropped miles ahead of the

00:28:01.179 --> 00:28:03.415
fire starting new fires in

00:28:03.481 --> 00:28:05.617
and around communities that

00:28:05.683 --> 00:28:07.952
trap people -- that are trying

00:28:08.019 --> 00:28:09.220
to get out in that direction

00:28:09.554 --> 00:28:10.455
these are all things that

00:28:10.522 --> 00:28:12.323
we we are going to be --

00:28:12.390 --> 00:28:14.125
working through in the fire

00:28:14.192 --> 00:28:15.727
environment and the response to

00:28:15.794 --> 00:28:18.430
fire and so --

00:28:20.799 --> 00:28:23.001
that I think in in and of itself

00:28:23.068 --> 00:28:25.637
is is the one of the biggest

00:28:25.703 --> 00:28:27.472
challenges that that the fire

00:28:27.539 --> 00:28:29.474
respond hers and and those

00:28:29.541 --> 00:28:30.842
that are doing pre fire work

00:28:30.909 --> 00:28:33.244
as we as we will be continuing

00:28:33.311 --> 00:28:35.580
under under -- funding under

00:28:35.647 --> 00:28:37.949
the nine oh one a bill and

00:28:38.016 --> 00:28:40.919
then also your bill -- senator

00:28:40.985 --> 00:28:43.021
-- twelve sixty -- those will

00:28:43.088 --> 00:28:44.756
be helping us to do more of this

00:28:44.823 --> 00:28:47.258
important work -- and we

00:28:47.325 --> 00:28:49.794
will continue -- to

00:28:49.861 --> 00:28:52.497
-- look at ways to better --

00:28:53.331 --> 00:28:55.066
land for the things that are

00:28:55.133 --> 00:28:57.068
unexpected which I have just

00:28:57.135 --> 00:28:58.970
mentioned -- I think it's

00:28:59.037 --> 00:29:01.606
important to -- add to with the

00:29:01.673 --> 00:29:04.442
the situation here -- the

00:29:04.509 --> 00:29:06.277
what happened in monosyllables

00:29:06.344 --> 00:29:08.913
was mentioned -- with the the

00:29:09.114 --> 00:29:10.748
debris flows that have followed

00:29:10.815 --> 00:29:12.250
some of these fires and and

00:29:12.317 --> 00:29:14.786
our -- watershed emergency

00:29:14.986 --> 00:29:17.589
response teams are are out on

00:29:17.655 --> 00:29:19.224
the fires and have developed

00:29:19.290 --> 00:29:21.759
plans to help with the early

00:29:21.826 --> 00:29:23.962
warning and and the development

00:29:24.028 --> 00:29:25.463
of plans to keep people out

00:29:25.530 --> 00:29:26.998
of the way when those events

00:29:27.065 --> 00:29:29.767
occur and -- I think the

00:29:29.834 --> 00:29:32.604
the public -- warning systems

00:29:32.670 --> 00:29:34.105
and the importance of those

00:29:34.539 --> 00:29:36.608
-- are going to be key moving

00:29:36.674 --> 00:29:38.510
forward in all of all of the

00:29:38.576 --> 00:29:39.444
work that we're doing pro

00:29:39.511 --> 00:29:41.279
actively and in a response

00:29:41.779 --> 00:29:44.048
-- method -- under the fire

00:29:44.115 --> 00:29:47.385
departments -- response --

00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.121
just to give get people

00:29:50.188 --> 00:29:52.223
out of the way and I think

00:29:52.724 --> 00:29:54.792
-- assembly member Limon

00:29:55.260 --> 00:29:56.327
while we're while the year

00:29:56.394 --> 00:29:57.962
coalition is growing that

00:29:58.029 --> 00:29:59.631
is important for the state

00:29:59.697 --> 00:30:01.032
of California and I believe

00:30:01.466 --> 00:30:02.367
that is where we need to

00:30:02.433 --> 00:30:04.302
be going -- as a state we

00:30:04.369 --> 00:30:05.603
need an informed public so

00:30:05.670 --> 00:30:06.804
we can keep everybody safe

00:30:07.305 --> 00:30:10.074
thank you thank you very much

00:30:12.310 --> 00:30:12.477
you

00:30:14.479 --> 00:30:16.447
will need your --

00:30:16.714 --> 00:30:19.050
right --

00:30:20.451 --> 00:30:22.620
hello yeah the

00:30:24.656 --> 00:30:27.125
maybe we might

00:30:33.131 --> 00:30:34.866
yeah your

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:37.802
yeah --

00:30:38.303 --> 00:30:40.505
my real job is to manage the up

00:30:40.572 --> 00:30:41.906
fire rescue mutual aid system

00:30:41.973 --> 00:30:43.575
for the upstate a California

00:30:44.409 --> 00:30:46.277
why I do that it's really an

00:30:46.344 --> 00:30:47.512
honor and I do it on behalf the

00:30:47.579 --> 00:30:49.647
California fire service without

00:30:49.714 --> 00:30:50.848
the California fire service

00:30:50.915 --> 00:30:51.883
without our law enforcement

00:30:51.950 --> 00:30:53.251
partners along first mutual

00:30:53.318 --> 00:30:54.419
aid written to management

00:30:54.485 --> 00:30:56.354
every other just one sector

00:30:57.222 --> 00:30:58.122
California would not have

00:30:58.189 --> 00:30:59.691
the resources to mobilize and

00:30:59.757 --> 00:31:02.694
surge when necessary for these

00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:04.062
emergencies and others that

00:31:04.128 --> 00:31:06.030
will follow I will tell you

00:31:06.097 --> 00:31:07.599
after last year and a lot of

00:31:07.665 --> 00:31:09.434
conversation -- one of the

00:31:09.500 --> 00:31:12.036
things that -- SB nine a one

00:31:12.103 --> 00:31:13.671
brought us was pre positioning

00:31:14.138 --> 00:31:15.807
-- twenty five million dollars

00:31:15.873 --> 00:31:18.076
that -- money that was put into

00:31:18.142 --> 00:31:19.978
Calaveras his budget icon as I

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:22.780
refer to my fire chief partners

00:31:22.847 --> 00:31:24.382
kind of an escrow fund we've

00:31:24.449 --> 00:31:25.550
got some premonition there and

00:31:25.617 --> 00:31:26.718
how that money can be used but

00:31:26.784 --> 00:31:28.886
I can tell you both the fires

00:31:28.953 --> 00:31:30.021
in the north and the south

00:31:30.088 --> 00:31:31.623
that -- pre positioning was

00:31:31.689 --> 00:31:34.025
actually in place -- during

00:31:34.092 --> 00:31:36.427
that time and -- it least

00:31:36.494 --> 00:31:37.395
so I can tell you both the

00:31:37.462 --> 00:31:39.464
camp in the film was a fire

00:31:39.731 --> 00:31:42.533
resources removed to assist --

00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.435
-- on those fires fairly rapidly

00:31:44.502 --> 00:31:45.803
because of that particular

00:31:45.870 --> 00:31:47.639
issue we've been working since

00:31:47.705 --> 00:31:48.940
last year with California fire

00:31:49.007 --> 00:31:50.608
chiefs California metro chiefs

00:31:50.675 --> 00:31:52.910

00:31:52.977 --> 00:31:54.445
city fire chiefs conference

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:56.080
state firefighters California

00:31:56.147 --> 00:31:57.815
professional firefighters and

00:31:57.882 --> 00:31:59.083
the Callaway as fire rescue

00:31:59.150 --> 00:32:01.319
fire scope -- border directors

00:32:01.386 --> 00:32:03.254
-- but the criterion place and

00:32:03.321 --> 00:32:05.290
continue on out of that and

00:32:05.356 --> 00:32:07.392
-- I would tell you that -- it

00:32:07.458 --> 00:32:08.860
has been an easy process to put

00:32:08.926 --> 00:32:10.695
it together but I would think

00:32:10.762 --> 00:32:12.230
-- we've got quite a bit of

00:32:12.297 --> 00:32:13.898
experience over the last the

00:32:14.265 --> 00:32:15.466
last number of months in being

00:32:15.533 --> 00:32:17.201
utilized only for fires but

00:32:17.268 --> 00:32:19.170
-- was also used in riverside

00:32:19.237 --> 00:32:20.905
county for potential my debris

00:32:20.972 --> 00:32:22.640
already and we've also stood

00:32:22.707 --> 00:32:24.375
up the will be far from Los

00:32:24.442 --> 00:32:25.777
Angeles county to assist with

00:32:25.843 --> 00:32:27.245
the with flooding and mud

00:32:27.312 --> 00:32:28.813
to breeze -- to this point

00:32:29.681 --> 00:32:32.383
nam Y. retail this --

00:32:33.685 --> 00:32:34.786
our hats really should go

00:32:34.852 --> 00:32:36.421
off to these first responders

00:32:36.487 --> 00:32:37.789
said to respond each and every

00:32:37.855 --> 00:32:40.024
day and then their ability to

00:32:40.091 --> 00:32:41.359
not only provide additional

00:32:41.426 --> 00:32:42.760
initial tack in that search

00:32:42.827 --> 00:32:44.829
capacity the goes on and on

00:32:46.030 --> 00:32:48.366
during the course of -- at least

00:32:48.433 --> 00:32:50.335
when we hit -- -- the peak and

00:32:50.401 --> 00:32:52.603
I and I would tell you that --

00:32:53.137 --> 00:32:55.306
-- reporter in our staff work

00:32:55.373 --> 00:32:57.075
extremely close together --

00:32:57.141 --> 00:32:58.943
on a day to day basis but even

00:32:59.010 --> 00:33:00.745
more closely at the exact level

00:33:00.812 --> 00:33:02.980
as -- these fires and other

00:33:03.047 --> 00:33:05.383
emergencies progressive require

00:33:05.650 --> 00:33:07.552
a real coordinated approach

00:33:07.618 --> 00:33:09.554
and we come together under what

00:33:09.620 --> 00:33:11.389
we call Usagi unified courting

00:33:11.456 --> 00:33:12.957

00:33:13.024 --> 00:33:14.292
statements are putting center

00:33:14.759 --> 00:33:15.960
to make things come together

00:33:16.361 --> 00:33:18.730
at the height we mobilize

00:33:18.796 --> 00:33:20.031

time -- at the height

00:34:19.891 --> 00:34:21.692
we put nine her nineteen engines

00:34:21.759 --> 00:34:23.060
just a mutual aid side not

two of firefighting personnel

00:34:37.408 --> 00:34:40.011
as a as things would just

00:34:40.344 --> 00:34:41.712
things would have been a almost

00:34:42.146 --> 00:34:44.715
almost should agree pops for

00:34:44.782 --> 00:34:45.883
property four hundred engines

00:34:45.950 --> 00:34:47.685
on both the walls the fire

00:34:47.752 --> 00:34:49.954
in the Compton the -- and

00:34:50.021 --> 00:34:52.423
the -- campfire in another

00:34:52.690 --> 00:34:53.958
about seventy eighty engines

00:34:54.025 --> 00:34:55.493
on the hill fire spread out

00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:56.861
those resources throughout the

00:34:56.928 --> 00:34:58.996
state war was over also all

00:34:59.063 --> 00:35:00.264
the hills resources removed

00:35:00.331 --> 00:35:02.467
over the walls the fire --

00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.502
from and then now we would at

00:35:04.569 --> 00:35:05.937
least on the campfire return are

00:35:06.003 --> 00:35:08.172
tensions as things would start

00:35:08.239 --> 00:35:10.675
to -- I look better to their

00:35:10.741 --> 00:35:12.810
search recovery probably no

00:35:12.877 --> 00:35:14.645
other time in our history on

00:35:14.712 --> 00:35:17.114
fire Los side of the house Los

00:35:17.181 --> 00:35:18.850
started out with working on the

00:35:18.916 --> 00:35:20.885
-- search recovery park for the

00:35:20.952 --> 00:35:23.654
missing personnel were quickly

00:35:23.721 --> 00:35:25.523
overwhelmed by number of task

00:35:25.590 --> 00:35:27.091
and and resources that we needed

00:35:27.625 --> 00:35:29.460
-- State Farm risky mutual aid

00:35:29.527 --> 00:35:30.628
system brought in a number of

00:35:30.695 --> 00:35:32.830
-- use our resources forever

00:35:32.897 --> 00:35:34.265
type three urban search and

00:35:34.332 --> 00:35:36.367
rescue teams an additional five

00:35:36.567 --> 00:35:37.835
regional urban search rescue

00:35:37.902 --> 00:35:39.070
team much like we did during

00:35:39.136 --> 00:35:41.072
the the -- but flows here in

00:35:41.138 --> 00:35:43.708
Santa Barbara in January --

00:35:43.774 --> 00:35:45.009
at the height in old and brought

00:35:45.076 --> 00:35:46.811
in level would call HR human

00:35:46.878 --> 00:35:48.646
remains dogs little over dished

00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.314
all three hundred firefighters

00:35:50.848 --> 00:35:52.183
so probably to heights well over

a thousand a fire law personnel

00:35:54.886 --> 00:35:56.854
working jointly together also

00:35:56.921 --> 00:35:58.456
to a point that -- stretch

00:35:58.523 --> 00:36:00.091
the limits along permits one

00:36:00.157 --> 00:36:01.959
person's capability were cal

00:36:02.026 --> 00:36:04.028
fire -- off the incident stood

00:36:04.095 --> 00:36:05.162
up and brought in additional

00:36:05.229 --> 00:36:07.164
logistical support to feed

00:36:07.231 --> 00:36:08.566
shower and take care of those

00:36:08.633 --> 00:36:10.334
personality in other site to

00:36:10.668 --> 00:36:12.069
their in Butte county again

00:36:12.136 --> 00:36:13.704
working very closely together

00:36:14.272 --> 00:36:15.573
and I would tell you that -- a

00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:16.674
lot of first you're gonna come

00:36:16.741 --> 00:36:18.709
out of this the way -- we do

00:36:18.776 --> 00:36:21.212
mapping the way we identified in

00:36:21.279 --> 00:36:23.180
search for those -- individuals

00:36:23.514 --> 00:36:25.116
-- or are going to be looked

00:36:25.182 --> 00:36:26.617
at -- and in the weeks and

00:36:26.684 --> 00:36:29.186
months to come I think that --

00:36:30.021 --> 00:36:31.656
also they should be recognize

00:36:31.722 --> 00:36:33.991
that of this is that -- station

00:36:34.058 --> 00:36:35.126
coverage specially in southern

00:36:35.192 --> 00:36:36.527
California became a significant

00:36:36.594 --> 00:36:38.696
issue Los Angeles county Los

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:41.032
Angeles city inventor a all had

00:36:41.098 --> 00:36:42.900
stations that were uncovered

00:36:42.967 --> 00:36:45.469
vacant -- is we work with our

00:36:45.536 --> 00:36:48.172
partners on the on the fires

00:36:48.506 --> 00:36:50.675
-- I would take it example is

Orange County fire authority

00:36:52.243 --> 00:36:53.844
in talking to chief Brian

00:36:53.911 --> 00:36:55.813
Fennessy was it made it was able

00:36:55.880 --> 00:36:57.315
to make additional personnel

00:36:57.381 --> 00:36:58.983

to assist and help Garbarino

00:37:00.451 --> 00:37:02.320
stations and we brought in those

00:37:02.386 --> 00:37:03.688
resources from out of state

00:37:03.754 --> 00:37:05.122
venture able release some of

00:37:05.189 --> 00:37:07.058
those resources on the incident

00:37:07.124 --> 00:37:08.192

most for firefighters today

00:37:17.134 --> 00:37:19.770
in the state is a continuing

00:37:19.837 --> 00:37:22.740
on going number of incidences

in protracted the long term

00:37:24.642 --> 00:37:26.377
these incidences are worrying

00:37:26.444 --> 00:37:28.179
upon their fatigue and their

specially -- knowing in response

00:37:38.889 --> 00:37:40.891
that -- our personal deal with

how well they do down the road

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:46.831

00:38:37.915 --> 00:38:39.483
agencies have really stepped up

00:38:39.884 --> 00:38:41.185
to work to read I think you'd

00:38:41.252 --> 00:38:42.319
go back and look probably at

00:38:42.386 --> 00:38:43.788
the height probably between

00:38:43.854 --> 00:38:45.056
north and south over three

00:38:45.122 --> 00:38:46.857
hundred thousand personnel were

00:38:46.924 --> 00:38:49.593
evacuated -- over one thousand

00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:51.028
public schools were closed

00:38:51.095 --> 00:38:52.363
it impacted more than million

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:53.698
students being displaced from

00:38:53.764 --> 00:38:55.533
north to south and I think as

00:38:55.599 --> 00:38:56.701
you're well aware some students

00:38:56.767 --> 00:38:57.835
have no schools to go back

00:38:57.902 --> 00:38:59.470
to in that long range impact

00:39:01.305 --> 00:39:02.973
I would also add that --

00:39:03.808 --> 00:39:05.076
comes down to some leadership

00:39:05.276 --> 00:39:07.044
and I would provide talked

00:39:07.111 --> 00:39:08.612
early on working through pre

00:39:08.679 --> 00:39:09.780
positioning of the fire service

00:39:09.847 --> 00:39:11.949
leadership why it hasn't been

00:39:12.016 --> 00:39:13.918
easy some days and I think

00:39:13.984 --> 00:39:15.586
-- -- triple rents and I've

00:39:15.653 --> 00:39:16.821
had a couple of very strong

00:39:16.887 --> 00:39:19.156
conversations at the end the day

00:39:19.557 --> 00:39:21.258
working together getting it done

00:39:21.325 --> 00:39:22.793
and and we kind of kind of tease

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.261
to one point mark and I did I

00:39:24.328 --> 00:39:26.097
said wow so once he should do

00:39:26.163 --> 00:39:27.431
we had no money because forces

00:39:27.498 --> 00:39:28.499
you to do more things together

00:39:28.566 --> 00:39:29.967
when you do have money but

00:39:30.034 --> 00:39:31.035
those things are going to make

00:39:31.102 --> 00:39:32.403
for a better California better

00:39:32.470 --> 00:39:34.004
response system that we do have

00:39:34.071 --> 00:39:36.574
today leadership is provided

00:39:36.640 --> 00:39:37.808
at the local level with our

00:39:37.875 --> 00:39:40.644
fire law -- emergency management

00:39:40.711 --> 00:39:42.513
side of the house been just

00:39:42.580 --> 00:39:43.614
just been really excellent

00:39:44.315 --> 00:39:45.883
one point two we brought

00:39:45.950 --> 00:39:48.285
in a type three a fire --

00:39:48.919 --> 00:39:51.422
instance fourteen to -- show

00:39:51.489 --> 00:39:54.058
up -- support to paradise

00:39:54.125 --> 00:39:56.861
city town hall -- eventually

00:39:56.927 --> 00:39:58.462
-- released and the emergency

00:39:58.529 --> 00:40:00.264
managers outside of the house

00:40:00.331 --> 00:40:01.465
able to pony up enough folks

00:40:01.532 --> 00:40:03.601
to -- -- make that get them

00:40:03.667 --> 00:40:04.835
out of there and and get the

00:40:04.902 --> 00:40:06.170
right people the right place

00:40:06.237 --> 00:40:08.105
also were good we should the

00:40:08.172 --> 00:40:09.573
state level and I think most

00:40:09.640 --> 00:40:11.408
of you seen it at around the

00:40:11.475 --> 00:40:14.078
panel is that -- at callow yes

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:17.515
cal fire CHP California

00:40:17.581 --> 00:40:19.150
National Guard leadership there

00:40:19.683 --> 00:40:21.352
they meet regularly once a month

00:40:21.418 --> 00:40:22.553
usually the fourth Thursday of

00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.854
the month for breakfast every

00:40:23.921 --> 00:40:25.456
morning there that they do

00:40:25.523 --> 00:40:28.225
that and -- they talk about

00:40:28.292 --> 00:40:30.027
ways we can do it better --

00:40:30.094 --> 00:40:31.562
we talked very frankly about

00:40:31.629 --> 00:40:32.730
things that need to get done

00:40:33.430 --> 00:40:34.398
and I think that's really

00:40:34.465 --> 00:40:35.733
important in today's day and

00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.568
age is not about who we work

00:40:37.635 --> 00:40:38.702
for its not about a political

00:40:38.769 --> 00:40:40.638
affiliation about the citizens

00:40:40.704 --> 00:40:41.639
and visitors of this great

00:40:41.705 --> 00:40:42.973
state to make things better

00:40:44.642 --> 00:40:46.710
the real fame of this -- of

00:40:47.044 --> 00:40:48.879
of today's hearing is

00:40:48.946 --> 00:40:50.514
really about communications

00:40:50.581 --> 00:40:51.549
I'll leave you with this

00:40:52.983 --> 00:40:54.185
we've talked about it we've

00:40:54.251 --> 00:40:56.287
spoken it links after last year

00:40:57.421 --> 00:40:59.557
we need a communication system

00:40:59.623 --> 00:41:01.458
not just alert warning that

00:41:01.525 --> 00:41:04.295
is resilient in reliable

00:41:04.795 --> 00:41:06.764
for only the public but Russian

00:41:06.831 --> 00:41:08.199
public service to provide

00:41:08.265 --> 00:41:10.067
critical services whether be

00:41:10.134 --> 00:41:11.902
our land mobile whether B. R.

00:41:11.969 --> 00:41:13.771
sell your would be satellite

00:41:13.838 --> 00:41:15.806
whatever it may be we need

00:41:15.873 --> 00:41:17.508
that capability each and every

00:41:17.575 --> 00:41:19.610
day especially when we loose

00:41:19.677 --> 00:41:21.846
power or news unique situation

00:41:21.912 --> 00:41:23.547
storms firestorms whatever they

00:41:23.614 --> 00:41:25.850
may be hit us that's

00:41:25.916 --> 00:41:27.184
I would leave you with today

00:41:28.986 --> 00:41:30.721
I want to thank you and -- just

00:41:30.788 --> 00:41:32.790
before we go on to Mitchell --

00:41:33.157 --> 00:41:35.025
I think that the and I think all

00:41:35.092 --> 00:41:36.827
of us who have experienced these

00:41:36.894 --> 00:41:39.597
fires -- who agreed that the

00:41:39.663 --> 00:41:41.265
that the mutual aid programs

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:43.334
the coordination that the

00:41:43.634 --> 00:41:45.536
agencies have all demonstrate

00:41:45.603 --> 00:41:47.071
together's been extraordinary

00:41:47.471 --> 00:41:48.873
I I think without question we

00:41:48.939 --> 00:41:51.542
have the finest of emergency

00:41:51.876 --> 00:41:53.777
-- systems in place of anyone

00:41:53.844 --> 00:41:56.046
in the country -- and thank

00:41:56.113 --> 00:41:57.248
you for that and I also want

00:41:57.314 --> 00:41:58.549
to mention when you talk about

00:41:58.616 --> 00:42:00.484
pre positioning I know that

00:42:00.551 --> 00:42:02.386
for the debris flows which

00:42:02.453 --> 00:42:04.889
occurred here and which could

00:42:04.955 --> 00:42:06.690
occur sure we start getting

00:42:06.757 --> 00:42:08.125
some significant rain throughout

00:42:08.192 --> 00:42:09.526
the state where those fires

00:42:09.593 --> 00:42:11.595
have completely destroyed all

00:42:11.662 --> 00:42:13.130
vegetation and created that

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:16.233
instability in the hillsides on

00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:18.269
the night of that debris flow

00:42:18.569 --> 00:42:20.137
-- I'm told over nine hundred

00:42:20.204 --> 00:42:22.106
people were saved because of

00:42:22.172 --> 00:42:23.407
pre positioning that you would

00:42:23.474 --> 00:42:24.942
Don in anticipation of that

00:42:25.009 --> 00:42:27.244
happening so -- the public I

00:42:27.311 --> 00:42:29.213
think should certainly feel

00:42:29.546 --> 00:42:31.415
reassured that the the best

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:33.150
that can be done is being done

00:42:33.217 --> 00:42:34.652
in terms of these kinds of life

00:42:34.718 --> 00:42:36.854
saving efforts by our first

00:42:36.921 --> 00:42:38.656
responders and I think we all

00:42:38.722 --> 00:42:40.925
share in our appreciation for

00:42:40.991 --> 00:42:42.993
that and of course going forward

00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:44.828
there is much more than the

00:42:44.895 --> 00:42:46.764
we need to do is these events

00:42:46.830 --> 00:42:48.866
become more more dramatic --

00:42:48.933 --> 00:42:50.234
you did mention something it's

00:42:50.301 --> 00:42:52.002
not really on the agenda for

00:42:52.069 --> 00:42:53.370
today but I think we're all

00:42:53.437 --> 00:42:55.205
concerned about is the impacts

00:42:55.272 --> 00:42:56.840
that these events are having

00:42:56.907 --> 00:42:58.642
on our first responders whether

00:42:58.709 --> 00:43:00.711
it's their mental health -- we

00:43:00.778 --> 00:43:02.947
know we're seeing a ordinary

00:43:03.013 --> 00:43:05.482
and an unusual number of --

00:43:05.549 --> 00:43:07.952
first responders having serious

00:43:08.018 --> 00:43:09.253
mental health issues leading

00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.255
in some instances the suicides

00:43:11.789 --> 00:43:13.524
-- also the fact that there's

00:43:13.590 --> 00:43:15.259
no recovery time or training

00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:17.061
time for this new abnormal

00:43:17.127 --> 00:43:18.362
that were having to deal with

00:43:18.429 --> 00:43:19.964
so I hope that we will take

00:43:20.030 --> 00:43:23.167
that into account but the costs

00:43:23.233 --> 00:43:25.069
just the monetary cost the cost

00:43:25.135 --> 00:43:26.804
to our children and the lack of

00:43:26.870 --> 00:43:28.272
opportunity to continue their

00:43:28.339 --> 00:43:30.107
education businesses that are

00:43:30.174 --> 00:43:31.709
losing their businesses homes

00:43:31.775 --> 00:43:32.977
people losing their homes their

00:43:33.043 --> 00:43:34.712
valuables their sense of hope

00:43:35.179 --> 00:43:37.715
-- and security I think are

00:43:37.781 --> 00:43:39.149
all things that is who we are

00:43:39.216 --> 00:43:40.484
going for we're going to have

00:43:40.551 --> 00:43:43.220
to recognize and try to address

00:43:43.487 --> 00:43:44.555
that certainly the work that's

00:43:44.621 --> 00:43:46.357
been done -- and I'm sure

00:43:46.423 --> 00:43:47.725
with all these fires the fact

00:43:47.791 --> 00:43:49.426
that the will see fire we did

00:43:49.493 --> 00:43:50.928
have three fatalities but when

00:43:50.995 --> 00:43:52.930
you look at the extent of the

00:43:52.997 --> 00:43:55.566
damages many of us have -- I

00:43:55.632 --> 00:43:57.568
just driving up to one a one

00:43:57.634 --> 00:43:59.770
yesterday sing in Calabasas

00:43:59.837 --> 00:44:01.105
and gore and a jump eight

00:44:01.171 --> 00:44:03.007
lanes of freeway and just I

00:44:03.073 --> 00:44:04.575
know in Malibu similar things

00:44:04.875 --> 00:44:05.943
the fact that there were three

00:44:06.010 --> 00:44:08.078
dances is tragic there could

00:44:08.145 --> 00:44:10.447
have been so many more -- and

00:44:10.514 --> 00:44:12.516
-- and while we mourn every

00:44:12.583 --> 00:44:13.817
one of those people we have

00:44:13.884 --> 00:44:16.153
to recognize that -- the work

00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:18.155
that's being done has been --

00:44:18.455 --> 00:44:20.591
extraordinary so I wanted to

00:44:20.657 --> 00:44:23.327
-- least sure my observation

00:44:23.394 --> 00:44:25.496
and thank you all for the

00:44:26.163 --> 00:44:27.598
next where we are now going

00:44:27.664 --> 00:44:30.367
to focus in on the emergency

00:44:30.434 --> 00:44:32.236
notification issuing thank

will give us an overview of

00:44:47.017 --> 00:44:48.952
the recent changes to state law

00:44:49.153 --> 00:44:51.388
governing emergency notification

00:44:51.655 --> 00:44:53.424

seriously and we appreciate

-- three of the seven

00:45:17.514 --> 00:45:18.415
largest wildfires in

00:45:18.482 --> 00:45:19.716
California's history happen in

00:45:19.783 --> 00:45:21.885
less than a year and as you just

00:45:21.952 --> 00:45:23.320
heard from the chief Porter and

00:45:23.387 --> 00:45:25.255
she secures on the most LA as

00:45:25.322 --> 00:45:27.925
far the campfire -- into county

00:45:27.991 --> 00:45:29.660
was -- finally contain this --

00:45:29.726 --> 00:45:31.895
this last Sunday and if

00:45:31.962 --> 00:45:33.197
you look back just in the last

00:45:33.263 --> 00:45:35.232
year in two thousand seventeen

00:45:35.299 --> 00:45:36.700
we had all fifty eight counties

00:45:36.767 --> 00:45:38.102
for included in the federal

00:45:38.168 --> 00:45:39.970
major disaster declaration

00:45:40.037 --> 00:45:40.971
you for either the winter

00:45:41.038 --> 00:45:42.940
storm or the catastrophic wild

00:45:43.006 --> 00:45:45.542
fire incidents so this is not

00:45:45.609 --> 00:45:47.010
isolated in his individual

00:45:47.077 --> 00:45:48.612
area everybody's impacted in

00:45:48.679 --> 00:45:51.748
California not as a result

00:45:51.815 --> 00:45:53.250
of those wild fire impacts many

00:45:53.317 --> 00:45:54.118
bills were introduced to the

00:45:54.184 --> 00:45:55.886
legislature -- in there are

00:45:55.953 --> 00:45:57.187
some specific bills that dealt

00:45:57.254 --> 00:45:58.956
primarily with a notification

00:45:59.022 --> 00:46:00.090
public safety communications

00:46:00.157 --> 00:46:00.824
and so I want to give you a

00:46:00.891 --> 00:46:02.192
follow up on where we stay

00:46:02.459 --> 00:46:04.261
stand on those -- those bills

00:46:05.729 --> 00:46:06.997
Senate bill eight thirty three a

00:46:07.064 --> 00:46:09.366
month -- from center require --

00:46:09.433 --> 00:46:10.501
which should required Callaway

00:46:10.567 --> 00:46:13.203
yes -- before this coming July

00:46:13.470 --> 00:46:14.905
first in two thousand nineteen

00:46:15.239 --> 00:46:17.107
-- to develop a statewide alert

00:46:17.174 --> 00:46:18.809
and warning god lot guidelines

00:46:19.109 --> 00:46:21.445
and best practices --

00:46:22.279 --> 00:46:24.047
those that we've been working

00:46:24.114 --> 00:46:25.916
on that extensively at this time

00:46:25.983 --> 00:46:28.352
there's been a series of of

00:46:28.418 --> 00:46:30.721
meetings -- at the local level

00:46:30.787 --> 00:46:32.055
with all of our local partners

00:46:32.122 --> 00:46:33.891
-- we have a technical advisory

00:46:33.957 --> 00:46:35.759
group -- that we as part of

00:46:35.826 --> 00:46:37.127
the -- state emerge management

00:46:37.194 --> 00:46:38.228
system that has been addressing

00:46:38.295 --> 00:46:39.429
this and they're gonna be

00:46:39.496 --> 00:46:40.564
presenting that information

00:46:40.631 --> 00:46:42.399
to the advisory board its

00:46:42.466 --> 00:46:45.135
next upcoming meeting assembly

00:46:45.202 --> 00:46:47.237
twenty one -- for -- center

00:46:47.304 --> 00:46:49.806
Jackson really was going to is

00:46:49.873 --> 00:46:52.342
going to change the the made

00:46:52.409 --> 00:46:53.911
the nature how we doing business

00:46:53.977 --> 00:46:55.679
it's taking us from an opt out

00:46:56.213 --> 00:46:57.748
-- to an opt out verses an opt

00:46:57.814 --> 00:46:59.516
in requirement by using the

00:46:59.583 --> 00:47:00.918
utility information that's out

00:47:00.984 --> 00:47:03.187
there -- I've seen that -- we

00:47:03.253 --> 00:47:04.988
have our colleague -- -- Jeff

00:47:05.055 --> 00:47:07.157
Norris from San Matteo on the

00:47:07.224 --> 00:47:09.026
agenda today which is great

00:47:09.092 --> 00:47:10.594
because a San Matteo is our is

00:47:10.661 --> 00:47:12.896
our first adopter -- of that

00:47:12.963 --> 00:47:14.364
system and and taking advantage

00:47:14.431 --> 00:47:16.500
of that and the lessons learned

00:47:16.800 --> 00:47:18.569
-- from San Matteo will be

00:47:18.635 --> 00:47:20.637
-- excellent to share with

00:47:20.704 --> 00:47:22.139
our at the county partners

00:47:22.739 --> 00:47:25.342
-- some of the late eighteen

00:47:25.409 --> 00:47:27.277
seventy seven -- from

00:47:27.711 --> 00:47:30.080
-- member the mon -- which

00:47:30.147 --> 00:47:32.316
said in as is focused primarily

00:47:32.382 --> 00:47:33.850
on translation of services in

00:47:33.917 --> 00:47:35.485
transition styles and guides

00:47:35.819 --> 00:47:36.720
and we're working on that as

00:47:36.787 --> 00:47:38.522
well and that is continue to

00:47:38.589 --> 00:47:40.824
move forward and then the

00:47:41.225 --> 00:47:42.159
assembly bill eighteen thirty

00:47:42.226 --> 00:47:43.527
six Senate bill eight seventy

00:47:43.594 --> 00:47:44.861
last year was on the docket

00:47:45.128 --> 00:47:46.129
which was going to restructure

00:47:46.196 --> 00:47:47.965
funding for the nine one one

00:47:48.031 --> 00:47:50.767
system -- to push us into

00:47:50.834 --> 00:47:52.502
-- next generation and one one

00:47:53.103 --> 00:47:55.572
-- on September twenty first

00:47:55.639 --> 00:47:56.406
the governor signed eight

00:47:56.473 --> 00:47:58.041
thirty three a twenty one in

00:47:58.108 --> 00:47:59.176
eighteen seventy seven and

00:47:59.243 --> 00:48:01.111
however was unfortunate that --

00:48:01.678 --> 00:48:03.714
-- eighteen thirty six or

00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:04.715
eight seventy was refuse

00:48:04.781 --> 00:48:06.183
passage about the legislature

00:48:06.250 --> 00:48:07.951
did a person politics during

00:48:08.018 --> 00:48:09.987
election year and it's

00:48:10.053 --> 00:48:12.689
important because as Kim said

00:48:12.756 --> 00:48:14.291
Rick resiliency redundancy

00:48:14.358 --> 00:48:15.525
of our communication systems

00:48:15.592 --> 00:48:17.494
it all ties together through

00:48:17.761 --> 00:48:19.596
alert and warning through nine

00:48:19.663 --> 00:48:22.099
one one and -- obviously

00:48:22.165 --> 00:48:24.268
through the -- public radio

00:48:24.334 --> 00:48:25.235
side of the house that we

00:48:25.302 --> 00:48:26.903
work on so this this it's a

00:48:26.970 --> 00:48:29.239
holistic nexus of inclusion

00:48:29.306 --> 00:48:31.275
with an entire -- network of

00:48:31.341 --> 00:48:33.477
of that communications for us

00:48:37.481 --> 00:48:38.915
so one of things I wanted to

00:48:38.982 --> 00:48:40.183
highlight the today is that

00:48:40.651 --> 00:48:42.319
-- as part of a response

00:48:42.386 --> 00:48:43.920
recovery -- ensuring that

00:48:43.987 --> 00:48:45.489
local government government

00:48:45.555 --> 00:48:47.724
maintains their responsibility

00:48:47.791 --> 00:48:49.359
for merging notification

00:48:49.426 --> 00:48:50.727
and communication incident

00:48:50.794 --> 00:48:52.329
management is critical in key

00:48:52.396 --> 00:48:53.530
to this and which is why we work

00:48:53.597 --> 00:48:54.931
so closely with our partners

00:48:55.165 --> 00:48:57.334
at the local level -- they

00:48:57.401 --> 00:48:58.568
generally have the most accurate

00:48:58.635 --> 00:49:00.837
information -- they understand

00:49:00.904 --> 00:49:02.139
the immediate situation they

00:49:02.205 --> 00:49:03.140
have knowledge of both the

00:49:03.206 --> 00:49:05.475
potential impacts and wear

00:49:05.542 --> 00:49:06.710
protective measures are going

00:49:06.777 --> 00:49:08.979
to work or not work so that

00:49:09.046 --> 00:49:11.415
role -- their role in their

00:49:11.481 --> 00:49:13.450
maintaining their leadership out

00:49:13.517 --> 00:49:15.852
at the local level is the basis

00:49:15.919 --> 00:49:17.087
of our standardized emergency

00:49:17.154 --> 00:49:18.188
management system you'll hear

00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:20.757
their term Sims use regularly

00:49:21.058 --> 00:49:23.727
and -- it's critical for

00:49:23.794 --> 00:49:25.362
the for them -- to be in that

00:49:25.429 --> 00:49:26.997
lead and the state and the

00:49:27.064 --> 00:49:27.931
federal government come in

00:49:27.998 --> 00:49:29.700
support them in those efforts

00:49:31.768 --> 00:49:33.937
as a previous stated on --

00:49:34.004 --> 00:49:35.005
Senate bill eight thirty three

00:49:35.072 --> 00:49:36.373
on a late morning guidelines

00:49:36.440 --> 00:49:38.642
-- where we sit now --

00:49:39.509 --> 00:49:40.444
those guidelines have been

00:49:40.510 --> 00:49:42.212
drafted they're gonna cover

00:49:42.279 --> 00:49:44.047
the timeline for sending alerts

00:49:44.247 --> 00:49:46.283
we're gonna cover -- best

00:49:46.350 --> 00:49:47.651
practices for sending advance

00:49:47.718 --> 00:49:49.553
warning impending threats a

00:49:49.619 --> 00:49:50.987
best practices for testing and

00:49:51.054 --> 00:49:52.756
training and exercising at the

00:49:53.090 --> 00:49:54.825
at the city and county level

00:49:55.125 --> 00:49:57.561
of their warning systems --

00:49:58.228 --> 00:50:00.597
protocols for redundancy --

00:50:00.664 --> 00:50:02.165
how to do staffing patterns

00:50:02.232 --> 00:50:03.066
-- to ensure that you have

00:50:03.133 --> 00:50:04.634
trained operators to to provide

00:50:04.701 --> 00:50:06.203
those alerts at all times

00:50:07.104 --> 00:50:09.106
-- practices for best practices

00:50:09.172 --> 00:50:10.407
for affected notifications for

00:50:10.474 --> 00:50:11.575
the axis and functional needs

00:50:11.641 --> 00:50:13.210
community and really developing

00:50:13.276 --> 00:50:14.411
the message templates that we

00:50:14.478 --> 00:50:16.446
need to have in place for common

00:50:16.513 --> 00:50:18.915
terminology roles

00:50:18.982 --> 00:50:20.851
responsibilities for alerting

00:50:21.184 --> 00:50:22.919
authorities -- has to be

00:50:22.986 --> 00:50:24.454
completely vetted and and well

00:50:24.521 --> 00:50:25.722
developed and then the course

00:50:25.789 --> 00:50:26.957
the technologies available to

00:50:27.023 --> 00:50:29.459
send those alerts -- for us

00:50:30.093 --> 00:50:32.629
so -- we anticipate that

00:50:32.696 --> 00:50:34.865
guideline going for the what

00:50:34.931 --> 00:50:36.400
we taking from the technical

00:50:36.466 --> 00:50:38.135
subgroup to the advisory

00:50:38.201 --> 00:50:39.269
board which is that thirty

00:50:39.336 --> 00:50:40.904
member of state accounting

00:50:40.971 --> 00:50:42.639
and and and local membership

00:50:42.706 --> 00:50:43.907
and then if they get full

00:50:43.974 --> 00:50:45.242
adoption and will be able

00:50:45.308 --> 00:50:46.476
to publish those guidelines

00:50:46.543 --> 00:50:48.645
here are in relatively soon

00:50:50.614 --> 00:50:52.749
-- for Sandali twenty one

00:50:52.816 --> 00:50:54.651
-- that tool -- for local

00:50:54.718 --> 00:50:56.853
jurisdictions -- -- we're we're

00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:58.488
anxious to see that I get a

00:50:58.555 --> 00:51:01.057
greater put greater -- use

00:51:01.291 --> 00:51:03.894
and and really -- the counties

00:51:03.960 --> 00:51:05.228
of feeling more comfortable

00:51:05.295 --> 00:51:06.329
for the implementation and

00:51:06.396 --> 00:51:07.297
that's why I think assembly

00:51:07.364 --> 00:51:08.999
tales -- comments here today

00:51:09.065 --> 00:51:11.234
we're gonna be so good and

00:51:11.301 --> 00:51:13.003
then for the translation --

00:51:13.069 --> 00:51:14.838
set household member them on

00:51:15.138 --> 00:51:16.573
that is working right now --

00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:17.741
we expect that to be completed

00:51:17.808 --> 00:51:18.909
in have that in place by the

00:51:18.975 --> 00:51:20.510
summer of nineteen so three

00:51:20.577 --> 00:51:21.778
great bills that were looking

00:51:21.845 --> 00:51:24.147
forward to seeing -- moving

00:51:24.214 --> 00:51:25.715
forward and really getting

00:51:25.782 --> 00:51:27.384
good implementation -- through

00:51:27.451 --> 00:51:29.119
all of our our local and --

00:51:29.186 --> 00:51:31.321
partners -- this is the year of

00:51:31.388 --> 00:51:33.557
implementation for those and we

00:51:33.623 --> 00:51:35.358
look forward to working together

00:51:35.425 --> 00:51:37.093
with the -- you on any future

00:51:37.160 --> 00:51:38.128
and needs that we may have

00:51:40.030 --> 00:51:42.265
thank you thank you -- I have

00:51:42.332 --> 00:51:43.600
couple questions and then I'll

00:51:43.667 --> 00:51:45.535
put it up for other questions

00:51:45.869 --> 00:51:47.737
-- for you Mitch just a couple

00:51:48.038 --> 00:51:50.106
-- what is -- yes doing to help

00:51:50.173 --> 00:51:51.808
local jurisdictions implement

00:51:51.875 --> 00:51:54.010
these bills and -- are you

00:51:54.077 --> 00:51:55.712
considering -- crafting an

00:51:55.779 --> 00:51:57.681
implementation plan with things

00:51:57.747 --> 00:51:59.316
like a model memoranda of

00:51:59.382 --> 00:52:01.785
understandings among public

00:52:01.852 --> 00:52:03.854
and private sector stakeholders

00:52:06.289 --> 00:52:08.024
yeah are a local partners are

00:52:08.091 --> 00:52:09.359
obviously the critical component

00:52:09.426 --> 00:52:10.861
to this and that's why it's --

00:52:10.927 --> 00:52:12.996
it's great to see the -- the

00:52:13.063 --> 00:52:13.964
members that are on your next

00:52:14.030 --> 00:52:15.265
steps and then future panel

00:52:15.332 --> 00:52:17.167
we have here and they have to

00:52:17.234 --> 00:52:19.202
have that by in a for anything

00:52:19.269 --> 00:52:20.370
that we're going to push and

00:52:20.437 --> 00:52:21.671
and develop together so we've

00:52:21.738 --> 00:52:23.006
been jointly meeting with them

00:52:23.340 --> 00:52:24.508
at this time we continue to

00:52:24.574 --> 00:52:26.343
meet with them we draft up

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:28.078
-- -- guidance in the we have

00:52:28.144 --> 00:52:29.179
them to come back and ask them

00:52:29.246 --> 00:52:30.480
to tell us where we're offer

00:52:30.547 --> 00:52:32.616
we're wrong where we we think

00:52:32.682 --> 00:52:34.451
-- -- that we can do better

00:52:34.518 --> 00:52:35.619
and so we continue to meet

00:52:35.685 --> 00:52:37.087
on a regular basis with that

00:52:37.153 --> 00:52:39.022
with those members -- to try

00:52:39.089 --> 00:52:40.524
to crafting develop the best

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:42.759
-- -- guidance that we're

00:52:42.826 --> 00:52:44.227
gonna have Ford and continue

00:52:44.294 --> 00:52:46.196
prudent in is your timeline

00:52:46.263 --> 00:52:48.798
for -- -- pushing this to

00:52:48.865 --> 00:52:51.034
local emergency -- managers

00:52:54.804 --> 00:52:56.907
prior to this -- unfortunately

00:52:56.973 --> 00:52:58.608
Ted the so recent events that

00:52:58.675 --> 00:53:00.110
-- has kind of consumed a lot of

00:53:00.176 --> 00:53:01.878
our time -- between the of the

00:53:01.945 --> 00:53:03.613
hill will see and and campfires

00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:05.515
-- our time when was this this

00:53:05.582 --> 00:53:06.816
December we were intending to

00:53:06.883 --> 00:53:08.385
have this -- pushed out at the

00:53:08.451 --> 00:53:09.953
next assumes advisory group

00:53:10.287 --> 00:53:11.388
on that may shift a little bit

00:53:11.454 --> 00:53:12.789
force based on time lines and

00:53:12.856 --> 00:53:14.157
then finally hopefully getting

00:53:14.224 --> 00:53:15.225
into the holidays and giving

00:53:15.292 --> 00:53:16.326
some folks a little bit time

00:53:16.393 --> 00:53:18.762
off but -- we're very close to

00:53:19.162 --> 00:53:20.697
being able to push a definitive

00:53:20.764 --> 00:53:21.965
guidelines now I've seen the

00:53:22.032 --> 00:53:23.934
draft -- and we just need to

00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:25.068
make sure that we have complete

00:53:25.135 --> 00:53:26.570
by and from all the stakeholders

00:53:26.636 --> 00:53:27.938
and weeks we can push that out

00:53:28.405 --> 00:53:29.339
-- and then the translation

00:53:29.406 --> 00:53:31.207
services -- our target is the

00:53:31.274 --> 00:53:32.776
summer of nineteen -- to have

00:53:32.842 --> 00:53:34.444
that in place one of the things

00:53:34.511 --> 00:53:35.612
you mentioned I think we all

00:53:35.679 --> 00:53:37.247
agree is that there has to be

00:53:37.614 --> 00:53:39.583
-- not only by and from the look

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:40.917
from each of the fifty eight

00:53:40.984 --> 00:53:42.719
counties but that they have to

00:53:42.786 --> 00:53:44.955
take leadership in this -- are

00:53:45.021 --> 00:53:47.591
you -- seeing that happening are

00:53:47.657 --> 00:53:50.093
weak it has there been --

00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:52.696
full cooperation and enthusiasm

00:53:52.762 --> 00:53:54.531
my guess is a good word from

00:53:54.731 --> 00:53:56.199
from all of our counties

00:53:58.468 --> 00:54:00.637
so I would say that -- were

00:54:00.704 --> 00:54:02.339
fortunate that we have are

00:54:02.405 --> 00:54:04.674
now at the state -- forty

00:54:04.741 --> 00:54:06.076
five that I'm tracking forty

00:54:06.142 --> 00:54:07.744
five counties -- and their

00:54:07.811 --> 00:54:09.679
representation of fifty eight

00:54:09.746 --> 00:54:10.680
that are actually signed

00:54:10.747 --> 00:54:12.349
up within the op I pause a

00:54:12.415 --> 00:54:13.783
community that gives them the

00:54:13.850 --> 00:54:15.885
ability to access emergency

00:54:15.952 --> 00:54:18.154
alert systems and send --

00:54:18.221 --> 00:54:19.856
wireless emergency alerts -- for

00:54:19.923 --> 00:54:21.658
example nay may also have local

00:54:21.925 --> 00:54:23.393
offices so there's still some

00:54:23.460 --> 00:54:25.862
room to to do better -- to grow

00:54:25.929 --> 00:54:28.031
-- but more fortunate that we

00:54:28.098 --> 00:54:30.533
have a better job Xin I use

00:54:31.034 --> 00:54:31.968
I would say that Lake County

00:54:32.035 --> 00:54:33.503
is probably our best example

00:54:33.570 --> 00:54:35.071
we saw them in two thousand and

00:54:35.138 --> 00:54:37.073
and fifteen -- struggle with

00:54:37.140 --> 00:54:39.275
alert warning -- when their face

00:54:39.342 --> 00:54:40.910
the vents and by two thousand

00:54:40.977 --> 00:54:44.147
seventeen -- they were -- the

00:54:44.214 --> 00:54:46.349
the absolute example of success

00:54:46.416 --> 00:54:48.785
-- they they used every form

00:54:49.052 --> 00:54:50.920
of alert warning on the two

00:54:50.987 --> 00:54:52.522
thousand seventeen fire that --

00:54:52.589 --> 00:54:53.690
that struck in in neighboring

00:54:53.757 --> 00:54:55.725
to them they use their their

00:54:55.792 --> 00:54:56.893
men she alert system for the

00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.695
broadcast side they used it for

00:54:58.995 --> 00:55:00.063
wireless emergency alerts to

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.364
use their own social media and

00:55:01.431 --> 00:55:03.767
their own local platform so --

00:55:04.367 --> 00:55:06.770
we know that through practice

00:55:06.836 --> 00:55:08.438
and through good development --

00:55:08.505 --> 00:55:09.673
you can have a good program in

00:55:09.739 --> 00:55:11.241
place and and I think they're a

00:55:11.307 --> 00:55:12.742
good example of of what you can

00:55:12.809 --> 00:55:15.311
see I would add

00:55:15.378 --> 00:55:16.946
that -- sure Martin's not a

00:55:17.013 --> 00:55:19.249
larger operation he's at the

00:55:19.315 --> 00:55:21.918
smaller county and -- he fights

00:55:21.985 --> 00:55:24.621
-- a number of vacancies -- --

00:55:24.688 --> 00:55:26.089
to staff in his own operation

00:55:26.156 --> 00:55:27.891
everyday but they are really

00:55:27.957 --> 00:55:30.326
good example of what can be done

00:55:30.393 --> 00:55:32.228
and how it can be done the other

00:55:32.295 --> 00:55:33.096
day it's gonna come down the

00:55:33.163 --> 00:55:35.498
locals doing it emerges camp

00:55:35.565 --> 00:55:37.133
to continue to work together

00:55:37.834 --> 00:55:39.302
at the state and local level to

00:55:39.369 --> 00:55:41.504
make it come together is there

00:55:41.571 --> 00:55:43.206
a you know we do I think all

00:55:43.273 --> 00:55:45.508
agree that the counties need to

00:55:45.575 --> 00:55:46.810
take the lead but if you only

00:55:46.876 --> 00:55:48.411
a forty five and fifty eight

00:55:48.478 --> 00:55:51.047
that still thirteen counties

00:55:51.114 --> 00:55:52.716
that are not participating

00:55:53.283 --> 00:55:55.685
-- their communities are gonna

00:55:55.752 --> 00:55:57.754
be pretty upset if they don't

00:55:57.821 --> 00:55:59.556
get the kinds of warnings that

00:55:59.622 --> 00:56:01.157
might otherwise be available so

00:56:01.224 --> 00:56:03.159
perhaps offline or at some point

00:56:03.560 --> 00:56:05.095
we can have that conversation

00:56:05.161 --> 00:56:07.197
because we really do want to

00:56:07.263 --> 00:56:08.665
counties to take ownership

00:56:08.732 --> 00:56:09.766
but if they're not willing to

00:56:09.833 --> 00:56:11.301
do that that that presents a

00:56:11.367 --> 00:56:13.937
challenge and -- if you have

00:56:14.003 --> 00:56:14.971
a thought on that mental

00:56:15.038 --> 00:56:16.372
opening up to the questions

00:56:17.674 --> 00:56:19.709
yes and and we agree -- and

00:56:19.776 --> 00:56:21.077
we're also getting more and

00:56:21.144 --> 00:56:22.746
greater fidelity every day on

00:56:22.812 --> 00:56:23.880
-- every city because there

00:56:23.947 --> 00:56:25.115
are some cities within those

00:56:25.181 --> 00:56:26.416
counties that have adopted so

00:56:26.483 --> 00:56:28.451
you see -- they have certain

00:56:28.518 --> 00:56:29.819
and programs in place but

00:56:29.886 --> 00:56:31.121
I want to give you a county

00:56:31.187 --> 00:56:32.922
wide kind of implementation

00:56:32.989 --> 00:56:33.857
level so you can see for

00:56:33.923 --> 00:56:35.925
that's a thinking questions

00:56:38.628 --> 00:56:40.630
thank you at there were

00:56:41.264 --> 00:56:42.899
a few elements that were

00:56:42.966 --> 00:56:44.634
mentioned in this particular

00:56:44.701 --> 00:56:47.070
discussion that probably could

00:56:47.137 --> 00:56:49.672
have their own -- hearing

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:51.574
-- but at but I did want to

00:56:51.641 --> 00:56:53.576
touch on a couple of them

00:56:53.643 --> 00:56:54.511
particularly because that we

00:56:54.577 --> 00:56:55.879
have you here as panelists

00:56:55.945 --> 00:56:58.014
now and to give us feedback

00:56:58.081 --> 00:57:00.216
on -- perhaps direction the

00:57:00.283 --> 00:57:01.618
legislature should be thinking

00:57:01.684 --> 00:57:03.653
about the elements that to

00:57:04.254 --> 00:57:05.889
a a wanted to touch on it

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:08.391
were related to mapping and

00:57:08.458 --> 00:57:10.727
search of the missing --

00:57:10.794 --> 00:57:11.961
the other one you mentioned

00:57:12.028 --> 00:57:14.731
station coverage I and

00:57:14.798 --> 00:57:17.167
how we we think about that

00:57:17.534 --> 00:57:19.269
-- in the last one is a

00:57:19.335 --> 00:57:21.805
conversation that I know has

00:57:21.871 --> 00:57:23.106
been happening and assembly

00:57:23.173 --> 00:57:24.474
member Jim wood around a bill

00:57:24.541 --> 00:57:26.476
this year related to schools

00:57:26.976 --> 00:57:29.445
-- but when we have a million

00:57:29.512 --> 00:57:30.580
students in the state of

00:57:30.647 --> 00:57:33.950
California missing schools and

00:57:34.017 --> 00:57:36.352
several who are who no longer

00:57:36.419 --> 00:57:37.887
have a school to go back to

00:57:38.354 --> 00:57:40.890
-- it certainly is a different

00:57:40.957 --> 00:57:43.226
conversation to have I know

00:57:43.293 --> 00:57:45.795
that California's it new

00:57:45.862 --> 00:57:47.030
superintendent of public

00:57:47.096 --> 00:57:49.199
instruction the lacked -- has

00:57:49.265 --> 00:57:51.301
had conversations -- at least

00:57:51.367 --> 00:57:54.137
with us a few of us at here

00:57:54.204 --> 00:57:56.439
about what needs to happen

00:57:56.506 --> 00:57:57.974
but if there are any thoughts

00:57:58.041 --> 00:57:59.108
or direction that you can

00:57:59.175 --> 00:58:00.577
provide on those three

00:58:00.877 --> 00:58:03.179
elements -- certainly they

00:58:03.246 --> 00:58:05.715
require their own hearing but

00:58:05.982 --> 00:58:07.517
it would be helpful to hear

00:58:10.320 --> 00:58:12.288
the sun mapping for them such

00:58:12.355 --> 00:58:14.290
a further search recovery

00:58:14.357 --> 00:58:17.227
standpoint again I think that

00:58:17.293 --> 00:58:19.996
-- we have a night

00:58:20.063 --> 00:58:21.731
in areas largest paradise

00:58:22.632 --> 00:58:24.434
and con cal and even parts

00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:25.535
Miguel you that had to be

00:58:25.602 --> 00:58:28.238
covered I think that -- it's

00:58:28.304 --> 00:58:29.939
it's a pretty daunting task so

00:58:30.006 --> 00:58:32.442
-- -- bringing

00:58:32.508 --> 00:58:33.509
together the world in search and

00:58:33.576 --> 00:58:35.111
rescue site from law enforcement

00:58:35.178 --> 00:58:36.312
and then the urban search rescue

00:58:36.379 --> 00:58:38.615
side I think up different ways

00:58:38.681 --> 00:58:39.916
to approach how to do things

00:58:40.216 --> 00:58:41.918
but in the end the day we did

00:58:42.151 --> 00:58:44.020
it did come together mapping

00:58:44.087 --> 00:58:45.922
was brought in because of the

00:58:45.989 --> 00:58:47.724
the the share responsibility

00:58:48.057 --> 00:58:48.958
I think what you're gonna see

00:58:49.025 --> 00:58:50.994
firewall will sit down after

00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:53.329
this talk about best practices

00:58:53.529 --> 00:58:54.764
income together you know we

00:58:54.831 --> 00:58:56.532
we've got great technology and

00:58:56.599 --> 00:58:57.433
I mean that whole heartedly

00:58:57.500 --> 00:58:59.168
with with some of the mapping

00:58:59.235 --> 00:59:01.170
it's done on a day to day basis

00:59:01.604 --> 00:59:03.573
so I I think it's again just

00:59:03.640 --> 00:59:05.375
working together to to look at

00:59:05.441 --> 00:59:07.310
the lessons learned a because

00:59:07.377 --> 00:59:09.178
the next go around -- whatever

00:59:09.245 --> 00:59:10.346
the next event will be the

00:59:10.413 --> 00:59:12.348
fifth larger -- maybe it's the

00:59:12.415 --> 00:59:13.716
major earthquake we're still

00:59:13.783 --> 00:59:15.518
gonna have to work through some

00:59:15.585 --> 00:59:16.753
of this down the road so I I

00:59:16.819 --> 00:59:18.755
feel pretty confident from that

00:59:18.821 --> 00:59:21.357
side of it -- Leeson mapping

00:59:21.691 --> 00:59:23.526
side of where we're going and

00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:26.162
I think that -- CalPERS

00:59:26.229 --> 00:59:27.597
incident management team working

00:59:27.664 --> 00:59:29.032
with the urban search and rescue

00:59:29.365 --> 00:59:30.700
-- side of the house working

00:59:30.767 --> 00:59:32.302
long person was able to that

00:59:32.735 --> 00:59:33.803
what we really need to do like

00:59:33.870 --> 00:59:34.938
to about everything we do in

00:59:35.004 --> 00:59:36.940
today's day and age it's about

00:59:37.006 --> 00:59:39.742
having programs that are not

00:59:39.809 --> 00:59:42.111
proprietary but were how we can

00:59:42.178 --> 00:59:44.447
actually interchange information

00:59:44.514 --> 00:59:46.582
no matter what we're doing --

00:59:46.649 --> 00:59:47.917
to make it easier to bring it

00:59:47.984 --> 00:59:50.186
together and some a technology

00:59:50.253 --> 00:59:51.554
some interest sophistication

00:59:51.621 --> 00:59:53.389
of it but I think if you were

00:59:53.456 --> 00:59:54.891
at the infinite base you would

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:57.393
see -- just some of the great

00:59:57.460 --> 00:59:58.995
work that was done by firing a

00:59:59.062 --> 01:00:00.163
lot to get to this point where

01:00:00.229 --> 01:00:02.198
we're at today Blair said going

01:00:02.265 --> 01:00:03.733
back in searching of structures

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.268
over and over wasn't going

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.370
to be the way to go -- but a

01:00:07.437 --> 01:00:08.338
lot of good lessons learned

01:00:08.404 --> 01:00:09.906
from last year we've made it

01:00:09.973 --> 01:00:11.240
this year and still more to do

01:00:12.809 --> 01:00:15.411
station yeah and I'll cover

01:00:15.478 --> 01:00:16.813
-- station coverage which it

01:00:16.879 --> 01:00:17.947
which is kind of -- it's a

01:00:18.014 --> 01:00:20.316
bigger issue than cal fire -- so

01:00:20.383 --> 01:00:21.718
I'll cover it in a bigger issue

01:00:21.784 --> 01:00:23.686
that will include the mutual aid

01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:26.089
-- piece which is the non cal

01:00:26.155 --> 01:00:27.890
fire local government and other

01:00:28.391 --> 01:00:31.327
-- we we are at a point where

01:00:31.394 --> 01:00:33.429
we're recovering still from

01:00:33.496 --> 01:00:35.398
from the loss of jobs that

01:00:35.465 --> 01:00:36.866
occurred during the recession

01:00:37.433 --> 01:00:39.335
and so fire departments across

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:40.837
California across the nation

01:00:40.903 --> 01:00:43.639
are still rebuilding -- staff

01:00:43.706 --> 01:00:45.641
that that the Los during

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:46.943
that period of time and it's

01:00:47.010 --> 01:00:49.746
happening -- but we need

01:00:49.812 --> 01:00:52.915
to -- look at what the staffing

01:00:52.982 --> 01:00:55.218
model is that we need for this

01:00:55.718 --> 01:00:57.954
this new situation where

01:00:58.021 --> 01:01:00.656
in where -- wildfire season

01:01:00.723 --> 01:01:02.725
is year round -- and so we

01:01:02.792 --> 01:01:04.193
do have a year round need

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:06.696
coming back to cal fire for

01:01:06.996 --> 01:01:08.498
more of that year round type

01:01:08.564 --> 01:01:10.266
of staffing that will help

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:11.734
with station coverage because

01:01:11.801 --> 01:01:13.236
will have additional staff

01:01:13.302 --> 01:01:14.570
in the in the summer months

01:01:14.637 --> 01:01:16.439
to be able to back fill fire

01:01:16.506 --> 01:01:19.375
stations -- as we are sending

01:01:19.442 --> 01:01:22.345
engines out to going fires

01:01:22.812 --> 01:01:24.680
-- but it's it's a bigger

01:01:24.747 --> 01:01:26.582
issue as I mentioned across

01:01:26.649 --> 01:01:27.917
the state there is there is a

01:01:27.984 --> 01:01:30.520
need for -- more equipment

01:01:30.586 --> 01:01:31.888
and more personnel that are

01:01:31.954 --> 01:01:34.257
trained in order to provide

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:36.325
that back filling keep the the

01:01:36.392 --> 01:01:38.828
nine one one regular emergency

01:01:38.895 --> 01:01:42.031
service needs -- covered behind

01:01:42.298 --> 01:01:43.699
these mega events that were

01:01:43.766 --> 01:01:46.002
sending people across the state

01:01:49.338 --> 01:01:50.773
I'll just close out said I I

01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.974
we we welcome the opportunity

01:01:52.041 --> 01:01:53.076
to have further discussions

01:01:53.142 --> 01:01:55.378
with you -- I can tell you

01:01:55.445 --> 01:01:56.879
that from emerging management

01:01:56.946 --> 01:01:58.648
standpoint we have multiple

01:01:58.714 --> 01:02:00.083
task forces that are stood

01:02:00.149 --> 01:02:01.551
up simultaneously that we're

01:02:01.617 --> 01:02:03.753
trying to address issues that

01:02:03.820 --> 01:02:05.054
are ongoing from the event that

01:02:05.121 --> 01:02:07.190
is taking place -- the schools

01:02:07.256 --> 01:02:08.624
issue -- that you mentioned

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:10.593
is is absolute critical to us

01:02:10.660 --> 01:02:12.462
simultaneously were working a

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.297
debris removal -- and how to

01:02:14.363 --> 01:02:15.498
get all those cell that has

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.667
-- so debris removed there on

01:02:17.733 --> 01:02:19.502
the watershed -- is another

01:02:19.569 --> 01:02:21.237
key functional area that were

01:02:21.537 --> 01:02:23.439
actively engaged in a both

01:02:23.506 --> 01:02:24.974
for protection and for follow

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.909
on -- and then and then right

01:02:26.976 --> 01:02:28.678
now equally with the that we

01:02:28.744 --> 01:02:29.712
would say within that same

01:02:29.779 --> 01:02:31.147
group is and we're dealing

01:02:31.214 --> 01:02:32.815
with a fairly large -- shelter

01:02:32.882 --> 01:02:34.250
population still it's going to

01:02:34.317 --> 01:02:36.519
transition into a housing --

01:02:36.586 --> 01:02:38.988
issue that we have to resolve --

01:02:39.255 --> 01:02:40.656
for finding a way for temporary

01:02:40.723 --> 01:02:42.892
housing -- for the survivors

01:02:42.959 --> 01:02:44.994
-- -- particularly in in the

01:02:45.061 --> 01:02:47.296
that area so those task forces

01:02:47.363 --> 01:02:50.166
are all on going right now --

01:02:50.233 --> 01:02:51.334
and we welcome the opportunity

01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:53.202
to to kind of lay that out

01:02:53.269 --> 01:02:54.770
for you at a future date

01:02:58.841 --> 01:03:00.376
the earlier this year we had

01:03:00.443 --> 01:03:02.345
the -- the presidential alert

01:03:02.612 --> 01:03:05.248
-- tested that took place and

01:03:05.581 --> 01:03:07.683
-- help me understand if all

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.752
devices all mobile devices

01:03:09.819 --> 01:03:11.954
are required to be sold by

01:03:12.021 --> 01:03:14.490
their manufacturers to --

01:03:14.924 --> 01:03:16.559
Kerry those types of alerts

01:03:20.963 --> 01:03:23.733
so all devices are required to

01:03:23.799 --> 01:03:26.369
receive a presidential or -- so

01:03:26.669 --> 01:03:27.703
would you would you by the way

01:03:27.770 --> 01:03:29.205
explained with that presidential

01:03:29.272 --> 01:03:31.140
learned is so weak when you do

01:03:31.207 --> 01:03:33.709
-- a wireless emergency alert --

01:03:34.544 --> 01:03:36.345
that there are the most common

01:03:36.412 --> 01:03:37.747
type that everybody's familiar

01:03:37.813 --> 01:03:39.182
with is an amber alert --

01:03:39.248 --> 01:03:41.317
which we see administered by

01:03:41.384 --> 01:03:43.319
the California patrol as part

01:03:43.386 --> 01:03:45.054
of that -- alerting process

01:03:45.388 --> 01:03:47.356
-- you also will see alerts to

01:03:47.423 --> 01:03:48.291
come from the National Weather

01:03:48.357 --> 01:03:49.792
Service where you can see when

01:03:49.859 --> 01:03:51.060
that comes from presidential

01:03:51.127 --> 01:03:52.495
-- so house of those first

01:03:52.562 --> 01:03:54.330
time have been tested and --

01:03:54.830 --> 01:03:56.766
-- was -- the results on that

01:03:56.832 --> 01:03:58.267
-- have come back I don't

01:03:58.334 --> 01:03:59.202
have all the exact out in

01:03:59.268 --> 01:04:00.269
front of me here but they were

01:04:00.336 --> 01:04:01.337
so mixed results depending

01:04:01.404 --> 01:04:02.305
on where you're at that the

01:04:02.371 --> 01:04:04.874
some latency -- of that alert

01:04:05.341 --> 01:04:08.044
-- but like -- as previously

01:04:08.110 --> 01:04:10.546
discussed a practice and

01:04:10.613 --> 01:04:12.715
-- occasional usage and

01:04:12.782 --> 01:04:13.749
understanding how to to the

01:04:13.816 --> 01:04:15.418
minister that program obviously

01:04:15.484 --> 01:04:17.186
makes it more successful

01:04:18.354 --> 01:04:19.655
so that was what I and I don't

01:04:19.722 --> 01:04:21.090
want to get in to talk about

01:04:21.157 --> 01:04:22.458
the value of that alert so that

01:04:22.525 --> 01:04:23.426
that was essentially a test

01:04:23.492 --> 01:04:25.628
of an alert that can be used

01:04:25.695 --> 01:04:26.929
by state and local agencies

01:04:26.996 --> 01:04:28.164
and has been used by state

01:04:28.231 --> 01:04:30.066
and local agencies for many

01:04:30.132 --> 01:04:32.735
times before that national test

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:35.504
was was conducted in so

01:04:35.705 --> 01:04:37.907
that equipments the coming that

01:04:37.974 --> 01:04:39.909
all of us have it is equipped

01:04:39.976 --> 01:04:42.044
-- required -- so that all of

01:04:42.111 --> 01:04:43.479
us can get those alerts in state

01:04:43.546 --> 01:04:44.614
and local agencies can avail

01:04:44.680 --> 01:04:47.250
themselves of it that

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:48.818
is correct in and when we talk

01:04:48.884 --> 01:04:50.720
about alert warning -- obviously

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.221
there's multiple levels for the

01:04:52.288 --> 01:04:53.756
wireless modular to make it from

01:04:53.823 --> 01:04:55.224
broadcasting stations might have

01:04:55.291 --> 01:04:57.426
sirens yep local a prescriptions

01:04:57.493 --> 01:04:58.995
at a many different types will

01:04:59.061 --> 01:05:01.197
be used as a down to the last

01:05:01.264 --> 01:05:02.698
piece which is door to door --

01:05:02.765 --> 01:05:03.766
working on it but you're you're

01:05:03.833 --> 01:05:05.901
actually correct it's -- that

01:05:05.968 --> 01:05:07.303
one and then of course the one

01:05:07.370 --> 01:05:08.704
that you saw them straight away

01:05:08.771 --> 01:05:09.639
of where they were doing it to

01:05:09.705 --> 01:05:11.107
falsely state that that that

01:05:11.173 --> 01:05:12.775
was in a test that was an error

01:05:13.843 --> 01:05:15.478
was an error in a practiced a

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:18.180
scenario yeah -- the

01:05:18.714 --> 01:05:21.417
-- in in those test

01:05:21.484 --> 01:05:23.686
environments you'll back us

01:05:23.753 --> 01:05:24.720
especially during the North

01:05:24.787 --> 01:05:26.055
Bay fires tubs and nuns

01:05:26.122 --> 01:05:28.658
and and others we --

01:05:29.492 --> 01:05:31.761
-- were were told to sign

01:05:31.827 --> 01:05:32.995
up for the next sole for

01:05:33.062 --> 01:05:35.464
those local opt ins and

01:05:35.531 --> 01:05:37.266
dive in so of course a lot

01:05:37.333 --> 01:05:38.801
of people were not signed up

01:05:38.868 --> 01:05:40.903
for those they didn't go out

01:05:40.970 --> 01:05:42.905
to take that step to to do it

01:05:43.272 --> 01:05:46.075
-- prior to the the disaster

01:05:46.409 --> 01:05:47.677
I'd subscription of course

01:05:47.743 --> 01:05:49.945
took off -- afterward

01:05:51.347 --> 01:05:53.516
what can you tell me the

01:05:53.582 --> 01:05:54.817
that is the benefit for that

01:05:54.884 --> 01:05:56.185
because when we do sign up for

01:05:56.252 --> 01:05:57.987
an excellence by zip code to

01:05:58.054 --> 01:06:00.623
to get that more localized --

01:06:00.890 --> 01:06:03.592
targeted alert and warning

01:06:03.659 --> 01:06:06.095
then -- people who use

01:06:06.162 --> 01:06:07.296
the wireless emergency

01:06:07.363 --> 01:06:08.564
alerts are able to give

01:06:11.400 --> 01:06:12.635
there are some limitations with

01:06:12.702 --> 01:06:14.036
current W. system the number

01:06:14.103 --> 01:06:15.504
of characters -- is probably

01:06:15.571 --> 01:06:17.006
a good example -- and then

01:06:17.073 --> 01:06:18.808
also the comfort level at the

01:06:18.874 --> 01:06:21.510
local level so that's really --

01:06:21.577 --> 01:06:23.512
where you you like to see our

01:06:23.579 --> 01:06:25.381
our local partners a deciding

01:06:25.448 --> 01:06:26.315
what they when he is with its

01:06:26.382 --> 01:06:27.850
code red with its ever bridge

01:06:27.917 --> 01:06:29.952
whether it's an excel whatever

01:06:30.019 --> 01:06:32.521
they're using -- to push and

01:06:32.588 --> 01:06:34.056
-- information out on a more

01:06:34.123 --> 01:06:36.192
regular basis -- I pas gives

01:06:36.258 --> 01:06:37.927
them another tool the tool kit

01:06:38.260 --> 01:06:39.628
-- at the federal level it's for

01:06:39.695 --> 01:06:41.097
them it's free and and so that's

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:42.732
where we like to see if they

01:06:42.798 --> 01:06:44.834
have nothing else please sign up

01:06:45.167 --> 01:06:47.570
-- but I mean you you want

01:06:48.070 --> 01:06:49.572
at the local level to have as

01:06:49.638 --> 01:06:50.706
many tools which will gets in

01:06:50.773 --> 01:06:52.508
the ability to feel comfortable

01:06:52.775 --> 01:06:54.643
a crafting a message in giving

01:06:54.710 --> 01:06:56.479
you on that alert that there's

01:06:56.545 --> 01:06:57.279
something that might you need

01:06:57.346 --> 01:06:58.948
to be aware of or the warning

01:06:59.014 --> 01:07:00.683
which and you take action --

01:07:00.750 --> 01:07:02.918
afterwards there was a and

01:07:02.985 --> 01:07:04.887
and I'm not going to engage in

01:07:04.954 --> 01:07:06.255
critique but there is criticism

01:07:06.322 --> 01:07:08.391
about the lack of use or

01:07:08.457 --> 01:07:11.594
use of we -- -- in cinema

01:07:11.927 --> 01:07:14.196
and I have had so many

01:07:14.263 --> 01:07:15.931
conflicting conversations from

01:07:15.998 --> 01:07:19.402
people about how targeted

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:22.304
it can actually be implemented

01:07:22.705 --> 01:07:25.207
-- and that it is not -- and

01:07:25.274 --> 01:07:26.675
it of course it we've talked

01:07:26.742 --> 01:07:28.677
about the lack of training --

01:07:29.078 --> 01:07:30.880
but a about how how much for the

01:07:30.946 --> 01:07:32.448
scalpel they can really approach

01:07:32.515 --> 01:07:34.250
a community with those tools

01:07:36.986 --> 01:07:38.687
I can say that the obvious

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:40.356
technology continues to improve

01:07:40.423 --> 01:07:42.224
-- and -- if you remember

01:07:42.291 --> 01:07:43.526
from that report there was

01:07:43.926 --> 01:07:46.562
-- the folks that were --

01:07:46.996 --> 01:07:49.098
-- looking at that using that

01:07:49.165 --> 01:07:50.599
-- had just had some older

01:07:50.666 --> 01:07:51.400
information they weren't

01:07:51.467 --> 01:07:52.601
aware that the technology an

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:54.437
improvement on the ability

01:07:54.503 --> 01:07:56.405
to do some better shape files

01:07:56.472 --> 01:07:58.407
for your alerts -- was there

01:07:58.707 --> 01:07:59.909
that being said when you're

01:07:59.975 --> 01:08:01.010
when you're broadcasting alert

01:08:01.076 --> 01:08:02.678
over sell either platform it's

01:08:02.745 --> 01:08:03.746
going to bleed over there's

01:08:03.813 --> 01:08:05.281
always a of the over point in

01:08:05.347 --> 01:08:07.817
between areas -- but

01:08:07.883 --> 01:08:10.519
what we have found is that --

01:08:11.454 --> 01:08:12.855
that there's kind of a myth

01:08:12.922 --> 01:08:15.491
that that -- -- sending

01:08:15.558 --> 01:08:17.726
these out will somehow be --

01:08:17.793 --> 01:08:19.161
create other problems for her

01:08:19.228 --> 01:08:20.796
panic and and that's just not

01:08:20.863 --> 01:08:22.631
of -- been the case it's very

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.167
very -- so we find that people

01:08:25.234 --> 01:08:25.935
want to know when there's a

01:08:26.001 --> 01:08:28.037
problem and they want you to

01:08:28.103 --> 01:08:29.205
send them that information

01:08:29.271 --> 01:08:30.172
or something they need to be

01:08:30.239 --> 01:08:32.875
aware of we had a --

01:08:34.510 --> 01:08:36.145
there is the great case

01:08:36.212 --> 01:08:37.780
study of of lake and how they

01:08:37.847 --> 01:08:39.582
learned from how they use

01:08:39.648 --> 01:08:40.816
these tools and then use them

01:08:40.883 --> 01:08:42.318
very effectively and and lake

01:08:42.384 --> 01:08:43.686
has so many challenges which

01:08:43.919 --> 01:08:45.187
the chief had mentioned but

01:08:45.554 --> 01:08:47.490
geographically challenged but

01:08:47.556 --> 01:08:51.060
also -- of very low density

01:08:51.293 --> 01:08:53.696
-- population as well --

01:08:53.762 --> 01:08:55.664
but but very few paths of

01:08:55.731 --> 01:08:57.600
egress from the community

01:08:57.666 --> 01:08:58.667
which is extraordinarily

01:08:58.734 --> 01:09:01.003
challenging we also saw

01:09:01.670 --> 01:09:03.439
-- a community impacted by

01:09:03.506 --> 01:09:04.840
this with the Oroville dam

01:09:05.341 --> 01:09:08.177
evacuation -- in a in a similar

01:09:08.244 --> 01:09:09.578
community in the same region

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:12.314
as the campfire where you know

01:09:12.381 --> 01:09:13.482
a hundred and eighty thousand

01:09:13.549 --> 01:09:15.451
people were told to evacuate

01:09:15.684 --> 01:09:17.653
we saw with the impacts were

01:09:17.720 --> 01:09:20.523
like -- on --

01:09:20.589 --> 01:09:23.192
the the the few arteries out

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:25.528
of that community and south and

01:09:25.594 --> 01:09:27.363
that that was a demonstration

01:09:27.429 --> 01:09:29.798
of the fear the concern

01:09:29.865 --> 01:09:31.867
the people had about doing too

01:09:31.934 --> 01:09:34.570
broad of an evacuation we

01:09:34.637 --> 01:09:37.540
saw -- this complicated

01:09:37.606 --> 01:09:39.408
with the campfire where they

01:09:39.475 --> 01:09:42.344
had a plan of phased evacuations

01:09:42.411 --> 01:09:44.513
that -- the speed of which the

01:09:44.580 --> 01:09:46.615
fire just overtook what that

01:09:46.682 --> 01:09:48.250
plan could ever could ever deal

01:09:48.317 --> 01:09:49.418
with that plan would have dealt

01:09:49.485 --> 01:09:51.820
with the -- B.

01:09:51.887 --> 01:09:54.557
E. impacted of of traffic

01:09:54.623 --> 01:09:56.458
on the few pass outside of

01:09:56.525 --> 01:09:59.328
paradise this this

01:09:59.395 --> 01:10:01.997
is a really challenging

01:10:02.064 --> 01:10:04.300
complication of we have

01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:06.502
it were very close to what

01:10:06.569 --> 01:10:07.736
while in urban interface for in

01:10:07.803 --> 01:10:10.306
it we have a very fast

01:10:10.372 --> 01:10:12.474
fire but we never developed

01:10:12.541 --> 01:10:14.310
the community to have --

01:10:14.376 --> 01:10:17.146
egress that would allow

01:10:17.212 --> 01:10:18.781
for evacuation in these type

01:10:18.847 --> 01:10:20.683
of in in these types of events

01:10:21.717 --> 01:10:23.953
and that's when we're talking

01:10:24.019 --> 01:10:25.654
about alerting communities

01:10:26.589 --> 01:10:28.424
and we're just throwing them at

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:31.060
you know these clocked pass

01:10:31.126 --> 01:10:32.561
out of town and we we heard

01:10:32.628 --> 01:10:34.196
about people had to flee their

01:10:34.263 --> 01:10:36.031
cars for died in their cars I

01:10:36.098 --> 01:10:39.001
remember -- listening to NPR

01:10:39.068 --> 01:10:40.369
one morning and and they had

01:10:40.436 --> 01:10:42.571
someone from cal fire try to

01:10:42.638 --> 01:10:44.473
give advice on how to hide in

01:10:44.540 --> 01:10:46.609
the car in a fire which was

01:10:46.675 --> 01:10:49.011
just heroin to listen to --

01:10:49.945 --> 01:10:52.381
how to even get to that point

01:10:52.848 --> 01:10:55.017
-- I don't think we can

01:10:55.084 --> 01:10:56.018
legislate our way out of

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:57.620
that unless you're legislate

01:10:57.686 --> 01:10:59.521
that we need to have more

01:10:59.588 --> 01:11:00.990
ways out of communities

01:11:04.560 --> 01:11:06.695
here are related to that

01:11:06.762 --> 01:11:07.529
that's really a land use

01:11:07.596 --> 01:11:09.531
planning issue on that piece

01:11:09.598 --> 01:11:11.600
-- I think the alerting

01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.068
that we're talking about nay

01:11:13.135 --> 01:11:15.804
primarily here is is important

01:11:15.871 --> 01:11:18.073
and and more surgically --

01:11:18.140 --> 01:11:20.442
implementing that and then also

01:11:21.377 --> 01:11:23.746
early whatever early means and

01:11:23.812 --> 01:11:25.047
we talked about that previously

01:11:25.114 --> 01:11:27.149
-- I did -- needing to get a

01:11:27.216 --> 01:11:28.851
a time line on that but land

01:11:28.917 --> 01:11:30.285
use planning is a big piece

01:11:30.352 --> 01:11:32.121
of this is well we need to

01:11:32.187 --> 01:11:34.823
look at communities as --

01:11:35.658 --> 01:11:37.593
ways of mom at the the community

01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:38.861
arteries as ways of moving

01:11:38.927 --> 01:11:40.396
people out of the way as well

01:11:41.063 --> 01:11:43.699
and then -- where there

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:45.567
are challenges we need to we

01:11:45.634 --> 01:11:48.070
need to look at what shelter

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.738
in place zones look like and

01:11:49.805 --> 01:11:51.106
what they need to look like in

01:11:51.173 --> 01:11:52.708
order to get people to those

01:11:52.775 --> 01:11:54.109
spots that are closer to their

01:11:54.176 --> 01:11:55.911
homes allow for the fire to

01:11:55.978 --> 01:11:58.147
go through which is how a lot

01:11:58.213 --> 01:11:59.548
of the people ended up writing

01:11:59.615 --> 01:12:01.850
out -- the campfire they they

01:12:01.917 --> 01:12:03.619
only made it to a point in the

01:12:03.686 --> 01:12:06.121
community where some resources

01:12:06.188 --> 01:12:07.690
were there to be able to help

01:12:07.756 --> 01:12:09.258
keep them safe while the fire

01:12:09.324 --> 01:12:11.493
went past and we need to

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.394
do that but if we're going to

01:12:12.461 --> 01:12:13.829
do that we need to do that in

01:12:13.896 --> 01:12:16.065
a planned and orderly way that

01:12:16.131 --> 01:12:18.000
we that we developed and we

01:12:18.067 --> 01:12:19.601
understand the resources that

01:12:19.668 --> 01:12:22.071
are at those sheltering in place

01:12:22.271 --> 01:12:24.573
points -- we can't just --

01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:27.643
haphazardly do this has had

01:12:27.710 --> 01:12:29.144
to happen in that community

01:12:29.678 --> 01:12:31.080
me they they knew where those

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.682
their those points were --

01:12:34.083 --> 01:12:36.719
but we need to have a whole

01:12:36.785 --> 01:12:39.254
system of getting people out

01:12:39.321 --> 01:12:41.223
first and then sheltering

01:12:41.290 --> 01:12:42.591
where we have to for a short

01:12:42.658 --> 01:12:43.892
period of time until it's safe

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:45.360
to get people I know we need

01:12:45.427 --> 01:12:46.862
to move on our next panel of

01:12:46.929 --> 01:12:48.697
we have voluntary guidelines

01:12:48.764 --> 01:12:49.531
that are coming up out of

01:12:49.598 --> 01:12:50.766
legislation that we passed

01:12:50.833 --> 01:12:53.368
this past year do you envision

01:12:53.435 --> 01:12:56.105
that these will become de facto

01:12:56.338 --> 01:12:58.774
standards or are they voluntary

01:12:58.841 --> 01:12:59.875
because we've got fifty eight

01:12:59.942 --> 01:13:01.210
counties with very different

01:13:01.276 --> 01:13:02.411
communities and and there needs

01:13:02.478 --> 01:13:03.879
to be more flexibility thank

01:13:03.946 --> 01:13:06.482
you re talking about the --

01:13:07.216 --> 01:13:09.852
on yeah I I think --

01:13:10.352 --> 01:13:12.888
-- that the end of it

01:13:13.222 --> 01:13:14.857
what's happened here is going to

01:13:15.190 --> 01:13:17.326
really put an emphasis on on

01:13:17.392 --> 01:13:19.194
what voluntary means voluntary

01:13:19.261 --> 01:13:21.430
Terry is going to be a need to

01:13:22.865 --> 01:13:24.833
be before we do go on I had one

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:26.301
other question with that and

01:13:26.368 --> 01:13:27.936
then perhaps before the next

01:13:28.003 --> 01:13:29.571
panel center stern is joined

01:13:29.638 --> 01:13:30.572
us and I'd like to give them

01:13:30.639 --> 01:13:31.874
an opportunity to share with us

01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.610
briefly -- his thoughts on

01:13:34.977 --> 01:13:36.445
-- if you could and particularly

01:13:36.512 --> 01:13:38.313
the emergency the warning system

01:13:38.647 --> 01:13:39.915
there are so many parts to

01:13:39.982 --> 01:13:42.751
this land uses one --

01:13:42.818 --> 01:13:45.220
and access is another hardening

01:13:45.287 --> 01:13:46.522
our infrastructure there in

01:13:46.588 --> 01:13:48.123
many different we're gonna try

01:13:48.190 --> 01:13:49.925
if we can stay focused on this

01:13:49.992 --> 01:13:52.261
alert system issue and so my

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:55.330
question a deals with them

01:13:55.764 --> 01:13:57.366
you know we rely heavily on

01:13:57.432 --> 01:13:59.601
wireless telephone companies a

01:13:59.668 --> 01:14:02.037
two day as we look at how are

01:14:02.104 --> 01:14:03.705
we going to notify people fewer

01:14:03.772 --> 01:14:05.140
and fewer people have landline

01:14:05.207 --> 01:14:06.842
so reversed nine one one isn't

01:14:06.909 --> 01:14:08.577
as effective I know in one of

01:14:08.644 --> 01:14:10.746
the fires we had -- we ended

01:14:10.813 --> 01:14:11.947
up being alerted when a police

01:14:12.014 --> 01:14:13.182
officer came to our bedroom

01:14:13.248 --> 01:14:14.850
window -- and knocked on the

01:14:14.917 --> 01:14:16.451
door and said it's time to leave

01:14:16.852 --> 01:14:18.821
not exactly a high tech approach

01:14:19.121 --> 01:14:21.256
-- and I know we keep doing that

01:14:21.323 --> 01:14:23.358
-- but we are relying heavily

01:14:23.425 --> 01:14:26.128
now on wireless telephone --

01:14:26.195 --> 01:14:27.763
I'd like I'd like to ask you

01:14:27.963 --> 01:14:31.300
how -- -- involved

01:14:31.366 --> 01:14:32.935
are our wireless telephone

01:14:33.001 --> 01:14:35.370
companies -- at this point

01:14:35.637 --> 01:14:37.906
-- in the process of issuing

01:14:37.973 --> 01:14:39.575
telephone alerts cellphone

01:14:39.641 --> 01:14:41.376
alerts to the public could you

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:43.545
tell us -- whether they are

01:14:43.612 --> 01:14:45.047
working with you to harden that

01:14:45.113 --> 01:14:47.950
infrastructure -- what we can

01:14:48.016 --> 01:14:49.284
and should be doing to get

01:14:49.351 --> 01:14:52.020
their engagement in this --

01:14:52.087 --> 01:14:53.355
because they they are going to

01:14:53.422 --> 01:14:54.790
become when they are one of the

01:14:54.857 --> 01:14:57.693
critical notification -- avenues

01:14:57.759 --> 01:14:59.528
and if they're not participating

01:14:59.595 --> 01:15:00.929
if they're not cooperating if

01:15:00.996 --> 01:15:02.931
they're not focusing at all

01:15:02.998 --> 01:15:04.566
on this issue that is probably

01:15:04.633 --> 01:15:05.801
something we should take a look

01:15:05.868 --> 01:15:07.135
at could you respond to that

01:15:10.005 --> 01:15:11.473
so our our cellular partners

01:15:11.540 --> 01:15:12.574
said as you pointed out our

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.643
art it is actually critical --

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:15.878
that that they're part of this

01:15:15.944 --> 01:15:18.180
equation -- fort because that's

01:15:18.247 --> 01:15:19.815
the backbone of which we --

01:15:19.882 --> 01:15:21.617
push all of this information --

01:15:21.683 --> 01:15:24.019
out so -- I'll say that they're

01:15:24.086 --> 01:15:25.087
they're actively involved this

01:15:25.153 --> 01:15:26.288
particular the recoveries are

01:15:26.355 --> 01:15:27.656
stages that were in response

01:15:27.723 --> 01:15:28.657
for ages that we're in right

01:15:28.724 --> 01:15:31.293
now of the fight -- as far

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.228
as the overall hardening of

01:15:33.295 --> 01:15:34.396
their infrastructure I don't

01:15:34.463 --> 01:15:35.530
have that information is not

01:15:35.597 --> 01:15:36.732
shared that with this at this

01:15:36.798 --> 01:15:39.201
time I do know that -- it

01:15:39.268 --> 01:15:40.569
is a weak point it's not public

01:15:40.636 --> 01:15:42.070
safety great I can I can say

01:15:42.137 --> 01:15:44.473
that -- that it's that is a true

01:15:44.539 --> 01:15:47.009
statement -- fort other model

01:15:47.075 --> 01:15:48.443
isn't necessarily built on that

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:49.511
when they when they designed it

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:50.979
but obviously the criticality of

01:15:51.046 --> 01:15:53.282
what -- we rely on -- has

01:15:53.348 --> 01:15:55.751
change so -- they are partners

01:15:55.817 --> 01:15:56.985
and they they obviously want

01:15:57.052 --> 01:15:58.987
third their networks -- to

01:15:59.054 --> 01:16:00.088
be functioning it's what they

01:16:00.155 --> 01:16:01.590
do for their business model

01:16:01.990 --> 01:16:04.092
-- but when they do go down

01:16:04.159 --> 01:16:05.861
because fiber -- either gets

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:07.796
burned over or towers and that

01:16:07.863 --> 01:16:09.965
backbone goes down on when it's

01:16:10.032 --> 01:16:11.133
when it's impacting its down

01:16:11.199 --> 01:16:12.868
for weeks not days you know

01:16:12.935 --> 01:16:14.436
it's it it takes some time to

01:16:14.503 --> 01:16:15.904
recover restore that and we see

01:16:15.971 --> 01:16:17.506
that in the hurricanes were in

01:16:17.572 --> 01:16:18.640
fire said that we're dealing

01:16:18.707 --> 01:16:20.075
with -- but they do everything

01:16:20.142 --> 01:16:21.476
in our power afterwards to try

01:16:21.543 --> 01:16:23.612
to find ways to bring coverage

01:16:23.679 --> 01:16:25.180
back as quickly as possible

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.082
except that doesn't help us

01:16:27.149 --> 01:16:28.083
when we're trying to use those

01:16:28.150 --> 01:16:29.718
wireless systems to notify

01:16:29.785 --> 01:16:31.353
people of the need to get out

01:16:32.821 --> 01:16:34.756
it is critical those as our

01:16:34.823 --> 01:16:37.492
salary is so the power in

01:16:37.559 --> 01:16:39.795
in in in the whole system

01:16:40.228 --> 01:16:41.396
without power they don't run

01:16:41.463 --> 01:16:42.931
forever the don't let the bed

01:16:42.998 --> 01:16:44.633
have something back mark again

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:45.634
you go back to your comment

01:16:45.701 --> 01:16:47.569
about role infrastructure

01:16:48.003 --> 01:16:49.471
needs to be protected all the

01:16:49.538 --> 01:16:51.707
way around in and I'd

01:16:51.773 --> 01:16:53.542
be remiss to not say that to

01:16:55.077 --> 01:16:56.111
going back to our nine one

01:16:56.178 --> 01:16:58.013
one funding side of the house

01:16:58.647 --> 01:17:00.248
Callaway S. looks forward

01:17:00.315 --> 01:17:01.249
to working with the incoming

01:17:01.316 --> 01:17:03.485
legislature in the new governor

01:17:03.785 --> 01:17:05.787
to try to resolve the ongoing

01:17:05.854 --> 01:17:07.823
funding that we need for

01:17:07.889 --> 01:17:09.124
local government in for the

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.293
state's system for the future

01:17:12.527 --> 01:17:14.730
thank you thank you --

01:17:15.964 --> 01:17:16.932
did you want to add something

01:17:16.999 --> 01:17:18.166
that you know I just I was gonna

01:17:18.233 --> 01:17:19.668
say that yes please that that

01:17:19.735 --> 01:17:21.970
that as Kim said to secure said

01:17:22.971 --> 01:17:24.573
next Gen nine one one is going

01:17:24.639 --> 01:17:26.008
to bring other opportunities

01:17:26.074 --> 01:17:27.042
other technologies their

01:17:27.109 --> 01:17:28.510
other states that are doing

01:17:29.044 --> 01:17:30.379
things with those systems that

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:32.814
are going to allow us to --

01:17:33.115 --> 01:17:35.450
-- to changing potentially

01:17:35.517 --> 01:17:36.351
change how we do a late

01:17:36.418 --> 01:17:37.719
morning and and those other

01:17:37.786 --> 01:17:39.354
is -- comes on the seller's

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:40.722
side -- actually correct also

01:17:40.789 --> 01:17:42.424
applies to the to the cable

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:44.159
community -- that's out there

01:17:44.493 --> 01:17:46.261
if you use -- of wait for all

01:17:46.328 --> 01:17:48.130
of your communications now --

01:17:48.196 --> 01:17:49.498
so there's you know we have

01:17:49.564 --> 01:17:51.533
to have that infrastructure --

01:17:52.167 --> 01:17:54.002
that's resilient redundant and

01:17:54.069 --> 01:17:55.804
-- capable of of surviving so

01:17:55.871 --> 01:17:56.972
we can get the information out

01:17:58.140 --> 01:17:59.941
thank you center stern would you

01:18:00.008 --> 01:18:01.610
like to make an opening comment

01:18:05.380 --> 01:18:07.416
thank you madam chair and -- the

01:18:07.482 --> 01:18:09.551
other members for let me jump in

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.053
on the hearing today appreciated

01:18:11.119 --> 01:18:13.488
-- good to see you

01:18:13.555 --> 01:18:15.390
all thank you for joining

01:18:15.457 --> 01:18:16.725
the it's been a tough couple

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:19.094
weeks here -- I don't wanna

01:18:19.795 --> 01:18:20.829
I wanna stay refined within

01:18:20.896 --> 01:18:22.330
the scope there's a lot to say

01:18:22.397 --> 01:18:24.299
about everything that's happened

01:18:24.366 --> 01:18:26.001
and is happening in will be

01:18:27.135 --> 01:18:29.337
working with you all intensively

01:18:29.404 --> 01:18:31.440
over the next weeks months

01:18:31.506 --> 01:18:33.508
mean even days ray doing god

01:18:33.575 --> 01:18:35.544
rains coming this is all real

01:18:35.610 --> 01:18:37.446
time -- you know we don't know

01:18:37.512 --> 01:18:38.447
what Wednesday and Thursday are

01:18:38.513 --> 01:18:40.449
going to look like that's the

01:18:40.515 --> 01:18:42.684
mode everyone's in here -- so

01:18:42.751 --> 01:18:45.253
very timely hearing today --

01:18:46.755 --> 01:18:47.956
I mean I have I have even

01:18:48.023 --> 01:18:49.658
going into this next potential

01:18:49.724 --> 01:18:51.927
series of small crises we

01:18:51.993 --> 01:18:53.128
hope they are small through

01:18:53.195 --> 01:18:55.697
the winter rain season --

01:18:56.164 --> 01:18:58.600
question just about in

01:18:58.667 --> 01:19:01.103
the in this sort of slide

01:19:01.169 --> 01:19:04.239
vulnerable regions I do we not

01:19:04.306 --> 01:19:06.141
repeat Monna CDO that sort of

01:19:06.208 --> 01:19:08.443
middle of the night scenario

01:19:08.510 --> 01:19:10.912
-- where maybe you do have a

01:19:10.979 --> 01:19:12.747
power vent preceding it maybe

01:19:12.814 --> 01:19:14.983
you don't lot of folks is

01:19:15.050 --> 01:19:17.252
sleep county stood still

01:19:17.319 --> 01:19:18.487
having all opted into these

01:19:18.553 --> 01:19:19.855
frameworks that we know the

01:19:19.921 --> 01:19:21.223
members put a lot of work

01:19:21.289 --> 01:19:23.525
into so not everyone's up to

01:19:23.592 --> 01:19:24.893
speed on the alert system like

01:19:26.428 --> 01:19:28.130
very much right now what

01:19:28.196 --> 01:19:29.965
what's how's it going to look

01:19:30.031 --> 01:19:31.566
for I guess homeowners or or

01:19:31.633 --> 01:19:32.934
or residents in this region

01:19:33.001 --> 01:19:35.170
who are re populating so

01:19:35.637 --> 01:19:37.139
that's my first question just

01:19:37.606 --> 01:19:39.908
-- yeah how do you see this

01:19:39.975 --> 01:19:41.109
playing out and and what we

01:19:41.176 --> 01:19:42.811
hear is really that county's

01:19:43.111 --> 01:19:45.147
leading now in the response

01:19:45.213 --> 01:19:47.749
on on Wolsey -- on both sides

01:19:47.816 --> 01:19:49.217
we have to counties engaged

01:19:49.451 --> 01:19:51.853
to just maybe yeah with that

01:19:52.053 --> 01:19:53.555
sort of overlay not realizing

01:19:53.622 --> 01:19:54.789
that maybe you're not in the

01:19:54.856 --> 01:19:56.892
lead on this how how will that

01:19:56.958 --> 01:19:58.627
communication system look as we

01:20:00.762 --> 01:20:01.763
just try to get through the

01:20:01.830 --> 01:20:04.099
winter I I know there's

01:20:04.166 --> 01:20:06.768
big long term -- reforms

01:20:06.835 --> 01:20:09.137
in other topics but

01:20:11.006 --> 01:20:12.340
I can tell you that I know

01:20:12.407 --> 01:20:13.708
that we work very closely with

01:20:13.775 --> 01:20:16.778
the the county -- -- counties

01:20:16.845 --> 01:20:19.080
and and as part of their

01:20:19.147 --> 01:20:20.415
overall restoration plans

01:20:20.482 --> 01:20:21.983
to help prioritize and work

01:20:22.050 --> 01:20:23.418
together and bring all of the

01:20:23.485 --> 01:20:24.586
necessary resources and our

01:20:24.653 --> 01:20:26.087
other partners a whether it's

01:20:26.154 --> 01:20:27.289
in the utility said household

01:20:27.355 --> 01:20:29.724
as you mentioned -- senator or

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.893
-- any other aspects from it and

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:33.128
so we're we're constantly trying

01:20:33.195 --> 01:20:34.162
to bring resource together

01:20:34.229 --> 01:20:35.664
to help the system in that in

01:20:35.730 --> 01:20:37.699
that -- but for the for the

01:20:37.766 --> 01:20:39.167
communication sides upcoming

01:20:39.234 --> 01:20:41.069
counties are in the lead on that

01:20:41.303 --> 01:20:42.737
like it's it's really they're

01:20:42.804 --> 01:20:44.105
the main point of entry for

01:20:44.172 --> 01:20:46.308
the average resident not from

01:20:46.374 --> 01:20:48.076
state so in the weeks ahead

01:20:48.143 --> 01:20:49.077
that's that's what we're gonna

01:20:49.144 --> 01:20:50.612
see right with in terms of who

01:20:50.679 --> 01:20:52.047
people will be communicating

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.281
with them in the public at large

01:20:53.348 --> 01:20:55.217
like they'll need to tap into VC

01:20:55.283 --> 01:20:58.253
alerts or log on the LA county

01:20:58.320 --> 01:20:59.788
and sort of pursue those

01:20:59.854 --> 01:21:02.357
pathways correct and what

01:21:02.424 --> 01:21:03.525
we're gonna support whatever

01:21:03.592 --> 01:21:05.627
out reach method that the that

01:21:05.694 --> 01:21:07.062
particular county has in place

01:21:07.128 --> 01:21:09.130
in addition to a town halls that

01:21:09.197 --> 01:21:10.665
were working with them on a on a

01:21:10.732 --> 01:21:12.167
regular basis to get information

01:21:12.234 --> 01:21:13.735
out Ross obviously going to

01:21:13.802 --> 01:21:15.604
post and work with them for

01:21:15.670 --> 01:21:17.038
whatever method that they have

01:21:17.105 --> 01:21:18.173
established for this whether

01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:19.908
it's on the web sites whether

01:21:19.975 --> 01:21:21.576
it's -- Britney cation through

01:21:21.643 --> 01:21:22.944
one of those alert morning --

01:21:23.011 --> 01:21:25.447
platforms three using understood

01:21:25.513 --> 01:21:26.748
I yeah I it's something of

01:21:26.815 --> 01:21:28.116
food for thought for you all

01:21:28.183 --> 01:21:30.018
to consider I'm I'm wrestling

01:21:30.085 --> 01:21:31.786
with those moments where we

01:21:31.853 --> 01:21:33.054
just need just like you have

01:21:33.121 --> 01:21:34.756
unified command what unified

01:21:34.823 --> 01:21:36.191
communication actually looks

01:21:36.258 --> 01:21:38.860
like we had twelve competing

01:21:38.927 --> 01:21:40.462
Twitter accounts maybe not

01:21:40.528 --> 01:21:41.796
all competing maybe competing

01:21:41.863 --> 01:21:43.265
their people on scanners

01:21:43.531 --> 01:21:45.066
there's homemade Google maps

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:46.468
going up there's officially

01:21:46.534 --> 01:21:48.670
released cal fire maps people

01:21:48.737 --> 01:21:50.071
are hunting and frenzied for

01:21:50.138 --> 01:21:52.107
information and he's crises and

01:21:52.173 --> 01:21:55.210
so I know it's hard jurisdiction

01:21:55.277 --> 01:21:56.278
only in from a coordinating

01:21:56.344 --> 01:21:58.146
function to to get these

01:21:58.213 --> 01:21:59.414
sort of multi jurisdictional

01:21:59.481 --> 01:22:01.616
events together but I I just

01:22:01.683 --> 01:22:02.717
wanted to tee it up for this

01:22:02.784 --> 01:22:04.319
committee to think on and and

01:22:04.386 --> 01:22:05.654
for you all to think on is

01:22:06.521 --> 01:22:09.124
yeah how do we just

01:22:10.292 --> 01:22:11.960
make it one stop like they're

01:22:12.027 --> 01:22:13.128
really they're really ought to

01:22:13.194 --> 01:22:14.729
be you want it you might not

01:22:14.796 --> 01:22:15.797
even you maybe shouldn't even

01:22:15.864 --> 01:22:16.798
have to know what county you're

01:22:16.865 --> 01:22:17.699
in I mean they're people live in

01:22:17.766 --> 01:22:20.168
bill canyon who who are Ventura

01:22:20.235 --> 01:22:22.270
county but there LA city fire

01:22:22.337 --> 01:22:23.538
and they think of themselves

01:22:23.605 --> 01:22:24.839
as some of them think I'm cells

01:22:24.906 --> 01:22:26.641
Angelenos some like what what

01:22:26.708 --> 01:22:28.243
system ready even on so happy I

01:22:28.310 --> 01:22:30.312
guess maybe you can answer today

01:22:30.378 --> 01:22:31.946
but how does that would unified

01:22:32.013 --> 01:22:33.581
communication là believe it or

01:22:33.648 --> 01:22:36.318
not -- after fires which UC's

01:22:36.384 --> 01:22:38.586
you do see fire law emergency

01:22:38.653 --> 01:22:39.688
management your emergency

01:22:39.754 --> 01:22:40.922
management folks the county

01:22:40.989 --> 01:22:42.891
level and ultimately the city's

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:44.326
really are the ones that you

01:22:44.392 --> 01:22:45.927
know have a strong coordinating

01:22:45.994 --> 01:22:47.362
piece to bring people together

01:22:47.562 --> 01:22:48.596
much like we have unified

01:22:48.663 --> 01:22:49.931
command that would joint

01:22:49.998 --> 01:22:52.300
information center that comes

01:22:52.367 --> 01:22:54.102
together to share information

01:22:54.336 --> 01:22:55.670
and again if you've already

01:22:55.737 --> 01:22:58.373
stipulated that the the

01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:00.141
emergency knows no boundaries

01:23:00.208 --> 01:23:02.811
knows no jurisdictions and so

01:23:03.044 --> 01:23:04.546
they actually start talking

01:23:04.612 --> 01:23:05.680
very really honest pressures

01:23:05.747 --> 01:23:07.449
weather starts coming a lot of

01:23:07.515 --> 01:23:08.717
coordination is taking place

01:23:08.783 --> 01:23:09.818
and I think is the next panel

01:23:09.884 --> 01:23:11.486
comes up you like to be able to

01:23:11.886 --> 01:23:13.254
communicate that were some of

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:15.156
them you know and examples from

01:23:15.223 --> 01:23:16.358
the folk should appear actually

01:23:16.424 --> 01:23:18.226
had experience of last year here

01:23:18.293 --> 01:23:19.794
in Santa Barbara we get ready

01:23:19.861 --> 01:23:22.063
for it again requires us all

01:23:22.330 --> 01:23:23.965
come together much like unified

01:23:24.032 --> 01:23:25.600
command the early planning

01:23:25.667 --> 01:23:28.103
stages -- at all levels of

01:23:28.169 --> 01:23:29.971
government inspection response

01:23:30.038 --> 01:23:31.039
side of the house to get the

01:23:31.106 --> 01:23:32.741
notification out to stay in

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:34.876
the same page this critical

01:23:37.579 --> 01:23:38.279
and the only thing I would

01:23:38.346 --> 01:23:40.048
add for a that is that --

01:23:40.949 --> 01:23:42.150
when at the average the average

01:23:42.217 --> 01:23:43.718
person public actually wants to

01:23:43.785 --> 01:23:45.120
look for a different piece of

01:23:45.186 --> 01:23:46.821
information they they actually

01:23:46.888 --> 01:23:48.556
want confirming information

01:23:48.623 --> 01:23:50.625
from you so you don't you

01:23:50.959 --> 01:23:51.926
to say that you think you're

01:23:51.993 --> 01:23:53.228
gonna have a single one stop

01:23:53.294 --> 01:23:54.562
shopping is really not going

01:23:54.629 --> 01:23:56.064
to be a it because people will

01:23:56.131 --> 01:23:57.565
receive -- double check you a

01:23:57.632 --> 01:23:59.033
one of allocate that and get

01:23:59.100 --> 01:24:00.301
confirming data that is out

01:24:00.368 --> 01:24:01.836
there and from a source temas

01:24:01.903 --> 01:24:03.471
we so appreciate that point

01:24:03.538 --> 01:24:04.906
because I mean you said TV

01:24:04.973 --> 01:24:06.007
news coverage actually play

01:24:06.074 --> 01:24:07.342
an incredibly important and in

01:24:07.409 --> 01:24:09.043
some cases actually a critical

01:24:09.110 --> 01:24:10.845
public safety role between

01:24:10.912 --> 01:24:12.814
the AM radio stations and TV

01:24:12.881 --> 01:24:14.916
news which you're not gonna

01:24:14.983 --> 01:24:16.551
tell channel seven what to say

01:24:16.618 --> 01:24:17.485
right they're gonna say what

01:24:17.552 --> 01:24:18.887
they want to say but in fact

01:24:18.953 --> 01:24:20.522
they played a really helpful

01:24:20.588 --> 01:24:23.258
role in both you know post

01:24:23.324 --> 01:24:25.293
disaster and even during getting

01:24:25.360 --> 01:24:27.162
information out I mean that's

01:24:27.429 --> 01:24:29.497
that's not cellular but depend

01:24:29.564 --> 01:24:31.232
so people literally mean KNX

01:24:31.299 --> 01:24:32.267
was a lifeline for certain

01:24:32.333 --> 01:24:33.768
them so I appreciate that and

01:24:34.068 --> 01:24:35.804
yet maybe that's not the right

01:24:35.870 --> 01:24:37.238
question then maybe it's not

01:24:37.605 --> 01:24:40.108
you know one stop shop but it's

01:24:40.542 --> 01:24:42.410
how to get the most accurate

01:24:42.477 --> 01:24:44.946
real time data out there

01:24:45.513 --> 01:24:47.415
maximizing that transparency

01:24:47.482 --> 01:24:48.783
during an emergency event

01:24:48.850 --> 01:24:50.518
without undercutting your fire

01:24:50.585 --> 01:24:52.086
fighting strategy but really

01:24:52.153 --> 01:24:54.389
empowering all those resources

01:24:54.456 --> 01:24:56.791
we have with maximum data

01:24:56.858 --> 01:24:59.427
about fire movement you know

01:24:59.627 --> 01:25:02.397
-- advanced warnings

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:04.666
sort of looking just aye aye I

01:25:04.732 --> 01:25:06.768
swear there's got to be a better

01:25:06.835 --> 01:25:09.404
way to engaging with the tech

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:11.573
community here -- that we have

01:25:11.639 --> 01:25:13.007
at our disposal like how how

01:25:13.074 --> 01:25:15.009
does that real time fire mapping

01:25:15.076 --> 01:25:16.377
start interact with the public

01:25:16.444 --> 01:25:17.879
and what what can be done

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:20.381
to empower the all these

01:25:20.448 --> 01:25:22.016
nontraditional outlets to and

01:25:22.083 --> 01:25:23.284
I'll leave it at that thank

01:25:23.351 --> 01:25:25.420
each minute match I think just

01:25:25.487 --> 01:25:27.155
a comment we were during the

01:25:27.222 --> 01:25:28.523
Thomas fire I think we were

01:25:28.590 --> 01:25:31.192
all wherever we were relocated

01:25:31.259 --> 01:25:33.361
to watching our local news

01:25:33.695 --> 01:25:35.296
which was on twenty four seven

01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.398
which provided us with the

01:25:37.465 --> 01:25:39.334
best real time information

01:25:39.667 --> 01:25:40.702
as to where the fire was

01:25:40.768 --> 01:25:42.470
going who needed to be on the

01:25:42.537 --> 01:25:44.873
alert -- and again as we've

01:25:44.939 --> 01:25:46.574
been discussing center there

01:25:46.641 --> 01:25:48.443
it's a multi faceted approach

01:25:48.510 --> 01:25:51.079
whether it's radio TV cellular

01:25:51.779 --> 01:25:53.882
internet all the options --

01:25:54.115 --> 01:25:55.783
have to be on the table that's

01:25:55.850 --> 01:25:57.018
why I think we're all looking

01:25:57.085 --> 01:25:57.986
forward to hearing what some

01:25:58.052 --> 01:25:59.554
of those best practices are

01:26:00.955 --> 01:26:02.790
thank you and I want to thank

01:26:03.024 --> 01:26:04.592
the three of you for providing

01:26:04.659 --> 01:26:06.628
-- very valuable information

01:26:06.694 --> 01:26:08.496
to U. S. particularly as we get

01:26:08.563 --> 01:26:09.964
ready to start the legislative

01:26:10.031 --> 01:26:12.400
year -- and and think about

01:26:12.467 --> 01:26:14.235
what what needs to be done --

01:26:14.302 --> 01:26:15.537
and how we can continue to work

01:26:15.603 --> 01:26:17.672
together so think you and for

01:26:17.739 --> 01:26:19.507
your testimony I am going to

01:26:19.574 --> 01:26:22.076
ask the following -- the next

01:26:22.143 --> 01:26:24.045
panels it to please join us

01:26:24.112 --> 01:26:25.847
now and the next panel is

01:26:25.914 --> 01:26:27.849
going to focus on implementing

01:26:27.916 --> 01:26:30.418
change on the ground -- so

01:26:30.485 --> 01:26:31.452
so we're gonna really look at

01:26:31.519 --> 01:26:32.921
what's happening we are going

01:26:32.987 --> 01:26:34.455

01:27:51.065 --> 01:27:52.634
referred to as a reverse nine

01:27:52.700 --> 01:27:54.702
one one system we now brand

01:27:54.769 --> 01:27:56.437

unlisted land line telephone

01:28:00.241 --> 01:28:01.909
numbers as well as opt in the

regional tool that means that

all eighteen cities in the

county itself uses that same

01:28:10.518 --> 01:28:11.953
mass notification system why

01:28:12.020 --> 01:28:13.788
is that important well in the

01:28:13.855 --> 01:28:15.590
two thousand and fourteen fires

01:28:15.657 --> 01:28:17.258
which was a state -- governor

01:28:17.325 --> 01:28:19.894
declared a emergency we had

01:28:19.961 --> 01:28:21.229
one of our cities call us and

01:28:21.295 --> 01:28:22.964
say were overwhelmed can you

01:28:23.031 --> 01:28:24.565
evacuate a certain part of our

01:28:24.632 --> 01:28:26.801
city we said certainly and

01:28:26.868 --> 01:28:28.403
my staff duty officer did so

01:28:29.003 --> 01:28:31.939
registrations and are publicly

01:28:32.006 --> 01:28:33.408
written warning system called

01:28:33.474 --> 01:28:35.410
alert San Diego total five

01:28:35.476 --> 01:28:36.778
hundred and fifty thousand

01:28:36.844 --> 01:28:38.746
mobile phones where a population

01:28:38.813 --> 01:28:40.181
of three point three million

01:28:40.615 --> 01:28:42.116
that's a very high number

01:28:42.183 --> 01:28:43.751
comparatively speaking how we've

01:28:43.818 --> 01:28:45.553
done that we've offered free

01:28:45.620 --> 01:28:48.790
tacos we've offered free lift

01:28:48.856 --> 01:28:51.292
rides we've offered sandwiches

01:28:51.893 --> 01:28:53.194
we've done all sorts of

01:28:53.261 --> 01:28:54.996
promotions in order to convince

01:28:55.063 --> 01:28:56.097
the members of our community

01:28:56.164 --> 01:28:57.565
that it's important for them

01:28:57.632 --> 01:28:59.667
to register their mobile phones

01:29:00.001 --> 01:29:01.703
through our system but well we

01:29:01.769 --> 01:29:04.338
realized years ago is that

01:29:04.772 --> 01:29:06.374
people are shedding their land

01:29:06.441 --> 01:29:08.309
line phone phones more and

01:29:08.376 --> 01:29:09.410
more they're going strictly to

01:29:09.477 --> 01:29:11.379
mobile in fact in that you nine

01:29:11.446 --> 01:29:12.714
one one system which includes

01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:14.515
listed and unlisted a land line

01:29:14.582 --> 01:29:16.918
phones there are only one point

01:29:16.984 --> 01:29:19.120
three million phone numbers left

01:29:19.554 --> 01:29:20.688
so we have three point three

01:29:20.755 --> 01:29:22.690
million in our population we

01:29:22.757 --> 01:29:24.325
have five hundred fifty thousand

01:29:24.392 --> 01:29:26.461
numbers proactive mobile phone

01:29:26.527 --> 01:29:28.129
registrations and we have

01:29:28.196 --> 01:29:29.664
one point three million land

01:29:29.731 --> 01:29:32.100
line phone numbers we also

01:29:32.166 --> 01:29:35.002
recognized that as people shed

01:29:35.069 --> 01:29:37.472
their land line phones that

01:29:37.538 --> 01:29:39.707
these types of predominately

01:29:39.774 --> 01:29:41.342
often systems would not be

01:29:41.409 --> 01:29:42.577
adequate in the years to come

01:29:42.643 --> 01:29:43.878
and that's why in two thousand

01:29:43.945 --> 01:29:45.713
and nine the county of San

01:29:45.780 --> 01:29:47.749
Diego partnered with the Federal

01:29:47.815 --> 01:29:49.117
Communications Commission along

01:29:49.183 --> 01:29:51.319
with FEMA in New York City

01:29:51.586 --> 01:29:53.621
to pilot what is now known as I

01:29:53.688 --> 01:29:55.490
pause and specifically the wires

01:29:55.556 --> 01:29:57.458
wireless emergency alert system

01:29:59.527 --> 01:30:00.828
we've been strong advocates

01:30:00.895 --> 01:30:02.330
for changes to the wireless

01:30:02.396 --> 01:30:03.698
emergency alert system

01:30:04.232 --> 01:30:06.234
and we've advocated for an

01:30:06.300 --> 01:30:07.835
expanded number of characters

01:30:07.902 --> 01:30:09.203
the inclusion of weblinks

01:30:09.270 --> 01:30:10.638
and refined geo targeting

01:30:10.705 --> 01:30:12.306
some of which are up and

01:30:12.373 --> 01:30:13.908
coming in will be implemented

01:30:14.408 --> 01:30:16.210
in the year years to come

01:30:18.212 --> 01:30:21.048
recognizing that we also needed

01:30:21.115 --> 01:30:23.451
to find a way to reach our most

01:30:23.518 --> 01:30:25.686
vulnerable residents -- in

01:30:25.753 --> 01:30:27.054
two thousand eleven we launch

01:30:27.121 --> 01:30:28.756
what's called assessable alert

01:30:28.823 --> 01:30:30.158
San Diego so when a member of

01:30:30.224 --> 01:30:31.359
our community goes on to our

01:30:31.425 --> 01:30:32.827
website which by the way is

01:30:32.894 --> 01:30:35.229
a one stop shop for residents

01:30:35.296 --> 01:30:36.998
anywhere in San Diego county no

01:30:37.064 --> 01:30:38.366
matter what city they live in

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:41.102
to find the definitive map

01:30:41.169 --> 01:30:42.804
of whatever the disaster is

01:30:42.870 --> 01:30:44.639
where the shelters are located

01:30:44.705 --> 01:30:46.674
what the evacuation areas are

01:30:46.741 --> 01:30:48.342
it's located on one website

01:30:48.709 --> 01:30:49.977
eighteen cities in the county

01:30:50.044 --> 01:30:53.047
partner to find that website

01:30:53.114 --> 01:30:55.383
and support that we lunch what's

01:30:55.449 --> 01:30:56.751
called accessible alert San

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.152
Diego so when a member of our

01:30:58.219 --> 01:30:59.821
community goes to that website

01:30:59.887 --> 01:31:02.657

message whatever the protective

01:31:09.263 --> 01:31:11.065
action recommendation is an

01:31:11.132 --> 01:31:12.700

01:31:12.767 --> 01:31:14.035
a contract twenty four hours

and sixty five days a year

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:17.438
with an organization called

01:31:17.505 --> 01:31:19.807
definitely out of Texas we pay

01:31:19.874 --> 01:31:21.976
them when we send out a public

01:31:22.043 --> 01:31:23.878
alert and warning within fifteen

01:31:23.945 --> 01:31:25.179
minutes they turn around a

01:31:25.246 --> 01:31:26.914
short video clip of someone

01:31:26.981 --> 01:31:28.149
communicating that message in

01:31:28.216 --> 01:31:30.318
American Sign Language that end

01:31:30.384 --> 01:31:31.752
user then gets a link to that

01:31:31.819 --> 01:31:33.554
video and is able to view that

01:31:33.621 --> 01:31:35.756
message it also includes text

01:31:35.823 --> 01:31:37.859
and audio along with a message

01:31:40.661 --> 01:31:43.264
now we've used the wireless

01:31:43.331 --> 01:31:44.632
emergency alert system a year

01:31:44.699 --> 01:31:46.968
ago and the lilac fire and

01:31:47.034 --> 01:31:49.637
because we are results in mass

01:31:50.004 --> 01:31:52.607
over notification we've elected

01:31:52.673 --> 01:31:53.975
to do business with we a and

01:31:54.041 --> 01:31:54.942
the way we do pretty much

01:31:55.009 --> 01:31:56.043
everything else as it relates

01:31:56.110 --> 01:31:57.311
to emergency management San

01:31:57.378 --> 01:31:58.579
Diego county which we do it

01:31:58.646 --> 01:32:00.581
as a region so the eighteen

01:32:00.648 --> 01:32:02.116
cities have signed a memorandum

01:32:02.183 --> 01:32:04.285
of understanding such that the

01:32:04.352 --> 01:32:05.953
sheriff's department and my

01:32:06.020 --> 01:32:07.288
office my staff at the office

01:32:07.355 --> 01:32:09.390
of emergency services are the

01:32:09.457 --> 01:32:11.025
only entities that initiate a

01:32:11.092 --> 01:32:12.927
wireless emergency alert what

01:32:12.994 --> 01:32:14.562
does this do well it prevents

01:32:15.096 --> 01:32:16.464
one city from sending out one

01:32:16.530 --> 01:32:17.698
message in another city from

01:32:17.765 --> 01:32:18.799
sending out a conflicting

01:32:18.866 --> 01:32:20.568
message so it's all coordinated

01:32:23.037 --> 01:32:25.139
on the issue of language AB

01:32:25.206 --> 01:32:26.641
eighteen seventy seven a dress

01:32:26.707 --> 01:32:28.609
addresses this aye we don't

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:30.645
currently make outbound calls

01:32:31.612 --> 01:32:32.446
Cullerton warning calls in

01:32:32.513 --> 01:32:34.782
Spanish however within fifteen

01:32:34.849 --> 01:32:36.384
minutes sometimes sooner of

01:32:36.450 --> 01:32:37.518
sending out a public alert and

01:32:37.585 --> 01:32:39.687
warning a translation of that

01:32:39.754 --> 01:32:42.223
message in Spanish is posted to

01:32:42.290 --> 01:32:43.658
both the Spanish version of our

01:32:43.724 --> 01:32:45.726
emergency website it's posted

01:32:45.793 --> 01:32:47.828
to our es de emergency mobile

01:32:47.895 --> 01:32:49.964
application and it's included

01:32:50.031 --> 01:32:51.499
on our Spanish Twitter account

01:32:52.667 --> 01:32:54.068
my office is long recognized

01:32:54.135 --> 01:32:55.236
the need to reach communities

01:32:55.303 --> 01:32:56.837
isolated because of language

01:32:57.071 --> 01:32:58.773
work we have a community of

01:32:58.839 --> 01:33:00.308
four hundred thousand people

01:33:00.374 --> 01:33:01.609
who speak languages other than

01:33:01.676 --> 01:33:02.977
English at home and report

01:33:03.044 --> 01:33:04.178
speaking English less than

01:33:04.245 --> 01:33:06.213
very well and two thousand and

01:33:06.280 --> 01:33:07.915
twelve my office in partnership

01:33:07.982 --> 01:33:09.617
with our public health services

01:33:09.684 --> 01:33:10.851
watched what we call the

01:33:10.918 --> 01:33:13.487
partner really system we hold

01:33:13.554 --> 01:33:15.723
focus groups to understand the

01:33:15.790 --> 01:33:17.024
cultural considerations and

01:33:17.091 --> 01:33:18.492
communication preferences of

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:19.961
eight eight different language

01:33:20.027 --> 01:33:21.629
communities those who speak

01:33:21.696 --> 01:33:24.598
Arabic Chinese Karan Korean

01:33:24.665 --> 01:33:26.167
Somali Spanish Tagalog and

01:33:26.233 --> 01:33:28.836
Vietnamese we recruited within

01:33:28.903 --> 01:33:30.071
our community what we call

01:33:30.137 --> 01:33:31.706
language champions within each

01:33:31.772 --> 01:33:33.607
of these language groups their

01:33:33.674 --> 01:33:35.042
faith based leaders refugee

01:33:35.109 --> 01:33:36.477
resettlement agency leaders

01:33:36.544 --> 01:33:38.045
nonprofit service organization

01:33:38.112 --> 01:33:40.281
managers all committed to

01:33:40.348 --> 01:33:41.716
receiving information during

01:33:41.782 --> 01:33:43.818
times of disasters translating

01:33:43.884 --> 01:33:45.286
the information and then

01:33:45.353 --> 01:33:46.487
distributing it back out

01:33:46.554 --> 01:33:47.688
on their networks such as

01:33:47.755 --> 01:33:49.090
their social media accounts

01:33:49.156 --> 01:33:51.258
their websites and posting

01:33:51.325 --> 01:33:52.960
it in their actual facilities

01:33:54.261 --> 01:33:55.663
the group representing the

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.865
most commonly spoken language

01:33:57.932 --> 01:33:59.333
other than English and argues

01:33:59.400 --> 01:34:01.302
that would be Spanish is not

01:34:01.369 --> 01:34:03.204
necessarily the most vulnerable

01:34:03.270 --> 01:34:06.240
population for example thousands

01:34:06.307 --> 01:34:07.641
of newly arrived immigrants

01:34:07.708 --> 01:34:09.977
from Burma who speak Karan

01:34:10.611 --> 01:34:12.013
have no news channels TV

01:34:12.079 --> 01:34:13.280
stations are publications

01:34:13.347 --> 01:34:14.515
which regularly disseminate

01:34:14.582 --> 01:34:15.516
information in their native

01:34:15.583 --> 01:34:18.452
language whereas Spanish media

01:34:18.519 --> 01:34:20.054
abounds in San Diego county

01:34:21.856 --> 01:34:23.224
so it's clear that one size does

01:34:23.290 --> 01:34:24.358
not fit all when it comes to

01:34:24.425 --> 01:34:26.360
public alert and warning I would

01:34:26.427 --> 01:34:28.295
caution against over regulating

01:34:28.562 --> 01:34:30.297
or mandating requirements that

01:34:30.364 --> 01:34:31.732
may be different and rural

01:34:31.799 --> 01:34:33.901
versus urban settings and with

01:34:33.968 --> 01:34:35.569
varying demographics and local

01:34:35.636 --> 01:34:37.872
communities it's clear to

01:34:37.938 --> 01:34:39.407
me that future the future of

01:34:39.473 --> 01:34:40.775
mass notification is we have

01:34:40.841 --> 01:34:43.077
the we a system as of next

01:34:43.144 --> 01:34:45.112
year when the geo targeting is

01:34:45.179 --> 01:34:46.680
refined to a tenth of a mile

01:34:47.415 --> 01:34:48.849
our alert San Diego system

01:34:48.916 --> 01:34:50.151
which is the traditional system

01:34:50.217 --> 01:34:52.086
of both listed and unlisted

01:34:52.153 --> 01:34:53.687
landline telephone numbers

01:34:53.754 --> 01:34:55.556
and proactively registered

01:34:55.623 --> 01:34:56.457
mobile numbers will become

01:34:56.524 --> 01:34:58.426
secondary to the we a system

01:34:59.860 --> 01:35:00.761
but I want to end with the

01:35:00.828 --> 01:35:01.996
fact that we can't put all

01:35:02.063 --> 01:35:03.564
of our emphasis on tools

01:35:03.631 --> 01:35:04.665
the very definition of the

01:35:04.732 --> 01:35:06.033
disasters that systems will

01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.468
be overwhelmed and technology

01:35:07.535 --> 01:35:08.903
will fail that is certain

01:35:10.271 --> 01:35:11.672
where do I think the gap exists

01:35:11.739 --> 01:35:13.274
I think it exists in personnel

01:35:13.607 --> 01:35:16.277
emergency managers my staff

01:35:16.343 --> 01:35:17.545
for the ones who identified

01:35:17.611 --> 01:35:19.146
that there was no -- single

01:35:19.213 --> 01:35:22.016
grade system it was used

01:35:22.083 --> 01:35:23.451
among fire law enforcement

01:35:23.517 --> 01:35:24.652
to communicate the boundaries

01:35:24.718 --> 01:35:25.786
of an area that needed to be

01:35:25.853 --> 01:35:28.189
evacuated we solve that problem

01:35:28.255 --> 01:35:29.356
by working with fire and law

01:35:29.423 --> 01:35:30.891
enforcement to adopt a single

01:35:30.958 --> 01:35:32.726
public safety grid system

01:35:32.993 --> 01:35:34.195
so that communication from

01:35:34.261 --> 01:35:35.696
the field to dispatchers is

01:35:35.763 --> 01:35:38.666
streamlined and quicker my

01:35:38.732 --> 01:35:40.134
staff margins the managers at

01:35:40.201 --> 01:35:41.502
the county level are working to

01:35:41.569 --> 01:35:42.970
train fire and law enforcement

01:35:43.037 --> 01:35:44.638
dispatchers on the wireless

01:35:44.705 --> 01:35:47.108
emergency alert system we've

01:35:47.174 --> 01:35:48.776
emergency managers are promoting

01:35:48.843 --> 01:35:49.944
our alert warning systems

01:35:50.010 --> 01:35:51.412
and disaster preparedness in

01:35:51.479 --> 01:35:54.081
general fire service is there

01:35:54.148 --> 01:35:56.050
to fight fire law enforcement

01:35:56.117 --> 01:35:57.885
is there to stop crying and and

01:35:57.952 --> 01:36:00.287
maintain public safety but into

01:36:00.354 --> 01:36:01.789
other significant investment at

01:36:01.856 --> 01:36:03.991
the local level in people who

01:36:04.058 --> 01:36:05.793
think about these large scale

01:36:05.860 --> 01:36:07.261
catastrophic disasters on a

01:36:07.328 --> 01:36:09.864
daily basis and work to improve

01:36:09.930 --> 01:36:12.133
our resilience to them I believe

01:36:12.199 --> 01:36:13.834
these stories will sadly repeat

01:36:14.668 --> 01:36:15.636
that concludes my testimony

01:36:15.703 --> 01:36:16.804
subject to your questions

01:36:19.974 --> 01:36:21.475
thank you and the next

01:36:21.542 --> 01:36:22.776
we have Jason Terry

01:36:25.479 --> 01:36:26.747
morning senators assembly

01:36:26.814 --> 01:36:28.516
members my name is Jason Terry

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:30.618
I have -- a little bit and a

01:36:30.684 --> 01:36:32.219
lot of the same perspective in a

01:36:32.286 --> 01:36:34.455
very different scenario I it

01:36:34.522 --> 01:36:36.323
a in part of this woman county

01:36:36.390 --> 01:36:37.992
office of emergency services

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:39.693
are county has just north of

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.996
fifty thousand people and one

01:36:42.062 --> 01:36:43.864
incorporated cities so we have

01:36:44.231 --> 01:36:46.967
-- a different scenario

01:36:47.034 --> 01:36:48.736
where we're from but -- a

01:36:48.802 --> 01:36:50.971
lot of the same challenges in

01:36:51.038 --> 01:36:53.207
twenty thirteen atomic county

01:36:53.274 --> 01:36:54.642
was devastated by the rent fire

01:36:54.708 --> 01:36:56.544
which at the time was the third

01:36:56.610 --> 01:36:58.212
largest wildfire in California

01:36:58.712 --> 01:37:00.414
obviously with recent events

01:37:00.748 --> 01:37:02.016
unfortunately that that is

01:37:02.082 --> 01:37:04.251
dropped a little bit lower --

01:37:04.318 --> 01:37:06.287
it was during this time that

01:37:06.353 --> 01:37:08.155
-- we reviewed some of our

01:37:08.222 --> 01:37:09.757
practices some of our emergency

01:37:09.823 --> 01:37:12.626
alerts and tried to find

01:37:12.693 --> 01:37:14.028
additional ways in which we

01:37:14.094 --> 01:37:15.663
could reach out to our community

01:37:16.197 --> 01:37:18.632
-- one of those ways that we

01:37:18.699 --> 01:37:21.168
were -- actually drastically

01:37:21.235 --> 01:37:23.537
increased our membership in

01:37:23.604 --> 01:37:26.073
ever bridge -- was a contract

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.175
with Comcast in eighteen T.

01:37:28.742 --> 01:37:30.177
and looking at the numbers

01:37:30.244 --> 01:37:31.779
today ninety five percent of

01:37:31.845 --> 01:37:32.913
the people that we have signed

01:37:32.980 --> 01:37:34.715
up through ever bridge in our

01:37:34.782 --> 01:37:37.284
county is by those contracts

01:37:37.785 --> 01:37:40.554
-- really only five percent

01:37:40.621 --> 01:37:42.957
have opted in on their own at

01:37:43.023 --> 01:37:44.992
this point in time of course

01:37:45.059 --> 01:37:46.160
we continue to try and work

01:37:46.227 --> 01:37:48.195
with AB public education --

01:37:48.729 --> 01:37:49.697
and a lot of our different

01:37:49.763 --> 01:37:51.065
response activities as mentioned

01:37:51.131 --> 01:37:52.433
earlier we've had storm events

01:37:52.499 --> 01:37:53.567
last couple years we have

01:37:53.634 --> 01:37:56.136
archery mortality epidemic --

01:37:56.203 --> 01:37:58.005
we we incorporate all the public

01:37:58.072 --> 01:37:59.073
information together and just

01:37:59.139 --> 01:38:00.407
trying reaches many citizens

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:01.942
as possible when those events

01:38:02.643 --> 01:38:04.078
-- so that that has been a

01:38:04.144 --> 01:38:06.447
beneficial -- -- tool for us to

01:38:06.513 --> 01:38:08.849
use but at the same time what

01:38:09.083 --> 01:38:10.718
I like was previously mentioned

01:38:10.784 --> 01:38:12.987
-- land lines aren't as popular

01:38:13.053 --> 01:38:15.222
and we see -- some of

01:38:15.289 --> 01:38:16.890
those dropping off and and that

01:38:16.957 --> 01:38:19.627
leads us to one of the issues

01:38:19.693 --> 01:38:21.629
that we have using are ever

01:38:21.695 --> 01:38:23.230
bridge alert system or even aye

01:38:23.297 --> 01:38:26.033
plus system is -- seventy

01:38:26.100 --> 01:38:27.568
percent or more of our county

01:38:27.635 --> 01:38:28.902
is and Stanislaus National

01:38:28.969 --> 01:38:31.305
Forest and I heard it earlier

01:38:31.372 --> 01:38:33.307
-- resilient and reliable

01:38:33.374 --> 01:38:35.009
infrastructure eyes you're

01:38:35.075 --> 01:38:36.510
climbing the hill up one await

01:38:36.577 --> 01:38:37.811
toward Sonora pass for people

01:38:37.878 --> 01:38:39.380
like to recreation or going out

01:38:39.446 --> 01:38:41.448
to Yosemite -- down highway one

01:38:41.515 --> 01:38:44.118
twenty and it depending on

01:38:44.184 --> 01:38:45.152
what service provider you

01:38:45.219 --> 01:38:46.787
have and where you're at you

01:38:46.854 --> 01:38:48.088
mind might not have reliable

01:38:48.155 --> 01:38:50.924
service so using the systems

01:38:50.991 --> 01:38:53.661
as a backbone to notify

01:38:53.727 --> 01:38:56.263
individuals just sometimes is

01:38:56.330 --> 01:38:58.899
insufficient -- and we've used

01:38:58.966 --> 01:39:00.567
it we we use a lot of different

01:39:00.634 --> 01:39:02.403
tools to counteract this --

01:39:02.870 --> 01:39:04.038
we had the Donald fired this

01:39:04.104 --> 01:39:05.506
summer it was approximately

01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:06.640
thirty six thousand acres

01:39:06.707 --> 01:39:07.941
and was up by lake Don L.

01:39:08.442 --> 01:39:10.911
-- and we sent out deputies

01:39:10.978 --> 01:39:12.413
and we were able to evacuate

01:39:12.713 --> 01:39:14.715
a large number of people --

01:39:15.082 --> 01:39:17.084
style a few dozen structures

01:39:17.151 --> 01:39:18.285
were destroyed permitted the

01:39:18.352 --> 01:39:19.720
struck structures in forest

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:21.622
land but no lives were lost

01:39:22.189 --> 01:39:24.558
-- so even though as we we we

01:39:24.625 --> 01:39:26.527
send out the emergency alerts we

01:39:26.593 --> 01:39:29.163
pair that with that -- physical

01:39:29.229 --> 01:39:30.831
contact whenever possible

01:39:30.898 --> 01:39:31.899
and then of course working

01:39:31.965 --> 01:39:33.634
with our local media partners

01:39:33.967 --> 01:39:35.369
working with the the social

01:39:35.436 --> 01:39:37.104
media sites -- through our

01:39:37.171 --> 01:39:38.706
sheriff's office and our fire

01:39:38.772 --> 01:39:41.208
offices -- we are able to fill

01:39:41.275 --> 01:39:44.044
some of those gaps but --

01:39:44.311 --> 01:39:45.879
we still definitely have that

01:39:45.946 --> 01:39:48.549
that gap of you just reliable

01:39:48.615 --> 01:39:50.017
infrastructure up the hill

01:39:52.386 --> 01:39:54.088
at that's all I have I'll take

01:39:54.154 --> 01:39:55.923
any questions if if there are

01:39:55.989 --> 01:39:58.125
any thank you and they think

01:39:58.192 --> 01:39:59.793
will will reserve our questions

01:39:59.860 --> 01:40:00.994
so we hear from all four of

01:40:01.061 --> 01:40:02.596
you I next we have brand you'll

01:40:02.663 --> 01:40:03.731
from Santa Barbara county

01:40:06.433 --> 01:40:07.868
the morning thank you for

01:40:07.935 --> 01:40:08.802
allowing me to speak here

01:40:08.869 --> 01:40:09.937
today and for taking on this

01:40:10.003 --> 01:40:11.638
important issue -- my name is

01:40:11.705 --> 01:40:13.340
Brian you'll members who manager

01:40:13.407 --> 01:40:14.375
with the Santa Barbara county

01:40:14.441 --> 01:40:15.876
office of emergency management

01:40:16.176 --> 01:40:17.878
and one of the -- officials in

01:40:17.945 --> 01:40:19.146
our office that are tasked with

01:40:19.213 --> 01:40:21.415
public learned warning as the

01:40:21.482 --> 01:40:22.850
previous speakers pointed out

01:40:22.916 --> 01:40:23.884
and as we seen in the course

01:40:23.951 --> 01:40:25.586
of several recent disasters in

01:40:25.652 --> 01:40:27.254
our state being able to deliver

01:40:27.321 --> 01:40:29.056
coordinated prompt reliable

01:40:29.123 --> 01:40:31.425
actionable mercy information --

01:40:31.492 --> 01:40:33.060
to the community is critically

01:40:33.127 --> 01:40:35.028
important keeping them safe in

01:40:35.095 --> 01:40:36.563
the last two years alone Santa

01:40:36.630 --> 01:40:37.631
Barbara counties been faced

01:40:37.698 --> 01:40:39.800
with several -- disasters and

01:40:39.867 --> 01:40:41.168
my office is now hundreds of

01:40:41.235 --> 01:40:43.537
alerts and warnings as a result

01:40:43.604 --> 01:40:44.905
of that we've learned a lot

01:40:45.773 --> 01:40:46.840
now and we use that knowledge

01:40:46.907 --> 01:40:48.375
to develop -- what we feel

01:40:48.442 --> 01:40:50.544
is a very sound -- emergency

01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:52.513
alerting protocol one of the

01:40:52.579 --> 01:40:53.647
things I want to convey to you

01:40:53.714 --> 01:40:55.549
today is that while a mercy

01:40:55.616 --> 01:40:56.884
learning may seem simple it

01:40:56.950 --> 01:40:59.386
can be anything but mercy

01:40:59.453 --> 01:41:00.854
incidents can happen suddenly

01:41:00.921 --> 01:41:02.089
leaving officials without enough

01:41:02.156 --> 01:41:03.757
time to get the word out there

01:41:03.824 --> 01:41:04.958
are unavoidable delays in the

01:41:05.025 --> 01:41:07.027
field alerting officials are

01:41:07.094 --> 01:41:08.862
often operating within complete

01:41:08.929 --> 01:41:11.031
non verified information their

01:41:11.098 --> 01:41:12.633
major limitations of learning

01:41:12.699 --> 01:41:15.369
tools and infrastructure there's

01:41:15.436 --> 01:41:16.603
the ever present potential for

01:41:16.670 --> 01:41:17.938
technical failures and human

01:41:18.005 --> 01:41:19.740
error there's also legitimate

01:41:19.807 --> 01:41:21.308
concerns associated with over

01:41:21.375 --> 01:41:22.776
learning causing unnecessary

01:41:22.843 --> 01:41:25.045
panic in one of the most

01:41:25.112 --> 01:41:26.280
difficult often overlooked

01:41:26.346 --> 01:41:28.048
aspects of the learning process

01:41:28.115 --> 01:41:29.316
is associated with crafting

01:41:29.383 --> 01:41:31.718
emergency messages that can be

01:41:31.785 --> 01:41:33.487
easily understood by a diverse

01:41:33.554 --> 01:41:35.389
population and can override

01:41:35.456 --> 01:41:36.957
individuals internal decision

01:41:37.024 --> 01:41:38.358
making process and trigger them

01:41:38.425 --> 01:41:39.593
to take swift and appropriate

01:41:39.660 --> 01:41:40.894
action that'll keep them safe

01:41:42.830 --> 01:41:44.131
one with the state can assist

01:41:44.198 --> 01:41:45.799
local governments is understand

01:41:46.266 --> 01:41:47.367
these and other obstacles

01:41:47.434 --> 01:41:48.836
faced by learning officials

01:41:48.902 --> 01:41:50.103
and helping a more accurate

01:41:50.170 --> 01:41:51.371
picture of the learning process

01:41:51.438 --> 01:41:53.507
for the public we need to make

01:41:53.574 --> 01:41:55.142
clear what's possible and what's

01:41:55.209 --> 01:41:57.678
not currently the public's

01:41:57.744 --> 01:41:59.012
perception is that as soon as

01:41:59.079 --> 01:42:00.414
an incident breaks whether to

01:42:00.481 --> 01:42:03.016
fire debris flow has mess bill

01:42:03.083 --> 01:42:04.384
or other type of emergency

01:42:04.918 --> 01:42:05.986
at all emergency officials

01:42:06.053 --> 01:42:07.621
have to do is press a single

01:42:07.688 --> 01:42:09.389
button and while law and

01:42:09.456 --> 01:42:10.858
alert containing complete and

01:42:10.924 --> 01:42:12.092
accurate information is sent

01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:13.961
out instantaneously reaches

01:42:14.027 --> 01:42:15.362
its intended destination within

01:42:15.429 --> 01:42:16.797
seconds and with geographic

01:42:16.864 --> 01:42:18.432
precision and arrives in

01:42:18.499 --> 01:42:19.800
multiple languages and in

01:42:19.867 --> 01:42:21.969
multiple formats this is the

01:42:22.035 --> 01:42:23.504
perception and forcing the

01:42:23.570 --> 01:42:24.938
reality as mentioned previously

01:42:25.005 --> 01:42:25.973
can be quite different

01:42:27.474 --> 01:42:28.675
another challenge in an area

01:42:28.742 --> 01:42:29.610
where the state can help is

01:42:29.676 --> 01:42:31.845
with coordination the learning

01:42:31.912 --> 01:42:33.680
process is a chain that consists

01:42:33.747 --> 01:42:35.048
of a mix of public and private

01:42:35.115 --> 01:42:36.950
sector entities that spans

01:42:37.017 --> 01:42:38.318
multiple levels of government

01:42:38.385 --> 01:42:40.087
and includes a Thomas cellular

01:42:40.153 --> 01:42:41.522
internet radio television

01:42:41.588 --> 01:42:43.123
cable and utility providers

01:42:44.024 --> 01:42:45.092
each link in the alerting

01:42:45.158 --> 01:42:46.260
chain is dependent on its

01:42:46.326 --> 01:42:47.694
downstream partners and their

01:42:47.761 --> 01:42:49.530
infrastructure to get an alert

01:42:49.596 --> 01:42:51.899
or warning out if there's one

01:42:51.965 --> 01:42:53.967
weak link in that chain the

01:42:54.034 --> 01:42:55.669
whole system can fall apart and

01:42:55.736 --> 01:42:56.637
the alerts and warnings will

01:42:56.703 --> 01:42:59.606
fail in order to be successful

01:42:59.907 --> 01:43:01.208
all of the aforementioned groups

01:43:01.275 --> 01:43:03.310
must be fully engaged properly

01:43:03.377 --> 01:43:05.312
trained have compatible gear

01:43:05.612 --> 01:43:06.780
and a willingness and ability to

01:43:06.847 --> 01:43:08.148
work together in a coordinated

01:43:08.215 --> 01:43:10.484
manner just getting these

01:43:10.551 --> 01:43:12.019
groups stick to the table can

01:43:12.085 --> 01:43:14.054
be difficult is one of my former

01:43:14.121 --> 01:43:15.422
coworkers put it coordinating

01:43:15.489 --> 01:43:17.357
this process is like extreme cat

01:43:17.424 --> 01:43:19.326
herding only worse I'd have to

01:43:19.393 --> 01:43:21.929
agree with them but despite

01:43:21.995 --> 01:43:23.430
these challenges we can and must

01:43:23.497 --> 01:43:25.732
succeed recent Senate simply

01:43:25.799 --> 01:43:26.967
bills in the state wide alert

01:43:27.034 --> 01:43:28.268
warning guidelines currently

01:43:28.335 --> 01:43:29.670
under development or takes steps

01:43:29.736 --> 01:43:31.939
in the right direction but more

01:43:32.005 --> 01:43:33.740
needs to be done a little later

01:43:33.807 --> 01:43:35.275
today -- the panel's going to

01:43:35.342 --> 01:43:36.643
be speaking about successful

01:43:36.710 --> 01:43:38.412
learning in the future hopefully

01:43:38.478 --> 01:43:39.746
I won't sealer their thunder

01:43:39.813 --> 01:43:41.982
by giving you all the details

01:43:42.449 --> 01:43:44.051
of their presentations but what

01:43:44.117 --> 01:43:45.319
I will say is that in order to

01:43:45.385 --> 01:43:47.554
be successful at a liberty --

01:43:47.621 --> 01:43:48.789
and implementing change on the

01:43:48.855 --> 01:43:50.791
ground now local governments

01:43:51.258 --> 01:43:52.693
need a simple procedure that

01:43:52.759 --> 01:43:54.061
provides clear guidance and

01:43:54.127 --> 01:43:55.362
takes as much of the guesswork

01:43:55.429 --> 01:43:56.563
out of the learning process

01:43:56.630 --> 01:43:58.532
as possible it should also

01:43:58.599 --> 01:44:00.100
leave enough flexibility so

01:44:00.167 --> 01:44:01.168
that each jurisdiction is

01:44:01.234 --> 01:44:02.936
able to develop specialized

01:44:03.003 --> 01:44:04.638
procedures that work for them

01:44:04.705 --> 01:44:05.639
based on their own unique

01:44:05.706 --> 01:44:07.975
operational needs demographics

01:44:08.041 --> 01:44:09.509
staffing levels and budgets

01:44:10.344 --> 01:44:11.578
any products or processes

01:44:11.645 --> 01:44:12.946
developed along these lines

01:44:13.280 --> 01:44:14.748
should bolster their efforts

01:44:14.815 --> 01:44:16.717
and operations not constrain

01:44:16.783 --> 01:44:19.019
them there also needs to be

01:44:19.086 --> 01:44:20.554
adequate support and funding

01:44:20.621 --> 01:44:21.888
to provide regular repeated

01:44:21.955 --> 01:44:23.290
training on a learning tools

01:44:23.957 --> 01:44:25.525
this is imperative because just

01:44:25.592 --> 01:44:27.094
like a firefighter paramedic

01:44:27.294 --> 01:44:28.495
trains to become proficient on

01:44:28.562 --> 01:44:29.997
a piece of life saving equipment

01:44:30.864 --> 01:44:32.299
agencies and officials tasked

01:44:32.366 --> 01:44:34.001
with alert warning you to train

01:44:34.067 --> 01:44:35.936
just as relentlessly on the

01:44:36.003 --> 01:44:37.237
use of their learning tools to

01:44:37.304 --> 01:44:38.472
be able to generate fast and

01:44:38.538 --> 01:44:40.207
effective public alerts warnings

01:44:41.141 --> 01:44:42.376
in Santa Barbara county armors

01:44:42.442 --> 01:44:43.744
sealer in protocols are based

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.846
on these principles we realize

01:44:45.912 --> 01:44:46.913
an array of alert morning

01:44:46.980 --> 01:44:48.315
tools with the goal of getting

01:44:48.615 --> 01:44:50.283
messages out early and often

01:44:50.350 --> 01:44:52.019
and as many formats as possible

01:44:52.953 --> 01:44:54.354
to help guide this process we've

01:44:54.421 --> 01:44:55.756
developed at your chart that

01:44:55.822 --> 01:44:57.090
provides clear direction as

01:44:57.157 --> 01:44:58.959
to which alerting tools to use

01:44:59.026 --> 01:45:00.527
and under what circumstances

01:45:00.994 --> 01:45:02.262
the chart allows us to quickly

01:45:02.329 --> 01:45:03.630
matches severity of a hazard --

01:45:03.697 --> 01:45:05.265
threat with a specific set of a

01:45:05.332 --> 01:45:07.567
learning tools the higher

01:45:07.634 --> 01:45:08.869
the urgency or more severe the

01:45:08.935 --> 01:45:10.303
threat the more learning tools

01:45:10.370 --> 01:45:12.606
we use to notify the public this

01:45:12.673 --> 01:45:13.840
speeds up the decision making

01:45:13.907 --> 01:45:15.776
process significantly and adds

01:45:15.842 --> 01:45:17.511
an element of consistency to

01:45:17.577 --> 01:45:19.146
an otherwise a radic process

01:45:19.613 --> 01:45:20.714
we've also developed easy to

01:45:20.781 --> 01:45:21.882
follow job Bates and fill in

01:45:21.948 --> 01:45:23.083
the blank message templates

01:45:23.150 --> 01:45:24.718
in English and Spanish that

01:45:24.785 --> 01:45:26.653
service work arounds for certain

01:45:26.720 --> 01:45:28.088
a learning tool limitations

01:45:28.155 --> 01:45:29.890
like character limits and

01:45:29.956 --> 01:45:31.291
help dispatchers get emergency

01:45:31.358 --> 01:45:33.527
information out quickly this

01:45:33.593 --> 01:45:34.895
simple model has been used

01:45:34.961 --> 01:45:36.296
during several recent real world

01:45:36.363 --> 01:45:37.831
incidents as and proven to be

01:45:37.898 --> 01:45:39.866
flexible scalable and effective

01:45:41.334 --> 01:45:42.335
in closing I just want to

01:45:42.402 --> 01:45:43.804
say that we have a unique

01:45:43.870 --> 01:45:45.072
opportunity here to get this

01:45:45.138 --> 01:45:47.074
right we have the will of

01:45:47.140 --> 01:45:48.475
our local representatives

01:45:48.542 --> 01:45:50.277
and emergency officials there

01:45:50.343 --> 01:45:51.611
stop the legislation on the

01:45:51.678 --> 01:45:53.613
books and the public is asking

01:45:53.680 --> 01:45:54.614
in no uncertain terms that

01:45:54.681 --> 01:45:56.750
we do better I believe we're

01:45:56.817 --> 01:45:58.085
up to this challenge and by

01:45:58.151 --> 01:45:59.419
continuing to work together

01:45:59.486 --> 01:46:01.488
we can get this job done thank

01:46:01.555 --> 01:46:02.556
you very much for your time

01:46:04.558 --> 01:46:06.226
and next we have Jeff

01:46:06.293 --> 01:46:07.728
Norris from San Mateo county

01:46:09.963 --> 01:46:11.198
so thank you very much for

01:46:11.264 --> 01:46:13.066
including me on this panel --

01:46:13.133 --> 01:46:15.602
San Matteo county is a resident

01:46:15.669 --> 01:46:16.870
population of seven hundred

01:46:16.937 --> 01:46:19.005
sixty thousand people were --

01:46:19.072 --> 01:46:21.041
located between San Francisco

01:46:21.108 --> 01:46:22.676
and Santa Clara and Santa Cruz

01:46:22.743 --> 01:46:23.977
counties so we're kind of the

01:46:24.044 --> 01:46:25.612
one reliable bridge between

01:46:25.679 --> 01:46:26.913
San Francisco and the rest of

01:46:26.980 --> 01:46:28.482
the nation which puts us in a

01:46:28.548 --> 01:46:31.017
unique position in that we are

01:46:31.084 --> 01:46:33.019
the support structure to San

01:46:33.086 --> 01:46:36.123
Francisco we have twenty cities

01:46:36.189 --> 01:46:37.224
that are incorporated within

01:46:37.290 --> 01:46:38.759
San Mateo county and we have

01:46:38.825 --> 01:46:40.160
our twenty first city which

01:46:40.227 --> 01:46:41.461
is San Francisco International

01:46:41.528 --> 01:46:43.230
Airport which is entirely in San

01:46:43.296 --> 01:46:45.999
Mateo county so we have a very

01:46:46.066 --> 01:46:48.602
diverse structure we have rural

01:46:48.668 --> 01:46:50.871
territories are coastal areas

01:46:50.937 --> 01:46:52.539
are in one mountain region

01:46:52.606 --> 01:46:54.341
and then we have extremely --

01:46:54.407 --> 01:46:56.676
high density urban areas along

01:46:56.743 --> 01:46:59.045
the bay side of we have towns

01:46:59.112 --> 01:47:01.148
that range from populations of

01:47:01.214 --> 01:47:02.682
a hundred and sixteen thousand

01:47:03.150 --> 01:47:05.385
to a population sixteen hundred

01:47:06.219 --> 01:47:08.388
so we have a great diversity a

01:47:08.455 --> 01:47:10.323
cemetery county is now on its

01:47:10.390 --> 01:47:12.526
third alert and warning system

01:47:12.793 --> 01:47:14.094
over the course of the last

01:47:14.161 --> 01:47:16.396
fifteen years we're currently

01:47:16.463 --> 01:47:17.697
-- using a system that has

01:47:17.764 --> 01:47:19.766
an integrated -- reverse nine

01:47:19.833 --> 01:47:21.768
one one as well as an opt in

01:47:21.835 --> 01:47:23.870
system were also using it for

01:47:23.937 --> 01:47:25.572
our health alerting system for

01:47:25.639 --> 01:47:26.706
our health department to be

01:47:26.773 --> 01:47:28.575
able to notify -- clinics and

01:47:28.642 --> 01:47:30.977
service providers so it's

01:47:31.044 --> 01:47:32.913
it's a very diverse as stuff --

01:47:32.979 --> 01:47:35.182
as such I've been tasked as

01:47:35.248 --> 01:47:37.184
the primary system administrator

01:47:37.450 --> 01:47:39.553
and consequently I'm into the

01:47:39.619 --> 01:47:41.087
hardware all the way down to

01:47:41.154 --> 01:47:42.823
the how to code a particular

01:47:42.889 --> 01:47:44.391
city or particular jurisdiction

01:47:44.457 --> 01:47:46.526
into the system -- with

01:47:46.593 --> 01:47:47.861
the support of our board of

01:47:47.928 --> 01:47:50.230
supervisors and -- champion by

01:47:50.297 --> 01:47:52.732
our supervisor David Canada --

01:47:52.799 --> 01:47:54.501
we were able to be the first

01:47:54.568 --> 01:47:57.003
to adopt a measure to pursue

01:47:57.404 --> 01:47:59.206
the additional information can

01:47:59.272 --> 01:48:01.408
be obtained under -- Senate

01:48:01.474 --> 01:48:02.976
bill eight twenty one and we

01:48:03.043 --> 01:48:05.078
greatly appreciate that --

01:48:05.145 --> 01:48:07.147
as such we're looking to our

01:48:07.214 --> 01:48:09.449
alternative sources we're not

01:48:09.516 --> 01:48:11.284
looking at obsolete in our

01:48:11.351 --> 01:48:12.919
opt in system because that

01:48:12.986 --> 01:48:14.688
is how we're always going to

01:48:15.555 --> 01:48:17.257
obtain individuals who otherwise

01:48:17.324 --> 01:48:18.625
aren't going to be in the system

01:48:18.692 --> 01:48:20.727
are traveling community our

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:23.163
student population individuals

01:48:23.230 --> 01:48:24.497
who may be passing through

01:48:24.564 --> 01:48:25.765
San Francisco International

01:48:25.832 --> 01:48:27.000
Airport -- to other parts of

01:48:27.067 --> 01:48:29.035
the county visiting relatives

01:48:29.903 --> 01:48:31.638
-- we already know that there

01:48:31.705 --> 01:48:32.772
are members who have opted

01:48:32.839 --> 01:48:34.374
into our system in other

01:48:34.441 --> 01:48:36.643
states and even other countries

01:48:36.843 --> 01:48:37.777
because they have relatives

01:48:37.844 --> 01:48:39.379
here and want to know what's

01:48:39.446 --> 01:48:40.780
happening they want to know

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:42.048
that our community is safe

01:48:42.682 --> 01:48:45.151
-- we look at the ability

01:48:45.218 --> 01:48:47.754
to obtain other data sources

01:48:47.821 --> 01:48:49.322
and we know that the biggest

01:48:49.522 --> 01:48:51.791
lack a gap in our data sources

01:48:52.092 --> 01:48:54.060
is voice over IP telephones

01:48:54.494 --> 01:48:56.863
they have superseded in many

01:48:56.930 --> 01:48:58.865
areas land lines and because

01:48:58.932 --> 01:49:00.200
of the topography of San Mateo

01:49:00.267 --> 01:49:01.401
county even though we have a

01:49:01.468 --> 01:49:03.103
large urban population we have

01:49:03.169 --> 01:49:04.471
a significant percentage who

01:49:04.537 --> 01:49:06.573
are in canyons where there is

01:49:06.640 --> 01:49:09.342
no cellular coverage at all

01:49:10.176 --> 01:49:12.679
-- regardless of care so

01:49:12.746 --> 01:49:14.047
we know that these individuals

01:49:14.114 --> 01:49:16.383
are still using a conventional

01:49:16.449 --> 01:49:17.851
land lines if they have a phone

01:49:17.918 --> 01:49:19.519
or they are using voice over

01:49:19.586 --> 01:49:21.588
IP phones -- so we're looking

01:49:21.655 --> 01:49:22.689
forward to the opportunity

01:49:22.756 --> 01:49:23.957
to how we can obtain those

01:49:24.024 --> 01:49:27.060
informations -- we don't look

01:49:27.127 --> 01:49:28.962
at these measures as obsolete

01:49:29.029 --> 01:49:31.364
in our opt in system we look

01:49:31.431 --> 01:49:33.166
at them as complementing and

01:49:33.233 --> 01:49:34.601
filling in the holes where

01:49:34.668 --> 01:49:37.037
our system currently lacks

01:49:37.237 --> 01:49:39.572
ability to contact people but

01:49:39.639 --> 01:49:41.675
as all my colleagues of stated

01:49:42.275 --> 01:49:44.577
all of these systems rely on

01:49:45.078 --> 01:49:48.081
robust ruggedized --

01:49:48.148 --> 01:49:49.883
technology to maintain these

01:49:49.950 --> 01:49:51.952
services and when something as

01:49:52.018 --> 01:49:53.720
simple as a single telephone

01:49:53.787 --> 01:49:56.156
pole falling over taking out

01:49:56.556 --> 01:49:58.458
a fiber optic cable can cut

01:49:58.525 --> 01:50:00.193
off and isolate an entire

01:50:00.260 --> 01:50:02.963
community -- that is really

01:50:03.029 --> 01:50:04.397
the circumstance in our county

01:50:04.464 --> 01:50:06.666
we've seen numerous landslides

01:50:06.933 --> 01:50:08.802
even a small landslides that

01:50:08.868 --> 01:50:10.236
were able to take out a single

01:50:10.303 --> 01:50:12.339
pole which in turn cut off

01:50:12.405 --> 01:50:13.707
communications for an entire

01:50:13.773 --> 01:50:16.443
community -- we continue to

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:18.078
look forward to how are other

01:50:18.144 --> 01:50:19.546
systems are other technologies

01:50:19.612 --> 01:50:20.981
are going to work on our behalf

01:50:21.314 --> 01:50:23.450
we -- were one of the early

01:50:23.516 --> 01:50:25.719
and -- applications for

01:50:25.785 --> 01:50:27.287
and I pause integrated public

01:50:27.354 --> 01:50:29.189
alert and warning system --

01:50:29.456 --> 01:50:32.058
agreement with -- FEMA we

01:50:32.125 --> 01:50:33.960
have had the good fortune of not

01:50:34.027 --> 01:50:36.496
needing to use it but we can't

01:50:36.563 --> 01:50:38.932
that tool available to us --

01:50:38.999 --> 01:50:41.534
we have studied and experimented

01:50:41.601 --> 01:50:43.636
with the -- training system so

01:50:43.703 --> 01:50:45.171
we understand the limitations

01:50:45.238 --> 01:50:46.573
of ninety characters we also

01:50:46.639 --> 01:50:48.208
understand the limitations of a

01:50:48.274 --> 01:50:50.510
one and done type message when

01:50:50.577 --> 01:50:52.679
a we a messages sent right now

01:50:53.146 --> 01:50:55.782
-- it is the next message

01:50:55.849 --> 01:50:57.484
that comes through it is gone

01:50:58.451 --> 01:51:00.420
that messages lost -- and

01:51:00.487 --> 01:51:01.488
also if you don't receive

01:51:01.554 --> 01:51:02.822
it on the first pass you

01:51:02.889 --> 01:51:04.624
will not receive it we've

01:51:04.691 --> 01:51:07.360
looked at how we have --

01:51:09.062 --> 01:51:10.530
the inability to know where

01:51:10.597 --> 01:51:13.266
towers are two right now --

01:51:13.333 --> 01:51:15.068
centralize our our location of

01:51:15.135 --> 01:51:16.803
are targeting and we understand

01:51:16.870 --> 01:51:19.572
how we a systems consistently

01:51:19.639 --> 01:51:21.574
will over alert or under alert

01:51:21.841 --> 01:51:24.577
because your coverage of towers

01:51:24.644 --> 01:51:26.312
varies dramatically and where

01:51:26.379 --> 01:51:28.214
they're located verses the --

01:51:28.281 --> 01:51:30.316
emergencies -- we certainly

01:51:30.383 --> 01:51:31.718
encountered that during the Glen

01:51:31.785 --> 01:51:34.020
view fire which was the -- gas

01:51:34.087 --> 01:51:35.889
pipeline explosion in San Bruno

01:51:36.322 --> 01:51:39.225
-- when our primary alert --

01:51:39.292 --> 01:51:41.528
covered most of the city of

01:51:41.594 --> 01:51:44.064
San Bruno but did not cover

01:51:44.264 --> 01:51:46.166
the affected area there

01:51:46.232 --> 01:51:47.400
was no technology left in

01:51:47.467 --> 01:51:48.701
the affected area it wasn't

01:51:48.768 --> 01:51:50.070
going to get a message anyway

01:51:50.937 --> 01:51:52.639
-- so we're we're looking

01:51:52.705 --> 01:51:54.040
forward to your assistance and

01:51:54.107 --> 01:51:56.576
particularly -- how the state

01:51:56.643 --> 01:51:58.511
can provide us with assistance

01:51:58.578 --> 01:52:00.680
templates guidelines that we can

01:52:00.747 --> 01:52:03.450
adopt and fit into our system

01:52:03.850 --> 01:52:05.051
we've looked at our language

01:52:05.118 --> 01:52:06.653
issue we've identified are for

01:52:06.719 --> 01:52:08.655
most common languages but we

01:52:08.721 --> 01:52:10.356
also have twenty five other

01:52:10.423 --> 01:52:13.326
languages that are less than

01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:15.895
half a percent in our population

01:52:15.962 --> 01:52:18.298
and we we're we're working

01:52:18.364 --> 01:52:19.866
at how we can reach the four

01:52:19.933 --> 01:52:21.968
most common languages knowing

01:52:22.035 --> 01:52:23.036
full well that that still

01:52:23.103 --> 01:52:24.904
leaves part of our community

01:52:25.772 --> 01:52:27.540
uncovered --

01:52:30.743 --> 01:52:32.011
so going forward

01:52:33.646 --> 01:52:34.881
we intend to utilize these

01:52:34.948 --> 01:52:36.516
opportunities to enhance our

01:52:36.583 --> 01:52:39.486
systems to build upon it --

01:52:39.752 --> 01:52:40.920
rather than to obsolete any

01:52:40.987 --> 01:52:42.188
section of it we intend to

01:52:42.255 --> 01:52:43.590
keep as much of are often as

01:52:43.656 --> 01:52:45.558
we possibly can to continue

01:52:45.625 --> 01:52:47.527
encouraging it -- right

01:52:47.594 --> 01:52:48.461
now we're sitting at about

01:52:48.528 --> 01:52:51.297
seventy two thousand options

01:52:51.764 --> 01:52:52.832
of our seven hundred sixty

01:52:52.899 --> 01:52:54.367
thousand population were about

01:52:54.434 --> 01:52:56.469
nine percent we're looking to

01:52:56.536 --> 01:52:58.037
try to make that number larger

01:52:58.438 --> 01:52:59.472
because we still view opt in

01:52:59.539 --> 01:53:00.807
is our best source for it for

01:53:00.874 --> 01:53:02.809
accurate information doesn't

01:53:02.876 --> 01:53:05.044
have to be de conflicted or --

01:53:05.445 --> 01:53:07.947
checked for accuracy or or --

01:53:08.548 --> 01:53:10.583
remote removal of duplications

01:53:11.951 --> 01:53:13.686
at any rate if -- if you have

01:53:13.753 --> 01:53:15.088
any questions I'd be more

01:53:15.155 --> 01:53:15.955
than happy to answer them

01:53:16.623 --> 01:53:18.825
thank you and I will start

01:53:18.892 --> 01:53:20.693
off -- with it just at

01:53:21.628 --> 01:53:22.795
asking a question all of you

01:53:22.862 --> 01:53:24.597
brought up language access and

01:53:25.165 --> 01:53:27.634
you know all of us here have

01:53:27.700 --> 01:53:29.469
been authors co authors and

01:53:29.536 --> 01:53:31.204
voted in support of a number of

01:53:31.271 --> 01:53:33.640
bills -- aging including one

01:53:33.706 --> 01:53:36.276
related to language I access

01:53:36.643 --> 01:53:38.811
and we share something in

01:53:38.878 --> 01:53:40.513
common with each of you that

01:53:40.580 --> 01:53:42.048
we put forward a tool which

01:53:42.115 --> 01:53:44.117
is our legislation to try to

01:53:44.184 --> 01:53:45.585
address an issue but certainly

01:53:45.652 --> 01:53:46.920
as you've all identified that

01:53:46.986 --> 01:53:49.422
tool doesn't solve every single

01:53:49.489 --> 01:53:51.090
problem right even one piece

01:53:51.157 --> 01:53:53.359
of legislation does not cover

01:53:53.560 --> 01:53:55.762
one the changing landscape on

01:53:55.828 --> 01:53:57.897
a bit too even the landscape

01:53:57.964 --> 01:54:00.466
as we understood it -- and

01:54:01.367 --> 01:54:03.102
if you have us here

01:54:03.670 --> 01:54:05.738
we're open to unending to

01:54:05.805 --> 01:54:07.807
changing to thinking forward

01:54:07.874 --> 01:54:09.375
thinking in terms of how how we

01:54:09.442 --> 01:54:11.010
address some of this issue but

01:54:11.077 --> 01:54:13.479
-- on the language axis issue

01:54:14.514 --> 01:54:16.649
I mean there's we

01:54:16.716 --> 01:54:17.650
knew from the beginning there

01:54:17.717 --> 01:54:19.352
was more than one language

01:54:19.419 --> 01:54:20.286
that was gonna be spoken

01:54:20.353 --> 01:54:22.322
right other than English we

01:54:22.388 --> 01:54:24.190
also identified that it was

01:54:24.257 --> 01:54:25.792
critical to get as many people

01:54:25.858 --> 01:54:27.360
informed because one and four

01:54:27.427 --> 01:54:29.629
percent -- could actually be

01:54:29.696 --> 01:54:31.631
not just a safety issue for

01:54:31.698 --> 01:54:33.266
him or herself but certainly

01:54:33.333 --> 01:54:35.201
for others as well so how do we

01:54:35.268 --> 01:54:37.070
think about that and and moving

01:54:37.136 --> 01:54:39.138
forward and I appreciate and

01:54:39.205 --> 01:54:40.907
the recognition that there are

01:54:40.974 --> 01:54:43.243
regional differences and there

01:54:43.309 --> 01:54:45.411
is difference in what capacity

01:54:45.478 --> 01:54:46.980
what cities and counties can or

01:54:47.046 --> 01:54:49.115
can't do you -- but how do we

01:54:49.182 --> 01:54:50.483
think about that moving forward

01:54:54.354 --> 01:54:56.356
I think it's a it's very

01:54:56.856 --> 01:54:58.258
taxing from a local government

01:54:58.324 --> 01:54:59.993
perspective to talk about

01:55:00.293 --> 01:55:03.162
mandating issuing public alert

01:55:03.229 --> 01:55:04.697
and warning messages in various

01:55:04.764 --> 01:55:05.798
languages and there should

01:55:05.865 --> 01:55:07.700
be a recognition of that --

01:55:07.767 --> 01:55:09.869
I have one staff member and

01:55:09.936 --> 01:55:12.238
I am well resource Ste a

01:55:12.305 --> 01:55:14.040
comparatively to other local

01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:16.376
-- jurisdictions I have twenty

01:55:16.442 --> 01:55:18.011
three staff and I have one staff

01:55:18.077 --> 01:55:20.446
person who speaks Spanish what

01:55:20.513 --> 01:55:22.582
we've done is we've recruited

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:25.585
county workers who are bilingual

01:55:26.686 --> 01:55:28.655
in they volunteer their time

01:55:28.721 --> 01:55:30.123
such that when we send out a

01:55:30.189 --> 01:55:32.058
public alert and warning if

01:55:32.125 --> 01:55:34.327
it's a weekend at you know

01:55:35.228 --> 01:55:37.563
o'clock on a Saturday night --

01:55:38.064 --> 01:55:40.633
they try men and translate for

01:55:40.700 --> 01:55:42.802
us it's completely voluntary

01:55:43.403 --> 01:55:44.837
-- when you talk about

01:55:44.904 --> 01:55:47.106
translating messages into

01:55:47.173 --> 01:55:49.142
multiple languages and only

01:55:49.208 --> 01:55:50.276
getting it out to the people

01:55:50.343 --> 01:55:51.644
its intent that it's intended

01:55:51.711 --> 01:55:54.013
for that that system doesn't

01:55:54.080 --> 01:55:56.049
exist so as the bill is written

01:55:56.115 --> 01:55:58.718
now we would need to send out

01:55:58.785 --> 01:56:00.920
a wireless emergency alert in

01:56:00.987 --> 01:56:03.856
English and as as the system

01:56:03.923 --> 01:56:05.925
exists today if I am targeting

01:56:05.992 --> 01:56:07.627
petco park in downtown San

01:56:07.694 --> 01:56:09.595
Diego that message is going to

01:56:09.662 --> 01:56:11.030
be received in my neighboring

01:56:11.097 --> 01:56:12.598
counties that's what happened

01:56:12.665 --> 01:56:14.400
last year it was received an

01:56:14.467 --> 01:56:15.668
Orange County in riverside

01:56:15.735 --> 01:56:16.903
county who called me and said

01:56:16.969 --> 01:56:18.838
stop learning my people and

01:56:18.905 --> 01:56:20.506
I said sorry it's the system

01:56:20.573 --> 01:56:21.741
I have no control over it

01:56:22.275 --> 01:56:23.676
but I will be sending out

01:56:23.743 --> 01:56:25.845
an alert in English reaching

01:56:25.912 --> 01:56:27.914
millions of people I will

01:56:27.980 --> 01:56:29.649
then by law now follow that

01:56:29.716 --> 01:56:31.317
up with a message to all of

01:56:31.384 --> 01:56:32.919
those same people in Spanish

01:56:34.053 --> 01:56:36.456
and my fear and my concern

01:56:36.923 --> 01:56:38.624
is that people immediately

01:56:38.691 --> 01:56:40.326
go already got that I don't

01:56:40.393 --> 01:56:41.594
understand this language and

01:56:41.661 --> 01:56:43.463
they go in and they turn off

01:56:44.163 --> 01:56:45.465
the wireless emergency alerts

01:56:45.531 --> 01:56:47.266
because they're able to opt out

01:56:47.600 --> 01:56:49.235
of wireless emergency alerts and

01:56:49.302 --> 01:56:50.403
less it's and by the president

01:56:50.470 --> 01:56:52.038
they can opt out of my messaging

01:56:52.438 --> 01:56:53.439
and next time when I need to

01:56:53.506 --> 01:56:54.807
reach them I won't be able to

01:56:55.074 --> 01:56:56.409
so that's the laws it's written

01:56:56.476 --> 01:56:57.810
now is if I send out an English

01:56:57.877 --> 01:57:00.446
alert it it's not geo targeted

01:57:00.513 --> 01:57:01.748
right now so it there's another

01:57:01.814 --> 01:57:04.517
year before that goes into

01:57:04.584 --> 01:57:06.753
place -- at the end of twenty

01:57:06.819 --> 01:57:07.987
nineteen the system will be

01:57:08.054 --> 01:57:09.255
improved that will allow for a

01:57:09.322 --> 01:57:10.823
tenth of a mile geo targeting

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:12.058
that's not the case now there's

01:57:12.125 --> 01:57:14.794
mass over -- sort of a

01:57:14.861 --> 01:57:17.330
learning in the system so

01:57:17.530 --> 01:57:19.232
that's the that's the are

01:57:19.298 --> 01:57:20.700
concerned from my standpoint

01:57:22.935 --> 01:57:24.303
so beyond that even when we

01:57:24.370 --> 01:57:26.205
do get this new advanced geo

01:57:26.272 --> 01:57:27.473
targeting to one tenth of a

01:57:27.540 --> 01:57:29.375
mile and the expansion from

01:57:29.442 --> 01:57:31.344
ninety characters to two hundred

01:57:31.411 --> 01:57:33.446
forty or three hundred sixty --

01:57:33.513 --> 01:57:36.549
depending upon which a proposal

01:57:36.616 --> 01:57:37.784
-- for rule making for the

01:57:37.850 --> 01:57:40.520
SEC read even then

01:57:40.853 --> 01:57:43.523
much of the telephone hardware

01:57:43.589 --> 01:57:44.791
the actual handsets that

01:57:44.857 --> 01:57:47.193
individuals have are not capable

01:57:47.260 --> 01:57:48.861
of receiving them still and

01:57:48.928 --> 01:57:51.130
it's going to take a obsolete

01:57:51.197 --> 01:57:52.999
in time period while people

01:57:53.065 --> 01:57:55.168
are returning older equipment

01:57:55.234 --> 01:57:56.135
getting newer equipment

01:57:56.202 --> 01:57:57.336
that's capable of receiving

01:57:57.403 --> 01:57:59.539
these messages -- we actually

01:57:59.605 --> 01:58:01.240
encountered this problem when we

01:58:01.307 --> 01:58:03.910
were having a issue with a levy

01:58:04.510 --> 01:58:06.646
-- I have the luxury of being

01:58:06.712 --> 01:58:09.115
able to -- call to an adjacent

01:58:09.182 --> 01:58:11.717
agency in my -- my sheriff's

01:58:11.784 --> 01:58:14.420
office and I ask for the most

01:58:14.487 --> 01:58:16.289
fluent Spanish speaking person

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:17.990
who works in the jail he can

01:58:18.057 --> 01:58:19.826
be over in my building in about

01:58:19.892 --> 01:58:22.195
three minutes four minutes and I

01:58:22.261 --> 01:58:23.729
use him to translate for him or

01:58:23.796 --> 01:58:25.665
her -- to translate the message

01:58:25.731 --> 01:58:27.934
for me we did this for a levy

01:58:28.000 --> 01:58:30.770
issue and we discovered

01:58:30.837 --> 01:58:33.139
our older technology did not

01:58:33.206 --> 01:58:35.508
recognize answering machines we

01:58:35.575 --> 01:58:37.043
fielded hundreds of complaint

01:58:37.109 --> 01:58:38.945
phone calls -- from individuals

01:58:39.011 --> 01:58:40.279
who say they only receive the

01:58:40.346 --> 01:58:42.615
message in Spanish because when

01:58:42.682 --> 01:58:44.016
the sense system sense that the

01:58:44.083 --> 01:58:45.451
phone had picked up its start

01:58:45.518 --> 01:58:46.886
playing the English message by

01:58:46.953 --> 01:58:48.754
the time it started recording

01:58:48.955 --> 01:58:50.089
it recorded the Spanish

01:58:50.156 --> 01:58:52.658
message there are technology

01:58:52.725 --> 01:58:55.261
to our current system detects

01:58:55.461 --> 01:58:57.330
a tone and starts the message

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:59.365
over again -- but there are

01:58:59.432 --> 01:59:01.901
technology issues that will

01:59:01.968 --> 01:59:04.504
make a multi lingual multi

01:59:04.570 --> 01:59:06.506
language -- notification very

01:59:06.572 --> 01:59:08.207
difficult and we're attempting

01:59:08.274 --> 01:59:09.742
to overcome this past weekend

01:59:10.276 --> 01:59:12.378
-- literally our best option

01:59:12.645 --> 01:59:14.714
in this is our often systems

01:59:15.014 --> 01:59:17.383
some of which are working now

01:59:17.450 --> 01:59:19.185
with experimental systems where

01:59:19.252 --> 01:59:20.987
users can select the language

01:59:21.053 --> 01:59:22.522
they want us to receive a

01:59:22.588 --> 01:59:24.190
language and we're actually

01:59:24.257 --> 01:59:25.925
testing some prototype software

01:59:25.992 --> 01:59:28.561
that'll do that it's not ready

01:59:28.628 --> 01:59:30.696
for general public use but it

01:59:30.763 --> 01:59:32.398
certainly has great promise

01:59:33.232 --> 01:59:35.434
thank you and I appreciate to

01:59:35.501 --> 01:59:38.170
a you know the comments and and

01:59:38.404 --> 01:59:40.139
the concern about over tax seen

01:59:40.206 --> 01:59:42.608
counties and certainly when we

01:59:42.675 --> 01:59:44.310
move forward legislation it's

01:59:44.377 --> 01:59:46.045
not with the intent to over tax

01:59:46.112 --> 01:59:47.813
counties but it's also comes

01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:48.981
from especially the language

01:59:49.048 --> 01:59:50.383
issue came from multiple

01:59:50.449 --> 01:59:52.184
counties having this issue

01:59:52.518 --> 01:59:55.555
-- and multiple counties --

01:59:55.955 --> 01:59:58.958
at right having real challenges

01:59:59.025 --> 02:00:00.359
in in translation I mean the

02:00:00.426 --> 02:00:02.395
examples we were getting --

02:00:02.461 --> 02:00:04.030
were probably not refax it did

02:00:04.096 --> 02:00:05.431
reflective of the fact that

02:00:05.498 --> 02:00:07.333
you know so much of technology

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:09.969
started in California -- and

02:00:10.036 --> 02:00:11.537
-- we're doing very basic

02:00:11.604 --> 02:00:14.106
translations that not only are

02:00:14.173 --> 02:00:15.975
wrong but are putting people

02:00:16.042 --> 02:00:18.077
in more danger that causes a

02:00:18.144 --> 02:00:20.046
concerned I'm not a one time

02:00:20.112 --> 02:00:21.447
thing but a repeated thing

02:00:21.514 --> 02:00:23.783
a for counties -- and what

02:00:23.849 --> 02:00:26.519
I am also looking for is

02:00:27.420 --> 02:00:29.121
when it when we have a state a

02:00:29.188 --> 02:00:30.356
California one more than forty

02:00:30.423 --> 02:00:32.158
four percent of California speak

02:00:32.224 --> 02:00:33.659
a language other than home than

02:00:33.726 --> 02:00:36.062
English at home -- you know

02:00:36.128 --> 02:00:38.064
how how we get there it sounds

02:00:38.130 --> 02:00:40.700
like working with our partners

02:00:40.766 --> 02:00:42.602
in tech -- I know several of

02:00:42.668 --> 02:00:44.637
us that have been working with

02:00:44.704 --> 02:00:46.906
them to try to identify how

02:00:46.973 --> 02:00:48.841
we I mean the geo targeting is

02:00:48.908 --> 02:00:51.310
very important -- certainly but

02:00:51.377 --> 02:00:53.846
also how to make some

02:00:53.913 --> 02:00:55.181
determinations to be more

02:00:55.247 --> 02:00:57.717
specific -- and more targeted

02:00:57.984 --> 02:00:59.785
in what message were trying to

02:00:59.852 --> 02:01:01.587
get out to what constituency

02:01:01.821 --> 02:01:02.955
-- the goal is certainly

02:01:03.022 --> 02:01:04.690
not for people to opt out

02:01:04.924 --> 02:01:07.126
-- and I I thought that the

02:01:07.193 --> 02:01:08.561
previous panel also said

02:01:08.628 --> 02:01:10.796
that you know that there's

02:01:10.863 --> 02:01:13.165
a mixed review on on whether

02:01:14.200 --> 02:01:16.469
too much information one is and

02:01:16.535 --> 02:01:18.671
what it really does -- it does

02:01:18.738 --> 02:01:20.840
it really you know concerned

02:01:20.906 --> 02:01:22.508
folks or are not concerned

02:01:22.575 --> 02:01:23.542
make it sounds like there's

02:01:23.609 --> 02:01:25.277
different schools of thought --

02:01:25.344 --> 02:01:27.680
on what that does so and again I

02:01:27.747 --> 02:01:29.048
appreciate the comments and and

02:01:29.115 --> 02:01:30.516
I look forward to hearing what

02:01:30.850 --> 02:01:32.718
what pieces we need to change

02:01:32.952 --> 02:01:34.987
so that you can be effective --

02:01:35.054 --> 02:01:37.023
in really doing what you're you

02:01:37.089 --> 02:01:38.491
know what you're responsible for

02:01:38.557 --> 02:01:39.992
doing what the county level but

02:01:40.059 --> 02:01:41.627
also so we can get information

02:01:41.694 --> 02:01:43.095
out to Californians because

02:01:43.162 --> 02:01:45.598
that is something we hear about

02:01:45.665 --> 02:01:47.266
on a very regular basis how

02:01:47.333 --> 02:01:48.834
many during emergencies that

02:01:48.901 --> 02:01:50.703
they want accurate information

02:01:50.936 --> 02:01:53.239
-- and that's the that rises

02:01:53.305 --> 02:01:54.907
to the top so think you

02:01:55.741 --> 02:01:58.044
and assemblymember Levine --

02:02:00.112 --> 02:02:00.780
thanks very much for your

02:02:00.846 --> 02:02:02.048
presentation default on a very

02:02:02.114 --> 02:02:04.016
good job to demystify a little

02:02:04.083 --> 02:02:04.917
bit about the work that you

02:02:04.984 --> 02:02:07.286
do and and -- deals with

02:02:07.353 --> 02:02:08.587
perceptions of the emergency

02:02:08.654 --> 02:02:09.689
alerts which I think a lot of

02:02:09.755 --> 02:02:11.157
Californians have concerns and

02:02:11.223 --> 02:02:13.526
questions about you all have

02:02:13.592 --> 02:02:15.127
different size communities and

02:02:15.194 --> 02:02:17.029
therefore different size offices

02:02:17.096 --> 02:02:19.231
to respond to disasters in your

02:02:19.298 --> 02:02:22.068
communities and let's have

02:02:22.134 --> 02:02:23.769
some practical questions about

02:02:23.836 --> 02:02:26.405
how alerts work for your offices

02:02:26.906 --> 02:02:28.474
and they're not I don't I don't

02:02:28.541 --> 02:02:29.742
mean to have any suggestions

02:02:29.809 --> 02:02:30.876
the overly prescriptive because

02:02:30.943 --> 02:02:32.978
of the differences but --

02:02:33.612 --> 02:02:35.748
is there specialized software or

02:02:35.815 --> 02:02:38.617
hardware used to do these alerts

02:02:38.684 --> 02:02:40.319
or is this something that's a

02:02:40.386 --> 02:02:41.587
web based apps that could be

02:02:41.654 --> 02:02:43.289
used on a tablet or computer

02:02:43.355 --> 02:02:45.725
from any location I also

02:02:45.791 --> 02:02:48.194
am curious about how many staff

02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:50.463
have this training in your

02:02:50.529 --> 02:02:53.199
offices and also whether there's

02:02:53.265 --> 02:02:54.667
any requirement for the staff

02:02:54.734 --> 02:02:56.936
that is trained to be on or on

02:02:57.002 --> 02:02:59.739
call and able to do these alerts

02:02:59.972 --> 02:03:01.340
in your communities thank you

02:03:04.710 --> 02:03:06.045
in Santa Barbara county and

02:03:06.112 --> 02:03:07.646
we work in tandem with our a

02:03:07.713 --> 02:03:09.515
sheriff's dispatch center --

02:03:09.582 --> 02:03:10.816
they have dispatchers on twenty

02:03:10.883 --> 02:03:12.118
four seven where is the office

02:03:12.184 --> 02:03:13.953
of emergency management we work

02:03:14.019 --> 02:03:15.421
beyond normal business hours and

02:03:15.488 --> 02:03:16.956
we have a duty officer coverage

02:03:17.256 --> 02:03:19.358
-- but for instance I might be

02:03:19.425 --> 02:03:20.459
driving down the freeway in my

02:03:20.526 --> 02:03:21.927
vehicle and if I were to get a

02:03:21.994 --> 02:03:23.262
call to send out alert I would

02:03:23.329 --> 02:03:24.864
have to pull over turn my hot

02:03:24.930 --> 02:03:26.732
spot log in my computer log

02:03:26.799 --> 02:03:28.400
into the system craft a message

02:03:28.467 --> 02:03:30.069
sent out the alert it's far from

02:03:30.136 --> 02:03:32.037
ideal especially with rapidly

02:03:32.104 --> 02:03:33.806
developing -- emergencies

02:03:33.873 --> 02:03:35.174
like a fast moving wildfire

02:03:35.241 --> 02:03:37.510
something to that effect so

02:03:38.043 --> 02:03:39.011
in Santa Barbara county the

02:03:39.078 --> 02:03:40.579
dispatch center is is really

02:03:40.646 --> 02:03:42.548
key as a twenty four hour --

02:03:42.615 --> 02:03:43.983
warning point for the community

02:03:44.350 --> 02:03:46.252
so were working very hard to

02:03:46.318 --> 02:03:47.186
make sure that all of those

02:03:47.253 --> 02:03:48.254
dispatchers are trained to

02:03:48.320 --> 02:03:49.822
become proficient in the system

02:03:50.055 --> 02:03:51.123
so that they can get the alerts

02:03:51.190 --> 02:03:52.424
out as quickly as possible

02:03:55.728 --> 02:03:57.530
any type of computer device or

02:03:57.596 --> 02:03:59.098
or does it have to be special

02:03:59.165 --> 02:04:01.167
dedicated hardware software so

02:04:01.233 --> 02:04:02.935
it can be done on any device

02:04:03.002 --> 02:04:04.303
including a phone -- from

02:04:04.370 --> 02:04:05.571
my personal experience I I

02:04:05.638 --> 02:04:06.739
don't recommend doing it from

02:04:06.806 --> 02:04:07.973
your phone -- there's some

02:04:08.040 --> 02:04:09.141
challenges associated with

02:04:09.208 --> 02:04:10.576
that -- but they can log in

02:04:10.643 --> 02:04:12.678
anywhere in our office -- for

02:04:12.745 --> 02:04:14.780
a period of time I did a lot

02:04:14.847 --> 02:04:16.081
of the initial learning and

02:04:16.148 --> 02:04:17.616
our our protocols of shifted

02:04:17.683 --> 02:04:18.717
to wear the dispatch center

02:04:18.784 --> 02:04:19.885
is doing the initial learning

02:04:20.219 --> 02:04:21.287
and we will follow up with

02:04:21.353 --> 02:04:22.822
that or if for some reason to

02:04:22.888 --> 02:04:24.323
dispatch centers over one which

02:04:24.390 --> 02:04:25.658
happens quite frequently when

02:04:25.724 --> 02:04:27.259
alerts go out people me more

02:04:27.326 --> 02:04:28.394
information they call my will

02:04:28.460 --> 02:04:29.628
want to get that information

02:04:29.695 --> 02:04:31.831
unfortunately -- then we we will

02:04:31.897 --> 02:04:33.966
assess and by doing that -- in

02:04:34.033 --> 02:04:36.035
those cases like I described

02:04:36.101 --> 02:04:37.469
we will pull over from our

02:04:37.536 --> 02:04:39.471
vehicles and log in and --

02:04:39.538 --> 02:04:40.673
if we're not in the office or

02:04:40.739 --> 02:04:41.974
something like that and we are

02:04:42.041 --> 02:04:44.009
available twenty four seven to

02:04:44.076 --> 02:04:45.544
do that and we have done that

02:04:45.611 --> 02:04:46.779
numerous times in the past

02:04:50.683 --> 02:04:51.784
twenty county has a very

02:04:51.851 --> 02:04:53.886
similar scenario -- our office

02:04:53.953 --> 02:04:55.421
of emergency services has one

02:04:55.487 --> 02:04:58.257
FTA and he said right here --

02:04:58.924 --> 02:05:00.759
so twenty four hour coverages

02:05:00.826 --> 02:05:02.661
it is difficult for that it

02:05:02.728 --> 02:05:04.396
is so our emergency alerts

02:05:04.463 --> 02:05:05.464
are done through a sheriff's

02:05:05.531 --> 02:05:07.600
dispatch I previously

02:05:07.666 --> 02:05:08.434
mentioned I can be done for

02:05:08.500 --> 02:05:10.769
many computer -- utilizing

02:05:10.836 --> 02:05:12.905
the ever raging iPod systems

02:05:17.743 --> 02:05:19.245
I would just say ditto at the

02:05:19.311 --> 02:05:21.146
same exact thing -- in the

02:05:21.213 --> 02:05:22.448
two thousand and seven fires

02:05:22.514 --> 02:05:23.782
San Diego county evacuated

02:05:23.849 --> 02:05:24.683
five hundred and fifteen

02:05:24.750 --> 02:05:26.418
thousand people as a result

02:05:26.485 --> 02:05:28.120
of those fires and our staff

02:05:28.187 --> 02:05:28.988
the office of emergency

02:05:29.054 --> 02:05:30.756
services very much back up

02:05:30.823 --> 02:05:31.891
to the sheriff's dispatch

02:05:31.957 --> 02:05:33.459
initiating a public late

02:05:33.525 --> 02:05:35.094
morning evacuation campaigns

02:05:38.364 --> 02:05:39.565
senator counties taken a

02:05:39.632 --> 02:05:40.900
slightly different approach

02:05:41.166 --> 02:05:42.935
some of our dispatch centers

02:05:43.002 --> 02:05:44.203
for our twenty incorporated

02:05:44.270 --> 02:05:46.272
cities do do the notifications

02:05:46.338 --> 02:05:48.440
for the agencies other agencies

02:05:48.507 --> 02:05:50.509
contact the office of emergency

02:05:50.576 --> 02:05:52.444
services to do our notifications

02:05:53.045 --> 02:05:55.547
-- we maintain a two

02:05:55.614 --> 02:05:58.250
on duty officer status one

02:05:58.317 --> 02:06:00.552
emergency manager and one deputy

02:06:00.619 --> 02:06:01.854
sheriff for one -- sure of

02:06:01.921 --> 02:06:04.056
sergeant so we always have to

02:06:04.123 --> 02:06:05.824
people available at any given

02:06:05.891 --> 02:06:08.193
time with sending capability but

02:06:08.260 --> 02:06:10.562
we've also extended our message

02:06:10.629 --> 02:06:13.265
origination capability out to

02:06:13.532 --> 02:06:15.768
-- some supervisors in some

02:06:15.834 --> 02:06:17.169
of our agencies some of our

02:06:17.236 --> 02:06:18.504
wonderful partner agencies

02:06:18.570 --> 02:06:19.838
like the highway patrol some of

02:06:19.905 --> 02:06:21.206
their sergeants have the ability

02:06:21.273 --> 02:06:23.609
to put messages out and arm

02:06:23.676 --> 02:06:25.411
our software similarly can be a

02:06:25.477 --> 02:06:28.080
have accessed from anything

02:06:28.147 --> 02:06:30.082
including a mobile app --

02:06:30.149 --> 02:06:32.217
but we've actually -- made it

02:06:32.718 --> 02:06:35.187
configured things so that our

02:06:35.254 --> 02:06:36.722
software can be operated from

02:06:36.789 --> 02:06:38.557
the mobile data terminals that

02:06:38.624 --> 02:06:39.992
you'll find in most police cars

02:06:40.059 --> 02:06:42.194
most of our fire engines so a

02:06:42.261 --> 02:06:44.096
fire battalion chief on scene

02:06:44.330 --> 02:06:45.798
if he decides he wants a shelter

02:06:45.864 --> 02:06:47.666
in place he can put that message

02:06:47.733 --> 02:06:48.968
out right there from the back of

02:06:49.034 --> 02:06:50.569
his -- battalion chief vehicle

02:06:55.774 --> 02:06:57.977
thank you -- you

02:06:58.043 --> 02:06:59.745
know all this testimony just

02:06:59.812 --> 02:07:01.613
confirms the fact that there is

02:07:01.680 --> 02:07:04.049
no one way to solve this problem

02:07:04.516 --> 02:07:06.652
but I'd like to focus on the

02:07:07.019 --> 02:07:09.288
-- opt to the issues

02:07:09.355 --> 02:07:11.357
of that I try to resolve in the

02:07:11.423 --> 02:07:13.025
legislation that that we've been

02:07:13.092 --> 02:07:15.260
referring to my legislation on

02:07:15.728 --> 02:07:18.097
opting requiring an opt out

02:07:18.998 --> 02:07:20.933
in requiring that people are

02:07:21.000 --> 02:07:22.768
included in the notifications

02:07:22.835 --> 02:07:24.036
unless they don't want to be

02:07:24.670 --> 02:07:26.505
-- because we have seen that

02:07:26.572 --> 02:07:28.974
there are very few people OB

02:07:29.241 --> 02:07:30.776
I don't know whether we should

02:07:30.843 --> 02:07:32.077
have voted taken the taco

02:07:32.144 --> 02:07:33.846
approach Xin often talk a list

02:07:33.912 --> 02:07:35.848
everyone but we're getting

02:07:35.914 --> 02:07:37.416
people to opt into the system

02:07:37.483 --> 02:07:39.952
has not been as successful as

02:07:40.019 --> 02:07:41.186
we would like even after the

02:07:41.253 --> 02:07:43.856
Thomas fire we discovered of

02:07:43.922 --> 02:07:45.858
very few people that we seat

02:07:45.924 --> 02:07:47.192
we did see a little spike in

02:07:47.259 --> 02:07:48.160
some of the areas that were

02:07:48.227 --> 02:07:50.462
most directly affected but

02:07:50.529 --> 02:07:52.131
not throughout the county --

02:07:52.197 --> 02:07:54.333
counties as a whole -- and

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:56.635
this is a first line of defense

02:07:57.069 --> 02:07:59.171
so the legislation that -- that

02:07:59.238 --> 02:08:00.973
I introduced was passed does

02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:03.842
-- allow counties gives them

02:08:03.909 --> 02:08:05.978
the discretion to create

02:08:06.045 --> 02:08:08.614
an opt out program everyone

02:08:08.881 --> 02:08:10.849
by requiring that are utility

02:08:10.916 --> 02:08:12.418
companies will share their

02:08:12.484 --> 02:08:14.186
information about where people

02:08:14.253 --> 02:08:15.554
live with their phone numbers

02:08:15.621 --> 02:08:17.022
are whether it's wireless her

02:08:17.389 --> 02:08:19.058
lan line and put that into

02:08:19.124 --> 02:08:20.893
the system then giving people

02:08:20.959 --> 02:08:22.428
the right to opt out if they

02:08:22.494 --> 02:08:23.962
don't want the notifications

02:08:24.229 --> 02:08:25.764
my suspicion is a people

02:08:26.432 --> 02:08:27.866
the ark and do anything and so

02:08:27.933 --> 02:08:29.068
they'll have been opted into

02:08:29.134 --> 02:08:31.236
the program which is a plus

02:08:31.303 --> 02:08:32.604
but as you say when people

02:08:32.671 --> 02:08:34.039
voluntarily often they can

02:08:34.106 --> 02:08:35.908
tell you where they live the

02:08:35.974 --> 02:08:37.209
language that they prefer to

02:08:37.276 --> 02:08:38.677
get notifications clearly a

02:08:38.744 --> 02:08:40.646
better approach but not one that

02:08:40.712 --> 02:08:42.614
seems to have been as effective

02:08:43.515 --> 02:08:46.118
so it's a system that allows

02:08:46.185 --> 02:08:47.853
discretion within each county

02:08:48.353 --> 02:08:50.422
and I'm curious -- because I'd

02:08:50.489 --> 02:08:51.690
like to see every county do

02:08:51.757 --> 02:08:53.859
this -- I just think it will

02:08:53.926 --> 02:08:56.095
help save lives and give people

02:08:56.161 --> 02:08:58.497
notice assuming that the systems

02:08:58.564 --> 02:09:00.499
don't go down you know that we

02:09:00.566 --> 02:09:01.867
don't lose sell power will all

02:09:01.934 --> 02:09:03.469
the other options but assuming

02:09:03.535 --> 02:09:05.604
that the system is in place it

02:09:05.671 --> 02:09:08.040
will give notice to people and

02:09:08.107 --> 02:09:09.241
that's one of the things we

02:09:09.308 --> 02:09:11.176
want to do could you share with

02:09:11.243 --> 02:09:13.946
me about whether you are using

02:09:14.012 --> 02:09:15.814
that system wanna use that

02:09:15.881 --> 02:09:18.550
system -- what the impediments

02:09:18.617 --> 02:09:21.053
are because nothing's perfect

02:09:21.120 --> 02:09:22.921
and I don't think I was able

02:09:22.988 --> 02:09:24.189
to anticipate all of the

02:09:24.423 --> 02:09:26.725
concerns -- and just generally

02:09:26.792 --> 02:09:28.427
where you and your counties

02:09:28.494 --> 02:09:30.996
or cities said in terms of

02:09:31.330 --> 02:09:33.265
implementing this discretionary

02:09:33.332 --> 02:09:35.367
programs that that does have

02:09:35.434 --> 02:09:36.969
those parameters to it that

02:09:37.035 --> 02:09:39.338
-- are under SB twenty one

02:09:42.774 --> 02:09:44.109
so in summary county we're

02:09:44.176 --> 02:09:45.978
working with to local utilities

02:09:46.044 --> 02:09:47.279
on the south coast because that

02:09:47.346 --> 02:09:48.714
area was most impacted by the

02:09:48.780 --> 02:09:50.749
recent emergencies -- and what

02:09:50.816 --> 02:09:51.884
we're trying to do right now

02:09:51.950 --> 02:09:53.452
is we're trying to identify the

02:09:53.519 --> 02:09:55.287
type of data that they have how

02:09:55.354 --> 02:09:56.955
we can configure it to be able

02:09:57.022 --> 02:09:58.190
to upload it into our mercy

02:09:58.257 --> 02:10:00.959
notification system at some

02:10:01.026 --> 02:10:02.794
of the concerns about the data

02:10:03.095 --> 02:10:05.497
are that -- some of the

02:10:05.564 --> 02:10:07.533
data can be quite old -- when

02:10:07.599 --> 02:10:09.468
she tell the information -- it

02:10:09.535 --> 02:10:11.270
also can be incomplete ideally

02:10:11.336 --> 02:10:12.704
what we want to have is one have

02:10:12.771 --> 02:10:14.640
a person's name their current

02:10:14.706 --> 02:10:17.042
address your email address

02:10:17.609 --> 02:10:18.810
-- you know their cell phone

02:10:18.877 --> 02:10:20.179
number so they can receive text

02:10:20.245 --> 02:10:22.047
alerts voice calls their lan

02:10:22.114 --> 02:10:23.916
line number -- and so on and

02:10:23.982 --> 02:10:25.751
so on and so on -- the utility

02:10:25.817 --> 02:10:27.119
company so far that we spoke

02:10:27.186 --> 02:10:28.587
with have some of that data but

02:10:28.654 --> 02:10:30.622
not all of it so being able to

02:10:30.689 --> 02:10:31.957
piece it all together in a way

02:10:32.024 --> 02:10:33.292
that that makes sense so that

02:10:33.358 --> 02:10:34.927
they can get those alerts as

02:10:34.993 --> 02:10:36.428
quickly as possible checks in

02:10:36.495 --> 02:10:38.030
the mail being the fastest route

02:10:38.330 --> 02:10:39.965
to getting information it is

02:10:40.032 --> 02:10:41.300
what we're trying to accomplish

02:10:41.633 --> 02:10:43.969
-- our vendor ever bridge --

02:10:44.036 --> 02:10:45.537
-- is very confident that I

02:10:45.604 --> 02:10:47.039
can be done easily and like a

02:10:47.105 --> 02:10:48.807
server using those two utilities

02:10:48.874 --> 02:10:50.142
on the south coast as our test

02:10:50.209 --> 02:10:52.077
cases for this and are deadline

02:10:52.144 --> 02:10:53.345
for that to kind of have in

02:10:53.412 --> 02:10:54.513
place and see how it works is

02:10:54.580 --> 02:10:56.782
gonna be January first not soon

02:10:56.848 --> 02:10:59.184
enough but you know we are --

02:10:59.251 --> 02:11:00.586
trying to do this in a way that

02:11:00.652 --> 02:11:03.121
-- it doesn't aye hamstring

02:11:03.188 --> 02:11:05.357
our local utilities -- anymore

02:11:05.424 --> 02:11:07.025
than we have to -- but we're

02:11:07.092 --> 02:11:08.527
also there's a sense of urgency

02:11:08.594 --> 02:11:10.362
right maybe storm predicted for

02:11:10.429 --> 02:11:11.964
tomorrow you know and we could

02:11:12.030 --> 02:11:13.565
be utilized in information --

02:11:13.632 --> 02:11:14.933
but I feel very confident based

02:11:15.000 --> 02:11:16.868
on what our vendors is told us

02:11:16.935 --> 02:11:18.337
and then also about the ability

02:11:18.403 --> 02:11:19.805
to provide an easy opt out for

02:11:19.871 --> 02:11:22.074
the public thank you

02:11:24.376 --> 02:11:25.777
working with that same software

02:11:25.844 --> 02:11:28.447
platform and with one of our

02:11:28.513 --> 02:11:31.216
cities being its own cable TV

02:11:31.283 --> 02:11:33.151
and voice over IP phone provider

02:11:33.418 --> 02:11:35.254
they actually voluntarily came

02:11:35.320 --> 02:11:37.289
to us and said how do we get our

02:11:37.356 --> 02:11:39.858
data into your system so we

02:11:39.925 --> 02:11:41.793
actually have a test set of

02:11:41.860 --> 02:11:43.695
about twenty thousand customers

02:11:43.762 --> 02:11:44.896
that we're actually working

02:11:44.963 --> 02:11:46.498
with how we will manipulate the

02:11:46.565 --> 02:11:48.033
data how we will get it to fit

02:11:48.100 --> 02:11:50.135
into the template how we will

02:11:50.202 --> 02:11:52.704
de conflicted with our existing

02:11:53.005 --> 02:11:54.973
-- reversed nine one one data

02:11:55.240 --> 02:11:56.875
so that we don't end up having

02:11:57.242 --> 02:11:59.678
-- two simultaneous calls trying

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:01.847
to originate -- which ties

02:12:01.913 --> 02:12:04.416
up dial tone -- which will

02:12:04.483 --> 02:12:06.418
be violations short in a large

02:12:06.485 --> 02:12:08.553
scale emergency so we're we're

02:12:08.620 --> 02:12:09.888
working with the same thing

02:12:09.955 --> 02:12:11.390
we're anticipating being able

02:12:11.456 --> 02:12:14.026
to have that cities data

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:16.395
in our system by the end of the

02:12:16.461 --> 02:12:18.964
year and using that as our test

02:12:19.564 --> 02:12:21.233
structure for how we will

02:12:21.300 --> 02:12:23.835
then go to -- are

02:12:24.303 --> 02:12:26.571
-- clean utility provider

02:12:26.638 --> 02:12:29.241
peninsula clean energy --

02:12:29.841 --> 02:12:31.610
S. to see what their data

02:12:31.677 --> 02:12:32.944
said looks like so that we can

02:12:33.011 --> 02:12:34.246
incorporate their information

02:12:34.313 --> 02:12:36.181
as well so we're we're we're

02:12:36.248 --> 02:12:38.083
in using the same software were

02:12:38.150 --> 02:12:39.518
working on the same project

02:12:39.584 --> 02:12:41.453
-- we've we anticipated being

02:12:42.020 --> 02:12:44.623
successful in at least a test in

02:12:44.690 --> 02:12:46.992
very short short term thank

02:12:47.059 --> 02:12:48.560
you the other two counties

02:12:50.028 --> 02:12:51.830
yeah twenty county is excited

02:12:51.897 --> 02:12:53.465
about being able to utilize this

02:12:53.532 --> 02:12:55.267
tool -- the specifically with

02:12:55.334 --> 02:12:56.735
our utility sanitary district to

02:12:56.802 --> 02:12:58.704
be able to reach more folks --

02:12:58.770 --> 02:13:00.205
we do have a larger population

02:13:00.272 --> 02:13:02.174
of up retired in elderly --

02:13:02.240 --> 02:13:05.177
individuals and -- some of

02:13:05.243 --> 02:13:06.778
the intelligence individuals

02:13:06.845 --> 02:13:07.913
that we come in contact with

02:13:07.979 --> 02:13:09.181
our little more hesitant sign

02:13:09.247 --> 02:13:10.749
up for it but if they were to

02:13:10.816 --> 02:13:12.284
opt out and there are a part

02:13:12.351 --> 02:13:14.119
of it I I feel that it will

02:13:14.319 --> 02:13:15.287
make it a much more streamlined

02:13:15.354 --> 02:13:16.722
process for them to come into it

02:13:17.289 --> 02:13:18.857
-- and of course there will

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:20.158
be some work on the front end

02:13:20.225 --> 02:13:21.259
-- making sure we don't have

02:13:21.326 --> 02:13:23.829
duplications and and -- trying

02:13:23.895 --> 02:13:25.764
to transition it seamlessly

02:13:25.831 --> 02:13:27.933
into our current system --

02:13:27.999 --> 02:13:29.501
but there we definitely feel

02:13:29.568 --> 02:13:30.736
that there are a large amount

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:31.903
of benefits to this program

02:13:34.840 --> 02:13:35.640
I think my colleagues have

02:13:35.707 --> 02:13:36.908
covered it well a different

02:13:36.975 --> 02:13:38.477
software program in San Diego

02:13:38.543 --> 02:13:40.078
county but same issues with de

02:13:40.145 --> 02:13:41.446
conflicting as well as setting

02:13:41.513 --> 02:13:43.315
up a formal agreements with

02:13:43.382 --> 02:13:44.649
utilities which often take

02:13:44.716 --> 02:13:46.184
sometimes with lawyers lawyers

02:13:46.251 --> 02:13:47.886
involved -- I would just say

02:13:47.953 --> 02:13:50.122
that after -- in a year from now

02:13:50.188 --> 02:13:52.057
in twelve months when that tenth

02:13:52.124 --> 02:13:53.525
of a mile is established with

02:13:53.592 --> 02:13:55.227
wireless emergency alerts that

02:13:55.293 --> 02:13:56.395
will be our primary learning

02:13:56.461 --> 02:13:57.829
system because it does capture

02:13:57.896 --> 02:14:00.332
visitors -- and you know people

02:14:00.399 --> 02:14:02.834
who don't have a land line

02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:05.137
phones and our alert San Diego

02:14:05.203 --> 02:14:06.838
system we will still use it but

02:14:06.905 --> 02:14:08.573
it will be sort of our secondary

02:14:08.874 --> 02:14:10.509
-- system because we know will

02:14:10.575 --> 02:14:13.011
reach more people -- through

02:14:13.078 --> 02:14:14.746
the wireless emergency alerts

02:14:14.813 --> 02:14:16.448
then then with the other system

02:14:16.882 --> 02:14:18.850
but we we are excited about

02:14:18.917 --> 02:14:20.886
the the development with having

02:14:20.952 --> 02:14:22.354
utility information so the

02:14:22.421 --> 02:14:23.855
last question with respect to

02:14:23.922 --> 02:14:25.157
that it does this this does

02:14:25.223 --> 02:14:26.625
require cooperation from the

02:14:26.691 --> 02:14:28.126
utility companies they have the

02:14:28.193 --> 02:14:29.661
information at least most of it

02:14:29.995 --> 02:14:31.496
are in your experience are they

02:14:31.563 --> 02:14:33.565
cooperating is their problem

02:14:33.632 --> 02:14:35.200
is or something that needs

02:14:35.267 --> 02:14:37.436
to be done to get greater --

02:14:37.502 --> 02:14:39.504
participation by the companies

02:14:39.571 --> 02:14:41.173
in providing that information

02:14:42.307 --> 02:14:44.209
so far -- the utilities and

02:14:44.276 --> 02:14:45.510
I've approached have been very

02:14:45.577 --> 02:14:46.845
willing to cooperate with this

02:14:47.245 --> 02:14:48.814
-- I I think there sense of

02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:50.449
urgency is a little less than

02:14:50.515 --> 02:14:52.384
mine -- but on the numbers to

02:14:52.451 --> 02:14:53.785
manager some always anxious

02:14:54.186 --> 02:14:56.221
but -- I I think we're moving

02:14:56.288 --> 02:14:57.756
in the right direction and

02:14:57.823 --> 02:14:59.024
having the legislation to

02:14:59.090 --> 02:15:00.459
back up our request for

02:15:00.525 --> 02:15:02.093
information is being critical

02:15:04.863 --> 02:15:05.730
twenty counties worked with

02:15:05.797 --> 02:15:07.466
a lot of these districts and

02:15:07.532 --> 02:15:09.067
and incorporating them into

02:15:09.134 --> 02:15:10.535
our hazard mitigation plan

02:15:10.602 --> 02:15:11.503
and and we have a lot of

02:15:12.304 --> 02:15:13.371
good relationships with these

02:15:13.438 --> 02:15:14.539
folks in a lot of the same

02:15:14.606 --> 02:15:16.074
goals envisioned so I don't

02:15:16.141 --> 02:15:17.409
foresee any issues with with

02:15:17.476 --> 02:15:19.244
any of our local agencies and

02:15:19.311 --> 02:15:21.580
partners thank you

02:15:22.848 --> 02:15:24.382
thank you senator stern

02:15:26.852 --> 02:15:28.153
thank you similar --

02:15:30.522 --> 02:15:32.057
couple just quick factual

02:15:32.123 --> 02:15:34.526
question so how how has anyone

02:15:34.593 --> 02:15:36.561
used we a in the past year

02:15:36.628 --> 02:15:38.163
I know there is a there is a

02:15:38.230 --> 02:15:39.698
instance you mentioned Holly but

02:15:39.764 --> 02:15:42.067
just just by number of

02:15:42.133 --> 02:15:44.736
times twenty counties

02:15:44.803 --> 02:15:46.371
used at -- once for the Donald

02:15:46.438 --> 02:15:48.206
fire once for done now and then

02:15:48.273 --> 02:15:50.408
if you use your reverse nine

02:15:50.475 --> 02:15:52.244
one opt in framework how many

02:15:52.310 --> 02:15:55.146
times -- last two years say a

02:15:55.413 --> 02:15:57.516
got a dozen times about a dozen

02:15:58.116 --> 02:16:01.152
non fire exam a notification

02:16:01.419 --> 02:16:03.288
rivers come through fires this

02:16:03.355 --> 02:16:05.190
several different incidents in

02:16:05.257 --> 02:16:06.358
Santa Barbara county we pride

02:16:06.424 --> 02:16:07.459
use that a total of thirty

02:16:07.526 --> 02:16:09.027
times in the last twelve months

02:16:09.094 --> 02:16:11.263
ouija ouija okay in the last

02:16:11.329 --> 02:16:12.531
twelve months it's probably

02:16:12.597 --> 02:16:14.699
been between ten or fifteen

02:16:14.766 --> 02:16:16.401
the the majority of that was

02:16:16.468 --> 02:16:17.802
around the Thomas fire is the

02:16:17.869 --> 02:16:19.771
Thomas fire moved from Ventura

02:16:19.838 --> 02:16:20.906
county into Santa Barbara

02:16:20.972 --> 02:16:22.941
county incrementally we were

02:16:23.008 --> 02:16:25.443
sending out we alerts to alert

02:16:25.510 --> 02:16:26.845
folks about the evacuations

02:16:26.912 --> 02:16:27.946
that were Kern and we had to

02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:29.247
do that repeatedly over the

02:16:29.314 --> 02:16:30.382
course of several days and

02:16:30.448 --> 02:16:32.050
then subsequently for that the

02:16:32.117 --> 02:16:33.919
debris flows we actually also

02:16:33.985 --> 02:16:36.187
did a preemptive we -- as part

02:16:36.254 --> 02:16:38.657
of the evacuation process ahead

02:16:38.723 --> 02:16:40.759
of the January ninth the free

02:16:40.825 --> 02:16:42.661
flow I think I remember you

02:16:42.727 --> 02:16:43.929
have the alert early seeing

02:16:43.995 --> 02:16:45.297
one of them I just was going

02:16:45.363 --> 02:16:46.197
back through with my staff

02:16:46.264 --> 02:16:48.066
but fast moving brush fire

02:16:48.400 --> 02:16:50.769
was the big county wide alert

02:16:50.835 --> 02:16:53.004
that went and then it was in

02:16:53.071 --> 02:16:54.439
a refer and then went to refer

02:16:54.506 --> 02:16:56.041
to the county website it wasn't

02:16:56.107 --> 02:16:57.309
sinister there for refined

02:16:57.375 --> 02:16:58.910
said evacuation instructions

02:16:59.177 --> 02:17:01.046
it was sort of a general be

02:17:01.112 --> 02:17:03.582
ready then came more refined

02:17:03.648 --> 02:17:05.083
and and you sort of plug and

02:17:05.150 --> 02:17:06.585
play through the disaster

02:17:06.651 --> 02:17:08.153
where you're going we at first

02:17:08.219 --> 02:17:10.422
but then you're using other

02:17:10.722 --> 02:17:12.857
the other platform or or you

02:17:12.924 --> 02:17:14.459
should once you pick going

02:17:14.526 --> 02:17:15.994
that route you sort of stayed

02:17:16.061 --> 02:17:18.797
there it's it's a combination

02:17:18.863 --> 02:17:20.198
thinks of first I'm not sure

02:17:20.265 --> 02:17:21.666
if that was our alert embedded

02:17:21.733 --> 02:17:22.667
in Ventura county and either

02:17:22.734 --> 02:17:24.869
way I'm sorry but yeah it

02:17:24.936 --> 02:17:26.671
is same same idea what we try

02:17:26.738 --> 02:17:28.106
to do is we at a minimum we try

02:17:28.173 --> 02:17:29.374
to get three bits of information

02:17:29.441 --> 02:17:30.775
in there what's happening where

02:17:30.842 --> 02:17:32.010
it's happening and what people

02:17:32.077 --> 02:17:33.712
need to do to stay safe if we

02:17:33.778 --> 02:17:35.614
can will try to squeeze in some

02:17:35.680 --> 02:17:37.048
Sir link to more information

02:17:37.115 --> 02:17:39.818
right and -- that's extremely

02:17:39.884 --> 02:17:40.919
challenging with ninety

02:17:40.986 --> 02:17:42.420
characters at the start of the

02:17:42.487 --> 02:17:43.888
Thomas fire every we are that

02:17:43.955 --> 02:17:45.390
we sent out Santa Barbara county

02:17:45.457 --> 02:17:47.359
what county Y. and R. counties

02:17:47.425 --> 02:17:49.527
very diverse so we're in for

02:17:49.594 --> 02:17:50.862
having something occurring in

02:17:50.929 --> 02:17:52.397
say Santa Barbara longer south

02:17:52.464 --> 02:17:54.366
coast people in Santa Maria

02:17:55.233 --> 02:17:56.768
you know tens of miles away are

02:17:56.835 --> 02:17:58.203
getting that alerts so for not

02:17:58.269 --> 02:18:00.939
specific about the location --

02:18:01.006 --> 02:18:02.040
then there's going to be issues

02:18:02.107 --> 02:18:03.441
people are gonna be panicked

02:18:03.508 --> 02:18:05.010
unnecessarily in an unaffected

02:18:05.076 --> 02:18:06.311
area and like I mentioned before

02:18:06.378 --> 02:18:07.445
they're going to call nine one

02:18:07.512 --> 02:18:08.647
for more information to find

02:18:08.713 --> 02:18:10.248
out what to do we've had that

02:18:10.315 --> 02:18:12.417
happen and till next year right

02:18:12.484 --> 02:18:14.252
and next year we we the the

02:18:14.319 --> 02:18:15.687
system will update the tenth of

02:18:15.754 --> 02:18:17.656
a mile that should solve that

02:18:17.722 --> 02:18:19.157
should help you know actually in

02:18:19.224 --> 02:18:21.426
in the process of the I can't

02:18:21.493 --> 02:18:22.327
remember if it was during the

02:18:22.394 --> 02:18:24.095
Thomas fire or the debris flow

02:18:25.363 --> 02:18:27.198
the process actually became a

02:18:27.265 --> 02:18:29.668
fine without our knowledge we'd

02:18:29.734 --> 02:18:31.002
became aware that because we

02:18:31.069 --> 02:18:32.170
didn't receive the we are in

02:18:32.237 --> 02:18:34.339
the EOC that we sent out and

02:18:34.406 --> 02:18:35.607
we try to figure out why so we

02:18:35.674 --> 02:18:36.875
actually did some some field

02:18:36.941 --> 02:18:38.176
testing to try to figure out

02:18:38.243 --> 02:18:40.178
what area did receive the alerts

02:18:40.378 --> 02:18:42.747
since then -- it's it's been

02:18:42.814 --> 02:18:45.517
targeted -- to a greater

02:18:45.583 --> 02:18:46.618
degree than had been in the

02:18:46.685 --> 02:18:48.053
past so -- alerts are going out

02:18:48.119 --> 02:18:49.421
count or are we alerts I should

02:18:49.487 --> 02:18:50.522
say are going out county wide

02:18:50.588 --> 02:18:51.523
anymore they're going out to a

02:18:51.589 --> 02:18:53.358
much smaller more targeted area

02:18:53.892 --> 02:18:55.627
but at like was mentioned by

02:18:55.694 --> 02:18:57.095
one of the other speakers it's

02:18:57.395 --> 02:18:59.264
those we are at -- geo fences

02:18:59.330 --> 02:19:00.265
are really dependent on the

02:19:00.331 --> 02:19:02.734
configuration location a range

02:19:02.801 --> 02:19:04.202
right of the individual cell

02:19:04.269 --> 02:19:05.804
towers and even if you have

02:19:05.870 --> 02:19:07.639
those maps those ranges are are

02:19:08.473 --> 02:19:10.308
you know very you know across

02:19:10.375 --> 02:19:11.943
the board -- so that's been

02:19:12.010 --> 02:19:13.244
extremely challenging for us

02:19:13.311 --> 02:19:14.612
because we know that anytime

02:19:14.679 --> 02:19:16.081
we send this it's not going

02:19:16.147 --> 02:19:17.248
to go out necessarily to the

02:19:17.315 --> 02:19:18.783
poly gone that I draw on a map

02:19:18.850 --> 02:19:20.151
or dispatcher draws on a map

02:19:20.218 --> 02:19:22.520
to look it's gonna bleed

02:19:22.587 --> 02:19:24.956
over and there's also equal

02:19:25.023 --> 02:19:27.125
potential a if we go to small

02:19:27.192 --> 02:19:28.626
to not reach those towers for

02:19:28.693 --> 02:19:31.062
we and nothing goes out and so

02:19:31.129 --> 02:19:33.665
so it's it in a lot of ways

02:19:33.732 --> 02:19:36.034
it's -- one of our most

02:19:36.101 --> 02:19:37.368
valuable tools may be our most

02:19:37.435 --> 02:19:39.604
valuable tool but it also has

02:19:40.105 --> 02:19:41.840
a lot of complications that

02:19:42.040 --> 02:19:43.475
you don't make it difficult

02:19:43.541 --> 02:19:44.509
for us to get these out and

02:19:44.576 --> 02:19:45.810
what we're trying to do is

02:19:45.877 --> 02:19:48.747
hopefully once -- the character

02:19:48.813 --> 02:19:50.181
limit is increase it'll allow

02:19:50.248 --> 02:19:51.616
us to be more specific in the

02:19:51.683 --> 02:19:52.884
air so that even if something

02:19:52.951 --> 02:19:54.986
does go county wide if you are

02:19:55.053 --> 02:19:56.688
an orchid aye and something's

02:19:56.755 --> 02:19:57.989
occurrence out of our and says

02:19:58.056 --> 02:20:00.258
Santa Barbara -- you know you

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:01.292
might have gotten woken up in

02:20:01.359 --> 02:20:03.161
an all night hopefully not but

02:20:03.228 --> 02:20:04.229
you'll quickly be able look

02:20:04.295 --> 02:20:05.463
your phone say okay that's Santa

02:20:05.530 --> 02:20:06.798
Barbara on nine merry that's

02:20:06.865 --> 02:20:08.333
gonna be impacted by that what

02:20:08.399 --> 02:20:09.667
I'm hearing from you all is even

02:20:09.734 --> 02:20:11.636
if we get more refined with we

02:20:11.703 --> 02:20:13.705
-- either with character can't

02:20:13.772 --> 02:20:14.939
you can do a big county wide

02:20:15.006 --> 02:20:16.541
steerer find you also get to

02:20:16.608 --> 02:20:18.576
tenth of a mile you do

02:20:18.643 --> 02:20:19.778
everything you can on the Oct

02:20:19.844 --> 02:20:22.380
inside tacos it cetera to try

02:20:22.447 --> 02:20:23.748
to get the public information

02:20:23.815 --> 02:20:25.083
that we haven't had the opt in

02:20:25.150 --> 02:20:27.418
rates we need I mean I don't

02:20:27.485 --> 02:20:29.854
I don't represent days I know

02:20:30.789 --> 02:20:33.158
-- I counterparts their center

02:20:33.224 --> 02:20:35.326
Nielsen or Dahle your Gallagher

02:20:35.393 --> 02:20:36.828
date there's some going to be

02:20:36.895 --> 02:20:38.096
some strong opinions coming

02:20:38.163 --> 02:20:39.998
out of that incident -- and

02:20:40.064 --> 02:20:41.065
it always happens and law

02:20:41.132 --> 02:20:42.066
enforcement actually it's been

02:20:42.133 --> 02:20:43.635
a very difficult position to

02:20:43.701 --> 02:20:44.769
to make that discretionary

02:20:44.836 --> 02:20:45.937
call the state at the time

02:20:46.004 --> 02:20:47.705
work shares going to you know

02:20:47.772 --> 02:20:49.107
make the decision or on the

02:20:49.174 --> 02:20:50.308
back order like you're going to

02:20:51.409 --> 02:20:53.077
the transportation factor is

02:20:53.144 --> 02:20:54.813
it is an element here that I

02:20:54.879 --> 02:20:56.047
I want to know more about it

02:20:56.114 --> 02:20:56.981
don't know if it's appropriate

02:20:57.048 --> 02:20:57.882
for this panel but sort of

02:20:57.949 --> 02:20:59.284
understanding the staggered

02:20:59.350 --> 02:21:01.319
ifak discretionary decision

02:21:02.487 --> 02:21:03.788
tough judgment calls getting

02:21:03.855 --> 02:21:05.056
made I don't know what we can

02:21:05.123 --> 02:21:06.391
do for best practices we can

02:21:06.457 --> 02:21:07.826
talk to -- yes about that too

02:21:07.892 --> 02:21:09.527
but the last question was just

02:21:10.094 --> 02:21:11.563
even if all this gets better

02:21:11.629 --> 02:21:14.165
get more refined infrastructure

02:21:14.232 --> 02:21:15.600
goes down we're still down

02:21:15.834 --> 02:21:17.101
right cell phones are down

02:21:17.168 --> 02:21:19.404
you're still down so we even

02:21:19.470 --> 02:21:21.506
we are not fail safe because

02:21:21.573 --> 02:21:22.941
we a single point of failure

02:21:23.308 --> 02:21:24.676
in our telecommunications

02:21:24.742 --> 02:21:25.877
and our electricity system

02:21:26.544 --> 02:21:29.247
so question is how

02:21:29.314 --> 02:21:32.283
to veteran a great your voice

02:21:32.350 --> 02:21:34.819
is is emergency managers into

02:21:35.153 --> 02:21:37.121
telecommunications planning and

02:21:37.188 --> 02:21:38.389
great management because we're

02:21:38.456 --> 02:21:40.825
rebuilding our our power lines

02:21:40.892 --> 02:21:42.727
right now as we speak Edison

02:21:42.794 --> 02:21:44.896
is jumped on it added Wolsey

02:21:44.963 --> 02:21:46.231
mean things are going back up

02:21:46.531 --> 02:21:47.999
but we still have some of the

02:21:48.066 --> 02:21:49.300
same vulnerabilities some of

02:21:49.367 --> 02:21:50.468
the polls are better so they're

02:21:50.535 --> 02:21:52.003
going to be more fire resistant

02:21:52.070 --> 02:21:54.305
were still it we are greed

02:21:54.372 --> 02:21:55.640
still operates essentially the

02:21:55.707 --> 02:21:57.275
same way as it has been have

02:21:57.342 --> 02:21:58.543
you have you given thought

02:21:58.610 --> 02:22:00.144
to sort of how to participate

02:22:00.211 --> 02:22:00.979
I know you have limited

02:22:01.045 --> 02:22:02.080
capacity and maybe we can

02:22:02.146 --> 02:22:04.883
help with this but --

02:22:04.949 --> 02:22:07.685
how to how to get our rebuild

02:22:07.752 --> 02:22:09.153
of our telecommunications

02:22:09.220 --> 02:22:11.556
and energy systems to be more

02:22:11.623 --> 02:22:13.191
resilient to ensure that you're

02:22:13.258 --> 02:22:14.626
going to have a better shot

02:22:14.692 --> 02:22:15.860
as it is that more distribute

02:22:15.927 --> 02:22:17.495
generation for instance and are

02:22:17.562 --> 02:22:19.063
there sort of our do we need

02:22:19.130 --> 02:22:21.065
smaller cellular penetration

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:22.033
in the communities that aren't

02:22:22.100 --> 02:22:24.202
great depend -- I mean have

02:22:24.269 --> 02:22:26.437
you thought about sort of those

02:22:26.504 --> 02:22:27.505
technological improvements

02:22:27.572 --> 02:22:29.741
that you want to see and if so

02:22:29.807 --> 02:22:31.242
bring him to us I mean we're

02:22:31.309 --> 02:22:33.478
having -- a fire technology

02:22:33.544 --> 02:22:35.480
the PC just announced in March

02:22:35.546 --> 02:22:37.749
I think a fire tech symposium

02:22:38.082 --> 02:22:39.684
I think it's not just about fire

02:22:39.751 --> 02:22:41.152
fighting technology it's about

02:22:41.219 --> 02:22:43.421
resiliency technology so what

02:22:44.055 --> 02:22:46.024
what it like what's what's your

02:22:46.090 --> 02:22:47.926
best thought so for having gone

02:22:47.992 --> 02:22:50.361
through this what is the

02:22:50.695 --> 02:22:51.829
what we need in this rebuild

02:22:51.896 --> 02:22:52.764
what what should we be doing

02:22:52.830 --> 02:22:54.799
differently this time around if

02:22:54.866 --> 02:22:56.334
if you could wave a magic wand

02:22:58.169 --> 02:22:59.737
could I just suggest a brief

02:22:59.804 --> 02:23:00.638
answers because that's what

02:23:00.705 --> 02:23:01.973
the next panel was actually

02:23:02.040 --> 02:23:04.242
own clout if that's alright

02:23:04.309 --> 02:23:05.143
yeah we like unless you

02:23:05.209 --> 02:23:06.711
would have to sure unless

02:23:06.778 --> 02:23:08.012
you have some quick thoughts

02:23:08.079 --> 02:23:10.281
but that is of very good good

02:23:10.348 --> 02:23:11.716
question and the next panel

02:23:11.783 --> 02:23:12.917
is hopefully going to address

02:23:15.720 --> 02:23:16.754
thank you so much for taking

02:23:16.821 --> 02:23:18.122
the time add to it to have a

02:23:18.189 --> 02:23:19.424
conversation with us anything

02:23:19.490 --> 02:23:21.259
assembly member Levine is going

02:23:21.326 --> 02:23:23.027
to introduce the next panel

02:23:25.029 --> 02:23:26.130
thank you thanks very much

02:23:26.197 --> 02:23:27.598
for that and we're going to

02:23:27.665 --> 02:23:30.301
break the next panel out into

02:23:30.768 --> 02:23:32.637
two panels just simply because

02:23:33.104 --> 02:23:33.771
I don't think we have enough

02:23:33.838 --> 02:23:35.373
seats for -- for the seven

02:23:35.440 --> 02:23:36.841
people that we've got so let me

02:23:36.908 --> 02:23:38.543
invite up for next ups improving

02:23:38.609 --> 02:23:40.545
emergency alerting in California

02:23:40.745 --> 02:23:43.314
part one rob Lewin the director

02:23:43.381 --> 02:23:44.282
the Santa Barbara county

02:23:44.349 --> 02:23:46.050
office of emergency management

02:23:46.117 --> 02:23:47.552
Kevin a gallon the manager of

02:23:47.618 --> 02:23:49.387
the Ventura county sheriff's

02:23:49.454 --> 02:23:51.422
office of emergency services

02:23:51.689 --> 02:23:53.491
lieutenant Eric Everhart of the

02:23:53.558 --> 02:23:55.193
tawny county sheriff's office

02:23:55.259 --> 02:23:57.328
and captain Cindy Pontus the

02:23:57.395 --> 02:23:59.163
Santa Barbara area commander

02:23:59.464 --> 02:24:01.366
for the California highway

02:24:01.432 --> 02:24:03.868
patrol thank you for joining

02:24:03.935 --> 02:24:06.070
us and -- in Mister loan if you

02:24:06.137 --> 02:24:08.639
like to begin a senators

02:24:08.706 --> 02:24:10.541
and members thank you --

02:24:11.843 --> 02:24:13.644
overall the broader issue is

02:24:13.711 --> 02:24:16.247
evacuation ultimately in times

02:24:16.314 --> 02:24:17.815
of disaster be an approaching

02:24:17.882 --> 02:24:20.018
wildfire debris flow flutter

02:24:20.084 --> 02:24:21.486
hurricane evacuating people

02:24:21.552 --> 02:24:22.754
may be the only sure way to

02:24:22.820 --> 02:24:25.223
protect them evacuating people

02:24:25.289 --> 02:24:27.058
is complicated the decision to

02:24:27.125 --> 02:24:29.260
evacuate the timing the method

02:24:29.327 --> 02:24:31.062
the messaging the manner of

02:24:31.129 --> 02:24:32.296
alerting the coordinating of

02:24:32.363 --> 02:24:34.599
the evacuation all require

02:24:34.665 --> 02:24:35.800
a great deal planning

02:24:36.000 --> 02:24:38.269
educating staffing and funding

02:24:39.170 --> 02:24:41.472
ostensibly evacuation seem

02:24:41.539 --> 02:24:43.474
simple alert those who need to

02:24:43.541 --> 02:24:45.943
leave and they'll comply of

02:24:46.010 --> 02:24:47.979
course evacuation is complex

02:24:48.513 --> 02:24:50.181
emergency responders may not

02:24:50.248 --> 02:24:51.883
fully understand the situation

02:24:52.283 --> 02:24:53.918
technology and staff training

02:24:53.985 --> 02:24:55.553
women options especially when

02:24:55.620 --> 02:24:57.388
events outpace expectations

02:24:57.855 --> 02:24:59.157
finally in the chaos of a

02:24:59.223 --> 02:25:00.858
disaster citizens ultimately

02:25:00.925 --> 02:25:02.260
make their own decisions

02:25:02.527 --> 02:25:04.128
individually on their course

02:25:04.195 --> 02:25:06.464
of action in some incidents

02:25:06.531 --> 02:25:07.498
emergency officials have

02:25:07.565 --> 02:25:09.167
enough time to do three things

02:25:09.734 --> 02:25:12.203
create a plan alert the public

02:25:12.403 --> 02:25:14.005
and execute the evacuation

02:25:14.639 --> 02:25:16.174
other emergency situations

02:25:16.240 --> 02:25:17.775
cascade rapidly without

02:25:17.842 --> 02:25:19.710
adequate time for advance

02:25:19.777 --> 02:25:22.380
preparation or warning alerting

02:25:22.447 --> 02:25:24.182
becomes a kill the feel of

02:25:24.248 --> 02:25:25.683
evacuation when it comes to

02:25:25.750 --> 02:25:27.118
late or doesn't reach enough

02:25:27.185 --> 02:25:29.020
people to Brett loss of life

02:25:30.888 --> 02:25:32.190
instead of a common approach

02:25:32.256 --> 02:25:33.958
to learning evacuation however

02:25:34.225 --> 02:25:35.493
each of California's fifty

02:25:35.560 --> 02:25:37.028
eight counties have been left

02:25:37.095 --> 02:25:39.097
to its own devices resources

02:25:39.163 --> 02:25:41.232
and safeguard lives -- during

02:25:41.299 --> 02:25:43.201
disasters then after each

02:25:43.267 --> 02:25:45.436
tragedy news articles identify

02:25:45.503 --> 02:25:46.571
perceived failures of the

02:25:46.637 --> 02:25:47.972
impacted county systems and

02:25:48.039 --> 02:25:50.108
methods blame misplaced however

02:25:50.174 --> 02:25:51.442
and appropriately in the light

02:25:51.509 --> 02:25:53.411
of hindsight and finally some

02:25:53.478 --> 02:25:55.513
corrections are made the next

02:25:55.580 --> 02:25:57.048
time disaster strikes me joining

02:25:57.115 --> 02:25:58.449
county or in a county that just

02:25:58.516 --> 02:25:59.750
does not have the resources

02:25:59.817 --> 02:26:01.719
to identify and fix a problem

02:26:01.953 --> 02:26:03.421
they do not know they even have

02:26:03.688 --> 02:26:04.989
the same systematic problem

02:26:05.056 --> 02:26:06.290
leads to greater loss of life

02:26:06.357 --> 02:26:07.725
and property the necessary

02:26:08.593 --> 02:26:09.927
following the two thousand three

02:26:09.994 --> 02:26:11.195
devastating fires in southern

02:26:11.262 --> 02:26:12.930
California that killed twenty

02:26:12.997 --> 02:26:14.365
four destroyed three thousand

02:26:14.432 --> 02:26:16.400
seven hundred ten homes outgoing

02:26:20.872 --> 02:26:22.206
Ribbon fire commission charged

02:26:22.273 --> 02:26:24.275
with broad review of all aspects

02:26:24.342 --> 02:26:25.576
of wildland fire impacts in

02:26:25.643 --> 02:26:27.745
California the governor's Blue

02:26:27.812 --> 02:26:30.248
Ribbon fire commission a report

02:26:30.314 --> 02:26:31.849
-- was very comprehensive and

02:26:31.916 --> 02:26:33.518
identified many recommendations

02:26:33.584 --> 02:26:34.886
that dealt with all aspects of

02:26:34.952 --> 02:26:37.121
while and fire protection one of

02:26:37.188 --> 02:26:39.390
those clearly identified -- they

02:26:39.457 --> 02:26:41.225
need to improve systems to alert

02:26:41.292 --> 02:26:43.394
and evacuate residents a quote

02:26:43.461 --> 02:26:45.062
from the report the commission

02:26:45.129 --> 02:26:46.931
recognizes the critical role of

02:26:46.998 --> 02:26:48.466
timely emergency notification

02:26:48.533 --> 02:26:49.901
of the public of imminent

02:26:49.967 --> 02:26:51.068
threats and recommends that

02:26:51.135 --> 02:26:52.637
local governments prioritize

02:26:52.703 --> 02:26:54.272
development of appropriately

02:26:54.338 --> 02:26:55.907
early warning systems to address

02:26:55.973 --> 02:26:57.275
the needs of their communities

02:26:57.775 --> 02:26:58.809
many of the victims of the

02:26:58.876 --> 02:27:00.444
October two thousand three fire

02:27:00.511 --> 02:27:01.746
siege indicated that they had

02:27:01.812 --> 02:27:03.514
no warning of the fires approach

02:27:03.948 --> 02:27:05.316
in examining potential early

02:27:05.383 --> 02:27:06.617
warning system to address our

02:27:06.684 --> 02:27:08.286
needs of their communities local

02:27:08.352 --> 02:27:09.487
governments should consider

02:27:09.554 --> 02:27:10.955
reverse nine one one emergency

02:27:11.022 --> 02:27:12.890
evacuation siren systems and

02:27:12.957 --> 02:27:14.358
potential combination systems

02:27:14.425 --> 02:27:15.927
especially in remote areas

02:27:17.094 --> 02:27:19.063
so what do we do to improve

02:27:19.130 --> 02:27:20.498
our learning and ultimately

02:27:20.565 --> 02:27:22.867
evacuation so taking a cue

02:27:22.934 --> 02:27:24.068
from the two thousand three

02:27:24.135 --> 02:27:25.670
fire season it behooves us to

02:27:25.736 --> 02:27:27.004
once again convene a diverse

02:27:27.071 --> 02:27:28.839
group of experts to focus

02:27:28.906 --> 02:27:30.641
on evacuation alerting and

02:27:30.708 --> 02:27:32.243
provide a foundation for all

02:27:32.310 --> 02:27:34.612
the counties -- to insure

02:27:34.679 --> 02:27:36.347
each county has three tangible

02:27:36.414 --> 02:27:38.049
things for successful learning

02:27:38.683 --> 02:27:40.885
software and hardware adequate

02:27:40.952 --> 02:27:43.120
staffing and good training

02:27:43.955 --> 02:27:45.256
number three for an alert to

02:27:45.323 --> 02:27:46.924
be successful requires five

02:27:46.991 --> 02:27:49.227
three five things the field

02:27:49.293 --> 02:27:51.562
into c£m Anders of fire law

02:27:51.862 --> 02:27:53.097
need to be able to attain

02:27:53.164 --> 02:27:54.398
a situational understanding

02:27:54.465 --> 02:27:56.734
the murders he quickly lan

02:27:57.201 --> 02:27:59.036
to put together they must

02:27:59.103 --> 02:28:00.338
convey the actions of the

02:28:00.404 --> 02:28:03.174
public needs -- they must convey

02:28:03.241 --> 02:28:04.308
the action the public needs

02:28:04.375 --> 02:28:06.210
to take to -- the dispatch

02:28:06.277 --> 02:28:08.579
center a clear messaging of

02:28:08.646 --> 02:28:10.281
the public that they understand

02:28:10.348 --> 02:28:11.582
including a multiple language

02:28:11.649 --> 02:28:13.017
must be sent quickly from that

02:28:13.084 --> 02:28:15.186
dispatch center a technical

02:28:15.253 --> 02:28:16.587
system that works faster

02:28:16.654 --> 02:28:18.422
deliver the alert message every

02:28:18.489 --> 02:28:21.125
time -- we have so providers

02:28:21.192 --> 02:28:22.627
that are now as important

02:28:22.693 --> 02:28:24.395
as our public utilities they

02:28:24.462 --> 02:28:25.563
should be included in that

02:28:25.630 --> 02:28:27.798
level of regulation and

02:28:27.865 --> 02:28:29.500
finally a citizenry that is

02:28:29.567 --> 02:28:30.768
prepared and willing to take

02:28:30.835 --> 02:28:32.970
action such as to evacuate

02:28:33.571 --> 02:28:35.239
thinking thank you Mister

02:28:35.306 --> 02:28:37.808
Lewis wrote down cheers

02:28:37.875 --> 02:28:40.244
on shares honorable

02:28:40.311 --> 02:28:41.579
members of the committee my

name's coming down from the

02:28:42.847 --> 02:28:43.948
Ventura county sheriff's office

for this opportunity to provide

02:28:47.385 --> 02:28:48.619
testimony today regarding

02:28:48.686 --> 02:28:51.122
emergency notifications --

02:28:51.188 --> 02:28:52.957
first I would like to just offer

02:28:53.024 --> 02:28:54.625
a heartfelt thanks on behalf

02:28:54.692 --> 02:28:56.193
Ventura county for everyone

02:28:56.260 --> 02:28:58.596
that -- supported us during our

02:28:58.663 --> 02:29:00.298
response and now are recovery

02:29:00.364 --> 02:29:02.099
from the borderline hill and

02:29:02.166 --> 02:29:03.601
we'll see incidents it's been

02:29:03.668 --> 02:29:05.736
a pretty impactful two weeks

02:29:06.170 --> 02:29:07.605
-- many of the people in this

02:29:07.672 --> 02:29:09.774
room and maybe watching where

02:29:09.840 --> 02:29:11.208
some of the first responders to

02:29:11.275 --> 02:29:13.577
mutually to help us out so thank

02:29:13.644 --> 02:29:15.479
you Ventura counties Hauser

02:29:15.546 --> 02:29:18.115
portfolio spans a pretty broad

02:29:18.182 --> 02:29:19.884
broad spectrum is many places in

02:29:19.950 --> 02:29:22.053
California we have technological

02:29:22.119 --> 02:29:24.355
failure hazards such as dams

02:29:24.588 --> 02:29:26.457
natural hazards earthquakes

02:29:26.524 --> 02:29:27.858
being one of the prominent

02:29:27.925 --> 02:29:29.493
ones and human costs threats

02:29:29.560 --> 02:29:31.462
such as terrorism unfortunately

02:29:31.529 --> 02:29:33.164
many of these hazards we face

02:29:33.664 --> 02:29:35.433
-- have the potential to yield

02:29:35.499 --> 02:29:37.134
catastrophic results and come

02:29:37.201 --> 02:29:38.669
with no notice so there's a

02:29:38.736 --> 02:29:40.638
big difference between what our

02:29:40.705 --> 02:29:43.374
east coast -- public safety

02:29:43.441 --> 02:29:44.909
organizations may face with a

02:29:44.975 --> 02:29:47.078
hurricane -- than what we face

02:29:47.144 --> 02:29:48.946
here in southern California or

02:29:49.013 --> 02:29:50.915
California on the broader scale

02:29:51.515 --> 02:29:54.118
-- this is why I

02:29:54.318 --> 02:29:55.653
I think I'm you know alert

02:29:55.720 --> 02:29:56.987
and warning has become such a

02:29:57.054 --> 02:29:59.390
valuable tool but also is one

02:29:59.457 --> 02:30:00.791
of the most important critical

02:30:00.858 --> 02:30:02.259
responsibilities and functions

02:30:02.326 --> 02:30:03.694
we face in public safety on

02:30:03.761 --> 02:30:04.895
these large scale events and

02:30:04.962 --> 02:30:07.098
disasters on because it out

02:30:07.164 --> 02:30:08.799
inventor county we strive for

02:30:08.866 --> 02:30:10.334
perfection in alert and warning

02:30:10.668 --> 02:30:11.836
we've invested significant

02:30:11.902 --> 02:30:13.070
capital and resources over

02:30:13.137 --> 02:30:14.205
the years to ensure that we

02:30:14.271 --> 02:30:15.573
have a successful program

02:30:16.006 --> 02:30:17.408
and at the core of the it's a

02:30:17.475 --> 02:30:19.744
partnership and a lot of our

02:30:19.810 --> 02:30:21.045
colleagues today have already

02:30:21.112 --> 02:30:23.481
discussed this but -- rob

02:30:23.748 --> 02:30:24.749
rob brought it up with the

02:30:24.815 --> 02:30:26.751
-- the comment about alert

02:30:26.817 --> 02:30:28.719
mornings really just a tool

02:30:28.953 --> 02:30:30.788
it's evacuations its emergency

02:30:30.855 --> 02:30:31.922
protective measures that were

02:30:31.989 --> 02:30:33.657
trying to communicate and those

02:30:33.724 --> 02:30:35.926
are originated via software

02:30:35.993 --> 02:30:38.329
tool -- those are human decision

02:30:38.396 --> 02:30:40.364
making processes and capacities

02:30:40.631 --> 02:30:42.366
and so first and foremost I just

02:30:42.433 --> 02:30:43.434
want to acknowledge that and

02:30:43.501 --> 02:30:45.770
Ventura county -- we look at

02:30:45.836 --> 02:30:48.105
that as the primary -- the

02:30:48.172 --> 02:30:50.007
primary focus of an effective

02:30:50.074 --> 02:30:51.776
alert morning program is this

02:30:51.842 --> 02:30:53.344
human element the decision

02:30:53.411 --> 02:30:55.279
making process -- and it's

02:30:55.346 --> 02:30:56.881
an integration between what's

02:30:56.947 --> 02:30:58.716
going on in the field and what's

02:30:58.783 --> 02:31:00.618
going on out support locations

02:31:00.684 --> 02:31:01.986
whether their command post

02:31:02.052 --> 02:31:04.188
emergency operation centers --

02:31:04.255 --> 02:31:06.724
so forth -- our approach

02:31:06.791 --> 02:31:08.459
to hold community emergency

02:31:08.526 --> 02:31:10.861
management on the grand scale is

02:31:10.928 --> 02:31:12.496
-- definitely echoed throughout

02:31:12.563 --> 02:31:13.898
our emergency notification an

02:31:13.964 --> 02:31:16.333
alert morning program of inter

02:31:16.400 --> 02:31:18.169
county all ten cities along

02:31:18.235 --> 02:31:19.937
with the county on a formal

02:31:20.004 --> 02:31:21.071
are in mourning agreement

02:31:21.138 --> 02:31:22.573
which establishes our baseline

02:31:22.640 --> 02:31:24.508
standards and processes this

02:31:24.575 --> 02:31:25.976
also includes our emergency

02:31:26.043 --> 02:31:27.978
operations plan that includes

02:31:28.045 --> 02:31:30.114
sections -- that discuss how

02:31:30.548 --> 02:31:31.782
alert morning is going to take

02:31:31.849 --> 02:31:33.751
place in the county -- we use

02:31:33.818 --> 02:31:36.086
a multi modal system -- that

02:31:36.153 --> 02:31:37.521
system includes our emergency

02:31:37.588 --> 02:31:39.056
alert system the wireless

02:31:39.123 --> 02:31:40.858
emergency alert system VC alert

02:31:40.925 --> 02:31:43.327
which is our locally -- managed

02:31:43.394 --> 02:31:46.330
program -- siren systems for

02:31:46.397 --> 02:31:48.098
one particular hazard the dam

02:31:48.165 --> 02:31:50.367
hazard -- and then all of

02:31:50.434 --> 02:31:51.802
our other sources traditional

02:31:51.869 --> 02:31:54.071
social media -- websites

02:31:54.305 --> 02:31:55.606
and then something I can't under

02:31:55.673 --> 02:31:57.341
emphasize but it's the in person

02:31:57.408 --> 02:31:59.109
notification we spent a lot of

02:31:59.176 --> 02:32:00.578
time talking today about the

02:32:00.644 --> 02:32:02.880
technological side but when you

02:32:02.947 --> 02:32:05.282
have it a no notice event such

02:32:05.349 --> 02:32:06.917
is the hill fire that occurred

02:32:07.384 --> 02:32:09.186
-- it doesn't matter if you

02:32:09.253 --> 02:32:10.488
have dispatchers who are twenty

02:32:10.554 --> 02:32:12.089
four seven it doesn't matter

02:32:12.156 --> 02:32:13.324
if you have someone keyed up

02:32:13.390 --> 02:32:14.792
ready to you -- type out an

02:32:14.859 --> 02:32:17.261
emergency notification initial

02:32:17.328 --> 02:32:18.596
notifications gonna happen

02:32:18.662 --> 02:32:20.431
by first responders inventor

02:32:20.498 --> 02:32:21.999
county we spent a lot of time

02:32:22.066 --> 02:32:24.301
training discussing planning for

02:32:24.735 --> 02:32:27.171
-- -- variations in what would

02:32:27.238 --> 02:32:28.572
be our typical response to

02:32:28.639 --> 02:32:31.742
something so if there's a fire

02:32:31.809 --> 02:32:33.577
it's rapidly moving based off

02:32:33.644 --> 02:32:35.579
of red flag conditions we as an

02:32:35.646 --> 02:32:37.281
operational area take different

02:32:37.348 --> 02:32:39.450
actions initially them what

02:32:39.517 --> 02:32:40.651
would have been take in if

02:32:40.718 --> 02:32:42.286
it wasn't in those conditions

02:32:42.520 --> 02:32:44.154
such as fire resources and law

02:32:44.221 --> 02:32:45.689
enforcement resources might not

02:32:45.756 --> 02:32:47.258
actually put out the fire they

02:32:47.324 --> 02:32:48.859
might go down range to trying

02:32:48.926 --> 02:32:50.828
to evacuate people -- so in

02:32:50.895 --> 02:32:52.997
person notification still still

02:32:53.063 --> 02:32:55.432
is a very very important pillar

02:32:55.499 --> 02:32:57.434
within our notification process

02:32:57.868 --> 02:32:59.637
-- and knocking down includes

02:32:59.703 --> 02:33:00.738
all kinds of respond or is

02:33:00.804 --> 02:33:03.073
using PA systems aviation air

02:33:03.140 --> 02:33:05.175
assets -- the whole nine yards

02:33:05.910 --> 02:33:07.111
aye during recent incidents

02:33:07.177 --> 02:33:08.412
like the Thomas fire walls

02:33:08.479 --> 02:33:09.947
the in hell fires be deployed

02:33:10.014 --> 02:33:11.482
everyone of these tools to

02:33:11.549 --> 02:33:13.150
significant levels and we've

02:33:13.217 --> 02:33:14.552
had the opportunity to see were

02:33:14.618 --> 02:33:16.220
some of the challenges exist

02:33:16.287 --> 02:33:17.588
within the deployment of these

02:33:17.655 --> 02:33:19.456
tools I also would like to

02:33:19.990 --> 02:33:21.625
mention that pose the Thomas

02:33:21.692 --> 02:33:22.726
fire all of our lives have

02:33:22.793 --> 02:33:24.194
gone out in both English and

02:33:24.261 --> 02:33:25.863
Spanish along with all of our

02:33:25.930 --> 02:33:27.231
support public information

02:33:27.298 --> 02:33:29.033
tools such as our websites and

02:33:29.099 --> 02:33:31.101
social media accounts -- it

02:33:31.168 --> 02:33:34.405
comes out Acosta aye specificity

02:33:34.605 --> 02:33:37.341
and -- -- the ability

02:33:37.408 --> 02:33:39.777
to be -- clear and timely

02:33:39.843 --> 02:33:41.178
when you're adding translation

02:33:41.245 --> 02:33:43.847
factors into it definitely has

02:33:43.914 --> 02:33:46.183
-- degraded timeliness or

02:33:46.250 --> 02:33:48.652
effectiveness -- however it's

02:33:48.719 --> 02:33:49.987
increase the effectiveness in

02:33:50.054 --> 02:33:51.322
communicating to you larger

02:33:51.388 --> 02:33:53.090
populations so there's a

02:33:53.157 --> 02:33:54.625
given take and we're trying to

02:33:54.692 --> 02:33:56.226
navigate through that process

02:33:56.293 --> 02:33:58.662
as we work in -- unfortunately

02:33:58.729 --> 02:33:59.830
were navigating it through

02:33:59.897 --> 02:34:02.433
during real disasters --

02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:05.369
currently not one of these tools

02:34:05.436 --> 02:34:07.404
is perfect we for that multiple

02:34:07.471 --> 02:34:09.840
times today -- there's plenty

02:34:09.907 --> 02:34:11.909
of limitations each one use so

02:34:11.976 --> 02:34:13.510
that's why were in all in county

02:34:13.844 --> 02:34:15.412
we deploy every tool we think

02:34:15.479 --> 02:34:17.147
is appropriate given the scale

02:34:17.214 --> 02:34:19.283
or the severity of that event

02:34:19.683 --> 02:34:20.684
now we're not gonna send out a

02:34:20.751 --> 02:34:22.319
wireless emergency alert for a

02:34:22.386 --> 02:34:25.456
small -- -- incident

02:34:25.522 --> 02:34:26.991
that's in packing a very you

02:34:27.057 --> 02:34:28.459
know type population we might

02:34:28.525 --> 02:34:29.994
have better opportunities using

02:34:30.060 --> 02:34:31.195
in person notifications and

02:34:31.261 --> 02:34:32.696
our and our hosted system the

02:34:32.763 --> 02:34:34.698
sealer -- but when we rise to

02:34:34.765 --> 02:34:36.233
the scale of large fast moving

02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:37.635
brush fires or other types

02:34:37.701 --> 02:34:39.169
of events -- we had hazardous

02:34:39.236 --> 02:34:41.639
materials incidents -- a few

02:34:41.705 --> 02:34:43.507
years back in Santa Paula we

02:34:43.574 --> 02:34:45.476
use every tool on those types of

02:34:45.542 --> 02:34:47.778
events -- to mitigate these

02:34:47.845 --> 02:34:50.714
limitations enhance infected

02:34:50.948 --> 02:34:52.249
effectiveness in providing

02:34:52.316 --> 02:34:54.284
emergency notifications alerts

02:34:54.351 --> 02:34:55.719
and warnings for this panel

02:34:55.786 --> 02:34:57.721
to take kind of contemplate a

02:34:57.788 --> 02:34:58.822
few things that we think are

02:34:58.889 --> 02:35:01.725
important one obtaining better

02:35:01.959 --> 02:35:03.594
access to the best data sets

02:35:03.661 --> 02:35:05.996
available including -- cellular

02:35:06.063 --> 02:35:08.666
service providers -- continued

02:35:08.732 --> 02:35:10.134
funding for local emergency

02:35:10.200 --> 02:35:11.535
management training programs

02:35:11.602 --> 02:35:13.437
and continue funding to procure

02:35:13.504 --> 02:35:14.772
the best a learn warning systems

02:35:14.838 --> 02:35:17.107
available on the market --

02:35:17.508 --> 02:35:18.942
even with passing the recent

02:35:19.009 --> 02:35:21.378
legislation for example that the

02:35:21.445 --> 02:35:23.580
opt out program -- with --

02:35:23.647 --> 02:35:25.883
utilities -- it doesn't include

02:35:25.949 --> 02:35:27.518
that cell service provider group

02:35:27.918 --> 02:35:30.320
and they have a monumental

02:35:30.387 --> 02:35:31.755
amount of data that could

02:35:31.822 --> 02:35:33.891
be used by us to effectively

02:35:33.957 --> 02:35:35.325
communicate that right now

02:35:35.392 --> 02:35:37.995
we don't have access to --

02:35:39.129 --> 02:35:40.064
additionally improvements

02:35:40.130 --> 02:35:41.198
in the wireless emergency

02:35:41.265 --> 02:35:44.001
alert system we as a local

02:35:44.068 --> 02:35:45.969
organization -- are trying

02:35:46.036 --> 02:35:47.204
constantly to communicate

02:35:47.271 --> 02:35:48.405
the importance through FEMA

02:35:48.472 --> 02:35:51.075
and the F. T. C. too quickly

02:35:51.141 --> 02:35:53.077
improve or provide these updates

02:35:53.143 --> 02:35:54.144
to the wireless emergency

02:35:54.211 --> 02:35:56.046
alert system I would just ask

02:35:56.113 --> 02:35:57.514
that you know the state also

02:35:57.581 --> 02:36:00.217
participate in that advocacy to

02:36:00.284 --> 02:36:01.919
continue to improve the wireless

02:36:01.985 --> 02:36:03.487
emergency alert system or I

02:36:03.554 --> 02:36:04.855
pause the integrated public

02:36:04.922 --> 02:36:06.323
alert and warning system as

02:36:06.390 --> 02:36:08.425
the programs called -- at the

02:36:08.492 --> 02:36:10.027
national level and when we get

02:36:10.094 --> 02:36:12.262
this new rollout next year --

02:36:12.329 --> 02:36:13.897
with expanded characters and the

02:36:13.964 --> 02:36:15.899
possibility of embedded images

02:36:16.300 --> 02:36:18.035
we're we're a nation of images

02:36:18.102 --> 02:36:20.170
now -- we like to get evacuation

02:36:20.237 --> 02:36:22.272
orders with maps -- that's

02:36:22.339 --> 02:36:23.841
why all of us have interactive

02:36:23.907 --> 02:36:26.143
maps on our websites now I

02:36:26.343 --> 02:36:27.611
having the wireless emergency

02:36:27.678 --> 02:36:29.446
alert come across with expanded

02:36:29.513 --> 02:36:31.048
character count and then also

02:36:31.115 --> 02:36:32.816
embedded images would be an

02:36:32.883 --> 02:36:34.618
amazing -- improvement in that

02:36:34.685 --> 02:36:36.620
system but once we achieve that

02:36:36.687 --> 02:36:38.088
hurdle there's going to be the

02:36:38.155 --> 02:36:39.523
next hurdle that we need to

02:36:39.590 --> 02:36:42.059
achieve a jump over aye with

02:36:42.126 --> 02:36:43.460
wireless emergency alert and

02:36:43.527 --> 02:36:45.996
so just to continue to -- --

02:36:46.063 --> 02:36:47.598
advocacy on all of our parts

02:36:47.664 --> 02:36:48.699
at the local and state level

02:36:48.766 --> 02:36:49.867
with the federal government to

02:36:49.933 --> 02:36:51.635
continue to improve that project

02:36:51.869 --> 02:36:54.104
-- will be beneficial to us

02:36:54.171 --> 02:36:56.273
in the long run I including

02:36:56.340 --> 02:36:58.108
Ventura county will continue to

02:36:58.175 --> 02:36:59.843
-- collaborate with all of our

02:36:59.910 --> 02:37:01.211
partners both local state and

02:37:01.278 --> 02:37:03.113
federal to ensure that we're on

02:37:03.180 --> 02:37:05.182
the cutting edge of defective

02:37:05.549 --> 02:37:06.917
-- alert and warning but not the

02:37:06.984 --> 02:37:09.386
bleeding edge we tend not to

02:37:09.453 --> 02:37:11.355
want to deploy tools that are

02:37:11.421 --> 02:37:13.657
vetted in don't have -- tried

02:37:13.724 --> 02:37:15.559
and true methodology a we're

02:37:15.626 --> 02:37:16.760
one of those groups that was one

02:37:16.827 --> 02:37:18.462
of the early adopters of ouija

02:37:18.762 --> 02:37:20.397
however we didn't initially

02:37:20.464 --> 02:37:21.799
deploy our our wireless

02:37:21.865 --> 02:37:23.834
emergency alerts at first --

02:37:23.901 --> 02:37:25.969
because of the challenges and

02:37:26.036 --> 02:37:27.538
the unintended consequences

02:37:27.604 --> 02:37:29.439
that could have been a created

02:37:29.506 --> 02:37:31.008
by it so it took us some time

02:37:31.074 --> 02:37:33.710
to -- before we deployed in

02:37:33.777 --> 02:37:34.778
on the Thomas fire was the

02:37:34.845 --> 02:37:36.814
first time we deployed that I

02:37:36.880 --> 02:37:37.781
thank you very much for this

02:37:37.848 --> 02:37:39.082
opportunity to testify in and

02:37:39.149 --> 02:37:40.150
happy to answer any questions

02:37:40.217 --> 02:37:41.885
you may have your mistress from

02:37:41.952 --> 02:37:43.453
a gallon of the tenant -- heart

02:37:46.190 --> 02:37:47.457
put an error error with each

02:37:47.524 --> 02:37:48.892
woman county sheriff's office

02:37:49.226 --> 02:37:50.661
in is described earlier twelve

02:37:50.727 --> 02:37:52.196
county is a rural county were

02:37:52.262 --> 02:37:53.230
about twenty two hundred square

02:37:53.297 --> 02:37:54.798
miles with about fifty two

02:37:54.865 --> 02:37:56.166
thousand people so with the

02:37:56.233 --> 02:37:57.601
spread out quite a bit about

02:37:57.668 --> 02:37:58.936
seventy percent of that land

02:37:59.336 --> 02:38:00.604
is public land so we get a lot

02:38:00.671 --> 02:38:02.306
of outdoor recreation which

02:38:02.372 --> 02:38:03.540
was actually challenge during

02:38:03.607 --> 02:38:05.509
the Don L. fire going up those

02:38:05.576 --> 02:38:06.710
campgrounds because we don't

02:38:06.777 --> 02:38:08.345
have coverage in those areas

02:38:08.946 --> 02:38:09.913
a lot of the solutions we talk

02:38:09.980 --> 02:38:11.982
about deal with technology

02:38:12.049 --> 02:38:13.383
and we do used ever bridge

02:38:13.450 --> 02:38:15.185
we do use we -- but because

02:38:15.252 --> 02:38:16.486
of those gaps in the cell

02:38:16.553 --> 02:38:18.388
coverage in our county we

02:38:18.455 --> 02:38:20.057
still make personal contact

02:38:21.358 --> 02:38:23.126
with that said typical staffing

02:38:23.193 --> 02:38:24.795
for us for law enforcement is

02:38:24.862 --> 02:38:25.963
a sergeant three deputies for

02:38:26.029 --> 02:38:27.764
the entire county so for me that

02:38:28.665 --> 02:38:30.500
to get Debbie's out to a

02:38:30.567 --> 02:38:31.668
campground that maybe forty

02:38:31.735 --> 02:38:32.836
five minutes or an hour away to

02:38:32.903 --> 02:38:34.738
make sure it's clear -- working

02:38:34.805 --> 02:38:36.673
with local for service cal fire

02:38:36.740 --> 02:38:37.975
whoever else maybe in the area

02:38:38.408 --> 02:38:40.177
as a kid get those contacts out

02:38:40.244 --> 02:38:41.311
there when you start looking at

02:38:41.378 --> 02:38:43.981
ways to increased the resiliency

02:38:44.047 --> 02:38:46.049
or the coverage in those

02:38:46.116 --> 02:38:47.684
areas I know that first net

02:38:48.785 --> 02:38:50.120
is going to help without any

02:38:50.187 --> 02:38:51.221
with the following first not

02:38:51.288 --> 02:38:52.522
know the bill those solutions

02:38:52.589 --> 02:38:54.858
are many years out so as we

02:38:54.925 --> 02:38:56.793
go forward you I think we need

02:38:56.860 --> 02:38:58.762
to look at the so companies and

02:38:58.829 --> 02:39:00.197
see you asked the question are

02:39:00.264 --> 02:39:02.132
we doing everything we can to

02:39:02.199 --> 02:39:04.268
expedite that process second

02:39:04.334 --> 02:39:06.236
we are the so companies doing

02:39:06.303 --> 02:39:07.471
everything they can using all

02:39:07.537 --> 02:39:08.705
the technology that's available

02:39:08.772 --> 02:39:10.807
today to provide that resiliency

02:39:10.874 --> 02:39:12.342
so if that bundle of fiber is

02:39:12.409 --> 02:39:14.244
melted our cat -- that there's

02:39:14.311 --> 02:39:15.345
some type of back call whether

02:39:15.412 --> 02:39:17.147
it's be through radio or

02:39:17.214 --> 02:39:19.182
satellite to make sure that

02:39:19.249 --> 02:39:21.184
system stays up in place I we

02:39:21.251 --> 02:39:22.586
had a bundle of fiber several

02:39:22.653 --> 02:39:24.621
years ago coming into quality

02:39:24.688 --> 02:39:26.189
county that was cut and the

02:39:26.256 --> 02:39:27.591
majority county was without

02:39:27.658 --> 02:39:29.026
phone service for many hours

02:39:29.359 --> 02:39:30.527
-- because there was a single

02:39:30.594 --> 02:39:31.862
point of failure so we need

02:39:31.929 --> 02:39:33.196
to also make sure we identify

02:39:33.263 --> 02:39:34.865
where those other single point

02:39:34.932 --> 02:39:36.767
failures are -- so that's that's

02:39:36.833 --> 02:39:37.901
a big challenge for us in our in

02:39:37.968 --> 02:39:39.970
our county is one is having the

02:39:40.037 --> 02:39:41.371
system is reliable that we know

02:39:41.438 --> 02:39:42.506
is gonna get the message out

02:39:42.572 --> 02:39:43.707
but also getting the resources

02:39:43.774 --> 02:39:45.142
on the ground how to the people

02:39:45.208 --> 02:39:46.476
that need those notifications

02:39:49.446 --> 02:39:50.781
thank you lieutenant captain

02:39:50.847 --> 02:39:53.250

all law enforcement statewide

02:40:17.074 --> 02:40:18.141
into learning the public in

response to adopted children

02:40:20.310 --> 02:40:21.979
assaults on law enforcement

national emergency alert system

02:40:37.094 --> 02:40:38.495
to broadcast approved alerts

02:40:38.562 --> 02:40:41.064
across public television cable

02:40:41.131 --> 02:40:43.166
and radio broadcast networks

02:40:43.500 --> 02:40:45.469
we also utilize the wireless

02:40:45.535 --> 02:40:47.804
emergency alert system we add

02:40:48.505 --> 02:40:50.340
to you directly message cellular

specified geographic areas in

02:40:54.978 --> 02:40:56.513
addition to these alerts the

02:40:56.580 --> 02:40:57.981
C. H. P. may coordinate the

02:40:58.048 --> 02:40:59.750
activation of highway changeable

02:40:59.816 --> 02:41:02.085

the California state lottery

02:41:06.323 --> 02:41:07.624
and we also post to social

02:41:07.691 --> 02:41:10.127
media sites which are actively

02:41:10.193 --> 02:41:12.295
monitored by law enforcement

02:41:12.362 --> 02:41:13.764
and media outlets across the

lower emergency notifications

02:41:18.268 --> 02:41:19.703
to the public are typically

02:41:19.770 --> 02:41:21.805
disseminated within minutes

02:41:21.872 --> 02:41:24.207
of the initial request as

02:41:24.274 --> 02:41:25.942
a result of these capabilities

02:41:26.009 --> 02:41:27.511
proven over more than fifteen

02:41:27.577 --> 02:41:30.047
years this CHP possesses the

the relevant communications

02:41:33.750 --> 02:41:35.519

all law enforcement statewide

02:41:42.692 --> 02:41:44.161
unlike most other emergency

02:41:44.227 --> 02:41:46.163
operation centers which must be

02:41:46.229 --> 02:41:48.398
stood up over a period of time

02:41:48.465 --> 02:41:50.333
in response to an event the

02:41:50.400 --> 02:41:51.935

notification and tactical alert

02:41:54.004 --> 02:41:55.972
center around the clock twenty

02:41:56.039 --> 02:41:57.374
four seven three hundred and

02:41:57.441 --> 02:41:59.409
sixty five days a year which

02:41:59.476 --> 02:42:01.445
insures immediate access to a

02:42:01.511 --> 02:42:04.147
cadre of trained personnel only

02:42:04.214 --> 02:42:06.016
slowed in the dissemination

02:42:06.083 --> 02:42:07.684
of emergency notifications

02:42:08.018 --> 02:42:09.453
by the limitation of exist in

02:42:11.855 --> 02:42:13.490
not combined or limited by

jurisdiction a single county

02:42:15.225 --> 02:42:17.294
or city when disseminating

02:42:17.360 --> 02:42:18.895
emergency notifications

02:42:19.329 --> 02:42:21.731
rather as the state police the

02:42:21.798 --> 02:42:23.300
department rapidly pushes these

02:42:23.366 --> 02:42:26.169
notifications statewide or can

02:42:26.236 --> 02:42:27.971
target any combination of local

02:42:28.038 --> 02:42:30.140
jurisdiction I county or several

02:42:30.207 --> 02:42:32.609
counties several cities a suburb

02:42:32.676 --> 02:42:34.945
or specific neighborhood and

02:42:35.011 --> 02:42:36.413
that is necessary to reach

02:42:36.480 --> 02:42:38.381
the affected public based upon

02:42:38.448 --> 02:42:39.850
the specified incident that's

02:42:39.916 --> 02:42:41.751
occurring at the time the C.

02:42:41.818 --> 02:42:43.620
H. P.'s emergency notification

02:42:43.687 --> 02:42:45.622
and tactical alert center has

02:42:45.689 --> 02:42:47.858
become a known resource for all

02:42:47.924 --> 02:42:49.993
law enforcement statewide as a

02:42:50.060 --> 02:42:52.395
result of the amber blue and

02:42:52.462 --> 02:42:54.731
silver alert programs thinking

02:42:57.267 --> 02:42:58.602
thank you captain Pontes we're

02:42:58.668 --> 02:43:01.071
gonna ask for this panel to swap

02:43:01.138 --> 02:43:02.706
seats with part to the panel

02:43:02.772 --> 02:43:03.773
that to still hang out with

02:43:03.840 --> 02:43:05.142
us we may have some questions

02:43:05.208 --> 02:43:05.976
for you and you may have some

02:43:06.042 --> 02:43:07.911
more insight to add the like

02:43:07.978 --> 02:43:10.313
to welcome Dr Chad Hansen

02:43:10.380 --> 02:43:11.748
the research he colleges with

02:43:11.815 --> 02:43:14.050
the John Muir project Mitch

02:43:14.117 --> 02:43:15.552
make dig of itch the deputy

02:43:15.619 --> 02:43:17.120
director of logistics management

02:43:17.187 --> 02:43:18.221
from the governor's office of

02:43:18.288 --> 02:43:20.624
emergency services for an encore

02:43:20.690 --> 02:43:22.659
presentation and lily on and

02:43:22.726 --> 02:43:23.894
seen as the public outreach

02:43:23.960 --> 02:43:25.662
coordinator from the Santa

02:43:25.729 --> 02:43:27.931
Barbara fire department when

02:43:27.998 --> 02:43:29.499
I say thank you for all three

02:43:29.566 --> 02:43:31.268
of you for sticking it out and

02:43:31.334 --> 02:43:33.670
remain with us -- for this panel

02:43:35.005 --> 02:43:36.940
and doctor Hanson if you will

02:43:41.077 --> 02:43:43.246
thank you I want to thank the

02:43:43.313 --> 02:43:45.315
legislators said and staff

02:43:45.382 --> 02:43:46.917
first off for organizing this

02:43:46.983 --> 02:43:48.151
and and focusing on public

02:43:48.218 --> 02:43:50.187
safety -- on these issues

02:43:50.253 --> 02:43:51.354
-- I think that's year where

02:43:51.421 --> 02:43:53.290
where it needs to be --

02:43:54.391 --> 02:43:55.692
I also want to start by

02:43:56.826 --> 02:43:59.462
emphasizing -- that you're the

02:43:59.529 --> 02:44:00.830
point obviously is to create a

02:44:00.897 --> 02:44:01.998
public warning system that is

02:44:02.065 --> 02:44:03.500
effective and meaningful in in

02:44:03.567 --> 02:44:05.969
protecting the public and done

02:44:07.103 --> 02:44:08.772
there are two things that don't

02:44:08.838 --> 02:44:10.040
really need to happen to make

02:44:10.106 --> 02:44:11.875
sure that that occurs is not

02:44:11.942 --> 02:44:13.476
just a matter of of of having

02:44:13.543 --> 02:44:14.778
a warning system because out

02:44:15.145 --> 02:44:16.413
-- people have to receive it

02:44:16.479 --> 02:44:17.180
and we talked a little bit

02:44:17.247 --> 02:44:20.150
about that -- -- cellular

02:44:20.217 --> 02:44:21.585
-- is going to be obviously

02:44:21.651 --> 02:44:22.953
primary but some people don't

02:44:23.019 --> 02:44:25.288
have that access -- that the

02:44:25.355 --> 02:44:26.523
communication for structure can

02:44:26.590 --> 02:44:29.025
get taken up pretty easily so --

02:44:29.092 --> 02:44:30.427
low tech redundancies are going

02:44:30.493 --> 02:44:31.261
to be important they're going

02:44:31.328 --> 02:44:33.263
to continue to be important --

02:44:33.330 --> 02:44:35.398
sirens knocking on doors basic

02:44:35.465 --> 02:44:36.566
things like that especially

02:44:36.633 --> 02:44:37.767
some the more rural areas

02:44:38.368 --> 02:44:40.570
-- end of the second

02:44:40.637 --> 02:44:42.439
thing is that -- people

02:44:43.640 --> 02:44:45.942
you need to be able to receive

02:44:46.142 --> 02:44:47.611
the information a way that helps

02:44:47.677 --> 02:44:50.180
them to safely evacuate --

02:44:50.647 --> 02:44:53.550
and part of that comes down to

02:44:53.617 --> 02:44:54.818
-- for lease for some people

02:44:54.884 --> 02:44:56.920
evacuation assistance -- not

02:44:56.987 --> 02:44:58.688
everyone once they receive the

02:44:58.989 --> 02:45:00.557
warning is able to evacuate on

02:45:00.624 --> 02:45:02.425
their own -- there are some of

02:45:02.492 --> 02:45:03.927
residents who are elderly and

02:45:03.994 --> 02:45:05.895
are not able to -- actually

02:45:05.962 --> 02:45:07.430
-- leave quickly without

02:45:07.497 --> 02:45:08.898
assistance -- people gonna

02:45:08.965 --> 02:45:11.468
need that help -- some people

02:45:11.534 --> 02:45:13.003
need help evacuating themselves

02:45:13.069 --> 02:45:15.105
and animals as well and we need

02:45:15.171 --> 02:45:16.239
to keep that in mind because

02:45:16.306 --> 02:45:17.374
people are staying behind in

02:45:17.440 --> 02:45:18.308
some cases because they don't

02:45:18.375 --> 02:45:20.010
want to be there forces are dogs

02:45:20.076 --> 02:45:21.911
or cats need to be mindful of

02:45:21.978 --> 02:45:23.880
that -- so I think we need a

02:45:23.947 --> 02:45:26.216
a better evacuation assistance

02:45:26.283 --> 02:45:28.151
infrastructure -- they can be

02:45:28.218 --> 02:45:30.320
mobilized -- and that maybe

02:45:30.387 --> 02:45:31.688
is dispersed in various places

02:45:31.755 --> 02:45:32.989
especially during high fire

02:45:33.056 --> 02:45:33.823
weather when we know what's

02:45:33.890 --> 02:45:36.226
coming and then the

02:45:36.293 --> 02:45:38.061
the the other key aspect of this

02:45:38.128 --> 02:45:40.096
is the timing people need the

02:45:40.163 --> 02:45:42.065
amount of time to evacuate after

02:45:42.132 --> 02:45:44.134
they receive the warning and

02:45:44.200 --> 02:45:45.001
there's certain things that can

02:45:45.068 --> 02:45:47.570
influence that so I'm a talk

02:45:47.637 --> 02:45:49.773
about one of those briefly which

02:45:49.839 --> 02:45:52.575
is -- unplanned human additions

02:45:52.642 --> 02:45:53.410
in this comes in a lot of

02:45:53.476 --> 02:45:55.211
different forms but the reason

02:45:55.278 --> 02:45:57.480
I raise this especially as a

02:45:57.714 --> 02:45:59.215
a forest and fire ecologists

02:45:59.683 --> 02:46:01.418
is that ignitions are very very

02:46:01.484 --> 02:46:03.119
different in high elevation

02:46:03.386 --> 02:46:04.788
more remote mountain areas

02:46:04.988 --> 02:46:05.989
other farther away from

02:46:06.056 --> 02:46:07.123
communities those are mostly

02:46:07.190 --> 02:46:08.725
lightning strikes and those

02:46:08.792 --> 02:46:10.226
areas those fires are a long

02:46:10.293 --> 02:46:11.528
ways away the people have a

02:46:11.594 --> 02:46:12.996
lot of notice a lot of time

02:46:13.196 --> 02:46:14.364
even if those fires do move

02:46:14.431 --> 02:46:16.966
downslope towards towns Sir to

02:46:17.033 --> 02:46:18.702
communities in lower elevation

02:46:18.768 --> 02:46:20.870
areas those -- ignitions are

02:46:20.937 --> 02:46:22.639
overwhelmingly human additions

02:46:23.273 --> 02:46:24.607
and -- they're coming from a lot

02:46:24.674 --> 02:46:25.542
of different things sometimes

02:46:25.608 --> 02:46:27.177
it's power once images have

02:46:27.243 --> 02:46:28.378
a conversation about putting

02:46:28.445 --> 02:46:29.779
a lot of that underground in

02:46:29.846 --> 02:46:31.848
some cases making sure that

02:46:32.115 --> 02:46:33.183
those power ones are shut down

02:46:33.249 --> 02:46:34.284
during extreme fire weather

02:46:34.651 --> 02:46:36.252
-- and having the authority to

02:46:36.319 --> 02:46:38.188
do that in other cases it's is

02:46:38.254 --> 02:46:40.423
just people doing -- ill advised

02:46:40.490 --> 02:46:42.292
things fireworks are illegal

02:46:42.359 --> 02:46:44.994
campfires -- lots of things

02:46:45.061 --> 02:46:47.764
that can cause ignitions -- near

02:46:47.831 --> 02:46:49.432
communities in some cases it's

02:46:49.499 --> 02:46:51.234
ours are there is an example

02:46:51.301 --> 02:46:52.669
just a few weeks ago -- in

02:46:52.736 --> 02:46:53.603
the mountains where I live in

02:46:53.670 --> 02:46:55.405
southern California -- where

02:46:55.472 --> 02:46:57.507
we had -- the person driving up

02:46:57.574 --> 02:46:59.309
and down highway thirty eight

02:46:59.376 --> 02:47:01.711
in the truck throwing flaming

02:47:01.778 --> 02:47:04.280
objects out the window -- during

02:47:04.481 --> 02:47:05.749
what was predicted to be extreme

02:47:05.815 --> 02:47:08.051
fire weather -- and --

02:47:08.118 --> 02:47:09.719
this happened this one of ours

02:47:10.253 --> 02:47:11.988
and -- to my knowledge this

02:47:12.055 --> 02:47:13.623
individuals not was not caught

02:47:13.857 --> 02:47:15.191
but the point is is that people

02:47:15.258 --> 02:47:16.526
were you knew about this is

02:47:16.593 --> 02:47:18.261
happening this was going on for

02:47:18.328 --> 02:47:19.929
three or four hours up and down

02:47:19.996 --> 02:47:21.331
in this person was deliberately

02:47:21.398 --> 02:47:23.500
doing this to throw to try a

02:47:23.566 --> 02:47:25.235
treat fires near communities

02:47:25.535 --> 02:47:26.536
during what was predicted to

02:47:26.603 --> 02:47:27.771
be extreme fire weather now

02:47:28.004 --> 02:47:29.639
fortunately the heavy winds

02:47:29.706 --> 02:47:31.074
that were predicted didn't come

02:47:31.141 --> 02:47:32.909
on that particular day at that

02:47:32.976 --> 02:47:35.278
elevation and so -- disaster was

02:47:35.345 --> 02:47:36.780
averted but the point is is that

02:47:38.214 --> 02:47:39.582
extreme fire weather was known

02:47:39.649 --> 02:47:41.117
to be coming and this was a

02:47:41.184 --> 02:47:42.952
person who is taking advantage

02:47:43.019 --> 02:47:44.654
of that in a very -- your

02:47:44.721 --> 02:47:46.523
pathological way and -- this

02:47:46.589 --> 02:47:48.792
can be prevented if we have --

02:47:49.626 --> 02:47:51.094
more law enforcement funding

02:47:51.161 --> 02:47:52.328
more infrastructure devoted

02:47:52.395 --> 02:47:53.530
to preventing those on plan

02:47:53.596 --> 02:47:55.331
human additions in extreme

02:47:55.398 --> 02:47:57.233
fire weather near communities

02:47:57.467 --> 02:47:58.201
so I think we need to think

02:47:58.268 --> 02:47:59.636
about that because that

02:47:59.702 --> 02:48:01.171
matters from alert and warning

02:48:01.237 --> 02:48:03.006
standpoint because if it's

02:48:03.072 --> 02:48:04.407
humid missions are occurring

02:48:04.641 --> 02:48:05.675
close to communities during

02:48:05.742 --> 02:48:07.710
extreme fire weather then people

02:48:07.777 --> 02:48:08.812
have very very little time to

02:48:08.878 --> 02:48:10.079
evacuate once those warnings

02:48:10.146 --> 02:48:12.182
come and so it's it's a factor

02:48:12.248 --> 02:48:14.050
we need to keep in mind -- the

02:48:14.117 --> 02:48:16.486
other one -- mention yes just

02:48:16.553 --> 02:48:18.688
in terms of funding allocation

02:48:18.888 --> 02:48:20.990
-- where do we put our resources

02:48:21.057 --> 02:48:22.759
resources are finite and there's

02:48:22.826 --> 02:48:23.593
a lot of different funding

02:48:23.660 --> 02:48:25.128
streams out there that have

02:48:25.195 --> 02:48:26.162
been allocated for various

02:48:26.229 --> 02:48:28.364
things about these issues of

02:48:29.232 --> 02:48:31.401
the did the basic dichotomy is

02:48:31.468 --> 02:48:33.937
do we focus on -- vegetation

02:48:34.003 --> 02:48:35.071
management out and while this

02:48:35.138 --> 02:48:36.706
what we focus on communities

02:48:37.073 --> 02:48:38.708
-- defensible space -- home

02:48:38.775 --> 02:48:40.410
hardening -- making your Farsi

02:48:40.477 --> 02:48:42.312
principles prevention on twenty

02:48:42.378 --> 02:48:43.780
missions things a prevent those

02:48:43.847 --> 02:48:45.181
fires close in the communities

02:48:45.715 --> 02:48:47.283
and I would submit we we need to

02:48:47.350 --> 02:48:49.352
focus on the ladder -- and I set

02:48:49.419 --> 02:48:50.553
up for a couple reasons number

02:48:50.620 --> 02:48:51.621
one it's been proven to be

02:48:51.688 --> 02:48:53.490
highly effective -- and number

02:48:53.556 --> 02:48:54.791
two a lot of the vegetation

02:48:54.858 --> 02:48:55.792
management activities that

02:48:55.859 --> 02:48:57.861
happen removing chaparral for

02:48:57.927 --> 02:48:59.662
example can replace it with very

02:48:59.729 --> 02:49:01.097
combustible invasive grasses

02:49:01.164 --> 02:49:03.166
that spread far even faster --

02:49:03.233 --> 02:49:04.400
allowed the logging activities

02:49:04.467 --> 02:49:05.802
that occur can actually increase

02:49:05.869 --> 02:49:08.104
fire intensity and spread --

02:49:08.438 --> 02:49:10.206
and -- you again resources are

02:49:10.273 --> 02:49:12.909
finite so -- to the extent

02:49:12.976 --> 02:49:14.310
possible where there's

02:49:14.377 --> 02:49:16.813
flexibility -- I would argue

02:49:16.880 --> 02:49:18.381
that those resources should be

02:49:18.448 --> 02:49:19.949
focused and spent on protecting

02:49:20.016 --> 02:49:22.285
homes -- prevention on planes

02:49:22.352 --> 02:49:24.087
unit ditions helping people

02:49:24.153 --> 02:49:25.855
do defensible space doing all

02:49:25.922 --> 02:49:26.956
those things that can prevent

02:49:27.023 --> 02:49:28.591
fires and help people safely

02:49:28.658 --> 02:49:30.860
evacuate during fires -- I would

02:49:30.927 --> 02:49:33.062
say also that -- -- SB nine

02:49:33.129 --> 02:49:34.898
a one funding is an example

02:49:34.964 --> 02:49:36.733
of this three broad language

02:49:36.799 --> 02:49:38.034
fire prevention I think a lot

02:49:38.101 --> 02:49:39.235
of that funding to be used

02:49:39.536 --> 02:49:40.703
in that capacity and I would

02:49:41.104 --> 02:49:43.106
suggest that you be happy to

02:49:43.172 --> 02:49:45.141
questions with thank you doctor

02:49:45.208 --> 02:49:46.276
handsome semitic that should

02:49:47.977 --> 02:49:49.646
thank you are you know there's

02:49:49.712 --> 02:49:50.780
been a lot of great information

02:49:50.847 --> 02:49:51.748
it's been shared so I just

02:49:51.814 --> 02:49:52.916
wanted to target in a couple

02:49:52.982 --> 02:49:54.350
items -- specifically for

02:49:54.417 --> 02:49:56.119
improving -- and you've heard

02:49:56.185 --> 02:49:57.253
it over and over but it's

02:49:57.320 --> 02:49:58.321
-- it's not a question of

02:49:58.388 --> 02:49:59.689
if the question when you're

02:49:59.756 --> 02:50:00.857
gonna have to issue an alert

02:50:00.924 --> 02:50:04.027
so -- exercise in practice

02:50:04.093 --> 02:50:06.262
and proficiency -- has to

02:50:06.329 --> 02:50:08.898
be maintained at anybody who's

02:50:08.965 --> 02:50:10.500
going to be issuing alert has

02:50:10.567 --> 02:50:12.502
that authority and has that

02:50:12.569 --> 02:50:14.571
responsibility on has to be

02:50:14.637 --> 02:50:16.406
ready to to show when you get

02:50:16.472 --> 02:50:18.541
that warning -- whether it's

02:50:18.608 --> 02:50:20.910
a red flag or purple or

02:50:21.411 --> 02:50:23.146
-- National Weather -- warning

02:50:23.212 --> 02:50:25.081
of some type you know locally

02:50:25.148 --> 02:50:26.583
have to be ready to what's

02:50:26.649 --> 02:50:27.317
what is the message you're

02:50:27.383 --> 02:50:28.718
gonna send that alert level

02:50:29.586 --> 02:50:31.754
-- we talked là before but

02:50:31.821 --> 02:50:33.923
increase participation -- and

02:50:33.990 --> 02:50:35.358
there are multiple tools and

02:50:35.425 --> 02:50:36.759
tool kits and you have to have

02:50:36.826 --> 02:50:38.461
something in your could -- ready

02:50:38.528 --> 02:50:40.196
to be used at the local level

02:50:41.030 --> 02:50:43.466
-- all hit it again but --

02:50:43.533 --> 02:50:44.968
resiliency of infrastructure

02:50:45.034 --> 02:50:46.736
-- is is a recurring theme

02:50:46.803 --> 02:50:47.370
in you're going to hear

02:50:47.437 --> 02:50:49.038
that -- over and over again

02:50:50.974 --> 02:50:52.475
-- and so public safety grade

02:50:52.542 --> 02:50:54.110
should be our standard -- that

02:50:54.177 --> 02:50:56.546
we're looking at -- and in

02:50:56.813 --> 02:50:58.982
those areas -- with our full

02:50:59.048 --> 02:51:00.617
cooperation together between

02:51:00.683 --> 02:51:02.852
local to federal -- we should

02:51:02.919 --> 02:51:04.087
be able to take take a good

02:51:04.153 --> 02:51:05.688
chance to -- to tackle this

02:51:05.755 --> 02:51:06.923
set and come back to the

02:51:06.990 --> 02:51:08.558
original method thank you

02:51:10.493 --> 02:51:12.428
thank you very much Byzantinist

02:51:14.163 --> 02:51:15.298
hello thank you for having me

02:51:15.365 --> 02:51:16.499
I'm honored to be here and make

02:51:16.566 --> 02:51:18.601
a statement on these issues --

02:51:18.668 --> 02:51:20.269
secondary alerts for non English

02:51:20.336 --> 02:51:22.672
speakers is unacceptable just

02:51:22.739 --> 02:51:24.107
unacceptable cross cultural

02:51:24.173 --> 02:51:25.508
sensitivity successfully

02:51:25.575 --> 02:51:27.377
navigating a different culture

02:51:27.944 --> 02:51:29.879
and interacting with this

02:51:29.946 --> 02:51:32.015
culture cultural relativism

02:51:32.081 --> 02:51:33.449
is the idea that a person's

02:51:33.516 --> 02:51:36.252
beliefs values practices should

02:51:36.319 --> 02:51:38.121
be understood and based on

02:51:38.187 --> 02:51:40.323
that person's own culture it

02:51:40.390 --> 02:51:41.591
has been proven time and time

02:51:41.658 --> 02:51:43.993
again that -- in an emergency

02:51:44.060 --> 02:51:46.663
situation people will revert

02:51:46.729 --> 02:51:48.965
to their native language and

02:51:49.032 --> 02:51:51.200
I translators and interpreters

02:51:51.467 --> 02:51:54.003
build capacity and -- and

02:51:54.070 --> 02:51:55.071
they have to have deep

02:51:55.138 --> 02:51:57.306
knowledge of both languages

02:51:57.874 --> 02:52:00.576
-- -- these are skills or

02:52:00.643 --> 02:52:02.078
linguistic disciplines that

02:52:02.145 --> 02:52:03.413
are rarely performed by the

02:52:03.479 --> 02:52:05.214
same people the difference is

02:52:05.281 --> 02:52:06.983
not only the medium but the

02:52:07.050 --> 02:52:08.885
difference in skills training

02:52:08.951 --> 02:52:10.653
aptitude and even knowledge

02:52:10.887 --> 02:52:12.555
that are so substantial that few

02:52:12.622 --> 02:52:14.490
people can do it successfully

02:52:15.191 --> 02:52:16.492
we should not rely solely on

02:52:16.559 --> 02:52:18.661
volunteers or persons familiar

02:52:18.728 --> 02:52:20.363
with the language but invest

02:52:20.430 --> 02:52:22.198
in our own staffing model

02:52:22.732 --> 02:52:24.701
-- in the in the higher

02:52:24.767 --> 02:52:27.537
certified and qualified multi

02:52:27.603 --> 02:52:29.005
lingual personnel that are

02:52:29.072 --> 02:52:30.907
within our emergency operations

02:52:30.973 --> 02:52:33.476
centers -- because of the

02:52:33.543 --> 02:52:36.679
ability -- so interpretation

02:52:36.746 --> 02:52:37.880
and translation are two

02:52:37.947 --> 02:52:40.516
different things and the skill

02:52:40.583 --> 02:52:42.685
of interpretation is crucial in

02:52:42.752 --> 02:52:44.220
an emergency setting because of

02:52:44.287 --> 02:52:46.923
the ability to transform idioms

02:52:47.323 --> 02:52:49.692
local colloquialisms and other

02:52:49.759 --> 02:52:51.294
cultural specific references

02:52:51.360 --> 02:52:53.563
into analogous statements the

02:52:53.629 --> 02:52:55.398
target audience will understand

02:52:56.032 --> 02:52:58.701
I'm it's just like you cannot

02:52:58.768 --> 02:52:59.902
explain of thought without

02:52:59.969 --> 02:53:01.871
understanding the thought first

02:53:02.071 --> 02:53:03.639
and so if you did not fully

02:53:03.706 --> 02:53:05.575
understand it neither can you

02:53:05.641 --> 02:53:07.510
translate or interpret that

02:53:07.577 --> 02:53:10.012
message -- without the mastery

02:53:10.079 --> 02:53:11.581
of the subject matter related

02:53:11.948 --> 02:53:13.282
and hence the importance of

02:53:13.349 --> 02:53:15.818
certified qualified interpreters

02:53:15.885 --> 02:53:18.020
and translate into translators

02:53:18.554 --> 02:53:19.589
hence the importance of

02:53:19.655 --> 02:53:21.057
cultural relevant teaching

02:53:21.591 --> 02:53:23.059
being crucial in all of our

02:53:23.126 --> 02:53:25.094
preparedness efforts such as

02:53:25.161 --> 02:53:28.264
programs that are state funded

02:53:28.331 --> 02:53:30.032
or state supported through the

02:53:30.099 --> 02:53:31.734
office of California volunteers

02:53:31.801 --> 02:53:33.669
which is the state office I

02:53:33.736 --> 02:53:35.404
like least those for example

02:53:35.471 --> 02:53:36.973
that means ready in Spanish

02:53:37.039 --> 02:53:38.741
and these are grassroots public

02:53:38.808 --> 02:53:41.210
education programs that enhance

02:53:41.277 --> 02:53:43.012
the preparedness efforts taking

02:53:43.079 --> 02:53:44.847
into consideration that cultural

02:53:44.914 --> 02:53:46.949
sensitivity there's the Spanish

02:53:47.016 --> 02:53:48.417
language cert program which

02:53:48.484 --> 02:53:49.852
stands for community emergency

02:53:49.919 --> 02:53:52.155
response teams and then there's

02:53:52.221 --> 02:53:53.890
programs like our local programs

02:53:53.956 --> 02:53:55.625
here the radio ready programs

02:53:55.691 --> 02:53:57.260
that partner with agencies

02:53:57.326 --> 02:53:59.729
that will have of you know live

02:53:59.962 --> 02:54:02.965
broadcasting or or airing and

02:54:03.032 --> 02:54:04.667
and really relay that message

02:54:04.734 --> 02:54:06.402
to these will double populations

02:54:06.469 --> 02:54:08.938
are non English speakers I'm

02:54:09.472 --> 02:54:10.573
I'm gonna leave you with the

02:54:10.973 --> 02:54:12.642
with up well lastly right no one

02:54:12.708 --> 02:54:15.244
is at lunch to seek out to your

02:54:15.311 --> 02:54:17.880
community and include them in

02:54:17.947 --> 02:54:19.615
your local preparedness efforts

02:54:19.682 --> 02:54:21.551
sometimes at an emergency

02:54:22.084 --> 02:54:24.320
of managers level or worry

02:54:24.387 --> 02:54:26.322
within our organization we

02:54:26.389 --> 02:54:27.924
forget to get the communities

02:54:27.990 --> 02:54:29.659
input and what do they want

02:54:29.725 --> 02:54:30.927
how do they want to receive

02:54:30.993 --> 02:54:32.295
this messaging to they rely

02:54:32.361 --> 02:54:34.096
on their phone what is their

02:54:34.163 --> 02:54:35.865
method of communication and

02:54:35.932 --> 02:54:38.067
sometimes it's easy if we

02:54:38.134 --> 02:54:39.969
relate relate to that to build

02:54:40.036 --> 02:54:42.572
the whole community approach

02:54:42.638 --> 02:54:44.607
when up plan for disasters

02:54:45.141 --> 02:54:46.275
nuns again leave the powerful

02:54:46.342 --> 02:54:47.743
phrase that always sticks to me

02:54:47.810 --> 02:54:49.879
by -- Nelson Mandela and it

02:54:49.946 --> 02:54:52.381
says if you speak to a man in a

02:54:52.448 --> 02:54:54.450
language they'll understand but

02:54:54.517 --> 02:54:56.352
if you speak to them in their

02:54:56.419 --> 02:54:58.254
language it will not go to their

02:54:58.321 --> 02:55:00.423
heads but to their hearts think

02:55:03.759 --> 02:55:04.660
thank your image for leaving

02:55:04.727 --> 02:55:06.762
us with that thought are there

02:55:06.829 --> 02:55:08.097
any questions for the panel

02:55:09.565 --> 02:55:11.500
yeah we could just

02:55:12.001 --> 02:55:12.935
throw down a bit with

02:55:13.202 --> 02:55:15.104
with you match on --

02:55:15.605 --> 02:55:16.873
can just go a little further

02:55:16.939 --> 02:55:18.140
on resiliency we talked

02:55:18.207 --> 02:55:20.276
about the cell network on

02:55:20.343 --> 02:55:21.544
the edge of that last panel

02:55:21.611 --> 02:55:23.279
but help us through this bit

02:55:25.615 --> 02:55:27.917
so what thank you ideally

02:55:27.984 --> 02:55:29.151
you would like to be at the

02:55:29.218 --> 02:55:31.320
public safety grade -- for

02:55:31.754 --> 02:55:32.989
what is that what is that mean

02:55:33.055 --> 02:55:34.257
that is a standard that is

02:55:34.323 --> 02:55:36.525
established that -- allows --

02:55:36.592 --> 02:55:38.694
its its premise for what -- the

02:55:38.761 --> 02:55:40.029
hardening in the resiliency of

02:55:40.096 --> 02:55:41.364
of the what you have there so

02:55:42.064 --> 02:55:44.267
-- what you see is --

02:55:45.301 --> 02:55:47.069
on those platforms received

02:55:47.136 --> 02:55:49.472
back up of power sources

02:55:49.538 --> 02:55:51.240
for them you're gonna see --

02:55:51.807 --> 02:55:53.175
gently hardened and structure

02:55:53.242 --> 02:55:55.011
of some type in a sea of

02:55:55.645 --> 02:55:57.713
-- clearance of the sea in

02:55:57.780 --> 02:56:00.249
maintained a for them -- so

02:56:00.316 --> 02:56:01.317
there's in a kind of a whole

02:56:01.384 --> 02:56:02.718
series of those items that are

02:56:02.785 --> 02:56:04.887
there and -- and when you have

02:56:04.954 --> 02:56:07.323
that it obviously helps protect

02:56:07.390 --> 02:56:08.958
-- your cellular infrastructure

02:56:09.025 --> 02:56:10.126
radio infrastructure that you're

02:56:10.192 --> 02:56:12.595
using so -- that's obviously

02:56:12.662 --> 02:56:14.230
the ideal and you want to be

02:56:14.297 --> 02:56:15.798
able to you know for example

02:56:15.865 --> 02:56:18.200
callow yes we divert areas

02:56:18.267 --> 02:56:20.069
we could refill our personal

02:56:20.136 --> 02:56:21.070
network were because we

02:56:21.137 --> 02:56:22.805
support -- the first responder

02:56:22.872 --> 02:56:25.574
community cal fire CHP --

02:56:25.641 --> 02:56:27.310
DOJ's corrections are on our

02:56:27.376 --> 02:56:29.378
on our network calluses network

02:56:29.912 --> 02:56:31.881
-- and our sites -- were without

02:56:31.948 --> 02:56:33.215
power for multiple days and

02:56:33.282 --> 02:56:34.850
so -- you know we have backup

02:56:34.917 --> 02:56:36.052
generators that allow them to

02:56:36.118 --> 02:56:38.454
run -- for long periods of time

02:56:38.521 --> 02:56:40.589
so that they're not going to --

02:56:40.656 --> 02:56:41.791
go down there we didn't have to

02:56:41.857 --> 02:56:43.192
try to race in there to get to

02:56:43.259 --> 02:56:45.061
refuel them in the middle of the

02:56:45.127 --> 02:56:47.229
event -- we had that capacity

02:56:47.296 --> 02:56:48.998
and so on when you have that

02:56:49.065 --> 02:56:50.533
that back up nay capability

02:56:50.599 --> 02:56:52.068
it's certainly helpful and

02:56:52.134 --> 02:56:53.602
so the more resilient whether

02:56:53.669 --> 02:56:55.438
to hurricane or fire your you

02:56:55.504 --> 02:56:56.272
want to make sure that you're

02:56:56.339 --> 02:56:58.441
in a position where -- systems

02:56:58.507 --> 02:57:00.242
are operating in and so in the

02:57:00.309 --> 02:57:02.611
context of SB nine no one I mean

02:57:02.678 --> 02:57:04.380
I I know we sort of went through

02:57:05.147 --> 02:57:06.515
a broad directive to the

02:57:06.582 --> 02:57:07.717
public utilities commission

02:57:07.783 --> 02:57:09.352
about how to interface with

02:57:09.418 --> 02:57:12.288
both I'll use --

02:57:12.655 --> 02:57:14.623
I have I forget the role the PO

02:57:14.690 --> 02:57:16.959
used by no the CCA's also have

02:57:17.026 --> 02:57:18.260
a role to play here I mean are

02:57:18.327 --> 02:57:20.930
they your your your protocols

02:57:20.997 --> 02:57:23.199
are pending right you're still

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:25.001
you're going to publish the

02:57:25.067 --> 02:57:26.469
protocols sorry not under nine

02:57:26.535 --> 02:57:28.471
no one but your recommendations

02:57:28.537 --> 02:57:30.373
later this year early next year

02:57:31.607 --> 02:57:32.775
you for a eight thirty three

02:57:32.842 --> 02:57:34.677
for our guys for before that's

02:57:34.744 --> 02:57:36.379
I work we're gonna have ours

02:57:36.445 --> 02:57:38.514
-- it should be fairly soon we

02:57:38.581 --> 02:57:39.982
we've already drafted -- and

02:57:40.049 --> 02:57:41.517
at the what I would call the

02:57:41.584 --> 02:57:43.252
technical advisory level where

02:57:43.319 --> 02:57:44.754
our locals they've already

02:57:44.820 --> 02:57:46.355
taken a good look at this in a

02:57:46.422 --> 02:57:48.691
been editing the document so we

02:57:48.958 --> 02:57:50.760
we were scheduled to have that

02:57:50.826 --> 02:57:52.228
presented at the Sims here in

02:57:52.294 --> 02:57:53.896
the middle of December I just

02:57:53.963 --> 02:57:55.164
don't know if -- the advisory

02:57:55.231 --> 02:57:57.266
board -- and not sure if that's

02:57:57.333 --> 02:57:58.401
gonna still take place based

02:57:58.467 --> 02:57:59.668
on what our current events

02:57:59.735 --> 02:58:01.103
but just to just to manage

02:58:01.170 --> 02:58:02.371
expectations for the scope of

02:58:02.438 --> 02:58:03.839
that that's a that's voluntary

02:58:03.906 --> 02:58:05.207
guidelines for public emergency

02:58:05.274 --> 02:58:06.909
alerting and warning not

02:58:06.976 --> 02:58:08.277
necessarily gonna touch on this

02:58:08.344 --> 02:58:10.146
resiliency question correct it

02:58:10.212 --> 02:58:12.515
it's it's it's more about best

02:58:12.581 --> 02:58:13.949
practice -- Acosta locals to

02:58:14.016 --> 02:58:16.052
utilize that's correct okay so

02:58:17.253 --> 02:58:19.021
really it's a Browning this

02:58:19.088 --> 02:58:20.389
conversation would got its start

02:58:20.456 --> 02:58:22.124
maybe engaging the PC or those

02:58:22.191 --> 02:58:24.226
on the on the who can actually

02:58:24.527 --> 02:58:27.363
require or -- interface with

02:58:27.430 --> 02:58:29.131
our telcos in our utilities

02:58:29.198 --> 02:58:30.900
in terms of that resiliency

02:58:30.966 --> 02:58:33.002
planning that is actually

02:58:33.069 --> 02:58:34.703
correct and we -- have met with

02:58:34.937 --> 02:58:36.505
the CPC and continue to work

02:58:36.572 --> 02:58:38.240
with them okay great thank you

02:58:39.909 --> 02:58:40.943
thank you yes I think there's

02:58:41.010 --> 02:58:42.111
a lot more in the hardening

02:58:42.178 --> 02:58:43.879
level I think of our cell

02:58:43.946 --> 02:58:45.748
phone companies I've heard I've

02:58:45.815 --> 02:58:46.882
heard that mentioned several

02:58:46.949 --> 02:58:49.151
times that they've got a step

02:58:49.218 --> 02:58:51.087
up here and help they're one

02:58:51.153 --> 02:58:52.388
of the primary sources of

02:58:52.455 --> 02:58:54.356
information I'm not sure that

02:58:54.423 --> 02:58:56.025
SB nine a one included them

02:58:56.092 --> 02:58:57.293
per se it might been the power

02:58:57.359 --> 02:58:59.662
companies but they have been --

02:59:00.229 --> 02:59:03.165
noticeably silent in their

02:59:03.466 --> 02:59:05.367
-- participation and it's

02:59:05.434 --> 02:59:06.869
my hope that they will step

02:59:06.936 --> 02:59:10.005
up -- before the legislature

02:59:10.506 --> 02:59:13.142
-- requires that they do so

02:59:13.209 --> 02:59:15.010
since they are clearly now

02:59:15.077 --> 02:59:17.046
part of this whole emergency

02:59:17.113 --> 02:59:19.849
notification process -- I

02:59:19.915 --> 02:59:21.350
wonder if the other people

02:59:21.417 --> 02:59:23.886
who spoke if anyone has --

02:59:23.953 --> 02:59:26.255
any thoughts about that war I

02:59:26.322 --> 02:59:27.790
did I did have a couple of quick

02:59:27.857 --> 02:59:30.426
questions -- I know we've we're

02:59:30.493 --> 02:59:32.661
running over in our colleague

02:59:32.728 --> 02:59:34.330
-- assemblymember Levine had

02:59:34.396 --> 02:59:36.599
to go to catch a plane -- but

02:59:36.665 --> 02:59:37.833
I think this is still very

02:59:37.900 --> 02:59:39.635
important we're not done yet

02:59:39.702 --> 02:59:41.370
we've got debris flow pot

02:59:41.437 --> 02:59:43.739
potential up and down the state

02:59:44.106 --> 02:59:45.875
-- rains coming this is all

02:59:45.941 --> 02:59:48.177
very I think urgent and media

02:59:48.878 --> 02:59:50.446
is solemn for anyone on the

02:59:50.513 --> 02:59:53.115
panel -- it is anyone thinking

02:59:53.182 --> 02:59:55.384
about alert and warning systems

02:59:55.451 --> 02:59:57.419
like cell phone tax that --

02:59:57.486 --> 02:59:59.155
cam and confirm receipt or

02:59:59.221 --> 03:00:01.857
identify -- causes why the lower

03:00:01.924 --> 03:00:03.459
alerts are not being received

03:00:03.526 --> 03:00:04.560
so that we make sure everybody

03:00:04.627 --> 03:00:07.096
gets that information Sir any

03:00:07.463 --> 03:00:09.231
anything being done to address

03:00:09.298 --> 03:00:11.433
that problem for that conserve

03:00:13.836 --> 03:00:15.804
senators and members -- -- I

03:00:15.871 --> 03:00:17.439
guess I would add to what you're

03:00:17.506 --> 03:00:18.974
suggesting that the the cell

03:00:19.041 --> 03:00:21.010
companies responsiveness in

03:00:21.076 --> 03:00:23.112
that we have vast -- questions

03:00:23.679 --> 03:00:25.080
and of the cell companies on

03:00:25.147 --> 03:00:26.982
why certain things are happening

03:00:27.316 --> 03:00:28.617
why there were certain failures

03:00:28.684 --> 03:00:29.952
and unfortunately we don't get

03:00:30.019 --> 03:00:31.587
those responses I'm not sure

03:00:31.820 --> 03:00:33.222
what the requirements of a cell

03:00:33.289 --> 03:00:34.623
company already to go and do

03:00:34.690 --> 03:00:36.759
researcher report back to who

03:00:36.825 --> 03:00:38.894
or what -- let me give a couple

03:00:38.961 --> 03:00:40.896
examples during the -- one

03:00:40.963 --> 03:00:42.998
nine debris flow the National

03:00:43.065 --> 03:00:45.100
Weather Service issued a we --

03:00:45.634 --> 03:00:47.536
of flash flood warning but

03:00:47.803 --> 03:00:49.705
it did not seem to go out we

03:00:49.772 --> 03:00:51.974
don't know exactly to -- one

03:00:52.041 --> 03:00:53.976
of the provider companies --

03:00:54.043 --> 03:00:55.311
so there was a big hole in the

03:00:55.377 --> 03:00:57.646
system -- that we don't know

03:00:57.713 --> 03:00:59.081
exactly why that happened and

03:00:59.148 --> 03:01:00.649
then there's -- during the

03:01:00.716 --> 03:01:03.185
presidential alert -- we

03:01:03.252 --> 03:01:04.920
experience that several phones

03:01:05.187 --> 03:01:06.789
in this big meeting we're having

03:01:06.855 --> 03:01:08.190
did not activate including one

03:01:08.257 --> 03:01:10.259
of mine -- both of my phones

03:01:10.326 --> 03:01:11.460
have the same provider but one

03:01:11.527 --> 03:01:12.761
activating the other didn't

03:01:13.162 --> 03:01:14.563
we've asked a question about why

03:01:14.630 --> 03:01:17.132
so there's I think part of it

03:01:17.199 --> 03:01:18.901
just not just hardening but also

03:01:18.968 --> 03:01:20.769
understanding and looking at

03:01:20.836 --> 03:01:22.238
the technology to try to figure

03:01:22.304 --> 03:01:24.373
out where these problems are

03:01:25.007 --> 03:01:27.309
-- a -- retired fire chief in

03:01:27.376 --> 03:01:28.611
Santa Barbara City we're all

03:01:28.677 --> 03:01:31.513
fond of a path not gray was --

03:01:31.580 --> 03:01:33.916
asks why we can't have a read

03:01:34.149 --> 03:01:36.452
a -- system that works to the

03:01:36.518 --> 03:01:37.987
same level of uber and lift

03:01:38.053 --> 03:01:39.288
where when you need a fire

03:01:39.355 --> 03:01:40.656
engine it goes and sees where

03:01:40.723 --> 03:01:42.324
you're out in response to in

03:01:42.391 --> 03:01:44.593
the same sort of method Alaska

03:01:44.660 --> 03:01:45.961
another question why can't we

03:01:46.028 --> 03:01:47.329
have learning system instead

03:01:47.396 --> 03:01:49.398
is based on cell towers but

03:01:49.465 --> 03:01:51.000
instead is based on the GPS

03:01:51.066 --> 03:01:52.835
of your telephone that instead

03:01:52.901 --> 03:01:55.337
of sending it out all over and

03:01:55.404 --> 03:01:57.239
hitting different -- bleeding

03:01:57.306 --> 03:01:59.308
over other system why is there

03:01:59.375 --> 03:02:01.010
a technology I've no idea that

03:02:01.076 --> 03:02:03.379
could hit target people that are

03:02:03.445 --> 03:02:05.247
in those areas just in the same

03:02:05.314 --> 03:02:06.749
way that other systems that we

03:02:06.815 --> 03:02:08.550
currently have do they certainly

03:02:08.617 --> 03:02:10.019
target you to show you a pair

03:02:10.085 --> 03:02:12.521
of shoes and they also target

03:02:12.588 --> 03:02:15.124
you -- when you're in another

03:02:15.190 --> 03:02:17.459
location I was in Chicago over

03:02:17.726 --> 03:02:19.995
thanksgiving for share with my

03:02:20.062 --> 03:02:22.264
grand kids and I was getting

03:02:22.331 --> 03:02:23.732
all sorts of advertisements

03:02:23.799 --> 03:02:24.833
about all the stuff I could

03:02:24.900 --> 03:02:27.036
buy in Chicago I'd not given

03:02:27.102 --> 03:02:28.537
them permission I didn't know

03:02:28.604 --> 03:02:30.039
how they knew it but they do

03:02:30.472 --> 03:02:32.041
and I think -- I think you know

03:02:32.107 --> 03:02:33.342
obviously there's a lot of money

03:02:33.409 --> 03:02:35.544
associated with that those kinds

03:02:35.611 --> 03:02:37.613
of efforts and -- hopefully they

03:02:37.680 --> 03:02:39.982
will be a little more responsive

03:02:40.049 --> 03:02:41.517
when it comes to saving lives

03:02:41.583 --> 03:02:42.618
in the public safety of the

03:02:42.685 --> 03:02:43.986
people in the communities

03:02:44.053 --> 03:02:45.354
that they are also serving

03:02:46.021 --> 03:02:47.856
so appreciate that you are

03:02:47.923 --> 03:02:49.058
absolutely right that those

03:02:49.124 --> 03:02:50.459
kinds of things I'm sure are

03:02:50.526 --> 03:02:51.593
available they know where you

03:02:51.660 --> 03:02:53.929
are all the time chisel creepy

03:02:53.996 --> 03:02:56.165
but but they do know this and

03:02:56.231 --> 03:02:57.499
certainly there there should

03:02:57.566 --> 03:02:59.768
be upper opportunities and

03:03:00.235 --> 03:03:02.004
-- it's not the desire than at

03:03:02.071 --> 03:03:03.339
least some sort of incentive

03:03:03.405 --> 03:03:04.940
for them to step up on this

03:03:05.174 --> 03:03:06.208
and that and eight I would be

03:03:06.275 --> 03:03:07.910
remiss if I didn't also mention

03:03:08.243 --> 03:03:09.645
that they are very responsive

03:03:09.712 --> 03:03:11.447
during an emergency to trying

03:03:11.513 --> 03:03:13.015
to help first responders

03:03:13.082 --> 03:03:14.850
are communicate and all of

03:03:14.917 --> 03:03:16.785
that is greatly value well

03:03:17.986 --> 03:03:20.122
that's wonderful to hear and

03:03:20.189 --> 03:03:21.824
obviously once you're in the

03:03:21.890 --> 03:03:23.625
emergency getting that help is

03:03:23.692 --> 03:03:25.661
critical but also we we talk

03:03:25.728 --> 03:03:26.995
about those warnings to get

03:03:27.062 --> 03:03:29.365
people to safety -- we've got

03:03:29.431 --> 03:03:31.333
extend that debt responsibility

03:03:31.400 --> 03:03:32.668
as well would seem to me

03:03:33.369 --> 03:03:35.537
-- last question I have is

03:03:36.372 --> 03:03:38.374
-- how do we structure a public

03:03:38.440 --> 03:03:39.842
warning system that allows the

03:03:39.908 --> 03:03:42.277
public to follow up and to ask

03:03:42.344 --> 03:03:44.146
questions in a way that doesn't

03:03:44.413 --> 03:03:46.982
involve calling nine one one --

03:03:47.049 --> 03:03:49.752
because I know during the -- --

03:03:49.952 --> 03:03:50.986
I can't remember what part of

03:03:51.053 --> 03:03:52.554
the Thomas fire two thirty in

03:03:52.621 --> 03:03:54.256
the morning I got a we a call

03:03:54.957 --> 03:03:57.292
-- didn't tell me much except

03:03:57.359 --> 03:03:59.094
that there was a fire didn't

03:03:59.161 --> 03:04:00.496
say where didn't say what

03:04:01.330 --> 03:04:02.431
in my temptation was to

03:04:02.498 --> 03:04:05.134
call -- markedly duty

03:04:05.200 --> 03:04:07.035
because I am on speed dial

03:04:07.536 --> 03:04:09.605
of not a good plan at two

03:04:09.671 --> 03:04:10.639
thirty in the morning but I

03:04:10.706 --> 03:04:12.074
was awakened and I wanted to

03:04:12.141 --> 03:04:13.075
know what was happening and

03:04:13.142 --> 03:04:14.309
I suspect everybody in the

03:04:14.376 --> 03:04:16.879
community had those same --

03:04:16.945 --> 03:04:18.280
anxieties but didn't have

03:04:18.347 --> 03:04:20.983
his phone number so I think

03:04:21.049 --> 03:04:22.718
that that's a question that

03:04:22.985 --> 03:04:24.319
would be helpful if we could

03:04:24.386 --> 03:04:25.988
get some kind of indication

03:04:26.054 --> 03:04:27.389
whether that follow up type

03:04:27.456 --> 03:04:29.191
system is being considered is

03:04:29.258 --> 03:04:31.760
available or should be part of

03:04:31.827 --> 03:04:33.262
our discussion going forward

03:04:34.196 --> 03:04:36.064
chairs that kept me going again

03:04:36.131 --> 03:04:37.166
from mentor county office of

03:04:37.232 --> 03:04:39.802
emergency services so currently

03:04:40.002 --> 03:04:41.470
I don't know about that

03:04:41.537 --> 03:04:43.972
technological capability of

03:04:44.206 --> 03:04:46.442
-- like a push receive type of

03:04:46.508 --> 03:04:47.910
the notification system in that

03:04:47.976 --> 03:04:50.479
sense we do get analytics back

03:04:50.546 --> 03:04:52.681
on our on our hosted system

03:04:52.748 --> 03:04:54.383
the BC alert where we can see

03:04:54.450 --> 03:04:55.751
people had received the message

03:04:55.818 --> 03:04:57.719
when they -- select different

03:04:57.786 --> 03:04:59.021
-- different options once

03:04:59.087 --> 03:05:00.889
they get the message a how we

03:05:00.956 --> 03:05:03.592
address that a very topic though

03:05:03.859 --> 03:05:05.761
is we establish a call center

03:05:06.094 --> 03:05:08.030
-- it it does two things one it

03:05:08.096 --> 03:05:10.065
alleviates pressure off of our

03:05:10.132 --> 03:05:12.568
-- safety access points are nine

03:05:12.634 --> 03:05:15.137
one system -- which is hugely

03:05:15.204 --> 03:05:16.371
important because people still

03:05:16.438 --> 03:05:17.406
need to call nine one one when

03:05:17.473 --> 03:05:18.907
they're having a heart attack --

03:05:18.974 --> 03:05:20.209
while the fires occurring right

03:05:20.275 --> 03:05:23.011
so we -- establish immediately

03:05:23.078 --> 03:05:24.713
when we issue evacuation orders

03:05:24.780 --> 03:05:26.248
or shelter in place orders in

03:05:26.315 --> 03:05:27.549
Ventura county we established

03:05:27.616 --> 03:05:29.518
that -- emergency hotline

03:05:29.952 --> 03:05:31.053
and then we also have the

03:05:31.119 --> 03:05:32.421
website where people can get

03:05:32.488 --> 03:05:34.323
information and we push those

03:05:34.690 --> 03:05:36.692
-- passive systems through that

03:05:36.758 --> 03:05:38.293
emergency notification system

03:05:38.360 --> 03:05:40.162
so as they're getting those BC

03:05:40.229 --> 03:05:41.964
alerts or the wireless emergency

03:05:42.030 --> 03:05:43.432
alerts they're getting follow

03:05:43.499 --> 03:05:44.733
up information that says go

03:05:44.800 --> 03:05:46.235
to these different sources

03:05:46.301 --> 03:05:48.804
for additional information and

03:05:48.871 --> 03:05:50.539
we actually use the caller ID

03:05:50.606 --> 03:05:52.608
number for RBC alert system

03:05:52.674 --> 03:05:54.176
as the call center number

03:05:54.243 --> 03:05:55.477
so some people will just be

03:05:55.544 --> 03:05:57.546
able to hit re dial or a you

03:05:57.613 --> 03:05:59.081
know call back that caller ID

03:05:59.147 --> 03:06:00.649
number and they'll get routed

03:06:00.716 --> 03:06:02.417
directly to our -- call center

03:06:06.522 --> 03:06:07.990
all right do we have

03:06:08.056 --> 03:06:08.924
anyone else who wants

03:06:08.991 --> 03:06:11.126
to respond guess

03:06:15.531 --> 03:06:17.799
cation we asked the the

03:06:17.866 --> 03:06:20.402
residents if they have a need

03:06:20.469 --> 03:06:21.603
or systems to get out of their

03:06:21.670 --> 03:06:23.906
home to contact us and writing

03:06:23.972 --> 03:06:24.940
a refer as well because it was

03:06:25.007 --> 03:06:26.108
an issue that came up on the

03:06:26.174 --> 03:06:28.277
rim fire was how many ambulances

03:06:28.343 --> 03:06:29.778
buses or whatever also may need

03:06:29.845 --> 03:06:31.747
for people that can't walk that

03:06:31.813 --> 03:06:33.415
they were were car assistance

03:06:33.482 --> 03:06:35.384
getting out of the home -- what

03:06:35.450 --> 03:06:36.718
would be nice if there was a way

03:06:36.785 --> 03:06:39.021
to a one stop shop if you will

03:06:39.087 --> 03:06:40.188
for somebody to it whether it's

03:06:40.255 --> 03:06:41.823
physicians in hotel services

03:06:41.890 --> 03:06:43.225
to provide that information to

03:06:43.292 --> 03:06:44.960
law enforcement so that we we

03:06:45.027 --> 03:06:46.061
have that information readily

03:06:46.128 --> 03:06:47.563
available when we draw our map

03:06:47.963 --> 03:06:49.765
of the impacted area to say okay

03:06:49.831 --> 03:06:50.999
I'm gonna need six ambulances

03:06:51.066 --> 03:06:52.401
to get these people out area so

03:06:52.467 --> 03:06:53.268
that would be some we would like

03:06:53.335 --> 03:06:55.103
to see as well thank you very

03:06:55.170 --> 03:06:58.073
interesting all right -- yes

03:06:58.140 --> 03:07:00.309
Mister yeah account center check

03:07:00.375 --> 03:07:01.944
such wonder does he won party

03:07:02.010 --> 03:07:03.011
thing there there's a couple

03:07:03.078 --> 03:07:05.380
conversations on on accuracy and

03:07:05.447 --> 03:07:06.548
for that information and some

03:07:06.615 --> 03:07:07.716
of the technologies was going

03:07:07.783 --> 03:07:09.885
on there ma'am the FCC controls

03:07:09.952 --> 03:07:11.787
location accuracy and this is an

03:07:11.853 --> 03:07:13.322
area that -- your support when

03:07:13.388 --> 03:07:14.189
you're talking with our federal

03:07:14.256 --> 03:07:15.624
counterparts could be helpful

03:07:15.924 --> 03:07:17.326
to remind them to continue to

03:07:17.392 --> 03:07:18.860
improve our location accuracy

03:07:18.927 --> 03:07:20.495
whether it's calling nine one

03:07:20.562 --> 03:07:22.564
one or the ability to broadcast

03:07:22.631 --> 03:07:24.099
signal backwards on same

03:07:24.166 --> 03:07:25.667
cellular network -- for that

03:07:25.734 --> 03:07:27.803
same location accuracy Mitch cam

03:07:27.869 --> 03:07:29.471
just as commission fall here Sir

03:07:29.538 --> 03:07:32.240
-- what what does it just

03:07:32.808 --> 03:07:34.042
in lightness in terms the we

03:07:34.109 --> 03:07:35.911
advocacy Prosser with the stage

03:07:35.978 --> 03:07:37.079
it is there are there Senate

03:07:37.145 --> 03:07:38.747
guidelines have been published

03:07:39.047 --> 03:07:40.515
that folks are commenting on now

03:07:40.582 --> 03:07:42.050
like how how does that process

03:07:42.117 --> 03:07:43.952
actually worked to hitting

03:07:44.019 --> 03:07:46.521
at twenty nineteen deadline

03:07:46.588 --> 03:07:48.590
coming up and then as well as

03:07:48.657 --> 03:07:50.459
sort of this FCC side like is

03:07:50.525 --> 03:07:52.361
this is this all locked in or

03:07:52.427 --> 03:07:54.229
is it influx could go faster

03:07:54.296 --> 03:07:55.931
potentially you know are we

03:07:55.998 --> 03:07:57.633
gonna have formal opportunities

03:07:57.699 --> 03:08:00.002
to reshape this or is it just

03:08:00.068 --> 03:08:01.903
sort of on track and going

03:08:03.138 --> 03:08:05.674
the the from from the

03:08:05.741 --> 03:08:06.842
sampling from Calloway's

03:08:06.908 --> 03:08:08.043
producing those guidelines were

03:08:08.110 --> 03:08:09.578
on track and work and that night

03:08:09.645 --> 03:08:11.079
that you -- the federal process

03:08:11.146 --> 03:08:12.547
on the federal side yes yes

03:08:12.614 --> 03:08:14.549
the the federal process for for

03:08:14.616 --> 03:08:17.285
improving -- location

03:08:17.352 --> 03:08:20.155
accuracy is is -- is has been

03:08:20.222 --> 03:08:21.223
said they're not they have not

03:08:21.289 --> 03:08:22.724
adjusted their time lines to

03:08:22.791 --> 03:08:25.360
increase that so -- we obviously

03:08:25.427 --> 03:08:26.628
would prefer them there there's

03:08:26.695 --> 03:08:28.130
currently no mandate to actually

03:08:28.196 --> 03:08:30.265
go to a hundred percent so --

03:08:30.332 --> 03:08:31.533
they're they're they having set

03:08:31.600 --> 03:08:33.068
their target at in our level

03:08:33.135 --> 03:08:34.269
where you're going to guarantee

03:08:34.603 --> 03:08:35.570
that portion of the let alone

03:08:35.637 --> 03:08:37.372
the the more we talk about the

03:08:37.439 --> 03:08:39.074
Z. axis for vertical axis for

03:08:39.141 --> 03:08:41.510
you -- that's -- we're just

03:08:41.576 --> 03:08:43.178
one X. Y. I know where you're

03:08:43.245 --> 03:08:45.113
out on the ground and can target

03:08:45.180 --> 03:08:46.748
Chiu a properly on your call

03:08:46.815 --> 03:08:48.116
and get you complete located

03:08:48.183 --> 03:08:50.185
there so and the reason assure

03:08:50.252 --> 03:08:51.820
that is because the the you

03:08:52.054 --> 03:08:53.722
you reverse frame the question

03:08:53.789 --> 03:08:54.990
of what can I similar back

03:08:55.057 --> 03:08:56.692
out to the individual and and

03:08:56.758 --> 03:08:57.726
so because hand in hand with

03:08:57.793 --> 03:08:58.994
the same location accuracy

03:09:00.595 --> 03:09:01.596
and that's not a part of the

03:09:01.663 --> 03:09:03.031
we update process though that's

03:09:03.098 --> 03:09:05.667
a separate process within FCC

03:09:06.068 --> 03:09:07.302
that's it that's outside and

03:09:07.369 --> 03:09:08.770
who's who's overseeing the the

03:09:08.837 --> 03:09:11.006
we update is that going to DHS

03:09:11.840 --> 03:09:13.675
it is sent and we work on the

03:09:13.742 --> 03:09:14.810
aye plus our household that

03:09:14.876 --> 03:09:16.645
that whole program is working

03:09:16.712 --> 03:09:17.612
-- through that through the

03:09:17.679 --> 03:09:19.648
DHS silence I think that might

03:09:19.715 --> 03:09:21.083
be something we can pursue a

03:09:21.149 --> 03:09:22.417
little bit further what we can

03:09:22.484 --> 03:09:23.819
do is a state we do have some

03:09:23.885 --> 03:09:26.922
limitations -- certainly there

03:09:26.988 --> 03:09:27.923
are things that we need to

03:09:27.989 --> 03:09:30.125
do going forward if we can

03:09:30.192 --> 03:09:31.693
jurisdictional a we may not be

03:09:31.760 --> 03:09:33.295
able to but to the extent we

03:09:33.361 --> 03:09:34.663
do a jurisdiction that would be

03:09:34.730 --> 03:09:37.032
helpful so we have run a little

03:09:37.099 --> 03:09:39.101
bit late but it's time to thank

03:09:39.167 --> 03:09:41.103
you very much I I hope it's been

03:09:41.169 --> 03:09:42.771
is helpful for you is I think

03:09:42.838 --> 03:09:44.005
it's been for those of us here

03:09:44.072 --> 03:09:45.674
in the días and hopefully for

03:09:45.741 --> 03:09:48.410
people who are -- watching us

03:09:48.844 --> 03:09:51.313
online -- it we will take public

03:09:51.379 --> 03:09:53.415
comment now if there is any

03:09:53.682 --> 03:09:56.051
-- sixty seconds hot but

03:09:56.118 --> 03:09:57.319
may I see how many people are

03:09:57.385 --> 03:09:59.588
public up we have -- at least

03:09:59.654 --> 03:10:01.389
three four will give you a

03:10:01.456 --> 03:10:03.558
two minutes each and I will

03:10:03.759 --> 03:10:05.594
I will bang down the gavel at

03:10:05.660 --> 03:10:06.862
the end of that two minutes so

03:10:06.928 --> 03:10:08.130
why don't you come on up give

03:10:08.196 --> 03:10:10.198
us your name affiliation and

03:10:10.265 --> 03:10:12.801
-- -- your two minutes

03:10:13.668 --> 03:10:14.970
good afternoon I'm Richard

03:10:15.036 --> 03:10:16.371
road when I'm vice chair of

03:10:16.438 --> 03:10:18.673
the California emergency alert

03:10:18.740 --> 03:10:20.809
system state committee and is

03:10:20.876 --> 03:10:22.711
your single point of contact

03:10:23.345 --> 03:10:25.814
for broadcast radio television

03:10:25.881 --> 03:10:28.250
and cable as far as -- emergency

03:10:28.316 --> 03:10:29.518
warnings that go over the

03:10:29.584 --> 03:10:31.486
air or come through the cable

03:10:32.320 --> 03:10:34.489
-- there over is over a

03:10:34.556 --> 03:10:36.024
half century of research

03:10:36.091 --> 03:10:38.627
that says that reinforcement

03:10:38.693 --> 03:10:41.163
is important to get --

03:10:41.730 --> 03:10:43.298
a public at risk to act

03:10:43.899 --> 03:10:45.066
in reinforcement comes

03:10:45.133 --> 03:10:46.034
through multiple warning

03:10:46.101 --> 03:10:47.969
sources multiple messages

03:10:48.403 --> 03:10:49.704
and -- coordinated

03:10:49.771 --> 03:10:52.407
information release --

03:10:52.707 --> 03:10:55.143
the -- this is

03:10:55.710 --> 03:10:57.679
going back to something that

03:10:57.746 --> 03:10:59.114
is kind of low tech like

03:10:59.181 --> 03:11:01.049
broadcasting is important when

03:11:01.116 --> 03:11:02.651
the infrastructure is impaired

03:11:03.285 --> 03:11:05.320
it also provides a feedback loop

03:11:05.387 --> 03:11:06.955
if you have relationships with

03:11:07.022 --> 03:11:09.391
local broadcasters so that when

03:11:09.457 --> 03:11:11.693
-- -- they go all emergency all

03:11:11.760 --> 03:11:13.862
the time people have a way to

03:11:13.929 --> 03:11:16.531
-- -- get on the air

03:11:16.798 --> 03:11:18.633
in the broadcasters can actually

03:11:18.834 --> 03:11:19.835
if they're monitored by the

03:11:19.901 --> 03:11:21.436
emergency management community

03:11:21.503 --> 03:11:23.438
can -- get a handle on what's

03:11:23.505 --> 03:11:24.973
going on out in the field

03:11:26.074 --> 03:11:28.543
-- within the two minute limit

03:11:28.610 --> 03:11:30.879
on going to say is I have a

03:11:30.946 --> 03:11:32.948
hand out I'm gonna leave with --

03:11:33.548 --> 03:11:35.183
with you about draft best

03:11:35.250 --> 03:11:36.885
practices for local emergency

03:11:36.952 --> 03:11:39.521
public information and --

03:11:39.588 --> 03:11:41.456
I think I'm gonna leave it

03:11:41.523 --> 03:11:43.491
there and -- anybody wants to

03:11:43.558 --> 03:11:45.160
speak to be off line I'm very

03:11:45.227 --> 03:11:46.595
much available on the contact

03:11:46.661 --> 03:11:47.996
information is on here and

03:11:48.063 --> 03:11:49.097
I think a major two minute

03:11:49.164 --> 03:11:51.099
limit thank you and thank you

03:11:51.166 --> 03:11:52.200
for your good work on this

03:11:52.267 --> 03:11:53.935
issue will look forward to the

03:11:54.002 --> 03:11:56.638
documentation next my name

03:11:56.705 --> 03:11:57.639
is Brian could on the vice

03:11:57.706 --> 03:11:59.341
president IBM which is emergency

03:11:59.407 --> 03:12:00.675
management consulting company

03:12:00.742 --> 03:12:02.277
I also previously served as the

03:12:02.344 --> 03:12:03.511
director of emergency management

03:12:03.578 --> 03:12:05.113
for the state of Florida --

03:12:05.180 --> 03:12:06.514
for seven years until the end

03:12:06.581 --> 03:12:08.717
of last year -- Florida faced

03:12:08.783 --> 03:12:09.851
in faces many this similar

03:12:09.918 --> 03:12:11.152
challenge the California does

03:12:11.219 --> 03:12:12.921
in terms of large population

03:12:12.988 --> 03:12:15.323
rural and urban divide -- and

03:12:15.390 --> 03:12:16.458
the number of hazards as well

03:12:16.524 --> 03:12:17.459
as areas they're difficult

03:12:17.525 --> 03:12:19.261
to evacuate -- so a couple

03:12:19.327 --> 03:12:20.262
of recommendations based on

03:12:20.328 --> 03:12:21.663
my experience in Florida one

03:12:21.730 --> 03:12:23.732
is -- insured as Lilly Anna

03:12:23.798 --> 03:12:25.433
said to be citizen centric and

03:12:25.500 --> 03:12:26.434
think about all the different

03:12:26.501 --> 03:12:28.136
ways that your Californians

03:12:28.203 --> 03:12:30.272
receive information so aside

03:12:30.338 --> 03:12:31.706
from city county government

03:12:31.773 --> 03:12:32.674
state government they'll also

03:12:32.741 --> 03:12:34.309
be receiving information from

03:12:34.376 --> 03:12:36.344
schools colleges universities

03:12:36.611 --> 03:12:38.413
-- your tourist attractions

03:12:38.680 --> 03:12:40.181
a utilities so you wanna make

03:12:40.248 --> 03:12:41.149
sure that you coordinate your

03:12:41.216 --> 03:12:42.617
policies and your messaging

03:12:42.984 --> 03:12:44.386
-- ahead of time so they don't

03:12:44.452 --> 03:12:45.854
receive conflicting information

03:12:45.921 --> 03:12:47.188
because conflicting information

03:12:47.255 --> 03:12:48.857
leads to friction in their back

03:12:48.924 --> 03:12:50.125
you Asian process which can

03:12:50.191 --> 03:12:51.693
lead to death so bringing more

03:12:51.760 --> 03:12:52.727
people to the table at this

03:12:52.794 --> 03:12:54.729
stage -- will greatly enhance

03:12:54.796 --> 03:12:56.398
your effort -- the second thing

development and legislation --

03:13:02.671 --> 03:13:03.772
is everything you can do at the

03:13:03.838 --> 03:13:05.507
state level to help support in

03:13:05.573 --> 03:13:07.509
terms of policy development --

03:13:07.575 --> 03:13:08.944
in terms of funding in terms

03:13:09.010 --> 03:13:10.912
of marketing outreach education

03:13:10.979 --> 03:13:12.480
to help citizens understand

03:13:12.847 --> 03:13:14.149
-- what the systems can and

03:13:14.215 --> 03:13:15.684
cannot do and what their role

03:13:15.750 --> 03:13:16.584
will be when they receive

03:13:16.651 --> 03:13:18.286
this information -- and then

03:13:18.353 --> 03:13:19.421
making sure that they'll the

03:13:19.487 --> 03:13:20.488
local governments have the

03:13:20.555 --> 03:13:22.090
operational control it it's a

03:13:22.157 --> 03:13:23.425
very important at the locals be

03:13:23.491 --> 03:13:24.526

03:13:24.592 --> 03:13:26.161
for their communities that you

03:13:26.227 --> 03:13:27.295
do everything you can at the

03:13:27.362 --> 03:13:28.697
state level to empower their

03:13:28.763 --> 03:13:30.165
ability to do that we found

03:13:30.231 --> 03:13:31.232
that to be the most effective

03:13:31.299 --> 03:13:32.934
relationship -- and I think --

03:13:33.001 --> 03:13:34.002

-- my biggest concern is about

03:13:57.192 --> 03:13:58.426
the disturbance of ancestors

03:13:58.493 --> 03:13:59.728
are buried in when we have fire

03:13:59.794 --> 03:14:01.029

to my test low stencil --

03:14:15.710 --> 03:14:16.678
but one of the issues that

03:14:16.745 --> 03:14:17.846
we've discovered of the past

03:14:17.912 --> 03:14:19.080
couple years is that we've been

03:14:19.147 --> 03:14:20.348

if what we are doing our best

03:19:40.668 --> 03:19:41.803
and I think it's important that

03:19:41.869 --> 03:19:43.571
that message get out there that

03:19:43.638 --> 03:19:45.506
we are working together -- the

03:19:45.573 --> 03:19:46.841
we're going to do our best that

03:19:46.908 --> 03:19:49.110
we are going to try to include

03:19:49.177 --> 03:19:51.546
the public create best practices

03:19:51.746 --> 03:19:53.147
and deal with the situation as

03:19:53.214 --> 03:19:55.383
best as is humanly possible so

03:19:55.450 --> 03:19:56.551
with that I want to thank all

03:19:56.617 --> 03:19:58.219
of you for being here thank

03:19:58.286 --> 03:19:59.253
you for your good work there

03:19:59.320 --> 03:20:00.855
will be more to come they'll

03:20:00.922 --> 03:20:02.357
be more that we can try to do

03:20:02.423 --> 03:20:04.192
legislatively collaboratively

03:20:04.258 --> 03:20:06.427
working together as communities

03:20:06.494 --> 03:20:08.663
as a state is a country -- as

03:20:08.730 --> 03:20:10.698
a planet to deal with the ever

03:20:10.765 --> 03:20:12.700
changing climate and of the

03:20:12.767 --> 03:20:14.535
dramatic circumstances that are

03:20:14.602 --> 03:20:16.337
being generated from that so

03:20:16.637 --> 03:20:18.673
thank you all and -- we are now

03:20:19.173 --> 03:20:20.975
adjourned we do have I suspect

03:20:21.042 --> 03:20:22.410

03:20:22.477 --> 03:20:23.544
