00:06:25.785 --> 00:06:28.554

00:06:28.621 --> 00:06:30.389
LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE ISSUE

00:06:30.456 --> 00:06:31.958

00:06:32.024 --> 00:06:32.959
SAFETY ISSUES.

00:06:33.025 --> 00:06:33.893
ARE OUT LOT COVERAGE HAS

00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:37.130
EVERYTHING TO DO WITH THE SAFETY

00:06:37.196 --> 00:06:39.499

WELLINGS NEXT DOOR SO I DON'T

00:06:47.573 --> 00:06:48.574
THINK OF I THINK IT'S AWFULLY

00:06:48.641 --> 00:06:50.810
SIMPLISTIC TO SAY THAT THE FIRE.

00:06:50.877 --> 00:06:51.878
FOLKS WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE ON

00:06:51.944 --> 00:06:53.179

THE ZONING.

00:06:54.013 --> 00:06:55.381
SO THAT REALLY NEEDS A DEEPER

00:06:55.448 --> 00:06:56.649
DIVE A STRONGER LOOK AT WHETHER

00:06:56.716 --> 00:06:58.718
THAT CAN BE SOMETHING THAT

00:06:58.785 --> 00:06:59.819
FUNDING MEDICALLY MINISTERIAL

00:06:59.886 --> 00:07:02.321
LEE -- EXEMPTED BECAUSE THE IT

00:07:02.388 --> 00:07:05.124
HAS AFFECTED OUR PROPERTIES IN

00:07:05.191 --> 00:07:05.691
LAGUNA BEACH WITH THE FIRES

00:07:05.758 --> 00:07:06.025
THERE.

00:07:06.092 --> 00:07:07.860
MIGHT REMEMBER THE THE DEBATE

00:07:07.927 --> 00:07:08.694
THAT WENT ON REGARDING GRANNY

00:07:08.761 --> 00:07:09.929
FLAT SO WHEN THAT WAS BEING

00:07:09.996 --> 00:07:11.430
INCORPORATED YOU MAY NOT BECAUSE

00:07:11.497 --> 00:07:13.533
THAT WAS BACK IN.

00:07:13.599 --> 00:07:15.334
THE LATE EIGHTIES BUT I'M REALLY

00:07:15.401 --> 00:07:17.670
REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT ALSO.

00:07:17.737 --> 00:07:19.138
WE HAVE MANY -- DWELLINGS AND

00:07:19.205 --> 00:07:20.740
SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY THAT ARE

00:07:20.807 --> 00:07:22.375
BUILT ON CALL THE FAX.

00:07:22.441 --> 00:07:23.609
IN THOSE HAVE VERY FEW -- CURB

00:07:23.676 --> 00:07:32.318
pREASON SO THAT PEOPLE DON'T PARK

00:07:32.385 --> 00:07:33.886
ON THE STREET.

00:07:33.953 --> 00:07:35.755
OUR BECAUSE YOU CANNOT GET OUT

00:07:35.822 --> 00:07:37.190
OF THOSE TRUCKS DOWN AND OUT THE

00:07:37.256 --> 00:07:38.324
FIRE THIRTY ACTUALLY DID WEIGH

00:07:38.391 --> 00:07:40.126
IN ON SOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT

00:07:40.193 --> 00:07:42.128
FROM NOW I'LL EARLY AND MIDDLE

00:07:42.195 --> 00:07:42.528
NINETIES.

00:07:42.595 --> 00:07:45.164
NOT APPROVING BECAUSE INDUSTRIES

00:07:45.231 --> 00:07:45.565
WERE TOO NARROW.

00:07:45.631 --> 00:07:47.200
THAT THOSE COME AFTER THE FACT

00:07:47.266 --> 00:07:47.934
IN WHEN YOU'RE JUST DOING AND

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.568
EIGHTY YOU.

00:07:48.634 --> 00:07:49.602
KNOW THAT CAN EASILY BE MALE SO

00:07:49.669 --> 00:07:52.772
THAT SOMETHING I THINK NEEDS A

00:07:52.839 --> 00:07:54.774
REALLY CLOSER LOOK AT SO WITHOUT

00:07:54.841 --> 00:07:56.142
I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY BECAUSE

00:07:56.209 --> 00:07:57.210
I THINK AB USE ARE REALLY.

00:07:57.276 --> 00:07:58.845
A GOOD PATH TO OUR HOUSING

00:07:58.911 --> 00:08:00.213
AFFORDABILITY ISSUE.

00:08:00.279 --> 00:08:01.647
THAT WE CANNOT I THINK DENY WITH

00:08:01.714 --> 00:08:03.082
ALWAYS BEEN PART OF GOOD

00:08:03.149 --> 00:08:03.983
PLANNING AND IT WAS THEIR

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:05.585
SPECIFICALLY -- TO ENSURE THAT

00:08:05.651 --> 00:08:06.719
WE HAD PUBLIC THE SAFETY AND

00:08:06.786 --> 00:08:08.621
HEALTH ISSUES OF COMMUNITIES ARE

00:08:08.688 --> 00:08:11.090
ADDRESS THROUGH GOOD URBAN

00:08:11.157 --> 00:08:12.992
PLANNING.

00:08:13.059 --> 00:08:13.659
AND I THINK YOU'RE YOU'RE YOU'RE

00:08:13.726 --> 00:08:15.127
POINTERS THAT ARE VERY VERY WELL

00:08:15.194 --> 00:08:16.462
TAKEN -- I WOULD JUST GIVE ONE

00:08:16.529 --> 00:08:17.597
EXAMPLE SOME OF WHAT WE'RE

00:08:17.663 --> 00:08:19.098
TRYING TO FIGHT AGAINST HIS WE

00:08:19.165 --> 00:08:20.299
HAVE THE CITY OF PEOPLE ON WHICH

00:08:20.366 --> 00:08:22.034
IS AND AND YOU KNOW VERY CLOSE

00:08:22.101 --> 00:08:23.169
TO MY CITY -- THEY HAVE A

00:08:23.236 --> 00:08:26.072
REQUIREMENT OF A MINIMUM EIGHT

00:08:26.138 --> 00:08:28.007
THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT LOT TO

00:08:28.074 --> 00:08:29.342
BUILD AN EIGHTY YEAR AND THAT

00:08:29.408 --> 00:08:32.478
SEEMS A LITTLE BIT -- BEYOND TO

00:08:32.545 --> 00:08:33.880
FIRE SAFETY ISSUES I THINK I

00:08:33.946 --> 00:08:34.881
THINK YOUR ISSUES AROUND FIRE

00:08:34.947 --> 00:08:37.250
SAFETY ARE VERY IMPORTANT AND

00:08:37.316 --> 00:08:38.251
YOU KNOW WE'LL WE'LL TAKE A

00:08:38.317 --> 00:08:42.154
CLOSER LOOK AT THAT BUT I THINK.

00:08:42.221 --> 00:08:42.722
THIS IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO

00:08:42.788 --> 00:08:45.691
FIGHT AGAINST.

00:08:45.758 --> 00:08:46.959
OKAY THIS IS ABOUT QUESTIONS YES

00:08:47.026 --> 00:08:48.294
SENATE ON THE SCHOOL REAL QUICK

00:08:48.361 --> 00:08:49.495
SO ON THE EIGHT THOUSAND AS

00:08:49.562 --> 00:08:50.129
QUITE A FEW IT DEPENDS ON WHAT

00:08:50.196 --> 00:08:52.565
IS ALREADY THE EXISTING THERE.

00:08:52.632 --> 00:08:56.202
SO IF YOU HAVE A YOU KNOW THE

00:08:56.269 --> 00:08:56.802
SIX THOUSAND SQUARE FOOT HOME

00:08:56.869 --> 00:08:58.504
YOU'RE IT SO THAT THOSE ARE NEED

00:08:58.571 --> 00:09:00.539
TO BE SOMEWHERE IN THE I MEAN IT.

00:09:00.606 --> 00:09:01.540
WAS.

00:09:01.607 --> 00:09:03.442
THAT CHAT WAS STOP FOR SECOND I

00:09:03.509 --> 00:09:03.976
MEAN THERE HAS TO BE SOME

00:09:04.043 --> 00:09:04.810
ABILITIES DO AS WE COMMONSENSE

00:09:04.877 --> 00:09:06.913
ME HAS TO HAS TO WORK.

00:09:06.979 --> 00:09:09.949
FOR THE DIVISIONAL SQUARE FOOT

00:09:10.016 --> 00:09:10.549
EASIER PUTTING IN THERE SO I'M

00:09:10.616 --> 00:09:11.951
ASSUMING THAT -- THAT WILL BE

00:09:12.018 --> 00:09:13.019
AVAILABLE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL TO

00:09:13.085 --> 00:09:14.220
SAY HEY FOR THE FIRE IF THERE'S

00:09:14.287 --> 00:09:16.489
NOT ACCESS EGRESS.

00:09:16.555 --> 00:09:16.989
THOSE ISSUES NEED TO BE

00:09:17.056 --> 00:09:19.158
ADDRESSED WE'RE TRYING TO WE'RE

00:09:19.225 --> 00:09:21.294
TRYING TO DO THIS IN A WAY THAT.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:23.663
WHAT WILL COMPLEMENT A COMMUNITY

00:09:23.729 --> 00:09:24.997
AND NOT HINDER IT?

00:09:25.064 --> 00:09:26.132
AND COMING OUT OF LOCAL

00:09:26.198 --> 00:09:27.533
GOVERNMENT UNDERSTANDING AND

00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:29.635
APPROVING MANY DIFFERENT DOES

00:09:29.702 --> 00:09:32.138
SUBDIVISIONS -- AND WE WE GOT

00:09:32.204 --> 00:09:33.239
WITH THE THE GRANNY FLATS AS

00:09:33.306 --> 00:09:34.907
WELL IN THERE GOOD TOOL THEY'RE

00:09:34.974 --> 00:09:35.408
ACTUALLY HELPFUL FOR THE

00:09:35.474 --> 00:09:36.876
COMMUNITY -- WHERE THEY MAKE

00:09:36.943 --> 00:09:38.444
SENSE BUT SOME PLACES THE LOT

00:09:38.511 --> 00:09:39.745
SIZES DON'T MAKE THAT THEY JUST

00:09:39.812 --> 00:09:41.347
DON'T MAKE SENSE AS WE WANT TO

00:09:41.414 --> 00:09:42.014
MAKE SURE THAT WE GIVE THE

00:09:42.081 --> 00:09:44.116
ABILITY? FOR THE LOCALS TO BE ON

00:09:44.183 --> 00:09:45.051
THE WAY IN.

00:09:45.117 --> 00:09:46.819
WHERE THEY WERE DOESN'T MAKE

00:09:46.886 --> 00:09:48.821
SENSE AND WHERE DOES MAKE SENSE

00:09:48.888 --> 00:09:51.023
ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE -- TO YOU

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.524
KNOW IF.

00:09:51.590 --> 00:09:53.392
PUT IN THOSE SAID ADDITIONAL

00:09:53.459 --> 00:09:55.695
UNITS.

00:09:55.761 --> 00:09:58.130
AT LUIS PARTE AYE AYE I JUST

00:09:58.197 --> 00:10:00.433
ECHO THE THE THE COMMENT THAT

00:10:00.499 --> 00:10:01.000
WHILE WE TAKE THOSE CONCERNS

00:10:01.067 --> 00:10:01.901
SERIOUSLY -- THE BILL WOULD NOT

00:10:01.968 --> 00:10:02.969
AFFECT CALIFORNIA'S BUILDING

00:10:03.035 --> 00:10:04.470
STANDARDS CODE WHICH CONTAINS

00:10:04.537 --> 00:10:07.173
THE FIRE CODE WHICH DESCRIBES --

00:10:07.239 --> 00:10:08.708
BOTH BUILDING MATERIALS THAT

00:10:08.774 --> 00:10:09.608
SHOULD BE USED PREVENT FIRE BUT

00:10:09.675 --> 00:10:11.010
ALSO SET STANDARDS FOR INGRESS

00:10:11.077 --> 00:10:11.978
AND EGRESS.

00:10:12.044 --> 00:10:14.447
THOSE ISSUES WOULD NOT BE

00:10:14.513 --> 00:10:16.682
AFFECTED BY AB -- SIXTY EIGHT

00:10:16.749 --> 00:10:17.984
SIMILARLY -- STATE EIGHTY YOU

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.019
LAW HAS A PROVISIONS THAT ALLOW

00:10:20.086 --> 00:10:21.754
A LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE AS

00:10:21.821 --> 00:10:24.890
A PART OF THE SAID THAT THE

00:10:24.957 --> 00:10:26.325
SETBACK THAT THEY WOULD.

00:10:26.392 --> 00:10:27.693
BE BE ALLOWED TO IMPOSE THEY IT

00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:30.096
ALLOWS THEM TO CONSIDER FIRE

00:10:30.162 --> 00:10:32.865
SAFETY AS A PART OF THAT -- SO I

00:10:32.932 --> 00:10:37.169
WOULD DEFINITELY ECHO THAT WE

00:10:37.236 --> 00:10:38.671
TAKE THOSE CONCERNS OR SAY

00:10:38.738 --> 00:10:38.971
[inaudible]

00:10:48.214 --> 00:10:49.248
SQUARE FOOT HOUSE.

00:10:49.315 --> 00:10:51.584
THAT WAS BUILT IN NINETEEN FORTY

00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:52.551
SEVEN AND THE CITY WANTS TO SAY

00:10:52.618 --> 00:10:54.754

BE A CHALLENGE.

00:11:06.866 --> 00:11:08.167
BY THE WAY THIS THIS BILL WILL

00:11:08.234 --> 00:11:10.136
BE GOING TO GOVERN TO FINANCE IT

00:11:10.202 --> 00:11:12.838
PASSES OUT COMMITTEE TODAY SO

00:11:12.905 --> 00:11:13.472
THEY'LL BE LOOKING ON THE LOCAL

00:11:13.539 --> 00:11:15.775
GOVERNMENT.

00:11:15.841 --> 00:11:18.144
LAKE IT'S EXPECTED SINISTER.

00:11:18.210 --> 00:11:19.245
SMILE I WILL I WAS SITTING IN MY

00:11:19.311 --> 00:11:21.380
OFFICE WORKING ON SOMETHING ON

00:11:21.447 --> 00:11:22.148
RELATED TO THIS BILL IS WATCHING

00:11:22.214 --> 00:11:23.149
ON TV SO I APOLOGIZE FOR MISSING

00:11:23.215 --> 00:11:23.749
THE PRESENTATION IS ACTUALLY

00:11:23.816 --> 00:11:26.385
COMPELLED BY -- WHAT I HEARD

00:11:26.452 --> 00:11:28.754
FROM SOME MY COLLEAGUES IN SOME

00:11:28.821 --> 00:11:29.422
OF THE CONCERNS IN THE LEAGUE I

00:11:29.488 --> 00:11:30.189
JUST?

00:11:30.256 --> 00:11:32.058
I WASN'T PLANNING TO HOLD OFF ON

00:11:32.124 --> 00:11:34.393
THE BILL TODAY I I JUST NEED TO

00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:37.363
DO WAY IN BECAUSE WHAT I HEARD

00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:39.031
LET'S GET SPECIFIC HERE ON FIRE

00:11:39.098 --> 00:11:41.067
CODE ISSUE COMING DRILL DOWN ON

00:11:41.133 --> 00:11:41.801
THAT IT JUST.

00:11:41.867 --> 00:11:43.202
GETS SO ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT

00:11:43.269 --> 00:11:44.303
BUILDING INSPECTION ARE YOU

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:45.104
ACTUALLY TALKING ABOUT

00:11:45.171 --> 00:11:46.472
TRANSPORTATION AND LAND USE

00:11:46.539 --> 00:11:47.907
PLANNING [inaudible]

00:11:47.973 --> 00:11:50.576
THERE IS.

00:11:50.643 --> 00:11:51.444
THERE'S TWO PIECES AND LUIS FEEL

00:11:51.510 --> 00:11:52.678
FREE TO JUMP IN BUT I THINK

00:11:52.745 --> 00:11:54.680
THERE'S THE BUILDING CODES THAT

00:11:54.747 --> 00:11:56.482
GET INTO HOW YOU BUILD.

00:11:56.549 --> 00:11:59.351
THE EIGHTY YOU -- TO INSURE THAT

00:11:59.418 --> 00:12:01.420
IT'S SAFE AND AS YOU KNOW SAFE

00:12:01.487 --> 00:12:02.955
IN CASE OF FIRE AND THEN THERE'S

00:12:03.022 --> 00:12:05.291
THE INDIVIDUAL PERMITS WHERE AND

00:12:05.357 --> 00:12:06.759
THE BUILDING PERMIT.

00:12:06.826 --> 00:12:09.161
IS DEPENDENT ON IN THIS CASE IF

00:12:09.228 --> 00:12:10.930
YOU MEET THE REQUIREMENTS BUT

00:12:10.996 --> 00:12:13.165
THE PENDING THE APPROVAL OF THE

00:12:13.232 --> 00:12:15.101
FIRE AUTHORITIES.

00:12:15.167 --> 00:12:17.770
THAT IS KIND OF TO ENSURE THE

00:12:17.837 --> 00:12:19.371
THE BILL COVERS BOTH.

00:12:19.438 --> 00:12:20.039
SO THE BILL DOESN'T HATCH EITHER

00:12:20.106 --> 00:12:22.475
OF THOSE THAT'S JUST EXISTING ON

00:12:22.541 --> 00:12:23.876
AND SO -- WHOM WHO DECIDES IN

00:12:23.943 --> 00:12:24.443
THE TRANSPORTATION LAND USE

00:12:24.510 --> 00:12:26.011
ELEMENT YOU'RE SAYING THIS THAT

00:12:26.078 --> 00:12:27.746
THAT WOULD BE PREEMPTED LIKE

00:12:27.813 --> 00:12:29.515
THAT.

00:12:29.582 --> 00:12:30.316
YOU COULD ORROW EIGHTY USE IN

00:12:30.382 --> 00:12:32.852
CERTAIN AREAS THROUGH THE THAT

00:12:32.918 --> 00:12:34.453
THIS SPECIFIC PLAN OR THE

00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:36.322
GENERAL PLAN IN THE AREA.

00:12:36.388 --> 00:12:37.857
THAT YOU CONSULT YOU COULD ZONE

00:12:37.923 --> 00:12:41.560
THAT OR NO GOT TO SELL THE BILL --

00:12:41.627 --> 00:12:44.530
REQUIRES THAT WHERE HOUSING

00:12:44.597 --> 00:12:46.332
RESIDENTIAL ZONING IS REQUIRED

00:12:46.398 --> 00:12:47.666
THAT YOU CAN'T BAR EIGHTIES FROM

00:12:47.733 --> 00:12:49.235
BEING BUILT IN THAT SPACE.

00:12:49.301 --> 00:12:50.536
BUT IT DOESN'T REQUIRE THE

00:12:50.603 --> 00:12:52.605
EIGHTIES BE BUILT IN IS DOWN IN

00:12:52.671 --> 00:12:55.574
AN AREA THAT'S NOT ON FOR

00:12:55.641 --> 00:12:57.343
RESIDENTIAL USE.

00:12:57.409 --> 00:12:58.711
SO IF A LOCAL GOVERNMENT HAS

LOCAL GOVERNMENT COULD IMPOSE

OTHER SETBACKS COULD BE WAIVED

00:16:09.168 --> 00:16:11.003
BY THE MINISTER PROVISIONS OF

00:16:11.070 --> 00:16:15.908
THE AB [inaudible]

00:16:15.974 --> 00:16:17.743
SIXTY THE SERVER.

00:16:17.810 --> 00:16:18.911

DIGESTIVE SAYING ABOUT THE THE

BILL ITSELF AND I THINK WHAT WE

00:16:22.781 --> 00:16:24.416
HAVE HERE SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

00:16:24.483 --> 00:16:26.085

00:16:26.151 --> 00:16:27.453
PROBABLY IS WHERE YOU NEED.

00:16:27.519 --> 00:16:28.787
TO KIND OF FOCUS IN GOING

00:16:28.854 --> 00:16:31.423
FORWARD IT SPECIFICALLY SAYS

00:16:31.490 --> 00:16:33.559
THIS DIGEST THIS IS ON OUR ITEM

REQUIRE MINIMUM LOT SIZE OR

00:16:40.733 --> 00:16:42.768
CERTAIN SET BACKS AND I THINK --

00:16:42.835 --> 00:16:44.269
GOES ON ABOUT THE PARKING WHICH

00:16:44.336 --> 00:16:46.138
IS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I THINK

00:16:46.205 --> 00:16:46.939
THE FACT BACK ISSUES IS.

00:16:47.005 --> 00:16:50.376
SIGNIFICANTLY HUGE IN TERMS OF

00:16:50.442 --> 00:16:52.311
WHO'S GONNA SAY -- THAT YOU CAN

POINT.

00:28:42.787 --> 00:28:44.189
BEFORE YOU GO LET'S WHAT

00:28:44.255 --> 00:28:46.357
DISTURBS ME PEOPLE HERE WHEN WE

00:28:46.424 --> 00:28:46.991
ASK ABOUT THIS BECAUSE THAT WAS

00:28:47.058 --> 00:28:48.893
SOMETHING THAT I I HEARD RAISED

00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:50.528
EARLIER -- WE'LL TRY AND COURAGE

00:28:50.595 --> 00:28:53.064
PEOPLE YOU KNOW -- TO TO NOT USE

00:28:53.131 --> 00:28:55.366
THE BAGS -- THAT'S A WASTE

00:28:55.433 --> 00:28:56.801
REDUCTION ISSUES BECAUSE WELL SO

00:28:56.868 --> 00:28:58.336
PEOPLE ARE COMING WITH THEIR OWN

00:28:58.403 --> 00:28:59.571
BAG THEIR OWN SHOPPING CARDS.

00:28:59.637 --> 00:29:00.705
ARE THAT'S ALL GOOD BUT IT MAKES

00:29:00.772 --> 00:29:01.306
IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT I WOULD

00:29:01.372 --> 00:29:02.440
THINK TO VERIFY THAT SOMEONE

00:29:02.507 --> 00:29:04.175
ACTUALLY PURCHASED THE ITEMS

00:29:04.242 --> 00:29:05.076
THAT THEY'RE WALKING OUT OF THE

00:29:05.143 --> 00:29:07.011
STORE WITH -- OBVIOUSLY THIRD

00:29:07.078 --> 00:29:08.279
THERE WITH THAT STORE PROVIDING

00:29:08.346 --> 00:29:09.380
BAGS IT PROVIDES A LITTLE MORE

00:29:09.447 --> 00:29:10.715
OF AN INDICATION SO.

00:29:10.782 --> 00:29:13.618
HOW DOES HOW DOES A STORE --

00:29:13.685 --> 00:29:15.954
DEAL WITH THIS QUESTION -- IF

00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:18.022
THEY'RE USING THEIR OWN BAGS AND

00:29:18.089 --> 00:29:21.493
AND THERE'S NO RECIBE PROVIDED I

00:29:21.559 --> 00:29:22.727
THINK IT'S A GREAT QUESTION MISS

00:29:22.794 --> 00:29:24.729
MARINO HAS ASSOCIATIONS BEEN

00:29:24.796 --> 00:29:25.763
BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH WE HAVE

00:29:25.830 --> 00:29:27.465
A DIALOGUE -- IF YOU THINK ABOUT

00:29:27.532 --> 00:29:28.967
IT -- IT'S GREAT ARGUMENT

00:29:29.033 --> 00:29:31.469
HOWEVER MOST STORES DON'T CHECK

00:29:31.536 --> 00:29:44.382
RECEIPTS UPON LEAVING THE STORE.

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:46.317
SO FROM MOSCOW DEFINITELY DOES

00:29:46.384 --> 00:29:48.119
COSCO DOES BUT MOST GROCERS

00:29:48.186 --> 00:29:49.087

TIME THEY CHECKED OR THERE ARE

00:29:56.161 --> 00:29:58.329
CERTAIN RETAILERS COSCO BEST BUY.

00:29:58.396 --> 00:29:59.597
I BELIEVE SAM'S CLUB WALMART

00:29:59.664 --> 00:30:01.299
THEY THEY DEFINITELY DO THAT.

00:30:01.366 --> 00:30:02.534
MOST RETAILERS DO NOT RITE AID

00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:04.169
WALGREENS WE CAN GO DOWN THE

00:30:04.235 --> 00:30:05.336

TO REMEMBER THE LAST TIME

00:30:11.209 --> 00:30:12.911
OUTSIDE OF THOSE THOSE FEW

00:30:12.977 --> 00:30:13.545

A SWEET SPOT AND WE HOPE WE CAN --

00:30:23.254 --> 00:30:25.223

PARTICULAR THERE'S HIGHER

00:31:01.359 --> 00:31:02.160
INSTEAD OF SHOPLIFTING AFTER

00:31:26.818 --> 00:31:28.353
COMMENTS MADE BY A ONE OF THE

00:31:28.419 --> 00:31:29.320
PROPONENTS WAS THAT YOU KNOW

00:31:29.387 --> 00:31:30.655

ASK FOR FOUR FOOT -- RECEIPT AND

00:31:34.859 --> 00:31:37.195
THAT'S TRUE.

00:31:37.262 --> 00:31:38.429
THAT'S HELLO MY AGE BUT MAYBE

00:31:38.496 --> 00:31:40.431
THERE'S A WAY.

00:31:40.498 --> 00:31:42.033
TO ALLOW STORES TO PROVIDE

00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:43.167
SOMETHING MUCH MORE --

00:31:43.234 --> 00:31:44.969
DISTINCTION SMALL.

00:31:45.036 --> 00:31:45.536
THAT WOULD HAVE THE KIND OF

00:31:45.603 --> 00:31:47.272
WASTE -- ISSUES ASSOCIATE WITH A

00:31:47.338 --> 00:31:48.206

CARRYING AROUND RIGHT THE THINGS

00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:43.761

RELATIVELY BRIEF --

00:38:16.694 --> 00:38:17.962
FUNDAMENTALLY OPPOSED THE BILL

00:38:18.029 --> 00:38:19.897
SPECIFICALLY.

00:38:19.964 --> 00:38:23.434
THE SKIP THE SLIP CONCEPT WE

CONTEXTS SUCH AS COFFEE OR OTHER

00:38:44.055 --> 00:38:46.924
PRACTICAL -- TO HANDLE RETURNS

00:39:09.346 --> 00:39:10.748

00:39:13.551 --> 00:39:14.418

THERE'S ALSO.

00:49:33.570 --> 00:49:35.238
AN AREA WHERE WE NEED TO FOCUS

00:49:35.305 --> 00:49:39.209

HASN'T STUDY THAT.

00:50:28.859 --> 00:50:30.994

00:50:38.268 --> 00:50:38.835
I'M SOMEBODY WHO'S IN BUSINESS

00:50:38.902 --> 00:50:40.971

WE NEED EXPERTS TO TELL US

00:51:11.701 --> 00:51:13.236

THEY'RE DOING SOMETHING SO I

00:51:22.679 --> 00:51:24.247
IT'S NOT DIRECTED TOWARDS THE

SO. FOR THAT REASON AND MANY

00:51:33.857 --> 00:51:35.192
OTHER REASONS THAT THIS IS GOING

00:51:35.258 --> 00:51:36.660
TO DRIVE UP THE COST OF DOING

00:51:36.726 --> 00:51:38.295
BUSINESS AND I ALSO KNOW THAT

00:51:38.361 --> 00:51:39.396
20% OF THOSE.

00:51:39.463 --> 00:51:40.831
PEOPLE WHO ARE WALKING OUT THE

00:51:40.897 --> 00:51:42.666
DOOR WITH LESS THAN NINE HUNDRED

00:51:42.732 --> 00:51:43.333
FIFTY DOLLARS WORTH OF

00:51:43.400 --> 00:51:45.135
MERCHANDISE. TO A BUSINESS

00:51:45.202 --> 00:51:46.470
THERE'S A WE HAVE LAWS THAT

00:51:46.536 --> 00:51:47.904
ALLOW YOU JUST.

00:51:47.971 --> 00:51:49.706
BASICALLY STEAL UP TO NINE

00:51:49.773 --> 00:51:50.173
HUNDRED DOLLARS AND A

00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.908
MISDEMEANOR -- THAT IMPACTS

00:51:51.975 --> 00:51:54.444
BUSINESS AS WELL SO I THINK WE

00:51:54.511 --> 00:51:56.246
NEED TO SLOW DOWN.

00:51:56.313 --> 00:51:57.714
MAYBE GET SOME MORE.

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.716
SCIENTIFIC DATA ON A LOT OF

00:51:59.783 --> 00:52:00.717
ISSUES THAT COME TO THESE

00:52:00.784 --> 00:52:03.653
COMMITTEES AND AND GIVE IT BACK

00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:05.088
THAT'S WHY WE TO BE.

00:52:05.155 --> 00:52:06.690
PUT IT IN THE HANDS OF DTS C. SO

00:52:06.756 --> 00:52:07.357
THAT WE CAN ACTUALLY.

00:52:07.424 --> 00:52:08.725
NOT HAVE TO SIT THROUGH FOUR

00:52:08.792 --> 00:52:10.760
HOURS OF COMMITTEE HEARINGS

00:52:10.827 --> 00:52:12.829
WHERE WE HAVE SCIENTISTS

00:52:12.896 --> 00:52:14.197
DEBATING BACK AND FORTH WHAT'S.

00:52:14.264 --> 00:52:15.432
ON A PIECE OF PAPER WHAT THE

00:52:15.499 --> 00:52:16.633
CHEMICAL ACTUAL DOES AND I

00:52:16.700 --> 00:52:18.735
ACTUALLY WANT TO KNOW IF IT'S

00:52:18.802 --> 00:52:19.936
HARMFUL NUMBER.

00:52:20.003 --> 00:52:21.371
ONE AND NOT JUST DRIVEN BY

00:52:21.438 --> 00:52:22.973
WHATEVER CLUB OF THE DAY IS

00:52:23.039 --> 00:52:24.074
TRYING TO POSE ITSELF.

00:52:24.140 --> 00:52:26.109
SO I'M JUST MAKING A STATEMENT I

00:52:26.176 --> 00:52:27.711
THINK WE NEED TO SLOW DOWN WE'RE

00:52:27.777 --> 00:52:29.713
SEEING A LOT OF ONE OFFS TYPES

00:52:29.779 --> 00:52:30.614
PIECE OF LEGISLATION COME

00:52:30.680 --> 00:52:31.781
THROUGH ARE WE GOING.

00:52:31.848 --> 00:52:33.250
TO TAKE THAT ROLE THAT'S THE

00:52:33.316 --> 00:52:34.818
ROLE WE WANT TO TAKE AND I I

00:52:34.885 --> 00:52:35.752
WOULD LIKE TO HAVE SCIENTISTS

00:52:35.819 --> 00:52:36.653
COMING YEAR TELLS.

00:52:36.720 --> 00:52:38.154
FACTUALLY WHAT THEY'VE STUDIED

00:52:38.221 --> 00:52:40.257
IN WHAT THE PRODUCTS ACTUALLY

00:52:40.323 --> 00:52:42.325
DUE TO PEOPLE SO. FOR THAT

00:52:42.392 --> 00:52:43.159
REASON I'M GONNA BE OPPOSE IN

00:52:43.226 --> 00:52:46.062
THE BILL.

00:52:46.129 --> 00:52:47.964
AND I THINK WE NEED TO YOU KNOW.

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:49.065
MORE COMMONSENSE APPROACH AND

00:52:49.132 --> 00:52:50.967
NOT DO THESE ONE OFFS AND AND I

00:52:51.034 --> 00:52:52.569
THINK IT WILL BE BETTER SO WE

00:52:52.636 --> 00:52:53.203
CAN ACTUALLY GO OUT TARGETS THAT

00:52:53.270 --> 00:52:54.037
YOU SAY THIS IS WHAT'S ACTUALLY

00:52:54.104 --> 00:52:55.238
HAPPENING TO YOU IF YOU HANDLE

00:52:55.305 --> 00:52:56.806
THIS PRODUCT.

00:52:56.873 --> 00:52:58.441
NOW I KNOW THAT MY BUSINESS THAT

00:52:58.508 --> 00:52:59.676
I HAVE A WHOLE LIST OF THINGS

00:52:59.743 --> 00:53:02.078
THAT CAUSE CANCER.

00:53:02.145 --> 00:53:02.913
THE STATE CALPERS AS A COST

00:53:02.979 --> 00:53:04.748
CANCERS PROP SIXTY FIVE WHICH IS

00:53:04.814 --> 00:53:06.716
BEEN STUDY HAS BEEN POSTED THERE.

00:53:06.783 --> 00:53:09.152
SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND JUST

00:53:09.219 --> 00:53:10.854
FOR THAT STATEMENT I'D LIKE.

00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:12.055
TO WAY AND I'VE I HOPE THEY

00:53:12.122 --> 00:53:13.023
NEVER KICK ME OFF THIS COMMITTEE

00:53:13.089 --> 00:53:14.291
BECAUSE I ACTUALLY LOVE THIS

00:53:14.357 --> 00:53:15.892
KIND OF STUFF AND IT'S WHAT WE

00:53:15.959 --> 00:53:16.993
SHOULD DO GOOD WORK IF SOMEBODY

00:53:17.060 --> 00:53:18.395
IS IF WE DON'T KNOW THE

00:53:18.461 --> 00:53:19.829
INFORMATION WE SHOULD GET THAT

00:53:19.896 --> 00:53:21.464
INFORMATION SO. FOR THOSE

00:53:21.531 --> 00:53:22.465
REASONS I WILL BE OPPOSE IN THIS

00:53:22.532 --> 00:53:23.500
PIECE LEDGES AND MANY OTHERS

00:53:23.567 --> 00:53:26.303
THAT COME TROUGH HERE.

00:53:26.369 --> 00:53:28.772
THAT ARE DRIVEN NOT OFF OF GOOD

00:53:28.838 --> 00:53:30.273
SCIENCE DATA.

00:53:30.340 --> 00:53:32.342
THANK YOU FOR THE FOLLOW UP ON

00:53:32.409 --> 00:53:35.345
YOUR ON YOUR COMMENT -- I THERE

00:53:35.412 --> 00:53:36.880
IS AN INTERESTING DISTINCTION WE

00:53:36.947 --> 00:53:38.615
WE KEEP MISSING BE PLEASANT BPA

00:53:38.682 --> 00:53:39.516
IN THE SAME BREATH.

00:53:39.583 --> 00:53:41.451
BPA IS A PROP SIXTY FIVE LISTED

00:53:41.518 --> 00:53:44.754
CHEMICAL BBSS NOT -- CAN YOU

00:53:44.821 --> 00:53:46.756
SPEAK A LITTLE BIT TOO YEAH WE

00:53:46.823 --> 00:53:48.425
ACTUALLY HAVE THE ENVIRONMENTAL

00:53:48.491 --> 00:53:49.926
WORKING GROUP THEY CAN SPEAK TO

00:53:49.993 --> 00:53:50.694
OKAY YES.

00:53:50.760 --> 00:53:52.596
AND WHILE HE'S COMES UP AND IN

00:53:52.662 --> 00:53:53.797
JUST OF MY COLLEAGUE WE START ON

00:53:53.863 --> 00:53:54.965
U. S. CAME TOGETHER IN THE

00:53:55.031 --> 00:53:57.634
ASSEMBLY -- IF YOU JUST FOCUS ON

00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.135
THE WASTE PIECE OF IT.

00:53:59.202 --> 00:54:00.070
THIS IS JUST THE SAME TO

00:54:00.136 --> 00:54:01.805
CONSUMER IF.

00:54:01.871 --> 00:54:03.106
I DON'T WANT THAT PIECE OF PAPER

00:54:03.173 --> 00:54:04.307
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE TO GIVE IT TO

00:54:04.374 --> 00:54:05.008
ME I'VE BEEN IN SO MANY

00:54:05.075 --> 00:54:06.743
RETAILERS SITUATIONS WHERE.

00:54:06.810 --> 00:54:08.511
I DON'T WANT THAT RECEIPT THE

00:54:08.578 --> 00:54:09.913
PRINTED OUT IN THE THROAT IN THE

00:54:09.980 --> 00:54:11.314
IN THE TRASH SO I GUESS THEY'RE

00:54:11.381 --> 00:54:12.382
MORE EFFICIENT ABOUT FOR WORKING

00:54:12.449 --> 00:54:13.083
IN THE TRASH.

00:54:13.149 --> 00:54:14.084
BUT THEY JUST DID SOMETHING THAT

00:54:14.150 --> 00:54:16.620
I DIDN'T NEED WE DON'T NEED AND

00:54:16.686 --> 00:54:17.687
THEN IT GOES INTO OUR WASTE

00:54:17.754 --> 00:54:18.688
REMAINS IS UNNECESSARY SO I

00:54:18.755 --> 00:54:20.824
THINK IF YOU JUST LOOK AT JUST

00:54:20.890 --> 00:54:22.392
THAT PIECE OF IT.

00:54:22.459 --> 00:54:23.994
EMPOWERING THE CONSUMERS TO NOT

00:54:24.060 --> 00:54:25.095
BE FORCED TO TAKE A PIECE OF

00:54:25.161 --> 00:54:26.730
PAPER THAT'S TOXIC BUT THEY

00:54:26.796 --> 00:54:27.330
DON'T WANT.

00:54:27.397 --> 00:54:29.933
THAT THAT'S THE CRUX OF THIS. TO

00:54:30.000 --> 00:54:30.834
ALLOW YOUR ENVIRONMENT WORKING

00:54:30.900 --> 00:54:33.370
GROUP ON THE DPA VERSES BE PS

00:54:33.436 --> 00:54:35.238
DISTINCTION YES BPA IS THE ONLY

00:54:35.305 --> 00:54:36.506
ONE ON THE PROP SIXTY FIVE

00:54:36.573 --> 00:54:38.441
LISTED SO REPRODUCTIVE TOXICANT

00:54:38.508 --> 00:54:40.043
IT'S AN AND CAN DISRUPTOR.

00:54:40.110 --> 00:54:42.178
IT IS HAS ESTROGENIC EFFECTS

00:54:42.245 --> 00:54:44.381
THAT MIMIC THAT CHEMICAL IN YOUR

00:54:44.447 --> 00:54:45.915
ABOUT HORMONE IN YOUR BODY

00:54:45.982 --> 00:54:47.717
WHETHER YOU'RE MALE OR FEMALE.

00:54:47.784 --> 00:54:49.285
BAD NEWS BE PS IS TURNING INTO

00:54:49.352 --> 00:54:51.154
WHAT'S KNOWN AS THE CLASSIC

00:54:51.221 --> 00:54:52.389
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION.

00:54:52.455 --> 00:54:53.957
I JUST PULLED UP HERE IN THE

00:54:54.024 --> 00:54:55.659
AUDIENCE -- TWENTY FOURTEEN

00:54:55.725 --> 00:54:57.227
REPORT FROM A IN SCIENTIFIC

00:54:57.293 --> 00:55:00.063
AMERICAN SAYING IS BE PSA FOR

00:55:00.130 --> 00:55:01.431
AND THEY'RE SAYING ALL THE EARLY

00:55:01.498 --> 00:55:03.400
DAD IS IT'S NOT.

00:55:03.466 --> 00:55:04.968
AND THAT'S BECAUSE IT HAS MORE

00:55:05.035 --> 00:55:06.670
MOAN LIKE ESTROGENIC EFFECTS IN

00:55:06.736 --> 00:55:08.705
THE BODY AND THEY THINK ONE DAY

00:55:08.772 --> 00:55:10.006
IT'LL BE PHÃN JUST THE SAME I

00:55:10.073 --> 00:55:12.208
CAMERA WHICH WAY IT GOES NOW.

00:55:12.275 --> 00:55:14.477
ONE IS EXTRA EXCRETED MORE

00:55:14.544 --> 00:55:16.346
RAPIDLY FROM THE BODY PPA VERSES

00:55:16.413 --> 00:55:18.515
BE PS THE OTHER RESTAURANT

00:55:18.581 --> 00:55:19.382
ARRESTOR JENNINGS TAX BUT

00:55:19.449 --> 00:55:20.784
THEY'RE KIND OF APPLES AND

00:55:20.850 --> 00:55:22.886
ORANGES BUT THE SAME THING IN

00:55:22.952 --> 00:55:23.987
YOUR BODY.

00:55:24.054 --> 00:55:25.689
AM I ALSO PUT POINT OUT THAT --

00:55:25.755 --> 00:55:28.491
BPA CONTRARY THE SCREWS ME THE

00:55:28.558 --> 00:55:30.727
WITNESS EARLIER HAS BEEN PROVEN

00:55:30.794 --> 00:55:31.728
TO BE BAD FOR YOUR BODY PPS IS

00:55:31.795 --> 00:55:34.297
ON ITS WAY THE PROBLEM WITH THE

00:55:34.364 --> 00:55:35.732
GREEN CHEMISTRY.

00:55:35.799 --> 00:55:37.067
AT THE TNC IS IT TAKES YEARS AND

00:55:37.133 --> 00:55:38.635
YEARS AND YEARS AND SO THE

00:55:38.702 --> 00:55:40.236
STUDIES ARE UNDERWAY ABOUT THE

00:55:40.303 --> 00:55:42.338
THE S. AND P. P. F. THIS BEING

00:55:42.405 --> 00:55:43.373
ALL FLUORIDE.

00:55:43.440 --> 00:55:44.607
THEY ALL APPEAR TO ACT THE SAME

00:55:44.674 --> 00:55:46.209
IN THE BODY WE THINK IT'S A GOOD

00:55:46.276 --> 00:55:47.277
BILL THAT THE STATE OF

00:55:47.343 --> 00:55:49.045
CALIFORNIA SHOULD JUMP AHEAD OF

00:55:49.112 --> 00:55:51.281
THE SLOW SCIENCE AND EVEN SLOWER

00:55:51.347 --> 00:55:52.782
IF OUR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND

00:55:52.849 --> 00:56:00.890
SAY LET'S GET THESE OUT OF

00:56:00.957 --> 00:56:01.291
CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

00:56:01.357 --> 00:56:04.294
THANK YOU.

00:56:04.360 --> 00:56:06.329
OKAY HI MAN OF A CERTAIN.

00:56:06.396 --> 00:56:07.530
A YEAR FROM JUST A COUPLE

00:56:07.597 --> 00:56:08.264
QUESTIONS.

00:56:08.331 --> 00:56:10.366
THAT CAME UP -- REGARDING ALL

00:56:10.433 --> 00:56:14.070
THE IMPACT ON STATE NO.

00:56:14.137 --> 00:56:15.672
AND WHETHER.

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:16.873
WE ARE GOING TO BE EXEMPTED AS

00:56:16.940 --> 00:56:19.609
THE STATE SENS FIVE LOTTERY

00:56:19.676 --> 00:56:20.744
TICKETS WHICH AMEND ARE PRINTED.

00:56:20.810 --> 00:56:22.645
ON HOW DO WE ADDRESS THAT

00:56:22.712 --> 00:56:24.280
ASSEMBLY MEMBER TEAM YOU KNOW

00:56:24.347 --> 00:56:25.482
AGAIN WE WERE SILENT TO IT YEAH

00:56:25.548 --> 00:56:26.316
AGAIN IF THAT'S SOMETHING THAT

00:56:26.382 --> 00:56:27.884
OPPOSITION IS REALLY INTERESTED

00:56:27.951 --> 00:56:30.887
IN -- WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH

00:56:30.954 --> 00:56:33.022
HIM ON THAT ISSUE.

00:56:33.089 --> 00:56:34.424
WELL I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT IF

00:56:34.491 --> 00:56:35.024
YOU HAVE A FOR ABOUT WASTE AND

00:56:35.091 --> 00:56:36.960
IT'S ABOUT TIME PUBLIC HEALTH IN

00:56:37.026 --> 00:56:37.961
TERMS OF THE EMPOWER.

00:56:38.027 --> 00:56:39.028
ALL ABOUT THIS PARTICULAR

00:56:39.095 --> 00:56:40.096
CHEMICAL HOUSE ON YOU KNOW OUR

00:56:40.163 --> 00:56:43.166
BODIES IN THE STATE OUGHT TO BE

00:56:43.233 --> 00:56:43.767
INVOLVED SO MAYBE TAKE OUT FOR

00:56:43.833 --> 00:56:43.933
IT.

00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:45.869
SECONDLY I THINK THAT FOR MYSELF --

00:56:45.935 --> 00:56:47.403
MOST RECENTLY I HAD TO RETURN A

00:56:47.470 --> 00:56:48.238
NUMBER OF THINGS AND I'VE BEEN

00:56:48.304 --> 00:56:48.705
ASKED FOR A RECEIPT.

00:56:48.772 --> 00:56:50.273
IF I DIDN'T ASK FOR THE RECEIPT

00:56:50.340 --> 00:56:51.875
WHEN I BOUGHT THE PRODUCT I

00:56:51.941 --> 00:56:52.642
WOULD HAVE BEEN IN TROUBLE.

00:56:52.709 --> 00:56:53.610
I THINK THAT THAT'S CLEARLY ONE

00:56:53.676 --> 00:56:54.444
OF THE BIG ISSUES HERE AND THE

00:56:54.511 --> 00:56:56.146
IMPACT TO THE BRICK AND MORTAR

00:56:56.212 --> 00:56:56.880
STORES.

00:56:56.946 --> 00:56:57.547
AND I THINK THAT THEY NEED TO BE

00:56:57.614 --> 00:56:58.548
GIVEN SOME TIME WHERE THEY COULD

00:56:58.615 --> 00:57:01.584
ADDRESS HOW THEY WILL BE ABLE TO

00:57:01.651 --> 00:57:03.253
TO ENSURE PROOF OF PURCHASE WHEN

00:57:03.319 --> 00:57:05.255
ITEMS ARE RETURNED I MEAN WHEN

00:57:05.321 --> 00:57:05.889
YOU HEAR.

00:57:05.955 --> 00:57:07.757
THE FINANCIAL IMPACT THAT IS

00:57:07.824 --> 00:57:09.392
MAKING ON THE STORES WE WE'RE

00:57:09.459 --> 00:57:10.794
DRIVING BRICK AND MORTA YOU

00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:12.362
KNOW OUT OF THE STATE OF

00:57:12.428 --> 00:57:14.097
CALIFORNIA I HAPPEN TO BE ONE OF

00:57:14.164 --> 00:57:17.133
THE OLD GUARD THAT LIKES TO GO

00:57:17.200 --> 00:57:17.967
TO THE STORE AND SHOP -- I

00:57:18.034 --> 00:57:20.170
ACTUALLY SEE A LONGER LINES AT

00:57:20.236 --> 00:57:22.372
THE RETURNED OUSTER PEOPLE

00:57:22.438 --> 00:57:24.741
WHO'VE ORDER THINGS ONLINE --

00:57:24.808 --> 00:57:26.342
AND STORES ARE ACCOMMODATING

00:57:26.409 --> 00:57:27.977
ABOUT THAT WE ARE PUTTING AWFUL

00:57:28.044 --> 00:57:29.045
HUGE BURDEN ON THEM IN A SHORT

00:57:29.112 --> 00:57:30.980
PERIOD OF TIME TO CHANGE THE WAY

00:57:31.047 --> 00:57:31.915
THEY DO BUSINESS SO.

00:57:31.981 --> 00:57:32.749
I THINK ON ACCOMMODATION HAS TO

00:57:32.816 --> 00:57:34.417
BE PROVIDED AND I WOULD HOPE

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:35.985
GOING FORWARD YOU'LL CONSIDER

00:57:36.052 --> 00:57:38.688
THAT BECAUSE OF THAT IS.

00:57:38.755 --> 00:57:40.356
THE SALES TAXES GENERATED ALL OF

00:57:40.423 --> 00:57:41.691
THOSE THINGS THAT ARE SO

00:57:41.758 --> 00:57:45.128
IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY. TWO

00:57:45.195 --> 00:57:46.095
JOBS YOU NAY MEANT -- FOR

00:57:46.162 --> 00:57:48.031
GOVERNMENTS AND WHERE THEY GET

00:57:48.097 --> 00:57:51.634
THEIR REVENUES THIS IS A HUGE

00:57:51.701 --> 00:57:54.637
HERE -- ON OUR OUR OWN ECONOMY

00:57:54.704 --> 00:57:56.539
AND CERTAINLY OUR RETAIL ECONOMY.

00:57:56.606 --> 00:57:57.273
PLEASE TAKE THAT INTO

00:57:57.340 --> 00:57:58.174
CONSIDERATION BECAUSE WHEN I

00:57:58.241 --> 00:57:59.909
READ THIS I THOUGHT WOW THAT'S A

00:57:59.976 --> 00:58:02.846
LOT OF TRASH WITHOUT THOSE ARE

00:58:02.912 --> 00:58:04.113
BY DEGRADABLE WE SHRED I'M IN

00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:04.314
THAT.

00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.516
YOU KNOW IF THE IF IT'S HUGE WE

00:58:06.583 --> 00:58:07.183
NEED TO LOOK AT THAT BUT I THINK.

00:58:07.250 --> 00:58:08.484
FIRST AND FOREMOST WE NEED TO

00:58:08.551 --> 00:58:18.928
LOOK AT THE THE COMMON

00:58:18.995 --> 00:58:20.163
DENOMINATOR HERE IS THAT WE ARE

00:58:20.230 --> 00:58:21.764
HURTING BUSINESS WE ARE HURTING

00:58:21.831 --> 00:58:22.165
JOBS.

00:58:22.232 --> 00:58:24.100
AND WE'RE SENDING A HUGE I I

00:58:24.167 --> 00:58:25.969
GUESS IT'S ALMOST FUNDAMENTAL TO

00:58:26.035 --> 00:58:28.071
THE ECONOMY OF OUR NATION.

00:58:28.137 --> 00:58:30.073
OUT OF BUSINESS -- IN PERHAPS A

00:58:30.139 --> 00:58:31.241
SHORTER TIME THAN YOU WOULD

00:58:31.307 --> 00:58:32.642
IMAGINE SO THAT'S WHILE BE

00:58:32.709 --> 00:58:33.142
OPPOSING IT TODAY BUT I

00:58:33.209 --> 00:58:34.577
APPRECIATETHE FACT THAT YOU

00:58:34.644 --> 00:58:36.579
LOOK AT THESE THINGS ASSEMBLY

00:58:36.646 --> 00:58:38.248
MEMBER TEAM AND WE WE NEED TO DO

00:58:38.314 --> 00:58:40.316
THAT FLOW -- GOOD FOR YOU ON

00:58:40.383 --> 00:58:41.384
THAT OUT BUT BETTER FOR YOU IF

00:58:41.451 --> 00:58:42.886
YOU TAKE A STEP BACK AND AND

00:58:42.952 --> 00:58:44.287
CONSIDER SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT

00:58:44.354 --> 00:58:45.555
HAVE BEEN BROUGHT UP.

00:58:45.622 --> 00:58:47.790
BY OUR FINE FINE RETAIL

00:58:47.857 --> 00:58:54.397
INDUSTRIES FAIR MANUFACTURES.

00:58:54.464 --> 00:58:55.431
I'VE ACTUALLY JUST A QUICK

00:58:55.498 --> 00:58:56.366
COUPLE POINTS OUT AGAIN THE BILL

00:58:56.432 --> 00:58:57.267
DOESN'T GO INTO EFFECT ON

00:58:57.333 --> 00:58:59.369
JANUARY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO

00:58:59.435 --> 00:58:59.936
WAS SO WEAK THAT PLEA FACTOR

00:59:00.003 --> 00:59:00.203
THAT IN.

00:59:00.270 --> 00:59:01.804
WE EXEMPTED OUT SMALL BUSINESSES

00:59:01.871 --> 00:59:02.872
THAT GROSS UNDER TWO MILLION

00:59:02.939 --> 00:59:03.940
DOLLARS A YEAR.

00:59:04.007 --> 00:59:07.610
WHICH WE THINK BALK EXAM THE

00:59:07.677 --> 00:59:09.145
HUGE MAJORITY OF SMALL

00:59:09.212 --> 00:59:09.779
BUSINESSES SO THAT WAS SOMETHING

00:59:09.846 --> 00:59:12.482
THAT WE ACTUALLY TOOK INTO --

00:59:12.548 --> 00:59:12.916
INTO OUR THINKING.

00:59:12.982 --> 00:59:14.284
IN TERMS OF RESTAURANTS WE WERE

00:59:14.350 --> 00:59:15.885
VERY SENSE ABOUT RESTAURANTS

00:59:15.952 --> 00:59:17.253
EVEN THOUGH THEY REMAIN OPPOSED.

00:59:17.320 --> 00:59:19.055
THAT DAY AGAIN IT'S VERY COMMON

00:59:19.122 --> 00:59:21.024
FOR THEM 2% A BILL TO YOU SO

00:59:21.090 --> 00:59:21.758
THAT BILL IS NOT.

00:59:21.824 --> 00:59:23.526
TOUCHED IN TERMS OF THE BILL

00:59:23.593 --> 00:59:24.360
WHEN THEY PRESENTED TO YOU

00:59:24.427 --> 00:59:27.163
OBVIOUSLY THAT'S A PAPER BILL --

00:59:27.230 --> 00:59:33.102
AND SO AGAIN -- WE DID NOT.

00:59:33.169 --> 00:59:34.904
DISALLOW THAT OBVIOUSLY IS JUST

00:59:34.971 --> 00:59:35.905
BASICALLY IF YOU PAY FOR A

00:59:35.972 --> 00:59:37.173
CREDIT CARD WHETHER OR NOT THAT

00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.574
CREDIT CARD BILL COMES BACK THE

00:59:38.641 --> 00:59:40.009
SECOND TIME IF YOU DON'T WANT

00:59:40.076 --> 00:59:42.178
THAT THAT'S WHERE WE WILL BE A

00:59:42.245 --> 00:59:43.513
PART.

00:59:43.579 --> 00:59:45.548
WELL IT'S INTERESTING SOME OF

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:47.183
THE RECEIPTS THAT WE GET A LATE

00:59:47.250 --> 00:59:47.884
FEE FROM OFF.

00:59:47.951 --> 00:59:50.353
THOSE WHO ARE ON GIVING COUPON

00:59:50.420 --> 00:59:51.154
SAVING COUPONS.

00:59:51.220 --> 00:59:52.488
ARE I GET A RECEIPT THAT SHOWS

00:59:52.555 --> 00:59:53.990
HOW MUCH MONEY I'VE SAVED BY

00:59:54.057 --> 00:59:54.891
BUYING CERTAIN PRODUCTS ON THE

00:59:54.958 --> 00:59:55.692
OTHERS THAT'S THE THING IT'S

00:59:55.758 --> 00:59:59.729
GREAT CONSUMER INFORMATION.

00:59:59.796 --> 01:00:00.496
THAT WILL BE ELIMINATED.

01:00:00.563 --> 01:00:02.065
I AM NOT SURE THAT THAT'S IN THE

01:00:02.131 --> 01:00:02.632
BEST INTERESTS OF CONSUMERS

01:00:02.699 --> 01:00:04.167
EITHER IN THE MARKETING THAT OUR

01:00:04.233 --> 01:00:05.268
RETAILERS DO THAT HELP US MAKE

01:00:05.335 --> 01:00:07.537
BETTER CHOICES. TO STRETCH THAT

01:00:07.603 --> 01:00:10.073
DOLLAR THAT WE HAVE FULL OF THE

01:00:10.139 --> 01:00:11.941
THINGS NEED TO BE CONSIDERED

01:00:12.008 --> 01:00:12.842
ISSUE GO FORWARD.

01:00:12.909 --> 01:00:14.310
THAT INFORMATION TERMS OF HOW

01:00:14.377 --> 01:00:19.949
MUCH MONEY YOU SAVE SAY FROM THE

01:00:20.016 --> 01:00:21.284
GROCERY STORE IS NOT UNLIMITED.

01:00:21.351 --> 01:00:24.954
IT'S IT'S JUST BASICALLY ALL THE

01:00:25.021 --> 01:00:27.223
FIVE FEET AFTER THAT IF IF THEIR

01:00:27.290 --> 01:00:29.726
COUPONS OR PROMOTIONAL SO.

01:00:29.792 --> 01:00:30.293
THOSE WOULD BE ELIMINATED.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.494
IF YOU PUT HIM ON THE BACK OF

01:00:31.561 --> 01:00:32.128
THE RECEIPT THAT'S TOTALLY FINE

01:00:32.195 --> 01:00:33.529
BECAUSE AGAIN WE'RE ASKING FOR

01:00:33.596 --> 01:00:34.697
RECEIPT THAT'S NO LONGER THAN

01:00:34.764 --> 01:00:38.901
THAT THE TRANSACTION INFORMATION.

01:00:38.968 --> 01:00:43.306
I CAN JUST GET A JUST TO KIND OF

01:00:43.373 --> 01:00:43.873
ZERO ELEVEN YOU'RE DOING TWO

01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:44.741
VER DIFFERENT THINGS HERE RIGHT

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:45.641
YOU'VE GOT THE ISSUE OF WASTE

01:00:45.708 --> 01:00:46.409
REDUCTION.

01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:47.477
AND THEN YOU'VE GOT THE B. P. A.

01:00:47.543 --> 01:00:51.481
B. PS -- BAN EFFECTIVELY.

01:00:51.547 --> 01:00:55.184
AND I GUESS I JUST WANNA HAVE

01:00:55.251 --> 01:00:56.285
SCRATCH SERVICE LITTLE MORE MAY

01:00:56.352 --> 01:00:57.387
I HEAR YOU IN TERMS OF EARLY

01:00:57.453 --> 01:00:58.788
INDICATORS -- BUT THE QUESTION

01:00:58.855 --> 01:01:00.556
IS DO WE HOW DO YOU RESPOND TO

01:01:00.623 --> 01:01:02.125
THIS CONCERN ABOUT ABOUT ONE

01:01:02.191 --> 01:01:03.459
AWESOME PART OF WHY I WAS

01:01:03.526 --> 01:01:04.394
PURSUING THE GREEN CHEMISTRY

01:01:04.460 --> 01:01:05.228
BILL YOU KNOW VERY WELL IS THAT

01:01:05.294 --> 01:01:06.229
WE ACTUALLY HAVE.

01:01:06.295 --> 01:01:09.165
A MORE SYSTEMATIC APPROACH --

01:01:09.232 --> 01:01:10.133
THE GREEK CAM SHE PROGRAM WAS

01:01:10.199 --> 01:01:11.300
ABSOLUTELY NOT STRONG ENOUGH AND

01:01:11.367 --> 01:01:12.368
WHAT DIDN'T HAVE THE KIND OF

01:01:12.435 --> 01:01:13.336
TOOLS THAT I NEED TO DO THE WORK

01:01:13.403 --> 01:01:14.504
IT IT NEEDS TO DO.

01:01:14.570 --> 01:01:15.138
AND THAT'S WHY WE'RE TRYING TO

01:01:15.204 --> 01:01:17.507
GIVE THEM THOSE TOOLS AND I DO

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:19.242
APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT

01:01:19.308 --> 01:01:21.577
INDUSTRIES YEAH Và WANT TO WORK

01:01:21.644 --> 01:01:24.313
WITH US ON THAT -- YOU KNOW IT

01:01:24.380 --> 01:01:24.947
THERE ARE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT

01:01:25.014 --> 01:01:26.249
ARE.

01:01:26.315 --> 01:01:29.585
CLEAR IT'S OBVIOUS -- BUT BUT

01:01:29.652 --> 01:01:31.320
EARLY INDICATORS IS THAT ENOUGH.

01:01:31.387 --> 01:01:34.257
TO TO DO A ONE OFF BAND.

01:01:34.323 --> 01:01:36.059
YEAH I THINK -- AS I TESTIFIED

01:01:36.125 --> 01:01:38.261
EARLIER THE LEGISLATURE CAN AND

01:01:38.327 --> 01:01:40.329
SHOULD DO ONE OFFS ON OCCASION

01:01:40.396 --> 01:01:43.399
AND DTS YES HE SUPPORTED AB

01:01:43.466 --> 01:01:44.767
THIRTEEN NINETEEN THE BPA BAND

01:01:44.834 --> 01:01:46.335
AND TWENTY ELEVEN SAYING.

01:01:46.402 --> 01:01:48.037
THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROGRAM WILL

01:01:48.104 --> 01:01:49.939
BE MOVING KIND OF SLOWLY FOR

01:01:50.006 --> 01:01:51.274
THAT WAS FORESHADOWING.

01:01:51.340 --> 01:01:53.242
AND SAID WE HAVE NO PROBLEM WE

01:01:53.309 --> 01:01:56.012
SUPPORT THAT AFTER THAT THE STM

01:01:56.079 --> 01:01:57.246
ANY Q. PASSED AND WAS SIGNED.

01:01:57.313 --> 01:01:58.147
I THINK IT'S THE SAME THING HERE

01:01:58.214 --> 01:01:59.115
THERE'S STRONG EVIDENCE NOW

01:01:59.182 --> 01:02:01.651
ABOUT THE P. S. 81%.

01:02:01.717 --> 01:02:05.121
OF AMERICANS HAVE BE PS IN THEIR

01:02:05.188 --> 01:02:06.689
YEAR AND THIRST THAT SAYS NOT

01:02:06.756 --> 01:02:09.325
JUST BE PSP PS SO I THINK IT

01:02:09.392 --> 01:02:11.227
WILL BE -- FORMALIZES

01:02:11.294 --> 01:02:13.629
REGRETTABLE SUBSTITUTION ONE DAY

01:02:13.696 --> 01:02:16.599
BY PROP SIXTY FIVE BECAUSE OF

01:02:16.666 --> 01:02:17.834
THE REPRODUCTIVE EFFECTS OF THIS

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:19.602
HORMONAL LIKE CHEMICAL IN YOUR

01:02:19.669 --> 01:02:20.403
BODY.

01:02:20.470 --> 01:02:21.704
IN THE LEGISLATURE I THINK

01:02:21.771 --> 01:02:23.639
SOMETIMES HAS TO STEP OUT A

01:02:23.706 --> 01:02:25.141
LITTLE BIT AHEAD SAY THERE'S

01:02:25.208 --> 01:02:26.342
GOOD EVIDENCE NOW WHAT ARE WE

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:28.411
WAITING FOR LESS LEAD THE NATION

01:02:28.478 --> 01:02:29.378
LIKE WE DID WITH BPA.

01:02:29.445 --> 01:02:30.546
IN BABY BOTTLES AND BY THE WAY

01:02:30.613 --> 01:02:32.515
BPA THE REASON I CAME UP AND BE

01:02:32.582 --> 01:02:34.984
PS IS IT IT MAY NOT LEECHES

01:02:35.051 --> 01:02:36.686
READILY OUT OF PLASTIC BOTTLES.

01:02:36.752 --> 01:02:38.321
SO YOU SEE BPA FREE DRINKING

01:02:38.387 --> 01:02:40.723
BOTTLE IS PROBABLY GOT PPS BUT

01:02:40.790 --> 01:02:41.691
IT'S JUST AS LITTLE MORE

01:02:41.757 --> 01:02:43.392
RESILIENT TO SIGN IN HOT WATER

01:02:43.459 --> 01:02:44.594
THINGS LIKE THAT.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:46.129
BUT IN THERMAL PAPER IT'S

01:02:46.195 --> 01:02:48.297
READILY LEACHED SO THAT'S A

01:02:48.364 --> 01:02:49.765
DIFFERENT APPLICATION AND WE'RE

01:02:49.832 --> 01:02:56.239
CONCERNED ABOUT THAT APPLICATION

01:02:56.305 --> 01:02:58.241
FOR PPS.

01:02:58.307 --> 01:03:00.810
YEAH I MEAN ALL I ALSO ONE OF

01:03:00.877 --> 01:03:02.044
THE THING YOU KNOW THAT THAT

01:03:02.111 --> 01:03:02.845
BOTH BECAME THE PS ARE

01:03:02.912 --> 01:03:04.380
CONSIDERED CONTAMINANTS BY THE

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:05.348
WASTE INDUSTRY WITH THE REST OF

01:03:05.414 --> 01:03:06.883
THE PAPER RECYCLING STREAM.

01:03:06.949 --> 01:03:08.317
OF COURSE THERE A LOT OF

01:03:08.384 --> 01:03:11.120
CONTAMINANTS -- INCLUDING PETE

01:03:11.187 --> 01:03:13.523
AGREES -- THAT IMPACT THE

01:03:13.589 --> 01:03:17.126
ABILITY OF US -- YOUR ABILITY --

01:03:17.193 --> 01:03:18.427
TO TO YOU KNOW -- TO TO RECYCLE

01:03:18.494 --> 01:03:21.864
PAPER BUT YEAH THIS IS.

01:03:21.931 --> 01:03:25.001
THIS IS THE THIS IS A TOUGH

01:03:25.067 --> 01:03:26.669
ISSUE BECAUSE I YOU KNOW YOU'RE

01:03:26.736 --> 01:03:27.303
DOING A LOT OF DIFFERENT THINGS

01:03:27.370 --> 01:03:30.606
HERE AND AND I WONDER WHETHER

01:03:30.673 --> 01:03:33.676
WHERE.

01:03:33.743 --> 01:03:36.179
WHAT I I I I JUST WANT I I'M I'M

01:03:36.245 --> 01:03:37.813
I GUESS I'M STRUGGLING WITH LIKE

01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:39.081
THE EXTENT TO WHICH WE?

01:03:39.148 --> 01:03:40.416
RESPECT THE EXISTING SYSTEMS

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:42.351
THAT WE HAVE IN PLACE WHICH ARE.

01:03:42.418 --> 01:03:44.253
AND MAN MADE WHAT MAYBE TODAY WE

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:44.854
DON'T FEEL AS OF THE EXISTING

01:03:44.921 --> 01:03:45.955
SYSTEMS ARE.

01:03:46.022 --> 01:03:47.023
ARE.

01:03:47.089 --> 01:03:49.058
ACTIVATED ENOUGH FOR FAST ENOUGH

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.426
RESPONSIVE ENOUGH AND I

01:03:50.493 --> 01:03:51.794
CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THAT THAT'S

01:03:51.861 --> 01:03:52.428
WHY I'M RUNNING THE OTHER BILL

01:03:52.495 --> 01:03:53.729
AND AND EVEN IF THE BILL PASSES

01:03:53.796 --> 01:03:55.798
IT'S NOT GOING TO BE FAST ENOUGH

01:03:55.865 --> 01:03:57.333
FOR ME MANY RESPECTS AND THAT'S

01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:59.268
WHAT KIND OF LEADS ME IN FAVOR

01:03:59.335 --> 01:04:02.838
THIS BUT I AM -- I CONTINUE TO

01:04:02.905 --> 01:04:03.406
BE ABLE CONCERNED ABOUT THAT

01:04:03.472 --> 01:04:03.706
[inaudible]

01:04:03.773 --> 01:04:05.641
ABOUT.

01:04:05.708 --> 01:04:07.343
THE THE THE THE RIGOR WITH WHICH

01:04:07.410 --> 01:04:10.112
WE ADDRESS THESE KINDS OF ISSUES

01:04:10.179 --> 01:04:11.247
SO THE RICHER OFFRAMP FOR THE

01:04:11.314 --> 01:04:13.082
BILL WAS TO GO THE THE RECEIPT

01:04:13.149 --> 01:04:16.219
DIRECTION -- BASED ON PRIVACY

01:04:16.285 --> 01:04:18.054
CONCERNS IN BASED ON CONCERNS

01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.755
THAT PEOPLE DIDN'T NECESSARILY

01:04:19.822 --> 01:04:21.457
READILY EMBRACE THE HE RECEIVED

01:04:21.524 --> 01:04:23.960
OFFRAMP THIS WAS A COMPROMISE

01:04:24.026 --> 01:04:25.294
THAT WAS TAKEN OUT OF THE SIMPLY

01:04:25.361 --> 01:04:27.863
PREPARATIONS TO TO GO FOR THE

01:04:27.930 --> 01:04:30.299
GPS TO BPA FREE.

01:04:30.366 --> 01:04:32.702
PAPER I THINK OUR ORIGINAL FOCUS

01:04:32.768 --> 01:04:36.305
AND OUR OUR FOCUS REMAINS IS THE

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:37.573
GOING BACK TO CENTER MY COUNTIES

01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:38.241
POINT THE PRODUCTION OF THE

01:04:38.307 --> 01:04:38.874
WASTE.

01:04:38.941 --> 01:04:41.010
AT THE ACTUAL RECEIPT THAT YOU

01:04:41.077 --> 01:04:42.645
DON'T NEED THAT YOU DON'T REALLY

01:04:42.712 --> 01:04:44.547
WANT HOW DO YOU REDUCE THAT AND

01:04:44.614 --> 01:04:47.250
SO IT'S REALLY THE FOCUS ON THE

01:04:47.316 --> 01:04:48.517
RECEIPT UPON REQUEST.

01:04:48.584 --> 01:04:50.586
MAKING SURE THAT THAT CAN BE

01:04:50.653 --> 01:04:53.856
ACCOMMODATED -- THE COMPROMISE

01:04:53.923 --> 01:04:57.293
WAS ALSO ALLOWING PEOPLE OF

01:04:57.360 --> 01:04:59.428
CONSECUTIVE.

01:04:59.495 --> 01:05:01.163
THESE ARE STORES THAT WANTED TO

01:05:01.230 --> 01:05:02.431
CONTINUE.

01:05:02.498 --> 01:05:05.001
TO GIVE RECEIPTS OR ADAM ABOUT

01:05:05.067 --> 01:05:06.902
RECEIPTS LIKE LIKE THE GROCERS

01:05:06.969 --> 01:05:07.536
YOU HEARD FROM MISTER MARINO.

01:05:07.603 --> 01:05:08.671
ON MAKING SURE THAT THEY HAVE

01:05:08.738 --> 01:05:12.208
THAT OPTION TO HAVE BPA PPS FREE

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:13.409
PAPERS SO AGAIN THAT WAS THAT

01:05:13.476 --> 01:05:14.176
WAS SORT OF LIKE THE COMPROMISE

01:05:14.243 --> 01:05:15.011
BUT THE FOCUS WAS REALLY.

01:05:15.077 --> 01:05:17.246
MAKING SURE THAT EVERY RETAILER

01:05:17.313 --> 01:05:20.816
WE COULD ACCOMMODATE THE PAPER

01:05:20.883 --> 01:05:22.251
SEE TOMORROW.

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:23.719
RIGHT GET THAT BUT BUT NOW THAT

01:05:23.786 --> 01:05:24.487
THE BILL DOES.

01:05:24.553 --> 01:05:25.755
IT DOES IT JUST PRY THE OPTION

01:05:25.821 --> 01:05:27.023
IT SAYS THAT THE PAPER PROOF OF

01:05:27.089 --> 01:05:29.292
PURCHASE IF PROVIDED -- SHALL

01:05:29.358 --> 01:05:32.061
NOT CONTAIN BPA OR BBS CORRECT

01:05:32.128 --> 01:05:34.363
SO IT'S NOT A IT'S NOT AN OPTION.

01:05:34.430 --> 01:05:35.431
RIGHT SO THAT THAT WAS AN

01:05:35.498 --> 01:05:40.236
AMENDMENT THAT WE TOOK OFFICE IN

01:05:40.303 --> 01:05:42.405
THE PREPARATION THAT'S RIGHT.

01:05:42.471 --> 01:05:43.339
SO SO WE PROVISIONS ADDED THAT

01:05:43.406 --> 01:05:45.808

CALIFORNIA.

01:10:55.718 --> 01:10:57.319
RIGHT NOW I THINK THAT WE

PERCEIVE THAT WERE RECYCLING IS

01:10:58.587 --> 01:10:59.121

CURBSIDE RECYCLING BIN.

01:11:00.689 --> 01:11:03.359
AND THE WHOLE SITUATION IN CHINA

01:11:03.425 --> 01:11:05.628
HAS COMMUNICATED TO US THAT THAT

01:11:05.694 --> 01:11:07.262
IS NOT RECYCLING.

01:11:07.329 --> 01:11:09.932
WHAT -- CENTER SKINNER HAS TOLD

01:11:09.999 --> 01:11:12.768
US SINCE DAY ONE IS THAT

01:11:12.835 --> 01:11:14.670
RECYCLING IS WHEN SOMEBODY BUYS

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.138
THE MATERIAL WHEN THERE'S A

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:17.640
MARKET FOR THE MATERIAL.

01:11:17.706 --> 01:11:19.108
AND WE'VE DONE A LOT IN THIS

01:11:19.174 --> 01:11:22.244
LEGISLATURE TO COMPEL CONSUMERS

01:11:22.311 --> 01:11:24.480
TO DO MORE ON COLLECTION WE'VE

01:11:30.653 --> 01:11:31.453
THIS MATERIAL.

01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.022
THE ECONOMY HAS MOTIVATED.

CLEAN THAT MATERIAL BUT ALL OF

01:11:39.628 --> 01:11:41.997
THAT IS A WASTE OF TIME UNLESS

01:11:42.064 --> 01:11:43.699
SOMEBODY IS WILLING TO BUY THE

01:11:43.766 --> 01:11:44.700
MATERIAL.

01:11:44.767 --> 01:11:47.569

THIS IS A BILL ABOUT.

01:18:42.284 --> 01:18:42.984
MARKETS ABOUT TRYING TO CHANGE

01:18:43.051 --> 01:18:44.252
MARKETS WHEN WE LOOK AT THE

01:18:44.319 --> 01:18:47.255
CHINESE SOARED P. E. T. WAS NOT

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:49.191
IMPACTED.

01:18:49.257 --> 01:18:50.425
SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE CHINESE

01:18:50.492 --> 01:18:52.427
STORE THERE WAS NO P. E. T. THAT

01:18:52.494 --> 01:18:53.929

01:18:53.995 --> 01:18:55.831
ON MARKET MORE TALK ABOUT US THE

CHINESE SORT THAT'S THREE THREE

01:18:58.700 --> 01:19:00.602
SEVEN SO WHEN WE LOOK AT PT THAT

01:19:00.669 --> 01:19:02.170
IS A A GLOBAL MARKET.

01:19:02.237 --> 01:19:04.172
AND SO THE REAL QUESTION IS WHAT

01:19:04.239 --> 01:19:06.408

SHORTER TERM TIMELINE.

01:19:16.818 --> 01:19:17.619
THE WHAT'S THAT GOING TO DO A

01:19:17.686 --> 01:19:18.520
ONE OF THE UNINTENDED

01:19:18.587 --> 01:19:20.155
CONSEQUENCES SO WE WOULD SAY.

01:19:20.222 --> 01:19:22.858
LET'S START THE OF THE THE

01:19:22.924 --> 01:19:24.926
MANDATE AND LET'S GET IT ROLLING

01:19:24.993 --> 01:19:27.863
AND GO THROUGH. TO TWENTY TWENTY

01:19:27.929 --> 01:19:30.065

01:19:33.368 --> 01:19:34.503
ANOTHER SIDE BILLS THAT WILL

01:19:34.569 --> 01:19:36.972
TAKE OVER THE OUT YEARS AND

01:19:37.038 --> 01:19:41.476
MINIMIZE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES.

TALK ABOUT BOX WATERS BETTER

01:19:50.418 --> 01:19:51.686
ABOUT THIS UPSTAIRS IN OUR DEAL

01:19:51.753 --> 01:19:52.254
IN THERE'S A PERCEPTION THAT

01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:53.455
THIS IS BETTER.

01:19:53.522 --> 01:19:54.456
THIS IS SEVENTY SIX RECITE

01:19:54.523 --> 01:19:55.056
PERCENT RECYCLE ACCORDING TO

THEIR OWN WEBSITE.

01:19:55.924 --> 01:19:59.161
THIS BOTTLE IS 1100% RECYCLED.

01:19:59.227 --> 01:20:01.329
THIS BOTTLE IS NOT REALLY RISKS

01:20:01.396 --> 01:20:03.565
ARE BOXES NOT REALLY RECYCLED IN

01:20:03.632 --> 01:20:05.534
OUR CURRENT SYSTEM THIS BOXES

01:20:05.600 --> 01:20:08.069
RECYCLE OUT A 75% RATE.

01:20:08.136 --> 01:20:09.604
THIS BOX IS ALSO NOT COMPOSED

01:20:09.671 --> 01:20:11.606
DOUBLE ZERO COURT IN THE WEBSITE

01:20:11.673 --> 01:20:12.574
IS ZERO POSSIBLE IF YOU LOOK

01:20:12.641 --> 01:20:14.009
INTO IT NO PASSED AROUND.

01:20:14.075 --> 01:20:15.277
IT HAS METAL ON THE INSIDE

01:20:15.343 --> 01:20:17.712
FOOTBALL BOX WATER BUT IS BETTER

01:20:17.779 --> 01:20:19.147
IS A GREAT TRADE MARK.

01:20:19.214 --> 01:20:20.482
IT'S ACTUALLY NOT REALITY SO

01:20:20.549 --> 01:20:22.617
WHEN WE LOOK AT THESE WE NEED TO

01:20:22.684 --> 01:20:24.152
LOOK AT THE REALITIES OF THE

01:20:24.219 --> 01:20:26.655
ROWS OF PT VERSES THREE THROUGH.

01:20:26.721 --> 01:20:28.590
SEVEN THE REALITIES OF THE

MARKETS AND WHAT THIS IS GOING

01:20:30.225 --> 01:20:31.726
TO GOING FORWARD WE ABSOLUTELY

01:20:31.793 --> 01:20:33.795
AGREE THAT WE SHOULD PROP UP THE

01:20:33.862 --> 01:20:36.031
MARKET. TO GET TO GO ON HEALTH

01:20:36.097 --> 01:20:36.898
RECLAIM RESULT THE P. R. C. C.

01:20:36.965 --> 01:20:37.999
HAS BEEN INVOLVED IN THIS FOR

01:20:38.066 --> 01:20:41.836
THIRTY TWO YEARS IN TRYING TO

01:20:41.903 --> 01:20:42.337
BUILD DOMESTIC MARKETS A

01:20:42.404 --> 01:20:43.305
CALIFORNIA.

01:20:43.371 --> 01:20:43.905
THERE ARE TWO PRODUCTS AND THE

01:20:43.972 --> 01:20:45.473
VAST MAJORITY NINETIES PERCENT

01:20:45.540 --> 01:20:47.108
PLUS.

01:20:47.175 --> 01:20:49.044
E. T. RECYCLE CALIFORNIAN AND

01:20:49.110 --> 01:20:50.545
PRODUCED CALIFORNIA.

01:20:50.612 --> 01:20:52.914
STAYS A CALIFORNIA GOES.

01:20:52.981 --> 01:20:55.183
TO TO MARKETS BOTTLES AND FOOD

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:56.184
PACKAGING.

01:20:56.251 --> 01:20:57.385
THOSE ARE THE TWO THINGS THAT WE

01:20:57.452 --> 01:20:58.553
MAKE IN CALIFORNIA HERE.

01:20:58.620 --> 01:21:02.123
AND SO WE DO HAVE A CLOSED LOOP

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.325
AND WISH THEN ABSOLUTELY.

01:21:03.391 --> 01:21:04.826
WELL FOOD PACKAGING AGAIN WILL

01:21:04.893 --> 01:21:06.628
BE MORE IMPACT BY TEN EIGHTY THE

01:21:06.695 --> 01:21:07.596
BOTTLES.

01:21:07.662 --> 01:21:09.464
OF WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSE THAT

01:21:09.531 --> 01:21:11.066
LOOP EVEN MORE MORE AND AGAIN WE

01:21:11.132 --> 01:21:12.234
SUPPORT.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:15.971
MOVING FORWARD WITH A MORE

01:21:16.037 --> 01:21:17.105
MEASURED APPROACH.

01:21:17.172 --> 01:21:18.907
SIMILAR TO THE E. U. THE E. YOU

01:21:18.974 --> 01:21:22.043
STUDIED THIS FOR SEVERAL YEARS

01:21:22.110 --> 01:21:24.212
THEY WENT THROUGH -- AND DID YOU

01:21:24.279 --> 01:21:26.414
KNOW ECONOMIC MODELS AND CREATED

01:21:26.481 --> 01:21:28.650
A MODEL THAT SAID BASICALLY 25%

01:21:28.717 --> 01:21:30.919
BY TWENTY A TWENTY FIVE AND 30%

01:21:30.986 --> 01:21:32.721
BY.

01:21:32.787 --> 01:21:33.321
TWENTY THIRTY THOSE TYPES OF

01:21:33.388 --> 01:21:36.358
NUMBERS ARE ARE REALISTIC AND WE

01:21:36.424 --> 01:21:37.359
LOOK AT THE MEMBERS THE AMERICAN

01:21:37.425 --> 01:21:38.793
BEVERAGE ASSOCIATION MANY OF

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.662
THEM HAVE SIGNIFICANT PLEDGES.

01:21:40.729 --> 01:21:42.264
AND AND WE STAND BY THAT THAT'S

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:44.799
WHY WE SUPPORT A MOVING.

01:21:44.866 --> 01:21:48.703
SOMETHING FORWARD THAT HAS A

01:21:48.770 --> 01:21:50.438
MORE MEASURED APPROACH.

01:21:50.505 --> 01:21:52.040
BUT THERE'S OTHER.

01:21:52.107 --> 01:21:52.807
INDEPENDENT BALL SKEWS ME STORE

01:21:52.874 --> 01:21:54.843
BRANDS AT THAT HAVE.

01:21:54.909 --> 01:21:55.477
ZERO AT THIS POINT SO TO GET TO

01:21:55.543 --> 01:21:56.111
THE NUMBERS THAT ARE IN THIS

01:21:56.177 --> 01:21:57.545
BILL OR SUGGESTED BY THE

01:21:57.612 --> 01:22:00.315
CONSULTANT IN ONE YEAR ONE YEAR.

01:22:00.382 --> 01:22:02.784
OF FROM ENACTMENT IT WILL CREATE

01:22:02.851 --> 01:22:05.654
SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES FOR ALL

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.155
PLAYERS IN THE INDUSTRY BOTH THE

01:22:07.222 --> 01:22:08.089
BOTTLER.

01:22:08.156 --> 01:22:09.791
BUT THE RECYCLER THE THE

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:11.059
RECLAIMER AND THEN FINALLY

01:22:11.126 --> 01:22:12.427
BEFORE WE GET DONE WE'VE ALSO

01:22:12.494 --> 01:22:13.628
SEEN.

01:22:13.695 --> 01:22:15.330
SOME OF THE ENTITIES ARE ON THE

01:22:15.397 --> 01:22:18.233
FRONT AND REAR REDUCED IN AND

01:22:18.300 --> 01:22:20.101
COLLECTED MATERIAL SO WE NEED TO

01:22:20.168 --> 01:22:21.803
DO BETTER AND HOW MUCH MATERIAL

01:22:21.870 --> 01:22:23.938
WE COULD GET COLLECTED THE E. U..

HAS A GOAL OF 90% A COLLECTION

01:22:26.074 --> 01:22:27.509
WORDS SEVENTY FIVE BUT WE'RE

01:22:27.575 --> 01:22:28.610
STILL A SUCCESS STORY THAT'S

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.378
PROP THAT'S THE BEST COLLECTION

01:22:30.445 --> 01:22:31.646
RATE.

01:22:31.713 --> 01:22:32.781
IN THE UNITED STATES AND A

01:22:32.847 --> 01:22:35.817
BETTER THAN EVEN A EUROPE ON PT.

01:22:35.884 --> 01:22:37.118
WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE THE CONTENT

01:22:37.185 --> 01:22:39.220

01:22:39.287 --> 01:22:41.089
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO DO BETTER?

01:22:41.156 --> 01:22:42.223
WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO CLOSE THE

01:22:42.290 --> 01:22:43.325
LOOP BUT WE NEED TO AVOID

01:22:43.391 --> 01:22:44.893
UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES WITH

01:23:32.807 --> 01:23:35.577
ANY -- OF VISUAL AIDS I WILL

01:23:35.643 --> 01:23:37.011
MAKE THAT MISTAKE AGAIN ALL OF

01:23:37.078 --> 01:23:39.581
BRING SOME NEXT TIME APOLOGIZE

01:23:39.647 --> 01:23:40.448
AND WE WANT YOU TO REDUCE WASTE

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:41.783
OIL THAT'S THAT'S WHAT I THOUGHT

01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:45.754
BUT NOW APPARENTLY THAT'S NOT

01:23:45.820 --> 01:23:46.755
THAT'S NOT THE STORY.

01:23:46.821 --> 01:23:47.522
BUT BUT A YOU KNOW A LOT OF THE

01:23:47.589 --> 01:23:48.890
GOOD WORK THAT'S BEING DONE IN

01:23:48.957 --> 01:23:49.791
INCREASING USE RECYCLING.

01:23:49.858 --> 01:23:52.260
IS BY OUR MEMBERS AND IT'S KIND

01:23:52.327 --> 01:23:53.995
OF IT'S IT'S BREAKING ITS PATH

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:55.630
BREAKING ITS ITS ITS QUALITY

01:23:55.697 --> 01:23:56.398
WORK.

01:23:56.464 --> 01:23:58.500
ON WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT IS A

01:23:58.566 --> 01:24:00.468
STATUTORY MANDATE THAT EVERYBODY

01:24:00.535 --> 01:24:01.636
ACHIEVE.

01:24:01.703 --> 01:24:03.004
KIND OF OUT LIAR RESULTS AND SO

01:24:03.071 --> 01:24:04.205
THAT'S THAT'S THE PIECE THAT

01:24:04.272 --> 01:24:05.774
WE'RE TRYING TO NAVIGATE AND TO

01:24:05.840 --> 01:24:06.875
TRY TO HELP WITH THIS.

01:24:06.941 --> 01:24:08.543
WE SAT DOWN TO SOME OF THE

01:24:08.610 --> 01:24:09.711
LARGEST PURCHASERS OF THEM

01:24:09.778 --> 01:24:11.112
RECYCLE MATERIAL WITH THE

01:24:11.179 --> 01:24:13.114
PROVIDERS AND CAME UP WITH A

01:24:13.181 --> 01:24:15.483
FRAMEWORK AND THAT'S THE THAT'S

01:24:15.550 --> 01:24:16.818
THE THING THAT WE THINK BEST

01:24:16.885 --> 01:24:18.186
INFORMS THIS AND WE ALSO THINK

01:24:18.253 --> 01:24:18.686
THAT.

01:24:18.753 --> 01:24:20.054
IF YOU LOOK AT THE E. U. AND I I

01:24:20.121 --> 01:24:20.955
HAVE.

01:24:21.022 --> 01:24:21.756
TO I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY

01:24:21.823 --> 01:24:23.658
COLLEAGUES THAT THAT THE E. YOU

01:24:23.725 --> 01:24:24.626
LOOK AT THIS FOR A VERY VERY

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:25.460
LONG TIME.

01:24:25.527 --> 01:24:27.629
AND ISN'T GOING ANYWHERE NEAR

01:24:27.695 --> 01:24:30.231
75% THAT THAT NUMBER -- IT IN

01:24:30.298 --> 01:24:31.533
OUR MINDS AS FOLKS THAT DO THIS

01:24:31.599 --> 01:24:33.701
KIND OF EVERY DAY WE CAN'T WE

01:24:33.768 --> 01:24:35.203
CAN'T UNDERSTAND HOW THAT COULD

01:24:35.270 --> 01:24:36.704
POSSIBLY HAPPEN SO THAT'S THAT'S

01:24:36.771 --> 01:24:38.540
REALLY OUR OUR PRIMARY CONCERNS

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:39.808
WE THINK THAT THE FRAMEWORK THAT

01:24:39.874 --> 01:24:41.776
WE PUT TOGETHER -- ONE OF THE

01:24:41.843 --> 01:24:43.178
INDIVIDUALS THAT THAT TESTIFIED

01:24:43.244 --> 01:24:44.279
IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL IS PART

01:24:44.345 --> 01:24:46.414
OF THAT FRAMEWORK -- WE CAME UP

01:24:46.481 --> 01:24:49.984
WITH -- 25% -- BY.

01:24:50.051 --> 01:24:50.852
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WE THINK THAT

01:24:50.919 --> 01:24:52.720
THAT IS DOABLE WE ALSO THINK

01:24:52.787 --> 01:24:53.354
THAT THE MARKET WOULD HAVE TO

01:24:53.421 --> 01:24:55.290
OPERATE INKIND OF UNPRECEDENTED

01:24:55.356 --> 01:24:55.623
LEE.

01:24:55.690 --> 01:24:58.092
EFFICIENT AND OTHER WAYS TO EVEN

01:24:58.159 --> 01:24:59.861
HIT THAT NUMBER AND SO -- THAT'S

01:24:59.928 --> 01:25:04.032
WHAT WE CAME UP YOU IS OBVIOUSLY

01:25:04.098 --> 01:25:04.899
I THINK SUPPORTS OUR FRAMEWORK.

01:25:04.966 --> 01:25:05.900
THIS IS AN ECONOMIC APPROACH AND

01:25:05.967 --> 01:25:09.404
AND IT SEEMS TO US TO BE HEAVILY

01:25:09.471 --> 01:25:10.972
HEAVILY HEAVILY A YOU KNOW KIND

01:25:11.039 --> 01:25:13.274
OF PUSHED ON THE DEMAND SIDE

01:25:13.341 --> 01:25:14.609
WE'RE WE'RE NOT SEEING THE SAME

01:25:14.676 --> 01:25:16.211
LEVEL OF ATTENTION.

01:25:16.277 --> 01:25:17.879
AND AFFECT ON THE SUPPLY SIDE

01:25:17.946 --> 01:25:19.481
NOT I WOULD SAY THAT THAT IN THE

01:25:19.547 --> 01:25:21.749
THE LAST LITTLE WHILE WE'VE HAD

01:25:21.816 --> 01:25:25.487

NOT MEASURED IN THE AGGREGATE

01:28:16.557 --> 01:28:18.626
THE UNPAID SEVEN IN THE HOUSE AS

BECAUSE IT SEEMS IT TALKS ABOUT

01:28:37.245 --> 01:28:39.013
THE AMBITIOUS NATURE OF THE BILL --

01:28:39.080 --> 01:28:40.114
AT LEAST THROUGH THE END OF THE

01:28:40.181 --> 01:28:42.050
DECADE MIGHT REQUIRE SOME.

01:28:42.116 --> 01:28:43.718

FROM LAST YEAR AS WELL AS WHAT

01:28:45.353 --> 01:28:45.887
HAPPENED IN EUROPE I THINK WE

01:28:45.953 --> 01:28:46.721
ARE STILL HOPEFUL THAT WE CAN

01:28:46.788 --> 01:28:49.657
FIND A COMPROMISE WITH ALL THE

01:28:49.724 --> 01:28:51.859
OPPOSITION [inaudible]

01:28:51.926 --> 01:28:54.028
ALL RIGHT.

01:28:54.095 --> 01:28:55.396

01:28:55.463 --> 01:28:57.331

I'M THANK YOU I REALLY

01:29:02.637 --> 01:29:04.172
APPRECIATE THAT WE HAVE A BILL

01:29:04.238 --> 01:29:05.707
THAT FINALLY NOT FINALLY BECAUSE

01:29:05.773 --> 01:29:07.608
WE'VE HAD OTHERS BUT STILL THAT

01:29:07.675 --> 01:29:08.509
THIS IS FOCUSED ON MARKETS

01:29:08.576 --> 01:29:08.810
[inaudible]

01:29:08.876 --> 01:29:12.380
AND OF WE'VE ALREADY HEARD FROM --

01:29:12.447 --> 01:29:13.915
REPRESENTED FROM CALIFORNIA

01:29:13.981 --> 01:29:15.383
WASTE ABOUT THE FACT THAT --

01:29:15.450 --> 01:29:16.651
RECYCLING IS NOT PUTTING

01:29:16.718 --> 01:29:18.653
SOMETHING IN A BEEN JUST ISN'T

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:21.355
AN UNLESS WE HAVE MARKETS SO

01:29:21.422 --> 01:29:23.224
IT'S NOT JUST THE PURCHASE OF

01:29:23.291 --> 01:29:24.525
THE STUFF WE SHOULD READ HER

01:29:24.592 --> 01:29:25.560
BAIL.

01:29:25.626 --> 01:29:27.328
IT IS THE REMANUFACTURE OF IT

01:29:27.395 --> 01:29:30.098
INTO A PRODUCT THAT IS RECYCLING

01:29:30.164 --> 01:29:31.232
IT'S A LOOP.

01:29:31.299 --> 01:29:33.201
AND UNLESS THE LOOP IS CLOSED WE

01:29:33.267 --> 01:29:34.902
DON'T HAVE ANY RECYCLING.

01:29:34.969 --> 01:29:36.237
SO WE KNOW NOW.

01:29:36.304 --> 01:29:38.239
RIGHT NOW WE'RE SORT OF FIXATED

01:29:38.306 --> 01:29:39.841
BECAUSE A CHINA BUT ACTUALLY

01:29:39.907 --> 01:29:42.643
WE'VE NOT HAD A CLOSED LOOP FOR

01:29:42.710 --> 01:29:44.312
EVEN PRIOR TO THAT.

01:29:44.378 --> 01:29:46.914
AND WE'VE HAD AND I THINK IT'S

01:29:46.981 --> 01:29:48.816
UNFORTUNATE BECAUSE SO MANY

01:29:48.883 --> 01:29:51.352
CALIFORNIANS ARE SO DEDICATED TO

01:29:51.419 --> 01:29:54.655
DO THE RIGHT THING IN OUR OUR

01:29:54.722 --> 01:29:56.090
PUBLIC TAKE UP RATE.

01:29:56.157 --> 01:29:58.059
OF WHAT THEY PERCEIVED TO BE

01:29:58.126 --> 01:30:00.027
RECYCLING WHICH IS PUTTING IN A

01:30:00.094 --> 01:30:02.196
BIN IS PHENOMENAL IT'S GREAT.

01:30:02.263 --> 01:30:04.232
BUT WE HAVEN'T THEN DELIVERED ON

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:09.103
THE OTHER SIDE OF SENDING THE

01:30:09.170 --> 01:30:10.104
RIGHT.

01:30:10.171 --> 01:30:10.938
ECONOMIC SIGNALS ARE MARKET

01:30:11.005 --> 01:30:12.540
SIGNALS TO INSURE THAT THAT

01:30:12.607 --> 01:30:14.742
MATERIAL THAT EVERYBODY PUTS IN

01:30:14.809 --> 01:30:17.378
THE BIN GETS RE MANUFACTURED.

01:30:17.445 --> 01:30:19.447
NOW YEARS AGO FOR EXAMPLE WHEN

01:30:19.514 --> 01:30:22.383
CALIFORNIA ADOPTED AB NINE

01:30:22.450 --> 01:30:23.518
THIRTY NINE WHICH WAS EIGHTY

01:30:23.584 --> 01:30:25.953
NINE I BELIEVE -- WE WERE VERY

01:30:26.020 --> 01:30:28.022
FIXATED THAT WE NEEDED MARKETS

01:30:28.089 --> 01:30:29.891
AND THERE WAS DIFFERENT EFFORTS

01:30:29.957 --> 01:30:32.026
INCLUDING EFFORTS TO REQUIRE

01:30:32.093 --> 01:30:33.761
WHICH PASSED REQUIRE THE STATE

01:30:33.828 --> 01:30:35.062
OF CALIFORNIA.

01:30:35.129 --> 01:30:36.764
THE PAPER WE PURCHASED HAD TO

01:30:36.831 --> 01:30:38.666
HAVE AN MINIMUM POST CONSUMER

01:30:38.733 --> 01:30:40.401
RECYCLED CONTENT BECAUSE WE KNEW

01:30:40.468 --> 01:30:42.270
WE HAD TO SEND THAT SIGNAL IF WE

01:30:42.336 --> 01:30:44.705
LOOK AT OUR JURISDICTIONS.

01:30:44.772 --> 01:30:45.840
LOCAL GOVERNMENTS UP AND DOWN

01:30:45.907 --> 01:30:47.809
THE STATE MANY OF THEM HAVE

01:30:47.875 --> 01:30:49.377
RULES AROUND THEIR OWN PREACHER

01:30:49.443 --> 01:30:50.711
PROCUREMENT.

01:30:50.778 --> 01:30:52.847
THAT THEY BY MINIMUM A RECYCLED

01:30:52.914 --> 01:30:56.083
CONTENT AND FOR IN THE DURING

01:30:56.150 --> 01:30:59.120
THAT TIME THERE WAS.

01:30:59.187 --> 01:31:01.622
NOT ENOUGH MANUFACTURING IN U.

01:31:01.689 --> 01:31:04.559
S. OF THAT USED THE SECONDARY

01:31:04.625 --> 01:31:05.993
MATERIALS BUT THERE WAS ROBUST

01:31:06.060 --> 01:31:07.195
MANUFACTURING.

01:31:07.261 --> 01:31:09.030
BUT LIKE SO MUCH ELSE OF THEIR

01:31:09.096 --> 01:31:12.066
MANUFACTURING SECTOR IN U. S..

01:31:12.133 --> 01:31:13.968
WE'VE WITH THE IT'S DIMINISH SO

01:31:14.035 --> 01:31:15.469
IN OTHER WORDS THERE IS FAR LESS

01:31:15.536 --> 01:31:17.004
MANUFACTURING.

01:31:17.071 --> 01:31:18.506
IN THE U. S. THAT WILL TAKE A

01:31:18.573 --> 01:31:20.741
SECONDARY MATERIAL AND RE

01:31:20.808 --> 01:31:22.143
MANUFACTURE IT.

01:31:22.210 --> 01:31:24.078
PARTLY WHY BECAUSE WE'VE NOT

01:31:24.145 --> 01:31:26.447
SENT THE RIGHT MARKET SIGNALS

01:31:26.514 --> 01:31:29.483
NOW WE HAPPEN TO HAVE COMPANIES

01:31:29.550 --> 01:31:31.719
IN CALIFORNIA.

01:31:31.786 --> 01:31:33.287
THAT DO YOU.

01:31:33.354 --> 01:31:36.057
PURCHASE THESE PLASTICS AND WILL

01:31:36.123 --> 01:31:37.825
RE MANUFACTURED THERE'S FEWER

01:31:37.892 --> 01:31:38.960
THAN THERE USED TO BE BUT WE

01:31:39.026 --> 01:31:40.094
HAVE THEM HERE.

01:31:40.161 --> 01:31:41.929
AND WHY SHOULDN'T WE HELP

01:31:41.996 --> 01:31:43.531
SUPPORT THEM.

01:31:43.598 --> 01:31:45.867
AND RATHER AND SO THAT THEY CAN

01:31:45.933 --> 01:31:49.103
COMPETE FAIRLY WITH THIS VIRGIN

01:31:49.170 --> 01:31:52.073
RESIN -- BECAUSE WE HAVE THE

01:31:52.139 --> 01:31:55.710
GOALS MEANING WE HAVE THE 75%

01:31:55.776 --> 01:31:58.646
GOAL FOR QUOTE UNQUOTE RECYCLING

01:31:58.713 --> 01:32:00.414
SO WORK COLLECTING THAT MUCH OF

01:32:00.481 --> 01:32:02.583
THE MATERIAL SO TO CLOSE THE

01:32:02.650 --> 01:32:04.919
LOOP WE HAVE TO MAKE THE MARKET

01:32:04.986 --> 01:32:05.453
SIGNAL.

01:32:05.519 --> 01:32:07.388
NOW WE HAVE SEEN AS CALIFORNIA

01:32:07.455 --> 01:32:09.857
INCREDIBLE SUCCESS WITH GOOD

01:32:09.924 --> 01:32:11.926
MARKET SIGNALS.

01:32:11.993 --> 01:32:14.829
THE RENEWABLE ENERGY WAS ONE OF

01:32:14.896 --> 01:32:18.266
THE NOTIONS THAT WAS CITED WEEK

01:32:18.332 --> 01:32:21.402
THE PRICE FOR A KILOWATT HOUR

01:32:21.469 --> 01:32:22.837
EVERY NEW BILLY GENERATED

01:32:22.904 --> 01:32:24.906
ELECTRICITY COMPETES FIND WITH

01:32:24.972 --> 01:32:26.574
EVERY OTHER GENERATION OF

01:32:26.641 --> 01:32:27.775
ELECTRICITY.

01:32:27.842 --> 01:32:30.211
PARTLY DUE TO THE APPROPRIATE

01:32:30.278 --> 01:32:32.280
MARKET SIGNALS THAT CALIFORNIA

01:32:32.346 --> 01:32:35.049
ENACTED -- EVEY IS HAVE COME

01:32:35.116 --> 01:32:38.352
DOWN IN PRICE AGAIN PARTLY DUE

01:32:38.419 --> 01:32:39.787
TO THE MARKET SIGNALS THAT

01:32:39.854 --> 01:32:41.088
CALIFORNIAN ACTED.

01:32:41.155 --> 01:32:43.691
THIS IS SOMETHING WHERE WE HAVE

01:32:43.758 --> 01:32:47.628
GOT TO ADOPT POLICIES TO SEND

01:32:47.695 --> 01:32:49.196
THOSE APPROPRIATE MARKET SIGNALS.

01:32:49.263 --> 01:32:50.898
NOW WHILE I CAN'T NECESSARILY

01:32:50.965 --> 01:32:52.533
GUARANTEE THAT WE'RE GOING TO

01:32:52.600 --> 01:32:54.035
SEE A LOT MORE.

01:32:54.101 --> 01:32:56.437
IN COUNTRY YOU'RE IN STATE

01:32:56.504 --> 01:32:59.807
MANUFACTURING FACILITIES -- COME

01:32:59.874 --> 01:33:01.842
ABOARD BUT IF IT DOES ALL THE

01:33:01.909 --> 01:33:03.744
BETTER BECAUSE THEN WE ARE

01:33:03.811 --> 01:33:05.613
CLOSING THE LOOP RIGHT HERE AND

01:33:05.680 --> 01:33:07.315
WE'RE EVEN REDUCING.

01:33:07.381 --> 01:33:09.250
THE ALL THE EMISSIONS RELATED TO

01:33:09.317 --> 01:33:10.484
SHIPPING IT OUT SOMEWHERE ELSE

01:33:10.551 --> 01:33:13.587
SO I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS BILL

01:33:13.654 --> 01:33:15.990
IT IS A GREAT MOVE IN EXACTLY

01:33:16.057 --> 01:33:17.325
THE RIGHT DIRECTION SO THAT

01:33:17.391 --> 01:33:18.492
CALIFORNIA'S.

01:33:18.559 --> 01:33:20.861
GOALS AROUND RECYCLING ARE REAL

01:33:20.928 --> 01:33:22.596
BECAUSE WE ARE ACTUALLY CLOSING

01:33:22.663 --> 01:33:24.665
THE LOOP AND THANK YOU FOR

01:33:24.732 --> 01:33:26.567
BRINGING IT [inaudible] THIRTY

01:33:26.634 --> 01:33:28.803
DOLLARS.

01:33:28.869 --> 01:33:29.603
THANK YOU CHAIR.

01:33:29.670 --> 01:33:30.805
SO WE HAVE WE'VE HAD A LOT OF

01:33:30.871 --> 01:33:32.840
CONVERSATION ABOUT I AGREE I

01:33:32.907 --> 01:33:34.742
WANT I WANT TO CLOSE THE TWO I

01:33:34.809 --> 01:33:35.242
THINK THIS GREAT I THINK

01:33:35.309 --> 01:33:35.543
CALIFORNIA.

01:33:35.609 --> 01:33:36.177
IS A LEADER [inaudible]

01:33:36.243 --> 01:33:39.847
BUT IT WAS CITED IN SOME OF THE

01:33:39.914 --> 01:33:41.349
TESTIMONY ABOUT YOU KNOW

01:33:41.415 --> 01:33:44.485
BASICALLY WE FORCED.

01:33:44.552 --> 01:33:46.187
RENEWABLES AND ENERGY.

01:33:46.253 --> 01:33:47.555
BUT TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING IS

01:33:47.621 --> 01:33:49.390
TOO MUCH OF A GOOD THING.

01:33:49.457 --> 01:33:50.591
WE ARE PRODUCING IT IS THE

01:33:50.658 --> 01:33:51.859
KNOWLEDGE I WANT TO BRING SO I

01:33:51.926 --> 01:33:53.494
CAN COME BACK TO THIS BILL.

01:33:53.561 --> 01:33:55.262
WE'RE OVER PRODUCING SOLAR

01:33:55.329 --> 01:33:56.864
ENERGY IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW

01:33:56.931 --> 01:33:58.766
AND WE'RE STILL INCENTIVIZE IT

01:33:58.833 --> 01:33:59.266
WERE STILL PUSHING THAT

01:33:59.333 --> 01:33:59.567
[inaudible]

01:33:59.633 --> 01:34:01.435
FORWARD.

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:02.803
AND SO THE OUR LEADER BUT OUR

01:34:02.870 --> 01:34:05.106
COST OF ENERGY IS HIGHER THAN

01:34:05.172 --> 01:34:06.741
MOST ANY PLACE IN THE NATION.

01:34:06.807 --> 01:34:08.976
SO I THINK WE SHOULD INCENTIVIZE

01:34:09.043 --> 01:34:10.978
BUT ALSO HEARD THE OPPOSITION

01:34:11.045 --> 01:34:13.014
WHO JUST SAID HATE LIST THUS

01:34:13.080 --> 01:34:14.915
THUS DO THIS THE RIGHT WAY THE

01:34:14.982 --> 01:34:16.517
RIGHT WAY IS NOT FORED INTO A

01:34:16.584 --> 01:34:18.352
GOAL THAT IS VERY HARD FOR THEM

01:34:18.419 --> 01:34:19.253
TO MEET.

01:34:19.320 --> 01:34:20.121
SO THAT WE PUSH IT OUT OF

01:34:20.187 --> 01:34:22.056
CALIFORNIA AND WE DON'T ACTUALLY

01:34:22.123 --> 01:34:23.324
DO WHAT WE WANT TO DO IF WE WANT

01:34:23.391 --> 01:34:24.658
TO BE A LEADER IN THE WORLD.

01:34:24.725 --> 01:34:27.461
WE HAVE TO BRING INDUSTRY ALONG

01:34:27.528 --> 01:34:28.195
WITH THIS.

01:34:28.262 --> 01:34:30.031
TO MAKE THAT HAPPEN SO I HEARD

01:34:30.097 --> 01:34:31.899
FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT THEY

01:34:31.966 --> 01:34:33.868
WOULD DON'T WANT THAT THAT IT'S

01:34:33.934 --> 01:34:35.669
ABOUT A PERCENTAGE SO LET'S TRY

01:34:35.736 --> 01:34:36.937
TO GET TO THAT PERCENTAGE WHERE

01:34:37.004 --> 01:34:38.205
THEY'RE COMFORTABLE WITH IT.

01:34:38.272 --> 01:34:39.373
AND I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT

01:34:39.440 --> 01:34:40.975
THIS SO THAT WE ACTUALLY CAN'T

01:34:41.042 --> 01:34:42.443
DO THE RIGHT THING AND LEAD --

01:34:42.510 --> 01:34:46.247
AND SHOW BY EXAMPLE TO THE REST

01:34:46.313 --> 01:34:47.715
OF YOU KNOW.

01:34:47.782 --> 01:34:49.583
PEOPLE WHO ARE HER NOT DOING

01:34:49.650 --> 01:34:51.986
THIS OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA.

01:34:52.053 --> 01:34:54.555
SO IF WE CAN PUT THAT LOU AND

01:34:54.622 --> 01:34:56.123
CLOSE THAT LOOP -- AND ACTUALLY

01:34:56.190 --> 01:34:58.025
DO IT IN A WAY WHERE WE DON'T

01:34:58.092 --> 01:34:59.860
PUSH BUSINESS OUT OF CALIFORNIA

01:34:59.927 --> 01:35:01.295
ANY WE I HAVE BOTTLERS IN MY

01:35:01.362 --> 01:35:02.329
DISTRICT THAT ARE OPPOSE THIS

01:35:02.396 --> 01:35:04.065
PIECE OF LEGISLATION BECAUSE OF

01:35:04.131 --> 01:35:06.067
THE PERCENTAGE IN THIS BILL.

01:35:06.133 --> 01:35:09.437
SO ARE YOU WILLING -- TO LOOK AT

01:35:09.503 --> 01:35:10.905
THAT NUMBER AND GET IT TERM

01:35:10.971 --> 01:35:12.139
SOMEPLACE WHERE THEY CAN CAN'T

01:35:12.206 --> 01:35:13.641
COME ON AND SAY HEY LOOK WITH US

01:35:13.707 --> 01:35:14.642
DO THIS AND ARE SPREAD OUT OVER

01:35:14.708 --> 01:35:15.876
TIME SO THAT WE DON'T.

01:35:15.943 --> 01:35:16.877
PUSH THAT INDUSTRY OUT OF

01:35:16.944 --> 01:35:19.713
CALIFORNIA OR DRIVE THE COST UP

01:35:19.780 --> 01:35:21.382
TO WHERE IT IS COULD NOT CAN

01:35:21.449 --> 01:35:24.085
ACTUALLY BE A PRODUCTIVE.

01:35:24.151 --> 01:35:26.087
AND AND MEET THE GOAL.

01:35:26.153 --> 01:35:28.422
NO I I JUST WANNA MAKE UP FIRST

01:35:28.489 --> 01:35:30.524
I APPRECIATE -- THE SKINNER AND

01:35:30.591 --> 01:35:31.859
ARE KIND OF HER A HISTORIC

01:35:31.926 --> 01:35:33.060
PERSPECTIVE I JUST WANT TO MAKE

01:35:33.127 --> 01:35:34.762
THE POINT THAT EVERYBODY THAT

01:35:34.829 --> 01:35:36.564
WAS SITTING UP HERE WAS OPPOSE

01:35:36.630 --> 01:35:39.033
UNLESS AMENDED AND WE HAVE BEEN.

01:35:39.100 --> 01:35:40.768
HAVING VERY GOOD NEGOTIATIONS

01:35:40.835 --> 01:35:43.537
WITH THEM THEY ARE IN FAVOR OF

01:35:43.604 --> 01:35:44.939
THE MANDATE WE ARE JUST WORKING

01:35:45.005 --> 01:35:46.807
WITH THE NUMBERS TO MAKE SURE

01:35:46.874 --> 01:35:48.042
THAT WE CAN.

01:35:48.109 --> 01:35:50.010
COME TO SOME SORT OF NUMBER THAT

01:35:50.077 --> 01:35:51.712
PUSHES THEM A LITTLE BIT BUT

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:53.581
THAT THEY CAN AGREE WITH ALAN --

01:35:53.647 --> 01:35:54.448
TO WE'VE DONE A LOT OF WORK SO

01:35:54.515 --> 01:35:56.550
FAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT

01:35:56.617 --> 01:35:57.551
WORK BECAUSE IT'S VERY IMPORTANT

01:35:57.618 --> 01:35:59.453
THAT THIS -- THAT WERE ABLE TO

01:35:59.520 --> 01:36:05.626
ACHIEVE THIS AND CLOSE THE LOOP.

01:36:05.693 --> 01:36:08.195
THIRD I ACTUALLY I THINK WE WANT

01:36:08.262 --> 01:36:09.196
TO HELP SO -- HAPPY TO WORK WITH

01:36:09.263 --> 01:36:09.797
AND WHICH IS FOR EXAMPLE THE

01:36:09.864 --> 01:36:10.297
INITIAL OFFER FROM THE

01:36:10.364 --> 01:36:12.867
OPPOSITION WAS 25% BY.

01:36:12.933 --> 01:36:13.434
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE YOU HEARD

01:36:13.501 --> 01:36:15.936
OPPOSITION FROM NIAGARA NIAGARA

01:36:16.003 --> 01:36:19.640
TODAY TODAY NOT TOMORROW TODAY'S

01:36:19.707 --> 01:36:21.442
ALREADY AT 40%.

01:36:21.509 --> 01:36:23.511
NESTLE IS AT 37% AND THOSE ARE

01:36:23.577 --> 01:36:25.779
THE TWO LARGEST BOTTLED WATER

01:36:25.846 --> 01:36:27.681
COMPANIES IN THE STATE.

01:36:27.748 --> 01:36:29.950
ALSO IN ADDITION 50% OF OUR PET

01:36:30.017 --> 01:36:31.719
IS GOING OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA

01:36:31.785 --> 01:36:33.120
SO WE WE ABSOLUTELY.

01:36:33.187 --> 01:36:36.090
AGAIN THE RICHES OF ONE OF THE

01:36:36.157 --> 01:36:38.325
OF THE PLASTICS IS OUTSIDE OF

01:36:38.392 --> 01:36:39.693
CALIFORNIA SO AGAIN WE WOULD

01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:41.428
LIKE TO BE THE SINGLE WE WANT TO

01:36:41.495 --> 01:36:41.862
KEEP IN CALIFORNIA.

01:36:41.929 --> 01:36:43.764
WE WANT A REALISTIC PERCENTAGE

01:36:43.831 --> 01:36:45.232
BUT IT'S ODD WHEN.

01:36:45.299 --> 01:36:47.034
YOU AGAIN YOU HAVE THE TWO

01:36:47.101 --> 01:36:47.902
LARGEST.

01:36:47.968 --> 01:36:48.836
BOTTLE WATER MANUFACTURES

01:36:48.903 --> 01:36:51.472
ALREADY WELL ABOVE THE 25%

01:36:51.539 --> 01:36:52.239
SAYING.

01:36:52.306 --> 01:36:54.108

TILL TWENTY TWENTY FIVE NOW ONE

01:36:55.276 --> 01:36:57.711
OF THE REASONS IS THERE'S A

01:36:57.778 --> 01:37:00.447
LIMITED SUPPLY THAT'S RIGHT SO

01:37:00.514 --> 01:37:07.555

01:37:11.859 --> 01:37:12.760
ABSOLUTELY.

01:37:12.826 --> 01:37:13.527
I THINK THERE ARE SOME CONCERNS

01:37:13.594 --> 01:37:14.528
AS SOME OF THE RECYCLE PLASTIC

01:37:14.595 --> 01:37:16.030

01:37:16.931 --> 01:37:18.265
I THINK WE'RE ALL VERY VERY OPEN

01:37:18.332 --> 01:37:19.800
TO THAT -- BUT WE ALSO BELIEVE

01:37:19.867 --> 01:37:22.536

RECYCLED PLASTIC THERE HASN'T

01:37:40.154 --> 01:37:42.556
BEEN AS MUCH A MARKET BECAUSE OF

01:37:42.623 --> 01:37:42.856
THE PRICING.

01:37:42.923 --> 01:37:43.924

MAKES SENSE BUT WE ALSO DON'T

01:38:14.121 --> 01:38:15.556
WANT TO BE TAKEN.

01:38:15.623 --> 01:38:17.958

THE VET SUPPLIES OUT THERE AND

01:38:26.333 --> 01:38:28.435
IT'S DRIVES THE PRICE THAT WE

01:38:28.502 --> 01:38:29.470
SAW THAT WHEN THE BIOMASS

01:38:29.536 --> 01:38:31.639
INDUSTRY JUST LAST TWO YEARS AND

01:38:31.705 --> 01:38:33.907
WE FORCED THEM TO TAKE A CERTAIN.

01:38:33.974 --> 01:38:35.309
PERCENTAGE AND THEN THEY'RE ALL

01:38:35.376 --> 01:38:36.410
COMPETING FOR THAT CERTAIN

01:38:36.477 --> 01:38:37.278
PERCENTAGE WHEN THERE'S OTHERS

01:38:37.344 --> 01:38:39.780
OF OTHER VEHICLE SO IT HAS TO BE

01:38:39.847 --> 01:38:40.714
BALANCED AND I KNOW YOU'RE MADE

01:38:40.781 --> 01:38:43.584
SO I I WANT THIS TO WORK.

01:38:43.651 --> 01:38:44.652
AYE AYE AYE BUT WE'VE GOT A IT'S

01:38:44.718 --> 01:38:46.553
GOT TO WORK SO THAT WE DON'T

01:38:46.620 --> 01:38:48.022
DRIVE THEM OUT OF CALIFORNIA.

01:38:48.088 --> 01:38:49.757
AND WE KEEP THOSE HERE WE

01:38:49.823 --> 01:38:51.458
ACTUALLY OUR MODEL FOR THE ORLD.

01:38:51.525 --> 01:38:52.359
TOTALLY GREEN I THINK ONE OF THE

01:38:52.426 --> 01:38:53.294
WAYS THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING AT

01:38:53.360 --> 01:38:55.029
THE OFFRAMP THAT WE DESIGNED

01:38:55.095 --> 01:38:56.530
475% BUT WE COULD DO IT FOR FOR

01:38:56.597 --> 01:38:57.598
THE LOWER PERCENTAGES.

01:38:57.665 --> 01:38:59.433
IS REALLY HAVE SORT OF CAL

01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:01.302
RECYCLE BE ABLE TO FLIP THAT

01:39:01.368 --> 01:39:02.236
SWITCH ON AND OFF SINCE IF YOU

01:39:02.303 --> 01:39:03.504
REALLY DO HAVE.

01:39:03.570 --> 01:39:04.738
A SUPPLY ISSUE THAT WE'RE

01:39:04.805 --> 01:39:06.206

YOU KNOW WORKABLE GONNA FLIP IT

01:39:10.678 --> 01:39:12.112
OFF SO I THINK THAT THAT'S

01:39:12.179 --> 01:39:13.981
SOMETHING THAT WERE WE ARE OPEN.

01:39:14.048 --> 01:39:15.382
TO NEGOTIATING SO THAT THE

01:39:15.449 --> 01:39:16.717
SOMEONE IS MONITORING I THINK IT

01:39:16.784 --> 01:39:17.985
IS.

01:39:18.052 --> 01:39:19.586
DIFFICULT WHEN YOU'RE TALKING

01:39:19.653 --> 01:39:21.455

THE RIGHT PERCENTAGE WHICH IS

01:39:24.725 --> 01:39:31.498
WHY I THINK IT DOES MAKE SENSE

01:39:31.565 --> 01:39:33.634
TO HAVE AN OFFER.

01:39:33.701 --> 01:39:34.635

THIS POINT.

01:39:40.607 --> 01:39:41.675
THE WAY WE HAD ENVISIONED THE

01:39:41.742 --> 01:39:43.410
75% OFF RAMP WAS BY CAL RECYCLE

01:39:43.477 --> 01:39:46.380

01:55:01.060 --> 01:55:02.595
WE'RE GOING TO NEED TO HAVE OR

01:55:02.662 --> 01:55:04.130
WE THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED THIS

01:55:04.197 --> 01:55:05.632
REBATE.

01:55:05.698 --> 01:55:07.834
AT THAT SEVENTY FIVE HUNDRED LET

01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:08.835
ALL THE CONSUMERS SO AS THE

01:55:08.901 --> 01:55:09.969
STAFF REPORT PART PARTS THAT DO

01:55:10.036 --> 01:55:13.640
A BETTER JOB A DAD.

01:55:13.706 --> 01:55:15.775
INTO WILL SOME OTHER TRIGGER.

01:55:15.842 --> 01:55:17.076
OCCURS THAT WE READ WE PASS

01:55:17.143 --> 01:55:18.378
MILLION TO WHATEVER IT IS AND

01:55:18.444 --> 01:55:19.946
THEN THAT REBATE WOULD BE

01:55:20.013 --> 01:55:21.581
ADJUSTED.

01:55:21.648 --> 01:55:23.016
UNTIL LATE SOME POINT IN TWENTY

01:55:23.082 --> 01:55:26.519
THIRTY WERE IT. ONE ZERO THE

01:55:26.586 --> 01:55:28.454
JUSTICE ZERO IS THAT IS THAT

01:55:28.521 --> 01:55:30.189
THAT THAT THE ONLY IDEA

01:55:30.256 --> 01:55:30.490
ABSOLUTELY.

01:55:30.556 --> 01:55:31.958
ABSOLUTELY.

01:55:32.025 --> 01:55:33.493
GOOD AND THEY AN IDEA THAT YOU

01:55:33.559 --> 01:55:35.828
NEED TO SECURITIZED AS WE SAY --

01:55:35.895 --> 01:55:36.963
WE DON'T BELIEVE IT'S

01:55:37.030 --> 01:55:37.764
APPROPRIATE ALSO JUST SAY HEY WE

01:55:37.830 --> 01:55:39.132
WANT TO TAKE ALL THIS MONEY OUT

01:55:39.198 --> 01:55:40.166
OF GREENHOUSE GAS REDUCTION FROM

01:55:40.233 --> 01:55:41.267
BECAUSE THAT ACTUALLY.

01:55:41.334 --> 01:55:42.068
WOULD REDUCE ALL THE OTHER

01:55:42.135 --> 01:55:43.536
PRIVATE SO WE THINK THIS IS A

01:55:43.603 --> 01:55:45.672
MORE RESPONSIBLE WAY TO GO -- IN

01:55:45.738 --> 01:55:47.707
THE IN AROUND SO THAT WE COULD

01:55:47.774 --> 01:55:49.609
GET THE MONEY UP FRONT BUT THEN

01:55:49.676 --> 01:55:50.476
PAY IT BACK OVER TIME SO.

01:55:50.543 --> 01:55:53.546
ANOTHER WAY TO LOOKING AND IS

01:55:53.613 --> 01:55:54.681
THERE IS A POP.

01:55:54.747 --> 01:55:55.615
AN AMOUNT THAT ALLOCATED FROM

01:55:55.682 --> 01:55:56.416
THE GREENHOUSE GAS FUND THIS

01:55:56.482 --> 01:55:59.218
COULD BE AN AUGMENTATION.

01:55:59.285 --> 01:56:00.186
TWO TO ONE ASSURE THE PUBLIC

01:56:00.253 --> 01:56:01.187
THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RUN OUT

01:56:01.254 --> 01:56:04.057
OF REBATES AT SOMETIME IN APRIL

01:56:04.123 --> 01:56:05.024
OR SEPTEMBER WHEREVER WHEREVER

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:07.093
HIS AND AND ALSO POSSIBLY.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.628
RESTORE BECAUSE AS THE FEDERAL

01:56:08.695 --> 01:56:10.797
LEVEL GOES DOWN THAT WOULD ALLOW

01:56:10.863 --> 01:56:13.766
THAT BACK FILLING IS AT THE THE

01:56:13.833 --> 01:56:14.967
THRILLS AND THAT'S WHAT THE

01:56:15.034 --> 01:56:16.536
MAJOR CONCERNS IN MY WE WANTED

01:56:16.602 --> 01:56:17.236
TO DO THIS.

01:56:17.303 --> 01:56:18.304
YES WITH TESLA AND GENERAL

01:56:18.371 --> 01:56:20.306
MOTORS THE TWO MOST POPULAR

01:56:20.373 --> 01:56:23.843
SELLERS OF THEM IN CALIFORNIA.

01:56:23.910 --> 01:56:26.145
THE BECAUSE OF THE THE VOLUME

01:56:26.212 --> 01:56:28.514
THAT THEY SOLD WHICH IS A GOOD.

01:56:28.581 --> 01:56:31.551
TO THE GOOD NEWS ON THAT THEY

01:56:31.617 --> 01:56:32.685
HAVE NOW GONE THE CUT IN THE

01:56:32.752 --> 01:56:35.288
FEDERAL TAX CREDIT SO NOW IF YOU

01:56:35.355 --> 01:56:37.357
WANT TO GO BY TESLA OR CHEVY

01:56:37.423 --> 01:56:37.557
BOLT.

01:56:37.623 --> 01:56:38.458
YOU DON'T GET THE SAME AMOUNT OF

01:56:38.524 --> 01:56:40.793
TAX CREDIT IF YOU WANT TO GO BUY

01:56:40.860 --> 01:56:41.194
SOME OF THE CAR.

01:56:41.260 --> 01:56:41.794
AND THERE WAS SOME CRITICISM

01:56:41.861 --> 01:56:43.029
ABOUT THIS.

01:56:43.096 --> 01:56:45.098
BEING DUPLICATIVE OF THE ONE

01:56:45.164 --> 01:56:48.000
POINT FIVE MILLION THAT WAS HAND

01:56:48.067 --> 01:56:50.536
MONDAYS BUDGET -- THAT IS TO CUT

01:56:50.603 --> 01:56:51.270
ITS STYLE COMPLETELY DIFFERENT

01:56:51.337 --> 01:56:52.405
THAT STUDY IS ABOUT A MUCH MORE

01:56:52.472 --> 01:56:53.306
HOLISTIC STUDY ON HOW YOU COULD

01:56:53.373 --> 01:56:54.974
TO CLEAN CARS BY.

01:56:55.041 --> 01:56:55.541
TWENTY FORTY WHICH INCLUDES

01:56:55.608 --> 01:56:56.776
CHARGING INFRASTRUCTURE A WHOLE

01:56:56.843 --> 01:56:58.678
VARIETY OF FACTORS THIS IS VERY

01:56:58.745 --> 01:57:00.279
VERY NARAL.

01:57:00.346 --> 01:57:07.053
ONLY LOOKING AT THE CLEAN

01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:07.787
VEHICLE REBATE PROGRAM

01:57:07.854 --> 01:57:08.087
[inaudible]

01:57:08.154 --> 01:57:10.590
THANK YOU.

01:57:10.656 --> 01:57:11.324
AND I FORGOT TO LEAD OFF BY

01:57:11.391 --> 01:57:12.925
SAYING WE'RE REALLY HAPPY WITH

01:57:12.992 --> 01:57:13.493
THE COMMITMENTS AND HAPPY TO

01:57:13.559 --> 01:57:16.429
TAKE.

01:57:16.496 --> 01:57:18.564
OKAY -- I MEAN THE COURSE THE

01:57:18.631 --> 01:57:19.132
BIG QUESTION IS WHERE IS THE

01:57:19.198 --> 01:57:22.101
MONEY.

01:57:22.168 --> 01:57:27.106
IT'S GONNA WATER BOWL.

01:57:27.173 --> 01:57:29.075
THAT WATER UNDER THE WATER YEAH

01:57:29.142 --> 01:57:31.244
THAT IS ALWAYS THE BIG QUESTION

01:57:31.310 --> 01:57:32.812
IS WHERE THE MONEY'S COMING FROM

01:57:32.879 --> 01:57:34.313
SO THAT THAT' WHY WE DIFFERENT

01:57:34.380 --> 01:57:35.782
P. GINNY THAT'S A THAT'S A

01:57:35.848 --> 01:57:39.619
POSSIBILITY OKAY NOT A BAD IDEA

01:57:39.685 --> 01:57:41.454
SENATE SKINNER -- ASSEMBLY

01:57:41.521 --> 01:57:42.522
MEMBER I WANT TO THANK YOU ONCE

01:57:42.588 --> 01:57:43.723
AGAIN FOR FOCUSING ON MARKETS

01:57:43.790 --> 01:57:46.359
AND ECONOMIC SIGNALS BECAUSE I'M

01:57:46.426 --> 01:57:47.393
IN OUR CALIFORNIA SOME OF OUR

01:57:47.460 --> 01:57:47.794
MOST SUCCESSFUL.

01:57:47.860 --> 01:57:48.828
PROGRAMS THAT HAVE EITHER HELP

01:57:48.895 --> 01:57:49.896
DESK CLEAN NEAR.

01:57:49.962 --> 01:57:52.298
OR REDUCE WASTE OR ANY NUMBER OF

01:57:52.365 --> 01:57:54.267
OTHER THINGS THIS BAND BECAUSE

01:57:54.333 --> 01:57:56.869
WE GOT OUR MARKET SIGNALS RIGHT

01:57:56.936 --> 01:57:57.170
[inaudible]

01:57:57.236 --> 01:58:01.674
AND WE GOTTA GET OUR MARKET

01:58:01.741 --> 01:58:02.942
SIGNALS RIGHT ON THIS ONE

01:58:03.009 --> 01:58:07.180
BECAUSE TRANSPORTATION IS STILL

01:58:07.246 --> 01:58:09.482
TAILPIPE EMISSIONS.

01:58:09.549 --> 01:58:10.950
ARE THE NUMBER ONE SOURCE

01:58:11.017 --> 01:58:11.250
[inaudible]

01:58:11.317 --> 01:58:14.954
OF OUR EMISSIONS THAT CREATE

01:58:15.021 --> 01:58:16.289
THAT ARE CONTRIBUTING TO CLIMATE

01:58:16.355 --> 01:58:17.890
CHAOS.

01:58:17.957 --> 01:58:19.091
BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY I THINK IN

01:58:19.158 --> 01:58:20.526
I SEE MORE IMPORTANTLY NOT

01:58:20.593 --> 01:58:23.362
BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CRISIS ISN'T

01:58:23.429 --> 01:58:25.131
JUST VERY VERY REAL.

01:58:25.198 --> 01:58:28.367
BUT PEOPLE CALIFORNIANS ARE MORE

01:58:28.434 --> 01:58:30.570
DIRECTLY AFFECTED.

01:58:30.636 --> 01:58:31.571
MAYBE NOT.

01:58:31.637 --> 01:58:32.572
A DIFFERENT WAY BECAUSE FIRES

01:58:32.638 --> 01:58:34.106
ARE PRETTY BAD BUT YOU'VE GOT

01:58:34.173 --> 01:58:36.609
MANY MANY MORE PEOPLE IN

01:58:36.676 --> 01:58:37.844
CALIFORNIA.

01:58:37.910 --> 01:58:39.679
GETTING CHRONIC ASTHMA.

01:58:39.745 --> 01:58:41.647
THAT IS FROM AIR POLLUTION WE

01:58:41.714 --> 01:58:44.383
STILL HAVE OUT OF THE TEN MOST

01:58:44.450 --> 01:58:46.986
POLLUTED CITIES IN THE US.

01:58:47.053 --> 01:58:47.954
CALIFORNIA'S GOT SEVEN OR EIGHT

01:58:48.020 --> 01:58:49.789
OF THEM.

01:58:49.856 --> 01:58:51.524
AND IT'S PRIMARILY TAIL PIPE

01:58:51.591 --> 01:58:54.961
POLLUTION SO UNTIL WE GET TO THE

01:58:55.027 --> 01:58:55.928
TYPE OF GOALS THAT WE HAVE

01:58:55.995 --> 01:58:57.663
ALREADY SET HERE THERE AND

01:58:57.730 --> 01:58:59.432
EVERYWHERE AROUND ZERO EMISSION

01:58:59.499 --> 01:59:00.700
VEHICLES ARE CLEAN.

01:59:00.766 --> 01:59:02.201
VEHICLES WE'RE NOT GOING TO

01:59:02.268 --> 01:59:04.237
CLEAN OUR AIR AND WE'RE NOT

01:59:04.303 --> 01:59:04.837
GOING TO DEAL WITH THE CLIMATE

01:59:04.904 --> 01:59:05.505
CRISIS.

01:59:05.571 --> 01:59:09.075
AND WHILE I WOULD LIKE TO SEE A

01:59:09.141 --> 01:59:10.710
FAR GREATER AMOUNT OF OUR

01:59:10.776 --> 01:59:12.078
GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS

01:59:12.144 --> 01:59:14.046
REDUCTION FINDER GIGI ERA FIND

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:15.314
TO BE.

01:59:15.381 --> 01:59:16.916
DIRECTED TOWARDS THIS HUGE

01:59:16.983 --> 01:59:19.719
SECTOR OF GHG EMISSIONS AND

01:59:19.785 --> 01:59:21.420
CONTINUALLY APPROPRIATED.

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:23.422
I THINK YOUR APPROACH IS

01:59:23.489 --> 01:59:25.391
APPROPRIATE BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT

01:59:25.458 --> 01:59:27.193
TYING IT TO A PARTICULAR FUND

01:59:27.260 --> 01:59:29.295
SOURCE SO THAT WE STILL HAVE THE

01:59:29.362 --> 01:59:30.630
ABILITY.

01:59:30.696 --> 01:59:31.731
TO ARGUE HERE IN THERE EVEN

01:59:31.797 --> 01:59:32.999
THOUGH I WILL STILL MAKE THE

01:59:33.065 --> 01:59:35.801
CASE FOR A HIGHER PERCENT OF G.

01:59:35.868 --> 01:59:37.270
G. R. F. CONTINUOUSLY

01:59:37.336 --> 01:59:39.272
APPROPRIATED TO GET CLEAN

01:59:39.338 --> 01:59:40.706
VEHICLES BUT ANYWAY.

01:59:40.773 --> 01:59:42.708
BUT THIS BILL IS VERY IMPORTANT

01:59:42.775 --> 01:59:44.977
BECAUSE IN THE SAME WAY THAT WE

01:59:45.044 --> 01:59:46.445
GOT THE PRICE OF ROOFTOP SOLAR

01:59:46.512 --> 01:59:49.415
DOWN IN NOT JUST ROOFTOP SOLAR.

01:59:49.482 --> 01:59:50.283
FOR THOSE OF YOU WHO MAY NOT

01:59:50.349 --> 01:59:51.717
LIKE ROOFTOP SOLAR BUT THE

01:59:51.784 --> 01:59:53.219
BRINGING OF THAT PRICE DOWN

01:59:53.286 --> 01:59:54.887
BROUGHT DOWN THE PRICE OF ALL

01:59:54.954 --> 01:59:56.522
SOLAR PEAVEY WHICH BROUGHT DOWN.

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:58.357
THE KILOWATT HOUR RENEWABLE

01:59:58.424 --> 02:00:00.259
GENERATION PRICE WHICH IS MADE

02:00:00.326 --> 02:00:02.795
UP WHY WE CAN HAVE -- BUT THE

02:00:02.862 --> 02:00:04.697
AMOUNT OF RENEWABLE GENERATION

02:00:04.764 --> 02:00:07.033
NOW IN THE STATE WITHOUT THE

02:00:07.099 --> 02:00:08.067
HUGE PRICES.

02:00:08.134 --> 02:00:09.035
SO WE HAVE TO DO THE SAME THING.

02:00:09.101 --> 02:00:10.636
NOW.

02:00:10.703 --> 02:00:12.471
YOUR BILL DOES THAT IT'S ON THE

02:00:12.538 --> 02:00:15.441
RIGHT MODEL -- IT'S NOT BEFORE

02:00:15.508 --> 02:00:16.943
US TODAY BUT I WOULD LIKE TO

02:00:17.009 --> 02:00:19.011
HAVE -- MEDIUM AND HEAVY DUTY

02:00:19.078 --> 02:00:21.013
VEHICLES IN THIS ALSO BECAUSE

02:00:21.080 --> 02:00:22.782
FROM AN AIR POLLUTION POINT OF

02:00:22.848 --> 02:00:24.050
VIEW THERE EVEN A MORE

02:00:24.116 --> 02:00:26.018
SIGNIFICANT.

02:00:26.085 --> 02:00:27.653
SO IF WE'RE THAT WE SHOULD

02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:29.622
INLUDE THAT BUT THAT'S OKAY

02:00:29.689 --> 02:00:31.991
RIGHT NOW THIS IS AROUND THE

02:00:32.058 --> 02:00:35.595
PASSENGER VEHICLES -- SOME POINT

02:00:35.661 --> 02:00:36.862
WILL EXPAND IT.

02:00:36.929 --> 02:00:38.564
I BUT I THINK IT'S REALLY THE

02:00:38.631 --> 02:00:41.033
RIGHT DIRECTION BUT I ALSO.

02:00:41.100 --> 02:00:43.569
DO HOPE THAT -- AND I KNOW YOU

02:00:43.636 --> 02:00:45.338
ARE WORKING WITH THEM THAT WE

02:00:45.404 --> 02:00:47.807
WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ART

02:00:47.873 --> 02:00:50.476
DEALERS CAR DEALERS AND OUR MAN

02:00:50.543 --> 02:00:52.945
YOU ARE AUTO MANUFACTURERS.

02:00:53.012 --> 02:00:54.447
THAT JUST LIKE THE PREVIOUS BILL

02:00:54.513 --> 02:00:56.048
THAT WE HAVE THE RIGHT SWEET

02:00:56.115 --> 02:00:58.884
SPOTS SO THIS REALLY DOES.

02:00:58.951 --> 02:01:00.987
ACHIEVE WHAT WE HAVE IN MIND THE

02:01:01.053 --> 02:01:02.455
MARKET SIGNAL THAT YOU'RE

02:01:02.521 --> 02:01:05.224
DESIGNING HERE REALLY DOES HE

02:01:05.291 --> 02:01:06.559
KEEP IT AND WE DON'T HAVE.

02:01:06.626 --> 02:01:07.393
YOU KNOW AND I KNOW THE

02:01:07.460 --> 02:01:09.028
SOMETIMES WE HAVE TO PRACTICE IT

02:01:09.095 --> 02:01:10.162
BEFORE WE'RE GOING TO REALLY

02:01:10.229 --> 02:01:12.264
UNDERSTAND IT BUT I APPRECIATE.

02:01:12.331 --> 02:01:14.033
YOUR COMMITMENT TO WORK WITH THE

02:01:14.100 --> 02:01:15.935
FOLKS WHO ARE EITHER IN

02:01:16.002 --> 02:01:17.770
OPPOSITION OR TWO WINNERS -- AND

02:01:17.837 --> 02:01:22.942
WITH THAT I WOULD MOVE THE BILL.

02:01:23.009 --> 02:01:25.177
RIGHT THIS QUESTIONS BUT THE

02:01:25.244 --> 02:01:27.380
MOVE -- TO FEW LIKE CLOSE TO

02:01:27.446 --> 02:01:28.247
JUST THREE QUICK POINT ON ON THE

02:01:28.314 --> 02:01:28.881
FEE BASED ISSUE ABSOLUTE THIS

02:01:28.948 --> 02:01:30.282
THIS BILL WAS NOT INTENDED TO

02:01:30.349 --> 02:01:32.284
USE FEE BAIT AS A FUNDING STREAM

02:01:32.351 --> 02:01:34.453
SO I ACTUALLY HAVE COMMITTED. TO

GOING TO PLAN FOR DEVELOPMENT.

02:06:13.165 --> 02:06:14.733

02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:16.802
DEFINITION OF CONSULTATION IN

INDIAN -- FAXED OVER AREAS AND

02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:10.509
ALSO THERE'S DOESN'T SEEM TO BE

02:09:10.576 --> 02:09:12.044
IN THE KNOWLEDGE MEANT THAT THE

02:09:12.111 --> 02:09:14.413

THE PUBLIC AND THE PUBLIC

02:09:18.250 --> 02:09:19.184
BECAUSE WE KNOW A WETLAND WE

02:09:33.866 --> 02:09:36.135
THE THE CALIFORNIA -- TRIBE AND

02:09:36.201 --> 02:09:38.537
THEN IT SAYS IT IN AN IN

02:09:38.604 --> 02:09:40.806
ACCORDANCE WITH THESE ACTIONS TO

02:09:40.873 --> 02:09:43.142
AVOID OR MINIMIZE THE IMPACTS

02:09:43.208 --> 02:09:44.276
AND THAT MAY BE.

02:09:44.343 --> 02:09:45.744
BUT THAT'S A DIFFERENT PROCESS

02:09:45.811 --> 02:09:48.046
BECAUSE MINISTERIALIS BEHIND

02:09:48.113 --> 02:09:49.414

WHAT IT MAY BE.

02:09:57.055 --> 02:09:59.391

POSSIBLE INFILL SITE NEEDS TO BE

02:10:08.066 --> 02:10:10.269

SB THIRTY FIVE IN THIS COMMITTEE

02:10:12.104 --> 02:10:14.039

FORWARD OR WILL GET THEIR THEIR

02:10:34.126 --> 02:10:36.695
IDEA OF MINIMIZING IS DIFFERENT

02:10:36.762 --> 02:10:38.463
THEN WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN A

02:10:38.530 --> 02:10:39.097
SEQUEL.

COMMENTS THEY MIGHT.

02:10:46.805 --> 02:10:48.207

ABOUT I'M GOING TO HAVE MY

02:10:54.513 --> 02:10:55.681
WITNESS BECAUSE SHE WAS HERE

02:10:55.747 --> 02:10:57.616
WHEN THEY DID AB FIFTY TWO IN

02:10:57.683 --> 02:11:00.619
OTHERS AND THEY HAD COVER THAT

02:11:00.686 --> 02:11:01.553
DURING THE HOUSE OR DO YOU

02:11:01.620 --> 02:11:02.454
PREFER.

TO TO YET THANK YOU FOR THE

02:11:03.255 --> 02:11:04.556
QUESTION I MEAN YOUR TOUCH ON ON

02:11:04.623 --> 02:11:09.228
MOVE THE BILL I HAVE TO STEP OUT

02:11:09.294 --> 02:11:09.861
FOR IN IT SO I JUST WANT TO MOVE

02:11:09.928 --> 02:11:11.063
THE BILL.

02:11:11.129 --> 02:11:11.697
ARE YOU TOUCHED UPON YOU KNOW

02:11:11.763 --> 02:11:12.331
THAT'S REALLY THE THE NOT THEY

02:11:12.397 --> 02:11:12.864
WERE TRYING TO CRACK HERE

02:11:12.931 --> 02:11:14.533
BECAUSE THE THE SB THIRTY FIVE

02:11:14.600 --> 02:11:15.801
PROCESS DID DELINEATE CERTAIN

02:11:15.867 --> 02:11:17.536
EXEMPTIONS FROM STREAMLINING.

02:11:17.603 --> 02:11:19.438
AND THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF THIS

02:11:19.504 --> 02:11:20.505
BILL INCLUDED TRAVEL CUTS

02:11:20.572 --> 02:11:23.041
CULTURAL RESOURCES AS DEFINED IN --

02:11:23.108 --> 02:11:24.610
THE PUBLIC RESOURCES CODE IN THE

02:11:24.676 --> 02:11:26.111
LIST OF EXCLUSIONS SO THAT IT

02:11:26.178 --> 02:11:27.479
WOULD NOT BE UNDER THE

02:11:27.546 --> 02:11:29.948
MINISTERIAL PROCESS -- THERE WAS

02:11:30.015 --> 02:11:32.017
CONCERN ABOUT THAT BY THE SB

02:11:32.084 --> 02:11:33.852
THIRTY FIVES AUTHOR -- AND SO

02:11:33.919 --> 02:11:35.087
WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO SORT

02:11:35.153 --> 02:11:37.089
THROUGH -- THE HOW THE MECHANICS

02:11:37.155 --> 02:11:40.259
OF THIS WILL WORK -- BECAUSE AB

02:11:40.325 --> 02:11:41.994
FIFTY TWO IS IN A SECRET PROCESS

02:11:42.060 --> 02:11:45.364
AND THAT IS NOT MINISTERIAL SO

02:11:45.430 --> 02:11:46.398
IT IS A DISCRETIONARY PROCESS

02:11:46.465 --> 02:11:47.933
THAT DOES TRIGGER YOU KNOW A LOT

02:11:48.000 --> 02:11:49.234
OF REMEDIES AND SO.

02:11:49.301 --> 02:11:50.535
WITH THE CULTURAL RESOURCE

02:11:50.602 --> 02:11:53.005
COMPONENT YOU'RE RIGHT THAT IS

02:11:53.071 --> 02:11:55.274
THE MECHANICAL PIECE THAT WE'RE

02:11:55.340 --> 02:11:57.309
WORKING THROUGH AND OF COURSE WE

02:11:57.376 --> 02:11:58.143
DO.

02:11:58.210 --> 02:11:59.678
WE MEANING THE TRIBES THAT THEN

02:11:59.745 --> 02:12:01.079
THE TRIBAL REPRESENTATIVES THAT

02:12:01.146 --> 02:12:02.447
I'VE BEEN IN CONTACT WITH WE ARE

02:12:02.514 --> 02:12:04.683
CONCERNED ABOUT WHAT WE WOULD

02:12:04.750 --> 02:12:05.984
CALL AN AB FIFTY TWO LIGHT.

02:12:06.051 --> 02:12:07.686
PROCESS THAT DOESN'T ADEQUATELY

02:12:07.753 --> 02:12:10.722
CONSIDER THE RESOURCE AT HAND --

02:12:10.789 --> 02:12:12.791
AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THE AB

02:12:12.858 --> 02:12:14.426
FIFTY TWO PROTECTIONS ARE BUILT

02:12:14.493 --> 02:12:15.894
INTO THIS LEGISLATION.

02:12:15.961 --> 02:12:17.863
AND HOW THE WORDING OF THAT

02:12:17.929 --> 02:12:19.831
LOOKS THAT'S WHAT WE'RE TRYING

02:12:19.898 --> 02:12:21.800
TO RESOLVE WHEN AN MISTER CHAIR

02:12:21.867 --> 02:12:23.201
I THINK THE STAFF ANALYSIS IS

02:12:23.268 --> 02:12:24.803
SPOT ON ABOUT TALKING ABOUT THE

02:12:24.870 --> 02:12:26.104
LACK OF LANGUAGE.

02:12:26.171 --> 02:12:29.708
IN THE IN THE SB THIRTY FIVE THE

02:12:29.775 --> 02:12:32.444
MINISTERIAL -- CONTEXT WHICH IS

02:12:32.511 --> 02:12:34.579
IT'S IT'S YOU GO INTO THIS

02:12:34.646 --> 02:12:36.648
CONSULTATION WITH THE JUST A BIG

02:12:36.715 --> 02:12:39.384
HOPE THAT -- THAT THE THE THE

02:12:39.451 --> 02:12:40.652
CITY MANAGER THAT YOU'RE DEALING

02:12:40.719 --> 02:12:42.988
WITH IS IS GOING TO BE SENSITIVE

02:12:43.055 --> 02:12:45.624
TO THE THE THE CONCERNS THAT THE

02:12:45.691 --> 02:12:46.892
TRIBES SPRING WHICH IS DIFFERENT

02:12:46.958 --> 02:12:53.065
FROM THE C. FOR PROCESS WHICH IS.

02:12:53.131 --> 02:12:53.965
FUNDAMENTALLY -- SPELLED OUT

02:12:54.032 --> 02:12:54.533
RIGHT AND WE YOU KNOW WE'VE

02:12:54.599 --> 02:12:56.668
SPENT MANY YEARS DEVELOPING V.

02:12:56.735 --> 02:12:58.370
SICKLE GUIDELINES AS THE

02:12:58.437 --> 02:13:00.339
HANDBOOK.

02:13:00.405 --> 02:13:01.540
THE P. R. OVER THE YEARS AB SO

02:13:01.606 --> 02:13:03.141
THERE'S A VERY WELL THE BOTTOM

02:13:03.208 --> 02:13:05.310
OF DEVELOPED BODY OF RULES

02:13:05.377 --> 02:13:07.245
REGULATIONS AND THERE'S BEEN A

02:13:07.312 --> 02:13:09.214
LOT OF TRAINING -- DONE TO FOR

02:13:09.281 --> 02:13:10.615
LOCAL GOVERNMENT SO THAT THEY

02:13:10.682 --> 02:13:11.483
WOULD BE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THESE

02:13:11.550 --> 02:13:15.253
PROVISIONS AND SO HAVING A ED

02:13:15.320 --> 02:13:17.289
MINISTERIAL PROCESS THAT DOES

02:13:17.356 --> 02:13:18.990
NOT INCLUDE ALL OF THAT BUNDLE

02:13:19.057 --> 02:13:21.360
OF PROCESS.

02:13:21.426 --> 02:13:24.029
WOULD BE VERY CONFUSING AND I AM

02:13:24.096 --> 02:13:25.564
ONE OF MY MY CONCERNS IS THAT

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:27.265
BECAUSE YOU'RE SEEING MORE AND

02:13:27.332 --> 02:13:29.368
MORE STREAMLINING BILLS THAT.

02:13:29.434 --> 02:13:30.736
THE LANGUAGE IN THIS BILL IS

02:13:30.802 --> 02:13:32.204
GOING TO BE PROBABLY REPLICATED

02:13:32.270 --> 02:13:33.672
ANOTHER STREAMLINING BILLS AND

02:13:33.739 --> 02:13:34.439
SO WE WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET

02:13:34.506 --> 02:13:35.907
IT RIGHT BUT WE WANT TO MAKE

02:13:35.974 --> 02:13:36.942
SURE WE GET IT DONE IN THIS

02:13:37.008 --> 02:13:39.711
SESSION BECAUSE WE WILL MISS

02:13:39.778 --> 02:13:41.279
TIME IN SITES COULD BE.

02:13:41.346 --> 02:13:43.014
IMPACTED IN THE INTERIM SO WE

02:13:43.081 --> 02:13:44.282
WOULD MEAN A WE DO FEEL A LOT OF

02:13:44.349 --> 02:13:47.419
PRESSURE TO GET THIS DONE RIGHT.

02:13:47.486 --> 02:13:48.320
THIS SESSION.

02:13:48.387 --> 02:13:50.956
BEFORE THE END OF THE SESSION

02:13:51.022 --> 02:13:52.224
MISTER CHAIR I WOULD JUST ONCE

02:13:52.290 --> 02:13:53.692
AGAIN I I MENTIONED ALREADY BUT

02:13:53.759 --> 02:13:56.795
POINT OUT THAT MANY THE SACRED

02:13:56.862 --> 02:13:58.029
SITES.

02:13:58.096 --> 02:13:59.765
DON'T WANNA WELL PUBLICIZED THAT

02:13:59.831 --> 02:14:00.665
THEY EXIST THERE'S THERE'S JUST

02:14:00.732 --> 02:14:01.466

THEIR TUCKED INTO THE COMMUNITY

02:14:02.901 --> 02:14:03.668
BUT THEY ARE TUCKED IN THE

02:14:03.735 --> 02:14:06.338
COMMUNITY AND THIS WHOLE --

02:14:06.405 --> 02:14:08.240
MINISTERIAL PROCESSES ANTITHESIS

02:14:08.306 --> 02:14:10.642
THAT THAT THAT AT LEAST WHAT IT

02:14:10.709 --> 02:14:12.277
WHAT IS LEFT OF THAT HAS BEEN

02:14:12.344 --> 02:14:14.413
PRESERVED AND I I'M CONCERNED

02:14:14.479 --> 02:14:16.381
ABOUT IT BUT I WILL BE

02:14:16.448 --> 02:14:17.816
SUPPORTING THE CHAIR'S

02:14:17.883 --> 02:14:18.917

POINT THAT --YOU KNOW THIS IS A

02:14:26.925 --> 02:14:28.193
BILL THAT IS FOCUSED AND

02:14:28.260 --> 02:14:29.728
TARGETED I THINK TOWARDS URBAN

02:14:29.795 --> 02:14:31.897
SETTINGS -- BUT URBAN SETTINGS

02:14:31.963 --> 02:14:33.832

THIS BILL DOES NOT SEEK FUNDING

02:34:36.600 --> 02:34:38.002
FROM THE BUDGET IN FACT THE BILL

02:34:38.068 --> 02:34:39.436
IS SILENT ON A FUNDING SOURCE

02:34:39.503 --> 02:34:40.804
HOWEVER SINCE THE PROGRAM TO BE

02:34:40.871 --> 02:34:42.039
PLACED IN A SAFE DRINKING WATER

02:34:42.106 --> 02:34:43.207
ACT.

02:34:43.273 --> 02:34:44.241
THE STATE WATER BOARD CAN FIND

02:34:44.308 --> 02:34:46.010
THIS PROGRAM USING FUNDS FROM

02:34:46.076 --> 02:34:47.544
THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACCOUNT

02:34:47.611 --> 02:34:49.113
WHICH IS LARGELY COMPRISED OF

02:34:49.179 --> 02:34:50.214
DRINKING WATER FEES.

02:34:50.280 --> 02:34:53.317
PAID BY ALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS.

02:34:53.384 --> 02:34:54.952
AQUA OBJECTS TO THIS FUNDING

02:34:55.019 --> 02:34:56.353
SOURCE FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.

02:34:56.420 --> 02:34:58.355
FIRST MANY OF THE FOUR HUNDRED

02:34:58.422 --> 02:34:59.423
FIFTY PUBLICWATER SYSTEMS THAT

02:34:59.490 --> 02:35:00.958
ARE REPRESENTS ALREADY PAY

02:35:01.025 --> 02:35:01.959
DISPROPORTIONATELY MORE IN

02:35:02.026 --> 02:35:03.360
DRINKING WATER FEES THAN SMALLER

02:35:03.427 --> 02:35:04.495
WATER SYSTEMS.

02:35:04.561 --> 02:35:06.196
SO IF THE STATE WATER BOARD

02:35:06.263 --> 02:35:07.998
INCREASING INCREASES RATES

02:35:08.065 --> 02:35:09.299
WITHOUT BRIEF PROVIDING

02:35:09.366 --> 02:35:10.634
RECIPROCAL BENEFIT IT BECOMES

02:35:10.701 --> 02:35:12.136
HARDER FOR OUR MEMBERS TO MEET

02:35:12.202 --> 02:35:14.438
THEIR MISSION OF PROVIDING SAFE

02:35:14.505 --> 02:35:15.739
AND RELIABLE DRINKING WATER.

02:35:15.806 --> 02:35:17.207
SECOND THIS PROGRAM WOULD COST

02:35:17.274 --> 02:35:18.842
THE STATE WATER BOARD ROUGHLY

02:35:18.909 --> 02:35:19.443
FOURTEEN MILLION DOLLARS

02:35:19.510 --> 02:35:22.246
ANNUALLY IF EVERY COUNTY IN THE

02:35:22.312 --> 02:35:24.081
STATE DECIDED TO PARTICIPATE.

02:35:24.148 --> 02:35:25.683
LAST FISCAL YEAR THE WATER BOARD

02:35:25.749 --> 02:35:27.184
COLLECTED TWENTY FIVE MILLION

02:35:27.251 --> 02:35:28.886
DOLLARS AND DRINKING WATER FEES.

02:35:28.952 --> 02:35:30.287
THIS MEANS THE WATER BOARD COULD

02:35:30.354 --> 02:35:32.856
BE REQUIRED TO COLLECTS 5260%

02:35:32.923 --> 02:35:34.491
AND ADDITIONAL REVENUE TO

02:35:34.558 --> 02:35:35.959
ADEQUATELY FUND THIS PROGRAM.

02:35:36.026 --> 02:35:37.594
AKA QUESTIONS HOW THE WATER

02:35:37.661 --> 02:35:38.595
BOARD COULD ACTUALLY FROM THIS

02:35:38.662 --> 02:35:40.364
PROGRAM AND REMAIN IN COMPLIANCE

02:35:40.431 --> 02:35:42.066

02:35:43.167 --> 02:35:44.735
CALIFORNIA CONSTITUTION.

02:35:44.802 --> 02:35:46.036
THESE CONSTITUTIONAL MANDATES

02:35:46.103 --> 02:35:48.305
THE MAN THAT REGULATORY FEES

02:35:48.372 --> 02:35:50.107
IMPOSED ON A LOCAL AGENCY DO NOT

02:35:50.174 --> 02:35:50.974
EXCEED THE RESULT IN

02:35:51.041 --> 02:35:52.776
PROPORTIONAL COST OF THE SERVICE

02:35:52.843 --> 02:35:54.411
PROVIDED BY THE STATE.

02:35:54.478 --> 02:35:55.813
OUR MEMBERS ARE NOT REGULATED BY

02:35:55.879 --> 02:35:57.481
L. P. A.'S THAT MEANS THE WATER

02:35:57.548 --> 02:35:58.615
BOARD COULD SUBSTANTIALLY

02:35:58.682 --> 02:36:00.551
INCREASE RATES ON PUBLIC WATER

02:36:00.617 --> 02:36:02.853
SYSTEMS WITHOUT RE PROVIDING ANY

02:36:02.920 --> 02:36:04.188
ADDITIONAL SERVICE.

02:36:04.254 --> 02:36:06.123
ESSENTIALLY REQUIRING ONE PUBLIC

02:36:06.190 --> 02:36:08.826

CHALLENGE WITH THE BILL IS THE

02:37:52.329 --> 02:37:55.232
SHIFT IN IN FUNDING -- THAT THE

02:38:23.527 --> 02:38:24.661
AND THAT IS A BIT WONKY BUT IT

02:38:24.728 --> 02:38:26.930
CREATES AN EXTREME COST PRESSURE

02:38:26.997 --> 02:38:29.466

02:40:36.960 --> 02:40:38.895
STRUGGLING TO MEET ALL THE

02:40:38.962 --> 02:40:39.463
STANDARDS THAT ARE PLACED ON

02:40:39.529 --> 02:40:40.998
THEM.

02:40:41.064 --> 02:40:43.166
AND HAVE NO ABILITY BILL EVEN

02:40:43.233 --> 02:40:44.768
RAISE RATES BECAUSE THEY'RE

02:40:44.835 --> 02:40:47.537
UNDER PROP TWO EIGHTEEN AND

02:40:47.604 --> 02:40:49.439
PEOPLE ARE GONNA RAISE RATES ARE

02:40:49.506 --> 02:40:50.040

THEIR HOME.

02:40:50.874 --> 02:40:52.109
THEY'RE IN SOME OF THESE

02:40:52.175 --> 02:40:53.677
COMMUNITIES.

02:40:53.744 --> 02:40:55.012
THE RATE WOULD BE HUNDREDS OF

02:40:55.078 --> 02:40:57.147
DOLLARS PER HALL PER HOUSEHOLD

02:40:57.214 --> 02:40:58.281
BECAUSE THERE'S JUST NOT ENOUGH

02:40:58.348 --> 02:41:00.951
VOLUME IN THESE SMALL TOWNS IN.

02:41:01.018 --> 02:41:02.919
THE TOWN THAT.

02:41:02.986 --> 02:41:04.454
WHEN MY KIDS GO TO SCHOOL IS

02:41:04.521 --> 02:41:07.491
FACED WITH THIS EXACT PROBLEM?

02:41:07.557 --> 02:41:08.025
IT'S BECAUSE THEY'VE BEEN

02:41:08.091 --> 02:41:10.460
REGULATED IN WHERE WE WE HAVE

02:41:10.527 --> 02:41:11.628
HIGHER STANDARDS.

02:41:11.695 --> 02:41:13.196
THAT WERE PUT ON THEM IN THE

02:41:13.263 --> 02:41:14.498
WHEN THEY FIRST DEVELOP THEIR

02:41:14.564 --> 02:41:15.132
WATER SYSTEMS [inaudible]

02:41:15.198 --> 02:41:16.266
SO [inaudible]

02:41:16.333 --> 02:41:18.168
IS.

02:41:18.235 --> 02:41:19.836
AT IT AT THE SAME POINT.

02:41:19.903 --> 02:41:22.039
THEY HAVE TO PERFORM.

02:41:22.105 --> 02:41:24.307
THE REGULATIONS AND THEY END UP.

02:41:24.374 --> 02:41:26.043
GOING BANKRUPT IT OR NOT THEY

02:41:26.109 --> 02:41:27.978
CAN'T GET WHERE THEY WILL WE

02:41:28.045 --> 02:41:28.512
WHEN THEY'RE FORCED TO GO

02:41:28.578 --> 02:41:28.812
[inaudible]

02:41:28.879 --> 02:41:33.950
SO -- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY I

02:41:34.017 --> 02:41:34.918
MEAN AT THE END OF THE DAY IT'S

02:41:34.985 --> 02:41:36.453
THIS BILL IS BASICALLY SAYING

02:41:36.520 --> 02:41:38.388
YOU CAN OFTEN BUT I ON THE OTHER

02:41:38.455 --> 02:41:41.625
HAND I HAVE ALL OF MY LARGE

02:41:41.691 --> 02:41:43.026
PURVEYORS THAT ARE.

02:41:43.093 --> 02:41:44.227
WORRIED THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE

02:41:44.294 --> 02:41:45.495
THAT THIS FIGHT IS GOING TO GET

02:41:45.562 --> 02:41:48.532
USED. TO OFFSET THE COST AND YOU

02:41:48.598 --> 02:41:49.733
KNOW AS I'VE OFTEN SAID IN

02:41:49.800 --> 02:41:52.335
CALIFORNIA IS A VERY DIVERSE

02:41:52.402 --> 02:41:54.704
STATE AND ONE SIZE FITS ALL

02:41:54.771 --> 02:41:56.339
REGULATIONS.

02:41:56.406 --> 02:41:59.176
DON'T ALWAYS WORK IN CALIFORNIA

02:41:59.242 --> 02:42:02.479
[inaudible] FOR EXAMPLE.

02:42:02.546 --> 02:42:04.481
THESE COMMUNITIES CAN'T.

02:42:04.548 --> 02:42:06.516
COMPLY THERE'S JUST NO WAY THEY

02:42:06.583 --> 02:42:08.151
CAN COMPLY AND THAT'S WHY YOU'RE

02:42:08.218 --> 02:42:08.852
SEEING THEM.

02:42:08.919 --> 02:42:11.154
OPT OUT.

02:42:11.221 --> 02:42:12.789
SO AS A STATEMENT MORE THAN IT

02:42:12.856 --> 02:42:14.991
IS OF IT I WOULD [inaudible]

02:42:15.058 --> 02:42:16.460
YOU KNOW.

02:42:16.526 --> 02:42:19.996
WE JUST BAILED OUT IN MY OPINION.

02:42:20.063 --> 02:42:20.730
YOU KNOW A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO

02:42:20.797 --> 02:42:21.431
WITH.

02:42:21.498 --> 02:42:23.500
CAP AND TRADE MONIES. TO DO

02:42:23.567 --> 02:42:25.402
WATER WHICH IS.

02:42:25.469 --> 02:42:27.637
AND IT'S LIKE THE TRAIN IT

02:42:27.704 --> 02:42:29.005
DOESN'T REALLY REDUCE CARBON IS

02:42:29.072 --> 02:42:30.740
THE WRONG AND I'M I'M A THROW IT

02:42:30.807 --> 02:42:31.942
OUT THERE BECAUSE IT JUST TICKS

02:42:32.008 --> 02:42:32.876
ME OFF THAT WE ARE.

02:42:32.943 --> 02:42:34.511
TAXIS ALMOND DIVERTING IT TO

02:42:34.578 --> 02:42:35.779
TAKE CARE OF THINGS THAT JUST

02:42:35.846 --> 02:42:37.147
AREN'T RIGHT.

02:42:37.214 --> 02:42:37.781
SO WE DO THAT KIND OF STUFF ALL

02:42:37.848 --> 02:42:40.784
THEIR IS WRONG.

02:42:40.851 --> 02:42:42.986
SO BUT TO FORCE REGULATIONS ON A

02:42:43.053 --> 02:42:44.788
COMMUNITY THAT CAN'T AFFORD IT

02:42:44.855 --> 02:42:45.689
AND THESE IT WE TALK ABOUT

02:42:45.755 --> 02:42:47.457
HELPING POOR PEOPLE ALL DAY LONG

02:42:47.524 --> 02:42:48.358
HERE.

02:42:48.425 --> 02:42:49.192
AND WE REALLY DON'T WE HURT THEM

02:42:49.259 --> 02:42:51.194
BY FORCING THEM AND SO WE NEED

02:42:51.261 --> 02:42:52.129
TO LET THEM KNOW WHAT'S IN THE

02:42:52.195 --> 02:42:54.164
WATER AND THEY HAVE TO TAKE THE

02:42:54.231 --> 02:42:54.798
RISK OF WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO

02:42:54.865 --> 02:42:55.866
BE ABLE.

02:42:55.932 --> 02:42:56.733
TO YOU KNOW THE AT PARTS PER

02:42:56.800 --> 02:42:59.169
BILLION.

02:42:59.236 --> 02:43:00.837
GREAT THAT WATER NOT SO.

02:43:00.904 --> 02:43:02.839
I'M A LOSS FOR HOW WE ACTUALLY

02:43:02.906 --> 02:43:04.708
GO FOR BECAUSE I HAVE LITERALLY

02:43:04.774 --> 02:43:06.143
HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITIES THAT I

02:43:06.209 --> 02:43:07.611
REPRESENT A EVEN MORE NOW THAT

02:43:07.677 --> 02:43:08.845
I'M IN THE SENATE.

02:43:08.912 --> 02:43:10.247
THAT ARE FACED WITH THESE

02:43:10.313 --> 02:43:11.648
REGULATIONS AND CAN'T MAKE IT

02:43:11.715 --> 02:43:13.283
WORK [inaudible]

02:43:13.350 --> 02:43:16.553

EXEMPT OUT OF SOME OF THESE

02:43:28.465 --> 02:43:29.533
CRAZY.

02:43:29.599 --> 02:43:32.903
REGULATIONS THAT THEY'RE IN.

02:43:32.969 --> 02:43:34.604
OKAY WELL OF COURSE THE BILL

02:43:34.671 --> 02:43:36.773

02:44:13.777 --> 02:44:15.712
ISSUE WE FACING IN THE AND THE

02:44:15.779 --> 02:44:16.980
ISSUE WE FACE IS.

02:44:17.047 --> 02:44:19.249

GETS FEES FROM THOSE

02:44:30.627 --> 02:44:32.295
JURISDICTION THOSE WATER SYSTEMS

02:44:32.362 --> 02:44:34.297
THAT THEY REGULATE.

02:44:34.364 --> 02:44:35.932
IF THEY GIVE THE FEEDBACK TO THE

02:44:35.999 --> 02:44:37.634
STATE.

02:44:37.701 --> 02:44:39.669
THE STATE WILL GET IT FROM THE

02:44:39.736 --> 02:44:40.904
BROUGHT A POT.

02:44:40.971 --> 02:44:44.874
SO THAT IS WHERE YOU'LL SEE THE

02:44:44.941 --> 02:44:46.843
EFFICIENCY OF THIS BILL.

02:44:46.910 --> 02:44:50.413
RIGHT NOW THE STATE USES.

02:44:50.480 --> 02:44:52.082
I'M THAT MUCH BROADER FUND THAT

02:44:52.148 --> 02:44:54.918
HAS MULTIPLE FUNDING SOURCES THE

02:44:54.985 --> 02:44:56.686
LOCALS ERNIE HAVE.

02:44:56.753 --> 02:44:58.221
THAT ONE SOURCE WHICH IS THEIR

02:44:58.288 --> 02:44:59.990
SMALL DRINKING WATER SYSTEM AND

02:45:00.056 --> 02:45:02.259
SINCE WE WHEN WE SUPPORTED THE

02:45:02.325 --> 02:45:03.927
POLICY FOR THE DISADVANTAGED

02:45:03.994 --> 02:45:05.362
COMMUNITIES.

02:45:05.428 --> 02:45:06.630
JOURNEY PAY A HUNDRED DOLLARS

02:45:06.696 --> 02:45:08.331
SINCE THAT WAS ADOPTED BY THE

02:45:08.398 --> 02:45:10.033
WATER BOARD WE PUT AN EVEN

02:45:10.100 --> 02:45:12.202
BIGGER SQUEEZE WE SUPPORT THAT

02:45:12.269 --> 02:45:13.703
THE DISADVANTAGED.

02:45:13.770 --> 02:45:15.305
SHOULD GET SUPPORT BUT NOW WE

02:45:15.372 --> 02:45:17.073
HAVE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS THAT

02:45:17.140 --> 02:45:18.141
CAN ONLY CHARGE A HUNDRED

02:45:18.208 --> 02:45:20.210
DOLLARS FOR A FOR A SERVICE THAT

02:45:20.277 --> 02:45:23.079
COSTS YOU KNOW FIVE HUNDRED SIX

02:45:23.146 --> 02:45:23.747
HUNDRED SEVEN HUNDRED DOLLARS IN

02:45:23.813 --> 02:45:24.114
THAT COMMUNITY.

02:45:24.180 --> 02:45:27.350
SO WE DO SEE THIS AS A WAY OF

02:45:27.417 --> 02:45:29.452
BASICALLY USING THE SAME FUNDING

02:45:29.519 --> 02:45:30.887
MECHANISM THE STATE.

02:45:30.954 --> 02:45:32.822
IT'S CURRENTLY USING AND WOULD

02:45:32.889 --> 02:45:34.424
BE USING ON THE SELF SAME

02:45:34.491 --> 02:45:35.992
SYSTEMS IF WE HAD TO GIVE THEM

02:45:36.059 --> 02:45:36.826
BACK.

02:45:36.893 --> 02:45:39.329
SO THERE'S NO CHANGE IN THE

02:45:39.396 --> 02:45:40.297
FIELD.

02:45:40.363 --> 02:45:41.798
THIRTY THIS ISN'T A NEW TAX THIS

02:45:41.865 --> 02:45:44.234
ISN'T A NEW PROGRAM IT'S SIMPLY

02:45:44.301 --> 02:45:46.102
ALLOWING THE LOCALS TO KEEP THE

02:45:46.169 --> 02:45:47.671
PROGRAM RATHER THAN THE STATE

02:45:47.737 --> 02:45:49.105
TAKING THE PROGRAM BACK.

02:45:49.172 --> 02:45:51.341
AND I CAN TELL YOU WE HAVE DONE

02:45:51.408 --> 02:45:53.076
SOME PRELIMINARY NUMBERS AND I

02:45:53.143 --> 02:45:54.611
HAVEN'T COMPLETELY DRUNK LOCAL

02:45:54.678 --> 02:45:56.780
KOOL-AID NOT SAYING EVERY LOCAL

02:45:56.846 --> 02:45:57.847
JURISDICTION IS BETTER OR MORE

02:45:57.914 --> 02:45:58.815
EFFICIENT.

02:45:58.882 --> 02:46:01.651
BUT WE CAN SEE WE CAN SHOW A

02:46:01.718 --> 02:46:04.154
FIFTEEN OR 20% REDUCTION IN COST

02:46:04.220 --> 02:46:05.989
OVERRULED IF THE LOCALS KEEP THE

02:46:06.056 --> 02:46:08.792
PROGRAM FOR ALL THOSE REASONS AT

02:46:08.858 --> 02:46:10.160
YOUR LOCAL LBJ'S EXPLAINED.

02:46:10.226 --> 02:46:14.564
SO LET ME SAY THAT IF THE LOCALS.

02:46:14.631 --> 02:46:15.398
FEEL THAT THEY CAN'T DO THIS

02:46:15.465 --> 02:46:17.233
PROGRAM.

02:46:17.300 --> 02:46:19.269
THEY WILL THEY CAN ALL OPT OUT

02:46:19.336 --> 02:46:21.805
ALL GO TO THE STATE AND THE FEES

02:46:21.871 --> 02:46:23.406
YOU WILL PAY.

02:46:23.473 --> 02:46:24.974
WITH THE SAME WE'RE TALKING ON

02:46:25.041 --> 02:46:26.710
TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW THERE

02:46:26.776 --> 02:46:29.579
WILL BE NO CHANGE IN FEES IF

02:46:29.646 --> 02:46:32.215
EVERY AGENCY GAVE UP.

02:46:32.282 --> 02:46:35.118
COMPARED TO THIS PROGRAM HERE.

02:46:35.185 --> 02:46:37.821
THE ONLY CHANGE THIS MAKES IS TO

02:46:37.887 --> 02:46:39.322
SAY THAT THE LOCALS CONTINUE TO

02:46:39.389 --> 02:46:41.424
DO THE WORK THE FEES WILL NOT

02:46:41.491 --> 02:46:43.226
CHANGE [inaudible]

02:46:43.293 --> 02:46:44.761
ASSUMING.

02:46:44.828 --> 02:46:46.363
THAT PEOPLE WOULD HAVE OPTED OUT

02:46:46.429 --> 02:46:48.631
ANYWAY BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD

02:46:48.698 --> 02:46:48.798
IT.

02:46:48.865 --> 02:46:50.867
SO IF THE COURT THE PRESS CAN

02:46:50.934 --> 02:46:52.469
HEAR IS.

02:46:52.535 --> 02:46:54.270
DO THEY OPT OUT WE NO LONGER

02:46:54.337 --> 02:46:55.705
HAVE LOCAL CONTROL AND OF COURSE

02:46:55.772 --> 02:46:58.041
THEN THE FEES ARE PAID BY THESE

02:46:58.108 --> 02:47:00.777
OTHER WATER PRODUCERS OR DO WE

02:47:00.844 --> 02:47:01.478
ALLOW WORD.

02:47:01.544 --> 02:47:04.347
LOCALS TO DO THE INSPECTION AND

02:47:04.414 --> 02:47:06.116
THE FEES ARE PAID POINT IS FEES

02:47:06.182 --> 02:47:08.084
WON'T CHANGE WHETHER THEY OPT

02:47:08.151 --> 02:47:10.587
OUT OR THEY GO INTO THIS PROGRAM

02:47:10.653 --> 02:47:10.887
[inaudible]

02:47:10.954 --> 02:47:12.288
END.

02:47:12.355 --> 02:47:15.125
SINCE THE FEES WON'T CHANGE.

02:47:15.191 --> 02:47:15.925
YOU KNOW I DON'T REALLY

02:47:15.992 --> 02:47:18.261
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY'RE OBJECTING.

02:47:18.328 --> 02:47:20.597

02:47:20.663 --> 02:47:23.333
ALL THIS DOES IS ENSURE LOCAL

02:47:23.400 --> 02:47:27.003

02:47:31.174 --> 02:47:32.675
GUARDRAILS ON THIS PROGRAM SO

02:47:32.742 --> 02:47:34.878
WHAT ONE OF OUR CONCERNS IS IS

02:47:34.944 --> 02:47:35.678
THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CREATE A%

02:47:35.745 --> 02:47:37.080
SITUATION WHERE EVEN COUNTIES

02:47:37.147 --> 02:47:38.415
THAT ARE OTHERWISE SELF

02:47:38.481 --> 02:47:40.483
SUSTAINABLE WILL OPT INTO THIS

02:47:40.550 --> 02:47:42.619
PROGRAM BECAUSE WHITE WHY WOULD

02:47:42.685 --> 02:47:45.121
THEY NOT YOU EITHER THEY HAVE.

02:47:45.188 --> 02:47:47.257
TO RE ASSESS THE RATES AND

02:47:47.323 --> 02:47:48.591
COLLECT THE REVENUE WILL.

02:47:48.658 --> 02:47:50.260
OR THEY CAN HAVE THE STATE WATER

02:47:50.326 --> 02:47:51.628
BOARD DO THAT WITH A GIANT

02:47:51.694 --> 02:47:54.931
SUBSIDY FROM OUR MEMBERS. ONE OF

02:47:54.998 --> 02:47:56.566
OUR WORK CONCERNED THAT THERE IS

02:47:56.633 --> 02:47:58.668
ABSOLUTELY NO NEXUS BETWEEN THE

02:47:58.735 --> 02:48:00.470
FUNDING SOURCE AND WHO BENEFITS

02:48:00.537 --> 02:48:02.172
FROM THIS PROGRAM ONE OF THE

02:48:02.238 --> 02:48:04.140
REASONS AS JUSTIN EXPLAINED THAT

02:48:04.207 --> 02:48:06.443
THIS PAIN DELEGATES THIS PROGRAM.

02:48:06.509 --> 02:48:09.179
IS BECAUSE IT SAVES THE STATE

02:48:09.245 --> 02:48:11.181
MONEY BUT THE STATE HAS NO SKIN

02:48:11.247 --> 02:48:12.115
IN THE GAME UNDERNEATH THIS

02:48:12.182 --> 02:48:14.284
PROGRAM AGAIN THEY'VE GONE TO

02:48:14.350 --> 02:48:16.553
DRINKING WATER FEES.

02:48:16.619 --> 02:48:17.620
WITHOUT.

02:48:17.687 --> 02:48:19.389
EXAMINING ANY ALTERNATIVE

02:48:19.456 --> 02:48:21.724
FUNDING SOURCES AS ONE OF THE

02:48:21.791 --> 02:48:23.560
SPEAKERS IN OPPOSITION SAID NOT

02:48:23.626 --> 02:48:24.627
WERE CONCERNED ABOUT THE

02:48:24.694 --> 02:48:25.995
PRESIDENT AND WE ARE CONCERNED

02:48:26.062 --> 02:48:27.063
ABOUT HOW THIS BILL WILL BE

02:48:27.130 --> 02:48:29.032
IMPLEMENTED WE KNOW THAT NOT

02:48:29.098 --> 02:48:29.999
EVERY.

02:48:30.066 --> 02:48:31.668
COUNTY IS GOING TO BE RETURNING

02:48:31.734 --> 02:48:33.937
THERE AT THE READY TO THE STATE

02:48:34.003 --> 02:48:36.072
WITH WITHOUT THIS PROGRAM BUT

02:48:36.139 --> 02:48:37.474
EVERY COUNTY WOULD HAVE A

02:48:37.540 --> 02:48:39.042
TREMENDOUS INCENTIVE TO OPT INTO

02:48:39.108 --> 02:48:40.276
THIS PROGRAM AND THE LATEST

02:48:40.343 --> 02:48:41.211
AMENDMENTS.

02:48:41.277 --> 02:48:42.912
ALLOW THE STATE WATER BOARD TO

02:48:42.979 --> 02:48:43.880
REACH OUT TO ALL TWENTY EIGHT

02:48:43.947 --> 02:48:45.548
COUNTIES THAT ARE NOT IN -- PA

02:48:45.615 --> 02:48:47.984
OFFER THEM THE ABILITY TO BECOME

02:48:48.051 --> 02:48:49.185
ONE AND PARTICIPATE IN THIS

02:48:49.252 --> 02:48:51.654
PROGRAM THAT IT IS EXTREMELY

02:48:51.721 --> 02:48:54.691
CONCERNING TO US -- MISTER CHAIR.

02:48:54.757 --> 02:48:57.393
BOB I'LL JUST POINT OUT THAT.

02:48:57.460 --> 02:49:00.330
IF IF THEY ARE SELF SUSTAINING.

02:49:00.396 --> 02:49:02.732
ALL THAT MONEY UNDER THIS BILL

02:49:02.799 --> 02:49:05.168
WOULD GO IN AND THE STATE.

02:49:05.235 --> 02:49:06.336
IT WOULD MAKE NO DIFFERENCE TO

02:49:06.402 --> 02:49:07.770
THEM THEY WOULDN'T HAVE TO IF

02:49:07.837 --> 02:49:10.073
THERE ARE SELF SUSTAINING NOW.

02:49:10.139 --> 02:49:11.841
THAN THE STATE WATER BOARD ISN'T

02:49:11.908 --> 02:49:13.276
GOING TO HAVE TO ADD NEW FEES.

02:49:13.343 --> 02:49:15.478
SO THE ONLY WAY THIS IS AFFECTED

02:49:15.545 --> 02:49:18.982
HIS IF YOU HAVE A COUNTY WITH

02:49:19.048 --> 02:49:22.318
MANY SMALL SYSTEMS.

02:49:22.385 --> 02:49:23.686
AND THEY CAN'T MAKE IT ON THEIR

02:49:23.753 --> 02:49:26.356
OWN.

02:49:26.422 --> 02:49:26.990
THEN THEY'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO

02:49:27.056 --> 02:49:29.025
TO THE STATE.

02:49:29.092 --> 02:49:31.961
AND THE AND THE CHOICE IS EITHER

02:49:32.028 --> 02:49:34.697
IT'S DONE BY THE LOCALS.

02:49:34.764 --> 02:49:36.466
AND PAID FOR BY THROUGH THE THIS

02:49:36.533 --> 02:49:38.434
SYSTEM OR IT'S PAID THROUGH THE

02:49:38.501 --> 02:49:41.271
SYSTEM AND THE STATE DOES IT.

02:49:41.337 --> 02:49:42.705
SO THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IS IS IT

02:49:42.772 --> 02:49:44.707
LOCAL CONTROL OR STATE CONTROL

02:49:44.774 --> 02:49:46.442
THERE'S NO DIFFERENCE IN THE WAY

02:49:46.509 --> 02:49:49.279
THE MONEY IS ALLOCATED PERIOD.

02:49:49.345 --> 02:49:51.881
BUT I'M A NUMBERS GUY -- I KNOW

TAXPAYERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE

EXEMPTIONS NEEDS TO GO TO THE

02:50:11.467 --> 02:50:13.002
COST OF PROVIDING THE SERVICE

GOAL THAT WE SET UP TO OTHERS IS

02:52:30.673 --> 02:52:32.341
THERE ARE THERE MANY SEPARATE

02:52:32.408 --> 02:52:34.777
BILLS DEALING WITH CONSOLIDATION

AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED NOTHING

02:52:53.963 --> 02:52:55.231

AUTHORS COMFORTABLE WITH.

02:53:04.841 --> 02:53:06.442
AND THAT IS FOR THE L. P. A.'S

02:53:06.509 --> 02:53:07.977
TO REPORT TO THE STATE WATER

02:53:08.044 --> 02:53:10.980
BOARD IN THEIR JURISDICTIONS ON

WHICH SMALL WATER SYSTEMS ARE

02:53:12.849 --> 02:53:16.219
ELIGIBLE OR WOULD BE ADVISABLE

02:53:16.285 --> 02:53:16.652

ON THE VIABILITY OF THESE

02:53:47.750 --> 02:53:49.552
SYSTEMS TO REDUCE THE COST TO

02:53:49.619 --> 02:53:50.386
EVERYBODY.

BUILDING OF SINGLE FAMILY HOMES

03:03:44.947 --> 03:03:46.115

THOUSANDS OF FIRE VICTIMS.

03:04:18.714 --> 03:04:20.349
THE PROBLEM IS IS QUITE SIMPLY

03:04:20.416 --> 03:04:21.750
THAT THERE ISN'T HOUSING

THE STATE.

03:04:34.997 --> 03:04:36.999
ON THE AFFORDABILITY INDEX IN

03:04:37.065 --> 03:04:38.734
THE AFTERMATH OF THE FIRE -- THE

03:04:38.801 --> 03:04:40.602
RENTAL MARKET VACANCY RATE ALSO

03:04:40.669 --> 03:04:43.305
FELL TO NEARLY 0%.

03:04:43.372 --> 03:04:45.507
AFTER THE FIRE IN ALL OF THIS IS

03:04:45.574 --> 03:04:47.242
MAKING IT VERY EXTREMELY

03:04:47.309 --> 03:04:49.378
DIFFICULT. FOR CAN'T FIRE

03:04:49.445 --> 03:04:51.480
VICTIMS AND OTHERS AS THEY

03:04:51.547 --> 03:04:53.148
STRUGGLE TO FIND HOUSING EVEN

03:04:53.215 --> 03:04:54.917

03:04:58.187 --> 03:04:59.488
MAKE ROOM.

03:04:59.555 --> 03:05:02.157
FOR REMOVING AND FIRE VICTIMS SO --

03:05:02.224 --> 03:05:03.125
AND EVEN THOUGH MANY WANT TO

03:05:03.192 --> 03:05:04.259
STAY IN THIS AREA WHERE THEY

03:05:04.326 --> 03:05:06.962
HAVE JOBS AND FAMILY AND AND

03:05:07.029 --> 03:05:08.397
COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS.

03:05:08.464 --> 03:05:10.866
THIS IS ALL MAKING IT VERY HARD

03:05:10.933 --> 03:05:12.568

THE CAMPUSES OF WONDERFUL DAY.

03:05:20.409 --> 03:05:21.643

STAFF WARRANT REPORT SHOWS

03:32:41.448 --> 03:32:42.983
THERE'S VERY VERY LITTLE SEQUEL

03:32:43.050 --> 03:32:44.218
A LITIGATION THAT'S COME OUT OF

03:32:44.284 --> 03:32:46.587
THIS IN OUR PARTICULAR AREA.

03:32:46.653 --> 03:32:48.989

LARGE SCALE.

RECENTLY WAS CHALLENGED ON

03:32:55.796 --> 03:32:57.097
ISSUES OTHER THAN SEEK WHAT.

AND I ABSOLUTELY AGREE WITH THE

03:32:58.765 --> 03:33:00.367
POINT THAT WAS MADE THAT THE

GENERAL PLAN PROCESS DOES NOT

03:33:02.669 --> 03:33:04.171
ADEQUATELY PROTECT.

03:33:04.238 --> 03:33:06.140
THE KIND OF ANALYSIS NEEDS TO BE

03:33:06.206 --> 03:33:08.976
DONE PARTICULARLY ON CUMULATIVE.

03:33:09.042 --> 03:33:11.445
REGIONAL DEVELOPMENT IMPACTS

03:33:11.512 --> 03:33:14.348
SPECIFICALLY AS WELL FROM CARBON

03:33:14.414 --> 03:33:16.016
EMISSIONS THAT THIS LEGISLATURE

03:33:16.083 --> 03:33:18.051

AVOID IN ORDER TO SAVE.

03:33:19.987 --> 03:33:21.522

THAT IS MADE BY THE SUPPORTERS

03:33:24.424 --> 03:33:27.227
OF THE BILL IS THAT -- EVEN IF

03:33:27.294 --> 03:33:28.595
SEE WHAT HASN'T BEEN USED TO

03:33:28.662 --> 03:33:29.863
CHALLENGE PROJECTS.

03:33:29.930 --> 03:33:31.131
IT.

03:33:31.198 --> 03:33:31.999
SLOWS DOWN [inaudible]

03:33:32.065 --> 03:33:35.502
THE CONSTRUCTION BECAUSE PEOPLE

ON THE SANTA ROSA AND THE OTHER

03:33:46.446 --> 03:33:48.649
DISASTER RECOVERY IS IT'S NOT

03:33:48.715 --> 03:33:50.584

IN FACT THE COUNTY EXECUTIVE FOR

03:33:53.554 --> 03:33:55.556
BUTTE COUNTY SAID IT THE PRIMARY

03:33:55.622 --> 03:33:57.558
PROBLEM IS LACK OF CONSTRUCTION

03:33:57.624 --> 03:33:58.458
LABOR.

03:33:58.525 --> 03:34:00.627
AND THE HIGH COST OF MATERIALS

03:34:00.694 --> 03:34:01.929
THAT'S WHAT'S SLOWING THINGS

03:34:01.995 --> 03:34:03.130
DOWN.

03:34:03.197 --> 03:34:05.566

03:41:38.118 --> 03:41:40.754
AND DIFFICULT -- AND SO I THINK

03:41:40.820 --> 03:41:41.521
PART OF WHAT WE'VE BEEN

03:41:41.588 --> 03:41:43.323

OPPOSE MANY ATTEMPTS TO MAKE ANY

03:41:55.101 --> 03:41:56.102
CHANGES EQUAL I MEAN THERE IS A

03:41:56.169 --> 03:41:57.303

SIERRA CLUB POSE THAT.

03:42:18.658 --> 03:42:19.959
ASSOCIATED WITH THE C<u>&lt;c.cyan&gt; AND&lt;/c&gt;</u>

03:42:20.026 --> 03:42:21.428
YET HERE WE HAVE AN EXAMPLE OF A

03:42:21.494 --> 03:42:23.697

WITH THE FIRE I I UNDERSTAND

03:42:44.317 --> 03:42:46.786

NEVER WE HAD AN ENTIRE CITY JUST

03:43:07.240 --> 03:43:08.441
BURN TO THE GROUND IN THE WAY WE

03:43:08.508 --> 03:43:09.375

WHERE WE REALLY CAN ALL FEEL

03:46:53.299 --> 03:46:55.101
COMFORTABLE -- AND AND I THINK

VISITED PARADISE AND I WENT

03:48:44.710 --> 03:48:46.612
THROUGH THOSE TOWNS THE IN THE

03:48:46.679 --> 03:48:48.581
AREA AND SAW THEM I I I GUESS

03:48:48.648 --> 03:48:49.782
I'M KIND OF STRUCK WITH THE

03:48:49.849 --> 03:48:51.717
DEVASTATION THAT I SAW THE

03:48:51.784 --> 03:48:53.019
CHALLENGES THAT THE RESIDENTS

03:48:53.086 --> 03:48:53.619
ARE FACING NOW.

03:48:53.686 --> 03:48:55.054
LIVING IN CHICO AND THE OTHER

03:48:55.121 --> 03:48:56.789
CITIES.

03:48:56.856 --> 03:48:59.258
IN IN CONDITIONS THAT ARE -- ARE

03:48:59.325 --> 03:49:01.327
CHALLENGING HAVE NOTHING ELSE I

03:49:01.394 --> 03:49:01.861
MEAN THEY'RE THEY'RE VERY

03:49:01.928 --> 03:49:02.929
DESPERATE.

03:49:02.995 --> 03:49:04.430
AND AS I HEARD THE OPPOSITION

03:49:04.497 --> 03:49:05.998
TALK ABOUT THE UNPRECEDENTED

03:49:06.065 --> 03:49:09.869
NATURE OF THIS WELL AS THE

03:49:09.936 --> 03:49:11.170
AMPLIFIERS WERE UNPRECEDENTED.

03:49:11.237 --> 03:49:12.038
AND THEY LEFT COMMUNITIES YEAH

03:49:12.105 --> 03:49:12.605
I'M IN THE TOWN OF PARADISE

03:49:12.672 --> 03:49:14.140
COMPLETELY DESTROYED.

03:49:14.207 --> 03:49:16.776
AND HOW CAN WE NOT LOOK AT

03:49:16.843 --> 03:49:18.411
TRYING TO FIND A SOLUTION WHEN.

03:49:18.478 --> 03:49:19.412
IT.

03:49:19.479 --> 03:49:22.048
THE ISSUE OF TAKING.

03:49:22.115 --> 03:49:24.083
SAY GOING TO GRIDLEY OR BIGGER

03:49:24.150 --> 03:49:25.685
SUMMIT OR ORVILLE.

03:49:25.751 --> 03:49:27.587
AND ALLOWING THIS I'VE

03:49:27.653 --> 03:49:28.855
UNDERSTAND IN THE FEMA.

03:49:28.921 --> 03:49:30.456
TRAILERS ARE GOING TO BE BUILT

03:49:30.523 --> 03:49:33.159
IN WHICH CITY OF MASTIC.

03:49:33.226 --> 03:49:35.995
GRIDLEY AND HOW MANY OF THEM DO

03:49:36.062 --> 03:49:37.430
WE HAVE. FOR FOUR HUNDRED UNIT

03:49:37.497 --> 03:49:38.331
HUNDRED UNITS ARE BEING BUILDING

03:49:38.397 --> 03:49:39.999
GREATLY RIGHT NOW OF TRAILERS

03:49:40.066 --> 03:49:41.367
THAT WILL BE THERE FOR A SHORT

03:49:41.434 --> 03:49:42.802
PERIOD OF TIME.

03:49:42.869 --> 03:49:44.871
AND WHEN THOSE EXPIRE AND AND

03:49:44.937 --> 03:49:46.105
WHEN THEY'RE GONE THEY'RE GONE

03:49:46.172 --> 03:49:47.507
THOSE PEOPLE WILL BE WITHOUT

03:49:47.573 --> 03:49:48.674
HOME.

03:49:48.741 --> 03:49:49.976
AND I THINK IT'S INCUMBENT UPON

03:49:50.042 --> 03:49:51.310
US TO DO SOMETHING TO MAKE SURE

03:49:51.377 --> 03:49:53.045
THAT THAT THEY'RE NOT LEFT

03:49:53.112 --> 03:49:54.747
HOMELESS AGAIN -- AND IT'S

03:49:54.814 --> 03:49:55.915
IMPORTANT FOR US TO DO IS THE

03:49:55.982 --> 03:49:58.484
FEAR OF SPRAWL TO ME I THINK IS.

03:49:58.551 --> 03:50:01.120
IS -- I MEAN THIS SIX DISC

03:50:01.187 --> 03:50:03.022
SUNSET IN TWENTY TWENTY SIX HOW

03:50:03.089 --> 03:50:03.789
MANY HOMES ARE WE GOING TO BUILD

03:50:03.856 --> 03:50:04.957
IN THAT LENGTH OF TIME.

03:50:05.024 --> 03:50:06.192
YOUR QUESTION IS NOT ENOUGH THAT

03:50:06.259 --> 03:50:08.060
WILL MAKE YOU KNOW CREATE THIS

03:50:08.127 --> 03:50:09.462
FOR ALL THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT

03:50:09.529 --> 03:50:13.032
THIS I SEE IT -- THE A LARGE

03:50:13.099 --> 03:50:14.600
SCALE DEVELOPMENTS THESE ARE

03:50:14.667 --> 03:50:15.868
PEOPLE WHO LIVED IN SINGLE

03:50:15.935 --> 03:50:17.870
FAMILY HOMES WITH A LOT OF A

03:50:17.937 --> 03:50:19.572
CREATURE AROUND THEM YEAH THE

03:50:19.639 --> 03:50:21.040
IDEA OF THEM MOVING INTO TRACK

03:50:21.107 --> 03:50:23.543
HOMES IS THIS NOT SOMETHING THAT

03:50:23.609 --> 03:50:24.110
I CAN SEE.

03:50:24.177 --> 03:50:26.946
AS A POSSIBILITY AND I LOOK AT

03:50:27.013 --> 03:50:29.048
THE CONDITIONS THAT ARE THAT ARE

03:50:29.115 --> 03:50:30.683
ON HERE AND AND TO ME.

03:50:30.750 --> 03:50:32.618
THE MOST VALUED ENVIRONMENTAL

03:50:32.685 --> 03:50:35.821
ORGANIZATION.

03:50:35.888 --> 03:50:36.689
IN CALIFORNIA IS A SIERRA CLUB.

03:50:36.756 --> 03:50:37.256
AND THEY'VE TAKEN A NEUTRAL

03:50:37.323 --> 03:50:39.425
POSITION BECAUSE THEY RESPECT

03:50:39.492 --> 03:50:40.026
THE WORK THAT THE AUTHOR HAS

03:50:40.092 --> 03:50:42.828
DONE IN IN IDENTIFYING IN LAYING

03:50:42.895 --> 03:50:44.530
OUT THOSE CONDITIONS OF WHERE

03:50:44.597 --> 03:50:45.665
THIS BILL COULD WORK YEAH.

03:50:45.731 --> 03:50:47.600
SO I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL

03:50:47.667 --> 03:50:49.035
AND SUPPORTED TO THAT THAT

03:50:49.101 --> 03:50:50.336
CONVERSATION CAN CONTINUE NOW

03:50:50.403 --> 03:50:52.805

03:50:55.808 --> 03:50:57.176
NOT MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD

03:50:57.243 --> 03:50:58.811
WE'RE LEAVING AND DESERT IN A

03:50:58.878 --> 03:51:00.680
COMMUNITY THAT HAS ALREADY BEEN.

GENERAL PLANS OF ALL THE CITY'S

03:52:07.280 --> 03:52:08.614
INVOLVED A WONDERFUL.

03:52:08.681 --> 03:52:10.283
I ALSO ENVY THE COLOR PRINTING

03:52:10.349 --> 03:52:11.150

THERE AT LEAST IN PLACES LIKE

03:52:23.462 --> 03:52:24.597
YUBA CITY BUT ALSO ELSEWHERE

03:52:24.664 --> 03:52:26.132
THERE'S AN INTERESTING IDEA OF A

03:52:26.198 --> 03:52:27.433
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE I LOVE TO

03:52:27.500 --> 03:52:28.868
HAVE IN THE SPHERE OF INFLUENCE.

03:52:28.934 --> 03:52:30.469
OVER ON THE COMMITTEE YOU KNOW

03:52:30.536 --> 03:52:32.138
BUT BUT WHAT WHAT IS THAT WE'RE

03:52:32.204 --> 03:52:33.639
DECIDED TO PLAY WITH THE BILL

03:52:33.706 --> 03:52:35.107
AND CITY LIMITS VERSUS SPHERE OF

03:52:35.174 --> 03:52:36.809
INFLUENCE.

03:52:36.876 --> 03:52:39.111
SO BUSTER OF INFLUENCES COMMON

03:52:39.178 --> 03:52:40.012
YOU KNOW CITIES WILL HAVE A

03:52:40.079 --> 03:52:41.580
SPHERE OF INFLUENCE IS KIND OF

03:52:41.647 --> 03:52:43.182
LIKE WHERE THEY WOULD LIKE. TO

03:52:43.249 --> 03:52:44.917
POSSIBLY GO IN THE FUTURE BUT IT

03:52:44.984 --> 03:52:46.319
HASN'T BEEN ANNEXED.

03:52:46.385 --> 03:52:48.354
INTO THE CITY LIMITS OKAY SO

03:52:48.421 --> 03:52:50.089
UNDER THIS BILL IT DOESN'T ALLOW

03:52:50.156 --> 03:52:51.757
YOU TO BUILD.

03:52:51.824 --> 03:52:54.393
CARTE BLANCHE IN THE SPHERE OF

03:52:54.460 --> 03:52:55.928
INFLUENCE IT EITHER HAS TO BE IN

03:52:55.995 --> 03:52:57.830
THE CITY LIMITS.

03:52:57.897 --> 03:52:59.865
OR IT HAS TO BE A SPECIALLY

03:52:59.932 --> 03:53:02.702
PLANNED RESIDENTIAL AREA THAT

03:53:02.768 --> 03:53:04.036
CONTAINED IN THE CITY'S GENERAL

03:53:04.103 --> 03:53:05.604
PLAN.

03:53:05.671 --> 03:53:08.274
NOW CAN YOU BE IN THE SPHERE OF

03:53:08.341 --> 03:53:08.841
INFLUENCE AND IN THE GENERAL

03:53:08.908 --> 03:53:10.710
PLAN.

03:53:10.776 --> 03:53:12.311
YES YOU CAN BE HOW DOES THAT

03:53:12.378 --> 03:53:14.613
WORK IN IN INTERACTION WITH THE

03:53:14.680 --> 03:53:16.916
THE COUNTY GOVERNMENT.

03:53:16.982 --> 03:53:18.517
WELL YOU HAVE TO GO TO A LAUGH

03:53:18.584 --> 03:53:20.319
CO PROCESS TO ANNEX THAT

03:53:20.386 --> 03:53:23.389
PROPERTY INTO THE CITY LIMITS.

03:53:23.456 --> 03:53:24.757
OKAY SO AT THAT POINT.

03:53:24.824 --> 03:53:26.525
IT WOULD HAVE TO BE ADDED TO THE

03:53:26.592 --> 03:53:28.227
CITY LIMITS TO BE ABLE TO

03:53:28.294 --> 03:53:31.097
ULTIMATELY ENJOY THE RIGHT WELL

03:53:31.163 --> 03:53:32.631
I MEAN IF THEY'VE HAD IF THEY'VE

03:53:32.698 --> 03:53:34.233
PLANTED IN THEIR GENERAL PLAN AS

03:53:34.300 --> 03:53:36.802
A SPECIALIZED RESIDENTIAL ZONE.

03:53:36.869 --> 03:53:38.571
THAT'S WHAT THE LANGUAGE SAYS

03:53:38.637 --> 03:53:40.172
THEN THAT WOULD BE ELIGIBLE

03:53:40.239 --> 03:53:42.842
RIGHT -- BUT I MEAN YOU CAN LOOK

03:53:42.908 --> 03:53:43.409
THROUGH ALL THOSE DIFFERENT

MIGHT NOT HAPPEN BECAUSE THERE'S

03:56:26.605 --> 03:56:27.740
NO PLACE TO GO.

03:56:27.806 --> 03:56:28.374
DOES THAT MEAN THAT THEY DON'T

03:56:28.440 --> 03:56:29.441
WANT TO COME BACK THERE DOES

03:56:29.508 --> 03:56:30.743
THAT MEAN THAT THEY DON'T HAVE

ROOTS IN THAT COMMUNITY I BEG TO

03:56:32.611 --> 03:56:34.046
DIFFER I'VE I HAVE A LOT OF MY

03:56:34.113 --> 03:56:35.247
CONSTITUENTS WHO.

03:56:35.314 --> 03:56:37.149
ARE IN REDDING I I REPRESENT

03:56:37.216 --> 03:56:38.651

ARE IN READING RIGHT NOW.

03:56:41.820 --> 03:56:44.023
SO WE'VE TOGETHER THE TWO OF US

03:56:44.089 --> 03:56:45.524
HAVE TRIED TO DIVIDE UP THE

03:56:45.591 --> 03:56:47.192
PIECES LEGISLATION.

03:56:47.259 --> 03:56:50.195
I WORKED ON A SOLAR EXEMPTION.

03:56:50.262 --> 03:56:50.796
FOR AND WHICH WAS IN FRONT OF

03:56:50.863 --> 03:56:53.799
THIS -- ENERGY COMMITTEE SORRY.

03:56:53.866 --> 03:56:55.701

DOWN I HAVE OPPOSITION FROM

03:56:57.836 --> 03:56:59.238
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS ON MOST.

03:56:59.305 --> 03:57:01.006
OF MY LEGISLATION I WORK ON WHEN

03:57:01.073 --> 03:57:03.175
IT COMES TO NATURAL RESOURCES.

03:57:03.242 --> 03:57:04.610
WE WERE MY POINT IS IS THAT I

03:57:04.677 --> 03:57:07.046
THINK THAT THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER

03:57:07.112 --> 03:57:08.914
HAS DONE A GREAT JOB OF BEING

03:57:08.981 --> 03:57:10.549
REALISTIC HERE AND COMMONSENSE

03:57:10.616 --> 03:57:11.717
APPROACH TO THIS.

03:57:11.784 --> 03:57:13.319
THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION.

03:57:13.385 --> 03:57:14.954
AND ALSO LIKE.

03:57:15.020 --> 03:57:16.355
TO POINT OUT THAT [inaudible]

03:57:16.422 --> 03:57:19.058
SOME.

03:57:19.124 --> 03:57:19.925
THE NEED TO VISIT THE COMMUNITY

03:57:19.992 --> 03:57:21.093
IF YOU HAVE AND I KNOW MANY OF

03:57:21.160 --> 03:57:23.596
YOU HAVE BEEN THERE AND SO WE DO

03:57:23.662 --> 03:57:25.431
WE DO TO SEE WHAT EXEMPTIONS.

03:57:25.497 --> 03:57:27.600
WE DON'T FOR THE KINGS ARENA WE

03:57:27.666 --> 03:57:28.701
DO IT.

03:57:28.767 --> 03:57:30.569
FOR DAYS ARENA WHEN THERE'S A

03:57:30.636 --> 03:57:31.604
LOTTA.

03:57:31.670 --> 03:57:34.206
WEALTH IN LOT OF POLITICAL JUICE

03:57:34.273 --> 03:57:36.742
THAT COMES IN AND TESTIFIES IT.

03:57:36.809 --> 03:57:39.078
AND THE SEEMS TO GET DONE.

03:57:39.144 --> 03:57:40.846
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT A COMMUNITY

03:57:40.913 --> 03:57:41.947
OF REALLY POOR PEOPLE.

03:57:42.014 --> 03:57:43.115
WE'RE TALKING ABOUT OTHER

03:57:43.182 --> 03:57:43.782
COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN

03:57:43.849 --> 03:57:46.552
AFFECTED BY ORVILLE WE'VE HAD A

03:57:46.619 --> 03:57:50.255
LOT OF DAMAGE IN OUR AREA AND SO

03:57:50.322 --> 03:57:51.590
I THINK THIS IS A COMMON SENSE

03:57:51.657 --> 03:57:52.691
APPROACH.

03:57:52.758 --> 03:57:53.459
TO GETTING TO WHERE WE WERE

03:57:53.525 --> 03:57:56.428
TRYING TO GO.

03:57:56.495 --> 03:57:57.730
THE SPHERES OF INFLUENCE ARE

03:57:57.796 --> 03:57:58.998
GOING TO BE BUILT IN UNLESS

03:57:59.064 --> 03:58:00.299
THERE IS A PLAN DEVELOPMENT AT

03:58:00.366 --> 03:58:02.201
ARI'S BEEN.

03:58:02.267 --> 03:58:05.371
RATIFIED BY THE LOCAL BOARD OF

03:58:05.437 --> 03:58:06.872
SUPERVISORS OR THE CITY.

03:58:06.939 --> 03:58:09.808
HAS BEEN THROUGH A GENERAL PLAN.

03:58:09.875 --> 03:58:10.476
IT'S YOUR PARTY OR GENERAL PLAN

03:58:10.542 --> 03:58:13.312
SO -- I'M GLAD THAT WE I THINK

03:58:13.379 --> 03:58:14.847
THIS BILL WILL GET OUT HERE

03:58:14.913 --> 03:58:16.482
TODAY WITHOUT TAKING MEMBERS I

03:58:16.548 --> 03:58:17.950

03:58:25.457 --> 03:58:28.394
SOME ROOM VEHICLE MILES TRAVELED

03:58:28.460 --> 03:58:29.561
IS.

03:58:29.628 --> 03:58:30.162
IT'S NOT THE SAME AS WHERE YOU

03:58:30.229 --> 03:58:31.697
HAVE MASS TRANSIT WHERE YOU CAN

03:58:31.764 --> 03:58:34.133
ACTUALLY DO THESE KIND OF THINGS.

03:58:34.199 --> 03:58:35.134

04:00:24.243 --> 04:00:25.978
PERHAPS ON WHAT YOUR VEHICLE

04:00:26.044 --> 04:00:26.812
MILES ARE GOING TO BE BUT YOU

04:00:26.879 --> 04:00:28.113
HAVE NOTHING TO COMPARE IT TO

04:00:28.180 --> 04:00:29.548
CAUSE A REGIONAL THE ANTI HAS

04:00:29.615 --> 04:00:32.551
NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED YET.

04:00:32.618 --> 04:00:34.086
IN.

04:00:34.153 --> 04:00:41.226
YEAH I KNOW THAT'S NOT CAR

04:00:41.293 --> 04:00:43.061
BELONG SEEK WAS.

04:00:43.128 --> 04:00:44.363
YOURS DURING THE SEASON THERE'S

04:00:44.429 --> 04:00:45.330
A THERE'S A LOT OF THIS BUILDING

04:00:45.397 --> 04:00:46.999
NOW DOWN A LOT OF THE TIME TO

04:00:47.065 --> 04:00:50.102
GET. TO THE PLACE WHERE HE'S OUT

04:00:50.169 --> 04:00:50.869
WHERE WE HAVE.

04:00:50.936 --> 04:00:52.337
MAJOR ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS GOING

04:00:52.404 --> 04:00:53.739
NEUTRAL AND I THINK I CAN I

04:00:53.806 --> 04:00:54.807
COMMEND YOU FOR THAT I THINK

04:00:54.873 --> 04:00:56.008
THIS IS A GREAT BILL.

04:00:56.074 --> 04:00:57.109
AND I THINK YOU KNOW WE HAVE A

04:00:57.176 --> 04:00:58.744
HOUSING CRISIS IN CALIFORNIA AND

04:00:58.811 --> 04:00:59.311
I'M NOT GONNA SAY IT'S ALL

04:00:59.378 --> 04:01:00.612
SEQUEL.

04:01:00.679 --> 04:01:01.213
THERE ARE A LOT OF REASONS WHY

04:01:01.280 --> 04:01:01.947
WE HAVE.

04:01:02.014 --> 04:01:03.649
PROBLEMS WITH HOUSING CALIFORNIA

04:01:03.715 --> 04:01:05.450
AND I THINK SEEK WORK IN IS A

04:01:05.517 --> 04:01:06.952
PIECE OF IT BUT THERE ARE MANY

04:01:07.019 --> 04:01:08.320
OTHER THINGS WHICH WE WE KNOW.

04:01:08.387 --> 04:01:09.488
WE ADDRESS THAT BUT WE HAVE

04:01:09.555 --> 04:01:11.190
HOUSING PRICES WE HAVE DISPLACED

04:01:11.256 --> 04:01:12.057
PEOPLE.

04:01:12.124 --> 04:01:13.525
THAT ARE WANTING TO COME BACK TO

04:01:13.592 --> 04:01:14.993
THEIR COMMUNITY AND IT IS WAS A

04:01:15.060 --> 04:01:16.428
DEVASTATING.

04:01:16.495 --> 04:01:18.330
THE FIRE AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN

04:01:18.397 --> 04:01:20.732
GET THIS BILL PASSED AND SIGNED

04:01:20.799 --> 04:01:22.100
BY THE GOVERNOR ND WE CAN BUILD

04:01:22.167 --> 04:01:23.669
SOME HOMES FOR THOSE FOLKS.

04:01:23.735 --> 04:01:25.404
AND LITTLE IN LEGAL THIS YOU SAY

04:01:25.470 --> 04:01:26.705
IS VERY SIGNIFICANT AS ONE ONE

04:01:26.772 --> 04:01:27.606
OF THE ARGUMENTS WE MADE OVER

04:01:27.673 --> 04:01:30.876
AND OVER AGAIN WITH THE BILLS

04:01:30.943 --> 04:01:34.079
THAT WE LET -- THIS COMMITTEE --

04:01:34.146 --> 04:01:35.080
SO I AM NOT A MASTER.

04:01:35.147 --> 04:01:36.448
A VERY QUICKLY -- AS TIME GOES I

04:01:36.515 --> 04:01:37.783
THINK WE'VE AID MOST EXCEPT I

04:01:37.850 --> 04:01:38.851
JUST WANNA MAKE UP.

04:01:38.917 --> 04:01:41.353
A COMPARISON MY CONCERN IS

04:01:41.420 --> 04:01:43.055
CERTAINLY SPRAWL BUT IT'S

04:01:43.121 --> 04:01:44.957
CERTAINLY DENSIFICATION AND THEY

04:01:45.023 --> 04:01:46.325
AMENDMENT THAT WAS SUGGESTING

04:01:46.391 --> 04:01:48.560
HERE IS A HUGE DENSIFICATION OF

04:01:48.627 --> 04:01:50.128
AREAS THAT ARE VERY RURAL IN

04:01:50.195 --> 04:01:51.096
NATURE.

04:01:51.163 --> 04:01:52.598
SO I THINK WE HAVE TO BE SEEKING

04:01:52.664 --> 04:01:54.299
BALANCE BETWEEN THOSE TWO THINGS

04:01:54.366 --> 04:01:55.901
AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT ASSEMBLY

04:01:55.968 --> 04:01:57.369
MEMBER GALLAGHER DID WHEN HE PUT.

04:01:57.436 --> 04:01:59.304
FORTH TAUGHT WHAT HE WOULDLIKE

04:01:59.371 --> 04:02:00.472
TO SEE IN TERMS OF THE MINIMUM

04:02:00.539 --> 04:02:02.841
AND MAXIMUM NUMBER OF ACRE SAND

04:02:02.908 --> 04:02:04.743
THE MINIMUM NUMBER OF UNITS PER

04:02:04.810 --> 04:02:05.310
ACRE.

04:02:05.377 --> 04:02:06.778
WHAT'S IN HERE WE'RE TALKING

04:02:06.845 --> 04:02:09.882
ABOUT -- TWO HUNDRED UNITS ON A

04:02:09.948 --> 04:02:12.184
TEN ACRE PLOT I MEAN THAT GIVES

04:02:12.251 --> 04:02:13.952
YOU OUT ONE TAMPA NACRE THESE

04:02:14.019 --> 04:02:15.554
ARE THESE OF THE STAFF IS

04:02:15.621 --> 04:02:17.222
STACKED FLAT SMALL TOLD FAMILY.

04:02:17.289 --> 04:02:18.991
AND I THINK YOU HAVE TO PROVIDE

04:02:19.057 --> 04:02:20.025
SOME SORT OF A VERY OFTEN I

04:02:20.092 --> 04:02:22.361
THINK THAT'S WHAT HE'S LOOKING.

04:02:22.427 --> 04:02:23.528
FOR A IN THE MANNER IN WHICH

04:02:23.595 --> 04:02:25.264
HE'S APPROACH THERE SO I THINK

04:02:25.330 --> 04:02:26.598
THAT WE SHOULD PASS ADELPHIA'S

04:02:26.665 --> 04:02:27.933
AND HAVE HIM CONTINUE TO WORK

04:02:28.000 --> 04:02:29.368
THROUGH THAT FILL.

04:02:29.434 --> 04:02:31.036
YOUR RELATING YOU'RE RELIEVING

04:02:31.103 --> 04:02:32.604
THE CONCERNS ABOUT SPRAWL BUT AT

04:02:32.671 --> 04:02:34.673
THE SAME TIME YOU'RE PROVIDING

04:02:34.740 --> 04:02:36.341
THE KIND A HABITAT.

04:02:36.408 --> 04:02:37.442
THAT REALLY FOSTERS THE

04:02:37.509 --> 04:02:38.844
OPPORTUNITY FOR FAMILIES WITH

04:02:38.911 --> 04:02:40.445
CHILDREN AS COMPARED TO OUR WORK

04:02:40.512 --> 04:02:47.886
FORCE AND THAT'S REALLY GOOD

04:02:47.953 --> 04:02:48.520
PLANNING AND I THINK HE'S BUILT

04:02:48.587 --> 04:02:49.421
FROM.

04:02:49.488 --> 04:02:50.055
WHICH SEEK WHICH TRIES TO DO AND

04:02:50.122 --> 04:02:51.023
I THINK IN A RATHER ARCHAIC WAY

04:02:51.089 --> 04:02:52.190
FRANKLY A WE SHOULD LET THE

04:02:52.257 --> 04:02:53.926
PLANNER SANDY AND THE CITY.

04:02:53.992 --> 04:02:55.294
AND THERE'S OWNING AND THEIR SUB

04:02:55.360 --> 04:02:56.194
THERE -- SUBDIVISION MAP TRACKS

04:02:56.261 --> 04:02:57.996
ALL OF THAT HAS BEEN PUT IN

04:02:58.063 --> 04:03:00.465
PLACE FOR EONS TO ENSURE THAT WE

04:03:00.532 --> 04:03:02.534

DOES NEED TO BE AMENDED I AS

04:03:05.170 --> 04:03:06.738
TIMES CHANGE BUT NOT TO THE

04:03:06.805 --> 04:03:09.207
DRAMATIC THE THAT'S BEING

04:03:09.274 --> 04:03:10.943
PRESENTED HERE IN THE MEMO SO I

04:03:11.009 --> 04:03:11.810

LOCATIONS A QUALIFY NOT BASED ON

04:03:42.874 --> 04:03:43.909

IS THERE ANYTHING IN THIS BILL

04:04:55.947 --> 04:04:57.949
THAT WOULD REQUIRE DENSER

04:04:58.016 --> 04:05:00.419
DEVELOPMENT IN ANY OF THE SIX

04:05:00.485 --> 04:05:01.586

04:05:06.558 --> 04:05:07.859
IT WOULD REQUIRED.

04:05:07.926 --> 04:05:09.361
DENSER DEVELOPMENT ALTHOUGH IT

04:05:09.428 --> 04:05:11.797
DOES HAVE A MINIMUM DENSITY

04:05:11.863 --> 04:05:13.298
AFFORDABLE AND UNITS PER ACRE.

04:05:13.365 --> 04:05:15.700
AND IT HAS A MAXIMUM ACREAGE OF

04:05:15.767 --> 04:05:17.369
FIFTY ACRES [inaudible]

04:05:17.436 --> 04:05:19.905
NOTWITHSTANDING THE LEAVES

04:05:19.971 --> 04:05:21.139
CERTIFICATION WHICH WOULD

04:05:21.206 --> 04:05:24.376
PRECLUDE THE CITY FROM APPROVING

WELL EVERYTHING THAT WOULD BE

04:06:12.257 --> 04:06:13.592
BUILT UNDER THIS BILL IS BEING

04:06:13.658 --> 04:06:15.660
BUILT TO THE MODERN -- CODE

04:06:34.513 --> 04:06:36.581
CONSIDERED.

04:06:36.648 --> 04:06:37.749
THERE ARE DANGERS POSED BY

04:06:37.816 --> 04:06:41.153
FLOODING OR WILD FIRE HAZARD --

04:06:41.219 --> 04:06:42.354
SO.

TRYING TO EXPEDITE HOUSING.

04:08:37.502 --> 04:08:39.137
IN AREAS THAT WE HAVE ALREADY

04:08:39.204 --> 04:08:41.439
APPROVED -- IN ALL THESE LOW AND

04:08:41.506 --> 04:08:42.574
THAT'S WHY ALL THESE LOCAL

04:08:42.641 --> 04:08:44.776
GOVERNMENT FOLKS GOT UP HERE I

04:08:44.843 --> 04:08:46.478

STAKEHOLDERS THAT I'VE TAKEN A

04:08:49.281 --> 04:08:50.949

04:08:52.484 --> 04:08:54.152
THAT'S HOW COOPERATIVE I'VE BEEN

04:08:54.219 --> 04:08:56.421
FROM DAY -- ONE SO TO ANYBODY'S

04:08:56.488 --> 04:08:57.522
POINT THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN

04:08:57.589 --> 04:08:58.923
WORKING COOPERATIVELY WITH THE

04:08:58.990 --> 04:09:00.392

04:09:00.458 --> 04:09:02.360
THIS IS COORDINATED AND PLANNED

04:09:02.427 --> 04:09:02.694
OUT.

04:09:02.761 --> 04:09:04.396
IT'S JUST NOT TRUE I MEAN THEY

AND I WOULDN'T BE HERE THIS IF I

04:09:12.470 --> 04:09:13.805
HADN'T IF I DIDN'T HAVE THAT RAY

04:09:13.872 --> 04:09:15.974

HADN'T DONE THAT RAY AND SO.

04:09:23.181 --> 04:09:24.482
I THINK ALL THAT SPEAKS TO THIS

04:09:24.549 --> 04:09:25.450
IS A VERY COMPREHENSIVE

04:09:25.517 --> 04:09:27.519

AND I'LL BE A NO ON THIS -- BILL

04:12:24.596 --> 04:12:26.331
BECAUSE I BELIEVE WITH THE

04:12:26.397 --> 04:12:29.167
OPPOSITION THIS IS THIS IS A

04:12:29.234 --> 04:12:32.370

04:12:37.242 --> 04:12:39.143
TAXI CLUB OF WHAT YOU DO IS YOU

04:12:39.210 --> 04:12:41.112
BRING IN THE PUBLIC SO THAT THEY

04:12:41.179 --> 04:12:43.848

04:12:43.915 --> 04:12:45.416
IN ALL THESE COMMUNITIES IS

04:12:47.318 --> 04:12:48.620
JUST IS GOING TO GET BUILT.

04:12:48.686 --> 04:12:50.121

THERE'S WAYS THAT THAT CITIES

04:12:52.524 --> 04:12:56.561
CAN -- ASSIST IF THEY ARE REALLY.

04:12:56.628 --> 04:12:57.996
INTERESTED IN BUILDING THESE NEW

HORRIBLE PRECEDENT TO BE TO BE

04:13:09.307 --> 04:13:11.276

VERY SIGNIFICANT ISSUE IN

SEVEN TO NINE EVERYBODY'S HEAD

04:30:06.957 --> 04:30:07.824
ON MOST THE POINTS.

04:30:07.891 --> 04:30:09.760
THE IMPORTANCE OF A BRIDGE PLAN

04:30:09.826 --> 04:30:12.563
GIVEN THE FACT THAT FROM TWENTY

04:30:12.629 --> 04:30:13.196
THIRTEEN TO TWENTY SIXTEEN THEY

04:30:13.263 --> 04:30:14.898
WERE OUT OF COMPLIANCE TWENTY

04:30:14.965 --> 04:30:15.499
SEVENTEEN THEY CAN EVEN GET A

04:30:15.566 --> 04:30:16.266
PLAN APPROVED.

DIRECTOR HAS SAID VERY

04:30:20.203 --> 04:30:21.772
SPECIFICALLY IF THEY DON'T DO A

04:30:21.838 --> 04:30:22.606
NUMBER OF THINGS.

04:30:22.673 --> 04:30:25.208
THERE WE RELOCATION AND RIGHT

04:30:25.275 --> 04:30:26.343
NOW ONE OF THE BIG REASONS WHY

04:30:26.410 --> 04:30:28.278
THAT PROBABLY WILL NOT HAPPEN IS

04:30:28.345 --> 04:30:29.713
WHAT'S GOING TO HAPPEN IN THE

04:30:29.780 --> 04:30:30.280
SIXTEEN AND A HALF MILLION

04:30:30.347 --> 04:30:31.148

04:30:31.214 --> 04:30:32.316
INFRASTRUCTURE.

04:30:32.382 --> 04:30:33.684
OF THE RECYCLING --

04:30:33.750 --> 04:30:36.086
INFRASTRUCTURE IN CALIFORNIA IF --

04:30:36.153 --> 04:30:36.687
THE STEWARDSHIP ORGANIZATION

04:30:36.753 --> 04:30:38.355
GOES AWAY WE DON'T WANT THEM TO

04:30:38.422 --> 04:30:39.489

LIKE US ON THE BOARD HOW WE LIKE

04:30:41.258 --> 04:30:42.593
FOR CARE TO CONTINUE BUT WE JUST

04:30:42.659 --> 04:30:43.527
THINK THEY SHOULD MOVE FORWARD

04:30:43.594 --> 04:30:43.827
THE GOALS.

04:30:43.894 --> 04:30:45.128
THE SECOND THING.

04:30:45.195 --> 04:30:46.563
THE FEE SHOULD BE REFLECTIVE OF

04:30:46.630 --> 04:30:48.031
WHAT THE INCENTIVE PROGRAM IS

04:30:48.098 --> 04:30:49.633
THE PROGRAM IS DESIGNED TO GET

04:30:49.700 --> 04:30:51.001
CARPET OUT OF LANDFILLS.

04:30:51.068 --> 04:30:54.104
AND IN TO RECYCLE OR REUSE -- TO

04:30:54.171 --> 04:30:55.906

04:30:55.973 --> 04:30:57.007
FITS ALL ASSUMES AN ARC OF

04:30:57.074 --> 04:30:58.575
CARPET IS THE SAME ALL CORPORATE

04:30:58.642 --> 04:30:59.176
IS NOT.

04:30:59.242 --> 04:31:00.611
SOME CARPET IS MORE RECYCLABLE

04:31:00.677 --> 04:31:03.080
THAN OTHERS THIS BILL SIMPLY

04:31:03.146 --> 04:31:04.881
MOVES THE BALL TOWARDS HAVING A

04:31:04.948 --> 04:31:06.283
HIGHER FEE FOR CARPET THAT IS

04:31:06.350 --> 04:31:07.684
HARDER TO RECYCLE AND A LOWER

04:31:07.751 --> 04:31:09.386
FEE FOR CARPET THAT IS EASIER

04:31:09.453 --> 04:31:09.653
RECYCLE.

04:31:09.720 --> 04:31:11.288
WE DON'T THINK THAT'S CONSISTENT

04:31:11.355 --> 04:31:13.056
AND WILL ALLOW FOR A BETTER AND

04:31:13.123 --> 04:31:15.325
MORE PRODUCTIVE PROGRAM AND FOR

04:31:15.392 --> 04:31:23.700

04:33:08.305 --> 04:33:09.506
WHERE WE HAVE CONCERNS IS

04:33:09.573 --> 04:33:10.874
DEALING WITH THE DIFFERENTIAL?

04:33:10.941 --> 04:33:12.642
BACK IN FEBRUARY CAL RECYCLE

04:33:12.709 --> 04:33:14.411
APPROVED THE PLAN.

04:33:14.478 --> 04:33:16.213
THAT WAS SUPPORTED BY THICK

04:33:16.279 --> 04:33:17.714
CARPET ADVISORY COUNCIL.

04:33:17.781 --> 04:33:19.416
THAT CARE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE

04:33:19.483 --> 04:33:21.718
WITHIN A ONE YEAR TIME FRAME TO

04:33:21.785 --> 04:33:24.354
LOOK AT THE POTENTIAL

04:33:24.421 --> 04:33:25.188
DIFFERENTIAL.

04:33:25.255 --> 04:33:25.956
DURING THAT TIME THEY'RE

04:33:26.022 --> 04:33:26.556
SUPPOSED TO WORK WITH

04:33:26.623 --> 04:33:27.657
STAKEHOLDERS THERE'S SUPPOSED TO

04:33:27.724 --> 04:33:28.458
LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS A

04:33:28.525 --> 04:33:29.826
DIFFERENTIAL COULD BE SET UP

04:33:29.893 --> 04:33:31.495
SHOULD BE BASED UPON COSTS

04:33:31.561 --> 04:33:33.296
SHOULD BE BASED UPON FIBER TYPE

04:33:33.363 --> 04:33:34.898
SHOULD BE BASED UPON.

04:33:34.965 --> 04:33:37.434
A RECYCLING SO WHAT WE'RE HERE

04:33:37.501 --> 04:33:39.269
IS WE BELIEVE THAT THAT THAT THE

04:33:39.336 --> 04:33:40.437
CARDS BEFORE THE HORSE HERE.

04:33:40.504 --> 04:33:41.838
MANY TIMES THE COMMITTEE ALWAYS

04:33:41.905 --> 04:33:43.974
WANT TO SEE INFORMATION I THINK

04:33:44.040 --> 04:33:44.975
CENTER STERN SAID EARLIER NOW

04:33:45.041 --> 04:33:46.343
LET'S HAVE INFORMATION BE GIVEN

04:33:46.409 --> 04:33:47.677
TWICE BEFORE BEFORE WE MAKE A

04:33:47.744 --> 04:33:48.745
DECISION.

04:33:48.812 --> 04:33:50.213
SO ARE REQUEST TODAY IS WHY ARE

04:33:50.280 --> 04:33:51.548
WE RUSHING AND MANDATING

04:33:51.615 --> 04:33:53.450
SOMETHING THAT MAYBE MAY NOT

04:33:53.517 --> 04:33:55.318
WORK AFTER INVESTIGATIONAFTER

04:33:55.385 --> 04:33:56.853
ANALYSIS IS BEING DONE WITH CAL

04:33:56.920 --> 04:33:59.256
RECYCLE AND ALSO WITH -- THE

04:33:59.322 --> 04:34:01.024
ADVISORY BOARD WHAT IS THE

04:34:01.091 --> 04:34:02.692
DIFFERENCE IF WE MADE SIX AWAIT

04:34:02.759 --> 04:34:04.494
SIX MONTHS INTO NEXT YEAR UNTIL

04:34:04.561 --> 04:34:05.996
THIS COMMITTEE GETS ALL THE

04:34:06.062 --> 04:34:07.130
INFORMATION.

04:34:07.197 --> 04:34:08.632
LOOKS AT IT AND THEN MAKES A

04:34:08.698 --> 04:34:09.666
DETERMINATION.

04:34:09.733 --> 04:34:11.134
SO WE BELIEVE THAT IS A PROCESS

04:34:11.201 --> 04:34:12.469
THAT SHOULD BE MAINTAIN HERE

04:34:12.536 --> 04:34:13.937
THIS IS THE PROCESS THAT WE WE

04:34:14.004 --> 04:34:15.305
WOULD BE FAIR TO ALL THE PARTIES

04:34:15.372 --> 04:34:16.673
BECAUSE THAT AT THAT TIME YOU

04:34:16.740 --> 04:34:17.674
HAVE ALL THE INFORMATION

04:34:17.741 --> 04:34:19.509
NECESSARY. TO MAKE WE BELIEVE A

04:34:19.576 --> 04:34:21.945
CREDIBLE A DETERMINATION I WOULD

04:34:22.012 --> 04:34:23.547
ALSO SAY THAT I DON'T BELIEVE

04:34:23.613 --> 04:34:24.114
THAT IN THE DRAFTING OF THIS

04:34:24.181 --> 04:34:25.115
AMENDMENT.

04:34:25.182 --> 04:34:26.316
THAT I DON'T THINK THAT THERE

04:34:26.383 --> 04:34:27.384
WERE ANY MEETINGS HELD WAS

04:34:27.450 --> 04:34:29.219
STAKEHOLDERS LIKE THE RETAILERS

04:34:29.286 --> 04:34:30.220
WHO WILL BE VERY AFFECTED BY

04:34:30.287 --> 04:34:31.688
THIS I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S

04:34:31.755 --> 04:34:33.423
ANY CONSIDERATION OF OTHER.

04:34:33.490 --> 04:34:35.125
WAY SIX SET UP THE DIFFERENTIAL

04:34:35.192 --> 04:34:36.259
I DON'T THINK THERE IS A

04:34:36.326 --> 04:34:38.328
DISCUSSION WITH CAL RECYCLE OR

04:34:38.395 --> 04:34:39.930
THE CORPORATE VICE REPORT ABOUT

04:34:39.996 --> 04:34:40.797
WHAT DIFFERENTIAL SHOULD BE IN

04:34:40.864 --> 04:34:41.998
PLACE.

04:34:42.065 --> 04:34:42.699
THEREFORE WE WOULD LIKE TO DEFER

04:34:42.766 --> 04:34:44.601
THIS THE LAST POINT I WOULD MAKE

04:34:44.668 --> 04:34:45.869
IS THAT IS CONCERNED A BRIDGE

04:34:45.936 --> 04:34:47.304
PLAN WE UNDERSTAND A BRIDGE PLAN

04:34:47.370 --> 04:34:49.673
SHOULD BE -- SHOULD BE SET UP

04:34:49.739 --> 04:34:51.274
HOWEVER WE ARE CONCERNED THAT

04:34:51.341 --> 04:34:53.009
WHERE YOU HAVE A PROGRAM AFTER

04:34:53.076 --> 04:34:54.878
ONE YEAR IF CAL RECYCLE CANNOT

04:34:54.945 --> 04:34:56.546
IDENTIFY ANOTHER ENTITY THAT

04:34:56.613 --> 04:34:57.914
THEY'RE ABLE TO TAKE OVER THE

04:34:57.981 --> 04:34:58.915
PROGRAM AND RUN IT.

04:34:58.982 --> 04:35:00.650

PRODUCE MORE NON FLOATING OIL.

04:45:55.438 --> 04:45:57.340
NOT ALL OIL IS THE SAME AND WE

04:45:57.406 --> 04:45:59.609
NEED TO PREPARE DIFFERENTLY FOR

04:45:59.675 --> 04:46:00.910
DIFFERENT TYPES OF SPILLS.

04:46:00.977 --> 04:46:02.345
THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES

04:46:02.411 --> 04:46:03.913

COMMUNITIES AND OUR FRAGILE SAN

04:46:16.726 --> 04:46:18.761

04:46:18.828 --> 04:46:21.030
SEVERELY DAMAGED BY A SPELL OF

04:46:21.097 --> 04:46:22.532
NON FLOODING OIL.

04:46:22.598 --> 04:46:24.200
WHAT DOES THAT DO NOT FLOAT ARE

04:46:24.267 --> 04:46:25.701

IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY SUCH AS

04:46:30.239 --> 04:46:31.707
BILL WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC TO

COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL

04:46:33.476 --> 04:46:34.677

04:46:39.849 --> 04:46:40.349
SPILLS NON FLOATING OIL ARE

NOTORIOUSLY DIFFICULT TO DETECT

04:46:42.752 --> 04:46:44.987

CLEANING THIS BILL ON THE BAY

04:46:58.901 --> 04:47:00.503
WOULD BE FAR MORE CHALLENGING

04:47:00.570 --> 04:47:01.971
THAN ONE CONFINED TO A RIVER BED

04:47:02.038 --> 04:47:04.073
BECAUSE IN THE DAY THIS MATERIAL

04:47:04.140 --> 04:47:06.309

THIS BILL OF NON FLOODING ALSO

04:47:24.493 --> 04:47:26.195
WOULD BE YET ANOTHER IMPACT FOR

04:47:26.262 --> 04:47:27.630
THESE COMMUNITIES TO BEAR.

04:47:27.697 --> 04:47:29.432

THE KIND OF REASONABLE

04:47:39.141 --> 04:47:40.443

THESE TYPES OF ISSUES WE GIVEN

05:07:16.184 --> 05:07:18.286

IT'S AN INFRASTRUCTURAL

05:33:46.005 --> 05:33:46.673

SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE THAT

05:34:13.032 --> 05:34:13.867
DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE GETTING RID

05:34:13.933 --> 05:34:15.568

HAVE WILL BECOME MORE

05:34:22.308 --> 05:34:24.010
SUSTAINABLE -- TRULY RECYCLABLE

05:34:24.077 --> 05:34:25.445
AND WHEN I SAY RECYCLE BUT ONLY

05:34:25.512 --> 05:34:26.045
TECHNICALLY RECYCLING ALLOWED

05:34:26.112 --> 05:34:28.748
BUT RECYCLABLE AND RECYCLED IN

COMPREHENSIVE BRING MY DRESSING

05:35:27.340 --> 05:35:29.042
THE GROWING PROBLEM OF PLASTIC

05:35:29.108 --> 05:35:29.542
POLLUTION ARE OCEAN AND

05:35:29.609 --> 05:35:30.376
WATERWAYS.

05:35:30.443 --> 05:35:31.311
AN INCREASING BODY OF RESEARCH

05:35:31.377 --> 05:35:31.911
IS SHOWING THAT MORE AND MORE

05:35:31.978 --> 05:35:33.279
PLASTIC IS MAKING ITS WAY FROM

05:35:33.346 --> 05:35:34.280
LAND TO SEE.

05:35:34.347 --> 05:35:35.482
IMPACTING THE HEALTH OF OUR

05:35:35.548 --> 05:35:37.183
OCEAN WILDLIFE.

05:35:37.250 --> 05:35:38.184
THAT'S BECAUSE IN ALMOST EVERY

05:35:38.251 --> 05:35:39.819
MARINE HABITAT ON EARTH EVEN ARE

05:35:39.886 --> 05:35:41.554
PROTECTED CALIFORNIA WATERS ARE

05:35:41.621 --> 05:35:43.456
NOT IMMUNE.

05:35:43.523 --> 05:35:45.492
RECENT GALLUP RECENT AQUARIAN

05:35:45.558 --> 05:35:48.094
RESEARCH FOUND PLASTIC PARTICLES.

05:35:48.161 --> 05:35:49.529
THE WATER COLUMN MONTEREY BAY.

05:35:49.596 --> 05:35:50.797
IN THE OCEAN SURFACE TO THE SEA

05:35:50.864 --> 05:35:51.664
FLOOR.

05:35:51.731 --> 05:35:53.366
I RESEARCH ALSO SHOWS THAT THE

05:35:53.433 --> 05:35:54.567
MAJORITY OF THESE PARTICLES ARE

05:35:54.634 --> 05:35:55.902
MADE OF THE SAME TYPES OF

05:35:55.969 --> 05:35:58.605
PLASTIC IN SINGLE USE CONSUMER.

05:35:58.671 --> 05:36:00.206
CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

05:36:00.273 --> 05:36:01.708
IN FACT THE MOST ABUNDANT TYPE

05:36:01.774 --> 05:36:03.576
OF PLASTIC WAS B. E. T. NUMBER

05:36:03.643 --> 05:36:05.311
ONE WHICH IS COMMONLY USED IN

05:36:05.378 --> 05:36:06.379
WATER BOTTLES.

05:36:06.446 --> 05:36:07.780
TAKE OUT CONTAINERS AND PRODUCT

05:36:07.847 --> 05:36:08.915
PACKAGING.

05:36:08.982 --> 05:36:10.550
IT IS CLEAR THAT ARE DISPOSABLE

05:36:10.617 --> 05:36:12.085
SINGLE USE PLASTIC SOCIETY IS A

05:36:12.151 --> 05:36:14.087
MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE PROBLEM

05:36:14.153 --> 05:36:15.455
OF OCEAN PLASTICS SOLUTION.

05:36:15.522 --> 05:36:18.391
POLLUTION SOLUTIONS HERE WE

05:36:18.458 --> 05:36:20.560
ADOPT SOLUTIONS WE HAD UP HERE

05:36:20.627 --> 05:36:21.461
TO COME MODELS FOR THE REST OF

05:36:21.528 --> 05:36:22.962
THE WORLD AND NO OTHER STATE IS

05:36:23.029 --> 05:36:24.330
BETTER POSITIONED TO LEAD IN

CALIFORNIA.

05:36:25.899 --> 05:36:27.233
THIS BILL IS A MAJOR STEP

PRIOR STATE AND FOR A PLANET.

05:36:31.738 --> 05:36:32.171
IT WILL HELP ACCELERATE

05:36:32.238 --> 05:36:33.439
INNOVATION AND REDUCE THE AMOUNT

05:36:33.506 --> 05:36:34.207
OF WASTE GENERATED IN SINGLE USE

05:36:34.274 --> 05:36:35.875
PLASTIC.

ADDRESSES THE SCALE OF THE

05:36:41.247 --> 05:36:42.482
PROBLEM.

05:36:42.549 --> 05:36:43.816
AT THE AQUARIUM WE BELIEVE

05:36:43.883 --> 05:36:45.285

THROUGHOUT OUR LONG HISTORY OF

05:36:49.155 --> 05:36:50.657
WORKING WITH INDUSTRY ON OCEAN

05:36:50.723 --> 05:36:52.358
CONSERVATION ISSUES WE'VE

05:36:52.425 --> 05:36:53.927
LEARNED THAT COLLECTIVE ACTION.

05:36:53.993 --> 05:36:55.495

WE HAVE MADE SOME PUBLIC

05:41:44.784 --> 05:41:46.552
STATEMENTS.

05:41:46.619 --> 05:41:48.287
THE INDUSTRY'S COMMITMENT TO

05:41:49.355 --> 05:41:52.091

RECYCLABILITY COULD POSSIBILITY

05:41:53.092 --> 05:41:54.727
OF OF PLASTIC PACKAGING SO WE

05:41:54.794 --> 05:41:56.896

ALLEN SOMETHING AMERICANS

05:41:58.431 --> 05:41:58.965
OFFICES.

05:41:59.031 --> 05:42:02.235
LONG TERM VISION I THINK WHERE

05:42:02.301 --> 05:42:04.103
WE HAVE SOME CONCERNS.

05:42:04.170 --> 05:42:04.670
IS HOW THE BILL AS CURRENTLY

05:42:04.737 --> 05:42:06.572
DRAFTED AND SOME OF THE ELEMENTS

05:42:06.639 --> 05:42:07.974
THAT ARE THERE IN THE BILL.

05:42:08.040 --> 05:42:09.408
IN A COUPLE OF AREAS I WANT TO

05:42:09.475 --> 05:42:10.877
HIGHLIGHT ONE IS.

05:42:10.943 --> 05:42:12.111
THE BILL'S.

05:42:12.178 --> 05:42:13.913
IN OUR READ A COMPLETE

05:42:13.980 --> 05:42:15.314
DELEGATION OF AUTHORITY TAKE OUR

05:42:15.381 --> 05:42:17.817
CYCLE TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTING

05:42:17.884 --> 05:42:20.620
REGULATIONS -- TO REACH THESE

05:42:20.686 --> 05:42:22.221
GOALS AND THAT MAKES US FRANKLY

05:42:22.288 --> 05:42:24.023
A LITTLE NERVOUS AS TO THE POWER

05:42:24.090 --> 05:42:25.825
THEY CAL RECYCLE HAVE.

05:42:25.892 --> 05:42:27.193
OVER THE PACKAGING INDUSTRY

05:42:27.260 --> 05:42:28.527
WHETHER OR NOT THE BILL WOULD

05:42:28.594 --> 05:42:30.730
ALLOW THEM TO ARBITRARILY PICK

05:42:30.796 --> 05:42:32.632
AND CHOOSE WINNERS AND LOSERS IN

05:42:32.698 --> 05:42:34.600
THE MARKET PLACE SAID -- RECYCLE

05:42:34.667 --> 05:42:36.369
CONTENT STANDARDS IN ALL THIS

05:42:36.435 --> 05:42:37.737
AUTHORITIES DELEGATED.

05:42:37.803 --> 05:42:40.006
OVER THE COUNTER CYCLE SO THAT.

05:42:40.072 --> 05:42:41.374
IS CERTAINLY.

05:42:41.440 --> 05:42:42.174
AN AREA WHERE WE HAVE SOME

05:42:42.241 --> 05:42:43.376
CONCERNS.

05:42:43.442 --> 05:42:44.410
THE SECOND POINT I WANT TO RAISE

05:42:44.477 --> 05:42:46.812
IS THAT WE HAVE SUGGESTED THAT

05:42:46.879 --> 05:42:48.648
BEFORE THE BILL OR SET

05:42:48.714 --> 05:42:50.283
ESTABLISHES SOME INTERIM

05:42:50.349 --> 05:42:51.484
BENCHMARKS.

05:42:51.550 --> 05:42:53.052
FOR PACKAGING RECYCLING RATES IN

05:42:53.119 --> 05:42:54.954
COMPOSTING RATES THAT MUCH MORE

05:42:55.021 --> 05:42:56.956
INFORMATION IS NEEDED FROM CAL

05:42:57.023 --> 05:42:58.824
RECYCLE IN TERMS OF A VERY

05:42:58.891 --> 05:43:00.626
DETAILED SCOPING PLAN OF THE

05:43:00.693 --> 05:43:01.861
STATE'S EXISTING WASTE

05:43:01.928 --> 05:43:03.195
COLLECTION INFRASTRUCTURE.

05:43:03.262 --> 05:43:06.499
PROCESSING CAPABILITIES WHAT MAY

05:43:06.565 --> 05:43:07.967
BE NECESSARY.

05:43:08.034 --> 05:43:09.568
TO BUT MAYBE NEEDED IN TERMS OF

05:43:09.635 --> 05:43:11.704
UPGRADES TO THOSE TO THOSE TO

05:43:11.771 --> 05:43:12.972
THE STATE'S INFRASTRUCTURE TO

05:43:13.039 --> 05:43:16.042
GET TO THESE TO THESE. TO THESE.

05:43:16.108 --> 05:43:16.809
BENCHMARKS THAT THE BILL

05:43:16.876 --> 05:43:18.477
ESTABLISHES SO WE THINK MUCH

05:43:18.544 --> 05:43:20.913
MORE INFORMATION IS NEEDED TO

05:43:20.980 --> 05:43:22.281
HELP INFORM WHAT THOSE.

05:43:22.348 --> 05:43:25.084
INTERIM GOALS MAY BE TO GET TO

05:43:25.151 --> 05:43:28.587
TO GET TO THE 75% THRESHOLD.

05:43:28.654 --> 05:43:29.588
AND WE ALSO THINK THERE NEEDS TO

05:43:29.655 --> 05:43:31.490
BE SOME FLEXIBILITY IN THOSE

05:43:31.557 --> 05:43:32.959
STANDARDS.

05:43:33.025 --> 05:43:34.527
BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY THIRTY

05:43:34.593 --> 05:43:37.596
BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

05:43:37.663 --> 05:43:39.098
NEW TECHNOLOGIES THAT CAME MAY

05:43:39.165 --> 05:43:41.033
COME ON THE MARKET PLACE IN

05:43:41.100 --> 05:43:41.867
TERMS OF PROCESSING THIS

05:43:41.934 --> 05:43:42.134
MATERIAL.

05:43:42.201 --> 05:43:45.938
SO. FOR INSTANCE ESTABLISHING A

05:43:46.005 --> 05:43:49.075
20% RECYCLING RATE BY TWENTY

05:43:49.141 --> 05:43:50.309
TWENTY FOUR AND A A PACKAGING

05:43:50.376 --> 05:43:52.979
MATERIAL MAY GET 219% BUT AS THE

05:43:53.045 --> 05:43:54.413
WAY THE BILL'S CURRENTLY DRAFTED

05:43:54.480 --> 05:43:55.815
THERE'S A CONDITION OF SALE IF

05:43:55.881 --> 05:43:57.316
YOU DON'T REACH 20% OF YOUR ME

05:43:57.383 --> 05:43:58.384
THE OFF THE MARKET PLACE.

05:43:58.451 --> 05:44:00.052
WHY I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SOME

05:44:00.119 --> 05:44:02.288
SOME FLEXIBILITY?

05:44:02.355 --> 05:44:04.090
IN THAT WE ALSO THINK THAT.

05:44:04.156 --> 05:44:06.692
THE BILL NEEDS TO LOOK AT HOW TO

05:44:06.759 --> 05:44:08.260
DEAL WITH SOME OF THE REGULATORY

05:44:08.327 --> 05:44:09.128
DUPLICATION THAT WE SEE COMING

05:44:09.195 --> 05:44:10.763
DOWN BECAUSE THERE'S CURRENTLY

05:44:10.830 --> 05:44:12.498
THE BOTTLE BILLS COMMITTEE KNOWS

05:44:12.565 --> 05:44:13.399
THERE'S CAL RECYCLING COMMENCE

05:44:13.466 --> 05:44:14.734
THE RIGID PLASTIC PACKAGING

05:44:14.800 --> 05:44:15.668
CONTAINER LAW.

05:44:15.735 --> 05:44:16.902
SO I THINK WE NEED TO HAVE SINCE

05:44:16.969 --> 05:44:19.005
CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE AVOID

05:44:19.071 --> 05:44:21.073
UNNECESSARY.

05:44:21.140 --> 05:44:23.376
REGULATORY DUPLICATION.

05:44:23.442 --> 05:44:24.910
WE'VE PUT TOGETHER SOME.

05:44:24.977 --> 05:44:25.911
COMPREHENSIVE AMENDMENTS OF

05:44:25.978 --> 05:44:27.847
SHARED WAS SENT ROUNDS FOLKS AND

05:44:27.913 --> 05:44:31.417
AND AND MACHINES ALSO SPOKE TO

05:44:31.484 --> 05:44:32.051
TO TRY TO ADDRESS SOME OF THESE

05:44:32.118 --> 05:44:32.685
ISSUES.

05:44:32.752 --> 05:44:34.987
AND WE THINK IT'S A GOOD WAY TO

05:44:35.054 --> 05:44:36.856
GET. TO THE OBJECTIVE THAT WE'RE

05:44:36.922 --> 05:44:38.190
TRYING TO ACHIEVE AND AT THE END

05:44:38.257 --> 05:44:39.792
OF REASONABLE AND REALISTIC

05:44:39.859 --> 05:44:41.727
FASHION.

05:44:41.794 --> 05:44:44.230
I WILL TOUCH ON ONE ONE ASPECT

05:44:44.296 --> 05:44:45.297
OF THE PROVISIONS THAT WE'VE

05:44:45.364 --> 05:44:47.333
SUGGESTED THAT I I CAN'T SPEAK

05:44:47.400 --> 05:44:48.567
FOR ANY OF THE OTHER FOLKS AND

05:44:48.634 --> 05:44:50.603
THE COALITION SUPPOSING THE BILL

05:44:50.669 --> 05:44:52.071
BUT WE HAVE SUGGESTED.

05:44:52.138 --> 05:44:55.674
A AN ADVANCE RECYCLING FEE.

05:44:55.741 --> 05:44:56.208
FOR SOME OF OUR PACKAGING

05:44:56.275 --> 05:44:58.411
PRODUCERS THOSE THAT ARE

05:44:58.477 --> 05:45:00.413
PREDOMINANTLY IN THE TAKE OUT

05:45:00.479 --> 05:45:02.515
FOOD SERVICE PACKAGING ARENA.

05:45:02.581 --> 05:45:05.751
THAT ARE TRADITIONALLY.

05:45:05.818 --> 05:45:07.720
HELD UP AS EXAMPLES OF MARINE

05:45:07.787 --> 05:45:09.622
DEBRIS AND LITTER WHICH WE THINK

05:45:09.688 --> 05:45:11.090
WOULD BE A SIGNIFICANT

05:45:11.157 --> 05:45:13.759
CONTRIBUTOR TOWARD HELPING.

GETTING A HANDLE ON OUR WASTE

05:53:54.079 --> 05:53:56.014
SOLUTION TO THIS PROBLEM THAT

05:53:56.081 --> 05:53:58.483
CAN BE SOLD AND SCALED. TO THE

05:53:58.550 --> 05:53:59.785
REST THE WORLD.

05:53:59.851 --> 05:54:01.453
AND WHAT I SAID EVERYBODY LAST

05:54:01.520 --> 05:54:02.821
WEEK WAS THAT I ACTUALLY THINK

05:54:02.888 --> 05:54:03.555
THAT WE WOULD HAVE I WOULD

05:54:03.622 --> 05:54:04.957
CONSIDER THIS WHOLE EFFORT TO

05:54:05.023 --> 05:54:06.758
HAVE BEEN A FAILURE.

05:54:06.825 --> 05:54:08.994
IF WE DON'T CROSS SOMETHING THAT --

05:54:09.061 --> 05:54:10.996
THAT THAT OTHER JURISDICTIONS

05:54:11.063 --> 05:54:12.864
OTHER STATES OTHER NATIONS WANT

05:54:12.931 --> 05:54:16.134
TO REPLICATE -- AND THE ONLY WAY

05:54:16.201 --> 05:54:17.169
THAT WE DO THAT IS IF WE DO

05:54:17.235 --> 05:54:18.270
SOMETHING THAT IS BOTH

05:54:18.337 --> 05:54:19.638
MEANINGFUL IN TERMS OF REAL

05:54:19.705 --> 05:54:20.906
WASTE REDUCTION.

05:54:20.973 --> 05:54:23.742
AND ECONOMICALLY FEASIBLE.

05:54:23.809 --> 05:54:24.376
I BECAUSE OF THE JURISDICTIONS

05:54:24.443 --> 05:54:25.410
ARE GOING TO DO IT IF THEY SEE

05:54:25.477 --> 05:54:26.612
THISIS SOMETHING THAT'S GOING

05:54:26.678 --> 05:54:28.313
TO HARM THEIR ECONOMIES BECAUSE

05:54:28.380 --> 05:54:29.648
THE END OF THE DAY WE CAN BE WE

05:54:29.715 --> 05:54:30.682
HAVE THE MOST GREEN POLICIES IN

05:54:30.749 --> 05:54:32.451
THE WORLD BUT IF WE'RE NOT ABLE.

05:54:32.517 --> 05:54:33.285
TO GET OTHER FOLKS TO ADOPT

05:54:33.352 --> 05:54:35.120

05:54:36.521 --> 05:54:37.255
DIFFERENCE WE NEED TO MAKE FOR

OUR CHILDREN -- AND AND THIS IS

05:54:39.324 --> 05:54:41.059
ONE OF THOSE AREAS ARE WE HAVE

05:54:41.126 --> 05:54:43.729
TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE -- BECAUSE

05:54:43.795 --> 05:54:45.364

05:54:45.430 --> 05:54:46.231
THE CURRENT.

05:54:46.298 --> 05:54:48.467
APPROACH IS IS IS FINALLY AT THE

05:54:48.533 --> 05:54:50.102
STATE LEVEL.

05:54:50.168 --> 05:54:52.671
