00:37:13.965 --> 00:37:16.634
HER COMMENTS AS CHAIR.

00:37:16.701 --> 00:37:19.837
PLEASE YEAH I DON'T WANNA HEAR

00:37:19.904 --> 00:37:21.839
SOME DETAILS ABOUT THE YOUR YOUR

00:37:21.906 --> 00:37:24.976
YOUR MULTI CRITERIA SCREENING --

00:37:25.042 --> 00:37:27.645
MEASURES SO --

00:37:27.712 --> 00:37:30.648
HALL RECORDS OF WHAT IT IS.

00:37:30.715 --> 00:37:33.751
SO WE USE THE A STUDY THAT WAS

00:37:33.818 --> 00:37:35.119
DONE BY THE CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE.

00:37:35.186 --> 00:37:37.221
AND WE LOOK AT THEIR STUDENTS

00:37:37.288 --> 00:37:38.956
OVERALL GPA SO YOU'RE LOOKING AT

00:37:39.023 --> 00:37:43.728
ENGLISH PSYCHOLOGY --

00:37:43.794 --> 00:37:44.829
NUTRITION NUTRITION NOW THEY

00:37:44.895 --> 00:37:46.163
TAKE CONTRITION WELL SOME

00:37:46.230 --> 00:37:49.100
SCHOOLS DO NUTRITION SO AND AT

00:37:49.166 --> 00:37:50.735
LIKE ANTHROPOLOGY OR SOCIOLOGY

00:37:50.801 --> 00:37:52.870
SO THAT'S ONE CATEGORY THEN IN A

00:37:52.937 --> 00:37:54.739
SEPARATE CATEGORY YOU HAVE YOUR

00:37:54.805 --> 00:37:57.942
SCIENCES WHICH IS MICROBIOLOGY --

00:37:58.009 --> 00:37:59.677
ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY AND WE

00:37:59.744 --> 00:38:01.946
KNOW THAT FOR THAT IF A STUDENT

00:38:02.013 --> 00:38:03.347
GETS A B. AVERAGE A THREE POINT

00:38:03.414 --> 00:38:05.182
NO IN THOSE THREE CLASSES

00:38:05.249 --> 00:38:06.851
WHETHER IT'S DONE BY GETTING ALL

00:38:06.917 --> 00:38:09.387
BEES OR IN A A C. A B..

00:38:09.453 --> 00:38:10.721
IT DOESN'T SEEM TO MATTER BUT IF

00:38:10.788 --> 00:38:12.890
THEY HIT THAT BE AVERAGE.

00:38:12.957 --> 00:38:14.425
THAT THEN THEIR CHANCES OF

00:38:14.492 --> 00:38:15.726
COMPLETING THE PROGRAM AND

00:38:15.793 --> 00:38:16.927
PASSING AND COLLECTS IS

00:38:16.994 --> 00:38:18.396
SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER.

00:38:18.462 --> 00:38:19.997
SO AT SACRAMENTO CITY COLLEGE

00:38:20.064 --> 00:38:21.032
I'M NOT SURE ABOUT DELTA BUT

00:38:21.098 --> 00:38:22.099
MOST OF THE SCHOOLS DO IT THE

00:38:22.166 --> 00:38:24.802
SAME WE GIVE POINTS --

00:38:24.869 --> 00:38:26.270
FOR BEING A VETERAN WE GIVE

00:38:26.337 --> 00:38:29.173
POINTS --

00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:30.675
FOR SPEAKING A SECOND LANGUAGE

00:38:30.741 --> 00:38:32.009
HARDSHIP WHICH MOST OF OUR

00:38:32.076 --> 00:38:34.078
STUDENTS TO HAVE HARDSHIP AND WE

00:38:34.145 --> 00:38:36.380
DEFINE THAT VERY BROADLY --

00:38:36.447 --> 00:38:38.849
JUST DEPENDING FIRST GENERATION

00:38:38.916 --> 00:38:42.753
GOING LOW INCOME --

00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:43.320
THEY GET POINTS IF THEY HAVE

00:38:43.387 --> 00:38:45.856
ANOTHER LIFE IN A RESTAURANT

00:38:45.923 --> 00:38:47.558
THERAPIST OR YOU'VE BEEN A FULL

00:38:47.625 --> 00:38:48.993
BOTTOM MISSED YOU GET ADDITIONAL

00:38:49.060 --> 00:38:50.761
POINTS FOR THAT AND THEN WE USE

00:38:50.828 --> 00:38:52.363
THE TEAS TEST ARE YOU FAMILIAR

00:38:52.430 --> 00:38:54.498
WITH THAT.

00:38:54.565 --> 00:38:56.634
SO IT'S A ED TEST THAT

00:38:56.701 --> 00:38:59.603
DETERMINES BASIC PROFICIENCY IN

00:38:59.670 --> 00:39:01.439
READING AND SCIENCE AND MATH.

00:39:01.505 --> 00:39:04.175
AND WE EVERY SCHOOL HAS A WAY

00:39:04.241 --> 00:39:06.610
THAT A STUDENT CAN REMEDIATE

00:39:06.677 --> 00:39:08.012
THEIR TEAS TEST THAT HAS TO BE

00:39:08.079 --> 00:39:09.313
PUT IN PLACE.

00:39:09.380 --> 00:39:11.215
BUT THAT TEST HELPS TO KNOW THAT

00:39:11.282 --> 00:39:14.085
THE STUDENT IS PREPARED FOR THE

00:39:14.151 --> 00:39:15.419
AMOUNT OF READING THAT GOES ON

00:39:15.486 --> 00:39:17.354
WE MIGHT ASK THE STUDENT TO READ

00:39:17.421 --> 00:39:18.723
A HUNDRED PAGES A WEEK.

00:39:18.789 --> 00:39:20.991
EASILY AND SO THEY HAVE TO BE

00:39:21.058 --> 00:39:22.326
ABLE TO READ AND COMPREHEND THAT

00:39:22.393 --> 00:39:24.895
INFORMATION AND THE TEAS TEST IS

00:39:24.962 --> 00:39:26.464
ONE WAY FOR THEM TO DETERMINE IF

00:39:26.530 --> 00:39:28.065
THEY NEED TO TAKE AN ADDITIONAL

00:39:28.132 --> 00:39:30.601
READING CLASS OR IF THEY NEED --

00:39:30.668 --> 00:39:32.636
TO STUDY UP ON MATH OR SCIENCE

00:39:32.703 --> 00:39:33.471
BEFORE THEY COME INTO THE

00:39:33.537 --> 00:39:35.206
PROGRAM SO THAT WHEN THEY COME

00:39:35.272 --> 00:39:36.807
INTO OUR FIRST SEMESTER THEY ARE

00:39:36.874 --> 00:39:38.943
PREPARED FOR THE THE RIGOR AND

00:39:39.009 --> 00:39:40.244
THE ANATOMY AND PHYSIOLOGY

00:39:40.311 --> 00:39:40.978
BASICS.

00:39:41.045 --> 00:39:42.747
THAT HAVE TO BE KNOWN TO BUILD

00:39:42.813 --> 00:39:44.782
ON TOP OF THAT DOES THAT EXPLAIN

00:39:44.849 --> 00:39:45.449
IT TO YOU.

00:39:45.516 --> 00:39:47.885
YES IS THIS SO.

00:39:47.952 --> 00:39:49.787
MUCH THAT CRITERIA SCREENING

00:39:49.854 --> 00:39:51.455
MANAGER IS --

00:39:51.522 --> 00:39:53.190
THRALL THE OLD.

00:39:53.257 --> 00:39:55.659
A COMMUNITY COLLEGES SO WITH A

00:39:55.726 --> 00:39:57.828
NURSING PROGRAMS.

00:39:57.895 --> 00:39:59.196
WHAT A STORY OF THEM --

00:39:59.263 --> 00:40:01.098
AND SOME ARE IN THE PROCESS OF

00:40:01.165 --> 00:40:03.167
INSTITUTING IT RIGHT NOW --

00:40:03.234 --> 00:40:04.735
THE SMALLER COLLEGES WHERE THEY

00:40:04.802 --> 00:40:05.903
HAVE LESS RESOURCES YOU HAVE TO

00:40:05.970 --> 00:40:08.506
DO A STUDY AT TO SAY THESE ARE

00:40:08.572 --> 00:40:10.674
THE FACTORS THAT WE CAN PUT IN

00:40:10.741 --> 00:40:12.910
PLACE RELATED TO THE ENVIRONMENT

00:40:12.977 --> 00:40:13.644
AROUND OUR COLLEGE AND WHAT

00:40:13.711 --> 00:40:14.411
EFFECTS IT.

00:40:14.478 --> 00:40:15.913
SO SOME OF THE SMALLER SCHOOLS

00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:19.183
IS THEY DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES

00:40:19.250 --> 00:40:22.319
TO DO IT BUT AS MORE COMMUNITY

00:40:22.386 --> 00:40:23.954
COLLEGES HAVE PUT THIS IN PLACE.

00:40:24.021 --> 00:40:25.790
EVERYBODY IS ON BOARD ALL OF

00:40:25.856 --> 00:40:27.491
THEM ARE WILL HAVE INSTITUTED

00:40:27.558 --> 00:40:28.325
EVENTUALLY.

00:40:28.392 --> 00:40:30.461
OBVIOUSLY I WERE TO SUPPORT THE

00:40:30.528 --> 00:40:32.163
IS -- A. B.

00:40:32.229 --> 00:40:32.963
TWO THIRTY NINE BUT UP BY

00:40:33.030 --> 00:40:35.900
PASSING THIS MANAGER --

00:40:35.966 --> 00:40:37.802
WOULD IT THE MANDATE THOUGHT ALL

00:40:37.868 --> 00:40:42.072
THE COMMIT COLLEGES SO TO COMPLY.

00:40:42.139 --> 00:40:43.274
NO THERE'S NO MANDATE AND THE

00:40:43.340 --> 00:40:47.278
BILL IT'S IT'S IT'S OPTIONAL FOR

00:40:47.344 --> 00:40:49.713
DISTRICTS TO UTILIZE THIS.

00:40:49.780 --> 00:40:51.115
SO THAT WAY I BELIEVE WAS FORTY

00:40:51.182 --> 00:40:53.918
MATTER WAS THE VALUE OF THIS

00:40:53.984 --> 00:40:55.352
TODAY THAN IF WE DO PASS.

00:40:55.419 --> 00:40:57.254
SO I THINK TO ANSWER YOUR

00:40:57.321 --> 00:40:58.789
PREVIOUS QUESTION I BELIEVE THIS

00:40:58.856 --> 00:41:01.091
IS AN FORTY TWO OF THE NURSING

00:41:01.158 --> 00:41:01.859
FORTY TWO NURSING PROGRAMS

00:41:01.926 --> 00:41:04.228
CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTED AM CST.

00:41:04.295 --> 00:41:05.763
AND WHAT IT DOES IS BASICALLY

00:41:05.830 --> 00:41:08.132
DESIGNED TO ALLOW THOSE STUDENTS

00:41:08.199 --> 00:41:08.999
TO HAVE THE MOST SUCCESS IN

00:41:09.066 --> 00:41:10.801
ACTUALLY GRADUATING FROM THESE

00:41:10.868 --> 00:41:11.936
NURSING PROGRAMS BECAUSE THEY'RE

00:41:12.002 --> 00:41:13.037
SO IMPACTED.

00:41:13.103 --> 00:41:14.305
YOU'VE SEEN THE RISE AND HEALTH

00:41:14.371 --> 00:41:15.573
CARE AND HEALTH CARE NEEDS

00:41:15.639 --> 00:41:16.640
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE STATE OF

00:41:16.707 --> 00:41:17.274
SURE.

00:41:17.341 --> 00:41:18.509
IN YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL AND SO

00:41:18.576 --> 00:41:19.910
WITH THIS CRITERIA DOES IS IT

00:41:19.977 --> 00:41:21.212
ALLOWS A LOCAL COMMUNITY

00:41:21.278 --> 00:41:24.215
COLLEGES TO UTILIZE AM CST SO WE

00:41:24.281 --> 00:41:24.682
CAN.

00:41:24.748 --> 00:41:26.817
HAVE HIGH GRADUATION RATES FOR

00:41:26.884 --> 00:41:28.118
THESE NURSING PROGRAMS AND

00:41:28.185 --> 00:41:29.320
FULFILL THAT NEED THAT WE ALL

00:41:29.386 --> 00:41:30.688
HAVE IN ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES

00:41:30.754 --> 00:41:32.389
UP AND DOWN THE ENTIRE STATE.

00:41:32.456 --> 00:41:33.724
AND THIS IS WHAT THIS BILL WILL

00:41:33.791 --> 00:41:34.925
CONTINUE TO ALLOW THOSE

00:41:34.992 --> 00:41:36.327
COMMUNITY COLLEGES TO DEVELOP

00:41:36.393 --> 00:41:37.862
THE M. C. S. T. PROGRAM IF THEY

00:41:37.928 --> 00:41:39.663
HAVEN'T DONE SO ALREADY.

00:41:39.730 --> 00:41:41.265
AND FOR THOSE COLLEGES THAT HAVE

00:41:41.332 --> 00:41:44.101
IT TO CONTINUE TO OUR HEALTH

00:41:44.168 --> 00:41:46.403
CARE NEEDS THROUGHOUT THE STATE.

00:41:46.470 --> 00:41:47.872
YES SENSE OF THIS SOUNDS GOOD

00:41:47.938 --> 00:41:49.540
THAT AND ARE NOT A SURE THAT THE

00:41:49.607 --> 00:41:50.941
GRADUATION RATE THE WOULD BE

00:41:51.008 --> 00:41:52.076
HIGH.

00:41:52.142 --> 00:41:53.978
BECAUSE ALL WHILE WE IF WE MAKE

00:41:54.044 --> 00:41:55.079
IT --

00:41:55.145 --> 00:41:56.647
MANDATED HELPFUL.

00:41:56.714 --> 00:41:58.515
MANY COLLEGES WITH THE NURSING

00:41:58.582 --> 00:42:01.285
PROGRAM SO WARMLY --

00:42:01.352 --> 00:42:02.620
GIVE THEM ANY HARDSHIP.

00:42:02.686 --> 00:42:04.355
NO I THINK WHAT YOU'RE HEARING

00:42:04.421 --> 00:42:06.590
FROM EVERYONE IN SUPPORT IS WERE

00:42:06.657 --> 00:42:07.791
ALLOWING EACH OF THE COMMUNITY

00:42:07.858 --> 00:42:09.193
COLLEGES --

00:42:09.260 --> 00:42:10.194
TO MOVE ALONG THIS PATH AND

00:42:10.261 --> 00:42:11.428
THAT'S WHAT THEY'RE DOING

00:42:11.495 --> 00:42:12.296
THEY'RE CONTINUING TO MOVE THAT

00:42:12.363 --> 00:42:14.098
WAY THE PROGRAM STARTED WITH A

00:42:14.164 --> 00:42:15.532
FEW COMMUNITY COLLEGES IT'S

00:42:15.599 --> 00:42:16.934
GROWN TO FORTY TWO NOW.

00:42:17.001 --> 00:42:19.503
AND WE'RE HOPING IT'LL GO --

00:42:19.570 --> 00:42:20.905
THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE.

00:42:20.971 --> 00:42:22.206
DROWNED THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE

00:42:22.273 --> 00:42:23.607
SYSTEM AND SO THAT'S WHAT WE'RE

00:42:23.674 --> 00:42:24.408
HOPING WE DID NOT WANT TO

00:42:24.475 --> 00:42:26.610
MANDATE IT BUT WE WANTED ALLOW.

00:42:26.677 --> 00:42:28.212
THE FLEXIBILITY FOR THOSE

00:42:28.279 --> 00:42:29.480

01:05:36.365 --> 01:05:37.300
CURRENT AMOUNT.

01:05:37.366 --> 01:05:38.367
AND FINALLY --

01:05:38.434 --> 01:05:39.435
IT SHOULD BE NO SURPRISE THAT IN

01:05:39.502 --> 01:05:41.237
CALIFORNIA WE LEAD THE NATION

01:05:41.304 --> 01:05:42.805

DEBT AN IMPORTANT FIGURE THAT

01:05:50.413 --> 01:05:51.881

WHO HOLDS THE DEBT IN CALIFORNIA

01:05:54.183 --> 01:05:55.685

ONE FORTY AB ONE FORTY IS

01:07:37.653 --> 01:07:39.088
IMPORTANT TO ME AND TO USE THE

01:07:39.155 --> 01:07:40.389
ESSAY BECAUSE IT ENSURES THAT

01:07:40.456 --> 01:07:41.724
FINANCIALLY VULNERABLE STUDENT

01:07:41.791 --> 01:07:43.025

STUDENT LOANS.

01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:45.394
AND HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

01:07:45.461 --> 01:07:46.762
SUCCEED AND THE POST GRADUATE

01:07:46.829 --> 01:07:48.464
LIFE THE COST OF ATTENDING

01:07:48.531 --> 01:07:49.665
COLLEGE IS MORE THAN TUITION

01:07:49.732 --> 01:07:51.167
ALONE AS IT INCLUDES COSTS FOR

01:07:51.233 --> 01:07:53.969
FOOD AND HOUSING. 44% OF YOU SEE

01:07:54.036 --> 01:07:55.538
UNDERGRADUATES ARE FACING FOOD

01:07:55.604 --> 01:07:56.906
AND SECURITY AND THESE COSTS CAN

01:07:56.972 --> 01:07:58.474
LEAD STUDENTS TO TAKE OUT

01:07:58.541 --> 01:07:59.442
STUDENT LOANS.

01:07:59.508 --> 01:08:00.643
ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE

01:08:00.709 --> 01:08:02.344
FACTS FROM STUDENT DEBT AT THE

01:08:02.411 --> 01:08:02.945
UC.

01:08:03.012 --> 01:08:04.513
NEARLY THREE OUT OF EVERY FIVE

01:08:04.580 --> 01:08:06.148
YOU SEE STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH

01:08:06.215 --> 01:08:07.750
SOME LEVELS OF STUDENT LOAN DEBT.

01:08:07.817 --> 01:08:09.151
THE AVERAGE STUDENT LOAN DEBT AT

01:08:09.218 --> 01:08:12.388
THE UC DOLLARS.

01:08:12.455 --> 01:08:14.089
MOST CONCERNING BELOW IS CAN THE

01:08:14.156 --> 01:08:15.891
LOWEST INCOME STUDENTS AT THE UC

01:08:15.958 --> 01:08:17.193
GRADUATE WITH THE MOST AMOUNT AT

01:08:17.259 --> 01:08:18.494
THAT AT TIMES WOULD NEARLY

01:08:18.561 --> 01:08:19.795
DOUBLE OR TRIPLE.

01:08:19.862 --> 01:08:21.897
THE AMOUNT OF DEBT THAN THAT OF

01:08:21.964 --> 01:08:23.332
THE HIGHER INCOME COUNTERPARTS.

01:08:23.399 --> 01:08:25.301
CITY LET STUDENT LOAN DEBT ALSO

01:08:25.367 --> 01:08:26.869

STUDENTS GRADUATE WITH THAT

01:08:40.049 --> 01:08:41.717
WHICH IS A STAGGERING NUMBER AND

01:08:41.784 --> 01:08:42.985
I BELIEVE THAT AB ONE FORTY WILL

01:08:43.052 --> 01:08:44.487

AND THIS ONE YOU'LL BE IT IS A

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:11.333
LIMITING WHEN THE STUDENTS SO --

01:11:35.557 --> 01:11:37.559
NO WHY.

AT THAT WOULD BE MY FIRST

01:11:38.627 --> 01:11:40.462
QUESTION AND THEN I HAVE SOME

01:11:40.529 --> 01:11:42.131
SIMPLE QUESTIONS.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.433
WELL AS WE KNOW I DIFFERENT

01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:46.368
PARTS OF OUR STATES ARE DOING

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:47.970
BETTER THAN OTHERS AND IT'S A

01:11:48.037 --> 01:11:49.304
REGIONAL ISSUE AS WELL SO

01:11:49.371 --> 01:11:50.773
DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU'RE GOING

01:11:50.839 --> 01:11:51.707
TO COLLEGE.

01:11:51.774 --> 01:11:53.575
HOW WERE YOU GRADUATES AND A LOT

01:11:53.642 --> 01:11:55.577
OF STUDENTS HAVE TO LOOK FOR FOR

01:11:55.644 --> 01:11:56.545
WORK?

01:11:56.612 --> 01:11:59.715
OUTSIDE OF THEIR AREA THAT THEY

01:11:59.782 --> 01:12:01.817
GRADUATED AND AND THIS IS AN

01:12:01.884 --> 01:12:03.786
ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN SEEING

01:12:03.852 --> 01:12:06.655
YEAR AFTER YEAR WITH GRADUATES --

01:12:06.722 --> 01:12:08.957
BUT THE OVERALL ISSUE IS

01:12:09.024 --> 01:12:09.692
CONCERNING.

01:12:09.758 --> 01:12:12.161
ARE GROWING CRISIS IN STUDENT

01:12:12.227 --> 01:12:13.262
LOAN DEBT.

01:12:13.328 --> 01:12:15.330
STUDENT LOANS ARE THE SECOND

01:12:15.397 --> 01:12:17.499
LARGEST CONSUMER DEBT SEGMENT

01:12:17.566 --> 01:12:20.536
AND HAVE SURPASSED HOME EQUITY.

01:12:20.602 --> 01:12:22.604
A REVOLVING DEBT AUTO LOANS AND

01:12:22.671 --> 01:12:24.606
CREDIT CARD DEBT BALANCES

01:12:24.673 --> 01:12:26.008
SHORTLY AFTER THE RECESSION.

01:12:26.075 --> 01:12:27.609
AND SO THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT I

01:12:27.676 --> 01:12:29.545
BELIEVE WE AS A LEGISLATURE MUST

01:12:29.611 --> 01:12:31.580
LEAN AND ON AND ADDRESS.

01:12:31.647 --> 01:12:34.116
AND WE MUST TO DO THIS BY PASSED

01:12:34.183 --> 01:12:36.385
SEED POLICIES I THAT ADDRESSES

01:12:36.452 --> 01:12:37.486
VERY ISSUE.

01:12:37.553 --> 01:12:40.522
I WILL THOUGH TURN IT OVER --

01:12:40.589 --> 01:12:43.892
TESTIFYING IN SUPPORT TODAY

01:12:43.959 --> 01:12:46.462
SHOULD THEY WANT TO ADD ON I

01:12:46.528 --> 01:12:48.097
MEAN I I WOULD REITERATE THE

01:12:48.163 --> 01:12:49.064
ASSEMBLY MEMBERS COMMENTS I'D

01:12:49.131 --> 01:12:50.799
SAY THAT SEEING THE THE THE

01:12:50.866 --> 01:12:52.434
GROWTH IN STUDENT LOAN DEBT OVER

01:12:52.501 --> 01:12:53.836
THE COURSE OF THE LAST TEN YEARS

01:12:53.902 --> 01:12:54.970
AND SING AT TRIPLE I THINK

01:12:55.037 --> 01:12:55.938
UNDERSCORES.

01:12:56.004 --> 01:12:57.706
HOW BIG OF A CRISIS THIS IS

01:12:57.773 --> 01:12:59.074
AGAIN IN THE CSU IT AS YOU WOULD

01:12:59.141 --> 01:13:01.176
ASSUME WITH A LOW TUITION RATE

01:13:01.243 --> 01:13:02.277
AND THE FACT THAT MANY OF OUR

01:13:02.344 --> 01:13:03.712
STUDENTS DON'T PAY TUITION THAT

01:13:03.779 --> 01:13:05.180
IT WOULDN'T BE AN ISSUE BUT?

01:13:05.247 --> 01:13:06.482
AFFORDING THE TOTAL COST OF

01:13:06.548 --> 01:13:07.583
ATTENDANCE AND BEING ABLE TO

01:13:07.649 --> 01:13:08.450
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA WHILE

01:13:08.517 --> 01:13:10.586
PURSUING A DEGREE HAS BEEN A

01:13:10.652 --> 01:13:12.554
UNIQUE CHALLENGE TODAY IN A WAY

01:13:12.621 --> 01:13:13.922
THAT IT MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN

01:13:13.989 --> 01:13:15.023
TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS AGO JUST

01:13:15.090 --> 01:13:17.292
SEEING THAT GROWTH AND STUDENT

01:13:17.359 --> 01:13:19.661
LOAN DEBT.

01:13:19.728 --> 01:13:25.000
YOU KNOW MY QUESTION WAS --

01:13:25.067 --> 01:13:27.302
STILL RUNS OUT NOT.

01:13:27.369 --> 01:13:29.338
ABOUT THE FACT THAT THIS IS TO

01:13:29.404 --> 01:13:31.774
RINSE OUT GRADUATING WITH IT --

01:13:31.840 --> 01:13:34.076
WITH THE TUITION DEBTS.

01:13:34.143 --> 01:13:36.044
YUP COLLEGES ARE EXPENSIVE.

01:13:36.111 --> 01:13:38.714
AND MY A MY TWO MAJOR QUESTIONS

01:13:38.781 --> 01:13:43.285
WORLD WHY CERTAIN SECTORS OF THE

01:13:43.352 --> 01:13:44.887
POPULATION [inaudible]

01:13:44.953 --> 01:13:51.627
ON A ARE STRUGGLING IN A PAYING.

01:13:51.693 --> 01:13:52.861
AND WITH THE SAME EQUAL OR

01:13:52.928 --> 01:13:54.897
DEGREE SO WHEN THEY GRADUATE WE

01:13:54.963 --> 01:13:56.832
ADOPT OUR LOAN FORGIVENESS A

01:13:56.899 --> 01:13:57.599
PROGRAM.

01:13:57.666 --> 01:14:00.769
NOT A SCHOLARSHIP NUMBER --

01:14:00.836 --> 01:14:02.538
TWO WAS THAT THE ALREADY.

01:14:02.604 --> 01:14:05.174
INCOME DRIVEN NOT A REPAYMENT

01:14:05.240 --> 01:14:07.309
PLAN --

01:14:07.376 --> 01:14:10.913
ALLOWS -- TO

01:14:10.979 --> 01:14:16.251
BEFORE THE INDIVIDUALS HEY.

01:14:16.318 --> 01:14:17.820
THIS SO YOU'RE AFTER YEAR.

01:14:17.886 --> 01:14:18.687
HALL.

01:14:18.754 --> 01:14:23.292
ALLOWING THEIR LIVING EXPENSES.

01:14:23.358 --> 01:14:25.194
A AND THEN ONE OF THE

01:14:25.260 --> 01:14:31.800
COMFORTABLE AMOUNT OF AND SO --

01:14:31.867 --> 01:14:33.268
NOW STATE THAT COMES IN.

01:14:33.335 --> 01:14:35.771
AS MUCH AS OF FORTY TWO MILLION

01:14:35.838 --> 01:14:38.273
DOLLARS ANNUALLY.

01:14:38.340 --> 01:14:41.877
WE WE WE TRY TO PROVIDE AS MUCH

01:14:41.944 --> 01:14:45.113
SCHOLARSHIP ORDER THE LOAN.

01:14:45.180 --> 01:14:45.681
AND THEN I'VE I THINK THIS

01:14:45.747 --> 01:14:46.448
SHOULD BE.

01:14:46.515 --> 01:14:49.518
OF MORE ENCOURAGING FOR THEM TO

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:53.455
GET A JOB AND ENCOURAGING --

01:14:53.522 --> 01:14:58.560
BUT THE EMPLOYERS TO PAY --

01:14:58.627 --> 01:14:59.862
RESPECTABLE.

01:14:59.928 --> 01:15:01.129
A SALARY WITH A BACHELOR'S

01:15:01.196 --> 01:15:02.531
DEGREE.

01:15:02.598 --> 01:15:03.966
WHEN WE ARE TALKING ABOUT THE A

01:15:04.032 --> 01:15:06.168
MAJORITY WOULD BE --

01:15:06.235 --> 01:15:08.537
UNDERGRADUATE THE CHILDREN.

01:15:08.604 --> 01:15:10.672
OF GRADUATES TO WE ARE SPEAKING

01:15:10.739 --> 01:15:14.643
ABOUT THE AND THE MOST CASES OUT

01:15:14.710 --> 01:15:16.578
OF THE B. K. R..

01:15:16.645 --> 01:15:18.447
O. DIDN'T DISSIPATE THE THEIR

01:15:18.513 --> 01:15:22.117
BASIC SALARY PROBABLY MINIMUM

01:15:22.184 --> 01:15:40.535
THRESHOLD DOSE.

01:15:48.277 --> 01:15:48.443
. FOR FIFTY

01:15:48.510 --> 01:15:49.611
THOUSAND DOLLARS BELOW.

01:15:49.678 --> 01:15:51.046
HERE.

01:15:51.113 --> 01:15:51.680
BUT THE WHY IS CERTAIN.

01:15:51.747 --> 01:15:52.648
GROUP BOB POPULATION THAT YOU

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:53.582
MENTIONED.

01:15:53.649 --> 01:15:54.416
THEY THEY THEY ARE.

01:15:54.483 --> 01:15:56.385
UP.

01:15:56.451 --> 01:16:05.861
MORE SUFFERING FROM THIS --

01:16:05.928 --> 01:16:08.096
THEY NEED A LEG UP.

01:16:08.163 --> 01:16:09.364
I'LL EXPLAIN MY SITUATION FOR

01:16:09.431 --> 01:16:10.465
EXAMPLE --

01:16:10.532 --> 01:16:12.768
YOU KNOW WHEN I WAS GROWING UP --

01:16:12.834 --> 01:16:14.136
MY PARENTS HAVE COME HERE TO

01:16:14.202 --> 01:16:15.704
THIS COUNTRY THEN HOW MUCH --

01:16:15.771 --> 01:16:16.571
MONEY -- DO

01:16:16.638 --> 01:16:18.407
KNOW THE EDUCATION --

01:16:18.473 --> 01:16:19.841
BUT I'M IS GET THROUGH SCHOOL

01:16:19.908 --> 01:16:21.143
SYSTEM -- I

01:16:21.209 --> 01:16:23.879
WENT TO UCLA --

01:16:23.946 --> 01:16:24.913
WE HAD I HAD TO TAKE A LOAN.

01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:25.948
PLAIN AND SIMPLE BUT I ALSO HAD

01:16:26.014 --> 01:16:27.215
TO HELP --

01:16:27.282 --> 01:16:28.383
WITH FAMILY INCOME BECAUSE IT

01:16:28.450 --> 01:16:30.018
WASN'T ENOUGH --

01:16:30.085 --> 01:16:31.820
OFF MY PARENTS A MINIMUM WAGE --

01:16:31.887 --> 01:16:33.188

DID MY BROTHER --

01:16:34.890 --> 01:16:36.558
BUT I THINK THE THE THESE THE

01:16:36.625 --> 01:16:39.695
SIMPLE ANSWER IS --

01:16:39.761 --> 01:16:42.798
THEY JUST DON'T HAVE THE MONEY.

01:16:42.864 --> 01:16:43.765
IT'S IT'S A MUCH MORE

01:16:43.832 --> 01:16:44.633
COMPLICATED THAN THAT.

01:16:44.700 --> 01:16:48.370
AND I DON'T SEE A PROBLEM WITH

01:16:48.437 --> 01:16:49.571
PASSED A BILL THAT HELPS US

01:16:49.638 --> 01:16:50.872
WITHIN TWENTY COMES THE DEBT

01:16:50.939 --> 01:16:52.641
BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE OF THE

01:16:52.708 --> 01:16:54.509
MOST IMPORTANT ISSUES.

01:16:54.576 --> 01:16:56.578
FACING THIS COUNTRY --

01:16:56.645 --> 01:16:58.080
BUT I DO WANT TO STICK TO THE

01:16:58.146 --> 01:16:59.014
QUESTION THAT YOU'RE ASKING I.

01:16:59.081 --> 01:17:00.382
I'LL AND ANSWER FROM MY OWN

01:17:00.449 --> 01:17:02.684
PERSONAL EXPERIENCE --

01:17:02.751 --> 01:17:05.687
HOUSE POOR PEOPLE CHOOSE THE

01:17:05.754 --> 01:17:07.823

AND I WHEN I WAS GOING TO UCLA

01:17:17.299 --> 01:17:18.900
MOST OF THE TIME --

01:17:18.967 --> 01:17:20.202
BUT IT WASN'T ENOUGH TO MAKE

01:17:20.268 --> 01:17:21.636
BILLS -- IT

01:17:21.703 --> 01:17:23.071

01:17:23.138 --> 01:17:24.473
I HAD TO TAKE LOANS AND YES I

01:17:24.539 --> 01:17:26.141
DID TAKE FINANCIAL AID --

01:17:26.208 --> 01:17:26.975
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER THE NUMBERS

01:17:27.042 --> 01:17:28.543
OFF THE TOP OF MY HEAD THE CHAIR

01:17:28.610 --> 01:17:29.511
CAN CORRECT ME.

01:17:29.578 --> 01:17:30.379
BUT IT'S GOT TO BE ABOUT WHAT IS

01:17:30.445 --> 01:17:33.015
IT THIRTY TWO THIRTY FOUR

01:17:33.081 --> 01:17:34.383

IT ADDS UP AND SO --

01:17:51.666 --> 01:17:52.234
THERE'S A REASON WHY PEOPLE GET

01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:53.101
