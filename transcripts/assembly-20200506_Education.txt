AND THAT YOU'VE ALL DONE IT SO THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE TO MAKE THIS POSSIBLE. I PRESENT TO YOU TODAY EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE WHICH IS THE LC UP OF CONCENTRATION. GRANT REPORTING. OF YOU KNOW THE I GUESS WE'RE HERE SO IN A TWENTY THIRTEEN EXCEPT THE STAFF. WHEN WE DECIDED TO DO IN A DIFFERENT THE DIFFERENT TYPE OF. FUNDING FOR SCHOOLS LET SOME OF SUB ELIMINATING A NUMBER OF A CAB A- AND DEVELOPING A PROCESS WHERE WE WOULD BASICALLY FUNDING SCHOOLS WITH THE BASE GRANT. AND THEN DEVELOPING TO OTHER A GRANT WHICH IS A CONSTANT IN THE SUPPLEMENT GRANT. THIS WAS DESIGN SPECIFICALLY. OF ADDRESSING THE ISSUE OF THE GAP MAKING SURE THAT WE WERE. A FIVE. FOR ENGLISH GOING LEARNERS INCOME FOSTER CARE AND THOUGHT CARE. AND THE IS THE WITH THE WITH THE- AND THE UNDER OF ALL THE WERE INVOLVED IN A GREAT. THAT IT TOOK A LITTLE BIT TO IT KIDS TO WORK WHO OF. A DEAL WITH ISSUE WITH WITH CARE ALMOST THOSE KIND OF THE FACT. AND SO THIS THE TIME TO BASIC CLOSE THE CHEAP GAP. AT THE TWO WE AGREE THAT THERE WOULD BE ACCOUNT. SURE THAT THE WAS GOING TO THE CHILDREN WAS AND TEN FOR. AND THIS WAS A AN EFFORT THAT WAS THE REALLY IN A VERY BY. MANNER AND I APPRECIATE THE RIVER WERE ON WITH OFFICE TO THIS KIND. AND WE ALL WORK AS A TWO TO MAKE SURE THAT KNOWING THAT. THERE WOULD BE SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN WHAT I FROM. OR A LOT AREA THAT WOULD NOT GET OF THE KIND. OF SUPPLEMENT GRANTS THE THOSE. EXPELLED VERY STRONG THAT CLOSELY KEEP GAP WAS EXTRA AND CAL. AND THAT THIS WOULD BE A THAT WE WOULD INVESTED THOSE. LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FOR ME BECAUSE I FELT AFTER FIVE OR SIX YEARS THAT WE SHOULD BASICALLY KNOW. WHAT WE'VE DONE WITH THE MONEY AND WHAT THE NOT THE MONEY IS GOING TO THE KIDS THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR. UNFORTUNATELY AND SOUGHT AFTER LOOK AT THREE PFISTER'S CALL WAS OPEN AND SAN DIEGO UNFORTUNATELY THE AUDITOR A ROOF CAME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT WE PROBABLY MOST FEARED. THAT MOST OF THE MONEY WAS NOT GOING INTO THE AREAS AT THAT TIME THAT IT NEEDED TO GO. AND AS A RESULT THEY HAVE BEEN VERY LITTLE OVERSIGHT TO ENSURE THAT THE MONEY WAS GOING INTO THE PARTICULAR DISTRICTS AND FOR THE PARTICULAR CHILDREN TO CLOSE THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP. IN ADDITION TO THAT THEY ALSO FOUND THAT MANY OF THE ON SPENT DOLLARS THAT WE USE WERE BASICALLY ROLLED OVER FROM YEAR TO YEAR AND WOULD PUT INTO THE BASIC GRANT AND PUT INTO THE BASIC FUNDS OF THE DISTRICT. SO THAT INSTEAD OF KEEPING MOST OF MY DOLLARS FOR THE KIDS THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR IT WAS IN TURN IT TO THE REGULAR BUDGET OF THE DISTRICT AND THEREFORE USED FOR THAT. IT DISCOVERED THAT THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY. FOUR POINT SIX MILLION DOLLARS BASICALLY. IT DOING THIS FOR TWO YEARS SINCE TWENTY FOURTEEN THAT SAN DIEGO CALL WITHIN OAKLAND HAD ROLLED OVER THREE AND TWENTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS INTO THEIR REGULAR A BASE GRANT. RATHER THAN USING IT FOR THE CHILDREN THAT WERE INTENDED TO DO.THE RECOMMENDATION FOR THE ABOUT FROM THE AUDITOR WAS THAT WE DO A COUPLE OF THINGS ONE THAT WE DEVELOP A SYSTEM OF ACCOUNTABILITY FOR THE MONEY THAT WAS IN IT ANOTHER BILL I. THIRTY BUT IT ALL SAID THAT IN EIGHTEEN FIVE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THE MONEY THAT WAS FOR THE WITH. FOR THE KIND. GRANTS FOR THE OFFICE OF GRANT. BOTH THOSE WOULD BE. IT COULDN'T. ONE YOU. BE ROLLED OVER AND USED. NEW YEAR FOR THE SAME. IT WILL DESIGNED. THIS ISN'T. TO PREVENT. A WHAT WE SAW A KIND OF A PERVERSE. AT IF WILL DON'T YOU THAT WE CAN ALL. USE IT FOR US. AND THAT WILL BE NO INCENTIVE THEN TO USE IT FOR THE KID. AS IT WAS. FOR YEAR. SO THIS BILL WAS. OF THAT YOU THINK MUCH TODAY AND I DON'T. BIT OF. THE DATA OF THE TREATMENT GAP IN TERM OF. THE GAP IS THE EXPERTS. IS GOT SOME. GOAL DIFFERENT. IN EVERYBODY. LANGUAGE ARE AS WELL IN MAC. OF THERE'S A NEW FOR GREATER KIND OF. FOR MAKING SURE THESE THAT WE HEALTHY TO. GAP IN TELL. THIS WAS OUR COMMITMENT DO IT. SO THIS. THEN THE- REPORT AND SAY BASIC. THAT YOU. BOTH DOLLARS AND NOT YOU THANK YOU FOR THE CHILDREN ARE INTENT. IF IT IS ROLLED ALL. INTO THE- TO THE MONEY. BE USED FOR THOSE WITH. TO ARE TO. TODAY WE WITH US JESSE WELL FORMER WHO WOULD TEACH PLUS. AND SAM TRY. FROM NOW. TODAY IN ORDER TO SHINE A LIGHT ON AND AGREE JUST LOOPHOLE. A LOOPHOLE THAT SIPHONING OFF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. FROM VULNERABLE STUDENTS EACH YEAR. IN NOVEMBER AS ASSEMBLY MEMBER WEBER NOTED. THE STATE AUDITOR FOUND THAT SOME SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE USING UNSPENT SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DOLLARS INTENDED. TO HELP EDUCATE ENGLISH LEARNERS. FOSTER YOUTH AND LOW INCOME STUDENTS FOR GENERAL PURPOSES. TODAY YOU'RE LIKELY TO HEAR FROM MANY OF OUR FRIENDS AND COLLEAGUES. IN THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY. CALLING ON THE COMMITTEE TO VOTE NO ON AB EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE. IN A SEVERE TO FLEXIBILITY. TO TACKLE THE MOUNTING BUDGET CRISIS. FLEXING SUPPLEMENTAL CONCENTRATION DOLLARS IS NOT THE ANSWER. THIS FUNDING IS ALREADY FLEXIBLE IN FACT IT CAN BE USED IN ANY NUMBER OF WAYS BASED ON LOCAL DISCRETION. ALL THAT IS REQUIRED IS THAT IT'S USED TO BENEFIT. CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE STUDENTS. THESE ARE THE VERY CHILDREN WHO ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT IMPACTED BY THE GLOBAL PANDEMIC. STUDENTS WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO MAKE ENDS MEET. WHO ARE FLUENT IN ENGLISH. OVER FACED ABUSE AND TRAUMA. THE CONSEQUENCES OF THE PROFOUND LEARNING LOSS THAT IS OCCURRING RIGHT NOW. FOR THE STATE'S MAY REP RIPPLE THROUGH THIS GENERATION. EXACERBATING ALREADY INTOLERABLE GAPS IN A CHEAP. WE ARE DEEPLY SENSITIVE TO THE FACT THAT SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE IMPACT OF THE ECONOMIC SITUATION THE STATE NOW FACES. WE ARE TOO. THIS IS WHY WE ORGANIZE THE COALITION LETTER OF SEVEN HUNDRED SIXTY GROUPS. CALLING ON THE LEGISLATURE AND GOVERNOR TO PRIORITIZE KIDS AND NOT CUT FUNDING TO SCHOOLS. WE STAND WITH THE EDUCATION COMMUNITY WHEN IT COMES TO PROTECTING EDUCATION FUNDING. BUT WE MUST ALSO STAND AFFORDABLE KIDS AND PROTECT THEM IN THIS TIME OF CRISIS. IS FOR THESE REASONS WE STRONGLY ENCOURAGE YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. EIGHTEEN THIRTY FIVE. THANK YOU- WILL GO TO OUR NEXT WITNESS ON THE PHONE WHICH IS- JESSE WELCOME HER.

SO I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO. I'D LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR AND A STAFF OF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AB NINETY TWO WOULD ALLOW TEACHER CREDENTIAL CANDIDATES TO USE QUALIFYING COURSEWORK TO SATISFY THE STATE'S MANDATED BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENTS OR BSR. THE BIZARRE ENSURES THAT CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ARE PROFICIENT IN READING WRITING AND MATHEMATICS BEFORE ENTERING A CREDENTIAL PROGRAM. HOWEVER WITH THE CANCELLATION AND DELAY OF THE SEA BEST TEST DO TO COPE IN NINETEEN. MANY CREDENTIAL CANCER LEFT WITHOUT A WAY TO SATISFY THE BSR CURRENTLY. CONSEQUENTLY THEY WILL NOT BE ABLE TO ENTER THE TEACHING CREDENTIAL PROGRAM WHICH MIGHT EXACERBATE THE TEACHER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. THIS BILL WOULD ADDRESS THE TEST CANCELLATION. BY ALLOWING CANDIDATES FOR THE NEXT THREE YEARS TO USE QUALIFYING COLLEGE COURSEWORK TO SATISFY THE BSR AND ENTERED THE CREDENTIAL PROGRAMS THEY MUST EARN AB OR BETTER IN THE QUALIFYING COURSEWORK. WE ARE. IN THE MIDST OF AN UNPRECEDENTED TEACHER SHORTAGE IN CALIFORNIA. IT'S BEING MADE WORSE BY THE CANCELLATION TESTED COVERT WE NEED SOME FLEXIBILITY THIS IS OF PARTICULAR CONCERN IN THE AREA OF ELEMENTARY SCHOOL EDUCATION WHERE THE SEA BEST HAS. SHOWN TO BE SOMEWHAT OF AN IMPEDIMENT. TO RECRUITING QUALIFIED QUALITY TEACHERS. CBS WAS ENACTED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY BUT CALIFORNIA HAS NEVER STUDIED IT'S EFFICACY THERE IS NO STUDY SHOWING IT CORRELATES WITH CLASSROOM TEACHER PERFORMANCE. THERE'S NO EVIDENCE THAT PASSED IN THE C. BEST LEADS TO BETTER TEACHING PERFORMANCE. IN FACT THERE'S A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY THAT'S THE BEST ACTUALLY HAS NO CORRELATION TO FUTURE PERFORMANCE. I AM NOT AN ANTI STANDARDIZED TESTS GUY SO IT'S SOMEWHAT IRONIC THAT I'M HERE. IN A BRIEF Y. PRESENT THE SPELL. CAN I PULL DOWN. SO OUT. THIS IS GREAT THANK YOU YEAH BUT I WANT TO PASS OUT. I'VE NEVER WORN WITH THESE MASS IT IS HARD AS HECK TO BREATHE TALKING THE STATE LIFE LIKE THAT THANK YOU. SO YOU KNOW FOR INSTANCE THE ELSE AT THE LAW SCHOOL ADMISSION TEST THAT THINK IT'S ACTUALLY. QUITE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SKILLS YOU NEED TO- QUOTE THINK LIKE A LAWYER I THINK THE M. CAT IS A PRETTY GOOD REPRESENTATION SKILLS. AND KNOWLEDGE BASE THAT YOU NEED TO BE A DOCTOR. I THE QUESTION I THINK. ALL THAT FOR THE SEA BASS IS WHETHER IT CORRELATES. TO TEACHING PERFORMANCE THAT I DON'T THINK THERE'S ANY EVIDENCE THAT IT DOES. THIS WOULD ENHANCE FLEXIBILITY AND- IT'S IMPORTANT TO KEEP IN MIND THAT THE C. BEST. IS CALIBRATED TO ATTEMPT TO TEST BASIC PROFICIENCIES IN READING WRITING MATHEMATICS ELEVENTH GRADE LEVEL BUT WORK THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW COLLEGE COURSEWORK WHICH BY DEFINITION IS HIGHER THAN ELEVENTH GRADE LEVEL TO COLLEGE LEVEL COURSEWORK. IF YOU'RE IN A BEER BETTER- TO MEET THE VSR. I THINK IT'S A WORTHY. A BILL APPRECIATE THE CONSIDERATION. AND THUS ENDS MY PRESENTATION. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM. SEE THE WITNESSES ON THE PHONE- I GUESS WE DON'T HAVE ANY SEE ANY SUPPORT ON THE PHONE I APOLOGIZE. YEAH I'M SORRY WE DO. IT'S HARD WHERE ISABEL- GARCIA FROM THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION A DOWN THE VIDEO THE VIDEO ROOM I APOLOGIZE I WAS ON THE RUN BILL. FIFTY GOOD MORNING MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I AM IF THIS BILL GARCIA REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION URGING YOUR SUPPORT FOR THE CTA COSPONSORED NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO THIS IMPORTANT BILL MAINTAINS THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BASIC SKILLS MEASUREMENT IN READING WRITING AND MATHEMATICS FOR TEACHER CANDIDATES BUT ALLOWS PERSPECTIVE TEACHERS TO MIX AND MATCH QUALIFYING COURSEWORK WITH OTHER EXISTING OPTIONS TO MEET THE BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENT. CTA BELIEVES THERE'S A BELL WILL INCENTIVIZE DIVERS TALENTED INDIVIDUALS TO ENTER THE TEACHING PROFESSION WITH THESE ADDITIONAL NINE TEST BASED OPTIONS TO MEET THE BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENTS WHILE MAINTAINING HIGH STANDARDS FOR THE FASHION. SEE BELIEVES TEACHER CANDIDATE SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO DEMONSTRATE PROFICIENCY IN BASIC SKILLS IN MULTIPLE WAYS INCLUDING QUALIFYING COURSEWORK. THE BILL GOES FURTHER TO ENSURE HIGH STANDARDS BY REQUIRING A BI OR BETTER IN COURTS WORK TO DEMONSTRATE BASIC SKILLS BEYOND THE EXISTING REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE ALLOWING FOR A C. OR BETTER IN COURTS WORK TO DEMONSTRATE SUBJECT MATTER COMPETENCY. CALIFORNIA'SCHRONIC TEACHER SHORTAGES COMPOUNDED WITH THE COVERT NINETEEN TESTING CENTER CLOSURES THE IMPACT ON THE TEACHER PIPELINE IS SEVERE IN THIS BILL IS NEEDED TO BROADEN THE ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS FOR INTERESTED INDIVIDUALS TO ENTER THE TEACHING PROFESSION TO MEET THE BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT INCURRING MORE COST FOR MORE DELAYS.

THANK YOU ALL- WITH THAT WILL GO TO THE OPPOSITION AND I BELIEVE OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE IS- BREAD INTO THE EGG FROM- IT. INVOICES ON THE PHONE IF I'M CORRECT. AND WE WENT IN. THERE WE GOT I MEAN I'M IN. UP ON BEHALF OF AT VOICE WERE OPPOSED TO AB NINETEEN EIGHTY TWO WHICH WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THE BAR FOR TEACHER CANDIDATES TO BE DEMONSTRATED MINIMUM PROFICIENCY IN BASIC READING WRITING AND MATHEMATICS SKILLS OBJECTIVE DEMONSTRATION OF MINIMUM PROFICIENCY IN BASIC SKILLS PROVIDES A MINIMUM GUARANTEED TO PARENTS. THAT TEACHERS ARE COMPETENT AND BASIC SKILLS BY ALLOWING TEACHER CANDIDATES TO SUBSTITUTE COURSEWORK FOR THE FEEDBACK REQUIREMENTS THIS BILL SAYS THAT ALL COLLEGE BE GRADES AT OVER SEVEN THOUSAND INSTITUTIONS ACROSS THE NATION ARE EQUIVALENT WHICH WE KNOW IS NOT THE CASE CALIFORNIA ALREADY ALLOWS EXEMPTIONS FROM THE SEA BASS FOR EXAMPLE. CANDIDATES CAN SATISFY SATISFY THE BASIC SKILLS REQUIREMENT BY ATTAINING SPECIFIED SCHOOLS ON THE SAT ACT. AN A. P. EXAMS AMONG OTHERS THE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THOSE ARE ALL OBJECTIVISTS JASMINE'S RATHER THAN GRADES THAT VARY FROM ONE COLLEGE TO THE NEXT THE CBS NOT PLACE AN UNREASONABLE BURDEN ON TEACHER CANDIDATES IN MATH OFTEN CITED AS A DIFFICULT SUBJECT. THE HIGHEST COMMON CORE STANDARD OF STAFF TO THE SEVENTH GRADE LEVEL CONTENT REGULAR OF PRE ALGEBRA HELLO MATH ONE. NINETEEN IT'S EVEN MORE IMPORTANT TO MAINTAIN ITS MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS BECAUSE SCHOOLS WILL LIKELY HAVE TO IMPLEMENT SOCIAL DISTANCING IN OTHER CHANGES TOO MANY MORE TEACHERS TO ADDRESS THE NEED. SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE A TEACHER SHORTAGE IT'S LIKE WE WILL HAVE MORE LONG TERM STEPS TO WITH THE MANAGED. FORTUNATELY IMPACTED THE BATCHES MEANINGFUL FILTER SUBS. ACCORDING TO SEE DATA THE FIRST TIME PASSAGE RATE FOR. AN AMERICAN PERMIT IN IN THE SAN AND THE KING THAT RATED FROM THE EIGHTY. WHILE THE PASSAGE FOR CAN GOING THROUGH TEACHER PREP PROGRAM IS BETWEEN NINETY FIVE AND A HUNDRED. WITHOUT MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS IN PLACE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WILL BE AT EVEN GREATER RISK OF BEING TAUGHT BY SOMEONE THAT ISN'T COMPETENT AND BASIC SKILLS. LAST I'LL POINT OUT THAT BEEN FOR THE CPC PROVIDED A DEFERRAL OF UP TO ONE YEAR FOR THE C. BEST TO COVER NINETEEN. AND TESTING OPPORTUNITIES ARE AVAILABLE IN VARIOUS LOCATIONS WITH MORE COMING UP MEMBERS THIS IS ADEQUATE OPPORTUNITY WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

I'LL NEVER GET BACK ANY OPPOSITION IN THE ROOM SEEN OPPOSITION THE ROOM WILL GO TO THE COMMITTEE TO EMOTION FIRST. SOME OF IT'S MY MOVED AND ALL SECOND. BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SO QUESTION TERM FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS MR MCCARTY. THANK YOU MISTER CUNNINGHAM I SUPPORT THE BILL I MADE THE MOTION THE AND AS YOU OUTLINED THE BILL YOU TALKED ABOUT HOW NOW IT'S RELATED TO CULTIVATE NINETEEN OF THIS THREE YEAR PEACE BUT WE WHEN YOU INTRODUCED IT IT WAS MUCH MORE- MUCH MORE BROAD CORRECT SO IT'S NARROWED AND YOU'VE YOU'VE TAILORED IT TO THE SPINE AT NUMBER OF YEARS. SO DO YOU THINK THAT ADDRESSES SOME OF THAT. OUT OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND CONCERNS. YEAH THAT WAS. THAT WAS THE COMMITTEES IDEA I THINK IT WAS A GOOD ONE WHEN I INTRODUCED THE BILL WAS- IT DID NOT HAVE A THREE YEAR SUNSET AND NOW WE'VE ADDED THE THREE OR SUNSET AND I THINK- THAT'S VALUABLE BECAUSE WE CAN SORT OF STUDY AND ASSESS HOW IT'S WORKING COUPLE YEARS OUT. AND LOOK AT WHETHER IT SHOULD BE EXTENDED AFTER THAT AND I THINK- TO YOUR POINT ABOUT THE CO THAT RELATIONSHIP THAT YOU KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT A PROBLEM ALL THESE PEOPLE ARE ABLE TO TAKE THIS TEST THIS YEAR AND THEREFORE THEY'RE NOT ABLE TO GET INTO THEIR CREDENTIALING PRO AND WE ALREADY HAVE A LOOMING SHORTAGE IN THE FACT. THAT THE SO I MEAN. WE HAVE TO SOMETHING OUT OF. THE PEOPLE THE- DON'T HAVE THE OP. TO TAKE THIS TEST AND GET GET INTO TEACHING- AND THEN I WANTED TO DRESS IF. THERE IF IT'S OKAY OF THE CHAIR MAYBE SOME OF THE- ARGUMENTS. MADE BY THE OPPOSITION. BUT YEAH I WELL I WANT YOU THAT IN YOUR CLOSEST TO MAKE SURE THERE AREN'T ANY OTHER COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I. MR KILEY. I'M NOT QUITE ALIGNED WITH- WHAT TIMES TO CUNNINGHAM IS TRYING TO DO HERE BACK I'D LOVE NOTHING MORE THAN TO SEE OCCUPATIONAL LICENSING REFORM ACROSS THE WHOLE RANGE OF PROFESSIONS IN CALIFORNIA WE HAVE A THE MOST ONEROUS- BURDENS- TO ADD TO WORK IN CALIFORNIA OF ANY STATE ARE ROUTINELY RATED THAT WAY THAT THE REASON I'M GONNA UP STAYING FOR TODAY- IS I THINK THERE ARE SOME DISTINCT CONSIDERATIONS WHEN IT COMES TO ADD. AS OF THE EXISTENCE OF A OF TENURE LAWS WHICH ARE ACTUALLY- AND NATIONAL OUT WIRE HERE IN CALIFORNIA- FOR THE WAY THEY ARE STRUCTURED- WHICH MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO DO MEANINGFUL EVALUATION AND PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT FOR FOLKS- ONCE THEY'RE IN THE PROFESSION SO- I'M I YEAH I THINK THAT YOU KNOW MISTER CUNNINGHAM MAKES A COMPELLING CASE THAT THE SEA BASS IS NOT A WELL ALIGNED. TO EFFECTIVE TEACHING PRACTICE BUT I'D LIKE TO SEE AN EFFORT TO REFORM IT DONE IN CONJUNCTION WITH PUTTING IN A BETTER ASSESSMENT AS WELL AS WITH REFORMING OUR TENURE LAWS IN CREATING A SOMETHING THAT I AM STRIPPING IS VERY SUPPORTIVE OF WHICH IS ALTERNATIVE PATHWAYS FOR FOLKS WITH ASSET TECHNICAL BACKGROUND ENTERED TEACHING PROFESSION PRINCIPLE STUDENTS WITHOUT HAVING TO GO THROUGH AT THE CUSTOMARY ROUTE. THANK YOU THANK YOU NOTE CAL. K. TWELVE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS DON'T GET TENURE. THEY GET ON PROBATION OR STATUS. AWARE THAT ANY FURTHER COMMENTS FROM THE DOCTOR. YEAH I WANTED TO- AND I HAVE YOU KNOW SOME DIFFICULTY WITH THIS TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ONLY BECAUSE- YOU KNOW I THINK CLEARLY THE WHOLE ISSUE OF WHERE WE ARE NOW AND BEING ABLE HAVING TO SUSPEND TESTING IS REALLY HAD AN ISSUE IN A CONCERN. NOT SURE IF IT'S A THREE YEAR CONCERN BUT IT IS A CONCERN TEMPORARILY- AND IT'S NOT THAT DIFFICULT THE TASK BECAUSE YOU COULD JUST THE ACTUAL TESTING BIGGER ROOMS AND SPARE PEOPLE OUT AND SO. USING USING EVERYBODY SEEMS WILL USE COLD IT AS AN OPPORTUNITY TO DO SOMETHING THEY'VE ALWAYS WANTED TO DO- AND- AND SOMETIMES IT MATCHES AND SOMETIMES IT DOESN'T AND IN THIS IN THIS PARTICULAR CASE. I'M NOT SURE IF IT MATCHES BECAUSE THERE ARE WAYS IN WHICH YOU CAN TEST FOR CBS AND THEY HAVE LOTS AND LOTS OF TIPS IF YOU SPREAD PEOPLE OUT IT'S NOT LIKE THEY HAVE TO INTERACT WITH INDIVIDUALS. THEY CAN SPREAD THE MOP THE CANDIDATE VARIOUS KINDS OF WAYS. MY CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE IS I'M NOT SURE IT AS IS POINTED OUT THAT THIS IS THE THIS IS ANY TIME THE BEST WAY TO ACTUALLY SORT OF FIVE PEOPLE QUALIFIED TO TEACH IN OTHER WORDS WHAT THE TEST IS GOING TO DO IT. BOB THESE THE YOU KNOW THE STUDENTS WERE TAKING SEA BASS RIGHT NOW OUR STUDENTS WHO HAVE GONE THROUGH COLLEGE. THAT THEIR BACKS IS THE GREEK AND I ASKED TO PERFORM ELEVENTH GRADE LEVEL. IN THOSE WHO AND I'VE BEEN MUCH OF. ONCE AGAIN FOR THIS TO BE. CAN'T PAY. CBS WHICH ELEVEN. TEACH OF THE PROFICIENCY. AND I FIND IT DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE THAT THAT I WOULD WANT THEM TO GOING TO TEACH ENGLISH MAP TO MY KIDS. WHEN THEY CAN'T PASS AT ELEVEN GRADING THEY'VE SPENT THE LAST. TWELVE YEARS OF HIGH SCHOOL AT LEAST FOUR OF NOT MORE AND COLLEGE AND STILL HAVE HAVE ELEVEN GREAT PROFICIENCY. IN ENGLISH AND MATH. SO I HAD LOTS OF FRIENDS WHO TOLD YOU KNOW CBS AS RACIST AS THIS IS THAT SO FORTH AND SO ON I'VE HEARD. ALL OF THOSE STORIES. AND I HAVE TO REMIND MY STUDENTS THAT EVEN IF I BELIEVE CBS WAS RACES THEY GOT A EUROPEAN EDUCATION WHEN THEY WENT TO THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA. OR SEE ISSUE. SO IT'S NOT LIKE I SPENT THE WHOLE TIME- DISCUSSING BLACK LANGUAGE IN BLACK PEOPLE OR MEXICAN TO WHATEVER. THEY SPEND A VESTIGE. OF IT. THE ACADEMIC. STUDYING EUROPEAN CULTURE AND LANGUAGE MATH. SO YOU KNOW. IT'S A DIFFICULT THING FOR ME BECAUSE I DO THINK THERE ARE BETTER WAYS TO SURVIVE PEOPLE. I'M NOT SURE IF- IF THIS ISN'T. AN OPPORTUNITY JUST TO SUBSTITUTE WITH A CLASSROOM TESTS. AND HAVING SEEN STUDENTS. AS HAVING. SPENT FORTY YEARS OF UNIVERSITY. AND THINGS STUDENTS WHO ACTUALLY END UP IN MY CLASS OF SENIORS. AFTER HAVING THREE YEARS OF. SUPPOSEDLY SUCCESSFUL. ACADEMIC YOUR COLLEGE STILL ABLE. DO TO BE. WRITE AT A LEVEL FOR FIFTY I CAN. APPROPRIATE FOR SENIOR. IT DOESN'T ME A LOT OF HALF A DOZEN A THAT SOMETIMES STUDENTS TO A HATED THAT MY COLLEAGUE TO TEACH SO. I KNOW AND THEN I KNOW THIS IS A- SUPPOSED VICTIM FOR. BUT I WOULD HATE AS MOST THINGS DO WE PUT THINGS IN FOR THREE YEARS AND THEN WE- REMOVE THE SUNSET. AND IT BECOMES A THING AND WE NEVER DISCUSSED THE CRITICAL ISSUE OF HOW DO WE ENGAGE. IN CERTIFICATION OF TEACHERS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF YOUR CONCERNS TOO. HOW DO WE- DEVELOP A PROGRAM THAT'S BETTER AND I'VE SEEN SOME STATES ARE NOW GRAPPLING WITH IT AND DOING MORE IN TERMS OF. APPRENTICESHIPS AND SO FORTH AND SO ON AND- AND I'LL DIRECT EVALUATION OF NEW TEACHERS IN THE CLASSROOM AND DOING A WHOLE LOT OF WONDERFUL THINGS AND THEY- TALKED ABOUT IT HERE BUT THEY DO IN A LOT OF IT IN MICHIGAN. AND WE HAVE. CERTIFIED TO BE TEACHERS SUPPORT THEM WHILE THEY'RE THERE AND HAVE SOME SECURITY THAT WE CHOSE THE MOST FOLKS WERE READY FOR SCHOOL SO. I GET CONCERNED WHEN I SEE THE COLD WOULD BECOME THE ANSWER TO EVERYBODY'S PROBLEM. AND IT IS A PROBLEM AND IT IS A CHALLENGE OF BUT IT CAN'T BE THE ANSWER TO ALL THE THINGS THAT WE AFRAID TO ADDRESS. THAT'S MY CONCERN. THANK YOU- NO FIXING NO FURTHER COMMENT FROM THE- COMMITTEE. YOU MAY CLOSE. EFFICIENTLY PLEASE THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR OF DR WEBBER ALL AS TO THE COVERT ISSUE- MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT THE TESTS WERE CANCELLED RIGHT THAT FOR THIS YEAR IN THE SPRING AT THAT AS OF MAY FIRST CERTAIN TESTING SITES WILL BE RE OPENED BUT THERE'S SOME TROUBLE WITH THE ROLL OUT OF THAT AND SO THERE'S AND IT'S UNCLEAR WHETHER THE TEST IS ACTUALLY GONNA BE ADMINISTERED THIS YEAR REALLY ANYWHERE- SO. THAT'S THE IMPACT AND THEN- FROM COVERED NINETEEN THE THREE YEAR THING I MEAN THAT I GET THIS KIND OF SOME TIME TO GET THE CREDENTIALING COMMISSION TO. THE STUDY THAT'S FOR REAL. WHETHER THE YOU. SERVES A PURPOSE. AND WHETHER THAT PURPOSE AND WHETHER THERE'S VALUE IN IT THAT'S WORTH THE- YOU KNOW THE IMPEDIMENT. BECAUSE IT IS A PART OF SOME PEOPLE GETTING THE PROFESSIONAL COST MONEY TO TAKE IT. AND AGAIN THERE'S THEY PUT IT INTO LAW IN NINETEEN EIGHTY AND NOBODY'S EVER STUDY WHETHER IT WORKS. BY WORK I MEAN WHETHER THERE IS A- WHETHER IT IS A PREDICTOR OF TEACHING SUCCESS. AND WHERE THE REAL PINCH POINT JUST BE. COMPLETELY CANDID I THINK THE REAL PINCH POINT. ARE YOU HAVE FOLKS THAT HAVE TROUBLE WITH ELEVENTH GRADE MATH ON A STANDARDIZED-TESTS AND- THEY MAY BE FINE IF NOT THEY MAY. NOT BE OR BETTER. YET OR NAY ON THE COLLEGE LEVEL MATH COURSE WORK THE COUNTS. SO THEY THEY CAN DO IT IN THE CLASSROOM SETTING THEY THEY'VE SHOWN THAT NAY PROVEN THAT THEY CAN DO THAT. BUT THE GO TAKE A STANDARDIZED TEST AND SEE BEST. AND THEY AND THEY HAVE TROUBLE WITH THAT. AND THAT KEEPS THEM FROM GOING IN TEACHING LIKE FIRST GRADE OR SECOND GRADE OR THIRD GRADE WHERE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE TO TEACH. ELEVENTH GRADE MATH. THE BE TEACHING COUNTING AND STICKS AND BUNDLES AND- ALL THE THINGS THAT ARE YOU KNOW. MY YOUNGEST KIDS ARE LEARNING TO DO. YOU KNOW THAT OUR NEW- CURRICULUM THAT WE HAVE NOW MY DAUGHTER IS. DOING HOME SCHOOLING. AND THE TEACHERS MORE THAN WHAT WOULD NORMALLY HAPPEN TO ME I THANK GOD SHE'S A POSITION AND UNDERSTANDS IT. BUT IT REALLY GETS TO THE LOGIC OF MASS MUCH DEEPER UNDERSTAND THE MAP AND THAT'S A BIG CHALLENGE RIGHT NOW. IS THAT FOLKS CAN DO THE BASICS OF ONE TWO THREE AND ADD AND SUBTRACT. BUT WHEN YOU TALK TALKING ABOUT MATH AT A AT A DEEPER LEVEL IN TERMS OF THE LOGIC OF MATH. IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD AT MATH YOU ALMOST GO FILL THOSE KIDS IN IN IN THOSE GRADES AND SO SHE'S TEACHING HER KINDERGARTENERS AND HER. A SECOND GRADER MATH AND SHE SAID IT'S MUCH DEEPER THAN SHE HAD THOUGHT BEFORE TONIGHT HE WAS A MATH AND SCIENCE MAJOR. US SO ACTIVEBUT WHAT I DON'T YOU KNOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THE TEST HAS NOT BEEN DONE DOES THIS BILL REQUIRED THEM TO. THE COULD I'VE- INTENTION WOULD BE TO WORK WITH THE CREDENTIALING COMMISSION. THE MENTOR NO NO. NO MANDATE THATTHEY DO IT OKAY WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THEM. THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS AND THE MAN IN THE BILL. THAT'S SOMETHING WE COULD ADD. TO IT I'D LIKE TO. SEE THAT BUT I THINK IF TO HAVE ME RIGHT WHERE I THOUGHT THAT WOULD. MAKE IT HARDER. BUT IT'S PROBABLY WOULD YEAH RIGHT. TRYING TO. DO ABOUT HELL OKAY AND YOU KNOW MY PALM ON ROUND FOUR OF MY FOURTH GET TEACH MATH I HAVE A BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN PHYSICS AND THE WAY MASCOTS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT NO WAY ALERT AND SO WE'RE ALL TRYING TO PLAY CATCH UP ON THAT I JUST DON'T THINK THE SEA BASS IS CALLED OUT I THINK IT OUT DATED WELL THE COMMON CORE. YEAH MATHIS. THAN KNOWING HOW TO TEACH IT. I DON'T. DOUBT IT BUT WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASTRONAUT VOTE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU UP. THE I'LL LET YOU READ THE MOTION FOR THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED TO APPROPRIATIONS WE HAD THAT MOVED YEAH WE HAVE REMOVED IN SECONDS O'DONNELL BY. MADONNA I KILEY. KILEY NOT HURTING TALLY.

AND THAT'S FILE ITEM THIRTEEN. OF COURSE I AM NOT ASSEMBLY WOMAN GARCIA BUT PRESENTING FOR HER THIS MORNING I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS I'M HERE TO PRESENT AB. TWENTY NINE NINETY- FIRST I WANTED TO THANK THAT COMMITTEE STAFFER WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THIS MEASURE. AND STREAMLINING THE INTENT OF THIS AND WILL WE WILL BE ACCEPTING THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS OUTLINED ON PAGES SEVEN AND EIGHT TO THE ANALYSIS SO THANK YOU FOR THAT AS AMENDED THIS MEASURE PRESENTS TO BE A REASONABLE SOLUTION TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S CURRENT LACK OF OVERSIGHT. OF NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS OR HOME SCHOOL CHARTERS. AND FRANKLY ADDRESSES THE FOR A FLAGRANT MISUSE OF PUBLIC FUNDS TO VENDORS FOR EDUCATIONAL RICHMOND ACTIVITIES WE READ ABOUT THESE IN THE NEWS WERE TAXPAYER DOLLARS- PAY FOR ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES NOT TO GO LEARN ABOUT MOTHER NATURE BUT GO TO DISNEYLAND SEE WORLD AND HAVE- INTERACTIVE ACTIVITIES AT THEMES PARK SO THIS IS REALLY ABOUT TAX PAYER OVERSIGHT. AND EQUITY- CURRENTLY FAMILIES AND ROLLED IN NON CLASSROOM BASED CHARTER SCHOOLS RECEIVE STATE FUNDING TO OPERATE THEIR PROGRAMS THESE FIVE RANGE. TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED THIRTY TWO HUNDRED PER PEOPLE OF STATE TAX DOLLARS WITH NO GUIDANCE OR STANDARDS AND HOW THESE MONIES CAN BE SPENT. AS A WHAT THE RECRUIT SOME OF THE CHARTER SCHOOLS OFFER AND- TO PERSPECTIVE FAMILIES TO SHARE THE FUNDS WITH ERRANT'S FOREIGN CONNECT LIVE REALLY PUT ON. CRAIG'S THIS AND OTHER WEB BASED UP TO DISNEYLAND SEA WORLD IN THE TO. UP THE CIRCUIT COMPANY IS A ARE IN THE- THAT THAT OFFER THESE ARE. SEVENTIES STUDENTS AND HOME CHARTER SCHOOL WORKS. CHARTER SCHOOL IS AREA I WILL A DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF DATA IT'S A FEW YEARS AGO THE MOST RECENT WAS JUST OVER THREE HUNDRED AND- ONLY. A. YOU KNOW CERTAINLY HOME SCHOOLING IS SOMETHING THAT WE RESPECT AND WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE CAN CURRENTLY DO THAT BUT- TAXPAYER DOLLARS INVOLVED MAKE SURE THAT WE SHOULD HAVE. A PROPER OVERSIGHT AND A LACK OF OVERSIGHT RAISES QUESTIONS OF EQUITY. AND THE BEST USE OF OUR TAXPAYER DOLLARS EVERY STUDENT MATTERS ZIP CODES HAVE AN EQUAL LEARNING OPPORTUNITY AN APPROPRIATE EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES TO SUPPORT THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS- BUT WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THIS IS WITHIN REASON. OF THIS MEASURE PRESENTS A REASONABLE SALUTE AND TO ADDRESS THE STATE'S CURRENT LACK OF OVERSIGHT OF HOME SCHOOL CHARTERS. AND THE FLAGRANT MISUSE PUBLIC STORE EDUCATIONAL. FOR EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES- THIS BILL NO WAY WOULD RESTRICT OPPORTUNITIES FREHLEY ACE TO ENTER INTO VENDOR CONTRACTS FOR- SANCTIONED AND FRANKLY APPROPRIATE EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES JUST HAVE SOME MORE OVERSIGHT CLARITY- THE BILL WOULD SUPPORT THE QUALITY OF THE VENDOR SERVICES ENSURE THAT PUBLIC FUNDS ARE USED APPROPRIATELY FOR ACTIVITIES THAT BENEFIT OUR STUDENTS AND THEIR ACADEMIC SUCCESS AS AMENDED THE MEASURE PROVIDE QUALITY IS MEASURE FAMILIES. THAT ARE PROVIDED PUBLIC FUNDS FOR THESE ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES THROUGH HOME SCHOOL CHARTER SCHOOLS AGAIN THE FALLOUT FROM KOBE NINETEEN MAKES THIS BILL EVEN MORE RELEVANT AND NECESSARY WE WILL LIKELY SEE AN INCREASE ENROLLMENT OF NON CLASSROOM BASS SETTINGS BECAUSE OF THE PUBLIC CRISIS WERE FIXING AND MAKES THIS MEASURE BEFORE US EVEN MORE SO RELEVANT I KNOW I KNOW THAT THE IS NOT TODAY BUT BUT SHE BUT IT TO THE STE WORK HARD THE OFFICE. THEY COULD COME TO HUNDRED MEANING NINE A SHE TO J. THAT WORK HERE FOR A BIT LATE AND ME TO TODAY REMOTELY STRESSED BROWN WITH THE FEDERAL. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE. WE THINK WE'LL GO TO. MAY ONE IS IN SUPPORT MISTER BROWN. EYES WHICH IS DOWN IN THE ROW THE VIDEO ROOM. THANK YOU CHAIRED MA'AM MY NAME TRISTEN BROWN OF THE CAL BETTER OF T. AND WE KNOW MORE THAN EVER PARENTS HELP. OUR OUR MEMBERS HAVE BEEN HEARING WITHIN THEIR COMMUNITIES THE STORIES OF PARENTS STRUGGLING TO COPE WITH THE PANDEMIC. HATSUMI SAY RENEWED AWARENESS NOW OF THE VALUE THAT PUBLIC EDUCATORS PROVIDE STUDENTS ACROSS THE STATE. EVERYWHERE NOW PARENTS ARE STRUGGLING TO WALK DAYS IN THE SHOES OF A TEACHER OR CLASSIFIED CUSTODIAN FOOD SERVICE WORKER CLERICAL YOU NAME IT. AN ATTEMPT TO GUIDE THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH THE PATHWAYS OF DISTANCE LEARNING. WE KNOW HOW HARD IT IS BUT FOR MANY THIS TEMPORARY ISSUE WAS A LIFESTYLE THAT PARENTS HAVE CHOSEN FOR THEIR CHILDREN THE JEWS THE ROLL UP THEIR SLEEVES AND HEAVILY HOME SCHOOLED IT'S TO PROVIDE THE REGULAR NEEDED FOR SIX. LETTER IN LIFE. HOWEVER SEPARATE PATHS WERE MEANT IT'S ALSO AND JOE TO A IN NON CLASS BASED INSTRUCTION PRO. ESPECIALLY BY SCHOOLS PRODUCTS IN A STUDY PROGRAM INTO FULL FLEDGED TO COVER EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMS. HERE'S CERTAINLY A PLACE FOR INDEPENDENT LEARNING PROGRAM FOR SOME TYPES OF STUDENTS WITHIN OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. THE ISSUE COMES WHEN PUBLIC FUNDS ARE SPENT WITHOUT ANY OVERSIGHT AND WHAT MAY BE CALLED EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT ACTIVITIES BUT CERTAINLY STUDENTS ON INDEPENDENT STUDY TRACK SHOULD REAP THE BENEFITS OF TRADITIONAL FIELD TRIPS TO PLACES. LIKE ART PERFORMANCES OF MUSEUMS CENTERS OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY FOR EXAMPLE IS OUR SHARED HISTORY. HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN MANY SAMPLES HIGHLIGHTED RECENT NEWS REPORTS A SHELLAC OBJECTION BY SOME ALLOWED BY THE LACK OF OVERSIGHT FROM OURSELVES- I WON'T REPEAT WHAT MISTER MCCARTY IS JUST A LIST WITH YOU. AND WHILE THE SAFETY NOT ON THE- TO WHICH THE OTHER ONE WE DO HAVE ADEQUATE SUPPORT OVERSIGHT SHARED RESOURCES. NO NEED TO PREACH TO ALL OF YOU ABOUT FUNDING LEVELS OF OUR PUBLIC EDUCATION SYSTEM. IMPENDING CRISIS WILL PROVIDE. THANK MORE THAN EVER THE OVERSIGHT. SO THAT EVERY DOLLAR FOR THE STUDENTS AT A- AS THAT IS A KEY. TO OUR- CAN CORRECT FRAMEWORK. SO WE'D LIKE TO LEGISLATIVE MAXIM THAT PUBLIC AGENCIES AT THE STORE THE PUBLIC DOLLARS. NOT INDIVIDUAL PARENTS NOT PRIVATE CORPORATE BOARDS OF CHARTER SCHOOLS NOT EVEN ALL OF OUR MEMBERS THAT ARE TEACHERS THROUGHOUT THE THOUSANDS OF CLASSROOMS THAT EXIST. AND SO TO THAT END WE SUPPORT THE REASON A MEMBER TO THIS BILL THAT BRING PARITY AMONG TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN CHARTERS. SAFEGUARD THE FIRST AMENDMENT BY PROTECTING OUR PUBLIC DOLLARS FROM PRIVATE RELIGIOUS SCHOOLS. AND RESPECT THE LOCAL CONTROL. LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO DETERMINE WHAT OUR PROGRAM EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT PROGRAM BENDER. TRANSPARENCY PUBLIC CONTRACTING IN THE USE OF PUBLIC FUNDS. WELL FLEXIBILITY pEDUCATION IS ONE THING. FLEXIBILITY ON THE QUALITY OF SPENDING PUBLIC DOLLARS IS A WHOLE OTHER. SO WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE ON ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY NINE NINETY. RIGHT YOU.

OPPOSING THE BILL MAIN WITNESSES IS THE MAIN WITNESSES- AND ALICE KESSLER IS I BELIEVE ON THE PHONE. SO ALICE YOU ARE AND YOU MAY PROCEED WITH YOUR- TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR- AL CATHARINE BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOLS ASSOCIATION. YES THEY ARE TAKING ON OPPOSE IN LAS AMENDED POSITION ON AB TWO NINE NINE- SHE CAN'T TAKE KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THERE'S BEEN SOME BAD PRACTICES WITH RESPECT TO VENDORS AND IN FACT WE WERE ONE OF THE EARLY WHISTLE BLOWERS THAT ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE INDICTMENT OF LEADERS OF THE H. THREE SCHOOLS. WE HAVE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND WE THANK HER FOR THAT WORKING WITH OUR MEMBERSHIP WE OFFER A FRAMEWORK TO ENSURE REGRETS AND TRANSPARENT PROCESS FOR VENDOR QUALITY STUDENT SAFETY AND A CLEAR CONNECTION OF ACTIVITIES TO THE STUDENTS WORK PLAN AS APPROVED BY THE TEACHER. SO WHILE WE APPRECIATE THE SPIRIT OF THIS BILL AND MANY OF OUR SUGGESTIONS HAVE BEEN INCORPORATED WE UNFORTUNATELY MUST OPPOSE SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OVER PRESCRIPTIVE AND COSTLY AT A CHALLENGING TIME FOR ALL ELLIE AIDS WHICH THIS BILL APPLIES TO. FIRST THE BILL OF THE MEN. WOULD IMPOSE NEW CONTRACT CODE REQUIREMENTS THAT NOT ONLY REACH FAR BEYOND THE BILL STATED INTENT. WOULD ALSO VIOLATE THE SPIRIT OF THE AGREEMENT RECENTLY REACHED ON CHARTER SCHOOL OPERATIONS IN EIGHTY FOUR OF SIX FIFTEEN OH FIVE. AND THAT'S THE ONE TWENTY SIX PERMITS FROM PREVIOUS SESSIONS. WE ALSO OPPOSE RECOMMENDATIONS RELATED TO AUTHORIZE YOUR APPROVAL OF TRYING TO GET ALL OF THE- ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE PROCESS OF THE MATERIAL REVISION. ORDER WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE OPERATOR CAN NOTICE AND HOLD A PUBLIC HEARING AND MANDATED SPOT AUDIT. OPERATORS ALREADY HAVE BROAD DISCRETION TO REVIEW POLICIES OF A CHARTER SCHOOL AND TAKE ACTION INCLUDING REVOCATION OR NON RENEWAL AT FISCAL VIOLATIONS ARE NOT ADDRESSED. YET THEY'VE CONCERNED ABOUT THE LACK OF CLARITY IN THE SCOPE IN TERMINOLOGY OF THE BILL TERMS LIKE EDUCATIONAL ENRICHMENT ACTIVITY AND THE PROHIBITION ON RECEIVING SIR. RIGHT ALL AND FISCAL INCENTIVES FOR TEACHERS ARE EITHER TOO BROAD OR TOO VAGUE EVEN WHERE WE SHARE THE AUTHOR'S GOAL. FINALLY WE NOTE THE CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW PUBLIC EDUCATION MAY BE DELIVERED AND FUNDED MOVING FORWARD ALL ELLIE AIDS WILL NEED OPTIMAL FLEXIBILITY TO OFFER INNOVATIVE SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS IN THE KOBE CRISIS. THIS BILL SEEMS TO MOVE IN THE WRONG DIRECTION FOR THIS MOMENT THAT WE THEREFORE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR KNOW ABOUT AN EIGHTY TWENTY NINE NINETY THANK YOU. THANK YOU WE HAVE ANOTHER WITNESS IN OPPOSITION ON THE PHONE AND THEN IS. ERIC PREMAXILLA FROM THE CHARTER SCHOOL DEVELOPMENT CENTER. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS- ERIC BRING BACK WITH THE CHARTER SCHOOL OF THOUGHT MEANT CENTER WHERE A TWENTY SEVEN YEAR OLD. LEADERSHIP DEVELOPMENT AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION REPRESENTING SEVERAL HUNDRED SCHOOLS IN THE STATE- MANY OF OUR MEMBERS DO MAKE EXTENSIVE USE OF VENDORS BOTH THE TRADITIONAL BRICK AND MORTAR SCHOOLS AND TO THE- HOME BASE SUPPORT SCHOOLS. AND IN. LARGE PART THERE ARE MANY OF THEM HAVE BEEN VERY ACCESSIBLE WHEN TRANSITIONING TO DISTANCE LEARNING AND THAT'S EMERGENCY IN PART BECAUSE OF THEIR RELATIONSHIPS WITH VENDORS- WE I ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THERE HAVE BEEN SOME ABUSES IN THIS AREA. WE THINK THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE VIGOROUS PROSECUTION THAT'S ALREADY GOING ON- PLUS THE WORK THAT WE'VE BEEN DOING AND SEE IF THEY AND OTHERS HAVE BEEN DOING THE MEMBERS- ARE STAMPING OUT NEARLY ALL OF THAT. AND WE BELIEVE THAT THE BILL AS AMENDED IS KIND OF A MASS FRANKLY IT WOULD SETTLE THE STATE SUPERINTENDENT WITH THE RESPONSIBILITIES THAT THEY'RE CLEARLY NOT- CAPABLE OF SEEING THROUGH. WE DO SEE SOME MERIT THEN THE SUGGESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- WE DO SUPPORT THE NOTION OF HAVING A PROPER VETTING PROCEDURE. AND WE ALSO SUPPORT PROHIBITIONS ON- RELIGIOUS AND SECTARIAN INSTRUCTIONAL MATERIALS- BUT WE OPPOSE THE NUMBER OF THE OTHER SUGGESTIONS IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS- FOR EXAMPLE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WOULD PROHIBIT PROVIDING INCENTIVES FOR. TEACHERS TO ENROLL IN RETAIN STUDENTS AND WE THINK IT CAN BE. ENTIRELY IMPROPRIETIES IF NOT- VERY HELPFUL TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR TEACHERS WHO ARE UNUSUALLY SUCCESSFUL. WHEN THEY DO SO WITH STUDENTS WHO MIGHT OTHERWISE DROP OUT- MIGHT NOT BE. SIX ALL. AND SO THOSE ANOTHER REASON WE THAT THE BILL AND IT'S CURRENT. AND THEN THAT SUGGESTED AMENDED FORM- IT SHOULD BE HELD AND- SHOULD NOT MOVE FORWARD AND THEREFORE WE ASK FOR A NO VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU- WITH THAT WHEN WE GO TO WITNESSES IN THE ROOM THAT ARE IN OPPOSITION IF YOU WISH TO TESTIFY- THE BAIT SHARE YOUR OPINION IS NOT I. DID NOT TIME TO TESTIFY AGAIN WE'VE HEARD FROM THE TOMB IN WITNESSES IN THIS TOO MANY WE HAVE A RULE WE HAVE TWO MAIN WITNESSES. THAT ARE TO BE TEACHERS. SO WE'RE DOING NOW IS. HER THE ROOM THAT WAS TO APPROACH THE MICROPHONE WITHOUT TOUCHING IT PLEASE- INJURE SHARE THEIR NAME AFFILIATION AND POSITION ON THE BILL ONLY ONLY THEY'RE WELCOME TO DO SO NOW. PLEASE MAINTAIN DISTANCING IF YOU WISH TO DO SO. RAISE YOUR HAND NOW IF YOU WISH TO DO SO SEEING NO HANDS UP WE'LL MOVE ON. GET THEIR HANDS UP THEN.

I'M LET'S BRING IT BACK TO COMMITTEE THAT WAS A LOT COMMENTS ARE SO YOU FOR ALL PUBLIC PUBLIC REFER TO I KNOW THIS IS A PERFECT I KNOW TOOK A LITTLE BIT AWAY BUT SOME. DEMOCRACY WERE SO I APPRECIATE PEOPLE- OF PARTICIPATING IN THIS PROCESS- SO WE'LL BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR A COUPLE QUESTIONS- ANALYST'S OFFICE HAS COUPLE QUESTIONS. MR MCCARTY AYE AYE AYE YOU KNOW WHAT MADE A COMMON MEDICAL I DON'T REALLY SEE THIS IS- AN ANTI HOME SCHOOL BILL AT ALL ACTUALLY I SEE THIS IS A PRO HOME SCHOOL BILL. BECAUSE OF I'M SOMEONE WHO SUPPORTS HOME SCHOOLING I WANTED TO BE. APPROPRIATE I WANTED TO BE FUNDED ADEQUATELY I WANT THOSE DOLLARS TO BE SPENT. TO BE SPENT ON ON ON THE EDUCATION OF THE STUDENTS AN APPROPRIATE PLACE I WANT ACCOUNTABILITY I WANT OVERSIGHT AND THAT THAT'S WHAT FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THAT'S WHAT THIS BILL DOES AND I DON'T THINK I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT MAYBE YOU CAN SHARE WITH US BUT I DON'T YOUR I DON'T SEE WAS AND I HOME SCHOOL. THE AUTHOR IS NOT AND I HOME SCHOOL DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT STATEMENT NO I CONCUR THAT. MISTER. I'M BEING HACKED. EMAILS THAT. I AM PLACE QUITE. RIGHT NOW THANK YOU THANK YOU. AND I WAS ADVISED THAT THERE NO WILL PEOPLE ON WHERE WE FORWARD I THAT THE- MISTER CHAIR I WAS GONNA THAT MOST IN. THAT ARE PART OF THE HOME SCHOOL NEVER IN CALIFORNIA HER TESTIFYING HAVE NOTHING TO WORRY ABOUT THIS GOES AFTER QUALITY CONTROLS WITH SOME OF THE BAD ACTORS AS THE OP THIS IN NOTED TO. THERE WERE THERE WERE THERE WERE SOME YOU KNOW SOME OF THE SOME OF THE EXAMPLES ARE JUST OUTRAGEOUS LIKE IN THE ANALYSIS WHERE PEOPLE GO ONLINE AND SAYING HEY IF YOU'RE IN CALIFORNIA YOU'RE NOT TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS. I DON'T KNOW WHAT SAY YOU CAN USE THIS TO GET MONIES FOR THINGS LIKE DISNEYLAND CHICAGO CITY PASS AND LOCAL AND TICKETS AND SO THAT. CLEARLY ABUSE OF. PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS AND MAKING IT BAD FOR THE HOME SCHOOL FAMILIES THAT ARE THAT ARE IT RIGHT AND SO THIS HAS THE NEEDED CLEAN UPS AND FOCUSING ON SOME PROCEDURES ALL MAKE SENSE LIKE KICK BACKS TO. TEACHERS AND FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE- PROPER- YOU KNOW- GUIDANCE AS FAR AS HOW TO USE THOSE RESOURCES. THANK YOU I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE TO THE STATEMENT. PUBLIC PUBLIC TAG PUBLIC SCHOOL DOLLARS A PUBLIC TAXPAYERS DOLLARS FOR SURE THEY ALSO MEANT FOR KIDS. AND THEY SHOULDN'T BE SPENT A SET OF FAMILY TO CHICAGO FOR THE WEEKEND TO VISIT A MUSEUM AND HAVE A GOOD TIME IN CHICAGO YOU WOULD AGREE WITH THAT. I WOULD AND I JUST WANT TO NOTE MAYBE COUPLE THINGS ON THE- THE OPPOSITION BECAUSE- THAT. FIRST OF ALL I'M NOT THE AUTHOR IS YOU KNOW BUT I'VE BEEN COMMUNICATING. WITH HER AND HER TEAM LITERALLY AS WE SPEAK HERE. AND THE THERE'S A LOT OF RESPECT IF THINGS ARE COMING BACK IN BUT THERE'SNOT THERE'S SOME DIFFERENCES TIAS THAT I KNOW THAT THAT THE FIRST OFFICE IN THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION TALKED ABOUT. BEING OPPOSE A LESS AMENDED. THERE IS A ONE PIECE IN THERE AS FAR AS- THE TEACHERS. INCENTIVES THE OTHER GROUP THE TESTIFIED. DIDN'T LIKE THAT PIECE AND SO THERE'S CONFLICTING MESSAGES FROM SOME OF THE OPPOSITION GROUPS AND SO I KNOW THE AUTHOR IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM AND- TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT WE FOCUS ON THE OVERALL. GOAL OF THIS IS CLARIFYING STATE TAX DOLLARS TO PROTECT THE TAXPAYERS AND STUDENTS. AND FRANKLY THERE'S PROBABLY GIVE ME MORE THESE ENTITIES OUT THERE AND SO IT'S TIME. THAT WE DO THIS NOW IT'S REALLY- TWO SIDES OF THE COIN THOUGHT. IN THE COPA CRISIS SOME MAY SAY THIS TOO MUCH PAPERWORK GOING ON RIGHT NOW. IT'S SO WE DON'T HAVE ANY MORE BURDENS ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN CHARTERS- AUTHORIZED I MEMBER CHARTERS NETWORKS AS FAR AS- HOW TO USE THESE MONIES BUT ALSO IN THIS CRISIS THERE IS A NEED TO PROTECT TAXPAYER DOLLARS. RIGHT AND THE OTHER HAS WORKED. AS SPEND A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF TIME OF THE CALIFORNIA CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION WORKING ON THIS BILL IN FACT THEY'VE CHANGED IN HELP. MODIFY THIS BILL INTO FASHION MORE TO THEIR LIKING THAT ON IN SUPPORT TODAY BUT EVEN THEY ALLUDED TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE PROBLEMS. HOW HOME SCHOOL. SOME HOST SOMEONE ONCE A SENSE IT'S NOT ALL LET'S BE CLEAR SOME HOMES TO ORGANIZATIONS ARE SPENDING THEIR MONEY SO THE CHARTER SCHOOL ASSOCIATION HAS BEEN INVOLVED AND CONTINUES TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS PROCESS- AS I UNDERSTAND IS THAT A FACT. CORRECT CORRECT AND AS I NOTED THERE IS ONE PROVISION THAT AMENDMENT THAT THEY TOOK IN THERE. RELATED TO INCENTIVES GOING TO TEACHERS WHICH WAS THAT THE SUGGESTION. OF THE ASSOCIATION AND THAT. PROVISION IN THERE IS NOW OPPOSED BY WHAT THE OTHER GROUPS OPPOSING HE BILL SO. SOMETIMES YOU HAVE TO. SET TO SORT THIS OUT WITH AND- I THINK THE SHE STATED THAT SHE IS COMMITTED TO WORKING WITH THEM AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS. AND I CAN'T IMAGINE LISTEN I'M A CLASSROOM TEACHER AND I CAN'T IMAGINE THAT I AS A TEACHER WOULD GET MONEY. FROM A SCHOOL DISTRICT OR AN OUTSIDE ORGANIZATION TO RECRUIT STUDENTS. INTO SOME OUTSIDE ACTIVITY I THINK THAT WOULD BE PRETTY NEFARIOUS WRONG AND- SETS UP A LOT OF BAD THINGS COULD COME OUT OF THAT. CORRECT ME IN I THINK YOU WOULD AGREE THAT IF THERE IS A VENDOR IN THE AFTER SCHOOL OVER THERE NEED TO BE OVERSIGHT ACCOUNTABILITY. THESE FOLKS MIGHT EVEN NEED TO BE BACKGROUND CHECK BECAUSE WHAT WE'RE DOING IS SENDING KIDS OFF TO MAYBE HORSEBACK RIDING LESSONS ETCETERA. HEY AND SOME THESE OPERATORS NIGHT MIGHT NOT EVEN HAVE BACKGROUND CHECKS SO I THINK I THINK WE NEED IT THAT CONVERSATION NEEDS TO BE HAD AND THAT'S WHAT THIS. THIS BILL IS ABOUT AND BOB IN ESSENCE SHOULDN'T BE PAID TO SEND THEIR KID TO A CERTAIN SCHOOL I MEAN THAT'S THAT'S IN SOME INSTANCES WHAT DOES BEEN ALLUDED TO IF YOU ARE GETTING A MATERIAL GOD TO SEND THEIR CHILD TO A CERTAIN INSTITUTION AND THAT IS NOT WHAT WE SHOULD BE DOING. WITH PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS AND AGAIN I I'D I'D MAYBE I CAN'T SPEAK FOR ANYONE HERE BUT I DON'T THE ANYONE'S NECESSARILY AGAINST HOME SCHOOL RIGHT HEY IT'S HAPPENING EVERYWHERE ALL THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RIGHT NOW- IT WE'RE ALL RIGHT YOU'RE ALL HOME SCHOOLERS TODAY RIGHT I'VE GOT TO- AND HEY MIGHT HOME SCHOOLING BE AN OPTION FOR ME THE FUTURE IT MIGHT BUT AT THE SAME TIME I WANT. THESE GOOD GOVERNMENT PRACTICES IN PLACE TO PROTECT THE PUBLIC TAX DOLLARS THAT ARE GOING TO SUPPORT THESEEFFORTS BUT ALSO TO PROTECT THE CHILDREN SO THAT THAT THAT'S THE PERSPECTIVE I BRING- IS SO WITH THAT I'M GOING TO ASK IF THERE'S ANY OTHER COMMITTEE MEMBERS I WISH TO ASK QUESTIONS TO KIND. MR TO THERE ARE STILL A CUP. WHO TO LIKE. BECOME A IPOD I DID SEE THEIR AT THE BASED HERE. OKAY WE'RE GONNA GO MISTER COLIN GOT THOSE IN JUST A MINUTE GOING. KIND OF. WHAT WE THINK GIVE TO SOMEONE WANT TO COME. I AM. HEARING OR NOT YOU. OKAY NOW JERRY HERE MISTER. OKAY DID ANYONE ELSE WANT TO COME RIGHT NOW. FROM IT BUT I BEEN WITH. AND I READ THIS THE PRIME THAT GIVE THEM SOME OF THIS OF THE FACT OF WHATEVER THE LAW WE'RE TO HAVE. IN. RIGHT I GUESS THAT'S MY CONCERN IS THAT THIS IS IT TOOK ME INFO ME AS WE IT IT TOOK ME SO MANY DIRECTIONS AND WHAT I CAN DO THAT READING IT NOT ONLY ONE. FIVE THREE SEVEN COULDN'T FIGURE WERE WELL. I MEAN I DIDN'T KNOW IF THE OF. SEE IT IN ITS SIMPLEST FORM. THEN I HAVE A THOUSAND QUESTIONS ABOUT WHAT DOES IT RELATE TO THESE FOLKS VERSES THESE FOLKS VERSES THIS EXPERIENCE FOR THAT EXPERIENCE AND WHERE DOES IT TAKE ME IN THE IN. AND SO I JUST HAD SOME YOU KNOW I DIDN'T FEEL LIKE THE BILL WAS READY YET AND THEN IT'S JUST ME THINKING THAT THAT THEY WERE THERE WITH THAT OBVIOUSLY THERE ARE SOME. ISSUES HERE. BUT THIS BILL DOESN'T CLARIFIED STRONGLY ENOUGH SO THAT IT GIVES PEOPLE SOME. SINCE THE IT'S GOING TO FOCUS ON THIS AND SOLVE PROBLEM FOR US OR THE GOING TO CREATE MORE PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT'S SO BROUGHT IN ITS NOT CLEARLY DEFINE WELL ENOUGH TO REALLY GET TO THE PROBLEM AND I FELT LIKE IT WAS IN SEARCH OF A PROBLEM AND SO. I JUST HAD SOME AND I AND I GUESS THAT I READ IT ONCE ABOUT MAYBE I WAS TIRED SO I. PUT IT DOWN READ IT LATER ON IF HOURS. AND THEY WILL UP THIS MORNING AND READ IT AGAIN. AND SO I. HAVE I JUST I JUST WANT. THE MAYBE YOU CAN CLARIFY IT BECAUSE THAT'S THAT'S A DID SPEAK THE OFFICE. AND ASKED A NUMBER. AS IT APPLIES ALL TO IN THE TO EL EVERY DESTROY AT THE JUST TO TRY. HOME SCHOOLING AND LIKE TO. AND THEN. THEN THE QUESTION BE OKAY WILL THAT HOW WE- THE SIX. OR WHATEVER AND A AND IT MAY I DON'T IT'S WORTH THING IN THE WORLD HIS GO DISNEYLAND MAYBE AT THE BECAUSE SEEN THEM A CITY. WERE HAVING CERTAIN XP. WERE CREEK. OF WHAT I WAS A KID IN THE PRIDE WE HAD A LOT OF EXTRA. THAT WE NEVER WOULD GOTTEN OTHER. IN AND SOME OF WHICH RELATE TO OUR CREW. IT WAS A EDUCATE WE WANT TO THE I. AND THIS IN THIS IS ALSO A OF. I'M JUST TRYING TO FIGURE. WHERE DOES THIS BILL LEE. ME AN AND WE'LL IT. MORE BY LIMIT. FOLK WHO ARE. OF WHO WANT TO DO THINGS IN SCHOOL. AND MAYBE IT'S- ON THE- LIVE. OF BIG. ALL OF US. YOU KNOW THEY'VE GOT AN OPPORTUNITY. TO DO SO. THAT CAN'T. AND A BECAUSE AND I DON'T LIST. YOU KNOW SO I DON'T REALLY SURE WHO. WE'RE THIS TAKES ME MAYBE. CAN CALL. FOR ME. RIGHT AFTER. ON IT DANI A BIG PROBLEM IS AND WHY OR NOT THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE IT AND NEED. WHO I TALKING TO. GO BOOK. RIGHT NOW THIS IN YOUR BILL ANYWAY I'LL SO I JUST I'M THINK THAT'S BEING A PART OF ME OKAY CHRISTY BUT ANYWAY SO JUST TRYING TO OUT.

TO DOCTOR WEB IS CA. THAT A FEW QUESTIONS IF THE MAIN ONE THAT THAT I THINK THAT. I CAN ANSWER RIGHT NOW IS TO DO THIS. TO VISIT PICK AND CHOOSE. WHO WERE SO. CALLED GOING AFTER A NOW IT'S NOT JUST.
