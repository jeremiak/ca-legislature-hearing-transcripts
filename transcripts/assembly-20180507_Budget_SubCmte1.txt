I'D LIKE TO ENTERTAIN A MOTION ON ISSUE ONE. TO TAKE ACTION ON THE BUDGET CHANGE PROPOSAL REGARDING LOW INCOME WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM REPORT APPROPRIATION. LOOKING FOR A SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND ON ISSUE ONE I'D LIKE US TO PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. ARAMBULA AYE HARPER. AND MATHIS RUBIO. WOULD. THE US FOR VOTES AND IS NOW MOVED AND TAKEN ACTION ON. WILL MOVE TO ISSUE TO. GOOD AFTERNOON THANK YOU. MISTER WOOD AND MISTER ARE ASSEMBLY MEMBER WHEN ASSEMBLY MEMBER ARAMBULA. OKAY. AS THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUBCOMMITTEE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I AM VERY EXCITED TO ANNOUNCE THAT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSEMBLY. WE'LL BE TAKING STEPS TODAY TO MAKE A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN HEALTH CARE. TODAY WE WILL BE PROPOSING TO TAKE ACTION ON A PACKET OF HEALTH CARE INITIATIVES. THAT WILL RESULT AND INVESTMENT OF JUST OVER ONE BILLION DOLLARS. THIS INVESTMENT IS HISTORIC AND UNPRECEDENTED AND WILL MOVE US FORWARD. TODAY'S ACTION ON THESE PROPOSALS SHOWS THAT THE ASSEMBLY IS COMMITTED TO IMPROVING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. WE ALSO RECOGNIZE THAT THIS IS JUST THE NEXT STEP. I AM HONORED TO VOTERS TO BE PRESENTING THESE PROPOSALS TODAY ALONGSIDE. MY COLLEAGUE ASSEMBLY MEMBER JIM WOOD. AS CO CHAIRS OF THE SELECT COMMITTEE ON HEALTH CARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS AND UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. DOCTOR WOULDN'T I HAVE SPENT MOST OF THE LAST SEVEN MONTHS FOCUSED ON THIS ISSUE. WE HOLD SEVEN HEARINGS AND OVER THIRTY HOURS OF TESTIMONY HEARING FROM EXPERTS FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY ABOUT THE WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR HEALTHCARE DELIVERY SYSTEMS. WE IDENTIFIED BOTH SHORT AND LONG TERM GOALS WHICH HAVE RESULTED IN A NUMBER OF BILLS BEING INTRODUCED THIS YEAR. AND WE HAVE IDENTIFIED BUDGETARY OPTIONS THAT WILL GET US CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. TODAY WE ARE PRESENTING A PACKAGE OF HEALTHCARE INITIATIVES THAT WILL RESULT IN AN INVESTMENT OF JUST OVER ONE BILLION. THIS PACKAGE OF ITEMS WILL EXPAND COVERAGE. MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE AFFORDABLE AND PROVIDE MORE ACCESS TO CARE GETTING US CLOSER TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. SPECIFICALLY. WITH AN EXPANDING TO COVERAGE WE ARE PROPOSING TO APPROVE TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. TO EXTEND MEDI CAL TO LOW INCOME YOUNG ADULTS AGE NINETEEN THROUGH TWENTY FIVE. WHO ARE UNDOCUMENTED AND INCOME ELIGIBLE? THIS BUILDS ON OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND COVERAGE AND REDUCE THE LEVELS OF UNINSURED. IT IS ALSO THE NEXT LOGICAL STEP AFTER WE. EXPANDED MEDICAL COVERAGE TO ALL CHILDREN THROUGH THE AGE OF EIGHTEEN. THIS WILL ALSO ALIGN WITH WHAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S DID IT WHEN IT ENACTED THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. WHEN IT REQUIRED INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR YOUNG ADULTS UNTIL THE AGE OF TWENTY SIX. I WANT TO UNDERSCORE THAT I AM COMMITTED TO WORKING ON EXPANDING HEALTH CARE ACCESS TO ALL OF OUR UNDOCUMENTED AN INCOME ELIGIBLE CALIFORNIANS. THIS IS JUST THE NEXT STEP. BUT KNOW THAT THERE WILL BE MORE STEPS TO COME SO WE CAN HAVE HEALTH FOR ALL. ALSO IN EXPANDING COVERAGE WE ARE PROPOSING TO EXPAND MEDI CAL ENROLLMENT TO NINETY THOUSAND CHILDREN AND THIRTEEN THOUSAND PREGNANT WOMEN. BY SPENDING TWENTY SIX MILLION TO STREAMLINE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY TO UNINSURED CALIFORNIA CHILDREN AND PREGNANT WOMEN WHO ARE ENROLLING IN THE WOMEN INFANTS AND CHILDREN NUTRITION PROGRAM. FAR PROPOSED PACKAGE ALSO INCLUDES THIRTY MILLION TO EXPAND MEDICAL COVERAGE TO THE TWENTY THOUSAND SENIORS AND DISABLED PEOPLE. WHOSE INCOME LEVELS ARE BETWEEN A HUNDRED AND TWENTY THREE PERCENT AND A HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. EXPANDING COVERAGE TO THIS POPULATION INSURERS THAT THIS POPULATION THAT IS ELIGIBLE FOR MEDI CAL. DOES NOT LOSE THEM SOLELY DUE TO THEIR AGE. THIS WILL HELP THOUSANDS OF VULNERABLE INDIVIDUALS ACCESS THE CARE THAT THEY NEED. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE LOW INCOME SENIORS THAN ADULTS WITH DISABILITIES. AREN'T HAVING TO CHOOSE BETWEEN PUTTING FOOD ON THE TABLE AND GOING TO THE DOCTOR. LASTLY WITHIN EXPANDING ACCESS WE WILL EXTEND TRANSITIONAL MEDI CAL FROM SIX MONTHS TO TWELVE MONTHS. FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRANSITIONING OFF OF CAL WORKS. WE WANTED TO MAKE SURE THAT IS FAMILY'S MOVE OUT OF POVERTY WE PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL BUFFER PERIOD. SO THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT PAYING FOR HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS OR OUT OF POCKET COSTS. WHILE THEY'RE TRYING TO BECOME FINANCIALLY STABLE. I AM PLEASED TO HAVE TO JOIN DR ARAMBULA IN PRESENTING POLLS OF THAT WE BELIEVE REPRESENTS A MAJOR INVESTMENT IN HEALTHCARE AND A COMMITMENT TO ALL CALIFORNIANS. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE WHAT I HOPE WILL BE THE FIRST STEPS IN BUDGETARY ACTIONS TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. COVERAGE IS NOT CARE. AND THAT IS WHY THESE MULTIPLE POLICY INITIATIVES FOCUSED ON OUR PURSUIT OF THE LONGER TERM STRUCTURAL CHANGES NEEDED IN ORDER TO ASSURE. INCREASED ACCESS CARE AND AFFORDABILITY. TODAY'S ACTIONS ALL TOGETHER WILL SUPPORT ALL OF THESE GOALS AND BY PROVING AFFORDABILITY ACCOUNTABILITY AND TRANSPARENCY AS WELL AS INCREASE WORKFORCE CAPACITY. THIS PACKAGE INCLUDES OVER FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO HELP FAMILIES PAY FOR PREMIUMS THROUGH COVER CALIFORNIA. IT WILL PROVIDE PRINT PREMIUM ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES AND COVER CALIFORNIA WHOSE WHOSE HOUSEHOLD INCOME IS BETWEEN TWO HUNDRED TO FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL. CURRENTLY FAMILIES IN THOSE INCOME LEVELS RECEIVE ASSISTANCE TO COVER CALIFORNIA BUT STILL STRUGGLE TO AFFORD HEALTH CARE BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER PREMIUMS AND OUT OF POCKET COSTS. INCLUDING LARGE DEDUCTIBLES ASSOCIATED WITH MOST COMMON CHOICE OF A BRONZE PLAN WHICH REQUIRES OUT OF POCKET COSTS ABOUT MORE THAN SIX THOUSAND PERSON. SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PERSON PER YEAR. LOS INCLUDE ASSISTANCE TO FAMILIES AND COVER CALIFORNIA WHO DON'T RECEIVE ANY FINANCIAL SUPPORT THIS TIME. WE'RE PROPOSING A REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT FOR PEOPLE WHOSE INCOME BETWEEN FOUR HUNDRED AND SIX ON A PERCENT OF THE FEDERATED WILL POVERTY LEVEL. FOUR HUNDRED PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL IS APPROXIMATELY SIXTY SIX THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR A MARRIED COUPLE. IN SOME CASES THESE FAMILIES ARE SPENDING MORE THAN TWENTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS IN OUT OF POCKET COSTS TO COVER CALIFORNIA. OUR PROPOSAL ASSURES THAT FAMILIES WON'T HAVE TO DECIDE BETWEEN PAYING RENT OR THEIR HEALTHCARE PREMIUMS. TO MAKE THIS WORK WE MUST INVENT ITS MASS INVEST IN WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT TO BALANCE EXPANSION OF COVERAGE WITH AVAILABILITY OF HEALTHCARE PROVIDERS NEEDED TO PROVIDE TREATMENT. CURRENTLY CALIFORNIA HAS IT INADEQUATE PRIMARY CARE WORKFORCE TO MEET OUR DEMANDING HEALTH COURT CARE NEEDS. ARE A. TO BOLSTER OUR MEDICAL WORKFORCE OVER THE YEARS WE PROPOSE FIFTY FOUR MILLION DOLLARS IN ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR THE SONG BROWN PROGRAM OVER THE NEXT THREE YEARS AS WELL A THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE UC. PROGRAMS IN MEDICAL EDUCATIONAL CALL PRIME. ADDITIONAL FUNDING FOR SONG BROWN WILL HELP INCREASE THE NUMBER OF FAMILY PRACTICE PHYSICIANS. PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS NURSE PRACTITIONERS AND OUR ENDS IN MEDICALLY UNS ANNOUNCE UNDERSERVED AREAS BY FINANCIALLY SUPPORTING RESIDENCY PROGRAMS IN THOSE AREAS. EXPANDING FUNDING FOR PRIME ALLOWS ADDITIONAL FULL TIME STUDENT ENROLLMENT IN THESE THIS INITIATIVE TRAINING PROGRAM DESIGNED TO TRAIN SOCIALLY CONSCIOUS STUDENTS. AS FUTURE COME CLINICIANS FOCUSED ON UNDERSERVED POPULATIONS IN BOTH RURAL AND URBAN AREAS. AND FINALLY WE ARE REQUESTING APPROVAL OF FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS TO ESTABLISH AN ALL PAYER PASSED PAYMENTS DATABASE THAT IS NEEDED TO GATHER INFORMATION ON THE ACTUAL COST OF HEALTHCARE SERVICES. ESPECIALLY PAYMENTS MADE A POSITION SO THAT WE CAN ACHIEVE TRANSPARENCY IN HEALTHCARE PAYMENTS. AND BEGIN TO CONTAIN COSTS ALL TOTAL THIS GROUP THE QUESTION MOUNTS TO JUST OVER BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT IN HEALTHCARE. UNNECESSARY AND CRITICAL INVESTMENT IN CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE SYSTEM. THANK YOU IS THERE ANY WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. I. GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS TAMRON AND WHAT HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA THE STATE WIDE HEALTH CARE CONSUMER ADVOCACY COALITION WORKING FOR QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE ARE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THE PROPOSAL PRESENTED BY DOCTORS WHAT IT ARAMBULA. CALIFORNIA'S UNINSURED RATE IS AT A HISTORIC LOW THANKS TO A ROBUST IMPLEMENTATION OF THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THIS PROPOSAL MOVES WITH. TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU TO FURTHER REFINE AND DEVELOP THIS PROPOSAL. FIRST WE ARE VERY THRILLED AT THE ASSEMBLY AS COMMITTED TO COVERING MORE UNDOCUMENTED ADULTS AND MEDI CAL WE HAVE ADVOCATED FOR REMOVING MEDICAID AS UNFAIR EXCLUSION OF UNDOCUMENTED IMMIGRANTS ENTIRELY AND THE ASSEMBLY PROPOSAL. TO COVER YOUNG ADULTS TO AGE TWENTY SIX AND IS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD. WE BELIEVE ANOTHER PRIOR TO POPULATION. THAT'S A BECAUSE IT WOULD BE A OLDER ADULTS WHO HAVE MORE MEDICAL NEEDS. SECOND WE ARE DELIGHTED TO SEE THE PROPOSAL TO IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY OF PREMIUMS AND THE INDIVIDUAL MARKETS. THE AFFORDABLE CARE ACT HAS HELPED MILLIONS TO GET AND KEEP COVERAGE BUT IN THE HIGH COST IT LIKE CALIFORNIA MORE FINANCIAL HELP IS NEEDED. PROVIDING HELP FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE LESS THAN FOUR HAD A PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL OR FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS AS AN INDIVIDUAL TO AFFORD THE PREMIUMS AS AN IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD SO THAT MORE OF THE REMAINING UNINSURED. BECOME INSURED AND THOSE WHO HAVE COVERAGE NOW CAN BETTER AFFORD IT. PROVIDING HELP FOR PEOPLE WHO MAKE OVER FOR HER TO PERCENT OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LEVEL WHO CURRENTLY DO NOT QUALIFY FOR ANY FEDERAL SUBSIDIES AT ALL IS ALSO CRITICAL. THESE PEOPLE UP EARNED ABOUT FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL OR SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR FOR A MARRIED COUPLE. AND BOTH DOCTOR WHAT THE AND BOTH ADVOCATES IT SHOULD LOOK AT BOTH. DOCTOR WOULD A DOCTOR ASSEMBLY I'M DOCTOR ARAMBULA. ASSEMBLY DISTRICTS AMERICA WILL YOU KNOW BOTH AGE SIXTY TWO MAKING SOME THOUSAND DOLLARS A YEAR WHICH IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY ARTS CURRENTLY SPENDING YOU KNOW ANYWHERE FROM LIKE TWENTY EIGHT SO LIKE THE FORTY PERCENT OF THEIR INCOME ON PREMIUMS. AND DEDUCTIBLES ALONE AND YOU KNOW THE OF THE PROPOSAL WAS PRESENTED HERE TODAY WOULD. HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS AND WE BELIEVE THAT CAPITAL PREMIUMS WOULD BE IT'LL SOMETHING THAT WOULD. MAKE HEALTH WILL BE THE FIRST IN THE NATION TO. HELP. APPROVE AFFORDABILITY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS. AND WE THINK THAT. HELPING LOW AND MIDDLE INCOME PEOPLE AFFORD COVERAGE NOT ONLY HELP PEOPLE GET AND KEEP COVERAGE BUT ALSO MAINTAINS THE BILLION OR INDIVIDUAL MARKET WHICH IS. VERY IMPORTANT THIS YEAR I'M CONSIDERING ALL THE FEDERAL ACTIONS THAT HAVE YOU CREATED. ELEVEN CERTAINTY AND INDIVIDUAL MARKETS AND FINALLY WE ALSO SUPPORT FUNDING FOR ALL PROCLAIMS DATABASE WHICH IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE SUPPORTED. PNEUMOTHORAX LATER ON THIS ISSUE AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE LEGISLATURE'S ACTION PROPOSED TO FUND THE EFFORTS. SO WE.

TO ASK THE COMMITTEE TO INCLUDE AN ONGOING ALLOCATION OF FOUR POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. AND FUTURE YEARS TO FIND CALIFORNIA'S ELEVEN SUICIDE PREVENTION. LIFELINES. THIS IS NEEDED. TO HELP COVER THE RAPID INCREASE IN CALLS THAT THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE IS EXPERIENCING. THERE ARE MORE CALIFORNIA OWNS AND SUICIDAL DISTRESS THAN EVER INC. TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN ALONE CALIFORNIA LIFELINE MEMBERS ANSWERED OVER A HUNDRED AND FIFTY FIVE THOUSAND CALLS. CALLS THAT. REPRESENT PEOPLE REPRESENT PEOPLE IN SUICIDAL DISTRESS AND PEOPLE WHO ARE CONCERNED ABOUT LOVED ONES WHO ARE IN SUICIDAL DISTRESS. JUST THE OTHER DAY WE RECEIVED A CALL FROM A GROUP OF FOURTEEN YEAR OLDS WHO WERE ON A SOCCER TEAM AND THEY WERE WORRIED ABOUT THEIR FOURTEEN YEAR OLD FRIEND. THEY KNEW SHE HAD NOT BEEN TALKING YOUR PARENTS OR TEACHERS AND SHE WAS TALKING ABOUT SUICIDE IN THE COLD TO HELP HER. WE NO THAT THE INCREASING CALLS IS NOT SURPRISING. BASED ON WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CALIFORNIA SOME OF WHICH WE JUST HEARD ABOUT. SUICIDE THE SUICIDE RATE IS THE HIGHEST IT'S BEEN IN OVER THIRTY YEARS. AND FOR TEENS AND YOUNG ADULTS SUICIDE IS THE SECOND LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH. AND TEENS HAVE THE HIGHEST SUICIDE ATTEMPT RATE. WHICH WE KNOW THAT EVERY ATTEMPT INCREASES WOULD A DEATH BY SUICIDE. AND MEN CAUCASIAN MEN IN PARTICULAR BETWEEN FORTY FIVE AND FIFTY FOUR ARE A HIGH RISK GROUP. ARE CALLS ON THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE HAVE QUADRUPLED IN THE LAST TEN YEARS. AND THE LAST TWO YEARS ALONE THEY'VE INCREASED BY FIFTY PERCENT. THERE ARE MORE CALIFORNIA'S IN NEED. THEN WE CAN MEET THE DEMAND AT TIMES AND WE NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. USE THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE IN CALIFORNIA. IN CALIFORNIA ALONG WITH THE REST OF THE NATION COUNTS ON THE LIFELINE TO BE THE SAFETY NET. FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SUICIDAL DISTRESS. THE NATIONAL SUICIDE PREVENTION LIFELINE WAS LAUNCHED IN TWO THOUSAND FIVE IT'S MADE UP OF OVER A HUNDRED SIXTY FIVE. CRISIS CENTERS CURRENTLY. ACROSS THE UNITED STATES THEY'D HERE TO BEST PRACTICES THEY ARE CREDITED. AND THEY RECEIVE. VERY LITTLE SUPPORT. FROM THE LIFELINE. EACH CENTER RECEIVES ROUGHLY ABOUT FIFTEEN HUNDRED DOLLARS A YEAR. SUPPORT THEIR OPERATIONS. SO WE. NO THE CALIFORNIA IS LUCKY IN THE SENSE THAT. THE LARGEST. LIFELINE CENTER IN CALIFORNIA WE ARE ONE OF TWO SPANISH SPEAKING CRISIS CENTERS ACROSS THE NATION. OR ONE OF THREE. DISASTER DISTRESS HELPLINES ACROSS THE NATION WE HAVE. THE PASSION AND THE DEDICATION TO SERVE ALL OF THOSE IN NEED BUT WE. NEED MORE HELP TO MEET THE DEMAND. KIDO WILL DR KING A CAREER PRESIDENCY. DE HIRSCH MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES WILL CONTINUE TO TALK A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT THE NEED. THANK YOU FOR HAVING US HERE. WHAT IS A SUICIDE CRISIS LINE? BUT PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE. I WISH THAT KIND OF PREVENTIVE HEALTH CARE. HAD BEEN THERE WHEN I WAS FOURTEEN AND I ATTEMPTED SUICIDE. AND MY MOTHER SAID. YOU'RE JUST ASKING FOR ATTENTION. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT SHE WAS ASHAMED. BUT I BECAME ASHAMED TO AND I DID NOT FIND HELP. FOR OVER A DECADE AFTER THAT. CALIFORNIA HAS INVESTED MILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN ADVERTISING THE CRISIS LINE. THE COUNTIES. HAVE IT INVESTED IT WITH VIDEOS FOR SCHOOLS AND BILLBOARDS AND. COUNTLESS OTHER TYPES OF ADVERTISING. THE. STATE HOUSING PENDING BILL WHAT'S ACTUALLY IN THE LEGISLATURE TO THE ASSEMBLY THAT WOULD ADVERTISE A CRISIS LINE. ON STUDENT ID CARDS. THE NATION ADVERTISES THE CRISIS LINE. IF YOU GOOGLE SOMETHING THAT SEEMS TO INDICATE SUICIDE IF YOU PUT SOMETHING ON FACEBOOK THAT SEEMS TO INDICATE SUICIDE. IF YOU ASK SERIES SOMETHING THAT'S. RELATED TO SUICIDE. THEY ALL GIVE YOU. THE CRISIS LINE ONE EIGHT HUNDRED TWO SEVEN THREE. EIGHT TWO FIVE FIVE. THAT'S ALSO THE TITLE OF A VERY VERY SUCCESSFUL SONG. IT WAS WRITTEN BY AND SUNG BY A MUSICIAN CALLED LOGIC HIS. FANS IT SAID THAT. HE DONE SO MUCH TO SAVE THEIR LIVES ANY THOUGHT BUT I HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED. HELP WHAT CAN I DO THAT WILL REALLY MAKE AN IMPACT. HE PERFORMED ON MTV AT THE VIDEO MUSIC AWARDS. THE BEEN TWENTY TWO MILLION VIEWS OF IT. SO THE NUMBER IS OUT THERE AND PEOPLE CALL IT PEOPLE WHAT HELP THEY WANT TO KNOW HOW TO HELP PEOPLE THAT THEY LOVE. BUT WE HAVE NOT MADE THE SAME INVESTMENT. IN THE CRISIS LINE THAT WERE ADVERTISING WE HAVE NOT MADE THE SAME INVESTED INVESTMENT IN THE NINE ONE ONE OF SUICIDE PREVENTION. THERE ARE HOLES THAT ARE GOING TO DEVELOP IN OUR SAFETY NET IF WE DON'T SUPPORT. THIS INCREDIBLE NETWORK. OF NATIONAL LIFE MY MEMBERS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. AND. OUR NEED YOU KNOW IS. SEATING IN OUR CAPACITY. WE NEED SUPPORT AND IT'S VERY DIFFICULT WHEN SUPPORT IS YEAR TO YEAR CAN YOU IMAGINE HAVING HEALTH INSURANCE THAT YOU HAVE TO RENEW INCOME AND. LIKE ASK SOMEBODY EVERY YEAR PLEASE WOULD YOU. SUPPORT THIS AGAIN BUT I HAVE INSURANCE AGAIN. AND ALSO THE BUDGET WILL DO THINGS TO MAKE HER SAFETY NET STRONGER NOT ONLY WILL WE INCREASE COUNSELORS WHO ANSWER THE CALLS. THAT ARE SO IMPORTANT. WE WILL BE ABLE TO BUY TOOLS LIKE SOFTWARE THAT ENABLE US TO TRACK AND DO A BETTER JOB OF THE IN HELPING THE INDIVIDUAL AND CREATING A BETTER SYSTEM. WE'LL BE ABLE TO HIRE DATA ANALYSTS THAT WILL BE SHARED AMONG ALL THE LINES. WE WERE ABLE TO DO RURAL OUTREACH THAT IS IN THE CONTRACT THAT WE HAVE SUBMITTED. SO THAT CUT CONTRACT RIGHT NOW IS ON THE DESK OF THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SO WHY ARE WE ASKING THAT. THIS FUNDING IF YOU SHOULD CONTINUE IT. BEAT. TRANSFERRED TO THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES OVERSEE OUT SITE AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSION ONE THE LEGISLATURE. DIRECTED THEM TO DRAFT THE STATE SUICIDE PREVENTION PLAN. AND THE LEGISLATURE HAS GIVEN THEM THE RESPONSIBILITY OF OVERSIGHT AND OVERSEEN OTHER STATEWIDE. PROJECTS. LIKE THE. ADVOCACY AND SOMETHING THAT I'M FORGETTING DON'T TREAT HUSH. SO. ALSO IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERSIGHT AND ACCOUNTABILITY COMMISSIONS AUTHORITY AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES HAS NOT YET IN THE THREE YEARS WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON THIS. BEEN ABLE TO FINALIZE A CONTRACT WITH US. A MENTAL HEALTH HEALTH SYSTEM. WHERE YOU GET? YOUR COVERAGE YEAR TO YEAR IS NOT A GOOD SYSTEM. AND EVERY CALL WE TAKE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE A LIFE SO WE. APPRECIATE THAT ALL THAT YOU HAVE DONE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS AND WE HOPE WE CAN COUNT ON YOU TO BE CONTINUE TO BE ADVOCATES FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION. THANK YOU MA'AM. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THREE. HI IDLY SANDWICK I WORK FOR WELL SPACE HEALTH AS A DIRECTOR. OF THIS IS THAT PREVENTION CRISIS LINE.

THIS PROCESS MEANS CALIFORNIANS IN CRISIS RECEIVING FISSION LOCALIZE CARE CONSISTENT WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS FOR SUICIDE INTERVENTION. OUR CALL CENTERS PRIORITIZE DE ESCALATION OF CRISIS. THE LEAST INVASIVE CARE THAT'S VIABLE. AND THE COLORS ABILITY TO STAY SAFE FOR NOW AND IN THE NEAR FUTURE. AS A RESULT THESE CENTERS REDUCE PRESSURE CUFF PRESSURE AND COSTS FOR LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT EMS. HOSPITALS IN EMERGENCY CLINICS. IN FACT RECENT STUDIES FROM RAND INCLUDE INDICATE THE USE CALIFORNIA CALL CENTERS DO A BETTER JOB THAN NON LIFE PLAYING CALL CENTERS. IN ASSESSING PURSUES I'D RISK AND REDUCING DISTRESS IN COLORS. INVESTMENT IN THESE ELEVEN CRISIS CENTERS IS A FORCE MULTIPLIER INVESTMENT. IN THE WELL BEING OF YOUR ENTIRE STATE. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN LIFELINE CALIFORNIA CENTERS ANSWERED MORE CALLS THAN ANY OTHER STATE. IN THE NATIONAL NETWORK AN IMPRESSIVE ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY SEVEN THOUSAND THREE HUNDRED AND FIFTY FOUR CALLS. EACH ONE OF THESE CALLS REPRESENTS A DEEP PERSONAL. DESPERATE AND LIFE CHANGING MOMENT.

I REQUEST THIS COMMITTEE ADOPT THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD DIRECT TWENTY TWO MILLION AND ONE TIME EMERGENCY FUNDING TO THE TULARE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. THE TULARE LOCAL HOSPITAL DISTRICT OPERATES. THE TULARE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER LOCATED WITHIN THE CITY OF TULARE CALIFORNIA. IN ONE OF THE POOREST COUNTIES. IN OUR STATE. THERE ARE CURRENTLY OVER SEVENTY THOUSAND PEOPLE. AND IT SERVICE AREA WITH NO ACCESS. TWO LOCAL HOSPITAL SERVICES. AXES ACTIONS CONDUCTED BY PREVIOUS BOARDS ULTIMATELY LED TO ITS REMOVAL. AND THE EVENTUAL CLOSURE OF THE HOSPITAL ITSELF. SINCE THEN. A NEW BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS TAKEN OVER MANAGEMENT OF THE HOSPITAL. SEEKS TO RE OPEN THE DOORS SERVICE THE PEOPLE OF TULARE. WHILE AUDITS ARE CURRENTLY BEING CONDUCTED BY BOTH THE STATE AUDITOR AND THE TULARE COUNTY. DA'S OFFICE. ON POSSIBLE WRONGDOINGS THAT LED TO THE HOSPITAL'S CLOSURE. THE CURRENT BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS TAKEN. ON THE OUR DOORS TASK OF SETTLING PAST DEBTS. PRESERVING THE HOSPITAL ITSELF. THIS NEW BOARD IT'S TAKEN. IT'S NEW BOARD HAS WORKED DILIGENTLY. TO ADDRESS THE MISMANAGEMENT OF FUNDS BY PREVIOUS BOARDS. AND HAS WORKED TO RE OPEN THE DOORS TO THE MEDICAL CENTER. DESPITE BEST EFFORTS. THE BOARD HAS ENTERED CHAPTER NINE BANKRUPTCY AND NEED YOUR HELP. THE PRESSURE TO REOPEN THE MEDICAL CENTER IS MOUNTING AT A RAPID PACE BECAUSE THE EXTREME HEALTH CARE NEEDS. HE SAID UPON THE COMMUNITY. TULARE RESIDENTS ARE SUFFERING GREATLY WITHOUT ACCESS TO HEALTH CARE. TO RESIDENTS OF ALREADY DIED IN THE STREETS YOU TO LACK OF ACCESS. NEARBY EMERGENCY ROOMS HAVE WAIT LISTS THAT GO DAIS. PEOPLE SITTING OUT INSIDE TENTS. SAYS NOT ACCEPTABLE. IN THE FIFTH LARGEST ECONOMY. THE COUNTRY. WELL THE USE OF PREVIOUS FUNDS ARE DELIBERATED AND INVESTIGATED I MUST TAKE A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO REOPEN THE MEDICAL CENTER. AND ENSURE THAT IT CONTINUES PROVIDING VITAL HEALTH. CARE SERVICES. AS SUCH I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THIS COMMITTEE ADOPT MY PROPOSAL TO DIRECT TWENTY TWO MILLION AND ONE TIME FUNDING. THE TULARE REGIONAL MEDICAL CENTER. I RECOGNIZE THE NEED FOR ADDITIONAL TRANSPARENT SEE. SHOULD THESE FUNDS BE APPROVED. I AM OPEN AND WILLING TO WORK OUT ANY CONCERNS. OF THE COMMITTEE AND RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO ANSWER. MECHANISMS WHICH REQUIRE THE BOARD. TO ACCOUNT FOR HOW THESE FUNDS WILL BE SPENT. I LOOK FORWARD TO THE CONTINUING. THIS CONVERSATION AND RESPECTFULLY REQUEST SUPPORT. FOR THIS VITAL PER FALL. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE BOARD MEMBER EXECUTOR AFTER. MR HAVEL. HELLO MY NAME IS XAVIER AVALON A TERRY FARMER. FROM TULARE I DON'T LET NO LET'S ABOUT HEALTH CARE I'M LEARNING A LOT. I GOT INVOLVED WITH THE CITIZENS GROUP A FEW YEARS AGO WE SAW A LOT OF CORRUPTION WITH OUR. LOCAL BOARD. AND A LOT OF BAD THINGS DEALS HAPPENING BAD MANAGEMENT. SO WE DECIDED TO RISE UP ABOUT FORTY OR FIFTY OF US WARMER CITIZENS FOR HOSPITAL ACCOUNTABILITY. AND WE HELD A FEW ELECTIONS WHEN WE TOOK OVER THE BOARD. SINCE THEN ALL BILLBOARD IS NO LONGER THERE. FIVE NEW BOARD MEMBERS ALL LINED ON ALL COMMITTED. TULARE IS A BIG PLACE. AS A. SIMILAR MEN SAID IT IS ONE OF THE LOOK POOREST COUNTIES IN THE STATE IF NOT THE UNITED STATES LOW INCOME FARMWORKERS DISADVANTAGED PEOPLE. AND. BUT WE ARE NOT A LITTLE HOSPITAL IN A LITTLE NICHE OF THE VALLEY THAT CAN'T SUPPORT. IT'S POPULATION. WE ARE AT A THRIVING COMMUNITY WITHOUT A HOSPITAL AND WE CAN'T THRIVE IF WE DON'T HAVE A HOSPITAL WE NEED A JUMP START. WE NEED A WAY TO GET GOING TO ONCE WE'RE GOING ONE WILL. DO VERY WELL. AND WE WERE VERY SURE THAT. BUT I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO HELP US REDUCE UNNECESSARY SUFFERING. ANYBODY CAN GO TO THE COOLEY ADULT THE HOSPITAL IN BY CELLULAR AND SEE THE TWO TENTS THAT ARE PITCHED AND SEE. SO MANY PEOPLE AND I RECOGNIZE THOSE PEOPLE AND THEY'RE HURTING THEIR SICK THEY'RE IN PAIN THEY HAD BEAVERS THEY HAVE INJURIES. AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHEN THEY'RE GONNA BE SAW. BY A DOCTOR. AND AIDS HORRIFYING TO SEE THAT. AND. YOU KNOW WE CAN PUT BLAME ON A HAVE WHOEVER WE WANT TO PUT BLAME ON BUT IT'S NOT THESE PEOPLE'S FALL THEY TRUSTED SOMEBODY ELSE. AND NOW THEY'RE THE ONES SUFFERING. A LOT OF THE PEOPLE THAT CAN AFFORD TO GO OUTSIDE THE AREA DO. BUT BE AND THAT TULARE COUNTY IS ONE OF THE POOREST MOST DON'T SO THEY'RE STUCK WITH TWELVE FIFTEEN TWENTY HOUR WAITS. AND. IT'S IT'S IT'S VERY SAD AND UPSETTING TO SEE THAT. AND SO TULARE OUR TOWN IS DEDICATED TO GET IN THIS HOSPITAL OPEN. BUT WE WE HAVE THE GAP THAT WE NEED TO FILL THAT GAP WE'RE LOOKING TO YOU TO HELP FILL THAT. THANK YOU. HI MY NAME IS RICH IN ALOE A PARTNER WITH WITH LEE HFS CONSULTANTS. WE WERE BROUGHT IN. BACK IN OCTOBER. WHEN NOT. CURRENT BOARD WAS IN THE PROCESS OF FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY. A LOT WITH THE IDEA OF TRYING TO LOOK AT PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT FOR THE HOSPITAL IN WORKING WITH THE PER MANAGEMENT COMPANY. A UPON THE REJECTION WE'VE ACTUALLY BEEN THERE WORKING WITH THE CURRENT BOARD CANNOT WHOLE EFFORT TO TRY TO REOPEN THE HOSPITAL IN ADDITION. TO DOING DETAILED FINANCIAL PROJECTIONS ARE MONTH BY MONTH PROJECTIONS LOOKING AT THE CASH NEEDS. OF TO REOPEN THE HOSPITAL. I WANT TO STATE THAT ARE AND WE HAVE THOSE TO SHARE WITH YOU IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THOSE. AND GOING FOR IT. FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE WE'VE ALSO BEEN TRYING TO HELP THE PLOT LINE UP SOME INTRAPARTY ANSWERING. THAT MIGHT SERVE SOME OF THE. LITTLE BEAST INITIAL NEEDS TO KEEP THIS GOING IN AND START BACK. AS YOU KNOW THAT. IT TAKES. AND WHEN YOU'RE SPLIT THE CLOSED HOSPITAL IN TRYING TO REOPEN IT TAKES AWHILE TO GET IT GOING AND THEN. YOU KNOW BILLING AND IN COLLECTING THOSE THOSE FUNDS THE OTHER ISSUES THAT WE'VE RUN UP AGAINST IS THAT WE HAVE SEVERAL. AHA OF THE STATE SUPPLEMENTAL PROGRAMS TO FIND. BASICALLY EITHER IGT FUNDED PROGRAMS OR OTHER TYPES OF LIKE. PROGRAMS THAT ARE USED TOOK TO OFFSET SOME OF THE MEDIC HELP OUR SERVICES THAT THEY PROVIDE TO THE PATIENTS. THOSE SEEM TO BE HUNG UP RIGHT NOW. WITH THE STATE AGENCIES IN TRYING TO DETERMINE. IF WE ARE ELIGIBLE SINCE THE HOSPITAL'S CLOSE TO RECEIVE THOSE FUNDS EVEN THOUGH SOME OF THEM DATE BACK TO THE FOURTEEN FIFTEEN FISCAL YEARS WHEN SERVICES WERE BEING PROVIDED. AND THINGS LIKE THAT THIS IS KIND OF A UNIQUE SITUATION I BELIEVE WHERE THE HOSPITAL'S BEEN CLOSED. AND THINGS LIKE THAT. OF BACKDOOR PROJECTIONS THAT DETAIL PROJECTIONS THAT WE'VE DONE SHOW THAT WE NEED SOMEWHERE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. TO REOPEN WE BELIEVE SOME OF THAT MAY BE ABLE TO BE FUNDED THROUGH. AFFILIATION WITH SOME OF THE A LARGE HEALTH SYSTEM IN THE FRESNO AREA THAT IS VERY INTERESTED IN A LONG TERM ARRANGEMENT. WITH THE DISTRICT OPERA OPERATIONS THE PROBLEM WITH THAT IS THAT IT'S HUNG UP RIGHT NOW. IN THE BANKRUPTCY WHERE THE PRIOR MANAGEMENT COMPANY HAS PLACED A LIEN ON SOME OF THE ASSETS THAT WE MIGHT BE ABLE TO USE AS COLLATERAL FOR THAT LOAN. AND. WE BELIEVE THAT LEAN RELEASED OUR ATTORNEYS BELIEVE THAT THAT LEAN IS NOT VALID BUT IT WILL TAKE QUITE AWHILE. TO WORK THAT THROUGH THE COURTS. IN EFFORT TO GET TO BE ABLE TO ACCESS SOME OF THOSE FUNDS. IN DOING THAT. OF THE. THEY HOW THE OTHER ISSUE IS WE ALSO AT FROM A FINANCING PERSPECTIVE. HAS SPENT A LOT OF TIME TALKING TO SEVERAL LENDERS. A LOOKING AT BOTH ACCOUNT FUTURE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE FINANCING OTHER TYPES OF. IT DI THIRD POSSESSION FINANCING AND THINGS LIKE THAT. OUT LOOKING FOR IT THAT HAS NOT. HA DOT NEXT NOT AT LEAST SUCCESSFUL BID AT THIS TIME AND PRIMARILY I BELIEVE BECAUSE OF THE BANKRUPTCY AND SOME THE TERMS. LET ARE TIED WITH THAT I BELIEVE IN THE FUTURE SOME OF THOSE LENDERS WILL DEFINITELY LOOK. AT THE FUTURE. A AND FUNDING THAT'S. ARE THE OTHER THE OTHER ISSUE TO BRING UP IS THAT YOU KNOW THE CURRENT FUNDING THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR RIGHT NOW IS NOT. BE USED IN ANY WAY TOWARDS. PRIOR TO BANKRUPTCY ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IT'S REALLY JUST TO GET THE HOSPITAL UP AND RUNNING AND BRING IT BACK. OF FROM THAT PERSPECTIVE I BELIEVE ALL THE. THE OF PRE BANKRUPTCY PAYABLES WILL BE TO ADDRESS THROUGH THE COURT FUNCTION AT SOME POINT. LATER DOWN THE ROAD SO HOME HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS ANY OF YOU MAY HAVE. AND ALSO. PASS OUT THOSE LINES THOSE PROJECTIONS TO YOU FOR YOUR REVIEW THINK YOU. I WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOR. OR. HONOR AND I ALSO SERVED ON THE HOSPITAL BOARD OF IN THE YEAR TWO THOUSAND TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT FOR EIGHT YEARS. IN OCTOBER OFTWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN T. ARM SEE SERVICES WERE VOLUNTARILY SUSPENDED THE PUBLIC HOSPITAL DISTRICT BOARD HAD NO OTHER CHOICE IT WAS EITHER THAT OR A PERMANENT CLOSURE. THIS EVENT MARKED ACCUMULATION OF SERIES OF EVENTS LEADING TO THE CURRENT CRISIS IN RECENT YEARS THINGS HAVE GONE FROM BAD TO WORSE CITY ARE MC. DOCTOR PART MODE KUMAR SURFER TWENTY TWO YEARS ON THE HOSPITAL BOARD AND MANIPULATED THAT POSITION FOR PERSONAL POWER AND MONETARY GAIN. IN TWO THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN HD CA INDUCTOR BENNY BEEN CB WERE CONTRACTED TO MANAGE THE HOSPITAL AFTER ENGAGING IN NEGOTIATIONS WITH DR KUMAR. NEITHER DOCTOR BEEN CV NOR H. CCA HAD ANY PRIOR EXPERIENCE MANAGING HEALTH CARE FACILITIES OF ANY SIZE LET ALONE HOSPITAL. EIGHT CCA WAS FORMS THE COMPANY AFTER BEING SELECTED TO MANAGING CAME ON SCENE AFTER THE REQUEST OF FOR PROPOSAL PROCESS BIDS HAD ALREADY BEEN CLOSED. DR KUMAR NOT ONLY GAIN THE FAVOR FROM AND OTHER BOARD MEMBERS TO ACCOMPLISH THIS HE MADE SURE THAT ALL LECTIN OFFICIALS VIS VSI. SIZEABLE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS DID NOT PURSUE ANY INVESTIGATION INTO SUSPICIOUS ACTIVITY AT TRNC WHILE IT'S TRUE THAT PROBLEMS ATTY ARE MC HAD BEEN BREWING FOR SOMETIME. THE ROOT OF THESE PROBLEMS LEAD CONSISTENTLY BACK TO DR KUMAR. BEGINNING IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN PROBLEMS ESCALATED DURING H. CCA'S TENURE THE MANAGEMENT SERVICES AGREEMENT BETWEEN HDCAM HOSPITAL DISTRICT WAS ARGUABLY THE MOST ONE SIDED CONTRACT. BENEFITING THEM THAT HAD EVER BEEN EXECUTED FINANCIALS WERE PURPOSELY MISLEADING FABRICATED OR WITHHELD FROM THE HOSPITAL BOARD. H. CCA'S PRIVATE ATTORNEY SERVE TIES SIMULTANEOUSLY AS A DISTRICTS PRIMERICA COUNCIL AND REGULARLY DENIED RECRUITS ALL IN OBVIOUS CASES OF CONFLICT OF INTEREST. THE DULY ELECTED INDEPENDENT HUNDRED AND THIRTY EIGHT MEMBER MEDICAL EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE WAS SOME MALARIA LEE FIRED DUE TO DOCTOR KUMAR'S NEED FOR ULTIMATE POWER. AND THEN IT WAS REPLACED BY A SEVEN MEMBER SELF SELECTED PHYSICIAN FRIENDS WHICH INCLUDED HIMSELF. AND FIRST AND FOREMOST BECAUSE OF AGE CCA'S GREED AND LACK OF CAPITAL FUNDING THE HOSPITAL SERVICES AND CONSEQUENTLY THE CARROT THE HOSPITAL DECLINED. AND BECAME VERY DANGEROUS OUR RESIDENTS HAVE BECOME MARTYRS WHO HAVE DIED NEEDLESSLY OR WERE SEVERELY MAIMED REQUIRED RECONSTRUCTIVE SURGERY AND DECREASED QUALITY OF LIFE. THIS LED TO THE FORMATION OF OUR CITIZENS FOR HOSPITAL ACCOUNTABILITY GROUP OUT OF CONCERN OF ALL OF THESE ISSUES. LITTLE DID WE KNOW THE EXTENT OF THE CORRUPTION OUR GROUP HAS ACCOMPLISHED QUITE A BIT IN TWO AND A HALF YEARS WE HAD A STEP BY STEP PLAN WHICH ENCOMPASSED. DEFEATING A PROPOSED FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ADDITIONAL BOND BY A TWO TO ONE MARGIN. WE SUCCESSFULLY ELECTED TO BOARD MEMBERS COMMITTED TO ROOTING OUT THE CORRUPTION WITH THEY WERE ELECTED WITH OVER SIXTY PERCENT OF THE VOTES CAST WE RECALL DOCTOR KUMAR FROM THE BOARD WITH OVER AN EIGHTY PERCENT VOTE. WE ELECTED SYNOVIUM GET TERRACE WITH SEVENTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE VOTE TO REPLACE DR KUMAR HOWEVER SHE WAS DENIED HER RIGHTFUL PLACE ON THE AND IS ON THE BOARD AS AN ELECTED MEMBER FOR TWO MONTHS. BY THE LEGAL COUNSEL IN AUGUST OF TWO THOUSAND AND SEVENTEEN A SMALL GROUP OF US ASKED FOR AND RECEIVED AN AUDIENCE WITH THE TULARE COUNTY DISTRICT ATTORNEY. WE EXPOSE POTENTIAL CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BY H. CCA THREE MISSION NEW USE OF OUR DISTRICTS FUNDS AT ANOTHER DISTRICT HOSPITAL SOUTHERN INYO HOSPITAL WHICH ALSO WAS MANAGED BY EACH THE CA. THIS MEETING WAS THE BEGINNING OF AN INVESTIGATION THAT THE DISTRICT HAS DIRT TOURNEY HAS DETERMINED TO BE THE SINGLE LARGEST INVESTIGATION IN THE HISTORY OF TULARE COUNTY. THIS INVESTIGATION RESULTED IN A RAID ON DOCTOR BEEN SEABEES RESIDENTS AND NOW IS GOING ACROSS STATE LINES AND INTERNATIONALLY. OUR OLD SUMMIT GOAL HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO HAVE A STRONG AND VITAL COMMUNITY HOSPITAL WE HAVE NEARLY ACHIEVED OUR GOAL COMMUNITY MEDICAL CENTER IS BASED IN FRESNO HAS COMMITTED TO ASSISTING OUR HOSPITAL THROUGH MANAGEMENT OF THE FACILITY. THEY WILL INVEST IN OUR HOSPITAL ONCE WE CAN OBTAIN ADEQUATE FUNDING TO REOPEN IT HAS BEEN ESTIMATED TO COST FIFTEEN TO TWENTY MILLION TO RE OPEN AND BEING UNDER CAPITALIZE IS EXTREMELY ILL ADVISED. THIS DIFFICULT STEP TO ATTAIN FINANCING IS THE LAST REMAINING ROADBLOCK TO RE OPENING EIGHT CCA HAS BLED OUR RESERVES BLATTER ASSETS AND AND LET OUR COMMUNITY DRY. OUR RESIDENTS ARE VICTIMS AND CAUGHT IN THE CROSS HAIRS OF A DEVASTATING SITUATION THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN. OUR DISTRICT TAXPAYERS HAVE SUPPORTED THE HOSPITAL. ART BUT ASSUME WHO SUPPORT HOSPITAL ARE WITHOUT WHEN OUR RESIDENTS ARE WITHOUT VITAL EMERGENCY CARE WHILE SOME RESIDENTS LIVE IN REMOTE AND RURAL AREAS TRAVELING MORE THAN THIRTY MINUTES TO RECEIVE EMERGENCY CARE. THERE WILL BE MORE EMERGENCIES BECAUSE WITH THE HOSPITAL'S CLOSURE DISTRICT RUN RURAL CLINICS ARE ALSO CLOSE TO RETURN ROUTINE CARE CREATING ESPECIALLY DIRE SITUATION FOR THE ELDERLY AND CHILDREN WITHOUT TRANSPORTATION. THIS HOUSE TO SEIZE WE NEED OUR HOSPITAL FOR SEVENTY THOUSAND RESIDENTS TO FEEL SECURE IN THEIR HEALTHCARE. OUR COMMUNITIES IN A HEALTHCARE CRISIS AND WERE IN CRITICAL NEED OF YOUR SUPPORT. WE'RE GRATEFUL TO ASSEMBLYMAN MATHIS FOR PUTTING FORTH ITS PROPOSAL TO YOU TODAY AND WE THANK YOU FOR HEARING US AND FOR YOUR FUTURE SUPPORT.

SEEING NONE I DO HAVE A QUESTION THERE WAS A REFERENCE ABOUT A BOND BEING REJECTED I WAS. HOPING YOU COULD TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT IN IT. WHAT THAT? SPOKE ABOUT FOR THE LOCAL COMMUNITY AND SUPPORT. YET SO. NUMBER YEARS AGO THERE IS A THE SEISMIC REGULATIONS WE NEED TO THE. YOU KNOW CORRECT THAT. THE BOND WE HAD EIGHTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BOND AND THAT'S WHAT THE STATE ASSEMBLIES. IS I'D INVESTIGATING HOW THAT BOND WITH SPENT. BY THE SAME PEOPLE THAT YOU'VE HEARD THESE WITNESSES TALK ABOUT. THEY RAN SHORT. AND THEN THE SAME PEOPLE. DR KUMAR AND BENNY BEEN ZIEVE OPPOSE THE FIFTY FIVE MILLION DOLLAR BOND. AND REALLY. THEY SAID IF WE DON'T HAVE THAT WHEN YOU FINISHED THE. THE THE THE EXPANSION BECAUSE IT WAS WAS RAN SHORT OF MONEY. BUT REALLY WHAT WE THINK WAS DONE WITHOUT LOOKING AT THE FINANCES AND RICH CAN SPEAK TO THIS WAS IT WAS REALLY JUST TO COVER. THE LOSSES AND PROBABLY SO SHUFFLE MORE MONEY INTO THEIR POCKETS. AND SO ALREADY SEEING THEIR THEIR GAME PLAN THAT'S WHY THE CITIZEN GROUP BUT WE WE FORMED TO DEFEAT THAT BOND BECAUSE WE KNEW IF IT PASSED. BUT THAT HOSPITAL ALL THE MONEY WOULD GO DOWN THE DRAIN AND WE'D END UP WITH A BIGGER HOLE. AND PROBABLY NEVER HOPE IN THE HOSPITAL AGAIN SO WE SAW IT AS WE NEED TO KEEP THE BOND. AND MATTER OF FACT WE HAD A SLOGAN. THE VOTE NO ON MEASURE AYE AND SAVE OUR PUBLIC HOSPITAL ON AND THEY HAD VOTE YES. MY MEASURE AYE AND SAVE THE HOSPITAL. AND WE BELIEVE WE WERE RIGHT IN. SINCE IT'S THE BIGGEST INVESTIGATION INTO LARRY COUNTY HISTORY I THINK THAT PROVES OUR CITIZEN GROUP WAS RIGHT TO DEFEAT THAT BOND. IT INTO FURTHER ANSWER YOUR QUESTION I THAT BOND WAS PROPOSED TO FINISH AN EXPANSION. OF THAT THE PRIOR MANAGEMENT WAS PLANNING THEY ACTUALLY HAVE A TOWER THAT'S PARTLY CONSTRUCTED RIGHT NOW THAT WAS USED FOR INITIAL BOND ISSUE. THAT IS BY THE WAY BACK BY TAX REVENUES. COMING INTO SUPPORT THE DEBT SERVICE ON THAT EXISTING BOND ISSUE. THIS PROPOSAL ON THIS NEW BOND ISSUE WAS TO COMPLETE THAT TOWER. I ALSO WANT TO SAY THAT THE CURRENT HOSPITAL IS SEISMIC. LEE COMPLIANT THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE OF THEY HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH LARGE POD TO MAKE SURE THAT IT MEETS ALL THE STANDARDS. TO REOPEN THE HOSPITAL'S THAT'S NOT THE ISSUE IS REALLY FOR THIS. FINISH THIS ADDITION I THOUGHT THAT WAS BEING PLANNED. SEEING NO FURTHER QUESTIONS WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN. HE WOULD ELECT CLOSES MY MEMORY MATHIS YES I'D I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO CLOSE LATE AGAIN.

MR ALBULA SAID THIS IS THE JUMP START THIS COMMUNITY NEEDS. TWO. GET OFF A LIFE SUPPORT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FOR OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIVE. I GAVE. SWITCHING GEARS HERE. PLEASE GO AHEAD. CHAIRMAN HARPER. MEMBERS. GET AFTERNOON. I AM PLEASED TO PRESENT A REQUEST BEFORE YOU WHICH WOULD FURTHER FAWN THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE PARTNERSHIP. THIS PROGRAM. WHICH IS RUN THROUGH THE TULARE. COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION WAS ESTABLISHED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. IT WAS CREATED AS A HIGH SCHOOL PROGRAM DESIGNED TO REDUCE UNDERAGE DRINKING AND DRIVING AND TO PROMOTE A TEENAGE LIFESTYLE FREE OF ALCOHOL AND OTHER DRUGS. IT IS THE MISSION OF FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE. TO BUILD POSITIVE AND HEALTHY YOUTH DEVELOPMENT. THAT ENGAGE OTHER YOUTH AS ACTIVELY HERS AND RESOURCES IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM GREW FROM A PILOT PROGRAM IN THREE COUNTIES TO A STATEWIDE MOVEMENT. THAT AT ITS PEAK. OPERATED IN FIFTY FIVE OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. AND HAD JUST OVER ONE THOUSAND CHAPTERS. AT SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITY SITES ACROSS THE STATE. HOWEVER SINCE THE DOWNTURN OF THE ECONOMY. THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM. THE STATE AND LOCAL LEVELS. HAVE SEEN DRAMATIC REDUCTIONS IN FUNDING RESULTING IN LESS CAPABILITY TO SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE. WHEN THEY NEED INTO NEWS TO GROW. TODAY THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM. A TEAM USED TO OPERATE IN FIFTY OF THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WITH JUST OVER FIVE HUNDRED CHAPTERS. ONE PROGRAM THAT WAS. DISSEMINATED. THE ELIMINATION OF FUNDING WAS THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE. MENTORING PROGRAM. THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE MENTORING PROGRAM. IS A CROSS SAGE MENTORING PROGRAM THAT CONNECTS HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS. POSITIVE ROLE MODELS FOR MIDDLE SCHOOL STUDENTS. REPAIR THEM FOR A SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION TO HIGH SCHOOL. WHY THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN ABLE TO RETAIN SOME OF ITS ORIGINAL SERVICES? THE BENEFITS OFFERED TO THE STUDENT SHOULD BE. SPAN DID. TO THEIR ORIGINAL LEVELS. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN PROVEN. HAVE A PROVEN TRACK RECORD. OF BENEFITING THEIR PARTICIPANTS ESPECIALLY WITH REGARDS TWO REDUCING ABUSE OF ALCOHOL TOBACCO DRUGS AND VIOLENCE. IT'S PROGRAM HELPS YOUNG PEOPLE STAY IN SCHOOL. INCREASING SCHOOLS. AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE AND HELPS PROMOTE A SAFE SCHOOL ENVIRONMENT. AS SUCH. WE SHOULD EXPAND THE CAPACITY OF FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE SYSTEM. IN THE FIFTY COUNTIES BY PROVIDING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES TO SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE QUALITY OF LOCAL PROGRAM IMPLEMENTATION. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THIS. I AM REQUESTING. SIX MILLION ANNUALLY WE TRANSFER FROM THE GENERAL FUND. DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR THE PURPOSES OF FUNDING THE CALIFORNIA FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE PARTNERSHIP. AT TULARE COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION. WITH ME TODAY I HAVE ONE GOOD ONE. FRIDAY NIGHT LIFE. AND STANDING AND TODAY FEELING GOOD ONE IS DR JIM FULLER. THEN MISTER RADU THAT THEIR WORRIES AT ALL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO BE HERE. TALKED ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS. WE HAVE HAD THE PLEASURE OF ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN MAKING THEIR COMMUNITIES BETTER PLACES TO LIVE SINCE NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. WITH THE RECESSION THAT WE HAD IT TEN YEARS AGO WE'VE SEEN A DRAMATIC DECREASE IN OUR CAPACITY OF OUR LOCAL COUNTIES. SERVE YOUNG PEOPLE. IT'S OUR HOPE AS MR MATHIS DESCRIBED THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REINVEST TO SEE MORE YOUNG PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN OUR PROGRAMS. AND JUST THE COUNTIES IN WHICH USE REPRESENTS WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY A HUNDRED AND NINETY CHAPTERS THOSE ARE IN YOUR COUNTIES NOT THAT'S WIENER DISTRICTS SO. OUR DATA SYSTEM ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH TO BREAK DOWN EXACTLY TO DISTRICT LINES. BUT WE KNOW IS THAT WHEN YOUNG PEOPLE ARE ENGAGED AND PARTICIPATING CIVIC KLAY POSITIVELY. THEY AVOID MANY OF THE PROBLEMS WHICH YOU'RE ADDRESSING ON THE OTHER TWENTY EIGHT ISSUES THAT BEFORE YOU TODAY. I APPLAUD YOUR STAMINA. AND YOUR ABILITY TO TAKE A LOOK AT A HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX MILLION DOLLARS A REQUEST BEFORE YOU TODAY. AND ALLOWING ALL WHO COME TO SPEAK THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO SO. WE HAVE SOME AMAZING YOUNG PEOPLE FROM SEVERAL OF OUR COUNTIES WHO WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS YOU TODAY. AND SOME HAVE MET WITH YOU OR YOUR LOCAL STAFF. THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM BEGAN BECAUSE IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR WE WERE LOSING A YOUNG PERSON TO DRINKING AND DRIVING. INCIDENTS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES. IN THE TIME SINCE THEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO REDUCE THAT DOWN TO ONE YOUNG PERSON EVERY FORTY FIVE MINUTES. SO IN THE TIME THAT THIS SESSION HAS BEEN GOING ON WE'VE HAD THREE YOUNG PEOPLE THAT HAVE BEEN INTO AN EMERGENCY ROOM. OR HAVE DIED BECAUSE OF THE COMBINATION OF ALCOHOL AND AUTOMOBILES. WE'RE PLEASED WITH THIS IS AN ISSUE THAT IS ONE HUNDRED PERCENT PREVENTABLE. AND THE ONLY WAY IT'S PREVENTABLE WE BELIEVE IS BY ENGAGING YOUNG PEOPLE IN FINDING SOLUTIONS. SO THE KEY TO THE FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE PROGRAM WE BELIEVE IS THAT WE DON'T DO FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE TO YOUNG PEOPLE OR FOR YOUNG PEOPLE. BUT WE DO FRIDAY NIGHT LIVE WITH THEM.

HI MY NAME IS KELLY MAC MILLAN AND EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FOR SUSAN G. KOMEN FOR ALL NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CALIFORNIA. AND PART OF OUR MISSION IS OBVIOUSLY TO FIND THE MOST CRITICAL NEED AND SAVE LIVES FROM BREAST CANCER AND FOR RESEARCH. AND ONE OF THE MAJOR COMPONENTS OF HOW WE SERVE OUR COMMUNITIES AND MEET THAT CRITICAL NEED IS THE BREAST AND CERVICAL TREAT TREATMENT CANCER PROGRAM. THROUGH THE EVERYONE COUNTS PROGRAM. WE DEPEND ON THAT PROGRAM TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO HARM THE WOMEN IN CALIFORNIA ALONE THAT THE TWENTY NINE THOUSAND WOMEN WILL BE DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER. AND TO BE TOLD YOU HAVE BREAST CANCER IS DEVASTATING ENOUGH BUT THEN TO BE TOLD THAT YOUR TREATMENTS GOING TO BE CUT OFF. IT EIGHTEEN MONTHS MAKES NO SENSE IT'S OVERWHELMING AND IT DOESN'T IT. IT IT'S JUST. IT'S REALLY DIFFICULT FOR PATIENTS THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS THAT CAN'T TRAVEL THAT HAVE LANGUAGE BARRIERS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO FINISH THEIR TREATMENT IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS OR TWO HUNDRED DIFFERENT TYPES OF BREAST CANCER.

MICHELLE GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA REPRESENTING THE LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND AGAIN FOR THE REASONS STATED BEFORE ALSO IN SUPPORT THE COMMAND. LUCY QUESTIONED ALARM BEHALF OF MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS IN VERY STRONG SUPPORT WE WORK A LOT WITH THIS PROGRAM AND IT'S JUST DEVASTATING TO THE WOMEN WE HELPED TO. NO THAT THERE'S NO THERE'S NO MORE COVERAGE. THE COMMAND. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIX ALL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. I'M I WILL COMMENT THAT I WAS PLEASED TO JOIN ASSEMBLY MEMBER LOW MOAN AND CERVANTES ON THEIR BILL WHICH MARRIES THIS PROPOSAL. AND HAVING A MOTHER WHO I WENT THROUGH BREAST CANCER TREATMENT HERSELF. I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS FOR MEMBERS OF OUR COMMUNITY TO KNOW THAT THERE ARE NO TREATMENT CAPS. WITH THAT WILL HOLD ISSUE SIX OPEN IN THE BOND ISSUE SEVEN. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING I'M OUT LUCY QUESTION ELLA I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF. MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS. ALONG WITH APPROXIMATELY FORTY FIVE OTHER COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS FROM EVERY PART OF THE STATE. BUT WE ARE RESPECTFULLY REQUESTING THAT CURRENT FUNDING. FOR CONSUMER HEALTH ASSISTANCE BE CONTINUED. THE FUNDING IS DUE TO EXPIRE JUNE THIRTIETH. AND OUR REQUEST MIRRORS THE WAY THIS PROGRAM HAS BEEN. A IMPLEMENTED IN THE PAST WHICH IS. TWO YEARS OF FUNDING OF FOR A TOTAL OF TWENTY SIX POINT FIVE MILLION GENERAL FUND SO ABOUT HALF OF THAT. A A YEAR OVER TWO YEARS. THIS TYPE OF ASSISTANCE IS NOW AVAILABLE THROUGH COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS AS I MENTIONED THROUGHOUT THE STATE'S OF BATS RURAL CALIFORNIA THAT'S URBAN CALIFORNIA. THAT'S THE COAST THAT'S INLAND BUT BIG COUNTIES THAT'S LITTLE COUNTIES NORTH AND SOUTH. COMMUNITIES DEPEND ON THESE HEALTHCARE ASSIST ERRORS NOT ONLY TO. COMPLETE THEIR APPLICATIONS FOR COVERAGE PROGRAM SUCCESSFULLY BUT ALSO TO HELP THEM WITH A VERY DIFFICULT PROCESS IN MANY SITUATIONS OF NAVIGATING THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM. I COULD NOT HAVE T. THIS UP BETTER MYSELF WOMEN WHOSE HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. IS ENDING WHAT DO YOU DO. PEOPLE WHO ARE IN SMALL RURAL COUNTIES WITH VERY NARROW NETWORKS OF PROVIDERS IN EITHER THEIR. MEDI CAL PLAN OR THEY'RE COVERED CALIFORNIA PLAN SOMETIMES EVEN PRIVATE INSURANCE. HOW DO YOU GET HELP FOR? SEEING A SPECIALIST FOR GETTING TRANSPORTATION FOR ACCESSING MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES. SO THIS REQUEST IS STATEWIDE. AND ITS FOUR OUT REGION ENROLLMENT BUT ALSO FOR RETAINING COVERAGE AND FOR HELPING PEOPLE ACTUALLY USE COVERAGE. OHM THE AMAZING AND HISTORIC PRESENTATION THAT OPENED TODAY'S HEARING. IS VERY MUCH APPRECIATED. AND WE KNOW HOWEVER THAT WITHOUT MAINTAINING THIS WORK FORCE OF COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS TO ACTUALLY REACH THE PEOPLE WHO WILL BE COVERED BY THE NEW PROGRAMS. THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH THAT CAN BE DONE IN OTHER WORDS THE COVERAGE. AND POTENTIAL ACCESS ISN'T REALLY MEANINGFUL TO AN INDIVIDUAL WHO DOESN'T KNOW ABOUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO ENROLL. WHO FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS MAY NOT BE ABLE TO USE THE SYSTEM ON THEIR OWN? LANGUAGE ACCESS BEING A SENIOR HAVING A MENTAL HEALTH ISSUE THERE ARE ALL KINDS OF REASONS WHY PEOPLE EXPERIENCE BARRIERS TO ENROLLMENT. AND ADDING TO THAT THE CURRENT CLIMATE OF FEAR WE HEARD A LOT ABOUT THAT EARLIER TODAY AMONGST IMMIGRANT COMMUNITIES. TO THE POINT WHERE WE'RE WORKING WITH FAMILIES WITH CITIZEN CHILDREN. WHO ARE ACTIVELY AVOIDING HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THEY ARE AFRAID? THAT A FAMILY MEMBER. WHO IS A CITIZEN? COULD BE SUBJECTED TO SOME KIND OF HARM. AND ALSO BECAUSE THEY FEAR THE DEPORTATION OF A PARENT OR SIBLING SO THESE COMMUNITY BASED ORGANIZATIONS WORK WITH COMMUNITIES TO GIVE THEM INFORMATION. TO TRY AND ADDRESS THEIR CONCERNS TO HELP THEM GET INTO PROGRAMS TO HELP THEM KEEP THAT COVERAGE INTO LARRY FOR EXAMPLE WHERE WE HEARD TODAY FIFTY SIX PERCENT OF. THE RESIDENTS OR ON THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM A BIG PART OF BEING ON THEIR PROGRAM INVOLVES. GOING THROUGH PERIODIC REVIEWS AND STATEWIDE IN TWENTY FIFTEEN ONLY. SIXTY FIVE PERCENT OF INDIVIDUALS MADE IT THROUGH THAT PROCESS WHEREAS WITH AND A SISTER. OF THE TYPE OF PROGRAM THAT I'M REFERRING TO OF WE HAVE RETENTION RATES IN THE EIGHTY TO NINETY PERCENT RANGE SO HEALTHCARE SYSTEMS DEPEND ON THIS. THE CONSUMERS DEPEND ON IT AND IT'S VERY EFFECTIVE ARM AND. RETENTION I SHOULD ALSO MENTION ARM IS CRITICAL BECAUSE IT PREVENTS CHURNING IN THE SYSTEM OF ELIGIBLE PEOPLE. A A A STUDY FROM QUITE A FEW YEARS AGO SO THE NUMBERS NOW WOULD BE MUCH HIGHER EVERY TIME WE LOSE SOMEONE TO A COVERAGE PROGRAM. IT COSTS IN THE IN THE CASE OF MEDI CAL IT COSTS ABOUT A HUNDRED EIGHTY. DOLLARS TO GET THAT PERSON BACK GOD SO THESE ARE ELIGIBLE INDIVIDUALS WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY MAINTAINING THE COVERAGE IN USING THE COVERAGE. WE RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT HOME FOR THIS REALLY CRITICAL PART OF OUR HEALTHCARE INFRASTRUCTURE REALLY WEEKEND. OF BUILD OUT YOU KNOW THE MEDICAL WORKFORCE WE CAN BUILD OUT THE HOSPITAL'S A WE CAN. INCREASE AND EXPAND THE TYPES OF INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE ELIGIBLE BUT IF WE DON'T GET THE MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED TO ACTUALLY KNOW ABOUT THE PROGRAMS AND ROLAND THEM. IF THERE COVERAGE AND BE ABLE TO USE A DOCTOR A WHEN THEY NEED IT THEN. OBVIOUSLY THAT IS COUNTER PRODUCTIVE AUM I WOULD JUST NOTE I I DID MENTION THAT NEARLY EVERY COUNTY IN THE STATE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE FOR THESE FUNDS. INTO LARRY AT RISK IS FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS IN ORANGE COUNTY AT RISK IS TWO MILLION DOLLARS. IN FRESNO IT'S ONE MILLION AND SO NO MY THREE HUNDRED SIX. THOUSAND DOLLARS SO THERE ARE BROAD IMPACTS HOME FOR THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THROUGHOUT. THANK YOU MA'AM. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVEN. HI UM MY NAME IS BOBBY CAPITAL I AM REPRESENTING COMMITTEE HEALTH COUNCILS A HEALTH POLICY AND ADVOCACY ORGANIZATION IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY.

CALLING THEIR CLIENTS AT EVERY HOUR OF THE WORK DAY AND EVEN AFTER THE WORK DAY AND TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CLIENTS ARE. FILLING OUT APPLICATIONS PROPERLY THEY HAVE ALL THE MATERIALS THAT THEY NEED TO FILL OUT THESE APPLICATIONS. AND THEN WHEN THERE ARE. ISSUES IN THE SYSTEM AND WITH THE APPLICATIONS THEMSELVES THEY ARE CALLING EVERYBODY THAT THEY KNOW. TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS ARE PROCESSED AND THAT THE COVERAGE IS BEING UTILIZED AFTER APPLICATIONS ARE ACCEPTED. I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER PRIORITIZING FUNDING TO SUSTAIN THESE COMPREHENSIVE SERVICES ESPECIALLY AS WE EXPLORE OPTIONS TO ACHIEVE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE. IN ADDITION TO INCREASING ACCESS TO COVERAGE WHICH IS GREAT AND VERY IMPORTANT WE NEED TO SIMULTANEOUSLY ENSURE THAT THERE'S ALWAYS SOMEONE ON THE OTHER AND. THAT CAN HELP OUR RESIDENTS NAVIGATE ARE COMPLEX HEALTHCARE SYSTEM THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM.

TO GO OVER ALL THESE TERMINOLOGY THAT YOU HAVE NEVER SEEN BEFORE AND YOU NEED TO SIGN OUT EVERY SINGLE PIECE OF DOCUMENT. THAT'S THE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE UNDER OUR OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS PACKAGES AND FORUMS THAT. INDIVIDUALS THAT HAD NEVER BEEN ON MEDI CAL OR COVER CAL FORGET NEED ASSISTANCE TO TO COMPLETE. WE WORK FROM DOWNTOWN SACRAMENTO WE HAD PEOPLE FROM THE CAPITAL AND OTHER ENTITIES VERY HIGHLY EDUCATED NEEDING ASSISTANCE TO COMPLETE THEIR APPLICATIONS FOR COVER CALIFORNIA AND OTHER PROGRAMS. IN HELPING NAVIGATE THAT THE HEALTH INSURANCE SYSTEM THAT WE HAVE. WHAT CAN I TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A VERY CLOSE TO MY HEART BECAUSE FAMILIES INDIVIDUALS ACROSS THE STATE NEED ASSISTANCE? AND WE'RE SORRY TO SEE THAT IT WAS NOT PART OF THE CAMP PACKAGE BUT WE'RE HAPPY TO TO CONNECT YOU WITH FAMILIES INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE PERSONALLY IMPACTED. BY. BY THE ASSISTANCE THAT THEY RECEIVE IN PERSON WE ALL LIKE TO RECEIVE THAT IN PERSON AT THE FENCE. INSTEAD OF GOING INTO A TECHNICAL YOU KNOW LIKE PROCESS AND ALL OF THAT THAT WE HAVE. BUT. WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT THAT BE ASSISTANCE FOR? FORGET NAVIGATING OUR OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM IS VERY MUCH NEEDED AND PEOPLE OF COURSE OUT OF LOW INCOME.

SHE HAS SLOWLY REGAINED STRENGTH. AND IT'S NICE TO SEE THAT SHE IS ABLE TO I'M CONTINUE TO LIVE INDEPENDENTLY. THE SECOND PURCHASE BUT I'D LIKE TO TELL YOU ABOUT IS HIS NAME IS LARRY HE IS. AND IS MID FIFTIES IS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN MALE. AND HE HAS HAD SEVEN STROKES HE'S CONFINED TO A WHEELCHAIR DUE TO DEGENERATIVE JOINT DISEASE. AND HAS HE'S DIAGNOSED WITH THEM SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER DIABETES AND HIS TWENTY YEAR OLD SON WHO LIVES WITH HIM. HIS SON GOES TO COLLEGE AND IS HIS FULL TIME CAREGIVER. THE HELP SAM WITH. SHOPPING DRESSING BATHING MEDICATION MANAGEMENT. BEFORE LARRY ATTENDED OUR PROGRAM HE WOULD CALL NINE ONE ONE FOR ANY MEDICAL NEED. AND ONCE HE GOT INVOLVED IN THE PROGRAM. OUR MEDICAL TEAM WAS ABLE TO CARE FOR HIM AND HELP HIM. SO HE HAS NOW EDUCATED AND REALIZE THAT HE CAN COME TO US WHEN THERE ARE MEDICAL NEEDS. AND NOW HE DOESN'T CALL NINE ONE ONE IT'S OFTEN HERE. UTILIZES THE TEAM THAT IS THERE TO SUPPORT HIM AND HE'S ABLE HE AND HIS SON ARE MORE EDUCATED. THIS IS JUST A SNAPSHOT OF TWO OF OUR MANY VULNERABLE PARTICIPANTS WITH COMPLEX CASES. AND THE NEED FOR ADULT DAY HEALTH TO STAY OUT OF HIRE. ON COST FACILITIES IS AVAILABLE THROUGH ADULT DAY HEALTH. BY TWENTY THIRTY. TWENTY FIVE PERCENT OF SAN FRANCISCO'S POPULATION ONE IN FOUR WILL BE SENIORS. AND THE FASTEST GROWING SEGMENT WILL BE OVER EIGHTY FIVE YEARS OLD. NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF OUR POPULATION ARE LOW INCOME MEDI CAL CLIENTS WITH NO OUT OF POCKET EXPENSES. A STUDY FROM THE TO THE TWENTY SIXTEEN GENWORTH FINANCIAL COST OF CARE SHOWS THAT ADULT DAY HEALTHCARE IS APPROXIMATELY ONE FIFTH. OF SKILLED NURSING COSTS. SAN FRANCISCO IS THE SECOND MOST EXPENSIVE CITY. IN THE UNITED STATES AND THERE ARE NOT ENOUGH SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. ADULT DAY HEALTH IS BEING STARVED. WE ARE REQUESTING A BUDGET ALLOCATION TO INCREASE ADULT DAY HEALTH. AND THE MEDI CAL FEE BY TWENTY PERCENT. THE VETERANS AFFAIR A VETERANS ADMINISTRATION IS PAYING FOR THE SAME SERVICE WITH THAT AMOUNT. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND WE'D LIKE TO WORK WITH STAFF AND OTHERS TO REFINE ESTIMATES. OF FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SAN FRANCISCO COUNTY. ADULT DAY HEALTH IS AN EFFECTIVE AND COST EFFICIENT AND IT'S AN EXTREMELY GOOD INVESTMENT. IT SIMPLY MAKES SENSE FOR THE TAXPAYERS FOR FRAIL THE FRAIL POPULATION AND FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. LET'S BE PRO ACTIVE LET'S HELP PEOPLE STAY IN THEIR HOMES LIVING COMMUNITY AND STAY OUT OF EXPENSIVE FACILITIES. THANK YOU. THANK YOU I AM KATHY DAVIS ON THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF BABY SENIOR SERVICES AND I'VE BEEN WITH OUR DON'T THEY HEALTH CENTER SINCE IT OPENED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR. IT KIND OF MAKES ME A DINOSAUR A BEEN THERE FORTY YEARS. BUT JUST SEEING THE ADULT THEY HEALTH CARE AND THE IMPACT THAT IT MAKES AND REALIZING THAT FOR THE LAST TWELVE YEARS THERE HASN'T BEEN AN INCREASE. IN OUR RATE HOWEVER WE'VE HAD TO DEAL WITH ALL THE INCREASES IN SAN FRANCISCO IT'S GETTING REALLY DIFFICULT TO KEEP OUR DOORS OPEN. AND IN SAN FRANCISCO YOU HAVE TO REALIZE WE JUST DON'T HAVE A LOT OF NURSING HOMES THEY'RE JUST NOT THERE EVEN IF YOU WANTED TO PAY FIVE TIMES MORE TO TAKE CARE OF THE POPULATION WITH SARAH. WE DON'T EVEN HAVE THAT. AVAILABLE SO PEOPLE HAVE TO GO OUT OF COUNTY OR DIE OF IF THEY DON'T GET THE KIND OF SERVICES THAT WE OFFER SO I JUST WANT TO URGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS REQUEST FOR SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE IT IS KIND OF UNIQUE. IT'S IMPORTANT FOR EVERY PART OF THE STATE BUT IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT SAN FRANCISCO BECAUSE WE REALLY ARE TRYING TO KEEP THE POPULATION. IN THE COMMUNITY THANK YOU THANK HIM. GOOD AFTERNOON OR GOOD EVENING I'M TRACY DOBRA NOVEL WITH JEWISH FAMILY AND CHILDREN'S SERVICES. WE OPERATE THE LEHIGH MIDDLE THEY CENTER IN SAN FRANCISCO AND I'M REPLY THE YOUNGEST ADULT THEY CENTER AT NINETEEN YEARS. OF OPERATION. WE SERVE OVER A HUNDRED AND TWENTY PEOPLE EVERYDAY AT OUR CENTER. AND REALLY WE ARE HERE TO SUPPORT AS YOU'VE HEARD MY COLLEAGUES OF THE NEED FOR A RATE INCREASE IN SAN FRANCISCO WERE OPERATING ON RATES THAT WERE SENT BACK IN TWO THOUSAND AND SEVEN. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED AN INCREASE THERE HAVE BEEN OTHER COUNTIES THAT HAVE GONE INCREASES THAT THERE IS A PRECEDENT. YOU KNOW THIS IS OUR MOST VULNERABLE POPULATION. IT IS A COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO KEEP PEOPLE AT HOME IN PART OF THE COMMUNITY. AND ALL SHARE JUST ONE OF OUR ONE OF OUR CLIENTS RECENTLY WAS ASKED WHY SHE DIDN'T ARE BY AN OUTSIDE FUNDER. AND SHE SAID BECAUSE IF SHE DIDN'T COME TO THE CENTER SHE WOULD SIT AT HOME ALL DAY LONG BY HERSELF. NO FAMILY SHE WOULD NOT BE GOING OUT SHOULD NOT BE GETTING MEDICAL CARE. AND MOST LIKELY SHE WOULD DIE IN THAT SITUATION AND SHE SAID THIS OF KNOWING HOW LUCKY SHE IS ABLE TO CONDUCT CENTER. AND SHE EVEN SAID THAT THE LIKE OF THE SENATE PASSED AWAY BECAUSE SHE HAD BEEN THERE SO LONG. SO WE REALLY SUPPORT THE NEED FOR THE FEE INCREASE IT'S BECOMING MORE AND MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO BE ABLE TO OPERATE HIGH QUALITY SERVICES AND PEOPLE KEEP THESE. MOST VULNERABLE. PEOPLE OF OUR POPULATION SAY THANK YOU YOU CAN. AND I'M ANY COME FROM SELF HELP FOR THE ELDERLY SIMILARLY SELF HELP OPEN DAHLE ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE CENTER BACK IN NINETEEN NINETY SIX SO DISHES LIKE OUT TWENTY THIRD YEAR IN OPERATION. AND FOR MANY YEARS OF SENIORS REALLY FIND IT. MOST COST EFFECTIVE AS WELL AS SERVING THE FAMILIES WITH A SIX HOUR SIX AND A HALF HOURS OF RESPITE. AT OUR CENTER AND AS MARTY SAID MANY OF OUR VERY FRAIL SENIORS TICKET LEASH EIGHT TO TEN SOMETIMES FOURTEEN MEDICATIONS. BUT BECAUSE THEY ARE KEPT AT THE CENTER AND THE FAMILIES COULD. GO OFF AND WORK A FEW HOURS AND THEN FEEL THAT YOU KNOW THE ELDERLY ARE WELL TAKEN CARE OFF AN ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE CENTER. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE RECENTLY WE HAVE ONE SENIOR THAT WAS HOSPITALIZED FOR TWO NIGHTS INTO. IN THE EMERGENCY HOSPITAL AND THEN CENTER INTENSIVE CARE FOR ONE NIGHT AND THE BILL CAME BACK AS THIRTY FOUR THOUSAND DOLLARS. AND AN ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE CENTER LIKE OURS RECEIVE ROUGHLY THE SAME AMOUNT SEVENTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR THIS IS FALL EACH TYPE OF THE TWO NIGHTS OF HOSPITAL STAY. BUT YET AN ADULT DAY HEALTH CARE CENTER RECEIVE ABOUT EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLAR A YEAR FALL TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY DAYS OF CARE AT ONE OF OUR CENTERS WE PROVIDE. THREE MEALS A DAY. NURSING P. T. O. T. HOME HEALTHCARE SPEECH THERAPY. AND AND YET THE STATE REIMBURSE US UP AT ABOUT SEVENTY SIX DOLLARS A DAY PER PARTICIPANT. AND THAT RATE HAS NOT GOTTEN UP AS YOU HEARD FROM MY COLLEAGUES SO WE URGE YOU TO BRENDA'S THIS TWENTY PERCENT INCREASE SO WE'LL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THESE. REALLY COMMUNITY BASED BUT VERY VERY EFFECTIVE COST EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE AND KEEP OUR SENIORS IN THE COMMUNITY AND IN THEIR OWN HOMES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH BECAME.

AND OF THOSE THIRTY TWO THIRTEEN COUNTIES HAVE FIVE OR FEWER CENTERS. SO WE'VE. LOST INFRASTRUCTURE AT THE SAME TIME THAT THE DEMOGRAPHICS OF AGING AND OUR STATE AS MOLLY DEPRIVE JUST FOR HER.

AND WE TAKE KIDS FROM OUR YOUNG THIS IS ABOUT TWO MONTHS OLD THERE A LOT OF KIDS WHO ARE PREMATURE. WITH SUCH APLOMB BIRTH DEFECTS ARE HARD ISSUES LONG ISSUES MAYBE THE YOUNGER ONE OF A TWIN THAT DOESN'T QUITE. IS IT PULL IT FULLY DEVELOPED AND WE WORK VERY HARD TO GET THESE KIDS OFFENSE AND HOME. RUN OUR STAFF IS HIGHLY EDUCATED WE HAVE ALL KINDS RE HAVE WE HAVE OUR RIGHTS RIGHT THERE THIS AGAIN OUR DOCTORS ARE NOT INTENSE VISIT UCLA. NURSES. AND WE TAKE IS VERY FRAGILE KIDS AND TRY TO MAKE THEM AS WHOLE AS POSSIBLE. AND OUR GOAL IS TO GET THEM OFF THE VAN AND GET THEM HOME. GIFT IF POSSIBLE BOUNCE RESERVE THESE KIDS WE ALSO SERVED ON KIDS WHO ARE NEAR DROWNING CLIENTS. KIDS YOUR CAR ACCIDENTS. A WE TAKE INSURANCE BUT THE PROBLEM WITH THEM. WITH. THE INSURANCE SYSTEM IS AFTER A HUNDRED TWENTY DAYS IF YOU HAVE GOOD INSURANCE EVERYTHING GOES TO MEDI CAL. SO WE ARE ON OUR MEDICAL FUND. AND OUR RATE IS WE'RE LOOKING AT A RATE THAT'S WHAT BROUGHT US HERE IS TRYING TO STRUGGLE WITH WE'RE ACTION IN OUR AREA THAT HOW. ARE THE FIRE IN THE FLOOD AND SO WE'RE IN A ROOM WHERE THE NEW YORK TIMES FOR FOR. NOT THE REASONS WE WANT TO BE. THAT WE DON'T HAVE FUNDS NOW TO CLEAN UP THE PARKING LOT SIR RATES BEEN FROZEN FOR TEN YEARS. AND THERE'S ONLY FOR A. FREE STANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE THEIR. AND WE ALL LOOKED AT OUR COST REPORTS AND WE'RE GETTING PAID UNDER WHAT THE COST REPORTS WOULD SUGGEST. SOME ASK WE ARE ASKING FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO. HELP STOP THE BLEEDING AND AT THIS POINT WE'RE IN A SITUATION WHERE. I'VE BEEN THERE SO LONG YOU GET ATTACHED TO THESE KIDS WE SEE THE DEVASTATION OF THESE FAMILIES WHO COME IN. WHO WERE HOPING FOR AT INTACT CHILD AND DON'T HAVE ONE OR THEY HADN'T TALKED CHILD ENOUGH CERTAIN? THEY DON'T AND IN SO IT'S. IT'S A HORRIFYING THING TO SEE BUT THEN YOU SEE THE MIRACULOUS HEALING THAT COMES WITH THAT.

IT'S BRIGHT WE HAVE ACTIVITIES TO TRY TO GET THE KIDS OUT AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. WE WANT THEM TO BE ARM. EMOTIONALLY ENGAGED AND READY TO ENTER THE WORLD AT WHATEVER LEVEL THEY'RE READY TO GO ON. BUT IT'S HARD TO DO WITH NOT HAVING ANY INCREASES AND WE ALL KNOW THAT. HEALTHCARE IS RISING AND SO WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO. INCREASE OUR STAFF ARE WEIRD A POINT NOW WHERE WE'RE LOOKING AT. DO WE PAY FOR THE DRIVEWAY OR DO WE PAY FOR. AND THE THIS VENDOR HAD WE MEET PAYROLL AND WE'RE FIVE STAR FACILITY IN OUR PART MANY PFIZER FACILITIES. AND I THINK THAT. I'M HERE BECAUSE I PHILIP WE ARE AT A PLACE WHERE. IF WE KEEP GOING IN THE RIGHT THE ROAD WE'RE GOING WE'RE GONNA BE ASKED TO I'M. TO. PROVIDE. TO CUT DOWN THE CARE THAT WE PROVIDE AND I THINK IT'S IMMORAL AND I DON'T THINK THAT. WE CAN'T DO THAT AND SO THAT WOULD MEAN THAT THESE KIDS GO BACK TO AN ICY YOU AND GET STUCK THERE FOR. THAT'S WHY WE ARE DEVELOPED ACTUALLY IS TO GET KIDS OUT OF THE ICU AND TO GIVE MY QUALITY OF LIFE. AND SO ON. SO I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. AND I AGAIN ASK FOR FOUR MILLION DOLLARS TO HEL US.

WE CAN. GOOD EVENING MATT ROBINSON THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF HEALTH FACILITIES THAT REPRESENTS GOVERNOR SUBSIDES IN CALIFORNIA AND THESE ARE GREAT MEMBERS THAT WERE VERY MUCH IN SUPPORT OF THIS. THEY ARE A HUNDRED PERCENT MEDI CAL FUNDED I'D IS VERY VERY OBVIOUSLY DIFFICULT FOR THEM TO EVEN COVER THE COST WITH THAT MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT. ESPECIALLY WITH THAT RATE FREEZE THAT THEY'VE HAD OVER THE YEARS ON THE HOUSES HAD A VERY GOOD JOB. IN DEPICTING THE PROBLEM AND AGAIN WE ARE AT YOUR SPORT THANK YOU. WHERE MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION ALSO PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE FOR THE REASONS ALREADY STATED? THE COMMAND.

THANK YOU MISSED AN ITEM FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I WOULD ASK A SIMILAR TO THE LAST ISSUE. THAT YOU WORK WITH OUR COMMITTEE STAFF TO SEE IF THIS IS A POTENTIAL USE OF PROP FIFTY SIX. FUNDS AND WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE NINE OPEN. I'M GOING TO DINNER WITH YOU LATER TONIGHT IF YOU. MANY BOND ISSUE TEN GOOD EVENING I'M MICHAEL DAY WITH CHILDREN NOW REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION AND SEVERAL WRAPPED THE PARTNERS. PLEASED TO BE HERE TODAY TO TALK ABOUT PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH. IN MEDI CAL. WITH AVAILABILITY OF MILLIONS OF OF DOLLARS OF ADDITIONAL PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS AND BUILDING ON THE DEPARTMENT'S CURRENT APPROACH TO THE SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS. WE PUT FORTH A TARGETED CHILDREN'S HEALTH INVESTMENT APPROACH TO IT ADDRESS ACCESS ISSUES AFFECTING CHILDREN IN THREE AREAS TO WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN HURT BY THE SUBCOMMITTEE. TO JUST QUICKLY TO RECAP. THE THREE DISTINCT COMPONENTS ARE FIRST WE RECOMMEND USING A PORTION OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS UP FOR TARGETED SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENT RATE INCREASES. IN PEDIATRIC PREVENTIVE SERVICES WHICH MAKE UP THE VAST MAJORITY OF SERVICES THAT MOST KIDS NEED. AND THESE ARE THINGS LIKE WELL CHILD VISITS DEVELOPMENTAL SCREENINGS AND OTHER SERVICES A RECOMMENDED BY THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS. THIS ITEM WAS HEARD AT THE MARCH FIFTH SUBCOMMITTEE HEARING. SECOND OH WE RECOMMEND USING A PORTION THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS TO A TARGET SUPPLEMENTAL DENTAL RATE INCREASES THINGS LIKE FLUORIDE VARNISH APPLICATION. ARM AND REMOVAL OF ORTHODOX A PERFORMER FOSTER YOUTH AND THIS WAS HEARD JUST LAST WEEK ON APRIL THIRTIETH. AND THEN FINALLY WE RECOMMEND USING A PORTION. OF THE PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS FOR MODEST INCREASE TO THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES CCS RATE OF TEN PERCENT UPPER OUTPATIENT POSITION SERVICES AND MY COLLEAGUE WILL SAY MORE ABOUT THAT. I AARON KELLY WITH THE ABOUT CHILDREN SPECIALTY CARE COALITION I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS BUDGET REQUEST. OUR MISSION IS TO ENSURE ACCESS TO QUALITY AND TIMELY CARE FOR CHILDREN WITH COMPLEX HEALTH CARE NEEDS. IT IS WELL DOCUMENTED IN MANY SURVEYS AND REPORTS INCLUDING CSE SIS MEMBER ACCESS SURVEY THAT FAMILIES CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES ACCESSING SPECIALTY CARE HERE IN CALIFORNIA. TIMELY ACCESS TO PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY AND SUB SPECIALTY PROVIDERS IS ESSENTIAL. DELAYS IN CARE COULD NOT ONLY RESULT IN POOR OUTCOMES BUT ALSO GREATER COST TO THE HEALTHCARE SYSTEM AS A WHOLE. THE DEMAND FOR PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY CARE SERVICES IS ALSO ON THE RISE WHICH CHILDREN WITH MEDICAL COMPLEXITY LIVING LONGER. AND AN INCREASING NUMBER OF CHILDREN DIAGNOSED WITH CONDITIONS LIKE DIABETES. DEPENDING ON THE REGION ANYWHERE FROM FIFTY PERCENT UP TO EIGHTY PERCENT OF PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY CARE MEDICAL GROUPS. PATIENTS ARE ON MEDI CAL WITH MANY AND ROLLED IN THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S SERVICES PROGRAM WHICH IS STILL LARGELY A FEE FOR SERVICE DELIVERY SYSTEM IN THE STATE. THERE ARE A HUNDRED AND EIGHTY NINE THOUSAND CHILDREN ENROLLED IN CCS THESE CHILDREN HAVE LIFE THREATENING COMPLEX AND CHRONIC DISEASES WHERE ACCESS TO CARE IS PARTICULARLY VITAL. AS MY COLLEAGUE MISTER A DAY NOTED IN HIS REMARKS WE PROPOSE USING PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDING TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AND TARGETED INCREASE OF TEN PERCENT TO THE CCS RATE FOR OUTPATIENT POSITION SERVICES. THERE'S NOT BEEN AN INCREASE IN THE CCS RATE FOR NEARLY TWO DECADES THAT WOULD BRING RATES CLOSER TO MEDICARE AND MOST NOTABLY HELPED PEDIATRIC SPECIALTY MEDICAL GROUPS RECRUIT QUALIFIED PHYSICIANS. VETERAN SHORT SUPPLY AS WELL AS RETAIN TOP TALENT. STAY AND PRACTICE HERE IN OUR GOLDEN STATE. LASTLY THIS FUNDING WILL NOT ONLY BENEFIT CHILDREN IN CCS BUT WILL BENEFIT ALL CHILDREN IN FAMILIES THAT ARE IN NEED OF SPECIALTY CARE. I WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND THANK YOU AGAIN. HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. A MERE MORE. DEAR MARTIN HERE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE WE ACTUALLY SUPPORT OF ALL THREE COMPONENTS OF IT. A BUT JUST ONE EMPHASIZE THAT PREVENTIVE CARE IS NOT JUST ABOUT PRIMARY CARE IT'S ALSO MAKING SURE THAT WHEN KIDS LEAVE THE HOSPITAL. AND THEY HAVE COMPLEX MEDICAL CONDITIONS THAT CAN GET IN TO SEE THE SPECIALIST OTHERWISE THEY JUST END UP BACK IN OUR ER'S THAN BACK IN OUR ROOMS AND WE'D MUCH RATHER HAVE THAT NOT HAPPEN SO WE'RE PLEASED TO SUPPORT THIS TODAY. INHUMAN. ON THE HOUSE ABOUT WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL THE COMMAND. WHICH ALSO PREVENTS HE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT OWN LOOKING BACK IN THE TWO THOUSAND AND SIXTEEN ELECTION ONE OF THE THINGS THAT. WAS PROMISED UNDER PROP FIFTY SIX WAS AT AN IMPROVEMENT IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND WE THINK THAT ALL THREE. COMPONENTS OF THIS PROPOSAL ARE REALLY CRITICAL TO ENSURING THAT CHILDREN HAVE ACCESS TO THE. CRITICAL SERVICES THEY NEED THANK YOU THINK YOU. HI KRISTIN GOLDEN TEST WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP IN STRONG SUPPORT. GIVE. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUED I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. SEEING NO COMMENTS I JUST HAVE ONE QUESTION. A TEN PERCENT INCREASE IS THERE A DOLLAR AMOUNT THAT WERE LOOKING OUT FOR A GIVEN YEAR DO WE HAVE ANY. APPROXIMATIONS FOR WHAT THAT ROAD EQUATES TO. NO NOT CURRENTLY BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE DEPARTMENT AND FINANCE ON THAT HOT AND WE A CERTAIN REPORT BACK TO TO COMMITTEE STAFF GRID. WITH THAT WILL HOLD ISSUE TEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE ELEVEN THANK YOU. IF YOU ISSUE ELEVEN. I. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ANA ACTON THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. MANY MISS ON ACT AND I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR FREED WERE AN AGING AND DISABILITY RESOURCE CENTER. YOU'VE PROBABLY AWARE OF THE STATE AUDITOR. JUST RELEASED A REPORT ON THE CALIFORNIA SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES. SHOWING CHALLENGES WERE CAUGHT QUALITY OF CARE AND OVERSIGHT. NOW MORE THAN EVER IT IS IMPORTANT FOR PEOPLE HOW THE OPTION TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. OF THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY TRANSITION OR CCT WHICH HELPS INDIVIDUALS TRANSITION FROM LONG TERM. INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS BACK INTO COMMUNITY LIVING. THE FUNDING FOR THIS CRITICAL PROGRAM IS PHASING OUT AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND THE STATE HAS NOT PROPOSED ITS CONTINUATION BEYOND THIS CALENDAR YEAR. WE'RE ASKING FOR THE STATE TO CONTINUE FUNDING CCT AT NINETEEN POINT ONE MILLION AN ON GOING GENERAL FUND DOLLARS. TO REFLECT BOTH THE STATE CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE DISCONTINUED FEDERAL FUNDS THE UP FRONT INVESTMENT IS ESTIMATED TO RESULT IN A TOTAL SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY TWENTY EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS. ACROSS CALIFORNIA CCT HELPS INDIVIDUALS WHO DESIRE TO LIVE IN THE COMMUNITY BUT WHO ARE CONFINED TO INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS AND WHO OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RETURN TO THE COMMUNITY. TAKE FOR EXAMPLE KATIE WHO LOS EVERYTHING AFTER AN ACCIDENT BEFORE SHE FOUND CCT SHE HAD NO HOPE OF LIVING OUTSIDE AND NURSING HOME. CTT MADE IT POSSIBLE FOR HER TO APPLY FOR AND SECURE AN APARTMENT PURCHASE HOUSEHOLD ITEMS MAKE HOME MODIFICATIONS. INCREASE INDEPENDENCE THE RECESS OF TECHNOLOGY AND SUPPLY THE SUPPORT TO HELP HER PUT TOGETHER CARE TEAM AND SECURE THE ONGOING SUPPORT SHE NEEDS TO LIVE SAFELY IN THE COMMUNITY. FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS SHE NOW LIVES INDEPENDENTLY AND CONTRIBUTES TO OUR COMMUNITY ASSESS THAT BOTH ON THE STATE AND LOCAL. YES WITH EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS. SILICATES A TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY SUPPORT GROUP MENTORS YOUTH AND IS ENGAGED WITH A CHURCH. AS YOU CAN SEE FROM KITTY STORY CCT TRANSITION TEAMS WORK WITH INDIVIDUALS THAT THE BALLOT. SAFE TRANSITION PLAN THAT IDENTIFIES AND CONNECT THEM WITH THE HOUSING AND COMMUNITY SUPPORTS NECESSARY. FOR SUCCESSFUL TRANSITION THERE IS NO OTHER PROGRAM OR SERVICE LIKE THIS. THIS PROGRAM IS BOTH COST EFFECTIVE AND IN LINE WITH THE STATE'S EFFORTS TO UPHOLD THE US SUPREME COURT'S OLMSTEAD DECISION WHICH FOUND THAT UNDER THE ADA INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE RIGHT TO LIVE AND THE LEAST RESTRICTIVE SETTING. SINCE TWO THOUSAND AND EIGHT THE CCT PROGRAM HAS HELPED OVER THIRTY FIVE INDIVIDUALS LIKE KATIE MOVE FROM INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS THAT THE COMMUNITY. THESE TRANSITIONS RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT SAVINGS THE STATE AVERAGING SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PARTICIPANT PER YEAR. UNFORTUNATELY AT THE DEPARTMENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES IS PLANNING ON PHASING OUT THIS VALUABLE PROGRAM. THE STATE INDICATES THAT THE TRANSITION SERVICES CAN CONTINUE. UNDER THE HOME AND COMMUNITY BASED ALTERNATIVES WAIVER. YET THIS DOESN'T COMPORT AS THE ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AND SERVICES OFFERED UNDER THE WAIVER PROGRAM ARE DIFFERENT AND THE TRANSITION COSTS ARE NOT REIMBURSED. WITHOUT FUNDING DESIGNATED SPECIFICALLY FOR CTT PROGRAMS WILL NOT BE ABLE TO HELP INDIVIDUALS LIKE KATIE MOVE OUT OF INSTITUTIONAL SETTINGS. SO FINALLY IMAGINE FOR A MOMENT. THAT BY CIRCUMSTANCE OR THAT YOU'RE AGING INTO AN INSTITUTION. SITUATION A YEAR AGING INTO A SITUATION WHERE YOU NO LONGER COULD CHOOSE WHEN YOU EAT WHAT YOU E.. WHEN YOU SHOWERED WHEN YOU USE THE BATHROOM OR EVEN WHAT TELEVISION SHOW YOU WATCHED AND THAT YOU WERE SHARING A ROOM WHICH IS NOW YOUR HOME WITH SOMEONE YOU NEVER KNEW AND IMAGINE THIS COST YOUR STATE MILLIONS MORE DOLLARS THAN DOING SOMETHING DIFFERENT. AND BETTER LIKE CCT. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME AND AYE ABBOTT HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU. BUT WE HAVE ONE COMMENT BEFORE WE TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT A WE HAD A QUESTION ON THE STAFF COMMENT SECTION FOR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR WHETHER DIPLOMATIC AS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WITH RESPECT TO THE SAVINGS ATTHE NET SAVINGS TO THE STATE WERE STILL EVALUATING THIS COMPONENT AND WILL FOLLOW UP WITH THEIR STAFF. WHEN THAT IS AVAILABLE CREEK THANK YOU. WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE ELEVEN HI MY NAME IS KATIE AM I JUST WANTED TO. LET IT BE KNOWN THAT I WAS THIRTY FOUR YEARS OLD AT THE TIME OF MY ACCIDENT IT WAS THAT GENERAL ACCIDENT NOTHING IN THAT AT BALL. I WAS PLACED INTO A FACILITY. LAUGHED PARALYZED COMPLETELY HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THE CCT PROGRAM TO GIVE ME A CHANCE TO GET OUT I WOULD HAVE BEEN LEFT COMPLETELY PARALYZED. UPON THREE MONTHS AFTER COMING HOME I STARTED INTENSIVE PHYSICAL THERAPY THAT FACILITY WOULD NOT PROVIDE IT. I STARTED FOUR DAYS A WEEK AND WITHIN THREE MONTHS I WAS ABLE TO STAND UP I AM NOW USING A PLATFORM WALKER. AT FOR THE MAJORITY OF MY JOAQUIN AND A WHEELCHAIR JUSTICE THAT CAUTIONARY THING THIS WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AN OPTION HAD I BEEN LEFT I WAS LEFT IN THE BED. UNATTENDED WITH NO PHYSICAL THERAPY THEY CHARGED MY INSURANCE FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH I HAVE MY OWN APARTMENT MY OWN CARE GIVERS AND. IT'S NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS A MONTH WITH THIS PROGRAM I WAS ABLE TO COME HOME AND. BE A NORMAL HUMAN BEING AGAIN AT AT MY AGE. EVEN AT YOUR AGE YOU CAN NEVER MATCH AND WHAT IT WAS LIKE MY FORMER CAREER WAS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT. AND EMERGENCY MEDICAL I NEVER IMAGINED THAT THIS WOULD BE THE ASIDE THAT I WOULD HAVE BEEN ON. BUT HAD IT NOT BEEN FOR THIS PROGRAM I STILL WOULD HAVE BEEN ENOUGH FACILITY AND NOT KNOWING I WAS ABLE TO WALK I CAN EVEN LEFT MY HANDS IN MY ARMS. ORIGINALLY DIAGNOSED WITH NO NO PARENT NO FUTURE OF JOAQUIN ARE USING YOUR ARMS. ALL IT TOOK WAS GUIDE AND FOR SOMEBODY THE ELSE THAT HELP THEM BELIEVE IN ME. THANK YOU I HOPE YOU REALLY CONSIDER THIS PROGRAM THANK YOU MA'AM. A FAIR. WONDERFUL WONDERFUL TESTIFY OR THANK YOU DE ON AARON ON BEHALF OF EAST BAY INNOVATIONS WERE ONE OF THE COMMUNITY BASED COMPOUND PROVIDERS THAT DOES CCT IN OUR OWN COMMUNITY. I WANTED TO CORRECT ONE THING THAT ON A SAID IT WAS AROUND THIRTY FIVE HUNDRED PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PLACED THROUGH CCT NOT THIRTY FIVE. WE'VE PLACE HUNDREDS OURSELVES IN THE EAST BAY WHAT'S BEEN AMAZING ABOUT THIS IS THAT THE INTEREST IN OUR COMMUNITY NOW HAS GROWN SO SIGNIFICANTLY THAT WE ARE WORKING WITH A VARIETY OF DEVELOPERS. WHO ARE NOW SHOWING AN INTEREST IN PROVIDING APARTMENTS TO PEOPLE UP THROUGH CCT RIGHT AND FORMING THESE KINDS OF PARTNERSHIPS WHICH HAS TAKEN YEARS TO DEVELOP? IT WOULD BE A SHAME NOW TO TERMINATE THIS PROGRAM NOW THAT WE'VE GOT DEVELOPERS AND BUILDERS INTERESTED IN PROVIDING THE KIND OF APARTMENTS AND LIVING SPACES THAT. PARTICIPANTS CAN PARTICIPATE AND WE'RE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE WITH INTELLECTUAL DISABILITIES AS WELL AS AND SENIORS ARM WHO ARE INAPPROPRIATELY PLACED IN NURSING HOMES. AND IT'S AT THE COST SAVINGS OF SIXTY THOUSAND DOLLARS PER YEAR PER PATIENT THIS IS A DEAL EVERYBODY WHY WOULD WE PASS IT UP BANKS THANK YOU. HELLO AKSHARA CUT SIGN AM BEHALF OF STATE INDEPENDENT LIVING COUNCIL. O. WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL NOT ONLY BECAUSE. IT BENEFITS CONSUMERS LIKE KATIE AND MANY OTHERS ACROSS THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. YOU YOUNG ADULTS ARE YOUNG PEOPLE OLDER ADULTS. AND EVERYONE IN BETWEEN HOME OUR DEPARTMENT SUPPORTS TWENTY EIGHT INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTERS ACROSS THE STATE WHICH PROVIDE THESE TYPES OF SERVICES ALREADY. HOME WITH HIM WITHOUT THE HELP OF THE SIXTY PROGRAM BUT. THERE'S A DEFINITE CONCRETE COST BENEFIT TO THIS PROGRAM SO WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE CONTINUANCE OF LOS. THE HUMAN. HI MY NAME IS PATTY GRABS WITH INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER OF KERN COUNTY FROM BAKERSFIELD AND I'M A CCT COORDINATOR AND I STRONGLY OF. HOUSE THAT YOU SUPPORT THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. HER CHILD DISABILITY RIGHTS CALIFORNIA WHERE ONE OF THE SPONSORS OF THIS PROPOSAL AND THIS IS ONE OF THOSE UNIQUE TIMES THAT WE ACTUALLY GET TO SEE. IN THE ESTIMATES PAGES THE SAVINGS THAT THIS PROGRAM PRODUCES AND HAS PRODUCED A OVER THE YEARS SO THE NUMBERS THAT YOU'VE SEEN IN THE. ANALYSIS BY THE. COMMITTEE STAFF REFLECT THOSE THAT HAVE BEEN IN THE ESTIMATES PAGES WHAT IS CRITICAL I THINK FOR THIS PROGRAM IS THAT. THE THE PROGRAM DOESN'T ACTUALLY THE FEDERAL FUNDING DOES NOT EXPIRE UNTIL TWENTY TWENTY BUT WHAT THE THE SERVICES ARE PROVIDED OVER A COURSE OF A YEAR ONCE INDIVIDUALS ARE IN THE PROGRAM. SO THEY'RE STARTING THE GLIDE PATH OUT WHICH WOULD BE IN THE CALENDAR YEAR. IT AT THE END OF THE CALENDAR YEAR SO IT'S A CRUCIAL TO KEEP THE STRUCTURE IN PLACE AND THERE IS SOME HOPE THAT THIS IS A PROGRAM THROUGH THE EMPOWER ACT THAT WILL GET RE AUTHORIZED BY CONGRESS. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU FOR LISTENING TO MY COMMENTS IN THAT COMMENCEMENT OTHER FOLKS HAVE SPOKEN BEHIND ME AYE MY NAME'S JIMMY SOTO I'M THE EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR. FOR THE INDEPENDENT LIVING CENTER KERN COUNTY HAVE ACTUALLY STARTED THIS PROGRAM AND FRESNO. HAVE BACK IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN NINETY STARTED THE SAME PROGRAM IN BAKERSFIELD ABOUT FOUR YEARS AGO BUT. I CAN TELL YOU THAT THIS IS A VERY VERY POWERFUL PROGRAM THAT I THINK EVERYBODY WHETHER YOU'RE IN THIS FIELD ARE NOT WOULD UNDERSTAND. AND IT'S WHEN YOU SEE A PERSON LIKE KATIE GET OUT OF A NURSING HOME AND GOING TO THE HER HER OWN APARTMENT. AND THEY HAVE TEARS IN THEIR EYES TELLING YOU. THINKING YOU. BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT TO DIE IN THAT NURSING HOME AND I THINK. THOSE TYPES OF EXPERIENCES GET ME MOTIVATED A LOT THERE A LOT OF OTHER FOLKS ARE MOTIVATED. IT'S ALSO A WIN WIN JUST LIKE WHAT KURT SAID IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S GONNA SAVE TAXPAYER DOLLARS AND AYE IF YOU DIDN'T KNOW THAT. EVERY SINGLE ONE OF THESE PEOPLE ARE I'M MEDI CAL. SO IF THEY'RE IN THE NURSING HOME. EVERYBODY IN THIS ROOM WAS PAYING FOR THEM TO STAY IN THAT ROOM. AND OF COURSE THE BIGGEST REASONS FOR GETTING PEOPLE DISABILITIES AND SENIORS OUT OF NURSING HOMES TITUS ASSET YOU. REALLY CONSIDER THAT THE WIN WIN SOLUTION ON THIS THIS BUDGET PROPOSAL AND I THINK YOU CAN FOR YOUR TIME. THANK YOU SIR. I WORK. MY NEXT CALIFORNIA'S DISABILITY RIGHTS SHE DID A GREAT JOB SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT THE PRACTICE THAT. INDEPENDENCE IS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR CLIENTS VERY IMPORTANT TO OUR MEMBERS WE HAVE PEOPLE WHO THAT.

DESPITE THE ACTUALLY APPROVED THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM WHICH IS A PROGRAM THAT PROVIDES PREVENTIVE SERVICES FOR PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRE DIABETES WHICH IS A RISK FACTOR FOR DIABETES. SINCE THE TIME THAT THAT WAS APPROVED OF THE FIVE MILLION DOLLAR ALLOCATION FROM THE GENERAL FUND THAT'S MATCHED WITH FUNDS FROM CMS. AND SINCE THAT TIME ON THERE HAS BEEN A COALITION WHICH WAS CONVENED TO DISCUSS THE IMPLEMENTATION AND PREPARE THE DEPARTMENT HEALTHCARE SERVICES. AS WELL AS. THROUGH THE PUBLIC FOCUS SERVICES TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IS NECESSARY FOR PROPER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAM. IN THE PROCESS OF DOING THAT WE DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE SEVERAL THINGS THAT WOULD HELP THE PROGRAM BE IMPLEMENTED APPROPRIATELY. THE FIRST OF WHICH IS ADDRESSING BE LINGUISTIC REQUIREMENTS FOR MEDICAID AND FOR MEDI CAL TO BE ABLE TO HAVE THE PROGRAM AVAILABLE AT ALL OF THE THRESHOLD LANGUAGES. THEIR THIRTEEN THRESHOLD LANGUAGES IN CALIFORNIA AND THE CURRENT CURRICULUM IS ONLY AVAILABLE INTO ENGLISH AND SPANISH. AND SO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE AND THAT THEIR STANDARDIZED IN A WAY THAT MAKES SENSE. AND THAT WAS NOT DUPLICATIVE WE ARE REQUESTING FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS TO BE ABLE TO TRANSLATE THE OTHER INTO THE OTHER ELEVEN LANGUAGES. THIS WOULD ALLOW FOR EVERYONE WHO IS IMPLEMENTING THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM IN CALIFORNIA TO BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS TO A STANDARDIZED CURRICULUM THAT HAS BEEN APPROVED TRANSLATION. IN ADDITION WE ALSO FOUND TWO FIXES THAT NEEDED TO TAKE PLACE IN HOME IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION ONE IS AROUND. THE FIVE PERCENT WEIGHT LOSS REQUIREMENT FOR ONGOING SERVICES THE CDC HAS. HEADS OF ROBUST AMOUNT OF DATA SHOWING THAT WEIGHT LOSS AT LOWER AMOUNTS LOWER THRESHOLDS ON IS ACTUALLY ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THE OUTCOMES WERE INTERESTED IN INCLUDING PREVENTING THE ONSET OF DIABETES. AND SO ON THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS RIGHT NOW CONSIDERING WHETHER A LOWER THRESHOLD WILL ACTUALLY BE USED AND SO WE WOULD RATHER RATHER THAN STATE. A SPECIFIC THRESHOLD THE BACKROOM MATCH OURSELVES WITH WHAT THE CDC HAS AND SO WE ARE ASKING THAT THAT BE TAKEN OUT OF THE CURRENT. WELFARE INSTITUTIONS CODE I'M IN ADDITION WERE ALSO ASKING THAT. THE ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA THAT ARE SPECIFICALLY STATED HARM IN THE CURRENT LEGISLATION BE REMOVED AS WELL BECAUSE THEY DIFFER FROM THE CDC AND THAT WOULD RENDER MANY PEOPLE WHO ARE ACTUALLY ELIGIBLE FOR THE PROGRAM BASED ON CDC STANDARDS. THAT WOULD RENDER THEM ILL INELIGIBLE AND THE GOAL OF THE PROGRAM IS TO BE ABLE TO HAVE AS MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE PRE DIABETES AS POSSIBLE PARTICIPATE. NOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN SUPPORT. KIMBERLY CHANNEL BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA PAN ETHNIC HEALTH THAT WORK IN SUPPORT. MARY VALDEZ HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU ANY OPPOSITION. SEEN NON BACK TO THE DICE. I JUST WANNA THANK YOU FOR THE PROPOSAL IT'S QUITE WELL RECEIVED. WAS ECSTATIC WHEN WE AS A STATE LAST YEAR WERE ABLE TO IMPLEMENT THIS AND. I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU SHORTLY. THANK YOU WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWELVE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE THIRTEEN. GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS ANA HOUSE ABOUT WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA THANK YOU TO THE DOCTOR ARAMBULA MEMBERS AND STAFF YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE INTEGRATION. OF HEALTH AND EDUCATION OUTCOMES AND WELL BEING OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA NOW MORE THAN EVER THE COMMITMENT TO A SCHOOL CLIMATE THAT RECOGNIZES HEALTH AS BEING INTIMATELY LINKED TO LEARNING. IS CRUCIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF STUDENTS. THAT IS WHY UNITED WAYS ALONG WITH THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH COVERAGE COALITION AND MANY OTHERS ARE PROUD TO SUPPORT THE BUDGET REQUEST FOR THE HEALTHY START INITIATIVE. TO PROVIDE PLANNING GRANTS TO LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES TO BETTER COORDINATE THE ARRAY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES THAT CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR AND NEED. I'M GONNA FOCUS MY BRIEF COMMENTS ON THE ROLL THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WOULD PLAY WITHIN THE HEALTHY START PROPOSAL. WE KNOW THAT A COLLABORATION ACROSS THE ARRAY OF SERVICES AT THE LOCAL LEVEL IS ONE OF THE CORNERSTONES OF SUCCESS AND THIS HOLDS TRUE AT THE STATE LEVEL AS WELL WITH SO MANY SERVICES AND FUNDING SOURCES NOW FURTHER DEVOLVED. AND SILENT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THE LACK OF COORDINATION MEANS CHILDREN AND FAMILIES ARE FALLING THROUGH THE GAPS AND THAT SHOULD BE PREVENTED. WHAT IS NEEDED? IN THIS RE ENVISIONED HEALTHY START IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE FROM THE H. CS ON HOW LOCAL COLLABORATIVE'S CAN MOST EFFICIENTLY LEVERAGE THE VARIOUS. VARIOUS HEALTH SERVICE STREAMS AND EFFECTIVELY DRAWDOWN ON MATCHING FEDERAL FUNDS LIKE LTA. BILLING OPTION AND MA. ADDITIONALLY THERE IS A PRESSING NEED FOR DH CS TO WORK TOGETHER WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION IN IMPLEMENTING SCHOOL BASED HEALTH POLICY IN SERVICES. HEALTHY START WOULD ESTABLISH THIS INTER AGENCY COORDINATION IN A TANGIBLE WAY THROUGH THE VERY MODEST INVESTMENT AS LISTED IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA TODAY. PROMOTING CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS HIGHLY COST EFFECTIVE FOR SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES FUND THE COLLECTING IT MEANS SPIRALING COSTS FOR HEALTHCARE AND SOCIAL SERVICES. A FOCUS ON PREVENTION AND COLLABORATION TO ENSURE ADEQUATE ACCESS TO SERVICES WHILE AVOIDING DUPLICATING A DUPLICATION OF THOSE SERVICES IS A CORE TENANT OF HEALTH CARE REFORM. THANK YOU FOR YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS ISSUE OF I WOULD NOTE THAT WE ARE NOW WORKING ON THE SENATE SIDE AND WILL BE HEARD IN THE EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE. I WILL BE WORKING WITH THE EDUCATION SUBCOMMITTEE ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE AS WELL MOVING FORWARD ON THIS PROPOSAL UNDERSTANDING THAT THE MAJORITY OF THE PROPOSAL WOULD BE. AND THAT SORT OF FINANCIAL JURISDICTION BUT APPRECIATE YOUR TIME LISTENING TO THIS UP. PROPOSAL TODAY THE THANK YOU ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT WHEN THE AT TIMES RIGHT THANK YOU MA'AM. BOB NOW FOR PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE THIRTEEN. HI I'M CHRIS SINGLETON TEST WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP IN STRONG SUPPORT. YOU CAN. MY GOOD WITH CHILDREN AND STRONG SUPPORT. MICHELLE SOBRE MINSKY CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT THE COMMAND. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. SEEING NO COMMENTS. THE PROPOSAL IS WELL RECEIVED AND LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH YOU. TO HOLD ISSUE THIRTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE FOURTEEN. HELLO AGAIN. FEET HIGH I'M CHRISTIAN GOLDEN TESTED WITH THE CHILDREN'S PARTNERSHIP AND ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH COALITION. OF CALIFORNIA WE WOULD PUT FORWARD THIS PROPOSAL TO HELP THEM CONTINUE THE RECEIVING. VALUABLE DATA. OF FINE CHILDREN'S HEALTH CARE UTILIZATION AND HEALTH COVERAGE IN CALIFORNIA. AS YOU KNOW THE CALIFORNIA HEALTH INTERVIEW SURVEY OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CHESS HAS BEEN A VALUABLE SOURCE OF INFORMATION ON. ALL SORTS OF ISSUES AROUND HEALTH CARE AND HEALTH COVERAGE NAMELY HOW MANY TO UNINSURED CHILDREN HOW MANY UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS THERE ARE IN CALIFORNIA AND IN PARTICULAR. I CAN GET TOWN TO DISTRICT LEVEL AND SO MOST THE DATA YOU PROBABLY HAVE ABOUT PEOPLE IN YOUR COMMUNITY PROBABLY OF COME FROM THE CHEST STATUS LAST SET. NOW WHAT DUMB WE'VE HEARD FROM THE RESEARCHERS IS THAT. THEY ARE NOT GETTING ENOUGH SAMPLES AND RESPONDERS ON CHILDREN'S INFORMATION SO IF UNLESS THEY MAKE SOME CHANGES THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO REPORT. ON ANYTHING LESS AND STATE LEVEL DATA. ON THESE CHILDREN MEASURES AND THIS IS OF COURSE REALLY TROUBLING. AND THAT WE WON'T BE ABLE TO GET SOME REALLY VALUABLE INFORMATION SO THERE RIGHT NOW DOING A LOT OF. WORK ON TRYING TO CHANGE THEIR METHODOLOGY SO AS TO GET MORE RESPONDER STE ON I'VE FOR CHILDREN'S INFORMATION SO AS YOU CAN IMAGINE IT'S GETTING A CALL ON THE PHONE. ABOUT A FORTY FIVE MINUTE INTERVIEW ON YOUR HEALTH INFORMATION THEN SAYING HAITI OF ANOTHER FORTY FIVE MINUTES TO ASK ABOUT YOUR CHILD. YOU CAN SEE HOW A LOT OF PEOPLE MAY NOT BE FOLLOWING THROUGH ON THAT SECOND PART TO GET THE INFORMATION ON THE CHILD SO THEY'RE TRYING TO. LOOK AT DIFFERENT WAYS OF DOING THIS METHODOLOGY THEREIN AT STAGE ONE OF IT RIGHT NOW WHICH THE FOUNDATIONS HAVE SUPPORTED AND PAID FOR AND STAGE TWO IS TO WORK ON SOME OF THE OTHER FEATURES FOR EXAMPLE THEY'RE DOING AN ONLINE. AN INTERVIEW AS A WAY TO ENCOURAGE MAYBE SOME ADOLESCENTS TO RESPOND ON THEIR OWN AND RIGHT NOW IT IS NOT IN A SPANISH SO THEY'D LIKE TO MAKE IT IN SPANISH AND THEY'RE ALSO TESTING METHODOLOGICAL CHANGES WHERE THEY MAY ASK FIRST ABOUT THE CHILD RATHER THAN ABOUT. THE ADULT TO CHILD UP THAT. A RESPONSE ON THE CHILDREN'S INFORMATION THIS BUDGET REQUEST IS FOR SEVEN HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND I'M DOLLARS IT'S ONE TIME IT'S FOR. THAT SECOND PHASE OF THEIR TESTING AND HOPEFULLY THIS WILL BE THE TO BE RUN IN. THE END OF THIS YEAR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN IN THE FALL HOPEFULLY SO THAT WE COULD HAVE A REALLY GOOD ROBUST TWO THOUSAND NINETEEN. SURVEY WITH THE INFORMATION THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO BE PROVIDED AT THE LOCAL AND. NONCE AT THE LOWER LEVELS OTHER THAN STATE LEVEL SO WE ASK FOR YOUR STRONG SUPPORT. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOURTEEN. ON A HASSLE BUT WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIANS STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL WE WOULD KNOW THAT WITH NINETY SEVEN PERCENT OF CHILDREN. COVERED UNDER HEALTH INSURANCE IN CALIFORNIA IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE KNOW WHAT THAT COVERAGE LOOKS LIKE AND MEANS FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS. AND THAT THE THE DATA THAT WE RECEIVE FROM THIS KIND OF SURVEY UP ALLOWS US TO MAKE GOOD POLICY DECISIONS HERE IN THIS BUILDING THANK YOU THINK MEN. MICHAEL DAY WITH CHILDREN NOW IN STRONG SUPPORT I JUST WANT TO EMPHASIZE HOW IMPORTANT IT IS STATE IS TO REALLY UNDERSTANDING CHILDREN'S HEALTH AND THEIR COVERAGE. ARMS OF THINGS LIKE ASTHMA WE WOULDN'T KNOW AT ADD MORE GRANULAR LEVEL BESIDE THE STATE LEVEL WITHOUT THE STATE THANK YOU. MICHELLE SOBRE VENTS HIS CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND CALIFORNIA IN STRONG SUPPORT THE COMMAND. KATIE LADEN CHILDREN SPECIALTY CARE COALITION OFTEN SUPPORT. COMMAND. LUCY QUESTIONED OLIVER MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH ACCESS IN SUPPORT RECOMEND. SINGLE FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FOURTEEN I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS WE HAVE. JUST WILL SAY THIS IS WELL RECEIVED IN THE PART OF WORKING WITH YOU HERE SHORTLY. ISSUE FOURTEEN WILL BE HELD OPEN AS WE MOVE ON TO ISSUE FIFTEEN. GOOD EVENING CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AND MY NAME IS PAULA WILL HOME I'M A SENIOR POLICY ANALYST REPRESENTING THAT COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT THIS PROPOSAL TO EXPAND THE MEDI CAL ALCOHOL SCREENING BENEFIT TO INCLUDE SCREENING FOR OPIATES AND OTHER ILLICIT DRUGS. SO AS I KNOW YOU'RE ALL WELL AWARE WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OPIATE CRISIS THAT CLAIMED THE LIVES OF MORE THAN TWO THOUSAND CALIFORNIANS AND TWENTY SIXTEEN. AND TO FULLY CONFRONT THIS CRISIS ONE OF THE THINGS WE NEED TO DO IS IDENTIFY MORE PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE WHO ARE MISUSING OPIOIDS AND CONNECT THEM TO TREATMENT. EXPANDING DRUG SCREENING IN MEDI CAL PRIMARY CARE IS A LOW COST BUT POTENTIALLY HIGH IMPACT STRATEGY THAT CAN HELP MORE PEOPLE ACCESS LIFESAVING CARE FOR THEIR SUBSTANCE USE. AND TO BRIEFLY SUMMARIZE WHAT WOULD CHANGE UNDER THIS PROPOSAL AND MEDI CAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS AT PRESENT. CAN SCREEN ADULT BENEFICIARIES FOR A RANGE OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH NEEDS INCLUDING ALCOHOL MISUSE AND IF A CLIENT REPORTS ALCOHOL MISUSE THE PRIMARY CARE PROVIDER CAN BE REIMBURSED FOR ADMINISTERING ADDITIONAL SCREENING TO ASSESS ALCOHOL USE. AND FOR CONDUCTING A BRIEF COUNSELING OR EDUCATION SESSION AND THEN REFERRING THE PERSON TO TREATMENT AS NEEDED. RIGHT NOW PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS OR A MEDICAID MANAGED CARE PLANS COULD CHOOSE TO SCREEN CLIENTS FOR ILLICIT DRUG USE TIME BUT IF A CLIENT WERE TO DISCLOSE DRUG MISUSE THE PRIDE PROVIDER CANNOT RECEIVE MEDICAL REIMBURSEMENT FOR ANY FURTHER TIME THEY SPEND. WITH THAT PERSON ADDRESSING THEIR DRUG USE SO UNFORTUNATELY THERE'S A FINANCIAL DISINCENTIVE TO I'M OFFER THE SCREENING IN THIS CARE. SO UNDER THIS PROPOSAL. A MEDICAL PRIMARY CARE PROVIDERS WOULD CONDUCT ROUTINE DRUG SCREENING ALONGSIDE THE ALCOHOL SCREENING THAT THEY'RE ALREADY OFFERINGAND THEY COULD THEN RECEIVE REIMBURSEMENT FOR THE EDUCATION COUNSELING AND REFERRALS THAT THEY DELIVER FOR DRUG MISUSE. AND IDEALLY THIS JAMES WELL AND SO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE WHO ARE SUCCESSFULLY REFERRED FROM PRIMARY CARE TWO SPECIALTIES SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. AND ON AT THAT AND DO YOU SEE US HAS ESTIMATED THAT THIS EXPANDED SCREENING FOR THE ADULT MEDICAL POPULATION WOULD COST ABOUT EIGHT POINT FOUR MILLION ANNUALLY. BUT THAT'S ACTUALLY ONLY TWO POINT FIVE EIGHT MILLION IN STATE GENERAL FUNDS THAT WOULD BE USED TO DRIVE DOWN FIVE POINT EIGHT MILLION IN FEDERAL FINANCIAL PARTICIPATION UNDER MEDICAID. SO WE WOULD UNDERSCORE THAT THIS IS A RELATIVELY LOW COST INTERVENTION IT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED USING EXISTING PROCEDURES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. AND IT HAS A GREAT POTENTIAL TO SAVE LIVES AND I'M AND EVEN SAVE MONEY. TO THE EXTENT THAT EXPANDED SCREENING WILL HELP MORE PEOPLE ACCESS TREATMENT AND COST BENEFIT ANALYSES HAVE REPEATEDLY SHOWN THAT AS YOU DO TREATMENT. CAN REDUCE EXPENDITURES ON OTHER HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND ON DRUG RELATED CRIMINAL JUSTICE COSTS. AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS MODEL OF SCREENING BRIEF INTERVENTION AND REFERRAL TO TREATMENT. IS ASSOCIATED WITH AND REDUCTIONS IN A PERSON SUBSTANCE USE OVER TIME. SO TO CONCLUDE EXPANDING DRUG SCREENING IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS IS JUST ONE MORE CRITICAL TO ALL THAT WE CAN ADD TO OUR TOOLBOX TO ADDRESS THE OPIATE CRISIS. A A NUMBER OF OTHER STATES INCLUDING OUR NORTHERN NEIGHBOR OR AGAIN ANDS AND THE VERY POPULOUS NEW YORK STATE ARE ALREADY OFFERING. ROUTINE DRUG SCREENING TO ALL MEDICAID BENEFICIARIES AND CALIFORNIA'S SHOULD BE DOING THIS AS WELL SO. AND WE REALLY COMMEND THE STAY IN THE LEGISLATURE FOR A NUMBER OF OTHER INITIATIVES WE'VE COLLECTIVELY UNDERTAKEN TO ADDRESS THE OPIATE CRISIS. WE REALLY HOPE YOU'LL APPROPRIATE THESE FUNDS TO IMPROVE SCREENING AND REFERRALS AS WELL. THANK YOU MA'AM. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE FIFTEEN. SEEING NOT ALL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. I'D FEEL INCLINED TO ASK WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IN YOUR SCENARIO WITH THE PRIMARY CARE DOCTOR WHO. HAD A PATIENT WHO DID ADMIT TO SUBSTANCE USE. WHAT RECOURSE IS TO THEY CURRENTLY HAVE AND WHAT HAPPENS TO THOSE PATIENTS YEAH? I'M. SO YOU KNOW THE IDEAS THAT THEY WERE COULD DO THE SAME THING FOR A CLIENT TO DISCLOSE A SUBSTANCE USE AS THEY DO FOR ALCOHOL USE WHICH IS OFFER THEM. KIND OF ADDITIONAL SCREENING TO ASSESS THE PROBLEM AND THEN CONDUCT A BRIEF INTERVENTION WHICH IS YOU KNOW COUNSELING OR EDUCATION DEPENDING ON AND. THE NATURE OF THE USE THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND AND CULMINATING IN A REFERRAL TO TREATMENT. AND AND THE KICKER NOW IS THAT IF THEY DO THIS THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE REIMBURSED AND IF IT'S DRUG USE RATHER THAN ALCOHOL THEY'RE NOT GONNA BE REIMBURSED FOR THAT THROUGH ON MEDI CAL SO THEY. YOU KNOW WE BELIEVE SOME PEOPLE ARE DOING IT BUT THEY'RE COVERING THOSE COSTS IN ANOTHER WAY. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE FIFTEEN OPEN AND THANK YOU FOR. THINKING OF. ISSUE SIXTEEN. PLEADING CHAIRMAN ARAMBULA AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE MY NAME IS SAM HOLLISTER AND I'M EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR VISION TO LEARNING. REASON TO LEARN ISN'T MOBILE A NONPROFIT MOBILE VISION PROVIDER WE CURRENTLY HAVE ELEVEN MOBILE VISION CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA THAT PROVIDE FREE EXAMS IN CLASSES TO KIDS IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES. VISION TO LEARN WAS FOUNDED SIX YEARS AGO WHERE PUBLIC PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP AND WE'VE PROVIDED OVER NINETY SIX THOUSAND AYE EXAMS AND SEVENTY SIX THOUSAND PAIRS OF GLASSES THE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS. IN K. THROUGH TWELVE IN THREE THOUSAND SCHOOLS IN CALIFORNIA. SEVENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND THIRTY FIVE OF THOSE EXAMS AND FIFTY EIGHT THOUSAND AND TWENTY ONE OF THOSE PAIRS OF GLASSES HAVE BEEN THE KIDS IN LA COUNTY. VISION TO LEARN DOCTORS AND CLINICS GO WHERE KIDS ARE ALL DAY EVERY DAY. AT SCHOOLS WE HELP EVERY CHILD REGARDLESS OF CITIZENSHIP OR INSURANCE STATUS. ACCORDING TO A JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH STUDY NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF FIRST GRADERS IN CALIFORNIA IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES DON'T HAVE THE CLASSES THEY NEED TO SEE THE BORG. OUR OWN SAMPLE OF OVER NINETY THOUSAND SIX THOUSAND KIDS IN THE STATE HAS FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF THEM WHO GOT CLASSES FROM VISION AND LEARN. NEVER HAD GLASSES BEFORE. ANOTHER TWENTY THREE PERCENT OF THOSE CHILDREN HAD CLASSES WITH INCORRECT PRESCRIPTION. IN OTHER WORDS EIGHTY NINE PERCENT OF THE STUDENTS THAT WE PROVIDE THE GLASSES TO DID NOT HAVE A WORKING PARENT CLASSES. A UCLA MATTEL CHILDREN'S HOSPITAL STUDY OF LA UNIFIED SCHOOL KIDS HELP BY VISION TO LEARN. SHOWED THAT GRADES IMPROVED IN JUST A YEAR IN FACT AMONG THIRD GRADE BOYS MATH SCORES WENT UP NEARLY TEN PERCENT. THAT SEEMS STUDY FOUND THAT NINETY POOP PERCENT OF TEACHERS FELT THAT MOST CHILDREN IN THEIR SCHOOLS WOULD HAVE NOT HAD ACCESS TO CLASSES WITHOUT VISION TO LEARN. VISION TO LEARN SIR CURRENTLY SERVES LA COUNTY THE EIGHT BAY AREA COUNTIES IN SACRAMENTO. THIS APPROPRIATION WILL ALLOW US TO EXPAND OUR SERVICES NAY STATEWIDE WHILE THE DEPARTMENT CONTINUES TO WORK WITH US TO IDENTIFY A LONG TERM OPTION FOR MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT. THE DEPARTMENT IS CURRENTLY LEANING TOWARDS THE ALLEY A FUNDING BACK IS AN ISM AS A SOLUTION AND WE ARE OPENING WE ARE OPEN TO UNDERSTANDING THAT OPTION. IT'S NOT ONE WE KNOW SINCE AND OTHER STATE THREE SEWER WE SERVE REESE RECEIVE MEDICAID REIMBURSEMENT WE UNDERSTAND THAT CALIFORNIA'S MORE COMPLEX AND WE TRULY APPRECIATE THE DEPARTMENT'S EFFORTS IN THIS AREA. THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SIXTEEN. BUT IT ONE REPRESENT CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES ORGANIZATION. OSCAR WINNERS EVER WORKED VERY CLOSELY WITH VISION TO LEARN AND IN MANY CASES IF IT WERE NOT FOR THEM TO BE THERE TO DO THE FOLLOW UP SCREENING. AND TO PROVIDE THE GLASSES MOSQUE CHILDREN WOULD GO WITHOUT. THANK YOU MA'AM. FEEL PALE SERBS AND HEALTH NET. WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH VISION LEARN DOWN IN THE LA COUNTY PILOT AREA VERY HAPPY WITH THE RESULTS WE THINK OVERALL. IT'S BEEN GOOD NOT ONLY FOR THE PLAN BUT FOR SCHOOL CHILDREN OF ALL AGES. ABLE TO AVAIL THEMSELVES OF THE SERVICES OF VISION TO LEARN FOR THOSE REASONS WE SUPPORT THANK YOU. SIR. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT FOR ISSUE SIXTEEN OR BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS ASSEMBLY MEMBER MATHIS. EACH ONE OF THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD. I I HAVE A. YOUNG ONE WHO IS STRUGGLING WITH READING AT HOME AND WE COULDN'T FIGURE OUT WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THEM OTHER THAN HIS NICKNAME IS MOOSE. ARE IT IT. A AND FINALLY DAD WENT IN TO GET HIS. AYE AYE ONE IN TO GIVE MY READERS. AND WE GOT HIM TESTED AS WELL AND FOUND IT OUT THAT HE NEEDED GLASSES TO USE. HIS HIS READING WHAT FROM WAY BEHIND GRADE LEVELS OF THREES FINALLY CAUGHT UP SO IT IT'S PROGRAMS LIKE THIS TO MAKE IT HAPPEN FOR EVERYBODY SO THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISS HOLLISTER FOR BRINGING THIS VERY. WELL THOUGHT OUT PROPOSAL FORWARD AND. LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING OUR CONVERSATIONS WITH THAT WILL HOLD ISSUE SIXTEEN OPEN. AND WANT ISSUE SEVENTEEN. HI I'M HELEN ROTH SELDON AYE WITH TEACHERS FOR HEALTHY KIDS. AND AND I HAVE SOME MUSIC TEARS THIS IS A NO COST ITEM. SO WHAT THIS IS IS IT'S A IT'S A LANGUAGE REQUEST AND WE HAVE ANOTHER PROPOSAL THAT'S IN THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE WHICH IS FOR START UP FUNDS IT'S GOING TO BE HEARD. SO WHAT THIS WOULD DO IS THAT WOULD ALLOW SCHOOL DISTRICTS TO TRANSFER AYE CAPTAIN OUT ANNUALLY A FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. WHICH IS THREE TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT OF THE AMOUNT THAT THEY RECEIVED BACK FOR UP FROM FEDERAL REIMBURSEMENT WHICH IS AROUND A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION FOR THE LAST YEAR BUT IT'S BEEN GOING UP. THEY RECEIVE BACK FOR HEALTH SERVICES THAT ARE PROVIDED IN THE SCHOOLS THROUGH THE ALLEY A BILLING OPTION PROGRAM. SO THE PA COST PER SCHOOL DISTRICT IS NINE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE DOLLARS. THERE'S RIGHT NOW THERE'S NO CENTRAL LOCATION WITHIN THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION FOR SCHOOL BASED SERVICES. AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALMOST EVERY STATE THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO TALK TO ACT PASSED SO CALIFORNIA'S REALLY BEHIND IN THIS. I'M THERE ARE SINCE THESE FUNDS ARE ACTUALLY IN STATUTE IN WHAT I PASSED OUT HAS A COPY OF THE LANGUAGE. A YOU HAVE TO CHANGE THE STATUTE TO ALLOW THIS FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AND TO SET UP THE TRANSFER MECHANISM. TO THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WHICH IS WHAT THE LANGUAGE DOES. AND I'M THE OTHER SUBCOMMITTEE WILL BE HEARING THE ITEM OR I THINK HAS ALREADY AGREED ON TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND AND ONE TIME FUNDS. THAT FOR THIS YEAR TO GET IT STARTED WITH THIS IS ONGOING AND THERE WILL BE OTHER FUNDS THAT WOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO GO TO THIS OFFICE. SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE WILLING TO UNDERWRITE THIS. IT'S NOT GENERAL FUND AND WE JUST NEED THE MECHANISM FOR THE TRANSFER. OTHERWISE CD WOULD HAVE TO INVOICE ALL OF THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS FIVE HUNDRED AND THIRTY SIX SCHOOL DISTRICTS. FOUR NINE HUNDRED THIRTY THREE DOLLARS APIECE AND THAT SEEMS TO BE A REALLY INEFFICIENT WAY TO MAKE THIS HAPPEN INSTEAD A DIRECT TRANSFER BETWEEN THE DEPARTMENTS SEEMS TO BE THE BETTER AVENUE. AND SO WE WOULD ASK UP FOR YOU TO PUT THIS IS PART OF YOUR PROPOSAL THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE SEVENTEENTH. AB ONE REPRESENTING OUR CALIFORNIA SCHOOL NURSES AND WE ARE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE SENATE ADMINISTRATIVE APPROACH TO THE LA BILLING PROGRAM. I THINK YOU MAY BE AWARE THAT TO A RECENTLY CMS ARE ESSENTIALLY REMOVE THE FREE CARE RULE. AND BECAUSE OF THAT NOW THEY WILL BE A HUGE INCREASE IN TERMS OF. ARE. CHILDREN WHO WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE SERVICES AS WELL AS A LARGE NUMBER OF. EXTRA PROVIDERS WHO WILL PROVIDE THE SERVICES AND MOST IMPORTANTLY THE LA A REIMBURSEMENT WELL. WE BELIEVE EXPAND IN TERMS OF COMING BACK TO CALIFORNIA. ARE IN THE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN SIXTEEN ONLY A REPORT. IT SHOW THAT OVER FIVE HUNRED LAUP ARE PROVIDERS BOB WE HAVE IN PAST YEARS HAD ALL AT LEAST SEVEN HUNDRED OR SO. HOWEVER FIFTY PERCENT OF OUR KIDS ARE MET ON MELTED MEDICO AND WE HAVE OVER A THOUSAND SCHOOL DISTRICTS SO WE'RE EXPECTING TO SEE ARE. A HUGE INCREASE. WITH THE OFFICE IN THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION WORKING COLLABORATIVELY AND COOPERATIVELY WITH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. WE EXPECT TO SEE NOT ONLY INCREASING REIMBURSEMENT INCREASING PROVIDERS BUT ALSO MORE SERVICES PROVIDED TO US STUDENTS. SO WE THINK THAT THIS IS A VERY CRITICAL ISSUE THAT NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED AT THIS POINT IN ORDER TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXPANSION OF LA A BUILDING PROGRAM. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR TONY TOOK CARE ON BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA TEACHERS ASSOCIATION. THIS IS. IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT THERE BE A BETTER COLOR COLLABORATION BETWEEN THE. RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN CD  <u><c.green>IN THE</c></u> DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES IN CHILDREN'S HEALTH IS AT STAKE. THE LACK OF IT MO YOU BETWEEN THE TWO AGENCIES AND THE ABSENCE OF REGULAR AN ON GOING STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS IS DETRIMENTAL TO THE. TO THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES AND TO THE AND TO TEACHERS WHO KNOW THAT A HEALTHY THAT HELP A CHILD IS DIRECTLY REALLY RELATED TO THEIR ABILITY TO LEARN. THIS IS A SMALL AMOUNT OF MONEY WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT AND POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR STUDENTS AS MANY PERCENT PER PREVIOUS PRESENTERS HAVE STATED BEFORE ME. M. PREVENTION IS LESS EXPENSIVE THAN A REACTION AFTER THE FACT PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO SCHOOL DISTRICTS BEFORE THERE ARE PROBLEMS NOT AFTER IS COST EFFECTIVE AND A POSITIVE USE OF THESE RESOURCES WE SINCERELY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. BECAME. ON A HAS SUPPLIED WITH UNITED WAYS OF CALIFORNIA AND ALSO ON BEHALF OF THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND OF CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL WE BELIEVE THIS IS A SMART GUY INVESTMENT IN WHAT WE KNOW. WORKS FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES THANK YOU THANK YOU MA'AM. EVERYBODY HAVE A STATE SUPERINTENDENT OF PUBLIC INSTRUCTION TOM PARKS AND WE THINK THE M. THAT NURSES IN THE TEACHERS AND AND SCHOOL DISTRICTS AND OTHER. ADVOCATES WERE REALLY I'M HELPING PATIENTS PROPOSAL THAT'S WHAT ALLOW THE AT DEPARTMENT TO BUILD GREATER CAPACITY WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT TO HAVE A BETTER PARTNERSHIP WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. SO THAT WE CAN HELP SUPPORT ELEAZAR AS THEY TRY TO EXPAND HEALTHCARE ACCESS SO IT REALLY ALLOW HAS. TO BE AT A BETTER SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR DISTRICTS THAT THEY COULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A BETTER HEALTH CARE SERVICES ON SCHOOLS AND GET MORE HEALTHCARE SERVICES TO TO STUDENTS AND CHILDREN THANK. AND COMMEND. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE SEVENTEEN I'LL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. ASSEMBLYMEMBER MATHIS. THIS IS A GRAVE BOZANICH ONE OF THE THINGS WE COMPLAIN ABOUT THE MOST IS THAT THE. DIFFERENT AGENCIES DON'T TALK. IT'S GREAT TO HAVE TOM SUPPORT AS WELL SNOW. THANK YOU. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE SEVENTEEN OPEN. THANK YOU AND TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE A TEN PITY HER WITH THE OFFICE OF STATEWIDE HEALTH PLANNING AND DEVELOPMENT ALSO KNOWN AS SUCH THAT. HOSPITALS RESPONSIBLE FOR PLANNING AND PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT TO ADVANCE CALIFORNIANS ACCESS TO SAFE QUALITY HEALTHCARE. OUR WORK IS FOCUSED IN THREE PRIMARY AREAS. FIRST HEALTH CARE FACILITY CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCE SECOND HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AND THIRD HEALTHCARE DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND REPORTING. ASPECTS PROPOSED BUDGET FOR TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS A HUNDRED AND FORTY FIVE MILLION. HOSPITAL'S FUNDED PRIMARILY BY SPECIAL FUNDS MANY OF THEM SUPPORTED. HER BUDGET LOOT THE THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS GENERAL FUND. AND A SMALL AMOUNT OF FEDERAL FUNDING ABOUT ONE POINT FIVE MILLION FOR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS. OUR FIRST PROGRAM AREA IS HEALTH CARE CONSTRUCTION AND FINANCING. WHERE THE BUILDING DEPARTMENT FOR CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITALS AND SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES? OUR TECHNICAL STAFF REVIEW AND APPROVE DESIGN PLANS FOR NEW CONSTRUCTION AND UPGRADES OF FACILITIES. HOSPITAL ADMINISTERS THE SEISMIC SAFETY PROGRAM WHICH IS FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITAL BUILDINGS SO THEY CAN REMAIN STANDING AND OPERATIONAL. IN THE EVENT OF AN EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER DISASTER. TWENTY THOUSAND ONE FORTY PERCENT OF CALIFORNIA'S HOSPITAL BUILDING INVENTORY WAS CLASSIFIED. AS BEING AT RISK OF COLLAPSE IN A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE. THIS REPRESENTED OVER ONE THOUSAND BUILDINGS TODAY IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETY FOUR PERCENT. CUTE CARE HOSPITAL BUILDINGS IN THE STATE NOW COMPLY WITH THE SEISMIC SAFETY ACTS TWENTY TWENTY STANDARDS. US BUT HAS ALSO PROMULGATED A NEW SEISMIC PERFORMANCE CATEGORY. CALLED SBC FORTY. THAT WILL ALLOW OLDER HOSPITAL BUILDINGS TO UPGRADE TO A STANDARD. THAT WILL KEEP THEM SEISMICALLY COMPLIANT PASSED THE TWENTY THIRTY DEADLINE. TO DATE FORTY TWO HOSPITAL BUILDINGS IN TWENTY TWO HOSPITALS HAVE APPLIED FOR S. B. C. FORTY UPGRADES. THIS IS AN EXCELLENT OPTION PARTICULARLY FOR HOSPITALS AND AREAS OF LOW SEISMICITY. THAT WOULD OTHERWISE HAVE TO BE REPLACED OR REMOVED FROM ACUTE CARE SERVICES. US BUT CONTINUES TO LOOK FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE OUR SERVICE DELIVERY. AND ENSURE CONSTRUCTION PLANS ARE APPROVED TIMELY AND EFFICIENTLY. IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NINETY FIVE PERCENT OF ALL PROJECT APPLICATIONS TOSSED BED. WERE SUBMITTED ELECTRONICALLY INTO A HARSH PEDS E. SERVICES PORTAL. ALSO IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN NINETY SEVEN PERCENT A PROJECT REVIEWS WERE COMPLETED ON SCHEDULE. IN THE AREA OF HEALTHCARE FINANCING ASPECT ADMINISTERS THE CAL MORTGAGE PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES CALIFORNIA'S NONPROFIT AND PUBLIC HEALTH FACILITIES. ACCESS TO LOW COST FINANCING FOR THEIR CAPITAL CONSTRUCTION NEEDS BY OFFERING LOAN INSURANCE SINCE TWO THOUSAND THIRTEEN. CAL MORTGAGE HAS ENSURED FORTY SIX LOANS TOTALING OVER ONE POINT FOUR BILLION. FOR THESE FACILITIES AT NO COST TO THE GENERAL FUND. OUR NEXT MAJOR PROGRAM AREA IS HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. AJ BUT HAS TO ORGANIZATIONS RESPONSIBLE FOR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. THE FIRST IS OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT DIVISION IN THE SECOND IS OUR HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION. OUR HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INCREASED ACCESS TO HEALTHCARE FOR UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES AND POPULATIONS BY PROMOTING A DIVERSE. AND CULTURALLY COMPETENT HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. THEY FOCUS ON RECRUITING AND RETAINING VARIOUS HEALTH PROFESSIONALS AND AREAS OF UNMET NEED. THE INCREASE THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF CALIFORNIA'S HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE. AND EXPLORE NEW SERVICE DELIVERY MODELS THREE PILOT PROJECTS. ONE OF OUR PRIMARY HEALTHCARE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS IS THE FONG BROWN PROGRAM. SONG BROWN ADMINISTERS GRANTS TO PRIMARY CARE TEACHING AND RESIDENCY PROGRAMS TO ADDRESS THE MEL DISTRIBUTION OF PROVIDERS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE ENCOURAGE UNDERREPRESENTED GROUPS TO PURSUE HEALTHCARE CAREERS. THE BUDGET ACT OF TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN INCLUDED A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION OF A HUNDRED MILLION GENERAL FUND TO BE DISTRIBUTED OVER A THREE YEAR PERIOD. PORT PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCIES IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. I SHOULD RECEIVE THE FIRST THIRTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION APPROPRIATION IN THE CURRENT YEAR. DURING THE TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN SONG BROWN PRIMARY CARE RESIDENCIA WORD CYCLE APPROXIMATELY TWENTY SEVEN MILLION GENERAL FUND WAS AWARDED. THE STATE HAS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE YEARS TO SPEND THE REMAINING MONEY. THE PROPOSED TWO THOUSAND EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET INCLUDES THE SECOND INSTALLMENT OF THIRTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION. THE HEALTH PROFESSIONS EDUCATION FOUNDATION IS A NONPROFIT FIVE BUT ONCE THREE HOUSE WITH AN AWESOME HEAD. THIS FOUNDATION ADMINISTERS THIRTEEN LOAN REPAYMENT AND SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAMS. THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL INCENTIVES TO HEALTH PROFESSIONALS IN EXCHANGE FOR SERVICE OBLIGATION. IN MEDICALLY UNDERSERVED AREAS.

TOTALING ALMOST ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY MILLION TO CALIFORNIA HEALTH PROFESSIONALS SERVING IN AREAS OF UNMET NEED IN ALL FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ACROSS THE STATE. OUR THIRD PROGRAM AREA IS HEALTHCARE DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING. ASPECTS INFORMATION SERVICES DIVISION SERVICES THE HEALTH CARE DATA COLLECTION AND REPORTING HOT.

THIS DATA INCLUDES HOSPITAL PATIENT RECORDS AS WELL AS PUBLIC AGGREGATE UTILIZATION AND FINANCIAL DATA. WE PRODUCE MEASURES ANALYSES AND REPORTS ON HEALTH CARE OUTCOMES AND QUALITY. AND OTHER RELATED HEALTH TOPICS. WE MAKE MUCH OF OUR DATA AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC RESEARCHERS POLICYMAKERS THE MEDIA AND OTHERS. WE ALSO PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO VARIOUS STAKEHOLDERS AND MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. SEEKING TO USE POSH BUT DATA AND WE CAN PRODUCE CUSTOMIZED DATA SETS OR ANALYSES UPON REQUEST. MUCH OF IT IS CURRENTLY IMPLEMENTING A NEW PROGRAM IN OUR DATA AREA PURSUANT TO SENATE BILL SEVENTEEN. WHICH WAS ENACTED LAST FALL. S. B. SEVENTEEN ESTABLISHEDA NEW DATA REPORTING PROGRAM. WHICH SEEKS TO INCREASE PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS TRANSPARENCY. BY REQUIRING ADVANCE NOTIFICATION OF SPECIFIED PRICE INCREASES THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS ME STOP YOU THERE GUESTS THAT'S ISSUE NINETEEN OF YEAH I'M GOING OUT SO. I'M WILL STOP NOW WITH ISSUE EIGHTEEN AND THAT'S DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE LA NO ANY COMMENTS. ANY PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE EIGHTEEN. SEEING NONE. WE WILL HOLD ISSUE EIGHTEEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NINETEEN. HIGHER SCOTT CHRISTMANN A W. DIRECTOR AND CHIEF INFORMATION OFFICER WITH THE OFF STATEWIDE OPENING DEVELOPMENT US BUT. WITH THE BUDGET PROPOSAL FOR S. B. SEVENTEEN. FOR A S. B. SEVENTEEN REPRESENTS SO WHAT THE NEW DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM FOR. FROSH BID. PROMOTING BECAUSE TRANSPARENCY OF FOR BOTH PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS. DRUGS IN CALIFORNIA. GOOD AS REQUIRED BY LAW OF THIS FOUR OSCARS ACTUALLY MADE AVAILABLE REGISTRY OF PUBLIC AND PRIVATE PURCHASERS FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADVANCE NOTIFICATION. OF FOR MANUFACTURERS AS OF JANUARY ONE THIS YEAR A DRUG MANUFACTURERS ARE REQUIRED TO NOTIFY REGISTERED PURCHASERS OF SPECIFIED THAT INCREASES IN THE WHOLESALE ACQUISITION COST. OF A PRESCRIPTION DRUG. IT'S NOT PRESENT WE CONTINUE TO WORK ON REGULATIONS DEVELOPMENT. FOCUSING SPECIFICALLY ON STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT AS OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL INDUSTRY IS A NEW. OF GROUP STAKEHOLDERS AT AS AS YOU MIGHT BE AWARE AUSTIN HAS FOCUSED MOSTLY. ON HEALTH OF HOSPITALS AND HEALTHCARE. FACILITIES WITH IT'S A CURRENT DATA COLLECTION PROGRAM SO. WE'VE ACTUALLY CONDUCTED TO PUBLIC WORKSHOPS NOT IN THE LAST TWO MONTHS ONE IN MARCH FOCUSED ON DATA USERS AND THESE WOULD BE ESSENTIALLY PURCHASERS. OF INCLUDING STATE PURCHASERS OF ALL HEALTH PLANS OF AS WELL AS PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS. OTHER WE FOLLOWED IN APRIL OR WITH THE SECOND PUBLIC WORKSHOP IN THIS IS FOCUSED ON DATA SUBMITTERS AND THIS WOULD BE THE MANUFACTURERS THEMSELVES. THAT ARE WE REQUIRED TO TO OF SUBMIT THIS BUDGET OF COST INCREASE THOUGHT INFORMATION STARTING AND. TWENTY NINETEEN. ALTHOUGH BOTH WORKSHOPS WERE VERY WELL ATTENDED. BUT WE WE WE WE TOOK A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF FEEDBACK BOTH AT THE WORKSHOPS AND THEN YOU KNOW IN WRITTEN. SUBMISSIONS AFTER WE'VE WE'VE BEEN ESSENTIALLY COMPILING THAT. AT PRESENT. TO TO INCORPORATE INTO THE DRAFT REGULATIONS. ALRIGHT NOW WE'RE WE'RE TARGETING A OF A FORMAL SUBMISSION. OF THE. REGULATIONS FOR S. B. SEVENTEEN IN JULY. TO BEGIN THE THE THE RULE MAKING PROCESS THOUGHT AND TO HAVE THOSE OF A ADOPTED BY JANUARY ONE. OF TWENTY NINETEEN. TO BEGIN ESSENTIALLY THE THE OF DATA COLLECTION OF BOTH. A NEW PRESCRIPTION DRUGS WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY WILL WILL PROVIDE A SET OF DATA ELEMENTS. TO TO WASH BUT FROM EACH MANUFACTURER OF BASED ON A. THRESHOLD AMOUNT SET THE LAW. MEDICARE SPECIALTY RIGHT OUT SIX SEVENTY. AND THEN OF COURSE THE ON GOING. INCREASES THAT REACH THE SPECIFIED THRESHOLD WHICH IS THAT IT SIXTEEN PERCENT OVER. PRIOR TO YEARS AND AND AND KILL IT SO. THAT WE BEEN. YOU KNOW. WORKING DILIGENTLY AT AT AT THAT PACKAGE IN AND THEN LIKEWISE RAMPING UP OUR EFFORTS FOR THE. TECHNOLOGY. REQUIRED TO COLLECT THOSE WHICH WERE LEVERAGING BASED OFF EXISTING OF HEALTH CARE OF THE DATA COLLECTION PROGRAMS. SOME IN THE PROPOSAL SPECIFICALLY WERE REQUESTING THREE POSITIONS OF IN FISCAL YEAR EIGHTEEN NINETEEN. ARE IN THIS IS TO DEVELOP REGULATIONS SYSTEMS PROPHECIES OF FOR COLLECTION REVIEW. AND PUBLICATION. OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG COST INFORMATION OF BEGINNING IN NEXT CALENDAR YEAR THERE'S RESOURCES ALSO BE USED TO DEVELOP A PENALTY APPEALS PROCESS AS AS IDENTIFIED IN THE LAW. YES SIR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE ILIO. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATTER GET SICK OF ON THE PART OF FINANCE WE AGREE WITH THIS PROPOSAL IT'S RESPONSIVE TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF S. B. SEVENTEEN. THE COMMAND. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE NINETEEN. GOOD EVENING MEMBERS AM MARY VALDEZ OF HEALTHAXIS CALIFORNIA WE WERE A PROUD CO SPONSOR OF S. B. SEVENTEEN. TO HELP INCREASE COST TRANSPARENCY IN PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND WE WANT TO THANK GOSH PAD ON THE. VERY. COLLABORATIVE IMPLEMENTATION PROCESS WE'VE BEEN VERY PLEASED WITH THE WORKSHOPS AND LOOK FORWARD TO I'M WORKING WITH YOU AS IMPLEMENTATION LOOKS FORWARD. AND ALSO I SUPPORT THE BCP THINKING. WE GIVE THEM. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE NINETEEN. SAY NO COMMENTS FROM THE DYESS WILL HOLD ISSUE NINETEEN OPEN TO MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY. THANK YOU GOOD EVENING MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS FOR ASKING A WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. WE ARE PLEASED TO SPONSOR THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WOULD PROVIDE CRITICAL SUSTAIN FUNDING OF FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THE CALIFORNIA VECTOR BORNE DISEASE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM OTHERWISE KNOWN AS CAL SERVE. CAL SERVICE A PROGRAM THAT IS JOINTLY MANAGED BY UC DAVIS THE MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL ASSOCIATION THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. IT PROVIDES CENTRALIZED DATA COLLECTION ANALYSIS AND STORAGE RELATED THE PRESENCE OF MOSQUITOES AND MOSQUITO BORNE DISEASES AROUND THE STATE. IT ALSO PROVIDES LOCAL MOSQUITO CONTROL AGENCIES WITH REAL TIME INFORMATION ON WHERE MOSQUITOES MIGHT EMERGE THAT VACANT BEST COMBAT THEIR SPREAD. THE STATE HAS SUPPORTED MOSQUITO RESEARCH IN THE PAST FROM NINETEEN SEVENTY TWO TO TWO THOUSAND EIGHT. WHEN THAT FUNDING WAS ABSORBED DURING THE MANY CUTS FOR THE RECESSION. WE'VE BEEN OUT WITHOUT SUPPORT SINCE THEN AND THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE NOW BEING THAT WERE FACING NEW NON NATIVE SPECIES OF MOSQUITOES THAT TRANSMIT THE ZECA VIRUS DENGUE CHIKUNGUNYA AND YELLOW FEVER. THIS IS IN ADDITION THE WORK THAT OUR MEMBER AGENCIES STILL DO IN PROTECTING AGAINST WEST NILE VIRUS WHICH IS STILL PRESENT IN CALIFORNIA AND DEVASTATING TO THOSE WHO ARE AFFECTED EVERY YEAR. WEST NILE CONTINUES TO BE COSTLY TO TREAT WITH AN ESTIMATED ECONOMIC IMPACT OF OVER EIGHTEEN THOUSAND DOLLARS PER HUMAN CASE ANNUALLY. AND A SORRY AND THAT'S PER HUMAN CASE OVER THE COURSE OF THAT CASE PERIOD. I IN SMALLER NORTHERN COUNTIES LAKE VIEW YOU BEEN COLUSA THAT HAVE A HIGHER INCIDENCE OF WEST NILE AND THE SMALL HEALTH CARE BUDGETS THOSE COSTS ARE PRETTY SIGNIFICANT. BEING ABLE TO TRACK DISEASE TRANSMITTING MOSQUITOES AND VIRUS INFECTION RISK IS A KEY COMPONENT PREVENTING DISEASE OUTBREAKS AND CONTROLLING MOSQUITO POPULATIONS. THE CULTURE OF PROGRAMS OF THE MOST CUTTING EDGE SYSTEMS AVAILABLE TO DO THIS. INVASIVE MOSQUITOES HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN OVER TWO HUNDRED THIRTY CITIES AND LOCALITIES AND TWELVE COUNTIES INCLUDING POPULOUS URBAN AREAS WHERE THE RISK FOR LOCAL TRANSMISSION OF DAN GAINES YOU GO OR NO VERY REAL THREAT. THIS PROPOSAL IS A SMALL INVESTMENT PREVENTION THAT WILL ULTIMATELY SAVE THE STATE MONEY FROM THE COST MOSQUITO BORNE ILLNESSES AND PUT THE STATE ON CUTTING EDGE OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH SUPPORT. WE ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME AND I'D LIKE TO INTRODUCE DR CHRIS PARKER WITH UC DAVIS. HI MY NAME IS CHRIS PARKER AND I'M AN ASSOCIATE PROFESSOR OF EPIDEMIOLOGY UC DAVIS I'M ALSO THE DIRECTOR OF THE PACIFIC SOUTHWEST CENTER OF EXCELLENCE IN VECTOR BORNE DISEASES THAT'S AT UC DAVIS AND UC RIVERSIDE. AND. AYE ALSO OVERSEE THE CALLOUS OR SYSTEM WHICH IS WHY I'M HERE. IN THAT SYSTEM IS HOUSE AT UC DAVIS AND REPRESENTS THE COLLABORATION OF THE NASA HAS DESCRIBED. IN THE INTEREST OF TIME I KNOW IT'S GETTING LATE SO I'LL JUST GIVE YOU A VERY BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE SUCCESSES IN THE OPPORTUNITIES OF BEING ABLE BY SUPPORT OF THE SYSTEM. I'M COUNSELOR BEGAN IN TWO THOUSAND SIX AS AN ONLINE PLATFORM FOR DATA MANAGEMENT REPORTING FOR MOSQUITOES AND THE VIRUSES THEY TRANSMIT AT THE TIME IT WAS PRIMARILY FOCUSED ON WEST NILE VIRUS IN AND MOSQUITOES. RELEVANT TO THAT SYSTEM. ON SINCE THEN WITH ALL OF THE NEW CHALLENGES THAT VANESSA DESCRIBE WE'VE EXPANDED THE SYSTEM'S CAPABILITIES TO I'M ADDRESS ESPECIALLY THE SPREAD OF INVASIVE MOSQUITOES IN OUR CITIES. THE EMERGENCE OF THE GOV IRIS VERY RECENTLY. AS WELL AS THE RETURN OF ST LOUIS ENCEPHALITIS VIRUS HERE WHICH WAS GONE FOR TWELVE YEARS ON. AND RETURNED IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN AND HAS RECURRED EVERY YEAR SENSE. KELSO HAS RECOGNIZED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH AS OUR STATE'S OFFICIAL DATABASE FOR OF THE SURVEILLANCE OF MOSQUITOES IN THE VIRUSES THEY TRANSMIT WHICH I THINK. IS A LARGE PART OF HIS SUCCESS WHEN YOU OF THE OFFICIAL SEAL OF APPROVAL OF THE STATE THAT. THAT REALLY ADVANCES THE USE BY LOCAL AGENCIES. IN ALL OF OUR STAKEHOLDERS ACROSS THE STATE RELY ON A DAILY FOR REPORTING IN DECISION MAKING. TODAY WE'VE REALLY SUPPORTED THE SYSTEM BY LEVERAGING A PATCHWORK OF RESEARCH FUNDING WHICH IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT. ON RESEARCH GRANTS TO JUSTIFY A PROGRAMMER SALARY IT'S GOT TO BE A CERTAIN TYPE OF GRANT THAT DOESN'T ALWAYS SELL A CERTAIN AGENCIES. BUT WE'VE BEEN REASONABLY SUCCESSFUL AT THAT SO FAR. MANY OF THOSE HAVE BEEN FROM FEDERAL SOURCES INCLUDING NO ANNOUNCE AND CDC. I'M AND FOR A BRIEF PERIOD WE ALSO RECEIVE SUPPORT FROM MOSQUITO AND VECTOR CONTROL ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA ON WHICH FOR NASA REPRESENTS. THESE FUNDS OF LEFT OUR STATE IN A GREAT POSITION ON THE SYSTEM'S WELL ESTABLISHED BEEN USED TO SINCE TWO THOUSAND SIX AS I MENTION. WHERE OFTEN HELD UP BY OTHER STATES AND EVEN THE U. S. CDC IS ONE OF THE BEST EXAMPLES OF A FUNCTIONAL PARTNERSHIP? AMONG STAKEHOLDERS IN ACADEMIA WHICH IS US AND THEN PUBLIC HEALTH AND VECTOR CONTROL. SO THEY THEY LOVE US COME A WHAT'S STARTING TO BE RECOGNIZED IS THAT THE SYSTEM'S HANGING BY A THREAD SO TO SPEAK BECAUSE. IT ALWAYS DEPENDS ON THE NEXT GRANT COMING IN AND THAT. REALLY NEEDS A LITTLE BIT MORE STABLE FUNDING. SO DESPITE THE SUCCESSES WE CAN DO A LOT MORE. WERE CONSTANTLY AT RISK OF THE ABS INFLOWS OF FEDERAL FUNDING AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW. SO WE WERE LOOKING FOR MORE STABILITY CALM THE MODEST FEDERAL SUPPORT WE'VE RECEIVED IS SUPPORTED ONLY A SINGLE POSITION AT ANY GIVEN TIME WHICH IS ALSO. PRETTY UNDERPOWERED IN TERMS OF HUMAN RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR GROWING LIST OF NEEDS. EFFECTIVE MOSQUITO CONTROL REALLY DEPENDS ON THE QUALITY OF THE EVIDENCE AVAILABLE TO INFORM THEIR CONTROL DECISIONS SO. ON YOUR SUPPORT WOULD PROVIDE FOR NEW DEVELOPMENT SEVERAL AREAS AND THREE OF THE SPECIFIC ONES THAT I JUST WANT TO MENTION THE INTEREST OF TIME OUR. NEW DATA VISUALIZATION TOOLS THAT ACTUALLY ALLOWS TO DIRECTLY LINK SURVEILLANCE AND CONTROL DATA TO SEE HOW WE'RE DOING REAL TIME. MAPS OF INSECTICIDE RESISTANCE WHICH IS A BEEN A BIG CHALLENGE ACROSS OUR STATE. THAT COULD HELP MOSQUITO CONTROL AGENCIES DECIDE WHICH PRODUCTS ARE WILL BE MOST EFFECTIVE AND THEN ALSO PUBLIC FACING RISK MAPS WHICH GIVES ALL OF US. OF YOU ANYTIME OF LIVE DATA AND THE COUNSELOR SYSTEM AND COULD BE POTENTIALLY TAILORED AND EMBEDDED INTO LOCAL. AGENCIES WEBSITES WHICH GIVES THEM A RESOURCE THAT THEY DON'T YET HAVE. SO EXCITED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM WE FEEL LIKE IT'S IN A GOOD POSITION BUT WE'RE REALLY LOOKING FOR THAT. EXTRA BIT OF STATE SUPPORT TO REALLY KNOW THAT IT WILL EXIST FROM NOW ON AND I THINK THAT'S WHERE WE ARE IS. AS IT'S BEEN INCREASINGLY RELIED ON WE REALLY WANT TO KNOW THAT. THERE IS THAT SUPPORT AND WE WILL HAVE PROGRAMMERS AND OTHERS DEDICATED TO THIS FOR YEARS TO COME. THANK YOU DOCTOR. WE'LL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THE ISSUE TWENTY. SEEN NONO BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS WE MAY HAVE. IN MY PRACTICE I KNOW WE WOULD OFTENTIMES FOLLOW MATCH OF THE WORK YOU DID PARTICULARLY AROUND WEST NILE SO IT'S A. WELL RECEIVED PROPOSAL ON WILL HOLD ISSUE TWENTY OPEN FOR NOW GOOD EVENING AGAIN. I AM STILL DOCTORS WOULD ON COOPER WITH PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES. AND I'M HERE AGAIN TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT DIABETES ON BUT THIS TIME A LITTLE DIFFERENT ON IT WITH A MORE EXPANSIVE VIEW SO. I'M GIVEN WILL BE VERY TALKED ABOUT ABOUT THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM THIS ACTUALLY HELPS TO COUPLE THAT PROGRAM WITH SOME ADDITIONAL FUNDS TO BE ABLE TO DO OUTREACH. AND ENROLLMENT ON ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE KNOW IT IN TERMS OF BARRIERS IS. WE PEOPLE NEED TO KNOW THAT THERE'S ACTUALLY A PROBLEM I MEAN CALIFORNIA FIFTY FIVE PERCENT OF THE POPULATION HAS PRE DIABETES. OP OR DIABETES BUT MANY PEOPLE DON'T KNOW THAT THEY HAVE IT AND THEY ALSO NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE PERSONAL RISK ON IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO THEN MOVE TO THE THIRD STEP WITH IT WHICH IS ACTUALLY REACHING OUT AND ACCESSING RESOURCES AND SO SINCE WE HAD THE DIABETES. PREVENTION PROGRAM THAT'S GOING TO BE WATCHING AND MEDI CAL UP IN JANUARY AS WELL AS ON DIABETES TREATMENT PROGRAMS WE REALLY WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE AWARE OF THE RISK. AND ALSO AWARE OF THE RESOURCES AND SO THIS IS A ONE TIME ALLOCATION OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO BE ABLE TO HIRE TWO FULL TIME STAFF PEOPLE TO HELP WITH AN OUTREACH AND ENROLLMENT. OWE IT INITIATIVE ON THIS WOULD BE A CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD PUBLICIZE THROUGHOUT THE STATE USING VARIOUS FORMS OF MEDIA SO THIS WOULD BE WORKING WITH PROMONTORY THE COMMUNITY HEALTH WORKERS TO BE ABLE TO GET THE WORD OUT. AND AN AREA THAT ALSO AND ENGAGE ON TRADITIONAL MEDIA AND SOCIAL MEDIA AND THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT THERE WOULD BE AN OVERSIGHT AND ADVISORY COMMITTEE THAT WOULD CONVENE AND TOM WOULD. INCLUDE A LOT OF PEOPLE FROM VARIOUS. STAKEHOLDER GROUPS SO YOU WOULD HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE IN MEDIA YOU'D ALSO HAVE PEOPLE WHO HAVE EXPERTISE ON IN IN SERVICE DELIVERY COMING TOGETHER AND TALKING ABOUT WHAT'S NEEDED WHERE THE GAPS AND WHAT WOULD THIS LOOK LIKE THE BILL WOULD BE A TAILORED CAMPAIGN FOR DIFFERENT CAN. AND THAT'S BUT GENERALLY THE THE PROPOSAL FOR TEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR A ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS WORK AND THIS IS THIS WOULD FEED INTO BOTH THE DIABETES PREVENTION PROGRAM AS WELL DIABETES TREATMENT PROGRAMS TO BE ABLE TO. GARNER COST SAVINGS FOR THE STATE. HUMAN. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENTS ON ISSUE TWENTY ONE. LIBERALS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA LIFE SCIENCES ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. TIM REID TIM MADDEN REPRESENT CALIFORNIA CHAPTER OF THE AMERICAN COLLEGE OF CARDIOLOGY INFER CARDIOLOGISTS MANY TIMES WHEN WE SEE PATIENTS HAVE DIABETES IT'S AT THE POINT WHERE IT'S TRANSITION INTO HEART DISEASE. AND WHERE THE TOUGH CONVERSATIONS WE HAVE IS IF THEY HAD A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THE RISKS AND DANGERS ASSOCIATED. WITH HAVING DIABETES THEY MAY HAVE DONE SOMETHING EARLIER SO ANYTHING WE CAN DO TO INCREASE EDUCATION NOT REACHES GREAT. FOR THESE REASONS PRINCIPLE THANK YOU SIR. THANK YOU DAVID IS ALSO BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN DIABETES ASSOCIATION AS WELL AS AMERICA'S POSITION GROUPS HAPPEN HERE IN SUPPORT IS VERY REASONABLE INVESTMENT. ON GROWING HEALTHCARE CRISIS THANK YOU. SIR. SING NO MORE PUBLIC COMMENT OPENING IT UP TO THE DYESS FUNNY COMMENTS WE HAVE. SEEING NONE WE WILL HOLD SHOULD TWENTY ONE OPEN FOR NOW AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY TWO. STILL HERE. WILL BE THE LAST TIME YOU HAVE TO HEAR FROM YOU THIS EVENING APART WITH. READY. AS AS I'M SURE YOU ARE AWARE BECAUSE WE HAVE JUST RECENTLY HAD A HEARING ABOUT IT ADVERTISED EXPERIENCES AS A MAJOR PROBLEM IN. FOR YOUTH IN PARTICULAR. THERE THE ORIGINAL IS A STUDY WAS DONE AND FOUND THAT TWO THIRDS OF ADULTS HAD AT LEAST ONE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCE IN ONE IN EIGHT HAD FOR MORE. THAN THAT THERE'S A DOSE RESPONSE BETWEEN HAVING ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AT A NUMBER OF CHRONIC CONDITIONS UP AS WELL AS BEHAVIORAL OUTCOMES THAT WE DON'T THINK TRADITIONALLY ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THINGS THAT HAPPEN IN OUR CHILDHOOD THINGS LIKE DIABETES. AND CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE BUT ALSO THINGS LIKE SMOKING. ENGAGING IN IN VIOLENT BEHAVIOR AND EVEN I'M BEING ARRESTED AND BEING CONVICTED OF FELONIES AND SO FOR THAT REASON THERE'S BEEN A LOT OF ATTENTION HAS THERE'S BEEN A GROWING BODY OF EVIDENCE AROUND ADVERSE TODD EXPERIENCES. AND THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING ABLE TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM TO PREVENT THE HARM THAT IS CAUSED BY TALK FIXTURES AS WELL AS BY BEING ABLE TO PREVENT. OP TRAUMA IN THE FIRST PLACE AND SO WHAT WE HAVE PROPOSED HERE. IS A CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD INCLUDE BRING TOGETHER STAKEHOLDERS ON THAT UNDERSTAND SOME OF THIS WORK AND ALLOW THEM TO BE ABLE TO WORK THROUGH THE PROCESS OF PILOTING FROM SO INITIALLY THERE WOULD BE. AN INTERNATIONAL LITERATURE REVIEW TO BE ABLE TO DETERMINE WHERE WE ARE IN TERMS OF SOME OF THE THE PROTOCOLS AROUND ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES. AND THEN MOVING ON TO FINDING BEST PRACTICES SO WHAT HAS BEEN DONE ON THE HAS BEEN EFFECTIVE THAT COULD BE TRIED IN PLACES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND THE DEVELOPING A TOOL KIT THAT COULD BE USED. TO BE ABLE FOR A CITIES AND COUNTIES TO BE ABLE TO. TO IMPLEMENT SOME OF THE STRATEGIES AND THEN PILOTING IN AT LEAST TWELVE CITIES OR COUNTIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA. FOCUSING IN PARTICULAR ON COMMUNITIES THAT ARE LOW ARE OF LOWER INCOME BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A COMBINATION OF INDIVIDUAL TRAUMAS AS WELL AS COMMUNITY TRAUMAS THERE ARE CONCENTRATED IN THOSE AREAS. AND THEN PROVIDING TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE IN THAT TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE WOULD INCLUDE A LOCAL ADVISORY ON BOARD AS WELL AS. LISTENING SESSIONS AND ALSO THE ABILITY FOR THAT. FOR THOSE BOARDS TO BE ABLE TO PRIORITIZE WHAT IS DONE IN THOSE COMMUNITIES SO REALLY IS A COMMUNITY INFORMED INITIATIVE. AND SO THE IDEA WOULD BE THAT THAT. THE REQUEST IS FIFTEEN MILLION DOLLARS FOR AS A ONE TIME ALLOCATION TO BE ABLE TO UP TO DO THIS WORK AND BE ABLE TO THEN COME BACK WITH FORMAL RECOMMENDATIONS ABOUT WHAT COULD BE DONE AND WHAT WE'RE ABLE TO. IMPLEMENT IN CALIFORNIA AND THIS WOULD USE PROPS PROPS SIXTY THREE. RULES. HELD GOLDSTINE PUBLIC HEALTH ADVOCATES AS WELL. YOU TAKE SOMETHING LIKE THE STUFF ON CLARK'S SHOOTING HERE IN SACRAMENTO IN THE. THE. TRAUMA THAT'S BEING EXPERIENCED IN LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES COMMUTERS A COLOR RIGHT HERE. IS JUST AN EXAMPLE OF WHAT'S GOING ON. IN COMMUNITIES ALL OVER CALIFORNIA THERE'S. PHYSICAL ABUSE. CHILD ABUSE EMOTIONAL ABUSE SEXUAL ABUSE. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE GOING ON IN FAMILIES THAT'S HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. EXAMPLES OF ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES AND THEN THERE'S ALL OF THE DRAMA GOING ON IN COMMUNITIES AS WELL. ACTUALLY JUST GOT A COPY OF A REPORT FROM THE UNITED NATIONS LE THEY'VE MADE. ADDRESSING TRAUMA A TOP PRIORITY. THERE'S A LOT GOING ON ALL OVER THE WORLD. AB BASED ON THIS UNDERSTANDING NOW IS DOCTOR CO FOR WAS DESCRIBING THAT WHAT HAPPENS TO US AS KIDS. HAS THIS ENORMOUS LONG TERM IMPACT. AND GIVEN THAT WE NOW KNOW THE US WE ACTUALLY IS CONCILIUM M. OUR EYES WHAT THAT. CHANGES IN BRAIN STRUCTURE ARE. WE HAVE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO GO UPSTREAM AND START ADDRESSING THESE UNDERLYING CAUSES USING. STRATEGIES THAT ARE NOW. PROVEN TO BE EFFECTIVE AND LIKE I SAY ALL OVER THE WORLD LET'S MAKE CALIFORNIA. BE ONE OF THE LEADERS IN THE S. AND LITERALLY IN THE PROCESS SAVE MONEY IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE COSTS. TWO BILLION TERMS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE COSTS. AND THE THE RECENT AND NUMBERS I THOUGHT I'M. KIDS WHO HAVE. BUT FOUR OR MORE OF THESE ADVERSE CHILDHOOD EXPERIENCES THEIR MOST THIRTEEN TIMES MORE LIKELY TO BE. ARRESTED. AS KIDS THESE ARE THE KIDS THAT END UP IN THE CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THE THE KIDS END UP IN THE SOCIAL SERVICE SYSTEM. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO HAVE DIFFICULTY. IN SCHOOLS. WE KNOW WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT NOW HERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO PILOT TEST. IN SOME COMMUNITIES WITH THE GREATEST NEED AND THEN. AGAIN USING IN THIS CASE PROP SIXTY THREE ADMIN FUNDING POTENTIALLY THEN. SPREADING THIS USING A OTHER PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDS. TO DO WHAT PROP SIXTY THREE IS REALLY MEANT TO DO WHICH IS ADDRESS AND PREVENT. MENTAL HEALTH PROBLEMS THANK YOU DOCTOR WILSON. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWENTY TWO. SEEING NONE I WILL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS. I WILL SAY HOW. INTERESTED I AM IN THE SUBJECT MATTER AND OFFLINE WILL HAVE CONVERSATIONS AS THIS IS GOING FORWARD. WILL HOLD ISSUE TWENTY TO OPEN A MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY THREE KICKING HERE. THANK YOU FOR YOUR PATIENCE. CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. WAS IMMEDIATE THE CALVINISTIC COUNCIL LABORS. ARE. WE R. ENGAGE QUITE A BIT INDEED LEAD ABATEMENT. BECAUSE SUCH INDUSTRY. AND WE ARE SEEKING ARE SIMPLY YOUR CONCURRENCE. AND YOUR SUPPORT TO BE ABLE TO. PACIFIC WAY. ARE. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO SEE IF WE COULD SEEK YOUR CONCURRENCE REAL TO INCREASE THE FEES CURRENT BEING CHARGED FOR ALL THOSE THAT APPLY. TO BE CERTIFIED. WHETHER CHIU TRADE INITIALLY OR TO RE JAAP THEIR ANNUAL TRAINING. FOR LEAD ABATEMENT TRACTS OF OCCASION. CURRENT DEPARTMENT OF. PUBLIC HEALTH IS A WANTED OVERSEAS THIS. AND QUITE FRANKLY THE FEE IS NOT BE INCREASED HAS BEEN INCREASE FOR OVER TWENTY TWENTY ONE YEARS. AND WE ARE SEEKING A SLIGHT INCREASE OF TEN TO TWELVE DOLLARS WOULD FEEL THAT WOULD COVER. THOSE STAFF PERSON. I WOULD PROBABLY DEFER MORE CHEER COMMITTEE CONSULTS TO BE ABLE TO IDENTIFY WHETHER NOT THIS BE SUFFICIENT UP TO BE ABLE TO. A COVER AND EXPEDITE THE PROCESSING OF THESE APPLICATIONS. WE'RE CURRENTLY. MOST RECENT DO TO THE FIRES HAPPENED HERE IN THE STATE. BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WING THINKER OBVIOUSLY HIGHER VOLUME PEOPLE PARTICIPATING IN THE PROCESS. MORE WORK IS REQUIRED TO HAVE THE TRAINING TO BE ABLE TO. FULFILL THE NEEDS FOR ALL THIS KIND OF OPERATION. AND WE ARE COMPLETELY BACKED UP WE FEEL THAT THE DEPARTMENT. SHOULD BE ABLE TO EXPEDITE THIS AND BE ABLE FROM COMING DOWN FROM THE BRIDGE A HUNDRED TWENTY DAY REQUIREMENT. THAT'S ORDERED STATUE DOWN THE SIXTY DAYS IT WAS CERTAINLY THE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE IS AT NO IMPORTANT WORKER. WHETHER OUR PEOPLE WERE OTHERWISE ARE ABLE TO REPORT TO WORK WITHOUT THE PROPER CERTIFICATION CARD. AND IT'S NOT ON THE EMPLOYER BUT ON THE EMPLOYEES. SO RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR CONSIDERATION. SIR. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWENTY THREE. SEEING NANA BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS. MAYOR OF. SINCERELY APPRECIATE THIS PROPOSAL AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU AND COMMITTEE STAFF AS THIS PROPOSAL GOES FORWARD. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWENTY THREE OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY FOUR WITH THAT. CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS BARBARA GLAZER WITH THE CALIFORNIA HOSPITAL ASSOCIATION. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE SUBCOMMITTEE FOR CONSIDERING OUR REQUEST ON TO ADOPT BUDGET TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH TO PUBLICLY POST INFORMATION ON THE CENTRALIZED APPLICATION UNITS. WORKLOAD VOLUME AND TIMELINESS OF PROCESSING HEALTH FACILITY APPLICATIONS WE LEARNED LATE LAST WEEK THAT THE DEPARTMENT ON IT HAS NOW PUT THOSE METRICS UP ON THEIR WEBSITE IT'S VERY GOOD NEWS WERE VERY PLEASED. TO SEE THAT. ARE THE ONLY THING I THINK WE'D LIKE TO ADD IS THAT WE WOULD LIKE TO BE SURE THAT THIS IS DONE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. ON WHICH I THINK IT'S THEIR PLAN AND I'D LIKE TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH WE'VE BEEN TALKING TO THEM ABOUT THIS FOR OVER A YEAR AND WE'RE VERY PLEASED TO SEE THAT IT IS NOW HAVE. SO I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THAT'S THANK YOU. WE WILL NOW TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWENTY FOUR. SEEING NONE BRING IT TO THE DYESS HA LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOU ON THIS AND. WE HOLD ISSUE TWENTY FOUR OF. THANK. ISSUE TWENTY FIVE MISTER MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE SUBCOMMITTEE TAYLOR JACKSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION. THINK YOU TO THE COMMITTEE FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO PRESENT ON THIS PROPOSAL WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY OF HOSPITAL INSPECTIONS. AS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. UNDER CURRENT LAW SEE PEACHES MANDATED TO DEPLOY A HOSPITAL INSPECTORS TO CONDUCT THE INSPECTION OF HOSPITALS FOR SPECIFIED PURPOSES UNDER CALIFORNIA STATUTES AND REGULATIONS. GENERALLY THESE INSPECTIONS ARE INTENDED FOR INSPECTORS TO MAKE FINDINGS AS WELL AS RESPOND TIMELY INAPPROPRIATELY TO ISSUES IDENTIFIED DURING THE INSPECTIONS PROCESS. HOWEVER WE'VE HEARD FROM OUR NURSES THE PRESENTS OF MANAGEMENT DURING THESE INSPECTIONS HAVE HAD A STIFLING EFFECT. ON HOSPITAL WORKERS AND OFTENTIMES INTIMIDATING PERSONNEL SO MUCH BUT THEY ARE DETERRED FROM PROVIDING MEANINGFUL FEEDBACK ABOUT PATIENT SAFETY ISSUES. AND POTENTIAL REGULATORY VIOLATIONS. THEREFORE AS NOTED IN THE SUBCOMMITTEE'S AGENDA WE WOULD LIKE TO RESPECTFULLY REQUEST THAT THE SUB COMMITTEE ADOPT TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. TO AMEND A SECTION OF THE HEALTH AND SAFETY CODE TO ALLOW EMPLOYEES OF HEALTH FACILITIES INSPECTED BY DPH. TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO DISCUSS POSSIBLE REGULATORY VIOLATIONS OR PATIENT SAFETY CONCERNS WITH AN INSPECTOR PRIVATELY DURING THE COURSE OF AN INVESTIGATION OR INSPECTION. I ALSO NOTED THIS PROVISION WOULD BE CONSISTENT WITH LABOR SECTIONS WHICH ALLOW EMPLOYEES TO SPEAK FREELY WITH INSPECTORS AT THE DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY. UNDER EXISTING LAW IF A CAL OSHA INSPECTOR COMES INTO THE HOSPITAL TO CONDUCT AN INVESTIGATION INSPECTION. THE NURSES AND OTHER WORKERS HAVE A RIGHT TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH INSPECTOR. BUT IF A DPH INSPECTOR COMES INTO THAT SAME HOSPITAL FOR AN INSPECTION THE SAME EMPLOYEE DOES NOT HAVE THAT SAME RIGHT TO SPEAK PRIVATELY. SEEKING PARITY INCONSISTENCY UNDER THE LAW. THE PRESENCE OF MANAGEMENT TRADE THESE INSPECTIONS HAS NO CORRELATION TO IMPROVE QUALITY OR OUTCOMES. HOUSING HAS A CHILLING EFFECT ON WORKERS AND HAS ONLY RESULTED IN THE EMISSION OF IMPORTANT ISSUES WORKERS NO NEED TO BE ADDRESSED. ADOPTING THESE PROVISIONS WILL IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AS INSPECTORS GET A MORE ACCURATE DEPICTION OF WHAT THE STATE OF AFFAIRS IS AT ANY GIVEN HOSPITAL. WHICH WILL LIKELY RESULT IN CURBING THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL OR FOLLOW UP INSPECTIONS BEING CONDUCTED BY DPH. WHICH ARE OFTEN PROMPTED BY ANONYMOUS CALLS FROM HOSPITAL PERSONNEL. WE APPRECIATE YOUR CONSIDERATION OF THIS IMPORTANT PROPOSAL AND ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT IN ADOPTING TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE. WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE INTEGRITY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INSPECTIONS AT THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH BY ENSURING THAT HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES ARE ABLE SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH THEIR CD PEACH INVEST INSPECTORS. JUST LIKE WORKERS ARE ALLOWED TO SPEAK PRIVATELY WITH CAL OSHA INSPECTORS NOW. HUMAN. WE WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWENTY FIVE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK WINDOWS WITH US HERE YOU CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF OUR THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND NURSES WOULD JUST LIKE TO. ECHO THE POINTS MADE BY MS JACKSON. SEEING NO FURTHER PUBLIC COMMENT WE WILL BRING IT TO THE DYESS AND. CORD TO WORKING WITH YOU AS WELL. WHO HOLD ISSUE TWENTY FIVE OPEN? ISSUE TWENTY SIX BUT AFTER GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I'M SHE NICENO THE DEPUTY DIRECTOR OF THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. TO PRESENT OUR TRAILER BILL PROPOSAL TO CONTINUE TO USE FEDERAL STANDARDS IN LIEU OF DEVELOPING STATE LICENSING STANDARDS. FOR AMBULATORY SURGERY CENTERS COMPREHENSIVE OUTPATIENT REHABILITATION FACILITIES AN END STAGE RENAL DISEASE FACILITIES. WE. WE WERE GIVEN TEMPORARY AUTHORITY TO USE THE FEDERAL STANDARDS WHILE WE CONDUCTED A STUDY. OF WHETHER THE FEDERAL STANDARDS WERE SUFFICIENT AND WE CONTRACTED WITH THE UC DAVIS INSTITUTE FOR POPULATION HEALTH IMPROVEMENT. TWO DO THAT EVALUATION THEIR EVALUATION FOUND THAT THEY DID BELIEVE THAT THE FEDERAL STANDARDS WERE ADEQUATE. TO BE USED IN LIEU OF THE DEPARTMENT DEVELOPING STATE LICENSING STANDARDS WE PRESENTED THE. UC DAVIS STUDY AT A PUBLIC STAKEHOLDER MEETING AND ALSO HAD OPEN. FORM FOR PUBLIC COMMENT WE RECEIVED NO OPPOSING COMMENTS AND SO WE JUST WISH TO MAKE THIS PROVISION PERMANENT. COMMAND. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE EARLIER. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWENTY SIX. SEEING NONE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWENTY SIX OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN. AND A GOOD EVENING MY NAME IS SCOTT OF ALL AND THE SYSTEM THAT THE DIRECTOR FOR THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. C. P. H.. OTHER TOMORROW PUBLIC HEALTH REQUEST THREE TWO POSITIONS AN EXPONENTIAL AUTHORITY OF TWO POINT FOUR MILLION DOLLARS FOR THE LICENSE REVOCATION PROGRAM FUND.

SAFE SECURE ACTIVELY EXAMINING A RESIGNED HIS BUSINESS PROCESSES TO MORE EFFECTIVELY PERFORM THE MYSTERY OF FIELD WORK LOAD. IN A TIME TIME A CONSISTENT MANNER AND USES THE SUFFICIENT TO IMPROVE OUR EFFICIENCY. THE PROPOSAL ALSO PROVIDES RESOURCES TO CONDUCT A MANAGE CONTROL QUALITY PROVE PROJECTS AUGMENTS HIS WITHIN OUR CENTERS OF PERSONAL SERVER KITCHEN BRANCH TO ADDRESS ANTICIPATED INCREASES IN THE NUMBER INDIVIDUALS SEEKING TO BE LICENSED AND CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS. AND PROVIDES RESOURCES TO PROCESS ENVIRON WORKFORCE SHORTAGE AND THE TREATY WAIVERS AS A RESULT OF CHANGES MADE VICE SENATE BILL NINETY SEVEN LAST YEAR. DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE OLYMPIC.

MITIGATE BACKLOG AND ALSO A POSITION THEM AWHILE TO AND. TO ADDRESS THE WORKLOAD ASSOCIATED WITH IMPLEMENTING AND A NEW STAFFING STANDARDS. PLAYER. SONYA PARA KALLIO. WE'VE REVIEWED THE REQUEST FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH FOR ADDITIONAL POSITIONS IN THE CENTER FOR HEALTH CARE QUALITY. FIFTEEN OF THESE POSITIONS ARE REALLY IN RESPONSE TO THESE NEW STAFFING REQUIREMENTS AT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES AND IN. A RESPONSE TO THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN DEMAND FOR CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS AS WELL AS CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANT TRAINING PROGRAMS. WE WANT TO NOTE THAT THIS PROPOSAL IS ONE PROPOSAL IN A PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PUT FORWARD. THERE ARE PROPOSALS IN THE EMPLOYMENT DEVELOP DEVELOPMENT DEPARTMENT DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH. SO ARE OVER OUR OFFICE JUST RELEASED. ANALYSIS OF THIS PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS THE THUNDER WEBSITE BUTTER OVERARCHING RECOMMENDATION IS FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO. CONSIDER THE PACKAGE OF PROPOSALS AS A WHOLE RATHER THAN CONSIDERING EACH OF THESE COMPONENTS. IN A SILO TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY WORK WELL TOGETHER AND THAT. YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE CONSIDERING FOR EXAMPLE STAFFING POSITIONS OF PUBLIC HEALTH. THAT IT'S THE RIGHT NUMBER BASED ON SOME OF THE OTHER. PROPOSALS THAT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSED. I'M IN ADDITION WE HAVE A FEW CONCERNS ABOUT THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH'S A SPECIFIC PROPOSAL. ONE OF THE IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT FIFTEEN POSITIONS ARE REALLY NEEDED SO IN THE COURSE OF. ANALYZING THIS A PROPOSAL WE LEARNED THAT FOR EXAMPLE THE DEPARTMENT WILL BE. LAUNCHING AN ONLINE AN ONLINE SYSTEM. THIS HOPEFULLY THIS CALENDAR YEAR. THAT WILL ALLOW. NURSE NURSES TO. THEIR SUBSISTENCE RATHER TO SUBMIT THEIR APPLICATIONS ONLINE. PRESUMABLY. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE NEED FOR AS MANY POSITIONS. AT DPH TO REVIEW THOSE APPLICATIONS. IN ADDITION WERE NOT CONVINCED THAT ALL OF ALL FIFTEEN POSITIONS NEED TO BE PERMANENT. SO FOR EXAMPLE AS SOME OF THE WAIVER APPLICATIONS THAT SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES MY REQUEST. AS WELL AS. NEW APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS WE EXPECT THAT THOSE MAY. CERTAIN PEAK IN THE FIRST FEW YEARS AND THEN TAPER OFF AND IN FACT IF. IF MANY OF THE SKILLED NURSING FACILITIES ARE STILL REQUESTING. WAIVERS AFTER THREE YEARS WHEAT YOU KNOW WE MIGHT HAVE SOME ADDITIONAL CONCERNS ABOUT WHAT'S NOT WORKING. AND FINALLY WE WOULD JUST NOTE THAT IF. IF THESE POSITIONS OUR OR SOME A NUMBER OF POSITIONS ARE IMPROVED. WE WOULD ALSO RECOMMEND GREATER TRANSPARENCY ABOUT PROCESSING TIMES ON TO SEE IF THESE POSITIONS ARE REALLY IMPROVING THE PROCESSING TIMES FORGETTING CERTIFIED NURSE ASSISTANTS. OUT IN THE WORKFORCE. THANK YOU. PUBLIC COMMENT ON ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN. XENON ALL BRING IT UP TO THE DYESS COMING UP THE DEPARTMENT'S RESPONSE REGARDING TEMPORARY VERSES PERMANENT NEED FOR. THE POSITIONS AS WELL AS THE METRICS TO FOLLOW UP ON AND WHETHER PROCESSING TIME WOULD BE AN APPROPRIATE METRICS CHERYL ALL START MAYBE MY COLLEAGUES WILL JOIN AND. SO WE HAVE NO IDEA REALLY WHAT THE ONGOING NEEDS WILL BE WE WE SUSPECT THAT THERE WILL BE A GREAT DEMAND OF FROM OVER HERE FOR THE INDUSTRY FOR THOSE INDIVIDUALS ARE LOS FELIZ WANTING TO. HAVE A WAIVER REQUESTS SO THAT REGARD WE ANTICIPATE A A HIGH DEMAND THE IN THE CAREER AS WELL AS THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS TO COME. AS PEOPLE BEGIN TO TRY TO CHURN AND AND AND WRAP UP THEIR OWN INDIVIDUAL AND STAFFING IS IN THE DEPARTMENT ARE IN THE OF SLEAZE COMMENTS BUT WE BELIEVE THAT THEY'LL BE AN ONGOING A REQUEST FOR WAIVER APPLICATIONS. AND WITH REGARD TO OUR PROCESSING OF OUR SCENE NAY OF SEEING THE APPLICATIONS THEMSELVES. AGAIN WE DO ANTICIPATE TRYING TO BRING ONLINE A A SYSTEM FOR A HELPING THAT THE PROCESS BE MORE AUTOMATED A BUT WE HAVEN'T EVEN YET OF BEGIN TO EVEN THINK ABOUT WHAT THAT WAS GONNA LOOK LIKE LET ALONE. A CONTRACT AND SO THE DEVELOPMENT THAT IS STILL SOME SOME WAYS OUT BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT WE HAVEN'T VERY AGING POPULATION A WE HAVE A. A HIGH DEMAND IN OUR FACILITIES WE HAVE WE ALSO KNOW THAT THIS WORKFORCE IS A WORKFORCE THAT TURNS A LOT AND SO THIS CAN BE A LOT OF ACTIVITIES. PICKING OF THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR THE NEXT TEN YEARS AS PEOPLE CYCLE IN AND OUT OF OF THE PROCESS. AND I WOULD JUST ADD WORTH RELATIONSHIP TO THE METRICS. WE ARE NOW LOOKING AT WE WE ARE COMMITTED TO TRANSPARENCY M. ANYWAY JUST AS YOU HEARD ADDED METRICS FOR CA YOU AND SO WE ARE WORKING WE'VE WE'VE JUST BEGUN. WORKING TO DEVELOP METRICS TO POSE FOR THE PROFESSIONAL CERTIFICATION BRANCH SO WE NEED TO DEVELOP THE MEASUREMENTS OF WE HAVE SOME INTERNALLY BUT WE NEED TO. DEVELOPMENT A TRACKABLE WAY AND THEN THERE'S THE ISSUE OF WORKING WITH THE CONTRACTOR TO BE ABLE TO GET THEM ONLINE IN THE FORMAT THAT WE PUT THE OTHER METRICS OF THAT THEY'RE EASILY SEARCHABLE AND PEOPLE CAN DO ALL THE FILTERING SO. WE ARE WORKING ON THAT BUT IT IS SOME NOISE OUT. WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE TWENTY SEVEN OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TWENTY. GERMAN PROBLEM SOME A METAL MATHIS DREW JOHNSON THE BEST PART IN A PUBLIC HEALTH. THIS PROPOSAL REQUESTS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE THAT WOULD ALLOW THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE TO INCREASE OUR EXPENDITURE AUTHORITY IN THE BUDGET YEAR IN THE EVENT THAT THE MANUFACTURING CYCLE FOR. TREATMENT FOR INFANT BOTULISM BABY BIG IS MOVED UP AND LEAKS INTO THE INTO THE BUDGET YEAR. WE'VE BEEN IN CONTACT MORE RECENTLY WITH THE ONLY FDA APPROVED. PHARMACEUTICAL BIOTECH PHARMACEUTICAL THAT MANUFACTURES. BABY BIG AND THEY'VE GIVEN US SOME SEVERAL OPTIONS TO WORK WITH THIS A BABY BIG MANUFACTURING COMPETES WITH MANY OF THEIR COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS. SO WERE TOTAL BIT BEHOLDEN TO KIND OF THEIR SCHEDULING AND SOME IT COULD BE MOVED UP AS THE BUDGET WHICH WOULD REQUIRE SOME ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY ON OUR END. BERMAN FINANCE ELIA.

ROBERT TAYLOR EMERGENCY PREPAREDNESS OFFICE OF CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC. I AM SO I'M HERE TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE. PROVISIONAL ENGLISH OR REQUESTING FOURTH BE A CRISIS GRANT THAT'S NOW BEING ISSUED BY THE. US CDC SERVICE GRANT IS. SORT OF A NEW APPROACH FOR THE CDC FOR EMERGENCY FUNDING. ARM AND IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH IN THE PAST THEY'VE. IT ISSUED OF MERCHANTS HE FUNDING LIKE. AFFORDABLE AND SIKA. A SORT OF EARMARKED FUNDS THAT CAME A LITTLE BIT LATE IN THE ACTUAL EMERGENCY SO THEY ARE NOW. PUTTING OUT A GRANT THAT IS. SOARED AND IDENTIFIED. IN EACH STATE APPLIES A. KIND OF ONCE A YEAR AND WE'VE APPLIED AN WE ARE NOW ON WHAT TO CON APPROVED BUT UNFUNDED STATUS. SO IF THERE'S AN EMERGENCY. AND THE RISES TO THE LEVEL OF THE. CDC DESIGNATED EMERGENCY THEN WE WOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE FUNDING SELECT RIGHT NOW THEY'RE USING THIS CRAP TO FUND ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE HURRICANES. AND. THE FUNNY WOULD BE AVAILABLE MORE QUICKLY THAN HAVING TO WAIT FOR SPECIALIZED EARMARKED GRANT. THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE GRANT THOUGH IT ALSO THAT THE STATE BE AVAILABLE TO SPEND THE MONEY QUICKLY. SO THE PROVISIONAL LANGUAGE WOULD ALLOW FOR THE NOTIFICATION TO THE LEGISLATURE BUT THE AUGMENTATION OF OUR BUDGETS I'M BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE IN ORDER TO ALLOW US TO BUILD THE SPEND THE MONEY.
