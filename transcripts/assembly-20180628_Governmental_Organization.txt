BEGIN AS A SUBCOMMITTEE. SERGEANTS IF YOU'D CONTACT THE OTHER MEMBERS OF US SO THAT WE COULD ESTABLISH. QUORUM AT THE SOONEST AVAILABLE OPPORTUNITY LOGAN HOUSEKEEPING FOR EVERYONE'S AGENDA ITEM NUMBER -- TWO HUESO HAS BEEN PULLED -- ITEM NUMBER THREE SEVEN NINE FOUR STERN HAS BEEN PULLED. AND WE'RE GOING TO A BEGINNER. WITH MISTER DODD. ITEM NUMBER SEVEN S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WELCOMING A SENATOR. S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD ESTABLISH REQUIREMENTS FOR UTILITIES PROTECT AGAINST DAMAGE FROM. DIFFERENT NATURAL DISASTERS AND WILD FIRES AS WELL AS INVEST IN INFRASTRUCTURE UPGRADES. THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE RISK OF IGNITING NEW WILDFIRES. NOT WITHSTANDING APPROVING COST SAVINGS OF AT LEAST THREE TO ONE THE CP YOU SEE IS NOT ESTABLISHED ADEQUATE STANDARDS FOR UTILITIES. TO REDUCE THE RISK OF WILDFIRES CAUSED BY UTILITY EQUIPMENT. AND MAKE THEIR WEEK EQUIPMENT MORE RESILIENT AND RESISTANT TO DAMAGE FROM MAJOR DISASTER YOU VETS. SP TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD REQUIRE THE OFFICE OF EMERGENCY SERVICES. TO ESTABLISH STANDARDS FOR UTILITIES TO PROTECT AGAINST DAMAGE FROM A VARIETY OF NATURAL DISASTERS. IT REQUIRE UTILITIES FILE SAFETY RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY PLANTS WITH THE CPUC. PLAN DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE COORDINATED WITH LOCAL GOVERNMENTS AND FIRE AGENCIES. THE PLANT WOULDN'T INCLUDE ALL ESTIMATED COST TO IMPLEMENT THE PLAN IN THE CPUC WOULD REVIEW MODIFY APPROVED THE PLANS INCLUDING THE COST TO IMPLEMENT THEM. ESTABLISHING A STATE STANDALONE SAFETY PROCEEDING WOULD REQUIRE INVESTOR OWNED UTILITIES IN THE CPU CD GIVE GREATER ATTENTION. TAKE CARE TO SAFETY AND RELIABILITY. THE BILL WOULD ESTABLISH STRONG ACCOUNTABILITY REQUIREMENTS IN PROVIDE FOR PUBLIC INPUT FOR PLAN DESIGN. UTILITIES WOULD BE OR PROHIBITED FROM DIVERTING MONEY TO SAFETY RELIABILITY RESILIENCE AND PROHIBITED FROM DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR IMPLEMENTING THE PLAN TO ANY OTHERS. MOREOVER S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD MAKE THE PLANNING AND RATE PROCESS FOR SAFETY RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCE. TRANSPARENT AND PUBLIC. MISTER CHAIRMAN THE ANALYSIS DESCRIBED SEVERAL AMENDMENTS I AM OFFERING AS AUTHOR IT'S AMENDMENTS AND THIS IS ON PAGE. EIGHT OF YOUR ANALYSIS. THESE AMENDMENTS MAKE CRYSTAL CLEAR THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL SHOT OBLIGATE RATEPAYERS TO PAY FOR UTILITY NEGLIGENCE. REPAIR SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO PAY FOR ANYTHING NOT APPROVED UNDER THE STATE HE PLAN. IN THE AMENDMENTS CLARIFY. THAT NOTHING IN THIS BILL WILL REMOVE OR ADD ANY C. C. A. AUTHORITY IN CURRENT LAW. WITH THE BILL. IN THESE AMENDMENTS GIVE GUIDANCE TO THE CPUC WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR ALLOCATION OF COSTS TO IMPLEMENT THE SAFETY PLAN. S. B. TEN EIGHTY EIGHT IS SUPPORTED BY A BUSINESS LABOR UTILITIES LOCAL GOVERNMENT MORE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THEY SAID WE'RE GOING -- TO PAUSE AND ESTABLISH A CORE. SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL GREAT [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] BIGELOW [inaudible] ACOSTA [inaudible] HERE AGUIAR-CURRY [inaudible] BERMAN [inaudible] BONTA. DALY HERE GALLAGHER. EDUARDO GARCIA. GIPSON [inaudible] HERE [inaudible] GLORIA [inaudible] JONES SAWYER [inaudible] KILEY [inaudible] LACKEY [inaudible] LIVING HERE BUT LOW. RUBIO [inaudible] SILAS [inaudible] WALDRON. WITH THE BILL. OKAY WE HAVE A QUORUM ESTABLISH WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. I DO WE HAVE -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBER SCOTT WHAT SHOULD BE AT THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF ELECTRICAL WORKERS CAN BE VERY BRIEF MAKE THREE POINTS. BECAUSE OF THE LIABILITY ISSUES IN THE WILD FIRES WITH MOST PEOPLE DON'T REALIZE IS THAT EVERY YEAR. THE UTILITIES GET ABOUT 25% OF THE MONEY THEY INVEST INTO THE SYSTEM FOR OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE FROM THE INVESTMENT COMMUNITY. THAT'S NOW GONE SO AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED TO INVEST TO HARDEN THE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT MORE FIREPROOF. WERE ACTUALLY GONNA HAVE LESS THEN A ROLE YOU HAVE 75% OR LESS OF THE DOLLARS WE TYPICALLY WOULD HAVE TO INVEST. SO THIS BILL IS CRITICAL IN THAT IT FORCES THE P. YOU SEE FOR THE FIRST TIME TO FOCUS ON SAFETY AND AND PUT MORE TIME AND EFFORT INTO SAFETY. THE SECOND THING THAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT OPENS UP THE PROCESS TO ALLOW LOCAL GOVERNMENTS LOCAL FIRE OFFICIALS TO PART TO PAY. AND THEN LASTLY THE AMENDMENTS THAT THE AUTHOR WORKED OUT WITH THE COMMITTEE ARE REALLY GROUNDBREAKING MISTER CHAIRMAN. IN TWO RESPECTS IT SAYS THAT. NGUYEN THESE PLANS ARE ADOPTED AND WIN THE PEACE YOU SEE THEN ADOPTS. A A RATE INCREASE LIKE THEY DO IN EVERY RATE CASE. FOR INVESTMENT BUT WHEN THEY ADOPT A RATE INCREASE TO HELP PAY FOR THIS INVESTMENT IN THE SYSTEM. THAT THEY'VE THE RATE INCREASE HAS TO BE PROPORTIONAL TO THE BENEFIT. THAT IS RECEIVED BY EACH RATE TEAR. EACH RATE CLASS SO THAT IT PROTECTS AGAINST -- FOR INSTANCE THERE'S CONCERNS THAT PERHAPS INDUSTRIAL OR AGRICULTURAL OR BUSINESS -- RATEPAYERS WOULD BE DISPROPORTIONATELY HIT THIS PROTECTS AGAINST THAT THE SECOND THING THAT IT DOES THAT IS GROUNDBREAKING. IS IT IS STATES THAT WHEN THE RATE INCREASE IS APPROVED LIKE IT IS IN EVERY GENERATE CASE TO PAY FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. THAT THE RATE INCREASE HAS TO BE APPLIED [inaudible] GEOGRAPHICALLY. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS FOR EXAMPLE [inaudible] IF. SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS IS APPROVED IN. NEED -- TERRITORY FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN THE SYSTEM. AND A A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF THEM ARE BEING APPLIED IN THE STATE. 80% OF ITS GOING TO THE BAY AREA AIR 80% IS GOING TO ONE PARTICULAR AREA. THE RATE INCREASE WE PROPORTIONATE TO WEAR THAT BENEFIT WILL GO SAID THE RATE PAYERS WILL ONLY BE PAYING FOR THAT HARDENING OF THE SYSTEM. IN THEIR LOCAL COMMUNITY AND THEN OVER YEAR OVER THE YEARS AS THEY GO THROUGH IN AND HARDEN THE SYSTEM IT WILL BE UP APPLIED EQUITABLY SO UP FOR THOSE REASONS WE WOULD. URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS MARK JOSEPH WHEN HALF OF THE COALITION OF CALIFORNIA UTILITY EMPLOYEES. I'VE BEEN A LAWYER PRACTICING BEFORE THE P. YOU SEE FOR MORE THAN TWENTY YEARS AND I'VE INVOLVED AND GENERATE CASES FOR ALL OF THAT TIME. AND WHAT I CAN TELL YOU IS THAT SAFETY RELIABILITY IS NOT THE FOCUS OF THOSE RATE CASES. AND THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT THIS BILL THIS IS GOING TO SOLVE. RIGHT NOW STE SAFETY RELIABILITY IS JUST A BY PRODUCT OF HAGGLING OVER MONEY AND THERE'S NEVER A DIRECT FOCUS ON SAFETY RELIABILITY. THIS BILL. WOULD IMPLEMENT A TWO STEP PROCESS. EVERY OTHER YEAR EACH UTILITY HAS TO FILE A SAFETY RELIABILITY PLAN. IT WILL GET FULL REVIEW IT COULD AT EXACTLY THE SAME LEVEL OF DETAIL AS ANY RATE CASE GETS. FULL REVIEW BY THE COMMISSION AND BY ALL THE INTERESTED PARTIES -- ANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ANYBODY INTERESTED IN SAFE RELIABILITY IN THEIR COMMUNITY CAN PARTICIPATE. AND SECOND THAT THE COMMISSION AFTER APPROVING THOSE PLANS AND THE COST TO IMPLEMENT THOSE PLANS. THEN EVERY YEAR AND THIS IS A BRAND NEW THING WHICH DOESN'T EXIST NOW EVERY YEAR THE COMMISSION. WE'LL EVALUATE WHETHER THE UTILITY COMPLIED WITH ITS PLAN AND THERE CAN BE HELD ACCOUNTABLE. AND IF THEY FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THE PLANT THEY WILL BE FINE. THIS IS SOMETHING WHICH DOES NOT EXIST NOW AND SHOULD GREATLY INCREASE THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY BECAUSE UTILITIES FEET WILL BE HELD TO THE FIRE. SPECIFICALLY ON THE ISSUE OF COSTS. THIS BILL IS BEEN AMENDED ABOUT SIX TIMES NOW. AND WITH EACH AMENDMENT THERE'S BEEN MORE AND MORE FOCUSED TO BE SURE THAT THIS DOES NOT GRANT ANY KIND OF A BLANK CHECK TO THE UTILITIES -- OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THIS BILL NOW SAYS THAT ALL THE COSTS THAT ARE APPROVED HAVE TO BE JUST AND REASONABLE -- AND IN PARTICULAR IS MISTER WEST SAID. THE PAYING FOR ANY INCREASE COSTS THAT ARE APPROVED WILL BE FOCUSED BOTH GEOGRAPHICALLY AND BY RATE CLASS FOR THE FIRST TIME. SO THE PEOPLE WHO ARE GETTING THE BENEFITS WILL BE PAYING A PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT GETTING THE BENEFITS WON'T BE PAYING. THIS IS A A CAREFULLY BALANCED IN MEASURE PROVISION WHICH WILL IMPROVE THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE SYSTEM. HOPEFULLY DECREASE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FUTURE FIRES AND OTHER DISASTERS -- AND HELP US RECOVER FROM THEM AFTERWARDS THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN -- MEMBERS OF MY NAME IS HERSH TURN I'M WITH THE IBEW LOCAL TWELVE FORTY FIVE WE REPRESENT THE WORKERS AT MANY UTILITIES IN NORTHERN CENTRAL CALIFORNIA AS WELL AND IN PARTICULAR P. JEANNIE -- WE HAVE TWENTY ONE THOUSAND MEMBERS AND OVER TWELVE THOUSAND MEMBERS WORKING AT PGE. SO -- THE WORD IS SAFETY -- YOU'VE HEARD IT PROBABLY. FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TIMES ALREADY I'M GONNA SAY IT AGAIN AND IF I COULD SAY IT FIFTEEN SIXTEEN TIMES. AGAIN I WILL ACCEPT I'D PROLLY BORE YOU -- A FOCUS OF THE ANALYSIS -- ALSO INCLUDES PACIFIC RIGHT -- REVISIONS AND IMPROVEMENTS TO GEO NINETY FIVE THE GENERAL ORDERS FOR US IN THE IBEW OUR SAFETY BIBLE -- THIS IS HOW WE KEEP THE SYSTEM SAFE THE IMPROVEMENTS HERE AND THE FOCUS ON GENERAL ORDERS ARE BECAUSE THEY ARE IN ADEQUATE. TO DEAL WITH THE CURRENT CLIMATE CONDITIONS WE NEED TO CHANGE THEM AND WE NEED TO CHANGE AND IMPROVE THE SYSTEM THE DISTRIBUTION AND TRANSMISSION SYSTEM. IN ORDER TO ASSURE THAT THOSE THAT THE CHANGES DO MEET THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE IN THE FIELD OUR MEMBERS ARE MORE THAN HALF EAGER TO MAKE SURE THAT THEIR CUSTOMERS. AND THE AND THE CALIFORNIA AS A WHOLE ARE SAFE AND WE WERE IN WE WANT TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE THAT SERVICE AS WE HAVE -- FOR SEVENTY FIVE YEARS NOW -- AND WE KNOW THAT WE CAN BUT WE WANT THIS WE NEED THIS BILL TO ENSURE THAT THAT FOCUS THE FOCUS ON SAFETY IS WHAT WE'RE ADDRESSING. CONSISTENTLY AND FROM HERE ON OUT [inaudible] THANK YOU. ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN SUPPORT THERE ARE AN ABSOLUTE. BILL HONOR JR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MITCH SNIDER CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION ALSO IN SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MATT BROWN ON BEHALF OF ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS OF CALIFORNIA YOU W. YOU A LOCAL ONE THREE TWO ONE SPORT THANK YOU. AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS CHRIS PATTERSON ON BEHALF OF PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC AND STRONG SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE OPAQUE HOUSE A PRESIDENCY INDIA GAS ELECTRIC IN STRONG SUPPORT. IT SEEMS AT A MINIMUM WE HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS AND STRENGTHEN THE SYSTEM. KEEP EVERYBODY SAFE AND CHRIS ARE ABILITY TO HAVE RESPONDED THESE WILDFIRES THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS CARE ABOUT WAS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA EDISON IN SUPPORT. OKAY ANY TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. THAT AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF NOT YOUR HERNANDEZ HERE ON BEHALF OF THE UTILITY REFORM NETWORK RETURN CONSUMER. ADVOCATES AS WELL AS ON BEHALF OF THE CONSUMER FEDERATION OF CALIFORNIA IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. THEIR NUMBER PROBLEMS WITH THE BILL BELOW ME JUST FOCUS ON ONE AND THAT IS THAT THE MAJOR CRUX OF WHAT THIS BILL IS DOING THAT CONCERNS US. IS THAT IT WILL. ENABLE. UTILITIES TO SHIFT COSTS OF MAJOR EVENTS TO RATEPAYERS IN A WAY THAT IS NOT ALLOWED UNDER CURRENT LAW. IT IS A MAJOR CHANGE. LET ME LET ME JUST CLARIFY AND IT IT IT ADDRESSES THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE TAKEN TODAY. THERE TO PROCESSES RIGHT NOW THERE IS THE CIVIL ACTION IN COURT LITIGATION THAT TAKES PLACE OF P. GENIUSES. PARALLEL TO THAT THERE IS AN ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS THAT IS HANDLED THE CPUC. IN COURT YOU LOOK AT NEGLIGENCE THE COMMISSION YOU LOOK AT WHETHER NOT UTILITY ACTED PRUDENTLY [inaudible] I IN THE MAJOR MEN WHETHER THEY IT SHOULD BE LIABLE SHOULD PAY FOR THE COSTS OF THE MAJOR EVENT. IF UTILITIES FOUND. TO HAVE ACTED IMPRUDENTLY IN THE COMMISSION. WILL NOT ALLOW RATEPAYERS TO COVER THE COSTS OF A MAJOR EVENT. WITH THIS BILL DOES IS REPLACE THAT [inaudible] FACT FINDING. RIGHT NOW THE COMMISSION LOOK AT ALL FACTS RELATED TO THIS SPECIFIC EVENT. AND DETERMINAR ABILITY. THE BILL INSTEAD. WOULD ONLY ALLOW THE COMMISSION ASK ONE QUESTION. AND THAT IS IS THERE A PLAN. THAT HAS BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH THAT'S IT NOT ALL FACTS. ONLY IF THE PLANET BEEN SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH AND THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM. BECAUSE THERE MAY BE FACTS THAT WOULD INDICATE LIABILITY FOR THE UTILITY. WHICH PREVENT SHIFTING THE COSTS TO RATEPAYERS. BUT TEN NEED IT WOULD NOT ALLOW THAT LET ME BE CLEAR THIS IS FOR THE CPC PROCEEDING. THE LANGUAGE TODAY THE INTENT LANGUAGE WAS TAKEN TODAY. REFERS TO NEGLIGENCE THAT IS A COURT PROCEEDING. THAT IS NOT TO SEE THE CPC PROCEEDING. AND IN THE EVENT THAT 99% THE TIME THESE CASES ARE SETTLED IN COURT OR OUT OF COURT WITHOUT A TRIAL. THERE'S NO FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE IT'S AN OUT OF COURT SETTLEMENT. SO IT LEAVES UNTOUCHED. PROVISION OF THE BILL THAT SAYS. THE COMMISSION CAN ONLY LOOK AT WHETHER THERE WAS A PLAN. WAS A COMPLIED WITH. IF IS COMPLIED WITH THEN THERE IS AUTOMATIC. LIABILITY SHIELD FOR THE UTILITY WHICH MEANS THE RATEPAYERS. WHO PAY FOR THE SAFETY MITIGATION ON THE FRONT END? WILL ALSO BE ABLE BE FORCED TO PAY FOR THE COSTS OF THE WILDFIRES TO ANY OTHER MAJOR EVENT. THAT IS A MAJOR PROBLEM AND THE REASONS WHY WE ARE. OPPOSED TO THIS BILL I'M HAPPY ANSWER QUESTIONS ON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE MICHAEL SAW CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION AND FOR SOMEONE OF KNOWLEDGE -- THE EFFORT OF THE CHAIR TO ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE EXPRESSED -- BOTH IN MEETINGS AND PREVIOUSLY IN -- IN COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND THE AUTHOR OF FOR WORKING ON THAT AS WELL HOWEVER -- THEY DAY THEY DON'T GO FAR ENOUGH THE FIRST RECOMMENDED AMENDMENT TALKS ABOUT CONSIDERING -- YEAH THESE FACTORS. CONSIDER IS VERY WEAK -- BECAUSE IT DOES NOT MEAN THAT THE PEACE YOU HAVE TO DO ANYTHING DIFFERENT. THEM WHAT THEY HAVE DONE TODAY. ARE THEY CAN CONTINUE WITH THEIR THE PROCESS AS THEY HAVE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THAT PROCESS WORKS OUT. VERY WELL FOR REPAIRS -- CONCERT OR IN ADDITION TO THAT -- I THINK IS MISTER HERNANDEZ IS ALREADY EXPLAINED THE REDEFINING JUST AND REASONABLE -- AS THIS BILL DOES. CREATES A BIT OF A LOOP WHERE JUST AND REASONABLE FEES INTO THE SECTION FOR FIFTY ONE IN THE PUBLIC UTILITIES CODE. SMITH TALKS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT UTILITIES CAN PUT INTO THE RATES WELL IF IT'S JUST AND REASONABLE% MAKE IT PUT IT INTO THEIR RATES -- BEEN LATER THE AMENDMENTS THAT WE HAVE BEEN OFFERED BY THE COMMITTEE TALK ABOUT -- MAKING SURE THAT IT'S CONSISTENT WITH SECTION FOUR FIFTY ONE SO THE BILL KINDA POINTS BACK AROUND THROUGH SECTION FOR FIFTY ONE BACK TO ITSELF WITH THE AMENDMENTS. AND THAT IS A CONCERN BECAUSE IT DOES NOT ADDRESS THE OF THE SUBSTANTIVE ISSUE THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT. THE LAST POINT I'D LIKE TO MAKE IS. WE ALL AGREE -- CRITICAL SAFETY IS IMPORTANT. WE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO PREVENT ALL WILDFIRES BUT IT SHOULD BE OUR GOAL TO DO AS MUCH AS WE CAN TO PREVENT THOSE -- AND MITIGATE THE DAMAGE TO YOUR COMMUNITIES HOW TO OUR BUSINESSES -- AND TO THE STATE AS A WHOLE. HOWEVER THIS BILL GOES FURTHER PROVIDING LIABILITY PROTECTION TO THE UTILITIES AND UNFORTUNATELY BECAUSE OF THOSE THOSE ISSUES WE CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BILL THE TIME. MICHAEL VOCAL OR ON BEHALF OF THE AG ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION REPRESENTING. MANY OF THE LARGEST SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. FARMING OPERATIONS FOOD PROCESSORS AND WATER AGENCIES WHO YOU SIGNIFICANT ENERGY. LIKE MISTER JOSEPH I'VE BEEN PARTICIPATING IN RAPE CASES GENERATE CASES BEFORE THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION NOW 428- YEARS. I'M I'M GONNA VIGOROUSLY DISAGREE WITH HIS CHARACTERIZATION THAT RAPE CASES ARE NOT ABOUT SAFETY. YOU CAN GIVE YOU TWO VERY CONCRETE EXAMPLES. ONE IS WHAT'S GOING ON RIGHT NOW AND THE SO CAL GAS GENERAL CASE. AS IT RELATES TO ALMOST ENTIRELY THE IMPACTS AND SAFETY MEASURES THAT HAVE PUT IN PLACE. SINCE ONLY SO CANYON THEY'RE ASKING 440% RATE INCREASE OF THEIR CUSTOMERS TO COVER THE COSTS. SAME THING HAPPENED IN PJ NAY FOLLOWING SAN BRUNO AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT. SO FOR SOMEONE TO SUGGEST THAT THESE CASES AREN'T ABOUT SAFETY IS JUST FLAT OUT WRONG. THEY'RE ENTIRELY ABOUT SAFETY WHEN SAFETY IS THE PRIMARY ISSUE. AND THAT'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA HAVE HERE IN THE NEXT GENERAL RATE CASE WITH P. JEANNIE. RATES ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO CUSTOMERS AS RIPPER ALL I'M WELL AWARE WE KNOW WE'RE GOING TO BE PICKING UP SOME ADDITIONAL COSTS BECAUSE WE NEED TO MAKE THE SYSTEM SAFER. IN RATE PAYERS ARE GONNA PICK UP THOSE COSTS THIS BILL UNFORTUNATELY SET UP A PROCESS WHERE I DO BELIEVE IT IS A ALMOST A BLANK CHECK FOR THE UTILITIES. THEY DON'T HAVE ANY SKIN IN THIS GAME WHY WOULDN'T YOU SPEND EVERY DIME THAT THE COMMISSION WILL LET YOU SPEND ON SAFETY. BECAUSE IT WILL REDUCE POTENTIAL YOUR LIABILITY EVEN IF SOME OF THOSE INVESTMENTS ARE NOT VERY COST EFFECTIVE. IT'S NOT YOUR MONEY YOU DON'T CARE YOU'RE GONNA SPEND EVERY DIME HUMANLY POSSIBLE BECAUSE IT'S GREAT PAYER FUNDS. AND THAT'S STILL A HUGE ISSUE WE HAVE GOING FORWARD SO WE ALSO HAD A LOVELY CHAT WITH THE HELL OFFER LAST EVENING ABOUT THE BILL -- WE WERE FOR CLOSER TOGETHER WE APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT HE'S DOING TO TRY AND MOVE IN THIS DIRECTION. IT NEEDS TO MOVE A LOT FURTHER AYE THESE AREN'T THE ONLY ISSUES WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT WE'RE GOING TO BE TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WHO PAYS FOR THE EIGHTEEN BILLION DOLLARS IN LIABILITY THAT'S LIKELY TO COME OUT OF THE FIRES FROM LAST YEAR. AND SOME OF THAT AND UNFORTUNATELY IS PROBABLY ALSO GOING TO BE SHARED. BY CUSTOMERS AND OUR RATES ARE READY EXORBITANT THROUGH THE ROOF AND MUCH HIGHER THAN ANY CUSTOMERS FACE IN ANY OTHER STATE AND IN OUR SECTORS. THANK YOU. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DON GOBERT FOR THE CALIFORNIA COMMUNITY CHOICES SATIATION THE CCA'S. HOW WE HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR STAFF IN WITH YOU MISTER CHAIR AND YOUR STAFF? HOW FOR ALL ó WHILE TO TRY TO ADDRESS OUR TWO CONCERNS AND I AGREE WITH THE -- SENATOR DODD CHARACTERIZATION OF THE CCA AMENDMENT HERE WE DO APPRECIATE THAT IT IT IT MAINTAINS OBLIGATIONS AND AUTHORITIES. AND SO THAT GETS US 50% OF THE WAY THERE AND AGAIN VERY MUCH APPRECIATE THAT THE OTHER 50% IS RATE PAYER PROTECTION. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT UNDER THE BILL AS WE TALK TO THE AUTHOR AND THE STAFF IN PARTICULAR FOR WEEKS. ABOUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE BILL THAT THE RESOURCES PROCURED UNDER THE BILL -- WOULD NOT BE PROCURED BY. WE HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO DO BUT ALSO -- BY IT I'LL USE OF FOR I SAID FOR OUR CLIENTS FOR OUR RATE PAYERS. ALSO IOUS FOR INADVERTENTLY PERHAPS FOR OUR RATE PAYERS SO THAT THEY WOULD BE DOUBLE BILLED ALL WE WANT IS SOME LANGUAGE THAT WOULD CLARIFY THAT THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN. AND ACTUALLY -- WE WE DID DRAFT SOMETHING REAL QUICK IN RESPONSE TO WHAT WE SAW IN THE ANALYSIS TODAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

THAT -- WE ATTEMPT TO ADDRESS THE COR CONCERNS ARE HIGHLIGHTED TODAY WHICH IS THE EXTREME FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO MY CONSTITUENTS THAT ARE AS RATE PAYERS. AND I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE WORKING GROUP I KNOW THAT IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS BUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT MY MY CONSTITUENTS AND IF WE CAN -- ASSURE THAT THERE IS A BIPARTISAN GROUP AND A REAL -- COMMITMENT TO MAKING THIS WORK I WOULD BE HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT BUT AGAIN WITH THE UNDERSTANDING THAT THAT. WE ARE IT'S A WORK IN PROGRESS LIBYA UNDERSCORE HOW IMPORTANT THAT IS TO ME I HAVE MORE THAN A THOUSAND WINERIES IN MY DISTRICT. PLUS I COUNTLESS ACRES -- VINEYARDS ARE ALL IMPACTED THIS ANHEUSER BUSCH AND MANY MANY OTHER FACTORIES A BUSINESSES IS EQUALLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT WE GET THIS RIGHT AS WELL SO I APPRECIATE YOUR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE THAT [inaudible] IT'S GALLAGHER. SOONER DOT AYE I WANTED TO POINT OUT AGAIN THAT YOU KNOW THE BILL IS AND UTILITIES -- AND I APPRECIATE YOUR TAKING THIS ISSUE ON YOU KNOW AND AS AS PEOPLE -- REPRESENTATIVES FROM DISTRICTS THAT BOTH HAD FIRES RAVAGE THROUGH -- ARE DISTRICTS AND BURNED DOWN HOMES AND HAD AND WE'VE HAD LIVES LOST -- THE STATUS QUO. IS UNACCEPTABLE AND YOU KNOW SO. BUT ONE OF THINGS I DID WANT TO POINT OUT HERE IS THAT YOU KNOW. THE CURRENT PROCESS HE'S OBVIOUSLY AREN'T TAKING CARE OF THEM THEY MAY ADDRESS SAFETY -- BUT THEY NO I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE SATISFIED THE CURRENT PROCESS IS GOING TO TAKE CARE OF THESE ISSUES AND I THINK THAT'S REALLY AT THE HEART OF YOUR BILL IS THAT WE NEED TO SET -- THE BAR HIGHER -- FOR THE UTILITIES THAT THERE'S MORE THAN YOU DO THEY NEED APPROVED MINUTES -- AND THERE'S GOING TO BE A COST THAT THERE'S A COST ASSOCIATED WITH THAT. AND AND YOU KNOW -- AND THE OTHER PART OF IT WHEN I HEAR SAN HOME AND THE COSTS ARE SO HIGH WILL. THEY'RE NOT HIGH BECAUSE OF THIS YOU KNOW ME YES THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL COST BUT THE REAL REASON THEIR HIGHS BECAUSE OUR PS. AND BECAUSE OF AB THIRTY TWO IN THE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE ALONG THOSE LINES THAT'S WHY RATES ARE SO HIGH AND THAT'S WHY IT'S BEEN VERY DIFFICULT. OF FOR FOR MANY DIFFERENT BUSINESSES DEALING WITH THIS ISSUE -- BUT THE COST OF MAKING SURE THAT OUR SYSTEM IS SAFE AND THAT ARE. OUR HOMES OUR FAMILIES ARE SAFE IS SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD ALL BETTER NOW. WE'VE TALKED A LITTLE BIT MY CONCERN IS WITH THIS RECENT AMENDMENT IT SEEMS THE MAYBE SHIFT THE COST BURDEN -- TO ME I GUESS AND THE CASE OF MY CONSTITUENTS FROM. ONE OF MY CONSTITUENTS ONCE SAID A CONSTITUENTS MY BENEFIT OTHERS WOULD HAVE MORE THE COST SHIFTED TO THEM. NOW THIS IS ALL ONE BIG GRID THAT WE ALL BENEFIT FROM. YOU KNOW AND SO FOR ME. YOU KNOW I THINK THAT WE SHOULD ALL BE. YOU KNOW THEY'RE IN THE COSTS EQUALLY OF WHAT. WHAT IT TAKES TO MAKE THINGS SAFER -- AND YOU KNOW IN THE AND THERE ARE OTHER ISSUES THAT I'M CONCERNED ABOUT ABOUT HOW DO WE DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT THE UTILITY CAN PASS ACOSTA AFTER REPAIRS BUT WE YEAH I KNOW WE'RE GONNA CONTINUE WORK ON THOSE ISSUES BUT WITH THIS RECENT MEMBER THAT IS SOMETHING THAT DOES. GIVE ME CONCERNED I'D RATHER SEE MORE OF AN EQUAL. YOU LOOK WE ALL BENEFIT FROM HAVING THIS GRID AND AND MAYBE SHIP DONE ONLY A CERTAIN GROUP OF OF RATEPAYERS OVER OTHERS. DOES GIVE ME SOME PAUSE AND BUT YOU KNOW I WANT TO CONTINUE. TO TO WORK WITH YOU ON THAT ISSUE -- I GUESS AT THAT AMENDMENT IS TAKE MY LAYOFF TODAY AND BUT I'D LIKE TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON ON LANGUAGE. OBVIOUS IT'S SUPPORTED IT AND UTILITIES AND WANT TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOU ON THIS ISSUE. I'LL TAKE YOUR WORD MIGHT -- VERY SERIOUSLY [inaudible] MISS WALDRON. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR -- AS WE ALL ALL THE UTILITIES ARE CURRENTLY TAKING A BEARING A BIG BURDEN AFTER THE FACT IF TO FIRES HIT BOMB. THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY PART EXTREMELY IMPORTANT -- CRITICAL FOR AREAS LIKE MINE THAT YOU KNOW WHEN YOU'RE SOUTH OF THE GRAPEVINE AND IT'S YOU KNOW COASTAL SAGE AND JUST DRY BRUSH BASICALLY ESERT AREA HOME. WHEN THE SANTA ANA WINDS BLOW EVERYONE GETS SCARED I MEAN WE HAD THE CEDAR FIRE? AND THE WHICH FIRE WITH THIRTY SIX HUNDRED HOMES BURNED. THE DEVASTATING IT TOOK OVER A DECADE FROM PEOPLE WON'T GET THEIR LIVES TOGETHER. ON YOU KNOW I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS MY BUSINESS IS IMPACTED. WHEN I LOOK BACK IT'S LIKE WE'VE HAD [inaudible] PROBABLY. I OF FOUR FIVE MAJOR EVENTS OF THE LAST FOURTEEN YEARS IN MY AREA NOT COUNTING THE SMALL ONES -- WE JUST HAD THE LILAC FIRE THAT IMPACTS MY BUSINESS YOU KNOW WHEN THERE'S ASH ON THE GROUND IN SCHOOLS A CLOSING EVERYTHING THOUGH THOSE OF BIG ECONOMIC HITS [inaudible] SO. IT'S CRITICAL THAT WE CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT THIS I MEAN GATHERS ISSUES I THINK WE NEED TO KEEP THE DISCUSSION GOING OBVIOUSLY [inaudible] YOU KNOW. HAVING THE RATE PAYER PROTECTION AS USUAL IMPORTANT BUT I'LL BE LOOKING FOR YOU KNOW HASN'T MOVES FORWARD. ADOPTION OF STANDARDS FOR REDUCING THE RISK OF A MAJOR EVENT I LOOKAT YOU KNOW THE ST LOUIS RAY TRAINING CENTER THOROUGHBRED RACETRACK IN MY DISTRICT. FIFTY TWO THOROUGHBRED RACEHORSES DIED IN THE LILAC FIRE BECAUSE THEY COULDN'T GET OUT AND IT WAS ALL DUE TO FAN POMS. THAT ARE NEAR NON THEY'VE NON NATIVE THERE ARE. BASICALLY BLOWING OFF IN THE WIND LIKE TORCHES THOSE THINGS NEED TO BE WE GOTTA GET AHEAD OF THESE MAJOR EVENTS -- PREVENTING MULTI BILLION DOLLAR HITS ON THE SYSTEM GOING FORWARD. ON MIDDLE LONG RUN WE'RE GOING TO SAVE MONEY IS MY HOPE -- FOR HIGH A FIRE RISK AREAS WE NEED TO KEEP THE DISCUSSION MOVING. ARM WE CAN AFFORD TO PUT IT ASIDE WAY FOR THE NEXT FIRE SEASON THE COM. I THINK YOU KNOW IT'S REALLY CRITICAL FOR A STATE FOR THE RATE PAYERS FOR A BUSINESS. THAT WE GET THIS ISSUE SOLVED THANK YOU. YOU'RE THE MOST LEVINE THE MISTER GORE. I CAN ASSURE MISTER I THINK -- FOR PRESENTING THIS BILL I KNOW THAT YOU'VE GOT THE VERY BEST INTENTIONS FOR OUR COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFERED -- AND ALSO LOOKING FORWARD FOR ALL OF CALIFORNIA SO THANK YOU FOR THAT ALL OF THE EFFORT THAT YOU HAVE HERE. I DO HAVE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN EXPRESSED ABOUT THE POTENTIAL NEGATIVE IMPACT -- THAT THIS COULD HAVE ON UTILITY RATE PAYERS AND OF PARTICULAR CONCERN -- THAT WAS NOTED IN UTILITIES AND ENERGY COMMITTEE BILL ANALYSIS OUT WHERE THEY MADE THE POINT THAT THIS BILL WOULD SUPPLANT THE CPU SEES CURRENT REVIEW. TO DETERMINE WHETHER UTILITY ACTED REASONABLY OR IS A PRUDENT MANAGER AFTER A FIRE HAS OCCURRED. INSTEAD THE CPC WOULD BASIS DECISION ON WHETHER UTILITY WAS IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. WITH ITS FILED AN APPROVED SAFETY RELIABILITY AND RESILIENCY PLAN. AS ESTABLISHED BY THIS BILL THAT -- THAT YOU'VE AUTHORED AND THE CONCERN IS THAT THIS COULD SUBJECT RATEPAYERS TO EXTENSIVE LIABILITY COSTS [inaudible] MOREOVER ON NUMEROUS CPC DETERMINATIONS WOULD BE MADE ON AN EXPEDITED BASIS WITH LIMITED EVIDENCE [inaudible] UNLIKE. A GENERAL RATE CASE PROCEEDED TO COMMENT ON THAT PLEASE. I'M A SECURE JOB MY WITNESS THAT RESPOND TO THAT CERTAINLY. THANK YOU MISTER LANE -- THE ANALYSIS THAT YOU'RE REFERRING TO OVERLOOKED -- ONE SENTENCE THAT'S IN THE BILL ALREADY WITH RESPECT TO AFTER THE FACT FACTUAL ANALYSIS. WHICH THE ANALYSIS SUGGESTED WOULDN'T HAPPEN -- IN FACT IN -- SECTION TWENTY EIGHT NINETY NINE POINT FOUR WHICH IS ON PAGE FOURTEEN OF THE BILL. IN LINE'S FOUR THROUGH SIX SAYS THE COMMISSION SHALL CONDUCT AN ANNUAL PROCEEDING. TO REVIEW EACH UTILITIES COMPLIANCE WITH ITS PLAN INCLUDING. A FACTUAL ANALYSIS OF ANY MAJOR EVENTS THAT OCCURRED SO [inaudible] IT'S IT WILL STILL BE THE CASE AT THE COMMISSION WILL DO IT AFTER THE FACT REVIEW IF SOMETHING HAPPENED TO DETERMINE. WHETHER THE AGILITY COMPLY WITH THIS PLAN ON ONE HAND OR WAS NEGLIGENT ON THE OTHER. SO THAT'S NOT BEING TAKEN OUT OF OF THE PROCESS THAT'S SPECIFICALLY CALLED OUT AS SOMETHING THAT WILL OCCUR -- AND THE SECOND QUESTION YOU ASKED WAS ABOUT. BUT I'M I I WANT TO BE. REALLY FOCUSED ON THE CHANGE IN. OUR WHAT COMPLIANCE MEANS WHO WHAT THAT'S HIM THAT IMPACT MIGHT END UP BEING FOR RATEPAYERS I THINK THAT'S WHAT A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE. PRETTY PRETTY BROAD CONCERNS ABOUT. YES AND AND THAT'S WE WE'VE HEARD THOSE CONCERNS AND THERE'S BEEN A NUMBER OF AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO ADDRESS IT. THE LAST SET OF AMENDMENTS WHICH ARE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS BEING OFFERED IN THIS COMMITTEE -- WHICH ARE AT THE VERY END OF THE BILL [inaudible] SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIM ANY INTENT THE EXISTING UTILITY LIABILITY FOR NEGLIGENCE IF THEY ARE NEGLIGENT THEN THIS BILL DOES NOT PROTECT THEM MOREOVER SENATOR HILL -- WHO IS PATIENTLY WAITING TO PRESENT ONE OF HIS BILLS NOT THIS ONE SENATOR HILL HAS A BILL WHICH ALSO EXPLICITLY PROHIBITS? ANY RECOVER AND RECOVERY. FOR NEGLIGENCE AND SENATOR DODD IS A COAUTHOR THAT BILL [inaudible] SO. WHY UNDERSTAND THE CONCERNS EXPRESSED BY THE RATE PER GROUPS WE'VE? TAKE A LOT OF AMENDMENTS TO TRY TO BE SURE THEIR FEARS ARE NOT REALIZED ANSWER DOES THAT -- ALSO RELATED EXPEDITED BASIS AND A LIMITATION ON EVIDENCE. THERE IS NO LIMITATION THAT EVIDENCE THE RATE CASE PLAN. PROCEEDING -- WE'VE TAKEN A MEMBERS TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS THE FACT THAT THAT PROCEEDING WILL BE A FULL BLOWN PROCEEDING -- IT CAN TAKE AS LONG AS THE COMMISSION NEEDS TO TAKE WE THERE WERE CONCERNS ABOUT IT BEING EXPLAINED TO COMPRESSED. WE TOOK AMENDMENTS TO SAY WE WOULD LIKE TO HAVE IT BE DONE IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS BUT THEY CAN'T FINISH IN EIGHTEEN MONTHS TAKE AS LONG AS YOU NEED TO STEP BIG MAKE A FINDING THAT ANY LONGER. THAT'S EXACTLY THE SAME REQUIREMENT THAT EXISTS AT ANY RATE CASE RIGHT NOW. I WILL THINK YOU I SEE THAT ONE OF THE OTHER WITNESSES THAT PROVIDED TESTIMONY HAS A COMMENT ON THE IF I IF THE CHAIR DOESN'T MIND. I'M FROM MINISTER. GOOD THANK YOU -- GONNA NOT YOUR HANDS BEHALF OF TERMS -- ON YOUR QUESTION REGARDING -- THE CURRENT PROCESS PROCESS AND HOW THE BILL IS CHANGING IT. THE THE PROPONENT A WITNESS JUST STATED ABOUT THE NEGLIGENCE. PIECE THAT IS IN THE AMENDMENTS. THE USE OF THE WORD NEGLIGENCE MEANS THAT THAT PROVISION THAT LINE ONLY APPLIES TO THE COURT PROCEEDING IT DOES NOT TOUCH. THE CPUC PROCEEDING SO LET ME JUST BE CLEAR IT SAYS WHERE WHERE. UTILITIES FOUND NEGLIGENT AND IT CAN BE PASSED ON THAT NEGLIGENCE FINALLY CAN FIND CAN ONLY OCCUR IN COURT AND MOST OF THESE CASES. MOST THE LITIGATION THERE SETTLED OUT OF COURT THERE IS NO FINDING OF NEGLIGENCE OR OR NON A BUDGETS. THE THE KEY THING ON YES THIS BILL DOES REQUIRE A REVIEW OF A MAJOR OF IT THAT IS TRUE DIFFERENCE IS THAT THE COMMISSION. DETERMINATION WOULD NO LONGER BE ABOUT ALL OF THE FACTS RELATED TO THE MAJOR EVENT IT WOULD ONLY BE ON THE QUESTION WAS THE PLAN SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLIED WITH THAT IS THE MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN A FIVE VERY BRIEFLY CAN JUST GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE THAT SOMEONE REYES TO ME I'VE BEEN. USING. THE PLAN REQUIRES THAT A MILLION TREES ARE CUT BACK. FURTHER IF FURTHER CLEARANCE FROM POWERLINES. AND UTILITY CUT BACK. ALL BUT THREE WOULDN'T THAT. THAT WOULD BE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE SOMEBODY WOULD ARGUE AND SAY THEY SHOULD NOT BE LIABLE. BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN THEY ARE GOING TO HURT. THE DIFFERENCE WITH THIS BILL IS THAT HER CURRENT LAW. THAT MAY BE TRUE HOWEVER IF YOU LOOK AT ALL THE FACTS WHAT IF. THE UTILITY WAS RECEIVING CALLS FOR CONSUMERS FOR TWO WEEKS STRAIGHT. THAT THOSE THREE TREES THAT THEY HADN'T CUT BACK. WERE SPARKING FIRES. AND THEY DID NOTHING ABOUT IT. UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT FACT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BY THE CPUC. UNDER THIS BILL THAT FACT WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED IT WOULD ONLY BE CONSIDERING WHETHER OR NOT THEY'RE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE AND ONE WOULD ARGUE THAT. THREE TREES OUT OF A MILLION MIGHT BE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE. BUT IT CERTAINLY WOULDN'T TAKE THEM AWAY FROM BEING IMPRUDENT BY NOT RESPONDING TO TWO WEEKS OF CALLS ARE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE THREE TREES AND THAT'S A MAJOR DIFFERENCE. ARE YOU LOOK AT ALL THE FACTS AND MAKE A DETERMINATION OF LIABILITY. IS CURRENT PROCESS ARE YOU GONNA LOOK AT STATURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE PLAN AND THAT'S IT. NOT AT THIS BILL DOES AND HOPEFULLY THAT HELPS. I THINK YOU ARE AND WHAT THE COMMITTEE DOES. TO IS THE WRONG TERM THESE BUT TO SUFFER. GOING THROUGH THIS VERY GOING BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN THE TWO DIFFERENT SIDES OF THIS IS. I TO USE THE SAME TERMED A SUBSTANTIAL ISSUE -- IN PRE MEDIA FOR FOR THAT ISSUE THAT WERE WERE TRYING TO DEAL% WITH. OUT MR DOT IS THERE I'M NOT ASKING YOU TO MAKE A CHANGE ARE TAKEN AMENDMENT BUT I MEAN HOW HOW DO YOU THINK YOU COULD -- TRY TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE OR IS THIS DEFINITION IN THIS THIS PART OF YOUR BILL SOMETHING THAT IS MISINTERPRETED OR IT'S NOT MISINTERPRETED IT YOU JUST CAN'T CHANGE WITH WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH THIS ACTUALLY ACCOMPLISHING A LOT. WITH A LOT OF THE OTHER STUFF IN YOUR BILL THAT'S VERY GOOD -- BUT THIS MIGHT BE A BIT TOO MUCH. I I I I I HEAR BOTH SIDES HERE AND I'LL TELL YOU. IF WHAT IT TAKES IS TO FIND ANOTHER WORD BESIDES NEGLIGENCE I DON'T NECESSARILY AGREE WITH THE WITNESS -- FOR YA FROM TURN BAD -- RESPECT HIM AND AND EXPERIENCE THAT HE HAS. SO THAT MAYBE SOMETHING THAT WE THAT'S NOT MAYBE SUBWAY NEED TO LOOK AT WE WILL LOOK AT THAT I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT. WILL LOOK AT THAT WITH THE WORKING THE ASSEMBLY WORKING GROUP. I THINK THAT'S YET THAT'S VERY FAIR I THINK WE ALSO NEED TO HAVE AN HONEST ARBITER -- THAT'S SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE TWO TWO ADDRESSED. THE THE ISSUE THAT'S BEFORE US BEFORE WE BRING IT -- TO APPROPRIATIONS PERHAPS OR MOST CERTAINLY THE ASSEMBLY FLOOR AYE SO YOU HAVE A LOT OF BILL HERE EVEN IF YOU. DO NOT INCLUDE THIS SECTION OF THE BILL. BUT THAT DOES A LOT OF GOOD I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT POINT. ON I ALSO TRUST THAT YOU'LL WORK OUT THE CCA ISSUE I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT'S TOTALLY DOABLE I KNOW THAT YOU'VE YOU'RE COMMITTED TO IT -- YOU KNOW I I AM JUST REALLY TORN ON THIS BUT I WILL EXTEND THE COURTESY VOTE TO YOU. I DON'T KNOW HOW I WILL VOTE ON IT ON THE FLOOR. I HOPE THAT YOU RESOLVE THIS ISSUE OR DELETE THAT PROVISION THAT CAUSES A LOT OF CONSTERNATION ABOUT A FIFTEEN OF THE COST. TO RATEPAYERS AND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING THAT EVERYONE WHO WE REPRESENT SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THANK YOU THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER. WHICH GLORIA. THINKING IS CHAIRMAN JUST VERY QUICKLY SAID ABOUT THANK YOU FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL AND FOR YOUR WILLINGNESS TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDING COMMENTS HE JUST MADE. A ABOUT A QUICK APPORTIONMENT OF A OF LIABILITY I JUST WANT TO SHARE I APPRECIATE THE WORK THAT'S BEEN DONE TO IT BASICALLY BEHALF ALL OF THAT CCA'S ARE LOOKING AT I NEED YOU TO HEAR FROM ME THAT MY COMMUNITIES MOST OF THE CITIES IN MY DISTRICT ARE WORKING. TO ESTABLISH CCA'S AS WE SPEAK AND IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THAT PROCESS IS SUCCESSFUL IN THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN BE GIVEN CHOICE WHETHER TO STAY WITH THE LEGACY UTILITY OR MOVE ON I KNOW THAT THIS COULD POTENTIALLY OR WHAT I'M TOLD BY. THAT WOULD BE PUT TROUBLESOME FOR ME OF FOR FOR THEIR SUPPORT -- BUT I APPRECIATE AT THE TABLE HOPE THAT YOU GET THE READ THE FULL OF OF FOR CCA'S TO MAKE SURE THAT MY COMMUNITY CAN HAVE THE CHOICE THEY'RE SEEKING RIGHT NOW. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. MISTERBERMAN. FOR YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR -- AND SENATOR DODD I'LL JUST QUICKLY ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH A LOT THAT WERE MADE PRIOR TO ME -- IN PARTICULAR ON THE CCA'S YOU CITY IS THE OTHER 5% IS GOVERNED BY MUNICIPALLY OWNED UTILITY -- SO IF THAT CAN'T GET WORKED OUT THEN I WON'T BE ABLE TO SUPPORT THE BILL MOVING FORWARD -- I'M WILLING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY -- AND LOOK FORWARD TO SEEING WHAT YOU WORKOUT ON THAT AS WELL AS ON THE RATE PAYER A CONCERNS THAT WERE EXPRESSED BY ONE OF MY COLLEAGUES AND AND YOU'RE HOPEFULLY EVEN. ONCE THEN RESULT IS HAS BEEN IMPROVED ALL HAVE IT -- THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT IT AGAIN MOVING FORWARD THINK HE'S MISTER COOLEY. I'VE GOT QUESTIONS REGARDING THE AMENDMENTS BUT MY GENERAL VIEW IN THIS AREA I THINK IS THAT THE PUBLIC. WILL GO ALONG WITH SAFETY IF THEY FEEL THERE'S A REASONABLE SHARON OF THE PAIN. I'M CONCERNED THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS ARE NOT NECESSARILY. ON THE HOOK. EVEN NO THEY MAKE THE INVESTMENT THEY STAND TO GAIN BASED ON THEIR INVESTMENT -- I'M A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT WHERE WE'RE PUTTING RATES THAT THE RATE STRUCTURE OTHER RATEPAYERS. BUT THE SHAREHOLDER SORT OF OUR ENSLAVED FROM THE OFFICE SUITE DEAL IF YOU'RE A SHAREHOLDER HERE. YOU GENERALLY YOU PUT UP YOUR CAPITAL YOU TAKE YOUR RISK AND YOU GET A RETURN. AND HERE THIS WOULD BE REMOVING NAY. HUGE RISK COMPONENT FROM THAT CAPITAL INVESTMENT BY SHAREHOLDER. AND ARM IN GENERAL I THINK THAT. THE REVIEWS BY THE PUBLIC WOULD BE SKATING. IF THEY SEE THEIR RATES GOING UP AND IT COMES OUT THAT THE SHAREHOLDERS WERE SORT OF INSULATED FROM SHARON THAT. AND THEN SIDE JUST A GENERALIZED OBSERVATION THAT GIVES ME SOME CONCERN HERE. THE MORE PARTICULAR THING IS I READ THE ANALYSIS AND THE ACCORDING TO YOU WHEN YOU ANY COMMITTEE ANALYSIS JUST LAST DECEMBER A P. YOU SEE PROCESS COMPLETED ITSELF [inaudible] ESTABLISHING -- A STATE WIDE MAP OF HIGH FLYER THREAT DISTRICTS HF TD'S. WHICH TRIED TO LOOK AT THE STATE AND SYSTEMATIC WAY I GUESS AND IDENTIFY WHERE THE HIGH FIRE THREAT AREAS. THIS IS SIX MONTHS OLD THIS BODY OF WORK. WHICH WOULD SEEM TO SAY THERE ARE SOME JUST SOME EFFORT TO KINDA LOOK AROUND CALIFORNIA C. WORST DROUGHT HIGH WEARS LOW. AS I READ THE AUTHOR'S AMENDMENT NUMBER. ONE THE SUMMARY PROVIDE THE CPUC SHOW CONSIDERADA CAN ACOSTA PROPORTION THE BENEFITS OF SOME PAGES ANALYSIS. TO EACH RATE CLASS AND CLIMATE REGION. IN WHICH YOU PROVE INVESTORS PREMADE. AND AND THAT PHRASE CLIMATE ZONE APPEARS IN THE AMENDMENT THIS PROPOSER NUMBER. ONE I UNDERSTAND WHAT CLIMATE ZONES REFERRING TO AND DOES THAT BEAR A RELATIONSHIP. TO THE P. UC'S WORK ON HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS. I I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT THE CLIMATE ZONE MEANS. IN RELATION TO THE EXISTING WORK. JEFF YESTERDAY ABOUT WHAT IS THAT THE THIS DIRECTION ONE WHO ARE ADDRESS THE BUT THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE HIGH FIRE THROUGHOUT [inaudible] DISTRICTS. OKAY MISTER CHAIR IF I CAN RESPOND TO THAT QUESTION -- ASSEMBLYMEMBER COOLEY. THE COMMISSION ALREADY USES A SET OF CLIMATE ZONES. SEC BASELINE RATES -- AND THERE BECAUSE YOU KNOW SOME AREAS THE STATE ARE HARDER THAN OTHERS SOME AREAS A COOLER THEY HAVE DIFFERENT WEATHER. AND SO TO SET A BASELINE USAGE RATES THE COMMISSION HAS A SERIES OF CLIMATE ZONES AND SO WE AND WE SPECIFICALLY AND INTENTIONALLY ADOPTED. AN EXISTING STRUCTURE SO THAT WE WOULDN'T BE INVENTING ANY NEW WE ALSO WOULDN'T CRANNY THE ADDITIONAL UNCERTAINTY OR ADMINISTRATIVE BURDEN. AND IT BE USING SOMETHING THAT. EVERYBODY AT THE P. YOU SEEN KNOWS WHAT IT MEANS -- AND THEY ARE RELEVANT -- TO THE DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IN THE STATE. HOUSES CORRESPOND TO THE HIGH FIRE THREAT DISTRICTS TO NEW WORK OF THE P. UC -- IT THE REALITY IS THAT WOULD SEEM TO RELATE TO THE COST IF YOU YES FOR SURE -- AND WHAT WE SAW WITH THE NEW MAPS IS AN AWFUL LOT OF THE STATE IS A HIGH FIRE RISKS KNOWN AT THIS POINT -- AND SO MOST OF THE CLIMATE ZONES WILL PROBABLY HAVE HIGH FIRE RISK IN THEM -- THAT'S THE REALITY WE FACE RIGHT NOW. THAT DOESN'T MEAN THEY HAVE -- EQUAL RISK OR THE COST SHOULD BE SHARED EQUALLY OR INVESTMENT SHOULD BE SHARED EQUALLY. BUT PART OF THE AMENDMENT THAT WAS PROPOSED TODAY. IS TO CORRELATE WHERE THE INVESTMENTS ARE MADE -- WITH WHO'S PAYING FOR THEM SO THAT PEOPLE HAVE A REAL CLOSE RELATIONSHIP. AND AS YOU SAID IN A PEOPLE GOING TO PAY FOR SAFETY THAT ARE GETTING -- AND WE WANTED. CAPITALIZE ON THE FACT CABLE [inaudible] ON IF YOU [inaudible] WHICH KILEY. I WANTED TO GET A LITTLE MORE CLARITY ON THIS DISPUTE OVER THE LIABILITY STANDARD SO WE HEARD FROM THE PROPONENTS THAT THEY'RE STILL GONNA BE A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD AYE IN COURT AND THE RESPONSE FROM THE WITNESS -- FROM TURN IS THAT -- MOST OF THOSE CASES OF COURSE THAT'S TRUE KIND OF IN ANY KIND OF LITIGATION AND I YOU KNOW THE THE LIABILITY STANDARD AT PARIS ON NOT ON THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT SO. COULD YOU JUST MAKE IT A LITTLE MORE I STILL MORE EXPLICITLY WHY YOU THINK THAT HAVING AYE AYE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD IN -- IN THE CONTEXT OF A COURT PROCEEDING AS OPPOSED TO A CPUC PROCEEDING IS IN A SUFFICIENTLY -- POWERFUL LEVER TO INDUCE -- EFFICIENCY IF YOU MEASURES IF YOU. IF I MAY UM FINDER SENATE THE QUESTION I DON'T. KNOW THAT WOULD MAKE A STATEMENT AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD SHOULD BE. CHANGED OR THE USE OF THE NEGLIGENCE STANDARD SHOULD BE CHANGED I THINK MY COMMENT WAS THAT AT LEAST UNDER CURRENT LAW. THERE'S A NEGLIGENCE STANDARD THAT. CAN BE USED IN COURT BUT IF THE CPC THE STANDARD IS -- IS -- ONE OF PRUDENCE. WHETHER YOU TO ACT PRUDENTLY OR NOT AND SELL MY REFERENCE THE WORD NEGLIGENCE IN THE PROPOSED AMENDMENTS. WAS THAT THE IMPACT OF THAT AMENDMENT WOULD ONLY BE ON IN COURT LITIGATION AS OPPOSED TO IS THE PRECEDING THE CPUC. AND MISTER CHAIR IF I COULD -- RESPOND TO THAT. THE COMMISSION FINDS NEGLIGENCE. ALL THE TIME. EDISON WAS FOUND NEGLIGENT FOR ITS HANDLING OF THE SENATE KNOW FREE -- STEAM GENERATOR FAILURE. P. GINNY WAS FOUND NEGLIGENT BY THE PC FOR THE EXPLOSION IN SAN BRUNO. SO IT'S SIMPLY NOT THE CASE THAT NEGLIGENCE REFERS ONLY TO A COURT PROCEEDING IT'S SOMETHING THE COMMISSION DOES AND HAS DONE IN THE PAST AND YOU KNOW IF NECESSARY I PRESUME WILL CONTINUE TO DO IN THE FUTURE SO THE THAT. DICHOTOMY THAT'S BEEN PRESENTED HERE JUST IS NOT ACCURATE MISTER CHAIRMAN IF IT ENDED IN ADDITION TO THAT THE EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN EARLIER BY THE TURN. WITNESS STATING THAT IF. THE UTILITY HAD BEEN NOTIFIED THAT THERE WAS A PARKING POWER LINE AND THEY DID NOTHING THAT THIS BILL WOULD EXEMPT THEM. I WOULD BRING YOUR ATTENTION TO PAGE. FIFTEEN LINES FIVE THROUGH SIX WHAT SPECIFICALLY STATES THAT ONE OF THE DISQUALIFIER SO UTILITY. WOULD BE IF THEY HAD ADVANCE NOTICE OF THE CIRCUMSTANCES CAN CONSTITUTING NONCOMPLIANCE. SO THE EXAMPLE EGGS THE IDENTICAL EXAMPLE THAT WAS GIVEN IS EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED IN THE BILL [inaudible] BIGELOW. NOW WE'VE TALKED IN. TRY TO RESOLVE A I ONLY SIR ONE OF THOSE [inaudible] YOUR COMMITMENT [inaudible] HERE. FOR IF YOU'RE WILLING. TO CAN YOU THAT WORK AS YOU AGREED TWO AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF ISSUE FORTY TAKEN INTO YOUR BILL. FROM PART OF THAT WORKING GROUP ON THIS PERKS -- COMMENTS AND SUGGESTIONS FROM HER BILL IS THAT IT DOES HAVE BEEN AGREED TO AND YOU'VE TAKEN THOSE. AT THIS TIME OR YOU'RE ABOUT TO TAKE THOSE ABOUT THE AUTHORS AMENDMENTS -- THAT I HAVE READ INCORPORATE THOSE. AND I COMMIT YOU HAVE MY COMMITMENT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH A GROUP TO AND AND MANY OF THEM MAKE THE BILL BETTER MANY OF THOSE -- REFINEMENTS HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY -- THAT IT OR SO SOLIDIFIED. WITH EVERYONE AT THIS POINT YOU HAVE A COMMITMENT. ARE YOU OR WOULD YOU MAKE A COMMITMENT TO MAKE SURE TO THE OTHER MEMBERS WHO HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY -- APPRISED OF ALL OF THOSE THAT YOU'RE GOING TO CONTINUE. DIRECTLY WORKING WITH THOSE COMMITTEES MEMBERS. LOOK I WANT TO WORK WITH EVERYBODY THAT WALKS YOU KNOW THAT THEY ARE NOT REALLY AWARE OF TO ASSEMBLY WORKING GROUPS ARE THAT THERE WAS THERE WAS A HOLDING GROUP AND THERE WAS THE BURKE. SO WE HAD TO THEIR THEM MOVING FORWARD -- IT WITH RESPECT TO THAT -- IS THERE ALSO AN EXPRESSED COULD COMMITMENT THAT IF THIS BILL. FACE IS CONTINUAL ONSLAUGHT FACES WHAT IF IT CONTINUES TO FACE CONTINUE ONSLAUGHT. THERE'S A WILLINGNESS ON YOUR PART TO STAND DOWN ON THIS BILL. WOULD YOU BE WILLING TO DO THAT SO THAT WE COULD TAKE IT UP AT THE BEGINNING OF NEXT YEAR. YOU KNOW I'M NOT GONNA. LET ORIGIN TO ANOTHER TO MAKE THAT COMMIT UP COMMITMENT HERE TODAY -- THAT MAYBE SOMETHING THAT I'M GONNA BE ASKED TO DO BY -- THE COMMITTEE. IF THE BIPARTISAN COMMITTEE -- YOU KNOW WHO OF BURKE AND AND FLORA -- WORD TO OPINE AND THAT -- IN THAT FASHION I WOULD TAKE THAT VERY SERIOUSLY AND WE'LL BE TO SAVE THAT IF THAT'S WHAT THEY WANTED ME TO DO ON THAT I WOULD YEAH OKAY. THAT'S THE DIFFERENCE BECAUSE I'M NOT GONNA SPEAK FOR MY OTHER FELLOW MEMBERS HERE -- BUT THAT WOULD BE THE DIFFERENCE FOR ME. BECAUSE I I'VE TAKEN IS VERY SERIOUS COMMITTED A GREAT DEAL OF MY TIME A STEP BY. INTO WORKING WITH EVERYONE AND I'M WILLING. TO WALK DOWN THE ROAD A LITTLE FARTHER WITH YOU. AND HELP MAKE THIS HAPPEN. SO WE CAN HAVE A REASONABLE AND RESPONSIBLE SAID A SOLUTIONS. I WANT TO MAKE SURE SO ALSO TAKE THAT AS A COMMITMENT FROM THE UK AND I'LL TAKE THAT. AND I WORK WITH THE IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO GET THIS PACKAGE DONE AND RIGHT JUST WAY. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER. ANY ADDITIONAL OUR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS SENATOR ALL. CLOSED OUT FOR YOU THEN AND A COUPLE COMMENTS -- ONE I APPRECIATE -- THE OFFICE AMENDMENTS YOU BROUGHT FORWARD HERE AND I APPRECIATE THE MANNER WHICH YOU APPROACH THIS ISSUE CLEARLY THERE SEVERAL PIECES OF LEGISLATION WORKING THEIR WAY THROUGH OUR PROCESS. ARE THIS IS A LARGE AND COMPLICATED ISSUE -- AS IT PERTAINS TO THE DISCUSSION WE JUST HAD HERE TODAY COMMITTEE IT'S ALSO ISSUE WHERE WE'RE NOT SHORT ON HYPOCRISY AT TIMES. ARE THERE RETIREMENT COST CONTAINMENT WE TALK ABOUT -- SAFETY -- WHEN IT COMES? TO POTENTIALLY SHIFTING LIABILITY FROM. SHAREHOLDERS TERROR RATEPAYERS BICU TO REFORM NETWORK AND OTHERS ARE FIRST IN LINE TO RAISE THOSE CONCERNS. WHEN IT COMES TO SHIFTING? HYDRO COULD COST UNDER. CENTRAL VALLEY FOLKS THERE ABSENT -- THERE ARE COST SHIPS ALL OVER. UTILITY POLICY AND AND YOU'VE GOT A COMPLICATED -- OBJECTIVE IN TRYING TO ADDRESS THE VARYING INTERESTS OF THE MANY MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE HERE MISTER GALLAGHER AND I BOTH SHARE A LARGER CULTURAL COMMUNITIES -- I WOULD POINT. YOU KNOW TO HIS COMMENTS ABOUT SHIFTING COST BURDEN ON SAFETY -- TO SHIFTING COST BURDEN TO THOSE OF US THAT LIVE IN LESS TEMPERATE CLIMATES. RIGHT IF I BUILD MY HOUSE IN A HIGH RISK FIRE [inaudible] DISTRICT -- EVERYBODY SHOULD SHARE IN THE COST IF I BUILT MY HOUSE IN A HOT CLIMATE -- ONLY I SHOULD BEAR THE COST. THOSE ARE NOT EQUITABLE. OTHER AND INTELLECTUALLY CONSISTENT POLICY OBJECTIVES AND I THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON THAT WHAT I ALSO THINK WE CAN ALL AGREE ON IS THAT SAFETY. AND COST CONTAINMENT NEED TO BE THE PRIORITIES -- OVERALL I THINK FROM ALL SIDES ON HOW WE BALANCE THAT COMMITS pDIFFICULT OBJECTIVE -- I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE MOVE FORWARD I THINK THE COMMITTEE I AS A WHOLE THROUGH THEIR COMMENTS. INDICATES ITS REPORT WE MOVE FORWARD WITH. A AND I TO SAFETY BUT THAT WE CONTINUE TO HAVE THIS DIALOGUE ON TOP SHIPS AND CONTAINMENT AND SO ON AND SO FORTH. SO I APPRECIATE THE WAY DON'T APPRECIATE YOUR COMMITMENTS TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE -- THAT YOU CONTINUE TO MAKE AMENDMENTS CLEARLY AS THIS BILL CAME OUT A PREVIOUS COMMITTEES WORK WASN'T FULLY DOWN AND YOU CONTINUE THAT WORKS I APPRECIATE THAT. AND THEY WILL HAVE A AYE RECOMMENDATION FROM ME WILL KEEP AN EYE -- ON THIS BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD AS WELL AS OTHER PIECE OF LEGISLATION AS WELL AS OUR COLLECTIVE INTERACTION WITH THE WORKING GROUPS ON THE OTHER COMMITTEE JURISDICTIONS AND COMMITTEES THAT ARE WORKING ON THIS TOPIC. AND HOPEFULLY WE CAN COME TO A CONCLUSION THAT IS MORE INTELLECTUALLY CONSISTENT AND LESS HYPOCRITICAL THAT OUR CURRENT ENERGY POLICY TODAY. WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND THIS IS TO PASS AS AMENDED APPROPRIATIONS SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL GREG AYE GRAY AYE BIGELOW. BIGELOW AYE ACOSTA. SO THEY ARE OCCURRING. AGUIAR-CURRY I BERMAN.

OKAY WE'RE GOING TO BEGIN. ON THE LEFT OVER HERE AND WILL MOVE TO OUR RIGHT SO PROCEED WITH YOUR TESTIMONY SIR. A GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS FROM ON COST OF AUNT PROFESSOR SAN FRANCISCO STATE UNIVERSITY. I'M HERE TO TESTIFY THAT -- WE ARE -- PRESENTED WITH WHAT IS A GOLD STANDARD IN RESEARCH IN TERMS OF WHAT THE IMPACT OF THIS BILL WILL BE. THIS BILL -- WILL LEAD TO INCREASED HARM BOTH IN TERMS OF CAR WRECKS -- AND ALL ALL OTHER REALLY OR TYPES OF HARMS -- THIS WAS FOUND BY THE CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL THEY USE THE HIGHEST STANDARDS THE COULD BE USED FOR RESEARCH ON WHAT THE IMPACT WOULD BE OF KEEPING BARS OPEN AN EXTRA TWO HOURS. THEY LOOKED AT EVERY MAJOR STUDY THAT HAVE BEEN DONE THAT SO THEY COULD POSSIBLY CONSIDER AND WHAT THEY FOUND CONCLUSIVELY IS THAT KEEPING THE BARS OPEN ANOTHER TWO HOURS WILL HARM. THE COMMUNITIES BOTH IN AND NEAR OF WHERE THOSE PARTS ARE KEPT OPEN. NOW I UNDERSTAND THAT THIS COMMITTEE IS PURSUE PRESENT IN THE PAST WITH -- A PIECE OF PAPER -- THAT SHOWED THE HOURS TO CERTAIN STATES HAVE FOR OUR HOW LONG THEIR BAR STAY OPEN AND THE RATE OF ALCOHOL RELATED CAR CRASHES. A THAT IS NOT RESEARCH AT ALL THAT DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY KIND OF EVIDENCE THAT -- THERE IS NO HARM THE MATTER IS VERY COMPLICATED THERE ARE MANY FACTORS THAT EX THAT AFFECT HOW ALCOHOL KEEPING BARS OPEN AFFECTS THE PUBLIC HEALTH. OF ITS NOT JUST THE BARS AT IT IN THE STATES THAT WE ARE BEING COMPARED TO THEY COULD HAVE DIFFERENT PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION SYSTEMS THEY COULD HAVE -- DIFFERENT LAW ENFORCEMENT SYSTEMS THEY COULD HAVE DIFFERENT SPEED LIMITS THE COULD HAVE DIFFERENT LAWS ABOUT USING DRUGS THERE'S ALL KINDS OF THINGS THAT AFFECT THE STATE'S RATE OF ALCOHOL RELATED CAR CRASHES. A BILL THAT SIMPLY COMPARES OR A PIECE OF PAPER THAT SIMPLY -- SHOWS THE CAR CRASHES IN THE STATE AND THE ALCOHOL -- THE LOSSES NOW LAKE MARS COULD STAY OPEN DOESN'T SHOW YOU ANYTHING AT ALL YOU HAVE SOLID EVIDENCE FROM THE CDC FROM THE HIGHEST RESEARCH YOU COULD POSSIBLY HAVE. THIS BILL WILL COST LIVES. HI DOCTOR MARK HORTON -- I'M. THE CHAIR AND OTHER HONORABLE MEMBERS OF THE OF OF THE COMMITTEE -- I'M A PEDIATRICIAN FORMER HEALTH COUNTY OF ORANGE AND A FORMER STATE HEALTH OFFICER AND DIRECTOR OF THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH ON HERE. TESTIFYING ON BEHALF OF THE SIXTY ONE OPPOSITION A LOCAL HEALTH OFFICER MEMBERS OF THE HEALTH A HEALTH OFFICERS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA AND THE HUNDREDS OF PUBLIC HEALTH PROFESSIONAL MEMBERS. OF THE CALIFORNIA PUBLIC HEALTH ASSOCIATION NORTH A PUBLIC HEALTH ROLE VIS A VIS THE PUBLIC POLICY DEVELOPMENT IS TO CAREFULLY REVIEW THE SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE ALLOWING US TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT. ON THE CITIZENS OF CHANGES TO PUBLIC POLICY BEING PROPOSED THROUGH LEGISLATION AND TO ENSURE THAT YOU S. LEGISLATORS HAVE THE FACTS BEFORE MAKING A DECISION. THE POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACT OF NINE OH FIVE IS CLEAR. OVER FORTY YEARS OF PEER REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC DATA CONFIRMS THAT EXTENDING ALCOHOL SALES TO FOUR AM WOULD MEAN MORE INTOXICATED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD. MORE DO YOU AYE CRASHES MORE PERSONAL INJURIES ER VISITS MORE DEATHS MORE VIOLENT CRIME. THIS HEALTH BURDEN WOULD BE BORN NOT JUST BY THE RESIDENTS OF THE PILOT COUNTIES BUT BY THOSE OF SURROUNDING COUNTIES INTO WHICH INTO WHICH LATE NIGHT DRINKERS MAY TRAVEL. YOUR JOB IS LEGISLATORS IS TO A WAVE OF THIS POTENTIAL HEALTH BURDEN AGAINST THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS TO THE SPECIAL INTERESTS. SUPPORTING THE BILL INCLUDING THE ALCOHOL INDUSTRY AND LOCAL BUSINESSES SELLING ALCOHOL TO CUSTOMERS INTO THE EARLY MORNING. IN DOING SO I URGE YOU TO CONSIDER THAT PUBLIC HEALTH IS NOT SIMPLY ANOTHER SPECIAL INTEREST. IT IS THE BEST EXPRESSION OF SOCIETY'S INTEREST IN THE COMMON GOOD. IN ASSURING THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH EVERY INDIVIDUAL CAN ACHIEVE MAXIMUM HEALTH AS SUCH WE BELIEVE THAT HEALTH CONSIDERATIONS SHOULD ALWAYS TRUMP THE FINANCIAL BENEFITS. SPECIAL INTERESTS AND CONSIDERING CHANGES IN PUBLIC POLICY. IT'S HEALTH VERSUS PROFITS CHOICE SHOULD BE EASY NO ONE NINE OH FIVE THANKS. GOOD AFTERNOON MY NAME IS LYNN BROWN I'M THE PROGRAM MANAGER AND LAW ENFORCEMENT LIAISON FOR MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING IN SACRAMENTO. MATT CALIFORNIA OPPOSES SENATE BILL NINE ZERO FIVE CALIFORNIA SHOULD RETAIN A UNIFORM BAR CLOSING. TIME TO HELP PREVENT BAR HOPPING TO FIND ONE LAST DRINK AN ESTABLISHMENT WITH A LEADER CLOSING TIME. WITH THIS BILL NEIGHBORING CITIES COULD FACE A SPILL OVER EFFECT IN INCREASED DEMAND ON LAW ENFORCEMENT AND THE RESOURCES NEEDED TO KEEP ROADS SAFE. WE'VE ALSO HEARD THE ARGUMENT THAT EXTENDING BAR HOURS WOULD ELIMINATE THE CROWDS OF PEOPLE AND OF POTENTIAL RUSH. OF DRUNK DRIVERS LEAVING THE BARS AT TWO A. M.. QUITE FRANKLY OUR ROADS ARE RELATIVELY UNOCCUPIED TO A. M. AS COMPARED TO FOUR AND FIVE AM. CALIFORNIA STILL HAD OVER ONE THOUSAND FATALITIES ON OUR ROADWAYS IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN DUE TO DUI CRASHES THAT'S A SIXTEEN POINT 2% INCREASE OVER. TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THIS LEGISLATION WILL PUT FRESHLY IMPAIRED DRIVERS ON THE ROAD AT THE TIME OF DAY WHEN COMMUTERS. CARPOOL TAKING CHILDREN TO SCHOOL HIGHWAY WORKERS AND OTHER TRAVELERS ARE BEGINNING TO FILL OUR ROADWAYS. AGAIN THE VAST MAJORITY OF RESEARCH DOES NOT INDICATE THAT EXTENDING HOURS WOULD MAKE US SAFER. RATHER THE RESEARCH SHOWS THE OPPOSITE. IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN THERE WERE TEN THOUSAND FOUR HUNDRED NINETY SEVEN PEOPLE. KILLED ON OUR NATION'S HIGHWAYS DUE TO DO YOU AYE CRASHES. AN AVERAGE OF ONE ALCOHOL IMPAIRED DRIVING FATALITY OCCURS EVERY FIFTEEN MINUTES. SO FOR EVERY FIFTY MINUTES THAT WE SIT HERE. SOMEONE IS BEING KILLED IN IMPAIRED DRIVING CRASH. AND REMEMBER THESE ARE JUST NUMBERS THEY IS THERE'S ART NUMBERS AT ALL THEY'RE HUMAN BEINGS THEIR PEOPLE WITH FAMILIES WITH FRIENDS WITH LOVED ONES. THERE PEOPLE LIKE YOU AND LIKE ME. THIS BILL HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF TRAGEDIES ON CALIFORNIA'S ROADS MOTHERS AGAINST DRUNK DRIVING RESPECTFULLY URGES ARE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATORS TO VOTE NO. ON SENATE BILL NINE ZERO FIVE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. I GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS CARSON BENEFITS FREDRICKSON HERE FROM ALCOHOL JUSTICE -- THE FACT THAT EXTENDING LAST CALL TIMES CAUSES HARM IS REALLY NOT UP FOR DEBATE WE HAVE RESEARCH INDEPENDENT AND PEER REVIEWED FROM FOUR CONTINENTS LOOKING AT HALF A CENTURY OF DATA. ALL THAT DEMONSTRATES THIS. DISCUSSION STARTS BUT IMPORTANTLY DOES NOT END WITH ANNE MARIE CRASHES. SO CALIFORNIA IS IN A PRETTY MUCH ON THAT KNOWLEDGE CRASH CRISIS ARE THE MOST RECENT ODS REPORT HAD INTOXICATED TALLIES UP 20% OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS. THESE ARE VERY DRAMATIC ENDS TO A NIGHT OUT AND THAT WE'LL SEE MORE OF THEM WITH LITTLE LAST CALL TIMES ACCORDING TO INTERNATIONAL EVIDENCE SYSTEMATICALLY REVIEWED BY OVER A DOZEN AMERICAN PUBLIC HEALTH EXPERTS. AS THE CDC COMMITTEE THAT DOCTOR CASTLE LAUNCHES REFERRING. TO I IN THIS CASE COMMONSENSE ALIGNS WITH THE RESEARCH BOTH COMMONSENSE AND RESEARCH SHOW THAT PARTY HOTSPOTS ATTRACT PEOPLE EVEN IF THEY CAN'T BUDGET FOR CAR SERVICE THEY WILL DRINK MORE THAN IF THE BAR CLOSED IT. TOO THERE WILL BE MORE EXHAUSTED WHEN DRIVING HOME AND THAT WILL LEAD TO MORE DE WISE AND MORE CRASHES. BUT PRESSURES ARE NOT THE ONLY HARM THEY'RE NOT EVEN THE CHIEF HARM. THE EVIDENCE OF SPIKES IN INJURIES AND CRIME IS OVERWHELMING AYE WE'VE SEEN THIS IN NEW YORK THERE'S A STUDY -- THAT THAT NEW YORK HAS THE SORT OF LOCAL CONTROL STATE THAT WERE SO. SOSA I SEE AS AN IDEAL. AND THERE THAT THAT EXTRA HOUR OPEN AFTER ONE THE START EACH EXTRA HOUR AFTER ONE A AND NEED SIGNIFICANTLY MORE VIOLENT CRIMES. BELIEVE IT'S ALMOST FIVE PER. HUNDRED THOUSAND THE TOTAL COST OF THIS IS TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY. THIS AND AT THIS ANALYSIS DID NOT INCLUDE NEW YORK CITY. I YOU CAN LOOK -- ELSEWHERE CHEN IN NORWAY -- THERE WAS A PATCHWORK OF EXTENDED RETRACTED LAST CALL TIMES EVERY HOUR FUTURES EXTENDED ADDED 17% OF THE RATE OF ASSAULTS -- EVERY HOURS ATTRACTED DECREASED ASSAULT BY 21% IN THE IN IN AMSTERDAM WHICH A YOU KNOW MOST WAS HE IS A GLOBAL CITY. THEY THEY CREATED IN FACT EXACTLY THE SAME KIND OF UP PARTY ZONES THAT THIS BILL WOULD CREATE AND SAW THAT THOSE RESULT IN 34% INCREASE IN LATE NIGHT AMBULANCE CALLS. THESE FIGURES ARE JUST A SMALL SAMPLE OF THE FORTY OR FIFTY THAT OUR BY THE REFER TO BY EXPERTS. ALSO WITH THAT MIND WE WE WE OBJECTED TO SOME OF THE SERB MISUSE OF SCIENTIFIC TERMS IN THIS BILL THIS IS NOT REALLY A PILOT IT'S NOT REALLY LOCAL CONTROL -- SO IN THIS ISSUE THE ENTIRE POINT IS TO GET MORE PEOPLE TO THE CITIES THAT HAVE LATE LAST CALL TIMES AND TO GET THEM TO SPEND MORE MONEY ON ALCOHOL. PEOPLE THEN DRINK MORE GO BACK HOME SOME OF THEM ARE DRUNK SOMEWHERE A VIOLENT SOME CRASH THE HARM TO THIS BILL DO NOT STAY LOCAL. THOUGH THE REVENUES CERTAINLY WILL STILL STAY LOCAL -- NO HARMS AND BACKSPLASH OVER ALTERING THE COMMUNITIES AND HOW MANY SURROUNDING COMMUNITIES -- A PILOT IS SUPPOSED TO BE A SMALL SCALE STUDY THAT LOOKED AT IMPACTS AND HOW TO MITIGATE THEM. THIS PILOT AFFECTS FIVE LARGEST TEN CITIES IN CALIFORNIA AYE IF YOU TAKE THEIR COMBINED CENSUS AREAS OF THAT IS A ABOUT 76% OF POPULATION. IT DOESN'T SPECIFY HOW IT WILL MEASURE HARM OR MITIGATE THE HARMS THAT EMERGE IN A DEATHLY DOES NOT BOTHER FUNDING DATA COLLECTION OR ANALYSIS. THERE IS NO EVIDENCE THAT CALIFORNIA EXCEPTIONALISM MEANS WERE IMMUNE TO ALCOHOL HARM PLEASE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO STOP US RECKLESS EXPERIMENT IS CALIFORNIA LIVE CALIFORNIAN LIVES ON THE LINE THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME. OKAY WILL TAKE ADDITIONAL ON TESTIMONY OPPOSITION. YES OUR BRUCE LIVINGSTON AND I'VE BEEN ASKED -- TO EXPRESS THE OPPOSITION OF INSTITUTE FOR PUBLIC STRATEGIES OF SAN DIEGO COUNTY AND BARBARY COAST NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATION. OF SAN FRANCISCO. SARAH COOLEY I'M HERE TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION FROM THE CALIFORNIA CALL POLICY LINES THINKING. TOM RETREAT WITH CALIFORNIA BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION IN OPPOSITION. GOOD AFTERNOON DR GERM COOLER THE CALIFORNIA FRIDAY I PARTNERSHIP REPRESENTING YOUNG PEOPLE IN FIFTY OF OUR FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WHO ARE CONCERNED THAT THIS WILL BE GOOD FOR BUSINESS BUT GOOD FOR BUSINESS AND EMERGENCY ROOMS. FOR A. B. C.. AND FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT SO WE WOULD SUGGEST THIS IS NOT THE BEST CHOICE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. A RIVER JAMES BUTLER FROM THE CALIFORNIA COUNCIL ON ALCOHOL PROBLEMS.

UP MARC CARLSON LUTHERAN OFFICE OF PUBLIC POLICY IN OPPOSITION THERE IS NO REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. COSTS OF HARM ARE ENORMOUS. I WORKED AS A STATE FIREFIGHTER OVER THREE DECADES ATTENTION OPERATOR. I'VE SEEN AS A SEASONAL I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND WHAT HAPPENS WHEN OUR CARS OR TRUCKS HIT P. GINNY POLLS -- AND I'VE SEEN FIRST HAND WHAT HAPPENS JUST. JUST AFTER THE BARS CLOSE WHEN SOMEBODY'S GOING HOME IN NAY GENTLY DRIFT INTO THE GRASS. WITH A HOT MUFFLER THE END RESULT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AND IT DOES NOT SMELL GOOD [inaudible] THANK YOU. FRED JONES I'VE BEEN ASKED TO COME AND SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THE WALL LAS MEMORIAS PROJECT LOS ANGELES. AS WELL AS THE WEST ALAMEDA COUNTY ALCOHOL MARIJUANA AND PRESCRIPTION DRUG COALITION IN OPPOSITION. MISTER CHAIR JUST ADVANCE ON BEHALF OF LIFT APOLOGIZE AND MISS THE US SUPPORT TESTIMONY BUT LEFT ISN'T SUPPORT. OKAY TO EVERY ADDITIONAL TESTIMONY IN OPPOSITION. SEEING NONE WILL GO AHEAD AND BRING IT -- BACK TO THE MEMBERS FOR QUESTIONS [inaudible] IT GIVES. THANK YOU VERY MUCH WAS CHAIRMAN OF THIS IS TO THE AUTHOR TO EVER CAN ANSWER HIS QUESTION. I UNDERSTAND -- HAS A FIVE YEAR SUNSET IS THAT TRUE THIS PART OF THE BILL AND AFTER THE FIVE YEARS -- I'M ASSUMING GATHERING FACTS AND INFORMATION WHAT IS THE PROCESS IN WHICH THAT INFORMATION WILL BE SHARED WITH THIS BODY. LED SORT OF A BODY YES I THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMAN -- SO AT THE END OF THE FIVE YEAR PILOT THERE WILL BE A REPORT -- BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE AND THE LEGISLATURE WILL THEN EVALUATE WHETHER TO EXTEND THAT EXPAND THE TERMINATOR. WHATEVER BUT THAT'LL BE UP TO UP TO THIS BODY UP TO THE FIGHTER PILOT IN THE COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE WE MAY NOT BE HERE BUT WE'LL COME BACK TO THIS COMMITTEE FOR REVIEW. IT'LL COME TO THE ENTIRE LEGISLATURE AND THEN OF COURSE THERE WOULD NEED TO BE ADDITIONAL LEGISLATION. TO POTENTIALLY EXTEND THE PILOT AND DIED -- REPORT AND DATA WOULD BE PART OF THE LEGISLATIVE RECORD -- MY NEXT QUESTION FROM A FROM THE CHAIR. WHAT HAPPENS IF WE MOVE THIS TIME FROM -- TWO PM WHICH TWO AM WHICH IS PRESENTLY AT THE LAW. TO ELEVEN O'CLOCK. WILL THAT CHANGE IN THE OUTCOMES IN YOUR MIND. I'M SORRY IF THE BUILDER DIED OR IF IF A COMMUNITY THAT I KNOW OF WE IF WE'RE TO CHANGE THAT CHANGES TODAY WELL WILL IT CHANGE -- ISSUES OR DO YOU ARE EYES OR THE TALENTS HE'S SOMETHING OF THAT NATURE THAT DECREASE SO ARE -- AND TO BE CLEAR RIGHT NOW LOCAL COMMUNITIES HAVE THE ABILITY TO STOP ALCOHOL SERVICE BEFORE TWO AM IN THEIR CLAIM IF COMMUNITIES WHERE IT STOPS AT TEN ELEVEN AT NIGHT OR EVEN. EARLIER SO RIGHT NOW IT'S UP TO TO A AND AND SO WE DO HAVE -- THEIR COMMUNITIES AROUND THE STATE WITH EARLIER CLOSING TIMES I'VE IN TERMS OF YOU KNOW WE WE I KNOW IT'S IT'S BEEN. DISMISSED HERE TODAY BUT THE DATA IS REAL THAT -- AT WHEN YOU COMPARE TIME -- VERSES I DO YOU WHY -- COLLISION RATES UP THERE ZERO CARL CORRELATION THERE SOME STATES EITHER GO LEADER THAN CALIFORNIA. OR RELATED TO A ON THAT HAVE SOME OF THE LOWEST IDEA I CLOSING RATES THERE'S SOME REALLY CLOSER STATES THAT HAVE VERY HIGH THERE'S NO CORRELATION ONE WHERE THE OTHER. IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT MAKE SENSE -- IT. WHETHER YOU WHETHER YOU'RE CLOSING AT TANNER BEEN NICER TO AMBER QUORUM THERE IS A CERTAIN SUBSET OF PEOPLE THAT ARE GOING TO ACT. RECKLESSLY UNDERGOING A LEAVE A BAR DRUNK AND GET INTO THEIR CAR AND IT DOES NOT MATTER. WHEN THE SERVICE ENDS THEY'RE GOING TO GO OUT THERE GOING TO DRINK AND THEY'RE GONNA DO WHAT THEY'RE GONNA DO? ON I WANT TO SAY AND I I MENTIONED IS THE COMMITTEE WHEN I PRESENTS BILL LAST YEAR. THIS IS A VERY PERSONAL ISSUE FOR ME WHEN I WAS SIX YEARS OLD. MY AUNT MY FATHER'S ONLY SIBLING I WAS KILLED BY A DRUNK DRIVER IN NEW JERSEY IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES WHEN THE DUI LAWS WERE. HORRIBLE IN TERMS OF HOLDING PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE. AYE EXCHANGE OUR FAMILY FOREVER AND EXTREMELY SENSITIVE AYE TO THIS ISSUE ARE AND IF I WOULD NOT BE PROPOSING A BILL. TO INCREASE DERIVES. I AND I DO NOT THINK I DON'T THINK THE DATA SHOWS THAT LATER CLOSING TIME MEANS MORE. IDEALIZED IF YOU SCALED EVERYTHING BACK IN CALIFORNIA ABOUT. TWO ELEVEN YOU WOULD STILL HAVE DO YOU LIES PEOPLE WOULD GO OUT EARLIER. I AND YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT A VERY SENSITIVE ALSO TO THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF ALCOHOL. ALCOHOL ABSOLUTELY HAS HEALTH IMPACTS I AND I THINK IF YOU LOOK AT PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING THE LIQUOR STORES. AND BUYING LIQUOR AND DRINKING AT HOME OR ELSEWHERE VERSUS SOMEONE AT AN ELECTRONIC -- DANCE MUSIC MEDIUM PARTY THE MORNING BY A FIFTEEN DOLLAR COCKTAIL. WHICHIS CONTRIBUTING MORE DOOR HEALTH CRISIS IT'S NOT EVEN THE SAME UNIVERSE I MEAN THERE'S BEEN SO MUCH HYPERBOLE. ABOUT THE THE FIRE AND BRIMSTONE THAT SUPPOSEDLY GOING TO COME DOWN ON US IF SEVEN CITIES HAVE THE OPTION OF SAYING. ONE THIS THREE OR IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD OR MAYBE A FEW NIGHTS A YEAR WE'RE GONNA LET PEOPLE STAY OUT LATER ON IT'S BEEN SOME OF THE MOST EXTREME HYPERBOLE I HAVE SEEN. AROUND ANY BILL -- SO THERE ARE REAL IMPACTS DO YOU WHY IT'S SO IMPORTANT -- TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF THE ALLIES TO ADDRESS THE HEALTH IMPACTS OF ALCOHOL. HAVING SOME CLUBS GO A COUPLE HOURS LATER IS NOT GOING TO BE A MEANINGFUL PART OF THAT EQUATION BUT IT WILL ALLOW. PEOPLE TO ENSURE THEIR COMMUNITIES MORE WITH THANK YOU VERY MUCH SENATOR I THINK YOU'VE ANSWERED PLEASE MARQUIS VERY THOROUGHLY I KNOW YOU WORKED EXTREMELY HARD IN TERMS OF GETTING. US TO THIS PARTICULAR POINT -- AND I YOU KNOW. THIS IS A VOLUNTARY TO THE CITY COUNCIL IS ALSO HAVE TO ADOPTED I WAS READING OF THE BILL WHERE -- COMMITTEE IS IS IS IS THERE TACTICS DOUBTLESS WHERE THERE'S A HIGH PATROL OFFICER OR SOMEONE FROM HIGH PATROL DEPARTMENT AS WELL AS LOCAL P. D.. THAT'S INVOLVED IN TERMS OF SHAPING UP AND THINGS OF THAT NATURE SO THAT'S VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO ME SO THAT ANSWERS ALL MY QUESTIONS -- AT THIS POINT THANK YOU THANK YOU. MR LOW AND THE MISTER JONES OR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR OTHER QUESTION -- FOR ARE A PROFESSOR AND THE PUBLIC HEALTH REPRESENTATIVE IN OPPOSITION O. WHO ALSO PROVIDED THE STATISTICS AND DATA. AND THE QUESTION WAS WHAT WAS THE LAST TIME THAT YOU WENT OUT AT A TRICKY AT NIGHT OR A BEVERAGE AND I TALKED. APPROXIMATE WHAT TIME WOULD YOU WHAT WOULD YOU WOULD YOU GO PERSONALLY -- HARD TO REMEMBER THE LONG TIME SINCE I'VE BEEN OUT DRINKING. BUT I LIVED IN NEW YORK CITY FOR AWHILE. AND I DO REMEMBER THE SCREAMING IN THE FIGHTS IN ALL THE COMMOTIONON THE CORNERS AT FOUR AM -- I WAS ON THE TENTH FLOOR I COULD REALLY GET TO SLEEP. UNTIL AFTER A FOUR UNTIL AFTER FOUR AM. BECAUSE OF ALL THE FIGHTS AND SHOUTING GOING ON DOWN STIFF DOWN ON THE STREETS [inaudible] YOU'RE. SO CHECK THE DATA OR THE PERSONAL EXPERIENCES THAT YOU HAVE IT'S BEEN QUITE SOMETIME YOU DON'T RECALL THE LAST TIME THAT YOU. MAY HAVE GONE OUT FOR A BEVERAGE IN SIMILAR AS WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE ISSUE AREA THAT IS PERTINENT TO THE POLICY THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW IT'S IRAQ RIGHT. WHAT'S PURDUE'S RESEARCH OF THE CDC AND WHAT THAT SHOWS CONCLUSIVELY IS THAT THERE IS HARM KEEPING THE BARS OPEN LATER OKAY -- BECAUSE I WOULD OF AT SHARE THAT IT'S BEEN MY OBSERVATION AND YOU CAN CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG BUT INDIVIDUALS THAT DO TYPICALLY GO OUT YOU SHOULD THEY GO OUT AT TEN O'CLOCK. AT IN THESE ESTABLISHMENTS IT WOULD BE QUITE EMPTY AND AS MILLENNIAL IT'S BEEN MY OBSERVATION THAT I'VE SEEN INDIVIDUALS TYPICALLY GOING OUT AT ELEVEN THIRTY OR TWELVE O'CLOCK. AND WHEN THAT TYPICALLY WHEN THAT OCCURS LAST CALL MAYBE AT ONE THIRTY SO WE'RE ONLY TALKING ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF. TO CONSUME YOUR BEVERAGE OR TWO OR HOWEVER MANY WE CONSUME. AND THE CONCERN THAT I WOULD HAVE AN INTEREST YOUR RESPONSES THAT WITH SUCH A SMALL SHORT PERIOD WE KNEW OF TIME. THAT IT DOES NOT ALLOW FOR INDIVIDUALS WHO IS ACTUALLY COUNTER INTUITIVE TO WHAT YOU WERE SUGGESTING WHICH IS. TO THIS IF WE WERE TO SUPPORT THE BILL AND ALLOW FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME INDIVIDUALS DON'T AS USE MENTION FEEL LIKE THEY NEED. TO CHOW DOWN AND CONTINUE TO FELLOW FIND AN OPERA FAST PACED RATHER THAN HAVE OPPORTUNITY TO ABSORB -- THAT THAT ALCOHOL AND OR HOW THAT HAS APPEARED OF TIME AND OR OTHER TO COOL DOWN BEFORE THEY ARE GOING ON TO THE STREETS -- BUT I DON'T KNOW IF YOU HAD ANY OTHER CONFLICTING EVIDENCE TO TO A BEST INDICATE THAT IN FACT IN ACTUALITY THAT THAT IS NOT THE CASE IN IN CURRENT REALITY IN EXISTENCE IF. YOU'VE EVER EXPERIENCED GOING OUT CURRENTLY TODAY WELL MY ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF THE ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE OF ANYBODY HERE IS NOT REALLY RELEVANT WHAT'S RELEVANT IS WHAT THE RESEARCH IS FROM THE CDC AND THE CDC. HAS FOUND THERE IS HARM KEEPING THE BARS OPEN ANOTHER TWO HOURS THAT'S THE SCIENCE. OKAY. SAME COMMENT. OKAY MISTER JONES SAWYER. BUT IT NOW I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD I THINK THIS IS LONG OVERDUE AND WE'VE BEEN AT THIS FOR FIFTY YEARS AND FIFTY YEARS AGO. OF OUR I DON'T THINK WE EVEN HAVE SEAT BELTS AND WE GOT TO LAWS AFFECTED IF YOU'VE GONE. TO COMPARE. WHAT ARE LAWS WERE NAY ACTION RATE FIFTY YEARS AGO COMPARED TO NOW? ANNA AND I WILL. ALLY MYSELF WITH WHICH SOME ECONOMISTS THAT -- MY COULD YOUNGER COLLEAGUE MILLENNIAL COLLEAGUES AS I WAS MILLENNIAL SON. WHO HAS A? ON OCCASION HE'S TWENTY SIX ON OCCASION HE'S CALLED ME. AND SAID IT IS INDEED RELATED TO CLOCK IN THE MORNING I'M FREAKING OUT. AND HE'D TELL ME I TOOK OVER DEAD. SO EVEN OUR PATTERNS BUT HOW WE DRINK AS A PAIR POST TO BACK IN. SEVENTY NINE ONE I PROBABLY GOTTEN EVEN IF I DID I KNOW I GOT MICHAEL. AND SO ABSOLUTELY I WAS A PROBLEM BUT I HAVE A FEELING NOW. BASED ON WHAT MY COLLEAGUE IS SAYING THAT YOUNG PEOPLE'S PATTERNS OF HOW THEY DRINK OF DRAMATICALLY CHANGE IN ADDITION. I'VE LOVED. I'VE BEEN IN OTHER STATES LIKE FLORIDA -- WERE YOU EVERYBODY THAT CARD AND HAVE AN OPEN CONTAINER AND AS LONG AS THE DRIVERS NOT DRINKING. THAT'S LEGAL I'VE BEEN AND LOUISIANA WHERE YOU PULL UP WE GET UP MARGARITA LIKE IT. LIKELY DRIVE TO LOOK AT TACO BELL AND SO I'VE SEEN SOME REALLY ABHORRENT WAYS OF DOING THIS I DON'T SEE THAT. IN YOUR BILL ESPECIALLY STATE YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT GATHERING DATA THAT WAS GOING TO BE MY QUESTION I'M FLAT. ON MY COLLEAGUE FROM CARSON -- ASKED ABOUT THAT BECAUSE I THINK LA AND THE OTHER CITIES WILL BE PERFECT EXAMPLES OF HOW WE CAN ACTUALLY LOOK AT THIS AND SEE -- WHAT WHAT NEEDS TO BE DONE ON HOW WE CAN IMPROVE IT? THE OTHER THING IS ALSO BEING FROM LOS ANGELES ON LOCAL CONTROL -- I BELIEVED AT THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS A LOCAL COUNCIL PEOPLE WILL COME UP WITH A WILL DEVELOP A PLAN. WORKING WITH CH P. AND OTHERS SO THAT WILL BE THE SAFEST. POSSIBLE SITUATION GROW FROM TWO O'CLOCK TO FOUR O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING AND AND THAT GIVES ME ON A LOT OF SENSE OF SECURITY. THAT THEY'RE NOT JUST GOING TO OPEN THE FLOODGATES FROM AIR GOING TO BE VERY VERY ON ON DELIBERATE. AND HOW IN YOUR THINKING AND HOW THEY ACTUALLY OPEN UP AND ALLOW THESE ESTABLISHMENTS OF TO STAY OPEN. AND SO UPBEAT YOU'VE KIND OF ANSWERED -- MY QUESTIONS AND I'LL JUST LEAVE YOU WITH THIS I EVERY MONDAY SINCE I'VE BEEN ELECTED -- I TAKE THE FIRST FLIGHT OUT OF LA. SOMETIME JUST FIVE TEN IN THE MORNING SOMETIME TO SIX IN THE MORNING. I'M ON WROTE. IT AT FOUR FIVE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING [inaudible] ALMOST DESERTED. AND I DON'T SEE. ANY PROBLEMS THAT THAT MAYBE. OTHER PEOPLE OR ALLUDING TO BECAUSE I CAN'T SEE THAT MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE EVEN NOW. AND SO OF IT WILL BE GREAT TO SEE [inaudible] FURTHER. WHAT YOU DEBT WHICH YOU GET AFTER FIVE YEARS OF A? STUDY WHETHER OR NOT THAT CHANGES BECAUSE I ACTUALLY PLAN TO BE HERE FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND SEE WHAT HAPPENS SO TO THANK YOU. COULD WE HAVE ADDITIONAL. QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS FROM MEMBERS. GOD LIKE. TO FIRST OF ALL THANK YOU. CENTER FOR YOUR GIL JENSEN WORK ON THIS ISSUE WE'VE WORKED TOGETHER SEVERAL YEARS A ON THIS SUBJECT -- YOUR COLLABORATION WITH THIS COMMITTEE I THINK LAST YEAR WE TOOK EIGHTEEN TWENTY AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL -- WE CERTAINLY GOT INTO THE WEEDS AND MADE SOME IMPORT REFINEMENTS. AND THEN I WOULD. ARGUE WE CONTINUE TO FIND THE BILL THIS YEAR OF WOULD REPORT BACK LIMITING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL WITH SELECT A BURST OF CITIES THAT. I HAVE LOCAL SUPPORT FOR SOME. LOCAL CONTROL ON THE SUBJECT OF WHETHER IT BE AS YOU SAID FOR A DISTRICT A FEW NIGHTS A YEAR OR SOMETHING LARGER. ARMED AND THAT THAT REPORT WOULD THEN COME BACK. TO THE LEGISLATURE OUGHT TO BE REVIEWED AND WE MAY WANT TO CONSIDER ADDING AMENDMENT -- TO ENSURE THAT BOTH A POLICY COMMITTEES IN BOTH HOUSES OF OUR RECEIPT OF THAT INFORMATION TO THOSE REPORTS OF THAT WE CAN FURTHER -- REFINE THIS ISSUE LIKE RICHARD JONES SAWYER FIVE YEARS. AND ASKING YOU THESE QUESTIONS. TO THAT WITNESSES I APPRECIATE THE CONCERNS RAISED -- I THINK. A LOT MANY OF THOSE CONCERNS ARE CERTAINLY THE SPIRIT BEHIND THOSE CONCERNS ARE AT THE CORE OF THE AMENDMENTS WE'VE MADE SO THAT WERE PROPERLY ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE AND TAKING SERIOUSLY -- ANY ISSUES THAT COULD DEVELOP AND MONITOR IN THOSE ISSUES IN ADDRESSING THAT IF NECESSARY I'M. FAMILIAR WITH THE DATA THAT SENATORS SHARED WITH THE COMMITTEE -- CERTAINLY SEEMS TO SUGGEST OR SO. AT BARE MINIMUM A LACK OF CONSISTENCY OR PATTERN. I KNOW WE'VE CITED A LOT OF OTHER STUDIES -- NO COMMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE I KNOW WE TALKED ABOUT DRUNK DRIVING IN THE ON THE INCREMENTAL OR OR OR OR SPIKE IN A RECENT STATISTICS THERE. IT BE GREAT IF YOU COULD SUBMIT TO THE COMMITTEE FOR OUR REVIEW IN OUR RECORDS -- DOES STATISTICS OVER THE LAST TEN TO FIFTEEN YEARS -- AND ANY RELATION A BETWEEN COMMITTEE ARE COMMUNITIES RATHER THE HAVE EARLIER HOURS VERSUS LATE AND SO THAT WE CAN AT A FURTHER ESTABLISH STATEN -- I'LL CALL JUSTICE PROVIDED A REPORT TO THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS FOR REVIEW. THERE WAS SOME REFERENCE AND ALL DIRECTORS QUESTION TO THE GENTLEMAN FROM ALCOHOL JUSTICE ABOUT INTERNATIONAL -- CIRCUMSTANCES -- AND I THINK YOU REFERENCED AMSTERDAM AND IN HERE IF YOU REFERENCE ANY OTHER SPECIFIC COUNTRIES. I DON'T SEE THAT IN THIS PARTICULAR PROVIDE A REPORT THAT YOU PROVIDED A BUT IF YOU WANT. TO PROVIDE THE COMMITTEE WITH FURTHER INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT I THINK THAT WILL BE HELPFUL IN UNDERSTANDING. THE OUTCOMES -- AND ANY CHANGES THAT HAVE OCCURRED AS A RESULT OF THOSE OUTCOMES IN POLICY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ON THE SUBJECT SO FEW BE KIND ENOUGH TO PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION -- FOR FURTHER REVIEW. AND SENATOR APPRECIATE YOUR CONTINUED A EFFORT TO REFINE THE BILL WOULD. TAKING THE COMMITTEE MEMBER IT'S TODAY -- AND WITH THAT WE HAVE A MOTION FOR MISTER JONES SAWYER SECOND FROM MR LOW.

GOD FOR BID MAKE MONEY FROM OF BEING OPEN AS A AS A BUSINESS -- WE WE COURSE FOCUS LEGITIMATELY ON PUBLIC HEALTH THE PUBLIC SAFETY WHICH IS BILL DIES.
