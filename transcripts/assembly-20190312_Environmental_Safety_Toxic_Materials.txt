ALL RIGHT NOW WE'LL GET ON TO A VERY IMPORTANT -- PC BUSINESS. OF ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA PLEASE PROCEED THANK YOU CHAIR MEMBERS -- IN TWO THOUSAND SIXTEEN WE PASSED AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE AND WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. WHICH REALLOCATED A FEE ALREADY IMPOSED ON ALL CAR BATTERIES TO FUND THE CLEANUP OF CONTAMINATION COSTS BY LEAD ACID BATTERIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. I IN RESPONSE TO THE MAN MADE DISASTER EXCITING IN MY BACKYARD. WE'RE HERE TODAY WITH AB ONE FORTY TWO WHICH ADDRESSES THREE TECHNICAL PROBLEMS THAT WERE IDENTIFIED IN THE FERMENTATION. OF THIS FUND. STATE MANY FACTORS CAN TO PAY A ONE DOLLAR FEE ON ALL BATTERY SOLD IN THE STATE. THE BILL WILL ALSO ALLOW THE CD TFA TO POST WHO IS REGISTERED WITH THE REGISTER MANUFACTURE ON THEIR WEBSITE. THIS IS SIMILAR TO OTHER FEE PROGRAMS THAT THEY ADMINISTER. IT ALSO CLARIFIES THAT THE CONSUMER FEAST ON NOT APPLY TO ANY PERSON WHEN THE REPLACEMENT LEAD BACK AT THE BATTERY IS INCLUDED IN ANY USED VEHICLE SOLD OR LEASED. BY A NEW MOTOR VEHICLE DEALER. UNDER CURRENT LAW AT THE POINT OF SALE ONE DOLLAR FOR THE CONSUMERS THE AYE IS DEPOSITED. ODD TO THE CLEAN UP FIND MANY FACTORS ALSO PAY A ONE DOLLAR FEE ON ALL BATTERY SOLD IN THE STATE. THIRTY APRIL FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TO THE CONSUMER FEEL INCREASE TO TWO DOLLARS AND THE MANUFACTURE OF FEE WILL SUNSET. THE SENSITIVITY WAS TAKEN ON THE LAST THEIR SESSION AS A REQUIREMENT THAT THE GOVERNOR ASKED US FOR NO ONE WANTED THE TO SUNSET NOT MYSELF NOT THE INDUSTRY NOT THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. WE GOVERNOR WANTED. THIS WILL THEN BE RACES THE MANUFACTURE FEE TO TWO DOLLARS WELL TO KEEP THE FUN EQUITABLE. THE FINAL FACILITY CLEAN UP REPRESENT OF EXCITEMENT OTHER SIMILAR SITES TO REMEDIATION WILL BE THE DELAYED BASED ON AN INABILITY TO GET FUNDING FOR THE% COMPANIES THAT CREATED THE SITUATION IN THE FIRST PLACE. OR RELY ON THE GENERAL FUND. THIS ONE HAS BEEN BRINGING RELIEF TO THOSE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES AND ENSURE SOLUTIONS TO MAJOR LONG TERM PROBLEMS. STARTING IN TWO THOUSAND SEVENTEEN THE FINE HAS RAISED THIRTY MILLION DOLLARS AND FORTUNATELY THE CLEANUP WHICH AS THESE HOMES AROUND THE NECK SITES IS ESTIMATED TO BE. BETWEEN FIVE HUNDRED AND FORTY MILLION AND SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS. WE DON'T INCREASE THE MANUFACTURE FEEL TAKE OVER THIRTY YEARS TO FUND THE CLEANUP AND THAT'S SIMPLY NOT ACCEPTABLE. LASTLY THIS BILL AT A PROVISION THAT THE CHEN CAN ONLY BE REPAID WANTS TO CLEAN UP THE SON OF EXCITED AND THE THIRTEEN OTHER HISTORIC BATTERY MANUFACTURING FACILITIES. WITH ME TO TESTIFY HAVE DEAN WILLIAM WITH CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXICS AND BRIAN STAGGER WITH THE LA COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MEMBERS -- JANE WILLIAMS EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR OF CALIFORNIA COMMUNITIES AGAINST TOXIC SUNNY ALSO CHAIR THE TECHNICAL -- GROUP FOR THE EXCITE COMMITTED BY REGROUP -- THERE'S ABOUT FIFTEEN OF THESE GO SMELTERS IN CALIFORNIA -- WE ARE HOPING THAT. NONE OF THEM ARE THE MAGNITUDE OF CONTAMINATION FROM THE X. I. FACILITY BUT THEY'RE ALL GONNA NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AND HERE'S WHY -- A VERY EXTENSIVE STUDY THAT WE DID IN CALIFORNIA -- AROUND THE EXITE FACILITY LOOKING AT LEAD POISONING BY THE CENSUS TRACT. IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY ABOUT ONE POINT 92% OF KIDS HAVE LED ABOVE FIVE MICROGRAMS PROJECT LEADER. BUT IN A NUMBER OF THE CENSUS TRACKS AROUND EXCITED THAT. CAN RISE TO UP 25%. AND THOSE OF US ON THE EXCITED CAG -- REALIZE SAID ABOUT EVERY DAY SEPARATELY IN THE COMMUNITIES SURROUNDING THE EXITE FACILITY. AND WE EXPECT THAT TO BE OCCURRING AT A NUMBER OF THESE OTHER SMELTERS AND THAT WAS WHY IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT TO US TO INITIATE AND PASS THE BATTERY FEE SO THAT WE CAN START INVESTIGATING. THE SLIGHT SWELL CONTAMINATION PROBLEM ACROSS THE STATE. AND WE CERTAINLY HOPE WITH NEW LEADERSHIP KELLY PA WE CAN ACCELERATE THOSE EFFORTS AND WE HAD AN OVERSIGHT HEARING -- LAST FALL -- AND MANY MEMBERS OF THE EXCITED CAG CAME AND TESTIFIED AND SO THERE'S A LOT OF ATTENTION ON EXCITED BUT WE NEED ATTENTION ON THESE OTHER COMMUNITIES. TO TORRANCE WEST OAKLAND THERE'S A A FORMER SMELTER HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THERE'S ONE IN FRESNO -- THERE'S A NUMBER IN SAN FRANCISCO. SO -- YES -- THE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AT THE TIME IF THEY WOULD PLEASE. GET A C. STABLE SOURCE OF FUNDING OVER TIME SO THAT WE CAN APPROACH THIS WE REVIEW THE FIRST STATE IN THE COUNTRY. TO INSTITUTIONALIZE. A EFFORT TO REDUCE LEAD SOUL CONTAMINATION IN HIGHLY IMPACTED COMMUNITIES AND THE GIRL THAT HOST THE OLD GHOST MELCHER'S. THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN OF THE COMMITTEE BRAINS ON THE HALF OF THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY. BOARD OF SUPERVISORS WE ARE HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF SUNDAY BUT ONE FORTY TWO AND WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HER LEADERSHIP. IN THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE -- AS MISS WILLIAMS SAID YOU KNOW THE EXCITED. THE COUNTY OF LOS ANGELES. IT IS ESTIMATED THAT. THE CONTAMINATION COULD AFFECT THE HEALTH OF OVER A HUNDRED THOUSAND COUNTY RESIDENTS -- AND THAT'S A HUGE ISSUE OF FOR COUNTY WE CERTAINLY REALIZE THAT THE PASSAGE OF AB ONE FORTY TWO WILL PROVIDE A FUNDING STREAM THAT WILL. HELP IN THE CLEANUP EFFORTS WE THINK THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT BILL AND WE RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. THANK YOU OTHERS IN SUPPORT. BILL ALLEY -- ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT AND GET A LETTER IN TIME -- A LITTLE BIT THAT IS OKAY I WANTED TO READ THE ANALYSIS WHICH I WANT TO COMPLIMENT YOUR STAFF ON IS VERY THOROUGH I READ THE OPPONENT'S ARGUMENT. TO SEE IF THEY THINK IT'S PREMATURE WE DONE ESPECIALLY WITH JANE WILLIAMS. CAME IN ORGANIZATIONAL COVER THAT LATER THE WG IN SUPPORT THANKS. MISTER CHAIRMAN RISK OF CASA BEHALF THE CALIFORNIA NEW CAR DEALERS IN STRONG SUPPORT THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE PAUL GUNS ALL THIS HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE SOUTH COAST AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT OPPOSITION. WE HAVE FOUR MINUTES DIVIDED HOWEVER YOU'D LIKE IT. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS JEFF SIGNATURE WITH KP PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF THE BATTERY COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL -- WANT TO START BY RECOGNIZING THE FACT THAT ASSEMBLY MEMBER CHRIS HERE REACHED OUT TO US. ALMOST IMMEDIATELY UPON INTRODUCTION OF THE BILL AND WE BEEN ENGAGED IN. WHAT WE HOPE WILL CONTINUE TO BE A COLLABORATIVE CONVERSATION? ABOUT TELL WHERE THE FEE COMPONENT OF AB ONE FORTY TWO IS HEADED. AND I WANTED TO TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THAT THAT THERE ARE ASPECTS OF THE BILL THAT WE VERY MUCH SUPPORT CERTAINLY. THE LANGUAGE IT CLARIFIES THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF A OF FEE PAYERS AND REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS. OUR HOPE IS THAT THAT WILL LEAD TO ADDITIONAL REVENUE FLOW EVEN WITHIN THE EXISTING FEE STRUCTURE THAT UNTAPPED POTENTIAL THAT I THINK WE'RE ALL. TRYING TO CAPTURE HERE -- AND WE ALSO SUPPORT. THE EMPHASIS IN THE BILL ON DIRECTING THE REVENUE TO ACTUAL SITE CLEANUP WHICH WAS. THE SHARED. INTENT OF ALL THE PARTIES WHO NEGOTIATED. TWENTY ONE FIFTY THREE OUR PRIMARY CONCERN -- IS MOVING AHEAD WITH THE FEE INCREASE. AS WE ARE RECEIVING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM CITY TFA AND% DTS SEE WHICH WILL HELP. DEFINE OF WHAT THE REVENUE BALLOTS WILL NEED TO BE GOING FORWARD. TO ADDRESS NOT ONLY THE EXISTING PROBLEMS BUT THE ONES THAT MISS WILLIAMS ALLUDED TO THE DTS HE IS. STILL IN THE PROCESS OF INVESTIGATING. AND UP AT THE MOMENT WE KNOW THAT CITY TFA IS IS TRYING TO DEFINE THE REVENUE POTENTIAL UNDER THE EXISTING FEE STRUCTURE. AND IT'S NOT JUST A CONCERN ABOUT THE DISCREPANCY THAT THE ANALYSIS ALLUDES TO BETWEEN WHAT. REVENUE IS BEING COLLECTED FROM THE MANUFACTURER ACTED. FROM OTHER RETAIL FEE. IT'S THERE ARE OTHER ANOMALIES THAT WERE TRYING. TO UNDERSTAND AND DEFINE -- THERE'S ABOUT A TWO AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR GAP BETWEEN -- CITY TFA IS REVENUE NUMBERS AND THE PROJECTIONS FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- AS I ALLUDED TO A MINUTE AGO IT'S NOT ENTIRELY CLEAR AT THIS POINT THAT EVERYONE THAT HAS A COMPLIANCE OBLIGATION IS REGISTERED. AND THAT EVERY REGISTRANT THAT HAS A FEE OBLIGATION IS COLLECTING AND REMITTING THOSE FUNDS TO THE STATE -- MAN AGAIN I'M I WANT TO EMPHASIZE WE SHARE THE ASSEMBLY MEMBERS DESIRE TO NOT TO LEAVE ANY OF THAT MONEY ON THE TABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT IT. IT IS INVESTED -- FOR FOR THE RIGHT PURPOSES -- AND I THINK IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTAND. WHAT THE? WHAT AMOUNT OF MONEY THE DEPARTMENT CAN REASONABLY SPEND IN A GIVEN FISCAL CYCLE MY UNDERSTANDING IS WERE EXPECTING ADDITIONAL INFORMATION FROM DTS SEE? WHETHER WILL HELP ADDRESS SAYS ONLY ABOUT A MINUTE LEFT YOU WANT THE OTHER TEACHER WHO TO SPEAK LET LET ME JUST. JUMP TO THE BOTTOM LINE THEN -- WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEE INCREASE BUT WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEE BECOMING A MOVING TARGET OVER TIME. SO WE WANT TO INFORM. THE WITH THE BEST POSSIBLE INFORMATION BEFORE WE MOVED FROM. HI YEAH I'LL BE REAL QUICK -- PERSONAL THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE TODAY. MY NAME IS TERRY CAM ONE FROM U. S. BATTERY MANUFACTURING IN CORONA CALIFORNIA. WELL ONE OF THE FIVE BATTERY MANUFACTURERS LEFT IN CALIFORNIA. AND WHILE WE ATE WE STRONGLY. SUPPORT MUCH OF WHAT CHRISTINE IS TRYING TO DO I I I I THINK IT'S ADMIRABLE -- OBVIOUSLY LEAD IS IS A CHEMICAL THAT IS HIGHLY TOXIC AND HAS TO BE CONTROLLED PROPERLY -- WHAT WE WOULD LIKE TO SEE AS AN ORGAN IS AS A AS A COMPANY? IS WE DON'T NECESSARILY MIND THE FEE BUT WE WANT TO MAKE SURE IT'S GOING TO THE RIGHT PROVISIONS WE DON'T WANT TO CLEAN UP EVERYBODY'S EVERYTHING. RIGHT WE WANNA LIMITED TO JUST THE BATTERY MANUFACTURERS -- OUR BATTERY SIZE THE GHOST SOCIETY YOU'D MENTION AND IN ADDITION TO THAT. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE A LEGACY SITES. WE DO NOT WANT ANY BATTERY MANUFACTURER AT INCLUDING OURSELVES IF THAT THAT WOULD BE THE CASE AND I AM HIGHLY DOUBTFUL IT WOULD BE -- THAT WOULD AID -- WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO CLICK WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE TO PAY. TO CLEAN UP FOR THEIR MISTAKES. WE DON'T THINK IT THIS FAIRS IN INDUSTRY A AND AND QUITE FRANKLY IT'S IT'S QUITE A FISCAL BURDEN OUR OUR OUR COMPANY ALONE. AND AS WE MOVE FOR TRYING TO GENERATE NEW POSSIBILITIES WITH BATTERIES WITH NEW WILL RENEWABLE ENERGY AND ALL OF THESE OTHER THINGS. IT MAKES IT DIFFICULT FOR US TO DO THAT IF WE'RE HAVING TO GIVE A WHOLE LOT OF MONEY TO PROJECTS THAT WE'RE NOT QUITE SURE -- ARE YOU KNOW UNNECESSARILY -- SHOULD BE GRANTED THOSE FEES SO OKAY I UNDERSTAND AND I GAVE YOU AN EXTRA MINUTE THANK CENTER -- OTHERS IN OPPOSITION -- MEMBERS LIVE IN ALL TOMORROW BEHALF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION WE JUST WOULD LIKE TO ALIGN OUR COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE THAT REPRESENTS THE BATTERY BATTERY COUNCIL INTERNATIONAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- SO I BET THE AUTHOR CAN TELL US. ABOUT YOUR CONCERNS IN TERMS OF HOW THE FUNDS ARE USED AND A ASSEMBLY MEMBER GARCIA GO AHEAD. ACTUALLY I'D LIKE TO START OFF BY SAYING THAT WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON IN OUR GOALS AND WE HAVE BEEN IN COMMUNICATIONS AND WORKING AND THOSE AT THE IN A COLLABORATIVE EFFORT. PREVIOUSLY AND SO AND YOU WANT TO GIVE CREDIT TO THAT OUR SON ON THIS ISSUE. AS WELL THANK YOU -- WE HAVE THE SAME I DON'T THESE ARE TWO THIRDS WILL BILLS THE BIG LIVES I DON'T WANT TO KEEP COMING BACK HERE -- EITHER SO THE MOVIE MP ISSUE IS SOMETHING THAT I HAVE DATA WERE OUT THERE WORKING WITH THE TRYING TO GET THE DATA BECAUSE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE BEING THE SMARTEST ABOUT THIS BUT THAT WERE ABLE TO CLEAN THINGS UP IN A TIMELY MATTER -- AND SO WE ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT'S AT THE EQUITABLE. BETWEEN THE CONSUMER AND THE MANY FACTORS OUT THERE ARE IN THE SAME THING RIGHT WE WE DON'T WANT CURRENT FOLKS TO THEN SAY WELL I'M GOING TO MAKE SOMEONE ELSE. FROM MY PROBLEMS AND WE WANT TO HOLD PEOPLE ACCOUNTABLE ON INTO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT THESE LEGACY SITES I THINK WE HAVE A LOT IN COMMON. OUT THERE -- BUT THE REALITY IS THAT THE FUND DOLLARS AREN'T COMING IN AT THE RATE AT WHICH WE NEED THEM TO THE WILL TO CLEAN UP ACT THAT ALONE MUCH LESS THE FOURTEEN OTHER SITES THAT ARE OUT THERE IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I HAVE -- I HAVE A LOT OF A LOT OF GOOD FAITH THAT WE'RE GONNA GET TO A GOOD SOLUTION AND AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP WORKING TOGETHER. VERY GOOD -- OTHER QUESTIONS FROM MISTER DALI. THANK YOU FIRST OFF TO THE AUTHOR -- BEEN IN THIS FIGHT WITH YOU FOR A LONG TIME NOW. AND I APPRECIATE YOUR PASSION ABOUT IT I'M VERY MUCH AS YOU RECALL WHEN WE FIRST STARTED OUT ON THIS MISSION -- TO HELP THE AFFECTS OF WHAT'S HAPPENED TO YOUR COMMUNITY -- I SAID WITH YOU THERE BUT I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT -- FIRST OF ALL THE ORAL OR IN THE PROCESS WE WE WE WE HAVE COLLECTION AND WE WERE ON THE GROUND IN YOUR COMMUNITY WHAT IS HAPPENING RIGHT NOW CAN YOU TELL ME THAT WITH WHAT THE CURRENT LEGISLATION THAT WE ACTUALLY PASSED. AS FAR AS CLEANING GOES -- THE ADDRESS THAT MAYBE. IT'S IT'S ESTIMATED THAT IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND TWENTY TWENTY EACH YEAR WE'RE GONNA BE CLEAN UP ABOUT THIRTEEN HUNDRED HOMES A TOTAL OF TWENTY SIX HUNDRED HOMES. THAT THE RATE AT WHICH YOU KNOW THEY'RE WORKING AT WE WE HAVE UP TO TEN THOUSAND HOMES THAT NEED TO BE CLEANED UP AT THAT RATE -- AND SO FOR THAT ALONE WE NEED ABOUT A HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILLION TO TWO HUNDRED MILLION. FOR FOR THE NEXT TWO YEARS A FUNDING. ARE WE IT WE HAVE PROVISIONS IN HERE THAT THE MONEY NEEDS TO BE USED FOR THIS AND NOT TO FILL BACK HOLES WITH DTS T. OR WITH HIGHER FEES ARE ALL THESE OTHER PLACES RIGHT AND SO I WANT TO MAKE SURE. THAT IT'S GOING TO WHERE IT'S SUPPOSED TO MY COMMUNITY SUBSET THEY WERE VERY VOCAL AT THAT HEARING IN MY DISTRICT THAT THE MONEY SHOULD BE USED FOR ITS INTENTION. OF THE LACK OF TRUST WITH THE MONEY BILLION MOVING AROUND. AND SO MY COMMITMENT IS NOT JUSTICE TO CLEAN UP THIS MESS WITH TO MAKE SURE WE DO WHAT WE SAID OR GONNA DO FROM THE VERY BEGINNING. AND THAT I'M NOT CREATING YOU KNOW MONEY FOR PET PROJECTS ALL OVER THE STATE -- AND SO BUT THE REALITY IS IS THAT WE NEED WE NEED THIS MONEY AND AND WE NEED AT A AT A FASTER RATE AT AT WHICH IS COMING IN. SO MY FOLLOW UP TO THAT IS. I WAS ASSUMING A LOT OF THAT WAS HAPPEN IN A WE'VE HAD CONVERSATIONS SINCE THEN AND I KNOW YOUR FRUSTRATION THERE -- AND YOU KNOW AS YOU RECALL WHEN WE STARTED OUT THAT YOU KNOW I WAS VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE POLLUTERS WHO ARE GETTING OFF THE HOOK BASICALLY SO THE WAY I LOOK AT THIS IS THAT. THEY DID THE DAMAGE AND THERE'S A LOT OF WRONG THINGS IN THAT COMMUNITY ALONG WITH. BOARDS OF SUPERVISORS AND YOU NAME IT WITH -- AIR QUALITY IN. THERE THEY SHOULD HAVE BEEN THEY WERE HONOR A CONTINUING PERMIT FOR A LONG TIME WHICH I THINK IS WAS VERY WRONG TO THE PUBLIC IN AND THERE WAS SOMETHING NOT RIGHT THERE FOR MANY MANY MANY YEARS. BUT WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH REALITY IN REALITY IS THERE'S CONTAMINATION IN YOUR AREA SO I WAS OKAY WITH THAT BUT NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THESE HOST SITES IN. AND OTHER SITES OUT THERE I WANNA I WANNA ASK HIM. WHERE THE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES IN THIS PROCESS I MEAN? AT SOME POINT THAT THE THE OR THE TAX AND MIKE IT'S IT'S ADDED ON TO STE TO SOMEBODY WHO DIDN'T CAUSE THE PROBLEM. AND THE PEOPLE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM GET TO WALK. AND I THINK THAT'S NOT FAIR TO THE REST OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT ARE PICKING UP THE TAB AND THESE ARE BIG TABS AND THERE'S A LOT OF RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE. TO YOU KNOW. THAT'S OUR JOB HERE IS TO MANAGE A BUDGET AND MANAGE WHAT AND THE COST OF LIVING IN CALIFORNIA CONTINUES TO RISE. AND SO I JUST WANTED YOUR THOUGHTS AND AS I'M HAVING A HARD TIME SWALLOWING THIS RIGHT NOW BECAUSE I KNOW WE STILL HAVE UNTIL. TWENTY TWENTY TWO TO TWO IN OF I KNOW YOU GOT A HEAVY LEFT HERE WITH A TWO THIRDS VOTE I UNDERSTAND THAT SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE MY FRUSTRATION WITH YOU. AND ALSO MY CONCERN ABOUT -- THAT THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE DAMAGE TO WHO ARE HOWEVER THEY GOT AWAY WITH IT ARE STILL GETTING AWAY WITH IT AND I JUST THINK THAT'S WRONG. HI EVERYONE AGREES THAT THE THAT IT'S WRONG IF EVER IT TO ME A BUNCH OF PEOPLE WOULD BE IN JAIL RIGHT NOW. BUT I'M NOT THE QUEEN OF CALIFORNIA SO I CAN'T MAKE THAT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT BUT WE'RE PUSHING FOR THAT THE ME SAY THAT WHEN WE STARTED WITH THIS BILL IT ALWAYS INCLUDED THE IDEA OF THESE LEGACY STATES WE HAVEN'T HAD IN THAT IT'S BEEN ABOUT A FIFTH. DOZEN TO FIT TO FIFTEEN AND AND IN THE SAME WAY I AM WHOLLY IN THE ADMINISTRATION ARE TRAVEL ABOUT BORROWING MONEY FROM THE FEE AND I'M CALLING THEM OUT. MAKING SURE THAT WE MADE WHICH WITH IT'S ABOUT THE LEGACY SITES. IT'S ABOUT EXCITED THE FACT THAT WE ALREADY KNOW AND YES IT'S UNFAIR BUT I HAVE TO WORRY MORE ABOUT LIKE I HAD I CAN'T GET ON PEOPLE HOLD ON WAIT GET SICK A LITTLE BIT LONGER LET ANOTHER GENERATION. HAVE THESE ISSUES AS WELL AT THE END OF THE DAY I FEEL COMFORTABLE ASKING CONSUMERS TO GIVE ME ABOUT A DOLLAR EVERY THREE TO FIVE YEARS WHEN THEY GET A NEW BATTERY I HAD TO REPLACE MY CAR BODY. THAT ARE YOU RECENTLY AND I GOT TO SEE MY BILL IN INACTION IT WAS EXCITING. WE DON'T GET TO DO THAT VERY OFTEN BUT IT WAS EXAMS LIKE I'M WILLING TO GIVE THIS DOLLAR TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE HELP YOUR KIDS. IT'S A MODEL HOPEFULLY I HAVE A LOT OF OTHER CONTAMINATION MY COMMUNITY IS A COMMUNITY HAS BEEN TO LIKE WASTELAND ALL MY LIFE. OUT THERE. BUT YOU KNOW IN IT'S NOT ABOUT FAIRNESS IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE PEOPLE ARE HEALTHY AND LONG TERM IF WE ARE NOT HELPING THEM GET HEALTHIER HAVE THESE CLEAN COMMUNITIES WE'RE GOING TO PAY A LOT MORE THROUGH OUR HEALTHCARE COSTS THAT. IN THE STILL CAN COMMUNITIES ARE BEING SUBSIDIZED THROUGH OUR STATE DOLLARS [inaudible] AND AND NOTHING'S PERFECT I TOOK A GOOD ENOUGH DEAL BECAUSE I CAN'T KEEP GOING HOME TO THAT AND I LIVE IN THAT COMMUNITY AND AND I ALWAYS JOKE THAT I'D BE A GENIUS IF I DON'T HAVE ALL THE CHEMICALS INSIDE OF ME I GREW UP AROUND -- THANK YOU MISTER DALI FOR SHOWING YOUR THAT. YOUR DEDICATION TO THIS ISSUE AND HOW LONG YOU BEEN ON THIS COMMITTEE SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- OTHER QUESTIONS REBEKAH. THANK YOU SOME REMEMBER GARCIA AT AM I'LL BE SUPPORTING IT BECAUSE I AGREE WITH YOU THAT YOU KNOW WE HAVE TO CLEAN UP OUR SOIL. FOR OUR CHILDREN ARE COMMUNITIES AND WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO ALLOW OUR ENVIRONMENT THREE TOXIC BUT I WOULD URGE THAT YOU KNOW WE'RE WE'RE AWAITING A REPORT FROM THE TSC ITS BEST COME OUT. THIS MONTH IS THAT RIGHT IN MARCH YES -- WE HOPE EXACTLY SO THAT'S MY POINT I THINK WE NEED TO CONTINUE AFTER THE HEARING THE INFORMATIONAL HEARING WE HAD WE pKNOW THAT DO TSC NEEDS YOU HELD ACCOUNTABLE AS WE CONTINUE TO GIVE THEM FUNDS FOR THE CLEAN UP THAT WE'RE CHARGING THEM WITH. AND SO I HEARD THAT TO BE A PART OF THIS PROCESS AS WELL. YES ABSOLUTELY AND THIS GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS WHICH MEANS IT'S GONNA BE. WHAT SOMETIME IN MAY? THAT -- THAT'LL BE TAKEN HAPPENED PRO HAVE THE ADDITIONAL INFORMATION I JUST WANT TO GET IT OUT TODAY OTHER QUESTIONS. ALL RIGHT SIR -- DO YOU HAVE A CLOSE I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. RIGHT SO I MERGING AN AYE VOTE -- ONE OTHER THE THE OBJECTIONS WAS WE'RE NOT EXACTLY SURE HOW MUCH IT'S REYES -- BUT EVEN AT THE RATE IS COMING IN EVEN IF IT WERE TO DOUBLE. AND THEN DOUBLE AGAIN THAT'S I MEAN IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH. WE KNOW THAT RIGHT NOW SO AGAIN WE WILL AND THE TIME IT GOES TO APPROPRIATIONS HAVE MORE INFORMATION AND IF. SOMETHING'S CHANGED RADICALLY WE CAN FIND OUT BUT IN THE MEAN TIME AGAIN. YOU KNOW MAYBE YOU COULD GO FROM THIRTY MILLION IF YOU HAD PERFECT ENFORCEMENT. TO FORTY BUT IT'S JUST NOT GOING TO BE ENOUGH FOR ALL OF THE CLEAN UP THAT HAS TO BE DONE SO THAT'S WHY I'M URGING AN AYE VOTE SO. AGAIN -- MY DOORS OPENED HER DOORS OPEN AND WE WILL HAVE MORE INFORMATION BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN -- ARE THE APPROPRIATIONS SAYS HE'S THE BILL. ALL RIGHT CAN I HAVE A MOTION. ALL RIGHT SO MOVED BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER HOLDEN SECOND BY. ASSEMBLY MEMBER MAYOR SU CHI. AND THE MOTION IS T. PAT TO PASS TO APPROPRIATIONS. MADAM SECRETARY PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER ONE AB ONE FOUR TO ONE FORTY TWO CRISTINA GARCIA HI THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS QUIRK. HI QUIRK I MELENDEZ IS ABSENT ARAMBULA IS ABSENT. BAUER-KAHAN. BAUER-KAHAN I DALY. DALY KNOWN HI CRISTINA GARCIA I HOLDEN. HOLDEN I MATHIS. WHAT I TO CHANGE WHAT I TO CHI? FOR ITEM PRICES OUT FIVE MINUTES FIVE VOTES IT IS AB CONGRATULATIONS AND AGAIN -- FOR FOR ALL THOSE INVOLVED WE WILL CERTAINLY -- BE WORKING WITH YOU IN THE FUTURE. ALL RIGHT SO I HAVE TO BILLS TO REDUCE [inaudible] AND I'M GOING TO GIVE THE GAVEL TO MY GOOD FRIEND -- ASSEMBLY MEMBER DOLLY YEAH [inaudible] YEAH [inaudible] FOUR SOME THE FIRST BILL A PRESENT ON IS A BE. FOUR OH TWO AND UP SO. THANK YOU ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY FOR CHERRY AND THANK YOU OTHER MEMBERS FOR BEING HERE I REALLY APPRECIATE -- WITH ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT YOU DO THAT YOU'RE HERE FOR THIS -- ALSO I WANNA THANK COMMITTEE STAFF AND A PARTICULARLY -- PAJO VAN CHI OUR NEW ASSEMBLY SCIENCE FELLOW ARE FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS. AB -- FOR TO AUTHORIZES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ESTABLISH A FUNDING PROGRAM. TO SUPPORT LOCAL OVERSIGHT OF SMALL DRINKING WATER SYSTEMS. ARE THE PROBLEM WE'RE HAVING IS THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF SMALL SYSTEMS THAT THIRTY DIFFERENT COUNTIES. AND THOSE COUNTIES MAY NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO DO TO OVERLOOKED THEM. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES. IS [inaudible] ARM. BECAUSE THE COUNTIES DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FEES SIX OF THE COUNTIES OF ACTUALLY RETURNED DRINKING WATER OVERSIGHT AUTHORITY BACK TO THE STATE WATER BOARD. BOB THE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD REALLY DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE OVERSIGHT. OF WE THINK IT'S THEY THINK IT'S BETTER DONE AT THE LOCAL LEVEL BUT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL THEY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. SO WHAT THEY DO HAVE IS AN OPT IN PROGRAM FOR LOCAL AGENCIES. AND THE GOAL WOULD BE THAT THE AGENCIES COULD OPT INTO THIS PROGRAM. AND THEN THE STATE WATER BOARD WHICH HAS FEES FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE. CAN NÁN HELP FUND THESE LOCAL AGENCIES. SO WHAT THIS BILL IS BASICALLY DOING IS ASKING THE WATER BOARD WITH THEIR FEES FROM OTHER AREAS. TO ACTUALLY FUND THE CLEANUP ARE EXCUSE ME TO FIND THE OVERSIGHT OF THE SMALL AGENCIES IN THESE OTHER SMALLER TYPICALLY RURAL COUNTIES WHICH SIMPLY DON'T HAVE THE MONEY. SO WE'RE LOOKING TO HELP THE SMALL RURAL. WATER SYSTEMS WITH MONEY FOR DATE. THAT'S BASICALLY WHAT THIS IS FOR I DON'T UNDERSTAND WHY ANYONE WOULD NOT OPT IN. BUT IT IS STILL AN OPTION AND THEY DO NOT HAVE. TO I'M HERE TODAY TO JUST TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURES JUST IN MILAN -- FROM THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH ADMINISTRATORS WHICH IS THE SPONSOR OF THIS BILL. AND THAT THAT I'LL INTRODUCE THE OTHER PERSON AND TRY TO KEEP IT TO A COUPLE OF MINUTES. MISTER VICE CHAIR WILL COME BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. JUST ALONG FOR THE LOCAL NUMBER I'M TO HELP DIRECT AS I WOULD LIKE TO YIELD MY TIME TO THE EXPERTS HAVE FROM TWO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS BUT TO TEAMED UP VERY QUICKLY WE BEING A COUPLE OF YEARS WORKING ON THIS RESOLUTION. WOULD NOT TAPPING INTO GENERAL FUNDS WE NOT TAPPING INTO GRANTS THE WHOLE IDEA HERE IS RATHER THAN THE STATE TAKING OVER THE PROGRAMS WHEN THE LOCALS CANNOT AFFORD TO DO WHAT THEY NEED TO DO. THE STATE WILL SIMPLY USE THE SAME SOURCE OF FUNDING AND PAY FOR THE LOCALS WORK WE ALREADY HAVE A PRESIDENT ESTABLISH IN THE LOCAL UNDERGROUND TANK PROGRAM WHICH WHICH IS WORKING REALLY WELL. SO THESE NO GENERAL FUND IS BASICALLY NO NEW FEE ESTABLISHED WE JUST SORT OF AMORTIZING THE MONEY MORE EFFICIENTLY FOR THESE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS. THOSE THAT WANT TO GIVE UP THE PROGRAMS WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF DOING THAT AND I WANTED. TO INVITE YOLO COUNTY AND SACRAMENTO COUNTY TO EXPLAIN WHY THIS IS SO IN ITS HISTORY AND JUST TO EMPHASIZE THAT WE GOT RC RC AND THE IMAM HEALTH ASSOCIATION. AND NINE OTHER JURISDICTIONS IN SUPPORT WITH NO OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU COMMITTEE FOR LETTING ME SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF AB FOUR OH TWO MY NAME IS APRIL MANY GETTING I'M THE DIRECTOR OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH FOR THE COUNTY OF YELLOW. AS WELL AS THE PRESIDENT ELECT FOR THE CALIFORNIA CONFERENCE OF DIRECTORS OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. I'M HERE SPEAKING IN SUPPORT OF AB. IT'S GONNA PROVIDE A AN OPT IN LIKE JUST TO MENTION FUNDING MECHANISM WHICH IS GOING TO HELP US SECURE -- S. TO SUSTAINABLE FUNDING SOURCE FOR OUR LOCAL AM PROGRAM PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM PROGRAM. WHICH WILL ALLOW US LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO CONTINUE TO ADMINISTER THE PROGRAM -- AS AS WAS MENTIONED -- THERE THERE'S A LACK OF FUNDING FOR FOR THIS PROGRAM -- ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WERE NOT ABLE TO CHARGE THE FEES THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO FULLY SUPPORT THE PROGRAM. I AM AND THAT IS WHY A MANY LOCAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE LOOKED AT RETURNING THE PROGRAM BACK TO THE STATE BUT WE FEEL THAT -- IT'S A BETTER PROGRAM TO DO ON THE LOCAL LEVEL WERE BETTER ABLE TO SERVE OUR AND OUR PUBLIC AND OUR CLIENTS SO THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU. TO SUPPORT A BEFORE UNTIL. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HI MY NAME IS CHRIS SUDDENLY AND I'M A REGISTERED ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH SPECIALIST WITH SACRAMENTO COUNTY. AND I'M PROVIDING COMMENTS IN SUPPORT OF AB -- FOR TO ON BEHALF OF CCDE. H. -- AS MANY OF YOU ALREADY KNOW AND AS A SOMEONE AND QUIRK HAS ALLUDED TO LOCALS ARE. FOR A VERY LONG PERIOD OF TIME AND WE ARE VERY GOOD AT BUILDING CONNECTIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH. THE REGULATED COMMUNITY SOME OF THESE SMALL PUBLIC WATER SYSTEMS TO KIND OF PUT A PICTURE TO IT. COULD BE YOUR LOCAL CHURCH CAN BE A SCHOOL -- CAN BE THE NEIGHBORHOOD GROCERY STORE OR A SMALL RESTAURANT IN OFTENTIMES THOSE TYPES OF REGULATED ENTITIES DON'T HAVE THE YOU KNOW THE REVENUE TO SUPPORT AND TO PAY. FOR THESE INCREASINGLY STRINGENT WATER QUALITY REQUIREMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT -- TO ON OUR END THE THE WORK THAT IS NEEDED TO REALLY. EFFECTIVELY PROVIDE THAT SUPPORT AND REGULATORY OVERSIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THE THE MONEY COMING INTO TO SUPPORT IT. SO THE THE FORTUNATE THING IS WITH A BEFORE -- TO DIVE PROBLEM GOES AWAY.

NEXT I'M GOING TO SPEAK ON A. B. FOR THIRTY TWO RIGHT PIECE OF PAPER. ASSEMBLYMEMBER DOLLY AND MEMBERS -- AB FOR THIRTY TWO WOULD CREATE A STATE VERIFICATION FOR LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS OVERSEEING LOCAL HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUP. I HAVE AS YOU. HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUP OR SITE REMEDIATION CAN BE VERY COMPLICATED. AND ENVIRONMENTALLY SENSITIVE DUE TO PROXIMITY TO WATER SOURCES IN NEARBY COMMUNITIES. UNDER CURRENT LAW THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL CERTIFIES. LOCAL AGENCIES UNDER THE CERTIFIED UNIFIED PROGRAM. TO OVERSEE THE CLEAN UP OF CONTAMINATED SITES. IF THE TSC DETERMINES THEY ARE QUALIFIED TO DO SO SO THAT'S CURRENT LAW IT'S D. T. S. C. THAT. DAD DOES THAT TO A BOB CERTIFICATION. CURRENT LAW ALSO AUTHORIZES THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CERTIFY LOCAL AGENCIES IS QUALIFIED CLEANUP. OR OVERSEE A RESPONSIBLE PARTY CLEANUP OF SOIL AND GROUNDWATER CONTAMINATION FROM LEAKING UNDERGROUND STORAGE TANKS. IN BOTH CASES THE STATE ENTITIES INSURE THE LOCAL AGENCIES HAS THE TECHNICAL EXPERTISE STAFF RESOURCES AND TOOLS NEEDED TO OVERSEE OR DO THE SITE CLEANUP. AB FOUR THIRTY TWO AND THIS IS NOW OUR IT'S GONNA CHANGE AB FOR THIRTY TWO EXTENDS THE STATE OVERSIGHT. TO INCLUDE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS WHO OVERSEE RESPONSIBLE PARTIES CONDUCTING HAZARDOUS WASTE CLEANUP. THE INTENT IS CREATE UNIFORMITY AMONGST THE STATE PROGRAMS. CERTIFY LOCAL AGENCIES AND ENSURING COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS. TO MAXIMIZE PROTECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THERE IS NO OPPOSITION WE HAVE LOCAL HALL HEALTH OFFICERS REGARD TO SOME CONCERNS THEY HAVE RAISED. UP BASICALLY THEY DON'T WANT TO BE OVER BURDENED ARMED WITH A PROGRAM. WHICH IS -- GOING TO TAKE THEM A LOT OF TIME OR EFFORT IN WHICH CASE IF THAT WERE THE CASE THEY WOULD SIMPLY NOT BOTHER TO TAKE IT. SO IF WE'RE GOING TO HAVE THEM INVOLVED IT'S GOING TO BEHOOVE US TO COME UP OR DTS SEE AND THE WATER BOARD. TO COME UP WITH A TRAINING WHICH IS ADEQUATE BUT NOT OVERLY BURDENSOME SO THAT'S THE ENTION AND WE'RE WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM CLOSELY AND HOPE TO HAVE THAT ALL WORKED OUT. OF BY THE TIME THE BILL IS SEEN IN APPROPRIATIONS. NOT. OKAY I DON'T THINK I HAVE ANY WITNESSES SORRY. THE MOTION IS SECOND ON THE BILL DID YOU HAVE ARE YOU AS BEGIN SUPPORT. IN IS -- OF OR OKAY YEAH SURE. WITH WOULD LOVE TO TO SEE YOU WOBBLE. MISTER VICE IT JUST MELONES THE LOCAL ENVIRONMENT HEALTH DIRECTORS -- WE WOULD LOVE TO SUPPORT THE BILL IN FACT. MY MY BAD WE WE DIDN'T TO EXPRESS THE CONCERNS OF THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS EARLY ENOUGH. WE REALLY DON'T SEE THE NEED FOR THE BILL THAT'S THE THING WE STRUGGLING WITH WE NOT SHOW WHETHER IT NEEDS A FIX. SO THAT'S THE PROBLEM THAT WE BRING TO THE WE HAVE A LOCAL OF THE SITE PROGRAM WITH STATE WATER BOARD WE HAVE DTC OVERSIGHT. IN THIS CASE THEY HEALTH OFFICES ARE ALLOWED TO OVERSEE LIMITED SIDE OVERSIGHT AND THESE SIGNIFICANT RESTRICTIONS ON WHAT THEY CAN DO. WE ALSO IF I HEALTH OFFICE -- ELECTS TO DO THIS OVERSIGHT. THEY FIRST HAVE TO NOTIFY THE STATE AGENCY THAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO IT AND THEY CAN AVAIL THEMSELVES TO BE. SORT OF SECOND GUESSED OR NOT SHUT DOWN IF THE TSC OF THE STATE AGENCY DOESN'T WISH TO SEE THAT SITE CLOSE SO THEY ARE CHECKS AND BALANCES EVEN IN THE EXISTING PRICES. SO WE WANT TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE CHAIR ON THIS BILL BUT WE DO WANT TO EXPRESS A CONCERN THAT WE HAVE NOT REALLY HEARD WHERE THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS FAILING. AND AS YOU KNOW WITH THE PRICE OF LAND IN CALIFORNIA WE NEED TO CLEAN UP THE SITES THEY'LL THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF SITES SOME OF WHICH ARE JUST AN OLD FORTY FOUR GALLON DRUM IN THE CORNER OF THE LOT. AND BECAUSE THE THESE AREN'T BEING CLEANED UP THEY CANNOT BE USED MORE USE FULLY SO THAT'S THE CONCERN WE HAVE WE WANT TO STAY WORKING WITH YOU. BUT WE DO NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CREATE NOW THE WHOLE PROGRAM LAID OVER ON TOP OF THE HEALTH OFFICES THAT ARE VERY VERY RESPONSIBLE AND WHAT THEY'RE DOING THANK YOU. THANK YOU AT JOHN KENNEDY WITH RC RC OFFER START BY SAYING IT'S IT'S BEEN GOING TO SAY WHAT ARE SEE OUR SON OF WORLD COUNTY REPRESENTATIVES OF CALIFORNIA -- WE'VE APPRECIATED WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF ON THIS BILL WE'VE HAD SOME CONSTRUCTIVE DISCUSSIONS ALSO HIT MY COMMENTS WITH JUSTIN AS WELL ON THE UNDERLYING NEED FOR THE BILL BUT WE DO STILL HAVE SOME CONCERNS -- AS YOU SAID IF THE BILL IF THE CERTIFICATION PROCESS BECOMES AND WHEELED LEE EITHER AND COST WERE STAFF TIME. WE PROBABLY WOULDN'T PARTICIPATE SO WE SHARE THAT CONCERN WE'RE ALSO CONCERNED WITH APA EXEMPTION IN HERE AND WITH THE EPA EXAME PA -- ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT -- EXEMPTING THE STATE WATER BOARD FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEDURES ACT IN THE CERTIFICATION IN DETERMINING THE CERTIFICATION STANDARDS. WE UNDERSTAND THIS PRECEDENT FOR THAT BUT AT THE SAME TIME WE'RE NOT SURE THAT THE LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE INPUT INTO WHAT THOSE REQUIREMENTS WOULD BE -- OR THAT THAT STATE WATER BOARD WOULD HAVE TO RESPOND OR HOW THE DUE PROCESS PROTECTIONS WOULD -- PLAY AND FOR DECERTIFICATION OF A LOCAL OFFICER ALSO HAVE SOME MECHANICAL CONCERNS ASWELL ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS BETWEEN WHEN THE BILL GOES INTO EFFECT AND WHEN CERTIFICATION START SO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH YOUR STAFF -- CONTINUE IN THESE DISCUSSIONS WE'VE HAD.
