SENATE BILL NINETY EIGHT BY THE COMMITTEE ON BUDGET AND FISCAL REVIEW AN ACTUAL LEADING TO EDUCATION FINANCE AND MAKING AN APPROPRIATION THEREFORE TO TAKE EFFECT IMMEDIATELY BILL RELATED TO THE BUDGET. META BUDGET YEARS SOONER MITCHELL THE FLOOR IS YOURS I APPRECIATE THAT VERY MUCH MISTER PRESIDENT HAPPY MONDAY- TO ALL OF MY COLLEAGUES. SENATE BILL NINETY EIGHT IS THE EDUCATION ON THIS TRAILER BILL AND CONTAIN STATUTORY CHANGES TO IMPLEMENT THE TWENTY TWENTY BUDGET ACT. FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE IN THE FOYER REDUCTIONS TO KATIE TWELVE EDUCATION AND INSTEAD DIFFERS. A TOTAL OF ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PRINCIPLE APPORTIONMENT PAYMENTS THE LOCAL EDUCATIONAL AGENCIES FROM THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. TO THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO FISCAL YEAR THESE DEFERRALS WILL BE REDUCED TO THE EXTENT. FEDERAL FUNDS ARE RECEIVED. IT PROVIDES FOR A HOLD HARMLESS FOR AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE FOR PURPOSES OF KP TWELVE APPORTIONMENT. AND THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. DEFINES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFFERING DISTANCE LEARNING AND REQUIRES A LEARNING CAN CONTINUITY IN ATTENDANCE PLAN IN PLACE OF THE LOCAL CONTROL AND ACCOUNTABILITY PLAN FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR. IT APPROPRIATES FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN ONE TIME FUNDING. TO ADDRESS LEARNING LOSS IN OTHER IMPACTS OF COAL THAT NINETEEN OF THIS ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IS DISTRIBUTED BASED ON THE ENROLLMENT OF STUDENTS WITH EXCEPTIONAL NEEDS. TWO POINT NINE BILLION IS DISTRIBUTED IN PROPORTION TO A LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCY SHARE OF SUPPLEMENTAL AND CONCENTRATION FUNDS AND NINE HUNDRED EIGHTY MILLION IS DISTRIBUTED IN PROPORTION TO AN ALLEY A SHARE OF TOTAL LOCAL CONTROL FUNDING FORMULA FOR FUN FUNDS. THE PREVENT SCHOOL DISTRICTS FROM LAYING OFF TEACHERS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. INCLUDES INTENT LANGUAGE THE SCHOOL DISTRICTS COMMUNITY COLLEGE DISTRICTS COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION AND JOINT POWER AUTHORITIES DO NOT LAY OFF CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR AND PREVENTS CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES WHO HOLD POSITIONS THE NUTRITION. TRANSPORTATION AND CUSTODIAL SERVICES FROM BEING TERMINATED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. EARLY EDUCATION AND CHILD DEVELOPMENT. ITS STABILIZERS CHILD CARE PROVIDERS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR BY HOLDING PROVIDERS HARMLESS FOR CHANGES IN THE TENDONS AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL STIPEND FUNDING. IT PROVIDES SEVENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN FEDERAL FUNDS TO CONTINUE TEMPORARY CHILD CARE FOR ESSENTIAL WORKERS AND AT RISK CHILDREN FURTHER INSURANCE PRIORITY FOR THESE CHILDREN IN ENTERING PERMANENT CARE. IT SPECIFIES THAT ADDITIONAL FEDERAL FUNDS ARE RECEIVED FOR CHILDCARE IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR THOSE FUNDS WILL BE PRIORITIZE FOR INCREASING ACCESS TO CARE RECENT TO WORKERS AND OTHERS WE OPENING GRANTS AN ADDITIONAL FIVE. IT SHIFTS CHILDCARE PROGRAMS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE STATE PRESCHOOL PROGRAM FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF SOCIAL SERVICES COMMENCING JULY ONE TWENTY TWENTY ONE. WITH REGARD TO SECTION THIRTY FOUR OF THE BILL WITH REGARD TO- THE EIGHTY A HOLD HARMLESS LANGUAGE LET ME SAY THIS. THE BILL FUNDS ALL EARLY EIGHTIES. SCHOOL DISTRICTS CHARTER SCHOOLS AND COUNTY OFFICE OF EDUCATION USING THE TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE COUNTS IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. ALL SCHOOLS INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS ARE TREATED THE SAME. THE ONE EXCEPTION IS NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS WHO DID NOT HAVE ABA IN THE NINETEEN TWENTY YEAR. THESE SCHOOLS ARE FUNDED USING A PROXY FOR EIGHTY EIGHT BASED ON ACTUAL ENROLLMENT FOR CURRENT PRACTICE WITH NEW CHARTER SCHOOLS. SCHOOL DISTRICTS TEACHERS AND ADMINISTRATORS HAVE STRESSED HOW CRITICAL AREAS FOR TENDED TO BE HELD HARMLESS IN THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR BECAUSE WE KNOW DUE TO THE PANDEMIC MANY STUDENTS WILL BE OUT OF CLASS AT VARIOUS POINTS IN THE YEAR AND SCHOOLS MAY HAVE TO CLOSE DUE TO FUTURE OUTBREAKS. HOLDING EIGHTY EIGHT AT THE NINETEEN TWENTY LEVEL PROVIDE STABILITY TO ELLIE ACE FOR THE PURPOSES OF BUDGETING FOR THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE AND TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEARS. THIS MEANS THAT ABA GROWTH IS NOT FUNDED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE SCHOOL YEAR. DUE TO THE DROP IN STATE REVENUES THE STATE CAN'T AFFORD TO INCREASE BILL SIAPA. THE BULL HOLD ONLY A FARMERS FOR ATTENDANCE UNCERTAINTY DO THE IMPACT OF THE PANDEMIC AND FUN GROW. OTHERWISE THE STATE COULD BE FACED WITH MID YEAR CUTS TO SCHOOLS OR LARGER DEFERRALS IN THE STATE IS ALREADY DIFFERENT MORE FUNDS FOR SCHOOLS THAN IT DID IN THE LAST RECESSION. IN ADDITION DUE TO THE POTENTIAL OF DISTANCE LEARNING IT'S DIFFICULT TO ACCURATELY TRACK EIGHTY EIGHT IN THE TWENTY TWENTY ONE FISCAL YEAR. LIKE MANY OF YOU WE HAVE HEARD CONCERNS FROM CHARTER SCHOOLS TO ANTICIPATE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN TWENTY TWENTY ONE DUE TO PARENTS CHOOSING TO MOVE STUDENTS THE CHARTER SCHOOLS DURING THE PANDEMIC AND FROM SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE IN AREAS WITH GROWING POPULATIONS. GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES IN HOW INSTRUCTION MAY BE PROVIDED THIS YEAR AND THE NEED FOR FLEXIBILITY PAIRED WITH LIMITED FUNDING. THIS IS A REASONABLE POLICY THAT PROVIDES FISCAL STABILITY TO THE ALLEY ACE. THERE ARE SOME ELEAZAR INCLUDING CHARTER SCHOOLS THAT MAY RECEIVE LESS HEALTHY AFFECTED ANTICIPATED THIS YEAR. HOWEVER KATIE TWELVE EDUCATION IS RECEIVING FIVE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS IN FUNDS ABOVE EL CFM. THE HELP WITH THE IMPACT OF COLD IT. TO HELP WITH THE IMPACT OF COLD WITH. WITH THAT WITH THE PRESIDENT I ASKED FOR AN AYE VOTE ON SB NINETY EIGHT CENTER WHICH WE REALLY APPRECIATE YOUR WORK BUDGET COMMITTEE'S WORK ON THIS DOCUMENT AND WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET COMMITTEE TO BE A TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS CENTER NIELSEN FLOORS OR SIR. THIS PRESIDENT LAYS DOWN THE SENATE I HAVE TO SOMEWHAT RELUCTANTLY RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS MEASURE. IT DOES CAPTION CHARTER SCHOOLS FOR. AND THERE'S IN MY OPINION HALF A REASON BEHIND IT THAT RELATES TO SOME OF THE- ADVOCATES FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. AND I DON'T THINK WE SHOULD DISADVANTAGE THE CHARTER SCHOOLS BECAUSE THEY MAY BE GAINING ENROLLMENT. IN THIS ALSO CAPS GROWTH FUNDING FOR BOTH. THE CHARTER SCHOOLS AND OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE WHEN THEY HAVE INCREASED ENROLLMENT. PRIOR IN PRIOR TO TWENTY NINETEEN TWENTY SO IT TO A DEGREE WELL. DISADVANTAGED SOME PUBLIC SCHOOLS NOT NOT A LOT INDEED BUT SOME. AND THAT PROVISION ITSELF I THINK IS CAUSE FOR CONCERN. AND I TRUSTED YOU'LL LIKE MYSELF WERE INUNDATED BY CALLS FROM CHARTER SCHOOL FAMILIES. WHO ENJOY THIS EDUCATION AND KNOWLEDGE BEING HELPFUL TO THEIR CHILDREN AND THEY WERE VERY ALARMED AN AGGRIEVED TO FIND THAT THEY WERE GOING TO. THE DISADVANTAGE YET AGAIN I ORIGINAL OF. THANK YOU SIR NIELSEN MEMBERS OF THE SENATE WE HAVE SEVERAL OF OUR COLLEAGUES WHO WOULD LIKE TO BE TO SPEAK THIS AFTERNOON WE'RE GONNA GO NEXT TO LEADER GROW INTO CENTER PORTANTINO SENATOR CHIANG SENATOR GLAZER IN CENTER RUBIO LEADER GROVE THE FLOOR IS YOURS GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL I DO APPRECIATE THE AT BUDGET'S HERE MAKING SURE THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS AND PUBLIC SCHOOLS WERE TREATED THE SAME- I DO REQUEST THOUGH BECAUSE WE DO NEED TO LOOK AT SOME THINGS DIFFERENTLY. FOR INSTANCE GREEN WAY SCHOOLS IN OUR DISTRICT KERN COUNTY IS A TWO TIER SCHOOL CHARTER NETWORK SERVING COMMUNITIES IN ARVIN AND SHAFTER. IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY NOW ALTHOUGH I REPRESENT A LARGE SWATH OF KERN COUNTY THESE PARTICULAR LOCATIONS IN MAJORITY MINORITY FARMING COMMUNITIES. ARE REPRESENTED BY MY COLLEAGUE WHO SHARES KERN COUNTY WITH ME. THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF CALIFORNIA IS THE FASTEST GROWING REGION IN THE ENTIRE STATE. KERN COUNTY WERE GRIMLY SCHOOLS IS LOCATED AT THE HIGHEST INCREASE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR TOTAL NUMBER OF SCHOOL AGE CHILDREN BASED ON THE MOST RECENT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REPORTING. IN THESE MAJORITY LET FARMING COMMUNITIES NO THERE CHILDREN ARE RIDING IN THIS EXCELLENT CHARTER- ENVIRONMENT THAT GRAHAM WAY PER FOUGHT PROVIDES. AND THE CAP ON THE SCHOOL GROWTH FUNDING IN SB NINETY EIGHT WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANTLY DETRIMENTAL IMPACTS ON THE SCHOOL YEAR FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE BUDGET. AND AT GROOM WAIT ACADEMY SPECIFICALLY IN SHAFTER WHICH AGAIN IS A MAJORITY MINORITY FARMING COMMUNITY. GREENWAY SCHOOLS POSITION APPROVED- THIS PETITION APPROVED BY RICHMOND UNIFIED SCHOOL DISTRICT AUTHORIZED OPENING THIS SCHOOL YEAR THE US OPEN IN THE SCHOOL WITH KATIE THROUGH FOURTH GRADE AND ADDING AN ADDITIONAL GRADE LEVEL EVERY YEAR AFTER THAT UNTIL THEY REACH THE EIGHTH GRADE. LEVEL AND IF THE CAPRI MEANS IN SB NINETY EIGHT THEY TEND TO LOSE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF RAP REVENUE- IN STATE FUNDING FOR THEIR SCHOOLS WHICH EQUATES AND SHE AFTER A LOAN OF JUST ABOUT THIS WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO OPEN THOSE HIGHER GRADE LEVELS AT TO MEET THE NEEDS OF THE COMMUNITY WHO IS DESIRING TO HAVE THEIR CHILDREN GET A BETTER EDUCATION- THAN WHAT THEY WERE GETTING IN TRADITIONAL PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THIS THE FOR THIS FORCE THEM TO MAKE EXCEEDINGLY DIFFICULT BUDGETARY DECISIONS IN THE UPCOMING SCHOOL YEAR- I WOULD ASK THAT THE STATE DEVELOP A FUNCTION TO ALLOW THE ELEAZAR. TO ALLOW LEDS WITH GROWING ENROLLMENT FROM PUBLIC AND IN PUBLIC AND CHARTER SCHOOLS- ALL THE NUMBERS POINT ESPECIALLY IN THESE MAJORITY MINORITY DISTRICTS. WHERE FAMILIES ARE TRADITIONALLY STUCK IN A ZIP CODE- THESE SCHOOLS ARE ACTUALLY IN THESE DISTRICTS AND PROVIDING A BETTER QUALITY EDUCATION FOR STUDENTS AND THEIR EXCEED THEIR EXCEEDING VERY WELL. IN GOING TO COLLEGE AND COLLEGE PREP CLASSES- IN KEEPING WITH THE SPIRIT OF PROP NINETY EIGHT AND EIGHT EIGHT SEVENTEEN. I BEGAN YOUR ZIP CODE SHOULD NOT REQUIRE YOU TO STAND LOW PERFORMING SCHOOLS AND IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE A TO THIS ISUE WITH GROWING STUDENTS GROWING- AND PARENTS GROWING TO HAVE THEIR STUDENTS GO TO A PUBLIC CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND I WOULD ASK CONSIDERATION FOR THAT AS WE MOVE FORWARD. THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR COMMENTS ARE NOT GOING TO GO TO CENTER PORTANTINO THE NEW CENTER CHANGE. THANK YOU MADAM PRESIDENT AND MEMBERS- I RISE IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY EIGHT. TODAY AND I HAVE TO COMPLEMENT OUR BUDGET CHAIR- AND OUR BUDGET SUB ONE CHAIR AS WELL FOR THEIR WORK ON PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OF COURSE. THE PRO TEM IN THE SENATE TO TEAM- I CAN'T TELL A LIE BUT I WAS SCARED THIS YEAR- THAT WE WORK IN A HOLD THE LINE ON EDUCATION FUNDING FOR THOSE OF US WHO WERE HERE BACK DURING THE GREAT RECESSION- EDUCATION. ROUTINELY GOT CUT WITHOUT MUCH THOUGHT WITHOUT MUCH PRIORITY TO SOLVE THE BUDGET CRISIS BACK THEN IT WAS DIFFICULT FOLKS WHO GOT UP AND TALKED ABOUT EDUCATION AND THE IMPORTANCE OF FINDING THAT GENERATIONS FUTURE- DIDN'T WIN THE CONVERSATION- AND SO THIS YEAR WHEN WE CAME OUT WITH A STRONG STATEMENT ON EDUCATION I WAS OF COURSE SUPPORTIVE OF IT BUT I WAS ALWAYS WORRIED THAT IN THE DAY- AT THE END OF THE DAY EDUCATION WOULD SUFFER. AND I'M PROUD THAT THE SENATE BUDGET ARCHITECTURE ONE THE CONVERSATION BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND SO I STAND IN SUPPORT OF SB NINETY EIGHT OF COURSE THERE ARE THINGS IN A BUDGET TRAILER BILL THAT THE NO NO SENATOR NOBODY. APPRECIATES AND A PROVES OF EVERY SINGLE. NOT A SOUL OF SOMETHING THIS COMPLEX IN THIS LARGE BUT OVERALL THE FACT THAT STABILITY. BECAME THE MANTRA THAT IT WAS WE KNOW THEY'RE GOING TO BE SIGNIFICANT. DECISIONS TO BE MADE NEXT YEAR AND HOW WE FIND GOVERNMENT HOW WE FIND EDUCATION BUT THIS YEAR WE CHOSE TO USE STABILITY. AS OUR OVERRIDING PRINCIPLE WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO YOU NEVER WANT TO SAY TO A SCHOOL THAT IS DRAWING MORE STUDENTS THAT IS IMPROVING- ITS ATTENDANCE NUMBERS THAT PEOPLE WANT TO GO. THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO RECOGNIZE THE ROLE THAT SCHOOLS THAT HAVE INCREASE ENROLLMENT HAVE- YOU KNOW THAT'S A TOUGH MESSAGE TO SAY TO SCHOOLS THAT ARE DOING WELL- BUT I THINK WE ALSO HAVE TO SAY. WE HEAR THAT WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE DEPRECIATE THAT AND LONG TERM WE NEED TO ADDRESS THAT IN A WHY ARE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES MOVING FROM RUN SCHOOL DISTRICT TO ANOTHER. THAT'S A VALID QUESTION THAT THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO ADDRESS I ALSO THINK WE HAVE TO TAKE THIS TIME OF COVE IT. COULD LOOK AT HOW WE FUND EDUCATION IS USING AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE THE RIGHT FORMULA SHOULD WE BE LOOKING AT NEW MODELS. POST CODE VISIT WITH THEIR SPLIT DAYS AND ENROLLMENT- DIFFERENCES ON MONDAY VERSES WEDNESDAY VERSUS FRIDAY WE HAVE TO BE CREATIVE AND THIS IS THE TIME TO DO IT SO ALL OF THOSE IDEAS. THAT HAVE BEEN PROPOSED TO REIMAGINE PUBLIC EDUCATION IN CALIFORNIA THIS IS THE TIME TO DO THAT RE IMAGINING THIS IS THE TIME BETWEEN THIS YEAR AND NEXT YEAR. TO COME UP WITH FUNDING MODELS THAT MEET. A TWENTY FIRST CENTURY EDUCATION SYSTEM AND NOT SOMETHING THAT WAS CREATED IN THE NINETEEN FIFTIES WHEN WE WERE A FARMING IN MANUFACTURING ECONOMY. THIS IS THE TIME TO REIMAGINE IT AND THIS IS THE TIME FRANKLY TO INVEST IN IT THIS YEAR WE HAD TO STABILIZE THE SYSTEM. AND I THINK WE DID THAT MUCH BETTER THAN I WOULD HAVE IMAGINED TWO MONTHS AGO AND AGAIN I COMPLEMENT OUR LEADERSHIP FOR MAKING THAT HAPPEN. AND I SAY TO ALL OF OUR EDUCATION ADVOCATES IN FUHRMAN'S WE HEAR YOU THAT ARCH IN MATTER. AND HOPEFULLY WILL SPEND THIS TIME TO REIMAGINE THEIR FUTURE AND HOW WE FUND THEIR FUTURE BETTER THAN WE ARE DOING IN THE PAST OR HAVE DONE IN THE PAST DECADE SO I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. AN AYE VOTE ON SB NINETY EIGHT THANK YOU CENTER PORTANTINO LADIES AND GERMS SENATE REGULAR CENTER CHIANG CENTER GLAZER. CENTER RUBIO AND SENATOR STERN'S CHAIN GOOD AFTERNOON. THANK YOU MISTER. MEMBERS FOR SOMEONE TO SAY THAT I APPRECIATE THE OF THE BY CHAIR AND THE COMMITTEE. UNFORTUNATELY I MUST RISE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BUDGET TRAILER BILL. IT IS FRUSTRATING TO SEE THIS PROPOSAL BEFORE US TODAY AS IT SEEKS OUT THE STUDENTS MOST IN NEED. AND THEN FREEZES THEM OUT OF THE BUDGET. PARENTS HAVE BEEN CALLING MY OFFICE PLEADING PLEASE DON'T PASS THIS BILL. I REALLY DON'T UNDERSTAND WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE. LAST WEEK WE PASSED A BILL THAT WOULD MOVE FROM THE CONSTITUTION OF PROHIBITION ON RACIAL DISCRIMINATION IN STATE GOVERNMENT. AND THIS WEEK WE'RE PULLING THE RUG OUT FROM UNDERNEATH MINORITY STUDENTS. SOME OF THESE CALLS ARE LIFELINE FOR LOW INCOME MINORITY AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. OF SCHOOLS IN ROMAN IS OFTEN GROWING AS A FUNCTION OF HOW WELL THE EDUCATE THEIR KIDS. DESPERATE PARENTS FIND THE SCHOOL SO THEIR CHILDREN HAVE A SHOT AT A GOOD EDUCATION. THIS BILL IS TURNING THOSE PARENTS AND THEIR KIDS AWAY WHAT ARE WE DOING HERE. I GET IT OUR ECONOMY HAS TAKEN A SEVERE HIT FROM THE PANDEMIC AND THAT WILL MEAN SOME CUTS BUT PLEASE DON'T TARGET THE STUDENTS. FIND THE SAVINGS ELSEWHERE THESE KIDS NEED OUR SUPPORT NOW MORE THAN EVER. IF WE WANT EQUALITY UNDER THE LAW TO VOTE FOR THIS BILL THIS BILL IS REALLY LACKING EMPATHY MEMBERS LET'S GO BACK TO THE DRAWING BOARD I ORIGINAL. YOU SAID. FIRST REMEMBER. CENTER GLAZER FOR HIS RESEARCH. THANK YOU OF THIS PRESIDENT MEMBERS I JOIN AND- EXPRESSING MY APPRECIATION TO THE BUDGET CHAIR AND SUBCOMMITTEE CHAIR AND ALL MEMBERS WHO WORKED SO HARD ON THIS PARTICULAR ISSUE EDUCATION WE KNOW IT'S THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE DO IS A STATE. IT IS PROBABLY THE MOST CHALLENGING TIME FOR US AND FOR OUR EDUCATION LEADERS FROM AROUND OUR STATE BOARD MEMBERS AND SUPERINTENDENTS HAVE CALLED MY OFFICE I'M SURE THEY'VE CALLED YOURS- THIS MEASURE HAS SEVENTY EIGHT DIFFERENT PROPOSALS AND- MOST OF THE MICE I AGREE WITH AND A FEW THAT I DON'T. BUT ON BALANCE I KNOW THAT OUR- LEADERS HAVE AS THE STRIVEN TO. CREATE THE- A BALLOT IT TO MOVE THIS FORWARD AND I THINK THIS BILL DOES DO THAT I WON A RECORD THE COMMENTS FROM THE SENATOR FROM SACRAMENTO IN THE SENATOR FROM RIVERSIDE DURING THE BUDGET DELIBERATIONS. ON THIS BILL AND IN PARTICULAR ON THE HOLD HARMLESS ISSUE IT IS A PROBLEM FOR MANY OF OUR DISTRICTS WHERE THERE HAS BEEN ENROLLMENT GROWTH FVE THREE SCHOOL DISTRICTS- THAT THAT. ENJOYED GROWTH FOR THE LAST THREE YEARS LIVERMORE VALLEY. JOINT UNIFIED BRENT WOODS ELEMENTARY IN DUBLIN UNIFIED. THEY HAVE PLANNED FOR THIS GROWTH. A HIRED STAFF FOR THIS GROWTH. AND UNFORTUNATELY THE BALANCING THAT'S IN THE BILL TODAY- IS GOING TO PENALIZE THOSE SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT HAVE ENJOYED THAT GROWTH BUT I RECOGNIZE. THAT IN MANY WAYS THIS BUDGET SITUATION COULD HAVE BEEN SO MUCH WORSE. AND I FEAR AS THE SENATOR FROM. BLOCKING YACHT I INDICATED THAT AS YOU LOOK TO THE FUTURE OF THESE BUDGETS FOR OUR SCHOOLS MAY GET EVEN MORE CHALLENGING SO DESPITE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL I'M- I AM I. GOING TO SUPPORT IT TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER GLAZER NOT GONNA RECOGNIZE RUBIO. THREATENING CENTER. THANK YOU MISS PRESIDENT AND CALL A I'LL- OF RICE SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. OF FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE BUDGET COMMITTEE AS WELL AS THIS WAS NOT AN EASY. EASY DECISION BUT I ALSO WANT TO. ACKNOWLEDGE THE WORDS OF MY GOOD FRIEND FROM LOCKING OUT A WHO STATED THAT STABILITY IN THESE TIMES UNCERTAIN TIMES IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. AND I WANT TO SHARE THAT I WAS A CLASSROOM TEACHER WHEN THE TWO THOUSAND EIGHT CUTS CAME. YOUR AND IT WAS SO DEVASTATING NOT ONLY TO OUR SCHOOL COMMUNITY ARE COMMUNITY SAID THAT IN LARGE BUT ALSO A TRICKLE DOWN TO OUR STUDENTS. COLLECTIVELY ARE SCORES DROPPED AND SO THAT JUST HIGH LIGHTS HOW IT DOES DIRECTLY IMPACT OUR STUDENTS. BUT I ALSO DON'T WANT TO MISS THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SAY TO ALL THE TEACHERS ADMINISTRATORS ARE SUPPORT STAFF. TAKE ON A TO EVERYONE THAT'S HOW TO SACRIFICE DURING THIS TIME. THAT WE ARE SO THANKFUL THAT YOU STEPPED UP. REMOTE LEARNING IS NOT EASY IT'S NOT SOMETHING THAT TEACHERS ARE PREPARED TO DO. AND DOT AND I FIVE REMEMBER THE TEACHER WE WERE NEVER TRAINED SELL FOR ALL THOSE TEACHERS OUT THERE. THERE ARE STEPPING UP AND DOING THE WORK WEEK THANK YOU. BUT AGAIN I WANT TO USE TO SAY THAT STABILITY WAS IMPORTANT. AND SO I DO RIGHT TO SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE THERE'S- AT LEAST A LOT OF THINGS THAT. I THINK IS ESSENTIAL- IN PARTICULAR EVERY JACK'S THE MAY REVISE. FIGURE CUTS TO CHILD CARE PROGRAMS IT DOES FUND BOB K. THROUGH TWELVE. AND THE ONE TIME FUNDS AT FIVE POINT THREE MILLION TO AT LEAST COVER AND TRY TO MINUTE MITIGATE SOME OF THE- THE ACT GAPS IN EDUCATION DUE TO CALL THAT IS REALLY REALLY IMPORTANT. I KNOW ONCE STUDENT BEHIND STILL DIFFICULT TO CLOSE THAT A- GAP. AGAIN COLLEAGUES. ASK FOR YOUR BIBLE THANK YOU SO MUCH. TWENTY SO MUCH WE'RE NOT TO GO TO SENATOR. AND SENATOR MORLOCK GOOD AFTERNOON TO RESTORE. FLOORS. BUT AFTER. GOOD AFTERNOON MR PRESIDENT. I READ IN SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE AND WANT TO GIVE US A SLIGHTLY FOR THAN IT THE ONE WE'VE SO FAR AND DOES I SHARE THE OF MIKE. IN THE IN THE WORK FROM OUR SENATE LEADERSHIP AND FOR LEADING ALL THE WAY IN TO MAKE PUBLIC EDUCATION. A CENTRAL PRIORITY IN THIS BUDGET AND- THE FRAMEWORK IS SOLID- WE'VE MADE PROGRESS HERE AND WE COULD NOT HAVE DONE THAT WITHOUT THE ADAM INSTEAD- WE CAN'T LET OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS COLLAPSE IN THIS CRISIS- HAVING JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE WITH A NUMBER OF MY SUPERINTENDENTS GO BOARD MEMBERS TEACHERS CLASSIFIED EMPLOYEES ARE TRYING TO PLAN IN THE NEXT. TWO WEEKS BROWSE STUDENTS ARE GOING TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL THIS FALL THEY'RE IN A BIT OF AN IMPOSSIBLE SITUATION- AND I WOULD JUST I WOULD SUGGEST THAT- WHAT WE'VE BEEN DISCUSSING THIS HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION AND REALLY FOCUSING ON THIS QUESTION OF. NEW SCHOOL DISTRICTS WITH. INCREASED ENROLLMENT AT THE UNCERTAINTY CLOUDING THIS SCHOOL YEAR WILL REALLY REQUIRE US TO TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AND LOOK AT THE TWENTY ONE TWENTY TWO SCHOOL YEAR. AND REALLY THAT THREE YEAR PLANNING HORIZON AND SAY. WE MAY HAVE TO ACTUALLY HOLD FOLKS HARMLESS FOR LONGER THAN THIS I DON'T WANT US TO LIMP INTO THIS VOTE- THIS KIND OF. EFFORT TO DEAL WITH THE UNCERTAINTY AND BUILD THAT INTO THE FORMULA I THINK IS REALLY CRUCIAL RIGHT NOW AND I WOULD SUGGEST THAT WE NOT ONLY TAKE A LOOK AT. EXPANDING UPON IT BUT REALLY TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE UNDERLYING. GRAY AREAS THAT ARE SET FORTH IN IN IN THIS BILL AND TRY TO GET SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY FOR OUR OUR OUR SCHOOL PUBLIC SCHOOL. LEADERS AROUND THE STATE ARE SPECIFICALLY THE REQUIREMENT THAT- I BELIEVE THAT THE BILL SAYS. A SCHOOL DISTRICTS ARE ELLIE ETS- SHALL REQUIRE IN PERSON INSTRUCTION TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT FEASIBLE. AT IT THAT'S THE SORT OF END OF THE SENTENCE. BUT WHAT IS TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT FEASIBLE WHAT KIND OF GUIDANCE ARE WE GIVING THEM WHAT LIABILITY FRAMEWORK ARE THE OPERATING WITHIN- TO ACHIEVE THAT MAXIMUM EXTENT. WE NEED TO GIVE MORE TOOLS TO OUR LOCAL SCHOOL DISTRICTS NOT JUST CAST HIS VOTE AND DO THIS TREMENDOUS BUDGET ACTION BUT TAKE THAT NEXT STEP TO WRITING CLARITY WE CAN'T JUST PUT UP OUR HANDS NAY IT NOW AND SAY THE JOB IS DONE SO. I WHOLEHEARTEDLY SUPPORT THE MEASURE AND ALL THE HARD WORK FROM OUR OUR SENATE TEEN- BUT I WE GOTTA KEEP GOING FURTHER BECAUSE IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PLAN. IN THIS UNCERTAIN BUDGET DYNAMIC WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO PROVIDE SOME ADDITIONAL CLARITY SO THAT. FAMILY AND PARENTS AND KIDS KNOW WHAT IT IS THEY'RE EVEN GOING BACK TO IN REALLY A MATTER OF WEEKS HERE. THANK YOU.

ADDRESS WAS THEN AB SEVENTY SEVEN WHICH IS THE- SAME BILL AS SB NINETY EIGHT WITH MINOR DIFFERENCES. ABOUT WHY WERE THEY CALLING BECAUSE HUNDREDS OF PARENTS WANT TO TRANSFER THEIR KIDS TO CHARTER SCHOOLS. AND AB SEVENTY SEVEN PREVENTS THEM FROM TAKING NEW STUDENTS. NOW KNOWN AS THE HOLD HARMLESS PROVISION. I APPRECIATE THE CHAIR OF. THE SENATE BUDGET IN THIS REVIEW. COMMITTEE TAKING SOME TIME TODAY ON THE FLOOR TO EXPLAIN THIS PARTICULAR- PROVISION- AND TO EXPLAIN THE ADA CAP THE AVERAGE DAILY ATTENDANCE. THE TERM WIFE FREEZE ATTENDANCE COUNTS. FOR PARTICULAR SCHOOLS VERSUS DISTRICT WIDE- MAYBE I'M MISUNDERSTANDING SOMETHING A COUPLE THINGS THAT WE'VE DONE IN OUR RESEARCH OF THE NINE HUNDRED AND FORTY FOUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS IS WE FOUND DOING REGRESSION ANALYSIS THAT CHARTER SCHOOLS WERE NOT HURTING DISTRICTS FINANCIALLY IF THEY HAD CHARTER SCHOOLS AND TWO WE HAVE A LOT OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS THAT ARE ACTUALLY DROPPING IN ENROLLMENT. SO THEREFORE IF ONE SCHOOL IN THE DISTRICT DROPS TWENTY STUDENTS AND THOSE TWENTY STUDENTS GO TO THE CHARTER SCHOOL THE NET ENROLLMENT IS THE SAME AND SO MAYBE WE COULD HAVE AN EXPLANATION AS TO ARE WE ARE WE USING SINGULAR WORDS- PLURAL WORDS FENCING CHARTER SCHOOL SINGULAR I'M SEEING CHARTER DISCAL DISTRICTS PLURAL AND IT'S A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO- UNDERSTAND BUT- IF PARENTS ARE OUR CUSTOMERS. AND MANY IN OUR STATE WANT AND DESIRE CHOICE WE SHOULD NOT BE LOCKING THE DOORS AND WE SHOULD BE TRYING TO DETERMINE HOW WE CAN ACCOMMODATE WERE POSSIBLE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT. I THINK I'LL BE.

ANY DISCO AND DIGITAL DISCUSSION OR DEBATE ON THE FLOOR. CENTER HERE WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE THANK YOU MISTER PRESIDENT MISTER PRESIDENT I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY AND- TO RESPOND TO A COUPLE OF THE QUESTIONS IN THE CONCERNS THIS OF THIS LEGISLATION. IS AND IT IS CORRECT- BY- BY THE GOOD SENATOR THAT IT WILL ONLY. GO INTO EFFECT IF P. JEANNIE DOES NOT SUCCESSFULLY EXIT FROM BANKRUPTCY AND ACQUIRE THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO PAY- FIRE VICTIMS AND TO MOVE FORWARD WITH THEIR RESTRUCTURING PLAN- SO THAT'S THE ONLY TO OR IF THEY FAIL AGAIN. BY CLOSING THE DEVASTATION OR DESTRUCTION THAT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE IN. QUALIFY WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK AND THE THRESHOLDS AND TRIGGER POINTS THAT THE UP OF THE P. SHE HAS ESTABLISHED IN P. GENIES EXIT PLAN WITH THEM. SECONDLY THE OF- THE PEACH THIS PARTICULAR OR AT THAT PARTICULAR TIME. IN PLACE NGUYEN P. JEANNIE FAILS OR NOT EXIT BANKRUPTCY THE P. YOU SEE WILL PUT THE COMPANY INTO RECEIVERSHIP. AND IN THAT RECEIVERSHIP OPPORTUNITY. DAY WILL HAVE THE- THE CHOICE OF PROVIDE PROVIDING OR OFFERING THE COMPANY TO NOT JUDGE GOLDEN STATE ENERGY BUT TO ANYONE WHO A PRIVATE COMPANY ANOTHER CORPORATION INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY WHATEVER IT IS THAT MAYBE INTERESTED. IN PURCHASING OR TAKING OVER. P. JEANNIE AT THAT TIME. OF THE OF THIS RELIGIOUS IS AN- THAT WE ARE THE ONLY ONE OR THAT WE ARE REQUIRED TO HAVE THIS ENTITY IN PLACE FOR P. JEANNIE TO EXIT BANKRUPTCY. THE BUSES YOU SURE THAT THERE. A AN- IN PLAY. THAT IS NOT AN INSTRUMENTALITY OF THE STATE. THAT CAN BE IN A POSITION AND WOULD BE IN A POSITION TO FACILITATE AN EASY TRANSITION. SURE THAT THE CUSTOMERS OF P. JEANNIE WILL BE MAINTAINED THAT THERE WILL BE AN ORGANIZATION IN PLACE THAT CAN CONTINUE WITH THE OFFERED UP THE- THE OPERATION OF PROVIDING A GOOD SOLID UTILITY OR GOOD UTILITY FOR CALIFORNIA. THE OTHER ASPECT OF THAT WAS REFERENCED BY OUR GOOD SENATOR FROM FROM RIVERSIDE. IF WE WANT TO. SPEND A FEW MORE MONTHS DISCUSSING THE CHALLENGES THAT P. JEANNIE FACED OVER THE LAST TWENTY OR THIRTY YEARS IN THE REASONS THAT THEY ARE IN THE POSITION THAT THEY'RE IN I THINK ALL WE HAVE TO DO IS LOOK AT THE FEDERAL CRIMINAL COURT THAT HAS THEM NOW UNDER SHOOT FOUND THEM GUILTY OF SIX FELONIES A NUMBER OF YEARS AGO AND THEY'RE STILL ON PROBATION TODAY OR THE WONDERFUL DISTRICT ATTORNEY. FOR THE COUNTY OF BUTTE WHO FOUND THEM GUILTY OF EIGHTY FIVE FELONIES. A YOU LOOK AT THE CRIMINAL BEHAVIOR OF THIS COMPANY HISTORICALLY- OVER THAT TIME PERIOD. YOU LOOK AT THE FACT THAT THE DIVERTED HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS. THAT WERE ATTRIBUTED SET ASIDE FOR SAFETY FOR MAINTENANCE. FOR OPERATIONS THAT MONEY WAS SET ASIDE BY THE PUBLIC UTILITIES COMMISSION THEY DIVERTED THAT THOSE FUNDS. TO BONUSES TO INCENTIVES. AND FOR PROFITS. BECAUSE THE ONLY WAY AN INVESTOR OWNED UTILITY CAN INCREASE THEIR PROFITS ABOVE THE RATE OF RETURN. IS TO CUT EXPENSES. AND THAT'S WITH THIS COMPANY DID. THAT'S WHY THEY WERE FOUND GUILTY THAT'S WHY WE NEED A BACKUP PLAN TO GO FORWARD I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR- WOULD CALL IT. CAN WE PLEASE CALL THE ROLL. OUR I ARE TO I AT AYE BELL HI FOR JUST.
