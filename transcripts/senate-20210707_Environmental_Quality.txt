WE HAVE A MOTION TO FOR THE CONSENT CALENDAR. MOVED BY OUR VICE CHAIR- CENTER BASE THE SENATE BATES WE HAVE A MOTION AGAINST MOVE THE CONSENT CALENDAR CONSULT PLEASE CALL THE ROLL ON THE CONSENT CALENDAR ITEMS ONE SEVEN AND EIGHT ALLEN HI I BATES BATES AYE DALLI DALLI AYE GONZALEZ SKINNER. AYE SKINNER AYE STERN Y. CASKEY. OKAY CONSENT ORDER HAS PASSED BUT- WE WILL LEAVE THE ROLE OPEN FOR THE MEMBERS OUT ON WE SEE WE WELCOME YOU HERE. ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT AB SIX FIVE TWO AND YOU MAY PROCEED WHEN READY THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS I WANT TO FIRST THANK YOU AND YOUR STAFF FOR THIS FOR YOUR WORK ON THIS BILL I WILL ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS ON PAGE NINE OF THE ANALYSIS. SB SIX FIFTY TWO WOULD PROHIBIT THE INCLUSION OF P. FAST CHEMICALS AND A WIDE RANGE OF JUVENILE PRODUCTS. SUCH AS SLEEP MATS NURSING PILLOWS CAR SEATS AND CRIBS MATTRESSES. THESE THESE CHEMICALS ARE OFTEN USED- WITH THE CLAIM THAT THEY MAKE PRODUCTS MORE STAIN RESISTANT ALTHOUGH THAT CLAIM IS FAIRLY DUBIOUS. AND YOU KNOW AS A MOM WHEN I BUY A MATTRESS PAD FOR MY DAUGHTER IN CALIFORNIA OR ANY PRODUCT THAT'S GONNA BE TOUCHING MY DAUGHTER'S SKIN AS A BABY. I ASSUME THAT IT'S COMPLETELY SAFE AND THAT ANYTHING THAT'S UNNECESSARY THAT HAS ANY CHANCE OF CAUSING HER HARM WOULDN'T BE THERE BUT UNFORTUNATELY THAT'S NOT THE CASE IN CALIFORNIA. BUT WE KNOW THAT P. FAST CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN SHOWN AND PROVEN TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON HUMAN HEALTH AND THAT THEY ARE ABSORBED THROUGH THE SKIN AND CERTAINLY THROUGH THE MOUTH AND ANYONE IS NOT A CHILD KNOWS THAT EVERYTHING GOES IN THEIR MOUTH- EVENTUALLY. IMPACTS TO ADULTS ALBUM HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO INCLUDE LIVER DAMAGE INCREASE RISK OF THYROID DISEASE AND DECREASED ANTIBODY RESPONSE TO VACCINES HEALTH IMPACTS THE CHILDREN INCLUDE SUPPRESSED IMMUNE SYSTEMS. IMPAIR KIDNEY FUNCTION AND DELAYED ONSET OF MENSTRUATION. A RESEARCH INTO THE STUDIES INDICATE THAT HEALTH EFFECTS ARE OCCURRING AT COMMON EXPOSURE LEVELS IN THE GENERAL POPULATION AND THESE CHEMICALS. ARE NOW FOUND TO BE PRESENT IN HUMAN BLOOD. DID HE A C. AS THE P. FAST HORRIBLE HEALTH AND THE NEEDS REMOVE FROM CERTAIN. SUCH AS CARPET. HOW MANY JUVENILE PRODUCTS AS DEFINED BY THE BILL CONTAINED FEW FAST. WHICH CAN MIGRATE INTO- CHILDREN THROUGH SKIN ABSORPTION AND THROOP DUSTS THAT THAT THAT COULD BE COMING OFF OF THESE PRODUCTS. AND THESE CHEMICALS ARE CERTAINLY NOT ESSENTIAL TO THESE PRODUCTS AND I WOULD MUCH RATHER HAVE A STAIN ON A BED SHEET OR INCLUDING THAT HAVE A OF CHEMICAL THAT'S HARMFUL IN MY DAUGHTER'S BLOOD STREAM AND- I JUST THINK IF PARENTS IN CALIFORNIA NEW. ABOUT THESE CHEMICALS IN THESE PRODUCTS THE REALLY BE OUTRAGE THAT WE ALLOW THIS TO HAPPEN IT'S NOT WHAT THEY EXPECT FROM CALIFORNIA PRODUCTS. HOW WE WORK WITH THE OPPOSITION AND WE'VE NARROWED WHAT IS CAN DISCONCERTED UNDER THE BILL AS A JUVENILE PRODUCT TO EXCLUDE CHILDREN ELECTRONICS MEDICAL DEVICES. AND INTERNAL COMPONENTS OF CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS AND ADULT MATTRESSES. THESE AMENDMENTS REMOVE THE OPPOSITION OF THE INTERNATIONAL SLEEP PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION AND ADVANCED MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. A RESTRICTION ON THE SALE OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS CONTAINING P. FAST IS THE ONLY WAY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS. TO PRODUCTS THAT ARE TRULY SAFE. AND I DON'T PRESENT A HEALTH RISK JUST FROM THEIR EXISTENCE IN THE HOME. AB SIX FIFTY TWO IS SUPPORTED BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS CAL CALIFORNIA. SMU A CALIFORNIA NURSES ASSOCIATION CLEAN WATER ACTION ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT. AND SAN FRANCISCO DEPARTMENT OF THE ENVIRONMENT AND MAY I SAY AS SOMEONE WHO SAT ON A WATER BOARD FOR FIVE YEARS. HE FASTENED THE WATER SUPPLY IS AN EMERGING CONTAMINANT AND A HUGE CONCERN FOR WATER AGENCIES WHO KNOW THAT THEY'RE GONNA BE ON THE HOOK FOR REMOVING THESE- THIS THE SUBSTANCE OUT OF THE WATER EVENTUALLY BECAUSE WE'RE ALL DRINKING THIS EVERY SINGLE DAY. THIS IS THE LOW HANGING FRUIT WHEN IT COMES TO REMOVING P. FAST CONTAMINATION. THAT IS EXPOSING OUR MOST VULNERABLE MEMBERS. I APPRECIATE YOUR THOUGHTFUL CONSIDERATION AND I WOULD URGE AN AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT I BELIEVE THAT- WE'VE GOT. TO ALLOW YOU TO SPEAK FIRST FROM A FROM A WORKING GROUP IN SUPPORT HI I'M BILL ALLEY- GOVERNMENT AFFAIRS DIRECTOR IN CALIFORNIA FOR THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND WE'RE SPONSORING THE BILL I WANT TO INTRODUCE FIRST DAVE ANDREWS PHD OF OUR STAFF HE'S GOING TO GIVE US A BRIEF- TESTIMONY ON THE SCIENCE OF P. FAST AND WHY THE CONCERN. DAVE THANK YOU AND I HOPE EVERYONE CAN HEAR ME- THANK YOU JOHN MEMBERS OF THIS COMMITTEE AND ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN FOR INTRODUCED IN THAT. THE BILL. MY NAME'S DAVID ANDERS I HAVE A PHD IN CHEMISTRY AND I'M A SENIOR SCIENTIST FOR ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP. I HAVE PUBLISHED NUMEROUS REPORTS AND WORKED ON OUR P. THOUGHT CONTAMINATION THAT. ALSO CO AUTHORED FIVE PEER REVIEWED PUBLICATION ON TEACH US THE CURRENT THAN HELP IT. FIFTY THOUSAND IN THE NATION AS THE NATIONAL PUBLIC ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH EMERGENCY AND URGENT ACTION IS NEEDED TO REDUCE AND ELIMINATE EXPOSURE AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. RECENT STUDIES INDICATE THAT HUMANS BOTH ADULTS AND CHILDREN ARE SUSCEPTIBLE TO. THE HEART COMPUBOX EXPOSURE. EXPOSURE LEVELS COMMON ALREADY IN THE GENERAL POPULATION ARE IMPACTING HEALTH. IN CHILDREN ARE PARTICULARLY VULNERABLE TO PEOPLE IT'S INTACT ESPECIALLY TO THE IMMUNE SYSTEM INCLUDING REDUCING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF VACCINES. AND HARM DURING CRITICAL PERIODS OF DEVELOPMENT. FOR THAT DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM HAS ALREADY CONFIRMED THAT P. FIVE OUR THREAT TO HELL. THEY HAVE ALSO DETERMINED THAT P. FIVE SHOULD BE REGULATED AS AN ENTIRE CLASS NOT JUST CHEMICAL BY CHEMICAL THIS REALLY INCLUDES THE FLOOR POMMEL MURDERS THE SHORT TERM REPLACEMENT CHEMICALS AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS OF THESE P. FIVE'S COMPOUND. IT IS BECAUSE OF THE URGENT HEALTH PRIORITY OF PROTECTING CHILDREN THAT HE W. AS PROUD TO SPONSOR EIGHTY SIX FIFTY TWO. THAT'LL LEMONADE THIS UNNECESSARY AND POTENTIALLY HARMFUL USE OF PEOPLE AND CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS. THESE PRODUCTS LEAD TO EXPOSURE THROUGH CONTACT WITH THE SKIN AND INHALATION OF DUST. AND EITHER CLICK CHEMICAL THE CULTURE EVER CHEMICAL THEY DO NOT BREAK APART IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THEY CAN BUILD UP IN PEOPLE. THESE ARE NOT CHEMICALS THAT BELONG IN OUR CHILDREN. MANY PEOPLE IT'S ACCUMULATING BLOOD AND THESE CHEMICALS ARE DETECTED IN NEARLY EVERY SINGLE PERSON IN THE COUNTRY. INCLUDING INTENT. I'VE SEEN EIGHTY SIX FIFTY TWO IMPORTANT STEP FORWARD IN REDUCING THIS REALLY UNNECESSARY EXPOSURE. AND WHAT THE CALIFORNIA IN THE LEAD OF PROTECTING OUR CHILDREN. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME TODAY. THANK YOU CAN I BILL ELLIOTT ENVIRONMENT WORKING GROUP WILL BE BRIEF WE WISH THE SAFER CONSUMER PRODUCTS PROGRAM AT DTS HE COULD HAVE A LIST AND BUT AND THEY WILL MAYBE SOME DAY BUT AS THE LEGISLATURE IS FINDING OUT THAT PROCESS IS GOING REALLY REALLY SLOWLY AND WE LIKE THE STAFF THERE IT'S A GOOD PROGRAM BUT SOMETIMES THE LEGISLATURE NEEDS TO STEP IN WHEN THERE'S A MORE URGENT PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUE AS THERE IS IN THIS CASE NATIONALLY WE'RE LOOKING AT TRYING TO HAVE ESSENTIAL USES ONLY OF THIS CHEMICAL FOR NOW. AND NONESSENTIAL USES SUCH AS CODING A CHILD'S A NURSING PILLOW OR CAR SEAT ELIMINATED- I WANT TO SAY THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST WORKING RELATIONSHIPS I'VE EVER HAD WITH THE OPPOSITION WE'VE WAITED THROUGH A LOT OF TOUGH ISSUES WE'RE DOWN TO SOME TECHNICAL LANGUAGE ON THE DEFINITION IN THE THRESHOLD THAT I THINK WE'RE GOING TO COME TO AGREEMENT ON REALLY SOON WE COULDN'T QUITE GET THERE BY TODAY BUT WE WELL I'M PRETTY SURE SO THANK YOU FOR YOUR SUPPORT.

WORKING WITH OUR COALITION INCLUDES SEVERAL AMENDMENTS SINCE THE BILL WAS INTRODUCED. AMENDED MATCHING THOSE US I WON'T NOT REITERATE- THE- IMPROVEMENTS IN OUR VIEW THE BILL- THUS FAR- AND REFLECTED IN THE ANNOUNCES ONE REMAINING ISSUE- OF THE SENATE IS THE DEFINITION OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED. SUBSTANCES WE HAVE BEEN IN DISCUSSION. ALUALU YOU AS TO WHETHER THIS DEFINITION COULD BE BETTER ALIGNED WITH OTHER. STATUTES THAT HAVE BEEN ENACTED. IN THE CHEMICAL BAY. OUT WE ANOTHER MEMBERS OF THE ARE CURRENTLY REVIEW FROM LANGUAGE SPOKEN LAST FEW DAYS. BASED ON A CLEAN PRODUCT INGREDIENT DISCLOSURE BILL AN ACT A FEW YEARS AGO. WE ARE STILL AWAITING FEEDBACK FROM ALL OF OUR INDUSTRY A COALITION STAKEHOLDERS. BY THIS LANGUAGE IS CERTAINLY- TRENDING IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION IN MY VIEW AND I AM VERY OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RECEIVING FINAL FEEDBACK. IN THE COMING DAYS. I DO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE AGAIN THE WILLINGNESS THE AUTHOR IN THE PROPONENTS TO ENGAGE IN A CONSTRUCTIVE DIALOGUE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK- YOU CENTER ALLEN COMMITTEE STAFF FOR YOUR ENGAGEMENT. WE ARE COMMITTED. TO RESOLVING THIS ISSUE AS THE BILL MOVES TO THE SENATE. I THANK YOU AGAIN FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY TODAY. THE TERM HOW WILL GO TO DANTE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS DON KHAKI WITH THE CUTE CAT CAN AFFECT IT ABOUT HALF THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION. WHICH YOU CURRENTLY HAVE AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON AB SIX FIVE ZERO FIVE THAT SAT J. IN LINE WITH YOUR SHOP COMMENTS SINCERELY APPRECIATE THE SIGNIFICANTLY HELPFUL AMENDMENTS TAKEN UP ALREADY AUTHOR IN THE- OR THE SCOPE OF WHAT WOULD CONSTITUTE A JUVENILE PRODUCT. WE ALSO GREATLY APPRECIATE THE ONGOING CONVERSATIONS REGARDING YOUR IRANIAN ISSUE AT THE MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY HAS NOT THE BILL NAMELY THE DEFINITION INTENSELY ADDED NOT WITHSTANDING OUR CURRENT CONDITION WE BELIEVE THE CONVERSATION HOUSE REFINEMENTS UNDER DISCUSSION ABOUT LEGISLATURE DIONYSIAN UNINTENTIONALLY ADDED ARE INDEED HAD ADDED A MORE WORKABLE DIRECTION IN MIND THE CURRENT INTENTIONALLY OUT OF PROVISIONS IN THE STATUTE TODAY. FURTHER DISCLOSURE OF PROHIBITED SUBSTANCES LEGISLATION TO THAT END THE NPA IS ALSO WORKING WITH A NUMBER OF COMPANIES THAT ARE HOPEFUL THAT WITH SOME REQUIREMENTS TO THE INTENTIONALLY ADDED DEFINITION CURRENTLY IN THE BILL ALONG THE LINES OF WHAT CURRENT DISCUSSIONS ARE HAPPENING BUT WE ARE HOPEFUL THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO REMOVE OPPOSITION TO AB SIX FIVE TWO IN THE COMING DAYS. I IN THE MEANTIME IT WOULD ALSO LIKE TO EXPRESS MY APPRECIATION TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER FRIEDMAN HER STOP AND- SEARCH FOR THEIR WILLINGNESS TO WORK WITH THAT AND THE MANUFACTURING COMMUNITY AND WE LOOK FORWARD TO THE STRATEGIST QUESTIONS THAT ARE HOPEFUL WILL BE ABLE TO GET TO NEUTRAL IN THE COMING DAYS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT OKAY. SO- LET'S GO TO FOR LINES TO FROM WHO WANT TO BE CONCERN ARE. TO THIS BILL AB. SIX TWO. TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION ONE ZERO AT THIS. ONCE AGAIN IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY NOW TO PRESS ONE THEN ZERO. WE HAVE A LINE QUEUING UP ONE MOMENT WHILE WE PROVIDE THEM THEIR LINE NUMBER. I'M MODERATOR ANY MINUTE NO ONE ELSE. YEAH WE DO HAVE A LINE IN Q. LINE ONE HUNDRED GO AHEAD PLEASE. MORNING SHARE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE ADAM WRIGLEY WITH THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE CURRENTLY HAVE A OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION BUT THAT WOULD BE UTHORS- INTEND TO WORK ON THE INTENSELY ADDED DEFINITION. WERE LIKELY TO MOVE TO NEUTRAL ONCE WE SEE THAT LANGUAGE IN CURRENT BUT- REALLY APPRECIATE WORKING WITH THAT THE OFFERINGS THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY IF. FEB HAVE BELIEVE AS JUST ONE PERSON MIND SO LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE LINE OVER THE LINES INTO SIR THANK YOU THANK YOU MATTER OKAY SO IT'S BEEN BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS THOUGHTS. I SEE ONE COMMENT OR QUESTION FROM SENATOR ALI. THANK YOU TAKE YOUR SHARE SO. I ACTUALLY JUST WANNA CLARIFICATION AND I KNOW WE WORKED ON P. VOSS. IN IT WAS LAST YEAR MAYBE THE YEAR BEFORE WITH YOU KNOW THE FIREFIGHTERS AND THEN TRYING TO. GIVE THEM AN OPPORTUNITY TO COME UP WITH NEW TECHNOLOGY TO COME WITHOUT THAT THE DEPTH OF THE TO IMPLEMENT IT SO IT WAS A PHASE IN TIME. BUT I MY QUESTION IS AND- FORGIVE ME FOR MIGHT BE NOT AS- EDUCATED ON THIS ISSUE AS I WANT TO BE- WHY DO WE HAVE TO HAVE PEOPLE AS IN THE FIRST PLACE WHAT IS IT IS ISN'T TERRIBLE I WANTED I RECALL AND- CORRECT ME IF I'M WRONG MAYBE ONE OF THE- WITNESSES COULD HELP ME OUT THAT THERE WAS. A TIME WHEN WE WERE TRYING TO STOP THINGS FROM BURNING IS FAST- AND THAT'S WHY IT WAS INCORPORATED INTO OUR- CHAIRS AND CARPET AND- CLOTHING- AND SO. IT IS THAT IS THAT THE CASE THAT WE HAVE THOSE SOME LAW IN THE BOOK THE SAYS SOMETHING CAN'T BURN AS FAST AS IT WOULD NOT OR WOULD OTHERWISE WITHOUT PEOPLE SENATE. SO THAT IF YOU CAME UP WITH FLAME RETARDANTS WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN REMOVED FROM CHILDREN'S PRODUCTS. THIS P. FOSS IS USED FOR EVEN A- YOU KNOW SORT OF LESS IMPORTANT REASON IT'S REALLY ROUTINELY BEEN SPRAYED ON A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS BECAUSE THEY THINK IT'S MAKES IT MORE STAIN RESISTANT. WHICH IS SOMEONE THAT HAS A LOT OF THESE PRODUCTS WILL TELL YOU I DON'T EVEN BELIEVE THAT- BECAUSE EVERYTHING GETS STAINED. BUT IT'S CERTAINLY THERE'S NO LAW THAT SAYS THAT. THAT THEY NEED TO. MAKE A CAR SEAT MORE STRAIN RESISTANT THERE'S FOR CLOTHING AND OTHER PRODUCTS ARE CERTAINLY OTHER MATERIALS THAT ARE USED BY A LOT OF INCOME COMPANIES IF YOU BUY ORGANIC MATERIALS A LOT OF TIMES THEY HAVE OTHER TYPES OF. YOU KNOW THINGS ON THEM THAT WOULD HELP MAKE IT A LITTLE SLICKER WHEN YOU WASH IT SO UNLIKE WITH FLAME RETARDANTS WHICH AT ONE POINT WHERE I THINK WERE MANDATED BY LAW. NONE OF THIS IS IMPACTED BY ANY REGULATIONS AND WE'VE EXEMPTED THINGS THAT WE THINK THERE IS AN ARGUMENT FOR SOME OF THE ELECTRONICS FOR INSTANCE AND- THINGS THAT ARE INSIDE- INSIDE THESE PRODUCTS SO. IF THAT YOUR QUESTION IF YOUR QUESTION IS WHETHER THEY'RE USING IT BECAUSE OF ANY LAW THAT REQUIRES THEM TO THE ANSWER IS NO. SO- SO THIS BILL BASICALLY IS DEFINING DOES IF IT WANTS TO WE ARE PROP SIXTY FIVE WHICH LATE THAT'S A LABELING ISSUE AND LETTING THE CONSUMERS KNOW WHAT THE RISK IS OF USING THE PRODUCTS SO THAT DOES NOT THIS BILL DOES NOT TOUCH THAT IS STILL GOING TO BE LABELED- THIS BILL BASICALLY IS NEARING IN ON THOSE- VERY. DEFINED PRODUCTS THAT ARE ONLY FOR CHILDREN CORRECT YOUR HEALTH PRODUCTS. SO PEOPLE ALSO STILL BE USED I AM PLEASED TO ANNOUNCE IS FOR ADULT MATTRESSES WHICH SO IF YOUR CHILD IS. SLEEPING WITH YOU IN YOUR BED YOUR THEY'RE STILL GOING TO BE. SUSCEPTIBLE TO THE PEOPLE ASSETS AND- ALL THE ADULT PRODUCTS CORRECT AND I THINK IT'S A REAL CONCERN. THANK YOU CHAIR THANK YOU- THE REQUESTED I MUST SAY ASSEMBLY MEMBER AT THAT POINT I NATIONALLY HEARD ABOUT THIS BILL AND ANOTHER SORT OF A KNOCKOFF OF GREEN CHEMISTRY WHILE I SHARE YOUR FRUSTRATION TED IT'S MOVING SLOWER THAN ALL OF US HAVE ANTICIPATED- IS STILL DOING GOOD WORK I THINK WHAT I HEARD TODAY AND FROM THE STAFF REPORT BECAUSE WHAT. WHAT MAKES. IT'S TO GIVE YOU THE BENEFIT OF MY THINKING THE- DGSE IS ALREADY MADE A DECISION ON THE RUGS AND CARPETS WHAT DID. A P. FAST AND I'VE ALSO MADE A DECISION ON. PLANT BASED FOOD PACKAGING SO THIS IS THIS IS GREEN CHEMISTRY WORKING AND NOW SAYING BECAUSE OF THE INFANT AND JUVENILE PRODUCTS WE WANT TO EXTEND THAT SCIENCE THAT WE HAVE DONE THAT BODY SCIENCE TO IT. I THINK THAT'S REFLECTED IN SOME OF THE OPPOSITION THAT HAVE SAID OKAY THAT'S A NATURAL PROGRESSION VERSUS JUST. WE THOUGHT WE JUST FOUND NEW CHEMICAL AND WE WANTED TO BE WE WANT TO GO TO THE FRONTLINE AND I. AND GREEN CHEMISTRY SO I APPRECIATE THAT I DID I'M SORRY I WASN'T HERE TO BEGINNING BUT I DID HEAR SOME. BECAUSE THE THINGS THAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT THE- INTENTIONAL- N. IF I IF I COULD HEAR FROM YOU I'M SORRY IF IT'S REPETITIVE VALERIE MENTION THAT YOU REMARKS WHERE DO YOU THINK THAT THAT'S COULD LAND. ON IT'S NOT. IT'S IT IS IT THE NATURALLY OCCURRING INTENTION. OR IS IT THAT THAT'S ADDED TO THE PRODUCTS- FOR THESE JUVENILE PRODUCTS. YEAH I WELL WE HAVE TAKEN- THE LANGUAGE THAT WE TOOK FROM THE COMMITTEE WAS TO GIVE MORE CERTAINTY TO THAT MANUFACTURERS IN THAT REGARD. SO THAT THEY FELT THAT THEY WOULDN'T BE- SORT OF. THEY WOULD NEVER PUNITIVE ACTION AGAINST THEM WHEN THEY DID NOT KNOW THAT THERE WAS PEOPLE ALSO WAS NATURALLY OCCURRING. OR THERE WAS OTHER KIND OF CONTAMINATION. SO WE'RE HOPEFUL THAT THAT WILL REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION AS YOU HER I DON'T KNOW IF YOU WERE IF YOU WERE CAME IN AS THEY WERE SPEAKING. THEY CERTAINLY HAVE TO GO BACK TO THEIR MEMBERS TO. MAKE SURE THAT ALL OF THEIR ISSUES ARE ADDRESSED AND YOU KNOW WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS WORKABLE FOR INDUSTRY AS WELL- THE SO- YOU KNOW I THINK THAT THEY'RE JUST CONCERNED ABOUT LIABILITY WHEN THEY IF THEY MAKE ALL THE BEST EFFORTS TO MAKE SURE THAT. THAT THIS MATERIAL IS NOT THERE. AND IT COMES FROM THE INSIDE OF THE PRODUCT OR SOMETHING HAPPENS THAT THEY'LL HAVE A CHANCE T CORRECT THAT. AND IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE LARA LANGUAGE THAT DAY THAT WE HAD CORRECT IN YOUR SYSTEM THAT LIKE EVERYBODY KNOWS THAT. THEY UNDERSTAND THEY KNOW HOW TO WORK WITHIN SO- WE'VE BEEN YOU KNOW WE REALLY HAVE BEEN WORKING VERY HARD TO REMOVE. THE SMALL AMOUNT OF OPPOSITION THAT THEY HAD AND I WOULD LIKE TO THIS POINT OUT THAT THEIR OPPOSITION WAS NOT ABOUT THE INTENT OF THIS BILL. I WILL GIVE INDUSTRY A LOT OF CREDIT FOR SAYING HEY WE GET THAT THIS IS A PROBLEM WE DON'T WANT TO SEE THIS ANYMORE EITHER WE UNDERSTAND THE EMERGING. DATA SCIENCE ABOUT THE RISKS OF THIS WE WANT TO GET THIS OUT OF OUR PRODUCTS NOW WE JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. YOU KNOW THAT WE DO IT IN A WAY THAT WE THAT. WE CAN ACHIEVE SO THEY'VE BEEN REALLY GOOD ABOUT WORKING WITH US ON THAT. I'M OF THE BILL. THE SENATE. THIRTY DOLLAR. THE FOLLOW UP. THAT'S VERY GOOD INFORMATION AND- BOB BILL LATE IT FREES THERE USING RECYCLED MATERIAL HAD THE PEOPLE SENATE BEFORE THE I MEAN THEY THEY NEED TO BE HELD HARMLESS TO TRY DOING THE BEST EFFORT TO ELIMINATE THE PRODUCTS AND SO- I COMMENDED THE ABILITY TO WORK TOGETHER I'M ONLY OFF THE BUILDING TO SEE WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO PROCS NEXT I BELIEVE. THERE WAS A- IT- I THINK ONE OF FOR. SO ARE YOU GONNA BE TAKEN MINUTES BEFORE THE FLOOR WELL WE FIRST WANT TO SEE IF THEY- AGREED TO THE LANGUAGE THAT WE PUT IN IT'S POSSIBLE THAT THEY'RE GOING TO YOU KNOW DO THEY DO THAT DEEP DIVE INTO THE LANGUAGE GO BACK TO THE MEMBERS AND COME BACK AND REMOVE THEIR OPPOSITION THAT'S OUR HOPE. OKAY THANK YOU. OKAY BRADFORD BATES I JUST SAYS CLOTHING I JUST WANT TO THANK OUR- ASSEMBLY WOMAN. FRIEDMAN FOR THE WORK ON THIS BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE RAISED A SIGNIFICANT ISSUES AND ALL OF US AS PARENTS. YOU KNOW HAVE THOSE LITTLE GUYS. ALONG THE WAY THIS IS SOUND REALLY. SCARY TESTIMONY THAT THESE ARE THINGS THAT WILL AFFECT THEM I'M GONNA LAY OFF TODAY BUT I WANT TO COMMEND YOU FOR. THE WORK YOU'VE DONE AND I THINK BY THE TIME IT GETS TO THE FLOOR IF IT'S ON THE PROBES. WE DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENS IN APPROACH THAT COULD BE SUSPENSE BUT- I'D- I WILL. MOST LIKELY BE THERE ARE FOR THE MOST IMPORTANT VOTE. THANK YOU AND YOU'VE DONE A GREAT JOB ON THIS. THANK YOU SENATOR. GREAT THANK YOU. WE'LL SEE ANOTHER COMMENTS ONE THIRTY OUT FOR. HER WORK ON THIS. IMPORTANT ISSUE AND SO MANY OTHERS AND IT'S BEEN MOVED BY SONORA CASKEY WILL LET YOU CLOSE THIS SUMMER. THAT'S ALL I JUST A YOU KNOW POINT OUT WE HAVE. ON THE FLOOR WE HAD NO NO VOTES ON THE VOTE ON THE BILL AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THE SUPPORT OF COMMENTS AND WE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH WITH INDUSTRY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THIS IS DOABLE FOR THEM. SO THANK YOU THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED TO CONSULT PLEASE KALRA. ITEM NUMBER TWO AB SIX FIVE TWO BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER FRIEDMAN THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED. ALAN HI. ALAN HI BATES. DALLY GONZALEZ SKINNER STERN Y. CASKEY HI I. CASKEY I'M- REALLY THE ROLE OPEN FOR FOLKS THAT HONESTY SILVA- BLOOM HERE HE CAN PRESENT AB TEN SIXTY SIX. A VERY IMPORTANT NUMBER FOR A- FOR BRITS. THE BATTLE OF HASTINGS. SO- YOUR EYES ONE APPRECIATE- YOUR YOUR TO CHOOSING THAT FOR TWO IT IS NUMBER MY FATHER WHO MAY BE WATCHING THIS HEARING IS- IS PLEASED. MISTER ALONE SO LET'S HEAR FROM USING YOUR DATA MAY BE MORE IMPORTANT THAN THAT PLEASING YOU MISTER CHAIR YES. THAT'S RESERVE. FIVE MAY I PROCEED YES PLEASE THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR YOUR CO AUTHORSHIP OF THIS BILL AND JENNIFER IT'S BECAUSE OF ME BECAUSE OF THE NUMBER. OF HI AND I WOULD ALSO THINK OF COURSE COMMITTEE STAFF- WHOSE EFFORTS HAVE BEEN DILIGENT TEND TO- WE FIVE. WORK WELL IN THE BAG- I KNOW THAT- YOUR STAFF IS ALSO WORKED WITH OUR SPONSOR HEAL THE BAY. THE AB TEN SIXTY SIX PROTECT PUBLIC HEALTH BY TAKING THE FIRST STEPS TO CREATING A UNIFORM SET OF STATEWIDE MONITORING STANDARDS AND PROTOCOLS FOR TESTING BACTERIA IN PRIORITY FRESH WATER BODIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE. UNLIKE OUR COASTAL WATERS CALIFORNIA'S RIVERS LAKES AND STREAMS ARE NOT MONITORED FOR RECREATIONAL WATER QUALITY IN THE SAME MANNER AS OCEAN BEACHES. IN ADDITION THE SMALL AMOUNT OF DATA AND MONITORING THAT IS DONE IT IS MOST OFTEN NOT CURRENT OR READILY AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. BECAUSE RIVERS LAKES AND STREAMS ARE NOT BEING ROUTINELY MONITORED THOUSANDS OF VISITORS TO FRESH WATER RECREATION SITES MAY BE UNWITTINGLY EXPOSED TO CONTAMINATED WATER. RATHER THAN ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH AN STATUTE WHICH SITES NEED TO BE TESTED AB TEN SIXTY SIX REQUIRES THAT THE CALIFORNIA WATER QUALITY MONITORING COUNCIL. BY JULY FIRST TWENTY TWENTY TWO DIRECT A NEW OR EXISTING WORKING GROUP TO STUDY WATER RECREATION HAZARDS AT PRIORITY WATER CONTACT RECREATION SITES. THE WORKING GROUP IS TO CONDUCT THOSE STUDIES OVER A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD BEFORE SUBMITTING A REPORT OF THEIR FINDINGS TO THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD THE COUNCIL WILL THEN IN COLLABORATION WITH THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH LOCAL HEALTH OFFICERS AND THE PUBLIC PROPOSED TO THE STATE WATER BOARD TO CONSIDER A DEFINITION OF MONITORED FRESH ROCK FRESHWATER RECREATION SITE AND THE SHOULD HAPPEN ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER THIRTY FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY THREE. AB TEN SIXTY SIX IS MODELED AFTER A B. FOUR ONE ONE WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN. AND ESTABLISHED REQUIREMENTS FOR REGULAR STATE AND LOCAL MONITORING OF COASTAL WATERS. AND INFORM THE PUBLIC WHEN THE WATERS POSED A HEALTH HAZARD. AND LET ME POINT OUT THAT THIS IS NOT A COSTLY NEW STATE PROGRAM WHAT IT DOES IS BUILD ON WORK THAT'S ALREADY BEING DONE BY THE S. W. R. C. B. AND MANY PUBLIC PRIVATE AND PRIVATE AND PRIVATE. SECTOR FRESHWATER RECREATION SITE MANAGERS BY IMPROVING GREATER CONSISTENCY AND TRANSPARENCY. CURRENTLY THOSE PUBLIC CA AND PRIVATE MANAGERS I JUST DON'T HAVE CONSISTENT TESTING PROTOCOLS AND METHODOLOGIES. AB TEN SIXTY SIX FIXES KEY ELEMENTS OF THIS HEALTH PROBLEM BY ESTABLISHING UNIFORM MONITORING STANDARDS WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING INEQUITY ISSUE INLAND AREAS SHOULD BE AFFORDED THE SAME PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS AS COASTAL AREAS. WE RECOGNIZE. I SHOULD SAY OF COURSE ARE THERE ARE MILLIONS OF CALIFORNIANS AND VISITORS WHO RELY ON FRESH WATER BODIES LIKE LAKES RIVERS AND STREAMS FOR RECREATION AND THEY SHOULD HAVE THE SAME PROTECTION THAT FOLKS WHO HAD OUT TO OUR BEACHES HALF THE BEACH MONITORING PROGRAM HAS BEEN A RESOUNDING SUCCESS AROUND THE STATE- AND WE KNOW THAT- MISTER CHAIR UNITE- BECAUSE IT'S BEEN A SUCCESS RIGHT AT HOME IN OUR BEACH AND US. IN SANTA MONICA WHERE WE NOW UNDERSTAND THE WATER QUALITY ISSUES- POOR WATER QUALITY ISSUES FRANKLY THAT CAME FROM STORMWATER RUNOFF THAT CAME FROM RESIDUE THAT WAS COMING OFF OF THE SANTA MONICA PIER ONCE YOU KNOW THOSE THINGS YOU CAN LET PEOPLE KNOW WHEN THEY'RE BAD WHEN THEY'RE PROBLEMATIC SO THAT SURFERS AND- BAY THIS CONSPIRATORIAL- AND IT ALSO ELEVATES PUBLIC UNDERSTANDING ABOUT THE- THE ISSUE- AND MOTIVATES. LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THE STATE TO TAKE ACTION TO CLEAN UP THE PROBLEMS WHICH WE'VE DONE IN SANTA MONICA TO GREAT EFFECT. YEP WE RECOGNIZE THE TEN SIXTY SIX IS A WORK IN PROGRESS AND IS ONLY THE FIRST STEP IN ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE THE BILL WILL ADDRESS A KEY PUBLIC HEALTH CHALLENGE THAT MANY CALIFORNIANS FACE AN OUTDOOR RECREATION ENSURING THAT THERE ARE SIGNS AND HEALTH BASED MICROBIOLOGICAL STANDARDS ONGOING WATER QUALITY MONITORING AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION FOR FRESH WATER RECREATION WHERE NEEDED CALIFORNIA IS A MAGNIFICENT STATE ONE THAT AFFORDS ALL OUR COMMUNITIES WITH OPPORTUNITIES TO RECREATION OUTDOORS NOT TO MENTION THOSE WHO COME. TO VISIT OUR GREAT STATE. POSTED ENSURE LAKES RIVERS AND STREAMS DESERVE THE SAME ASSURANCES THAT FRESHWATER SITES ARE SAFE TO SWIM AND JUST AS THOSE WHO ENJOY OUR COASTAL BEACHES. CALLING IN TODAY TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL ARE KATHERINE PEASE DIRECTOR OF SCIENCE AND POLICY IF YOU'LL THE BAY AND MATTHEW THOMAS OUTREACH ASSOCIATE AT ACTIVE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. PLEASE PROCEED WITH THEIR WITNESSES. THIRTY CATHARINE. THANK YOU. THE MORNING CARE ALLEN AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS DR CATHERINE P. IS AND I'M THE DIRECTOR OF FINE QUALITY AN OUTREACH AND HEAL THE BAY. OKAY IS PROUD TO BE SPONSORING AB TEN SIXTY SIX WITH ASSEMBLY MEMBER BLOOM AND GREATLY APPRECIATE SHARE ALLEN CO AUTHORSHIP. OVER THE RECENT HOLIDAY WEEKENDS PEOPLE ALL ACROSS CALIFORNIA FLOCKED TO BEACHES AND RIVERS TO COOL OFF AND ENJOY TIME WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY. HOWEVER CALIFORNIANS WHO WENT TO OCEAN BEACHES WERE AFFORDED MORE PROTECTIONS REGARDING WATER QUALITY AND THOSE WHO WENT TO FRESH WATER RECREATION SITE LIKE RIVERS CREEKS COMPLAINING ALL. THE WATER IN MANY OCEAN BEACHES CAPTAIN REGULARLY FOR BACTERIAL POLLUTION AND THAT INFORMATION IS MADE AVAILABLE TO THE PUBLIC. THE SAME IS NOT TRUE BURKE FRESHWATER RECREATION SITE. AB TEN SIXTY SIX TAKES THE FIRST IMPORTANT STEPS IN ADDRESSING THIS DISPARITY. HILDA MAY LEAD THE EFFORT OVER TWENTY FIVE YEARS AGO GET BASIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS FOR OCEAN BEACH GOERS. THANKS TO A BEFORE ELEVEN WHICH PASSED THE NINETEEN NINETY SEVEN VISITORS TO OVER FIVE HUNDRED OF CALIFORNIA'S BELOVED BEACHES ARE BETTER PROTECTED BECAUSE THEY ARE INFORMED ON THE AMOUNT OF BACTERIAL POLLUTION IN THE WATER. INCREASED AND STANDARDIZED MONITORING AT OUR BEACHES HAS LED TO FURTHER LEGISLATION THAT PROVIDED FUNDING FOR PROJECTS. TO IMPROVE WATER QUALITY AND FURTHER PUBLIC EDUCATION THAT KEEPS PEOPLE SAFE. SO THE BAY IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM IS NOW LEADING THE EFFORT TO ACHIEVE HEALTH PROTECTIONS FOR VISITORS TO FRESHWATER SITES. AB TEN FIFTY SIX WHAT PASSED THE CALIFORNIA WATER QUALITY MONITORING COUNCIL BUT DEFINING AND IDENTIFYING PRIORITY FRESHWATER RECREATION RIGHT ACROSS THE STATE. AS WELL AS MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS FOR AN APPROPRIATE MONITORING PROGRAM FOR THE SITE. THIS IS NOT A MONITORING AND PUBLIC NOTIFICATION MANDATE LIKE IT BEFORE ELEVEN BUT IT IS A CRITICAL FIRST STEP IN ACHIEVING THOSE HEALTH PROTECTIONS FOR FRESH WATER. CHILDREN MAY SUPPORT THE RECENT AMENDMENTS TO THE BILL NAMELY EXPANDING TO MORE BROADLY ADDRESSED MICROBIOLOGICAL STANDARDS. FOCUSING EFFORTS ON OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES AND SHIFTING FROM HIGH USED TO PRIORITY APPROACH. WE LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND THE AUTHOR TO ENSURE THAT THERE IS WIDESPREAD SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL. AB TEN SIXTY SIX THE FIRST STEP TOWARDS PROTECTING ALL CALIFORNIANS FROM POLLUTION AT THEIR FAVORITE SWIMMING HOLE. IN IT HAS THE POTENTIAL TO INSPIRE MORE HEALTH PROTECTION AND WATER QUALITY IMPROVEMENTS AS WE HAVE SEEN AT OUR OCEAN BEACHES. WE URGE YOU TO VOTE YESTERDAY ON AB TEMP SIXTY SIX THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S MAKE SURE FOR MATTHEW THOMAS. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING CHALLENGE AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MY NAME IS MATTHEW THOMAS I'M AN OUTREACH SERVICE YET ACTIVE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY A PLACE BASED NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION HEADQUARTERED IN THE CITY OF EL MONTE. ACTIVE STV'S MISSION IS TO SUPPORT A MORE SUSTAINABLE EQUITABLE AND LIVE THE LIVABLE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. BASIC ELEMENTS OF A LIVABLE COMMUNITY INCLUDE CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER. THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IS HOME TO A WATERSHED WITH OVER ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY MILES OF RIVERS STREAMS AND WASHES THE LARGEST OF THESE THANK GABRIEL AND REAL ON THE RIVERS. SERVICE SIGNIFICANT RECREATIONAL. AREAS FOR A JEEP AND PARKOUR AND POLLUTION BURDEN COMMUNITIES. ACTIVISTS TV STRONGLY SUPPORTS A. B. TEN SIXTY SIX BECAUSE IT TAKES THE NECESSARY FIRST STEPS IN ADDRESSING THE CASE THE EXISTING PUBLIC HEALTH DISPARITY IN CALIFORNIA BETWEEN PROTECTIONS ACCORDED TO OCEAN BEACH GOERS. AND THOSE AFFORDED TO VISITORS BY RIVERS STREAMS AND LAKES- OCEAN BEACHES WITH A CERTAIN NUMBER OF VISITORS AND PROXIMITY TO STORM DRAINS REQUIRE REGULAR TESTING OF THE WATER FOR BACTERIAL POLLUTION AS WELL AS PUBLIC NOTIFICATION. THE WATER QUALITY. TODAY PEOPLE STILL GET SICK FROM FRESHWATER RECREATION BECAUSE CALIFORNIA'S ICONIC RIVERS LAKES AND STREAMS ARE NOT MONITORED CONSISTENTLY BACTERIAL POLLUTION. THE REQUESTED BY THE CDC AND ACADEMIC RESEARCHERS INDICATES THAT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE ACROSS CALIFORNIA GET SICK FROM FRESHWATER RECREATION EVERY YEAR. FOR CALIFORNIANS WHO DO NOT LIVE NEAR THE COASTER FOR WHOM THE COAST IS NOT EASILY ACCESSIBLE INLAND FRESHWATER AREAS PROVIDE ESSENTIAL RECREATIONAL SPACE FOR SWIMMING WEEDING AND OTHER FORMS WATER CONTACT RECREATION. CALIFORNIANS TO USE THESE WATERWAYS SHOULD BE PROVIDED WITH THE SAME PROTECTIONS AT OCEAN BEACH GOERS ARE GIVEN. WE WORRY THAT THE CURRENT LACK OF PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION BE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACT DISEMPOWERED COMMUNITIES OF COLOR RECREATION LAKES RIVERS AND STREAMS. WE SUPPORT THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE BILL PARTICULARLY THE AMENDMENT INCLUDING OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES AND THE CRITERIA FOR DEFINING A PRIORITY WATER CONTACT RECREATION PLACE. ACTIVIST U. V. BELIEVES THE TEN SIXTY SIX WILL BE A CRITICAL STEP FORWARD IN MAKING IN MANY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA INCLUDING THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY IN ITS WATER BODIES.

YOU WOULD LIKE TO EXPRESS OPPOSITION PRESS ONE THEN ZERO AT THIS TIME. ONCE AGAIN TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION PLEASE TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY NOW TO PRESS ONE THEN ZERO ON YOUR PHONE. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE KNOWN QUEUED UP THANK YOU LET'S BRING THE ITEM BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS THOUGHTS COMMENTS. CENTER DOLLY. THANK YOU SENATOR BOOM FOR BRING THIS FOR I HAVE A FEW QUESTIONS ON THE DETAILS OF HOW IT'S GOING TO ROLL OUT SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS. LAKE TAHOE AND- THOUSANDS OF MILES OF RIVERS THAT RUN. AND STREAM THAT RUNS REGISTER CAL HOUSING- SO WITH THIS BILL- OBVIOUSLY FOR THE BEACHES IT'S PRETTY EASY THERE'S ONE COASTLINE AND BUT THERE'S LOTS OF TRIBUTARIES THAT BRANCH OFF THROUGHOUT THE DAY MY DISTRICT WHAT WHAT DO YOU THINK THE PROCESS IS GOING TO LOOK LIKE I MEAN AND THIS BILLS LIKE GIVING SOME GUIDANCE TO THE WATER BORDER LIKE DETERMINE- SO WHAT'S THE DEFINITION OF A BEACH WHAT'S THE DEPOSITION OF THIS OF COURSE SO I GUESS FOR ME IT'S LIKE. WHO'S GOING TO DO WHAT AND- HOW THE PROCESS GOING TO GO FORWARD. WELL UNDER THE BILL THE WATER BOARD IS SET- CHARGED WITH SETTING UP THAT PROCESS AND CARRYING IT THROUGH AND WE PROVIDE. SOME GUIDANCE AND TIME LIMITS- TO GET WITHIN WHICH THAT WORK IS TO BE DONE. I THINK FOR MORE DETAIL PROBABLY- A DOCTOR PIZZA AT HEAL THE BAY MAY BE ABLE TO ADD SOME ADDITIONAL DETAIL. SURE I CAN ADD TO THAT THANK YOU. SO IN TERMS OF THE ATTENDING THE DEFINITION I THINK THERE IS SOME SUGGESTION AND SOME SUGGESTIONS AND THE BILL LANGUAGE WHERE INDIFFERENT CRITERIA COULD BE TAKEN INTO ACCOUNT TO- SET FORTH WHAT WOULD BE A PRIORITY RECREATION PLIGHT THE CLEARLY IT WE WOULDN'T EXPECT MONITORING TO HAPPEN AT. YOU KNOW EVERY SINGLE SITE ON THE RIVER WHERE THERE'S ANY SORT OF RECREATION BUT WE WOULD TRY TO PRIORITIZE THOSE AREAS THAT WOULD BE BASED ON THINGS LIKE. HOW USE THEY GET WHETHER THEY'RE IS I THANK WATER CALL CONCERNS. WHETHER THERE IS A LOCATION THAT ARE USED FOR A COMMERCIAL. ENDEAVORS LIKE. RAFTING OR OTHER KINDS OF THINGS LIKE THAT AS WELL AS THE IT BY OVERBURDENED COMMUNITIES SO. THAT THE IN THE CALIFORNIA WATER QUALITY MONITORING COUNCIL WOULD SET UP A WORK GROUP THAT WOULD WORK THROUGH THOSE ISSUES IN TERMS OF WHAT WOULD BE THE CRITERIA THAT WOULD QUALIFY. RIGHT TO. I'VE ACTUALLY BE MONITORED. THAT WOULD BE SAFE TO SAY. A LONG MOST OF THESE TRIBUTARIES THERE RT THERE'S A LOT OF MONITORING GOING ON ALREADY FOR THE OXYGEN AND- FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE DROPPING OUT OF THE SO WITH THAT INFORMATION IS ALREADY AVAILABLE STE BE USED TO DETERMINE WHETHER YOU. NEED EVEN GOING FURTHER. WHAT I'M LOOKING FOR THAT ONE ANOTHER LAYER OF BUREAUCRACY ON TOP OF WHAT WE ALREADY HAVE. A LOT OF MONITORING GOING ON IT MOST OF THE STREAMS AND RIVERS IN MY DISTRICT HAVE. A MUNICIPALITIES THAT ARE PULLING OUT OF THOSE OR PUTTING STUFF BACK IN AND THEN WE HAVE MONITORING THAT'S IT ALREADY AVAILABLE THAT WE WOULD NOT REQUIRE A NOTHER. AND THEN THERE'S RECREATION ALONG THOSE TRIBUTARIES THAT WE WOULD NOT REQUIRE THAT THAT WOULD BE SUFFICIENT IF THEY USE THE MONITORING THE PROBLEM THOSE MINUTES APOLOGIES. THE BILL ACTUALLY KNOWLEDGE IS THAT THAT IS- HI IN FACT THE CASE- HOWEVER WE KNOW THAT OTHER MONITORING CUT THAT'S GOING ON IS NOT ALWAYS CONSISTENT STANDARDS SO ONE OF THE EFFORTS HERE SHOULD BE TO- I HAVE A CONSISTENT SET OF STANDARDS SO THAT ONE GOES FROM ONE. AREA TO THE NEXT- YOUR- YOU'RE GETTING A REPORT THAT HAS SOME CONSISTENCY. TO IT. HI AND- SO I THINK THAT'S AT LEAST PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO YOUR TO YOUR QUESTION. THANK YOU. SENATE BATES A YEAR FOR THANK YOU I THINK CONSERVE CONCEPTUALLY ASSEMBLY MEMBER BILLION I IT'S REALLY A GOOD IDEA I THINK IMPRACTICALITY HOWEVER I'M JUST FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES FROM BEAVER ARE WHO MENTIONED- YOU KNOW HOW MANY TRIBUTARIES AND RIVERS AND ALL THAT IT'S A KIND OF A MASSIVE UNDERTAKING AND SOME OF THE MORE ON NOT ENOUGH AREAS WHERE WE HAVE THOSE STREAMS AND LAKES ALONG THE BEACH AREAS I WAS VERY INVOLVED IN THE MONITORING CONFIRMED THERE WAS A LOT OF POLLUTION HERE IN SOUTH ORANGE COUNTY BEACHES AND IT TURNED OUT THAT IT WAS THE BIRDS THAT WERE. THE REAL PROBLEM SO I GO TO THE QUESTION OF A WIN THE SOURCES DISCOVERED AND WE KNOW THAT THERE'S A LOT OF POLLUTION GOING ON WITH THE ILLEGAL MARIJUANA GROWING UP IN THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR STATE I THINK IT'S EXTREMELY IMPORTANT THAT ON THIS BOARD THAT WILL BE BROUGHT TOGETHER- THAT WE DO HAVE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS I INVOLVED IN THOSE- AS MENTIONED BY MY COLLEAGUE THE- OF THE- TESTING THAT'S ALREADY GOING ON FOR YOU KNOW OTHER OTHER PURPOSES ALL OF THOSE PEOPLE NEED TO BE AT THE TABLE. AND I WOULD ALSO SUGGEST AND I'M GONNA SUPPORT IT TODAY BECAUSE I THINK IT'S A VERY IMPORTANT STEP BUT I THINK OF THE WORD MANNER IN WHICH IS PUT TOGETHER IS PROBABLY THE MOST IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF THIS BEING WORKABLE DATA SOURCE IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE ALL COSTS IS GOING TO BE AN ISSUE AND THOSE ARE ALREADY LAYERED- IN A NUMBER OF AREAS BUT WHEN YOU DETERMINE THE SOURCE IN THE PROGRAM OF HOW THAT'S GOING TO BE CONTROLLED I DO BELIEVE THE PLAN NEEDS TO BE BROUGHT BACK THE LEGISLATURE. AND I'D LIKE TO HAVE SOME COMMITMENT THAT THAT WOULD BE CONSIDERED BECAUSE THEY CAN COME UP WITH A PLAN THAT SOUNDS GREAT BUT WHEN IT'S IMPOSED ON LOCAL GOVERNMENTS THEY'RE ALREADY DOING SOME OF THESE THINGS AND THE MYRIAD OF SOURCE POTENTIAL FOR THE POLLUTION OF WHATEVER RADIOS CAN BE- HUGE HUGE ARE IT TOOK FOR THE BEACH AREAS I WAS ON THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS FOR EIGHT YEARS IT TOOK ALMOST. THAT ENTIRE TIME TO TESTING OUR TO DETERMINE THAT IT WAS. OF THE BIRD IN THE SIZE FOR THEM FOR OF THE CAMPUS- BEECHER. THAT WE REALLY SOURCE AND IT WASN'T JUST THE ODD. OUTFLOW FROM FERTILIZING LAWNS UP UP AND NOT HIGHLANDS OF. THE FACT MANY OF SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO AREA. AND THAT WAS VERY COSTLY BUT IT WAS VERY IMPORTANT BECAUSE DOWN THERE WERE- DEFICIT CAME FORWARD TO DISCOURAGE THE BIRDS FROM COLLECTING. IN CERTAIN AREAS. BUT ANYWAY THOSE ARE THINGS THAT ARE OF CONCERN AS WE PUT TOGETHER- A PROGRAM THAT'S REALLY GOING TO DO THE JOB THAT YOU HOPE AND THAT WE ALL WANT DONE- SO I WOULD SUGGEST THAT REALLY NEEDS COME BACK. HERE ONCE WE GOT SOMETHING TOGETHER AND IMPERATIVE. THAT WE HAVE OF THOSE WHO ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN ALL OF THAT. THAT THERE AT THE TABLE. I THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THOSE COMMENTS SENATOR OF THE BILL IN FACT TO ANTICIPATE SO- THAT THERE WOULD BE- IMPLEMENTATION- CUT LEGISLATION REQUIRED. BEFORE THE PROGRAM ACTUALLY MOVES FORWARD SO AFTER ALL THIS DATA IS. COLLECTED AND TO THE WORKING GROUP DOES ITS WORK REPORTS BACK TO THE WATER POURED. WATER BOARD- ESSENTIALLY MAKES RECOMMENDATIONS ALTHOUGH I DON'T THINK THAT'S THE WORD THAT'S USED- AND THEN THE LEGISLATURE WOULD HAVE TO ACT. WELL THANK YOU AND AGAIN THANK YOU FOR BRINGING UP FOR. YOU GREAT. I QUESTIONS- BILLS MOVED SENATOR. MCCASKEY HI ASSEMBLY GEORGE CLOSE. IT'S A- A- WELL KNOWN- ADVERTISING CUT LINE NOW- BECAUSE- TASK WHAT WHAT'S IN YOUR WALLET THIS BILL SEEKS TO ANSWER THE QUESTION WHAT'S IN YOUR WATER- THAT'S A VERY IMPORTANT QUESTION WE DON'T KNOW IF MANY CALIFORNIANS DON'T KNOW THE ANSWER TO THAT QUESTION THEY DESERVE TO KNOW AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU OKAY I'M CONSUMPTION OR- ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB TEN SIXTY SIX BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER BLOOM THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS ALAN HI ALAN I BATES AYE BATES I'D DALLY.

I AM HAPPY TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHICH ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERN AROUND THE DEFINITION OF INTENTIONALLY- POTENTIALLY ADDED EXCUSE ME- THIS THIS BILL AB TWELVE HUNDRED PROTECT CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS BY REDUCING HUMAN EXPOSURE TO AN ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION FROM P. FILES. THOUSANDS OF COMMITTEES VERY WELL WHERE IS ARE A CLASS OF OVER NINE THOUSAND FOREVER FOREVER CHEMICALS HAVE BEEN LINKED TO ISSUES. SUCH AS CANCER HORMONE DISRUPTION KIDNEY AND LIVER DAMAGE AND- MANY OTHER. DISEASES CURRENTLY P. FAST CAN BE DETECTED IN 98% OF AMERICANS- WHEN YOU LOOK AT THEIR BLOOD. WE'VE SEEN COMPANIES- TAKE ACTION. WHICH IS GREAT THESE THESE CHEMICALS CAN BE FOUND IN TAKE OUT CONTAINERS COOKWARE- AND THEY'RE THERE TO PROTECT THE- TRUMP CONTAINERS SO THAT THE FOOD. HAS A LEAK ONTO OUR CLOSER. OUT OF THEIR- CONTAINERS BUT WE'VE SEEN INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES LIKE MCDONALD'S WENDY'S CHIPOTLE WHOLE FOODS AND OTHER STATES LIKE NEW YORK. ALREADY TAKE ACTION TO PHASE OUT OR BAN P. FASTER FROM THEIR PAPER FOOD PACKAGING. A RECENT REPORT FOUND THAT 80% OF NONSTICK PANS IN 20% A BIG WHERE TESTING CONTAINING CODY MADE FROM P. FAST. SAID THIS BILL BANS THE USE OF INTENTIONALLY ADDED P. FAST. IN PLANT BASED FOOD PACKAGING BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE IT ALSO REQUIRES COOKWARE MANUFACTURERS TO DISCLOSE THE USE OF PEOPLE AFTER THE HAZARDOUS CHEMICALS FROM THE DTCS CARE TO CHEMICAL THIS. THE PRODUCTS ONLINE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE AND ON PACKAGING BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. AND PROHIBITS MISLEADING MARKETING CLAIMS ON COOKWARE CLAIMING TO BE FREE OF A SPECIFIC. HAZARDOUS CHEMICAL WHEN OTHER CYNICAL CHEMICALS ARE PRESENT ONLINE BY TWENTY TWENTY THREE IN ON PACKAGING BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR. WITH THAT WE'RE HAPPY TO HAVE TWO WITNESSES AND A READ FROM OUR DC AND- NANCY BORE MINOR. FROM THE BREAST CANCER PREVENTION PARTNERS. IF YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH. THE I GOOD MORNING CARE AND MY OF THE AND YOU FOR THAT TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY MY NAME IS TANNER AND I'M OF ENOUGH RESOURCES COUNCIL'S WE FIND OUR ENERGY SUPPORT AB TWELVE HUNDRED TO RESTRICT THE UNNECESSARY USE THAT OFTEN IT PACKAGING INDEPENDENT IS NOT VERY CLEAR BODIES INCLUDING CALIFORNIANS ON DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE FACT OF THE CLASS. ACTION BAR MENTAL AND PUBLIC HEALTH THREAT AND LAST YEAR THE LEGISLATURE PHASE OUT THE USE. OF ALL PEACOCK PARK READING FROM. A COUPLE EARLIER BY DR ANDREWS. TRANSACTION WE PUSH. CAN BUILD UP THE OUR BODIES AND OUR SAYS. WITH A WIDE ARRAY OF HARM HEALTH. INCLUDING CANCER SYSTEMS. AND ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTAL EFFECTS. BUT IT COVERED IN THE BY THE HIGH PREVALENCE BUT THE PACKAGING OF MOLDED FIBER AND OTHER PLANT BASED PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN PIZZA. PRODUCTS CAN EXPOSE CONSUMERS TO PEOPLE AS THEY EAT AN OFFICER CONTAMINATION OF WATER AND FOOD PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THEIR LIFECYCLE ESPECIALLY. DURING PRODUCTION AND THE WIFE. NUMBER ONE COMPO CONTAINER WITH PETOSKEY. PACKAGING FARMERS WHO USE THAT. IN THEIR FEEL CAN IN A- CONTAMINATE THEIR GRANDMA CROP AND LIVESTOCK. A GOOD MAN THE MULTIPLE COMPANIES BUT PEOPLE. THREE GOOD PACKAGING AND INDUSTRY IS GOING TO LEAD A MAJOR CHAINS LIKE CHIPOTLE MCDONALD'S AND WHOLE FOODS IN SMALLER CHAINS LIKE SWEETGREEN OF ARGUMENT COMMITMENTS AND THE USE THAT PEOPLE OFTEN LIKE THE PACKAGING. AND FURTHER LOCAL JURISDICTIONS SUCH AS SAN FRANCISCO AND BERKELEY HAVE ALREADY FACE OUT THE USE OF PEACOCK CONTAINING THE PACKAGING. AND PERHAPS MOST RELEVANT TO THIS BILL NEW YORK STATE RECENTLY PAN PEACOCK BASS PACKAGING STARTING IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY TWO. DUE TO THE EXTREME PERSISTENCE OF THESE CHEMICALS IS NOW GONNA CONSEQUENCES. FOR DECADES TO COME GIVEN THE- OF ALL. IT'S TIME TO THINK ABOUT ON THE USE OF PIZZA IN THE KEY PRODUCT HOW. CAN I DO YOU SEE ALSO COULD THE- TO CORPS OF THE BILL WHICH MY COLLEAGUE IN THE PRESS CANCER. PART PREVENTION PARTNERS WILL DISCUSS THANK. OKAY WHAT'S NOW HERE FROM. IN READ.

MY NAME IS NANCY MEYER I WORK FOR BREAST FROM PARTNERS. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE BILL'S CO SPONSORS THE CPP CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH. CLEAN WATER ACTION ENVIRONMENTAL WORKING GROUP AND NRDC. YOU JUST HEARD FROM AL Y. P. FAST TO PACKAGING OUR OUR IS SO CONCERNING AND HOW AB TWELVE HUNDRED ADDRESSES THIS ISSUE SO I WILL FOCUS ON THE COOKWARE PORTION OF THE BILL. RECENT TESTING FOUND PFAS CHEMICALS SUCH AS PTSD OFTEN KNOWN BY THE BRAND NAME TEFLON. IN THE HORMONE DISRUPTING CHEMICAL DISNEYLAND OR BPA IN THE COATINGS OF COOK AND BAKEWARE. WE KNOW P. FAST CAN BE RELEASED INTO THE AIR WHEN HANDS REACH HIGH TEMPERATURES EXPOSING BOTH PEOPLE AND PETS. HOWEVER NO DISCLOSURE OF CHEMICALS IN THESE PRODUCTS IS REQUIRED AT THE FEDERAL OR STATE LEVEL. ADDITIONALLY COOKWARE PACKAGING OFTEN CLAIMS A PRODUCT IS FREE OF A SPECIFIC P. FILES SUCH AS PFOA OR PFOS. EVEN CONSUMERS THE FALSE IMPRESSION THE PRODUCT IS FREE OF ALL SIMILAR TOXIC CHEMICALS IN FACT HAND LABELED P. FOR FREE ARE OFTEN MADE WITH ANOTHER FORM OF P. FAST. CONSUMERS HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW TOXIC CHEMICALS ARE IN COOKWARE AND MANUFACTURE SHOULD NOT BE ALLOWED TO USE MARKETING CLAIMS TO MISLEAD CONSUMERS. AB TWELVE HUNDRED ADDRESSES BOTH OF THESE CONCERNS SHOULD BE OFFERING BECAUSE DOCTORS HAVE WORKED EXTENSIVELY WITH THE COMMITTEE AND OPPOSITION TO ADDRESS OPPOSITION CONCERNED IF YOU COULD WIND UP YOUR COMMENTS OR WERE YOU RUNNING UP AGAINST THEM. AT THE TIME. OKAY I'LL JUST SAY IN THE CURRENT FORM IT PROTECTS PUBLIC HEALTH WITHOUT UNDULY. BURDENING INDUSTRY AND WE ASK FOR YOUR EYES. THANK YOU WE- BOTH BOTH OF THE OF SUPPORT WHEN HIS TIME IS.

IN ADDITION TO THE DEFINITION AND PASHLEY ADDED INTO A MEMBER COMPANIES OF ALL THE RATE IF YOU INTENTIONALLY ISSUES RELATED TO IMPLEMENTATION TRANSFERRED THE GIRLS WORKABLE AND FOCUSED ON THE CONCERN AT HAND. FIRST WE WOULD NOTE THAT THE INTENT DEFINITION OF COOKWARE IN THE BILL LACKS CLARITY OF SCOPE. MORE SPECIFICALLY THE INCLUSION OF A GRADE COOKWARE INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED YOU. MAY CREATE REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY FOR MANUFACTURERS AND I THINK WHETHER THEIR. PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT USE REQUIREMENT. MEMBERS BUT- FOR THE CLEAR AND THAT YOU'RE- SO THAT THE MANUFACTURER COMMUNITY HAVE THE UNDERSTANDING OF THE- BOB. YOU'RE JUST REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONAL WE AGREE THEM OF CHECKING FARTHER THE MATH SEVEN. DISCLOSURE THAT SAID WE WERE REASONABLE. OF THE BILL CARDS WHAT WE'RE- COOKWARE. CAME ON PRADA DISCLOSURE ONLINE DISCLOSURE AND A Q. R. CODE OR SOME FORM OF SCANNABLE CODE. IN GADSDEN G. RESPECTFULLY REQUEST FLEXIBILITY REGARDING THE METHOD USED TO CONVEY INGREDIENT INFORMATION. WHETHER THAT BE ON THE LABEL VIA MANUFACTURER WEBSITE OR Q. R. CODE OR SOME SCANNABLE CODE. SO AS NOT TO BE UNNECESSARILY DUPLICATIVE AVOID INCREASED PACKAGING AND LABELING WASTE AND TO ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE SPACE FOR THE REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

GENERALLY STATE WE'VE WE HAVE THE DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE WHICH WE WORKED ON IT MEANS IS THAT- I CAL SKIN I SAID ON. SUB TWO AND WE'RE FINDING THEM AND WE'RE GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY TO. MOVE THROUGH THESE PROCESSES WHERE WE HAVE- YOU KNOW SCIENCE AND DATA AND THINGS THAT WE CAN TRY TO GET TO A PLACE WHERE. THE MANUFACTURERS KNOW WHAT THE RULES ARE AND SO TODAY WE'VE SEEN TWO BILLS NOW- COMING THROUGH WITH. YOU KNOW SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS ARE NEARING IN ON. ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS AND SO I'M A LITTLE AREAS OF THE FACT THAT IN AND WE'VE HEARD FROM THE OPPOSITION THAT. THE OPPORTUNITY TO. BE HELD HARMLESS I THINK IS SOMETHING THAT THEY THEY NEED TO BE ABLE TO NOT BE ABLE TO GO SU IF WERE. CHANGING THAT WERE FOR SPEEDING UP THE PROCESS QUITE FRANKLY SO I'M AND I KNOW THAT BOTH AUTHORS THAT CAME IN HAVE BEEN WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO TRY TO GET. TO A PLACE WHERE EVERYBODY IS WORKABLE SO I JUST WANT TO SHARE THAT I THINK THAT WE DO. A AND FOR THE FOR THE TIME I'VE SAT ON THIS COMMITTEE IN THIS HOUSE IN THE TIME I SAT ON THE COMMITTEE IN THE OTHER HOUSE E. Q. WE'VE BEEN. VERY CRITICAL OF DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCES AND HOW. AND GREEN CHEMISTRY ON HOW WE GET. FROM WHERE WERE ARE TO WHERE WE WERE. WANT TO GO. TO WANT TO SURE THAT WE'RE- AS SENIOR LOT OF BILLS THROUGH SO I. COMMTTEE THE AUTHOR I MEAN OF. LAY OFF YOUR BILL UNTIL I SEE WHAT THE MIMICS REAL ARE BUT I DON'T ONCE WE ENCOURAGE- THE COMMITTEE. MAKE SURE THAT THE PEOPLE THAT ARE TRYING TO. GET TO A PLACE WHERE THEIR MANUFACTURING IN MAKING IT SAFE FOR THE PUBLIC THAT THEY HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO GET CAUGHT IN A CATCH TWENTY TWO BECAUSE WE'RE MOVING A LITTLE BIT. FOR TRYING TO PUSHED. DEPARTMENT TALK TO SUBJECTS. SUBSTANCE INTO. IT TO GET THESE DONE SO I JUST CAUTION AND WE'VE- WE'VE DIPPED. IN THIS BUDGET. HAS BEEN PROPOSED A LOT OF RESOURCES TO HELP. DEPARTMENT TOXIC SUBSTANCE GET WHERE THEY NEED TO BE IN SO I THINK WE'RE PUSHING THEM. WITHOUT GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITY. WITH THE RESOURCES AVAILABLE. TO GET WHERE WE WANT TO GO SO JUST A COMMENT I KNOW THAT THE- THE BOTH AUTHORS APPEAR LOOK NOBODY WANTS THESE. THIS STUFF IN THEIR PRODUCTS AND YOU'VE HEARD FROM THE MANUFACTURER SO JUST- ENCOURAGEMENT TO BE ABLE TO GETS TO. HAVE A- PLACE WHERE THE- OPPOSITION IS COMFORTABLE AS WELL AND ARE NOT. HELD TO SOME. THE STANDARD THAT ALLOWS THEM TO BE SUED AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT I AM SOME OF OUR- AT LEAST ON THE REPUBLICAN SIDE HERE. COMMENTS HAVE BEEN YOU KNOW THE LIABILITY PART OF IT IS A BIG DEAL. AND WE STILL NEED THESE WE STILL NEED THESE PRODUCTS BILL TO PACKAGE OUR FOOD AND GET IT WE'RE GOING TO ESPECIALLY. WITH TAKE OUT IN THE THINGS WE'VE SEEN DURING THE PANDEMIC SO JUST SOME THOUGHTS THANK YOU. SARCASTIC IS THE AUTHOR KNOWS I'VE BEEN A DEFENDER GREEN CHEMISTRY IN VERY LEERY OF ONE OFFS I THINK WHAT IS DIFFERENT IN THIS SITUATION AND I AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM BEAVER IS THAT FOOD DGSE HAS ALREADY IDENTIFIED AS TO PRIORITY- PRODUCTS WITH ED HAPPY FAST WITH CARPETS AND A PLANT BASED FOOD SO WE'RE TAKING A SEPARATE SEIZE THE LEGISLATURE'S WE'VE GOT THAT BOOK SLOW MOVING THE MINUTE LEAVE CRITICAL SLOW MOVING- TRAIN THAT IS IDENTIFIED PLANT FACE COVERING SO BY EXTENDING IT TO. ALL FOOD PACKAGING IT'S IN THIS IT I THINK IT'S HARMONIZING RIGHT AND OBVIOUSLY TO MOVE TO COOK WHERE HE HAD TO BE AND THE CHAPLAIN PAN BEFORE YOU GOT INTO THE IF THE FOOD PACKAGING SO IT'S NOT IN THE IN THE RICH ASSEMBLY AND SENATE TRADITION OF ONE OFF CHEMICAL BANDS TO COME OUT OF NOWHERE THAT ARE ARE ADVOCATES GIVE IS TO SELL AT WITH THAT SAID AND- VARYING NARROWLY. TAILORED I WOULD MOVE THE BILL. THANK YOU. THE HAS BEEN MOVED WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE FIFTIES VERY QUICKLY IN THE SENATE SENATOR DOLLY AND I ARE FROM THE SAME CLASS WEEKLY CAME INTO OFFICE IN TWENTY TWELVE WEEKS SAT ON THE STM TOGETHER FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS AND WE CONSTANTLY HEARD OF THE INDUSTRY TALKING ABOUT WAIT FOR THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROCESS WAIT FOR THE GREEN CHEMISTRY PROCESS I THINK CENTER CAL SKI. COMMENTED AS TO HOW THEY'VE IDENTIFIED- THESE PRODUCTS ALREADY- HOWEVER WERE LONGER FRESHMEN OR IN OUR SECOND TERM FOR OUR THIRD TERM THIS HAS BEEN WE WE'VE BEEN IN OFFICE NOW FOR NINE YEARS ON AND THE PROCESS HAS MOVED TOO SLOWLY TO THE POINT WHERE AGAIN. INDUSTRY IS ALREADY MOVING AHEAD OF THIS PROCESS YOU HAVE MAKE DONALD YOU HAVE. THE TRIPLE A YOU HAVE WHOLE FOODS YOU HAVE WENDY'S THESE ARE NOT SMALL COMPANY WITH ALL OF THE LOAN MOVES THE MARKET AS WE ALL KNOW. IT SO IF THEY'RE SAYING THIS IS SOMETHING A PRODUCT OR WE DON'T FEEL COMFORTABLE GIVING TO OUR CONSUMERS I THINK IT'S CALIFORNIANS WE HAVE TO TAKE A VERY LEERY- LOOK AT THESE CHEMICALS AND POTENTIALLY THE DATA THAT THE DATA IS THE DATA IS THERE. THE SCIENCE IS THERE I THINK IT WAS TIME FOR US TO ACT SO WITHOUT REALLY APPRECIATE THE MOTION AND DO ASK FOR YOUR ABOUT. TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR A BI TWELVE HUNDRED THANK YOU.

NEIL EDGAR COVERED MOST OF THE DETAILS SO I WILL BE BRIEF IN MY COMMENTS. THIS ACTUALLY FAIRLY SIMPLE BILL THAT ENSURES THAT CONSUMERS GET WHAT THEY PAY FOR WHEN THEY BUY A PRODUCT THAT'S LABELED COMPOSTABLE. MYERS AT THE PRODUCT IS THIRD PARTY CERTIFIED ACTUALLY BREAK DOWN IN CALIFORNIA COMPOSTING FACILITIES- IT'S REQUIRED NOT CONTAMINATE COMPOST OR THE STATE AGRICULTURAL SYSTEM WITH TOXIC CHEMICALS LIKE PEACOCKS. AND IT IS READILY IDENTIFIABLE TO BOTH CONSUMERS AND SOLID WASTE FACILITIES AND DESTRUCTIVE LOOKALIKE PRODUCTS AREN'T ALLOWED TO GREENWASHING THEIR PRODUCTS AND COMPETE WITH GENUINELY COMPOSTABLE ALTERNATIVES- IN ADDITION TO WHAT NIELSEN I WANT TO HIGHLIGHT THE OVERLAP BETWEEN THIS BILL AND TWO OTHER BILLS THAT HAVE COME BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE. THIS YEAR- THE FIRST WITH THE CHAIRS SB THREE FORTY THREE THAT ENACTED PARALLEL LIMITS ON THE ITEMS LABELED RECYCLABLE. AND THE SECOND IS A FAMILY MEMBER GONZALEZ IS AB EIGHT EIGHT ONE OF THE COMMITTEE BACK I'M SO SORRY WE HAVE TO ASK YOU TO FINISH UP. OKAY MY ABOUT FINAL STATEMENT SORRY- IS THAT TOGETHER THESE THREE BILLS SHOULD RESTORE CONSUMERS SAY THAN THE RECYCLING SYSTEM BY ENSURING THAT THINGS LABELED RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE ARE TRULY RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ACTUALLY GET RECYCLED OR COMPOSTED IF THE CONSUMER DOES THEIR JOB B PUTTING HIM IN THE RIGHT AND ZACHARY. YEP OKAY THANK YOU- LET'S GO TO THE PHONE LINES EVEN WANTS TO WAIT IN SUPPORT.

CAPTAIN ADVOCATES ON BEHALF CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION CURRENTLY WITH AN OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED POSITION ON IT A LITTLE TROUBLE ONE. WE DO APPRECIATE HOWEVER THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS WILLINGNESS TO CONTINUE THE DIALOGUE ON THE BILL LAST YEAR REVISED GREATER CLARITY ODD AND YOU ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS ARE THAT GMG MEMBER COMPANIES HAVE IDENTIFIED FIVE. OUT OF THE GATE TO BE CLEAR SKIN J. AND MEMBER COMPANIES DO SUPPORT ESTABLISHING CLEAR STANDARDS FOR GREEN CLAIMS SUCH AS COMPOSTABLE TO ENSURE CLARITY FOR CONSUMERS AND TO CREATE A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD FOR MANUFACTURERS THAT WISH TO INVEST IN COMBUSTIBLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING THAT SAID WE ARE CONCERNED THAT AB TROUBLE ONE OF CURRENTLY DROPPED DEAD WOULD PROHIBIT LEGITIMATE COMPOSABLE CLEAN ON A VARIETY OF PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING. THEREBY CREATING A DISINCENTIVE FOR MANUFACTURERS AND COMBUSTIBLE MATERIALS ARE FUNDAMENTAL CONCERN WITH AB TROUBLE ONE OF CURRENTLY DROPPED IS THAT IT WOULD REQUIRE A PRODUCT LABELED AS COMPOSED OF ALL TO BE AN ALLOWABLE ORGANIC AND PLANT I'M THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE NATIONAL ORGANIC PROGRAM. AND THE DEPARTMENT OF FOOD AND AGRICULTURE'S ORGANIC AND NATURAL PROGRAM UNFORTUNATELY HOWEVER THE NOPD AND ORGANIC MATERIAL PROGRAMMER. OKAY JOHN. PRODUCT PACKAGING APPROACH COULD FOR ORGANIC I. PRODUCTS TO FIVE AND CROP. IN THIS REGARD ANY. OR PACKAGE THAT CAN BE LABELED AS OF TODAY. BUT THAT MADE BY YOU PATTERSON FOR AND GOT CON FOR OTHER USE. WITH NO BE ABLE TO DELAY COMPOSTABLE THAT WOULD NOT BE DEEMED ACROSS FOR THE NEAR SCOPE THE BILL OF ORGANIC ON. SPONSOR OF AB TWELVE AWAY. SEVEN AT THE INDIAN NUMBER COMPANIES THE BIGGEST MARKET GOING DRUG. OUT I DID ORGANIC AGRO. AND INTEREST. ACTUALLY DROPPED A WITH YOUR MARKETING.

IN FACT ON INNOVATION FOR COMPANIES SEEKING TO USE MORE SUSTAINABLE PRODUCTS AND PACKAGING AMID A LARGER PUSH RELATED TO THE CIRCULAR ECONOMY AND THE STATE'S WASTE REDUCTION GOAL. ORDINIS CM JANET MEMBER COMPANIES BELIEVE THAT THE AUTHOR AND SPONSORS UNDERLYING TENTH MAY BE ACHIEVED BY NARROWING THE SCOPE OF THE BILL THE PRODUCTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO FALL WITHIN THE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF NOPD MAINLY ORGANICALLY PRODUCED AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTS. FOOD FIGHT FRENCH TO CROP. FINALLY THINKING OF MEMBER COMPANIES ARE ALSO CONSTRUED THE NEW LABELING REQUIREMENTS UNDER EACH OTHER ONE WHAT WE SUPPORT CLEAR COMMUNICATION OF CLAIMS. TO CONSUMERS THAT COMPOSTABLE CROP. I'M THE OKAY.

FAST CONTAMINATED- BURKE LIKE LIKE FOOD YOU KNOW- FAST FOOD WRAPPINGS OR- ANY KIND OF FIVE BAGS OR EVEN RECEIPTS I I'VE TALKED ABOUT PAPER RECEIPTS THE PAST. THE CONTAMINATES THE COMPOST DREAM UNNECESSARILY WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT FOR PROJECT IS ACTUALLY COMPOSTABLE DOESN'T CONTAIN P. FAST- WHICH I THINK WILL CAP THE MAKE THE COMPOST THE MOST VALUABLE.

NOTHING AND THAT THAT THE WE'RE NOT GONNA HARM INDUSTRIAL COMPOSTING AS PART OF THIS PROCESS WHICH ROUGHLY RIGHT THERE AND YOU'RE GETTING IT AT A REAL ISSUE HERE WHICH IS THAT FOR THE VAST MAJORITY OF PEOPLE- THE ITEMS THAT THEY BY THINKING THAT THEIR COMBUSTIBLE ARE ACTUALLY NOT COMBUSTIBLE AND SO WE'RE GETTING SOME TRUTH IN ADVERTISING HERE. SO FOLKS ARE ARE BETTER INFORMED- WITH THAT THE MOVE I SENATORS ALWAYS CONSULT PLEASE COLOR. I NUMBER SO. A. TWELVE A ONE BY ASSEMBLY MEMBER TANG THE MOTION IS TO PASS BUT FIRST BE REFERRED TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. ALLEN HI ALLEN AYE BATES.

MEMBERS MAY PERCEIVE AND READY TO CELEBRATE WITH BY THE WAY I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT WE HAVE- HAS SOME LATE AMENDMENTS THAT WE'VE WORKED OUT- THE WITH THE AUTHOR- IT'S RESOLVED AT LEAST SOME OF THE SIGNIFICANT OPPOSITION CONCERNS AND I THINK EVERYBODY'S BEEN PROVIDED WITH A COPY IF YOU DON'T HAVE A COPY THOSE MOMENTS PLEASE LET LET US KNOW WE'LL GET YOU COPY. 30% CARE IN MEMBERS FOR ALLOWING TO PRESENT AB SEVEN NINETY FOUR AND A HALF ASSEMBLY WOMAN CREE- AS YOU STATED I BELIEVE- STRIKING THE INTENT LANGUAGE HAS HELPED REMOVE AGAIN. THE OPPOSITION HOPEFULLY FINALLY THIS TIME AND NOT ASKING FOR STRIKING MORE THINGS. IN THE BILL. MOVE THE BILL AB. THANK YOU. I'D LIKE TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE MEMANTINE THANK ME STAFF ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR FOR THE WORK ON THESE. AB SEVEN NINETY FOUR WOULD REQUIRE PUBLIC SUBSIDIES FOR CLEAN DREDGING SHORT HAUL TRUCKS TO BE TIED COMPLIANCE WITH LABOR STANDARDS. AS IMPORTANT AS IT IS FOR STATE TO TRANSITION TO A GREEN ECONOMY IT'S EQUALLY IMPORTANT MAKE SURE WE PROTECT AND SUPPORT CALIFORNIA WORKERS.ABILITY TO STATE TO MEET AMBITIOUS CLIMATE GOALS DEPENDS IN LARGE PART ON FLEET PURCHASERS TRANSITIONING TO ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES. AS WE WORK TO COMBAT. GREEN GET GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS FROM THE TRANSPORTATION SECTOR IT'S IMPORTANT REALIZE THERE'S A HISTORY OF LABOR LAW VIOLATIONS IN THE COMMERCIAL TRUCKING INDUSTRY. CAN IN THE DROEGE INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR TRACKING COMPANIES INTENTIONALLY AND ILLEGALLY MISCLASSIFIED DRIVERS AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS TO SHIFT THE COST OF DOING BUSINESS. AS MENTIONED ANALYSIS BETWEEN 75285% PORT TRUCK DRIVERS LIKELY MEET THE CORPUS CLASSIFICATION CRITERIA. DRIVER'S CANNOT AFFORD THE NEW CLEAN ZERO EMISSION TRUCKS WITH THE COST TO PURCHASE MAINTAIN VEHICLES FALLS ON THEM RATHER THAN THE COMPANIES. AB SEVEN NAME FOR WILL ENSURE THE PUBLIC FUNDS ADMINISTERED BY CARD FOR THE PURCHASE OF ZERO EMISSION PORT DRAYAGE AND SHORT HAUL TRUCKS ARE TIED TO REQUIREMENTS OF THE FLEET PURCHASERS. NOT VIOLATE STATE LAWS REGARDING MISS CLASSIFICATION WORKERS IN A BANK CONTRACTORS. I ADD. I HOPE THAT THIS IS THE- IT WHAT WITH A NUMBER OF OTHER BILLS COMING THROUGH THAT THIS IS A REAL- EFFORT TO LOOK FOR A JUST TRANSITION AS WE'RE ALWAYS TALKING ABOUT. HOW DO WE- INCORPORATE THE NEEDS THAT WE HAVE TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE ALONG WITH THE NEEDS TO ENSURE THAT WORKERS ARE MADE WHOLE. AND CONTINUE TO BE ABLE TO PROSPER IN INDUSTRIES THAT ARE PRIMARILY BLUE COLLAR IN THE STATE I RESPECTFULLY ON BEHALF OF THE AUTHOR ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE BEFORE THAT IN- FOR TESTIMONY OF THEIR FLOCKS TO REPRESENT TEAMSTERS PORT DIVISION. AND SAM APPEL THE CALIFORNIA POLICY MANAGER THE GREEN. THE BLUE GREEN ALLIANCE. SURGERIES ARE YOU SIR. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS THEIR FLOCKS- THE TEAMSTERS PORT DIVISION WHERE A CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL AND WE'RE VERY PROUD TO BE PART OF THIS COALITION IS A COALITION OF LABOR COMMUNITY. AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND WE'VE BEEN BROUGHT TOGETHER BY THE BELIEF THAT WE CAN CREATE AND WE NEED TO CREATE GOOD WELL PAYING JOBS. IN ORDER TO MEET OUR CLIMATE GOALS THAT CLIMATE JUSTICE IS TIED TO ECONOMIC AND TO RACIAL JUSTICE. LOW INCOME COMMUNITIES OF COLOR ARE THE HARDEST HIT BY CLIMATE CHANGE AND THEY SUFFER A DIST DISPROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE IMPACTS. NO WHERE IS THAT MORE CLEAR THAN AT THE PORTS AND IN TRANSPORTATION. YOU SEE SHORT HAUL AND DRAYAGE TRUCKS THE HEAVIEST EMITTERS THESE ARE HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS THEY'RE MOVING GOODS FROM THE PORTS THEY PUT THEM ON LONG HAUL TRUCKS THOSE TRACKS GO ACROSS ALL THE FREEWAYS. THEY GO TO WAREHOUSES THERE IDOLING THERE A MEETING MORE AND MORE TOXINS AND ALL THE WHILE THESE ARE pIMPORTS THEY'RE ALL UNDER THE FREEWAYS AROUND WAREHOUSES WORKERS AND COMMUNITIES ARE SUFFERING. AND TRUCK DRIVERS AT THE PORTS ARE ALSO SUFFERING FROM MISS CLASSIFICATION. THEY ARE JUST NOT MAKING THE WAGES THAT THEY NEED TO BE ABLETO BE PART OF THE TRANSITION. YOU CAN SEE FROM THE AT THE ANALYSIS WHICH WAS AN EXCELLENT ANALYSIS- THAT- MISCLASSIFIED OR INDEPENDENT CONTRACTED TRUCK DRIVERS MAKE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN THOSE THAT ARE DIRECTLY EMPLOYED. AND SO AT THE SAME TIME THEY HAVE HIGHER CAPITAL EXPENSES TO DO UPKEEP AND BUY FUEL FOR THEIR TRUCKS. AND SO MISCLASSIFIED TRUCK DRIVERS ARE THE LEAST ABLE TO AFFORD THE TRANSITION TO A CLEAN VEHICLES AND YET THE STATE EXPECTS THEM TO. THEY'RE THE ONES THAT HAVE TO BEAR THE BURDEN OF THE TRANSITION SO WHAT AB SEVEN NINETY FOUR SIMPLY DOES IS IT SAYS. THAT IN ORDER TO BE ABLE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR A CLEAN VEHICLE SUBSIDY THROUGH CARB. A TRUCKING COMPANY OR AN INDEPENDENT TRUCKER HAS TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEY ARE IN COMPLETE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE ANY VIOLATIONS RELATING TO- LAWS THAT ARE DEAL WITH MISS CLASSIFICATION. AND WE TOOK AMENDMENTS IN THE ASSEMBLY TO BE VERY CLEAR THAT THIS MEANS A FINAL UNSATISFIED JUDGMENT PASSED THE POINT OF APPEAL- THAT THIS ISN'T GOING TO BE SOMETHING FRIVOLOUS THAT WE REALLY WANT. TO CREATE AN INCENTIVE TO HAVE COMPANIES TRANSITION TO AN EMPLOYMENT MODEL TO BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW AND AT THE SAME TIME BE IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR CLIMATE GOALS. SO WE THINK THAT SB SEVEN NINETY FOUR IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP WE DO NEED TO DO MORE TO CREATE GOOD JOBS IN THE CLIMATIC ECONOMY INCLUDING IN MANUFACTURING- BUT WE WANTED TO START WITH THIS VERY TARGETED- BILL IN ONE OF THAT THE HIGHEST PRODUCING INDUSTRIES AND SO WE URGE AYE. THANK YOU AND I'M ALSO HERE TO ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS. DECIRME ARE PROTECTED FROM SAM FELL FROM BLUEGREEN ALLIANCE ON THE FUNDS. AND THEN I WILL SAY SAM AND SARAH VERY ELOQUENTLY TOOK UP ALMOST ALL THE TIME SO PLEASE KEEP A VERY BRIEF. YEAH SHE DID A GREAT JOB. HE WAS% GREAT THOUGH- GOOD MORNING CHAIR ALLEN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MANY OF THEM WELL IN THE STATE MANAGER FOR BLUE GREEN ALLIANCE- WE'RE ALIGNED WITH TEN LABOR UNIONS AND FIVE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS.

IT'S VERSION BUT THE BILL INCLUDED A ROBOT MANUFACTURING ARCHITECTURE- AND DUE TO INDUSTRY OPPOSITION THOSE PROVISIONS WERE REMOVED IN THE ASSEMBLY CONNOR WAITED THE SENATE WE RETAINED INTENT LANGUAGE WHICH IS THIRD IN CALIFORNIA'S INTENTIONS AT THE CORE U. S. IN CALIFORNIA. VEHICLE MANUFACTURING AND HIGHER JOBS FOR DISADVANTAGED WORKERS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY HAS CONTINUED TO OPPOSE THE CONTENT WITH THE COALITION OF DECIDED TO REMOVE THAT LANGUAGE TO PROTECT ESSENTIAL TRACKING ELEMENT THE BILL. WE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK FEDERAL DISCUSSIONS AROUND THE AUTO INDUSTRY- HOWEVER RIGHT NOW THE EVEN CHINA ARE TAKING THE LEAD IN GLOBAL YOU GAME BATTERY PRODUCTION. MAJOR AUTOMAKERS ARE OFFSHORING AUTO PRODUCTION LINES INTO JOBS TO LOW WAGE REGIONS OF THE WORLD. JEFF THAT MIDDLE CLASS JOB MENTION AUTO PRODUCTION AND OIL AND GAS BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR.

YEAH I JUST WANNA SAY THANK YOU TO THE AUTHOR AND THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER GONZALEZ FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD INTO SARAH AND THE AND THE AND THE WHOLE CREW FOR- BEING THE COALITION THIS IS IN MY BACKYARD AND SO. FOR ME IT'S ESPECIALLY- IMPORTANT THAT WE'RE ALIGNING BOTH LABOR STANDARDS- AND- OF COURSE ADVANCING ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY OF FOR THE RESIDENTS THAT LIVE NEARBY WHICH MANY OF OUR TRUCK DRIVERS. I JUST WANT TO SEE- YOU KNOW FAIR STANDARDS FOR THEMSELVES WHILE ALSO ENSURING THAT MORE REDUCING GHGS AND CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS SO. WITHOUT IT- LOVE TO MOVE THE BILL INAPPROPRIATE AND- I WOULD LOVE TO CONTINUE TO HEAR MORE ABOUT THE DISCUSSION AS IT MOVES FORWARD THANK YOU. THANK YOU CENTER- BATES. THANK YOU I WAS SUPPOSED TO OPPOSE THE BILL BUT IT SOUNDS TO ME LIKE WE'VE GOTTEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP COMING TOGETHER THAT PROJECTS KIND OF BOTH SIDES THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND ALL. OF THE WORK FORCE I WILL A LAYOFF TODAY AND HOPES THAT WE'LL SEE THOSE AMENDMENTS WHEN IT COMES TO THE NEXT COMMITTEE OR TO THE FLOOR. BUT THANK YOU TO ASSEMBLY MEMBER CARILLO AND THAT'S CERTAINLY THE CO AUTHORS FOR A HAVING THAT VERY STRONG ENGAGEMENT ON THE ISSUES THAT WERE IMPORTANT. TO YOU KNOW BOTH SIDES THANK YOU. THIRTY SEVEN DOLLARS. THE RESEARCHER I HAVE A QUESTION SO IF YOU'RE AN INDEPENDENT- THE OWNER OPERATOR AND YOU WANTED TO ACCESS THE GINGER OF FUNDS I BELIEVE THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THIS PROGRAM WOULD YOU BE REQUIRED TO BE IN A- THE LABOR AGREEMENT. NO I MEAN I WON'T SPEAK FOR BUT IT MAY JUST HAVE TO BE A PROPERLY CLASSIFIED INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SO THEY ACTUALLY HAVE TO. YEAH THE- ON THROUGH THE CHAIRED BY MAY- THROUGH THE DEFINITION IS- ON PAGE SEVEN ACTUALLY IT'S APPLICABLE LAW VIOLATION- AND WE WORKED WITH THE TRUCKING ASSOCIATION. OAKLEY ANYONE WHO IS APPLYING FOR A CARPSUBSIDY JUST HAS TO SHOW THAT THEY DON'T HAVE AN APPLICABLES LAW VIOLATION AND THAT IS VERY CLEARLY WRITTEN THAT IT IS AND I'M SATISFIED UNABATED VIOLATION OF THE LAWS RELATING TO MISS CLASSIFICATION. PASS THE TIME OF APPEAL SO WE TRIED TO MAKE IT VERY CLEAR AND SO ANYONE WHO DOESN'T HAVE THAT- WOULD BE ELIGIBLE SO AN INDEPENDENT OWNER OPERATOR EVEN IF THEY HAD ALLEGE MISS CLASSIFICATION AGAIN SOME WOULDN'T BE THE ONE WITH THE JUDGMENT AGAINST THEM IT WOULD BE- THE COMPANY. SAID THERE WOULD BE NOTHING PREVENTING THEM IF THEY WERE TRULY THERE. WELL OBVIOUSLY YOU KNOW IF THEY WERE IF. THE FUNDING TO GET IT. RIGHT WILL. I DON'T KNOW THE PROVISIONS OF WHATEVER THAT WAS A THREE EIGHTY EIGHT SEVENTY SAID THREE. I'LL HAVE TO LOOK AT THAT BUT- MY CONCERN IS THAT. SOME USE IN THE CHINESE WE HAVE ALIGNMENT NOW WITH BASICALLY PERSONAL G. DRIVE FUNDS COME FROM EVERYBODY IN THE STATE AND EVERYBODY SHOULD BE ABLE TO APPLY FOR THOSE FUNDS WHETHER YOU'RE- PART OF A BARGAINING UNIT OR NOT OR YOU'RE PART OF A COMPANY THAT'S UNION OR NON UNION. AND SO YOU KNOW THERE'S A LOT OF FOLKS WHO WE'VE SEEN WITH THE INFINITE CONTRACTING IN AB FIVE IN ALL THESE RULES THAT COME THROUGH HERE- BUT SOME PEOPLE CHOOSE TO DO THAT I JUST WANT THEM TO BE DISADVANTAGED BY THE FACT THAT. IF THEY'RE NOT PART OF- A COALITION OR A COMPANY THAT. IS APPLYING FOR THOSE GRANTS THAT THEY STILL HAVE THE ABILITY TO APPLY FOR THE GRANTS AND MEET THE CRITERIA. AND WE KNOW THAT THE TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE. BASICALLY FORCING UPON THEM. AREN'T EVEN REALLY AVAILABLE YET IN LEAST IN THE- FULLY HUNDRED PERCENT- NON ZERO EMISSION VEHICLES ON THE LEAST I TO MY KNOWLEDGE I'VE BEEN LOOKING I'M IN THE TRUCKING BUSINESS AND I HAVE NOT SEEN ANY THAT ARE AVAILABLE YET THAT MEET THAT CRITERIA AND I KNOW THIS IS SPECIFIC TO. THE PORTS AND DRIED STRUCK SO- I'M NOT GONNA SUPPORTING THE BILL TODAY I WANT I WANT WHAT WHAT WAS IT SB THREE EIGHTY EIGHT THAT IS IT IT'S IN THIS BILL AS WELL- I'M IN. IT BASIC IF YOU ARE A LEGITIMATE OPERATOR AND HAVE NO VIOLATIONS OF THE LAW YOU'RE ELIGIBLE. YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE UNION MMHM YEAH. AND I JUST I JUST AS A POINT OF CLARIFICATION THE MISS CLASSIFICATION OF POOR DRIVERS PRE SEEDS AB FIVE BY A LOT THEY WERE THOUSAND- CASES THAT THE LATE AT THOUSAND CASES FROM THE DRIVERS THEMSELVES FILED IN THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE BEFORE- DYNAMICS OR AB FIVE SO THIS IS NOT. THAT YOU KNOW AB FIVE MAKES IT MORE CLEAR FOR A LOT OF THINGS BUT WE'VE BEEN DEALING WITH THIS MASK MIS CLASSIFICATION FOR DECADES. WHAT WOULD YOU SAY MISS FOR CLASSIFICATION GIVE ME EXAMPLE OF WHAT THAT MEANS IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO DOESN'T HAVE A CLASS ONE LICENSE OR IS THAT SOMEBODY WHO. ISN'T MISS CLASSIFICATION AS FAR AS THEIR STATUS UNDER THE LABOR CODE THEY'RE THEY'RE TREATED AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. OWNER OPERATOR SOMETIMES AND THE PORT INDUSTRY IT'S BEEN FOUND OVER AND OVER AGAIN THEY ACTUALLY ARE EMPLOYEES OF A COMPANY. AND AND THE COMPANY IS SKIRTING THE LAW BY CLASSIFYING THEM AS INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS SAVING THE COMPANY ABOUT THIRTY PERCENT. TAKING FROM THE WORKERS THEMSELVES THESE WORKERS THESE DRIVERS ACTUALLY FILED SUIT THEY FILED WITH THE LABOR COMMISSIONER'S OFFICE AT LIKE I SAID THIS IS THIS PREDATES AB FIVE THIS HAS NOTHING EVEN. TO DO WITH AB FIVE BUT UNDER DIE I UNDER BROWN- PREVIOUSLY- BEEN FOUND MISCLASSIFIED AND THAT'S THOUSAND DRIVERS AT THE PORT OF LA. OKAY THE I WOULD JUST LIKE TO SAY THAT. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT YOU CAN BE. WITH THE LAWS WE HAVE TODAY I DON'T THINK IT'S REALLY HARD TO BE OUT OF CLASSIFICATION IF YOU PAY AN HOURLY WAGE. ARE YOU ACTUALLY OWN THE TRUCK YOURSELF THERE'S REALLY. FROM FROM MY INTERPRETATION OF THE LAWS THAT HAVE BEEN PASSED. ON AND WE BROUGHT A TRUCKING BUSINESS SO WE PAY HOURLY THERE THAT WITH THE MATTER WHAT IT'S OUR BECAUSE THERE'S IN YOUR NOSE WHERE COMPLIANCE I KNOW I'M IN COMPLIANCE THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO DON'T I COULD TELL YOU THE STORY I'M SORRY I DON'T WANNA GET INTO THIS BUT STORIES OF TRUCK DRIVERS. SHE LOST ME THEY HAD AT LEAST THEIR TRUCK FROM THE COMPANY. AND YOU KNOW THIS HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR DECADES BUT IT'S NOT YOU ARE BEING THE JUDGE AND JURY THE JUDGE HAS ALREADY FOUND THESE FOLKS OUT OF COMPLIANCE WE JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT THEY PAY THE FACT IS THAT THEY'RE NOT GETTING. TAXPAYER FUNDS IF THEY'RE BREAKING THE LAW. HE BUT I'M GLAD TO PAY HOURLY THAT'S GOT. THERE'S A BY THE WAY THERE IS A- A GOOD DESCRIPTION OF THE ISSUES THAT ARE DISCUSSED ON PAGE SIXTEEN AND IT GETS INTO THE- YOU KNOW THE LARA BILL WHERE THERE'S THIS LIST OF CARRIERS- THAT HAVEN'T SATISFIED COURT JUDGMENTS AND TAX ASSESSMENTS TAX LIENS SO. THOSE ARE THE FOLKS WHO ARE IMPLICATED HERE. OKAY THE BILL HAS BEEN MOVED BY A CENTRE GONZALEZ. WHO IS A COMING UP REALLY QUICKLY AND I WANTED TO JUST SPECIFY AND THE AUTHOR OF SB THREE THIRTY EIGHT SO IF YOU WANT TO CHAT ABOUT YOU KNOW. WHAT'S GOING ON IN OUR BACKYARD AND YOU KNOW MY BILL ACTUALLY- ARBIL. A BUILD OFF THE LARA BILL PUTTING PEOPLE ON THE BAD ACTOR LIST MULTIPLE OFFENDERS FOR GREGIS.
