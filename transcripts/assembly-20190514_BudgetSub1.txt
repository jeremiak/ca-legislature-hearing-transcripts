THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. BEN JOHNSON WITH LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE -- LE ON SUNDAY WE SENT OVER COMMENTS TO LEGISLATIVE STAFF -- RESPONDING TO THE GOVERNOR'S NEW PROPOSAL AND WE IN THAT WE PROVIDE AN ASSESSMENT SAYING THAT THERE'S WE FOUND IN A REVIEW THAT WE CONDUCTED EARLIER THIS YEAR ON MENTAL HEALTH WORKFORCE THAT THERE'S A MIXED EVIDENCE OF A STATEWIDE -- WORKFORCE SHORTAGE -- THOUGH WE DO FIND STRONGER EVIDENCE FOR CERTAIN PROFESSIONS NAMELY -- PSYCHIATRISTS -- WE ALSO FIND REGIONAL DISPARITIES -- DO EXIST HOWEVER IN TERMS OF MENTAL HEALTH WORK FORCE PARTICULARLY IN REGION WITH THE Q. CHARGES FOR EXAMPLE AND REGIONAL STATE LIKE THE INLAND EMPIRE AND SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. WE ALSO FOUND THAT THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AROUND THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EXISTING -- PROGRAMS AND STRATEGIES NOTING THAT WHERE IT BENEFITS WHERE BENEFICIARIES THE PROGRAMS TEND TO WORK AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED THEIR SERVICE OBLIGATIONS DON'T ALWAYS MATCH UP TO THE AREAS WITH THE HIGHEST NEED. AND WE DO SO WE DO PROVIDE -- SOME OPTIONS FOR LEGISLATIVE CONSIDERATION -- THE FIRST WOULD BE THAT TAKE PAUSE AND IDENTIFY THE STATE'S NEEDS IN THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE STRATEGIES -- BEFORE PROVIDING FUNDING. A SECOND WOULD BE TO SCALE BACK FUNDING AND INSTEAD REQUIRE -- AND REQUIRE A LOCAL CONTRIBUTION HISTORICALLY WET PROGRAMS ARE FUNDED -- BY WHAT WE SORT OF CONSIDER TO BE LOCAL -- MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING SO FUNDING THAT TODAY GOES -- TO GOES DIRECTLY TO COUNTY -- UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL IT WOULD BE EXCLUSIVELY SORT OF STATE AND WHICH IS A FUNDING THAT WOULD -- FUND THIS INVESTMENT AND SO WE DO THINK THAT IT COULD BE APPROPRIATE -- TO HAVE LOCALS -- THAT CHIP IN FUNDING FOR THIS PROGRAM AND THEN FINALLY WE DO -- GIVE OPTIONS OF ESTABLISHING TIGHTER PARAMETERS O HOW THIS FUNDING IS SPENT FOR EXAMPLE REALLY DIRECTING IT TO THE REGIONS OF THE STATE THAT -- WE DO FIND ARE FACING -- THE MOST ACUTE SHORTAGES. AND OR FOCUSING ON THE PROFESSIONS FOR WHICH THERE IS GREATER EVIDENCE OF UNDERSUPPLY SUCH AS FOR PSYCHIATRISTS AND THE OTHER PRESCRIBING PROFESSIONS SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS [inaudible] THANK YOU. I'M IN FINANCE. LORRAINE CHUNG DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE I'M. WILL DIFFER JOSH PAID FOR THE OTHER POINTS -- THAT WILL ALLOW OUR FOR THE OTHER POINTS AT THE LA -- PRODUCT BUT FOR THE ON OPTION TO SCALE BACK STATE FUNDING AND HAVING THE COUNTIES CONTRIBUTE MORE -- REJECTING THE COUNTY ON MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND DOLLARS ON TO THE WEB PLAN. HOW WOULD REQUIRE STATUTORY LANGUAGE AND -- AT THIS TIME WE'RE NOT PROPOSING. TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO CHANGE THE COUNTY ALLOCATIONS -- AND WE WOULD NOTE THAT -- THE STATUE THAT DIRECTED THE COUNTY MONEY FOR THE FIRST TEN YEARS. ON TO WHAT HAS SUNSET AND COUNTIES ARE NOT EXPECTING. TO BE ASKED TO MATCH NEED ANY NEW FUNDING AND THEY HAVE NOT BUDGETED FOR THIS COST -- SO THEY MAY HAVE YOUR MARK THE MONEY FOR OTHER PROGRAMS AND REQUIRING A MATCH ME ON BECAUSE DELAY TO IMPLEMENTATION -- AS FAR AS THE OTHER POINTS THAT WERE BROUGHT UP I WOULD DEFER. TO THE DEPARTMENT TO ADDRESS -- YEAH IN TERMS OF I THINK WE AGREE THAT THERE THE THERE'S A MAIL DISTRIBUTION THE OR FOR STATEWIDE -- AND THAT THERE ARE CERTAINLY MORE ACUTE. SHORTAGES IN CERTAIN PROFESSIONS A PSYCHIATRIST. WE ALSO JUST NOTE THAT THE THE WEB PLAN AND THE RELATED PROGRAMS -- HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED THIS OF A BEST PRACTICES WITH EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER ENGAGEMENT -- AND SUBJECT MATTER EXPERTS AND USUALLY THE FUNDS WITHIN THE WEB PLAN -- WILL BE ALLOCATED TO REGIONAL PARTNERSHIPS BASED OFF OF A LOCAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT SO THEY WOULD PUT FORTH A NEEDS ASSESSMENT TO DEMONSTRATE WHAT THEIR NEEDS ARE BOTH WITHIN WHICH PROGRAMS THEY WOULD FIND IN TERMS OF WHETHER IT'S SCHOLARSHIPS OR LOAN REPAYMENTS -- AS WELL AS WHICH PROFESSIONS THEY WOULD TARGET TO MEET THEIR LOCAL AND REGIONAL NEEDS THANK YOU. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD MORNING CHAIR MEMBERS SHERRY DAVIS CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS WE SUPPORT THIS ALLOCATION. THE PRIOR ALLOCATIONS TO THE WEB FUND WERE EXCLUSIVE TO PROP SIXTY THREE FUNDING WHICH EXCLUDED SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER PROFESSIONALS. FROM PARTICIPATING AND RECEIVING THOSE STATEMENTS AND BENEFITS. WITH THE NEW ALLOCATION INCLUDING FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS IN GENERAL FUND WE BELIEVE AT THIS TIME IS APPROPRIATE TO OPEN UP THAT FUNDING TWO SENTENCES DISORDER. PROFESSIONALS AS WELL THERE'S AN EXTREME SHORTAGE OF COUNSELORS AND IN THE MIDDLE OF AN OPIOID EPIDEMIC AND NOW. A WHITENING -- PSYCHOACTIVE AND STIMULANT. ABUSE SITUATION CALIFORNIA WE CERTAINLY THOSE FUNDS TO BE AVAILABLE. TO A SUBSISTENCE ORDER PROFESSIONALS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING PAULA WILL HOME REPRESENTING THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA. AND WE SUPPORT THIS INVESTMENT OF IMAGE AS A FUNDS IN STATEWIDE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS IN PRIORITIES AND WE KNOW THAT IT'S A CRITICAL TIME FOR WORKFORCE INVESTMENT AND WE AS COUNTIES RECOGNIZE THE NEED TO IMPROVE OUR PENETRATION RATES AND MEET THE NEEDS OF MORE CALIFORNIANS WITH MENTAL HEALTH CONDITIONS. COUNTIES ARE WORKING TO BUILD CONSISTENT HIGH QUALITY PROVIDER NETWORKS -- TO MEET THE NETWORK ADEQUACY STANDARDS UNDER THE MEDICAID MANAGED CARE FINAL RULE AND ADDRESSING THAT SPECIFIC -- SHORTAGES IN THE VARIOUS PROFESSIONS AND IN SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IS KEY TO DOING THIS -- AND WE WOULD AGREE THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO TARGET THE FUNDING TO AREAS OF GREATEST NEED AND PROFESSIONS WHERE -- SHORTAGES ARE MOST ACUTE AND WE THINK THAT AWESOME HEADS PLAN TO UTILIZE THE REGIONAL WET COLLABORATIVE'S TO HELP DIRECT AND TARGET FUNDING LOCALLY IS ONE EFFECTIVE STRATEGY FOR DOING THIS. THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KELLY BROOKS I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA HEALTHCARE DISTRICTS AND ON BEHALF OF THE RIVERSIDE COUNTY BOARD OF SUPERVISORS -- I'M HERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS FUNDING PROPOSAL I WOULD JUST POINT OUT THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE AND THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY HAVE THE LOWEST PROVIDER TO POPULATION RATIOS IN THE STATE FOR ALMOST EVERY SINGLE CATEGORY OF BEHAVIORAL HEALTH PROVIDERS -- FUNDING FOR ADDITIONAL WORK FORCE IS URGENTLY NEEDED PARTICULARLY AS WE ARE HAVING CONVERSATION STATEWIDE ABOUT EXPANDING ACCESS IN THE STATE YOU CAN EXPAND ACCESS IF YOU DON'T HAVE THE PROVIDERS THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU FOR REPRESENTING THE INLAND EMPIRE. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA SOCIETY OF ADDICTION MEDICINE. WHO IS TOTALLY INVOLVED IN PROP SIXTY THREE WE THINK THE WEB FUNDING SHOULD BE FOR ALL BEHAVIORAL HEALTH FIELDS? FOR EXAMPLE THERE IS A PERSON RIGHT I PERSONALLY KNOW WAS GETTING WET LOAN REPAYMENT WHEN THEY WERE WORKING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. THEY DIDN'T HAVE ENOUGH SUPERVISOR HOURS SO THEY CENTER OVER TO ANOTHER FACILITY THAT DOES SUBSTANCE ABUSE AND MENTAL HEALTH AND THEN THEY TOLD HER SHE COULDN'T GET HER LOAN REPAID ANYMORE. SO IT'S LIKE IT'S CRAZY THERE CO MORBID SO MANY TIMES THAT IF IF YOU DON'T ALLOW IT FOR BOTH SIDES. YOU AREN'T ACTUALLY DOING WHAT WHAT THE INITIATIVE WAS INTENDED TO ADDRESS WHICH IS WHY THERE IS A SUBSTANCE USE DOCTOR ON THE OVERSIGHT COMMISSION. BECAUSE IT WAS INTENDED TO DEAL WITH THE WHOLE COMPLEX ARRAY OF MENTAL SUBS OUR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH ISSUES THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS FAIR IMITATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES WERE IN SUPPORT OF THIS PROPOSAL -- COUNTIES ARE DESPERATE FOR MENTAL HEALTH PRACTITIONERS WE APPRECIATE IT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU. ALL RIGHT LET'S BRING IT BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. YES MISTER FRAZIER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR SO WHEN WE TALK ABOUT RESTRICTIONS ON IT AND CLASSIFICATION OF OF WHAT PROFESSION I GUESS. WHEN WE LOOK AT THE ID POPULATION ARE WE GOING IN AND AND AND BEHAVIORAL HEALTH BECAUSE OF THE ADVENT OF THE WAR THE DUAL DIAGNOSIS IS NOW? ARE WE GONNA HAVE A CATEGORY THAT ACTUALLY. HAS A PROFESSIONAL THAT CAN ACTUALLY. ADDRESS. THE IDT COMPONENT PLUS THE MENTAL HEALTH CHALLENGES I GO ON HOW FOR FOR A TRAINING PROGRAM -- I'M NOT SURE I'D HAVE TO GET BACK TO YOU. I WOULD REALLY APPRECIATE BECAUSE I THINK THAT. WHEN WE START SEILING? ONE SPECIFIC CHALLENGE THE WEEK ALLEVIATE ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER I ONE OF THE THINGS IT SEEMS LIKE A THEME THAT I KEEP SEEING IN MANY OF THE ANALYSIS IS THAT -- THE INLAND EMPIRE SANJOAQUIN. ARE -- BEHIND IN SO MANY WAYS. AND I THINK THAT FOR ME I'VE ALWAYS WHEN I'VE TAUGHT AT HOLLY I ALWAYS TALKED ABOUT THE CONCEPT OF EQUITY VERSUS EQUALITY. THE BEFORE WE CAN START BRINGING EVERYBODY UP TO THE SITE TO GIVING EVERYBODY THE SAME THING. THOSE WHO ARE BEHIND HAVE TO BE BROUGHT UP. SO THAT WE DO HAVE EQUITY. AT IN THERE'S A SERIOUS PROBLEM AYE AYE I WOULD REQUEST VERY% SPECIFICALLY. THAT IF WE KNOW THAT THE INLAND EMPIRE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY. ARE SO BEHIND AND THEY HAVE SUCH A GREAT NEED THAT IS ALREADY DOCUMENTED. THEN I I WOULD ANTICIPATE THAT THERE ISN'T GOING TO BE ANOTHER STUDY TO DETERMINE. HOW FAR BEHIND THE ARE WE ALREADY KNOW THERE BEHIND -- BUT I HEAR YOU LOUD AND CLEAR ABOUT DOING A REGIONAL NEEDS ASSESSMENT. I HOPE THAT DOESN'T INCLUDE. THIS ASPECT OF IT -- BECAUSE IT'S ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED. IS THAT SOMETHING THAT WE CAN COUNT ON I WOULD BELIEVE THAT THE THE NEEDS ASSESSMENT WHICH YOU'VE CORROBORATE. THAT THERE ARE SHORTAGES THERE AND THEN THE FUNDING WOULD BE TARGETED IN AREAS WHERE THERE IS THE GREATEST NEED. DO WE NEED ANOTHER NEEDS ASSESSMENT. THE WAY TO THE NEEDS DOESN'T WORK IS THAT THE COUNTIES WOULD PUT FORTH -- MORE LIKE PROPOSALS ABOUT HOW THE FUNDING WOULD BE ALLOCATED WITHIN THE WEB PLAN AND WITHIN THE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS -- AND AND HOW THEY WOULD USE THE FUNDS TO AS I SAID. I ALLOCATE BETWEEN PIPELINE A RECRUITMENT ACTIVITIES SCHOLARSHIPS LOAN REPAYMENT BECAUSE ONE REGION MIGHT HAVE A NEED FOR LOAN REPAYMENT TO RETAIN THEIR EXISTING WORKFORCE WHERE IS ANOTHER REGION MAY HAVE A HIGHER NEED FOR SCHOLARSHIPS -- AND SO THAT WOULD START TO DRIVE HOW THAT FUNDING WOULD WORK AND THROUGH THIS NEEDS ASSESSMENT I THINK WE WOULD SEE THE EXACT SAME THINGS. THIS IS A LITTLE MORE DETAILED AND EXACTLY WHERE THE SHORTAGES ARE ABOUT HOW THE REGION'S WOULD ADDRESS THESE ISSUES THAT HAVE BEEN DOCUMENTED -- AT THE THINK ONE ISSUE THAT WE'RE WE'RE BEGINNING TO EXPLORE IS THAT THE OFTEN FOR TO GET FUNDING THROUGH THE EXISTING STATE PROGRAMS -- YOU CAN QUALIFY UNDER A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT CRITERIA SUCH AS THE NUMBER OF MEDICAID LIVES OR SORT OF A OTHER GENERAL CRITERIA WHETHER OR NOT YOUR SAFETY NET CLINIC AND SO FORTH. AND WHILE -- SERVING THOSE GROUPS OF PEOPLE WITH THE YOU KNOW AND PROVIDING ADDITIONAL -- WORK FORCE FOR THOSE GROUPS IS ABSOLUTELY LAUDABLE IT COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF NOT NECESSARILY -- GOD DIRECTING THE THE FUNDING TOWARDS SAY SPECIFIC REGIONS AND SO FOR THE COULD DILUTED A LITTLE BIT THROUGHOUT THE STATE AND BE CREATING SOME OF THAT MISMATCH BUT WE'RE FINDING BETWEEN -- WHERE BENEFICIARIES END UP WORKING AFTER THEY'VE COMPLETED THERE'S -- OBLIGATIONS AND WHERE THE MOST ACUTE NEEDS ARE. IT ANOTHER CONCERN AND IT'S BEEN BROUGHT UP IN THIS COMMITTEE AS WELL AS OTHERS IS THAT OFTENTIMES FUNDING GOES TO THOSE. WHO ARE MOST ADEPT AT WRITING GRANTS? AND WRITE BEEN DESCRIBING THE NEED AS OPPOSED TO THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEED -- THAT WAS TRUE WHEN WE DISCUSS THE WILD FIRES AND HOW THERE WAS GREAT NEED IN SOME AREAS BUTTHEY DIDN'T HAVE. THE PERSONNEL TO PUT TOGETHER THE GROUNDS AND SO. RETHINKING HOW FUNDING IS ALLOCATED SO THAT IT REALLY DOES GO TO THOSE WITH THE GREATEST NEED AND SOMETIMES THAT REQUIRES MORE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. TO BE SURE THAT AGAIN THAT WERE. LOOKING AT EQUITY TO PROVIDE THOSE WHO MOST NEED IT TO BRING THEM UP. TO AN APPROPRIATE LEVEL -- EIGHT ANOTHER QUESTION I HAVE IS. DOES THE WEB PLAN SEEK TO LEVERAGE OTHER FUNDING. FOR THE DEFERRED. CHECK MY DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AT THIS POINT TIME OR SIMPLY REQUESTING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES ACT FUNDING AND THERE'S NO ADDITIONAL FUNDING BUILT INTO. THIS REQUEST THAT WOULD HELP FUND WHAT IMPLEMENTATION. AT THE STATE LEVEL OR COUNTY LEVEL. THE LA AND IF I IF I MAY ADD A IS THAT THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE REYES DE GOOD POINTS ON SORT OF WHAT THAT WHAT IT WOULD TAKE TO SORT OF REQUIRE A LOCAL LOCAL MATCH AND SO FORTH THE ONLY THING I WOULD ADD HERE IS THAT. THE LOCALS DO GET -- A PORTION OF THEIR IMAGES A FUNDING CAN BE USED FOR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS UP 215% OF THEIR ANNUAL ALLOCATIONS -- WHICH IS ABOUT TWO BILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY ONE OPTION WOULD BE -- TO POTENTIALLY BE TO SORT OF HAVE THEM MATCH YOU KNOW STAY CONTRIBUTIONS TO EITHER STATE OR REGIONAL PROGRAMS OR HAVE THEM FUND SORT OF THROUGH THE AND CREATE THEIR OWN REGIONAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH USING THEIR OWN FUNDING TO TO SUPPORT SOME OF THESE WORKFORCE ACTIVITIES. WOULD YOU LIKE TO RESPOND. AGAIN I THINK TO MAKE THAT REQUIREMENT WOULD REQUIRED TRAILER BILL STATUTORY CHANGES. I ALSO NOTE THE CONCERNS THAT YOU REYES RELATED -- TO DIFFERENT REGIONS IN THE STATE HAVING DIFFERENT CAPACITIES TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES I THINK REQUIRING A LOCAL MATCH FOR THESE DOLLARS MAY EXACERBATE THOSE ISSUES. AS SOMETHING TO CONSIDER. AND SOMETIMES IT'S IT SOMETIMES WHAT'S NEEDED IS CAPACITY BUILDING -- AT THE VERY LEAST THAT THE VERY LEVEL THAT WE WHERE IT'S MOST NEEDED -- WHAT EVIDENCE IS THERE THAT THE LAST WHAT PLAN WORKED -- SO WE'VE CONDUCTED QUITE A BIT OF THE OF ANALYSIS ON THE FIRST THREE YEARS OF IMPLEMENTATION AND WE FOUND THAT. MOST OF THE RECIPIENTS INDICATED THAT IT'S NOT THAT THE AWARDS THEY RECEIVED STRONGLY CONTRIBUTED TO THEIR DECISION TO STAY WITHIN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. RAISES SOME OF THE DATA THAT WE HAVE WILL TAKE A LONGER TIME FRAME TO COME UP WITH MORE COMPELLING STATISTICS -- IN THAT. SOMEBODY WHO RECEIVED AN AWARD AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN HAS ONLY BEEN ABLE TO STAY WITHIN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM TODAY FOR THREE YEARS SO WHEN WE SAY THAT THE PEOPLE. WHO RECEIVED AWARDS HAVE STAYED WITHIN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM ON AVERAGE A LITTLE OVER TWO YEARS THAT'S BECAUSE? ABOUT TWO AND A HALF OR THREE YEARS HAVE PASSED SINCE WE WERE ABLE TO DO THIS SURVEY -- SO WE THINK THAT WITH LONGER TERM STUDIES WILL BE ABLE TO COME UP WITH A MORE COMPELLING STORY BUT THE IMMEDIATE. DATA THAT WE DO HAVE INDICATES IT IS STRONGLY CONTRIBUTES TO PEOPLE'S DECISION TO STAY WITHIN THE PUBLIC MENTAL HEALTH SYSTEM. THANK YOU. FOR THE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. MS REVIEW THANK YOU I'M JUST A HEARING. A LOT OF GIVE US THE MONEY AND THEY WILL TELL YOU LATER. BOB HOW HOW THIS WORKED SO MAYBE IF YOU CAN PROVIDE US SOME DATA ON THE SUCCESS OF THE PROGRAM OR ON THE SUCCESS THAT YOU JUST INDICATED I REALLY FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE AND AUTHORIZING ANOTHER HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AYE. I THINK -- YOU KNOW WE GET TO THE POINT WHERE. NOW THAT WE HAVE THE ME REVISE AND EVERYBODY'S EXCITED ABOUT HOW MUCH MONEY WE HAVE WHICH IS KIND OF TELLING THEM THE MANY OUT AND YOU KNOW MAYBE SOME EVIDENCE. TO THE SUCCESS AND ALSO TO THE POINT AND I WANNA THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THAT UP ABOUT THE CAPACITY IS THERE ANY PLANS TO HELP THOSE THAT DON'T HAVE THAT CAPACITY OF SYSTEM. THE TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE OR HAVE WE EVEN PROVIDED TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO THOSE FOLKS THAT DIDN'T HAVE THE CAPACITY SO THAT THEY CAN OBTAIN THIS MONEY. I'M REALLY NOT SURE KIND OF WHAT THE QUESTION I'M ASKING BUT IS THERE A WAY TO IDENTIFY WHO HAS GOTTEN I'M SURE YOU HAVE WHO HAD GOTTEN IT WHAT REGION'S THEY ARE. AND AND IF WE ARE TALKING ABOUT CAPACITY I VENTURE TO SAY THAT THOSE THAT SEMINAR DINO IN SOUTH SAN JOAQUIN OR EVEN THE CENTRAL VALLEY FOLKS. HAVE NOT -- TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE THE TECHNICAL CAPACITY TO OBTAIN THOSE PLANS TO A WE CAN CERTAINLY PROVIDE YOU WITH SOME ADDITIONAL INFORMATION OR AROUND THE OUTCOMES AND SOME SUMMARY INFORMATION ABOUT THE OUTCOMES THAT WE'VE PUBLISHED IN THE TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY TWENTY FIVE WHAT PLAN. AND AND THEN WE CAN ALSO SHARE WITH YOU SOME INFORMATION AROUND WHERE THE FUNDING HAS BEEN TARGETED WE HAD SOME PRETTY -- INFORMATIVE MAPS THAT SHOW SORT OF FUNNY PER CAPITA AND WHERE IT WAS MOST HEAVILY TARGETED -- I WOULD KNOW THERE WAS QUITE A BIT ON A PER CAPITA BASIS THAT WAS FUNDED TOWARDS THE THE CENTRAL VALLEY IN THE INLAND EMPIRE AS WELL. BUT SO WHAT WILL PROVIDE THAT THANK YOU AND WHAT I ALSO WOULD LIKE TO HEAR AND YOU KNOW WE WE SIT HERE AND WE HEAR A LOT OF YOU KNOW NUMBERS AND DATA AND I ALSO WANT TO HEAR -- IN NOT TODAY OBVIOUSLY BY I GUESS IN THE FUTURE FOR WHAT I WOULD LIKE TO HEAR IS YOU THINKING OUTSIDE OF JUST THE MONEY AND ADDRESSING ISSUES -- LIKE THE CHAIRWOMAN -- MENTIONED ABOUT HOW WE CAN ASSIST THOSE LOWER. A CAPACITY FOLKS I MEAN BECAUSE I I UNDERSTAND YOUR JOB APPEARS TO TELL US THIS IS WHAT WE NEED THIS IS HOW WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BUT AT SOME POINT. YOU KNOW THERE'S GOT TO BE SOME -- I DON'T THINKING ABOUT HOW WE SUPPORT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE ACCESS AND I'M NOT HEARING THAT. I'M HEARING YOU KNOW WE'RE GOING TO GIVE YOU A HUNDRED MILLION AND THIS IS WHAT WE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA DO BY. LOOKING FORWARD -- CAN WE FORMULATE A PLAN OR MAYBE SOMETHING IN WRITING TO HELP US. HELP YOU HELP THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY SHOULD I THINK WE CAN ALSO PROVIDES MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ABOUT WITH THE STEPS THAT WE HAVE TAKEN TO TRY TO ENSURE THAT WE'RE WORKING WITH PEOPLE ACROSS THE STATE AND NOT JUST THOSE WHO HAVE THE MOST CAPACITY. TO PUT TOGETHER A GRANT PROPOSAL ON HOW WE REALLY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO ENGAGE PEOPLE -- ACROSS ALL REGIONS AND ACROSS THE ENTIRETY OF THE STATE TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY HAS -- EQUITABLE ACCESS TO THIS FUNDING TO SUPPORT THEIR PUBLIC AND HEALTH SYSTEM WORKFORCE NEEDS THANK YOU AND I DO YOU KNOW WHEN YOU CAN PROVIDE THAT INFORMATION FOR ME. OUR FOR US FOR THE COMMITTEE. IT SHORTLY [inaudible] CERTAINLY ANYTHING. WE CAN TRY TO GET SOMETHING TO YOU WITHIN THE NEXT WEEK OR SO OKAY. PERFECT THANK YOU. THANK YOU PLEASE PROVIDED TO STAFF -- IT WILL THEN BE PROVIDED TO THE REST OF THE MEMBERS [inaudible] VERY GOOD. THANK YOU SO MUCH LET'S MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER THREE DIRECTOR. GOOD MORNING GO AHEAD. GREAT SO GOOD MORNING JENNIFER CAN AS DIRECTOR FOR THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES AND I'M JOINED BY -- G. C. COOPER AS SENIOR ADVISER FOR A PROGRAMS AND POLICY AND SHE'LL TAKE US THROUGH THE FIRST COUPLE ITEMS. GOOD MORNING I'M SO I'LL PROVIDE AN OVERVIEW OF THE DH CS BUDGET -- AS PROVIDED IN THE MAY REVISION SO FOR FISCAL YEAR NINETEEN TWENTY THE GOVERNOR'S NAY REVISION INCLUDES A TOTAL OF A HUNDRED SIX BILLION DOLLARS FOR THE SUPPORT OF THE ACS PROGRAMS AND SERVICES -- OF THAT ABOUT A HUNDRED AND A STEP OR SORRY EIGHT HUNDRED AND SEVENTY THREE MILLION IS FOR STATE OPERATIONS -- I WOULD NOTE THAT IS INCLUDES AN INCREASE OF ONE POINT FOUR BILLION DOLLAR FUNDS FOR THE AND A HUNDRED AND FORTY ONE GENERAL FUND -- FROM THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THIS PROPOSAL ALSO INCLUDES THE ESTABLISHMENT OF EIGHTEEN PERMANENT POSITIONS -- IN A CONVERSION OF THIRTEEN EXISTING LIMITED TORT LIMITED TERM RESOURCES TO PERMANENT POSITIONS. SO KEY ADJUSTMENTS FROM THE JANUARY TO MAY -- REVISION INCLUDE TIMING EVERY PAYMENTS OF OF FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- DUE BACK IN SO MANY EARLY SEEING ADJUSTMENT FROM CURRENT YEAR TO BUDGET YEAR IN REGARDS THE TIMING OF THOSE PAY BACKS. YOU ALSO SEE AN INCREASE SAVINGS FROM THE DRUG REBATES IN AND JUST MEANT TO CASELOADS WE ARE SEEING -- AN AVERAGE MONTHLY CASELOAD OF SLIGHTLY OVER THIRTEEN MILLION WHICH IS A DECREASE FROM GOVERNOR'S BUDGET SUGGESTS NOTING THAT -- OTHER NEW. DECREASE CORRECT. OTHER NOTABLE PROGRAM CHANGES -- WHICH WE WILL GO OVER IN THE HEARING TODAY -- INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS IN PROP FIFTY SIX ADDITIONAL SUPPORT FOR A WHOLE PERSON CARE LIKE PROGRAMS. YOUR RUN MENTAL HEALTH WARM LINE PROP SIXTY FOUR PHARMACY BENEFIT TRANSITIONS THE FEE FOR SERVICE AND FULL SCOPE EXPANSION IMPLEMENTATION SHIP TO JANUARY. ONE TWENTY TWENTY SO SINCE WE WILL DISCUSS THOSE ITEMS IN MORE DETAIL ON THAT IS THE UPDATE THAT WE HAVE FOR THE MAY REVISION. THANK YOU DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. NO COMMENT HELLO. RIGHT WELL THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE IN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS WE'VE DONE A PRELIMINARY REVIEW OF THE UPDATED MEDI CAL ESTIMATE. AND DON'T HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS TO RAISE AT THIS TIME. WE WILL HAVE COMMENTS ON SEVERAL OF THE ITEMS THAT THE DEPARTMENT MENTIONED. AS THEY COME UP LATER IN THE AGENDA TODAY. BUT FROM A HIGH LEVEL WE'D LIKE TO HIGHLIGHT THAT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT OF GENERAL FUND SPENDING IN MEDICARE NOW. IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN IS NOW. DOWN -- FROM THE ESTIMATE AT THE TWENTY EIGHTEEN NINETEEN BUDGET ACT BY THREE POINT THREE BILLION DOLLARS. THAT REPRESENTS -- 14%. OF OF THE AMOUNT OF SPENDING THAT WAS ESTIMATED AT THAT TIME -- SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO ESTIMATED MEDI CAL SPENDING -- HAVE BECOME COMMON. AND CONSIDERING THAT MEDI CAL IS A MAJOR GENERAL FUND EXPENDITURE. THESE UNANTICIPATED ADJUSTMENTS CAN INTERFERE WITH THE LEGISLATURE'S ABILITY TO FORMULATE A PURSUE. LONGER TERM FISCAL PLANS AND COMPLEXITY -- IN THE MEDICAL BUDGET ALSO CREATE CHALLENGES FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO PROVIDE OVERSIGHT OF THE PROGRAM. IN JANUARY THE ADMINISTRATION REQUESTED FUNDING FOR SOME NEW POSITIONS. THAT ARE INTENDED TO BETTER ESTIMATE AND TRACK. MEDI CAL EXPENDITURES THE ADMINISTRATION HAS ALSO PROPOSED -- AS AS NOTED IN THE AGENDA TO CREATE A SPECIAL FUND TO SMOOTH THE IMPACT OF DRUG REBATES WHICH IS AN AREA WHERE THERE IS I'M PARTICULARLY -- LARGE UNCERTAINTY -- WE CONTINUE TO RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE APPROVE THOSE REQUESTED POSITIONS. AND TO CREATE THE DRUG REBATES SPECIAL FUND INCLUDING THE ALLOCATION OF A HUNDRED SEVENTY TWO MILLION DOLLARS. INTO THAT FUND -- AS INCLUDED IN THE MAYOR VISION. WE FURTHER RECOMMEND THAT THE LEGISLATURE DIRECT. THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES TO SHARE KEY INFORMATION WITH THE LEGISLATURE THAT WOULD BE GAINED. FROM THE POSITIONS THAT I'VE BEEN REQUESTED -- FOR EXAMPLE AN ADDITIONAL MADE YOUR UPDATES ON CASH FLOWS IN KEY PROGRAM COMPONENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT -- TO PARTICULAR UNCERTAINTY. FINALLY RECOMMENDED THE LEGISLATURE REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO PREPARE A PLAN THAT WOULD BE PRESENTED TO THE LEGISLATURE WITH LONGER TERM -- CHANGES TO IMPROVE MEDI CAL ESTIMATES AND BUDGETING. AND TO BEGIN THIS WITH -- AN INCLUSIVE PROCESS THAT WOULD INVOLVE -- STAFF FROM LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE AND OTHER LEGISLATIVE STAFF TO HELP IDENTIFY KEY PRIORITIES FOR SUCH LONGER TERM CHANGES. THANK YOU PUBLIC COMMENT. RUBBER WASTE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA -- HEALTH LEAD SERVICES -- CHAIR MEMBERS OF WE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT. PERCENTAGE WIENER WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS BUT NOT ENOUGH GRANULAR INFORMATION TO ASSESS. ACOSTA IN IMPLEMENTATION PARTICULARLY THE PHARMACY BENEFIT TO FEE FOR SERVICE. TRANSITION UNDER CONSIDERATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS MEGAN SUPERS ON BEHALF OF CALIFORNIA HEALTH PLUS ADVOCATES THE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS AND CLINICS IN CALIFORNIA -- INCLUDED IN THE MEDICAL ESTIMATE AT AS YOU JUST HEARD WAS THE PHARMACY BENEFIT TRANSITION TO FEE FOR SERVICE. I KNOW THAT MANY OF YOU HAVE HEARD FROM US AND FROM OUR HEALTH CENTERS ABOUT THE CONCERN. OF THE IMPACT OF THIS PROPOSAL ON THE THREE FORTY B. DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM AND WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN FOR SERVICES THAT ARE FUNDED WITH THE USE OF THOSE SAVINGS -- I WOULD SUBMIT TO YOU THAT WE ARE STILL A LITTLE BIT UNCLEAR ABOUT WHERE THESE THREE HUNDRED NINETY THREE MILLION DOLLAR. GENERAL STEP SAVINGS ARE COMING FROM IF THEY'RE NOT COMING FROM THE THREE FORTY B. PROGRAM WHICH IS WHAT. OUR CONCERN IS THAT THAT TRANSITION FROM A MANAGED CARE TO FEE FOR SERVICE ENVIRONMENTAL DIRECTLY POOL DOLLARS FROM THE THREE FORTY B. DRUG DISCOUNT PROGRAM. AND SO TO THE EXTENT OF THE LEGISLATURE IS ABLE -- TO ASK FOR THINGS LIKE -- DETAILED FISCAL ANALYSIS ABOUT WHERE THE DOLLARS ARE COMING FROM A CONVENING A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS OF AUG A COVERED ENTITIES. AND PLANS IN A LIKE STAKEHOLDERS TO TO FIGURE OUT WHERE THE SAVINGS ARE COMING FROM -- WE WOULD APPRECIATE THAT AND I THINK YOU. AND IF KELLY BROOKS IS NOT BEHIND ME SHE ASKED ME TO EXPRESS A ME TOO ON BEHALF OF THE PUBLIC HOSPITALS THANK YOU THANK YOU [inaudible] THIS FRAZIER. THANK YOU MISTER -- GOT THIS SORT OF CONSTITUENTS JUST UP THE MAY REVISE CAME OUT [inaudible] SHOP RIGHT -- THAT IT SAYS THAT -- THIRD THE UNDERSTANDINGS THEY HAVE LEARNED ABOUT A PROPOSED CUT TO MEDI CAL PHARMACY REIMBURSEMENT FOR BLOOD CAUGHT BLOOD CLOTTING FACTORS. BY THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES. OTHER CURRENT PROPOSAL REDUCES ALL DRAMATIC CLASSROOM. REIMBURSED SPECIALLY PHARMACIES WHICH CREEK INDIVIDUALS OF HIM A FEW FILIA. CAN YOU. OF COURSE I'M NOT SURE SO -- THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY PART OF THE BUDGET THERE WERE -- FEDERAL REQUIREMENTS THAT CAME OUT -- A FEW YEARS AGO THEY LOOKED NATIONALLY IT STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS AND THE WAY IN WHICH STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS PURCHASED -- BLOOD FACTOR AND OTHER DRUGS -- RELATED TO HEMOPHILIA AND THEY ESSENTIALLY REQUIRED STATE MEDICAID PROGRAMS TO COME BACK AND BREAK UP WHAT WAS A BUNDLED PAYMENT FOR SUCH SERVICES -- IT WAS ESSENTIALLY AVERAGE WHOLESALE PRICE. MINUS 20% I THINK WAS HOW THE PRICING WORKED AND SO WE SPENT A LOT OF TIME WITH -- THE STAKEHOLDERS WE GOT A LOT OF DATA FROM LIKE THE METRIC HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTERS IN WHICH WE WANTED TO UNDERSTAND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH THE PRODUCT ITSELF AS WELL AS THE SERVICES. THAT KIND OF WENT ALONG WITH THE MANAGEMENT AND THE CARE COORDINATION FOR SUCH PATIENTS -- SO WE WORK BOTH WITH OUR STAKEHOLDERS AS WELL AS THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO SAY DOES THIS NEW -- REIMBURSEMENT METHODOLOGY. WORK AND SO IT WAS KIND OF LIKE A BACK AND FORTH WITH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WHERE AND WE FILED A DRAFT STATE PLAN AMENDMENTS -- PROBABLY. IT WAS IT WAS LAST YEAR BUT I WOULD HAVE TO GIVE YOU THE DATE IN WHICH WE SAID HERE'S THE NEW METHODOLOGY FOR HOW WE WOULD REIMBURSE AND WE ESSENTIALLY BROKE. THOSE THAT THAT ARE HEMOPHILIA TREATMENT CENTERS THAT HAVE KIND OF AN ACKNOWLEDGE LEVEL OF STAFFING VERSUS SPECIALTY PHARMACIES WHICH DO NOT AND THERE'S A DIFFERENT PAYMENT MECHANISM PER UNIT -- BASED ON THAT AND SO IN SOME CASES IT HAS REDUCED -- SOME PEOPLES -- PERCENTAGE BECAUSE IT WAS JUST A MARK UP ON THE ACTUAL COST OF THE DRUG BUT I'M HAPPY TO PROVIDE YOU WITH THE STATE PLAN AMENDMENT AND AND SOME OF THE BACKUP DETAIL. BUT I'D LOVE FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO COULD CONTACT THIS -- CONSTITUENTS WHO REACHED OUT BECAUSE I DON'T WANT THEM FALLING RACKS OKAY THEY WERE HAPPY TO DO THAT IS A MISINTERPRETATION OF WHAT WAS YEAH IF YOU WANT TO JUST PROVIDE ME THE NAME AFTER THE ABSENT AFTER AGAIN HAPPY TO DO THAT.

THIS IS IN ADDITION TO THE HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION THAT WAS PROPOSED TO THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET BRINGING THE TOTAL INVESTMENT TO THAT TWO HUNDRED TWO HUNDRED FIFTY MILLION. THE DEPARTMENT SEEKS THIS IS A VERY IMPORTANT INVESTMENT AS WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT BEHAVIORAL HEALTH INTEGRATION ACROSS OUR DELIVERY SYSTEMS -- TO ENSURE THAT INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE TRANSITIONING. BETWEEN DELIVERY SYSTEMS HAVE APPROPRIATE CARE COORDINATION SERVICES TO RECEIVE THE APPROPRIATE SERVICES. AND TO MAKE SURE THAT PROVIDERS OFFICES CAN MEET THE NEED FOR MEDICARE BENEFICIARIES.

BUT THEN STILL SUNSET THEM ANYWAY THAT WOULD -- THAT WOULD THAT PROBABLY WOULDN'T NECESSARILY BE THE THE THE MOST PART PRUDENT SORT OF POLICY -- DECISION THERE AND IT AND THEN ALSO JUST THAT IT SETS -- IT SETS US UP -- FOR POTENTIAL -- FISCAL ISSUES IF THOSE DO IF WE DO NOT SUNSET THEM -- TO WE DO ALSO HAVE SOME OUTSTANDING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS OF THE VALUE BASED PAYMENT PROPOSALS -- WILL HEAR AN ITEM LATER TODAY ABOUT IMPROVED -- OVERSIGHT -- OF MEDI CAL MANAGED CARE PLANS AND AND AND WE FIND THAT A LOT OF THE WAYS IN WHICH THE STATE IS INTENDING TO REALLY INCREASE ITS OVERSIGHT. OVER THOSE PLANS COINCIDE QUITE CLOSELY WITH THE VALUE BASED PAYMENTS AND SO WE DO HAVE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE COST EFFECTIVENESS BOTH PAYING SUPPLEMENTAL PAYMENTS THROUGH PROPOSITION. FIFTY SIX AND REQUIRING IMPROVE PERFORMANCE AND ALSO PAYING FOR IMPROVED PERFORMANCE SEPARATELY THROUGH THE CAPITATED RATES SO HAPPY TO TAKE ANY QUESTIONS THANK YOU.

TAX -- OR OTHER REVENUE -- OTHER THAN ONE TIME FUNDS WOULD BE BEST SUITED TO FUND THE RESTORATION OF OPTICAL BENEFITS AND ALSO THE OTHER BENEFITS THAT WERE CUT DURING THE RECESSION. FIFTY SIX IS PASSED BY THE VOTERS WAS INTENDED TO INCREASE ACCESS VIA PAYMENTS TO PROVIDERS RATHER THAN THE BENEFITS COVERED. OR INCREASING THE NUMBER OF BENEFICIARIES COVERED BY MEDICARE.

TWENTY TWENTY ONE INSTEAD WE REQUEST THE SUBCOMMITTEE TAKE ACTION REGARDING THE DEPARTMENT AB OR DIRECTING THE DEPARTMENT.

LET'S BRING YOU BACK TO THE COMMITTEE. MISTER RAMOS THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND DEALING WITH -- THE MEDICALLY A FRAGILE CHILDREN FRAGILE CHILDREN THE P. AT CHECK A SUBACUTE WE TALK ABOUT THOSE ISSUES ELEVEN YOUR FREEZE AND TRYING TO GET THOSE PAYMENTS -- TO WHERE THEY NEED TO BE HAS THERE BEEN ANY MORE DISCUSSION OR IN THIS -- REVISED TO START TO ADDRESS SOME OF THOSE THOSE AREAS OF CONCERN -- I WOULD. I WOULD SAY THE LEGISLATURE -- PROVIDED A ONE TIME AUGMENTATION I'M LOOKING AT MY FINANCE COLLEAGUES LAST YEAR ON THE FREE STANDING PEDIATRIC SUB ACUTE -- THAT HAS NOT BEEN -- RE PROPOSED IN THIS GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION OBVIOUSLY -- I THINK AS THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION WORK -- TO BECOME YOU KNOW CLOSER IN TERMS OF WHAT THE SPENDING -- PLAN IS OVER ALL I THINK WE'RE STILL OBVIOUSLY OPEN TO PROVIDING LIKE EITHER DATE OUR TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE BUT IT'S A CHANGE IN THOSE RATES HAS NOT BEEN PROPOSED AS PART OF THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET. THANK YOU AND AND DISCUSSION ON THE ELEVEN YOU'RE A FREEZE ON SOME OF THOSE RATES. HAS THAT ALSO BEEN -- NOT DISCUSSED IT WOULD BE MORE IN THE LEGISLATURE IN THOSE PROPOSALS COMING FOR BEFORE US SO WE HAVE AS A DEPARTMENT WITH PROVIDERS -- INCLUDING THE AYE CFT DIS -- THERE HAVE BEEN DISCUSSIONS WITH OTHER TYPES OF SPECIALTY FACILITIES INCLUDING THE PEDIATRIC SUBACUTE -- I THINK THEY'VE PROVIDED -- SOME DATA AN INPUT TO MY FINANCE SEEN TEAM -- AND STAFF ABOUT -- IF WE WERE GOING TO CHANGE A METHODOLOGY AND A RATE METHODOLOGY GOING FORWARD WHAT WOULD THAT. LOOK LIKE AND HOW COULD IT BE CALCULATED I THINK THAT -- ANYTHING THAT WE AS AN ADMINISTRATION WOULD PROPOSE WOULD OBVIOUSLY BE YOU KNOW IN CONCERT WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AND THEN WOULD BE REFLECTED MOST. APPROPRIATELY AND LIKE A BUDGET -- YOU KNOW BY THE GOVERNOR EITHER ON A JANUARY OR ME TYPE OF BASIS BUT AT THIS POINT IN TIME WE HAVEN'T -- PROPOSED ANYTHING DIFFERENT BUT WE ARE ALWAYS OPEN TO LOOKING AT METHODOLOGIES TO SAY IS THERE SOMETHING THAT. WE COULD DO DIFFERENTLY OR OR CALCULATE IN A WAY THAT WOULD. YOU KNOW BETTER REFLECT THE THE COSTS INVOLVED. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THAT TOO AND IN OUR OFFICE IS OPEN TO SET A MEETING TO REALLY TRY TO UNDERSTAND THAT I THINK. IN OUR AREA IN THE ASSEMBLY FORTY TH DISTRICT INLAND EMPIRE AREA. WE HAVE A A LARGE NEED -- THAT'S THERE AND I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE THAT AS WE CONTINUE TO TALK IN THE DIALOGUE WAS FORWARD WITH THE MEDI CAL REIMBURSEMENT. RATES AND ALL THAT WE DON'T FORGET ABOUT THE MEDICALLY FRAGILE CHILDREN ALSO THAT NEED THOSE SERVICES DRASTICALLY. IT MOVED OVER INTO -- PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- LAST YEAR I BELIEVE BUT LET'S MAKE SURE THAT THAT DIALOGUE AND THEIR VOICES STILL BE HEARD IN ALL THESE DIFFERENT DISCUSSIONS THAT ARE GOING ON THANK YOU THANK YOU VENTURE. THANK YOU MISTER HONEST DOCTOR WOULD. YES SIR THANK THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR I'M AND MAKE SOME COMMENTS OF SIMILAR TO WHAT I MADE LAST NIGHT AND AND I'M. I'M DISAPPOINTED BY THIS TREND LAST NIGHT WE HEARD. THAT -- SOME PROVIDER INCREASES FOR OUR FOR FOR THE AYE DDS COMMUNITY WOULD ALSO BE POTENTIALLY SON SAID IT. NOW WE'RE SO YOU'RE HEARING THE PROP FIFTY SIX WILL BE PROVIDE RATE INCREASES WILL BE POTENTIALLY SUNSET AT THAT SENDS A REALLY UNSETTLING MESSAGE TO THE PRIVATE AT THE THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY I THINK IT'S WRONG. THE GOVERNOR HAS THE ABILITY OR WE TO HAVE AN ABILITY THROUGH THE BUDGET PROCESS TO SUSPEND THOSE ADDED DATE SHOULD THE NEED ARISE. BUT TO HAVE TO GO BACK AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN CLAW BACK FOR THESE BENEFITS. DOCTORS AND DENTISTS AND OTHER PEOPLE WENT OUT. SPEND A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY. TO PUT THIS PROPOSITION ON THE BALLOT AND GET IT PASSED BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND ANOTHER RESOURCE. AND I UNDERSTAND THAT THE GOVERNOR OF LAST GOVERNOR FELT THAT THEY COULD TAKE SOME OF THIS MONEY AND USE IT AND AND THEY HAVE. AND IT APPEARS THAT THIS IS GOING TO HAPPEN WITH THIS NEW ADMINISTRATION HERE AS WELL. AND THERE'S NOT MUCH THERE'S NOT MUCH WE CAN DO ABOUT THAT I THINK WE ACCEPT THAT. BUT I THINK THE MESSAGE THAT SENT TO THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY THAT SOMEHOW WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT FOR THIS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN WHEN WE ALREADY KNOW THAT THE BUDGET PROCESS WE CAN MAKE THESE CUTS. I THINK IS IS GROSSLY UNFAIR. WE ARE TRYING TO GET MORE AND MORE PEOPLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE MEDICARE PROGRAM AND YOU CREATE THIS UNCERTAINTY OUT THERE. I'M SORRY THAT'S I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S PRODUCTIVE. IT WE'RE GONNA BE EXPANDING COVERAGE TO MORE AND MORE PEOPLE WE NEED A PROVIDER BASE THAT SOLID DEPENDABLE AND IS WILLING TO BE THERE WITH US FOR THE LONG RUN. THEY DON'T NEED UNCERTAINTY. AND THAT GOES FOR A LOT OF OTHERS AS WELL SO -- I JUST. I JUST FRUSTRATED BY THE BY THE MESSAGE I GET THAT WE WE LOOK AT PETITE FUTURE POTENTIAL. FISCAL UNCERTAINTY WE ALL DO. BUT THIS IS UNSETTLING THEY SAID YESTERDAY WE ASKED WE WERE ASKED. TO HIRING FOR FIFTEEN POSITIONS. OF FOR STATE GOVERNMENT OF THOSE FIFTEEN POSITIONS TOLD THAT YOUR YOUR JOB MIGHT BE SUNSET IT I DOUBT IT. BUT WE'RE TELLING OUR PROVIDER COMMUNITY THIS TAKING CARE SOME OF OUR MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE OUT THERE THAT THEY COULD BE SUNSET IT. SO -- I I OBJECT TO THE THE WAY THIS IS DONE AND I JUST I JUST THINK IT'S UNFORTUNATE THAT THIS IS SENDING THE WRONG MESSAGE IS. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD FRAZIER. TAKE I JUST WANT TO KIND OF IT. ADD ON TO THAT WHY WOULD ANYBODY WANT TO HELP ANYMORE WHY WOULD THEY WANT TO DO TAKEN DO WHAT YOU WANT WITH IT. I MEAN THANK GOD WITH SB ONE WEEK CONSTITUTIONALLY PROTECTED. WITH -- ME SEE A FIVE AND PROP -- SIXTY NINE AND AGAIN MY MEANS. IT WAS A CONCERTED EFFORT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND WE TOOK [inaudible] WE THE PROCESS TOOK ITS. NORMAL TOLL ON WHAT THE WHEN PEOPLE TRY TO HELP AND IT'S JUST AGENTS NEEDS TO STOP. OUR FINAL ON THE OTHER NOTE WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT THE TEAM INTERVENTION -- OF TRAINING. DO WE KNOW OF ALL THE FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES. EACH ACTUALLY EVEN HAVE CAPACITY FOR PEDIATRIC ROUTINE CRISIS BEDS. AS I KNOW SEVERAL MY COUNTIES DON'T. AND SO YOU KNOW I THINK WE HAVE TO IN PARALLEL FOR GONNA DO THE TRAINING WE HAVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE A A PLACE. TO HELP THESE CHILDREN. AND NOT PUTTING THEM IN SAVE. THIRTY HOSPITAL THEN JUVENILE HALL -- THAT'S ALL I HAVE IS ONE COUNTY -- SO I'M THINKING THAT YOU KNOW WAS GREAT HAVE AND I APPRECIATE THE THOUGHTFULNESS BUT IMPERIL WE NEED TO BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THAT HE CAN BE EFFECTIVE. AND ACTUALLY -- INSTEAD OF THROWING MONEY GOOD MONEY AFTER BAD. THAT THAT THE COUNTIES ARE ACTUALLY GOING TO BE ABLE TO ACCOMPLISH. I WILL -- WELL INTENTIONAL -- BUT I MEAN. WHY WOULD WE WILL GO AHEAD AND JUST START TRAINING PEOPLE AND AND PUTTING THINGS IF WE CAN ACTUALLY? WE DON'T HAVE THE CAPACITY. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER MR MATHIS. I'M GONNA GO THE SAME CONCERNS AS MY COLLEAGUES HERE. IN A HOME [inaudible] WE HAVE. A IN A SAID THIS LAST NIGHT. TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE FIVE BILLION DOLLAR SURPLUS. NOT TO MENTION THAT THE TWENTY BILLION PLUS SURPLUS FROM LAST YEAR. IN THE FACT THAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT SUNSETS. I MEAN I I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU ALL EXPECT TO RECRUIT PROVIDERS. TO DO THAT. BECAUSE IT'S YOUR TALENT -- MAY SET UP A BUSINESS MODEL THAT'S ONLY GONNA LAST FOR A FEW YEARS. A WHO WANTS TO INVEST IN THAT. AND THAT'S BEEN THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE. THE LARGEST PROBLEM WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA'S ACCESS. IN THAT MEANS ACCESS TO GET PROVIDERS TO PROVIDE THE SERVICES. SO OUR FAMILIES ARE STUCK WITH THESE HUGE WAIT TIMES ARE OR LIKE SOME OF US AND AND RURAL COUNTIES -- YOU KNOW. IT'S HOURS LONG DRIVE STEVEN GET IN IN YOUR YOUR HAVE A LONG TIME TO WAIT JUST TO DO THAT. IN ITS FAMILIES TAKING DAYS OFF WORK KIDS OUT OF SCHOOL TO BE ABLE TO DO THIS IN AND YOU WERE THE WHOLE PURPOSE IS TO GET MORE PROVIDERS TO INCREASE ACCESS SO. WHAT KIND OF SUSTAINABILITY ARE WE GONNA HAVE WITH THE SUNSETS AND AND AND I KNOW THE THE OLIGARCHY WITHIN THE GOVERNOR'S OFFICE IS ALREADY MADE THE DETERMINATIONS ON THIS SIDE. AND WE'VE SEEN THAT WITH THIS REVISED I JUST HOPE THAT -- MY COLLEAGUES AND I ALONG WITH OUR COLLEAGUES IN THE SENATE COULD PUT ENOUGH PRESSURE BACK ON THE ADMINISTRATION TO GET REALLY SUNSETS IS THIS TRAILER LANGUAGE COMES UP NEXT WEEK. BECAUSE THIS THIS ISN'T GOING TO WORK WE ALL KNOW IT'S NOT GOING TO WORK AND IT'S NOT GOING TO PROVIDE THE SUSTAINABILITY THAT WE NEED. SO IF LA -- IF YOU GUYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO GET US SOME TRAILER LANGUAGE ACTUALLY FIX THAT OCCUR THE SUNSET SO WE CAN ACTUALLY PROVIDE CERTAINTY I'D LOVE TO SEE [inaudible] THANK YOU. I THINK IT DOES BEG THE QUESTION. WHY IS THERE A PROPOSED THREE YEAR SUNSET GIVEN THAT THESE ARE SPECIAL FUNDS? FOR THIS PURPOSE. WELL ABOVE MEDICARE'S DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- SO OVER THE MULTI YEAR THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD WE ARE PROJECTING A REVENUE DEFICIT -- IN THE OUT YEARS AND PROP FIFTY SIX HAS BEEN USED TO FUND MEDI CAL GROWTH -- IN THE PAST AND SO. ARE OUR MULTI YEAR FORECAST ASSUME THAT IN -- BUDGET BUT DEAR TO HIM BUT DO YOUR THREE WE WILL BE USING PROP FIFTY SIX FUNDS TO FUND MEDI CAL PROGRAM GROWTH. AND SO THE YOU KNOW THE GOVERNOR -- HAS EXPRESSED -- DESIRE TO PRESENT A BALANCED BUDGET -- WITHOUT -- IF THIS IS AN APPROVED THERE WILL BE REDUCTIONS ELSEWHERE IN THE BUDGET AND SO IT'S ALL ABOUT ABOUT A BALANCING ACT. THE RESOURCES -- THAT WE TALK TALK ABOUT IN THE OUT YEARS AND YET LAST NIGHT. WE'RE NOT GOING TO REPEAT ALL OF OUR DISCUSSION FROM LAST NIGHT IT WAS A VERY LONG MEETING BUT IF WE'RE TALKING ABOUT THE FACT THAT IN THE OUT YEARS WE MAY HAVE. LESS RESOURCES WE KNOW THAT'S ALWAYS A POSSIBILITY IS DOCTOR WOULD IS IT HAS SAID WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO THEN COME TOGETHER IN THE BUDGET. AND REDUCE OR OR ELIMINATE WHATEVER NEEDS TO BE DONE. BUT THE STABILITY THAT IS NEEDED FOR THE PROVIDERS AND FOR THOSE DATES THE SERVICE EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. AND I THINK THAT. WE HOPE THAT THAT IS THE MESSAGE THAT YOU ARE HEARING. NOT JUST HERE BUT YET IT IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT WE DON'T SET A PRECEDENT THAT DURING THE THE THE YEARS WHEN WE DO HAVE A SURPLUS. THAT IN THOSE YEARS WE ARE STILL NOT PROVIDING THE STABILITY THAT THAT IS NEEDED IN A PROGRAM SUCH AS THIS. AND WE UNDER WE UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERNS -- AND DO WANT TO SAY THAT THE ADMINISTRATION -- IS COMMITTED -- TO LONG TERM -- CHANGES AND AND THE HEALTH -- UNIVERSE AND SO I DID DID ONE EXPRESSED A COMMITMENT FROM THE GOVERNOR SO THERE ARE SORT OF A LONG TERM PLAN -- TO MAKE CHANGES AND IN THE HEALTH SYSTEM THANK YOU. YES DOCTOR WOULD. ARE JUST JUST ANOTHER ANOTHER COMMENT I THINK I THINK I'VE MADE MY POINT THAT. IT'S A MESSAGING THAT THAT THAT BOTHERS ME AND AND AND AND IT FEELS LIKE WE'RE NOT VALUING OUR PROVIDERS WHEN WE TELL THEM THAT. YOU KNOW YOU'RE YOU'RE UP FOR A SUNSET YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO FIGHT THEM FOR THAT. I WOULD SAY I WILL POINT OUT AND I'M THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME I POINTED OUT WE HAVE A A UPS POTENTIAL BIG SOURCE OF REVENUE THAT ISN'T CURRENTLY ON THE TABLE RIGHT NOW THAT'S THE MCO TAX. WOULD WHICH WOULD BE BECAUSE OF BETWEEN ONE POINT FIVE ONE POINT EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. AND A BUNCH OF THAT IS FEDERAL MONEY. AND SO. YOU WANT STABILITY OUT THERE -- I WOULD ENCOURAGE THE ADMINISTRATION TO LOOK SERIOUSLY GOING AND GOING AFTER THAT RESOURCE A RENEWAL OF SOMETHING THAT'S BEEN IN PLACE FOR FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW [inaudible] VERY GOOD. THANK YOU MEMBERS OF THANK YOU TO THE PANELISTS. ISSUE NUMBER SIX WILL BE DIVIDED INTO TWO ISSUES ISSUE. SIX EIGHTY WILL BE THE TOP PORTION.% OF PAGE. TWENTY FIVE MEDI CAL ELIGIBILITY EXPANSION UPDATES. AND WITH. ISSUE SIX BE WILL BE THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE NOTED AT THE BOTTOM OF THE PAGE [inaudible] PLEASE BEGIN. I'M SO GIVE A AN UPDATE ON THE MEDICAID EXPANSION TO UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULTS NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE AS PRESENTED IN THE MAY REVIEW REVISION. THERE ARE TWO MAIN CHANGES THAT YOU'LL SEE IN THIS PORTION THE FIRST ONE BEING THE PROPOSED IMPLEMENTATION DATE -- NOW BEING PROPOSES JANUARY -- ONE TWENTY TWENTY THE REASON WHY WE ARE PER PROPOSING THIS REVISED IMPLEMENTATION DAYS TO ENSURE THAT OUR SYSTEMS ARE READY FOR THE TRANSITION. IF YOU HAVE PROPER COMMUNICATION OUT TO THE BENEFICIARIES -- AND TO ENSURE THAT EVERYBODY INCLUDING OUR COUNTIES ARE READY TO TRANSITION SUCCESSFULLY WE DID LEARN FROM THE PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION AND SO WE DO HAVE SOME EXPERIENCE IN INFORMATION ABOUT -- HOW LONG IT TAKES TO PREPARE SYSTEMS -- AND TO COMMUNICATE EFFECTIVELY TO INDIVIDUALS ABOUT THE CHANGE -- SO THAT'S THE THE FIRST CHANGE THE SECOND CHANGE IS GOING TO BE THE REVISED ESTIMATE OF THE COVERED BUYS WHICH YOU'LL SEE AN ADJUSTMENT SLIGHTLY -- TO WHAT WE ARE PROPOSING AS AN ESTIMATED TO EXTEND FULL SO COVERAGE TO NINETY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS SEVENTY FOR A 75% OF THOSE INDIVIDUALS WOULD BE TRANSITIONING FROM CURRENT RESTRICTED SCOPE TO FULL SCOPE. AND THE OTHERS WOULD TRANSITION AS A PHASED IN -- OVER A TWELVE MONTH PERIOD. THAT IS ALL MY COMMENTS AT THIS TIME. THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS. LORI L. AT DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE AS MY COLLEAGUE FROM THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES STATED THE MAY REVISION ASSUMES A SIX MONTH -- SHIFTED IMPLEMENTATION AND ALSO -- ONE HUNDRED TWENTY TWO MILLION DECREASING COSTS AND 80% OF THE DECREASING COSTS THAT IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIX MONTH SHIFT. THE OTHER 20% IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECREASE ENROLLMENT AND THE DECREASE IN ROME IS BASED ON THE LATEST AVAILABLE DATA -- ON UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE AS YOU MAY RECALL RESEARCHER FROM THE UC BERKELEY LABOR CENTER PRESENTED. A FEBRUARY TWENTY NINETEEN REPORT WHICH STATES -- THAT THE TRENDS OF UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE HAVE BEEN -- DECREASING SINCE -- TWO THOUSAND SEVEN AND THE REVISED PROJECT ENROLLMENT OF NINETEEN TO TWENTY FIVE YEAR OLDS IS A HUNDRED AND FOUR THOUSAND THE NINETY THOUSAND THAT MY COLLEAGUES STATED. IS -- PART OF THE PHASE IN IN THE FIRST YEAR AND OF THE REMAINING INDIVIDUALS WE WOULD EXPECT WOULD PHASE IN OVER. AND THE NEXT SIX MONTHS AND IN THE IN BUDGET YEAR PLUS. ONE THE ADDITIONALLY THE DECREASE -- IS CONSISTENT THE TREND OF DECREASING UNDOCUMENTED UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS IN THE STATE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE DIFFERENT HEALTH CARE SERVICES TWENTY EIGHTEEN DATA THAT LATELY LATEST DATA USED IN. THIS UPDATED ESTIMATE THAT SHOWS THAT THE NUMBER OF RESTRICTED SCOPE INDIVIDUALS ENROLLED IN MEDICARE AL HAS BEEN DECREASING SINCE SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN AS WELL AS THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN ROLL THROUGH SB. SEVENTY FIVE THAT PEAK WAS -- IN APRIL TWENTY SEVENTEEN AND IT HAS BEEN INCREASING SINCE THEN ADDITIONALLY THE TOTAL MEDI CAL CASELOAD HAS BEEN DECREASING TO SIXTEEN SEVENTEEN SO WE FEEL THAT THE ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS TO BE A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN ELIGIBLE. IS A REASONABLE AND CONSISTENT WITH ALL THE RESEARCH THAT WERE SAYING. THANK YOU HELLO -- BEN JOHNSON WITH THE LA -- WE DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERNS WITH THE SHIFT IN THE IMPLEMENTATION DATE -- TO HALF YEAR JUST NOTING THAT THERE ARE -- PROCESS SEES THAT THE DEPARTMENT DOES HAVE TO UNDERTAKE TO AFFECT THAT TRANSITION -- AND THEN ON CASELOAD -- WE ARE WORKING AND CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION HAVE BEEN REALLY PROACTIVE IN PROVIDING US REALLY GOOD INFORMATION TO JUST UNDERSTAND A LITTLE BIT MORE ABOUT -- THE CASELOAD DECLINE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM OVER THE COMING DAYS BUT DON'T HAVE ANY REAL CONCERNS THERE -- JUST GUESS I'D NOTE THAT THAT ACCORDING TO OUR ESTIMATES THAT DOES -- THAT WOULD REDUCE OUR PROJECTIONS OF ON GOING GENERAL FUND COSTS BY ABOUT EIGHTY MILLION COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAD IN JANUARY [inaudible] THANK YOU. LET'S OPEN IT UP TO PUBLIC COMMENT. GOOD MORNING TURN MEMBERS DEEPLY ACNE SHOW WITH THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER -- WE ARE IN SUPPORT OF ITEMS SI EIGHT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSING -- AN INITIAL LIKE EXPANSION THAT WE ARE APPRECIATIVE OF ON OUR PATHWAY TO GET TO UNIVERSAL COVERAGE HOWEVER -- WE WOULD ASK THAT THE COMMITTEE CONTINUES TO CONSIDER HOW TO ACHIEVE -- A FULL EXPANSION OF THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION ARMED AND ESPECIALLY FOR THIS YEAR OUR COMMUNITY IS I REALLY INVESTED IN ENSURING THAT SENIORS ARE COVERED BECAUSE OUR SENIOR CENTER COMMUNITY.

LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE SAP PROPOSAL I DO AGREE WITH THE DELAY IN TIMELINE BASED ON A PREVIOUS IMPLEMENTATION EFFORTS AND SO IT'S YOU KNOW ISSUE THERE. ARE SIMILARLY CONSIDERING THE THE DECLINES IN REVENUES WOULD URGE THE LEGISLATURE CONSIDER -- EXPANDING BEYOND A YOUNG ADULTS -- AND AS OF THE CALIFORNIA IMMIGRANT POLICY CENTER HAS STATED I THE COMMUNITY HAS PRIORITIZED SENIORS INDIVIDUAL SIXTY FIVE AND OLDER SO DO YOU AGREE WITH THAT THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING RANDALL COMING HERE BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY HERE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL TO EXPAND MEDICARE OUT TO YOUNG ADULTS IN THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY CERTAINLY WE DO THINK THAT THIS IS THE YEAR FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE IT A STEP FURTHER -- BUT WE DO BELIEVE AT THIS TIME BASED ON WHAT WE'VE HEARD FROM THE COMMUNITY THAT WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING ON THE SENIORS POPULATION IT IS ABOUT THIRTY THOUSAND PEOPLE 2% OF THE ENTIRE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION. IT IS A NINETY FOUR MILLION BASE BECAUSE IN THE MEDI CAL PROGRAM AND WE ARE READY -- PAYING FOR THE COST OF THESE INDIVIDUALS AND LONG TERM CARE AND NURSING HOME SO WE DO THINK THAT IT SHOULD BE A PRIORITY THIS YEAR TO BUILD ON THE GOVERNOR'S YOUNG ADULT PROPOSAL AND INCLUDE SENIORS AS BOOKENDS OF LIFE. AND ALSO -- WORK TOWARDS A COMMITMENT TO PHASE IN THE POPULATION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF YEARS TO GET TO ALL WE CERTAINLY AGREE WITH THE GOVERNOR ON LOOKING AT WAYS -- TO HAVE AN INCREMENTAL STRATEGY TO GET TO UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND WE DO BELIEVE THAT THIS YEAR WE CAN MOVE YOUNG ADULTS AND WE CAN BUILD -- WITH SENIORS AND GET BACK COMMITMENT TO ALL TO PHASE IN THE POPULATION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS KATHY SETTLING FOR THE COUNTY WELFARE DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION WE ALSO SUPPORT THE EXPANSION AND ITEM SIX A AND ONE ASSOCIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH OUR COLLEAGUES THAT WE SUPPORT A BROADER EXPANSIONIST WHILE.

JUST WANNA SAY I'M SUPPORT SUPPORT THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL -- HI I WOULD LIKE TO SAY THAT I ALSO CONTINUE TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT OUR PROVIDER NETWORK AS WEAK AS WE EXPAND COVERAGE. IT'S IMPORTANT WE HAVE A STABLE PROVIDER NETWORK AND GOES BACK TO THE COMMENT SOME ON THE PRE FROM THE PREVIOUS ITEM THERE -- AND WOULD LOVE TO SEE THIS EXTENDED TO SENIORS -- AS WELL. I WILL POINT OUT THOUGH -- JUST IN GENERAL -- WITH THE OVERALL SENIOR POPULATION THAT THE BUDGET -- DIDN'T REALLY INVEST IN THE SENIORS --AND THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN TO ME. I'M NOT SEEN SEEN SEEN HERE WE HEARD UP A QUITE A FEW REQUESTS. OF FROM -- AGENCIES -- PROGRAMS THAT HAVEN'T HAD THE THE RECESSION CUTS RESTORED. SO MY FEAR IS AS WE AS WE EXPAND TO A LARGER AND LARGER POPULATION ARE WE EXPANDING -- CARE WERE WE ACTUALLY EXPANDING A CARD THAT SAYS YOU HAVE COVERAGE BECAUSE WE HAVE ALL THESE PROGRAMS THAT ARE STRUGGLING -- TO PROVIDE SERVICES YET WE'RE GOING TO CONTINUE TO ADD ON TO THAT. NOW GO BACK TO ONCE AGAIN -- THERE IS A POTENTIAL SOURCE OF REVENUE OUT THERE THAT COULD HELP US WITH THAT. AND I HOPE THAT HOPE THAT THAT'S MORE THAT SERIOUSLY EXPLORED. THANK YOU DOCTOR WOULD STE MATHIS. HELLO MISTER WAS I THINK WE'RE ON THE SAME PAGE ON A LOT OF THIS -- YEAH MY MY DISTRICT IS A HIGHLY. VERY LARGE IMMIGRANT POPULATION OF MY DISTRICT AND I I WANNA SEE EVERYBODY GET COVERED A REALLY DETAILED. BUT AT THE SAME TIME. AS WERE DEALING WITH BUDGET PRIORITIES I I'VE GOT TO ASK. YOU KNOW LAST NIGHT WE SPENT TIME TALKING ABOUT YOU KNOW WE CAN'T GO TO THE 8%. THE RATE STUDY FOR THE DISABLED POPULATION AND NOT GETTING THE FULLY FUND AND THERE. WERE NOT GOOD ENOUGH FULLY FUNDING FOR OUR YOUTH FOR DENTAL AND OPTOMETRY. AS DR WHICH IS STATED WERE NOT DOING ENOUGH TO INCREASE OUR PROVIDERS WHICH IS THE TRUE PROBLEM. WITH ACCESS AND WE'RE NOT DOING ENOUGH FOR OUR ELDERLY. AND NOW WE'RE GOING TO BRING IN UNDOCUMENTED POPULATION INTO THAT. IN THE HIGHER DEMAND WITH OUT. ACTUALLY DOING WHAT WE ALL KNOW NEEDS TO HAPPEN IN INCREASE OUR PROVIDER SITUATION. BECAUSE I ALREADY HAVE A SITUATION. IN MY DISTRICT WHERE IT TAKES THREE TO FOUR WEEKS TO SEE A PROVIDER. THREE TO FOUR WEEKS. AND THIS IS ANYONE TALKING SPECIALTIES SPECIALTIES ARE ARE MONTHS OUT. IN ANY AREA REFERRED. SOMEWHERE THAT'S A THREE FOUR HOUR DRIVE AWAY [inaudible] SHELL. I I'VE GAS. YOU KNOW WE HAVE THIS IDEA IN IN IN THE TALKING POINTS ARE GREAT IT'S FANTASTIC TO SAY HEY EVERYBODY'S GOING TO GET A HEALTH CARE INSURANCE CARD IT'S GREAT. THE IT IT'S LIKE GIVING EVERYBODY A DRIVER'S LICENSE AND DRIVER'S INSURANCE BUT NOT A CAR. WE NEED THE PROVIDERS. WE WE NEED TO STOP BOGGING DOWN OUR SYSTEM. THE INSANE IN THE HIGHER EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET AN INSURANCE CARD. pIT'S LIKE THE GOVERNOR THINKS HE'S OPRAH OR SOMETHING AND IT'S YOU GET CARDED A CARDIO GET INSURANCE AND EVERYTHING'S GONNA BE GREAT. WE DON'T HAVE THE DOCTORS. WE DON'T HAVE THE CLINICS THE IT'S NOT THERE. AND WE CAN KEEP THROWING ALL THE MONEY AWAY. BUT I MEAN WE SEE HERE WITH THIS CRAZY HUGE SURPLUS IN A GOOD YEAR. AND THE WE SIT HERE LISTENING TO THE SAME ARGUMENTS. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT YEARS AGO WITH PROP FIFTY SIX THAT WAS DESIGNED FOR MORE PROVIDERS. BUT YET. YOU KNOW JUST BECAUSE GOVERNOR BROWN SIR PLANTED THE FUNDING TO FILL THE HOLES. SO WE'RE GOING TO DO IT AGAIN AND WE'RE GONNA KEEP DOING THAT AND IS THE THE DOCTOR WOODS. MENTION YOU KNOW WE FOUGHT REALLY HARD ON THE MCO. A FEW YEARS AGO. AND THERE'S NO MENTION OF THAT. SO REALLY WHAT WHAT ARE WE DOING. BECAUSE THESE ARE THE QUESTIONS ALL OF US MEMBERS OF YOUR ON THE DICE ARE GONNA GET ASKED WHEN WE GO BACK HOME. AND OUR PARENTS CAN'T GET IN TO SEE THEIR DOCTORS NORMALLY GET SENT SOMEWHERE ELSE. THE QUESTIONS I GET ASKED EVERY DAY. WELL HOW HOW COME WE'RE TALKING ABOUT UNDOCK SUCK WERE TALKING ABOUT THIS WHEN I CAN'T EVEN GET IN TO SEE A DOCTOR. SO SO HOW DO YOU EXPECT US TO ANSWER THAT TO OUR FOLKS BACK HOME. BECAUSE I I MEAN I I WANT TO SEE EVERYBODY BE ABLE TO HAVE ACCESS I WANNA SEE EVERYBODY WHETHER A DOCUMENT OR NOT. BE ABLE TO MAKE SURE THEIR FAMILIES HEALTHY AND DOING WELL. BUT WE'VE GOT AN ANSWER BACK TO OUR PUBLIC. AND RIGHT NOW IT'S A FANTASY OF EVERYBODY'S GONNA GET COVERED HEALTH CARE FOR ALL. WITH THE ZERO ACCESS. BECAUSE NOBODY HAS THE ABILITY TO GET IN. SO HOW ARE WE GONNA FIX THAT. QUESTION OR MADAM CHAIR I'D LOVE AN ANSWER BUT I'M NOT SEEN IT IN HIS BUDGET. ALL RIGHT WILSON WITH A RHETORICAL QUESTION. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK ON THIS ITEM. OF THAT IS OF GREAT IMPERSONAL IMPORTANCE TO ME AS MANY OF YOU WATCHING YOUR TODAY I KNOW THAT MY SIBLINGS AND I WERE UNDOCUMENTED AT ONE POINT IN OUR LIVES -- WE DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE WHEN WE CAME TO THIS COUNTRY AND I KNOW FIRST HAND WHAT ARE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITIES GOING THROUGH. I WOULD LIKE TO APPLY GOVERNOR NEW SOME FOR THIS ITEM IN MAKING AND TAKING CARE OF OUR YOUNG ADULTS UP TO AGE. TWENTY SIX HOWEVER I WOULD ALSO LIKE TO SPEAK UP AND PUT FORWARD THAT THIS CAN COMMITTEE AND THE ADMINISTRATION CONSIDER LOOKING AT THE SENIORS. IN THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY AGE -- SIXTY FIVE AND UP SPECIFIC SPECIFICALLY WHEN IT BECAUSE COMES TO MEDI CAL AND ARE YOU TAKE I. H. S. S.. ELIGIBILITY AS WE KNOW LATER IN LIFE IS WHEN A LOT OF THE HEALTH ISSUES BEGAN AND THAT'S WHERE THE GREATEST SIX I THINK -- ARE A LOT OF OUR SENIORS ARE GOING TO THE URGENT CARE EMERGENCY ROOMS AND WE'RE PAYING FOR THOSE ANYWAY AND I THINK THE OLDER POPULATION I NEEDS. HELP RIGHT NOW AND I'M HOPING THAT THE GOVERNOR AND THE COMMITTEE CAN HAVE A CONVERSATION ABOUT THAT. THANK YOU. THANK YOU MS REVIEW THANK YOU FOR SHARING YOUR PERSONAL STORY. MR FRAZIER THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR CAN SOMEBODY ON THE PANEL TALK TO ME ABOUT SEE AN SP. AND THE TO THE NEXT ISSUE IS IT YES OKAY FOCUS WAS PART OF THIS ALSO. IT IT'S WE'VE WE'VE DIVIDED IT OKAY. A WAY TO LIVE. UNLESS SOMEBODY FROM THE PANEL WANTS TO TALK ABOUT HERE. YEAH BUT I I WANTED TO JUST SAY REALLY QUICKLY ON THE WORK FORCE I KNOW THAT -- YOU HEARD IT ON THE OFFICE PEGGED -- ITEM PREVIOUS TO THIS AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING THAT'S INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION AROUND. THE CAL HEALTH CARE'S WHICH IS OUR LOAN REPAYMENT THAT WHERE YOU'RE USING THE PROPOSITION FIFTY SIX FUNDS -- FOR I THINK THAT THIS IS A REALLY. EXCITING TIME AN AREA FOR US ON THE APPLICATIONS -- FOR THOSE AS IN -- INDIVIDUALS CLOSED A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO -- WE RECEIVED OVER TWELVE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FROM BOTH PHYSICIANS AND DENTISTS APPROXIMATELY NINE HUNDRED APPLICATIONS FOR PHYSICIANS APPROXIMATELY TWO HUNDRED FOR A DENTIST -- IN EXCHANGE FOR US -- PAIN FOR UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS AN EDUCATIONAL DEBT -- THEY WILL COMMIT TO A FIVE YEAR -- TERM OF SERVICE IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM THEY WILL SEE AT LEAST A THIRD OF THEIR PATIENT CASE LOAD WILL BE AND MEDI CAL -- I THINK WHAT WE WERE TRYING VERY MUCH TO DO IS -- CERTAINLY NEED SOME OF YOUR INTEREST IN THIS AREA WE ARE -- PROVIDER AGNOSTIC IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY WORK WE ARE LOCATION AGNOSTIC IN TERMS OF WHERE THEY ARE -- I THINK WHAT WE ALSO INDICATED AS WE WANTED TO GIVE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION TO PROVIDERS THAT TOOK A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF MEDI CAL -- AS PART OF THEIR PATIENT CASELOAD AND CERTAINLY -- FOR SPEAKING ADDITIONAL LANGUAGES AND OR BEING A SPECIALTY THAT IS PARTICULARLY HARD FOR US TO RECRUIT IN THE MEDICAL PROGRAM SUCH AS CHILD PSYCHIATRY -- WHICH IS MY PERSONAL -- ONE THAT I MIGHT IF I CAN FIND A CHILD PSYCHIATRIST I WILL. WHEREVER THEY ARE WE WILL WE WILL FIND THEM -- SO I JUST I WANT TO SAY THAT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED ABOUT THE RESPONSE -- FROM THE PROVIDER COMMUNITY FOR THE APPLICATION OF THOSE FUNDS AS WELL AS WE INTEND TO BE AWARDING THAT FIRST. ROUND OF GRANTS TO PROVIDERS AT THE END OF THIS FISCAL YEAR -- SO MORE ON THAT BUT CERTAINLY -- APPRECIATING AND WANTING -- TO EMPATHIZE ABOUT THE NEED TO CONTINUE TO GROW THE WORK FIRST AND KEEP THOSE MEDICAL STUDENTS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA RATHER THAN GOING ELSEWHERE TO PRACTICE. YES DOCTOR WOULD. I'M JUST CURIOUS IF HAVE YOU WITH THE GARCIA REPORT TO BE CONSIDERED -- THOSE SAME KINDS OF PROGRAMS FORCING NURSE PRACTITIONERS PHYSICIAN'S ASSISTANTS. NURSES BECAUSE YOU OBVIOUSLY WE NEED THE DENTISTS AND WE NEED THE POSITIONS BUT WE ALSO NEED THOSE AS WELL AND WE NEED THEM IN AREAS WHERE WE HAVE SHORTAGE AREAS MY ENTIRE DISTRICT IS A IS A IS A HEALTH MANPOWER SHORTAGE. AND SO I I THAT'S THE WORLD THAT THAT THA I LIVE IN BUT HAS HAD CONSIDERED GOING BEYOND THAT BECAUSE HE HAD DOCTORS DON'T WORK WELL WITHOUT NURSES AND AND AND ALL THESE OTHERS AND AND WHILE WE'RE MAKING THAT INVESTMENT. CAN WE MAKE THE INVESTMENT ON A BROADER ON A LITTLE BROADER BASIS YEAH I THINK THAT PART OF THE CONSIDERATION AND CERTAINLY THAT HAS BEEN RECESSED ABOUT USING THE LOAN -- FUNDS FOR DIFFERENT TYPES OF PROVIDERS I THINK JUST EVEN BASED ON THE OVERWHELMING. RESPONSE FROM THOSE TWO PROVIDER TYPES -- IT WOULD BE IN SOME CASES -- A DIFFERENT DISCUSSION TO TALK ABOUT YOU KNOW IF YOU WANT TO COVER MORE PEOPLE OR DIFFERENT TO PROVIDER TYPES YOU LOWER THE DOLLAR AMOUNT SO THAT YOU CAN TRY TO INCREASE YOU KNOW THERE'S THERE'S ALWAYS THAT BALANCE I THINK THE OTHER THING THAT I THINK ABOUT. IS THERE ARE OTHER LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS THAT WITH -- ADDITIONAL INDIVIDUALS BEING SO YOU CAN'T BE ELIGIBLE FOR OUR LOAN REPAYMENT AND ALSO GET LOAN REPAYMENT FROM DIFFERENT PLACES AND SOME IN SOME CASES WE WILL BE RELIEVING.% AND OR ALLOWING FOR GREATER CAPACITY FOR OTHER PROVIDERS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR LOANS WHERE THEY WERE COMPETING AGAINST OTHER PROVIDERS AND I THINK IF THERE ARE. CHANGES THAT NEED TO BE MADE IN OTHER TYPES OF LOAN REPAYMENT IN CALIFORNIA THROUGH EITHER OFSHE BETTER OTHERWISE -- TO INCREASE THE ABILITY FOR PEOPLE TO COMPETE I THINK WHAT WE WERE TRYING TO DO IS CERTAINLY ALLOW FOR AN A LARGER NUMBER OF APPLICANTS ACROSS PROVIDER TYPES TO HAVE MORE OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE THAT KIND OF THAT. INCENTIVE TO PROVIDE CARE. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER. THANK YOU I JUST THIS IS KIND OF A COINCIDENCE I JUST RAN INTO A YOUNG LADY WHO IS A CLINICAL PSYCHOLOGIST GOING FOR SOCIETY. AND SHE SHARED WITH ME HER LOANS. RIGHT NOW TO DATE JUST TO HAVE A MASTER SHE HAS 200-900-0300 TWENTY THREE THOUSAND IN PRINCIPLE. TWENTY THOUSAND AND FOURTEEN DOLLARS IN. INTEREST AND THEN SHE HAD TWELVE THOUSAND SIX HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE DOLLARS AND PELL GRANTS. AND SHE STILL HAS TO OFFER SO ID. WHY WOULD SHE? IF YOU CAN'T GET RELIEF. CHRIS CAN MAKE THIS UP I MEAN WITH THE COST OF LIVING AND EVERYTHING LIKE THAT SO. I MEAN. WE'RE TRYING TO GIVE CRITICAL CAREER PATHS -- TO BE HONEST WITH YOU SHE ENTERED INTO THE ARMY BECAUSE SHE CAN'T AFFORD TO GET OUR SIDE YOU SHE JUST CAN'T TAKE MORE DEBT. WITHOUT A REAL BILL YOU TO KNOW THAT THERE IS SOME KIND OF RELIEF AND THAT SHE CAN ACTUALLY APPLY HER CRAFT. I THINK ARE MAKING IT VERY ONEROUS FOR THESE INDIVIDUALS TO BE ABLE TO TREAT THE INDIVIDUALS THAT. YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF I MEAN I THINK WE FEEL VERY STRONGLY ABOUT THE LOAN REPAYMENT THAT WE HAVE INITIATED -- FROM THE STANDPOINT THAT WE WILL BE ESSENTIALLY WITH UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS WHICH IS A IS A REALLY -- EXTENSIVE AMOUNT OF LOAN REPAYMENT FOR PROVIDERS -- IN OUR THINKING IT WAS TO CHANGE THE ECONOMIC DECISION AROUND WHERE PROVIDERS. PRACTICE WHEN THEY GRADUATE -- BECAUSE IF YOU ARE A GRADUATE WITHOUT MUCH DEBT PLUS YOU'RE TRYING TO BUY A HOUSE OR START A FAMILY OR DO ALL THE OTHER THINGS THAT SUCH A CHALLENGE THAT YOU WOULD BE -- HARD PRESSED TO TAKE A JOB IN EITHER UNDERSERVED AREA OR IN A SAFETY NET. PROVIDER TYPE OF CAPACITY I THINK WE'RE TRYING TO FUNDAMENTALLY CHANGE THE ECONOMIC DECISIONS THAT INDIVIDUALS MAKE AND I THINK THAT'S WHAT IS SO EXCITING ABOUT THE ABOUT THE PROGRAM AND AND REALLY LOOKING FORWARD TO THE KIND OF LONG RANGE -- AND IN VETTING OF PROVIDERS IN CERTAIN PARTS OF THE STATE THAT THEY OTHERWISE WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO PRACTICE IT. SO JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY. WHAT WITH THEIR INCOME LEVEL BE DIMINISHED BY TAKING THIS DEAL -- RATHER THAN IF THEY WENT INTO THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND AND STARTED OFF I MEAN. I MEAN ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO BUY A HOUSE OF THOSE FIVE YEARS ARE THEY GOING TO BE ABLE TO OR YOU KNOW. WHAT'S THE DIFFERENTIAL. I MEAN I WANT TO KNOW BECAUSE YOU'RE OFFERING UP TO THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND BUT ARE THEY MAKING FIFTY THOUSAND DOLLARS YEAR. AS A CLINICIAN. I DON'T. KNOW BUT I DON'T KNOW THAT ANY PHYSICIAN OR DENTIST IS MAKING THAT. LOW OF AN AMOUNT I THINK AND YOU KNOW. I'M LOOKING AT DOCTOR WOULD IN SOME OF HIS AREA WHERE HE HAS -- NOT BECAUSE IF YOU PERSONALLY AS A PROVIDER BUT BUT FROM A FROM A LIKE A YOU KNOW A FEDERALLY QUALIFIED HEALTH CENTER YOU KNOW I I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE AVERAGE PHYSICIAN SALARY IS OR WHAT AN AVERAGE DENTIST AND PRACTICES BUT THEY'RE CERTAINLY. IF YOU DON'T HAVE TO PAY YOUR DEBT AT ALL BECAUSE WE HAVE ESSENTIALLY TAKING CARE OF IT YOUR SENSUALLY YOU HAVE A SALARY AS A PROFESSIONAL MEDICAL -- CLINICIAN THAT WILL CHANGE THE NATURE OF WHAT YOU'RE ABLE TO DO AS OPPOSED TO HAVING TO JUGGLE YOUR PERSONAL OBLIGATIONS PLEASURE DEBT WE JUST NOTICED SOME INDIVIDUALS. WILL NOT TAKE MEDI CAL BECAUSE OF THE REIMBURSEMENT RATE IS SO LOW. IS WHAT I'M SAYING IS. WHAT DEAL ARE THEY MAKING? IF THEY'RE TAKING. THIS TO GET THIS. THAT'S WHAT I'M SAYING HOW DOES IT I MEAN. HEY HOW'S IT GOING. YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE TO I'VE I AM I DON'T I NEVER I NEVER HAD THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS WORTH OF STUDENT DEBT BUT I CAN CERTAINLY YOU KNOW WE CAN CERTAINLY CHECK AND SAY WHAT IS. DEBT REPAYMENT LOOK LIKE IN TERMS OF WHAT DO YOU A EXPECTED TO PAY BACK WHEN YOU HAVE THAT MUCH. STUDENT DEBT AND THAT JUST KIND OF CALCULATES INTO WHAT YOUR ANNUAL SALARY HAS TO BE IN ORDER TO HELP MAKE YOUR BOTH DEBT PAYMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER PERSONAL OBLIGATIONS SUCH AS YOU KNOW RENTER HOUSING OR THINGS LIKE THAT. THANK YOU MISTER FRAZIER JUST ONE BRIEF COMMENT AT THESE A LOT OF PEOPLE BE THRILLED TO HAVE JUST THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS IN DEBT BECAUSE THAT NUMBER IS. QUICKLY BECOMING A FLOOR IN A LOT OF PROFESSIONS SO AND THAT'S A PRETTY STAGGERING THAT'S A PRETTY STAGGERING. CHALLENGE OF PEOPLE ARE FACING. I THINK IT'S ABUNDANTLY CLEAR FROM COMMENTS FROM EVERYBODY HERE THE DICE THAT. THERE IS GREAT CONCERN FOR ACCESS. HELLO. AND I I WOULD VENTURE TO SAY THAT. WE DON'T GET A LICENSE WE DO GET A CARDS JUST WE'VE GOT TO GET THE ROAD. BUT WE DO GET A CAR. SO WHAT WE DO HAVE THE ACCESS THAT WE DO HAVE OUR COVERAGE BUT WE DO HAVE TO BE SURE THAT THERE IS ACCESS. AND I APPRECIATE ALL OF THE PROGRAMS THAT ARE BEING OFFERED UP AND TO THE THE BUDGETARY ITEMS THAT ARE BEING INCLUDED. BUT WITHOUT A DOUBT IT STILL IS A SERIOUS ISSUE AS YOU CAN NOTE FROM ALL THE MEMBERS HERE. MADAM CHAIR WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THOSE ROADS WE'RE STILL WORKING ON THOSE ROADS THAT'S RIGHT. THANK YOU SO MUCH. THAT CONCLUDES ISSUE. SIX EIGHTY LET'S GO TO SEE ISSUE SIX BE. THE TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE CHAIRS GOING TO STEP OUT SHE ASKED ME TO TAKE OVER -- WE'RE GONNA GO UNTIL NOON AND THEN WE'LL BREAK UNTIL. ONE THIRTY SO. PLEASE A ISSUE -- SEVEN OR SIX FOUR SIX FOUR SIX PM SORRY. SIX BE IT IS. THE MORNING MEMBERS JENNY WHEN DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE NEIGHBOR VISION A SEEMS GENERAL FUND SAVINGS OF FORTY THREE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS IN THE COW WORKS PROGRAM. AND MAKE SEVERAL CHANGES TO THE MINISTRATIONS PROPOSAL FOR A BI. EIGHTY FIVE FIRST NOTING COUNTIES CONCERNS ON THE DECREASE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH SERVICES. THAT MAY REVISION WILL NO LONGER pFOR THE FOR COUNTIES REALIGNMENT ROBIN IS 275%. SECOND THE NAY REVISION REFLECTS YOLO COUNTY AT THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM COUNTY. AND LASTLY THE THE NEIGHBOR VISION PROPOSES TO WITHHOLD REALIGNMENT REVENUES FROM THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES PROGRAM BOARD. UNTIL THE BOARD'S TOTAL RESERVES REACH A REASONABLE LEVEL EQUAL TO TWO YEARS WORTH OF TOTAL EXPENDITURES. AT THAT POINT THE BOARD'S REDIRECTION WILL BEREFLECTED THAT 75%. NEXT RYAN WAS THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE JUST A FEW COMMENTS ON THIS WERE STILL REVIEWING THESE CHANGES AND AND I LOOK FORWARD TO REVIEWING THAT THE REVISED LANGUAGE -- THE FIRST THING I'D LIKE TO SAY IS THAT -- WE NOTED EARLIER IN THIS YEAR THAT IT'S POSSIBLE THAT. SOME OF THE FOR COUNTIES OR REFERENCE COULD HAVE SOME SAVINGS FROM THE EXPANSION OF MEDICARE ALL TO THE UNDOCUMENTED YOUNG ADULT POPULATION. GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL AS SENSUALLY A A POLICY CHOICE TO ALLOW THOSE FUNDS TO REMAIN AT THE LOCAL LEVEL FOR LOCAL PRIORITIES THAT'S A REASONABLE PRIORITY -- BUT ONE THAT THE LEGISLATURE SHOULD WEIGH AGAINST ITS OTHER PRIORITIES IN THE BUDGET -- THE NEXT THING IS IS THAT WE WE CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT IT IS REASONABLE -- FOR THE THE STATE. TO AND THE STOP THE THE FLOW OF REALIGNMENT REVENUES TO THE SEEM AS P. BOARD UNTIL SUCH A TIME AS THE RESERVES COME DOWN TO A LOWER LEVEL. AND THE REVISED TWO YEAR -- TARGET RESERVE AMOUNT DOES APPEAR REASONABLE TO US -- HOWEVER WE WOULD NOTE THAT 75% RE DIRECTION -- EFFECTIVELY TODAY RE DIRECTS ALL OF THE THE SAME AS P. BOARDS REVENUES AND IT. LIKELY WOULD CONTINUE TO RE DIRECT ALL OF THOSE RESERVES HAD SUCH A POINT AS THEIR RECAP SORRY WOULD REDIRECT ALL THE REVENUES AT SUCH A POINT IS THERE IS THERE IS REACH THE THE LOWER TARGET. SO IN THAT SENSE75% MAY STILL BE TOO HIGH. BUT IN ANOTHER SENSE SINCE THIS WOULD TAKE PLACE SEVERAL YEARS OUT -- THE LEGISLATURE DOES NOT NECESSARILY NEED TO SET THAT 75% LEVEL TODAY -- INSTEAD THE LEGISLATURE COULD DIRECT THAT NO ADDITIONAL REVENUES WOULD BE PROVIDED UNTIL THE RESERVES REACH THAT LOWER LEVEL. AND THEN DIRECT THE ADMINISTRATION. TO RE ESTIMATE WHAT AN APPROPRIATE REDIRECTION AMOUNT WOULD BE AT THAT TIME ORDER FINANCE -- WE NOTE THAT THE BOARD IS SITTING ON A SIGNIFICANT RESERVE OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND SOLD THIS I'M NOT WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE ITS OPERATIONS. AND DELIVER HEALTHCARE SERVICES IN PARTICIPATING COUNTIES. ANYONE ELSE BEFORE WE GO TO PUBLIC COMMENT AT THIS POINT WE'LL GO AHEAD TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT. ON THIS ISSUE. GOOD MORNING MR TURN MEMBERS CAROLING UNDER THE COUNTY MEDICAL SERVICES BOARD GOVERNING BOARD WE ARE IN OPPOSITION TO THE ME REVISION WE'RE ASKING FOR THIS COMMITTEE. TO REJECT ADMINISTRATION'S PROPOSAL AND SUBSTITUTE AND WHAT HAS ALREADY BEEN OFFERED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. THE I. BOARD MET WITH FINANCE IN MARCH AND OFFERED -- ABOUT TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS TO BE REDIRECTED OUT OF THE FORTY FIVE MILLION THAT THEY RECEIVE AND THEY ALSO OFFERED A SCHEDULED SPEND DOWN OF THE RESERVE. THAT WOULD -- BOTH EXPAND CERTAIN BENEFITS BUT ALSO MAINTAIN A SOURCE OF REVENUE SO THAT THE FAMOUS PEOPLE OR TO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN THE THIRTY FIVE COMMUNITIES. INCLUDING ALMOST ALL OF YOUR DESTRUCTIVE NOT EVERY EVERY COUNTY OF YOUR TO START. MISTER FRASIER'S DISTRACT -- THIS IS THIS IS A CRITICAL BOARD IT'S NOT A NICE TO HAVE IT'S A MUST HAVE BECAUSE OF OFFERED INSTITUTIONS CODE REQUIRES. THAT THERE BE SOME ENTITY THAT PICKS UP FOR THE MEDICALLY INDIGENT POPULATION WE UNDERSTAND THE RESERVE IS AN ISSUE. BUT TAKING IT ALL THE WAY DOWN TO ZERO OR CITING THAT SO THAT I ASKED HIM IF HE CAN'T HAVE ANY MONEY AND TELLER DOWN THE LAST TWO YEARS. MAKES IT HARD FOR THEM TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THE KEY IN THE COUNTIES THAT ARE SERVING SO WE ARE IN STRONG OPPOSITION THAT ALSO JUST WANTED TO AND I HAD A FEW MORE NOTES. ON A COUPLE OF PANELS AGO WE TALKED ABOUT WORKFORCE INVESTMENT I'M FAMOUS P. IS ACTUALLY FUNDED OFSHE PAD WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT. FUNDING FOR THE MEDICAL -- WORK FORCE IN THE THIRTY FIVE COUNTIES THEY PROVIDE. MEDICAL BENEFITS TO UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS NOW ALL THE WAY UP TO AGE SIXTY FIVE IT'S NOT FULL SCOPE BECAUSE THEY HAVE EMERGENCY. COVERAGE IN A DIFFERENT -- SET OF BENEFITS BUT IF YOU ARE AN UNDOCUMENTED PERSON LIVING IN ONE OF THE THIRTY FIVE HE MUST BE COUNTIES YOU HAVE ACCESS TO A CLINIC SYSTEM WITH FORTY SEVEN SEPARATE. ADDRESSES THAT YOU CAN GO GET A PRIMARY CARE BENEFIT YOU CAN GET PRESCRIPTION MEDICATIONS AND YOU DON'T HAVE COPAYS. THEY'VE ALREADY DONE THAT ALL THE WAY TO SIXTY FIVE NOT JUST TO TWENTY SIX AND THEY ALSO HAVE OFFERED TO THE ADMINISTRATION TO GO BEYOND AND AGE SIXTY FIVE AS PART OF THE OVERALL SPEND DOWN. TO COVER UNDOCUMENTED PERSONS OVER THE AGE OF SIXTY FIVE SO THEY OFFERED A FULL MENU TO THE ADMINISTRATION. THAT IS VERY CONSISTENT WITH WHAT THE GOVERNORS TRYING TO GET TO WHAT OTHER PANELISTS HAVE TALKED ABOUT AND WE WOULD ARGUE TO REJECT ADMINISTRATIONS PUZZLE AND ADOPTING THE CITIES THANK YOU AND THE KID THE MINISTER FROM SOME ISSUES HERE IF YOU'D LIKE TO TALK ABOUT THE TECHNICAL. ASPECTS OF THIS PROPOSAL THANK YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS FARMING DATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES REPRESENTING ALL OF CALIFORNIA'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES ON THIS PROPOSAL FIRST WE WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR FOR HIS MAY REVISION PROPOSAL -- TO HOLD THE FOR WHAT WE CALL THE INBETWEENERS ARTICLE THIRTEEN COUNTIES HARMLESS SUCH A HUGE -- IMPORTANT THING FOR THEM AND WE REALLY THINK DEPARTMENT FINANCE AND THE GOVERNOR FOR SUGGESTING THAT HOPE THAT THE LEGISLATURE WILL CONFIRM IT'S A STAY IN THAT PROPOSAL. FOR THE C. M. S. P. COUNTIES ON ECHO SOME OF THE COMMENTS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER WE UNDERSTAND THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE OF HEALTHCARE IN CALIFORNIA AND IT'S HARD TO TELL WHAT THINGS WILL LOOK LIKE IN SIX TO EIGHT TO TEN YEARS -- WE I SPECIALLY WANT TO GIVE SOME WEIGHT TO THE LA OWES COMMENTS ABOUT THAT SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE AT WHEN THEY'VE GONE DOWN TO TWO YEARS RESERVES I THINK THAT WE DON'T HAVE TO SET THAT LEVEL RIGHT NOW. AND AND I THINK IT DOES MAKE SENSE OF BEHOOVE THIS ORGANIZATION TO LOOK AT IT IN A COUPLE YEARS -- AND WE'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH THE ADMINISTRATION ANDTHE LEGISLATURE ON THIS AS WELL THERE ARE SEE MUST BE COUNTIES IT IS THE RURAL HEALTH CARE SAFETY NET -- BUT AS WE THINK THERE'S A WAY WITH THE CHANGING LANDSCAPE IN CALIFORNIA THAT WE CAN WORK THROUGH THIS. THANK YOU. CHAU GIVENS OF THE COUNTY HEALTH EXECUTIVES ASSOCIATION CALIFORNIA REPRESENTED REPRESENTING LOCAL HEALTH DEPARTMENTS AND WE APPRECIATE THE ADMINISTRATION RESCINDING THE PROPOSAL TO INCREASE THE REDUCTION ABOUT FOR THOSE FOUR COUNTIES WE BELIEVE THAT FUNDING IS GOING TO REMAIN A VITAL SOURCE OF FUNDING FOR PUBLIC HEALTH ACTIVITIES AND FOR THOSE. THAT ARE SERVING THE UNDOCUMENTED POPULATIONS WOULD ALLOW THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO SO WE APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING RENTAL COMING HERE BEHALF OF HEALTH ACCESS CALIFORNIA CERTAINLY A VERY APPRECIATIVE OF THE CHANGE IN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL FOR THOSE FOR COUNTY CERTAINLY -- FOR THEM BEING ABLE TO CONTINUE THEIR PUBLIC HEALTH PROGRAMS AND ALSO A PARTICULARLY FOR SACRAMENTO AND YOLO COUNTY -- CONTINUING THE SERVICES THEY OFFER TO THE UNDOCUMENTED COMMUNITY WE ARE HOWEVER VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE C. M. S. P. PROPOSAL -- BUT WE DO KNOW THAT IF THERE WAS MONEY THAT WOULD CONTINUE TO BE REDIRECTED TO THEM THAT THEY WOULD CERTAINLY BE ABLE -- TO EXPAND THEIR PATHWAY TO HEALTH PROGRAM THAT YOU HEARD -- SOME DETAILS ABOUT CERTAINLY WE HAVE APPRECIATED THE PATHWAY TO HELP PROGRAM THAT HAS -- THAT POTENTIALLY -- OR IT WAS CREATED IN IN THE HAS THE POTENTIAL CAPACITY FOR TWENTY FIVE THOUSAND AND UNDOCUMENTED INDIVIDUALS TODAY COULD BE EXPANDED O POTENTIALLY FIFTY THOUSAND INDIVIDUALS IN THE FUTURE BUT THIS FUNDING THAT THEY WOULD GET FROM THE STATE WOULD CERTAINLY HELP THEM BE ABLE TO CONTINUE IT INTO PERPETUITY. SO WE ASK THE LEGISLATURE -- TO MAKE CONSIDERATIONS ABOUT -- THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL THAT CAN HELP C. M. S. P. COUNTIES TO CONTINUE TO DELIVER SERVICES TO THAT POPULATION -- THAT MOVING FORWARD INTO THE FUTURE THANK YOU VERY MUCH THANK YOU. pHI AM KERRY BROWN STEEN THEY SEEM SB MINISTRY TO OFFICER ONE ECHO -- KAREN LANGE'S COMMENTS ALSO WANTED TO GO INTO A LITTLE BIT MORE DETAIL FOR YOU ON THE SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE WE HAVE% DONE AN ANALYSIS UP TO TEN YEARS AND WE SEE THAT THERE IS NO REVENUE COMING AFTER OBSERVER SPENT DOWN. TO TWO YEARS OF OPERATING EXPENSES WHICH MAKES RUNNING A PROGRAM A LITTLE BIT DIFFICULT FOR NOT ABLE TO SEE A SUSTAINABLE REVENUE COMING THROUGH -- WE ALSO I'M HERE FOR ANY QUESTIONS -- WE DO HAVE THE NEW PATH TO HEALTH PROGRAM IT DOES COVER THE UNDOCUMENTED. AGES -- TWENTY ONE TO SIXTY FOUR ONE OF OUR PROPOSED CONCEPTS THAT WE PRESENTED TO YOU -- THE ADMINISTRATION IS COVERING THOSE SIXTY FIVE PLUS. I IN THIS PRIMARY CARE BENEFIT AS WELL AND WE ALSO HAVE OUR OUR WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM THAT DOES COVER NURSE PRACTITIONERS IN P. A.'S. AND THE RURAL COUNTIES AND IF YOU HAVE ANY OTHER QUESTIONS PLEASE FEEL FREE TO REACH OUT TO ME. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO ANYONE ELSE. BRING BACK TO THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS OR COMMENTS. THANK YOU HAVE A QUESTION MISTER FREEZE YEAH. FIRST WHAT WE WANT TO THANK THE DEPARTMENT PLAN IS I I'M OFFENDED WITH ANY AGENCY SITS ON THIS MUCH MONEY. IT STAGNATES OF THE ABILITY TO HELP PEOPLE. I MEAN WE ALL HAVE AN EXPECTATION THE WIND OUT MONIES ALLOCATED GOES TO THE DIRECTION THAT IS SUPPOSED TO BE UTILIZED. AND I I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU COULD ACTUALLY EVEN. LOOK SOMEBODY IN THE FACE WITH THIS MUCH MONEY NOT GOING OUT TO THIS POPULATION IN A TIMELY MANNER -- BUT I DO APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT. WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO UNDERSTAND THAT HOWEVER THIS HAPPENED THAT. THESE RESOURCES NEED TO BE UTILIZED AND I THINK SEVENTY FIVE TWENTY FIVE IS A LITTLE ONEROUS. GOING FORWARD I HOPE WE CAN GET TO YES. WAS US YOU MUST BE. ON SOME KIND OF PROGRAM GOING. FOR BUT OBVIOUSLY HAD THIS NOT BEEN FOUND IT IS SITTING ON THIS NEXT YEAR THE NEXT YEAR THE NEXT YEAR. AND POSSIBLY MAY EVEN MAKING GROWING -- MAYBE IS THIS MUCH MONEY SITTING THERE LOOKING AT THEIR WORK FIRST DEVELOPMENT. THAT WE MAKE A CONCERTED EFFORT AND MAKE THIS MONEY BE EXPENDED ON PROVIDERS -- AND AND THERE'S A RESOURCE ONE TIME FOR OPPORTUNITY -- THAT NEED NEEDS ARE THERE. SO I'M HOPING THAT WE CAN COME TO A SOLUTION AND HOW TO GET T. AND AND THE CMS P.. BUT I'M I'M GONNA FALL IS CLOSELY -- BECAUSE I THINK THAT -- IT'S ACTUALLY OFFENSIVE THAT THIS MUCH MONEY WAS NOT RESOURCE AND UTILIZE FOR THE INTENDED POPULATIONS. SEE NO A PRETTY COMMENTS MISTER FRAZIER SAYING NO ADDITIONAL COMMENTS WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. SEVEN SURE SO -- THE NEXT ITEM -- IS ALLOCATING A ONE TIME A TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND. TO COUNTIES THAT DON'T CURRENTLY PARTICIPATE IN OUR WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS SO UNDER OUR SECTION ELEVEN FIFTEEN MEDICAID WAIVER THAT WAS -- NEGOTIATED BACK IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY FIFTEEN COUNTIES WERE ABLE TO APPLY TO US -- AND START TO CREATE WHAT ARE KNOWN AS WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS WE CURRENTLY HAVE TWENTY FIVE IN THE STATE AND WE HAVE LARGE COUNTY SUCH AS LOS ANGELES WE HAVE SMALL COUNTY SUCH AS MARIPOSA AND PLASTER. THAT -- THE IDEA BEHIND WHOLE PERSON CARE WAS REALLY TO HAVE -- COUNTIES AS WELL AS NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS MEDICAL MANAGED CARE PLANS PROVIDER GROUPS -- PUBLIC SAFETY ENTITIES THAT DON'T NORMALLY -- WORK IN COLLABORATION WITH EACH OTHER TO KNOCK DOWN SILOS AND COLLECTIVELY TREAT INDIVIDUALS THAT ARE USING A MULTITUDE OF SERVICES ACROSS ALL OF THOSE DIFFERENT ENTITIES AND THEY HAVE BEEN -- IN MANY CASES REALLY -- EMBRACED BY THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE BEEN USING THOSE -- FUNDS -- THROUGH THE WAIVER BUT WE ALSO ARE HEARTENED BY THE FACT THAT IT HAS DONE DRAMATIC -- THINGS TO CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY OF PEOPLE'S LIVES THAT HAVE BEEN IN THESE PILOTS I KNOW THAT THERE'S BEEN REALLY -- POSITIVE COVERAGE IN THE LOCAL SACRAMENTO BEE AROUND THE CITY OF SACRAMENTO DOING HOPE PERSON CARE PILOTS AS WELL AS UP IN. PLASTER AND ELSEWHERE IN TERMS OF HELPING INDIVIDUALS GET OFF THE STREETS -- RECEIVE SUPPORT OF SERVICES -- AND SO. WE ARE LOOKING ALREADY TO THE RENEWAL OF OUR ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVER -- J. C. HAS BEEN -- DOING LOTS OF THINKING ON THAT PARTICULAR AB PROJECT IN PARTICULAR BUT REALLY THIS TWENTY MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION IS FOR US TO WORK WITH THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICIPATING IN WHOLE PERSON CARE. TO HELP THEM START TO DO THE PLANNING AND INFRASTRUCTURE AND BUILDING -- FOR OUR INTENT WHICH IS TO MAKE THIS CONSISTENT AND MORE OF A STATEWIDE BENEFIT AVAILABLE AFTER TWENTY TWENTY SO WE WOULD BE DOING -- GRANTS TO COUNTIES AND AWARDING THOSE FUNDS -- BY MARCH OF NEXT YEAR -- SUCH THAT THEY CAN START THE WORK AND OUR WAIVER EXPIRES IN DECEMBER OF TWENTY TWENTY AND SO THE IDEA IS THIS TO HELP KIND OF BUILD. SOME OF THAT -- PROGRAMMATIC AN OPERATIONAL -- INFRASTRUCTURE AND OBVIOUSLY THE COUNTIES TO DATE HAVE CHOSEN POPULATIONS -- THAT ARE THE MOST EITHER -- WITH A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF CHRONIC DISEASES OR HAVE BEEN KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC SAFETY SYSTEM OR STRUGGLING WITH MENTAL ILLNESS AND SO CERTAINLY THE USE OF THESE FUNDS. AND THE USE OF THE OTHER FUNDS THAT WE HAVE BEEN PUTTING INTO A WHOLE PERSON CARE SUCH AS THE HUNDRED MILLION THAT WAS ALLOCATED THE GOVERNOR'S JANUARY BUDGET. HAVE REALLY BEEN TARGETED TOWARDS INDIVIDUALS WITH MENTAL ILLNESS JUST BECAUSE OF THE DUPLICATION OF OVERLAPPING SERVICES THAT A LOT OF INDIVIDUALS IN OUR PROGRAM HAVE WITH MENTAL ILLNESS. AND HAPPY TO TAKE QUESTIONS WHERE -- BEN JOHNSON LA I WE'RE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THIS PROPOSAL BUT HAVE NO CONCERNS AT THIS TIME. FINANCE. NO I'M CONFIRMING OF FINANCE NO FURTHERCOMMENTS BUT THE QUESTION. ANYONE ELSE SIR OKAY ALL RIGHT THE PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. THANK YOU DOCTOR REDFORD IMITATING ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA STATE ASSOCIATION OF COUNTIES WE CARE A LOT ABOUT THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PROGRAM WE FIRST WANT TO SAY GO ON RECORD AGAIN IN THINKING THE GOVERNOR AND THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE PROPOSING A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS FOR EXISTING WHOLE PERSON. CHARACTER PILOTS DH CS DID -- DEVELOPING ALLOCATION FOR THAT HUNDRED MILLION IN APRIL -- WITHOUT OUTSIDE INPUT AND WE DID WANT TO NOTE THAT THERE'S A COUPLE OF MISMATCHES IN THE ALLOCATION AND BETWEEN WHAT COUNTIES DO DIRECTOR CAN ALSO MENTIONED IT. THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS EACH COUNTY DEVELOP THEIR TARGET POPULATION THAT TARGET POPULATION MAY NOT BE EXACT LEE MASH WITH THE HUNDRED MILLION PROPOSAL OF GOING TO THOSE WITH SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS AND HOMELESS OR AT RISK OF HOMELESSNESS. WE HAVE PEOPLE IN THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS WHO DO NOT HAVE SEVERE MENTAL ILLNESS BUT MAYBE A CHRONIC HEALTH CARE CONDITION. SO WE'D LIKE THAT ALLOCATION OF TO BE ABLE TO USE FOR THE TARGET POPULATIONS OF EACH EXISTING WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT WE ALSO THINK THAT -- WE NEED THE FLEXIBILITY IN THAT HUNDRED MILLION FUNDING IT'S GREAT FUNDING -- BUT THE GOVERNOR'S INDICATED THAT -- DOESN'T NECESSARILY WANT TO USE IT ON TENDENCY BASED SERVICES AND THOSE ARE EXACTLY THE SERVICES WE NEED -- TO GET THESE MOST WONDERFUL PEOPLE INTO HOUSING -- AND SO WE CAN USE SOME MEDICAID FUNDING THROUGH THE PILOT -- FOR GETTING PEOPLE INTO HOUSING BUT THE TENNESSEE BASED SERVICES WE CAN'T USE THAT WE'D LIKE TO SEE THE WHOLE HUNDRED MILLION BE ABLE TO BE USED FOR THAT. IT'S STATE ONLY MONEY SO IT'S NOT SUBJECT TO THE MEDICAID REGULATIONS OR THE WAIVER AND SO WE THINK THERE'S A GREAT OPPORTUNITY THERE WE HAVE A LETTER WITH ALL OF THIS HOT OFF THE PRESSES TO YOU. LASTLY ON THE ALLOCATION AS GIVEN THESE CONCERNS WERE HOPING THAT DH CS WILL REVISED ALLOCATION AND THAT THIS BODY WOULD INCLUDE -- PERHAPS BUDGET BILL LANGUAGE OR TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE -- REQUIRING DH CS TO CONSULT WITH THE COUNTIES AS THEY DEVELOP THAT ALLOCATION JUST TO MAKE THE MONEY WORK MOST EFFICIENTLY AT THE LOCAL LEVEL LASTLY ON THE TWENTY MINUTES MILLION WE'RE VERY GRATEFUL AND EXCITED ABOUT THAT. WE DON'T KNOW A WHOLE PERSON CARE WILL LOOK LIKE POST THE TWENTY TWENTY WAIVER BUT WE'RE REALLY EXCITED WE HAVE A LOT OF COUNTIES MANY SMALL COUNTIES. OR INTERESTED IN JUMPING ON BOARD THEY'VE SEEN HOW THE PILOTS HAVE BEEN WORKING SO FAR IN OTHER COUNTIES. SO WE REALLY WANT TO DO THAT AND THAT BECAUSE THAT IS -- BASED FOR MENTAL ILLNESS AND IT'S PRO SUSPECTED OF WE THINK THAT WORKS JUST FINE FOR THE TWENTY MILLION BUT THE HUNDRED MILLION IT NEEDS TO MATCH THE TARGET POPULATIONS THANK YOU. YOU [inaudible] SIR. DOCTOR TO MADDEN RIBS IN THE CALIFORNIA CHAPTER THE AMERICAN CALLS RUMORS EFFICIENCY MORE SUPPORT OF THE ADDITIONAL TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IN JUST WANNA SURE QUICK SUCCESS THAT WE'RE SEEING HERE IN SACRAMENTO. TO BUILD OFFER DIRECTOR KEN'S COMMENTS AT UC DAVIS -- WE HAVE A WE SEE THIS HIGH RISK POPULATION ON A DAILY BASIS AND ONE OF THE KEYS TO THE SUCCESS FOR US AND CONNECTING THEM TO THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOT. IS TO HAVE A COUNSELOR IN THE MERCY DEPARTMENT WHO'S ABLE TO TALK TO THIS HIGH RISK POPULATION AND REALLY SHOW THEM THAT THERE ARE PROGRAMS OUT THERE THAT CAN HELP. WE FOUND ONE OF THE CHALLENGES IS GETTING PEOPLE INTO THESE PROGRAMS AT THE RIGHT TIME AND WE SEE THAT OPPORTUNITY NUMBERS TO DEPARTMENT. NOW UC DAVIS'S UNIQUE HAVING THIS RESOURCE NOT EVERY EMERGENCY DEPARTMENT HAS A COUNSELOR -- WITH THE MARINES VISIONS ARE SPONSORING A BUDGET REQUEST THAT WOULD PROVIDE A GRANT PROGRAM TO PLACE ADDITIONAL CANCERS NUMBERS APARTMENT WHICH WE SEE AS A NICE FIT.

LINDA WAY WITH WESTERN CENTER ON LAW AND POVERTY WE SUPPORT THAT PROPOSAL TO EXPAND. THE WHOLE PERSON CARE BEYOND THE PILOT COUNTIES WILL NOTE THAT.

MS NAY DATING FROM SEIZE ACT THANK YOU [inaudible] THANK YOU [inaudible] THE QUESTIONS. OF WHAT THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR THE PRESENTATION JUST A JUST A QUESTION SO. THE WE HAVE TWENTY FIVE COUNTIES. ON BOARD NOW AND THE PROPOSAL OF THE TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS IS TO HELP. THE A THE ADDITIONAL THIRTY THREE COUNTIES BECOME A PART OF THE PROJECT IS THAT IS THAT MY UNDERSTANDING. OR DID I MISS SOMETHING. YES SO TO BE AS WE TRANSITION -- I'M IN LOVE LOOK AT MY LIFE PLANET SITTING NEXT TO ME -- AS WE TRANSITION OUT OF THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN RIVER AT THE END OF TWENTY TWENTY IT'S OUR INTEREST AND ALLOWING FOR A LOT OF THE ACTIVITIES THAT HAPPEN UNDER THE ELEVEN FIFTEEN TO BE DONE THROUGH DIFFERENT WAIVER AUTHORITIES -- SUCH AS A YOU KNOW NINETEEN FIFTEEN RIVER WHEN WE MOVE OUR MANAGED CARE PROGRAM INTO THAT AND SO -- AND THERE'S DIFFERENT FEDERAL THINGS THAT ALLOW FOR THAT TO OCCUR I THINK WHAT WE WILL BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES ON THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY PARTICIPATING WHOLE PERSON CARE IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE TO HELP THEM -- DO LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE COUNTIES THAT HAVE ALREADY COME BEFORE THEM -- SO THE MONEY IN SOME CASES IS INTENDED TO HELP EITHER EXPEDITE OR DO SOME WORK IN ADVANCE OF THAT CONVERSATION I THINK THAT -- IT DOESN'T PRECLUDE US COMING AND IN FUTURE -- DISCUSSIONS WITH THE LEGISLATURE IN THE ADMINISTRATION ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT COUNTIES WILL NEED ADDITIONAL SUPPORT IN THIS AREA TO EFFECTUATE THE WHOLE PERSON CARE BUT I THINK JUST FOR PURPOSES OF THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION -- THIS MONEY IS INTENDED TO WORK WITH SOME OF THE AREAS OF THE STATE THAT HAVE NOT HAD A WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS OF ALL RIGHT SO THE WHOLE PERSON CARE PILOTS OF REALLY TRADITIONALLY BEEN -- COVERING A LOT OF THE MORE URBAN AREAS OF THE STATE AND SO THIS IS REALLY INTENDED TO TRY TO WORK WITH COUNTIES THAT HAVE NOT HAD ANY TRADITIONAL -- INVOLVED ARE ELEVEN FIFTEEN WAIVERS. OKAY WELL I APPRECIATE THAT I THINK -- OFTENTIMES THE THE THE RURAL COUNTIES THAT THE DON'T PARTICIPATE ONE OF THE THINGS IS LACKING OBVIOUSLY IS TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE. AND THAT MAKES IT REALLY HARD FOR THEM TO TO TO PARTICIPATE BUT ALSO I HOPE THAT DID THE ADMINISTRATION IN GENERAL -- CONSIDERS THE THE PLEA FOR FLEXIBILITY -- EVERY EVERY COUNTY IS NOT CREATED EQUAL AND THE CHALLENGES WITH INDIVIDUAL COUNTIES ARE ARE A CAN BE SIGNIFICANT. AND THAT MAY BE INDEED ONE OF THE REASONS THAT YOU'RE NOT SEEN SOME THE PARTICIPATION. OF BYE BYE BYE RURAL COUNTIES IS A FEAR THAT THERE ISN'T THAT GOING TO BE THAT FLEXIBILITY AND WHAT'S BEING OFFERED MAY NOT MAY NOT FIT WITH WITH WITH. WITH THEIR COUNTIES OPERATE SO RIGID THAT MEANING ONE OF OUR TWO FAVORITE COUNTIES ARE. THAT AND SAID BENITO ARE IN WHOLE PERSON CARE TOGETHER -- EVEN THOUGH THEY'RE NOT CONTIGUOUS TO EACH OTHER SO THEY HAVE FIGURED IT OUT AND WE'RE VERY PROUD OF THAT AND SO I THINK WHAT WE'RE LOOKING TO DO IS HELP SUPPORT OTHER COUNTIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH -- WITH THAT -- WILL GO AHEAD AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER. EIGHT SURE SO THIS IS -- I KNOW THAT -- THIS -- PROPOSAL WAS HEARD BY THIS COMMITTEE AND ELSEWHERE SO I WON'T -- SPEND A TON OF TIME I THINK THAT IT'S INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISION -- FOR THE AMOUNT THAT WAS PASSED. BY THE STAKEHOLDERS IN PREVIOUS TESTIMONY IN TERMS OF IT'LL BE A THREE POINT SIX MILLION DOLLAR APPROPRIATION FROM THE MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES FUND. OVER THE NEXT THREE FISCAL YEARS TO IMPLEMENT THE CALIFORNIA PEER RUN WARM LINE IT'S OUR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS WAS A FUNCTION THAT WAS PROVIDED ON A% TWENTY FOUR SEVEN BASIS UNTIL THERE WAS FUNDING REDUCED -- AND SO THEY'VE BEEN OPERATE ON A MORE LIMITED BASIS AND THIS ALLOCATION WILL ALLOW THEM TO OFFER -- TWENTY FOUR SEVEN SERVICE THROUGHOUT THE STATE --% AND SO THAT IS THE IN THAT HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN THE GOVERNOR'S MAY REVISIONS [inaudible] FINANCE. YOU FOR THE COMMENT AT THIS TIME -- BEN JOHNSON -- WITH THE LA -- WE'RE CONTINUING TO REVIEW THIS AND THE NEXT ITEM AND WILL PROVIDE ANY FEEDBACK THAT WE DO HAVE -- AT A LATER TIME. PUBLICADO PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. HELLO WILL HOME REPRESENTING THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA -- WOULD NOTE THAT WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THE EXPANSION OF PEER BASED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH SERVICES IN GENERAL AND AGREE THAT PROVIDING PEER SERVICES THROUGH. A WARM LINE CAN BE AN IMPORTANT WAY TO REACH MORE CALIFORNIANS EXPERIENCING MENTAL HEALTH CRISES IN CONDITIONS. WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THIS PROPOSAL WILL BE IMPLEMENTED -- FOR STRICKEN CERTAIN THAT SOME ASPECTS OF THE WARM LINE COULD BE DUPLICATIVE WE DO HAVE CURRENT SYSTEMS OF SUICIDE PREVENTION AND CRISIS LINES. OPERATED BY COUNTIES REGIONALLY AND AT THE STATE LEVEL OF THOSE LINES DO YOU INCLUDE PEERS -- AND PROVIDERS WITH LIVED EXPERIENCES. THERE'S ALSO A QUALITY I AM CONCERNED AS PART OF COUNTIES OPERATION. OF CURRENT CRISIS LINES -- WE'VE BEEN INVOLVED WITH RESEARCHERS AND ENSURING ONGOING QUALITY MONITORING AND ASSESSING OUTCOMES FOR THOSE PREVENTION PLATFORMS SO WE THINK THAT SHOULD BE. A COMPONENT OF ANY ADDITIONAL WARM LINE PROPOSAL. AND FINALLY WE WOULD WANT TO ENSURE COORDINATION WITH EXISTING SYSTEMS OF CARE SO THAT PEOPLE THAT UTILIZE THE WARM LINE -- ARE ABLE TO ACCESS REFERRALS TO ON GOING CARE AND SUPPORTS WITHIN THE PUBLICLY FUNDED BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT SYSTEM SO VERY SUPPORTIVE OF THE CONCEPT BUT HOPE THE STATE WILL THINK QUIT CRITICALLY ABOUT HOW TO COORDINATE THIS STRATEGY WITH EXISTING WARM LINE STRATEGIES AND RESOURCES FOR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH TREATMENT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH SO. REQUEST ANYONE ELSE [inaudible] THE QUESTIONS. SEEING NONE THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH GO AHEAD MOVE ON TO ISSUE NUMBER EIGHT NINE EXCUSE ME. OUR GREAT THANK YOU SO -- AS THIS COMMITTEE HAS HEARD IN PRIOR -- MEETINGS THERE ARE -- IS AT FUNDING THAT IS COMING TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES THROUGH. THE PASSAGE OF PROPOSITION -- SIXTY FOUR IN THE MAY REVISION -- AND CONSISTENT WITH THE WAY THE FUNDING FLOWS IN WE WILL BE -- EXECUTING INTERAGENCY AGREEMENTS WITH THE DEPARTMENT OF PUBLIC HEALTH THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND THE CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY FOR THE ITEMS THAT ARE NOTED IN THE AGENDA -- FOR THE FUNDING THAT HAS BEEN -- DEDICATED TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH CARE SERVICES WHICH IS TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS -- WE WILL BE -- CONVENING A STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS IS -- REQUIRED THROUGH THE INITIATIVE -- AND THEN -- MAKING. GRANTS. AVAILABLE ON A COMPETITIVE BASIS TO PROGRAMS THAT EMPHASIZE PREVENTION EDUCATION AND EARLY INTERVENTION FOR USE CONSISTENT WITH THE PURPOSES OF THE ACT. I THINK -- WE ARE EXCITED. ABOUT THIS OPPORTUNITY BECAUSE THERE'S OFTEN NOT A LOT OF FUNDING MADE AVAILABLE FOR PREVENTION -- EDUCATION EARLY INTERVENTION SO I THINK THAT THAT WILL BE -- THE FOCUS OF OUR PARTICULAR -- POLICY AREA BUT CERTAINLY WILL BE INFORMED BY THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS AS WELL AND THEN WE'RE HAPPY -- TO KEEP THE LEGISLATURE APPRISED OF THE PROCESS AS IT AS IT ROLLS FORWARD BUT IT'S A TWENTY ONE AND A HALF MILLION DOLLAR. APPROPRIATION TO US FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS FOR PURPOSES OF YOUR AGENDA [inaudible] THANK YOU -- FINANCE. HELLO NOW. A PUBLIC COMMENT ON THIS ISSUE. MISTER CHAIRMAN MISTER CHAIR HI. ROBERT HARRIS ON BEHALF HAS HE ARE YOU CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE NO OBJECTIONS WITH. THE BASIC DIRECTION THE THE DEPARTMENT'S GOING UNFORTUNATELY THERE WASN'T A PLANNING PROCESS THAT HAPPENED BEFORE THIS. HELLO PEOPLE I'VE TALKED ABOUT DOING IT AND SO WE'RE WORRIED THAT WHAT IT AMOUNTS TO IS YOU HAVE TWENTY AND A HALF MILLION DOLLARS WHICH ISN'T. A WHOLE LOT TO DO ANYTHING IN THE STATE. AND THAT MONEY WOULD PROBABLY BE BETTER SPENT. DOING AT A NEEDS ASSESSMENT PLANNING PROCESS FIND OUT WHAT'S OUT THERE AND NO ONE NO ONE REALLY KNOWS FROM EARLY INTERVENTION PREVENTION AND TREATMENT. NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S OUT THERE FOR KIDS AND YET WE'RE GONNA PUSH MONEY OUT THE DOOR WHICH WE UNDERSTAND HAS TO HAPPEN BECAUSE OF THE WORD THE TERMS OF THE INITIATIVE. BUT GOING FORWARD WE'RE WE BELIEVE. THAT. AN ASSESSMENT OF WHAT'S OUT THERE. AND THEN AND THEN HOW IT WILL ALL WORK WE DON'T KNOW WHEN WE SEND MONEY TO PREVENTION WE DON'T KNOW WHAT. THERE'S BEEN BLOCK GRANT MONEY ONE OF PREVENTION FOR YEARS BUT SEVENTY BLOCK GRANT MONEY THIS MONEY. THE GHOST WOULD PREVENTION SHOULD BE COORDINATED WITH THAT THE INITIATIVE CALLS OUT. FOR NOT NOT SUB PLANNING RIGHT. BUT ACTUALLY ABBOTT BEING ADDITIVE [inaudible] THANK YOU. MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS HOW IMMEASURABLE HAVE THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF ALCOHOL AND DRUG PROGRAM EXECUTIVES WERE STATEWIDE ASSOCIATION PROVIDING SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER TREATMENT. OR IN OVER THREE HUNDRED SITES AROUND THE STATE -- WE ARE VERY CONCERNED AND ARE A DISAPPOINTED IN THE DISTRIBUTION WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY AN 8020% DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN EDUCATION AND TREATMENT AND WE WOULD LOOK FOR A MORE EQUITABLE. DISTRIBUTION -- ONE AND MAINLY BECAUSE THERE ARE MANY CHILDREN AND MANY KIDS. WHO ARE NOT IN SCHOOL AND NOT IN THE EDUCATION SYSTEM AND THEIR NEEDS FOR RESOURCES -- TO ASSIST THEM IS JUST AS GREAT AS A KID IN SCHOOL. SO -- WE WE WERE LOOKING -- FOR SOME ADDITIONAL RESOURCES FOR OUT OF SCHOOL CHILDREN -- IN ADDITION. WE ALSO SUPPORT AN ASSESSMENT AND A VERY ROBUST BECAUSE HAS MEANT THAT SHOULD BE PROVIDED SHOULD BE DONE. BEFORE ANY FUNDS ARE ALLOCATED EVEN THIS DISTRIBUTION BETWEEN EDUCATION AND AT AND TREATMENT. THAT -- THE ROBUST -- ASSESSMENT NEEDS TO BE -- TAKEN PLACE IN. THE ASSESSMENT AS OUTLINED IN AB TEN TWENTY TEN I'M SORRY -- TEN NINETY EIGHT WHICH YOU AND ASSEMBLYMAN -- O'DONNELL ARE SUPPORTING IS SOMETHING THAT WE'VE BEEN WORKING ON AND I THINK THAT THAT KIND OF ROBUST ASSESSMENT -- NEEDS TO TAKE PLACE IN ORDER TO IDENTIFY THE AREAS OF GREATEST NEED AND THE GAPS IN SERVICE IN THE CURRENT SERVICES. AND IT THE THAT KIND OF ASSESSMENT GO A LONG WAY TO INFORM DECISIONS ABOUT DISTRIBUTION OF THE FUNDS THANK YOU. HELLO WILL HOME REPRESENTING THE COUNTY BEHAVIORAL HEALTH DIRECTORS ASSOCIATION AND AS YOU KNOW COUNTIES ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ADMINISTERING PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT SERVICES FOR YOUTH WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS. WE WOULD NOTE THAT PROP SIXTY FOUR PRESENTS A REALLY UNPRECEDENTED OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST IN A FULL CONTINUUM OF SUBSTANCE USE DISORDER CARE FOR YOUTH SO INCLUDING PREVENTION EARLY INTERVENTION AND TREATMENT. WE HAVE A COUPLE OF CONCERNS WITH THE CURRENT PROPOSALS AND THAT THEY DIRECT THE BULK OF THE FUNDING TO PREVENTION AND EARLY INTERVENTION -- WHICH DOES VERY LITTLE TO HELP YOUTH WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH SUBSTANCE USE AND NEED TO M. SERVICES FARTHER ON THE TREATMENT SIDE OF THE CONTINUUM. SIXTY FOUR AS APPROVED BY THE VOTERS DOES SPECIFY THAT FUND SHOULD BE USED FOR THAT FULL SPECTRUM OF CARE -- WE WOULD ALSO ECHO COMMENTS FROM C. SALMON CAD P. AND RECOMMENDING THAT BEFORE UNDERTAKING A COMPETITIVE GRANT PROCESS -- TO ALLOCATE THE TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION THREE DH CS. THE STATE SHOULD THINK ABOUT UNDERTAKING A COMPREHENSIVE NEEDS ASSESSMENT AND MORE OF A STRATEGIC PLANNING PROCESS TO REALLY IDENTIFY WHERE THE GAPS ARE IN OUR CURRENT SYSTEM OF CARE AND HOW THESE PROP SIXTY FOUR RESOURCES CAN BE COORDINATED AND YOU STRATEGICALLY ALONG WITH EXISTING RESOURCES. TO BUILD OUT THE SERVICE AS THANK YOU. CAN LOS REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA COALITION FOR YEARS AND JUST WANTED TO HIGHLIGHT. OUR DISAPPOINTMENT A LACK OF ATTENTION TO YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND I'M IN THE USE OF THE RESOURCES UNDER. C. EIGHT SAID SPECIFICALLY AN INITIATIVE THAT GRANTS TO PROGRAMS FOR OUR REACH EDUCATION AND TREATMENT FOR HOMELESS YOUTH IN OUT OF SCHOOL YOUTH WITH SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS COULD HAVE BEEN ONE OF THE USES OF THESE FUNDS. THE STATE HAS UNDER INVESTED IN THIS POPULATION FOR YEARS WE ONLY DEDICATE LESS THAN TWO MILLION DOLLARS ON AN ONGOING BASIS. IN GENERAL FUND RESOURCES TO SUPPORT YOUTH EXPERIENCING HOMELESSNESS AND IT'S NO SURPRISE TO ME THAT WE HAVE A GROWING HOMELESS POPULATION AND STATE -- THE NUMBER ONE INDICATOR OF HOMELESSNESS IS A LACK OF A GED -- FOR A LOT OF STUDENTS SO THERE IS A BIG CONNECTION THERE AND YOUTH ARE USUALLY COPING WITH THE TRAUMA OF BEING ON THE STREET OR REASON. THAT THEY'RE ON THE STREET IS DO YOU SUBSTANCE ABUSE ISSUES -- I KNOW SOMEONE MEMBER RARE SENT TO SOMEONE RUBIO HAVE BEEN STRONG SUPPORTERS OF ADVOCATING FOR PROPOSAL AROUND HOW DO WE ADDRESS THE NEEDS OF THESE YEARS. AND FROM A DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE PERSPECTIVE OF NOT LIKING -- I'M GOING TO HAVE FUN COMMITMENTS THAT THIS IS A GOOD USE A SPECIAL FUND RESOURCES THANK YOU. SURE IT IS CALIFORNIA CONSORTIUM OF ADDICTION PROGRAMS AND PROFESSIONALS ALTHOUGH IN EXPENDITURES ON FIGHTING ADDICTION ARE GOOD. DON'T HAVE ANY COMPLAINTS ABOUT THEM -- AND ALTHOUGH CHILD CARE IS A BIT OF A STRETCH IN PREVENTION BUT FOR THIS YEAR I GUESS WE CAN. WE CAN LOOK FORWARD TO THAT WE JUST HOPING THAT A ROBUST PLANNING PROCESS DOES OCCUR SO THAT IN THE FUTURE THESE FUNDS ARE SPENT WISELY. AND PARTICULAR NOT ONLY DO WE NEED TO KNOW WHERE SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE WE NEED TO KNOW WHAT TYPE WE PARTICULAR NEED TO WHAT WORK FORCE IS PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES. WHETHER THEY'RE QUALIFIED TO DO SO BOTH IN THE EDUCATIONAL SETTINGS AND IN THE TREATMENT SETTINGS SO A LOT OF WORK TO DO -- TO MAKE THIS THING WORK AND WE'VE GOT TIME TO DO THAT AND WE APPRECIATE WORKING WITH YOU AND WITH THAT IN THE FUTURE THANK YOU [inaudible] ANYONE ELSE. SEE NO BRING IT BACK ANY COMMENTS QUESTIONS. IS THE CUP I JUST HAVE A COUPLE COMMENTS -- WE APPRECIATE THE ADDITIONAL MONEY OBVIOUSLY -- FOR PROGRAMMING -- I THINK YOU'VE HEARD FROM MANY THE ADVOCATES HERE THAT THEY WISH THAT THERE WAS A PLANNING PROCESS IN PLACE. I KNOW THERE WERE LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS -- RECENTLY AS A YEAR OR TWO AGO ASKING THAT WE ACTUALLY PUT TOGETHER WORKING GROUP'S TO ACTUALLY LOOK AT HOW WE HOW THIS IS SPENT THOSE PROP THOSE DIDN'T MAKE IT -- FOR VARIETY OF FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS SO -- YOU TALKED ABOUT COMPETITIVE GRANTS -- SO HOW DOES THAT WORK -- HOW DO YOU ENVISION THAT WORKING ONCE AGAIN -- RURAL AREAS -- HAVE A HARD TIME COMPETING WITH LARGER URBAN AREAS AND I WOULD ARGUE -- BASED ON JUST MY DISTRICT THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT HAVE BEEN MOST AFFECTED BY -- CANNABIS AND CANNABIS CULTIVATION THROUGHOUT NORTHERN CALIFORNIA CENTRAL CALIFORNIA -- ARE. I I THINK AT A HAVE HAVE A AT A HIGHER RISK OF HAD HIGHER PROBLEMS THERE. SO HOW DO YOU ENVISION -- AWAY THAT GIVES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR SOME OF THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT WERE MOST AFFECTED. TO ACTUALLY BECAUSE IT IS IN IN THE CAR IN THE WORLD COMPETITION -- OFTENTIMES THOSE COMMUNITIES CAN UNITIES LOOSE AND THAT WAS I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WAS THE INTENT OF PROP. SIXTY FOUR YEAH SO THOSE ARE GREAT QUESTIONS I THINK YOU KNOW A COUPLE OF RESPONSES -- THE FIRST IS THAT THE THE GRANTS NEED TO BE INFORMED BY THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS THAT THE INITIATIVE CONTEMPLATES SO WILL BE CONVENING THAT IN TERMS OF PROVIDING INPUT TO US ON YOU KNOW EITHER PRIORITY -- AREAS TO FOCUS ON A PRIORITY ACTIVITIES THE THE TEAM THAT WILL BE LEADING THIS WORK WITHIN THE DEPARTMENT ARE ALSO THE ONES THAT HAVE BEEN WORKING EXTENSIVELY ON THAT -- FEELING GRANT -- ACTIVITIES AND I KNOW THAT WE HAVE SPENT A LOT OF TIME -- IN CERTAIN PARTS OF YOUR DISTRICT AS WELL AS OTHER PARTS OF THE STATE IN WHICH THERE ARE NOT. THE SAME KIND OF RESOURCES AND CAPACITY -- AND SO WE'VE SPENT A FAIR AMOUNT OF FEDERAL MONEY ON THE ON THE OPIOID SIDE IN PARTICULAR ABOUT BUILDING CAPACITY IN AREAS IN WHICH THERE'S NOT NECESSARILY. EITHER PROVIDERS ARE PROGRAMS I THINK THE LAST THING I WOULD SAY IS -- IT'S NOT OUR INTEREST TO DO AN OVERLY -- BUREAUCRATIC GRANT PROCESS JUST BECAUSE I'VE CERTAINLY HEARD -- THROUGH THE CHAFF AND OTHER TYPES OF GRANTS WHERE PEOPLE WILL SAY I I'D LIKE THE MONEY BUT I DON'T HAVE THE INTERNAL CAPACITY TO ACTUALLY WRITE THE GRANT AND I THINK THAT THAT'S NOT OUR INTEREST IN. IN THAT IT'S YOU KNOW. IT'S A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MONEY FOR THIS FIRST YEAR APPROPRIATION AND SO I THINK WE WANT -- TO MAKE IT AS EASY AS POSSIBLE FOR APPLICANTS TO BOTH APPLY AND USE THE MONEY IN A WAY THAT IS YOU KNOW AGAIN AND FROM BY THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS SO. I'M HOPING THAT THAT YOU KNOW WHAT WE'RE WE'RE CERTAINLY -- WILLING TO HAVE -- INCLUSION OF LEDGE STAFF AS APPROPRIATE OR POLICY STAFF -- SIT THROUGH THE SIT THROUGH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS TO HELP ALSO INFORMS THEM THAT DECISION MAKING BECAUSE SOME OF THOSE DECISIONS JUST HAVEN'T HAVEN'T BEEN MADE YET. SO WITH THE STAKEHOLDER PROCESS HAPPEN BEFORE THE AWARDING OF GRANTS YES YES. OKAY -- THAT'S THAT'S THAT'S ENCOURAGING -- AS WELL I GUESS I I WORRY THAT -- TWENTY ONE POINT FIVE MILLION DOLLARS IS NOT A HUGE AMOUNT OF MONEY IT WOULD BE EASY TO GIVE EVERYBODY A LITTLE. AND ACCOMPLISH NOTHING AND SO IT WOULD BE I WOULD HOPE THAT THERE BE A FOCUS ON COMMUNITIES THAT -- HAVE BEEN MOST AFFECTED GIVE THEM THE BEST OPPORTUNITY THERE RECOGNIZING THAT OVER TIME WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE AND MORE AND MORE MONEY COMING HERE BUT I THINK. I WOULD HOPE THAT THAT WOULD BE ONE OF ONE OF THE CONSIDERATIONS AND ALSO JUST THE THE CHALLENGE THAT. YOU KNOW SOME COMMUNITIES JUST HAVE A HARD TIME WITH THESE WITH GRANT PROCESSES SO I'M ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT THAT YOU'RE NOT TRYING WE'RE NOT TRYING. THIS OVER THE OVER THE BURDENSOME. SO -- AND THEN ALSO THERE WAS IN HERE AND AND THERE'S ALSO FIVE POINT THREE MILLION DOLLARS A CALIFORNIA NATURAL RESOURCES AGENCY TO SUPPORT YOUTH COMMUNITY ACCESS. GRANTS INCREASE ACCESS TO NATURAL CULTURAL RESOURCES. FOR LOW INCOME YOUTH AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHICH I I APPLAUD -- DOES ANYBODY KNOW HOW WEIRD HOW WE ARE IDENTIFYING DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES. IS THAT -- BASED ON THE STATE AND VIRUS SCAN OR IS THAT BASED ON OTHER CRITERIA. RYAN MILLER DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE -- THAT'S SOMETHING I THINK WHAT TO GET BACK TO YOUR STAFF ON SO WE OWE IT WE DON'T OKAY I KNOW THAT WAS PROBABLY I KNOW THAT WASN'T HIGHLIGHTED HERE BUT I WHENEVER I SEE DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES -- IT IT RAISES THE HAIR ON THE BACK OF MY NECK BECAUSE ON SOME THINGS WE ARE DISADVANTAGED IN IN IN COMMUNITIES AND OTHERS WERE NOT BASED ON THE ENVIRO SCANNED AND SO. I WOULD REALLY LIKE TO GET THAT INFORMATION BACK YEAH WE CAN WORK WITH OUR NATURAL RESOURCES YEAH WELL READ WILL WORK WITH OUR FOR WITH OUR FOLKS AT FINANCE TO WORK ON THE NATIONAL RESOURCES ISSUES AND WE'LL GET BACK TO YOU ON THAT. GREAT THANK YOU OKAY. OKAY -- IT IS NOW WE'RE GOING -- TO RECESS WILL THIS IS NOT IT WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT CLOSING THE HEARING WE'RE GOING TO RECESS FOR LUNCH WILL BE WE WILL -- RECONVENE AT ONE THIRTY SO THANK YOU THANK YOU VERY MUCH CASTOR. A LOT OF THE AS A MATTER YEAH [inaudible] SO. I MEAN IF YOU WANT TO DO THE THREE I CAN BE DISPENSED WHATEVER IS GOING TO TRY TO SAVE. OF COMPLETELY [inaudible] YEAH NO [inaudible] OKAY
