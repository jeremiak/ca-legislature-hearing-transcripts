THANK YOU AND WE WILL TAKE A MOTION ON THAT ONCE WE GET A QUORUM THANK YOU. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT WE SEEM TO HAVE A DEARTH OF AUTHORS AS WELL AS COMMITTEE MEMBERS. SO I GUESS WILL BE ON A BIT OF A POSITIVE- FOLKS SHOW UP. THIS REYES WHO ALSO HAVE A BILL WOULD YOU LIKE 2% GOOD TIMING SO WE WILL NOW MOVE TO OUR ITEM NUMBER EIGHT AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS. I PRESENT TO YOU AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY WHICH WILL AUTHORIZE THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE TO ESTABLISH A VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE PROGRAM TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE WITH THE CALIFORNIA UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LAW. I WOULD DO WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH MY OFFICE ON THE AMENDMENTS AND FOR STRENGTHENING THE BILL SO WE'RE BETTER ABLE TO BRING OUR HOLDERS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW. WHILE THE STATE HAS ESTABLISHED THE- PROCESS TO RECLAIM UNCLAIMED PROPERTY AS OF TWENTY TWENTY APPROXIMATELY ONE POINT THREE MILLION BUSINESSES. WHO FILE THEIR TAXES FAILED TO INCLUDE WITH THEIR TAXES THE UNCLAIMED PROPERTY REPORT. IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW WE ESTIMATE THAT'S ABOUT SEVENTEEN POINT SIX BILLION DOLLARS IN UNCLAIMED PROPERTY THAT TWEET COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAS NOT RECEIVED. IT'S DUE TO A COMBINATION OF A NUMBER OF THINGS INCLUDING A LACK OF AWARENESS OF THE EXISTING LAW THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPORTING AND THE POTENTIAL PRIVACY CONCERNS. THE UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LAW WAS PASSED TO PROVIDE CITIZENS AWAY TO CHECK TO SEE IF THEY HAVE ANY UNCLAIMED PROPERTY OR FOR THE ERRORS TO CHECK ON. PROPERTY THAT TO THE STATE HAS TAKEN. EVEN THOUGH BUSINESSES HAVE THE THREAT OF AN AUDIT OR ALSO THE ASSESSED ON UNCLAIMED PROPERTY- WE FIND THAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO COMPEL THEM TO PREPARE THE REPORT. AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY IS GOING TO INCREASE COMPLIANCE BY DOING A NUMBER OF THINGS FIRST IT WILL AUTHORIZE THE STATE COMPTROLLER TO ESTABLISH A VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. IT'LL ALLOW THE CONTROLLER TO WAIT INTEREST PENALTIES OTHERWISE DO UNDER THE UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LAW IF A BUSINESS COMPLETE AN EDUCATION PROGRAM SEARCHES THEIR BOOKS. AND IT SEARCHES THE BOOKS AND RECORDS FOR UNCLAIMED PROPERTY AND THEN TIMELY REPORTS AND DELIVERS THE PROPERTY UNCOVERED TO THE CONTROLLER. BAR THEY CAN ALSO BAR THIRD PARTY SERVICES THE PROMISED TO RECOVER AND CLICK PROPERTIES ON BEHALF OF MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC FROM CHARGING UP FRONT FEES. NO HERE TO TESTIFY. OF TODAY ARE INDIRA. MCDONALD'S AND GILLIAN NIGHT FROM THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE. THANK YOU I THINK I HAVE THE MEDICAID ON THE TELEPHONE BUT THE AMENDMENTS JUST FOR THE RECORD YOU ARE TAKING THOSE AMENDMENTS AS AUTHORS OF THANK YOU WE ARE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS AND THANK YOU FOR CATCHING THAT. THANK YOU ALL RIGHT SO I DO HAVE IN YOUR MATERNAL AND JULIAN KNIGHT BOTH WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE INTERMITTENT. GOOD MORNING AND THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TESTIFY MY NAME IS LINDA MCDONALD WITH THE OFFICE OF STATE CONTROLLER BETTY. I WITH ME AS DALY AT NIGHT AND SHE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS. I THINK CONTROLLER BETTY IS PLEASED TO SPONSOR AB TWENTY TWO EIGHTY WHICH ESTABLISHES THE VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. I BUSINESS OWNERS THAT ARE HOLDERS OF UNCLAIMED PROPERTY ARE REQUIRED TO REPORT REMAIN UNCLAIMED PROPERTY WHEN THERE HAS BEEN NO ACTIVITY OR CONTACT WITH THE OWNER FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF. TIME WE ESTIMATE OVER A MILLION BUSINESSES HAVE FAILED TO REPORT AN COULD BE HOLDING AN EXCESS OF SEVENTEEN POINT SIX BILLION AN UNCLAIMED PROPERTY. THE LACK OF COMPLIANCE MAY BE DUE IN PART. TO A LACK OF AWARENESS OF EXISTING LAWS AND THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH REPORTING ARE OUTDATED REPORTING PROCEDURES. EITHER WE'RE NETWORK HOLDER THE BEYOND COMPARE HOT LAST YEAR CONTROLLER SPOT LEGISLATION THAT WAS ENACTED TO PROVIDE FOR THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO ASK QUESTIONS TO THE CORPORATE TAX FORMS ABOUT UNCLAIMED PROPERTY LOSS. AND EITHER VOLUNTARY QUESTIONS FOR BUSINESSES TO ANSWER ON THE TAX FORM AND THIS INFORMATION INFORMS US ABOUT- HOLDERS WHO ARE MOST RECEPTIVE TO OUR EDUCATION OUTREACH. AND THIS BILL IS THE NEXT STEP TO PROVIDING HOLDERS WHO MAY BE FIRST TIME FILERS ARE WHO WHO MAY BE UNAWARE OF THE LOT- OR INTIMIDATED BY IT THIS IS THE PROGRAM TO FOR THEM TO COME FORWARD- AND- UNDER THE VOLUNTARY COMPLIANCE PROGRAM WHERE WE WILL PROVIDE TRAINING TO THEM AND THE TOOLS NECESSARY FOR THE HOLDERS. TO COME INTO COMPLIANCE WITH A LOT. I'M BIT SO THIS ARE UNDER CURRENT LAW THE COMPTROLLER DOES ADMINISTER THIS PROGRAM THE END OF THE PROGRAM BUT EXISTING LAW DOES NOT EXPLICITLY GRANT HER THE AUTHORITY TO CREATE AND ADMINISTER THAT. PARTICULAR PROGRAM AND SO WE ARE VERY HAPPY TO I AM PLEASED TO SPONSOR EVENTS- IT WILL ESTABLISH THE PROGRAM AND ENABLE THE CONTROLLER TO WAIVE PENALTY INTEREST FOR PAST DUE PROPERTY AS REPORTED BY HOLDERS THAT VOLUNTARILY ENROLLED- ARE ACCEPTED AND SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE THE PROGRAM- AND IT WILL INCLUDE. A DEFINITELY INCREASED A MORE PUBLIC AWARENESS- SO THAT HOLDER CAN GET INTO COMPLIANCE ADDITIONALLY AT THE BILL ENHANCES CONSUMER PROTECTIONS BY ENSURING CLAIMANTS OF PERSONAL IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION IS SHIELDED FROM PUBLIC DISCLOSURE. AND PREVENTING- AGGRESSIVE THIRD PARTY AYE INVESTIGATORS FROM CHARGING UP FRONT FEES I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TESTIFIED AND I AM HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY QUESTION.

FOR VERY HUMBLE BEGINNINGS IN MERCED PROFESSOR OGLETREE EMBARKED ON A PROLIFIC CAREER FOCUSED ON THE ADVANCEMENT OF CIVIL RIGHTS RACIAL JUSTICE AND SOCIAL TOLERANCE. IN ADDITION TO HIS INFLUENTIAL WRITINGS IS A LEGAL SCHOLAR. PROFESSOR OGLETREE INSPIRED GENERATIONS OF LAW STUDENTS AS A PROFESSOR AT HARVARD INCLUDING. FORMER PRESIDENT AND FIRST LADY BARACK AND MICHELLE OBAMA. AS A PUBLIC DEFENDER AND CIVIL RIGHTS ATTORNEY PROFESSOR OGLETREE NOTABLY REPRESENTED SURVIVORS OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY ONE TULSA RACE MASSACRE AND ACTED AS LEGAL COUNSEL TO PROFESSOR ANITA HILL DURING THE CLARENCE THOMAS SENATE CONFIRMATION HEARINGS. HE RECEIVED COUNTLESS PRESTIGIOUS AWARDS THROUGHOUT HIS CAREER INCLUDING BEING NAMED ONE OF THE ONE HUNDRED MOST INFLUENTIAL LAWYERS IN AMERICA BY THE NATIONAL LAW JOURNAL.

WE'LL TAKE A MOTION ONCE WE GET A QUORUM. THANK YOU MR THANK YOU. HI THIS FRIEDMAN WILL NOW MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FIVE AB TWENTY THREE OH NINE. THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS AB TWENTY HIT THREE OH NINE STRENGTHENS EXISTING JUVENILE COURT PROCEDURES TO OFFER GUARDIANSHIP INSTEAD OF FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT AS MANY OF YOU KNOW I'VE DONE QUITE A BIT OF WORK COULD TO SUPPORT OUR FOSTER YOUTH SOME OF OUR MOST. VULNERABLE COMMUNITY MEMBERS OF THE EARLY STAGES OF A DEPENDENCY COURT CASE IN THE DAY AND WEEKS AFTER CHILD IS REMOVED FROM THEIR CARE IS CRITICAL. THESE HEARING COULD LEAVE EARLY COURT HEARING TO DETERMINE WHERE A CHILD WILL LIVE AND WHAT SERVICES THE FAMILY WILL RECEIVE FOR THE MONTHS AND SOMETIMES FOR THE YEARS TO COME. IT'S ALSO AT THIS EARLY STAGE THAT THE DISPROPORTIONATE REPRESENTATION OF FAMILIES OF COLOR IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IT MANIFESTS. JUVENILE COURTS HAVE DISCRETION INSTITUTIONS CODE SECTION THREE SIXTY EIGHT TO ORDER A SAFE AND PERMANENT GARTERS GUARDIANSHIP AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO FOSTER CARE PLACEMENT. THIS OPTION TYPICALLY ARISES UNDER SUCH A CERTAIN FACT PATTERNS NAMELY ONE APPARENT DECLINES OF FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES AFTER CONSULTATION WITH THEIR ATTORNEY. AND IDENTIFIES A FAMILY MEMBER OR OTHER KNOWN ADULT TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR CHILD FOR THEM. CALIFORNIA COURTS HAVE DESCRIBED THIS OPTION IS ONE OF THE LAST OPPORTUNITIES TO GIVE SOME DEFENSE TO THE PARENTS OWN PLAN FOR THEIR CHILD. AND TO KEEP THAT CHILD IN CONNECTION WITH OTHER FAMILY MEMBERS AND SOMETIMES THE FOSTER CARE PLACEMENTS MAKE THAT VERY DIFFICULT. BUT JUVENILE COURT STAKEHOLDERS REPORT THAT GUARDIANSHIP IN LIEU OF FOSTER CARE. ARE NOT CONSIDERED EVEN WHEN THAT OPTION WOULD BE IN THE BEST INTEREST OF THE CHILD AND THE FAMILY AT TIMES. COURTS ARE NOT REQUIRED TO CONSIDER THE PARENTS CHOICE OF A GUARDIAN AND TYPICALLY DO NOT CONSIDER GUARDIANSHIP UNTIL THE DISPOSITIONAL HEARING AFTER THE CHILD IS OFTEN BEEN PUT INTO FOSTER CARE AND SPEND TIME. THEIR FAMILY SOMETIMES FOR MONTHS AB TWENTY THREE OH NINE WOULD PROMOTE FAMILY DECISION MAKING I MINIMIZE A CHILD'S EXPOSURE TO THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM WHEN THERE'S A SAFE AND PERMANENT GUARDIAN AVAILABLE OF COURSE THAT. WOULD HAVE. PER SE CHILD'S. WELL BEING. THE BILL UPDATES THE LAW BY ALLOWING THE JUVENILE COURT ORDERED GUARDIANSHIP EARLIER IN THE DEPENDENT CORPORATE SAYS. AND ALSO REQUIRES A JUVENILE COURT TO SELECT THE PARENTS DESIGNATED GUARDIAN. AS LONG AS THE CHILD SAFETY IS NOT JEOPARDIZED AT THIS POINT WHEN A PARENT UNDERSTANDS THAT FOR WHATEVER REASON THEY CAN'T PARENT THAT CHILD. WE SHOULD BE LISTENING TO THEIR VIEWS ABOUT WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR FAMILY AND FOR THAT CHILD. THE BILL ALSO REQUIRES DSS TO COLLECT DATA ON CHILDREN LIVING WITH RELATIVE CAREGIVERS THE INDIVIDUALS WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO BECOME GUARDIANS UNDER THIS BILL. WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH YOUR STAFF AND WITH STAKEHOLDERS AS WE REFINE THE BILL AND I RESPECTFULLY REQUEST YOUR AYE VOTE TODAY THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

WE GATHER DATA FROM THROUGHOUT THE STATE SHOWING THAT ALTHOUGH THE CARE GIVERS AND THE CHILDREN THEY CARE FOR HAVE SIMILAR TRAUMATIC EXPERIENCES AND COMPLEX NEEDS FOR DECISIONS MADE EARLY IN THE FAMILY'S INVOLVEMENT WITH CHILD WELFARE CAN CREATE SIGNIFICANT DISPARITIES.

TWENTY ONE FIFTY NINE. WHAT GOOD MORNING THIS COULD BE BACK WITH YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS- HERE TO PRESENT A TWO ONE FIFTEEN A BILL WOULD STOP PERMANENT FAMILY SEPARATION THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM. FOR PARENTS WERE PRE TRIAL MEANING THEY'RE NOT THEY'VE NOT BEEN CONVICTED OF ANY WRONGDOING. I WANNA CHAU PROTECTIVE SERVICE CASES OPEN IN A CHILD IS PLACED IN FOSTER CARE CBS IS REQUIRED TO ASSESS ELIGIBILITY FOR ALL PARENTS FOR REUNIFICATION SERVICES. THEY'RE ALSO REQUIRED TO BEGIN ASSISTING THAT PARENT WITH THE PROCESS OF REUNITING WITH THEIR CHILD. FOR PARENTS IN CUSTODY THIS COULD INCLUDE AN INVESTIGATING WHAT SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE AT THE PLACE WHERE SOMEBODY'S INCARCERATED A SERVICES IN A SERVICES ANGER MANAGEMENT. LIFE SKILLS. IN ADDITION A FORM TO SUPPORT. WITHIN SIXTY DAYS OF FILING A CHILD WELFARE CASE TO JUVENILE DEPENDENCY COURT MUST DECIDE WHETHER THEY'RE GOING TO ORDER THE PARENT AND TO BE INFORMATION SERVICES. OR IF THEY SHOULD BE BYPASS FOR THE SERVICES. BECAUSE THEY FIT INTO ONE OF THE CRITERIA BEING DENIED FOR REUNIFICATION. IF BOTH PARENTS ARE BY PASSED THE COURT WILL SET A HEARING MAKE A PERMIT PLAN FOR THE CHILD WHICH COULD LEAD TO THE TERMINATION. OF PARENTAL RIGHTS FOREVER. IN CALIFORNIA THERE ARE SEVENTEEN DIFFERENT BY PRESS PROVISIONS CURRENTLY. THE PROBLEM THIS BILL WILL FIX. IS IN A SEPARATION PROVISION THAT CURRENTLY STATES THAT IF YOU ARE A PARENT. WHO IS INCARCERATED AND NOT CONVICTED OF A CRIME IN YOUR SIMPLY PRE TRIAL AND YOU COULD NOT HAVE AFFORDED YOUR BAIL. YOU CAN STILL BE BYPASS FOR FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES. WE HAVE TO FIX THIS THE DO POST BAIL. AND ARE GOING TO THE SAME UNIFICATION PROCESS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE POSSIBILITY OF BEING DENIED THEIR REUNIFICATION SERVICES. FOR YEARS WE HAVE FUMBLED THE BALL IN THE STATE LEGISLATOR ON PRE TRIAL REFORM BUT IN THE MEANTIME THERE ARE COUNTLESS CHILDREN WHO ARE FALLING THROUGH THE CRACKS. ADDING ADDITIONAL STRAIN TOWARD TRAVEL FOR INFRASTRUCTURE AND BEING DENIED REUNIFICATION SERVICES WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND WE KNOW THE BLACK BROWN POINT INDIGENOUS FAMILIES ARE DISPROPORTIONATELY IMPACTED BY ALL OF THE ABOVE. AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY NINE WILL ENSURE THAT PARENTS WERE PRE TRIAL WILL NOT BE DENIED FAMILY REUNIFICATION SERVICES SOLELY BECAUSE THEY ARE TOO POOR TO POST A BAIL. PARENTS WERE CONVICTED OF WRONGDOING BY THE WAY ARE STILL BY PASSED FOR THOSE REUNIFICATION SERVICES TO THE SIMPLY APPLIES TO PARENTS WHO ARE PRE TRIAL.

YES THANK YOU OUR FIRST I WANTED TO THANK THE COMMITTEE CHAIRED MEMBERS ALL THE TIME OR GET. MY NAME IS JULIE HENEGHAN AND I AM A POLICY DIRECTOR FOR DEPENDENCY LEGAL SERVICES. WHEN I WAS PREPARING TO ADDRESS THIS COMMITTEE I SPOKE TO ONE OF OUR CONTRACT ATTORNEYS. WHO TOLD ME ABOUT HIS CLIENT WELCOME NUMBER. TWO MONTHS AGO AND I THOUGHT SHE WAS GOING ON A DATE WITH HER BOYFRIEND SHE KNEW THIS MAN AS HE IS THE FATHER OF HER TWO YOUNG CHILDREN. BUT SHE DID NOT KNOW THAT ON THIS PARTICULAR DAY HER BOYFRIEND WAS GOING TO COMMIT. A SERIOUS FELONY. GIVEN THAT AMBER WAS IN THE CAR SHE TOO HAS BEEN CHARGED WITH FIFTEEN FELONIES. THE CRIMINAL COURT COURT IS HOLDING HER WITHOUT BAIL CPS REMOVED HER TWO CHILDREN. AS WE SIT HERE TODAY AMBER IS INNOCENT UNTIL PROVEN GUILTY OF CRIMINAL CHARGES ARE PENDING AND MAY NOT BE RESOLVED FOR MONTHS. AMBER IS ALSO A PERSON OF COLOR AS ARE MANY OF THE CLIENTS MISTER. IN TWO DAYS FROM TODAY A JUVENILE DEPENDENCY JUDGE IS GOING TO TELL AMBER THAT SHE WILL NEVER BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO GET HER CHILDREN BACK. CURRENT LAW PROVIDES AT CBS AND THE COURT HAS THE ABILITY TO MAKE THIS DECISION. AND DOES SO WITH GREAT FREQUENCY THAT COURTS CANNOT DENY FAMILIES THE OPPORTUNITY TO REUNIFY WITH THEIR CHILDREN. UNTIL OR UNLESS THE PARENT IS CONVICTED OF THE CRIME FOR WHICH THEY ARE INCARCERATED. REMEMBER THIS BILL WILL BE TOO LATE. AFTER THURSDAY THE COURT WITH A HEARING IN JULY TO TURN. TO TERMINATE HER PARENTAL RIGHTS. IF CHARGES ARE DROPPED OR NEGOTIATED AN AMBER IS RELEASED BEFORE THEN SHE WILL STILL HAVE TO PROVE WHY IT IS IN HER CHILDREN'S BEST INTERESTS SHOULD BE GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO YOU KNOW. AND IT'S LIKELY OUR COURTS. EVEN GIVE HER HEARING BEFORE THANK. IF THE CHARGES ARE DROPPED OR SHE IS RELEASED IN AUGUST OR AFTERWARDS HER CHILDREN WILL ALREADY HAVE BEEN FREE FOR ADOPTION AND SHE WILL HAVE ABSOLUTELY NO LEGAL RECOURSE. OUR CALIFORNIA STATE SUPREME COURT ONE THROAT THERE IS NO GO TO JAIL THAT YOUR KIDS WILL IN CALIFORNIA. FOLLOWING MANY WAYS OUR SYSTEM DOES NOT LIVE UP TO THIS PROVINCE AB TWENTY ONE FIFTY NINE WILL GO A LONG WAY TOWARD GIVING FAMILIES A TO TAKE. ADVANTAGE OF SERVICES DESIGNED TO HELP THEM IT WILL ALLOW PARENTS IN CUSTODY PRIOR TO TRIAL HAVE THE SAME OPPORTUNITY HAS THOSE WHO ARE OUT ON BAIL. THE OPPORTUNITY TO ATTEMPT TO FIX THE PROBLEMS THAT REUNITE WITH THEIR CHILDREN. WE ASK FOR YOUR HELP. THANK YOU. THEN CRISTINA CURTIS. THANK YOU GOOD MORNING MY NAME IS CHRISTINA CURTIS AND I AM A SUPERVISING ATTORNEY WITH THE LAW OFFICE OF THE TENNESSEE LAWYERS AND THE COACH OUR CULTURE LEGISLATIVE COMMITTEE FOR BOTH LOS ANGELES THE PENALTY LAWYER IN SAN DIEGO LEGAL SERVICES. LOS ANGELES COUNTY HAS THE BIGGEST CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM IN THE UNITED STATES SO IN PREPARATION FOR MY TESTIMONY TODAY. I WAS CONFIDENT I'D BE ABLE TO PROVIDE THAT PERFECT WITNESS TO GIVE THAT SYMPATHETIC STORY TO SHARE WITH YOU. HOWEVER I DO NOT HAVE ONE. NOT BECAUSE IT SHOULD NOT A PROBLEM THE ONE. THE BECAUSE THE PROBLEM IS SO PREVALENT. MOST OF OUR ATTORNEYS HAVE REPRESENTED AN INCARCERATED PARENT AWAITING TRIAL WHO HAD BEEN BY PASSED BY THIS PROVISION HOWEVER BY THE TIME A CLIENT IN THE QUITTED FOR THE CRIMES THEY WERE CHARGED WITH THE DAMAGE AS LONG BEEN DONE. IT IS IMPORTANT TO NOTE HERE HOW THE TIMELINE TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE ONE APPARENTLY BY PASSED. COMPARED TO THE TIMELINE TO CONCLUDE A CRIMINAL CASE. WHERE THE CRIMINAL CASE CAN AT TIMES TAKE OVER A YEAR TO PROSECUTE. WHEN A PARENT OF BY PASSED POINT A RIGHT TO BE TERMINATED AND THE CHILD FREED FOR ADOPTION AND IS LITTLE IN SIX MONTHS FROM INITIATION. OF THE DEPENDENCY CASE. THIS MEANS THAT BY THE TIME A PARENT BEEN ACQUITTED FOR THE CRIME CHARGED THEIR CHILD IS LIKELY COMPLETED FOR ADOPTION AND OUR TIME FOR APPEAL HAS LONG PASSED. THIS LAW AS IT CURRENTLY% STANDS ALSO HAS AN EVEN WIDER IMPLICATIONS THAN JUST AFFECTING APPEARANCE RIGHT TO PARENT THEIR CHILDREN. IT CAN BE USED AS A BARGAINING CHIP TO ENCOURAGE A PERSON IN CUSTODY. ENTER A PLEA IN A CRIMINAL CASE RATHER THAN GO TO TRIAL TO DEFEND THEIR INTENT. AFTER ALL A PERSON MAY BE WILLING TO SACRIFICE TIME IN JAIL TO PROVE THEIR INNOCENCE. BUT IF IT MEANS THAT THEY COULD PROBABLY LOSE CUSTODY OF THEIR CHILDREN. DOING WHATEVER IS NECESSARY TO GET OUT OF JAIL SINCE MUCH MORE IMPORTANT. AMONG OTHER THINGS CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS AFFECT A PERSON'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN EMPLOYMENT. AND SOME CONVICTIONS PREVENT PERSONS FROM BEING ABLE TO SELL. TO BE CLEAR. PROP BY AND LARGE. PARENTS YOU CAN AFFORD BAIL. THE GREAT MANS WHO COULD AFFORD BILL WILL ABSOLUTELY BE GIVEN A CHANCE TO GET THEIR CHILDREN BACK IN THE CARE TO REUNIFICATION START. BUT APPARENTLY CANNOT. RISK HAVING THEIR CHILDREN PLAY PRODUCTION AND LIGHTING. ALTHOUGH THE LAW WAS CREATED WITHOUT THE CONTENT AFTER THE FINANCE WELFARE INSTITUTION'S CODE THREE SIXTY ONE POINT FIVE HE CONTINUES TO MARGINALIZE ALREADY MARGINALIZED FAMILIES BUT PERMANENTLY REMOVING CHILDREN FROM THEIR CARE. THIS IS WHY AB TWENTY FIFTH TWENTY ONE FIFTY NINE IT'S SO IMPORTANT. IT IS THE FIRST STEP. FORWARD SOLVENT FAIR TREATMENT A FAMILY THE CHILD WELFARE.

HUNDRED FIFTY FOSTER SIBLINGS I'VE SEEN THE RIGHTS TERMINATED IN THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN LOSE CUSTODY OF YOUR CHILDREN FOREVER BECAUSE YOU WERE TOO POOR TO POST BAIL EVEN FOR CHARGES FOR WHICH YOU WERE EVENTUALLY ACQUITTED OR HAD DROPPED IS UNCONSCIONABLE ESPECIALLY FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO I'M PROUD TO HAVE AUTHORED THIS BILL IN A REQUEST FOR THE ACTUAL ADULT.

HE WAS HIDING BUT WILL MOVE TO ITEM NUMBER FOUR AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR MISTER GIBSON WELFARE THANK YOU. FOR. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT. ASSEMBLY BILL SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR WHICH SEEKS TO ALLOW CHILDREN. AND YOUNG ADULTS A CHANCE TO SAFELY UNDERSCORE SAFELY CONNECT WITH THEIR FAMILIES AND COMMUNITIES. SPECIFICALLY THIS BILL WOULD DO A FEW THINGS. ENSURE POST ADOPTION CONTRACTS TO CONTINUE VISITATIONS BETWEEN SIBLINGS. ARE SIBLINGS ARE ADDRESSED- PRIOR TO TERMINATION OF PARENTAL RIGHTS. ENSURE SIBLINGS VISITATIONS CONTINUES PAST THE END OF PARENTAL RIGHTS. CLARIFY THE ADULTS SIBLINGS EVEN IF PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED OUR VIEW AS SIBLINGS UNDER THE LAW REQUIRES THAT THE OLDER SIBLINGS IN FOSTER CARE BE GIVEN NOTICE OF ANY PLANS OF ADOPTION OF THEIR YOUNGER SIBLINGS AND ALLOW PARENTAL RIGHTS TO BE REINSTATED FOR NON MINERS IN FOSTER CARE AFTER ADOPTION. HAS FAILED. THROUGH THE COBIT NINETEEN CRISIS CHILDREN AND YOUNG ADULTS CONTINUE TO STAY BECAUSE TO STATES THAT SAY. THEY WANT TO BE CONNECTED TO THEIR COMMUNITIES EXPRESSLY SIBLINGS WHO NEEDS THEIR OTHER SIBLINGS FOR SUPPORT IT IS HARD TO IMAGINE BEING WITHOUT THE BOND. DOING WHAT WE CAN WHEN WE CAN IS THE START OF A BETTER FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IN THIS STATE. NEARLY ONE HUNDRED TIMES A DAY A CHILD IN CALIFORNIA IS PLACED IN FOSTER CARE. JUST IMAGINE THAT THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY ALONE HAS OVER THIRTY THREE THOUSAND. FOSTER YOUTH AND IT MAKES SENSE FOR CHILDREN WHO WANT TO LIVE WITH THEIR BIRTH PARENTS TO HAVE AN OPTION TO KEEP FAMILIES CONNECTED. IN SOME CASES THE ADOPTION FAILS AND THE CHILDREN HAS TO RE ESTABLISH RELATIONSHIP WITH THEIR PARENTS. HOWEVER THE STRUCTURE THE STRUCTURE TO SUPPORT THIS PROCESS IS LACKING WHEN FOSTER YOU TERMINATES TERM TERMS OUT OF THE SYSTEM THEY ARE LEFT WITHOUT RESOURCES. HAVING FAMILY CONNECTION DURING THIS TIME TO PROVIDE SUPPORT AS A MEMBER OF THE SELECT CMMITTEE ON NATIVE AMERICAN AFFAIRS I AM ALSO AWARE OF THE CRISIS WITH THE NATIVE AMERICAN FOSTER YOUTH THE CRISIS IS SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE AFRICAN AMERICAN COMMUNITY AND THE LATINO COMMUNITY. FAMILY CULTURE CONNECTION MATTERS. AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR STRENGTHEN FAMILIES CONNECTION. EVERY CHILD DESERVES RELATIONSHIP EVERY CHILD DESERVES TO FEEL SAFE. ONCE IT LOVED AND HEARD BY THE COMMUNITIES THEY IDENTIFY AND FOSTER COMMUNITY AND FOSTER COMMUNITY CONNECTIONS AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR MEMBERS PROVIDE A PATH FORWARD FOR THESE FAMILIES. JOINING ME TO PROVIDE SUPPORTING TESTIMONY. IS MEREDITH ALEXANDER WITH THE CALIFORNIA LAWCENTER AN OLD LET ME ALSO PAUSE TO SAY WE ALSO QUEUED UP TO YOU TO BE WITH US BUT THEY WERE NOT ABLE TO BECAUSE THEY'RE IN COURT FOR THE SAME REASON FIGHTING. FOR THE RIGHTS. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON SO I DO HAVE ONE WITNESS LISTED MEREDITH ALEXANDER OF THE CHILDREN'S LAWCENTER WITH US ON THE TELEPHONE. ALEXANDER ARE YOU WITH US. YES I'M HERE GO AHEAD PLEASE AT FIRST I WANT TO THANK YOU FIRST I WANT TO THINK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON FOR OFFERING THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN FAMILY CONNECTIONS AND ULTIMATELY FOSTER BETTER OUTCOMES FOR YOUTH INVOLVED IN THE CHILD WELFARE SYSTEM I'M MEREDITH ALEXANDER AN ATTORNEY SUPERVISOR AT THE CHILDREN'S LAW CENTER OF CALIFORNIA. I WAS PREVIOUSLY A CATERING ATTORNEY FOR CLC REPRESENTING CHILDREN IN DEPENDENCY COURT DALY AND BEFORE JOINING CLC I WORKED IN FAMILY LAW. DOT THE LARGEST CHILDREN'S LEGAL SERVICES ORGANIZATION IN THE NATION ADVOCATING FOR OVER THIRTY FIVE THOUSAND CHILDREN AND YOUTH IN FOSTER CARE. IN LOS ANGELES SACRAMENTO. AND PLASTER COUNTY EACH YEAR. IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM IF A CHILD CANNOT SAFELY BE REUNIFIED WITH THEIR FAMILY ADOPTION IS THE PREFERRED PLAN. PERMANENT IS CRITICAL FOR OUR CLIENTS BUT THERE'S ALSO A GROWING RECOGNITION THAT FOR MANY ADOPTEES IT IS ALSO CRITICAL TO MAINTAIN SOME CONNECTION TO THEIR BIOLOGICAL FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. AND THAT MAINTAINING THESE CONNECTIONS CAN OFTEN BE SPACE AND PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT BENEFIT. I'VE SEEN IN NUMEROUS CASES THAT WHILE ADOPTION CAN BRING GREAT JOY THERE CAN ALSO BE A SIGNIFICANT GRIEF AND LOSS WHEN A CHILD IS PERMANENTLY CUT FROM ALL CONNECTION TO THEIR FAMILY AND COMMUNITY. RESEARCH ESEARCH SHOWS THE SIBLING BOND IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IN MITIGATING THE TRAUMA OF FAMILY SEPARATION. FEEDBACK WE HEAR FROM OUR CLIENTS HAS REINFORCED THE VERACITY OF THIS RESEARCH. WELL THE IMPORTANCE OF MAINTAINING SIBLING CONNECTIONS POST ADOPTION IS ALREADY RECOGNIZED IN THE LAW BY REQUIRING CHILD WELFARE AGENCIES TO SET UP A MEETING TO EXECUTE OPPOSED ADOPTION CONTRACT WHEN PRACTICABLE. IN PRACTICE WE RARELY SEE THESE MEETINGS TAKE PLACE AND TOO OFTEN WE SEE OUR CLIENTS WITH ALL CONTACT WITH THEIR SIBLINGS RESULTING IN TRAUMA THAT CAN LAST WELL INTO ADULTHOOD. THIS BILL WOULD STRENGTHEN THE EXISTING LAW TO ENSURE THESE MEETINGS TO TAKE PLACE TO DISCUSS THE POSSIBILITY OF POSTED OPTION CONTACT BETWEEN SIBLINGS. ADDITIONALLY THIS BILL WILL CREATE PATHWAYS TO REINSTATE PARENTAL RIGHTS FOR USE WHEN IT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE AND IN THEIR BEST INTEREST. I URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT LEGISLATION AND AGAIN THANK ASSEMBLY MEMBER GIPSON FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND STRENGTHENING CALIFORNIA FAMILIES. THANK YOU THANK YOU. RIGHT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR. SEEING NONE OPERATOR WOULD YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT TO AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR PLEASE PRESS ONE ZERO AT THIS TIME. WE DO HOPE SOMEONE QUEUING UP ONE MOMENT WHILE WE GATHER THE INFORMATION. WE'LL START WITH LINE NUMBER TWENTY SIX POINT TWENTY SIX PLEASE GO AHEAD. THIS IS MOLLY SHANNON WHAT THE CALIFORNIA CATHOLIC CONFERENCE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS BILL THANK YOU SO MUCH. I'M ACTUALLY AT LINE TWENTY FOUR GO AHEAD PLEASE. THIS IS JOHN DIDN'T GO WITH THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF SOCIAL WORKES CALIFORNIA CHAPTER IN STRONG SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR WE HAVE NO FURTHER COMMENT USING KEEP. THANK YOU I DO NOT HAVE ANY OPPOSITION LISTED WHAT IS THERE ANYONE IN THE HEARING ROOM I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION OF AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR. SEEING NONE OPERATORS YOU OPEN THE LINES FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TO AB SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR.

BACK TO THE COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS. THANK YOU WE DO HAVE A MOTION AS THEIR SECOND. AND A SECOND THANK YOU THIS GIPSON THANK YOU FOR BRINGING THIS FORWARD AND YOU MAY CLOSE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AS I WAS FIRST OF ALL I WISH THE TWO WHO WERE GOING TO BE SCARED TO BE HERE THE VERY VERY BEST IN COURT TODAY. I'M REMINDED OF A YOUNG MAN WHO- WAS SEPARATED- IN THE SAN GABRIEL AREA- HE HIS BROTHER HIS BIOLOGICAL BROTHER- AND HIS CELL THE SIBLINGS WERE SEPARATED BUT AS BIOLOGICAL BROTHER LIVE FIVE BLOCKS FROM WHERE HE LIVED GOING TO CONNECT THEM. THIS WAS THREE YEARS AGO. AND THE DAY BEFORE. THEY WERE GOING TO BE CONNECTED. HIS BROTHER WAS KILLED. AND THEY NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO CREATE A BOND THEY NEVER GOT A CHANCE TO- TO SEE WHETHER NOT EACH OTHER HAVE THE SAME COLOR HAT MANNERISMS OF THEIR PARENTAL- PARENTS. THIS IS A COMMON SENSE BILL SEVENTEEN NINETY FOUR THAT STRENGTH IS A PROCESS. THAT WOULD PUBLIC FAMILY CONNECTIONS FOR DOBSON'S AND WENT UP WHEN APPROPRIATE THIS BILL SUPPORT- CONTACT BETWEEN SIBLINGS AND SAFE AND IN A SAFE WAY AND ALLOW A BETTER PATH FOR PARENTAL RIGHTS. TO BE REINSTATED FOR CHILDREN IN FOSTER CARE AND ADOPTION LET ME SIMPLY SAY THIS OF A CLOSE I NEVER BEEN IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. NEVER BEEN ADOPTED BUT MY HEART GOES OUT AND IT'S THIS IS MY OPPORTUNITY TO STAND UP BUT THOSE WHO CANNOT STAND UP FOR THEMSELVES I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU VERY MUCH. THANK YOU MISTER GIBSON WE DO HAVE A MOTION AND SECOND THAT MOTIONS TO PASS TO HUMAN SERVICES KALRA PLEASE STONE AYE STONE AYE. CUNNINGHAM. CUNNINGHAM I. DAVIES.AB I HOLDEN HOLDEN I KALRA. KILEY MAIENSCHEIN PARK MAIENSCHEIN AYE REYES REYES HI RIVAS. RIVAS THANK YOU THE BILLS OUT THANK YOU SO MUCH THANK YOU. EXIST TO OUR ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT MISTER CUNNINGHAM. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. YOUR PRESENT AB SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT TODAY HUMAN TRAFFICKING AS WE ALL KNOW IS THE WORLD'S FASTEST GROWING CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE IT'S ESTIMATED TO BE A HUNDRED AND FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR A YEAR INDUSTRY ADDITIONALLY HOTELS AND MOTELS WERE THE THIRD MOST COMMON VENUE FOR SEX TRAFFICKING IN TWENTY NINETEEN AND HAVE ROUTINELY BEEN IN THE TOP THREE VENUES SINCE TWENTY THIRTEEN. A RECENT STUDY BY THE POLARIS PROJECT FOUND THAT 75% OF SURVIVORS REPORTED COMING INTO CONTACT WITH HOTELS OR MOTELS AT SOME POINT DURING THEIR TRAFFICKING SITUATION. WHAT SEVENTEEN EIGHTY EIGHT WOULD DO IS ALLOW FOR THE FIRST TIME. CITY ATTORNEYS AND DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO BRING CIVIL ACTIONS AGAINST HOTELS AND MOTELS. ONLY IN CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE SUPERVISING EMPLOYEE NEW OR ACTED WITH WITH RECKLESS DISREGARD. TO SEX TRAFFICKING HAPPENING ON THE PREMISES. THE BILL CREATES A SAFE HARBOR FROM LIABILITY IF ANY EMPLOYEE REPORTS THE ACTIVITY TO EITHER LAW ENFORCEMENT THE NATIONAL TRAFFICKING HOTLINE OR ANOTHER APPROPRIATE VICTIM SERVICES CENTER. THIS ILL BUILDS ON THE WORK THIS LEGISLATURE IN THIS COMMITTEE HAS DONE BACK IN TWENTY EIGHTEEN WE PASSED SB NINE SEVENTY- SENATOR ATKINS THE REQUIRES HOSPITALITY EMPLOYEES TO RECEIVE TRAFFICKING TRAINING TO HELP IDENTIFY THE SIGNS OF TRAFFICKING I THINK THIS IS A LOGICAL NEXT STEP TO CREATE INCENTIVE TO ACTUALLY HAVE THIS ACTIVITY REPORTED TO. THE AUTHORITIES TO THE HOTLINE OR TO VICTIM SERVICES CENTER. IMPORTANT NOTE THAT UNDER FEDERAL LAW THE FEDERAL TRAFFICKING VICTIMS PROTECTION ACT. ALLOWS FEDERAL PROSECUTORS. OR VICTIMS TO BRING CIVIL OR CRIMINAL ACTIONS AGAINST HOTELS BUT IT HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER UTILIZED AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WE SEE. AS YOU MIGHT EXPECT THE CRIMINAL ACTIVITY BEING BROUGHT AGAINST INTERNATIONAL CARTELS AND SO FORTH- BUT THERE'S NO REMEDY FOR A LOCAL DISTRICT ATTORNEY OR CITY ATTORNEY. WHO'S MORE LIKELY TO KNOW THAT THE ACTIVITIES GOING ON IN THE COMMUNITY AND HAS THE RESOURCES TO ADDRESS IT AT THE LOCAL LEVEL- BY ALLOWING THIS WILL CLOSE THE GAP AND GIVE. LOCAL ATTORNEYS ANOTHER TOOL TO COMBAT TRAFFICKING IN THEIR COMMUNITY. HERE WITH ME TODAY IS CAN STONE WITH CDA TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU I DO HAVE THE ONE WITNESS LISTED. GO AHEAD GOOD MORNING KIM STONE OF STONE ADVOCACY REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION. AS YOU ALL KNOW HUMAN TRAFFICKING CONTINUES IT'S A GROWING PROBLEM IT'S A VICIOUS PROBLEM AND IT DESERVES CREATIVE SOLUTIONS. LIKE THIS BILL OFFERS. THE CIVIL PENALTIES THAT WOULD BE AFFORDED IS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL FOR DISTRICT ATTORNEYS TO PROSECUTE. HUMAN TRAFFICKING CASES WILL INCENTIVIZE HOTEL SUPERVISORY EMPLOYEES TO REPORT- IF THEY BELIEVE OR SUSPECT HUMAN TRAFFICKING IS HAPPENING AT THAT PROCESS. AND THE AMENDMENTS WILL PROVIDE PROTECTION TO WELL INTENTIONED AND TELL EMPLOYEES FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING. THAT CALIFORNIA DISTRICT ATTORNEYS ASSOCIATION ENTHUSIASTICALLY SUPPORTS THE BILL AND URGES YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU AND SPEAKING OF AMENDMENTS ARE AMENDMENTS YOU'RE TAKING THOSE AUTHORS OF ADMITS YES THANK YOU YEAH THANK YOU.

TO RESPOND TO HUMAN TRAFFICKING. ANTI TRAFFICKING ORGAN TAT AS THE CALL TOOK THE ANTI. I'VE CALLED FOR PUBLIC HEALTH APPROACHES TO RESPOND HUMAN TRAFFICKING. WELL THE BILL ALLOWS CALLING CUTS ORGANIZATION AND LONGER THAN FARMING MON FORCE MEANT AS LISTED AS ONE OF THE OPTIONS. TO ESCAPE LIABILITY RESTS ABOUT WILL SEEM LIKE THE EASIEST COLOR TO MAKE PROFOUND HOTEL. AND AT THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS NOTES THERE ARE MET TO MONEY RIGHT. TO NOTIFY LAW ENFORCEMENT RATHER THAN ORGANIZATIONS. CHANGE RESPONSE AND HUMAN TRAFFICKING INCLUDING FAILING TO CONNECT TOPIC IN VICTIMS NEEDED RESOURCES POTENTIALLY TRAUMATIZING VICTIMS AND RAISING FEARS THE COURT FOR IMMIGRANTS.

BEING THERE TO HELP THEM AND GIVEN THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACTUALLY GET HELP AND GET OUT THEY WON'T BE THERE SO I THINK HAVING ALL OF THE GROUPS IN HERE IT'S ERY IMPORTANT AND FOR THAT I WOULD ON.

THANK YOU WAS CUNNINGHAM THANK YOU FOR WORKING WITH THE COMMITTEE ON THIS AND TAKING THE AMENDMENTS I UNDERSTAND THE OPPOSITION'S CONCERNS HERE BUT BUT I THINK THAT IN THESE SITUATIONS AND WITH THAT THE NARROWING THAT WE'VE DONE I THINK WE HAVE AN APPROPRIATE BILL FOR. PASSING OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE. THANK YOU MISTERCHAIR. SO I COULD ADDRESS THE OPPOSITION ARGUMENT MY CLOTHES. THAT'S PER YES YOU MAY- I JUST WANTED TO CLARIFY SOMETHING. THE SAFE HARBOR KICKS IN IT THERE'S THREE OPTIONS FOR PEOPLE TO REPORT THIS UNDER THE BILL AS AMENDED THEY CAN EITHER. DO LAW ENFORCEMENT IF THAT'S APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES- SAY THEY WITNESSED SOMETHING VIOLENT YOU WOULD WANT THEM TO CALL NINE ONE ONE WANT THE WANT LAW ENFORCEMENT TO BE INVOLVED TO DE ESCALATE SITUATION- YOU DON'T WANT THE TROUBLE WE'RE HAVING AND WE'RE WORKING THROUGH IT WITH THE ACLU I THINK WE'RE- WE'RE- WE'RE IMPROVING THE BILL AS WE GO- YOU DON'T WANT A SITUATION WHERE SOMEBODY WITNESSES SOMETHING VIOLENT. THAT IS TRAFFICKING RELATED THEY CALL NINE ONE ONE APPROPRIATELY BUT NOBODY CALLS THE TIP LINE OR THE VICTIM SERVICES CENTER AND ALL THE SUDDEN. THE HOTEL OR MOTELS EXPOSED TO LIABILITY THAT'S WHY THERE'S NO MANDATE THAT YOU CALL LAW ENFORCEMENT IN THE BILL AS AMENDED YOU CAN CALL EITHER OF THOSE THREE OPTIONS OUR HOPE IS THAT THE FIRST CALL. IF THERE'S NO VIOLENCE GOING ON WOULD BE TO THE TIP LINE OR WOULD BE TO THE VICTIM SERVICES CENTER- I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING. THE IT LINKS UP WITH THE TRAINING THAT THEY'RE DOING UNDER NINE SEVENTY SO I THINK IT MAKES SENSE- BUT I'M GONNA CONTINUE WORKING WITH THE ACLU. AND PUT HAS BEEN.
