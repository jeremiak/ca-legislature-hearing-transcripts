THEY.

00:25:06.705 --> 00:25:12.277 region:rollup2
A MEASURE OF FUNCTIONALITY HOW.

00:25:09.274 --> 00:25:13.746 region:rollup2
AS SPECIFIC TO INTAKE I'M IN

00:25:12.277 --> 00:25:15.814 region:rollup2
TERMS OF SNAPSHOT I'M WHAT WE

CALL SNAPSHOT AND THAT IS AN

00:25:15.814 --> 00:25:21.186 region:rollup2
ELASTIC SEARCH FUNCTION. THAT

00:25:17.616 --> 00:25:23.088 region:rollup2
ALLOWS USERS TO BE ABLE TO RUN

00:25:21.186 --> 00:25:24.656 region:rollup2
SEARCHES MUCH MORE QUICKLY THAN

THE EXISTING. CASE MANAGEMENT

00:25:24.656 --> 00:25:26.759 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:25:26.525 --> 00:25:29.128 region:rollup2

WHICH IS PART OF THE CONTINUUM

00:25:54.987 --> 00:25:59.024 region:rollup2
OF CARE REFORM. WE CONTINUE TO

SERVICES.

00:26:00.626 --> 00:26:04.563 region:rollup2
ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE HAVE

00:26:02.161 --> 00:26:06.565 region:rollup2
ALSO DONE IS WE HAVE BEEN FACED

00:26:04.563 --> 00:26:08.300 region:rollup2
WITH SOME MEASURE OF CHALLENGES

00:26:06.565 --> 00:26:10.069 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO BE ABLE DELIVER.

00:26:08.300 --> 00:26:11.570 region:rollup2
WORKING CODE ON A CONSISTENT

00:26:10.069 --> 00:26:13.405 region:rollup2
BASIS SO ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:26:11.570 --> 00:26:14.640 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING IN ORDER TO MAKE

00:26:13.405 --> 00:26:16.275 region:rollup2
SURE THAT WE ARE ABLE TO DO THAT

00:26:14.640 --> 00:26:16.875 region:rollup2
IS WE'VE HAD.

00:26:16.275 --> 00:26:17.976 region:rollup2
SEVERAL ASSESSMENTS THAT HAVE

00:26:16.875 --> 00:26:19.144 region:rollup2
BEEN DONE.

00:26:17.976 --> 00:26:21.046 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN WORKING IN CLOSE

DEPARTMENT OF TECHNOLOGY.

00:26:22.881 --> 00:26:25.651 region:rollup2
IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT WE

00:26:24.016 --> 00:26:28.353 region:rollup2
HAVE THAT CAPABILITY IS WHAT WE

00:26:25.651 --> 00:26:29.721 region:rollup2
CALL MORE BUILDING THE FACTORY.

00:26:28.353 --> 00:26:30.856 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE

00:26:29.721 --> 00:26:32.758 region:rollup2
THAT WE NEED IN ORDER TO BE ABLE

00:26:30.856 --> 00:26:33.659 region:rollup2
TO RELEASE THAT CODE.

00:26:32.758 --> 00:26:35.627 region:rollup2
TO THE WORKERS ON THAT ERROR

00:26:33.659 --> 00:26:36.562 region:rollup2
BRACED BASIS.

00:26:35.627 --> 00:26:38.997 region:rollup2
SO WE HAVE.

00:26:36.562 --> 00:26:41.066 region:rollup2
UNDER WAY UP A LOT OF TECHNICAL

00:26:38.997 --> 00:26:42.968 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS TO THAT PIPELINE

00:26:41.066 --> 00:26:44.837 region:rollup2
SAID THAT WE HAVE AUTOMATED

00:26:42.968 --> 00:26:46.538 region:rollup2
PROPAGATION OF ENVIRONMENTS.

00:26:44.837 --> 00:26:48.807 region:rollup2
AUTOMATED TESTING AND BEING ABLE

00:26:46.538 --> 00:26:50.742 region:rollup2
TO FACILITATE.

00:26:48.807 --> 00:26:52.945 region:rollup2
THE DELIVERY OF THAT CODE.%

00:26:50.742 --> 00:26:54.546 region:rollup2
SO I'M ONE OF THE THINGS THAT

00:26:52.945 --> 00:26:54.746 region:rollup2
YOU'LL NOTE IN THE AGENDA IS

00:26:54.546 --> 00:26:57.082 region:rollup2

PEOPLE THAT NEED IT.

00:27:11.263 --> 00:27:14.166 region:rollup2
GREAT.

00:27:12.631 --> 00:27:16.802 region:rollup2
BERMAN FINANCE.

00:27:14.166 --> 00:27:17.436 region:rollup2
ELIOT.

00:27:16.802 --> 00:27:18.804 region:rollup2
I DON'T THAT'S WHAT I LOOK AT

00:27:17.436 --> 00:27:20.305 region:rollup2
THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE

00:27:18.804 --> 00:27:21.840 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE PARTICULAR ISSUES

00:27:20.305 --> 00:27:23.208 region:rollup2
TO RAISE FOR THE COMMITTEE ON

00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:24.276 region:rollup2
THE PROJECTS WITHIN OVERSIZE

00:27:23.208 --> 00:27:25.711 region:rollup2
PORTFOLIO THAT ARE DISCUSSED

00:27:24.276 --> 00:27:27.880 region:rollup2
HERE. BUT JUST AS NOTED IN THE

00:27:25.711 --> 00:27:29.915 region:rollup2
AGENDA WE DO KNOW THAT THE COST

00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:31.383 region:rollup2
FOR THE CW S. CARES PROJECT IN

00:27:29.915 --> 00:27:32.518 region:rollup2
THE COMPLETION DATE. HAVE NOT

00:27:31.383 --> 00:27:33.085 region:rollup2
BEEN UPDATED SINCE IT'S WHICH

00:27:32.518 --> 00:27:35.621 region:rollup2
pMONOLITHIC APPROACH TO THE

00:27:33.085 --> 00:27:37.222 region:rollup2
AGILE

00:27:35.621 --> 00:27:39.024 region:rollup2
THAT WAS REASONABLE WITH A NEW

00:27:37.222 --> 00:27:40.125 region:rollup2
WAY OF COMPLETING PROJECTS IN

00:27:39.024 --> 00:27:41.627 region:rollup2
THE STATE NEEDED TO ADJUST TO

00:27:40.125 --> 00:27:43.028 region:rollup2
THAT BUT NOW IT'S BEEN A COUPLE

00:27:41.627 --> 00:27:44.263 region:rollup2
OF YEARS SINCE THAT TRANSITION.

00:27:43.028 --> 00:27:45.697 region:rollup2
IN MAY MAKE SENSE TO ASK FOR

00:27:44.263 --> 00:27:49.434 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON WHAT THE

00:27:45.697 --> 00:27:50.035 region:rollup2
TRUE COST MIGHT BE. FROM THE

00:27:49.434 --> 00:27:50.402 region:rollup2
ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU THANK

00:27:50.035 --> 00:27:51.069 region:rollup2
YOU.

00:27:50.402 --> 00:27:52.804 region:rollup2
NOW THAT WE HAVE A QUORUM IF I

00:27:51.069 --> 00:27:55.274 region:rollup2
MAY JUST TAKE A SECOND I'D LIKE

00:27:52.804 --> 00:27:57.643 region:rollup2
TO ESTABLISH IT.

00:27:55.274 --> 00:27:58.510 region:rollup2
DOCTOR ARAMBULA HERE HARPER

00:27:57.643 --> 00:28:00.045 region:rollup2
MATHIS RUBIO.

00:27:58.510 --> 00:28:03.582 region:rollup2
WOULD.

00:28:00.045 --> 00:28:05.884 region:rollup2
QUORUM.

00:28:03.582 --> 00:28:06.585 region:rollup2
IF I MAY VOMIT JUST TO ADD TO

00:28:05.884 --> 00:28:08.420 region:rollup2
THAT POINT WE ARE CURRENTLY

00:28:06.585 --> 00:28:09.988 region:rollup2
WORKING WITH AT THE DEPARTMENT

00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.423 region:rollup2
OF TECHNOLOGY AND THE DEPARTMENT

00:28:09.988 --> 00:28:13.091 region:rollup2
OF FINANCE TO WORK ON A SPECIAL

00:28:11.423 --> 00:28:15.494 region:rollup2
PROJECT REPORT UPDATE.

00:28:13.091 --> 00:28:17.129 region:rollup2
THAT IS GOING TO INCLUDE A LOT

00:28:15.494 --> 00:28:18.497 region:rollup2
OF THE DETAILS SURROUNDING.

00:28:17.129 --> 00:28:20.098 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE

00:28:18.497 --> 00:28:21.633 region:rollup2
ADDITIONAL PLANNING THAT NEEDS

00:28:20.098 --> 00:28:23.635 region:rollup2
TO TAKE PLACE IN TERMS OF

00:28:21.633 --> 00:28:25.437 region:rollup2
DEFINING.

00:28:23.635 --> 00:28:25.938 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE BUILDING?

00:28:25.437 --> 00:28:28.674 region:rollup2
SO TAKING THE ITERATIVE

00:28:25.938 --> 00:28:29.708 region:rollup2
APPROACH.

00:28:28.674 --> 00:28:31.710 region:rollup2
WE DON'T WANT TO DO AS MUCH

00:28:29.708 --> 00:28:33.278 region:rollup2
PLANNING AND DIFF DEFINITION OF

00:28:31.710 --> 00:28:34.446 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS AS THERE IS WHEN

00:28:33.278 --> 00:28:35.013 region:rollup2
YOU'RE TRYING TO BUILD

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:36.148 region:rollup2
EVERYTHING IN ONE SINGLE BIG

00:28:35.013 --> 00:28:37.783 region:rollup2
BANG.

00:28:36.148 --> 00:28:39.084 region:rollup2
BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS WE

00:28:37.783 --> 00:28:40.953 region:rollup2
HAVE TO BE ABLE TO DESCRIBE WHEN

00:28:39.084 --> 00:28:42.955 region:rollup2
WE'RE GOING TO BE DONE.

00:28:40.953 --> 00:28:44.489 region:rollup2
AND WHEN ARE WE GOING TO HAVE A

00:28:42.955 --> 00:28:45.657 region:rollup2
MINIMUM VIABLE PRODUCT IN ORDER

00:28:44.489 --> 00:28:47.626 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO SATISFY THE NEEDS

00:28:45.657 --> 00:28:49.227 region:rollup2
OF THE WORKERS.

00:28:47.626 --> 00:28:51.263 region:rollup2
SO WE'RE PUTTING SOME ADDITIONAL

00:28:49.227 --> 00:28:54.166 region:rollup2
EFFORT INTO PLANNING OF WHAT

00:28:51.263 --> 00:28:56.268 region:rollup2
THAT LOOKS LIKE SO THAT WE CAN.

00:28:54.166 --> 00:28:58.203 region:rollup2
HAVE YOU KNOW TRANSPARENCY IN

00:28:56.268 --> 00:28:59.738 region:rollup2
ACUTE AND I CONVERSATION ABOUT

00:28:58.203 --> 00:29:01.940 region:rollup2
WHAT PEOPLE CAN EXPECT.

00:28:59.738 --> 00:29:03.675 region:rollup2
AND WHEN SO WE'RE HAVE JUST

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:05.077 region:rollup2
STARTED THAT PROCESS FOR THE S.

00:29:03.675 --> 00:29:07.813 region:rollup2
P. ARE WE PLAN ON HAVING IT.

00:29:05.077 --> 00:29:09.081 region:rollup2
SOMETIME THIS SUMMER MIDSUMMER.

00:29:07.813 --> 00:29:11.383 region:rollup2
IS THAT WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE

00:29:09.081 --> 00:29:13.085 region:rollup2
SCHEDULED SO THAT'S GOING TO BE

00:29:11.383 --> 00:29:14.353 region:rollup2
IN A VERY REVEALING IN TERMS OF

00:29:13.085 --> 00:29:15.954 region:rollup2
WHAT IT IS THAT WE'RE GOING TO

00:29:14.353 --> 00:29:17.990 region:rollup2
BE DOING GOING FORWARD. INTO THE

00:29:15.954 --> 00:29:18.857 region:rollup2
INTO THE BUDGET YEAR.

00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.960 region:rollup2
WILL NOT TAKE PUBLIC COMMENT ON

00:29:18.857 --> 00:29:23.595 region:rollup2
THE ISSUE ONE.

00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.197 region:rollup2
SEEING NONE ALL BRING UP TO THE

00:29:23.595 --> 00:29:26.965 region:rollup2
DYESS FOR ANY COMMENTS WE HAVE.

00:29:25.197 --> 00:29:29.034 region:rollup2
A FOLLOW UP ON THAT POINT IF I

00:29:26.965 --> 00:29:30.002 region:rollup2
CAN. IN LIGHT OF WANTING

00:29:29.034 --> 00:29:31.937 region:rollup2
TRANSPARENCY IN THAT

00:29:30.002 --> 00:29:33.805 region:rollup2
CONVERSATION IS THERE A POINT

00:29:31.937 --> 00:29:35.707 region:rollup2
WHERE WE CAN TALK ABOUT COST.

00:29:33.805 --> 00:29:37.009 region:rollup2
I'M HEARING TIMELINES BUT COST

00:29:35.707 --> 00:29:38.710 region:rollup2
IS AS IMPORTANT TO THIS

00:29:37.009 --> 00:29:40.379 region:rollup2
COMMITTEE AND I'M WONDERING IF

00:29:38.710 --> 00:29:41.680 region:rollup2
THERE'S AN UPDATE ON THE AGILE

00:29:40.379 --> 00:29:43.248 region:rollup2
APPROACH AND.

00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:44.816 region:rollup2
IF WE CAN EXPECT SOME COST

00:29:43.248 --> 00:29:47.352 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES

00:29:44.816 --> 00:29:48.954 region:rollup2
AND WHEN THOSE WOULD BECOMING.

00:29:47.352 --> 00:29:50.289 region:rollup2
SO WE WILL CERTAINLY HAVE A COST

00:29:48.954 --> 00:29:51.857 region:rollup2
UPDATE FOR IS PART OF THE MAY

00:29:50.289 --> 00:29:53.692 region:rollup2
REVISION WITH RESPECT TO BUDGET

00:29:51.857 --> 00:29:54.960 region:rollup2
YEAR. AND THEN THE DISCUSSIONS

00:29:53.692 --> 00:29:56.862 region:rollup2
THAT WERE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN

00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:59.131 region:rollup2
WITH THE SPR ARE GOING INTO IT

00:29:56.862 --> 00:30:00.699 region:rollup2
LEND MORE TO. WHAT DOES THE

00:29:59.131 --> 00:30:02.167 region:rollup2
OVERALL PROJECT LOOK LIKE

00:30:00.699 --> 00:30:04.036 region:rollup2
AGAIN A LOT OF IT IS DEPENDENT

00:30:02.167 --> 00:30:05.737 region:rollup2
OF STILL ON PLANNING THAT NEEDS

00:30:04.036 --> 00:30:06.338 region:rollup2
TO OCCUR IN TERMS OF BUILDING

00:30:05.737 --> 00:30:08.974 region:rollup2
WHAT WE'RE CALLING IT PROJECT

00:30:06.338 --> 00:30:11.243 region:rollup2
BLUEPRINT? WHICH IS MORE OF WHAT

00:30:08.974 --> 00:30:13.178 region:rollup2
DO WE EXPECT TO BUILD AND WENT.

00:30:11.243 --> 00:30:29.628 region:rollup2
WITH THAT WE WILL HOLD ISSUE ONE

00:30:13.178 --> 00:30:29.628 region:rollup2
OPEN AND MOVE ON TO ISSUE TO

00:30:36.702 --> 00:30:37.369 region:rollup2
.

00:30:36.835 --> 00:30:39.571 region:rollup2
PERFECT THANK YOU WHAT THE

00:30:37.369 --> 00:30:40.939 region:rollup2
SEPARATELY ISSUE TOO I GET ALL

00:30:39.571 --> 00:30:42.374 region:rollup2
HAVE CHRISTINE DUDLEY TICKETS

00:30:40.939 --> 00:30:44.076 region:rollup2
THROUGH THE OVERVIEW.

00:30:42.374 --> 00:30:44.643 region:rollup2
WHAT'S GOING ON WITHIN THE

00:30:44.076 --> 00:30:44.876 region:rollup2
STATEWIDE AUTOMATED WELFARE

00:30:44.643 --> 00:30:46.378 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:30:44.876 --> 00:30:47.679 region:rollup2
IT.

00:30:46.378 --> 00:30:48.880 region:rollup2
SO THERE ARE THREE CURRENTLY

00:30:47.679 --> 00:30:50.782 region:rollup2
SYSTEMS THAT.

00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:52.384 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THE AUTOMATION FOR

00:30:50.782 --> 00:30:53.652 region:rollup2
ELIGIBILITY DETERMINATION IN

00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:56.021 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA THERE'S LRC POURING

00:30:53.652 --> 00:30:57.522 region:rollup2
CAO WIN. FOR SEVERAL YEARS NOW

00:30:56.021 --> 00:30:59.558 region:rollup2
WE'VE BEEN PLANNING TO.

00:30:57.522 --> 00:31:00.926 region:rollup2
MIGRATE ELLER AND SEE FOR INTO

00:30:59.558 --> 00:31:02.260 region:rollup2
A SINGLE SYSTEM.

00:31:00.926 --> 00:31:04.463 region:rollup2
HOWEVER OUR FEDERAL PARTNERS DID

00:31:02.260 --> 00:31:06.798 region:rollup2
NOT APPROVE OUR FUNDING REQUEST

00:31:04.463 --> 00:31:08.367 region:rollup2
FOR THAT MIGRATION. AND SO OUR

00:31:06.798 --> 00:31:09.868 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES DID NOT BEGIN IN

00:31:08.367 --> 00:31:12.104 region:rollup2
JANUARY OF TWENTY EIGHTEEN AS WE

00:31:09.868 --> 00:31:13.438 region:rollup2
HAD ANTICIPATED. SO A CHANGE IN

00:31:12.104 --> 00:31:15.841 region:rollup2
DIRECTION JUST OCCURRED IN

00:31:13.438 --> 00:31:16.641 region:rollup2
DECEMBER AND WE HAVE NOT UPDATED

00:31:15.841 --> 00:31:18.043 region:rollup2
THE BUDGET YET THOSE CHANGES

00:31:16.641 --> 00:31:19.578 region:rollup2
WILL BE. COMPLETED IN THE MAY

00:31:18.043 --> 00:31:21.546 region:rollup2
REVISION PROCESS.

00:31:19.578 --> 00:31:23.115 region:rollup2
SO IT SEEMS THAT EPONA SUPPORT

00:31:21.546 --> 00:31:23.682 region:rollup2
ARE PHASED IMPLEMENTATION

00:31:23.115 --> 00:31:25.317 region:rollup2
APPROACH IN DOING THIS OVER

00:31:23.682 --> 00:31:25.784 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:31:25.317 --> 00:31:27.052 region:rollup2
BUT.

00:31:25.784 --> 00:31:28.153 region:rollup2
THEY WANTED MORE COMPREHENSIVE

00:31:27.052 --> 00:31:29.588 region:rollup2
PLANNING

00:31:28.153 --> 00:31:31.256 region:rollup2
AND SO ON THAT BASIS THEY HAVE

00:31:29.588 --> 00:31:31.790 region:rollup2
REQUIRED THE STATE COUNTIES TO

00:31:31.256 --> 00:31:34.192 region:rollup2
ENTER AN EXTENDED PLANNING

00:31:31.790 --> 00:31:36.661 region:rollup2
PHASE.

00:31:34.192 --> 00:31:38.096 region:rollup2
USING THIRD PARTY INDEPENDENT

00:31:36.661 --> 00:31:39.197 region:rollup2
CONSULTANTS TO HELP US.

00:31:38.096 --> 00:31:40.499 region:rollup2
DETERMINE THE APPROACH THE

00:31:39.197 --> 00:31:41.833 region:rollup2
REQUIREMENTS IN THE COST

00:31:40.499 --> 00:31:42.634 region:rollup2
ESTIMATES FOR ALL THE ACTIVITIES

00:31:41.833 --> 00:31:45.203 region:rollup2
NECESSARY TO IMPLEMENT A SINGLE

00:31:42.634 --> 00:31:46.405 region:rollup2
SYSTEM.

00:31:45.203 --> 00:31:47.973 region:rollup2
TO THAT END IN JANUARY THEY

00:31:46.405 --> 00:31:50.809 region:rollup2
APPROVED A REQUEST FOR FUNDING

00:31:47.973 --> 00:31:52.944 region:rollup2
FOR PLANNING. BUT AS WE BEGAN TO

00:31:50.809 --> 00:31:54.246 region:rollup2
DO THOSE PLANNING ACTIVITIES

00:31:52.944 --> 00:31:55.714 region:rollup2
THEY STILL BELIEVE WE WORK QUITE

00:31:54.246 --> 00:31:57.282 region:rollup2
REACHING.

00:31:55.714 --> 00:31:59.050 region:rollup2
THEIR GOAL OF COMPREHENSIVE

00:31:57.282 --> 00:32:00.986 region:rollup2
PLANNING FOR THE WHOLE SYSTEM SO

00:31:59.050 --> 00:32:02.287 region:rollup2
THEY ASKED US TO ACCELERATE SOME

00:32:00.986 --> 00:32:03.655 region:rollup2
OF OUR ACTIVITIES FOR THE COW

00:32:02.287 --> 00:32:05.490 region:rollup2
ONE ASSESSMENT AND TO EXTEND

00:32:03.655 --> 00:32:06.291 region:rollup2
THAT PLANNING PHASE.

00:32:05.490 --> 00:32:07.926 region:rollup2
WE HAVE.

00:32:06.291 --> 00:32:09.161 region:rollup2
DONE THAT AND ON MARCH

00:32:07.926 --> 00:32:11.229 region:rollup2
THIRTIETH WE SUBMITTED A NEW

00:32:09.161 --> 00:32:13.231 region:rollup2
REQUEST FOR FEDERAL FUNDING FOR

00:32:11.229 --> 00:32:14.566 region:rollup2
THE PLANNING EFFORT. WE EXPECT

00:32:13.231 --> 00:32:16.101 region:rollup2
THEM TO COMPLETE THEIR REVIEW OF

00:32:14.566 --> 00:32:17.669 region:rollup2
THAT THIS WEEK WE HAVE WORKED

00:32:16.101 --> 00:32:18.703 region:rollup2
VERY CLOSELY WITH THEM THEY KNEW

00:32:17.669 --> 00:32:20.138 region:rollup2
WHAT WE WERE GOING TO SUBMIT

00:32:18.703 --> 00:32:22.107 region:rollup2
BEFORE WE DID.

00:32:20.138 --> 00:32:23.508 region:rollup2
AND ACTUALLY WE'VE BEGUN AS MUCH

00:32:22.107 --> 00:32:25.710 region:rollup2
OF THAT WORK AS WE CAN BECAUSE

00:32:23.508 --> 00:32:27.846 region:rollup2
THE TIME LINES ARE SO SHORT.

00:32:25.710 --> 00:32:29.214 region:rollup2
THE TIMELINE THAT WAS IN YOUR

00:32:27.846 --> 00:32:30.882 region:rollup2
SUBCOMMITTEE AGENDA WAS

00:32:29.214 --> 00:32:32.417 region:rollup2
DEVELOPED OVER A YEAR AGO WITH

00:32:30.882 --> 00:32:34.152 region:rollup2
THIS EXTENDED PLANNING THERE ARE

00:32:32.417 --> 00:32:36.021 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF THOSE FACES. THAT WE

00:32:34.152 --> 00:32:38.123 region:rollup2
HAVE SHADED TO SHOW YOU WHAT WE

00:32:36.021 --> 00:32:40.225 region:rollup2
ARE CURRENTLY ANALYZING THE LRC

00:32:38.123 --> 00:32:42.928 region:rollup2
FOR MIGRATION THE LONG TERM AND

00:32:40.225 --> 00:32:43.495 region:rollup2
A NO CONSOLIDATED PORTAL ALL OF

00:32:42.928 --> 00:32:43.895 region:rollup2
THOSE THINGS ARE WITHIN THIS

00:32:43.495 --> 00:32:48.266 region:rollup2
PLAN.

00:32:43.895 --> 00:32:50.435 region:rollup2
PHASE.

00:32:48.266 --> 00:32:51.903 region:rollup2
SO THE MAJORITY OF THE PLANNING

00:32:50.435 --> 00:32:53.305 region:rollup2
AND ANALYSIS ACTIVITIES WILL BE

00:32:51.903 --> 00:32:54.439 region:rollup2

FOOD POLICY COMMUNITY SOME OR

00:34:10.348 --> 00:34:13.184 region:rollup2
ALL OF THIS FOR REQUESTING A

00:34:11.883 --> 00:34:14.252 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE TO

00:34:13.184 --> 00:34:15.620 region:rollup2
ESTABLISH A STAKEHOLDER WORKING

00:34:14.252 --> 00:34:17.289 region:rollup2
GROUP. TO ADVISE THE

ADMINISTRATION AND COUNTIES ON

00:34:17.289 --> 00:34:19.824 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEM MIGRATION AS IT GOES

00:34:19.224 --> 00:34:21.559 region:rollup2
FOR.

00:34:19.824 --> 00:34:22.427 region:rollup2
WE THINK THIS IS AN EXTREMELY

00:34:21.559 --> 00:34:24.162 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:34:22.427 --> 00:34:26.498 region:rollup2
ENDEAVOR THAT THE STATE IS

00:34:24.162 --> 00:34:27.232 region:rollup2
INVOLVED IN RIGHT NOW ONE THAT'S

00:34:26.498 --> 00:34:29.501 region:rollup2
GOING TO HAVE SIGNIFICANT.

00:34:27.232 --> 00:34:30.635 region:rollup2
POTENTIALLY EXTREMELY POSITIVE

00:34:29.501 --> 00:34:32.404 region:rollup2
IMPACTS FOR CLIENTS.

00:34:30.635 --> 00:34:34.272 region:rollup2
AND THAT IS I THINK IT THE

00:34:32.404 --> 00:34:36.441 region:rollup2
CENTER OF WHY WE'RE REQUESTING

00:34:34.272 --> 00:34:38.076 region:rollup2
THE TBL IS BECAUSE WE DO THINK

00:34:36.441 --> 00:34:39.577 region:rollup2
THAT HAVING THE VOICES OF

00:34:38.076 --> 00:34:41.313 region:rollup2
CLIENTS AND PEOPLE WHO HAVE

00:34:39.577 --> 00:34:43.515 region:rollup2
SIGNIFICANT EXPERIENCE. AND HOW

00:34:41.313 --> 00:34:44.916 region:rollup2
THE SYSTEMS WORK ON THE GROUND

00:34:43.515 --> 00:34:46.451 region:rollup2
AND HOW THEY WERE AND HOW OUR

00:34:44.916 --> 00:34:47.052 region:rollup2
CLIENTS INTERFACE INTERACT WITH

00:34:46.451 --> 00:34:49.921 region:rollup2
THEM.

00:34:47.052 --> 00:34:52.324 region:rollup2
IS IS GOING TO MAKE THAT.

00:34:49.921 --> 00:34:54.092 region:rollup2
THAT MIGRATION THAT MUCH MORE

00:34:52.324 --> 00:34:56.027 region:rollup2
EFFECTIVE WHEN IT COMES OUT.

00:34:54.092 --> 00:34:57.162 region:rollup2
THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ARE

00:34:56.027 --> 00:34:58.496 region:rollup2
ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN INVOLVED

00:34:57.162 --> 00:35:00.131 region:rollup2
WITH IN A VARIETY OF PROJECTS

00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:01.766 region:rollup2
OVER MANY YEARS PROBABLY MOST

00:35:00.131 --> 00:35:03.301 region:rollup2
NOTABLY THE WORK AROUND THE

00:35:01.766 --> 00:35:04.669 region:rollup2
AFFORDABLE CARE ACT. AND THAT'S

00:35:03.301 --> 00:35:05.370 region:rollup2
VERY STAKEHOLDER WORK GROUPS

00:35:04.669 --> 00:35:07.038 region:rollup2
THAT WERE ESTABLISHED THERE

00:35:05.370 --> 00:35:08.506 region:rollup2
WHICH I THINK IN RETROSPECT

00:35:07.038 --> 00:35:09.908 region:rollup2
REALLY QUITE BENEFICIAL TO THE

00:35:08.506 --> 00:35:11.409 region:rollup2
PROCESS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE

00:35:09.908 --> 00:35:11.977 region:rollup2
TO KIND OF ROLL OUT THAT WE DID

00:35:11.409 --> 00:35:14.079 region:rollup2
FOR THAT.

00:35:11.977 --> 00:35:15.447 region:rollup2
SO WE'D WE BRING NOT JUST

00:35:14.079 --> 00:35:17.115 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OUR CLIENTS BUT I

00:35:15.447 --> 00:35:18.750 region:rollup2
THINK WE ALSO CAN BRING THE

00:35:17.115 --> 00:35:21.686 region:rollup2
EXPERIENCE OF.

00:35:18.750 --> 00:35:23.555 region:rollup2
WORKING IN IT SYSTEMS TO THIS

00:35:21.686 --> 00:35:24.990 region:rollup2
PROCESS QUITE EFFECTIVELY ARM

00:35:23.555 --> 00:35:26.791 region:rollup2
AND I THINK AT THE BOTTOM WHAT

00:35:24.990 --> 00:35:28.660 region:rollup2
WE'RE REALLY HOPING HERE IS THAT

00:35:26.791 --> 00:35:30.395 region:rollup2
WE CAN MAKE THE SYSTEM WORK

00:35:28.660 --> 00:35:33.698 region:rollup2
BETTER. THAT THERE WILL BE LESS

00:35:30.395 --> 00:35:34.199 region:rollup2
CLIMB AIRS FASTER OPERATIONS.

00:35:33.698 --> 00:35:35.834 region:rollup2
PROVISION OF BENEFITS OR

CLIENTS.

00:35:35.834 --> 00:35:41.139 region:rollup2
AND ENSURING THAT REALLY VOTE

00:35:39.237 --> 00:35:43.074 region:rollup2
THAT THE CLIENTS GET WHAT THIS

00:35:41.139 --> 00:35:44.576 region:rollup2
BODY.

00:35:43.074 --> 00:35:46.244 region:rollup2
HAS CREATED FOR THEM AND THAT

00:35:44.576 --> 00:35:48.213 region:rollup2
THEY GET IT IN A TIMELY FASHION.

00:35:46.244 --> 00:35:49.948 region:rollup2
WITHOUT AIR SO FOR ALL THOSE

00:35:48.213 --> 00:35:50.482 region:rollup2
REASONS WE ARE REQUESTING A

00:35:49.948 --> 00:35:51.983 region:rollup2
TRAILER BILL LANGUAGE THAT

00:35:50.482 --> 00:35:53.451 region:rollup2

GROUND PERSPECTIVE. ON THAT EVEN

00:36:36.795 --> 00:36:39.698 region:rollup2
THOUGH THEY OR WE MIGHT NOT HAVE

00:36:38.063 --> 00:36:41.433 region:rollup2
TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN IN EVERY

00:36:39.698 --> 00:36:42.867 region:rollup2
AREA THAT HAVING THAT

00:36:41.433 --> 00:36:44.602 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE INFORMS THE PROCESS.

00:36:42.867 --> 00:36:46.438 region:rollup2

AND SECONDLY I THINK OUR

00:36:59.317 --> 00:37:02.087 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE ON IS THAT THE

00:55:50.080 --> 00:55:54.618 region:rollup2
CRITERIA SO. WERE BETWEEN A ROCK

00:55:52.649 --> 00:55:56.687 region:rollup2
AND A HARD PLACE BECAUSE WE HAVE

00:55:54.618 --> 00:55:58.355 region:rollup2
TO HIRE PEOPLE THAT HAVE A POST

00:55:56.687 --> 00:56:00.224 region:rollup2
ACADEMY AS A CLASSIFICATION

00:55:58.355 --> 00:56:01.491 region:rollup2
REQUIRES. BUT WE CAN DO NOTHING

00:56:00.224 --> 00:56:03.360 region:rollup2
TO.

00:56:01.491 --> 00:56:04.728 region:rollup2
ADVANCE OR CONTINUE THEIR POST

00:56:03.360 --> 00:56:05.863 region:rollup2
CERTIFICATION THERE'S TRAINING

00:56:04.728 --> 00:56:06.897 region:rollup2
THAT GUY COMES ALONG WITH THAT

00:56:05.863 --> 00:56:08.565 region:rollup2
WE DON'T HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO

00:56:06.897 --> 00:56:11.268 region:rollup2
IT BECAUSE POST IS NOT CERTIFIED

00:56:08.565 --> 00:56:13.003 region:rollup2
US. AS OPPOSED AGENCY.

00:56:11.268 --> 00:56:14.238 region:rollup2
ARE AND THAT'S WHAT THIS IS THIS

00:56:13.003 --> 00:56:15.739 region:rollup2
HAS CREATED A RECRUITMENT

00:56:14.238 --> 00:56:17.241 region:rollup2
RETENTION ISSUE FOR US BECAUSE

00:56:15.739 --> 00:56:18.942 region:rollup2
THAT POST CERTIFICATION IS

00:56:17.241 --> 00:56:20.077 region:rollup2
CRITICAL TO PEACE OFFICERS.

00:56:18.942 --> 00:56:20.611 region:rollup2
BECAUSE IF THEY LOSE IT THEY

00:56:20.077 --> 00:56:22.079 region:rollup2
CAN'T GO WORK FOR ANOTHER

00:56:20.611 --> 00:56:23.614 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

00:56:22.079 --> 00:56:25.148 region:rollup2
SO WE'VE HAD A VERY TOUGH TIME.

00:56:23.614 --> 00:56:27.150 region:rollup2
FILLING THESE POSITIONS.

00:56:25.148 --> 00:56:27.651 region:rollup2
WE HAVE AS ICE IS I MENTIONED

00:56:27.150 --> 00:56:28.819 region:rollup2
WERE RELYING ON RETIRED

00:56:27.651 --> 00:56:29.820 region:rollup2
ANNUITANTS.

00:56:28.819 --> 00:56:31.455 region:rollup2
ONCE WE RECEIVED A LETTER FROM

00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:33.690 region:rollup2
POST.

00:56:31.455 --> 00:56:36.026 region:rollup2
WITH THE DENIAL WE RECOGNIZE WE

00:56:33.690 --> 00:56:37.160 region:rollup2
HAD A PROBLEM YOU KNOW FOR ITS

00:56:36.026 --> 00:56:39.663 region:rollup2
FORESTS AS SUSTAINABILITY.

00:56:37.160 --> 00:56:40.998 region:rollup2
CARTON.

00:56:39.663 --> 00:56:42.399 region:rollup2
SO WHAT WE DID WAS WE LOOKED AT

00:56:40.998 --> 00:56:44.001 region:rollup2
DIFFERENT CLASSIFICATIONS

00:56:42.399 --> 00:56:45.502 region:rollup2
AND AND THE CLASSIFICATION OF

00:56:44.001 --> 00:56:47.037 region:rollup2
SPECIAL AGENT REALLY SUITED THE

00:56:45.502 --> 00:56:48.939 region:rollup2
TYPES OF TYPE OF WORK THAT WE DO

00:56:47.037 --> 00:56:50.607 region:rollup2
WE ARE YOU DEAK IN THAT WE ONLY

00:56:48.939 --> 00:56:52.109 region:rollup2
CONDUCT INVESTIGATIONS.

00:56:50.607 --> 00:56:53.677 region:rollup2
UP PEACE OFFICERS FOR SERIOUS

00:56:52.109 --> 00:56:54.711 region:rollup2
MISCONDUCT FOR DEPARTMENTS TO

00:56:53.677 --> 00:56:56.079 region:rollup2
HOSPITALS AND DEVELOPMENT

00:56:54.711 --> 00:56:57.314 region:rollup2
SERVICES.

00:56:56.079 --> 00:56:59.149 region:rollup2
SO THERE'S A UNIQUE SKILL SET

00:56:57.314 --> 00:57:00.317 region:rollup2
THAT COMES WITH THAT.

00:56:59.149 --> 00:57:01.385 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO HAVE WHAT YOU NEED

00:57:00.317 --> 00:57:02.653 region:rollup2
TO HAVE BEEN A SUPERVISOR YOU

00:57:01.385 --> 00:57:04.521 region:rollup2
NEED TO UNDERSTAND EMPLOYER

00:57:02.653 --> 00:57:05.956 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEE RELATIONSHIPS.

00:57:04.521 --> 00:57:07.457 region:rollup2
YOU NEED TO UNDERSTAND THE

00:57:05.956 --> 00:57:08.959 region:rollup2
PEACE OFFICERS BILL WRITES THE

00:57:07.457 --> 00:57:10.827 region:rollup2
INVESTIGATOR CLASSIFICATION THAT

00:57:08.959 --> 00:57:11.995 region:rollup2
WE CURRENTLY HAVE.

00:57:10.827 --> 00:57:13.196 region:rollup2
IS MORE OF A GENERAL

00:57:11.995 --> 00:57:15.032 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATION THAT USE ACROSS

00:57:13.196 --> 00:57:16.800 region:rollup2
STATE SERVICES IT'S NOT SPECIFIC

00:57:15.032 --> 00:57:18.302 region:rollup2
TO WHAT WE DO IT'S NOT THAT THEY

00:57:16.800 --> 00:57:20.237 region:rollup2
CAN'T DO THAT INVESTIGATION BUT

00:57:18.302 --> 00:57:21.138 region:rollup2
WHAT WE FOUND EVEN. IN THE

00:57:20.237 --> 00:57:22.172 region:rollup2
POSITIONS WE FILLED IT'S ABOUT A

00:57:21.138 --> 00:57:23.674 region:rollup2
TWO YEAR PROCESS TO COME UP TO

00:57:22.172 --> 00:57:25.342 region:rollup2
SPEED.

00:57:23.674 --> 00:57:27.844 region:rollup2
THE PROBLEM IS IN THE MEANTIME

00:57:25.342 --> 00:57:29.780 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO WE HAVE A CASELOAD.

00:57:27.844 --> 00:57:30.447 region:rollup2
IF THESE INVESTIGATIONS SO THAT

00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.049 region:rollup2
WE'RE DOING I THINK WE'VE DONE A

00:57:30.447 --> 00:57:33.517 region:rollup2
HUNDRED PEOPLE ALWAYS HAS BEEN

00:57:32.049 --> 00:57:34.484 region:rollup2
EXISTENCE FOR TWO YEARS.

00:57:33.517 --> 00:57:35.786 region:rollup2
WE'VE DONE IN THE FIRST TWO

00:57:34.484 --> 00:57:36.386 region:rollup2
YEARS MORE THAN A HUNDRED TWENTY

00:57:35.786 --> 00:57:37.688 region:rollup2
SIX INVESTIGATIONS DURING THAT

00:57:36.386 --> 00:57:39.389 region:rollup2
TIME.

00:57:37.688 --> 00:57:41.591 region:rollup2
SO IT'S IT'S A SIGNIFICANT CASE

00:57:39.389 --> 00:57:43.160 region:rollup2
LOAD IN. AND WHAT WE'RE FINDING

00:57:41.591 --> 00:57:44.628 region:rollup2
IS THAT THE SPECIAL AGENT IS A

00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:45.762 region:rollup2
BETTER CLASSIFICATION FOR THE

00:57:44.628 --> 00:57:47.965 region:rollup2
TYPE OF WORK THAT WE DO.

00:57:45.762 --> 00:57:48.198 region:rollup2
AND THEN.

00:57:47.965 --> 00:57:50.634 region:rollup2
LASTLY.

00:57:48.198 --> 00:57:51.234 region:rollup2
.

00:57:50.634 --> 00:57:52.336 region:rollup2
WE HAVE ANY ISSUE THAT THERE'S

00:57:51.234 --> 00:57:53.003 region:rollup2
A.

00:57:52.336 --> 00:57:55.439 region:rollup2
THERE'S A CONFLICT THAT'S

00:57:53.003 --> 00:57:57.674 region:rollup2
CREATED WE HAVE AN INVESTIGATOR

00:57:55.439 --> 00:57:59.209 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION. OF

00:57:57.674 --> 00:58:00.143 region:rollup2
ANOTHER INVESTIGATOR OR HOSPITAL

00:57:59.209 --> 00:58:00.777 region:rollup2
POLICE OFFICER THAT'S

00:58:00.143 --> 00:58:02.546 region:rollup2
REPRESENTED BY THE SAME

00:58:00.777 --> 00:58:04.481 region:rollup2
BARGAINING UNIT.

00:58:02.546 --> 00:58:06.316 region:rollup2
SO IT CREATES A CONFLICT IT'S

00:58:04.481 --> 00:58:08.018 region:rollup2
NOT THAT IT CAN'T HAPPEN OR IT

00:58:06.316 --> 00:58:09.353 region:rollup2
DOESN'T HAPPEN STATE SERVICE.

00:58:08.018 --> 00:58:11.221 region:rollup2
THE FACT REMAINS THAT IT'S NOT A

00:58:09.353 --> 00:58:12.923 region:rollup2
BEST PRACTICE.

00:58:11.221 --> 00:58:14.124 region:rollup2
IF YOU LOOK AT THE CHP OR YOU

00:58:12.923 --> 00:58:15.192 region:rollup2
LOOK IT DEPARTMENT ATTRACTIONS

00:58:14.124 --> 00:58:16.793 region:rollup2
THEY ALWAYS HAVE EXCLUDED

00:58:15.192 --> 00:58:18.328 region:rollup2
EMPLOYEES.

00:58:16.793 --> 00:58:20.564 region:rollup2
CONDUCTING INVESTIGATIONS TO

00:58:18.328 --> 00:58:21.465 region:rollup2
HELP AVOID THAT CONFLICT AND WE

00:58:20.564 --> 00:58:23.400 region:rollup2
HAVE DOCUMENTED INCIDENTS WHERE

00:58:21.465 --> 00:58:23.800 region:rollup2
WE'VE HAD CONFLICTS.

00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:25.969 region:rollup2
I DON'T SEE US.

00:58:23.800 --> 00:58:26.570 region:rollup2
ELLIOT'S BEEN OPPOSED TO THIS

00:58:25.969 --> 00:58:28.071 region:rollup2
AND THAT AND THEY HAVE STATED

00:58:26.570 --> 00:58:28.638 region:rollup2
HAY ACROSS.

00:58:28.071 --> 00:58:29.539 region:rollup2
YOU KNOW IT HAPPENS ACROSS.

00:58:28.638 --> 00:58:31.608 region:rollup2
.

00:58:29.539 --> 00:58:33.243 region:rollup2
STATE DEPARTMENTS.

00:58:31.608 --> 00:58:34.678 region:rollup2
IN TERMS OF OUR.

00:58:33.243 --> 00:58:36.146 region:rollup2
THIS CONFLICT BUT IT DOESN'T

00:58:34.678 --> 00:58:36.847 region:rollup2
MAKE IT RIGHT.

00:58:36.146 --> 00:58:38.348 region:rollup2
IT DOESN'T MAKE IT A BEST

00:58:36.847 --> 00:58:39.583 region:rollup2
PRACTICE AND THAT'S THAT'S

00:58:38.348 --> 00:58:41.718 region:rollup2
REALLY WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT WERE

00:58:39.583 --> 00:58:42.219 region:rollup2
FOCUSED ON BEST PRACTICES. FOR

00:58:41.718 --> 00:58:43.420 region:rollup2
THE POLICE DEPARTMENT SO

00:58:42.219 --> 00:58:45.022 region:rollup2
CERTAINLY.

00:58:43.420 --> 00:58:46.690 region:rollup2
WE HAVE TO HOLD DEPARTMENTS TO A

00:58:45.022 --> 00:58:47.758 region:rollup2
HIGHER STANDARD WE HAVE TO BE AT

00:58:46.690 --> 00:58:49.393 region:rollup2
A HIGHER STANDARD THAT'S WHAT

00:58:47.758 --> 00:58:51.161 region:rollup2
WE'RE SEEKING. THE RE

00:58:49.393 --> 00:58:52.629 region:rollup2
CLASSIFICATION OF THIS POSITION.

00:58:51.161 --> 00:58:54.030 region:rollup2
REALLY IT COMES DOWN TO

00:58:52.629 --> 00:58:54.664 region:rollup2
SUSTAINABILITY I THINK WE'VE

00:58:54.030 --> 00:58:56.466 region:rollup2
REALLY HAD A POSITIVE IMPACT ON

00:58:54.664 --> 00:58:57.734 region:rollup2
THE DEPARTMENTS.

00:58:56.466 --> 00:58:59.202 region:rollup2
UP TO THIS POINT TIME WE'RE

00:58:57.734 --> 00:59:00.437 region:rollup2
UNCOVERING THINGS THAT MAY HAVE

00:58:59.202 --> 00:59:02.239 region:rollup2
NOT BEEN UNCOVERED IN THE PAST

00:59:00.437 --> 00:59:02.706 region:rollup2
FOR MAKING RECOMMENDATIONS THE

00:59:02.239 --> 00:59:04.107 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENTS ARE MAKING

00:59:02.706 --> 00:59:05.409 region:rollup2
IMPROVEMENTS SO. OUR ROLE IS

00:59:04.107 --> 00:59:07.411 region:rollup2
IMPORTANT.

00:59:05.409 --> 00:59:09.413 region:rollup2
BUT TO CONTINUE TO SURVIVE

00:59:07.411 --> 00:59:10.781 region:rollup2
UTILIZING RETIRED ANNUITANTS IS

00:59:09.413 --> 00:59:12.516 region:rollup2
NOT A LONG TERM FIX FOR OUR

00:59:10.781 --> 00:59:14.818 region:rollup2
PROBLEMS.

00:59:12.516 --> 00:59:16.186 region:rollup2
SO WE JUST REQUEST YOUR SUPPORT

00:59:14.818 --> 00:59:18.155 region:rollup2

APART FROM EACH OTHER.

00:59:58.195 --> 01:00:00.063 region:rollup2

IS TO DETERMINE. IF ANY OF THE

01:08:47.490 --> 01:08:50.026 region:rollup2
HELP FOR MANY PROGRAMMERS ARE

01:08:48.992 --> 01:08:51.995 region:rollup2
AGENCY.

01:08:50.026 --> 01:08:53.429 region:rollup2
TOO OFTEN THAT WE CONCLUDE THAT

01:08:51.995 --> 01:08:54.497 region:rollup2
OUR FOLKS DID NOT ACCESS ANY OF

01:08:53.429 --> 01:08:55.131 region:rollup2
THE SERVICES.

01:08:54.497 --> 01:08:56.532 region:rollup2
OR THAT THEY WOULD HAVE

01:08:55.131 --> 01:08:57.967 region:rollup2
QUALIFIED FOR SUCH AS THE

01:08:56.532 --> 01:09:00.303 region:rollup2
INDEPENDENT LIVING PROGRAM

01:08:57.967 --> 01:09:01.104 region:rollup2
EXTENDED FAR SECURE TV GRANT.

01:09:00.303 --> 01:09:02.605 region:rollup2
ARE AND THERE'S A LIST OF

01:09:01.104 --> 01:09:04.307 region:rollup2
REASONS WHY FOSTER YOUTH DO NOT

01:09:02.605 --> 01:09:05.408 region:rollup2
TAXES THESE CRUCIAL SUPPORT.

01:09:04.307 --> 01:09:06.676 region:rollup2
BUT WE KNOW THAT THIRTY PERCENT

01:09:05.408 --> 01:09:07.877 region:rollup2
OF HOUSE YOU'D BECOME HOMELESS

01:09:06.676 --> 01:09:09.645 region:rollup2
WITH IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF

01:09:07.877 --> 01:09:10.980 region:rollup2
LIVING CARE.

01:09:09.645 --> 01:09:11.581 region:rollup2
WE KNOW THAT THIRTY PERCENT OF

01:09:10.980 --> 01:09:12.615 region:rollup2
YOUNG PEOPLE WHO HAD TO FOSTER

01:09:11.581 --> 01:09:14.150 region:rollup2
CARE.

01:09:12.615 --> 01:09:15.018 region:rollup2
YOUNG WOMEN WHO EXIT FOSTER

01:09:14.150 --> 01:09:16.486 region:rollup2
CARE BECOME PREGNANT WITHIN THE

01:09:15.018 --> 01:09:18.354 region:rollup2
FIRST SIX MONTHS.

01:09:16.486 --> 01:09:19.622 region:rollup2
A LIVING CARE.

01:09:18.354 --> 01:09:21.124 region:rollup2
AND IT IS ALSO TRUE THAT YOU GO

01:09:19.622 --> 01:09:23.259 region:rollup2
INTO SURVIVAL MODE WHEN THEY

01:09:21.124 --> 01:09:25.261 region:rollup2
LEAVE OUR CARE BECAUSE THEY ARE

01:09:23.259 --> 01:09:26.729 region:rollup2
LEFT TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES.

01:09:25.261 --> 01:09:27.897 region:rollup2
THIS MEANS THAT INCOME IS A

01:09:26.729 --> 01:09:29.666 region:rollup2
HIGHER PRIORITY THAN WORKING

01:09:27.897 --> 01:09:30.767 region:rollup2
TOWARDS A LONG TERM GOAL.

01:09:29.666 --> 01:09:32.468 region:rollup2
IT MEANS THAT PUTTING FOOD ON

01:09:30.767 --> 01:09:33.336 region:rollup2
THE TABLE FOR THEIR CHILD.

01:09:32.468 --> 01:09:34.671 region:rollup2
IS A BIGGER PRIORITY THEM

01:09:33.336 --> 01:09:36.439 region:rollup2
PASSING THE TEST.

01:09:34.671 --> 01:09:38.107 region:rollup2
AND THIS OFTEN LEADS

01:09:36.439 --> 01:09:40.843 region:rollup2
TO HAVING TO DROP OUT OF SCHOOL

01:09:38.107 --> 01:09:41.577 region:rollup2
TO WORK AND PROVIDE.

01:09:40.843 --> 01:09:43.546 region:rollup2
OTHERS NEVER HAD THE CHANCE TO

01:09:41.577 --> 01:09:44.814 region:rollup2
START FROM THE VERY BEGINNING.

01:09:43.546 --> 01:09:46.449 region:rollup2
MANY EXPRESS THEIR VERY SIMPLY

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:48.251 region:rollup2
THEY ARE TIRED OF BEING GOVERNED

01:09:46.449 --> 01:09:49.152 region:rollup2
BY AN INSTITUTION.

01:09:48.251 --> 01:09:50.453 region:rollup2
SO WHEN THEY TURN EIGHTEEN

01:09:49.152 --> 01:09:52.288 region:rollup2
EMANCIPATE THE CLOSE THE DOOR

01:09:50.453 --> 01:09:53.589 region:rollup2
BEHIND THEMSELVES FORBIDDING

01:09:52.288 --> 01:09:54.657 region:rollup2
THEM VALUABLE SUPPORT PROGRAMS

01:09:53.589 --> 01:09:56.259 region:rollup2
AND RESOURCES THAT THEY WOULD

01:09:54.657 --> 01:09:58.027 region:rollup2
QUALIFY FOR.

01:09:56.259 --> 01:09:59.028 region:rollup2
WITH EVERYTHING THAT WE KNOW.

01:09:58.027 --> 01:10:00.630 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE

01:09:59.028 --> 01:10:01.898 region:rollup2
BRAIN SCIENCE RESEARCH WE KNOW

01:10:00.630 --> 01:10:02.999 region:rollup2
THAT YOUNG PEOPLE DON'T DEVELOP

01:10:01.898 --> 01:10:04.567 region:rollup2
CRITICAL THINKING AND DECISION

01:10:02.999 --> 01:10:05.702 region:rollup2
MAKING ABILITY.

01:10:04.567 --> 01:10:07.737 region:rollup2
AND TALK UNTIL IT LEAVES THE

01:10:05.702 --> 01:10:08.671 region:rollup2
TWENTY FIFTH BIRTHDAY.

01:10:07.737 --> 01:10:09.972 region:rollup2
THIS IS CRUCIAL IS HIGHER

01:10:08.671 --> 01:10:10.773 region:rollup2
EDUCATION REQUIRES DISCIPLINE

01:10:09.972 --> 01:10:12.708 region:rollup2
THAT MANY FOSTER YOU.

01:10:10.773 --> 01:10:15.845 region:rollup2
FORTUNATELY.

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:16.979 region:rollup2
AND NEVER DEVELOP LOVING CARE.

01:10:15.845 --> 01:10:18.981 region:rollup2
THEY HAVE TO LEARN ABOUT LIFE

01:10:16.979 --> 01:10:20.149 region:rollup2
THE HARD WAY.

01:10:18.981 --> 01:10:21.517 region:rollup2
ARE THESE INVESTMENTS IN TV

01:10:20.149 --> 01:10:22.852 region:rollup2

TO LIVE SELF SUSTAINING LIVES.

IT'S ABOUT GIVING THOSE WHO HAD

01:10:26.556 --> 01:10:29.258 region:rollup2
NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN

WE KNOW THAT THESE INVESTMENTS

01:10:33.029 --> 01:10:35.832 region:rollup2
GOING A LONG WAY IN IMPROVING

01:10:34.130 --> 01:10:37.066 region:rollup2
THE EDUCATIONAL OUTCOMES.

01:10:35.832 --> 01:10:37.934 region:rollup2
AS THESE PROGRAMS ABOUT ARE

01:10:37.066 --> 01:10:39.102 region:rollup2
UNIQUE IN THAT THEY ALLOW

01:10:37.934 --> 01:10:40.570 region:rollup2
STUDENTS TO PAY FOR SCHOOL

01:10:39.102 --> 01:10:42.371 region:rollup2
RELATED EXPENSES. BEYOND TUITION

SCHOOL SUPPLIES

01:10:46.008 --> 01:10:48.244 region:rollup2
IT'S FOR THESE REASONS THAT WERE

01:10:47.076 --> 01:10:49.479 region:rollup2
URGING SUPPORT ON THIS CRUCIAL

01:10:48.244 --> 01:10:52.782 region:rollup2
INVESTMENT.

01:10:49.479 --> 01:10:55.017 region:rollup2
MISTER AGUILAR.

01:10:52.782 --> 01:10:56.853 region:rollup2

WENT TO.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:11:02.625 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE BECAUSE A

01:11:00.423 --> 01:11:04.694 region:rollup2
TEACHER UNDERSTOOD BEANO TOLD ME

01:11:02.625 --> 01:11:06.395 region:rollup2
TO START COLLEGE.

01:11:04.694 --> 01:11:08.131 region:rollup2
HE ASKED ME WHAT WOULD I BE

01:11:08.131 --> 01:11:12.135 region:rollup2

01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.370 region:rollup2
SO THEREFORE I DECIDED TO GO TO

01:11:12.135 --> 01:11:16.139 region:rollup2
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

01:11:14.370 --> 01:11:18.541 region:rollup2
THAT TIME I WAS VERY CRITICAL IN

01:11:16.139 --> 01:11:19.809 region:rollup2
MY ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID.

01:11:18.541 --> 01:11:22.011 region:rollup2
SHOULD I HAVE WAITED TWO OR

01:11:19.809 --> 01:11:23.346 region:rollup2

STARTING EDUCATION AT THE AGE OF

01:11:28.551 --> 01:11:32.822 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN.

SECURITY AND MORE THAN ANYTHING

01:11:37.426 --> 01:11:42.064 region:rollup2
FOR PEACE OF MIND.

01:11:40.062 --> 01:11:44.066 region:rollup2
NOW ONE COULD SAY WHY NOT JUST

01:11:44.066 --> 01:11:48.905 region:rollup2

01:11:51.807 --> 01:11:56.612 region:rollup2

AND WHEN I WAS AT UCLA THE

01:11:58.781 --> 01:12:03.386 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL BURDEN BECAME SO HARD

01:12:01.184 --> 01:12:03.886 region:rollup2
THAT ALL I COULD REALLY DO WAS

01:12:03.386 --> 01:12:06.455 region:rollup2
WORK AT SCHOOL AND GO TO

01:12:03.886 --> 01:12:08.491 region:rollup2

I COULD NOT FULLY EXPERIENCE IN

01:12:08.491 --> 01:12:11.928 region:rollup2
BE I COULD NOT BE A VIABLE PART

01:12:10.526 --> 01:12:13.763 region:rollup2
OF THE COLLEGE EXPERIENCE

01:12:11.928 --> 01:12:15.798 region:rollup2
WHICH MEANT I COULD NOT AFFORD

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:17.066 region:rollup2
TO JOIN A SORORITY. I COULD NOT

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:18.301 region:rollup2
AFFORD TO DO FREE WORK IN AN

01:12:17.066 --> 01:12:19.268 region:rollup2
INTERNSHIP

01:12:18.301 --> 01:12:20.837 region:rollup2
I COULD NOT AFFORD TO STUDY

01:12:19.268 --> 01:12:21.871 region:rollup2
ABROAD.

01:12:20.837 --> 01:12:24.707 region:rollup2
ALL I COULD DO WAS WORK AND GO

01:12:21.871 --> 01:12:26.642 region:rollup2
TO CLASS.

01:12:24.707 --> 01:12:28.211 region:rollup2
THIS WAS EXPRESSED

01:12:26.642 --> 01:12:30.646 region:rollup2
IN AN INTERESTING WAY THAT HAD

01:12:28.211 --> 01:12:32.949 region:rollup2
TO DO WITH THE CHAFEE GRANT.

01:12:30.646 --> 01:12:34.650 region:rollup2
IN MY TWENTY THIRD YEAR OF LIFE

01:12:32.949 --> 01:12:36.552 region:rollup2
IS WHEN I WAS GIVEN THE AMAZING

01:12:34.650 --> 01:12:39.889 region:rollup2
OPPORTUNITY. TO WORK WITH THE

01:12:36.552 --> 01:12:42.258 region:rollup2
NOW ATTORNEY GENERAL IN DC.

01:12:39.889 --> 01:12:44.560 region:rollup2
BUT I WAS TWENTY THREE.

01:12:42.258 --> 01:12:46.395 region:rollup2
AND THAT PROGRAM WOULD NOT ALLOW

01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.464 region:rollup2
ME TO WORK WORK STUDY.

01:12:46.395 --> 01:12:50.733 region:rollup2
SO IN BC I HAD NO EXTRA

01:12:48.464 --> 01:12:52.201 region:rollup2
FINANCIAL AID I WAS UNABLE TO

01:12:50.733 --> 01:12:53.903 region:rollup2
WORK WORK STUDY SO I HAD NO

01:12:52.201 --> 01:12:56.005 region:rollup2
MONEY TO PAY. FOR HOUSING OR

01:12:53.903 --> 01:12:56.839 region:rollup2
FOOD.

01:12:56.005 --> 01:12:58.307 region:rollup2
AND I DIDN'T HAVE THE CHAFEE

01:12:56.839 --> 01:12:59.876 region:rollup2
GRANT WHICH I WAS USED TO

01:12:58.307 --> 01:13:01.077 region:rollup2
GETTING FROM THE AGES FROM

01:12:59.876 --> 01:13:03.145 region:rollup2
EIGHTEEN TO TWENTY TWO. BUT IT

01:13:01.077 --> 01:13:05.014 region:rollup2
WAS CAPPED.

01:13:03.145 --> 01:13:06.549 region:rollup2
AND IN THAT VERY SEMESTER I

01:13:05.014 --> 01:13:08.484 region:rollup2
ACCRUE THREE THOUSAND DOLLARS

01:13:06.549 --> 01:13:11.053 region:rollup2
WORTH OF DEBT. THAT TOOK ME

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:11.587 region:rollup2
THREE THREE YEARS TO PAY OFF I

01:13:11.053 --> 01:13:13.389 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY DIDN'T PAY IT OFF

01:13:11.587 --> 01:13:16.092 region:rollup2
UNTIL.

01:13:13.389 --> 01:13:17.793 region:rollup2
MY SECOND YEAR OF LAW SCHOOL.

01:13:16.092 --> 01:13:19.929 region:rollup2
AND BECAUSE OF THAT DEBT.

01:13:17.793 --> 01:13:21.163 region:rollup2
BECAUSE OF MY LACK OF ACCESS TO

01:13:19.929 --> 01:13:22.932 region:rollup2
THE CHAFEE GRANT BECAUSE OF MY

01:13:21.163 --> 01:13:24.400 region:rollup2
AGE.

01:13:22.932 --> 01:13:24.934 region:rollup2
IT TOOK AWAY SOME OPPORTUNITIES

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:27.370 region:rollup2

EDUCATIONAL EXPERIENCE.

01:13:31.707 --> 01:13:34.777 region:rollup2
FOR ME THE CHAFEE MEANS THE

01:13:33.109 --> 01:13:36.913 region:rollup2
ABILITY.

01:13:34.777 --> 01:13:40.016 region:rollup2
TO BE ABLE TO HAVE MONEY WITHOUT

THAT WHEN I WAS EMANCIPATED

THERE WERE NO BRIDGE PROGRAMS

01:15:12.475 --> 01:15:15.511 region:rollup2
FOR ME AT THAT TIME. I HAD TO

01:15:14.076 --> 01:15:16.078 region:rollup2

MY OWN.

01:16:07.430 --> 01:16:09.799 region:rollup2
FIRST I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT

01:16:08.464 --> 01:16:11.600 region:rollup2
ALUM REALLY PROUD TO BE

01:16:09.799 --> 01:16:13.269 region:rollup2
AFFILIATED WITH CRYSTAL BY BEING

01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:15.704 region:rollup2
UCLA GUARDIAN SCHOLAR.

01:16:13.269 --> 01:16:16.338 region:rollup2
WE'RE BOTH THERE TOGETHER AS

01:16:15.704 --> 01:16:16.806 region:rollup2
FORMER FOSTER YOUTH GETTING OUR

01:16:16.338 --> 01:16:19.508 region:rollup2
DEGREES.

01:16:16.806 --> 01:16:20.176 region:rollup2
AND.

01:16:19.508 --> 01:16:22.178 region:rollup2
BRIDGE PROGRAMS LIKE THAT ARE A

01:16:20.176 --> 01:16:23.879 region:rollup2
BIG DEAL I HAVE THREE VERY QUICK

01:16:22.178 --> 01:16:26.282 region:rollup2
POINTS IF YOU'LL INDULGE ME.

01:16:23.879 --> 01:16:28.117 region:rollup2
THERE ARE A WIDE RANGE OF SOCIAL

01:16:26.282 --> 01:16:28.617 region:rollup2
SERVICES HEALTH SERVICES AND

01:16:28.117 --> 01:16:31.020 region:rollup2
MENTAL HEALTH SERVICES.

01:16:28.617 --> 01:16:32.988 region:rollup2
THAT.

01:16:31.020 --> 01:16:34.023 region:rollup2
AS TRANSITION AGE YOUTH FORMER

01:16:32.988 --> 01:16:35.691 region:rollup2
FOSTER YOUTH GET UP UNTIL AGE

01:16:34.023 --> 01:16:36.358 region:rollup2
TWENTY SIX.

01:16:35.691 --> 01:16:37.793 region:rollup2
AND I KNOW THERE'S

01:16:36.358 --> 01:16:39.161 region:rollup2
REPRESENTATIVES HERE FROM CWD A

01:16:37.793 --> 01:16:42.064 region:rollup2
AND I SEE VALERIE IN THEY CAN

01:16:39.161 --> 01:16:43.833 region:rollup2
ATTEST TO WHY. THE SERVICES ARE

01:16:42.064 --> 01:16:46.535 region:rollup2
PROVIDED A FORMER FOSTER YOUTH

01:16:43.833 --> 01:16:47.736 region:rollup2
THEY EVEN GO TOWARDS ADMISSIONS.

01:16:46.535 --> 01:16:49.572 region:rollup2
WHY THEN DOES THE CHIEF GRANT

01:16:47.736 --> 01:16:51.106 region:rollup2
STOP AT TWENTY TWO?

01:16:49.572 --> 01:16:52.741 region:rollup2
SO THAT'S MY FIRST POINT

01:16:51.106 --> 01:16:54.443 region:rollup2
SECOND POINT IS THE ADDITIONAL

01:16:52.741 --> 01:16:56.645 region:rollup2
FOUR MILLION DOLLARS WE WOULD I

01:16:54.443 --> 01:16:58.747 region:rollup2
WOULD APPRECIATE BEING SOMEHOW

01:16:56.645 --> 01:17:00.483 region:rollup2
SET ASIDE BY RULE FOR THOSE

01:16:58.747 --> 01:17:02.151 region:rollup2
OLDER YOUTH WERE OVER THE AGE OF

01:17:00.483 --> 01:17:04.019 region:rollup2
TWENTY TWO.

01:17:02.151 --> 01:17:05.521 region:rollup2
AND THEN THE THIRD POINT IS THAT

01:17:04.019 --> 01:17:06.489 region:rollup2
IN THE CONSTELLATION OF ALL THE

01:17:05.521 --> 01:17:09.191 region:rollup2
MANY DIFFERENT FINANCIALLY

01:17:06.489 --> 01:17:10.359 region:rollup2
PROGRAMS.

01:17:09.191 --> 01:17:11.827 region:rollup2
ALMOST ALL OF THEM I THINK

01:17:10.359 --> 01:17:13.195 region:rollup2
ACTUALLY ALL OF THEM HINGED ON

01:17:11.827 --> 01:17:14.497 region:rollup2
SATISFACTORY ACADEMIC PROGRESS

01:17:13.195 --> 01:17:15.998 region:rollup2
WHEN WE SPEAK TO A THREE LEGGED

01:17:14.497 --> 01:17:16.198 region:rollup2
STOOL THAT OUR NEWEST ASSEMBLY

01:17:15.998 --> 01:17:18.167 region:rollup2
WOMAN.

01:17:16.198 --> 01:17:19.235 region:rollup2
MENTIONED.

01:17:18.167 --> 01:17:21.070 region:rollup2
IF THEY LOSE THE CHAFEE GRANT

01:17:19.235 --> 01:17:22.805 region:rollup2
THEY LOSE EVERYTHING.

01:17:21.070 --> 01:17:24.173 region:rollup2
SO IT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE ME

01:17:22.805 --> 01:17:25.708 region:rollup2
VERY HAPPY FOR MY YOUNGER

01:17:24.173 --> 01:17:27.109 region:rollup2

01:30:22.784 --> 01:30:25.020 region:rollup2
I WANTED TO ASK IF I COULD IF

01:30:23.385 --> 01:30:27.222 region:rollup2
THERE WAS.

01:30:25.020 --> 01:30:30.225 region:rollup2
I DO UNDERSTAND THE PRESENTATION

01:30:27.222 --> 01:30:31.927 region:rollup2
DUE TO THEIR ADVOCACY.

01:30:30.225 --> 01:30:33.395 region:rollup2
BUT I DO WONDER IF THERE IS A

01:30:31.927 --> 01:30:35.297 region:rollup2
FIRE WALL THAT MAY BE PUT IN

01:30:33.395 --> 01:30:36.765 region:rollup2
PLACE TO HELP.

01:30:35.297 --> 01:30:38.700 region:rollup2
PROVIDE THEM THE ADMINISTRATIVE

01:30:36.765 --> 01:30:39.634 region:rollup2
HELP THEY NEED WITH.

01:30:38.700 --> 01:30:41.736 region:rollup2
AND MAKING SURE THAT WE'RE

01:30:39.634 --> 01:30:42.337 region:rollup2
SEPARATING THEIR ADVOCACY FROM

01:30:41.736 --> 01:30:44.072 region:rollup2
THE WORK THAT YOU DO WITH THE

01:30:42.337 --> 01:30:45.640 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT. SO I THINK I WOULD

01:30:44.072 --> 01:30:46.141 region:rollup2
JUST TAKE THIS BACK AND THEN

01:30:45.640 --> 01:30:47.776 region:rollup2
I'LL DEFER DEPARTMENT OF

01:30:46.141 --> 01:30:50.211 region:rollup2
FINANCE.

01:30:47.776 --> 01:30:51.780 region:rollup2
BUT THE GOAL WAS FROM CFLS

01:30:50.211 --> 01:30:53.815 region:rollup2
PERSPECTIVE

01:30:51.780 --> 01:30:55.984 region:rollup2
FIND A LOCATION THAT WOULD BE

01:30:53.815 --> 01:30:57.953 region:rollup2
LESS COSTLY TO THEM IN TERMS OF

01:30:55.984 --> 01:30:59.854 region:rollup2
THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE SUPPORT.

01:30:57.953 --> 01:31:01.890 region:rollup2
FOR DEPARTMENT OF AGING TO BE

01:30:59.854 --> 01:31:04.025 region:rollup2
DOING THAT FOR A LESSER COST.

01:31:01.890 --> 01:31:06.294 region:rollup2
MEANS THAT WERE ACTUALLY USING

01:31:04.025 --> 01:31:07.762 region:rollup2
OUR OTHER FUNDING RESOURCES.

01:31:06.294 --> 01:31:09.831 region:rollup2
TO IN EFFECT

01:31:07.762 --> 01:31:11.833 region:rollup2
AUGMENT THE NEEDS.

01:31:09.831 --> 01:31:13.802 region:rollup2
OF THE SENIOR LEGISLATURE.

01:31:11.833 --> 01:31:16.204 region:rollup2
AND.

01:31:13.802 --> 01:31:18.907 region:rollup2
WE DO NOT HAVE THE RESOURCES TO

01:31:16.204 --> 01:31:21.242 region:rollup2
TO DO THAT TYPE OF AUGMENTATION.

01:31:18.907 --> 01:31:22.143 region:rollup2
SOME WOMEN RUBIO AYE.

01:31:21.242 --> 01:31:24.846 region:rollup2
I AM NEW HERE BUT.

01:31:22.143 --> 01:31:25.613 region:rollup2
.

01:31:24.846 --> 01:31:27.916 region:rollup2
I'M JUST LOOKING AT THE

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:29.751 region:rollup2
PRAGMATIC OR THE PRACTICAL

01:31:27.916 --> 01:31:31.853 region:rollup2
ISSUES LIKE HOUSING NOT

01:31:29.751 --> 01:31:33.421 region:rollup2
NECESSARILY HOW WOULD THAT TAKE

01:31:31.853 --> 01:31:35.290 region:rollup2
AWAY FROM YOUR FUNDING IF IT WAS

01:31:33.421 --> 01:31:37.092 region:rollup2
BASICALLY JUST AN OFFICE. I'M

01:31:35.290 --> 01:31:38.493 region:rollup2
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT. YOU

01:31:37.092 --> 01:31:40.695 region:rollup2
KNOW WHAT WE CAN DO.

01:31:38.493 --> 01:31:42.630 region:rollup2
SO I'M ENVISIONING THAT IT'S

01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:44.232 region:rollup2
MORE OF A HOUSING ISSUE. YOU

01:31:42.630 --> 01:31:45.867 region:rollup2
KNOW WHERE THOSE THE PERSON IS

01:31:44.232 --> 01:31:46.868 region:rollup2
PLACED AND IF YOU ALREADY HAVE A

01:31:45.867 --> 01:31:48.436 region:rollup2
BUILDING I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW

01:31:46.868 --> 01:31:50.572 region:rollup2
THAT WOULD TAKE AWAY FROM YOUR

01:31:48.436 --> 01:31:52.741 region:rollup2
OWN. EYE THAT I'M JUST BEING

01:31:50.572 --> 01:31:55.043 region:rollup2
PRACTICAL HERE AND SO SO IF YOU

01:31:52.741 --> 01:31:56.745 region:rollup2
CAN EXPLAIN THAT TO ME. I'M IN

01:31:55.043 --> 01:31:58.046 region:rollup2
TERMS OF A FIREWALL I APPRECIATE

01:31:56.745 --> 01:32:00.515 region:rollup2
THAT THE YOU CAN SEPARATE THE

01:31:58.046 --> 01:32:01.216 region:rollup2
ISSUES BUT I'M THINKING HOUSING

01:32:00.515 --> 01:32:03.017 region:rollup2
WISE.

01:32:01.216 --> 01:32:05.320 region:rollup2
THAT WOULDN'T NECESSARILY TAKE

01:32:03.017 --> 01:32:06.588 region:rollup2
AWAY BUT EXPLAIN IT.

01:32:05.320 --> 01:32:08.556 region:rollup2

APPROACHING FINANCE WILL

01:32:09.090 --> 01:32:11.593 region:rollup2

THEY NEED PERSONNEL.

01:32:27.308 --> 01:32:31.980 region:rollup2
DEALING WITH PERSONNEL ISSUES

01:32:28.843 --> 01:32:34.182 region:rollup2

BEING CHARGED BY DEPARTMENT

GENERAL SERVICES.

01:33:03.378 --> 01:33:06.614 region:rollup2
THE STANDARD RATE FOR THOSE

01:33:04.913 --> 01:33:07.882 region:rollup2
SERVICES THAT WOULD BE WHAT.

01:33:06.614 --> 01:33:09.384 region:rollup2
PRESUMABLY DEPARTMENT OF FIGHT

01:33:07.882 --> 01:33:11.486 region:rollup2

BE REQUIRING AS WELL AND THE

01:33:11.486 --> 01:33:14.422 region:rollup2
OTHER BY I THINK ONE OF THE

01:33:12.821 --> 01:33:17.325 region:rollup2
ISSUES FROM THEIR BCP WAS THAT

01:33:14.422 --> 01:33:19.661 region:rollup2
THEY DIDN'T WANT. ARM TO HAVE TO

01:33:17.325 --> 01:33:21.529 region:rollup2
COVER THE STAFFING INCREASED

01:33:19.661 --> 01:33:23.631 region:rollup2
COSTS FOR THAT POSITION THEY

01:33:21.529 --> 01:33:24.532 region:rollup2
WANTED KIND OF THE. WAIVER FROM

01:33:23.631 --> 01:33:26.301 region:rollup2
HAVING TO DO THAT.

01:33:24.532 --> 01:33:28.269 region:rollup2
MOVING FORWARD IN TERMS OF

THEIR BUDGET.

01:33:28.269 --> 01:33:32.040 region:rollup2
WE WOULD HAVE NO AUTHORITY TO

01:33:29.838 --> 01:33:33.708 region:rollup2
NOT DO THAT AND AS A SOMEONE IS

01:33:32.040 --> 01:33:35.643 region:rollup2
ENOUGH THAT SOMEONE. AND WE'D

01:33:33.708 --> 01:33:37.745 region:rollup2
HAVE TO ABSORB THE COSTS IF THEY

01:33:35.643 --> 01:33:39.814 region:rollup2
WERE. AT AT THOSE COSTS WERE WAY

01:33:37.745 --> 01:33:40.915 region:rollup2
FOR SOME REASON.

01:33:39.814 --> 01:33:42.217 region:rollup2
REFER TO FINANCE WE ARE MORE

01:33:40.915 --> 01:33:43.918 region:rollup2
DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE WE'VE HAD

01:33:42.217 --> 01:33:45.220 region:rollup2
CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS WITH

DEPARTMENT OF AGING BUT AT THAT

01:33:52.927 --> 01:33:57.132 region:rollup2
NUMBER OF OTHER KIND OF MODELS

01:33:54.496 --> 01:33:58.733 region:rollup2
AND ENTITIES IN THE STATE. AND

01:33:57.132 --> 01:34:00.235 region:rollup2
THE THE ULTIMATE KIND OF

01:33:58.733 --> 01:34:01.569 region:rollup2
CONCLUSION IS THAT PICKED CUP

01:34:00.235 --> 01:34:09.677 region:rollup2
CONTRACTOR FISCAL SERVICES WHICH

01:34:01.569 --> 01:34:10.745 region:rollup2

01:34:10.745 --> 01:34:14.916 region:rollup2
AND DO THIS WORK SIGNIFICANTLY

01:34:12.914 --> 01:34:16.951 region:rollup2
THAT LAST COST AND GENERALLY

01:34:14.916 --> 01:34:17.685 region:rollup2
CANNOT ABSORB THAT COST BY THEIR

01:34:16.951 --> 01:34:19.087 region:rollup2
OWN WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL

01:34:17.685 --> 01:34:20.855 region:rollup2

AND IT ALREADY HAS THAT BUILT IN

01:34:23.892 --> 01:34:26.594 region:rollup2
FIREWALL BECAUSE IT DOESN'T DEAL

01:34:25.293 --> 01:34:28.263 region:rollup2
WITH THE.

01:34:26.594 --> 01:34:29.497 region:rollup2

HAVE.

01:34:33.601 --> 01:34:37.238 region:rollup2

THIS IS A NORMAL EXPERIENCE A I

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:22.516 region:rollup2
WANT TO EMPHASIZE NORMAL THAT IS

01:40:21.215 --> 01:40:24.552 region:rollup2
SO VITAL FOR A HEALTHY CHILD

01:40:22.516 --> 01:40:26.087 region:rollup2
CHILD DEVELOPMENT AND YET IT IS

01:40:24.552 --> 01:40:27.889 region:rollup2
SO OFTEN DENIED.

01:40:26.087 --> 01:40:30.224 region:rollup2
FOSTER YOU BECAUSE OF COST

01:40:27.889 --> 01:40:31.859 region:rollup2
ANOTHER BARRIERS.

01:40:30.224 --> 01:40:34.128 region:rollup2
CALIFORNIA AND FEDERAL LAWS

01:40:31.859 --> 01:40:36.397 region:rollup2

ACTIVITIES.

01:40:40.134 --> 01:40:45.039 region:rollup2
YET COST IS A KEY BARRIER.

01:40:42.904 --> 01:40:47.208 region:rollup2
FOR EXAMPLE AND ACTIVITY COULD

01:40:45.039 --> 01:40:49.644 region:rollup2
COST SOMETHING LIKE SIX HUNDRED

01:40:47.208 --> 01:40:50.845 region:rollup2
DOLLARS LET'S SAY. AND IF YOU'VE

01:40:49.644 --> 01:40:52.647 region:rollup2
GOT A COUPLE OF CHILDREN IN YOUR

01:40:50.845 --> 01:40:54.081 region:rollup2
FAMILY AND THEY WANT TO ENGAGE

01:40:52.647 --> 01:40:55.349 region:rollup2
IN MULTIPLE ACTIVITIES YOU CAN

01:40:54.081 --> 01:40:58.286 region:rollup2
SEE HOW THAT ADDS UP VERY

01:40:55.349 --> 01:40:59.253 region:rollup2
QUICKLY. I'M AN EXISTING FOSTER

01:40:58.286 --> 01:41:01.923 region:rollup2

01:41:01.923 --> 01:41:05.793 region:rollup2
THE FOSTER CARE PAYMENTS

01:41:03.357 --> 01:41:06.260 region:rollup2
DOES NOT EXPLICITLY GO TOWARDS

01:41:05.793 --> 01:41:08.896 region:rollup2
THESE EXTRACURRICULAR

01:41:06.260 --> 01:41:11.332 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES.

01:41:08.896 --> 01:41:13.768 region:rollup2
SO ALTHOUGH OUR LAWS.

01:41:11.332 --> 01:41:15.469 region:rollup2
REQUIRED PARTICIPATION.

01:41:13.768 --> 01:41:16.370 region:rollup2
WE'RE NOT REALLY PUTTING OUR

01:41:15.469 --> 01:41:18.372 region:rollup2
MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTHS ARE ON

01:41:16.370 --> 01:41:20.574 region:rollup2
THIS ONE.

01:41:18.372 --> 01:41:22.076 region:rollup2
TO QUOTE ONE FOSTER PARENT.

01:41:20.574 --> 01:41:24.145 region:rollup2
IT'S ALMOST OFFENSIVE FOR

01:41:22.076 --> 01:41:26.113 region:rollup2
SOMEONE TO SAY IT'S SO IMPORTANT

01:41:24.145 --> 01:41:27.548 region:rollup2
FOR YOU TO ENROLL THEM.

01:41:26.113 --> 01:41:30.251 region:rollup2
BUT IT'S GOING TO COST YOU YOUR

01:41:27.548 --> 01:41:31.552 region:rollup2
WHOLE BUDGET FOR THE WHOLE YEAR.

01:41:30.251 --> 01:41:33.354 region:rollup2

01:41:31.552 --> 01:41:35.089 region:rollup2

01:41:33.354 --> 01:41:37.925 region:rollup2
ACTIVITIES ARE TO NORMALCY AND

01:41:35.089 --> 01:41:39.293 region:rollup2
WELL BEING. FOR FOSTER YOUTH BUT

01:41:37.925 --> 01:41:41.395 region:rollup2
OUR PAYMENT STRUCTURES DO NOT

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:43.731 region:rollup2
SUPPORT CARE GIVERS PROVIDING

01:41:41.395 --> 01:41:45.199 region:rollup2
THESE VITAL ACTIVITIES.

01:41:43.731 --> 01:41:47.201 region:rollup2
AND YET WE'VE HEARD ALREADY

01:41:45.199 --> 01:41:48.936 region:rollup2
ABOUT THE POTENTIAL BENEFITS OF

01:41:47.201 --> 01:41:51.138 region:rollup2
THESE ACTIVITIES I'M JUST GONNA

01:41:48.936 --> 01:41:52.707 region:rollup2
GIVE A COUPLE OF. EXAMPLES GOING

01:41:51.138 --> 01:41:54.742 region:rollup2
A LITTLE DEEPER INTO THE

01:41:52.707 --> 01:41:56.410 region:rollup2
RESEARCH AND WHAT IT SAYS.

01:41:54.742 --> 01:41:58.145 region:rollup2
YOUTH PARTICIPATION IN AFTER

01:41:56.410 --> 01:41:59.480 region:rollup2
