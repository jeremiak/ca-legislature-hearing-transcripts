CORKERY SOME REAL ONE TWENTY EIGHT BY ASSEMBLYMEMBER TING ACCORDING TO THE STATE BUDGET SIGNIFICANT NEARLY BUDGET BILL MISTER KANE YOU MAY OPEN THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I'M RISING TODAY VERY PROUD TO INTRODUCE A RECORD AND VERY HISTORIC BUDGET. IT WAS ONLY LAST YEAR THAT WE STOOD HERE. BARELY A FEW MONTHS INTO OUR COBIT PANDEMIC. WE WERE LOOKING AT A HISTORIC FIFTY BILLION DOLLAR DEFICIT WE REALLY WEREN'T SURE WHAT WAS GONNA HAPPEN TO OUR ECONOMY. WE WEREN'T SURE HOW LONG WE WOULD BE IN THIS PANDEMIC AND WHAT. DEVASTATION IT MIGHT DO TO OUR POPULATION. TO OUR BUSINESSES TO OUR SCHOOLS TO ALL THE VARIOUS INSTITUTIONS THAT WE HOLD DEAR IN OUR STATE. TODAY I AM PROUD TO RISE IN PRESENT FOR A BUDGET. THAT IS A RECORD BUDGET IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. IT IS A TWO HUNDRED AND SIXTY SEVEN BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR GENERAL FUND. A RECORD TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN RESERVE WITH THE GOAL OF A THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLAR RESERVE BY TWENTY TWENTY FOUR TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THIS IS IN CONTRAST TO LAST YEAR'S RESERVE WHICH WAS ONLY FOURTEEN BILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE PAYING OFF ELEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN PROP NINETY DEFERRALS BY EIGHT POINT ONE BILLION IN OUR SECOND ROUND OF THE GOLDEN STATE STIMULUS. ONE POINT FIVE BILLION IN SMALL BUSINESS AND NONPROFIT GRANTS. TWO BILLION DOLLARS IN SMALL BUSINESS UNEMPLOYMENT. TAX CREDITS FOR. TO HELP MITIGATE THE INCREASE IN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE. THIS BUDGET THAT I'M PRESENTING IS PART OF A ROBUST BUDGET PROCESS EVEN DURING COVERT WHEN MANY TIMES WE HAD TO DO HEARINGS WITH REMOTE PARTICIPATION. WE HAD TO DO HEARINGS WHERE WE HAD TO WORK AROUND- COMMITTEE SCHEDULES WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO HOLD SIXTY TWO BUDGET HEARINGS AND I DISSIPATE THAT BY THE END OF THE YEAR THAT WILL BE HAVING UPWARDS OF ALMOST ONE HUNDRED HEARINGS. TO DISCUSS THIS VERY SIZEABLE INVESTMENT IN OUR STATE. HOUSING AND HOMELESSNESS WERE THE TOP ISSUES BEFORE WE WENT INTO THIS PANDEMIC AND THEY REMAIN SOME OF THE TOP ISSUES TODAY. IN THIS BUDGET. THIRTY EIGHT AND A HALF BILLION DOLLARS OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW HOMELESSNESS FUNDING. THERE'S A BILLION DOLLARS ON GOING I THOUGHT THAT A BILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS FOR FLEXIBLE SPENDING TO HELP THEM ATTACK. THE PROBLEM OF HOMELESSNESS IN THEIR COMMUNITY. THERE'S TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR AFFORDABLE HOUSING BECAUSE FAR TOO FEW PEOPLE. CAN AFFORD TO PURCHASE A HOME OR EVEN RENT A HOME IN THIS PARTICULAR STATE. IN TERMS OF HEALTHCARE WE THOUGHT HOW IMPORTANT IT WAS. TO HAVE HEALTHCARE. OVER THE LAST. THIRTEEN TO FIFTEEN MONTHS. DURING A PANDEMIC WE SAW THE FISSURES IN THE CRACKS WITHIN OUR PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. SO WE WANT TO EXPAND MEDICARE ALL TO EVERYONE IN THE STATE FIFTY EIGHT OVER REGARDLESS OF IMMIGRATION STATUS. WE WANT TO REMOVE THIS AWFUL MEDICARE ACID TEST THAT MAKES IT MAKES IT IMPOSSIBLE IF YOU OWN ANYTHING TO BE A MEDIC CAL. WE WANT TO INVEST IN OUR YOUTH AND THEIR BEHAVIORAL HEALTH A FOUR BILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT THE YOUTH BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. IT ALSO TO WORK COUNTY PARTNERS WE ARE HERE TO BE WITH YOU TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR ONGOING INVESTMENT FOR PUBLIC COUNTY. HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE. IN EDUCATION IT'S A RECORD AMOUNT OF FUNDING TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER PUPIL THE HIGHEST AMOUNT IN THE STATE'S HISTORY. FOR STUDENTS STRUGGLING OR HOPING TO GET INTO UC AND CSU WERE INCREASING AEROBIC CAPACITY BY FIFTEEN THOUSAND STUDENTS FOR FIFTEEN THOUSAND MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO ATTEND THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA AND TO CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY BECAUSE- OF THIS BUDGET. ONLY 25% OF THE STUDENTS IN THE STATE TO ATTEND TO CARE THAT IS CHANGING WE ARE NOW FACING IN A FULL TWO K. BE ABLE TO. BE ABLE TO ATTEND T. K. BY THE TIME. THIS BUDGET HAS BEEN FULLY IMPLEMENTED. AND LASTLY IN EDUCATION. FAMILIES CAN'T GO BACK TO WORK IF THERE'S NO CHILD CARE SO WE'RE ADDING ADDITIONAL TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE SLOTS FOR CHILD CARE PLUS. FOR ALL THE CHILD CARE. FOR ALL THE CHILD CARE CENTERS WHO HAD SUCH A HARD TIME THIS LAST YEAR WE HEAR YOUR PAIN WE'RE INCREASING THE RATES OF REIMBURSEMENT TO REALLY HELPFUL CENTERS GET BACK ON THEIR FEET. IN TERMS OF HOLE HUMAN SERVICES WE HEARD. THAT NOT EVERY CALIFORNIAN. I WAS DOING OKAY BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC SO MANY WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING. WE'RE DOING THE RESTORATION OF SIX HUNDRED MILLION TO SS I SS P. WE ARE FINALLY. FINALLY GOING TO IMPLEMENT OUR DEVELOPMENTAL SERVICES RATE STUDY AND THIS IS A BIG FIRST STEP OVER EIGHT HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS THIS YEAR WITH THE GOAL TO GET OVER THAT RATE STUDY THRESHOLD. IN THE NEXT THREE YEARS. FOR ALL OF US WHO RELY ON IN HOME SUPPORT SERVICES TO CARE FOR OUR LOVED ONES AND OUR FAMILIES BUT THEY DON'T HAVE TO GO TO A NURSING HOME WE'RE DEFINITELY RESTORING THAT 7% CUT. THAT WE TALKED ABOUT A COUPLE YEARS AGO. IN TERMS OF CRIMINAL JUSTICE AT THE SYSTEM THAT IS BROKEN. IT DOESN'T DO ITS PART IN TERMS OF ENSURING THAT PEOPLE WHO GO IN COME OUT BETTER SO WE'RE INVESTING IN REHABILITATION OVER TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. WE'RE INSURING. THAT LOW INCOME FAMILIES ALSO GET THE ASSISTANCE THEY NEED THEY'RE SADDLED WITH DEBT WITH MANY OF THESE FEES WITH MANY OF THESE PENALTIES SO WE ARE WORKING TO REMOVE MANY OF THE PENALTIES THAT THEY ARE FACING. WAVING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF PENALTIES SO THEY CAN GET THOSE SHACKLES REMOVED. FROM THEIR BODIES. TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS TO REDUCE GUN VIOLENCE FOR THOSE CRITICAL COMMUNITY ORGANIZATIONS. THAT REALLY HAVE BEEN ON THE FOREFRONT OF REDUCING GUN VIOLENCE HERE IN OUR STATE. AND LASTLY OUR COURT SYSTEM IS AN EQUAL PARTNER IN OUR BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT WERE MAKING AN OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR INVESTMENT OR REINVESTMENT. IN OUR COURT SYSTEM AFTER SUCH A VERY VERY DIFFICULT YEARS. LASTLY WE HAVE A NUMBER HUGE INVESTMENTS. BILLION DOLLARS FOR WILDFIRES THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR DROUGHT WE KNOW THAT THIS IS ONE OF THE DRIEST YEARS IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY THREE POINT SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS IN CLIMATE WE KNOW THAT IF WE DON'T MANAGE CLIMATE CHANGE TO REVERSE THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WE'RE GOING TO BE FIGHTING FIRES FOR YEARS. SEVEN BILLION DOLLARS FOR BROADBAND BILLION DOLLARS BECAUSE FOR ECT K. TWELVE FACILITIES BECAUSE IF WE DON'T BUILD THE CLASSROOMS WE CAN'T GET TICKETS EXPANDED AND WE CAN'T EXPAND PRESCHOOL AND LASTLY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS FOR HIGHER EDUCATION FOR HOUSING AS WELL AS EXPANSION BECAUSE WITH SO MANY STUDENTS. GOING TO ATTEND COLLEGE WE DID MAKE SURE THERE'S ROOM FOR THEM THE PLA PLACE FOR THEM. TO LIVE. LET ME JUST WRAP UP I JUST THANKING. EVERYBODY WHO HELPED PUT THIS BUDGET TOGETHER. THIS IS DEFINITELY A LEGISLATIVE TEAM EFFORT. EVERYBODY ON THIS FLOOR EVERY MEMBER OF PARTICIPATING HEARINGS ALL THE STAFF. HAVE HAD A HUGE ROLE IN PUTTING TOGETHER THIS HISTORIC BUDGET LET ME JUST THINK FIRST. OUR VICE CHAIR MISTER FALL. REALLY APPRECIATE ALL OF HIS. ALL OF HIS GUIDANCE AND ALL OF HIS COOPERATION OVER THE LAST YEAR. ME JUST THANK OUR FIVE TEACHER ARE FAR SOLDIERS. DR ARAMBULA CARTY MISTER BLOOM. MISS CARILLO AND MISS GARCIA FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK OVER THE LAST FEW MONTHS. LET ME THINK. THIS THE TEAM OUR STAFF JESUS IS THE IN THE SPEAKER'S OFFICE CHRISTIAN GRIFFITH OUR CHIEF CONSULTANT OUR TIRE ASSEMBLY BUDGET STAFF AS WELL AS MY PERSONAL STUFF YOU PUT IN SO MANY HOURS. INTO THIS BUDGET. ME ALSO THANK OCHEN STOCK IN THE REPUBLICAN FISCAL TEAM FOR ALL THE TIME THAT THEY'VE INVESTED IN MAKING SURE THAT THIS BUDGETIS AS GOOD AS COULD BE. I ALSO WANT TO THANK SENATOR SKINNER WHO JUST GOT DONE PRESENTING OUR BUDGET AS WELL AS HER ENTIRE SENATE BUDGET STOP. ALL I'M GONNA THINK OUR INCREDIBLE FINANCE TEAM DOWNSTAIRS FOR ALL THE INCREDIBLE WORK THEY DO. ARE WE ARE STILL HAVING ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN COME TO AN AGREEMENT. FOR WORK I JUSTWANT TO THANK THEM FOR THE HOURS THAT THEY PUT INTO THIS BUDGET. BUT ALSO THE HOURS THEY PUT INTO EACH OF THE EARLY TRAILER BILLS EARLY THIS YEAR'S AROUND SCHOOLS. RUMBLE THE STATE'S STIMULUS AROUND WILDFIRES. AND LET ME JUST THANK THE BACKBONE OF OUR- ASSEMBLY AS WELL WHETHER DOUBTS ARE LDC ARE SIMPLY TV OR LARGE COUNCIL OR SERGEANTS. AND NOW A NEW. ADDED PART OF OUR FAMILY OUR EIGHTEEN T. OPERATORS THIS YEAR WOULD BE THE SAME WITHOUT THE EIGHTEEN T. OPERATORS. ARM MEMBERS THIS IS A BUDGET THAT I BELIEVE WE WILL LOOK BACK OUT VERY PROUDLY. IT'S A HUGE OPPORTUNITY TO INVEST OUR STATE NOT JST NEXT YEAR BUT REALLY. FOR THE NEXT FIFTY YEARS. IS LAYS THE FOUNDATION TOWARDS EDUCATION TO HELP THOSE THAT NEED THE HELP THE MOST. IT INSURERS THAT FAMILIES ARE GETTING OFF TO A STRONG START AND THEY HAVE EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO SUCCEED IN THE STATE. WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK VOTE ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE ON A. B. ONE TWENTY EIGHT ARE BUDGET BILL. THANK YOU RICH TANK MR FONG YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. I THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. A MEMBERS THE COVERT NINETEEN PANDEMIC. IT'S AN FAMILIES HAVE STRUGGLED AND PERSEVERED OUR SMALL BUSINESSES HAVE FOUGHT TO SURVIVE WITH CONTINUOUS UNCERTAINTY OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE ENDURED CHALLENGE AFTER CHALLENGE HOW WE CRAFT THE STATE BUDGET HAS TREMENDOUS IMPLICATIONS THERE ARE PROPOSALS IN THIS BUDGET THAT ARE NECESSARY AND HAVE MERIT. INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC HEALTH BROADBAND ELIMINATING DEBT INCURRED BY OUR SCHOOL DISTRICTS SUPPORT FOR THE DEVELOPMENTALLY DISABLED COMMUNITY AND EMERGENCY FUNDING FOR SPECIAL DISTRICTS THROUGHOUT OUR STATE. CERTAINLY THE BUDGET JEFF IN THE BAY AREA AND I OUR EGGS EXPERIENCING A BUDGET CYCLE UNLIKE ANY OTHER WE'VE SEEN IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY. AND I APPRECIATE THE CIRCUMSTANCES AND PRESSURES THAT HE HAS HAD TO NAVIGATE AND TO NAVIGATE. THE COLLEAGUES I HAVE SERIOUS RESERVATIONS TO AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT. TOO OFTEN. WE FALL INTO THE COMMON MENTALITY. TO EVALUATE PROGRAMS BASED ON THE AMOUNT WE SPEND. INSTEAD OF RESULTS OF WHAT WE ARE TRYING TO ACHIEVE. THIS BILL ADMITTEDLY STILL LACKS IMPORTANT DETAILS. DETAILS THAT WILL DETERMINE WHETHER PROGRAMS WILL ACTUALLY WORK OR NOT. MANY WILL TOUT THE SIZE OF THIS BUDGET. OVERLOOKING THE NEED FOR A VITAL STRUCTURAL REFORMS TO CRITICAL PROGRAMS THAT ARE CURRENTLY IN EFFECTIVE. POURING LARGE AMOUNTS OF MONEY INTO PROGRAMS THAT ARE FUNDAMENTALLY FLAWED OR MISMANAGED IS A RECIPE FOR DISASTER. CREATING MORE PROGRAMS AND EXPANDING ONGOING SERVICES WITH A ONE TIME DOLLARS. IS NOT SENSIBLE AND I THINK MANY WOULD AGREE THIS IS NOT RECOMMENDED. CALIFORNIANS EXPECT US TO FIX THE MANY BROKEN SYSTEMS IN OUR STATE GOVERNMENT TO FOCUS RESPONSIBLY ON THE CONTINUOUS DANGERS OF CASH EVERY WILDFIRES AND NOW WORSENING DROUGHT AN OUTDATED ENERGY GRID AND TO HAVE A REAL AND THOUGHTFUL DEBATE ON PERMANENT TAX RELIEF FOR CALIFORNIANS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT. HOW TO LIVE AND WORK IN OUR STATE WAY MEDIUM HOME COST OVER SEVEN HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS. IN FACT WELL I AND MANY OPPOSED TO TAX INCREASES IN DEFERRALS OF IMPORTANT TAX CREDITS MADE LAST YEAR. IT WOULD BE REASONABLE TO LOOK AT I'M DOING THOSE ACTIONS NOW THAT WE HAVE A DIFFERENT BUDGET OUTLOOK BUT THOSE TAX INCREASES UNFORTUNATELY REMAIN. IT GOES WITHOUT SAYING THAT OUR STATE'S UNEMPLOYMENT SYSTEM IS FUNDAMENTALLY BROKEN. THE EDT SYSTEM CANNOT FUNCTION WITH ANY SEMBLANCE OF COMPETENCE IN CALIFORNIA HAS INCURRED A DEBT OF TWENTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS IN THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FUND. A DEBT THAT IF IT IS NOT ADDRESSED IN A SIGNIFICANT AND SUBSTANTIAL WAY WILL LEAD TO HIGHER TAXES PAID FOR AND BY ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING SMALL BUSINESSES. LESTAT WAS INCURRED BECAUSE OF THE MISMANAGEMENT OF STATE GOVERNMENT NOT BY OUR LOCAL SMALL BUSINESSES. THE LACK OF ACTION WILL ONLY LEAD TO A LARGER TAX BURDEN THAT HARD WORKING CALIFORNIANS WILL HAVE TO BEAR IN THE FUTURE. THIS IS UNDENIABLE. CALIFORNIA IS FACING A SEVERE DROUGHT IN OUR WATER SUPPLY IS QUICKLY DWINDLING. FOLSOM LAKE FOR EXAMPLE HASN'T SEEN WATER LEVELS THIS LOW SINCE NINETEEN SEVENTY SEVEN. THE STATE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE IS CRUMBLING AS WE ENTER ANOTHER DROUGHT AND FIRE SEASON. THIS BUDGET STILL DOES NOT PROVIDE ANY ASSURANCES OF NEEDED WATER STORAGE. WE HAVE SEEN THAT MORE SAVINGS IS MORE PRUDENT THAN MORE SPENDING BUT NEITHER THE GOVERNOR NOR THIS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSAL SEEKS TO REPLENISH THE MONEY WITHDRAWN FROM THE STATE'S SAVING A SAVINGS ACCOUNT SOMETHING THAT WE MUST DO. THE NONPARTISAN L. A. L. AS EVEN TOLD US USING TOOLS DESIGNED FOR A BUDGET CRISIS TO SUPPORT STATE SPENDING AT THIS TIME IS SHORT SIGHTED AND IT INVIOLABLE. MEMBERS I WOULD ARGUE THAT INSTEAD OF USING THE BUDGETS FRAMEWORK THIS BUDGET FRAMEWORK AS A SPENDING SPREE. WE NEED TO EVALUATE THIS PROPOSAL AS WELL AS FUTURE PROPOSALS AS A MANAGEMENT PLAN. JUDGED BY RESULTS AND ACCOUNTABILITY WE HAVE SEEN THE VOLATILITY AND UNCERTAINTY IN BUDGET PROJECTIONS LOOKS CAN BE DECEIVING THIS BUDGET IS LARGE BUT THERE ARE SERIOUS CONCERNS THAT THIS BUDGET IS UNSUSTAINABLE WE NEED TO FOCUS ON THE BASICS AND DEMAND RESULTS BEFORE WE POUR BILLIONS OF DOLLARS. OF PRECIOUS TAX DOLLARS INTO MORE NEW PROGRAMS AND A BROKEN SYSTEMS WITH NO STRUCTURAL REFORMS AND FOR THAT REASON I CANNOT SUPPORT THE PATH THAT THIS BUDGET LEADS OUR STATE DOWN. URGENT ABOUT. THANK YOU MR FONG MISS CLARK SILVA. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS MEMBERS TODAY I RISE AND ASK US TO REFLECT BACK JUST A YEAR AGO. A YEAR AGO WHEN OUR STATE WAS SHUT DOWN WHEN WE WERE LOSING THOUSANDS OF JOBS. AND THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WERE DYING ACROSS OUR COUNTRY. AND TO THINK THAT JUST TOMORROW WE ARE GOING TO BE RE OPENING. THAT WE ARE SEEING NOT ONLY RE OPENING RESILIENCY RECOVERING REBOUNDING AND WE ARE ROARING BACK. I WANT TO SPEAK TO TWO PARTS OF THIS BUDGET THAT MEANS SO MUCH TO ME SOME OF YOU HAVE HEARD MAYBE THE BROKEN RECORD ABOUT HOMELESSNESS. BECAUSE THAT IS THE ONE AREA THAT WE AGREE AS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS THAT WE NEED TO DO MORE IN THIS BUDGET IS DOING EXACTLY THAT WE ARE PROVIDING ONE BILLION DOLLARS OF ONGOING AND FLEXIBLE FUNDING TO AID LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS. WE'RE PROVIDING ONE POINT TWO BILLION DOLLARS FOR PROJECT HOME KEY FOR THOSE CITIES THAT CHOOSE TO USE MOTELS OR HOTELS FOR HOMELESSNESS AND IN MY OWN COUNTY STANTON DECIDED TO DO THAT AND THEY'RE ALREADY BUILDING TO HOUSE THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE READY. FOR THEIR OWN PLACE TO LIVE. IN ADDITION THERE IS A ONE POINT SEVEN FIVE BILLION TO ALLEVIATE THE BACKLOG IN AFFORDABLE HOUSING CONSTRUCTION. AND MUCH MORE WE KNOW THAT DOLLARS ARE NOT THE ONLY WAY TO SOLVE HOMELESSNESS IT TAKES LOCAL JURISDICTIONS IT TAKES THE COUNTY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND US NEIGHBORS PEOPLE IN OUR COMMUNITY SAYING YES. SAYING THAT IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO SEND DOLLARS BUT WE HAVE TO WORK TOGETHER TO NOT ALLOW PEOPLE TO SLEEP ON OUR CORNERS IN STREETS IT'S THAT SIMPLE WORKING TOGETHER. ANOTHER PART OF THE BUDGET IT'S VERY EXCITING TO ME IS MONEY THAT'S GOING TO BE PUT TOWARDS CALIFORNIA ARTS NOW THE SEEM TO BE VERY DIFFERENT TOPICS ARTS AND HOMELESSNESS. AND YET WE KNOW THAT CALIFORNIA IS ONE OF THE MOST CREATIVE ECONOMIES OUT THERE NOT ONLY OUR THEATERS OUR MUSIC OUR MOTION PICTURES BUT ALSO THE ARTIST THE ARTIST THAT I BROUGHT TO LIFE OUR COMMUNITIES. JUST THIS WEEK IN IN THE HEIGHTS WAS RELEASED AND THIS PICTURE MUSICAL MOVIE. IS A TRIBUTE TO BEAUTIFUL FAMILIES THAT HAVE IMMIGRATED TO OUR GREAT USA SO I'M EXCITED TO SEE ONE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS GOING TOWARDS THE CALIFORNIA OUT ARTS COUNCIL GRANTS THAT CAN BE USED ACROSS OUR STATE FOR ALL OF THOSE CREATIVE INDIVIDUALS AND THEIR- THEIR ORGANIZATIONS IN ADDITION FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS. FOR THE ARTS COUNCIL IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LABOR AND WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT AGAIN TO SUPPORT THOSE JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST THAT WE KNOW. BRING THAT VIBRANT COLOR TO OUR COMMUNITY SO I RISE IN SUPPORT AND ASK YOU TO SUPPORT. AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT. THANK YOU MISS SILVA DOT RANDY. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS THIS BUDGET DOES NOT RETURN OUR STATE BACK TO NORMAL RATHER IT'S BOLDNESS LEADS US TO A STRONGER AND BETTER CALIFORNIA FOR ALL. THE CALIFORNIA THAT LEAVES NO ONE BEHIND BY INVESTING IN EVERY CALIFORNIA ESPECIALLY OUR MOST VULNERABLE. UNDERSTANDING THAT THE PANDEMIC DID NOT HIT US ALL EQUALLY OUR LEADERS AND SURE IN THIS BUDGET THAT SMART INVESTMENTS TODAY. CONTINUE TO LEAD US TOWARDS EQUITY. AS THE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET SUB COMMITTEE NUMBER ONE ON HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES I AM GRATEFUL THAT THIS BUDGET DIRECTS THE BOUNTIFUL RESOURCE IN IT. TOWARDS THOSE THAT NEED THEM THE MOST WE MAKE MAJOR INVESTMENTS IN OUR SOCIAL SERVICE PROGRAMS AND MOST OF WHAT YOU SEE IN THIS OUR PLANS AND PRIORITIES THAT CHAMPIONS AND ADVOCATES HAVE BEEN WORKING ON FOR YEARS. THESE INVESTMENTS ENSURE THAT ALL OF OUR COMMUNITIES CAN MEET BASIC NEEDS FEED THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN AND BE CARED FOR AND RECEIVE SUPPORT WHEN THEY FACE TRAUMA INTERGENERATIONAL POVERTY UNEMPLOYMENT DISEASE OR DISABILITY. I AM PROUD TO ANNOUNCE THAT THIS BUDGET BEFORE US TODAY PROVIDE STABILITY FOR THOSE WITH INTELLECTUAL AND DEVELOPMENTAL DISABILITIES WHO SYSTEM HAS BEEN ROCKED BY KOBE AND HAS BEEN HISTORICALLY UNDER FUNDED. BY FUNDING THE DDS RATE STUDY WE WILL FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THE LAND SHERMAN ACT ON WHICH SO MANY RELY TO LIVE A FULL SAFE AND DIGNIFIED LIFE IN OUR COMMUNITY. WE MAKE CRITICAL CHANGES TO MODERNIZE THE CAL WORKS PROGRAM SO THAT IT CAN PROVIDE REAL TRAUMA INFORMED SUPPORT TO PARENTS AND THEIR CHILDREN IN THE SAFETY NET PROGRAM. THIS POWERFUL PROGRAM CAN BREAK THE CYCLE OF POVERTY SO THAT THESE PARENTS AND CHILDREN HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY. TO LIVE THE CALIFORNIA DREAM. YEAH OF LIVING IN THE BREAD BASKET OF THE WORLD IS THOSE WHO WORKED SO DILIGENTLY TO PUT FOOD ON OUR TABLES. TOO OFTEN FACE FOOD INSECURITY THEMSELVES. THE SOLUTION TO FIGHTING HUNGER AT RECORD LEVELS IN CALIFORNIA IS TO PROVIDE STRONG INVESTMENTS IN OUR EMERGENCY FOOD INFRASTRUCTURE. THIS BUDGET PROVIDES SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS TO SUPPORT FOOD FOR ALL AND ALSO TO FUND ARE INDISPENSABLE FOOD BANKS AND PROVIDE DISASTER RESILIENCY IN THE FUTURE. WE PROVIDE A SUBSTANTIAL GRANT INCREASE TO SS I SS P. RECIPIENTS AND WE FOUND A MULTITUDE OF SUPPORTS IN OUR CHILD WELFARE AND FOSTER CARE SYSTEM. OTHER NOTABLE INVESTMENTS IN OUR HUMAN SERVICES PROGRAM INCLUDE EXPANDING THE ADULT PROTECTIVE SERVICES. INCREASING CAPACITY IN INFRASTRUCTURE AND OUR SENIOR NUTRITION PROGRAMS BROADENING LAND FROM AN EARLY START TWO THREE AND FIVE YEAR OLDS AND SUPPORTING THE CALIFORNIA REDUCING DISPARITIES PROJECT. I WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE EXTRA ORDINARY WORK DONE BY THE ADMINISTRATION TO ADDRESS THE USE BEHAVIORAL HEALTH. EARLY IN THE PANDEMIC MANY OF US RECOGNIZE THE LIKELIHOOD THAT A BEHAVIORAL HEALTH CRISIS WOULD BE THE TSUNAMI THAT RESULTS FROM PROVIDES EARTHQUAKE. TRAGICALLY DATA BEARS OUT. BEARS THAT OUT SHE SICK. RISING RATES OF MENTAL ILLNESS AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE ESPECIALLY AMONG OUR CHILDREN. IT IS LONG BEEN UNDERSTOOD THAT SOCIAL DETERMINANTS OF HEALTH HEALTH INEQUITIES AND UNDER FUNDED PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE ARE KEY FACTORS AFFECTING THE HEALTH OF ALL CALIFORNIANS. WE PROVIDE A TWO HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR AUGMENTATION TO LOCAL HEALTH JURISDICTIONS TO MEET THE CORE PUBLIC HEALTH INFRASTRUCTURE NEEDS. AN INVESTMENT THAT ISN'T ACCOMPANIED BY RESOURCES TO FUND AN ANALYSIS OF LOCAL PUBLIC HEALTH STAFFING AND OTHER NEEDS IN ORDER TO INFORM FUTURE FUNDING DECISIONS. WE MUST ESTABLISH A ROBUST AND EQUITABLE SYSTEM THAT WORKS FOR ALL. THE CALIFORNIA ADVANCING AND INNOVATING MEDIKAL CAL AIM PROPOSAL WILL DO THAT BY STREAMLINING TRANSFORMING AND FOUNDATIONAL CHANGING MEDICAL DELIVERY SERVICE AND FINANCING. I LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING CONVERSATIONS AND APPRECIATE. THE ONGOING DISCUSSIONS TAKING PLACE. THE PANDEMIC HAS FURTHER EXACERBATED RACIAL AND ETHNIC HEALTH DISPARITIES AND MADE IT CLEAR THAT ACCESS TO COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE IS NECESSARY FOR EVERY RESIDENT IN OUR STATE. I AM THRILLED THAT THIS BUDGET FURTHER OF ROADS THE IMMORAL EXCLUSION OF MANY TAXPAYERS AND THEIR FAMILIES FOR MEDICAL COVERAGE BY EXPANDING FULL SCOPE MEDICAL. TO ALL INCOME ELIGIBLE IMMIGRANTS OVER THE AGE OF FIFTY. THE HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES INVESTMENTS IN OUR PLAN REFLECT NOT ONLY THE CARE THE SUPPORT AND SERVICES THAT PEOPLE NEED TODAY. BUT THE CALIFORNIA THAT WE WANT FOR ALL OF OUR CHILDREN AND FAMILIES IN A POST PANDEMIC FUTURE THAT IS BEAMING WITH OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL FUELED BY EQUITY. I WANT TO THANK THE GOVERNOR THE ADMINISTRATION THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THE LEGISLATIVE ANALYST'S OFFICE. THE COUNTIES THE ADVOCATES ON THE PUBLIC THANK YOU MEMBERS AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU DR ARAMBULA MEMBERS IF YOU'D LIKE TO PURCHASE. IN PLEASE RAISE YOUR MICROPHONE. AT THIS TIME. MISS REAVIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER MEMBERS I'D STAND TODAY TO SPEAK ABOUT THE INVESTMENTS BEING MADE IN THIS BUDGET BILL TO ADDRESS HOMELESSNESS FIRST I HAVE TO THANK OUR BUDGET CHAIR ARE BUDGET SUB FOR CHAIR AND OF COURSE OUR SPEAKER FOR RISING UP TO MEET THIS MOMENT WE'VE HEARD FROM THIS ADMINISTRATION THAT THERE IS A DESIRE TO COMBAT HOMELESSNESS WELL THIS BUDGET PROVIDES AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO PUT OUR MONEY WHERE OUR MOUTH IS. AS MANY OF YOU KNOW SEVERAL OF US IN THIS HOUSE HAVE WORKED ON HOMELESSNESS INCLUDING MY SEATMATE FROM FULLER TEN AND MYSELF FOR THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS BOB THIS YEAR I HAD A BILL THAT WOULD HAVE GENERATED ON GOING FUNDING FOR HOMELESSNESS FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER BUT BECAUSE OF THE WORK IN THIS BUDGET- I'M RISING TODAY TO SAY I ENCOURAGE YOU TO SUPPORT THIS MEASURE. HOMELESSNESS ISN'T AN URBAN OR RURAL ISSUE IT'S A CALIFORNIA ISSUE OUR CONSTITUENTS WANT TO KNOW THAT THIS ISSUE IS BEING TAKEN SERIOUSLY AND FOR SEVERAL YEARS THIS LEGISLATURE HAS SHOWN THAT IT'S WILLING TO DO WHAT IS NEEDED TO MOVE CALIFORNIA FORWARD IN REDUCING OUR HOMELESS POPULATION. I HOPE THAT THE ADMINISTRATION WILL SUPPORT THESE INVESTMENTS AND THE ADDITIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY MEASURES THAT WILL BE FOLLOWING SHORTLY IN OUR TRAILER BILLS THANK YOU AND I URGE YOU TO SUPPORT AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT. THANK MYSTERY OF US. DR CHOI. YOU RECORD. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER AND MEMBERS- TODAY I RISE TO IN OPPOSITION TO ASSEMBLY BID A LOT ONE TWENTY EIGHT THE BUDGET BILL OUGHT BEFORE US ARE TODAY TO NO MORE THAN OUR TWO HUNDRED SPACES HAVE BILLION. ACCORDING TO THE PROVIDE SO ON A FEW AREAS ARE- THE I ALSO PULL THOUGH SO IT'S AS SO OUR SYSTEM- FOR VETERAN SO. AND- ON- SOME THE HEALTH. WON'T WORK FOR- HOWEVER I AM DEEPLY- THE DOT THAT THE BUDGET BILL NOT THE ALL WERE SO MANY THE FROM FUNDING FOR X. LOAN TIME. THIS INCLUDE A THREE POINT. BILLION A GROWING FIVE BILLION DOLLAR ANNUALLY TO A SOME ACT. SO ALZADO LOCAL BASIS. NINE BASED OFF SCHOOL ARE ARE GROUP. AND THE- BUT THE NEW THE FUNDING LIMIT FUNDING TO SPEED STUDENTS INC SO. I WAS SO FOR MORE OPPORTUNITIES SO FOR PARENTS AND STUDENTS WHO DESIRE HEIAU. HI ARE ALL QUALITY OF EDUCATION WITH THE LOSS LIMITATION ZAPATO SHOULD BE SUPPORTED OR NOT EQUAL FUNDING BASIS- THE BUDGET ALSO ALL PROMISE OF FOUR BILLION DOLLARS SO OF A FUTURE PROP NINETY EIGHT THE GENERAL GROWTH. BUT THE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE LANGUAGE IN THE TRAILER BILLS IT IS EXPECTED TO LIMIT THE RESOURCES SO THE LOCAL EDUCATION AGENCIES ARE BASED ON ON ON UNDUPLICATED CHILDREN AND ROMAN THOUGHT INGRESA. TU K. THROUGH SIX. SO SCHOOLS. YOU HAD AGAIN NOT WILL BE EXCLUDED A FROM THE ADDITIONAL FUNDING SOURCES SO FROM PROP NINETY EIGHT. JANVIER UNFAIRNESS ALL OF THIS BUDGET WAS SO TOTAL SCORES. THIS BUDGET THE CONTINUOUS THE GROWTH OF A GOVERNMENTAL WIDER FAILING TO ADDRESS OUR AUDIBLE CONTROLLER COST OF LIVING TO PREPARE OURSELVES FOR SUCCESS AS WE MOVE OUT OF THIS SO CALLED IT UP AND THEN MAKE A- AGAIN. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE MANY SELECT THE ELEMENTS ARE AND AS WE HEARD THE IN THIS BUDGET THAT THOUGHT I. OUR SUPPORT AND OUR- GOOD THE DIRECTION THAT THOUGH- WE ARE HEADING BUT THERE'S GE NO VOTE ON THIS OF BUDGET- SO HOLDER BEFORE US TODAY THANK YOU. TECDAX CHOI IS WALDRON. YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE IN OPPOSITION TO AB ONE TWENTY EIGHT WHILE THIS BUDGET INCLUDES MANY VERY SUPPORTABLE AND MANY MUCH NEEDED PROGRAMS- AND FUNDING. IT ALSO DRAMATICALLY EXPANDS THE SCOPE OF GOVERNMENT WITH NEW PROGRAMS THAT WILL NOT BE SUSTAINABLE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. LAWMAKERS WILL BE LOOKING TO EITHER CUT PROGRAMS THAT JUST STARTED OR RAISE TAXES NEITHER OF WHICH WOULD BE GOOD GOVERNANCE INSTEAD OF FIXING THE BROKEN PARTS OF GOVERNMENT WE'RE SIMPLY EXPANDING IT. WE ALL KNOW THIS JUST LOOK AT THE WORK BUT THIS FUNCTIONAL EDT IS CAUSING OUR OFFICES. IT'S EXHIBIT A OF HOW BROKEN GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CAN BE. LET'S GET BACK TO BASICS AND FIX WHAT'S BROKEN BEFORE WE SPEND MORE. THIS BUDGET ALSO DOES NOT REVERSE NEARLY NINE POINT TWO BILLION IN TAX INCREASES IMPOSED LAST YEAR. MAKING CALIFORNIA UNAFFORDABLE TO SO MANY. WE SHOULD BE FOCUSED ON PREPARING FOR POSSIBLE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IF IN THE FUTURE WE SHOULD PAY BACK THE SEVEN POINT EIGHT BILLION TAKEN FROM THE RAINY DAY FUND IN ORDER TO MAKE OUR STATE MORE RESILIENT I CANNOT SUPPORT THIS BUDGET TODAY AND I URGE A NO VOTE. MISTER CARE YOUR RECORD. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS I RISE TODAY TO JUST DISCUSS TO SIMPLE THINGS I THINK A YEAR AGO WE HAD A COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE IN THE BUDGET WHEN WE WERE FACING DIRE CUTS AND MANY OF THE MEMBERS OF THE WOMEN'S CAUCUS MYSELF INCLUDED STOOD UP AND ASKED FOR US TO PASS A FEMINIST BUDGET WE TALKED ABOUT WHAT IT MEANT TO TAKE CARE OF CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE PEOPLE OUR CHILDREN ARE ELDERLY. THOSE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES AND I THINK IT'S MY COLLEAGUES WHO SAID THIS BUDGET IS A LOT OF THOSE THINGS AND IN INCREDIBLE WAYS IT MOVES THE BALL FORWARD ON TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN FOR ALL CHILDREN IT STEPS UP FOR THOSE LIVING WITH DISABILITIES IT FOCUSES ON SOLVING OUR HOMELESSNESS CRISIS I THINK ALL OF THAT IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT. BUT THERE ARE TWO THINGS THAT I URGE US TO PAY ATTENTION TO MOVING FORWARD ONE IS ACCOUNTABILITY TIME AND AGAIN WE SEE FROM OUR INCREDIBLE STATE AUDITOR THAT OUR DOLLARS ARE GOING BACK TO THE COUNTIES AND WE ARE GETTING THE RESULTS THAT WE EXPECT INTO IS WE CONTINUE TO FUND THESE PROGRAMS WE MUST BE HOLDING THOSE PEOPLE WHO GET THOSE DOLLARS ACCOUNTABLE TO ENSURE WE'RE SEEING. THINGS IMPROVE FOR ALL CALIFORNIANS. SECONDLY I HAVE TO AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE. WHO SPOKE JUST BEFORE ME ABOUT RESERVES. YOU KNOW AS ONE OF THE MEMBERS WHO'S BEEN HERE THE SHORTEST TENURE AND MAYBE HERE. MANY MORE YEARS THAN THOSE OF YOU THAT TURNED OUT IN JUST A FEW YEARS. I MAY BE HERE. WHEN THE RECESSION HIT. WE MAY ALL BE HERE WHEN A RECESSION HITS. AND IT IS INCUMBENT UPON US TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE SAVED FOR THAT RAINY DAY. AND ALTHOUGH I COMMEND THIS BODY AND THE SENATE FOR GOING FURTHER THAN MANY THE ADMINISTRATION AND THAT WE DO NOT GO FAR ENOUGH. WE NEED TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE REPLENISHING OUR RAINY DAY FUND. THAT WE ARE PAYING BACK. THE BORROWING WE DID LAST YEAR WHEN WE HAD TO MAKE EXTENSIVE CUTS. AND WE NEED TO BE FOR. FOR PASSING A RESPONSIBLE BUDGET THAT ENSURES THAT FUTURE BODIES HAVE THOSE RAINY DAY RESERVES WHEN THEY NEED IT THANK YOU MEMBERS. THANK YOU MISTER A HAVE. THIS PETRIE-NORRIS YOU ARE RECOGNIZED. THANK YOU MR SPEAKER AND MEMBERS. I JUST TWELVE MONTHS AGO WE STOOD HERE ON THIS FLOOR CONFRONTING A HISTORIC BUDGET DEFICIT. FAST FORWARD TWELVE MONTHS AND TODAY WE ARE IN A MUCH DIFFERENT POSITION A REMARKABLY DIFFERENT POSITION WE HAVE A HISTORIC BUDGET SURPLUS. AND THIS SURPLUS GIVES US AN INCREDIBLE OPPORTUNITY TO FORGE A JAST SWIFT AND ROBUST RECOVERY FOR CALIFORNIA WE SHOULD BE THINKING BOWL. WE SHOULD BE THINKING BIG AND THERE ARE SO MANY EXCITING PROGRAMS THAT ARE PART OF THIS BUDGET. HOWEVER WE'VE ALSO GOT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE GETTING THE FUNDAMENTALS RIGHT THAT WE ARE AS AS MY COLLEAGUE JUST SAID SAVING FOR A RAINY DAY THAT WE ARE INSURING BUDGET RESILIENCE SO THAT WHEN THE INEVITABLE WHEN THE INEVITABLE CYCLICAL DOWNTURN TIMES WE DO NOT FIND OURSELVES IN A POSITION OF HAVING. TO CUT PROGRAMS AND CUT SERVICES FOR THE CALIFORNIANS WHO WE REPRESENT AND WHO WE WHO WE FIGHT FOR EACH AND EVERY DAY AND SO I WOULD ADD MY VOICE TO THOSE. URGING URGING US TO GO FURTHER STILL IN INCREASING OUR RESERVES AND ENSURING THAT WE ARE PAYING BACK THE FULL TWELVE BILLION DOLLARS IN AD BUDGET SOLUTIONS THAT SAYS THAT WE IMPLEMENTED LAST YEAR I AM GRATEFUL TO THE BUDGET CHAIR AND BUDGET COMMITTEE THAT THIS BUDGETS- PROPOSAL DOES GO FURTHER THAN THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSAL- WOULD LIKE TO YOU ACT CONTINUES CONVERSATION AS WE MOVE THROUGH THE PROCESS OF. RECENT BUDGET TRAILER BILLS AND BUDGET BILL JUNIORS SO THAT WE CAN ENSURE THAT WE'RE BUILDING A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR CALIFORNIA THAT WE'RE BUILDING A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR THIS RECOVERY AND THAT WE CAN BUILD BACK CALIFORNIA. BETTER THAN BEFORE THANK YOU. THANK YOU WITH PIZZA NORRIS. MR MCCARTY YOU ARE RECOGNIZED THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER I RISE IN STRONG SUPPORT OF THIS TRANSFORMATIONAL BUDGET ESPECIALLY RELATE TO OUR SCHOOLS AND OUR KIDS BUT BEFORE THAT I JUST WANT TO TOUCH ON THIS ISSUE WITH THE RESERVE. AND OUR BUDGET CHAIR NOTED IT BUT I'LL JUST HIGHLIGHTED AGAIN WAS HOW THEY JUST BY A FEW SPEAKERS BUT- MORE- MORE DIRECTLY BY OUR VICE CHAIR OF THE BUDGET FROM FRESNO SENSUALLY SAYS THAT WE'RE BEING IRRESPONSIBLE AND NOT SAVING FOR THE RAINY DAY WHAT JUST THAT'S A SPOT FALSE NOT TRUE OUR RESERVE IN THIS BUDGET IS NORTH OF TWENTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS WE RESTORE THE RESERVE WHERE IT WAS. IT'S AT HISTORIC HIGH I RESERVE IN THREE YEARS WHICH FROM PLANNING FOR IT WILL BE THIRTY FIVE BILLION DOLLARS TEN MORE BILLION THAN HISTORIC HIGH SO THIS BUDGET SHOWS. IS THAT WE CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME WE CAN FOCUS ON BEING RESPONSIBLE BUT INVEST IN THE FUTURE BECAUSE LET'S FACE IT WE HAVE AN UNBELIEVABLE GROWTH AND REVENUES FROM THE WEALTHIEST CALIFORNIANS. AND SO WHAT CAN WE DO WITH THAT INVEST INVEST IN THE REST OF CALIFORNIANS TO MAKE SURE WE CAN ALL CATCH UP. AND WE HAVE ONE TIME MONEY FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THAT WE ARE SPENDING ON ONE TIME THINGS. AND AGAIN THAT THE USE OF THE TERM TRANSFORMATIONAL IS PROBABLY SOMETIMES OVERSTATED BUT IN THIS INSTANCE. I WILL SAY IT'S NOT THIS BUDGET WILL CHANGE LIVES IT WILL CHANGE THE TRAJECTORY. FOR SO MANY KIDS IN CALIFORNIA THIS CLEARLY IS THE BEST BUDGET THAT I VOTED ON IN SEVEN YEARS. THE BEST EDUCATION BUDGET BUT THEY THIS MAY BE THE BEST EDUCATION BUDGET IN ANY YEAR. AND I GUARANTEE ALL OF YOU WHEN YOU RAN FOR OFFICE TALKED ABOUT ARE YOU OUR KIDS OUR SCHOOLS. OUR COLLEGES REGARDLESS OF YOUR POLITICAL AFFILIATION WHEREVER YOU'RE FROM. WELL THIS IS THIS IS THE DAY TO CAST THE MOST CONSEQUENTIAL VOTE. ON OUR KIDS ON OUR P. THREE SIXTEEN SCHOOL SYSTEM. THIS IS THE DAY FOR CALIFORNIANS AND FUTURE GENERATIONS. OTHER BUDGETARY LAID IT OUT THIS IMPACTS THE LIVES FOR MANY KIDS IN CALIFORNIANS I'M GONNA FOCUS ON THE NUMBERS. BUT WHAT THIS WILL MEAN TO PEOPLE THE FAMILIES. FOR OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS FROM EARLY EDUCATION THE AMOUNT OF MONEY WE'RE PUTTING FORWARD. IS UNFATHOMABLE TO BE LOOK AT SOMETIMES NORTH OF FIVE BILLION DOLLARS IN NEW MONEY. SO WHAT THIS MEANS IF YOU'RE A FAMILY ON A WAITING LIST. TRYING TO GET CHILD CARE THE LIST WE CUT IN HALF. FROM FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BY US INCREASING. ANOTHER TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND CHILD CARE SLOTS. FOR RATES FOR PROVIDERS WHO ARE BARELY HANGING ON THE SO MAKE SURE THAT YOUR PROGRAMS ARE FINANCIALLY VIABLE. BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY THIS ALLOW YOUR- WORKERS TO NOT BE PAID POVERTY WAGES SO THEY CAN STICK AROUND AND FOCUS ON OUR YOUNGEST LEARNERS AND NOT MOVE ON TO GO WORK. AT SOME OTHER LOW WAGE JOB BECAUSE WE SHOULD VALUE. ARE WORKERS IN THIS FIELD. WE'RE GOING TO ELIMINATE FAMILY FEES TO MAKE SURE THAT FAMILIES CAN REALLY AFFORD. THESE PROGRAMS. AND WE ARE GOING TO MAKE SURE WE HAD UNIVERSAL TRANSITIONAL KINDERGARTEN ONCE AND FOR ALL FOR ALL FOUR YEAR OLDS TO MAKE SURE THE MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES. DON'T HAVE TO PAY THE THOUSAND A TWO THOUSAND DOLLARS A MONTH FOR PRE K. 25% OF KIDS IN CALIFORNIA GETTY K. OTHER THREE QUARTERS DON'T. THAT'S FUNDAMENTALLY UNFAIR WE'RE CHANGING THAT ONCE AND FOR ALL. FOR OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS. THE PER PUPIL FUNDING IN THIS BUDGET FOR OUR SCHOOLS. IS OVER TWENTY ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER STUDENT WHAT DOES THAT MEAN THREE YEARS AGO WE WERE AT TWELVE THOUSAND. SO THIS MEANS THAT SCHOOLS CAN BRING BACK IN RICHMOND PROGRAMS PAY THEIR TEACHERS LIVING WAGES AS WELL MAKE SURE THAT WE DON'T CUT THE BASICS IN OUR CLASSROOMS REDUCE CLASS SIZES FOR TWO FOR OUR EARLIEST GRADES WHICH THE BUFFET GOVERNOR PROVIDES ITS WE EMBRACE. WE'RE GOING TO DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF KIDS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS IF YOUR FAMILY WANTS TO HAVE A PLACE FOR YOUR KID TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL SAFE. WE'RE GONNA DOUBLE THE AMOUNT OF SLOTS IN AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND NOT IT IS WELL IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS IS GOING TO BE UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR ALL KIDS AFTER SCHOOL. SO WE SHOULD BE WAITING LESS FOR THOSE AS WELL. FIRST OUR SCHOOL MEALS PROGRAMS THAT ARE. OUR COLLEAGUE FROM THAT SAN FERNANDO VALLEY'S BEEN PUSHING FOR YEARS WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT'S UNIVERSALLY ACCESSIBLE FOR SCHOOL MEALS SO KIDS DON'T HAVE TO SCRAMBLED ON THEIR- DOWN THEIR DEBT OWED AND BE SEEN BY THEIR SCHOOL DEBT FEES. FOR FOOD WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT THAT SCHOOL MEALS ARE THE NORM. FOR OUR COLLEGES UNIVERSITIES FOR OUR FUTURE. THIS IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO OUR ECONOMY TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE GRADUATES TO FILL THE JOBS OF TODAY AND TOMORROW. WE'RE FULLY FUNDING OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES GIVING THEM A SUPER CALL I'M- PROMOTING PROGRAMS LIKE A MOSHE. ARISING SCHOLARS WEDNESDAY IN MESA TO HELP THE NEXT GENERATION OF STUDENTS GET INTER COMMUNICABLE TO HAVE A PIPELINE TO SUCCESS. FOR HIGHER EDUCATION. FOR CSU. OVER NINE THOUSAND MORE FAMILIES WHO GET A REJECTION NOTICE EVERY YEAR BECAUSE ANA SLOTS IN THE CSU. WILL HAVE A SPOT. FOR YOU SEE. OVER SIX THOUSAND FOR OUR FOR OUR COVETED COLLEGES AT BERKELEY. SAN DIEGO UCLA. WITH FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS. HAVE HAD ROUGHLY ONE IN THREE SLOTS FOR EVERY. FOR EVERY NON RESIDENTS TE WORKING CALIFORNIAN WE'RE GOING TO LOWER THAT NUMBER AND ABOUT FIVE THOUSAND ADDITIONAL HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES WILL BE ABLE TO GO TO THE UNIVERSITY OF IT A CALIFORNIA AND THOSE THREE CAMPUSES PLUS OVERALL AND THE OTHER SIX UC UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES. BIRD FINANCIAL AID WE LITERALLY HAVE A PLAN HERE TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE IN CALIFORNIA IF YOU LOOK AT FAMILY'S FINANCIAL CONTRIBUTIONS EXISTING FINANCIAL AID WORKING FIFTEEN HOURS A WEEK WE HAVE A PLAN HERE IN A PATH TO MAKE COLLEGE DEBT FREE FOR THOSE FAMILIES. AS WELL AS MAKING CUT COMMUNITY COLLEGE THE CAL GRANT PROGRAMS WORK FOR THEM AND NOT EXCLUDE THEM SO IT'S SON THIS IS A BUDGET THAT WE ALL TALKED ABOUT FOR DECADES. THE MAKING SURE THAT WE CHANGE THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SO IT'S NOT FOR THE FEW BUT FOR THE MANY AND THIS IS SOMETHING WE SHOULD ALL BE PROUD WITH I'M CERTAINLY- PLEASE WIRE LEADERSHIP SPEAKER- LET US IN THIS IN THIS QUEST AS WELL AS OUR BUDGET SHARE AND I ASK FOR A STRONG I DON'T THINK YOU. THANK YOU MEASURE ACCORDING THANK YOU MEMBERS SEE NO OTHER MEMBERS SEEKING RECOGNITION. MISTER TANK YOU MAY CLOSE. THANK YOU MISTER SPEAKER. I HAVE THE HONOR WAS SO MANY OTHERS IN THIS ROOM OF BEING IN THE CLASS OF TWENTY TWELVE. THEN I KNOW THE. THE FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT. IT'S A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHEN WE TOOK OFFICE. WE WERE COMING IN OFF THE HEELS OF A GREAT RECESSION. WE COSTLY WHO HERE FROM THE CLASSES AHEAD OF US. HAVE HAD TO SLEEP HERE ALL NIGHT HOW TO HOW TO MAKE DEVASTATING CUTS TO OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET TO HEALTH CARE TO DDT CAL FRESH CAL WORKS EVERY SINGLE PROGRAM. THE PEOPLE RELY ON. IN THEIR DAILY LIVES JUST TO GET THROUGH. EVERY DAY. AND WHILE WE COULD BE SAVING MORE WE STARTED THAT PARTICULAR YEAR WITH RESERVE. ZERO THE PREVIOUS SPEAKER SAID THIS BUDGET WAS GREAT BECAUSE WE'RE BROKE WE'RE NO LONGER DEFICIT WE ARE JUST BROKE. AND WE WERE THE ONES OUR CLASS WAS THE ONES WE PUT THE RAINY DAY. FUND ON THE BALLOT. WE HAD THIS AWKWARD BILLION DOLLAR AFTER BILLION DOLLAR AFTER BILLION DOLLAR AND THIS IS ALL THE SAME TIME WHEN WE WOULD HEAR FROM ALL THOSE CONSTITUENCIES. BETTER STILL RAINING OUTSIDE YOUR IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE PUTTING MONEY INTO THIS RAINY DAY FUND BUT YOU KNOW. FOR THE DD FAMILIES IT'S STILL RAINING. FOR FAMILIES THAT DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE YOU KNOW WHAT IT'S STILL RAINING. FOR FAMILIES I COULDN'T GET THE CHILD CARE. GUESS WHAT. THEY NEED HELP RIGHT NOW. FULL LIKE EVERY BUDGET. WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT WE ARE DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FISCALLY IN BEING COMPLETELY FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE. WE ALSO HAVE TO REMEMBER GOVERNMENT'S PRIMARY JOB WHICH IS TO HELP THOSE MOST IN NEED. THIS YEAR WHILE THE STATE HAS A BUDGET SURPLUS WE'VE ALL HAD A PRETTY AWFUL YEAR. OUR COMMUNITIES HAVE HAD A VERY VERY TOUGH YEAR. SO THIS BUDGET RECOGNIZES ALL THE HELP THAT EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE COMMUNITIES AND OUR FAMILIES NEED AT THIS TIME. IT'S HELP FOR THE BUSINESSES THAT HAVE STRUGGLED TO STAY OPEN DURING THIS PANDEMIC. IT'S HELP FOR THE FAMILIES THAT HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO GO BACK TO WORK BECAUSE THEY DON'T HAVE CHILD CARE. IT'S HELP. FOR FAMILIES WHO ARE HOMELESS AND HOUSED AND FED. BEFORE THIS PANDEMIC MADE IT EVEN WORSE. SO OUR JOB AS A BODY IS TO DELIBERATE INTIMATE. A DECISION THAT I REALLY DO APPRECIATE THIS ROBUST DELIBERATION THE IDEAS THAT WE HAVE TALKED ABOUT THAT IS REALLY OUR JOB AS THE LEGISLATURE TO REPRESENT ALL THE DIFFERENT. POINTS OF USE. BUT LET ME TELL YOU WHEN YOU GO HOME. AND YOU EACH ONE OF YOU TO GO HOME TO YOUR COMMUNITY TO TALK ABOUT THIS BUDGET. THERE IS A LOT TO BE PROUD OF THERE'S A LOT TO TALK ABOUT YOU WILL BE DOING.
