00:45:54.351 --> 00:45:56.420
IT'S BEEN A GREAT PARTNERSHIP.

00:45:56.487 --> 00:45:57.254
WE'VE LEARNED FROM OUR PAST

00:45:57.321 --> 00:45:59.089
MISTAKES.

00:45:59.156 --> 00:46:01.191
AND JUST AS MANY OF US ARE THAT

00:46:01.258 --> 00:46:02.526
SERVED.

00:46:02.593 --> 00:46:03.994

OR THE BLAME.

00:46:17.708 --> 00:46:19.476
BUT LAWMAKERS SHARE THE ULTIMATE

00:46:19.543 --> 00:46:21.378
RESPONSIBILITY.

00:46:21.445 --> 00:46:23.013

WE MAY BE PREPARED TO AND DURING

00:46:33.624 --> 00:46:35.792
THE FIGURATIVE RAINY DAYS.

00:46:35.859 --> 00:46:37.861
BUT WE HAVE MUCH WORK TO DO TO

00:46:37.928 --> 00:46:39.396
PROTECT OUR STATE.

00:46:39.463 --> 00:46:40.864
AND OUR COMMUNITIES FROM THE

00:46:40.931 --> 00:46:44.101
VERY REAL RAVAGES OF NATURE.

00:46:44.168 --> 00:46:45.435
ALREADY THIS DECADE WE'VE

00:46:45.502 --> 00:46:46.803
ENTERED FIVE YEARS OF HISTORIC

00:46:46.870 --> 00:46:48.572

00:46:52.643 --> 00:46:54.344
DESTRUCTIVE WILDFIRES IN OUR

HISTORY INCLUDING THE CAMPFIRE

00:46:56.246 --> 00:46:58.482

EMBERS HAVE BEEN PUT OUT.

00:47:03.187 --> 00:47:04.588
AS WE SAW WITH THE DEVASTATING

00:49:04.141 --> 00:49:06.109
WE CAN AFFORD TO IGNORE THE

EXTRAORDINARY FINANCIAL COST

00:49:08.078 --> 00:49:10.414

COMMUNITIES AND ARE VERY ECONOMY.

00:49:53.023 --> 00:49:55.392
WE'RE IN UNCHARTED TERRITORY.

00:49:55.459 --> 00:49:56.860
AND ALL SIGNS INDICATE WE'VE

00:49:56.927 --> 00:49:58.128
ONLY JUST BEGUN TO FEEL THE

00:49:58.195 --> 00:50:00.063
HARSH NEW REALITIES OF A WARMING

00:50:00.130 --> 00:50:01.565
PLANET.

00:50:01.631 --> 00:50:03.166
WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT THE

00:50:03.233 --> 00:50:05.369
IMPACTS REACH ACROSS EVERY FACET

00:50:05.435 --> 00:50:07.037

TO HOUSING EDUCATION AND OUR

00:50:09.072 --> 00:50:10.941
INFRASTRUCTURE.

00:50:11.007 --> 00:50:12.542
THE PEOPLE OF CALIFORNIA ARE

00:50:12.609 --> 00:50:13.910
RESILIENT.

00:50:13.977 --> 00:50:15.846
AND NOW WE NEED TO INSURE THAT

00:50:15.912 --> 00:50:18.014
ARE BUILT ENVIRONMENTS ARE AS

00:50:18.081 --> 00:50:18.982
WELL.

00:50:19.049 --> 00:50:20.851
THAT'S OUR NEXT CHALLENGE.

00:50:20.917 --> 00:50:22.252
WE TOOK IMPORTANT STEPS THIS

00:50:22.319 --> 00:50:23.787
YEAR TO ADAPT INCLUDING

00:50:23.854 --> 00:50:25.522
REVAMPING OUR EMERGENCY RESPONSE

00:50:25.589 --> 00:50:26.890
PROTOCOLS.

00:50:26.957 --> 00:50:28.225
AND WE BECAME THE FIRST MAJOR

00:50:28.291 --> 00:50:30.794
ECONOMY ON EARTH TO COMMIT TO A

00:50:30.861 --> 00:50:35.532
100% CLEAN ENERGY BY.

00:50:35.599 --> 00:50:36.166
TWENTY FORTY FIVE BUT WE HAVE A

00:50:36.233 --> 00:50:37.634
LONG WAY TO GO IN A SHORT AMOUNT

00:50:37.701 --> 00:50:39.703
OF TIME IF WE WANT TO AVOID EVEN

00:50:39.770 --> 00:50:40.771
WORSE DAYS.

00:50:40.837 --> 00:50:43.607
AHEAD FOR OUR COMMUNITIES.

00:50:43.673 --> 00:50:44.908
SO WE HAVE QUITE A BIT OF WORK

00:50:44.975 --> 00:50:48.111
STILL TO DO. TO GET OUR OWN

00:50:48.178 --> 00:50:50.280
HOUSE IN ORDER AS WELL.

00:50:50.347 --> 00:50:51.348
WE HAVE BIG CHALLENGES BIG

00:50:51.415 --> 00:50:53.083
ISSUES.

00:50:53.150 --> 00:50:55.419
WE ALSO HAVE INTERNAL ISSUES

00:50:55.485 --> 00:50:56.386
THAT WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO WORK

00:50:56.453 --> 00:50:57.988
ON I SAID WHEN I TOOK THIS

00:50:58.054 --> 00:50:59.356
OFFICE THAT MY MANDATE WOULD BE

00:50:59.423 --> 00:51:00.557
TO RAISE THE STANDARDS OF

00:51:00.624 --> 00:51:01.625
CONDUCT.

00:51:01.691 --> 00:51:04.528
AND PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY IN

00:51:04.594 --> 00:51:05.862
THE SENATE AN IN THIS CAPITAL.

00:51:05.929 --> 00:51:07.230
I MEANT IT THEN AND I MEAN IT

00:51:07.297 --> 00:51:09.032
NOW.

00:51:09.099 --> 00:51:10.100
WE'VE TAKEN STEPS THROUGH OUR

00:51:10.167 --> 00:51:11.134
JOINT RULES COMMITTEE TO

00:51:11.201 --> 00:51:13.503
IMPLEMENT CONFIDENTIAL REPORTING.

00:51:13.570 --> 00:51:15.038
SYSTEM AND AN INDEPENDENT

00:51:15.105 --> 00:51:16.540
INVESTIGATIVE PROCESS TO BOTH

00:51:16.606 --> 00:51:18.241
PROTECT VICTIMS.

00:51:18.308 --> 00:51:20.710
OF SEXUAL MISCONDUCT AND ENSURE

00:51:20.777 --> 00:51:22.512
JUSTICE IS SERVED.

00:51:22.579 --> 00:51:24.247
BUT WE CAN'T BE SATISFIED WITH

00:51:24.314 --> 00:51:25.549
OUR PROGRESS BECAUSE THESE STEPS

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.818
ALONE WON'T CHANGE THE CULTURE.

00:51:27.884 --> 00:51:29.686
OF THIS BUILDING.

00:51:29.753 --> 00:51:32.022
ONLY WE CAN DO THAT.

00:51:32.088 --> 00:51:33.356
AND THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT THIS

00:51:33.423 --> 00:51:34.791
WORK WILL NEVER BE FINISHED

00:51:34.858 --> 00:51:35.959
BECAUSE THERE IS NO FINAL

00:51:36.026 --> 00:51:39.362
DESTINATION.

00:51:39.429 --> 00:51:40.597
CALIFORNIA.

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.599
IN SO MANY WAYS WE ARE A STUDY

00:51:42.666 --> 00:51:45.168
IN PROGRESS BUT WE'RE ALSO A

00:51:45.235 --> 00:51:47.437
WORK IN PROGRESS WE CAN'T AFFORD

00:51:47.504 --> 00:51:49.673
COMPLACENCY WE STILL HAVE SO

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.575
MUCH WORK TO DO.

00:51:51.641 --> 00:51:53.810
BECAUSE THE GULF BETWEEN HAVES

00:51:53.877 --> 00:51:55.879
AND HAVE NOTS IN THE STATE IS AS

00:51:55.946 --> 00:51:57.714
WIDE AS OUR LEGENDARY CENTRAL

00:51:57.781 --> 00:51:59.249
VALLEY IS VAST.

00:51:59.316 --> 00:52:01.251
AND IT'S ONLY GROWING.

00:52:01.318 --> 00:52:03.286
HOUSING PRICES HAVE SOARED OUT

00:52:03.353 --> 00:52:04.754
OF REACH FOR WORKING FAMILIES

00:52:04.821 --> 00:52:06.990
AND DESPITE OUR RECENT EFFORTS

00:52:07.057 --> 00:52:08.859
WERE NOT BUILDING NEARLY ENOUGH

00:52:08.925 --> 00:52:11.795
TO MEET THAT DEMAND.

00:52:11.862 --> 00:52:12.629
IN A STATE KNOWN FOR

00:52:12.696 --> 00:52:14.231
ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION OVER A

00:52:14.297 --> 00:52:15.999
MILLION RESIDENTS STILL DON'T

00:52:16.066 --> 00:52:17.801
HAVE RELIABLE CLEAN DRINKING

00:52:17.868 --> 00:52:20.237
WATER.

00:52:20.303 --> 00:52:21.705
AND MILLIONS MORE BRIEF THE MOST

00:52:21.771 --> 00:52:24.241
POLLUTED AIR IN OUR NATION.

00:52:24.307 --> 00:52:26.343
THESE CONTRAST THE FINE ARTS

00:52:26.409 --> 00:52:27.911
CHALLENGE.

00:52:27.978 --> 00:52:30.080
AS LAWMAKERS WE MUST HELP TO

00:52:30.146 --> 00:52:31.848
HARNESS CALIFORNIA'S EXTRA

00:52:31.915 --> 00:52:34.050
ORDINARY BOUNTIES IN ORDER TO

00:52:34.117 --> 00:52:36.453
MEET OUR MANY URGENT NEEDS.

00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:38.755
WE MUST ALIGN OUR ACTIONS WITH

00:52:38.822 --> 00:52:40.423
OUR VALUES.

00:52:40.490 --> 00:52:41.825
IF WE DON'T ACKNOWLEDGE THESE

00:52:41.892 --> 00:52:43.293
CHALLENGES WE WILL NEVER

00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.762
OVERCOME THEM.

00:52:45.829 --> 00:52:47.964
SO I CHALLENGE EACH OF YOU TO

00:52:48.031 --> 00:52:49.466
SEARCH WITHIN YOURSELVES.

00:52:49.533 --> 00:52:52.702
THIS SESSION TO FIND THE URGENCY

00:52:52.769 --> 00:52:54.838
WE WILL NEED TO MATCH THE TASK

00:52:54.905 --> 00:52:56.473
BEFORE US.

00:52:56.540 --> 00:52:57.841
WE CAN DO MORE TO BRIDGER

00:52:57.908 --> 00:52:59.743
DIVIDES TO LIFT UP THOSE WERE

00:52:59.809 --> 00:53:01.912
FALLING BEHIND WE CAN REWARD

00:53:01.978 --> 00:53:02.846
AMBITION.

00:53:02.913 --> 00:53:05.015
AND INGENUITY AND LEARN FROM OUR

00:53:05.081 --> 00:53:06.583
FAILURES.

00:53:06.650 --> 00:53:08.585
WHATEVER THE CASE WE MUST

00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.687
CONTINUE TO TAKE RISK AND TO

00:53:10.754 --> 00:53:12.822
MAKE PROGRESS.

00:53:12.889 --> 00:53:13.757
BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH WE'RE DOING

00:53:13.823 --> 00:53:16.393
WELL WE AREN'T DOING ENOUGH.

00:53:16.459 --> 00:53:17.794
AFTER ALL WE'RE THE STATE OF

00:53:17.861 --> 00:53:20.196
INVENTION NOT CONVENTION.

00:53:20.263 --> 00:53:21.531
AND THAT'S WHAT DEFINES

00:53:21.598 --> 00:53:23.066
CALIFORNIA.

00:53:23.133 --> 00:53:24.601
SOUND FAMILIAR AND AS I THOUGHT

00:53:24.668 --> 00:53:27.037

00:53:27.103 --> 00:53:28.572
THROUGH PIONEERING SPIRIT THAT

00:53:28.638 --> 00:53:30.540
PENSION FOR IMAGINATION IS WHAT

00:53:30.607 --> 00:53:32.576
MADE CALIFORNIA THE ENVY OF THE

00:53:32.642 --> 00:53:34.644
WORLD AND THE FIFTH LARGEST

00:53:34.711 --> 00:53:36.413
ECONOMY ON EARTH.

00:53:36.479 --> 00:53:37.614
WHETHER IT WAS THE VISION OF SO

00:53:37.681 --> 00:53:39.015

EVERY CONTINENT.

00:53:59.769 --> 00:54:02.172
OR THE INGENUITY OF A SON OF A
