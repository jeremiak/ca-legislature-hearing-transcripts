WELCOME SENATOR THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR- FILE ITEM TWO IS ON CONSENT AND THAT'S FINISHED A FILE ITEM THREE SB THREE NINETY FIVE YOU WANT TO START WHEN YOU'RE READY THANK YOU VERY MUCH WELL GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO PRESENT SB THREE NINETY FIVE A TERRIBLE EPIDEMIC HAS PLAGUED OUR YOUTH IN OUR COMMUNITIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS AND IF LEFT UNCHECKED WILL CONTINUE TO DO HARM FOR MANY GENERATIONS TO COME. E. CIGARETTES CONTAIN A HARMFUL COMBINATION OF NICOTINE FLAVORING AND OTHER CHEMICALS ADDITIVES AND ALL THERE THOUGH THEY ARE CURRENTLY TAXED AS OTHER TOBACCO PRODUCTS THE TAX RATE IS MUCH LOWER THAN THAT OF TRADITIONAL CIGARETTES THEREBY CONTRIBUTING TO THE GROWING DISPARITY BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS AND UNDERMINING EFFORTS TO CURB VAPING THIS MEASURE SEEKS TO CREATE PARITY BETWEEN THESE PRODUCTS BEIPING HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR DESPITE THE HIGH RISK OF ADVERSE HEALTH OUTCOMES THIS IS ESPECIALLY PROBLEMATIC AMONG OUR YOUTH. ACCORDING TO THE CDC'S NATIONAL YOUTH TOBACCO SURVEY YOUR 20% OF HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS REPORTED CURRENT E. CIGARETTE USE AND ABOUT 40% REPORTED HEAVY USE OF E. CIGARETTES THE AVAILABILITY OF YOUTH APPEALING FLAVORS SUCH AS GUMMY BEARS AND COTTON CANDY H. ALONG WITH HEAVY MARKETING HAS IN LARGE PART CONTRIBUTED TO THIS TREND TOBACCO RETAILERS ARE MORE PREVALENT IN THE POOREST AND MOST ETHNICALLY DENSE NEIGHBORHOODS WHICH INCLUDES POPULATIONS MOST AT RISK OF INADEQUATE HEALTH CARE ACCESS AND COVERAGE. THAT IS WHY I HAVE INTRODUCED SENATE BILL THREE NINETY FIVE WHICH PROPOSES CLOSER TAX PARITY BETWEEN THE SALE OF VAPE AND TRADITIONAL TOBACCO PRODUCTS PROCEEDS OF THE REVENUE GENERATED GO TOWARDS EXISTING VOTER APPROVED SOURCES INCLUDING EARLY CHILDHOOD SERVICES PUBLIC HEALTH AND HEALTH CARE WORKFORCE PROGRAMS AND FUNDING FOR PHYSICIAN STUDENT LOAN REPAYMENT PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WORKING IN OUR MOST THIS. STUDENT WITH THAT I WOULD LIKE TO INTRODUCE MY WITNESSES KATE WILBUR WHO IS A YOUTH ADVOCATE WITH THE SAN BENITO YOUTH ASSOCIATION. AND SHANNON BECAUSE LOVICH PROGRAM MANAGER FOR EQUALITY CALIFORNIA. THANK YOU- WITH THE SAN BENITO YOUTH ASSOCIATES- WE HAVE YOUR PERSON MY GOODNESS MY FIRST IN PERSON ON THIS WELCOME GO AHEAD PLEASE GOOD AFTERNOON MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS MY NAME IS KATE WILBUR AND I'M THE CHAIRPERSON FOR THE SAN BENITO YOUTH ASSOCIATION FOR THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS MY GROUP AND I HAVE BEEN WORKING TO EDUCATE OUR COMMUNITY ON THE DANGERS OF YOUTH TOBACCO USAGE. SEEING MY FELLOW STUDENTS VAPING IN MY HIGH SCHOOL BATHROOMS AND SEEING EMPTY JEWEL PODS ON THE STREETS OF MY COMMUNITY REALLY WOKE ME UP TO HOW SERIOUS THIS PROBLEM IS BUT THIS PROBLEM ISN'T JUST IN SAN BENITO COUNTY IT IS AN EPIDEMIC THAT IS AFFECTING YOU ACROSS CALIFORNIA. ACCORDING TO THE AMERICAN LUNG ASSOCIATION YOUTH USERS ARE FAR MORE LIKELY TO BECOME LIFELONG TOBACCO USERS. WITH MORE SEVERE ADDICTIONS. AND BIG TOBACCO IS TAKING ADVANTAGE OF THIS FACT- VAPING PRODUCTS THEY ARE TARGETING AND HOOKING KIDS AT AN EARLIER AGE WHEN THEY ARE MORE VULNERABLE AND MORE LIKELY TO BECOME LIFELONG ATTICS. AND SADLY THEIR PREDATORY TACTICS HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL VAPING WITH THEIR FLAVORS AND TARGETED ADS ARE NOW MORE PREVALENT AMONGST YOUTH THAN ANY OTHER AGE GROUP. SADLY THE YOUTH VOTE A VAPING EPIDEMIC HAS ALSO SKYROCKETED OMITS THE PANDEMIC HIGHER LEVELS OF DEPRESSION ANXIETY AND THE ISOLATION HAVE ALL CONTRIBUTED TO HIGHER YOUTH VAPING RATES. PRODUCTS ARE ALSO MORE ACCESSIBLE THAN EVER WITH ONLINE RETAILERS AND THAT IS WHY SB THREE NINETY FIVE IS SO IMPORTANT. THE ADDED TAX WOULD HELP DISCOURAGE YOUNGER USERS AND MICHALEK TRONIC TOBACCO PRODUCTS LESS AVAILABLE MEANWHILE THE PROCEEDS WOULD GO TO ESSENTIAL SERVICES AND TOBACCO. PREVENTION EDUCATION. THE STATE MUST TAKE STEPS IMMEDIATELY. TO PROTECT YOUTH USERS AND PREVENT THEM FROM LIFETIMES OF SUFFERING AND STRUGGLE WITH THE DICTION. IT'S LEGISLATION LIKE SB THREE NINETY FIVE THAT COULD HAVE HELPED MY COUSIN FROM BECOMING ADDICTED AND GETTING KICKED OUT OF HIS HIGH SCHOOL. SB THREE NINETY FIVE SUPPORTS CALIFORNIAN YOUTH. AND WOULD HELP PREVENT THEM FROM MAKING NEGATIVE CHOICES WITH PERMANENT AFFECTS. I URGE YOU TO JOIN ME IN THE FIGHT FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE AND THEIR FUTURES WITH YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

I EACH AND EVERY YEAR I'M ALSO GRATEFUL THAT A PRISON SB FIVE FIVE FIVE WHICH WOULD CREATE A NEW THE INNOVATIVE SYSTEM FOR COLLECTING DISPENSING REVENUE FROM BED TAXES ALSO KNOWN AS T. O. T.

BECAUSE HOSTS ARE NOT ALWAYS AWARE OF THE REQUIREMENT TO BE ABLE TO COLLECT AND REMIT THESE TAXES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS DO NOT ALWAYS KNOW WHAT PROPERTIES ARE BEING USED FOR THE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTALS THIS IS BEEN AN ISSUE THAT WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO TACKLE CANDIDLY SINCE TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN MY FIRST YEAR HERE IN THE LEGISLATURE. THEREFORE WHAT WE KNOW IS LIKELY TENS OF MILLIONS MOST LIKELY HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS IN BED TAX REVENUE GOES UNCOLLECTED AT THE LOCAL LEVEL EVERY YEAR SO WHAT THIS BILL WOULD DO IT WOULD HELP CITIES AND COUNTIES COLLECT THIS UNTAPPED REVENUE BY CREATING A STATEWIDE BED TAX COLLECTION PROGRAM. ADMINISTERED BY THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION- FOR LOCAL G. JURISDICTIONS WHO CHOOSE TO PARTICIPATE THIS IS AFTER THE HARD WORK THAT YOU'RE A WOMAN BURKE DID WITH THE MARKET PLACE FACILITATOR ACT. THIS PROGRAM AT FOR ONLINE VACATION RULES REQUIRE SHORT TERM VACATION RENTAL FACILITATORS SUCH AS AIRBNB OR VR BO THE COLLECTED AT THE APPROPRIATE DATE TAX FROM CUSTOMERS WHEN A SHORT TERM RENTAL IS BOOKED THROUGH THE PLATFORM. THAT PLATFORM WITHIN REMIT THE FUNDS TO THE CALIFORNIA DEPARTMENT OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WHO THEN DISTRIBUTE. THE REVENUE ON A QUARTERLY BASIS TO THE C.

AND EACH CITY CANNOT AT ANY HOTEL ANYTIME GOING BACK UP TO THREE YEARS. UNDER THIS BILL SHORT TERM RENTALS OWNERS IN THE CITY WOULD NOT HAVE TO SUBMIT ANYTHING TO THE CITY. NOTHING UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. NO AUDITING BY THE CITY. INSTEAD IT A STATE TAX AGENCY WILL TALLY UP THE BILL BASED ON THE TAX RETURNS ON THE PLATFORMS LIKE AIRBNB. ANY PROPERTY NOT ON THE PLATFORM WHICH DOES GET THE TAXES AND IT'S COMMON KNOWLEDGE THAT REGULAR CUSTOMERS A SHORT TERM RENTALS GENERALLY DEAL DIRECTLY WITH THE RENTAL OWNERS TO AVOID THE SERVICE FEE LEVIED BY THE PLATFORMS. AGAIN THOSE TRANSACTIONS WITH ESCAPE THE DOT. THE RESULT THAT THAT IF THE RESULT IS THAT MANY SHORT TERM RENTALS STAYS WILL NOT PAY THE T. O. T. GIVEN THAT MOST YOUR TEARS ARE IN EXCESS OF 10% THAT'S A HUGE COMPETITIVE DISADVANTAGE TO HOTELS. AND B. AND B. IS THAT PLAY BY THE RULES.

NO I'M JUST CONCERNED ABOUT- SOME PRACTICAL ASPECTS AGAIN I'M FOR I'M GOING TO VOTE FOR THE BILL OF AFFORD ON THE FLOOR BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS IS REALLY PRACTICAL FOR EXAMPLE SOME CITIES ACCORDING TO THE ANALYSIS. TAX BASED ON THE LIST PRICE NOW. WHAT I WOULD ENVISIONED- THE TAX AUTHORITY DOING HERE IS PEOPLE SEND IN THEIR TAX BILL IN APRIL. YOU CAN SEE WHAT THE GROCERY SEATS WHERE WHAT THEIR TAXABLE RECEIPTS WERE- HOPEFULLY EVERYTHING CAN BE TIED IN WITH COMPUTERS. BUT WHEN YOU SAY CAN BE DONE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S REALLY DONE- LET'S ASK EIGHTY D. ABOUT THEIR COMPUTER SYSTEM SO I HAVE SOME SKEPTICISM- BUT THE TOUGHER PART IS IF IT IS BASED UPON THE LIST PRICE. WHO HAS THAT INFORMATION. THE LIST PRICE AT THE TIME OF THE RENTAL COULD BE QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE LIST PRICE THAT'S AVAILABLE. MORE THAN A YEAR AFTER THE ACTUAL WORK AND YOU CAN SAY ALL RIGHT THAT'LL BE SENT IN BY THE CITY THAT SEEMS LIKE THE BEST WAY TO DO IT. I'M JUST NOT SURE YOU CAN GET ALL THAT TOGETHER AND DO IT RIGHT BYE. BYE LESS THAN IT WELL ABOUT A YEAR FROM NOW. SOON THE BILL PASSES- I JUST. I'VE BEEN INVOLVED ENOUGH A LOT OF COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND THEY DON'T ALWAYS WORK. THE SECOND THING I'M WORRIED ABOUT AND- WHEN THEN PERHAPS YOU COULD ANSWER THAT AND ALSO WHAT DISCUSSIONS HAVE YOU HAD WITH- THE TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION THANK YOU SO MUCH OF THIS WORK THE REASON WHY WE MODELED- THIS BILL OFF OF THE CHAIRWOMAN'S ONLINE FACILITATOR ACT. LEGISLATION IS BECAUSE THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY BEEN CORRECTED I HAVE ALREADY BEEN CREATED SO VERY SIMILAR- THE ONLINE PLATFORM ON A QUARTERLY BASIS WOULD TURN IN UNDER PENALTY OF PERJURY. THOSE TAX OBLIGATIONS THOSE BED TAX OBLIGATIONS FOR THE SPECIFIC COMMUTING WHICH THEY'RE DOING BUSINESS IN. CD TFA WOULD THEN REMIT THOSE- PAYMENTS TO THE CITY OR COUNTY OF ORIGIN- AND SO THE SYSTEM IS ALREADY CREATED WHICH IS GREAT IN ADDITION CD TFA ALSO COLLECTS- A UTILITY USERS TAX FOR ALL OF MUNICIPALITIES AND THEY'RE ALSO RESPONSE FOR SALES TAX SO. I HEAR YOU AND WE ALL- HAVE INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES WITH EDT BUT THE AGENCY IS INCREDIBLY BUTTONED UP AND THANK AND I'M NOT TRYING TO JUST BLOW SMOKE BECAUSE THAT YOUR WOMAN THIS YEAR- BUT- THEY- THEY THEY REALLY HAVE- THE- THEY'VE GONE THROUGH THE BIG KAHUNA IF YOU WILL WITH THIS ONLINE FACILITATOR ACT- IN DEVELOPING THE SYSTEM. OKAY SO YOU'RE SAYING THE- CITY AFFECT THE RENTERS WOULD HAVE TO DO AND QUARTERLY REPORTS AS TO THEIR GROSS INCOME ANY NET INCOME IT WOULD ACTUALLY BE UP TO THE PLATFORM TO THE PLATFORMS SO LIKE FOR EXAMPLE AIRBNB OR EXPEDIA WOULD HAVE TO RENEW IT. IF THERE IS S. AS IN THE REMAINS HAD SAID. IF THE CITY OPSIN. THE PLOT WITH THE REMIT TO THE CAL APARTMENT T. AND IF. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. BASED OFF OF THOSE RECEIPTS IN THAT INDIVIDUAL CITY OR COUNTY'S BED TAX RATE. THAT WILL THOSE DOLLARS WOULD THEN BE REMITTED BACK TO THE CITY NOW CD TFA. FULL TRANSPARENCY AS THEY DO WITH ONLINE FACILITATOR ACT DOES TAKE A VERY SMALL MINISTER TO SEE OFF THE TOP- BUT THAT'S HOW IT WOULD WORK IT WOULD BE BASED OFF OF THE ACTUAL PLATFORM AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL HOME USER WHICH IS WHY IT'S SO CRITICAL THAT THE PLATFORM DOES IT. SO WE'RE NOT BURNING- HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF- HOMEOWNERS. ARM SO THE PROBLEM IS IF THEY'RE DOINGIT BASED ON TAXABLE RECEIPTS THEN YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT IS AND TOLD. PEOPLE FILE THEIR TAXES SO YOU MAY HAVE A QUARTERLY REPORT WHICH YOU'RE NOT GONNA KNOW WHAT THE TAXES WERE UNTIL. A YEAR LATER. IT'S BUT IT'S BASED OFF OF THOSE QUARTERLY THE DID THE BOOK OF BUSINESSES THEY DO IN THAT QUARTER IN THE PAST SO THEY KNOW SO THE- THE ONLINE PLATFORM KNOWS. HOW MANY ROOM NIGHTS SO FOR EXAMPLE IF. OKAY YOUR TURN BACK GROCERY SEATS. SOME PEOPLE TAX BASED UPON TAXABLE. RIGHT INCOME YOU DON'T KNOW THAT UNTIL THE END OF THE YEAR AND YOU'VE- PUT UP ALL OF YOUR INCOME AND ALL OF YOUR DEDUCTIONS. SO FOR A OF HOPE THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS YOU WANT CD- THE TAX AND- FIFTH ALREADY DO THIS BECAUSE THEY PRESUMABLY HAVE THE TAX INFORMATION BUT THAT TAX INFORMATION ISN'T AVAILABLE QUARTERLY IT'S AVAILABLE. AFTER YOU FINISH THE YEAR AND YOU SUBTRACT EXPENSES FROM INCOME WELL CURRENTLYRIGHT NOW WE'RE JUST MODELING THIS OFF OF AND I'M NOT TRYING TO BE- NOT NOT TRYING TO- GO AROUND YOUR QUESTION THE BOTTOM LINE IS THIS. SO RIGHT NOW IF FOR EXAMPLE THE CITY OF HILLS BURKE. COLLECTS AND THEY ALLOWED VACATION RENTALS- IN THE TO VOLUNTARY COLLECTION AGREEMENT THE CITY HILLS BURKE WITH AIRBNB WOULD GET A CHECK EVERY QUARTER BASED OFF OF THE ACTUAL. DATE BOOK OF BUSINESS I HEAR YOU IN REGARD TO THE HOMEOWNER- BUT THAT'S THAT'S CURRENTLY HOW THIS WOULD BE STRUCTURED OKAY SO YOU'RE NOT GOING TO TAKE INTO ACCOUNT THE WAY SOME CITIES DO IT. WHERE IT'S ON TAXABLE INCOME IT WOULD BE BASED OFF OF THE NUMBER OF ROOM NIGHTS OKAY SO YOU JUST SIMPLIFIED IT AND YOU SAID CITY IF YOU WANT TO DO THIS. YOU CAN'T DO IT BASED ON TAXABLE INCOME YOU PROBABLY CAN'T DO IT BASED ON LIST PRICE YOU HAVE TO DO IT ON GROSS INCOME AT THE TIME EXACTLY. THAT THAT ANSWERS MY QUESTION ONCE YOU'VE GOT THAT. THEN YES I THINK YOU CAN DO IT THE SECOND PART OF THIS. IS IT'S GONNA BE HARD TO SIGN PEOPLE UP. IF THEY HAVE TO PAY UP FRONT. FOR BRINGING UP THE SYSTEM. AND. I WISH YOU HAD JUST ASK FOR MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND THIS IS A GOOD YEAR TO GET IT. I DON'T KNOW BUT I'VE GOTTEN SOME MONEY FROM THE GENERAL FUND FOR VARIOUS THINGS THIS YEAR THIS IS HERE WHEN YOU CRANK UP FOR LOST TIME. TO JUST FUND THE START UP ON THIS AND I YOU KNOW I JUST THINK THINGS WILL GO MUCH BETTER. IT MIGHT NOT BE TOO LATE. WE DON'T KNOW EXACTLY WHAT THE BUDGET AGREEMENT IS GOING TO BE. I JUST WISH YOU WOULD DO THAT OKAY THEN I THINK IT WOULD BE MUCH EASIER TO SIGN PEOPLE UP GOSH ALL RIGHT SO THANK YOU FOR CLARIFYING THAT IT'S JUST GOING TO BE ON GROCERY SEEDS. THAT WORKS I LOVE IT. SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM THANK YOU AND WE ARE LOOKING AT- START UP COSTS RIGHT NOW ON A SIMILAR WORK AND I TOOK SOME NOTES AS YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT IN REGARD SEE YOUR REQUEST THAT WE LOOK FOR START UP- I WANT TO GO BACK AND TAKE A LOOK AT THAT AND I'M GRATEFUL FOR YOUR FEEDBACK. OKAY THANK YOU. SACRAMENTO COURSE. OKAY I APOLOGIZE I AM THE- ONE HOLDING UP SENATE SESSION AND- AS A BEEN HOLDING- THE ROLE OPEN. GUY APOLOGIZE WOULD IT BE ALRIGHT IF THE ASSEMBLY MEMBER OF COURSE. WORK THAT SENATE MAJORITY LEADER STEPS IN. I REALLY. LIKE JACKSONVILLE HIM. I APOLOGIZE THANK YOU. CORRECT I APOLOGIZE WE WILL WE WILL BE VERY GENTLE WITH HIM THANK YOU CAN ASK. TOUGH QUESTIONS AS YOU WANT. I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP AS THEY GO DOOR. LISTEN I DO NOT KNOW THE WE DIDN'T AND THEN THANK. DO YOU WANT TO MAKE IT JUST A CALM. MISTER OKAY RESIDENTS I MAY HAVE LIED I THOUGHT WE GOING TO REGION APPARENTLY NO IT'S OKAY CAN ANSWER QUESTIONS. REMEMBER GRAYSON HI IF I CAN'T TAKE IT TO. FOR ALL THESE YEARS. SELECCIONA DELIGHTED TO BE ABLE TO ASK SENATOR HERTZBERG QUESTION THANK YOU CHAIR MADAM CHAIR AND- MY COLLEAGUE- FROM PALM SPRINGS- ALREADY INVOKED- THE HIGHEST AUTHORITY EMPOWER MY COLON AT THE LORD'S WORK- SO NOT SURE IF MY QUESTION REALLY MATTERS AT THIS POINT- BUT I DO WANT TO. ASK A QUESTION. BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE BILL IS LAUDABLE- IN THE EFFORTS OF THE AUTHOR. NOT ALL ONLINE OPERATORS OPERATE THE SIX CORRECT SO YOU HAVE A VERY PROMINENT OPERATOR. THAT HAS ONE MODEL BUT THEN THERE ARE OTHER- ONLINE OPERATORS THAT OPERATE UNDER A DIFFERENT MODEL. ONE PROMINENT OPERATOR TAKES MONEY DIRECTLY FROM THE PERSON RENTING OR THE SHORT TERMRENTAL WHEREAS OTHER ONLINE OPERATORS ARE JUST FACILITATORS WHERE THEY CONNECT THE RENTER WITH THE PROPERTY OWNER THAT'S PROVIDING THE SPACE. SO IS THIS BILL- DIFFERENTIATING BETWEEN THE TWO- SO THAT- THE PERSON THAT IS TRULY LIABLE FOR PAYING THE TAX. IS THE ONE ACTUALLY PAYING THE TAX I BELIEVE IT IS THE CASE AND I WOULD TELL YOU THAT. AS WE HAVE OVER THE MANY YEARS HAVE DEALT WITH THESE ISSUES WHAT IT WAS INTERNET TAXATION OR THE LIKE. WILL END AND WE HAVE DEALT SENATE MCGUIRE INTRODUCED A BILL LIKE THIS THAT I DIDN'T PASSED WHEN I WAS CHAIR OF HIS COMMITTEE- BECAUSE I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS COOKED- AND SO IT'S A LOT BETTER NOW. BUT BUT- LOOKI THINK IT'S GONNA BE SOME CHALLENGES I THINK TO SOME CHALLENGES WITH AGENTS WE SEE WITH GRUBHUB WE SEE WITH A WHOLE HOST OF OTHER ISSUES WE FACE THIS. BUT I THINK THAT THIS IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP. WITH RESPECT TO BASICALLY DEALING WITH THIS DYNAMIC BETWEEN TRANSPORTATION ARCHITECTS DOT HOTELS AND HOW THIS WORKS HOW DO WE SUPPORT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS GET THEM REVENUES. THERE'S GONNA BE SOME HICK UPS THERE'S NO QUESTION ABOUT IT SO- THE GOOD NEWS IS TO BE. MORE LEGISLATION NEXT YEAR WHAT WILL NO DOUBT- HICK UPS ARE VERY ANNOYING. AND WE OUR BEST TO TRY TO GET RID OF THOSE HICCUPS AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE SO I WOULD JUST SIMPLY ASK THAT- CENTER STANDING IN FOR THE AUTHOR THAT YOU AND THE AUTHOR. AS WELL AS- THOSE LOOKING AT THE BILL IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE. VERY COGNISANT OF THE FACT THAT THERE MIGHT BE A SITUATION WHERE AN ONLINE PROVIDER IS. BEING HELD LIABLE FOR SOMETHING THAT THEY ARE ACTUALLY NOT LIABLE FOR ANYTHING THAT WOULD FOLLOW THANK YOU SIR AND LET ME DO IT LET ME DO MY BEST TO. HELP IN THIS SITUATION WE ARE AWARE OF BOOKING DOT COM'S OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE HAVE PROPOSED THE SENATOR PROPOSED SOME AMENDMENTS- AS LATE AS TODAY. THEY DID NOT SATISFY HOWEVER WE ARE VERY WELL AWARE THAT THEY HAVE A HYBRID MODEL AND I MADE I BELIEVE THE CENTER WILL CONTINUE TO TRY TO WORK TO FIGURE OUT THE BEST WAY TO NOT CREATE A LOOPHOLE. FOR THE OTHERS BUT TO. DEAL WITH THEIR- EIGHT WITH THEIR INDIVIDUAL SORT OF SITUATION THAT THEY FIND THEMSELVES AND I WILL ENCOURAGE HIM TO DO SO CONTINUE TO DO SO AS WE HAVE OVER THE WEEKEND THANK THAT WAS JOIN WITH YOU MAN AND- YOUR- KNOW. I'M HERE. I SAW HER IT'S GREAT THAT YOU'RE HERE- IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL AFTER HAVING CONCERNS WITH THE EARLIER VERSION- IT'S REALLY FANTASTICAL TO WORK ON ISSUES LIKE THIS AND FIND THAT GROUND AND WE'RE CERTAIN CERTAINLY SOLVING A REAL ISSUE IN A REAL PROBLEM ONE OF THE THINGS I THINK THE SENATOR THE AUTHOR HAD MENTIONED EARLIER WAS BEING MORE SPECIFIC ABOUT WHERE THE RENTALS WERE LOCATED I THINK THAT WAS LIKE ADDRESS SPECIFICITY- THAT MAYBE YOU HAD CONCERNS WITH IN. PRIOR VERSIONS IS THAT RIGHT HE TOUCHED ME A LITTLE BIT ABOUT THE APPREHENSION IN THE IN THE PRIOR VERSIONS YOU KNOW THOSE ISSUES THAT'S ALL RIGHT THAT YOU'RE HERE TO TALK ABOUT IT DIRECTLY RATHER THAN. THAN THE AUTHORS SO THANK YOU. IT WAS LIKE FIVE YEARS AGO I THINK. FEDERAL MEMBER ALL THE DETAILS BUT MY RECOLLECTION IS HAD TO DO WITH KIND OF. THE LAND USE ISSUES AND NEIGHBORS VERSES AND BEING ANONYMOUS AND WITH THE CITY COULD STILL GET THE REVENUE ON THE ONE HAND BUT YOU WOULDN'T HAVE. THE KINDS OF OTHER CHALLENGES THAT AFFAIR OFTEN THE CURRENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO- THAT WAS A THAT WAS A BIG ISSUE. YEAH I THINK WE YOU KNOW. SOMETHING THAT WE'RE ALL AWARE OF- FROM OUR COMMUNITIES IS CITIES TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHERE. THAT'S RIGHT THESE RENTALS ARE THAT'S RIGHT- USUALLY BECAUSE THERE'S SOMETHING PROBLEMATIC ABOUT THEM MAYBE ALSO WANTED THE T. O. T. AS WELL- AND THAT THEY'RE TRYING TO. JUST GET A HANDLE ON IT AS IT'S YOU KNOW. COMMUNITIES LIKE MINE WHICH HAS A LOT OF TOURISM AND PEOPLE WANT TO COME FOR A WEEKEND OR FOR A SHORT STAY- YES SO. DOES THIS BILL PROVIDE ANY TYPE OF SPECIFICITY AS TO LIKE WHICH- PROPERTIES ARE PRODUCING WHAT. WHAT TAX. I YOU KNOW JOHN ALLEN'S. I DON'T RECALL TO BE HONEST WITH YOU YEAH I DON'T THINK. I DO KNOW THAT I'M SURE YEAH IT'S SO CD TFA OBVIOUSLY WILL COLLECT A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INFORMATION NOW THAT INFORMATION I BELIEVE AND I'M WAITING FOR I'LL GET AHEAD NOT OVER HERE BUT MY UNDERSTANDING IS THAT. INFORMATION WILL STAY IN THE POSSESSION OF CD TFA I'M GONNA DIS AGGREGATED AMOUNT OF INFORMATION WILL BE PASSED ON TO THE LOCALS. IN TIME AND IN YEAH- AND IT IS IT WAS CREATED THAT WAY BY DESIGN. OF THE ISSUES IN THE PAST VERSIONS YET AT THIS BILL MAYBE WOULDN'T BE THIS FAR IF IT HAD MORE SPECIFICITY WHAT ONE THING THAT'S INTERESTING TO ME IS UNDERSTANDING. THE TAXABLE INCOME OR THE REVENUE WILL. BUY A PROPERTY OR TYPE OF PROPERTY I MEAN THAT'S NOT. NECESSARILY LOCATION SPECIFIC BUT WE HAVE THE TAP THIS TYPE OF GRANULARITY TO UNDERSTAND THE ACTIVITY IN OUR COMMUNITIES. I THINK THAT YOU CAN TALK TO. THE AUTHOR ABOUT IT PUTTING ON THE CD YEAH I MEAN I SEE TO YOU THEY WILL HAVE A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INFORMATION AND I'M SURE HE'S HAPPY TO DISCUSS WITH YOU WHAT'S WHAT INFORMATION IS PUSHED FORWARD AND WHAT'S NOT AS LONG AS IT'S NOT. YOU KNOW COMPLETELY DETAILED I THINK THE PURPOSES FOR TO BE A DISAGGREGATED INFORMATION BUT EVEN WITH THAT YOU CAN GET WHAT YOU'RE ASKING FOR WHICH IS GENERAL LOCATION GENERAL AREA MUCH TOP POSSIBLY AT AND I MEAN THIS BILL SOLVING REAL PROBLEMS IS THE FACILITATOR ISSUES REAL AND- YEAH THAT'S THAT'S THE- NUMBER. ONE YOU KNOW PART OF THIS WHOLE TRIAGE THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH HERE THANK YOU FOR STEP IN AND- COURSE THANK YOU- RIGHT. SO MY QUESTION IS HELLO OF CITY- AND- THE FUNDS. HAVE EXPERTISE IN THIS NOW FOR THE LAST YEAR. IN OUR CITY WE WERE DEALING WITH THIS- WE USE WE'VE ACTUALLY LANDED WITH A THIRD PARTY FACILITATOR WHO DOES ALL OF THE COLLECTION. FOR ALL OF THAT INFORMATION. BECAUSE THIS SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THAT CD TIERS TRYING TO JUST BE THE- FACILITATOR OF THE COLLECTING OF CORRECT THE STUFF. THEY DON'T THEY THEY'RE NOT GONNA GO OUT THERE AND RESEARCHING GO THROUGH CODE ENFORCEMENT DO ALL THOSE THINGS TO FIND OUT WHO'S RENTING WHO'S NOT. THEY'RE GONNA BE USING COORDINATION WITH THE PLATFORMS. AND WHATEVER THE CITY'S MECHANISMS ARE FOR OBTAINING INFORMATION AND ONCE THEY HAVE THAT AND THEN THEY CAN DO THEIR THING. CORRECT CORRECT CORRECT ALL RIGHT SO BECAUSE AND THAT'S WHAT WE NEED TO SEPARATE IS WHAT THEY'RE GOING TO DO. FIRST IS WHAT THE CITY'S RESPONSIBILITY AS AN- MISTER MISTER CORK HERE TALKING ABOUT THAT EARLIER. IS YOU KNOW HOW DO WE KNOW. WELL THE CITIES HAVE TO TAKE A PROACTIVE ROLE IN DOING THAT IF THEY WANT TO. AND A AND I THINK THAT'S HOW THEY WIND UP DOING THAT- THE TOT TAX ARE ACTUALLY COLLECTED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS- THE OWNERS HAVE TO REPORT TO. NINETY ASSESSOR NAY THEY DO THAT THEY THEY WIND UP WRITING A CHECK EVERY QUARTER FOR THAT. EIGHT ZERO T. MY RECOLLECTION. FROM MY OWN PERSONAL EXPERIENCES ALWAYS- ON. JUST A GROSS NUMBERS RISE NUMBER BASED UPON A ROOM OCCUPANCY NOT BASED UPON. A TAXABLE INCOME AFTER DEDUCTIONS DEPRECIATION ON OUR NO IT'S JUST IT'S THE NUMBER OF FLAT NUMBER FLAT NUMBER FROM YOU KNOW IF YOU'RE GOING FOR FIFTY A NIGHT. GET YOUR TEA IS. FIVE DOLLARS THAT'S RIGHT- SO THEY WILL BE WORKING WITH THE- THIRD PARTY ADMINISTRATOR NAY CITY HIRES TO BE ABLE TO DO THAT INFORMATION TO COLLECT THAT TAX. THERE'S NOTHING IN THIS BILL THAT PREVENTS THEM FROM DOING. WHAT JUST A CURIOSITY BECAUSE- WHAT CITY WAS THAT THAT THAT DO YOU HAVE- DID THAT WITH YOU. WHAT'S WITH CITY MARIANNA I'M HERE AT HOT pYEAH. SO- SO ANYWAY SO THAT'S WHY THAT AND THAT'S BASICALLY THE IN THERE WAS ENSURING THAT THEY WILL WITH THE FOR PARTY AND THAT THE SOMEHOW CAME OUT BECAUSE THAT'S HOW THAT GETS CLEAN THAT'S RIGHT RIGHT THANK YOU THIS ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WITH THAT I THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBERS ARE TO DID A REALLY GOOD JOB OF SEPARATING WHAT THE ISSUES ARE THERE'S THE ONE INFORMATION ISSUE ABOUT THE INFORMATION INCLUDING WHETHER PEOPLE SHOULD BE RENTING IN THE SEPARATE INFORMATION IS ABOUT THE COLLECTING OF THOSE TAXES AND CREATING A SYSTEM. THAT WILL HELP CITIES THAT HAVE NOT CREATED THEIR OWN SYSTEM TO DO IT WITH A LITTLE BIT MORE EASE SO. WITH THAT. SENATOR WHICH- WAS. YEAH I HAVE KIND OF A LONG STATEMENT I WANT TO SHARE WITH YOU. ABOUT THIS MEASURE. AND ABOUT THE- COMPETENCY IN THE INTEGRITY OF THE AUTHOR. OF THIS MEASURE. BUT I THINK THAT'S A GIVEN THE CIRCUMSTANCES I'LL PASS ON THAT THE MANAGER AND MEMBERS AND- SIMPLY ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE ON BEHALF CENTER MCGUIRE THANK YOU SIR. WITH THAT MISS HIGHLANDER WOULD YOU CALL THE ROLL- WITH THE FROM MY UNDERSTANDING THERE WERE AMENDMENTS. OKAY GIVEN THE MOTION AND MOTION BY MAY SECOND BACK FOR. AND THIS TIME WE DO THE MOTION IS.
