AS PROP NINETY EIGHT THAT SIX

00:47:25.776 --> 00:47:26.610
HUNDRED AND EIGHTY MILLION AS

GOING FOR THESE PURPOSES.

00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:45.395
THE SECOND PAGE JUST SUMMARIZES

00:47:45.462 --> 00:47:46.897
ALL OF THE CAP OUTLAY HIGHER AT

00:47:46.964 --> 00:47:48.498
PROPOSALS AND THE GOVERNOR'S

YOU CAN ALSO SEE DIFFERENCES

00:47:57.074 --> 00:47:58.041
HERE SO IN THE COMMUNITY

00:47:58.108 --> 00:48:00.177
COLLEGES THE ADMINISTRATION

00:48:00.244 --> 00:48:01.979
PROPOSES FUNDING PULMONARY PLANS

00:48:02.045 --> 00:48:03.647
AND WORKING DRAWINGS FOR TWELVE

00:48:03.714 --> 00:48:05.616
NEW PROJECTS TOTALING EIGHTEEN

MILLION.

00:48:06.383 --> 00:48:07.784
IN PROP --

00:48:07.851 --> 00:48:09.353
ONE IN PROP FIFTY ONE BOND

00:48:09.419 --> 00:48:11.722
RELATED COSTS. FOR CSU HE'S

00:48:11.788 --> 00:48:13.423
PROPOSING FUNDING ALL OF THE

00:48:13.490 --> 00:48:15.392
PHASES OF THE PROJECTS IN ONE

00:48:15.459 --> 00:48:17.060
YEAR USING UNIVERSITY BOND

00:48:17.127 --> 00:48:18.962
FUNDING FOR THAT. FOR THE UC

00:48:19.029 --> 00:48:20.764
PROJECTS IT'S THE CONSTRUCTION

00:48:20.831 --> 00:48:22.866
PHASE OF MOST OF THESE PROJECTS

00:48:22.933 --> 00:48:27.170
ALSO USING UNIVERSITY BOND FUNDS.

00:48:27.237 --> 00:48:28.372
SO THE REST OF THE HAND OUT AS

00:48:28.438 --> 00:48:29.706
OUR ASSESSMENT AT A HIGH LEVEL

00:48:29.773 --> 00:48:31.341
OF THESE PROPOSALS.

00:48:31.408 --> 00:48:32.209
AS YOU'VE HEARD THE NEW

00:48:32.276 --> 00:48:33.610
ADMINISTRATION IS TAKING A

00:48:33.677 --> 00:48:35.012
FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT APPROACH

00:48:35.078 --> 00:48:36.913
THAN THE BROWN ADMINISTRATION SO

00:48:36.980 --> 00:48:38.348
THIS ADMINISTRATION AS

00:48:38.415 --> 00:48:40.784
CONNECTING AUGMENTATIONS TO

00:48:40.851 --> 00:48:42.386
SPECIFIC BUDGET PRIORITIES.

00:48:42.452 --> 00:48:43.754
WHEN WE TURN TO LOOKING OUT

00:48:43.820 --> 00:48:45.589
SPECIFIC BUDGET PROPOSALS THERE

00:48:45.656 --> 00:48:46.823
ARE SOME THAT WE THINK ARE REAL

00:48:46.890 --> 00:48:48.725
WELL CRAFTED THERE'S DATA THAT

00:48:48.792 --> 00:48:50.160
THE ADMINISTRATION CAN PROVIDE

00:48:50.227 --> 00:48:51.628
TO DEMONSTRATE THERE'S A PROBLEM

00:48:51.695 --> 00:48:53.397
OR AN OPPORTUNITY THERE IS A

00:48:53.463 --> 00:48:54.898
CLEAR POLICY OBJECTIVE?

00:48:54.965 --> 00:48:56.199
IS CONNECTED WITH A POLICY

00:48:56.266 --> 00:48:58.268
SOLUTION THAT'S TIGHTLY ALIGNED

00:48:58.335 --> 00:48:59.636
THERE'S AN ACCURATE COST US TO

00:48:59.703 --> 00:49:01.338
MEN THERE ARE PROVISIONS FOR

00:49:01.405 --> 00:49:02.839
MAKING SURE THERE'S TRANSPARENCY

00:49:02.906 --> 00:49:04.374
AND ACCOUNTABILITY ABOUT HOW THE

00:49:04.441 --> 00:49:05.575
MONEY IS BEING USED.

00:49:05.642 --> 00:49:06.610
AND THEN THERE ARE OTHER

00:49:06.677 --> 00:49:09.680
PROPOSALS WERE ONE OR MORE OF SO

00:49:09.746 --> 00:49:10.747
THAT'S WHAT THE REST OF THIS

00:49:10.814 --> 00:49:12.249
HANDOUT IS ABOUT.

00:49:12.316 --> 00:49:14.217
SO COMPENSATION IS ONE AREA

00:49:14.284 --> 00:49:14.951
WHERE THE GOVERNOR IS

00:49:15.018 --> 00:49:16.720
DESIGNATING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCE

00:49:16.787 --> 00:49:18.322
SAYS HERE THERE ARE SOME

00:49:18.388 --> 00:49:19.623
DIFFERENCES ACROSS THE STATEMENT

00:49:19.690 --> 00:49:21.591
SO DEPENDING ON THE STATEMENT

00:49:21.658 --> 00:49:23.026
THE SPECIFIC EMPLOYEE GROUPS.

00:49:23.093 --> 00:49:24.361
THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET HAS

00:49:24.428 --> 00:49:26.396
FUNDING SUFFICIENT COVER BETWEEN

00:49:26.463 --> 00:49:27.331
TWO AND A HALF AND THREE AND A

00:49:27.397 --> 00:49:30.133
HALF PERCENT SALARY INCREASES.

00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:31.301
THE ONE MAJOR EXCEPTION IS FOR

00:49:31.368 --> 00:49:32.769
YOU SEE NON REPRESENTED

00:49:32.836 --> 00:49:34.204
EMPLOYEES SUCH AS ABOUT TWO

00:49:34.271 --> 00:49:35.939
THIRDS OF THEIR CORE FUNDED

00:49:36.006 --> 00:49:37.974
STAFF THE BUDGET DOESN'T INCLUDE

00:49:38.041 --> 00:49:39.643
AN INCREASE FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES.

00:49:39.710 --> 00:49:42.112
YOU SEE HAS REQUESTED 3% THE

00:49:42.179 --> 00:49:43.380
ADMINISTRATION HAS INDICATED

00:49:43.447 --> 00:49:44.681
THAT MAYBE YOU SEE CAN YOU HAVE

00:49:44.748 --> 00:49:46.550
ALTERNATE A FUND SOURCES TO

00:49:46.616 --> 00:49:48.018
COVER THAT COST BUT IT'S NOT IN

00:49:48.085 --> 00:49:51.488
THE EXPLICIT BUDGET BEFORE YOU.

00:49:51.555 --> 00:49:52.055
FOUR IN A ROW FOR A MOMENT

00:49:52.122 --> 00:49:53.290
GROWTH YOU'VE ALSO ALREADY HEARD

00:49:53.357 --> 00:49:54.725
ABOUT DIFFERENCES THE

00:49:54.791 --> 00:49:56.293
ADMINISTRATION IS FINDING ABOUT

00:49:56.360 --> 00:49:57.994
HALF A PERCENTAGE POINT GROWTH

00:49:58.061 --> 00:50:00.130
AT THE COLLEGE'S 2% GROWTH THAT

00:50:00.197 --> 00:50:02.799
CSU AND NOTHING FOR YOU SEE IT

00:50:02.866 --> 00:50:04.167
AND NINETEEN TWENTY THERE'S NO

00:50:04.234 --> 00:50:06.136
CLEAR GUIDING RATIONALE FOR WHY

00:50:06.203 --> 00:50:07.337
THE ADMINISTRATION IS TREATING.

00:50:07.404 --> 00:50:08.839
THE SEGMENTS DIFFERENTLY IN THIS

00:50:08.905 --> 00:50:10.507
REGARD.

00:50:10.574 --> 00:50:12.109
THE ADMINISTRATION IS FUNDING

00:50:12.175 --> 00:50:13.643
STUDENT IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES

00:50:13.710 --> 00:50:15.178
OUT ALL THREE SEGMENTS ALSO

00:50:15.245 --> 00:50:16.780
YOU'VE HEARD ABOUT THIS TAP ON

00:50:16.847 --> 00:50:18.348
OUTCOMES BASED FUNDING FOR THE

00:50:18.415 --> 00:50:19.649
COLLEGES.

00:50:19.716 --> 00:50:20.984
WE ARE CONCERNED ABOUT CAPTAIN

00:50:21.051 --> 00:50:22.986
THAT AS A DISINCENTIVE FOR

00:50:23.053 --> 00:50:24.521
COLLEGES TO IMPROVE.

00:50:24.588 --> 00:50:25.789
ALSO AT THIS POINT IN TIME YOU

00:50:25.856 --> 00:50:27.190
DON'T HAVE A LOT OF DETAIL ON

00:50:27.257 --> 00:50:28.492
HOW YOU SEE WOULD USE ITS

00:50:28.558 --> 00:50:29.793
IMPROVEMENT FUNDING WHETHER IT

00:50:29.860 --> 00:50:31.328
WOULD JUST BE FOR UNDERGRADUATES

00:50:31.395 --> 00:50:32.562
AND IT WOULD GO FOR IMPROVING

00:50:32.629 --> 00:50:33.897
GRADUATION RATES AND NARROWING

00:50:33.964 --> 00:50:35.165
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS.

00:50:35.232 --> 00:50:36.867
OR WHETHER IT ALSO MIGHT GO TO

00:50:36.933 --> 00:50:38.368
GRADUATE STUDENTS FACULTY

00:50:38.435 --> 00:50:39.870
RESEARCH OTHER IMPROVEMENT

00:50:39.936 --> 00:50:41.772
INITIATIVES.

00:50:41.838 --> 00:50:42.873
PAGE FOUR OF THE HAND OUT THE

00:50:42.939 --> 00:50:44.841
GOVERNOR'S ALSO TAKING NOTABLY

00:50:44.908 --> 00:50:46.243
DIFFERENT APPROACHES --

00:50:46.309 --> 00:50:47.411
TOWARD DEALING WITH STUDENTS

00:50:47.477 --> 00:50:49.379
LIVING COSTS AND MENTAL HEALTH

00:50:49.446 --> 00:50:51.748
ISSUES SO AS CSU HE'S FUNDING

00:50:51.815 --> 00:50:53.383
THESE INITIATIVES ON A ONE TIME

00:50:53.450 --> 00:50:55.085
BASIS.

00:50:55.152 --> 00:50:56.620
THE JUST THERE IS THAT CSU WOULD

00:50:56.686 --> 00:50:58.221
WORK WITH DS ASKED TO TRY TO

00:50:58.288 --> 00:51:00.090
HAVE BETTER COORDINATION AS WELL

00:51:00.157 --> 00:51:01.525
AS LOCAL AGENCIES WORKING WITH

00:51:01.591 --> 00:51:03.293
CAMPUSES TO HAVE BETTER

00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:04.728
COORDINATION.

00:51:04.795 --> 00:51:05.262
HE FUNDS THESE EFFORTS ON

00:51:05.328 --> 00:51:07.631
ONGOING BASIS AT UC AND IT'S NOT

00:51:07.697 --> 00:51:09.099
CLEAR YET WHETHER THAT FUNDING

00:51:09.166 --> 00:51:10.267
WOULD GO INTO THEIR REGULAR

00:51:10.333 --> 00:51:11.868
FINANCIALLY PROGRAM OR WHETHER

00:51:11.935 --> 00:51:13.837
IT WOULD GO FOR TARGETED FOOD

00:51:13.904 --> 00:51:15.105
AND HOUSING INITIATIVES.

00:51:15.172 --> 00:51:16.440
HE PROVIDES AN ONGOING

00:51:16.506 --> 00:51:17.941
AUGMENTATION FOR MENTAL HEALTH

00:51:18.008 --> 00:51:20.010
INITIATIVES THAT YOU SEE BUT NO

00:51:20.076 --> 00:51:21.278
AUGMENTATION OF THE OTHER TWO

00:51:21.344 --> 00:51:23.914
SEGMENTS. FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES

00:51:23.980 --> 00:51:25.549
HE HAS NO SPECIFIC FOOD AND

00:51:25.615 --> 00:51:27.083
HOUSING RELATED PROPOSAL BUT HE

00:51:27.150 --> 00:51:28.885
IS PROPOSING TO INCREASE THE CAL

00:51:28.952 --> 00:51:30.887
GRANT JUST FOR STUDENT PARENTS

00:51:30.954 --> 00:51:31.822
TO HELP WITH FOOD LIVING AND

00:51:31.888 --> 00:51:32.289
OTHER.

00:51:32.355 --> 00:51:33.757
FOOD HOUSING AND OTHER LIVING

00:51:33.824 --> 00:51:35.592
COSTS.

00:51:35.659 --> 00:51:36.893
THE MAJORITY OF STUDENT PARENTS

00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:39.029
DO ATTEND COMMUNITY COLLEGE AS

00:51:39.095 --> 00:51:40.597
SO LOOKING AT ALL OF THESE

00:51:40.664 --> 00:51:42.232
PROPOSALS IT DOES SEEM LIKE THE

00:51:42.299 --> 00:51:43.900
GOVERNOR LACKS THE VISION FOR

00:51:43.967 --> 00:51:45.202
HOW HE WANTS THE STATE TO

00:51:45.268 --> 00:51:47.170
ADDRESS STUDENTS LIVING COSTS

00:51:47.237 --> 00:51:48.572
AND MENTAL HEALTH ISSUES.

00:51:48.638 --> 00:51:49.673
REGARDING TOP OUTLAY THE

00:51:49.739 --> 00:51:51.875
GOVERNOR IS BEING SELECTIVE HE'S

00:51:51.942 --> 00:51:53.577
GOING THROUGH PROJECT BY PROJECT

00:51:53.643 --> 00:51:54.778
AND FIGURING OUT WHETHER THERE

00:51:54.845 --> 00:51:56.913
IS JUSTIFICATION FOR THE PROJECT

00:51:56.980 --> 00:51:58.715
YOU CAN SEE THE ADMINISTRATION

00:51:58.782 --> 00:52:00.684
IS ONLY APPROVING TWELVE OF THE

00:52:00.750 --> 00:52:02.052
THIRTY NINE PROJECTS THAT THE

00:52:02.118 --> 00:52:03.119
CHANCELLOR'S OFFICE SUBMITTED TO

00:52:03.186 --> 00:52:04.621
IT. ELEVEN OF EIGHTEEN PROJECTS

00:52:04.688 --> 00:52:07.190
THAT.

00:52:07.257 --> 00:52:09.326
ALL OF THE UC PROJECTS --

00:52:09.392 --> 00:52:10.527
ARE BEING APPROVED BY THE

00:52:10.594 --> 00:52:11.962
ADMINISTRATION AT THIS POINT

00:52:12.028 --> 00:52:13.129
THERE'S ALSO SOME EXPLICIT

00:52:13.196 --> 00:52:14.931
CRITERIA THAT THE ADMINISTRATION

00:52:14.998 --> 00:52:16.700
IS USING THAT WE ALSO THINK IT'S

00:52:16.766 --> 00:52:18.168
A POSITIVE STARTING POINT.

00:52:18.235 --> 00:52:19.436
ALTHOUGH WE THINK THERE ARE

00:52:19.503 --> 00:52:20.570
OPPORTUNITIES FOR GREATER

00:52:20.637 --> 00:52:22.372
TRANSPARENCY FOR MORE

00:52:22.439 --> 00:52:23.707
CONSISTENCY --

00:52:23.773 --> 00:52:25.008
UNDERSTANDING BETWEEN THE

00:52:25.075 --> 00:52:26.543
SEGMENTS THE ADMINISTRATION AND

00:52:26.610 --> 00:52:29.246
YOU ON WHAT CRITERIA ARE BEING

00:52:29.312 --> 00:52:30.647
USED TO EVALUATE THOSE PROPOSALS.

00:52:30.714 --> 00:52:31.681
AND YOU FOR THAT THE GOVERNOR

00:52:31.748 --> 00:52:33.083
DOESN'T WANT TO RAISE TUITION

00:52:33.149 --> 00:52:34.518
AND ALSO WANTS TO ENGAGE WITH

00:52:34.584 --> 00:52:35.719
THE UNIVERSITIES HAVE A

00:52:35.785 --> 00:52:36.686
CONVERSATION ABOUT HOW TO

00:52:36.753 --> 00:52:39.789
PROMOTE TUITION PREDICTABILITY --

00:52:39.856 --> 00:52:40.824
BUT HE DOESN'T HAVE A EXPLICIT

00:52:40.891 --> 00:52:42.492
PLAN FOR HOW TO DO THAT MOVING

00:52:42.559 --> 00:52:43.960
FORWARD.

00:52:44.027 --> 00:52:45.428
SO THE LAST TWO PAGES OF MY HAND

00:52:45.495 --> 00:52:47.330
OUT FOCUS ON SOME AREAS WHERE

00:52:47.397 --> 00:52:48.732
YOU MIGHT CONSIDER BUILDING UPON

00:52:48.798 --> 00:52:50.267
THE GOVERNOR'S PROPOSALS

00:52:50.333 --> 00:52:52.269
IMPROVING THEM REPLACING THEM

00:52:52.335 --> 00:52:53.870
WITH YOUR OWN PRIORITIES.

00:52:53.937 --> 00:52:55.338
MAYBE STEPPING BACK TAKING TIME

00:52:55.405 --> 00:52:57.040
TO COLLECT MORE INFORMATION

00:52:57.107 --> 00:52:58.742
BEFORE YOU PROCEED FORWARD.

00:52:58.808 --> 00:52:59.976
WE THINK AGAIN THAT HAS BASIC

00:53:00.043 --> 00:53:01.745
APPROACH IS PROMISING THAT YOU

00:53:01.811 --> 00:53:03.346
CAN GO AHEAD AND ENGAGE WITH HIM

00:53:03.413 --> 00:53:04.147
NOW THAT YOU KNOW THE

00:53:04.214 --> 00:53:05.649
ADMINISTRATION'S PRIORITIES YOU

00:53:05.715 --> 00:53:06.983
CAN SEE HOW WELL A LINE THEY ARE

00:53:07.050 --> 00:53:08.818
WITH YOUR OWN.

00:53:08.885 --> 00:53:10.320
WHEN IT COMES TO COMPENSATION

00:53:10.387 --> 00:53:12.188
YOU COULD ENCOURAGE THE SEGMENTS

00:53:12.255 --> 00:53:13.890
TO DO AS STAFFING ANALYSIS THAT

00:53:13.957 --> 00:53:15.158
WOULD LOOK AT RECRUITMENT AND

00:53:15.225 --> 00:53:16.593
RETENTION DATA AND THEN YOU

00:53:16.660 --> 00:53:18.094
COULD USE THE RESULTS AT LEAST

00:53:18.161 --> 00:53:19.362
NEXT YEAR TO INFORM THE

00:53:19.429 --> 00:53:20.897
DECISIONS YOU MAKE?

00:53:20.964 --> 00:53:22.265
MOST OF THE NINETEEN TWENTY

00:53:22.332 --> 00:53:24.267
CONTRACTS OF BARGAINING UNIT

00:53:24.334 --> 00:53:25.802
CONTRACTS HAVE ALREADY BEEN

00:53:25.869 --> 00:53:29.739
NEGOTIATED. FOR NINETEEN TWENTY

00:53:29.806 --> 00:53:31.274
ENROLLMENT TARGETS WE WOULD

00:53:31.341 --> 00:53:32.809
SUGGEST AT A MINIMUM YOU THINK

00:53:32.876 --> 00:53:33.877
ABOUT THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL

00:53:33.944 --> 00:53:36.947
GRADUATES SO DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS.

00:53:37.013 --> 00:53:38.715
THE ALIGNMENT OF THE EXISTING

00:53:38.782 --> 00:53:39.583
ENROLLMENT LEVELS WITH THE

00:53:39.649 --> 00:53:41.084
MASTER PLAN ELIGIBILITY PULLS

00:53:41.151 --> 00:53:42.419
THE NUMBER OF DENIED ALL DOUBLE

00:53:42.485 --> 00:53:44.054
STUDENTS THE NUMBER OF RE

00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:45.622
DIRECTED STUDENTS.

00:53:45.689 --> 00:53:47.057
THE FIRST TWO OF THESE FACTORS

00:53:47.123 --> 00:53:48.491
WOULD SUGGEST THAT THERE ISN'T A

00:53:48.558 --> 00:53:50.060
NEED FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH ON

00:53:50.126 --> 00:53:51.595
THE LATTER TWO FACTORS WOULD

00:53:51.661 --> 00:53:53.863
SUGGEST THAT THERE IS SOME.

00:53:53.930 --> 00:53:56.299
MERIT TO HAVE IN A ROMAN GROWTH.

00:53:56.366 --> 00:53:57.734
IF YOU DO DECIDE TO PROVIDE

00:53:57.801 --> 00:53:59.202
FUNDING FOR STUDENT IMPROVEMENT

00:53:59.269 --> 00:54:00.570
INITIATIVES WE JUST ENCOURAGE

00:54:00.637 --> 00:54:01.738
YOU TO LINK THE FUNDING WITH

00:54:01.805 --> 00:54:03.306
PERFORMANCE EXPECTATIONS SO YOU

00:54:03.373 --> 00:54:04.874
WOULD BE CLEAR ON WHAT YOU WANT

00:54:04.941 --> 00:54:06.543
WITH CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT.

00:54:06.610 --> 00:54:08.445
IN GRADUATION RATES NARROWING

00:54:08.511 --> 00:54:10.714
ACHIEVING GAPS REDUCTION AND

00:54:10.780 --> 00:54:13.116
ACCESS UNITS.

00:54:13.183 --> 00:54:14.751
TURNING TO THE LAST PAGE THEN

00:54:14.818 --> 00:54:16.119
THE STATE DOES HAVE A LONG

00:54:16.186 --> 00:54:18.254
STANDING TRADITION OF COVERING

00:54:18.321 --> 00:54:20.156
TUITION FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY

00:54:20.223 --> 00:54:21.992
STUDENTS AND COVERING BOOKS AND

00:54:22.058 --> 00:54:23.960
SUPPLIES FOR A SUBSET OF THE

00:54:24.027 --> 00:54:25.528
NEEDIEST FINANCIALLY NEEDY

00:54:25.595 --> 00:54:26.529
STUDENTS.

00:54:26.596 --> 00:54:28.398
BUT IT DOES NOT TO DATE HAVE A

00:54:28.465 --> 00:54:30.467
LARGE SCALE PROGRAM TO DEAL WITH

00:54:30.533 --> 00:54:32.335
LIVING COSTS.

00:54:32.402 --> 00:54:33.703
I'M SO BEFORE CREATING A NEW

00:54:33.770 --> 00:54:35.305
PROGRAM ESPECIALLY BEFORE

00:54:35.372 --> 00:54:36.640
CREATING A PROGRAM THAT MIGHT

00:54:36.706 --> 00:54:38.508
JUST OPERATE OUT ONE SEGMENT AS

00:54:38.575 --> 00:54:40.110
OPPOSED TO ALL OF THEM.

00:54:40.176 --> 00:54:41.411
WE THINK THERE'S A LOT MORE THAT

00:54:41.478 --> 00:54:42.712
THE STATE COULD LEARN.

00:54:42.779 --> 00:54:43.313
SO THE STATE COULD GATHER MORE

00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:46.716
AND INCIDENTS AN UNDERLYING

00:54:46.783 --> 00:54:48.218
CAUSES OF FOOD AND HOUSING AND

00:54:48.284 --> 00:54:49.552
SECURITY ACROSS ALL OF THE

00:54:49.619 --> 00:54:50.620
SEGMENTS.

00:54:50.687 --> 00:54:52.322
GET MORE RELIABLE INFORMATION ON

00:54:52.389 --> 00:54:54.257
COST OF ATTENDANCE ESPECIALLY

00:54:54.324 --> 00:54:55.692
FOR STUDENT PARENTS.

00:54:55.759 --> 00:54:57.127
UNDERSTAND THE INTERACTION OF

00:54:57.193 --> 00:54:58.662
STUDENT FINANCIALLY PROGRAMS

00:54:58.728 --> 00:55:00.664
WITH PUBLIC ASSISTANCE PROGRAMS

00:55:00.730 --> 00:55:02.032
UNDERSTAND THE TRADE OFFS

00:55:02.098 --> 00:55:03.366
INVOLVED IN PROVIDING MORE

00:55:03.433 --> 00:55:04.868
LIVING SUPPORT FOR COLLEGE

00:55:04.934 --> 00:55:06.302
STUDENTS VERSUS OTHER LOW INCOME

00:55:06.369 --> 00:55:07.437
FAMILIES.

00:55:07.504 --> 00:55:09.572
MEASURE UNMET NEED AND DECIDE

00:55:09.639 --> 00:55:10.640
HOW TO PRIORITIZE AVAILABLE

00:55:10.707 --> 00:55:12.475
FUNDS SO THERE'S A LOT TO BE

00:55:12.542 --> 00:55:14.344
UNPACKED WE THINK IN THIS AREA

00:55:14.411 --> 00:55:15.879
IT'S SIMILAR WITH MENTAL HEALTH.

00:55:15.945 --> 00:55:17.247
THE STATE COULD LEARN QUITE A

00:55:17.313 --> 00:55:18.548
BIT ABOUT WHAT ARE THE MENTAL

00:55:18.615 --> 00:55:20.116
HEALTH ISSUES ACROSS ALL OF THE

00:55:20.183 --> 00:55:23.186
SECTORS OF HIGHER EDUCATION. TO

00:55:23.253 --> 00:55:24.287
WHAT EXTENT ARE FOR SERVICES

00:55:24.354 --> 00:55:25.989
BEING PROVIDED ON CAMPUS OR OFF

00:55:26.056 --> 00:55:28.058
CAMPUS WHAT'S THE BENEFIT OF

00:55:28.124 --> 00:55:29.859
THAT MIX WHAT ARE THE EXISTING

00:55:29.926 --> 00:55:31.661
RESOURCES INCLUDING STUDENT

00:55:31.728 --> 00:55:33.329
FAMILY HEALTH PLANS TO COVER

00:55:33.396 --> 00:55:35.031
ASSOCIATED COSTS --

00:55:35.098 --> 00:55:36.332
AND WHAT OTHER FUNDING SOURCES

00:55:36.399 --> 00:55:39.069
ARE AVAILABLE.

00:55:39.135 --> 00:55:39.869
AGAIN WE THINK THE GOVERNOR'S

00:55:39.936 --> 00:55:41.738
CUP OUTLAY STRATEGY IS GENERALLY

00:55:41.805 --> 00:55:42.939
PROMISE SCENE --

00:55:43.006 --> 00:55:44.507
BUT THERE STILL ARE A FEW

00:55:44.574 --> 00:55:46.743
PROPOSALS PROJECTS THAT WE THINK

00:55:46.810 --> 00:55:48.878
ARE JUSTIFIED FOR EXAMPLE AS THE

00:55:48.945 --> 00:55:50.213
ISSUE THERE IS STILL A PROJECT

00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:51.481
THAT WOULD FIND NOT ONLY A

00:55:51.548 --> 00:55:53.283
RENOVATION OF THE THEATER BUT A

00:55:53.349 --> 00:55:54.417
SIDE BY SIDE THEATER.

00:55:54.484 --> 00:55:55.919
THIS JUST RAISE A CERTAIN ISSUES

00:55:55.985 --> 00:55:57.487
ABOUT YOUR PRIORITIES WHETHER

00:55:57.554 --> 00:55:58.054
YOU WOULD PREFER TO HAVE A

00:55:58.121 --> 00:55:59.656
SECOND THEATER ON A CAMPUS OR

00:55:59.723 --> 00:56:01.858
USE THAT ADDITIONAL RESOURCES

00:56:01.925 --> 00:56:04.594
FOR OTHER CAPITAL OUTLAY OR

00:56:04.661 --> 00:56:06.229
OTHER OPERATIONAL PURPOSES.

00:56:06.296 --> 00:56:07.163
AND I'M TUITION PREDICTABILITY

00:56:07.230 --> 00:56:08.798
WE THINK THE BEST WAY TO ENSURE

00:56:08.865 --> 00:56:10.867
THIS THIS WAS SERVICE AND SO WE

00:56:10.934 --> 00:56:12.302
WOULD CONTINUE AS WE SAID

00:56:12.368 --> 00:56:13.603
EARLIER HEARINGS TO ENCOURAGE

00:56:13.670 --> 00:56:15.004
YOU TO BUILD UP YOUR RESERVES

00:56:15.071 --> 00:56:16.740
THE EVEN HIGHER LEVELS THAN

00:56:16.806 --> 00:56:17.340
PROPOSED UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S

00:56:17.407 --> 00:56:19.375
BUDGET. ONE WAY TO DO THIS WOULD

00:56:19.442 --> 00:56:22.345
BE TO SHARE SOME OF THE COSTS IN

00:56:22.412 --> 00:56:23.246
NINETEEN TWENTY THESE COST

00:56:23.313 --> 00:56:24.247
INCREASES YOU'VE JUST HEARD

00:56:24.314 --> 00:56:26.216
ABOUT WITH NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY

00:56:26.282 --> 00:56:27.183
STUDENTS SO.

00:56:27.250 --> 00:56:28.251
FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS

00:56:28.318 --> 00:56:29.552
WILL NOT PAY THE COST INCREASES

00:56:29.619 --> 00:56:30.754
REGARDLESS.

00:56:30.820 --> 00:56:32.122
THE NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY

00:56:32.188 --> 00:56:33.757
STUDENTS RIGHT NOW IS YES YOU

00:56:33.823 --> 00:56:35.859
ARE PAYING ABOUT 23% OF THEIR

00:56:35.925 --> 00:56:37.494
COSTS THEIR EDUCATION COSTS

00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.295
UNDER THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET THAT

00:56:39.362 --> 00:56:41.097
GOES DOWN 221%.

00:56:41.164 --> 00:56:43.299
AT UC SINCE OUR PAINT NON NEEDY

00:56:43.366 --> 00:56:44.501
FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS ARE

00:56:44.567 --> 00:56:46.836
PAYING 13% AND THAT WILL GO DOWN

00:56:46.903 --> 00:56:48.805
212% IS LOWER AT YOU SEE BECAUSE

00:56:48.872 --> 00:56:50.106
THEY HAVE FAR GREATER RESOURCES

00:56:50.173 --> 00:56:51.808
FROM NON RESIDENT STUDENTS THAT

00:56:51.875 --> 00:56:53.109
ARE EFFECTIVELY CROSS

00:56:53.176 --> 00:56:55.011
SUBSIDIZING RESIDENT STUDENTS.

00:56:55.078 --> 00:56:57.914
BUT ONE WAY TO THINK ABOUT THAN

00:56:57.981 --> 00:57:01.751
GETTING RESERVE TO THE STUDENTS

00:57:01.818 --> 00:57:03.286
DIRECT MORE INTO YOUR RESERVES

00:57:03.353 --> 00:57:05.221
YOU CAN ALSO HAVE A SHARE OF

00:57:05.288 --> 00:57:06.823
COSTS POLICY MOVING FORWARD.

00:57:06.890 --> 00:57:07.857
WHEREAS RESERVES ARE THE BEST

00:57:07.924 --> 00:57:09.359
WAY TO PROMOTE TUITION

00:57:09.425 --> 00:57:10.827
PREDICTABILITY HUMMING A SURE OF

00:57:10.894 --> 00:57:12.395
COST IS THE BEST WAY TO SEND

00:57:12.462 --> 00:57:14.130
SIGNALS TO NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY

00:57:14.197 --> 00:57:15.064
STUDENTS ABOUT THEIR

00:57:15.131 --> 00:57:16.332
EXPECTATIONS.

00:57:16.399 --> 00:57:17.734
SO WHETHER THESE NON FINANCIALLY

00:57:17.801 --> 00:57:19.335
NEEDY STUDENTS THEIR FAMILIES

00:57:19.402 --> 00:57:20.403
THEY ENTER COLLEGE DURING A

00:57:20.470 --> 00:57:22.038
RECESSION OR RECOVERY THEY WOULD

00:57:22.105 --> 00:57:23.840
KNOW YOUR EXPECTATION AS TO WHAT

00:57:23.907 --> 00:57:25.608
SHARE OF THE EDUCATION COSTS

00:57:25.675 --> 00:57:26.309
THEY SHOULD COVER IS IT A

00:57:26.376 --> 00:57:27.277
QUARTER.

00:57:27.343 --> 00:57:29.012
IS IT HALF WHATEVER YOU MIGHT

00:57:29.078 --> 00:57:29.979
CHOOSE IT TO BE.

00:57:30.046 --> 00:57:31.147
SO I'D BE HAPPY TO ANSWER ANY

00:57:31.214 --> 00:57:35.285
QUESTIONS.

00:57:35.351 --> 00:57:37.453
OKAY THANK YOU ALL OF A FEW

00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:39.088
BUTTONS FIRST OPEN UP TO

00:57:39.155 --> 00:57:42.492
COMMITTEE MEMBERS.

00:57:42.559 --> 00:57:45.094
SO YOU MENTIONED --

00:57:45.161 --> 00:57:46.763
THE PRIORITIES OF THE

00:57:46.830 --> 00:57:48.665
LEGISLATURE. ONE BEING

00:57:48.731 --> 00:57:50.233
ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

00:57:50.300 --> 00:57:52.235
AND SO ONE OF THAT THE NUANCES

00:57:52.302 --> 00:57:53.503
OF THIS BUDGET AS I SAID THE

00:57:53.570 --> 00:57:54.971
OPENING.

00:57:55.038 --> 00:57:56.773
THE GOVERNOR HAS AT THE MAZING

00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.441
BUDGET HE SPENT FIFTEEN MINUTES

00:57:58.508 --> 00:58:00.310
TALKING ABOUT USUALLY WE'RE HERE

00:58:00.376 --> 00:58:01.444
FOR LIKE NINETY SECONDS TALKING

00:58:01.511 --> 00:58:03.880
ABOUT GOVERNOR BROWN'S JANUARY

00:58:03.947 --> 00:58:04.447
BUDGET.

00:58:04.514 --> 00:58:06.482
SO WE HAD FOUR MONTHS TO FOCUS

00:58:06.549 --> 00:58:08.117
ON OUR PRIORITIES.

00:58:08.184 --> 00:58:11.421
AND SO GET OUT PARK OUT FOR A

00:58:11.487 --> 00:58:13.256
SECOND THEN THE FACT THAT THE

00:58:13.323 --> 00:58:14.824
REVENUES COMING IN RIGHT NOW.

00:58:14.891 --> 00:58:16.359
MAY NOT LOOK LIKE THAT MAY

00:58:16.426 --> 00:58:18.294
REVISED WE'VE HAD THE LAST FIVE

00:58:18.361 --> 00:58:20.029
YEARS WE'VE HAD.

00:58:20.096 --> 00:58:20.897
OPPORTUNITY IN MAY TO DO

00:58:20.964 --> 00:58:23.533
SIGNIFICANT GOVERNOR INITIATIVES

00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:24.601
IN LET'S SAY MISTER DEEDS ON

00:58:24.667 --> 00:58:26.102
THESE POLICY AREAS SO.

00:58:26.169 --> 00:58:28.171
IF IF THERE WAS A DESIRE FOR

00:58:28.238 --> 00:58:29.873
EXAMPLE TO PUSH FORWARD ON

00:58:29.939 --> 00:58:32.208
ENROLLMENT GROWTH FOR YOU SEE

00:58:32.275 --> 00:58:33.009
CSU.

00:58:33.076 --> 00:58:35.411
AND THERE'S NOT ADDITIONAL

00:58:35.478 --> 00:58:36.713
REVENUES ARE ARE THERE.

00:58:36.779 --> 00:58:38.348
ARE THERE --

00:58:38.414 --> 00:58:39.382
PROGRAMS ARE ARE --

00:58:39.449 --> 00:58:40.350
PROPOSALS IN THE GOVERNOR'S

00:58:40.416 --> 00:58:43.386
JANUARY BUDGET WHICH YOU THINK.

00:58:43.453 --> 00:58:44.320
DON'T -- IT

00:58:44.387 --> 00:58:47.891
HAVE THE EVIDENCE TO BACK UP --

00:58:47.957 --> 00:58:49.092
AND THAT WE SHOULD CONSIDER BUT

00:58:49.158 --> 00:58:50.426
THAT'S LOOKING AT THOSE IF WE

00:58:50.493 --> 00:58:50.927
WANT TO FOCUS ON OTHER

00:58:50.994 --> 00:58:51.995
PRIORITIES.

00:58:52.061 --> 00:58:55.131
LIKE ENROLLMENT GROWTH YES THERE --

00:58:55.198 --> 00:58:56.866
THEY'RE TOUGH DECISIONS AND OUT

00:58:56.933 --> 00:58:58.601
FOR YOU TO MAKE SO WE HAVE FOUND

00:58:58.668 --> 00:59:00.670
SOME PROPOSALS THAT WE THINK YOU

00:59:00.737 --> 00:59:02.171
MIGHT WANT TO REVISIT.

00:59:02.238 --> 00:59:03.539
BUT THEY'RE GONNA SOUND LIKE

00:59:03.606 --> 00:59:04.807
VERY DIFFICULT TRADE OFFS FOR

00:59:04.874 --> 00:59:05.508
YOU -- SO

00:59:05.575 --> 00:59:07.210
FOR EXAMPLE PROVIDING A NEW CAL

00:59:07.277 --> 00:59:09.679
GRANT JUST FOR STUDENT PARENTS.

00:59:09.746 --> 00:59:11.147
WE THINK IS ADDING EVEN MORE

00:59:11.214 --> 00:59:14.584
COMPLEX STEM NOW WE HAVE AGAIN

00:59:14.651 --> 00:59:16.953
SPECIAL CAL GRANT ACCESS AWARDS

THAT'S A HUNDRED AND TWENTY FIVE

00:59:19.956 --> 00:59:21.090
MILLION A HUNDRED AND TWENTY TWO

00:59:21.157 --> 00:59:23.693
MILLION DOLLARS --

00:59:23.760 --> 00:59:25.295
THERE YOU SEE MENTAL HEALTH

00:59:25.361 --> 00:59:27.397
ONGOING RESOURCES --

00:59:27.463 --> 00:59:29.632
YOU MIGHT ALSO JUST STOP NOT

00:59:29.699 --> 00:59:31.200
NECESSARILY NOT DO SOMETHING FOR

00:59:31.267 --> 00:59:32.602
THE FUTURE BUT FIGURE SOME

00:59:32.669 --> 00:59:34.637
THINGS OUT BEFORE YOU WOULD

00:59:34.704 --> 00:59:36.105
SPEND THAT MONEY THIS YEAR --

00:59:36.172 --> 00:59:39.275
I THINK ALL TOTAL ACROSS OUR NON

00:59:39.342 --> 00:59:40.443
NINETY EIGHT EDUCATION BUDGET SO

00:59:40.510 --> 00:59:41.978
EVEN INCLUDING SOME THINGS WE

00:59:42.045 --> 00:59:43.680
SAY ON THE EARLY ADD SIDE WE DO

00:59:43.746 --> 00:59:45.548
HAVE SOMETHING LIKE TWO HUNDRED

00:59:45.615 --> 00:59:46.649
AND THIRTY SOME MILLION DOLLARS

00:59:46.716 --> 00:59:48.551
YOU COULD CONSIDER REPURPOSE

00:59:48.618 --> 00:59:50.086
SCENE FOR ONGOING SPENDING.

00:59:50.153 --> 00:59:51.521
THERE'S ALSO SOME THINGS ON THE

00:59:51.587 --> 00:59:53.222
ONE TIME AFFRONT TO WHERE WE

00:59:53.289 --> 00:59:54.624
THINK YOU MIGHT CONSIDER

00:59:54.691 --> 00:59:55.992
REPURPOSE IN THOSE --

00:59:56.059 --> 00:59:57.060
BUT YOU TALKED A LITTLE BIT

00:59:57.126 --> 00:59:58.528
ABOUT THAT YESTERDAY LIKE THIS

00:59:58.594 --> 00:59:59.996
KINDERGARTEN FACILITY GRANT'S

01:00:00.063 --> 01:00:01.064
INTEREST AND STILL DOING

01:00:01.130 --> 01:00:02.365
SOMETHING BUT IT IS A LARGE

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.933
AMOUNT OF MONEY SEVEN HUNDRED

01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.501
AND FIFTY MILLION DOLLARS THAT

01:00:05.568 --> 01:00:06.803
YOU COULD USE IN A VARIETY OF

01:00:06.869 --> 01:00:09.038
WAYS. TO BUILD YOUR BUDGET

01:00:09.105 --> 01:00:11.774
PACKAGE.

01:00:11.841 --> 01:00:14.243
SO. ONE ISSUE THAT WAS SOMEONE

01:00:14.310 --> 01:00:15.511
REYES AND BELIEVE BY YOU IS IN

01:00:15.578 --> 01:00:17.547
THE UC ALLOCATION FOR THE TWO

01:00:17.613 --> 01:00:20.450
FORTY THERE IS THE FIFTY MILLION.

01:00:20.516 --> 01:00:21.451
FOR GRADUATION [inaudible]

01:00:21.517 --> 01:00:23.519
INITIATIVE AND WE'VE HEARD A LOT

01:00:23.586 --> 01:00:26.422
ABOUT GRAD INITIATIVES BUT IT

01:00:26.489 --> 01:00:27.724
HASN'T REALLY BEEN UC.

01:00:27.790 --> 01:00:30.026
IT'S BEEN THE CSU CONVERSATION.

01:00:30.093 --> 01:00:31.861
SO IS THAT.

01:00:31.928 --> 01:00:33.029
YEAH I'M SORRY THAT THAT'S

01:00:33.096 --> 01:00:34.430
ANOTHER GREAT POINT THAT WE GO

01:00:34.497 --> 01:00:36.065
OVER IN MORE DETAIL IN OUR

01:00:36.132 --> 01:00:37.633
REPORT YEAH OUT OF LEAD THE KEY

01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:39.802
ISSUES WITH YOU SEE HAVE TENDED

01:00:39.869 --> 01:00:41.904
TO BE COST RELATED --

01:00:41.971 --> 01:00:43.172
AS OPPOSED TO LIKE SAME KINDS OF

01:00:43.239 --> 01:00:44.173
ISSUES WITH THE COMMUNITY

01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:46.542
COLLEGES AND CSU TRYING TO

01:00:46.609 --> 01:00:48.211
IMPROVE DEGREE COMPLETION YOU

01:00:48.277 --> 01:00:49.979
SEE ON A LONG STANDING BASIS HAS

01:00:50.046 --> 01:00:51.581
HAD THE HIGHEST GRADUATIONRATES

01:00:51.647 --> 01:00:53.082
AMONG THE STATE MONTHS.

01:00:53.149 --> 01:00:54.283
THEIR SIX YEAR RATE ISN'T LIKE

01:00:54.350 --> 01:00:55.852
THE HIGH EIGHTIES SO MOST

01:00:55.918 --> 01:00:58.921
STUDENTS WHO GO TO UC COMPLETE --

01:00:58.988 --> 01:01:00.223
SO IF YOU WANTED TO AGAIN YOU

01:01:00.289 --> 01:01:01.257
MIGHT THINK THAT THAT WOULD BE

01:01:01.324 --> 01:01:02.692
BETTER SERVED BY HAVING

01:01:02.759 --> 01:01:03.960
ADDITIONAL STUDENTS THAT IS

01:01:04.027 --> 01:01:05.428
ONGOING MONEY IT WOULD BE

01:01:05.495 --> 01:01:08.031
APPROPRIATE FOR ANOTHER LARGER

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:09.465
ONGOING COOL CORD OUT YOU SEE OR

01:01:09.532 --> 01:01:11.701
ANY OTHER HIGHER ADD OR NON

01:01:11.768 --> 01:01:14.737
NINETY EIGHT BUDGET PRIORITY

01:01:14.804 --> 01:01:16.639
THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE.

01:01:16.706 --> 01:01:17.507
OKAY I THINK AND THEN LASTLY YOU

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:18.875
YOU TALKED ABOUT THE TUITION

01:01:18.941 --> 01:01:19.776
POLICY.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:21.344
I KNOW IN YEARS PAST THERE'S

01:01:21.411 --> 01:01:22.078
BEEN IN.

01:01:22.145 --> 01:01:25.248
CONTACT WHAT HAVE YOU BETWEEN.

01:01:25.314 --> 01:01:26.349
GOVERNOR'S AND THAT YOU SEE IN

01:01:26.416 --> 01:01:27.583
CSU SEGMENTS AND THAT A PIECE OF

01:01:27.650 --> 01:01:30.086
THAT IS A TUITION POLICY AND

01:01:30.153 --> 01:01:32.121
WHEN YOU'RE PROPOSALS HERE IS IS

01:01:32.188 --> 01:01:33.356
LOOKING AT THEM.

01:01:33.423 --> 01:01:38.694
THE NON NEEDY STUDENTS AND THEIR

01:01:38.761 --> 01:01:39.562
I'M NOT SURE WHAT YOU'RE SAYING

01:01:39.629 --> 01:01:40.196
THERE IS THAT THE YOU WOULD HAVE

01:01:40.263 --> 01:01:42.265
IT.

01:01:42.331 --> 01:01:46.002
FOR PEOPLE AT THE EXTREME AS FAR

01:01:46.069 --> 01:01:48.471
AS INCOME AND THEY HAVE.

01:01:48.538 --> 01:01:51.707
IT WILL BE AT THE AT KIND OF A

01:01:51.774 --> 01:01:52.341
NO I'M SORRY I MIGHT HAVE JUST

01:01:52.408 --> 01:01:54.277
GONE TOO QUICKLY BECAUSE THE CAL

01:01:54.343 --> 01:01:56.746
GRANT COVERS THE TUITION LEVEL

01:01:56.813 --> 01:01:58.247
WHATEVER IT IS THAT YOU SEE ARE

01:01:58.314 --> 01:02:00.149
CSU AND THE BOND DOES THE SAME

01:02:00.216 --> 01:02:01.417
AT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGES.

01:02:01.484 --> 01:02:03.653
SO WHATEVER THE TUITION LEVEL IS

01:02:03.719 --> 01:02:05.455
THE STATE CALIFORNIA COVERS AT

01:02:05.521 --> 01:02:07.390
FOR FINANCIALLY NEEDY STUDENTS

01:02:07.457 --> 01:02:08.624
IN EASTERN FILLS UP A FAST AND

01:02:08.691 --> 01:02:09.058
HAS.

01:02:09.125 --> 01:02:10.827
A MINIMUM LEVEL OF NEED THE

01:02:10.893 --> 01:02:12.462
STATE COVERS ARE TUITION COSTS

01:02:12.528 --> 01:02:14.030
SO THE ONLY STUDENTS EFFECTIVELY

01:02:14.097 --> 01:02:15.765
PAYING THE TUITION CHARGE AT THE

01:02:15.832 --> 01:02:17.967
SEGMENTS ARE NON NEEDY STUDENTS

01:02:18.034 --> 01:02:19.635
AND WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE LIKE.

01:02:19.702 --> 01:02:21.404
TWO THIRDS OF COMMUNITY COLLEGE

01:02:21.471 --> 01:02:23.306
UNITS ARE WAIVED SO THERE'S A

01:02:23.372 --> 01:02:24.974
CHUNK OF STUDENTS STILL BUT A

01:02:25.041 --> 01:02:26.442
RELATIVELY SMALL STUDENT SHARE

01:02:26.509 --> 01:02:28.744
STUDENTS ARE PAYING THE FEE.

01:02:28.811 --> 01:02:30.046
AND THOSE WHO ARE ARE YOUR ARM.

01:02:30.113 --> 01:02:32.949
MORE MIDDLE INCOME FOLKS AND SO

01:02:33.015 --> 01:02:35.551
I I APPRECIATE IT IS A COST ON

01:02:35.618 --> 01:02:36.352
THESE MIDDLE INCOME AND UPPER

01:02:36.419 --> 01:02:39.689
INCOME FAMILIES BUT IF YOU GET

01:02:39.755 --> 01:02:41.424
TO HAVE A LARGER RESERVE OR MORE

01:02:41.491 --> 01:02:43.025
ENROLLMENT GROWTH.

01:02:43.092 --> 01:02:44.660
THESE ARE KEY TRADE OFFS FOR YOU

01:02:44.727 --> 01:02:46.295
TO CONSIDER --

01:02:46.362 --> 01:02:47.597
THE CULTURE OF COSTS THAT NON

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:49.365
NEEDY STUDENTS RIGHT NOW THOSE

01:02:49.432 --> 01:02:51.100
WHO ARE PAYING THE CHARGE THE

01:02:51.167 --> 01:02:52.802
SHARE OF THEIR EDUCATION COST IS

01:02:52.869 --> 01:02:54.303
IS STILL HEAVILY SUBSIDIZED

01:02:54.370 --> 01:02:56.539
STRIKE POLICY CALIFORNIA IS

01:02:56.606 --> 01:02:57.106
PAYING.

01:02:57.173 --> 01:03:00.343
A 77% OF THE COST OF EDUCATION

01:03:00.409 --> 01:03:02.245
FOR THESE NON FINANCIALLY NEEDY

01:03:02.311 --> 01:03:06.315
STUDENTS AT CSU ALMOST 90% AT UC --

01:03:06.382 --> 01:03:07.683
COMBINED WITH ACTUALLY THE STATE

01:03:07.750 --> 01:03:09.218
OF CALIFORNIA AND NON RESIDENTS

01:03:09.285 --> 01:03:11.187
FOR YOU SEE SO WE WOULD JUST

01:03:11.254 --> 01:03:12.355
SUGGEST THAT THESE ARE REALLY

01:03:12.421 --> 01:03:13.422
IMPORTANT TRADE OFFS FOR YOU TO

01:03:13.489 --> 01:03:14.524
CONSIDER.

01:03:14.590 --> 01:03:22.064
IT WOULD IT BE SUCH A TO AT THE

01:03:22.131 --> 01:03:24.734
SHARE THEIR PAIN TODAY AT 23% OF

01:03:24.800 --> 01:03:26.002
THOUGHTS TO SHARE YOU THINK AS

01:03:26.068 --> 01:03:27.970
REASONABLE AS OPPOSED TO HAVING

01:03:28.037 --> 01:03:30.506
FEES FLAK FOR SEVEN EIGHT NINE

01:03:30.573 --> 01:03:32.508
YEARS AND HAVING THEIR SHARE

01:03:32.575 --> 01:03:34.977
JUST IMPLICITLY GO DOWN.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.212
YEAH I UNDERSTAND THAT BUT I BUT

01:03:36.279 --> 01:03:37.413
I GUESS I'M I'M INTRIGUED BY

01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:38.781
THIS BECAUSE I THINK THAT'S ONE

01:03:38.848 --> 01:03:40.483
THING THAT'S LACKING IS WE DON'T

01:03:40.550 --> 01:03:41.517
HAVE.

01:03:41.584 --> 01:03:43.920
RESOURCES FOR ENROLLMENT GROWTH

01:03:43.986 --> 01:03:47.323
AND I KNOW THAT THE YOU SEE --

01:03:47.390 --> 01:03:48.858
AND SEE THIS YEAR AND TALK ABOUT

01:03:48.925 --> 01:03:49.892
THIS A LITTLE BIT.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:52.061
SO THE CURRENT TUITION FOR

01:03:52.128 --> 01:03:54.363
EXAMPLE FOR UC'S ROUGHLY TWELVE

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.264
THOUSAND DOLLARS.

01:03:55.331 --> 01:03:57.500
SO IF YOUR HEY UPPER INCOME YOU

01:03:57.567 --> 01:03:59.435
SEE FAMILY AND THOSE FAMILIES

01:03:59.502 --> 01:04:00.536
ARE PROBABLY SAY HEY WE PAY A

01:04:00.603 --> 01:04:02.772
LOT IN OUR TAXES AND SO FORTH

01:04:02.838 --> 01:04:04.073
THAT'S THAT'S OUR SHARE BUT

01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:06.042
PARKING THAT FOR A SECOND.

01:04:06.108 --> 01:04:09.245
WOULD YOU HAVE IN THAT IT AT

01:04:09.312 --> 01:04:10.846
TUITION BASED UPON.

01:04:10.913 --> 01:04:12.548
AN INCOME.

01:04:12.615 --> 01:04:14.717
SO IF YOU MAKE FAMILY OVER TO

01:04:14.784 --> 01:04:16.052
ONE FIFTY GRAND YOU PAY X.

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:17.186
TUITION AND THEN.

01:04:17.253 --> 01:04:18.654
RATCHET DOWN OR UP HOW

01:04:18.721 --> 01:04:20.122
LOGISTICALLY WOULD YOU DO THAT

01:04:20.189 --> 01:04:21.824
I'M SORRY WE IMAGINED IT WOULD

01:04:21.891 --> 01:04:23.559
BE VERY STRAIGHTFORWARD SO IF

01:04:23.626 --> 01:04:25.828
YOU DECIDED TO APPROVE CERTAIN

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:27.096
THINGS AND UC'S BUDGET SAY YOU

01:04:27.163 --> 01:04:28.798
DECIDED TO INCREASE AT THREE

01:04:28.864 --> 01:04:29.932
HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS.

01:04:29.999 --> 01:04:32.301
AND IT TURNED OUT TO BE A 3%

01:04:32.368 --> 01:04:33.970
INCREASE TO THEIR CORE BUDGET

01:04:34.036 --> 01:04:35.271
YOU WOULD JUST SHARE IT BETWEEN

01:04:35.338 --> 01:04:37.273
THE STATE AND NON NEEDY STUDENTS

01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:39.475
SO EVERYBODY SHARE WOULD GO AT

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:40.176
3%.

01:04:40.243 --> 01:04:41.711
YEAH BUT BUT HOW WILL THAT

01:04:41.777 --> 01:04:44.046
MANIFEST TO THAT FAMILY PAYING

01:04:44.113 --> 01:04:45.381
THEIR TUITION BILL.

01:04:45.448 --> 01:04:46.749
IT WOULD GO UP 3%. FOR ALL

01:04:46.816 --> 01:04:48.317
STUDENTS WHO CURRENTLY PAY THE

01:04:48.384 --> 01:04:50.720
FEE THEY WOULD PAY 3% MORE NEXT

01:04:50.786 --> 01:04:52.321
YEAR NOT BASED UPON WHERE YOU'RE

01:04:52.388 --> 01:04:53.556
AT IN THE INCOME SKIN NOW WE

01:04:53.623 --> 01:04:55.691
WEREN'T IMAGINING ANYTHING THAT

01:04:55.758 --> 01:04:56.626
COMPLEX.

01:04:56.692 --> 01:04:57.693
THIS IS A CLEAR FILE IS BUT THAT

01:04:57.760 --> 01:04:59.395
WOULD MEAN A TUITION INCREASE

01:04:59.462 --> 01:05:04.200
RIGHT EXACTLY YES BAXTER KEY

01:05:04.267 --> 01:05:05.735
FACTOR THAT YOUR KEY TRADE OFF.

01:05:05.801 --> 01:05:07.436
WHETHER YOU WANT TO ASSESS NON

01:05:07.503 --> 01:05:08.204
NEEDY FINANCIALLY STE NEEDY

01:05:08.271 --> 01:05:08.771
STUDENTS A TUITION INCREASE

01:05:08.838 --> 01:05:09.372
SOMEWHERE ON THE MAGNITUDE OF

01:05:09.438 --> 01:05:10.873
INFLATION OR WHATEVER ELSE YOU

01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:12.408
DECIDE --

01:05:12.475 --> 01:05:13.876
AND AGAIN IT TO DO THAT

01:05:13.943 --> 01:05:15.544
EFFECTIVELY MEANS JUST WHATEVER

01:05:15.611 --> 01:05:17.213
NON NEEDY FINANCIALLY NEEDY

01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:18.281
STUDENTS WERE PAIN AS A SHARE OF

01:05:18.347 --> 01:05:19.949
COSTS IS JUST REMAINING STUDY

01:05:20.016 --> 01:05:22.251
OVER TIME ON ON YOU ARE TREATING

01:05:22.318 --> 01:05:24.220
THEM SIMILARLY IT TO LAST YEAR

01:05:24.287 --> 01:05:25.721
IT'S JUST COSTS HAVE GONE UP AND

01:05:25.788 --> 01:05:28.758
SO EVERYBODY'S PAYING A LITTLE.

01:05:28.824 --> 01:05:30.092
BIT MORE TO COVER THOSE COSTS.

01:05:30.159 --> 01:05:31.294
OKAY YET I THINK YOU SAID THE

01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:32.928
KEY WORD IT'S A TRADE OFF YOU

01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:32.321
FOUR POINT.

01:11:32.388 --> 01:11:33.756
TWO OKAY BUT EITHER WAY --

01:11:33.822 --> 01:11:35.624
I JUST SO I WONDER WHY THEY

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:36.992
WOULD NEED THAT MONEY GIVEN THAT

01:11:37.059 --> 01:11:39.428
THAT'S A PRETTY IF IF IN FACT

01:11:39.495 --> 01:11:40.929
THAT NUMBER THAT I'VE SPEWED OUT.

01:11:40.996 --> 01:11:42.631
AND DIDN'T MAKE UP I BELIEVE --

01:11:42.698 --> 01:11:44.333
IS TRUE I WOULD JUST WONDER WHY

01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.035
THEY WOULD NEED THAT MUCH THANK

01:11:46.101 --> 01:11:47.269
YOU SEE WILL COVER THIS AND MUCH

01:11:47.336 --> 01:11:49.171
MORE IN DEPTH BUT THEY DO HAVE

01:11:49.238 --> 01:11:50.739
DIFFERENCES IN GRADUATION RATES

01:11:50.806 --> 01:11:52.775
ACROSS CAMPUSES AND ACROSS

01:11:52.841 --> 01:11:54.810
ETHNIC GROUPS SO IF THEY WERE TO

01:11:54.877 --> 01:11:56.378
USE IT ON UNDERGRADUATES THE KEY

01:11:56.445 --> 01:11:57.179
ISSUE BEFORE YOU.

01:11:57.246 --> 01:11:58.947
AS IN THE WHOLE SCHEME OF YOUR

01:11:59.014 --> 01:12:00.616
BUDGET HOW CONCERNED ARE YOU

01:12:00.683 --> 01:12:02.518
ABOUT THOSE DIFFERENCES FORCES

01:12:02.584 --> 01:12:04.687
OTHER ENROLLMENT GROWTH OR ANY

01:12:04.753 --> 01:12:05.587
OTHER PRIORITIES YOU MIGHT

01:12:05.654 --> 01:12:05.821
HEALTH.

01:12:05.888 --> 01:12:07.256
CARE AND I WAS LOOK FOR SOME

01:12:07.322 --> 01:12:08.057
DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THOSE

01:12:08.123 --> 01:12:09.925
DIFFERENCES SO THEY CAN BE MORE

01:12:09.992 --> 01:12:11.493
CONSPICUOUS WITH THAT BACK YOU

01:12:11.560 --> 01:12:12.528
MISTER YEAH AND I THINK YOU

01:12:12.594 --> 01:12:13.962
RAISE A GREAT POINT MR O'DONNELL

01:12:14.029 --> 01:12:15.731
IS THAT IF WE'RE LOOKING AT

01:12:15.798 --> 01:12:16.765
TRYING TO REALLY.

01:12:16.832 --> 01:12:18.600
EXPAND ENROLLMENT.

01:12:18.667 --> 01:12:20.669
AND BIRD DON'T WANT TO GO DOWN A

01:12:20.736 --> 01:12:21.904
TUITION WE'RE NOT GONNA TAKE

01:12:21.970 --> 01:12:23.639
MONEY AWAY FROM.

01:12:23.706 --> 01:12:26.275
OTHER PROGRAMS THE STATE BUDGET.

01:12:26.341 --> 01:12:29.411
THIS IS SO MAKES SENSE TO HELP

01:12:29.478 --> 01:12:31.080
STUDENTS AT UC ALREADY GRADUATE

01:12:31.146 --> 01:12:33.082
AVERAGING FOUR POINT THREE YEARS.

01:12:33.148 --> 01:12:34.683
THE COULD USE SOME OF THAT TO

01:12:34.750 --> 01:12:36.285
EXPAND A ROMAN GROWTH AND THEN

01:12:36.351 --> 01:12:37.953
TAKE A LOOK AT A MORE NUANCED A

01:12:38.020 --> 01:12:38.620
GREAT POINT BUT JUST ONE COMMENT

01:12:38.687 --> 01:12:39.188
ON THAT.

01:12:39.254 --> 01:12:43.325
I THINK OUR MISSION SHOULDN'T BE.

01:12:43.392 --> 01:12:44.026
JUST TO EXPAND ENROLLMENT.

01:12:44.093 --> 01:12:45.060
MISSION SHOULD BE TO SERVE THE

01:12:45.127 --> 01:12:47.062
STUDENTS.

01:12:47.129 --> 01:12:48.664
THAT ARE CURRENTLY ENROLLED.

01:12:48.731 --> 01:12:51.834
BEFORE WE EXPAND IN ROME.

01:12:51.900 --> 01:12:54.169
OKAY SO WITH THAT LET'S BRING UP

01:12:54.236 --> 01:12:55.904
OUR OF MISTER GALLAGHER.

01:12:55.971 --> 01:12:57.706
SO ONE I I DO SHARE SOME OF

01:12:57.773 --> 01:13:00.275
THOSE CONCERNS IS THE REGARDING

01:13:00.342 --> 01:13:02.044
THE TUITION INCREASE --

01:13:02.111 --> 01:13:04.146
BUT ALSO WITH THE FIFTEEN

01:13:04.213 --> 01:13:05.881
MILLION --

01:13:05.948 --> 01:13:07.182
FOR IN THE GRADUATION RATES YOU

01:13:07.249 --> 01:13:08.684
KNOW I I WANT TO HEAR MORE ABOUT

01:13:08.751 --> 01:13:09.651
LIKE WILL.

01:13:09.718 --> 01:13:10.753
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO WITH THAT

01:13:10.819 --> 01:13:12.721
MONEY AND WHAT YOUR PLAN WHAT'S

01:13:12.788 --> 01:13:14.189
YOUR PLAN WITH THAT MONEY IN AT

01:13:14.256 --> 01:13:15.424
LEAST FROM THE YOU SEE THAT'S

01:13:15.491 --> 01:13:16.191
ONE THING I'LL BE LOOKING TO

01:13:16.258 --> 01:13:17.926
HEAR?

01:13:17.993 --> 01:13:19.228
FROM AND REALLY WHEN WE'RE SEEN.

01:13:19.294 --> 01:13:23.565
SOME I THINK SOME GOOD PERFORMER

01:13:23.632 --> 01:13:24.833
WITH THE MONEY THEIR USE IN.

01:13:24.900 --> 01:13:27.836
TO YOUR BETTER GRADUATION RATES --

01:13:27.903 --> 01:13:30.405
AND YEAH I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE

01:13:30.472 --> 01:13:32.307
PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE YOU SEE

01:13:32.374 --> 01:13:32.975
IN.

01:13:33.041 --> 01:13:34.810
WE ALSO AND ON THE ENROLLMENT

01:13:34.877 --> 01:13:36.678
FRONT WE STILL DON'T KNOW.

01:13:36.745 --> 01:13:38.180
AS FAR AS I KNOW WHAT THEIR

01:13:38.247 --> 01:13:39.882
CAPACITY IS BECAUSE THAT

01:13:39.948 --> 01:13:41.483
INFORMATION AS A MAN CHAIR BUT

01:13:41.550 --> 01:13:44.486
THIS AS FAR AS I KNOW --

01:13:44.553 --> 01:13:46.355
BUT ONE THING I WANTED TO KEY IN

01:13:46.421 --> 01:13:47.189
ON FROM THE LA --

01:13:47.256 --> 01:13:49.625
IS ANOTHER WAY OF LOOKING OF

01:13:49.691 --> 01:13:52.261
TRYING TO DEAL WITH THE

01:13:52.327 --> 01:13:53.695
ENROLLMENT GROWTH ISSUE IS TO

01:13:53.762 --> 01:13:55.564
ACTUALLY LOOK TO NEXT YEAR AND

01:13:55.631 --> 01:13:58.901
SET A CAP ON ON THAT FUNDING.

01:13:58.967 --> 01:14:00.369
RATHER THAN PAYING AT THE NEXT

01:14:00.435 --> 01:14:01.203
YEAR LET'S LOOK INTO THE NEXT

01:14:01.270 --> 01:14:02.404
BUDGET YEAR AND SAY HEY HERE'S

01:14:02.471 --> 01:14:03.972
YOUR NUMBER.

01:14:04.039 --> 01:14:05.040
AND YOU'VE GOT TO STAY WITHIN

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:06.408
THAT NUMBER.

01:14:06.475 --> 01:14:08.310
RIGHT I MEAN AND AND TO ME THAT

01:14:08.377 --> 01:14:09.678
SEEMS LIKE.

01:14:09.745 --> 01:14:11.013
A POTENTIAL WAY TO REALLY STAY

01:14:11.079 --> 01:14:12.648
ON TRACK AND STAY ON TRACK

01:14:12.714 --> 01:14:14.983
FINANCIALLY --

01:14:15.050 --> 01:14:16.018
FUNDING WISE RATHER THAN TO SIT

01:14:16.084 --> 01:14:17.920
WITH THEM TO JUST KIND OF GOING

01:14:17.986 --> 01:14:18.887
TO THE NEXT YEAR BLINDLY AND

01:14:18.954 --> 01:14:19.922
THEN JUST.

01:14:19.988 --> 01:14:20.556
AS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE GUESTS DO

01:14:20.622 --> 01:14:21.690
NOW.

01:14:21.757 --> 01:14:24.226
PAY WHATEVER IT WAS --

01:14:24.293 --> 01:14:25.594
YOU KNOW TO ME CAN YOU MAYBE

01:14:25.661 --> 01:14:26.862
SPEAK TO THAT A LITTLE BIT SO IT

01:14:26.929 --> 01:14:27.796
SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE MAKING THAT

01:14:27.863 --> 01:14:29.565
RECOMMENDATION AS AS MAY BE

01:14:29.631 --> 01:14:31.166
SOMETHING WE COULD DO.

01:14:31.233 --> 01:14:32.801
SOMETHING THE LEGISLATURE HAS

01:14:32.868 --> 01:14:34.469
STARTED DOING SO IT AS IF I

01:14:34.536 --> 01:14:35.971
RECALL THE EXACT YEARS CORRECTLY

01:14:36.038 --> 01:14:38.507
WAS FIFTEEN SIXTEEN SIXTEEN

01:14:38.574 --> 01:14:40.209
SEVENTEEN AND SEVENTEEN EIGHTEEN

01:14:40.275 --> 01:14:41.376
FOR YOU SEE THEY DID SET A

01:14:41.443 --> 01:14:42.444
BUDGET YOU'RE PLUS ONE

01:14:42.511 --> 01:14:43.612
ENROLLMENT TARGET.

01:14:43.679 --> 01:14:45.714
SO YOU SEE AS OF RIGHT NOW HAS

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:47.583
MADE A LOT OF VIRTUALLY MOST OF

01:14:47.649 --> 01:14:49.484
ITS DECISIONS FOR THE NINETEEN

01:14:49.551 --> 01:14:50.419
TWENTY SCHOOL YEAR.

01:14:50.485 --> 01:14:52.154
SO SOME OF WHAT YOU DO RIGHT NOW

01:14:52.221 --> 01:14:53.388
FOR YOU SEE WILL HAVE LITTLE

01:14:53.455 --> 01:14:55.023
IMPACT ON THE COMING SCHOOL YEAR

01:14:55.090 --> 01:14:56.491
SO WHAT THE STATE HAD STARTED

01:14:56.558 --> 01:14:58.293
DOING WAS TO SAY WELL NOW WE'RE

01:14:58.360 --> 01:15:01.463
GOING TO GIVE THEM A TARGET FOR

01:15:01.530 --> 01:15:02.064
TWENTY TWENTY ONE SO.

01:15:02.130 --> 01:15:03.866
AS THEY GO THROUGH THEIR

01:15:03.932 --> 01:15:06.969
NOVEMBER A LOT OF OFFERS YOU CAN

01:15:07.035 --> 01:15:08.637
INFLUENCE WHAT THEY DO THEY CAN

01:15:08.704 --> 01:15:11.073
KNOW WHAT YOUR EXPECTATION AS WE

01:15:11.139 --> 01:15:12.574
STILL ENCOURAGE YOU TO MAKE THAT

01:15:12.641 --> 01:15:14.576
A PRACTICE FOR UC AS SEEMS TO BE

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:15.944
A WAY FOR YOU TO BE MUCH MORE

01:15:16.011 --> 01:15:17.012
INFLUENTIAL.

01:15:17.079 --> 01:15:18.847
IN WHAT YOU WANT THEIR

01:15:18.914 --> 01:15:20.148
ENROLLMENT LEVELS TO BE.

01:15:20.215 --> 01:15:21.984
ON THE STATE HAS HAD SORT OF

01:15:22.050 --> 01:15:23.585
MIXED SUCCESS DOING IT WITH THE

01:15:23.652 --> 01:15:24.586
ISSUE BECAUSE THE ISSUE AS A

01:15:24.653 --> 01:15:25.988
LITTLE BIT MORE FLEXIBILITY TO

01:15:26.054 --> 01:15:27.489
CHANGE AT SPRING IN ROME AT

01:15:27.556 --> 01:15:29.024
LEVELS SUCH THAT CITING AN OUT

01:15:29.091 --> 01:15:30.726
YOUR TARGET DOESN'T SEEM QUITE

01:15:30.792 --> 01:15:32.728
AS ESSENTIAL FOR THEM --

01:15:32.794 --> 01:15:34.029
BUT IT IS AN OLD IT IS A WAY TO

01:15:34.096 --> 01:15:35.464
GIVE BOTH YOU AND TO THE

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:36.832
SEGMENTS A LITTLE BIT MORE

01:15:36.899 --> 01:15:39.167
PREDICTABILITY ON YOUR

01:15:39.234 --> 01:15:42.004
EXPECTATIONS.

01:15:42.070 --> 01:15:43.238
THANK YOU MISTER GALLAGHER IT'S

01:15:43.305 --> 01:15:45.774

BY THE WAY YEAH BUT THAT'S EVEN

01:15:46.475 --> 01:15:49.511
MORE REASON TO TAKE A LOOK AT

01:15:49.578 --> 01:15:51.647
THAT [inaudible] THIRTEEN

01:15:51.713 --> 01:15:53.015

WITH THE ALLOCATIONS BOTH FOR UC

01:16:01.189 --> 01:16:02.658

PROJECTS THAT THE UC AND CSU WE

01:16:20.876 --> 01:16:22.311
USE THESE FUNDS.

01:16:22.377 --> 01:16:23.412
FOR HOWEVER BOTH SEGMENTS TO

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:25.247
HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IDENTIFIED

01:16:25.314 --> 01:16:28.517
BACKLOG FOR MAINTENANCE PROJECTS.

01:16:28.583 --> 01:16:29.084
ARE YOU GOING TO PUT A LIST

01:16:29.151 --> 01:16:29.518

I WILL BE WORKING WITH YOU SEE

01:16:30.852 --> 01:16:32.854

WERE TO TO SORT OF LOOK THE WITH

01:16:34.723 --> 01:16:35.691
WHICH PROJECT WILL BE FINE WITH

THE SCHOLARS AND MAYBE WE COULD

ALL.

01:16:37.592 --> 01:16:38.093
DO THAT TOGETHER [inaudible]

01:16:38.160 --> 01:16:39.428
CERTAINLY.

01:16:39.494 --> 01:16:40.629
YEAH AND AS YOU'VE PROBABLY

01:16:40.696 --> 01:16:41.797
KNOWN FROM OUR EARLIER WORK BUT

01:16:41.863 --> 01:16:43.465
WE HAVE RECOMMENDED THAT THE

01:16:43.532 --> 01:16:44.866
SEGMENTS BE REQUIRED TO SUBMIT

01:16:44.933 --> 01:16:46.201
THEIR PROPOSED PROJECTS THAT

01:16:46.268 --> 01:16:48.036
FINANCE BE REQUIRED A FEW YEARS

01:16:48.103 --> 01:16:48.770
DOWN THE ROAD TO TELL YOU

01:16:48.837 --> 01:16:49.972
WHETHER THOSE PROJECTS WERE

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.640
ACTUALLY UNDERTAKEN. FOR THEM

01:16:51.707 --> 01:16:53.008
BOTH TO BE RESPONSIBLE FOR

01:16:53.075 --> 01:16:54.776
REDUCING THE BACKLOG AT THE SAME

01:16:54.843 --> 01:16:56.211
TIME YOU'RE TRYING TO REDUCE THE

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:57.913
BACKLOG AND THEN IDEALLY THEY

01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:59.982
EVEN HAVE A PLAN FOR ADDRESSING

01:17:00.048 --> 01:17:02.150
THEIR OUR BACKLOG ON A LONG TERM

01:17:02.217 --> 01:17:03.785
BASIS.

01:17:03.852 --> 01:17:05.387
I COMPLETELY AGREE WITH LA --

01:17:05.454 --> 01:17:07.556
LAST YEAR AT THE MAY REVISION

01:17:07.622 --> 01:17:10.959
AND COULD MONEY FOR DEFERRED

01:17:11.026 --> 01:17:12.227
MAINTENANCE I THINK THAT WAS ON

01:17:12.294 --> 01:17:13.962
IT MADE A LOT OF SENSE BUT ALSO

01:17:14.029 --> 01:17:14.796
BECAUSE IT HAPPENED AT SUCH A

01:17:14.863 --> 01:17:16.231
LATE -- LATE

01:17:16.298 --> 01:17:17.432
TIME IT WAS DIFFICULT TO

01:17:17.499 --> 01:17:19.201
ACTUALLY BREAK OUT THE SPECIFIC

01:17:19.267 --> 01:17:20.402
ITEMS.

01:17:20.469 --> 01:17:21.703
I DON'T THINK FROM --

01:17:21.770 --> 01:17:23.538
ONGOING BUDGETARY PRACTICE IT'S

01:17:23.605 --> 01:17:26.208
A VERY RESPONSIBLE PRACTICE SO --

01:17:26.274 --> 01:17:26.842
I THINK COULD BE HELPFUL TO KNOW

01:17:26.908 --> 01:17:31.013
WHERE WHEN POWER SPENT FOR IT

01:17:31.079 --> 01:17:32.514
FOR THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR.

01:17:32.581 --> 01:17:33.849
AND THEN MOVING FORWARD I THINK

01:17:33.915 --> 01:17:35.117
IT WOULD BE --

01:17:35.183 --> 01:17:36.284
MUCH MORE RESPONSIBLE TO

01:17:36.351 --> 01:17:38.954
ACTUALLY BREAK OUT THE EXPENSES --

01:17:39.021 --> 01:17:41.656
AT THIS POINT WE'VE BEEN TRYING.

01:17:41.723 --> 01:17:42.891
TO GET --

01:17:42.958 --> 01:17:45.060
SORT OF MORE INFORMATION IT'S

01:17:45.127 --> 01:17:47.295

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:49.798
SO IT WOULD BE IT WOULD BE

01:17:49.865 --> 01:17:50.699
HELPFUL --

01:17:50.766 --> 01:17:52.567
BEFORE WE COULD REALLY APPROVE

01:17:52.634 --> 01:17:53.735
ANY APPROPRIATIONS THE COULD BE

01:17:53.802 --> 01:17:55.437
DIFFICULT WITHOUT OUT THE LIST

01:17:55.504 --> 01:18:01.710

AREAS RELATED TO THIS YEAR'S

01:19:53.321 --> 01:19:55.257

I WILL NOT REQUESTED UNIVERSITY

01:20:00.996 --> 01:20:02.898
OF CALIFORNIA BOARD OF REGENTS

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:04.666
INCREASED TUITION FOR IN STATE

01:20:04.733 --> 01:20:08.103
STUDENTS. FOR THE TWENTY

01:20:08.170 --> 01:20:09.504
NINETEEN TWENTY ACADEMIC YEAR

01:20:09.571 --> 01:20:11.373
THIS WILL MARK THE SEVENTH TIME

01:20:11.439 --> 01:20:12.774
IN EIGHT YEARS THAT WE HAVE NOT

01:20:12.841 --> 01:20:15.544
INCREASED IN STATE TUITION.

01:20:15.610 --> 01:20:16.878
AT THE UC.

01:20:16.945 --> 01:20:18.413
OF A BOARD OF REGENTS CHAIR

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.215
GEORGE KEEPER IT INDICATED IN

01:20:20.282 --> 01:20:22.551
JANUARY THAT HE DID NOT FAVOR

01:20:22.617 --> 01:20:23.952
TUITION INCREASE.

01:20:24.019 --> 01:20:25.587
AND HOLDING TUITION FLAT

01:20:25.654 --> 01:20:27.389
REFLECTS OUR MUTUAL GOALS AND

01:20:27.455 --> 01:20:28.690
INTENT.

01:20:28.757 --> 01:20:29.991
HOWEVER.

01:20:30.058 --> 01:20:31.326
THE COMMITTEE IN THE LEGISLATURE

01:20:31.393 --> 01:20:35.330
NEWS TO BE HOLDING TUITION FLAT.

01:20:35.397 --> 01:20:37.632
MEANS THAT THE UNIVERSITY HAS

01:20:37.699 --> 01:20:39.935
LESS INSTITUTIONAL AID TO

01:20:40.001 --> 01:20:41.670
DISTRIBUTE TO OUR POOREST

01:20:41.736 --> 01:20:43.238
STUDENTS FOR THEIR LIVING

01:20:43.305 --> 01:20:44.372
EXPENSES.

01:20:44.439 --> 01:20:46.441
CURRENTLY WE TAKE ONE THIRD OF

01:20:46.508 --> 01:20:49.110
OUR TUITION REVENUE AND RETURN

01:20:49.177 --> 01:20:50.845
IT TO AID TO OUR NEEDIEST

01:20:50.912 --> 01:20:52.047
STUDENTS --

01:20:52.113 --> 01:20:53.848
THEY CAN USE THAT FOR HOUSING

01:20:53.915 --> 01:20:55.183
AND FOR FOOD.

01:20:55.250 --> 01:20:57.886
AND IF WE HOLD TUITION FLAT THAT

01:20:57.953 --> 01:20:59.621
AMOUNT DOES NOT GROW.

01:20:59.688 --> 01:21:02.157
WE'LL ALSO WORKED AGGRESSIVELY

01:21:02.224 --> 01:21:04.125
TO CONTAIN COSTS WITHOUT

01:21:04.192 --> 01:21:06.061
IMPACTING THE QUALITY OF

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:08.096
EDUCATION ALL WHILE IN ROLLING

01:21:08.163 --> 01:21:10.498
MORE CALIFORNIA STUDENTS THAN

01:21:10.565 --> 01:21:12.267
EVER BEFORE --

01:21:12.334 --> 01:21:15.403
BUT DOING SO AS CERTAINLY HAD AN

01:21:15.470 --> 01:21:18.006
IMPACT ON OUR CAMPUSES.

01:21:18.073 --> 01:21:19.608
UP AND WHILE I'M DELIGHTED TO

01:21:19.674 --> 01:21:21.109
MAKE THIS ANNOUNCEMENT TODAY

01:21:21.176 --> 01:21:23.078
BECAUSE HOLDING IN STATE TUITION

01:21:23.144 --> 01:21:25.714
FLAT IS A GOAL WE ALSO OUGHT TO

01:21:25.780 --> 01:21:26.848
ATTAIN.

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:29.050
AS LEGISLATORS YOU SURELY

01:21:29.117 --> 01:21:31.620
RECOGNIZE THAT MANDATORY COSTS

01:21:31.686 --> 01:21:33.088
CONTINUE TO INCREASE.

01:21:33.154 --> 01:21:35.123
STATE FUNDING WHILE SUBSTANTIAL

01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:37.425
HAS NOT BEEN COMMENSURATE.

01:21:37.492 --> 01:21:39.127
WITH COVERING THE INCREASED

01:21:39.194 --> 01:21:41.596
ENROLLMENT AND ASSOCIATED COSTS

01:21:41.663 --> 01:21:44.165
WITH THE INCREASE ENROLLMENT

01:21:44.232 --> 01:21:46.001
THAT WE HAVE AND KURT.

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:47.535
I'D ALSO LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE

01:21:47.602 --> 01:21:49.170
HOLDING TUITION FLAT FOR THIS

01:21:49.237 --> 01:21:51.106
MANY YEARS HAS NOT COME WITHOUT

01:21:51.172 --> 01:21:52.540
CHALLENGES.

01:21:52.607 --> 01:21:55.410
AND REQUIRED A LOT OF WORK ON

01:21:55.477 --> 01:21:56.945
THE PART OF OUR CAMPUSES.

01:21:57.012 --> 01:22:00.282
SINCE TWO THOUSAND ELEVEN TWELVE

01:22:00.348 --> 01:22:02.917
YOU SEE HAS INCREASED BY ONLY

01:22:02.984 --> 01:22:04.386
TWO POINT 5%.

01:22:04.452 --> 01:22:06.955
COMPARED TO AN 18% INCREASE IN

01:22:07.022 --> 01:22:08.957
THE COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES

01:22:09.024 --> 01:22:11.226
AS MEASURED BY THE CALIFORNIA

01:22:11.293 --> 01:22:12.727
CPI.

01:22:12.794 --> 01:22:15.597
WE ALL NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO

01:22:15.664 --> 01:22:16.698
ENSURE THAT THE UNIVERSITY OF

01:22:16.765 --> 01:22:18.533
CALIFORNIA HAS SUFFICIENT

01:22:18.600 --> 01:22:21.336
RESOURCES. TO ENSURE OUR

01:22:21.403 --> 01:22:23.505
STUDENTS CAN SUCCEED IN THAT

01:22:23.571 --> 01:22:25.974
THEY EXPERIENCE THE QUALITY OF

01:22:26.041 --> 01:22:28.610
THE UC EDUCATION FOR WHICH WE

01:22:28.677 --> 01:22:30.345
ARE JUSTLY KNOWN.

01:22:30.412 --> 01:22:32.881
THIS MEANS THAT WE EITHER HAVE --

01:22:32.947 --> 01:22:35.850
HAVE MODERATE PREDICTABLE STABLE

01:22:35.917 --> 01:22:37.385
TUITION INCREASES.

01:22:37.452 --> 01:22:40.155
OR A COMMENSURATE AMOUNT OF

01:22:40.221 --> 01:22:41.656
ONGOING STATE FUNDING

01:22:41.723 --> 01:22:43.558
ACCOMPANIED BY ROBUST FINANCIAL

01:22:43.625 --> 01:22:45.060
AID.

01:22:45.126 --> 01:22:47.429
IT IS WITH THIS IN MIND THAT YOU

01:22:47.495 --> 01:22:49.197
SEE AND ITS CHANCELLORS IN

01:22:49.264 --> 01:22:50.598
CONSULTATION WITH THE BOARD OF

01:22:50.665 --> 01:22:51.700
REGENTS.

01:22:51.766 --> 01:22:53.468
ARE DEVELOPING A MULTI YEAR

01:22:53.535 --> 01:22:56.638
VISION FOR THE UC OF THE FUTURE.

01:22:56.705 --> 01:22:58.239
INFORMED BY THE STATE'S NEEDS

01:22:58.306 --> 01:23:00.041
AND STRATEGIES FOR REALIZING

01:23:00.108 --> 01:23:01.343
THAT VISION.

01:23:01.409 --> 01:23:03.445
THE DRIVING FORCE BEHIND THIS

01:23:03.511 --> 01:23:05.313
PLAN IS TO STRENGTHEN UC'S

01:23:05.380 --> 01:23:07.415
CONTRIBUTION TO THE CALIFORNIA

01:23:07.482 --> 01:23:09.517
DREAM AND PIVOT FROM YEAR TO

01:23:09.584 --> 01:23:10.885

APPROACH THAT AIMS TO ACHIEVE

01:23:16.024 --> 01:23:19.861
BOLD ASPIRATIONAL GOALS OVER A

01:23:19.928 --> 01:23:21.162
LONGER PERIOD OF TIME.

01:23:21.229 --> 01:23:22.697
OUR MULTI YEAR FRAMEWORK

01:23:22.764 --> 01:23:26.601
CONTAINS GOALS SUCH AS AWARDING

01:23:26.668 --> 01:23:27.135
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND MORE

01:23:27.202 --> 01:23:27.736

01:23:27.802 --> 01:23:30.004
BY TWENTY THIRTY IN ADDITION TO

01:23:30.071 --> 01:23:33.141
THE MILLION DEGREES ALREADY PLAN.

01:23:33.208 --> 01:23:35.110
REDUCING THE TIME IT TAKES A

01:23:35.176 --> 01:23:36.644
STUDENT TO GRADUATE.

01:23:36.711 --> 01:23:38.279
AND ASSIST STUDENTS WHO LEFT YOU

COMPLETING THEIR DEGREE.

01:23:42.784 --> 01:23:44.652
AND GROWING A DIVERSE FACULTY

01:23:44.719 --> 01:23:46.654
SHOW THAT WE ARE MORE REFLECTIVE

01:23:46.721 --> 01:23:48.857
OF THE POPULATION WE SERVE.

01:23:48.923 --> 01:23:50.959
AND HAVE THE ABILITY TO SUPPORT

01:23:51.025 --> 01:23:52.994
RELATION.

01:23:53.061 --> 01:23:54.863
WE'VE BEGUN TO SHARE OUR MULTI

01:23:54.929 --> 01:23:56.097

01:24:02.904 --> 01:24:05.440
WE BELIEVE OUR VISION WILL ALLOW

01:24:05.507 --> 01:24:07.475
THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA TO

01:24:07.542 --> 01:24:09.911
CONTINUE TO DO ITS PART.

01:24:09.978 --> 01:24:12.747
IN MAKING THE CALIFORNIA DURING

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:14.783
THE UC DREAM A REALITY FOR

01:24:14.849 --> 01:24:16.518
HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF YOUNG

01:24:16.584 --> 01:24:17.852
PEOPLE.

01:24:17.919 --> 01:24:19.387
THIS PLAN REQUIRES YOUR

01:24:19.454 --> 01:24:20.688
PARTNERSHIP.

01:24:20.755 --> 01:24:22.457
IT'S DEPENDENT ON A PARTNERSHIP

01:24:22.524 --> 01:24:23.958
WITH THE STATE TO ENSURE THE

01:24:24.025 --> 01:24:25.994

MAINTAIN ACCESS AFFORDABILITY.

01:24:28.863 --> 01:24:31.800
AND IMPORTANTLY QUALITY.

01:24:31.866 --> 01:24:33.234
I'D LIKE TO SPEND A FEW MINUTES

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:34.502
ON THE GOVERNOR'S BUDGET

01:24:34.569 --> 01:24:36.070

THE UNIVERSITY IS ADDED MORE

01:24:53.688 --> 01:24:56.257

01:51:02.055 --> 01:51:03.323
WE'RE COMMITTED TO CLOSING THOSE

01:51:03.390 --> 01:51:04.357
ACHIEVEMENT GAPS OR WHETHER

01:51:04.424 --> 01:51:06.693
THEY'RE PURSUING A CERTIFICATE.

01:51:06.760 --> 01:51:07.994
AN ASSOCIATE'S DEGREE OR

01:51:08.061 --> 01:51:10.597
TRANSFER THEIR ACHIEVING THEM --

01:51:10.663 --> 01:51:12.899
IT EQUAL RATES ACROSS RACIAL

01:51:12.966 --> 01:51:14.934
ETHNIC AS WELL AS GENDER --

01:51:15.001 --> 01:51:18.505
LINES.

01:51:18.571 --> 01:51:20.573
YEAH THANK YOU SO AS AS I

01:51:20.640 --> 01:51:21.841
MENTIONED --

01:51:21.908 --> 01:51:23.777
OR WE HAVE.

01:51:23.843 --> 01:51:25.812
DEVELOPED A FOUR YEAR --

01:51:25.879 --> 01:51:28.648
FRAMEWORK --

01:51:28.715 --> 01:51:30.016
THAT --

01:51:30.083 --> 01:51:31.484
PROVIDES --

01:51:31.551 --> 01:51:34.087
THAT WE WILL INCREASE THE NUMBER

01:51:34.154 --> 01:51:36.122
OF GRADUATES GRADUATE DEGREE --

01:51:36.189 --> 01:51:38.425
DEGREES BOTH UNDERGRADUATE

01:51:38.491 --> 01:51:40.160
GRADUATE BY --

01:51:40.226 --> 01:51:42.262
TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND BY --

01:51:42.328 --> 01:51:44.531
TWENTY THREE AND TO DO THAT ONE

01:51:44.597 --> 01:51:47.033
OF THE THINGS.

01:51:47.100 --> 01:51:49.369
IS TO REDUCE THE TIME TO

01:51:49.436 --> 01:51:51.004
GRADUATION --

01:51:51.071 --> 01:51:53.306
SO THAT THE SIX IS GO TO FIVE IN

01:51:53.373 --> 01:51:54.741
THE FIVE TO FOUR HOURS.

01:51:54.808 --> 01:51:58.211
THAT WOULD PARTICULARLY IMPACT

01:51:58.278 --> 01:52:00.380
ARE A FIRST GENERATION PELL

01:52:00.447 --> 01:52:02.048
GRANT AND UNDER REPRESENTED

01:52:02.115 --> 01:52:03.716
MINORITY STUDENTS WHO ARE

01:52:03.783 --> 01:52:05.785
TENDING TO TAKE LONGER TO GET

01:52:05.852 --> 01:52:06.886
THEIR DEGREES.

01:52:06.953 --> 01:52:09.355
SO AS WE IF IF WE CAN GRADUATE

01:52:09.422 --> 01:52:11.624
THEM MORE QUICKLY MOVE THE MODEL

01:52:11.691 --> 01:52:13.026
PROFESSIONAL OR GRADUATE SCHOOL

01:52:13.093 --> 01:52:15.095
OR IN THE WORKPLACE THAT OPENS

01:52:15.161 --> 01:52:17.564
UP ANOTHER SPACE FOR ANOTHER

01:52:17.630 --> 01:52:20.533
UNDERGRADUATE.

01:52:20.600 --> 01:52:23.236
SO THAT THAT'S CORRECT.

01:52:23.303 --> 01:52:24.571
SO MEMBERS LIMóN THANKS FOR THE

01:52:24.637 --> 01:52:25.939
WONDERFUL QUESTIONS SO.

01:52:26.005 --> 01:52:28.374
ARE GRADUATION INITIATIVE --

01:52:28.441 --> 01:52:29.342
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE THAT WE

01:52:29.409 --> 01:52:31.277
LAUNCHED IN.

01:52:31.344 --> 01:52:32.846
TWENTY SIXTEEN IS A OF A MULTI

01:52:32.912 --> 01:52:33.813
YEAR PLAN.

01:52:33.880 --> 01:52:36.082
OF DAD WE IMAGINED NEW

01:52:36.149 --> 01:52:37.584
INVESTMENT IN EVERY YEAR OVER

01:52:37.650 --> 01:52:39.252
THE COURSE OF SIX YEARS EACH

01:52:39.319 --> 01:52:41.154
BEING IT SEVENTY FIVE MILLION.

01:52:41.221 --> 01:52:43.556
WE PRICES OUT IT'S ABOUT A OF

01:52:43.623 --> 01:52:44.524
FIVE HUNDRED MILLION DOLLAR --

01:52:44.591 --> 01:52:46.459
EFFORT IN ORDER TO IMPROVE OUR

01:52:46.526 --> 01:52:47.861
GRADUATION RATES.

01:52:47.927 --> 01:52:51.865
DECREASE THE TIME TO DEGREE AND

01:52:51.931 --> 01:52:53.333
MAINTAIN HIGH QUALITY.

01:52:53.399 --> 01:52:54.134
WE WENT INTO THE TWENTY THREE

01:52:54.200 --> 01:52:56.102
CAMPUSES AND ANALYZED

01:52:56.169 --> 01:52:57.937
INDIVIDUALLY.

01:52:58.004 --> 01:52:59.739
IN IN ALL THE FEELS OF THE THE

01:52:59.806 --> 01:53:02.642
STUDENT TIME TO DEGREE AND WHAT

01:53:02.709 --> 01:53:03.176
THE POSSIBILITIES WERE FOR

01:53:03.243 --> 01:53:04.577
IMPROVEMENT --

01:53:04.644 --> 01:53:06.212
SO IT'S ONE SIZE DOESN'T FIT ALL

01:53:06.279 --> 01:53:09.282
WHEN YOU LOOK AT ACROSS THE

01:53:09.349 --> 01:53:09.849
TWENTY THREE IN TERMS OF THE

01:53:09.916 --> 01:53:10.917
STUDENTS OF THAT WE SERVE.

01:53:10.984 --> 01:53:11.751
AND THEN WE AGGREGATED JUST

01:53:11.818 --> 01:53:14.454
ACROSS THIS IS OF THE VARIOUS

01:53:14.521 --> 01:53:15.955
CAMPUSES HE CAME UP WITH THE

01:53:16.022 --> 01:53:17.924
SYSTEM LEVEL GOALS --

01:53:17.991 --> 01:53:20.426
IF YOU LOOK AT OUR ABILITY TO DO

01:53:20.493 --> 01:53:21.961
OUR PIECE OF THE MILLION DOLLAR

01:53:22.028 --> 01:53:23.530
MILLION DOLLAR I WHICH IS ONLY A

01:53:23.596 --> 01:53:25.231
MILLION DOLLARS --

01:53:25.298 --> 01:53:27.934
THE MILLION DEGREE GAP THAT THE

01:53:28.001 --> 01:53:29.602
DROUGHT THIS FACING CALIFORNIA.

01:53:29.669 --> 01:53:32.505
IS WE FEEL OUR A PORTION OF THAT

01:53:32.572 --> 01:53:33.506
IS 50%.

01:53:33.573 --> 01:53:35.408
AND SO WE PUT THIS BOTTLE

01:53:35.475 --> 01:53:38.578
TOGETHER REQUIRES TWO ELEMENTS.

01:53:38.645 --> 01:53:40.813
ONE ELEMENT IS FIRST TO CONTINUE

01:53:40.880 --> 01:53:42.415
DOING CREE AND MAGE.

01:53:42.482 --> 01:53:43.716
MEET OUR IMPROVEMENTS IN

01:53:43.783 --> 01:53:45.018
GRADUATION RATES SO.

01:53:45.084 --> 01:53:47.086
IN OF THE FOUR YEAR RATE --

01:53:47.153 --> 01:53:48.855
FOR HALF YOUR RATE TO FIVE EVERY

01:53:48.922 --> 01:53:51.124
EVERY RATE YOU CAN MEASURE WE

01:53:51.191 --> 01:53:52.759
WANTED TO BECOME BETTER --

01:53:52.825 --> 01:53:54.260
ANOTHER WAY TO LOOK AT THAT IS

01:53:54.327 --> 01:53:56.029
IF YOU LOOK AT THE NUMBER OF

01:53:56.095 --> 01:53:58.097
DEGREES EARNED OVER A TIME FOR

01:53:58.164 --> 01:53:58.965
STUDENT.

01:53:59.032 --> 01:54:00.466
VERY FEW GET A FOUR YEAR DEGREE

01:54:00.533 --> 01:54:01.701
IN LESS THAN THREE YEARS THERE

01:54:01.768 --> 01:54:03.836
ARE SOME WHO CAME IN WITH A LOT

01:54:03.903 --> 01:54:05.505
OF CREDITS FROM AP COURSES AND

01:54:05.572 --> 01:54:07.307
GO YEAR ROUND AND GET HER

01:54:07.373 --> 01:54:08.174
BACHELOR'S DEGREE IN THREE YEARS

01:54:08.241 --> 01:54:09.576
BUT THERE IS A VERY MINOR.

01:54:09.642 --> 01:54:11.044
NUMBER A LOT OF STUDENTS GET

01:54:11.110 --> 01:54:14.480
ABOUT FOUR AFTER FOUR YEARS ONE

01:54:14.547 --> 01:54:15.982
SEMESTER FOR HALF FIVES.

01:54:16.049 --> 01:54:17.984
AND THE WHOLE IDEA IS LOOKING AT

01:54:18.051 --> 01:54:20.753
DISTRIBUTION CURVE.

01:54:20.820 --> 01:54:22.655
SO OUR GOAL IS TO TAKE THAT

01:54:22.722 --> 01:54:24.591
ENTIRE DISTRIBUTION CURVE MOVING

01:54:24.657 --> 01:54:26.226
UP INTO THE LEFT.

01:54:26.292 --> 01:54:28.895
SO THE SINGLE MOM WHO'S WORKING --

01:54:28.962 --> 01:54:30.730
FORTY HOUR WEEK AND IS ON THE

01:54:30.797 --> 01:54:32.432
SIX YEAR PLAN LET'S MAKE SURE

01:54:32.498 --> 01:54:34.000
THE UNIVERSITY HELPS HER AND SHE

01:54:34.067 --> 01:54:35.468
THAT DEGREE IN FIVE AND A HALF

01:54:35.535 --> 01:54:36.769
YEARS WHAT A WONDERFUL

01:54:36.836 --> 01:54:38.304
ACCOMPLISHMENT FOR HER AND HER

01:54:38.371 --> 01:54:40.173
FAMILY.

01:54:40.240 --> 01:54:41.874
IT REQUIRES TWO THINGS ONE IS

01:54:41.941 --> 01:54:43.209
THIS RELENTLESS INVESTMENT IN

01:54:43.276 --> 01:54:44.877
THE GRADUATION INITIATIVE WHICH

01:54:44.944 --> 01:54:46.312
IS PART OF OUR BUDGET ASKING

01:54:46.379 --> 01:54:48.248
WHICH IS BEEN.

01:54:48.314 --> 01:54:49.616
PARTIALLY FUNDED BY THE GOVERNOR.

01:54:49.682 --> 01:54:51.417
AND THE SECOND IS TO INCREASE

01:54:51.484 --> 01:54:53.119
OUR ENROLLMENTS SO THERE'S MORE

01:54:53.186 --> 01:54:55.021
STUDENTS ACHIEVING AT A HIGHER

01:54:55.088 --> 01:54:56.923
RATE IT'S A MATHEMATICAL

01:54:56.990 --> 01:54:58.358
COMBINATION OF DOING BETTER.

01:54:58.424 --> 01:54:59.792
INTERNING DEGREE AND MORE

01:54:59.859 --> 01:55:01.861
STUDENTS HAVING THAT OPPORTUNITY

01:55:01.928 --> 01:55:03.263
WHEN THOSE TWO THINGS COME

01:55:03.329 --> 01:55:04.330
TOGETHER.

01:55:04.397 --> 01:55:07.267
WE WILL REACH THAT FIVE HUNDRED

01:55:07.333 --> 01:55:08.668
THOUSAND AND THAT'S WHY WE HAVE

01:55:08.735 --> 01:55:10.003
MADE THAT THE TRUSTEES REQUEST

01:55:10.069 --> 01:55:11.604
IS. TO INVEST.

01:55:11.671 --> 01:55:14.207
HI MORE MORE HIGHLY THAN THE

01:55:14.274 --> 01:55:15.808
GOVERNOR HAS.

01:55:15.875 --> 01:55:17.543
SUGGESTED IN HIS INITIAL BUDGET

01:55:17.610 --> 01:55:18.811
WILL FUND AND ROMAN AND ON THE

01:55:18.878 --> 01:55:20.813
GRADUATION INITIATIVE AND WE'RE

01:55:20.880 --> 01:55:21.381
READY WILLING AND ABLE TO DO

01:55:21.447 --> 01:55:23.249
MORE.

01:55:23.316 --> 01:55:25.985
WITH RESPECT TO THE EQUITY GAP I

01:55:26.052 --> 01:55:26.619
THINK --

01:55:26.686 --> 01:55:29.889
CHANCE FOR OF ORTIZ IS COMMON IT

01:55:29.956 --> 01:55:32.792
IS EXACTLY RIGHT I THINK THE YOU

01:55:32.859 --> 01:55:34.193
I POINTED OUT THAT THE EQUITY

01:55:34.260 --> 01:55:36.529
GAP IS THEIR GRADUATION RATE IN

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:38.131
AGAIN HOWEVER YOU CALCULATED AT

01:55:38.197 --> 01:55:41.501
THE FOUR FIVE SIX SEVEN EIGHT

01:55:41.567 --> 01:55:41.801
YEAR LEVEL.

01:55:41.868 --> 01:55:46.306
OF HIS HAS HISTORICALLY --

01:55:46.372 --> 01:55:48.308
FOR STUDENTS WHO COME FROM.

01:55:48.374 --> 01:55:49.809
LOW INCOME.

01:55:49.876 --> 01:55:52.612
WHO ARE FIRST GENERATION AND WHO

01:55:52.679 --> 01:55:54.147
ARE THEN OFTEN OF COLOR?

01:55:54.213 --> 01:55:56.282
AND SO OUR RELENTLESS FOCUS ON

01:55:56.349 --> 01:55:57.617
IMPROVING GETTING RID OF THE

01:55:57.684 --> 01:55:59.252
EQUITY GAPS YOU KNOW THE WORD

01:55:59.319 --> 01:56:01.454
RAISING THEIR GRADUATION RATES

01:56:01.521 --> 01:56:03.356
OF THOSE STUDENTS WHO COME UP

01:56:03.423 --> 01:56:04.157
FROM THE UNDERSERVED PART OF

01:56:04.223 --> 01:56:04.924
SOCIETY.

01:56:04.991 --> 01:56:06.659
MORE THAN RAISING THE GRADUATION

01:56:06.726 --> 01:56:08.294
RATES FOR THOSE WHO COME FROM

01:56:08.361 --> 01:56:10.029
THE PROVISION OF OUR SOCIETY.

01:56:10.096 --> 01:56:11.664
WHO?

01:56:11.731 --> 01:56:12.799
DECREASES THAT AND THAT WE'VE

01:56:12.865 --> 01:56:14.467
MOVED THAT TWO PERCENTAGE POINTS

01:56:14.534 --> 01:56:15.802
SOME OF OUR CAMPUSES HAVE NOW NO

01:56:15.868 --> 01:56:17.303
EQUITY GAPS.

01:56:17.370 --> 01:56:18.271
IN FACT STUDENTS WHO COME FROM

01:56:18.338 --> 01:56:19.806
THE UNDER REPRESENTED HERE IS

01:56:19.872 --> 01:56:21.274
ACTUALLY ACHIEVING BETTER THAN

01:56:21.341 --> 01:56:22.241
THOSE WHO COME.

01:56:22.308 --> 01:56:23.609
FROM THE MORE TRADITIONAL AREAS

01:56:23.676 --> 01:56:26.179
SO WE HAVE MADE THAT IS A SORT

01:56:26.245 --> 01:56:27.480
OF OUR MOON SHOT --

01:56:27.547 --> 01:56:29.449
TO GET RID OF EQUITY GAPS OF THE

01:56:29.515 --> 01:56:30.516
CALIFORNIA STATE UNIVERSITY IT'S

01:56:30.583 --> 01:56:32.118
A IT'S A BIG LEFT.

01:56:32.185 --> 01:56:33.219
AND WE DON'T CONTROL ALL OF

01:56:33.286 --> 01:56:35.555
VARIABLES BECAUSE WE ONLY CAN DO

01:56:35.621 --> 01:56:36.422
IS WHAT.

01:56:36.489 --> 01:56:38.124
OUR STUDENTS BRING TO US AND

01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:38.958
SOME OF COME OUT A VERY

01:56:39.025 --> 01:56:40.760
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES THAT

01:56:40.827 --> 01:56:42.395
TAKE MORE TIME TO ACHIEVE.

01:56:42.462 --> 01:56:44.864
THAT IS OUR MORAL COMMITMENT TO

01:56:44.931 --> 01:56:46.799
GET RID OF THE EQUITY GAP IS

01:56:46.866 --> 01:56:47.400
MATTER HOW LONG IT TAKES WILL

01:56:47.467 --> 01:56:50.937
GET THEIR THANK YOU I APPRECIATE

01:56:51.003 --> 01:56:53.206
THE COMMENTS --

01:56:53.272 --> 01:56:54.941
I THINK I'M STILL GRAPPLING IN

01:56:55.007 --> 01:56:55.808
ANYTHING'S ASSEMBLYMEMBER

01:56:55.875 --> 01:56:57.310
O'DONNELL KIND OF TOUCHED ON

01:56:57.377 --> 01:56:58.544
THIS IN ONE OF YOUR PREVIOUS.

01:56:58.611 --> 01:56:59.879
QUESTIONS I'M TRAVELING A LITTLE

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:02.382
BIT WITH WHAT THE AVERAGE TIME

01:57:02.448 --> 01:57:04.283
TO DEGREE IS --

01:57:04.350 --> 01:57:05.585
AND HOW.

01:57:05.651 --> 01:57:09.155
THAT FORMULATES TO MEETING THE

01:57:09.222 --> 01:57:10.923
GOAL SO IF THE AVERAGE TIME TO

01:57:10.990 --> 01:57:12.859
DEGREES FOUR POINT TWO FIVE OR

01:57:12.925 --> 01:57:13.860
FOUR POINT.

01:57:13.926 --> 01:57:15.628
SEVEN THEN HOW I MEAN ARE WE

01:57:15.695 --> 01:57:18.464
REALLY LOOKING AT A THREE YEAR

01:57:18.531 --> 01:57:19.866
LIKE IT IN ORDER TO MEET THIS.

01:57:19.932 --> 01:57:21.768
BIG GAP IT JUST I DON'T KNOW HOW

01:57:21.834 --> 01:57:25.371
YOU GET THAT LOWER WITHOUT THEN.

01:57:25.438 --> 01:57:28.908
IMPACT DEAN IN THE QUALITY OF

01:57:28.975 --> 01:57:30.676
EXPERIENCE. FOR STUDENTS AND I I

01:57:30.743 --> 01:57:31.944
DON'T KNOW I'M STILL GRAPPLING

01:57:32.011 --> 01:57:33.079
WITH TRYING TO FIGURE OUT WHAT

01:57:33.146 --> 01:57:34.580
THE FORMULA IS.

01:57:34.647 --> 01:57:37.016
WITH OUT THEN --

01:57:37.083 --> 01:57:38.484
IMPACT DEAN.

01:57:38.551 --> 01:57:39.352
I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW YOU GET

01:57:39.419 --> 01:57:42.488
LOWER THE FOUR POINT --

01:57:42.555 --> 01:57:43.489
TWO FIVE FOUR POINT SEVEN IS NOT

01:57:43.556 --> 01:57:46.526
BAD AND SO WITH FOR GOING.

01:57:46.592 --> 01:57:48.027
ONE LOWER THAN THAT REALLY MEANS

01:57:48.094 --> 01:57:49.729
WERE DOING AN EXPEDITED.

01:57:49.796 --> 01:57:50.830
DEGREE AND I DON'T KNOW HOW THAT

01:57:50.897 --> 01:57:52.732
CHANGES MAYBE I'M OFF MAYBE I'M

01:57:52.799 --> 01:57:55.501
NOT HEARING THE THINGS I DON'T

01:57:55.568 --> 01:57:55.968
KNOW.

01:57:56.035 --> 01:57:57.737
MEMBER NUMBER MY MY SO AT THE

01:57:57.804 --> 01:58:00.273
UNIVERSITYOF CALIFORNIA --

01:58:00.339 --> 01:58:01.474
SIXTY SOME ODD PERCENT OF OUR

01:58:01.541 --> 01:58:04.911
STUDENTS GRADUATE IN FOUR YEARS.

01:58:04.977 --> 01:58:08.347
OF ABOUT 88% GRADUATE IN SIX

01:58:08.414 --> 01:58:09.982
YEARS.

01:58:10.049 --> 01:58:12.852
WHAT WE WANT TO DO IS GET

01:58:12.919 --> 01:58:15.321
EVERYBODY DOWN TO THAT FOUR YEAR

01:58:15.388 --> 01:58:16.756
LEVEL?

01:58:16.823 --> 01:58:19.759
AND TO DO THAT --

01:58:19.826 --> 01:58:21.561
REQUIRES --

01:58:21.627 --> 01:58:23.596
AND INVESTMENT --

01:58:23.663 --> 01:58:27.333
IN TERMS OF ADDITIONAL.

01:58:27.400 --> 01:58:30.503
FACULTY AND T. A.'S AN ACADEMIC

01:58:30.570 --> 01:58:32.205
ADVISORS --

01:58:32.271 --> 01:58:35.041
AND OTHER --

01:58:35.107 --> 01:58:37.243
PROGRAMS THAT WILL ENABLE

01:58:37.310 --> 01:58:40.346
STUDENTS --

01:58:40.413 --> 01:58:43.850
TO SUCCEED AN HONOR FOR YOUR SIX

01:58:43.916 --> 01:58:45.985
AND IT MAKES A REAL DIFFERENCE

01:58:46.052 --> 01:58:47.753
BECAUSE WHAT WE SEE.

01:58:47.820 --> 01:58:49.489
IS THAT --

01:58:49.555 --> 01:58:50.857
THE STUDENTS WHO ARE TAKING

01:58:50.923 --> 01:58:52.458
LONGER TO GRADUATE THEY DO

01:58:52.525 --> 01:58:54.227
GRADUATE.

01:58:54.293 --> 01:58:57.129
WITH A TAKEN LONGER TO GRADUATE --

01:58:57.196 --> 01:58:58.598
TEND TO COME.

01:58:58.664 --> 01:59:01.067
FROM THOSE WHO COME FROM

01:59:01.133 --> 01:59:03.336
DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES --

01:59:03.402 --> 01:59:05.137
AND SO WE NEED --

01:59:05.204 --> 01:59:06.572
TO REALLY WORK WITH THOSE

01:59:06.639 --> 01:59:08.774
STUDENTS TO GET THEM TO A FOUR

01:59:08.841 --> 01:59:11.077
YEAR GRADUATION --

01:59:11.143 --> 01:59:14.046
A DEGREE.

01:59:14.113 --> 01:59:15.715
SO I THINK IT MEMBER ALONE I

01:59:15.781 --> 01:59:17.149
THINK ONE OF THE ISSUES HERE

01:59:17.216 --> 01:59:18.417
SOMETIMES OF THE WORDS YOU GET

01:59:18.484 --> 01:59:20.586
USE WHEN WE TALK ABOUT SECURE

01:59:20.653 --> 01:59:22.021
GRADUATION RATE TO DOESN'T MEAN

01:59:22.088 --> 01:59:24.090
IT TAKES A STUDENT SIX YEARS TO

01:59:24.156 --> 01:59:26.125
GRADUATE.

01:59:26.192 --> 01:59:27.393
A STUDENT WHO GOES FOR YEARS AND

01:59:27.460 --> 01:59:29.996
ONE SEMESTER.

01:59:30.062 --> 01:59:31.130
GETS COUNTED FEDERALLY IN THE

01:59:31.197 --> 01:59:32.932
IPAD'S DATABASE IS A SIX YEAR

01:59:32.999 --> 01:59:34.166
GRADUATION RATE.

01:59:34.233 --> 01:59:35.268
IS REALLY IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE

01:59:35.334 --> 01:59:37.036
THAT SIX YEAR MEANS SIX YEARS OR

01:59:37.103 --> 01:59:39.705
LESS.

01:59:39.772 --> 01:59:41.207
THAT'S WHY ARE --

01:59:41.274 --> 01:59:42.808
MEDIAN TIME DEGREE IS.

01:59:42.875 --> 01:59:44.210
BASICALLY A LITTLE BIT OVER FOUR

01:59:44.277 --> 01:59:45.177
AND A HALF YEARS HALF OUR

01:59:45.244 --> 01:59:46.512
STUDENTS GET THEIR BACHELOR'S

01:59:46.579 --> 01:59:48.281
DEGREE IN FOR A HALF YEARS

01:59:48.347 --> 01:59:48.581
[inaudible]

01:59:48.648 --> 01:59:50.616
OR LESS.

01:59:50.683 --> 01:59:52.685
BUT THE SIX YEAR RIZZO OUR

01:59:52.752 --> 01:59:54.320
RELENTLESS FOCUS IN THE GRANT

01:59:54.387 --> 01:59:54.620
INITIATIVE.

01:59:54.687 --> 01:59:57.223
IS AND WE JUST DISCUSSED THIS IS

01:59:57.290 --> 01:59:59.926
TO RAISE THE THOSE WHO GET IN

01:59:59.992 --> 02:00:00.560
FOUR YEARS THOSE WHO GET IT FOR

02:00:00.626 --> 02:00:03.629
HALF. FIVE FIVE AND HAVE SIX AND

02:00:03.696 --> 02:00:04.931
WE CAN BECAUSE WE HAVE SO MANY

02:00:04.997 --> 02:00:06.599
STUDENTS WHO COME FROM LOW

02:00:06.666 --> 02:00:07.633
INCOME.

02:00:07.700 --> 02:00:09.602
AND FIRST GENERATION AND

02:00:09.669 --> 02:00:11.404
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES THAT

02:00:11.470 --> 02:00:13.372
FOCUSING ON THAT EQUITY GAP IS A

02:00:13.439 --> 02:00:15.308
HUGE DRIVER. TO INCREASE THE

02:00:15.374 --> 02:00:16.742
NUMBER STUDENTS TO COMPLETE

02:00:16.809 --> 02:00:18.010
THEIR DEGREE.

02:00:18.077 --> 02:00:20.947
AND DEGREE COMPLETION IS SO

02:00:21.013 --> 02:00:22.515
SIMPLE AS INSTEAD OF HAVING

02:00:22.582 --> 02:00:23.916
ADVISERS SAY.

02:00:23.983 --> 02:00:25.217
YOU KNOW WELCOME TIM I'M GLAD

DONE IN FOUR YEARS.

02:00:39.765 --> 02:00:41.267
SO PART OF IT IS RAISING THE

02:00:41.334 --> 02:00:43.569
EXPECTATIONS AND RATHER THAN

02:00:43.636 --> 02:00:45.471

02:11:46.765 --> 02:11:48.300
COST US OFF BY TEN OR SO PERCENT.

02:11:48.367 --> 02:11:49.368
I THINK WHAT YOU'RE SAYING IS

02:11:49.434 --> 02:11:51.003
THE PRIOR YEARS WE DIDN'T COVER

02:11:51.069 --> 02:11:53.405
THE STATE SHARE AND AS YOU KNOW

PRIOR YEARS AND THAT WAS.

02:12:00.712 --> 02:12:01.413
ACCOUNTED FOR AND I THINK THAT

02:12:01.480 --> 02:12:03.482
YOU WOULD HAVE ARGUED THAT THE

02:12:03.548 --> 02:12:04.583
STATE SHOULD HAVE COVERED ALL

02:12:04.650 --> 02:12:05.917
THAT BUT THOSE WERE OF THE

02:12:05.984 --> 02:12:08.186
AGREEMENTS THAT WE MAY IN THE

02:12:08.253 --> 02:12:10.455
PAST BY TWO YEARS.

02:12:10.522 --> 02:12:11.723
WE WE CAN CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT.

02:12:11.790 --> 02:12:13.058

02:12:27.572 --> 02:12:29.541
RIGHT THERE --

02:12:29.608 --> 02:12:31.710

YOU YOU KNOW TO TO ADDRESS THREE

02:12:45.424 --> 02:12:45.824
THINGS REALLY VOLUME.

02:12:45.891 --> 02:12:46.858
THE NUMBER STUDENTS GENERAL

02:12:46.925 --> 02:12:47.125
VELOCITY.

02:12:47.192 --> 02:12:48.593
HOW FAST YOU GET THEM THROUGH

02:12:48.660 --> 02:12:50.295
AND ALSO YOU KNOW WE TALK ABOUT

02:12:50.362 --> 02:12:51.563
BUDGET UNDER VERY?

02:12:51.630 --> 02:12:54.199
TIGHT BUDGET CONSTRAINTS JUST

02:12:54.266 --> 02:12:56.034
ONE CONCERN I WANT 2% IS.

02:12:56.101 --> 02:12:57.736
I THINK WE'VE DONE A GOOD YEAH I

02:12:57.803 --> 02:13:00.772
I WANNA SHOULD TO ANY POTENTIAL

02:13:00.839 --> 02:13:02.407
STUDENT BY THIS DEMAND THAT THEY

02:13:02.474 --> 02:13:04.309
DO IT IN FOUR YEARS.

02:13:04.376 --> 02:13:05.510
BECAUSE THAT'S NOT FOR EVERY

02:13:05.577 --> 02:13:06.812
STUDENT IT WASN'T FOR ME IT TOOK

02:13:06.878 --> 02:13:08.313
ME.

02:13:08.380 --> 02:13:09.715
SEVEN RIGHT FIVE THE COMMUNITY

02:13:09.781 --> 02:13:12.684
COLLEGE TO TO THE CSU --

02:13:12.751 --> 02:13:14.252
YOU KNOW THAT'S I JUST HOPE THAT

02:13:14.319 --> 02:13:16.254
WE'RE NOT BUYING INTO THAT JERRY

02:13:16.321 --> 02:13:17.889
BROWN MANTRA THAT EVERY.

02:13:17.956 --> 02:13:18.857
PERSON THAT'S WHERE THIS CAME

02:13:18.924 --> 02:13:20.659
FROM LET'S BE HONEST AND THAT

02:13:20.726 --> 02:13:22.327
WAS HIS LIFE EXPERIENCE.

02:13:22.394 --> 02:13:24.162
RIGHT HE HAD --

02:13:24.229 --> 02:13:25.564
HE HAD THE ABILITY TO DO THAT

02:13:25.630 --> 02:13:27.099
GIVEN YOU KNOW WHAT GOD GAVE HIM

02:13:27.165 --> 02:13:28.333
AND AND SOME MORE TO GET THROUGH

02:13:28.400 --> 02:13:29.501
VERY QUICKLY.

02:13:29.568 --> 02:13:32.137
AND AND I THINK THAT.

02:13:32.204 --> 02:13:34.005
THE DEMAND THAT WE DO THAT IN

02:13:34.072 --> 02:13:35.107
THAT EVERY STUDENT DO THAT I

02:13:35.173 --> 02:13:36.641
THINK SAID CAN IMPOSE OUR VALUES

02:13:36.708 --> 02:13:37.642
ON THEM.

02:13:37.709 --> 02:13:39.344
BECAUSE STUDENTS HAVE A VARIETY

02:13:39.411 --> 02:13:41.513
OF LIFE EXPERIENCES I COME FROM

02:13:41.580 --> 02:13:42.414
HIGH SCHOOL.

02:13:42.481 --> 02:13:43.782
WHERE A LOT OF OUR KIDS ARE

02:13:43.849 --> 02:13:45.283
ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNERS THEIR

02:13:45.350 --> 02:13:47.519
THEIR AYE LOW INCOME POPULATION

02:13:47.586 --> 02:13:48.186
GREAT KIDS SOME OF GREAT

02:13:48.253 --> 02:13:49.254
CHALLENGES?

02:13:49.321 --> 02:13:50.989
AND WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WERE

02:13:51.056 --> 02:13:52.491
ACCOMMODATING THERE NEEDS.

02:13:52.557 --> 02:13:53.825
TO AND NOT JUST TELLING THEM

02:13:53.892 --> 02:13:55.127
WHAT THEY NEED TO DO BECAUSE

02:13:55.193 --> 02:13:55.861
THEY HAVE A VARIETY OF

02:13:55.927 --> 02:13:59.931
CIRCUMSTANCES A VARIETY DEMANDS --

02:13:59.998 --> 02:14:01.066
DEMANDS YOU KNOW FROM THE HOME

02:14:01.133 --> 02:14:03.869
FRONT WHERE THEY THEY MIGHT BE

02:14:03.935 --> 02:14:05.504
FINANCIALLY MIGHT HAVE KIDS.

02:14:05.570 --> 02:14:06.772
AND I I WANNA MAKE SURE THAT

02:14:06.838 --> 02:14:08.407
WHEN I LEAVING THEM OUT TO DRY

02:14:08.473 --> 02:14:10.442
ARE NOT INVITING THEM IN. TO

02:14:10.509 --> 02:14:12.611
FURTHER AT THEIR EDUCATION I I

02:14:12.677 --> 02:14:13.545
KNOW YOU AGREE WITH ME BUT I

02:14:13.612 --> 02:14:15.280
THINK THE EVEN THIS COMMITTEE

02:14:15.347 --> 02:14:16.915
REALLY NEEDS TO THINK ABOUT THAT.

02:14:16.982 --> 02:14:17.883
YOU KNOW PROBABLY THE UC

02:14:17.949 --> 02:14:18.984
STUDENTS PROBABLY VERY WELL

02:14:19.050 --> 02:14:20.585
GEARED TO DO IT FOR YEARS ON

02:14:20.652 --> 02:14:21.753
AVERAGE AND IT'S IT'S PRETTY

02:14:21.820 --> 02:14:22.954
MUCH HAPPEN NOW.

02:14:23.021 --> 02:14:24.756
THAT WHEN WE GO TO THE TO THE TO

02:14:24.823 --> 02:14:26.892
THE TO THE TO THE TO THE CSU NOT

02:14:26.958 --> 02:14:28.860
SO MUCH BECAUSE THEY BRING YOU

02:14:28.927 --> 02:14:29.594
KNOW PROBABLY MORE LIFE

02:14:29.661 --> 02:14:30.228
EXPERIENCE I'LL BE BLUNT WITH

02:14:30.295 --> 02:14:30.562
YOU.

02:14:30.629 --> 02:14:32.230
AND THEN CERTAINLY ON THE

02:14:32.297 --> 02:14:33.999
COMMUNITY COLLEGE FRIENDS I JUST

02:14:34.065 --> 02:14:35.434
DOES THIS COMMITTEE COLLEGE WHO

02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.134
ARE AS IS COMMITTEE MOVES TOWARD.

02:14:36.201 --> 02:14:38.870
I THINK WE WE NEED --

02:14:38.937 --> 02:14:41.640
TO REALLY THINK ABOUT DIVERSITY

02:14:41.706 --> 02:14:43.975
WITH A LOT OF DIVERSE SITUATIONS

02:14:44.042 --> 02:14:46.011
AND NOT EVERY STUDENT COMES OUT

02:14:46.077 --> 02:14:47.379
AT EIGHTEEN AND IT'S GONNA KNOCK

02:14:47.446 --> 02:14:49.014
IT OUT IN FOUR YEARS AND QUITE

02:14:49.080 --> 02:14:50.582
FRANKLY MAYBE THEY SHOULD.

02:14:50.649 --> 02:14:52.083
SO WE JUST NEED TO KEEP AVENUES

02:14:52.150 --> 02:14:53.351
OPEN FOR THEM AS WELL NUMBER

02:14:53.418 --> 02:14:55.287
DONALD I JUST WANT TO SAY THANK

02:14:55.353 --> 02:14:57.088
YOU FOR THAT I I THINK MY

02:14:57.155 --> 02:14:59.491
RESPONSE TO TWO MEMBERS SEEM

02:14:59.558 --> 02:15:00.492
LAME Là MORE ABOUT THE

02:15:00.559 --> 02:15:04.396
DISTRIBUTION CURVE IS EXACTLY

02:15:04.463 --> 02:15:04.596
RIGHT.

02:15:04.663 --> 02:15:07.599
NO THERE'S A FAMILY I KNOW WHO'S

02:15:07.666 --> 02:15:09.167
OUR RUNNER VERY SUCCESSFUL

02:15:09.234 --> 02:15:10.769
WEALTH BUSINESS IN SEAL BEACH.

02:15:10.836 --> 02:15:12.904
AND THEY ONLY HIRE CAL STATE

02:15:12.971 --> 02:15:15.273
STUDENTS WHO'VE TAKEN AT LEAST

02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:15.574
SIX YEARS --

02:15:15.640 --> 02:15:17.742
HONORED AGREE.

02:15:17.809 --> 02:15:19.177
AND THE REASON THEY DO THAT IS

02:15:19.244 --> 02:15:20.579
THOSE STUDENTS HAVE GREAT.

02:15:20.645 --> 02:15:22.647
THEY HAVE PERSEVERANCE THEY HAVE

02:15:22.714 --> 02:15:24.316
A DREAM IN A WILLING TO WORK

02:15:24.382 --> 02:15:25.784
HARD AND THEY HAVE MORE LIFE

02:15:25.851 --> 02:15:27.419
EXPERIENCE.

02:15:27.486 --> 02:15:28.920
AND SO YOU KNOW THE STUDENT BODY

02:15:28.987 --> 02:15:30.755
IS NOT A MONOLITH. ONE SIZE

02:15:30.822 --> 02:15:32.157
DOESN'T FIT ALL.

02:15:32.224 --> 02:15:34.125
AND IS MANY PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO

02:15:34.192 --> 02:15:37.095
ACTUALLY PREFER STUDENTS WHO'VE.

02:15:37.162 --> 02:15:37.696
GONE THROUGH SOME MORE BEFORE

02:15:37.762 --> 02:15:38.663
THEY'RE READY.

02:15:38.730 --> 02:15:41.266
TO AND THEY HAVE FANTASTIC

02:15:41.333 --> 02:15:41.833
SUCCESS WITH THAT SO TO YOUR

02:15:41.900 --> 02:15:43.301
POINT.

02:15:43.368 --> 02:15:45.070
IF I CAN ADD TO THAT INSTANTLY

02:15:45.136 --> 02:15:45.704
MOVING TO YOUR DISTRICT MEMBER

02:15:45.770 --> 02:15:47.806
O'DONNELL I COULD PROBABLY SAY

02:15:47.873 --> 02:15:48.406
THIS NOW.

02:15:48.473 --> 02:15:54.246
BUT JUST REPRESENTATION WITHOUT

02:15:54.312 --> 02:15:56.181
NO DOUBT IN MY IN FLORIDA.

02:15:56.248 --> 02:15:58.750
BUT BUT I WE CERTAINLY DON'T

02:15:58.817 --> 02:16:00.452
DISAGREE WITH THAT POINT OF VIEW

02:16:00.519 --> 02:16:03.388
AND AND YOU AND I BOTH HAD I'M A

02:16:03.455 --> 02:16:05.190
COLLEGE EXPERIENCE THAT.

02:16:05.257 --> 02:16:07.025
LASTED MORE THAN FOUR YEARS AND

02:16:07.092 --> 02:16:08.126
WITH THAT THE COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:16:08.193 --> 02:16:09.461
IN THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA

02:16:09.528 --> 02:16:13.198
IRVINE I WOULDN'T BE HERE TODAY --

02:16:13.265 --> 02:16:14.199
BUT WHAT WE WE ARE CONCERNED

02:16:14.266 --> 02:16:15.600
ABOUT [inaudible]

02:16:15.667 --> 02:16:19.938
OUR EITHER.

02:16:20.005 --> 02:16:21.773
DESIGN ISSUES WITHIN OUR COLLEGE

02:16:21.840 --> 02:16:24.442
OR ACCESS TO FINANCIAL AID TO

02:16:24.509 --> 02:16:25.777
STUDENTS DON'T HAVE.

02:16:25.844 --> 02:16:28.213
THAT CREATES A SITUATION WHERE

02:16:28.280 --> 02:16:30.282
IT TAKES THEM LONGER THAN.

02:16:30.348 --> 02:16:32.951
THEY WOULD OTHERWISE WANT --

02:16:33.018 --> 02:16:34.319
TO IN SO --

02:16:34.386 --> 02:16:36.021
IF A STUDENT NEEDS TO TAKE FIVE

02:16:36.087 --> 02:16:37.389
YEARS TO TAKE SIX YEARS WE'RE

02:16:37.455 --> 02:16:39.257
GOING TO CONTINUE TO BE THERE

02:16:39.324 --> 02:16:39.858
FOR THEM AND DO EVERYTHING WE

02:16:39.925 --> 02:16:40.625
CAN.

02:16:40.692 --> 02:16:42.160
IN OUR POWER TO HELP THEM GET TO

02:16:42.227 --> 02:16:43.261
THEIR EDUCATIONAL GOALS QUICKLY

02:16:43.328 --> 02:16:44.696
AS POSSIBLE.

02:16:44.763 --> 02:16:46.531
BUT IT SHOULDN'T BE BECAUSE OF

02:16:46.598 --> 02:16:49.734
THE ARTIFICIAL OR ARBITRARY OF

02:16:49.801 --> 02:16:51.970
THINGS THAT WE DO AS COLLEGES.

02:16:52.037 --> 02:16:53.872
THAT PREVENT THEM FROM GETTING

02:16:53.939 --> 02:16:55.073
TO THAT EDUCATIONAL GOALS

02:16:55.140 --> 02:16:56.775
QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT IS

02:16:56.841 --> 02:16:58.743
THE ONLY THING I'D SAY IN

02:16:58.810 --> 02:16:59.711
ADDITION IS.

02:16:59.778 --> 02:17:01.012
A YOU KNOW SOME STUDENTS WANT TO

02:17:01.079 --> 02:17:02.380
FINISH AND SOME STUDENTS NEED TO

THAT IS OUT FIFTY MILLION

02:17:55.100 --> 02:17:56.568
DOLLARS IS ALLOCATED IN THE

02:17:56.635 --> 02:17:58.136

THE BENCHMARK FOR ENROLLING IN

02:21:09.594 --> 02:21:11.329
STATE STUDENTS UNDER THE MASTER

02:21:11.396 --> 02:21:13.498
PLAN THE UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

02:21:13.565 --> 02:21:15.700
PERCENT IS TO ENROLL TWELVE AND

02:21:15.767 --> 02:21:16.801
A HALF PERCENT OF THE FROM THE

02:21:16.868 --> 02:21:18.770
TOP TWELVE AND A HALF PERCENT OF

02:21:18.837 --> 02:21:20.505
HIGH SCHOOL GRADUATES AND WE'RE

02:21:20.572 --> 02:21:23.007
TAKING FROM THE TOP.

02:21:23.074 --> 02:21:26.244
OF THIRTEEN POINTS. THREE YEARS

02:21:26.311 --> 02:21:27.579
6% -- BUT

02:21:27.645 --> 02:21:29.681
WELL WELL BEYOND --

02:21:29.747 --> 02:21:31.449
THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE MASTER

02:21:31.516 --> 02:21:34.652
PLAN -- WE

02:21:34.719 --> 02:21:38.089
ARE OVER AND ROLLED BECAUSE THE

02:21:38.156 --> 02:21:39.824
OUR YIELD FROM OFFERS OF

02:21:39.891 --> 02:21:41.993
ADMISSIONS HAS BEEN HIGHER THAN

02:21:42.060 --> 02:21:43.661
ANTICIPATED THERE'S A GREAT

02:21:43.728 --> 02:21:45.830
DEMAND TO COME TO THE UNIVERSITY

02:21:45.897 --> 02:21:47.365
CALIFORNIA --

02:21:47.432 --> 02:21:49.400
TO GET A UNIVERSITY CALIFORNIA

02:21:49.467 --> 02:21:51.436
DEGREE --

02:21:51.502 --> 02:21:56.140
AND WHAT WE WHAT WE HAVEN'T BEEN

02:21:56.207 --> 02:21:58.376
ABLE TO DO OVER THE LAST FEW

02:21:58.443 --> 02:21:59.911
YEARS AND I THINK PART OF IT IS

02:21:59.978 --> 02:22:02.680
BECAUSE WE HAVE THIS MISMATCH.

02:22:02.747 --> 02:22:03.615
BETWEEN WHEN --

02:22:03.681 --> 02:22:07.218
THE LEGISLATURE SETS THE BUDGET.

02:22:07.285 --> 02:22:10.722
AND WHEN WE ACTUALLY AND ADMIT

02:22:10.788 --> 02:22:11.923
STUDENTS SO WERE.

02:22:11.990 --> 02:22:15.460
SO YOU'RE SETTING A BUDGET FOR

02:22:15.527 --> 02:22:16.928
NINETEEN TWENTY NOW --

02:22:16.995 --> 02:22:19.130
AND THOSE ADMISSION DECISIONS

02:22:19.197 --> 02:22:20.698
ARE ALREADY BEING MADE.

02:22:20.765 --> 02:22:22.166
WE REALLY SHOULD BE TALING

02:22:22.233 --> 02:22:25.470
ABOUT ENROLLMENT HERE.

02:22:25.536 --> 02:22:26.271
FOR TWENTY TWENTY ONE IF YOU

02:22:26.337 --> 02:22:28.740
REALLY WANT TO BE ABLE --

02:22:28.806 --> 02:22:29.807
TO TO GIVE US --

02:22:29.874 --> 02:22:33.645
TARGETS BIG IS PART SCIENCE AND

02:22:33.711 --> 02:22:35.880
IT'S PART PART AND WE HAVE

02:22:35.947 --> 02:22:38.316
MODELS AND WE TRY --

02:22:38.383 --> 02:22:39.717
TO IN ROLE THE NUMBER THAT WE

02:22:39.784 --> 02:22:41.953
THINK WE'LL GET FUNDING.

02:22:42.020 --> 02:22:44.989
FOR BUT BECAUSE OF THE DEMAND.

02:22:45.056 --> 02:22:46.557
WE JUST HAVE BEEN OVERRULED THE

02:22:46.624 --> 02:22:48.393
LAST FEW YEARS.

02:22:48.459 --> 02:22:51.262
RABBIT CSU HANDLES THAT ISSUE

02:22:51.329 --> 02:22:53.231
ZERO WEIGHTLESS SYSTEM RIGHT AND

02:22:53.298 --> 02:22:55.366
THEY THEY TURN AWAY STUDENTS AND

02:22:55.433 --> 02:22:56.401
BUT ESSENTIALLY COME BACK TO US

02:22:56.467 --> 02:22:58.102
IT MAY REVISE AND SAY HEY HERE'S

02:22:58.169 --> 02:22:59.170
WHO WE BLOOD IN.

02:22:59.237 --> 02:23:01.072
AND WE'VE GOT AN ESTABLISHED

02:23:01.139 --> 02:23:02.373
NUMBER FOR ENROLLMENT WELL WE

02:23:02.440 --> 02:23:03.808
FUND WE'VE TRIED THAT OVER THE

02:23:03.875 --> 02:23:07.512
LAST FEW YEARS ON SUCCESSFULLY.

02:23:07.578 --> 02:23:09.080
WELL OF THE WORKS WITH CSU I

02:23:09.147 --> 02:23:10.248
DON'T REALLY SEE WHY IT WOULDN'T

02:23:10.315 --> 02:23:11.950
WORK IN THE UC SYSTEM BUT I

02:23:12.016 --> 02:23:12.984
THINK IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE

02:23:13.051 --> 02:23:14.852
HAVE TO I MEAN LET'S LET'S SEE

02:23:14.919 --> 02:23:15.420
SOME THE NECESSARY NEEDS TO

02:23:15.486 --> 02:23:17.121
CONSIDER.

02:23:17.188 --> 02:23:19.457
AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS CAPACITY

02:23:19.524 --> 02:23:20.258
WHAT DO WE KNOW.

02:23:20.325 --> 02:23:22.093
WHERE WE ARE AT CAPACITY IN THE

02:23:22.160 --> 02:23:23.594
UC SYSTEM?

02:23:23.661 --> 02:23:25.496
A WHICH CAMPUSES HAVE CAPACITY

02:23:25.563 --> 02:23:26.698
TO GROW.

02:23:26.764 --> 02:23:27.999
WE STILL DON'T HAVE AS SEEMS

02:23:28.066 --> 02:23:28.933
LIKE WE STILL DON'T HAVE THAT

02:23:29.000 --> 02:23:30.668
INFORMATION IS THAT SOMETHING

02:23:30.735 --> 02:23:32.170
THAT YOU CAN SHARE WITH US TODAY.

02:23:32.236 --> 02:23:33.938
SO THE DIFFERENT CAMPUSES HAVE

02:23:34.005 --> 02:23:34.739
DIFFERENT --

02:23:34.806 --> 02:23:36.874
CAPACITY AND AND DIFFERENT

02:23:36.941 --> 02:23:38.476
POTENTIAL FOR GROWTH --

02:23:38.543 --> 02:23:41.079
SOME OF THE CAMP --

02:23:41.145 --> 02:23:43.881
A UC BERKELEY ARE VERY

02:23:43.948 --> 02:23:45.049
CONSTRAINED THEY'RE CONSTRAINED

02:23:45.116 --> 02:23:47.452
GEOGRAPHICALLY --

02:23:47.518 --> 02:23:49.420
AMONGST OTHER THINGS OTHER

02:23:49.487 --> 02:23:51.856
CAMPUSES CAN CONTINUE TO GROW

02:23:51.923 --> 02:23:54.258
MERCED IS GROWING RIVERSIDE IS

02:23:54.325 --> 02:23:55.093
GROWING --

02:23:55.159 --> 02:23:58.296
UC SAN DIEGO IS GROWING --

02:23:58.363 --> 02:24:00.164
AND SO.

02:24:00.231 --> 02:24:02.967
WE WE CAN PROVIDE THE MEMBERS OF

02:24:03.034 --> 02:24:05.036
THE COMMITTEE WITH WHERE WE SEE

02:24:05.103 --> 02:24:08.206
THE GROWTH OCCURRING ACROSS THE

02:24:08.272 --> 02:24:10.975
UC CAMPUSES.

02:24:11.042 --> 02:24:12.910
WELL IN THE END JUST JUST FOR ME

02:24:12.977 --> 02:24:14.345

ISSUES THAT I KNOW OF HAVE

02:24:23.755 --> 02:24:26.324
CONTINUALLY COME UP --

02:24:26.391 --> 02:24:28.693
AND YEAH SO FOR ME YOU KNOW --

02:24:28.760 --> 02:24:30.094
IT'S HARD FOR ME TO GO THROUGH A

02:24:30.161 --> 02:24:31.896
BUDGET AND SAY AND JUST CONTINUE

02:25:31.122 --> 02:25:32.090
MAKE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE DO WE

KNOW HOW MANY THIS IS HAVE CHILD

02:25:35.159 --> 02:25:37.795
CARE FACILITIES --

02:25:37.862 --> 02:25:40.431
AND WOULDCSU BE LOOKING AT

02:25:40.498 --> 02:25:42.667
UTILIZING THE FUNNY FOR DEFERRED

02:25:42.733 --> 02:25:44.001
MAINTENANCE.

02:25:44.068 --> 02:25:46.270
OR FOR THE EXPANSION OF CHILD

02:25:46.337 --> 02:25:48.473
CARE FACILITIES IN A BECAUSE AS

02:25:48.539 --> 02:25:49.006
YOU SAID WE HAVE PEOPLE OF

02:25:49.073 --> 02:25:49.774
DIFFERENT.

02:25:49.841 --> 02:25:51.909
VARIOUS LIFE EXPERIENCES

02:25:51.976 --> 02:25:54.078
ATTENDING SCHOOLS AND YES IS ONE

02:25:54.145 --> 02:25:55.113
OF THE ISSUES THAT COMES UP.

02:25:55.179 --> 02:25:56.814
SO MEMBER GALLAGHER THANK YOU

02:25:56.881 --> 02:25:58.149
FOR THAT QUESTION --

02:25:58.216 --> 02:26:00.017
ALL OF OUR CAMPUSES HAT WITH THE

02:26:00.084 --> 02:26:02.420
EXCEPTION OF ONE HAVE SOME

02:26:02.487 --> 02:26:04.155
WEATHER TO CHILD CARE CENTER OR

02:26:04.222 --> 02:26:06.591
SOME WAY. TO PROVIDE A CHILD

02:26:06.657 --> 02:26:09.494
CARE FOR OUR STUDENTS IN SOME

02:26:09.560 --> 02:26:11.496
PLACES ARE EMPLOYEES --

02:26:11.562 --> 02:26:13.764
BUT TWO THIRDS OF THOSE ARE

02:26:13.831 --> 02:26:16.567
ACTUALLY DONE ON A SELF SUPPORT

02:26:16.634 --> 02:26:18.302
BASIS -- OR

02:26:18.369 --> 02:26:19.237
AN ENTERPRISE ONE ORIGINAL

02:26:19.303 --> 02:26:20.138
REASONS REALLY NOT STATE

02:26:20.204 --> 02:26:22.707
FACILITIES OR STATE RESOURCES

02:26:22.773 --> 02:26:24.909
SUPPORTING THE STAFF THAT WORK

02:26:24.976 --> 02:26:25.476
THERE.

02:26:25.543 --> 02:26:27.345
SO THE THE REMAINING ONE THIRD

02:26:27.411 --> 02:26:30.715
HAVE OF CHILDCARE PROGRAMS THAT

02:26:30.781 --> 02:26:32.083
ARE TIED IN WITH OUR ACADEMIC

02:26:32.150 --> 02:26:33.885
PROGRAMS OR EARLY CHILDHOOD

02:26:33.951 --> 02:26:36.254
EDUCATORS MAY GO AS LEARNING

02:26:36.320 --> 02:26:38.389
PROCESS TO WORK WITH THESE

02:26:38.456 --> 02:26:38.990
YOUNGSTERS IN THE CHILD CARE

02:26:39.056 --> 02:26:39.724
CENTER.

02:26:39.790 --> 02:26:41.492
SO WE'RE IN THE PROCESS THEN OF

02:26:41.559 --> 02:26:43.361
TAKING A LOOK AT THOSE THAT --

02:26:43.427 --> 02:26:45.663
OF FALL UNDER THE STATE'S

02:26:45.730 --> 02:26:47.632
INVESTMENT.

02:26:47.698 --> 02:26:49.333
CAPABILITY TO SEE TO WHAT EXTENT

02:26:49.400 --> 02:26:50.368
DEFERRED MAINTENANCE OR

02:26:50.434 --> 02:26:51.969
EXPANSION THOSE FACILITIES ARE

02:26:52.036 --> 02:26:52.837
NECESSARY.

02:26:52.904 --> 02:26:54.138
SO I THINK THAT IS A WORK IN

02:26:54.205 --> 02:26:55.173
PROGRESS WILL HAVE A BETTER

02:26:55.239 --> 02:26:56.974
ANSWER FOR YOU BEFORE YOU GET TO

02:26:57.041 --> 02:26:58.843

PROCESS SO HERE IN THE SPRING

02:26:59.944 --> 02:27:01.712
WE'RE DOING AN INVENTORY ON THE

02:27:01.779 --> 02:27:02.947
STATE.

02:27:03.014 --> 02:27:05.183
CONTROL PARTS OF THE I WOULD

02:27:05.249 --> 02:27:06.817
JUST SAY THAT THE THE MAJORITY

02:27:06.884 --> 02:27:08.553
OF THE TWO HUNDRED FORTY SEVEN

02:27:08.619 --> 02:27:09.754
MILLION DOLLAR WILL BE GOING TO

02:27:09.820 --> 02:27:11.856
THE ACADEMIC SIDE OF THE CAMPUS --

02:27:11.923 --> 02:27:13.824
BUT I CAN'T GIVE YOU A NUMBER

02:27:13.891 --> 02:27:15.326
YET FOR THE CHILD CARE PEAS --

02:27:15.393 --> 02:27:17.662
IT IS IMPORTANT AGAIN WITH A

02:27:17.728 --> 02:27:19.030
POINTED MEMBER O'DONNELL AND

02:27:19.096 --> 02:27:20.798

02:27:24.101 --> 02:27:25.570
ADDITION TO GOING TO SCHOOL.

02:27:25.636 --> 02:27:27.205
THAT OF THESE ARE WAYS IN WHICH

02:27:27.271 --> 02:27:31.142
WE CAN HELP REDUCE BARRIERS AND

02:27:31.209 --> 02:27:32.276
SO THEY GET TO THEIR CLASS.

02:27:32.343 --> 02:27:34.212
EXETER SO WE'LL BE GETTING MORE

02:27:34.278 --> 02:27:36.113
REFINED DATA TO YOU BUT OVER ON

02:27:36.180 --> 02:27:38.950

FORTY SEVEN A SMALL PIECE OF IT.

02:27:40.484 --> 02:27:42.620
BUT IMMEASURABLE AN IMPORTANT

02:27:42.687 --> 02:27:42.954
PIECE OKAY.

02:27:43.020 --> 02:27:44.255

METRIC AGAIN.

02:28:00.671 --> 02:28:01.505
ARE THERE ANY OUTCOME

02:28:01.572 --> 02:28:02.840
MEASUREMENTS CURRENTLY TO

02:28:02.907 --> 02:28:04.208
INDICATE THAT THE PROMISE

02:28:04.275 --> 02:28:07.011
PROGRAM IS TO FILL IN ITS GOAL

02:28:07.078 --> 02:28:07.311
[inaudible]

02:28:07.378 --> 02:28:10.615
WELL IT'S AS FAR AS A CALIFORNIA

02:28:10.681 --> 02:28:12.917
COLLEGE FROM IS IT'S DIFFICULT

02:28:12.984 --> 02:28:14.986
TO BEGIN TO SEE THE OUTCOMES

02:28:15.052 --> 02:28:17.321
BECAUSE IT WASN'T UNTIL THIS

02:28:17.388 --> 02:28:18.489
LAST BUDGET.

02:28:18.556 --> 02:28:22.793
THAT THE AB NINETEEN WAS FUND.

02:28:22.860 --> 02:28:25.029
SO THIS IS REALLY THE FIRST YEAR

02:28:25.096 --> 02:28:26.364
OF IMPLEMENTATION NOW.

02:28:26.430 --> 02:28:27.898
WHAT I CAN TELL YOU?

02:28:27.965 --> 02:28:29.634
IS WHERE COLLEGE PROMISE

02:28:29.700 --> 02:28:30.601
INITIATIVES HAVE BEEN

02:28:30.668 --> 02:28:32.136
IMPLEMENTED WHETHER IN LONG

02:28:32.203 --> 02:28:35.973
BEACH OR IN OF INTER --

02:28:36.040 --> 02:28:39.076
OR IN THE INLAND EMPIRE OR IN

02:28:39.143 --> 02:28:40.578
THE CENTRAL VALLEY WE'VE SEEN

02:28:40.645 --> 02:28:42.647
TREMENDOUS SUCCESS IN TERMS OF

02:28:42.713 --> 02:28:44.181
INCREASING THE NUMBER.

02:28:44.248 --> 02:28:45.850
OF LOCAL HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS

02:28:45.916 --> 02:28:48.252
THAT ATTEND A COMMUNITY COLLEGE

02:28:48.319 --> 02:28:49.854
OR THEIR CSU WE SEEN A

02:28:49.920 --> 02:28:51.422
SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE

02:28:51.489 --> 02:28:52.790
AMOUNT OF STUDENTS THAT

02:28:52.857 --> 02:28:53.958
SEAMLESSLY TRANSFER TO THEIR

02:28:54.025 --> 02:28:55.626
LOCAL CSU AND THAT THE

02:28:55.693 --> 02:28:56.961
GRADUATION RATES OF THOSE

02:28:57.028 --> 02:28:58.462
TRANSFER STUDENTS CONTINUES TO

02:28:58.529 --> 02:29:00.197
INCREASE.

02:29:00.264 --> 02:29:01.766
WE'VE SEEN THAT --

02:29:01.832 --> 02:29:05.069
THIS IN THOSE COMMUNITIES

02:29:05.136 --> 02:29:07.405
BECAUSE THEY CAN SEE THAT THERE

02:29:07.471 --> 02:29:08.873
DOLLARS ARE GOING DIRECTLY TO

02:29:08.939 --> 02:29:10.941
COVERING THE COST OF ATTENDING

02:29:11.008 --> 02:29:12.743
COLLEGE NOT THE COST OF TUITION.

02:29:12.810 --> 02:29:14.078
SO UNDER THOSE MEASURES WE WHICH

02:29:14.145 --> 02:29:16.213
WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE

02:29:16.280 --> 02:29:17.248
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISE WILL

02:29:17.315 --> 02:29:19.016

TRACKING OKAY THESE ARE STUDENTS

02:29:30.561 --> 02:29:32.063
THAT OTHERWISE WOULD HAVE

02:29:32.129 --> 02:29:33.097
ATTENDED --

02:29:33.164 --> 02:29:34.765

DOING IT BECAUSE OF THE PROMISE

02:29:37.468 --> 02:29:38.869
PROGRAM AND THEN TRACKING.

02:29:38.936 --> 02:29:41.405
OKAY AND DO THEY GET TO WRITE.

02:29:41.472 --> 02:29:43.841
THE CREDENTIAL OR OTHERWISE

02:29:43.908 --> 02:29:45.109
RIGHT --

02:29:45.176 --> 02:29:46.410
JUST SO THAT WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE

02:29:46.477 --> 02:29:47.845

YEAH FOR FILLING RIGHT AT THE

02:29:51.649 --> 02:29:53.484
POLICY GOAL THAT I THINK WAS

02:29:53.551 --> 02:29:55.920
BEHIND THAT IN THE FIRST PLACE.

02:29:55.986 --> 02:29:57.722
WELL I'D SAY WE ALREADY HAVE

02:29:57.788 --> 02:29:58.989
SEVERAL MEASURES IN PLACE --

02:29:59.056 --> 02:30:02.059
THAT WE ARE --

02:30:02.126 --> 02:30:03.728
THAT I'VE MENTIONED SO FOR

02:30:03.794 --> 02:30:05.129
EXAMPLE --

02:30:05.196 --> 02:30:06.797
DECREASING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP

02:30:06.864 --> 02:30:08.499
THAT EXISTS WE THINK THAT.

02:30:08.566 --> 02:30:10.201
IF IMPLEMENTED WELL THE

02:30:10.267 --> 02:30:12.069
CALIFORNIA COLLEGE PROMISED --

02:30:12.136 --> 02:30:13.971
INITIATIVE WILL --

02:30:14.038 --> 02:30:15.840
ADVANCES EFFORTS BECAUSE FOR A

02:30:15.906 --> 02:30:17.508
COLLEGE TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR THOSE

02:30:17.575 --> 02:30:19.243
FUNDS THEY HAVE TO BE PUT INTO

02:30:19.310 --> 02:30:20.711
PLACE THE GUIDED PATHWAYS

02:30:20.778 --> 02:30:22.113
FRAMEWORK THEY HAVE TO BE CLOSE

02:30:22.179 --> 02:30:23.347
THE ACHIEVEMENT GAPS AND HAVE TO

02:30:23.414 --> 02:30:24.115
BE.

02:30:24.181 --> 02:30:25.783
INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF AID

02:30:25.850 --> 02:30:28.919
THAT GOES TO THOSE FOUR YEAR

02:30:28.986 --> 02:30:30.221
COLLEGE PROMISES PART OF AN

02:30:30.287 --> 02:30:31.756
UMBRELLA OF A NUMBER OF

02:30:31.822 --> 02:30:33.157
INITIATIVES.

02:30:33.224 --> 02:30:35.259
AIMED TO REDUCE THOSE GAPS

02:30:35.326 --> 02:30:37.294
SPECIFICALLY WE WOULD WANT TO

02:30:37.361 --> 02:30:39.663
SEE THE NUMBER OF HIGH SCHOOL

02:30:39.730 --> 02:30:41.065
STUDENTS COMING TO COMMUNITY

02:30:41.132 --> 02:30:42.199
COLLEGE --

02:30:42.266 --> 02:30:43.968
NETTLE INCREASE BY INCREASE IN

02:30:44.034 --> 02:30:45.636
TERMS OF DIVERSITY AN INCREASE

02:30:45.703 --> 02:30:46.937
IN TERMS OF THEIR OUTCOME SO

02:30:47.004 --> 02:30:48.339
THOSE ARE CERTAINLY MEASURES

02:30:48.406 --> 02:30:49.907
THAT WE WOULD ANTICIPATE.

02:30:49.974 --> 02:30:51.709
WOULD INCREASE AND THOSE ARE

02:30:51.776 --> 02:30:53.277
MEASURES THAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR

02:30:53.344 --> 02:30:55.513
RIGHT NOW --

02:30:55.579 --> 02:30:57.348
ACROSS OUR SYSTEM

02:30:57.415 --> 02:30:58.749
WHEN THAT THAT SOME I WOULD LIKE

02:30:58.816 --> 02:30:59.417
YOU KNOW THAT MAYBE WE COULD SEE

02:30:59.483 --> 02:31:00.951
IN SOME FUTURE HEARINGS IS JUST

02:31:01.018 --> 02:31:01.919
HOW THOSE ARE BEING DIRECT AND

02:31:01.986 --> 02:31:03.454
OBVIOUSLY I REALIZE IN THIS IS

02:31:03.521 --> 02:31:06.457
JUST GET ENOUGH THE GROUND --

02:31:06.524 --> 02:31:08.159

02:31:08.225 --> 02:31:09.226
GUYS CAN ALSO BE --

02:31:09.293 --> 02:31:10.728
ACCOUNTABILITY AND IN

02:31:10.795 --> 02:31:12.029
PERFORMANCE AND HOW THE MONEY IS

02:31:12.096 --> 02:31:13.264
ACTUALLY UTILIZE IN ARE WE

02:31:13.330 --> 02:31:14.532

TO RETAIN IN TUITION THE THOSE

02:34:29.193 --> 02:34:30.761
CAMPUSES WOULD HAVE RECEIVE.

02:34:30.828 --> 02:34:32.997
AND DISTRIBUTE THEM SYSTEM WIDE

02:34:33.063 --> 02:34:34.765
TO BASIC NEEDS FOR OUR

02:34:34.832 --> 02:34:35.799
UNDERGRADUATES.

02:34:35.866 --> 02:34:39.503
GOOD SOLUTION.

02:34:39.570 --> 02:34:41.405
I WANT TO ASK ABOUT THE NON

02:34:41.472 --> 02:34:43.440
RESIDENT TUITION WE'RE VERY

02:34:43.507 --> 02:34:45.709
ADVERSE TO INCREASING FEES FOR

02:34:45.776 --> 02:34:47.878
CALIFORNIANS BUT FOR YEAH

02:34:47.945 --> 02:34:50.180
WEALTHY PEOPLE ARE CALIFORNIANS

02:34:50.247 --> 02:34:51.849
SOMETHING WE HAD DIFFERENT

02:34:51.915 --> 02:34:53.317
OPINIONS --

02:34:53.384 --> 02:34:54.852
THERE'S BEEN CONCERN THAT IF WE

02:34:54.918 --> 02:34:56.854
KEEP INCREASING AND NON RESIDENT

02:34:56.920 --> 02:34:57.788
TUITION.

02:34:57.855 --> 02:34:59.890
THERE'D BE A DECLINING PEOPLE

02:34:59.957 --> 02:35:01.425
PLAYING.

02:35:01.492 --> 02:35:03.293
BUT WE'VE WE'VE HAD THESE

02:35:03.360 --> 02:35:05.229
INCREASES I THINK THREE LASTS

02:35:05.295 --> 02:35:07.464
FOR YEARS MAYBE FOR LAST.

02:35:07.531 --> 02:35:09.099
FOUR YEARS AND WE HAVEN'T HAD

02:35:09.166 --> 02:35:11.568
THAT MUCH OF A DECLINE THERE'S A

02:35:11.635 --> 02:35:14.672
BIT OF A DECLINE IN YOU KNOW.

02:35:14.738 --> 02:35:15.272
THERE WAS SPECULATION THAT IT

02:35:15.339 --> 02:35:17.408
WAS THE PRESIDENCY DECLARE WHAT

02:35:17.474 --> 02:35:18.709
HAVE YOU BUT WE WE SEEN IT

02:35:18.776 --> 02:35:20.010
SOMEWHAT FLAT AND SO.

02:35:20.077 --> 02:35:22.680
IS THAT POTENTIALLY ON THE TABLE

02:35:22.746 --> 02:35:25.149
TO CONTINUE.

02:35:25.215 --> 02:35:26.350
TO INDEX THAT.

02:35:26.417 --> 02:35:27.985
FEE AND USE THAT MONEY FOR

02:35:28.052 --> 02:35:29.420
POTENTIALLY CALIFORNIA IN A

02:35:29.486 --> 02:35:32.089
MOMENT YES WE'RE GOING TO BE.

02:35:32.156 --> 02:35:33.824
ASKING THE BOARD OF REGENTS NEXT

02:35:33.891 --> 02:35:36.527
WEEK TO APPROVE A TWO POINT 6%

02:35:36.593 --> 02:35:38.495
INCREASE TO THE NON RESIDENT

02:35:38.562 --> 02:35:40.397
STUDENT TUITION --

02:35:40.464 --> 02:35:41.799
WHICH BASICALLY HOLDS THEM ON

02:35:41.865 --> 02:35:43.600
RESIDENTS IN TUITION FLAT IN

02:35:43.667 --> 02:35:45.469
TERMS OF CONSTANT DOLLARS AND

02:35:45.536 --> 02:35:46.904
INDEXING WOULD BE ANOTHER WAY OF

02:35:46.970 --> 02:35:48.672
LOOKING AT IT.

02:35:48.739 --> 02:35:49.907
BUT THOSE.

02:35:49.973 --> 02:35:54.945
NON RESIDENT STUDENT TUITION --

02:35:55.012 --> 02:35:56.613
TO THE CAMPUS THE ONE I GO.

02:35:56.680 --> 02:35:59.249
TO FIVE AND THEN USE THAT. TO TO

02:35:59.316 --> 02:36:01.085
MAKE SURE WE CAN EXPAND SOME

02:36:01.151 --> 02:36:03.053
MORE SLOTS AT EACH OF THE NINE

02:36:03.120 --> 02:36:04.021
UNDERGRADUATE CAMPUSES ARE

02:36:04.088 --> 02:36:05.355
BECAUSE WE'RE VERY CONSCIOUS

02:36:05.422 --> 02:36:06.790
THAT WE'RE REACHING --

02:36:06.857 --> 02:36:08.425
A PRICE POINT THAT'S MY POINT IS

02:36:08.492 --> 02:36:10.961
WE DID INCREASE A ONE YEAR EIGHT

02:36:11.028 --> 02:36:11.929
ONE YOU'RE.

02:36:11.995 --> 02:36:13.597
FIVE AND WE DIDN'T REALLY HAVE A

02:36:13.664 --> 02:36:14.898
DROP OF PEOPLE STILL CONTINUE TO

02:36:14.965 --> 02:36:18.235
APPLY.

02:36:18.302 --> 02:36:20.537
BUT I THINK IT IS --

02:36:20.604 --> 02:36:22.673
THE RECORD THE RECOMMENDATION

02:36:22.740 --> 02:36:24.608
THAT -- NINE

02:36:24.675 --> 02:36:25.876
RESIDENTS IN TUITION UNDER THE

02:36:25.943 --> 02:36:27.611
TWO POINT 6% PLAN WILL BE GOING

02:36:27.678 --> 02:36:29.379
UP SEVEN HUNDRED AND TWENTY SIX

02:36:29.446 --> 02:36:32.549
DOLLARS IT'LL BE OVER.

02:36:32.616 --> 02:36:34.051
FORTY ONE THOUSAND AT THAT POINT --

02:36:34.118 --> 02:36:36.720

BACK AND TALK TO US ABOUT THAT

02:36:41.425 --> 02:36:42.693
BECAUSE WE THINK THAT THAT --

02:36:42.760 --> 02:36:45.562
WARRANTS FURTHER.

02:36:45.629 --> 02:36:47.464
EVALUATION.

02:36:47.531 --> 02:36:49.266

ENROLLMENT GROWTH WITH SIXTY TWO

02:57:21.797 --> 02:57:23.199
MILLION DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET --

02:57:23.265 --> 02:57:24.266
WE ASK THAT THE GROWTH BE

02:57:24.333 --> 02:57:25.668
MEASURED BY HEAD COUNT INSTEAD

02:57:25.735 --> 02:57:29.238
OF FULL TIME EQUIVALENT STUDENTS --

02:57:29.305 --> 02:57:31.273
THE REASON WE ASK THAT IS A

02:57:31.340 --> 02:57:32.375
COUPLE THINGS --

02:57:32.441 --> 02:57:34.577
ONE REGULARLY WERE TURNING AWAY

02:57:34.643 --> 02:57:35.111
THIRTY THOUSAND QUALIFIED

02:57:35.177 --> 02:57:37.113
STUDENTS FROM THE CSU --

02:57:37.179 --> 02:57:38.948
USING FTP CALCULATIONS ALONE

02:57:39.015 --> 02:57:40.082

02:57:40.149 --> 02:57:42.685

02:57:42.752 --> 02:57:44.220

ENROLLMENT IS NOT THE FUNDING TO

LACK OF RESOURCES MEN'S AND LONG

UNDER THE PROPOSAL THEY ARE NOT --

03:18:43.144 --> 03:18:44.612
WE BELIEVE THAT THE STUDENTS

03:18:44.679 --> 03:18:45.913
SHOULD BE TREATED EQUITABLY AND

03:18:45.980 --> 03:18:47.115
THAT THEY FACE SIMILAR

03:18:47.181 --> 03:18:47.982
CHALLENGES IN COMPLETING THEIR

03:18:48.049 --> 03:18:49.550

SCIENCE STUDENT AT THE

03:19:00.662 --> 03:19:01.996
UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA MERCED.

I'M ALSO AND UNDOCUMENTED

03:19:03.998 --> 03:19:05.600
STUDENT -- I

03:19:05.667 --> 03:19:06.501
THINK THAT THE BIGGEST THING

03:19:06.567 --> 03:19:06.968
THROUGHOUT THIS WHOLE

03:19:07.035 --> 03:19:10.571
CONVERSATION IS THE A BIG NOREEN

03:19:10.638 --> 03:19:12.874
UNDOCUMENTED STUDENTS NOT AB

03:19:12.940 --> 03:19:14.108

IN THE RHETORIC OF NON RESIDENT

03:19:17.011 --> 03:19:19.147

AND SO WITH THE TUITION INCREASE

03:19:27.522 --> 03:19:29.223
AT TARGETS LOW INCOME STUDENTS

03:19:29.290 --> 03:19:31.526
WHO ARE NOT FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO

03:19:31.592 --> 03:19:32.994
QUALIFY FOR AB.

03:19:33.061 --> 03:19:33.861
FIVE FORTY I DON'T THINK THAT

03:19:33.928 --> 03:19:35.530
PAYING NINE HUNDRED DOLLARS

03:19:35.596 --> 03:19:36.931
EXTRA A YEAR --

03:19:36.998 --> 03:19:38.833
IS MUCH TOO MUCH OF A BURDEN ON

03:19:38.900 --> 03:19:40.335
WEALTHIER FAMILIES AND IT IS TO

03:19:40.401 --> 03:19:42.103
A LOWER INCOME UNDOCUMENTED

03:19:42.170 --> 03:19:42.970

03:19:44.405 --> 03:19:46.607
MENTIONED THAT A 5% TUITION

03:19:46.674 --> 03:19:48.176
INCREASE WOULD BE BEST BUT WITH

03:19:48.242 --> 03:19:49.977
LAST YEAR'S TWO POINT 5%

03:19:50.044 --> 03:19:51.312
INCREASE IN THIS YEAR'S PROPOSED

TWO POINT SIX INCREASE THAT'S

03:19:52.613 --> 03:19:54.849
ALREADY A 5% INCREASE WITHIN THE

03:19:54.916 --> 03:19:57.452
PAST TWO YEARS --

03:19:57.518 --> 03:19:58.353
I WILL FIRSTHAND LET YOU ALL

03:19:58.419 --> 03:19:59.754

MEANT TO TRULY OFFER ME.

03:20:07.628 --> 03:20:09.063

03:20:20.775 --> 03:20:22.076
EXTENDS TO MORE THAN THE

03:20:22.143 --> 03:20:24.045
SYMBOLISM OF A DEGREE --

03:20:24.112 --> 03:20:25.546

03:21:23.938 --> 03:21:25.339
FROM THE UC STERN NARRATIVE --

03:21:25.406 --> 03:21:26.574
THE UC STERN ASSOCIATION IS

03:21:26.641 --> 03:21:28.676
UNEQUIVOCALLY OPPOSED TO PLACING

03:21:28.743 --> 03:21:30.211

BOTH OF THESE MEASURES WILL

03:21:34.382 --> 03:21:35.383
DAMAGE THE UC STATUS AS A

03:21:35.450 --> 03:21:36.651

AFFORDABILITY --

03:21:59.340 --> 03:22:00.541
BUT I REALLY DON'T SEE THAT WHEN

03:22:00.608 --> 03:22:01.642
WE CONTINUE TO PUSH FOLKS OUT OF

03:22:01.709 --> 03:22:03.010
THIS INSTITUTION JUST BECAUSE

03:22:03.077 --> 03:22:04.278
THEY DON'T HAVE THE PRIVILEGE OF
