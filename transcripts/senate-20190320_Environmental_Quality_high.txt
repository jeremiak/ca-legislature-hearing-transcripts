FOR LETTING ME DO THIS FIRST BEFORE YOU GO INTO YOUR INFORMATIONAL HEARING I APPRECIATED -- I THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY PRESENT SB ONE TODAY THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKERS DEFENSE ACTIVE. TWENTY NINETEEN SB ONE MAKES FEDERAL BASELINE STANDARDS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL AND WORKER PROTECTION ENFORCEABLE AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW. FOR THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION IN WASHINGTON DC ROLES THEM BACK IT'S BEEN ROUGHLY THREE YEARS AND TWO MONTHS SINCE THE NEW ADMINISTRATION TOOK OFFICE. IN DC AND DURING THAT TIME ACCORDING TO THE NEW YORK TIMES AND NUMEROUS OTHER AUTHORITIES OVER THIRTY FOUR DIFFERENT CLEAN. AIR CLEAN WATER. AN ENDANGERED SPECIES STANDARDS HAVE BEEN WEAKENED OR ELIMINATED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS ADOPTED TO ROLL BACK WATER QUALITY PROTECTIONS LIKE THE WATERS OF THE U. S. RULE ADOPTED UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT. ANOTHER EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS ADOPTED TO ROLL BACK AUTO FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS ADOPTED PURSUANT TO THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR ACT. ANOTHER EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS ADOPTED TO ALLOW IMPORTATION OF IVORY AND OTHER BODY PARTS OF THREATENED SPECIES. SUCH AS ELEPHANTS AND RHINOS AND I WILL REMIND YOU ALLY AB NINETY SIX WAS ONE OF MY MOST FAVORITE PIECES OF LEGISLATION WHICH WAS THE PROTECTION. A AND THE CLOSING THE LOOPHOLE ON BAY HOUSING CALIFORNIA. STILL ANOTHER EXECUTIVE ORDER WAS ADOPTED TO STOP DISCLOSING TOXIC HAZARDS IN WORKPLACES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECTS THE HEALTH OF WORKERS. AND SURPRISINGLY ABSOLUTELY NO ONE THE COLD COLD LOBBYIST NOW AT THE HELM OF THE EPA. OR THE OIL LOBBYIST IN CHARGE OF THE DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR ARE SYSTEMATICALLY. UNDER ENFORCING THE LAWS THAT REMAIN. IN ADDITION AND FOR THE THIRD YEAR IN A ROW THE FEDERAL ADMINISTRATION IS PROPOSED BUDGET BLUEPRINT. THAT WILL REDUCE THE BUDGET OF THE US EPA TO A POINT WHERE THE AGENCY WOULD NO LONGER BE ABLE TO MEANINGFULLY ENFORCE. CLEAN AIR. AND WATER LOSS -- THE LIST GOES ON AND ON SB ONE SIMPLY PROVIDES THAT WHATEVER ACTIONS THE NEW FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MAY TAKE. CALIFORNIA WILL CONTINUE TO ENFORCE THE SAME ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH PUBLIC HEALTH PROTECTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN IN EFFECT FOR YEARS AS A MATTER OF STATE LAW. THE FEDERAL CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER SAFE DRINKING WATER AND ENDANGERED SPECIES AND WORKER PROTECTION ACTS WERE ALL ADOPTED ON A BIPARTISAN BASIS IN THE NINETEEN SEVENTIES. ARE OVER FORTY YEARS AGO SB ONE SIMPLY INSURES NO BACKSLIDING WHEN IT COMES TO THE PROTECTION. OF OUR IRREPLACEABLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATURAL RESOURCES. I THERE IS A BROAD CROSS SECTION OF PUBLIC HEALTH WORKER SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS. THAT SUPPORT THIS LEGISLATION I WOULD AND AND I WANT TO THANK MY COLLEAGUE. SENATOR STERN FOR BEING HERE WITH ME TODAY AS WELL AS A PRINCIPAL CO AUTHOR. YOU WOULD DO ANOTHER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I'M JUST HERE IS THE PRO TEM'S COUNCIL MOSTLY. TRYING TO LITIGATE THE CASE THAT -- WE WISH WE DIDN'T HAVE TO MAKE -- WE GET PUT IN POSITIONS AND WE'VE HAD TO FACE THIS OVER HISTORY WHERE -- THE SORT OF COOPERATIVE FEDERALISM FREE MORE BREAKS DOWN. AND THE ABILITY OF STATE. THE GOVERNING THEIR OWN HEALTH AND SAFETY IS PUT AT RISK. BY FEDERAL ACTION OR IN THIS CASE FEDERAL INACTION. WE RECOGNIZE THAT THERE ARE CHALLENGES TO THIS CONFLICT. AND THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE GONNA HEAR SOME OF THOSE THOSE THOSE -- CONCERNS TODAY. FROM FOLKS WHO ARE ARE WORRIED ABOUT. THAT THAT COLLISION -- BETWEEN OUR ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS IN OUR ABILITY PROTECT OUR HEALTH AND SAFETY OF OUR WORKERS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT AND THEN DID A BROADER. CONSTERNATION AND SO IS HE WITH THE CHAOS COMING OUT OF WASHINGTON. AND SO WHEN YOU HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT. DOESN'T EVEN AGREE WITH THEIR OWN SCIENCE. IS BUSY YOU PUT YOU COME OUT WITH A REPORT FROM AGENCY AND YOU DECIDE ELIMINATE THAT AGENCY BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T THINK IT WAS. DOING THE JOB. THIS BILL SEEKS TO REMEDY THAT -- RISK. IN OUR SYSTEM RIGHT NOW BY. SIMPLY SAYING. AS A STATE. WE'RE GOING TO ENFORCE -- EVERY LAW WITHIN OUR JURISDICTION AND AUTHORITY -- TO MAX MIXED IN FEASIBLE. CONSISTENT WITH WHEE THE LAST ADMINISTRATION LEFT THE SORT OF FEDERAL BASELINE. THERE'S NO ISSUE WITH THE STATE EXERCISING THAT POWER BUT WE HAVEN'T DONE IT IN ORGANIZED MANNER. SO THIS BILL IS IS IS MORE ABOUT AN ORGANIZED APPROACH TO PRESERVE AN ENVIRONMENTAL INTEGRITY AND KIND OF LOOK NO ONE LIKES TALK ABOUT UILDING WALLS HERE. RIGHT BUT WE NEED SOME KIND OF FENCE OR SOME KIND OF INSURANCE POLICY TO MAKE SURE THAT WASHINGTON. AND THE KNOW NOTHING SIGNS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION DOESN'T UNDERCUT OUR ABILITY TO PROTECT OUR PEOPLE AND SO THAT'S THE THAT'S THE LEGAL FRAMEWORK WERE PRESENTING TO ALL HERE TODAY -- WE KNOW IT'S CHALLENGING FOR SOME. TO TO ENGAGE IN THIS SORT OF INTERFACE WITHOUT A PARTISAN TILTS BUT MIND YOU THERE BEEN REPUBLICAN ADMINISTRATIONS. FOR DECADES AND DECADES THAT STILL CARE ABOUT CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER AND A PULL THESE LAWS. THE THE SYSTEMATIC GUIDING AT THE ADMINISTRATIVE ARCHITECTURES WHAT WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT HERE TODAY THAT THERE'S GOING TO BE JUST NO REGULATORY FRAMEWORK LEFT EVEN PROMOTE OF A FREE ECONOMY AND IT A ROBUST MARKET. THE JUST NOTHING LEFT THE CUTS WERE SEEING AT A WASHINGTON OR NOT THERE SO WE'RE GONNA KEEP DOING IT OURSELVES. AND WITH THAT I'D RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOU TO JOIN LEGISLATION. THANK YOU THANK YOU CENTER STERN -- WITNESSES IN SUPPORT. MORNING TURN MEMBERS. WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL I'M HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS AN RTC STRONG SUPPORT AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR SB ONE WHICH IS DESIGNED TO MAKE MAINTAIN CALIFORNIA'S EXISTING ENVIRONMENTAL. PUBLIC HEALTH AND WORKER SAFETY PROTECTIONS AGAINST THE RECKLESS ATTACKS FROM HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION IN DC. AS YOU WELL KNOW CALIFORNIANS ARE ALREADY SUFFERING FROM THE DEVASTATING IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH POOR AIR AND WATER QUALITY. DESPITE INCREASINGLY FREQUENT AN UNPRECEDENTED DISASTERS THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION CONTINUES TO PUSH AN ANTI ENVIRONMENT AGENDA BUT BENEFITS POLLUTERS. AT THE EXPENSE OF OUR NATION'S MOST IMPORTANT ASSETS OUR PEOPLE AND OUR NATURAL RESOURCES. FROM ALLOWING POLLUTION FROM OTHER STATES TO CROSS STATE LINES AT HIGHER LEVELS WITHOUT CONSIDERING THE HELP HEALTH IMPACTS ON FAMILIES AND OUR COMMUNITIES. THE DISMANTLING PROTECTION FROM LOCAL DRINKING WATER SUPPLIES RIVERS AND ESTUARIES. TO ALLOWING MORE TOXIC POLLUTANTS SUCH AS ARSENIC LEAD AND MERCURY THE DESTRUCTION FOR SURFACE WATERS TO QUIETLY PROPOSING TO LITERALLY CHANGE THE DEFINITION OF AMBIENT AIR. TO ALLOW COMPANIES TO CIRCUMVENT AIR POLLUTION CONTROL REQUIREMENTS THE LIST OF FEDERAL THREATS AND ROLL BOX IS BOTH LONG AND DISHEARTENING. SB ONE SIMPLY SET UP A PROCESS FOR SPECIFIED AGENCIES TO REGULARLY ASSESSED CHANGES TO FEDERAL STANDARDS. AND CONSIDER ADOPTING INTO STATE LAW EXISTING BASELINE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS FOR CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER ENDANGERED SPECIES IN DANGER SPECIES WORKER SAFETY AND SAFE DRINKING WATER. CALIFORNIA HAS AN OPPORTUNITY HERE THE BUILDING WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LEADERSHIP AND PUT IN PLACE AND IF IN EVEN STRONGER FIRE WALL AGAINST THE SHORT SIGHTED ATTACKS FROM HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION. THANK YOU ENOUGH FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU. THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING MY NAME'S CAM DELFINO AND I'M THE CALIFORNIA PROGRAM DIRECTOR WITH DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE -- WE HAVE ABOUT TWO HUNDRED AND SEVENTY NINE THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS HERE IN CALIFORNIA -- I WOULD JUST WANT TO ECHO THE COMMENTS FROM MY COLLEAGUE AND THE KEY TO IT THIS IS A VERY IN MANY WAYS STRAIGHTFORWARD AND SIMPLE BILL IT SETS UP A PROCESS. FOR AGENCIES TO DEAL WITH SITUATIONS IN WHICH THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AS OF PROPOSING ARM HAS MOVED FORWARD WITH WEAKENING STANDARDS FOR AIR WATER. OF LABOR AND CAN FOR MY OR AND IT DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING STATE STANDARDS IT JUST SIMPLY ALLOWS THE AGENCIES. TO HAVE AN ORDERLY WAY TO MOVE FORWARD WITH ASSESSING THE IMPACTS OF THE CHANGED OF FEDERAL STANDARDS. AND PUT IN PLACE IF THEY DEEM IT APPROPRIATE -- STATE STANDARDS OF FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES JUST AS A BACKGROUND THERE'S ABOUT SEVENTY SPECIES THAT ARE CURRENTLY NOT LISTED AS THREATENED AND ENDANGERED UNDER THE STATE ACT. I INCLUDING WHALES SEA TURTLES AND EVEN THE SEA OTTER -- AND SO WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE OF RULES MOVING THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT HERE RIGHT NOW TO WEAKEN STANDARDS FOR ENDANGERED SPECIES AND THIS AGAIN WOULD ALLOW THE FISH AND GAME COMMISSION. AN ORDERLY PROCESS TO MOVE FORWARD AND DETERMINE HOW BEST TO THE STATUS OF THOSE WEAKENING STANDARDS AND PROTECT OUR ENDANGERED AND THREATENED SPECIES THANK YOU THANK YOU. ARE THE FOLKS WHO LIKE. TO AN HONOR SUPPORT. MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS CAITLIN VEGA HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA LABOR FEDERATION AND THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL. AND THIS BILL IS INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT TO US BECAUSE WE HAVE SEEN. A STEADY ROLL BACK OF VIRTUALLY EVERY WORKER PROTECTION ON THAT WAS ENACTED UNDER THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION. AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL -- OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF YEARS THRILLED. I'M REGULATORY ROLLBACKS THROUGH EXECUTIVE ACTIONS WE HAVE SEEN -- PROTECTIONS THAT CALIFORNIA WORKERS RELY UPON BECAUSE IT IS A PATCHWORK OF FEDERAL AND STATE REGULATIONS. THAT PROTECTS CALIFORNIA WORKERS ARE MEMBERS RELY ON THERE BEING A FEDERAL BASS LINE AND THEN OUR OUR ABILITY -- TO ADD ON AS NEEDED AT THE STATE LEVEL WHAT WE SEEN AS SO MANY OF THOSE REGULATIONS. IT TAKE AS DECADES TO GET ENACTED WHERE WE SEE MEMBERS GET CANCER BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN CARCINOGENS OR SILICA OR AS BEST AS WERE ABLE TO ENACT REGULATIONS -- AFTER MANY DECADES OF WITNESS WORKERS SUFFERING ONLY TO SEE THEM REPEALED I DO TO INDUSTRY PRESSURE. THIS BILL WOULD SAY ONCE WE HAVE FINALLY WON AN ESTABLISHED THAT WORKERS NEED THOSE PROTECTIONS THEY SHOULD NOT BE REPEALED CALIFORNIA SHOULD HAVE THE ABILITY. TO RELY ON THOSE STANDARDS TO KEEP WORKERS SAFE THANK YOU THANK YOU. THANK YOU TWENTY TWO MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS JENNIFER APPEARING HERE TODAY AND SUPPORT -- ON BEHALF OF THE MOUNTAIN LION FOUNDATION AND ALSO DEFENDERS OF WILDLIFE THANK YOU THANK YOU. GOOD MORNING KATE LIKELY WELL WITH THE CALIFORNIA COAST KEEPER ALLIANCE AN ORGANIZATION THAT REPRESENTS WATER KEEPERS FROM THE OREGON BORDER DANCING DIEGO.

ALL RIGHT -- WILL NEXT HEAR FROM FOLKS WANT TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION. PLEASE APPROACH THE DíAS. GOOD MORNING SEVEN A MORNING CHAIR ALAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE HAD INCORRECTLY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WANT TO BEGIN BY STATING. WE DON'T THINK THIS SHOULD BE A PARTISAN ISSUE OUR BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA. SUPPORT SB ONES GOAL OF PROTECTING CALIFORNIA'S ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL AND LABOR LAWS AGAINST FEDERAL ROLL BACKS. WE HOWEVER DISAGREE WITH STRUCTURED -- SPECIFICALLY SB -- ONE ALTHOUGH HAS A NOBLE INTENT IT ROLLS BACK APA PROTECTIONS AS TO HOW STATE AGENCIES PROMULGATE RULE MAKING. IT CREATES AN AMBIGUOUS STANDARD UNDER A LESS STRINGENT -- UNDEFINED TERM WHICH WE THINK WILL INSTIGATE. LITIGATION AND REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY TO BE QUITE FRANK -- CALIFORNIA EMPLOYERS HAVE BEEN OPERATING UNDER THE CURRENT EXISTING LEGAL REGIME FOR DECADES AND WE CONTINUE TO EXPECT TO OPERATE UNDER THAT -- BUT CALIFORNIA AGENCIES ALREADY RETAIN EXISTING AUTHORITY TO DO EXACTLY WHAT SB ONE IS TRYING TO ACCOMPLISH. IT'S WHY CALIFORNIA CONSIDERS ITSELF -- ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER BECAUSE WE ALREADY HAVE ROBUST ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS THAT EXCEED FEDERAL STANDARDS IN ALMOST ALL CASES WHERE THERE IS AN INTERRELATIONSHIP OR A FABRIC WOVEN BETWEEN FEDERAL AND AND STATE LAW. WE THINK SB ONE COULD BE MUCH MORE NARROWLY TARGETED TO ACCOMPLISH -- THAT GAP BUT IN MOST CIRCUMSTANCES A ROLL BACK AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL WILL NOT IMPLICATE STATE. ENVIRONMENTAL OR LABOR LAWS AND WHERE IT DOES WE THINK IF YOU WANT TO BE MUCH MORE NARROWLY TAILORED TO ADDRESS THAT -- ALSO HIGHLY PRADA PROBLEMATIC UNDER SB ONE IS THE FACT THAT IT MANDATE STATE AGENCIES TO PROMULGATE RULEMAKING WITHOUT -- ALE REVIEW OR A PA PROTECTIONS INCLUDING A NOTICE AND PUBLIC COMMENT. THAT MEANS THE STATE AGENCIES WILL BE DOING EMERGENCY RULE MAKING WITH NO NOTICE TO ANY STAKEHOLDERS INCLUDING NGOS ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS AND BUSINESS COMMUNITY. AND THE ONLY REDRESS IF THE AGENCY AT A POORLY WRITTEN RULE IS THROUGH LITIGATION AND WE THINK THAT WILL CAUSE -- EXCESSIVE COSTS TO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA WITH VERY LITTLE ENVIRONMENTAL OR LABOR PROTECTIONS -- FOR ALL THESE REASONS AND WHAT MY COLLEAGUE WILL ADDRESS NEXT -- WE RESPECTFULLY OPPOSE SB ONE FOR THOSE REASONS THANKS. ARE YOU PROPOSING AMENDMENTS OR OR ITS AT A PERCENT UNLESS AMENDED OR WE'VE BEEN WORKING WITH -- THE AUTHORS OFFICE TO MORE NARROWLY CRAFT SB ONE IF THEY'RE OPEN TO THAT WE WOULD OPPOSE UNLESS AMENDED AT THIS TIME WE HAVE ELEVATED TO A JOB KILLER PRECISELY BECAUSE THE LACK OF DUE PROCESS AND OTHER AMBIGUITIES IN SB -- ONE FRANKLY WE DO NOT BELIEVE WILL ACTUALLY ACHIEVE THE GOAL OF THE THE STATED INTENT OF THE PROPONENTS THANKS. GOOD MORNING NO WELL KRAMER'S THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION. I JUST WANT TO START OUT BY SAYING THAT OUR MEMBERS APPRECIATE THE CLEAN AIR AND CLEAN WATER -- AND ABUNDANT WILDLIFE HABITAT THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA AND WE THINK THAT. MUCH OF THAT IS BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT OUR MEMBERS HAVE DONE IN THE SECTION NATURAL RESOURCES. THAT BEING SAID REASONABLE PEOPLE CAN CERTAINLY DISAGREE ABOUT THE BEST APPROACH TO PROVIDE THOSE PROTECTIONS AND WE THINK THAT SB ONE IS NOT. THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO ENSURE THAT CALIFORNIA MAINTAINED ITS LEADERSHIP ROLE IN PROTECTING ITS ENVIRONMENT. I WANT TO SPEAK MORE SPECIFICALLY ALL OF INSTANCES. I'M ON WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNED WITH REMOVING THE PUBLIC PROCESS -- FOR COMMENTING ON DEVELOPMENT OF REGULATIONS SO SB ONE PROPOSES THAT. THE AGENCIES WOULD REVIEW CHANGES AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL AND PER PROPOSE A LIST OF ACTIONS THAT THEY COULD TAKE TO MAKE SURE THAT WE'RE NOT BACKSLIDING. IT WOULD ALLOW THE PUBLIC TO COMMENT ON THAT LIST. BUT THEN WHEN THE AGENCY MOVES FORWARD AND ACTUALLY ADOPTS REGULATION THE PUBLIC IS NOT IS NO LONGER ALLOWED AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT. I'LL GIVE A VERY SPECIFIC EXAMPLE I'M AT THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD RIGHT NOW THEY ARE IN THE PROCESS OF ADOPTING REGULATIONS TO REQUIRE ADDITIONAL REPORTING FOR PERMITTED ENTITIES ON AND THE INITIAL PROPOSAL. FOR FOR BUTTE COUNTY. COUNTY HAS A PROBLEM APPROXIMATELY FIVE HUNDRED PERMITTED ENTITIES THEY ESTIMATED THAT TEN OF THOSE AND OF THOSE PERMITTED FACILITIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO THIS NEW REPORTING REQUIREMENTS. FARM BUREAU COMMENTED ON THAT -- THE AGENCY IS NOW IN THE PROCESS OF MAKING CHANGES TO THAT THE NEW PROPOSAL WOULD BRING IN APPROXIMATELY FOUR HUNDRED OF THE PERMITTED FACILITIES IN BUTTE COUNTY. SO UNDER SB ONE WE WOULD HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT JUST ON THE FACT THAT. THEY ARE CONSIDERING ADOPTING REGULATIONS TO REPORT WE WOULD NEVER HAVE AN OPPORTUNITY TO COMMENT ON THE SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND WHO IS SUBJECT TO THAT REPORTING. SO THAT'S A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN OF OURS -- ANOTHER PIECE IS I'M I KNOW THIS IS NOT OF THE COMMITTEE'S JURISDICTION BUT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT. QUESTIONS AS TO HOW OUR WATER SYSTEM COULD BE MANAGED UNDER SB. ONE I'M SB ONE PURPORTS TO GIVE ADDITIONAL AUTHORITY TO THE STATE TO CONTROL THE CENTRAL OPERATION OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY PROJECT. IT ALSO WOULD LIKELY THROW OUT THIS -- RECENTLY NEGOTIATED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS AND MAKE IT A CHALLENGE TO ADOPT AND REVISE. UPDATED BIOLOGICAL OPINIONS THERE'S A BIOLOGICAL OPINION TO OPERATE THAT I'M. CENTER VALLEY PROJECT IN THE DELTA THAT IS RECENTLY BEING REVISED. SB ONE WOULD PREVENT THOSE REVISIONS FROM. AND SO THE CONCERN IS CALIFORNIA WILL BE PROHIBITED FROM KIND OF FOLLOWING SCIENCE AS WE LEARN MORE ABOUT HOW TO IMPROVE OUR MANAGEMENT WE WILL BE LOCKED IN. THE PAST ACTIONS EVEN IF THEY'RE DECADES OLD WE WON'T BE ALLOWED TO MAKE CHANGES FOR RISK OF LITIGATION BECAUSE SOME FOLKS MIGHT. VIEW THOSE CHANGES AS BACKSLIDING. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND OTHERS -- FARM BUREAU AS OPPOSED TO SB ONE THANK YOU. THANK YOU OF FOLKS WANT. TO VOICE THEIR OPPOSITION. DENNIS. DENNIS ALL THE ONLY BE OUT THE CALIFORNIA GRAIN FEED ASSOCIATE CALIFORNIA'S SEEING SEVERAL OTHER AGRICULTURAL ORGANIZATIONS. WE AFFILIATE OUR COMMENTS WITH WITH THE FOLKS WHO BELIEVE THAT THIS IS FAR TOO BROAD OF A OF A THINGS TO ME TO BE MORE NARROWLY TAILORED THANK YOU THANK YOU. JOHN JACOB ON BEHALF OF THE CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA JUST. CONCERNED THAT THE WEAKENING OUR ADMINISTRATIVE PROTOCOLS IS -- EXCESSIVE RESPONSE TO WHAT WE RECOGNIZE IS -- AN UNFORTUNATE AND REGRETTABLE -- DIRECTION AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL. MR KERRY MEMBERS BEST A LOSS ON BEHALF OF THE AGRICULTURAL ENERGY CONSUMERS ASSOCIATION I MEAN REGRETFUL OPPOSITION IN CONCUR WITH THE CHAMBER AND THE FARM BUREAU THANK YOU. YOUR SINGLE PICKY WITH CALIFORNIA FORESTRY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL WE HAVE PARTICULAR CONCERNS WITH THE C. SO PROVISIONS IN IT WOULD BE HELPFUL FOR THESE FOR OUR ORGANIZATION. TO HAVE A LIST OF THOSE FEDERAL ACTIONS -- WITH REGARDS TO SEE SAID TO SEE WHAT THOSE CHANGES FOR THOSE PARTICULAR CHANGES ARE AND GIVE. OKAY THANK YOU I'VE BEEN TO THE MAT THE ITEM IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE LET'S GO -- TO CENTER WILL COST. THANK YOU AUTHORS CAN WE GO TO PAGE TWO IF I'M READING THE BILL RIGHT AND WE'VE GOT THE PROVISIONS OF THE WHOLE THERE ARE GONNA BE OPERATIVE UNTIL JANUARY TWENTIETH TO TWENTY TWENTY SIX AND THEN. ON JANUARY FIRST OF THE POINT TWENTY FIVE IN JANUARY FIRST OF TWENTY TWENTY SIX FIGURE TO BE REPEALED -- THEN IF WE COULD SO THAT'S THAT'S FOOD THE WHOLE BILL IS ONLY GOING TO BE FOR SIX YEARS ALL RIGHT. THEN I'M LOOKING AT THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS THIS IS CHAPTER TWO PAGE FOR STARTING AT LINE. TWENTY FIVE YES SIR FROM THE CHAMBER -- I'D AND OTHER FARM BUREAU AND OTHER GROUPS ABOUT ABOUT -- THE PUBLIC INPUT REGULATIONS RIGHT AND I'M WONDERING. WHY WE NEED A FOR VISION TO IN GENERAL RIGHT BECAUSE WE HVE THE STATUS QUO THERE HAVE BEEN REGULATIONS ISSUE THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THERE BEEN PUBLIC HEARINGS WE'RE NOT CHANGING ANYTHING WE JUST HAVE IT SO THIS SEEMS LIKE TWO BITES AT THE APPLE IF YOU WILL? FROM MY PERSPECTIVE BECAUSE BECAUSE WE'RE GONNA HAVE. I DON'T KNOW I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS ARE NECESSARY BECAUSE THEY THERE ARE REGULATIONS RIGHT NOW AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL SO COULD YOU COMMENT ON THAT. TO A START YEAH. LET ME JUMP ON THAT BECAUSE I YOU TOOK THE KEY YOU KNOWLEDGE AS BETTER THAN I COULD HAVE TO BUY TO THE SAME APPLE -- I'M HUNGRY. YES I SHOULD NOT ADDRESS -- YEAH I I THINK THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE ADMINISTRATIVE PROCESS IN THIS SORT OF FEAR OF LITIGATION IS MISS FOUNDED AT THIS POINT BECAUSE THE THE INTENT HERE IS JUST. IS PRESERVATION RIGHT SO IT'S NOT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT ADDING ADDITIONAL REGULATORY BURDENS ON TO INDUSTRY OR ANYTHING IN ADDITION ANY KIND OF NEW ADDITION OF AUTHORITY THAT WOULD REQUIRE. ANY NOTICE AND COMMENT -- I MEAN SO -- POINT IS RIGHT THAT IN SOME WAYS AS I SAID EARLIER THIS BILL IS MORE ABOUT AN ORGANIZING PRINCIPLE. FOR THE ADMINISTRATION TO A THIRD TO OPERATE UNDER FOR THE NEXT -- YOU KNOW SEVERAL YEARS HOPEFULLY NOT NOT AS MANY ME HOPEFULLY WON'T NEED THIS INSURANCE POLICY THAT MUCH LONGER AND EVEN FOLKS AND YOU KNOW CONGRESS COULD STEP UP AND PUSHED BACK AND CHANGE THEIR MIND BUT I THINK. YOU'RE RIGHT IN THAT THIS IS MERELY A PRESERVATION OF THE STATUS QUO -- AND THAT'S THE END. BUT I WOULD ADD A YOU KNOW WE'VE WE'VE WORKED ON THIS LEGISLATION BEFORE THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME YOU'VE SEEN THIS. ARE WE HAVE BROUGHT IT BACK BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE IT IS NECESSARY WE HAVE BEEN WILLING TO WORK WITH -- IN THE PAST YEAR ARE THE ADMINISTRATION AND THAT WAS ONE OF THE ISSUES THAT WAS BROUGHT UP WE CERTAINLY DON'T WANT TO HAVE ARE PUT INTO PLACE LESS OF OF RULES AND THEN HAVE THINGS CHANGE AT THE FEDERAL LEVEL THAT COULD CAUSE US HARM. BUT AT THE SAME TIME I THINK WILL NOT BE IN WILL ABLE TO WEIGH IN. OUT WHEN DEPARTMENTS MAKE -- REGULATORY GUIDELINES DECISIONS RULES WE CAN ADDRESS THAT MOVING FORWARD THOSE WERE CONCERNS BROUGHT UP BEFORE -- AND I'M MORE THAN WILLING I THINK WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS THIS IS THE FIRST OF FOUR HEARINGS -- TO OTHER HEARINGS AND THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE. IF THOSE WHO ARE IN OPPOSITION WHO ARE WHO HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THIS WANT TO WORK ON THAT VERY ISSUE WE ARE MORE THAN WILLING TO IF WE ARE WORKING IN GOOD FAITH TO WORK SOMETHING THAT THAT -- CODIFIES AND PROTECTS OUR EXISTING PROTECTIONS ON WORKERS CLEAN AIR CLEAN WATER I ENDANGERED SPECIES SO THAT WE WOULD HAVE THOSE CONCERNS AS A LEGISLATIVE BODY. OUT WHEN YOU LOOK AT ADMINISTRATIVE -- AGENCIES THAT CAN DO THAT WITHOUT OUR INPUT SO IF YOU WANT TO HAVE A SERIOUS DISCUSSION ABOUT THAT WE HAVE TIME TO WORK ON THAT. I AND WE WOULD HAVE SIMILAR CONCERNS BUT I I THINK I SOME OF THE COMMENTS ON THAT. I HAVE BEEN USED AS A SHIELD NOT TO REALLY WORK WITH US -- TO TO ACTUALLY GET FURTHER AND MAKE A SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA CAN AFFECTIVELY USE AND AT THE SAME TIME CONTINUE TO MOVE FORWARD. ON REGULAR REGULATORY ISSUES SCHEMES AND I HEARINGS THAT FURTHER GOALS VALUES IN CALIFORNIA THIS PARAGRAPH -- ONE SAYS THE AGENCY MAY. ADOPT STANDARDS SO THEY DON'T HAVE TO TELL STANDS TO MEAN I'M SITTING HERE AND SAYING. THE THE SECRETARY OF THE EPA IS THE SAME SECRETARY THAT WAS REGION NINE TODAY AND THEY PROMULGATED RULES AND REGION NINE AND NATIONALLY ON THE EPA. THEY DON'T HAVE TO DO THAT DANCE AGAIN BUT THEN IT SAYS IN PARAGRAPH TWO IF YOU DECIDE TO ADOPT STANDARDS THEN YOU SHALL THEY SHALL BE DEEMED TO BE EMERGENCY AND I THINK. THAT'S WHAT CLICK SEND AT THE SECOND LEVEL THIS IDEA WHAT YOU HAVE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS. OBVIOUSLY THERE BRIDGES REGULATIONS AND THEY SHOULD HAPPEN RIGHT NOW RIGHT THAT'S WHY YOU WOULD DO THAT BUT THEN IT GETS INTO THE THE THE PHOTO DUE PROCESS ARGUMENT THAT'S BEING -- BUT IT YEAH I OBJECT I AGREE AND AND I THINK YOU HEAR WILLINGNESS FROM THE PRO TEM TO TO WORK THIS THROUGH AND AND AND MAKE IT FUNCTIONAL. BUT IT'S A COPY AND PASTE JOB IS CURRENTLY WHAT THE BILLS ALL IT ST RIGHT YOU'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT AN ENTIRELY NEW REGULATORY FRAMEWORK THAT'S EMERGING OUT OF NO WHERE. THE MILITARY JUST PUTTING THE SAME THING THAT'S ALREADY IN THE C. C. R. -- IN YOU KNOW. THAT'S IN THE FEDERAL CODE REGULATIONS INTO THE CALIFORNIA CODE OF REGULATIONS LITERALLY COPY PASTE THAT'S THAT'S WHY A WORD WE DON'T HAVE THE SAME PROCEDURAL CONCERNS BUT IF THE MECHANICS. ARE THE ISSUE YEAH I THINK THERE'S THERE'S OPENNESS SO THUNDERSTONE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN -- IT ADAM FROM THE CHAMBER IF I COULD ASK YOU A QUESTION SIR -- BASED ON YOUR INTERPRETATION OF THE BILL OF THE STATE AGENCIES HAVE TO CONDUCT AN ECONOMIC ANALYSIS OF THE EMERGENCY REGULATIONS UNDER THIS BILL. WELL CERTAINLY POSSIBLE THAT IT COULD BE CONSIDERED MAJOR ROLE MAKING IF IT TRIGGERS A FIFTY MILLION DOLLAR OR MORE -- REGULATORY IMPACT ON THE RATE A COMMUNITY -- WE HAVEN'T DONE THAT ANALYSIS BUT UNDER SB -- FORTY NINE WHICH IS BASICALLY THE SAME BILL SB ONE IS -- THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE THIS WOULD IMPACT AGENCIES AT A LEVEL OF TEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY WHEN AGENCY I THINK IT WAS CAR WOULD BE ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS ANNUALLY TO DO THIS. POLITICIAN OF LIST AND PROBABLY GET -- RULE MAKING -- SO. IT'S POSSIBLE WE HAVE AN ACCIDENT THE CALCULATIONS BUT AT ELEVEN MILLION DOLLARS PER AGENCY IT'S SIGNIFICANT COST. OKAY. MAYBE THAT PRETEND YOU MIGHT ADDRESS AS WELL SENATOR THANK YOU I IN IN LOOKING AT THE FEDERAL RIGS THE ANALYSIS IS ALREADY BEING CONDUCTED BY THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT. I WHICH IS WHY THE BASELINE IS SET SO THAT ANALYSIS IS ALREADY BEEN CONDUCTED [inaudible] CAN YOU. THANK YOU I'M. FOLLOWING UP ON MY COLLEAGUES COMMENTS -- I THINK THIS WOULD BE YOUR ATTENTION I WOULD HOPE THAT IN -- STAKEHOLDER MEETINGS TO ADDRESS THE ISSUES HE RAISED ABOUT THE WHAT MIGHT BE CONSIDERED EMERGENCY BRAKES THAT WE DON'T BE IN A SITUATION WHERE WE ARE. EITHER WEAKENING THAT FOR CAUSING IT -- TO DELAYING SINCE AS SENATOR STERN POINTED OUT IN MOST CASES. THIS IS GONNA BE A AT A ADOPTION OF RAKES THAT WERE ALREADY VETTED DOT ECONOMIC ANALYSIS DONE -- STAKEHOLDER PROCESS ENGAGED IN BECAUSE THEY WERE ADOPTED BY THE FEDS AND WE'RE JUST TRYING TO REPLACE. THOSE THAT -- HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED DUE TO THIS CURRENT ADMINISTRATION SECTION. NOW THAT SAID. TO ME THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BILL IS MORE THAN JUST THE FACT THAT THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION HAS. BACK PEDALED ON THESE VERY IMPORTANT RAKES. AS MUCH AS CALIFORNIA PRIDES ITSELF AS AN ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER. WE HAVE TO DIRTY STEER IN THE NATION. WE HAVE A LARGE NUMBER OF COMMUNITIES THAT ARE NON ATTAINMENT EVEN THOUGH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO GO FURTHER THAN THE NATIONAL CLEAN AIR ACT. WE HAVE PEOPLE EVERY DAY WHOSE HEALTH IS IMPACTED AND ARE SUFFERING DUE TO OUR THIRTY ADDITIONALLY. I THINK SOME OF US WELL SOME OF US KNEW THAT WE HAD CALIFORNIA RESIDENTS WHO DID NOT HAVE CLEAN -- HEALTHY DRINKING WATER I THINK NONE OF US ADDITION SAY. NINE MANY OF YOU MAY BUT I THINK THAT FOR MANY OF US. THE UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAD A MILLION CALIFORNIANS WHO LITERALLY CANNOT DRINK THE WATER OUT OF THEIR CAP. WHEN WE PRIDE OURSELVES ON BEING THE ENVIRONMENTAL LEADER? THAT I WAS VERY PROUD THAT OUR NEW GOVERNOR HAS. DECIDED TO REALLY TAKE THAT ON BECAUSE THOSE THAT'S JUST A BASIC HUMAN RIGHT. HAVING CLEAN ACCESS TO CLEAN WATER AND NOT HAVING TO GO BUY IT I MEAN CERTAINLY WE PAY OUR WATER BILL BUT I MEAN NOT HAVING TO GO. AND GET IT IN A SEPARATE CONTAINER. SO MY POINT IS THAT I WOULD HOPE AND I THINK THE WAY THE BILL IS WRITTEN. IT ALLOWS AN AGENCY TO GO FOR IT MAY NOT ALLOW THE AGENCY TO GO FURTHER WITHOUT. SOME LEVEL OF PROCESS BUT CERTAINLY IT IS ENCOURAGING OR AGENCIES. TO MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE THE STRONGEST POSSIBLE RAKES TO CLEAN OUR AIR AND CLEAN OUR WATER IN THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTIONS THAT. YOU THAT ARTICULATED IN THE BILL AS WELL AS MAKE SURE THAT OUR WORKERS ARE PROTECTED. SO WITH THAT UNDERSTANDING I COMPLETELY SUPPORT THE BILL MINISTER. THANK YOU -- THANK YOU GUYS BY I THINK CONCEPTUALLY -- NOT SOMETHING THAT I HAVE A REAL HEART BURN ABOUT I GUESS MY HEART BURNS OUT WHY DO WE NEED. ARE HAVING SERVED AT LOCAL GOVERNMENT FOR MANY YEARS WE OFTEN A DOCTOR DOWN REGULATIONS OR ORDINANCES THAT WE EXCEEDED THE FATE STANDARD. AND THAT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT WE HAVE THAT. OPPORTUNITY HERE. THE AUTHORITY HERE TO ADOPT A AND CODIFY WHAT WE CURRENTLY HAVE. THAT MIGHT BE MORE THAN A NEW FEDERAL STANDARD THAT COULD BE -- MINIMIZE DIMINISHED SO WHEN I READ IT I THOUGHT WHY ARE WE DOING THIS AND I THINK THAT'S ONE OF THE CONCERNS. ARE YEAH IN AS FAR REACHING IMPLICATIONS REGARDING THE PUBLIC PROCESS. HE ADDED TO ALWAYS TROUBLES ME WHEN WE TAKE POWER FROM THE PEOPLE AND GIVE IT TO BUREAUCRACIES THAT ARE LEFT IN WHICH IS. YOU KNOW KIND OF STATED IN HERE IF NOT DIRECTLY THAT'S THE IMPLICATION. SO I'D LIKE TO HEAR AND I'M ENCOURAGED TO HEAR THAT YOU ARE OPEN TO MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS WHEN I HEARD. THAT YOU DO NOT BELIEVE THERE MIGHT BE EARLY ATTEMPTS ISSUE WERE FORMULATING THE BILL SO. PLEASE COMMENT ON THAT AND PLEASE COMMENT ON WHEN AND WHERE BEFORE IT HITS THE NEXT COMMITTEE OR AT LEAST GET TO APPROPRIATIONS. THAT YOU HAVE REALLY DONE -- REAL. GOOD FAITH EFFORT TO INCLUDE THOSE SO WE ADDRESS THE ISSUES THAT ARE I THINK ARE VERY CONCERNING TO THE PUBLIC. OUR WHETHER THAT BE THE ENVIRONMENTAL COMMUNITY OR THE BUSINESS COMMUNITY ALL OF US. IN THAT WAY WERE PARTNERS THAT WE SHOULD HAVE A STAND BEFORE BUREAUCRACIES WHEN THESE THINGS IMPACT US WHETHER THAT BE TO OUR NATURAL. RESOURCES OUR ENVIRONMENT OR TO THE SURVIVAL OF OUR BUSINESS -- AND ECONOMIC -- STABILITY IN OUR STATE AND THESE ARE THINGS THAT ARE VERY TROUBLING. I TO ME JUST IN GENERAL AND TAKING OFF A PARTISAN HAT. TO ME THAT SOMETHING THAT WE SHOULD STAND FIRST AND FOREMOST AS REPRESENTATIVES OF THE PEOPLE HERE. AND THE FART STEW A QUESTION -- THAT TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY AND DOES START TO SMELL TO PARTISAN FOR ME. SO PLEASE ANSWER THOSE QUESTIONS IN BUT NOT TODAY. I APPRECIATE THAT -- ADVICE HERE I'M A COUPLE THOUGHTS -- ONE TO THE PERSON FROM THE FARM BUREAU THAT SPOKE-- YEAH I WANT TO SAY IT THERE IS THE PROBLEM IS THAT IN SOME CASES WE NEED TO CHANGE WE NEED WE DO NEED A CHANGE IN STATE LAW. TO SET THE BASELINE AND WITHOUT THAT THERE'S NO MECHANISM TO ENSURE THOSE FEDERAL BASELINE STAY IN PLACE. AND THEN EXAMPLE THAT I WAS PROVIDED I FEDERAL FISH AND WILDLIFE SERVICE'S PROPOSE ROLLING BACK ENDANGERED SPECIES THAT PROTECTIONS AND THOSE PROTECTIONS GO AWAY. IF THEY DO STATE WOULD HAVE TO GO TO FEDERAL COURT IN ORDER -- TO PROTECT THAT'S ONE EXAMPLE SO WHILE THERE EIGHT ARE EXAMPLES ON BOTH SIDES. WHAT I WOULDSAY IS THIS -- WE ARE WHERE WE ARE. IN THE FEDERAL PROTECTIONS AND THE STATE PROTECTIONS. AFTER DECADES AND DECADES OF THIS PROCESS IS VERY PROCESS BEFORE US. TO SET THOSE GOALS AND THOSE GUIDELINES IN THOSE REGULATIONS IN SOME FORM OF STATUTE OR REGULATIONS. TO MEET THOSE VALUES IN THOSE GOALS. AND REGARDLESS OF PARTISAN DIFFERENCES OF OPINION AS TO WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IN EACH OF THOSE AREAS THESE FIGHTS HAVE BEEN DONE -- BUT THERE ARE FOLKS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SEE ROLL BACKS. AND I IN THIS VERY STATE WE'VE HAD THESE DISCUSSIONS -- SO FOR THAT REASON I THAT IS BASICALLY THE ULTIMATE GOAL OF THIS LEGISLATION WHILE IT MAY SEEM UNNECESSARY. IN SOME CASES IT ISN'T AN ARE IN TERMS OF YOUR COMMENT ABOUT -- YOU KNOW I WANT T LOSE OUR AUTHORITY AS THE LEGISLATURE BECAUSE IDON'T ALWAYS AGREE WITH -- DECISIONS MADE WITHIN -- A DEPARTMENT OR AN AGENCY WILL SAY BUREAUCRACY IF YOU WILL BUT THE NATURE OF BUREAUCRACIES IT IS REMOVED FROM THE PEOPLE WE ARE NOT REMOVED FROM THE PEOPLE. THEY HAVE HEARINGS IN WHICH THEY CAN HEAR THE PEOPLE BUT WE ARE THE CHECK AND BALANCE ON THAT AND WE HAVE. TO CONSTANTLY WORK IF YOU WILL -- TO ENSURE THAT THAT ACCESS IS THERE WHEN I SAY GOOD FAITH EFFORT I MEAN IT -- I AM QUITE AWARE OF UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THE GOOD THINGS THAT WE TRY TO DO. THAT THE THE FOLKS THAT WERE HERE TO SPEAK IN OPPOSITION TODAY. I HAVE ARE WORKED WITH THE WHOLE TIME I'VE BEEN IN THE LEGISLATURE I LISTEN I HEAR AND I ACTUALLY INCORPORATE A LOT OF WHAT THEY SAY INTO. A GOING FORWARD. I KNOW THAT THERE ARE ALWAYS BI PARTISAN ISSUES WITHIN THE POLITICS AND IN THE POLICIES THAT WE TAKE FORWARD. MY MY REASON FOR BEING HERE IS NOT. ART RELATED TO THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION I YOU YOU DO NOT HEAR ME MENTIONING A NAME. THAT IS NOT MY GOAL MY GOAL IS TO MAKE SURE THAT THESE PROTECTIONS AND THESE GOALS THAT WE HAVE PUT INTO PLACE WHICH IS WHY I SIGNED ON TO THIS PIECE OF LEGISLATION. AND WANTED TO TAKE IT FORWARD. HOT ALTHOUGH IT YOU KNOW IT DIDN'T MOVE FORWARD LAST YEAR FOR VARIOUS REASONS INCLUDED SOME OF THE COMMENTS MADE BY SOME OF THE FOLKS WHO ARE CONCERNED -- YOU HAVE MY GOOD FAITH EFFORT I WANT THAT GOOD FAITH EFFORT THAT IF WE STRIVE TO MEET. THOSE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE A CHANCE TO GET ACTUAL SUPPORT. OUR NEUTRALITY I AS WE TRIED TO ESTABLISH AND SUPPORT THAT BASELINE SO -- MATTER BY SURE YOU HAVE MY WORD ON A AND I KNOW THAT -- THIS IS A SERIOUS INTENT NOT JUST A A SHOW -- AND IN MY CLOTHES ARE I WILL PROBABLY MAKE A PERSONAL COMMENT AS TO WHY I'M DOING THIS BILL. THANK YOU APPRECIATE THAT THANK YOU [inaudible] I'M. I THINK THERE'S A COUPLE POINTS THAT WE WE SHOULD REMIND OURSELVES ONE IS. THAT WE IS THE LEGISLATURE DO YOU HAVE THE POWER TO OVERTURN AGENCIES RAKES. NOW WE HAVE TO DO IT THROUGH INTRODUCING A BILL INTO STATUTE BUT WE HAVE AS EVERYONE KNOWS WE'VE ADJUSTED [inaudible] VARIOUS -- RAKES OF AGENCIES OVER TOWN TIME. I THINK WE OBVIOUSLY. IN TRIED TO DO THAT. PRETTY JUDICIOUSLY BECAUSE WE WANT TO RESPECT MANY OF OUR STATUTES. BASICALLY GIVE GOALS TO AGENCIES AND ASKING THEM TO DO THAT VERY THOROUGH STAKEHOLDER AND PUBLIC VETTING PROCESS. TO DEVELOP THE BEST ONES POSSIBLE AND THE OTHER BENEFIT OF COURSE TO AGENCY RAKES VERSUS OUR STATUTES IS. AS MUCH AS I MEAN EITHER EITHER PROCESS WHETHER IT'S AN AGENCY RAKE OR STATUTE THEY CAN BE CUMBERSOME. BUT THE AGENCIES CAN SOMETIMES OPERATE FASTER THAN WE CAN BECAUSE WE ARE UNLESS OUR BILLS ARE URGENT. ARE -- PROCESS TAKES A FULL YEAR AND THEN IT'S ANOTHER NUMBER OF MONTHS BEFORE. OUR STATUTES EVEN GO IN EFFECT AND THEN IF WE LONG IT TAKES US TO HAVE TO COME BACK SO I THINK THERE'S AS MUCH AS WE CAN BE LEGITIMATELY AT TIMES CRITICAL. OF AGENCY RAKES OUR PROCESS HAS ITS PROS AND CONS BUT THE LAST POINT I WANT TO MAKE IT IS. WHEN WE REFER? TO WARNING TO RESPECT THE PUBLIC. I IN FOLLOWING THE THERE WERE THE UNDOING. OF THE ENVIRONMENTAL RAKES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDONE IN THE LAST YEAR TO YEAR AND A HALF. I WAS UNABLE TO FIND ANY CITATION OF ANY PUBLIC PROCESS. THAT WAS INVOLVED IN THE UNDOING OF THOSE. WHEREAS. THERE WAS. EIGHT EIGHT VERY EXTENSIVE STAKEHOLDER AND PUBLIC PROCESS IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND FOR SOME OF US. IT FELT LIKE A RIDICULOUSLY LONG FOR MANY OF THESE RAKES THAT WERE QUICKLY THEN ON DONE. THE PROMULGATION OF THEM THEY'VE THE DEVELOPMENT OF TOOK. MINIMUM FOR UP TO EIGHT YEARS MANY OF THEM SO I I THINK IT'S VERY IMPORTANT TO PUTTHAT INTO CONTEXT WHEN WE TALK ABOUT WHETHER WE'RE RESPECTING THE PUBLIC OR NOT. DOES A GOOD JOB OF SIMILAR TO MY FEELINGS ON THIS BILL SO AND WITH THAT I'D LOVE. TO US AND I WILL. OKAY THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR -- ARE THERE OTHER QUESTIONS OR CONCERNS FROM THE COMMITTEE. I WITH THAT THE OFFICE MAY CLOSE. I'LL BE BRIEF AND DEFERRED. TO THE ARE WILL ARTICULATE ARGUMENTS FROM OUR LEADER -- WHEN THEY ARE JUST SAY IS? THE GOAL HERE I THINK THAT IN FOR PARTNERS IN -- THE FARM BUREAU IN AGRICULTURE IN THE BUSINESS SECTOR WHO WANT TO GET TO A PLACE OF SOME PREDICTABILITY. AND SOME CERTAINTY I THINK THAT'S IT THAT'S A GOOD THAT'S A GOOD COMMON GOAL TO TRY TO LAND AT BECAUSE WE DON'T LIKE IS A RADIC. REGULATION WE DON'T LIKE THINGS% COMING OUT US OUT OF NO WHERE. I THINK THAT PROCESS THAT. YOU LAID OUT AT A TIME AND NOTICE AND ALL THOSE THINGS THAT SORT OF KERR A REALLY IMPORTANT AS SORT OF BUILDING AND CODIFY SOMEHOW TO TO WHETHER WHATEVER STORMS WE FACE SO I I I I I THINK THERE'S THERE'S ROOM THERE AND I THINK -- IT'S YEAH THERE THERE'S A WAY TO MOVE THIS FORWARD -- AS CALIFORNIANS AND AND TRULY BE CALIFORNIA BETTER LAW. THANK YOU. VERY QUICKLY I WOULD JUST TO ADD BECAUSE I THINK YOU'VE GIVEN US QUITE ENOUGH TIME. I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS THE QUESTIONS I DO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH EVERYONE AS PART OF THIS PROCESS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD AGAIN. IT'S GOING THROUGH QUITE A NUMBER OF COMMITTEES FOR THAT VERY REASON -- YOU KNOW THIS IS VERY PERSONAL TO ME. I GREW UP IN APPALACHIA MY DAD WAS A COAL MINER A LEAD MINER WE WATCHED AS OUR WATER WAS DEGRADED WE WATCHED AS THE MOUNTAINS WERE CHOPPED OFF WITHOUT. ANY KIND OF REHABILITATION RESTORATION -- I'M PRETTY SURE I BECAME AN ENVIRONMENTALIST ALTHOUGH NOT BY DEFINITION OF SOME THAT MIGHT -- V. HERE TODAY BASED VERY MUCH ON MY LIFE. MY DAD WORKED WENT INTO THE MINDS HE WAS A CONSTRUCTION WORKER WITHOUT THE YOU KNOW THE PROTECTIONS HE DID NOT HAVE AS A WORKER -- AS I WAS GROWING UP I SAW AS HIS BODY AGE. OUR RIGHT BEFORE ME -- SO WHEN I MOVED TO CALIFORNIA I HAVE TO SAY I WAS I WAS THRILLED TO SEE THE KINDS OF THINGS THAT ARE WORKED ON HERE -- AND THAT REALLY WOULD HAVE CHANGED HIS IT CHANGED MY LIFE THE COMMUNITIES THAT I LIVED IN WHERE THE WATER WAS BAD IN A BEAUTIFUL SETTING. AND YOU HAD NO IDEA THAT THE WATER WAS NOT DRINKABLE ON THOSE THINGS ARE VERY PERSONAL TO ME AND I THINK THAT DECADES OF PEOPLE REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS HAVE FOUGHT HARD -- WHEN THEY'VE SEEN THAT IN THEIR OWN LIVES TO RECTIFY I DON'T WANNA LOSE ONE SINGLE BIT OF GROUND THAT WE HAVE GAINED AND FOR ALL THAT WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO DO IN CALIFORNIA WE STILL HAVE THE WORST AIR QUALITY? OF ANY PLACE IN THIS COUNTRY AND SO WE HAVE WORK TO DO AND SOME OF THE REGULATIONS AND EXECUTIVE ORDERS HAVE SUGHT TO RESEND THE VERY GOALS AND THINGS THAT WERE DOING TO TRY TO REDUCE THAT POLLUTION. SO YES I'M WILLING TO WORK WITH ANYBODY THAT HAS A SERIOUS INTENT. I TO TO DO THIS IN THE RIGHT WAY SO I LOOK FORWARD TO THAT OPPORTUNITY I THANK YOU FOR YOUR TIME YOUR CONSIDERATION INTO MY COLLEAGUE -- FOR BEING WITH ME TODAY I ASK YOU FOR YOUR FOR YOUR SUPPORT TODAY.

THAN WHAT CASKEY. OKAY MEMBERS THIS IS A AS THE-MEMBERS OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE LEAVE THE DAIS THIS IS THE ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY COMMITTEE THIS IS ITEM NUMBER. THREE SB -- FIFTY FOUR BY CHEER ALLEN. AS WELL AS SAY SOON SURE -- STERN IS GOING TO STAY HERE. HILLMAN WHEN YOU ARE ASSEMBLED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR FEEL FREE TO AGAIN. SINCE. OUR CIVIC SO MUCH MISTER TERRY MEMBERS AND I WANT TO THANK MY MADE JOINT AUTHORS ON THIS -- MEASURES CENTER SKINNER CENTER STERN I CENTER WIENER. AND OUR OUR FRIENDS ON THE ASSEMBLY SY THE JOINT AUTHORS OVER THERE THERE'S A COMPANION BILL ON THE ASSEMBLY SIDE -- AUTHORED BY SOME MEMBER GONZALEZ WE HAVE A GREAT TEAM OF ON THAT SIDE AS WELL SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO ADDRESS SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT WE'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT TODAY -- BY REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF WASTED BURDENS TAXPAYERS IN OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS PLAGUE HUMAN HEALTH AND POLLUTE OUR NATURAL ENVIRONMENT BY DECREASING. SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS SOLD IN CALIFORNIA IT ENSURING THE REMAINING ITEMS ARE EFFECTIVELY COMPOSTED AND RECYCLING TRULY COMPOST AND RECYCLE SPEAKING TO THE ISSUE THAT WE HEARD. EARLIER. I IN CALIFORNIA THE SAD TRUTH IS THATLESS THAN 15% OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC IS ECYCLED. WITH THE COSTA RECYCLING EXCEEDING THE SCRAP VALUE OF THE PLASTIC MATERIAL. SO THAT'S CAUSING A PROBLEM IN THE RECYCLE MARKET THAT WE'VE DISCUSSED AS WELL. UNLIKE NATURAL MATERIALS THAT DECOMPOSE NEARLY EVERY PIECE OF PLASTIC EVER PRODUCED STILL EXISTS IN OUR LANDFILLS OR IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND IT'S NOT GOING TO GO AWAY -- AS THESE ITEMS RAGMENT INTO SMALLER PARTICLES KNOWN AS MICHAEL PLASTICS THEY CONCENTRATE TOXIC CHEMICALS AND CONTAMINATE OUR FOOD AND DRINKING WATER SOURCES AND THEN THESE TOXINS ENDS UP. INVOLVED WATER AND TABLE SALT AND FISHING AGRICULTURAL SOILS. AND THERE'S NO QUESTION THAT THERE HAVE BEEN TOXINS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLASTIC THAT DO END UP BEING LINKED TO CANCER AND BIRTH DEFECTS IMPAIRED IMMUNITY ENDOCRINE DISRUPTION. OTHER SERIOUS HEALTH PROBLEMS AND THE COST IS BEING BURNT BORN RIGHT NOW JUST ON LITTER CLEAN UP ALONE BY OUR TAXPAYERS TALK% PEOPLE TALK ABOUT AND HOW DO WE MAKE THIS. A COST EFFECTIVE THE FACT THE MATTER IS THAT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TAXPAYERS ARE STILL SPENDING FOUR HUNDRED TWENTY MILLION DOLLARS EVERY SINGLE YEAR OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS RIGHT HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. I IN ANNUAL ONGOING EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP AND PREVENT LITTER IN OUR STREETS AND OUR STORM DRAINS. IN OUR PARKS IN OUR WATERWAYS SO CLEAN UP A LOT OF MONEY RIGT NOW. AND UNFORTUNATELY IS AS WE HEARD NOT ONLY IS THE CLEAN EXPENSIVE BUT SIMPLY CAN'T KEEP PACE WITH THE PRODUCTION. OF SINGLE USE DISPOSABLE ITEMS. OR THE FACT THAT THE WAS ITEMS ARE BREAKING DOWN INTO -- MICRO PLASTICS WHICH SIMPLY CANNOT BE CLEANED UP BECAUSE THERE TOO TWO SMALL. LIST PRICE IS ONLY GETTING WORSE WE'VE HEARD ABOUT HOW CHINA INDIA AND ALL SORTS OF OTHER COUNTRIES ARE NOW NO LONGER TAKING OUR TRASH -- THERE NOW -- THAT'S NOW GETTING INCINERATED OFTENTIMES IN SOUTHEAST ASIA AND AND ENVIRONMENTALLY DEPLORABLE CONDITIONS -- OR OR JUST NOT LANDFILL THERE BUT JUST TOSSED OUT -- INTO THEIR ENVIRONMENT THAT END UP IN THE OCEAN. AND IMPACTING AYE ANIMALS SUCH AS THE WELLS THAT WE SAW ON THE ON THE SLIDE EARLIER TODAY SO THIS BILL SEEKS TO CREATE A COMPREHENSIVE FRAMEWORK TO ADDRESS THE POLLUTION AND WASTE CROSSETT CRISIS. ARE HANDING OVER TO CAL RECYCLE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO EVER SOURCE REDUCE AND AND ENSURE THAT WE ARE RECYCLING AT LEAST. 75% OF SINGLE USER. PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS BY TWENTY THIRTY PLAN IT OUTLINES HOW CALLOUS LOCAL ACHIEVE THOSE GOALS IT -- WES ARE OUR ACCOUNT CYCLE TO ADOPT REGULATIONS TO DETERMINE CREDIT CRITERIA FOR RECYCLABILITY AND COMPOSED ABILITY TO ADDRESS. THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED EARLIER IN THE HEARING IN THIS IS BASED ON THE SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FORTY THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE COMPROMISE THAT SEVERAL OF YOU ARE INVOLVED WITH. AND IT ALSO CALLS ON PLASTIC MANUFACTURES TO DEMONSTRATE A TWENTY TWO AND THEN A 40% RATE BY TWENTY TWENTY SIX TO ADDRESS. THE THE MARKET ASSOCIATED WITH -- WITH RECYCLING AND SO -- THESE ARE THE WE THINK THAT THIS IS A A COMPREHENSIVE APPROACH THAT WILL ADDRESS THE THE DIRE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED BY THE HEARING TODAY. AND I'D LIKE TO ASK MY ESTEEMED JOINT AUTHORS TO SAY A FEW WORDS AND IN SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT MEASURE SENATOR CENTER STERN. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS. I'LL BE BRIEF [inaudible] IS THE A PERSONAL AND MORAL CASE TO I THINK BE MADE ABOUT THE NEED TO ACT BOLDLY THIS YEAR. TERMS OF WHAT WORLD YOU WANT TO LEAVE OUR KIDS. AND HOW WE ACTUALLY WANTED STUART OUR LAND AND WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE. AND THEN THERE'S THE MECHANICS AND VERY BRIEFLY I AM EXCITED ABOUT THIS MEASURE BECAUSE I THINK THE DESIGN IS ELEGANT I DON'T THINK IT'S OVERLY HANDS ON AND PRESCRIPTIVE. ABOUT MICROMANAGING A PROCESS OR TRYING. TO DETERMINE WHAT OUTCOMES ARE THAT INDUSTRIES GOING TO INNOVATE AROUND I FRANKLY. INNOVATION RUN ANYTHING CRACKING IN FRACKING FIELDS IN OHIO RIVER VALLEY IS NOT A EXCITING TO ME AS NEW BUSINESSES POPPING UP ALL OVER THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA ACTUALLY SOLVE THIS PROBLEM. SO I THINK THIS SORT OF FRAMEWORK THAT YOU USED. TO FOR THIS REGULATORY AGENCY TO AT LEAST WORK WITH SOME FRAMEWORK AND NOT TRY TO DICTATE TOO MUCH FROM THE LEGISLATURE ABOUT WHAT THAT MIGHT LOOK LIKE -- IS A REALLY SMART DESIGN FOR THE FUTURE AND I THINK WE'RE GONNA SEE JOBS BE CREATED OUT OF HIS PROGRESS NOT LIMITED SO THANKS. YOU UP TO THE NORTH. CENTER SKINNER. THANK YOU -- THIS IS A VERY ESSENTIAL BILL. AT THIS PINT. IN OUR STATES. PROGRESS ON DEALING WITH WASTE. AND IN THE WORLD'S. I'M AS I REFERENCED EARLIER DURING THE HEARING. I DO HAVE A BIT OF A LONG I'M HISTORY ON THESE ISSUES AND I WAS PART OF A GROUP OF EOPLE THAT WROTE THE VERY FIRST 50% WASTE REDUCTION. ORDINANCE IN US WHICH WAS PASSED BY THE VOTERS A BERKELEY IN. NINETEEN EIGHTY FOUR AND WE DID THAT. BECAUSE STRONGLY ON THE BELIEF THAT RECYCLING. IN WASTE REDUCTION BUT MOSTLY RECYCLING COULD HELP US GET OUT OF OUR TRASH AND GARBAGE ISSUES. BUT AS TIME IS GOING ON WE HAVE REALIZED THAT WE IN WE HAVE INCREASINGLY. DEPENDENT ON MORE AND MORE PRODUCTS THAT ARE EITHER SINGLE USE ONLY OR NOT RECYCLABLE. ADDITIONALLY WE HAVE CONFRONTED THAT ARE RECYCLING MARKETS HAVE WE'VE ADDITIONALLY CONFRONTED THAT. OUR PRODUCTION OF THE SINGLE USE PRODUCTS IS HUGELY ENERGY INTENSIVE SO THUS CONTRIBUTING TO OUR CLIMATE CRISIS. AND POLLUTION OF ALL SORTS I'M. AND THAT OUR WHOLE RECYCLING SYSTEM. WHILE INITIALLY CONCEIVED AS SOMETHING THAT WAS WE COULD CALL ENERGY NEUTRAL. WAS DID NOT END UP BEING SO. IN OTHER WORDS THE BENEFIT OF COLLECTING MATERIAL IN REMANUFACTURING IS IT YOU ARE USING LESS ENERGY THAN MAKING THAT THAT PRODUCT FROM A RAW MATERIAL. THAT STILL THE CASE. FOR A FEW ITEMS BUT NOT MUCH NOW THERE IS SO. MUCH RESOURCES MEANING FOSSIL FUEL ANOTHER INVOLVED IN OUR WHOLE RECYCLING SYSTEM. OTHER THAN KEEPING WASTE OUT OF PERHAPS OUR MARINE ENVIRONMENT IT IS NOT GIVING US THE ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFIT. THAT WE FIRST. THAT OUR FIRST INTENTION WAS. SO WE CANNOT RECYCLE OURSELVES OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AND ESPECIALLY WE CANNOT RECYCLE OURSELVES OUT OF THIS PROBLEM. AS OUR USE OF MATERIALS THAT ARE NOT RECYCLABLE ENTER SINGLE USE ONLY KEEPS GROWING. NOW. I MENTIONED THAT I WAS PART OF THAT. GROUP THAT WROTE THAT FIRST ORDINANCE WHICH WAS PASSED IN. EIGHTY FOUR BY. NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE IN REALIZING THIS EVEN AS EARLY AS THEN WE THEN WROTE A SECOND VOTER INITIATIVE WHICH THIS. ALAMEDA COUNTY VOTERS PASSED. AND THAT INITIATIVE LED TO THE CREATION OF STOP WE START WORK BUT LET ME TELL YOU THE NAME OF THAT INITIATIVE WHICH VERY RARELY GETS REFERENCED ANYMORE. THAT INITIATIVE WAS CALLED THE SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING INITIATIVE AND WHAT IT CREATED WAS A SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING BOARD. SO STOP WASTE RENAMED ITSELF AND THAT'S A GREAT NAME. BUT ITS ORDINANCE NAME OR INITIATIVE NAME WAS SOURCE REDUCTION AND RECYCLING. AND THE SOURCE REDUCTION PART THE THING THAT NOT ONLY ALAMEDA COUNTY BUT ALL OTHER WERE UNITED STATES DOES NOT HAS NOT DONE TO THE DEGREE THAT EUROPE JAPAN AND OTHERS HAVE. AND THAT'S THE CHALLENGE WE HAVE NOW AND I'M SO PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL. AND I HAD BEEN CONTEMPLATING INTRODUCING A BILL BASED ON WHAT THE CITY OF BERKLEY TRUSTED IN RELATIONSHIP TO FAST FOOD PACKAGING AND SUCH BUT I THOUGHT YOU KNOW JUST AS MY COLLEAGUE SENATOR STERN REFERENCED. RATHER THAN CONTINUING TO GO AFTER JUST THIS PRODUCT OR THAT PRODUCT WHETHER IT'S A STYROFOAM CUP WERE PLASTIC BAG. WE NEED TO LOOK AT IT COMPREHENSIVELY WE NEED THAT VERY -- HOLISTIC VIEW. TOO BECAUSE THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE FOR EXAMPLE OF MY STAR FROM BEYOND AS THE AUTHOR OF THAT WAS THAT. CLAIM SHELLS THE THE STAR FROM CLEAR SHOWS WERE ELIMINATED BUT CLEAR PLASTIC ONES CAME IN IN PLACE. AND THEY WERE NOT RECYCLED AND THEY WERE NOT -- COMPOSTED AND THEY WERE JUST IN A WAY IS BAD. THEY DIDN'T HAVE THE HURT TO THE ATMOSPHERIC OZONE LAYER BUT ANYWAY SO WE SO THIS BILL IS ELEGANT. IN THAT IT DOESN'T JUST TARGET A SINGLE. PRODUCT BUT RATHER LOOKS COMPREHENSIVELY AT HOW WE CAN DO THE SOURCE REDUCTION THAT NOW IS OUR CHALLENGE IN WITH THAT. I THANK YOU AND URGE YOUR SUPPORT. ALL THANK YOU VERY MUCH LET'S ELEGANTLY OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING TO HEAR FROM PEOPLE IF THERE'S ANYBODY IN THE PUBLIC THAT'S IN SUPPORT OF THIS LEGISLATION WOULD LIKE TO ADDRESS THE COMMITTEE. PLEASE COME FORWARD. THIS IS. THIS IS SB. FIFTY FOUR A GOOD MORNING OF CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME'S MIKE CONDUCT -- AND I FOR THE PAST THREE DECADES I HAVE BEEN THE PRESIDENT AND CEO OF RECOLOGY. THE 100% EMPLOYEE OWNED RESOURCE RECOVERY COMPANY -- WE MANAGE RECYCLING COMPOSTING SOLID WASTE COLLECTION. PROCESSING DISPOSAL SERVICES FOR OVER ONE HUNDRED CAN URBAN SUBURBAN AND RURAL COMMUNITIES IN CALIFORNIA. WE HAVE TO BE THE LARGEST COME POSTERS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. RECALLS HIS MISSION REPRESENTS A FUNDAMENTAL SHIFT FROM TRADITIONAL WASTE MANAGEMENT TO RESOURCE RECOVERY. OUR VISION AT RECOLOGY IS TO CREATE A WORLD WITHOUT WASTE. BY DEVELOPING AND DISCOVERING SUSTAINABLE RESOURCE RECOVERY PRACTICES THAT CAN BE IMPLEMENTED GLOBALLY. THIS BEGIN BY RECOGNIZING THAT ONLY THROUGH PARTNERSHIPS CAN WE BUILD A CLOSED LOOP ECOSYSTEMS THAT. BOTH PROTECTS THE ENVIRONMENT AND SUSTAINS LOCAL COMMUNITIES. THIS IS WHAT MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR THE COMMUNITIES RECOLOGY SERVERS TO ACHIEVE HIGH LANDFILL DIVERSION AND MEET SUSTAINABILITY GOALS. NO WORDS WE'RE WE'RE IN THIS TOGETHER. FOR DECADES OVER RECALL THE IS CAPTURED PLASTIC MATERIALS THROUGH OUR RECYCLING PROGRAMS IN CALIFORNIA OREGON WASHINGTON STATE. AND MARKETED MUCH OF THAT MATERIAL FOR REUSE PRINCELY THROUGHOUT ASIA. WELL WHICH WE HAD A PLACE TO SEND PLASTICS -- FOR MANY RIGID PLASTIC CONTAINERS WERE STILL SUCCESSFUL IN FINDING MARKETS THESE MATERIALS THE REMAINDER RE MANUFACTURED INTO NEW PRODUCTS. HOWEVER MANY GLOBAL REFORMS OF MOST NOTABLY CHINA'S NATIONAL SOARED PROGRAM WHICH BAND MIXED PLASTIC IMPORTS. HAVE CLOSED NEARLY ALL AND MARKETS FOR PLASTIC PRODUCT PACKAGING PRODUCTS. EVEN FOR THE STORE WAS CLOSED WE STRUGGLED WITH WHAT TO DO AS MANY THE POLYMERS THAT ARE BEING INTRODUCED IN THE WASTE STREAM WITHOUT REGARD FOR SECONDARY USE MARKETS. WE FOLLOW THE WORK OF INNOVATIVE COMPANIES THAT HAVE ATTEMPTED TO REVERSE ENGINEER THE PLASTICS MANUFACTURING PROCESSAND RECLAIM THE PETROLEUM PRODUCTS WHICH THESE MATERIALS WERE CREATED. AND FORTY NONE OF THESE EFFORTS HAVE PROVEN SCALABLE. NOT WITH THE ENORMOUS INFLUX OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC. INTO THE MARKETPLACE. WE CAN TRY TO UNLOCK THE SECRET OURSELVES FOR FIVE YEARS RECALL THE EMPLOYEE TO A PEACH DPT CHEMICAL ENGINEER WITH TWENTY FIVE YEARS OF PLASTICS MANUFACTURING EXPERIENCE. GIVEN THE MISSION TO FIND SOMETHING TO DO THAT WE CAN DO A SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE. HIS WORK NOTED NO PRACTICAL RESULTS. THE SIMPLE FACT IS THERE'S JUST TOO MUCH PLASTIC AND TOO MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF PLASTICS BEING PRODUCED. IN THEIR EXIST FEW IF ANY IT'S FOR THE MATERIAL. WHICH MAKES REDUCE IMPOSSIBLE. THE PIT TIPPING POINT FOR ME PERSONALLY WAS WHEN SIXTY MINUTES AIRED. A POWERFUL SEGMENT ON PLASTIC WEEKS COUPLE MONTHS AGO AND ITS IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT. ALONG WITH THE EFFORTS TO CLEAN UP THE GREAT PACIFIC GARBAGE PATCH. THE PORTION THAT FEATURE WAS FILMED AT RECOLOGY USE THE RECYCLE CENTRAL FACILITY AT PIER NINETY SIX IN FRANCISCO THAT'S OUR LARGEST MOST TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED RECYCLING FACILITY. I CAME AWAY FROM WATCHING THAT STORY WITH THE ALMOST OVERWHELMING FEELING THAT WE'RE NEARLY OUT OF TIME AS THE PLANT PLANTS OCEANS AND WILDLIFE FOR INCREASINGLY OVERRUN BY PLASTIC WASTE. AND OUR COMPANY MY COMPANY WAS NOT DOING ENOUGH TO BE PART OF SOLUTION. SO I WROTE A PERSONAL LETTER TO CAL DOOLEY -- CEO THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL AND CHALLENGE THE PLASTIC INDUSTRY TO COME UP WITH A SCALABLE AND EFFECTIVE REFORMS THAT. ENSURE THAT SINGLE USE PLASTIC PRODUCTS ARE TRULY RECYCLED. IN OUR TRULY RECYCLED. ALSO TOLD THE PLASTIC INDUSTRY THEY DON'T WORK WITH COMPANIES LIKE US TO HELP FIND SOLUTIONS THAT WE WOULD SPONSOR A BALLOT INITIATIVE TO SEEKING TO BAN. SINGLE USE PLASTICS IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. WHAT WERE MY COLLEAGUES LIKES TO DESCRIBE IT -- THAT'S WHAT PEOPLE WITH TELLING PEOPLE TO LOOK LIKE TO DO THAT AND ALSO ALTER THIS I'M HERE TODAY TO SUPPORT -- SB FIFTY FOUR WHICH HAS THE PROMISE TO HELP DRIVE THE INDUSTRY TOWARDS THE END THIS NEEDED CHANGE BY REQUIRING PLASTIC ANOTHER SINGLE USE MATERIALS. FOLDING CALIFORNIA BE RECYCLABLE OR COMPOSTABLE BY. TWENTY THIRTY SB FIFTY FOUR ALSO SUCH AN IMPORTANT MILESTONE REQUIRING THE STATE'S RECYCLE OR OR OTHERWISE DIVERT FROM MATERIALS. FROM LANDFILLS 75% OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED IN CALIFORNIA. BY REQUIRING THE MANUFACTURE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC PACKAGING OR PRODUCTS AND SOLD OR DISTRIBUTED IN CALIFORNIA. TO DEMONSTRATE THE RECYCLING RATE OF AT LEAST TWENTY TWO AND A THE RECYCLE RELEASE 40% BY JUNE FIRST. TWENTY TWENTY SIX SB SEVEN FIFTY FOUR SET CLEAR GOALS REDUCE AND RECYCLE SINGLE USE MATERIALS. THAT WILL HELP COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AS WELL AS HER MARINE HABITATS. RECALL HE'S THIRTY SEVEN HUNDRED EMPLOYEE OWNERS ARE DEEPLY CONCERNED BY THE EFFECTS AND PROLIFIC PROLIFERATION OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC WASTE -- COMMITTED TO HELPING CALIFORNIA BECOME A LEADER ON THIS MATTER. JUST WANT TO ADD THAT DURING TO MY THIRTY YEARS AS C. E. OVER CALL HE WE'VE WE'VE WORKED WITH NUMEROUS INDUSTRIES TO TRY AND WORK WITH THEM TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THEIR PRODUCTS MORE CYCLE. IN OKAY SO FOR OF THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY HAS NOT BEEN ONE OF WE'LL HEAR FROM YOUR NEXT WITNESS WE HAVE DON'T GO FAR AWAY DESERVE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MAY HAVE QUITE. AND WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN BETWEEN NOW AND TWENTY TWENTY SECOND WITNESS I BELIEVE THERE'S A SECOND WITNESS [inaudible] COME ON GOOD AFTERNOON -- CHAIRMAN'S PLEASURE TO BE ON THE SIDE WITH YOU AND SENATORS THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY AND LINDA ESCALANTE WITH THE NATURAL RESOURCES DEFENSE COUNCIL. I'M HERE ON BEHALF OF NEARLY FOUR HUNDRED THOUSAND MEMBERS AND SUPPORTERS THAT WE HAVE IN CALIFORNIA. OUR MEMBERS IN THE STATE AND ACROSS THE NATION ARE PLAYING BEING CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE ISSUE OF PASTA POLLUTION IN OUR ENVIRONMENT. COASTAL AND INLAND COMMUNITIES ARE DISMAYED BY THE IMPACTS OF THIS POLLUTION AND WILDLIFE IN THE NEIGHBORHOODS PARKS WATERWAYS IN OF COURSE IN OUR OCEANS. ECOSYSTEMS. PEOPLE ARE ALSO ALARM ABOUT THE HEALTH CONCERNS. I'LL -- WITH MICHAEL PLASTICS LAST YEAR YOU ALL MIGHT HAVE HEARD FROM OVER SIX THOUSAND OF OUR MEMBERS. VIRGINIA TO SUPPORT THE STRAWS BY REQUEST BILL. HM AB EIGHTEEN EIGHTY FOUR ARE SHORT -- SOCIAL MEDIA VIDEO ON THIS PARTICULAR BILL WAS ONE OF THE MOST WATCHED LAST SUMMER ACROSS THE COUNTRY. OUR MEMBERS. ARE ALL IN DESPITE A TO BANDS SINGLE USE AT WORK IN THIS FIGHT TO ALL IN ON THE FIGHT A TO BAN THE SINGLE USE OF PLASTIC BAGS. AND WE ARE ALL IN IN SPITE AGAINST PLASTIC POLLUTION. WE HAVE ALSO SPENT YEARS WORKING WITH MUNICIPALITIES DEVELOPING ZERO WASTE PROGRAMS TO MOVE THEM AWAY FROM LANDFILLS AND INCINERATORS. IF YOU CREATE AS CLEAN SINGLE STREAM OF RECYCLABLES YOU CAN CREATE A CIRCULAR ECONOMY. HOWEVER IT IS CRITICAL TO REDUCE THE FEES FEEDSTOCK TO BEGIN WITH. OUR PLASTIC WASTE MUST GO SOMEWHERE BUT WE CAN NO LONGER CONTINUE EXPORTING OUR PROBLEM TECHNICIANS. HAVE A WORLD AWAY THE DOORS ARE CLOSING BECAUSE THEY'RE GETTING BURIED UNDER IT. THIS IS A MOMENT OF RECKONING. WE CAN'T KEEP BODY NATURAL SYSTEMS. WE CAN'T KEEP TRYING TO TRAP AND BURIED HER BURNETT. IT WILL CONTINUE TO DO THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO TAX CALIFORNIANS. OUR OWN STUDY FOUND A FEW YEARS AGO THAT OUR CITY SPEND WELL OVER FOUR HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS TO DEAL WITH MARINE DEBRIS. WHICH IS ONLY A FRACTION OF WHAT ACTUALLY ENDS UP IN THE OCEAN. HISTORICALLY MARGINALIZED COMMUNITIES HAVE ALSO BEEN PAIN WITH THEIR HEALTH. AND EVEN THEIR LIVES AS THEY HAVE BEEN BEARING THE BRUNT FOR OUT OF SIGHT OUT OF MIND MENTALITY. LANDFILLS AND INCINERATORS ARE ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL JUSTICE PROBLEM. SO IT IS. THE FACT THAT MORE PLASTIC PACKAGING NEEDS MORE TRACKS. DELIVERING OUR GOODS AND MARK KLEIMAN AN AIR POLLUTION. SOME STAGGERING STATISTICS 30% A PLASTIC PRODUCE IS USED IN PACKAGING AND THE MAJORITY IS ONLY USE ONES. LESS THAN 14% OF PLASTIC PACKAGING IS RECYCLED GLOBALLY. SB FIFTY FOUR IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF POLICY THAT GETS AT ADDRESSING THE ROOT OF THE PROBLEM BY CREATING INCENTIVES ARE INDUSTRY TO USE LESS PLASTIC PACKAGING IN THEIR PRODUCTS. BY MAKING THIS PACKAGING FULLY RECYCLABLE ENSURING THAT RECYCLING HAPPENS IN CREATING A CIRCULAR ECONOMY WHERE WE CAN REPURPOSE DOES. MATERIALS LOCALLY. AND CREATE THOSE JOBS LOCALLY. PLASTIC IS MATERIAL HOW CAN HAVE A USEFUL USEFUL APPLICATION LIKE AND HEALTH CARE. IT IS A NECESSITY BUT THE PROBLEM IS THAT WE ARE USING IT FOR EVERYTHING. CALIFORNIA HAS A RESPONSIBILITY TO LEAD. ON FACING OUT PLASTICS THAT ARE NOT REUSABLE RECYCLABLE ARE COMPOSED OF ALL. THE PUBLIC EXPLAIN CLOSE CLOSE ATTENTION TO THE SOLUTIONS TO PASS POLLUTION AIR COMING THAT NOW. FROMTHE EXTRACTION OF FOSSIL FUELS THE TRANSPORTATION TO DISPOSAL. THEY ARE POLLUTING OUR AIR WATER WILDLIFE AND PARKS BEACHES AND THEIR OWN BODIES. THIS WOULD NOT ONLY REDUCE PLASTIC TRASH ACOSTA MANAGING AND BUT IT WOULD CREATE JOBS LOCALLY PROTECTOR PRESSURE ENVIRONMENT. IN OUR LIVES THAT DEPEND ON IT THANK YOU ALL RIGHT NOW WE WILL OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING AND MAY I ASK PUBLIC MEMBERS OF THE PUBLIC. IF YOU HEARD SOMETHING DURING THE THE JOINT HEARING OR YOU'VE HEARD ONE OF THE WITNESSES HERE YOU AGREE WITH THEM. PLEASE JUST LET US KNOW THAT YOU AGREE WITH THEM AND NOT REPEAT THE EXACT SAME STATEMENT THAT THEY HAD. WE ARE AT THE THREE AND A HALF HOUR MARK SO I'D LIKE TO GET THROUGH THIS THIS PORTION OF THE PUBLIC HEARING. EFFICIENTLY MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MARK MURRAY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE I'D LIKE TO ECHO THE COMMENTS OF CENTER SKINNER AND THAT THIS IS AN ELEGANT BILL. WE HAVE DONE THIS BEFORE WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS KIND OF POLICY WE'VE DONE IN A PIECEMEAL BASIS THIS IS THE OPPORTUNITY TO DO IT IN A COMPREHENSIVE WAY. AVAILABLE FOR ANY TECHNICAL QUESTIONS AS WELL. MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MARKUP PRIOR WITH A PRE MAKAYLA ON BEHALF OF REPUBLIC SERVICES AND TO PARAPHRASE VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN. THIS IS A BIG DEAL AND WE'RE WHOLEHEARTEDLY IN SUPPORT OF SB FIFTY FOUR YEAH I LEFT ONE WORD OUT -- ARIS WANNA MAKE -- ONE ONE DATA POINT FOR THIS COMMITTEE EVERY DAY A SINGLE USE PACKAGING AND PRODUCTS GENERATE TONS OF WASTE IN CALIFORNIA. AS AN EXAMPLE FLEXIBLE PLASTICS ARE LESS THAN 4% OF OUR WASTE STREAM BY WEIGHT. YET THEY ARE EASILY 70% OF OUR PROBLEM IT'S SOLID WASTE PROCESSING FACILITIES. CONTAMINATING OTHERWISE RECYCLABLE MATERIALS AT OUR MATERIAL RECOVERY FACILITIES CLOGGING OUR EQUIPMENT AND CONTRIBUTING TO LITTER WE URGE YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU NEXT HI MY NAME IS COREY SELLABLE POLICIES AT A NOTED NOT COME UP THE FIRST TIME -- I I'M THE CO FOUNDER REPURPOSE WE ARE THE LEADING COMPANY WHERE TO THE RETAIL MARKET -- SO -- ONE OF THINGS I WANTED TO REPRESENT HIS BUSINESS WE ARE CALIFORNIA BASED BUSINESS OUR COMPANY IS AS I SAID THE LARGEST -- SELLER OF THESE PRODUCTS TO RETAIL CONSUMERS -- THIS IS BEEN A BUSINESS BOON FOR RETAILERS LIKE RALEY'S SAVE MART LUCKY SAFE WAY BUSINESSES IN CALIFORNIA WHO ARE MAKING. MONEY FROM OFFERING AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE PLASTIC IS ON THE SHELF IS ALSO OBVIOUSLY A PROFIT. OF FOR PROFIT COMPANY HOURS THAT BOYS FIFTEEN EMPLOYEES IN LOS ANGELES ALONG WITH NUMEROUS PEOPLE NATIONWIDE SO I HOPE TO REPRESENT THE INNOVATION AND THE COMPANIES THAT ARE GOING TO COME OUT OF BILLS LIKE THIS AND CONTINUE TO GROW FROM BILLS LIKE THIS WE ARE FULLY IN SUPPORT OF IT. AND ARE RESOURCE FOR ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE A QUESTIONS. THANK YOU NEXT.

HI GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE AND JUST LIKE WITH THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL -- YOU KNOW WE WE ARE LISTED AS OPPOSED TO THIS BILL WE'RE NOT OPPOSED. TO WHAT IS TRYING TO ACHIEVE I JUST WANT TO BE CLEAR ON THAT WE WE APPRECIATE THE APPROACH TO THIS BILL IS TAKING IN TERMS OF A YEAR SETTING A RECYCLING. GOAL. AND REQUIREMENTS AND HAVING INDUSTRY ACHIEVE THAT WE'VE SET OUR OWN RECYCLING GOALS. ANNOUNCED LAST YEAR THAT HUNTER PERCENT OF PLASTIC PACKAGING THE RECYCLE RECOVERABLE BY TWENTY THIRTY SO WE'RE NOT WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THIS. WHAT WHAT THE BILL'S TRYING TO ACHIEVE -- I DO WANT TO POINT OUT THOUGH THAT WE HAVE SOME QUESTIONS. AND CONCERNS ABOUT HOW THE BILL AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED AND HOW IT WOULD BE IMPLEMENTED -- THE SCOPE OF THE BILL IS UNCLEAR. THERE'S TERMS THAT ARE USED THAT WE DON'T THINK ARE INTERCHANGEABLE BUT THEY'RE USED THROUGHOUT THE THE BILL SINGLE USE PACKAGING. THING USE PRODUCTS SINGLE USE CONSUMER GOODS. IT'S AN ISSUE THAT I THINK WE NEED TO WE NEED TO ADDRESS IS AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD BECAUSE IT IS UNCLEAR OF THE UNIVERSE THAT WERE. WERE WERE LOOKING AT THE BILL DOES GRANT UNFETTERED AUTHORITY TO CAL RECYCLE TO DEVELOP IMPLEMENTING REGULATIONS AND IT'S SPECIFICALLY STOCKS ABOUT ANY OTHER REGULATIONS AND POLICIES AND DEPARTMENT DEEMS NECESSARY. THAT'S PRETTY OPEN ENDED -- IT'S A HUGE DELEGATION OF THE LEGISLATURE'S AND ARGUE OVER SIDE OF OF OF THIS ISSUE TO CAL RECYCLE. AND SO WE THINK THERE SHOULD BE SOME CLEAR GUIDELINES AND AN OVERSIGHT. BY THIS BODY AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD. IN TERMS OF THE THE TIME LINES A WE THINK PRACTICAL TIMELINES ARE NEEDED. I PERSONALLY DON'T THINK YOU CAN ACHIEVE A SCOPING PLAN OUT OF POWER CYCLE IN A ONE YEAR PERIOD. IT'S GOING TO TAKE TIME TO DEVELOP. INCREASED INFRASTRUCTURE -- MARKETS FOR SOME OF THIS MATERIAL SO I THINK AS THIS AS WE HAVE THESE CONVERSATIONS I THINK WE CAN WE CAN WE CAN CERTAINLY WORK ON THAT BUT I THINK AS IT AS CURRENTLY DRAFTED. IT'S DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE WHETHER OR NOT IT'S PRACTICAL TO ACHIEVE SO THAT WAS ANOTHER ISSUE THAT I WOULD WANT ONE HIGHLIGHT -- A LOT OF TALK ABOUT SOURCE REDUCTION. AGING SERVE A LOT OF PURPOSES IT HELPS ENSURE THAT PRODUCTS ARE DELIVERED TO THE CONSUMER -- IN A FASHION THAT THE THAT THAT IT'S SAFE IT'S EFFICIENT. THE PRODUCT GETS THERE IS NOT BROKEN THE ELIMINATING PACKAGING. I THINK MAY NOT NECESSARILY BE. TECHNOLOGICALLY POSSIBLE. SO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE I THINK WE HAVE. TO CONSIDER AS AS AS AS AS DISCUSSION -- CONTINUES -- THERE IS ALL ON THE BOOKS. A LAW LIKE OUR CYCLE HAS BEEN IMPLEMENTING SINCE THE EARLY NINETIES. THAT GOVERNS PLASTIC CONTAINERS OF EIGHT OUNCES OF FIVE GALLONS REQUIRING THEM TO CONTAIN A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED MATERIAL OR BE SOURCE PRODUCED -- A NUMBER OF COMPANIES HAVE BEEN COMPLYING WITH THAT LAW HAD BEEN INCREASING THE AMOUNT OF MATERIAL RECYCLE MATERIAL THAT THEY'RE USING IN THE PRODUCTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS. WE'RE NOT CLEAR HOW THIS BILL WOULD INTERSECT WITH THAT PROGRAM. ALSO THAT'S ANOTHER ISSUE THAT -- I THINK. DESERVE SOME ATTENTION -- AND AND CONVERSATION HAD TRY TO FIGURE THAT OUT. FIND SOMETHING I'LL MENTION IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE WERE. WE ARE COMMITTED. THE GETTING TO THESE THRESHOLD THAT HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED IN THE BILL. WE THINK THE BILL COULD BE IMPROVED AND IF IT'S BASED ON SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE FROM LAST SESSION WHICH WE SUPPORTED BRIDGES CENTER ROUNDS WORK ON THAT WITH US. THERE SHOULD BE A CHANGE IN THAT BILL A A STAKEHOLDER PROVISION THAT INVOLVES INDUSTRY. BY MENTAL GROUPS OTHERS PACKAGING ENGINEERS. IT'S GONNA REQUIRE THOSE THOSE PEOPLE TO BE INVOLVED IN THIS CONVERSATION. IT'S NOT CLEAR. THAT THAT IS OUTLINED IN THE BILL AND WE THINK THERE WAS CERTAINLY NEEDS TO BE IMPROVED SO WITH THAT -- WE ARE LISTED AS OPPOSED THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE'RE NOT INTERESTED IN WORKING ON FINDING A SOLUTION WE'RE VERY MUCH INTERESTED IN THAT -- WE'RE COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND LOOK FOR THE WORKING WITH ALL THE AUTHORS ON ON ON THIS -- ON THIS PROPOSALS AND MOVED THANK YOU. OUR NEXT WITNESS. AGAINST. MR MEMBERS -- JOE ACTOR FOR PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION. MR SHOULD STICK OUTLINED THE SAME CONCERNS WE HAVE IS A COALITION -- WE WORKED OF CENTER AL LAST YEAR IT S. P.. THIRTEEN THIRTY SB THIRTEEN THIRTY FIVE AND CAME SUPPORT. I THINK WE'RE IN A UNIQUE POSITION TO OFFER YOU INPUT AND SOLUTIONS BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING IS I'VE BEEN TOLD TODAY WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION. WE'RE DEDICATED TO IT. AND WE'RE LOOKING FOR TO WORK OF ALL THREE AUTHORS. AND THAT INPUT FROM MINISTRIES BY VERY VALUABLE WE HAVE TO DO IT. LET'S OPEN UP THE PUBLIC HEARING THOSE OPPOSED PLEASE COMPORT. BENETTON JACOB CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL CALIFORNIA -- I JUST LIKE TO ECHO THE SAME -- CONCERNS OVER THE BILL IN ITS AND HOW THAT'S TO BE. WHITTLE DOWN AND AND REALLY FOCUSED. NICKEL CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION WE ALSO HAVE AN OPPOSE LESS AMENDED POSITION AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH ALL STAKEHOLDERS THINK. GOOD AFTERNOON KATIE HANSON WITH THE CALIFORNIA RESTAURANT ASSOCIATION WE HAVE AN OPPOSE POSITION ON THE BILL FOR THE REASONS STATED. AFTERNOON MANUALLY ON BEHALF OF THE PERSONAL CARE PRODUCTS COUNCIL ECHOING A LOT OF THE CONCERNS OF THE PREVIOUS SPEAKERS. OUR MEMBERS ARE ACTUALLY PRETTY ACTIVE IN THE SPACE WHERE OR VISIT A PARTICIPANT IN A COALITION CALLED SPICE WHICH IS THE SUSTAINABLE PACKAGING INITIATIVE IN COSMETICS. THEY WERE DOING A LOT IN THE SPACE TO LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH THE AUTHORS ON A SOLUTION. GOOD AFTERNOON LARISSA ASSESSMENT AS ODD BEHALF OF THE TôI ASSOCIATION AND WE ENDORSE THE COMMENTS MADE BY A CC AND MR SACK STEAK AND APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE OFFICE. HIGHER MARIN ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SINCERE COMMENTS WITH A MISTER SUSPECT MAKE CLEAR THAT EVEN THOUGH THE ANNOUNCES HAS THAT C. G. OPPOSE THE BILL OUR POSITION IS A PUZZLE CEMENTED FOR THE SAME REASON STAND BY SUSPECT LOOK. FOR TO WORK ON THE CHAIR AND OTHER AUTHORS ON A CRAFTING A SOLUTION THAT IS -- NOW WORKABLE FOR EVERYBODY INVOLVED THANK YOU VERY MUCH. AFTERNOON ADAM RARELY ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WE SUPPORT THE OPPOSE UNLESS -- AMENDED POSITION OF TIM SHASTA NACC FOR THE REASONS STATED -- BUT WE DO RECOGNIZE THE OR POLICY AND OUR ABILITY TO RECYCLE HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA SO WE HOPE TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR AND FIND A WAY FOR THANK YOU. JOHN YOU IT ON BEHALF THE GROCERY MANUFACTURERS ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO OPPOSED THIS TIME FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED REASONS THANK YOU. OKAY LET'S CLOSE THE PUBLIC HEARING AND BRING IT BACK TODAY YES -- LET'S LET'S. MOVE FORWARD TO JANUARY ONE TWENTY TWENTY THE BILL AS IN ITS FOR ITS FORM OR FOR NOW REQUIRES RECYCLING RATE OF NOT LESS THAN HOW DO YOU FOLKS ANTICIPATE THAT BEING CALCULATED AND I GUESS SOME OF THE OP IF IF I MAKING PLASTIC SOMETHING AND I'VE GOT CONTENT DOES THAT. THIS SET MEET THE THRESHOLD OR IS IT AN AGGREGATE IN ALL PLASTICS BECAUSE THIS IS A SOURCE REDUCTION [inaudible] GOAL. ZERO ZERO TWO SO THE ISSUES RAISED BY MR SUSPECT AND YOU KNOW AND AND THAT ARE THERE RIGHT AT THE HEART OF YOUR QUESTION. CAN I SPEAK TO THE THE MODEL THIS BILL AND WE WE REALLY ARE. CONCRETING BROAD GUIDELINES THAT THAT ADDRESS THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN RAISED THIS MORNING WITH REGARDS TO THIS PROBLEM THAT WE HAVE AS A SOCIETY. AND THEN ASKING CAL RECYCLE WHO ARE THE EXPERTS IN THIS AREA TO COME UP WITH. THE REGULATIONS TO TAKE TAKE TO MEET THE GOALS THAT ARE LAID OUT IN THE IN THE BILL SO. I GUESS I'M AYE. THE THEIR IT IT'S IT'S PURPOSEFULLY. ARE NOT AS SPECIFIC AS YOU'RE ASKING FOR BECAUSE WE WANT THERE TO BE A PROCESS THAT DOES INVOLVE STAKEHOLDERS AND BY THE WAY DID SPEAKING TO MISTER I SUSPECT CONCERNS THERE IS A STICKLER PROCESS. AND WE CERTAINLY WANT TO TALK TO HIM ABOUT ON STRENGTHENING IF THAT'S A CONCERN. BUT BUT WE WE ARE ULTIMATELY THE EXPERTS THERE. TO TO FIGURE OUT AND PROMULGATE RULES THAT WILL ARE THAT THEY WILL ADDRESS THE BROAD GO OUT I OUTLINED. GOALS OF THIS BILL. AND SO I I A I KNOW YOU'RE ASKING FOR SPECIFICITY AND WE PURPOSELY ARE PROVIDING SPECIFICITY BECAUSE WE'RE GETTING. BEN TO DO IT. SOME WOULD SAY ELEGANTLY NOT RIGHT ESPECIALLY IF I IF I COULD ADD. THINGS WITH HER IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT -- IF WE IF THE BILL IS CRAFTED TO BE MORE DIRECTIVE. THEN WE COULD BE IN THE SITUATION WHERE WE END OF WHERE WE FOR EXAMPLE SAID WILL STOP THE USE OF THIS STOP USE OF SAY STAR PHONES STOP USE OF THE PLASTIC BAG [inaudible] WITH OUT [inaudible] WHEN WE? WE DON'T KNOW YET WHAT THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF THAT IS SO THE BENEFIT OF ALLOWING OUR REGULATORY AGENCY. TO ENGAGE IN THIS AND START TO DEVELOP RAGS IS TO ALLOW. FOR MORE THOUGHT ABOUT WHAT THE POTENTIAL UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF ACTION X. OR Y. IS. SO WHEN YOU THINK ABOUT -- EVEN AB THIRTY TWO HAD AB THIRTY TWO BEEN WRITTEN. RATHER IT WAS WRITTEN TO EXPRESS OUR GOAL AND TO GIVE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD THE ABILITY TO FIGURE OUT HOW BEST TO MEET THAT GOAL IF IT HAD BEEN WRITTEN. INSTEAD GO AFTER THIS SOURCE OF GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IT MAY HAVE COMPLETELY NOT FACTORED THE FACT THAT WHAT WE NOW KNOW. THAT OUR BLACK CARBON IS. IT IS S. SUCH A SIGNIFICANT GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTER. WHICH NOW THE AGENCY OF COURSE IS REGULATING SO. I THINK WHAT ARE. WHEN I WAS SAYING THE WORD ELEGANT IT REALLY WAS WHAT I MEANT IS THAT IT'S RATHER THAN US TRYING TO PREDETERMINE? WHAT THE SPECIFIC RIGHT APPROACHES WHEN WE HAPPEN FACTORED THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCES OF THAT SPECIFIC RATE APPROACH OR WHETHER THE MARKETS EXIST OR WHETHER THERE'S FACILITY THAT CAN RE MANUFACTURED THAT MATERIAL? THAT'S REALLY RECYCLING CLOSING THE LOOP. WOULD BE A MISTAKE AND SO THE EIGHT IT'S GIVING THE ABILITY FOR THE AGENCY TO DO THAT WHO HAS THE ABILITY TO LOOK AT THE STATE OF THE MARKETS THE LOOK AT THE STATE OF PRODUCTION FACILITIES IN CALIFORNIA -- THE U. S. THE STATE OF THE MATERIALS IN ALL OF THE REST OF IT. BUT SHE ALSO JUST TALKING BOUT LEAKAGE BECAUSE IF YOU BàN SOMETHING HE COULD HAVE TO CREATE SOMETHING ELSE I MEAN IT'S SORT OF LIKE -- CENTER HILL IN THE CUP RIGHT YOU KNOW BASELINE PROVISIONS AN IMPORTANT ONE TO UNDERSTAND IS HOW TO ACTUALLY UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM AND THE AMENDMENTS THAT -- WERE WERE ADDED -- IN THE MOST RECENT ROUND ABOUT DETERMINATION OF WHAT IS TRULY SINGLE USE BECAUSE WE HEARD FROM SOME OF THE TESTIMONY WE DON'T EVEN KNOW IT CAN BE USED. ONCE OR TWICE RIGHT I MEAN THAT'S INVOLVING AND THE ONES IN THE TO SLIDE YOU SOMETIME AND AND THE LABELING IS TRICKY SO. IT'S TO TO ACTUALLY SCOPE THAT AND GET A BASELINE OF WHAT THE SCOPE OF SINGLE USE PLASTIC SO ARE IN THE STATE IN THAT DEFINITION PROCESS I THINK IS CENTERS THAT IS PURPOSELY -- SORT OF DEFERENTIAL IN SOME WAYS TO THE PROCESS AND WE'RE OPEN ONCE YOU GET A SENSE THAT BASS LINE AND YOU CAN ACTUALLY HAVE HIT A 20% TARGET IN A IN A REASONABLE FASHION AS YOU'RE MENTIONING BUT IT'S HARD. TO APPROACH CENTER YOU KNOW THE SCOPE OF THE I THINK THE INVENTORY AND THEN YOU AND YOU KNOW IN WITH THIS THAT WE DID WITH CLIMATE RIGHT YOU START WITH A GREENHOUSE GAS HIM TOWARD. INS IN FULL SCOPE AND THEN YOU CAN ACTUALLY ABOUT ME I'M CURRENTLY OPTIMISTIC I KNOW GOVERNOR BROWN SPENT THREE YEARS MEETING WITH STAKEHOLDERS AND RECYCLING ISSUE SO WHY NOT LET'S GET DONE IN A YEAR ESSENTIALLY THIS WRITTEN A WELL NO BUT WITH. THE THE 20% RATED BY. TWENTY TWENTY TWO AND THEN IN A KIND OF GOES UP FROM THERE SO SO NOT NOT WHEN YOU'RE BUT BUT BUT ESSENTIALLY THIS IS THIS IS ABOUT ADDRESSING THE ISSUE THAT WE CAME UP BEFORE THAT THAT THAT CENTER HERE ALLUDED TO THAT. A LOT OF THINGS SAY RECYCLABLE AND I THINK JERRY HELL WAS LOOKING AT THE PRODUCT -- BUT THE QUESTION IS EASY TO ACTUALLY BEING COLLECTED AND IS IT BEING TURNED INTO ANOTHER PRODUCT THAT THAT'S WHAT RECYCLING RATE MEANS MAKING SURE THAT WE ACTUALLY. ARE YOU KNOW WE ACTUALLY GIVE REAL TANGIBLE MEANING TO THE LABELING ON THESE PRODUCTS. IT IT'S ALL IT'S ABOUT NOT WHETHER IT IS IT RECYCLABLE BUT IS IT ACTUALLY GETTING RECYCLED AND TURNED INTO A INTO INTO A USABLE PRODUCT. CENTER BATES GET OUT HERE. THANK YOU OF SENATOR WITH COFFEE FOR COVERING FOR ME WHILE I WAS AT A BUNCH OF OTHER MEETINGS LATE ANYWAY -- I JUST LIKE TO MAKE A STATEMENT FIRST THAT I THINK WHAT WE HAVE HERE -- IN THE ISSUE IS INDISPUTABLE ARE THE PROBLEM THAT WE'RE FACING WITH THE PLASTIC POLLUTION INDISPUTABLE. BUT I THINK WHAT YOU PRESENTED HERE HAVE A DISPUTED BOWL. COMPONENT TO IT AND I THINK THE FIRST I THINK IT'S TROUBLING AND WILL BE TROUBLING TO OUR CONSTITUENCY IS A DEFINITION OF SINGLE USE BECAUSE WE HAVE TOYS AND THOSE OF YOU WHO ARE NEW FATHER. AND ALL OF THAT YOU KNOW HOW MUCH -- YOU KIND OF BRING AND YOU CAN'T BELIEVE THAT YOU GOT THIS WHOLE NEW ROOM FULL OF STUFF AND A LOT OF ITS PLASTIC IN IT IT IS THOUGHT. IT IS PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH IF A PRODUCT RATHER THAN A PACKAGING HERE SO I THINK THAT THE FOCUS THAT WILL BE MORE COMFORTABLE IN TERMS OF WE GOING FORWARD IS TO BE FOCUSING ON IS THAT A PRODUCT AND THIS WAS A DIRECTIVE TO CAL RECYCLE BASICALLY. I IS THAT A PRODUCT OR IS THE PACKAGING ABOUT. I THINK RECYCLE -- CAL RECYCLE NEEDS TO PROVIDE SOME TESTIMONY HERE IN TERMS OF HOW THEY WILL DEAL WITH THIS NEW ASSIGNMENT THEY HAVE MANY OF YOU KNOW. WE HAVE THE WILDFIRE ISSUE AND HOW RECYCLING ALL THAT OUT SO I'M JUST CAUTIONING WHEN THIS GETS TO APPROPRIATIONS ON EITHER SIDE OF THIS HOUSE. AND WE HEAR DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE DODD PHAGES FOR THE BEGINNING WE NEED TWO HUNDRED NEW EMPLOYEES AND FIVE HUNDRED MILLION MORE DOLLARS -- IS IT WORTH IT WELL I THINK WHEN YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PROBLEM I THINK THAT THE CAR OFF TO SOMETHING. THAT WE SHOULDN'T YOU KNOW BE DIMINISHED IN TERMS OF GOING FORWARD TO TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM BUT I THINK YOU NEED TO BE VERY FOCUSED ON THAT AND PERHAPS THAT REQUIRES PHASING. OF WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO WITH THIS BECAUSE IT'S VERY CONCRETE. THAT BREAKING INTO PHASES SO THAT IF SOMETHING THAT DOABLE IN THE SHORT TERM AND THE LONG TERM IS WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO GET OUT VERY IMPORTANT. YOU GUYS ARE GOING TO HEAR FROM ME OVER AND OVER AGAIN ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT PEOPLE ARE INVOLVED. WE ARE HERE TO REPRESENT PEOPLE AND THAT'S TRANSLATED AS STAKEHOLDERS AND YOU HEARD FROM THEM THAT WE NEED STAKEHOLDERS BECAUSE THEY CAN GIVE US GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY ON THE DEFINITION OF SINGLE USE PACKAGING VERSUS PRODUCT. FOUNDED THOSE WILL MAKE ME VERY COMFORTABLE I'M JUST GONNA LAY OFF TODAY BECAUSE I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT WE'RE STARTING TO TALK ABOUT IT IN THE IN THE BIGGER SOUNDS I HAVE A COASTAL DISTRICT. AND I I I'M BORN AND RAISED HERE IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA ALSO THE OCEAN IS PRECIOUS AND WE ALL KNOW THAT YOU KNOW WE WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT IT. BUT LET'S DO IT RIGHT BECAUSE WE'RE GIVING AN AGENCY TOTAL pLONG IT DID TAKE A LONG TIME SENATOR WHITE HOUSE GIVER AB. THIRTY TWO BUT IT WASN'T A BAD THING THAT WE TOOK THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF TIME SO WE GOT GOOD DEFINITIONS. AND THEY WERE NOT DISPUTED WILL AT THE AGENCY LEVEL SO THEY HAD TO HAVE CONTINUAL HEARINGS AND MORE MORE PEOPLE AND ALL OF THE THINGS THAT GO ON WE WANT PEOPLE TO BE WITH OFF ON DEAF. AND ESPECIALLY I'M SPEAKING FOR MYSELF INDIVIDUALLY IN THE CONSTITUENCY I REPRESENT I WANT THEM TO BE WITH ME. AND WE HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT THIS DOES TO OUR ECONOMY INTO BUSINESS. THEY'VE GOT TO BE A STRONG VOICE ENOUGH AND I THINK THE PARTNERSHIP THAT THE HOUSE ADJUSTING THE SOMETHING THAT I CERTAINLY EMBRACE SO -- I WILL LAY OFF TODAY AND HOLD ON WHEN THE KIDS MIGHT HAVE COMMITTEE WHICH WOULD BE THUNDERSTONE. THANK YOU [inaudible] MISTER CHAIR. SANDERS THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP -- IT WAS -- A TIMELY CONSIDERING THE SESSION WE HAVE BEFORE AND LEARNING ABOUT THE SCOPE OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN OUR IN OUR OCEANS -- I SHARE SOME OF THOSE SAME CONCERNS IS -- MY COLLEAGUES ARE FORMER LEADER IN THE STATE SENATE I'M CONCERNED ABOUT DEFINITIONS -- ESPECIALLY PACKAGING -- YOU KNOW I'M IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS -- SOME PACKAGING IS VERY UNIQUE TO SOME VERY SENSITIVE -- PRODUCTS THAT. NEED TO BE STERILE WHEN THEY'RE WHEN THE DAY THAT THE BENEFICIARIES NAMELY THE SURGEONS -- RECEIVE THEM -- MY COMPOUNDING PHARMACY ACTUALLY PUTS TOGETHER -- PRODUCTS. OF THAT HER KIDS THAT ARE USED FOR SURGICAL PROCEDURES OF THE THE PACKAGING IS VERY VERY UNIQUE -- I HAVE TO SAY THAT I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT GIVING US SO MUCH AUTHORITY TO CAL RECYCLE -- TO DETERMINE THAT THE REGULATIONS THAT ARE GOING TO BE NEEDED AND I'M HOPING THAT -- THE LEGISLATURE WILL HAVE SOME. OVERSIGHT AND CODIFICATION AND ECONOMIC STUDIES ASSOCIATED WITH SOME OF THOSE. THOSE REGULATIONS AND CERTAINLY COULD COST TO THAT AGENCY THAT -- IS IT. AT HAS DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE CHALLENGES IN THE PAST -- I AM ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE SCOPING PERIOD A TIME OF YEAR -- I THINK EVEN THE AUTHORS BY THE WAY THEY WERE KIND OF SHAKING THEIR HEAD -- REALIZE THAT THAT A YEAR IS AN AWFULLY OVERZEALOUS -- PERIOD A TIME WHEN YOU CONSIDER HOW LONG IT TOOK FOR THE AB THIRTY TWO SCOPING TO COME ABOUT THIS IS PROBABLY GOING TO BE AS COMPREHENSIVE -- AS AS THAT -- SO -- THE LAST THING I WANT TO SUGGEST IS THAT -- THE STAKEHOLDERS WE DON'T REALLY NEED A SEAT AT THE TABLE. AND I REALLY WANT TO SUPPORT YOUR BILL -- BUT I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE THE STAKEHOLDERS OF REPRESENT SOME VERY IMPORTANT PRODUCTS -- REPRESENT A LOT OF MANUFACTURING JOBS -- IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA -- THAT WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE -- PUTTING THEM OUT OF BUSINESS -- WITHOUT HAVING THEM HAVING THE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SIT DOWN AND SHARE THEIR CONCERNS AND AND MAYBE EXTEND SOMETIME LINE SO THAT THEY CAN IN FACT -- TAKE SOME OF THE SINGLE USE. ITEMS THAT ARE NOT RECYCLABLE AT THIS TIME AND MAYBE FIND WAYS TO RECYCLE THEM ESPECIALLY WHEN THE EMBARGO -- TONIGHT SAID TO BE THE OVER TO CHINA EXIST I LOOK FOR TO THE DEFINITION SO LOOK FORWARD TO THE STAKEHOLDERS HOPEFULLY BY BECOMING MORE INVOLVED AND BEING PART OF THE SOLUTION. AND I LIKE MY COLLEAGUE WHAT WILL LAY OFF AT THIS POINT IN TIME -- AND I HOPE TO SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS BECAUSE I REALLY THINK THE THE WORK THAT YOU'RE DOING IS IMPORTANT. CENTER HEALTH THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR AND THANK YOU FOR THE THE LEGISLATURE SPECIALLY AFTER WHAT WE'VE LEARNED ALL MORNING IT'S IT'S PHENOMENAL -- AND I'M HAPPY TO SUPPORT IT AND AND WANT TO MOVE IT FORWARD I JUST REMEMBER AND AND MY COLLEAGUE -- MENTIONED THE A. B. THIRTY TWO AND I REMEMBER WHEN I WAS ON CARBON WE WERE DOING THE SCOPING PLAN BACK TEN YEARS AGO ELEVEN YEARS AGO. WE STARTED IT IN SOME OF THE ISSUES THAT CAME TO LIGHT WERE THOSE OF THE ROAD TIME LINES AND HOW DO WE ESTABLISH AN MEET THOSE TIME LINES FOR THE THROUGH REGULATION OR THROUGH LEGISLATION. AND A LOT OF IT IS DONE IT WAS KIND OF TECHNOLOGY FORCING -- AND I GUESS MY ONLY CONCERN AN ISSUE THAT I HOPE YOU LOOK AT IS IT MOVES FORWARD IS. IS ARE THESE TIME LINES REALISTIC CAN THE TECHNOLOGY BE THERE CAN INDUSTRY DO IT TO ME I WANT TO MAKE SURE WE GET THERE AND WE CAN DO IT IN THAT TIME LINE. BUT I ALSO WANT TO BE REALISTIC WITH THAT AS WELL AS IN MOST BY CENTER HAS. OUR CO AUTHOR. YEAH WELL -- FOR EVERYBODY FOR THE GREAT DISCUSSION I WANT TO THANK ALL THE ADVOCATES AS WELL ON BOTH SIDES WHO CAME IN PARTICIPATED VERY VERY VALUABLE -- FEEDBACK LET ME JUST ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS THAT HAVE BEEN REYES FIRST OF ALL ON THE CENTER STONE WHERE TO GO -- HE'S ARIA OKAY A WAY FOR HIM TO COME BACK -- WELL UP WELL SINCE HE'S HOPEFULLY HE WILL HEAR FROM AFAR -- WE ACTUALLY DO SPECIFICALLY I EXACT MEDICAL MEDICAL DEVICES AND THAT'S ON PAGE SIX OF YOUR BILL ONLINE. TWENTY NINE THERE'S ALSO LANGUAGE WE SPECIFICALLY REFERRING TO THE CONVENING OF A STAKEHOLDER GROUP. TO ASSIST THE DEPARTMENT IN DEVELOPING THE PLAN -- AND THAT'S ON PAGE -- SEVEN SO THAT THAT THAT THAT WE CAN CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT IF IF FOLKS YOU KNOW IF IF THERE'S OF SERIOUS CONCERN ABOUT ONE YEAR% SCOPING PLAN AND WE WE GOT RIGHT TWO YEARS TO GET THE SMOKING COMING PLAN I I DON'T THINK THAT'S ONLY THAT WOULD HARM THE THE CORE. GOAL OF THE BILL WHILE ALSO ADDRESSING THE THE TIME FRAME ISSUES HAVE BEEN RAISED BUT THE KEY THING I NEED TO NEED TO MENTION IN RESPONSE TO YOUR COMMENTS SENATOR IS THAT THIS IS FILLED WITH THE THAT. IT REALLY DOES RECOGNIZE THAT IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO THINK THROUGH AND DEVELOP THE POLICIES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS. AND YOU KNOW OF COURSE A LOT OF THE ADVOCATES SAY THAT'S FAR TOO LONG GIVEN THE YOU KNOW THE URGENCY OF THE PROBLEMS HERE BUT WE REALLY DO WANT TO MAKE SURE THIS IS SOMETHING IS WORKABLE. I MEAN ULTIMATELY ULTIMATELY GUYS THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT. THIS IS NOT JUST ABOUT WASTE REDUCTION IN CALIFORNIA RIGHT IT'S ABOUT WASTE REDUCTION GLOBALLY AND IT'S ABOUT TRYING TO SHOW THE WORLD THAT WE CAN DO THIS RIGHT WE CAN FIND A WAY TO BE ECONOMICALLY VIABLE AND DO RIGHT BY OUR ENVIRONMENT AND HELP TO SHOW THE REST OF THE WORLD. THAT THAT THERE'S A BETTER WAY OF ADDRESSING THESE -- PACKAGING I CHALLENGES THAT WE ALL HAVE AS A AS A AS A HUMAN SPECIES SO SO SO IT IS A VERY IMPORTANT TO US THAT THIS BE DONE -- IN A IN A WAY THAT ACTUALLY -- IS IS IS VERY FUNCTIONAL WITH REGARDS TO OUR OUR ECONOMIC VITALITY QUALITY LIFE I JUST WANT TO MENTION CENTER STONE THAT MEDICAL DEVICES ARE SPECIFICALLY EXEMPTED FROM THIS -- ON PAGE SIX OF THE BILL AND THERE WE WERE TO RAMP UP ASSOCIATED WITH THE GENERAL IMITATION THE BILL. I SO HOPE THAT THOSE WILL ADDRESS SOME OF THE CONCERNS AND WE CAN CERTAINLY TALK ABOUT -- OTHER THINGS LIKE EXPANDING THE TIME. TOWARD TOWARD THE RELEASE OF THE SCOPING PLAN MAYBE TWO YEARS AND THAT THOSE ARE THOSE ARE ABSOLUTE CONVERSATIONS WERE WILLING AND ABLE AND AND HAPPY TO HAVE WITH WITH THE SENATORS.

WE WANT TO START BY THANKING SENATOR MONNING FOR HIS EFFORTS TO CHAMPION DRINKING WATER SOLUTIONS. PARTICULARLY OVER THE LAST THREE YEARS STARTING WITH SB SIX TWO THREE AND TWENTY SEVENTEEN THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS HAVE GONE A LONG WAY. TO A CONSENSUS THAT THERE IS A DRINKING WATER CRISIS IN THIS STATE. AND TWENTY NINETEEN APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS LACK ACCESS TO SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. AND THERE ARE CURRENTLY OF MORE THAN THREE HUNDRED COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS THAT ARE OUT OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE PRIMARY DRINKING WATER STANDARD. THIS IS ABSOLUTELY UNACCEPTABLE AND TWENTY NINETEEN ADDITIONALLY THAT THERE ARE NEARLY TWO MILLION PEOPLE IN THE STATE THAT ARE NOT SERVED BY COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. THESE ARE HOUSEHOLDS SCHOOLS COMMUNITIES SERVED BY PRIVATE WELLS AND STATE SMALL WATER SYSTEMS A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE WELLS WE KNOW. ARE CONTAMINATED AND DON'T PROVIDE SAFE DRINKING WATER. THE SOLUTION WHICH SENATOR MONNING HAS OUTLINED IS CLEAR THE STATE. MUST ESTABLISH A PERMANENT AND RELIABLE FUNDING SOURCE THAT CAN BE USED FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS AND OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE.

FOR YOUR PRESENT MY ANY OPPOSITION IN MAY BE OUT THERE WEINER'S BOOKS ONE RAISE CONCERNS. OKAY SO THE ITEMS OF ON THE ITEM IS NOW BEFORE THE COMMITTEE FOR QUESTIONS LOTS -- AS CENTER STONE PUBLIC CENTER WITH US THANK YOU -- CENTER MONNING THANK YOU FOR YOUR ON GOING LEADERSHIP ON THIS I KNOW THERE'S BEEN A PASSION OF YOURS AND I APPRECIATE ALL THE SPEAKERS THIS BOOK FROM ALL OVER THE STATE -- TO TO TO THE MAN AND RIGHTFULLY SO HAVE CLEAN DEPENDABLE DRINKING WATER -- THE ONLY THING THAT'S MISSING THAT I SEE AND THE BILL HAS YOU KNOW HOW MUCH MONEY WE'RE TALKING ABOUT AND HOW WE CAN PAY. FOR SO AS I MENTIONED IN THE OPENING. NEGOTIATIONS CONTINUE THE GOVERNOR STRONGLY SUPPORTING THIS EFFORT THE LEADERS OF BOTH OF OUR HOUSES. AND SO THE FUNDING MECHANISM IS THIS SUBJECT OF ONGOING NEGOTIATIONS THE PURPOSE OF THIS PRESENTATION IS WE CAN MOVE FORWARD. ESTABLISHING THE FUNDING MECHANISMS IN THE ADMINISTRATIVE ARCHITECTURE FEW WILL IN IT WILL BE A TRANSPARENT PROCESS. AS WE ACHIEVE THOSE BENCHMARKS FOR FUNDING -- IT'LL BE SHARED WITH WITH COMMITTEES AND WITH BUDGET MANY OKAY I I APPRECIATE MARRY I DO APPRECIATE YOUR EFFORTS. MY CONCERN IS ALWAYS BEEN IN THE PAST IS THAT -- YOU KNOW WE HAVE A TWENTY ONE BILLION DOLLAR BUDGET OVER WHAT THE COST WAS THE BILL LAST YEAR I THINK WAS LESS THAN A HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS ABOUT A HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE TWO HUNDRED THIRTY FIVE MILLION. I MEAN IF IF WE KNEW TODAY IT WAS GONNA COME OUT OF GENERAL FUND AS AN ONGOING ALLOCATION I BE PUTTING MY YES BUT ON THIS AND IN A MINIMAL SECOND. MY MY CONCERN AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT SOME PEOPLE ARE WILLING TO TAX THEMSELVES -- AGAIN THIS IS ANOTHER REGRESSIVE A LOT OF PEOPLE THAT LIVE IN MY DISTRICT. NEAR POVERTY LEVELS AND WHAT WOULD FIND IT VERY DIFFICULT -- COMING CLEAN MORE MONEY EXXON AGAIN THE FUNDING MECHANISM IS NOT WHAT'S BEFORE US TODAY. BUT THE MODEL THAT THE GOVERNOR'S TRAILER BILL ADDRESSES DOES EXEMPT POOR PEOPLE UP 22100% OF THE FEDERAL POVERTY LINE. SO IN TERMS YOUR CONCERNS ABOUT OUR GROUP PROGRESSIVE TAX AND IF I COULD JUST TAKE THIS OPPORTUNITY I APPRECIATE YOUR ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THE PEOPLE WHO'VE TRAVELED HERE MANY TIMES. I ALSO WANT TO OFFER MY THINKS THROUGH THE CHAIR PEOPLE WHO HAVE TRAVELLED HERE MANY TIMES THEY WAITED. ALL DAY FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD THEIR NAME IN A ME -- TOO THEY'VE TRAVELED A LONG DISTANCE AS WELL AND WE THANK THEM FOR THEIR PRESENCE. THANK YOU MISTER I'M GONNA WITHHOLD MY VOTE IN COLOR SEE THE FUNNY MAKE A GREAT INTENTIONS THANK YOU SENATOR THANK YOU SIR. I SAN KASKI SENATOR I FOR YOU AND MANY OF THE WITNESSES COMMENTED ABOUT. I SENATOR OR ASSEMBLY MEMBER SCHEMES BILL FIVE YEARS AGO THAT ESTABLISH THE HUMAN RIGHTS. ON PAGE FIVE OF OUR ANALYSIS WHEN WE ESTABLISHED THAT FIVE YEARS AGO STRIDES EXISTED IT IS NOT EXPAND THE STATE'S OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE WATER. FOR DOESN'T REQUIRE THE STATE TO FIND THE WATER INFRASTRUCTURE THAT WAS THE RIGHT IF WE GAVE WE DIDN'T GIVE THOSE TWO THINGS. CAN YOU COMMENT ON TAT BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THIS BILL. S.. PUT TOGETHER THIS YEAR DOES ANY OF THAT EITHER. WELL I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT IN AGAIN. MUCH OF WHAT WE DO IN THIS BUILDING IN IN THE AS LEGISLATORS IS INCREMENTAL. IN ASSEMBLYMEMBER INGS BILL ESTABLISH TO HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER IN PART OF THAT LEGISLATION. HAD SOME GUARD RAILS IT DOESN'T PREVENT US PROSPECTIVELY THROUGH FUTURE LEGISLATION OF DETERMINING HOW WE AS A LEGISLATURE TODAY WANT TO MEET THAT HUMAN RIGHT TO WATER. I'VE HEARD LOTS OF NUMBERS BOUNCE AROUND TODAY PEOPLE TALK ABOUT A MILLION FOLKS THAT DON'T ARE NOT HAVING SAFE DRINKING WATER THE ANALYSIS POINTS OUT THAT OF THE THREE HUNDRED THIRTY ONE SMALL DISTRICTS. THAT HAVE HAD SEEN VIOLATIONS IT GOES THROUGH THAT REPRESENT THE RAPTORS REPRESENTS ABOUT A HALF A MILLION PEOPLE. THERE ARE THERE ARE WATER DISTRICTS THAT HAVE. FOR INDIVIDUAL WELLS THAT ARE NOT RATE. HOW DO YOU PROPOSE THAT I CAN SEE HOW THIS CAN ACT HELP THE FOR THOSE THE FEELING SYSTEMS THAT HAVE BEEN FIRED SURE THE VIOLATIONS WE'RE TRYING TO DO A LOT AND CONSOLIDATION BUT HOW DOES THIS? IF WE DON'T HAVE. WE DON'T REGULATORS WATER SYSTEMS HOW WITH THIS BILL HELP THOSE PEOPLE I'M GONNA DEFER TO COUNSEL BUT BEFORE I DO. I'M ALSO INCLUDED ARE SCHOOLS THAT HAVE AN SAFE. DRINKING WATER FOR FOR CHILDREN THE INTO YOUR NORMAL CATEGORIES OF OF WATER DISTRICTS AND THEN WE HAVE SINGLE WELL OWNERS AT CENTRAL BUT ALL DEFERRED TO COUNSEL ARE YOU JUST BECAUSE WE HAVE OTHER MECHANISMS. THAT FORCED THE GATE WE GAVE THE POWER TO STATE WATER RESOURCE BOARD WE'RE FUNDING -- WE CONTINUE THE FUN THEM TO FOR SOME OF THESE FEELING WATER SYSTEMS. YOU FOR MYSTICALLY COME TO JESUS AND SAY YOU WILL CONSOLIDATE WE WILL FORCE YOU TO DO THAT BUT THIS IS A DIFFERENT PROGRAM. WELL DIFFERENT PROGRAM SO YEAH I WANT TO SEE IF WE DON'T HAVE AUTHORITY TO DO THAT. I WAS AT WORK. SO I I I THINK THAT'S A REALLY GOOD QUESTION AND YOU'RE RIGHT -- PRIVATE WELLS ARE IN A DIFFERENT POSITION THAN. I COMMUNITY WATER SYSTEMS. SB EIGHTY EIGHT THAT FORTY THAT YOU REFERRED -- ALLOWS THE STATE TO ORDER CONSOLIDATION OF BAILING WATER SYSTEMS. I'LL LAST YEAR AB TWENTY FIVE A ONE X. TO ORDER EXTENSION OF SERVICE TO PRIVATE WELLS. SO I THINK THAT'S PART OF THE ANSWER THERE ARE COMMUNITIES LIKE TOMBSTONE -- TERRITORY IN FRESNO COUNTY. WHERE THERE'S A LARGE CLUSTER OF PRIVATE WELLS WERE EXTENSION OF SERVICE IS PROBABLY THE BEST ANSWER THEIR? QUITE A BIT OF CONTAMINATION IN THAT COMMUNITY. THE OTHER PART OF THE ANSWER I THINK I THAT SOME OF IT'S GOING TO HAVE TO BE CONTRACTED OUT THROUGH SERVICE PROVIDERS LIKE. ENTERPRISES ARE CA SEE IN ORDER TO DO. TREATMENT ONE OF USE TREATMENT -- TO ADDRESS THOSE ISSUES. AND IF I MIGHT JUST ADD ON TO THAT. THE CONSOLIDATION PIECE THIS BILL DOES NOT. PREVENT IN FACT MAIN DEED PRIORITIZE. SOME CONSOLIDATION. SOMETHING A LITTLE UNDER HALF OF THE THREE HUNDRED WATER DISTRICT IDENTIFIED WE THINK WOULD BE. CANDIDATES FOR CONSIDERING CONSOLIDATION. WITH A SAFE CLEAN DRINKING WATER SOURCE AND THAT COULD BE THE BEST BANG FOR THE BUCK FOR THOSE COMMUNITIES IN DISTRICTS. SO WERE WE DON'T PRECLUDE THE PROSPECT OF CONSOLIDATION. AS PART OF THE OVERALL REMEDY. AND I GUESS THOUGH THE LAST QUESTIONS WE HAVE YOU KNOW NITRATES ONE SOURCE OF POLLUTION WE GOT NATURALLY OCCURRING ARSENIC THAT'S ANOTHER SOURCE. OF POLLUTION YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME COMMUNITIES THAT HOW WOULD I SAY THIS HAVE LOCATED IN THE ABSOLUTE WORST POSSIBLE PLACE THAT THEY COULD BE. THEIR ENTHUSIASTIC THEIR SINCERE I DON'T SEPT SIX HAVE CONTAMINATED WITH THAT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAS THE NOTHING ABOUT THE FIELD SEPTIC. THAT'S CONTAMINATED THE WELL THE PEOPLE WERE GOING TO GET THEIR SOURCE FROM. WHAT MECHANISM DO WE HAVE? TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION WITH THIS BILL TO SAY THIS IS AN AREA YOU CALL IT HOME WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE IN THE FIRES ON THE CALL THAT HOME. THAT FROM A PUBLIC POLICY POINT OF VIEW WE NEED TO HAVE THAT DISCUSSION ABOUT THESE ARE FUNDAMENTALLY UNSAFE PLACES TO LIVE NOT. YET. WELL I I APPRECIATE YOUR RAISING THAT ISSUE AND IF YOU HADN'T DONE AND I WAS GONNA LINK IT TO OUR CURRENT FIRE CHALLENGES OF COMMUNITIES BILL BUILDING OUT INTO FIRE. HI FIRE RISK AREAS -- WE NEED TO DO A BETTER JOB AT THE LOCAL PLANNING. LEVEL AND WHERE APPROPRIATE AT THE STATE LEVEL AND I'M MORE THAN OPEN. TO EXPLORE HOW WE LOOK AT THOSE SOURCES OF CONTAMINATION ANNA AND ADDRESS SOME OF THE LOCAL PLANNING SHORTCOMINGS THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY ANY OTHER FURTHER QUESTIONS SPOTS FROM THE THE IF I COULD I JUST. SENATOR MONNING HAS BEEN A DO YEOMAN'S JOB OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS AND AND IN BEING SO PASSIONATE AND COMPASSIONATE ABOUT THIS ISSUE THAT IT. TO THIS HEART WARMING TO SEE AND WE JUST NEED TO NOW PRODUCE. IN THAT. SO I'M HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL OKAY THE DOES MOVE BY CENTER HELL. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE. JUST BRIEFLY I WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE FOR ITS. IMPORTANT SUPPORT FROM YOUR STAFF IN WORKING WITH US AND THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS I APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS IN SUPPORT. IN. IT'S OVER DO WE NEED TO GET THIS DONE THIS YEAR THANK YOU. THANK YOU THANK YOU SIR. BY SHOWING SUPPORT THIS ENTHUSIASTICALLY APPRECIATIVE ON COMING IN -- TECHNICALLY COLOR. ITEM NUMBER FIVE SB TWO HUNDRED BY SENATOR MONNING. THE MOTION IS DUE PASSED TO THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE. HILL AYE SKINNER. SKINNER AYE STERN [inaudible] STONE. I CAL SCHEME. OKAY SERRANO THAT OPEN. FOR YOU FOR FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO ADD ON TO THAT DOES HAVE ENOUGH VOTES TO GET OUT OF COMMITTEE AND TO APPRECIATE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR THANK YOU MEMBERS NOW IN AN ACTIVE OF ABSOLUTE. COLLEGIALITY. ABSOLUTELY JOHN I WANT TO RAISE OUR COLLEAGUE CENTER LEYVA FOR SACRIFICING HERSELF. AND ALLOWING CENTER DODD WHO IS APPARENTLY A BIG RUSH WHY ARE. TO PRESENT HIS SIDE HIS ESSENTIAL ITEM NUMBER SEVEN AS I SB. TWO THIRTY TWO AND I JUST HOPE THAT THE SENATE DIED -- I MAYBE PROVIDES CENTER LEYVA WITH THAT LOW LEAD BOTTLE OF WINE. AFTER ALL THIS IS. OKAY ALL RIGHT ALL RIGHT GIVEN YOUR YOUR DISTRICT. OKAY THE SENATE OUT YOU MAY PERCEIVE THIS IS I'M SEVEN YOUR PACKETS MEMBERS SB. TWO THIRTY TWO SER DOT YES MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THANK YOU VERY MUCH I AM PRESENTING SB. TWO THIRTY TWO I WOULD LIKE TO BEGIN BY AGREEING TO TAKE THE CLARIFYING AMENDMENTS BEING OFFERED IN THE ANALYSIS. SB TWO THIRTY TWO CONFORMS CALIFORNIA STATE LAW TO THE TOXIC PACKAGING CLEARINGHOUSE T. PC AGE MODEL LAW. WHICH SETS TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER BILLION AS THE MAXIMUM ALLOWABLE AMOUNT OF HEAVY METALS THAT CAN BE USED. IN RECYCLED PACKAGING. CALIFORNIA ADOPTED ITS OWN TOXIC IN PACKAGING PREVENTIONS ACT TPP A IN TWO THOUSAND THREE JUST LIKE NINETEEN OTHER STATES COUNTRY. THE TTP ESTABLISH THE THRESHOLD OF A HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION OF HEAVY METALS AND PACKAGING. WHEN THE TPP A WAS ENACTED GLASS PACKAGING WAS NOT SUBJECT TO THE ACT? GLASSES INERT AND DOES NOT LEAVE ANY. THIS ELEMENT COMPONENTS. HOWEVER NINE YEARS AFTER THE TVPA WAS ENACTED IN. TWO THOUSAND TWELVE THE P. T. S. C. ADMINISTRATIVELY. CHOSE TO APPLY THE ACT TO GLASS CONTAINERS. FOR REASONS NOT WELL UNDERSTOOD EVEN TO THIS DAY. GLASS BOTTLES CONTAIN TRACE AMOUNTS OF LEAD. SINCE CALL IT WHICH IS SOURCE FOR MANY TYPES OF GLASS PRODUCTS THE COME FROM MANY COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD. IS CONSTANTLY RECYCLE. TO ME THE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION STANDARD GLASS MANY FACTORS BAXTER'S. MUST REDUCE THE PERCENTAGE OF RECYCLED CULLEN THE GLASS MANUFACTURING PROCESS. THE LESS COLOR USED IN THE GLASS MANUFACTURING PROCESS. MEANS MORE GLAD VIEWS GLASS WILL STAY IN THE WASTE STREAM AND WE'LL BE LANDFILL. THIS IS CONTRARY TO STATE LAWS REQUIRING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS TO REDUCE SOLID WASTE. BY 75%. ALSO THE LET'S CALL IT USED A GLASS MANUFACTURING PROCESS REQUIRES HIGHER FURNACE TEMPERATURES. THE HOTTER THE FURNACE THE GREATER THE RELEASE OF GREENHOUSE GASES. LET'S CALL IT USED IN THE MANUFACTURING PROCESS CONTRADICTS THE STATE RECYCLE GODDET STANDARD OF 35%. A GLASS PACKAGING. SCIENTIFIC STUDIES DEMONSTRATE THAT THE TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION STANDARD FOR GLASS PACKAGINGIS NOT IN ANY WAY HARMFUL. AND THAT IS WHY THE MODEL CODE SETS THAT IS A MAXIMUM CONTENT STANDARD. CALIFORNIA SHOULD CONFORMANCE STANDARD GLASS PACKAGING TO THE MODEL CODE AT TWO HUNDRED PARTS MILLION WHICH HELPS THE GLASS INDUSTRY MEET SEVERAL OTHER IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL GOALS. I WITHOUT A RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE AND WITH ME TODAY ARE WITNESSES FROM THE GLASS PACKAGING IT'S TOO AS WELL AS OTHERS. WHO ARE HERE TODAY TO EXPRESS UP YOU SO MUCH YES? HI -- MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF THE GLASS PACKAGING IS O THE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL -- I I JUST IT. LAWS THAT YOU YOUR ANALYSIS DOES AN EXCELLENT JOB OF OUTLINING THE THE WHOLE HISTORY OF THE TOXINS IMPACTING ON CALIFORNIA. THE EVOLUTION OF THE MODEL LAW THE EVOLUTION OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS. SIMILAR LAW AND AND AND AND AND REALLY THE THE THE SAFETY OF A OF A GLASS CONTAINERS AYE AYE. LESSER QUESTIONS I WON'T REPEAT ANY OF THAT I AM I I WILL SAY I AM THE BILL DOES CONFORM. TO CONFORM TO THE TO THE MODELED A TAXIS IMPACTION CLEARING HOUSE LAW IT'S CONSISTENT WITH THE YEAR WITH THAT WITH LAWS IN EUROPE AND AND AS A RESULT THAT WILL ENSURE. THAT -- WE THAT THE GLASS MANUFACTURER'S AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING YOU KNOW CALIFORNIA IN THE REST OF THE UNITED STATES ARE ARE USING AS MUCHCLASSES AS RECYCLE GLASS AS THEY POSSIBLY CAN WHICH FOR FOR THE INTERESTS OF THIS COMMITTEE -- IT HAS A SUBSTANTIVE IMPACT ON THREE SIX TONS OF OF RECYCLED GLASS -- USED IN A IN A FURNACE THERE'S A ONE TIME REDUCTION OF CARBON AND A AND I AND WE THINK THAT'S VERY IMPORTANT AND AND AND USEFUL FOR THIS PURPOSE. YEAH THANK YOU THANK YOU. OKAY OF FOLKS YOU WANT TO ADD ON SUPPORT. HERE MEMBER JURY HOW WE'VE ON BEHALF OF ALL IN THE IN THE WAY THE LARGEST LAUGH CONTAINER IN THE FACTOR IN THE WORLD. WE WILL ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL. LAST PACKAGING IS IMPORTANT OPTION -- FOR FOR MANUFACTURED -- FOR PROFIT FOR FOR THE WINE INDUSTRY BUT THAT CONTINUE. AT RISK BECAUSE OF A NUMBER OF REASONS -- ONE THAT THERE'S A QUESTION MARK ATTACHED. TO THE FIFTY OF GLASS BOTTLES IN THE A NONE OF THE VERY QUESTION MARK. THIS BILL RIVER -- ESTABLISHES THAT THE GUY PACKAGE WILL STILL BE A VIABLE THANK YOU. TERRELL COOK FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU OKAY HE WANTS TO RAISE CONCERNS ABOUT THE BILL OPPOSITION -- YES MARK. I HAVE A MERCURY WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE AND I I DO WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS -- I THINK I'VE. HAVE SOME LEVEL OF TRACK RECORD AS BEING VERY SUPPORTIVE OF GLASS RECYCLING IN THE USE RECYCLED CONTENT. ARM AND I WAS ON THE SIDE OF THE TABLE IN SUPPORTING A POLICY THAT WOULD RECOGNIZE THAT -- IF THERE WAS TOO MUCH OF A LIMIT ON LEAD -- IT COULD POTENTIALLY IMPACT CLASS RECYCLING RIGHT BUT THE EXPERIENCE THAT WE'VE SEEN IN CALIFORNIA OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS IS THAT THE INVESTMENTS THAT CALIFORNIA RECYCLERS. IN CALIFORNIA GLASS MANUFACTURERS HAVE SUCCEEDED ENSURING THAT NONE OF THE COLLEGE THAT IS GOING INTO MAKING. CALIFORNIA MADE GLASS BOTTLES IS EXCEEDING THE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION STE. SO THERE IS NO CHANCE THAT THIS WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT GLASS RECYCLING. THE WHAT THIS POTENTIALLY WHAT DO IS CREATE A IN ROAD FOR GLASS BOTTLES THAT DON'T MEET THE STANDARD. BEING IMPORTED INTO CALIFORNIA BUILDING CALIFORNIA AND THEN SOLD. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY HERE TO IT. TO MAINTAIN THIS WE'VE WE'VE DONE A GREAT JOB IN CALIFORNIA OF REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF LEAD IN RECYCLE GLASS. WE SHOULDN'T UNDERMINE THAT INVESTMENT. I THINK THAT THERE IS A AND WE SHOULD SUPPORT CALIFORNIA GLASS MANUFACTURING IN CALIFORNIA GLASS RECYCLING. I WANT TO ECHO THE POINTS THAT SOME OF THE SUPPORT OF SAID I DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S ANY DANGER TO THE CONSUMER. OF TWO HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION OF LEAD IN A GLASS BOTTLE. NOT GOING TO BE IMPACTED THAT BUT GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE'RE NOT RECYCLING A 100% OF THE CLASS GIVEN THE FACT THAT CLASS WORKERS ARE INVOLVED. IN DEALING WITH CRUSHED GLASS BUT HAVING LED IN GLASS OVER ONE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION COULD HAVE A PUBLIC HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT. I THINK THERE'S AN OPPORTUNITY TO TO COME UP WITH A FIX HERE. TO ENSURE THAT GLASS BOTTLES EMPTY GLASS BOTTLES THAT ARE IMPORTED INTO THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA HAVE TO MEET THE SAME ONE HUNDRED PARTS PER MILLION STANDARD. CALIFORNIA GLASS RECYCLERS AND MANUFACTURERS ARE CURRENTLY MEETING. THAT'S MY OBJECTIVE I HAVE EVERY CONFIDENCE THAT. OVER THE COURSE OF THIS BILL MOVING FORWARD THAT ALL OF A CHANCE TO DISCUSS THIS WITH THE SPONSORS AND THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND THIS IS SOMETHING THAT. YOU NEED TO BE ADDRESSED BEFORE I'LL BE TALKED OUT OF IT SENATE CASKEY. I GUESS STATE [inaudible] I ONE AS BEGIN WERE MR MURRAY. AND IT IS THAT IT APPEARS TO ME THAT COLOR THAT'S YOU TRAVéS CREATED WITH THEM -- FORM PRODUCE GET GLASS ADDS TO THE LEVEL OF LEAD. IN THE RECYCLING OF OF CLASS PRODUCT I GUESS MY CONCERN IS THE THE WINE AND SPIRITS INDUSTRY. BECAUSE IF YOU IT'S MY UNDERSTANDING THAT CHILEAN WINE WHICH IS VERY POPULAR ABOUT CONSUMING PUBLIC HERE THE GLASS IS PRODUCED THERE WHICH DOESN'T MEET CALIFORNIA STANDARDS AS A HIGHER LEVEL OF OF LETTING IT. I'M JUST WONDERING IS IF THIS IS THE TIME WE WOULDN'T WANT TO BRING IN THE CLASS IN THE SPIRITS INDUSTRY TO HELP OUT MEET THESE LAUDABLE RECYCLING GOALS THAT THE THAT THE THE BILL. HOPES TO A CHEAP. I THINK WHICH WHAT YOU'RE WHAT YOU'RE ASKING IS THIS IS THIS THE TIME TO EXPAND THIS BILL -- TO YOUR WORK ON CONTENT LEAD CONTENT COMING. IN FROM OTHER OTHER COUNTRIES THAT SUPPLY. YEAH WINE OR SPIRITS OR ANY OTHER. PRODUCTS IN A INCLUDING LAST FALL I THINK THAT IS. ONE WAY OVER EXPANSIVE WHERE WE WANT TO BE ON THIS BILL THIS YEAR BUT I THINK IT DOES HE OWE IT MAY RAISE AN ISSUE OF A FUTURE BILL. I IT YOU KNOW IN THE LEGISLATURE I WAS ACTUALLY IN THE GLASS PACKAGING. YOUR BUSINESS A ONE TOP WE APPOINT TIME AND LET ME TELL YOU IT'S NOT JUST TELLING. BUT THE BUT THE REALITY IS IS WHILE THE U. S. GLASS MEETS THE STANDARD. YOU KNOW IN THE MARKET PLACE. BE ABLE TO GO IN AND SCREAMED OUT. CALLER ID ON THE BASIS OF YOU KNOW I DON'T KNOW. WHAT WHATEVER THE MARKET SHARE OF CHILEAN WINES CHINA GOLD GLASS I THINK IS? YUP PROBABLY AMONG AMONG THE WORST DEPENDING UPON WHAT THE MANUFACTURERS. A FAR SO WHAT. I'M SORRY. MICROBES I I WASN'T SURE IF I UNDERSTOOD THE QUESTION SO I I I WELL THE THE GOAL HERE IS THAT IF WE IF WE IF WE ADOPT THIS BILL AND WE RAISE THE LEVEL FROM. ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED WE WILL BE ABLE TO USE MORE RECYCLED PRODUCTS. RIGHT WE DON'T HAVE THE VIEWS OF PURGING GLASS THE COMING TO TO TO MAKE OUR CALIFORNIA BOTTLES. RIGHT CALIFORNIA POLICY. OKAY SO THAT'S THAT'S THE GOAL HERE ONE OF IN THE INDUSTRY IS THAT THE AUTHOR HAS SUGGESTS IS THAT. SOME OF THE GLASS THAT SOLD HERE IN THE WINE AND SPIRIT INDUSTRY. WHICH IS NOT PART OF THE RECYCLING PROGRAM EXCEEDS THE ONE HUNDRED LEVEL IN IS ONE OF THE REASONS THAT. WE'RE NOT MAKING THESE TARGETS BECAUSE I'VE HEARD FROM YOU AND FROM OTHER OUT OTER. PEOPLE THAT DO PRODUCE COLLEGE IS THEY DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO GET THE LEAD OUT OF THE OUT OF IT BECAUSE THE GLOBS OF THE MACHINE SO THE ONLY WAY THAT WE CAN GET. OF ALL THE CALIFORNIA BALLS ARE AT A HUNDRED THE ONLY WAY THEY CAN GET ABOVE ONE HUNDRED IS FOR IN CLASS THAT'S IN THE FORM OF WINE AND SPIRITS BOTTLES. THAT EXCEED THAT LEVEL THAT'S SORT AYE SOON THAT'S THE REASON THAT YOU THAT YOU WANT THIS BILL. MY QUESTION IS WHY DON'T YOU JUST BRING ALL THE WIND. THE WIND INDUSTRY IN THE SPIRIT INDUSTRY INTO THE RECYCLING STE. THE RECYCLING. TO HELP SOLVE THAT PROBLEM OKAY I WOULD BE A WONDERFUL OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO DO IT. NOW I UNDERSTAND YOUR QUESTION -- THAT'S A THAT'S A THAT'S A GOOD A GOOD QUESTION FOR THE WINE AND SPIRITS INDUSTRY WORKING CLASS BOTTOM MANUFACTURES AND AND I DON'T HAVE I DON'T I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE WINE AND SPIRITS INDUSTRY WOULD. WOULD THINK OF THAT IDEA IF THAT IF THAT'S ACTUALLY NOW NOW THAT I UNDERSTAND THE QUESTION -- SENATOR DOT. SAYS I'M [inaudible] OKAY [inaudible] I'M. ABSOLUTELY THE FACT THAT -- GLASS AND ALUMINUM. ARE TWO OF THE MATERIALS. THAT WE ARE STILL GETTING OF BENEFIT. FROM IN TERMS OF STRAIGHT CARBON REDUCTION [inaudible] AND OVERALL. REDUCTION IN ENERGY USE BY. COLLECTING THEM IN REMANUFACTURING. AND UNFORTUNATELY SOME OF THE OTHER MATERIALS THAT WE COLLECT AND EITHER DON'T GET RE MANUFACTURED OR MAYBE SOME DAYS YOU WE'RE NOT GETTING THAT SAME BENEFIT SO FOR THAT REASON WE WANT TO DO EVERYTHING WE CAN. TO DEFINITELY ANSWER THAT WE ARE MAXIMIZING CLASS RECYCLING AND WE WANT TO ENCOURAGE MORE USE OF GLASS PRODUCT [inaudible] AND I ANYWAY SO BUT I DO I DO -- GLASSES INERT I DON'T HAVE THE FEAR THAT I WILL GET THE LEAD. WHEN I DRINK IT? I'M SOMETHING OUT OF THAT GLASS BOTTLE. BUT WHAT IS THE EXPOSURE TO OUR FOLKS. THEY ARE USING A HIGHER LEAD CONTENT WHAT DO WE KNOW YET. WHAT THE WHAT THE POSSIBLE EXPOSURE IS THEN TO THE WORKER WITH THAT HIGHER LET? NO BUT I DO KNOW THAT THERE'S AM. I KNOW THAT THERE THAT YOU DON'T THE DIVISION OF OCCUPATIONAL SAFETY AND HEALTH AND TOXINS AND ALL. THAT THAT'S I MEAN THERE IT'S THAT'S IN THERE BAILIWICK AND I I WOULD ASSUME -- I I'M I'M I WILL JUST THE GLASS. IS A LOT OF ACTORS ARE ARE ARE SAFE WERE IT'S A SAFE WORKING ENVIRONMENT AND GLASS WORKERS DO SUPPORT BILL SO I DON'T KNOW YEAH AND THAT I KNOW TOO BUT I JUST IT'S I JUST THINK IT IS A LEGITIMATE. POINT THAT WE COULD BE BY RAISING IT EXPOSING OUR OWN WORKERS TO MORE LET AND WE MIGHT WANT TO AND THEN -- SURE YOU COULD GET IT OUGHT. TO THAT'S WHAT I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT AND I GUESS I'M GOING TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY AND ALL EVEN MOVE IT BUT WHAT I'M. HOPING. IS THAT WE CAN'T DESIGN AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD IS THERE A WAY TO DESIGN SOME SORT OF INCENTIVE [inaudible] TO OR SOME SORT OF WAITING GET. GLASS THAT COMING INTO THE COUNTRY THAT IS. HI LED TO GET OUT A LOWER LET. SO THAT WE SO BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT. TO MESS UP OUR RECYCLING PROGRAM OR LIMIT OUR USE REUSE A GLASS. BUT I ALSO WANT TO GET THAT LED OUT SO I KNOW THERE'S ARE TWO SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT GOALS. BUT I THINK I CAN I CAN DO A BETTER JOB OF ANSWERING THIS QUESTION NOW THAT I THOUGHT IF THIS THROUGH A LITTLE BIT. FOR FOR ONE I UNDERSTAND THAT IT'S IT'S IT'S IT'S NOT LIKE THERE'S ON IN THE COLOR THE BROKEN THE THE NETWORKING OF GLASS. EAT ANY ANY METAL IN HEAVY METAL IN THE IN THE IN THE GLASS IT'S IN THE MATRIX OF THE GLASS IT'S IT'S IT'S A LOT ABOUT IT WE MELTED REMAKE CORRECT CORRECT IN IN AND THAT'S GEORGE IN THE FURNACE AND AND IT'S YOU KNOW MOLD LIQUID. AND AND STILL IN THE FURNACE AND IT'S AND IT'S SO IT'S NOT THEM. IT'S NOT THERE THERE THERE'S NO THERE'S NOT WORKERS SO TRY IT. FOR THAT AND THEN I AM I AM. AND AND THAT AND WE'RE NOT SAYING THAT THERE'S A LOT OF NOT SAYING THAT EVERYTHING COMING FROM IT FROM ANOTHER STATE OR FROM ANOTHER COUNTRY IS. HIGHER BUT IS ON IN E. SO IN WHAT WHAT WE'RE DOING IS MOVING FROM ONE HUNDRED TO TWO HUNDRED JUST TO PROVIDE SOME FLEXIBILITY TO ENSURE THAT THE GLASS PRODUCT. IS IS IS CAN CAN BE MADE CONSISTENTLY IN AN HOUR EVERYWHERE UNDERSTAND WELL I THINK I WILL MOVE THE BILL. BUT I WOULD LIKE. FOR THE AUTHOR. TO TALKTO I'M. HOW FOR INSTANCE VOICE OR SOME OTHER ENTITY? ABOUT HOW WE MIGHT. INCENTIVIZE OR OTHERWISE. GET IT TRYING TO REDUCE THE LEAD CONTENT. OF THAT OTHER GLASS. SO THAT ULTIMATELY WELL THIS SPEAKS IS NEEDED NOW WE MIGHT NOT NEED THE SPECS IN THE FUTURE. BECAUSE OF THE UNINTENDED CONSEQUENCE OF POTENTIALLY EXPOSING PEOPLE LEAD WHICH WE KNOW IS. SO WITH THAT I MVE THE BILL WITH THE AMENDMENT. THAT THE AUTHOR. SAID THEY WERE. YEAH I MEAN ESSENTIALLY AYE IT DOESN'T HAVE TO INCORPORATE IT NECESSARILY IN THIS BILL BUT WHAT WE HAVE TO DO BASICALLY MY COMMITMENT IS. THAT IF THERE IF THERE'S A WAY TO INCORPORATE IN THIS BILL. OR FUTURE LEGISLATION AND AND JUST TRY TO FIND OUT. WHAT THE BEST WAY GOING FORWARD IS TO TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF LEAD? THE COMES INTO OUR RECYCLING SYSTEM. I APPRECIATE THAT CENTER. THIS WILL ONLY AFFECT PROSPECT IS HAS BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE AUTHOR YES. OKAY RIGHT THAT YEAH SO I MOVING THE BILL AS AMENDED [inaudible] RIGHT. DO WE TAKE THAT AS YOUR CLOTHES YES CENTER. YES WITH THANKS TO CENTER LEYVA THANK YOU -- DISORDERLY ONCE AGAIN THANK YOU TO MARK AS WELL AND AND AND AND AND THE AUTHOR AND ALL THE ADVOCATES FOR IT. SO THIS MOVE BY CENTER SKINNER SECTOR WAS COLOR. A ITEM NUMBER SEVEN SP TWO THIRTY TWO BY SENATOR DODD. THE ACTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED. ALLEN AYE ALLEN AYE [inaudible] HILL [inaudible] I SKINNER. SKINNER AYE STERN [inaudible] I STONE. I CAL SKI. OKAY SAYS FIVE VOTES WILL HOLD EVEN FOR THE FOLKS MUCH OF AN EFFORT TO GET OUT. AND THAT. DO YOU APPRECIATE YOUR EXTRA VERY PATIENT CENTER LEYVA. YOU PROBABLY LEARNED A LOT TODAY. BUT A LOT OF ISSUES -- WE'RE YOU'RE HERE TO PRESENT.

AIR CONTAMINANT. CLOSER TO HARMFUL AIR CONTAMINANTS PM TWO POINT FIVE AND OZONE IS DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASED HOSPITALIZATIONS FOR CHRONIC HEART AND LUNG DISEASES. AND OHER SERIOUS HEALTH IMPACTS FOR ELDERLY ADULTS AND YOUNG CHILDREN. THE CALIFORNIA AIR RESOURCES BOARD CARB CURRENTLY ADMINISTERS TO INSPECTION PROGRAMS FOR HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS HOWEVER THESE PROGRAMS ONLY REQUIRE THE CONTROL OF EXCESSIVE SMOKE. AND LACK MEASURES TO LIMIT HARMFUL EMISSIONS. SB TWO TEN WOULD DIRECT CARP TO WORKING COORDINATION WITH MULTIPLE STATE AGENCIES TO EPIC IN EMPLOYMENT A HEAVY DUTY INSPECTION AND MAINTENANCE PROGRAM FOR TRUCKS. FOURTEEN THOUSAND PLUS POUNDS. SB TWO TEN WOULD ALSO ESTABLISH TEST PROCEDURES FOR DIFFERENT MODEL TRUCKS AND MISSION CONTROL TECHNOLOGIES TO MEASURE THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE EMISSIONS CONTROL OF KNOX. AND PM TWO POINT FIVE SB TWO TEN ALSO APPLIES TO OUT OF STATE TRUCKS AND WILL HELP LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR LAW ABIDING TRUCK OWNERS AND OPERATORS. OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO SB TWO TEN WILL ASSIST IN THE REMOVAL OF SIXTEEN HUNDRED TONS. OF HARMFUL PARTICULATE MATTER A QUICK TAKING. FIVE THOUSAND TRUCKS OFF THE ROAD. NOT ONLY WILL SB TWO TEN HELP IMPROVE PUBLIC HEALTH AND AIR QUALITY IT WILL IMPROVE THE LIFE EXPECTANCY OF HEAVY DUTY TRUCKS. SB TWO TEN APPLY SIMILAR RESPONSIBILITIES TO TRUCK UP. TO MAINTAIN THEIR MISSION CONTROLS AS WITH WHAT WE ALREADY REQUIRE CARS THAT WE DRIVE DAILY. I WANT TO THANK THE VERY STAKEHOLDERS THEY'VE BEEN WORKING WITH US FOR THE LAST TWO YEARS. INCLUDING THE CALIFORNIA TRUCKING ASSOCIATION AND FARM BUREAU FOR CONTINUING TO WORK ON THIS ISSUE WITH MYSELF AND MY OFFICE. WITH ME TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT BECAUSE ALLEN ALPS WITH THE BAY AREA QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND JOHN BHOSLE. THOSE ELKS USE ME JOHN WITH CAL START AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE THANK YOU SENATOR. GOOD AFTERNOON CHAIR AROUND IN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE MY NAME IS ALAN AB SOME OF THE BAY AREA AIR QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND I'D LIKE TO START BY THANKING. THE EQ STAFF -- FOR AN EXCELLENT RIGHT OF NOTING THE HEALTH EFFECTS OF AIR POLLUTION FROM HEAVY DUTY AND MEDIUM HEAVY DUTY -- DIESEL TRUCKS OF BOTH THE CRITERIA POLLUTANTS AND THE TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS. AND IN NO ALSO ECHO US SENATE THE APPROXIMATELY ONE MILLION OF THESE TRUCKS THERE ON THE ROAD IN CALIFORNIA. AND DRIVING -- WELL OVER SIXTY MILLION MILES PER DAY IN CALIFORNIA -- WHEN WE WHEN YOU LOOK AT THE AT THE DIESEL EMISSIONS THAT -- THAT WE ESTIMATE COME FROM THESE VEHICLES. WE WE MEASURE THAT IN TERMS OF MANY TONS PER DAY OF TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS SPECIFICALLY I'D -- DIESEL PARTICULATE MATTER WHICH IS ONE OF THE THINGS THAT WE'RE TRYING -- TO RATED CALIFORNIA THROUGH MANY PER [inaudible] AND IN THE BAY AREA -- DIESEL FREE BY THIRTY THREE INITIATIVE. WHEN YOU LOOK AT AT -- AIR MISSIONS IN CALIFORNIA. IS I MENTION TRANSPORTATION IS THE ONE THING THAT WE'RE TRYING TO CONCENTRATE ON DIESEL SPECIFICALLY -- MANY PROGRAMS RUN AT THIS AT GOAL LEVEL INCLUDING -- RECENTLY -- OF THE STATE'S -- COMMUNITY AIR PROTECTION PROGRAM WE'VE TARGETED MANY COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA AND AND AS WE FIND -- TO IN ALMOST ALL OF THOSE COMMUNITIES DIESEL TRUCK TRANSPORTATION IS THE NUMBER. ONE IS THE NUMBER ONE PROBLEM IN THOSE COMMUNITIES. IN IN SPECIFICALLY IN THE BAY AREA FOR THE WEST OAKLAND COMMUNITY -- DIESEL TRUCK TRAFFIC. IS THE END ADDITIONAL OF 33% OF THE EXCESS CANCER RISK FOR MANY OF THE RESIDENTS LIVING -- IN WEST OAKLAND AND SO I TO THE CAN NOW THAT WE CAN HAVE A SMOG CHECK PROGRAM THAT MIRRORS WHAT PEOPLE DO WITH THAT WITH THEIR CARS. ON AN ANNUAL BASIS -- THE BAY AREA'S IN SUPPORT OF THAT AND WE THINK THERE CAN BE TREMENDOUS EMISSION REDUCTIONS OF BY REQUIRING -- PROPER MAINTENANCE AND AND THIS MARCH OF TRUCKS THANK YOU THANK YOU. SO MUCH SIR. MISTER CHAIRMAN JOHN THOSE EL PRESIDENCY OF CAL START WE'RE A NATIONAL NONPROFIT ORGANIZATION WITH TWO HUNDRED MEMBER COMPANIES. WE STARTED OUT THE WITH A MISSION OF SHOWING THAT WE CAN CLEAN UP THE AIR AND REDUCE HARMFUL EMISSIONS. ALL CREATING AN INDUSTRY TWENTY SEVEN YEARS LATER WE NOW HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND ARE MEMBERS HAVE THIRTY THOUSAND DIRECT JOBS HERE IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA. MANY OF OUR MEMBERS ARE BUILDING AND MANUFACTURING PROVIDING GOOD BLUE COLLAR JOBS THE BUILDINGS DURING MISSION YEARS OUR MISSION TRUCKS AND BUSES IN OFF ROAD EQUIPMENT. TO VERY INSPIRING STORY WE ALSO HAVE SEVERAL MEMBERS THAT HAVE LARGE FLEETS AND BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL IS FEASIBLE. AND AND THEY CAN COMPLY WITH IT THAT ON THEIR TRUCK SHOULD BE AS CLEAN AS AS ALL THAT ALL THE TRUCKS ARE IN IN IS AS REQUIRED BY CARP. WE NEED TO CLEAN UP THE HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE SECTOR THIS BILL TAKES A VERY FLEXIBLE REGULATORY APPROACH WORKING WITH THE AGENCY WERE THE AGENCY COULD WORK WITH THE FLEETS TO FIGURE OUT THE MOST EFFICIENT COST EFFECTIVE WAY TO COMPLY WITH IT. WE ARE CHEN AYE VOTE. THANK YOU SO MUCH OTHER FOLKS WANT TO VOICE THEIR SUPPORT. MEMBERS ARE MOUNTAINS SMITH WITH THE AMERICAN CANCER SOCIETY CANCER ACTION NETWORK AND SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. MR CARE MEMBERS ROCKY RESCUE WITH COALITION FOR CLEAN AIR I ALSO REPRESENTING ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA TODAY LIKE TO THANK THE AUTHOR FOR THIS VERY IMPORTANT BILL -- IF I'M NOT MISTAKEN TODAY'S THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING. I CAN'T THINK OF A BETTER DAY TO MOVE THIS VERY IMPORTANT PIECE OF LEGISLATION THAT WOULD GO A LONG WAY AND AT CLEAN OUR AIR LET'S TAKE THE KNOCKS AT EQUAL KNOCKS.

LISTING SHE MAKER WITH FOSTER FOR CALIFORNIANS SUPPORT ALSO EXPRESSING SUPPORT FOR THREE FIFTY BAY AREA ACTION WE WANT TO THANK YOU SENATOR LEYVA. BORN COMMON BE HAVE A SIERRA CLUB CALIFORNIA STRONG SUPPORT. JIM WINBERG ON BEHALF OF THE FRIENDS COMMITTEE ON LEGISLATION CALIFORNIA WHERE IN SUPPORT. IN A GALLAGHER FROM THREE FIFTY SACRAMENTO IN SUPPORT. ENTER BY. ANYONE I ONCE OF BOYS OPPOSITION OR RAISE CONCERNS. GOOD AFTERNOON NO OKAY MERGE THE CALIFORNIA FARM BUREAU FEDERATION FIRST I WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS BILL WE UNDERSTAND. THE GOALS AND WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO THE GOALS SIR AND ABOUT HOW WE GET THERE AND SO THE DEVIL'S ALWAYS IN THE DETAILS. I'M ONE OF THE CONCERNS THAT WE HAVE IS. SIMPLY THAT. PROCESS OF TESTING THE VEHICLE SO I HAVE A MEMBER WHO I WAS TALKING TO ABOUT THIS BILL AND SISKIYOU COUNTY AND HE TOLD ME THAT THERE ARE. NO. FACILITIES THAT CAN FIT A HEAVY DUTY VEHICLE TO DO THE TESTING OR THE REPAIR SO THAT. WOULD BE A PROBLEM I'M HIS TRUCK IS. LOW YOU STRUCK UNDER THE D. AT THAT AIR BUTTE TRUCK AND BUS ROLE SO HE'S DRIVING UNDER THOUSAND MILES IF YOU HAD TO DRIVE IT DOWN TO READING. HE WOULD USE 25% OF HIS ANNUAL MILES TO COMPLY WITH THIS PROGRAM SO WE NEED TO WORK THAT OUT. AND THE OTHER ISSUE IS THE TIMING OF REPAIR IF YOU HAVE THE MALFUNCTION INDICATOR LIGHT ILLUMINATED AT THE BEGINNING OF HARVEST SEASON ARE SHIPPING SEASON. YOU CAN'T AFFORD TO PULL THAT TRUCK OUT OF USE -- SO WE NEED TIME TO MAKE SURE THAT WE CAN GET THE REPAIRS DONE AFTER THE BULK OF THE USE AND IS DONE THE OTHER PIECE IS MAKING SURE THAT THAT. IF YOU ARE PULLED OVER AND FOUND THAT YOU HAVE THIS LIGHT THAT YOU DON'T HAVE TO PARK THE TRUCK WE DON'T WANT TO SEE A SITUATION WHERE THERE'S A TRUCK PULLING A LOAD OF CATTLE. AND THE MAIL IS ON AND SO THEN THEY'RE STUCK ON THE SIDE OF THE ROAD NOT TO LEAVE THE HOUSE WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT IT TO FIX IT TAKE IT. FINALLY. DEAL WITH TRUCKS COMING IN TO THE STATE. AIR RESOURCES BOARD HAS TALKED ABOUT HAVING. THEM PLUG INTO A KIOSK WHEN THEY COME ACROSS THE BORDER TO TEST THEIR EMISSIONS. WE HAVE TO HAVE A WAY THAT TRUCKS COULD BE CERTIFIED. OUTSIDE OF CALIFORNIA SO THEY'RE NOT STOPPED AT THE BORDER SO OUR ALMOND PRODUCERS WHO DEPEND ON BEES COMING IN FROM OUT OF STATE TO POLLINATE THEIR ALMONDS. DON'T HAVE THEIR TRUCKS TURNED LIVESTOCK COMING IN ISN'T STOPPED AT THE BORDER SO WE NEED TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT IS IN PLACE. TO MAKE SURE WE'RE NOT STOPPING THE FLOW OF COMMERCE. I'M OBVIOUSLY THIS NEW PROGRAM IS GOING TO ADD COST TO OUR MEMBERS AND SO WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT ADDITIONAL FEES ON TOP OF JUST THE COST OF TESTING AND REPAIRS. BUT WE LOOK FORWARD TO CONTINUING TO WORK WITH THE AUTHORON THIS TIME TO ADDRESS THOSE CONCERNS THANK YOU. I SAW A POINT OF BILL HAS BEEN DOUBLE REFERRED TO TRANSPORTATION COMMITTEE AND THE BULK OF YOUR CA. ARE TERM IN THEIR PURVIEW BUT BUT NOW I'M NOT I I UNDERSTAND YOU WORKING TOGETHER AND JUST TO SAY THAT WE ARE WORKING ON ALL OF THOSE ISSUES. THANK YOU THANK YOU THANKS VERY MUCH APPRECIATE. ANY OTHER FOLKS WHO WANT TO RAISE CONCERNS OR ISSUES SO SOME OF THE BILL. HI LEE SR THORN CALVARY CHAMBER OF COMMERCE I WENT ONLINE OURSELVES WITH THE AND COLLEAGUES FROM THE FARM BUREAU AND ALSO POINT OUT THAT WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONCERNS WITH COSTS. PRIMARILY ON THE UNLIMITED VS FORTY THAT WOULD ALLOW CAR TO CHARGE WHATEVER IT NEEDS TO SUPPORT THIS PROGRAM BEFORE COMING BACK TO THE LEGISLATURE SO. WE DO APPRECIATE THE PRODUCTIVE CONVERSATIONS THAT WE PUBLIC YOUR STAFF UP TO CONTINUE TO DO THAT. THANK YOU. I'M JACOB CHEMICAL INDUSTRY COUNCIL OF CALIFORNIA -- CONCERNS AS DISTURBED BY NICKEL THANK YOU. YUP I TRUCKING ASSOCIATION RUN THANK THE SENATOR AND HER STAFF FOR ALL THE WORK THEY'VE OPTED INTO THIS WITH US -- WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE BILL RIGHT NOW -- WE DO HAVE SOME CONCERNS WITH THE FEELING WHICH INCLUDED IN THE BILL. WE DON'T BELIEVE CARD SHOULD BE GIVEN ON THAT IS PURE THORNHILL THEY CAN JUSTIFY THE COST OF THE PROGRAM. SO WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING ON THAT AND WILL. LOOK AT REEVALUATE OUR POSITION WE COME TO SOME SENATE TRANCE THANK YOU. GOOD AFTERNOON I'M MICROBES IN HERE ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL UTILITIES ASSOCIATION WHICH IS KNOW YOUR YOUR LOCALLY -- LOCAL PUBLICLY OWNED YOU TO AND BY YOU KNOW YOUR YOUR YOUR COLLEAGUES ELECTED OFFICIALS IN YOUR COMMUNITIES. AND WE'RE JUST SEEKING AN AMENDMENT TO THE BILL -- THE THE THE PUBLICLY OWNED UTILITY FLEETS ARE ALREADY REGULATED AT THE CAT THE CALIFORNIA RESOURCES TOWARD UNDER THAT. PLEASE REGULATION FOR PUBLIC AGENCIES AND UTILITIES AND ALSO REGULATED BY THE PERIODIC SMOKING SECTION INSPECTION PROGRAM IN SO REALLY WE WE WE JUST LIKE TO SEE SEEN IN THEM IN THE BILL TO SAY THAT IF YOU'RE ALREADY REGULATED BY THOSE PROGRAMS AS A PUBLIC UTILITY -- AND THEN -- DON'T HAVE TO BE REGULATED BY THIS NEW REGULATION AND AND YOU KNOW AGAIN. UTILITIES UNDERSTAND THE SCOPE OF THE PROBLEM OR NOT AVERSE TO FIX THE PROBLEM THINK THEY'RE ALREADY PART OF THE SOLUTION BY THE REGULATIONS ARE ALREADY SUBJECT. TO THANK YOU. THANK YOU OKAY SO THE ITEM IS BEFORE THE BOARD DO I WILL SAY I I DON'T KNOW THAT THE WAY THAT THE ROLE OF CARBS. MENTION BY SOME THE APPLIANCES ENTIRELY ACCURATE BECAUSE IF THERE IS A HI. YEAH THERE IS ABSOLUTELY A MECHANISM FOR THERE TO BE A DISPUTE AND AND AND AND AN APPEALS PROCESS AND THE CAMPUS COMMUNITY WHATEVER THEY WANT THE SPACE BUT SENATE HEALTH. THANK YOU YOU'RE IN IN THANK YOU THE SENATOR LEYVA FOR FOR THIS LEGISLATION BECAUSE IT. IS THE COMMENTS MADE ABOUT THE WEST OAKLAND AND WHEN I WAS ON THE AIR. AND QUALITY MANAGEMENT DISTRICT AND ON CAR WITH THE SAME TIME WE CONDUCTED A JOINT STUDY. THAT ANALYZED THE AIR OF THE BAY AREA AND ASIAN BECAUSE OF THE DIESEL TRUCK GOING INTO THE PORT BECAUSE OF THE WIND SHIFTS OF IT. IT'S KIND OF THE ARVON OF THE BAT VALLEY IN TERMS OF THE THE MOST POLLUTION GOES THERE AND THE THE MOST DIESEL POLLUTION GOES THERE SO I THINK IN. WE WE NEED TO DO SOMETHING AND THIS IS REALLY I THINK ONE OF THE FIRST OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES WE HAVE. TO TO REALLY SOLVE THAT PROBLEM AND AND I THINK IT'S IT'S A GREAT EFFORT I I DO APPRECIATE THE COMMENTS OF THE FARM BUREAU AND I KNOW YOU'RE GOING TO WORK WITH THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE SEEM. VERY LOGICAL CONCERNS THAT -- AND COMMON SENSE WHEN GINNY TUITION SO BE HAPPY TO MOVE THE BILL. TO THEN SPEND MOVED I HAVE OTHER QUESTIONS BUT YES. CARE MURDER A FOLLOW UP QUESTION FOR MR ABSENT I DON'T EXPECT THAT YOU'LL HAVE AN ANSWER MAYBE ABOVE YOUR PAY GRADE -- BUT ONE OF THE THINGS ON THE ON ON THE FUNDING SIDE WE HAVE TO INVEST GREENHOUSE GASES WE HAVE TO HAVE AN INVESTMENT OF 35% TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES SOME WONDERING IN THIS PARTICULAR STATE WHAT WE'RE GOING. TO IMPROVE DIESEL TRUCKS ALL OVER THE STATE AND PARTICULARLY IN WEST OAKLAND SOME OF THESE INLAND EMPIRE IS WHERE THEY HAVE -- FACILITIES BUT THE TRUCK OWNER OR THE POINT OF REGISTRATION OF THE TRUCK MAY BE. IN SAN FRANCISCO JUST JUST SAYING SO I DON'T KNOW IF THERE'S AN ANSWER YEP BUT I'M CONCERNED AS WE GET DOWN THE GO GET DOWN THE LINE. AND PEOPLE SAY WELL THIS IS THIS MONEY NEEDS TO BE SPENT IN THIS AREA BUT THE BAY AREA THAT'S BEING BENEFIT IT IS THE PRECISE. NOT ATTAINMENT AREAS YEAH I DID THAT. A YES SENATOR WHITE HOUSE YELLED I'LL DO MY BEST TO ANSWER IT. SO SO YOU'RE CORRECT THAT -- THE THERE IS A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF OF THE FUNDING THAT THAT -- IT GOES -- TO DECIDE AND AND I KNOW WHEN WE WHEN WE LOOK AT MOBILE SOURCE INCENTIVE PROGRAMS IN THE BAY AREA. WE WE ACTUALLY DID A STUDY RECENTLY TO FIND OUT -- YOU KNOW GEOGRAPHICALLY WHERE A LOT OF THAT MONEY WENT IN AND IN GENERALLY WHEN YOU LOOK AT IF THEY DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES AND HOW THE MONEY IS SPENT -- IT'S IT'S WITHIN THOSE AREAS OR BENEFITING THOSE AREAS AND SO -- AS AN EXAMPLE -- OUR RECENT SURVEY OF OF CARL MOYER GRANTS THAT WE'VE GIVEN OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS WITHIN THE BAY AREA AS IS ACTUALLY. PROVIDED MOST OF THAT FUNDING AND MOST OF THAT AIR MISSIONS BENEFITS TO AREAS LIKE WEST OAKLAND. ALAMEDA COUNTY AREA RICHMOND AREA IN PLACES THAT REALLY NEED IT THE MOST AND SO SO IT'S YOU KNOW THESE THESE PROGRAMS ARE DESIGNED TO GET THE EMISSIONS WHERE WHERE THEY'RE GOING. TO PROVIDE THE MOST BENEFIT AND I'M I'M ASSUMING THAT A A SMOG CHECK PROGRAM'S GONNA DO THE SAME THING BECAUSE IT'S GOING. TO REDUCE THE EMISSIONS OF THE TRUCKS THEY'RE DRIVING THROUGH THE IN THE AGGREGATE. SO I JUST DON'T REMEMBER THIS IS NOT A G. GIRAFFE. YEAH PROGRAMS AT THE CAN DIFFERENT [inaudible] STANDARD [inaudible] FOR YEAH. OKAY VERY GOOD I LOVE. AMBITIONS. GOOD HOPE SPRINGS ETERNAL. YEAH I DON'T KNOW IT'S GOOD. GOOD OKAY GOOD -- THE OTHER QUESTIONS THAT'S IN THE COMMITTEE. YES OKAY SO THE MOVES THE BILL'S REMOVED I THINK BAY CENTER HELL WE LOOK CLOSER.

WE NEED A WELL COORDINATED STE A STRATEGY BASED ON THE LATEST SCIENCE TO ENABLE OUR STATE TO BE RESILIENT ENOUGH TO MEET THESE ANOTHER INCREDIBLE CHALLENGES. YEAH IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN I AUTHORED SB TWO FOUR SIX WE ADDRESS THE LACK OF COMPREHENSIVE AND COORDINATED CLIMATE ADAPTATION PLANNING BETWEEN THE STATE. REGIONAL AND LOCAL ENTITIES IN CALIFORNIA THOSE WHO WERE ON THE COMMUNITY THAT TIME IT WAS FANTASTIC TO HAVE FOR SECRETARIES IN THE STATE COME BEFORE US AND TALK ABOUT HOW THE STATE WAS.

AND OTHER LEGISLATION LIKE A. B. TWENTY EIGHT HUNDRED SB THIRTY AB. FOURTEEN EIGHTY THREE HAVE HELPED. CALIFORNIANS. FOR THE EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE BUT STILL CALIFORNIANS ARE REMAIN AT TREMENDOUS RISK FROM WILDFIRE EXTREME HEAT. FLOOD. ARE DROUGHT AND AGAIN I'D LIKE TO EMPHASIZE THE PROBLEMS RELATED TO EXTREME HEAT. IT IS THE THING THAT IS GOING TO AFFECT MY AND ALL THE COMPOUNDING HEALTH EFFECTS FROM EXPOSURE TO EXTREME HEAT. WILL OUTSTRIP EVERY SINGLE OTHER. OF AFFECT OF CLIMATE CHANGE. HOWEVER OF WE NEED. TO EVEN THOUGH WE'VE HAD A GREAT START MORE ACTION IS NEEDED AND THAT'S THE ONE SIXTY EIGHT WILL BUILD ON THIS EXISTING SLATE OF GOOD LEGISLATION. AND BY PLACING. THE CHIEF RESILIENCE CLIMATE RESILIENCE OFFICER IN THE OFFICE OF PLANNING AND RESEARCH THEY'RE IN A POSITION.

CENTER THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP YEAR AFTER YEAR ON THIS ISSUE YOU CAN BANG THE DRUM SO. IT'S TIME WE GOT GOING -- I I LIKE THIS SORT OF VERTICAL AND HORIZONTAL. CAPACITY BUILDING. REFERENCE THERE THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE I THINK WE'RE SEEING IT. ON THE ON THE CLIMATE IMPACTS SIDE AT LEAST LOCAL GOVERNMENT IN PLANNING PERSPECTIVE IS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL RIGHT. AND SO. I JUST I WANT TO SEE THAT. I'M I'M READING THROUGH THE BILL. THE THE MORE CLEARLY WE CAN SEE THAT THAT THAT THIS IS OFFICER CAN BE A CAPACITY BUILDER FOR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN THEIR PLANNING EXERCISES THAT TO ME SEEMS LIKE ONE OF THE BIG IMPASSES WERE FACING AND SO IF THEY'RE ABLE TO BRING. I DON'T TECHNICAL MODELING ASSISTANCE -- YOU KNOW -- IS DIFFERENT LAND USE INCENTIVES OFTEN THE COOLEY I JUST DON'T KNOW HOW TO EVEN SCOPE THE PROBLEM OR OR EVEN WHAT THE SOLUTION SET MIGHT BE AND SO WE GET STUCK IN SORT O INCREMENTAL IS THINKING AND THEN THE STATE'S UP HERE AND SO LET'S BRIDGE THAT GAP ANYHOW.

ELEMENT THROUGHOUT ALL THE CHAPTERS THAT THEY HAVE SO YEAR YOUR SPOT ON ON ON HOW THAT'S GONNA WORK AND I GUESS YEAH. WOULD YOU DO I YEAH I THINK. I'M GONNA SCARE ANYBODY BUT MISTER PAUL FREEMAKE SAID. A COMPELLING ARGUMENT WE I THINK ALL THE OUR TENSION TODAY IS FOCUSED ON FIRES WE OR UNLESS WERE FROM THE MIDWEST WE'RE TALKING WE'RE FOCUSED ON FLOODS WERE CONCERNED ABOUT SEA LEVEL RISING IF WE LIVE IN THE BEAR ON THE COAST. WE GOT THE STORM SURGES WE WERE WELL AWARE OF DROUGHT -- AND WE'VE GOT PASSED WITH THAT. REAL PASSED THAT COME IN NOT NOT. LOBBYIST -- THEY COME IN BUT THE THE BIG ENCHILADA HERE IS THE EXTREME HEAT.

OKAY SO WITH THE THE BILL TO MOVE A SINISTER. AND THAT AND TOOK HER PLEASE CALL. ITEM NUMBER FOUR SP ONE SIXTY EIGHT BY SENATOR WHITE HOUSE SKI. THE MOTION IS DO PASS AS AMENDED TO THE SENATE NATURAL RESOURCES AND WATER COMMITTEE. ALLEN. ALLEN AYE BATES [inaudible] HILL [inaudible] SKINNER [inaudible] STERN. STERN AYE STONE [inaudible] BY CASKEY. I OKAY SO WHEN ONLY THE ROLE OPEN I HAVE FOUR OTHER MEMBERS OUT ON AND THEN PASS THE THE W. AND THAT YOU'RE AMERICA'S DUSKY FOR ME TO PRESENT ITEM. NUMBER TWO THAT'S SB FORTY THREE ALL RIGHT. IT IS ALMOST OVER THIS IS THE LAST STATE YOUR RESOURCE FOR IN THAT PART OF TAX AND FEE ADMINISTRATION WORKING TOGETHER. SENATOR ALLEN THAT'S WHAT WE'RE ALL ABOUT HERE SO THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS I JUST WANT TO THANK THE COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL AND TO THE DETAIL NOW SAYS. HI THIS BILL REQUIRES THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD AND THE MINISTRATION NEWLY EMPOWERED ADMINISTRATION WITH THEM IN THE WAKE OF THE OF THE BOARD BECAUSE ASIAN AND REVAMPS THE TO EVALUATE THE FEASIBILITY AND PRACTICALITY OF THE POSSIBILITY OF ADOPTING A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAX TO REPLACE THE CURRENT SALES AND USE TAX. SO -- ONCE AGAIN STUDY BILL JUST TAKING A LOOK AT IT -- AND IT'S ALSO AT THE IDEAS THE NEW NEUTRAL SO THAT NOBODY WOULD BE -- THAT THAT THAT THERE WOULDN'T BE HIGHER TAXES -- BUT THERE WOULD BE A DIFFERENT WAY OF TAXING SO WHILE THE CURRENT CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM. PLAYS AN INTEGRAL ROLE IN SHIFTING BEHAVIOR BY INCENTIVIZING BUSINESSES TO INVEST IN CLIMATE FRIENDLY TECHNOLOGIES. NOW THAT SYSTEM ULTIMATELY DOES VERY LITTLE TO TRICKLE DOWN TO EFFECT CHANGE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AND UNFORTUNATELY THINGS WE LEARN ABOUT TODAY -- WAS IT WAS WAS HOW DIFFICULT IT IS TO CHANGE CONSUMER BEHAVIOR. LAMENTING A REVENUE NEUTRAL PRICING MECHANISM BASED ON THE CARBON FOOTPRINT OF A PRODUCT WOULD OFFER A DIRECT FINANCIAL BENEFIT. TO THOSE WHO BY CARBON FRIENDLY PRODUCTS. I WHILE THOSE WHO CHOOSE OTHERWISE WOULD BE ASKED TO PAY A LITTLE EXTRA FOR THE IMPACTS. WE ALREADY USE OUR TAX POLICY SYSTEM TO IMPLEMENT ALL SORTS OF DIFFERENT GOALS FROM FOR EXAMPLE WE CHARGED AN ADDITIONAL THREE DOLLARS A DAY -- FOR EVERY PACK OF CIGARETTES WHICH IS REDUCE SMOKING RATES SIGNIFICANTLY. WHILE ON THE OTHER HAND IS A CITIES SUCH AS GROCERIES MEDICAL EQUIPMENT PRESCRIPTION DRUGS ARE EXEMPT FOM THE SALES TAX. MAKING THOSE ITEMS MORE AFFORDABLE TO THOSE WHO NEED THEM. THEY'RE CURRENTLY ABOUT FORTY DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS AROUND THE WORLD THAT HAVE ADOPTED SOME FORM OF CARBON PRICING WITH THE GOAL OF REDUCING EMISSIONS THROUGH CHANGING CONSUMER BEHAVIOR AT FOR EXAMPLE OF THE NETHERLANDS. DOESN'T HAVE A SPECIFIC CARBON TAX IT -- THERE WOULD BE CITY PURSUANT TO THIS BILL ACCOUNTS SHOW THAT DAY CURRENTLY PRICE ABOUT 94% OF THEIR OWN EMISSIONS CAUSED BY THE ENERGY USE IN IN THE NETHERLANDS SO. I EMISSIONS CAUSED BY AGRICULTURE AND FISHING ROAD OTHERS THAT ARE TAX IN THE NETHERLANDS SO THIS IS MERELY A STUDY BILL -- BUT IT WOULD AT IT ASKS THE THE FOLKS TO TAKE A LOOK AT THIS IDEA. AND AND I JUST WANT -- TO TO PREVENT THE SIZE THAT IF IT ULTIMATELY ENDS UP THAT THEY TAKE A LONG HARD LOOK AT THIS AND DECIDE THAT EVEN IF IT'S A GREAT IDEA CONCEPTUALLY BUT IT'S JUST TOO IMPRACTICAL. TO IMPOSE BECAUSE FIGURING OUT THE CARBON PRICES IT WITH INITIAL PROJECT PRODUCT -- IS GONNA BE TOO DIFFICULT -- WE DON'T HAVE TO DO IT AND IN FACT THE BEAR BUT MAY JUST COME BACK TO US AND SAY LOOK YOU KNOW IT'S IT'S TOO IMPRACTICAL BUT WE DO THINK IT'S A GOOD IDEA FOR US TO LOOK AT TO CONSIDER. AND I I DO EMPHASIZE AGAIN THAT THIS IS A REVENUE NEUTRAL IDEA THAT WRE ALREADY WE HAVE A REGRESSIVE TAX IN PLACE IN THE FORM OF THE SALES TAX WE WOULD GET RID OF THAT STATE SALES TAX ALTOGETHER IF THIS -- AND AND AND AND STUDY THE IDEA OF REPLACING IT WITH A REVENUE NEUTRAL CARBON TAX WITH ME TODAY WE HAVE -- MICHELLE Và SERAPHINA TO CONSERVANCY WAS GONNA TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. I THANK HIM SHALL PASS FROM THE DIRECTOR OF THE NATURE CONSERVANCY'S CALIFORNIA CLIMATE CHANGE PROGRAM -- AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK AND THANK YOU SENATOR ALLEN FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THIS TOPIC. OUT WE DO AGREE AND I'M THAT SB FORTY THREE IS REALLY AN IMPORTANT STUDY BILL THAT WOULD PROVIDE CALIFORNIA WITH ADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND TOOLS. THAT CAN INFORM OUR ONGOING CONVERSATIONS ABOUT HOW WE CAN REDUCE EMISSIONS EVEN FURTHER THREE TAX THAT WOULD BE IN LIEU OF THE SALES AND USE TAX. I'M IT COULD ALSO COMPLEMENT THE A CLIMATE EFFORTS THAT WE HAVE UNDER WAY RIGHT NOW. AT THIS POINT WE NEED ALL THE INFORMATION WE CAN GET TO UNDERSTAND HOW WE CAN ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE MOST EFFECTIVELY AND AGGRESSIVELY -- AND MANY OF YOU MAY KNOW LAST FALL OR BE AWARE OF THE REPORT THAT WAS RELEASED BY THE INTERGOVERNMENTAL PANEL ON CLIMATE CHANGE -- THAT. ISSUED A REPORT HIGHLIGHTING THE GLOBAL URGENCY TO BECOME CARBON NEUTRAL IF NOT CARBON NEGATIVE BY THE YEAR. TWO THOUSAND FIFTY PEOPLE OVERALL TEMPERATURES FROM INCREASING NO MORE THAN ONE AND A HALF DEGREES CELSIUS THIS IS COMPARED TO PRE INDUSTRIAL -- TIMES. THIS I. P. C. C. REPORT FILED YOU IN PARIS AGREEMENT WHERE COUNTRIES AROUND THE WORLD COMMITTED TO KEEP OUR TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW A TWO DEGREE CELSIUS INCREASE. DEVOID THE MOST CATASTROPHIC IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE WHICH WE ARE ALREADY STARTING TO FEEL -- CALIFORNIA HAS BEEN A CLIMATE LEADER. AND WILL NEED TO DO MORE IF WE WANT TO DO OUR PART TO SUPPORT THE PARIS AGREEMENT. AND HEED THE GUIDANCE OF THIS I. P. C. C. REPORT -- SB FORTY THREE IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO UNDERSTAND THE VIABILITY AND EFFECTIVENESS IS UNDERGROUND DIFFERENT TO OF ANOTHER TOOL TO HELP US IN THIS EFFORT -- IT MAY ALSO HELP IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR US TO COLLABORATE WITH OTHER STATES WHO ARE EXAMINING CARBON TAXES AS A WAY TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS. WHO DO YOU WORK YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL THE COMMANDER COULD BE A PART OF OUR OVERALL CLIMATE CHANGE SOLUTION? THANK YOU. THANK YOU OTHER OTHERS HERE IN SUPPORT OF SB [inaudible] FORTY THREE THIS IS [inaudible] THE NEUTRAL -- SALES AND USE CARBON TAX STUDY BILL. WHICH IS COMPOUND. WE HEAR. FROM SUPPORT IS LOOKING YEAH YEAH WE'RE OF A STATEWIDE ORGANIZATION WITH SEVEN HUNDRED ONLINE SUPPORTERS AND PASTA FOR CALIFORNIA WORKS TO AND FINANCIAL SUPPORT. FOR THE CLIMATE DAMAGING FOSSIL FUELS AND TO PROMOTE A JUST TRANSITION TO A LOW CARBON ECONOMY. ALONG THESE LINES WE SUPPORT A STUDY -- THE STUDY WHICH IS A NEED A UNIQUE APPROACH TO THE PROBLEM. OF REDUCING FINANCIALS FINANCIAL AID FOR FOSSIL FUELS ALONG THE LINES OF CARBON INTENSITY WE ALSO THINK THAT THE INFORMATION THAT COULD BE GUARDED FROM THIS BILL ABOUT THE CARBON INTENSITY OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS WOULD JUST BE IMPORTANT FOR CONSUMERS. ANA TO KNOW -- I'D ALSO LIKE TO INDICATE SUPPORT FROM TWO OTHER OF THREE FIFTY GROUP SO CAL THREE FIFTY CLIMATE ACTION AND THREE FIFTY SOUTH BAY LOS ANGELES. THANK YOU THANK YOU FOR INTRODUCING THIS. MIX. CAN A GAL YOUR FOR THREE FIFTY SACRAMENTO IN STRONG SUPPORT AND THANK YOU TO SENATOR ALLEN. SENATE **** FOR THE THREE FIFTY SILICON VALLEY THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THIS NON REGRESSIVE. TAX ON CARBON FABULOUS. AND WE'LL DO WHAT WE CAN HELP. OKAY LET'S SEE HERE FROM OPPOSITION IS ANYBODY HERE -- OPPOSED TO THIS STUDY BILL PERHAPS. PLEASE COME. FOR GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND CHAIR I WANNA START BY THINKING THE SENATOR AND HIS OFFICE FOR MANY CONVERSATIONS THAT WE'VE HAD I HAVE BEEN A PASSED TO ME ENOUGH FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS FOR SURE SO I APPRECIATE THAT BEING NEW TO CALIFORNIA. THE CLEVER PARTY'S BEEN REALLY HELPFUL I WANT TO START OFF BY SAYING WE'RE NOT OPPOSED TO A STUDY BILL THAT SOMETHING THAT CALIFORNIA'S GOOD AT COMING UP WITH NEW IDEAS -- BUT I DO WANT TO EXPRESS A COUPLE OF CONCERNS THAT WE RAISED TO THE CENTER AND TO HIS STAFF ABOUT THE SCOPE OF A STUDY IN MAKING SURE THAT CARB. AND ANY OTHER AGENCY THIS INVOLVED IN EVALUATING SUCH A BIG TAX. WILL A VALUE IS PART OF THE STUDY. SO. AN EVALUATION OF THE CARBON INTENSITY OF TAX ON EVERY SINGLE PRODUCT IN CALIFORNIA OF WHICH THERE ARE MILLIONS IS A VERY INTENSIVE CONCEPT. SOUL THE FACTORS THAT GO INTO EVALUATING THE CARBON INTENSITY CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE TRANSPORTATION. THEY CAN INCLUDE THINGS LIKE LIVESTOCK AND PRODUCTION MAKING LEWD THINGS -- SUCH AS THE WHERE THE STEELERS MANUFACTURED SO SOME OF OUR MANUFACTURERS FOR EXAMPLE HAVE FACILITY THERE IN TWO PLACES IN CALIFORNIA. YOU TO THINK ABOUT HOW DO THE DIFFERENT LOW FOR ANYA. GO INTO THAT CARBON INTENSITY. THE LIFE CYCLE ANALYSIS IS AN ENTIRE DIVISION WITHIN CARP. ON IT SAID IT'S A VERY INTENSE STUDY IN A VERY INTENSE VALUATION -- I ALSO WANTED TO RAISE AN ISSUE THAT WE DID TALK TO THE A CENTER STAFF ABOUT WHICH IS DATA GATHERING AND I THINK THIS IS RAISED IN THE COMMITTEE THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS. FOR BUSINESSES HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE WAIT DATA WOULD BE GATHERED AND WOULD BE REPORTED AND THEN HOW WE WOULD MAINTAIN THE PRIVACY OF THAT DATA THAT WOULD BE SHARED WITH THE IT RESOURCES BOARD. ON WHEELS HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT HOW DO YOU GET THAT DATA FROM OUT OF STATE PARTS THAT COME INTO CALIFORNIA. THERE'S A LOT OF INTERPLAY IN JUST THE CARBON INTENSITY EVALUATION ALLOWED. THERE'S ALSO AN ISSUE OF IF WE'RE GOING TO CHANG THE MARKET PLACE IN THE WAY BUYERS PURCHASE PRODUCTS WE HAVE TO THINK ABOUT BEHAVIORAL ECONOMICS IS AN ENTIRE FIELD OF STUDY. THAT WAS REALLY BROUGHT INTO LIGHT IN THE EIGHTIES AND NINETIES WE DON'T HAVE A LOT AN AGENCY THAT REALLY LOOKS AT HOW TO CONSUMERS MAKE PURCHASING DECISIONS. THAT KIND OF ANALYSIS WOULD ENTAIL THINGS LIKE RE DOING RETAIL POINT OF SALE PRODUCTS TOM HOW DO WE PUT LABELS ON THE SHELVES SO CONSUMERS REALLY UNDERSTAND WHAT PORTION OF THE TAXES ARE. RESULTING FROM HIGHER LUXURY GOOD AND WHAT PORTION THE TACK OR PORTION OF THE PRICES RESULTING FROM THE CARBON TAX. WE REALLY NEED WHOEVER'S EVALUATING ALL THOSE ASPECTS FROM THE MARKET PLACE -- AND THAT'S ONE OF THE REASONS WE HAD EXPRESSED SOME CONCERN TO THE CENTERS OFFICE ABOUT INCLUDING MORE THAN JUST CARBON THE DEPARTMENT TAX WE THINK OTHER -- AGENCIES ALSO BE INCLUDED IN THIS EVALUATION BECAUSE THIS IS OUTSIDE OF THE NORMAL SCOPE OF WHAT CAR DOES WE WERE TALKING ABOUT OVERHAULING THE TAX STRUCTURE THIS IS THIS IS A BIG STUDY -- AND FINALLY WANTED TO TOUCH ON CALIFORNIA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE ENVIRONMENTAL WORLD I MEAN WE HAVE WE HAVE A THEY THEY ARE CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM. AND THAT CAP AND TRADE PROGRAM NEEDS TO BE TAKEN INTO CONSIDERATION WILL THIS CARBON TAX REPLACE ALL OF OUR CARBON POLICIES IN CALIFORNIA. WILL EVALUATING A CARBON TAX. DISCOURAGE OTHER STATES FROM INVESTING AND LINKING WITH OUR CAP AND TRADE. I THINK IT'S PART OF THE STUDY ONE OF THE HINGS WE WOULD ANT TO MAKE SURE THAT CARD IS LOOKING AT IS THE IMPACTS ON THE OTHER CARBON POLICIES. IN CALIFORNIA INCLUDING WHETHER WE HAVE CREDITS FOR FACILITIES THAT ARE ALREADY SUBJECT CAPPING TRADER OTHER CARBON EMISSIONS. AND WE THINK WE NEED TO DO A FULL EVALUATION OF THAT INCLUDING THE IMPACTS ON TRANSPORTATION DOLLARS WHICH MIGHT RESULT FROM THE DECREASING CONSUMPTION FOOL FUEL -- AND INCLUDING THE DECREASE IN OVERALL A A COME TO THE STATE. OF THESE REASONS WE'VE WE'VE WE APPRECIATE THE EFFORTS OF THE OFFICE TO WORK WITH US AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO BUT FOR THESE REASONS WE ARE OPPOSE LESS AMENDED [inaudible] NECKS. THANK YOU MY NAME IS DERAIL COOK I'M HERE FOR THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND ASSOCIATION. WE ALL THOSE TO THIS BILL WE RECOGNIZE HOWEVER THAT WE ARE EARLY IN THE PROCESS AND WE INTEND TO HAVE MORE ENGAGEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR AND HIS STAFF -- AS THIS BILL MOVES FORWARD -- THE REASON WHY WE ARE OPPOSE EVEN THOUGH THE BILL IS A STUDY BILL IS NO MATTER HOW WE DEVISE A CARBON TAX AT THE STATE LEVEL. IT'S GOING TO HAVE DEEP ISSUES OF WORK ABILITY AND INVITE ARBITRARINESS THAT WILL ULTIMATELY DISADVANTAGED CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY AND STYMIE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE WITH OUR OUR OUR GLOBAL COMPETITION. WE INTEND TO DISCUSS THOSE ISSUES. MORE IN DEPTH AS THERE WERE A AS THIS BILL MOVES FOWARD INTO -- COMMITTEES RELATED TO TAX POLICIES THAT'S WHERE A LOT OF OUR ISSUES -- FIT -- BUT BEFORE THIS COMMITTEE WE WANT TO EMPHASIZE THAT THE APPROACH THAT THIS -- CARBON TAX REPRESENTS BURNS TO UPSET THE BALANCE THAT WE REACHED. WITH BIPARTISAN SUPPORT WITH RELATION TO A CAP AND TRADE OF MANUFACTURERS HAVE BEEN AT THE TABLE AS PARTNERS TO THAT SOLUTION AND OTHER EFFORTS. TO REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS. NOW WE ARE INVESTING IN -- M. PRODUCING SOLUTIONS IN AMERICAN SYSTEM OF CAP AND TRADE -- TO TO PRODUCE MORE GREENLEE AND D. CARBONIZED CALIFORNIA -- THE SUCCESSFUL EFFORTS ARE THREATENED IF WE MAKE IT USING CALIFORNIA AND THE CARBON TAX REPRESENTS SUCH A THREAT A MANUFACTURER'S ALREADY FACE THE HIGHEST ENERGY COSTS IN THE NATION -- AND COMPOUNDING THOSE COSTS WITH THE COST OF UP. REBEKAH ACQUIRING COMPONENTS ONLY INCREASES OUR COSTS AS WE FACE THE SAME ISSUE AS WE HAVE WITH OTHER THAT CHANGES TO THE TAX SCHEME WHERE ARE COMPONENTS THAT WE ACQUIRE WILL FACE A TAX -- AND THEN WE ALTERNATE LEAVE AND HAVE MULTIPLE COMPONENTS THAT HAVE BEEN TAX RAISING PRICES OF THE GOODS THAT WE PRODUCE -- SO. IN. THE END RESULT IS THE CARBON TAX -- THAT A CARBON TAX ULTIMATELY ENCOURAGES OUT OF STATE PRODUCTION A BECAUSE OF CERTAIN SYSTEMIC AND STRUCTURAL ISSUES WITH THE CARBON TAX AT THE STATE LEVEL THAT WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS WHERE WE pCONTROLS -- AND AND IN DOING SO THAT'S COUNTERPRODUCTIVE TO OUR OUR GREEN GOALS HERE BECAUSE WHAT HAPPENS IS LEAKAGE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS WE BECOMES TOO HARD TO PRODUCE -- DO SO OUT OF STATE AND IF WE DON'T PRODUCE OUT OF STATE WHAT HAPPENS THAT WE ARE OUT COMPETED BY FOLKS FROM OTHER COUNTRIES AND OTHER STATES DON'T HAVE THESE -- CARBON CAPTURING -- CALIFORNIA VALUES AND SO FOR THOSE REASONS BUT WE ARE POST. OKAY PUBLIC HEARING WHAT'S YOUR FROM OTHER SUPPOSED. TO SB THIRTY FORTY THREE YEAH JOHN WINGER IBF THE CALIFORNIA FEELS AND CONVENIENCE ALLIANCE WE LINER COMETS WITH -- THE CHAMBER PARTICULARLY AROUND THE QUESTIONS ON RETAIL PRODUCTS AND OKAY. WELL WE ALL AGREED IS COMPLICATED STUDY AND EXPENSE OF OTHERS PEOPLE OF COURSE STERN -- INTERESTING LEGISLATION CENTER ALLEN AT I DO APPRECIATE YOU PUSHING THE ENVELOPE HERE AND STARTING TO THINK THROUGH A LITTLE MORE COMPREHENSIVELY JUST HOW. HOW HONEST WERE BEING ABOUT? OUR PROGRESS IN IN THIS STATE ON CLIMATE CHANGE BECAUSE IT'S ONE THING. TO TO HEAR THE A CARBON TARGET -- BY TWENTY THIRTY FROM ALL SOURCES OF EMISSIONS THAT WE CONTRACT IN STATE LIKE A MANUFACTURER. OUR UTILITY -- OUR DRIVER BUT WE CONSUME A LOT OF THINGS WE THINGS MOVE IN AND OUT THERE THERE'S A THERE'S A LOT MORE TO THE STORY THAN JUST -- THE WAY WE SORT OF TARGET SOURCES RIGHT NOW SOME. I I GET THE INITIAL VERSION FROM FROM INDUSTRY. THIS OUR CONCEPT I THINK JUST FLOATING THE WORD TAX EVEN OUT THERE IMMEDIATELY IS GOING TO SET PEOPLE OFF BUT I DO THINK THAT. I'M I'M NOT CONVINCED THAT THERE'S SOMETHING INHERENTLY DISCRIMINATORY ABOUT -- LOOKING AT A MORE ACCURATE -- ASSESSMENT OF SORT OF WHERE THE CAR BEEN IS -- BEING EMITTED IN OTHER WORDS -- I THINK THAT IN STATE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCERS AND OTHERS. HE COULD POTENTIALLY GAIN IF YOU CAN GET OVER THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONCERNS WHICH I THINK ARE UNDERLYING. THE MTA'S POINT OF YOU WHERE THEY'RE SAYING YOU CAN'T IMPOSE A DORMANT. A CARBON PRICE IN A WAY THAT DISCRIMINATES AGAINST -- INTERSTATE COMMERCE BUT SOMEONE WORTH LOOKING AT GOING FORWARD IF YOU IF THERE'S SOME WAY TO LOOK AT A NON DISCRIMINATORY ASSESSMENT ON THE CARBON SIDE AND IT YEAH AND THEN IN A WAY THAT. YOU'RE WEIGHING THE HEALTH AND SAFETY BURNS ON THE STATE. AND YOU'RE LOOKING AT THE PURPOSE OF THIS BECAUSE I DON'T SEE THE PURPOSE OF THIS IS HER SURE BIASING ONE INDUSTRY AGAINST ANOTHER BUT MORE SO JUST TRYING TO GET IN ON THIS PICTURE OF WHAT WE'RE DEALING WITH SELF SO MANY CONSIDER GOING FOR TO HAPPEN MOVE THE BILL. TO THE APPROPRIATE TIME. EXACTLY IN HERE I I JUST WANT TO SAY -- YOU KNOW A COUPLE KEY THINGS IN RESPONSE TO MY FRIENDS FROM FROM FROM INDUSTRY -- IF IF THIS. SIX TWO IF IF IF. IT IS ABSOLUTE NOT MY INTENTION IN FACT I WOULD OPPOSE ANY ATTEMPT. TO MAKE THIS BILL INTO SOMETHING THAT DISADVANTAGES CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS. THAT IS. IT WOULD IT WOULD OP SEE CENTRAL TO THIS. IS A A FIFTH ANYTHING IF ANYTHING THE MANUFACTURES WITH THIS A CALIFORNIA WOULD WOULD LIKELY HAVE MORE TO GAIN FROM SOMETHING LIKE THIS -- BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT THEY TEND FOLKS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE COUNTRY IN THE WORLD -- SO SO THE OTHER I JUST WANNA MAKE THAT IT ENORMOUSLY CLEAR -- THAT -- THE THIS THIS THIS THEY THEY THEY DID IT WE CANNOT BE THAT ARE ANYTHING THAT WILL COME OUT OF THIS BILL. WOULD -- DECIDE TO JUST PRICE BASED ON CALIFORNIA'S MANUFACTURING IS TOO DIFFICULT TO ORDER TO ANY CONSTITUTIONAL ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH -- WITH WITH WITH LOOKING A PRODUCTS COMING FROM OUT OF THE STATE AND I WOULD NEVER WANT TO PURSUE. ANYTHING ALONG THE LINES OF THIS IF IF IT WERE IF THAT WERE NOT TO BE THE CASE. I MEANONE CAN IMAGINE THE STAFF REPORT TALKS ABOUT -- THE REGRESSIVE NATURE THE ALLEY -- AND THREE FIFTY REPORTED ON IT BUT ONE COULD IMAGINE -- AND AIRPORT TAX FOR MEASURING THE CARBON THAT YOU USE ON THE FLIGHT AS YOU EXIT IN THE FLIGHT IF YOU COME IN DOESN'T AFFECT MANUFACTURING. THE NOT A LOT OF POOR PEOPLE GET NON -- A FLIGHT -- TO INTERNATIONAL DESTINATIONS BUT CALCULATE THAT CARBON BECAUSE WE CAN'T TAX THE FUEL BECAUSE THAT'S FEDERAL REGULATION BUT WE COULD TAX THE MILES THEY WERE -- SOMEBODY. THE SMARTER THAN I AM COULD CALCULATE WHAT GREENHOUSE GASES WHEN YOU'RE TRAVELING ACROSS THE THE PLACE AND IT'S IT'S NEUTRAL TO THE CHAMBER NEUTRAL TO THE MANUFACTURERS. N. AND IT'S NOT. IT'S NOT PER SE -- REGRESSIVE I MEAN THAT THAT AVERAGE SMALL THEIR AVERAGE POOR FAMILY GOES ONE TRIP TO DISNEYLAND IS NOT GOING TO FEEL IT FIRST IS THE INTERNATIONAL TRAVELER TRAVELER FROM MARIN COUNTY THAT'S TAKEN. THREE TRIPS TO HONG KONG EVERY WEEK JUST PAY AN END. TO THAT POINT I'VE BEEN SENATOR I IF IF WE WERE TO REMEMBER WE ARE WE IT WOULD ACTUALLY POTENTIALLY BE PROGRESSIVE IN THAT CASE BECAUSE THIS BILL ANTICIPATES DING AWAY. ENTIRELY WITH THE STATE SALES TAX. SO THT THE REGRESSIVE SALES TAX THAT WE HAVE AS A MAJOR CHEN REVENUE GENERATOR RIGHT NOW WOULD BE POTENTIALLY REPLACED BY THAT THAT SORT OF MECHANISM. I SEE NO OTHER -- WE'VE WE'RE ALMOST AT THREE O'CLOCK WE HAVE A MOTION BY SANDOR STERN. YOU WOULD YOU LIKE TO ADD ANYTHING ELSE I WILL BUY ONE I DO WANT TO FAKE I ACTUALLY WANT TO SAY THAT -- I AGREE WITH NEARLY EVERYTHING THAT THE AND THE CHAMBER BROUGHT UP I THINK THAT THESE ARE ALL EVERYTHING YOU BROUGHT UP OUGHT TO BE LOOKED AT AND ENGAGE WITH AND AND AND RESEARCH AS PART OF THIS STUDY. AND AS I SAY I'LL REPEAT AGAIN WHEN I SAID THE BEGINNING IF IF IT TURNS OUT THAT THAT IS JUST ON FEASIBLE THAT IT'S UNWORKABLE I DON'T WANT TO MOVE FORWARD WITH IT -- AS A AS A AS A MATTER OF POLICY AYE BUT I DO THINK THIS OUGHT TO BE SOMETHING THAT WE LOOK AT AND WE DOES FROM TIME. TO TO TO JUST EXAMINE AND I I I SAY I SEE RESPECTFULLY TO MY FRIEND FROM THE MANUFACTURERS REMEMBER. THAT I THAT THE THE WHILE THIS MAY REYES BECAUSE GETTING RID OF THE SALES TAX -- IN THE STATE AND IT IS OBVIOUSLY IMPORTANT TO ME THAT THIS THIS NOT DISCRIMINATE IS NOT DISADVANTAGED. CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS -- IF ANYTHING -- I I THINK WE OUGHT TO FIGURE OUT A WAY THAT THIS WOULD HELP CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURES BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT SO MANY OF THEM ARE. OPERATING IN A MORE GREEN WAY AND SO I I THINK THAT WE COULD FIGURE OUT A WAY TO TO TO GET GET EVERYONE ON BOARD WITH THIS BECAUSE OF THE FACT THAT YOU'VE RAISED ISSUES THAT OUGHT TO BE PART OF THE STUDY IN -- WITH THAT I I RESPECT AS FOR A VOTE THIS IS THIS IS THIS IS GETTING RID OF THE SALES AND USE TAX IT'S A IT'S A IT'S A REVENUE NEUTRAL MODEL -- BUT IT'S ULTIMATELY STUDY AND IT'S ALL ABOUT FIGURE OUT A WAY WHETHER THIS IS FEASIBLE OR NOT MOTION BY SENATOR STERN DO YOU PASSED THE GOVERNMENT FINANCE.
