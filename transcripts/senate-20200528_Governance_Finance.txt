FIVE THE COURTESY FRANKLY OF LET ME GO FIRST TODAY AND OF COURSE TO REPRESENT THE BILL. EARLIER THIS YEAR THIS IS A SIDE THE TERENCE. OFF PLAY THAT THERE WERE BE A HOUSING PACKAGE OF LEGISLATION THIS YEAR I THINK WE ALL UNDERSTAND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS- PRE CODED WE HAD A HOUSING CRISIS. IT'S ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BECAUSE OF COVRT NINETEEN. I WANT TO THANK THE CHAIRMAN ALONG WITH SENATORS COVER YEAR ROAD THERE ALSO CAN SALAS HILL ROTH AND RUBIO. FOR STEPPING UP TO LEAD THE DISCUSSION ON THIS ISSUE WITH ME. SB ELEVEN TWENTY IS PART OF THE HOUSING PRODUCTION PACKAGE THAT WAS ANNOUNCED LAST WEEK IT MAKES MORE HOUSING PRODUCTION POSSIBLE. EVEN WHILE WE CONTINUE WORKING THROUGH THE NEW REALITIES AND ON CERTAIN TIMES BECAUSE BY THIS PANDEMIC. AND OF COURSE OUR ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IN POSITIONS CALIFORNIA TO LEAP FORWARD EXPONENTIALLY ON HOUSING PRODUCTION AS CIRCUMSTANCES EASE. I MAKING SURE THE RECOVERY PROVIDES OPPORTUNITY AT ALL INCOME LEVELS THE BILL BEFORE YOU TODAY SB ELEVEN TWENTY AUTOMATICALLY ALLOWS PROPERTY OWNERS TO HAVE DUPLEXES. AND SUBDIVIDE THEIR PROPERTY IN SINGLE FAMILY HOME NEIGHBORHOOD STATEWIDE AS LONG AS EXISTING OR PLANNED RESIDENCES CONTINUE TO MEET EXISTING COMMUNITY STANDARDS AND PROTECTIONS. SB ELEVEN TWENTY BILLS ON ARE INCREDIBLY SUCCESSFUL APPROACH TO ASSESS THREE DWELLING UNITS OR A. D. U.'S. WHICH HAS LED TO A QUADRUPLING OF APPLICATIONS FOR THESE UNITS IN MOST METRO AREAS IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. SB ELEVEN TWENTY THE PRO TO ALSO MAKE SMALL SCALE INFILL DEVELOPMENT MORE ACHIEVABLE IT HELPS BUILD EQUITY FOR INDIVIDUAL HOMEOWNERS NOT LARGE SCALE CORPORATIONS. AND FINALLY THE BILL RESPECTS THE PRIORITIES OF LOCAL GOVERNMENTS IN LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS. IN ORDER TO ACCESS THE PROVISIONS OF THE BILL HOMEOWNERS MUST MEET A SPECIFIC LIST OF QUALIFICATIONS. THAT ENSURE PROTECTION OF LOCAL ZONING AND DESIGN STANDARDS HISTORIC DISTRICTS ENVIRONMENTAL QUALITY AND EXISTING TENANTS VULNERABLE TO DISPLACEMENT. MISTER CHAIRMAN I'M HAPPY TO WORK WITH YOU TO CLARIFY THE ISSUES THAT WERE RAISED IN THE ANALYSIS REGARDING- DEFINITIONS. AND I THANK YOU FOR THAT INFORMATION. I ALSO WANT TO ACKNOWLEDGE A DRAFTING ERROR IN THE CURRENT VERSION OF THE BILL WHICH ONLY EXEMPTS SPECIFIC SITES ON HISTORIC REGISTER I WILL BE AMENDING THE BILL AT THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY TO CLARIFY THAT THIS EXEMPTION EXTENDS TO THE ENTIRE HISTORIC DISTRICT. SOMEONE TO MAKE SURE AND TAKE CARE OF THOSE. ICAL PIECES AT A BEEN A POINTED OUT. I UNDERSTAND SOME COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE STATE ARE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT PHYSICAL CHANGES THIS MAY BRING TO THEIR NEIGHBORHOODS AND I KNOW THAT CHANGE CAN BE SCARY. IT NEVER BEFORE HAS AFFORDABLE HOUSING AND SO CLEARLY A MATTER OF LIFE AND DEATH OVERCROWDING ON AFFORDABLE RENTS HOMELESSNESS THESE WERE ALL SYMPTOMS AS I SAID EARLIER. OF OUR HOUSING CRISIS LONG BEFORE COVE IN NINETEEN. THE ROLE OF GOVERNMENT I BELIEVE IS TO STEP IN WHEN THERE IS A CRISIS MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE'S VOICES ARE HEARD.

YES SENATOR WIENER GOOD MORNING SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN- PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR OF THIS BILL AND ALL. I WANTED TO US REALLY THANK. THE PRO TEM FOR NOT JUSTICE BUILD BUT FOR- DOING WHAT SHE SAID SHE WASGOING TO DO BACK IN JANUARY SHE- SAID VERY FIRMLY WE ARE GOING TO DO PRODUCTION THIS YEAR. AND HONESTLY WHEN THE PANDEMIC HIT- A LOT OF PEOPLE SAID TO ME IT'S NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN NEVER GOING TO HAPPEN- YOU KNOW WE NEED THE- PEOPLE ORGAN ONLY FOCUS. ON THE PANDEMIC. I TOLD THEM I DON'T THINK THAT WAS THE CASE- BECAUSE WE CAN WALK AND CHEW GUM AT THE SAME TIME AND WHAT WE'RE DOING WITH THIS TERRIBLE HEALTH EMERGENCY AND ECONOMIC EMERGENCY. WE DO HAVE TO FOCUS ON SOME OF THE COREISSUES THAT ARE THREATENING THE FUTURE OF OUR STATE BECAUSE- THE PANDEMIC IS GOING TO AND THE QUESTION IS ARE WE GOING TO THEN BE EVEN FURTHER BEHIND. ON HOUSING- AND SO. THIS IS A- AND THIS IN PARTICULAR THIS BILL. IS A REALLY SMART APPROACH BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT THERE ARE GOING TO BE ECONOMIC IMPACTS ON THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY- AND YOU KNOW HIGH I HOPE THEIR MINIMIZE% BUT- FROM THE LARGE SCALE CONSTRUCTION. IN PARTICULAR AND FINANCING THERE COULD BE SOME DELAYS- BUT I MEAN WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT THIS LATER TOUCHY SMALLER PROJECTS. THE DUPLEX IN HERE BECAUSE OF A LOT SPLIT ITS TWO DUPLEXES POTENTIALLY ON A- LOT THAT IS LARGE ENOUGH. THESE ARE MUCH LOWER COST WAYS OF ADDING HOUSING. THIS IS HOUSING THAT CAN BE ADDED EVEN DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. IT IS LATER TOUCH. IN TERMS OF CHANGES PHYSICALLY. IN A COMMUNITY I THINK IT STRIKES A REALLY STRONG BALANCE- THE- SOME OF THE PROVISIONS- IN IN THE BILL AROUND DEMOLITION OTHERWISE I THINK ALSO STRIKE. A REALLY STRONG BALANCE OF THIS IS A REALLY. SOLID SOLID BILL THAT OVER TIME. WILL RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF NEW HOUSING IN CALIFORNIA. A VERY HUMAN SCALE- THE DOESN'T YOU KNOW CHANGE THE HEIGHT LIMITS OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT AND- FOR SOME OF US TO- THING TYPE CAN BE A GOOD THING- YOU KNOW WE WANT TO. STRIKE A BALANCE AND EVEN IN SB FIFTY WE OFTEN DEFERRED. TO LOCAL HEIGHT LIMITS IN THIS BILL DOES THAT NOTS INAPPROPRIATE. THINGS WELL AS LOCAL DESIGN STANDARDS SO. ON THIS IS A REALLY STRONG BILL AND I'M PROUD TO BE A JOINT AUTHOR AND I WANT TO THANK. THE PRO TEMPORE HER LEADERSHIP. THANK YOU SO MUCH CENTER WIENER BREAK. THIS TO THE JURY LEADER MR HERTZBERG. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN. I JUST WANTED TO SHARE A COUPLE OF THOUGHTS BECAUSE I LIVE IN IN REPRESENT COMMUNITIES IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. WHERE THE UNDERLYING OF FOUNDATION OF THIS BILL HAS WORKED BRILLIANTLY. I THINK IN THE COMMUNITIES I REPRESENT AS WELL OVER FIVE THOUSAND A TO USEAS WE- IN THE LOS ANGELES DELEGATION WHICH IS ORGANIZED REALLY WELL NOW AND WE'VE HAD SERIES OF MEETINGS AND SERIES OF MEETINGS WITH EXPERTS ON HOUSING. WHAT'S THE PROBLEM WE'RE TRYING TO SOLVE HOW DO WE GET THERE HOW DO WE DO QUICKLY. WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BE ABLE TO JUST WRITE CHECKS FOR EVERYTHING. AND WHAT THIS POLICY DOES AND YOU KNOW I ABLE FIVE THOUSAND EIGHTY USE. IN THE COMMUNITIES THAT I REPRESENT HE IS A- YOU BEING ABLE TO GET HOUSING FAST WHICH IS REALLY IMPORTANT BECAUSE A LOT OF THIS STUFF ABOUT HOUSING IS OLD PERMITS IN YEARS AND TIME. TO IT'S BETWEEN THE COMMITTEES I REPRESENT BETWEEN FORTY AND A HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS PER DOOR. RATHER THAN WE'RE SPENDING IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY JUST ON GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES HUNDRED AND FIFTY THOUSAND. SO YOU GET IT QUICK. YOU PUT THE COMMUNITY TO WORK. AND I WILL TELL YOU THAT LAST YEAR THE YEAR BEFORE I CAN'T RECALL. THE NORTHEAST SAN FERNANDO VALLEY WHICH IS MARK MARK MOSTLY LATINO APPLIED FOR A TRANSFORMATIONAL GRANT FOR THIS STRATEGIC OF COUNSEL. AND PART OF THAT EFFORT WAS YOU HAD MAKE SHOWING THAT YOU HAD A HOUSING COMPONENT AND THE GROUP ARE LED BY BECOMING THE BEAUTIFUL BASICALLY INSTEAD OF SAYING WELL WE'RE GONNA WAIT FIVE YEARS TO BUILD BUT TO BUILD BUILDINGS THEIR ENTIRE TRANSFORMATIONAL PLAN SENATE AROUND THE NOTION OF EIGHTY USE. THAT'S WHAT THEY DID THAT WAS THEIR PLAN AND IT WAS ACCEPTED AND WE GOT TWENTY THREE MILLION DOLLARS AND THAT'S THE FOCUS IS TOO FEW MARY THIS WITH WHAT WITH WHAT WE'VE ALREADY DONE WAS AN ACCOUNT SKI CENTERS SKINNER MR TANG AND THE LIKE FROM MY PERSPECTIVE THIS IS REALLY DOES IN A VERY ELEGANT WAY- DEAL WITH THE ISSUE. GET UNITS AND IS WERE FACING THESE FINANCIAL CHALLENGES IT'S A WAY TO PUT PUT UNITS UP WITHOUT A DELAY BE GETTING PEOPLE TO WORK. AND SHE WITHOUT HUGE GOVERNMENTAL SUBSIDIES BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU- YOU KNOW ON THE GROUND IT'S NOT JUST POLICY IT'S HAPPENING AT A BREAKNECK SPEED I HAVE BEEN ON THE PHONE OVER THE LAST NUMBER OF WEEKS WITH PROBABLY MORE THAN A DOZEN. CONTRACTORS JUST SHE WAS LIKE HOW DOES IT WORK WHAT'S HAPPENING ASSIST USES PRACTICAL AND BY EVERY SINGLE ONE TO A PERSON WHO'S ACTUALLY ON THE GROUND DOING THIS WORK SAID FANTASTIC GREAT POLICY IT WILL BE VERY VERY IMPORTANT TO WITH THAT. I THANK YOU FOR THIS HARD WORK I THINK IT'S REALLY IMPORTANT AND VERY PRACTICAL AND NECESSARY. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS THE MAJORITY LEADER WE LIKE TO BE TO DO A LAST CALL FOR QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THIS COMMITTEE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE. WILL BE THE MOTION FOR BY CENTER WIENER A MAN FROM TIM THIS BILL IS SMART AND FOCUSED ON INFILL DEVELOPMENT LED BY HOMEOWNERS. AND I JUST WANNA. TAKE ONE LAST TIME TO SAY. CENTER WIENER NOSES SENT INSTANCES IT IS NOT EASY NOT EASY TO DO HOUSING LEGISLATION. AND THE REASON WHY WE'RE HERE TODAY LOOKING AT THIS BILL BY THE PRO TEM IS BECAUSE SHE'S A PERSON OVER WORD.

WHO GAVE US THE BAND WITH TO MOVE FURTHER IN AND CERTAINLY THE EIGHTY YOU BILL. AND BILLS BY NUMEROUS MEMBERS INCLUDING OUR OWN SENATOR WE CASKEY THOSE HAVE BEEN INCREDIBLE MOVEMENTS FORWARD AND I DON'T THINK WE WOULD BE HERE TODAY. WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF DOING. THIS BILL AND OTHER BILLS TO CALM WITHOUT THEIR INCREDIBLE WORK. IT TAKES A LOT OF WORK. I WANT TO THANK ALL THE SPEAKERS TODAY THE STAKEHOLDERS THAT WEIGHED IN FOR THEIR INPUT WE STILL WILL BE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES MISS RYAN I HEARD YOU I KNOW THAT WE'RE GOING TO BE. FOLLOWING UP. I COME OUT OF LOCAL GOVERNMENT I WAS A CITY COUNCIL MEMBER BEFORE THAT I WAS A STAFF MEMBER I'VE BEEN TO MORE COMMUNITY PLANNING COMMITTEES. HOUR UPON HOUR UPON HOUR I GREATLY RESPECT THAT PROCESS.

AND I'M PROUD OF THE WORK OF MY COLLEAGUES. THAT GOT US HERE TODAY. MY NAME MAYBE THE TOP NAME ON THE PIECE OF LEGISLATION BUT I'M PRETTY CLEAR.

ALRIGHT LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WE NOW WOULD LIKE TO BE A TO GO TO ITEM NUMBER THREE ITEM NUMBER THREE IS SB TEN FORTY NINE THIS IS FOCUSING. ON LOCAL ORDINANCES AND SHORT TERM RENTALS SENATOR GLACIER IS COMING TO US. LIVE FROM THE GREAT CITY OF ORINDA- AND WE DO HAVE CUED UP RIGHT NOW VICE MAYOR WORSE FROM THE CITY ARANDA TO TESTIFY. ON THE PHONE WITHOUT FURTHER ADO LET'S TURN IT OVER TO CENTER GLAZER ON SB TEN FORTY NINE SENATOR. I THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I WANT TO THANK YOU AND YOUR FULL COMMITTEE STAFF FOR THEIR WORK ON THIS BILL I'M- HAPPY TO. CHECK IT'S THAT ARE. ALICE'S OUT MEN AND SAYS TEN NINE BUT AUTHORIZES SAY OR CAL TO IMPOSE A FINE UP TO FIVE THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION OF A SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCE CURRENTLY SHORT TERM RENTAL SUCH AS AIRBNB HOMEAWAY B. R. B. L. HAVE BECOME INCREASINGLY POPULAR AIRBNB ALONG WITH SHORT TERM RENTALS IN EIGHTY ONE THOUSAND CITIES. UNDER NINETY ONE COUNTRIES SO SHORT TERM RENTALS OFFER A WAY TO IMPROVE TOURISM AND EARN OWNERS EXTRA MONEY THERE HAVE BEEN SOME BAD ACTORS AND THEY HAVE USE THAT PLATFORM HOST LARGE PARTIES LARGE GATHERINGS HAVE MADE SOME SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES THE SITE OF UNDER AGE DRINKING BRAWLS AND NOISE COMPLAINTS. AND MOST TRAGICALLY LAST YEAR. IT HOMETOWN OF ORINDA AT A PARTY YEAH AIRBNB RENTAL FIVE PEOPLE WERE KILLED. NOW THE PROBLEM IS THAT MANY OF THESE HOMES GET RANCID FOR HUGE PRICE TAGS THOUSAND A NIGHT TWO THOUSAND THREE THOUSAND A NIGHT. AND IN THESE INSTANCES. A FINE OF UP TO A THOUSAND DOLLARS PER VIOLATION IS NOT ENOUGH IN MY OPINION TO DO TO DETER BAD ACTORS I'M TRYING TO MAKE A QUICK PROFIT. THIS BILL WILL GIVE TOOLS TO CITIES AND COUNTIES- THAT CAN DETER PEOPLE FROM TAKING ADVANTAGE OF SHORT TERM RENTALS TO HOST DESTRUCTIVE AN UNSAFE. HOUSE PARTIES I THIS IS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL THAT I THINK THE CITIES AND COUNTIES WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A PLEASE THAT WE HAVE SUPPORT FROM. MANY THOSE ENTITIES FOR THIS LEGISLATION AND WHAT BETTER RESPECTFULLY ASTRONOMICAL. THANK YOU SO MUCH SENATOR GLACIER WE'RE GRATEFUL FOR YOUR TESTIMONY LEADERSHIP ON THIS IMPORTANT ISSUE LADIES AND GENTLEMEN COMMITTEE WE'D LIKE TO BETTER START WITH TESTIMONY TESTIMONY ON THE PHONE. BUT WE DO HAVE ANY WORSE THE VICE MAYOR FROM THE CITY OF ORINDA ON THE LINE. THAT INVITES MARY WE WELCOME YOU TO COMMITTEE YOU HAVE THREE MINUTES WE'LL GIVE YOU A THIRTY SECOND PROMPT. MADAM VICE MAYOR OF THE FLOOR IS YOURS THREE MINUTES. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR DEAR CHAIR MCGUIRE AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE- I'M AT WORDS VICE MAYOR VERANDA AND I WANT TO THANK. TARA REID WE'RE GOING TO CHECK IN WITH OUR TELECONFERENCE FOR WRITER THIS GIVE US A QUICK MOMENT. OKAY GREAT- YOUR BACK OKAY THEN NICE MAYORS BACK MINIMIZE MAYOR WE LOST YOU. THERE FOR ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS AMENDED VICE MAYOR IF YOU WOULDN'T MIND WE APOLOGIZE WOULD YOU MIND STARTING YOUR STATEMENT OVER WE LOST IT FOR ABOUT TWENTY SECONDS. SENATOR I'D BE VERY THANK YOU VERY MUCH. DEAR DEAR MCGUIRE MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I'M AMY WORDS VICE MAYOR VERANDA AND I WANT TO THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK TODAY IN SUPPORT OF SENATE BILL CAN FORTY NINE THIS BILL WILL PROVIDE CITIES WITH AN IMPORTANT TOOL IN MANAGING SHORT TERM RENTALS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES AND WE ARE VERY GRATEFUL TO SENATOR GLAZERS. FOR SPONSORING THIS LEGISLATION. YOU WILL RECALL THE TRAGIC MURDERS ON HALLOWEEN NIGHT IN A READ THAT THAT OCCURRED AND ILLEGAL GATHERING AT A SHORT TERM RENTAL. THIS UNSPEAKABLE TRAGEDY WITH DEVASTATING TO THE FAMILIES OF THE VICTIMS AND TO OUR COMMUNITY. WHEN HORT TERM RENTAL HOUSING PLATFORMS CAME INTO EXISTENCE MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA CHOSE TO PAY ON THEM COMPLETELY SH IN A WRITTEN A WE CHOSE A MORE MODERN APPROACH TO PERMIT. AND A DOCTOR AN ORDINANCE CLEARLY OUTLINED THE RULES. THAT INCLUDED NO RENTALS FOR LARGE PARTIES AND THE REQUIREMENT THAT SHORT TERM RENTALS REGISTER THEIR PROPERTY. SHOULD BE ADOPTION OF OUR ORDINANCE STAFF HAS WORKED WITH PROPERTY OWNERS AND NEIGHBORS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS AND COMPLAINTS. THIS REQUIRES EXTENSIVE STAFF RESOURCES BUT IT ALSO REQUIRES THE ADMINISTRATIVE TOOLS TO DO EFFECTIVE ENFORCEMENT. FOLLOWING THE HALLOWEEN TRAGEDY WE FURTHER STRENGTHEN OUR ORDINANCE TO RESTRICT RENTALS TO HOSTED RENTALS WITH TWO NIGHT MINIMUM. HOWEVER THE GREATEST CHALLENGE THAT WE FACE IS THE ABILITY TO ENFORCE THE RULES IN THE FACE OF SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. THE COMPLIANCE SHORT TERM RENTAL PROPERTIES WITH LOCAL ZONING ORDINANCES IS THE RESPONSIBILITY OF BOTH. THE PROPERTY OWNER AND THE SHORT TERM RENTAL PLATFORMS. HAVING AN ADEQUATE FINE STRUCTURE IS THE ONLY WAY WE WILL BE ABLE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE AND ENFORCE. THESE REASONABLE OREGON SAYS. I RENDER LIKE MANY CITIES IN CALIFORNIA IS THE GENERAL LAW CITY AND THE STATE LEGISLATURE SETS THE STATUTORY LIMIT FOR FIVE. THIS BILL WOULD PROVIDE A MUCH NEEDED TOOL FOR CITIES IN CALIFORNIA TO ENFORCE THEIR SHORT TERM RENTAL ORDINANCES. AND AGAIN I APPRECIATE THE COMMITTEES- CONSIDERATION OF OUR TESTIMONY AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT OF THIS IMPORTANT SHORT TERM RENTAL BILL AND THANK YOU VERY MUCH.

SB NINE SEVENTY TWO GOOD MORNING MA'AM IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS AND- I WILL BE ACCEPTING THE AMENDMENTS THAT ARE OUTLINED IN THE ANALYSIS. AND ALL OPEN READ IT SB NINE SEVEN TWO WILL ALIGN CALIFORNIA WHICH STATES LIKE FLORIDA INDIANA MINNESOTA MISSISSIPPI NEBRASKA OKLAHOMA IN SOME SEVEN OTHERS THAT REQUIRED DISCLOSURE. BY LARGE CORPORATIONS OF THE STATE TAX CREDITS TAKEN BY THOSE ENTITIES AND THE AMOUNT OF STATE TAXES PAID THIS PUBLICLY AVAILABLE INFORMATION GIVES THE POLICYMAKERS AND THE PUBLIC ACCESS TO DATA. ON THEIR TAX POLICIES THAT ALLOWS THEM TO EVALUATE TAX POLICY. CALIFORNIA POLICY MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC DO NOT HAVE ACCESS TO THIS DATA SO WHILE WE CAN GET. FROM OUR- F. T. B. WERE CONTROLLERS OFFICE THE TOTAL FOR EXAMPLE OF REVENUE THAT WE RECEIVE SKEWS ME MY MASK KEEPS FALLING OFF MY NOSE. THE TOTAL REVENUE THAT WE RECEIVE SAY FROM CORPORATE INCOME TAXES WHICH ARE I WILL POINT OUT I'M DIVERTING A LITTLE BIT BUT- BY TODAY. CORPORATE INCOME TAX ONLY REFLECTS. 9% OF OUR TOTAL GENERAL FUND REVENUES IN THE PAST IT WAS UP 217% AND SO THIS IS AT A TIME WHEN CLARA CALIFORNIA IS CRITICIZED FOR HER FOR HAVING VERY VOLATILE% CELL STATE REVENUES AND BEING RELIANCE PRIMARILY ON INDIVIDUAL INCOME TAX AND YET OUR REVENUE IN TOTAL FROM CORPORATE TAXES IS A VERY LOW PERCENT OF OUR GENERAL FUND. AND WE CAN'T EVEN ANALYZE WHETHER THOSE CORPORATIONS WHICH TODAY ARE. FIVE MAYBE NOT EXACTLY TODAY BUT IN GENERAL RECORDING RECORD PROFITS WHAT THEY ARE PROVIDING TO US AND SO WHEN WE DEBATE TAX POLCY. WE HAVE VERY LITTLE INFORMATION TO REALLY INFORM ANY TYPES OF DECISIONS NOW OPTIMALLY I THINK SUCH A DATABASE THAT SB NINE SEVEN TWO IS ESTABLISHING SHOULD INCLUDE. THE DATA ON THE INDIVIDUAL TAX BREAKS IN OTHER WORDS DOESCORPORATE TAX TAKE WATERS IT DOES IT TAKE YOU KNOW WHAT THE WHOLE VARIETY OF THEM AND WE HAVE MANY MANY MANY MANY MANY. BUT NO THIS IS A VERY SIMPLE DATABASE IT IS PURELY THOSE CORPORATIONS WITH GROCERY BEATS FIVE BILLION OR MORE. WHO WOULD INFORM US OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF STATE TAXES PAID AND THE TOTAL AMOUNT THE VALUE OF STATE TAX CREDITS. EVENTUALLY WE SHOULD HAVE MORE DATA BUT GIVEN. THE TYPE OF. GIVEN TAT WE ARE OUR REVENUES ARE DOWN WE DO NOT WANT TO ADD A LOT OF COST TO OUR DEPARTMENTS IN TRYING TO GATHER SUCH DATA OR SYMBOL SUCH A DATABASE. SO I WENT WITH THE SIMPLEST. INITIALLY NOW JUST AS CONTRAST I GIVE YOU SOME STATE INFORMATION FEDERALLY ALL PUBLICLY TRADED CORPORATIONS NO NOTE I SAID THAT THIS BILL COVERS. CORPORATIONS WITH GROSS RECEIPTS OF FIVE BILLION OR MORE IT IS NOT BLUE IT IS NOT LIMITED TO PUBLICLY TRADED HOW EVER. THE MATURITY AND I MEAN THE VAST MAJORITY OVER 95% OF THE CORPORATIONS THAT WOULD FALL UNDER THIS FIVE BILLION OR HIGHER GROSS RECEIPTS ARE PUBLICLY TRADED THERE ARE VERY FEW COURT. NOW MY CONTRAST IS THAT THERE'S NATIONAL LEGISLATION THAT REQUIRES ALL PUBLICLY TRADED CORP COMPANIES REGARDLESS OF SIZE. TO DISCLOSE TO THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE COMMISSION THE AMOUNT OF FEDERAL TO THE PAY THE TAX DEDUCTIONS TAKEN THEIR CEO PAY THEIR EMPLOYEE MEETING MEDIAN EMPLOYEE PAY AND THAT'S A RATHER INFO.

THIS BILL IS AN ATTEMPT TO SHANE TAXPAYERS TO RECEIVE BUSINESS TAX CREDITS AND TO BE FRANK WE ARE SURPRISED AT THIS BILL RIGHT IS THE LEVEL CORD IT'S WITH THIS BODY SPENT TIME. DEBATE GIVEN OFFICE GOING ON THE WORLD. THE BILL REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO PRODUCE AND REPORT ON CORPORATE TAXPAYERS TO INCLUDE SUCH COMPANY INFORMATION AS OUR NAME. TAX LIABILITY HELLO BUT YOUR SEATS MOUNT CREDITS CLAIM FOR THE TAXABLE YEAR. THIS BILL SUBJECTIVELY TARGETS TAXPAYERS RB. GROSS RECEIPTS THRESHOLD. AND SINGLE NEEDS BUSINESS OUT TO HAVE BEEN CONFIDENCE TAX AND- CHEN THE POP. THERE'S NO CAN. BE GROSS. AND TAX CREDITS ADDITIONALLY GROSS RECEIPTS ARE NOT INCOME. THIS BILL REQUIRES THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD TO VIOLATE SEVERAL THEY'RE LISTED PRINCIPLES A PROTECTION PROTECTING TAX. INFORMATION PRIVACY. THE TAXPAYER BILL OF RIGHTS WHICH THE CALIFORNIA LEGISLATURE PASSED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT. THE BILL ADDITIONALLY REQUIRES A REPORT ON HOW MANY CREDITS ARE CLEAN FOR EACH TXABLE YEAR. THESE CREDITS ARE CLAIMED LEGALLY BY TAXPAYERS AND BETTER BY CALIFORNIA'S. TAX AGENCIES TO ENSURE TAXPAYER DOLLARS ARE BEING USED AND TEN PURPOSE. ACT MISUSES ACOSTA HELP TAX AGENCY LEGAL TO ENSURE ALL. THERE SHARE. YEAH IF YOU CAN PRODUCE AGGREGATE DATA AS LONG AS NO INFORMATION TO BE USED TO IDENTIFY TAX THERE WHICH IS ENOUGH TO INFORM POLICY DECISIONS. BY INCLUDING COMPANY NAMES ONE CAN ONLY ASSUME THIS IS BEING USED TO HAME COMPANIES. BY SHAMING TAXPAYERS YOU LIE TAX CREDITS CALIFORNIA WILL BE SENDING MESSAGES TO BUSINESSES. DO NOT YOU DO NOT UTILIZE CREDITS IN THE STATE DO NOT DO BUSINESS HERE. THERE'S A TIME AND PLACE FOR TAX CREDIT AND IN TIMES SUCH AS BEST WHEN CALIFORNIA'S UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE CLAIMS THAT SHATTERED PRIOR RECORDS. EDIT CAN BE A POWERFUL TO THE MOTOR BECAME. THIS STATE COMPANY. TO UTILIZE HIRING CREDIT. THE WORLD NEEDS CALIFORNIA COMPANIES USE UTILIZE RESEARCHING THE VELVET CREDIT.

GOOD MORNING MR CARE CAN YOU HEAR ME YES MA'AM GOOD MORNING YOU ARE NOW LIVE IN COMMITTEE YOU ARE THREE MINUTES THE FLOOR IS YOURS NIKKI. I THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE. FOR THE RECORD MY NAME IS NIKKI OBEY TESTIFYING TODAY ON THE HAVE IN THE COUNT CORN STATE TAXATION. IN OPPOSITION SB NINE SEVENTY TWO- BECOME FAULTY TAXATION OF THE NONPROFIT TRADE ASSOCIATION. WE HAVE A POTENTIALLY FIVE HUNDRED FIFTY MEMBERS- INTERSTATE AND INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS. OUR MISSION IS TO PROMOTE AND PRESERVE THE EQUITABLE AND NON DISCRIMINATORY STATE AND LOCAL TAXATION. OF MULTI JURISDICTIONAL BUSINESS SAYS. I'M WE STAND UNITED WITH CAL TAX IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL BECAUSE FRANKLY WE THINK IT. BAD TAX POLICY FIRST AND FOREMOST WE BELIEVE THAT THIS BILL DOES IN FACT VIOLATE FEDERAL LAW SPECIFICALLY I ARE THE SECTION SIXTY ONE. ZERO THREE WHICH PROHIBITS EIGHT FROM DISCLOSING ANY RETURN OR RETURN INFORMATION. I WOULD ADVISE THE COMMITTEE THAT RETURN INFORMATION WITHIN THE PROVISION IS BROADLY DEFINED TO INCLUDE PACKED THEIR IDENTITY AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF INCOME. AND BECAUSE THE BE- CALIFORNIA A CORPORATE ECONOMY. TAX IS BASED ON FEDERAL CORPORATE FEDERAL INCOME I WOULD CAUTION THE COMMITTEE THAT THIS VERY WELL COULD VIOLATE HIS PROVISION OF FEDERAL CODES- WHICH WOULD PUT AT RISK THE FTV THE ABILITY TO OBTAIN INFORMATION FROM THE IRAQ- CONSIDERING BACKING GRAVE LEGAL REST I WOULD ASK THIS COMMITTEE WHY WHY WOULD YOU GO SO FAR AS TO. ESSENTIALLY PRECLUDE THE F. T. V. FROM INFORMATION SHARING- WITH THE IRAQ FOR. SIMPLY THE PURPOSE OF I WOULD TAKE PUBLICLY SHAMING CORPORATION- SENSE OF THE INFORMATION IS AVAILABLE ON AN AGGREGATE BASIS THAT- THE COMMITTEE DEFINITELY COULD WORK WITH THE F. T. B. ON OBTAINING INFORMATION IN AN AGGREGATE MANNER WITH RESPECT TO THE PACIFIC INDUSTRIES IF THERE WERE CONCERNED. ABOUT THE TICKET CREDIT AND HOW THOSE WOULD BE YEARS YOU SIMPLY DO NOT NEED SPECIFIC TAX INFORMATION TO MAKE POLICY DECISIONS I'M THE ONLY OTHER REASON THAT WE CAN THINK THAT THE AGGREGATE INFORMATION ISN'T SUFFICIENT FOR POLICY MAKERS AND WE BY NO MEANS BELIEVE THAT THERE IS- ANY TRUTH TO THAT. IS THAT THERE'S SOMETHING THE COMMITTEE ISN'T TALKING ABOUT WHAT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD OF DEALING WITH THE FACT TO TAXPAYERS AGAIN WE ARE BY NO MEANS SAYING THAT THAT IS THE CASE- BUT THAT WOULD BE THE ONLY REASON THAT YOU WOULD NEED TO ATTACK TAX. INFORMATION AS WELL. FINALLY I WOULD. THIRTY SECONDS. I'M I KNOW I WOULD JUST MAKE ONE WITH THE TOOK MADE EARLIER REGARDING THE LEVEL OF CORPORATE INCOME TAXES GOING DOWN- THIS BILL ALSO DOES NOT. HOW ANY OF THE OTHER TAX WILL BE PAID BY CORPORATIONS INCLUDING PROPERTY TAX AND SALES AND USE TAX SO THEREFORE WE- STRONGLY OPPOSE THE BILL AND URGE I KNOW ABOUT.

I'M SORRY WE ALREADY DID THAT WE'RE BACK T COMMITTEE MY GOODNESS WE'RE GOING TO TURN IT OVER TO BOTH ASSN WINNER IN THE MAJORITY LEADER PLEASE. THANK YOU FIFTY THANK YOU- MISTER CHAIRMAN- I SUPPORT THIS BILL I DO WANNA THANK THE- AUTHOR FOR HER PERSISTENCE IN ADDRESSING SOME OF THE REAL. INEQUITIES WE HAVE AROUND CORPORATE TAXATION. IN THIS STATE I DO WANT TO SPECIFICALLY ADDRESS- TE LEAD WITNESS HAD. MADE A POINT OF WHY ARE WE CONSIDERING THIS NOW DURING THE PANDEMIC AND THIS DOESN'T SEEM TO RISE TO THE LEVEL I ACTUALLY THINK. IT DOES AND I THINK IT ACTUALLY IS TIED. TO OR EXPERIENCE NOW WHAT COVE IN NINETEEN. HAS DONE IN MANY WAYS IT'S CAST A SPOTLIGHT VERY BRIGHT SPOTLIGHT ON SOME OF THE REAL- INEQUITIES AND PROBLEMS AND DEFICIENCIES. IN OUR SOCIETY AND OUR APPROACH TO GOVERNANCE. NOT EVERYONE HAD REALLY FOCUSED ON BEFORE A NUMBER OF US DID. NOT EVERYONE- AND ONE OF THOSE DEFICIENCIES. IS THE COME THE COMPLETE INADEQUACY OF OUR SOCIAL SAFETY NET. IN CALIFORNIA AND NATIONALLY IN A LOT OF PEOPLE ARE EXPERIENCING THAT LACK OF A SAFETY NET NOW FOR THE FIRST TIME. BECAUSE A MORE SECURE BEFORE THEY'RE NOT NOW AND THEN REALIZING ALL MY GOD- THERE'S- A LIKE WHAT DOES NOTHING TO PREVENT. OR NOT ENOUGH TO PREVENT PEOPLE FROM FREE FALLING. AT ONE OF THE REASONS. UP FOR THE LACK OF AN ADEQUATE SAFETY NET IS BECAUSE WE HAVE AN INADEQUATE TAX SYSTEM THAT DOESN'T ARTICLE ADEQUATELY TAX. RICH CORPORATIONS BUT DOESN'T ADEQUATELY TAX WEALTH. AND WHEN WE LOOK AT CORPORATE TAXATION WE KNOW. BECAUSE SOMETIMES INFORMATION GETS OUT THAT SOME OF THE LARGEST CORPORATIONS IN THE WORLD. PAY LITTLE OR NO. FIVE CORPORATE INCOME TAX. HI BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE SYSTEMATIC DATA WHICH I THINK IT WILL SHOW SOME VERY VERY INTERESTING RESULTS AND MAY ACTUALLY BE INSTRUCTIVE AND HELPFUL IN TRYING TO HAVE A MORE EQUITABLE SYSTEM OF TAXATION OF FOR CORPORATIONS FOR THE THOUGHT ACCEPTABLE. WHEN YOU KNOW CORPORATION LIKE IT'S AN AMAZON OR SOMETHING ELSE IS PAYING SUCH A LITTLE. IN INCOME TAX. SO WE LOOK AT IT RESPONDING TO COVER NINETEEN. WE NEED TO LOOK AT OUR TAX SYSTEM WE NEED TO LOOK AT TAXATION. AND THIS VERY BASIC DATA IS NOT A VIOLATION OF PRIVACY THIS IS ABOUT. HOW MUCH TAX YOU PAYING AND HOW MAY TAX EXEMPTIONS ARE YOU GETTING VERY VERY BASIC INFORMATION- AND I SUPPORT THIS BILL AND I MOVED BILL. THANK YOU SO MUCH IS CENTER WIENER WE DO HAVE A MOTION ON THE FLOOR WE THREE INDIVIDUALS WHO WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK FROM THE COMMITTEE WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE MINORITY LEADER THAN WE'RE GONNA GO TO THE VICE CHAIR THAN CENTER HER TITLE MISS MAJORITY LEADER THE FLOORS ARE SIR. AS A LISTEN TO THIS DEBATE. THERE'S ASSUMPTIONS ARE BEING MADE. I THINK A WRONG. THE REALITY IS THAT THERE ARE SOME TAX CREDITS ARE GOOD. THAT WE CAN USE TAX POLICY IN THE WAY THAT SUPPORTS IMPORTANT PUBLIC POLICY. THE QUESTION HERE IS A MANAGEMENT QUESTION. ANY CFO OR COO OF ANY COMPANY THAT'S RUNNING A COMPANY. LOOKS AT THEIR VARIOUS INDICATORS AND TRIES TO DETERMINE WHAT'S WORKING WHAT'S NOT WORKING. I SERVED IN A CONFERENCE COMMITTEE WITH WALLY KNOX AND DIANE WATSON SOME TWENTY YEARS SOME YEARS AGO ON DEALING WITH THIS VERY ISSUE AND ONE OF THE GREAT CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE. IS AT AS WE COME IN THESE JOBS. PEOPLE WALKING OR OFFICE THEY TELL US- DO THIS THIS IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO DO. COMMON IN THIS OF SAY THE PROBLEM AND I ALWAYS SAY TO A ONE OF A DOZEN YOU GONNA PAY US BACK. RIGHT YOU BOUGHT A CAR DIDN'T HAVE ENGINE WELL GIVE US THE MONEY BACK ITS BASIC POLICY YOU GUYS WANT US TO. SPEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF TAXPAYERS MONEY GOING TO PAY US BACK. WE CAN'T OBVIOUSLY. AND SO FROM A MANAGEMENT PERSPECTIVE WHAT YOU NEED OUR TOOLS AVAILABLE. TO DO THAT DIAGNOSTIC. AND WHAT I FOUND IN EVERY TIME I TRY TO ENGAGE IN ASKING THE APPROPRIATE QUESTIONS DETERMINE WHETHER SOMETHING IS WORKING OR NOT WORKING YOU GET THE KABUKI YOU GET THE CHANCE TO GET THE WELL I CAN'T GIVE THE INFORMATION OR LOOK AT THIS INDUSTRY AND WILL WE WEREN'T PART OF THAT INDUSTRY IN THIS IS NOT THE REASON. AND YOU DON'T GET TO IT. WE COMBINE I GET THE ISSUE OF THE SHAMING PART I THINK IT'S AN INTERESTING OBSERVATION. BUT THE REALITY IS WE ARE TRYING TO RUN A GOVERNMENT THAT. CREATES THE RIGHT INCENTIVES TO CHOOSE THE RIGHT OUTCOMES. AND IF THEY'RE NOT TO CORRECT IT. AND SO WHY SUPPORT THIS BILL IS BECAUSE I THINK IT'S GOOD MANAGEMENT. I THINK THAT THE ARGUMENTS THAT ARE BEING MADE AGAINST IT. ARE THE SAME KIND OF ARGUMENTS ARE BEING MADE AGAINST SOME OF THE OTHER BILLS THAT IT'S BASICALLY ABOUT WILL WE DON'T WANT TO DO THIS AND WE WANT TO GET WE WANT TO GET. AND WE HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY IN GOVERNMENT TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS. AND IT SEEMS TO ME THAT ANY COMPANY THAT WOULD HAVE. A BUNCH OF TAX CREDITS SECOND ISSUE STATEMENTS VACANCY YOU CAN JUSTIFY WHAT THEY'RE DOING THEY'LL COME BEFORE HERE'S WITH AN EXAM UP ISSUES. TERM WHETHER WILL WRITE WHAT THE WILL WRONG. BUT WHAT WE'RE ENGAGE IN THIS BIG DEBTS. AND YOU KNOW THAT'S NO SURPRISE SEE OF WHICH- SPENT A GREAT DEAL OF TIME. EITHER IN THE BENEFIT OF FISH. THIS POLICY WERE GOVERNMENT SAYS WE'RE GONNA GIVE YOU THIS THIS BENEFIT AND YOU SHOULD HAVE AN OBLIGATION TO JUSTIFY TAKING THAT BENEFIT. SO I AM LISTENED CLOSELY TO THE ARGUMENTS IN OPPOSITION. AND I JUST THINK THE- I THINK THEY COMPORT TO BASIC. PRINCIPLES I DON'T THINK THAT THEY SHOULD BE VIEWED IN THE ISSUE OF LABOR VERSUS MANAGEMENT. THIS IS OUR JOB AS PUBLIC OFFICIALS. THAT PROPERLY- A STEWARDS OF TAXPAYER DOLLARS. AND TO BASICALLY MAKE SURE WE HAVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES TO ENSURE THE POLICIES THAT WE ENGAGE IN. ARE CHEATING THE OUTCOMES THAT THEY'RE ACHIEVING AND THIS WILL ALLOW US TO ENGAGE A SPECIFIC CONVERSATIONS. TO GET TO THAT GOAL SO I THINK IT'S VERY THOUGHTFUL. A AND I DON'T THINK THE CHARACTERS A AS TO HOW IT'S BEEN LAID OUT IS ACCURATE. AND I THINK IT'S GOOD MANAGEMENT THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND THAT'S ONE WITH A VOTE FOR THIS BILL TODAY. THANK YOU SO MUCH MISTER MAJORITY LEADER MEMBERS THE COMMITTEE WOULD LIKE TO TURN ON THE VICE CHAIR THAN SOONER HER TITLE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND MAYBE I'LL PICK UP OR SENATOR HERTZBERG LEFT OFF I. I THINK HE MAKES SOME VERY STRONG. POINTS BUT I DON'T THINK THE ISSUE IS THAT WE DON'T TAX ENOUGH. WHAT'S WHAT'S INTERESTING IS THIS BODY KEEPS APPROVING TAX CREDITS. AND IT DOESN'T ANALYZE. WHAT THEY DO. BUT IT'S AN INDICTMENT IT'S AN INDICTMENT OF THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD IT'S AN INDICTMENT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE THAT WE DON'T EVEN KNOW WHAT OUR REVENUES ARE AND WHAT ARE. TAX EXPENDITURES ARE. AND SO NOW WE'RE SAMPLING. WITH A GROUP OF CORPORATE CITIZENS THAT EARN A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF TOTAL REVENUES AND I THINK IT'S BAD MANAGEMENT I AGREE WITH THE SENATOR FROM HELL TAKE WITH. IT'S FRUSTRATING TO ME AS SOMEONE WHO IS AN EXECUTIVE WHO IS SOMEONE WHO RAN. BUSINESS AND APARTMENTS IN A COUNTY THAT WE DON'T HAVE THE DATA IMAGE IS MIND BOGGLING THIS IS THE SECOND BILL OF THIS NATURE WE'VE HAD IN THIS COMMITTEE THIS YEAR SO FAR. MISTER CHAIR SO. IT'S A LOAN BURSTING TO ME WE FILED ELECTRONICALLY. WE HAVE THE DATA ELECTRONICALLY WE HAVE A GOVERNOR WHO'S JUST INTO DIGITAL. INNOVATION WHICH THE CLAIMS THAT HE SENT TO DIGITAL INNOVATION. ALTHOUGH HE VETOED A BILL ON ADOPTING XP ARE HEALTH WHICH IS WHAT EVEN CHINESE COMPANIES USED TO MANAGE THEIR CAMPUS I JUST AND WE SET UP WHEN WE APPROVE FORTY MILLION DOLLARS FOR DIGITAL INNOVATIONS SO. YOU COULD TELL THAT DEPARTMENT TAKE MINE THE DATA AT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND YOU WOULD PROBABLY PAY FOR ITSELF. AND MAYBE AS A FRUSTRATED LEGISLATOR MISTER CHAIR THIS IS. MAY TWENTY EIGHTH AND WE STILL DON'T HAVE OUR- COMPREHENSIVE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT FOR JUNE THIRTY. TWENTY NINETEEN- BOOK WHERE IS THE DIGITAL INNOVATION WHERE WHAT WHAT DO WE NEED BILLS LIKE THIS WHY CAN'T THIS STATE RUN LIKE A LIKE LIKE MAYBE IT HAS SILICON VALLEY INSIDE ITS BORDERS WITH. SALT THANK YOU FOR LETTING ME VENT A LITTLE BIT MISTER CHAIRMAN- I'M JUST I'M JUST AMAZED THAT WE WERE LOOKING FOR JUST A LITTLE BIT OF INFORMATION FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD. AND TWO WITNESSES A SAID YOU CAN GET THAT NOW I CAN GET AND SO I GUESS MY FIRST QUESTION TO THE GOOD SENATOR SKINNER WOULD BE HAVE YOU ASKED FOR THAT INFORMATION FROM THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD HAVE YOU REQUESTED THE AGGREGATE DATA JUST TO SEE. WHAT THE GROSS REVENUES ARE FOR THIS THIS STRATIFIED SEGMENT OF THE- TAX. CORPORATE TAXPAYERS IN. WHAT WE CAN AND THEN WHAT WHAT ARE THE PERCENTAGES OF CREDITS ARE GETTING. SENATOR THROUGH THE CHAIR THESE- SENDER BY VICE CHAIR I APPRECIATE. SKIS ME THE QUESTION AND- ARE HEY PRECIADO ALSO YOUR ELIMINATING THE ISSUE HERE IS NOT THAT THE F. TV DOES NOT HAVE THE STATE THE F. T. B. X. FIVE RECEIVES THE- TAX FILINGS OF THESE ENTITIES. IT IS THAT IT CAN WE CANNOT HAVE ACCESS TO IT YES THE F. T. B. CAN'T GIVE IT TO US IN AGGREGATE AND WE GET IT AN ACTOR AGGREGATE HOWEVER THAT DOES NOT ASSIST US IN THE DAY. DO NOT IT IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR US FOR EXAMPLE TO GET. THE INFORMATION ABOUT. THE TOTAL VALUE OF TAX FOR NOT VALUE THE TOTAL. PAYOUTS BECAUSE ANY TAX CREDIT IS A TAX EXPENDITURE RIGHT WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE SPEND ON K. THROUGH TWELVE SCHOOLS WE KNOW EXACTLY WHAT WE SPEND ON MEDI CAL WE KNOW EXACTLY YOU KNOW ON AND ON I CAN GIVE THIS WHOLE LIST BUT EACH INDIVIDUAL TAX CREDIT WE HAVE MUCH LESS VERY SPECIFIC BECAUSE WE DON'T ALLOW IT PUBLICLY. NOW THIS BILL DOES NOT EVEN GO THAT FAR IT PURELY GIVES US THE INFORMATION OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF TAX CREDIT A PARTICULAR ENTITY. I AM NOT TALKING A CORPORATION WITH GROSS RECEIPTS OF FIVE BILLION OR MORE NOW THE OTHER THING I DIDN'T MENTION THIS ONLY COVERS FOUR TO FIVE POINT FOUR HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES AND THESE COMPANIES DO NOT HAVE TO BE CALIFORNIA HEADQUARTERS. THERE ACROSS THE US SO I FOUND IT VERY INTERESTING TO HEAR THE OPPOSITION TALK ABOUT INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYERS THIS IS NOT AFFECT WHAT YOU AND I USUALLY THINK OF AS AN INDIVIDUAL TAXPAYER ANY VICE CITY ON THE DICE IT ONLY AFFECTS FOUR HUNDRED TO FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES CORPORATIONS ACROSS THE US. THAT IN CALIFORNIA HAVE GROSS RECEIPTS OF FIVE BILLION OR MORE. IN MY PURPOSE IS NOT TO SHAME BUT THAT YOU DIDN'T ASK THAT SO ANYWAY YES I CAN GET YOU CAN'T I CAN'T. THAT AGGREGATE DATA WHICH IS WHY WE KNOW FOR EXAMPLE. THAT CORPORATE INCOME TAX REVENUE TO THE STATE IS RIGHT TODAY ONLY ABOUT- AS OF LAST YEAR ABOUT 9% OF OUR COMPLETE GENERAL FUND- BUT WE DON'T HAVE ANY INDIVIDUAL DATA. BECAUSE WE BECAUSE OUR LAW PREVENTS IT HOWEVER ALL THE OTHER STATES THAT I MENTIONED IN MY OPENING THEY ALLOW IT. WE APPROVED IN NINETEEN EIGHTY EIGHT THE TAXPAYERS BILL OF RIGHTS WITH THIS. BILL NULLIFY THAT BILL IS NOT NOTIFY THE ENTIRE LOT BY ANY MEANS IT PURELY ENABLES THE F. T. B. TO PROVIDE US WITH THE TWO DATA POINTS THAT WAS REITERATED BY. ONE OF THE- ARE- SEIU REPRESENTATIVE A PURELY GIVES US INFORMATION ON TWO DATA POINTS FOR THOSE FOUR HUNDRED FIVE HUNDRED COMPANIES WITH GROSS RECEIPTS OF FIVE BILLION OR MORE. AND IT WAS STATED THAT IT VIOLATES INTERVIEW CODE SECTION SIXTY FIVE. TO SIXTY SIXTY ONE OH THREE IS THAT ACCURATE. THAT IS NOT MY UNDERSTANDING IT IS CERTAINLY WAS NOT SOMETHING THE ANALYSIS- IF IT WAS- THERE WAS A VERY THOROUGH ANALYSIS AND- THAT IS NOT AN ELEMENT THAT WAS INCLUDED. SERVICE CAN BY THE OPPOSITION I'M I'M JUST. I'M JUST HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH THIS AND THIS APPROACH AND IT JUST SEEMS TO ME THAT WE SHOULD HAVE THIS DATA ALTHOUGH YOU I BELIEVE IN PRIVACY SO I'M I'M HAVING A TOUGH TIME EVEN THOUGH YOU'RE ASKING FOR VERY SPARSE INFORMATION AYE- BUT IT SEEMS TO ME THAT THE FRANCHISE TAX FOR SHOULD BE HELPING US OUT. AND THERE SHOULD BE LIKE A REGULAR DRILL OF WHAT IS THIS CREDIT DOING WITH IT IS IT DOING WHAT IT WAS DESIGNED AND IT'S A LITTLE EMBARRASSING TO ME THAT WE HAVE TO DO A BILL TO TELL THEM TO YOU THAT'S WHY I APPLAUD YOU FOR DOING THAT I AGREE WITH. WE GOT A WE GOT A PROD SOMEONE TO START MANAGING WHAT WE'RE DOING- BECAUSE I THINK THE TAX SYSTEM. COULD HAVE A LOT OF CHANGES BUT- BUT TED TED TO NIBBLE AROUND THE EDGES- IN THIS WAY. I'M HAVING DIFFICULTY WITH IT SO I WILL BE OPPOSED. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR TENNIS CAN WOULD YOU LIKE TO ANSWER THAT AND WE'RE GOING TO SONORA THROUGH THE CHAIR. THE PROBLEM IS IT'S NOT SO MUCH ME WEEK. WHETHER F. T. B. HAS THOSE CAPABILITIES OR NOT OF COURSE WE'D HAVE TO TEST THE ISSUE IS. OUR OWN STATUTES FOR BID THEM FROM GIVING US THAT DATA SO IF YOU RECALL WHEN WE EXTENDED THE FILM TAX CREDIT NOW I BELIEVE THAT WAS IN A SEVENTEEN. YET WHEN WE EXTEND THE FILM TAX CREDIT. WE REQUIRED. THE EVERYONE WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF IT TO DISCLOSE CERTAIN AMOUNT OF INFORMATION HOW MANY JOBS TO CREATE A WHOLE VARIETY OF THINGS. BECAUSE IN THE BECAUSE OUR TAX LAW WOULD NOT. PROHIBIT US FROM GETTING THAT INFORMATION SO IN A WAY WE HAVE CREATED THE BARRIER. OKAY BECAUSE WE WANT TO GET THE CENTER TUNNEL PLEASE RAISE YOUR STRUCTURE AND- THIS YEAR'S REALLY DIFFICULT- BUT MAYBE WE OUGHT TO HAVE A HEARING. ON THIS TOPIC MERITS ARE TALKING ABOUT OUR TAX SYSTEM CORPORATE INDIVIDUAL AT A CERTAIN. REVIEWING WHAT WHAT IT IS WHAT IT HOW IT COMPARES TO OTHERS IN WHERE WE CAN IMPROVE IT. AT AND THAT'S JUST MY RECOMMENDATION STRUCTURE FOR SHE TEMAS VICE CHAIR I THINK IT IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO KNOW THAT THERE IS A BILL BY SENATOR JACKSON THAT WAS ADVANCED. LAST WEEK THAT DID A DOES A FULL EVALUATION REGARDS THIS TAX CREDITS THAT WAS PASSED BY THE MAJORITY THIS COMMITTEE THAT. DOES A DEEP DIVE ON THE EVALUATION CRATES COMMITTEE TO BE A LOOK AT THE CREDITS. AND EFFICACY OF THOSE SAID THAT IT WAS RETURNED LAST YEAR- BUT AND THIS COMMITTEE DID PASS IT WITH MAJORITY VOTE. ON THAT ISSUE TO BE TO DO THE TEST THAT THAT DEEP DIVE. ON THE ISSUE OF TAX CREDITS TRYING TO GO TO CENTER AND HOW TO PLEASE. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR. OF THE OF NOT ED NECESSARILY PREPARED TO SUPPORT THE BILL TODAY I HAVE REAL CONCERNS REGARDING- PUBLICLY DISCLOSING THAT INFORMATION BUT- I THINK WHAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO IS. IS THE RIGHT THING AND I THINK IT. WOULD NEED TO BE WORKING ON THAT AND- I GUESS MY QUESTION IS- WHY NOT GIVE F. T. BEAT THE ABILITY TO. TO FURTHER INSPECT THAT THE ADDITIONAL CRITERIA THAT YOU'RE SEEKING TO. GET OLD TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION SO THAT THEY COULD MAKE THAT DETERMINATION OF WHETHER OR NOT THE FACT THAT THAT THAT. THAT TAX CREDIT ELIGIBILITY AND I THINK THAT. MIGHT MAKE IT MORE IMMEDIATE DIFFERENCE IN TERMS OF THE SEASONS FOR THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THE TERROR PLEASE. ON THE DIFFICULTY IS OUR WHILE SOMETIMES WE FEEL THAT AGENCIES OVERREACH OUR OVERSTAFFED OUR AGENCIES ARE RESPONSIBLE TO IMPLEMENTING POLICY WE DIRECT AND THEY ARE NOT THEMSELVES IN FACT THEY CANNOT INITIATE POLICY OR OR- I MEAN IN EFFECT WHAT YOU ARE DESCRIBING WHICH I AGREE WITH. IS EIGHT IS. A POLICY ON IS PUTTING HAVE TO BE IN THE POSITION OF AN OF ENACTING POLICY FOR WHICH WE HAVE NOT DIRECTED THEM TO DO SO AND SO. UNTIL WE- GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO BASICALLY PROVIDE US WITH THIS. INDIVIDUALIZED DATA THEN IT NEITHER NEITHER CAN NAY RECOMMEND POLICY NOR CAN WE-BECAUSE TECHNICALLY IT WE HAVE. BY STE BY. BY THE PRIVACY ELEMENTS OF OUR TAX LAW WHICH ARE VERY IMPORTANT I AM NOT TRYING TO ON UP TURNER ON TURN ALL THE PRIVACY ELEMENTS OF OUR TAX LAW BUT DUE TO THOSE THE F. T. B. IS A PROHIBITED FROM CERTAIN- FROM GIVING A CERTAIN INFORMATION. THANK YOU SO MUCH INNING ON CETER TOWN. WILL BE IT THANK YOU I THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ADDITIONAL QUESTIONS COMMENTS CONVERSATION FROM THIS COMMITTEE FOR RETURN RISEN AS SKINNER FOR CLOTHES. THAT ONE THING PLEASE THANKS SENATOR RAISED A PORTENT POINT I. MY ONLY EXPERIENCE IN UNITED SUPPORT THESE THINGS MANY YEARS AGO. THE REASON I SUPPORTED TODAY IS BECAUSE- WE'VE JUST TRIED EVERYTHING UNDER THE SUN YOUR MEAN THIS IDEA OF. AS CENTERS SKINNER TALKED ABOUT THE FRANCHISE TAX BOARD AND YOU KNOW THE IT MUST BE GIVEN DIRECTIONS STOCK IN A HAPPEN. YOU WE'VE GOT THIS VERY DEAL DELICATE DANCE IN THIS TAX THING AND WE'VE JUST AT SOME POINT I MEAN I'M AT THE POINT QUITE FRANKLY WHERE. I DON'T OF OURS WORDS OF MIKE THIS TEN YEARS AGO BUT I AND I'M SUPPORTING IT NOW AS A RESULT OF WATCHING THIS AND STILL MORE MORE TAX CREDITS WHICH IS OFTEN THE RIGHT THING TO DO I'M NOT OBJECTING TO THAT SOMETIMES IT MAKES SENSE. I JUST WANT TO KNOW HOW THEY WORK AND NEED PRACTICAL TOOLS TO FIGURE THAT OUT. AND WE'VE TRIED SO MANY THINGS OVER THE YEARS THE REASON I'M CONCERNED AND WANT TO GO TO THIS ROUTE THINK THAT. CENTER SKINNER BILLS GOOD IS BECAUSE I THINK THAT WE HAVE TO DO THIS TO MAKE IT EFFECTIVE OTHERWISE WE'RE JUST ENGAGED IN THE VORTEX OF NOTHINGNESS AND- WE HAVE ANOTHER TWENTY YEARS AND DON'T MOVE THE BALL DON'T. WE JUST KICKING THE CAN DOWN THE ROAD SO TO SPEAK SO THAT'S WHY I THINK WHICH IS DOING IS INTELLIGENCE WANTED TO ADD THAT IN. TO WHAT YOU ALREADY SAID SENATOR. THANK YOU SO MUCH AS A MAJORITY LEADER SENATOR ANY LAST. MINUTE COMMENTS FOR CLOSE I WOULD ONLY DO MICHAEL. ART THANK YOU SOME. LEASING JENNA COMMITTEE THIS IT DOES HAVE A MOTION THAT'S ON THE FLOOR IN OTHER WORDS I WOULD DO A CLOSE BUT I DIDN'T KNOW IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WERE YES I'M SORRY I TELL YOU TO YOUR NEW CAR ASKING TO CONTEST HERTZBERG WORK CLOTHES A WOULD APPRECIATE BEING ABLE CLIPS FEES. THANK YOU FOR THIS GREAT DEBATE. I JUST WANT TO REITERATE SB NINE SEVEN TWO DOES NOT RAISE TAXES IT DOES NOT ELIMINATE ANY TAXES AND IT COVERS. CORPORATIONS THAT. DO BUSINESS IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY'RE NOT HEADQUARTERED THEY DON'T HAVE TO BE HEADQUARTERED HERE SO IT'S NOT JUST GOING AFTER CALIFORNIA CORPORATIONS IT IS PURELY GIVING US AS POLICY MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC SOME INFORMATION THAT WOULD ALLOW US TO APPROPRIATELY EVALUATE OUR EXPENDITURES. AND HAVE AN INFORMED DEBATE AROUND WHEN WE ARE MAKING EXPENDITURE CUTS NOW THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT DURING A DOWNTURN AS WE ARE NOW DISCO BUT NINETEEN INDUCED ECONOMIC DOWNTURN WHERE IN THE BUDGET THE GOVERNOR'S PRESENTED TO US THAT'S A FIFTY FOUR BILLION DOLLARS OF CUTS. AND WHILE I AM NOT POSING RIGHT NOW AT ALL ANY REDUCTION OR ELIMINATION OF TAX CREDITS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO EVALUATE. OTHER EXPENDITURE CUTS THAT ARE IN THAT BUDGET WITHOUT HAVING FULL ACCESS TO DATA ON ALL OF OUR DIFFERENT EXPENDITURES AND OF COURSE TAX CREDITS ARE A BIG EXPENDITURE NOW THE TOTAL VALUE OF TAX CREDITS WITHIN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR EVERY HE IS LIKE IN THE SEVENTY BILLION% ORDER. SO IN A WAY WE SHOULD BE DOING A DATABASE THAT COVERS ALL OF THEM BUT THAT WOULD BE QUITE EXPENSIVE IN QUITE SO I'M TRYING TO START MODESTLY. AND I FOUND THE DEBATE WITH OPPOSITION IN A AND THE SUPPORTERS VERY FASCINATING WE SOUND LIKE YOUR CLASSIC KINDA LEFT RIGHT IN AND- IT SHOULD NOT BE REDUCED TO THAT THIS SHOULD BE REALLY A DEBATE AROUND THE INFORMATION THE PUBLIC. AND POLICY MAKERS NEED TO MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS WHICH WE DON'T HAVE. AND WHILE THERE IS A REFERENCE TO SHAME I'M NOT SURE- WHO WHO BROUGHT IT UP FOR WHAT COMMON MAYBE IT WAS A LETTER OF OPPOSITION. THAT IS NOT MY PURPOSE. WE ALREADY KNOW FROM THE SEC FILINGS WHAT LARGE COMPANIES DON'T PAY ANY FEDERAL TAXES SO BUT THE PURPOSE FOR ME IS NOT SHAME IT'S PURELY. FOR US TO BE ABLE TO. HAVE INFORMATION THAT CAN ALLOW US I WAS BUDGET YEAR DURING PART OF THE DOWNTURN. AND NOT HAVING GOOD ACCESS TO.

AGENCY DISSOLUTION IS PASSED WE HAVE TO DO THIS IN ORDER FOR HERCULES TO BE ABLE TO AND THE REASON THAT HERCULES COULD NOT IN THE PAST WAS THERE WAS A LAWSUIT BETWEEN THE STATE AND THE CITY OF HERCULES THAT LAWSUIT IS SETTLED.

REDEVELOPMENT BILL WE ARE NOT TRYING TO RE LITIGATE THAT ISSUE. THOSE BILLS FREQUENTLY HAVE- LOCAL ENTITIES FIGHTING OVER A SET STREAM. THE PURPOSE OF THIS LEGISLATION IS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE HISTORICALLY LOW. INTEREST RATES AND CREATE SAVINGS FOR ALL THE LOCAL ENTITIES. SO WE'RE LOOKING OUT OVER THE NEXT TWENTY YEARS OF UP TO FORTY TWO MILLION LOCALLY- TWENTY FIVE THAT MILLION OF THAT GOING TO LOCAL SCHOOLS. THIS IS A GOOD TIME TO BE FINDING WAYS THAT DON'T COST THE STATE MONEY. BUT TO ALLOW FOR THE SAVINGS THE SECOND ISSUE IS ABOUT THE PRESIDENT. AGAIN THIS IS NOT RE OPENING A REDEVELOPMENT WE DID OUR RESEARCH ARE ONLY EIGHT OTHER CITIES. THAT ARE IN THIS PARTICULAR- CIRCUMSTANCES HERCULES AND- NONE OF THEM ARE LOOKING TOWARDS- TRYING TO. MOVE FORWARD WITH THIS PATHWAY. AND FRANKLY IT IT'S MADE IT EASY FOR US TO ACCEPT THE COMMITTEE'S RECOMMENDATION AT THIS JUST BE.

HOUSING AFFORDABILITY CRISIS IN ORDER TO MEET THE NEEDS OF CALIFORNIA'S FAMILIES THE STATE MUST INCREASE HOUSING PRODUCTION. TO TWO HUNDRED THOUSAND HOUSING UNITS PER YEAR. YET THE LACK OF AVAILABLE LAND FOR RESIDENTIAL pDEVELOPMENT CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE. MANY OF OUR CITIES ARE BUILT OUT OR DON'T HAVE READILY AVAILABLE VACANT LAND AND OTHER CITIES ARE ELECTED TO ENCROACH ON THE ADJACENT PRODUCTIVE FARMLAND. PARK AND A RANCH LAND. SENATE BILL THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE AIMS TO SPUR HOUSING PRODUCTION BY AUTHORIZING RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON EXISTING LOT LOT.

LIVER WORK PLAY VILLAGE THE WALKABLE VILLAGE CONCEPT WILL ALSO HELP TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSION. BY CREATING THE OPPORTUNITY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF VEHICLE TRIPS.

SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE WILL REQUIRE HOUSING DEVELOPMENT TO MEET OR EXCEED THE DENSITY DEEMED APPROPRIATE TO ACCOMMODATE AFFORDABLE HOUSING SUCH AS APARTMENTS TOWN HOMES AND CONDOMINIUMS. SUBJECTED DEVELOPMENT TO LOCAL PLANNING PARKING IN DESIGN ORDINANCES. AND AUTHORIZES LOCAL GOVERNMENT TO ESTABLISH A COMMUNITY FINANCE DISTRICT TO PROVIDE FOR AND MAINTAIN PUBLIC INFRASTRUCTURE. AND LASTLY THE BILL WILL ALLOW THE DEVELOPMENT OF HOUSING BY RIGHT UNDER CERTAIN LIMITED CONDITIONS INCLUDED INCLUDING IF A COMMERCIAL PROPERTY IS VACANT FOR MORE THAN THREE YEARS AND IT IT UTILIZES A REALLY GREAT- BILL THAT WAS PASSED BY SENATOR WIENER SB THIRTY FIVE THE ELEMENTS IN THAT BILL. WITH NO COST TO THE STATE SB THIRTY EIGHTY FIVE ALL INCENTIVIZE RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT WITHOUT IMPACTING SINGLE FAMILY NEIGHBORHOODS BY. GIVING LAND OWNERS AND DEVELOPERS A WAY TO MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR HOUSING THE BILL WILL ALSO SPUR ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN REGION'S MOST IN NEED A REVITALIZED REVITALIZATION.

IN PRIOR TO THE KOBE NINETEEN PANDEMIC MANY BRICK AND MORTAR BUSINESSES ARE STRUGGLING WITH THE GROWTH TO BE COMMERCE AND THE SHORT MONTH OF THE CURRENT CRISIS WE'VE ALREADY SEEN SEVERAL MAJOR RETAILERS FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY. UNFORTUNATELY WE SHOULD EXPECT IF YOU'RE MARKET OBJECT AND UNDER UTILIZED AND BAKING COMMERCIAL PROPERTY GOING FORWARD. SB THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE CREATE AN ALTERNATE PATHWAY FOR LANDOWNERS IN DEVELOPERS THAT WILL HELP MEET THE GROWING DEMAND FOR HOUSING BY UTILIZING LAND THAT IS ALREADY A PART OF THE URBAN LANDSCAPE. UNDER UTILIZED- BAKING COMMERCIAL SPACES ARE OFTEN PRIME LAND CLOSE TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION AND CONTAIN SIGNIFICANT ACREAGE THE COULD BE DEVELOPED FOR HOUSING MIXED USE. AS VENDOR DESCRIBED AT THE THIRTEEN EIGHTY FIVE ESSENTIALLY OCTONE COMMERCIAL AND RETAIL PROPERTIES TO ALLOW RESIDENTIAL USES AT THE ENTITIES THAT ARE JEAN AFFORDABLE BY DESIGN UNDER EXISTING STATE LAW. DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS WOULD HAVE TO MEET ALL APPLICABLES STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

BUSINESS AND I WANT TO ENSURE THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE TAKING. THE AN IMMENSE AS PRESENTED THE FLOOR IS YOURS SIR. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES. INDEED I WILL BE DELIGHTED TO ACCEPT. COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. ALL DOCTORS AS OFTEN AS MEN THAT SUIT FOR CHAIR. WE'VE HAD LAST YEAR HAD SOME AN INTERESTING YEAR TO SAY THE LEAST. BUT HAS OF WHAT. THE EVOLVED I WANTED TO SAY. THE VAULT BUT LET PUBLIC POWER IN A PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. WERE EMPLOYED. NOW SURELY WHO HOPE THAT THIS DOES NOT BECOME THE NEW NORM. AS A STRATEGY FOR DEALING WITH THESE KIND OF CRISES IT'S VERY WRONG WAY IN FACT TO DEAL WITH THE- BUT WHAT DID THEN DEVELOPED FOR A WHOLE LOT OF REASONS AND I'M NOT GETTING INTO A COMPLAINT SESSION ABOUT ALL OF THOSE REASONS. BUT THERE WAS A DELUGE I THINK IN MOST OF OUR OFFICES. OF INDIVIDUALS. COMPLAINING ABOUT THIS PUBLIC POWER SHUT OFF AND THAT THEY DIDN'T KNOW AND THE TIMING WAS TOO SHORT TO DO ANY GOOD FOR TO RENDER PREPARE THEMSELVES ETCETERA ETCETERA. AT THAT THAT READY WAS IT WAS A DILEMMA FOR US LAST YEAR. THIS BILL INTENT THE END IS TO ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. PARTICULARLY FOR SOME OF OUR AGENCIES. THIS WOULD ALLOW THEN THAT ON SUCH OCCASIONS OF THE PUBLIC POWER SHUT OFF. WHENEVER THAT THAN IT DID OCCUR. THERE WE THE OPPORTUNITY. FOR THE LOCAL PUBLIC AGENCIES. TO RECEIVE SOME ASSISTANCE HERE. TO BE ABLE TO NEGOTIATE AND WHAT WOULD I DO PROVIDING BACKUP GENERATORS THEY BECAME VERY MUCH IN DEMAND EVERYWHERE LAST YEAR BACK A BACKUP GENERATORS. THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THEN THESE ENTITIES. TO PURCHASE BACKUP GENERATORS BUT AN INCENTIVE. WOULD BE THE EQUIPMENT AND SERVICE SEVEN AND A HALF PERCENT SALES TAX WITH A WOULD BE EXEMPTED FROM THAT SALES TAX AS AN INCENTIVE TO IF YOU WILL POWER UP TO HAVE BACK UP GENERATIONS KEEPING NECESSARY SERVICES GOING. DO YOU HAVE COMMITTEE AMENDMENTS. MORE CLEARLY STATE AND CODIFY THE STANDARD FOR BACK UP GENERATIONS. DEFINES CRITICAL FUNCTIONS WHICH WOULD TRIGGER AND SUPPORT SUCH A BACKUP IN THE EMPLOYING SUCH BACKUP GENERATION. THAT THE GENERATION WOULD BE STRICTLY FOR THE PURPOSE OF POWER GENERATION. DURING THE SHUTDOWN. IN A FIVE YEAR SUNSET AND A REPORT. TO THE LEDGE OF LEGISLATIVE-ANALYST'S OFFICE AS TO HOW THIS WAS GOING ALONG. I'M. JANET NOT REALLY ENTHUSIASTIC ABOUT THESE KINDS OF THINGS BUT THIS IS SUCH A CRITICAL. SITUATION FOR OUR CONSTITUENTS FOR THE PEOPLE THERE IN CONVENIENCE. IN A DAY THEIR HEALTH AND SAFETY. SO MISTER CHAIRMAN AND COLLEAGUES WHAT MY DESIRE HERE IS TO ALLOW ANOTHER TOOL IN THE TOOLBOX. TO BE ABLE TO IMPAIR OR THESE AGENCIES TO HAVE A BIT OF AN INCENTIVE AND YOU KNOW WE ALL KNOW HOW TROUBLED THEY ARE. A TO GET THESE BACK UP GENERATORS IN PLACE. AND TO SOFTEN. THE IMPACT. OF THE PUBLIC SAFETY POWER SHUT OFFS. THAT IS THE BILL MISTER CHAIRMAN HYDE SUBMITTED TO THE COMMITTEE. THANK YOU SO MUCH.

USUALLY I HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME WHEN SACRAMENTO GIVES A SALES TAX BREAK. ON PRODUCTS WHICH MEANS THAT THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY CITY YOUR COUNTY WILL REALLY LOSE OUT ON. THE SALES TAX REVENUES I DON'T SEEM TO SEE IT OPPOSITION FROM THE CITIES. OR COUNTIES TO YOUR BILL- SO I GUESS I COULD. MODIFY MY APPROACH BUT I'M WONDERING INSTEAD OF. GIVING A SALES TAX BREAK WHICH MEANS THE LOCAL MUNICIPALITY WOULD LOSE A PORTION OF THE REVENUES WHY NOT HAVE THE STATE JUST GIVE- A REBATE FOR THE SALES TAX PORTION IT RECEIVES. SIR NIELSEN WELL IF THE FEDERAL THAT THAT COULD BE A CONSIDERATION BUT- IF MARKETS AND DINNER BRACING FOR THIS WHAT MY FOCUS ON WAS THE- A PERILOUS JEOPARDY THAT WE ARE. AGENCIES THAT DO NEED TO RESPOND AND BE TIMELY THE HOW COULD WE BEST THE DIRECT MOST DIRECTLY HELP THEM. AND INDEED I'M GLAD THE LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE NOT FELT THAT THIS WAS A HUGE PROBLEM RATHER MAYBE LOOKING AT INTO THE HELP TO THEM BECAUSE THEY RECEIVED I'M SURE QUITE A FEW OF THESE CALLS AS WELL. BUT IT DIDN'T I WOULDN'T FOCUSING ON THE STATE RESOURCES OR FROM THE STATE BUDGET OF. FOR OBVIOUS REASONS WE'RE WE'RE AND PERILOUS TIMES AND I DON'T THINK WE CAN BE ASKING MORE HELP TO YOU KNOW TO BE A SPECIAL LEGISLATION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF THESE GENERATORS AND SO THE SALES TAX SEEM TO BE THE MOST EXPEDITIOUS AND DIRECT APPROACH TO ME. IN A- I BE ENTERTAINING BEATLES THOUGHTS ABOUT IT THAT I. I HAVEN'T FOCUSED ON THAT AT ALL AND I'D BE WILLING TO HAVE CONVERSATIONS WITH THE SENATOR ON THIS MATTER MAYBE THERE'S A WAY WE COULD TO CUT SO AMENDED LIKE I JUST DON'T REALLY SEE IT THE MOST PRACTICAL.
