GOOD MORNING CHAIR AND MEMBERS VAN PRESENTING AB TWENTY ONE THIRTY FIVE THE BILL TO IMPLEMENT THE STATE AUDITOR'S RECOMMENDATION THAT STATE ENTITIES NOT UNDER THE CONTROL OF THE GOVERNOR BOB THE BASIC SECURITY CYBER SECURITY STANDARDS WHILE THIS BILL IS GOING INTO SUSPENSE TODAY I WANT TO POINT OUT THE FINANCIAL INCONSISTENCIES THAT HAVE PLAGUED PRIOR VERSIONS AND THE CURRENT BILL WELL CONSTITUTIONAL OFFICERS. OF WHO WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE STANDARDS HAVE TOLD POLICY COMMITTEES THAT THEY ALREADY MEET ALL CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS THEY PROVIDE COST ESTIMATES TO THIS COMMITTEE. AS IF THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY SECURITY AT ALL THIS YEAR SUBMISSION FROM THE STATE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ESTIMATES THE NEED FOR SIX POINT EIGHT MILLION DOLLARS AND THIRTY EIGHT NEW POSITIONS TO ADOPT BASIC STANDARDS INCLUDED IN THIS BILL. THESE COST ESTIMATES THAT SEEM DIVORCED FROM REALITY LAST YEAR AS OF LAST YEAR FOR A VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL BILL THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE ESTIMATED. THAT WOULD COST BETWEEN A HUNDRED NINETY FIVE AND 300-405-0008 TWENTY FOLD INCREASE WITH NO CHANGE AT ALL TO THE BILL. THIS IS AFTER THE COMPTROLLER'S OFFICE HAD A BCP AND LAST YEAR'S BUDGET FOR THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND DOLLARS THAT WAS JUSTIFIED BY THEIR NEED TO CONTINUE TO MEET THESE STANDARDS. I COULD GO ON WITH OTHER EXAMPLES OF THE CALL. OFFICERS PLAN AND WITH THEIR ESTIMATES ON THIS ISSUE LIKE THE DEPARTMENT OF FINANCE. WHOSE ESTIMATE LAST YEAR OF THREE HUNDRED SIXTY ONE THOUSAND BALLOON TO ONE POINT FOUR MILLION THIS YEAR. BUT AT THE END OF THE DAY MY MESSAGE TO THIS COMMITTEE IS SIMPLE YEAR AFTER YEAR THE AUDITOR AND THE INDEPENDENT THREAT REPORTS HAVE MADE CLEAR THAT EVERY STATE AGENCY NEEDS TO HAVE MINIMUM CYBERSECURITY STANDARDS IN PLACE.

ON YOU KNOW WE'RE IN A TIME WHEN THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF DIVISION IN OUR STATE IN OUR NATION. AND I THINK. AS ELECTED OFFICIALS. THE ALL IMPORTANT THING IS HOW DO WE MAINTAIN A WORKABLE CENTER HOW WE WORK TOGETHER THE GOVERNANCE OF THE STATE AB TWENTY EIGHT TWENTY EIGHT NINETEEN IS TAKES NOTE OF THE FACT THAT LAST TIME. ARE FINANCED LOOKED AT OUR STATE'S FIFTY EIGHT COUNTIES TWENTY EIGHT OF THEM WERE IDENTIFIED AS HAVING ZERO GROWTH ARE ACTUALLY SHRINKING. YOU TEND TO BE OUR MORE RURAL COUNTY. AND WE IN THE STATE ACTUALLY HAVE A LONG HISTORY. OF THE STATE LEVEL CREATING TOOLS TO SUPPORT LOCAL INITIATIVES IDENTIFY ISSUES YOU WANT TO WORK ON THE NEED TO WORK ON. THIS IS A INFRASTRUCTURE BANK WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY AUTHORED BY MARIAN BERGESON AND STEVE PEACE REPUBLICAN DEMOCRAT WORKING TOGETHER CREATED A FUNDING MECHANISM. THIS BILL TAKING NOTE OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE SUCH AN EXTRAORDINARY FLOOD OF REVENUE. PROPOSES THAT WE SHOULD SET ASIDE EIGHT BILLION DOLLARS. FOR COMPETITIVE GRANTS THE COULD BE ACCESSED IN COUNTIES UNDER MY SPECIAL DISTRICTS INDEPENDENT FAR DIFFERENT. A LIKE A VOLUNTEER FIRE DEPARTMENT I HAVE WILTED AND ERROL. AND ARE COUNTIES UNDER THREE HUNDRED THOUSAND. TO FOCUS PRIMARILY ON PRIMARILY ON DISASTROUS. BUT THAT COULD BE FACILITIES THAT COULD BE UPGRADING OF FACILITIES IT WILL BE A SHELTER IN PLACE A VENN FIRES LIKE THE AMADOR COUNTY FAIRGROUNDS- AND ALSO ROAD PROJECTS WHICH WOULD BE IMPORTANT KIND OF EGRESS FOR. VIRGIN IT DOES REQUIRE THAT THE ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS OF THIS PROGRAM IN THE AYE BANK. WOULD BE PAID BY UP FRONT FEES OF PETITIONS THOSE LOAN PROGRAM WOULD HAVE TO PAY FEED I. BAKED WOULD COVER THE DISTRICT COURT. THIS PROGRAM. BUT IT WOULD ESTABLISH A SYSTEM OF COMPETITIVE GRANTS. TO FUND THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS AND IN THAT SENSE I THINK IT IS IT IS AN AIR OF SO MUCH WHAT WE'VE DONE WHERE YOU KNOW. THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT YOU HAVE PEOPLE DEVOTED TO THE WELL BEING OF THEIR COMMUNITIES. A FUNDING STREAM IS REALLY A WAY TO RELEASE LOCAL ENERGY ON THESE TYPES OF PROJECTS. IT REQUIRES THAT ANY PROJECT LOCALLY THESE FUNDS COULD ONLY GO 250% OF THE PROJECT COST WHAT DOES REQUIRE DEVELOPMENT OF PARTNERSHIPS TO MOVE THIS FORWARD. I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IS A- IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO TAKE NOTE OF THE CHALLENGES OF OUR RURAL COUNTIES THE UNUSUAL. REVENUES ARE PRESENT AVAILABLE AND YOU KINDA LOOK ACROSS THE STATE TO SAY ACTUALLY THIS IS A TIME TO FILL ORDER STEP UP AS A STATE TO SUPPORT OUR MORE RURAL COUNTIES WHO ARE CHALLENGED BY THINGS AND OF. TO PROVIDE SOME FUNDED THEM GET BUSY CONTACTED LOCAL FIRE. ARM IT IS A BILL SUPPORTED BY OR C. SACK ALLEN'S OF CALIFORNIA. THE FIRE DISTRICTS OF CALIFORNIA THE FIRE CHIEFS OF CALIFORNIA AND SPECIAL DISTRICTS. AND AS I SAY I ACTUALLY THINK THIS IDEA IS DESIGNED TO KIND OF BUILD UPON THIS ACTED VERY AND BURZYNSKI POTTER SO LONG AGO. WHO REQUIRE PARTICIPANTS TO KIND OF COVER THE ADMINISTRATIVE OVERHEAD. BUT BEYOND THAT PROVIDE FUNDING THAT COULD SUPPORT THE SORTS OF THINGS I THINK LARGER COUNTIES WILL FIND WAYS TO PIECE TOGETHER VITAL PROJECTS THIS IS REALLY TAKING NOTE OF THE CHALLENGING TIMES OF A RURAL COUNTIES. I THINK IT WOULD BE A- GREAT THING FOR ALL OF US I DO NOTE THAT WHEN I WAS AN OFFICER OF THE LEAGUE. OF ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER BROUGHT MEASURE B. THE STATEWIDE BALLOT WHICH IS FUNDING FOR. ROADWAYS AND A GUARANTEED EVERY CITY AND COUNTY AND STATE HAD FUNDS. SOBRE WHEN WE DID PROP TWENTY ONE WE TOOK CARE OF FUNDING. FOR THE ENTIRE STATE. AND EVERY JURISDICTION. THIS IS AN IDEA THAT DEMONSTRABLY IS POPULAR WITH CALIFORNIA. AND OKAY THIS IS SORT OF. A FIX FOR SAYS THERE IS A TIE THE FIRST ABANDONED HERE CAPTION OF RIDES ON VICTORY WE HAVE A LOT OF REVENUE. I THINK ALLOWS US THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE SOME STEPS THAT ARE GOING TO BE DIFFERENT. A BILLION DOLLARS IS A BIG NUMBER BUT I THINK THIS YEAR. HI THIS WAY- IT'LL BE TO OUR CREDIT AND WE WON'T MISS. WE KNOW IT WILL BE PUT TO GOOD USE. THE RESPONSE ALSO A INCREASE IN FIRES A CLIMATE CHANGE THAT SAID I JUST TAKE THE PROVINCIAL THIS BUSY MORNING. A TO TAKE YOUR TRYING TO BETTER UNDERSTAND. PICTURE WORSE THANK YOU- ON THE SUSPENSE SIX ADDED BILL WILL ALSO TAKE THOSE WHO WOULD LIKE TO COMMENT IN SUPPORT. FOR OPPOSITION. ORDER UP MR CHAIRMAN MEMBERS MIKE WEST ON BEHALF OF THE STATE BUILDING AND CONSTRUCTION TRADES COUNCIL WEREN'T SUPPORTED THIS EFFORT RECEIVE THE DIALOGUE WITH THE MEMBER WE LOOK FORWARD TO GETTING ONE FINAL ROUND OF AMENDMENTS INCLUDE IN THE BILL.

THANK YOU MR CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY STEP WHICH IS A GOOD NEIGHBOR POLICY FOR LOGISTICS DEVELOPMENTS AND IN RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITIES. THE LOGISTICS SECTOR IS CLEARLY A ONE THAT FEELS THE NEED FOR EVERYONE TO CALIFORNIA BY ENSURING THE GOODS MOVE TO THEIR INTENDED DESTINATION NO ONE DISPUTES THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF LOGISTICS. AND THAT CALIFORNIA IS A LEADER IN THE SECTOR. HOWEVER THE LOGISTICS SECTOR SPECIFICALLY WAREHOUSES SHOULD BE GOOD NEIGHBOURS TO THE COMMUNITIES THERE IN. IN MY COMMUNITY AND COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE WHERE HOUSES ARE BEING BUILT RIGHT NEXT TO HOMES AND SCHOOLS THAT INCREASES THE RISK OF HEALTH PROBLEMS FOR LOCAL COMMUNITIES. MORE WAREHOUSES A MORE LARGE TRUCKS DRIVING IN AND OUT OF PREDOMINANTLY BLACK. LATINO IMMIGRANT AND LOW INCOME NEIGHBORHOODS WHERE THE FACILITIES ARE LOCATED. AS EARLY AS TWO THOUSAND FIVE THE AIR RESOURCES BOARD RECOMMENDED A BUFFER ZONE BETWEEN RESIDENTIAL NEIGHBORHOODS AND WAREHOUSES. IN MY DISTRICT IN THE COMMUNITY BLOOMINGTON SIX OUT OF EIGHT SCHOOLS. ARE LOCATED OR WILL BE LOCATED. RIGHT NEXT TO WHERE HOUSE. AB TWENTY EIGHT FORTY PROVIDES THAT IF YOU'RE GOING TO BUILD OR EXPAND A LOGISTICS FACILITY OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND SQUARE FEET OR MORE. IT MUST HAVE A SET BACK ONE THOUSAND FEET FROM SENSITIVE RECEPTORS WHICH INCLUDE HOMES SCHOOLS HOSPITALS DAY CARE CENTERS COMMUNITY CENTERS. IT ALSO ALLOWS ALTERNATIVES TO THE SETBACK REQUIREMENT IF THOSE ALTERNATIVES WOULD PROVIDE THE SAME LEVEL OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AS A ONE THOUSAND FOOT BUFFER ZONE.

GOOD MORNING I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE STARTING TRANSPARENCY IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AND WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERYONE ALL OF OUR RESIDENTS ARE SAFE ESPECIALLY DURING A TIME OF EMERGENCY. I AM VERY CONCERNED ABOUT. THE FACT THAT IT IS OPPOSED ONLY BY CJ BUT PRETTY MUCH THE MAJORITY OF THE HOSPITALS IN MY AREA. SO I WILL SUPPORT IT TO GET OUT OF APPROACH TODAY BUT I DO HOPE THAT YOU CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THEM. AND I LOOK AT THEIR AMENDMENTS AND CONSIDER TAKING THEM- SO THAT I CAN SUPPORT IT ON THE FLOOR AS WELL. ABSOLUTELY I APPRECIATE THOSE COMMENTS YOU KNOW WE HAVE WORKED WITH- THE OPPOSITION WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO. I THINK THEIR MAIN OPPOSITION AS WAS STATED TO YOU PERSONALLY BUT I JUST DON'T LIKE KERN LAW. THIS DOESN'T. YOUR CHANGE CURRENT LAW IT'S JUST ABOUT TRANSPARENCY I DON'T THINK WE'RE GONNA GET TO A PLACE. WHERE YOU KNOW THEY'RE GONNA BE SATISFIED BECAUSE OF THEIR CONCERNS WITH CURRENT LAW. ABOUT AGAIN THIS IS ABOUT TRANSPARENCY ABOUT ITS ABOUT- INSURING THAT OUR COMMUNITIES ARE PREPARED I COME FROM. A REGION THAT WAS THE EPICENTER OF OUR YOU KNOW THE LAST MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OF OUR STATE AND IN- NINETEEN EIGHTY NINE.

THANK THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR I JUST WANTED TO ALIGN MY COMMENTS WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM SAN DIEGO TO THE AUTHOR I'VE HAD A COUPLE OF HOSPITALS CLOSE IN MY DISTRICT BECAUSE ISSUES RELATED TO WHAT YOU WANT TO ADDRESS. UP I DIVIDE MY COMMUNITY CANNOT SEE ANYMORE CLOSURES OF HOSPITALS AND SO IN ONE OF THE DISTRICTS THAT WAS HARDEST HIT BY COVERT I WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. THERE IS INTENTIONALITY AND TRYING TO WORK WITH THE HOSPITAL SOME OF WHICH HAVE FROM MY OWN COMMUNITY HAVE PUT IN THEIR LETTERS OF OPPOSITION AND I WANT TO HELP THEM GET TO A BETTER PLACE TO UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS THAT YOU'RE TRYING TO DO SO AT THE END OF THE DAY WE'RE PROVIDING.

BIGELOW I THINK I WANNA CHIME AND A LOT OF THOSE COMMENTS THAT OUR COLLEAGUE OVER HERE JUST SPOKE AND I LIKE THAT- THANK THE AUTHOR FOR HEARING THOSE COMMENTS I APPRECIATE THAT THE FACT THAT.YOU'VE TAKEN ON THIS ISSUE I WOULD HOPE THAT YOU WOULD TAKE ON A GREATER ISSUE WHILE THERE IS. CURRENT LAW ANYWHERE THE EPICENTER OF A LOT OF TRAGIC. ACTIVITY THAT OCCURRED. THERE IS. A GREATER TRAGEDY THAT'S GOING TO OCCUR- SOMEBODY WHO REPRESENTS TWELVE HOSPITALS. AND ALL OF THEM ARE GOING TO BE CLOSING. IN EVERYONE OF THOSE COMMUNITIES SHORTLY. BECAUSE THEY CAN'T MEET THE DEMANDS. AND I THINK WE LOOK AT ONE OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY. SINGLE ON AND ONLY- I'M A CENTERS. THEY'RE ABOUT TO LOSE MORE THAN 70% OF THEIR BAD. IF THE PUBLIC BECOMES MORE AWARE OF WHAT WE'RE GOING TO LOSE AND WE'RE AFTER WHAT WE JUST CAME THROUGH. WITH THE TRAUMA OF COVERT- WHERE WILL WE BE WITHOUT THOSE HOSPITALS AND THOSE THAT. BECAUSE WE CAN'T USE THEM. THE B. JUST. SHELLS OF THE BUILDINGS STANDING THERE.
