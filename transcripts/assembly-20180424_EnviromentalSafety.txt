HELLO EVERYONE WE'RE GOING TO START NOW. OUR PROCEDURE WILL BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT YOU CAN TELL MY VOICE IS NOT NORMAL. SO I VAST. MY GOOD FRIEND AND VICE CHAIR. MELISSA MELENDEZ TO. ARE CONDUCTED GOOD PART OF THE MEETING I WILL DO THE CLOTHES BUT I WANT TO SAVE MY VOICE AT THAT. AND SO SHE WILL NOW NOT CALL UP. THE FIRST PRESENTER. IF WE HAVE SOMEONE HERE NOT YET NOT WE HAVE ONE FOR A MINUTE. DOING A SHOW OR DO ANY DO YOURS GET EVER. WELL SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ANY OTHER AUTHORS HERE CHAIRMAN IS GOING TO GO AHEAD AND PRESENT HIS BILL WHICH IS FILE ITEM NUMBER FOUR. A. B. TWO FOUR SEVEN FOR AND I GUESS I SHOULD MENTION WE ARE OPERATING AS A SUB COMMITTEE RIGHT NOW SINCE WE DON'T QUITE HAVE A QUORUM BAKER HAD MR CHAIRMAN. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM VICE CHAIR. AB TWENTY FOUR SEVENTY FOR REQUIRES DTS SEE TO VALUE WAIT AND ADOPT. YOU MAIN OPTIONAL ALTERNATIVES. THE CUTE. CHRONIC TOXICITY TEST. OR HAZARDOUS WASTE IDENTIFICATION. IF THEY MEET. APARTMENTS NEED. OR HAZARDOUS WASTE IDENTIFICATION. THE POINT IS THAT. WE WANT THE DEPARTMENT TO DECIDE WE'RE GOING TO SUGGEST SOME TASKS BUT WE WANT TO DEPARTMENT TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT THEY ACTUALLY. ACCOMPLISH. WHAT'S NEEDED. I I AND I WILL NOW LET MY WITNESSES TESTIFY THANK YOU. YOU HAVE FOUR MINUTES. THANK YOU MY NAME IS CHRISTY SOLVENT AND I'M A TOXICOLOGISTS A CALIFORNIA RESIDENT AND THE VICE PRESIDENT FOR RESEARCH POLICY AT THE PHYSICIANS COMMITTEE FOR RESPONSIBLE MEDICINE. OR THE SPONSOR OF THIS OF OF OF THIS BILL. I CURRENTLY HAZARDOUS WASTES IS TESTED THROUGHOUT CALIFORNIA WITH A LIVE FISH TASKS. AND THERE ARE A NUMBER OF PROBLEMS WITH THIS. INCLUDING THAT FISH. PUT UP WITH THE LIVE FISH. COULD BE REPLACED WITH A COUPLE OF ALTERNATIVES THAT ARE AS. I HUGE I AS AN AN AN ISSUE WITH RELATE REGARDS TO HUMANE USE OF ANIMALS. AND. WE SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT OFFERS DTS SEE AN OPPORTUNITY TO ASSESS ADVANCES AND TEST METHOD DEVELOPMENT. AND TOXICOLOGY PRACTICE TO TAKE A MORE INTELLIGENT APPROACH TO TOXICITY TESTING. ANALYSES I'M GONNA TALK BRIEFLY ABOUT ONE OF THE ALTERNATIVES ANALYSES HAVE SHOWN THAT THE DAPHNIA ARE SIMILAR TO FINISH. AND IF A BIT MORE SENSITIVE TO TOXIC MATERIALS. THE TEST IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE FISH ADULT TEST ARMED GROUPS OF DAPHNIA ARE EXPOSED TO TEST MATERIAL AND. SEVERAL DILUTIONS AND THEN. AND SEVERAL DILUTIONS AND AND THE NUMBER OF IMMOBILIZE DAPHNE ARE COUNTING AFTER TWENTY FOUR OR FORTY EIGHT HOURS. TOXIC OF A CERTAIN PERCENTAGE OF DAPHNE A FAILED TO SURVIVE. A DEATH NEAR IMPORTANT FOOD SOURCE FOR FOR ANOTHER QUANTIC ORGANISMS MAKING THE DAPHNIA TOXICITY TESTING INDICATOR OF POTENTIAL AFFECTS. OF A WASTE ON AQUATIC SYSTEMS BEYOND THE SPECIFIC SPECIES OF FISH USED IN THE LIVE FISH TO. IN ADDITION TO CONSIDERATION OF THE TWO TESTS ALTERNATIVES WE SUGGEST IMPLEMENTING A TIERED APPROACH THAT TAKES INTO ACCOUNT CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS. OF THE WASTE IN A TOWARD DETERMINE WHAT IF ANY TESTING SHOULD TAKE PLACE RATHER THAN IMMEDIATELY GOING TO THE LIVE. THIS IS VERY COMMON PRACTICE IN OTHER REGULATORY JURISDICTION. IN MY OPINION THE TWO TESTS ARE SCIENTIFICALLY APPROPRIATE AND ARE LIKELY TO BE ADAPTABLE FOR CALIFORNIA'S NEED. TO ENSURE THE PROTECTION OF AQUATIC LIFE AGAINST A RANGE OF VOLATILE LIQUID AND SOLID WASTES WHILE SAVING ANIMALS AND STATE RISK. DAFFY OUR WATER FLEAS. GOOD AFTERNOON AND THANK YOU FOR HAVING ME HERE TODAY. MY NAME IS MARLA JEFFRIES AND I AM AN ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF BIOLOGY AT TEXAS CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY IN FORT WORTH TEXAS. I'VE BEEN CONDUCTING TOXICOLOGICAL RESEARCH FOR NEARLY FIFTEEN YEARS AND OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS MUCH OF MY RESEARCH HAS BEEN DEDICATED TO EXAMINING THE UTILITY. OF THE FAT ADMIN รณ FISH EMBRYO TOXICITY TEST AS A REPLACEMENT FOR TEST METHODS THAT REQUIRE OLDER MORE DEVELOPED FISH. IN PRACTICE THE FISH EMBRYO TEST IS SIMILAR TO OTHER TESTS TYPES GROUPS OF EMBRYOS ARE EXPOSED TO SEVERAL DELUSIONS OF TEST MATERIAL. AND THE NUMBER OF EMBRYOS THAT PARISH ARE COUNTED EVERY TWENTY FOUR HOURS FOR THE DURATION OF THE TEST. I THINK OFFICIALLY OF TOXICITY TEST WAS ADOPTED BY THE OECD AND TWENTY THIRTEEN. AS AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE FISH ACUTE TOXICITY TEST A TEST SIMILAR TO THE STATIC ACUTE BIO ACID BEING USED HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO CLASSIFY HAZARDOUS WASTES. PRIOR TO THIS ADOPTION EXTENSIVE VALIDATION EFFORTS WERE UNDERTAKEN TO ENSURE THE REPRODUCIBILITY AND SENSITIVITY OF THE FISH EMBRYO TEST RELATIVE TO THE FISH ACUTE TEST. THESE EFFORTS REVEALED A STRONG CORRELATION BETWEEN THE TWO TESTS INDICATING THE POTENTIAL FOR EMBRYOS TO BE UTILIZED IN PLACE OF JUVENILE OR ADULT FETCH. I SUPPORT THIS BILL BECAUSE IT ALLOWS THE TT AS SEAT TO ASK AND ANSWER THE QUESTION OF WHETHER THESE TO TEST TYPES. WHICH INCLUDES THE FISH EMBRYO TO. TOXICITY TEST CAN MEET THE DEMANDS OF THEIR HAZARDOUS WASTE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION THAT YOU TEST OF THE POTENTIAL TO MEET THEIR NEEDS ENSURING THE PROTECTION OF ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY ENHANCING THE WELFARE OF ANIMALS UTILIZED IN THE ASSOCIATED TOXICITY. THANK YOU AND OUR FINAL WITNESS. HOLLY FOR MANY WITH WHITE HOUSE PUBLIC AFFAIRS ON BEHALF OF SOCIAL COMPASSION AND LEGISLATION THE CO SPONSOR OF SUPPORT. ALRIGHT WELL THAT WAS EASY. ANYONE ELSE ONE COME FORWARD AND SUPPORT OF THIS MEASURE PLEASE COME FORWARD NOW. OR FOREVER HOLD YOUR PEACE. OKAY IS THERE ANY OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. IF SO PLEASE COME FORWARD. NOBODY. WHILE. GOOD JOB CHAIRMAN QUIRK NO OPPOSITION. THIS IS GONNA SAVE YOUR VOICE A LITTLE BIT OKAYED SO. SINCE IT IS ONLY ME ON THE DIET IS AND I DON'T HAVE ANY FURTHER COMMENTS I'M OTHER THAN TO SAY I'M IMPRESSED DID YOUR WITNESS COME ALL THE WAY FROM TEXAS. TO TESTIFY. WELL YOU GET THE AWARD FOR TRAVELING THE FURTHEST FOR TESTIFYING TODAY. OKAY WELL I THINK THIS MAKES PERFECT SENSE AMMANAI WOULD NEVER DARE TO CHALLENGE A CHAIRMAN QUIRK ON ANYTHING SCIENTIFIC BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT WOULD HAPPEN IF I DID. AMBER THIS MAKES PRETTY PRETTY GOOD SENSE TO ME. SO I WOULD MOVE THE BILL IF I COULD BUT I CAN NOT SO WHEN THE REST OF OUR MEMBERS. ENTER THE CHAMBERS AND TAKE THEIR SEATS THEN I'LL BE HAPPY MOVE THAT BILL. WITH THAT MUCH MISTER COURT DO YOU WANT TO MOVE ON TO. YOUR ALLERGIST CLOSE I'M SORRY YOUR CLOTHES I APOLOGIZE OKAY SO WHETHER YOU ARE CONCERNED ABOUT THE DEATH OF NANO CERTAIN NOT. MANY COMMERCIAL LA ENTITIES ARE CONCERNED. BECAUSE THEIR CUSTOMERS ARE CONCERNED AND THEY WANT TO GET A LABEL. SAYS. CRUELTY ENAMEL CRUELTY FREE. SO I URGE YOU VOTE. I. THOUGHT SHE SURE WE CAN GO ON TO THE NEXT ONE. OKAY SO THEN THE NEXT ONE IS. FILE ITEM EIGHT WHICH IS AB TWO SEVEN EIGHT SEVEN. MISTER TING IS HERE SO HE IS HERE OKAY. IRATE MR TING. COME ON UP. FILE ITEM NUMBER THREE AB TWO FOUR ZERO SEVEN. AND WE HAVE A SUBCOMMITTEE RIGHT NOW IT'S JUST MEAL CHAIRMAN NOBEL THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR MISTER CHAIR. OF VERY QUICKLY AB ARE TWENTY FOUR SEVEN TASK THE SECRETARY FOR ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION TO CONVENE THE LITHIUM ION. CAR BATTERY RECYCLING ADVISORY GROUP DEVICE SUPPORT GROUP REVIEW AND ADVISE THE LEGISLATURE ON POLICIES PERTAINING TO THE RECOVERY AND RECYCLING A LITHIUM ION VEHICLE BATTERY SOLD WITH MOTOR VEHICLES. THESE POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS TO LEGISLATURE WOULD BE DUE APRIL ONE TWENTY TWENTY I KNOW OUR MINORITY LEADER MISTER DALI ALSO HAS A SIMILAR BILL. WE ARE WE'VE BEEN IN CONVERSATIONS AND SHOULD OUR BILLS BOTH BE TO SENATE WE OP SICKEN ME COMPLETELY COMMITTED. TO WORKING TOGETHER TO RESOLVE PHAM THE VERY FEW DIFFERENCES WE HAVE. AND A COMBINED EFFORT SO WE ARE ACTUALLY COMMITTED TO DOING THAT AND APPRECIATE HIM FOR. OUR REACHING OUT. HOW GREAT I'M GLAD TO HEAR THAT THANK YOU? AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A VOTE OKAY ANYONE WITNESS WITNESS. I AM A CLUB OF CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE. ARE WE CURRENTLY HAVE ABOUT FOUR HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND FIVE HUNDRED THOUSAND ELECTRIC VEHICLES ON THE ROAD OUT OF THIRTY FIVE MILLION CARS. BUT THE GOVERNOR'S EXECUTIVE ORDER IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE THAT FIVE MILLION BY TWENTY THIRTY. AND THAT THE AUTHOR OF THIS BILL HAS LEGISLATION TO TRANSITION TO ALL ELECTRIC VEHICLES BY TWENTY FORTY. SO REALLY WE HAVE A GREAT OPPORTUNITY TO GET AHEAD. ABOUT MAJOR RECYCLING ISSUE AND COME UP WITH A COHERENT STRATEGY FOR MANAGING. THE BATTERIES THAT COME WITH THESE CARS BEFORE THEY BECOME A PROBLEM. AND SO WE COMMAND AUTHOR FOR WORKING ON THIS ISSUE IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE. TACKLE IT NOW NOT WAIT UNTIL THE END OF LIFE FOR THESE VEHICLES. THANK YOU ARM ARE THERE ANY OTHER WITNESSES YOU WANT TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. OKAY ARE THERE ANY WITNESSES YOU WANT TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NOPE OKAY ON. I DON'T MISTER CHAIRMAN YOU HAVE ANY COMMENTS YOU WANT TO JUST CLOSE IT OUT FOR THEM. THANK YOU FOR AGREEING TO MAKE IT WORK WITH MISTER DALI. THE TWO OF YOU WOULD BE IN AND BE ABLE TO. I ORIGINALLY VOTE THANK YOU. AND. WE WILL OBVIOUSLY WHEN WE HAVE MORE MEMBERS MOVE THE BILL IN AND VOTE ON IT BUT THANK YOU VERY PAYING VERY MUCH PUSH. WHEN I WAS HERE. THIS OF MISTER CHAIRMAN WITH WHICH YOU LIKE TO PRESENT YOUR SECOND BILL. COMMITTEE HEARING WELL I'LL JUST START FROM MEMORY. SO ORIGINALLY HAD A BILL. WHICH. ASKED TO BAN CERTAIN LEAD WEIGHTS. BOUGHT THE INDUSTRY CAME TO ME WITH A CONCERNED. WHILE THERE IS. CERTAINLY. A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT THEY ARE LET THIS IS LEAD FISHING WEIGHTS. THERE'S CERTAINLY A LOT OF EVIDENCE THAT LEAD FISHING WEIGHTS. ARE CAUSING PROBLEMS IN PARTICULAR POPULATIONS BALLOONS IN VARIOUS AREAS. THEY WANTED TO KNOW. WHETHER OR NOT IT REALLY WOULD CAUSE A PROBLEM HERE IN CALIFORNIA. AND ALSO EXACTLY WHAT THE WEIGHT OF A FISHING WEIGHT WE. SHOULD BE LOOKING AT IF WE WERE TO BAN CERTAIN WAY TO FISHING WEIGHTS WE WERE LOOKING AT THE SMALLER WEIGHTS WHICH ARE THE ONES. THEY CAN BE EATEN BY DOCS THAT FEED ON THE BOTTOM. SO THAT I THINK THEY RAISED VALID CONCERNS. WE ARE TRYING TO FIGURE OUT EXACTLY WHAT THAT TARA WEIGHT LIMIT SHOULD BE. SO I'VE AGREED TO WORK WITH THE INDUSTRY TO DO A STUDY TO LOOK PRECISELY. AT WHAT THE RISKS ARE IN CALIFORNIA. I WILL BE ASKING THE. THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE TO APPROVE THAT AND ALSO WORKING ON THE BUDGET. AND WITH THAT. WHEN WE HAVE A CORE. CLASS FOR NINE VOTE SO YOU ARE TAKING THE AMENDMENTS IN THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEE NOT MISS CAMINO. I'M TAKING THEM AS SOON AS I CAN THERE RIGHT NOW. WE HAVE SO WILL WE'RE CHANGING MY OWN BILL TO A STUDY BALLOT CAN YOU IMAGINE THAT I'VE BEEN THERE BUT IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO. ONE MAKE SURE WE ARE CLEAR. SURE THE CHAIR TELL ME I HAD TO DO IT. HE'S PIECE. CIRCULAR LAKE VADYM AM OKAY SO DO WE HAVE ANY WITNESSES WHO WANT TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY IN SUPPORT. ANYONE WISHING TO TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION. MADAM. MADAM CHAIRWOMAN MEMBERS MARK SMITH ON BEHALF OF THE AMERICAN SPORTFISHING ASSOCIATION. THE NORTHERN CALIFORNIA GUIDES AND SPORTSMEN'S. AB VARIETY OF OTHER ORGANIZATIONS AS PART OF A LARGER COALITION WHO WILL INTRODUCE THEMSELVES COMING UP. ON NOT HARD OPPOSITION BUT I THINK WE STILL ARE IN A POSITION WHERE WE DO NOT HAVE AGREEMENT WITH THE AUTHOR ON. THE SCOPE OF THE LANGUAGE FOR THE STUDY THAT IS PROPOSED IN THIS PARTICULAR BILL. AYE WE DO RECOGNIZE THE FACT THAT. THE AUTHOR HAS AMENDED THE BILL TO ELIMINATE THE BAND AND WE ARE VERY APPRECIATIVE THAT SOMEHOW WE THINK THAT THE BAND WAS PROBABLY HAVE A PREMATURE CONVERSATION TO BE HAVING AT THIS POINT IN TIME. WE DID PROPOSE SOME LANGUAGE THAT WE FELT WOULD BE APPROPRIATE FOR A STUDY. ARE INCLUDING THE FACT THAT WE WOULD REALLY LIKE A STUDY TO LOOK AT POPULATION LEVEL AFFECTS. WE DON'T WANT TO SUGGEST DOING ANYTHING RELATIVE TO BANNING A PARTICULAR PRODUCT. IF THE INDIVIDUAL OCCURRENCES ARE SO INFREQUENT AS TO BE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT ON A POPULATION LEVEL AFFECTED SO. WE PROPOSE SOME LANGUAGE RELATIVE TO THAT THE AUTHORS PROPOSE SOME OTHER LANGUAGE AT THIS POINT IN TIME I THINK OUR COALITION WOULD LIKE TO CONTINUE WORKING WITH HIM AS THE BILL MOVES FORWARD TO REACH AGREEMENT ON WHAT THAT LANGUAGE SHOULD LOOK LIKE SO. A SOFT OPPOSE AT THIS POINT IN TIME BUT AGAIN DO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHORS OFFICE AND THE STAFF FOR WORKING WITH US ON THIS ISSUE THANK YOU. ALRIGHT THANK YOU NEXT WITNESS A THANK YOU. GEORGE OSBORNE REPRESENTING THE CALIFORNIA SPORTFISHING LEAGUE. AND THE CO SIDE FISHING CLUB GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR OF YOU HAVING A GOOD DAY. MADAM VICE CHAIR AND. THE MEMBERS. FOR HER OF HER HERE. FIRST LET ME SAY WE RESPECT THE AUTHOR. AND HIS CONCERN FOR WILDLIFE. WE SHARE THAT CONCERN. A SPORTING LORS BY THE VERY NATURE A CONSERVATIONIST WHO APPRECIATE THE RULES GOVERNING OUR SPORT. TO ENSURE THE FUTURE GENERATIONS OF ANGLERS OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN. I HAVE A HEALTHY POPULATION OF WILDLIFE INCLUDING FISH TO ENJOY AND TAKE. I TO US IT IS VERY SIMPLE. NO FISH MEANS NO FUTURE ANGLERS. THE GREEN CHEMISTRY INITIATIVE PASSED OUT OF THE LEGISLATURE IN TWO THOUSAND EIGHT IN A CHARGE THE DEPARTMENT OF TOXIC SUBSTANCE CONTROL WITH IDENTIFYING. AND PRIORITIZING CHEMICALS OF CONCERN IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS. AND THE BEST POSSIBLE ALTERNATIVES AND TO TAKE REGULATORY ACTION TO BEST PROTECT PEOPLE. AND THE ENVIRONMENT. THE LEGISLATURE TOOK THAT ACTION IN PART TO TAKE POLITICS OUT OF THIS DISCUSSION AND LET SCIENCE BE THE GUY. I FIRST ENGAGED AN ISSUE OF LEAD FISHING TACKLE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN WHEN DGSE PUT LED FINISH FISHING TACKLE. AT THE FRONT OF THE LINE ON THEIR PRIORITY PRODUCTS LIST. MY CLIENTS OPPOSED TO BEING PLACED ON THAT LIST. AMONG OTHER REASONS BECAUSE THERE IS NO SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH. DONE IN CALIFORNIA THAT INDICATED THAT LEAD WEIGHTS AND SINKERS. WE'RE CAUSING ANY PROBLEMS IN CALIFORNIA. AFTER A GREAT OUTCRY FROM RECREATIONAL ENGLAND COMMUNITY. DGSE PUT THE ISSUE OF LEAD FISHING TACKLE AT THE BACK OF THE LINE. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN STARTED OUT AS A BAND ON LEAD AND FISHING WEIGHTS AND SINKERS EVEN THOUGH WE'RE STILL HAS BEEN. NO RESEARCH IN CALIFORNIA THAT POINTS TO LEAD FISHING WEIGHTS AND SINKERS IS HAVING A NEGATIVE IMPACT THAN ANY WILDLIFE POPULATION. IN CALIFORNIA. AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN IS A BAN ON LEAD WEIGHTS AND SINKERS. ALSO GENERATED NOW OUTPOURING OF OPPOSITION AS YOU CAN SEE FROM YOUR ANALYSIS AS WELL AS THE FIFTY FIVE HUNDRED CALIFORNIA ANGLERS WHO SIGN THE ONLINE PETITION. OPPOSING THE BAN. IN OUR DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR HE BROACHED THE IDEA OF A RESEARCH STUDY. TO IDENTIFY WHERE PROBLEM MAY EXIST IN CALIFORNIA TO WILDLIFE. BECAUSE THE THE USE OF LEAD WEIGHTS AND SINKERS. WHAT WE DO NOT OBJECT TO SUCH A RESEARCH STUDY THE PARAMETERS OF STUDY MUST BE WELL DEFINED? PAN AND LIMITED WE BELIEVE TO THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON WILDLIFE POPULATIONS FROM THE USE OF LEAD WEIGHTS AND SINKERS. THAT'S WHY WE CONTINUE O OPPOSE AB TWENTY SEVEN EIGHTY SEVEN AS IT IS PROPOSED TO BE AMENDED HEARING COMMITTEE TODAY. WE OPPOSE YET ANOTHER UNFUNDED MANDATE UNDER DEPARTMENT FISH AND WILDLIFE. AND BELIEVE IT'S A SOURCE OF FUNDING SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE BILL. STUDY SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE IMPACTS ON WILDLIFE POPULATIONS WHERE SUCH AN IMPACT MAY OCCUR. WE BELIEVE THAT THE STUDY SHOULD BE CONDUCTED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE AND NOT CONTRACTED OUT. TO WHAT MAY BE ULTIMATELY THE LOWEST BIDDER. THE DEPARTMENT HAS AN OUTSTANDING SCIENTIST IN HOUSE. WHO WITH THE APPROPRIATE FUNDING COULD MOST EFFECTIVELY STUDY THE IMPACT OF LEAD AND FISHING WEIGHTS? AND SINKERS ON WILDLIFE POPULATIONS. THAT'S WHAT THEY DO. THE ISSUE OF HUMAN HEALTH WE BELIEVE WOULD BE BETTER LEFT TO ANOTHER LEGISLATIVE VEHICLE. AS A DEPARTMENT OF FISH AND WILDLIFE IS ALREADY RELATED TO US. THAT HUMAN HEALTH ISSUES ARE BEYOND THEIR JURISDICTION. WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WILLINGNESS TO MEET AND DIALOGUE WITH US. WE HOPE TO CONTINUE THESE DISCUSSIONS WITH THE AUTHOR TO EVENTUALLY COME TO AN AGREEMENT ON THE PARAMETERS OF THE SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH STUDY. AND I THINK ONE OF THE. MOST IMPORTANT FACTORS IS TO HELP THE AUTHOR IDENTIFY THE SOURCE OF FUNDING WE'RE HAPPY TO WORK WITH THEM A GOING FORWARD ON AT. A BUT FOR NOW WE MUST OPPOSE THE AUTHORS PROPOSED STUDY LANGUAGE THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND WE'RE HAPPY TO. TAKE ANY QUESTIONS. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY ONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NOW OKAY SO I ARE THERE ANY QUESTIONS FROM. WE DO WELL. SNEAKING IT FROM THE BACK TO LINE UP. NAME. ORGANIZATION IN YOUR POSITION AT REGULARLY WITHOUT CHAMBER WERE ALSO IN OPPOSITION TO THE PROPOSED AMENDED LANGUAGE AND. I THINK YOU. NO ONE ELSE GOOD AFTERNOON CAPTAIN WENT REPRESENTING COMPANIES SPORTSMEN'S LOBBY OUTDOOR SPORTS WAS COALITION AND SPIKELET INTERNATIONAL IN THE SAME POSITION AS THE WITNESS THANK YOU. SO ANNOUNCEMENT THE CONGRESSIONAL SPORTS FOUNDATION ALSO. STRELA SENTIMENTS OF THE WITNESS. AND THE UP AND BREAK LEAD FILTHY WITH APEX GRUPA ON BEHALF OF THE. NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MANUFACTURERS AND UP CALIFORNIA'S. YUP BROKERS ASSOCIATION. THE MARINE RECREATION ASSOCIATION WE ARE ALSO POST. ALRIGHT ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION. NO OKAY SOBERING APPEARED TO DIS FOR DISCUSSION. NOW NOTHING OKAY. WELL I I THINK THAT. THE OPPOSITION BRINGS UP SOME VALID POINTS I CERTAINLY UNDERSTAND YOUR CONCERN. I THINK CHAIRMAN QUIRK. IT'S BEEN MY EXPERIENCE HE'S PRETTY GOOD ABOUT WORKING WITH THE OPPOSITION TO MAKE SURE THAT I'M EVERYBODY'S HAPPY WITH THIS IN THE AND. THE AMENDMENTS ARE THAT THIS WILL TURN INTO A STUDY BILL WHICH I ASSUME YOU WILL WORK CLOSELY THROUGHOUT THIS PROCESS SO THAT IT IS THEM. ADEQUATELY FUNDED. INAPPROPRIATELY FOCUSED ON ON WHERE IT SHOULD BE SO HOW WE DO NOT HAVE A QUORUM SO WE CANNOT VOTE RIGHT NOW WE CAN'T EVEN MOVE THE BILL RIGHT NOW. BUT THERE MAY BE. FURTHER DISCUSSION LATER BUT AT THIS POINT GENTLEMEN I THINK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY. AND. MISTER QUIRK IF YOU STILL HAVE A LOANS I WELCOME. I AGREE WE HAVE TO. TO GET MONEY IN THE BUDGET OTHERWISE HE DON'T EXPECT TO GET THROUGH APPROPRIATIONS. ARM SO WILL WILL DEFINITELY BE TRYING TO GET MONEY IN THE BUDGET FOR THIS. AND I ALSO WANT TO MAKE SURE I HAVE A STUDY THAT MAKES A GOOD CASE. AND SO WE'RE GONNA HAVE TO TAKE A LOOK AT THAT IF MY TIME IS TOO SHORT AND IT DOESN'T COME UP WITH A. DEFINITIVE ANSWER THEN WE WILL NEED MORE TIME BUT. BUT LET'S JUST WORK ON THIS OVER THE NEXT FEW WEEKS AND. BILL IS GOING TO APPROPRIATIONS HOPEFULLY BEFORE IT'S OUT COLD LA WE CAN DECIDE ON WHERE WE'RE GOING THANK YOU OKAY. THANK YOU THANK YOU GENERAL. THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY I REALIZE IT'S A LITTLE ANTI CLIMACTIC ALWAYS HOPE VOTE I APOLOGIZE BUT WE THE PEOPLE HERE. MISTER MURATSUCHI DO YOU. THE WAITRESS COMING. MISTER SOUNDS HERE THE AREAS. ASSEMBLYMAN STONE COME ON UP. M. FILE ITEM NUMBER TEN AB TWO NINE THREE FOUR. THANK YOU MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS. AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY FOUR IS A BILL THAT WOULD FACILITATE. THE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS WHO ARE BE WILL BE NECESSARY FOR GOING OUT LOOKING INTO OUR COMMUNITIES AND FINDING LEAD PAINT THAT'S THERE. THERE WAS A RECENT. SUPREME COURT DECISION THAT AWARDED TEN COUNTIES. THAT SETTLED THE A A SETTLEMENT THEY GAVE THEM A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY FROM THE LEAD PAINT COMPANIES BECAUSE OF THE TOXIC MATERIALS IT'S IN A LOT OF PEOPLE'S HOUSES. AND THERE'S NOT CURRENTLY THE AND ENOUGH INSPECTORS ACROSS ALL OF THE COUNTIES WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS FACILITATE THAT. THE STATE WORKING WITH THE COUNTIES TO ENSURE THAT THERE ARE APPROPRIATE NUMBER OF INSPECTORS OUT IN OUR COMMUNITY SO WE CAN GET THE WORK DONE WE GET THE MONEY SPENT WE CAN GET. THE DANGEROUS SITUATION AND A LOT OF THESE HOMES REMEDIATED AND WITH THAT I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE I AM HAPPY TO TAKE THE AMENDMENTS THAT WERE. OFFERED IN THE COMMITTEE ANALYSIS AND I THINK THAT REALLY HELPS. TO COORDINATE THE ISSUE WITH RESPECT TO THAT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT THE STATE GOVERNMENT LOCAL GOVERNMENTS TO ENSURE THAT WE HAVE A PROCESS WHERE WE CAN GET THIS DONE AS EXPEDITIOUSLY. AS POSSIBLE. WONDERFUL AND YOU ARE HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT YES JENNY LAM FROM THE COUNTY COUNSEL'S OFFICE IN SANTA CLARA COUNTY. THE COUNTY SANTA CLARA IS PLEASED TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY NINE THIRTY FOR ALMOST TWENTY YEARS AGO OUR OFFICE FILED ITS LANDMARK CASE TO HOLD FORMER LED PETE MANUFACTURERS ACCOUNTABLE. FOR PROMOTING ON A WIDESPREAD BASIS THE USE OF LEAD PAINT IN HOMES DESPITE KNOWING THAT THEIR PRODUCT WAS TOXIC AND HARMFUL TO CHILDREN. JOINING INSIGHTS IN THIS FIGHT WERE NINE OTHER CITIES IN COUNTY INCLUDING ALAMEDA COUNTY LOS ANGELES COUNTY. CITY OF OAKLAND MONTEREY COUNTY CITY OF SAN DIEGO SAN FRANCISCO SAN THEM CEMETERY KENNY SOLANO COUNTY IN VENTURA COUNTY. HAVING NOW WANNA HISTORIC JUDGMENT AGAINST THE FORMER LEAD PAINT MANUFACTURERS WE NOW NEED YOUR HELP TO IMPLEMENT THE COURT'S DECISION IN SHORT LEAD SAFE HOUSING FOR THE CHILDREN OF OUR STATE. EVERY YEAR THOUSANDS OF CHILDREN ARE POISONED BY LEAD ACROSS THE STATE. DIDN'T FROM TWO THOUSAND TEN THROUGH TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN THE LAST FIVE YEARS FOR WHICH THERE IS DATA AVAILABLE JUST IMITATING JURISDICTIONS THAT I'VE NAMED ALMOST FORTY THOUSAND CHILDREN WORK TESTED POSITIVE FOR LEAD POISONING. THE EFFECTS OF LEAD POISONING ARE PERMANENT AND IRREVERSIBLE SO EVERYONE OF THOSE CHILDREN IS IRREVERSIBLY AFFECTED FOR LIFE. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION REPORTS THAT AT HIGH LEVELS OF EXPOSURE LEAD POISONING CAN RESULT IN DEATH COMA. AT AND CONVULSIONS CHILDREN WHO SURVIVE SEVERE LEAD POISONING MAY BE LEFT WITH MENTAL RETARDATION BEHAVIORAL DISORDERS. AND AT LOWER LEVELS OF EXPOSURE. AT WHICH THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS SYMPTOMS LEAD CAN AFFECT CHILDREN'S BRAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN RESERVE RESULTING IN REDUCED IQ BEHAVIORAL CHANGES SUCH AS REDUCED ATTENTION SPAN AND REDUCED EDUCATIONAL ATTAINMENT. THE EXPERTS ALL AGREE THAT LEAD PAINT IS THE PREDOMINANT SOURCE OF LEAD POISONING FOR CHILDREN. LEAD PAINT DETERIORATES LIKE ALL PAINS AND CONTAMINATES THE AIR THE SOIL THE FLOORS AND OTHER SURFACES IN HOMES DURING TRIAL ONE OF OUR EXPERTS TESTIFIED. THAT IT THE INJECTION OF A PINK SHIP THE SIZE OF A PERIOD AT THE END OF A SENTENCE IS ENOUGH TO CAUSE. LEAD POISONING THAT WOULD PERMANENTLY DAMAGED OPERATE A YOUNG WITH ALL DUE RESPECT THE BILL. IT'S ABOUT MORE RESPECTED MORE INSPECTORS. SO I WE DON'T NEED TO HEAR I THINK A LOT MORE ABOUT LAND I THINK THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN AGREE ON. I IT REALLY IS ABOUT THE ONLY THE INSPECTORS YES AND THE JUDGMENT CREATES A HUGE DEMAND AND AN OPPORTUNITY TO PREVENT CHILDHOOD LEAD POISONING FOR THE TEN JURISDICTIONS IN OUR STATE AND INVOLVED IN OUR CASE. AND OVER A VERY SHORT OPERATE AT THE OVER A VERY SHORT TIME FRAME IS THERE THIS OPPORTUNITY TO DEBATE LEAD PAINT AND I JURISDICTIONS. AND SO WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS BILL AND IF IT DIDN'T THE SHORTAGE OF CERTIFIED WORKERS IS CLEAR AT THE NEED IS URGENT AND WE. AND WE WOULD HOPE THAT THE STATE TAKES AND WHATEVER ACTIONS IT CAN TO INCREASE AND EXPAND THE WORK FORCE. THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES TO SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. COME FORWARD. O. WE HAVE A QUORUM NOW SO WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE THEIR ALL. BEFORE THEY ESCAPE. QUIRK.

SO DO WE WANT TO HAVE. WE HAVE. MISTER MURATSUCHI PRESENT I. ALRIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH MISTER CHAIR MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE I. I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE CHAIR THE COMMITTEE STAFF FIRST FOR WORKING GO ON THIS BILL AND WE LIKE TO ACCEPT THE AMENDMENTS THAT'S OUTLINED IN THE NLCS. BY THIS BILL A. B. TWENTY EIGHT SIXTEEN REQUIRES THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION. TWO ONE CONDUCTING EVALUATION OF THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT OF TWO THOUSAND. BUT TO SEE WHERE WE'RE AT IN TERMS OF THE. THAT DID THE STATUS OF SCHOOL DISTRICTS IN IMPLEMENTING THIS ACT. AND SECOND TO RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE WHETHER ONE OR MORE PESTICIDES SHOULD BE RESTRICTED OR PROHIBITED. BY I FIRST BECAME INVOLVED IN THIS ISSUE. WHEN. NINE ISSUE WAS RAISED THAT MY OWN DAUGHTERS TO A PUBLIC SCHOOL. ARE WHERE. THEY USE OF PESTICIDES THAT MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL OF SCHOOL FIELDS AND I WAS SUSPENDED AFTER NUMEROUS. I COMPLAINTS OF CHILDREN HAVING GO. I AND SKIN IRRITATION A BRIEFING PROBLEMS. AND AND SO THERE WAS A. A OUR A LOCAL UPROAR. IN MY SCHOOL DISTRICT. AROUND THE USE OF PESTICIDES THAT ARE OUR DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL AT MY DAUGHTER'S SCHOOL. WELL AS WE ALL KNOW PESTICIDES CAN CAUSE A VARIETY OF HEALTH PROBLEMS ACCORDING TO THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENT PROTECTION AGENCY. THAT'S ASIDE EXPOSURE CAN CAUSE DIZZINESS NAUSEA A TO SERIOUS LONG TERM NEUROLOGICAL AND REPRODUCTIVE DISORDERS. FURTHERMORE THE NATIONAL ACADEMY OF SCIENCES HAVE REPORTED THAT. CHILDREN IN PARTICULAR ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO CHEMICALS. THAN ADULTS AN ESTIMATE THAT UP TO PERCENT OF LIFETIME PARA PESTICIDE EXPOSURE. OCCURS DURING THE FIRST FIVE YEARS OF LIFE. IN A RECENT COURT RULING CALIFORNIA CAN NOW LISTS. BLOG LIKE THE STATE COMMENTED HERBICIDE SUCH AS ROUNDUP AS A LIKELY CARCINOGEN. UNDER PROPOSITION SIXTY FIVE. MORE MORE EVIDENCE IS FINDING IT PESTICIDES CAN BE DANGEROUS ESPECIALLY TO CHILDREN. AS I INDICATED EARLIER. THIS BILL WILL PROTECT OUR CHILDREN BY LOOKING AT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT IN OUR SCHOOLS. A WHICH IS NOT BEEN EVALUATED SINCE TWO THOUSAND TEN. TO ENSURE PROPER IMPLEMENTATION AND TO CONSIDER CERTAIN PATHS SITES THAT SHOULD. BE BANNED OR RESTRICTED. I HAVE TWO WITNESSES IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AND. ELECT FIRST TRIED OVER THE DOCTOR MICHELLE PARA. A PEDIATRICIAN WHO'S BEEN. WORKING ON THIS ISSUE FOR MANY YEARS. ASSEMBLYMAN A THANK YOU BY CHAIRPERSON QUIRK AND ASSEMBLYMEMBERS I'M GLAD TO BE HERE TODAY. I'VE BEEN A BEDOUIN PEDIATRICIAN FOR NEARLY FOUR DECADES AND ON THE FRONTLINE PEDIATRICIAN WHICH MEANS MY HANDS GOES ON PATIENTS AND I ACTUALLY. EXAMINE PATIENTS AND WORK IN THE CLIPPINGS A CLINIC SETTING I RECENTLY WROTE THIS BOOK WITH A COLLEAGUE WHICH I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU. A ASSEMBLYMAN QUIRK REGARDING THE HEALTH OF OUR CHILDREN A WITH THE FOCUS ON QUITE THE STATE WHICH IS MY AREA OF EXPERTISE WHICH I'VE BEEN STUDYING FOR ABOUT TWELVE YEARS. THIS BOOK IS BASED ON MY PATIENTS MOSTLY MARIN COUNTY AND THE SOME OF THE SURROUNDING AREAS. AND AS YOU ALREADY KNOW MARIN COUNTY IS THE EIGHTH WEALTHIEST COUNTY IN THE U. S. SO I'M TAKING CARE VERY AFFLUENT CHILDREN WHO HAVE ACCESS TO MEANS. NOW THERE ARE EIGHT COUNTIES IN THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA THAT DON'T HAVE ACCESS SUCH AS FRESNO MERCED CURRENT TO OUR IMPERIAL MERCED ON LAKE IT CETERA. AND THESE COUNTIES HAVE HIGH RATES OF A SPRING BOTH IN THE AGRICULTURAL FIELD. PARENTS BRINGING THE SPRING HOME TO CHILDREN AND THE CHILDREN ARE ADDITIONALLY BEING SPRAYED AT SCHOOL. THIS POPULATION IS MOSTLY LATINO AND THEY HAVE SOME OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF ILLNESS IN THE STATE AND WE HAVE GOOD SCIENTIFIC DATA SUPPORTING THAT. SO THEN THERE BECOMES AN ISSUE ABOUT OR CULTURAL AND EDUCATIONAL JUSTICE AS WELL WHICH IS ONE OF MY CONCERNS I BRING FOR WHICH THIS COMMITTEE. WHEN WE LOOK BACK AT THE WORK OF ASSEMBLY MARTUCCI AND WHAT HAPPENED IN HIS CHILD'S SCHOOL WITH THAT WE KNOW THAT EVEN SINGLE SPRING OF ACUTE SPRING CAN CAUSE LONG TERM SQUARELY IN PARTICULAR CANCERS. CANCERS TAKE A LONG TIME DEVELOP AT AS UP AS HIGH AS TWO DECADES. SO NOBODY WILL ABLE TO OF ANY OF THOSE KIDS WHO WERE SPRAYED GO ON TO DEVELOP NON HODGKINS LYMPHOMA WHEN THE HIGHEST CANCERS IN OF PEOPLE TODAY AS WELL AS YOUR DOG. THEN NOBODY IS GOING TO BE ABLE TO LOOK AT THIS RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THESE CANCERS AND. EARLIER SPRING AND NOBODY'S LOOKING AT THAT DATA BETWEEN PREVIOUS PRAYING AND PRESENT. SO THERE IS NOTHING GOING ON THERE. THE WE WERE BEFORE THE EDUCATION COMMITTEE THEY MADE REGARDING LEAST TOXIC. PESTICIDES TO BE USED IN CHILDREN'S SCHOOLS AND WE HAVE PUT FORWARD TO THIS COMMITTEES LEAST TOXIC EXPERT ON PESTICIDES THAT CAN BE USE THAT HAVE BEEN USED SUCCESSFULLY IN IRVINE COUNTY. WAS A TREMENDOUS OF REDUCTION IN COSTS AND WATER USAGE UP TO TWENTY PERCENT AND BEAUTIFUL GREEN FIELDS DELIVER IT I'M I APOLOGIZE OF INTERRUPTING YOU BUT IT THAT THE. COMMITTEE POLICY IS TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH ARM IF YOU'D LIKE TO GIVE YOUR TIME TO HER SHE'S WELCOME TO GO ON FOR ANOTHER TWO MINUTES IF NOT. PERHAPS YOU CAN JUST CLOSE AND THEN THE NEXT WITNESS COULD TELL ALLOW ME TO CLOSE AND AND I. UP IS TO BE QUICK OKAY SO WHAT I'M ASKING THIS COMMITTEE AND REGARDING THE EDUCATION COMMITTEES OUR RECOMMENDATION FOR VALUE TO PROCESS THEY DON'T HAVE ANY HEALTH PROVIDERS LOOKING AT THIS EVALUATION SO THERE'S NOBODY REALLY MONITORING THE HEALTH OF CHILDREN. AND THE EFFECT OF CHEMICAL SPRAYING AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF A KID GETS AN ASTHMA ATTACK AFTER SPRAY NO ONE'S PUTTING THOSE PIECES TOGETHER I CAN ASSURE YOU. PEDIATRICIANS ARE ALSO NOT LOOKING AT THE EFFECT OF ENVIRONMENTAL TOXICANTS AND HEALTH AND ARE NOT TRAINED TO DO SO NOR ARE THEY DOING ANY LABORATORY TESTING ON THIS AS WELL. SO I COME TO THIS COMMITTEE WITH THE REQUEST HERE'S THE ASK THAT THIS COMMITTEE HELP ME TO DO MY JOB TO TAKE CARE OF CHILDREN ON THE FRONTLINE. THAT'S MY ASK WHETHER YOU CAN HELP ME DO MY JOB. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IN THE NEXT WITNESS YOU HAVE ABOUT A MINUTE AND HALF. I'M DIANE EVERYDAY WITH THE CALIFORNIA GUILD WARS STATEWIDE. ORGANIZATION A LOT OF. AGRICULTURE FOCUS AND ENVIRONMENTAL FOCUS WERE FRATERNAL GROUPS. AND WE SUPPORT STRONGLY OF THE MISSION OF ASSEMBLYMAN MURATSUCHI IN THIS BILL TO REDUCE EXPOSURE OF CHILDREN IN CALIFORNIA TO PESTICIDES. WE WE KNOW OF. DISTRICTS THAT HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE EXPOSED WE HAVE FRIENDS THAT HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE EXPOSED WE KNOW THAT THERE IS THE SCIENCE IT EXISTS IN DEMONSTRATED NONTOXIC IRVINE. AS A DUCT PARA MENTIONED TO TREAT. A PEST PROBLEMS WITH NONTOXIC INTERVENTIONS WE ASK FOR A LEAST TOXIC FIRST POLICY. FOR OF THE A HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT PROVISIONS RELATED TO INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT THAT WOULD HELP. AND WE HOPE THE COMMITTEE WOULD MAKE SOMETHING THAT WOULD BE A. OF AT LEAST A PARTIAL FIX WE WILL I KNOW YOU WANT INTERMENT INCREMENTAL. BUT WE DO SOMETHING TO HELP CHILDREN AND REDUCE THEIR EXPOSURE TO CHILDREN TO PESTICIDES THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO COME FOREIGN SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD STEP ON UP TO THE MICROPHONE. GOOD AFTERNOON DANA GORMAN REPRESENTING CALIFORNIA HEALTH COALITION ADVOCACY. IN FULL SUPPORT OF THE BILL AND ALSO ENCOURAGE YOU TO ADOPT. THE AMENDMENTS OFFERED BY CALIFORNIA KILLED THINK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THE BILL. NO. OKAY IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL PLEASE COME FORWARD. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS NICKEL COMMUNITY ON BEHALF OF THE HOUSEHOLD AND COMMERCIAL PRODUCTS ASSOCIATION OUT WHILE WE CERTAINLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS TAKEN ON ASSEMBLY EDUCATION WHICH A LIMITED THIS BILL THAT WOULD OF I'M FULLY UP BEYOND PESTICIDE USE AYE IN IN SCHOOLS WITH SOME. AYE EXCEPTIONS WE DO STILL BELIEVE THAT THE CURRENT BILL IS UNNECESSARY ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PESTICIDE REGULATION IN THE UNITED STATES ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY. PERFORMS A THOROUGH REVIEW OF THESE PRODUCTS BEFORE THEY'RE REGISTERED AND ALLOWED TO BE USED IN THE STATE. AND THEY ALSO ALWAYS HAVE THE ABILITY TO A REVIEW AND EVALUATE THESE PRODUCTS CONTINUOUSLY AND IF THEY FIND THAT THERE'S ANY POTENTIAL FOR HARM AYE THEY CAN. I APPLY RESTRICTIONS UP MORE COMPLETELY BEYOND THESE PRODUCTS SO. THE AUTHORITIES ALREADY THERE IDEA ALSO AM CONCERNED IT MIGHT NOT BE THE MOST EFFICIENT USE OF RESOURCES. TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT TO EVALUATE ALL OF THESE. PRODUCT THERE'S AN AND NUMBER OF PRODUCTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY ALLOWED TO BE USED IN OUR SCHOOLS AND RECOMMEND TO THE LEGISLATURE WHAT SHOULD BE BANNED WHEN THEY ALREADY HAVE THAT AUTHORITY SO. I WE ARE NEUTRAL ON THE ASPECT OF THE BILL THAT. DIRECT DPR TO A VALUE WITH HOW THE HEALTHY SCHOOLS ACT IS WORKING ON AND WE DO SUPPORT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT. STATE OF THINKING. THANK YOU. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WHO WANTS TO COME FORWARD. NOPE. OKAY THEN WE WILL BRING IN APPEAR TO THE DIETS FOR. COMMENTS QUESTIONS. SECOND. OKAY NO COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS WHAT I HAVE A COUPLE. SO. DOESN'T DP ARE ALREADY HAVE THE AUTHORITY TO BAN CERTAIN PESTICIDES. WELL WE WANTED TO SPECIFICALLY. HAVE THE DP OUR REVIEW THAT THAT SIDE SAID. AS TO THE. POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACTS RATE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS. ARM IN ORIGINALLY. MY BILL AS INDICATED BY THE OPPOSITION WAS TO BAN ALL. PESTICIDES ADD TO THE SCHOOLS ARM. GIVEN THAT. IT FOR EXAMPLE. DOG LIFE STATE A ONE OF THE MOST. CONTROVERSIAL AND COMMONLY USED HERBICIDES. COMMONLY KNOWN AS ROUNDUP. HAS NOT BEEN BANNED BY. THE DEPARTMENT. SO WE WANTED TO. PROVIDE DATA. FURTHER AMMUNITION TO THE DEPARTMENT TO. SPECIFICALLY EVALUATE. POTENTIAL HEALTH IMPACTS AND AND HOW. THE IPM. PROGRAMS ARE BEING. APPLIED WHETHER THEY ARE IN FACT BEING APPLIED AT AT SCHOOL DISTRICTS. THROUGHOUT THE STATE. TO. GIVE US MORE INFORMATION NOW ON HOW WE'RE DOING AND TO MAKE A SPECIFIC RECOMMENDATIONS AS TO WHETHER CLOCK STATE OR ANY OTHER PET SITE SHOULD BE BANNED. SO I GUESS IT'S IT'S TWO PARTS ONE IS TO EVALUATE. ON THE EFFECTS OF LEGISLATION WAS PREVIOUSLY PASSED RIGHT WITH THAT INTEGRATED PEST MANAGEMENT PLAN. AND THEN THE SECOND PART WOULD BE TO IDENTIFY WHICH PESTICIDES. THEY THINK SHOULD BE BANNED IN RATHER THAN DOING THAT THEMSELVES THEY WOULD BRING IT TO THE LEGISLATURE. TO. THAT'S ARKWRIGHT IT WOULD ADD THAT THIS BILL CALLS FOR THE DPR TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO THE LEGISLATURE AS TO WHETHER ONE OR MORE. PESTICIDES SHOULD BE TODAY SO. HERE'S MY CONCERN WITH THIS BILL BECAUSE RIGHT I HAVE KIDS AT SCHOOL TOO SO. I'D DEFINITELY SHARE THE CONCERN OF THEM GOING TO SCHOOL AND PLAYING IN THE FIELD. MY BOYS RIGHT NOW ARE PLAYING FLAG FOOTBALL IN P. E. AND THEY'RE ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE GRASS. SO I GET IT YOU KNOW YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR KIDS COMING HOME WITH ANY STORE SORTS OF REACTIONS NAM. BUT MY CONCERN IS THAT THE LEGISLATURE IS BEING ASKED TO STEP IN AND DO THE JOB OF DP ARE WHICH IS SUPPOSED TO BE. THAT THEY IDENTIFY THEM THE PESTICIDES OR CHEMICALS THAT SHOULD BE BANNED BECAUSE THEN I FEEL. THAT WE'RE GOING TO GET ON THE ROAD OF. THE LEGISLATURE BEING LOBBIED TO TO BAN THIS TO ALLOW THAT WHICH CAN GET VERY MESSY AND REALLY SHOULDN'T. BE SOMETHING THAT WE ARE DECIDING ON THAT'S WHY WE HAVE DP ARE GREAT IS WE PUT IT IN THEIR HANDS AND SAY OKAY THIS IS YOUR JOB YOUR YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES. AND YOU NEED NOT THEY'RE NOT DOING THAT THEN PERHAPS WE NEED TO RE EVALUATE. HOW THEY'RE DOING THEIR JOB OR WHAT AUTHORITY THEY HAVE BUT THAT'S MY CONCERN? WHICH AND I'M SURE YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S IN WHERE WE STEPPING OVER THE LINE. IN AND WHAT THE LEGISLATURE'S AUTHORITY. SHOULD BE IN CASES LIKE THIS. WELL AND AND IN RESPONSE AYE YEAH AYE. HERE WHICH SANG OF I I THINK IT'S A. YOU KNOW IT IT WOULD BE. I BELIEVE A MORE THOUGHTFUL APPROACH IF THE. THE SCIENTISTS AND EXPERTS AT THE DPR MAKE THE RECOMMENDATIONS AND THEN WE CAN DECIDE. WHETHER IN FACT HIM IS HE TAKE THE NEXT STEP OF OF BANNING THE PEST SIDE. AND. YOU KNOW THE VIEW WHEN I HAVE KIDS PLAYING ON THESE FIELDS I I THINK IT'S NOT JUST. VIA THE THE SKINNER AYE IRRITATIONS THAT WE'RE CONCERNED ABOUT BUT WHAT YOU DON'T LIKE LIKE TO SAY. THE WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION HAS A. DESIGNATED AS A. AS THE COURT CARCINOGEN. AND. WE DON'T WANT. OUR KIDS TO BE EXPOSED TO CANCER CAUSING CHEMICALS AND SO I THINK THIS IS A RESPONSIBLE LOWER. I EFFORT TO TO FIRST TO. TAKE BEYOND THAT TO HAVE THE DPR EVALUATE. YOU KNOW THE STATUS OF A PATH SIDE MANAGEMENT AT OUR SCHOOLS AND AND AND TO DO. PACIFIC WE MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS SO THAT WE CAN DECIDE WHETHER TO TAKE ACTION ON. HAVE YOU BY ANY CHANCE HAD ANY CONVERSATIONS WITH ANYONE IT DPR ABOUT THE FACT THAT. THERE ARE SOME PESTICIDES DID YOU KNOW YOU HAVE AND OTHER PARENTS HAVE CONCERNS WITH THAT ARE STILL ON THE LIST. OF. USES THAT ARE ALLOWED. I BUT I HAVE NOT TO HAD DIRECT CONVERSATIONS I KNOW MY STAFF HAS BUT TO. AGAIN THERE THIS BILL WOULD ALLOW THE P. R. TO MAKE RECOMMENDATIONS TO US AS TO WHETHER OR NOT. A WE SHOULD BE CONSIDERING BANNING THOSE SPECIFIES THAT YOU'RE FOR INTO. OKAY WELL IT SOUNDS LIKE YOU ARE FRUSTRATED WITH DP OURS LACK OF. ACTION. M. MIGHT BE A WAY YOU DON'T HAVE TO YOU KNOW. SAY THAT YOURSELF WHICH IS HOW I SEE IT BUT MIGHT BE. THE APPROPRIATE WAY TO CATEGORIZE IT. I JUST. I AGREE WITH. WHAT YOU'RE SAYING THAT WE SHOULD BE VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE USE OF SOME OF THESE CHEMICALS MY PROBLEM IS? PUTTING IT IN THE LEGISLATURE'S HANDS I THINK THERE SHOULD BE MORE PUT PRESSURE PLOT APPLIED TO DPR. TO DO WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN TASKED WITH DOING RATHER THEY AND. KEEP THEM IN PLACE BUT FOR THE LEGISLATURE TO TAKE ON THEIR RESPONSIBILITY THERE'S NO POINT HAVING THEM THERE THAT ARE GOING TO DO THEIR JOB. SELL I THINK I'M GONNA HAVE TO. ABSTAINED FROM VOTING ON THIS ONE AND MAYBE YOU KNOW THERE ARE SOME CHANGES MADE ALONG THE WAY. WERE ACT OR I COULD LOOK DOWN THE ROAD SUPPORT IT BUT ALBUM. THIS JUST CAUSES ME SOME CONCERN WITH THE WITH THE PROCESS NOT THE CONCEPT THAT THE PROCESS ALTHOUGH. PUMP I THINK WE'D A MOTION AND A SECOND MISTER CHAIRMAN DID YOU HAVE A CLOSING COMMENT YOU WOULD LIKE TO MAKE YES WELL WHY DON'T YOU. DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE FIRST I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR. OKAY ARM FIRST OF ALL THERE'S NOTHING THAT WOULD STOP DPR FROM TOMORROW BANNING SOMETHING AND THERE'S NOTHING IN THE BILL THAT WOULD CHANGE THAT. SO. IT. ASK DERIVE OF. SO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND RATE SO. LET'S GO AHEAD AND TAKE ROLE. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER NINE.

BY EXPANDING THE STATE WATER BOARD TO AUTHORITY TO REQUIRE A CONSOLIDATION OF. SMALL WATER SYSTEMS WHICH LAST AND FIFTEEN CONNECTIONS SO I'M TALKING ABOUT REALLY REALLY SMALL. WATER SYSTEMS THEY ARE A CONSISTENTLY EXPERIENCE IN POOR WATER QUALITY. IT IS HARD TO BELIEVE THAT THERE ARE ABOUT ONE MILLION CALIFORNIANS ARE STILL LACKING OVER* TO SAVE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER. EVEN. WITH THIS STATE'S ONGOING EFFORT AND CURRENT LAW ALREADY ALLOW THE WATER BOARD TO REQUIRE THE CONSOLIDATION. AND EXTENSION OF SERVICES TO WATER SYSTEM DATA GOOD GUY ARE STRUGGLING TO PROVIDE CLEAN DRINKING WATER. THIS BILL FOCUS UNDER RELEASED SMALL WATER SYSTEM THERE ARE OFTEN.

OMINOUS NOT JUST THE CITY OF FRESNO IT'S HUNDREDS OF COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT THE STATE ITS TOMBSTONE TERRITORY JUST OUTSIDE THE SANGER IT'S THE AREA OUTSIDE OF THE COMMUNITY SERVICE DISTRICT OF DEL HIGH. AND AGAIN THE CONTAMINANTS VARY BUT THE SITUATIONS DON'T AND THAT THERE ARE THEM THE. SOME OF THE MOST VULNERABLE CALIFORNIANS JUST WITH AND WITHIN A MILE SOMETIMES FIVE HUNDRED FEET SOMETIMES. TWENTY FEET OF A SERVICE LINES THAT PROVIDE SAFE AND AFFORDABLE DRINKING WATER AND THIS BILL SIMPLY IMPROVES UPON A A TOOL THAT THE STATE ALREADY HAS.

NOW ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL OF WOULD YOU COME FORWARD PLEASE TESTIMONY IS LIMITED TO TWO MINUTES. TWO WITNESSES EACH. GOOD AFTERNOON MEMBERS AND CAN UNITS ON BEHALF OF THE ASSOCIATION OF CALIFORNIA WATER AGENCIES WHEN I THINK THE AUTHOR AND HIS. STAFF HAVE BEEN VERY GENEROUS ONE WE WANT TO MAKE SURE THAT. IF LANGUAGE IS BEING DELETED FROM EXISTING LAW THAT ALLOWS WATER AGENCIES TO RECOVER COSTS. WE THINK THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD SHOULD BE STRONGER LANGUAGE REQUIRING THEM TO COVER THE COSTS OF CONSOLIDATIONS THAT'S REALLY ARE. OUR PRIMARY CONCERN. SO YOU ARE AT OPPOSE OR ARE WE ARE POSING AS AMENDED RIGHT NOW WE JUST WANT TO SEIZE STRONGER LANGUAGE. OKAY AROUND BECAUSE RICK. OKAY CAN THANK YOU VERY MUCH. SHORTNESS WITNESS TESTIMONY TO HIM. IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WANTS TO TEST BY AN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL PLEASE COME TO THE MICROPHONE. NO ONE OKAY I'VE QUESTIONS COMMENTS FROM THE DIET. MISTER BRO. THINKING I SHARE MR CHIU THANKS FOR BRINGING THIS. THIS BILL FORWARD. A. I'M ALL FOR CONSOLIDATION BUT I THINK FOR DIFFERENT REASONS. YOU KNOW IN MY I'VE TEN COMMUNITIES IN MY DISTRICT I THINK WE HAVE SIX WATER DISTRICTS. SIX BOARDS YOU KNOW ALL THAT. AND ESSENTIALLY THERE JUST MIDDLEMAN ABOUT DELIVERING A SERVICE FOR ASSUME THAT OR. ORANGE COUNTY WATER DISTRICT SOMETHIN. SO I'M ALL FOR CONSOLIDATION I THINK MY CONCERN IS. ONE OF MY DISTRICTS. IS SAN JUAN CAPISTRANO TO CITIES AND WE CAPS ON HAS OUR OWN WATER DISTRICT AND. IT'S IT'S GOT SOME AGING INFRASTRUCTURE AND. IT'S CONSIDER BY THE OTHER DISTRICT DOESN'T AS A BAD ASSET. LA WITH DEBT AND THINGS LIKE THAT AND BE A LOT COSTLY TO FOUND IMPROVE THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND GET UP TO. GET UP TO SPEED HOW WOULD YOU ADDRESS IF THERE WAS A CONSOLIDATION. AND IN ANOTHER AGENCY TOOK OVER THIS THIS BAD ASSET THAT HAS CONTAMINATED WATER AND MAYBE LEAKING PIPES AND THINGS WHAT WHAT HOW WOULD THE COST BE. BE DELIBERATED THROUGH THAT PROCESS. THAT WERE BROUGHT BACK TO COOK GOOD QUESTION BUT MY UNDERSTANDING. OF THE MOON I HOPE WE ALL OF IF I'M WRONG. THAT THE STATE TO ACTUALLY HOUSE OF FUNDING AVAILABLE. TO ADDRESS THIS ISSUE AND HOW I WANT TO GO BACK TO THIS BILL WAS FREELY FOCUS ON THOSE VERY VERY SMALL WATER DISTRICT. FIFTEEN OR CONNECTORS OR LAST OKAY YOU KNOW SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE SURE THAT. NOW TO BE ABLE TO. BECOME A PART OF THAT BIGGER WATER SYSTEM TO FOR TO ADDRESS THE TO THIS THE. WATER QUALITY. WELL THANKS FOR THAT CLARIFICATION OPPRESSION. ANYONE ELSE ON THE COMMITTEE WITH A QUESTION OR COMMENT LEARN ALUM. HUNCHED CLOSE. THERE WHEN YOU CHIU CLOSE VOTE THANK YOU ARGUE THAT RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR A BIBLE. I HAVE A QUESTION NO I'M SORRY BEFORE WE BEFORE WE JUST MOVE ON. BECAUSE ASSEMBLYMAN BRO AND I SHOULD YOU KNOW SHARE. THE SAME VIEWPOINT IS FOR IS BEING ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE THESE BUT THE QUESTION IS IS THERE ANY GUARANTEE THAT IT WON'T BE THE RATE PAYERS WHO HAVE TO ASSUME THE COST. IF THERE'S A GUARANTEED THAT. YOU DON'T THAT IT'S COMING FROM. GRANT FUNDS BOND FUNDS STATE WHEREVER IT'S COMING FROM. IT'S JUST IS THERE A GUARANTEE THAT IT'S NOT AND I AM FROM HARRY. I BELIEVE TO DAY I I'M SURE THERE IS A CURRENT THAT THE STATE REVOLVING FUND. AND IF BROWN'S A THE BOND OF PROCEEDS PROPOSITION ONE COULD ALSO A BLUE COVER SOME OF THE COST. AND I'M SURE THE PROPOSITION SIXTY A CURRENTLY ON THE BALLOT IT WILL IT COULD BE A ANOTHER POTENTIAL A FUNDING SOURCE. SO THERE OF SOME A REVOLVING FUND AVAILABLE TODAY. OKAY I'M WOULD THEIR REPRESENTATIVE FROM AQUA COME BACK UP HERE. JUSTIN. ALSO PROVIDER. RESPONSE TO THE. BOB I JUST LIKE TO POINT OUT AGAIN THIS IS FOR CONNECTIONS A FIFTEEN OR LESS. YEAH. SO FROM FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE CURRENT LAW DOES ALLOW A WATER SYSTEM TO. RECOVER COSTS THROUGH THE RATEPAYERS OF CHARGING. WITH THE RATEPAYERS THAT WERE SUBSUMED AND IN THIS NEW SYSTEM CHARGING THEM FOR THE COST OF CONSOLIDATION THIS BILL WOULD PROHIBIT THAT. AND SO WHAT WE WANT TO ENSURE IS THAT IF THE STATE WATER BOARD DOES INDEED HAVE FUNDING FOR THIS THAT THEY DO PAY FOR THAT. AND IT'S NOT THE WATER SYSTEM HAS TO JUST ABSORB IT SO. FOR US I DO UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE SOME FUN THERE SOME FUNDS AVAILABLE FOR THIS. THERE HAVE BEEN MANY CONSOLIDATIONS THERE HAVE BEEN MANDATED BY THE WATER BOARD I THINK BECAUSE FUNDING HAS BEEN DIFFICULT TO COME BY. SO. FOR US AT LEAST WE WANT SOME STRONG LANGUAGE IN THAT IT SAYS THE STATE WATER BOARD SHALL. COVER THE COSTS OF CONSOLIDATION. AND IS THERE ANY INTENTION ON YOUR PART MISTER CHIU TO ARAB LANGUAGE LIKE THAT OR PERHAPS AND GOOD TO BAYLISS IS AT THE STATE'S GOOD NOW. OF WOODEN NAM MANDATE THE CONSOLIDATION. WATER BOY Y. NOW MANDATED TO CONSOLIDATION ALASKA OR TO ADEQUATE FUNDING SOLD IT WOULD DO HOW BIRD. TAKE THAT APPROACH TO MAKE SURE THAT THE FUNDING TO STARE. BILL BEFORE THE WAR CAN MANDATE DOSA CONSOLIDATIONS SO IS YOUR YOUR PROTECTOR MY. THANK YOU. ALRIGHT I'M I I THINK. I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE THIS OUT. I THINK THAT AQUA HAS GOOD REASONS FOR ASKING FOR STRONGER LANGUAGE AND I WOULD SUGGEST YOU DO THAT. ARE AT THIS TIME AYE URGENT AYE VOTE SO WE CAN MOVE THE BILL FORWARD WHICH I THINK IS VERY IMPORTANT. YOU. OKAY THE BILL'S BEEN MOVED AND SECONDED SO WE WANT TO CALL THE ROLL. THIS IS ITEM SIX AB TWENTY FIVE OH ONE CHIU THE MOTION IS DO PASS AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. QUIRK I QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ AYE MELINDA'S AYE. ARAMBULA. BROKE. BROUGH AYE. BLOOM. HOLDEN. HOLDEN I. WHAT A TO CHEAT? WELL THAT'S WHAT SHE AYE. FIVE. ANSWERS TO CONGRATULATE YOU. I'M NEED. OUR ARMED. I'M NOT I'M GONNA GO PRESENTED ANOTHER COMMITTEE. I SINCE WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH FOR THIS IS PROBABLY GOOD TIME FOR ME TO GO. I SHALL RETURN TO CHAIRMAN WILL LAST HOPEFULLY BE DONE BY THE TIME WE GET BACK AND. AND WE LOSE. SOME FIVE THREE EIGHTHS. WELCOME TO THE COMMITTEE GUY HAD WHEN YOU'RE READY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MADAM CHAIR AND MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE TODAY I AM HERE TO PRESENT ASSEMBLY BILL TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT WHICH ALLOWS THE STATE WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD. TO DEVELOP FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES TO BETTER ASSIST LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WHEN DEVELOPING STORM WATER PERMITS. UNDER EXISTING FEDERAL LAW THE CLEAN WATER ACT REGULATES DISCHARGES OF POLLUTANTS INTO THE WATER OF THE UNITED STATES AND REGULATES QUALITY STANDARDS FOR SURFACE WATER WHILE TAKING FINANCIAL CAPABILITY INTO ACCOUNT. UNDER CALIFORNIA LAW THE PORTER COLOGNE. A WATER QUALITY ACT PROHIBITS THE DISCHARGE OF POLLUTANTS A TO SURFACE WATER UNLESS THE DISCHARGE OBTAINS A PERMIT FROM THE STATE WATER BOARD. I MISS FOR STORM WATER PERMITS ARE CRITICAL FOR PROTECTING PUBLIC HEALTH AND THE ENVIRONMENT BUT THEY CAN ALSO BE CHALLENGING AND COSTLY TO IMPLEMENT. ALTHOUGH CITIES AND COUNTIES ARE DEVELOPING THEIR STORMWATER POLLUTANT SCHEDULES MANY REMAIN IN NEED. OF GUIDANCE AND TECHNICAL EXPERTISE IN ORDER TO DEVELOP ADEQUATE CONSISTENT AND COST ARE INFORMED PERMITS. ACCORDING TO THE CALIFORNIA STATE AUDITOR MARCH FIRST TWENTY EIGHTEEN REPORT THEIR VARIOUS FINDINGS INDICATING THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD AND REGIONAL WHAT APPROACH BLACK. CONSISTENT INFORMATION ON COSTS THE LOCAL JURISDICTIONS INCUR IN COMPLYING WITH THE STORM WATER REQUIREMENTS THE AUDITOR ALSO FOUND THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS NOT ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED THE COST THAT LOCAL JURISDICTIONS WOULD INCUR IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH. REQUIREMENTS. AND THAT THE STATE WATER BOARD HAS NOT PROVIDED GUIDANCE TO LOCAL JURISDICTIONS ON HOW TO TRACK AND REPORT STORM WATER MANAGEMENT. EXPENDITURES MY BILL AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT ADDRESSES THESE ISSUES BY CALLING ON THE STATE WATER BOARD TO DEVELOP FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT GUIDELINES. THAT WILL PROVIDE GUIDANCE TO THE LA REGIONAL WATER BOARD WHEN HELPING LOCAL JURISDICTIONS DEVELOP STORMWATER PERMITS. THIS BILL IS A PILOT PROJECT TO ASSESS. IF A FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ANNOUNCES CAN BE EFFECTIVE. EFFECTIVELY USED TO HELP ADDITIONAL CALIFORNIA MUNICIPALITIES I WOULD LIKE TO THANK THE COMMITTEE POOR SUGGEST BUT SUGGESTED AMENDMENTS WHICH I ACCEPT. HERE TO TESTIFY IN SUPPORT I HAVE TWO WITNESSES. ERIC WOLFE ON BEHALF OF THE THANK YOU FOR VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS AND DIANA MY MOOD ALSO ON BEHALF OF THIS I GIVE ABOUT THE COUNCIL GOVERNMENT'S. THANK YOU VERY MUCH OF WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST OF BEGIN IRATE GO AHEAD. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER AND. HONORABLE COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M ERIC WHAT THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY COUNCIL OF GOVERNMENTS ARE REPRESENTING THIRTY CITIES IN OVER TWO MILLION RESIDENTS IN THE LA AREA. AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT IS INTENDED TO AFFORD FLEXIBILITY TO EXTEND THE TIMELINE FOR COMPLIANCE. WITH STORMWATER PERMITS BASED ON TO SEE A CITIES DEMONSTRATED FINANCIAL NEED SO THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ABOUT THAT'S WHAT I SEE IS ABOUT. MANY LA COUNTY CITIES FACE STORMWATER COMPLIANCE ESTIMATES EXCEED SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS. THESE HIGH COSTS ARE SPECIALLY CHALLENGING FOR THE DISADVANTAGED COMMITTEES WITHIN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY. THOSE COMMITTEES OUR ALREADY STRUGGLE TO PROVIDE BASIC MUNICIPAL SERVICES. AND CALIFORNIA CITIES IN SINGLE VALLEY CITIES ARE NOT ALONE IN FACING THESE EXTRAORDINARY COSTS. WELL THIS IS A PROBLEM THAT'S REPEATED ACROSS THE COUNTRY. AND IN RESPONSE TO THIS CHALLENGE THE EPA IN TWO THOUSAND FOURTEEN RELEASED. FINANCIAL CAPABILITY ASSESSMENT FRAMEWORK SO THE EPA HAS FCA GUIDELINES. IF IT IS A LITTLE BIT COMPLICATED BUT THEIR STAFF IS DESCRIBED IT AS PROVIDING REGULATORS WITH THE FLEXIBILITY TO CONSIDER. A MUNICIPAL PERMIT TEASE ABILITY TO PAY FOR AND DELIVER WATER SERVICES. IT CONSIDERS VARIOUS MEASURES SUCH AS HOUSE A HOUSEHOLDS ABILITY TO PAY FOR THE TOTALITY. OF WATER RELATED COSTS. AS WELL AS THE COMMUNITIES FINANCIAL ABILITY TO DELIVER SERVICES BASED ON SEVERAL FACTORS SUCH AS THEIR DEBT BURDEN THEIR DEMOGRAPHICS AND SOME OTHER CHARACTERISTICS. REGARDING THE HOUSEHOLD COSTS. NOW THE EPA RECOMMENDS CAPPING WATER RELATED EXPENSES THAT THE TOTAL WATER RELATED EXPENSES AT FOR A HALF PERCENT. OF MEDIAN HOUSEHOLD INCOME. AND THAT'S IMPORTANT BECAUSE IN TWO THOUSAND FIFTEEN THE US CONFERENCE OF MAYORS. CONDUCTED A STUDY AND FOUND THAT ALMOST HALF OF SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CITIES HAVE SOME RESIDENTS THAT ARE PAYING MORE. THAN THAT FOREIGN A HALF PERCENT MHI FOR THEIR WATER AND IN SOME CITIES IT WAS OVER TWENTY PERCENT OF RESIDENTS THAT PAY MORE THAN THAT SO. SO A FIFTY THEIR POPULATION. AND THIS IS JUST ONE REASON THAT HIGHLIGHTS THE NEED FOR AB TWENTY FIVE. THIRTY EIGHT. FOR THE STATE WATER BOARD TO ESTABLISH FCA GUIDELINES AND TO DEVELOP AN UNDERSTANDING OF THE COSTS A MUNICIPALITIES BOTH HOUSEHOLDS AND CITIES. FOR WATER RELATED COSTS. I WOULD LIKE TO SEE THE STATE BOARD AND THE LA REACH REPORTER PARTICULAR USE THOSE GUIDELINES IN THIS PILOT PROJECT. COUNCIL MEMBER MAHMOUD WILL FOLLOW WITH SOME ADDITIONAL AND THOUGHTS ABOUT IF CA AND HOW CAN HELP CITIES. BUT I SUBMIT THAT AB TWENTY FIVE THIRTY EIGHT OFFERS A COMMON SENSE APPROACH. TO THE HIGH ESTIMATED COST OF THE MESS FOR PERMIT COMPLIANCE. AND WILL BE PARTICULARLY HELPFUL TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WHO ARE ALREADY STRUGGLING. TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO THEIR. THANK YOU FOR YOUR TESTIMONY YOU ARE OVER YOUR TIME LIMIT BUT COUNSELING MAHMOUD WOULD YOU WANT TO AND JUMP IN THEIR GIVE YOUR TESTIMONY PLEASE I SURE WOULD THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THE OPPORTUNITY. TO PRESENT TESTIMONY I AM I AM I NOT ONLY REPRESENT MY CITY OF SOUTH PASADENA BUT I'M ALSO CHAIR OF THE WATER POLICY COMMITTEE AT THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY CALLED. THANK YOU ASSEMBLY MEMBER MURATSUCHI FOR INITIATING YOUR REQUEST TO THE STATE AUDITOR IT CONFIRMS WHAT WE HAVE BEEN SAYING AS CITIES FOR SEVERAL YEARS BAD IS THAT REGIONAL BOARDS ARE NOT CONSIDERING THE COST OF COMPLIANCE. AND BAT. THERE'S NO ESTABLISHED METRICS BY WHICH TO TRACK STORM WATER COST AND HOW CAN THE STATE RESPONSIBLY ADDRESS AND IMPOSE. STORM WATER QUALITY PERMITS WITHOUT KNOWING THE COST THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE BECAUSE STORM WATER IS AN ORPHAN UTILITY. USUALLY CITIES HAVE NO OTHER SOURCE OF FUNDS. TO ADDRESS THEIR STORM WATER COMPLIANCE PERMIT REQUIREMENTS OTHER BAND THEIR GENERAL FUNDS AND AS YOU HAVE PROBABLY HEARD FROM YOUR CONSTITUENTS CITIES THE GENERAL FUNDS ARE VERY MUCH UNDER STRESS STATEWIDE. BECAUSE OF THE CONTINUED AND INCREASING COSTS OF HAVING TO FUND PURRS I KNOW MY CITY WHICH DID NOT GO ABOVE THE STANDARD CLASSIC PURRS TO PERCENT FIFTY FIVE. ARM WE ARE LOOKING AT SEVERAL PROJECTED YEARS OF READING. AND WOOD THAT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO PURRS SO THIS IS SOMETHING THAT'S REALLY IMPORTANT. IT ISN'T IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE QUITE FRANKLY FOR THE STATE BOARDS IN THE REGIONAL BOARDS TO IMPOSE THESE COSTS WITHOUT KNOWING THE COST OF COMPLIANCE FEDERAL REGULATIONS REQUIRE THAT CITIES PROVIDE. COST OF COMPLIANCE INFORMATION BUT WITHOUT UNIFORM METRICS BY WHICH TO UNDERSTAND THE MEANING AND THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THOSE COSTS WHAT GOOD IS THE INFORMATION AND SO NOT SURPRISINGLY WITH AUDIT CONFIRMS IS AT THE REGIONAL BOARD IN THE STATE BOARD DOES NOT PAY ANY ATTENTION. TO THE INFORMATION THAT'S PROVIDED BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT CITIES REPORT THEIR COSTS SEPARATELY. SO WHAT THIS BILL DOES IS IT REQUIRES THE STATE BOARD TO RESTORE PUSH THOSE FINANCIAL REPORTING GUIDELINES AND THEN SECONDLY IT WOULD ESTABLISH A PILOT PROJECT BY WHICH THE REGIONAL BOARD. WOULD APPLY THOSE GUIDELINES IN THE SAN GABRIEL VALLEY THE ESTIMATED COST OF COMPLIANCE IS SIX BILLION DOLLARS WE NEED THE SPELL AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH COUNCILWOMAN WE APPRECIATE YOUR TESTIMONY IS THERE ANYONE ELSE WHO WISHES COME FOR AND SPEAK IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL. NOW OKAY IS THERE ANYONE MADAM CHAIR YES A BY MAY PAUL GIVES ALL OF US HERE REPRESENT THE CITY OF GLENDORA WE LIKE TO THINK THE AUTHOR FOR WHO LEADERSHIP. ON THIS ISSUE AND WE ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT. IS THERE ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL. NOW OPPOSITION TELLING OF THIS IS THE COMMITTEE TO BE IN TODAY THERE'S HARDLY ANY OPPOSITION. OKAY SINCE THERE'S NO OPPOSITION. USER ANY COMMENT MR MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU VERY MUCH MS RUBIO FOR BRINGING. THIS. A BILL FORWARD AND AND. TO ADDRESS THIS VERY COMPELLING ISSUE. COMMUNITIES THROUGHOUT. THE STATE ARE. SCREAMING FOR RELIEF. THE THE STORMWATER PERMIT. DEMANDS BEING PLACED UPON THEM WITHOUT ANY. REAL SOLUTION AS TO HOW TO PAY FOR IT AND SO. I I HAVE NOT HAD A STATE OPPORTUNITIES TO. TO A FULLY APPRECIATE YOUR YOUR BELL AND AND AND I WILL GIVE IT TO. CLOSER. REVIEW BUT. I WILL BE SUPPORTING A BILL. THANK YOU.

DELETE SECTION TWO ONE ZERO NINE NINE POINT FIVE FOUR FROM THE BILL. EXEMPT A HOUSING FROM THE PROOF PROVISIONS OF THE BILL. AND FURTHER CLARIFIED THE SCOPE OF PROJECTS TO BE COMPLETE CONSIDERED. MEMBERS AB TWO FOUR FOUR SEVEN WILL ENSURE THAT CRITICAL STEPS ARE TAKEN THROUGH THE SECRET PROCESS TO TRULY ENGAGE COMMUNITIES. WHICH CURRENTLY SHOULDER THE UNDUE BURDEN OF POLLUTION. THE CORE MESSAGE OF THIS BILL IS SIMPLE. CALIFORNIA SHOULD PRIORITIZE BRINGING THE MOST VULNERABLE GROUPS. IN THE STATE TO THE TABLE WHEN MAKING LOCAL LAND USE DECISIONS. CALABAR SCREEN CURRENTLY IN ITS THREE POINT OH VERSION IS A TOOL THAT ALLOWS US TO BETTER RECOGNIZE LINKAGES. BETWEEN ENVIRONMENTAL DEGRADATION AND POVERTY. IN ORDER TWO INFORMED DECISION MAKERS AND THE PUBLIC. IF WE KNOW THAT AREAS WITHIN THESE COMMUNITIES ARE NOT ONLY POLLUTED BUT ALSO ME STRUGGLING TO BE ENGAGED IN THE TRADITIONAL SUPER PROCESS. GIVEN BARRIERS IN PLACE FOR THE PEOPLE AND LOW INCOME. COMMUNITIES. PUBLIC POLICY MAKERS SHOULD DO EVERYTHING THEY CAN TO ENGAGE THE COMMUNITY IN THE PLANNING PROCESS. THIS BILL REPRESENTS A STEP TO ENSURE THAT IN. TO ENSURE THAT IN WHAT. TO ENSURE JUST THAT IN THIS CONFUSING PROCESS. WE NEED THE VOICES OF ALL THE COMMUNITIES TO BE HEARD. I HAVE WORKED WITH STAKEHOLDER GROUPS AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO IN ORDER TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR MOST VULNERABLE. DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE BROUGHT TO THE TABLE FOR LAND USE DECISIONS. WITHOUT A HERE TO TO TO SPEAK ON BEHALF OF THIS BILL ARE DION OF OSCARS WITH THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE. AND ASHLEY WARNER SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY. THANK YOUR SOMEONE AND REYES. YOU HAVE TWO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH WHO WOULD LIKE TO GO FIRST. SANTIAGO PERSONAL GAIN RIGHT THERE FOR MY TIME WITH MY NEXT BOB COLLEAGUE SO MY NAME IS AND FACE AND I'M HERE BE HAVE A CALIFORNIA MUM'S JUST ALLIANCE. AND WE SUPPORT THIS BILL FOR THE REASONS THAT. THAT WILL BE INDICATED BY MY COLLEAGUE ACTUALLY AND GIVEN THAT COMMUNITIES THAT SHE WORKS AND IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY SPECIFIC IN THE CITY OF FRESNO BUT WE FEEL AS IT ASSOCIATION THIS IS A BILL THAT'S GOING TO ACTUALLY AFFECT ALL CALIFORNIA'S THROUGHOUT THE STATE. AND SPECIFICALLY THE COMMUNITIES THAT ARE MOST IMPACTED BY SPECIFICALLY FACILITIES ARE GONNA BE EITHER BEING CITED IN SPECIFIC AREAS SELF WITHOUT A MINUTE TO FOR THE REST OF MY TIME WITH ACTUALLY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH AT GOOD AFTERNOON COMMITTEE MEMBERS THANK YOU FOR ALLOWING ME TO SPEAK TODAY ABOUT WHY MY ORGANIZATION AND ORGANIZATIONS AROUND THE STATE STRONGLY SUPPORTED AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN. ANSWERS WAS MENTIONED MY NAME IS ASHLEY WARNER I'M A SENIOR ATTORNEY WITH LEADERSHIP COUNCIL FOR JUSTICE AND ACCOUNTABILITY WHICH IS THIS BILL SPONSOR. LEADERSHIP COUNCIL WORKS ALONGSIDE HUNDREDS OF RESIDENTS OF DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ACROSS THE SAN JOAQUIN VALLEY AND HE'S COACHELLA VALLEY. ADVOCATE FOR SOUND POLICY AND ERADICATE INJUSTICE TO SECURE EQUAL ACCESS TO OPPORTUNITY REGARDLESS OF WEALTH RACE INCOME OR PLACE. LEADERSHIP COUNCIL IS ALSO A MEMBER OF THE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE ALLIANCE ALONG WITH THE CENTER ON RACE POVERTY IN THE ENVIRONMENT WHO ARE ALSO HERE TODAY AND WILL SPEAK TO THE NEED FOR A MERIT OF THIS BILL AS WELL AND. ALONG WITH A NUMBER OF RESIDENTS FROM KERN COUNTY WHO HAVE COME UP SPECIFICALLY TO SPEAK ON THIS BILL. AND THROUGHOUT THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES VERY DISPROPORTIONATE BURDEN OF HAZARDOUS INCLUDING LAND USES NEXT DOOR TO THEIR HOMES THEIR SCHOOLS THEIR PARKS IN THEIR PLACES OF WORSHIP. THESE FACILITIES OFTEN CONTRIBUTE TEMPERAMENTAL DEGRADATION THROUGH THE RELEASE OF CRITERIA AIR POLLUTANTS AND TOXIC AIR CONTAMINANTS FOUL ODORS WATER CONTAMINATION AND OTHER IMPACTS WHICH IN TURN. UNDERMINE RESIDENTS NEIGHBORHOOD QUALITY AND ALSO CONTRIBUTED DISPROPORTIONATELY POOR PUBLIC HOUSE HEALTH OUTCOMES IN IMPACTED LOWER INCOME COMMUNITIES AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR. RESIDENTS OFTEN HAVE LITTLE OR NO MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE PUBLIC INPUT ON THESE FACILITIES BEFORE THEY ARE APPROVED ARE CONSTRUCTED. IN MANY CASES IT RESIDENTS ONLY FIND OUT ABOUT THEM WHEN CONSTRUCTION BEGINS IN FRONT OF THEIR HOUSE. OIL WELLS IN KERN COUNTY IN LOS ANGELES MASSIVE WAREHOUSES AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS IN THE INLAND EMPIRE IN FRESNO CREMATORIUMS IN RICHLAND RICHMOND ARE ONLY A FEW EXAMPLES. AS A RESULT OF THE LACK OF NOTICE AND MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO PROVIDE INPUT AT THE PERSPECTIVE OF RESIDENTS FROM THE POLLUTION THE MOST POLLUTION BRING COMMUNITIES ARE NOT HEARD. AND POTENTIAL PROJECT IMPACTS AND DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED OR ADDRESSED. THAT'S DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE BENEFITS OF SEEK WAS INTENDED PURPOSE WITCHES OF I QUOTE. TO ENSURE THE LONG TERM PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE PROVISION OF A DECENT HOME AND SUITABLE LIVING ENVIRONMENT FOR EVERY CALIFORNIAN. CALIFORNIA HAS TAKEN GREAT STRIDES BECOME A LEADER NATIONWIDE IN THE MOVEMENT FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. AB TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN PROVIDES THE NEXT STEP FORWARD BY ENSURING THAT CALIFORNIA'S MOST VULNERABLE COMMUNITIES HAVE MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES TO LEARN ABOUT AND PROVIDE INPUT SOME PROJECTS THAT MAY IMPACT THEIR HEALTH HOMES AND NEIGHBORHOODS. THIS IS SOMETHING THAT ALL CALIFORNIANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO SUPPORT AND WE THINK THE AUTHOR FOR. MOVING THIS BILL FORWARD.

AND WE SEE IT IN PRINT IT WILL REMOVE THIS BILL OFF THE CHAMBERS JOB TO OUR LIST. HOWEVER. AT WE DON'T OPPOSE THE INTENT OF THIS BILL BUT THERE ARE SOME SPECIFIC. ISSUES THAT WE TAKE WITH SOME OF THE MORE SPECIFIC SEEK WERE. CHANGES REGARDING HOW THEY DEFINE. OR EXPAND THE DEFINITION OF PROJECT UNDER SEEK WELL WE STILL HAVE ISSUE WITH. A.

CASSIE GILSON ON BEHALF OF THE CALIFORNIA BUILDING INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION AND I TOO WANT TO THANK THE AUTHOR AND HER STAFF FOR THEIR EARLY OUTREACH AND. I AM VERY THOROUGH ENGAGEMENT I'M WE'RE WORKING WITH THEM ON AMENDMENTS CLEARLY HOUSING IS NOT THE FOCUS OF THIS BILL ADAM AND I WERE JUST FINE TUNING THOSE NOW AND LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH HER GOING FORWARD TO GET THOSE. A PERFECTED. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANYONE ELSE IN OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD. YET THREE MINUTES LEFT BECAUSE THEY DIDN'T USE OVER TIME THIS WILL BE EVEN QUICKER THAN THAT. I'M REALLY COVERAGE WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF REALTORS AND I WANTED TO THINK ASSEMBLYMEMBER REYES FOR TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION OUR CONCERNS. ANDREMOVING THE PROVISIONS THAT WOULD HAVE CREATED HOUSING IS PERHAPS A SUBJECT LAND USE AND SO WITH THE AMENDMENTS WE WILL BE REMOVING OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THINK YOU. MARIAN WARMER DOWN THE ROAD COUNTIES REPRESENT AS A CALIFORNIA WE REALLY APPRECIATE THE AMENDMENTS THE STAFF HAS BEEN GREAT TO WORK WITH. AND WE'RE VERY CLOSE TO REMOVING OUR OPPOSITION THANK YOU. THANK YOU. REX ON MY BEHALF CALIFORNIA MS PROPERTIES ASSOCIATION SHOWING THE SAME SENTIMENTS BUT STILL RISE RIGHT NOW OPPOSE. OKAY. THANK YOU VERY MUCH. WITH THAT IS THERE ANY DISCUSSION MISTER MURATSUCHI. THANK YOU. IS RUBIO FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND. FIGHTING FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. IT'S A. I'M SORRY WHAT I SAY. ROUGHLY HOME. JUSTICE HERE YEAH. IT'S BEEN A LONG DAY. I APOLOGIZE FOR NOT. I DO LOOK LIKE A JONES FOR THE SENATE SEAT MISTER HOLDEN. THANK YOU MS WRAITHS FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP ON THE ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE. YEAH I. COMPLETELY AGREE WITH THAT YEAH YOU'RE. YOUR FOCUS ON PROVIDING GREATER NOTICE. TO DISADVANTAGED COMMUNITIES WE HAD A FULL DISCUSSION ON YOUR BILL AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEE WHERE WE ADDRESS TO. THAT THE SEQUEL ISSUES. ARE WE RAISED THE CONCERNS ABOUT THE. DISCRIMINATION LANGUAGE. AND WHILE WE ARE FULLY APPRECIATE THEY AND THEY INTEND TO YOU KNOW THERE WERE SOME ISSUES THAT DATA. DATA WE WERE CONCERNED AND SO ON NINE. GLAD TO SEE THAT YOU ARE A WOMAN OF YOUR WORD IN THAT YOU HAD TO TAKE OUT THAT. THAT LANGUAGE BUT IN OVERALL LOOK FOR TO. WHERE WE KNOW THAT THE AND THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER WITH YOUR BILL? BUT YOUR IMPORT YOUR BILL IS A VERY IMPORTANT STEP IN IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION AND SO ON A THANK YOU VERY MUCH AND INDICATE MY SUPPORT FOR A BILL. THANK YOU. THANK YOU ANYONE ELSE WITH ANY COMMENTS OR QUESTIONS. MR BREAUX. THANK YOU MADAM I SHARE. MY ONLY CONCERN WITH THIS IS. TAKEN THE LOCAL CONTROL AND. I SAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL AND. YOU KNOW. AS A AS A PERSON WHO SAT IN THE COASTAL ZONE. WELL AWARE OF. THE PROCESS AND THE TIME TO NOTIFY PEOPLE OF A CERTAIN PROJECT. SO SO THAT'S WHY COME DOWN I THINK. NO IF IF A PROJECT GETS APPROVED IN A GOES UP THINK THE LOCALS HAVE. YOU KNOW YOU HAVE A RECOURSE VOTE THE LOCALS OUT IF YOU DON'T LIKE PROJECT IT WENT UP AND YOU CAN GET NOTICE. SO I JUST MY ISSUE IS NO ELECTED OFFICIALS AT THE LOCAL LEVEL WHO PROBABLY KNOWS BETTER THAN WE DO IN SACRAMENTO. ON WHAT'S BEST FOR THEIR COMPUTER COMMUNITY WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS THEY WHAT WHAT TYPE OF PROJECTS THEY DON'T WANT. AND SO I AS SOMEONE WHO SAT ON THE CITY COUNCIL ON JUST GONNA. I BELIEVE THAT UP TO LOCAL SUICIDE PROJECTS THAT ARE GOOD AND BAD FOR THEIR COMMUNITY SO I'M I'M NOT GONNA BE ABLE TO SUPPORT IT. THANK YOU SO MEMBER ANYONE ELSE. QUIET ON THAT SIDE OF THE HOUSE OKAY. OKAY. SO. DO WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. OKAY WE HAVE A MOTION AND A SECOND. I HAVE SOME COMMENTS AND THEN MISTER CHAIRMAN DO YOU WANT TO CLOSE IT UP. SO. I THINK OF. WELL I MEAN YOU WITH YOUR. CLOSING IT APPEAR. I WANT TO COMMEND YOU ON AND TAKING THE STEPS NECESSARY TO REMOVE SOME OF THE OPPOSITION I THINK. THAT IS A TESTAMENT TO YOUR STICKING TO YOUR WORD. IT APPEARS THAT THE HOUSING SIDE IS HAPPY THAT THEY'RE NO LONGER IN THE CROSS HAIRS BUT THE COMMERCIAL SIDE STILL NOT SO HAPPY BECAUSE THEY'RE STILL IN THE CROSS HAIRS AND I THINK I. AGREE WITH MY COLLEAGUE FROM ORANGE COUNTY THAT WE DON'T WANT TO USURP LOCAL AUTHORITY. RIGHT NO MATTER HOW MUCH WE BELIEVE IN THE CAUSE I THINK THERE'S A REASON WHY WE HAVE LOCAL ELECTED OFFICIALS IN PLACE WHERE THEY HAVE THE AUTHORITY THEY DO. SAID THEY CAN DO THEIR JOB AND WHEN THEY DON'T THEN THE WILL OF THE PEOPLE. TAKES OVER IN EITHER VOTES HIM OUT OF OFFICE OR LISA MEN THERE BECAUSE THEY'RE DOING A WONDERFUL JOB THAT'S. YOU NO MIKE IN TERMS TO AND I'M SURE YOU PROBABLY FEEL THE SAME GIVEN THAT YOU KNOW YOU HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN HERE IN THE STATE ASSEMBLY. THEM SO FOR THOSE REASONS. I'M NOT ABLE TO SUPPORT BILL TABOR I DO APPRECIATE THE STEPS YOU'VE TAKEN AND TO IMPROVE THE BILL AND THEN I THINK. I'M IF YOU'D LIKE TO CLOSE AND I BELIEVE THE CHAIRMAN WILL HAVE SOME FINAL COMMENTS AND THEN WILL TAKE ABOUT. WHY SURE APPRECIATE THAT THE THE OPPORTUNITY AND? I DID SAY WE WOULD TAKE OUT THE DISCRIMINATION. AND I WE TOOK CARE OF THAT AND IT'S NO LONGER ON THE JOB KILLER LIST AS A RESULT OF THAT. I TOLD YOU HOUSING WAS NOT INCLUDED WE TOOK THAT OUT NOR NO LONGER ON THE HOUSING KILLER LIST. MMHM. THIS IS A REALLY IMPORTANT BILL FOR COMMUNITIES THAT SUFFER THE MOST BECAUSE. THEY SUFFER DISPROPORTIONATELY. BECAUSE OF WHERE THEY ARE BECAUSE OF THEIR PLACER ZIP CODE BECAUSE OF THE INCOME LEVEL. AND IT'S THOSE COMMUNITIES THAT SHOULD HAVE NOTICE THEY SHOULD HAVE THAT OPPORTUNITY IT SHOULDN'T BE THAT THEY OPT IN AND THEY SAY PLEASE SEND US NOTICE THEN THEY WILL. BE GIVEN FURTHER NOTICE. THEY SHOULD RECEIVE THE LETTER SAYING WE WANT YOUR INPUT. ADD TO THIS IS WHAT THE BILL DOES IT PROVIDES THAT OPPORTUNITY SO IT'S MORE PROACTIVE APPROACH. A SEQUEL TO MAKE SURE THAT THOSE COMMUNITIES TO GET TO GIVE INPUT. BECAUSE WE ALREADY KNOW THAN THEY'VE ALREADY BEEN IDENTIFIED BY KILLING VIRAL BY KILL VIRAL SCREEN. AS THE MOST DISADVANTAGED SO WITHOUT I THANK ALL OF YOU FOR YOUR COMMENTS HERE AND THE NATURAL RESOURCES. AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR IPHONE. ALRIGHT AYE MADAM SECRETARY WOULD YOU PLEASE TAKE THE ROLE OR A MISTER QUIRK. YOU'RE SO QUIET OVER THERE IT YEAH. I HAVE TO BE. SAY THE ONLY THING THIS BILL DOES IS REQUIRED NOTICE. AND SO. BEAR WITH ME. IT IS. THE MUSIC PLAYING IN BETWEEN I KNOW HOW. UP IT ONLY REQUIRES NOTICE. PERIOD IT TAKES NO DISCRETION AWAY FROM THE LOCALS. ARM FRANKLY IN HAYWARD WE ALWAYS GAVE NOTICE TO PEOPLE WHO WERE NEARBY PERIOD A LOT COMMUNITIES DO THIS BUT SOME DON'T. I WILL ALSO SAY THAT COMMUNITIES OF. THAT ARE WELL ESTABLISHED. ARM ART IN POVERTY TEND TO HAVE NEIGHBORHOOD ASSOCIATIONS HAVE ASKED OFTEN. WE'RE TALKING ABOUT POOR COMMUNITIES. THAT MAY NOT HAVE SOMEONE IN THAT COMMUNITY WHO HAS OPTED IN TO GET THESE NOTICES. AND THAT IS ALL THIS DOES AND. AND THE OPPOSITION HER CAR CORRECT ME BUT I BELIEVE THE ONLY THING THEY'RE CONCERNED ABOUT. IS A BETTER DEFINITION. OF. WHAT SORT OF FIRM? PROJECTS WOULD REQUIRE THE NOTICE IS THAT CORRECT. WELL. WHO DETERMINES WHAT A SUBJECT LAND USE IS IS TO A STATE AGENCY WE ARE AND THERE'S SOME AMBIGUITY AS TO THE DIRECTION THIS BILL PROVIDES TO A STATE AGENCY SO? AS TO WHO GETS THE NOTICES THERE'D WHAT IS ENCOMPASSED UNDER SUBJECT LAND USE. THAT IS ALLOCATED NOW TO STATE AGENCIES AS OPPOSED TO A LOCAL JURISDICTIONS GOT AND MAYBE THAT THAT THAT THE DIFFICULTY WE HAVE. IS NOT EVERYONE DEFINES INDUSTRIAL USES THE SAME WAY. ARM A WAREHOUSE THAT HAS A LOT OF TRUCKS COMING IN AND OUT. ME NOT BE DEFINED AS INDUSTRIAL. ARM. CERTAINLY IF THE AUTHOR IS ABLE. COME UP WITH A LIST OF USES OUR THAT WOULD BE BEST. ARM IF YOU CAN SUGGEST. A DIFFERENT WAY OF OF. DEFINING KNEES WE WOULD CERTAINLY APPRECIATE IT. ARM AND THAT IT WOULD BE. BEST IF WE DIDN'T HAVE TO GO TO A STATE AGENCY TO FIND. ARM AND THAT IS SOMETHING THE AUTHOR I KNOW WANTS TO WORK ON. STARTING YOUR HEAD YES. SO I THINK WE WILL BE ABLE. TO COME UP WITH A. SATISFACTORY DEFINITION I HOPE WE DON'T HAVE TO GO TO A STATE AGENCY BUT IF WE DO WILL MAKE SURE THAT WE HAVE GOOD LANGUAGE AND WILL BE WORKING WITH THE AUTHOR ON THAT. AND. AGAIN IF YOU SUGGEST A DIFFERENT AGENCY THAT'S SOMETHING WE CAN CERTAINLY LOOK AT. BUT WE DON'T WANT SOMEBODY TO AVOID. THE NOTICE REQUIREMENT BY SAYING รณ THIS IS AN INDUSTRIAL WITH SOMETHING ELSE AND THAT'S. THAT'S THE ONLY REASON WE JUST DIDN'T SAY INDUSTRIAL IN S. SO IT'S A REAL PROBLEM AND IT'S SOMETHING THAT WE HAVE TIME TO WORK ON AND IF. IF YOU'RE WILLING TO WORK WITH US TO WORK WITH THE AUTHOR I HOPE WE CAN COME UP WITH A SATISFACTORY SOLUTION. SO. I'M VERY MUCH IN FAVOR OF THIS AS I SAID SOME COMMUNITIES DO THIS SOME DON'T. I THINK IT IS VERY IMPORTANT IN AGAIN ALL WE'RE TALKING THAT AS NOTICE IF NO ONE WAS WORRIED ABOUT IT. THERE WON'T EVEN BE AN IMPACT AND IF PEOPLE ARE. THEN AS SOMEONE SAID HERE THEY BETTER LISTEN TO THEIR CONSTITUENTS. ALRIGHT. WITH THAT. I ASK FOR AN AYE VOTE. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER FOUR EIGHT BE TWENTY FOUR FORTY SEVEN ANDREAS THE MOTION IS TO PASS AS AMENDED AND RE REFER TO THE COMMITTEE ON APPROPRIATIONS. QUIRK. I QUIRK AYE MELENDEZ. MELENDEZ NO ARAMBULA. PRO. BRUNO. BLUE. BLOOM BY. HOLDEN. WHAT AT SOCHI? MATTEUCCI I. THE VOTE STANDS NOW AT THREE TO TWO. THANK YOU. THAT BILL IS ON CALL FOR NOW IN THE LAST BILL WE HAVE. IS MISTER BLOOM. VIOLATED NUMBER TWO AB TWO THREE SEVEN NINE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND MEMBERS. I ACCEPT. ALL LOOK THE COMMITTEES RECOMMENDED AMENDMENTS. THANK CA YOUR STAFF FOR. SOME VERY TEDIOUS AND HARD WORK ON THIS BILL. CLOTHING MADE FROM SYNTHETIC FABRICS DOMINATES THE CLOTHING INDUSTRY AND AS A RESULT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE REGULARLY WASH CLOTHES THAT ARE MADE OF SYNTHETIC MATERIAL THE CLOTHING I'M WEARING IS NO DIFFERENT IN FACT. ABOUT SIXTY PERCENT OF FABRIC PRODUCED IN THE TEXTILE INDUSTRY IN TWENTY FOURTEEN CONTAIN POLYESTER. AND WASHING CLOTHING MADE FROM THESE SYNTHETIC FABRICS. WE NOW KNOW RELEASES PLASTIC MICROFIBER IS THAT MAKE THEIR WAY INTO OUR WATER AND THEREIN LIES THE PROBLEM. IN TWENTY FIFTEEN THE REGIONAL MONITORING PROGRAM FOR WATER QUALITY IN SAN FRANCISCO BAY. TESTED THE EFFLUENT OF EIGHT WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS AND FOUND THAT EIGHTY PERCENT. OF THE MICRO PLASTICS THAT THEY FOUND ANOTHER MICROSCOPIC PARTICLES WERE IN FACT SMALL FIBERS FROM CLOTHING. EVERY TIME A FLEECE JACKET IS WASHED IT RELEASES HUNDREDS IF NOT THOUSANDS OF FIBERS AND TO GET AN IDEA OF THE SCALE OF THIS PROBLEM. THE AMOUNT OF PLASTIC RELEASED BY THE LAUNDERING OF ONE HUNDRED THOUSAND FLEECE JACKETS. IS EQUIVALENT TO UP TO NEARLY TWELVE HUNDRED PLASTIC GROCERY BAGS AND THIS IS ACCORDING TO A STUDY FROM UC SANTA BARBARA. BRAND SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL SCIENCE AND MANAGEMENT THAT WAS COMMISSIONED BY THE PATAGONIA COMPANY IN TWENTY SIXTEEN. STANDARD WASHING MACHINES DO NOT HAVE FILTERS TO CATCH THESE FIBERS AND ONCE THEY ESCAPE FROM OUR LAUNDRY THE TINY MOBILE THREATS WORKED OUR WAY TO OUR WASTE WATER TREATMENT PLANTS. THEIR FILTERS DON'T CATCH THE FIBERS EITHER AND AS A RESULT IT IS ESTIMATED THAT SYNTHETIC FIBERS ARE BY COUNT. NOW THE SINGLE LARGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO WATERSHED PLASTIC POLLUTION IN DEVELOPED COUNTRIES AND ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION. PLASTIC WASTE ENTERING THE OCEAN. WE DON'T KNOW YET THE EXTENT TO WHICH MICHAEL PLASTIC POLLUTION MIGHT AFFECT HUMANS. WE DO KNOW THAT MANY ANIMALS WITHIN THE AQUATIC FOOD CHAIN INGEST THESE PLASTICS. THIS CAN TRANSFER TO THEIR TISSUE AND BECAUSE GOD IMPACTION HORMONE DISRUPTION AND LIVER DAMAGE. MEANING WE ARE ALSO INGESTING PLASTIC MICROFIBER IS IF WE EAT. THOSE OF FISH AS FOOD. THIS RAISES AN IMPORTANT QUESTION ABOUT THE HUMAN HEALTH CONSEQUENCES OF UNINTENDED. CONSUMPTION OF PLASTIC MICROFIBER STE. YOU SEE DAVIS SAMPLED FISH AND SHELLFISH SOLD LOCAL. CALIFORNIA AT A LOCAL CALIFORNIA FISH MARKET AND FOUND ONE QUARTER OF THE FISSION ONE THIRD OF THE SHELLFISH. UNTAMED PLASTIC DEBRIS MOST OF THAT MICRO FIBERS. SIMILARLY A SURVEY COMPARED ONE HUNDRED AND FIFTY TAP WATER SAMPLES FROM LOCATIONS IN FIVE CONTINENTS. AND MICHAEL PLASTIC FIBERS WERE FOUND IN EVERY NEARLY EVERY SAMPLE. NINETY FOUR PERCENT OF THE UNITED STATES WATER SAMPLES CONTAINED PLASTIC MICROFIBER SITS. SCIENTISTS ARE FINDING THAT EVEN BOTTLED WATER IS CONTAMINATED WITH MICHAEL FIBERS. NOW IF YOU THINK ABOUT BOTTLED WATER THIS IS WATER THAT GOES THROUGH A VERY EXTENSIVE FILTRATION PROCESS. RESEARCHERS RECENTLY EXAMINED TWO HUNDRED AND FIFTY BOTTLES OF WATER SOLD BY MAJOR BRANDS. AND BOUGHT IN AND AND AND BOUGHT IN NINE DIFFERENT COUNTRIES. THE RESULTS NINETY THREE PERCENT OF THE TESTED WATERS SHOWED SIGNS OF MICHAEL PLASTIC CONTAMINATION. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE REQUIRES THAT NEW CLOTHING MADE PRIMARILY OF PLASTIC BE LABELED TO INDICATE THAT. THE IF THE LABEL TO END THE INDICATE THAT THE GARMENT SHEDS PLASTIC MICROFIBER IS WHEN WASHED. AND THAT THAT CONTRIBUTES TO MARINE PLASTIC POLLUTION AND THAT LANGUAGE WHILE NOT EXACT THAT IS PART OF THE MOST RECENT AMENDMENT TO THIS BILL SO THE LANGUAGE SIMPLY. INFORMS PEOPLE ABOUT THE. A MICROFIBER PROBLEM AND THAT MICROFIBER IS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO MARINE POLLUTION. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE I SHOULD POINT OUT IS NOT A BAND BUT IT IS AN IMPORTANT FIRST STEP THAT EDUCATES THE PUBLIC AND WILL HELP MOVE MANUFACTURERS. TOWARDS FINDING A LASTING SOLUTION WHICH IS WHAT WE REALLY SHOULD BE LOOKING FOR. I HAVE THREE WITNESSES WITH ME HERE TODAY JENNIFER WILLIAMS WITH THESE BAY MUD. ON. NOT TERRORISM FROM STOP WASTE AND MELISSA ROMERO WITH CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE THANK YOU THANK YOU MISTER BLOOM ON THAT THE. COMMITTEE POLICIES TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES EACH SO DO YOU WANT TO DIVIDE UP YOUR FOUR MINUTES AMONG THE THREE YEARS ARE ONLY TWO THAT WOULD LIKE TO TESTIFY. YOU DIVIDE UP THE TIME OKAY OFF YOU GO WHO WANTS TO GO FIRST. AND COME UP. MISTER CHAIR MADAM VICE CHAIRMAN IN JENNIFER WILLIAMSON WITH THE EAST BAY MUNICIPAL UTILITY DISTRICT. IN THE MIND OF THE WATER AND WASTEWATER TREATMENT PROVIDER. IN EAST BAY WE PROVIDE WASTEWATER TREATMENT SERVICES TO ABOUT SIX HUNDRED AND EIGHTY THOUSAND CUSTOMERS IN OUR SERVICE AREA. AND I'M HERE NAY TODAY TO TO SO TO SUPPORT AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE. SOME WE APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR'S WORK ON THE ISSUE OF PREVENTING PLASTIC PARA POLLUTION AND HAVE SUPPORTED PRIOR BELT FROM ON THE PLASTIC MICROBEADS ISSUES. TODAY WITH AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE IT'S BEEN MENTIONED THAT THE PLASTIC MICROFIBER IS OUR SMALL PLASTIC FIBERS FOUND IN SYNTHETIC FABRIC INCLUDING CLOTHING. THESE MICRO FIBERS ARE EXTREMELY SMALL AND ONCE WASHED DOWN THE DRAIN MAKE THEIR WAY TO WASTE WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS WHICH ARE NOT DESIGNED TO TREAT AT THESE PLASTIC MICRO FIBERS. SO THE MICRO FIBERS MAY ULTIMATELY REACH WATERWAYS AND THE OCEAN CONTRIBUTE CONTRIBUTING TO THE ACCUMULATION OF PLASTIC AT MARINE DEBRIS. AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE. LABELING REQUIREMENTS WOULD HELP CONSUMERS MAKE INFORMED DECISIONS ABOUT THE PURCHASE AS WELL AS THE CLEANING AND CARE OF THE CLOTHING MADE FROM SYNTHETIC MATERIAL. AND HELP PREVENT POLLUTION OF WATER BODIES THAT RECEIVE WASTEWATER DISCHARGE SO FOR THESE REASONS I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR AYE VOTE. THANK YOU VERY MUCH NEXT WITNESS PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS I'M UNDER NITROGEN AND I'M HERE TODAY ON BEHALF OF STOP WASTE. I'VE BEEN WORKING WITH A MEMBER AGENCIES WHICH INCLUDES FORKING CITIES THREE SANITARY DISTRICT IN THE COUNTY ITSELF. WE HAVE CONTINUED TO PLACE EMPHASIS ON WASTE PREVENTION OVER MANAGEMENT OF THE SCARVES AND WORKING ON UPSTREAM SOLUTIONS. WITH A FOCUS ON CREATING AWARENESS THROUGH EDUCATION AND PUBLIC COMMUNICATION. TO PROVIDE THE INFORMATION TO I RESIDENTS TO HELP THEM MAKE CONSCIOUS PURCHASING CHOICES. THIS BILL DOES JUST THAT IT PROVIDES. MEMBERS COMMUNITY MEMBERS THE ABILITY TO MAKE CHOICES. WITH THE UNDERSTANDING OF WHAT THE GETTING INTO. THIS IS CERTAINLY A FIRST STEP A AND LEAVING WILL RAISE THE AWARENESS TO MITIGATE THE ISSUE. WE REALIZE THAT EMERGING TECHNOLOGY CAN HELP MITIGATE THIS FURTHER. OF BUT AGAIN AS WE SAID GIVING PEOPLE THE CHOICE IS OUR FIRST STEP A TACKLE THIS CHALLENGE. UP CONSUMPTION BEHAVIOR NEEDS TO CHANGE NEW MATERIALS THAT DON'T SHED NEED TO BE DEVELOPED WASHING MACHINES NEED TO INCLUDE PHOTOS TO CAPTURE FIGHTERS. AND WHICH TREATMENT PLANS NEED TO BE UPDATED AND ALL THAT THIS CAN CONTINUE TO BE DONE AND THIS BILL DOES NOT PRECLUDE ANY OF THOSE FROM MOVING FORWARD. SO FOR THOSE REASONS AND FOR THE REASONS THAT WE AT STOP WASTE BELIEVE A AND IN PUBLIC OF. EDUCATION AND COMMUNICATION WE STRONGLY SUPPORT THIS BILL AND. URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF IT AS WELL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH GO AHEAD. THANK YOU MISTER CHAIR AND COMMITTEE MEMBERS MELISSA ROMERO WITH THE ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP CALIFORNIANS AGAINST WASTE PROUD CO SPONSOR OF THE BILL. AS THE ANNOUNCES POINTED OUT THERE IS NO DEBATE OVER WHETHER MICROFIBER POLLUTION IS A PROBLEM OR WHETHER WASHING CLOTHING MADE FROM SYNTHETIC TEXTILES CONTRIBUTES TO THAT PROBLEM. THE SCIENTIFIC PROOF IS UNDENIABLE THE SCIENCE SHOWS US THAT OUR SEAFOOD TAP WATER AND BOTTLED WATER CONTAINS MICRO FIBERS AND PEOPLE DESERVE TO KNOW THAT THEIR CLOTHING IS MADE FROM PLASTIC. AND THAT THEIR PURCHASING IN LAUNDRY HABITS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE MOST PERVASIVE TYPE. PLASTIC POLLUTION MICROFIBER POLLUTION. RECENT HISTORY SHOWN US THAT CALIFORNIANS OF ALL SOCIOECONOMIC STATUSES CULTURES AND AGES CARE ABOUT REDUCING MICRO ARE SORRY PLASTIC POLLUTION. IT'S TIME FOR CALIFORNIA TO ADDRESSED MICROFIBER POLLUTION WHICH DWARFS ALL OTHER CATEGORIES OF PLASTIC POLLUTION IN THE ENVIRONMENT AND ULTIMATELY IN OUR FOOD AND DRINKING WATER. AND WE URGE YOUR SUPPORT OF THE BILL THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH A WHO ELSE WOULD LIKE TO COME FORWARD AND TESTIFY IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL NAME AND ORGANIZATIONALLY PLEASE. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN AND MEMBERS JUST HER DOG WITH THE CALIFORNIA ASSOCIATION OF SANITATION AGENCIES HERE IT'S PART. THANK YOU. A MARINE ON BEHALF OF CIRCLE CALIFORNIA HE'LL BANG CLEAN WATER ACTION. THANK YOU. GENEVIEVE ABATTANT ON BEHALF OF. SURFRIDER FOUNDATION PLASTIC POLLUTION COALITION WILD COAST ZERO WASTE USA SEVENTH GENERATION. ADVISORS. THE FIVE TEARS INSTITUTE. CENTER FOR OCEANIC AWARENESS RESEARCH AND EDUCATION UPSTREAM POLICY AND WISH TOYOTA CHUMASH FOUNDATION AND SUPPORT. THANK YOU. MADAM CHAIR MEMBERS JUST MALANA BEHOFF OF HOG ISLAND OYSTER COMPANY WE ONE OF THE OYSTER GROWERS THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THIS AND IT'S VERY TROUBLING. THANK YOU. I MEAN TO OUR BEHALF OF ENVIRONMENT CALIFORNIA IN SUPPORT. THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE IN SUPPORT OF THIS BILL AT THIS POINT WILL BRING UP ANYONE IN OPPOSITION TO THE BILL. SAME POLICY TO WITNESSES TWO MINUTES. GOOD AFTERNOON MARGARET CLUTCHING A BEHALF CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION OF I APPRECIATE THE AUTHOR BRING THIS BILL FORWARD AND WE'VE HAD SOME ROBUST DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMMITTEE STAFF AND THE CHAIR. APPRECIATE THE TO AMENDMENT SAFE TAKEN WE DO THINK THEY REYES THAT THAT MIGHT RIVERS ARE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE BUT WE DON'T THINK MANDATORY LABELING AT POINT OF SALE IS THE APPROPRIATE SOLUTION. EVEN WITH THE CHANGES THE AUTHOR ACCEPTED TODAY THIS BILL HAS TREMENDOUS LIABILITY FOR RETAILERS AND IT'S PREMATURE ACCORDING TO THE BRAND SCHOOL OF ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES WHO CONVENED A MICROFIBER SUMMIT LAST FALL THEY'RE STILL IDENTIFYING AND REPRIMAND ACKNOWLEDGED KNOWLEDGE GAPS IN WHAT THE MAJOR SOURCES OF MICROFIBER. FIBER POLLUTION ARE. DO WE THINK THIS BILL AS A MANDATORY LABELING CREATES LIABILITY FOR CONSUMERS AND IT REQUIRES NOT ONE A SORRY FOR RETAILERS REQUIRES NOT ONE BUT TO. DIFFERENT LABELS THAT WE DON'T THINK WE'LL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE CONSUMERS EITHER PURCHASING OR WASHING HABITS. SO I WOULD ALSO NOTE THAT CONSUMER LIKE THIS CONSUMERS LIKE THESE MATERIALS AND AND CLOTHING MADE OUT OF THEM THEY'RE OFTEN VERY DURABLE AND LESS EXPENSIVE. THAN A CLOTHING MADE OUT OF WOOL COTTON OR. LINEN OR OTHER NATURAL MATERIALS IN FACT THOSE MATERIALS MAY HAVE DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS SUCH AS MORE WATER YEARS. AND. AND PRODUCING THEM DOESN'T NECESSARILY THAT CREATES OTHER PROBLEMS THAT THIS COMMITTEE HAS BEEN WELL AWARE OF. FINALLY I WOULD ARGUE THAT ANOTHER LABEL ON CLOTHING ADS HAVE KIT WHICH CONSUMERS WILL THROW WEIGHT DOES ADD TO THE WASTE STREAM WHICH IS SOMETHING I WOULD ENCOURAGE ALL OF YOU TO BE SENSITIVE ABOUT OF WHAT AS WELL. SO FOR ALL THESE REASONS THE CALIFORNIA RETAILERS ASSOCIATION ASK FOR NOVA. GOOD AFTERNOON MISTER CHAIRMAN BURST ON CAP KEY MCCUE CAP CAN ASSOCIATE SOME HELP THE CALIFORNIA MANUFACTURERS AND TECHNOLOGY ASSOCIATION ALSO IN RESPECTFUL OPPOSITION. I'VE. FOR THE REASONS STATED BY MS CLOUD STEAM NAM FOR MANUFACTURING PERSPECTIVE THE US CERTAINLY THIS WOULD BE AN ADDED COST AND TIME CONSTRAINT. TO INSURE THAT THESE ARE NOT JUST ONE LABEL BUT TO I'M THINKING TAGS AT WHAT HAVE YOU. ARE AFFIXED TO EACH CLOTHING ITEM FURTHER QUESTIONS ABOUT LIABILITY ON MEN WHO THAT LIABILITY EXTENDS TO REFER MANUFACTURE WERE TO BE ABLE TO COMPLY WITH SUCH PROVISIONS REQUIREMENTS. IN THEN I SHIPS OF SHIPS THOSE MEN ARE CLOTHING ITEMS TO A RETAILER. AND IF A PARTICULAR I HANG TAG COMES OFF OF A PARTICULAR ITEM OR THEY THEN IN VIOLATION ASSOCIATED WITHOUT THAT PARTICULAR CLOTHING ITEM. ARM AND THE REQUIREMENTS. WITH THAT LIABILITY FUND THE RETAILER THE MANUFACTURER BOTH A LOT OF CONCERNS ABOUT THE ATEN AS MISS GOD SEEN THE AND NOTED ON ALSO JUST QUESTION NOT FROM A POLICY PERSPECTIVE. THE BENEFIT OF THOSE BECAUSE WE DO BELIEVE THAT GOT CONSUMERS TO FIND GREAT VALUE IN THESE PARTICULAR CLOTHING OPTIONS OB COST EFFECTIVE BEEN MENDOZA CERTAINLY FUNCTIONAL. I WOULD JUST ARGUE ON THAT SIDE THAT'S NOT NECESSARILY THE BEST WAY TO IMPACTS CHECK OUT THE CONCERNS AND ISSUES. ON AND WE JUST RESPECTFULLY ASK THROUGH NOVO THANK YOU. THANK YOU VERY MUCH IS THERE ANY OTHER OPPOSITION TO THIS BILL IF THERE IS PLEASE COME FORWARD. MADAM VICE CHAIRMAN MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE RAINY PARK AND WE HAVE THE AMERICAN CHEMISTRY COUNCIL IN OPPOSITION. MAN VICE CHAIR MEMBERS COMMITTEE JOE ACT OR BEHAVE THE PLASTICS INDUSTRY ASSOCIATION OPPOSED. THANK YOU. MELISSA WARNER ON BEHALF OF THE RETAIL INDUSTRY LEADERS ASSOCIATION AND OPPOSITION. OUR EIGHT THANK YOU VERY MUCH ANYONE ELSE. OKAY THEN WILL BRING IN APPEAR TO THE DANCE ANYWHERE ANY COMMENTS FROM THE COMMITTEE MEMBERS. NONE OKAY. WHAT I HAVE A COUPLE OF QUICK THANK YOU YOU CAN GET AND I HAVE A COUPLE OF COMMENTS WE ARE HE SAW THIS BILL A NATURAL RESOURCES AND HAD A VERY LENGTHY DEBATE? ON THIS BILL AND SINCE THAT TIME YOU HAVE MADE SOME CHANGES IN THE REQUIREMENTS ON MANUFACTURERS WITH RESPECT TO. AYE THE LABELING REQUIREMENTS WHICH WHICH IS IT'S GOOD AND BAD BECAUSE I THINK ORIGINALLY THEY HAD TO PUT ON THERE THAT THEY WOULD RELEASE MICRO FIBERS AND THAT IT SHOULD BE HAND WASHED. I MAN THAT IS SINCE BEEN REMOVED. SO. FOR ME WHEN. WHEN YOU SAY. THIS. MATERIAL MAY RELEASE MICRO FIBERS BUT YOU DON'T TELL THE CONSUMER WHAT THEY SHOULD DO ABOUT THAT THEN I AM KINDA LEFT TO WONDER WALL WILL THAT CHANGE ANYTHING WILL THEY EVEN READ IT. SOME WELL BECAUSE THEY'RE A LITTLE MORE IN TUNE WITH. THIS TYPE OF ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE BUT MANY OTHERS WILL NOT. IT WOULD BE GREAT IF. THE MANUFACTURING WORLD WOULD COME UP WITH SOMETHING THAT PERHAPS COULD BE MADE PART OF OUR WASHING MACHINES THAT COULD YOU KNOW CATCH THE SORT OF PARTICLES. THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED I HAVEN'T SEEN SOMEONE ON SHARK TANK WITH SOME GREAT IDEA OF YOU KNOW HOW TO DO THIS TO MAKE A ZILLION DOLLARS. BUT THAT HASN'T HAPPENED YET SO. I SHARE YOUR CONCERN. ABOUT THESE PARTICLES GOING INTO OUR WATERWAYS IN THE ENVIRONMENT I REALLY DO. WOULD BE GREAT IF EVERYBODY WERE NATURAL A ARE YOU KNOW GARMENTS BUT THAT DOESN'T HAPPEN AND I'M JUST NOT CONVINCED THAT. LABEL IT LABELING IT BY SAYING THAT IT RELEASES THESE MICRO FIBERS WILL NECESSARILY GET PEOPLE TO ACT. DIFFERENTLY. SO I DON'T KNOW IF THIS BILL IS GONNA CHANGE AT ALL ONCE IT MOVES FROM HERE BUT I JUST WANT YOU KNOW THAT I DO SUPPORT. ON YOUR EFFORTS I'D. I JUST DON'T SUPPORT THIS PARTICULAR BILL BECAUSE I'M NOT CONVINCED IT WILL ACTUALLY CHANGE CONSUMER. BEHAVIOR BUT I HOPE. I HOPE THAT CHANGES IN THE FUTURE WHERE YOU AND I CAN CAN PARTNER IN ONE OF THESE THEM BELL SO. WITH THAT BEING SAID WOULD YOU LIKE TO CLOSE AND THEN I BELIEVE THE CHAIRMAN AND WILL HAVE SOME COMMENTS. THANK YOU. I THINK THAT THE A LABELING LANGUAGE COULD TELL YOU SOME IMPROVEMENTS I THINK WE'RE IN AGREEMENT DARREN WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ON. OF THE SPECIFIC LANGUAGE OF THE BILL AS IT MOVES FORWARD TO TO PASS OUT OF THIS COMMITTEE TODAY BUT TARA I THINK MADAM VICE CHAIR YOU JUST KIND OF PUT YOUR FINGER ON. ON WHAT TO ADD THE FIRST STEP NEEDS TO BE HERE ON AN ISSUE LIKE THIS AND THAT'S RAISING AWARENESS THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT THESE LABELS ARE INTENDED TO DO. OF YOUR CORRECT WE DON'T KNOW ENOUGH. BUT WE KNOW ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THIS IS A VERY SERIOUS PROBLEM. WE KNOW THAT TO SOME LAUNDERING STRATEGIES ARE BETTER THAN OTHERS. BUT THE NUMBER ONE THING THAT THE PUBLIC NEEDS IS AWARENESS ON THIS ISSUE WITH SO THAT WE CAN BEGIN TO THINK ABOUT IT. AND THAT WILL LEAD TO PEOPLE HAVE NOW TO SHARK TANK IN THE. PRODUCING GOT EVEN BETTER SOLUTIONS FORCE BUT AWARENESS IS KEY. AND THAT WITHOUT I RESPECTFULLY ASK YOUR AYE VOTE. CHAU THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR WORKING WITH US. ARM I DO THINK THAT WHAT WE'VE DONE IN TERMS OF LIABILITY DOES LIMIT. TREMENDOUSLY THE AMOUNT OF LIABILITY WHAT WHAT DO THERE I NOR THE AUTHOR WANTED. WAS FOR SOMEBODY TO HAVE BE FINE BECAUSE THE TAG FELL OFF. WITH ONLY ALLOWING DEA'S AG'S. TO PURSUE THIS AND SINCE THEY HAVE A LOT OF OTHER THINGS TO DO. I DON'T BELIEVE THAT THEY WOULD DO SOMETHING UNLESS ARE. THE RETAILER WERE NOT. TO. NOT PUT LABELS ON AT ALL OR THAT MANUFACTURER WE'RE NOT TO PUT LABELS ON AT ALL. AND THAT WAS THE INTENTION OF THAT AMENDMENT AND I THINK THAT DOES LIMIT THE LIABILITY. AS S. B. AUTHOR SAID WE DON'T HAVE A SOLUTION. THIS IS A WAY TO GET PEOPLE TO REALIZE SOMETHING THIS NEEDS TO BE DONE SO WE CAN GET SOMEONE SHARK TANK TARA COME UP WITH A SOLUTION. ARM SO. THAT IT. AND THE REASON WHY. WASH HAND WASH CAME OFF HIS WHICH IS NOT SURE HOW MUCH THAT WOULD HELP EITHER SO. THERE'S A LOT TO BE LEARNED AND I THINK THE FIRST STEP IS EDUCATION. I'M A SCIENTIST I HAD NO IDEA ABOUT THIS UNTIL THIS BILL CAME UP. CELL AND I I FOLLOW A LOT OF STUFF. SO. PLEASE VOTE ONLY. THIS IS ITEM NUMBER TWO AB TWENTY THREE SEVENTY NINE BLOOM.
