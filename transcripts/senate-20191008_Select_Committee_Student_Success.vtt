00:28:23.868 --> 00:28:24.335
YOUR POTENTIAL REALLY IS

00:28:24.402 --> 00:28:25.670
BECAUSE I THINK IT'S MUCH

00:28:25.737 --> 00:28:27.839
GREATER THAN A- 38% FOUR YEAR

00:28:27.906 --> 00:28:31.709
GRADUATION RATE. PROFESSIONAL I.

00:28:31.776 --> 00:28:33.745
IS EVEN THOSE NUMBERS. THE

00:28:33.812 --> 00:28:34.379
UNFORTUNATE PART THERE'S GROWTH

00:28:34.446 --> 00:28:37.682
AND THEN THERE'S THE NUMBERS.

00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:41.820
AND MAYBE YOU CAN SPEAK TO. NO.

00:28:41.886 --> 00:28:43.788
ANP TALK ABOUT BEING DATA

00:28:43.855 --> 00:28:44.389
DRIVEN. THOUSANDS OF KIDS ARE

00:28:44.456 --> 00:28:45.924
STILL DROPPING OUT OF THIS

00:28:45.990 --> 00:28:47.692
UNIVERSITY AND MANY OTHERS

00:28:47.759 --> 00:28:49.694
AROUND THE STATE. DO YOU DO ANY

00:28:49.761 --> 00:28:50.261
KIND OF SYSTEMATIC SURVEY OF

00:28:50.328 --> 00:28:55.733
THOSE STUDENTS TO FIND OUT WHY.

00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:58.103
WE HAVE THANK YOU SENATOR THANK

00:28:58.169 --> 00:28:59.804
YOU FOR THE QUESTION WE HAVE A

00:28:59.871 --> 00:29:01.873
LOT OF STRATEGIES TO ADDRESS

00:29:01.940 --> 00:29:03.775
OUR RETENTION RATES. WE HAVE

00:29:03.842 --> 00:29:06.177
WERE USING DATA ANALYTICS TO

00:29:06.244 --> 00:29:07.812
UNDERSTAND WHY STUDENTS AREN'T

00:29:07.879 --> 00:29:09.948
RETURNING SO FOR EXAMPLE. AS AN

00:29:10.014 --> 00:29:12.050
EXAMPLE OF AND GETTING READY

00:29:12.117 --> 00:29:13.952
FOR THE SPRING TERM. WE HAVE

00:29:14.018 --> 00:29:16.254
DATA THAT WE CAN SEE WHO WERE

00:29:16.321 --> 00:29:17.922
THE STUDENTS WHO WERE HERE IN

00:29:17.989 --> 00:29:18.456
THE FALL BUT HAVE NOT YET

00:29:18.523 --> 00:29:20.158
ENROLLED FOR THE SPRING TERM.

00:29:20.225 --> 00:29:22.093
WE HAVE TARGETED STRATEGIES TO

00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.028
TARGET THOSE STUDENTS TO

00:29:24.095 --> 00:29:25.930
UNDERSTAND WHY THEY ARE NOT

00:29:25.997 --> 00:29:26.631
RETURNING WHAT IS THE REASON IS

00:29:26.698 --> 00:29:29.868
IT IS IT A FINANCIAL REASON OR

00:29:29.934 --> 00:29:32.036
DO OTHER REASONS. AS FAR AS A

00:29:32.103 --> 00:29:37.942
SERVICE SURVEY I CAN. DEFER TO

00:29:38.009 --> 00:29:38.376
MY COLLEAGUES TO DO

00:29:38.443 --> 00:29:41.813
SPECIFICALLY SPEAK OF SURVEYS.

00:29:41.880 --> 00:29:43.882
ANYBODY HAVE ANY INSIGHT ABOUT

00:29:43.948 --> 00:29:44.382
DAY ACTUALLY TALKING TO

00:29:44.449 --> 00:29:45.817
STUDENTS WHO HAVE DRAWN DOWN.

00:29:45.884 --> 00:29:47.919
LET ME JUST ENCOURAGE YOU TO

00:29:47.986 --> 00:29:48.520
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT ATKINS I

00:29:48.586 --> 00:29:50.188
APPRECIATE IN YOUR METRICS HERE

00:29:50.255 --> 00:29:52.123
WE TALK ABOUT DATA DRIVEN

00:29:52.190 --> 00:29:53.992
DECISION MAKING. AND THERE'S

00:29:54.058 --> 00:29:55.894
LOTS OF WAYS TO APPLY THAT BOTH

00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:56.494
INTO MAKING CLASSES AVAILABLE

00:29:56.561 --> 00:29:59.797
IF STUDENTS WANT TO TAKE. IT'S

00:29:59.864 --> 00:30:00.431
ALSO TRYING TO UNDERSTAND WHAT

00:30:00.498 --> 00:30:01.900
THOSE BARRIERS ARE THAT MADE

00:30:01.966 --> 00:30:02.400
THEM SAY THEY THEY COULD

00:30:02.467 --> 00:30:04.135
CONTINUE CERTAINLY FINANCIAL

00:30:04.202 --> 00:30:06.037
ISSUES WILL ALWAYS BE IN PLAY.

00:30:06.104 --> 00:30:08.239
BUT WE HEAR A LOT FROM STUDENTS

00:30:08.306 --> 00:30:08.907
TO THAT THEY COULDN'T GET THEIR

00:30:08.973 --> 00:30:11.910
CLASSES THEY COULDN'T GET THERE

00:30:11.976 --> 00:30:12.477
WAS THERE WAS A PREREQUISITE

00:30:12.544 --> 00:30:13.811
REQUIRED AND IT WASN'T

00:30:13.878 --> 00:30:15.847
AVAILABLE. NOW IS GONNA SET

00:30:15.914 --> 00:30:16.414
THEM BACK FOR A SEMESTER OR

00:30:16.481 --> 00:30:18.183
YEAR WITH AT GREAT COST AND

00:30:18.249 --> 00:30:20.084
EXPENSE. I THINK WE WOULD

00:30:20.151 --> 00:30:20.618
BENEFIT FROM TRYING TO

00:30:20.685 --> 00:30:24.055
UNDERSTAND. THAT STARTLING

00:30:24.122 --> 00:30:24.656
NUMBER THAT WE DON'T LIKE TO

00:30:24.722 --> 00:30:25.890
TALK ABOUT MUCH BUT IT'S TRUE.

00:30:25.957 --> 00:30:28.226
IT'S NOT JUST HUNDREDS IT'S

00:30:28.293 --> 00:30:29.994
TENS OF THOUSANDS EVERY YEAR

00:30:30.061 --> 00:30:31.963
STATEWIDE DROPOUT. AND IT BE

00:30:32.030 --> 00:30:33.965
GOOD FOR IF WE HAD THE DATA TO

00:30:34.032 --> 00:30:35.900
CAN UNDERSTAND THAT. I AM VERY

00:30:35.967 --> 00:30:38.069
SUPPORTIVE AND- GREAT PHRASE

00:30:38.136 --> 00:30:39.971
HERE TAKE THIRTY CAMPAIGN AND

00:30:40.038 --> 00:30:42.173
THAT THE NUMBERS THAT YOU HAVE

00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:42.707
MOVED ON FRESHMAN IS X.

00:30:42.774 --> 00:30:44.042
EXTRAORDINARY. EXTRAORDINARY

00:30:44.108 --> 00:30:46.311
AND I'D LOVE TO KNOW MORE ABOUT

00:30:46.377 --> 00:30:48.079
THAT ADVERTISING THAT WENT INTO

00:30:48.146 --> 00:30:49.814
THAT THE PROMOTION OF THAT

00:30:49.881 --> 00:30:51.983
BECAUSE WHAT WHAT'S STUNNING

00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:52.617
NUMBERS. THAT YOU SHARED WITH

00:30:52.684 --> 00:30:55.853
US. TODAY GOING FROM 22%

00:30:55.920 --> 00:31:00.124
FRESHMAN TAKING. 3261% THAT'S

00:31:00.191 --> 00:31:06.231
INCREDIBLE. THE IF I MAY

00:31:06.297 --> 00:31:08.233
SENATOR IF WITH RESPECT TO THE

00:31:08.299 --> 00:31:08.933
CLASS SCHEDULE WE USE BOTH DATA

00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:10.335
ANALYTICS AND ALSO INFORMATION

00:31:10.401 --> 00:31:10.868
FROM ADVISERS TO STUDENTS

00:31:10.935 --> 00:31:12.136
SENATE DEPARTMENTS TO MAKE SURE

00:31:12.203 --> 00:31:12.704
THAT. THE CLASSES THAT THE

00:31:12.770 --> 00:31:14.272
STUDENTS NEED ARE OFFERED IN

00:31:14.339 --> 00:31:15.907
THE CLASS SCHEDULE WE HAVE.

00:31:15.974 --> 00:31:16.541
WORKED VERY HARD WITH ALL OF

00:31:16.608 --> 00:31:18.276
OUR DEPARTMENTS AND COLLEGES TO

00:31:18.343 --> 00:31:19.978
INSURE THAT WE EXPANDED THE

00:31:20.044 --> 00:31:22.180
TIMES THAT THE CLASSES ARE

00:31:22.247 --> 00:31:22.747
OFFERED FROM EARLY IN THE

00:31:22.814 --> 00:31:24.215
MORNING TO LATE IN THE EVENING.

00:31:24.282 --> 00:31:26.150
EVEN ON THE WEEKENDS SO WE HAVE

00:31:26.217 --> 00:31:28.319
MORE CLASSES EARLIER IN THE

00:31:28.386 --> 00:31:30.288
MORNING WE HAVE MORE CLASSES

00:31:30.355 --> 00:31:30.888
LATER IN THE EVENING SO MORE

00:31:30.955 --> 00:31:33.891
MORE CLASSES. ON THE WEEKENDS.

00:31:33.958 --> 00:31:34.425
TO ADDRESS THAT AS MUCH AS

00:31:34.492 --> 00:31:36.227
POSSIBLE. OUR AS I. HAS JUST

00:31:36.294 --> 00:31:38.263
INITIATED A PROGRAM TO. TRY TO

00:31:38.329 --> 00:31:40.198
UNDERSTAND THE NEEDS OF NON

00:31:40.265 --> 00:31:42.066
NONTRADITIONAL STUDENTS AS WELL

00:31:42.133 --> 00:31:44.369
SO WE WILL PARTNER WITH THEM TO

00:31:44.435 --> 00:31:45.903
BETTER UNDERSTAND THOSE NEEDS

00:31:45.970 --> 00:31:47.905
FOR CLASS. NOT A GREAT ANYWAYS

00:31:47.972 --> 00:31:48.506
I CERTAINLY HERE THAT I HEARD

00:31:48.573 --> 00:31:53.945
THIS MORNING. AND BY MEETING.

00:31:54.012 --> 00:31:54.445
WITH SOME OF THE STUDENT

00:31:54.512 --> 00:31:57.949
LEADERS AND LET ME JUST TODAY.

00:31:58.016 --> 00:32:00.084
FINISH UP WITH THE- ONE MORE

00:32:00.151 --> 00:32:00.618
OBSERVATION AND THEN ASK A

00:32:00.685 --> 00:32:02.186
QUESTION. IN THE SUMMER

00:32:02.253 --> 00:32:02.720
COMPLETION INITIATIVE IS

00:32:02.787 --> 00:32:04.289
SOMETHING THAT I KNOW THAT WE

00:32:04.355 --> 00:32:04.889
HAVE BEEN VERY SUPPORTIVE OF

00:32:04.956 --> 00:32:06.057
TRYING TO FIND A WAY TO. TO

00:32:06.124 --> 00:32:06.624
FIND AND TO HELP YOU MENTION

00:32:06.691 --> 00:32:08.259
YOU GOT PRIVATE MONEY TO DO

00:32:08.326 --> 00:32:10.028
THAT SO THAT'S A DOUBLE PRAISE

00:32:10.094 --> 00:32:10.595
FOR. THAT ACCOMPLISHMENT I

00:32:10.662 --> 00:32:13.898
THINK THAT. MANY OF US WITH

00:32:13.965 --> 00:32:15.900
LOOK FOR WAYS TO TRY TO SUPPORT

00:32:15.967 --> 00:32:18.002
THE SUMMER INITIATIVES WITH

00:32:18.069 --> 00:32:19.937
FUNDING FROM THE STATE. AND I

00:32:20.004 --> 00:32:22.407
HOPE WE CAN CONTINUE THAT

00:32:22.473 --> 00:32:23.007
CONVERSATION FIGURE OUT A WAY

00:32:23.074 --> 00:32:24.042
TO DO THAT BECAUSE- TO TAKE

00:32:24.108 --> 00:32:26.344
THOSE THREE HUNDRED AND TWENTY

00:32:26.411 --> 00:32:26.978
SEVEN STUDENTS THERE WERE EIGHT

00:32:27.045 --> 00:32:28.313
UNITS AWAY FROM A DEGREE AND WE

00:32:28.379 --> 00:32:29.914
KNOW THE DIFFERENCE WITH NO

00:32:29.981 --> 00:32:30.515
DEGREE DEGREE IT'S A MASSIVE

00:32:30.581 --> 00:32:34.052
DIFFERENCE ECONOMICALLY. AND TO

00:32:34.118 --> 00:32:34.652
BE ABLE TO GET THEM OVER THE

00:32:34.719 --> 00:32:35.987
TOP WITH THAT SUMMER PROGRAM IS

00:32:36.054 --> 00:32:38.256
INCREDIBLY. VALUABLE FOR THEM

00:32:38.323 --> 00:32:40.058
AND FOR THE STATE AND I'D

00:32:40.124 --> 00:32:41.993
CERTAINLY LIKE TO FIND A WAY TO

00:32:42.060 --> 00:32:44.062
SUPPORT THE EFFORTS WITH PUBLIC

00:32:44.128 --> 00:32:45.930
DOLLARS NOT JUST YOUR SUCCESS

00:32:45.997 --> 00:32:47.932
IN RAISING. A PRIVATE DOLLARS

00:32:47.999 --> 00:32:49.901
BUT MY POINT FINAL QUESTION AND

00:32:49.967 --> 00:32:52.337
MAYBE THIS WILL CONTINUE. WITH

00:32:52.403 --> 00:32:52.937
OTHER FOLKS THAT ARE GOING TO

00:32:53.004 --> 00:32:58.042
TESTIFY. IS SHE IS IT IS THE

00:32:58.109 --> 00:32:58.643
ISSUE OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM

00:32:58.710 --> 00:33:00.011
THE COMMITMENT THE PLEDGE. IT'S

00:33:00.078 --> 00:33:01.913
ONE THING TO SEE AN ENCOURAGING

00:33:01.979 --> 00:33:04.015
AND ENCOURAGE MORE UNITS TO BE

00:33:04.082 --> 00:33:05.983
TAKEN. IT'S ANOTHER THING TO

00:33:06.050 --> 00:33:06.584
HAVE A COMMITMENT BETWEEN THE

00:33:06.651 --> 00:33:08.119
INSTITUTION A STUDENT THAT SAYS

00:33:08.186 --> 00:33:10.321
IF A STUDENT WANTS TO GET

00:33:10.388 --> 00:33:11.923
THROUGH IN FOUR YEARS AND

00:33:11.989 --> 00:33:13.925
MAINTAINS A C. AVERAGE OR C.

00:33:13.991 --> 00:33:16.260
PLUS AVERAGE. AND TAKES THIRTY

00:33:16.327 --> 00:33:16.761
UNITS THAT WE'RE GONNA

00:33:16.828 --> 00:33:18.062
GUARANTEE THAT THEY CAN DO IT.

00:33:18.129 --> 00:33:20.298
AND THAT'S THE ESSENCE OF THE

00:33:20.365 --> 00:33:20.865
PROMISE PROGRAM IS A PLEDGE

00:33:20.932 --> 00:33:24.302
FROM BOTH SIDES. AND IT IT DE

00:33:24.369 --> 00:33:24.936
IT DOES CREATE PRESSURES ON THE

00:33:25.002 --> 00:33:28.239
INSTITUTION. AND I KNOW THAT

00:33:28.306 --> 00:33:30.241
IT'S SACKS STATED AT SAN JOSE

00:33:30.308 --> 00:33:30.775
STATE WHEN THOSE G. THE

00:33:30.842 --> 00:33:32.410
UNIVERSITY LEADERSHIP AGREED TO

00:33:32.477 --> 00:33:34.445
PROMOTE THAT PROMISE PROGRAM

00:33:34.512 --> 00:33:35.079
AND SAID THE KIDS YOU WANNA GET

00:33:35.146 --> 00:33:36.180
OUT IN FOUR YEARS. YOU MAKE

00:33:36.247 --> 00:33:38.349
THESE COMMITMENTS WE MAKE THESE

00:33:38.416 --> 00:33:40.118
AND WE'RE GONNA MAKE IT TO A

00:33:40.184 --> 00:33:42.153
TOGETHER THAT'S IT THAT'S AN

00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:46.057
INCREDIBLE POWERFUL PARTNERSHIP.

00:33:46.124 --> 00:33:46.557
GOING FORWARD AND I I'M

00:33:46.624 --> 00:33:48.025
SURPRISED THAT THAT. THAT HE

00:33:48.092 --> 00:33:50.027
WOULD POMONA TAKES AN X. SIX OR

00:33:50.094 --> 00:33:52.096
SEVEN MOUSE CLICKS. ON IT. ON

00:33:52.163 --> 00:33:54.031

START BY SAYING THAT ABSOLUTELY

00:34:34.972 --> 00:34:36.474
WHEN WE NEED TO DO A LOT BETTER

00:34:36.541 --> 00:34:38.309
OUR WE ARE IMPLEMENTED

00:34:38.376 --> 00:34:38.943

NEED TO DO A MUCH BETTER JOB TO

RESPOND AS YOU'VE TALKED ABOUT

00:35:54.418 --> 00:35:54.986
THE PROMISED. LAND IN FACT. THE

00:35:55.052 --> 00:35:56.320
UNDERLYING PHILOSOPHY AND THE

00:35:56.387 --> 00:35:56.921
VALUE OF THE PROMISE PROGRAM.

00:35:56.988 --> 00:35:58.589
FROM CAL POLY POMONA'S

00:35:58.656 --> 00:36:02.226
PERSPECTIVE IS WHAT ALSO G. I.

00:36:02.293 --> 00:36:04.228
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IS ABOUT.

00:36:04.295 --> 00:36:06.230
BECAUSE WE WHILE WE CERTAINLY

00:36:06.297 --> 00:36:08.332
WILL. CONTINUE TO BE

00:36:08.399 --> 00:36:10.234
INTENTIONAL BUT THOSE STUDENTS.

00:36:10.301 --> 00:36:14.405
WHO CAN AND WILL MAKE THAT.

00:36:14.472 --> 00:36:16.607
DEFINITIVE PLEDGE WHAT WE FOUND

00:36:16.674 --> 00:36:18.442
AS WE LOOK TO SOME OF THE DATA

00:36:18.509 --> 00:36:20.344
FOR THE STUDENTS WHO STARTED

00:36:20.411 --> 00:36:22.446
AND CONTINUE THE PROGRAM. IS IT

00:36:22.513 --> 00:36:24.348
MORE OFTEN THEY CHANGED MAJORS.

00:36:24.415 --> 00:36:28.252
THEY ENDED UP DECIDING FOR.

00:36:28.319 --> 00:36:30.655
OFTEN TIMES FINANCIAL REASONS

00:36:30.721 --> 00:36:32.590
THAT THEY NEEDED TO BOTH WORK

00:36:32.657 --> 00:36:36.427
PART TIME AND GO TO SCHOOL. AND

00:36:36.494 --> 00:36:38.696
SO WHAT THE LIST THE CALIFORNIA

00:36:38.763 --> 00:36:42.433
PROMISE BUT ALSO. THE BORDER.

00:36:42.500 --> 00:36:44.402
GRADUATION INITIATIVE THE

00:36:44.468 --> 00:36:46.404
TWENTY TWENTY FIVE. IT HAS

00:36:46.470 --> 00:36:48.539
ALLOWED THE CAMPUSES TO DEVELOP

00:36:48.606 --> 00:36:50.474
THE INFRASTRUCTURE. I THINK

00:36:50.541 --> 00:36:52.543
THAT WHAT WE HAVE HAVE SHOWN.

00:36:52.610 --> 00:36:56.347
IS THAT THE ABILITY TO TRACK

00:36:56.414 --> 00:36:58.349
STUDENTS THE ABILITY TO FOLLOW

00:36:58.416 --> 00:37:00.418
WHAT THE STUDENTS. JUST THE

00:37:00.484 --> 00:37:02.553
BILLY CHAT. ALONE HAS SHOWN.

00:37:02.620 --> 00:37:06.524
THAT THE FUNDING THAT WE

00:37:06.591 --> 00:37:08.426
RECEIVE FROM THE STATE. HAS

00:37:08.492 --> 00:37:10.595
BEEN THE SENSUAL. TO CREATE AN

00:37:10.661 --> 00:37:12.663
INSTITUTIONAL CULTURAL SHIFT.

00:37:12.730 --> 00:37:16.367
AND WHAT YOU'RE SEEING IS THE-

00:37:16.434 --> 00:37:18.603
DEVELOPMENT OF THESE ELEMENTS

00:37:18.669 --> 00:37:20.571
THAT WE THINK ARE CRITICAL AND

00:37:20.638 --> 00:37:22.740
THE NEED TO WORK. TOGETHER AND

00:37:22.807 --> 00:37:26.344
SO WHETHER IT'S THE CALIFORNIA

00:37:26.410 --> 00:37:28.579
PROMISE WOULD JUST SAID THERE'S

00:37:28.646 --> 00:37:30.414
REALLY BEEN A FOUNDATION. FOR

00:37:30.481 --> 00:37:32.583
OUR THINKING HERE AT CAL POLY

00:37:32.650 --> 00:37:34.752
POMONA ABOUT HOW WE STRUCTURE.

00:37:34.819 --> 00:37:38.489
THE BROADER NETWORK OF. OF

00:37:38.556 --> 00:37:40.691
SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES. SO

00:37:40.758 --> 00:37:48.466
THAT YOU WILL SEE ARE THE. KIND

00:37:48.532 --> 00:37:52.770
OF PROGRESS. YOU MADE MENTION

00:37:52.837 --> 00:37:54.905
IN TERMS OF THESE NUMBERS DID

00:37:54.972 --> 00:37:56.540

00:37:58.509 --> 00:37:59.076

LOOKING OUT WHAT WILL IT HEY.

00:38:08.519 --> 00:38:10.755
IT THEN ALLOWED US TO STEP BACK

00:38:10.821 --> 00:38:14.458
AND THINK IN A MUCH MORE

00:38:14.525 --> 00:38:18.462
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK MANNER AS

00:38:18.529 --> 00:38:18.963
TO HOW WE WERE GOING TO

00:38:19.030 --> 00:38:20.464
OPERATIONALIZE AND IMPLEMENT.

00:38:20.531 --> 00:38:22.767
AND NOW THAT WE HAVE A PATH

00:38:22.833 --> 00:38:26.537
FORWARD YOU WILL SEE THE

00:38:26.604 --> 00:38:28.773
CAMPUSES GOING ABOVE AND BEYOND

00:38:28.839 --> 00:38:32.476

00:38:32.543 --> 00:38:34.612
ARE AND SO WE'RE VERY EXCITED

00:38:34.679 --> 00:38:36.714

KEY TO ATTEND THE GRADUATION.

00:38:46.957 --> 00:38:48.926
SO AS WE MOVE INTO THE NEXT

00:38:48.993 --> 00:38:52.463
BUDGET CYCLE WHAT I HOPE AND

SEE SOME NUMBER APPEAR THAT TO

00:38:58.969 --> 00:39:00.871
TELLS US WHAT EXACTLY WE NEED

00:39:00.938 --> 00:39:02.873

PEOPLE THROUGH THE PIPELINE A

00:39:19.156 --> 00:39:20.891
LITTLE FASTER. WITH THE KIND OF

00:39:20.958 --> 00:39:22.793
DEGREE THAT'S GOING TO PRODUCE

00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:24.862

WHAT WE'VE ALSO RECOGNIZE AND

00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:48.719
THEN THE BEAUTY. OF THE

00:39:48.786 --> 00:39:49.286
GRADUATION NISH IT HAS BEEN

00:39:49.353 --> 00:39:54.792
THAT THE CAMPUSES. I'VE BEEN

00:39:54.859 --> 00:39:56.694
ALLOWED TO INDIVIDUALIZE THEIR

00:39:56.761 --> 00:39:57.361
NEEDS BECAUSE FOR SOME CAMPUSES

00:39:57.428 --> 00:39:58.929

00:39:58.996 --> 00:40:01.031
LOWER FOR KAPLAN MONNING GETS

00:40:01.098 --> 00:40:02.666
HIGHER AND SO WHAT THE

00:40:02.733 --> 00:40:03.200
GRADUATION INITIATIVE HAS

00:40:03.267 --> 00:40:06.771
REALLY. IN COVERAGE IS RATHER

00:40:06.837 --> 00:40:08.873
THAN A COOKIE CUTTER APPROACH

00:40:08.939 --> 00:40:12.643
TO THE WAY WE WOULD. MEET OUR

00:40:12.710 --> 00:40:14.912
GOALS AND MAKE SURE THAT OUR

00:40:14.979 --> 00:40:16.914
STUDENTS SUCCEED IS IT THE

00:40:16.981 --> 00:40:20.785
CAMPUSES ARE ABLE TO PUT THE

00:40:20.851 --> 00:40:22.853
DOLLARS BASED ON FORD THERE IS

00:40:22.920 --> 00:40:24.922
THE GREATEST NEED AND SO YOU'RE

00:40:24.989 --> 00:40:26.590
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT. ACCOUNT POLY

00:40:26.657 --> 00:40:28.592
POMONA IT WAS LOOKING AT

00:40:28.659 --> 00:40:29.160
ADVISORS AND CHANGING THAT

00:40:29.226 --> 00:40:31.128
RATIO FOR ANOTHER CAMPUS. THAT

00:40:31.195 --> 00:40:34.698
ADVISING SYSTEM IS ALREADY BEEN

00:40:34.765 --> 00:40:36.934
IN PLACE AND SO THEIR DOLLARS

00:40:37.001 --> 00:40:38.969
ARE GOING TO GO TO AREAS THAT

00:40:39.036 --> 00:40:42.706
THEY HAVE THAT OUR GREATEST

00:40:42.773 --> 00:40:44.742
NEED SO WE REALLY APPRECIATE.

00:40:44.809 --> 00:40:48.679
THE LEGISLATURE FOR THE SUPPORT

00:40:48.746 --> 00:40:50.815
FOR THE GRADUATION ISSUE TWENTY

00:40:50.881 --> 00:40:51.415
TWENTY FIVE WELL WE OBVIOUSLY

00:40:51.482 --> 00:40:52.883
NEED TO GET YOU MORE MONEY WELL

00:40:52.950 --> 00:40:57.054
YOU KNOW. WHAT MONA WILL NEVER

00:40:57.121 --> 00:41:01.058
TURN DOWN. BUT I THINK I THINK

00:41:01.125 --> 00:41:02.960
IT YOU KNOW AS WE LOOK AT AND

00:41:03.027 --> 00:41:03.627
I'M AS YOU PROBABLY KNOW I'M ON

00:41:03.694 --> 00:41:06.697
THE FUTURE OF WORK COMMISSION

00:41:06.764 --> 00:41:08.866
AND WHAT WE RECOGNIZE IS THAT

00:41:08.933 --> 00:41:10.968
IS A C. ISSUE SYSTEM OF FOUR

00:41:11.035 --> 00:41:12.736
HUNDRED FIFTY THOUSAND STUDENTS.

00:41:12.803 --> 00:41:14.972
AND THE ECONOMY OF CALIFORNIA

00:41:15.039 --> 00:41:17.007
BEING FUELED BY THE STUDENTS

00:41:17.074 --> 00:41:20.711
INTO THAT INTO THAT MAINSTREAM

00:41:20.778 --> 00:41:24.949
THAT THE ENTIRE. TWENTY THREE

00:41:25.015 --> 00:41:28.719
CAMPUS SYSTEM IS CAN IS NEEDING

00:41:28.786 --> 00:41:30.821
TO CONTINUE TO LOOK AT THE WAYS

00:41:30.888 --> 00:41:32.823
IN WHICH WE CAN MOST

00:41:32.890 --> 00:41:34.859
APPROPRIATELY. MEET THE NEEDS

00:41:34.925 --> 00:41:36.927
OF OUR REGION AND OF OUR LOCAL

00:41:36.994 --> 00:41:40.698
LOCAL AREA SO THIS I THINK AS

00:41:40.764 --> 00:41:41.332
I'M BUT TALK WITH SOME OF MY

00:41:41.398 --> 00:41:43.100
COLLEAGUES IN OTHER STATES THIS

00:41:43.167 --> 00:41:48.706
HAS BEEN. THE MOST INNOVATIVE

00:41:48.772 --> 00:41:50.875
AND I THINK IMPACTFUL PIECE OF

00:41:50.941 --> 00:41:52.776
LEGISLATION OF THE SUPPORT OF

00:41:52.843 --> 00:41:54.712
THE G. I. TWENTY TWENTY FIVE IN

00:41:54.778 --> 00:41:55.312
HIGHER EDUCATION WELL I THINK

00:41:55.379 --> 00:41:55.880
MAYBE WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS

00:41:55.946 --> 00:41:59.183
LOOK AT. THE BUDGET BUT

00:41:59.250 --> 00:42:00.985
UNFORTUNATELY THE BUDGET TO

00:42:01.051 --> 00:42:02.987
ZERO SUM GAME SO WHICH IS VERY

00:42:03.053 --> 00:42:03.621
DIFFICULT IT HAS TO BALANCE AND

00:42:03.687 --> 00:42:04.788
WE DON'T PRINT MONEY. BUT

00:42:04.855 --> 00:42:07.091
PERHAPS WHAT WE NEED TO LOOK AT

00:42:07.157 --> 00:42:08.893
IS DIRECTING A LITTLE BIT MORE

00:42:08.959 --> 00:42:10.895
MONEY. AT THE INSTITUTION

00:42:10.961 --> 00:42:11.528
LITTLE THE BILL WOULD ALLOW THE

00:42:11.595 --> 00:42:13.130
CHANCELLOR TO FOR COUNSELING

00:42:13.197 --> 00:42:15.065
PURPOSES THAT WILL ALLOW THE

00:42:15.132 --> 00:42:16.800
CHANCELLOR TO REDIRECT MONEY.

00:42:16.867 --> 00:42:19.036
TO THOSE CAMPUSES IN THE

00:42:19.103 --> 00:42:20.971
ADDITIONAL COUNSELING RESOURCES

00:42:21.038 --> 00:42:23.007
FOR WHATEVER REASON SO ANYWAY

00:42:23.073 --> 00:42:24.909
I'M NOT GOING TO BELABOR THIS

00:42:24.975 --> 00:42:25.509
BUT LOOK FORWARD TO HAVING A

00:42:25.576 --> 00:42:27.144
CONVERSATION. JANET IT'S A IT'S

00:42:27.211 --> 00:42:28.879
A GOOD POINT AND I JUST TO

00:42:28.946 --> 00:42:30.814
CLARIFY YOUR TIME ACADEMIC

00:42:30.881 --> 00:42:31.415
COUNSELOR WE'RE GOING TO DEAL

00:42:31.482 --> 00:42:32.816
WITH SOME OTHER COUNSELING

00:42:32.883 --> 00:42:34.919
ISSUES INVOLVED ACADEMIC JOBS

01:10:52.615 --> 01:10:53.182
HEAR AT THE CAMPUS WE WERE AT

01:10:53.248 --> 01:10:54.683
YESTERDAY THE DATA THAT THEY

01:10:54.750 --> 01:10:56.819
GOT FROM THEIR STUDENT BODY WAS

01:10:56.885 --> 01:10:58.621
THAT. OF 14% ATKINS AT

01:10:58.687 --> 01:11:02.424
CONSIDERED TAKING THEIR OWN

LIFE. THE PAST YEAR 14% SO

01:11:06.495 --> 01:11:10.666
THERE'S THAT. JUST SAID WHICH

01:11:12.568 --> 01:11:13.102
WHAT WE ARE ALL FOCUSING ON

01:11:13.168 --> 01:11:14.670
HERE ACCOUNT MIKE THE MONA IS

01:11:14.737 --> 01:11:16.739
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT WHEN

01:11:16.805 --> 01:11:20.442
STUDENTS FIRST ARRIVE SO WE

01:11:20.509 --> 01:11:22.378
HAVE TOTALLY CHANGED OUR

01:11:22.444 --> 01:11:24.613
ORIENTATION PROGRAM OF FOCUSING

01:11:24.680 --> 01:11:26.782
ON SPEECH STUDENTS AS THEY COME

01:11:26.849 --> 01:11:30.386
INTO THE UNIVERSITY SO THAT

01:11:30.452 --> 01:11:32.521
THEY UNDERSTAND THAT THERE ARE

01:11:32.588 --> 01:11:34.623
NUMBER OF AREAS THAT MAY AFFECT

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:36.358
YOUR ABILITY TO MATRICULATING.

01:11:36.425 --> 01:11:38.460
IN THERE MAY BE PHYSICAL THERE

01:11:38.527 --> 01:11:40.529
MAY BE MENTAL HEALTH THERE MAY

01:11:40.596 --> 01:11:42.698
BE JUST NOT KNOWING HOW TO

01:11:42.765 --> 01:11:46.368
NAVIGATE THIS LARGE UNIVERSITY

01:11:46.435 --> 01:11:48.470
AND SO THE FOCUS HAS BEEN TO AS

01:11:48.537 --> 01:11:50.539
MUCH AS POSSIBLE WITH THE

01:11:50.606 --> 01:11:52.474
RESOURCES THAT WE HAVE TO BE

01:11:52.541 --> 01:11:56.745
ABLE. TO MAKE THE STUDENTS

01:11:56.812 --> 01:12:00.482
AWARE. ON AN AS NEEDED BASIS

01:12:00.549 --> 01:12:01.150
BECAUSE MANY TIMES THE STUDENTS

01:12:01.216 --> 01:12:04.386
AREN'T IT'S NOT UNTIL THEY GO

01:12:04.453 --> 01:12:05.020

01:12:05.087 --> 01:12:08.457

AFFORD IT. RIGHT AND THE REASON

01:15:13.041 --> 01:15:13.575
I ASKED THE QUESTION YOU KNOW

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:16.612
WE- AS I SAID IT WAS ALWAYS

01:15:16.678 --> 01:15:17.212
HANNAH HAD COME BUT WITH THE

01:15:17.279 --> 01:15:18.747
BUDGET WE WERE ABLE TO PUT

01:15:18.814 --> 01:15:19.281
ABOUT SIXTY FIVE MILLION

01:15:19.348 --> 01:15:20.616
DOLLARS IN THE BUDGET THIS

01:15:20.682 --> 01:15:22.751
YEAR. FOR ADDITIONAL MENTAL

01:15:22.818 --> 01:15:24.720
HEALTH SERVICES SOME OF THAT

01:15:24.786 --> 01:15:26.588
HIGHER EDUCATION NOT NEARLY.

01:15:26.655 --> 01:15:28.590
ENOUGH FOR HIGHER EDUCATION

01:15:28.657 --> 01:15:29.124
FRANKLY NOT NEARLY NEARLY

01:15:29.191 --> 01:15:32.628
ENOUGH FOR K. THROUGH TWELVE. I

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.630
ASKED THE QUESTION BECAUSE I

01:15:34.696 --> 01:15:36.698
REALIZE ALTHOUGH WE NEED TO DO

01:15:36.765 --> 01:15:38.867
MORE FOR THE UC SYSTEM AS WELL

01:15:38.934 --> 01:15:40.836
BUT THERE IS A- WHAT ABOUT A

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:42.604
MAJOR DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE UC

01:15:42.671 --> 01:15:43.105
SYSTEM IN THE C. ISSUE

01:15:43.171 --> 01:15:44.873

01:15:47.109 --> 01:15:48.844
OF PROGRAMS THAT. THE UC

01:15:48.911 --> 01:15:54.783
PROVIDES SO. FOR ITS. STUDENTS

01:15:54.850 --> 01:15:58.654
PROBABLY MANDATES AS I RECALL.

01:15:58.720 --> 01:15:59.121
AND FOR C. ISSUE IS

01:15:59.187 --> 01:15:59.721
HISTORICALLY NOT DONE THAT DO

01:15:59.788 --> 01:16:00.188
WE HAVE ANY IDEA WHAT

01:16:00.255 --> 01:16:00.923
PERCENTAGE OF YOUR- STUDENT

01:16:00.989 --> 01:16:02.891

MENTAL HEALTH SERVICE COVERAGE

01:16:05.460 --> 01:16:08.764
ONE WAY OR THE OTHER. I DON'T

01:16:08.830 --> 01:16:09.398
HAVE THAT NUMBER WITH WE CAN

01:16:09.464 --> 01:16:11.099
GET IT IT'LL BE SOMETHING THAT

01:16:11.166 --> 01:16:12.734

THE BUDGET CONVERSATION THIS

01:16:16.672 --> 01:16:17.172
YEAR. BECAUSE I THINK WE'RE

LEADERSHIP IS NOT JUST STARTED

01:29:36.804 --> 01:29:38.773
YOUR ONE BUT IN EACH OF THESE

01:29:38.840 --> 01:29:40.475
AREAS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT

01:29:40.541 --> 01:29:42.610
HOUSING. IN A IN SECURITY FOOD

01:29:42.677 --> 01:29:46.314

GETTING BETTER THINGS HAVE

01:29:54.388 --> 01:29:54.956
GOTTEN WORSE. FOR STUDENTS HOW

01:29:55.022 --> 01:29:58.226
HOW WOULD YOU ASSESS THAT. WELL

01:29:58.292 --> 01:29:58.693
WHEN IT COMES TO FOOD

01:29:58.760 --> 01:30:00.728
INSECURITY I DEFINITELY FEEL

01:30:00.795 --> 01:30:01.329
LIKE THERE'S BEEN AN INCREASE

01:30:01.395 --> 01:30:04.232
IN RESOURCES AVAILABLE FROM MY

01:30:04.298 --> 01:30:04.866
FIRST YEAR I HAD NO IDEA WHAT

01:30:04.932 --> 01:30:06.734
CAL FRESH WAS BUT THROUGHOUT MY

01:30:06.801 --> 01:30:08.703
INVOLVEMENT IN THROUGHOUT ON

01:30:08.770 --> 01:30:10.438
THE ORIENTATION SERVICES. THAT

01:30:10.505 --> 01:30:12.340
TRYING TO EXPOSE MORE STUDENTS

01:30:12.406 --> 01:30:12.874
TO OPTIONS THAT THEY HAVE

01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:14.642
AVAILABLE THROUGH COW FRESH

01:30:14.709 --> 01:30:16.444
THROUGH THE FOOD PANTRY. SO I

01:30:16.511 --> 01:30:18.379
REALLY DO FEEL LIKE OUR

01:30:18.446 --> 01:30:18.980
RESPONSE TO FOOD AND SECURITY

01:30:19.046 --> 01:30:20.548
HAS BEEN PRETTY ROBUST. AND I

01:30:20.615 --> 01:30:22.750
THINK THAT WE'RE SUPPORTING OUR

01:30:22.817 --> 01:30:24.519
STUDENTS AS MUCH AS WE CAN AT

01:30:24.585 --> 01:30:26.387
THIS POINT. I OF COURSE THE

01:30:26.454 --> 01:30:26.988
NEXT BIGGEST CHALLENGE I FEEL

01:30:27.054 --> 01:30:28.723
LIKE FOR US IS HOUSING AND

01:30:28.790 --> 01:30:30.591
SECURITY EVEN THOUGH WE CAN

01:30:30.658 --> 01:30:32.593
COLLABORATE AS MUCH AS WE CAN

01:30:32.660 --> 01:30:33.194
WITH EXTERNAL PARTNERS WE HAVE

01:30:33.261 --> 01:30:34.428
EMERGENCY HOUSING. MOST

01:30:34.495 --> 01:30:36.597
STUDENTS DON'T KNOW THE

01:30:36.664 --> 01:30:40.601
RESOURCES AND SO. ESPECIALLY IF

01:30:40.668 --> 01:30:41.169
I HAD BEEN DOING OUR BEST TO

01:30:41.235 --> 01:30:46.340
COLLAPSE BY. WITH OUR STUDENTS

01:30:46.407 --> 01:30:46.841
WHICH IS ONE OF THE MAIN

01:30:46.908 --> 01:30:47.375
REASONS WE MEET THE- BASIC

01:30:47.441 --> 01:30:48.576
NEEDS OFFICER. JUST BECAUSE

01:30:48.643 --> 01:30:49.143
THAT'S A REAL BIG FOCUS ON

01:30:49.210 --> 01:30:50.611
COMMUNICATION BECAUSE WE CAN

01:30:50.678 --> 01:30:51.245
HAVE ALL THE RESOURCES THAT WE

01:30:51.312 --> 01:30:52.880
DO HAVE THE COMMUNICATIONS WITH

01:30:52.947 --> 01:30:54.582
STUDENTS IS KEY. AND I REALLY

01:30:54.649 --> 01:30:56.551
DO FEEL LIKE SI ON PLAYS A

01:30:56.617 --> 01:31:00.354
CRUCIAL PART IN THAT. YEAH.

01:31:00.421 --> 01:31:04.725
COURSE CAN I ADD TO THAT WE'VE

01:31:04.792 --> 01:31:06.494
ALSO COLLABORATED WITH OUR

01:31:06.561 --> 01:31:08.496
UNIVERSITY POLICE OF THEY ARE

01:31:08.563 --> 01:31:10.498
OUT PATROLLING AND THEY C.

01:31:10.565 --> 01:31:12.333
STUDENT WHO POTENTIALLY MAYBE

01:31:12.400 --> 01:31:12.834
EXPERIENCING HOUSING AND

01:31:12.900 --> 01:31:14.769
SECURITIES THAT THEY PROVIDE

01:31:14.836 --> 01:31:16.671
THEM WITH A HANDOUT THAT HAS

01:31:16.737 --> 01:31:18.906
OUR RESOURCES AND A RACIAL ONE

01:31:18.973 --> 01:31:20.908
BOB I'LL FOLLOW UP FOR ME DO

01:31:20.975 --> 01:31:24.445
YOU FEEL LIKE I MEAN THERE'S A

01:31:24.512 --> 01:31:25.112
LOT OF STUDENTS THAT THAT THAT

01:31:25.179 --> 01:31:26.681
THEY DON'T ENGAGE THEY COME TO

01:31:26.747 --> 01:31:28.583
THE CAMPUS WITH BLINDERS ON. BY

01:31:28.649 --> 01:31:32.453
THEIR CLASS FIND THE RESTROOM

01:31:32.520 --> 01:31:34.522
AND THEN FIND THE CAR AND

01:31:34.589 --> 01:31:35.122
THAT'S ALWAYS A CHALLENGE TO

01:31:35.189 --> 01:31:36.724
DEAL WITH A LOT OF LEVELS BUT

01:31:36.791 --> 01:31:38.693
DO YOU FEEL THAT THE CAMPUS IS

01:31:38.759 --> 01:31:39.227
DOING ENOUGH TO CREATE THE

01:31:39.293 --> 01:31:42.430
AWARENESS LEVEL AT ALL THESE

01:31:42.496 --> 01:31:42.997
ARE THAT THERE'S A LOT OF

01:31:43.064 --> 01:31:44.432
HELPING HANDS HERE THAT'S OVER

01:31:44.498 --> 01:31:44.966
HERE AND THERE'S A LOT OF

01:31:45.032 --> 01:31:46.734
PEOPLE CARE AND WANT TO HELP

01:31:46.801 --> 01:31:48.870
DID YOU FEEL LIKE THAT IS

01:31:48.936 --> 01:31:50.771
ENOUGH BEING DONE SO THAT THE

01:31:50.838 --> 01:31:52.874
STUDENTS THAT ARE HAVE BLINDERS

01:31:52.940 --> 01:31:54.609
ON OR WE'RE GETTING IN THEIR

01:31:54.675 --> 01:31:58.746
SPACE AND. THE RIGHT WAY TO

01:31:58.813 --> 01:31:59.347
COMMUNICATE WITH THEM AND- LET

01:31:59.413 --> 01:32:02.817
THEM KNOW. OUR I WAS ASKED TO

01:32:02.884 --> 01:32:04.685
GET MY FIRST YEAR I WOULD PARK

01:32:04.752 --> 01:32:05.286
COME TO MY CLASS AND LEAVE IT

01:32:05.353 --> 01:32:06.621
WAS ONLY THROUGH. THE STUDENTS

01:32:06.687 --> 01:32:07.154
WHO ENCOURAGED ME TO GET

01:32:07.221 --> 01:32:07.622
INVOLVED BUT I DID GET

01:32:07.688 --> 01:32:08.256
INVOLVED. SO I DEFINITELY KNOW

01:32:08.322 --> 01:32:08.856
THAT STRUGGLE AND I THINK THE

01:32:08.923 --> 01:32:10.791
NEW APPROACH TO MAKING SURE THE

01:32:10.858 --> 01:32:12.593
ADVISORS KNOW ABOUT THESE.

01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:14.795
RESOURCES AND REALLY CONNECTING

01:32:14.862 --> 01:32:16.430
OUR STUDENTS IS WHERE THE MOST

01:32:16.497 --> 01:32:18.432
HELP WILL BE BECAUSE STUDENTS

01:32:18.499 --> 01:32:19.066
ARE FORCED TO GO. TO ADVISE AND

01:32:19.133 --> 01:32:20.501
THEY SHOULD GO TO ADVISING TO

01:32:20.568 --> 01:32:21.135
GRADUATE. BECAUSE THE STUDENTS

01:32:21.202 --> 01:32:22.904
WERE BLINDERS ARE REALLY ABOUT

01:32:22.970 --> 01:32:24.805
GETTING THEIR DEGREE IN GETTING

01:32:24.872 --> 01:32:26.540
OUT. SO I THINK THE MORE

01:32:26.607 --> 01:32:28.609
HOLISTIC APPROACH OF MAKING

01:32:28.676 --> 01:32:29.277
SURE ADVISORS KNOW ABOUT ALL OF

01:32:29.343 --> 01:32:30.811
THESE RESOURCES AND CONNECTING

01:32:30.878 --> 01:32:32.713
STUDENTS. IT'S REALLY A GOOD

01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:34.649
PART ESPECIALLY IN CLASS EVEN

01:32:34.715 --> 01:32:35.283
THOUGH I HAVE NOT BEEN A PART

01:32:35.349 --> 01:32:36.951
OF THE STUDY OR THE CLASS

01:32:37.018 --> 01:32:38.920
COACHING BECAUSE I'M A FOURTH

01:32:38.986 --> 01:32:41.022
YEAR. THE PART OF MAKING SURE

01:32:41.088 --> 01:32:42.690
THAT ADVISERS ARE COACHING THE

01:32:42.757 --> 01:32:44.792
STUDENTS AS WELL AS ADVISING

01:32:44.859 --> 01:32:45.426
THEM ON THEIR ACADEMICS I THINK

01:32:45.493 --> 01:32:48.629
MAKES THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE.

01:32:48.696 --> 01:32:50.598
THAT'S CERTAINLY A BIG INDOOR.

01:32:50.665 --> 01:32:51.132
SPIN ABOUT DOCTOR LIVING.

01:32:51.198 --> 01:32:56.904

ACROSS THE BOARD TO THE OTHER

01:32:59.340 --> 01:33:00.541
COLLEGES HERE BUT CERTAINLY I.

01:33:00.608 --> 01:33:01.008
IT'S A GOOD POINT OF

01:33:01.075 --> 01:33:02.710
AFFIRMATION FOR THAT GOOD WORK

01:33:02.777 --> 01:33:03.344
OF. CONNECTING EVEN IF IT'S ON

01:33:03.411 --> 01:33:04.779
THE ACADEMIC SIDE. IT'S ANOTHER

01:33:04.845 --> 01:33:06.847
OPPORTUNITY FOR A TOUCH THAT

01:33:06.914 --> 01:33:08.649
